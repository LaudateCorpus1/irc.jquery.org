[00:28:41] <iaj> Hey guys!  Sorry already asked that yesterday but seemed like not a good time back then :D I got a question, if someone can hint me into a direction I'd be very grateful -- I wanna have a nice hover effect that shows an image of the product once the user hovers over the textual link of it... Are there some nice solutions for that?
[00:30:54] <Cork> iaj: check one of the many tooltip plugins
[00:31:06] <phpcoder> hello
[00:31:07] <iaj> so the stuff im looking for is tooltip?
[00:31:10] <iaj> thanks Cork
[00:31:19] <iaj> not a native english speaker ^^
[00:31:20] <phpcoder> is there a way to detect a redirect using $.ajax ?
[00:31:47] <Cork> phpcoder: no, the spec for xmlhttprequest explicitly says it should be invisible to the script
[00:32:34] <phpcoder> my problem is that i am using a modal to login....if the credentials are correct i should redirect the user
[00:32:46] <phpcoder> i mean the login.php page redirect the user to his dashboard
[00:33:14] <Cork> phpcoder: you would have to grab the content from the dashboard and inject it into the page
[00:33:22] <Cork> (it would be in the ajax response)
[00:33:29] <Cork> or you would have to not use ajax for the login
[00:33:55] <phpcoder> Cork, i must use ajax becuase i am using the modal..so if there are error i will show a message on that modal
[00:34:12] <phpcoder> ok i get return the url of the dashboard and i will redirect the user using js
[00:34:31] <Cork> phpcoder: ya, that is what you have to do
[00:34:47] <Cork> phpcoder: an option is to have the sever set the url in a http header
[00:35:12] <Cork> but ya, if you want to redirect the page, you are better of just returning a 200 instead of 3xx
[00:35:20] <Cork> and then have js redirect the page
[00:35:24] <phpcoder> Cork, yes php set the redirect
[00:35:29] <phpcoder> i mean... 302 http redirect
[00:35:42] <Cork> ya, and that is what i meant you should avoid
[00:36:03] <Cork> as that means the ajax login will first success to login, then load the dashboard html from the new target
[00:36:10] <Cork> and then you grab the url and load it again
[00:36:15] <Cork> kinda wasteful
[00:36:36] <phpcoder> so i cannot read the "location" n the headers
[00:36:37] <phpcoder> ok
[00:36:44] <phpcoder> i will return the url of the dashboard
[00:36:52] <Cork> no cause like i said 3xx responses are invisible to js
[00:37:00] <phpcoder> yes ok...
[00:37:02] <Cork> to js they do not exist, at all
[00:37:23] <Cork> what js sees is a post and a later 200 response from the redirected target
[00:37:31] <phpcoder> i will return a stringwith url because i cant inject the content
[00:37:34] <phpcoder> yes exactly
[00:37:44] <phpcoder> i see the content of the dashboard in the modal :D i must avoid it
[00:37:52] <phpcoder> okay! thanks Cork
[00:38:31] <phpcoder> Cork, the "problem" is that
[00:38:36] <phpcoder> i always return a string
[00:38:40] <phpcoder> or with the content of the login
[00:38:45] <phpcoder> or with the URL of the dashboard
[00:38:55] <Cork> if you can modify the modal
[00:38:58] <phpcoder> how can i undertstand if it is an url or a content
[00:39:04] <phpcoder> of the login "page" ?
[00:39:05] <Cork> make it return a 406 on a failed login
[00:39:11] <Cork> and then a 200 with the target url on success
[00:39:29] <Cork> then you just use .fail and .done for the two states
[00:40:33] <phpcoder> oh ok so i can return a 406 with the page content
[00:40:39] <phpcoder> if success 200
[00:40:43] <Cork> yes
[00:40:59] <Cork> or you could just return json
[00:41:00] <phpcoder> js can read 406
[00:41:03] <phpcoder> hmm it is HTTP Error 406 Not acceptable
[00:41:07] <Cork> thats another option
[00:41:27] <phpcoder> Cork, do you mean i can try to read the content if i can read it is json otherwise not
[00:41:42] <phpcoder> Cork, if i use 406 i must use error() callback
[00:41:44] <phpcoder> right?
[00:41:58] <Cork> phpcoder: { error: error_message_what_ever_it_is }
[00:42:05] <Cork> phpcoder: or { location: new_url }
[00:42:19] <Cork> then you just check if location or error exist
[00:42:35] <Cork> phpcoder: yes, 4xx triggers the .fail callback
[00:42:54] <Cork> phpcoder: note json and 406 are two different solutions
[00:43:09] <Cork> both works, it just depends on what you need/prefer
[00:47:29] <phpcoder> Cork, i can try to send a json {location:}
[00:47:42] <phpcoder> so each time i see if there is "location" inside my data
[00:48:00] <phpcoder> i think sounds better because i avoid to send an "error" code when i load the modal
[00:48:04] <Cork> phpcoder: make sure you send the correct content type
[00:48:17] <Cork> the you just do if(data.location) {} else {}
[00:49:39] <YamakasY> I have some javascript which does not conflict but in some way the unused js scrolls my page down because of some init or so which it sees... what is best, exclude that whole JS file as I don't need it on my other $_GET states ?
[00:49:52] <phpcoder> Cork, oh right i must return json content in the headers
[00:50:13] <phpcoder> so Cork i set it to json with it is ok...otherwise a normal html content
[00:53:31] <Cork> phpcoder: or you just always return json for that resournce and encode the html in the json
[01:01:31] <phpcoder> Cork, ok
[01:01:32] <phpcoder> thanks
[01:04:56] <phpcoder> Cork, is there a nice way to avoid converting all the html in json? imean...i should look at the lenght of the response... if it is above 250 chars it is a html content otherwise an url
[01:04:59] <phpcoder> should works ?
[01:05:31] <Cork> phpcoder: you can conditionally change the content-type header
[01:05:39] <Cork> but no you should not sniff the content
[01:06:10] <Cork> if(typeof(data) == "object") is one option
[01:06:53] <iaj> Cork: Do you happen to know if tooltipster is a nice choice for having image overlays?
[01:07:03] <Cork> never heard of it
[01:07:17] <iaj> Oh.. haha.. was the second hit on google :D
[01:07:23] <iaj> Which one do you usually use?
[01:07:55] <phpcoder> Cork, with "not sniff" are you referring to avoid counting the chars of the content ?
[01:08:01] <Cork> if you already use jquery ui i would use its tooltip plugin
[01:08:15] <phpcoder> Cork,  if i set it to json i can check it via if(typeof(data) == "object") directly
[01:08:16] <phpcoder> right ?
[01:08:21] <Cork> phpcoder: checking if the response is json by sniffing what is in it
[01:08:32] <Cork> and counting characters is a REALLY poor way of doing that
[01:08:37] <anli> I am tweaking some in the developer tools, would be nice to get a list of what I did, the diff so to say
[01:08:47] <Cork> phpcoder: yes html will make data a string
[01:08:48] <anli> Is that possible to do in either chrome or ff?
[01:08:51] <Cork> and json is an object or array
[01:09:05] <iaj> Cork: ah, thanks! Yeah.. will do :)
[01:09:28] <phpcoder> Cork, i will set json on headers
[01:09:30] <phpcoder> okay
[01:09:42] <Cork> phpcoder: you don't need to check for the header
[01:09:53] <Cork> jquery will already manage that
[01:10:02] <phpcoder> Cork, no no imeant i set json on the headers from php
[01:10:09] <phpcoder> and jquery will looks at the easily
[01:10:16] <phpcoder> and transfor it on object
[01:10:16] <Cork> ya
[01:11:25] <phpcoder> okay thanks!! :)
[01:15:29] <hellyeah> hey why there is no animation in gray row? https://jsfiddle.net/52qs3fyn/27/
[01:21:26] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/vqh99pr9/ if i wanne add a tr to the 3 first rows how do i doo that?
[01:22:01] <Whiskey> i know how to add the code, but how to select them correct:D
[01:22:02] <Cork> huh?
[01:22:06] <Cork> you can't add tr in a tr
[01:22:14] <Whiskey> oo sorry td
[01:22:17] <Cork> ah
[01:22:53] <Cork> btw you prob want to use :nth-child not eq
[01:23:10] <iaj> Cork: when I can run jQuery(".something").tooltip({content: "something"});   without an error message in the console, that means that jQueryUI is available right?
[01:24:15] <Cork> Whiskey: $('table.FileInfo tr:nth-child(-n03)').append('<td></td>') for example
[01:25:08] <Cork> iaj: tooltip doesn't work like that
[01:25:24] <Cork> iaj: but ya, it means the plugin works
[01:25:27] <Whiskey> Cork, what makes tth-child batter
[01:25:36] <Cork> iaj: you should read this example https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[01:25:44] <Cork> Whiskey: it is native to the browser
[01:26:02] <Cork> Whiskey: so instead of selecting all the trs and then picking out one with js
[01:26:08] <Cork> you just get the ones actually matching
[01:26:36] <Cork> Whiskey: though note nth-child isn't exactly the same as eq
[01:26:48] <Cork> though i think nth-child is actually what your looking for in the code
[01:26:57] <iaj> Cork: alright, yeah that's exaclty what I will need anyway :D
[01:27:31] <Whiskey> ok
[01:29:35] <iaj> Cork: im just curious because I cannot find any jquery-ui or jqueryui paths in the sourcecode of the page
[01:30:07] <Cork> iaj: ah, jquery ui is built up of plugins
[01:30:16] <Cork> if you download the normal package all the plugins are included
[01:30:30] <iaj> Owhww.. ok :D thanks and sorry :)
[01:30:33] <Cork> iaj: here is the picker http://jqueryui.com/download/
[01:30:44] <Cork> (note the widgets section)
[01:32:07] <iaj> but this generates a jquery-ui file doesn't it?
[01:32:18] <Cork> yes
[01:32:21] <iaj> which I then have to add to the pagesource?
[01:32:24] <iaj> normally?
[01:32:36] <Cork> depends on how you include it
[01:32:51] <Cork> you could also have a jquery-ui-core, and each plugin separately
[01:33:04] <Cork> but ya, normally it is bundled into one big file
[01:33:16] <iaj> so its normally the basic jquery lib + jquery ui ?
[01:33:33] <Cork> again it depends on how you get it/download it
[01:33:55] <Cork> but if you get it from one of the cdns or through a jquery package, it is normally the full bundle
[01:34:15] <Whiskey> Cork, it was not what i was looking for, but i think that will be alot more easy to manage
[01:34:19] <iaj> can I find out via console where a certain funtion is coming from?
[01:34:25] <iaj> function*
[01:34:34] <Cork> iaj: coming from?
[01:34:48] <Cork> if you mean something like what url it was loaded from, then no
[01:34:59] <iaj> yeah like, from which scriptfile the function is called from
[01:35:05] <iaj> wow. :(
[01:35:09] <Cork> javascript has no concept of "files"
[01:35:18] <iaj> odd. I thought I could find out somehow
[01:35:20] <Cork> it is all just a big scope that things gets loaded into
[01:35:34] <Cork> you can with the browser developer tools (normally)
[01:35:40] <Cork> but js doesn't
[01:36:44] <iaj> ok... could it be that the javascript file from bootstrap includes jqueryui?
[01:36:56] <Cork> i don't remember
[01:37:28] <iaj> I grepped for 'tooltip(' in my files and somehow found somehting about bootstrap.min.js
[01:37:49] <Whiskey> Cork: can you change <td colspan="2" style="width: 126px;"> colspan to 3 and how do you do it whit jQuery? as it not is CSS
[01:37:54] <iaj> Question is, what tooltip is that :D oh well I'll rebuild the example you gave me and just see if that works.
[01:38:18] <Cork> Whiskey: prop('colspan', 3)
[01:38:28] <Whiskey> aa not attr?
[01:38:47] <Cork> Whiskey: attr is for modifying attributes not dom properties
[01:38:53] <Cork> (and you rarely want to use attr)
[01:39:16] <Whiskey> :)
[01:41:28] <iaj> Cork: I get that one: Uncaught Error: `selector` option must be specified when initializing tooltip on the window.document object!   from bootstrap.min.js  << so that means I'm currently running a different tooltip right?
[01:42:39] <Cork> possibly
[01:43:21] <Cork> iaj: what does $.fn.tooltip.Constructor.VERSION give you?
[01:44:30] <iaj> "3.3.4"
[01:44:35] <Cork> then yes
[01:44:40] <Cork> that isn't jquery ui
[01:45:01] <iaj> hm.. ok.. thought so :( If I attach jqueryui also
[01:45:10] <iaj> and run tooltip().. which one is gonna be used :D ?
[01:45:20] <Cork> you would prob get a conflict
[01:45:24] <iaj> do I have to include jqueryui after bootstrap?
[01:45:35] <Cork> you shouldn't include both
[01:46:43] <iaj> hm, then use a different plugin? Or what would be a wise choice?
[01:47:27] <Cork> check if the bootstrap one works for you
[01:47:38] <Cork> if it doesn't see if you can get a version without it
[01:53:42] <iaj> Cork: yeah, im gonna stick with that, http://embed.plnkr.co/nhlFPz/preview
[01:53:49] <iaj> that's tooltip on bootstrap
[02:00:37] <Duikb00t> Does recursive just mean in the opposite order?
[02:00:44] <Duikb00t> As in 'recursive array'
[02:01:56] <Cork> Duikb00t: what context are you talking about?
[02:02:13] <Duikb00t> I was just reading some articles in so
[02:02:32] <Duikb00t> on* Stack Overflow and saw 'recursive arrays' but it does not yet make sense to me
[02:03:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: well it is so, what do you expect
[02:03:15] <Duikb00t> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10873107/recursive-array
[02:03:29] <Cork> so is a big pile of manure
[02:03:54] <Cork> ya, he means multi dimentional arrays
[02:04:04] <Whiskey> Cork: what is wrong here, http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/1/
[02:04:05] <Cork> or nested arrays
[02:04:11] <Duikb00t> ok
[02:04:34] <Whiskey> lol
[02:04:34] <Whiskey> :D
[02:05:02] <Duikb00t> Whiskey what is wrong?
[02:05:08] <rabbi1> Hi, how can i conditionally open/ hide collapse element. i need to show only if it is hidden
[02:05:19] <rabbi1> i am using bootstrap collapse
[02:05:19] <Cork> Whiskey: it does what you're asking for
[02:05:32] <Cork> Whiskey: it changes the last td in the table to colspan="3"
[02:05:34] <Duikb00t> Cork :P that answer always works
[02:05:36] <Whiskey> Well it supose to add the subdir on 3 first rows next to the other
[02:05:54] <Whiskey> Well it supose to add the subdir on 3 first rows next to the others and not last row. Atm i looks like it do it but also break th etable :D
[02:06:09] <Cork> ah that one
[02:06:21] <Cork> well -n03 != -n+3
[02:06:57] <Cork> Whiskey: but it appears to do the same thing
[02:07:02] <Cork> Whiskey: you are using after though
[02:07:06] <Whiskey> well in the test case i got it right
[02:07:10] <Cork> so you try to add the td after the td not in it
[02:07:24] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/aeyh1395/2/
[02:07:53] <Whiskey> yeh append does it
[02:09:14] <Whiskey> Thanks again Cork :)
[02:10:11] <Whiskey> Time to take a shower :)
[02:24:57] <iaj> Is there an easy way like if I have $('.something')  to select the div that "contains" so to speak, the .something class?
[02:25:14] <iaj> the actual markup is div > p > .something
[02:25:27] <Cork> iaj: $('.something').parent()
[02:25:44] <Cork> css selectors doesn't have a way to select backwards cause of performance problems with that
[02:27:29] <iaj> perfect Cork if you'd be living in Germany I'd get you a beer for sure :D
[02:27:43] <Cork> heh
[02:28:13] <Cork> and i would be a complete drunkard if i had accepted all the beers i've been offered
[02:28:48] <Cork> (one guy actually offered to mail me a package O_o)
[02:28:55] <iaj> xDD
[02:29:44] <iaj> Can imagine..
[02:43:31] <abishek> how to get the XML string from an XML document that was created using $.parseXML()?
[02:45:33] <Cork> abishek: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Parsing_and_serializing_XML#Part_2_how_to_serialize_the_content_of_a_given_XML_document
[02:46:38] <abishek> Cork, thnx let me give this a try
[02:48:06] <abishek> Cork, is the browser compatible?
[02:48:32] <Cork> i think you need to special case older ie if you care about those
[02:48:47] <abishek> OK
[02:48:55] <Cork> i avoid using xml for data transfer on the web if i have a chance
[02:49:05] <Cork> abishek: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XMLSerializer#Browser_compatibility
[02:49:16] <Cork> so ie9+
[03:12:00] <SpongeJr> Khan Academy just released a great new jQuery course: http://cs-blog.khanacademy.org/2015/09/new-course-learn-jquery-with-our.html
[03:19:00] <arc_> kinda weird. to me it seems like learning jquery is incredibly easy
[03:19:08] <arc_> learning javascript is the hard part
[03:23:25] <mikunos> hi guys, how have I to get the "Select" object with name "category_id" created into a form called "event"?
[03:24:02] <mikunos> $("select[name=category_id]").val()  ...
[03:24:19] <mikunos> this get the Select object in the page
[03:24:31] <mikunos> I need to get the Select into a event form
[03:24:49] <mikunos> how have I to specify the form name in the selection?
[03:26:06] <mikunos> any hint?
[03:26:59] <arc_> can you change the html?
[03:27:16] <mikunos> yes
[03:27:40] <arc_> wait, i must be missing something here
[03:28:47] <arc_> what is that select[] syntax
[03:29:02] <arc_> oh a select form
[03:29:55] <arc_> so what do you want to do with that
[03:30:40] <SpongeJr> arc_, well, they've got JS content as well
[03:31:14] <arc_> they would pretty much have to
[03:33:32] <Unbeerable> Hi. I'm using jquery ui tooltip for all items '$(document).tooltip()'. If I have a link which removes itself from DOM, then tooltip stays open. Like here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/2298
[03:34:17] <Unbeerable> the suggested solution is to remove/hide this tooltip manually, but I can't, because it attached to document, and not the element
[03:34:47] <Unbeerable> so it tell's me about calling a method prior to initialization. What can I do?
[03:42:33] <computer2000> How can I find all elements that contain a certain string?
[03:42:44] <computer2000> Throughout the whole HTML
[03:52:59] <Cork> computer2000: you should avoid doing selections like that
[03:53:11] <computer2000> Cork: it's a emergency hack.
[03:53:16] <Cork> you have to select all elements loop all of them and check the content
[03:53:21] <computer2000> Cork: I know
[03:53:25] <Cork> it is a really bad idea
[03:53:28] <computer2000> I know
[03:55:35] <Cork> computer2000: $('*').filter(function() { var clone = $(this).clone(); clone.find('*').remove(); return clone.html() == content })
[03:56:00] <Cork> you really REALLY should avoid using that except for testing
[03:59:13] <decx> i never used it but wouldnt the treewalker api be appropriate here
[04:00:11] <Cork> decx: woldn't make much difference
[04:00:23] <Cork> the costly part is that you have to clone each element to make the test
[04:01:13] <Cork> treewalker is meant to be used to make a lot of changes in the dom
[04:01:23] <computer2000> If you reduce the test samples so you don't test the whole html it's still not good practice but ok for my case
[04:01:26] <Cork> not to make selections based on content
[04:01:45] <Cork> computer2000: it is really horrible code
[04:01:56] <Cork> computer2000: why can't you make a sane fix instead?
[04:02:18] <Cork> like giving the elements a class for example
[04:02:23] <computer2000> Cork: because my client just really wants to exchange all occurences of a string to something else
[04:02:35] <computer2000> can't access the buildup of html
[04:02:38] <Cork> O_o
[04:02:40] <computer2000> speak backend
[04:02:44] <Cork> ugg...
[04:03:00] <Cork> man i'm SOOO happy i don't work for a place that split client side and server side
[04:03:24] <Cork> i'm getting tired of hearing of all these horrible hacks cause "i don't have access"
[04:03:25] <computer2000> I don't as well normally but this project is on cargo collective so can only access client side code
[04:04:08] <Cork> hmm
[04:04:19] <Cork> ah, so you don't want to select the elements by the content
[04:04:27] <Cork> you actually want to modify it
[04:04:35] <Cork> that would actually be a candidate for treewalker
[04:04:36] <computer2000> Cork: xtly
[04:05:00] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker
[04:05:06] <computer2000> will look into it thx
[04:05:07] <Cork> just set it to only select text nodes
[04:05:24] <Cork> and then you are basically down to a fairly simple regex replace
[04:05:39] <computer2000> yup
[04:05:49] <Cork> and it would be a lot cleaner then the horrible selector i gave you
[04:06:10] <Cork> i thought you wanted to make something style based on the content or something like that
[04:06:44] <computer2000> I actually need to select all occurences of a string so to wrap it into an element so I can style it through css lol
[04:07:12] <Cork> so you where actually trying to do what i was afraid of...
[04:07:23] <Cork> ya, treewalker won't help you there
[04:08:59] <Kartagis> sooo newb question, but what does Initialize with $.fn.cropper method mean? what do I write?
[04:09:10] * Kartagis hangs head in shame
[04:14:08] <K4T> can someone help me with this: https://gist.github.com/K4T/39e29421a4ae3f66ef07 ?
[04:14:22] <K4T> How to move all .autor spans to the end of parent?
[04:14:52] <PCatinean> When a div.class is clicked, how does one remove active from all other elements with this description, make all img nested inside it loose the -active from "blabla-active.png" and add active to the image in the element clicked?
[04:19:50] <Cork> K4T: $('.autor').each(function() { $(this).parent().append(this); });
[04:22:35] <Kartagis> sooo newb question, but what does Initialize with $.fn.cropper method mean? what do I write?
[04:22:37] * Kartagis hangs head in shame
[04:29:49] <K4T> Cork, thank you
[04:30:23] <Cork> Kartagis: it means you should select the element you want to work with and run .copper() on it
[04:30:32] <Cork> *cropper
[04:31:30] <Kartagis> so, $('img').cropper(); is what I want?
[04:31:37] <Cork> yes
[04:40:49] <Kamuela> morning jquery
[04:42:52] <Kartagis> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'cropper'
[04:45:34] <Cork> Kartagis: that means you don't have cropper loaded
[04:46:22] <Kartagis> it is src'd
[04:48:12] <_el_fer_> Hi all in jquery
[05:16:11] <_el_fer_> hey guys, which browser do you feel more comfortable working with? I mean considering inspector, console, available plugins, etc
[05:28:55] <absklb> hi
[05:29:06] <absklb> how to execute more than one REST API ajax call sequestially?
[05:29:15] <absklb> one after another
[05:30:36] <_el_fer_> maybe using .when ?
[05:31:16] <absklb> ok
[05:31:18] <_el_fer_> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[05:32:03] <PCatinean> Cork, is this script any good? http://hastebin.com/benuqitace.coffee
[05:33:14] <absklb> _el_fer_: thanks
[05:33:21] <Cork> PCatinean: i would prob move line 5 out of the each loop
[05:33:29] <Cork> but other then that it looks ok
[05:33:48] <Cork> $('div.how_icon.active').removeClass('active').each(function(){
[05:33:53] <PCatinean> I'm surprised, I almost never do Jquery
[05:33:56] <PCatinean> ahhh, cool :D
[05:33:57] <PCatinean> thank you!
[05:34:20] <Cork> PCatinean: also you might want to delegate the click handler
[05:34:34] <Cork> so you don't have to add so many handlers
[05:35:06] <PCatinean> I forgot how that went
[05:35:47] <Cork> $('static-parent').on('click', 'div.how_icon', function() {})
[05:36:29] <PCatinean> like body?
[05:36:38] <PCatinean> I wonder why this method isn't as advertised as it should
[05:36:43] <Cork> never bind an event handler against body
[05:36:50] <Cork> use document if you need to go that far up
[05:37:04] <Cork> (it is basically the same)
[06:11:48] <robhol> Cork: how come?
[06:12:51] <Cork> robhol: never might have been a bit harsh, but: document is a global you have direct access to (no need for a selector)
[06:13:04] <Cork> also some events jquery fire are on document, and won't work on body
[06:13:10] <robhol> ah, I see
[06:13:10] <Cork> those are the main reasons
[06:14:05] <Cork> also the comment was specifically for delegate
[06:14:31] <Cork> there are reasons to bind click on body instead of document (as body is actually an element that doesn't have to be the full document height)
[06:40:27] <absklb> _el_fer_: is it ok if i just put next ajax inside first ajaxs .then(function) ?
[06:44:15] <_el_fer_> yeah in general I guess that sounds good
[06:58:44] <absklb> sv
[06:58:46] <absklb> ok
[07:08:22] <halcyone3> when using $().load(...) is there a way to, say, select the 3rd element that it matches? For example if I've got 10   │ Alcubierre
[07:08:24] <halcyone3>               │                          | divs in my target file with class name "content" can I do something like $("#body).load("target_file.html             │ Alex`
[07:08:26] <halcyone3>               │                          | .content").getFifth() (just an example). Thanks :)
[07:08:29] <halcyone3> ahhhhh, sorry!
[07:09:13] <halcyone3> I just asked the question in javascript and was told I should ask it here so tried to paste it across...badly. The question again is:
[07:10:59] <halcyone3> when using $().load(...) is there a way to, say, select the 3rd element that it matches? for example if I've got 10 divs in my target file with class name "content", can I do something like $("#body).load("targetfile.html .content").getFifth() (just an example). Thanks :)

[07:19:17] <Vetaxili> Hi, I'm trying to create an if statement like so: if (val1 != val2) { ... }. When debugging I notice that both values are primitive values of 8. Although they seem to be the same they end up passing through my "if" check
[07:28:21] <Uhkis> Vetaxili: parseInt()
[07:29:41] <Vetaxili> Ah! Of course. <facepalm> Thank you Uhkis :-)

[07:52:20] <dumptruckman> Hello
[07:52:46] <dumptruckman> I'm working with appery.io and i'm attempting to change a list item's icon on click
[07:52:59] <dumptruckman> I have the event in there and everything I'm trying does not produce a changed icon
[07:53:20] <dumptruckman> most things I've found say this is the correct way: button.attr('data-icon', 'star').find('.ui-icon').removeClass('ui-icon-carat').addClass('ui-icon-star');
[08:07:45] <tona> hello folks
[08:08:31] <tona> i would like to create some charts using Jquery could you recommend me some link please , i will appreciate any advice, i would like to create a cute graphics
[08:09:13] <lvegerano> hello all I'm having a bit of trouble setting some style to an iframe that is being appended here is the example https://jsfiddle.net/9arnvLuL/
[08:17:55] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/5/ <-- how do i add two tr before the last tr?
[08:17:59] <Whiskey> I just manage to do one
[08:26:44] <tona> i would like to create some charts using Jquery could you recommend me some link please , i will appreciate any advice, i would like to create a cute graphics
[08:35:51] <Whiskey> charts?
[08:35:56] <Whiskey> whit jQuery?
[08:36:25] <Whiskey> tona: why not use https://developers.google.com/chart/?
[08:36:41] <tona> Ok Whiskey
[08:37:46] <tona> Excellent Whiskey this is a great site, thanks for it
[08:39:23] <Whiskey> np :)
[08:39:25] <tona> Whiskey just one question more, is there one way to download that library into my computer, problaly this is a great site but i need to have internte acess to read that library google
[08:39:46] <Whiskey> yes it is i don´t know how as i don´t use it myself let me see if i can find it
[08:39:47] <decx> chart.js is the most popular on github
[08:40:06] <decx> also flot.js and highcharts
[08:40:38] <dumptruckman> ahh, i figured out why it wasn't working..
[08:40:59] <dumptruckman> my list is created dynamically... viewing the html there is only 1 list item
[08:41:28] <dumptruckman> when i change that element specifically it works to change the first list item.... i need to change the list item being clicked
[08:41:33] <Whiskey> :)
[08:43:12] <dumptruckman> any clue how to find the selector of the clicked list item?
[08:51:09] <hassoon> do you guys think the transition effects in jquery triggered by specifying a duration in ms in e.g hide(n) or show(n) demanding for the cpu?
[08:51:56] <duch_kazatel> hassoon wrong question.
[08:52:10] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: i'm sorry what ?
[08:52:18] <duch_kazatel> hassoon don't prematurely optimize - if you're seeing perf issues, address them.
[08:52:21] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, don't worry about it.
[08:52:39] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: i'm judging it from my cpu temp :p
[08:52:52] <hassoon> it goes up to like 56°c from 52 or soth
[08:52:53] <hassoon> *sth
[08:52:53] <duch_kazatel> hassoon CPU temp is not a good barometer.  profile the page.
[08:53:02] <duch_kazatel> use your dev tools.
[08:53:03] <hassoon> duch_kazatel: sorry what you mean profile the page
[08:53:08] <hassoon> ah
[08:53:10] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman got here halfway through your question - have any code.
[08:53:24] <duch_kazatel> hassoon use the developer tools' profiler and go from there.
[08:53:39] * hassoon opens Firebug
[08:53:39] <duch_kazatel> but CPU temp is not a reliable performance metric for a page ;)
[08:53:49] <duch_kazatel> nor will it tell you what exactly is causing your headaches.
[08:53:56] <hassoon> ah
[08:59:27] <dumptruckman> duch_kazatel: hmm, well, there's this which is generated by appery.io http://pastie.org/10452315
[09:00:50] <dumptruckman> in the editor window i'm give a "this" but i've found that it DOES NOT represent the list item clicked
[09:01:14] <Whiskey> baa
[09:01:18] <dumptruckman> so in that paste you can see i've indicated the "template" list item
[09:01:22] <dumptruckman> and am changing that
[09:01:27] <dumptruckman> which only changes the first item in the list
[09:05:27] <felix89> hi!
[09:05:47] <felix89> i have a <select> element which I need to add the attribut `multiple` to
[09:05:59] <felix89> however `$.attr` always wants a value
[09:13:28] <Uhkis> prop
[09:16:45] <felix89> Uhkis: it also wants a value: http://api.jquery.com/prop/#prop2
[09:17:01] <Uhkis> true
[09:18:03] <Whiskey> well im stuck
[09:22:56] <dumptruckman> what is this selector telling me? #screen_Initiative [dsid="[object HTMLLIElement]"]:eq(0)
[09:23:10] <dumptruckman> i'm a js/jquery noob
[09:28:36] <hapi> this is a wrongly parsed response
[09:29:01] <hapi> i think, but if you show full code maybe i can give you detailed answer
[09:29:07] <dumptruckman> ahh, i'm getting closer
[09:29:16] <dumptruckman> i need to be working with the event rather than this
[09:29:30] <dumptruckman> however, the event has a different target based on where in the list item i click
[09:29:40] <dumptruckman> as there is a grid inside the list item which is full of stuff
[09:29:50] <dumptruckman> is it possible to make components "unclickable"?
[09:30:04] <hapi> which components?
[09:30:21] <hapi> everything is which firing any event can stoppable
[09:30:38] <dumptruckman> well, it's like, i want it to pass through to the list item
[09:30:43] <dumptruckman> rather than the target being a grid cell
[09:31:01] <dumptruckman> the list item is what contains the event code
[09:31:12] <dumptruckman> but the target varies apparently
[09:31:29] <hapi> hard to answer without example
[09:31:52] <dumptruckman> yeah.. hard to give an example
[09:33:04] <speedio> im trying to make a div clickable in jquery, https://paste.debian.net/313951/ , but cant make it work.. what have i done wrong?
[09:33:20] <dumptruckman> hapi: http://i.imgur.com/4SCDdBC.png
[09:33:46] <dumptruckman> so, when i click on the button icon, the event.target is the list item
[09:33:57] <dumptruckman> if i click on the name, for example, the target is a label
[09:34:07] <dumptruckman> i want the target to always be the list item
[09:34:51] <Navelpluisje> speedio: You have to build the dom before adding an eventlistener to it. Otherwise you can use 'on'
[09:35:24] <speedio> Navelpluisje: ok, i guess i have to read some more about jquery..thanks
[09:35:51] <hapi> dumptruckman, then place your click handler to the list item
[09:35:59] <hapi> you cannot modify the target
[09:36:28] <Navelpluisje> speedio: yep. take a look @ http://api.jquery.com/on/. All their documentation is pretty straight forward
[09:38:07] <dumptruckman> hapi: the click handler is on the list item as far as i can tell
[09:39:47] <dumptruckman> i want clicking on the name to trigger the list item click
[09:42:23] <Navelpluisje> dumptruckman: a bit hacky, but something like the next should work: $(name).click(function() {$(list-item).trigger(click)})
[09:43:24] <dumptruckman> ah
[09:44:27] <hassoon> shouldn't $("#vente").find('input[name=vente_client]:[value='+$(this).val())+']')  find the <input> element ,in <div id='vente'>, whose name = vente_client, and value = $(this).val() ?
[09:45:04] <dumptruckman> getting the list item component that has the buttonMarkup function from the event is proving to be trouble
[09:51:37] <dumptruckman> maybe i can cycle up the parent chain until i find a list item?
[09:51:54] <dumptruckman> question is, how would i tell if the current element is a list item?
[09:54:44] <dumptruckman> this is what the event.target looks like http://pastie.org/10452398
[09:54:55] <dumptruckman> how could i check that the class contains "ui-btn"
[09:54:56] <dumptruckman> ?
[09:57:44] <NoiseEee> dumptruckman: https://api.jquery.com/hasclass/
[09:57:47] <sadtaco> I have something like <div class="container"><div class="container"><a class="find-me" /></div></div>.  Now, I have both .container selected as a cached selector var. How do I see if container has .find-me but not if it's a subcontainer? IE, it should find it in the inner one but not the outer one.
[09:58:03] <sadtaco> since .find('.find-me') will find one that is nested deep down.
[09:58:23] <sadtaco> .find('.find-me:not(.container .find-me)') isn't going to work either.
[09:58:26] <dumptruckman> NoiseEee: thanks!
[09:58:26] <NoiseEee> sadtaco: http://api.jquery.com/children/
[09:58:45] <NoiseEee> sadtaco: "The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree "
[09:58:54] <sadtaco> Right that's one row... .find-me isn't actually top level but I can find its parent and search that. Mkay.
[09:58:56] <dumptruckman> NoiseEee: further though, can i just do $(event.target).hasClass?
[09:58:58] <sadtaco> one depth*
[09:59:11] <NoiseEee> dumptruckman: of course
[09:59:22] <sadtaco> k I'll do that I was thinking there would be a less structure dependant way if I move some things around
[09:59:54] <dumptruckman> ahhh, that's perfect, thank you
[10:05:11] <dumptruckman> hah, now even the input boxes trigger it
[10:05:25] <dumptruckman> i don't get why all the elements are trigger this click event
[10:08:27] <NoiseEee> dumptruckman: because events bubble
[10:10:20] <dumptruckman> NoiseEee: what does that mean?
[10:10:33] <dumptruckman> oh
[10:10:51] <dumptruckman> so that all the children inside a component don't stop the event on the parent?
[10:11:27] <NoiseEee> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/an-introduction-to-dom-events/#bubble-phase @ dumptruckman
[10:14:19] <dumptruckman> thanks
[10:37:15] <s2013> hello,  how do i trigger a change for a dropdown.. basically i want to change the text that is being selected
[10:37:17] <s2013> cant figure it out
[10:40:04] <Kamuela> .on('change', func)
[10:46:10] <s2013> no not that
[10:46:19] <s2013> im not asking about what to do when its being changed
[10:46:21] <s2013> i want to change it
[10:46:24] <s2013> Kamuela ^
[10:47:12] <Kamuela> .trigger('select') I think
[10:49:16] <s2013> k let me check
[10:54:05] <s2013> http://jsfiddle.net/phoc8tzx/1/ so i have this.. i want to select different option
[10:54:08] <s2013> how would i do that using jquery
[10:54:29] <duch_kazatel> set the .val() of the select.
[10:54:40] <duch_kazatel> $('select').val('2 year free');
[10:56:01] <s2013> duch_kazatel yeah but iwant to set the text
[10:56:03] <s2013> not the value
[10:56:21] <duch_kazatel> so you want to change the text of an option?
[10:56:27] <s2013> the text is what matters because thats the actual codes
[10:56:35] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:56:39] <s2013> so basically what im doing is i want to dynamcially select the code
[10:56:46] <duch_kazatel> right - that's what .val() will do.
[10:56:48] <s2013> so the text is the actual code.. and value is a description
[10:56:57] <duch_kazatel> you should flip that fwiw.
[10:57:11] <s2013> that wont work
[10:57:19] <ngharo> or make them the same if you want the user to see the code
[10:57:30] <duch_kazatel> yeah something here is code smell.
[10:57:44] <s2013> its not part of a form.. and i didnt build it
[10:57:45] <duch_kazatel> like... http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/phoc8tzx/2/
[10:57:47] <duch_kazatel> this functions.
[10:57:52] <duch_kazatel> so clarify what you really need.
[10:58:04] <s2013> yeah but i dont want to select the description. i want to select the specific text
[10:58:16] <duch_kazatel> "select the specific text" of the selected option?
[10:58:25] <s2013> yeah so if i want to select 1yrfree for example
[10:58:27] <s2013> how would i do that
[10:58:33] <duch_kazatel> use a change event listener.
[10:58:55] <s2013> okay i want the selected option to be 1yrfree
[10:58:57] <s2013> for example
[10:59:03] <s2013> what do i do
[10:59:08] <duch_kazatel> use the change event listener..
[10:59:10] <duch_kazatel> like...
[10:59:29] <s2013> but im not looking for an event listener.. iw ant to change the selected text
[10:59:59] <duch_kazatel> then i have no idea what you want.  i feel like you're skipping part of your explanation.
[11:00:01] <s2013> so right now the default selected is "Please select"
[11:00:36] <s2013> when i change the val it does change to a different select.. thats fine but i want to do it without passing in the value
[11:00:39] <s2013> with only passing in the text
[11:00:52] <duch_kazatel> "passing in" meaning...
[11:01:16] <s2013> $("#id").val("asdfasdf") <-- thats passing in the value
[11:01:23] <s2013> but not the text
[11:01:31] <duch_kazatel> that will "change" the text.
[11:01:38] <s2013> the text is what goes in  between the <option></option>
[11:01:40] <s2013> right
[11:01:47] <s2013> but i want to do that without passing in the value
[11:02:00] <duch_kazatel> so you want to change the value based on the text?
[11:02:12] <s2013> i want to change the selected based on the text
[11:02:27] <s2013> when i load the page
[11:02:36] <duch_kazatel> so then grab the value for that text and set the value.
[11:02:51] <s2013> ... ok its my fault cause im probably not explaining it right
[11:02:57] <s2013> ill just google more and then come back
[11:03:03] <s2013> thanks
[11:03:04] <duch_kazatel> you want to be able to use the text to select one.
[11:03:05] <duch_kazatel> not the value.
[11:03:08] <duch_kazatel> but that's really awkwar.e
[11:03:10] <duch_kazatel> *awkward.
[11:03:25] <duch_kazatel> so get the option whose text matches whatever and grab that value, then set the select with that value.
[11:03:56] <s2013> ok hold on this might explain it better. one sec
[11:05:32] <s2013> http://imgur.com/QEBq5NF duch_kazatel so we have this drop down.. when you select the drop down it populates a box with the value
[11:05:34] <s2013> makes sense so far?
[11:05:41] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[11:06:12] <s2013> so this happens when i physically click on the drop down and choose a text
[11:06:14] <s2013> makes sense?
[11:06:19] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[11:06:46] <s2013> ok so now i want to do that using jquery.. because we are passing in parameter for a specific code for example
[11:06:56] <s2013> so even if its passed in the default optio is "please select"
[11:07:53] <duch_kazatel> so you want to select an item in the dropdown and have it populate a box but still read "please select"?
[11:08:14] <s2013> no... i want it to be dynamically selected
[11:08:41] <s2013> lets say this is in site.com and if i go to site.com?code=abc
[11:08:55] <s2013> i want to be able to have the default selected option to be the one whose text is abc
[11:08:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/phoc8tzx/4/
[11:09:22] <duch_kazatel> i feel like this might be what you want.
[11:09:27] <s2013> let me check
[11:09:31] <duch_kazatel> you have 1yrfree and need to select that option by default.
[11:09:41] <s2013> yeah that seems like it
[11:09:46] <s2013> ok thanks
[11:10:04] <duch_kazatel> i said that before.
[11:10:07] <duch_kazatel> but okay :)
[11:13:30] <Whiskey> s2013: you good on jQuery?
[11:13:39] <s2013> huh
[11:13:44] <Whiskey> it was a question :D
[11:13:46] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey if you have a question, ask the channel pls :)
[11:13:47] <Whiskey> as im stuck :D
[11:14:01] <duch_kazatel> almost 700 people in here ;)
[11:14:05] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/5/ <-- how do i add two tr before the last tr?
[11:14:35] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+insert+before
[11:14:46] <duch_kazatel> should be at or near the top of that list Whiskey
[11:15:40] <Whiskey> well that don´t change the result duch_kazatel
[11:15:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:16:30] <Whiskey> Filename:
[11:16:32] <Whiskey> 	
[11:16:34] <Whiskey> FileSize:
[11:16:35] <Whiskey> baa
[11:16:40] <Whiskey> but it only insert one or none
[11:17:48] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:18:12] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: yeh im here
[11:18:19] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[11:19:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ef6kpv7x/
[11:19:31] <duch_kazatel> here you go.
[11:19:39] <duch_kazatel> insert two TRs before the last one.
[11:21:07] <Whiskey> But get it work in this one?
[11:21:08] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/5/
[11:21:20] <duch_kazatel> try
[11:21:32] <duch_kazatel> show me where you're getting lost.
[11:22:56] <Whiskey> You see my fiddle it not working
[11:23:03] <Whiskey> it should be 3 lines espect last one
[11:23:09] <duch_kazatel> i don't see where you tried what i just gave you.
[11:25:39] <Whiskey> ok
[11:26:05] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/7/ it should be 4 lines and not 2
[11:26:18] <duch_kazatel> wut
[11:26:36] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[11:26:44] <Whiskey> lets make it easy for us
[11:26:48] <duch_kazatel> you're not being clear about something.
[11:26:54] <duch_kazatel> and you're making this really complicated.
[11:27:22] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/8/ thats the gool
[11:29:08] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:29:20] <duch_kazatel> this is a really overly complicated fiddle.
[11:29:30] <duch_kazatel> so clarify what you don't understand.
[11:30:25] <Whiskey> the 8 has 3 rows before the last one
[11:30:39] <Whiskey> The 7 have just 1 befroe the last one how do i make jQuery add two more
[11:31:27] <SleepySensei> Anyone ever export JSON out of a Google Spreadsheet? If so, I'm getting content grouping. Specifically, it's taking my first column and making a title key & value and then the rest of the columns are being lumped under the "content" key, as a comma separated value. What's up with that?
[11:32:00] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i literally just did http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aeyh1395/9/
[11:32:20] <Whiskey> yes but it don´t look the same as the first
[11:32:25] <Whiskey> you get the point?
[11:32:34] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey sure - that's html for you to add.
[11:32:39] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i'm not going to do it for you.
[11:32:44] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei that's the way google spreadsheets exports data?
[11:32:45] <Whiskey> $("table.FileInfo tbody tr:nth-child(-n03)").not(':last').after("\ <-- its that one i try to add two off
[11:33:05] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i have try whole day tto figure out why thas not work and google and try some other stuff
[11:33:15] <Whiskey> I can´t find out what i have to do
[11:33:31] <duch_kazatel> so you want the two new trs to look like the other ones?
[11:33:34] <duch_kazatel> then give them the same styles.
[11:33:37] <duch_kazatel> and html.
[11:33:38] <duch_kazatel> like..
[11:33:39] <Whiskey> yeh
[11:33:50] <duch_kazatel> pretty simple stuff.  looks like you have other cases where you did that already.
[11:34:40] <SleepySensei> dutch_kazatel: Bah Humbug. ‘Kay.
[11:34:50] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei i'm not sure what your question is.
[11:35:12] <duch_kazatel> they output data in a format - are you confused about why they chose that particular format?
[11:35:39] <Whiskey> No, i don´t get why it don´t add 2 new rows
[11:35:55] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i added 2 new rows in my last fiddle.  not sure where you're confused.
[11:36:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aeyh1395/9/ 2 new rows right here.
[11:36:20] <Whiskey> yes but not whit the style
[11:36:21] <SleepySensei> dutch_kazatel: Yeah, I queried the URL to output in JSON. But it's not necessarily nicely formated JSON
[11:36:28] <Whiskey> i try to add it above, But can´t make that code work
[11:36:50] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey it obviously functions - what isn't it doing that you need it to do?
[11:36:55] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i can do what you did to thats not the point
[11:37:05] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i do get that two, so what do i have to do to get it work=?
[11:37:10] <SleepySensei> dutch_kazatel: It's taking 4 columns and lumping them into one value in JSON, like this:
[11:37:10] <SleepySensei> $t: "name: (512) TWO, abv: 9, ibu: 99, style: Imperial or Double India Pale Ale"
[11:37:19] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei fyi you keep spelling my uname wrong ;)
[11:37:35] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey you need to clarify what you mean by "work"
[11:37:41] <Whiskey> fffs
[11:37:43] <duch_kazatel> do you mean "make the new rows look like the other rows?
[11:37:44] <Whiskey> what do you dont get
[11:38:40] <SleepySensei> And it's a string value nonetheless, making it harder to call for a particular piece of data. Like: ['name'] or ['abv']
[11:38:41] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/7/ <-- what i get --> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/8/ the i try to do
[11:38:48] <Whiskey> i allredy say that duch_kazatel
[11:38:51] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey...
[11:38:57] <duch_kazatel> i already explained what you need.
[11:39:13] <duch_kazatel> modify the html in $myNewContent to match the html in your other cases.
[11:39:14] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: Oh, lol sorry & thanks :)
[11:39:39] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei can you share an example of the data?
[11:39:40] <Whiskey> but the nth-child(-n03) should fix that for me
[11:39:43] <Whiskey> or its ony work whit td?
[11:39:59] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: Yeah, one sec.
[11:40:04] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey the way your markup is strictured has each rown in a... row.  so you need to replicate all the markup each time.
[11:40:24] <duch_kazatel> like... http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aeyh1395/10/
[11:42:04] <Whiskey> strange that it not work the way did
[11:42:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:42:58] <duch_kazatel> you mean that http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/7/ didn't work?
[11:43:02] <duch_kazatel> because that's not even valid js.
[11:44:35] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/13U6G0Hbrf0yyMDKUKJ63ZQWno4dWmj-LfnxuV7tnRjs/od6/public/basic?alt=json
[11:44:53] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: why won´t something like $("table.FileInfo").insertBefore($('tr').last())( work?
[11:45:04] <Whiskey> i mean its the same thing, only diffrent is you set it in a var
[11:45:08] <duch_kazatel> because that doesn't mean the same thing.
[11:45:28] <duch_kazatel> $("table.FileInfo").insertBefore($('tr').last()) will insert .FileInfo before the last TR.
[11:45:35] <duch_kazatel> which doesn't really make sense.
[11:46:22] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: but most be a way to do it as you did whit the var?
[11:46:44] <duch_kazatel> $someThing.insertBefore()
[11:46:55] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: Oh yeah, be aware that there's about 13,000+ objects in that JSON file
[11:47:06] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei that data seems pretty standard.
[11:47:14] <duch_kazatel> not seeing anything that screams "bad formatting"
[11:48:39] <duch_kazatel> you said something about quotes around keys - that's valid JSON.  in js you can use regular old dot notation to access those.
[11:48:58] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: no kidding
[11:49:04] <duch_kazatel> JSON is not javascript fwiw.
[11:49:05] <duch_kazatel> and yeah.
[11:49:06] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i get that but i don´t get it to work anyways. So what am i doing wonrg?
[11:49:17] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel Alright, I'll try it.
[11:49:21] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i gave you a working solution.
[11:49:27] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what else you're confused by.
[11:49:29] <Whiskey> yes
[11:49:39] <Whiskey> $("table.FileInfo tr").insertBefore($('tr').last())( but it has to be a way it can be done on my line two
[11:49:40] <duch_kazatel> fixingthesejquery.com <- Whiskey you should give this a read.
[11:49:43] <Whiskey> and not in a own variable
[11:49:58] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey uh, use the variable.  make your code readable.
[11:50:09] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, stick the string where that selector is right now.
[11:50:12] <duch_kazatel> and with that, lunch.
[11:50:13] <duch_kazatel> byeeee.
[11:50:18] <Whiskey> Well it won´t work in the end as i have more tables in my real code duckmaestro
[11:50:48] * duckmaestro quacks.
[11:51:01] <yottabyte> hey guys, this might be more of a JS question, but with jQuery I can do things like $('p').text("whateva").css("color", "red"), daisy chaining of sorts. Why is that?
[11:52:44] <shoky_> yottabyte: because those jquery methods return the "this" object, the reference back to the same jquery object
[11:53:07] <yottabyte> wow!
[11:53:25] <yottabyte> jquery is so good
[11:53:27] <yottabyte> is it here to stay?
[11:53:33] <yottabyte> will it integrate with javascript proper?
[11:54:02] <yottabyte> and what is that object design pattern called? it's got some name but I forgot
[11:54:02] <shoky_> javascript is a language.  jquery is just a library in that language.  no integration please
[11:54:13] <shoky_> it's called.. chaining, i guess
[11:55:03] <yottabyte> builder pattern!
[11:55:07] <yottabyte> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern
[11:55:32] <shoky_> uh, no
[11:57:24] <yottabyte> seems similar StreetMap map = new StreetMap.Builder(new Point(50, 50), new Point(100, 				100)).landColor(Color.GRAY).waterColor(Color.BLUE.brighter()) 				.build();
[11:58:13] <shoky_> that specific example happens to use chaining, yes. but the builder pattern has nothing to do with it
[12:00:38] <yottabyte> I see

[12:59:37] <ngharo> dopie: oh, remove the newline from your append string
[13:00:14] <ngharo> should be: $("main.story section article p:nth-child(3)").append("I am testing this");
[13:00:20] <dopie> ahhh itworked!
[13:00:21] <dopie> yay!
[13:02:06] <jost_> ngharo: no, I've read the docs, didn't find this specific information
[13:02:23] <ngharo> jost_: it's in here https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[13:02:33] <ngharo> "Callbacks can still be added to the resolved or rejected Deferred — they will execute immediately."

[14:14:17] <RockinAkin> does anyone know how I can apply a .css rule to multiple selectors assigned to variables?
[14:14:30] <duch_kazatel> RockinAkin need to use .add()
[14:15:09] <duch_kazatel> $thing1.add($thing2).css('display', 'none');
[14:15:40] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: Ah, duch, you're back. I am quite annoyed by Google Spreadsheet's JSON output of the data. I must be doing something wrong because it doesn't seem logical to group 4 columns of data into one string. Right?
[14:15:57] <RockinAkin> like if I have this:  https://jsfiddle.net/vv372jwf/
[14:15:59] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei could you show me an abbreviated version?
[14:16:09] <RockinAkin> i want to just do all of that in one line
[14:16:16] <RockinAkin> would .add() handle that?
[14:16:30] <duch_kazatel> RockinAkin https://api.jquery.com/add/ yep.
[14:16:50] <duch_kazatel> though that sounds like you want to add a class to a parent element they all share and target the style through that.
[14:17:02] <duch_kazatel> RockinAkin instead of using javascript.
[14:17:04] <usah> heyall
[14:17:13] <usah> im new to jquery and im trying to add a button
[14:17:20] <SleepySensei> When I call var content = dataSet[0]['content']['$t'];  It returns >> "name: (512) TWO, abv: 9, ibu: 99, style: Imperial or Double India Pale Ale"
[14:17:24] <usah> got <div id="output"></div> in html
[14:17:36] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei hey so an abbreviated copy of the data would be great.
[14:17:44] <usah> and within document ready i got this
[14:17:54] <SleepySensei> What do you mean by abbreviated?
[14:17:56] <duch_kazatel> usah make a fiddle instead of posting into the channel.
[14:18:04] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei not the thousands of rows from before?
[14:18:06] <usah> ok thanks
[14:18:11] <RockinAkin> duch_kazatel - they all have different things applied to them at different parts of the script, but in this specific part I just want to apply that one .css rule to them all in one go.
[14:18:23] <duch_kazatel> RockinAkin then .add() is what you want.
[14:18:33] <SleepySensei> k
[14:18:37] <duch_kazatel> RockinAkin though one-liners are hard to read.
[14:18:39] <duch_kazatel> sooo.

[14:20:09] <duch_kazatel> there is not paragraph in your example.

[14:21:40] <usah> thx for ur patience duch_kazatel
[14:21:50] <usah> there we go

[14:22:02] <usah> http://jsfiddle.net/9kk3zmLd/2/
[14:22:05] <duch_kazatel> so you want to append a button?
[14:22:06] <usah> :p
[14:22:13] <usah> yeah just wanna add a button
[14:22:13] <duch_kazatel> need to use something like .append() on the element.
[14:22:19] <usah> aha
[14:24:13] <duch_kazatel> SleepySensei i mean, depending that can seem kind of strange, but spreadsheet -> JSON is an awkward conversion anyway.,
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> so you're going to have weird compromises like that.
[14:24:43] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: I see
[14:26:27] <usah> tried this but not working
[14:26:29] <usah> http://jsfiddle.net/9kk3zmLd/3/
[14:26:37] <usah> got an exam soon and im fked lol
[14:26:41] <usah> would rly apprechiate some help
[14:26:46] <duch_kazatel> where did you get .button() from?
[14:26:53] <usah> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jqueryui/jqueryui_button.htm
[14:27:03] <duch_kazatel> that's jqueryui
[14:27:05] <duch_kazatel> not jquery
[14:27:08] <usah> ah ok
[14:27:16] <usah> well yeah im fucked ^
[14:27:26] <duch_kazatel> so do you know how to append html to an element using jquery?
[14:27:36] <duch_kazatel> also - p#buttons don't prepend IDs with the tagname.
[14:27:38] <usah> yeah i can figure that out
[14:27:51] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+append+button
[14:27:59] <duch_kazatel> pretty basic stuff :)
[14:28:05] <usah> thanks :)
[14:28:17] <usah> yeah im just rly lost i dont rly know where to start
[14:28:38] <duch_kazatel> what's the first result in that google search?
[14:29:05] <usah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18226598/how-to-add-a-button-dynamically-using-jquery
[14:29:34] <usah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16655997/using-jquery-append-to-add-a-button-to-a-form
[14:29:42] <usah> think 2nd one is more for what im lookin for right?
[14:29:43] <duch_kazatel> those each have different examples.
[14:30:00] <duch_kazatel> the second one is closer, but you need to .append()
[14:30:06] <usah> aiit
[14:30:13] <usah> thanks for ur patience :)
[14:30:21] <duch_kazatel> don't do $('.submit').after($('<input type="button" value="test">'));
[14:30:53] <usah> ok
[14:30:55] <duch_kazatel> the extra $() in the after() is overkill.  you could just do $('.submit').after('<input type="button" value="test">'); instead.  but you want to append.
[14:31:01] <usah> i should append '<input type="button" value="test">'
[14:31:04] <usah> something like that right
[14:31:15] <duch_kazatel> what do you think?
[14:31:15] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:31:32] <usah> yeah
[14:31:33] <usah> ^
[14:31:35] <usah> ^^
[14:32:17] <usah> ahhh
[14:32:20] <usah> now i understand somewhat
[14:32:26] <usah> i thought i was making some jquery button
[14:32:33] <usah> but im actually doing a html button through jquery
[14:32:35] <usah> ^^
[14:32:35] <duch_kazatel> what is the question you have?
[14:32:43] <usah> you alrdy answered it
[14:32:46] <usah> thanks
[14:32:48] <duch_kazatel> like, what were you instructed to do.
[14:32:59] <usah> i was instructed to first of all make a button
[14:33:02] <usah> and then some more stuff
[14:33:12] <usah> the other i can figure out but just got stuck at makin the button
[14:33:21] <duch_kazatel> well there you go then.
[14:33:25] <usah> thx!:)
[14:34:38] <usah> <duch_kazatel> also - p#buttons don't prepend IDs with the tagname.
[14:34:41] <usah> what do u mean by that?
[14:34:46] <duch_kazatel> just #buttons
[14:34:49] <usah> ah ok
[14:34:50] <usah> thx
[14:34:55] <duch_kazatel> never p#buttons or anything like that.
[14:35:10] <usah> just thought it was more specific
[14:35:19] <duch_kazatel> nope/.
[14:35:26] <duch_kazatel> to the selector system, the first one is slower.
[14:35:26] <usah> ait
[14:35:59] <duch_kazatel> the system collects all p tags, then looks for the one with the specific ID.  just giving the ID shortcuts to the browser's getElementById() method, which is wicked fast.
[14:36:30] <duch_kazatel> plus p#buttons is redundant - only one element can have that ID at a time anyway.
[14:37:05] <Vegitto> Hi. I have lots of data to post via AJAX. Is it safer to post it in multiple variables, or in one large variable? And is there a ready-made way to make sure the data is posted in full before I begin doing anything with it (apart from adding a special tag at the end)?
[14:37:10] <usah> omg it works!
[14:37:24] <usah> okay good to know, ty
[14:37:30] <usah> thx for the help, now i actually have a chance lol
[14:38:09] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto huh?  "safer"?
[14:38:24] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto if you're posting, go with whatever format is most readable.
[14:38:35] <duch_kazatel> and the .done() callback is what you want.
[14:38:48] <Vegitto> duch_kazatel: thanks
[14:39:21] <`ULT> hi!
[14:39:48] <Vegitto> duch_kazatel: I guess, to reformulate the question, what's the best way of posting an array so that I would be able to easily retrieve that array in PHP? Or do I have to decode + reincode it somehow?
[14:41:18] <Vegitto> reencode*
[14:41:56] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto as JSON, then let PHP/JS do the hard parts for encoding/decoding.
[14:44:34] <`ULT> Hi, maybe a very simple question: I need only the text in the label, and not the text in the span in the label: https://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/q4ke7bhv/
[14:44:39] <`ULT> How can i get that?
[14:44:54] <duch_kazatel> `ULT a couple different ways.
[14:44:57] <duch_kazatel> none of them enjoyable.
[14:45:15] <`ULT> aah, that sounds not realy good :p
[14:45:47] <duch_kazatel> the first way would to be to grab the first textnode of the label.  the other way would be to grab all the text and use .replace() to remove the stuff in the span.
[14:46:19] <usah> duch_kazatel: i cant thank u enough lol, now i got the ball rollin
[14:46:21] <`ULT> yes, was thinking on the second way.
[14:46:38] <usah> could do the rest but just diddnt know how to get it started lol.. been googling for an hour but diddnt know what i was lookin for
[14:46:40] <`ULT> not a realy clean way to do
[14:46:52] <duch_kazatel> `ULT yeah, they're both kind of gross.
[14:47:16] <`ULT> thanks for your suggestions.
[14:49:13] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/Lcekmw4h/ , what am i doing wrong in line 9?
[14:49:27] <adv_> i want to append the id of the anchor on click
[14:49:37] <duch_kazatel> adv_ woah what's with that if statement.
[14:50:13] <adv_> duch_kazatel: i want to append the text on first click and remove it if it's the 2nd time
[14:50:17] <adv_> like an on/off switch
[14:50:28] <duch_kazatel> adv_ that's not the right way to do what :)_
[14:50:31] <`ULT> hi duch_kazatel, what do you think of this way? http://viralpatel.net/blogs/jquery-get-text-element-without-child-element/
[14:50:40] <adv_> duch_kazatel: what do you suggest?
[14:50:43] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[14:51:11] <`ULT> clone, select, remove children and get
[14:52:10] <duch_kazatel> adv_ so when you click a link, you want to append the ID to the textarea?
[14:52:29] <adv_> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:55:08] <duch_kazatel> sorry one sec.
[14:55:12] <duch_kazatel> busy day :)_
[14:55:49] <duch_kazatel> and you only want to add the id if it doesn't yet exist?
[14:55:59] <duch_kazatel> are you going to separate them by ID or anything like that?
[14:56:07] <duch_kazatel> err, by comma
[14:56:28] <adv_> yes by comma
[14:56:57] <adv_> and yes to the other question
[14:57:01] <duch_kazatel> alright, one sec.
[15:08:06] <duch_kazatel> adv_ sorry about that http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lcekmw4h/1/
[15:08:42] <duch_kazatel> minor qurikk, but you get the idea.
[15:09:17] <duch_kazatel> ditch the hellow world: and you're golden.  or just clean up that first comma after the .joinb()
[15:09:20] <duch_kazatel> *join
[15:10:05] <adv_> duch_kazatel: thanks! yeah first comma is not a problem
[15:10:10] <duch_kazatel> get the idea?
[15:10:16] <duch_kazatel> manipulate the array, not text.
[15:10:26] <adv_> but why was the on/off thing bad?
[15:10:30] <duch_kazatel> also, your if statement didn't make any sense.  that would conditionally bind the listener, not conditionally run logic.
[15:10:48] <adv_> so inside the if i add the css fading and in the else i undo it , correct?
[15:11:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:12:12] <duch_kazatel> if you need to do other stuff, yes.
[15:12:50] <adv_> duch_kazatel: so my if statement would work but it's bad practice?
[15:13:02] <duch_kazatel> adv_ err, no.
[15:13:07] <duch_kazatel> that would have only run on pageload.
[15:13:12] <duch_kazatel> not every time you clicked a link.
[15:13:21] <duch_kazatel> since the if was for binding the event listeners, not running logic.
[15:13:49] <adv_> why? i had inside the if/else toggle = "1"
[15:13:59] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't matter.  it was around the event bindings.
[15:14:23] <duch_kazatel> $('a').on('click', function() {}); is a binding.
[15:14:38] <duch_kazatel> all it does is tell the page "run this code when the link is clicked"
[15:14:51] <adv_> yes
[15:14:54] <duch_kazatel> that part doesn't get re-run unless you tell it to - the if statement doesn't re-run when the value of a variable changes.
[15:15:06] <duch_kazatel> in your case, the if ran, the event was bound, and that was it.
[15:15:07] <adv_> so when it was linked it would figure out if it's already in or out
[15:15:13] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:15:30] <adv_> but i was doing on or off when it got added/removed
[15:15:41] <duch_kazatel> when were you running the if?
[15:15:58] <duch_kazatel> and on/off is an antipattern.  use delegated listeners or just hide/show things.
[15:17:23] <duch_kazatel> to simplify: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v5hssdvm/
[15:17:35] <duch_kazatel> even though I change the "n", the else never runs.
[15:19:57] <hrusti> duch_kazatel: you want to run else when you click to link second time?
[15:20:09] <duch_kazatel> hrusti lol reread the convo ;)
[15:20:21] <hrusti> tl;dr :)
[15:20:23] <duch_kazatel> i was explaining how it works.
[15:20:28] <duch_kazatel> not asking for help.
[15:20:31] <hrusti> aha
[15:20:33] <hrusti> ok
[15:20:33] <hrusti> sry
[15:29:04] <adv_> duch_kazatel: hm
[15:29:18] <adv_> weird. i don't know how that doesn't work but you made your point
[15:29:20] <adv_> thanks
[15:31:36] <duch_kazatel> adv_ you're seeing the functions, not the bindings.
[15:32:06] <adv_> lol that sounded like yoda
[15:32:37] <duch_kazatel> $('a').on('click', function() {}); just binds a function.  the code inside the function is "static", if that makes sens.e
[15:34:18] <adv_> yes
[15:34:20] <adv_> thanks
[15:57:51] <Vegitto> Hi. I'm sending an array through ajax, and it works fine, except it only seems to send the first 249 items.
[15:58:02] <duch_kazatel> O.o
[15:58:06] <duch_kazatel> how are you sending it?
[15:58:20] <Vegitto>   $.ajax({   type: 'POST',   url: 'update.php',   data: { content: content }   })        .done(function() {      alert('Sent!');      });
[15:58:30] <Vegitto> I do get the alert.
[15:58:46] <duch_kazatel> 249 seems... excessive.
[15:59:01] <Vegitto> What do you mean?
[15:59:15] <duch_kazatel> you have an array of over 249 items that you're trying to post?
[15:59:19] <SleepySensei> duch_kazatel: Hey, just in case you were wondering if and how I solved my problem: I just used a CSV to JSON script on a CSV file that Google Spreadsheets updates everytime there's a change. So the server converts the data and then it's accessible in a MUCH cleaner format. Thanks for your input along the way.
[15:59:31] <Vegitto> Yes. I think so.
[15:59:40] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto why so much data?
[15:59:58] <Vegitto> Actually, it's not all that much, as each element of the array is just a couple of words.
[16:00:38] <Vegitto> Is there a way I could print_f the array before sending it?
[16:00:40] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto is your network tab only reporting that amount?  or is it the server?
[16:00:48] <duch_kazatel> use your network tab to inspect the request./
[16:01:13] <Vegitto> Ok. I'm using Safari, not sure I have that.
[16:01:21] <duch_kazatel> safari has developer tools.
[16:01:29] <duch_kazatel> though i'd suggest chrome or ff over safari.
[16:01:39] <duch_kazatel> fixingthesejquery.com has a good overview of those tools.
[16:02:15] <Vegitto> Ok, looks like it's a PHP issue. Unknown: Input variables exceeded 1000. To increase the limit change max_input_vars in php.ini. in <b>Unknown</b> on line <b>0</b><br />
[16:02:22] <duch_kazatel> there you go :)
[16:02:48] <Vegitto> Is there an easy way I could split the array?
[16:03:07] <duch_kazatel> not efficiently.  i would be really worried that you're sending over an array that large.
[16:03:10] <duch_kazatel> why is the array that big?
[16:04:21] <Vegitto> How is 249 values big?
[16:04:39] <duch_kazatel> that's a lot of data to send in a post.
[16:04:51] <duch_kazatel> your php is complaining about over 1000
[16:04:53] <Vegitto> It's a text editing tool. And it needs to resend the text.
[16:05:00] <usah> $('p:first').css('font-size', '18px');
[16:05:05] <Vegitto> Yup, I don't know why that is, because it caps it at 249. :)
[16:05:06] <usah> is there anything wrong with this line?
[16:05:22] <Vegitto> duch_kazatel: Is there a better way to send the data other than post?
[16:05:30] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto so it's not an array of 1000 items - you need to send a string.
[16:05:54] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto that'll get you the first p tag on the page.
[16:05:58] <duch_kazatel> err, usah ^
[16:06:36] <Vegitto> duch_kazatel: it's not that simple, unfortunately
[16:06:38] <usah> ye?
[16:06:48] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto wat
[16:06:52] <duch_kazatel> it's a string.
[16:07:20] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto unless it's sending over a string as an array of chars.  but that seems... off.
[16:07:21] <Vegitto> duch_kazatel: the text is not stored in p tags, and many words have comments attached to them, or footnotes, thus each word is stored in a separate array
[16:07:34] <duch_kazatel> Vegitto i mistakenly tagged you for that one.
[16:07:55] <duch_kazatel> the p tag thing was meant for usah, and that's a really strange way to store data.
[16:08:02] <usah> yeah i know
[16:08:03] <Vegitto> oh
[16:08:16] <usah> this is beginner practice excercises
[16:08:24] <usah> its not for pro project :p
[16:08:39] <usah> but is there anything about it that shouldnt work?
[16:09:04] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:09:05] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:09:08] <usah> hmm ait
[16:09:36] <usah> http://jsfiddle.net/9kk3zmLd/6/
[16:09:54] <usah> i know the code is shit but im just tryin to get it to work, its beginning of the course so were just supposed to pass
[16:10:19] <usah> my friend helped me a bit earlier, the excercises are retarded from a coder point of view.
[16:10:48] <usah> font size wont change on first <p>
[16:11:13] <duch_kazatel> hey so that word isn't okay.
[16:11:22] <duch_kazatel> thanks!
[16:11:38] <duch_kazatel> and your issue is $('butt3').click(function() {
[16:11:44] <duch_kazatel> there is no element called "butt3"
[16:11:48] <usah> alright
[16:11:48] <duch_kazatel> i think you mean #butt3
[16:11:49] <usah> ahh yeah
[16:11:51] <usah> thanks man
[16:13:29] <adv_> duch_kazatel: this.css("opacity", "0.5"); , why won't that work?
[16:13:40] <duch_kazatel> open your console - any errors?
[16:13:45] <adv_> yes
[16:13:52] <duch_kazatel> aaaand what are they?
[16:13:54] <adv_> this.css is not a function
[16:14:03] <duch_kazatel> are you in an event handler?
[16:14:09] <adv_> in the if
[16:14:14] <adv_> of that code
[16:14:17] <duch_kazatel> within the event handler?
[16:14:20] <adv_> yes
[16:14:29] <duch_kazatel> so `this` refers to the DOM element.
[16:14:33] <duch_kazatel> not to the jquery object.
[16:14:36] <duch_kazatel> you likely want $(this)
[16:14:47] <adv_> ah let me try
[16:15:11] <adv_> worked, thanks
[16:15:19] <duch_kazatel> understand the distinction.
[16:17:18] <adv_> yeah got it
[16:39:40] <usah> http://jsfiddle.net/9kk3zmLd/7/
[16:39:49] <usah> u have any ideas why the last two buttons alerts doesnt work?
[16:40:15] <usah> even checked the solution the code seems right
[16:40:19] <usah> maybe its my browsers
[16:41:46] <RockinAkin> works for me?
[16:41:50] <usah> okay cool
[16:41:54] <usah> thx :)
[16:41:58] <usah> thought it was right
[16:42:47] <RockinAkin> on chrome if it helps
[16:43:20] <usah> aiit
[16:43:28] <usah> time to get chrome aswell then ^^
[16:44:24] <duch_kazatel> don't use alert btw.
[16:44:38] <duch_kazatel> and the html in jsfiddle should only have your stuff in <body>

[16:45:56] <avidaicu> Hi all
[16:45:57] <usah> doesnt work on chromium either
[16:46:01] <usah> but doesnt matter at all :p
[16:46:30] <avidaicu> Inside each <li> when <i> is clicked it expands and collapses the <ul> that follows. Need to make it so that once another <i> is clicked it collapses the previous <ul>. See fiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/zb2eu19g/5/
[16:46:49] <avidaicu> Any help much appreciated!
[16:49:26] <avidaicu> any ideas?
[16:53:50] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[16:54:09] <duch_kazatel> add an "open" class and then select on that to hide the others.
[16:54:24] <cliffer> my onscroll event is apparently fired before a previously fired one is finished? how to prevent this? let the function unbind itself from scroll event on start and re-attach it on end?
[16:54:53] <duch_kazatel> no - use a debounce
[16:55:04] <duch_kazatel> you want it to wait until you're done scrolling.
[16:55:18] <duch_kazatel> unless it's a different handler./
[16:55:23] <duch_kazatel> cliffer ^
[16:55:44] <cliffer> ok, no idea what a debounce is, but thx, i will check it
[16:56:04] <duch_kazatel> http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function for one of many options.
[16:56:09] <avidaicu> duch_kazatel: you mean add the "open" on the <li>?
[16:56:14] <duch_kazatel> avidaicu did you see my suggestions?
[16:56:14] <cliffer> first google entry :)
[16:56:38] <duch_kazatel> avidaicu yes.
[16:58:05] <avidaicu> duch_kazatel I don't quiet understand what you mean
[16:58:59] <cliffer> duch_kazatel: mhh, i implemented something like this by myself for another function. i thought there is perhaps something nicer :)
[16:59:13] <duch_kazatel> cliffer this is the "nicer" solution :)
[16:59:28] <avidaicu> was the debounce function for me?
[16:59:36] <duch_kazatel> avidaicu no.  one sec.
[17:00:18] <avidaicu> thanks
[17:00:26] <duch_kazatel> avidaicu for the basic gist; https://jsfiddle.net/zb2eu19g/9/
[17:00:35] <duch_kazatel> needs a new conditional to handle clicking on the current one.
[17:01:01] <cliffer> duch_kazatel: like $(window).scroll(func, 250, true)
[17:01:09] <duch_kazatel> cliffer nope.
[17:01:15] <duch_kazatel> nothing really built in last i checked.
[17:01:59] <avidaicu> thank you, although if you click on the current one now it's not working correctly
[17:02:02] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:02:07] <duch_kazatel> hence the extra conditional ;)
[17:02:23] <avidaicu> it doesn't collapse
[17:02:27] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:02:40] <cannap> watch me suck at js when you have time https://www.livecoding.tv/cannap/
[17:04:03] <avidaicu> hmm
[17:07:34] <avidaicu> duch_kazatel can we not use the conditional in this case?
[17:07:41] <duch_kazatel> you use it, just differently.
[17:08:01] <duch_kazatel> giving you some inspiration to split the problem in a slightly different way.
[17:09:23] <duch_kazatel> avidaicu here, have a freebie: https://jsfiddle.net/zb2eu19g/12/
[17:09:39] <avidaicu> stuck with this one
[17:11:03] <avidaicu> it's ok,I'll check it out
[17:11:11] <avidaicu> thank you so much duch_k
[17:28:46] <cliffer> duch_kazatel: i implemented it debounce. now, if i set the intervall the 10 ms, it works pretty well, but on 250 it doesnt work? isnt it supposed to be the oposite?
[17:29:47] <duch_kazatel> it waits 250 ms before firing the handler.
[17:30:04] <duch_kazatel> should be fine otherwise.
[17:30:19] <duch_kazatel> *250ms after the last time it fired.
[17:32:28] <cliffer> i use scrolltop. on fast firing (10), it gives increaes/decreases constantly. on slow firing (250), it jumps like on scrolling down: 212 - 268 - 212
[17:32:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:32:39] <duch_kazatel> what is this for?
[17:32:46] <duch_kazatel> show me your code in a fiddle ;)
[17:33:28] <cliffer> i can create a fiddle later
[17:33:37] <duch_kazatel> i'm leaving in a few minutes.
[17:33:54] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you might be confused about what's going on - so what was the original problem?
[17:34:01] <cliffer> yo need a small browser window in height to have something to scroll
[17:35:12] <cliffer> the jumping was the original problem. so it implemented debounce to prevent scroll firing if the last one isnt finished. but it only solves the problem on small pauses like 10msec
[17:35:19] <duch_kazatel> "jumping?
[17:35:44] <cliffer> small height of browser window, than scroll down
[17:35:51] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to open your page fwiw.
[17:35:56] <cliffer> ok :)
[17:36:01] <duch_kazatel> if you can't share it in the channel, i don't want to see it ;)

[17:36:32] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to make a sticky header?
[17:36:44] <cliffer> yes
[17:36:49] <duch_kazatel> use css for that.
[17:36:51] <duch_kazatel> position: fixed;
[17:37:17] <cliffer> the header should stick if the picture is scrolled away
[17:37:35] <duch_kazatel> then use something like http://stickyjs.com/
[17:37:45] <duch_kazatel> because what you're doing now won't work out long term.
[17:39:16] <cliffer> ok th

[19:06:10] <fas3r> hello
[19:54:14] <dumptruckman> hey all
[19:55:19] <dumptruckman> i'm trying to figure out a way to have a list of objects with another object that reference elements of the first list. all this is stored in webstorage
[19:56:04] <dumptruckman> i'm not super familiar with JS but it seems that if i put one of the list elements in another object it stores it by value rather than reference
[19:56:15] <dumptruckman> or perhaps this is a side effect of web storage
[20:04:10] <PurePandemonium> dumptruckman: are your elements primitives?
[20:05:06] <dumptruckman> negative
[20:06:47] <dumptruckman> so, ArrayA : [Object1, Object2, Object3], ObjectB : { objectList : [Object1, Object3]}
[20:06:52] <dumptruckman> i want changes to ObjectB.objectList[0] to affect the object in ArrayA[0]
[20:07:05] <dumptruckman> and continue to do so after going in and out of web storage
[20:11:18] <dumptruckman> my java experience tells me this would work until it passes through serialization... but js seems to handle "serialization" better
[20:12:34] <PurePandemonium> I think you would need to reconstruct your ObjectB.objectList after loading from webstorage
[20:14:04] <PurePandemonium> I typically "serialize" js data with something like localStorage['saveFile'] = btoa(JSON.stringify(saveData));
[20:15:12] <PurePandemonium> failing that, I would save references as IDs instead, and access them using that ID when you want to make changes
[20:15:31] <PurePandemonium> Saving to webstorage would preserve the ID and behaviour shouldn't change
[20:16:59] <PurePandemonium> dumptruckman: ##javascript is a little more active, and might have a better answer than I can provide.
[20:18:26] <dumptruckman> yeah, through appery.io i don't know exactly what the web storage implementation is like but it definitely seems like it's just converting to/from json
[20:21:08] <dumptruckman> i figured IDs were what i would need
[20:21:20] <dumptruckman> just complicates this other part all to hell
[20:22:21] <PurePandemonium> I think that's typical, and JSON will only store raw data, and webstorage is fairly dumb.
[20:33:33] <grunty> Hi, all - I've got an issue with .done not firing ... my code, simplified looks like, $.when( $.ajax( ... ) ).done( alert( "done!" ) ); // does anyone see what may be causing it, or is it likely because of a specific issue with my code that I haven't revealed?
[20:44:05] <PurePandemonium> at first glance, maybe wrap your callback. So ...done(function(){alert("done!") })
[20:45:35] <grunty> PurePandemonium, oh. Yah I forgot to include that in my example.
[20:47:08] <grunty> So, yah: $.when( $.ajax( ... ) ).done( function(){ alert( "done!" ) } );
[20:48:46] <PurePandemonium> assuming the ajax resolves, that ought to work
[20:49:27] <grunty> I mean, I have a success call to a function: $.when( $.ajax( url:myurl, success:myfunct(result){populate(result), datatype:'html'} ) ).done( function(){ alert( "done!" ) } );
[20:50:04] <grunty> And it does resolve --- myfunct() does everything it should.
[21:02:05] <PurePandemonium> grunty: I'm doing some tinkering, but I can't get $.when(ajax).done() to do anything useful.
[21:02:33] <PurePandemonium> I'm pretty good with jquery, but ajax isn't my strong point.
[21:09:24] <PurePandemonium> grunty: This is modified from someone else's ajax test. Seems to work OK http://jsfiddle.net/nty2js2a/
[21:23:55] <grunty> PurePandemonium, yah. That's ... what code looks like. Ah well - the .done part is only informative, anyway.
[23:25:15] <pokergod> I'm using dragtable. If the table is restored, the data being inserted into the table dynamically will go in the wrong columns.  How would you handle this?  When going to insert the data, figure out the column positions and insert?   When dragging of a column starts, prevent inserting into the table and buffer the results until the enddrag event is called and then insert into the table accordingly?
