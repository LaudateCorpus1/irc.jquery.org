[00:59:41] <sonu_nk> Hi, i am searching for a form builder which can provide me 3-4 template and in that template i can design my own form. do you know any paid plugin like that ?
[03:03:07] <Assault> hi
[03:04:04] <Assault> I can animate an element to move left by  $("#myElementId").animate({left: '250px'});, but is there a way to make element rotate continuously?
[03:04:23] <Assault> I want to make a spinner for a "loading" animation
[03:11:20] <IamTrying> Chrome Web Store - i have EDITED my screen sharing app. But while installing it keeps showing still the OLD version. Is it a manual job from Google web store team? or managed by Chromium contributors?

[03:24:27] <printForever> guys_
[06:24:20] <cp> hi guys
[06:24:36] <cp> how do you put css on a object you have found
[06:26:00] <cp> for example elements = $('#element').find('li'); elements.css('background-color', 'red');
[06:26:36] <cp> this doesn't seem to be working
[06:29:30] <Cork> cp: that should work as long as the $().find actually finds any elements
[06:29:40] <Cork> check with console.log(elements.length)
[06:44:30] <harry_> how do i slide an element to from left to right?
[07:07:48] <Cork> harry_: absolute or relative position the element and animate the left position
[07:08:25] <Cork> alternatively you can animate by using the scroll of the parent
[07:08:30] <Cork> depending on what you need to do
[07:10:02] <harry_> Cork: i want the image to come of the screen and another image to appear in its place
[07:10:34] <Cork> harry_: you could use background-position and multiple background images
[07:10:52] <Cork> and do the animation with css transition or @keyframe
[07:11:18] <harry_> would i just need to add the class on click?
[07:11:26] <Cork> yup
[07:11:37] <harry_> thank
[07:11:40] <harry_> you
[07:39:29] <dglambert> morning
[09:03:15] <cp_> hey guys
[09:03:38] <cp_> does anyone know how to drag a whole list of classes at the same time
[09:04:56] <cp_> $('.classname').draggable() is putting a draggable on every element with .classname
[09:05:09] <cp_> but i want them to move as one
[09:08:53] <cp_> ?

[09:24:44] <Duikb00t> Hmm what thing am I missing im trying to generate a AJAX File upload: http://kopy.io/mQnKc
[09:38:41] <Duikb00t> found it
[09:38:43] <Duikb00t> it was a typoe
[10:21:42] <jcjq> Good morning, I have this simple script https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/5/ I want it to select all of the options under the <optgroups>  when the matching option is chosen in the first form. It kind of works but only a single <optgroup>'s options can be selected at a time (seemingly) what am I missing?
[10:23:06] <Cork> jcjq: firstly, use event handlers not event attributes
[10:23:27] <Cork> secondly, you need to grab app the :selected options in the current select element
[10:23:47] <Cork> and then find the child option of all those optgroup in the other select
[10:23:54] <Cork> and set all of them to selected
[10:24:00] <Cork> that would give you the effect you're after
[10:24:31] <jcjq> Cork: thanks for responding - what are your specifically referring to what the event handler not event attribute?
[10:24:51] <Cork> <elm on<event>="script"> <-- event attribute
[10:25:10] <Cork> $('target').on('event', function(event) {}) <-- event handler
[10:25:17] <codecutter> error is on line 22 : http://pastebin.com/uNtenrYv
[10:25:48] <jcjq> Cork: Ok I see. not sure I understand the difference. I'll have to read about that
[10:25:57] <codecutter> line 22 refers to line 31 in pastebin
[10:26:01] <Cork> codecutter: you would have to reference the correct line offset for the code
[10:26:03] <Cork> ah
[10:26:27] <Cork> codecutter: the engine you're using doesn't support fat arrows
[10:26:48] <Cork> you need to use function(a) { return ;}
[10:27:37] <Cork> jcjq: basically event attributes was added back in the mid 90's
[10:28:14] <Cork> and isn't assailable (you can ever only have one per element and so on), and it plays badly with the much more modern event handler structure
[10:28:25] <codecutter> data.map(function(a){return [a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4]])?
[10:28:37] <Cork> ]})
[10:28:50] <Cork> don't forget to close the function block
[10:29:13] <jcjq> Cork: I started using that because I wrote a fairly extensive SPA using a bunch of ajax calls and I had lots of overlapping event handler definitions. Perhaps I need to rethink the structure of my front-end all together
[10:29:46] <Cork> jcjq: what you want to do to make code maintainable is to separate js from html
[10:30:01] <Cork> keep js in a separate file and have it control the html from selectors
[10:30:09] <Cork> it becomes MUCH easier to maintain in the long run
[10:30:19] <Cork> (also if you ever want to enable csp you HAVE to)
[10:30:35] <codecutter> Cork: and line 48
[10:30:45] <Cork> as on<event>="" requires eval
[10:31:23] <jcjq> Cork: I've done that, however, I think by definitions were too general for many of the event handlers.
[10:31:27] <Cork> codecutter: ya, not even sure what you're trying to do there
[10:31:31] <jcjq> my definitions*
[10:32:10] <Cork> jcjq: and cause of that you have to use event attributes??, sorry i don't follow...
[10:32:10] <codecutter> Cork: its noy my code, belongs to someone over at highcharts.com, who posted in their forum
[10:32:17] <codecutter> not*
[10:32:26] <codecutter> posted it*
[10:32:49] <Cork> wonder if that is meant to be load(() => {
[10:32:59] <Cork> donno though, just guessing
[10:33:09] <jcjq> Cork: well I switched over to having a js library for each "page" or portion of the app and wrote specific event functions for each form or button on those pages
[10:33:15] <Cork> anyway that code doesn't parse so can't say what it is meant to do
[10:33:35] <codecutter> here is the actual error http://pastebin.com/Uw23e0pm
[10:33:41] <Cork> jcjq: sure, that doesn't mean attributes though
[10:34:16] <Cork> ya, doesn't say me anything
[10:34:29] <Cork> prob cause the structure is just plain broken
[10:34:34] <codecutter> nvm
[10:34:49] <jcjq> Cork: yeah I guess I didn't realize that the attribute method was out of date. I'm still pretty much a newb with js/jquery even though I'm developing this really in depth app
[10:35:20] <Cork> jcjq: either load a separate js file for each page and have it define the event handlers in there
[10:35:46] <Cork> jcjq: or you can define the handlers in functions that is called from one file based on a class or ref you set in the page
[10:35:53] <Cork> (the later is what i do)
[10:37:55] <jcjq> Cork: Perhaps I should read over some JS concept stuff and refresh my basics. Can you recommend any solid resources that would provide a thorough overview?
[10:38:39] <jcjq> Cork: I feel a bit silly for going this far. I've written thousands of lines of code for this app and I'm basically learning as I go ha
[10:39:41] <codecutter> Cork: familiar with highcharts library?
[10:39:41] <codecutter> http://www.highcharts.com/
[10:39:56] <Cork> codecutter: used it a bit, but not much
[10:40:46] <codecutter> #highcharts is so slow to respond. I may need to highlight your name with random question for a while.
[10:41:37] <Cork> jcjq: can't say i can remember one of the top of my head
[10:41:51] <Cork> at least not one i know talk about how you should structure a document
[10:43:22] <codecutter> Cork: how would i create something like this with highcharts? http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=bf3a633
[10:46:48] <quechon> im using autosize http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/ but when i use it it changes my textarea layout how can i set my own css thanks
[10:50:11] <jcjq> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/7/ this so I feel like my code is close, but still not working.
[11:03:38] <iCode> j nodejs
[12:59:11] <Terens> hello
[12:59:28] <Terens> would you use server rendered html ?
[12:59:34] <Terens> or js template? for polling
[13:00:35] <robertmaxrees> "polling"?
[13:00:58] <Terens> short polling
[13:01:12] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:01:15] <robertmaxrees> ship over json.
[13:01:18] <robertmaxrees> render client-side.
[13:01:58] <Terens> I did that and lead dev got really pissed off
[13:02:17] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> context is important here.
[13:02:25] <Terens> Because it is overcomplexity
[13:02:46] <Terens> and that I introduced eg handlebars
[13:03:20] <Terens> and that is doing things other way causing confusion
[13:03:35] <Terens> but it is like 300 fields
[13:03:35] <robertmaxrees> is the convention in your codebase to send html?
[13:04:33] <Terens> some parts are, or change it with jquery manually $(".that).text(blah)...
[13:04:48] <Terens> but this was a new component
[13:04:52] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[13:05:16] <sloft> how did he get really pissed of? did you waste to much time? did you insist on your solution?
[13:05:20] <robertmaxrees> if there's an established pattern, follow it.  changing the way you do it in one place makes developer productivity.
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> *super low
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> follow the convention and suggest your alternative as a separate thing.
[13:07:15] <Terens> no I didnt waste time but rendering html would be too much data but might not make any noticable difference actually
[13:07:26] <Terens> ok robertmaxrees
[13:07:49] <robertmaxrees> like, i know it seems stupid, but bucking convention like that is kind of a bad idea.
[13:52:51] <jcjq> Can anyone explain why this script does not select child options of multiple optgroup's? https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/7/ - Thank You
[14:14:40] <bigLanky> can someone take a look at https://jsfiddle.net/qukkrkvx/ ? I am trying to set a checkbox so that when checked, it disables the input fields in the table row
[14:15:13] <bigLanky> this works unless you select multiple, and then try to uncheck them
[14:15:21] <bigLanky> 1 by 1 works on all
[14:33:30] <robertmaxrees> bigLanky hrm.
[14:34:08] <bigLanky> toggle 1 on, toggle it off, no problem... toggle 2 on then try to toggle 1 off, depending which one, it works, but then 1 will always get stuck
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  looking at it.
[14:34:29] <bigLanky> i dont see why they are even crossing over as the highest my JS goes is the <tr> element
[14:35:03] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:35:07] <robertmaxrees> if ($('.unable_to_test').is(':checked')) { - this is all of them.
[14:35:20] <robertmaxrees> not making it relative tothe current one.
[14:35:38] <bigLanky> so do I need to add .unable_to_test.each() before my if statement?
[14:36:00] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[14:36:02] <robertmaxrees> just use $(this)
[14:36:04] <robertmaxrees> also:
[14:36:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qukkrkvx/1/
[14:37:06] <robertmaxrees> no need for most of the code you were using when checking/unchecking
[14:37:16] <bigLanky> ah nice yeah a lot cleaner
[14:37:17] <bigLanky> thanks
[14:37:26] <robertmaxrees> but get the thing about $(this)
[14:37:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:37:34] <bigLanky> yeah
[14:37:40] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:38:40] <bigLanky> yep, that works perfect
[14:45:15] <bigLanky> robertmaxrees: what about this one? https://jsfiddle.net/qukkrkvx/3/
[14:45:25] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[14:45:29] <bigLanky> I have added class required to the first transaction ID input field... trying to get that to toggle
[14:45:57] <bigLanky> it is on by default... when I click the checkbox, it disables, but keeps the class... then when I unheck the box, it enables the fields but then removes the required class
[14:46:09] <bigLanky> the first click to enable checkbox isn't toggling the class
[14:46:14] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to be the inverse of the checkbox?
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> oor....?
[14:46:34] <bigLanky> so when checkbox gets checked, the field needs to be disabled and also remove class 'required'
[14:46:50] <bigLanky> ah, im dumb
[14:46:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want it to be the inverse of the checkbox status :)
[14:46:59] <bigLanky> just realized that it is only performing that if checked
[14:47:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qukkrkvx/4/
[14:47:25] <bigLanky> awesome
[15:09:25] <gambl0re> how would i a regex that would remove all punctuation from a string and replace all white space with a "+" for example. "zion.t" => zion+t or "yo, whats up!" => "yo+whats+up"
[15:52:25] <Toaster> Is there any wiki of project how to start contributing? I can't find any unfortunately
[15:54:20] <Toaster> Thanks,I have found finally!
[15:54:56] <hlve> ...who are you thanking :o
[15:56:55] <Toaster> Myself xD
[16:30:13] <Elles> hello I have an option in select defined this way <option value="empty"></option> + other options, after doing stuff with selected option in script I want to select back the empty value tho $("#select_id").val("empty"); doesnt work Im on jquery 3.1.0
[16:31:09] <robertmaxrees> gitta fiddle?
[16:31:12] <robertmaxrees> *gotta
[16:32:06] <robertmaxrees> Elles because - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46x9w19x/
[16:32:09] <robertmaxrees> this uses 3.1.0
[16:34:46] <sttre> InStr() is a King.
[16:34:52] <Elles> robertmaxrees it works
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> sttre cool?
[16:35:10] <robertmaxrees> Elles so what's the issue?
[16:35:14] <Elles> I mean my version on jsfiddle yet not in my code
[16:35:26] <Elles> https://jsfiddle.net/46x9w19x/1/
[16:35:27] <robertmaxrees> Elles so check your console on your site.
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> any errors>?
[16:36:12] <sttre> not cool.
[16:36:45] <robertmaxrees> sttre uh, okay?
[16:36:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:36:48] <robertmaxrees> so lost.
[16:40:41] <hlve> InSttre() is my fav tho
[16:46:21] <Ownix> I have I have an element like `var myElement = document.getElementById('myElement');` when I use jQuery to do this `$(myElement)` is that querying the DOM still?
[16:46:24] <Elles> no no errors I think, I must have someting messed up
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> why not just do $('#myElement') ?
[16:47:52] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: because this question is hypothetically asking how jquery handles an existing element. If you must know my real use case is AngularJS related with link(scope, element <-- ...
[16:48:23] <Ownix> I just need to know if jQuery is using the data from the element to hit the DOM again and re-pull the element. Of if it just "converts" it to a jQuery style object.
[16:48:49] <robertmaxrees> it generates a new jquery object with the node you gave it.
[16:48:56] <robertmaxrees> afaik it's not hitting the document again
[16:51:56] <Ownix> ty
[16:52:16] <robertmaxrees> could check the source and see what that says.
[16:53:05] <Elles> maybe the error has something to do with materialize
[16:53:26] <robertmaxrees> Elles could be.  did you recently upgrade to jquery 3.1 ?
[16:53:42] <Elles> no Im a newbie and I started with 3.1
[16:54:01] <Ownix> Now for a really stupid question, is this a bad convention? var $target = $(target);
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> Ownix depends.
[16:54:17] <Ownix> Should I do `targetElement` instead of `$target`?
[16:54:30] <robertmaxrees> why not just pass in a jquery object to begin with?
[16:54:53] <Ownix> I cant, Angular/Dragula whatever crazy library gjust gives me the element
[16:55:57] <Elles> robertmaxrees problem fixed
[16:56:18] <Elles> thanks for elaborating that helped me to find the issue
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> Ownix alright.
[17:00:50] <robertmaxrees> then just roll with what you've got.
[17:01:03] <robertmaxrees> not terribly dissimilar from the $this = $(this) thing.
[17:05:35] <frostythesnowman> hi, i'm trying to prevent my form from submitting by pasting the following into my JS console "$('form').on('submit',function(e){e.preventDefault();});".  However, it still submits when i hit the button element inside the form.
[17:05:57] <frostythesnowman> does anyone know what's wrong with that command? i've confirmed that the binded function is being called by inserting an alert
[17:07:13] <frostythesnowman> i've also tried returning false instead of using preventDefault to no avail
[17:12:42] <frostythesnowman> anyone? :\
[17:12:53] <robertmaxrees> frostythesnowman just saw this.
[17:13:00] <robertmaxrees> are there any other handlers on it?
[17:14:14] <robertmaxrees> i ask because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n2tdoras/
[17:14:19] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what you'd want to do.
[17:16:15] <frostythesnowman> robertmaxrees: hi! so the basic syntax i'm using seems to be the same.  i'm not sure at the moment if there are other handlers.  is there an easy way to check in the JS console what events are bound?
[17:16:45] <robertmaxrees> *handlers, not events.  and maybekindasorta?
[17:16:52] <robertmaxrees> is this on your own site?
[17:18:19] <frostythesnowman> ya, i'm one of many project contributors though
[17:18:50] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like you might want to dig around and see what else is bound in your codebase.
[17:18:52] <frostythesnowman> i'm currently trying to decipher ​$._data( $("#form")[0], "events" );
[17:18:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:18:59] <robertmaxrees> anything in there?
[17:20:24] <frostythesnowman> ok, will take a look. and, i'd be looking for a handler that's bound to the submit() functionality under the pretense that it could be overriding my code?
[17:20:55] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily overriding, but it could be setting the location.  you said it only happens when you click though, right?
[17:21:07] <frostythesnowman> i'm not sure how heeirarchy works, but i'm binding this handler in the console, which happens after the page finishes loading
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> you said it's only not working when you click, right?
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> frostythesnowman ^
[17:22:44] <frostythesnowman> interesting, yes i believe that's right.  when i try submitting the form multiple times by pressing 'return', it doesn't submit multiple times
[17:22:57] <robertmaxrees> sounds like somebody bound a click handler instead.
[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> which is gross.
[17:23:32] <frostythesnowman> nevermind, sry! i can reproduce the error with return also
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:23:58] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, i'd look at submit and click handlers.
[17:24:30] <frostythesnowman> ok, will do. thanks!
[18:05:55] <frostythesnowman> mixpanel was the culprit! their track_forms functionality ignores validation that's triggered after the initial form submit and auto-submits the form after their API call finishes
[18:06:03] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[18:06:05] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)_
[18:06:18] <frostythesnowman> ty for pointing in the right direction :)
[18:06:33] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[18:06:38] <robertmaxrees> it's always something funky like that.
[18:45:50] <Elles> https://jsfiddle.net/bnd3ks45/ I want to create a json array with nodes given by divs with a name, is this the way you do it?
