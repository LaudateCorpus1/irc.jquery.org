[00:00:06] <noaXess> in the jquey-ui css on line 487 (in my case scope rudy) there is this definition: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5650278/, same is in the original css, w/o the scope.. if i use scoped css, button place is wrong and the css definition shown in the pastebin won't be used.. with original css it is used
[00:00:39] <coldhead> that must make you very sad
[00:00:42] <coldhead> it makes me very tired
[00:02:23] <noaXess> me toooo..
[00:03:21] <Dys> I'm trying to make the ,css(left) of an element equal zero minus the same element's width, and keep coming up short.
[00:03:27] <Dys> *.css
[00:03:51] <fabioportieri> you have margins or padding?
[00:04:01] <Qdest> outerWidth() ?
[00:04:27] <coldhead> ?outerwidth
[00:04:29] <bot-t> .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[00:04:39] <Dys> I have padding, but that's not the current problem. I should have used better wording. xD
[00:05:12] <coldhead> that's jQuery's theme for today
[00:05:35] * coldhead np: fugazi - blueprint
[00:05:51] <Dys> I meant that I couldn't get the equation to work at all. Not a number; probably because .css(left) has the "px" at the end, whereas the width doesn't.
[00:07:03] <Qdest> Dys » You can use parseInt()
[00:07:20] <Dys> Ah, alright. I'll give that a shot.
[00:07:20] <coldhead> ?eval ~~ "777px"
[00:07:24] <bot-t> coldhead: 0
[00:07:32] <coldhead> ?eval ~~ ("777px")
[00:07:33] <bot-t> coldhead: 0
[00:07:37] <coldhead> harsh
[00:07:45] <coldhead> ?eval ~~ ("777")
[00:07:46] <bot-t> coldhead: 777
[00:08:14] <coldhead> oh sheutje, it's seutje
[00:08:26] <seutje> coldhead: sup cloddy?

[00:32:43] <coldhead> I HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS DREAM OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[00:44:23] <coldhead> ah, i love this part of the day, where the CEO comes to see what i've achieved
[00:44:31] <coldhead> this is coldhead's moment to shine
[00:44:37] <coldhead> like a turd rolled in glitter
[00:44:40] <coldhead> in a dark room
[00:49:32] <tw2113> stop plotting to kidnap me coldhead
[00:52:26] <seutje> coldhead: if I was ever stuck in a dark room, I can only hope to have a turd rolled in glitter as majestic as you on me
[00:53:09] <coldhead> that is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me
[00:53:41] <seutje> I'd use gloves though
[00:53:49] <seutje> once u get glitter on you, it's for life
[00:54:04] <coldhead> i don't think any less of you for that
[01:30:10] <fabioportieri> what do you think of this http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/index.html
[01:31:01] <DaniG2k> alright guys
[01:31:14] <DaniG2k> I'm trying to get some checkboxes to be added to a query
[01:31:23] <DaniG2k> but I cant get it to display
[01:32:16] <DaniG2k> http://hpaste.org/87652
[01:32:18] <DaniG2k> thats what I have
[01:32:36] <DaniG2k> why isn't it even displaying in my Chrome console?
[01:32:46] <coldhead> looks good to me fabioportieri
[01:32:55] <coldhead> i'd use it, if i cared about older browsers
[01:33:09] <tw2113> not sure about ('ul :checkbox') DaniG2k
[01:33:09] <seutje> DaniG2k: console.log doesn't return anything
[01:33:23] <seutje> so search is undefined
[01:33:33] <seutje> chkbox is undefined
[01:33:42] <seutje> and query is undefined
[01:33:43] <coldhead> also you are missing a bunch of semicolons
[01:33:54] <seutje> and that return true doesn't rly do anything
[01:34:00] <coldhead> and that can annoy the js interpreter
[01:34:01] <DaniG2k> hahah lol
[01:34:06] <DaniG2k> then thats probably why
[01:34:14] <coldhead> it's like "well he didn't bother with the semis, i'm not going to even run this"
[01:34:18] <seutje> coldhead: you can annoy the js interpreter!
[01:34:32] <coldhead> yes but then the interpreter can annoy YOU
[01:34:52] <seutje> pft, shit rolls right off my back
[01:35:13] <coldhead> DaniG2k seems more sensitive
[01:35:16] <seutje> ain't no interpreter gonna push me around!
[01:36:04] <coldhead> well fuck this, i am sick of everythng and i hate the visit
[01:39:08] <pi3r> Hi there, I need some help on a silly regexp (http://regexpal.com/?flags=g&regex=%7B%7B(.%2B%3F)%7D%7D&input=%7B%7Bplop%7D%7Dasdasdasdasd%7B%7Btest%7D%7D) I don't understand why {{ and }} are kept in the result
[01:45:35] <DaniG2k> why is this code not being displayed to the console??
[01:46:00] <DaniG2k> http://hpaste.org/87652
[02:02:42] <DaniG2k> guys im trying to make a search query change depending on the checkboxes that are checked
[02:02:46] <DaniG2k> right now I have
[02:03:18] <DaniG2k> this -> http://hpaste.org/87652
[02:03:31] <DaniG2k> is the last return statement correct?
[02:03:43] <DaniG2k> im not sure how to actually run the submit part
[02:08:56] <seutje> DaniG2k: u wanna do the POST async or not?
[02:09:16] <DaniG2k> POST async?
[02:09:26] <DaniG2k> yeah it should submit the form
[02:11:09] <seutje> DaniG2k: why not just make these checkboxes part of the form
[02:11:15] <seutje> that way u can just post the form as-is
[02:11:44] <DaniG2k> I think they are part of the form already
[02:12:19] <DaniG2k> oh no wait
[02:12:22] <DaniG2k> they're not
[02:12:24] <DaniG2k> :P
[02:20:15] <DaniG2k> Im trying to form a search query depending on a various checkboxes
[02:20:37] <DaniG2k> I was able to get the string I need from the checkboxes with $('ul :checkbox').serialize();
[02:20:55] <DaniG2k> and I'm making my full query with var full_query = host+'/s/search.html?'+query+'&'+chkboxes;
[02:21:03] <DaniG2k> but I'm not sure how to send the form.
[02:21:13] <DaniG2k> I'm trying with return this.full_query;
[02:21:19] <DaniG2k> but it doesnt seem to work
[02:21:28] <fabioportieri> DaniG2k: you better off using ajax
[02:22:34] <DaniG2k> fabioportieri:  how can I do that
[02:22:40] <fabioportieri> DaniG2k: you use $.post inside that submit function, passing the modified url you got there and than return false
[02:23:43] <DaniG2k> fabioportieri: why returning false?
[02:24:12] <fabioportieri> because you are submitting via ajax
[02:24:51] <didiergm> Does anyone know if Jquerymobile officially tested against JQ 2.0 ?
[02:25:24] <fabioportieri> DaniG2k: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5004233/jquery-ajax-post-example
[02:30:53] <DaniG2k> fabioportieri: I think the way I'm doing it is simpler
[02:30:57] <DaniG2k> but
[02:31:18] <DaniG2k> for some reason that final return this.full_query doesn't submit the query properly
[02:31:35] <fabioportieri> because it doesn't make sense to return a url inside the submit
[02:33:39] <DaniG2k> right
[02:33:57] <DaniG2k> fabioportieri: I want to submit a post request with a specified url string
[02:35:08] <fabioportieri> DaniG2k: a quick try would be modify the form action with the url you got, than return true, but i never tested this
[02:40:26] <fabioportieri> yesterday i saw the best jquery plugin of all times
[02:41:00] <fabioportieri> http://theonion.github.io/fartscroll.js/
[02:42:33] <seutje> it's not even a jQuery plugin o.O
[02:43:33] <fabioportieri> lol
[02:43:36] <fabioportieri> i didn't notice
[03:12:17] <sandyRussell> Hi I've a problem I'm filling some html from a json url and then initialize a modal to the container also having some imgs in there but I can't pass the url https://gist.github.com/anonymous/514448144ca6265dab89
[03:12:25] <sandyRussell> please help
[03:13:06] <sandyRussell> I even tried window.imgs_url but that even doesn't work what should I do?
[03:14:20] <fabioportieri> please elaborate what do you mean by not work, and i see a syntax error there?  = '</a>
[03:15:13] <sandyRussell> yes I don't have that in my code sorry
[03:15:48] <sandyRussell> I initialize window.img_url = "" out of getjson func
[03:16:29] <sandyRussell> and then assign it like what i have prefixing it with window. of course and then pass it to the other getjson
[03:17:05] <sandyRussell> I always get the imgs_url  empty
[03:17:38] <PugSQL> Having an issue with IE8 and $.ajax... I have a wildcard in my select list.. <option value="%"> .. but when I pass it to the url it doesn't work. Works if I hardcode it, and also works in Chrome, Firefox. Anyone have an idea?
[03:18:00] <sandyRussell> and if I had the modal inside the first getjson the browser hangs I'm not trying to load lots of data by any means
[03:19:31] <sandyRussell> fabioportieri: you still there?
[03:21:36] <fabioportieri> sandyRussell: problem is at the time your modal shows the async function doesn't yet get called
[03:21:52] <sandyRussell> yeah so?
[03:22:02] <fabioportieri> so i would try put your modal inside the first getJson callback
[03:22:13] <sandyRussell> yeah but the browser hangs
[03:22:44] <sandyRussell> just so lil data get parsed
[03:24:06] <fabioportieri> hangs even with one row of data?
[03:24:10] <sandyRussell> I mean really my computer freezes because of this
[03:24:28] <sandyRussell> yes when I have images json inside the first one
[03:24:35] <sandyRussell> I mean the modal as a whole
[03:25:15] <sandyRussell> images are like 8 rows and when I saved the json file (it's dynamically generated) it was like 1.7 kb no big deal
[03:25:20] <fabioportieri> why do you need 2 json calls?
[03:26:15] <sandyRussell> because they are dynamic each one has it's own db table a service method gets called and then I fire the getJson to get the data for each part
[03:26:34] <sandyRussell> not our story anyway
[03:27:50] <fabioportieri> i think you should use deferred
[03:28:55] <fabioportieri> but i don't know why it hangs sorry
[03:29:09] <sandyRussell> ok thank you
[03:30:58] <fabioportieri> got any errors?
[03:32:31] <fabioportieri> i would pinpoint the location of the hanging
[03:36:07] <Trical> hi, in jquerymobile, i'm trying to make a fb login function, it works on desktop but on mobile it loads m.facebook.. and then goes back to my index page instead of giving the fb login popup
[03:47:15] <yousaf> hi all
[03:47:35] <yousaf> is there a way to include a .js after another .js has been loaded
[03:47:57] <yousaf> basically if i have 1.js, I want to make sure that has loaded and then load 2.js
[03:48:00] <fabioportieri> yousaf: $.getScript()
[03:48:10] <fabioportieri> ah no sorry
[03:48:43] <yousaf> fabioportieri i have this http://paste.laravel.com/r6m
[03:48:50] <yousaf> it loads woopra.js
[03:49:09] <yousaf> I want to load another .js straight after woopra.js is loaded/parsed
[03:50:43] <fabioportieri> you could do with the function mentioned above but
[03:50:52] <fabioportieri> http://capmousse.github.io/include.js/
[03:52:29] <yousaf> so I can use that to queue them one after another?
[03:52:53] <fabioportieri> yes or
[03:53:06] <fabioportieri> you can merge all inside a unique js file
[03:53:14] <eobet> does anyone know of a mosaic gallery that can contain text as well as images and can randomly switch two tiles at once in synch?
[03:53:33] <yousaf> but the issue herer is that if 2.js loads/parses before 1.js then that is a problem
[03:54:54] <fabioportieri> yousaf: another approach would be http://requirejs.org/
[03:55:36] <fabioportieri> probably better than the other link i gave you
[03:58:08] <noaXess> hey all
[03:58:12] <fabioportieri> are you placing script inside <head>?
[03:58:56] <yousaf> yes
[03:59:49] <noaXess> earlier i asked about a problem with jquery-ui theme with a custom scope (.rudy, just a name)... can someone explain, why on original theme http://goo.gl/CYqQO the close icon of the icon is on correct location and on the same them with scope .rudy, the close icon is on worng place? check this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/thomi_ch/4KgnJ/
[04:00:28] <fabioportieri> yousaf: this is a tutorial for requirejs http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-requirejs-for-effective-javascript-module-loading/
[04:00:34] <noaXess> i made also a local test, with loading just jquey 1.9.1, jquery-ui 1.103.3 with the them applied scope .rudy, same problem
[04:00:54] <yousaf> thank you
[04:01:00] <fabioportieri> yousaf: i heard that if you place scripts inside body they get executed synchrounsly so the problem will be solved
[04:01:12] <yousaf> doesnt
[04:01:20] <yousaf> i placed the second js in footer and same thing
[04:02:00] <fabioportieri> uhmm then i would go with placing all inside a js file (libs exluced) or using requirejs
[04:10:54] <noaXess> found a bug about my problem: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8324
[04:11:03] <noaXess> how you guys wok with different ui themes?
[04:14:02] <fabioportieri> what do you mean?
[04:17:55] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I have a plugin which loads jQuery if not available and then executes itself... Now, I want to provide users with an onload-hook for my plugin but don't know where to start. Such as myPlugin.onload(function(){ plugin & jQuery is available }); ... Thanks for any pointers! :-)
[04:23:19] <noaXess> fabioportieri: how u use different jquery-ui's in the same app? eg. for admin you use one them, for customers view another theme
[04:23:22] <noaXess> with a scope
[04:23:31] <fabioportieri> noaXess: no idea
[04:23:36] <noaXess> css scope.. seams dialog are broken in a them with a css scope
[04:23:46] <fabioportieri> JD-Robbs: you could google about jquery plugin authoring
[04:24:02] <fabioportieri> noaXess: sorry i never used more than a jquery ui at once
[04:24:23] <noaXess> i need them for a admin gui and for a customer gui
[04:24:46] <JD-Robbs> fabioportieri: thanks for the pointer. I already found a lot on boilerplates & best rpactive. However, things are a bit weird since jQuery is not even loaded by some pages. And then my plugin loads it
[04:24:50] <noaXess> and now with latest jquery-ui it's broken as exlained in this bug: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8324
[04:24:54] <JD-Robbs> So I can't use jQuery before the plugin is loaded
[04:26:07] <noaXess> what i see is, if i use a them with a css scope, that not all css's are applied...
[04:26:26] <fabioportieri> JD-Robbs: i think you need jquery loaded in order to load a plugin for it :|
[04:27:54] <JD-Robbs> Hence my question ;-) ... MNy only idea is to store a callback in an object, say "myPluginSettigns.callback" and then look if any callbacks are attached once it's loaded... Feels dirty though...
[04:32:18] <anli> Has jquery autocomplete started with the behavior of not showing a label when something gets selected, but instead the value?
[04:33:02] <noaXess> check this, jquery-ui with css scope: http://i.imgur.com/dmIoV24.png and here is the original them w/o scope: http://i.imgur.com/WLaSyos.png
[04:33:04] <noaXess> strange not???
[04:34:32] <Trical> http://i.imgur.com/nBm2W7I.png the best practice to populate this info from jquery.. would that be to give everything an id, or is there a more clean way?
[04:39:04] <samuel02> Trical, have you looked at templating? things like handlebars, mustache etc.
[04:39:14] <seutje> Trical: u'll probably need a wrapper, putting an identifier on the wrapper should be enough, u can cache that and then traverse down from there
[04:39:35] <seutje> if you need to do this multiple times, like in a loop or something, consider using a templating solution
[04:39:53] <Trical> hmmmmm
[04:40:24] <Trical> I only need to do this once onthis page
[04:42:10] <Trical> the handlebars thing changes an object to a block of html?
[04:42:18] <fabioportieri> JD-Robbs: i meant you need jquery loaded if you want your first line of plugin to no throw a syntax error
[04:42:28] <seutje> then it would probably be unnecessary overhead to use a templating library
[04:43:05] <Trical> yes, I might have to look into that later if I want to search for things in my app, and need a list
[04:43:17] <seutje> Trical: most templating solutions require you to specify the template and throw a specifically formatted object in there
[04:43:46] <Trical> i'll just stick with the simple way for now
[04:43:53] <seutje> this will return either a text blob or DOM fragment you can then inject wherever u want
[04:53:53] <anli> When I navigate through the autocomplete dropdown elements with the arrow keys, the id for each of the element shows up in the textbox, why?
[04:53:59] <anli> (the value)
[05:07:16] <anli> Which events occurs when I navigate through the dropdown list elements of a jquery autocomplete?
[05:07:23] <anli> I need to set the value of the textbox there
[05:09:23] <seutje> anli: select
[05:09:32] <seutje> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[05:09:38] <anli> Doesnt seem to be that way, it only triggers when I select an item
[05:21:36] <noaXess> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9280
[05:34:34] <motaka2> Hello, What I want is when the user clicks on a link I get some html via ajax. $("a").on("click",...return false ) works for current existing link but not for those who appear via ajax html ? How can I cover all links ?
[05:41:12] <fikst> motaka2, you need to put the click event handler on the <a>'s that are added with ajax
[05:41:44] <fikst> $('a').on only puts handles on the tags that are currently on the page
[05:42:03] <fikst> better is to put the click handler on a common parent element
[05:42:20] <fikst> $('#parent').on('click', 'a', function(){})
[05:48:28] <motaka2> fikst: thanks for you help
[05:48:46] <motaka2> fikst: after two days it is solved now. thank you very much
[06:15:48] <motaka2> fikst: Sorry but it is not solved
[06:16:34] <fikst> motaka2, create a jsfiddle that demonstrates your problem, and I'll take a look at it
[06:17:07] <motaka2> fikst: I cant do that
[06:18:00] <motaka2> fikst: It is complucated
[06:18:53] <motaka2> this is what i did:  $("#content-in").on("click",'a', function() { but it just works on <a>s that are not loaded via ajax
[06:19:19] <jo_> G'morning @jquery.
[06:19:29] <fikst> if your new content is placed inside #content-in, it should work for the newly added a tags
[06:19:59] <seutje> unless newly added <a>s have a handler that calls e.stopPropagation
[06:20:09] <seutje> (e being event)
[06:20:26] <jop008> anyone used lawnchair.js?
[06:21:08] <motaka2> seutje: can you tellme what I should do ?
[06:21:33] <seutje> motaka2: make an isolated test-case illustrating the problem
[06:22:04] <motaka2> seutje: I dont know how I can do that.
[06:22:36] <motaka2> fikst: my new content is within content-in
[06:23:12] <fikst> it should work then, unless the case tha seutje said
[06:23:23] <fikst> you really have to make a fiddle
[06:23:31] <fikst> make a simple page with some a tags
[06:23:50] <fikst> put a button on the page that adds some a tags when u click it
[06:23:55] <fikst> that should be enough to test it
[06:24:16] <blez> when I have $(this), is there a way to serialize it and send it to another browser where it reads the same element?
[06:24:21] <blez> like a button
[06:24:56] <seutje> motaka2: fine, I'll give u a use-case where it does work http://jsfiddle.net/6aWzn/
[06:25:48] <sacho> blez, serialization is your smallest problem.
[06:25:52] <seutje> blez: u can't serialize a reference to a DOM object
[06:25:59] <sacho> How do you envision "sending it to another browser"?
[06:26:17] <seutje> it's not even rly the same element then
[06:26:40] <sacho> Sure, but you can create an element with the same properties.
[06:27:09] <seutje> yeah, definitely, just know it's not entirely the same
[06:27:16] <seutje> just like $() !== $()
[06:28:55] <blez> ok, how can I send a DOM reference to a different browser?
[06:29:04] <blez> can I somehow serialize it
[06:31:02] <sacho> Serialization is the least of your worries.
[06:31:12] <sacho> "sending to a different browser" is too vague.
[06:33:20] <blez> when I have firefox, chrome and a server. How to transfer the reference from one element from firefox to chrome for example
[06:35:32] <fabioportieri> uh?
[06:35:38] <jgomes> blez: javascript object are always an object no matter what browser you're using
[06:35:50] <fabioportieri> the matrix
[06:36:11] <jgomes> blez: javascript is javascrit every where
[06:36:38] <blez> I know.
[06:37:12] <seutje> blez: use an ID
[06:37:16] <blez> but when you have a page with 2000 butons without any ids, and you've selected the 1001 one, how to send the selection to a different browser
[06:37:23] <blez> seutje not every element has an id
[06:37:41] <seutje> blez: just send 'button:nth-of-type(1001)'
[06:37:44] <shoky> blez: you can't transfer the reference, and there's nothing built-in to "serialize" it for you automatically, use ids/classes/other attributes intelligently. also see ?index
[06:37:50] <bot-t> blez, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[06:38:17] <seutje> u'll have to re-query the DOM in the other browser though
[06:38:18] <fabioportieri> sending an object to a different browser... UH?
[06:38:33] <seutje> fabioportieri: actually, just the reference, but yeah...
[06:38:33] <blez> not object, I want the reference
[06:38:46] <fabioportieri> seutje: i don't understand..
[06:38:47] <seutje> if it was the object, it would have been simple
[06:38:53] <seutje> el.outerHTML
[06:39:03] <seutje> or element, rather
[06:39:07] <jgomes> blez: you have to find a way to uncynically identify it
[06:39:10] <fabioportieri> that's sci-fi talk
[06:39:21] <blez> there is nothing sci-fi about it
[06:39:29] <seutje> fabioportieri: he targets an element, and then wants to send that reference (as in "item number x") to the other browser
[06:40:00] <fabioportieri> how can you send stuff to another brwoser?
[06:40:03] <blez> jgomes yea, I was thinking to fill every element with unique .data(), but I'm not sure
[06:40:24] <seutje> fabioportieri: websockets -> server -> websockets -> client?
[06:40:35] <seutje> blez: u can't select on .data() contents afaik
[06:40:51] <seutje> also, setting that data in one browser won't persist to the other
[06:40:55] <seutje> hence "client side"
[06:41:10] <fabioportieri> still not getting it
[06:42:04] <blez> seutje I'll have a server too
[06:42:10] <blez> but I stucked on this part
[06:42:20] <fabioportieri> is there a piece of code to illustrate that? or docs
[06:42:33] <jgomes> blez: the problem is more, what you would put in the .data(), to uniquely identify that object, no?
[06:43:08] <blez> let's say I have browser A and browser B, I'll generate .data() with unique ids for A and the same ids for B
[06:43:19] <blez> and then I can connect the both
[06:43:47] <Vasa> biez: you are trying to send a button selection online to another browser?
[06:44:19] <blez> yes
[06:44:28] <Vasa> is a server a viable option?
[06:44:29] <blez> not only button, any type
[06:44:31] <Vasa> to connect them in between?
[06:44:44] <Vasa> because it would be too difficult to do so directly at this time
[06:45:01] <blez> it is viable
[06:45:30] <Vasa> well i can suggest to have a server with a server side language such as php, to await the send of browser A and browser B should refresh the server to wait for results
[06:45:31] <jgomes> blez: on button click the the first browser window co
[06:46:08] <Vasa> you can find an example in online chats
[06:46:08] <seutje> blez: like $('*').each(function(i, el) { $(el).data('myApp-identifier', i); }); ? and then to find it $('*').filter(function() { return $(this).data('myApp-identifier') === theNumberWeAreLookingFor }); ?
[06:46:20] <seutje> that's pretty horrible
[06:46:52] <blez> Vasa that's not the problem, the problem is the sending of the reference
[06:46:56] <jgomes> blez: on button click the the first browser sends selection to the server and when the second browser window communicate to the server, the server sends the first browser window selection to him
[06:46:59] <blez> seutje exactly
[06:47:49] <blez> jgomes if you have 2000 buttons without ids, how can you know which one is selected
[06:47:57] <seutje> better off putting the unique number in the attribute
[06:47:58] <Vasa> well
[06:48:06] <seutje> much cheaper to find then afaict
[06:48:30] <jgomes> blez: you just told  us you can generate the ids....
[06:48:36] <Vasa> you could do something like: $('buttons').click(function(){       this=is the selected button         });
[06:48:44] <Vasa> or if you use inputs
[06:48:52] <Vasa> you could do something like: $('input').click(function(){       this=is the selected button         });
[06:49:07] <seutje> blez: like $('*').each(function(i, el) { $(el).attr('data-myApp-identifier-' + i, true); }); ? and then to find it $('[data-myApp-identifier-' + theNumberWeAreLookingFor + ']')
[06:49:22] <MindSpark> hello guys, I am using the datepicker widget as a calendar. It opens up a dialog showing events on the day clicked. Now I want to increase the size of the boxes, which I simply did using CSS, and now I need to add some data to each box indicating a summary of the events.
[06:49:23] <jgomes> blez: you can generate those ids on the server, that way, all browser windows are in sync
[06:49:28] <blez> if I generate the ids with .data() for example, the problem will be that different pages will look different on different browsers
[06:49:44] <blez> like not having one element on chrome for example, that will scamble all ids
[06:49:48] <MindSpark> However, obviously datepikcer gets the day from the content of the td.a ny workaround for that?
[06:49:52] <shoky> blez: here's an example... http://jsfiddle.net/Xxzm4/
[06:51:43] <blez> shoky what's the idea of section?
[06:52:24] <shoky> blez: that's just to demonstrate a non-flat structure.. not important
[06:52:27] <blez> the guys on stackoverflow told me to generate xpath to every element
[06:53:15] <shoky> that could work.. sounds like overkill
[06:53:27] <shoky> and a pain
[06:54:06] <fabioportieri> i don't get it
[07:08:16] <Evan_Donovan> i have an image slider on the following site: http://www.christianvolunteering.org/ that isn't working on Chrome. the fourth image fails to display.
[07:08:21] <Evan_Donovan> it works fine on Firefox.
[07:08:34] <Evan_Donovan> could someone help me figure out what is wrong with it in Chrome?
[07:10:34] <Evan_Donovan> i've posted this also as a question on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16484226/image-slider-not-working-in-chrome
[07:12:18] <Evan_Donovan> it works in IE also
[07:12:29] <jgomes> Evan_Donovan: it's working here (top left?)
[07:12:42] <Evan_Donovan> jgomes: it's working in Chrome?
[07:12:58] <jgomes> Evan_Donovan: yes
[07:12:59] <sacho> Which image is the fourth image?
[07:13:03] <Evan_Donovan> the top left is showing the image of City Vision Internships?
[07:13:14] <Evan_Donovan> that's the image that is a white screen on Chrome
[07:13:25] <Evan_Donovan> it appears to also be a white screen in IE compatibility mode
[07:13:33] <Evan_Donovan> the other images are all fine
[07:13:45] <amcsi_work> <Evan_Donovan> I dson't know what's causing it, but it's related to the image's height
[07:14:02] <sacho> Ah, that fourth image.
[07:14:02] <Evan_Donovan> amcsi_work: so i should shorten the image?
[07:14:03] <amcsi_work> by setting the image's height 2px smaller in chrome developer tools, I got it to show
[07:14:10] <Evan_Donovan> excellent!
[07:14:13] <Evan_Donovan> i will try that
[07:14:20] <seutje> Evan_Donovan: .image_reel > a { float: left; }
[07:14:53] <Evan_Donovan> seutje: that rule would fix the images, you say?
[07:14:56] <seutje> Evan_Donovan: the iframe is block level
[07:15:03] <seutje> it precedes the last image
[07:15:08] <seutje> pushing it down
[07:15:22] <seutje> floating the link wrappers seems to take care of it
[07:15:31] <Evan_Donovan> ok. i will do that
[07:15:33] <seutje> btw, love the animated GIF slideshow
[07:15:38] <seutje> :P
[07:15:44] <Evan_Donovan> heh
[07:15:46] <Evan_Donovan> that is old.
[07:17:57] <sacho> uhh, I didn't know floating directives bubbled up
[07:18:24] <seutje> WAT?
[07:18:42] <Evan_Donovan> seutje: yes that fixed it. thanks!
[07:18:51] <Evan_Donovan> thanks to everyone else who offered suggestions as well.
[07:19:01] <seutje> you sound so surprised :(
[07:43:57] <graphettion> Evan_Donovan: Don't help the Christians!
[07:44:01] <graphettion> lol jk
[07:44:27] <Evan_Donovan> i get that a lot when i come on these channels...oh well
[07:44:56] <graphettion> heh
[07:57:59] <TeraJL> i have a window.onbeforeunload with return "exit?"; and i need to clean before the user exit, how can i know if the user clicked yes or not?
[07:59:53] <NoiseEee> TeraJL: you cannot.
[08:00:42] <TeraJL> NoiseEee: i can only choose between asking the user or cleaning?
[08:01:01] <NoiseEee> you can only present them with something before they exit; you never get the answer.
[08:23:57] <kai> hi folks
[08:25:06] <kai> if I want to replace a set of charactes in an ASCII string by a set of other characters, but would like to only pass over the string once.. what's the best way to do this in JavaScript?
[08:26:08] <pachet> .replace?
[08:28:47] <dan2k3k4> hmm
[08:29:05] <dan2k3k4> what is the equivalent of:
[08:29:06] <dan2k3k4>     document.getElementById("canvas_swatch").addEventListener("touchstart", touchHandler, true);
[08:29:09] <dan2k3k4> in jQuery?
[08:29:13] <dan2k3k4> .bind()?
[08:30:18] <dan2k3k4> .on()
[08:30:32] <NoiseEee> $('#canvas_swatch').on('touchstart',function(ev) { //ev is the event });
[08:31:18] <dan2k3k4> NoiseEee: thanks!
[08:31:28] <NoiseEee> np
[08:31:42] <dan2k3k4> can I also do that for different IDs in one go?
[08:32:08] <dan2k3k4> like $(['#id1', '#id2'])
[08:32:08] <oxez> Hello. If I have $(element).trigger('change'), and somewhere else I have $jquery17(element).on('change', callback) -- is it supposed to work? An event triggered and listned by different jquery versions?
[08:32:19] <NoiseEee> yes, or by class (^^ incorrect syntax)
[08:33:02] <dan2k3k4> it's to add the touchHandler function for 3 sliders (each different id, but use same classes)
[08:33:09] <dan2k3k4> so would using the class be better than?
[08:33:13] <NoiseEee> dan2k3k4: for sure
[08:34:00] <NoiseEee> dan2k3k4: but ideally start from parent.  $('#someParentID').on('touchstart','.classWeCareAbout',function(){})
[08:34:32] <dan2k3k4> aye but the parent ID is 'too large' - I don't want the touch events outside of the 3 sliders
[08:35:40] <dan2k3k4> NoiseEee: oh wait re-reading that, that would bind the function(){} to just the classWeCareAbout? and not to the parentID?
[08:35:42] <NoiseEee> if it indeed affects performance (not sure it would), then sure you could $('#someID,#anotherID').on(etc)
[08:35:55] <NoiseEee> dan2k3k4: yes indeed, only .classWeCareAbout would fire the handler
[08:39:55] <dan2k3k4> hmm doesn't seem to work
[08:40:07] <dan2k3k4>     $("#game").on("touchstart", ".ui-slider", function(event){touchHandler(event);} );
[08:40:26] <dan2k3k4> also tried with just: touchHandler
[08:44:13] <NoiseEee> perhaps you're not placing it in the correct part of the document, etc etc, i assure you it should work :)
[08:44:50] <ilyai> dan2k3k4: jQuery registers handlers (using on()) by calling .addEventListener() but the third argument is false. ,not true!
[08:46:17] <dan2k3k4> is there a way to set true then?
[08:46:30] <NoiseEee> ilyai: ???
[08:46:32] <ilyai> dan2k3k4: try using addEventListener if you really need capturing event handler
[08:46:38] <NoiseEee> ilyai: ???
[08:48:20] <ilyai> dan2k3k4: since not all browsers supports registering capturing handlers jQuery doesn't try to emulate that feature.
[08:49:39] <NoiseEee> i'd think thrice before taking that advice
[08:52:21] <ilyai> well maybe the latest version eg. 2.0 supports this, but I'm not sure.
[08:53:34] <dan2k3k4> hmm well decided to revert to document.getElementByID and just wrapped the sliders in their own div (since they're all next to each other anyway with nothing else there) - works for me, off back home :)
[08:59:54] <kai> pachet: but I can only specify one pattern there, right?
[09:00:17] <kai> pachet: in replace, that is. Sorry, got called into a meeting and was afk for a while
[09:00:39] <Eviltwin> How many patterns do you need to specify?
[09:01:02] <pachet> ^ i guess i need more specifics about your use case to be helpful
[09:02:48] <kai> Well, basically I want to create complements of DNA sequences. So I have strings composed of the characters ACGT, and want to replace them by TGCA respectively
[09:03:58] <kai> and the strings can be pretty large as well, so I'd like to avoid having to iterate over them multiple times
[09:04:17] <Eviltwin> Iterating is going to be the fastest solution
[09:04:51] <kai> apart from the obvious logistic problem of "ACGT".replace(/A/g, 'T') leaving me with "TCGT", and no way of telling the both Ts apart
[09:05:03] <Eviltwin> You'd use a temporary
[09:05:27] <Eviltwin> .replace(/T/g, '#').replace(/A/g, 'T').replace(/#/g, 'A')
[09:05:34] <Eviltwin> But that's going to be super slow
[09:05:44] <kai> Eviltwin: sure, but iterating one vs. four (or even six) times does make a difference
[09:06:17] <kai> which is why I'm wondering if there's a better solution
[09:06:21] <Eviltwin> This will be probably at least a thousand times faster: http://pastebin.com/NSL4Zhn9
[09:07:26] <kai> in-place would be best, I guess
[09:07:46] <kai> but that should work similarly
[09:08:01] <Eviltwin> There's no such thing as in-place string manipulation in JavaScript
[09:08:06] <Eviltwin> The strings aren't mutable
[09:08:36] <kai> hm, ok...
[09:09:16] <kai> and I guess I can't just treat the string as binary either
[09:09:43] <Eviltwin> I'm not quite sure what you mean by that
[09:09:55] <deepy> I'm using the following http://dpaste.org/dSjhj/ and expecting application/json
[09:10:13] <deepy> and also getting valid JSON, but I get a syntaxError: invalid label
[09:10:46] <deepy> and for some reason my URL now includes theparam callback with a key of  jQuery151008491683265758254_1368200989920
[09:11:29] <relipse> most common web developer comment: still needs to be fixed on IE
[09:11:32] <kai> Eviltwin: well, treating the string as array of 8bit integers..
[09:11:39] <jgomes> deepy: seems to be a server-side problem
[09:12:10] <deepy> I'm getting application/json and JSONLint identifies it as valid and I can't see anything wrong with it, what on my server-side would be the problem?
[09:12:13] <jgomes> jgomes: can you share some details to us on that part
[09:12:19] <Eviltwin> kai: And how would that help you?
[09:12:53] <jgomes> deepy: can you share some details to us on that part
[09:13:03] <kai> Eviltwin: well, there I could do foo[i] = transform[foo[i]];
[09:13:22] <kai> I don't care if I use 'A' or whatever the numerical value of A is
[09:13:23] <Eviltwin> You could do that if it's an array too
[09:13:30] <Eviltwin> How long are these sequences anyway?
[09:13:58] <deepy> Sure, what do you want me to elaborate on? This is what I'm getting from my server http://dpaste.org/VPnYw/
[09:14:17] <kai> well, up to 25 MB, I guess, I expect to see up to 10 MB frequently
[09:14:40] <Eviltwin> And why are you trying to do this in JavaScript?
[09:15:02] <deepy> It's been run through JSONLint which added some whitespace, but the data is the exact same jgomes
[09:15:33] <jgomes> deepy: in firebug or something did you confirmed that the response has the json header
[09:15:52] <kai> I want to do input validation in the browser befor uploading up to 25 megs of data to a server
[09:16:15] <kai> also, the server might take a while before it errors out on invalid data, and I'd like to improve the user feedback
[09:16:22] <deepy> json header? If you mean that it's being sent with a Content-Type of application/json then yes
[09:16:29] <deepy> both firebug and chrome agrees on that
[09:16:58] <Eviltwin> And that requires complementing the sequence?
[09:17:16] <jgomes> yes... humm.... dono... seems to be every thing in place
[09:17:33] <deepy> Well, I'm merging this code from another branch of this software and on that one I am NOT seeing the callback parameter in the header
[09:17:38] <kai> not necessarily. I'm just trying to provide the API Bio<language> libraries tend to have
[09:18:02] <kai> and Sequence objects usually have a .complement() and .reverse_complement()
[09:18:18] <kai> if the "loop and build a new string" is the best option I have, fine
[09:18:28] <kai> I don't expect that part to be used a lot :)
[09:18:55] <kai> but I'd like to have a library that I could use both from the client as well as from, say, node or somesuch
[09:18:56] <Eviltwin> It almost certainly is
[09:19:18] <kai> ok, fair enough, the for loop it is then.
[09:19:55] <dcherman2> kai: for doing string replacement on single letters?
[09:20:25] <kai> dcherman2: for replacing a small number of single letters by specific other single letters on large strings
[09:20:29] <deepy> and it's also adding _Hace_ 1368202791421
[09:21:03] <dcherman2> kai: you might want to jsperf just using a simple regex replace.  http://jsfiddle.net/FGuDe/
[09:22:24] <kai> dcherman2: hm, I didn't know you could pass a function, I'll also give that a try
[09:22:45] <jgomes> deepy: where are you getting the error? inside the "callback" function? did you tried to make a console log on the success function to see whats in json var received?
[09:23:33] <deepy> jgomes: jquery is throwing the error
[09:23:33] <Eviltwin> That's even slower I think
[09:23:37] <deepy> SyntaxError: invalid label
[09:23:44] <deepy> Google seems to hint that it's trying to do JSONP
[09:24:25] <deepy> I'm not doing JSONP and I don't want to do it either, so I tried jsonp: false, but it still seems to be doing it
[09:24:53] <kai> Eviltwin: I'll just benchmark the "naive" approach, the regex-with-function and your suggestion on some real data and have a look
[09:24:56] <jgomes> deepy: is url on a different domain?
[09:25:13] <deepy> Nope
[09:25:21] <deepy> it's even a relative URL
[09:25:33] <kai> Eviltwin: I agree that a hash lookup should be faster in theory :)
[09:31:03] <Eviltwin> kai: Here you are: http://jsperf.com/dna-complement
[09:31:15] <jgomes> deepy: in the data you're sending is there any parameter named "jsoncallback"?
[09:32:05] <Joel> http://jsfiddle.net/xsGv9/ - why do I only get two iterations before it stops automatically updating?
[09:33:17] <jgomes> Joel: Error: useless setInterval call (missing quotes around argument?)
[09:33:50] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/xsGv9/1/
[09:34:00] <Eviltwin> Joel: ^
[09:34:40] <Joel> Eviltwin: doesn't work here
[09:34:42] <ilyai> Joel: nextCan() function is out of scope
[09:34:45] <Joel> jgomes: will look at that post lunch
[09:34:56] <ilyai> *nextCat()
[09:35:00] <Eviltwin> Well I don't know what you were trying to do
[09:35:06] <Eviltwin> But this is certainly an improvement
[09:35:39] <deepy> jgomes: it's jQuery's fault
[09:35:46] <Joel> Eviltwin: it has less functionality then what I pasted, lol.
[09:35:49] <deepy> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8084
[09:35:52] <Joel> lunch, bbiab.
[09:35:57] <deepy> jgomes: I solved the JSONP problems with the help of that link
[09:36:06] <deepy> setting jsonp: null, jsonpCallback: null, solved it
[09:36:20] <jgomes> Joel: Eviltwin solve it for you
[09:36:30] <kai> Eviltwin: awesome, thanks :)
[09:38:00] <madabyss> Hey guys. I'm using javascript to load some ajax content. Part of the content is a large high-res image. How can preload that image before displaying the content...?
[09:38:29] <jgomes> deepy: I thought  it could be this to: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2822609/invalid-label-firebug-error-with-jquery-getjson
[09:39:16] <jgomes> deepy: because your data_type is already set to json
[09:39:55] <jgomes> deepy: that error should not occur, am I right?

[10:04:27] <Eviltwin> I use that trick pretty frequently
[10:04:42] <BillCriswell> It's great for setting up examples here.
[10:05:00] <Eviltwin> madabyss: This is a more full-featured example: http://jsfiddle.net/xepU4/
[10:05:16] <Eviltwin> Tells you as each image loads
[10:05:42] <Eviltwin> Not necessary for it to work, just to see what's going on
[10:06:11] <madabyss> Eviltwin: Thanks bro, that's really helpful
[10:08:20] <Eviltwin> madabyss: Might be worth it to change $(this).on("load", def.resolve); to $(this).on("load error", def.resolve);
[10:08:33] <Eviltwin> Otherwise if one of them fails to load, the content will never show up
[10:08:40] <madabyss> Got it
[10:08:58] <madabyss> Clean code Eviltwin!
[10:09:11] <madabyss> I like clean code
[10:11:22] <drakythe> hey guys, I'm using colorbox on a site, and also some minor jQuery to collapse a div when its header is clicked. It all works great, unless you open the colorbox and browse through the images, after you do that clicking the div header to collapse it results in a 'bouncing' effect where the div will open and close multiple times based on how many images in the colorbox you looked at.
[10:11:28] <drakythe> Any idea how to stop this bejavior?
[10:11:32] <drakythe> behavior*
[10:12:11] <halcyon1234> Can I catch an invalid selector and suppress the error that jQuery would otherwise throw? $("#"), for example.
[10:12:14] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ drakythe
[10:12:14] <b-ot> drakythe: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:12:16] <bot-t> drakythe, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:12:28] <Eviltwin> halcyon1234: Replace jQuery.fn.error, I think
[10:12:38] <dcherman2> or just use a try/catch
[10:13:23] <halcyon1234> ............. for some reason I completely forgot javascript had try/catch. :|
[10:13:26] <halcyon1234> Thanks, dcherman!
[10:14:45] <drakythe> Eviltwin: http://sur.drupal02.worxco.net/drealty_listing/mls-11581385 is a site it is happening. each of the "... Details" headers are clickable to collapse the div below. The image in the top left is clickabe to open a colorbox. Collapsing the divs works fine until you open the colorbox, at which point you get the bouncing behavior
[10:14:47] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[10:14:52] <Eviltwin> halcyon1234: jQuery.find.error
[10:15:05] <Eviltwin> halcyon1234: http://jsfiddle.net/MgHLw/
[10:15:14] <MacDada> hi, does jquery have a method to use like `var tags = $('.tag').join(',', function() { return $(this).attr('data-tag'); })` ? I want to get a string of 'data-tag' attributes of elements.
[10:15:43] <MacDada> I could use each and join them "manually", but maybe there is some better method?
[10:15:49] <Eviltwin> MacDada: $('.tag').map(function() { ... }).get().join(',')
[10:15:50] <Joel> jgomes: what?
[10:16:15] * MacDada reading docs
[10:17:14] <Eviltwin> drakythe: Where's the code that handles the collapsing?
[10:17:49] <MacDada> Eviltwin: that's what I was looking for :D thx!
[10:22:01] <drakythe> Eviltwin: here is the raw code. http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/HXgJJ/ -- It has handled via Drupal.behaviors, which best I can tell is effectively document.ready just inside of a framework Drupal understands and can work with more easily.
[10:24:09] <Eviltwin> drakythe: I'm pretty sure what's happening is this is being called more than once
[10:25:06] <drakythe> Eviltwin: That makes sense, since the bouncing behavior is effectively the same as clicking the div repeatedly, I just can't figure out why triggering a colorbox would start that
[10:25:40] <Eviltwin> I'd try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/HXgJJ/1/
[10:25:57] <Eviltwin> I'm assuming before calling attach again it would have called detach
[10:27:40] <zzizz> Hey guys anyone know of a plugin that has similar functionality to http://sputnikcreative.com/ to give that opacity effect on the bottom items while scrolling.. how they are dim at the bottom but when you scroll they come to full opacity..
[10:34:31] <drakythe> Eviltwin: alright, what is that detach trying to do? sorry half this code is borroed from a co-worker who isn't in today, so I'm still learning what everything does
[10:34:48] <Eviltwin> Remove the click listeners
[10:34:59] <Eviltwin> So that when reattach happens, it's not a problem
[10:35:04] <Eviltwin> There will still only be one set attached
[10:39:04] <Eviltwin> zzizz: http://jsfiddle.net/Vwu6g/
[10:41:58] <drakythe> Eviltwin: ah nuts, no dice, any other direction you would suggest I look?
[10:43:51] <Eviltwin> drakythe: Not using the Drupal behavior stuff
[10:45:14] <drakythe> Eviltwin: yeah, worth a shot. Alright well lunch is calling, thank you for your help :)
[11:11:50] <thinkxl> http://jsbin.com/ujoqoj/1/edit <- this cause 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Value' of undefined' but I'm getting the data why is returning me an error?
[11:11:51] <bot-t> (226 hours ago) <coldhead> tell thinkxl http://jsfiddle.net/QnpDm/1/ ya hooligan
[11:17:19] <ilyai> thinkxl: access array out of bounds. use stat.length.
[11:18:48] <thinkxl> awesome, thanks ilyai!
[11:19:30] <ilyai> thinkxl: also, array index counts from 0
[11:21:07] <thinkxl> yes but I wanted to start from a middle point of the array
[11:21:21] <thinkxl> I want to avoid the entries already appended
[11:21:57] <thinkxl> so I wanted something like i = keywordsCount ; i < keywordsCount + array.length ; i ++
[11:22:25] <thinkxl> sorry like this: i = keywordsCount ; i < keywordsCount - array.length ; i ++
[11:24:20] <BillCriswell> thinkxl: That seems like a very short loop?
[11:26:03] <thinkxl> BillCriswell: I did it in jsbin as example, but the real array is too long
[11:26:17] <thinkxl> I'm prepending keywords on a table
[11:26:48] <thinkxl> the array updates when a user enter a new keywords so when are already keywords I want to jump them
[11:27:05] <thinkxl> and look for the last ones, and prepend them to the table
[11:27:53] <d0100> Im trying to send a json object as get params via ajax, but I cant make it right, any tips?
[11:29:43] <ilyai> d0100: $.param() should help.
[11:30:49] <track7> anyone here familiar with ajax database html examples?
[11:31:50] <BillCriswell> d0100: $.serializeArray() as well... { fieldname: "value of field" } or [ { name: "fieldname", value: "value of field" } ];
[11:47:24] <Killswitch> Hey guys, I've been fighting for days on this, but I have a jQuery Mobile panel open with a ListView inside of it, and I for the love of me can't get the panel to close when clicking on a page...
[11:47:39] <Killswitch> If I leave the link href blank it works, but not when I have something else in it.
[11:52:29] <madabyss> Eviltwin: You still on?
[11:53:02] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:53:27] <madabyss> Eviltwin: I'm working with the code you gave me. It's working really well. I'm trying to adapt to "fadeIn" images as they complete loading.
[11:53:39] <Eviltwin> Each one individually?
[11:54:42] <madabyss> Yes, initially I needed the script to load big background images. Now, I'm trying to use to load hi-res thumbnails. And, instead of waiting for them all to load before they're preseneted to the user. I was hoping to show them after each one loads
[11:56:52] <Eviltwin> madabyss: http://jsfiddle.net/xepU4/1/
[11:56:54] <Eviltwin> Does that work?
[11:57:50] <madabyss> I'll give it a go.
[11:58:22] <Eviltwin> They're huge images so it'll probably look like it's doing nothing for a little bit
[11:59:02] <Eviltwin> Err
[11:59:59] <Eviltwin> This: http://jsfiddle.net/xepU4/2/
[12:01:17] <madabyss> Eviltwin: Dude, that was it... So simple tooo!! AHHH... Why didn't I think of that earlier.
[12:01:20] <madabyss> Thanks again!
[12:02:11] <Eviltwin> I assumed you wanted to wait for a bunch of them
[12:02:27] <d0100> BillCriswell, yes serializeArray should work, thanks
[12:03:47] <BillCriswell> d0100: Awesome. Forgot I sent that.
[12:06:35] <madabyss> Eviltwin: I do but that was in another case.
[12:07:20] <ctienrsg> I tried to put my jquery ui css in my common css. Why does that not work?
[12:08:05] <ctienrsg> When I use it as inline-style it works.
[12:08:47] <quang> hi guys
[12:08:59] <reed> ctienrsg, "inspect element" on it, it's likely another style overwriting it
[12:09:04] <quang> i am using jquery layout
[12:09:26] <reed> ctienrsg: Inline styles overwrite *everything* else
[12:09:31] <ctienrsg> reed: ok i analyze again.
[12:09:44] <quang> and i am reading in the documentation that when the resize happens it adds a class .  how can i use jquery to do something when this class is added
[12:10:11] <ctienrsg> reed: good to know. my jquery ui has special classes being found nowhere else. But first I follow your advice and look for contradicting rules
[12:10:38] <jgomes> quang: you can't , but you can trigger the jquery on page resize to
[12:11:07] <quang> page resize?
[12:11:14] <quang> im talkin bout the pane resize
[12:11:26] <quang> http://99.14.26.190/
[12:11:28] <quang> thats my site
[12:11:38] <quang> and im using
[12:11:41] <jgomes> yes, you said page resize
[12:11:44] <quang> http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/simple.html
[12:12:02] <quang> naw i said when resize happens
[12:12:13] <quang> but i mean when they move those divider things mostly
[12:12:56] <quang> i need to redraw my chart
[12:13:02] <jgomes> quang: ok, sorry... but is the same answer,,, do it on that thing resize :P
[12:13:04] <quang> when the divider things move
[12:13:15] <quang> well u know i tried that
[12:13:21] <quang> before coming here actually
[12:13:29] <ctienrsg> reed: ok i checked again. no bad rules. the solution is another one. it seems that I can't include jquery ui all inside one script tag
[12:13:38] <ctienrsg> it is valid, but blocks the css I want
[12:14:04] <quang> $('.ui-layout-center').resize(function() {
[12:14:04] <quang>       alert('hi');
[12:14:04] <quang>     });
[12:14:06] <quang> i did that
[12:14:11] <quang> and it doesnt say hi
[12:14:12] <jgomes> quang: let me see then...
[12:14:17] <quang> http://99.14.26.190/
[12:14:21] <colinwren> is it reasonable to use custom html tags for a jquery plugin? My plugin is wrapping text in span tags and iff people are styling span tags then the spans that my plugin creates would get styled
[12:14:30] <quang> that code i just posted
[12:14:39] <quang> the .ui-layout-center is the center div
[12:14:43] <reed> ctienrsg: I believe this calls for a jsfiddle.net
[12:15:08] <ctienrsg> reed: The solution was not to write jquery code between the script tags in which I include the jquery… Classic Error -40. Thanks for your help
[12:15:35] <colinwren> and that could be avoided if I used a custom html tag like <f>
[12:15:39] <quang> actually check now
[12:15:48] <quang> i just got rid of some debugging crap
[12:15:53] <madabyss> Eviltwin: Do you think something like that would work with a div background-image?
[12:16:19] <reed> colinwren: html tags are a specification. "custom html tags" doesn't erally make sense. Use the generic divs and spans, and if you need to style something do it through jQuery or include a css file in your plugin
[12:16:31] <Eviltwin> Not directly, you'll have to use a separate <img> or Image element to do the preloading
[12:16:33] <quang> u see $('.ui-layout-center').resize(function() {
[12:16:33] <quang>   alert('hi');
[12:16:33] <quang> });
[12:16:34] <quang> ?
[12:16:43] <jgomes> is this the plugin you're using?: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/
[12:16:47] <quang> yes
[12:17:09] <quang> but u see how it doesnt play with highstocks good?
[12:17:14] <quang> when u resize the pane
[12:17:20] <quang> it doesnt resize highstock charts
[12:17:23] <colinwren> reed: I am saying that my plugin creates spans and people using my plugin may have styles on  all span tags and so the spans my plugin creates would be styled which is something that they probably wouldn't want
[12:17:31] <quang> until u resize the actual browser window
[12:17:44] <quang> then it will redraw the chart to fit the pane correctly
[12:18:06] <reed> colinwren: right, but that's their fault.
[12:18:30] <jgomes> quang: the resize you're trying to use in the code you posted here, is for window resize... just what I'm talking about earlier...
[12:18:47] <reed> colinwren: Being unspecific about your css is a Bad Thing. Assume your end users are not idiots, and then explain via documentation anything that's not obvious
[12:18:51] <quang> do u see my issue tho?
[12:18:57] <quang> do u know what i should do?
[12:18:58] <jgomes> quang: to do what you want, you need to use the plugin callbacks
[12:19:05] <quang> how?
[12:19:18] <quang> i see it says it adds a css class
[12:19:21] <quang> when it resizes
[12:19:32] <quang> thats why i asked if u can detect if a css class get added
[12:19:33] <quang> or not
[12:19:43] <colinwren> reed: yeah, I was just thinking if I used ccustom tags that i could avoid that completely but that could be confusing in itself
[12:19:58] <jgomes> quang: for example:
[12:20:17] <reed> colinwren: Some/most browsers will ignore things that are not real html tags
[12:20:17] <jgomes> $("body").layout({ resize: function () { alert('resized'); }});
[12:20:37] <quang> will that work?
[12:21:20] <quang> no that code breaks the layout compeletely
[12:21:23] <jgomes> quang: had an error, sorry
[12:21:24] <jgomes> $("body").layout({
[12:21:24] <jgomes>     onresize: function () {
[12:21:24] <jgomes>         alert('resized');
[12:21:24] <jgomes>     }
[12:21:24] <jgomes> });
[12:21:31] <colinwren> reed: thats what i was worried about, Thanks for your help!
[12:21:34] <jgomes> that should work
[12:22:15] <quang> look at it now
[12:22:20] <quang> my layout is gone!
[12:22:56] <jgomes> quang: note that where you read body, you need to put the element o applyed the plugin
[12:23:58] <ctienrsg> Stupid w3c validator finds numerous unescaped characters in my jquery code…
[12:24:00] <reed> colinwren: Snow problem. Might want to check out the concept of "reset.css", and think about including a small css file with your plugin
[12:24:17] <quang> i did that
[12:24:44] <quang> it says initalization error now
[12:24:54] <jgomes> i see it
[12:25:06] <quang> but it does do something when u resize
[12:25:09] <jgomes> quang: you're doing it wrong
[12:25:34] <quang> how?
[12:25:46] <jgomes> after $('body').layout({
[12:26:05] <jgomes> add there the onresize property
[12:26:12] <jgomes> quang: got it?
[12:26:17] <quang> no
[12:26:36] <jgomes> whait then, i'll send you the code
[12:26:40] <Assim_Build> so I'm working on a function to make the divs fill the height of their parent http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/hNM4c/1/ oddly, when you push the reset button the divs dissappear. Any ideas why?
[12:26:45] <quang> $("body").layout({
[12:26:53] <quang> when i do that my layout doesnt even show up
[12:27:24] <quang> u see that?
[12:27:27] <BillCriswell> Assim_Build: You can do height: 100%... right?
[12:27:44] <Assim_Build> BillCriswell: until you get margins and padding and stuff
[12:27:53] <Assim_Build> BillCriswell: not really appparent from the demo atm i know
[12:28:53] <quang> dont leave me yet
[12:28:58] <Assim_Build> also comments on 'good practice' for these two jquery methods (seperate, not one plugin) welcome
[12:29:36] <jgomes> quang: I mean like this: http://pastie.org/7828128
[12:30:05] <quang> thats the way i hae it now
[12:30:20] <quang> it doesnt work
[12:30:32] <jgomes> quang: no its not
[12:30:51] <jgomes> remove secound layout code
[12:30:58] <jgomes> * second
[12:31:36] <quang> i only see 1 layout code
[12:31:54] <quang> oh ok
[12:31:57] <quang> i see two now
[12:31:59] <quang> thanks
[12:32:00] <tomshredz> Hi, I have to make a slider for a client that will look like this http://cl.ly/image/0M0Z2a1h2i3e what's the best plugin I should use that will be 1) not a pain in the butt to use, 2) can use my own css/images? any suggestions? thanks!
[12:32:09] <jgomes> quang: ufff
[12:32:37] <jgomes> quang: leave just the first one
[12:32:43] <Dys> I'm a bit new to jquery; does anyone know if I'm overcomplicating things with this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/eXSM2/
[12:33:04] <jgomes> quang: and replace it with the code I sent you
[12:33:40] <quang> um
[12:33:42] <Assim_Build> oh duh
[12:34:17] <Assim_Build> i set $('div').text('') which would cause child elements to go away as well...
[12:34:20] <quang> ok cool
[12:34:30] <quang> now i got to resize high stocks chart somehow
[12:34:31] <quang> lol
[12:34:34] <quang> idk how even
[12:34:40] <quang> but thanks for setting me up tho
[12:34:55] <ralphholzmann> Dys: needs more vars
[12:35:06] <Dys> More?
[12:35:16] <quang> http://api.highcharts.com/highstock
[12:35:18] <quang> im uisng this
[12:37:37] <quang> well idk how to redraw the chart
[12:37:51] <jgomes> quang: try the redraw method
[12:37:57] <quang> i did
[12:38:01] <quang> it aint do anything
[12:38:57] <quang> do i need to add var chart to the top of the script?
[12:39:47] <quang> i did that
[12:39:52] <quang> but nothing
[12:40:06] <jgomes> quang: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/stock/members/chart-setsize/
[12:41:22] <jgomes> quang: see line 27 (in javascript) it's important!!
[12:41:35] <quang> hmm
[12:41:43] <quang> what is this code
[12:41:47] <quang> it has resizer?
[12:41:50] <jgomes> yes
[12:41:56] <quang> did u make this?
[12:42:01] <jgomes> no
[12:42:08] <quang>  chart = $('#container').highcharts('StockChart', {
[12:42:11] <quang> i have this in my code
[12:42:29] <jgomes> it's in the docs of the hightock
[12:42:42] <quang> but it doesnt do it
[12:42:43] <jgomes> quang: see that's wrong
[12:42:44] <quang> still
[12:42:58] <quang> how?
[12:43:08] <str8uplinux> can someone take a look and see what i'm doing wrong to create dynamic variable NAMES: http://pastie.org/7828183
[12:43:15] <jgomes> well maybe not, let me try
[12:43:21] <jgomes> (like you did)
[12:44:02] <jgomes> quang: it's diferent, just try it
[12:44:46] <quang> i changed it a bit
[12:44:55] <quang> made two parts like the example
[12:44:57] <quang> still nothing
[12:45:44] <jgomes> quang: instead of redraw use this:
[12:46:05] <mathlete> Is it possible to add an onclick behavior to an HTML element so that I can separate my JS from my HTML as much as possible? For example, an HTML element would look like <div id="content">Content</div>, and in my document load, I could do something like (pseudo code): $('#content').attr(onclick, myFunction()) ?
[12:46:16] <jgomes> chart.setSize(
[12:46:16] <jgomes> 	            this.offsetWidth - 20,
[12:46:16] <jgomes> 	            this.offsetHeight - 20,
[12:46:16] <jgomes> 	            false
[12:46:16] <jgomes> 	        );
[12:47:00] <quang> ya i did it
[12:47:01] <quang> nothing
[12:47:15] <jgomes> quang: may not work, caus I don't know what this means in your context
[12:47:17] <quang> i dont think chart is being detected actually
[12:47:30] <quang> i mean i dont think chart is being assigned properly
[12:47:33] <quang> how can i check this?
[12:48:02] <quang> i do
[12:48:07] <quang> alert(chart)
[12:48:10] <quang> it says undefinded
[12:48:13] <quang> is that right?
[12:48:53] <jgomes> onresize: function () {

[12:50:28] <quang> console.log doesnt do anything in my cmd line
[12:50:29] <quang> either
[12:50:36] <quang> console.log(this)
[12:50:37] <quang> rather
[12:51:08] <BillCriswell> quang: console.log() would log to your browsers console.
[12:51:23] <quang> oh ok
[12:51:26] <quang> got it
[12:51:43] <quang> well i got a bunch of ui layout callback errors in that case
[12:52:46] <BillCriswell> quang: Haha.
[12:52:56] <quang> console.log(chart);
[12:52:57] <BillCriswell> quang: What's the first one?
[12:53:00] <quang> this says underfined
[12:53:16] <quang> what do u mean first one?
[12:53:48] <BillCriswell> The first error that's logged to the console.
[12:53:51] <BillCriswell> When you laod the page.
[12:54:28] <quang> error in parsing value for filter
[12:54:33] <quang> declarion dropped
[12:55:31] <jgomes> quang: changed it a bit
[12:55:36] <jgomes> quang: http://pastie.org/7828233
[12:56:33] <quang> ok
[12:56:35] <quang> check it now
[12:56:56] <quang> does it matter that chart is declared in one <script block
[12:57:04] <quang> and then called in another script block?
[12:57:16] <quang> does it have to be all in the same <script tag?
[12:58:28] <jgomes> quang: no
[12:58:41] <jgomes> quang: strange it is undefined
[12:59:14] <quang> well i put it all in the same one
[12:59:19] <quang> and its doing something on resize now
[12:59:24] <quang> but its doing it wrong
[13:00:07] <quang> well
[13:00:09] <quang> i tried
[13:00:09] <jgomes> quang: got it
[13:00:14] <quang> chart .redraw
[13:00:18] <quang> it fix it
[13:00:20] <jgomes> quang: line 48
[13:00:22] <quang> but nothing when i do that
[13:00:37] <quang> wait?
[13:00:43] <quang> i have blank on line 48
[13:01:12] <quang> actually no
[13:01:13] <quang> i have chart
[13:01:38] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's going on in here.
[13:01:50] <quang> well
[13:01:55] <quang> i got rid of line 48
[13:02:05] <quang> and added it the top declaration of highchart
[13:02:07] <quang> but still nothing
[13:03:48] <jgomes> quang: var chart has to be outside document ready
[13:04:00] <jgomes> or just remove the var part
[13:04:36] <quang> ok i did that
[13:04:38] <quang> but nothing
[13:05:06] <quang> i removed var chart; altogether still nothing either
[13:07:28] <TomMan> Hey all, i really could use some help
[13:07:41] <snover> couldn’t we all
[13:07:56] <TomMan> Ahha, fair enough.
[13:09:16] <TomMan> I'm creating an html button through the .after method. But once created, i can't call the .click method for that button. Any advice?
[13:09:45] <wachpwnski> shouldn't jquery be calling .fail and not .done in this case if an endpoint responds with curl: (52) Empty reply from server
[13:09:57] <quang> well chart1 isnt undefined
[13:10:00] <quang> its object window
[13:10:06] <quang> does that mean something?
[13:12:24] <jgomes> quang: http://pastie.org/7828304
[13:14:41] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: What do the headers say?
[13:15:00] <wachpwnski> that is the one line that curl responds with
[13:15:38] <wachpwnski> ok did verbose
[13:15:45] <wachpwnski> getting this over and over: * additional stuff not fine transfer.c:1037: 0 0
[13:15:48] <quang> that messed a few things up
[13:16:54] <jgomes> is the chart on the first line
[13:17:05] <jgomes> put the var part
[13:17:36] <quang> ok
[13:17:43] <quang> well it lags on resize now
[13:17:49] <wachpwnski> BillCriswell: Seems like the api is not even sending headers back, just empty response, shouldn't that go to fail?
[13:18:29] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: Never dealth with that situation before... it would make sense in my eyes.. but there could be reasons why that's not the case.
[13:18:34] <quang> and it seems everything gets pushed over
[13:18:56] <dcherman2> wachpwnski: what's the http response code?
[13:19:39] <muszek> hi... I want to implement a simple filtering - user types some characters in an input and elements that don't have a matching data-name are hidden... I'm trying with a elem[data-name*="'+string+'"] selector, but it fails.  can you please recommend a way of doing it (or perhaps a ready plugin)?
[13:20:40] <wachpwnski> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/chQNWStG
[13:20:46] <wachpwnski> thats all curl is giving me
[13:21:00] <jgomes> quang: remove the third log
[13:21:20] <quang> ok i did
[13:21:27] <wachpwnski> oddly if I make a simple call with ajax on a non complex javascript library .fail does fire
[13:21:32] <quang> u think the fourth on eis lagging it?
[13:21:53] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: Can you make it sends a 400ish status?
[13:22:26] <quang> well u know what
[13:22:38] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: What do the header say for the javascript library? I imagine it would think json and a library probably isn'g valid JSON
[13:22:54] <quang> i noticed if i change the hieght of the browser window itself
[13:22:59] <quang> it redraws correctly
[13:22:59] <muszek> actually I managed to make it work with that selector, but it's not case-insensitive
[13:23:06] <quang> do u think i should do that instead?
[13:23:14] <quang> like change it by one pixel then change it back?
[13:23:19] <jgomes> quang: replace element.offsetWidth with $(element).offsetWidth
[13:23:40] <jgomes> quang: and the same for the height
[13:24:15] <quang> ok did it
[13:24:17] <quang> still same
[13:24:28] <quang> what do u think about my idea?
[13:26:17] <delinquentme> Ok so when attempting to position items relative to one another ... when those items have different parents ...
[13:26:34] <delinquentme> I've just realized that a css of "top":0
[13:26:40] <jgomes> quang: not very good
[13:26:41] <delinquentme> != offset of o
[13:26:54] <quang> ok
[13:26:56] <jgomes> look we're close
[13:27:00] <quang> ya
[13:27:13] <quang> idk why redraw dont work
[13:27:16] <jgomes> the error is here: $(element).offsetWidth
[13:29:15] <wachpwnski> BillCriswell:  how do i get the headers from js?
[13:29:18] <jgomes> quang: try $(element).width()
[13:29:22] <jgomes> and height
[13:29:52] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: Would need to check that XHR business.
[13:30:21] <wachpwnski> I am just finding it on that my complex library does not execute .fail in this case, but my simple script that is just .done().fail() fail executes not done
[13:30:32] <jgomes> quang: please try it... I have to go
[13:30:47] <quang> ok
[13:31:02] <jgomes> quang: wrong
[13:31:08] <quang> says attribte width= nan
[13:31:19] <jgomes> quang:  $(element).width()
[13:31:44] <quang> ok
[13:31:48] <jgomes> quang: not cammel case
[13:31:52] <quang> but it doesnt move it
[13:31:54] <BillCriswell> wachpwnski: Feel like I'm working in the dark here haha. Need more information to really help, and preferable a demo... definitely a demo.
[13:31:56] <jgomes> lower case
[13:32:12] <quang> whoa
[13:32:15] <quang> it does something
[13:32:20] <quang> but it messes it up still
[13:32:35] <jgomes> better
[13:32:44] <jgomes> but still not perfect
[13:32:45] <wachpwnski> BillCriswell: I will keep looking
[13:33:05] <wachpwnski> It's really that the endpoint takes too long to respond
[13:33:07] <wachpwnski> then returns empty
[13:33:15] <quang> ya
[13:33:17] <jgomes> quang: on shrink it doesn't calculate right
[13:33:30] <quang> makes it too big
[13:34:07] <jgomes> paly with that... it's just the calculations...
[13:34:28] <quang> omg
[13:34:40] <jgomes> quang: I really have to go... sorry men
[13:35:23] <madabyss> Hey guys, anyone know a way to invoke Fancybox on something from within a function...?
[13:35:24] <quang> dang
[13:35:25] <quang> it
[13:35:28] <quang> ok thanks for the help
[13:36:24] <jgomes> quang: no prob... sorry for not finishing it
[13:36:29] <jgomes> quang:  bey
[13:37:09] <quang> hey
[13:40:13] <delinquentme> is there any reason a stationary div object would be returning two different .offset().top  values depending on where the operation is called?
[13:45:10] <shellbackpacific> delinquentme: got a code example?
[13:45:18] <shellbackpacific> maybe jsfiddle?
[13:46:10] <reed> delinquentme: It could have moved between two calls, other things could have moved/shown/hidden between calls
[13:46:27] <reed> but yes, fiddle it!
[13:47:15] <delinquentme> is there a simple jquery command to align things on atop another?
[13:47:25] <delinquentme> like centered around the objects height / width
[13:48:00] <leonardshelby84> any idea why this fires the "test1" but then doesn't fire the checkboxToggle() function? http://pastebin.com/tNjRyaPw
[13:48:12] <reed> delinquentme: I think you're on the right track with offset() or position(), jsfiddle it forealz
[13:48:52] <reed> leonardshelby84: You are declaring an on-ready function inside another on-ready function...
[13:49:08] <neataroni> is there a way to listen for fadeIn events?
[13:49:56] <leonardshelby84> thanks reed, but why would the same code work for clicking a link, rather than checkbox?
[13:50:20] <ravenzz> neataroni fadeIn is a function not an event
[13:50:25] <reed> neataroni: Naw, cuz that's an animation, not a jQuery (nor JS) event. You probably want to abstract your fadeIn into a function, and trigger a custom event at the same time
[13:50:56] <neataroni> im trying to trigger something when a backstretched background begins to fade in- i guess i can just change backstretch.js
[13:51:01] <reed> leonardshelby84: Gonna have to rephrase that
[13:51:21] <leonardshelby84> sorry reed, i'll change the script one sec
[13:51:28] <neataroni> ravenzz: good point, i mean trigger an event when fadeIn starts
[13:52:22] <leonardshelby84> reed: http://pastebin.com/MMkfeYmM
[13:52:34] <leonardshelby84> the deleteButton gets fired fine
[13:52:38] <leonardshelby84> the checkbox does not
[13:52:50] <reed> K, checking it out
[13:54:34] <reed> leonardshelby84: I think you want to use click or mousedown for the checkbox, instead of change
[13:54:42] <leonardshelby84> i should maybe explain i'm using it to add handlers to elements i'm creating dynamically
[13:54:55] <leonardshelby84> i'll give it a whirl, thanks
[13:55:53] <leonardshelby84> still the same issue reed, i'm confused because i had this working fine
[13:56:20] <leonardshelby84> so it's firing the event fine, even on dynamically created checkboxes, but then it's not running my user defined function
[13:56:21] <Dys> I'm trying to append each paragraph with its corresponding variable; lines 14 and 21 are an example of what I'm trying to achieve. http://jsfiddle.net/eXSM2/3/
[13:57:04] <Assim_Build> So i'm trying to write my first jquery plugin and I'm a bit confused about how I'm supposed to have data that is tied to an instance of my plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/K6N8p/1/
[13:57:22] <leonardshelby84> reed, got it working, i just removed the  $(function() { around my user defined funcs
[13:57:36] <reed> leonardshelby84: That was my first suggestion :) Glad it worked!
[13:57:50] <leonardshelby84> ahh ok reed, i didn't understand at first
[13:57:51] <leonardshelby84> thanks man
[13:58:03] <reed> snow problem
[13:58:50] <reed> Assim_Build: This is a hard problem. I usually do "this.data('pluginName', 'someData')"
[13:58:55] <Dys> reed: are you good with implicit iteration?
[13:59:10] <reed> Dys: pfff, if i knew what you just said, i'm sure i'd be great
[13:59:20] <Dys> xD
[13:59:24] <reed> :_D
[14:00:05] <reed> Dys: Ah, just looked it up, yes I know that stuff perty well
[14:00:30] <delinquentme> TLDR: we have lots of padding usage
[14:00:57] <Assim_Build> reed: so how would that apply here where I have two seperarate data objects, ones that users can set and ones they can't?
[14:01:14] <KWhat_Work> Hi, this is more of general javascript question but why is the second praseInt required on line 2?  http://jsfiddle.net/nQGqg/4/
[14:01:41] <reed> Assim_Build: To be honest I didn't look at your code thoroughly, that was just my generic answer. I'll check it out in a second
[14:01:52] <Assim_Build> reed: k
[14:05:38] <ctienrsg> someone knows a good plugin that gives me HTML5 datalist functionality?
[14:06:21] <ctienrsg> I want a minimalistic but useful search
[14:08:28] <Assim_Build> KWhat_Work: are you trying to determine if 2^x has the value of the text box in it's result set? if so that code doesn't even work. I'm not sure exactly what it's doing
[14:10:05] <reed> Assim_Build: I don't understand your follow up question here. you can store arbitrary data with .data()
[14:11:52] <shellbackpacific> KWhat_Work: looks like a wtfjs to me
[14:12:12] <KWhat_Work> shellbackpacific: whole lot of wtf ;)
[14:12:15] <Assim_Build> reed: so I have two vars there, data and props, props is everything the user can set, data is stuff I want to have hidden. I'm not sure how to maintain that segregation using data. Perhaps this.data('aquaveoGMap', { data: {}, props: {} })? but that seems a bit awkward
[14:12:26] <shellbackpacific> KWhat_Work: ever see that site?
[14:12:43] <KWhat_Work> Assim_Build: that code simply checks if the number in the box is a power of two.
[14:12:48] <shellbackpacific> http://wtfjs.com/
[14:13:13] <reed> Assim_Build: That, or .data('aquaveoGMap_private', {…}), and .data('aquaveoGMap_public', {…})
[14:13:22] <KWhat_Work> Assim_Build: the wtf moment is that both are ints, yet preforming a bit wise opp yealds incompatible types?
[14:13:45] <KWhat_Work> shellbackpacific: I have seen that
[14:14:09] <shellbackpacific> they both have typeof == "number"
[14:14:30] <KWhat_Work> shellbackpacific: yes
[14:15:08] <reed> KWhat_Work: Definitely a wtfjs moment
[14:17:16] <Assim_Build> KWhat_Work: change the value to 24. 2^x never equals 24 so unless I misunderstand what you mean by a power of 2: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/nQGqg/7/
[14:17:54] <Assim_Build> that is for integer values of x ofc
[14:18:35] <reed> KWhat_Work, Assim_Build: Yes, the check is definitely incorrect. But the fact that it works at one moment and not without the parseInt is still mystifying
[14:19:08] <Assim_Build> reed: I see on the data thing, thanks
[14:19:24] <reed> Assim_Build:  Awesome. Really tough problem.
[14:20:51] <KWhat_Work> reed Assim_Build, its to check memory values, they only need to be a multiple of 8.  Sorry little miss leading buy I was really interested in why that parseInt was needed. .
[14:22:05] <reed> KWhat_Work: Must be something screwy in JS's representation of Number. This is why no one except masochists really hard math with JS
[14:28:31] <ctienrsg> Someone knowing a good search plugin for replacing datalist?
[14:34:42] <dalnet22> when I get an item using grep, is there a way to find out its index in the array?
[14:40:53] <s5fs> Assim_Build: this works for me, I changed how you were checking power of 2  http://jsfiddle.net/nQGqg/9/
[14:41:30] <s5fs> Assim_Build: assuming you are throwing an Integer into the function, anyways. i'm not sure what you were after, but I had fun slapping that together.
[14:45:18] <Assim_Build> s5fs: uh....I wasn't asking how to do it just explaining to someone else that what they had didn't work, who actually wasn't wanting a power of two...anyways it's history
[14:45:51] <Puglime> Hi, I've looked all over for a solution to this ( http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=jquery+select+.change ), but I'm stuck. Given a select menu with a .change event that populates values in other fields, I think I need #first_set_of_options to be checking in with #second, but I'm not sure how. All's well if the user selects things in order, but if they go back and change an option they've already selected, nothing happens to the other
[14:45:52] <Puglime> values. Here's a gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5557629 Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[14:46:25] <s5fs> Assim_Build: yeah, I back-read a bit and see that's the case. thanks!
[14:47:34] <delinquentme> jquery get the css left value?
[14:48:12] <delinquentme> getter method
[14:48:55] <wachpwnski> how do I check if my ajax response data is null?  I tried if (data === 'undefined') i tried if (data.length > 0)
[14:49:33] <wachpwnski> when I call $.each(data ...) i am getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[14:49:42] <delinquentme> nmmmmm
[14:50:41] <Shi> Hi there, do you know a correct class to convert xml into json ?
[14:58:18] <Pereira> Hi
[14:59:10] <Pereira> Guys, isn't it possible to define dynamically a property to be changed in CSS? Like this? http://pastebin.com/9GrRePJN
[14:59:29] <ixy26> Hi.  Question about jquery bind() syntax/use with triggers.  My code's here, http://bit.ly/11Z8arC .  The action's in the functions are NOT triggering when I resize the window; I suspect my bind() stmt is wrong, but just not sure.
[15:07:58] <aaas> my animate() is not smooth in chrome, it just jumps to mabye 90% of the way and then finishes...firefox works ok.... any idea where i can first check
[15:08:02] <aaas> version is 1.9.1
[15:15:51] <fikst> PereiraPT, yes thats possible, but see it as an array
[15:16:18] <fikst> css[json.positionProperty] = json.positionValue
[15:16:34] <fikst> $('#box').css(css)
[15:16:37] <aaas> rrrr..looks to be px v.s. percentage in animate doesn't like px: 0
[15:16:42] <aaas> *left: 0
[15:17:00] <PereiraPT> fikst: gonna try that, gimme a sec
[15:18:51] <fikst> ixy26, if you put the resize handler on the window it should work
[15:22:52] <jim_j> hi, how would you change the iframe src value?
[15:23:35] <fikst> jim_j,  $('iframe').attr('src', 'http://xxxxxx')
[15:23:44] <jim_j> fikst, thanks!
[15:26:03] <ixy26> fikst: hi.  i thought this "$(window).resize(resizeImages).load(resizeImages);" does that.  do you mean something else?
[15:26:43] <fikst> no, thats triggering the events
[15:26:45] <fikst> $('body').bind('resize load', function(e,d) {
[15:26:53] <fikst> $(window).bind('resize load', function(e,d) {
[15:27:06] <ixy26> ah, one sec ...
[15:29:40] <fikst> ixy26, I am not sure the load event will get triggered on window
[15:29:58] <fikst> but resize does get triggered on the window object
[15:31:38] <ixy26> fikst: unfortunately, nada.  imgs src's aren't changed -- either on load or resize
[15:33:53] <fikst> ixy26, http://jsfiddle.net/svaXu/1/
[15:34:01] <fikst> resize the window, and check the console
[15:35:14] <supsup> question: how do i filter out a list of anchor tags based on the hrefs hash value?  http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FqE/  used to be able to use hash filter
[15:35:23] <supsup> hash selector with filter
[15:35:45] <supsup> way way back in dem days
[15:36:08] <fikst> supsup, http://jsfiddle.net/Z5FqE/1/
[15:36:20] <ixy26> fikst: yep, I see it.  *there*.  just not in this in silly 'behavior'.
[15:36:22] <supsup> hurm alright
[15:36:28] <supsup> thanks fikst
[15:36:34] <supsup> guess thats kind of obvious ~
[15:38:15] <fikst> ixy26, in your code, remove the $(window).resize(resizeImages).load(resizeImages);
[15:38:22] <fikst> and add resizeImages()
[15:38:47] <fikst> put some console.log or alert inside resizeImages() to see if the function even gets called
[15:40:05] <fikst> I don't have much experience with drupal, but does Drupal.behaviors.test = {    attach: function(context,settings) { even gets called?
[15:44:03] <ixy26> fikst: it's *supposed* be called; the JS file containing it *is* seen in my ViewSource ... made those changes, but do NOT see evidence of the 'console.log' "resize" output.
[15:50:24] <fikst> ixy26, I guess it should be Drupal.behaviors.test = function(context){} in stead of attach: function...
[15:50:38] <fikst> but, like I said, no experience with drupal
[15:50:47] <ixy26> fikst: I simplified to this: http://pastebin.com/Q5dK0amQ.  In WebConsole, I get a warning: ""The Web Console logging API (console.log, ...) has been disabled by a script on this page)."
[15:53:19] <ixy26> fikst: SUre, that's 1/2 the trouble -- the 'how' in Drupal.  Stuff that works cleanly in jsfillde with 'just' JQ, has challenges "in"  Drupal.  it's *supposed* to be attach (e.g., http://drupal.org/node/1478648).  THat reference requires the presence of the Omega theme ... which has its own additional code.  I don't use the theme, and wanted something much lighter.
[15:55:40] <fikst> maybe you can ask someone in #drupal-support
[15:56:50] <ixy26> fikst: heh, did that.  they keep trying to answer questions you're not asking, and get you to do something you're not trying to do.  then evetually send you here ;-)
[15:59:09] <fikst> ok, :)
[15:59:18] <lasha> anyone know where i can ask questions about InDesign?
[15:59:27] <fikst> so, the resize problem is solved
[15:59:28] <ixy26> fikst: I'm fairly sure I need to figure out what to replace the "bind('responsivelayout'", referenced in that drupal thread, with ....
[15:59:28] <lasha> i received a website design as an indesign file :(
[15:59:43] <fikst> only the drupal problem needs to be fixed now
[15:59:50] <fikst> try something like http://pastebin.com/HGp0Ebyg
[16:00:07] <fikst> to see if the code is actualy run by drupal
[16:05:33] <ixy26> fikst: Ok, I'm gonna have to work at this awhile.  Gonna start with a 'clean' Drupal site, and start adding things one at a time, til I find this.  Thx for the hints.
[16:08:09] <ixy26> fikst: aha.  the simple alert triggers when the page loads! so it's running that behavior ...
[16:09:49] <fikst> alright :)
[16:09:56] <fikst> now lets clean up a bit
[16:10:13] <fikst> http://pastebin.com/qJ8S3w5Q is more logical than  http://pastebin.com/Q5dK0amQ
[16:10:44] <ixy26> fikst: yep, already doing that :-)  step by step.  got the idea, thx!!
[16:14:00] <ixy26> fikst: interstingly, THIS works: http://pastebin.com/0qw1bbjW
[16:14:12] <ixy26> why, exactly do I need that bind?
[16:14:17] * ixy26 scratches head ...
[16:15:25] <fikst> thats actually the same
[16:15:44] <fikst> same like .click() vs .bind('click')
[16:16:06] <ixy26> fikst: hm.  your bind-containing example does NOT work. hmmmmm ....
[16:17:40] <ixy26> fikst: in any case, no need to waste any more of your time.  with your guidance, i found where to 'poke'.  now, to poke!
[16:18:43] <ixy26> thx!!
[16:20:35] <towlie> is there a way to make a post call from jquery to php with post data and have it open in a new window ?
[16:22:17] <fikst> you could trigger a submit on a form
[16:22:24] <fikst> with target="_blank"
[16:27:07] <towlie> but i dont have a form
[16:27:35] <towlie> when you click on an icon, i call a php script by doing window.open("printReport.php",'_blank');
[16:34:19] <greg5green> you basically would make a fake form that isnt displayed on the page
[16:34:30] <greg5green> and then submit that form with your post data in it
[16:38:49] <may68> hello ,, anyone out there can give me a hand .
[16:39:21] <snover> that’s a pretty confident statement
[16:39:26] <may68> lol
[16:39:27] <may68>  :D
[16:39:38] <snover> what if i lost my hands in the war
[16:39:53] <may68>  indeed it is confident
[16:40:38] <may68> "what if i lost my hands in the war" -> Well i would say you are doing a pretty good job typing for a guy with no hands
[16:42:27] <may68> jquery in wp ... does it load on every single page or should I have an if statement for the single page where it will actually be needed ?
[16:42:32] <snover> i have a secretary
[16:42:40] <Dys> Two questions: how do I reset the width so that it doesn't keep compounding every time the function is called, and why does the click function work in the fiddler, but not in the files on my computer? http://jsfiddle.net/ny8Lw/1/
[16:47:39] <fikst> Dys, reset the width before you read it again
[16:47:51] <fikst>  $(this).css('width', 'auto')
[17:31:46] <trinque> can I get the promise object from inside $.ajax(..).fail ?
[18:46:12] <acidjazz> does jquery have built in web socket support?
[18:46:21] <acidjazz> or is it just super easy to use em w/ jquery?
[19:09:21] <shoky> trinque: the first argument
[20:04:35] <Milos|Work> If I call .mouseup() is it possible to add callbacks for when whatever that function was doing, completes?
[20:36:02] <Gazpacho> milos: which function
[21:20:47] <Lann> it seems that IE callbacks cannot find functions which were defined within jquery's scope…is this true?
[21:20:58] <Lann> so if i defined a function within $(document).ready() for example, IE callbacks cannot find it
[21:37:41] <oojacoboo> is tablesorter the way to go, or are there better table sorting plugins?
[21:46:04] <coldhead> people like tablesorter
[21:46:07] <coldhead> and datatables
[21:46:19] <coldhead> they're all much of a shiny sorty muchness
[21:46:38] <rmill> people also like coldheadsorter.
[21:46:56] <rmill> coldhead.sort()
[21:47:55] <coldhead> that does not return consistent results
[21:48:11] <coldhead> hard to write unit tests
[21:48:18] <coldhead> which obviously i do ALL the time
[21:48:21] <oojacoboo> coldhead: yes, maybe much… but needed for reports
[21:48:51] <coldhead> just look at the demos, find the one with the features you can get paid most for
[21:49:27] <oojacoboo> great info in here tonight :)
[21:49:52] <rmill> The more you know™
[21:50:13] <oojacoboo> The more you wish you didn't know®
[21:50:46] <rmill> OH SHI—
[21:51:15] <chee> the more you know the more you wish you didn't know
[21:52:44] <oojacoboo> looks like this is the new project lead fork… https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter
[21:52:48] <oojacoboo> can anyone confirm that?
[21:58:06] <woolie_> I have a few places where I use a variable in a jQuery selector, e.g. $("div[data-name="+name+"]") for convenience. A. Is this a bad practice I should avoid? it seems common in documentation. B. Is there any safety risk -- do I need to always make sure the variables are escaped?
[21:59:18] <oojacoboo> woolie_: I think that's okay, I'm not sure about safety risk, this is client side, security is typically handled mostly server side
[21:59:47] <coldhead> the "security risk" of someone selecting ANY OTHER DOM ELEMENT is probably not going to ruin anyone's life
[21:59:51] <oojacoboo> woolie_: you probably want to use $("div").data() though
[21:59:54] <coldhead> but it sucks to have to select that way
[21:59:59] <oojacoboo> not that awful selector you're using
[22:00:05] <coldhead> far clearer to use classes
[22:00:34] <woolie_> It's a complicated application. I prefer not to hack class names to store state when HTML5 data attributes exist
[22:00:35] <coldhead> you can attach data to elements but you don't want to treat the DOM as a ORM
[22:00:55] <oojacoboo> woolie_: don't use classes then, I'd agree
[22:00:56] <coldhead> if it's THAT complicated you are probably better saving references to the elements in JS and accessing them ther
[22:00:56] <coldhead> e
[22:01:04] <coldhead> rather than searching the DOM by data
[22:01:05] <oojacoboo> speed of selector isn't the end all sometimes
[22:01:34] <coldhead> and turing jQuery into MySQLQuery isn't either :P
[22:01:38] <coldhead> turning*
[22:01:46] <coldhead> go back to work coldhead, you're drunk
[22:01:50] <woolie_> Don't worry, there is no SQL within a thousand miles of my software ;)
[22:02:03] <oojacoboo> LINQ
[22:03:50] <chee> i am a fork
[22:04:04] <woolie_> of what? your parents?
[22:04:06] <oojacoboo> spoon me then
[22:05:21] <coldhead> woolie_: http://jsfiddle.net/fvC4L/
[22:05:39] <coldhead> that's how i'd associate data and elements without having to select by data attribute
[22:05:49] <coldhead> if i were in a hurry
[22:07:25] <woolie_> Use case is when I pass metadata about certain dom elements (that correspond to some part of my application) from my server side templates
[22:07:53] <woolie_> for instance <p class="comment" data-creator="woolie">blah blah</p>
[22:08:08] <coldhead> ah that old chestnut
[22:08:20] * coldhead np: aerial m - wedding song no. 3
[22:10:15] <woolie_> When I have elements that have much more complicated behaviors, I use jQuery-UI style widgets
[22:10:53] <coldhead> this all sounds very complicated
[22:11:30] <woolie_> it's not too bad
[22:12:39] <oojacoboo> woolie_: we do similar things
[22:13:02] <woolie_> actually almost all of my JS code is jQuery-UI plugins
[22:13:03] <oojacoboo> data-type="admin" data-id="123" etc
[22:13:42] <woolie_> oojacoboo: yeah, when I first read about data-* attributes it greatly simplified my life
[22:13:45] <oojacoboo> you're writing your own jquery ui plugins?
[22:14:04] <woolie_> sure
[22:14:16] <woolie_> i have about 35
[22:14:16] <oojacoboo> why, what's the point of using jquery ui?
[22:14:49] <coldhead> without jquery ui sometimes pages load too quickly
[22:14:50] <woolie_> i wrote a few, liked the development style, and it worked well ;)
[22:15:10] <oojacoboo> ah
[22:15:41] <oojacoboo> well, we do use jquery ui b/c we needed some of the things it offers.  Although, I think I'd go with some custom libs now over jquery ui if I were to start from scratch
[22:15:49] <oojacoboo> there is just too much crap in that lib that's just crap
[22:15:54] <oojacoboo> and crap that I don't need
[22:16:12] <woolie_> maybe if I rewrote the entire front end from scratch (again) :)
[22:16:28] <oojacoboo> yea
[22:16:36] <woolie_> it reminded me of writing Qt4 code
[22:16:53] <woolie_> which i was comfortable with
[22:16:54] <oojacoboo> :/
[22:17:47] <woolie_> anyway most of this part of my app is 2-3 years old, i've been refreshing things and doing sanity checks and fixing some long standing issues
[22:21:53] <coldhead> good times
[22:21:57] <paxcoder> $('.C').on('event', handler); should work even if elements of class .C be dynamically added to the page, right?
[22:22:08] <paxcoder> *class C
[22:24:08] <chee> coldhead: when you get a spare minute poison everybody to death in the office on monday
[22:25:38] <oojacoboo> paxcoder: elements of C ?
[22:25:40] <oojacoboo> no
[22:25:44] <oojacoboo> you have to bind it
[22:26:10] <oojacoboo> $("body").on("event", ".C", handler);
[22:26:18] <coldhead> chee: i don't think there'll be anyone you'd personally benefit from the death of on monday
[22:26:38] <paxcoder> oojacoboo, thanks
[22:27:01] <oojacoboo> paxcoder: don't bind it to the body though
[22:27:06] <oojacoboo> find a suitable parent
[22:27:35] <paxcoder> will do
[22:27:43] <oojacoboo> you don't want that C to be a child of the state, it needs a nice parent to adopt it
[22:27:46] <oojacoboo> someone close
[22:28:44] <oojacoboo> someone that can tend to it's needs without having to travel too far
[22:29:16] <paxcoder> yeah, something's still wrong :-/
[22:29:44] <paxcoder> middle-argument selector can select multiple things, right?
[22:29:56] <oojacoboo> .testcase
[22:29:56] <b-ot> oojacoboo: see: minimal
[22:30:04] <oojacoboo> .fiddle
[22:30:08] <oojacoboo> .doit
[22:30:12] <paxcoder> .no
[22:30:18] <paxcoder> .toomuchwork
[22:30:44] <oojacoboo> yes, the selector can selector multiple things
[22:30:53] <oojacoboo> you'll be binding multiple items
[22:31:50] <coldhead> .minimal
[22:31:50] <b-ot> coldhead: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[22:32:03] <woolie_> I think my answer is to use document.querySelector instead of $()
[22:35:07] <woolie_> or escape all the strings
[22:35:09] <paxcoder> coldhead, here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/wXKvC/
[22:35:12] <woolie_> which i'm doing now… brb
[22:35:43] <paxcoder> woolie_, jQ2 outsources stuff to querySelectorAll
[22:39:57] <woolie_> should I always use jQuery.parseHTML instead of $("<div>blah</div>")
[22:41:08] <woolie_> didn't know jquery2 was out, or nearly so
[22:41:15] <woolie_> I spend most of my time deep in the backend :)
[22:41:29] <paxcoder> i'm sure $ also calls parseHTML when appropriate
[22:43:07] <paxcoder> it's not important. it's on the client side.
[22:43:42] <paxcoder> if it were speed you're worried about, you'd do none of that, you'd do createElement('div'), set textContent, and appendChild
[22:44:15] <woolie_> no, not speed, just separating out where I'm using $ for selection rather than element creation
[22:44:38] <paxcoder> why would you?
[22:44:47] <woolie_> my brain is very simple and slow
[22:45:01] <paxcoder> it's very complex :-P
[22:46:03] <woolie_> in the 1 or 2 places where I need better performance, I do use the raw dom methods
[22:46:08] <woolie_> anyway brb
[22:47:29] <coldhead> paxcoder: http://jsfiddle.net/wXKvC/1/
[22:47:36] <coldhead> you had id="#general_form"
[22:47:43] <paxcoder> yeah, just noticed
[22:47:43] <coldhead> instead of id="general_form"
[22:47:52] <coldhead> looks so right, works so wrong
[22:47:53] <paxcoder> i don't have it in the real case
[22:48:04] <coldhead> then what am i supposed to be fixing?
[22:48:08] <paxcoder> so that's fun
[22:48:08] <coldhead> fine, i am getting coffee
[22:48:11] <coldhead> stuff the lot of you
[22:50:46] <oojacoboo> http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/
[22:50:54] <oojacoboo> my god these docs are a lot of crap
[22:55:36] <paxcoder> oojacoboo, any idea how i'd listen for change on dynamically added input fields?
[22:55:55] <coldhead> oojacoboo: file a pull request
[22:55:57] <paxcoder> (given that the parent isn't contenteditable)
[22:57:01] <oojacoboo> coldhead: I'm not going to attempt to touch those things
[22:57:18] <oojacoboo> paxcoder: that shouldn't have anything to do with it
[22:57:18] <paxcoder> gtg..
[22:57:23] <paxcoder> darnit
[22:57:27] <coldhead> you cant complain then :P
[22:57:44] <paxcoder> oh wait, no it's good
[22:57:48] <paxcoder> i prolly had a typo or smth
[22:58:03] <paxcoder> my bad, it's not good
[22:58:09] <paxcoder> i just didn't recompile just now XD
[22:58:16] <paxcoder> (writing in #livescript)
[22:58:28] <paxcoder> keypress registers, change doesn't
[23:00:20] <cwillu> jay, please don't randomly pm people
[23:01:45] <paxcoder> cwillu, why would that bother you?
[23:01:50] <paxcoder> (just asking)
[23:03:55] <cwillu> paxcoder, does it bother you when people randomly call your phone who you've never met, without so much as an "hi, we met at the convention last year, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions"?
[23:04:05] <coldhead> it's channel policy

[23:04:28] <cwillu> hell, only way I knew it was from _this_ channel was from the /whois query
[23:05:11] <cwillu> it doesn't deeply offend me, it's just a rather useless way to start a conversation, especially when it's coming from a support channel
[23:05:25] <coldhead> it deeply offends me that i wasn't targeted
[23:05:39] <coldhead> if he's going alphabetically he went straight past me

[23:06:05] <coldhead> hahahah
[23:06:28] <cwillu> or best of all, no, I don't know carrie, there's a lot of underwoods in the world :p
[23:09:38] <coldhead> that's serial killer elaborate

[23:36:17] <jay> i want to clone city id and the row as many times i change duration value
[23:36:41] <coldhead> thanks jay
[23:38:33] <jay> can @coldhead u help me?
[23:39:37] <MickRip> aww how cute, the font tag!
[23:41:04] <MickRip> jay: I would rethink your approach a little bit because the way you've done things is going to get difficult to manage if you want to change things
[23:43:16] <MickRip> jay: what's the difference between number of pax and extra pax?
[23:43:28] <jay> #MickRip
[23:43:48] <jay> the first row will not clone
[23:44:39] <jay> the second row of city id, city name, night, day ... will be cloned as i change duration value
[23:50:02] <coldhead> this is too complicated for me jay
[23:51:10] <MickRip> jay: I wouldn't use clone. I'd use something like handlebars.  $('.dur').change <-- is that what is not firing?
[23:51:54] <MickRip> or it's firing and not cloning
