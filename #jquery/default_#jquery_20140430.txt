[00:02:58] <Cork> the_last: no it's sibling not child :)
[00:03:11] <Cork> $(this).next()
[00:03:20] <the_last> Cork: oh okay, is children and sibling the same? because children is working
[00:03:30] <Cork> or $(this).nextAll('.y') if there might be something inbetween
[00:03:46] <Cork> the_last: $(this).parent().children() would be about the same
[00:03:57] <the_last> cool :)
[00:04:06] <Cork> the_last: children of your parent is your siblings :)
[00:04:35] <the_last> ohhh, I can use sibling without using .parent(), yeah that's much nicer
[00:05:28] <the_last> thanks Cork
[00:06:22] <Starcraftmazter> so i dont get it, whats the point of draggable's helper
[00:17:29] <oggy729> Cork: Got it...you were right. replaceWith wasn't firing change. New question, however...if I bind the change() to the <select> on ready, it seems to lose the binding after the replaceWith. Does it matter *where* an event is bound in Jquery?
[00:18:43] <Cork> oggy729: if you bind an event on an element that listeners follow that element
[00:18:59] <Cork> oggy729: if you replace it with another element you lose the listeners from the old element (as you replace it)
[00:19:17] <Cork> oggy729: jquery have a method to handle this by binding the event to a parent
[00:19:25] <Cork> and listning for it as the event bubbles
[00:19:53] <Cork> oggy729: this is called a delegated event listener and can be bound with .delegate or .on ( the delegate form of .on)
[00:19:57] <Cork> ?delegate
[00:19:57] <b-ot> Cork: Older/Non-recommended way to do event delegation with jQuery. For new projects, use the second form of .on, .on(event, selector, handler) instead.
[00:19:58] <Cork> ?on
[00:20:05] <Cork> ugg
[00:20:13] * Cork kicks bo-t
[00:20:26] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:21:23] <oggy729> 	else{	
[00:21:23] <oggy729> 		$('#id_trim').change(function() {
[00:21:23] <oggy729> 			console.log("been changed");
[00:21:23] <oggy729> 			getColorsOptions();
[00:21:23] <oggy729> 		});
[00:21:23] <oggy729> 	}
[00:21:43] <coldhead> cool paste bro
[00:21:53] <oggy729> I just rebound it....but is that an OK way to call a named function within an event
[00:21:57] <oggy729> yeah, sorry
[00:22:00] <oggy729> bro
[00:23:10] <Cork> oggy729: you shouldn't rebind events
[00:23:14] <Cork> use delegated
[00:23:32] <HiMax> hello , can you process javascript on cdn server before sent to client browser?
[00:24:00] <Cork> oggy729: ex $('some parent').delegate('#id_trim', 'click', func) or $('some parent').on('click', '#id_trim', func)
[00:24:03] <oggy729> Well actually...the binding doesn't have to happen at all until I change the input from <text> to <select>
[00:24:09] <b-ot> oggy729: No output.
[00:24:32] <oggy729> oh! i see i see
[00:24:34] <Cork> b-ot: hust you unhelp full baboon
[00:24:46] <Cork> *hush
[00:25:35] <oggy729> delegate is much cleaner...i'll use that
[00:33:28] <Elirips> Hello. I'm using jquerys callback-list, but to get the "correct" 'this' in the callback I do something like this: 'var _this = this; $.Callbacks().add(function() {_this.foo(); });' How can I remove such a callback again?
[00:33:32] <zylophone> am i right in assuming that var foo = [{...},{...}]; is sementically correct?
[00:34:20] <anomit> I'm working on creating an html object from a string, and then removing a "p" element based on the class name. This should be rather straightforward but I just can't seem to get it to work. find(".class-name") comes up with an empty object. Ive been up for the past 12 hours so maybe I'm missing something http://jsfiddle.net/LNTJB/3/
[00:35:18] <Cork> Elirips: not sure what that line is meant to do
[00:35:29] <ines> good mrning
[00:35:35] <Cork> Elirips: your not storing the object so can't really use it for anything
[00:35:45] <Cork> zylophone: yes it is
[00:36:53] <Cork> anomit: your searching if the outer most elements in the fragment has a child of type p.name
[00:36:53] <Elirips> Cork: never mind, I found a solution
[00:37:10] <Cork> anomit: and as the outer most element is the only p.name you don't find anything
[00:37:13] <ines> i have a jquery code getting a form data, and i would like to return this data into php
[00:37:15] <ines> http://laravel.io/bin/XLJjR
[00:37:24] <ines> it doesn't work
[00:37:24] <Elirips> I just store the helper function on this itself, so I can remove it again later
[00:37:29] <ines> can you help me please
[00:37:38] <Cork> anomit: use .filter('p.name') to filter out the element from the set that matches
[00:38:41] <Cork> ines: define "doesn't work"
[00:39:25] <Cork> ines: also just use .serialize()
[00:39:35] <Cork> no need for all that code for passing a form to the server
[00:39:49] <ines> i have a table
[00:39:59] <ines> so i need to get data into <td>
[00:40:13] <ines> taht's why i'm coding like this
[00:40:44] <Cork> ines: either way just create an object with key:value pares
[00:40:49] <Cork> and pass that to $.ajax
[00:40:56] <Cork> no need to create the param string manually
[00:41:08] <Cork> especially as your not escaping the values
[00:41:14] <ines> Cork: is there any example
[00:41:19] <ines> please
[00:42:00] <Cork> var data = { quantite: [] }; data.quantite.push() .... $.ajax('url', { data: data });
[00:43:09] <anomit> Cork: awesome you saved me another sleepless hour I guess, I'll buy you a beer
[00:44:13] <randomnick_> hello
[00:45:30] <randomnick_> how can i render rails partial i a given div by clicking a button?
[00:45:57] <Cork> randomnick_: you can't
[00:46:09] <randomnick_> cork why?
[00:46:12] <Cork> randomnick_: rails partials isn't client accessable
[00:46:21] <Cork> so js can't request the partial
[00:46:45] <Cork> you need an action that sends the content to the client
[00:46:45] <randomnick_> damn, dunno what to do now
[00:50:27] <jl2753> Can this be a one-liner when swapping out img src from ajax request?    var imageswap= $(data).find('#image_element').attr("src");             $('#image_element').attr("src", imageswap);
[00:52:17] <Cork> jl2753: no
[00:52:26] <jl2753> Cork: Thanks!
[00:52:31] <Cork> well
[00:53:04] <Cork> wait...
[00:53:09] <Cork> what are you doing?
[00:53:23] <Cork> jl2753: your fetching a full page and grabs just the url from one img tag?
[00:53:58] <jl2753> Cork: No, i'll be grabbing a lot of other elements too, but trying to see if there was a way I could make the code cleaner
[00:54:27] <Cork> jl2753: firstly replace $(data) with var elms = $(data);
[00:54:30] <jl2753> Cork: You actually helped me before by doing a .replaceAll() and it worked, so I've been using that
[00:54:33] <Cork> so you don't parse the html over and over again
[00:54:53] <jl2753> Ah that makes sense
[00:59:05] <Spns790> hello, I am looking at implementing http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/javascript/#rowlink but I can't see what I'm missing?
[00:59:23] <Spns790> I am calling $('tbody.rowlink').rowlink();
[00:59:31] <Spns790> I have the css and js files included
[00:59:46] <Spns790> I've got the <tbody data-link="row" class="rowlink"> in the table
[00:59:58] <Spns790> class="rowlink-skip" on all td's except the first
[01:00:03] <Spns790> I'm not sure what else I need to do
[01:00:38] <ines> Cork: like that http://laravel.io/bin/2zqKE
[01:00:46] <ines> it doesn't work
[01:00:51] <ines> :/
[01:02:55] <Cork> ines: and console.log(data) instead of alert gives you an object with the values you want to send
[01:02:58] <Cork> with the correct keys?
[01:05:15] <Spns790> this is my code: http://pastebin.com/ES1wbMh7
[01:05:39] <jl2753> Cork: What's the right way to use history api for an ajax request? I have this so far but it doesn't go beyond one page back: http://dpaste.com/2H5FNY5/  Am I missing something here?
[01:09:20] <Spns790> any ideas?
[01:09:36] <Spns790> the rows are hovering correctly, the only thing not happening is the whole row becoming a link
[01:12:25] <Spns790> ah... i shouldn't have had class="rowlink-skip" :)
[01:33:27] <zylophon1> when i pull an external file using ajax, how do i then parse it as html so i can use jquery selectors on it?
[01:38:16] <Cork> zylophon1: $(data)
[01:40:02] <zylophon1> Cork: that's what i thought, in the response i have <script id="foo" type="blah">....</script> and $('#foo').html() is undefined
[01:40:21] <zylophon1> uhm, $('#foo', data) that is
[01:40:49] <Cork> zylophon1: ya, jquery does a lot of funky things with inline script tags
[01:41:27] <zylophon1> so, i'm screwed?
[01:41:57] <Cork> zylophon1: what are you trying to do?
[01:43:25] <zylophon1> trying to pull it a handlebars template in an external file
[01:43:34] <zylophon1> apparently the only way is to do it via an ajax call
[01:46:00] <zylophon1> pull in, that is ;)
[01:47:39] <Cork> zylophon1: http://jsfiddle.net/YGe87/
[01:47:57] <Cork> just guessing but that might be what causes your problem
[01:52:43] <jonkristian> Guys, I am using a bootstrap popover to display some form fields, the problem is that these form fields are cloned from head and content class divs so I get duplicate fields, any ideas how i can circumvent this? http://jsfiddle.net/nB4U6/
[01:53:29] <jonkristian> That's the code I am using, except i have input inside .head and textarea inside .content div...
[01:55:19] <zylophon1> Cork: wow - filter seems to do the trick - why?
[01:55:53] <GoSox> If I have a $("form").submit(); event handler, and say this form has more than one submit button, is there way I can determin which submit button was clicked?
[01:56:00] <Cork> zylophon1: your script tag is the outer most element
[01:56:13] <Cork> zylophon1: so you can search for it in the elements as it isn't a child
[01:56:22] <zylophon1> i thought there's no difference between $('#foo', data) and $(data).filter('#foo')
[01:56:37] <zylophon1> ahh, so it's just because it isn't a child of anything that filter has to be used?
[01:56:40] <Cork> zylophon1: '<script></script>' vs '<div><script></script></div>'
[01:56:44] <Cork> yes
[01:56:52] <zylophon1> wow, that's a gotcha!
[01:56:57] <zylophon1> thanks
[01:57:02] <Cork> zylophon1: and $('#foo', data) is a short for $(data).find('#foo')
[01:57:13] <zylophon1> ahh
[01:57:14] <Cork> (the later is explicitly what jquery does internally)
[01:57:19] <zylophon1> thanks once again
[01:57:38] <Cork> np
[02:03:30] <ines> Cork: i used  var dataString ='quantite=' +JSON.stringify(quantite)+'&donnees=' +JSON.stringify(donnees)+'&prix_unitaire='+JSON.stringify(prix_unitaire); but i didn't get my array on php page with this code $donnees = json_decode($_POST['donnees']);
[02:04:16] <Cork> ines: php doesn't expect json in the params string
[02:04:29] <Cork> just set an array to the key and ajax will do the correct thing
[02:04:45] <ines> dataType: 'json',
[02:04:48] <ines> ??
[02:05:00] <Cork> ines: that is what js wants back
[02:05:15] <Cork> ines: and php doesn't have built in json data parsing
[02:05:29] <Cork> you have to do that manually with json_decode
[02:05:51] <ines> that what i did
[02:06:04] <ines> $donnees = json_decode($_POST['donnees']);
[02:06:13] <ines> but no data returned
[02:06:48] <Cork> check what params you generate
[02:07:03] <Cork> but again don't build your params string manually
[02:07:07] <Cork> especially if you send json in it
[02:07:20] <Cork> cause you will generate invalid params like your currently doing it
[02:07:45] <ines> it generate donnees["a","b","c"]
[02:08:03] <ines> whene i show datastring
[02:08:11] <Cork> no you generate donnees=["","",""] and that isn't a valid param string
[02:08:21] <ines> so?
[02:08:30] <Cork> so you can't send it as data as it is invalid
[02:08:34] <Cork> php won't be able to parse it
[02:09:03] <ines> i send it as what?
[02:09:11] <ines> i don't understand
[02:09:19] <ines> :(
[02:09:22] <Cork> ines: like i said before build an object set the key and let ajax handle it
[02:09:34] <Cork> ines: yes cause your sending an invalid param string
[02:10:00] <Cork> your sending donnees=["a","b","c"] but it needs to be donnees=%5B%22a%22%2C%22b%22%2C%22c%22%5D
[02:10:47] <ines> Cork: it doesn't worked with the first solution
[02:11:04] <Cork> ines: again check what the object you generated looks like
[02:11:08] <ines> var data = { quantite: [] , donnees: [], prix_unitaire: []};
[02:11:22] <Cork> don't go do step 1 an 2 and ... step 10 doens't work
[02:11:27] <Cork> you need to check each step
[02:11:32] <ines> ok
[02:11:59] <Cork> and the step should be something like
[02:12:03] <Cork> 1. build the object
[02:12:09] <Cork> 2. check that the object looks correct
[02:12:31] <Cork> 3. send the ajax post and look so the generated param string is correct
[02:12:39] <ines> ok
[02:12:42] <Cork> 4. check that php handles the data correct
[02:12:55] <ines> i'll see and tell you
[02:12:55] <Cork> 5. parse the json in the variables
[02:19:54] <ines> Cork: http://laravel.io/bin/MXQdl
[02:20:02] <ines> error from the first time
[02:23:16] <Cork> ines: you still need to JSON.stringify the array for the object if you want to send json
[02:23:55] <Cork> else you need to change { donnees: [] } to { 'donnees[]': [] }
[02:24:02] <Cork> and it will be a param array instead
[02:24:39] <Cork> ines: or just do data: { json: JSON.stringify(data) },
[02:24:44] <ines> i have disconnected i didn't receive  your msg
[02:24:59] <Cork> http://irc.jquery.com
[02:27:01] <ines> Cork:??
[02:27:15] <Cork> ines: the channel is logged on that site
[02:28:45] <ines> ah ok
[02:29:04] <ines> what is the problem on my code posted
[02:33:19] <Bernardao> hello
[02:34:51] <Bernardao> Can anyone explain me the diference between this two?
[02:34:51] <Bernardao> $('.form_usedcars').on('change', '#mar', function(){
[02:34:51] <Bernardao> $('#mar').on('change', function(){
[02:34:51] <Bernardao> It's working on both and I think the most precise is the first one, but I would appreciate it
[02:38:53] <Cork> Bernardao: the later binds an event to the element #mar
[02:39:01] <Cork> or to be more explicit
[02:39:22] <Cork> the later searchs for #mar and if it is found binds an event listener to it
[02:39:25] <Bernardao> I think both binds an event
[02:39:48] <Bernardao> #mar is inside .form_usedcars
[02:39:51] <Cork> the first one searchs for .form_usercars and binds a delegated event listener listning for event bubbling up from #mar
[02:40:22] <Cork> Bernardao: http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:40:39] <Bernardao> IT's working on both and I know the first one is more precise, but in what meaning?
[02:40:53] <Cork> no the firs one isn't more precise
[02:41:00] <Bernardao> ok, I'm going to read it again
[02:41:02] <Cork> the first one is delegated the second one isn't
[02:41:13] <Cork> that is the only difference
[02:41:32] <Bernardao> thanks Cork
[02:41:35] <Cork> np
[02:43:32] <Bernardao> the event binded is "onchange"?
[02:44:02] <Cork> the even is change some pages call it onchange
[02:44:05] <Cork> its the same thing
[02:45:47] <Bernardao> I understand it now
[02:46:32] <Bernardao> I have added the content, and executing the js once its loaded
[02:48:03] <Bernardao> thats why it's working. But I can load the method ('.form_usedcars').on('change', '#marca', function(){  even before that div doesn't exists in the DOM
[02:48:25] <Cork> as long as .form_usedcars exists ya
[02:48:29] <Bernardao> I'm not sure if I am explaining myself
[02:50:48] <spac> hello
[02:50:52] <Bernardao> $('.form_usedcars').on('change', '#mar', function(){
[02:50:52] <Bernardao> will only work if all that elements "#mar, .form_usedcars" exists when that line is loaded
[02:50:52] <Bernardao> while
[02:50:52] <Bernardao> $('#mar').on('change', function(){
[02:50:52] <Bernardao> will work even if this line is loaded before that elements are added via Ajax
[02:50:52] <Bernardao> I'm I right?
[02:51:57] <Cork> Bernardao: no
[02:52:14] <Cork> that is basically the opposite of how it works
[02:52:19] <Bernardao> the inverse?
[02:52:35] <Cork> the first one works as long as .form_userdcars exist when the event binding happens
[02:52:40] <Bernardao> ok
[02:52:45] <Cork> the last one only works if #mar exists when it runs
[02:53:34] <spac> has anyone done image croping in a popup?
[02:53:47] <Bernardao> and speaking about performance, it's better to load $('.form_usedcars').on('change', '#mar', function(){,
[02:53:47] <Bernardao> because there will be less event listeners?
[02:53:50] <Cork> Bernardao: though that said delegated events is normally best for elements that can exist more then once
[02:53:58] <Cork> so ids are often overkill
[02:54:15] <Cork> Bernardao: not really as you bind on an id
[02:54:22] <Cork> so there can ever only be one element matching
[02:54:30] <Bernardao> it will exists just in one element per page
[02:55:06] <spac> image cropping in a popup?
[02:55:09] <Cork> $('.form_usedcars').on('change', '#mar',...) will bind one event for each .form_usedcars checking if the event came from the one possible id
[02:55:25] <Cork> $('#mar').on('change', binds one event period
[02:55:50] <Cork> spac: not sure what you mean
[02:56:44] <spac> i want http://www.jqueryrain.com/?S4PWDcPG
[02:57:25] <Bernardao> ok, so best option is to use $('#mar').on('change',    once the div is added dinamically, because it will add one event and not looking anything else
[02:57:35] <spac> but with http://deepliquid.com/projects/Jcrop/demos.php?demo=thumbnail
[02:58:15] <Cork> Bernardao: eh... not really you coming at the problem from a weird angle
[02:58:17] <spac> after uploading the image should open in popup but cropping shold be done like its in the secong link
[02:58:41] <Cork> Bernardao: if you dynamically replace the element with the id, then yes adding a static delegated event listener that handles the events for that element is better
[02:59:04] <Cork> Bernardao: but not cause it is less event listeners. it's cause the code becomes cleaner
[02:59:32] <Cork> Bernardao: if you do something like $('.some_class').on('click', func) then YES delegated is better
[02:59:39] <Cork> cause you don't add a ton of listeners
[03:00:16] <Bernardao> the id doesn't exists when the page is loaded. I added it just one time, and if the addition works then I need to add the listener
[03:00:51] <Cork> Bernardao: again that might fall into the second group i talked about
[03:01:00] <Cork> (please read comments you get on your questions)
[03:01:09] <Bernardao> ok, sorry
[03:09:44] <Bernardao> was reading about delegation
[03:09:55] <Bernardao> and now I understand your point
[03:12:44] <Bernardao> the delegated one
[03:12:44] <Bernardao> $('#mar').on('change', 'li', function (){
[03:12:44] <Bernardao> is going to be launched every ime someone clicks on #mar div, while
[03:12:44] <Bernardao> $(#mar).on(change
[03:12:44] <Bernardao> is not going to be checking anything, if in the future someone else makes a click on that div
[03:13:23] <Bernardao> So I have to care about if I'm interested in having a lot of listeners on my page or no?
[03:13:37] <Cork> uh...
[03:13:57] <Cork> Bernardao: no that isn't even close to correct
[03:14:34] <dan2k3k4> e.stopPropagation() doesn't seem to do what I want... got some page that has a few divs with onclick="location.href='someURL';" that I want to pop-up in a fancybox instead
[03:14:36] <Cork> Bernardao: the first one binds an event handler on #mar listning for a change event (that never happens) from li elements
[03:14:39] <Bernardao> argg
[03:15:06] <Cork> dan2k3k4: you can't prevent onclick
[03:15:08] <dan2k3k4> I can do $('.theClass').on('click', function(e) { alert(0); }
[03:15:15] <Cork> dan2k3k4: basically never ever ever use event attributes
[03:15:46] <Cork> dan2k3k4: they exist for backwards compatibility with sites written for dom0
[03:15:59] <dan2k3k4> so what can do with these onclicks? :(
[03:16:12] <Cork> they arn't compatible with modern event listener structures
[03:16:22] <Cork> dan2k3k4: you can do elm.onclick = ""
[03:16:30] <dan2k3k4> ahh
[03:16:31] <dan2k3k4> hmm
[03:16:39] <Cork> or $(elm).removeAttr('onclick')
[03:17:01] <dan2k3k4> I could get the onclick then first, remove location.href and then set the url to pop-up as the modal
[03:17:50] <Cork> or just replace onclick="location...'someURL'" with data-target="someURL"
[03:17:58] <Cork> and do it all with event listeners
[03:18:36] <Cork> $(document).on('click', '.some_matching_class', function(event) { location = $(this).data('target'); })
[03:18:51] <ines> Cork: i didn't succeed on doing it
[03:19:31] <ines> is ther any solution to post array of string on php page
[03:20:01] <ines> Cork:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013728/passing-javascript-array-to-php-through-jquery-ajax
[03:20:03] <Cork> ines: the solution i gave you works
[03:20:12] <Cork> if you failed at implementing it is another matter
[03:20:12] <ines> no :(
[03:20:23] <h3bus> Hi guys, is it possible to extract a thumbnail from a video on the client side with jquery ?
[03:20:36] <Cork> h3bus: not with jquery no
[03:20:40] <Cork> but you can do it with js
[03:20:47] <h3bus> really ? how ?
[03:21:43] <Cork> h3bus: you grab the video and draw it on a canvas
[03:22:28] <Cork> h3bus: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Manipulating_video_using_canvas
[03:24:09] <Bernardao> Cork, sorry I am reading and rereading it and don't understand it
[03:24:27] <Cork> Bernardao: what part is hard to understand?
[03:25:03] <Bernardao> the first one binds an event handler on #mar listning for a change event (that never happens) from li elements
[03:25:03] <Bernardao> $('#mar').on('change', 'li', function (){
[03:25:12] <_biff> hi
[03:25:19] <Bernardao> I think both do the same
[03:25:22] <Cork> Bernardao: well li elements don't fire change events
[03:25:30] <Cork> Bernardao: only form elements do
[03:26:05] <Bernardao> on clicking mar, the event is launched and the checks if li has been clicked
[03:26:16] <Cork> uh no
[03:26:19] <Bernardao> ahhh
[03:26:27] <Bernardao> this was just an example
[03:26:29] <Bernardao> I know
[03:26:29] <_biff> how facebook chat app detect (in browser) if a new message should be display if it is arrived to the facebook server
[03:26:33] <_biff> this could be a simple setinterval?
[03:26:35] <Cork> Bernardao: $('#mar').on('click', 'li', function (){ })
[03:26:36] <Bernardao> only selects, inputs, etc
[03:26:49] <Cork> Bernardao: on clicking any lis inside #mar that handler is fired
[03:26:55] <Cork> as long as #mar isn't ever replaced
[03:27:09] <Cork> the selector inside $() always have to exist
[03:27:45] <dan2k3k4> how would I get fancybox to load from data-target then?
[03:28:18] <Cork> dan2k3k4: i think fancybox has an api you can use
[03:28:18] <ines> Cork: i get the correct  data but  on my php page i don't have nothing: i should do $_POST['data']?
[03:28:23] <Cork> and it creates an iframe
[03:29:15] <dan2k3k4> Cork, ahh I can add 'href' into the fancybox() options
[03:30:06] <Bernardao> you were taling about the form, yes I knew it.
[03:30:07] <Bernardao> But what about this examples, what is the diference? I don't care if it's click or change event
[03:30:07] <Bernardao> $('.form').on('click', 'select#mar', function (){ })
[03:30:07] <Bernardao> $('select#mar').on('click',  function (){ })
[03:30:32] <Cork> Bernardao: the first version binds an event listener on .form
[03:30:37] <dan2k3k4> so would it be something like $('.myClass').fancybox({ 'href'    :   $(this).attr('data-target') });
[03:30:51] <Bernardao> the second one in the select
[03:30:52] <Cork> this listener check is Select#mar was clicked and fires your callback
[03:31:07] <Cork> as long as the form exist the handler works
[03:31:18] <Cork> the second one binds the handler directly on the select element
[03:31:18] <dan2k3k4> or just this.attr
[03:31:25] <Cork> and only works as long as the element is around
[03:31:30] <Bernardao> and about performance it really matters if it's launched by the form or the select?
[03:31:55] <Cork> dan2k3k4: $(this).data('target') or .attr if you prefer that
[03:32:09] <Cork> Bernardao: or this.dataList.target
[03:32:20] <Cork> (the last one only works in modern browsers)
[03:32:39] <Bernardao> I know what is the difference between both, but just want to know which is more "precise/recommended"
[03:32:59] <Bernardao> or best practise
[03:33:09] <Cork> Bernardao: if there was only one answer to that the other one would be deprecated
[03:33:20] <Cork> it depends on the case of what you need to do
[03:33:31] <Bernardao> ok, so it depends on my page!!!
[03:33:36] <Cork> ...
[03:33:42] <Cork> like i've tolde you over and over again yes...
[03:33:52] <Bernardao> ok
[03:33:53] <Cork> *told
[03:34:03] <Bernardao> thank you very much  :)
[03:34:54] <Bernardao> I need to read more about it, do you have any article that could handle it?
[03:35:09] <Cork> Bernardao: i linked you do that...
[03:35:10] <Cork> T_T
[03:35:18] <Bernardao> :P
[03:35:40] <GoSox> if $(this) is an input elelent in a form, how can I select up to the first enclosing form element that i'm inside of?
[03:36:01] <Cork> GoSox: you mean all previous siblings?
[03:36:08] <GoSox> no
[03:36:09] <ines> Cork: i told you that i have the corect content of may array but noting is shown on my php page with $_POST['data']
[03:36:23] <GoSox> i have a .click() on an individual element of a form, not the form itself
[03:36:46] <GoSox> i want to change some attributes of the form itself from there
[03:36:53] <Cork> ah
[03:36:58] <Cork> $(this).closest('form')
[03:37:08] <ines> http://laravel.io/bin/Pd1XP
[03:43:39] <GoSox> Cork: i feel like i've heard that use of .closest() and .find() can be slow
[03:44:02] <GoSox> but, is that only an issue on particularly large pages, or when these are being called rapidly
[03:44:18] <Cork> GoSox: they arn't slow by them self
[03:44:34] <Cork> .find is what basically all selectors run through
[03:44:47] <Cork> and if it is fast or slow depends on the selector not so much the function
[03:44:58] <Cork> .closest just loops around elm.parnetNode
[03:45:08] <Cork> so it isn't by it self slow either
[03:45:14] <Cork> again what selector you give it matters
[03:45:57] <GoSox> and i assume with .find() the amount of tags in side the $(this) matters too right? even if your selector is bad, if you only have 5 tags in there, speed should be a non issue? I would assume?
[03:45:59] <Cork> .closest(".something > .other + div > * + span > .target") yes, that one is most likely slow
[03:46:18] <GoSox> yeah i have nothing like that
[03:46:29] <Cork> GoSox: $(this).find() doesn't do much
[03:46:32] <GoSox> .closest('form') and find("input[type=submit]")
[03:46:44] <Cork> it basically does $(this.querySelectorAll('selector'))
[03:46:56] <Cork> so what speed you get mostly depends on the browser
[03:47:04] <Cork> as long as you stay away from jquery extensions
[03:47:10] <Cork> like :qe and .first and so on
[03:47:18] <Cork> *:eq amd :first
[03:47:20] <GoSox> nope i'm ust using straight up jquery
[03:47:23] <Cork> AND GAH!
[03:47:37] <Cork> GoSox: no i meant that is what .find does
[03:48:04] <GoSox> oh
[03:48:11] <Cork> $(this).find('input') is basically $(this.querySelectorAll('input'))
[03:48:20] <Cork> with some extra logic around it
[03:48:52] <Cork> GoSox: so if .find is slow it almost always is cause the selector is slow in the browser
[03:49:02] <Cork> not much jquerys fault
[03:49:06] <GoSox> ok
[03:49:07] <ines> someone help me  please!!
[03:49:15] <GoSox> Cork: ok you can help that guy now
[03:49:21] <GoSox> i think i'm good here
[03:49:34] <Cork> GoSox: i have tried most of the day... i haven't gotten anywhere...
[03:49:50] <GoSox> *shrug*
[03:49:59] <GoSox> wanna see somethign cool i've made instead then?
[03:50:05] <Cork> shoot
[03:50:12] <_biff> guys, is there a way to autodetect textfile encoding?
[03:50:20] <GoSox> jQuery port scanner http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner/server/
[03:50:35] <GoSox> obviously, the raw scanning is done serverside via a php
[03:50:36] <Cork> _biff: if you mean in js, no not really
[03:50:44] <GoSox> but the "app" came out real nice, i like it
[03:50:47] <ines> Cork:http://laravel.io/bin/Pd1XP
[03:51:02] <_biff> cork yes...aham
[03:51:04] <ines> whene i use console.log(data); it show nothing
[03:51:08] <Cork> GoSox: that is cool yes
[03:51:21] <ines> can you sheck  with me
[03:51:31] <GoSox> Cork: the Ping tool on the site works in a smilar way
[03:52:21] <_biff> Cork so if i want to read a textfile fwith fileapi, should i place an encoding selector next to the fileread button to select and try which encoding would be the best?
[03:52:24] <Cork> GoSox: don't want to run it here though
[03:52:33] <GoSox> fair enough
[03:52:38] <Cork> GoSox: the corp firewall would prob not be too happy :)
[03:52:47] <GoSox> how mad can you get, about a ping?
[03:52:53] <GoSox> a rehtorical question
[03:53:18] <Cork> GoSox: well i never enabled js for the site, but it looksed like it planed to ping multiple ports
[03:53:36] <GoSox> oh the port scanner, yeah that has been known to piss a few people off
[03:54:09] <GoSox> people run it, forget the run it, see the hits in their router logs, and send me angry emails about "hacking" them
[03:54:21] <Cork> XD
[03:55:03] <Cork> then they should put up a public website and see how many bots will troll it with exploit calls...
[03:55:12] <Cork> those are silly amounts >_>
[03:55:39] <GoSox> people bit off more than they can chew when it comes to "do-it-yourself network security"
[03:55:42] <GoSox> bite*
[03:55:55] <Cork> well some do ya
[03:57:01] <GoSox> the worst part is that my server's IP reverses to a differnet domain. so people get extra dumb and don't make the connection. I'm trying to run the ip site off it's own unique IP these days, but certain things, like the port scans, are difficult to get to bind to a 'custom' IP on the server
[03:57:51] <Cork> ya
[03:58:14] <Cork> mihgt be a good idea to change the arpa then
[03:58:36] <GoSox> but i want the server's primary ip to be the one it is, and i want it to point to my other domain
[03:58:37] <Cork> unless you need it for the other domain
[03:58:58] <GoSox> what i need to do is revisit the php port scanner and find a way to get it to work the way i want it to
[03:59:02] <GoSox> even if it's a crazy solution
[04:01:23] <ines> Cork: you would'nt like to answer to me?
[04:20:18] <GoSox> it appears that one of my jquery selectors isn't selecting what I expect it to... and i'm kind of at a loss on how to debug this
[04:20:27] <GoSox> I mean, it's a simple $("form").
[04:22:02] <GoSox> HAH nevermind, a misplaced }); is all it takes
[05:05:41] <TheWhisper> I'm having trouble with my site in IE 9 and previous
[05:05:44] <TheWhisper> and I can't figure out why
[05:05:55] <TheWhisper> www.discoverdan.com/index_wip
[05:06:00] <GoSox> we all are
[05:06:11] <GoSox> i guess I should have made IE10 the only IE I support
[05:06:21] <TheWhisper> The content gets loaded when you click a link
[05:06:37] <TheWhisper> but the function that shows the div containing the content does not run, as far as I can tell
[05:23:46] <brunoais> TheWhisper, Checking...
[05:23:57] <TheWhisper> thanks
[05:25:31] <brunoais> TheWhisper, "I'm sorry, I can't do anything without my elite scripting capabilities." <- LIAR!!!!
[05:25:33] <brunoais> :D
[05:25:40] <TheWhisper> :P
[05:25:45] <TheWhisper> Keep js enabled though
[05:25:50] <brunoais> sheesh...
[05:26:00] <brunoais> just distribute the work between the parts
[05:26:02] <TheWhisper> That message is just a placeholder for now anyway
[05:26:08] <TheWhisper> It is :P
[05:26:16] <TheWhisper> The site works well enough without JS enabled
[05:27:15] <brunoais> Oh ok
[05:27:53] <brunoais> I got the wrong idea, then. sorry
[05:28:11] <TheWhisper> :P
[05:28:49] <_biff> [14:27] <_biff> what should i change on fileselector if i want to open a file not only onchange but always if i select the same file...
[05:28:53] <_biff> [14:27] <_biff> i use now onchange...
[05:29:00] <_biff> onclick?
[05:32:42] <brunoais> TheWhisper, it semes it's about a method that is being tried to be executed
[05:32:50] <TheWhisper> what method?
[05:33:06] <brunoais> hasClass
[05:33:14] <brunoais> the weird part is that it is a jQuery method
[05:33:24] <brunoais> it just says that the method does not exist on the object
[05:33:35] <brunoais> It's in the checkSize function
[05:33:39] <TheWhisper> hrm
[05:33:45] <TheWhisper> but that only runs on resize, no?
[05:34:09] <brunoais> I dunno
[05:34:12] <brunoais> I didn't test that far
[05:34:18] <brunoais> I only tried to reproduce what you told
[05:34:39] <TheWhisper> hm
[05:34:46] <brunoais> TheWhisper, I was unable, though, to reproduce in IE9, only IE8
[05:34:47] <TheWhisper> People say console.log() breaks jquery in IE
[05:34:54] <brunoais> that's off
[05:34:58] <brunoais> *odd
[05:35:03] <TheWhisper> I dunno
[05:35:12] <TheWhisper> I have some other stuff I need to work on right now, unfortunately
[05:35:32] <brunoais> TheWhisper, why are you using jQuery migrate, BTW?
[05:35:49] <TheWhisper> I started on 1.7.2
[05:35:56] <TheWhisper> and then switching to 1.10
[05:35:58] <TheWhisper> *switched
[05:36:06] <TheWhisper> and some stuff didn't work
[05:36:12] <TheWhisper> so I used migrate, and it works
[05:37:58] <brunoais> TheWhisper, try fixing those first
[05:38:02] <brunoais> then remove the migrate
[05:38:10] <brunoais> then try again on IE8 and such
[05:38:12] <TheWhisper> hm
[05:38:13] <TheWhisper> okay
[05:38:18] <TheWhisper> No time now though
[05:38:26] <brunoais> it can be (although unlikely) that migrate is making it break
[05:39:11] <brunoais> migrate also warns you about what it is fixing. When you get no warnings from it, it should be safe to remove it
[05:43:37] <Fluxblux> Hi. is it possible to set an attribute value in jquery by assigning the value using '='  instead of supplying it as function parameter to .attr() ?
[05:43:50] <Cork> Fluxblux: no
[05:44:43] <Fluxblux> aaaw. I hate assigning stuff using that kind of function notation... ("attr", value)
[05:45:16] <Cork> Fluxblux: well you can do something like elm.<property> = val if you prefer
[05:45:33] <Cork> but then your not setting attributes, and your not using jquery
[05:46:01] <Cork> Fluxblux: you can set it like attr({ attr: value })
[05:46:04] <Cork> if you prefer that
[05:46:15] <brunoais> Fluxblux, for attr you are stuck there. Still, for the prop() you can just assign using the '=' in the DOM object
[05:52:35] <Fluxblux> Cork: hmm I'm never seen that elm.<property> notaiton before. how would you use that? can't even get it working when playing around in the console :P
[05:52:58] <Fluxblux> brunoais: ,from what I can tell prop is used like this: .prop("propname", value) , haven't seen any examples with '='
[05:53:14] <Cork> Fluxblux: it is now dom works
[05:53:33] <Cork> $(this).prop('name', 'something') => this.name = 'something':
[05:53:35] <Cork> *;
[06:01:16] <Ansikt> Hi.
[06:01:31] <Ansikt> How do I add and remove items from jQuery collections?
[06:02:22] <decx> add to add, slice to remove
[06:03:18] <shout_user> hello o/
[06:03:25] <shout_user> oh, damn
[06:03:38] <decx> HELLO USER SHOUT_USER
[06:03:47] <erming_> meh! :>
[06:04:04] <Ansikt> Thanks - didn't know about slice.
[06:11:56] <Cork> Ansikt: you can also use .not() and .filter()
[06:14:11] <Macaveli> Can you write this better? "$("#application_source").parent().parent().parent().parent()"
[06:14:29] <decx> closest('.myparent')
[06:15:58] <bberry> lol..
[06:19:10] <erming_> $('#element').parents().eq(3); is another way to do it
[06:19:15] <Macaveli> Thanks decx
[06:19:18] <Macaveli> and erming_
[06:19:42] <erming_> but closest are better, in my opinion.. because then you can add more parents if you'd like, without breaking the code
[06:25:19] <Macaveli> I have to hide multiple things it is possible to create a nice function for this?
[06:25:33] <Macaveli> like foo(hide) or foo(show)
[06:25:39] <Macaveli> something like that?
[06:25:53] <erming_> is it possible? yes
[06:26:03] <erming_> you can do it however you want
[06:26:15] <decx> $.fn.hide() and $.fn.show() ^^
[06:26:24] <Macaveli> Yes i know
[06:26:30] <Macaveli> but I need to do like 20
[06:26:31] <erming_> but lets say i want to hide lots of stuff with jQuery, i'd use a selector like this: $("#box-1, #box-2, .random").hide();
[06:26:42] <Macaveli> ash that's an option
[06:27:11] <erming_> and of course, you could just create a normal function, and put all types of magic inside it
[06:28:11] <EdwardIII> hey, simple problem, i'm trying to handle a 500 error response on a promise, but .fail doesn't seem to trigger
[06:30:35] <EdwardIII> on $.ajax it seems to be .error(), but a promise deferred object doesn't seem to have .error()
[06:30:39] <jklaus> hey guys
[06:30:56] <jklaus> anyone here familiar with jquery DataTables - TableTools?
[06:31:29] <jklaus> Fiddler is showing the swf comes in with a 200 so it seems like the file is there
[06:31:45] <jklaus> however, the buttons do not work
[06:32:12] <jklaus> the export buttons that is, print works fine
[06:32:20] <jklaus> I've also added a custom button which works fine
[06:35:38] <Cork> EdwardIII: it's .done and .fail
[06:35:42] <xec> EdwardIII: server error should trigger .fail()
[06:36:16] <xec> assuming the server does indeed send the 500 http response
[06:36:17] <EdwardIII> hrm for me it doesn't seem to be triggering fail
[06:36:37] <EdwardIII> ah, looks like i've just got a simple error here
[06:36:41] <EdwardIII> checking the wrong call i think
[06:36:43] * EdwardIII tries again
[06:42:28] <mightyiam> Hi! Can anyone please clarify: What is the order of the merges that are being done in $.extend(), please?
[06:44:42] <BillCriswell> mightyiam: Everything is added to the first argument.
[06:44:54] <BillCriswell> Left to right.
[06:46:04] <mightyiam> BillCriswell, I would have guessed left to right as well. Does it override existing values?
[06:46:22] <GoSox> What is a good event to use on a <textarea>? I want to trigger any time the contents change, so any keystroke or delete, plus if possible, I and to trigger when text is pasted in via keyboard shortcut or menu bar paste
[06:46:41] <BillCriswell> mightyiam: Yes.
[06:46:44] <mightyiam> Thank you very much BillCriswell
[06:47:05] <xec> GoSox: "input"
[06:48:23] <GoSox> xec: is that even a thing? i'm googling and finding nada
[06:48:49] <xec> GoSox: yes, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/input
[06:49:12] <xec> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/BgWP6/
[06:49:51] <GoSox> yup definitely works, in safari anyway
[06:50:24] <ines> http://laravel.io/bin/9709z
[06:50:28] <ines> please help
[06:50:34] <ines> i' trying to post array
[06:50:48] <ines> but it post only the last value of each array
[06:50:57] <ines> anyone know whay
[06:56:32] <Macaveli> Can you do a select on this "<label for="privacy">"
[06:56:40] <Macaveli> so a label with a for
[06:57:16] <GoSox> $("label[for=id]")
[06:57:22] <GoSox> but i wouldn't do it that way
[06:57:37] <prtksxna> GoSox: How would you then?
[06:57:40] <Macaveli> GoSox, why not?
[06:58:02] <GoSox> well, what exactly are you trying to select the label for in the first place?
[06:58:19] <GoSox> also i don't use 'for' attributes in my labels at all, i just wrap the label around the input
[06:58:57] <prtksxna> But isn't that what the `for` attribute is for?
[06:59:18] <GoSox> you can use it, but its easier and takes fewer bytes to just wrap the label around the input
[06:59:34] <GoSox> for example, the radio buttons on this page: http://www.whatsmyip.org/string-encoder-decoder/
[07:00:08] <decx> yeah, like i'm gonna add ids to all my inputs, what am i, the dmv?
[07:00:26] <prtksxna> GoSox: Does it still functions the same way though?
[07:00:32] <GoSox> yup
[07:01:44] <prtksxna> GoSox: Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks :)
[07:04:10] <GoSox> save bytes! they add up
[07:09:05] <xec> i actually had to fix a bug i introduced using wrapped <label>s today
[07:09:16] <GoSox> what kind of bug/
[07:09:36] <xec> i had a list of things that can be removed (uncheck = remove)
[07:09:44] <xec> and i had an edit mode on the page
[07:10:09] <xec> so when the edit mode is off, i only showed the checked items, and hid the rest, and hid the checkboxes
[07:10:36] <xec> but they could still be unchecked because they were unchecked when you clicked them.. duh
[07:11:26] <xec> so now i hide the entire label and show another element with the item instead
[07:11:49] <xec> edge case for sure, just thought i'd share. because i'm bored. ;)
[07:12:38] <ines> any one answer myyyy
[07:12:59] <ines> i'm looking for help hear
[07:13:04] <GoSox> still?
[07:13:10] <ines> yeahhh
[07:13:12] <GoSox> you could have read a whole book on jQuery by now
[07:13:40] <ines> why
[07:13:51] <xec> to learn jquery
[07:14:00] <xec> </smartass>
[07:14:03] <ines> i have posted my code
[07:14:20] <ines> and psted my question
[07:14:22] <xec> ines: what makes you feel entitled to free help?
[07:14:54] <ines> i don't konw i'm asking question and noone answer
[07:15:10] <ines> my code seems correct
[07:15:13] <GoSox> to get help in IRC, you have to ask narrow, specific questions. break it into small bites, so even lazy people can help you
[07:15:21] <ines> i need just a 5min
[07:15:27] <GoSox> and try to have unique problems so its interesting for people to help you
[07:15:34] <slax0r> no, you're not asking for help
[07:15:39] <slax0r> you're asking for someone to fix your code
[07:15:47] <slax0r> debug it, see where it goes wrong
[07:16:02] <slax0r> maybe you'll understand on your own why that specific part of the code is producing wrong results
[07:16:05] <slax0r> if not, you ask
[07:16:15] <ines> you can't debug it cause ther is no html code
[07:16:20] <slax0r> you don't paste all of your code, now fix my shit bi***s
[07:16:48] <xec> ines: also, make a demo that does something close to what you want, let us know exactly what is and isn't working
[07:16:53] <ines> i'm asking about the post of an arry to php page
[07:16:54] <slax0r> if the code is not debugable, you discovered your first issue
[07:17:26] <slax0r> I don't care, I opened your paste and closed it
[07:17:34] <slax0r> I don't want to dig through 100 lines of code for you
[07:17:34] <ines> you didn't see my problem ti juge me!!!
[07:17:52] <slax0r> no one is judging you
[07:18:16] <xec> ines: i can see you're frustrated. take a step back and a short break.
[07:18:26] <slax0r> just trying to get you to debug your own code, or at least make an example of what goes wrong as xec already suggested
[07:18:41] <GoSox> have you guys worked with webworkers?
[07:18:46] <slax0r> http://jsfiddle.net/
[07:18:51] <ines> i do that from the mrning right now
[07:18:54] <GoSox> i read about them today, sounds a lot like... setTimeout()
[07:19:10] <slax0r> ines: take a break...really...
[07:19:19] <slax0r> take 5 minutes off, it will do miracles
[07:19:32] <ines> :(
[07:22:46] <slax0r> GoSox: seems to me that a webworker is a "separate thread" in javascript
[07:22:52] <slax0r> so nowhere near similar to timeout
[07:23:17] <GoSox> i thought that was very similar to what setimeout is... or at least what you get when you use settimeout with a 1ms timeout
[07:23:27] <GoSox> you essentially break out a piece of code into its own thread, more or less?
[07:24:43] <ines> i can ask my question know?
[07:25:05] <ines> xec
[07:25:54] <xec> ines: did you make a demo that illustrates your issue?
[07:26:11] <slax0r> GoSox: don't think timeout makes a new thread, only prolongs the execution of a piece of code
[07:26:16] <slax0r> however, if it does
[07:26:21] <slax0r> timeout still has access to the dom
[07:26:25] <slax0r> web worker doesn't
[07:26:28] <GoSox> hmm
[07:27:13] <ines> xec: my aim is to get data from html table, i'm getting it correctly with each function
[07:27:16] <GoSox> ocde in a settimeout runs a asynchronously, so you can at least simulate multithreaded ness by having a bunch of functions running at the same time
[07:27:37] <ines> xec: i have 3 arrays and need now to post them to php file
[07:27:42] <ines> xec: all right?
[07:28:23] <StanAccy> Is there a common way to have popup divs on either hover or click (since hover doesnt work on most phones/tables).  Id also like the popup to stay popped up if the element was clicked (so hover shows the div until mouse off, but a click leaves the div popped up until click-off)
[07:28:27] <drej> ines you havent posted the link to your demo / testcase yet?
[07:28:43] <ines> http://laravel.io/bin/9709z
[07:29:04] <slax0r> GoSox: yeah, but afaik, if a settimeout piece of code takes too long to execute, you would also get that dreadfull "kill page" popup in the browser
[07:29:05] <ines> drej: i cant post all my code since i'm working a plugin wordpress
[07:29:10] <slax0r> with web worker this should not happen
[07:29:11] <slax0r> afaik
[07:29:22] <GoSox> hmmmm
[07:29:29] <slax0r> I might be mistaken tho, I'm not exactly a JS speciallist :D
[07:29:47] <GoSox> i have a job that webworkers might be ideal for
[07:29:59] <GoSox> better than settimeout even
[07:30:24] <GoSox> although i'll have to test, settimeout could actually make things easier since it's still running and able to control the dom
[07:31:11] <slax0r> set timeout should mostly be used for things that need to happen with an offset
[07:31:14] <ines> xec:drej
[07:31:17] <slax0r> like, a user comes on the site
[07:31:36] <slax0r> and after 500ms you want to display a popup i.e. if you are that evil and bombard your users with those
[07:31:57] <slax0r> while web workers would be used to crunch data, like image manipulation i.e.
[07:32:05] <slax0r> which take long(er) to execute
[07:32:28] <slax0r> and operations that you can send the data in as parameters and retreive back the result as output parameters
[07:32:42] <slax0r> like, calculating pi to 1 millionth decimal i.e.
[07:32:48] <slax0r> or 100 millionth
[08:00:04] <dazaweb> With datepicker, my users select a date. They submit their date to a confirmation page. They can choose to navigate back to the page and I populate the input value with their selected date. That part I have working. However, if I select a date the input doesn't update with the selected date. I added altField, but that defaults to today's date. Any suggestions?
[08:18:33] <bberry> is Array.prototype.find ever going to conflict with $(selector).find()?
[08:19:56] <dcherman> bberry: no, those are two different prototypes.
[08:21:47] <bberry> k. i wasnt sure if $(selector) could ever have an array prototype up the prototype chain
[08:32:40] <guyz> I'm trying to get the window width using $(window).width(); but it's returning 1440px when it's actually 1425px
[08:33:17] <brunoais> guyz, try using the <html> instead of window
[08:33:24] <BillCriswell> I think a scroll bar is about 15px wide.
[08:33:42] <brunoais> Oh yeah, it can also be that
[08:33:52] <bberry> that pesky scroll bar
[08:33:55] <brunoais> guyz, are you sure you need that data?
[08:33:58] <bberry> always gets ya
[08:35:05] <guyz> brunoais, i do need to know the width so i can place a fixed element based on the site container (essentially taking window width minus site container, divided in half, then placing a fixed element on the outside left of the site)
[08:35:14] <bberry> why is it that browsers restrict modification of scrollbars, select menus, file type inputs, etc?
[08:35:48] <bberry> guyz: this sounds like it could be solved w/ css
[08:35:49] <brunoais> guyz, why not just use CSS?
[08:37:11] <guyz> cant work in css because it slides out over the container; and when done in css it gets the problem where the invisible div overlays the content (making it non-clickable) and the css fix for that stops the element from being clicked to go to it's landing page
[08:41:31] <brunoais> guyz, use z-index
[08:41:46] <dazaweb> With datepicker, my users select a date. They submit their date to a confirmation page. They can choose to navigate back to the page and I populate the input value with their selected date. That part I have working. However, if I select a date the input doesn't update with the selected date. I added altField, but that defaults to today's date. Any suggestions? https://gist.github.com/bungdaddy/4be947e6ebabdf78544b
[08:42:10] <brunoais> guyz, otherwise you basically are doing it wrong and you are tyring to patch it using js
[08:42:41] <brunoais> dazaweb, not me :/
[08:42:53] <brunoais> dazaweb, try making a jsfiddle of it
[08:48:18] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[08:48:35] <Bloomberg> Someone know some plugin for manage file by tree index ?
[08:48:44] <Bloomberg> something like in dropxbox
[08:49:51] <duch_kazatel> gooood morning #jquery
[08:50:04] <bberry> Bloomberg what does that mean
[08:50:39] <BillCriswell> Mornin'.
[08:51:14] <brunoais> GOOOOOD morning duch_kazatel!
[08:51:22] <brunoais> feeling better today :) \o/?
[08:52:28] <duch_kazatel> eh.  still in a funk.  doing better though - pushed a pretty big project to our QA and Code Review processes last night.
[08:55:25] <repxl> why $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, "slow");  don't scroll my page to the top after ajax success
[08:56:27] <duch_kazatel> repxl are you getting an error in the console?
[08:57:39] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok works i needed to press F5
[08:57:47] <duch_kazatel> well ok.
[08:58:13] <nownot> any thoughts on takeing a div (html + css) and creating a pdf from it?
[08:58:46] <brunoais> noaXess, using javascript?
[08:58:48] <brunoais> ups
[08:58:54] <brunoais> nownot, using javascript?
[08:59:15] <duch_kazatel> nownot sure - phantomjs
[08:59:15] <nownot> brunoais: looking for soemthing that works. but js is ideal since its client side and wont need a server componenet
[08:59:22] <duch_kazatel> ah nvm.
[08:59:50] <brunoais> nownot, try asking mozilla
[08:59:57] <nownot> duch_kazatel: looked at phanton, but couldn’t find a good example on div -> pdf from js, everything was command line
[09:00:02] <brunoais> they usually get those crazy (but useful) ideas
[09:00:20] <MikeD_> should I be proactively managing event handlers connected to DOM elements that get destroyed and rebuild?  (memory leakage, esp. IE)
[09:00:20] <jklaus> If anyone can tell me why the export functionality isn't working I'll give you my first born son.     http://live.datatables.net/wadafof/1/edit
[09:00:29] <brunoais> for the server, there's loads of libs you can use
[09:00:35] <MikeD_> jklaus: no thanks, not hungry
[09:00:43] <nownot> duch_kazatel: if you can find me, or point me in teh right direction for div->pdf I’d appreciate it
[09:00:48] <brunoais> jklaus, no thanks. 5 is enough
[09:00:55] <jklaus> lol
[09:01:05] <nownot> brunoais: yeah?
[09:01:13] <jklaus> Any chance someone can take a look anyway.. I'm stumped and have been looking at this for a long time now
[09:01:22] <brunoais> nownot, try asking mozilla. I'm not kidding
[09:01:42] <duch_kazatel> nownot you wanted a client-side setup, right?
[09:01:44] <brunoais> jklaus, I'll take a look
[09:01:48] <jklaus> the print button works, none of the others do
[09:02:06] <nownot> duch_kazatel: preferred, but would like to get something working at this point so severside isnt out of the question
[09:02:08] <jklaus> Copy, CSV, Excel, PDF - all broken
[09:02:25] <MikeD_> i didn't see any code that would make them work
[09:02:27] <duch_kazatel> nownot phantomjs is easy, but you have to feed it an entire page last i checked
[09:02:37] <duch_kazatel> it might let you select apart of it though.
[09:02:56] <nownot> duch_kazatel: ahh I rememver the problem with phantom, using node, so it doesnt like my auth scheme
[09:02:58] <brunoais> jklaus, CBA. I don't know that plugin and not enough time. sorry.
[09:03:01] <nownot> it only prints the login page
[09:03:06] <nownot> even though I’m auth’d
[09:03:07] <GoSox> So how do I debug a script that isn't working, but only in IE9? And it's not throwing any errors to the console
[09:03:13] <duch_kazatel> nownot fair enough.
[09:03:29] <jklaus> blast, thanks anyway brunoais
[09:03:40] <jklaus> anyone else able to help me out?  I'm stuck...
[09:03:40] <brunoais> jklaus, :|
[09:03:55] <brunoais> GoSox, test to see the execution path?
[09:04:05] <GoSox> what does that mean?
[09:05:35] <brunoais> GoSox, well... looks like it's a lack of funcitonality bug and not an exception. Then it means that you are not doing something you should be doing
[09:05:56] <brunoais> GoSox, without more info, I can't help you anymore on that
[09:06:07] <duch_kazatel> GoSox you use the debugger and step through it.
[09:06:15] <GoSox> looks like it's the selector bug. Where as far as CSS/jQ selectors are concerned, the form elements are located outside of the form,e ven though they are not
[09:06:32] <duch_kazatel> GoSox are you sure the page is valid
[09:06:32] <duch_kazatel> ?
[09:06:36] <GoSox> yup
[09:07:45] <brunoais> GoSox, sure sure? Did you test it on the w3c validator?
[09:07:46] <GoSox> when i put a border around the form element, it reveals a zero height block element, and all of the form elements are on the page after/below the form
[09:07:53] <GoSox> brunoais: yes i did
[09:08:09] <GoSox> feel free to double-test
[09:08:10] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/string-encoder-decoder/
[09:08:20] <brunoais> wrong link?
[09:08:32] <GoSox> right link
[09:08:53] <duch_kazatel> so what am I testing on this page again?
[09:09:05] <GoSox> any of the forms, in IE9
[09:09:10] <GoSox> they all work everywhere else
[09:09:29] <brunoais> GoSox, so... you are one of the devs of whatsmyip?!?!
[09:09:32] <GoSox> in IE9, no styles and no jquery selectors that go through the form tag
[09:09:39] <GoSox> brunoais: i am the only dev of whatsmyip.org
[09:09:44] <brunoais> Oh
[09:09:55] <brunoais> loads of ppl get there through me...
[09:10:04] <GoSox> cool
[09:10:06] <GoSox> keep it up!
[09:10:06] <brunoais> you should be loaded with traffic
[09:10:09] <brunoais> ^^
[09:10:17] <duch_kazatel> interestiling problem.
[09:10:18] <brunoais> they don't know a different way to see their IP
[09:10:31] <brunoais> ok, back to the subject...
[09:10:40] <GoSox> duch_kazatel: i've had it on other pages on this site. not all the time. i haven't been able to figure out what cuases it
[09:11:16] <GoSox> i really don't feel like re-doing all of my selectors, adding classes and id's directly to each form element
[09:11:28] <brunoais> GoSox, Hum...
[09:11:36] <brunoais> which selector do you believe to be failing?
[09:11:45] <GoSox> every selector that goes through "form"
[09:11:50] <GoSox> in CSS and jQuery
[09:11:58] <GoSox> ".string_encoder form > div" for example
[09:12:16] <GoSox> because IE9 immediatly closes the form tag as soon as you open it, so everything that is inside the form, gets renders as outside of it
[09:12:19] <GoSox> and my selectors fail
[09:12:23] <GoSox> ONLY IN IE9
[09:12:30] <brunoais> that's weird, though
[09:12:35] <brunoais> I didn't know about such bug
[09:12:44] <duch_kazatel> GoSox that form doesn't look valid to me - I'm seeing an unclosed <p> in them.
[09:12:56] <GoSox> you don't have to close <p> tags
[09:13:11] <GoSox> run it through the validator, it is fully valid
[09:13:21] <duch_kazatel> this is IE9.  have you tried?
[09:13:31] <GoSox> yes
[09:15:22] <duch_kazatel> this is what I'm seeing: http://i.imgur.com/sWzFtXg.png
[09:15:25] <duch_kazatel> that's why i ask.
[09:15:33] <duch_kazatel> 9 is rendering it very oddl.
[09:15:35] <duch_kazatel> *oddly
[09:15:45] <GoSox> even deleting the Ps all together doesn't fix it
[09:15:57] <GoSox> yes that is what it's doing, its closing the form tag all by itself
[09:16:01] <brunoais> ...
[09:17:31] <brunoais> GoSox, try explicitely closing the <p> tag
[09:17:36] <duch_kazatel> it's closing the form tag because 9 thinks the page is not valid.
[09:17:45] <GoSox> how do you know this?
[09:17:48] <GoSox> and does it say why?
[09:18:21] <duch_kazatel> I know this because the rendered output is different than the actual markup, and it's because IE9 is stupid and thinks your page is invalid.
[09:18:22] <GoSox> the validator in the IE9 dev tools just forwards you to w3c which validates it
[09:19:02] <brunoais> yeah, true. the w3c validator validates it
[09:19:33] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet you're hitting a browser quirk in this case.
[09:20:46] <duch_kazatel> i don't care what the w3c says in this case, I care what IE9 thinks it's doing.
[09:20:54] <brunoais> GoSox, try closing all tags that you open (except the unclosable tags)
[09:21:11] <GoSox> i tried removing the P tags all together, it has no effect
[09:21:19] <duch_kazatel> can you do that and share the result with us?
[09:21:43] <GoSox> ok, the first form has no P's in the form tag now
[09:22:31] <duch_kazatel> okay one sec.
[09:23:23] <GoSox> i'm exteremely tempted to just start sending IE9 to http://obsolete.whatsmyip.org and call it a day
[09:23:50] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing the <p> remoed.
[09:23:52] <duch_kazatel> *removed.
[09:24:02] <GoSox> in the first form, the "URL Encoding" form?
[09:24:12] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:24:45] <brunoais> it can be cache
[09:24:47] <GoSox> they're gone
[09:24:50] <duch_kazatel> i cleared cache
[09:25:00] <GoSox> i jsut checked the source in safari
[09:25:08] <GoSox> (aside from the source file open right next to me)
[09:25:09] <duch_kazatel> let me triple check.
[09:27:17] <duch_kazatel> I manually cleared cache and am still seeing it.  that's really strange.
[09:27:31] <GoSox> that is strange. in IE9 only, or in other browsers too?
[09:27:47] <duch_kazatel> 9 onle.
[09:27:49] <duch_kazatel> *only
[09:27:53] <duch_kazatel> i think.
[09:27:56] <duch_kazatel> sec
[09:28:05] <duch_kazatel> and in FF.
[09:28:07] <GoSox> im not seeing them in IE9 either
[09:28:17] <GoSox> i think your ISP is up to something funny
[09:28:21] <duch_kazatel> any sort of colo or cdn?
[09:28:32] <GoSox> my own server
[09:28:37] <MikeD_> i've never even seen IE9
[09:29:11] <GoSox> duch_kazatel: can you reload in firefox
[09:29:19] <GoSox> and check out the placeholder in the first textarea
[09:29:26] <duch_kazatel> yep.  there.
[09:29:34] <duch_kazatel> still seeing the p tag.
[09:29:34] <GoSox> and the Ps are too?
[09:29:40] <GoSox> i can't explain that
[09:29:57] <GoSox> it's not there, in the actual source, or any of the source viewrs of any of my browsers
[09:29:58] <brunoais> me2
[09:30:04] <brunoais> GoSox, clear the cache
[09:30:12] <brunoais> not the browser's
[09:30:14] <brunoais> the server's
[09:30:32] <GoSox> theres nothing to clear. i just edited the file, reloaded my browser, and see my edits
[09:30:35] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/5XH3De0.png
[09:30:40] <duch_kazatel> that's what IE9 is showing me.
[09:30:44] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:31:22] <GoSox> huh
[09:31:35] <GoSox> that opening <p> tag is there, but that closing P is not
[09:31:49] <GoSox> any sane browser would close the P BEFORE THE FUCKING FORM tag
[09:32:09] <BillCriswell> Do I hear quirks mode?
[09:32:19] <GoSox> that did it
[09:32:27] <brunoais> BillCriswell, no, go back to sleep
[09:32:29] <brunoais> :)
[09:32:29] <GoSox> the <p> before the <form> was messing up the form
[09:32:29] <MikeD_> forms are inline
[09:32:36] <GoSox> goddamnit i hate IE
[09:32:37] <GoSox> SO MUCH
[09:32:41] <BillCriswell> Ok. =(
[09:32:45] <brunoais> GoSox, welcome to the club
[09:32:53] <BillCriswell> Well, actually... Ok =)
[09:32:58] <brunoais> basically it's due to IE that I ever use jQuery
[09:33:15] <brunoais> not the only reason
[09:33:18] <brunoais> just the main one
[09:33:30] <brunoais> each IE version lasts too long
[09:33:42] <brunoais> and they don't fix those bugs!
[09:33:45] <GoSox> on WhatsMyIP.org, IE9 use is down to 1.9%
[09:33:49] <GoSox> i really ought to just block it
[09:34:01] <GoSox> redirect it to my HTML4/no CSS mini site
[09:34:13] <GoSox> IE9 can go hang out with IE4.5
[09:34:19] <brunoais> \o/
[09:34:32] <brunoais> Well I still supprot IE9 in what I do, though
[09:34:44] <GoSox> i do for now, but
[09:34:44] <brunoais> I'm nearly unsupporting IE8, though
[09:34:54] <GoSox> this incedent is making me change my mind
[09:35:00] <brunoais> GoSox, try using a div instead of a <p>
[09:35:08] <brunoais> just to reduce anger
[09:35:27] <GoSox> plus with the recent press, nows an ideal time to suprise any lingering IE9 users with "YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE".
[09:36:04] <brunoais> yeah, dont' forget that
[09:36:16] <brunoais> In my work I'm starting to show that, btw ;)
[09:38:03] <duch_kazatel> back.
[09:38:29] <duch_kazatel> we figure it out?
[09:38:34] <BillCriswell> Just go to use libsass for a few minutes... it was like border line romantic.
[09:38:35] <GoSox> yeah
[09:38:40] <duch_kazatel> hah, what was it?
[09:39:03] <GoSox> the <p> before the <form>
[09:39:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's what I was talking about befor.e
[09:39:17] <duch_kazatel> ooooh there was another <p> in there?
[09:39:19] <GoSox> instead of self-closing before the form, it was closing itself and the form, after the form opened
[09:39:32] <GoSox> i had deleted all the Ps IN the form, not around it
[09:39:36] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah.
[09:39:52] <GoSox> i'm just deleting all the Ps before my FORMs and adding some css margin-top to make up for it
[09:39:58] <GoSox> which i should be doing anyway but, meh
[09:40:01] <duch_kazatel> i see the miscommunication now.  yeah, IE9's markup parsing stuff is a little strange.
[09:41:38] <BillCriswell> Man, computers are weird.
[09:41:44] <duch_kazatel> and dumb.
[09:42:02] <brunoais> specially dumb
[09:42:09] <brunoais> they just know how to follow orders
[09:42:13] <BillCriswell> Just ran a command, got pages or errors, waited a minute, reran the same command and it worked fine.
[09:42:14] <GoSox> specially dumb when we're talking about IE
[09:42:18] <brunoais> not matter if they would go against their survival
[09:42:51] <duch_kazatel> GoSox nah i'm fine with IE. it's got its quirks, sure, but every browser has the,.
[09:42:52] <duch_kazatel> *them
[09:43:19] <GoSox> an IE quirk is very different from every other browsers' quirks
[09:43:25] <duch_kazatel> not imo.
[09:43:44] <brunoais> Starting in IE10 IE's quirks are like any other's quirks
[09:43:49] <brunoais> but not IE9 and below
[09:44:33] <BillCriswell> I am hoping this works as well as I imagine: http://harpjs.com/
[09:44:48] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[09:46:08] <darnell> BillCriswell, what are you trying to do with Harp?
[09:46:21] <BillCriswell> darnell: Just use it haha
[09:46:33] <BillCriswell> It just gave me a weird error installing but it's cool now and seems to be working.
[09:47:04] <darnell> I was going to use it to edit project documentation in Markdown.  But, it doesn't allow you to link to Markdown files directly like Gihub does.
[09:47:07] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell: man of many toys
[09:47:15] <darnell> Github, that is.
[09:47:52] <BillCriswell> darnell: Ahhh, got it... I have no idea what I plan on using it for. I really need something to build on the side one of these days.
[09:48:16] <darnell> Finding solutions in search of problems? :)
[09:48:33] <GoSox> i love my apache
[09:48:41] <darnell> I go in the opposite direction, which is surprisingly ineffective.
[09:48:44] <GoSox> i will not give it up
[09:48:55] <BillCriswell> darnell: Haha, just waiting for something to really click with me
[09:49:14] <BillCriswell> The last thing to really click was gulp. Hoping harp does as well.
[09:49:15] <duch_kazatel> apache is fine.  it's like everything else: it's got a time and a place.
[09:49:17] <darnell> Harp seems cool.  It's 153 lines of Node.js code.
[09:49:42] <darnell> ...but includes several Node.js packages, of course.
[09:49:52] <BillCriswell> Yeah it seems helpful.
[09:56:32] <GoSox> ok this page is DONE
[09:56:34] <GoSox> time for bed
[09:58:09] <BillCriswell> Night!
[10:06:06] <BillCriswell> darnell: It's like a command line mixture almost.
[10:06:56] <darnell> BillCriswell: The Harp code, you mean?
[10:07:04] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:07:30] <BillCriswell> It reminds of mixture.io, but with a command line instead of a GUI.
[10:09:13] <duch_kazatel> http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks i'm 2 paragraphs in and terrified.
[10:10:15] <darnell> Haven't used Mixture.  But Harp seems pretty simple.  I bet I can make it do what I want.
[10:11:01] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. I like it so far.
[10:11:40] <BillCriswell> darnell: Yeah definitely. Mixture has some nice features as well though. I still barely use it though.
[10:13:12] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I feel like I'm reading something by a pissed off "why".
[10:13:12] <nhulea> yo
[10:13:40] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it gets into that territory.  the bridge analogy is almost perfect.  and the bit about "glorified shopping carts"
[10:13:50] <duch_kazatel> oh and the entire section about the "Perfect File"
[10:14:37] <BillCriswell> HAhaha
[10:15:57] <airdem> hi guys, id like to develop a wesite for mobile phones. can you suggest a free android emulator?
[10:16:08] <duch_kazatel> airdem sure - chrome.
[10:16:13] <airdem> or whats the best way to test how the website will look on a mobile phone
[10:16:20] <nhulea> hey is there a way I could debug a button in mobile safari cause I am getting some seriously weird results
[10:16:22] <airdem> without using one
[10:16:41] <BillCriswell> nhulea: You on a mac?
[10:16:43] <duch_kazatel> airdem http://i.imgur.com/IOEQIdm.png
[10:16:52] <duch_kazatel> this is inside of chrome's dev tools.
[10:16:53] <nhulea> when I nope
[10:16:57] <nhulea> jesus
[10:16:59] <nhulea> nope
[10:17:04] <BillCriswell> when I nope jesus.
[10:17:31] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a song lyrics.
[10:18:08] <nhulea> my button works sometimes and sometimes not anyone have an iphone they can see exactly what I am talking about but obviously it works completely fine on a desktop
[10:19:02] <airdem> duch_kazatel, thank you very much
[10:20:01] <duch_kazatel> nhulea http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/ check this out.
[10:20:08] <BillCriswell> nhulea: You can maybe try it on a windows machine? There's a setting in the iPhone at Settings > Safari > Advanced > Web Consolde and there it'll also tell you hot to enable it in regular Safari.
[10:20:40] <BillCriswell> Oooooo looks fanct nhulea
[10:20:45] <BillCriswell> fancy duch_kazatel*
[10:20:48] <duch_kazatel>  :)
[10:21:00] <duch_kazatel> one of our guys uses it to test basically everything at once.
[10:21:03] <nhulea> damn thatb does looks nice
[10:21:13] <duch_kazatel> and you can do debugging and stuff.
[10:21:31] <nhulea> yeah there some weirdness and I cant see what is going wrong to fix it
[10:21:39] <nhulea> there is
[10:22:09] <duch_kazatel> you could also try the chrome emulation on desktop.
[10:22:15] <duch_kazatel> maybe that'll reveal the issue?
[10:22:47] <nhulea> chrome emulation ? I am using a user agent switcher is that what you mean?
[10:23:08] <duch_kazatel> not sure what all this does; http://i.imgur.com/gnZ3HOo.png
[10:23:13] <duch_kazatel> but maybe you can replicate in there?
[10:24:09] <darnell> @BillCriswell Yeah.  I was wrong.  There's a little more code in Harp than what I was looking at earlier.  Still not very large.
[10:24:26] <darnell> Anyways.  Going to get back to the fun.
[10:26:34] <BillCriswell> darnell: Haha
[10:29:04] <nhulea> yeah see it works perfectly in the emulation basically heres the error
[10:31:00] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/2/ Could someone help me figure this out?
[10:31:26] <phelix> on click it needs to add a class and then search the li for another class and remove it from there. I think that I am super close
[10:31:49] <duch_kazatel> the active class?
[10:32:35] <nhulea> I have a canvas and then I an trying use canvastoDataURL to create an image of the canvas in an overlay div I load the page it make a picture and then click save which runs the code to do what I said covert the canvas to image but then I switch to landscape and then I click the button nothing happens I switch back to portrait and then the button works again then I switch to landscape and...
[10:32:37] <nhulea> ...then it works this time basically sometimes it just intermittently doesn't work
[10:32:37] <darnell> Why not remove it from all first, then add it to the one that was clicked?
[10:32:56] <darnell> @phelix
[10:32:56] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/3/
[10:33:25] <phelix> Well if you cick on it. The one you clicked needs to have active and it needs removed from wherever it was.
[10:33:39] <duch_kazatel> phelix right - look at my example.
[10:33:57] <duch_kazatel> or, for more specificity:  t
[10:34:00] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/Ve352/4/
[10:34:59] <darnell> Or if you don't want to deselect every li on the page: http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/3/
[10:35:24] <phelix> ahh ok. I think */4 should work
[10:35:33] <phelix> and you made it even more simple than what I had. thanks!
[10:35:45] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those thiongs we make too hard for outselves :)
[10:35:47] <duch_kazatel> *ourselves
[10:36:01] <nhulea> actually duch_kazatel this emulation thing might not specifically help what I am debugging but it looks liek you can debug alot of weird shit with this thanks
[10:36:11] <duch_kazatel> nhulea deffo.
[10:36:29] <phelix> yah, I was going to create a function for reach li. nice
[10:37:03] <duch_kazatel> oh wow.
[10:37:30] <phelix> super new to jquery.. But trying to learn.
[10:37:41] <duch_kazatel> you'll get there.
[10:41:13] <zizzl_> Anyone here attend the San Diego jQuery conference?
[10:43:28] <duch_kazatel> no.  totally wanted to, though.
[10:44:28] <zizzl_> damn this was this hilarious speach and saw the videos are up, trying to figure out who it was
[10:44:31] <zizzl_> I forgot
[10:45:52] <zizzl_> found it
[10:47:03] <Es0teric> ok is there any way to lock a div from moving to another slide unless a button is clicked?
[10:48:33] <duch_kazatel> "slide"?
[10:52:52] <s2013> how do i trigger an event when a checkbox is clicked? i just did $("#checkbox_id").click(function() {});
[10:52:54] <s2013> am i doing it wrong?
[10:53:02] <duch_kazatel> change.
[10:53:05] <s2013> o
[10:53:13] <duch_kazatel> .on('change', function(){});
[10:53:42] <s2013> can you do .change ?
[10:54:35] <duch_kazatel> sure, but that's just a shortcut to what i just gave you.
[10:54:42] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/610d5a14a4a0251f7d9e
[10:54:52] <s2013> k cause i usually have used .change.. anyways nothing happens
[10:55:14] <duch_kazatel> the first console log doesn't show up?
[10:55:21] <s2013> nope
[10:55:26] <s2013> i updated the gist with html as well
[10:56:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/B6MLg/
[10:56:21] <duch_kazatel> works here.
[10:56:21] <s2013> i know the js is beign loaded
[10:56:40] <Xal_> I'm creating a simple image rotator. I have an init function that sets everything up, and I have the right and left button function. In the init function, I'm setting setInterval to automatically call the right-button function every several second. In each of the button functions, I'm clearing the Interval and resetting it. My problem is that if I leave it alone after loading the page, the...
[10:56:42] <Xal_> ...Interval never starts. It only starts after I click one of the buttons.
[10:56:53] <duch_kazatel> s2013 http://jsfiddle.net/B6MLg/1/ make sure you've got a doc ready in there.
[10:56:53] <s2013> yeah thats hwy im weirded out
[10:56:58] <s2013> i do
[10:57:13] <duch_kazatel> s2013 does this get ajax'd in
[10:57:13] <duch_kazatel> ?
[10:57:21] <s2013> no
[10:57:51] <duch_kazatel> s2013 any errors in the console?
[10:57:52] <s2013> oh wait
[10:57:54] <s2013> yeah
[10:58:03] <s2013> i forgot, it does get ajaxed in
[10:58:14] <s2013> cause its a partial. i didnt knwo rails loaded partials with ajax
[10:58:59] <duch_kazatel> okay - what's a parent container that exists on pageload?
[10:59:12] <s2013> hmm hold on
[10:59:56] <s2013> i think i can figure it out from the rails side of things. let me check. thanks
[11:00:11] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[11:00:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/B6MLg/2/
[11:02:38] <s2013> k i got it to work. by writing the js in the partial
[11:02:53] <s2013> thanks
[11:02:57] <duch_kazatel> don't do that btw
[11:03:04] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[11:05:48] <duch_kazatel> s2013 because now every time you load that in it'll bind a new listener.
[11:05:51] <duch_kazatel> which is hacky.
[11:06:16] <s2013> ok let me google event delgation. thanks
[11:06:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/B6MLg/2/ <- i did it here.
[11:06:43] <duch_kazatel> you just need to find a parent element that exists on pageload.
[11:07:10] <Xal_> Can someone help me figure out why setInterval in the init function isn't working here? http://pastebin.com/f664HgLe
[11:08:07] <duch_kazatel> Xal_ btw doing this: div#dhtml-carousel
[11:08:16] <duch_kazatel> totally unnecessary.
[11:08:26] <duch_kazatel> and potentially slows your stuff down.
[11:09:01] <duch_kazatel> can you setup a working fiddle?
[11:10:34] <Xal_> doing what?
[11:10:46] <duch_kazatel> div#dhtml-carousel - should just be #dhtml-carousel
[11:10:52] <duch_kazatel> the tagname is entirely unnecessary.
[11:11:29] <BillCriswell> You also lose street cred for using "dhtml"
[11:11:36] <duch_kazatel> yeah that too.
[11:11:40] <Xal_> Yeah, that wasn't mine.
[11:11:44] <BillCriswell> Xal_: =)
[11:12:06] <Xal_> I yanked the javascript out that someone else was pulling from yahoo.
[11:12:17] <duch_kazatel> yui?
[11:12:23] <jtri> hello, wondering if adding jquerymobile is the best way to add taphold events (long click to get context menu)
[11:12:41] <duch_kazatel> jtri if that's the only thing you need, then no.
[11:12:59] <jtri> at the moment, it really is, I think, what would be better?
[11:13:22] <duch_kazatel> you want to load and entire mobile framework for a single gesture?
[11:13:30] <jtri> I have a site that already has some right click context menus and I'd like to raise them from mobile/touch devices
[11:14:16] <jtri> duch_kazat: nah, i'd like the simplest/lightest solution, just not sure what it is yet, timers?
[11:14:20] <duch_kazatel> something akin to this makes more sense: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2625240/923919
[11:14:43] <duch_kazatel> but don't return false from inside of those - pass in the event object and preventdefault on that instead.
[11:15:05] <jtri> ok, will do
[11:22:02] <Xal_> Right. Naturally it DOES work in jsFiddle.
[11:22:28] <duch_kazatel> same version of jquery?
[11:23:07] <Xal_> Not quite. I'm using 1.10.2 which isn't an option in jsFiddle, so I selected 1.10.1.
[11:23:18] <duch_kazatel> okay.  that shouldn't make a difference.
[11:23:45] <Xal_> http://jsfiddle.net/Y52Tk/
[11:27:17] <Velveeta> xal_ are you still trying to figure this out?
[11:27:39] <Xal_> yes
[11:27:45] <Velveeta> ok, taking a look now
[11:28:47] <Velveeta> and yeah, it works in the fiddle... are there any errors being thrown in your local code?
[11:29:12] <Xal_> No
[11:30:00] <Velveeta> and i don't suppose that's publicly accessible at all is it?
[11:30:09] <Xal_> No
[11:30:48] <Velveeta> have you tried dropping some breakpoints into your moveRight/moveLeft functions to isolate whether they're either a) not being called, or b) being called and not working as expected?
[11:32:32] <Xal_> Yeah. I put a break in moveRight and it didn't get called until the button was actually clicked. $(document).ready() should have set it up to be called eight seconds after the page loaded.
[11:33:45] <Xal_> I made sure the break wasn't inside that big if statement.
[11:34:05] <Velveeta> what happens if you convert moveRight/moveLeft to actual function declartions vs expressions?
[11:34:16] <Velveeta> like function moveRight () vs var moveRight = function ()
[11:34:55] <Velveeta> i know that js interpreters can sometimes be weird about how they handle variable references to function expressions... if they haven't been executed yet, they don't see them as functions, but rather as undefined
[11:35:20] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/5/
[11:35:25] <laughinghan> I'm trying to comment on an old jQuery ticket, and I keep getting: Submission rejected as potential spam (Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)
[11:35:31] <Xal_> Same thing. Nothing happens
[11:35:40] <phelix> Could someone help me figure out what javascript to use so that when i click that tab at the top it ads the hide-tab class from the container ?
[11:35:46] <vladikoff> laughinghan, link?
[11:36:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix that's pretty trivial.
[11:36:12] <laughinghan> vladikoff: I'm trying to add a comment to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10345
[11:36:38] <phelix> duch_kazatel: What do you mean?
[11:36:47] <brunoais> vlad_starkov, I'm also getting that a lot
[11:37:07] <Velveeta> heya vladikoff
[11:37:07] <brunoais> vladikoff, I also getting that a lot
[11:37:20] <brunoais> *I'm
[11:37:32] <duch_kazatel> phelix $('thing').on('click', function(){ $('other-thing').addClass('hide-tab')});
[11:37:41] <Velveeta> xal_: hmmm, then i'm out of ideas without being able to see a recreation of it to investigate further...
[11:37:44] <phelix> awesome thanks
[11:38:14] <laughinghan> brunoais: only a  lot? So not always?
[11:38:29] <brunoais> laughinghan, not always, yes
[11:38:30] <laughinghan> it seems like a p silly error
[11:38:35] <brunoais> No
[11:38:37] * drej waves to vladikoff 
[11:38:43] <drej> did i miss you at jqueryto ?
[11:38:44] <brunoais> It seems like it is failing to parse the URL
[11:38:46] <laughinghan> so maybe I should try a few more times
[11:39:05] <vladikoff> drej, totally, cannot believe i didn't see you, I walked everywhere
[11:39:08] <laughinghan> brunoais: huh?
[11:39:18] <drej> vladikoff i wasnt there for too long, i only caught like 3-4 hours in total for the whole weekend
[11:39:18] <brunoais> up
[11:39:20] <brunoais> I mean
[11:39:22] <brunoais> *ups
[11:39:30] <brunoais> It is failing to parse the IP
[11:39:52] <laughinghan> I assumed it's just behind a reverse proxy
[11:40:04] <Es0teric> ok is there any way to lock a div from moving to another div unless a button is clicked?
[11:40:04] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Yeah, I had that part working. But not sure how to have it remove the hide-tab from that element when you click a different tab
[11:40:25] <Xal_> I tried calling moveRight just before the initial setInterval and it works. ;/
[11:40:38] <duch_kazatel> phelix can only on tab have that class at a time?
[11:41:12] <duch_kazatel> *one
[11:42:07] <phelix> duch_kazatel Well all tabs will have hide-tab class by default.. So when you click on a tab it removes the hide-tab from the one clicked
[11:42:14] <phelix> so yes only one should NOT have that class at a time
[11:42:18] <phelix> unless there is a better way to do this
[11:42:20] <jamieshepherd> Hi guys: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/16f6ee822703a36fe235 is there a way to join these into one function?
[11:42:48] <duch_kazatel> phelix okay, so all but one should have it?
[11:42:57] <phelix> ya
[11:43:25] <duch_kazatel> then run $('element-or-class').addClass('hide-tab') before you run your $('thingToShow').removeClass('hide-tab');
[11:43:31] <duch_kazatel> that's one way.
[11:43:34] <phelix> also though, I'll need to make sure that by default or when the page first loads that its the first tab that doesn't have it. Which should be easy. But need to make sure when clicking a different tab that it removes the class from the first
[11:43:48] <phelix> ohh
[11:45:25] <Xal_> I just figured out what the problem is and WHY it was working in jsFiddle.
[11:45:34] <drej> yay
[11:45:43] <duch_kazatel> woop
[11:46:00] <Xal_> There's apparently another script somewhere using "timer" as a variable.
[11:46:22] <phelix> duch_kazatel: doesn't seem to remove it though
[11:46:24] <Xal_> I changed the variable name, and it works fine now.
[11:46:35] <duch_kazatel> Xal_ scope that to that closure as well.
[11:46:39] <duch_kazatel> phelix i need a fiddle at this point.
[11:46:44] <duch_kazatel> otherwise i'm flyng blind.
[11:46:46] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/7/
[11:47:19] <Velveeta> ahhhhhhh
[11:47:24] <Xal_> duch, closure?
[11:47:42] <duch_kazatel> Xal_ that document ready closes over your other functions - that's a closure.
[11:47:49] <duch_kazatel> helps control scope and reduce problems like that.
[11:47:52] <duch_kazatel> since globals are bad.
[11:48:21] <Velveeta> (y)
[11:48:27] <duch_kazatel> phelix this looks like it's working for me.
[11:48:37] <MikeD_> is there a way to set a div to height and width that it currently is?  I'm going to clear contents and reload, but i don't want the rest of the page to reflow
[11:48:42] <duch_kazatel> and now ir broke.
[11:48:58] <Velveeta> duch's seal of approval: http://i.imgur.com/X8A9S5o.jpg
[11:49:12] <phelix> duch_kazatel: its adding the contents of tab one to tab two intead of hiding one and then showing two
[11:49:17] <duch_kazatel> D:
[11:49:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah one sec.
[11:49:31] <Velveeta> miked_: yourDiv.height(yourDiv.height()); and the same for width
[11:49:35] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: You can set the styles inline (using .css())
[11:49:56] <duch_kazatel> phelix your code doesn't make sense - $('div.step-one').addClass('hide-tab') followed by $('div.step-one').removeClass('hide-tab'); ?
[11:49:58] <MikeD_> perfect
[11:50:22] <phelix> i know it doesn't lol. but thought thats what you had said to do
[11:50:29] <duch_kazatel> phelix no.
[11:50:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/8/
[11:50:58] <duch_kazatel> it'll look something more like this.
[11:52:03] <duch_kazatel> wait the this is wrong in those though.
[11:52:12] <phelix> ya
[11:52:40] <duch_kazatel> so if I click "step one", what am I showing?
[11:52:52] <duch_kazatel> div.step-one?
[11:52:57] <phelix> the div of class div.step-one
[11:53:30] <EminenceHC> I am using the multiselect.js widget: http://loudev.com/ I am wondering if there would be anyway to persist the data to other select fields. For instance if I have two fields, I would like to use the multiselect for both of them. Anytime a user is selected I want it to remove the value from selectable options in both fields.
[11:54:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/Ve352/10/
[11:54:53] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something like that.
[11:54:54] <vladikoff> laughinghan, should be fixed
[11:55:40] <jtri> hmm, so if the context menu is popped up, i guess touching the option is not the same as clicking, in terms of the event passing all the right properties
[11:57:19] <jtri> in other words, i have two problems, one is that when I open the menu with right click, and then touch the option the parameter is not passed properly, i.e. the id of the clicked option, and secondly, I got the menu to appear with the long click, but it disappears when i release, and sliding over to the option and releasing does not trigger the click event
[11:57:46] <phelix> duch_kazatel: perfect. I can make this work. Thank you
[11:57:57] <decx> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ve352/11/
[11:58:30] <decx> uses the index of the clicked li to find the right .steps div
[11:58:35] <duch_kazatel> nice.
[11:59:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't like building logic off of indexes like that, but that works well otherwise.
[11:59:30] <decx> true, but tabs are ok
[11:59:43] <phelix> decx: nice. Now I have 2 items to play with. Thank you guys
[11:59:49] <jtri> I'm using this:  http://www.trendskitchens.co.nz/jquery/contextmenu/ for right click, and trying to add the context menues with long click too, here's what I've done: http://dpaste.com/0P6C77Z/
[12:00:23] <FernandoBasso> I am using $( '#container' ).height() from my script. I wait for the doom to be fully loaded before I run it. From the script, it shows a different measurement than if I run the code directly from the console. What could be the problem? Happens in Firefox and Opera (the only two I tested so far).
[12:00:38] <FernandoBasso> s/doom/DOM/ :D
[12:00:57] <StephenS> duch_kazatel:
[12:01:38] <duch_kazatel> yeah in this instance.
[12:02:01] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[12:02:34] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, what is the element with the id "container"?
[12:02:39] <brunoais> what are its CSS rules?
[12:02:44] <duch_kazatel> StephenS why'd you ping me?
[12:02:55] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: do you see what I do wrong in this binding, http://pastebin.com/g35guTg0 like you debugged my code yesterday :) it works however, when I put that code inside extern.php which is appended to html via ajax, it does not work.
[12:02:56] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: It is a div.
[12:03:12] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, how about its CSS?
[12:03:42] <duch_kazatel> StephenS what copntainer does .readmore get appended to?
[12:03:42] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/8934728 for the code to run from console, and the page (open console and reload the page to see the results from my script): http://www.senhormadrugada.com.br/evento/15/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-node-js-is-built-on-top-of-google
[12:03:48] <duch_kazatel> the class or ID, please.
[12:04:05] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: min-height: 500px;
[12:04:22] <brunoais> just that?
[12:04:32] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: <a class="readmore ratestyle">Rate</a>
[12:04:34] <StephenS> class.
[12:04:55] <duch_kazatel> huh?  StephenS that's not what i asked.
[12:05:07] <duch_kazatel> StephenS you said this code doesn't work, right?
[12:05:15] <StephenS> yes, problem is only in that code
[12:05:31] <StephenS> I append it as this: $('.extra').append(html);
[12:05:34] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[12:05:56] <duch_kazatel> $('.extra').on('click', '.readmore', function(){});
[12:06:06] <duch_kazatel> try that, instead of your $('.readmore').click(function (event) {
[12:06:12] <StephenS> ugh sorry
[12:06:15] <StephenS> not that sec.
[12:06:45] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: here; http://pastebin.com/KqsCy048
[12:06:51] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: Nope, just that.
[12:07:09] <StephenS> I do it on id: updates.
[12:07:15] <duch_kazatel> StephenS then replace my .extra with #updates
[12:07:17] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, could it be that the console is forcing the page to display the scroll bar?
[12:07:38] <brunoais> Or better
[12:07:42] <StephenS> there is no on click, I do it on scroll :) duch_kazatel
[12:07:50] <brunoais> the console is taking some height out of the page?
[12:08:18] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: full code: http://pastebin.com/HEVmsEZs
[12:08:23] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:08:27] <duch_kazatel> StephenS make a fiddle.
[12:08:34] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to keep playing guessing games.
[12:08:39] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: Yes, but I just tried with different console height, and the result is exactly the same.
[12:08:45] <hlfw0rd> I am making a jquery plugin and want to bind a click event to it. I need to do something every time an element namned "arrow" is clicked which is inside the main identifier
[12:08:45] <duch_kazatel> StephenS oined #jquery
[12:08:45] <duch_kazatel> [2014:04:30:12:06:45] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: here; http://pastebin.c
[12:08:47] <duch_kazatel> wtf.
[12:08:47] <StephenS> I cant
[12:08:49] <StephenS> its ajax.
[12:08:49] <mlt-> Is it safe to mix & match handlers for window load notifications? Like google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', somefunc) and $( window ).load( ...? Or shall I just use the latter no matter what? I presume things are executed in order they appear in script, right?
[12:08:57] <hlfw0rd> I can't figure out how to do this. i would appreciate any assistance.
[12:09:19] <duch_kazatel> StephenS also: you're defining a function, wrapping the body in a doc ready, then calling it in a doc ready.
[12:09:23] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, which values are you getting? can you give me examples?
[12:09:29] <hlfw0rd> eg (.arrow click inside main identifier
[12:09:35] <StephenS> whats prefered way?
[12:09:41] <adamsilver> do you guys know a better alternative to https://github.com/millermedeiros/crossroads.js or it's what i should use to have routes in my jq app?
[12:09:46] <duch_kazatel> just wraap it in a doc ready once.
[12:09:58] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: I pasted two links. Let' me paste the values.
[12:10:35] <duch_kazatel> StephenS i have no idea what your question is at this point.
[12:11:20] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: I need a new way to do this what I want.
[12:11:34] <StephenS> problem is in .html(); method.
[12:11:39] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/8918338
[12:11:40] <duch_kazatel> StephenS start over - put code in fiddle.  even if it doesn't run, it's more readable.
[12:12:03] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, are you able to place it in jsfiddle?
[12:12:05] <duch_kazatel> StephenS becuase you asked earlier about an event binding.  .html() has nothing to do with that.
[12:12:14] <brunoais> That makes it easier to check test and modify
[12:12:45] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: Isn't the website in the link enough? I'm not sure what I would paste in jsfiddle.
[12:13:22] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, if you don't know, just paste all the code
[12:18:14] <dougneiner> Am I missing something, or are the PNG fallback images for jQuery mobile corrupted on Google CDN?
[12:18:15] <FernandoBasso> http://jsfiddle.net/jE7cT/
[12:18:16] <dougneiner> Example URL: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquerymobile/1.4.0/images/icons-png/action-white.png
[12:19:38] <dougneiner> Compare with: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.2/images/icons-png/action-black.png (Since the white image blends into the page)
[12:20:16] <dougneiner> The same problem exists in 1.4.2, 1.4.1, and 1.4.0 on the Google CDN
[12:20:17] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, why do you need that information anyway?
[12:20:26] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, why not just use CSS to control that?
[12:21:00] <chair330> I've been trying to use history popstate for browser back after making an ajax call but it only goes back one page. Is there something I'm missing? http://dpaste.com/2SDR4SH/
[12:21:27] <FernandoBasso> Because there is a lateral menu that needs to be set the height of the container, and it is not fixed. Also, sometimes there is another div/section/whatever inside the container, making it even taller.
[12:21:31] <brunoais> chair330, popstate is to go back 1 step
[12:21:51] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, how come CSS does not solve that?
[12:22:39] <chair330> Brunoais: oh, is there a way to go back more than 1 step? What about storing every URL every visited and just loading it to the popstate each time?
[12:22:59] <brunoais> chair330, just all it multiple times
[12:23:03] <brunoais> *call
[12:23:18] <FernandoBasso> Because I don't know the height of the content.
[12:24:09] <StephenS> how to change value of class? <div class="s">THIS VALUE</div>
[12:24:24] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, so what?
[12:24:34] <brunoais> CSS can calculate for you
[12:24:51] <duch_kazatel> $('.s').text();
[12:25:14] <StephenS> text('sometxt');?
[12:25:28] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: Care to elaborate?
[12:25:48] <duch_kazatel> StephenS yep.
[12:25:53] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, well, what you want is 2 things side-by-side with the same height, right?
[12:26:23] <FernandoBasso> Yep, but the lateral menu is not side by side with the container.
[12:26:38] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, it's not but it is suppsoed to be, right?
[12:26:48] <FernandoBasso> I mean, not hierarchically side by side.
[12:26:49] <FernandoBasso> Yep.
[12:27:46] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, if you use a display of table on the container of both and then you use a display of table-cell on both, they will become side-by-side no matter what
[12:28:56] <FernandoBasso> I don't know. I have had enough problems with this layout already. Perhaps changing this will break other stuff. Anyway, I'll create a branch to try your suggestion. Thanks.
[12:29:48] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, if it does not work, try placing a markup-only div and make it a display table-row
[12:29:55] <brunoais> now I g2g
[12:30:02] <brunoais> I'll be back in a while
[12:30:21] <FernandoBasso> brunoais: All right.
[12:30:31] <brunoais> FernandoBasso, that div will contain the elements of display table-cell
[12:34:37] <jamieshepherd> Hi guys: http://jsfiddle.net/Z2Y5U/ So if you notice, when I open the menu, the #viewport div minimizes as I expect, the nav element however does not (and goes outside the viewable area). Any ideas?
[12:36:26] <jamieshepherd> Something to do with floated elements I guess, not sure how to overcome this
[12:38:54] <PhaseCode|Work> Is there a way to see if an element already contains a event handler on 1.10?
[12:40:49] <duch_kazatel> jQuery._data(element, 'events'); maybe?
[12:41:14] <PhaseCode|Work> ._data deprecated in 1.8
[12:41:45] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode|Work: I've never had to do that. Can you explain what you're going for?
[12:41:52] <duch_kazatel> no it wasnt.
[12:41:58] <duch_kazatel> .data(“events”) was.
[12:43:41] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: do you see my scroll function?
[12:43:42] <PhaseCode|Work> BillCriswell: I'm dynamically adding listeners onto an element on click, ie, when a user clicks a div, I'm having a file picker pop up. However, I'm generateing multiple listening events which is causing data being sent multiple times to the server
[12:44:08] <duch_kazatel> StephenS i did not.
[12:44:20] <StephenS> it works perfectly well, however I have another script on index page which hides form when X is pressed, so if I have 5 news, and I click X on all 5, scroll is not moved and no new news are loaded.
[12:44:29] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode|Work: It sounds like you should be able to use event delegation there?
[12:44:31] <lethjakman> is there a way to change the CSS on the .css file with jquery rather than just the objects on the page?
[12:44:38] <BillCriswell> If I'm reading right, at least.
[12:44:44] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman not really.
[12:44:50] <lethjakman> hmmm.
[12:45:06] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman that's one of the reasons you should add/remove classes from things
[12:45:11] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: Just overwrite the rules in an element... ideally you'd just want to change a class, though.
[12:45:17] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/4sESvQS0
[12:45:38] <duch_kazatel> StephenS i all ready told you to put it in fiddle, even if it doesn't work.  pastebin makes things are to read.
[12:45:41] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: Like $('head').append('<style> body { color: red; } </style>');
[12:46:06] <PhaseCode|Work> BillCriswell: Would it be considered, in bad practice, to unbind the event once I'm done using it. Since its dynamically generated?
[12:46:11] <StephenS> i can't its too complicated/
[12:46:16] <lethjakman> well...I have a class called ajax-trigger which should hide it until JS has run, is there a way to do that?
[12:46:21] <duch_kazatel> StephenS then i can't help you.
[12:46:35] <lethjakman> thing is...they can pop into existance after JS has been run.
[12:46:54] <duch_kazatel> StephenS that code is still not complete anyway.
[12:47:28] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode|Work: It wouldn't be very efficient. I think event delegation would make more sense. Thay way you don't need to bind to the element you're waiting for the event on directly.
[12:47:30] <StephenS> it is, imagine I have index page with 5 divs (news) and this: $(this).closest('form').fadeOut('fast');
[12:47:41] <duch_kazatel> StephenS not playing this game any more.
[12:47:43] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[12:47:46] <StephenS> so that script is executed 5 times and page remains blank, without news.
[12:48:00] <StephenS> because I haven't scrolled a bit ;(
[12:48:38] <MikeD_> "imagine I have..."  heh
[12:48:47] <duch_kazatel> i hate that so much.
[12:48:49] <lethjakman> perhaps a force-show class with a inline-block !important?
[12:48:50] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: When you call your ajax whatever function add a class to the body, do your thing, then in the success callback remove that class.
[12:49:07] <duch_kazatel> "just pretend you know what all of my code looks like and is doing"
[12:49:15] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: You shouldn't have to be forcing anything.
[12:49:19] <oggy729> Does getjson not handle errors? Such as 404...bad request...whatever?
[12:49:31] <BillCriswell> lethjakman: But depending on your code you might need to.
[12:49:43] <PhaseCode|Work> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/3LDst/1/ Thats what the code looks like
[12:49:49] <MikeD_> imagine you make a fiddle so we can _see_ it.  :)
[12:49:52] <lethjakman> just not sure of the best way to do this honestly.
[12:50:10] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman what's going on now?
[12:50:11] <lethjakman> I do like doing it with a class...however the fact that they can be reloaded makes it difficult. I'd rather not rerun that function on every load
[12:50:43] <duch_kazatel> ah, applying styles to dynamically loaded content?
[12:50:56] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: yeah.
[12:51:06] <duch_kazatel> lethjakman why aren't you editing your css?
[12:51:19] <lethjakman> I'm hiding it until JS loads...then running $('.ajax-trigger').css(display: 'inline-block);
[12:51:51] <lethjakman> because I'm not sure what to edit it to in this circumstance.
[12:51:53] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[12:52:20] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode|Work: So you only want the element to allow the change event once?
[12:52:30] <duch_kazatel> could always edit them in a fragment and then append the fragment to the document when it's all done.
[12:52:33] <duch_kazatel> bbiab lunch.
[12:53:15] <lethjakman> hrm. I think that was suggested. thanks guys.
[12:53:21] <lethjakman> gonna have to play with this...
[12:53:22] <PhaseCode|Work> BillCriswell: Yes. Unless the user goes in hits an edit button. In which case the same code could be run.
[12:55:37] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode|Work: How about just putting the disabled attribute on it after it's clicked and removing it after they click "edit"?
[12:55:44] <BillCriswell> PhaseCode|Work: I'm not sure I'm getting the whole picture.
[13:06:25] <DarkNova> can anyone help me with animations?
[13:11:34] <gratis> Anyone recommend a good drag-n-drop uploader? Dropzone looks promising.
[13:12:07] <DarkNova> there were some good ones i found before
[13:12:13] <DarkNova> let me see if i can find again
[13:14:36] <DarkNova> http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/html5-file-upload-jquery-php/
[13:14:47] <DarkNova> i use this one, but uploadify isnt bad either
[13:15:03] <igcewieling> Does anyone know where I might find a list of what things are attributes and which are properties?
[13:15:13] <duch_lunch> huh?
[13:15:17] <DarkNova> ?
[13:15:36] <igcewieling> duch_lunch: when should I use .prop() and when should I use removeAttr();
[13:15:59] <igcewieling> At this point I try both and use the one which seems to work.
[13:16:15] <duch_lunch> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5876747/923919
[13:16:17] <duch_lunch> start with this.
[13:16:53] <igcewieling> duch_lunch: Thanks!
[13:17:47] <gratis> DarkNova: Thanks...hadn't seen that yet. Looks pretty slick. Bare bones tho...
[13:18:02] <Es0teric> ok so i asked this question before but how do i lock the browser viewport from scrolling unless a click event happens on an arrow or something?
[13:19:05] <gratis> Es0teric: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4770025/how-to-disable-scrolling-temporarily/4770179#4770179
[13:20:25] <Es0teric> gratis so if i want to enable scroll on click of the arrow i just do window.addEventListener('DOMMouseScroll', wheel, true); right?
[13:21:06] <DarkNova> yeah, there a few good tutorials on making them, but you can also just find complete plugins, whichever way you go, take care to check your permissions
[13:21:08] <gratis> function enable_scroll() {
[13:21:08] <gratis>     if (window.removeEventListener) {
[13:21:08] <gratis>         window.removeEventListener('DOMMouseScroll', wheel, false);
[13:21:08] <gratis>     }

[13:21:09] <gratis> }
[13:21:59] <drej> gratis generally not a good idea to post code in the channel
[13:22:00] <drej> any channel
[13:22:12] <Es0teric> gratis so then i just call enable_scroll()
[13:22:18] <gratis> The user can still scroll by clicking and dragging the positional element of the scroll bar
[13:22:42] <gratis> drej: My bad. I'm new to the chat thing.
[13:22:53] <drej> no worries, just a heads up
[13:23:10] <Es0teric> gratis nah man... i want to lock everything from scrolling
[13:26:02] <gratis> Es0teric: Well, this has 153 ups on SO: "The scroll event cannot be canceled. You can cancel 2 things however: mouse scroll and buttons associated with scrolling."
[13:26:24] <Es0teric> ah i see, gratis
[13:27:02] <gratis> You could do all sorts of css trickery with heights and overflow...
[13:27:06] <drej> Es0teric you can just overflow: hidden;
[13:27:08] <drej> the container temporarily
[13:27:13] <drej> and it will make it so you cant scroll
[13:27:21] <Es0teric> drej that makes sense..
[13:27:22] <drej> iirc
[13:27:25] <duch_lunch> ^^ listen to drej
[13:32:07] <BillCriswell> Some of the questions on stack overflow make me so nervous.
[13:32:20] <drej> yeah
[13:32:32] <drej> like 90% of them are not real questions based on anything that makes logical sense
[13:32:34] <gratis> How so?
[13:32:39] <drej> they're just symptoms of things people are doing wrong
[13:32:47] <BillCriswell> gratis: Exactly what drej said.
[13:32:59] <duch_kazatel> it's become symptomatic of "code by google"
[13:33:20] <BillCriswell> "I need to find the third image without an id attribute".... What?
[13:33:37] <duch_kazatel> oh that's good.
[13:33:38] <BillCriswell> You should never need to do that lol
[13:33:41] <duch_kazatel> quora has a few gems, too.
[13:34:29] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Not too familiar with Quora.
[13:34:40] <duch_kazatel> think stack overflow for... everything.
[13:34:40] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I can trick my girlfriend into picking me up a burrito.
[13:34:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, haha.
[13:34:50] <BillCriswell> Well... forget that.
[13:34:56] <drej> BillCriswell i got a burrito for her!
[13:35:00] <drej> err
[13:35:15] <drej> i think stack overflow is the stack overflow for everything
[13:35:27] <gratis> pretty much
[13:35:27] <drej> lol
[13:35:35] <BillCriswell> drej: Haaaa
[13:35:37] <duch_kazatel> be all like "hey so uh they're about to burn the building down unless you can somehow get me warm beans, meat, cheese, and vegetables in some portable form".
[13:35:58] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Sounds believable.
[13:36:20] <BillCriswell> I used to hate mexican food. No idea when I switched over.
[13:36:50] <duch_kazatel> you you got some damned sense?
[13:37:17] <BillCriswell> Haha I guess so.
[13:38:02] <gratis> By mexican food do you mean mexican-american...tex-mex...food?
[13:38:29] <BillCriswell> gratis: Chipotle burritos is about as mexican as I get.
[13:38:36] <BillCriswell> No idea where that falls under.
[13:38:43] <duch_kazatel> mexican-american.
[13:39:12] <duch_kazatel> i can drive 30 seconds and get something from a taco truck.
[13:39:14] <gratis> Chipotle is as Mexican as a Pu Pu Platter is Chinese.
[13:39:24] <duch_kazatel> taco truck tacos make life worth living.
[13:40:10] <gratis> That's the only thing I miss about LA....taco trucks
[13:41:30] <BillCriswell> Do you guys call street vendors "roach coaches??
[13:41:36] <BillCriswell> "roach coaches"*
[13:41:57] <BillCriswell> I get in trouble every time I say it.
[13:48:08] <gratis> Actually a lot of them are pretty upscale nowadays...there is a whole scene of food truck snobbery
[13:49:59] <BillCriswell> gratis: Yeah, I don't doubt the cleanliness at all, but it was just something I grew up hearing so I keep finding myself saying it haha.
[13:50:05] <BillCriswell> I still eat out of them no problem.
[14:01:48] <zizzl_> Hey guys I have the disqus plugin for comments installed but want to use google+ comment plugin BUT want to keep all the current posts with the old plugin and all new with g+
[14:01:49] <zizzl_> possible?
[14:05:05] <nhulea> is there a way to speed up canvastodataurl ?
[14:22:32] <SenorSenpai> hi, I have a page which loads a bunch of images (these images are charts) how can I use jquery to reload them automatically every X minutes? thanks (im new to jquery btw)
[14:26:45] <duch_kazatel> !mdn settimeout @ SenorSenpai
[14:26:46] <b-ot> SenorSenpai: Sorry, no results for ‟developer.mozilla.org settimeout @ SenorSenpai”.
[14:26:50] <duch_kazatel> !mdn settimeout
[14:26:52] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: window.setTimeout - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setTimeout
[14:26:56] <duch_kazatel> ^^ there we go.
[14:36:36] <SenorSenpai> thanks duch_kazatel, how would I apply that to every one of my image elements exactly?
[14:36:55] <kneekoo> hello! :)
[14:37:14] <duch_kazatel> $('img').attr('src', savedURLFromEarlier + timeStampToCacheBust);
[14:37:24] <kneekoo> is it possible to use jQuery on a web page retrieved with $.get?
[14:37:35] <duch_kazatel> kneekoo yes.
[14:37:42] <duch_kazatel> i need to get back to my meeting.
[14:37:43] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:37:57] <kneekoo> I'd like to grab a web page in a variable, then use jQuery on it
[14:38:01] <kneekoo> thanks, duch_kazatel
[14:55:01] <Cyclohexane> I'm doing $(".desk_content_padding form").submit(); and it's generating TypeError: object is not a function what does this mean?
[14:56:27] <duch_kazatel> you have jquery loaded and are waiting for document ready?
[14:57:31] <Cyclohexane> duch_kazatel: i'm running it manually on the page in console
[14:58:10] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you do $(".desk_content_padding form") ?
[14:58:59] <Cyclohexane> duch_kazatel: it shows the form [<form ...>..</form>]
[15:00:25] <SenorSenpai> hi duch_kazatel, you gave me the way to change to attribute, I applied it to a class so all my images change, how can I make it change to the currently set image?
[15:00:32] <duch_kazatel> try jQuery(".desk_content_padding form").submit(); Cyclohexane
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> SenorSenpai you need to use a cachebusting strategy.  i'd attach a data-originalImg attribute to each image and read from that.
[15:01:33] <SenorSenpai> cachebusting strategy?
[15:01:48] <duch_kazatel> if you specify the exact same URL, the browser will load it from cache.
[15:02:03] <SenorSenpai> ah im specifying the current date
[15:02:15] <duch_kazatel> yep
[15:02:17] <SenorSenpai> the problem is how to get the exsting src attribute
[15:02:25] <SenorSenpai> when theres multiple images with the same class
[15:02:56] <SenorSenpai> so from your example the "savedURLFromEarlier" where do I get that?
[15:03:10] <duch_kazatel> do the data attribute instead.
[15:03:12] <duch_kazatel> it'll be easier.
[15:03:39] <SenorSenpai> ok, i'll add the attribute, then how do I grab that attrbute
[15:03:48] <SenorSenpai> and do I just make it the same as the src?
[15:03:50] <duch_kazatel> .data('originalImg');
[15:03:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[15:04:01] <ml74> I'm trying to download a file using jQuery's ajax function. So far I'm posting to the PHP script and it's showing a response, but I'm not sure what the jQuery function should do on success. Here's what I have so far: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ff235a27a05807413b7
[15:04:21] <duch_kazatel> so you'll enumerate through all the images and set the src to that image's .data('originalImg') + timestamp.
[15:06:54] <vacho> how how would I select this? <a href="#" data-guest-id="797" class="check-in-modal"></a>
[15:07:08] <duch_kazatel> $('.check-in-modal')
[15:07:12] <vacho> $('data-guest-id='797')... ?
[15:07:28] <vacho> duch_kazatel: by id
[15:07:32] <duch_kazatel> selecting via data attributes is VERY slow.
[15:07:46] <duch_kazatel> $('[data-guest-id="797"]')
[15:07:53] <duch_kazatel> avoid doing that if at all possible
[15:08:06] <vacho> duch_kazatel: is it better if I do a find on all check-in-modal and then from there do a select on id?
[15:08:14] <SenorSenpai> duch_kazatel: so I have $(".chartimg").attr("src", $(".chartimg").data('originalImg')+d.getTime().toString());
[15:08:18] <SenorSenpai> it sets it as undefined
[15:08:32] <ml74> vacho: What are you working on? Seems very similar to what I'm working on, weirdly!
[15:08:48] <duch_kazatel> vacho that would help a bit, but it will still be slow.
[15:08:50] <vacho> ml74: a check-in application.
[15:09:02] <ml74> vacho: For events?
[15:09:03] <vacho> what is a fast way of doing that then? :) I need to get that specific id :)
[15:09:06] <duch_kazatel> SenorSenpai can you create a small example on jsfiddle?
[15:09:08] <vacho> ml74: yes
[15:09:17] <duch_kazatel> vacho why not set that as the id of the node?
[15:09:21] <duch_kazatel> instead of the data-id?
[15:10:33] <vacho> duch_kazatel: I could, actually the parent parent has the ID too
[15:10:35] <vacho> as a #
[15:10:48] <duch_kazatel> vacho then use that ID instead.
[15:10:53] <duch_kazatel> and select from there.
[15:11:03] <duch_kazatel> data attributes are meant to store data, not to select on.
[15:11:11] <vacho> will do thanks mate.
[15:11:19] <duch_kazatel> classes and IDs are what you should be using.
[15:11:25] <ml74> I'm trying to download a file using jQuery's ajax function. So far I'm posting to the PHP script and it's showing a response, but I'm not sure what the jQuery function should do on success. Here's what I have so far: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5ff235a27a05807413b7
[15:11:56] <duch_kazatel> ml74 what are you wanting to do after the post completes?
[15:11:57] <SenorSenpai> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/X72uy/
[15:12:00] <duch_kazatel> display data or something?
[15:12:50] <ml74> dutch_kazatel: Download the file. I've set the headers in PHP as
[15:12:53] <ml74> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Z9pMyJ5C
[15:13:10] <duch_kazatel> you can't download from a post iirc.
[15:13:42] <ml74> Hmmmm, how would I download the file without first saving it to a location then downloading from the URL?
[15:14:18] <ml74> I have the PHP script generating the PDF file (using a library), then the file is output in base64 encoded data.
[15:14:59] <duch_kazatel> SenorSenpai http://jsfiddle.net/X72uy/1/
[15:16:22] <ml74> duch_kazatel ^^
[15:16:33] <duch_kazatel> ml74 i'm looking one sec duder.
[15:17:02] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/16086435/923919 that's the best i can think of.
[15:19:18] <ml74> Hmmm
[15:21:09] <SenorSenpai> thanks duch_kazatel!
[15:21:14] <duch_kazatel> SenorSenpai of course.
[15:21:41] <Es0teric> what is event binding for again?
[15:21:45] <Es0teric> i forgot
[15:21:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[15:21:51] <Es0teric> like $.bind()
[15:22:03] <duch_kazatel> .on()
[15:22:12] <duch_kazatel> $('athing').on('event', function(){});
[15:22:42] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i can just do on "load" but would that be on ajax load or when the document loads?
[15:23:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:23:10] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what are you trying to do?
[15:23:36] <Es0teric> i want to lock scroll of a div on document load unless an arrow is clicked to move to the next div
[15:23:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel
[15:24:11] <duch_kazatel> "lock scroll of a div on document load" so when the page has loaded, after document ready?
[15:24:30] <SenorSenpai> duch_kazatel: heh, applied it to my project and it still does undefined o-o
[15:24:45] <duch_kazatel> SenorSenpai take a look at the html change i made.
[15:25:10] <SenorSenpai> I did, copy and pasted it basically out of jsfiddle
[15:25:20] <duch_kazatel> oh, SenorSenpai and that's only doing it on one image.
[15:25:35] <duch_kazatel> link to fiddle again?
[15:25:36] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yes
[15:25:53] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you want $(window).on('load', function(){});
[15:26:44] <SenorSenpai> http://jsfiddle.net/X72uy/3/ this was my update added a second different image
[15:27:03] <SenorSenpai> it still works, but when put into my page it breaks the images and src = undefined
[15:28:37] <duch_kazatel> SenorSenpai http://jsfiddle.net/X72uy/4/
[15:28:43] <duch_kazatel> you need to enumerate through all the iamges.
[15:28:45] <duch_kazatel> *images
[15:29:02] <duch_kazatel> if that still gives you problems, more info would be helpful.
[15:32:06] <SenorSenpai> duch_kazatel: this is my html right now http://cl.ly/code/0C2x2c0d2d04
[15:32:37] <SenorSenpai> its loading that circle 4 times right now
[15:32:49] <SenorSenpai> but after the reload, it loads to undefined for me
[15:33:58] <duch_kazatel> i'm not seeing that here: http://jsfiddle.net/juwvn/
[15:34:22] <SenorSenpai> what could be the problem? different jquery versions?
[15:34:31] <duch_kazatel> what version are you using on your site?
[15:34:46] <SenorSenpai> ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js
[15:34:50] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[15:34:59] <SenorSenpai> its a bit old? lol!
[15:35:06] <duch_kazatel> 2009
[15:35:09] <SenorSenpai> oh my
[15:35:10] <duch_kazatel> upgrade that.
[15:35:23] <duch_kazatel> 1.11 is out.
[15:36:50] <SenorSenpai> hey it works!
[15:36:53] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:36:59] <SenorSenpai> thanks, that was a dumb problem from me lol
[15:37:18] <duch_kazatel> nah it's all good.

[16:03:17] <duch_kazatel> wuddup
[16:15:13] <chair3303> I have a default Jquery UI Slider (http://jsfiddle.net/4MMLK/). I'm trying to make it so that when I click on the bar to the left of the handle, it'll go to the next value to the left of the handle. I'm talking about clicking immediately to the left of the handle as by default it doesn't do anything. Is something like this possible?
[16:15:47] <duch_kazatel> instead of having to travel about halfway?
[16:50:38] <mia> I need to loop through all the enabled check box..  is this close:  $(this).find('td input:checkbox:enabled').each(function () {
[16:51:33] <duch_kazatel> .find('input[type="checkbox"]:checked') maybe?
[16:51:39] <duch_kazatel> selectors like that are slow.
[16:54:31] <mia> :( I tried $(this).find('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').each(function (){ }  and doesnt work
[16:54:51] <duch_kazatel> what is $(this) in that context?
[16:55:23] <mia> im looping through the table
[16:55:26] <duch_kazatel> mia a fiddle would be awwesome.
[16:55:28] <mia> so this should be the row
[16:57:09] <mia> it workd.. Thanks.. I need to change it to enabled not checked
[16:57:34] <duch_kazatel> that's... not right.
[16:57:47] <duch_kazatel> :checked is what you wnat.
[16:58:23] <mia> I there are some rows that are disabled, so I only want to check the rows that are enabled
[16:58:32] <duch_kazatel> not checked?
[16:58:45] <mia> nope, not checked.  I will check them if they are enabled
[16:58:50] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:59:15] <mia> thanks very much!!  i wouldn't have guessed to use input[type=""]
[16:59:38] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  but be careful with that.
[16:59:43] <duch_kazatel> attribute selectors can be very slow.
[17:00:17] <mia> okay!  have a great day
[17:55:43] <chair3303> I have a default Jquery UI Slider (http://jsfiddle.net/4MMLK/). I'm trying to make it so that when I click on the bar to the left of the handle, it'll go to the next value to the left of the handle. I'm talking about clicking immediately to the left of the handle as by default it doesn't do anything. Is something like this possible?
[17:56:44] <duch_kazatel> i responded to that question earlier - you mean instead of having to go more than half way?
[17:58:17] <duch_kazatel> chair3303 ^^
[18:05:51] <chair3303> duch_katzatel: oops, didn't see your message earlier. Yeah instead of traveling half way
[18:06:06] <chair3303> duch_katzatel: oops, didn't see your message earlier. Yeah instead of going more than* half way
[18:07:25] <duch_kazatel> let me take a look.
[18:08:47] <chair3303> thanks, i searched for a while but didn't have any idea how i'd even approach it
[18:09:02] <duch_kazatel> about the only thing I can consider would be to set the stepping much lower and only show the first number, but it's kind of an unusual problem.
[18:09:14] <duch_kazatel> what problem are you actually trying to solve?
[18:10:55] <chair3303> well, I have only 3 options and it's not very intuitive because i find myself clicking near the middle often and can't get to the next value
[18:11:30] <duch_kazatel> it might be much more appropriate to use some radios instead.
[18:11:33] <chair3303> the way I see it- it should act like a normal scrollbar where you click upward anywhere on scrollbar, and it would increment to the next value
[18:12:39] <chair3303> i tried radio but still trying to see if I can have a solution with a scrollbar as it's what the design is currently based off of
[18:13:13] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to basically re-write the slider to change that logic.
[18:13:13] <chair3303> what about setting a event listener on top of the scrollbar, figuring out where the user clicks, and applying the next closest value?
[18:13:43] <chair3303> yeah I figured as much....
[18:13:47] <duch_kazatel> you could try that, but that's a hack.
[18:14:10] <duch_kazatel> if there are only three options, i'd style my own "slider".
[18:16:28] <chair3303> yeah okay, i'll see if there's another scrollbar out there that does what I want- and If not, then I guess I'll make my own. Thanks!
[18:16:37] <duch_kazatel> build your own.
[18:47:00] <TheWhisper> hey guys
[18:47:07] <TheWhisper> I have if(window.location.href.indexOf("index") === -1)
[18:47:34] <TheWhisper> so I want to run the function if the URL doesn't include "index"
[18:47:55] <TheWhisper> BUT I also don't want it to run when the site is gone to via www.mysite.com itself
[18:48:18] <TheWhisper> Is there a way I can do like if(doesn't include "index" AND is not www.mysite.com)?
[18:50:56] <TheWhisper> think I got it
[18:50:57] <TheWhisper> if(window.location.href.indexOf("index") === -1 && window.location.pathname.indexOf("pieces") === -1 && window.location.pathname !== '/')
[20:37:06] <andrewanderson> what's that one command again.. to bind events to items that aren't in the page yet
[20:37:23] <andrewanderson> not preventdefault, it's not working
[20:39:08] <andrewanderson> got it, event delegation
[20:50:12] <shoky> love that command
[21:45:50] <bsegovia> hey everyone. Is there a way to write a script that alters the javascript code already added inline to the page?
[21:46:51] <bsegovia> (e.g. the current script (which I don’t control) is bound to a submit button. The alert() text is terrible and I’m trying to update it
[21:52:26] <jphase> bsegovia: you mean the submit button has something like onclick="somejavascript" and you want to alter it?
[21:52:33] <bsegovia> right
[21:53:16] <jphase> bsegovia: yeah, just target that button, something like:  $('input[type="submit"]').removeAttr('onclick').on('click', function(){ //do stuff here });
[21:53:24] <jphase> just an example of course
[21:53:35] <bsegovia> oh jeez that’s brilliant
[21:53:52] <bsegovia> @jphase thanks bud. Derp moment
[21:53:59] <jphase> np
[22:06:44] <gtek1k> Hey all, if u look at bottom list items.. I'm trying to do similar mouse follow // scroll - any ideas what thats called or maybe the best/easiest way to do something like that?
[22:06:51] <gtek1k> http://www.lifeofpimovie.com/
[22:08:18] <wgreenberg> hey all, question about how jQuery gets initialized for a page. for Reasons, I cannot include jquery.js in my web page with a script tag, and am limited to WebKit's "run_javascript" API (essentially the same thing as pasting javascript into the console after the DOM is loaded)
[22:08:53] <wgreenberg> so when I call run_javascript on the text of jquery.js, I have a global $ object, but $(document).ready never fires and I cannot actually query for anything
[22:09:36] <wgreenberg> am I missing an obvious step in setting up the jQuery object, or is it just not possible to use jQuery in this fashion?
[22:11:59] <gtek1k> wgreenberg, have you tried binding with .on ?
[22:12:27] <wgreenberg> as in $(document).on('ready', ...)?
[22:13:24] <gtek1k> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:14:24] <wgreenberg> gtek1k, right, but I'm not sure event would I bind to? 'ready' never seems to be fired
[22:17:04] <wgreenberg> $("*") returns a confusing result that's basically a blank HTML doc: "<html><head></head><body></body></html>"
[22:30:56] <Junior> yello ;)
[22:31:01] <jphase> yo
[22:44:05] <wgreenberg> anyone know how I can troubleshoot why $("*") returns nothing but an empty HTML doc?
[22:45:09] <wgreenberg> which is to say, $("*") returns [<html>​…​</html>​, <head>​</head>​, <body>​</body>​]
[22:45:33] <wgreenberg> I can expand that first element and it'll just be the nested empty head and body elements
