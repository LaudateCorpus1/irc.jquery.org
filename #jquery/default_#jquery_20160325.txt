[00:15:37] <jak2000> how to get the current temperature from google? programming thanks
[00:27:00] <iateadonut> this is probably what you want: openweathermap.org/api rather than google jak2000
[00:27:33] <jak2000> iateadonut google havent any tool?
[00:27:41] <jak2000> https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/28.63,-106.07    wich is: 28.63 and -106.07 ?
[00:28:14] <iateadonut> those are probably lattitude and longitude coordinates
[00:28:26] <iateadonut> openweathermap.org has an api that returns JSON
[00:28:33] <iateadonut> and accepts a city name for the location
[00:28:36] <jak2000> ok is free?
[00:28:50] <iateadonut> "open" weathermap - i would guess it is free.
[00:29:46] <iateadonut> if not, then there might be some here you can check out:
[00:29:46] <iateadonut> http://www.programmableweb.com/news/top-10-weather-apis/analysis/2014/11/13
[00:30:11] <jak2000> ok
[00:30:57] <jak2000> iateadonut give me a hand, please
[00:31:13] <jak2000> The latitude and longitude of Mexico City is 19ยบ 24' N, 99 ยบ 09 W'.    how to traduce this info por ask here: https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/28.63,-106.07
[00:45:49] <[an]onymous> Anyone tell me if this image is real...? http://adf.ly/1Yk9Jw

[07:05:40] <Felishia> does someone know a jquery plugin for autogrow that works?

[07:14:07] <cryptopsy> how can i have a menu, where evertime the user descends into a submenu, the parent menu is hidden? so it behaves like boxes piling on top of each other in a way
[07:23:45] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:24:39] <jomofcw> I've got the same thing on my wbesite that on this JSFiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/a4pna2og/ . but on my website the animation doesnt' finish on hover out, and stay on the stage it is... do you see anything that could do that ?
[07:31:44] <jomofcw> The problem seems to come with fadeIn/Out method. Using animate with opacity instead work well.
[07:48:46] <stanmancan> Anyone around, and has used flex slider?
[09:53:54] <taplar> so quiet
[10:01:41] <decx> dont you have off
[10:01:54] <decx> what kind of christian nation is that
[10:06:04] <arc_> i've never heard of anyone getting good friday off
[10:06:07] <arc_> even the post office is open
[10:06:20] <decx> monday is off too
[10:06:45] <arc_> not here
[10:06:48] <arc_> banks are also open
[10:06:59] <decx> your country is just not christian enough
[10:07:03] <arc_> sry
[10:10:06] <taplar> we don't get hardly any days
[10:10:25] <taplar> we get like what some of the federal holidays were back in the 60s
[10:11:37] <decx> gotta work work work work work work work to buy buy buy buy buy
[10:12:06] <taplar> *shrug*
[10:13:00] <taplar> working retail, you work when the stores are open, :)
[10:13:55] <mouse> i have off
[10:13:59] <mouse> but i work at a jesuit institution
[10:36:27] <ggt> From the jquery documentation: .bind( eventType [, eventData ] [, preventBubble ] )       // but how does this work? Why is there no handler argument?
[10:37:10] <ggt> from : http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[10:42:48] <decx> maybe like you know, continue reading
[10:44:37] <shoky> but he's right
[10:44:40] <shoky> that's a docs bug
[10:45:05] <shoky> there's no such signature, and it wouldn't make sense
[10:45:22] <ggt> shoky: thanks.
[11:18:27] <Renku> hi :)
[11:18:34] <taplar> aloha
[11:18:52] <Renku> is it the chan for jqueryui too or am I on the wrong one ? =]
[11:18:57] <taplar> yep
[11:19:42] <Renku> ok, so a quick question very stupid : I need several css theme for jquery on my page, so I designed a few variant of the start theme : the start theme is unscoped, others are
[11:20:02] <Renku> have I to include each time structure.css, ui.css and theme.css or just theme is ok ?
[12:24:56] <jquery015> Hi guys, I need to select the "next button" in this page. This check is working: $("input[type='button']").parents().hasClass('group-multipage-dati-principali')
[12:25:09] <jquery015> but I can't select the button itself
[12:25:17] <jquery015> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[12:25:26] <robertmaxrees> $("input[type='button']").closest('.group-multipage-dati-principali')
[12:25:39] <jquery015> ok I'll try
[12:28:08] <jquery015> mmm no, I need to do:         					$("input[type='button']").closest(".group-multipage-dati-principali").css("background-color", "#f00");
[12:28:22] <jquery015> but I need to apply the color to the button
[12:28:52] <jquery015> so I need to select the button whose parent or closest has that class
[12:33:22] <robertmaxrees> so you need all buttons that are children of ".group-multipage-dati-principali ?
[12:34:34] <jquery015> yes, basically is only ones
[12:34:56] <jquery015> but I need to learn how to select in this way, then I'll work with it
[12:35:04] <robertmaxrees> $(".group-multipage-dati-principali").find('input[type='button']);
[12:35:15] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, make a fiddle.
[12:35:21] <jquery015> ok
[12:39:21] <jquery015> robertmaxrees: great guy! anyway, just to see, does exist something like: $("input[type='button']").has(parent().hasClass("group-multipage-dati-principali")); ?
[12:40:04] <taplar> closest('.group-multi.....').length
[12:42:06] <jquery015> I mean not returning a "true/false" but the element itself whose parents has a specific class
[12:42:59] <taplar> from which direction?
[12:43:33] <taplar> robert's last comment would be from the parent direction
[12:44:11] <jquery015> yes, robert solution works good
[12:44:19] <jquery015> I mean from child direction
[12:44:54] <taplar> $(selector).filter(function(){ return $(this).closest('.group-multi....').length > 0; })
[12:47:18] <jquery015> ok, nothing more "synthetic"...thanks for your time taplar!
[12:58:56] <robertmaxrees> "synthetic"?
[12:59:33] <taplar> :)
[13:01:30] <taplar> he wants nylon, not cotton dude
[13:09:15] <cagmz> how do I know which selectors need spaces and which don't? for instance, $(".breadcrumb.wizard-breadcrumb").find("a:contains( Contact )"); (works) vs $(".breadcrumb.wizard-breadcrumb").find("a: contains( Contact )"); or $("#someId :contains(sometext)") (works)
[13:09:36] <taplar> a space denotes nesting
[13:09:57] <taplar> no space denotes a logical AND
[13:10:39] <systemfault> So weird that someone would think about doing jQuery when that person doesn't know CSS.
[13:10:52] <robertmaxrees> it's much more common than you'd think.
[13:11:06] <jquery015> ok, short form, not nylon sorry :DDD
[13:12:05] <jquery015> it exists anyway http://www.wordreference.com/iten/sintetico  :-P
[13:12:45] <jquery015> which form is preferred to add function? .on, .click, or .bind?
[13:12:55] <taplar> on
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> .bind is deprecated.
[13:13:05] <robertmaxrees> click just uses on under the hood.
[13:13:19] <jquery015> the before selection was to unbind the function to that button, now I need to add the new one
[13:13:26] <robertmaxrees> never unbind.
[13:13:32] <jquery015> :(
[13:13:36] <cagmz> so .breadcrumb.wizard-breadcrumb denotes something assigned 2 classes?
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> why would you unbind?
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> cagmz yes.
[13:14:12] <jquery015> because the event related to the button is a function inside a Drupal module that I don't want to override
[13:14:43] <jquery015> because for the button on the other page I need the basic function working as is
[13:15:29] <cagmz> where can I learn about selectors (like space denotes nesting, no space = logical and)?
[13:15:39] <robertmaxrees> cagmz learn basic CSS>
[13:16:12] <jquery015> if you speak Italian http://www.html.it/pag/18384/selettori-di-base-e-gerarchici/
[13:16:23] <cagmz> brb learning italian
[13:16:48] <richardsmd> I have a question about jqueryui's datepicker.
[13:16:49] <richardsmd> Basically, I have a SPA I'm adding to. On some page transitions datepicker instances are removed from the DOM, but a JS object with a reference to that DOM node is kept.
[13:16:49] <richardsmd> On returning to the page I use $.replaceWith() to insert the old DOM where the new (blank) one is. But, for whatever reason, the datepickers arent working. Moreover, I try re-initializing but nothing happens. I think this is because the DOM node still has the hasDatepicker class
[13:16:49] <richardsmd> my fix is to just removeClass('hasDatepicker') and re-initialize, but this feels hamhanded. is there a better way?
[13:17:36] <jquery015> anyway, what should I use in the place of .unbind()?
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery015 rethink the problem entirely?
[13:18:44] <jquery015> after boring you with the selector and spent 2 hours...mmm
[13:19:05] <jquery015> which problems are related with unbind()?
[13:19:10] <shoky> richardsmd: the proper thing to do when removing a widget from the DOM is to uninitialize it by calling its 'destroy' method
[13:19:20] <robertmaxrees> juggling event bindings is confusing and leads to a lot of headaches.
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> so i like to streer people away from binding and unbinding.
[13:19:39] <shoky> richardsmd: but you could just hide the contents and re-show them later and you wouldn't need to reinitialize it
[13:20:01] <jquery015> are you in Drupal?
[13:20:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:20:10] <jquery015> ok
[13:21:20] <jquery015> well, I can follow my idea, taking in consideration your ads about unbind. the other solution is this: http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/136008/how-to-add-validation-on-next-button-usign-fieldgroup-module
[13:21:31] <richardsmd> shoky: thank you much!
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> they're not ads - just advice.
[13:22:17] <jquery015> but write a module for a brunch of javascript...mmm I find it tedious
[13:22:33] <jquery015> sorry, no advertisements, just advice ;)
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like maybe you're misapplying a tool ;)
[13:23:21] <jquery015> no, check this threa
[13:23:22] <jquery015> d
[13:23:23] <jquery015> https://www.drupal.org/node/1340082
[13:23:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:31] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[13:23:39] <jquery015> that module misses validation
[13:23:42] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:23:58] <cannap> dayum
[13:24:11] <jquery015> and I need just one different from email, required ecc,
[13:24:36] <jquery015> just compared some number before changing page
[13:26:06] <jquery015> and take care of code maintainability, of course ;)
[13:26:21] <jquery015> thanks for your help!
[13:27:34] * taplar is surrounded by cats
[13:29:48] <jquery015> taplar is lucky!
[13:30:11] * taplar is referring to people who sound like they are going to cough up a lung as 'cats'
[13:30:52] <cagmz> is there a way to check if clicking a link would take you to another page? my breadcrumbs have # for href but they are using data-bind functions to take you to other pages (or not)
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> not really
[13:44:33] <jquery015> why if (-1) works as true?
[13:46:43] <robertmaxrees> because 0 is falsy.
[13:46:47] <robertmaxrees> any other number is truthy.
[13:49:20] <jquery015> :(
[13:49:32] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting -1?
[13:49:43] <jquery015> ok but isArray return -1 in case of no success
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean inArray
[13:49:59] <jquery015> exaclty
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> you said isArray
[13:50:24] <robertmaxrees> and inArray gets you the index of an item in an array.
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> 0 is a valid array index.
[13:50:43] <robertmaxrees> so you need to do an explicit check.
[13:51:01] <jquery015> ok is the return value is > 0
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> > -1
[13:51:12] <robertmaxrees> 0 is a valid array index.
[13:51:46] <jquery015> or if is < 0
[13:51:54] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:51:56] <robertmaxrees> just > -1
[13:52:01] <jquery015> ok
[13:52:02] <robertmaxrees> you can't go lower than -1
[13:52:29] <taplar> you could do < 0 if you were wanting to check that it did not exist
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> arrays can have indexes ranging from 0 to some stupidly high number
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> or just === -1 in that case imo.
[13:53:09] <jquery015> ok thanks, I'm testing > -1
[13:53:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[13:57:38] <jquery015> var a_convivente = (93, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259);         							if ($.inArray($("#edit-field-livello-und option:selected").val(), a_convivente) > -1)
[13:57:48] <jquery015> not working well, maybe a cast problem?
[13:59:29] <robertmaxrees> ar a_convivente = (93, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259); what are you expecting this to be?
[13:59:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array.
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> you want []
[13:59:40] <robertmaxrees> not ()
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> also, .val() returns strings.  you need to parseInt it.
[14:01:54] <jquery015> azz! maybe I need relax :P
[14:01:57] <jquery015> thanks!
[14:03:47] <jquery015> wonderful!
[14:03:52] <jquery015> kiss
[14:30:15] <cagmz> how can I click a link and open it in a new appended div?
[14:30:26] <robertmaxrees> by loading it via ajax
[14:30:36] <robertmaxrees> or use an iframe
[14:44:14] <jquery015> is it possible to use inArray() with a switch case statement?
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't
[14:46:32] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[14:54:35] <jquery015> I have to check more than one time the value of a field, if is belong to a specific array or not
[14:54:43] <jquery015> just to save some if else
[14:56:12] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know if a value is contained in some arrays?
[15:05:30] <jquery015> exactly
[15:06:13] <jquery015> http://kopy.io/dh1Wy
[15:06:23] <jquery015> I need probably one more array only
[15:06:35] <robertmaxrees> what do these arrays represent?
[15:07:01] <robertmaxrees> also - store parseInt($("#edit-field-livello-und option:selected").val()) in a var and use that instead in grabbing it over and over.
[15:07:42] <jquery015> represent the value
[15:07:48] <jquery015> of a dropdown box
[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:09:54] <jquery015> this is the full code
[15:09:55] <jquery015> http://kopy.io/n40xY
[15:10:05] <jquery015> for the page I posted before
[15:10:07] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:10:12] <jquery015> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[15:10:15] <jquery015> second page
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i don't want to hgave to go through an entire page, and giving me over 500 loc isn't helpful.
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> can you make a simplified fiddle of what you're trying to accomplish?
[15:10:57] <NitroLiq> Hi all, is there a reason this statement wouldn't work? if ($('.more-stories').css('border') === 'none' ) {
[15:12:06] <NitroLiq> It's not triggering my console.log though I can use a different class and target display just fine
[15:12:16] <jquery015> I'll try to end the job and show you the result ;)
[15:12:21] <robertmaxrees> because display and border are different NitroLiq
[15:12:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery015 you're repeating a lot of code there.
[15:12:35] <robertmaxrees> sooo good luck.
[15:12:44] <NitroLiq> Can I not target borders this way?
[15:12:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that none is a valid border value.
[15:13:11] <NitroLiq> tried 0 as well
[15:13:20] <robertmaxrees> try to console log the value instead.
[15:13:22] <NitroLiq> and with two ==
[15:13:32] <robertmaxrees> always use ===
[15:13:37] <NitroLiq> I do
[15:13:45] <robertmaxrees> but using == wouldn't make a difference in this case.
[15:13:46] <NitroLiq> I just wanted to test with truthiness
[15:13:47] <jquery015> I will clean the code when is all working
[15:14:26] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/96fh5zLm/
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> it's an empty string.
[15:14:48] <robertmaxrees> so you can do if (!$('someelem').css('border')) {}
[15:16:05] <NitroLiq> nope still nothing
[15:16:19] <jquery015> anyway, if you have any idea how to simplify it would be great!
[15:16:40] <robertmaxrees> jquery015 i can't simplify if i don't knwo what you're tyring to accomplish, hence the simplified fiddle suggestion.
[15:16:51] <robertmaxrees> NitroLiq https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/96fh5zLm/1/
[15:16:53] <robertmaxrees> works great.
[15:16:59] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got then.
[15:17:00] <jquery015> ok, I understand dude
[15:17:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:18:47] <jquery015> can I do this assign? var x = $(#edit-field-ore-settimanali-ccnl-und-0-value) and then use x.val()?
[15:20:24] <NitroLiq> Take a look here: https://jsfiddle.net/fpjrrfts/1/
[15:22:57] <NitroLiq> Doesn't seem to work with 0 either
[15:23:22] <NitroLiq> I can use the same basic structure and target display easily and it will work
[15:23:47] <NitroLiq> so, I'm guessing it's something to do with border
[15:28:56] <NitroLiq> Ah ha! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8899789/use-jquery-to-check-if-element-has-a-border
[15:32:21] <stanmancan> Any idea how to limit the images to be a max of 800px wide on http://nivel.pw/ ??
[15:32:30] <stanmancan> for the image slider under "portfolio" ?
[15:33:33] <stanmancan> i want the slider itself full width so the icons are wide
[15:33:53] <stanmancan> but if I put a max-width on flexslider it screws it all up
[15:34:18] <stanmancan> the images are stuck between
[16:17:52] <jquery015> is it possible to return all the class of an element with prop?
[17:01:47] <RudyValencia> So I'm having a problem with an AJAX form submitting twice, why does this commonly happen and how do I solve the problem?
[17:04:37] <bronson> Anyone know if it's possible to send the browser to another URL *without* adding the current page to the history?
[17:05:31] <bronson> I have an intermediate "your PDF is rendering page"...  When the PDF is ready, I'd like the browser to load the PDF, and the back button to go to the previous page, not the render page.
[17:07:34] <ngharo> window.location.replace
[17:08:19] <ngharo> maybe not i dunno
[17:09:22] <bronson> ngharo: yes!!  according to the docs, that looks like exactly what I need.  trying now.
[17:17:54] <bronson> and it seems to work.  ngharo, thanks.  I spent all my time looking for a plugin or history extensions, turns out it's been built into the browser this whole time.  :)
[17:37:57] <rubyonrailed> How can I find the selected button from a radio group?  The name of my group is this setting[auto_skip_timeoute], so i'm getting issues using this.  "$('input[name=setting[auto_skip_timeout]]:checked', '#edit_setting_3').val()"
[17:48:48] <RudyValencia> So I'm having a problem with an AJAX form submitting twice, why does this commonly happen and how do I solve the problem?
[17:49:03] <shoky> rubyonrailed:  'input[name="setting[auto_skip_timeout]"]:checked'
[17:49:47] <shoky> RudyValencia: maybe the form submit is not being prevented properly, who knows.. impossible to say without seeing the problem/code

[18:04:45] <jonez> I found a bug that I would like to fix, but my js-foo is not strong enough yet
[18:09:19] <robertmaxrees> do they have a git repo?
[18:11:44] <RudyValencia> shoky: http://hpprx.humanocentric.com/test.wcx <- here's our minimal testcase.
[18:31:44] <shoky> RudyValencia: uhm are you changing it while i'm checking
[18:31:55] <RudyValencia> shoky: I fixed it!
[18:32:02] <shoky> RudyValencia: in any case it seems your formvalidation script was submitting it too
[18:32:07] <shoky> or triggering a submit
[18:32:09] <shoky> ah
[18:32:11] <shoky> cool
[18:32:26] <RudyValencia> We had to add a do-nothing to the formvalidation stack
[18:32:57] <RudyValencia> ... .on('fv.form.success', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }) ...
