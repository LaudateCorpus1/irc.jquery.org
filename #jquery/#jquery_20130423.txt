[00:00:20] <fvdjango> coldhead: Awesome! Thanks!
[00:00:40] <coldhead> fvdjango: this is how i'd more likely do it http://jsfiddle.net/537UB/1/
[00:00:48] <coldhead> so you already have all the JS you'll require
[00:00:50] <coldhead> and call it as needed
[00:00:58] <coldhead> without having to make multiple requests for separate files
[00:01:16] <coldhead> have fun with that
[00:01:33] <fvdjango> ok, awesome
[00:01:43] <fvdjango> much appreciated!

[00:19:48] <boulet101010> i have a problem with ajax calls. the response is prefixed by this character : http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/feff/index.htm
[00:19:56] <boulet101010> every single response
[00:20:21] <boulet101010> so i checked on the php side, but the string is correctly echo'ed
[00:20:49] <boulet101010> i checked with an older version of my website, it doesn't happen
[00:21:22] <boulet101010> so, it's not php, it's not apache, it should be a jquery problem. have you ever experienced this?
[00:23:49] <boulet101010> (tried to change browser too)
[00:29:45] <boulet101010> it seems that the problem comes from Notepad

[00:52:32] <tw2113> cemyal, how is that at all related to jquery?
[00:53:42] <cemyal> tw2113, cuz you need jquery to swap the images onclick
[00:55:46] <Combinu> Does anyone know how to interface a toggle switch which works in javascript and grab the value using a jquery... the toggle switch is a checkbox
[00:56:39] <tw2113> jQuery isn't required for that, just javascript
[00:56:52] <tw2113> it also sounds like an issue you need to seek suppot from limesurvey for
[00:56:57] <tw2113> more than us
[00:57:06] <Combinu> is that to me?
[00:57:56] <tw2113> no, cemyal
[00:59:22] <Combinu> can you see my issue if possible... thanks
[01:13:48] <djQuery> can't figure out why the speed of the animation doesn't change when changing the slider
[01:14:18] <djQuery> I know it wont change until movePuck is called again but that should be after each animation
[01:15:47] <Nebros> good morning. i think i have a little problem with a js. my ie9 set always to compatibility mode, if i run my page. is this possible?
[01:17:45] <djQuery> Nebros, there is some header info in the page to fgorce it into and out of compatablity If I remember corrct
[01:20:29] <Nebros> header info in my page or what?
[01:21:20] <Nebros> i only know, that when i set manually the page into non comp. mode, it looks a bit strange
[01:24:02] <Nebros> im using on the first page a js called jquery.validate.js and i have this style... http://jsfiddle.net/fqVrn/ in use
[01:43:41] <bahamas> how do I determine what is the latest version of jqueryui that works with a certain version of jquery?
[01:44:08] <Cork> bahamas: it's defined on the jquery ui blog (well backwards)
[01:44:58] <bahamas> Cork: thanks
[01:46:29] <Cork> bahamas: but i think jquery ui has been at jquery 1.6 for quite a while
[01:48:56] <bahamas> Cork: you mean that's the oldest version that they support, right?
[01:49:05] <Cork> yes
[01:49:39] <Cork> but wiki might be the most collected information on the matter
[01:49:54] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery_UI#Release_history
[01:50:03] <bahamas> Cork: well, I'm now using jquery 1.7.2 and jqueryui 1.8.18 and my slider is behaving weirdly
[01:50:15] <bahamas> on chromium only
[01:50:29] <Cork> bahamas: can you generate a testcase?
[01:53:28] <bahamas> Cork: I'm actually trying right now to create a jsfiddle, but I'm having some difficulties
[01:57:14] <Bogdaniel> hello i have a problem with this jquery code can't manage making it work with that section of code.. http://jsfiddle.net/Ntrq4/
[01:57:59] <koichirose> Hi, I'd like to upgrade to jQuery 2.0 from 1.7.2, so I also added the migrate plugin. How can I set it to receive more visible notifications in development and to log server-side in production?
[01:58:27] <blackhex> Hello everyone. I have a problem that jQuery Mobile events are not working properly on Sony Xperia LT22i. The solution is to ignore mouse events  and call event.preventDefault() for mouse and touch events. I did this with following code: http://www.pasteall.org/41637. The problem is that I don't know how to call default implementation of touchmove event so that jQuery UI widgets event handling would work.
[01:59:46] <blackhex> Do you know how to call it?
[02:16:41] <jop008> Is tehre a way to detect the click on the right arrrow on a list item?
[02:17:19] <fabioportieri> .click() ?
[02:18:54] <henn1nk> hello guys. is there a nice, quick way to parse an html string to text string? <div class="wiki"><p>...</p><p>...</p></div> would be nice to get the content in <p>..</p>
[02:19:07] <henn1nk> $('.wiki').text() outputs Wiki ...
[02:19:40] <jop008> but how to check it is a click on the right arrow
[02:19:50] <jop008> you don't see it in the html
[02:20:52] <jop008> with an extra div I could arrange it
[02:21:11] <bahamas> Cork: I've managed to create a fiddle. it doesn't look good but it shows the problem http://jsfiddle.net/3sRQz/
[02:21:42] <bahamas> the red bars should be where the slider handle is. unfortunately, I couldn't make only the slider handle red, so the entire handle is red
[02:22:18] <bahamas> henn1nk: use selectors to extract the text between <p>
[02:22:29] <henn1nk> bahamas: selectors?
[02:22:58] <bahamas> henn1nk: $('.wiki p').text()
[02:23:16] <bahamas> or something of that nature
[02:24:01] <bahamas> jop008: what do you mean that you don't see the right arrow in the html? how is it made?
[02:26:32] <henn1nk> bahamas: ok that "works"
[02:26:55] <henn1nk> bahamas: do i receive an array or just an string by this?
[02:27:24] <bahamas> henn1nk: probably array if you have more paragraphs. try it and see
[02:29:48] <henn1nk> bahamas: seems to be just an string
[02:33:38] <bahamas> so, can anyone help me with my fiddle?
[02:36:50] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/jPNyH/ this doesnt work :(
[02:38:09] <henn1nk> ah ok got it
[02:38:11] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/jPNyH/1/
[02:40:20] <vsgill> anyone use scrollTo js ?
[02:44:32] <Cork> bahamas: opps sorry, got busy
[02:46:20] <koichirose> Hi, I'd like to upgrade to jQuery 2.0 from 1.7.2, so I also added the migrate plugin. How can I set it to receive more visible notifications in development and to log server-side in production?
[02:47:59] <Cork> bahamas: should it really be that wide?
[02:54:59] <Cork> koichirose: don't think you can
[02:55:12] <Cork> koichirose: but read the code, it's not that many lines
[02:55:39] <koichirose> Cork: you mean I could implement it myself by editing the jQuery migrate plugin?
[02:56:01] <Cork> koichirose: i meant check the source, there might be a toggle for it
[02:56:11] <koichirose> oh ok. will do
[02:56:19] <Cork> other then that, all you would have to do is overwrite the console.log if nothing else
[02:57:16] <Cork> window.console.log = function() { $.post('/logs.php', { log: JSON.stringify(arguments); } }); };
[03:09:50] <koichirose> Cork: cool, will try. I'm guessing that won't be called in production though, so I could use it in development only
[03:10:06] <koichirose> anyway, how should I rewrite the .toggle(…) method?
[03:10:16] <koichirose> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/warnings.md#jqmigrate-jqueryfntogglehandler-handler-is-deprecated
[03:10:23] <Cork> koichirose: well that would be called in production if something uses console.log
[03:11:09] <Cork> koichirose: simplest is to add the toggle state in a .data() variable
[03:11:12] <Cork> and then just if case it
[03:11:18] <koichirose> Cork: right, but it seems that the production, minified jquery migrate won't log anything, so I guess it's not calling console.log
[03:11:32] <Cork> ah
[03:11:44] <Cork> ya, they might rip out the logging there
[03:12:14] <Cork> well you could just minify it your self and keep the loggin
[03:12:24] <Cork> +g
[03:12:41] <bluesm> Hi.
[03:12:45] <bluesm> If I do:
[03:13:31] <bluesm> $(function() {console.log(1)});  $(function(){console.log(2)});
[03:13:54] <bluesm> Can I be certain that I will get first "1"  and after that "2"  ?
[03:15:15] <Cork> yes
[03:16:27] <vsgill> Hi, I have a one page web using scrollTo js, is there a way I can find out the coordinates of each of my link anchor on load?
[03:16:38] <john2x> what events do I bind for when a popup closes?
[03:16:48] <john2x> (popup created via window.open)
[03:17:14] <Cork> john2x: depends on what popup/dialog your using
[03:17:38] <Cork> ?api position @ vsgill
[03:17:39] <b-ot> vsgill: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[03:18:00] <Cork> alternatively `api offset
[03:18:05] <Cork> oh
[03:18:09] <Cork> `api offset
[03:18:09] <b-ot> Cork: .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[03:18:35] <john2x> @Cork popup created via window.open()
[03:18:37] <bluesm> Cork:  Thanks :)
[03:18:49] <Cork> john2x: ah you mean a new window
[03:20:14] <Cork> john2x: not 100% sure but i think you have to hook events inside the loaded page
[03:21:33] <Cork> john2x: ya, you would have to hook the beforeunload event in the new page
[03:21:52] <Cork> var w = window.open(
[03:21:54] <Cork> 'opps
[03:22:19] <Cork> var w = window.open('url'); w.addEventListener('beforeunload', function() { alert('closed'); });
[03:22:39] <vsgill> Cork: thanks that worked!
[03:30:44] <fvdjango> Hi guys, I am having a problem that I've explained here: http://dpaste.org/O40cA/   Any suggestions?
[03:31:07] <jop008> If I want two buttons at the top right corner how to achieve this?
[03:31:12] <jop008> In div data-role="header" data-theme="b">
[03:34:07] <john2x> Cork: Thanks!
[03:34:21] <Cork> fvdjango: so instead of toggle use addClass and removeClass and handle the other case
[03:34:39] <Cork> john2x: yw
[03:34:55] <Cork> jop008: are you talking about jqm?
[03:35:02] <fvdjango> Cork: So have three functions, one for each section, and depending on what is clicked, turn on hide for 2 and turn off hide for 1?
[03:35:24] <Cork> fvdjango: not really
[03:35:39] <jop008> yep
[03:35:42] <jop008> jjqmobile
[03:36:07] <Cork> i would go with something like $('.togglers').addClass('hide'); $('.target').removeClass('hide');
[03:36:40] <Cork> fvdjango: and all you would have to do is have an if case for what direction to go
[03:36:49] <Cork> hasClass('hide');
[03:37:13] <fvdjango> Cork: Hmm, I think I get it. I'll give it a shot. Thanks
[03:45:17] <harpal> I am adding div using AJAX. I have applied mouseenter and mouseleave events to that div with class defined as 'image-container', I have defined javascript like this http://paste2.org/pWXHMkyp
[03:45:50] <harpal> When page loads it works, but after ajax add new divs its not working on new divs.
[03:51:20] <Cork> harpal: you need to define delegated event listeners
[03:51:37] <Cork> harpal: see ?.delegate and see ?.on
[03:51:38] <bot-t> harpal, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:51:40] <bot-t> harpal, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:56:59] <bluesm> Hi.
[03:57:08] <bluesm> Can I disable event for a moment.
[03:57:16] <bluesm> Then return to the previous state ?
[03:57:18] <harpal> Cork: Thanks a lot, replacing on with delegate solved problem. :D
[03:57:55] <Cork> bluesm: if($(this).data('disabled')) { return; }
[03:58:21] <Cork> and then $(target).data('disabled', true)/false
[04:02:52] <bluesm> Cork: Why you don't assign the variables on DOM object  ? Instead you use the data ? Which could be less efficient ?
[04:04:42] <bluesm1> I had problem with network...
[04:05:00] <Cork> bluesm1: dom varaibles leak
[04:05:04] <Cork> in some browsers
[04:05:42] <Cork> that's actually why .data was created from the beginning
[04:05:59] <Cork> later it has been incorporating the html data- attributes too
[04:06:40] <jop008> How to have 2 buttons in my header at the right side?
[04:06:40] <bluesm1> Cork: Leaking. So even if I delete my "DOM" object my variables would be there...
[04:07:09] <Cork> bluesm1: no, but even if you delete the variable the memory will still be used in the browser
[04:07:40] <bluesm1> Cork: Ok. I understand. Thanks :)
[04:08:17] <Cork> bluesm1: also if you ever deside to add things on the dom make SURE you use the data- prefix
[04:08:39] <Cork> bluesm1: cause else you're in unpredictable waters where new features in the browser can break your code
[04:08:47] <Cork> ...
[04:09:01] <Cork> bluesm: also if you ever deside to add things on the dom make SURE you use the data- prefix
[04:09:04] <Cork> bluesm: cause else you're in unpredictable waters where new features in the browser can break your code
[04:09:37] <Cork> i've helped a silly amount of users where there script broke cause a new html feature has been added in modern browsers
[04:09:46] <Cork> like .list on a dom object or .download or...
[04:10:10] <Cork> so make sure to stay out of that namescope
[04:14:31] <bluesm> Cork: This leaking are probably because if I delete DOM object it isn't really deleted. Right (I mean browser keeps that that node in his internal guts).
[04:15:18] <Cork> bluesm: it's bugs in the dom implementation
[04:15:30] <Cork> bluesm: but the name scope is the big one
[04:15:45] <Cork> cause it makes it risky to work there
[04:16:33] <theresajayne_> i am having problems with canvas, on jsfiddle its not working at all, on my ssytem i get the red bar but not the others... http://jsfiddle.net/JAVVP/

[04:16:56] <theresajayne_> sorry i mean the green bar
[04:17:11] <sacho_> ${
[04:17:25] <sacho_> http://jsfiddle.net/JAVVP/1/
[04:17:27] <theresajayne_> sacho where
[04:17:53] <theresajayne_> oh right not on the page though, but where is the amber and red bars?
[04:18:01] <theresajayne_> i just see the green
[04:18:28] <Cork> theresajayne_: you're using an editor that insert invalid characters, you should look for another one
[04:18:40] <theresajayne_> ???
[04:19:04] <theresajayne_> Cork, why should i throw out Intellij Idea ultimate which is our dev environment
[04:19:22] <sacho_> theresajayne_, your fiddle had a syntax error.
[04:19:23] <Cork> theresajayne_: sorry saw wrong, it was another typo in the page
[04:19:45] <Cork> thought it was hidden invalid character cause i didnt' see the { that should have been a (
[04:19:45] <theresajayne_> I had added a $(document).ready manually
[04:20:03] <sacho_> The reason why you're not seeing the red bar is because it's too far to the right.
[04:20:07] <Cork> and yes the hidden character is a common problem from broken editors
[04:20:30] <theresajayne_> it should only be max 100 pixels wide
[04:20:35] <sunbeam> i've got a complex image that i need to repeat left to right somehow.. any thoughts on how i can best do this?
[04:20:39] <theresajayne_> its a split for percentages
[04:20:39] <sunbeam> its a cut paper
[04:21:30] <theresajayne_> trying to show a traffic light system
[04:21:44] <theresajayne_> i suck at math
[04:22:25] <theresajayne_> there should be a green bar then an orange bar then red
[04:22:29] <theresajayne_> all connected
[04:23:03] <Cork> sounds like what you're looking for is totalWidth * (maybePercent / 100)
[04:23:22] <theresajayne_> ah! thanks
[04:23:35] <theresajayne_> its been many years since i did o level math
[04:23:52] <JohnBo> I have an ul that has a class called .show. When .show is toggled it shows, obviously :) In a completly different span is a menu-icon. Id like to change the css-prop: color when the ul has the class .show. Is there anyone who could point me in the right direction? Not very experienced in jquery. Cheers
[04:27:20] <Cork> JohnBo: are you looking for something like ul.show > span.icon {} ?
[04:28:10] <theresajayne_> also how can you define the size of the canvas?
[04:28:26] <sacho_> the same as any html element
[04:28:40] <Cork> width="" height=""
[04:30:10] <theresajayne_> ok looks like the fillrect is relative is that right?
[04:31:18] <theresajayne_> why am i getting this gap? http://jsfiddle.net/JAVVP/2/
[04:33:50] <theresajayne_> just looks like the middle fill isnt happening
[04:34:17] <theresajayne_> doh!
[04:34:26] <theresajayne_> need to add the start to the width
[04:34:39] * theresajayne_ bangs head agains adjacent brick wall
[04:35:36] <JohnBo> Cork: Im not sure really. I just need the spans css to change when the ul has the class .show attached. (The .show-class being added onClick by jquery)

[05:31:29] <Nebros> i put them into a validator and was shocked. but they are not mine and i think the creator of this js know what he did... ^^
[05:31:34] <seutje> I dunno how to fix that, aside from making the calls less long
[05:31:53] <jop008> How can I shift my labels to the right a bit?
[05:32:02] <jop008> now they are close to zero x
[05:32:19] <dokma> I could implement a shared memory placeholder and signal the process to die from beforeunload that way
[05:38:44] <grek> hi is possible to have static content on jquery tabs but unload content - in firefox, movie embeded on second tab autostar.
[05:38:47] <grek> aurtostart
[05:39:12] <grek> i have idea to on init clear all content, copy it to memory and on change put contnet
[05:39:24] <grek> is good idea ? or is possible to do it simpler ?
[05:41:03] <grek> chrome self dont allow to play inactive content but firefox play it
[05:42:16] <Niels___> this function works, the post works, the data gets sent and executed in the backend, but i can't get anything to alert or what not, any clues? what have i missed? http://pastebin.com/aR210BVj
[05:44:07] <Nebros> Lexical error at line 1, column 2. Encountered: "(" (40), after : "$"        My line:   $(document).ready(function(){   what does this error mean?
[05:44:27] <Nebros> or what i have to do?
[05:45:10] <skinofstars> Nebros: you included jQuery first, right?
[05:46:30] <Nebros> yes
[05:47:57] <Nebros> where can i find a validator for special js?
[05:48:40] <Nebros> i did the validate with a css tester... ^^
[06:03:06] <DaniG2k> guys I have a Drupal website with a block I'd like to hide until the page loads
[06:03:21] <DaniG2k> I'm a jquery noob so I'm wondering what's the best way to do this
[06:06:48] <h22> A get request to a URI returns a json response . So, what should I use to send the request? $.get or $.getJSON?
[06:10:59] <skinofstars> pretty sure $.get should be fine
[06:12:47] <aaronmcadam> ?getJSON
[06:13:03] <aaronmcadam> no more bot :(
[06:18:45] <Nebros> what are reason, that ie9 load js only in compatibility mode and chrome / ff want load it?
[06:20:29] <gnarf> `api jQuery.getJSON
[06:20:29] <b-ot> gnarf: jQuery.getJSON(): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:25:01] <asdfz0mg> I just learned a way to animate the increment between two values using the jQuery animate method and I'd just like to share it with you
[06:25:03] <asdfz0mg> http://jsfiddle.net/F4YPY/3/
[06:25:46] <asdfz0mg> With easing, duration and all :)
[06:26:51] <Ankabout> can anyone explain to me why this doesn't work?
[06:26:51] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/h9fbd/
[06:27:28] <Ankabout> oops, updated, made a mistake with copying my code
[06:27:33] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/h9fbd/1/
[06:28:24] <Ankabout> still doesn't work though
[06:32:28] <Illusioneer> So I have been playing with jquery and noticed the following behavior: I can't add new dom elements (via appendto) unless it's nested inside of the $(document).ready... however once I add these elements dynamically I can't seem to remove them via the remove() function, inside or outside of doc.ready, what am I doing wrong or not doing?
[06:34:11] <asdfz0mg> Ankabout, it doesn't work because you are trying to bind and event to #test.open when it doesn't exist.
[06:34:49] <Ankabout> asdfz0mg, in the previous function I'm adding the .open.   doesn't that make it exist?
[06:35:28] <Schonert> Im trying to prevent default if element doesn't have the class 'additional'. but my e.targert seem to give me an object, not a single item
[06:35:44] <asdfz0mg> You're trying to bind the event before the element has the class .open
[06:36:01] <asdfz0mg> Therefore #test.open doesn't select anything and doesn't get the click event
[06:36:25] <Ankabout> but if I click the h2 once, that function has run right? and then it does have the open class
[06:39:25] <Ankabout> ahhh wait, it loads on document ready
[06:39:28] <Ankabout> and then it's not there yet
[06:39:54] <harpal> in jQuery.ajax method I am getting error TypeError: i is undefined I have dataType : 'json' in ajax call.
[06:44:02] <asdfz0mg> Ankabout, http://jsfiddle.net/h9fbd/2/
[06:44:34] <asdfz0mg> I do the check inside the click event instead
[06:44:39] <Ankabout> asdfz0mg, oh cool thanks!!
[06:44:54] <Ankabout> I'll read up a bit more on the .on
[06:46:17] <asdfz0mg> .click uses the .on method behind the scene
[06:46:24] <asdfz0mg> it's basically an alias
[06:50:21] <grek>  try $('#el').empty() and have error No Embedding Target
[06:50:26] <grek> element exists
[06:59:26] <alex88> hi guys, I'm using the blueimp jquery plugin, rails returns code 422 and the fail event is triggered, but data.result is empty, even if server returns a json, any idea?
[07:00:42] <andrewgearhart> howdy folks. I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong here... and ... its just not clicking... http://jsfiddle.net/st4CR/ I'm attempting to remove the span tag and everything in it as defined in the variable sValue.
[07:05:04] <pressureman> hi folks, i'm stuck on a problem with content loading in an inactive tab having the wrong width. i've read about the "off-left technique", but this doesn't seem to work anymore with jquery ui 1.10 (possibly also 1.9), because the inactive tabs don't have the ui-tabs-hide class applied
[07:06:17] <pressureman> in fact there seems to be no class applied to hidden tabs that i could abuse for the purposes of this off-left technique
[07:09:37] <pressureman> does anybody know of an updated "off-left technique" that will work with jquery ui 1.10 tabs?
[07:12:07] <bahamas> Cork: I managed to find the problem in the end. it was because of CSS, a line that was messing with the width, I think
[07:19:02] <ChrisLE> Hi, I have a little test for your. It works only in Firefox and not in Chrome, IE, Safari, Opera... but I cant understand why? oO. http://jsbin.com/ilomap/3/edit. Expected value = true (Only in FF). In Chrome this error comes up: Uncaught TypeError: Object TestButton has no method 'contains'  Yeah I can read but I cant understand why it happens, because I use jQuery 1.9.1
[07:22:21] <Lemsip> Could anyone offer a fresh pair of eyes for this?  I'm making a Google Chrome extension and I'm trying to activate a button in a Google+ Hangout - particularly the mute button or the exit button.  I've targeted it in since it has an [aria-label], but I can't seem to trigger the button click though .trigger('click') or such.
[07:25:14] <jop008> Anyone with code for delete items from a listview?
[07:25:37] <jop008> An exampel how to implement this using split ?
[07:28:07] <Ankabout> the ability to add a duration to "toggleClass", since what version of Jquery UI is that?
[07:28:09] <Ankabout> I have 1.8.7 and it doesn't seem to work...
[07:29:42] <alex88> ajax call .fail() method will get the json in the result attribute?
[07:29:48] <alex88> since it has just responseText
[07:31:03] <BillCriswell> Ankabout: That seems weird. toggleClass just toggles a class name as far as I know?
[07:31:25] <Ankabout> yeah, but you can add a duration so it animates, but that doesn't want to work for me
[07:32:19] <BillCriswell> Ankabout: with jQuery UI you can animate between classes. I don't think you can with just jQuery.
[07:32:29] <alex88> I've set dataType to json
[07:32:48] <Ankabout> I have UI installed, so it should work, the code works fine in jsfiddle, but that's a different query ui version
[07:34:15] <BillCriswell> Ankabout: .switchClass() maybe?
[07:34:28] <Z3R0> good ole BillCriswell
[07:34:57] <BillCriswell> I'm venturing out of my comfort zone. Never really used jQeury UI haha.
[07:36:11] <Z3R0> oooo I have
[07:36:13] <Z3R0> what's theissue?
[07:36:23] <alex88> anyone?
[07:36:53] <tubbo> bleh jQuery UI
[07:36:53] <tubbo> :D
[07:37:00] <Z3R0> what's the issue ?
[07:37:05] <Z3R0> I wasn't in chat when it all began
[07:37:17] <BillCriswell> He was asking about a duration for "toggleClass", but I don't think you can.. unless it like.. writes a character of the class name over a period of time.
[07:37:17] * tubbo neither...but can also aid in jQ UI questionings
[07:37:33] <tubbo> a duration?
[07:37:40] <BillCriswell> So I think he needed switchClass()
[07:38:03] <Ankabout> sorry phone call
[07:38:05] <Z3R0> a duration ?
[07:38:18] <pressureman> argh... i found the commit in jquery ui 1.8 where they stopped adding the class "ui-tabs-hide" to inactive tabs, and thus killed the ability to use the off-left technique
[07:38:47] <ChrisLE> ok problem solved. Javascript 1.8.6 comes with new String functions and one of them is contains and FF is the only one at the moment who sopports js 1.8.6
[07:39:22] <tubbo> Ankabout: toggleClass doesn't accept a duration...but why can't you just setTimeout(function() { $(something).toggleClass('class-name'); }, 500);?
[07:39:30] <tubbo> Ankabout: that will run toggleClass after 500ms
[07:39:39] <Ankabout> tubbo: http://api.jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[07:39:45] <Ankabout> there it says it does accept a duration
[07:39:59] <Ankabout> and it works here: http://jsfiddle.net/mtNvE/
[07:40:01] <tubbo> Ankabout: ah, well then in that case it's much easier :) i guess jQ UI must override toggleClass. that's annoying. :)
[07:40:18] <Ankabout> hehe
[07:40:52] <tubbo> Ankabout: cool, looks like you got your question answered. just tried that on jQuery 1.7/jQuery UI 1.8 and it didn't work
[07:41:10] <Ankabout> tubbo, thanks, then at least I know the reason :)
[07:41:15] <Ankabout> will upgrade to UI 10
[07:41:15] <amph1bius> is there a substitute for jquery tmpl since it wasn't included ?
[07:41:18] <tubbo> Ankabout: you need jQuery 1.8.3 and jQuery UI 1.9.2 it seems
[07:41:30] <BillCriswell> That sounds fun.
[07:41:41] <tubbo> Ankabout: couldn't hurt to always use the latest version. just remember you check out the API changes between jQuery 1.8 => 1.9
[07:41:46] <tubbo> Ankabout: tl;dr no more live()
[07:42:00] <tubbo> amph1bius: i like http://handlebarsjs.com/ ;-)
[07:43:59] <amph1bius> thanks tubbo !
[07:44:22] <BillCriswell> amph1bius: It really depends on the complexity of the templates in my experience. Mustache for simple stuff, Handlebars for the more difficult... bare bones I like underscores template http://underscorejs.org/#template
[07:45:00] <amph1bius> i need to learn to use underscore
[07:45:07] <amph1bius> a girl here introduced me to it and she swears b it
[07:45:08] <amph1bius> *by
[07:45:45] <BillCriswell> It beats the hell out of dealing with old IE.
[07:46:23] <BillCriswell> A good size, too.
[07:46:50] <jop008> Anyone with a good delete.png?
[07:47:09] <BillCriswell> http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=delete
[07:47:09] <jop008> to use in a listview
[07:47:32] <jop008> Good tip!
[07:48:32] <Z3R0> jop008 google ?
[07:50:39] <Illusioneer> Why can't I use the remove() function on a element that I have appended (ie one that was not part of the HTML at ready)
[07:51:08] <alex88> is normal that ajax error data doesn't show the result? just the json as text in responseText?
[07:51:14] <BillCriswell> Illusioneer: That sounds weird.
[07:51:39] <BillCriswell> alex88: If there's an error it means it probably can't get the result.
[07:52:17] <alex88> BillCriswell: server response is {"user":[{"type":"blank"}]} which is a valid json, just the error code is 422
[07:52:34] <BillCriswell> Illusioneer: http://jsbin.com/uzulap/1/edit this works.
[07:54:22] <Ankabout> tubbo, it seems my problem is query 1.8.2
[07:54:35] <Ankabout> because even with ui 1.10 it doesn't work
[07:55:13] <last1> anyone used the fileupload module ?
[07:55:17] <tubbo> Ankabout: well on your jsFiddle, you were using jQuery 1.8.3 and jQuery UI 1.9.2... http://jsfiddle.net/mtNvE/
[07:55:24] <BillCriswell> alex88: What is you do dataType: 'html'?
[07:55:26] <tubbo> Ankabout: and it worked there. so if i were you i'd just use that..
[07:55:29] <BillCriswell> What if*
[07:55:37] <Ankabout> yeah, my dev environment has 1.8
[07:55:45] <alex88> BillCriswell: well actually the webservice returns 200 in case of html..
[07:55:56] <Ankabout> 1.8.2 I mean
[07:56:56] <Illusioneer> Bill/others - what I am doing is a event tied to a element (div/h1/a/p/etc) that will append a element (a/h1/etc) to a div or table but when it is dynamically created that element can't be removed via the remove() function
[07:57:20] <BillCriswell> alex88: Hard to debug that without messing around with it. Lots of little weird things it can be.
[07:57:25] <Illusioneer> The elements that were already part of the page at load time however can be removed just fine
[07:57:45] <BillCriswell> alex88: You can do var data = $.parseJSON( resultAsHtml ); but that's not clean.
[07:58:00] <alex88> BillCriswell: exactly, it should parse json as in success
[07:58:58] <Illusioneer> http://jsbin.com/uzulap/2/
[07:59:10] <BillCriswell> alex88: It sounds like something isn't cogifured properly server side. If you set it as json do the headers say the result is application/json?
[07:59:43] <alex88> BillCriswell: yup... btw, it's a file upload, that could matter?
[08:00:12] <clarkk> how can I queue a set of actions on a cached set of dom objects, and then update the dom all in one go?
[08:00:13] <alex88> oh wait, I've tested also without file upload
[08:00:19] <alex88> let me try to find a test case
[08:01:36] <BillCriswell> clarkk: You can manipulate the cached set all you want then just append it when you're all ready.
[08:02:35] <clarkk> BillCriswell: what if I selected a set of doms using their class. Changed the contents of some, changed attribute of others, and deleted others?
[08:02:50] <alex88> BillCriswell: can't find any online paste service that lets me use custom ajax response with error
[08:02:54] <alex88> :(
[08:03:08] <alex88> btw response Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
[08:04:14] <BillCriswell> clarkk: You can do that all to a clone of them and keep the original on the page... I think that's what's being asked.
[08:04:44] <Agemaniac> Hello all :)
[08:04:57] <clarkk> BillCriswell: do you have an example/tutorial, please? I don't know what to look for
[08:06:43] <Agemaniac> im loading the content of a page with ajax, and once its loaded, the page "grows", and i can scroll up and down, so i have places a go to top button, but it doesnt work :(
[08:07:17] <Agemaniac> im doing jQuery("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 600);
[08:07:24] <Agemaniac> but it just wont even move
[08:07:28] <Agemaniac> any idea why? :(
[08:07:54] <BillCriswell> clarkk: http://jsbin.com/oqafov/1/edit does this help?
[08:08:32] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/oqafov/2/edit a little cleaner.
[08:10:05] <BillCriswell> clarkk: It seems like you actually want a template though?
[08:12:46] <Matip> Hi
[08:12:54] <Matip> $(window).hashchange(function(data){console.log("DONE!")})     ->     TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'hashchange'
[08:12:56] <Matip> what's the problem?
[08:13:08] <Matip> I think I used .hashchange many times, now it doesn't want to work.. for some reason
[08:13:27] <BillCriswell> Matip: It appears to be a plugin.
[08:13:49] <Matip> hmn, weird. let me check the code again in a project it's working
[08:14:10] <amph1bius> should i be putting somehting like this into a template: https://gist.github.com/amph1bius/c2b75a2811ee09135244
[08:14:15] <amph1bius> if it's just a one off situation
[08:14:46] <BillCriswell> Matip: I could have been wrong. How about $(window).on('hashchange', ... );
[08:16:09] <chinoto> it doesn't appear to be a problem: I have a line that says "$('<li/>',{msa_id:v.msa_id})", but when I use Firefox's "View Selection Source" (which shows the processed html), it shows up as "$('<li></li>',{msa_id:v.msa_id})". Should I be giving jquery the close tag for tags that aren't supposed to self-close?
[08:16:34] <Matip> you're right, it's a plugin!
[08:16:46] <BillCriswell> Matip: Ah, sweet.
[08:17:08] <clarkk> BillCriswell: I'm afraid that example doesn't really demonstrate what I meant. Sorry that I can't explain it better. I have a very simple bit of code, but I am not sure even that will help.   http://jsfiddle.net/r4dBQ/2/
[08:21:09] <BillCriswell> clarkk: Not following 100%. Do you want to remove elements and save them for later basically?
[08:22:07] <clarkk> BillCriswell: no, I just want to perform the actions to the objects in the variable, and then update the dom
[08:22:41] <Matip> I can't find any updated hashchange plugin, the one I used in this project is 3 years old and haven't been maintained
[08:25:35] <BillCriswell> clarkk: so like.. myDivs.addClass('red') ?
[08:25:51] <_cyclops_> Hi, i'm using jquery 1.6.4 and doing a ajax request to a file. But, MSIE seems to try to parse the file. is there an option to disabled that?
[08:28:39] <clarkk> BillCriswell: in this example, I want to query the dom for the objects with the class "test" and store it in myDivs, then remove the object with the id "mandarin" from myDivs, then update the dom using myDivs
[08:30:28] <antoon> Hi dear users of jQuery. Before I dive right into learning about this, I have a small question. Is it possible to create a slideshow (using jQuery) that loops X pictures over and over again (showing 3 at a time) and have them clickable? Sorry in advance if this question falls into the category of top-3-retarded-questions-of-this-week.
[08:32:06] <PerlWebDev> antoon, sounds like something one would do with jCarousel
[08:32:38] <andrewgearhart> antoon: http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/
[08:32:47] <antoon> I did indeed describe some sort of carousel
[08:32:50] <antoon> Cheers mates
[08:35:25] <_cyclops_> Hi, i'm using jquery 1.6.4 and doing a ajax request to a file. But, MSIE seems to try to parse the file. is there an option to disabled that?
[08:36:08] <EdwardIII> hrm, i'm showing bootstrap tooltips with errorPlacements which works great, but i can't get rid of it when they add nice data?
[08:36:42] <clarkk> hmm, I'm still not clear, I'm afraid
[08:36:49] <clarkk> BillCriswell: ^^
[08:37:33] <clarkk> on another topic, could someone explain the difference between var myDivs = $('.test'); and var $myDivs = $('.test'); please?
[08:37:50] <BillCriswell> The $ usually indicates it's a jQuery object.
[08:38:23] <clarkk> BillCriswell: how does that help compared with just a standard var (or object) ?
[08:38:47] <BillCriswell> I see the $ and think jQuery.
[08:38:51] <skinofstars> clarkk: it's just a convention
[08:39:01] <EdwardIII> wonder where validate removes the error class from the object? if i could hook into that i'd be laughing
[08:39:07] <clarkk> skinofstars: ah so it has no additional effect?
[08:39:13] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[08:39:26] <clarkk> hmm, I see
[08:39:31] <skinofstars> clarkk: no, but we often do that so we know it's a jquery object
[08:39:56] <clarkk> interesting. Thanks for that skinofstars and BillCriswell :)
[08:51:48] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. Just playing with .load - http://paste.kde.org/730658 and im getting the error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'load' of undefined " in my chrome console. This seems pretty simple but maybe im missing something?
[08:53:46] <hazamonzo> Thoughts? :)
[08:55:48] <ftj> hazamonzo: #c1 is definitely getting added to the DOM before load gets called?
[08:56:41] <hazamonzo> ftj: It is yeah. http://wstaw.org/m/2013/04/23/plasma-desktopsf1900.png
[08:57:05] <skinofstars> hazamonzo: that may still be being added after
[08:57:42] <hazamonzo> skinofstars: I would be wrong in thinking that the order of this code snippet defines the order in how its loaded then?
[08:58:19] <ftj> hazamonzo: Sometimes.
[08:58:21] <skinofstars> hazamonzo: i wouldn't totally rely on that. if you want to make certain, then look at deferreds
[08:58:41] * hazamonzo googles deferreds
[08:58:48] <NoiseEee> hazamonzo: he means require.js
[08:59:08] <NoiseEee> http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html @ hazamonzo
[08:59:17] * hazamonzo looks
[08:59:52] <the-noob> hi, I know this is not a jquery problem but I'm sure people here had it
[09:00:18] <the-noob> I have a design with a fix width, 460px .. I've added to the header <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />
[09:00:39] <hazamonzo> hmm, so how might i rewrite this small snippet to ensure that the #c1 is loaded before mu .load call?
[09:00:58] <the-noob> but when looking at the page on mobile (portrait) I still need to zoom out a bit
[09:03:10] <ftj> hazamonzo: After your .after(html)
[09:03:20] <NET||abuse> hi folks,, there seems to be no solution to getting jq ui sliders working with touch interfaces, including using touch-punch. to make them draggable
[09:03:24] <hazamonzo> ftj: aye i am looking at .done
[09:03:28] <NET||abuse> doesn anyone know of a way?
[09:03:29] <ftj> hazamonzo: add .each(function() { [[ your code here ]] );
[09:03:54] <NET||abuse> or am i just going to have to re-write some elements of my interfaces with some other library?
[09:04:04] <ftj> hazamonzo: Oops. Left out a curly, but you get the idea. You can use each in this case as a sort of hacky callback.
[09:04:24] <hazamonzo> ftj: Okay! That gives me something to work with :)
[09:04:47] <ftj> hazamonzo: Let me know how it goes.
[09:04:53] <hazamonzo> ftj: I will cheers!
[09:05:02] <hazamonzo> just reading http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[09:05:49] <afoeder> Hi there
[09:06:18] <afoeder> a short question, I didn't even find something at stackoverflow; is there a convenient method in jQuery which basically does this? http://mootools.net/docs/core/Types/Object#Object:Object-contains
[09:07:24] <ftj> afoeder: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[09:07:50] <afoeder> but that does not work for plain {} objects, no?
[09:07:59] <PerlWebDev> NET||abuse: how does jquery know the difference between a finger and the mouse?
[09:08:37] <PerlWebDev> NET||abuse: sounds more like a sensitivity issue with the touch interface for determining where the "mouse" is
[09:14:02] <hazamonzo> Dang...
[09:15:42] <jop008> I have a complicated list item in a list view and the record id is at li level
[09:15:57] <jop008> the code to get to the id is like this  $("#listview").click (function(e) {
[09:15:57] <jop008>    alert (e.target.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.nodeName);
[09:15:58] <jop008>    alert (clientID);
[09:16:21] <jop008> can this be done simpeler I want to reach out to element li upwards
[09:16:21] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[09:16:35] <BillCriswell> jop008: .closest('li') ?
[09:16:51] <jop008> like this. e.target.closest (
[09:17:23] <BillCriswell> $(e.target).closest('li') would get the first li it comes across going up the DOM
[09:19:06] <jop008> I try it
[09:19:51] <jop008> what is the return value of closest a node?
[09:21:59] <jop008> when I use    node = $(e.target).closest('li')
[09:22:00] <jop008>    clientID = node.getAttribute ("id");
[09:22:11] <jop008> node has od method getattribute
[09:25:48] <NoiseEee> jop008: $.attr()
[09:26:01] <NoiseEee> or $.prop()
[09:26:20] <jop008> $attr('id')
[09:26:22] <jop008> dus
[09:29:17] <jop008>   node = $(e.target).closest('li' and then hw to use .$attr())
[09:29:18] <jop008>  
[09:29:45] <NoiseEee> jop008: wat
[09:29:58] <NoiseEee> jop008: this is pretty basic stuff; perhaps you should do an intro or something?
[09:30:06] <jop008> i am a newbie
[09:30:16] <Bower^Work> anyone had problems with blueimp's jquery file uploader when trying to POST large files? the POST data is blank and the upload process never completes
[09:30:31] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: perhaps your backend doesn't like such a large upload?
[09:30:58] <Bower^Work> NoiseEee: I've made changes to the php.ini file to accommodate for the large files. it never actually receives my script..it's rather odd
[09:31:08] <Bower^Work> never hits my script*
[09:31:57] <NoiseEee> what's the XHR tab of your browser console showing?
[09:32:54] <jop008> like this $node = $(e.target).closest('li');
[09:32:54] <jop008>    clientID = $node.attr("id");
[09:33:30] <jop008> cool thing closest
[09:33:53] <NoiseEee> always use 'var'.
[09:34:00] <NoiseEee> var clientID = $node.prop('id')
[09:34:05] <High_Noon> ben_alman can you help out with a BBQ issue we are having
[09:34:07] <Bower^Work> NoiseEee: if you mean the console tab for say firebug (excuse my ignorance), it shows the request is fired but it shows the spinning disc. the POST tab is empty
[09:34:50] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: i'd maybe var_dump some stuff on the backend and see if its receving it at all, what to do etc... you know xhr uploads aren't in $_POST right?
[09:35:18] <Bower^Work> NoiseEee: that's the thing..it never reaches the script. works absolutely fine for smaller files
[09:35:46] <NoiseEee> then it sounds like an issue with php, either file or $_POST size requests... did you restart your server after .ini changes?
[09:36:10] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: empty $_POST usually means max_post_size has been exceeded ##php
[09:36:16] <High_Noon> @ben_alman, can you help out with a BBQ issue we are having?
[09:37:48] <Bower^Work> NoiseEee: i did reset the server and phpinfo() is showing these changes. yes i have experienced an empty $_POST array when the file exceeds the max in the past but i'm not entirely convinced this is the cause as it never reaches the script (i.e. i would expect it to dump an empty array..just doesn't make contact with the script for that to happen)
[09:38:11] <jackw411> http://pastebin.com/gMJA9sni - guys I have this happening front and backend... but when I pageview I get $.fn.goldenGame.init is undefined. any ideas of how I can debug why this isn't happening?
[09:38:20] <Bower^Work> i'll have another look at my php.ini changes..you seem to know your stuff and if nothing springs to mind frontend wise, it probably is a php setting
[09:38:54] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: $_POST is entirely discarded when post_max_size has been exceeded.
[09:42:03] <jackw411> http://pastebin.com/gMJA9sni - guys I have this happening front and backend... but when I view page I get $.fn.goldenGame.init is undefined in console.. any ideas?
[09:43:31] <Bower^Work> NoiseEee: i've replaced the var_dump with a simple echo then it dies. when i upload with a small file, i get back a response with the echo. when i upload with a large file, it behaves as i've described
[09:43:44] <SetiaDiem> i'm working on a tutorial that assumes 1.6.3. i'm using 1.9.1. in the tutorial, in an object literal for animate(), the backgroundColor property works if using 1.6.3 but not if using 1.9.1.... the jQuery site doesn't indicate that it's removed from use.... so what might be the problem?
[09:44:18] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: again, read what i've typed
[09:44:38] <Bower^Work> i fail to see how that's relevant when it doesn't even reach the script
[09:45:19] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: what does " i've replaced the var_dump with a simple echo then it dies." mean?
[09:45:44] <Bower^Work> original: var_dump($_POST) current: echo 'test'; die;
[09:45:47] <jackw411> NoiseEee : i think he means hes echo ; die;
[09:46:24] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: and you never get "test"? are there filesize limits in your <input file> tag or whatever?
[09:46:43] <Bower^Work> i never get "test" with a large file but i do get "test" with smaller files
[09:46:54] <jackw411> jesus wept
[09:49:10] <Bower^Work> jackw411: what?
[09:49:14] <shoky> SetiaDiem are you using jquery-color plugin? or jquery-ui? because jquery alone doesn't do color animation. if yer using jquery-color you should prolly just use a newer version
[09:50:23] <NoiseEee> Bower^Work: does that plugin limit file sizes somewhere?
[09:50:25] <SetiaDiem> shoky, thank you i'll try updating the plugin right now
[09:50:50] <Bower^Work> NoiseEee: no. rather annoyingly i just tested it in chrome and it works..
[09:51:08] <NoiseEee> weird
[09:52:02] <shoky> jackw411: those functions don't belong in $.fn (that's for adding functionality to jquery objects)
[09:52:33] <shoky> jackw411: and anyway doing $.fn.a.b = c;  won't work at all if $.fn.a isn't defined
[09:52:45] <shoky> and it's not recommended either way
[09:53:01] <jackw411> $.fn.goldenGame = function() { }; ^ is defined, i just didn't include it in the pastebin
[09:53:19] <shoky> why is it in $.fn ?
[09:53:50] <Bower^Work> well thanks for your hepl NoiseEee
[09:53:54] <Bower^Work> much appreciated
[09:53:59] <Bower^Work> help*
[09:55:38] <blittle> I think there might be a bug in jquery core
[09:55:46] <Bower^Work> bold statement
[09:55:47] <NoiseEee> np Bower^Work good luck!
[09:55:53] <jackw411> shoky
[09:56:29] <blittle> lol
[09:56:37] <blittle> look at this fiddle
[09:56:39] <blittle> works in 1.9
[09:56:41] <blittle> fails in 2.0
[09:56:41] <blittle> http://jsfiddle.net/HTa6D/2/
[09:57:10] <NoiseEee> blittle: works fine?
[09:57:21] <shoky> why does that make you think there's a bug in jquery core..
[09:57:44] <SetiaDiem> shoky, that did it. thanks again
[09:57:54] <blittle> .data('uiAutocomplete') should return the same thing as .data('ui-autocomplete') right?
[09:58:50] <shoky> blittle:  depends on the version
[09:59:24] <jackw411> shoky what im trying to achieve is that the object i returned from jQuery.fn.init has access to all jQueries methods
[09:59:26] <blittle> so I assume it is working as expected in 2.0
[10:00:00] <shoky> blittle: it's not about jquery version, it's about jquery-ui version
[10:00:10] <shoky> blittle: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#changed-naming-convention-for-data-keys
[10:01:03] <shoky> jackw411: donno what you mean
[10:02:18] <blittle> shoky: I was speaking to the jquery-ui guys about it, and definitely uiAutocomplete is incorrect...but the question is, should core still be returning the same result
[10:02:22] <jackw411> its for ease of updating down the line etc. read: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/jquery-en/K9aNKgW4PtM
[10:02:25] <blittle> even if it is still incorrect
[10:02:43] <shoky> blittle: donno wat yer talking about.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/HTa6D/3/
[10:03:02] <dcherman> if it's admittedly incorrect, why would you expect a result?  just fix your code
[10:03:33] <jackw411> also shoky: i fixed it, thanks for your questions they helped answer my problem thinking about it in my head :)
[10:03:40] <blittle> it isn't my code, it is document cloud visualsearch's code
[10:03:46] <blittle> I will report it to them
[10:03:51] <blittle> and/or do a pull request to fix it
[10:04:06] <blittle> but my understanding was that .data() should return the same thing whether it is camelcase or dashed
[10:04:44] <blittle> so, this isn't me trying to force a fix for this particular problem, visualsearch needs to be fixed, I figured I would ask if this was also a problem in core
[10:04:52] <blittle> perhaps not
[10:05:13] <blittle> I don't think .data() should do magic in what it returns
[10:05:21] <shoky> where is it doing magic?
[10:07:16] <blittle> if it is translating the data "key" to something else, that is magic
[10:08:24] <blittle> really it comes down to the question, should .data() return the same thing for camelcase and dashed
[10:08:40] <dcherman> blittle: it depends on how it's set
[10:08:41] <blittle> .data('some-data') and .data('someData')
[10:09:06] <clarkk> sorry, back to the question of using the $variable convention...  if I don't use this convention, is it frowned-upon? Are there plenty of people who don't use it?
[10:09:15] <dcherman> ui is setting the key as a literal "ui-autocomplete" and not going through $.fn.data, but rather $.data
[10:09:18] <drager> Is there any easy way to let a user switch between stylesheets?
[10:09:26] <shoky> clarkk: many people don't use it
[10:09:31] <dcherman> $.data does none of the naming magic of $.fn.data
[10:09:45] <clarkk> ok thank you shoky. I'm not keen on it, so I won't either :)
[10:10:38] <dcherman> you could argue that ui should use $.fn.data, but in the end if they say that only ui-autocomplete is a valid key, then that's what you've gotta use
[10:12:52] <blittle> sounds like I am confused about the difference between $.data and $.fn.data
[10:12:56] <blittle> need to go read up a little
[10:17:31] <antoon> Thanks PerlWebDev :)
[10:20:51] <dragongun100> Hello
[10:21:00] <theresajayne_> goodbye
[10:21:16] <dragongun100> anyone speak German ?
[10:21:32] <theresajayne_> ich sprache nur ein bissen deutch
[10:21:42] <dragongun100> nice :D
[10:21:48] <jop008> Can you do tis on a readonly field $("#formID")[0].value = iformID;
[10:22:13] <jop008> my iformid is the new recordid
[10:24:13] <sterlo> Anyone familiar with reordering multiple list items within ULs? I'm having a FAIL moment: https://gist.github.com/grok/cb76415d53bb20a3f80e
[10:24:19] <drager> Is there any easy way to let a user switch between stylesheets?
[10:24:33] <drager> and to have a fallback to the default stylesheet
[10:26:33] <sterlo> I'm selecting all ULs...then using $,each to go through them...but when i do li.detach().sort() it appends all the LIs to the very last UL...
[10:26:35] <sterlo> WHHHYYYY
[10:26:39] * sterlo facedesk
[10:34:03] <sterlo> Solved
[10:34:19] <Cork> sterlo: try using $(this).append instead of the ul index thing
[10:34:48] <sterlo> Cork: thanks - but it turns out i was being derp at line #3 - it was using li.children(...)
[10:34:49] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[10:34:57] <sterlo> instead of $(value).children(...)
[10:35:04] <Cork> :)
[10:35:14] <sterlo> so i was doing a $.each on ul...then referenced ul inside the each and I started throwing a hissy fit
[10:35:23] <Cork> ya
[10:35:30] <sterlo> its all good now
[10:35:31] <jop008> I have an image with an alt text but the alt text is notshown
[10:35:58] <Cork> jop008: alt is for when the image is missing; are you sure you're not looking for title="" ?
[10:36:21] <jop008> good help!
[10:36:35] <drager> Is there any easy way to let a user switch between stylesheets? And have a fallback to the default stylesheet if ther user doesnt have js
[10:37:03] <Cork> drager: that's built into most browsers
[10:37:16] <drager> Cork: Yeah ofc, but a fallback is always good
[10:37:22] <drager> for old browsers
[10:37:39] <BillCriswell> drager: $('#theme-css').attr('href', 'theme.css');
[10:38:10] <Cork> drager: what i meant is set a stylesheet with a title, and then add another with a different title
[10:38:19] <Cork> drager: the first will be loaded as the "default"
[10:38:24] <Cork> and all browsers will load it
[10:38:30] <Cork> the second will be the alternative one
[10:39:08] <drager> Cork: You mean, link the default one for browsers without js?
[10:39:41] <Cork> drager: link both
[10:39:59] <Cork> the browsers has built in support for different "themes"
[10:40:04] <MaxSan> hmmm
[10:40:16] <MaxSan> how can i make jquery submit two forms at the same time
[10:40:22] <drager> Cork: And how should I determin which one to use?
[10:40:32] <BillCriswell> MaxSan: $('.foo, .bar').trigger('submit')
[10:40:36] <MaxSan> feel like im going in circles with this ><
[10:40:44] <MaxSan> ok that might be better :P
[10:41:39] <Cork> drager: set disabled = true/false on the stylesheets through js
[10:41:59] <Cork> drager: or the user can pick through the browser ui
[10:42:20] <Cork> (though that said, the ui is quite hidden in most browsers)
[10:44:07] <AlexxL_> /
[10:45:27] <Cork> drager: here: $('link').each(function()) { $(this).prop('disabled', true); }); $('link[title="target"]').prop('disabled', false);
[10:46:14] <Cork> alternatively if you have css files that should always be used to $('link[title]').each...
[10:46:22] <Cork> to==do
[10:47:17] <drager> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/WA2as/1/
[10:48:00] <shoky> no reason for the .each
[10:50:08] <Cork> shoky: ah, right i always forget that setting props works on multiple elements
[10:50:23] <almaidinajad> hii everybody I need some help
[10:51:04] <almaidinajad> I don't understand how can show a div when i click on another, suggestions?
[10:51:38] <BillCriswell> almaidinajad: $('.one').on('click', function(){ $('.two').show(); });
[10:51:39] <NoiseEee> almaidinajad: $('#something').on('click',function() { $('#otherThing').show(); })
[10:51:47] <Cork> drager: http://jsfiddle.net/WA2as/2/

[10:52:12] <Cork> ...
[10:52:21] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: i'm retiring
[10:52:25] <BillCriswell> =)
[10:54:08] <almaidinajad> thanks BillCriswell and NoiseEee
[10:54:52] <Cork> almaidinajad: the selection can also be based on the relation to the current element
[10:55:08] <benth> i'm using Draggable and Resizable in jQuery UI. Draggable has a nice "stack" option to bring the dragged object to the front
[10:55:08] <Cork> like sibling, closest and similar
[10:55:28] <benth> I was wondering what might be involved in getting this same behavior for Resizable. any thoughts?
[11:00:04] <almaidinajad> here is an example of the code I want to manipulate
[11:00:07] <almaidinajad> http://jsfiddle.net/E6j9L/
[11:00:58] <almaidinajad> when I click button1 only d1 has to show, when click button2 show d2, and so on
[11:01:10] <almaidinajad> any suggestion
[11:01:12] <almaidinajad> ?
[11:01:22] <sacho> what's stopping you?
[11:01:59] <Cork> almaidinajad: you could wither base it on id's
[11:02:05] <Cork> almaidinajad: or the dom index
[11:02:59] <almaidinajad> I don't get how can show/hidden something from a div to another
[11:03:11] <Cork> $('#box').on('click', 'div', function() { $('#description div').hide().eq($(this).index()).show();  })
[11:03:36] <BillCriswell> Cork: Was typing up that same code.
[11:03:38] <drager> Cork: Cool, thanks
[11:03:38] <BillCriswell> CODE JYNX
[11:05:07] <Cork> almaidinajad: note though show/hide doesn't work with visibility
[11:07:00] <almaidinajad> Cork, with display?
[11:07:19] <Cork> almaidinajad: one sec let me fix the pb
[11:07:41] <almaidinajad> o, Cork

[11:25:37] <tangorri> yes
[11:26:12] <Cork> and?
[11:26:26] <happyface> If I have inline scripts jQuery mobile doesnt load the page on iPhone (stuck at loaing div). What can I do about this? I tried  $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false with no results
[11:26:34] <tangorri> js console : JQuery is not defined
[11:27:08] <tangorri> even doing https://github.com/kartonnade/jparallax/commit/ff26cdad3dd3cf37cc158ecb254f623e0ce47f10
[11:27:08] <b-ot> tangorri: kartonnade (4d 10h ago): Replace "handle" with "dispatch"  Replace "handle" with "dispatch" at line 101 for compatibility with jQuery 1.9
[11:27:08] <Cork> tangorri: you've tried to load it before jquery was loaded then
[11:27:27] <tangorri> nope
[11:27:43] <tangorri> it's inside a jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[11:27:49] <Cork> tangorri: you have to
[11:28:02] <Cork> else jQuery would be defined
[11:29:28] <tangorri> O_o
[11:39:05] <sacho> tangorri, the script including that line(jQuery(document)...) is loaded before jquery
[11:40:25] <fliggerty> hey all....I've got a problem with jqueryui button()/buttonset() that I've never come across before; wonder if I can get a bit of assistance perhaps please
[11:41:18] <shoky> fliggerty: give it a shot
[11:41:34] <fliggerty> fantastic...thanks :)
[11:42:13] <fliggerty> I'm using it on some checkboxes, the method call works fine if I load them via static HTML
[11:42:49] <fliggerty> several checkboxes wrapped in a div, id is req_buttons; $("#req_buttons").buttonset();
[11:43:06] <shoky> fliggerty: best to provide a jsfiddle testcase
[11:43:20] <fliggerty> but when I use $.post() to pull the html into the page, the same call fails
[11:43:52] <shoky> testcase or at least pastebin of the relevant code
[11:44:24] <fliggerty> Okay, I've not used jsfiddle before...but I'm happy to do so.  Please allow me a few minutes to familiarize myself with it
[11:46:14] * sacho prefers jsbin
[11:51:11] <fliggerty> Okay, this is the basic code, the bit that works okay: http://jsfiddle.net/t8YV3/
[11:51:14] <dnyy> this isn't much of a jquery question, i guess. but if you were using something like bootstrap to create a "Message" modal that opens when you click a user's name from a list. would you create a modal per user and open the specific modal, or one modal and have the data within it (user ID in form, etc) change based on what's clicked?
[11:51:25] <fliggerty> I'm still trying to sort out how to emulate ajax calls in jsfiddle
[11:51:42] <tangorri> sacho, so code can be executed before jQ is loaede even if it's inside a jQuery(document).ready handler ? :S
[11:51:54] <dougb> Is there a way for jQuery to listen for events on multiple elemenets? I thought I'd be able to do $('#ele1, #ele2, #ele3').on('change', function() {}); but that doesn't seem to work
[11:52:07] <sacho> tangorri, the code "jQuery(...)" requires jQuery to be defined.
[11:52:14] <shoky> fliggerty: you don't really need to emulate an ajax call.. you can just put the html in some var, and call a setTimeout
[11:52:23] <tangorri> sacho : that's why I don't get it
[11:52:30] <sacho> Don't get what?
[11:52:41] <shoky> fliggerty: or if you want you can:  $.post('/echo/html/', {html: 'THE_HTML_STRING'}, function(html) { ... });
[11:52:52] <sacho> You need to defined jQuery before executing that code. Load the jquery script first, then yours.
[11:52:54] <tangorri> I got error jQuery not define
[11:52:59] <sacho> you need to define*
[11:53:19] <tangorri> I know I know
[11:53:25] <fliggerty> ah, ok...thanks.  let's see if I can get it to throw the same error here with that
[11:53:27] <tangorri> that's what I'm doing
[11:53:53] <tangorri> https://gist.github.com/tangorri/5446349
[11:54:17] <Thorn> hello
[11:54:20] <Thorn> is there a simple template plugin to replace $('<foo class="' + foo_class + '">' + foo_content + '</foo>') ?
[11:54:30] <shoky> tangorri: you need to include jquery in the html page, before that <script> you pasted
[11:54:43] <}Bloomberg> Someone could tell me if is possible to put some like this   :::   <input type="javascript_var" value="Something"/>
[11:55:00] <}Bloomberg> Inside the type to put some Js var!
[11:55:48] <Cork> }Bloomberg: <input type="hidden" id="jsvar" value="Something">
[11:56:00] <Cork> $('#jsvar').val()
[11:56:22] <sacho> }Bloomberg, are you trying to modify the type of the input based on some data you are processing in your script?
[11:56:44] <tangorri> ok sacho shoky : the full code https://gist.github.com/tangorri/5446349
[11:56:59] <}Bloomberg> Really I'm doing a dynamic type
[11:57:06] <}Bloomberg> So I define the var before with jquery
[11:57:24] <fliggerty> I updated the jsfiddle to create the html dynamically via the post, just as it is on my page, then it calls .buttonset()  http://jsfiddle.net/t8YV3/1/
[11:57:27] <fliggerty> it's working fine here
[11:57:42] <Cork> }Bloomberg: $('<input/>').attr({ type: variable, value; 'Something }); ?
[11:57:57] <Cork> opps value: not value;
[11:58:21] <shoky> fliggerty: maybe you have more than one element with the same id?
[11:58:27] <tangorri> anyone using jparallax here please ?
[11:58:29] <fliggerty> on my page though I'm getting a TypeError: Object function, which ends with "has no method 'extend'
[11:58:39] <shoky> tangorri:  what line are you getting the error on?
[11:58:53] <tangorri> on 133
[11:59:02] <tangorri> the problem is the .parallax call
[11:59:03] <fliggerty> I thought that might be the case, but there is only the one with that ID
[11:59:06] <shoky> tangorri: you have JQuery instead of jQuery
[11:59:09] <shoky> on that line.
[11:59:42] <tangorri> -_-
[11:59:47] <tangorri> damn !!!
[11:59:53] <tangorri> thanks shoky
[11:59:58] <shoky> ;p
[12:00:03] <tangorri> :'(
[12:00:06] <tangorri> :]
[12:00:14] <tangorri> that old story again ...
[12:00:21] <tangorri> shoky: ++
[12:00:25] <fliggerty> I get the exact same error if I call just button() on one of the individual checkbox elements inside the div
[12:00:32] <tangorri> shoky++
[12:01:06] <shiftins> jquery ui used to have a 'select' method passed to .tabs()
[12:01:27] <shiftins> was that changd to {activate:int} ?
[12:03:46] <shoky> shiftins: activate event, yeah. i think
[12:08:46] <shoky> fliggerty: can you pastebin the full error message and say which line is causing the error
[12:12:00] <fliggerty> http://pastebin.com/WwsqvsSf
[12:12:09] <fliggerty> that's the full error text; I'm not getting a line number
[12:12:48] <fliggerty> however, I just removed all other HTML from the ajax return besides the checkboxes and it worked....so there's something else causing the conflict in there
[12:13:18] <fliggerty> unfortunately it's quite a bit of content that is returned :(
[12:15:38] <fliggerty> so I guess it's a matter of a binary search until I pinpoint the cause here
[12:16:06] <fliggerty> I certainly appreciate the help you have given though....it's nice to know how to use jsfiddle now :)
[12:20:58] <BillCriswell> A slow server really, really messes with my productivity.
[12:23:03] <tsheva> anyone tried jquery 2.0 yet ? anything good ?
[12:24:07] <snover> no, nobody has done that
[12:24:23] <Sna4x8> Is it possible to use a custom drag function with jQueryUI draggable?  (my attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/qbPed/)  I have an SVG with a pan() function that works well VTM style.  I'd like to be able to wire up a drag function on the svg, and call my pan function, but I can't seem to make it work with jQueryUI draggable().
[12:25:03] <Sna4x8> I'm returning false in the startDrag function because I don't want jQuery UI to actually drag my svg - I want to call my custom pan.  If I return false, though, drag() never fires.
[12:28:34] <sacho_> return it in drag
[12:28:56] <Sna4x8> sacho_: I tried that too, but when I do that dragstop fires right after.
[12:30:29] <rien> hey folks, my can? is being TOTALLY ignored and always returning "true"
[12:30:44] <Sna4x8> Basically I want the drag event data without jQueryUI dragging my element.  I can do that custom I'm sure, but I figured I'd use jQueryUI if it was already done.
[12:33:03] <madprops> anybody knows if there's something to make tiled windows that can be resized?
[12:35:33] <Cork> madprops: jquery dialog ?
[12:41:45] <sacho_> rien, your can?
[12:42:08] <compex> does anyone know how to properly use javascript from inside a twitter bootstrap modal?
[12:42:40] <rien> sacho_: yes, cancan
[12:42:51] <rien> in a haml file I say: - if can?(:manage_policy, @product)
[12:42:57] <rien> that returns true all the time
[12:44:15] <chronossc> hello. nice question to guys.

[12:48:09] <JesperA> hmm
[12:57:32] <drager> Cork: You here?
[12:57:44] <Cork> sure
[12:57:56] <drager> The script isnt working as I thought
[12:58:02] <drager> (or at all)
[12:58:22] <Cork> what isn't working?
[12:58:28] <drager> http://jsfiddle.net/WA2as/3/
[12:58:36] <drager> It doesnt change css file
[13:03:16] <drager> Cork: I need be able to switch between those two
[13:03:56] <amph1bius> anyone know why this isn't working: http://jsbin.com/obuyah/1/
[13:06:15] <lx4r> Hello everybody
[13:06:45] <shoky> drager: http://jsbin.com/amomuc/1/edit
[13:08:19] <lx4r> I'm trying to resize an object inside a div proportional to the div with jQuery UI but it's somehow not working. My site: http://twitch.l3r.de/ (use "ignproleague" for testing by creating a new stream). Can anybody help me?
[13:08:45] <Cork> shoky: ah, nice didn't know that jsbin was nice about css
[13:08:56] <Cork> had a hard time finding anyplace to host the css files :)
[13:09:12] <drager> shoky: cool, thanks
[13:10:51] <Cork> ugg, just noticed that the enable code was outside the click handler in the original code >_<
[13:11:06] <chronos> well, so I'm here... about that question about delay listener2 from being executed I not found a way, mainly beacause when I dont have control on it. When I define listener1 (and set it using a preBind function) listener2 was already defined. With that scenario, issue is that even with me having my method on at 1st place on paste listeners, there is a visible delay between they code be executed and paste happens. How trace/solve that?
[13:13:21] <shoky> yah jsbin is great for hosting raw shit
[13:13:34] <rien> can someone help me understand cancan?
[13:13:50] <Cork> shoky: sadly it's shitty in other areas though
[13:13:53] <rien> why does the wiki go on and on about the "can" method? I only ever use "can?"
[13:14:06] <Cork> mainly cause it doesn't work without localstorage
[13:14:19] <shoky> oh
[13:15:09] <Cork> shoky: or rather it takes for granted that there will be local storage, so it crashes if it's not there
[13:15:34] <Cork> shoky: but it doesn't need it, cause if you just fake it with a js object jsbin is happy
[13:16:08] <shoky> heh
[13:16:43] <Cork> shoky: even wrote an extension for it :)
[13:16:44] <remysharp> Cork: jsbin shouldn't bomb if localStorage isn't there - which browser are you seeing that? (only because it should also work in IE6, etc)
[13:16:44] <Cork> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/shim-storage/
[13:16:54] <shoky> is the problem when using oldIE? or is localStorage sometimes disabled or what. i don't know shit about it
[13:17:02] <Cork> remysharp: firefox, chrome opera
[13:17:25] <Cork> shoky: for firefox its about:config?filter=dom.storage
[13:17:30] <remysharp> Cork: how is localStorage not available - have you disabled it?
[13:17:34] <Cork> yes
[13:17:36] <shoky> ah
[13:17:49] <Cork> then i feed them that extension if they crash
[13:17:55] <Cork> nice for trackability :)
[13:18:10] <Cork> each page load gets a new clean store :D
[13:18:53] <Cork> my biggest problem with localStorage is that it stores things without asking for permissions
[13:20:07] <GabrielFiel> use sencha
[13:20:38] <Cork> uh?
[13:20:50] <Cork> what does extjs have to do with this?
[13:28:01] <clarkk> could someone look at line 16 for me please? http://jsfiddle.net/r4dBQ/5/  Where am I going wrong here?
[13:30:08] <shoky> clarkk:  .find only looks for descendants of the element(s) you run it on
[13:30:29] <shoky> clarkk: you can use .filter() instead in your example
[13:30:32] <clarkk> shoky: ah
[13:30:41] <clarkk> aha, ok, thank you!!!
[13:30:42] <BillCriswell> clarkk: You're using .find
[13:30:43] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/r4dBQ/6/
[13:30:49] <BillCriswell> Oh, damn.
[13:31:06] * shoky hi5 BillCriswell
[13:31:12] <BillCriswell> yeahhhhh
[13:31:23] <shoky> awwwww shucksss
[13:31:27] <BillCriswell> hi5s are nice.
[13:31:44] <rien> I need help with cancan
[13:32:00] <rien> how do I define a custom action?
[13:32:06] <intergalactic> down low
[13:33:19] <shoky> wtf is cancan
[13:35:15] <rien> the authorizatin gem
[13:35:18] * clarkk dances the cancan with rien
[13:35:50] <clarkk> thanks for the filter method BillCriswell
[13:36:27] <shoky> rien: welp, this is #jquery
[13:36:37] <rien> oh I thought I was in ror
[13:36:38] <rien> fuck, sorry
[13:36:41] <shoky> ;]
[13:36:48] <SexyTattoos96> hi
[13:37:44] <BillCriswell> clarkk: No problem!
[13:38:03] <clarkk> so what is the reasoning behind the jquery objects being updated when attributes of elements are changed but not when elements are added/removed?  http://jsfiddle.net/r4dBQ/7/  The output at "log 4" could say the collection has a length of 3 but it states that its length is 4
[13:38:39] <clarkk> so you have to perform another select statement (query?) to get a correct reflection of the dom in your variable
[13:39:52] <remysharp> Cork: how do you disable localStorage in chrome?
[13:40:29] <drager> shoky: Btw, that code disables all the other css files
[13:40:33] <shoky> clarkk: remove() removes from the DOM, not from any variable you've stored
[13:40:37] <drager> (I have more than 2)
[13:40:40] <drager> For other styles
[13:40:55] <shoky> drager:  right.. then use what Cork said with $('link[title]') for example..
[13:41:22] <clarkk> shoky: I may have missed this in the docs, but then I don't know what I am looking for. Do you have a link to the information, please?
[13:41:46] <drager> shoky: Alright
[13:42:03] <shoky> clarkk: http://api.jquery.com/remove/   "from the DOM"
[13:43:29] <gnarf> clarkk: the query is executed, it's result is store, it is not a live list of nodes that match, query -> answer
[13:43:41] <Wamer> hello, how do i drop shadow on text field?
[13:43:48] <Wamer> not text shadow
[13:43:54] <gnarf> box shadow?
[13:43:55] <Wamer> box shadow
[13:44:01] <Wamer> yeah
[13:44:06] <gnarf> box-shadow ?
[13:44:16] <gnarf> `g css box-shadow
[13:44:16] <Wamer> ?
[13:44:17] <b-ot> gnarf: Box-shadow, one of CSS3′s best new features - CSS3 . Info → http://www.css3.info/preview/box-shadow/
[13:44:33] <Wamer> omg i am again in wrong channel
[13:44:34] <clarkk> shoky: I was really asking for the distinction in the docs made between the two. For example, attr() has "To retrieve and change DOM properties"
[13:44:38] <Wamer> iam talking about ios :D
[13:44:40] <gnarf> careful, its expensive rendering
[13:46:03] <clarkk> gnarf: but exactly the same "list"/store (variable) is used for changing attributes, and then update automatically
[13:46:34] <gnarf> clarkk: nodes are still nodes.. if you modify the node, it changes
[13:46:48] <gnarf> if you remove one from the dom, it still is a node, and can still be stored
[13:46:56] <gnarf> it doesn't "delete" the node, it just detaches is
[13:47:27] <clarkk> so what is the overriding rule?  That DOM restructuring is not live, but anything that does not cause a restructure happens in the store?
[13:47:39] <gnarf> there isn't a rule
[13:47:47] <gnarf> a DOMElement is a DOMElement...
[13:48:04] <gnarf> you can move it around in the dom all you want, it's `parentNode` property changes, etc
[13:48:18] <gnarf> if you change something about the node, it changes
[13:48:43] <gnarf> .remove() is basically going to set `parentNode` to null, and remove the jQuery data cache for the node
[13:48:53] <gnarf> if you still have a reference to the node, it will reflect this change
[13:49:15] <Cork> remysharp: http://webdevwonders.com/clear-dom-storage/
[13:56:19] <clarkk> gnarf: that's what I mean, the reference doesn't reflect it. See "log 4" (line 18) of  http://jsfiddle.net/r4dBQ/10/
[13:56:52] <gnarf> clarkk: the reference still reflects the change
[13:57:11] <gnarf> clarkk: the problem is, the selection isn't re-run, so you still have the same 4 elements you used to have
[13:57:21] <clarkk> gnarf: you mean one of the elements of the array is empty, but the length is still the same?
[13:58:12] <gnarf> clarkk: http://jsfiddle.net/r4dBQ/11/
[13:58:21] <clarkk> gnarf: yeah that is the bit I am trying to understand. What situations and why is a new selection necessary to get the correct reflection of the actual dom?
[13:58:22] <gnarf> clarkk: one of the elements in the old selection no longer has a parentNode
[13:58:42] <gnarf> clarkk: whenever the elements might of changed
[13:59:01] <clarkk> ok so when the objects change, but not their properties?
[13:59:35] <gnarf> if the result of a query might of changed, you probably want to re-select
[14:00:04] <gnarf> adding/removing dom elements won't change past query results
[14:01:28] <clarkk> heh, I'm really sorry gnarf, but that's the bit I don't understand. From what we have discussed, it "seems" to me like the opposite of that statement is true
[14:01:43] <gnarf> clarkk: ?
[14:02:05] <gnarf> anyone else have another translation of that statement to try?
[14:05:54] <gnarf> clarkk: http://jsbin.com/ekacen/1/edit
[14:07:33] <screamingbanshee> if you have assigned a collection to a token, and are operating on the token, adding DOM elements AFTER you create your collection won't dynamically add them to the token too
[14:12:48] <tsheva> anyone can give me opinion about this jquery plugin ? jresponsive.is-great.net
[14:15:06] <clarkk> ok I think I get it now. Thank you so much for your patience
[14:15:36] <g44> when i try to refresh a sortable i get: Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on sortable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[14:15:57] <g44> but im totally n--b on jquery
[14:16:23] <tsheva> ?
[14:19:31] <g44> how can it be prior to initialization when the page is running already
[14:19:32] <g44> ?
[14:20:00] <tsheva> what problem are you talking about g44?
[14:20:29] <g44> [22:15] <g44> when i try to refresh a sortable i get: Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on sortable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[14:20:37] <remysharp> Cork:
[14:20:50] <remysharp> Cork: do you typically have cookies turned off too (along with localStorage)?
[14:23:08] <tsheva> @g44 is it about the jquery plugin that i asked ?
[14:23:09] <b-ot> tsheva: memorised “g44”.
[14:23:18] <Cork> remysharp: thirdpary and permanent
[14:23:43] <remysharp> Cork: only because jsbin can't actually save with cookies turned off, they're used for the csrf checks
[14:23:49] <Cork> remysharp: session i clear from time to time (fiddling with a solution that removes them when a tab is closed)
[14:24:04] <Cork> remysharp: ya, but session cookies is enough
[14:24:05] <remysharp> Cork: the rest works, and I've fixed the sessionStorage bug which I was going to land once I checked this point
[14:24:27] <Cork> remysharp: uh, you develop jsbin?
[14:24:32] <remysharp> Cork: yep.
[14:24:34] <Cork> wow
[14:25:01] <remysharp> Cork: I prefer bugs being filed on github, but I happened to be floating in here so I went about fixing storage
[14:25:26] <Cork> remysharp: it dind't even cross my mind to look for a bug tracker
[14:25:29] <remysharp> Cork: it was working some time ago, but I made a small change in the last 12 months that causes sessionStorage to bork - only because jsbin I know *used* to work in IE6.
[14:25:51] <BillCriswell> You're a brave man for making it work in IE6.
[14:25:58] <Cork> ya :D
[14:26:06] <edoop> i want to make a slide controlled
[14:26:09] <edoop> by drag .
[14:26:23] <edoop> between  a range min , max. and left , right
[14:26:30] <edoop> what do you suggest?
[14:26:32] <mmiller_> I'm trying to use jquery.simulate to write unit tests for my code. For one of my tests, I need to simulate a key press. If I specify { keyCode: 45 } it works fine in Chrome, but breaks FF. If I instead use { charCode: 45 } it works fine in FF but breaks Chrome. Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening?
[14:27:11] <remysharp> BillCriswell: it's not for me, it's for the poor soul that has to work in IE6 (or IE7) and has a bug they can't fix - jsbin supports their browser to replicate and fix.
[14:27:42] <remysharp> BillCriswell: but yeah, it's not the easiest - but mostly dropping back down to a simple textarea
[14:28:34] <BillCriswell> edoop: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6360249/jquery-ui-sliders-on-touch-devices this answer looks good.
[14:28:42] <BillCriswell> remysharp: Good reasoning. =)
[14:29:33] <edoop> BillCriswell i ask you if this is available on ie and firefox
[14:29:54] <didiergm> On JQ Mobile. TextArea auto adjusts it's height when user input data. How can I force the same behaviour when I populate a textartea from js ?
[14:31:15] <aghouseh> anyone have thoughts on troubleshooting the .animate() method moving the element, but not actually animating it?
[14:32:06] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: what do you have the duration set at?
[14:32:21] <aghouseh> was 500, but currently commented out so its just default
[14:32:56] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: So you're saying it's just going from start to finish immediately?
[14:33:04] <aghouseh> yes
[14:33:07] <aghouseh> no transition  :/
[14:34:55] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: Have some code to look at? Hard to tell without looking at it.
[14:35:17] <aghouseh> yea
[14:35:41] <aghouseh> http://pastebin.com/WiLgQgYY
[14:36:31] <aghouseh> if i try to animate the element manually via firebug, it works fine.
[14:40:46] <madprops> I'm trying to set a click event on a div with a certain class but it's not working. is it because it has multiple classes?
[14:40:57] <BillCriswell> madprops: That wouldn't matter.
[14:41:04] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: This is weird.
[14:41:10] <aghouseh> could be
[14:41:12] <aghouseh> :p
[14:42:15] <acidjazz> madprops: its because you drink too much
[14:42:39] <madprops> rofl
[14:43:13] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: What if you put something like 10000 in there?
[14:43:34] <aghouseh> k ill give it a whirl
[14:43:53] <aghouseh> what type of things would prevent it from animating tho? im already checking .is(':animated'); and calling .stop()
[14:44:10] <BillCriswell> Yeah I don't see what it woudl be.
[14:44:19] <aghouseh> welp, 10000 makes it move :p
[14:44:41] <BillCriswell> So it worked?
[14:44:45] <aghouseh> which makes no sense.. hah yeah
[14:44:49] <BillCriswell> Hmm
[14:45:05] <BillCriswell> What is new_offset returning?
[14:45:12] <aghouseh> that value is right
[14:45:30] <aghouseh> its always a factor of 720 (my pane size)
[14:45:58] <BillCriswell> So what's speed?
[14:45:59] <aghouseh> im logging those both before firing the animation to be sure that im sending the right values
[14:46:02] <aghouseh> 500
[14:46:03] <BillCriswell> Is it coming through as 500?
[14:46:05] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[14:46:06] <aghouseh> yup
[14:46:07] <aghouseh> hah
[14:46:44] <aghouseh> hm it sort of "jerks" to start the animation tho..
[14:46:59] <aghouseh> that might be insight as to what the heck is happening
[14:48:06] <aghouseh> wish i could give a url, but im VPN'd in and there are NDAs and all kinds of crap, so :/
[14:48:20] <BillCriswell> aghouseh: I understand. damn the man.
[14:48:24] <aghouseh> yup yup
[14:48:31] <BillCriswell> I have a run anyway. Good luck. Sure you'll get it.
[14:48:45] <aghouseh> ok thanks for taking a look.. i appreciate it
[14:48:49] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[15:07:26] <dokma> is there a way to test if jquery can connect to a domain via ajax?
[15:07:45] <dokma> I've setup a fake domain in /etc/hosts and now I'm not sure if the browser is picking that up...
[15:10:55] <V8Energy> why it won't let me change the width of a table cell? it says width of object HTMLTableCellElement is not a function.. $("#new_transaction_table tr:first td")[0].width()
[15:11:56] <shoky> V8Energy:  doing [0] gets the native DOM element object. maybe you want .eq(0) or .first()  or td:first
[15:12:06] <V8Energy> oh
[15:12:09] <V8Energy> thank you sir
[15:12:31] <V8Energy> $("#new_transaction_table tr:first td") gave me an array, so i used []
[15:12:36] <V8Energy> to get the first one
[15:12:39] <shoky> it's always an array
[15:12:56] <shoky> jquery objects are array-like
[15:13:13] <shoky> the array items are not jquery objects though
[15:14:47] <Foxhoundz> shoky: didn't it always return jQuery objects?
[15:15:25] <shoky> Foxhoundz: didn't what? $(..) always returns jquery objects, yeah..
[15:15:47] <shoky> by "it's always an array" i meant "it's always a jquery object, which is array-like"
[15:23:31] <clh_> anyone associated with the jquery mobile project around?  there is a broken important link on the api documentation page
[15:23:57] <clh_> the very top link to the widget factory on this page is 404'ing : http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/widgets/
[15:24:12] <screamingbanshee> @gnarf
[15:24:31] <screamingbanshee> save us, Obi Gnarf
[15:27:30] <clov3r> hey if jquery doesn't match a selector
[15:27:39] <clov3r> does it still return an object?
[15:27:47] <shoky> yes
[15:27:52] <clov3r> and hence not == false
[15:27:52] <shoky> with .length === 0
[15:27:58] <clov3r> ah
[15:27:59] <clov3r> ok
[15:28:39] <clov3r> thanks :)
[15:29:48] <tharkun> I found a bunch of widgets (lacking a better name) that are part of jqueryui I also need some plugins of jquery do I have to download both or jqueryui is a superset of jquery? (Please bare my newishness regarding javascript)
[15:31:18] <dokma> how do I verify I have a 'same origin policy' problem?
[15:31:20] <shoky> tharkun: jquery-ui depends on jquery
[15:31:53] <dokma> I am trying to do $.ajax to a php script on the same server from which the html page is loaded
[15:32:26] <Theowning> That should be a same origin issue then
[15:32:38] <dokma> and I end up with OPTIONS instead of POST request
[15:33:13] <Theowning> Firefox and chrome both give sort of confusing responses
[15:33:33] <Theowning> but if you can test in safari believe it or not, it should give you the exact error it's having
[15:33:45] <shoky> dokma: is the domain the same? (not asking if its the same physical machine)
[15:34:05] <dokma> shoky: the thing is that the domain is faked via /etc/hosts
[15:34:11] <dokma> it's not a real domain
[15:34:19] <shoky> and yeah, you'd get some error in your console in chrome and FF
[15:34:21] <tharkun> shoky: Ok so I'll download both. Thanks
[15:34:36] <dokma> ahhh... let me check that
[15:35:18] <shoky> dokma: the question is if the domain you're loading the original page from is the same as the one in the url you supply to $.ajax
[15:36:00] <shoky> so if you're faking the 2nd one (so it's a different domain), i think it'd be a SOP issue. even though they're both pointing at the same server
[15:36:02] <dokma> shoky: this is in the $.ajax:     url        : 'index.php',
[15:36:10] <shoky> oh
[15:37:00] <shoky> well that should work fine i guess.
[15:45:33] <dokma> shoky: it was www non-www issue
[15:46:03] <dokma> I changed the domain from a dashed one to no dash and forgot to update the rewrite

[16:12:03] <clh_> should jquery-mobile related questions be asked here?
[16:15:17] <anew> yes
[16:22:08] <clh_> jquery-mobile question : anyone ever tried enhancing a listview to act as an accordion?  I'd like to have the search capability of the list view, but also have the expansion/collapse of an accordion
[16:32:04] <mpc2500> Paste here: http://jsfiddle.net/Vvtzn/ I'm trying to make a form that allows the user the add multiple "units". I'm using clone to duplicate the fields. Every clone will be based off the first's values. See fiddle for code + form.
[16:33:19] <mpc2500> I thought by moving var whatToClone = $(".rider-info-pane"); outside of the function and storing it that would be a baseline empty set as per the what the document looked like at domready
[16:37:02] <eddiemonge> mpc2500: you need a template.
[16:37:18] <rupee>  
[16:37:41] <mpc2500> eddiemonge: I ass/u/me/d that I was making a "ghetto one when I assigned  whatToClone
[16:37:52] <shoky> mpc2500: you can try  var whatToClone = $(".rider-info-pane").clone();
[16:37:57] <eddiemonge> mpc2500: nope. that just stores a reference
[16:38:55] <mpc2500> shoky: that worked! <3
[16:39:45] <mpc2500> eddiemonge: just to make sure I'm not going insane, that stores a ref because it returns the jquery object OR because thats how all js assignment is?
[16:40:02] <eddiemonge> yes
[16:40:21] <mpc2500> eddiemonge: should I have made that an XOR? :P
[16:43:53] <shoky> mpc2500: $('selector') returns a collection of references to the actual elements in the DOM
[16:46:38] <mpc2500> shoky: your best suggestion on how to attach events to the thangs in that were cloned? clone(true) and clone(true,true) aren't copying events... (which is strange)
[16:46:52] <shoky> event delegation
[16:47:34] <shoky> read about it in http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:49:16] <shoky> (with that you wont need to care about event handlers attached to the cloned elements)
[16:49:56] <mpc2500> shoky: I'm using $(".crus-center input").change(function () { // more stuff ofc | but that only works for the first one that was present inside of the dom-ready. On the cloned ones it is never fired
[16:50:35] <mpc2500> the change() docs says its a wrapper around on('change') so I assume that it has the same functionality, just shorthand?
[16:50:52] <dokma> I'm storing the result of $.ajax call in order to kill the long poll connection if the user tries to browse away
[16:50:57] <dokma> works in Chrome just fine
[16:51:03] <shoky> mpc2500 you need to call .clone(true,true) on the DOM elements after setting the event handlers
[16:51:08] <dokma> but in FF the result of $.ajax call is null
[16:51:16] <dokma> is that intended or some kind of a bug?
[16:51:31] <shay__> hi, would somone know how to access the scrollbar in jquery? I'm trying to make .animate(scrollTop) stop when the user clicks the scrollbar....
[16:52:04] <mpc2500> shay__: I'm not sure that's exposed
[16:52:08] <shoky> mpc2500: but with event delgation you'd do:  $('#rider-info').on('change', '.crus-center input', function() { ... })   once at the start,
[16:52:16] <shoky> mpc2500: and then you can just .clone()
[16:52:27] <shoky> doesnt matter if its before or after setting the handlers
[16:52:43] <shoky> and it's less wasteful
[16:56:27] <mpc2500> shoky: so you are saying that in this case the change() shorthand has different behavior then just using on('change',etc)?
[16:56:44] <shoky> mpc2500: .change(fn) is the same as .on('change', fn)
[16:57:03] <shoky> mpc2500: but its not the same as .on('change', 'other_selector', fn)   <-- that's event delegation, which it looks like you haven't read about yet
[16:57:42] <dokma> shoky: you got any idea why $.ajax would return null instead of a jqXHR ???
[16:57:52] <dokma> only happens in FF
[16:58:09] <shoky> dokma: from your description.. sounds like it's because the user browsed away..?
[16:58:22] <dokma> no you got me wrong
[16:58:35] <dokma> I make an $.ajax request storing the response in the following way
[16:58:44] <dokma> xhr = $.ajax ....
[16:59:07] <shoky> donno why $.ajax would return null
[16:59:14] <dokma> and if the user tries to browse away I want to abort the connection of the long poll by using the xhr
[16:59:18] <dokma> but in FF xhr is null
[16:59:33] <dokma> exactly... should be jqXHR object
[16:59:55] <shoky> is it the jqXHR object if you don't browse away?
[17:00:10] <dokma> no that is the point
[17:00:16] <shoky> yet that is my question
[17:00:39] <dokma> the browsing away part works nice in Chrome where before killing the conn on browse away an error popup would jump
[17:00:43] <shoky> sry, misread
[17:01:07] <dokma> so in FF immediately after calling xhr = $.ajax
[17:01:10] <dokma> xhr is null
[17:02:21] <shoky> xhr = $.ajax(...); console.log(xhr);   logs null?
[17:15:51] <mpc2500> shoky: I think I'm making progress. New problem. Events are firing but I'm loosing "context" . http://jsfiddle.net/vkW8E/ Any thoughts?
[17:18:38] <shoky> mpc2500: use .closest()  e.g.  var crus = $(this).closest('.crus-center');
[17:19:55] <shoky> mpc2500: and also switch the .parent() chain to one call to .closest('.someclass')
[17:21:32] <sam452> Hello, I'm struggling to grasp why the simple divs in my .row-fluid in twitter bootstrap dutifully shrink but don't roll down to the next row.
[17:21:44] <shoky> mpc2500:  but don't use .rider-info-pane as the selector in $(...).on('change',...  if that's what you're cloning
[17:21:46] <sam452> Apparently I'm not using the correct search terms in Google.
[17:22:29] <sam452> which is why I'm appearing dumb here asking.
[17:23:27] <mpc2500> sam452: that sounds like a css issue? (I'm not super familar with bootstrap though...)
[17:24:21] <mpc2500> shoky: changed from .rider-info-pane to #rider-info as you had. changed to $(this).closest (that worked) and now changing that parent abomination! Thanks for your help
[17:24:44] <sam452> I'm aware that it attempts to shrink but I'm unable to determine how it switches to roll down if that is the right term.
[17:25:31] <shoky> mpc2500 sounds good
[17:28:02] <mpc2500> shoky: \o/ woot! <3 <3 <3
[17:45:43] <YammYcoding> my json does have some NULL strings in empty field values. How you guys handle this?
[17:48:10] <YammYcoding> just with an if ?
[17:48:19] <YammYcoding> if foo == 'null' ..  ?
[17:49:05] <Nothing4You> why would you do "'null'", i thought it'd be "null"
[17:51:54] <YammYcoding> oh you're right. if foo == null worked :D thanks
[18:00:35] <gnarf> slight distinction YammYcoding: undefined == null as well
[18:02:00] <PREFIX> is there any tool that lets you take JSON and it creates a visible object model out of it?
[18:02:32] <YammYcoding> it's that json printed string 'null' in it, i thought it was literally 'null' :)
[18:02:33] <ali1234> what is a visible object model?
[18:02:37] <YammYcoding> gladly it's not
[18:03:13] <PREFIX> as in, show me how a class structure out if it would work, with the parameters, arrays etc.
[18:03:24] <ali1234> you mean like a pretty print?
[18:03:38] <PREFIX> more like something that would show me a mapped version of it
[18:04:10] <ali1234> mapped to what?
[18:04:13] <PREFIX> ...
[18:04:23] <PREFIX> Class -> JSON -> Class
[18:04:33] <PREFIX> just something visual to see how I would use it as an object
[18:04:52] <ali1234> one of us is confused
[18:05:04] <gnarf> jsonlint.com will format json with tabs
[18:05:07] <gnarf> to make it easier to read
[18:05:19] <gnarf> aka "pretty print"
[18:09:25] <Nothing4You> i have some code looking like this http://jsfiddle.net/VuH3U/ , getting the error "TypeError: Object #<HTMLImageElement> has no method 'parent'"
[18:09:39] <Nothing4You> anyone got an idea?
[18:12:53] <gnarf> Nothing4You: .eq(1) instead of [1]
[18:13:04] <gnarf> the actual items in the array are DOMElement, not jQuery
[18:13:18] <gnarf> .eq(#) will pull just one item out and leave it wrapped in jQuery
[18:13:42] <gnarf> you should prolly use .html() instead of prop('innerHTML') anyway
[18:14:24] <Nothing4You> ok, but i still result in undefined
[18:15:00] <Nothing4You> the $('img[src="/skin/imgProxy.php?i=general"]') returns something that doesn't have a 'parent()' method
[18:19:10] <gnarf> not if $===jQuery
[18:19:22] <gnarf> jQuery(anything).parent will be a method
[18:19:27] <gnarf> unless jQuery has been pillaged
[18:19:43] <gnarf> what browser are you using?
[18:19:46] <Nothing4You> chrome
[18:20:02] <gnarf> what is $ === jQuery ?
[18:20:39] <Nothing4You> true
[18:21:03] <Nothing4You> does http://jsfiddle.net/VuH3U/2/ not show "match 2 undefined" to you?
[18:21:55] <gnarf> so
[18:22:00] <gnarf> a) parent() only goes up by one
[18:22:02] <archfool> In jQuery Mobile 1.3.x, how do I get rid of ellipses and turn on wrap in the collapsible bar?
[18:22:08] <gnarf> `closest @Nothing4You
[18:22:12] <gnarf> this is prolly what you wanted
[18:22:19] <gnarf> `api closest @Nothing4You
[18:22:20] <b-ot> Nothing4You: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:22:33] <gnarf> also, arrays are zero indexed, so if you want the first, .eq(0), or just .first()
[18:22:39] <gnarf> `api first
[18:22:39] <b-ot> gnarf: .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/

[18:22:44] <b-ot> gnarf: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[18:22:55] <Nothing4You> i want the second one
[18:22:59] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/VuH3U/3/
[18:23:10] <gnarf> oh
[18:23:14] <gnarf> missed the second th in the html
[18:23:15] <gnarf> sry
[18:23:17] <gnarf> but yeah
[18:23:21] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/VuH3U/4/
[18:23:26] <gnarf> closest() :)
[18:23:50] <gnarf> parents(selector) would work too, can also catch more than one
[18:23:59] <gnarf> so you prolly want closest
[18:24:05] <Nothing4You> looks like it
[18:24:14] <Nothing4You> thanks, that seems to work
[18:29:37] <Nothing4You> how can i check if it finds nothing?
[18:30:12] <archfool> In jQuery Mobile 1.3.x, Collapsible Element: how do I get rid of ellipses and turn on wrap in the <h3>Really Long Text To Be Wrapped</h3>?
[18:30:36] <Nothing4You> in chrome inspector i see it returning [] but if i use $("xyz") == [] i get false returned
[18:30:47] <archfool> playing with .ui-btn-inner  yields many fierce dragons.  ;)
[18:31:18] <Aquaguy> Hello everybody
[18:31:42] <alainus> is there a shorter way to do $.find('[data-isotope-key]').attr('data-isotope-key'); ?
[18:31:52] <Nothing4You> oh, nvm. it's .length
[18:33:32] <Aquaguy> Hello, is there any way to add some "sensibility" to mouseover / mouseleave?
[18:33:35] <Aquaguy> titlebar.unbind('.rcms').bind('mouseenter.rcms mouseleave.rcms', function (e) { container.fadeToggle('fast'); });
[18:34:06] <Aquaguy> I'm using fadeToggle but if you move the mouse quicly in and out of the container the animation goes crazy ahaha
[18:34:38] <Aquaguy> I would like to animate it if the mouse has been in or out of the container at least for 1 second
[18:36:16] <gnarf> Aquaguy: old plugin named hoverIntent that does that
[18:36:17] <gnarf> also
[18:36:34] <gnarf> if you're using the .fadeToggle() you can .stop().fadeToggle() and it should reverse properly
[18:36:51] <gnarf> there are a few versions thats broken in, but it's unit tested in 1.9
[18:36:52] <gnarf> so
[18:37:01] <gnarf> YMMV
[18:37:57] <Aquaguy> ok, thank you

[19:31:02] <gnarf> b) return testObject, not null on line 15
[19:31:14] <gnarf> no reason to keep testObject in that outer scope
[19:31:40] <PREFIX> a) it is already declared with var globally
[19:31:48] <PREFIX> dude i only added that to test if my function worked
[19:32:15] <PREFIX> I want to be able to do var myobj = GetJSONObjectById( ID )
[19:32:19] <PREFIX> but that somehow sets myobj to null

[19:32:34] <PREFIX>                 return obj;
[19:32:38] <PREFIX> line 11
[19:32:39] <gnarf> that is in the each

[19:38:15] <bot-t> gnarf: true

[19:38:32] <gnarf> $.each will quit looping if you return false

[19:57:32] <Foxhoundz> aFeijo: I would suggest the nth-child() depending on the HTML structure of the page
[19:57:36] <Foxhoundz> or the links rather

[20:01:30] <aFeijo> myhrlin, its possible :) I'll try it
[20:02:32] <DrPoole> hello.
[20:03:52] <DrPoole> I'm creating a page (on the internet!) and i'm pulling in a fairly big json array which a bunch of other functions will need access to.  do i need to worry about performance of the browser handing an array of this size?  if i File->Save the output from Chrome to my desktop it's about 80k.
[20:04:07] <DrPoole> and it's 4800 lines of data.
[20:04:55] <DrPoole> ill do accessing it's array elements from various functions (array.foo[bar_id], etc)
[20:05:14] <beliveyourdream> how can i bind a key press to the form that is focused ??
[20:05:53] <DrPoole> add a selector on the form element?
[20:06:02] <beliveyourdream> i have a modal with two tabs and each tab has a form so when the user presses the enter key i want it to submit the form he is currently on
[20:06:12] <DrPoole> ah
[20:06:31] <DrPoole> bind the key, then find the closest() form perhaps.
[20:06:42] <DrPoole> then foo.submit() or whatever you're doing
[20:07:10] <beliveyourdream> closest() ? closest starting from where ??
[20:07:26] <Z3R0> the "enter" key should trigger the button
[20:07:58] <beliveyourdream> Z3R0: yes .. but how do i know which button ?
[20:08:02] <beliveyourdream> since there are 2 of them ?
[20:08:36] <DrPoole> the browser should just do that, i reckon.  if they're positioned on any of it's elements
[20:09:01] <DrPoole> shouldnt need jquery to handle that.  check your forms name id's and name's and all the html is proper (opening and closing tags, etc)
[20:09:46] <beliveyourdream> DrPoole: the form is ok dom wise .. but i don't have a submit input or a button of type submit
[20:10:00] <DrPoole> hm.
[20:10:06] <Z3R0> ah
[20:10:18] <Z3R0> so how are you triggering submit ? just the enter key ?
[20:10:46] <beliveyourdream> no .. it doesn't work .. that's why i want to do this .. i trigger in with on click for the button
[20:10:55] <beliveyourdream> *trigger it
[20:14:00] <DrPoole> wouldn't the focus be on one of the elements of the form?
[20:14:06] <DrPoole> since they just typed/did something
[20:14:18] <DrPoole> (back to using closest())
[20:14:33] <DrPoole> or maybe hide a submit button.  just thinking out loud :-)
[20:15:43] <someperson> hey folks, i have the server returning a json, and i'm doing xhr.responseText  to update the divs in ajax style, but the json includes user_id, how do i access that?
[20:17:54] <DrPoole> wut
[20:18:29] <DrPoole> success will have a function(variable) and then your data is in variable.user_id or whatever your tree looks like.  see .ajax or .getJSON etc.
[20:18:59] <kanja> Is there a way to turn off the options preflight for cors requests?
[20:21:01] <beliveyourdream> DrPoole: i can't really use the submit button because i'm doing ajax on the form submit so if i use a submit button and it's triggered by pressing enter i will get redirected and stuff
[20:29:53] <PAGO> hey is there any expert avaible i can pricatly explain my issue
[20:30:02] <PAGO> *privatly
[20:31:16] <PAGO> ?
[20:35:18] <PAGO> ok, so i will tell it to everyone. What I want is a click event. I've got a button and on blick it changes css propreties (in my case the visibilitie). but for for more than one item. because i want a specific item become visible and the should get hidden onclick
[20:35:27] <PAGO> anbody got a vlue?
[20:35:36] <PAGO> *clue
[20:36:59] <DrPoole> what is the problem?
[20:37:14] <DrPoole> make a trigger, then .show() the id's you want to change
[20:37:16] <DrPoole> or .css or whatever
[20:37:21] <DrPoole> seems pretty standard
[20:37:50] <PAGO> yes i triet some stuff but it didnt work out
[20:38:00] <DrPoole> "didn't work" is a broad statement
[20:38:07] <PAGO> can u give me an code example maybe?
[20:38:08] <DrPoole> put your code on a pastebin site
[20:39:04] <PAGO> well u will laugh^^ http://jsfiddle.net/BydwF/
[20:39:19] <PAGO> my js knowlege is really bad
[20:40:03] <garbagegod> PAGO: ever heard of classes?
[20:40:21] <DrPoole> yikes
[20:40:34] <PAGO> yes so js only works with classes?
[20:40:46] <DrPoole> PAGO: assign the elements a class and then use $('.classname').hide();
[20:40:57] <garbagegod> Not at all, but if you were to implement a class your code might not suck nearly as much
[20:41:07] <DrPoole> im off.  later
[20:41:13] <PAGO> :(
[20:42:30] <PAGO> so i can makes things hide and show in the js and dont have to try the css visibility?
[20:44:41] <garbagegod> PAGO: read this http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/
[20:45:12] <PAGO> -.- i know the difference of id's and classes
[20:46:42] <garbagegod> so use 2 classes instead of 15 freaking ID selectors
[20:49:05] <PAGO> so 2 classes for ech state. hidden and visible? i did all these id's because every id shows different stuff. well but i dont know nearly how i should write the code... guess i dont get that much help here if i dont know enough
[20:49:56] <garbagegod> PAGO: it can be tough getting help on IRC, I know
[20:50:55] <garbagegod> what I'm saying is, use one class for all the DOM elements you're hiding and one for the ones you're showing so you don't have 14 separate .css()'s
[20:52:27] <PAGO> but the ones which are hiding and showing change all the time someone clicks
[20:53:26] <PAGO> oh ok i get a picture of what u try telling me
[20:54:47] <PAGO> well i dont have a clue. but thanks for ur time
[20:55:39] <garbagegod> I don't even know what your problem is really
[20:56:28] <PAGO> my problem is, i dont know how to write the js stuff. hope i would get here an example i can work with
[20:56:33] <PAGO> *hoped
[20:57:06] <garbagegod> what are you trying to do with this alleged 'js stuff'
[21:00:06] <PAGO> if i click button 1, text 1 appears, text 2-12 disappears. if i click button 2, text 2 appears, text 1 and 3-12 disappears.    thats basicly what i try to write in js. every text got an id so got every button.
[21:01:10] <garbagegod> I see
[21:01:17] <garbagegod> What's your markup look like?
[21:02:46] <PAGO> what u mean by markup?
[21:02:55] <PAGO> my css and html stuff?
[21:03:46] <garbagegod> just HTML
[21:04:04] <garbagegod> PAGO, just curious, is English not your first language?
[21:04:15] <PAGO> nope :P
[21:05:13] <garbagegod> That's fine, just wondering, I'd only be upset with you if it was :)
[21:05:49] <PAGO> hehe, its pretty big so i dont know if it helps u or confuses you
[21:05:49] <PAGO> http://jsfiddle.net/eUTbn/
[21:08:03] <garbagegod> Give me one minute
[21:08:17] <PAGO> take ur time
[21:10:41] <kanja> Can I turn off the options preflight for a cors request? I'm using a cloud provider for an api and they don't currently allow options requests
[21:14:44] <sl33k> How di I check if field values have changed since page has loaded when the form button is submitted?
[21:15:21] <sl33k> do*
[21:16:36] <screamingbanshee> $(document).on("change", selector, function() { });
[21:18:24] <sl33k> How can selector for all values be identified?
[21:18:51] <Swapnesh> Which jQuery plugin this slider is using http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/wordpress/
[21:19:08] <Swapnesh> or any free available something like this
[21:19:42] <screamingbanshee> $(document).on("change", "#replace_with_your_selector", function() { });
[21:19:54] <Guddu> Is it possible to have 2 forms on the same HTML page? And submit each using a Ajax Submit?
[21:19:57] <screamingbanshee> yes
[21:22:55] <Swapnesh> Which jQuery plugin this slider is using http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/wordpress/
[21:23:01] <Swapnesh> or something similar to that
[21:23:12] <Swapnesh> but with tittles at the buttom
[21:24:23] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: Is it possible with serialize()
[21:24:36] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k yes
[21:25:30] <screamingbanshee> $("form#id").serialize()
[21:26:07] <screamingbanshee> @Swapnesh with what?
[21:26:58] <Swapnesh> @Screaminbanshee which jquery slider plugin this wordpress slider is using
[21:28:03] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: it returns an array of values. so the two arrays would be different if individual value changed?
[21:28:56] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k no - you've got 2 concepts happening there. the first example binds the change event to whatever selector you choose.
[21:29:17] <screamingbanshee> probably binding it to the serialized values is not what you wanted
[21:29:24] <Cork> sl33k: you're prob looking for serializeArray see ?.serializeArray
[21:29:25] <bot-t> sl33k, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[21:29:51] <Cork> serialize returns a params string
[21:30:14] <sl33k> I will look into it.
[21:30:24] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k what are you trying to do, exactly?
[21:31:46] <Swapnesh> any help :'(
[21:31:57] <Cork> Swapnesh: what's the question?
[21:32:08] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: I have a form to update user profile. If the user does not change any of its field while submitting, I would like to give him some useful message if so
[21:32:13] <Swapnesh> Which jQuery plugin this slider is using http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/wordpress/
[21:32:23] <Swapnesh> or soe another jquery plugin
[21:32:39] <Swapnesh> with similar UI
[21:32:42] <Swapnesh> some*
[21:32:52] <Cork> Swapnesh: sidenote its a slideshow not a slider
[21:33:03] <screamingbanshee> So you want to trigger an event if the user tries to submit a form without changing any values.
[21:33:28] <Cork> Swapnesh: and as the url says it uses royalslider
[21:33:30] <Swapnesh> @Cork thx..still any help :)
[21:33:40] <Cork> plugins/royal-slider/royalslider/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
[21:33:45] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: yes exactly and then .html() the message.
[21:33:47] <Cork> oppps wrong link
[21:33:54] <Cork> plugins/royal-slider/royalslider/jquery.royalslider.min.js?v=9.3.6
[21:34:11] <Swapnesh> yeah its a padi one..I am looking for a free one
[21:34:15] <Swapnesh> paid*
[21:34:32] <Cork> Swapnesh: you would have to look around there are hundreds of them out there
[21:34:56] <Swapnesh> any suggestion I am searching but no luck :(
[21:35:17] <Cork> ?g slideshow jquery
[21:35:17] <screamingbanshee> ok, the easiest way would be to make a collection of the serialized form values when it loads. then compare it to the serialized form values when the user tries to submit.
[21:35:18] <b-ot> Cork: SlidesJS, a responsive slideshow plug-in for jQuery (1.7.1+) with ... → http://www.slidesjs.com/
[21:35:19] <bot-t> Cork, SlidesJS, a responsive slideshow plug-in for jQuery (1.7.1+) with ... - http://www.slidesjs.com/
[21:36:06] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: that sounds good. will try
[21:40:00] <Swapnesh> @Cork thx..i will search by the way what is the difference between slide show and slider ?
[21:40:23] <Cork> ?.slider
[21:40:24] <bot-t> Cork, UI/API/1.8/Slider - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI Slider plugin makes selected elements into sliders. There are various options such as multiple handles, and ranges. The handle can be moved with the mouse or the arrow keys. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Slider
[21:40:40] <Cork> Swapnesh: slide and slideshow i would take as the same thing
[21:41:41] <Cork> but ppl love to mixed these two up so you will prob have to search for slider too, and check if it's a slider or a slideshow
[21:43:26] <Swapnesh> ok..got one but i think i need to customize it a little
[21:43:28] <Swapnesh> http://codeassembly.com/examples/gallery/index.html#previous
[21:43:45] <Swapnesh> http://codeassembly.com/examples/gallery/index.html
[21:45:43] <Swapnesh> and this result is from :- g slideshow jquery..thx i really dont this diff keyword :)
[21:49:59] <garbagegod> PAGO: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/eUTbn/1/
[21:50:33] <Swapnesh> @Cork found another one http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/touchcarousel/#carousel-image-and-text
[21:50:43] <Swapnesh> you guys are amazing !! :)
[21:51:40] <Swapnesh> my bad its not a free one :(
[21:52:07] <PAGO> garbagegod, no the songtitles functions as buttons right but they should show the lyrics in
[21:52:13] <PAGO> im
[21:52:36] <PAGO> in my case # lyrics1 #lyrics2 etc.
[21:52:41] <tw2113> the last thing the world needs right now is a new image slider
[21:52:46] <garbagegod> PAGO: reference how I used a class...
[21:52:48] <garbagegod> I g2g
[21:53:02] <PAGO> ok thx
[21:57:51] <sl33k> i have a form with no name. would this work sl33k var str = $('form').serializeArray()
[21:58:11] <Cork> no
[21:58:16] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k no
[21:58:24] <Cork> serialize builds a collection of names and values
[21:58:49] <Cork> (and you inputs should always have a name)
[21:59:05] <tw2113> always always Cork ?
[21:59:10] <Cork> yes
[21:59:28] <Cork> well except for one occasion
[21:59:40] <screamingbanshee> how do you process them on the server without names :D
[21:59:41] <vipan> hi
[21:59:47] <Cork> if you use the <input type="hidden"> as a way to store data for js
[22:00:06] <vipan> h
[22:00:08] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: getParameter() in java
[22:00:13] <Cork> then you don't need to give it a name, but for the rest of the situations it should always have a name
[22:00:26] <sl33k> ok
[22:00:29] <tw2113> it's like it's how form processing works
[22:00:30] <Cork> sl33k: you can't build a valid param string without names
[22:01:30] <newbie77> testing
[22:02:39] <sl33k> Cork: but 'form' will work here with serialize()
[22:02:43] <sl33k> ?
[22:02:49] <Cork> yes
[22:02:52] <tw2113> return true; newbie77
[22:02:56] <Cork> as long as the input fields has names
[22:06:08] <sl33k> Cork: wow works. appreciate the help
[22:11:22] <sl33k> how to prevent form submit
[22:11:37] <Cork> event.preventDefault(); in the submit event
[22:12:53] <sl33k> you are a machine
[22:13:05] <screamingbanshee> no :P
[22:13:16] <tw2113> Cork is a robot???
[22:13:22] <Cork> bot-t: is that true?
[22:13:23] <bot-t> Cork, You may rely on it.
[22:13:24] <sl33k> I mean that in a good way
[22:13:40] <tw2113> explains a lot actually
[22:14:08] <abjorn> :o
[22:14:40] <tw2113> that said, i think abjorn is a dalek
[22:15:08] <abjorn> EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!
[22:41:35] <tw2113> what is $, baby don't $ me, don't $ me, no more
[22:42:00] <Cork> O_o'
[22:42:47] <tw2113> you ok over there Cork ?
[22:43:01] <Cork> tw2113: just fine :)
[22:43:17] <Cork> tw2113: just a bit confused over your song though
[22:43:28] <tw2113> no one gets $, really
[22:44:01] <Cork> poor $
[22:44:08] <Cork> always miss understood
[22:44:24] <Cork> *misunderstood
[22:48:50] <sl33k> I submit my form using document.forms[0].submit and I click on a 'button' type for submitting. would I be able to prevent form submission ?
[22:50:00] <defa> hey guys, when your UX guys gives you the layout for a project, who decides with the id/class names once you start writing the web application?
[22:50:09] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k yes
[22:51:23] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k bind an click event listener to the button and preventDefault
[22:51:38] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: there is no submit tag to bind the event here. button click triggers a fuction which programmatically submits form
[22:51:41] <screamingbanshee> on the submit
[22:52:05] <screamingbanshee> submit is an event, sl33k
[22:52:22] <Cork> uh no
[22:52:23] <tw2113> defa, the person typing the markup
[22:52:42] <Cork> if you trigger submit on the form element directly jquery can't block it
[22:53:06] <Cork> $('form').submit() can be though
[22:53:06] <defa> defa, that means, if I am the frontend dev, I will be the one
[22:53:15] <defa> lol
[22:53:16] <sl33k> screamingbanshee: yes but I dont have a tag <input type submit > instead i have <input type button onclick = submitfunc() >
[22:53:23] <defa> tw2113, that means, if I am the frontend dev, I will be the one
[22:53:29] <tw2113> go you
[22:53:33] <tw2113> make wise decisions
[22:53:34] <screamingbanshee> lol ok hold on
[22:53:36] <tw2113> be brave, be strong
[22:53:42] <Cork> sl33k: as long as the button is inside the form it should work without js
[22:53:44] <defa> :)
[22:54:05] <Cork> sl33k: why relay on js when it's not needed
[22:54:09] <screamingbanshee> onclick
[22:54:31] <defa> tw2113, it's because it was asked to me 2 weeks ago during an interview. I felt like my answer was incorrect. He didn't say anything
[22:54:50] <tw2113> i don't think there's a right or wrong answer
[22:54:56] <sl33k> because our codebase is old. mostly plain js and I don't want to replace that just fit in jquery
[22:54:57] <tw2113> it'd be more a workflow question
[22:55:01] <defa> yup, that's what I thought too
[22:55:23] <Cork> sl33k: so replace it with $('form').eq(0).submit();
[22:55:25] <defa> i said, I name the id/class as  close to the definition of the object
[22:55:38] <Cork> sl33k: that would still generate events you can handle
[22:55:43] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k that sounds like a lot of work... to replace js with js :P
[22:55:47] <defa> thanks
[22:56:12] <sl33k> :)
[22:57:27] <screamingbanshee> @sl33k I dig it :)
[23:06:54] <sl33k> Cork: i dont have a input with submit. inout with button. would $('form').submit() be prevented?
[23:07:07] <sl33k> in my form tag i mean
[23:07:25] <Cork> $().submit() will trigger the normal form event handers yes
[23:10:06] <jedrek> is there a best-of-class query plugin for customizing scroll bars with bitmaps?
[23:10:40] <Cork> you can't customize scrollbars, you have to replace them
[23:10:53] <jedrek> yeah, i get that
[23:11:06] <jedrek> i know we're on freenode, but the pedantism isn't needed
[23:11:32] <jedrek> is there a best-of-class query plugin for replacing scroll bars with bitmaps?
[23:13:30] * tw2113 stopped trying to override sidebar appearance back in the 90s, so he doesn't know of any methods to these days
[23:14:21] <Cork> it's especially bad for mobile
[23:14:36] <Cork> as it's almost guaranteed to break there
[23:25:12] <jedrek> that's what i love about this place
[23:25:16] <jedrek> ask a question
[23:25:22] <jedrek> get multiple non-answers
[23:25:24] <jedrek> cheers
[23:34:55] <tw2113> i answered by saying i have none
[23:42:39] <harpal> I have implemented fancybox. But After adding html using AJAX its not working on newly added html. I cant find way to apply delegate method. Anyone have any solution?
[23:44:51] <Cork> harpal: you will most likely have to run the code on it again after adding new html
[23:45:05] <Cork> delegate only works for event listeners, not dom modifications
[23:47:30] <harpal> Cork: you mean write that in a function and call after finishing AJAX?
[23:47:40] <Cork> yes for example
[23:58:31] <angelazou> have a problem with hide()
[23:58:56] <angelazou> originally the element is hidden using this method, but once I want to reveal it, I want to set the visibility to inline instead of block
[23:59:07] <angelazou> so I use .css('visibility', 'inline')
[23:59:21] <Cork> visibility can't be inline
[23:59:28] <Cork> only hidden or visible
[23:59:34] <screamingbanshee> you mean display?
[23:59:35] <Cork> display is what can be inline
[23:59:55] <Cork> angelazou: and if you want it to be inline when it's visible, set it in the css file for the element
