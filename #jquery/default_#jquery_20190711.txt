[13:18:53] <MikeD_> if the delegation parent has .on('click','.someclass', function() ) and i get a reference to the child object, should child.trigger('click') be sufficient to make the event associated fire?
[13:19:24] <robertmaxrees> theoretically
[13:19:38] <robertmaxrees> tho why not abstract out the function and call it directly instead?
[13:20:46] <MikeD_> indeed.  i didn't implement the framework feature that i'm trying to make happen... i'm in a box and it's technically none of my business what's not in my box  :)
[13:20:52] <robertmaxrees> oof
[13:20:54] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[14:05:40] <makr8100> MikeD_: I use it that way all the time
[14:05:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the DOM is a poor way to proxy logic.
