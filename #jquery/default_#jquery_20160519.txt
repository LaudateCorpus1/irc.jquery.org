[04:06:39] <ircbaako> quick question if i ran $('head').append('<link ....'); if i use the .remove method will this remove it?
[04:41:24] <ircbaako> morning guys anyone jquery pro around. just wanted to add $( "head" ).insertBefore($('<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">')); just before the closing head tag
[05:57:20] <ircbaako> its really quiet here today
[06:08:33] <konrados> ircbaako what about $( "head" ).append( "<link ..." );?
[06:09:42] <ircbaako> konrados, that just put the link tag anywhere in the head i want it specifically just before the closing head tag e.g. <link ....> </head>
[06:11:39] <konrados> ircbaako are you sure? sec. I'll try it
[06:15:00] <konrados> ircbaako, I've just tried that and as I expected it added at the end (just before the closing tag), maybe you did something wrong, or maybe later you add more elements?
[06:15:39] <ircbaako> konrados, i have alot of things in my head tag
[06:15:48] <ircbaako> have alot of other css files and meta tag
[06:16:08] <ircbaako> i tried it and it didnt add it at the end
[06:16:21] <konrados> ircbaako,  can you make a jsfiddle?
[06:16:43] <ircbaako> jsfiddle doesnt seem to work when trying to do it
[06:19:30] <ircbaako> konrados, dont matter will figure it out thanks
[06:19:50] <konrados> ok
[06:39:18] <ircbaako> hi https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/14/ if you look at the end of the it you will still see {{}}
[06:42:45] <ircbaako> https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/15/ and also the table is messed up
[06:55:07] <ircbaako> am off back later
[06:55:12] <antoon> Hi guys. I'm filling <div id='test'> using $('<div/>').attr('id', 'test-'+x).html(y).appendTo('#test') where x and y is ajax data - and that works as intended. But when I do $('#test div:last').attr('id') I do not get anything. Am I doing something wrong?
[07:09:07] <Cork> antoon: it should work as long as the first line has executed before you run the second one
[07:10:03] <antoon> i hate my life
[07:10:21] <antoon> I was in the wrong function indeed. The ajax gets executed after
[07:10:21] <antoon> :(
[07:10:53] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0dzaL5ss/
[07:11:53] <antoon> My function got fired after the ajax request was initiated, instead of inside the success() callback
[08:06:22] <philm88> hey all. I'm using a library that gets a datepicker ui & updates a regular text input with the value. Unfortauntely, the library swallows up the text input's change event and instead fires a 'dp.change' event on a parent element. I'm trying to translate that dp.change event to a change event on the actual input element like this; https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8872055 -- but for some reason, ...
[08:06:29] <philm88> ... that doesn't hit my change event listener
[08:07:21] <philm88> my event listener is basically; $('input[name=the_input]').on('change', function(e) { // do stuff })
[08:10:08] <philm88> I've also tried $(e.target).find('input')[0].dispatchEvent(new Event('change')) with no luck too
[08:13:56] <philm88> I can see the body of my dp.change listener is fired and that $(e.target).find('input') gets the right input element and chrome's debug tools recognise that I've got a listener on that input's change event - but still no bueno
[08:19:40] <philm88> ah crap - nevermind. figured it out. The library's nuking of the change event seems to happen even if changes are made to the input element completely seperately to the library
[09:07:00] <xqo> hi, I'm having a problem where .on, .load, .one are affecting every instance of the event-type, not the ones where my selected element is the event target
[09:07:27] <xqo> so here, line 5 is .one, and is preventing line 15 from ever firing: https://bpaste.net/show/4a9102df18fa
[09:07:34] <xqo> how can I fix this problem?
[09:08:23] <xqo> https://bpaste.net/show/1821e5f3cb38 *
[09:19:15] <AdamPDotty> I am not sure you can usefully add load event handlers on objects outside the DOM.
[09:36:37] <Cork> you can
[09:37:42] <Cork> xqo: but what is the point of only adding the src to the img tag in the page when it has been loaded?
[09:37:54] <Cork> not sure what you're trying to do here
[09:38:51] <xqo> Cork:  im trying to first load thumbnails, then i want to load fullsize images later
[09:39:05] <xqo> so i dont have to wait for an endless loading spinner before starting to use the app
[09:39:14] <Cork> hmm
[09:39:30] <Cork> a better option might be to add the image to the page as the user scrolls
[09:39:38] <Cork> else you end up having to load the image twice
[09:40:18] <xqo> its a carousel of images
[09:40:29] <Cork> xqo: also just creating the img tag in js and injecting it will result in the same effect
[09:40:35] <xqo> we load a 500 byte tiny thumbnail first for every image that are stretched to full dimensions
[09:40:47] <Cork> so the FullFrame thing won't really give you anything
[09:40:59] <xqo> and from the beginning of the carousel i want to fan out fullsize images in both directions
[09:41:12] <Cork> hmm
[09:41:17] <Cork> ok
[09:41:22] <Cork> what is the problem though?
[09:41:50] <xqo> the <img> src is never updated, because line 16 never fires
[09:42:04] <xqo> when line 5 is .one, line 16 is also affected
[09:42:31] <xqo> i tried making line 5 a .on, and then inside the .on event handler, unbinding it, but that unbind also affected line 15
[09:43:18] <Cork> ya, cause line 18 changes the image to fullsize_
[09:43:27] <Cork> so the thumbnail aborts
[09:43:44] <Cork> you would have to wait for the onload of the thumbnail before you change the src
[09:44:43] <Cork> unless the calling order is different (it isn't easy to tell how you're calling this code)
[09:45:01] <Cork> it would be preferable if you make a jsfiddle with the context this is running in
[09:50:03] <groundup> How do I get it to loop through this and actually get the elements of the array and then its objects? http://jsbin.com/kehinaneqi/edit?js,console
[09:51:53] <Cork> (don't use jsbin it loses changes all over the place
[09:51:57] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
[09:52:19] <groundup> https://jsfiddle.net/tftfv5Lq/
[09:53:27] <groundup> Not sure how to add jQuery
[09:53:51] <WilsonG> Hi scripters
[09:54:02] <saslam_> groundup: just add it as external source
[09:54:06] <saslam_> the cdn link
[09:54:15] <groundup> ok
[09:54:33] <WilsonG> Is it possible to break a seTimeout which is fired in loop ?
[09:54:42] <groundup> Done: https://jsfiddle.net/tftfv5Lq/4/
[09:55:07] <Cork> groundup: https://jsfiddle.net/tftfv5Lq/5/
[09:55:16] <Cork> don't use $().each for objects and arrays
[09:55:21] <Cork> it is for looping elements
[09:55:50] <Cork> also jsfiddle already has jquery (the javascript grear dropdown)
[09:56:42] <groundup> Ugh, thanks
[09:56:50] <groundup> Stupid mistake and I've been staring at this all day
[09:57:00] <saslam_> cork, oh I didn't know that about jsFiddle, thx!
[09:57:47] <xqo> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/3m8c3joa/
[09:58:02] <xqo> cork there is a live test at http://nana.io/chandler/
[09:58:50] <xqo> Cork:  line 126 is what tries to load the fullsize version of the first image in the carousel, for testing
[09:59:35] <xqo> except never, because line 67 does not fire when line 60 exists
[09:59:38] <decx> did you just send 600 requests
[09:59:40] <Cork> xqo: well the else case also loads both
[09:59:41] <Cork> so...
[10:00:02] <Cork> i think you have a logic error in when you do each here
[10:00:11] <xqo> Cork: loadImage loads a thumbnail
[10:00:23] <Cork> xqo: it also calls fullImage()
[10:00:33] <Cork> sorry frame.loadFullFrame();
[10:00:48] <Cork> uh... BAH
[10:00:54] <xqo> no it doesnt
[10:00:57] <Cork> ok i mixed up this.img and img...
[10:02:18] <Cork> hmm not sure why this isn't working
[10:02:22] <Cork> it is doing what it should be
[10:03:03] <xqo> Cork:  when line 60 is not a .one, but a .on,
[10:03:09] <xqo> then the full image is loaded
[10:03:16] <xqo> but the dragging breaks
[10:03:22] <Cork> ah
[10:05:00] <WilsonG> https://jsfiddle.net/4gteapk8/1/ is there a possibilty to stop the setTimeout from else statement?
[10:07:06] <Cork> xqo: i would prob recommend using on and clearing the listener in the imageLoaded instead
[10:07:38] <Cork> xqo: you can do something like .on('load:thumbnailloader', imageLoaded);
[10:07:50] <xqo> Cork:  i used on and cleared the listener from within the .on-listener, and got the same problem as now where the fullsize does not load
[10:07:51] <Cork> and $(this).off(':thumbnailloader')
[10:07:59] <xqo> what is this syntax?
[10:08:03] <Cork> namespace
[10:08:40] <Cork> xqo: if you run off in imageLoader it shouldn't cause that problem unless something else breaks
[10:09:47] <xqo> I will try, thank you
[10:11:07] <Cork> WilsonG: yes, but your firing a lot of timers
[10:11:15] <Cork> not sure you should fire that many
[10:11:30] <Cork> ugg
[10:11:42] <Cork> you queue off one for every slide...
[10:11:56] <Cork> WilsonG: why not just have them wait for the previous one?
[10:14:40] <Cork> WilsonG: https://jsfiddle.net/4gteapk8/4/
[10:14:57] <Cork> bah borked the start line...
[10:15:14] <Cork> WilsonG: https://jsfiddle.net/4gteapk8/5/
[10:19:18] <xqo> Cork: can you tell why the spinner takes so long to get ready?
[10:19:28] <xqo> it loads 598 <600bytes jpegs
[10:19:46] <WilsonG> https://jsfiddle.net/4gteapk8/6/ Now its complete, thanks Cork
[10:21:34] <smgs> hi! how to click on a clickable text the moment it appears inside a website. it is regarding flashsales. thanks
[10:24:42] <xqo> Cork: let me ask another way, decx mentioned making 600 requests and he is right. each requests takes some 70ms
[10:24:50] <xqo> is there some way to fetch all the images without making 600 requests?

[11:33:08] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys I can't figure out how to reset droppable. If a droppable container has the class .ui-selected I want it disabled, which only would on the first select attempt, if I reselect droppable elements and try to drag to a class with .ui-selected it isnt disabled. Here is a fiddle demonstrating the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/3gggh6bg/18/
[11:34:23] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> for better readability: https://jsfiddle.net/3gggh6bg/19/
[11:51:59] <dochttpd> hi, i have a bootstrap template that im using to build my web application. when i use window.print(), i can print a page with styling but wen i use jquery, $('#invoice').print(); most of the styling is gone. how can i ensure that i retain the styling?
[11:54:57] <bango2> dochttpd, sounds like youre trying to print an element instead of the whole window, so styling thats not directly in #invoice will be negated?
[11:55:00] <bango2> just a guess
[11:57:18] <dochttpd> bango2: yup, window.print() prints the whole page with styling applied. but it has this /page.html hanging at the top. so i wanted to just print a div which contains the invoice. but i see what you mean. thanks!
[11:57:32] <guest_> Hi, is there someone here who can help me with a jquery serialization problem?
[11:59:44] <guest_> I'm trying to serialize my form, but when i "$('.project-info-form').serializeArray()" it returns "undefined". This is the form html: http://prntscr.com/b5z05f
[12:05:11] <bango2> guest_ try .first().serializeArray()
[12:05:45] <guest_> Didn't work
[12:08:16] <bango2> thy thissun http://pastebin.com/3PGF39em
[12:09:30] <guest_> values = Object {}
[12:09:57] <guest_> The problem is that the "$('.project-info-form').serializeArray()" returns undefined
[12:18:06] <guest_> I'm trying to serialize my form, but when i "$('.project-info-form').serializeArray()" it returns "undefined". This is the form html: http://prntscr.com/b5z05f. Is there someone here that can help me with this?
[12:18:21] <z1haze1> any gulp users in here?
[12:18:36] <z1haze1> I need help creating a gulpfile for a big project
[12:21:29] <robertmaxrees> guest_ sure, start by making a fiddle instead of a screenshot :)
[12:22:29] <robertmaxrees> z1haze1 you can try asking, but no guarantees that you'll get help ;)
[12:24:14] <z1haze1> i just asked xD I basically need to create a custom toolbuilder for a intellij project
[12:25:13] <robertmaxrees> "toolbuilder"?
[12:25:34] <robertmaxrees> and by "you can try asking" i mean "be more specific about what you need"
[12:26:18] <guest_> robertmaxress the problem is that is works in fiddle but not in my environment
[12:26:33] <robertmaxrees> guest_ okay - any console errors on your environment?
[12:27:18] <guest_> robertmaxrees i'm getting the following error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined"
[12:27:39] <robertmaxrees> so then you need to fix that :)
[12:28:17] <guest_> I know i need to fix that, but i don't know what is problem is really
[12:28:33] <robertmaxrees> that error is very likely causing the rest of the page to break
[12:28:48] <robertmaxrees> so fixing that may resolve your current issue.  if not, then at least we know it's not that.
[12:29:10] <guest_> When i use serializeArray() instead of serialize() it returns undefined
[12:29:22] <robertmaxrees> okay - so now you're being more specific.
[12:29:34] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[12:29:44] <guest_> 2.2.1
[12:29:54] <guest_> I've tried going to 2.2.3 but that didn't do much
[12:30:05] <robertmaxrees> when you use serialize() does the other error go away?
[12:30:27] <guest_> I only get the error when i use serialize()
[12:30:44] <robertmaxrees> are you loading jquery twice or something?
[12:30:56] <robertmaxrees> can you toss out a link to the page in question in the channel?
[12:31:08] <guest_> It's localhost
[12:31:27] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  if it works in jsfiddle there's a bigger problem.
[12:31:33] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not loading jquery twice.
[12:31:48] <guest_> Seems like i'm only loading it once
[12:32:22] <robertmaxrees> so if you open your network tab and filter by "jquery" you only see one copy of the library?
[12:32:31] <robertmaxrees> because at this point I'd need to see the actual page.
[12:32:41] <buddyq> I am trying to run a very simple online jquery rule to change text if success with php but it's not working. It seems like it's not firing. How can I fire jquery if something happens with php?
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> buddyq you can't.
[12:33:16] <robertmaxrees> buddyq javascript and php live in two entirely different worlds.
[12:33:55] <guest_> These are the resources i'm loading: http://prntscr.com/b5zfmg
[12:33:58] <buddyq> has to be able to be done in some way
[12:34:08] <robertmaxrees> guest_ please link code, not screenshots.
[12:34:15] <buddyq> maybe not within, but how can I fire an outside function?
[12:34:19] <robertmaxrees> or paste data.
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> buddyq you cannot fire javascript via php.
[12:34:53] <robertmaxrees> guest_ yeah, something is way broken.  no idea without seeing the page.
[12:34:54] <buddyq> robertmaxrees: but you can fire a javascript function essentially
[12:35:01] <robertmaxrees> buddyq not via php.
[12:35:29] <robertmaxrees> you can output text to the browser - some of that text could be a script tag that calls a function.
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> but you can't just call javascript from php randomly.
[12:35:38] <buddyq> if(!$success) { ?><script>function halo()</script> } wont work?
[12:35:53] <robertmaxrees> buddyq are you talking about on pageload ooorr...?
[12:36:03] <buddyq> no. done via ajax.
[12:36:11] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you're doing an ajax call.
[12:36:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to attach a .done() call to the ajax call.
[12:36:24] <guest_> robertmaxrees can i maybe add you on something so i can share my page with you?
[12:36:32] <robertmaxrees> guest_ i'd rather you didn't.
[12:36:37] <guest_> okay np
[12:40:33] <guest_> robertmaxrees can you view this page: http://84.31.129.252/klantportaal/public/projects/create
[12:41:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> so how do I replicate your issue?
[12:41:33] <guest_> If you click on save you will get the error
[12:44:40] <guest_> robertmaxrees did you get the error?
[12:44:49] <robertmaxrees> sorry, doing a few different this
[12:44:51] <robertmaxrees> *things
[12:44:54] <robertmaxrees> yes.  i see it.
[12:44:55] <robertmaxrees> give me a few.
[12:44:58] <guest_> Okay
[12:46:29] <robertmaxrees> something here seems WAY off.
[12:46:47] <guest_> I know, just can't find what it is
[12:48:32] <robertmaxrees> i'
[12:48:54] <robertmaxrees> *i'd try using a CDN version of jquery and jquery ui real quick so see if there's something wrong with the copies you have.
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you may have invalid markup.
[12:50:45] <guest_> Didn't change much
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> but did something change?
[12:51:13] <guest_> No
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:51:24] <Uhkis> why does it make a get request on serialize O_o
[12:51:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not his issue fwiw ;)
[12:55:56] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if bootstrap is causing you any headaches
[12:58:41] <robertmaxrees> found it.
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> view-source:http://84.31.129.252/klantportaal/public/assets/js/ajax-requests.js
[12:58:52] <robertmaxrees> something you're doing in here is breaking it.
[12:59:10] <guest_> Okay i'll have a look, ty
[12:59:22] <robertmaxrees> your extend call, specifically.
[12:59:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/y2rytyv9/
[13:00:47] <Uhkis> so that was his issue!
[13:01:14] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any reference to serialize in that file.
[13:04:21] <guest_> There is a problem with the function names, they seem to conflict with maybe some default jquery functions
[13:04:31] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah.
[13:04:44] <robertmaxrees> you know you don't need to extend jquery for any of that, right?
[13:05:01] <guest_> Yeah, looking at it now i see xD
[13:05:13] <Uhkis> you might wanna use the non-minimized versions while developing
[13:05:29] <robertmaxrees> nah, just don't extend the api for things like that :)
[13:06:06] <guest_> Thank you for the help!
[13:06:10] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:26:15] <z1haze1> generally when using wildcards as * to watch directories for like gulp or somehing, would '/dir/**/*.scss mean anything in /dir/ and children directories of dir with .scss extensions?
[13:26:19] <z1haze1> im not sure what the ** means
[13:26:59] <taplar> typically ** means any nested directory
[13:27:01] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/8532962
[13:27:11] <robertmaxrees> current and all child directories.
[15:06:56] <hydrogen> I'm not certain this is the perfect venue for this question, but I'm working on a project with the isotope jquery plugin, and trying to isotope "lazy-loaded" images in an infinite scroll kind of situation.  It works fine initially, but it seems like the isotope() call isn't happening on the append.  has anyone done something similar that might have an opinion if I paste some code? :)
[15:51:54] <jquestion> Hi everybody, I've a problem here, there is a form and two .on('submit') for it, how do I stop the 2nd .on('submit') which I cannot edit to just not happen when something happens on the first .on() ?
[15:52:36] <robertmaxrees> is it bound after the first one?
[15:53:16] <jquestion> robertmaxrees: actually no, I'm actually trying to prevent the first one
[15:53:26] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to fully remove it then.
[15:53:59] <jquestion> robertmaxrees: is there any way to do save it and remove it to just prevent it and then kinda add it again
[15:54:16] <robertmaxrees> not without accessing a private api that you can't guarantee access to in the future.
[15:54:28] <robertmaxrees> why can't you edit the original handler?
[15:55:06] <jquestion> robertmaxrees: the first one comes from a wp plugin which I shouldn't edit because otherwise it'll be overridden on the next update
[15:55:14] <robertmaxrees> very much so.
[15:55:25] <robertmaxrees> i hate those cases.
[15:55:43] <jquestion> robertmaxrees: yeah
[15:55:46] <robertmaxrees> what does the plugin do for you?>
[15:56:27] <jquestion> robertmaxrees: it's essential for the form, can't remove it, it has to stay there
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> just making sure.
[15:58:22] <jquestion> robertmaxrees: I'm not that good at jq and so on so it may sound silly but isn't there a way to like change the order in the queue
[15:58:50] <robertmaxrees> remember that aprt where i mentioned the private api?
[15:58:56] <jquestion> I mean I can load my js "before" the plugin js I'm not sure if it makes any difference anyway but isn't there any jq way to do something like that to like force the first on() to happen after my own
[16:00:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ see what i just said :)
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> if you bound your handler first, there's a way to handle that.
[16:00:46] <robertmaxrees> but you can't really modify the queue after the fact.
[16:01:52] <jquestion_> robertmaxrees: sorry lost the chat
[16:01:55] <jquestion_> what kinda api
[16:02:08] <robertmaxrees> the private api - as in, one you shouldn't access.
[16:02:49] <jquestion_> what if I just make sure "my" js loads before that js
[16:03:27] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[16:05:30] <jquestion_> robertmaxrees: ah
[16:06:55] <robertmaxrees> making more sense?
[16:06:59] <jquestion_> robertmaxrees: it worked!
[16:07:03] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:07:09] <jquestion_> robertmaxrees: exactly what I was looking for
[16:07:26] <jquestion_> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[16:08:51] <Baako> https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/15/ guys why does it still show the {{
[16:09:23] <Baako> also the layout is not nicely formatted for a table
[16:10:05] <robertmaxrees> where do you replace the text in the markup?
[16:11:59] <robertmaxrees> baako
[16:13:40] <decx> it's not part of the template, also the template html doesnt include the table tags as html() is innerHTML
[16:13:57] <Baako> robertmaxrees i have also tried https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/16/
[16:14:37] <robertmaxrees> againb
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> where do you actually edit the page?
[16:15:01] <Baako> cardinfo robertmaxrees
[16:15:12] <robertmaxrees> duder
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> you never replace the text that's on the page.
[16:15:22] <robertmaxrees> you just add new stuff.
[16:19:34] <Baako> robertmaxrees, should i use replace with?
[16:19:40] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you storing the template on the page like that in the first place?
[16:20:15] <decx> quote "i don't want to use script tags"
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> great - why?
[16:21:05] <decx> it's not that weird
[16:21:12] <decx> vue does it
[16:21:38] <decx> then again, i did tell you weeks ago not to use my weird microtemplate vanity function ^^
[16:21:40] <robertmaxrees> >.> not saying it's weird, just wondering what he's planning on doing instead.
[16:21:57] <robertmaxrees> like, he's been cobbling this thing together for weeks.
[16:22:14] <decx> i dont get the error btw
[16:22:21] <decx> that's something that would come from your server
[16:22:32] <Baako> robertmaxrees, and decx https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/11/ this was before
[16:22:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:23:02] <decx> yeah i remember, i wrote that ^^
[16:23:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:23:20] <robertmaxrees> good luck Baako
[16:23:34] <Baako> robertmaxrees, why?
[16:24:30] <decx> it's a weird way to do a payment gateway
[16:24:50] <decx> like where would this data even come from and in what context
[16:25:13] <Baako> decx, the data comes from the payment gateway
[16:25:22] <Baako> i am just displaying it to the user
[16:25:41] <decx> so the user can add cards to their profile or soemthing
[16:25:56] <Baako> decx yes
[16:26:09] <Baako> in my case i want them to confirm their full card number
[16:26:18] <Baako> because they have changed their shipping address
[16:26:58] <decx> so how do you get that data
[16:27:04] <decx> why is it clientside
[16:27:25] <Baako> serverside then display it clientside
[16:27:50] <Baako> decx, have you used amazon before?
[16:28:04] <decx> is that what that's for
[16:28:22] <Baako> if you change your shipping address or add a new one it ask you to confirm your full card number
[16:28:28] <Baako> decx, its not for amazon
[16:29:04] <decx> seems like a security nightmare in the making
[16:29:29] <decx> this is where i always stay back and say: yes payment interface programmers i will do whatever you say
[16:30:15] <decx> also i dont even know what your current problem is
[16:30:20] <decx> kinda just jumped into here ^^
[16:32:27] <Baako> decx, do you think i shouldnt do it?
[16:34:16] <decx> nope
[16:34:38] <Baako> decx, i have more or less done it backend just need to do the layout client side
[16:35:28] <decx> anytime i hear payment or saved sensitive data i fall off my chair into a fetal position
[16:35:37] <decx> it's a safety mechanism
[16:35:43] <robertmaxrees> woah
[16:35:47] <robertmaxrees> sorry i was away.
[16:35:48] <robertmaxrees> nooooo.
[16:36:08] <robertmaxrees> who are you handling payments through?
[16:36:21] <Baako> stripe robertmaxrees
[16:36:29] <robertmaxrees> but how are you getting back full cc#s?
[16:37:04] <Baako> robertmaxrees, ?
[16:37:09] <Baako> cc#c?
[16:37:19] <robertmaxrees> cc numbers
[16:37:31] <Baako> whats cc number?
[16:37:35] <robertmaxrees> credit card
[16:37:35] <Baako> you mean cvc
[16:37:39] <Baako> you dont
[16:37:47] <robertmaxrees> "<Baako> in my case i want them to confirm their full card number"
[16:37:49] <Baako> you get a hash
[16:38:01] <robertmaxrees> so you're asking the user to input a new number.
[16:38:04] <robertmaxrees> along with their address.
[16:38:10] <Baako> nope
[16:38:18] <Baako> just the card number
[16:38:18] <robertmaxrees> then what's the workflow?
[16:38:40] <Baako> you ask them to enter their card number you send it to stripe
[16:38:55] <robertmaxrees> so hi - i work at a large ecommerce company.  i know how it's supposed to work.
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking what you're tyring to accomplish.
[16:39:05] <Baako> stipe hash the card number give it to you then you compare it to the card hash you asked them to confirm
[16:39:53] <decx> so to change the shipping address you need to enter the card number as a security question?
[16:39:59] <decx> am i getting this right?
[16:40:11] <Baako> decx, yes that is what i want to do
[16:40:16] <decx> well don't
[16:40:22] <Baako> its not a stripe requirement
[16:40:27] <robertmaxrees> then don't worry about it.
[16:40:30] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[16:41:27] <Baako> robertmaxrees, why i want to do it is because a customer complain saying that someone placed an order and it wasnt them and it was delivered to an address miles away from their original shipping address
[16:41:47] <decx> yeah but what you plan here would be the illusion of safety while achieving the opposite, like voting republican
[16:41:54] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[16:41:59] <robertmaxrees> right, you're not actually solving anything.
[16:42:11] <Baako> robertmaxrees, how come?
[16:42:12] <robertmaxrees> somebody else comitted fruad.
[16:42:36] <robertmaxrees> that person needs to, like, contact to police.
[16:42:54] <Baako> they did and their bank contact us
[16:43:07] <Baako> so had to refund them until the investation is over
[16:43:18] <robertmaxrees> great.  that's about all you can do.  sucks.
[16:43:22] <Baako> until then we are out of money plus the product
[16:43:32] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're incorporated (you ARE incorporated, right?)
[16:43:47] <sbs> hi
[16:43:47] <Baako> robertmaxrees,
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> trust me, you'll have enough of that stuff going on that you budget for it.
[16:43:55] <sbs> can anyone help with jqueryui?
[16:44:08] <robertmaxrees> sbs yep - if you have a question, just ask.
[16:44:10] <decx> ask and you shall receive
[16:44:28] <decx> what kind of word is shall anyway
[16:44:31] <decx> looks weird
[16:44:40] <robertmaxrees> #english
[16:45:04] <Baako> robertmaxrees, stripe doesnt support similar thing like cvc verification which is quiet stupid and according to their programmer which they are right cvc is only 3 - 4 numbers which someone can remember easily
[16:45:15] <sbs> I have a simple selectormenu, but when it drops is extends the page width, spans all the way to the right way beyond what is needed, does not capture the mouse and does not close when doing a selection using enter
[16:45:19] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) that's their problem, not yours.
[16:45:36] <sbs> it this common of forgetting something important, but newbs just don't know
[16:45:40] <sbs> ?
[16:46:11] <robertmaxrees> sbs can you setup an example at https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cygsfwzw/ ?
[16:46:42] <decx> already everything loaded whata service
[16:46:52] <robertmaxrees> ^ ;)
[16:47:17] <robertmaxrees> Baako i can tell you feel burned, but that's part of the cost of doing business.  you're just going to make things harder for yourself and other customers in the long run.
[16:47:52] <Uhkis> someones tired of "you dont have jquery in the fiddle" :-D
[16:48:14] <robertmaxrees> or "i can't make a fiddle" and then hearing "i can't have jquery"
[16:48:19] <Baako> robertmaxrees, okay
[16:48:21] <robertmaxrees> or any of the 1000s of variations
[16:48:26] <buddyq_> hi guys, not sure how to debug this form. wordpress using contact form 7 and it goes to blank page. if I have the console open I can see it turn red after form submission but then goes to blank page. Not sure how to see what the red stuff is. Can someone help? http://supersized.agentassets.com/contact/
[16:48:37] <Uhkis> nice idea :)
[16:48:45] <buddyq_> to test only name, email, message are required
[16:48:48] <buddyq_> thx
[16:49:00] <robertmaxrees> buddyq_ sounds like a wordpress question.
[16:49:25] <buddyq_> well, i'm pretty sure it has something to do with jquery etc.
[16:49:43] <buddyq_> actually, i thought since these errors are popping up in CONSOLE.....
[16:50:00] <buddyq_> its gonna be javascript because it happens AFTER I click the submit button, right?
[16:50:30] <robertmaxrees> did you write any code?  or just install a plugin?
[16:50:38] <buddyq_> i thought someone who might know how to freeze these errors in action can tell me what it is or tell me how to freeze these errors so I can look at them.
[16:50:58] <buddyq_> just install plugin which is working fine on my other sites in this multisite network using the exact same plugin.
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> contact the author then :)
[16:51:14] <decx> cf7 has lots of support
[16:51:19] <robertmaxrees> looks like the JS isn't actually doing anything.
[16:51:40] <buddyq_> did you try the form and look at console and see those red erorrs before it reloads the page?
[16:51:45] <decx> right that's all backend
[16:51:45] <robertmaxrees> npope.
[16:52:31] <buddyq_> ok. are you guys just gate keepers or something?
[16:52:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[16:52:50] <buddyq_> why are you in this room?
[16:52:59] <buddyq_> im curious.
[16:53:10] <buddyq_> to get help from other people?
[16:53:12] <robertmaxrees> we're here to provide support to developers for the jquery
[16:53:27] <buddyq_> ah... just not if its inside a plugin?
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> you have a wordpress plugin - that involves a lot of different moving parts.  you can feel free to ask questions here about jquery/js, but you're not going to get much help with WP.
[16:54:21] <decx> it's always a guessing game with wp plugins
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:54:32] <robertmaxrees> you're much more likely to get assistance from the plugin author.
[16:54:44] <decx> na just stack, cf7 is super popular
[16:54:55] <buddyq_> my question related to the console and freezing the page upon clicking the submit button. Seems like that would be directly related to js/jquery no?
[16:54:58] <robertmaxrees> it's less about "why don't we support it" and more of a question of "how can you best get support and waste as little of your time as possible"
[16:55:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, but as apart of a wordpress plugin that you don't want to edit.
[16:55:55] <buddyq_> so you bypass the ability to tell someone how to step through code to see what the errors may be telling them?
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:11] <robertmaxrees> you're really misconstruing my point.
[16:56:25] <buddyq_> isn't it possible to stepthrough javascript and code on any given page?
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> i want you to get help as fast as possible.  asking here isn't going to accomplish that.
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> sure - fixingthesejquery.com has a great guide on how to do that.
[16:56:46] <robertmaxrees> but you aren't really going to want to edit the source of the plugin.
[16:56:48] <decx> na
[16:56:52] <decx> i'd check my php logs
[16:56:54] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure why you want to do that.
[16:57:04] <buddyq_> i probably dont have to edit the plugin if it works on 100 other sites of mine right?
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ the issue could be due to all kinds of things when wp plugins are involved.
[16:57:11] <buddyq_> seems pretty localized.
[16:57:18] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it's wp.
[16:57:36] <buddyq_> so support is a link and a shrug.
[16:57:38] <buddyq_> lol.
[16:57:39] <buddyq_> nice
[16:57:56] <buddyq_> i hope you're doing this for your own amusement then and not getting paid.
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:58:17] <decx> this guy
[16:58:25] <robertmaxrees> absolutely doing this for free - i'd appreciate you to be a little more respectful :)
[16:59:21] <robertmaxrees> generally when people have standalone test cases of their jquery-specific issues, they get tons of support.
[16:59:30] <buddyq_> this guy?
[16:59:35] <buddyq_> lol, you guys!
[16:59:53] <robertmaxrees> you're just being kind of rude, that's all.  we're trying to help you get the assistance you're looking for as fast as possible.
[17:00:32] <buddyq_> robertmaxrees: I find it hilarious that you guys want respect because you sit in this room. Not sure how that garners you any respect when you haven't earned it. You DO expect people to earn respect and not just get it for essentially being a DMV worker.
[17:00:43] <decx> jesus christ ban this cunt
[17:00:54] <robertmaxrees> hey not ok language decx
[17:00:58] <buddyq_> robertmaxrees: i know you think what youre saying is true but its not.
[17:01:21] <decx> i call it like i see it sorry bud
[17:01:30] <decx> trump2016 and shit /s
[17:01:31] <robertmaxrees> it's ok, just not an OK work 'round these parts :)
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> *word
[17:01:45] <decx> let's pretend i'm australian
[17:01:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, homeslice really needs to check his attitude.
[17:02:39] <robertmaxrees> looks like a realtor who was trying to build his own site and is trying to get free dev work.
[17:02:57] <decx> the photo took my pants off tho
[17:04:22] <arc_> to me this looks more like somebody who's trying to create a template he can sell to people
[17:05:52] <robertmaxrees> whatever it is i'm relatively unimpressed by people who don't understand the idea of "hey we can't really help you here"
[17:06:17] <decx> the form didnt even have an event btw
[17:06:24] <decx> man devtools in ff is nice
[17:06:33] <decx> kicked firebug in the bucket couple of months ago
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> right?!
[17:06:45] <robertmaxrees> i've been LOVING ff dev edition
[17:07:04] <decx> oh right
[17:07:08] <decx> that's a thing that exists
[17:08:15] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:15:36] <sbs>  how does one control the z-order of jqueryui items. Mine show behind the openlayers layers
[17:15:45] <sbs> I'd rather have them above
[17:32:09] <decx> write a css class for that element
[17:36:40] <robertmaxrees> yaaaaaaaay
[18:11:12] <paulvd> I was just going some testing, how can I use conditional statements within strings like ? var showing = 'Showing ' + if (svalue){ + '"' + svalue + '"' + } +' Candidates'; er
[18:11:36] <decx> you want a ternary operator
[18:11:36] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[18:11:48] <robertmaxrees> you do a ternary that coditionally returns what you want.
[19:29:13] <paulvd> so many people leaving?
[19:29:22] <robertmaxrees> 4:30 on the west coast.
[19:29:30] <robertmaxrees> people starting to pack up and go home/log off.
[19:29:49] <paulvd> ye
[22:28:09] <jeesss> can i ask about promise here, if I have a then with no reject function, and I pass it reject, it auto passes reject?
[22:59:05] <dw1> .html('<a id="b_main_add" href="#" data-role="button" data-icon="plus" data-theme="a">Add</a>');
[22:59:10] <dw1> why no data interpretation
[22:59:37] <dw1> and $("#b_main_add").click() doesnt work either :/
[22:59:41] <dw1> after that
[22:59:54] <dw1> hmm
[23:06:53] <dw1> fixed the last part - was using pages anyway so just needed the href not a click
[23:07:14] * dw1 still wonders how to get data-role="button" to work in an .html()
