[01:07:56] <K4T> hello
[01:13:25] <K4T> can someone help me with replace li tag of cloned element to div?
[01:13:30] <K4T> here is my problem: http://pastebin.com/wLNfDwD6
[01:16:30] <K4T> I tried something like this: $clonedPostCommentForm.appendTo($(this).closest('.comment')).unwrap().wrap('<div class="media media-post-comment"></div>');
[01:16:35] <K4T> but without success
[01:19:39] <Cork> K4T: you can't change the type of an element
[01:19:54] <heythere> hello there guys http://jsfiddle.net/EfqAL/ i got this but its not working, problem is it finds data as undefined when trying to convert them! any ideas?
[01:20:04] <seutje> $('.media-post-comment').replaceWidth(function() { return $('div', {'class': this.className} ).append($(this).children()); }); or something?
[01:20:14] <seutje> replaceWith*... every time
[01:20:37] <seutje> and 'div' -> '<div>'
[01:20:47] <K4T> let me check
[01:21:18] <Cork> seutje: except he just wants the first one
[01:21:25] <Cork> but ya
[01:21:59] <K4T> correct, and I do not want to remove li content
[01:22:08] <K4T> I just want to replace li tag to div
[01:22:28] <seutje> so much for the checking
[01:22:34] <Cork> var post = $('.media-post-comment:first'); $('<div>', { class: post.prop('className') }).append(post.children().clone())
[01:23:01] <Cork> very similar, but ya
[01:23:10] <seutje> but it's not in the dom though
[01:23:27] <K4T> and I can not change that li element in  $('.media-post-comment:first');
[01:23:29] <Cork> he never shows what he wants to do with the clone
[01:23:32] <seutje> just gets eaten by the GC
[01:23:38] <K4T> I have to change it only in cloned element
[01:23:53] <K4T> I want to append it
[01:24:00] <seutje> wait, do u wanna have a div that's a copy of an li or u wanna replace the li with the div? o.O
[01:24:09] <K4T> and that appended version must be with div not li ;p
[01:24:17] <seutje> oh
[01:24:28] <seutje> yeah, then use Cork's
[01:24:29] <Cork> var post = $('.media-post-comment:first'); $(this).closest('.comment').append($('<div>', { class: post.prop('className') }).append(post.children().clone()));
[01:24:36] <K4T> yeah, black magic happens here
[01:24:43] <seutje> not rly
[01:24:53] <Cork> it just creates a new div
[01:24:57] <K4T> will check your solution Cork, gimme sec
[01:25:02] <Cork> copies the className value
[01:25:10] <Cork> and clones all the children of the original element
[01:25:15] <Cork> no magic here :)
[01:25:45] * seutje throws some sparkles around
[01:26:11] <seutje> oh, right... *black* magic
[01:26:21] <Cork> lol
[01:26:25] <K4T> Cork: thank you!
[01:27:07] * K4T gives Cork an apple
[01:28:45] <Cork> K4T: you think i'm a piglet or something? :)
[01:31:56] <K4T> are you?
[01:31:57] <K4T> :P
[01:32:35] <seutje> thanks for that mental image of a piglet writing javascript
[01:33:22] <Cork> with an apple in the mouth
[01:33:57] <seutje> only way to piglet!
[01:36:34] <heythere> am pregnant
[01:37:44] <seutje> these advertisement agencies... "put this script in the body" a .js file containing a <script> tag... a.a
[01:37:48] <seutje> q.q even
[01:38:34] <Cork> seutje: lovely...
[01:39:00] <seutje> kinda scared to fix it, it's been in production like this for over a year
[01:40:38] <sacho_> wait what
[01:40:41] <sacho_> how does that even work?
[01:41:32] <Cork> sacho_: the js engine recovers from the error i assume
[01:41:50] <Cork> was a long time since i saw it last so don't remember how it works
[01:57:22] <tirengarfio> I have this code: https://gist.github.com/Ziiweb/52b227ee5e9a311ad421 As you can see, Im using data-role="listview" but I still dont get the visualization for the list as expected..
[01:57:33] <seutje> sacho_, Cork: it doesn't work, it errors out and prevents me from aggregating all my separate files
[01:58:00] <seutje> but if I fix it, it'll start tracking stuff and god knows what else it wasn't doing before
[01:58:12] <Cork> heh true
[01:58:32] <seutje> so I'ma just keep it in its separate file and ignore it until I see a ticket :P
[01:59:09] * seutje puts his blinders back on
[01:59:23] <seutje> or whatever those horse eye-patch thingies are called in english
[01:59:47] <FilipNortic> I think I saw a discusion about disabling elements in here and I tried it but this: http://jsfiddle.net/V9sWH/1/  doen't work for me, anyone know why?
[02:01:14] <seutje> tirengarfio: there's 2 jqueries in there, one is outside the <html> even o.O
[02:01:24] <seutje> tirengarfio: any chance this is a crossdomain call?
[02:03:00] <seutje> FilipNortic: those selectors are all sorts of weird
[02:03:18] <seutje> 'distheselect' makes it look for an element like <distheselect>
[02:03:22] <seutje> prolly meant #distheselect
[02:04:00] <Cork> FilipNortic: http://jsfiddle.net/V9sWH/2/
[02:04:02] <seutje> inside the click handler, 'this' references the element that triggered it, calling closest('select') on it will make it look for a parent element <select>, but it's a sibling
[02:04:10] <sacho_> oh, I see.
[02:04:21] <sacho_> "what do you mean it doesn't work? I installed it just the way they said!" Brilliant.
[02:04:22] <Cork> FilipNortic: the id and siblings not closest
[02:04:54] <seutje> sacho_: this has been in the project way before I got involved, I'm just implementing a responsive redesign :P
[02:06:23] <FilipNortic> ok so I think closet was my real error the id was a copy mistake thanks
[02:07:06] <seutje> yeah I guess its name is a bit confusing
[02:07:13] <seutje> could mean anything, rly
[02:09:04] <Cork> ya it is a short for "closetParent"
[02:09:10] <Cork> but it should prob have had the full name
[02:11:04] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. I have question on performance see this http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[02:12:18] <JustMozzy> on the id based selectors part. if I have two elements inside the ID container. what would be better? first storing the IDd Element in a var and then call find to get the two elements separately or just do the $('#container').find('bla') twice?
[02:28:47] <uskerine> how could I loop through all rows in a datatable?
[02:29:14] <uskerine> I would like to generate a JSON out of the datatables (some columns have <input> and <textareas> and the JSON needs to have only the inner text
[02:36:19] <seutje> uskerine: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/dataTables-1.4/example_form.html
[02:36:46] <seutje> JustMozzy: the former
[02:37:16] <seutje> usually best to cache a selector if you're gonna re-use it
[02:43:58] <JustMozzy> seutje: thanks
[02:44:11] <uskerine> thanks
[02:44:20] <uskerine> seutje i will try it
[02:55:45] <aton`> $('div[id^="tAnswer"]').each(function() { alert(this.text); }); <- why do i get "undefined"?
[02:56:59] <Cork> aton`: $(this).text()
[02:57:06] <Cork> text isn't a property on dom elements
[02:57:17] <Cork> aton`: also use classes when you want to select multiple elements
[02:57:34] <JustMozzy> does appendTo return the to be appended element?
[02:57:40] <Cork> using id^= means you will make the browser loop all the divs in the page
[02:57:46] <aton`> Cork: thank you, will do
[02:57:48] <dave234234> Hello, I'm currently trying to implement jquery validation into my form. It is a test form as I am trying to learn the validation methods. I am stuck and confused as to why my code is not working, I would appreciate it a lot if any of you took a second to look at my code and let me know where im going wrong :) http://jsbin.com/tocazuve/1/edit
[02:57:53] <Cork> JustMozzy: yes
[02:58:24] <JustMozzy> thanks :)
[03:03:30] <aton`> Cork: $('div.answer').each(function() { if ($(this).text()) numanswers++; }); <- works perfectly, thanks
[03:04:30] <Cork> aton`: $('div.answer:empty').length might work for you
[03:06:06] <aton`> that selects just empty divs?
[03:06:19] <aton`> and length is the number of selected items?
[03:06:29] <Cork> exactly
[03:08:15] <aton`> that doesnt select anything
[03:10:14] <aton`> numanswers=$('div.answer:empty').length; alert(numanswers);
[03:11:56] <jimi_> Can someone recommend a method for waiting until a user finishes typing to fire a keyup event?
[03:12:02] <Cork> aton`: is there other child elements in the divs?
[03:12:11] <aton`> Cork: the div is completely empty
[03:12:15] <aton`> <div></div>
[03:13:21] <Cork> aton`: http://jsfiddle.net/65DAw/
[03:13:49] <aton`> jimi_: (re)start a 3 second timer whenever the content changes, when the timer runs out, the user is probably finished
[03:14:55] <Cork> var timer; on('keydown', function() { clearTimeout(timer); timer = setTimeout(update, 5000); });
[03:15:51] <aton`> Cork: okay, i will try to find out why it doesnt work here
[03:15:54] <aton`> i get 0
[03:16:24] <heythere> hey guys if i run this http://jsfiddle.net/EfqAL/ against a demo api that has 2 headers to return a request i won't get any results actually I cant reach data any thoughts?
[03:18:05] <Cork> heythere: bind an error (or fail) handler to the ajax call
[03:18:22] <Cork> also you prob want to check if the browsers prints anything in the browsers console
[03:19:20] <Cork> heythere: also you REALLY shouldn't be using sync ajax calls
[03:19:29] <heythere> well Cork thx for the response, ive tried against a demo api e-g github that doesn't use any headers and it worked, it actually pulled the data out, but when i try to run it with headers on my local api I got the problem that it does 2 requests 1 that sends 0 data and the 2ond that sends the actual data
[03:20:16] <Cork> heythere: the code doesn't run so it is very hard to say what's wrong
[03:20:25] <heythere> what i was trying to do is an ajaxcall to an api and get those data in a csv file
[03:20:32] <Cork> (except for the obvious coding problems)
[03:40:38] <dave452342> Hi i'm tryint to implemeny jquery validation into my tutorial form. unsure why it doesn't seem to be working correctly. I'd very much appreciate it if someone took a look :) http://jsbin.com/tocazuve/1/edit
[03:50:59] <jimi_> aton`, I am trying to do something like this, but the timer fires immediaetly : http://pastie.org/private/nnaz6n7clmvfko98f3aqg
[03:55:53] <xec> jimi_: change  setTimeout(searchDiags(searchTxt), 1000); to  setTimeout(function() { searchDiags(searchTxt); }, 1000);
[03:56:31] <xec> jimi_: the issue is that you're passing the return value of the executed function instead of a function reference
[03:57:55] <jimi_> ha
[03:57:56] <jimi_> whoops
[03:57:58] <jimi_> ty :)
[04:00:07] <Katharsis> is it the right channel to ask about responsive web design?
[04:15:08] <silverdust> I have the following http://jsbin.com/patanaxo/1/
[04:15:28] <silverdust> I get the inline style on the element as I want it
[04:15:47] <silverdust> but I want it to change on screen resize
[04:15:56] <silverdust> I don't know why this isn't working
[04:16:33] <seutje> ur not changing it, ur just unsetting and resetting
[04:17:39] <silverdust> seutje: how can I change it?
[04:17:54] <silverdust> I'm using CSS3 media queries on the element
[04:18:05] <silverdust> and the width/height changes
[04:18:21] <seutje> actually, it's not even unsetting, now it is: http://jsbin.com/patanaxo/2/
[04:18:31] <silverdust> I want it to adapt based on its current width/height
[04:18:39] <seutje> not seeing any media queries here :x
[04:19:24] <silverdust> this is just a small part of the actual code
[04:19:52] <seutje> what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:21:11] <seutje> if u just wanna change the width on resize, just change the width on resize: http://jsbin.com/patanaxo/2/edit
[04:22:25] <silverdust> I'm fetching my width and height from the CSS file
[04:22:35] <seutje> if u wanna use media queries, just use media queries: http://jsbin.com/patanaxo/2/edit
[04:22:44] <seutje> fuck I hate how jsbin updates the current -_-
[04:23:06] <silverdust> I'm making use of a plugin that requires that my .carousel has inline styles
[04:23:22] <seutje> wat?
[04:23:27] <silverdust> I'm handling it fine already with my CSS media queries
[04:24:01] <silverdust> what I want is for the present width and height to become the present inline width and height on each screen width
[04:24:04] <seutje> oh
[04:24:59] <silverdust> solutions?
[04:26:02] <seutje> like that? http://jsbin.com/patanaxo/3/edit
[04:26:56] <silverdust> I think that should work
[04:27:01] <silverdust> thanks seutje
[04:27:05] <seutje> might wanna debounce it though
[04:27:09] <seutje> resize can trigger *a lot*
[04:27:27] <silverdust> I don't get that
[04:27:32] <silverdust> debounce
[04:27:48] <seutje> it's a technique to ensure a function isn't called more than once per x ms
[04:28:08] <seutje> so like if it keeps firing, it won't execute the handler until it stops firing for say... 100ms
[04:28:16] <seutje> `g ben alman debounce
[04:28:17] <b-ot> seutje: Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! → http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[04:28:31] <seutje> decent explanation with visuals there
[04:28:44] <silverdust> ok thanks
[04:29:14] <silverdust> is it ok to have JS variables begin with $ as you have them?
[04:29:26] <silverdust> or you made a mistake as a PHP addict?
[04:29:41] <seutje> I did it on purpose cause it represents a jQuery collection
[04:29:49] <Cork> silverdust: it is ok, but not needed
[04:29:59] <seutje> that way I know I can chain jQuery methods on it, it's just a convention I use
[04:30:03] <Cork> it is up to what style rules you want to have on the site
[04:30:05] <silverdust> ok cool then
[04:30:16] <seutje> I just wanted to cache the selector result
[04:30:46] <seutje> the "var" is pretty necessary though
[04:31:18] <seutje> in your example, the classObject was leaking to the global scope, and not in a way that would be allowed under strict mode
[04:32:00] <seutje> oh lol, just noticed I forgot to use the reference in the callback :x
[04:32:50] <silverdust> what reference?
[04:33:47] <seutje> the classObject = $('.carousel')... should be $carousel
[04:34:41] <silverdust> ok that
[04:45:30] <heythere> so guys I got this code here : http://jsfiddle.net/P7Lx5/ ... am busting my head when i do console.log(data) in the success function it does log the object and everything is fine.. when downloadjson2csv happens the data for some reason is empty in the csv any ideas?
[04:47:07] <Cork> heythere: try with http://jsfiddle.net/P7Lx5/1/
[04:48:19] <seutje> shouldn't that be hoisting?
[04:48:27] <seutje> being named and all
[04:48:40] <Cork> you mean the setHeader function?
[04:48:43] <seutje> yeah
[04:48:52] <Cork> sure that wasn't the main change i did :)
[04:50:15] <heythere> still nothing Cork <:
[04:50:25] <bberry> dont worry #jquery, i'm back
[04:50:51] <heythere> am frustrated over this... i dont get how it works when i do console log but when i am actually to convert the data it doesnt
[04:52:15] <bberry> heythere: have you tried using breakpoints to see whats going on?
[04:53:47] <heythere> not rly bberry never used breakpoints in jquery before
[04:56:26] <bberry> heythere: it could be useful for your scenario.  you can monitor exactly what is happening to any variable you want. You can literally 'step' through the code and determine when changes are made to the data in question
[04:57:06] <heythere> ye am familiar with debugging in general but never done it in js where can i do that kind of debugging? any software or smthing?
[04:57:46] <bberry> yeah, if you're using chrome, you can just hit f12. click the 'sources' tab and you can insert breakpoints
[04:57:54] <bberry> same thing with FF i believe
[04:58:00] <heythere> ah ok thx ye am using chrome
[04:58:09] <heythere> never done debugging to that<: new to web development
[04:58:15] <heythere> and especially jquery stuff
[04:58:32] <heythere> thx for that bberry ill try it out :)
[04:58:35] <bberry> yepyep np
[04:58:50] <seutje> Cork: oooh, I see, you moved the inner doc rdy?
[04:59:04] <seutje> visual diffing is hard
[04:59:07] <Cork> seutje: re(moved) :)
[04:59:14] <Cork> he had two
[04:59:18] <Cork> and a scope
[04:59:22] <seutje> hey, removing is a type of moving!
[04:59:23] <Cork> creating a data variable
[04:59:30] <seutje> just mv  to /dev/null :P
[04:59:33] <Cork> :)
[05:00:07] <seutje> tbh, "re-moving" sort of feels like "moving it again"
[05:00:29] <Cork> heh true
[05:01:20] <Cork> seutje: btw i saw a notice this morning
[05:01:29] <seutje> wasn't me!
[05:01:35] <Cork> they are starting to work on es7
[05:01:41] <Hardeep> hi sir
[05:01:56] <seutje> oh boy
[05:02:16] <Cork> so es6 is getting into stabilize phase!
[05:02:33] <seutje> now we'll have even more ppl going all "you should do x, even though it doesn't work in any browser, yet!"
[05:02:56] <Cork> seutje: well most of harmony actually works in firefox and chrome
[05:03:06] <Cork> you just have to tell it to allow it :)
[05:03:23] <seutje> lol, cli flag isn't really an option for end-users
[05:03:39] <Cork> seutje: didn't mean cli flags
[05:03:53] <seutje> "Hi there, you might be seeing this message because you didn't enable a seemingly obscure feature hidden behind a bunch of warnings! :D"
[05:04:02] <Cork> priviliged js has harmony support
[05:04:17] <Mateo_> Hi ! I was wondering if it’s possible to modify that : http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/selectmenu-custom-filter/ to use data coming from another source, like ajax or json
[05:04:18] <Cork> but ya it isn't possible to use it in pages yet
[05:05:00] <seutje> it's web, it's always least common denominator
[05:05:04] <Mateo_> I’d like to make a select that I can filter with contacts coming from the Phonegap function
[05:06:38] <Cork> seutje: so chrome then :D
[05:06:50] <Cork> for the public web they support one feature ^^'
[05:06:59] <seutje> Cork: haha, did IE8 go away whilst I wasn't looking?
[05:07:12] <seutje> did mobile get their shit together overnight?
[05:07:22] <Cork> http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/ <-- not in the compatibility sheet ^^
[05:07:44] <seutje> even IE10 is all "NOH!"
[05:08:01] <Cork> no
[05:08:07] <silverdust> seutje: I may be seeing why you had asked me to debounce now
[05:08:11] <Cork> ie10 has a long list of things it supports
[05:08:13] <seutje> silverdust: :P
[05:08:40] <silverdust> the current resize values (width/height) are not so accurate
[05:09:03] <silverdust> It gets so fast that I think it picks one before the current viewport
[05:09:24] <silverdust> and it's not perfect
[05:09:32] <seutje> seems unlikely, unless ur already throttling
[05:10:41] <silverdust> I'm just going throught the Ben Alman's article. What I have is still what you gave me
[05:23:40] <K4T> var btn = $('.report-comment-form.cloned .btn-close'); I would like to change it to something like this (for caching): var form = $('.report-comment-form.cloned'); $btn = form.$('.btn-close');
[05:23:53] <K4T> but it looks like it doesnt work
[05:24:05] <K4T> I am not sure if I can do something like that
[05:24:06] <Cork> K4T: s/.$/.find/
[05:56:05] <tpyo> are there known issues with using draggable on images?
[05:56:14] <tpyo> i use it on my div container and the z-index is fine
[05:56:35] <tpyo> but on the img tags within that container and the z-index fails and the images always appear behind the main panel
[05:56:49] <tpyo> i've tried both stack and z-index
[05:56:56] <tpyo> and they don't appear to change anything
[05:57:17] <Cork> tpyo: try setting display: block or inline-block on the image
[05:59:33] <tpyo> alas my woes are not solved
[05:59:50] <tpyo> neither block nor inline-block offer comfort
[06:01:31] <tpyo> its puzzling that this is okay on the parent div :S
[06:02:42] <Cork> tpyo:
[06:02:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8z3TN/opps
[06:02:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8z3TN/
[06:02:53] <Cork> O_o'
[06:03:05] <Cork> that's a first one... delayed paste...
[06:03:48] <tpyo> thanks for the example
[06:04:02] <tpyo> the issue im having is going between divs
[06:04:18] <tpyo> so I have like wrapper -> left | middle | right -> div -> img
[06:04:21] <Cork> ya, anyway i gtg
[06:04:23] <Cork> (sorry)
[06:04:35] <tpyo> and when I go from the right img to the middle the z-index is screwed
[06:24:38] <Mateo_> Hmm. This is probably a simple reason, but why with this : https://gist.github.com/KuneStudio/026e3fb6035ccca4e0f9  , the result in my console is this : listviewcreate / then : after success contact /then : onsuccess contacts
[06:25:06] <tpyo> ah I needed to use helper:clone because the container had an overflow-y setting
[06:25:18] <Mateo_> omg … Nevermind
[06:26:23] <Mateo_> But a problem is still there. Why do I have the dom updated with append <option>, but nothing in the listview :/
[06:28:31] <Mateo_> If i add options manually in the dom they ARE displayed in the list
[06:38:50] <Amnesia> hi question, when I use clone() on button elements that use jqueryui, I manually need to remove multiple classes, e.g: $('.ui-state-focus').removeClass('ui-state-focus'); $('.ui-state-hover').removeClass('ui-state-hover');
[06:39:06] <Amnesia> what's the best practice to clone buttons that use jqueryui?
[06:42:21] <seutje> Amnesia: prolly destroy and re-init
[06:42:51] <Amnesia> hm op
[06:42:54] <Amnesia> s/op/ok
[06:42:56] <Amnesia> ty:)
[06:43:19] <seutje> if possible, might be more interesting to just propagate the click from one button to the other
[06:43:37] <seutje> so instead of making a clone with all the handlers, u just make a fresh one and point it to the other button
[06:43:47] <seutje> but that might not fit into your use-case
[06:43:55] <Amnesia> nope, not really
[06:44:07] <Amnesia> I guess I'll just make a function that reinitializes all of the buttons
[06:44:46] <seutje> why all of them?
[06:45:00] <Amnesia> in the cloned row that is*
[06:45:35] <talanor> Hello, could someone explain me why this selector is invalid : "#lines > div > div:first > select" ? tanks
[06:46:16] <seutje> var $btn = $('.the-button'), $clone = $btn.clone().button('destroy').button($btn.button('options')); or something?
[06:46:28] <seutje> should re-init with the same settings
[06:46:49] <seutje> talanor: it's not invalid afaict
[06:47:27] <Amnesia> seutje: yep, ty
[06:48:05] <talanor> so it should select any element with select tag in the first div element of every div in the element $("#lines") ?
[06:48:37] <seutje> talanor: :first isn't native standard, but for jQuery, that should be valid
[06:49:14] <seutje> suppose you might as well use first-child in this case
[06:52:31] <talanor> aw yes, that makes more sense, i'll give it a try, thanks seutje
[06:54:19] <talanor> hmmmm still no luck
[06:56:22] <talanor> seutje: it works, mb. I just didn't change every selectors in my code, thank you
[07:02:51] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[07:03:02] <Starcraftmazter> i have an issue whereby closest() isnt finding a label above an input
[07:03:33] <Starcraftmazter> closest('label') returns a blank object
[07:03:36] <BillCris_> Starcraftmazter: Is the label a parent or is it above it?
[07:03:47] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: above it
[07:04:06] <BillCris_> Starcraftmazter: So you're want to use .prev() or .prevAll('label');
[07:04:08] <BillCris_> you'd*
[07:04:20] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: really? whats the difference?
[07:04:22] <BillCris_> .closest() is for transversing the parents, not siblings.
[07:05:19] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: not working either, its actually a sibling inside a parent
[07:05:37] <Starcraftmazter> do i need to go up and traverse down?
[07:05:39] <Starcraftmazter> in this situation
[07:06:04] <BillCris_> I believe you want .parent().prev().
[07:06:11] <BillCris_> Posting the HTML would help a lot.
[07:06:30] <BillCris_> I mean, I'd try to make it even more flexible and do like $('input').closest('.container').find('label');
[07:07:30] <BillCris_> .container being a parent even higher up.
[07:13:51] <BillCris_> Starcraftmazter: Did that help?
[07:15:33] <BillCris_> Starcraftmazter: http://jsbin.com/helayecu/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:16:29] <BillCris_> You could even just add the 'focus' class to .field and in the css do .focus .label {} since CSS is good at getting to children, no so much parents.
[07:22:32] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: yep
[07:22:51] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: do you know much about datetimepicker in bootstrap? :P
[07:23:03] <BillCris_> Starcraftmazter: Nope.
[07:24:28] <BillCris_> Starcraftmazter: Does one even exist in Bootstrap or are you just using jQuery UIs?
[07:24:46] <Basile_S> Hello, I am Basile Starynkevitch. I'm working now on the MELT monitor (GPLv3, pre-alpha software). https://github.com/bstarynk/melt-monitor ; there is something I don't understand about dynamically adding tabs.
[07:25:22] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: i believe its coming from bootstrap
[07:25:37] <BillCris_> Can you find documentation for it Starcraftmazter?
[07:26:00] <Starcraftmazter> BillCris_: /module/Application/public/vendor/eonasdan-bootstrap-datetimepicker/src/js/bootstrap-datetimepicker.js
[07:26:22] <Starcraftmazter> https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker
[07:26:25] <BillCris_> Oh, that's not a part of the core bootstrap like I was assuming.
[07:26:30] <Starcraftmazter> yeh
[07:26:32] <Starcraftmazter> hmm
[07:26:35] <BillCris_> Well, I am not familiar with that haha.
[07:26:45] <Starcraftmazter> damnit
[07:27:07] <Basile_S> For reference, I am using Linux/Debian, Firefox30, Jquery2.1.1, jqueryui1.10.4 (i.e. latest things).
[07:30:09] <Basile_S> Q: How to add dynamically a tab? http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation suggests to tabs.find( ".ui-tabs-nav" ), but when statically builing tabs, one have to fill the <ul> part and then the <div>
[07:31:37] <Basile_S> So can I append to the ul, add a div to the tab-div, and call tabs("refresh")?
[07:32:00] <Basile_S> Why and what is the .ui-tab-nav thing?
[07:32:02] <shoky> Basile_S: yes
[07:32:20] <Basile_S> @shoky: yes to what?
[07:32:55] <shoky> Basile_S: yes to <Basile_S> So can I append to the ul, add a div to the tab-div, and call tabs("refresh")?
[07:33:10] <Basile_S> Apparently, according to the browser, the div are updated, but not shown.
[07:33:18] <shoky> Basile_S: ui-tab-nav is the class jquery-ui gives to the nav <ul>
[07:33:52] <Basile_S> FWIW, I just git-commited my code on github.
[07:34:17] <shoky> if something isn't working for you, make a demo jsfiddle
[07:34:47] <Basile_S> I'm a newbie on web development (I'm a compiler guy).
[07:34:59] <shoky> many people are
[07:35:23] <Basile_S> Does anyone know when firebug HTML inspectors shows the HTML ul in light colors, what does that mean?
[07:36:08] <Basile_S> @shoky: do you know of a simple example adding things like I do?
[07:36:20] <shoky> Basile_S: like you do? i have no idea what you're doing
[07:36:33] <shoky> Basile_S: you linked to a simple example of adding tabs
[07:36:49] <Basile_S> Yes, but do I need the ui-tab-nav?
[07:37:12] <shoky> jquery-ui will add that class
[07:38:32] <Basile_S> I see, my div has a display: none, but I have to understand who made that.
[07:38:44] <Basile_S> Does jquery-ui is forcing the display:none?
[07:38:55] <shoky> i don't know what div you're talking about. make a demo
[07:39:14] <shoky> if the div is a tab that's not currently shown, sure, it'll have display:none
[07:39:58] <Basile_S> But how should a new tab be made visible, i.e. be shown? Isn't that the role of tabs("refresh")?
[07:39:58] <dystie> Evening all. if I have a protoype that I want to refer to from outside of it (ie inside a click event, where "this" is the click event), what could I use?       Talking about a Foo.prototype = { methods{} }
[07:42:02] <shoky> Basile_S: no, the role of tabs("refresh") is so the new content you added will be treated as a new tab. if you want to show it you need to set the "active" option too
[07:42:05] <Basile_S> Frow what I'm understanding, show is for the tabs panel, not individual tab?
[07:42:23] <Basile_S> active on the new div tab, or on the whole tabs panel?
[07:43:15] <shoky> the whole tabs widget
[07:43:24] <shoky> that's the only thing you call .tabs(..) on
[07:43:34] <Basile_S> And how do I know the index passed to active?
[07:43:49] <Basile_S> Is there a way to know the index of a given div tab?
[07:44:11] <shoky> .index()  would usually work
[07:44:25] <Basile_S> Thanks. I will try just now!
[07:44:50] <shoky> np
[07:45:42] <shoky> Basile_S: ah also you can set active to -1  which should activate the last tab
[07:46:10] <Basile_S> should I call tabs("option","active",index) before or after tabs("refresh")? I guess after, but I am not sure!
[07:46:18] <shoky> after
[07:46:23] <Basile_S> Thanks.
[07:50:10] <Starcraftmazter> whats usually the convention for getting the element selector inside an event
[07:50:17] <Starcraftmazter> if there is onme
[07:50:34] <BillCriswell> It kind of cheers me up when real programmers need help with web stuff. I always assume it'll come so easy to them.
[07:51:03] <BillCriswell> I mean I'm sure they get it a fuck load faster than me, but still.
[07:51:32] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: You mean you want to do like $('.foo .bar').on('click', function() { // Get the '.foo .bar' }); ?
[07:51:45] <Starcraftmazter> its ok i think i got it
[07:52:00] <BillCriswell> Starcraftmazter: Should hopefully not need to do that? haha
[07:52:41] <Basile_S> @shoky. Thanks for the help! Bye...
[07:53:37] <Basile_S> Oh, not bye yet.
[07:53:43] <Basile_S> I've got another question.
[07:54:00] <Basile_S> How can I make a "contextual menu" using jqueryui menu widget?
[07:55:28] <wild_oscar> I'm trying to debug a jquery issue, perhaps you can help me with a preliminary question: how can you check the request parameters on a javascript form submit that outputs a file stream? I was trying firebug's NET tab, but it doesn't display the request in this case
[07:56:45] <Basile_S> My question is similar to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24024842/jquery-easyui-contextual-menu-not-shown but I gave up jeasyui and I am going back to jqueryui.
[07:57:37] <Basile_S> So, let's assume I have some nested <span> tags (e.g. representing some abstract syntax tree, for example for arithmetic expressions)
[07:58:08] <Basile_S> I want to have a meny displayed when I right clik inside one of such nested <span>
[07:58:33] <Basile_S> I'm already able to get feedback (e.g. underline the currently nested span in which I'm clicking).
[07:59:06] <Basile_S> But I am not sure to be able to get a contextmenu replacement
[08:04:05] <shoky> Basile_S: http://jsfiddle.net/9fjvw/
[08:04:42] <Basile_S> @shoky: a big thanks!
[08:05:12] <shoky> yw
[08:05:29] <Basile_S> BTW, what is the meaning of ARIA in jquery docs? Wikipedia speaks of music, but I don't see the relation. (I am not a native English speaker, so bear with me!)
[08:06:39] <Basile_S> @shoky: What is making the menu invisible (unless I right-click)?
[08:06:43] <decx> the contextmenu event is jqui specific?
[08:06:57] <shoky> Basile_S: it's accessibility stuff.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA
[08:07:04] <Basile_S> @shoky: thanks
[08:07:04] <shoky> decx: don't think so
[08:07:15] <shoky> Basile_S:  display:none in the css
[08:07:33] <Basile_S> You don't use .menu() in your code?
[08:07:41] <shoky> first line
[08:07:52] <Basile_S> sorry:!
[08:07:54] <shoky> ;p
[08:07:58] <decx> ah right it's not. not that i'd ever use it :>
[08:08:30] <Basile_S> but isn't menu() supposed to hide the menu by default? Do I have to explictly display:none in the CSS?
[08:09:19] <shoky> Basile_S: yep, it doesn't hide by default
[08:09:24] <Basile_S> Thanks!
[08:11:08] <Basile_S> One more thing. I'll probably put the menu in the initial HTML document (the one loaded at start). Does it matters where I am putting it there?
[08:11:28] <Basile_S> Should I (or not) put it *inside* the tab-panel using it?
[08:13:51] <shoky> it only matters with regards to the positioning.. e.g. if you leave it absolute like in my fiddle, then the left/top is relative to the menu's "offset parent" element (its closest ancestor with position set)
[08:14:16] <shoky> so it's better not to put it inside stuff really ;p
[08:14:26] <shoky> but depends
[08:15:21] <shoky> or if you do put it inside, you'd probably need to change how its positioned
[08:16:24] <shoky> oh but if you only want it to appear inside the tab then it's ok to put it inside
[08:16:34] <Basile_S> Ok. I have already some menus.
[08:16:44] <Basile_S> Will put the new one after the others
[08:18:28] <adsisco> how do i create drop-down menu in jquery mobile? the closest widget i found is the select menu, but it doesn't redirect on change
[08:22:34] <heythere> anyone checked that thing http://www.playfuljs.com/demos/raycaster/
[08:22:51] <heythere> 100 lines of code to run it in js
[08:24:21] <Starcraftmazter> holy crap
[08:24:22] <Starcraftmazter> guys
[08:24:29] <Starcraftmazter> middle click in firefox, does not register as a click event
[08:24:32] <Starcraftmazter> i kid you not
[08:25:20] <heythere> woah are u seriouzzzzzz naw?
[08:26:47] <kylerivers> ph88:  are you there?
[08:27:03] <heythere> yesd
[08:27:06] <Starcraftmazter> wait so
[08:27:13] <Starcraftmazter> you should never use onclick and use mouseup instead?
[08:27:19] <Basile_S> another question: does jquery selectors work on the current state of the document, or on all the future states. In other words, if I install some event handler on some class, would that event be automagically installed on every *future* elements (Ajaxly created) of that class?
[08:28:19] <decx> i read through it yesterday heythere but as with the landscape in 100lines it doesn't click yet, one day
[08:28:31] <NoiseEee> Basile_S: if you use 'event delegation', ie: you tell a common parent to react when something happens to a child of a certain class
[08:29:31] <Basile_S> Is that related to bubble event?
[08:29:35] <heythere> decx: am pretty sure ive seen some unity stuff for it and yes as you said one day we will be playing world of warcraft on a web browser...
[08:30:06] <adsisco> how do i create drop-down menu in jquery mobile? the closest widget i found is the select menu, but it doesn't redirect on change
[08:30:18] <decx> heythere i mean: one day i will finally understand it
[08:30:22] <NoiseEee> Basile_S: yes
[08:30:36] <heythere> decx: hahah ye true a lot of peole working on that already thoguht its nuts
[08:30:58] <decx> and this is a 20 year old technique
[08:31:08] <heythere> yes yes yes:)
[08:31:13] <heythere> well i saw opengl in JS
[08:31:22] <heythere> cray cray stufffffffffffffffffff
[08:31:22] <NoiseEee> Basile_S: so you've clicked on the new item with the class 'clickme', it bubbles up to parents, and whenever a parent's event handler says 'do something when a .clickme is clicked' the handler fires
[08:31:40] <decx> i tried to edit a shader fragment in a webgl demo and burned the house down
[08:32:26] <slax0r> decx: yeah, that's a nasty bug in webgl
[08:32:32] <Basile_S> all this reminds me of the X11 events...
[08:32:35] <heythere> hah well am trying stuff on unity as we speak but its faaaarrrrrr offff that maybe we can base on that first person JS thing and i dunno ok you cant click atm, but i am sure you can take a vector of where the mouse is at
[08:32:42] <heythere> and have a fire button or something
[08:33:12] <aabaaabe> how can i use .find() to get the found element's id?
[08:33:42] <heythere> find().id?
[08:33:44] <shoky> .find(...).prop('id')
[08:34:12] <aabaaabe> $(this).find('classname').id; doesn't work. i'll try with .prop
[08:34:26] <Starcraftmazter> wow my mind has been blown
[08:34:35] <Starcraftmazter> so you should never really use click()  is that right?
[08:34:42] <Starcraftmazter> because it will never work for middle mouse buttons
[08:34:58] <NoiseEee> Starcraftmazter: you should be using 'on'
[08:35:36] <Starcraftmazter> NoiseEee: thats irrelevant
[08:35:46] <Starcraftmazter> im saying, you should always be using the mouseup event rather than the click event
[08:36:00] <heythere> on('click'
[08:36:19] <decx> you can use mouseup if you like unbearable delays
[08:36:23] <decx> mousedown all the way
[08:36:26] <NoiseEee> Starcraftmazter: i guess it depends on what you're after
[08:36:37] <heythere> you should always... doesnt work with my vocabulary... there is no ALWAYS! we all die :d
[08:36:47] <NoiseEee> Starcraftmazter: you can always use something.on('click touchstart somethingelse',function() {}_
[08:36:47] <Starcraftmazter> well if you have any link or button, and the user wants to middle click it to open in a new tab, click action wont work
[08:37:17] <shoky> good
[08:37:55] <Starcraftmazter> whats touchstart, is that for mobile ?
[08:38:01] <aabaaabe> var tooltip = $(this).find('tooltip'); alert(tooltip.id); returns undefined
[08:38:13] <shoky> aabaaabe:  .prop('id')
[08:38:22] <shoky> aabaaabe:  .find('tooltip') looks for <tooltip> elements
[08:38:38] <shoky> and don't use alert for debugging
[08:38:47] <heythere> console.log
[08:39:10] <aabaaabe> shoky: so .find('tooltip').prop('id'); ?
[08:39:12] <NoiseEee> Starcraftmazter: yes
[08:39:15] <shoky> aabaaabe: no.
[08:39:30] <shoky> aabaaabe: unless.. you're really looking for a <tooltip> element?
[08:40:31] <aabaaabe> shoky: i just want the id
[08:40:37] <Starcraftmazter> does e.preventDefault() not work with mouseDown?
[08:40:49] <shoky> aabaaabe: the id of a <tooltip> element?
[08:40:54] <aabaaabe> yes.
[08:41:02] <shoky> then that's how.
[08:41:04] <aabaaabe> tooltip is a div inside of the parent
[08:41:12] <shoky> so it's a <div> not a <tooltip> :\
[08:41:19] <shoky> then don't search for <tooltip>
[08:41:20] <aabaaabe> right the class name is tooltip
[08:41:24] <decx> what's button and buttons in the mousedown event?
[08:41:26] <shoky> then use a class selector
[08:42:48] <aabaaabe> shoky: working. ty
[08:43:09] <Starcraftmazter> if you use click mousedown together, will it not double up?
[08:43:18] <Starcraftmazter> on the normal click
[08:47:17] <shoky> decx: buttons is FF only it seems
[08:48:40] <Starcraftmazter> damnit t does
[08:48:41] <decx> and button is the only way to get it in ie<9
[08:48:44] <Starcraftmazter> so i cant do click mousedown
[08:49:14] <NoiseEee> Starcraftmazter: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795734/triggering-onclick-event-using-middle-click
[08:49:17] <decx> ie<9 lmb 1, mmb 4, rmb 2
[08:51:48] <moskiteau> anyone can recommend me a widget/plugin for elasticsearch faceted search that support search, pagination, facets, sorting ?
[08:52:40] <decx> i dont think you'll find a single widget for that. faceted search is big business
[08:53:20] <moskiteau> it's not that complex either, i don't get it why it doesnt exist
[08:56:21] <decx> well i guess you'll have to start one yourself
[08:58:17] <duch_kazatel> getting approved for my api access request this morning makes me stupid happy.
[08:58:40] <decx> is it a sex api?
[08:59:01] <duch_kazatel> that would be even better.  but nope :(
[08:59:04] <duch_kazatel> untappd
[08:59:23] <BillCriswell> The beer thing?
[08:59:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[08:59:27] <duch_kazatel> for kegbot
[08:59:31] <BillCriswell> Haha nice.
[08:59:47] <BillCriswell> What will that do? Let you know when a keg is low?
[08:59:53] <decx> untappd, hehe that could be the name of a sex api
[09:00:02] <decx> like a dating site or something
[09:00:07] <duch_kazatel> auto checkin drinks for people.
[09:00:13] <decx> nobody's tapping this guy <-
[09:05:05] <duch_kazatel> you'd think i would have figured out this whole "s3 security policy" thing by now.
[09:05:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I know shit about anything server related. definitely my weakest point as a developer.
[09:06:06] <decx> i started putty once, so there's that
[09:06:27] <puchacz> hi, when I use iframe, do I *have* to put there a full html document, i.e. with <html>, <body> etc.?
[09:06:34] <puchacz> or a simple div is enough?
[09:06:55] <decx> your browser will figure it out, but don't expect it to be valid
[09:06:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha. Yeah, I did too. It was only with a very detailed list of things to do from the server guy though.
[09:06:56] <puchacz> also, can I make iframe inherit css from main window (yes, in this case I want it)
[09:07:17] <duch_kazatel> puchacz the browser can try to figure it out, but it technically should be a full, valid document.
[09:07:21] <duch_kazatel> and css can't inherit.,
[09:07:29] <puchacz> duch_kazatel, decx: ok, thx
[09:07:41] <puchacz> I will follow specs
[09:07:54] <puchacz> so full doc and repeated css
[09:08:07] <duch_kazatel> puchacz what are you using an iframe for?
[09:09:44] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: the only reason in this use case is rangy - I don't know how to make it pick selections for specific divs only
[09:09:54] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[09:09:59] <duch_kazatel> make what pick what?
[09:10:14] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: you may remember I was enquirying few days ago about iframe for external document, but it is different use case
[09:10:38] <adsisco> i have a select menu that redirects on change, however, the option goes back to default on new page load, how can i make the select menu remember the previous selection?
[09:10:39] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: rangy is a library that can work with selections: http://code.google.com/p/rangy/wiki/RangyObject
[09:10:47] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:10:57] <NoiseEee> puchacz: an iframe is a separate document with its own <html></html>
[09:11:05] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: there is a method called rangy.getSelection([Window win])
[09:11:13] <puchacz> NoiseEee: ok, I will follow the specs
[09:11:20] <duch_kazatel> it sounds liek what you really need is some kind of server-side include or similar setup, not an iframe.
[09:11:30] <duch_kazatel> but i don't know what you're doing so it's hard to say :)
[09:11:59] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: for this use case I don't really need anything special, just a div would do. but the pesky rangy cannot be pointed to a div
[09:12:10] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: if I go for iframe, I feel I am doing it wrong way
[09:12:11] <duch_kazatel> okay
[09:12:48] <duch_kazatel> btw rangy is officially on github now, not google code.

[09:13:32] <duch_kazatel> thank you shoky
[09:13:38] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: ah, thx. I will check, maybe there is newer version. and what am I doing? I let a user select something and then server can process it
[09:13:59] <puchacz> the thing is that I want them to operate on specific fragment (div in this case) only....
[09:14:38] <NoiseEee> puchacz: you can certainly get to elements in the iframe from the parent
[09:15:04] <kegster> omg i am so sorry guys
[09:15:12] <puchacz> NoiseEee: I know, I did the iframe setup for external documents, this is what iframe is for.
[09:15:18] <shoky> its ok kegster we still <3 u
[09:15:24] <kegster> i meant to paste an IP that was an alt tag in an image, and it copied the whole block on chrome dev lol
[09:15:37] <kegster> i didnt even hit enter. xchat sends it for me i guess lmao
[09:15:39] <puchacz> NoiseEee: now I wanted similar setup for internal documents, which can live in a div, not iframe
[09:15:51] <duch_kazatel> kegster newlines lol
[09:15:59] <duch_kazatel> it's ok, i do the same thing sometimes with chat logs.
[09:16:34] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: am I to download zip from this?
[09:16:35] <puchacz> https://github.com/jackcviers/Rangy
[09:17:16] <duch_kazatel> puchacz the official repo is linked from the google code page you sent earlier -> https://github.com/timdown/rangy
[09:17:37] <puchacz> thx
[09:20:03] <puchacz> right, still it seems there is no way to make it pick selections from specific divs only....
[09:21:19] <antlong> anyone interested in working on an open source game? www.multiverseminer.com
[09:33:56] <chriys> hey guys I'm looking to get some certifications in web design HTML5, JQUERY and PHP. do you some free of them or the cheaper one?
[09:34:20] <duch_kazatel> chriys i wouldn't waste your time with certs.
[09:34:44] <chriys> lolll it's because I want a better job and I have no diploma
[09:34:46] <Basile_S> @chriys: I don't know about certs. But I would suggest you to contribute to some free software. It is always valuable on your résumé.
[09:35:45] <Basile_S> I also believe that getting some diploma is valuable (but I could be wrong).
[09:36:08] <duch_kazatel> a diploma or experience.
[09:36:11] <duch_kazatel> or both.
[09:36:21] <duch_kazatel> certs are mostly useless.
[09:36:25] <NoiseEee> ^^
[09:36:28] <NoiseEee> s/mostly//
[09:36:54] <duch_kazatel> i mean, if you find value in them, whatever, but employers won't
[09:37:01] <NoiseEee> they're a great way for organizations to make money 'teaching' people or testing people, but have little value to employers
[09:37:49] <duch_kazatel> chriys i don't have a diploma either, and i'm making great money.
[09:38:12] <chriys> Basile_S: If I hav two website on my portefolio does this help for getting a job I also have a good portefolio in graphic design
[09:38:55] <Basile_S> @chriys: I have no idea on that subject (I'm French, and I've got a PhD, and I'm working in the public sector)
[09:39:06] <duch_kazatel> chriys where in the world are you?
[09:39:15] <chriys> duch_kazatel: Montreal
[09:39:45] <duch_kazatel> all right, so you need a strong portfolio and demonstrable skills.  how much experience do you have?
[09:39:46] <Basile_S> However, I've met many persons which worked on real free software projects (GCC for example) and got a valuable job on it.
[09:42:07] <derrida> is there a good way to have a tap anywhere on screen result in focusing an inputField that might be offscreen?
[09:44:05] <chriys> I have 2 websites, 15 posters, 3 DVD packages and 4 logos on portefolio and 3 years of experience almost 4. My skills are Photoshop, illustrator, Dreamweaver (honestly I use sublime cause Dw is crap), HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, PHP, Linux I can work on both Mac and Windows
[09:44:37] <chriys> that's my experience duch_kazatel
[09:44:56] <duch_kazatel> chriys switch to using sublime full time.  what about javascript - any experience using JUST that without jquery?
[09:46:21] <decx> there are thousands of people with portfolios like that, recruiters don't give a shit. build something cool, publish it somewhere reddit/hn and then people will come to you
[09:46:26] <derrida> At the end of the day, if you're good, you get hired, if you're not good, no amount of experience, acumen, or bulk of work really matters.
[09:46:29] <Basile_S> @chriys: reading http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ and studying Scheme will teach you a lot and improve your coding skills.
[09:46:38] <duch_kazatel> decx that's one way to do it :)
[09:47:03] <duch_kazatel> derrida or you can bullshit well and sell yourself without the skills, or the opposite - have skills but doubt yourself too much.
[09:47:11] <duch_kazatel> it's a balance.  best way to find out is to start applying to places.
[09:47:16] <chriys> I'm quite confortable with js but I prefer JQuery it's faster and I mostly use Jquery than JS this doesn't mean that I don't understand pure JS
[09:47:16] <Basile_S> Scheme is semantically quite similar to JavaScript.
[09:47:21] <derrida> duch_kazatel: that will only work for so long
[09:47:29] <derrida> not a sustainable way
[09:47:54] <duch_kazatel> derrida depends on who it is :) i've known some people who make 6 figure salaries and they know very little.  depends on the company.
[09:47:54] <chriys> duch_kazatel: I use sublime in full time since 2 months
[09:47:55] <decx> so long before you get promoted to management
[09:48:25] <duch_kazatel> chriys yeah start applying around and see what kind of feedback you get.
[09:48:45] <derrida> duch_kazatel: I guess it depends on what you're doing, as a software engineer- I find it hard to imagine that flying for very long.
[09:48:56] <chriys> duch_kazatel: what will be my chances?
[09:49:24] <duch_kazatel> "chances"?
[09:49:29] <duch_kazatel> of what, finding a job?
[09:49:49] <duch_kazatel> dunno - there's a lot more to it than just a portfolio.  culture fit is becoming important at a lot of places.
[09:49:58] <chriys> duch_kazatel: yep the probabilities to get something starting at 35K/year (CDN)
[09:50:12] <chriys> don't forget no diploma on hand
[09:50:37] <duch_kazatel> i don't know very much about the canadian job market, but i was making 10k more than a year with my first real developer gig.
[09:50:43] <duch_kazatel> *more than that
[09:51:23] <duch_kazatel> the great thing about applications is you might get some decent feedback.  if you keep hearing the same things over and over, you'll know what you need to change or work on.
[09:54:13] <guzzlefry> hm
[09:54:29] <guzzlefry> how would I call a jquery function on a parent frame from the child?
[09:54:42] <duch_kazatel> O.O
[09:54:49] <Basile_S> @chriys: your contextmenu thing work, but I can't find its documentation. Is it a jquery thing or a DOM/Javascript one?
[09:55:22] <chriys> duch_kazatel: I see thanks for the advice
[09:55:40] <chriys> Basile_S: what are you talking about
[09:55:55] <Cyclohexane> How can I do .not(':nth-last-child(2)')? I get: unrecognized expression: nth-last-child
[09:56:33] <Basile_S> Sorry, that was not @chriys but @shoky
[09:56:40] <chriys> loll ok
[09:56:55] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: why the funny eyes? :P
[09:56:59] <donmatthew> hi, I'm having a problem with colorbox plugin.. Each time I press next/prev button it's supposed to change picture, but it's not respending on every click I do.
[09:57:17] <donmatthew> someone knows this plugin?
[09:57:29] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ donmatthew
[09:57:29] <b-ot> donmatthew: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:58:32] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry there's a parent javascript object, but i usually caution against doing that.
[09:58:41] <Mateo_> I’m using a custom select filter in my form (in a “Add” page), but when I select a value in the select, I’m redirected to the previous page (the home, where the Add button is)
[09:58:50] <Mateo_> The code I’m using is the one in the demo : http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/selectmenu-custom-filter/#&ui-state=dialog
[09:59:21] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/gev2VTq3
[09:59:26] <donmatthew> here's "my code"
[09:59:27] <decx> Cyclohexane what jquery version?
[09:59:32] <donmatthew> applying to colorbox stuff
[10:00:01] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew is it at all possible for you to set this up using jsfiddle and get it working?
[10:00:03] <Cyclohexane> decx: v1.7.2
[10:00:21] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: api is on my localhost
[10:00:32] <guzzlefry> what about having a form in the iframe submit as if it were in the parent? The issue is that WHMCS is in an iframe, and when redirected to paypal, well, it doesn't work.
[10:00:42] <decx> there you go, use the version where that is actually implemented Cyclohexane
[10:00:44] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew you should be able to share your rendered markup, but OK.
[10:01:26] <Cyclohexane> decx: lol, i missed the small print "version added"
[10:01:43] <decx> ^^
[10:01:47] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew you have a lot of repeat code going on here.
[10:01:54] <donmatthew> yup
[10:01:55] <donmatthew> :D
[10:02:12] <duch_kazatel> so what particular part are you having problems with then?
[10:03:07] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: that's what I can't find out.. It's the colorbox plugin itself.. Everytime the gallery is at its end or in the beginning, and should start over.. I need to click twice on the next/prev button
[10:03:28] <donmatthew> or maybe if my custom js creates that problem
[10:04:07] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew without seeing your markup it's hard to say.
[10:05:32] <guzzlefry> looks like $/jQuery on the parent are restricted for some reason? They're red in Firebug's listing.
[10:05:57] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew i'll bet your bindings are broken.
[10:06:41] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: probably
[10:06:50] <donmatthew> let me check if I remove my custom js file
[10:07:15] <Mateo_> If you want to see more of my code, here is a fiddle (that doesn’t work due to an unknown reason ^^)
[10:08:23] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: no difference.. seems to be the colorbox plugin itself
[10:08:26] <decx> what a cliffhanger
[10:08:36] <donmatthew> when I'm at "the first image" and clicking on either prev/next nothing happens
[10:08:50] <donmatthew> in the gallery
[10:09:29] <duch_kazatel> i have a hard time believing a popular plugin for jquery is bugged, donmatthew
[10:09:48] <duch_kazatel> at least, with something that big.
[10:10:02] <Mateo_> http://jsfiddle.net/Bme9n/
[10:11:21] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew strip_tags :(
[10:12:01] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: something I found.. im a php developer
[10:12:04] <donmatthew> not used to this stuff
[10:12:09] <donmatthew> got any better idea? :D
[10:12:17] <duch_kazatel> don't parse html with regular expressions.
[10:12:58] <donmatthew> how?
[10:15:17] <PerlWebDev> plenty of parsers for html that let you walk the DOM
[10:21:45] <Cyclohexane> How do I select the second to last element?
[10:22:01] <duch_kazatel> use .length - 1 and then .get() that one.
[10:22:04] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: lol, now it seems to work after I added a transition to the colorbox.
[10:22:06] <duch_kazatel> err, wait.
[10:22:23] <donmatthew> weird
[10:22:26] <duch_kazatel> Cyclohexane "second to last element" of the collect?  or the current children?
[10:23:41] <Cyclohexane> duch_kazatel: of the collect e.g. $('.msg') == [ <div class="msg"></div>, <div class"=msg" ... </div> ]
[10:24:31] <shoky> .eq(-2)
[10:24:38] <duch_kazatel> yeah i just remembered that one.
[10:24:45] <duch_kazatel> .eq() can take negative values.
[10:26:22] <Cyclohexane> shoky: duch_kazatel: sweet thanks
[10:26:49] <decx> didnt you want to select everything but the second to last earlier
[10:27:27] <Mateo_> OOooook, now the fiddle is working, with the same problem I have on my app ! :)
[10:27:29] <Mateo_> http://jsfiddle.net/Bme9n/1/
[10:27:40] <Mateo_> If anyone wants to take a little look ...
[10:27:47] <naeluh_humpday> hows everybody doing !
[10:28:50] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ you're adding a bunch of extra bindings you don't need.
[10:29:21] <duch_kazatel> like line 28/29.  every time "#home" shows, you're binding again.  remove that extra handler and just bind.
[10:29:23] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel : like wich one ?
[10:29:38] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: ok
[10:29:45] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'll wind up binding the same thing over and over and over.
[10:31:45] <decx> is there something to access the full collection inside filter()
[10:32:52] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: thanks for your advice :) and about the “return home” problem ? any idea ?
[10:33:07] <duch_kazatel> start with my suggestion - i'll bet that's where your headaches start.
[10:36:24] <decx> matt cutts going all out with the special effects on the new google webmasters youtube video
[10:37:29] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: I’ve put all the bindings in the startApp()
[10:44:45] <islalobo> Hello, good afternoon
[10:45:12] <islalobo> I am trying to get a sticky menu to work; trying to get a menu that floats with the user as they scroll
[10:45:26] <islalobo> I was using this tutorial: http://www.benmarshall.me/jquery-sticky-navigation/
[10:48:29] <decx> and?
[10:57:58] <decx> AND?
[10:58:18] <BillCriswell> AAANNDDDDDD
[10:58:33] <BillCriswell> Don't leave me in suspense PLEEASEEE
[10:59:06] <decx> right
[10:59:10] <decx> dem cliffhangers
[11:00:34] <rook2pawn> i am calling $.ajax({url:'http://someurl.com/foo'},type:'POST'}) and the call is instead going to the current URL
[11:01:48] <islalobo> decx: sorry - was figuring it out
[11:02:00] <islalobo> And then I figured it out
[11:02:23] <rook2pawn> this is for both jquery 1.11.1 and 2.1.1
[11:03:55] <duch_kazatel> rook2pawn you want $.ajax({url:'http://someurl.com/foo', type:'POST'})
[11:03:56] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax('http://someurl.com/foo', {type:'POST'})
[11:04:14] <duch_kazatel> woops multiline - you get the iea.  one of those two.  what you have is invalid js.
[11:31:58] <ezio> i'm using extend and in my creation method i'm doing this which is probably not good ... $context.find('.scan_button').click(function () {
[11:32:19] <ezio> when scan button gets clicked it returns the contexts of all my objects
[11:41:49] <haemly> How can I use the keyup event, using jquery on. So like: $(selector).on("keyup", "#id", function(){}
[11:42:22] <puchacz> I don't understand z-index (they are used to make non-clickable gui with spinners)
[11:42:43] <duch_kazatel> haemly just like what you did there...
[11:42:49] <duch_kazatel> puchacz what do you need to know?
[11:42:51] <haemly> hmm
[11:42:54] <haemly> Wasnt working
[11:43:39] <duch_kazatel> haemly does the selector exist at time of binding?
[11:43:46] <duch_kazatel> and is #id an input?
[11:43:57] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: if I have a toolbar with buttons that I want to block with spinner, and then open jquery dialog that blocks everything with its own overlay and z-index, will it work? ie. will the jquery dialog be above my blocked toolbar?
[11:44:06] <haemly> it was working, not recognizing the keyCode however
[11:44:08] <puchacz> I tried it and it seemed hit and miss
[11:44:34] <puchacz> is z-index absolute number across whole document?
[11:44:38] <puchacz> or somehow parent is consulted?
[11:44:51] <duch_kazatel> puchacz you mean you want to create an overlay? and it depends on the browser ;)
[11:44:54] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:45:08] <haemly> nvm resolved
[11:45:29] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: I will try to make jsfiddle
[11:45:34] <axilla> how would i split 50% 50% on the space once grabbing the first number and once grabbing the second?
[11:45:39] <puchacz> to make it more specific
[11:45:40] <axilla> or 50px 50px
[11:45:43] <haemly> One more question, are you able to pass in multiple event handlers so, $(selector).on("keyup", "dblclick", etc)
[11:53:04] <skinux> How do we access post data?
[11:57:36] <Ownix> When I try to do a hihglight effect, I get a "hide" efect http://jsfiddle.net/HnLcH/
[11:57:43] <Ownix> I cant figure out why it just wont highlight
[12:00:52] <aabaaabe> so i have a 1d array filled with things. I want to add another value into each cell, so i have an array like: [(1,2), (3, 4)] how do?
[12:01:35] <naeluh_humpday> yo whats the good workd
[12:01:38] <naeluh_humpday> word
[12:01:40] <naeluh_humpday> *
[12:04:44] <BillCriswell> aabaaabe: So you want an array or arrays?
[12:04:57] <donmatthew> hi guys
[12:05:36] <donmatthew> at my localhost everything works well when I use append(), but not on my dev machine.. What can be wrong? I get all data that's necessary.. checked by console.log()
[12:05:41] <aabaaabe> BillCriswell: yes.
[12:06:03] <BillCriswell> $.map([1,3], function(n){ return [n, n + 1]; }); should do it.
[12:07:17] <aabaaabe> BillCriswell: ty
[12:09:01] <BillCriswell> Hm, $.map([1,3], function(n){ return [n, n + 1]; }); and [1,3].map(function(n){ return [n, n + 1]; }); aren't retuning the same thing.
[12:09:20] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: are you around? http://jsfiddle.net/8ye7w/14/
[12:09:22] <puchacz> got this fiddle
[12:09:39] <puchacz> if you drag the dialog over blocked toolbar, it behaves the way I wanted it to
[12:09:40] <puchacz> but
[12:09:56] <puchacz> if I remove z-index from toolbar markup, the spinner goes above the dialog
[12:10:15] <puchacz> I don't understand causes and effects here
[12:10:24] <puchacz> and I prefer things to work by design, not by accident :-)
[12:14:03] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: when I inspect the spinner div in chrome, it has huge z-index, but it still is overlaid by dialog
[12:18:12] <freebird2> hi, I need to add a multiselect with a jquery button, I'm trying this already for over 1 day, and no success at all, http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/1/
[12:18:20] <freebird2> any help is welcome
[12:28:09] <nitrospectide> I have this simple callback function on a click that should set a class on an element up a few levels in the DOM that is a div with class "views-row". I'm still a jQuery noob, so I'm not sure why this isn't working. : http://pastie.org/9258908
[12:30:50] <duch_kazatel> wooooo
[12:32:07] <Technodrome> hey guys
[12:32:23] <Technodrome> i have a block of html, a form, i need to post to this form via ajax on another page
[12:32:29] <Technodrome> but i dont want to build the form over again with jquery
[12:33:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:33:34] <Technodrome> like its a pretty big form, 25 or so elements
[12:33:42] <NoiseEee> Technodrome: you don't have to rebuild anything
[12:33:44] <duch_kazatel> what are you building?
[12:35:37] <Azrael_-> hi
[12:35:57] <Technodrome> i have a form, a block of html (not shown to the user) i want to post it when a button is clicked on the site
[12:36:03] <Technodrome> its posting to a remote site
[12:36:13] <Technodrome> i know how to do this with an ajax post pretty easily
[12:36:16] <duch_kazatel> what part of that has to do with rebuilding HTML?
[12:36:22] <Technodrome> but i always add the data attributes etc manually
[12:36:31] <Technodrome> i have a block of html
[12:37:12] <Technodrome> a bit hard to explain i guess
[12:37:27] <duch_kazatel> apparently.  none of what you've described requires you to rebuild anything.
[12:40:22] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: how would you execute a form that is not shown to the user?
[12:41:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd add it to the DOM and set it to display: none;
[12:41:36] <angelryu> which is better, jQuery or bootstrap?
[12:41:45] <duch_kazatel> angelryu bootstrap uses jquery.
[12:41:52] <duch_kazatel> they have different purposes.
[12:42:23] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: that is a solution, then use js to execute it when they click the button
[12:42:30] <angelryu> yes, i'm learning jquery, tho i want to know what's bootstrap used for
[12:42:35] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome submit it, yeah.  you could do that.
[12:42:43] <Technodrome> but is there a way to do it , so its not in the html at all, or in the dom , so like kept as a string or something in javascript?
[12:42:54] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome you don't want a form at that point.
[12:42:59] <duch_kazatel> you can post using ajax
[12:43:02] <Technodrome> yeah
[12:43:04] <Technodrome> thats what i meant
[12:43:14] <Technodrome> but its sorta a big form and i didn’t want to recreate it in code :P
[12:43:15] <duch_kazatel> angelryu bootstrap is a bunch of prebuild UI controls and styles and stuff.
[12:43:29] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome do it the right wya.
[12:43:32] <duch_kazatel> *way
[12:43:39] <freebird2> you guys, many multiselect wont work, can someone give it a look : http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/7/
[12:43:44] <Technodrome> can i serialize the html into javascript
[12:44:01] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome you can serialize a form, sure, but that's not a good solution in your case.
[12:44:08] <Technodrome> hmm
[12:44:25] <angelryu> serialize is for forms, yeah
[12:44:47] <angelryu> serialize is to get ajax data right ?
[12:44:51] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:45:12] <axilla> hi all, i have a varialbe start.x that is a pixel location.. i'd like to convert that to a % before I set it..
[12:45:16] <axilla> how can I do this/
[12:45:44] <duch_kazatel> angelryu just serializes it into data.  what happens after that is up to you.
[12:45:48] <duch_kazatel> axilla a % of what?
[12:46:15] <axilla> i have an x/y coordinate in px
[12:46:19] <axilla> i want to convert it to %
[12:46:22] <duch_kazatel> % of what?
[12:46:24] <duch_kazatel> that
[12:46:31] <duch_kazatel> *that's an ephemeral concept.
[12:46:59] <carpediembaby> Hello, I am trying to bind an event when an option is selected using jquery like so: $(".files").selected(function (data) { ... }) However i get a TypeError undefined is not a function. Even though i verified that $(".files") returns me all the select boxes in the document. What am i doing wrong?
[12:47:04] <duch_kazatel> for something to be converted into a percent, you need to have the number, and the min/max values
[12:47:21] <axilla> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5d757e59421549bfa77f
[12:47:32] <duch_kazatel> carpediembaby .selected() isn't a function
[12:47:39] <duch_kazatel> carpediembaby you mean when you, say, check a box?
[12:48:04] <carpediembaby> duch_kazatel: when an option from a dropdown is selected
[12:48:10] <duch_kazatel> axilla great - what's the range i'm comparing to?  the viewport?
[12:48:15] <axilla> whats happening is i have a div with a background image inside of another div that can be positioned and the coordinates saved into our DB.. i want to save them as a % so that the positioned image fits properly in all views.
[12:48:18] <duch_kazatel> carpediembaby you want .on('change', function(){});
[12:48:19] <axilla> instead of a fixed PX
[12:48:27] <axilla> duch_kazatel: the width of the parent div.
[12:51:21] <duch_kazatel> axilla there are a lot of basic math tutorials on how to get a percentage - you just need the width of the parent container and use that with the number you have to calculate the percentage
[12:52:47] <nitrospectide> I have this simple callback function on a click that should set a class on a parent element up a few levels in the DOM that is a div with class "views-row". I'm still a jQuery noob, so I'm not sure why this isn't working. : http://pastie.org/9258908
[12:53:29] <decx> parent is only for direct parents, use closest instead
[12:53:41] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide and make sure you're waiting for document ready.
[12:54:13] <nitrospectide> decx: duch_kazatel: Let me give it a try
[12:54:19] <carpediembaby> duch_kazatel: that doesnt seem to do anything.. I mean i don't see the function being executed after the binding. Using chrome.
[12:54:36] <duch_kazatel> carpediembaby and you're waiting for document ready?
[12:55:12] <carpediembaby> duch_kazatel: it is in a timout call after an ajax call
[12:55:25] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:55:31] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ carpediembaby
[12:55:32] <b-ot> carpediembaby: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:56:05] <duch_kazatel> carpediembaby because it should be this simple: http://jsfiddle.net/3tGq4/
[12:56:17] <puchacz> hey, duch_kazatel
[12:56:34] <duch_kazatel> sup?
[12:56:35] <puchacz> if you still feel like discussing z-index, I am open
[12:56:42] <duch_kazatel> what do you need to know?
[12:56:49] <duch_kazatel> oh your overlay thing.
[12:56:55] <puchacz> see my fiddle pls, got link?
[12:56:59] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[12:57:05] <puchacz> http://jsfiddle.net/8ye7w/14/
[12:57:06] <duch_kazatel> i had to get lunch earlier.
[12:57:23] <duch_kazatel> okay.  so what's your question?
[12:57:56] <puchacz> f you drag the dialog over blocked toolbar, it behaves the way I wanted it to
[12:57:57] <puchacz> but
[12:57:59] <puchacz> if I remove z-index from toolbar markup, the spinner goes above the dialog
[12:58:00] <puchacz> I don't understand causes and effects here
[12:58:02] <puchacz> and I prefer things to work by design, not by accident :-)
[12:58:20] <skinux> How can i get post data using $.post?
[12:58:21] <puchacz> the spinner div has always huge z-index
[12:58:29] <nitrospectide> decx: I changed .parent to .closest, and it's still not working
[12:58:52] <puchacz> but to make it work, I need to wrap it with a thing that has moderate z-index....
[12:59:04] <duch_kazatel> puchacz that's a css question.
[12:59:16] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of articles out there about z-index.
[12:59:19] <puchacz> do you want me to go to #css?
[12:59:26] <duch_kazatel> or use google...
[12:59:30] <duch_kazatel> it's a simple topic.
[12:59:51] <puchacz> I am not sure what my question is exactly, "I don't understand how it works" is not a great way to approach google
[13:00:05] <puchacz> I will try #css to clarify first
[13:00:05] <duch_kazatel> !g z-index explained
[13:00:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: The Z-Index CSS Property: A Comprehensive Look | Smashing ... → http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/15/the-z-index-css-property-a-comprehensive-look/
[13:00:11] <puchacz> ok, thx
[13:00:52] <puchacz> one question then pls - are you surprised by the way it works or it is supposed to be like this?
[13:01:05] <duch_kazatel> i'm not even sure what the problem is.
[13:01:28] <puchacz> well, I needed that z-index:99 to make it work
[13:01:29] <duch_kazatel> can you try rephrasing?
[13:01:43] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[13:01:46] <puchacz> without z-index:99 spinner on toolbar was above dialog
[13:01:48] <duch_kazatel> i see what you're saying.
[13:01:50] <puchacz> (when you drag it)
[13:02:02] <duch_kazatel> did you try inspecting your html?
[13:02:13] <puchacz> yes. the div with spinner has huge z-index
[13:02:15] <puchacz> in both cases
[13:02:32] <duch_kazatel> the div with the spinner has a z-index of 99.  the modal backround is 100.
[13:02:36] <duch_kazatel> those aren't "huge" btw.
[13:03:07] <puchacz> no, dynamically added div *inside* this one you are looking at has 2000000000
[13:03:33] <BillCriswell> Do they even allow you to go that high?
[13:03:35] <duch_kazatel> which one?
[13:03:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah the max value is absurd.
[13:03:52] <duch_kazatel> max value is 2147483647
[13:04:00] <duch_kazatel> well, cross browser at least.
[13:04:24] <duch_kazatel> and puchacz the behavior you're seeing makes sense - you need to go read about z-index basics.
[13:04:26] <puchacz> it starts with <div class="spinner" role="progressbar" ... if you inspect DOM
[13:04:54] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: ok, thanks - if it is not an accident or browser incompatibilities, I will read on :-)
[13:04:56] <puchacz> thanks
[13:05:11] <duch_kazatel> it's not an accident.  there are inconsistencies between browsers, but you're good.
[13:05:23] <puchacz> I tried chrome and firefox
[13:05:34] <duch_kazatel> IE still exists ;)
[13:05:37] <puchacz> and as I say I like when things work because they are designed that way :-)
[13:05:46] <puchacz> I am on linux, can't test it easily now
[13:05:52] <duch_kazatel> sure you can - modern.ie
[13:06:02] <puchacz> ok, I will google for it
[13:06:11] <duch_kazatel> that's the url.
[13:06:28] <duch_kazatel> modern.ie - they have free VMs for testing various versions of IE.
[13:06:28] <puchacz> so far jquery was shielding me from examining cross browser nuances
[13:06:47] * puchacz naive, innit
[13:07:03] <duch_kazatel> once you start editing CSS like that you're going to experience the inconsistencies.
[13:07:15] <axilla> duch_kazatel: percent_x = (start.x / $("#folder_image_picker_modal .folder_image").width()) * 100;
[13:07:27] <puchacz> duch_kazatel, anyway, I will rtfm
[13:07:28] <duch_kazatel> axilla something like that, yeah.
[13:07:30] <axilla> can i do it like that? where start.x is the array value of my X coordiante?
[13:07:36] <axilla> its acting weird though so i dont think its right
[13:07:49] <axilla> the position is only moving vertically now
[13:07:55] <axilla> and in reverse
[13:08:07] <axilla> of my movements
[13:08:20] <axilla> down = up / up = down
[13:15:40] <freebird2> please, have cleaned the code, why doesn't this add button wont work ?? http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/8/   tks in advance
[13:15:53] <freebird2> doesn't works
[13:15:58] <duch_kazatel> what doesn't work?
[13:18:10] <duch_kazatel> and why do you have two document readies in there?
[13:18:57] <drej> because it needs to be extra ready
[13:19:45] <duch_kazatel> cleaned up a bit more: http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/12/
[13:22:36] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, not sure, but still doesn't work, do you know why ?
[13:22:46] <shoky> freebird2: you need to initialize that suggestion plugin on the new one after you append it
[13:22:48] <duch_kazatel> it's working for me.
[13:23:11] <shoky> and don't give same id to each one you append
[13:23:55] <duch_kazatel> oh that part.
[13:25:17] <freebird2> http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/12/ ??  duch_kazatel
[13:25:26] <freebird2> but the dropdown wont open
[13:25:34] <duch_kazatel> did you read what shoky said?
[13:25:40] <shoky> freebird2  http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/13/
[13:26:12] <freebird2> great, worded, fantastic, tks a lot you guys
[13:36:27] <freebird2> shoky, that was a very nice solution man, but all the 'name' will be the same correct ?
[13:36:47] <freebird2> shoky, do you think something like: name: 'sabores[]' will work ?
[13:36:56] <freebird2> http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/13/
[13:38:06] <donmatthew> someone here who knows why append works on one machine but not the other?? :s all stuff i same code, no error messages..
[13:38:43] <jp-> why doesn't the jquery-ui page publish widget market with styles and what not anymore? is there some other preferred way for applying custom styles?
[13:38:51] <jp-> *widget markup
[13:40:49] <shoky> freebird2: no idea, i don't know that magicSuggest plugin. and you can pass in any data you want to it
[13:42:15] <freebird2> shoky, no, I mean, each div, will send data, using it's 'name', but, in this case, all selects added by the button, will have the same name
[13:42:18] <shoky> jp- what do you mean
[13:42:29] <freebird2>  'Jacksonvile'  ],  name: 'sabores[]'};
[13:42:46] <freebird2> see, that's the name of var, that will have what we select
[13:42:52] <jp-> the used to publish the underlying markup for each of their included widgets with all the classes applied to each element
[13:42:54] <freebird2> 'name'
[13:43:00] <shoky> freebird2: then pass in other data if you want.
[13:43:15] <jailbot> hi
[13:43:16] <jp-> made applying custom styles pretty straight forward, i can't find it anywhere on the jquery-ui site (maybe i'm blind)
[13:43:27] <jailbot> is there a way to toggle slideup/slidedown
[13:43:35] <shoky> jp-  right-click -> inspect
[13:43:37] <jailbot> or do you have to write jenk code
[13:43:53] <jp-> shoky: yeah, ok.
[13:44:02] <shoky> jp- and they write some stuff in the main API pages, the classes used
[13:44:04] <jp-> that works too, was just curious why the took the documentation down
[13:44:45] <shoky> i don't remember them showing the full widget markups..
[13:45:02] <jp-> it's been a while but they used to.
[13:46:19] <shoky> anyway inspector is much more convenient than just the raw html
[13:48:11] <shoky> jailbot: .slideToggle()
[13:48:19] <jailbot> bitchin thanks
[13:48:34] <jp-> here's an older version of the docs that contains what i was talking about: https://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.8.4/docs/dialog.html#theming
[13:50:23] <shoky> ah
[13:51:42] <shoky> jp- well now they just write the class names with descriptions, much more informative
[13:52:18] <jp-> sure, but when you want to see why part of your style is bleeding over into other parts of the widget it's nice to see what classes have been applied to each part.
[13:53:03] <shoky> yup, and no place better to see that than dom inspector
[13:54:04] <__joshua___> yup
[14:00:09] <donmatthew> hey.. on one of my machine's the json output becomes id: "13", and on the other (the working one) it becomes id: 13
[14:00:17] <BillCriswell> Damn, some simple logic going haywire on me. Ahhh
[14:00:18] <donmatthew> why is this?
[14:00:38] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew run a typeof and see what it actually is.
[14:01:08] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: how's typeof working?
[14:01:30] <duch_kazatel> typeof yourVar;
[14:01:49] <donmatthew> where can I see the result? console?
[14:02:04] <duch_kazatel> console.log() that value and see if it's the same in each browser - substitute yourVar with withatever
[14:03:45] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: it says string on the server where my code doesn't work
[14:03:49] <donmatthew> number on my localhost
[14:04:06] <donmatthew> how come the same code makes this difference?
[14:04:59] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:05:00] <BillCriswell> donmatthew: Different browsers?
[14:05:06] <donmatthew> BillCriswell: nope
[14:05:16] <BillCriswell> Different OS?
[14:05:18] <donmatthew> I run windows, server runs centos
[14:05:44] <BillCriswell> Is it possible there's some weird sniffing doing on?
[14:05:51] <BillCriswell> s/doing/going
[14:05:53] <donmatthew> and how come this affect the code? it works good on my machine but not on the unix machine
[14:05:53] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew not sure i understand your problem then.  when it transmits over the wire, is it coming across as id: '42', or id: 42,
[14:06:05] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: well still no luck with my bind on the same place ! :)
[14:06:12] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ huh?
[14:06:21] <BillCriswell> donmatthew: Log the raw result and see what happens.
[14:06:36] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: id: 42 works fine.. id: "42" does not work
[14:06:54] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew how is it coming accross.
[14:06:58] <Mateo_> duch_kazatel: I think that’s you who helped me with that fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/Bme9n/1/
[14:07:05] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: I don't even know if that's the problem
[14:07:22] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew then what is the problem?  i'm trying to understand what your issue is to begin with...
[14:07:28] <donmatthew> The problem is append() works on my localhost, but on the dev machine it won't append.
[14:07:58] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew okay - can you show up?
[14:08:01] <duch_kazatel> *us
[14:08:02] <donmatthew> only this append.. all other jquery and stuff work fine
[14:08:42] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: same not object oriented code as before
[14:08:45] <donmatthew> a bit updated
[14:08:47] <donmatthew> :D
[14:09:19] <Mateo_> The select in a page returns me to the home :/
[14:09:31] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/Bquwvrs8
[14:09:43] <donmatthew> check function loadComments()
[14:10:17] <Azrael_-> hi, i'm using jquery-ui but in the dialog the closing-X is just an empty button. how can i fix this?
[14:10:19] <donmatthew> if I use console.log(data[key]) everything seems correct.. except that problem with id either as a string or a number
[14:10:36] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew how are you using that value?
[14:11:05] <donmatthew> hmm not at all
[14:11:09] <donmatthew> so there u have a point
[14:11:32] <donmatthew> but I can't figure out why it works on my server but not the other.. :D
[14:11:38] <donmatthew> Azrael_-: check z-index
[14:12:10] <Krinkle> angelryu: What're you up to?
[14:12:54] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew why what works?
[14:13:02] <Azrael_-> donmatthew: how can i check this? don't see it
[14:13:03] <duch_kazatel> donmatthew how are you using the value that value?
[14:13:10] <Krinkle> angelryu: I'm on the jQuery Team, and an experienced user of jQuery code. I'm not an expert in its internals though, I mostly work on other things
[14:13:11] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: the id? not at all :P
[14:13:22] <FatBoyXPC> I feel like I'm missing something obvious but how can I find out which element triggered an event?
[14:13:32] <donmatthew> duch_kazatel: problem is that the append on line 50 works on my server, but not on the other one
[14:14:09] <angelryu> krinkle , im learning jquery, just beginner
[14:14:17] <donmatthew> Azrael_-: add z-index:9999; to the close-button's css
[14:14:36] <Azrael_-> k, will try
[14:15:40] <Azrael_-> donmatthew: did but didn't help. now i can confirm, z-index wasn't set for it until now
[14:16:11] <donmatthew> ok
[14:16:14] <donmatthew> worked for me earlier today
[14:16:16] <donmatthew> :

[14:16:48] <Azrael_-> seems like not everything is added
[14:17:03] <Azrael_-> e.g. the close-text doesn't show up which is in the example
[14:17:22] <Azrael_-> could there be a problem using jquery 2.1.0 with jquery ui 1.10.4?
[14:37:57] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: why is serializing a form not a good solution for me ?
[14:41:17] <uskerine> TypeError: $(...).fnGetNodes is not a function
[14:41:18] <uskerine> var rows = $('#newInvoiceTable').fnGetNodes();
[14:43:09] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:43:25] <duch_kazatel> why do people ask me questions like that?  i barely remember what i ate for breakfast.
[14:46:11] <dotut> hello, having an issue where chrome doesn't set text when using $(this).text(...), this works OK in firefox..problem is a blocking XML-RPC call
[14:46:38] <dotut> sorry for not a more complete fiddle http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vgbeA
[14:47:11] <aabaaabe> how can i get this http://hastebin.com/ozuzunaxiw.coffee to keep making newCommentsDiv visible, that works, but to not make blueSpanDiv go away ?
[14:47:20] <dotut> The UpgradeFirmware() XML-RPC call happens right after setting text...
[14:51:39] <antlong> can anyone identify some methods I can attempt to make this chat work like a normal chat, where it scrolls to the latest message? www.multiverseminer.com click on Chat
[14:58:28] <shoky> antlong:  element.scrollTop( element.prop('scrollHeight') - element.height() )    should scroll an element to the bottom. make sure the text is there at the bottom of the element
[14:59:47] <shoky> antlong: i see decx already made you an example  http://jsfiddle.net/decx/44BVe/
[15:00:14] <antlong> it didn't work
[15:00:30] <antlong> i'll try again, and push it live if it doesn't work.
[15:00:55] <shoky> can't really understand what you're trying to do there
[15:01:08] <shoky> why is there so much space in there
[15:01:57] <shoky> give the chat text div a fixed height. or max-height
[15:02:24] <shoky> and why the float:left
[15:03:00] <shoky> oh you want it side by side?
[15:04:48] <linguini> $("#mytree>ul>li").toArray().forEach(function(value) { $(value).data("node"); }); /* is there an easier way? */
[15:05:36] <linguini> I'm using jqtree, and I suspect the toArray().forEach() can be slimmed down, but I don't know how.
[15:08:05] <shoky> antlong:  give the dialog a bigger height. remove float:left and width/height from #conversation's parent div, and instead put there:  position: absolute; left: 100px; right: 0; top: 40px; bottom: 0;
[15:09:19] <shoky> antlong: best if that div and its previous div were wrapped in another element with position:relative.  then you could change that top:40px to top:0 and stuff would be easier to position
[15:10:31] <shoky> antlong: also its  overflow-y: scroll   not overflow: scroll-y
[15:10:40] <antlong> thanks, making those edits
[15:10:57] <shoky> antlong: but put overflow:hidden on #conversation's parent
[15:12:10] <ornerymoose> If I have the following javascript variable http://codeshare.io/tQr9e , how would I put this into a jquery selector? Is this possible?
[15:17:17] <aabaaabe> what is the jquery version of var newCommentsDiv = document.getElementById('new-comments-notification')?
[15:17:46] <damasceno> Hello. I'm trying to create a Jquery Mobile listview (http://pastebin.com/SahHbghw) using a Jquery Ajax Request inside of another Jquery Ajax Request. It shows the word TITULO twice and then it shows the word ITEM. Is there a way to fix it? :S Thanks
[15:18:55] <shoky> antlong: also add height:100%  to #conversation
[15:19:39] <shoky> antlong: hard for me to say more without seeing the changes, might've missed a step so let me know when you push it
[15:19:54] <antlong> shoky i think i got most of your changes: refresh please
[15:20:41] <shoky> antlong: i don't see those changes
[15:21:21] <antlong> shoky grunt being slow, refresh now. i see it
[15:21:48] <shoky> ok
[15:22:03] <antlong> should i auto everything in the modal init code?
[15:22:44] <antlong> its using $.dialog
[15:22:44] <shoky> maybe, we're not there yet, sec
[15:23:47] <shoky> antlong: remove height from #rooms parent div
[15:23:51] <shoky> antlong: mm
[15:24:05] <antlong> ok done
[15:24:18] <shoky> antlong: you didnt do the changes i said for #conversation's parent
[15:24:42] <antlong> i think the init is setting them
[15:24:48] <antlong> i can make everything auto though
[15:24:54] <shoky> oh,
[15:25:27] <shoky> antlong: no it's in the html source..
[15:25:32] <shoky> <div style="height:450px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px;position:relative;">
[15:25:37] <antlong> hmn ok one sec
[15:25:42] <antlong> maybe i didnt push latest
[15:26:13] <antlong> shoky ok refresh
[15:28:11] <freebird2> shoky, hey man, got a better approach, not sure if you agree, but now, the remove div stopped at all, lool, http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/24/
[15:28:11] <freebird2> less code
[15:28:24] <freebird2> but can't remove the div anymore
[15:28:46] <shoky> antlong: ok thats still not what i said.  change it to:  overflow:hidden; padding: 10px; position: absolute; top: 40px; bottom: 0; left: 100px; right: 0;
[15:29:00] <antlong> #conversation ?
[15:29:02] <antlong> or the parent
[15:29:07] <shoky> the parent
[15:29:55] <shoky> and i'd change #converstaion's overflow-y  to auto instead of scroll
[15:29:59] <freebird2> shoky, sorry, there you go; http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/25/
[15:30:29] <freebird2> under drinks, whenever you can, tks
[15:30:45] <antlong> ok refresh shoky
[15:31:22] <antlong> shoky the modal has "auto" for h and w, on the init now btw. maybe thats why its small
[15:33:28] <Technodrome> when you serialize an html form, it turns it into a query string, what exactly does this query sring do?
[15:34:03] <duch_kazatel> it's for sending data to a server.
[15:34:37] <ModusPwnens> Is there a way to get the status code from the error() event?
[15:34:53] <shoky> antlong: "auto" is not a valid width/height for the dialog options
[15:35:27] <antlong> shoky for jqueryui i think
[15:35:56] <shoky> antlong: ah for height it is. not for width
[15:35:59] <antlong> .dialog({height: "auto", width:"auto"})
[15:36:00] <antlong> ahh
[15:36:08] <antlong> i can just remove those totally
[15:36:22] <shoky> best if you set the height
[15:36:26] <antlong> what to?
[15:36:37] <joephilly> Can anyone tell me what version I can use jquery.tmpl with?
[15:37:00] <shoky> either a set height e.g. 500px  or you can calculate something based on window height or whatever you want
[15:37:08] <duch_kazatel> joephilly that's been deprecated it looks it.
[15:37:33] <joephilly> what can I replace it with?
[15:37:43] <duch_kazatel> joephilly look at the github repo - it tells you :)
[15:38:13] <joephilly> duch_kazatel, that's an awfully stupid place to look. Why wouldnt I just look at the jquery site?
[15:38:37] <duch_kazatel> joephilly where did you get the link to jquery.tmpl in the first place?
[15:39:01] <joephilly> duch_kazatel, someone I know showed it to me
[15:39:08] <shoky> antlong same goes for width really
[15:39:09] <duch_kazatel> from where?
[15:39:35] <joephilly> duch_kazatel, I have no idea. It's been a few weeks
[15:39:51] <duch_kazatel> joephilly maybe i'm looking at the wrong repo... is there a homepage for the project you can point me to?
[15:40:19] <shoky> freebird2 sorry donno what you want
[15:40:58] <joephilly> duch_kazatel, I rebased my code and had osme merge conflicts and the reference to the file is now gone by accident. I'm trying to make it not be gone
[15:41:21] <duch_kazatel> ... kay
[15:41:29] <duch_kazatel> so they just handed you a file?
[15:42:12] <joephilly> <script type="text/x-jQuery-tmpl"
[15:42:22] <antlong> shoky refresh please
[15:44:02] <duch_kazatel> joephilly assuming that's from https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl, that repo has been superceded it looks like.
[15:44:36] <duch_kazatel> joephilly it looks like the project never made it out of beta.
[15:45:10] <shoky> antlong: mm i see you're not using box-sizing: border-box  :(   you definitely should, though it'll require some minor css changes here throughout
[15:45:24] <shoky> antlong: and in case you donno what i'm talking about,

[16:02:31] <dpolivy> Hi folks; any jQuery Mobile people here? I'm running into this issue (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1383) and was wondering if there's a chance of a fix coming soon.
[16:06:37] <duch_kazatel> dpolivy you probably want to ask in #jquery-dev
[16:07:47] <dpolivy> duch_kazatel: I did ask there...seems very quiet, though :)
[16:08:22] <duch_kazatel> that's where all the people who write the libraries themselves hang out.  this is just a room for those of us who use it.  some of the devs might hang out in here, too.
[16:08:27] <duch_kazatel> figured i'd point that out though.
[16:18:26] <ornerymoose> I'm trying to upload multiple files at once, and each file should represent one <tr>. However, tr:first is just extending to the right instead of making a new row below. How would I implement this? http://codeshare.io/RV8eN
[16:26:59] <Katharsis> can you share any good tips / resources for the newer in 'responsive web design way'?
[16:28:00] <duch_kazatel> Katharsis that's a pretty broad topic.
[16:28:55] <Katharsis> duch_kazatel: ok, some basics and UX recommended suggestions
[16:29:31] <duch_kazatel> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/
[16:29:39] <Katharsis> i read a few blog posts / saw solutions on stack overflow, but it's not enought for me
[16:29:55] <duch_kazatel> it's a pretty braod topic.
[16:34:14] <duch_kazatel> Katharsis have you tried building out a responsive page yet?
[16:41:29] <timgauthier> Katharsis build your page without any css, just html. Then build in your css, then build in javascript. Do it all for your mobile device, then add media queries to change as needed on larger screens
[16:42:41] <Katharsis> timgauthier: i'm doing it now
[16:42:56] <timgauthier> me as well, have fun!
[16:43:11] <Katharsis> but wanna learn / to know some pro tips
[16:43:26] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:43:39] <Katharsis> 'cos I think my code is still sux / not optimal
[16:43:56] <duch_kazatel> Katharsis are you at a company?
[16:44:41] <Katharsis> duch_kazatel: I'm doing some stuff for companies by myself
[16:44:59] <duch_kazatel> Katharsis let me rephrase - are you able to get feedback from your coworkers?
[16:45:43] <Katharsis> yes
[16:45:55] <duch_kazatel> then use that as much as possible.
[16:45:59] <duch_kazatel> do they do code review there?
[16:46:21] <Katharsis> no ;/
[16:46:42] <Katharsis> only test it by "clicking" or wirte test cases with selenium
[16:46:49] <Katharsis> write*
[16:46:52] <duch_kazatel> i'd try to find a coworker you can work with to share code review/do pair programming.
[16:47:42] <duch_kazatel> put code out and ask for feedback when you can.
[16:47:59] <duch_kazatel> be open to ALL feedback.  and never turn down an idea because it's "hard".
[16:48:14] <antlong> shoky ok im back if you still have time.
[16:48:40] <Katharsis> duch_kazatel: good advice, thx
[16:49:28] <duch_kazatel> and then tell your company to institute code review :)
[17:05:32] <Technodrome> can you ajax a remote server?
[17:05:47] <Technodrome> why would i be getting  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[17:06:19] <Technodrome> i mean of course you an ajax remote servers, i’m curious why this isn’t working
[17:07:08] <naeluh_humpday_> Technodrome: do you have any code? of course you can
[17:07:14] <Technodrome> yes
[17:07:20] <Technodrome> so why do i get that error?
[17:07:31] <Technodrome> because i’m just running from a html file?
[17:07:40] <Technodrome> and its hitting a remote server?
[17:07:50] <naeluh_humpday_> cause remote orgin but it may be happening for another reason other than your ajax
[17:08:02] <naeluh_humpday_> what are you doing with ajax?
[17:08:13] <naeluh_humpday_> can you show your code?
[17:08:29] <naeluh_humpday_> or make  a jsfiddle
[17:08:33] <naeluh_humpday_> either way
[17:12:11] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome CORS
[17:12:43] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome the remote server must allow you to pull data from another domain.
[17:12:49] <Technodrome> so basically a file can’t ajax a remote server? but if iits sitting on a web server it can?
[17:12:58] <duch_kazatel> even if it's on a web server
[17:13:50] <duch_kazatel> if the server you're requesting from doesn't allow it, you can't do it.
[17:15:01] <duch_kazatel> which is what that error is saying.
[17:20:55] <naeluh_humpday_> i guess he fixed it haha
[17:21:06] <naeluh_humpday_> or she I guess
[17:21:18] <naeluh_humpday_> for resaon Technodrome sounds like its a dude
[17:21:23] <naeluh_humpday_> some*
[17:21:36] <Technodrome> sorry , no just watching something :P
[17:21:53] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: , hmm how can I check if the server allows?
[17:22:00] <naeluh_humpday_> I am guessing it s TMNT the animated series
[17:22:07] <naeluh_humpday_> check the headers
[17:23:00] <naeluh_humpday_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1641507/detect-browser-support-for-cross-domain-xmlhttprequests or maybe you can try that
[17:23:24] <naeluh_humpday_> or  wow look at this http://client.cors-api.appspot.com/client
[17:23:51] <naeluh_humpday_> see you ladies and gents in a little bit :-)
[17:24:58] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome that error tells you ;)
[17:25:22] <Technodrome> its just a default centos install, i thought that would be open by default
[17:25:28] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:25:36] <duch_kazatel> CORS is disabled by default.
[17:25:38] <duch_kazatel> !g enable-cors
[17:25:40] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: enable cross-origin resource sharing → http://enable-cors.org/
[17:25:47] <duch_kazatel> read this.
[17:26:03] <duch_kazatel> this isn't necessary if the page is hosted at the same URL.
[17:26:05] <duch_kazatel> *domain
[17:27:17] <freebird2> you guys, I'm loading a page and jquery with ajax, all goes fine, it's parsing the JS all fine, but when I add this var, I have trouble, do I have to serialize ? or what ? var data = {data: ['dog', 'cat', 'bear'],name: 'animals'};
[17:27:35] <duch_kazatel> what error are you getting?
[17:27:42] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, me ?
[17:27:44] <duch_kazatel> yes
[17:28:09] <freebird2> gives no error, loads the ajax contents and hides it right away
[17:28:14] <freebird2> no errors in the console
[17:28:30] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code in a fiddle then?  it's fine if it doesn't function
[17:28:33] <shoky> antlong hi
[17:28:40] <antlong> hey shoky
[17:28:49] <freebird2> can I make ajax calls with jsfiddle ??
[17:28:58] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 if the remove server allows it, sure.
[17:29:43] <shoky> antlong  so.. i'd add  * { box-sizing: border-box }     :P
[17:30:17] <antlong> shoky do you want to fork and ill merge?
[17:30:30] <antlong> shoky or just tell me and i'll stumble through it :)
[17:30:54] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, this is going to be crazy, I think it's the parser, here's the parser, do you think it could be that ? txtHint is handling the xmlhttp.responseText  -->>   $("#txtHint").find("script").each(function(i) {  eval($(this).text());  });
[17:31:03] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 in a fiddle please...
[17:31:18] <duch_kazatel> eval() <-- wtf are you doing with this.
[17:31:29] <freebird2> so it accepts JS code in it
[17:31:34] <duch_kazatel> noooo
[17:31:35] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[17:31:39] <duch_kazatel> don't eval() things :(
[17:31:40] <freebird2> I see
[17:31:53] <shoky> antlong: nah don't feel like editing anything myself ;p
[17:32:01] <antlong> ok so is that for the parent div again?
[17:32:11] <shoky> it's so everything else will be easy ;]
[17:32:21] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, what should I do ? it's only showing a problem with that var, with the   '  in it
[17:32:28] <shoky> and so you don't need to care about what the margin/border/padding is when setting an element's width
[17:32:34] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 fiddle it.
[17:32:36] <shoky> or height
[17:33:34] <antlong> shoky updated
[17:33:43] <shoky> antlong: and for the dialog.. give it a fixed height and make it wider
[17:33:54] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, it's an entire system man, cakephp, can't fiddle that, too bad, it works in here : http://jsfiddle.net/PM5Fq/13/  but when I put that code inside a page that it's being returned using ajax, I have that problem
[17:34:12] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 ... i'm not asking for the whole thing.  i'm asking for a small fragment of the relevant bits.
[17:34:26] <duch_kazatel> your use of eval() tells me there's a bigger problem.
[17:34:57] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, I understand you, but I've no idea about how to ajax with fiddle, I'll try to show you something, just a  minute
[17:35:04] <antlong> shoky updated
[17:35:09] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 i all ready said it doesn't need to function.
[17:36:17] <shoky> antlong:  i meant box-sizing: border-box for ALL elements:   * { box-sizing: border-box; }
[17:36:21] <antlong> oh
[17:36:25] <antlong> all of the chat ones?
[17:36:30] <shoky> all the all ones
[17:36:32] <shoky> *
[17:36:33] <duch_kazatel> for *
[17:36:47] <shoky> did you read that paul irish link?
[17:38:16] <BillCriswell> ** *
[17:39:00] <shoky> antlong though that's up to you if you want to keep fighting widths/margins/borders etc.  the chat looks ok. not perfect yet but at least it looks like a chat now, sort of ;P
[17:39:13] <antlong> shoky updated
[17:39:23] <antlong> shoky well, the only issue left is just that it doesnt scroll to the newest message
[17:39:49] <shoky> ok, did you make it scroll?
[17:40:38] <antlong> conversation - overflow-y:scroll
[17:40:58] <shoky> that doesn't make it scroll, it just puts the scrollbar there
[17:41:02] <antlong> right
[17:41:45] <shoky> <shoky> antlong:  element.scrollTop( element.prop('scrollHeight') - element.height() )    should scroll an element to the bottom. make sure the text is there at the bottom of the element
[17:41:49] <shoky> <shoky> antlong: i see decx already made you an example  http://jsfiddle.net/decx/44BVe/
[17:42:11] <antlong> hmn
[17:42:54] <shoky> do that on $('#conversation') after appending text to it
[17:43:09] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/bYa46/   tks for looking
[17:43:44] <freebird2> those add multiselect buttons work ok, but when I try to add them using ajax, they fail duch_kazatel
[17:44:00] <shoky> antlong: dude definitely don't put box-sizing: border-box  on each element's inline style attribute...
[17:44:13] <antlong> sorry, i misunderstood
[17:44:29] <shoky> antlong: i meant put this in your css file:  * { box-sizing: border-box }
[17:44:34] <antlong> OH
[17:44:48] <shoky> it'll change a bit of widths/heights and stuff
[17:44:52] <shoky> nothing too drastic
[17:45:08] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 what's with the extra window.XMLHttpRequest check?
[17:46:03] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, not sure man, I took this code somewhere in the internet, seems to do some work in some browsers
[17:46:40] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 jquery handles all of that for you - that part is totally unnecessary.  let me poke.
[17:46:48] <freebird2> I see
[17:47:16] <freebird2> tks man
[17:47:50] <duch_kazatel> you're mixing raw js and jquery totally unnecessarily.  why not just learn wha you're doing?
[17:48:25] <freebird2> I'm doing it as I go,lool
[17:48:39] <antlong> should that be scrollTop or scrollBottom?
[17:48:39] <freebird2> took me 1 day to do those multiselects,
[17:48:46] <antlong> i just made that up, i don't know if there is a bottom
[17:48:58] <duch_kazatel> where is mainSearch even being used?
[17:49:42] <freebird2> that's when I call mainsearch.php that calls pedido.php with the multiselect code in it
[17:49:46] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,
[17:50:00] <antlong> lmfao
[17:50:07] <duch_kazatel> wat.  not following.
[17:50:08] <shoky> ;]
[17:50:09] <freebird2> inside mainsearch.php I include pedido.php
[17:50:14] <antlong> shoky that messed up the display
[17:50:21] <antlong> shoky the text is above the User: part
[17:50:34] <shoky> what?
[17:52:17] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 something here is not clicking for me.  i don't understand what mainSearch() is doing for you.
[17:53:12] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 something tells me you're trying to call code that doesn't exist on the page.
[17:53:36] <duch_kazatel> the eval() is not the right way to handle that - just have all the js you need on the parent page instead.
[17:53:47] <antlong> shoky i fixed it
[17:53:54] <antlong> shoky now to figure out how to sanitize input :P
[17:53:56] <duch_kazatel> also avoid using onclick.  that's munging your data with your logic, which is bad.
[17:54:03] <shoky> ;P
[17:54:21] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, when I add the js code in the parent page, it ignores it
[17:54:35] <duch_kazatel> right because you need to use event delegation instead.
[17:54:39] <duch_kazatel> and do not ajax in your code.
[17:54:40] <shoky> antlong: golden rule is to escape your output
[17:54:45] <freebird2> all the calls from inside the content returned thru ajax are ignored
[17:55:04] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 right - you need to use delegation and not put your code within your returned ajax.
[17:55:09] <duch_kazatel> ajax is for getting data, not logic.
[17:55:39] <freebird2> I see, so all the includes and js inside the parent page ? or only the js, not the includes ?
[17:55:42] <freebird2> duch_kazatel,
[17:55:58] <duch_kazatel> freebird2 all your *logic* should be in the parent page.
[17:56:14] <duch_kazatel> and use event delegation to handle the event bindings for things that don't exist.
[17:56:26] <freebird2> I see, so I can keep the includes anywhere right ?
[17:56:39] <duch_kazatel> not following.
[17:57:20] <freebird2> the page returned thru ajax, has some js and css includes, can I keep them in there ? or should I move them to the parent page ?
[17:57:29] <antlong> thanks a lot shoky
[17:57:30] <duch_kazatel> move them to the parent page.
[17:57:49] <freebird2> duch_kazatel, I see, and about delegatin, what should I look for man ?
[17:57:52] <duch_kazatel> the data you're returning via ajax should only be the data.
[17:57:54] <freebird2> delegating
[17:57:56] <freebird2> I see
[17:57:58] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[17:57:58] <shoky> yer welcome antlong
[17:57:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:58:02] <duch_kazatel> read that.
[17:58:33] <freebird2> lool,that's a lot man, but tks, does this has anything to do with eventListeners ?
[17:58:43] <freebird2> what should I look for specifically ?
[17:58:54] <duch_kazatel> .on() is how you should be binding event listeners.  you need to read that whole thing imo.
[17:59:00] <duch_kazatel> because you need to understand what you're doing.
[17:59:24] <freebird2> tks a lot
[18:08:07] <shoky> antlong: to get rid of the horizontal scrollbar in the chat (if you type a long word..),  make #conversation have just:  overflow:hidden; width: 100%;     and its parent should have overflow:auto  instead of overflow:hidden
[18:08:31] <shoky> antlong:  and if you make that change, you'll need to set the scrollTop on the parent instead of on #conversation itself
[18:12:45] <neataroni> here is a really tough one: if i grab something like foo = $('#someSelector'), how do i then get stuff inside foo using selectors?
[18:13:06] <__joshua___> foo.find()
[18:13:17] <__joshua___> foo.find('li.myclass')
[18:13:30] <__joshua___> or $('li.myclass', foo);
[18:15:10] <shoky> antlong: actually... scratch that, i think you can just put overflow-x: hidden on #conversation to get rid of it
[18:15:54] <antlong> shoky thanks, done
[18:17:23] <shoky> btw you should really start using css classes ;p
[18:44:41] <damasceno> I have two .js files: jquery-mobile.js and JFForms.js. The JFForms.js is giving me problems, if I use it for some reason the jquery mobile popup closes after 1 second, if I remove this file from the header it works but I can't remove it because it creates a special HTML Select. Does anyone know how can I force to use the popup code from the jquery-mobile.js file?
[19:00:25] <ontime> Hello everyone.  I know you will probably wonder why I am asking, but I really don't know how to make this code work.  I'm proficient with html and css, but not with JS.  The link is here: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/highlighting-content-based-on-clicked-anchor-from-another-page  --- Thanks in advance.
[19:01:35] <ontime> What it is supposed to do is: when clicking on an anchored link on page 1, it will goto page 2, scroll to the anchor.  The anchor will also be highlighted.
[20:29:25] <derrida> should loading jquery.mobile have side effects on desktop browsers?
[20:30:48] <derrida> supporting safari/mobilesafari is such a pain :\
[20:53:36] <jayar> how do i make setTimeout() trigger an animation every 5 mins or so
[20:53:52] <jayar> instead of once after a certain amount of time
[20:54:19] <jayar> or wait i guess i could make it a function and use a callback...
[20:57:40] <wa5ted> hey
