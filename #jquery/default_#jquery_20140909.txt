[00:10:14] <litropy> Any idea why ind isn't incrementing? $(data).find('artwork').each(function(ind, j) {
[00:10:27] <litropy> I'm operating on an XML object
[00:10:38] <Cork> what is $(data).find('artwork').length?
[00:15:34] <litropy> Cork, data length is 5.
[00:16:23] <litropy> Cork, Or, to be more specific, console.log( 'xmldata is ' + $(data).find('artwork').length ) \\ 5
[00:16:25] <Cork> litropy: then ind should work
[00:23:21] * litropy facepalms. Of course it's working.
[00:23:40] <litropy> Thanks, Cork.
[00:23:56] <Cork> :)
[00:26:44] <litropy> Cork, I really don't need the j, do I? $(data).find('artwork').each(function(ind) {  // will work the same; I just use $(this)?
[00:27:01] <Cork> litropy: yes
[00:27:04] <litropy> thx
[00:27:26] <Cork> litropy: it might be a convenient to get a variable you can pass to callbacks
[00:27:36] <litropy> gotcha
[00:27:53] <Cork> .each(function(i,e) { $.ajax().done(function() { $(e) }) })
[00:33:31] <mork1> hi all!
[00:34:33] <mork1> I have a webpage where jquery seems to work only on localhost, but when published in production it fails. I can't understand why, even with Firebug...
[00:35:26] <mork1> would anyone give a try
[00:35:31] <mork1> please
[00:36:00] <Cork> mork1: most likely it is a race situation
[00:36:32] <mork1> sorry, could you explain what a "race" is
[00:36:34] <Cork> mork1: where are you loading your scripts?
[00:37:04] <Cork> header, end of body, through scripts (require.js)
[00:37:14] <litropy> omg it works
[00:37:21] <litropy> le sigh - thx everyone
[00:37:28] <aaairc> anyone in here familiar with jPlayer? for some reason, doing ".play()" on my samsung galaxy s5 doesn't do anything.
[00:40:37] <mork1> Cork: in the header
[00:40:52] <Cork> mork1: are you using .ready or $(function() {}) ?
[00:41:05] <Cork> (yes or no question)
[00:46:00] <mork1> Cork: yes
[00:46:25] <Cork> and if you put a console.log or alert in the ready callback does it fire?
[00:46:38] <mork1> Cork: didn't try yet
[00:46:48] <mork1> the loader.gif is loaded
[00:46:50] <Cork> also no errors in the console?
[00:46:53] <mork1> nope
[01:21:36] <mgl> hi all
[01:22:13] <mgl> anyone know how to set value of Jqeury autocomplete combobox?
[01:23:40] <fires> hi
[01:24:09] <fires> I am new with jquery so I have some new questions
[01:24:11] <fires> :)
[01:24:18] <Cork> mgl: it is just a normal input field
[01:24:28] <Cork> mgl: so just set it with .val() like any other ones
[01:24:28] <fires> I am trying to make a workaround to fix a bug in highcharts
[01:24:37] <mgl> i want to set value after form post
[01:24:45] <fires> So, I am doing $('.highcharts-series')
[01:24:49] <fires> that gives me an array
[01:24:54] <fires> how can I access the first position?
[01:25:12] <Cork> mgl: after post??
[01:25:21] <Cork> fires: what exactly are you trying to do
[01:25:44] <mgl> after click submit
[01:25:47] <Cork> jquery is an array like object, so you often don't have to
[01:26:01] <Cork> mgl: so you mean after the use asks to submit, but before it is?
[01:26:03] <fires> Cork: I am trying to modify some properties afther the plot is rendered
[01:26:15] <Cork> or you want to show a "submitted" value instead of what they submitteD?
[01:26:25] <Cork> fires: meaning?
[01:26:34] <Cork> .attr? .prop? .css? or what?
[01:27:12] <fires> Cork: I think is .attr
[01:27:13] <fires> <rect x="142" y="-12475" width="70" height="25000" stroke="black" stroke-width="0.4" fill="rgb(0,115,64)">
[01:27:26] <Cork> ok
[01:27:28] <mgl> yes i need to set autocomplete comobox value = $_POST['cbo']
[01:27:56] <Cork> $('.highcharts-series').first().prop('stroke', <newvalue>);
[01:28:06] <Cork> mgl: you can't do that
[01:28:24] <Cork> mgl: you have to send the cbo value back to client side
[01:28:29] <Cork> and then set it in js
[01:28:35] <fires> Cork: So I have come to $('.highcharts-series')[0].children
[01:28:42] <fires> now I have to do it for each children
[01:28:44] <mgl> how to set that value
[01:28:52] <Cork> fires: your over complicating things
[01:29:02] <Cork> fires: ok, lets back up a bit
[01:29:11] <Cork> what is the structure you need to access?
[01:29:23] <fires> Cork: 1s, I will show you
[01:30:01] <Cork> mgl: ok first you have to be sending the form value through ajax
[01:30:12] <mgl> ok
[01:30:16] <mgl> i can do that
[01:30:19] <Cork> mgl: then as a response from the server you either send the value as plain text
[01:30:23] <Cork> or you send a json response
[01:30:30] <Cork> and then in the .done callback from the ajax call
[01:30:37] <Cork> you set the value on the field
[01:31:06] <mgl> set the input value?
[01:31:16] <Cork> mgl: but if you're using autocomplete, why arn't you just sending this as part of the autocomplete response?
[01:31:20] <Cork> mgl: yes
[01:33:46] <fires> Cork: I want to change that "y" in all the childs: http://s27.postimg.org/ri67ek06r/image.png
[01:33:55] <mork1> thanks
[01:34:10] <Cork> fires: by the same amount?
[01:34:15] <mork1> Cork: thanks, i'll try to check the ready
[01:34:48] <fires> Cork: yes
[01:34:59] <Cork> correction, to the same value or relative
[01:35:04] <fires> same value
[01:35:22] <Cork> fires: so $('.highcharts-series').first().children().attr('x', 100);
[01:35:46] <Cork> fires: or $('.highcharts-series:first > rect').attr('x', 100);
[01:35:49] <fires> Cork: there are more than 1 children, is it applied to all?
[01:35:53] <Cork> yes
[01:36:14] <Cork> set applies to all, get doesn't
[01:36:23] <Cork> also use prop not attr
[01:36:27] <fires> nice, I will try
[01:37:01] <Cork> fires: attr should only be used when you want to access the raw attribute value of the node
[01:37:14] <Cork> for all other cases you should use .prop
[01:38:49] <fRAiLtY-> If you have this <div id="top"><div class="inner"><a>test</a></div></div> how do I select the #top on click of the <a>
[01:39:08] <Cork> $('#top')
[01:39:15] <Cork> it is unique after all
[01:39:33] <fRAiLtY-> Cork sorry, I wasn't very clear, when the id could be variable, so like the parent's parent element
[01:39:55] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: does the parent have a class or anything to identify it?
[01:40:14] <fRAiLtY-> Only a class that applies to several other things on the page
[01:40:26] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: else you would have to use something nasty like $(this).closest('div[id]')
[01:41:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it only matters if the div is the only parent with the class
[01:41:25] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then it would be $(this).closest('.class-name')
[01:42:33] <fRAiLtY-> Cork cheers, just noticed this in opencart's default theme lol: 	$(this).parent().parent().find('.checkout-content').slideDown('slow');
[01:42:36] <fRAiLtY-> Take it that's nasty?
[01:42:58] <Cork> ya
[01:43:11] <Cork> as it depends on nothing ever adding an additional element level
[01:43:24] <Cork> cause then the script will break
[01:47:04] <fires> Cork: thank you, it works perfect :)
[01:50:03] <HowardwLo> is it necessary to update meta tags after ajaxing pages?
[01:50:12] <Cork> no
[01:50:27] <Cork> meta tags is for spiders mostly
[01:50:49] <HowardwLo> right, i thought so
[01:50:54] <HowardwLo> cause spiders request links themselves
[01:51:07] <HowardwLo> as long as my pages display the correct meta tags to begin with, its all fine, ya?
[02:12:57] <tuskkk___> Why isnt this working? http://codepad.org/1diktGmc
[02:18:27] <Expel> tuskkk___: It reminds me of Codecademy.
[02:18:39] <rethus> whats the best way to load all images of an popup image gallery only if the popuplink is clicked (and not on page-load).
[02:18:53] <rethus> or does images marked as display:none not preloaded?
[02:18:53] <tuskkk___> Expel: copied from here, http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-bay3D/0/1?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1
[02:21:31] <Expel> tuskkk___: You can try to use the event.preventDefault;
[02:28:12] <tuskkk___> bloddy hell, its working on jsfiddle and not in the browser
[02:32:24] <tuskkk___> getting, ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[02:52:08] <jqdeveloper> how to hide page source or page inspect element code
[02:52:50] <jqdeveloper> is cork is there??
[02:55:31] <VectorX> how can i use this http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#alt-field and add the date elements to 3 fields ? to 3 input boxes as day, month and year
[03:02:06] <blackkbot> <input type="date"> </input> isn't so bad either
[03:07:51] <VectorX> blackkbot if that was for me, i need the components separate
[03:08:02] <blackkbot> yeah 1 sec
[03:10:21] <aleray> hi, I have a doc with several elements sharing a same class. If I select, let say, the one in the middle, Is there a way to find the previous and the next ones in the doc
[03:13:14] <AdamPDotty> like .prev() and .next() ?
[03:13:40] <AdamPDotty> are they adjacent?
[03:15:12] <andrju> Hey guys, i've got a weird case in jquery and would like to ask if any of you knows how to make it work. I will try to create jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/ea5vbrr7/ so what i want to do is when i select first option- there should be a dollar sign inside input, when i selected 2nd 3rd sign should appear only if 'amount' is selected in second select and not appear if "percent" is selected etc etc
[03:15:29] <andrju> I tried listening to change on main select and second select, but it doesnt work as it is supposed to.
[03:16:11] <aleray> AdamPDotty, no
[03:16:18] <aleray> they are not djacent
[03:16:21] <andrju> It doesn't look as it is supposed to on jsfiddle, but it shows what i have to do.
[03:16:28] <andrju> Dependance on two selects at the same time.
[03:17:12] <AdamPDotty> hmm so var idx = $myObject.index(myElement);
[03:17:12] <AdamPDotty> var nextElement = $myObject[idx + 1];
[03:20:13] <andrju> AdamPDotty: could you take a peak at my case please?
[03:29:00] <sahbeewah> andrju: your js only executes once on load, and never goes into the the big IF statement
[03:29:47] <andrju> So how would i make it execute every time i use select?
[03:30:37] <sahbeewah> google “javascript event handling”
[03:32:15] <andrju> sahbeewah: ?
[03:32:45] <andrju> I mean i was trying to place .on 'change' before that big if statement
[03:32:46] <aleray> AdamPDotty, thanks
[03:32:48] <andrju> but it wouldnt work too
[03:44:23] <ruibrito> hey friend, any hints into doing an ajax jquery call with SSL?
[03:48:05] <matty_r> I'm trying to get the value from a particular column from each row in a table. I have $('#table tr').each(.... and then $('td', this).each .. but I can't seem to filter it for results from one column.
[03:48:15] <Cork> ruibrito: you get ssl if the site you connect to does
[03:48:28] <Cork> ruibrito: you don't have to do anything special
[03:48:58] <ruibrito> Cork: i creating my server, how can i make it use SSL then?
[03:49:10] <ruibrito> Cork: thanks for answering btw :)
[03:49:15] <Cork> matty_r: $('#table td:nth-child(3)')
[03:49:47] <matty_r> Cork: Cheers mate, i'll give it a go
[03:50:07] <Cork> ruibrito: you need to give it an ssl sert (if you want this public you need to contact a ssl store to buy one)
[03:50:18] <Cork> ruibrito: configure your site to use it and switch to https
[03:51:58] <matty_r> Cork: that works well, how would I read that value as a date? I'm trying to only show for example one that was in the last 7 days
[03:52:06] <ruibrito> Cork: any workaround to avoid that? right now I am developing this as a school project, and I don't like the idea of sensitive information in the URL
[03:52:29] <matty_r> Cork: the format is DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm am/pm
[03:53:12] <Cork> matty_r: $('#table td:nth-child(3)').filter(function() { return $(this).text() /* validate date there */; })
[03:53:43] <Cork> the ugly part here is about getting something to identify if the date is older then seven days
[03:54:33] <matty_r> Yea, thats the part i'm having a drama with
[03:54:46] <matty_r> something like the parseDate might work
[03:54:51] <usc911> hey guys, I have a list of items but I need to check to see if, lets say div one has a div after with the class "foo", anybody got a suggestion? thanks!
[04:03:55] <Nomikos> usc911: filter(), have the function check the children of each element for div.foo
[04:04:28] <Nomikos> if you need to check it for all items, that is
[04:05:23] <Nomikos> hm, maybe has() is simpler still
[04:08:31] <tapia> Hi! I'm trying to build a FormData object, but I don't know how to create a "field_name[]" field containing an array of integers
[04:08:37] <tapia> Could someone give me a hint?
[04:19:59] <Cork> tapia: you normally add field_name[] multiple times
[04:20:12] <Cork> one time for each value in the array
[04:20:33] <Cork> tapia: www-form-encoded data can't have arrays, just repeated keys
[04:20:56] <Cork> meaning field_name[]=v1&field_name[]=v2&field_name[]=v3...
[04:23:20] <frank_o> Hi! Is it true if I do `$.fn.someFunction = function(container) {...}`, I can call it with `someFunction()` instead of `$.fn.someFunction()`?
[04:23:32] <Cork> no
[04:23:42] <frank_o> Ah, just checking :)
[04:23:58] <Cork> upi cam call it as $('selector').someFunction() though
[04:24:01] <Cork> cam==can
[04:24:06] <Cork> ...
[04:24:10] <Cork> *you can call it as
[04:24:48] <tapia> Cork: what's wrong with field_name[]=[1,2,3,4]
[04:25:09] <blackkbot> the first []
[04:25:12] <Cork> tapia: well technically nothing
[04:25:13] <frank_o> oh really?
[04:25:14] <tapia> i've used it before, I'm only trying to build it with FormData
[04:25:19] <blackkbot> field_name = [1,2,3,4]
[04:25:24] <Cork> except you would have to write a special parser server side
[04:25:28] <frank_o> now that would be awesome.
[04:25:33] <Cork> as server code doesn't parse [] for params
[04:25:38] <Cork> (by default)
[04:25:51] <Cork> to send an array like that you normally have to encode it as json
[04:26:02] <tapia> Django does, that's not the problem :-)
[04:26:23] <blackkbot> well you would be defining  an empty array to the value of [1,2,3,4] and you also declared field_name but that would be undefined
[04:26:25] <frank_o> oh by the way Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rv73g1dw/4/ think im going for that as far as that SVG pie animation is concerned. fixes that chrome bug at least
[04:26:59] <Cork> tapia: then do JSON.encode(arr)
[04:27:05] <Cork> and hope the server can handle it
[04:27:11] <Cork> i suspect it won't
[04:27:13] <Cork> but anyway
[04:27:48] <tapia> JSON.encode?
[04:27:54] <Cork> soryr
[04:27:56] <tapia> Do you mean JSON.stringify() =
[04:27:59] <tapia> ?
[04:28:03] <Cork> ya
[04:28:13] <frank_o> (but have to include Snap.svg =/)
[04:28:17] <tapia> It doesn't work, I've tried it before
[04:28:34] <Cork> tapia: most likely cause you have to send it as json and not as www-form-encoded
[04:28:48] <Cork> as, again www-form-encoded doesn't support arrays
[04:29:41] <Cork> frank_o: so you moved to js animations
[04:29:52] <Cork> you couldn't get the svg animations to work?
[04:30:12] <frank_o> i pussied out i guess =/
[04:30:35] <Cork> frank_o: well js animations isn't hardware accelerated
[04:30:44] <Cork> so ya, (the current animations lag here)
[04:30:57] <frank_o> hmm
[04:31:53] <blackkbot> ive have a computer with a ton of ram and a great gpu and it doesn't accelerate any webpages unless i specifically tell it to run with the gpu by changing like 2 or 3 settings
[04:32:31] <Cork> blackkbot: most likely cause you have old drivers or a gpu that break on rendering webpages
[04:32:49] <blackkbot> nope actually the most recent drivers i don't wanna ge the beta drivers tho
[04:33:01] <matty_r> Cork: say I have an array var divStrings = ["#divOne","#divTwo"] , how do I then loop through each using $('divStrings[x] td:nth-child(5)).each(function(){...
[04:33:03] <Cork> browsers has quite big lists of blacklisted driver+hardwar combinations
[04:33:23] <blackkbot> true but its not really accelerated if i can't turn it off
[04:33:49] <Cork> matty_r: $(divStrings.join(', ')).find('td:nth-child(5)').each
[04:34:07] <Cork> blackkbot: uh, why not?
[04:34:08] <matty_r> Cork: just as you responded I got it
[04:34:09] <matty_r> lol
[04:34:14] <matty_r> Thanks Cork
[04:34:33] <Cork> matty_r: don't concat the array into the first $() call though
[04:35:44] <matty_r> I used $(divStrings[x]+' td:nth-child(5)').each...
[04:36:33] <Cork> matty_r: ya, that is a bad choice
[04:36:40] <matty_r> Cork: how come?
[04:36:45] <Cork> also if you do  $(divStrings.join(', ')).find('td:nth-child(5)') you can handle both at once
[04:37:19] <Cork> matty_r: cause concating selectors is something that is fragile
[04:37:38] <Cork> matty_r: it is more safe to split them into separate function calls to jquery
[04:37:41] <Cork> $().find()
[04:37:59] <Cork> it is often also easier to read
[04:38:03] <matty_r> Cork: ok i'll give that a shot
[04:38:08] <bl4ckdu5t> I was working on an application and I implemented my filtering this way http://jsfiddle.net/wsfvtgng/
[04:39:00] <matty_r> Cork: Cool, that works . :) cheers mate
[04:39:01] <bl4ckdu5t> Everything was fine till I was requested to have something that keeps a recent filter while other filtering is done
[04:39:10] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: why not just set the field as a data attribute on the select element
[04:39:21] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: and handle all of them with one event handler?
[04:40:28] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: you would also have to collect all the select boxes values for each update
[04:40:36] <Cork> so you know what should be shown or not
[04:41:22] <bl4ckdu5t> something like quicksand http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[04:41:45] <bl4ckdu5t> type filtering and the sorting
[04:41:53] <bl4ckdu5t> It's not a perfect example though
[04:42:49] <bl4ckdu5t> you mean store them in variables? to know what filter has been used?
[04:43:02] <Cork> no
[04:43:48] <Cork> <select class="gender filter" data-filter="gender">
[04:45:03] <matty_r> Cork: It didn't work for multiple
[04:45:32] <Cork> huh?
[04:45:38] <bl4ckdu5t> ok I think I get it now. I'll try that. Thanks cork
[04:45:44] <Cork> matty_r: ah
[04:45:53] <bl4ckdu5t> * Cork
[04:45:55] <Cork> matty_r: what doesn't work
[04:46:09] <matty_r> CorK; It worked, on the first item in the array but none after that
[04:48:37] <matty_r> Cork: actually, if use .join I don't need to loop do I?
[04:49:14] <matty_r> I think thats what I did wrong
[04:49:29] <Cork> matty_r: http://jsfiddle.net/1fm8u31z/
[04:49:32] <Cork> works fine here
[04:49:43] <Cork> opps
[04:49:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/1fm8u31z/1/
[04:50:03] <Cork> forgot to change the reference number for table2
[04:50:41] <matty_r> cork: yea I did it wrong
[04:50:55] <matty_r> I still have my for loop in there
[04:50:58] <matty_r> fixing now
[04:51:57] <angelivanov> test
[04:54:38] <oskob> if i get "-1" from $('.something').index()
[04:54:58] <oskob> what could that mean? how can an index be -1 ?
[04:55:13] <matty_r> out of bounds
[04:55:13] <oskob> does it not have a parent?
[04:55:24] <Cork> oskob: it means $('.something').length == 0
[04:55:37] <oskob> ah
[04:56:46] <AdamPDotty> hmm
[04:57:06] <AdamPDotty> $('div').index('not_here');
[04:57:30] <AdamPDotty> -1 when index does not exist
[04:57:54] <AdamPDotty> so length might be 266
[04:57:55] <Cork> AdamPDotty: he didn't give index an argument though
[04:58:25] <AdamPDotty> I just tried on a random site
[04:58:32] <AdamPDotty> 266 DIVs
[04:58:39] <AdamPDotty> index(9 gave me 157
[04:58:46] <matty_r> Cork: got it working, thanks mate.
[04:58:51] <Cork> matty_r: nice
[04:59:02] <AdamPDotty> so probably element 158 got empty index
[04:59:07] <matty_r> Cork: started showing errors for console.. no idea why
[04:59:10] <Cork> AdamPDotty: no
[04:59:19] <Cork> matty_r: what is the error?
[04:59:43] <matty_r> Said it was unrecognized
[05:00:11] <Cork> matty_r: are you sure you join(',') the array?
[05:00:26] <Cork> also that the ids has # in them
[05:00:38] <matty_r> Cork: yea, it worked as expected when I just got rid of the console.log
[05:00:56] <matty_r> Cork: couldn't spot anything wrong, it was weird
[05:01:20] <AdamPDotty> ah ok, index() is not quite what I thought
[05:01:37] <Cork> AdamPDotty: it is, among other things
[05:02:23] <matty_r> Cork: sorry, it says console is undefined
[05:02:32] <Cork> ie?
[05:02:36] <matty_r> yea
[05:02:41] <Cork> ya
[05:02:49] <matty_r> But i've been using console.log the whole time
[05:02:51] <Cork> console is undefined in ie unless you have the developer tools open
[05:03:01] <matty_r> ahhh
[05:03:12] <Cork> one of the many ie weirdness
[05:03:14] <matty_r> damn it
[05:03:30] <Cork> wouldn't choose it as my development browser for anything
[05:03:48] <matty_r> ha ha, I wouldn't if I had a choice... i'm using ie 8 for gods sake
[05:04:00] <matty_r> on windows xp
[05:04:05] <Cork> O_o
[05:04:11] <matty_r> yep...
[05:04:22] <matty_r> Really good isn't it.
[05:04:23] <Cork> you know xp has known unpatched security holes right?
[05:04:38] <matty_r> Don't tell me, tell the company I work for ha ha
[05:04:43] <Cork> ouch
[05:05:04] <matty_r> And Office 2003 ha ha ha
[05:05:06] <_rgn> you have choice to change the place you work
[05:05:34] <Cork> _rgn: you can choose not to have food on the table too
[05:05:53] <_rgn> you can but i wouldn't choose that option
[05:05:59] <_rgn> unless you want to starve to death
[05:06:21] <matty_r> Now thats a choice.. starvation or IE 8 + XP + Office 2003
[05:06:28] <matty_r> ha ha
[05:06:30] <Cork> heh
[05:06:30] <Cork> ya
[05:06:45] <Cork> matty_r: and the site depends on activex too?
[05:07:05] <_rgn> if i may ask, where do you live if that is your only option besides starvation?
[05:07:10] <matty_r> cork: Yea, activeX is running
[05:07:15] <Cork> lovely
[05:07:20] <Cork> straight out of the 90's
[05:07:25] <matty_r> yep
[05:07:39] <matty_r> It's not about where I live, it's about where I work
[05:07:42] <prohobo> hey, why is it that when i set: $(this).css({'background-color':'#487c8f','color':'#FFFFFF'}); the :hover color styling stops working?
[05:08:08] <prohobo> :hover css still works (cursor turns to hand) but the color doesn't change anymore
[05:08:16] <Cork> prohobo: cause setting color in css is the same as setting it on the element
[05:08:26] <Cork> and that implies !important
[05:08:36] <Cork> so :hover can't override it, as it is set on the element
[05:08:40] <prohobo> oh
[05:08:45] <Cork> prohobo: so you should set that with a class instead
[05:08:50] <Cork> and use addClass
[05:08:52] <prohobo> i see, thanks
[05:09:01] <Cork> or toggleClass
[05:09:18] <bl4ckdu5t> Cork: I don't think it's good to just put !important in cases like that
[05:09:31] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: read my response again
[05:09:32] <bl4ckdu5t> I'd rather use chained classes
[05:09:53] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[05:10:08] <Cork> .css $(this).css({'color':'#FFFFFF'}) == <elm style="color:#fff"> == color: #fff !important
[05:10:23] <Cork> so :hover can't override it
[05:10:31] <prohobo> setting !important to the :hover color fixes the problem as well
[05:10:44] <Cork> ya, but you shoudn't use !important
[05:10:49] <prohobo> alright
[05:11:15] <Cork> there is just a very few situations where !important is actually the correct solution
[05:11:41] <AdamPDotty> "fixes"
[05:12:56] <jq> how to prevent page inspect element and view page source
[05:13:21] <Cork> jq: write a java app
[05:13:27] <Cork> or a flash app
[05:13:44] <AdamPDotty>  or print it
[05:13:47] <jq> i am working with php
[05:13:48] <Cork> you can't prevent source access or element inspect in a browser
[05:14:04] <jq> ok
[05:14:25] <jq> one more think
[05:14:42] <AdamPDotty> s/k/g/
[05:14:44] <bl4ckdu5t> The only thing you may be able to do is disable right click
[05:14:50] <bl4ckdu5t> jq: ^
[05:14:51] <AdamPDotty> not really
[05:15:08] <jq> how to compress image in website so website is loading fast even internet connection is goes slow
[05:15:11] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: but all browsers allow you to override that
[05:15:13] <bl4ckdu5t> but that will only stop less tech people from right-clicking and selecting view page source
[05:15:21] <bl4ckdu5t> ctrl + U will still show it
[05:15:28] <Cork> jq: simplest is to use png crush
[05:15:38] <Cork> or mozjpeg
[05:15:44] <Cork> depending on format
[05:16:14] <jq> is any htaccess code for that
[05:16:20] <Cork> heh no
[05:16:28] <Cork> you have to preprocess that
[05:16:32] <Cork> ?g pngcrush
[05:16:34] <b-ot> Cork: PNGCRUSH - SourceForge → http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/
[05:16:36] <Cork> ?g mozjpeg
[05:16:39] <b-ot> Cork: mozilla/mozjpeg · GitHub → https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg
[05:17:19] <jq> my website is totally client side my client uploding their photo from admin
[05:17:30] <Cork> jq: then you have no option
[05:17:42] <Cork> if the images is client side
[05:17:49] <Cork> you have no preprocessing option
[05:17:55] <Cork> and have to load what the user picks
[05:18:07] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to do like http://css-tricks.com/text-fade-read-more/ -- except I changed the code to expand/contract when clicking on the `.article` itself. But how come it's a few pixels short of the total height of the `.article`? I'm using `outerHeight()`. http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8ssrmxwp/8/
[05:18:30] <jq> if i compress size with php then what made effect on image quality
[05:19:37] <Cork> jq: you just said it was client side
[05:19:42] <Cork> you don't have php client side
[05:19:58] <Cork> frank_o: $(this).outerHeight(true)
[05:20:03] <mooncup> how do you know he doesn't have a javascript php compiler!?
[05:20:03] <jq> yes client side. if i do that in my codeing
[05:20:09] <Cork> your not counting the margins right now
[05:20:25] <Cork> mooncup: lol good luck with that
[05:20:52] <frank_o> Cork: ha! wow thanks man :)
[05:21:03] <frank_o> i've been at this for 4 hours and you solve it in 4 sec
[05:21:11] <frank_o> *shake my head*
[05:21:25] <matty_r> I think Cork is a bot
[05:26:35] <matty_r> I'm using a simple switch statement based on the id of the chkbox switch(chkbox.id){case... but for whatever reason it's not working chkbox is the checkbox sent to the function.
[05:26:59] <Cork> matty_r: make a fiddle
[05:27:13] <matty_r> Huh?
[05:27:17] <matty_r> oh that website
[05:27:18] <Cork> ?g jsfiddle
[05:27:19] <matty_r> yep
[05:27:19] <b-ot> Cork: JSFiddle: Create a new fiddle → http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:28:01] <matty_r> code is on another machine though
[05:28:29] <Cork> matty_r: generally it should work
[05:28:42] <matty_r> Cork: yea, thats what I though
[05:28:44] <matty_r> t
[05:29:38] <matty_r> if I do alert(chkbox.id); just to test (Outside of the switch) it returns the expected string
[05:30:40] <Cork> and in the switch you do switch(chkbox.id) { case 'id1': case 'id2': break; else: break; } ?
[05:30:52] <matty_r> yep
[05:31:07] <matty_r> I must be doing something wrong again lol
[05:31:08] <Cork> all i can say it "it should work"
[05:31:19] <Cork> *say is
[05:32:31] <zagaza> hi guys, how can I [do something], then wait 5sec, then [do something else], then wait 5s, then loop again ?
[05:32:50] <matty_r> might have to come back to that one
[05:32:53] <Cork> zagaza: you create a recusive timer function
[05:33:09] <Cork> unless you want animations then you have built in support in jquery
[05:33:44] <Cork> zagaza: function next() { setTimeout(next, 5000); } next();
[05:33:57] <Cork> i would strongly recommend to use requestAnimationFrame too though
[05:34:04] <sakthi>  show first element and other element  hide in document ready
[05:34:10] <Cork> so the page doesn't keep doing this over and over again if the page loses focus
[05:34:13] <blackkbot> so you wantsetTimeout( function every5seconds() {    setTimeout(every5seconds,5000); },5000);
[05:34:47] <Cork> blackkbot: that will just run twice though
[05:34:55] <blackkbot> no
[05:35:01] <Cork> ah
[05:35:05] <matty_r> lol
[05:35:29] <Cork> mised the every5seconds in the last setTimeout call
[05:35:31] <zagaza> cool gonna try thanks
[05:35:38] <zagaza> Cork: requestAnimationFrame? why?
[05:35:48] <Cork> zagaza: cause it only fires when the page has focus
[05:35:54] <zagaza> ok cool
[05:36:01] <Cork> so you don't keep spinning your weals when there is nothing to do
[05:36:02] <blackkbot> noo
[05:36:39] <blackkbot> http://codepen.io/blackkbot/pen/Ahaqp
[05:36:54] <blackkbot> wrong example lol
[05:37:31] <Cork> zagaza: function next() { /* action goes here */ window.requestAnimationFrame(function() { setTimeout(next, 5000); }); } next();
[05:37:56] <jq> cork: ok thanx
[05:39:40] <zagaza> Cork: so this should work? http://jsfiddle.net/vnfwu6jn/
[05:40:12] <Cork> zagaza: if you use animate you can just use .delay(5000)
[05:40:43] <zagaza> I want to change the background position back to 0 though
[05:40:50] <zagaza> first animate to 100%, then set back to 0%
[05:40:56] <zagaza> and loop
[05:41:00] <zagaza> will that work with delay?
[05:41:07] <Cork> zagaza: http://jsfiddle.net/vnfwu6jn/1/
[05:41:25] <Cork> zagaza: just check what the value should be and pick direction
[05:41:27] <Cork> or use toggle
[05:41:37] <Cork> as in 'toggle'
[05:42:02] <zagaza> toggle instead of animate? sorry pretty much a newbie at js
[05:42:12] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/animate/#animation-properties
[05:42:14] <pascallammers> #css,#grunt,#html5,##javascript,#svg
[05:42:15] <Cork> nope
[05:45:05] <zagaza> toggle won't work on backgroundposition
[05:45:08] <zagaza> it just weirds out
[05:45:14] <Cork> ah, pitty
[05:48:01] <sakthi> plz tel me  how to  show first child and other child hide in document ready
[05:48:32] <Cork> sakthi: first child of what?
[05:50:23] <sakthi> show the first element content
[05:50:40] <Nomikos> $('*').show() :-)
[05:50:44] <Nomikos> ehr, no
[05:50:45] <Nomikos> nem
[05:51:09] <zagaza> I'll just use css keyframes instead
[05:52:12] <sakthi> show the first element  and other element hide in document ready
[05:53:16] <sakthi> cork :
[05:53:27] <sakthi> cork*
[05:53:44] <Cork> so you want to show the first random element on a random page?
[05:53:50] <Cork> what first element?
[05:54:20] <Cork> your asking how to do y on children x
[05:54:24] <Cork> but you never say what x is
[05:55:58] <sakthi> yes
[05:56:44] <Cork> lol nice response
[06:00:48] <sakthi> plz tel me , show one element of a class and hide all others ...
[06:01:15] <sakthi> plz tell me , show one element of a class and hide all others ...
[06:02:57] <blackkbot> ok so have the class set to hide all the elements by default and then add the visibility to the elements style
[06:04:23] <tuskkk___> I need a tutorial to upload images using AJAX
[06:05:17] <razlap> hello, i'm using a jquery script with the function ga(...) to send stuff to google analytics. where can I figure out if the datas have been counted :s ?
[06:05:44] <Cork> razlap: check the googleanalytics api page
[06:05:49] <sakthi> yes i already try this but i want default one class show then other all the elements hide
[06:06:06] <razlap> Cork: ye but it has many places
[06:06:32] <Cork> razlap: this channel is for jquery not google analytics support
[06:07:04] <razlap> indeed sir, indeed
[06:07:18] <sakthi> Cork: plz tell me , show one element of a class and hide all others ...
[06:07:32] <Cork> sakthi: i can't answer a half question
[06:07:37] <blackkbot> *{visibility:hidden;} div{visiblity:visible;}
[06:07:38] <Cork> give the requested info
[06:08:26] <BillCriswell> sakthi: $('.item').hide().eq(4).show() ?
[06:09:31] <sakthi> <blackkbot>  sry plz tell simple example
[06:10:02] <BillCriswell> lol.
[06:10:26] <sakthi> <BillCriswell> plz tel me any reference page
[06:10:58] <Cork> lol
[06:11:07] <Cork> are you trolling? <_<
[06:11:16] <BillCriswell> You need to know how to perform an action on a group of elements. $('.item').hide(); then you need to know how to just grab one from a collection and do something with it $('.item').eq(2).show();
[06:11:58] <matty_r> Cork: If a td contains a href to an image, how would I display that image in another td?
[06:12:18] <Cork> matty_r: you mean a <a href="">?
[06:12:40] <matty_r> cork: yea mate
[06:12:57] <matty_r> cork: It's part of a longer link, but contains that href
[06:13:07] <Cork> matty_r: either set the url in an <img> tag or as a background image
[06:13:41] <sakthi> <BillCriswell> yes
[06:14:56] <BillCriswell> So we good?
[06:15:55] <matty_r> cork: So, would I use $(this).find('td:nth-child(1):href') .. something like that? i'm just guessing now
[06:16:20] <Cork> matty_r: well no
[06:16:27] <Cork> you most likely need to loop here
[06:16:43] <Cork> so when you do the row work you need
[06:16:50] <phelix> http://www.mindimage.net/ on the last portion at the bottom of the page where I have a floating container om top of the site images. on the top items the floating div stays up even when you move the mouse off of the container. Anyone have an idea what could be causing this?
[06:17:18] <phelix> If it goes to another item it changes just fine but if you go to the item on the far right side of the page and move off of it. It stays open not sure why
[06:17:18] <Cork> you do something like $(target).closest('tr').find('td:nth-child(1) a').attr('href')
[06:17:23] <Cork> matty_r: ^
[06:18:36] <matty_r> cork: hmm ok, i'll give that a go. Whats target in this case?
[06:18:55] <matty_r> cork: just the row from the loop?
[06:19:00] <Cork> no
[06:19:12] <Cork> i thought of it as the target td (for where you want to add the image)
[06:19:20] <matty_r> oh ok
[06:19:22] <Cork> but you haven't given enough info to be fully specific
[06:19:32] <Cork> you could do it from a tr loop
[06:19:42] <matty_r> cork: yea sorry about that, it's on another machine and I can't copy and paste
[06:21:05] <matty_r> cork: would it be easier to implement a mouse over function?
[06:21:18] <Cork> matty_r: most likely no
[06:21:42] <Cork> matty_r: you might want to go that route anyway
[06:22:07] <matty_r> cork: It would probably work alot better, otherwise the table would get all funky
[06:22:19] <Cork> ya, prob
[06:22:41] <Cork> jquery ui might even have most of it implemented for you
[06:22:42] <matty_r> http://codingcyber.com/display-image-jquery-onmouseover-49/ is that likely to help?
[06:22:46] <Cork> (in its tooltip)
[06:23:07] <Cork> matty_r: that would work too
[06:23:43] <matty_r> hmm
[06:24:46] <matty_r> Cork: it would probably work, I just already have an existing table so I'd need to put that code in there somehow
[06:27:16] <BillCriswell> Cork: It sounded like matty_r wanted to put the href value of one td and an img src in a td next to it or something.
[06:27:41] <BillCriswell> s/and/into
[06:28:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: ya, that is what took it as too
[06:28:44] <matty_r> BillCriswell yea thats what I wanted to do. I think it'll be too mess though
[06:28:53] <matty_r> messy*
[06:31:17] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to do like http://css-tricks.com/text-fade-read-more/ -- except it should expand/contract both when clicking on the `More` button and on the body text.
[06:31:19] <matty_r> Cork, BillCriswell: How would I go about adding that mouseover/mouseout function to the existing td? Somehow retrofit it
[06:31:20] <frank_o> Clicking on the body text works fine, but how come it only works the first time with the `More` button? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8ssrmxwp/10/
[06:32:03] <BillCriswell> matty_r: I think I'd be better off starting from the top... Why don't you just have the img in the table from the start?
[06:32:54] <matty_r> BillCriswell: The table contains a list of links to documents
[06:33:10] <matty_r> BillCriswell: I can't change the table directory
[06:33:18] <matty_r> directly*
[06:33:37] <BillCriswell> So are you trying to put the image there, then only show it when you mouse over the tr?
[06:34:43] <matty_r> Basically. It's a link to the image, and rather than have to load a new page to view it i'd prefer to show it on mouse over
[06:35:10] <matty_r> it has an onclick event already which contains the href
[06:36:00] <BillCriswell> In a tooltip or in the table itself?
[06:36:12] <matty_r> In the table itself
[06:36:54] <matty_r> for example <td><a title="" onclick="lots of other stuff then href="http://">
[06:37:35] <BillCriswell> matty_r: http://jsbin.com/qimocehoziqe/1/edit?html,js,output this is how I'd probably approach it.
[06:39:18] <NoiseEee> matty_r: that's all kinds of absurd
[06:39:28] <matty_r> BillCriswell: Nice choice of picture
[06:39:51] <matty_r> BillCriswell: so that just shows the picture in another td on mouse over?
[06:40:29] <BillCriswell> The CSS technically shows the image on hover. The Javascript just puts an image into a td at the start of the row.
[06:40:42] <matty_r> Ah I see the prepend method there
[06:41:05] <matty_r> Ok, i'll try this out
[06:41:53] <BillCriswell> If you needed to put the td at a certain position you'd need to find the one you want it next to and use .before() or .after().
[06:42:02] <matty_r> BillCriswell, I could probably change that so it shows it in a completely different table by itself
[06:42:16] <BillCriswell> matty_r: That sounds a little odd, but sure.
[06:42:47] <matty_r> BillCriswell, well have a dedicated image viewer area kinda thing... I don't know lol
[06:42:56] <BillCriswell> Fair enough.
[06:57:36] <andrea__> helloooo
[06:57:46] * drej waves
[06:58:36] <andrea__> how can i get this timestamp using jquery?   "2014-09-09 15:58:29"
[06:59:11] <Cork> andrea__: jquery doesn't provide any date tools
[06:59:24] <Cork> jquery ui datepicker has some
[06:59:44] <Cork> but you most likely have to either write it yourself or use a third party lib
[07:00:02] <andrea__> thx Cork
[07:01:08] <Brodingo> andrea__ new Date("2014-09-09 15:58:29").getTime()
[07:02:31] <andrea__> Brodingo, thx but i'm using $.now();
[07:03:12] <andrea__> but i need "2014-09-09 15:58:29"
[07:03:46] <Brodingo> ah
[07:05:30] <Nomikos> andrea__: maybe new Date($.now()).toLocaleString()
[07:07:29] <wodim> if i do jQuery("#something").click(function(){}); how do i reference the #something element inside function() ?
[07:07:43] <Cork> wodim: $(this)
[07:07:49] <wodim> thanks
[07:07:53] <wodim> i was just using this
[07:07:55] <wodim> heh
[07:08:04] <wodim> that was not even valid...
[07:08:37] <andrea__> Nomikos: yes but my locale is 9/9/2014 4:06:18 PM, I would like to have this result "2014-09-09 15:58:29"
[07:09:09] <matty_r> how would I shrink the <img> in a <td> I tried <td width=100> but it doesn't resize the image.
[07:09:16] <Nomikos> andrea__: yeahhh.. JS has everything except the one you want. you can build it with %x params though
[07:09:58] <Cork> matty_r: set the width on the img element
[07:10:05] <Nomikos> andrea__: yeahhh.. JS has everything except the one you want. you can build it with %x params though
[07:10:10] <Nomikos> derp
[07:10:14] <Nomikos> (new Date($.now())).toLocaleFormat('%Y-%m-%d %T')   <- that one
[07:10:20] <Cork> matty_r: as in .width on the img element
[07:10:29] <Nomikos> I can't figure out what minutes and seconds are, no doubt it's documented /somewhere/ online..
[07:11:55] <matty_r> cork: ahhhhh ok
[07:12:04] <matty_r> cork: I was doing it on the wrong one
[07:19:38] <fschuindt> Guys, in this example I can't figure out why its printing only the last message repeated. Somebody can help me? http://jsfiddle.net/af0qayhh/
[07:26:38] <Nomikos> fschuindt: everytime you change error['msg'], you're changing the same object, so also all the "copies" of it which are in the errors array already
[07:27:16] <fschuindt> Nomikos: huuum, thank you very much
[07:28:05] <Nomikos> fschuindt: what you could do is re-set the element and msg variables, and push a native object like errors.push({msg: msg, element: element})
[07:28:11] <Nomikos> I'll try to fiddle it..
[07:31:23] <Nomikos> fschuindt: http://jsfiddle.net/af0qayhh/1/
[07:31:44] <Nomikos> fschuindt: I'm not 100% sure about the jQuery elements, you'll have to see if that part workds
[07:31:50] <Nomikos> *works
[07:40:17] <decx> global vars -.-
[08:27:27] <BillCriswell> Dammit. document.activeElement doesn't seem to work on iPhone.
[08:29:37] <BillCriswell> At least how I'm tring to use it.
[09:14:26] <uskerine>  hi, I have the following message: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/opensans/v10/K88....7kw.woff. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.   The application works fine in local development environment,
[09:14:27] <uskerine> any tip on what could be happening?
[10:03:18] <tcon> using jQuery, how can I disable all inputs inside of a form EXCEPT those inside a specific div.class? something like... $('form' :input).not('.class :input').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); ?
[10:03:23] <tcon> but that doesn't seem to work
[10:03:54] <tcon> ..never mind. answered my own question. :)
[10:06:48] <nonconvergent> Okay, why would $('#county').addClass("hidden"); work but $('#county').fadeOut("slow"); would not?
[10:07:53] <jasonmerino> tcon: I believe that the proper way to disabling stuff is with the .prop() method - http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:08:06] <jasonmerino> tcon: in case your self answering wasn't using .prop()
[10:08:11] <jasonmerino> tcon: :)
[10:08:20] <tcon> jasonmerino: yeah it is, unfortunately I'm stuck on some legacy code over here :S
[10:08:31] <jasonmerino> tcon: :/
[10:08:31] <tcon> jasonmerino using 1.5.. yikes
[10:08:45] <jasonmerino> tcon: Yeeesh!
[10:08:53] <jasonmerino> tcon: Alright, well take luck!
[10:09:05] <tcon> jasonmerino: thanks! I need it! haha :)
[10:09:26] <jasonmerino> tcon: Don't worry, I think we've all been there. You'll make it through!
[10:24:54] <tcon> so when I paste this code into the console, it works as desired, however it does not seem to be working when used in a radio .change event..
[10:24:54] <tcon> $('.reportType :input').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[10:36:05] <BillCriswell> tcon: Are you running it on document ready?
[10:36:17] <BillCriswell> tcon: Also, you probably want .prop('disabled', true);
[10:42:40] <tcon> BillCriswell nah on jQuery 1.5, can't use prop unfortunately
[10:42:46] <tcon> but I figured it out, no worries. :)
[10:43:03] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:43:31] <Ceterizine|work> This clients site is so up to date

[11:56:43] <ryorky1> I have the following regex (?<![\d.])(\d{1,2}|\d{0,2}\.\d{1,2})?(?![\d.]) and it will match 7.5, but I need it to match 7.5'    Where do I need to add in my ' to also make it match the single quote?

[12:01:35] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/toymvfjp/1/ is the code ......
[12:07:24] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to acces to a object inside another objects, but I can't. Anyone can help me please? I need to retrieve the "body" value http://jsfiddle.net/a5wg0mdf/
[12:15:47] <lando23> hey guys i was wondering about the behavior of clone() with SVG elements. this fiddle doesn't work like I'd expect: http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/46o0h6ru/3/
[12:17:08] <lando23> here's a simpler test case http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/46o0h6ru/4/
[12:19:32] <Jattenalle> lando23, x and y
[12:19:53] <lando23> oh i need to move it!
[12:19:54] <lando23> ahah
[12:20:20] <Jattenalle> yeah but even moving it i cant get the jsfiddle to work right... but i've had issues with jsfiddle for a while so might just be on my end
[12:20:55] <lando23> isn't there a fancy attr syntax where i can add pixels with attr('x+=15') or something
[12:21:13] <Jattenalle> ziptte is a spambot
[12:21:44] <Jattenalle> ugh, i really need to start remembering who the ops are in here.. freenodes recomendation to hide when you're op is fairly obnoxious
[12:21:56] <lando23> Jattenalle: thanks, that was the soln. http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/46o0h6ru/10/
[12:22:04] <lando23> does that work for you?
[12:22:07] <Jattenalle> lando23, np :) works fine
[12:22:25] <lando23> that's odd that jsfiddle doesn't work for you..
[12:22:51] <Jattenalle> lando23, it's when i change and update, it just.. doesnt.. the textboxes have the new content, but dont run it :/ probably some plugin behaving badly
[12:22:55] <Jattenalle> thanks vladikoff
[12:43:47] <rominronin> hello
[12:43:57] <rominronin> I need some guidance
[12:44:05] <rominronin> I’m hoping to get some help
[12:44:20] <rominronin> I’m planning a one-page ‘web-app’
[12:45:28] <rominronin> users will interact with an image (drag and drop some elements) and click submit. The image (along with the positions of the elements they moved) must be captured and sent as an attachment to the email
[12:46:01] <lando23> rominronin: here's a classic you should read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:46:22] <lando23> (and which i am re-reading right now because it's that good)
[12:46:48] <the8thbit|work> Is there any secret to accessing ids with dots in them?
[12:46:56] <rominronin> got it
[12:46:57] <the8thbit|work> such as #an.id?
[12:47:28] <rominronin> @lando23 thanks.
[12:49:20] <DjMadness> is there any way to create some sort of UUID in jquery/js that would remain the same across sessions and still be different on diff computers etc ? (without cookies etc)
[12:51:14] <ryorky1> if I have the following regex (?<![\d.])(\d{1,2}'|\d{0,2}\.\d{1,2}')?(?![\d.]) which correctly identifies numbers like 15' and 7.5'.  However, it will not work inside a string like thee hight is 15'.  How can I fix it to match inside of a string?
[12:51:57] <BillCriswell> the8thbit|work: You might have to escape the .
[12:52:32] <BillCriswell> Well, not might, do have to.
[12:53:05] <the8thbit|work> would I just put a \ before it to do that, BillCriswell?
[12:53:34] <raul782> Hi guys, is there a way to track changes on an attribute of the  body tag?
[12:53:37] <BillCriswell> the8thbit|work: foo\\.bar
[12:53:45] <the8thbit|work> Thanks bill
[12:53:49] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:54:20] <the8thbit|work> raul782: I just dealt with that problem... I had to sort of hack something together by saving the current value of the attrib and then retrieving it later for comparison
[12:55:07] <raul782> the8thbit|work: Ic, ok thanks will try that,
[12:55:21] <the8thbit|work> raul782: but that was because my particular atrib wasn't copied by .clone()
[12:55:35] <the8thbit|work> if it works for you, it might be easier to clone the whole element and then reference the clone
[12:55:43] <the8thbit|work> unless you're only tracking one atrib
[12:55:46] <the8thbit|work> then it wouldn't matter
[12:55:53] <sniperh4x0r> d
[12:55:54] <raul782> in my case, I'm using a google widget translator that is changing the body tag atrib and messing with the background image
[12:56:35] <the8thbit|work> So you're only touching one atrib, then? I would just do the first thing I said. Cloning the whole body would be overkill
[12:56:48] <krambiorix> hi, if i call a function like $('.input-amount').doSomething(); can i use $(this).parent().remove()   in doSomething() ? Will the parent of all .input-amount elements be removed?
[12:56:50] <raul782> yeah, it makes sense
[12:58:09] <krambiorix> raul782, you talking to me?
[12:59:31] <shoky> krambiorix: it depends what "doSomething" is and how it's coded. e.g. if it's  .each(function() { ... })  then what you said is true
[13:02:28] <krambiorix> shoky, it's a property in a function like $.fn.doSomething = function(){....}
[13:02:43] <shoky> krambiorix: it depends what that .... is exactly.
[13:03:52] <krambiorix> shoky : .... = var cl = $(this).clone(); $(this).parent().remove(); ....
[13:04:29] <shoky> if doSomething doesn't even accept an argument for example.. then you can't even do:  .doSomething( function() { ... } )
[13:05:17] <shoky> (or.. you can, but nothing will be done with that function you passed)
[13:05:31] <krambiorix> shoky , it will accept one argument
[13:07:05] <krambiorix> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/nrsx0jjj/2/
[13:08:19] <shoky> krambiorix: that argument isn't even a function, you'd have to call it from inside addDatePicker..   the way you have it you can only call:  .doSomething(true)  or .doSomething(false)  or .doSomething()
[13:08:33] <shoky> but it won't call your function if you pass a function...
[13:09:12] <shoky> krambiorix: this teaches how to write a proper plugin function that would behave the way you want..  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[13:09:49] <shoky> well actually they don't show how you'd call a callback argument i think
[13:11:45] <krambiorix> shoky, it's not a callback
[13:12:02] <shoky> krambiorix: then how do you expect to call it with a callback argument
[13:12:28] <shoky> krambiorix:  oh you were asking about inside the implementation of doSomething, i see
[13:12:34] <krambiorix> shoky, yes
[13:12:40] <krambiorix> :-)
[13:12:47] <shoky> krambiorix: inside doSomething,  "this"  refers to the jquery collection that .doSomething was called on
[13:13:19] <shoky> so if you call:   $('.bla').doSomething();      then inside doSomething,  "this" will be that jquery object  $('.bla')
[13:13:23] <sifu> hello folks...was wondering how would i append options to a select element rather than the .empty().append(options)?
[13:13:41] <shoky> krambiorix: so yes, this.parent().remove()   will work
[13:14:27] <shoky> krambiorix:  just like calling  $('.bla').parent().remove()  works
[13:14:32] <krambiorix> shoky, but if i have multiple elements with class '.bla'  -> will that still work?
[13:14:50] <shoky> krambiorix:  same as it works  for  $('.bla').parent().remove()  even if $('.bla') returns multiple elements
[13:15:03] <shoky> inside doSomething,   this === $('.bla')
[13:15:21] <krambiorix> shoky, okay
[13:15:24] <krambiorix> shoky, thanks!
[13:15:29] <shoky> np
[13:17:53] <Cork> lol at reading text out of context :D
[13:18:12] <Cork> <shoky> ... this === $('.bla') <-- i went WHAT?!?
[13:18:17] <Cork> then i read the rest XD
[13:18:38] <shoky> lol ;]
[13:22:45] <sniperh4x0r> can someone help me figure out how to get the text-based close button to be in the same location as the image based close button for magnific popup? http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/GAIkt
[13:24:03] <str8uplinux> Why is this firing when i scroll to the top? - It is supposed to fire when i scroll to the bottom. http://pastie.org/9539917 And here is the example: http://nalb.troubleschuett.com/
[13:24:51] <hlvwrk> dumb question, what would be the best way to do a check to see if the last character in an input is a period?
[13:25:01] <str8uplinux> could it have something to do with the nav bar?
[13:26:16] <Cork> hlvwrk: .test(/\.$/)
[13:26:50] <Cork> opps sorry other way around
[13:27:12] <Cork> /\.$/.test(input)
[13:27:49] <hlvwrk> o_O?
[13:28:07] <hlvwrk> I'm basically trying to add an if element contains a period at the end, trim the period.
[13:28:28] <hlvwrk> becuase chrome be stupid, and doesn't validate input type numbers the same as firefox
[13:28:29] <hlvwrk> >_>
[13:31:52] <Cork> hlvwrk: then the simplest is to just remove the dot if it is there
[13:32:27] <Cork> hlvwrk: $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/\.$/, ''));
[13:32:51] <hlvwrk> that won't replace decimals within the input, just the trailing, correct?
[13:32:58] <Cork> no need for an if statement
[13:33:07] <Cork> $ is end of input
[13:33:17] <Cork> so yes only when . is the last character
[13:34:04] <Aswebb> are there cloudflare users?
[13:34:38] <hlvwrk> hm
[13:35:19] <krambiorix> shoky, can i loop with $(this) inside the function?
[13:36:32] <Cork> krambiorix: this.each if that is what you mean
[13:36:38] <Cork> no need for $()
[13:37:01] <Cork> and yes plugins is always suppose to use this.each around there code
[13:38:30] <krambiorix> Cork, so if this ( which is actually $('input') ...) has multiple elements in the collection (multiple input fields) , i can loop through it?
[13:38:40] <hlvwrk> ehhh
[13:39:07] <Cork> krambiorix: just like you can loop with $('input').each
[13:40:23] <krambiorix> Cork okay great , thanks!
[13:43:58] <nonconvergent> Maybe you guys know.  Fairly large project, spring/jsp and js and jquery mixed together all over the place.  Trying to find why when I click on an input button it triggers twice. (I suspected it and then confirmed it with an alert and a incrementing global.)
[13:44:15] <hlvwrk> didn't end up working Cork
[13:44:16] <hlvwrk> :(
[13:46:27] <Jattenalle> nonconvergent, most likely because you add .click() to the same element multiple times, especially if you clone them
[13:48:05] <Cork> hlvwrk: ok?
[13:48:13] <Cork> define "not working"
[13:48:26] <nonconvergent> Jattenalle: I've tried searching the project for that element's DOM id, and only found it on the same page (so it's unique)
[13:48:30] <nonconvergent> at least.
[13:48:41] <Jattenalle> nonconvergent, yeah but say the element is a <button>
[13:48:47] <Jattenalle> you add .click for it via id
[13:48:55] <Jattenalle> then another thing adds .click for all buttons
[13:50:12] <hlvwrk> cork, I'm trying to fiddle it. sec.
[13:53:24] <gaius65> Is there a method to retrieve the currently on the element set style="height :X"?
[13:53:58] <gaius65> $(el).css('height') returns the calculated height, not the css value
[13:55:39] <Cork> gaius65: no you most likely have to parse the style tag
[13:56:00] <Cork> gaius65: though there are plenty of ways to get away from that
[13:56:18] <Cork> hard to tell what without context though
[13:57:22] <gaius65> Cork: Context is that the following plugin forces a redraw an then should set the initial value. So I want to change this lines: https://github.com/weblinc/jquery.smoothState.js/blob/master/jquery.smoothState.js#L278
[13:59:09] <Cork> gaius65: well, best is prob to just have it set css('height', '')
[13:59:20] <Cork> gaius65: and control the height from css (not in style="")
[13:59:36] <Cork> then it would reset it to the initial value
[13:59:58] <gaius65> Cork: I totally agree. But since this is a general purpose plugin I have to help developers finding this issue
[14:00:15] <Cork> gaius65: eeh...
[14:00:20] <gaius65> Cork: But if there isn't already a function I'll just add debug output
[14:00:24] <Cork> well then you have to regex parse the style attribute...
[14:00:57] <Cork> gaius65: another option is to animate the max/min-height instead
[14:01:05] <Cork> then you don't have to touch the height value at all
[14:01:26] <gaius65> You mena force a redraw through min-height?
[14:01:36] <gaius65> …max-height?
[14:01:47] <Cork> so you just want to trigger a redraw?
[14:02:01] <Cork> no value change?
[14:02:07] <gaius65> Cork: It's not my library, but yes
[14:02:17] <Cork> then all you need is $element.height()
[14:02:36] <Cork> that will trigger a reflow
[14:02:49] <lundy> after using .html(""); how can I refresh the styles inside it? im using JQuery UI
[14:02:51] <Cork> no need to modify the value
[14:03:07] <Cork> lundy: inside what?
[14:03:20] <Cork> also use .empty() instead of .html("")
[14:03:37] <gaius65> Cork: the height function gets the computed height, but if the element was already rendered before it would not redraw it!?
[14:03:42] <lundy> Cork im using this
[14:03:45] <lundy>  $test.replaceWith($('<div data-role="header" data-theme="d" class="borderbtm" id="btn-page">').html(new_title));
[14:04:13] <Cork> gaius65: .height() is to trigger the browser to recalculate the frame tree
[14:04:17] <lundy> but it doesnt style correctly, I tried adding .trigger("refresh"); onto the end off it but it never worked
[14:04:31] <gaius65> Cork: Why recalcualte?
[14:04:34] <Cork> gaius65: and if the browser detects changes it redraws
[14:04:44] <gaius65> Cork: Yes!
[14:04:45] <Cork> gaius65: cause that is what triggers a redraw
[14:05:01] <gaius65> Cork: But as I understood the library the goal is to redraw, even if there weren't changes
[14:05:17] <Cork> gaius65: dom doesn't work like that
[14:05:58] <lundy> Cork, im replacing a FORM with a div ... but the styles in the div I replace doesnt work
[14:06:27] <Cork> lundy: make sure the css rules match the element
[14:06:54] <lundy> Yeah it does
[14:07:15] <Cork> then the styling should work
[14:08:06] <lundy> Cork, from what iv been googling its something to do with the Mobile Style not refreshing when dynamically changing it ...
[14:08:17] <lundy> everything has said like to use trigger("refresh");
[14:08:22] <lundy> but that doesnt seem to work for me
[14:08:28] <Cork> ah, jqm?
[14:08:56] <lundy> yes
[14:09:03] <Cork> ah, that explains a lot
[14:09:18] <Cork> ya, jqm does some js modifications to the dom
[14:09:26] <lundy> uhuh
[14:09:31] <gaius65> Cork: Ok, I don't know the reasons behind the redraw of the plugin, so I can not add much here. I'll open in issue and talk to the maker ;-)
[14:09:53] <lundy> Cork, any solution to this?
[14:12:07] <Cork> lundy: i'm not good enough at jqm
[14:12:33] <Cork> it has a developing model i don't like so i don't use it much
[14:13:14] <lundy> ah ok :) no problems, ill keep googling on here :)
[14:13:42] <lundy> everything iv been reading is just all for LISTS and that but nothing for what im looking for
[14:15:30] <erisco> in ie9 when I make an ajax request nothing happens. no error message, no log that a request was sent
[14:15:35] <erisco> no data returned
[14:15:56] <Cork> erisco: same domain?
[14:16:00] <erisco> no
[14:16:08] <Cork> a post call?
[14:16:28] <erisco> GET
[14:17:56] <Cork> erisco: do you have the plugin that teaches jquery to use ms XDomainRequest?
[14:18:06] <erisco> no idea
[14:18:13] <Cork> as xhr in ie can't do cors
[14:18:24] <erisco> well it works in IE 10 and IE 11
[14:18:33] <erisco> is it just IE 9 and below that cannot?
[14:18:50] <Cork> ie8 doens't have XDomainRequest if i remember correctly
[14:18:58] <Cork> or sorry
[14:19:04] <Cork> XDomainRequest is ie8 and 9
[14:19:23] <erisco> I would at least expect an error if it could not do cors
[14:19:31] <Cork> and yes xhr supports cors in ie10+
[14:19:55] <Cork> http://caniuse.com/cors
[14:21:04] <erisco> so it looks like I'd have to proxy off the server
[14:21:34] <Cork> ya
[14:21:45] <Cork> some older iphones doesn't support cors either
[14:21:49] <Cork> so you prob want it anyway
[14:22:57] <snover> uh, CORS is supported in iOS since at least 3.2…
[14:27:01] <Cork> snover: ya, i think it was 3 or something like that
[14:27:13] <Cork> it bit me a little while back
[14:28:35] <Cork> and by 3 i meant iphone 3
[14:36:02] <erisco> ugh I dunno
[14:36:11] <erisco> I install this plugin https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest but still nothing happens
[14:36:25] <erisco> I set contentType to 'text/plain' and type to 'GET'
[15:21:22] <frothnicator> I'm loading jquery-hotkeys.js, and then attempting to bind two functions to two different keystrokes.  (e.g. http://jsbin.com/nejobogagofo/1/edit ).  Unfortunately, as that link shows, if you touch the Esc key or backtick [`], both functions get called, regardless.  Is there something obvious I'm missing in how I use jquery-hotkeys?
[15:26:44] <str8uplinux> any reason this scroll function is firing at the top of my page instead of at the bottom as intended? http://pastie.org/9540140 Example: nalb.troubleschuett.com
[15:59:40] <yoshie902a> I have the following Jquery.fileupload code and I’d like to add a fade remove after the upload is done. Can some one help recommend how to do this? I’m new to Javascript and JQuery.  http://pastie.org/9540258
[16:00:30] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: I've use fadeOut: http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/
[16:02:20] <yoshie902a> frothnicator: Thanks, I am famiiiar with the fadeout() method, but I am confused as to how to integrate it into the code I already have.  It would help to understand my code a bit more. I got it from a railscasts
[16:03:19] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: yeah, if you don't understand your code, that's a necessary first step for you to fix.
[16:03:25] <yoshie902a> I understand calling a method on an object, like $().method.  However, when it starts doing stuff like add: (e,data) -> I’m getting a bit lost
[16:04:06] <yoshie902a> frothnicator: I agree, would you be kind enough to help me understand it a bit more?
[16:04:31] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: well, I don't directly understand that dialect.  It's not javascript.  Is that Coffeescript?
[16:05:00] <yoshie902a> Oh, you know what I think it is.
[16:05:08] <frothnicator> I assume (e, data) -> is an anonymous function that takes two arguments.
[16:05:48] <frothnicator> add: ... then assigns that anonymous function so that it can be called like obj.add(someE, somedata)
[16:10:00] <yoshie902a> frothnicator: I’m thinking I need to add fadeout() function added to data.context = $(tmpl("template-upload", file)).fadeout(), but it give me an error, any ideas?
[16:10:48] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: well, what does the error message say?
[16:11:32] <yoshie902a> TypeError: $(...).fadeout is not a function
[16:11:37] <frothnicator> $(...) is the jquery selector.  I suspect that tmpl(...) does not return a DOM element.
[16:12:28] <frothnicator> You say you want to fadeout the element when the submit is complete?  Or just executed?  If so, you might see if .submit supports the Promise API.
[16:12:49] <frothnicator> then you could do .submit().done( $('#yourelement').fadeOut() );
[16:13:44] <gnarf> yoshie902a: fadeOut ?
[16:14:14] <gnarf> case sensitive
[16:14:31] <yoshie902a> gnarf: good to know! thanks!
[16:14:41] <yoshie902a> frothnicator: Good recommendation, i’m trying it now
[16:15:36] <gnarf> also, submit does not return a promise
[16:15:43] <gnarf> no need to look
[16:16:05] <gnarf> in fact, .submit() on a form will reload the whole page if you let it go through and aren't ajaxing it
[16:16:43] <yoshie902a> gnarf: I’m ajaxing it
[16:16:45] <yoshie902a> :)
[16:16:59] <gnarf> then drop it on the end of your ajax promise
[16:18:24] <yoshie902a> I added         data.submit().done( $('#document').fadeOut() );, I receive no error, but nothing is different either, it’s not fading out
[16:22:27] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: that's what gnarf was saying, I believe, that submit is not the right function: it does not implement the promise API.
[16:23:03] <yoshie902a> what is the promise API, I’m sorry for my ignorance.
[16:26:20] <shoky> frothnicator: bit late but in case you're still having trouble, the problem with your jsbin was that it's linking to github directly
[16:28:04] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: Google it?
[16:28:12] <frothnicator> yoshie902a: you can also sink you teeth into this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
[16:28:55] <shoky> that's ES6 promises, not jquery
[16:33:15] <yoshie902a> reading about it
[17:19:23] <Admin_> does anyone know why the following wont fire when a key is pressed in a google apps script
[17:19:25] <Admin_> $(document).on('keyup',function(e){alert('test');});
[17:22:27] <^ScRAsH^> HI
[17:22:40] <Admin_> $(document).on('keypress','body',function(e) {
[17:22:40] <Admin_>  doesnt work either
[17:22:58] <^ScRAsH^> Somebody knows how to validate a form, from client side... something as isFormValid()?
[17:23:30] <Admin_> any ideas??
[17:23:32] <^ScRAsH^> with jQuery
[18:07:16] <Jagst3r21> is there any way to strip all non-letters from a textarea on submission?
[18:07:58] <Jagst3r21> regex I think?
[18:09:28] * Nomikos nods
[18:15:45] <Jagst3r21> Nomikos the question now is which is more efficient (in terms of toll on the serveer): doing it via php or jQuery/JS...
[18:16:37] <Jagst3r21> I know it can be done via php as well, using ereg_replace or something..
[18:17:07] <Jagst3r21> nvm ereg_replace is deprecated
[18:17:13] <Nomikos> Jagst3r21: uhm.. it should take milliseconds at most. client will be less toll on server, but if it's /important/ then you should do it on the server [too] anyway
[18:17:28] <Jagst3r21> k
[18:17:28] <Nomikos> "don't trust user input"
[18:17:30] <Jagst3r21> thanks
[18:18:55] <Nomikos> Jagst3r21: for php it's  preg_replace('/[^a-z]/i', '', $user_input);
[18:18:59] <Nomikos> for example
[18:19:15] <Jagst3r21> thnx!
[20:23:13] <hwamokp66>  http://ideahatch.org/alternate.html how come i can't click the youtube video to play?
[20:24:02] <rubblebath> what am I missing here, shouldn't this work? https://ghostbin.com/paste/bp5yn
[20:24:16] <rubblebath> my php file is spitting out valid JSON, I know because if I manually copy and paste the output it works
[20:36:47] <BillCriswell> rubblebath: You should put what you have in the second document ready in the callback for the getJSON
[20:37:09] <BillCriswell> rubblebath: Right now you can't guarantee company_list is ready when you need it.
[20:38:55] <BillCriswell> rubblebath: http://pastie.org/pastes/9540629/text would be how I do it.
[20:40:00] <rubblebath> BillCriswell, thanks, I'm still making transition from procedural to async thinking...
[20:40:30] <BillCriswell> Understood completely. Big jump.
[20:47:00] <icedburg> anyone here used masonry?
[21:17:16] <HarbingTarbl> I've got a firefox specific problem with $.get() and plain text data. Firefox keeps throwing "syntax error" messages when I use $.get(), even after setting the dataType to "text". Any ideas?
[21:20:23] <HarbingTarbl> http://jsbin.com/fiwayovasowi/1/edit is the current code
[21:22:27] <Mega> ^__^ hi guys!! let's say i have a div.my-class and i execute $('.my-class') and if there is no any DOM-elements actually i get just [] could somebody tell me please which way is correct to check whether there is an DOM-element or not?
[21:32:15] <znf> Would anyone know why calling something like $(this).prev('input').val(''); works just fine if I call the function via a mouse click, but not when pressing escape?
[21:35:20] <Mega> i found solution for my Q. just do "if ( $('.my-class').length ) it means that there is at least one element with .my-class in the DOM
[21:39:13] <Mega> znf: could you tell me which events binding are you use for this code? focusout?
[21:39:37] <znf> Mega, .keyup()
[21:40:05] <znf> You can see it in action here: http://c.n-zone.ro/ on the search field
[21:40:22] <znf> Surprisingly, it only works as I expected in... IE11 :-|
[21:40:28] <sakthi> plz tell me  slider show and hide function but i want one element default open and other elements hide
[21:43:41] <Mega> znf: but in my chrome 37.0.2062.120 it works perfectly, just reset search criterias with mouse click or Esc, except one thing, when i press Esc, the value of input still here
[21:43:55] <znf> Mega, that's what I mean... :)
[21:44:36] <znf> oh great, in opera it doesn't work at all... it just unfocuses my field
[21:46:13] <mdev> how can i edit contents of a tables <td>'s, html looks like <tr id="blah"><td></td><td></td></tr>
[21:50:17] <znf> $('tr#blah td').first().val('something')
[21:53:47] <icedburg> anyone used masonry for a grid layout and encountered the wide-screen column breaking issue in safari?
[21:56:03] <mdev> good stuff thanks znf
[22:05:46] <mdev> lol can you just keep adding dots?
[22:06:01] <mdev> $('#blah').closest('tr').find('td').hide().html('test').css( "background-color", "red" ).fadeIn(1000);
[22:06:08] <mdev> apparently that works
[22:06:12] <mdev> pretty lawl
[22:09:07] <sakthi> plz tell me  slider show and hide function but i want one element default open and other elements hide
[22:10:24] <scott0101> hey, Im looking to select a button that has a data-invalid attribute, it has no id
[22:22:27] <Uhkis> mdev: all of those functions return a jquery object so you can chain it
[22:22:43] <Uhkis> ziptte is a spambot btw
[22:26:13] <mdev> jquery is so much awesome
[22:26:27] <mdev> makes js stuff so much easier than raw js
[22:26:34] <mdev> and so many neat addons too
[22:27:20] <tw2113> 50mil sliders!
[22:29:27] <Uhkis> mdev: yup, jquery is full of awesome
[22:32:31] <scott0101> hey, I have $(this).find('[data-invalid]') which returns an input and a button (with no ID)
[22:32:39] <scott0101> how can I select the button?
[23:02:40] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[23:06:57] <jaccob> I'm doing .parent().parent().parent().parent().remove() is that alright, or is it stupid and there is a much better way?
[23:07:19] <Cork> jaccob: .closest('selector').remove()
[23:07:31] <jaccob> Cork, thx a million
[23:25:38] <matty_r> good evening all :)
[23:37:38] <disappearedng_> https://gist.github.com/vicngtor/357d020d53a4a0ad52b2 anyone here knows why this is not validating?
[23:38:30] <Cork> validating?
[23:38:42] <Cork> ah the bootstrap
[23:39:14] <Cork> disappearedng_: not from a code dump, you could try making a fiddle if you like
[23:52:50] <neredsenvy> I have a function that adjusts position of a div object when document is ready $(document).ready(...); But I also have to write same code for $(document).resize(...); is there a way to merge this ? So I don't have duplicate code ? like $(document).on("ready,resize", function(){..}); ?
[23:54:18] <neredsenvy> I tried .on("ready, resize" .. ) and .on("ready|resize" .. ) no go here
[23:55:30] <Cork> neredsenvy: write a named function and pass the name to the different calls
[23:55:50] <Cork> function handler() {} $(document).ready(handler).resize(handler);
