[00:05:21] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[00:07:28] <ruby_on_tails> http://pastebin.com/iKCTh4Wu how can i simplify/reduce this code? i feel it can be done with lesser code
[00:07:47] <ruby_on_tails> the code simply targets spans with html = a space and replaces it with &nbsp;
[00:20:48] <jphase> ruby_on_tails: do you need to replace all spaces or just the first occurrence?
[00:22:30] <ruby_on_tails> jphase: the elements i am targetting only have just one space nothing else
[00:22:48] <ruby_on_tails> it comes from splitting a sentence the space between the words get wrapped up in span like that
[00:23:29] <jphase> $('.keyword').each(function(){ $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/ +?/g, '&nbsp;')); });   <--  that would replace all spaces
[00:23:46] <jphase> $('.keyword').each(function(){ $(this).html($(this).html().replace(' ', '&nbsp;')); });   <--  that would replace just the first
[00:25:10] <ruby_on_tails> jphase: hmm anyway i could simplify the looping over each .keyword?
[00:25:41] <ruby_on_tails> something like $("magic selector to catch elements with ' ' html").html("&nbsp"); ?
[00:29:01] <jphase> well you'll need a reference to the html of the matched element to replace it
[00:29:24] <jphase> hm
[00:30:00] <jphase> you can select them
[00:30:09] <jphase> but you have to replace the content so you'll need to iterate
[00:30:36] <jphase> is their content only ' ' and nothing else?'
[00:31:28] <jphase> cause if it's just a space and nothing else you can do $('.keyword:contains( )').html('&nbsp;');
[00:31:40] <jphase> or if you're replacing their entire contents rather
[01:38:47] <zagaza`> hi guys.. best way to preload a page? aka showing a preloader until the page finished loading
[01:42:01] <jphase> zagaza`: I usually just stick a div over the top of everything with my animation and then fade it out on window load
[01:48:33] <zagaza`> jphase: that doesn't sound bad.. what is really window load? does it recognize when all the content has been loaded?
[01:48:45] <jphase> yep
[01:49:01] <zagaza`> hmm interesting
[01:49:32] <zagaza`> got any reference by chance? a small tutorial anywhere? quite too new to javascript :)
[01:52:13] <jphase> oh, well literally it'd just be a few lines, I can mock one up for you on jsfiddle....
[01:52:32] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=lkVtoLSrcb
[01:52:46] <zagaza`> thanks mate
[01:54:02] <Tekla> can i do something like this? [var1, var2, var3] = msg.split('delimiter'); ?
[02:04:37] <jphase> Tekla: no that's more like python
[02:05:38] <jphase> you can declare them in one line or loop through the results and use variable variables though
[02:06:08] <jphase> oh that's php, nvm lol
[02:06:10] <jphase> it's late
[02:06:32] <jphase> you could use eval though if you had several iterations
[02:19:48] <zagaza`> jphase: that didn't work for me so I downloaded requirejs domReady plugin.. works quite similar checkout the code on jsfiddle
[02:20:28] <zagaza`> or u are not there anymore.. but http://danielnikolovski.com
[02:24:14] <zagaza`> anyways thanks for the help jphase
[02:34:57] <jl2753> Hi everyone. I'm trying gradually lower opacity of a fixed element until it's invisible by the time the next section reaches the element but not sure how to proceed. http://jsfiddle.net/vhYpZ/
[02:35:45] <jl2753> I managed to make it fadeOut(), but that's not what I'm looking for. Should I be calculating the remaining pixels to element and making a loop that decreases opacity?
[02:42:39] <zagaza`> jl2753: interesting, I am a noob at this but what exactly do you want to accomplish? gradually decreasing opacity until it reaches the green, and when it reaches the green make it invisible?
[02:44:01] <Polar_> jl2753: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/vhYpZ/1/
[02:44:37] <Polar_> the math part is up to you, wasnt sure when you want it to fade
[02:45:48] <zagaza`> Polar_: just curious, why /100 after scrolltop?
[02:46:02] <Polar_> opacity is from 0 to 1
[02:46:13] <Polar_> or well 0.0 to 1
[02:50:18] <jl2753> Polar: that's fantastic. thank you!
[02:50:27] <jl2753> Polar_: that's fantastic. thank you!
[03:13:23] <Rhomber> in jquery mobile (1.4) any tips on how to center text in a listview item?
[03:17:06] <Shnilj> Might be a retarded question, but can't you just do that with css?
[03:18:08] <Rhomber> dw, fixed it out :)
[03:18:22] <Shnilj> try: .ui-listview .ui-li { text-align: center; }
[03:18:25] <Shnilj> ah, ok :D
[03:18:27] <Rhomber> and yeah, but I couldn't work out how.. I need !important (it wasn't reflecting
[03:18:58] <Rhomber> .nav-header a { text-align: center !important; padding-left: 0px !important; }
[03:19:07] <Rhomber> now it's centered nicely regardless of it's icon too :)
[03:19:57] <clime> Hey, I have the following problem. <a href="/" data-xyz='&lt;'>foobar</a>  Now if I call $('a').data('xyz') it returns '<'  instead o '&lt;' is there a way to get the raw value
[03:20:25] <Shnilj> Just as a test, try adding .nav-header .list-view a { text-align: center; } and comment out the code you just pasted
[03:20:31] <Shnilj> Does that work?
[03:23:37] <Rhomber> Shnilj: will try :)
[03:26:42] <Rhomber> nope.. neither did.. .ui-listview .nav-header a {
[03:26:53] <Rhomber> nav-header is on the li
[03:27:55] <Shnilj> Oh ok :) Just experimenting. It's not wrong to use !important in your code, but it is sometimes wise to, given you have the time to do so, check WHY you needed to have !important in your code
[03:28:17] <Rhomber> .ui-listview li.nav-header a {  worked :)
[03:28:27] <Shnilj> huzzah!
[03:28:43] <Rhomber> and yeah, you are right.. was just being lazy through frustration I guess
[03:28:48] <Rhomber> I don't like CSS.. lol
[03:29:26] <Shnilj> No worries ;) I also use !important and such in my code if I have no time or am getting frustrated ;)
[03:29:43] <Rhomber> haha :)
[03:29:48] <Shnilj> But it's also interesting to sometimes check why you needed it.. Learning experience and all :D
[03:30:13] <Shnilj> Also, Clime, why would you want '$lt;' and not '<' to be returned?
[03:30:34] <Rhomber> yep! for sure
[03:32:01] <Shnilj> But I'm glad you found the solution!
[03:32:15] <Shnilj> CSS can be a frustrating thing sometimes, just hang in there mate
[03:32:33] <clime> Shnilj: cause the string that I store in data attribute is actually:  '<a href="/somepath">&lt;button&gt;name&lt;/button&gt;</a>' and I get returned '<a href="/somepath"><button>name</button></a>'
[03:33:19] <clime> Shnilj: but I am already doing it differently.
[03:35:30] <clime> in the previous case my backend escaping was getting lost so I need to find another way
[03:35:30] <Rhomber> anyone have experience with preloading in jquery mobile 1.4?
[03:35:48] <Rhomber> it seems to keep loading a page anyway, even though I prefetch it with start up code..
[03:35:50] <clime> I didn't find the way to get "raw" data value
[03:37:38] <Shnilj> clime: I searched around a little and couldn't find it either
[03:37:56] <clime> Shnilj: ye, I'll "workaround" it, thx
[03:38:52] <Shnilj> Didn't do anything really, so no worries ;)
[03:39:03] <Shnilj> Also, how do you do the 'mention' thing? *ashamed*
[03:39:42] <decx> i'm pretty sure you'll have to write &amp;lt; to preserve a fake entity
[03:42:42] <Rhomber> $.mobile.page.prototype.options.domCache = true;  seems to do the opposite.. the page that wasn't loading every request is now loading every request.. lol
[03:44:28] <Shnilj> Not enough experience with jQuery mobile to help you, mate.. Sorry
[04:11:15] <Dirkos> Is there a way to get the entity index of everything with a specified class?
[04:11:43] <systemfault> What is an entity index?
[04:15:10] <Dirkos> systemfault: .index()
[04:15:32] <Dirkos> $(this).index() gives me the correct index but i only want the index of all elements with class "active"
[04:15:46] <Dirkos> can do it with an each though but was wondering if .index() as an option for that too
[04:55:09] <jillesme> Anyone with experience with jscroll?
[04:56:25] <HD|Laptop> Hi all
[04:56:55] <HD|Laptop> I have in $(document).ready event handler the line $("#x").focus().keyup(function()...);
[04:57:05] <HD|Laptop> the keyup handler works fine so the selector is ok
[04:57:16] <HD|Laptop> but on pageload the box does not focus, why?
[04:57:34] <HD|Laptop> jquery is 2.1.0, only tested browser so far is chrome
[04:58:36] <HD|Laptop> is it possible that this is due to the input not being inside a form tag?
[04:58:45] <Shinoks> chrome sucks
[04:59:59] <Baako> hello guy sjust got a question please. I am trying to great download link which using php and jquery. The jquery will use the value in the select option and sent to php and php looks at the "doc" folder for that file and then download it into the user php. in the php i have done this http://pastebin.com/7ERCDPXc  but in the select option do i http://pastebin.com/wqnttGse like use "getval();"
[05:00:16] <HD|Laptop> yeah but ff is dead slow on a netbook and IE, well lets not talk about IE
[05:03:10] <seutje> Baako: so what about that question?
[05:03:30] <Baako> seutje ?
[05:03:54] <seutje> Baako: you stated you have a question, let's hear it!
[05:05:31] <Baako> seutje so do i use "getval();" is they another a specicfy function what is used to say this is might to be a download file
[05:06:23] <seutje> Baako: not entirely sure what you mena, but getval is not a standardized api function
[05:07:53] <Baako> seutje okay so i need to say in the option value="file.pdf" so use make sure that all option has the extension in the value
[05:08:46] <seutje> if you want to validate the input, jQuery.validate is a pretty popular solution
[05:09:02] <Shnilj> or Parsley
[05:10:00] <jillesme> Or write your own validation engine
[05:10:00] <Baako> setuje php is already doing the validation dont see the need to do it client side aswell
[05:10:40] <seutje> guess I misinterpreted "make sure that all option has the extension in the value"
[05:11:37] <jillesme> Can I map :ft php, or :ft css to :set ft=***?
[05:12:27] <seutje> jillesme: like, as a string?
[05:12:43] <jillesme> Oh, I wanted to post that to #vim, sorry guys :p
[05:12:48] <Baako> seutje for example lets say you choose to download a pdf file called "jquery.pdf" in the select option i will have <option value="jquery.pdf>  instead of just having <option value="jquery">
[05:12:50] <seutje> ooh
[05:13:29] <seutje> Baako: labels are independent from values anyway, so go for it
[05:13:53] <seutje> still not sure what the actual issue is though
[05:31:05] <Baako> http://pastebin.com/mdHbXN5N  what wrong with this? getting a stupid error "$" is not defined
[05:31:24] <Baako> the error is referred to $(document).ready(function() {
[05:33:21] <Baako> i have referce it in html <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src ="js/download.js"></script>
[05:38:10] <msafi> I have <div><span></span></div> with an on('click') registered on the div, but this onclick doesn't seem to fire when I click on the span…any idea why?
[05:44:55] <FrEaKmAn_> when using $.ajax and when I get 400 error, it is possible to get response content?
[05:45:37] <FrEaKmAn_> ah, xhr.responseText
[06:17:03] <clime> Hey, I am renderring json into html (in <script></script>). However I am getting javascript error (Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL     jquery-1.10.2.min.js:4) because description field contains <script></script> tags from an evil user. Here is the piece of code that produces the js error: https://dpaste.de/JGA7. How to safely render json into html?
[06:24:31] <MikeD_> does IE8 understand first level descendant selector?
[06:25:05] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: > ?
[06:25:09] <MikeD_> yes
[06:25:17] <BillCriswell> It should. It's been around a long ass time.
[06:25:40] <MikeD_> so have i :p   I'm still scarred by IE6
[06:28:03] <BillCriswell> I don't say that word.
[06:29:10] <MikeD_> ha, ok... it'll be a 'look' that those of us old enough to remember will just know
[06:29:50] <BillCriswell> If I had to go back to debugging for that and IE5. I'd honestly never build a website again.
[06:30:14] <BillCriswell> Not being sarcastic. I'd quit.
[06:35:44] <MikeD_> Yeah, landscaping can't be _that_ bad... or bartending... or (IE5??) hobo
[06:36:32] <Mindblighter> IE8 is actually not that bad. usually supporting it fairly trivial as long as you beat what HTML5 elements are into it
[06:36:39] <Mindblighter> *is fairly trivial
[06:37:05] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to work around this issue? https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/173
[06:40:20] <krambiorix> hi, i use popover to show some info depending on a table row. I try: $('.popovertarget').popover({delay:1000,trigger:'hover',content:$(this).attr('id'),placement:'top'}); but i don't see the popup. When i use content:'blabla' -> all works... Anyone any idea?
[06:41:06] <BillCriswell> Mindblighter: Yeah, I have no problem supporting even 7 if it's absolutely required. 6 and back though, no god damn way.
[06:49:59] <Shnilj> krambiorix: $(this) doesn't seem to work in this situation. Try $('.popovertarget').attr('id') as content maybe,
[06:50:00] <Shnilj> ?
[06:52:07] <seutje> krambiorix: u'll prolly need to loop over them to create a separate scope for the ID, like $('.popovertarget').each(function() { $(this).popover({delay:1000,trigger:'hover',content:this.id,placement:'top'}); })
[06:52:18] <seutje> as you don't wanna end up passing the ID of the first result to all of them, right?
[06:53:05] <seutje> alternatively, you could just use a regular for loop and gain maybe a couple ms
[07:03:44] <Shnilj> krambiorix: you can also set your content like this -> content: function() {
[07:04:03] <Shnilj> return $(this).attr('id')},
[07:04:21] <seutje> oh shit yeah
[07:04:24] <seutje> even better!
[07:04:34] <seutje> but I'd use this.id instead of wrapping it in a jQuery
[07:04:53] <seutje> it's like the safest proptribute
[07:05:08] <BillCriswell>  Haha.
[07:05:11] <BillCriswell> properbute
[07:05:19] <BillCriswell> attriber
[07:05:29] <BillCriswell> attriberty has a nice ring to it.
[07:05:42] <seutje> attriberty rly works, yeah
[07:05:52] <seutje> proptribute sounds like... a tribute
[07:06:42] <BillCriswell> Yeah, not sure what I was thinking there.
[07:06:46] <Shnilj> sorry, what's a proptribute? :p
[07:07:12] <BillCriswell> Shnilj: It's kind of annoying telling the difference between a property and attribute, so he combined them.
[07:07:30] <krambiorix> seutje, Shnilj  thanks!!
[07:07:46] <Shnilj> BillCriswell: AHA!
[07:07:49] <BillCriswell> It doesn't matter too often, but when it does it'll ruin your day.
[07:07:59] <Shnilj> krambiorix: No worries :)
[07:09:57] <fattest> i have a question with php that involves javascript , can i ask here?
[07:15:04] <BillCriswell> It depends where the problem is fattest.
[07:19:33] <BillCriswell> fattest: I mean, I'd go for it, then we can let you know haha.
[07:21:29] <fattest> BillCriswell: I have a simple modal, which opens when the form is submitted. I want the page to redirect to a test page which I created, that holds sleep (10) ( http://google.fhost.us/wait.php ). How can I show the modal while the page is still loading? http://codepad.viper-7.com/5VMXts
[07:23:10] <BillCriswell> fattest: So the script sleeps for 10 before it sends any content, right?
[07:23:46] <fattest> BillCriswell: this page http://google.fhost.us/wait.php will sleep for 10 seconds and then will show content
[07:24:00] <fattest> i'm trying to redirect to that page, so while the page is loading (for 10 seconds) i want the modal to show
[07:25:34] <BillCriswell> fattest: There's a method in $.ajax called beforeSend where you start when they submit the form and in the success you can hide it again.
[07:26:14] <fattest> i'll have a look into it
[07:26:17] <fattest> thank you so much
[07:27:03] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:41:45] <kiki67100> Hello everybody
[07:42:23] <kiki67100> It's possible with jQuery or pure javascript to show % of download file ?
[08:09:00] <ClassDude> Im trying to assign a click event handler on an element with multiple classes based on the first class, but it doesnt seem to work.. Is it possible?
[08:09:45] <BillCriswell> ClassDude: So... .foo.bar is ok but .bar.foo is not?
[08:10:07] <ClassDude> No, not what I meant :p
[08:10:23] <ClassDude> element has class='firstclass secondclass'
[08:10:34] <ClassDude> i want to select the element with $('.firstclass')
[08:10:34] <BillCriswell> Right.
[08:10:48] <BillCriswell> Right.
[08:10:52] <ClassDude> Rather, I want to select all elements with firstclass
[08:11:04] <ClassDude> and add click handler to them
[08:11:10] <BillCriswell> You got it.
[08:11:15] <michelem> hello folks
[08:11:18] <BillCriswell> $('.firstclass') would be fin.
[08:11:40] <ClassDude> Well, it wont work :/
[08:11:48] <BillCriswell> I assure you it works.
[08:11:58] <michelem> I have a colorbox that loads its initial content from an HTTP req. How can I slide another form, also to be loaded, into this colorbox?
[08:12:28] <BillCriswell> ClassDude: http://jsbin.com/gokunika/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:12:31] <ClassDude> Well, not on my end :(
[08:12:42] <BillCriswell> Check the console for errors.
[08:12:50] <ClassDude> Empty
[08:13:07] <BillCriswell> Are you adding the classes after you have the elements selected already?
[08:13:45] <ClassDude> The classes should be added first
[08:13:53] <ClassDude> But, yes they are added dynamicly
[08:14:06] <BillCriswell> Be sure they're added first then.
[08:14:31] <ClassDude> when do I assign the event handler then?
[08:14:47] <ClassDude> Because more elements with firstclass are added later on
[08:14:57] <BillCriswell> ClassDude: I'd use event delegation then.
[08:15:01] <ClassDude> (it's a chat)
[08:15:08] <ClassDude> Never heard of :o
[08:15:31] <BillCriswell> $('.holds-first-classes-but-not-dynamic').on('click', '.firstclasse', function () { });
[08:15:45] <BillCriswell> Then it wouldn't matter when or how you add them.
[08:15:47] <ClassDude> oh... on...
[08:15:53] <ClassDude> I'll give it a shot
[08:18:44] <BillCriswell> ClassDude: http://jsbin.com/gokunika/2/edit pretty basic demo of it here.
[08:19:21] <ClassDude> I don't think it's the event handler that won't work... It seems like I've sincerely fucked something up somewhere else
[08:19:48] <BillCriswell> ClassDude: Haha.
[08:23:49] <ClassDude> BillCriswell: It works when I assign the event handler on the parent, but not on the children... However it solves my problem so I'm happy but confused
[08:24:11] <BillCriswell> That's good I think.
[08:24:27] <BillCriswell> I'd definitely look a little closer so it doesn't bite you in the ass later.
[08:24:51] <ClassDude> Aight, thanks for you help anyhow :P
[08:32:22] <krambiorix> i know it's a css thingy but how can i set a border on a popover? I can't set it on .popover because the arrow is IN the popover div...
[08:34:33] <DansVC> Hi, I need help with my cache
[08:34:46] <krambiorix> sry, i found out myself popover-content...
[08:34:48] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:34:59] <DansVC> I think that it is breack my javascript website
[08:35:06] <DansVC> someone can help me?
[08:35:59] <DansVC> http://ray-dee-oh.com/ <- is supose that the page reload when finish to update the cache but it don't
[08:38:31] <DansVC> someone have some ideia how to fix it?
[08:56:53] <maxmoore14> anyone know how to work around this issue? https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/173
[08:57:53] <duch_kazatel> that's still kicking around?  weird.
[09:00:36] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: any idea how to use the alternate svg?
[09:02:39] <duch_kazatel> let me take a quick poke
[09:03:02] <maxmoore14> thx
[09:03:54] <harsk> hey all, i'm having an issue w/ my PHP here on line 40 and line 73. I'm not sure how I can iterate over the fields, could anyone recommend an alternative way in jQuery?
[09:03:56] <harsk> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/924e55227e039f92df5b
[09:05:35] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 what happens if you set the black icons and download anyway?
[09:05:40] <duch_kazatel> i know the preview doesn't change.
[09:05:55] <maxmoore14> still white
[09:07:59] <duch_kazatel> looking here: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/demos/widgets/icons/ under "Black vs. white icon sets", the only difference i'm seeing between the two is that the black icon has ui-icon-alt on the <a>
[09:08:03] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, nothing different.
[09:08:12] <duch_kazatel> not sure what all themeroller does, but that's all I can see.
[09:08:50] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: yeah, but that was 1.3
[09:08:50] <duch_kazatel> harsk i'm not familiar with PHP - you'd have to push that content out into your html for javascript to work with it.
[09:09:16] <maxmoore14> 1.4 changed to svg icons and is pretty different
[09:09:17] <harsk> duck_kazatel: okay

[09:10:04] <duch_kazatel> "Icons are white by default but you can switch to black icons by adding the ui-alt-icon class to the element or its container."
[09:11:43] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: cool, certainly looks like it works in the docs
[09:12:03] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 that's about all i can say tbh.  i don't know anything about themeroller.
[09:12:19] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: fair enough. Thanks for the help
[09:13:40] <Fishy> Why do some people rename jquery from jquery-(vesrion).js to just jquery.js
[09:14:14] <duch_kazatel> Fishy in cases like my company, it's easier to just have the file without needing to update references to the filena,me.
[09:14:15] <duch_kazatel> *filename
[09:16:06] <nhulea> yo what up
[09:16:20] <duch_kazatel> whuddup foolio
[09:16:25] <duch_kazatel> oh shit it's friday
[09:18:27] <agileadam> Anyone ever merged two select lists into one? I have two select lists that I want to “combine” (with a group for each)… I’m thinking I could hide the original two elements, generate a new one, and when the value of the new select list is altered it’d update the value of the hidden (display: none) fields accordingly. That should work, right?
[09:19:30] <duch_kazatel> agileadam why not make them look like that visually but not actually munge them together?
[09:21:44] <nhulea> pool party !
[09:21:57] <duch_kazatel> i'll probably swim again this weekend oddly enough.
[09:22:18] <nhulea> uh I meant at your house ?
[09:22:23] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:22:32] <nhulea> ha
[09:26:54] <agileadam> duch_kazatel: How could I do that? I’m not seeing it… but I might be thinking about it wrong.
[09:28:03] <duch_kazatel> agileadam mind fiddling up the two selects real quicK? want to make sure i understand waht you're trying to combine.
[09:31:41] <agileadam> Sure thing. standby.
[09:31:47] <duch_kazatel> anybody here have any experience actually using Reactive Programming in larger projects?
[09:32:57] <agileadam> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/9HzMa/
[09:33:03] <agileadam> Those are the two select lists...
[09:33:35] <duch_kazatel> ah, okay.  yeah spaced on my end there.
[09:33:44] <agileadam> I’d love to merge the two and just say “Ammenities” but have the values submit as if they were separate.
[09:34:41] <duch_kazatel> you can do that on the frotnend, but that's a little hacky.,  any reason you can't combine in the backend?
[09:34:58] <agileadam> Well, yeah, it’s a Drupal site and I cannot really make changes to the existing structure.
[09:35:11] <agileadam> Two taxonomies, two fields, two filters… separate everywhere.
[09:35:11] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[09:35:12] <duch_kazatel> okay
[09:36:33] <agileadam> Yeah. :(
[09:36:59] <agileadam> I don’t mind it being hacky frontend-only… it’s a low-traffic website without any sensitive information or anything.
[09:37:05] <agileadam> just need to clean up this form a bit.
[09:38:13] <duch_kazatel> so there are a few approaches you could take.
[09:38:58] <duch_kazatel> one idea is to create a third select, hit up your first amenities dropdown and great the optgroup and then append options one at a time to that group, then rinse and repeat for the other group.
[09:39:35] <agileadam> alright, i’m hearing ya
[09:39:40] <duch_kazatel> in that process, add a data attribute for each option that ties that back to the original dropdown.
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> then build a handler on change that checks the data attribute and handles from there.
[09:42:33] <agileadam> I like it.
[09:42:45] <agileadam> Kinda what I was thinking. The confirmation is good.
[09:43:24] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those cases where there are a few ways to approach the problem - it's all about what approach you choose.
[09:43:39] <duch_kazatel> but make sure you do your heavy lifting in the fragment before appending to the document.
[09:47:17] <agileadam> Oh! I was heading in the wrong direction there. Thanks.
[09:47:31] <duch_kazatel> :) that'll make things a little better.
[09:50:29] <agileadam> :D
[10:01:23] <hesco> is there a method which will reset a radio button?
[10:01:39] <duch_kazatel> define "reset"
[10:01:55] <hesco> not to the other option but to no option chosen, kind of reset
[10:02:20] <duch_kazatel> not without setting prop('checked', false) on them probablyu.
[10:02:22] <hesco> it defaults to null, I guess, not sure.
[10:02:22] <duch_kazatel> *probably
[10:02:42] <hesco> thanks, will look at that.
[10:18:32] <Smashcat> Hi, is there an easy way to screate private variables when initialising an event handler in jquery. Non-working example here: http://pastebin.com/CcQy93zp I need 1 handler linked to 2 elements, but "myN" should be 0 for the first element, and 1 for the second.
[10:18:46] <duch_kazatel> javascript does not have private variables.
[10:18:58] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to create two separate objects.
[10:18:58] <Smashcat> You can emulate it via encapsulation
[10:19:19] <Smashcat> I'm just not getting the syntax right in this initialisation
[10:19:28] <duch_kazatel> err, kind of.  you either need to bind a separate function, or use a constructor.
[10:19:54] <Smashcat> Yeah, I've done it before, but haven't used JS in a while
[10:20:26] <Smashcat> Just need someone to see where I've messed up there
[10:20:57] <duch_kazatel> that's a really strange way to bind event handlers btw.
[10:25:06] <TheEternalAbyss> question: ie8 is giving me an issue with jquery. it's saying an argument is undefined, so I'm assuming it's somehow fallen into a racing condition
[10:25:30] <TheEternalAbyss> though I'm not exactly sure how since it's just as the page loads and i'm not doing anything until the dom is ready
[10:25:39] <TheEternalAbyss> so the question..
[10:25:52] <TheEternalAbyss> are there known issues with ie8 doing this?
[10:26:03] <TheEternalAbyss> cause I am not running into this problem with other browsers
[10:26:03] <duch_kazatel> Smashcat you could do something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/MdC9a/2/ though not terribly elegant.
[10:26:11] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss what is the actual area.
[10:26:13] <duch_kazatel> *error
[10:26:47] <TheEternalAbyss> invalid argument
[10:27:02] <TheEternalAbyss> for some variable h
[10:27:11] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing the code in a fiddle?
[10:27:43] <TheEternalAbyss> i can try.... it's an internal page so... you'd be getting barely a peek at what is really going on.. one moment
[10:27:48] <Smashcat> duch_kazatel: Heh yeah, I was thinking of something like that, but the array of elements will be supplied by PHP, so I need to be able to store a unique value for each event handler. I could just use a global hash and reference that by a key based on the element id but it's so ugly
[10:32:36] <Smashcat> Ah, got it. Adding another attribute to the element linked to the handler, so the handler can read that works. Sucks that I can't use encapsulation though - I'm sure I've done it before with handlers... oh well
[10:35:10] <duch_kazatel> you could do it that way.  it all depends on scope and whatnot.
[10:36:28] <Smashcat> duch_kazatel: It always works, as the object with the handler has the data, so it's picking it up fine. Going to have to post a StackExchange question about creating private vars in event handlers though, as there didn't seem to be any about it.
[10:36:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah in that case you'd have to use constructors iirc.
[10:37:36] <Zeiler> Hello fellow jQuery developers! I'm developing a custom-tailored jQuery gallery as a way to help me understand animations, and jQuery in general, better. However I've run into a problem - sequential functions. It seems that all my different animations (fadeOut, fadeIn, Remove, etc.) happen at the same time rather than after each other.
[10:38:04] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler yep.  they're are asyncronous.
[10:38:05] <Zeiler> I've tried using .queue(), but that seems to only work when it's 1 element that has to do all these things. I am fading out different elements in order and then removing some etc.
[10:38:06] <Smashcat> duch_kazatel: Yep, somehow. Tried a few ways - might be something that jQuery is doing. but even encapsulated values all end up the same - as though "n" in my example is becoming a global.
[10:38:29] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler you need to use callbacks :)
[10:38:48] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: I've used callbacks as well, but it just got so... so... HAIRY after a while.
[10:39:19] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler if you want one thing to wait until after another completes in this case, that's basically your only option afaik.
[10:40:12] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: I see. I'll have to try and make it work. I guess I just need to man up! (:
[10:40:47] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the fast response!
[10:40:59] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler of course :)
[10:44:33] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: Ah yes! Now that I am restructuring it, I remember my problem with callbacks. I currently want to fade out ever element with the class ".album". So I run this: "$('.album').each(function () {" and then fadeout(250). Then when the fadeout finishes, I want it to callback a new function. This is all fine and dandy, but the issue is that then the callback is called for EACH .album element.
[10:44:48] <Zeiler> What if I want a function to only be called once inside a callback inside an .each() function?
[10:45:22] <TheEternalAbyss> remember kids... you're only one missing curly bracket from pulling out all your hair
[10:45:42] <TheEternalAbyss> if I smoked, now would be a time for me to take a smoke break lol
[10:45:42] <duch_kazatel> do you need to run an each in that case, zeiler?
[10:45:56] <Zeiler> Well, how else would I fadeout all the .album elements? :c
[10:46:10] <duch_kazatel> i'm pretty sure the .each() is implied.
[10:46:22] <duch_kazatel> i could be wrong though,'
[10:47:35] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/xgWhEQkE
[10:47:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/pRqTt/1/
[10:47:54] <duch_kazatel> see my fiddle.
[10:48:10] <Zeiler> Hmm...
[10:48:32] <Zeiler> That would make the callback be a onetime thing..
[10:48:39] <Zeiler> I think.
[10:48:45] <duch_kazatel> interesting,  it doesn't.
[10:48:51] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/pRqTt/2/
[10:49:08] <TheEternalAbyss> am I doing this wrong? is this a way to add a cookie? and load the correct stylesheet onload of the page? http://jsfiddle.net/5pTWz/

[10:49:54] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[10:50:01] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: You just want certain stylesheets for ie?
[10:50:47] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: oh that seems clever! But it also seems like a hack for something that should be pretty straight forward. Are callbacks really this seldom used?
[10:51:06] <TheEternalAbyss> yes and no
[10:51:13] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Ok.
[10:51:25] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: i just want it to switch properly since i can't use html5 localstorage on ie8
[10:51:44] <TheEternalAbyss> and currently it's not loading the stylesheet on page load
[10:52:14] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: It looks like ie8 supports local storage.
[10:52:29] <TheEternalAbyss> really? then I'm very confused
[10:52:45] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm
[10:55:01] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: How are you accessing the localStorage variables? I believe old IE has an issue with localStorage.foo, but localStorage.getItem('foo') would be cool.
[10:55:23] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm using getItem
[10:57:04] <TheEternalAbyss> it's not pulling the stylesheet though it seems
[10:57:13] <TheEternalAbyss> let me post my code
[10:57:54] <TheEternalAbyss> http://jsfiddle.net/5pTWz/1
[10:58:39] <TheEternalAbyss> oops didn't paste a }
[10:58:53] <TheEternalAbyss> it's correct in my code tho
[11:00:18] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler you have to use callbacks in this case.
[11:00:27] <duch_kazatel> but abstract using functions so you don't wind up in callback hell.
[11:00:43] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Do you have rel="stylesheet" on the link tag?
[11:01:01] <TheEternalAbyss> yes i do
[11:01:18] <TheEternalAbyss> now that I am looking at this I think I screwed up my syntax...
[11:01:21] <TheEternalAbyss> one moment
[11:01:30] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: roger that
[11:02:23] <TheEternalAbyss> http://jsfiddle.net/5pTWz/5
[11:02:34] <TheEternalAbyss> ok that has the correct code
[11:03:26] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: http://jsbin.com/qiciqafe/1/edit?js,output You're not doing anything more than this. Does this work in IE8 for you?
[11:04:11] <TheEternalAbyss> I can try that. why the timeout tho?
[11:04:27] <BillCriswell> Just to show you the other stylesheet is loaded first.
[11:04:45] <TheEternalAbyss> ah ok. let me give it a try. give me a min :)
[11:06:30] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: is it bad practice to throw around callbacks in custom functions as function parameters?
[11:06:58] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: Like, I have my custom function: function resize_background(stateclass, callback) and then it calls whatever function I throw as the callback parameter after it's aminamtion
[11:07:59] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: seems like it is not
[11:09:34] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Switch it to jQuery 1.9
[11:09:37] <BillCriswell> it works with that.
[11:09:48] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qiciqafe/2/edit?js,output
[11:09:53] <TheEternalAbyss> that....may not be super feasible
[11:09:56] <imjakechapman> Can anyone tell me why I'm getting undefined function error with this code? http://laravel.io/bin/K4xX
[11:10:20] <TheEternalAbyss> i need to talk to my team to see if we can switch without killing anything
[11:10:29] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: What version are you using?
[11:10:32] <TheEternalAbyss> 1.5
[11:10:37] <BillCriswell> That might still be ok.
[11:10:44] <BillCriswell> IT's the 2 that's killing old IE support.
[11:10:56] <TheEternalAbyss> oh?
[11:10:58] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler not sure what you mean.
[11:10:59] <TheEternalAbyss> i wasn't aware
[11:11:11] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: aight nevermind. If it works, it works ^^
[11:11:22] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:11:56] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Try switching it to your jQuery version as see if it works.
[11:12:19] <TheEternalAbyss> ok
[11:13:48] <TheEternalAbyss> looks like it does run with 1.5  in jsbin
[11:13:57] <BillCriswell> Recruiter calls at work are the worth.
[11:14:04] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[11:14:24] <BillCriswell> I wish I was capable of being rude to someone.
[11:14:24] <imjakechapman> nvm, got it! :D
[11:14:33] <imjakechapman> wasn't wrapped with jQuery.
[11:14:55] <imjakechapman> you'd think the $.each would inject a jquery wrapped object to the callback function. :)
[11:15:28] <duch_kazatel> imjakechapman you can also trop the elm and id and just reference $(this) instead.
[11:15:50] <imjakechapman> duch_kazatel, basically what I ended up with :)
[11:15:51] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: It would be doing more work than it needs to though.
[11:16:08] <imjakechapman> BillCriswell, yea makes sense now
[11:16:19] <imjakechapman> If I want a jQuery wrapped object I can do it myself lol
[11:24:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Any CMS you use in particular/
[11:25:11] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: thank you so much for your help! It works perfectly! There is a lot of repeated code, but it is very easy to read and understand and theres no lag/jittering to be seen! :D
[11:25:39] <duch_kazatel> Zeelot i'd abstract that out more then, but good.
[11:25:48] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell nope.  all my current stuff is hand rolled
[11:26:02] <TheEternalAbyss> wait......
[11:26:12] <TheEternalAbyss> gawd.....i realized what I was doing...
[11:26:35] <TheEternalAbyss> I'm appending -msie.css to the wrong stylesheet
[11:26:39] * TheEternalAbyss facepalms
[11:26:41] <duch_kazatel> err, Zeiler
[11:26:51] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: haha don't worry - I caught that
[11:28:05] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: See, I like that because I know exactly what's going on all the time.
[11:30:21] <Mindstorm8191> oh cool, there _is_ a jquery channel. Hi everyone :)
[11:30:51] <TheEternalAbyss> there a way to force ie8 to render in standard document mode and not derp/quirks mode?
[11:30:57] <TheEternalAbyss> hi Mindstorm8191
[11:31:25] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it really depends on what i'm doing, but 9/10 i find that if I pick a CMS, I'll end up hacking it apart anyway.  so if I have time, why not just roll my own?
[11:31:30] <duch_kazatel> totally depends on the case though.
[11:32:00] <duch_kazatel> also: code reviewing for non developers is painful.
[11:32:22] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: html5 doctype
[11:32:39] <Mindstorm8191> TheEternalAbyss: hi. I'm kinda trying to work out putting multiple clock timers on my page... not sure how yet
[11:32:43] <BillCriswell> Or a strict html4, or whatever.
[11:32:52] <BillCriswell> Think most will... Google would be way more helpful.
[11:35:29] <duch_kazatel> a valid doctype period.
[11:36:56] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't loose still give you quirks mode?
[11:37:01] <BillCriswell> I feel like an old man talking about this shit.
[11:37:18] <BillCriswell> Just use the HTML5 doctype whippersnappers.
[11:37:18] <TheEternalAbyss> still in quirks mode...
[11:37:55] <TheEternalAbyss> why the flying hell does it do that
[11:37:57] <BillCriswell> Did you click that dumbass button in ie8 for compatability.
[11:37:59] <duch_kazatel> do you have anything before the doctype?
[11:38:14] <duch_kazatel> even invisible chars can be a problem.
[11:38:20] <TheEternalAbyss> nothing duch_kazatel
[11:38:30] <TheEternalAbyss> i'll double check in case there's a space or something
[11:38:45] <duch_kazatel> also BOMs, etc.
[11:38:47] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: where is that button in the settings or tha one in the address bar?
[11:39:44] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> ?
[11:40:07] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: thanks I was considering that too
[11:40:18] <TheEternalAbyss> would that mess with ff and chrome?
[11:40:19] <duch_kazatel> also check to see if you have a BOM in there somewhere.
[11:40:23] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: It's next to the address bar right by the refresh button so it's easy to mess things up.
[11:40:25] <BillCriswell> I think.
[11:40:38] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: excuse my ignorance..what's a BOM?
[11:40:44] <duch_kazatel> Byte Order Mark.
[11:40:53] <duch_kazatel> !g byte order mark remove
[11:40:59] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: How do I remove the BOM character from my xml file - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/295472/how-do-i-remove-the-bom-character-from-my-xml-file
[11:42:04] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: oh...wow.. ok good to know
[11:42:04] <Mindstorm8191> well, while I'm here I might as well ask the important questions: are there any ad services that will allow me to update the ad while viewing the same page?
[11:42:30] <TheEternalAbyss> sorry got disconnected...so that meta tage shouldn't screw with firefox and chrom would it?
[11:42:37] <TheEternalAbyss> tag*
[11:42:58] <TheEternalAbyss> looks like the doctype kicked in. must have been the cache or soemthing
[11:44:25] <duch_kazatel> Mindstorm8191 huh?
[11:44:32] <duch_kazatel> Mindstorm8191 that sounds a little... out there.
[11:45:03] <TheEternalAbyss> .. you mean load a different ad via ajax call?
[11:45:21] <TheEternalAbyss> cause that's probably the way to do it i would imagine
[11:45:32] <duch_kazatel> they won't like that.
[11:45:43] <TheEternalAbyss> who are 'they'?
[11:45:49] <duch_kazatel> the ad network.
[11:46:00] <duch_kazatel> they don't like it when you mess with the ad.  at all.
[11:46:05] <Mindstorm8191> TheEternalAbyss: yeah something like that.  I've been working on a website game (or two) and I could utilize things like JQuery and AJAX a lot more if I could make reasonable updates to the on-screen ads
[11:46:17] <Mindstorm8191> maybe change it once every 1-5 minutes.  something fair
[11:46:29] <duch_kazatel> Mindstorm8191 you'd need to see if that's kosher via the TOS for the ad network.
[11:46:34] <duch_kazatel> and see how they want that done.
[11:46:35] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: oh....welll...i don't care for ads so I'd mess with them >:)
[11:46:48] <TheEternalAbyss> but yea better follow TOS Mindstorm8191
[11:46:59] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss i think he's serving them up to make money with them, so he needs to play by their rules.
[11:46:59] <Guest2441> I have a question
[11:47:08] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: agreed
[11:47:10] <duch_kazatel> i have water!
[11:47:31] <Mindstorm8191> duch_kazatel: so far I've been using Google Adsense.  As of a fewyears ago, they strictly blocked any chance to update the ads
[11:47:38] <TheEternalAbyss> wait.. Mindstorm8191 ...ifi t's a game, why would you care the rate at which ads switch??
[11:48:13] <Mindstorm8191> TheEternalAbyss: well I want to be fair to the ads
[11:48:35] <TheEternalAbyss> what unfairness is there? I don't follow
[11:49:15] <Mindstorm8191> I'd rather update every minute or more, than say every 5 seconds, where nobody really looks at the ads anyway
[11:49:27] <Mindstorm8191> where nobody can* look at the ads
[11:49:32] <duch_kazatel> that's going to inflate your impression.
[11:49:36] <duch_kazatel> *impressions.
[11:49:39] <duch_kazatel> that's against their TOS
[11:50:07] <TheEternalAbyss> wouldn't that depend on how you are displaying the ads in the firstplace?
[11:50:17] <Mindstorm8191> duch_kazatel: well the average page gets changed out much more often than once every 5 minutes
[11:50:34] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter - that's going to look way suspicious.
[11:50:34] <TheEternalAbyss> like for instance words with friends on iPad, basically throws the ad at you between moves
[11:50:59] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: you still here m8?
[11:51:14] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:51:26] <Mindstorm8191> TheEternalAbyss: yahoo mail's ad changes every time you make any action with mail.  it never really updates the whole page
[11:51:27] <TheEternalAbyss> as opposed to talkatone that has ad on there all the time
[11:51:31] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: if($(".album-thumb:animated").length === 0) doesn't seem to wor
[11:51:39] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: it still calls it once per element
[11:52:03] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler i'd need to see your code.
[11:52:04] <TheEternalAbyss> I dunno... would seem to me that if you allow them to put ads, it's their call how to show them, and timing for switching out
[11:52:18] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/GZzihLb9
[11:52:19] <TheEternalAbyss> I personally would just not use ads and put up a donation link
[11:52:30] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: it's running the ajax call once per element and also the resize_background function once per element
[11:52:31] <TheEternalAbyss> that's my personal preference
[11:53:06] <CrowX-> when I set an element's css attribute, that happens synchronously, right?
[11:53:11] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler i'd have to see it in action.
[11:53:12] <CrowX-> asynchroniously*
[11:53:17] <shekarsiri> Hi, can anyone please help me with tinymce, I am using ajax calls, so tinymce loading only once. I have tried with "tinymce.execCommand('mceAddEditor', true, '#teditor');"
[11:53:31] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: erhm. Aight hold on, let me try to upload it
[11:53:40] <Mindstorm8191> TheEternalAbyss: understood.  Someday I would like to include paid-for in-game bonuses, but a) I would have to complete the game first, and b) I wouldn't want to have that until I know that system is secure
[11:54:05] <Mindstorm8191> oh well, maybe discuss it later.  Time to get ready for work
[11:54:05] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler why not move that .remove() call until after your other logic?  i wonder if that's part of the problem.
[11:54:08] <Mindstorm8191> later everyone :)
[11:54:09] <TheEternalAbyss> it's as secure as it's going to get as long as you do your part
[11:54:17] <TheEternalAbyss> later Mindstorm8191. good luck
[11:54:25] <Mindstorm8191> thanks
[11:54:28] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: mm, I could do that I guess... But why would that stop the functions from calling multiple times?
[11:55:50] <Zeiler> duch_kazatel: that sort of fixed it. I guess the problem was that it's hard to call :animated on an element that has just been removed
[11:56:59] <duch_kazatel> Zeiler :)
[11:57:07] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[11:58:22] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure .remove() makes it not match :animated anymore
[12:00:19] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[12:00:53] <Zeiler> exactly gnarf
[12:00:55] <Zeiler> that was the issue
[12:00:59] <Zeiler> fixed that shit right up
[12:01:11] <gnarf> yeah, verified, .remove() stops animations
[12:01:19] <gnarf> when it purges the data
[12:01:32] <Zeiler> This shit is running so smoothly. I fucking love jQuery :3
[12:01:46] <kwizz> I'm using jqueryui to menu out some lists. How would I set each menu button to scroll to a specific portion of the page?
[12:03:03] <gnarf> though interestingly, it doesn't actually stop the animation, it just removes the data that tells jQuery it's animated :)
[12:04:03] <Zeiler> Quick question: If I want to remove say.. all <br> tags inside #awesomediv, how would I go about doing that?
[12:04:19] <Zeiler> something something .children?
[12:04:45] <gnarf> $("#awesomediv br").remove()
[12:05:00] <Zeiler> ah, fantastic
[12:05:01] <Zeiler> thanks
[12:05:04] <duch_kazatel> or $('br', '#awesomediv').remove();
[12:05:13] <Zeiler> I see!
[12:05:16] <duch_kazatel> or $('#awesomediv').find('br').remove()
[12:05:18] <gnarf> or if you already had $("#awesomediv") -- awesomeDiv.find("br") or awesomeDiv.children("br")
[12:05:18] <duch_kazatel> or or or :)
[12:05:19] <Zeiler> Haha :D
[12:05:27] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of choices.
[12:05:31] <Zeiler> So it seems
[12:05:36] <gnarf> children is only direct children, find finds grandchildren
[12:05:44] <gnarf> and $(a, b) === $(b).find(a)
[12:05:51] <Zeiler> I like $("#awesomediv br").remove() because its very like CSS
[12:06:13] <gnarf> if you already have a reference to the outer div though, use find, probably better in the long run
[12:06:25] <duch_kazatel> and faster usually.
[12:07:07] <Zeiler> wait what? If I have $("#awesomediv") somewhere in my code, I can access it later by simply putting awesomediv?
[12:07:19] <Zeiler> does it create objects dynamically?
[12:07:26] <gnarf> var awesomeDiv = $("#awesomediv");
[12:07:33] <Zeiler> Ah, okay
[12:07:37] <gnarf> "cache" the selection, avoid having to look up the same element again
[12:07:43] <Zeiler> That... That is smart..
[12:07:53] <duch_kazatel> yep :)
[12:08:04] <gnarf> jQuery pro-tip #1 - don't search when you already know the answer ;)
[12:08:06] <Zeiler> I look for $( '#gallery-container' ) 10-14 times in my code currently
[12:08:45] <gnarf> Zeiler: if the #gallery-container can change (which since it's an ID, i assume it doesn't) then search for it again (i.e. because you used ajax and replaced that element)
[12:09:13] <gnarf> otherwise, scope a var that saves a reference to the DOM query rather than ask the DOM to query every time you want to use it
[12:09:13] <Zeiler> gnarf: it never changes. Only the content of it changes. I populate and remove elements inside of it with ajax
[12:10:18] <gnarf> everytime you call $( selector ) - you are asking the DOM to query something, and working with the dom probably one of the "slowest" things you can do (other than editing a bunch of html/attributes/creating a bunch of elements, etc)
[12:10:32] <gnarf> basically, do any work in the DOM - its slow
[12:10:48] <gnarf> searching by ID is usually super fast, but still, avoiding having to look again is EVEN FASTER :)
[12:11:24] <Zeiler> I see. I'll remember that for future work ^^ Currently my gallery is pretty simple (just a bunch of fades, animations and ajax calls), but I guess it's always good practice to make it faster :D
[12:11:38] <duch_kazatel> you can also avoid the extra work that the jquery constructor runs, too.
[12:18:04] <hesco> There can be multiple classes assigned by providing a space delimited list, as in:  <div class="error has_error">; right?
[12:18:36] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:19:07] <kwizz> (kwizz) I'm using jqueryui to menu out some lists. How would I set each menu button to scroll to a specific portion of the page?
[12:19:33] <hesco> and if that class exists, it should trigger this rule, right?  $('.has_error').on('load', function() { $('#list_options :radio').prop('checked', false);  });
[12:19:57] <TheEternalAbyss> by the way, thank you very much BillCriswell  and duch_kazatel
[12:20:03] <hesco> kwizz: you want to add internal anchors to your page and link to the anchors
[12:20:03] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss of course :)
[12:20:09] <TheEternalAbyss> things are pretty smooth now :)
[12:20:33] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: No problem.
[12:22:24] <duch_kazatel> today is a newb help day for me.
[12:23:20] <TheEternalAbyss> lol I was going to say "hey...i'm not a noob" but then again I'm far from being an expert of this stuff.. so....yea lol
[12:23:34] <duch_kazatel> oh, no, didn't mean you.
[12:23:43] <duch_kazatel> i meant the CR i was running for a coworker
[12:23:49] <BillCriswell> We're all noobs.
[12:23:54] <duch_kazatel> truth
[12:23:58] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[12:24:00] <TheEternalAbyss> aye
[12:24:06] <BillCriswell> If you think you aren't, you're a serious fucking noob.
[12:24:13] <TheEternalAbyss> lmao ^^
[12:24:22] <TheEternalAbyss> I'm goign to steal that BillCriswell
[12:24:24] <TheEternalAbyss> going*
[12:24:28] <duch_kazatel> dunning-kruger effect.
[12:24:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Absolutely.
[12:27:00] <kwizz> hesco: thanks. That was probably not a jquery question and more of a home, but hey. For the record. I'm a total noob.
[12:27:05] <hesco> as one noob to several others:  why my event at line 36 is not doing what I hope:  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=AoSnccDlBm  ???
[12:27:16] <kwizz> *html
[12:28:33] <hesco> kwizz:  after suggesting the html way, I wondered if in fact you wanted to effect a SCROLL to that anchor with jquery; and for that you'd have to ask others far less or at least some less nooby-ish than I
[12:29:14] <duch_kazatel> hesco i don't think the load event fires on a normal div like that but i could be wrong.
[12:29:24] <duch_kazatel> aaaand lunchtime.
[12:29:25] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:29:41] <hesco> and duch_kazatel:  further on your question from yesterday, today I used the collaboration tool rather than the share tool, because the share tool does not seem to be available to me today.
[12:30:11] <hesco> thanks duch_kazatel: will consult the docs on that question
[12:32:01] <Zeiler> Does anyone know why $( '#image' ).height() is giving me a type error?
[12:32:20] <Zeiler> when I run it in the chrome console it works fine, but when I execute it from my source it gives me: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[12:32:34] <Zeiler> $( '.image-construct img' ).height() + 31331
[12:32:36] <Zeiler> woops
[12:34:51] <BillCriswell> Zeiler: That shouldn't give you a type error. You would need to show your code.
[12:35:18] <CrowX-> why does this line gives me error in firefox, but works well in chrome?
[12:35:20] <CrowX-> $(element).css({width: ($(element).attr('data-multiplySize') * ($("#content").width() - $('.presspage').width() - parseInt($('.presspage').css('margin-left'), 10) - parseInt($('.presspage').css('margin-right'), 10) - parseInt($('.presspage').css('margin'), 10) - 5) + 'px'), height: 'auto'});
[12:35:25] <Zeiler> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/e7Wr3WXT
[12:35:34] <CrowX-> the error in ff is "declaration dropped"
[12:35:42] <Zeiler> BillCriswell: Is it because my DOM hasn't been populated with the .append() yet, before I call the .height() ?
[12:37:07] <BillCriswell>  Zeiler: The last argument of animate needs to be a reference ot a function.
[12:37:30] <Zeiler> BillCriswell: that part of the deal is working just fine though.
[12:38:05] <BillCriswell> It's not waiting for the animation to finish.
[12:39:19] <Zeiler> BillCriswell: ah, you're right. It is working now - however the newHeight() is 31..
[12:40:10] <BillCriswell> Zeiler: That just means the image isn't loaded yet.
[12:40:26] <BillCriswell> You'd have to wait till the images are loaded before trying to get their height.
[12:40:39] <Zeiler> BillCriswell: indeed. Do you know how I can search in the result of my Ajax call? I suppose theres a fairly easy way to search the imageData variable I get back from my ajax call
[12:40:56] <BillCriswell> imjakechapman: What type of data is it?
[12:41:05] <BillCriswell> What are you searching for?
[12:41:11] <imjakechapman> I figured it out
[12:41:18] <Zeiler> The height of the image (:
[12:41:21] <imjakechapman> it was .data('module')
[12:41:53] <BillCriswell> Zeiler: So it's just a number?
[12:42:45] <Zeiler> Hmm
[12:46:27] <Zeiler> How is this not working o.O
[12:46:29] <Zeiler> http://pastebin.com/Q4tdKfS5
[12:46:37] <Zeiler> newHeight is simply 31
[12:48:15] <jphase> Zeiler: use $(this).height() instead
[12:48:28] * jphase is assuming
[12:49:26] <Zeiler> jphase: still doesn't work :/
[12:49:31] <jphase> doh!
[12:50:50] <imjakechapman> anyone know how to trigger masonry using vanilla js? I'm using it with Require.js and not using Bridget to use Masonry as a jquery plugin. Code -> http://laravel.io/bin/PzQ1#7
[12:51:21] <jphase> Zeiler: try binding your load event to the container after you append... $('#gallery-container').append(imageData).load(function(){
[12:51:33] <Zeiler> aight, hold on jphase
[12:51:51] <imjakechapman> When I do the inifiniteScroll gets new items I'm triggering an event on the window. But using .masonry doesn't work because I'm not using the jQuery version
[12:52:36] <Zeiler> jphase: height() is still returning 0
[12:53:02] <Zeiler> $( '#gallery-container' ).append( imageData ).load(console.log($( '.image-construct img' ).height()));
[12:53:10] <Zeiler> returns 0
[12:55:02] <Zeiler> jphase: AHAA!
[12:55:09] <Zeiler> jphase: an image has no height when it is display:none;
[12:55:11] <Zeiler> obviously
[12:56:21] <jphase> oh there ya go
[12:56:22] <jphase> hehe
[13:05:30] <TheWhisper> anyone know how I can replace multiple things from a string?
[13:05:49] <TheWhisper> I want to do something like: $(this).replace('.html', '').replace('./pieces/', '');
[13:05:59] <TheWhisper> but obviously two replaces like that doesn't work
[13:06:30] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Yes they do.
[13:06:37] <TheWhisper> really?
[13:06:39] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:06:40] <TheWhisper> hm, wasn't working for me
[13:06:41] <TheWhisper> lemme try again
[13:06:47] <BillCriswell> Are you really trying on $(this) though?
[13:07:05] <TheWhisper> $(this).attr('href').replace('.html', '').replace('./pieces/', '');
[13:07:10] <TheWhisper> is the full string
[13:07:24] <TheWhisper> Oh, I think I'm replacing the path too early
[13:07:32] <TheWhisper> so it's not requesting the right place
[13:08:30] <TheWhisper> basically, BillCriswell, without the second .replace(), my URL looks like: site.com/index_wip.html#./pieces/piece1
[13:08:37] <TheWhisper> I want it to just be #piece1
[13:09:27] <TheWhisper> Ah, figured it out
[13:09:38] <TheWhisper> window.location.hash = toLoad.replace('./pieces/', '');
[13:09:46] <TheWhisper> (the string I posted earlier was called toLoad)
[13:09:51] <TheWhisper> thanks
[13:09:57] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[13:10:10] <TheWhisper> bleh
[13:10:23] <TheWhisper> oh, nvm
[13:10:27] <TheWhisper> not bleh :P
[13:10:53] <Zeiler> So... I am experiencing a pretty weird issue. I have an attribute "data-albumid" which returns 2 no matter what I do to it.
[13:11:29] <GoSox> Hi. I just want to verify that things work the way I think they do. If I make a .ajax() call with a short timeout, say 1 second. And that timeout is reached, that triggers the .fail() function right?
[13:11:48] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, I'm using https://github.com/f0r4y312/jquery-stylesheet right now, but it's working strangely in Chrome. I'm wondering if the fact that it hasn't been updated recently could be the reason. Do you know of any similar plugins that are up-to-date?
[13:11:49] <alaing> Zeiler: do you have a demo? coudl you put up one on jsfiddle.net
[13:12:27] <Zeiler> alaing: http://pastebin.com/SVRR68D6 this is the output of the chrome console
[13:13:21] <Zeiler> What the flying f*** is going on here? http://pastebin.com/SVRR68D6 lol
[13:13:29] <Zeiler> how is it still outputting 2?
[13:14:12] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: I can't think of a time where I'd need to modify stylesheets through javascript.
[13:14:30] <TheWhisper> I'm modifying classes and then adding them to elements
[13:16:03] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: That seems like a really weird thing to do.
[13:16:15] <alaing> Zeiler: http://jsfiddle.net/5vLhn/ working for me
[13:16:17] <TheWhisper> I dunno, seemed the most logical to me
[13:16:53] <Zeiler> alaing: well, it's obviously not working for me :|
[13:17:27] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: Different strokes for different folks I guess.
[13:17:28] <alaing> Zeiler: can you try that example in your browser?
[13:17:40] <Zeiler> alaing: just did, your example works fine
[13:17:42] <alaing> Zeiler: pastebin doesn't help
[13:18:49] <Zeiler> alaing: this is weird as fuck...
[13:19:03] <alaing> Zeiler: you not setting the data attribute with .attr look at this update http://jsfiddle.net/5vLhn/1/
[13:19:19] <alaing> Zeiler: maybe you got code some where else that sets it?
[13:21:00] <shoky> Zeiler: only .attr("data-albumid", ...)  would actually change the attribute
[13:21:16] <Zeiler> shoky: yes, and that is what I am using atm
[13:21:25] <Zeiler>   $( '#back-button' ).attr("data-albumid", a_id);
[13:21:26] <shoky> best to stick to .data("albumid" though  cause usually there's no need to actually change the attribute
[13:21:52] <Zeiler> I change the attribute on the fly
[13:24:57] <alaing> Zeiler: shoky is just saying to use  $( '#back-button' ).data("albumid", a_id);
[13:25:07] <alaing> instead of .attr
[13:25:20] <Zeiler> alaing: doing that doesn't change the data attribute for me
[13:25:32] <alaing> see my last example
[13:25:32] <shoky> Zeiler: you probably don't need to change the attribute
[13:25:45] <shoky> just jquery's data
[13:25:49] <shoky> more efficient
[13:26:04] <alaing> +1 with shoky
[13:26:34] <Zeiler> and I would do that how? I'm using the data attribute to remember what album I am coming from so when I press back it will load the previous gallery via ajax.
[13:26:46] <shoky> using .data() only
[13:26:51] <shoky> to write and to read
[13:26:51] <alaing> using .data('albumid')
[13:27:10] <alaing>  $( '#back-button' ).data("albumid")
[13:27:35] <alaing> Zeiler: read the api http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:27:36] <shoky> the first time you call .data('albumid')   it reads from the data-albumid for you. but only the first time, and it never writes out back to the attribute (because that would be wasteful in most cases)
[13:28:34] <Zeiler> I see
[13:29:07] <Zeiler> I might be retarded, but you guys are being awfully cryptic about reading and writing to the data attribute :s
[13:29:10] <Zeiler> Not sure if I understand
[13:29:26] <Zeiler> $( '#back-button' ).data("albumid") is a read only thing
[13:29:38] <shoky> .data('albumid', something)  doesn't write to the attribute
[13:29:48] <shoky> it writes to internal jquery data that is associated with the element
[13:29:49] <Zeiler> but it changes the internal data?
[13:29:51] <shoky> yes
[13:29:52] <Zeiler> I see
[13:29:56] <Zeiler> so it's like a global var
[13:30:11] <Zeiler> which I only get once and then manipulate in my code..
[13:30:14] <Zeiler> I guess?
[13:30:14] <shoky> not really but i get what you mean, yes
[13:30:18] <Zeiler> I see
[13:30:26] <Zeiler> thanks m8, I'll try to work with that. brb ^^
[13:34:47] <Zeiler> shoky: okay so it works now..
[13:35:02] <Zeiler> shoky: but it doesn't appear anywhere in my markup. It's like jquery deletes it from the DOM when I read it with .data();
[13:35:10] <Zeiler> shoky: jQuery sure works in mysterious ways <.<
[13:37:21] <shoky> Zeiler: it's more expensive to actually write to an attribute of a DOM element
[13:38:27] <shoky> Zeiler: and like we've said, there is no need to, in most cases
[13:39:41] <shoky> Zeiler: it's just like when you put data in some var , that doesn't show up in the DOM inspector either
[13:40:05] <Zeiler> shoky: yeah, but I don't write vars in html code! :p
[13:40:20] <TheWhisper> okay, I'm having some trouble
[13:40:26] <TheWhisper> if you go to http://discoverdan.com/index_wip#work
[13:40:47] <TheWhisper> and click on like the second image
[13:40:50] <TheWhisper> then scroll down a bit
[13:40:54] <TheWhisper> and without scrolling up
[13:40:58] <TheWhisper> click on one of the left nav links
[13:41:01] <shoky> Zeiler: anytime you do  var x = $('#myelement').text()  or something  you're reading data from the "html code" into a var :P
[13:41:10] <TheWhisper> you get this: http://i.imgur.com/vIGtcS2.png
[13:41:13] <TheWhisper> anyone know how to fix that?
[13:41:29] <Synthead> is it possible to create elements like GTK's Frame widget in jQuery UI?  http://zetcode.com/img/gui/cgtk/frames.png
[13:41:38] <shoky> Zeiler: .data() is for the internal data stuff, but it also has that extra feature that the first time you call it on an element, it reads the data-xxx attributes for you into memory
[13:41:53] <shoky> nothing too mysterious
[13:52:55] <duch_kazatel> i am ready for some work beer.
[13:55:36] <BillCriswell> Beer sounds nice.
[13:58:40] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. Take care.

[15:17:12] <Sal> does anyone know where i can find horizontal scrolling tabs? something like this : http://www.pushing-pixels.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/steps.jpg
[15:19:03] <cpierce> sal
[15:19:06] <cpierce> it would take a little work
[15:19:10] <cpierce> but i think this would work for you
[15:19:30] <Sal> what?
[15:20:16] <cpierce> https://github.com/kenwheeler/browserSwipe
[15:21:56] <Sal> hmmm, a page sliding code
[15:22:01] <ngharo> Jacta: check your console.  timer is not defined lined 96
[15:22:14] <Sal> that will take some work to convert it to a tab scroller
[15:23:45] <Jacta> ngharo, even if I dont hoover and just type in console, its seems to work first time
[15:39:07] <Freeman186> Can some one help me with Gmaps JS question?
[15:47:52] <Freeman186> Can someone help me with Gmaps geocode method?
[15:50:24] <duch_kazatel> wow.  quiet today.
[15:50:41] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Freeman186
[15:50:41] <b-ot> Freeman186: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:07:02] <Freeman186> ok here goes: http://jsfiddle.net/eDj3r/ I am trying to Geocode a field on focus out, but I am doing so inside of a modal and the Geocode method is not being fired, no errors in console, I cant figure out why this isnt working
[16:07:58] <Freeman186> It works fine in the JSfiddle, but when I use it in a modal its not working
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> what modal are you using?
[16:08:37] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like things aren't binding properly on the modal?
[16:09:01] <Freeman186> I am using a Modal Manager plugin, and building the modal in AJAX
[16:09:54] <duch_kazatel> try init'ing this part after the modal fires.
[16:11:25] <Freeman186> I init it inside of the modal shouldnt that work?
[16:11:58] <duch_kazatel> something tells me the modal is getting cloned or otherwise munged when it launches.
[16:25:07] <Freeman186> Ripping my hair out, my focusout event fires, and even the handler fires, but the Gmaps.geocode does not work...
[16:25:24] <duch_workBeer> a working example would be nice.
[16:29:52] <Freeman186> @duch_workBeer http://laravel.io/bin/60JE this is my modal page
[16:30:06] <duch_workBeer> a functioning example :)
[16:31:05] <Freeman186> I posted a JS fiddle earlier, not sure how I can replicate my code without rewriting everything
[16:31:21] <duch_workBeer> the modal portion is what i'm curious about
[16:31:29] <duch_workBeer> any documentation i can look up?
[16:31:36] <duch_workBeer> or source code i can look at?
[16:32:30] <arxwn> Hello
[16:32:45] <duch_workBeer> hello.
[16:33:25] <arxwn> I use jquery sortable to sort the rows of a table BUT i want to use 2 sortables in the same table
[16:33:33] <Freeman186> https://github.com/jschr/bootstrap-modal
[16:33:34] <arxwn> some rows have a class folder
[16:33:40] <arxwn> and some a class product
[16:34:09] <arxwn> if I use sortable 2 times in js file it works only the second
[16:34:45] <arxwn> I have this
[16:34:48] <arxwn> $("#tbl tbody").sortable({containment: "#tbl",items:'.folder'});
[16:34:51] <duch_workBeer> !paste @ arxwn
[16:34:52] <b-ot> arxwn: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:34:53] <arxwn> $("#tbl tbody").sortable({containment: "#tbl",items:'.product'});
[16:35:01] <arxwn> only second works
[16:37:24] <duch_workBeer> yeah Freeman186 without really dumping through i'm guessing this modal replicates/clones/etc the code for the modal.  i'd try opening the modal, then doing your google funk and seeing if it works then.
[16:37:43] <Freeman186> thanks duch
[16:37:50] <Freeman186> going to take a break on this
[16:37:59] <Freeman186> try it with a fresh head
[16:42:33] <arxwn>  Please have a look http://jsfiddle.net/U4L85/
[16:43:08] <arxwn> folder tr does not sort with folders but with products
[16:44:08] <arxwn> Is this a jquery ui sortable bug?
[16:44:17] <duch_workBeer> likely not a bug
[16:44:36] <duch_workBeer> yeah you're resetting it after init.
[16:44:39] <duch_workBeer> that's as intended.
[16:45:14] <arxwn> So how to accomplish that folders sortable with folders and products with products?
[16:45:20] <duch_workBeer> huh?
[16:45:29] <duch_workBeer> you want to make everything sortable together?
[16:45:44] <arxwn> not everythin
[16:46:00] <arxwn> folder trs with folders
[16:46:09] <arxwn> and products trs with products only
[16:46:10] <duch_workBeer> and products with products?
[16:46:24] <arxwn> folders wioth folders only
[16:46:30] <arxwn> and products with products only
[16:46:32] <duch_workBeer> you'll have to change your code's structrure.
[16:46:56] <arxwn> the html?
[16:46:59] <duch_workBeer> yes
[16:47:13] <arxwn> how exactly?
[16:47:26] <duch_workBeer> 2 separate tables.
[16:47:32] <arxwn> cannot be done
[16:47:40] <arxwn> the html must be like this
[16:47:50] <arxwn> but the classes can change as wish
[16:47:52] <duch_workBeer> then you'll have to do it with jquery and then run sortable.
[16:48:10] <arxwn> ?
[16:48:40] <duch_workBeer> as far as I can tell, you cannot do what you want - you must split your two lists into two separate tables.  how you accomplish that is up to you.
[16:49:05] <arxwn> But what I am asking is not something strange I think
[16:49:18] <arxwn> jquery ui should be able to handle that
[16:49:19] <duch_workBeer> err, it kind of is.
[16:49:29] <duch_workBeer> you're asking for it to structure based on an ephemeral concept.
[16:50:15] <duch_workBeer> instead of a concrete one.
[16:50:37] <arxwn> xmmm
[16:50:42] <arxwn> perhaps I could
[16:50:47] <arxwn> do
[16:51:21] <arxwn> when i click on .folder tr the set the items to be .folder via sortable option
[16:51:27] <arxwn> $( ".selector" ).sortable( "option", "items", "> li" );
[16:51:30] <duch_workBeer> that doesn't make sense imo.
[16:51:40] <arxwn> and if click on products then set other items
[16:51:48] <arxwn> so there will be one sortable
[16:51:52] <duch_workBeer> you're going to have the same problems.
[16:53:24] <BillCriswell> WORKBEAR

[16:53:38] <arxwn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14092510/jquery-ui-sortable-tables-with-sets-of-rows
[16:53:48] <arxwn> Thats what I am asking
[16:53:54] <arxwn> a user asked it
[16:54:05] <duch_workBeer> arxwn cool?  that's almost exactly what I told you do do.
[16:54:07] <duch_workBeer> *to do.
[16:54:07] <arxwn> they propose to him to use more than one tbody
[16:54:15] <duch_workBeer> though I don't think that's valid.
[16:54:30] <arxwn> but is it xhtml to use more than one tbody in table?
[16:54:44] <duch_workBeer> nope.
[16:54:51] <duch_workBeer> afaik.  let me look
[16:55:23] <duch_workBeer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3076708/can-we-have-multiple-tbody-in-same-table
[16:55:28] <duch_workBeer> looks like i was wrong.
[16:56:13] <arxwn> Hmm nice
[16:56:14] <duch_workBeer> how goes BillCriswell?
[16:56:20] <arxwn> this should work now
[16:56:43] <arxwn> Ok thank you a lot
[16:56:47] <BillCriswell> It goes good. Eating some dinner, watching some TV.
[16:56:52] <duch_workBeer> thanks for lying, arxwn ;)
[16:57:14] <BillCriswell> You?
[16:57:38] <duch_workBeer> i'm all right. waiting on the keg at work.
[16:57:43] <duch_workBeer> had some good stouts today.
[16:57:57] <duch_workBeer> <arxwn> cannot be done <arxwn> the html must be like this <arxwn> but the classes can change as wish
[16:58:06] <duch_workBeer> just want to make sure everybody sees that ;)
[16:58:36] <arxwn> I meant noit to use 2 tables or more
[16:58:43] <duch_workBeer> then you should have said that ;)
[16:58:44] <arxwn> did not know about tbody
[16:58:58] <arxwn> yeah your right
[16:59:04] <arxwn> my mistake sorry
[17:00:12] <BillCriswell> Fucking stack overflow. Been at 4,998 karma all day.
[17:00:12] <BillCriswell> Just want 5K.
[17:09:01] <duch_workBeer> BillCriswell hahahaha.  soooo close.
[17:09:07] <duch_workBeer> i don't really hit up SO much these days.
[17:10:11] <BillCriswell> duch_workBeer: It's terrible.
[17:10:38] <BillCriswell> As soon as the question involves any thought most people just move along and the question gets forgotten about.
[17:11:25] <BillCriswell> Not to mention, people are typically terrible at asking questions.
[17:11:57] <duch_workBeer> truth,
[17:12:05] <duch_workBeer> folks want copy/paste, not "here's the why"
[17:12:34] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it sucks.
[17:13:11] <duch_workBeer> s'why i think there needs to be a "pragmatic javascripter" blog/podcast.
[17:13:40] <duch_workBeer> everybody seems obsessed with theory or with copy/paste.
[17:13:53] <duch_workBeer> there needs to be a clarion call of "here's how to GSD right, folks"
[17:14:45] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[17:15:00] <BillCriswell> Also teaching what not to do.
[17:15:15] <duch_workBeer> right!  and explaining why.
[17:15:26] <duch_workBeer> like, building that basis of theory so you know wtf you're doing.
[17:16:27] <BillCriswell> Kind of think that only comes with experience, though.
[17:16:56] <duch_workBeer> to an extent.  but practical application of, say fragments?
[17:17:02] <duch_workBeer> and a q/a section?
[17:17:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah that make ssense
[17:17:15] <duch_workBeer> i am an idealist.

[17:19:36] <BillCriswell> That's some fancy dancin.
[17:23:40] <duch_workBeer> somebody put on small soldiers.
[17:31:42] <BillCriswell> Updating a gravatar image is entirely too much work.
[17:32:12] <duch_workBeer> right?!  i never really "got" that whole thing.
[17:33:41] <BillCriswell> I'm glad github stopped using it.
[17:39:39] <BillCriswell> YEAHHH 5,013!
[17:39:46] <duch_workBeer> hahahahaha
[17:39:52] <duch_workBeer> is your life complete today?
[17:41:00] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[17:43:32] <duch_workBeer> mine isn't :(
[17:46:19] <BillCriswell> Why not?!
[17:46:38] <duch_workBeer> i'm still at work.  it's like 5:45 here
[17:46:41] <duch_workBeer> and i have to figure out dinner.
[17:46:43] <duch_workBeer> also: more beer
[17:48:10] <BillCriswell> Dinner is always a pain in the ass.
[17:52:43] <duch_workBeer> i'm find with the whole cooking/buying/whatevering.  it's the part about figuring it out.
[17:52:59] <BillCriswell> duch_workBeer: Yes, exactly.
[18:29:47] <guideX> I know this is css, but anyone know why .myclasss:before { content: "\e001"; } is not working?
[18:29:51] <guideX> in ie11
[18:31:35] <biyectivo> Hi
[18:32:29] <biyectivo> Throught the night I will be bugging you guys with questions :)
[18:33:35] <biyectivo> 1) On my jQuery Mobile page I'm trying to modify the a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active properties of regular <a>'s via a custom stylesheet, but apparently it is not honoring the styles even if I place !important on the style
[18:33:43] <biyectivo> any idea of how can I solve this?
[18:39:03] <shoky> guideX what's not working about it
[18:39:12] <guideX> it just isn't showing up
[18:39:18] <shoky> what do you expect to show up
[18:39:22] <shoky> it's an invalid character
[18:41:55] <guideX> well in  other browsers I see a >
[18:42:05] <shoky> i don't
[18:42:58] <shoky> why not put a > if you want that
[18:43:11] <guideX> well I'm using this.. content: "\e001" !important;
[18:43:29] <shoky> huh
[18:43:47] <shoky> what does that have to do with it being an invalid char
[18:43:57] <shoky> why did you put \e001 there
[18:44:23] <biyectivo> anyone actually in here?
[18:44:46] <shoky> yes, we're talking and stuff..
[18:48:43] <biyectivo> anyone here?
[18:48:46] <caleb_io> Yep
[18:48:54] <biyectivo> or are you all bots
[18:49:48] <caleb_io> Haha, definitely not a bot.
[18:49:57] <biyectivo> great
[18:50:18] <caleb_io> Need help with something/.
[18:50:20] <caleb_io> ?*
[18:50:25] <biyectivo> this is like the first actual human response I get from an IRC channel in like 10 years
[18:50:49] <caleb_io> Yeah, most people idle these days and never pay attention.
[18:50:52] <caleb_io> Kinda sad.
[18:52:02] <biyectivo> :)
[18:53:18] <caleb_io> this is the first time I've actually been on IRC in forever :\
[18:55:03] <biyectivo> caleb_io: any idea of why I cannot get jQuery Mobile to style my flipswitch on a popup?
[18:55:14] <biyectivo> it shows as a regular select (combobox)
[18:57:36] <caleb_io> What kind of popup?
[18:57:50] <caleb_io> Does it work when it's not in a popup?  Is jQuery mobile being loaded? Any script errors on the page?
[18:58:12] <caleb_io> Also what version of jQuery mobile are you on?
[18:59:01] <biyectivo> caleb_io any idea?
[18:59:15] <caleb_io> I replied above.
[19:02:29] <biyectivo> hi
[19:02:54] <biyectivo> latest version of JQM, it styles fine when not in the popup. I don't see any errors in the console (using latest Chrome).
[19:03:20] <biyectivo> sorry, my laptop keeps connecting and disconnecting from freenode.
[19:06:32] <caleb_io> No problem  What kind of popup is it?  A new window via window.open or a popup widget?
[19:07:08] <biyectivo> a popup widget
[19:07:12] <biyectivo> data-rel="popup"
[19:09:00] <biyectivo> wait
[19:09:07] <biyectivo> I forgot to tell you something important,
[19:09:21] <biyectivo> I'm creating the flipswitch dynamically via javascript (.append)
[19:13:00] <caleb_io> Yeah since it's happening after the DOM is loaded and ready you'll have to call it manually.
[19:13:28] <caleb_io> $('[data-role="flipswitch"]').flipswitch()
[19:13:36] <caleb_io> Or you can get more specific with the selector for just that one.
[19:18:32] <biyectivo> ok let me try that
[19:18:57] <biyectivo> what's the difference between the flipswitch() method and the refresh() method? (I was just reading in google)
[19:19:49] <biyectivo> it works! thanks caleb_io
[19:20:20] <biyectivo> now it doesn't render the switch correctly (not sure why) but that's another story hehe
[19:20:30] <caleb_io> No problem.  I'm not sure about the refresh method (I've never actually used jQuery mobile).
[19:21:51] <caleb_io> I think you may want the 'refresh' method on the flipswitch.
[19:22:01] <caleb_io> $('[data-role="flipswitch"]').flipswitch('refresh')
[19:22:17] <biyectivo> it works with the ();
[19:22:31] <biyectivo> is flipswitch() a shortcut for flipswitch('refresh')?
[19:25:45] <caleb_io> I don't think so.  I'm reading up about it now.
[20:02:38] <Rhomber> has anyone used backbone/require js with jquery mobile 1.4?
[21:49:57] <biyectivo> is there a built-in way to dim the background when calling a popup widget via jQuery Mobile?
[21:56:21] <biyectivo> sorry, disconnected... is there a built-in way to dim the background when calling a popup widget via jQuery Mobile?
[23:52:48] <Ventox> Hey, I have contactform on my website but for somereason when i click "Send from" It jumps: http://talgerafi.com/elsev2/ (Why?)
