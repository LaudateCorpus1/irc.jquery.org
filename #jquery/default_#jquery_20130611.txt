[00:14:44] <slick-> hi
[00:14:48] <slick-> anyone up
[00:14:50] <slick-> i need help
[00:15:42] <Eviltwin> Just ask your question, don't ask to ask
[00:16:41] <slick-> I'm dynamically adding rows, with a text box that is class = 'height'
[00:16:52] <slick-> $('.height').bind('input', function() { only works for the first instance
[00:16:56] <slick-> not any ones after
[00:17:05] <oojacoboo> slick-: bind is deprecated
[00:17:08] <oojacoboo> use .on()
[00:17:13] <slick-> will that work for all of them
[00:17:17] <slick-> and not the first?
[00:17:25] <Eviltwin> Use the delegation signature
[00:17:37] <Eviltwin> $(document).on('input', '.height', function() { ... })
[00:17:52] <slick-> i see
[00:17:53] <slick-> nice
[00:17:58] <Eviltwin> Although did you mean 'change' instead of 'input'?
[00:19:25] <slick-> hop input should do i think
[00:21:20] <slick-> wow
[00:21:22] <slick-> thanks guys
[00:21:24] <slick-> i love u all
[00:22:41] <anton164> Hi, I have a really weird bug in my jQuery code. When I call a .click() event from my code, it happens for a slight second, but then goes away and simply shows a 'highlight' as if you'd tabbed to that element in the browser
[00:22:57] <anton164> However if I write the same exact selector and .click() event in the console, it opens normally, it's a dropdown menu
[00:27:24] <xec_> ?demo @ anton164
[00:27:24] <b-ot> anton164: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:31:16] <anton164> Alright, give me a minute, creating a jsfiddle
[00:34:09] <xertion> If I want to subtract the left position of a element with ui.value (using jQuery UI), what is wrong with the following line: $('#canvas div').css('left', parseInt( $(this).css('left') )-ui.value + 'px'); ?
[00:34:33] <xertion> is $(this).css('left') wrong?
[00:34:53] <xertion> (I want to target the div that #canvas div is selecting)
[00:35:39] <Eviltwin> xertion: http://jsfiddle.net/TLNvn/
[00:36:13] <Eviltwin> I think you want .offset().left
[00:38:03] <anton164> Now, that's annoying, I created a fiddle and it works, I guess something else is causing the issue then
[00:38:20] <anton164> That helped me isolate it though, thanks
[00:54:16] <henn1nk> does someone know, why the function setCurrentPosition is fired on load? http://jsfiddle.net/FJsvV/
[00:57:21] <systemfault> Because you don't understand how function works..
[00:58:01] <systemfault> options.prevButton.bind('click', setCurrentPosition('prev')); is the same as:  var returnValue = setCurrentPosition('prev'); options.prevButton.bind(returnValue);
[00:58:39] <systemfault> Do you see what's wrong with that?
[00:59:46] <henn1nk> hm different to other languages
[01:00:09] <systemfault> Nope, it would be the exact same thing in all languages.
[01:01:01] <systemfault> What you want would be: options.prevButton.bind('click', function() { setCurrentPosition('prev'); });
[01:02:28] <xec_> henn1nk: you are executing the function and using the return value as the handler
[01:04:20] <henn1nk> ok
[01:22:43] <EdwardIII> hey, i'm using jQuery 2.0.2, but i'm seeing "SCRIPT445: Object doesn't support this action
[01:22:50] <EdwardIII> in internet explorer 8
[01:23:17] <xec_> EdwardIII: jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8
[01:23:23] <xec_> copypasta from http://jquery.com/download/
[01:26:39] <EdwardIII> oh, i see
[01:27:57] <EdwardIII> thanks xec_, sorry, should have been more observant!
[01:28:03] <xec_> :)
[01:30:46] <EdwardIII> now if i can just make page.js play ball heh: "Object doesn't support property or method 'addEventListener'"
[01:30:50] <EdwardIII> xec_: you still supporting IE8?
[01:32:02] <xec_> i don't really test in IE8 any more, but i'm not throwing them under the bus quite yet either (sticking with 1.x for now)
[01:32:21] <EdwardIII> yeah
[01:32:33] <EdwardIII> we have some level of support for it, pretty much just core-functionality-only though
[01:32:41] <EdwardIII> the thing has to be usable, but not necessarily beautiful
[01:33:02] <systemfault> Just use 1.x if you need i8 support.
[01:33:07] <systemfault> *ie8
[01:34:18] <xertion> I'm having issue with .resizable() from jQuery UI sets height: 0; and width: 0; on my image.
[01:34:21] <okdamn> hey how do i detect if user focus out of an element on mouseleave ?
[01:34:35] <xertion> so if I dont use resizable, the image displays fine, but when I add .resizable() to the element, it sets height and width to 0.
[01:34:38] <xertion> Anyone know why?
[01:34:40] <okdamn> on('mouseleave',function(){  if focused out of $(this) … })
[01:34:43] <okdamn> ?
[01:35:01] <xec_> ?demo @ xertion
[01:35:02] <b-ot> xertion: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:35:46] <xec_> okdamn: blur and mouseleave are two different things, what are you really trying to do (what is the use case)?
[01:36:06] <anton164> Let's see, I'm trying to unbind a click event as its clicked, e.g. so that it only works once, shouldn't this be correct? http://jsfiddle.net/k8nT9/
[01:36:32] <xertion> xec_: http://www.cupcard.com/designer-tool/ Go to "Library" and try to drag and drop Heart #2 on to the canvas. It creates the image fine but it sets height and width to 0. If you try example Heart #8 it works fine.
[01:36:42] <xertion> The problem is gone if I remove .resizable() from the image that is created on drop.
[01:36:45] <anton164> http://jsfiddle.net/k8nT9/1/ is more clear
[01:36:56] <okdamn> xec_:  thanks dude, i'm trying fadeOut() element if some other element is focused in the DOM
[01:37:03] <xec_> anton164: you can use .one() http://jsfiddle.net/k8nT9/2/
[01:37:10] <okdamn> think of a dropdown menu, if user focus out of menu i want to hide that :P
[01:37:38] <anton164> Awesome, xec_ one is awesome
[01:37:45] <anton164> jQuery has everything :p
[01:38:21] <okdamn> xec_:  understood mate? :P
[01:38:26] <okdamn> sorry for my english i'm italian :D
[01:38:31] <xec_> okdamn: focus is primarily for form fields
[01:38:44] <xec_> okdamn: (and is an event type of its own)
[01:38:46] <anton164> But xc_, will one work for dynamically created buttons?
[01:39:43] <okdamn> xec_:  may i need blur?
[01:40:17] <xec_> okdamn: if you're creating a popup menu, mouseleave should be sufficient on its own, what code do you have so far?
[01:40:48] <xec_> anton164: yes, it's the same syntax as .on()
[01:40:55] <xec_> ?one @ Antiga
[01:40:55] <okdamn> xec_:  i'm just fadeToggling the menu on <a> click
[01:41:04] <xec_> oops sorry Antiga, that was for anton164
[01:41:21] <okdamn> now i would like to fadeOut only when user focus on some DOM element !== popup menu
[01:41:21] <anton164> Thanks, yeah, I looked it up, but it seemed a bit different
[01:41:46] <anton164> I'll give it a go, though, thanks for your help!
[01:41:51] <fender0107401> I got something wrong. It works with firebug(I mean step and step), but does't work if I shutdown the firebug. :(
[01:43:02] <fender0107401> Is there anyone has similar experiences?
[01:44:23] <henn1nk> ok works pretty well. http://jsfiddle.net/FJsvV/8/ any optimizing ideas? :)
[01:44:26] <okdamn> xec_:  do you have any clue dude?
[01:46:58] <jnhghy> Hi, can you point me to an tutorial about scrollbar? I want something similar with the one here: http://www.insport.ro/ in the right, if you click on the 3rd tab: "Sambata, 15 Iunie" then it will apear.
[01:49:23] <okdamn> xec_:  http://pastebin.com/qqcC6Lhm this is what i would like to do
[01:49:36] <okdamn> on focusout of dropdown menu hide it
[01:49:38] <okdamn> :P
[01:49:41] <okdamn> but it won't work
[01:50:03] <Cork> jnhghy: what will appear?
[01:50:09] <jnhghy> the scrollbar
[01:50:51] <Cork> all i get is a normal one of the right
[01:52:05] <xec_> okdamn: try mouseleave instead (where did you get focusout from, anyway?)
[01:52:44] <okdamn> xec_:  click <a> show dropdown -> focusout from menu -> hide menu
[01:52:47] <xec_> xertion: the heart stays the same shape after dragging as far as i can see?
[01:52:47] <okdamn> need this :P
[01:53:25] <xec_> okdamn: read your messages
[01:53:25] <jnhghy> Cork: http://imgbin.org/index.php?page=image&id=14084: where you can see the mouse... that the scrollbar I want to create so that the content of the sectionContent will display in the desired height
[01:53:45] <xertion> xec_: I'm working on a solution atm, now I set width: auto; on the heart after it has been set to 0px from jQuery UI's resizable()
[01:54:00] <xertion> so atm, first resizable set height and width to 0 for some reason (That I'm trying to solve)
[01:54:06] <xertion> and then I set width and height to auto after that.
[01:54:16] <xec_> xertion: can you make a demo that illustrates the issue?
[01:54:40] <okdamn> xec_:  wot sorry? :P
[01:54:45] <xertion> I can remove my width and height: auto; if you want
[01:54:46] <xertion> and u can see.
[01:54:47] <xertion> sec.
[01:54:50] <xec_> okdamn: did you try mouseleave instead?
[01:54:58] <okdamn> mouseleave is not good i want to anyway let is shown on mouseleave
[01:55:00] <okdamn> :P
[01:55:29] <xec_> okdamn: so you want to hide it on click?
[01:55:42] <xertion> xec_: I removed my "fix" now, if you visit http://www.cupcard.com/designer-tool/ and press library in the top corner.
[01:55:48] <xertion> and then try to drag Heart #2 on to the Canvas.
[01:56:10] <xertion> What happens is that you drop it, a <img> is created and then that image has .resizable() called ot it. Resizable then set height and width to 0 as you can see in the source.
[01:56:13] <okdamn> xec_:  nope dude, when i show it on click -> then if user focus on element !== dropdown -> hide dropdown
[01:56:47] <xec_> okdamn: there is no focus on the element
[01:57:15] <xec_> okdamn: (mostly) focus is for form fields
[01:57:38] <xec_> xertion: still looks fine to me
[01:58:01] <xertion> What heart are you draging? Are you sure you refreshed with CTRL + R so that you're not caching my fix?
[01:58:54] <xec_> xertion: #2, yes, and both in ff&chrome
[01:59:13] <xec_> xertion: it seems to get height & width 153px
[01:59:23] <xec_> (after dragging)
[01:59:28] <xertion> Hmm ok, for me some hearts are working fine and some are set to width and height 0.
[01:59:39] <xertion> Well well.
[01:59:54] <xertion> I think my fix where I set auto after, will do fine until later.
[02:00:37] <xec_> xertion: it could be a race condition
[02:01:07] <xec_> xertion: maybe the browser hasn't had time to calculate the size before .resizable()  is called
[02:01:31] <xertion> I see.
[02:01:36] <xertion> So I should do an onload event?
[02:01:53] <xec_> you could try, and see if it makes a difference
[02:02:36] <xec_> but onload isn't too reliable iirc (won't fire if the image is cached)
[02:03:17] <xec_> not sure if this is still an issue, and what browsers. just vaguely recall reading something along those lines
[02:04:10] <jeremy-> Using jquery validate and assuming I've created my .validate() function... whats the best way to call this validation on a per field basis

[02:20:35] <warden23> Hello, http://jsfiddle.net/BV3TJ/ I have no idea where to start. I'm trying to get jquery to select the 'radio' button once I start typing in the textfield box?
[02:21:27] <Cork> warden23: by select you mean check?
[02:21:40] <warden23> yeah so the radio button is selected
[02:21:45] <warden23> I mean checked
[02:21:46] <warden23> :p
[02:23:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/BV3TJ/1/
[02:23:37] <Cork> hmm why on earth did i type ""...
[02:23:54] <warden23> Awesome, thank you :)
[02:24:01] <Cork> np
[02:24:25] <warden23> What's 'keyup'

[03:07:26] <joker_89> hi, if you have a query in mysql that returns the inner join of Menu and submenus dependence, what do you do to display the results in php?
[03:13:58] <seutje> joker_89: are you sure you're in the right channel?
[03:14:50] <joker_89> nop sorry
[03:19:22] <Niels__> sometimes this api returns an empty json array [], how do i check for that in jquery?
[03:20:21] <Niels__> if (data.length == 0) {} ?
[03:27:01] <jmmy> jeremy-, I just skipped it and used a plugin
[04:00:41] <Imaginativeone> how do I add my business logic to a query script?
[04:01:13] <jmmy> huh
[04:01:35] <jmmy> they have some mvc server javasripting
[04:15:00] <fella5s> hi, i have "$.get(url, input, function(data){/*processing*/});" and im wondering how i should implement callbacking. For now, only way i have managed to get things working is when i put "callback()" after "/*processing*/". Is this correct way to do this?
[04:15:45] <Cork> fella5s: "callbacking" as in?
[04:16:03] <Cork> do you need to process the date before the callback is called?
[04:16:18] <fella5s> exactly yes
[04:16:50] <Cork> then yes you want to call the callback after that
[04:17:03] <Cork> you could also use $.Callbacks if you prefer that
[04:17:17] <Cork> but it's basically the same thing
[04:17:58] <fella5s> i've been coding jquery for couple of days so i don't know all the twists yet :)
[04:18:07] <Cork> ?.callbacks
[04:18:11] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".callbacks" in jQuery Docs.
[04:18:16] <Cork> ?jquery.Callbacks
[04:18:25] <Cork> sigh
[04:18:34] <Cork> ?g jquery.Callbacks
[04:18:34] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.Callbacks() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[04:19:37] <fella5s> so this is ok to do? function(data){/*processing*/; callback();}
[04:19:43] <Cork> yes
[04:19:54] <fella5s> thanks
[04:20:10] <Cork> or callback.call(variable-to-us-as-this) if you want to se
[04:20:27] <Cork> +t the this variable
[04:24:33] <fella5s> This javascript and jquery etc is so hard to understand after years of only java programming.
[04:25:05] <jmmy> huh, what you talking, you don't understand its application I think, besides that, it same programming as any language
[04:25:41] <EdwardIII> well you don't have a lot of functional stuff in java
[04:25:46] <jmmy> fella5s, have you head of the dom.  Just about the elements on a page.
[04:26:09] <EdwardIII> .each, map, stuff like that is probably confusing if you've never seen it before
[04:26:43] <jmmy> in java you just have for(), I think they've added some more looping techniques by now haven't they?
[04:35:17] <fella5s> Theres lots of similarity ofc with every language. I've just starting to get into to js and jquery. And I do lot of java too, so sometimes things get messy in my head.
[04:35:41] <jmmy> maybe you need Jesus
[04:38:43] <fella5s> or, i just need to understand all this "functional programming" -stuff.
[04:39:12] <jmmy> fella5s, have you heard of eloquent javascript.  Its a really good book
[04:39:39] <jmmy> http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[04:39:54] <fella5s> now i have
[04:43:50] <seutje> learn something new every day!
[04:45:14] <seutje> fella5s: I know the feeling, if I had a penny for every time I wrote "var" in PHP...
[04:45:46] <Cork> don't forget var_dump in js :D
[04:53:12] <Leukocyt> Hi Guys! Quick question. I've used $('#mySelect').live('change',function(){}); for a long time, but now (with jquery 2.0) live is replaced with .on(). I load a form with ajax and i've got this select in the form. I want to trigger a event when this checkbox is changed. If i use .changed() it won't work, cause the DOM is already loaded. So, what should i use instead of .live in jquery 2?
[04:53:54] <Cork> Leukocyt: first notice that both 1.9 and 2.0 is the current version
[04:53:59] <AeroNotix> why is the documentation site always so utterly horrendously slow?
[04:54:03] <Cork> 1.9 if you need older ie support
[04:54:26] <Cork> Leukocyt: live has been replaced by delegate since 1.5, on has a syntax for that too
[04:54:37] <Cork> (and no on isn't a replacement for live)
[04:54:42] <Cork> ?.delegate @ Leukocyt
[04:54:43] <bot-t> Leukocyt, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:54:52] <Leukocyt> Cork: Ok, thanks! Found it :D
[04:55:03] <Cork> AeroNotix: you mean api.jquery.com ?
[04:55:20] <AeroNotix> Cork: yes
[04:55:27] <Cork> AeroNotix: loads quick here
[04:55:30] <AeroNotix> hmm
[04:55:40] <AeroNotix> Always really, really, REALLY slow at work
[04:55:45] <AeroNotix> 10s+ to load a page
[04:55:50] <Cork> AeroNotix: make a traceroute
[04:57:56] <AeroNotix> hmm, doesn't really tell me much
[04:58:33] <Cork> look for a slow node
[05:00:06] <AeroNotix> I know what I am looking for, they're all pretty quick when I traceroute it
[05:00:23] <mrHAT> ok, so i have about 20 inputs like this: <input type="text" name="newstock[{$prodID}]" value="{$newstock}" /> how do i get all inputs and construct an object in the form of {prodID:newstock, prodID:newstock...};
[05:01:06] <Cork> ?g serializeObject @ mrHAT
[05:01:06] <b-ot> mrHAT: Sorry, no results for ‟serializeObject @ mrHAT”.
[05:01:07] <bot-t> mrHAT, jQuery .serializeObject is not a function - only in Firefox - Stack ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8900587/jquery-serializeobject-is-not-a-function-only-in-firefox
[05:01:13] <Cork> uh...
[05:01:17] <Cork> ?g jquery.serializeObject @ mrHAT
[05:01:18] <b-ot> mrHAT: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery.serializeObject @ mrHAT”.
[05:01:18] <bot-t> mrHAT, serializeObject() - jQuery Forum - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/serializeobject
[05:01:49] <Cork> mrHAT: serializeArray can get you quite close, but not all the way
[05:02:14] <mrHAT> but how do i 'collect' all inputs ?
[05:02:26] <jmmy> $('input')
[05:02:26] <Cork> ?.serializeArray
[05:02:27] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[05:02:31] <Cork> no not input
[05:02:52] <Cork> serializeArray or serializeObject (plugin)
[05:03:05] <jmmy> yeah serializeArray is sweet
[05:03:35] <Cork> something like var obj = {}; $.each($('form').serializeArray(), function(elm) { obj[elm[0]] = elm[1]; });
[05:03:42] <Cork> is what serializeObject does
[05:04:37] <mrHAT> is that reliable ?
[05:05:14] <Cork> the plugin does some more checks that you most likely want
[05:05:33] <Cork> mrHAT: but before we go too deep into this; why do you need it?
[05:05:54] <jmmy> what checks?
[05:06:30] <Cork> jmmy: https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject/blob/master/jquery.serializeObject.js#L23
[05:06:32] <mrHAT> i need to post some changes using ajax
[05:06:39] <jmmy> Cork, thx
[05:06:49] <Cork> mrHAT: then just use serializeArray or serialize()
[05:06:51] <mrHAT> so i need to collect input values
[05:06:54] <mrHAT> and then post
[05:06:55] <Cork> ajax takes them as data points
[05:07:09] <Cork> $.post(url, $('form').serialize());
[05:07:20] <Cork> $.post(url, $('form').serializeArray());
[05:07:24] <jmmy> frig man...I can't read that code
[05:07:43] <Cork> jmmy: that code is fairly decent
[05:07:55] <Cork> and the link was for the comments
[05:07:57] <mrHAT> why can´t i just select all inputs by the name selector
[05:08:09] <jmmy> Cork, yes, I am not up to par, above my pay scale,
[05:08:18] <Cork> mrHAT: cause that is what serialize does
[05:08:22] <mrHAT> sorry attribute
[05:08:39] <mrHAT> but why would i select something i do not want
[05:08:42] <Cork> mrHAT: if you mean why the form; it's cause you should always ALWAYS have a form
[05:08:58] <Cork> mrHAT: you don't want to send the entire form?
[05:09:00] <mrHAT> Cork who imposes that
[05:09:01] <mrHAT> you ?
[05:09:09] <mrHAT> because w3c dosent
[05:09:14] <Cork> mrHAT: cause if you don't you break the web
[05:09:21] <Cork> mrHAT: well accessibility does yes
[05:09:24] <mrHAT> who sais that
[05:09:29] <Cork> ...
[05:09:33] <mrHAT> show me the standard specs on that
[05:09:38] <Cork> if you actually ever tried that you would know
[05:09:43] <mrHAT> and the entity that imposes it
[05:10:08] <Cork> an input without a form doesn't make sense in the html spec
[05:10:18] <Cork> cause there is nothing to hold the fields
[05:10:20] <screamingbanshee> @mrHAT srsly dude just Cork is pretty much always right, just go with it... he's not tryna trick you lol
[05:11:19] <Cork> mrHAT: just to name ONE example, a login page without a form around the user and password, can't trigger the credential fill features cross browsers
[05:12:05] <Cork> the native flow for how forms work in the specific browser, depends on the form element
[05:12:15] <Cork> and so on
[05:12:20] <infoget> Hi, I need help, I call  function from two elements (in textarea with onkeydown and in button with onclick), but I don't know how can I trigger function only when is pressed ENTER or clicked on the button. pls help
[05:13:14] <Cork> infoget: you would have to check the event.keyCode in the keydown event
[05:13:49] <Cork> infoget: or as i have a little feeling, you might want to use a form and the submit event around the elements instead
[05:14:03] <Cork> infoget: if you are trying to trigger an ajax call for those actions
[05:14:43] <Cork> funny how questions often comes in pair :)
[05:15:07] <infoget> Cork: thx for reply, I have simple chat system, and I would like trigger function with clicked button or when is pressed Enter.
[05:15:25] <Cork> infoget: and the button is for sending the message?
[05:15:30] <infoget> yes
[05:15:58] <Cork> <form><textarea><input type="submit"></form> $('form').submit(function() { $.ajax() });
[05:16:16] <Cork> use the submit event on the form instead of click on the submit button
[05:16:31] <Cork> and the rest should just work
[05:17:47] <infoget> Cork: thx!
[05:17:53] <Cork> hmm no, submit isn't triggered from textareas
[05:18:09] <Cork> infoget: though the submit is still a "more correct" solution
[05:18:16] <Cork> but you would have to handle the textarea in code
[05:18:54] <hemangpatel> Morning
[05:19:13] <seutje> if pressing enter submits the form, what's the point of using a textarea? why not use a large text input?
[05:19:16] <shafox> hi, i have one form where the google maps latitude and longitude are stored in two hidden input fields. i tried to do this $('#latitude').keyup('click', function() {
[05:19:17] <shafox>   console.log($(this).val());
[05:19:17] <shafox> }); but its showing me null value. what is the method to call on change of the value from null to something it will give that value only ?
[05:19:30] <Cork> infoget: http://jsfiddle.net/TCBtm/
[05:19:52] <Cork> (and yes this does ctrl+enter for submit from the textarea)
[05:20:40] <hemangpatel> How do i get timezone of user ?
[05:20:54] <Cork> from Date
[05:20:58] <seutje> date - utc?
[05:21:15] <granden> Hi, I'm trying to make a slider. And have come so far that it auto slides. But now when trying to add user interaction when they hover the thumbnails bellow the main div. I dont really now how to do. http://pastebin.com/yxSiUr6k, my code looks like that now. But if just copy pasteing what happens in the setInterval then the slides fucks upp if I'm fast and swipes over all thumbnails at once.
[05:21:19] <infoget> Cork: thx
[05:21:32] <Cork> ?eval (new Date).getTimezoneOffset()
[05:21:34] <bot-t> Cork: -330
[05:22:12] <hemangpatel> is this perfect ? http://pellepim.bitbucket.org/jstz/
[05:22:13] <seutje> oh right, it actually has the offset on it
[05:22:56] <Cork> hemangpatel: then you would have to have a database matching the offset to a database
[05:23:05] <Cork> and those databases needs to be updated quite often
[05:23:35] <hemangpatel> Cork : info for getTimezoneOffset() please
[05:23:46] <Cork> ?g mdn Date
[05:23:46] <b-ot> Cork: Date - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[05:23:47] <bot-t> Cork, Date - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[05:47:19] <granden> Any one who got input on how I should do on the hover function ? http://jsfiddle.net/AS3Nu/1/
[05:47:33] <granden> Works correct when it slides automaticlly. But with user interaction it all fails.
[05:55:11] <mrHAT> ok, so i´ve made up a fiddle to better illustrate my earlier problem...
[05:55:12] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/h3J3Q/
[05:56:49] <goldstar> i have the following variable: var a = "do=1&e=2" - How do I change do to do=10 ?
[05:58:59] <mrHAT> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values
[05:59:01] <mrHAT> use this
[06:00:50] <mrHAT> you usually parse the query string, change what you need and use the new query
[06:01:35] <mrHAT> anyway... can anyone look over the fiddle i pasted please
[06:07:13] <mrHAT> it´s not possible what i want isn´t it
[06:07:16] <mrHAT> :(
[06:07:32] <jmmy> all the riches of the world?
[06:07:55] <mrHAT> no
[06:08:00] <mrHAT> what i asked in the fiddle
[06:08:02] <mrHAT> damn
[06:08:18] <jmmy> mrHAT, what are you trying to do?
[06:08:24] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/h3J3Q/
[06:08:44] <mrHAT> see comment
[06:08:47] <jmmy> I have it, but maybe you could quickly tell me what is happenning or what you're trying to do
[06:09:16] <mrHAT> i want to post the data you saw there as a json formatted string
[06:09:32] <mrHAT> but formatted as in my example
[06:10:28] <jmmy> it can be done
[06:10:40] <mrHAT> how
[06:11:24] <jmmy> hmmm, You are way ahead of me
[06:11:59] <mrHAT> what?
[06:12:37] <jmmy> where's name coming from?
[06:12:52] <mrHAT> lol
[06:15:53] <remybach> I think you might just have to manually build that object to look the way you need.
[06:15:54] <jmmy> mrHAT, you need some json tools maybe
[06:16:56] <mrHAT> then serialize it´s a bad option here
[06:17:47] <jmmy> mrHAT, maybe, or serialize done first part of your job and now you need some other utilities to format your data to your liking.  Also, there is another more advanced serialize plugin that might help you more
[06:18:59] <remybach> I don't think serializeArray is a bad option, it gives you what you need to loop over so you can construct your object.
[06:19:00] <mrHAT> ´pfft
[06:19:23] <remybach> That way you can add more inputs as you need without having to refactor your JS.
[06:19:29] <mrHAT> i would need to parse the newstock[nnn] as a string heh
[06:19:30] <jmmy> http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
[06:19:38] <mrHAT> that sucks
[06:20:20] <jmmy> I don't have any json experience to help you, sorry, but I think you can do it
[06:20:26] <mrHAT> also.. there is no longer any consistance in the data
[06:20:40] <Venko> Hey all, I want to replace a JavaScript prompt window with a jquery/ui component so that I can have a multi-line input/textarea. But all of the examples I've seen show/hide existing html. In my case I can only touch the Javascript click event on a button. Could someone point me in the direction of how I'd insert the html dialog/prompt overlay onto the page?
[06:20:53] <mrHAT> damn it
[06:21:07] <remybach> name.match(/([0-9]+)/)[1] will give you the number in the name. You'll probably want to do some sanity checking though.
[06:22:25] <mrHAT> where is the expert in here
[06:22:26] <mrHAT> lol
[06:22:46] <remybach> @Venko: using $('.body').append()?
[06:22:58] <jmmy> mrHAT, look within
[06:23:07] <jmmy> the expert is you
[06:23:16] <jmmy> lol
[06:24:49] <jmmy> I am not too familiar with json, but can't you take your json data as a string, and manipulate it?
[06:25:12] <Venko> @remybach: Thanks I'll take a look at this function :)
[06:25:25] <remybach> JSON.stringify will turn an object into a valid JSON object, and JSON.parse will do it the other way around.
[06:25:40] <remybach> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[06:25:56] <remybach> and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
[06:26:27] <remybach> * I mean stringify will turn an object into a valid JSON *string*
[06:26:28] <remybach> (doh)
[06:28:12] <mrHAT> dude
[06:28:16] <mrHAT> that is not the issue
[06:29:52] <seba4> hi there. I got some code that almost works.
[06:29:53] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/seba4/5756822
[06:30:24] <seba4> only problem i have is that if i go out of div and then back inside. it loads again even if first is not finished yet
[06:31:45] <remybach> @mrHAT, you're just going to have to loop over the array that `.serializeArray` gives you and manually build your object I think.
[06:32:35] <remybach> @seba4 You might want to look into the hoverIntent plugin.
[06:33:55] <remybach> http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[06:36:25] <godhack> I've a problem :( I tried to add two of these: http://koesbong.com/clients/self/codingtest/ but the 2nd todo-list doesn't keep it's entry values. Every entry is "null" on the 2nd list. here's my try http://jsfiddle.net/SXekz/
[06:43:50] <c4ptnh00k2> morning
[07:15:45] <jop008> How do I prepopulate a form field using jqMobile?
[07:22:19] <c4ptnh00k2> jop008: depends
[07:22:45] <c4ptnh00k2> where is the data coming from that you want to prepopulate?
[07:22:50] <jop008> on what it depends
[07:23:07] <jop008> the data is from db field.<first name>
[07:23:27] <jop008> I read this     $('input[name="total"]').val(total)
[07:23:52] <c4ptnh00k2> that is correct
[07:23:53] <mrHAT> done
[07:23:54] <mrHAT> http://jsfiddle.net/h3J3Q/5/
[07:24:08] <mrHAT> this is what i came with
[07:24:31] <jop008> but also used this  $("#remark")[0].value   = "";
[07:24:40] <mrHAT> does not use serialize (not that i had something with using serialize but i have not been able to do it the elegant way with it)
[07:24:53] <jop008> what syntax is the correct one?
[07:24:58] <jop008> or both are fine?
[07:25:16] <c4ptnh00k2> .val() should be used
[07:25:37] <jop008> strange the other code works also in one of my sites
[07:25:45] <jop008> and not in a new site
[07:26:26] <c4ptnh00k2> what version on jq?
[07:27:30] <c4ptnh00k2> mrhat: had much practice with obfuscation lol
[07:27:41] <jop008> atest one 1.3.1

[07:35:39] <moldy> hi
[07:35:52] <moldy> is there a better way to write this? http://pastebin.com/NHb8XFiK
[07:37:20] <c4ptnh00k2> moldy: looks fine
[07:37:32] <shoky> moldy: just a tiny bit better.. http://pastebin.com/xa9sXyt3
[07:37:48] <moldy> thanks
[07:38:17] <moldy> i don't quite like the fact that i am hiding all the elements and then immediately show a subset of them
[07:39:17] <moldy> i have been trying to construct something like $("sidebar li ul").filter(smart_stuff_here).hide(), but had no success so far
[07:39:41] <shoky> moldy:  the ul's are the children of the li's?
[07:40:25] <moldy> yes, it's a nested list
[07:40:29] <shoky> moldy: and the a.active-category  are they inside the ul's? cant understand it from your code
[07:41:19] <moldy> here is the actual html: http://pastebin.com/PTNMCyF1
[07:42:01] <shoky> ah
[07:42:36] <c4ptnh00k2> 42
[07:44:41] <c4ptnh00k> moo
[07:48:37] <shoky> moldy: its not shorter but.. http://pastebin.com/fg0UCqYY
[07:48:48] <shoky> bit more efficient ;S
[07:48:49] <^^jfc^^> hello there, I've found this script to create a Feature slider http://jsfiddle.net/nmbUU/ with the function  afterCss I can work with the elemnts after the main one.

[07:49:09] <moldy> shoky: ah, thanks
[07:52:02] <godhack> hi
[07:52:19] <godhack> how do I read the localstorage values back from another window? http://koesbong.com/clients/self/codingtest/js/base.js
[07:52:26] <godhack> that's the script I use
[07:52:27] <jop008> This line works $("#insertion")[0].value = field["insertion"]
[07:52:45] <jop008> but this not $("#christian name")[0].value = field["insertion"]
[07:53:08] <jop008> are spaces in form field names causing problems?
[07:53:43] <jop008> can this be tweaked (not changing my db and html pages with form fields)
[07:53:46] <NoiseEee> jop008: use jquery.
[07:53:59] <jop008> What do you mean?
[07:54:06] <NoiseEee> jop008: $('#christian_name).val(field['insertion']);
[07:54:41] <jop008> so using an underscore you mean for the spaces?
[08:00:00] <seutje> jop008: technically, an ID is allowed to contain a space, but the selector engine will detect that as being "find me a child of the element with ID christian, and this child has to be of element type <name>"
[08:00:25] <seutje> so you'd either have to escape the space in the selector, or be reasonable and change it to an underscore :P
[08:01:01] <jop008> so a bug/ or feature?
[08:01:17] <seutje> I'd say works as designed
[08:01:26] <seutje> as specified, even
[08:02:01] <seutje> `g id attribute got more classy
[08:02:02] <b-ot> seutje: The id attribute got more classy in HTML5 · Mathias Bynens → http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/html5-id-class
[08:02:33] <seutje> jop008: http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/html5-id all valid
[08:02:36] <seutje> all bad ideas
[08:03:46] <Saaether> who would use those as id's o.O
[08:04:11] <jop008> Can I use _ in stead of space in the code or must I change the form name itself
[08:04:40] <jop008> like this cstmnt = "$(\"#"+ attrName.replace (" ","_") +"\")[0].value = field[\""+ attrName +"\"]";
[08:04:44] <jop008> used in eval expression
[08:04:57] <seutje> jop008: nah, it has to match the actual attr
[08:05:17] <jop008> jeg changing the db and the form
[08:05:22] <seutje> if the attr has a space, u'll need to escape it in the CSS/JS or you will need to change it to an underscore in the html
[08:05:22] <cwatson> I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I'm animating via links but it seems like it's not working. - http://jsfiddle.net/EBNeM/
[08:05:35] <jedimind> just because you _can_ do something, doesn't mean you should
[08:05:38] <jedimind> re: those IDs
[08:06:03] <jop008> Can I run a mysql script to replace column fields with _ in stead of space?
[08:06:54] <seutje> jedimind: yeah, that was my point
[08:08:16] <markgm> is there a seperate channel for jqm or is this it?
[08:08:31] <Saaether> this is it
[08:08:43] <seutje> cwatson: think it might be because there is no initial value for the "left" property
[08:09:03] <markgm> okay, well does anyone know when 1.4 for jqm will be released?
[08:09:03] <seutje> cwatson: so you're essentially telling jQuery to animate 'auto' to 'auto-960'
[08:09:54] <cwatson> seutje: 960 is not a value?
[08:10:27] <seutje> cwatson: what's 'auto' minus 960?
[08:10:46] <cwatson> seutje: undefined?
[08:10:51] <seutje> or rather, what's the distance of a single tick going from auto to auto - 960?
[08:11:08] <seutje> try setting the left prop to 0 to begin with
[08:11:18] <seutje> 0-960 is something that can actually be calculated
[08:11:38] <cwatson> seutje: Why does the first one work?
[08:11:55] <seutje> could very well be that jQuery is clever enough to determine the actual position of this 'auto' and substract 960 from it, but iirc, it didn't use to do that
[08:12:10] <cwatson> seutje: Ah, thanks man!
[08:12:40] <seutje> cwatson: well, the second click doesn't do anything cause ur clicking a different element that doesn't have a handler on it
[08:13:12] <cwatson> Yeah, it does. I have a click handler in an ID on that element.
[08:13:13] <parapooper> hi all

[09:05:11] <infoget> Hi, How can I select dynamic generated divs, e.g "#div_1, #div_2, #div_3, #div_4 ... #div_n"? Thx for reply
[09:06:49] <vsync_> infoget: why won't you just add e.g. a class to them
[09:07:56] <vsync_> when they are generated, that is, or is it impossible in this case
[09:08:20] <remybach> +1 for adding a class to them - if you *absolutely* can't though (and *only* if you can't) you could do: $("[id^=div]")
[09:10:08] <vsync_> yeah i guess regexing it is the only option then
[09:10:27] <remybach> That's not regexing… that's CSSing...
[09:10:37] <remybach> http://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/
[09:11:28] <infoget> vsync_: Hello, thx, it is also solution :), I am curious, is it possible with regular expressions?

[09:12:14] <Swimming_Bird> @godhack "\n|
[09:12:17] <Swimming_Bird> @godhack "\n"
[09:12:19] <godhack> \n doesn't work
[09:12:31] <Swimming_Bird> what are you trying to do?
[09:12:32] <godhack> Swimming_Bird: I'm changing the content of a texarea
[09:12:39] <remybach> Try \r\n
[09:12:42] <godhack> ah
[09:13:23] <remybach> \r is for a windows return
[09:13:49] <remybach> Not 100% sure that'll work btw.
[09:14:03] <godhack> remybach: that doesn't work.
[09:14:16] <godhack> in php it's chr(10);
[09:14:34] <snover> in php it’s "\n", too…
[09:14:54] <godhack> I tried var groupb =a+"<br>"+b+"<br>"+c+"<br>"+d; AND groupb.split(/\n/g).reverse(),
[09:15:07] <godhack> that results in awkward lines
[09:15:08] <Bloomberg> hello guys!!
[09:15:18] <Bloomberg> Someone has  worked with datatables plugin?
[09:16:15] <themojowill> whats the best way to grab the value of <dd id="myId"> and pass it to a form field? $('#formfieldID').val($('#ddId')); returns  [object Object]
[09:17:44] <Bloomberg> $("#myId").val()
[09:18:25] <themojowill> Bloomberg i want to pass contents of <dd> to <input>
[09:18:44] <Bloomberg> What are you doing?
[09:19:34] <vsync_> $('input').val($('#myId').val); ?
[09:20:06] <themojowill> vsync_ .val() isn't for dd?
[09:20:19] <vsync_> huh?
[09:20:59] <vsync_> if .val() is left empty, it returns the value, and if not it will set the value
[09:21:39] <vsync_> oh ye, soz i meant:
[09:21:42] <vsync_> $('input').val($('#myId').val()); ?
[09:21:45] <vsync_> there we go
[09:21:55] <vsync_> I think, :p
[09:22:19] <themojowill> yes but can you get .val() from a definition list item? it is meant to only get values from form elemtns
[09:24:16] <vsync_> oh yep. can't get those of course
[09:25:08] <themojowill> and .text() doesn't seem to return anything???
[09:25:28] <vsync_> are you like, generating the list on the go?
[09:25:38] <edannenbe> hi, anyone know why $('foo').show() might work in FF but not in chrome or ie? if i call the snippet from chrome console it works oddly
[09:25:39] <themojowill> yeah
[09:25:59] <themojowill> list populated from a previous ajax callback
[09:26:34] <vsync_> .text() should do the trick
[09:27:39] <themojowill> yeah it does the trick if I use a field with actual contents! :O dumbass moment over
[09:28:01] <vsync_> same

[09:49:04] <aftab> Hello, is there a way to use $.ajaxForm with multiple forms which are clones of each other but each of them upload file only when the upload button on each form is clicked on
[09:51:16] <mehwork> For mobile, is it more performant to have multiple data-* attributes in a tag or just one that consists of json?
[09:51:55] <aftab> Here is the code I am using but it is not working :( http://pastebin.ca/2395938
[09:53:03] <remybach> First of all, you don't need to do the .each… just doing $('.uploadform').on() will do.
[09:53:16] <remybach> Second: You're looking for the delegate function.
[09:53:23] <infoget> Hello I have lots of  hidden (display=none) divs inside of page, but one of them is displayed, how can I access to displayed div?
[09:53:44] <remybach> Reason being that you're cloning the forms after you've bound the original even so when you clone it, it's not carrying across the events.
[09:54:08] <remybach> @infoget: $('div:visible')
[09:55:45] <aftab> remybach: I understand about the clone forms but I can't even make it to run the first form without cloning
[09:56:34] <aftab> does $(".uploadform").on("submit", function () { });  work with $.ajaxForm or I am doing it wrong ?
[09:56:54] <NoiseEee> aftab: no, has nothing to do with ajax/xhr
[09:56:56] <infoget> remybach: thx, this is also correct? $('.class-out:visible > class-in').val();
[09:57:46] <aftab> it works fine with $.ajax but unfortunately i couldn't find the uploadprogress with it
[09:58:02] <remybach> @infoget: I'm not sure - would need to see the html.
[09:59:53] <Pupeno> Is there a way to make jquerymobile not modify input submits? I need to style it myself and I don't want to fight jquery mobile.
[10:00:28] <remybach> @aftab: try $('.uploadform').delegate('submit', function(e) { /* your code */ });
[10:00:59] <aftab> remybach: ok thanks let me try it
[10:01:14] <remybach> As for ajaxForm, I haven't used it much so I'm not sure if there's any specific to that. (sorry)
[10:01:43] <jmmy> Pupeno, you can dig through the css files, you can override, and I think there might be versions available unstyled. Not sure if that was bootstrap but probably someone has done it for jquery ui too
[10:01:53] <jmmy> But if you not using those styles why use the ui
[10:02:04] <Pupeno> jmmy: the answer is actually data-role="none"
[10:03:12] <aftab> remybach: may be this will help understanding what the problem is .. this one is just for single form and it works fine with ajaxForm http://pastebin.ca/2395947
[10:03:13] <jmmy> Pupeno, sorry for misleading you
[10:03:23] <Pupeno> no problem, this is confusing.
[10:03:39] <jmmy> Pupeno, data-role="none" isn't confusing is it?
[10:04:13] <aftab> And I am trying to make it work for multiple forms with classes instead of ids because there are duplicate forms
[10:04:16] <Saaether> data-cheeseburger="delicious"
[10:04:39] <jmmy> Saaether, can you do that.  You do data-anything?
[10:04:45] <Saaether> yup
[10:04:55] <NoiseEee> mehwork: i'm not sure there'd be a perceptible difference in querying an elements "data-" node vs a lookup via JSON
[10:04:57] <jmmy> Saaether, thx for the post my man, you alright
[10:05:14] <Pupeno> jmmy: I thought data-role="none" would have prevented other functionality as well.
[10:05:41] <NoiseEee> mehwork: the nice thing about the JSON approach is cleaner markup and also lets you create/develop a JSON-based API where you can get that related data via another page/app etc
[10:06:05] <jmmy> Pupeno, what kinda a button did you wanna make?
[10:06:43] <remybach> @aftab: Hmmm… you might just need to abstract out the binding to a function that receives the form element and then pass the cloned form to that?
[10:07:19] <aftab> remybach: any example please ?
[10:08:41] <Saaether> jmmy http://jsfiddle.net/nqV5N/ =)
[10:10:03] <mehwork> NoiseEee: yeah
[10:12:23] <jmmy> lol
[10:13:01] <remybach> Really sorry @aftab, but I'm late for an appointment and have to run :s
[10:13:29] <aftab> remybach: no problem thank you

[11:16:43] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to have an unload event that performs a different action if they say 'ok' to a confirm box? i want to be able to remind the user to save the page data for later, which needs to go to a totally different url than where they may be going. is this possible?
[11:17:10] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: no
[11:18:29] <tomasm-> NoiseEee, is there a way I can call a function via onbeforeunload? Step one is prompting them to not leave the page. I'm curious if they decide not to leave then if there's a way to do another task immediately after instead of just remaining on the page...
[11:32:36] <tomasm-> is it possible on an window.unload to submit the form to a new window, such as when I want them to log in and save their data?
[11:34:58] <surfdue> does anyone in here have experience with twitter typeahead?
[11:51:40] <shoky> surfdue: just ask
[11:52:15] <surfdue> for some reason, its ignoring my url in remote and instead trying to retrieve the json results on the current page url.
[11:54:27] <shoky> surfdue: code plz
[11:56:37] <surfdue> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vEjub/
[11:57:11] <surfdue> shoky: im in the typeahead script and logging the remote urls, it's set properly all the way up to the $.ajax call.
[11:58:40] <shoky> surfdue: er i thought you meant bootstrap typeahead
[11:59:02] <surfdue> nope this one https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js
[12:01:08] <tpyo> sry if this is the wrong place, just wondering if anyone knew of a good lib for draggable/resizable panes
[12:05:58] <shoky> surfdue: welp i donno that one, but, why name: ''  ?
[12:06:19] <surfdue> merp, i set it to csid anything i put there still does not fix it :/
[12:13:29] <shoky> surfdue: using jquery 1.7?  Note: typeahead.js has a dependency on jQuery 1.9+, which must be loaded before typeahead.js.
[12:13:44] <surfdue> shoky: switched it to 2.0.2 no  luck still
[12:13:59] <surfdue> shoky: i thought that was the issue at first, but nope
[12:14:39] <shoky> surfdue:  seems to be loading the right urls here  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vEjub/1/
[12:15:22] <surfdue> the strangest thing is that the prefix works fine, just not the remote
[12:15:33] <shoky> both work fine in the fiddle
[12:15:43] <Kolorbon> Hello ;) Is there a possible way to "observe" a database by using jquery, so instead of sending n requests with setinterval, to send one observer request and the php code returns every change of db?
[12:16:04] <shoky> surfdue: does your server really expect you to be fetching  query_here.json  ?
[12:16:38] <ryorky1> I gkeep getting an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'parent' of null  error when trying to access my json response data:  here is my pastie:  http://pastie.org/8034432
[12:17:44] <shoky> ryorky1: don't do $.parseJSON if you already have dataType: 'json'
[12:18:08] <surfdue> shoky: not sure what you mean by that
[12:18:17] <shoky> ryorky1: and don't use alerts for debugging
[12:18:23] <surfdue> shoky: if I go to the query url's manually it does work with a 200 status
[12:18:26] <surfdue> and returns json
[12:18:36] <ryorky1> shoky:  then how do I reference the data?
[12:18:44] <surfdue> oh...
[12:18:45] <shoky> ryorky1: data.parent
[12:18:58] <surfdue> shoky: i didnt think about cookies/session id
[12:19:37] <ryorky1> shoky:  ah, thank you very much
[12:19:57] <shoky> surfdue: i was just asking if that's the right url pattern for the 'remote', like if i type 'bla'  then it'll try to fetch bla.json
[12:20:08] <surfdue> yes it is correct
[12:21:18] <shoky> surfdue: what did you mean exactly with "its ignoring my url in remote and instead trying to retrieve the json results on the current page url"
[12:21:44] <surfdue> shoky: i dont think its a sessions issue either, basically when I type into the input box it shows the prefix results but then tries to load the page im on again in the console.
[12:22:07] <surfdue> it thinks the remote url is on the page im currently on for some reason, yet all of my console logs show the url is set correctly
[12:22:19] <shoky> no idea what you mean
[12:22:27] <shoky> "tried to load the page im on again in the console" ??
[12:22:50] <Blackbox> I need to make waveform images from uploaded mp3 what could be the best way ?
[12:23:00] <surfdue> shoky: http://pastebin.com/2xjmfxFV
[12:23:38] <surfdue> shoky: its trying to get the json results from the page I am currently on, the one the typeahead html form is on.
[12:24:18] <shoky> surfdue: i donno what that paste is showing..
[12:24:40] <surfdue> shoky: my debug console
[12:25:01] <shoky> surfdue: yeah but you didn't show any code writing to the console
[12:25:02] <surfdue> shoky: I went into the source typeahead.js and put console logs every time the url variable is passed around.
[12:25:13] <shoky> huh :\
[12:26:21] <surfdue> shoky: I am using typeahead.js, as you know, except that I put a debug line "console.log('DEBUG BLA: ' + url)" above and below each line in typeahead.js that manipulates or uses the url, remote.url or this.remote variables.
[12:27:01] <shoky> surfdue:  that says nothing to me as i haven't looked inside its code..  what's the symptom/problem you're experiencing?
[12:27:14] <surfdue> According to my console log, the URL that should be requested in my network log is the proper one "/admin/ajax/selector/form_department/on.json" however it is actually loading the current url "/admin/event/edit/1"
[12:27:54] <surfdue> shoky: the problem is that the script appears to be completely ignoring the remote url I configured or some how the $.ajax call is being "redirected" for some reason..
[12:27:59] <shoky> you type 'on'  and what happens?  not in your console. on the page, and in your devtools network tab
[12:31:05] <surfdue> shoky: the hint popup with my prefetch results and lots of extra "empty lines" because typeahead is loading the html of the current page as its result.
[12:31:34] <surfdue> shoky: the network tab shows the current url being loaded
[12:32:26] <goddard> can i bind a click event based on a rel value?
[12:32:29] <shoky> surfdue: got a live link maybe?
[12:33:03] <surfdue> shoky: unfortunately its all on my local. I thought perhaps a browser plugin on chrome was interfering but the same results occur in safari
[12:33:09] <shoky> surfdue: can't really say what's wrong, because your code is loading the right urls on that jsfiddle

[12:33:43] <jeremy-> as if I'm instantly adding it back again
[12:34:21] <shoky> goddard: meaning?
[12:35:20] <shoky> goddard: you can bind click events to any elements as long as you can select them somehow
[12:35:35] <surfdue> shoky: i found it, it was jquery validation
[12:36:01] <shoky> o
[12:37:06] <surfdue> shoky: I was on version 1.7, upgraded to 1.11.1 no issues. ugh
[12:37:10] <surfdue> shoky: thanks for your help
[12:37:21] <shoky> yw
[12:39:15] <goddard> shoky: thats what i mean i guess
[12:39:28] <goddard> shoky: i want to select them with their rel value

[12:43:23] <Krambiorix> hi, i have a problem : in firebug i see the response but when i alert it, i get nothing :  http://pastebin.com/cpRhWJJP
[12:43:46] <Saaether> your alert isnt waiting for the ajax to complete
[12:43:58] <goddard> shoky: oh ya duh thanks
[12:45:03] <Krambiorix> Saaether, what can i do about that?
[12:47:04] <Saaether> you cant do a return like that using an async call because the return happens before the value is set
[12:47:20] <lhunath> I want to do some setup only when body has a kiosk class; I tried replacing $(document).ready([setup]) by $('body.kiosk').ready([setup]) with no luck.  any advice?
[12:47:21] <Krambiorix> Saaether, it's not an async call
[12:47:33] <Saaether> oops didnt notice the async false
[12:48:04] <Krambiorix> Saaether, when i put the alert in the succes function, i get nothing too
[12:51:13] <Saaether> Krambiorix so when your debugging this, data is coming back with a value?
[12:52:04] <hazamonzo_> hey folks. How might i remove the active class from the previous button and add it to the  new button (that has just been clicked) http://paste.kde.org/770978/ I can already assign the active class to the clicked button but im not sure how to remove it from the previous active button. Cheeeers!
[12:52:07] <Krambiorix> Saaether, in firebug yes
[12:52:29] <Krambiorix> Saaether, but my alert IN the success function doesn't show up...
[12:53:09] <Saaether> ... is success even firing? might want to throw in a .error() and alert from that as well
[12:53:37] <Krambiorix> Saaether, i don't think it's firing
[12:54:04] <goddard> shoky: i got another one can i watch an element for a class change and trigger something based on that change?
[12:54:10] <goddard> is that bind?
[12:54:47] <Saaether> Krambiorix might want to get the error text then and find out whats happening =)
[12:55:02] <Krambiorix> Saaether, it's error
[12:55:15] <Krambiorix> Saaether, but the status is 200
[12:56:37] <relipse> any suggestions for a logged in menu bar at the top?
[12:56:46] <Krambiorix> Saaether, found it... My ajax req returned html (and not json) ...
[12:56:58] <Saaether> hazamonzo_ http://jsfiddle.net/Cs8mf/
[12:57:07] <Saaether> Krambiorix that would do it =)
[12:57:12] <Krambiorix> Saaether, thanks!
[12:57:44] <hazamonzo_> Saaether: Thank you!

[13:09:06] <relipse> anyone know of a good css menu bar?
[13:10:12] <duckx0r> I'm trying to learn the basics of jquery. I see some code that has $(':button') in it. What exactly does the colon do here?
[13:10:43] <Andrew_R> relispe: superfish menus will degrade to CSS only if JS isn't enabled.
[13:11:15] <thang> duckx0r: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:12:12] <duckx0r> thang, that's just what I needed. Thanks.
[13:12:55] <Andrew_R> duckx0r: the :button selector is a jquery extension, equivalent to "button, input[type=button]"
[13:13:01] <Andrew_R> see http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/
[13:13:10] <fllr> I have a list of items. I wanna make it so that whenever someone drags one of those items, and drops it into a drop area, it creates a list of objects in the drop area I can then sort. Does anyone know of a good plugin for jquery that does that?
[13:13:14] <drager> So I have made a preview function for my site; http://jsfiddle.net/zF2zz/ it works as expected but when the second "tab" is active I want to change the text "Write comment" to "Continue writing" or something like that. Ideas?
[13:13:43] <duckx0r> Andrew_R, heh funny, that's my brother's name.
[13:14:21] <duckx0r> Andrew_R, thanks for the link
[13:29:36] <duckx0r> ok another noobie question. If I have $(':button').click(function() { ... }, how do I get the element that was clicked in that function?
[13:29:55] <Talon_> this ?
[13:30:04] <fllr> , how do I get the element that was clicked in that function?
[13:30:07] <fllr> ops

[13:30:25] <fllr> duckx0r:
[13:34:02] <lamarus> Why would $(window).height() be giving me the height of the entire document and not just the window height?
[13:34:58] <lamarus> here is my js  http://paste.laravel.com/weP
[13:35:08] <c4ptnh00k> are you looking for the height of the display maybe?
[13:35:22] <lamarus> I want the height of the browser window
[13:35:38] <lamarus> but it is giving me the height of the whole document
[13:35:55] <duckx0r> thanks Talon_
[13:36:58] <thang> lamarus: try window.innerHeight
[13:38:14] <lamarus> thang:  that works… why does $(window).height() not
[13:40:55] <thang> lamarus: so theres two kinds of heights with respect to webpages, one is what you can see in the current window, and one is the height of the entire document
[13:41:26] <lamarus> thang… ya… I thought $(window).height did the current window….. and $(document).height did the entire document
[13:42:54] <drager> So I have made a preview function for my site; http://jsfiddle.net/zF2zz/ it works as expected but when the second "tab" is active I want to change the text "Write comment" to "Continue writing" or something like that. Ideas?
[13:45:13] <oste> how to detect if an element hit the bottom of the page on scroll?

[13:46:54] <affine> it works with position:relative
[13:46:57] <affine> hmm
[13:47:35] <drager> oste: Use the bottom element
[13:47:52] <oste> drager: what is that?
[13:47:59] <oste> i have not heard of the bottom element before
[13:48:38] <drager> oste: I meant the css; 'bottom'
[13:49:11] <oste> drager: not sure if that is going to help me detect when the element hits the bottom of the page
[13:49:44] <drager> oste: Wont it? If you know the height of the page
[13:49:49] <drager> Maybe im wrong
[13:50:11] <oste> yeah i think it is not a solution
[13:51:43] <drager> then use .height() ?
[13:51:48] <naeluh> Hey I am getting an error its - Uncaught ReferenceError: safari is not defined
[13:51:54] <naeluh> what is that ?
[13:52:14] <affine> how do you turn absolute coordinates into relative coordinates?
[13:52:21] <affine> seems like a rather simple task
[13:52:25] <affine> can't find a straight answer via search
[13:52:46] <affine> everyone assumes the troubleshooter just sucks at css and recommends position:absolute
[13:52:57] <affine> but I _need_ relative coords...
[13:55:39] <duckx0r> I'm trying to make a jquery image uploader. This is what I have http://paste.ubuntu.com/5756210/. It submits an ajax request, but $_POST is empty on the PHP side. What am I doing wrong?
[14:02:06] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: i think those exisit already, cant say for sure tho
[14:02:56] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, i got most of that code from a question on stackoverflow. it's just not sending any POST data to PHP
[14:04:01] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: if you're just copying the code, do you understand everything?
[14:05:16] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, not all of it. most of it is pretty self-explanatory though
[14:06:50] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: :/ if you're trying to learn the "basics of jquery" -- first you read up on enough js, then you read up on jquery -- i dont know why you would be doing this -- advising against it
[14:07:41] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, i already know JS. i'm just new to jquery
[14:08:06] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: so do step 2, then start breaking stuff
[14:08:27] <relipse> shoky: You there?
[14:08:27] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, looks like that's what I've done, isn't it?
[14:09:12] <relipse> Jquery-ui gurus: in a dialog box, is it possible to have a second mini-button next to the close button?
[14:09:19] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: you seem to have skipped step 2 and went right into breaking stuff
[14:10:09] <Talon_> is there a proper way to get back to the main instance inside of a $.each() loop? right now I set a var, main = this; then do my $.each(somethin,function() { and to access the main instance inside of the each loop I Just use my variable main, works perfectly, but looks kinda hackish.
[14:10:18] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, i don't have the time right now to become proficient in jquery. i just want to know why what I have isn't working at the moment. some day down the road, I will.
[14:10:51] <Lolita> Hi
[14:10:55] <duckx0r> hi Lolita
[14:11:18] <thang> duckx0r: not sure if you have a requirement to roll your own image uploader, but there are a few good ones out there: http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/basic.html
[14:12:13] <Lolita> when I do $(".myClass") I have an array of html elements, but in what order is it ? In order of apparition ?
[14:12:31] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: lol you're serious dont have time to learn? well im sure someone will help with every single question out there
[14:12:32] <affine> grr
[14:13:15] <^Simon^> if I do xhr = $.ajax() and then before it's finished xhr.abort(), is there a callback that is triggered other than success? At the moment it seems to be calling success but data is null (or is that what I have to test for?)
[14:13:19] <affine> is there a way to not have the draggables spawn next to each other when I add them to a div?
[14:13:37] <^Simon^> Lolita - as far as I know, yes.. the order they appear in the document.
[14:13:59] <duckx0r> thang, the demo in that link doesn't appear to work
[14:14:30] <duckx0r> thang, at least the basic one
[14:17:03] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, you're mis-interpreting what i said. i said I don't have time to become proficient. not that I don't have time to learn.
[14:18:10] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: if you arent proficient enough, then fine w/e, then you're jsut gonna keep asking ppl questions, and "someone" will probably and eventually help yoiu
[14:18:25] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: i was just saying what you should be doing, but you dont have the time
[14:19:11] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, ideally, i agree. that's what i should be doing.
[14:19:38] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, i just assumed i was *almost there* with the code I had
[14:20:09] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, maybe I was.
[14:20:13] <thang> duckx0r: ive personally used it on live sites, i also meant to link you the basic ui version (but like you said, the upload server is down)
[14:20:55] <duckx0r> thang, yeah I just noticed that. I guess that's why the basic demo doesn't work. I'm looking into installing that right now. thanks for the link.
[14:24:24] <motaka2> how can I stop attaching an event multiple times to the same element ?
[14:25:39] <relipse> I added a button to the ui dialog next to the "x" close button, but it looks offset and how do i make it act like a button on hover -- go to http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/?theme=humanity login as test_test_test admin testtest
[14:26:04] <relipse> shoky: you here?
[14:27:33] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: "ihelpsu, i just assumed i was *almost there* with the code I had" -- i dont know if you really can be because you said you were new -- if this was a time-thing i guss it's fine
[14:29:58] <thang> ...
[14:30:27] <motaka2> why no one does not answer me?
[14:30:28] <duckx0r> ihelpsu, of course you can be close to having a working script even if you're new to a particular language. if the basic functionality is what I want, then that's good enough for me
[14:30:51] <thang> motaka2: if youre attaching an event multiple times in the same element you should keep track of state to prevent that, but a workaround could be this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2008592/can-i-find-events-bound-on-an-element-with-jquery
[14:31:16] <ihelpsu> duckx0r: did at the start that this probably already exist, just wasnt sure
[14:33:18] <motaka2> thang: the problem is I add click event to all my ajax loaded <a>s and when I return back to a page containing alteady shown <a> and click it and it triggers two times
[14:33:38] <ihelpsu>  duckx0r: did say*
[14:34:08] <Toerkeium> hello guys, I'm trying to use the Google Places api with $.getJSON, and I was getting an empty response. So I searched and it looks like it's a cross-domain issue, where jsonp shoult take place but seems like the google places api doesn't support jsonp. so, is there any way I can  use the google places api with jquery?
[14:34:23] <Toerkeium> I use the google maps api without trouble with $.getJSON
[14:35:24] <rue> If you need JSONP (i.e. must support <IE8, which has XDomainRequest) and the service doesn’t, you need a proxy
[14:36:19] <motaka2> how can I stop reattaching events to already ajax loaded contents ?
[14:37:11] <Toerkeium> rue: never used a proxy. Can you give me an example?
[14:38:26] <rue> Toerkeium: The request needs to go through a server. You can search for 'jsonp proxy' or maybe 'cors proxy' if you like. But need that server…
[14:40:42] <Toerkeium> rue: do you know why it's different than google map api, why they could make it this way?
[14:40:55] <rue> Nope
[14:41:04] <motaka2> Cork: how can I stop reattaching events to already ajax loaded contents ?
[14:41:33] <affine> anyone know a fix to this draggable bug? http://jsfiddle.net/qBubN/7/
[14:41:45] <Toerkeium> rue: when you say "the request needs to go through a server", what do you mean?
[14:42:31] <Toerkeium> won't be cross domain troubles anyway?
[14:43:59] <saba> Can anyone confirm that a checkbox's state is changed before the click event is triggered? I haven't yet found this in the docs.
[14:44:22] <saba> Testing it confirms this, however testing is not always the best.
[14:47:06] <shoky> relipse: sort of
[14:47:40] <BillCriswell> saba: Hmmm... I'd think it happens after the click. I'm not sure though.
[14:49:42] <BillCriswell> saba: Ah, my tests suggest the change happens first.
[14:52:31] <Draxelis> can I select element like this $(".topnav li a").click... ?
[14:52:44] <BillCriswell> Draxelis: Yup.
[14:52:46] <Draxelis> I want some action to happen when one clicks on a
[14:53:01] <Draxelis> hm, doesnt work for some reason
[14:54:15] <BillCriswell> Draxelis: Does your html look like <ul class="topnav"><li><a/></li></ul> ?
[14:54:27] <BillCriswell> Are you running the script when the document is ready for it?
[14:54:40] <Draxelis> BillCriswell,  li and a have some classes
[14:54:53] <saba> BillCriswell: that seems to be the case. However, stuff like this confuses me http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3827
[14:55:07] <Draxelis> but I want it to target all li's and a's. And yes, BillCriswell  it's document ready
[14:55:13] <saba> I realise that it is relevant that I'm still on 1.8
[14:55:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ipimir/1/edit is what i tested
[14:56:36] <BillCriswell> Draxelis: It should totally work.
[14:57:01] <Draxelis> hm smth wrong. trying to figure out what
[14:58:49] <Draxelis> setting up jsfiddle:)
[14:59:15] <shoky> relipse: for the offset.. give it the same css as the close button has (e.g. position:absolute; top:50%; padding:1px; margin: -10px 0 0 0; etc..) just change the 'right' appropriately  e.g. right: 2.3em
[15:00:14] <BillCriswell> Good night!
[15:00:38] <shoky> night BillCris_
[15:00:41] <shoky> hm
[15:01:01] <shoky> relipse: btw you're including more than one jqui css
[15:01:12] <Draxelis> http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/3/ why doesnt this work when I click on links?
[15:02:11] <Draxelis> where's the problem ;/
[15:02:25] <shoky> Draxelis: check your javascript console
[15:03:33] <relipse> shoky: how do i get the hover outline and stuff?
[15:04:07] <Draxelis> dammit
[15:04:10] <Draxelis> shoky thanks
[15:04:20] <Draxelis> simple stuff like that
[15:04:22] <Draxelis> overlooked
[15:04:23] <Draxelis> ;/
[15:06:22] <shoky> relipse: with css :hover  or js
[15:08:21] <ihelpsu> relipse: you're suppose to read up on basics as alreayd said in teh other chans
[15:09:10] <relipse> looks like you have to use js
[15:11:04] <shoky> relipse: why?
[15:11:15] <relipse> because it uses ui-state-hover
[15:11:25] <relipse> which adds the necessary themed infor
[15:11:26] <relipse> info~
[15:11:41] <shoky> oh if you wanna use their classes, ya
[15:11:42] <relipse> can i add a class on hover?
[15:12:02] <shoky> dont think so
[15:12:13] <PhonicUK> Say I have a bunch of spans with an ID all in a row, each span containing some text - when some of the text is highlighted with the cursor, how can I tell which spans have been selected?
[15:15:45] <Pingu> Hey guys
[15:15:49] <Pingu> what's up
[15:18:35] <Draxelis> jquery <3
[15:31:07] <GaryOak_> what's going on?
[15:33:53] <ihelpsu> this is what's goig on -- http://bricss.net/
[15:35:40] <GaryOak_> whoa
[15:37:32] <Draxelis> can i do smth like   click -> addClass("navbutton:after") ?
[15:39:37] <shoky> PhonicUK: here's a first attempt.. http://jsfiddle.net/fdBkv/
[15:40:17] <PhonicUK> shoky, very nice!
[15:40:32] <PhonicUK> shoky, seems to work - I made a post on stackoverflow, if you want to answer it i'll mark it
[15:40:42] <PhonicUK> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17054790/checking-which-elements-contain-text-that-has-been-highlighted?noredirect=1#comment24660191_17054790
[15:41:14] <shoky> i suppose i will ;p
[15:44:15] <shoky> PhonicUK: done
[15:44:24] <PhonicUK> tyvm
[15:44:44] <PhonicUK> im having a crack at writing a rich text editor :)
[15:45:38] <shoky> i remember you were working on some alpine framework thingy
[15:50:30] <Draxelis> I want to addClass("topnav:after"); but it doesnt work
[15:51:02] <shoky> Draxelis: that's not a class..
[15:51:03] <Draxelis> topnav:after adds some icon which indicated that element is active
[15:51:59] <shoky> if you want to add something after something else with jquery.. use .after() or insertAfter()
[15:52:47] <Draxelis> ok
[15:53:52] <GaryOak_> PhonicUK: how is that going?
[16:01:45] <pontiusco> hello, how what could be a possible reason why google adsense does not render/work with jquerymobile?
[16:15:36] <Draxelis> I created triangle with css which I want to add to certain elements when they are clicked (when they are active). I can add this triangle with :after or :before. How can i add this thing to elements on click? If I use .insertAfter, then i'll have to create div with this triangle and then using jquery move this thing to active elements? is this the only way?
[16:17:26] <Draxelis> I wanted something like  class="button"  in normal state -> class="button active:after"  in active state with this triangle but this doesnt work
[16:29:06] <Draxelis> $(".active-btn").insertAfter($("li").parent(".topnav"));   does this make sense?
[16:46:04] <nutron> This is simple javascript, but I think I'm trying to be too "cool"  translating what I know in perl and other languages.  In essence I want to return the second element returned by a method to a single variable.  Here's context.  (haven't tried it because it looks horribly wrong).... masterNode=(node.tree.getNodeByKey(node.data.key),getLevel())[1]; ...  ridiculous huh?  All I'm saving is one line, but it seems silly to assign it to avariable, and on t
[16:46:04] <nutron> he next line assign element 1 to another variable...
[16:46:17] <nutron> ugh...
[16:48:17] <Draxelis> it's pretty silent here
[16:48:19] <Draxelis> :)
[16:49:35] <ansipants> very
[16:50:03] <nutron> heh
[16:57:58] <FernandoBasso> How to return values from things like jQuery('.my-class input').click(function() { var imgName = someValue }); ?
[16:59:29] <nutron> Ok, tried it... it works =)
[17:19:16] <Talon_> in a sortable update event, how do I get the actual element that moved? ui.item says its the object representing the current dragged element...
[17:25:17] <wroathe> When you create an element with $('<element>') jquery creates a document fragment correct? Does anyone know any good documentation on what sorts of things you can do with elements inside of a document fragment? For example, can you bind and detach events from elements inside of fragments?
[17:25:38] <wroathe> In this instance I've got a canvas element I'm creating and prepending to another element
[17:25:56] <wroathe> Would getting that canvases context while it's just a fragment break anything down the road?
[17:33:46] <jmmy> cms website are slow to load aren't they?
[17:34:35] <jedimind> compared to what ?
[17:34:46] <jmmy> non-cms
[17:34:51] <jedimind> also what does that have to do with jquery?
[17:35:03] <jmmy> not much
[17:35:07] <jmmy> nothing
[17:35:27] <jedimind> ok well, yes, technically they do require more resources on the server than a static site
[17:35:47] <jedimind> but also cms based sites can run very fast and serve up to millions of poeple
[17:35:54] <jedimind> given the right architecture, power, etc
[17:36:07] <jedimind> effectively every site you visit on a daily basis is CMS driven more or lress
[17:36:17] <jedimind> "lress" im making shit up
[17:36:18] <jmmy> I just noticed a couple wordpress sites and they are slow to load
[17:36:31] <jedimind> yeah, but engadget.com is also a "wordpress site"
[17:36:37] <jedimind> so its all about how you set it up
[17:36:47] <jedimind> some wordpress sites are ferrarris, some are fiats
[17:36:50] <jedimind> ferrrrrrrrr
[17:37:17] <jmmy> well, I guess the big professional companies can hire competent programmers but small firms, that just use stock everything and the plugins, they end up with slow loading sites
[17:40:20] <systemfault> Big companies are not that much better… seriously.
[17:40:54] <whatadewitt> ahoy! i'm having a heckuva time getting .mousemove to trigger for me... currently i'm just trying to log a message to the console when mousemove goes, but i'm never seeing anything
[17:40:56] <wroathe> If anything, big companies are worse.
[17:41:09] <wroathe> One word: recruiters.
[17:41:18] <wroathe> Gross
[17:41:27] <jedimind> jmmy:  www.styledui.com does that load slow ?
[17:41:47] <whatadewitt> though looking at it... it may only be in chrome that i'm not seeing it...
[17:42:10] <wroathe> whatadewitt: Show us some code
[17:42:14] <jmmy> jedimind, yeah kinda, not as bad as canadianprocessserving.com or devdec.ca
[17:42:49] <whatadewitt> wroathe: i'll gist it in a sec, i'm just realizing it's only chrome, so it may be an issue i can figure out myself, but i will post the code if i cant figure it out! thanks!
[17:42:59] <systemfault> jedimind: Great wp site, it's yours?
[17:43:36] <systemfault> jedimind: I'll never understand why wp seem to hate caching that much.
[17:44:09] <jedimind> yeah systemfault  thats mine
[17:44:20] <jedimind> jmmy: its not overly slow, but thats basically stock wordpress
[17:44:26] <jedimind> i havent done anything to it, and its on a shared host
[17:45:05] <jmmy> jedimind, it was decent, just under 1sec.  But the two I mentioned were bad, at least 1sec delay.
[17:45:23] <jedimind> that could be any number of things, starting with their hosting
[17:45:46] <jmmy> jedimind, wouldn't I notice that same delay when I ping them then?
[17:46:08] <jmmy> jedimind, did you visit those link and duplicate my results?
[17:46:09] <jedimind> not necessarily, it could be just that they're on a hosted single server that's serving up 300 other clients in terms of processing php/mysql/etc
[17:46:21] <jedimind> that's not necessarily related to the connection that the server is on hence the ping
[17:46:23] <jmmy> jedimind, yeah true
[17:46:26] <jedimind> yeah, they're somewhat sluggish to load
[17:48:09] <jmmy> jedimind, you highly doubt wordpress could be the culprit
[17:48:37] <jedimind> jmmy: no, im not saying that, im just saying that it could be any number of things, but i doubt that wordpress itself is the primary contributor
[17:48:43] <jedimind> wordpress with 50 plugins could be
[17:48:51] <whatadewitt> wroathe: here is the code - http://pastebin.com/9xeYcRX2 -- just isn't firing at all in chrome, working fine in FF
[17:48:55] <jmmy> jedimind, what other things/
[17:49:23] <jedimind> jmmy: badly written custom plugins, data they're pulling from 3rd party APIs (maps etc) taht need to respond, their hosting provider, unoptimized code
[17:49:38] <jedimind> any number of things, but dont think that wordpress by itself is the culprit
[17:49:45] <jmmy> jedimind, thx
[17:49:51] <jedimind> np
[17:50:34] <jmmy> jedimind, what else do you know from inspection about the map programming?
[17:54:40] <Draxelis> Could someone help to do some stuff with jquery on jsfiddle?
[17:55:04] <jmmy> wierd question...totally inappropriate
[17:55:34] <jmmy> how do you spell ediquette?
[17:55:36] <Draxelis> jmmy,  when i ask normal question noone says anything
[17:55:53] <Draxelis> so I'm asking if anyone has a min to help
[17:55:56] <jmmy> Draxelis, you gonna trick em into it eh? You clever one.
[17:56:24] <Draxelis> ye jmmy   *evil laugh*
[17:56:36] <jmmy> IF someone knew the answer I'm sure they tell you.  If no one said anything, cause you didn't ask good question, or they don't know.
[17:57:41] <Draxelis> ok
[17:57:52] <Draxelis> i'm setting up jsfiddle
[17:58:03] <jmmy> now we're talking
[17:58:04] <Draxelis> preparing the stage for the show
[17:58:04] <jedimind> jmmy: i didnt inspect it
[17:58:20] <jedimind> jmmy: the map that is
[17:58:32] <jmmy> jedimind, dont worry about it.  They didn't hire me yet
[17:58:33] <jedimind> i could do a full audit for you, but i charge $125/hr :)
[17:58:46] <jmmy> They insisting on wordpress or some cms, but I don't wanna learn one
[17:59:05] <jedimind> in the meantime, maybe you can use https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/
[17:59:06] <jmmy> jedimind, send me an email so I have your contact and skillset
[17:59:25] <jedimind> www.pud.ca is me, all my info's there including my cv
[17:59:35] <jmmy> jedimind, lots of idiots setup sites but they don't know what they are doing and they wanna hire someone for just 1-2hours to fix their crap
[17:59:43] <jmmy> jedimind, thx, I am itsource.pw
[18:00:12] <jmmy> jedimind, frig man...looks nice, you make a great instant impression
[18:00:23] <jedimind> i dont do "1-2hours to fix crap" type of work for the record :)
[18:00:31] <jedimind> but thanks :)
[18:00:40] <jmmy> jedimind, That is totally fair to me.  I don't either.
[18:00:47] <jedimind> im assuming you're talking about my resume
[18:00:57] <jmmy> no just the page itself
[18:01:19] <jmmy> You have an eye for design.  I am totally lacking that skill.  I use templates.
[18:01:45] <jmmy> You can tell a beautiful design from crap instantly.  I can't create beauty
[18:02:07] <jmmy> Hey man...we neighbors eh
[18:02:19] <jedimind> yeah kinda, you're a hamilton guy :)
[18:02:27] <jedimind> im supposed to dislike you by default or something
[18:02:27] <jmmy> Ryerson
[18:03:00] <jmmy> I consider Hamilton to be Toronto just the same.  Matter fact I can't tell difference between Toronto, Hamilton, California....
[18:03:22] <jmmy> Your resume looks great
[18:03:23] <jedimind> we wont get into the philosophical implications of that statement :)
[18:03:31] <jedimind> primarily because im about to have some food, its 9pm i havent eaten since lunch
[18:03:35] <jedimind> and just did a 25k bike ride

[18:05:21] <jmmy> doesn't it already?

[18:05:59] <jmmy> do you know how to make just the individual link to drop down?
[18:06:15] <Draxelis> you see how it looks in the beginning? I want the sub list one line at a time under specific link
[18:06:24] <jmmy> If you have multiple list items with same class name, how do you select just the class name that is clicked?
[18:07:05] <Draxelis> i was thinking about smth like "this"  .closest li

[18:08:18] <jmmy> there must be a way.  what you said sounds good to me
[18:09:24] <Draxelis> naming each li or a differently is not efficient i presume
[18:09:45] <jmmy> Draxelis, you have a css issue basically, you want those two red item that show up side by side to show up on top of each other?
[18:10:00] <jedimind> Draxelis: its hard
[18:10:11] <jmmy> Draxelis, yeah, inefficient, plus should be easy enough to do the way you have it
[18:10:17] <jedimind> its hard to break out of the LI structure to throw in the ULs in between like that
[18:10:25] <jedimind> i had to use javascript to break up the giant UL into line by line
[18:10:44] <jedimind> http://www.pud.ca/beta-v7a/
[18:10:46] <Draxelis> so, I should has specific classes?
[18:10:49] <jedimind> when i did that like 2-3 years ago
[18:10:49] <fender0107401> it is necessary to load jQuery before any code to use it? I mean the loading order is important or not?
[18:11:06] <jedimind> same principle
[18:11:56] <systemfault> fender0107401: Of course… if you use the $ and it doesn't exists yet… guess what will happen.
[18:12:42] <jmmy> jedimind, you worked for Microsoft - BIEB?
[18:12:56] <jedimind> yeah, i did a bunch of microsoft work a few years ago
[18:13:01] <Draxelis> so what's the best way to make those sub li to appear one by one under the link?
[18:13:05] <fender0107401> I think the browser will parse everything when it loaded everything.
[18:13:08] <jmmy> fender0107401, that is jquery 101
[18:13:10] <jedimind> that thing is like 3 years old now, i never went live with it because i was too lazy to do the content :)
[18:13:14] <loopsdeer> Any Deferred/Promises people here? I'm trying to animate an image one direction while I hold down a button, and another direction when I let go of the button. Does this sound like a good place to use Deferreds/Promises?
[18:13:34] <fender0107401> Hi jmmy.
[18:13:37] <jedimind> i still have my cardreader / swipe card for MS access to their repositories somewhere
[18:13:58] <jmmy> fender0107401, hi
[18:15:27] <Draxelis> i still don't get it. do you recommend to use different class names for each category or what?
[18:15:36] <systemfault> loopsdeer: Not really imho, I'd probably use events.
[18:15:54] <fender0107401> By 101, you mean that is simplest rule, right?
[18:16:08] <loopsdeer> systemfault: Like custom events? obviously the key stuff will be events :-p
[18:16:28] <fender0107401> I am a newcomer, haha, just start js and jquery.
[18:16:46] <systemfault> loopsdeer: That's what I would do.
[18:17:19] <loopsdeer> systemfault: I think that makes sense. I just learned about Promises/Deferreds and kinda looking for cool places to use them :-D
[18:17:31] <loopsdeer> systemfault: Thanks, attempting it now. I'll report back here
[18:19:36] <jmmy> Draxelis, http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/7/
[18:20:15] <systemfault> loopsdeer: I love deferreds :P Take a look at q.js if you want to see a more powerful implementation.
[18:21:14] <Draxelis> jmmy,  you reorganised sub li's so that they go in twos, right?
[18:21:21] <Draxelis> this is what i did :D
[18:21:25] <Draxelis> too
[18:21:33] <jmmy> Draxelis, I think so, I just put float: left; clear: left;
[18:21:43] <jmmy> Draxelis, that's what you wanted?
[18:22:05] <Draxelis> that solves abit of a problem
[18:22:08] <jmmy> display: block
[18:22:20] <jmmy> it still doesn't line up nice though eh
[18:22:27] <loopsdeer> systemfault: Awesome, thanks, checking it out now
[18:22:51] <systemfault> loopsdeer: I use it in all my node projects, can't live without it now :P
[18:22:57] <Draxelis> jmmy,  doesnt matter the css. In actual html it's different - looks all good. but I struggle with functionality. let me explain
[18:23:09] <melvinram> Anyone know of a good plugin for achieving the following effect? http://www.scriptocean.com/accordion.html
[18:23:56] <jmmy> melvinram, I've seen a few those in jquery plugins section last time I checked
[18:23:56] <loopsdeer> systemfault: Aye, my work is all front-end, so still trying to get my head around when they will be useful for UI events. Ajax is the simplest solution to see.
[18:25:20] <Draxelis> jmmy,  when one clicks say on first "tralala"  I want only 1 sub-li to appear under it, and in this case it's "lalala -1 and lalala 0". If click on second "tralala" the "lalala-1 & lalala 0" should disappear and instead of it appear appropriate list which is "lalala 1 and lalala2". Do you know what i mean?
[18:25:23] <systemfault> loopsdeer: On the client side, all ajax related functions return promises, you can also use promises with jQuery animations
[18:25:43] <jmmy> Draxelis, yeah, thats what I mentioned earlier
[18:25:45] <systemfault> loopsdeer: For example, $.when makes it very easy to do something when X animations are done
[18:26:01] <melvinram> jmmy: hmm I'm seeing just 3. Two of those doesn't do what I need. Third one is taking a while to load.
[18:26:17] <melvinram> jmmy: I had searched for "horizontal accordion"
[18:26:24] <melvinram> maybe I should be searching something else?
[18:26:51] <jmmy> There are more if you google, but those ones on the site should be good ones
[18:27:02] <jmmy> Draxelis, so you should use this I think
[18:27:23] <Draxelis> use what?
[18:27:24] <jmmy> $(this).child-that-is-class-row
[18:27:40] <Draxelis> hm
[18:27:41] <Draxelis> ok
[18:28:01] <jmmy> jquery has major selection capabilites, this should be easy to do
[18:30:00] <Draxelis> hm
[18:30:02] <Draxelis> trying now
[18:30:11] <jmmy> Draxelis, $(this).sibling is probably it
[18:30:29] <wroathe> Why doesn't this work?: $(window).on('load', function () { console.log('Hello, World!'); });
[18:30:36] <Draxelis> I have a bad feeling about this ;)
[18:30:40] <jmmy> you gotta display it basically cause its set to display:none; so you just gotta do .show()
[18:30:47] <wroathe> $(window).load works, but you would think .on would be the same thing
[18:31:20] <jmmy> Draxelis, .next()
[18:31:42] <jmmy> $(this).next().show(); should do it
[18:31:59] <jmmy> how do you spell aught to do it? *aught
[18:32:00] <Draxelis> so where sibling?
[18:32:03] <wroathe> Oh, wait, nvm.
[18:32:22] <jmmy> Draxelis, I think .next() is what you need.  I will select the very next sibling
[18:32:35] <Draxelis> up or down DOM?
[18:32:41] <Draxelis> how does it work
[18:32:49] <Draxelis> closest goes up
[18:32:52] <Draxelis> and next?
[18:33:00] <tw2113> what was the issue wroathe
[18:33:00] <loopsdeer> systemfault: Thanks ;) those are actually the two uses I've gotten a hold of. I'm more wondering about user input events like mouse/key stuff. Maybe there's not a ton of use-cases there though
[18:33:03] <jmmy> Draxelis, didn't work, gives error
[18:33:33] <Talon_> jQuery Ui question: using sortable() with an update function, (update states by docs that it's triggered when sorting stopped and dom position has changed) how do I reference the element that moved? ui.item is not the original element, it's a clone.
[18:33:43] <raj> why do I not get a jquery object when I do $('#whatever') ?
[18:33:47] <raj> I just get the plain html element
[18:34:10] <loopsdeer> systemfault: I saw a good one regarding form completion, like $.when(each, input, isFilled), but it didn't handle the case where any input became unfilled later.
[18:34:10] <raj> and I can't even wrap it with an extra $() to make it a jquery element
[18:34:21] <raj> ..in Chrome
[18:34:22] <tw2113> fiddle raj ?
[18:34:39] <systemfault> raj: jQuery is not loaded probably.
[18:34:48] <raj> i'm loading it in tampermonkey
[18:35:10] <jmmy> Draxelis, I have no idea why $(this).next().show() doesn't work.  Any see anything wrong with it? http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/9/
[18:35:49] <systemfault> raj: It's probably what I say… jQuery is not loaded so chrome uses its internal $
[18:36:26] <raj> oh, interesting
[18:36:31] <raj> how can I load jquery?
[18:36:40] <raj> in console
[18:36:47] <jmmy> Chrome doesn't do that does it?
[18:36:57] <tw2113> i'd first try substituting jQuery for $ raj
[18:37:04] <tw2113> just in case
[18:37:08] <CocoStorm> hey guys, I've created a div and used jquery to have an onclick function.  But when you hover over it, the cursor is just a text curser and not the hand thing which indicates it's clickable.  What should I do? do I have to add an <a href> element that doesn't link to anywhere?
[18:37:22] <raj> tw2113, systemfault is right
[18:37:23] <Draxelis> all hell broke loose
[18:37:23] <raj> I just tested
[18:37:33] <systemfault> jmmy: It's a new feature
[18:37:48] <jmmy> systemfault, thx
[18:38:07] <jmmy> Draxelis, frig man... I think I need to put this in quotes
[18:38:14] <tw2113> sounds like a good plan CocoStorm
[18:38:36] <Draxelis> jmmy,  what quotes?
[18:38:39] <CocoStorm> tw2113, is there a better way?
[18:38:55] <tw2113> better is subjective
[18:38:57] <jmmy> Draxelis, nevermind, it didn't work, should have tried before mentioning it
[18:39:03] <tw2113> i see nothing wrong with a # href
[18:39:18] <jmmy> Draxelis, For some reason $(this).next().show() doesn't work
[18:39:20] <tw2113> just add some preventDefault() action to the event
[18:39:30] <jmmy> I'll try fadeToggle then
[18:39:31] <Draxelis> jmmy, it doesnt seem right.
[18:39:50] <Draxelis> jmmy,  are you sure it selects .row?
[18:39:50] <CocoStorm> tw2113, preventdefault() ?
[18:40:15] <tw2113> so that you don't try to go to the href
[18:40:24] <jmmy> Draxelis, check the docs.  Maybe I don't know how to chain em.  but $(this).next() should select the row we want as I understand it
[18:40:26] <tw2113> which would just take you to the top of the page
[18:42:16] <CocoStorm> tw2113, I've added a <a href=""> and my onclick function doesn't work anymore
[18:42:43] <tw2113> CocoStorm, fiddle what you have
[18:42:53] <jmmy> CocoStorm, you mean .click()
[18:43:02] <Draxelis> jmmy,  it's <li><a> </a></li>  and then li.row  so <a> is not directly next to li.row, or is it?
[18:43:18] <jmmy> Draxelis, oh, I read it wrong then, let me see
[18:43:45] <tw2113> jmmy, a lot of ancient tutorials on js exist still and use onClick attributes with links
[18:44:32] <jmmy> tw2113, oh well, you can skip that part and use .click().  Or just use onclick() it works fine too I guess, just isn't up to date with modern practices
[18:45:06] <jmmy> Draxelis, you must have them embed like that, why not get rid of the extra <ul>. You need it for some other reason?
[18:45:08] <Draxelis> can't do something like "this.parent"?
[18:45:38] <MILLIONAIRE> is github down?
[18:46:06] <tw2113> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/github.com
[18:46:09] <jmmy> Draxelis, no, obviously, we must continue after next().  We start with our class=topnavd1 with this, then we move the the immediately following li item with next, now we need the first child element that is a li item
[18:46:30] <Draxelis> ok
[18:46:41] <MILLIONAIRE> is github offline?
[18:46:52] <tw2113> MILLIONAIRE, http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/github.com
[18:47:00] <Draxelis> jmmy,  sounds complicated
[18:47:03] <jmmy> how do you say first child element that is li element?
[18:47:12] <MILLIONAIRE> wtf
[18:47:19] <MILLIONAIRE> does github go down often?
[18:47:25] <tw2113> not really
[18:47:29] <tw2113> but no one has perfect uptime
[18:47:35] <tw2113> it happens
[18:47:57] <tw2113> just check hacker news it'll likely say it is soon
[18:48:38] <relipse> I have a <span>Title</span> , is it wise to have <span><img>Title</span> or should i use css to background: position the logo inside the span?
[18:48:47] <jmmy> Draxelis, I tried this but failed: $(this).next().children("li").show();
[18:48:54] <tw2113> css whenever possible relipse
[18:49:04] <Draxelis> damn
[18:49:10] <Draxelis> ;/
[18:49:13] <relipse> do you know how to use css to do it?
[18:49:34] <tw2113> the background property
[18:49:38] <tw2113> bit of padding on the left
[18:49:42] <tw2113> display: block
[18:50:28] <relipse> how do i make the image resized smaller
[18:50:34] <relipse> is it possible?
[18:51:21] <Draxelis> jmmy,  we need to select first parent and then sibling
[18:51:25] <relipse> without using an image program to do it?
[18:51:52] <tw2113> why not provide a pre-resized image relipse
[18:51:57] <jmmy> Draxelis, um, I think $(this) selects the parent. give it an id and then try alert(this) and you will see what it is
[18:52:18] <relipse> tw2113: i have an image that already gets loaded in a big size, should be no problem to resize with css
[18:52:20] <relipse> if possible
[18:52:43] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/376253/stretch-and-scale-css-background
[18:53:47] <relipse> thanks
[18:53:54] <Draxelis> jmmy,  can jquery select two times like you did here $(this).next().children("li").show();?
[18:54:05] <Draxelis> not specifically this but in general
[18:54:16] <Apane> Jquery is awesome -- Is CoffeeScript basically a simplified version?
[18:54:18] <jmmy> chaining, yes, thats is what is great about jquery
[18:54:32] <Draxelis> ok trying now
[18:54:48] <ihelpsu> Apane yes
[18:55:04] <Apane> ihelpsu cool
[18:55:06] <systemfault> Apane: Coffeescript is a language the compiles to JavaScript… it's different.
[18:55:14] <relipse> what doess    background-attachment:fixed; do?
[18:56:22] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-attachment
[18:56:23] <Draxelis> jmmy,  it's alive !!!! $(this).parent().next().show();
[18:57:02] <jmmy> Draxelis, you were right.  This refers to the <a> so we had to go up one to the parent <li>
[18:57:12] <ihelpsu> Apane ur in the coffeescript chan.. why dont u ask there or google... sry i have this bad habit of intentionally giving false answers
[18:57:15] <jmmy> Draxelis, sweet, well done.
[18:57:22] <Draxelis> superb
[18:57:36] <Apane> ihelpsu: Just did
[18:57:48] <Draxelis> jmmy,  how  to make old sub-li disappear once new appears?
[18:57:50] <jmmy> Draxelis, paste the update please
[18:58:12] <Draxelis> http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/10/
[18:58:49] <Draxelis> hm
[18:59:10] <jmmy> Draxelis, give em a class name and then close em all first
[18:59:32] <jmmy> fadeToggle call back function
[19:00:29] <jmmy> I'm not sure if calling hide on of em is efficient.  There might be an better way.
[19:00:55] <Draxelis> dont know
[19:01:26] <jmmy> See here at http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/10/ When you show the <ul>, if you show fadeToggle() another element, how do you make it so the previous shown one hides itself
[19:01:45] <Draxelis> not sure how to implement this disappearance
[19:02:42] <jmmy> Draxelis, fadeToggle will hide it too.   But how to call it when another item is clicked is our problem eh.
[19:03:09] <Draxelis> ye
[19:03:21] <Draxelis>  $(this).parent().next().fadeToggle(); looks pretty nice
[19:03:41] <Draxelis> but need to hide already visible sub-li when new one is triggered
[19:04:54] <jmmy> you can always give em a class name and call hide() on all of em before running $(this).par...
[19:05:34] <jmmy> But I think there is probably a more sophisticated was that only calls hide on the open one.  Or maybe there isn't much overhead to calling hide() on all of em
[19:06:11] <jmmy> http://jsfiddle.net/N5TPe/11/
[19:06:55] <Draxelis> oh cool
[19:06:56] <Draxelis> :D
[19:06:57] <Draxelis> works
[19:06:59] <Draxelis> !!!!
[19:07:18] <Draxelis> so basically it hides all .rows on click, right?
[19:07:23] <CocoStorm> hey guys so I've done a tab thing without realising that Jquery UI already has it... but anyway I'll stick to this one but the problem is, it's super laggy! why? how can I fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/cUqh7/
[19:08:13] <jmmy> Draxelis, yeah, so first time everything is already hidden, and you hide em all again, which does nothing
[19:08:41] <Draxelis> jmmy,  is this hide() efficient, that is, if i use it alot, wont i have some problems?
[19:08:42] <Draxelis> :)
[19:09:40] <jmmy> Draxelis, not sure.  There is probably a more sophisticated way as I mentioned.  But I don't think you'll notice much overhead this way.  Maybe the sophisticated way would be more overhead cause its gotta do all them calculations.  Dunno, just doing conjecture
[19:10:08] <Draxelis> ok. :)
[19:10:23] <Draxelis> jmmy,  i'm super happy
[19:10:28] <Draxelis> you helped alot
[19:10:30] <Draxelis> thanks
[19:10:30] <Draxelis> :D
[19:10:37] <jmmy> Draxelis, np, good luck
[19:11:00] <Draxelis> ye, working on it now ;)
[19:12:57] <aftab> Hello, anyone here to help with jquery ajax upload please? I am having problems uploading multiple images
[19:14:13] <relipse> hey shoky: you here?
[19:14:14] <jmmy> aftab, you probably need a plugin to be able to upload multiple items.
[19:14:42] <jmmy> aftab, or maybe you are using new html5 features that allow multiple, dunno about it.  But I've seen plugins around for this at the jquery site
[19:15:14] <relipse> shoky: can you login to http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/ test_test_test admin testtest and help me set default button to cancel instead of "OK" when a user clicks "edit" bug and then the delete icon next to the X close icon?
[19:19:53] <aftab> jmmy: Thank you. I guess I will have to create multiple forms for each image and add them dynamically by using clone
[19:25:48] <lenswipee> hey, sometimes my dialog box behaves weird. It sometimes opens fine, but other times it will not respond to clicks; Even if I refresh the page. I have to reopen the browser for it to work again. Anyone come across this problem?
[19:32:13] <lenswipee> hi, what is the recommended way of preventing default action? returning false or e.preventDefault()?
[19:32:29] <relipse> how do i take focus away from a jquery ui button?
[19:32:51] <lenswipee> relipse: i'm guessing defocus()
[19:32:57] <relipse> lol
[19:32:59] <lenswipee> ? defocus
[19:32:59] <relipse> its .blur()
[19:33:01] <bot-t> lenswipee, .focusout() | jQuery API Documentation - Bind an event handler to the "focusout" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[19:33:10] <relipse> ? blur

[19:33:34] <relipse> how do i execute something in the chrome console without clicking it?
[19:34:19] <raj> how can i run $.each() 4 times? without making the collection [0,1,2,3] explicitly?
[19:35:43] <relipse> stop after 4 iterations, returning false ?
[19:35:58] <relipse> although it sounds like a bad way of doing it
[19:36:06] <relipse> what are you really trying to do
[19:38:30] <shoky> raj: what about new Array(4)  ?
[19:38:58] <raj> hey shoky :)
[19:39:02] <shoky> relipse: did you try solutions found on google/SO ?
[19:39:04] <shoky> hey raj ;p
[19:39:13] <lenswipee> shoky: what is the recommended way of preventing default action? returning false or e.preventDefault()?
[19:39:16] <relipse> shoky: yeah check this out
[19:39:17] <shoky> y u keep sayin hi to me and then disappearin
[19:39:32] <raj> Dude, my life has been frantic and sucking
[19:39:33] <raj> sorry
[19:39:35] <shoky> lenswipee: preventDefault
[19:39:44] <raj> It will continnue to suck till august
[19:39:50] <shoky> o, sorry ;[
[19:39:58] <lenswipee> shoky: thanks
[19:40:08] <raj> I'm actually trying to do something a little devious right now
[19:40:13] <raj> pm? :)
[19:40:34] <relipse> lenswipee: preventDefault
[19:40:55] <lenswipee> relipse: also thanks :)
[19:42:13] <raj> if I change `temp_id`'s value, will `id` get changed too?
[19:42:20] <raj> var id = temp_id = GM_getValue('city_id_list', [1,4,3,0])
[19:42:55] <raj> for example, if I pop out some of the items in that array
[19:44:04] <relipse> shoky: can you login to http://jim.clearbugs.com/members/?theme=humanity test_test_test admin testtest and tell me why "All Open Issues (refresh)" is unclickable even though i set the z-index really really high
[19:47:33] <raj> ok, better question, how can I prevent `id` from changing when I change `temp_id`?
[19:48:24] <relipse> what is temp id?
[19:48:39] <relipse> if temp_id is an object
[19:48:45] <raj> if I do `id = temp_id = [1,2,3]`
[19:48:47] <relipse> then you might have problems
[19:48:58] <relipse> seems like more of a #javascript problems
[19:48:59] <shoky> relipse: z-index needs the element to be positioned.  put position:relative on that element too
[19:49:07] <raj> yes, this is true
[19:49:08] <relipse> ok will try shoky
[19:50:19] <shoky> raj if they're both referencing the same array then changes to the array will affect both
[19:50:43] <shoky> raj: you can clone the array and have each of them reference a different array
[19:51:01] <raj> how's that done?
[19:51:43] <shoky> raj: depends if you want a shallow or deep copy
[19:51:52] <raj> shallow probably
[19:52:01] <relipse> shoky: sweet, that worked, thanks (position: relative)
[19:52:09] <shoky> but to just clone the first level you can do  arr.slice()
[19:52:11] <relipse> you probably want deep actually
[19:52:27] <relipse> so your references in temp_id don't change id
[19:52:32] <shoky> if his array looks like [1,2,3] then he won't need deep
[19:52:36] <relipse> true
[19:52:47] <shoky> or even if its [obj1, obj2, obj3]
[19:53:11] <shoky> and he's not changing the objects themselves. (or he changes them but wants to see that change in the other array too)
[19:55:51] <Draxelis> I want to alter text on a button on every click. On first click it would show "1", second "2", third "1", fourth "2". Like i toggle
[19:56:17] <Draxelis> I use replaceWith but text stays the same once clicked
[19:56:46] <shoky> Draxelis: don't use replaceWith. use .text() or .html()
[19:57:03] <shoky> replaceWith removes the old element (and any events bound to it)
[19:57:12] <relipse> weird
[19:57:27] <relipse> you know a lot of jquery details
[19:57:36] <relipse> do you freelance for a living?
[19:57:42] <Draxelis> shoky ok, so how to return to initial value (text) after second click?
[19:58:55] <shoky> relipse: i do a bit of freelance here and there, but mostly i got a regular "office" job (tho i do a lot of it from home lately)
[19:59:10] <relipse> you do jquery at work?
[19:59:19] <shoky> Draxelis: same way you put the other value
[19:59:24] <relipse> Draxelis .text()
[19:59:30] <relipse> gets you the value
[19:59:44] <Draxelis> shoky ye but how to make to behave like toggle?
[19:59:54] <relipse> a little bit of logic
[20:00:02] <relipse> Draxelis: text() == '1' ?
[20:00:14] <Draxelis> no
[20:00:19] <relipse> text($().text() == '1' ? '2' : '1')
[20:00:22] <relipse> what about that?
[20:00:37] <shoky> relipse: also jquery but other stuff too like java & c++
[20:00:39] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/G3jJg/
[20:00:45] <relipse> sweet i would love a c++ job
[20:00:54] <relipse> started c++ when I was young
[20:01:19] <shoky> yep same here
[20:01:32] <relipse> Draxelis: no ?
[20:01:37] <Eviltwin> C++ was the first language I learned formally
[20:01:40] <relipse> me too
[20:01:42] <relipse> i love it
[20:01:43] <lenswipee> Java is for the young now.
[20:01:47] <Eviltwin> Now I don't particularly care for C++
[20:01:56] <Eviltwin> I have more of an affection for C than C++
[20:01:58] <Draxelis> relipse,  text($().text() == '1' ? '2' : '1') this looks too complicated
[20:02:07] <relipse> its what you asked for
[20:02:09] <relipse> confirm with shoky
[20:02:10] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: What language you use now?
[20:02:15] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: http://jsfiddle.net/G3jJg/
[20:02:20] <Blackbox> what does the $.event.fix does i found it in a source that passed this to a fuction what is its use
[20:02:24] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: Depends on the problem I'm trying to solve
[20:02:40] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: A web based one.
[20:02:44] <relipse> Draxelis: google ternary operator
[20:02:56] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: PHP mostly for web back end
[20:02:57] <Draxelis> Eviltwin,  thanks!
[20:03:03] <Eviltwin> Although most of my work is JavaScript
[20:03:10] <ihelpsu> lenswipee: "Java is for the young now." -- wtf.. it's python and ruby
[20:03:13] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: Web front end?
[20:03:14] <shoky> yah i don't care much for C++ either.  but <3 C
[20:03:22] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: ... JavaScript
[20:03:28] <ihelpsu> and j
[20:03:34] <ihelpsu> js*
[20:04:07] <lenswipee> ihelpsu: Sure in the streets, but I was talking about Universities.
[20:04:17] <Eviltwin> Blackbox: $.event.fix is not something you be calling directly
[20:04:32] <Eviltwin> Blackbox: But it's used for jQuery to copy an event and add its own methods etc
[20:04:46] <Eviltwin> ...and he's gone
[20:05:05] <ihelpsu> lenswipee: in universties, it's python
[20:05:11] <ihelpsu> the good ones
[20:05:17] <relipse2> Eviltwin: but anyway cute answer
[20:05:19] <ihelpsu> like Stanford , MIT, etc.
[20:05:24] <Blackbox> EvilEmpire: i found it in one of the plugins source code
[20:05:27] <relipse2> i wouldn't of thought of it in a million years
[20:05:42] <Draxelis> :) trying to tailor your example to my page
[20:05:52] <relipse2> but anyway Draxelis: you should still google ternary operator
[20:06:38] <Draxelis> ok
[20:06:38] <eet6646> <ternaryoperator3
[20:06:50] <Eviltwin> <?:3 ?
[20:08:01] <eet6646> (<3) ? "<3" : "</3"
[20:08:31] <relipse2> value = value_is_2 ? 1 : 2;
[20:08:39] <Eviltwin> Really it should be called the conditional expression operator
[20:08:49] <Eviltwin> People call it the ternary operator because it's the only one with three operands
[20:08:55] <relipse2> exactly
[20:09:01] <eet6646> ternary sounds jazzy though
[20:09:03] <relipse2> it does
[20:09:45] <Draxelis> Eviltwin,  if I wanted to change text in span then instead of "button" i would use "span.myclass" right?
[20:09:58] <Blackbox> what the plugin first did was to redefine .event.fix by passing to it the same and then passed the browsers event and returned a jQuery event object , now how is that usefull
[20:10:47] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ Blackbox
[20:10:47] <bot-t> Blackbox, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[20:11:02] <Eviltwin> Show us what it actually did
[20:11:20] <relipse2> i feel really stupid but how do i delete an element in an array keeping the indeces in order for all elements
[20:11:48] <dcherman> relipse2: .splice
[20:12:58] <alleZSoyez> hey, umm, quick question... does the "this" keyword have any place in jQuery? I'm like 99% sure I'm using it wrong...
[20:13:16] <Eviltwin> alleZSoyez: Yes, it does
[20:13:18] <shoky> alleZSoyez: since jquery is javascript, definitely yes
[20:13:22] <Blackbox> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/gKDHe/ here it is the first function
[20:13:35] <Draxelis> Eviltwin,  why doesnt this work http://jsfiddle.net/G3jJg/1/?
[20:14:03] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Draxelis
[20:14:04] <bot-t> Draxelis, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:14:06] <lenswipee> hey, how is this dialog option writtin in css? position: [770,40];
[20:14:29] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: Un, left: ...; right: ...?
[20:14:51] <alleZSoyez> ah, thank you. still trying to figure out exactly how it's supposed to be used
[20:14:58] <lenswipee> position: relative; top: 770px; right:40px?
[20:15:05] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ alleZSoyez
[20:15:05] <bot-t> alleZSoyez, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:15:06] <dcherman> Blackbox: you don't need to overwrite $.event.fix, just add "clipboardData" to $.event.props if you don't want to have to access it via .originalEvent
[20:15:08] <Eviltwin> I suggest reading that second docuemnt
[20:15:12] <lenswipee> not sure if it's top,bottom,left, right
[20:15:43] <Draxelis> Eviltwin, if instead "1" and "2", i needed "yes" "no", how would that code differ?
[20:17:12] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: You wouldn't use subtraction for one thing
[20:17:15] <Eviltwin> Have you programmed before?
[20:17:30] <Draxelis> ye
[20:17:39] <Blackbox> Eviltwin:thanks for that , but then i found this code and want to know can you just explain why that was done ?
[20:18:03] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: What have you programmed before?
[20:18:29] <Draxelis> I mentioned 1&2 as an example, but in reality i need altering  text like "yes" "no"
[20:18:37] <Eviltwin> Blackbox: It looks like the intent was to extend the clipboardData property from the original event on to jQuery's event object
[20:18:56] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: Well your example allowed you to shortcut in the fashion I showed
[20:19:14] <Eviltwin> If you want yes and no you'll have to do that scary thing relipse was talking about
[20:19:23] <Draxelis> ;/
[20:19:29] <relipse2> Draxelis: why don't you just do what i told you
[20:19:34] <relipse2> its called a ternary operator
[20:19:35] <Blackbox> Thanks a lot .
[20:19:46] <relipse2> or use an if statement if you are scared
[20:19:56] <relipse2> if (text() == '2'){ text('1'); }
[20:20:00] <relipse2> else{ ....
[20:20:09] <Eviltwin> Notice that he's abbreviating the syntax
[20:20:10] <Draxelis> nice relipse2  just googled it and it's billion results:))
[20:20:22] <Eviltwin> If you paste literally what he typed it won't work
[20:20:27] <relipse2> msg me when you are done reading
[20:20:33] <relipse2> of course i'm not going to newbie feed
[20:20:34] <relipse2> lol
[20:20:43] <relipse2> like eviltwin setting him a fiddle
[20:20:55] <Eviltwin> I knew he didn't actually want 1 and 2
[20:20:59] <duckx0r> How can I get the parent div that is a member of a specific class? I do var $parent = $(this).closest('div.tour_main'); but that doesn't seem to work because when I do $parent.fadeOut(); it doesn't do anything.
[20:21:06] <relipse2> well in that case it was a cruel joke
[20:21:08] <relipse2> lol;
[20:21:11] <relipse2> and devious
[20:21:30] <Eviltwin> I guess I'm living up to my name
[20:21:35] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: I can't seem to style a jQuery dialog using a stylesheet. As soon as I remove position: [x,y] in the script, and try to style it in the css the dialog displays wrong, no title for example
[20:22:02] <Draxelis> hm.. i wonder why  some people behave like that.
[20:22:05] <Eviltwin> lenswipee: Your problem was no where close to clearly defined. You seemed to be asking how to specify position in CSS
[20:22:41] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: If you always have other people solve your problems for you, you'll never learn to solve them yourself
[20:22:41] <relipse2> draxelis: $('#mybutton').text( $('#mybutton').text() == 'yes' ? 'no' : 'yes' );
[20:22:46] <ihelpsu> this is not even for css wtf ppl
[20:22:47] <ihelpsu> xD
[20:23:04] <relipse2> i feel like i just fed a newbie
[20:23:07] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ duckx0r
[20:23:07] <b-ot> duckx0r: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:23:07] <bot-t> duckx0r, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:23:14] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: I can position in CSS but then the dialog displays odd like missing Dialog title, even though I have set it in the script
[20:23:15] <relipse2> ?rtfm
[20:23:15] <bot-t> http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[20:23:18] <Blackbox> dcherman: i don't find any documentation about the fix method but then googled and found that it returns a jQuery object thats normalized so is that the reson it was passed to fix instead of directly attaching the clipboadData property to $.event?
[20:23:59] <Eviltwin> Blackbox: $.event.fix is not documented because you're not supposed to use it
[20:24:08] <Eviltwin> And there's a chance it could go away or change meaning somewhere in the future
[20:24:16] <Eviltwin> Someone with the name Blackbox should appreciate that
[20:24:52] <lenswipee> Eviltwin: In summary, positioning dialog in CSS ruins the jQuery CSS and everything needs to be redone. strange.
[20:24:56] <dcherman> Blackbox: it was done because whoever wrote that didn't know about $.event.props
[20:25:01] <Draxelis> Eviltwin,  you are wrong, because problems are not solved by others. Is it efficient to spend couple days reading about some operator ... or is it better to ask someone who could help. It's not like you code entire site for me or smth. I just asked simple thing which max need couple lines of code.
[20:25:07] <Blackbox> haha ok ok I will in future take care Eviltwin
[20:26:28] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: If you don't understand what the operators of a language are or how they work, odds are you aren't writing great code
[20:26:50] <Draxelis> Eviltwin, this is my first day with jquery
[20:27:01] <Draxelis> i know quite a bit alreaddy for a first day
[20:27:09] <Eviltwin> And how much JavaScript have you done before today?
[20:27:26] <Draxelis> none
[20:27:29] <Draxelis> today
[20:27:43] <Eviltwin> And there's going to be the source of most of your problems
[20:29:01] <Eviltwin> Asking why this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/G3jJg/1/ compared to this http://jsfiddle.net/G3jJg/ is a failure to understand JavaScript (or most dynamically-typed programming languages)
[20:29:07] <Eviltwin> Not a problem to understand jQuery
[20:29:22] <Draxelis> i can pick it up on the fly. spending many hours reading would be waste of time atm
[20:29:29] <Eviltwin> :P
[20:29:30] <Eviltwin> Good luck with that
[20:29:35] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[20:29:36] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[20:29:44] <Eviltwin> It seriously helps to learn JavaScript first
[20:30:03] <snover> man how many people are going to play this “I don’t think I need to learn the language first” game
[20:30:04] <snover> today
[20:30:14] <snover> maybe you are the same person that was doing it earlier
[20:30:16] <snover> in which case, cut it out
[20:30:25] <Eviltwin> How many people are going to keep thinking jQuery is a language
[20:30:32] <Draxelis> dont know what you are on
[20:30:53] <eet6646> why learn jquery which is a js library... without knowledge of js?
[20:30:59] <eet6646> doesnt make sense to me
[20:31:18] <Eviltwin> Doesn't make sense to anyone who really knows jQuery
[20:31:29] <Draxelis> hey
[20:31:55] <Draxelis> seeing results of js takes alot of time
[20:32:06] <Draxelis> with jq it's much quicker
[20:32:07] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, this is what I have, but I don't know how to make it execute the javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/t5EAh/
[20:32:09] <Eviltwin> Which is why instead of just dicking around changing things
[20:32:14] <Eviltwin> You should actually learn the language
[20:32:17] <alleZSoyez> I don't know, I'm a newbie with this too; I DO have programming experience but have never had much luck with JavaScript, but then found jQuery and it somehow makes a lot more sense... so now I'm kinda learning both at the same time
[20:32:19] <Draxelis> and still you can pick up js
[20:33:05] <dcherman> Draxelis: jQuery IS javascript.  you're going to have a hell of a time doing anything more than simple stuff without knowing how to work with JS.
[20:33:17] <Eviltwin> You're advocating reading a manual in French on how to build a website without knowing French
[20:33:22] <relipse2> Draxelis: how old are you?
[20:33:24] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, was that to me?
[20:33:26] <relipse2> curiously
[20:33:32] <Eviltwin> duckx0r: No
[20:33:44] <Eviltwin> duckx0r: So on line 27 (var $parent = $(this).closest('div.tour_main');)
[20:33:50] <Eviltwin> Which "this" is that supposed to be?
[20:34:00] <ihelpsu> i likes -- "[22:29] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)"
[20:34:06] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, the button
[20:34:11] <Draxelis> ok everyone learn js first
[20:34:12] <Draxelis> :)
[20:34:18] <relipse2> how do i remove the event handler?
[20:34:19] <Eviltwin> ihelpsu: I added that after getting tired of so many people trying to skip the JavaScript
[20:34:24] <relipse2> how do i remove click() event handler?
[20:34:35] <ihelpsu> what... ppl are actually doing that...
[20:34:40] <Eviltwin> duckx0r: What you want to do is move that up outside the request.done(...) thing
[20:34:40] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, sorry, in this case it's the form
[20:35:00] <Eviltwin> duckx0r: Because "this" only stays the same until you go inside another function (...) { ... }
[20:35:10] <eet6646> Draxelis: "and still you can pick up js" ... if you take the time to learn a language correctly and not just "pick it up" it would benefit long term. Greater, more efficient code.
[20:35:11] <relipse2> .off('click');
[20:35:24] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, ahhh. that is true. thanks.
[20:35:38] <Eviltwin> duckx0r: Either that or do var button = this
[20:35:49] <Eviltwin> Inside the submit(function(event) { ... })
[20:35:57] <Eviltwin> And then do var $parent = $(button).closest(...)
[20:36:03] <eet6646> If only my co-workers would take the time to learn JS
[20:36:08] <Draxelis> my goal isnt to be the best js programmer ever lol
[20:36:15] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: Is your goal to be the worst?
[20:36:29] <Draxelis> no goal
[20:36:38] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, I'll give it a go. Thanks.
[20:37:27] <ihelpsu>  "no goal" -- i like this one too..
[20:37:40] <lenswipee> So who is wining?
[20:37:49] <eet6646> Draxelis: That's aside the point... Sure if you want to complete a project and never use JS again in your life you can aimlessly search google
[20:38:10] <snover> when you have no goals it is easy not to be disappointed when you end up doing nothing
[20:38:18] <Draxelis> =))
[20:38:19] <relipse2> any of you guys got any good ideas for like info boxes (that appear onhover) ?
[20:38:27] <eet6646> Draxelis: But on IRC channels dedicated to specific subjects, not a good idea if you don't intend to actually learn
[20:38:34] <Draxelis> no goal to be a progammer for a living
[20:38:37] <Draxelis> lol
[20:38:46] <relipse2> you can always pay me $75/hr
[20:38:49] <relipse2> and i'll do it for you
[20:38:55] <lenswipee> Draxelis: You must have some goal!
[20:39:17] <Draxelis> I do, but not to be pro js coder
[20:39:24] <ihelpsu> snover: actually if they have no goals, they wont be disappoint by doing nothing
[20:39:26] <lenswipee> Draxelis: Well what is it?
[20:39:28] <Draxelis> I need it to get around
[20:39:29] <Draxelis> :)
[20:39:32] <duckx0r> Eviltwin, yes, got it working.
[20:39:37] <dcherman> relipse2: 75$/hr is cheap for a consultant =P
[20:39:51] <relipse2> i tend to take whatever i can get dcherman
[20:39:53] <relipse2> lol
[20:40:03] <ihelpsu> Draxelis: DONT WORRY, there will always be at least one person who will help someone will extreme basics when havent sat down and read anything -- so you dont worry
[20:40:13] <lenswipee> dcherman: what is not cheap for a consultant?
[20:40:15] <relipse2> there will always be one newbie feeder
[20:40:33] <Draxelis> :)
[20:40:49] <Draxelis> not sure what you are talking about
[20:40:52] <dcherman> lenswipee: that's a whole different topic, and it heavily depends on if consulting/freelancing is your lifeblood, or if you're just moonlighting
[20:41:11] <dcherman> in either case, don't sell yourself short.  not doing yourself any favors.
[20:41:43] <lenswipee> dcherman: o_O give $ amount for what is not cheap?
[20:42:33] <lenswipee> dcherman: $150/hr ? $200? $500?
[20:42:33] <dcherman> lenswipee: sure.  120$.  now of course i pulled that $ out of my ass because i have no data on your experience level or life/financial needs.
[20:43:43] <lenswipee> dcherman: the $ amount shouldn't be based on my level of experience! it should be based on the usual charges for a pro consultant. I'm just curious as you said $75 was cheap
[20:44:17] <dcherman> lenswipee: if freelancing is your only source of income and assuming a normal 40hr work week is desired, you can't depend on working 40hrs per week consistently.  but for the sake of argument, let's say you do have that guarantee
[20:44:50] <dcherman> that's 3k income per week.  as a self employed person ( at least in the US ), you're responsible for your own income taxes, and the full 12.5% of FICA taxes on top of that
[20:45:17] <eet6646> $$ SHOULD be based on level of experience as well as quality. Also depending on the competition in the area
[20:45:37] <dcherman> you also don't have health benefits.  assuming you like not dying of a disease or potentially being bankrupted, i assume you'll want health insurance
[20:46:03] <dcherman> which you need to provide on how own - that's rather expensive.  take that out of your 3k income per week ( which again, is not a guaranteed # )
[20:46:17] <lenswipee> dcherman: umm if you're dying of a disease you will still want health insurance.
[20:46:19] <dcherman> you quickly realize that 75$ per hour is cheap
[20:46:46] <Draxelis> ye, it's nothin
[20:46:53] <Draxelis> peanuts
[20:46:55] <lenswipee> dcherman: $75/hr is cheap, it's more like $150/hr
[20:46:58] <Draxelis> :D
[20:47:00] <dcherman> that's not including rent/mortgage, food, car, etc...
[20:47:01] <Eviltwin> Draxelis makes that much writing jQuery
[20:47:04] <Eviltwin> And it's hist first day
[20:47:28] <Draxelis> more than that
[20:47:29] <Draxelis> :)
[20:47:34] <Draxelis> but not for jq
[20:47:36] <Draxelis> :D
[20:48:21] <Eviltwin> Draxelis: And you're not just hiring someone better at jQuery because...? :P
[20:48:37] <Draxelis> experience mate  experience
[20:48:43] <Draxelis> :)
[20:48:44] <relipse> dag what ballpark do you make a year?
[20:48:46] <relipse> dcherman
[20:48:57] <relipse> over $95?
[20:49:23] <dcherman> relipse: i dont freelance for a living for the reason that after looking into it heavily, i decided it wasn't for me.
[20:49:33] <relipse> haha i make like leftover crumbs if you make $75/hr
[20:49:50] <relipse> but yeah freelancing sucks
[20:50:03] <relipse> you gotta charge high end over $60/hr if you want to provide
[20:50:43] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I like having my employer take care of insurance and what not
[20:50:45] <dcherman> relipse: most things i've read have recommended charging on either a daily basis, or preferably a per project basis
[20:51:28] <relipse> that might be better but hourly is the best because you actually get paid for what you work
[20:51:33] <relipse> i've underestimated so many times
[20:51:48] <dcherman> Eviltwin: Yep, agree completely.  That's not even taking into consideration that I'm really shitty at marketing, and as a freelancer you need to market yourself extremely well
[20:52:06] <relipse> i just take what they give me because i suck
[20:52:34] <dcherman> relipse: Need to work on your project management skills then :)
[20:53:05] <dcherman> relipse: That's not saying you're slow, but always say it's probably 50% longer than you think it will be
[20:53:21] <relipse> actually its more like 250%
[20:53:31] <relipse> i estimated 15 hours on something that took me over 40
[20:53:35] <relipse> boss was ticked
[20:53:45] <relipse> i should just multiply my estimate by 10
[20:53:46] <duckx0r> Is there any way to determine (not programatically, just to know what it is) what function is called when an element is clicked? Like something in firebug maybe?
[20:53:51] <Eviltwin> I feel like I was a faster coder in high school
[20:54:00] <Eviltwin> But maybe I just didn't write code that was as versitile
[20:54:03] <relipse> i'm a dog slow coder
[20:54:09] <relipse> but i feel i do a good job
[20:54:21] <dcherman> I'll bet you wrote more code, but it wasn't as good
[20:54:22] <Eviltwin> I'm a fast coder and I still feel like I'm not as fast as I used to be
[20:59:21] <relipse> maybe we should band together and compete with a coding challenge
[20:59:27] <relipse> in 3 different languages
[20:59:33] <relipse> c++, javascript, and java
[20:59:42] <relipse> 10 of us compete
[21:00:12] <relipse> the winner gets $300
[21:00:20] <relipse> coming from our sponsor
[21:00:41] <relipse> donationcoder.com
[21:01:58] <relipse> no takers?
[21:01:59] <relipse> lol
[21:02:03] <relipse> fine whatever i'll go back to work
[21:06:53] <Swapnesh> Hi all..may i know what type of hovering effect(image zoom) is applied for images on this site http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/
[21:07:09] <Swapnesh> any tut/link will be greatly appreciated
[21:10:09] <lenswipee> Swapnesh: Yes, I grant you that you may know.
[21:11:12] <Swapnesh> lenswipee i searched in the page source ..but no js(relevant to this)
[21:11:45] <Swapnesh> searching with image zoom keyword in google not giving me the correct results
[21:11:55] <lenswipee> Swapnesh: It's a simple re-size of image on hover.... i think
[21:12:19] <lenswipee> Swapnesh: the image is made slightly bigger i believe
[21:12:21] <Swapnesh> aahh ook lenswipee thx ..let me search with this keyword
[21:12:26] <Zed7> hey, does anyone know why this isnt working?: $("#delivery-calculator-order-date").datepicker({ altFormat: "dd-mm-yy" });
[21:12:51] <lenswipee> Swapnesh: i don't think it's a proper zoom/scaling, but others might know better
[21:13:38] <Swapnesh> lenswipee actually if u checked the div size remains the same but image size expands with a smooth transition
[21:13:47] <Swapnesh> so i thought it might be from a plugin
[21:14:13] <Talon_> its a background zoom, the element you're hovering over is actually a span
[21:14:59] <lenswipee> how you do background zoom? can it be done natively using css?
[21:15:31] <Swapnesh> okk Talon_ thx for more constructive info
[21:15:53] <Swapnesh> let me google it..or you have any link/tut..pprovide me one :)
[21:16:35] <lenswipee> lol
[21:17:00] <Talon_> looks pretty simple, I'll see if I can mimic it.
[21:24:17] <lenswipee> Talon_: Yeah do a jsfiddle
[21:30:01] <Swapnesh> Talon_ Talon_ sorry lost my internet connection..please let me know if u provided any link that i missed in between
[21:32:26] <Swapnesh> lenswipee do i missed something in between ?
[21:33:21] <lenswipee> Swapnesh: Talon said he/she will create a testcase of what you want in a jsfiddle.
[21:33:59] <Swapnesh> ohh wow ..thx lenswipee ..i thought i missed something g8 in between :)
[21:34:42] <Talon_> Swapnesh: http://jsfiddle.net/LTfzZ/1/ <== here is the theory, I just didn't do the animation.
[21:36:01] <Swapnesh> Talon_ ohh thx a lot man(if ur a man)..otherwise still a lot thx 2 u :)
[21:36:28] <lenswipee> Talon_: nice work
[21:37:00] <Swapnesh> lenswipee yeah really appreciate his/her efforts
[21:37:15] <lenswipee> Is there a rule when to use <img> over <background>?
[21:38:16] <Talon_> Swapnesh: http://jsfiddle.net/LTfzZ/2/ <== example 2 animated
[21:39:15] <Swapnesh> Talon_ OMG..OMG really awesome
[21:50:15] <Talon_> darn isp...
[21:54:57] <Swapnesh> Talon_ what happened?
[21:55:28] <Talon_> no clue, it randomly likes to drop me every so many hours...
[21:56:09] <Blackbox> simple question , here in this code  http://jsfiddle.net/gKDHe/ what does this refere to is it the jQuery ($) object and if yes then  what does the line 25 and 26 mean ?
[21:57:00] <Blackbox> about the abouve question 'this' at line 23 i mean
[21:59:19] <Talon_> i'd say 23 = the main function, 25 is part of an each loop so this reflects to the iterated element at the time, and 26 is a JQuery object of the element rather than the element itself.
[22:07:42] <Zed7> Hey, I am having trouble changing the format of the datepicker
[22:07:54] <Swapnesh> hey Talon_ I used this script but its not working ...no error in console
[22:07:55] <Swapnesh> http://pastebin.com/YxEusEXp
[22:07:55] <Zed7> here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/Fa8Xx/427/
[22:08:19] <Zed7> can anyone see what is wrong with this code?
[22:08:22] <Swapnesh> Talon_ this is where i am using this time http://sbp.siteprogress.info/
[22:08:39] <Swapnesh> on slider image
[22:23:08] <Swapnesh> any guess ??
[22:25:26] <Talon_> the css between the two aren't even remotely the same so of course it won't work.
[22:26:53] <Talon_> best bet is jquery ui, make a custom widget class to do the whole slider thing and zoom, so it'd be super simple to use. or at least thats how i'd do it.
[22:27:45] <Talon_> im no expert tho, I might get flamed for the suggestion lol
[22:29:33] <Swapnesh> Talon_ at times i really feel myself as a complete noob in jQuery..do u know any good resource for learning ..PRACTICALLY apart from the jQuery site of course
[22:30:47] <Talon_> nope, i'm a noob to it myself, I just use the API documentation.
[22:40:05] <jeremy-> I'm trying to get around a race condition, I'm using jquery validate and I'm displaying a bootstrap css class for validations errors when a field focuses
[22:40:14] <jeremy-> I also want to display an extra custom "tick" or "cross" next to the field
[22:40:46] <jeremy-> I'm using .after() to display the tick/cross, but it always goes after the jquery.validate() css because of a race condition, any ideas?
[22:41:12] <jeremy-> is there any delay, reset or something like that i can use
[22:54:47] <ihelpsu> Swapnesh: i have everything here for you, just tell me what is the best eventually --

[22:58:30] <Swapnesh> ihelpsu Actually I too follow stack for questions but sometimes I feel..people answer according to thr preferances ..so may be something good for other may not be the right to actually follow
[23:00:21] <ihelpsu> Swapnesh: stackexcahgne sites? it's best to get grounds on js, then for jquery, you Always start with a quality guide (that is structured, tells you what's important, and other good things), i would never start with anything messy like stackexchange
[23:00:49] <ihelpsu> ^ this is for ppl starting out tho
[23:01:23] <fat> why isn't my animate() working? i read the readme properly http://jsfiddle.net/6VDWX/4/
[23:02:49] <ihelpsu> Swapnesh: quora is always really good -- http://www.quora.com/jQuery -- it's probaly the #1 site and i have >32,000 sites blocked on https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef

[23:03:19] <ihelpsu> fat: so you jsut moved the divs and it was fine?
[23:03:32] <fat> ihelpsu: is was fiddling around with divs accidenntly
[23:03:41] <fat> then i was onto something, and i changed few codes and it works
[23:03:44] <ihelpsu> fat: so it wasnt a table, it was a div holding the data?
[23:03:46] <fat> ill screenshot for u
[23:04:06] <ihelpsu> fat: you can just say generally what caused the problem
[23:04:22] <fat> ihelpsu: i dont knwo what caused it, i fixed it accidently
[23:04:29] <ihelpsu> hahhaah
[23:05:23] <fat> ihelpsu: http://uploadnow.org/image/348703-lolp.png

[23:08:39] <fat> (just  for testing purposes)
[23:08:42] <ihelpsu> ah
[23:09:04] <ihelpsu> [01:01] <fat> why isn't my animate() working? i read the readme properly http://jsfiddle.net/6VDWX/4/
[23:11:33] <fat> ihelpsu: the game is  Star Wars: The Old Republic if u want to know
[23:17:54] <jop008> Someone using IE9?
[23:18:11] <jop008> I have a login faillure which I don't understand
[23:19:00] <jop008> http://altena.touchingservices.nl try to login using user john pw john can yo get in?
[23:19:50] <Cork> ihelpsu: the documentation seams out of date
[23:20:13] <Cork> ihelpsu: the lib expects textObjects to contain positions, and that is why it crashes
[23:20:51] <Cork> jop008: try moving the script block into head
[23:21:50] <jop008> My code is now in an include file
[23:22:05] <jop008> must I have all my includes in head?
[23:22:33] <fat> jop008: i logged it, it works
[23:22:41] <jop008> great !
[23:23:01] <jop008> Strange I can't get in
[23:23:08] <jop008> Cache cleared
[23:23:27] <fat> jop008: firefox
[23:23:31] <jop008> throwing an error message pointing to console
[23:23:46] <jop008> but the problem is only in IE9
[23:24:04] <jop008> all other browsers as to my knowledge is working fine
[23:24:37] <Cork> jop008: ie doens't have console.* if the developer tools isn't opened
[23:24:47] <Cork> just so you remember that
[23:25:08] <Cork> jop008: also i meant the inline script block with the ready code in it
[23:25:27] <Cork> as ready triggers a bit unpredictable in ie
[23:25:34] <Cork> (unless it is in head)
[23:25:46] <Cork> or put the script tag at the end of the body, and remove the ready callback
[23:26:07] <jop008> I have in my lib.js file this code console = console || {};
[23:26:07] <jop008> console.log = console.log || function(){};
[23:26:19] <ihelpsu> Cork: i those two comments were meant for someone else? if teh first is for me, the docs for jquery are outdated? that would be good to know
[23:26:20] <jop008> which test for console stuf
[23:26:42] <Cork> ihelpsu: yes the first was for you
[23:26:48] <Cork> ihelpsu: check your error console
[23:27:11] <ihelpsu> lol.. ur msgs...
[23:27:13] <Cork> ihelpsu: TypeError: textObject.positions[animationPosition] is undefined <--
[23:27:25] <evaluate> Hello.
[23:27:40] <ihelpsu> Cork: well its good to know the docs are outdated, which means a quality textbook would be better for later on
[23:28:03] <evaluate> Is it possible to combine multiple selectors into one? I tried $('type="checkbox",name="something"'), but it doesn't seem to work...
[23:28:30] <Cork> evaluate: yes, except those selectors is invalid even on there own
[23:28:49] <Cork> $('input[type="checkbox"],input[name="something"]')
[23:29:15] <evaluate> Cork, why exactly are they invalid? If I do just $('name="something"'), it works just fine...
[23:29:51] <Cork> evaluate: cause there can't be any <name="something"></name="something"> elements in the page
[23:29:55] <evaluate> Sorry, I mean $('[name="something"]')
[23:30:04] <Cork> that is another matter
[23:30:21] <Cork> so ya, $('[type="checkbox"],[name="something"]')
[23:30:33] <evaluate> Cork, ok, thank you very much!
[23:30:44] <Cork> or, $('[type="checkbox"][name="something"]') if you want an and selector
[23:31:06] <evaluate> Would the one with the comma be an 'or' selector?
[23:31:12] <Cork> yes
[23:31:15] <evaluate> I see.
[23:31:22] <Cork> evaluate: just like in css
[23:31:34] <evaluate> Ohh, makes sense...
[23:31:36] <evaluate> :-)
[23:31:55] <tasslehoff> I just found out that serialize()-ing my form does not include submit button data. I also read why. My question is what you think is the proper way to solve this. Some posts talk about using a hidden element. Is that good practice?
[23:32:15] <evaluate> Cork, thanks again!
[23:32:26] <anton164> .click(false) would disable a click event, but to reverse that after, I guess it would simply be .click(true) ?
[23:33:06] <Cork> Antiga: no click doesn't take true/false
[23:33:32] <Cork> you would either have to unbind the event handler, or make an if check in the handler
[23:33:54] <Cork> if($(this).data('disabled')) { event.preventDefault(); return; }
[23:34:14] <Cork> tasslehoff: sadly that is the only way
[23:34:23] <anton164> Thanks Cork
[23:34:26] <Cork> tasslehoff: make sure to set autocomplete="off" on it though
[23:34:56] <Cork> tasslehoff: else it will "remember" the state of the button on a page reload, and things might break
[23:35:27] <Cork> opps meant anton164 not Antiga
[23:35:37] <anton164> Yeah, haha, I figured :)
[23:37:25] <tasslehoff> Cork: ok. going about this the wrong way, fixing the webpage first, and then hopefully learning jquery/javascript/html :)
[23:39:48] <granden> Hi, could anyone recommend a nice touch/swipe plugin for jquery? I tried, swipeTouch but if I make the div that I binds to swipe a <a> link then it wont work. Like: <div id='swipediv'></div> swipeing in the div works. But <a href="/"><div id='swipediv'></div></a> wont work.
[23:51:54] <jeremy-> granden: you should look at the width / size dimensions of the nested <div> inside the <a> , make sure that the div is actually the same size as <A>
[23:52:55] <Cork> and i cry a little when i see someone wrap a block element inside an inline element
