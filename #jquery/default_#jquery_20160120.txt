[00:25:12] <badcss> Anyone around?
[01:27:43] <DexDeadly> Heres a question. I have a page that submits a form to a page which checks if the passwords correct.  I'd like to know if the password is incorrect to go back to the previous page and resubmit the form data thats already been submited on that page
[02:18:49] <chunts> any sr devs/managers here?
[03:09:48] <hellyeah> mrning
[03:09:50] <hellyeah> morning
[03:10:05] <DirtyFinn> morning
[03:10:50] <hellyeah> i want to disable the button for this i do something in line 131 and 132 but it doesnt work as i expected can you help me to figure out why https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/46/
[03:12:51] <DirtyFinn> if you want to disable button why not use $('button').attr("disabled", true);
[03:13:15] <DirtyFinn> the opposite (enable) of that is $('button').attr("disabled", false);
[03:13:40] <DirtyFinn> oh, you want to do that after it's clicked. okay
[03:13:45] <DirtyFinn> then nevermind :)
[03:15:38] <DirtyFinn> what is it exactly you're expecting to happen? to me it seems this works
[03:15:55] <hellyeah> well
[03:16:10] <hellyeah> i just want to avoid button not doing anything when you click
[03:16:23] <hellyeah> now it works https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/48/
[03:19:07] <DirtyFinn> it also works without event.preventDefault(); (which is meant to prevent default action of an iten. you haven't created default action here :)) and  event.stopPropagation();
[03:20:48] <hellyeah> i suuppose it avois something to work
[03:21:59] <hellyeah> DirtyFinn: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5632031/how-to-stop-default-link-click-behavior-with-jquery
[03:22:30] <DirtyFinn> <button> element doesn't have default action. <input type="submit"> has. And so does <a>. With those two you could use preventDefault() but with <button> it doesn't do anything
[03:22:46] <DirtyFinn> yes
[03:24:01] <hellyeah> ah
[03:24:14] <hellyeah> preventDefault() not working for button
[03:24:26] <hellyeah> what am i gnna do?
[03:25:10] <DirtyFinn> you don't need to do anything
[03:26:52] <arc_> you should usually use .prop() instead of .attr() especially for booleans
[03:27:53] <DirtyFinn> I'm so used to .attr() :)
[03:29:18] <hellyeah> okey what is different between attr and prop
[03:29:41] <arc_> that's a complicated answer. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[03:29:49] <arc_> this page has information under "Attributes vs. Properties"
[03:30:49] <DirtyFinn> attr is for all attributes. prop is for properties. and then you need to spend 10 years with html and javascript to tell the difference between those two :)
[03:31:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:32:59] <DirtyFinn> for example (correct me if i'm wrong): <input type="checkbox" checked>  'type="checkbox"' is an attribute (it exists when the element is created).  'checked' is a property, it can change (be applied and... unapplied) after the creation of the element
[03:34:17] <DirtyFinn> 'checked="true"' would be an attribute too
[03:34:21] <DirtyFinn> I guess
[03:34:39] <hellyeah> attribute and property
[03:34:40] <hellyeah> :XD
[03:34:41] <arc_> but that just means the box will be checked by default when it is created
[03:34:53] <DirtyFinn> yes
[03:35:38] <hellyeah> but i saw thast
[03:35:46] <hellyeah> bnoth attr and prop do the same thingf
[03:35:48] <hellyeah> bnoth attr and prop do the same thing
[03:35:52] <hellyeah> ?
[03:36:36] <hellyeah> okey
[03:36:37] <hellyeah> so
[03:37:01] <hellyeah> $('#remove').attr('disabled','true');
[03:37:02] <hellyeah> ?
[03:38:03] <DirtyFinn> or $('#remove').prop('disabled');
[03:38:14] <DirtyFinn> try and see which one works
[03:38:21] <DirtyFinn> and then tell me :)
[03:38:34] <hellyeah> attr one worked https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/50/
[03:38:40] <hellyeah> let me try prop
[03:38:52] <arc_> .prop('propertyName'); returns true or false, it does not set the state of a property
[03:39:28] <hellyeah> prop not working
[03:39:41] <DirtyFinn> ok
[03:39:46] <arc_> because you must use .prop('disabled', true);
[03:40:00] <DirtyFinn> ah. okay
[03:40:14] <hellyeah> worked now https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/52/
[03:40:21] <hellyeah> true or 'true'
[03:40:35] <arc_> it does not need to be passed as a string
[03:40:36] <hellyeah> i used 'true' and worked
[03:40:43] <hellyeah> humm
[03:41:19] <hellyeah> understood
[03:42:47] <DirtyFinn> I wonder where my boss has been for the last week
[03:43:20] <DirtyFinn> guess I keep coding without his input :)
[03:44:23] <hellyeah> btw can youı check line 6 first part of if. IT is not executed https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/53/
[03:45:10] <hellyeah> if not datepicker in datePart or length is 1
[03:45:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:45:34] <hellyeah> when you dont click create there wont be cloning to datePart
[03:46:05] <DirtyFinn> isn't that how it's supposed to work?
[03:46:28] <DirtyFinn> nevermind :)
[03:46:36] <hellyeah> it should disable remove button when there şs not inputboxes
[03:48:02] <DirtyFinn> so the point is for the remove button to be disabled in the beginning (when there's not input fields yet)?
[03:48:50] <hellyeah> yes
[03:49:20] <hellyeah> imy aim here !$('.datePart').find('.datepicker')
[03:49:36] <hellyeah> select datePart and look for datePicker if there is any
[03:49:57] <hellyeah> i puıt exclamation mark for making this negative statement
[03:50:32] <DirtyFinn> when the page is created $('.datePart .datepicker').length is 0
[03:51:02] <hellyeah> i tried that
[03:51:09] <hellyeah> i didnt work
[03:51:13] <DirtyFinn> i mean: try if(!$('.datePart').find('.datepicker') || $('.datePart .datepicker').length === 0)
[03:51:16] <hellyeah> hmm i dont understand why
[03:52:21] <hellyeah> both statement seems same to me
[03:52:24] <hellyeah> i will be back
[04:37:29] <imox> morning I’m trying to use this plugin http://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/

[04:39:38] <Jellyg00se> Hi guys! did some research on CORS yesterday but still getting the error of: "TCross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://xxxx. (Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing)"..  I have header("access-control-allow-origin: *"); at the top of my PHP script, but this only fails when trying to send a FILE, all other FormData is fine... any help please?
[04:41:36] <XHFHX> Hi, can somebody tell me whats wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/5h17fdz5/
[04:49:57] <DirtyFinn> Jellyg00se, so you're trying to send file to another server? do they allow receiving files?
[04:50:58] <DirtyFinn> XHFHX, got any HTML for that?
[04:51:16] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/1jx5fgzu/ what am I doing wrong here?
[04:51:27] <Jellyg00se> DirtyFinn, well it's a shared server, so I don't know if there  can be an apache setting to disallow this? But the CORS header is set, and a standard ajax request with FormData (not including an input file field) works fine
[04:52:35] <XHFHX> DirtyFinn: Can I pm you? Don't want to share it on the full chanel ;)
[04:52:50] <DirtyFinn> Kartagis, (this).length is undefined. You might want to use $("#i").val().length or something instead
[04:53:10] <Kartagis> argh
[04:53:14] <Kartagis> thanks DirtyFinn
[04:53:21] <DirtyFinn> XHFHX, sure
[04:53:25] <DirtyFinn> np
[04:54:04] <DirtyFinn> Jellyg00se, the only idea I had was that the receiving end doesn't allow files from outside. Just a guess though
[04:56:18] <Jellyg00se> DirtyFinn, thanks for your help, I have stumbled across this https://benjaminhorn.io/code/setting-cors-cross-origin-resource-sharing-on-apache-with-correct-response-headers-allowing-everything-through/ it looks to be in the right direction, not much of a jquery question in the end though sorry about that :)
[04:58:54] <Sourcey> Hello. I need to select the next <tbody> within a (this) - How to?
[04:59:13] <Sourcey> $(this).next()....

[05:00:59] <Sourcey> I'm sorry, its not within the (this) - its after, but i need to start with (this)
[05:01:10] <Sourcey> so i dont think .find will work
[05:01:25] <DirtyFinn> Jellyg00se, that's actually helpful for me. thanks :)

[05:39:12] <kostodo> how can i make sure that there are no more than 2 of the same items in an array?
[05:41:56] <rogger_h> hey guys i have a onclick event can i do something like that onclick="myfunction($(this)) ?
[07:10:59] <kostodo> How can I extend this so that it checks for any value appearing more than 2 times in the array: http://jsfiddle.net/av8gz4e6/7/
[07:54:36] <taplar> kostodo: define 'checks'?
[07:54:46] <kostodo> taplar, thanks managed to solve it
[07:54:54] <taplar> k
[08:09:02] <Pazician> Hello all. I'm trying to animate a element when a user click on it, I've imported the Animate.css and I add a class when the user clicks on the element, the class gets added but there's no animation - what could be wrong?
[08:09:36] <slax0r> how are you animating? with css?
[08:09:47] <Tennis> perhaps there is an animat.js to go with the animate.css?
[08:09:47] <Pazician> Alexer: Yes, @keyframes
[08:09:53] <taplar> kostodo: another option http://jsfiddle.net/av8gz4e6/9/
[08:10:26] <Pazician> Tennis: No, I don't think so since it's pure .css
[08:10:36] <Pazician> And when I downloaded I got only a Animate.css
[08:10:54] <DirtyFinn> pure css can animate elements too these days
[08:11:00] <DirtyFinn> Long live CSS3!
[08:11:02] <Tennis> hmm good to know
[08:11:39] <Pazician> Been stuck with this for a while now, no idea why it's not animating...
[08:12:18] <Tennis> paste.ee some code or jsfiddle it up and ill take a look
[08:12:23] <Pazician> https://pastee.org/37397
[08:12:42] <DirtyFinn> pure css: http://bennettfeely.com/csscreatures/ :)
[08:12:46] <Pazician> https://pastee.org/veave
[08:12:57] <Pazician> Cool DirtyFinn
[08:13:49] <Tennis> is that typically sat inside a document.read etc ?
[08:13:54] <shoky> Pazician: did you read the docs about how to use this animate.css ?
[08:14:11] <Tennis> also is that 2 classes you are adding , show and bounceInDown
[08:14:25] <Pazician> Tennis: Yes, it's adding the class, the JS is working fine
[08:14:48] <Pazician> shoky: Yes I did, it's not that complicated
[08:14:52] <shoky> Pazician: assuming this is what you're using  https://github.com/daneden/animate.css#basic-usage
[08:15:01] <shoky> Pazician: right it's easy but you're not adding any "animated" class
[08:15:03] <Tennis> paste.ee the whole page? or make a jsfiddle
[08:15:53] <Tennis> it should have the animated class in the html before you add the bounceInDown right?
[08:16:10] <Tennis> also whats "show" for?
[08:16:43] <shoky> no, they even have an example:  $('#yourElement').addClass('animated bounceOutLeft');
[08:17:17] <Pazician> The class animated was missing!
[08:17:20] <Pazician> Thank you guys!
[08:17:21] <taplar> the homepage for it even has working examples.  if you inspect the dom while one is running you can see the animate and other class being added an removed
[08:17:42] <shoky> just follow the super easy steps in the docs and you're good. as usual
[08:17:52] <taplar> ludicrus shoky
[08:17:57] <shoky> sry sry
[08:17:59] <Pazician> shoky: Right, I most have been a bit fast on that part
[08:46:49] <Pazician> I want when the user clicks on a question the answer should be visible and then when the user clicks again to close the answer the answer should remove and then add another class which is the fadeOutUp https://pastee.org/uce9p
[08:46:58] <Pazician> How can I do that?
[08:48:08] <kostodo> Can I do something like this: $("[id^=multicity-form-to].multicity-wrapper") ?
[08:48:20] <kostodo> i.e. match id but fixed class
[08:48:21] <kostodo> ?
[08:48:25] <taplar> Pazician: you should really consider binding on something other than document
[08:48:44] <Pazician> Yes, it was just an demostration
[08:48:50] <Pazician> I'll bind it to the question
[08:49:01] <taplar> kostodo: you can do that, however
[08:49:08] <kostodo> didn't work tho
[08:49:22] <taplar> $('[id^="multicity-form-to"].multicity-wrapper')
[08:49:30] <taplar> quote your matching strings
[08:49:36] <kostodo> aha
[08:49:37] <kostodo> thanks
[08:50:04] <taplar> and I might suggest changing it also
[08:50:32] <taplar> $('.multicity-wrapper').filter('[id^="multicity-form-to"]')
[08:51:11] <kostodo> can I chain filters?
[08:51:15] <taplar> yes
[08:51:44] <taplar> the point being if the lookup does the id matcher first, that's going to be a dom scan
[08:51:56] <taplar> not sure how sizzle processes requests like that
[08:52:09] <taplar> but the second one, will do something like get elements by class name, and then will filter
[08:52:10] <kostodo> taplar, ok cool. but its not grabbing what i want...
[08:52:16] <taplar> which is better performance
[08:52:24] <kostodo> $visible = $('.multicity-wrapper').filter('[id^="multicity-form-to"]').filter(function () { return $(this).is(":visible"); });
[08:53:06] <taplar> you can do filter(':visible')
[08:53:49] <taplar> so your looking for elements with class 'multicity-wrapper' who also have an id ending with "multicity-form-to", and are visible
[08:53:52] <kostodo> hehe oh
[08:53:59] <kostodo> yes
[08:54:14] <taplar> that looks correct then, syntax wise
[08:54:29] <taplar> oh wait
[08:54:31] <kostodo> its not grabbing them
[08:54:33] <taplar> ends with or begins with?
[08:54:47] <kostodo> begins with
[08:55:00] <taplar> ya, ok, that's right. i said ends with but you have begins with
[08:55:33] <taplar> what do you get with
[08:55:37] <taplar> console.log($('.multicity-wrapper').filter('[id^="multicity-form-to"]').length);
[08:58:14] <Mark____> can anyone help me with the jquery slider?
[08:59:30] <DirtyFin_> put your code to jsfiddle or codepen and we'll see if anyone is into that :)
[09:00:20] <Mark____> okay.
[09:01:40] * taplar feels left out without an underscore in his name
[09:02:01] <DirtyFin_> :)
[09:02:13] <kostodo> taplar, sorted that other issue mate thanks was doing something silly
[09:02:21] <taplar> cool
[09:03:19] <kostodo> taplar, i have another question tho. in an .each looping through my $visible array i want to check each one for input[name^=origin]
[09:03:34] <Mark____> DirtyFin_: can you take a look at this? https://jsfiddle.net/Ld58gpw7/
[09:03:36] <kostodo> if ( !$(this).filter('input[name^=origin]').val() )
[09:03:40] <kostodo> is that right?
[09:03:52] <Mark____> it gives you a basic idea of what im trying to tell you.
[09:03:53] <taplar> you want to know if they have that name?
[09:04:07] <DirtyFin_> looks nice
[09:04:08] <kostodo> no i want to check if the value of that input is empty
[09:04:12] <kostodo> or not
[09:04:13] <Mark____> yeah, it bascially
[09:04:15] <taplar> but only for those
[09:04:23] <Mark____> basically it contols the width of a div.
[09:04:37] <DirtyFin_> yes
[09:04:38] <kostodo> $(this) being the steps in $visible that we made before with the filters
[09:04:40] <Mark____> and if you would take a look at this: http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today#
[09:04:47] <Mark____> click on the cog button on the left side.
[09:04:55] <Mark____> and you will see the same slider on the very top of it.
[09:05:00] <taplar> kostodo: throw what your trying to do in a fiddle
[09:05:00] <Mark____> can you find it?
[09:05:08] <DirtyFin_> yes
[09:05:22] <kostodo> taplar, its hard to pull out the markup. its coming from Drupal... all over the place.
[09:05:31] <taplar> just the logic
[09:05:32] <Mark____> see how the width of the whole page gets adjusted as you move it left and right
[09:05:36] <Mark____> but the thing is that,
[09:05:40] <taplar> doesn't have to work
[09:05:52] <Mark____> the text inside of the slider won’t be centered.
[09:05:58] <taplar> i'm easy like that, :)
[09:06:03] <kostodo> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/
[09:06:03] <Mark____> i was wondering if you know anyway to fix this.
[09:06:32] <Mark____> $('.swiper-container').css('margin','0 auto',200); this should fix it, but it doesn’t.
[09:06:34] <kostodo> taplar, ignore the stuff inside the if
[09:06:45] <kostodo> taplar, its the condition im trying to get right
[09:06:46] <taplar> kostodo: ok, i would filter on visible before doing your each
[09:07:15] <kostodo> i cant though
[09:07:27] <kostodo> i need to loop through and set an error for each one
[09:07:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/1/
[09:07:50] <kostodo> ah i see what you mean
[09:08:01] <DirtyFin_> Mark____, the image with the text is centered  at pageload... I actually have a solution for this somewhere... let me find it
[09:08:19] <Mark____> hmm. okay tell me when you find it, cause this is weird.
[09:08:27] <kostodo> ah i see what you mean
[09:08:36] <Mark____> it should remain centered as you move around the slider
[09:08:46] <kostodo> taplar, so how do i access the values then? $(this).val()?
[09:08:48] <taplar> kostodo: that way your not checking every time.  you know they match
[09:08:56] <taplar> kostodo: yep, or simply this.value
[09:09:00] <taplar> not need to wrap
[09:09:04] <taplar> *no
[09:09:07] <kostodo> ok
[09:09:10] <kostodo> let me give that a shot
[09:10:35] <taplar> and side note, you might want to do a trim(), if that's in your use case
[09:10:43] <kostodo> taplar, so everything happening inside that each is only looking at whats inside the filtered results?
[09:10:50] <taplar> yep
[09:11:19] <kostodo> so something like that var target = will only grab the one its relevant to?
[09:11:19] <taplar> filter() returns a new jQuery object
[09:11:21] <DirtyFin_> Mark____, actually better than my solution would be if the slider changed the width of .main_title_2 too. now it just changes the width of .swiper-wrapper but the textimage is centered to .main_title_2
[09:11:36] <kostodo> gotcha
[09:11:42] <taplar> kostodo: you mean inside the each?
[09:11:44] <Mark____> i’ll try that but im afraid the result would be the same.
[09:11:46] <Mark____> but sec
[09:12:38] <Mark____> yeah it has the same problem after targeting .main_title_2
[09:14:18] <kostodo> taplar, hang on. I was looking for origins with no .val()
[09:14:26] <Mark____> maybe i should ask this on stackoverflow
[09:14:40] <taplar> kostodo: no value or a blank value?
[09:15:08] <Pazician> As I explained above, what am I doing? I want it to fadeOutUp when user clicks another question? https://pastee.org/qgcvz
[09:15:10] <taplar> meaning if they put in nothing but whitespace, is that also an error?
[09:15:29] <kostodo> yes
[09:16:14] <DirtyFin_> Mark____, you can do that
[09:16:29] <taplar> kostodo: https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/2/
[09:16:56] <DirtyFin_> but they'll too point out that the image is centered to its closest parent-div
[09:20:25] <kostodo> taplar, $visible is correct, but the event.preventDefault is not firing
[09:20:46] <kostodo> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/3/
[09:20:57] <kostodo> well nothing inside the each is firing
[09:21:41] <taplar> so a console.log doesn't print?
[09:22:33] <kostodo> bah
[09:22:36] <kostodo> think i found it one sec
[09:22:40] <kostodo> they were selects not inputs...
[09:22:45] <taplar> :)
[09:23:08] <kostodo> hmm still not fized sadly
[09:23:14] <kostodo> fixed*
[09:23:38] <taplar> so if you put a console log in the each does that print?
[09:24:08] <kostodo> yep i did. nothing prints.
[09:24:33] <taplar> ok, so lets break this up a bit
[09:24:40] <kostodo> does this.value.trim().length < 1;  work on select?
[09:24:53] <taplar> selects have a value so it should
[09:25:11] <kostodo> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/4/
[09:25:16] <kostodo> this is where its at
[09:27:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/5/
[09:27:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/6/ left a length off
[09:28:20] <taplar> heh, and i duplicated the filter, -_-
[09:28:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/7/
[09:29:20] <kostodo> prints 0 0 in console :(
[09:29:28] <taplar> hmm
[09:29:40] <taplar> so it's not finding your selects
[09:30:02] <kostodo> theyre there for sure
[09:30:05] <kostodo> one sec
[09:30:40] <taplar> now remember, filter() works on the existing result set
[09:30:52] <taplar> if your trying to reference children that would be find()
[09:31:15] <kostodo> not following
[09:31:17] <AlexRussia> how could I make a div clickable only if doesn't clicked nested clickable element, such as link or button?
[09:31:20] <kostodo> select is there for sure
[09:31:31] <kostodo> inside .multicity-wrapper
[09:31:39] <taplar> so is it a nested tag?
[09:31:43] <kostodo> ah wait
[09:31:53] <kostodo> it is on display=none
[09:32:02] <kostodo> would that be it?
[09:32:14] <taplar> display none would make :visible exclude it
[09:32:50] <kostodo> aha so the filter :visible is getting rid of all hidden elements in the selected dom
[09:32:55] <taplar> yep
[09:32:59] <kostodo> not just thos ein the same level as multicity-form-to
[09:33:07] <kostodo> even its children
[09:33:11] <kostodo> sheeeaaat
[09:33:13] <taplar> no, only of the result set
[09:33:34] <kostodo> wait, yes or no?
[09:33:37] <taplar> but right now your doing only filters()
[09:33:44] <taplar> so your not considering children
[09:34:01] <taplar> if you need children that is find()
[09:34:11] <kostodo> ok so the select is a child of .multicity-wrapper
[09:34:20] <kostodo> an its on display=none
[09:34:26] <kostodo> thats the DOM :)
[09:34:39] <taplar> $('.multicity-wrapper').filter('[id^="multicity-form-to"]').filter(":visible");
[09:35:06] <taplar> your selecting elements with class 'multicity-wrapper' who have an id starting with ''multicity-form-to" and are visible
[09:35:15] <taplar> $visible.filter('select[name^="origin"]');
[09:35:21] <kostodo> yeah get you
[09:35:35] <taplar> your then filtering out any of those elements that are not a select with a name starting with 'origin'
[09:36:01] <taplar> which is why i'm asking if they are children or not, or if indeed all these things are on single elements
[09:36:08] <kostodo> its aliveeeee
[09:36:09] <kostodo> :)
[09:36:22] <kostodo> switched to find for the selects
[09:36:25] <taplar> :)
[09:36:26] <kostodo> looking promising!
[09:36:33] <kostodo> let me just double check
[09:44:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/9/
[09:46:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4o72Ltq/10/ combine a selector

[09:48:26] * taplar is going to make a food run
[09:50:12] <Pazician> What am I doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/s4UyH/1167/ I want to fadeOutUp the element that has been clicked on and open the other one that will fadeInDown
[09:54:32] <slax0r> Pazician: in that fiddle, no jquery, so you have an error, and I guess we are also missing CSS?
[09:55:12] <Pazician> slax0r: Right, I won't redo all my work, I'm just asking if you guys seeing any kind of missing logic in the code
[10:04:14] <chrisml> how do you check to see if a plugin is loaded? if($.fn.fileupload) doesn't work
[10:05:55] <chrisml> i lied, it works
[10:25:51] <quangl> how do i set focus on an item with uuid='3'
[10:26:21] <taplar> not familiar with that attribute
[10:27:15] <taplar> context?
[10:29:23] <Xatenev> Anybody familiar with jquery draggable?
[10:30:58] <taplar> just ask your q man
[10:33:30] <Xatenev> Well basically im trying to move element X when i click on element Y
[10:33:35] <Xatenev> (When I drag element Y)
[10:33:47] <Xatenev> Problem is right now I can just move element X when i click on element X
[10:33:50] <Xatenev> and I dont see how I can change that..
[10:35:18] <quangl> me?
[10:35:30] <decx> use the drag event to translate x Xatenev
[10:35:32] <quangl> well i have an object with a unique property called uuid
[10:35:36] <quangl> how do i focus on it?
[10:35:54] <Xatenev> decx: any link?
[10:36:06] <decx> no
[10:36:15] <taplar> quangl: can you provide context?  that doesn't seem like a standard attribute, and your saying 'object' which is obscure
[10:36:25] <Xatenev> dunno how to do it then xd
[10:36:27] <Xatenev> shit
[10:38:30] <quangl> well i am adding items to angular-gridster
[10:38:42] <quangl> and in my array of objects there is a property called uuid
[10:39:20] <taplar> they are objects, not dom elements?
[10:39:47] <quangl> they are dom elements
[10:39:53] <quangl> or
[10:39:54] <quangl> wait
[10:39:56] <quangl> they are objects
[10:40:06] <taplar> there's a difference, which is it?
[10:40:26] <taplar> you can't focus on objects.
[10:41:33] <quangl> ok
[10:41:47] <quangl> well how do i focus on an item with a title="my title"
[10:42:44] <taplar> if it's a dom element on the page you can just do .focus() on it
[10:42:57] <taplar> if you need to look it up, that entirely depends on how you have it stored
[10:43:22] <quangl> i need to look it up by title
[10:43:27] <quangl> how do i select by title?
[10:43:35] <taplar> you don't want to do that, you want to look up by something else and filter on title
[10:44:25] <quangl> what?
[10:44:29] <quangl> do u mean
[10:44:34] <quangl> h3 with title?
[10:44:40] <taplar> there is not a direct way to do that
[10:44:55] <taplar> id, tagname, class, they all have underlying methods for finding them
[10:44:59] <taplar> other attributes don't
[10:45:09] <taplar> meaning any lookup involving just them is going to have to check everything
[10:45:11] <taplar> which is expensive
[10:45:28] <taplar> so you want to look up by something that is not expensive to reduce the result set you need to check for your attribute
[10:46:01] <taplar> such as if it was an h3 that had the title
[10:46:16] <taplar> $('h3').filter('[title="whatever"]')
[10:46:17] <quangl> h3 that has a title but i need to trim it
[10:46:34] <quangl> i mean remove leading and trailing whitespace
[10:47:15] <taplar> $('h3').filter(function(){ return $(this).attr('title').trim() === "whatever"; })
[10:47:44] <quangl> well can i just do h3 that contains text?
[10:48:05] <taplar> like what?  you've been saying title
[10:48:50] <taplar> $('h3').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf("whatever") > -1; })
[10:48:50] <quangl> well actually there is a span inside a h3 that is the title
[10:48:54] <quangl> but its actually text
[10:49:04] <quangl> in a span
[10:49:57] <taplar> $('h3 span').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf("whatever") > -1; })
[10:50:15] <decx> you can use .trim() ... to trim
[10:50:34] <quangl> well i do this
[10:50:35] <quangl> $('h3').filter(function(){ return this.innerHTML.indexOf("Intersection controller - status : Pryor St @ Andrew Young Intl Bl") > -1;}).focus()
[10:50:47] <quangl> but that doesnt seem to work when i type it in the console
[10:51:40] <taplar> console.log your selector.length and make sure it's matching
[10:53:02] <decx> also your h3 needs a tabindex so focus even does anything
[10:53:11] <taplar> oh, true
[10:53:17] <taplar> h3 really aren't focusable
[10:53:25] <decx> well they are nowadays
[10:53:28] <decx> IF you have the tabindex
[10:53:31] <taplar> really?  that's weird
[10:53:59] <quangl> can i focus on span?
[10:54:26] <taplar> heh, decx may can tell you about that.  i'm only familiar with inputs being focusable
[10:55:04] <decx> no idea if it's canon but browsers do it for tabindexed elements
[10:56:01] <decx> demo https://jsfiddle.net/qcqrjmka/
[10:58:00] <taplar> pretty cool
[10:58:16] <quangl> well how do i focus on a span?
[10:58:46] <NoiseEee> quangl: i give up... what would such a thing "do" ?
[10:58:55] <NoiseEee> what does it mean to focus on a span?
[10:59:17] <quangl> so that in gridster the webpage would scroll to it
[10:59:31] <decx> that's not how that works
[10:59:33] <quangl> well i need the webpage to scroll to the recently added item
[10:59:37] <quangl> damn it
[10:59:53] <decx> you have to actually scroll the window there yourself
[11:00:12] <decx> by giving scrollTop or whatever you want to use the newly added elements offset

[11:16:42] <HeatherMc> hello, how can you hide a class, if you find certain text appear in a page
[11:16:45] <HeatherMc> like this:  https://jsfiddle.net/fpmjdm6s/
[11:17:18] <HeatherMc> if i find this link in the page, https://global.gotowebinar.com/join/, then i want to hide the thanks class/id
[11:17:21] <taplar> i don't see a class in that html
[11:17:21] <HeatherMc> div
[11:18:23] <HeatherMc> sorry not a class
[11:18:27] <HeatherMc> i meant a div/id
[11:18:36] <taplar> is that url a link or is it just text?
[11:18:53] <HeatherMc> just text, but could have other stuff after the word join
[11:18:57] <taplar> ugh
[11:19:05] <HeatherMc> but that would always be the same pattern match
[11:19:10] <taplar> is it contained an any outer element
[11:19:33] <taplar> *in
[11:19:41] <HeatherMc> but it would be wrapped in <div class="joinURLBox">https://global.gotowebinar.com/join/1579303689546766082/143617998         </div>
[11:19:50] <taplar> better
[11:21:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fpmjdm6s/2/
[11:22:59] <HeatherMc> very cool, thanks
[11:41:13] <Pazician> How can I make this, when I click on the same question I close the answer? https://pastee.org/hp259
[11:41:31] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[11:41:34] <duch_kazatel> and $(".question").on("click", function() { nonono
[11:41:39] <duch_kazatel> don't put that in your event handler.
[11:41:53] <duch_kazatel> every time you click on .question you're binding another listener.
[11:42:02] <Pazician> Why nonono?
[11:42:11] <duch_kazatel> i just explained.
[11:42:20] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle and show your html.
[11:45:04] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/v851be10/
[11:45:21] <duch_kazatel> so do you see the issue with the nested event listenerS?
[11:45:40] <Pazician> No, not really?
[11:46:02] <bmuk> Hey everyone, I have a table with some usernames and email addresses in it. I would like to make these rows selectable and hold the selected values in a list to be pushed into a different form when the user presses a button. Not sure how to go about googling for this or starting to implement it. Any help would be awesome
[11:46:47] <duch_kazatel> Pazician every time you run the handler bound with $(document).on("click", ".question", function() {, you're also binding another $(".question").on("click", function() {.
[11:47:00] <duch_kazatel> so every time you click on question, you bind another listener to question.
[11:47:11] <duch_kazatel> which means you could have that code run 2, 3, 10, etc times.
[11:47:32] <Pazician> Oh, I got it
[11:47:40] <duch_kazatel> Pazician so what are yout rying to accomnplish?
[11:47:44] <duch_kazatel> you click on a .question and then what?
[11:48:18] <Pazician> When the user clicks the same question (there's more than one on the site) it should close the answer, no it's only closing when the user clicks another question
[11:48:28] <duch_kazatel> Pazician update your html then to be a better example.
[11:48:54] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/v851be10/2/
[11:49:05] <duch_kazatel> Pazician on.
[11:49:06] <duch_kazatel> *oh.
[11:49:12] <duch_kazatel> ae you able to modify the html?
[11:49:24] <Pazician> No, not really since it's added from WP
[11:49:34] <duch_kazatel> yuck
[11:49:37] <duch_kazatel> then you can't use .parent()
[11:50:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to use $(this).next();
[11:50:10] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/next/
[11:50:59] <Pazician> Hmm, so instead of .parent() I should use .next()?
[11:51:24] <duch_kazatel> .parent() goes to a parent.
[11:51:33] <Pazician> Yes, that's what it should do
[11:51:33] <duch_kazatel> all of these question/answer nodes have the same parent.
[11:51:48] <duch_kazatel> i think you're confused about what "parent" means.
[11:52:43] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/v851be10/3/
[11:52:47] <Pazician> Alright, so like this?
[11:52:50] <Pazician> And it's working
[11:52:56] <duch_kazatel> again.
[11:53:04] <duch_kazatel> you still have that .on() inside an .on()
[11:53:31] <Pazician> So I should remove that, but then it'll not close the current one if I click on the next one?
[11:53:41] <duch_kazatel> slow down.
[11:53:50] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:54:21] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v851be10/5/ this is all you need.
[11:55:08] <Pazician> Right, it's working but when I click another one I want the showing one to close
[11:55:22] <duch_kazatel> easy
[11:55:31] <duch_kazatel> find all .toggle-active and remove that class.
[11:55:55] <Pazician> Then the open one will not show up, right?
[11:56:07] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v851be10/7/
[11:56:28] <duch_kazatel> this is why you don't use toggleClass()
[11:57:39] <taplar> little strange that after clicking one you only show one, but it starts off showing all...
[11:57:56] * duch_kazatel that's the way the code seems to be written.
[11:57:59] <duch_kazatel> easy enough to swap around.
[11:58:04] <duch_kazatel> just fix the html ;)
[11:58:11] <duch_kazatel> or invert the logic.
[11:58:15] <taplar> yeah, just wasn't sure if that was intentional
[11:58:19] <Pazician> Oh, yeah - but it still doesn't close the current one
[11:58:33] <duch_kazatel> then you need secondary logic to see if the "current" one is active or not.
[12:00:17] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/v851be10/8/
[12:00:24] <Pazician> This will not open anything
[12:00:42] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/v851be10/9/
[12:00:48] <taplar> check your console
[12:02:13] <Pazician> Right, corrected it - but same thing happens, I can't close the current one
[12:03:20] <taplar> well, as it is, after line 2 you've lost the context of if it was already open or not
[12:03:45] <Pazician> So basically I should just move it to the top?
[12:04:09] <taplar> *shrug* play around a bit, :)
[12:04:26] <Pazician> Hmm... Didn't do the thing. I'll try, thank you for all your help :)
[12:04:58] <Pazician> Would you mind to give me a hint maybe, hehe
[12:05:06] <taplar> it can help two write out in (insert native language) the logical conditionals your trying to do and what should happen for each
[12:05:23] <taplar> then it's just a matter of writing that in js
[12:07:20] <duch_kazatel> weee meetings.

[12:48:04] <akkufomk> What's with the splitz
[12:48:12] <akkufomk> I'm trying to work here ;)
[12:51:25] <taplar_lunch> hmm?
[13:20:05] <taplar> heh
[13:43:06] <clevodearia> I have a web page with two child elements in <body>, #one and #two. In #one, all the inner content is directly from the html file I manually wrote. in #two, using jQuery it is populated identically to #one.
[13:44:17] <clevodearia> Working with this code: http://dpaste.com/14PJ7S6 I'm trying to detect when any element in #one is hovered upon, so that I can activate the class "hovered" for the correpsonding element that exists in #two.
[13:44:31] <clevodearia> I'm doing it wrong.
[13:45:35] <duch_kazatel> use a delegated listener.
[13:46:13] <duch_kazatel> $('#one').on('mouseenter', 'theChild', function() { $(this).addClass('hovered'); });
[13:46:47] <duch_kazatel> use removeClass for mouseleave
[13:47:20] <clevodearia> duch_kazatel, Isn't that necessary only if content changes in #one? That isn't the case. Only #two content is changed.
[13:49:05] <clevodearia> I don't want to add classes to anything in #one, but I want to detect when hovering over anything in #one, and duplicate the hover effect to apply to the corresponding element in #two, by toggling a class for enabled
[13:49:09] <clevodearia> or hovered*
[13:49:39] <taplar> how are you tieing them together?
[13:49:56] <clevodearia> You can see it in action at http://nullvoid.org/jason.khanlar/
[13:50:07] <taplar> or you could tell me
[13:50:33] <clevodearia> hmmm
[13:51:17] <nullp0inter> i have a blob thats being sent through filesaver.js...i want to do some string replaces in there. so far ive got filereader working to do my replaces, but how do i overwrite the blob thats in a variable?
[13:51:54] <clevodearia> I am tying them together such that when hovering over an element, the duplicated corresponding element should appear hovered as well.
[13:51:58] <clevodearia> Does that make sense?
[13:52:03] <taplar> no
[13:52:06] <clevodearia> hmm
[13:52:14] <clevodearia> I'm not sure how to answer the question or if I understand what you mean.
[13:52:22] <taplar> you have a #one X that you are relating to a #two X
[13:52:24] <taplar> yes?
[13:52:27] <clevodearia> yes
[13:52:32] <taplar> how do you relate the X's?
[13:52:51] <taplar> ids?  classes?  data elements?
[13:53:33] <clevodearia> In most cases, there are no unique ids or classes to distinguish.
[13:53:53] <taplar> lol, so how do you know when you hover over one child which one in the other to target?
[13:53:53] <clevodearia> Many are <a> elements with no uniquely identifying attributes
[13:54:15] <clevodearia> I was hoping that this var would relate somehow
[13:54:38] <taplar> if you don't have some way to tie them together, all your left with is positioning, which is very fragile
[13:54:50] <taplar> you need something on them that is relational
[13:55:12] <clevodearia> or maybe to expand the $("#one *") to be prepopulated with a full hierarchy such that I can translate it, or replace "#one" with "#two"
[14:04:26] <duch_kazatel> clevodearia make a jsfiddle of your problem.
[14:04:37] <duch_kazatel> like, simplify the question down to the basics.

[16:49:33] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, does anyone know how I can stop jQuery UI Draggable from updating left/top in the "drag" event? I am using MVVM and am automatically updating those values via an observable-variable. Alternatively, maybe there's a way of overriding the left/top that jQuery uses? Because both "fight each other". Thanks for any pointers! :-)
[16:52:26] <duch_kazatel> what do you want it to do instead?
[16:52:37] <duch_kazatel> like, that's part of what it does so i'm lost.
[16:59:00] <JD-Robbs> Well, the thing is - rather than draggable changing left/right - I am storing the position in an observable variable. The ViewModel is in charge of the data that is to be reflected in the UI. Currently, it is updated twice and that laggs a little. :(
[16:59:20] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you might need to rethink your approach then :)
[16:59:41] <duch_kazatel> could always debounce or throttle the updates.
[17:08:03] <JD-Robbs> I think you're right there. Because it's seriously messing with draggable. :(
[17:08:17] <JD-Robbs> Good idea! I'll give throttling a go!
[17:08:23] <JD-Robbs> Thanks :)
[17:08:30] <duch_kazatel> or debounce.  you don't need things to live update like that imo.
[17:11:16] <JD-Robbs> Crappsy! I have found one more source of my headaches! Resizable changes height/width and (obviously, duuuhhh) left/top if you're re-sizing from the west.
[17:11:22] <JD-Robbs> Heureka
[17:12:03] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to rethink your approach.
[17:17:01] <taplar> iirc i tried using draggable and resizable together in the past.  didn't play well together
[17:44:17] <z1haze> is there a way to say when I click a 'edit' link and I want to show/hide some elements, that I can only show hide the elements in this particular post? Im trying to show an edit form on my forum replies page.. there are man replies and when I change the css it seems to change the css for every reply
[17:44:34] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[17:44:49] <duch_kazatel> you use $(this) and traverse from there.
[17:45:54] <z1haze> well the div stuff i want to modify is after after the link
[17:46:09] <z1haze> i have tried $(this).closest('.edit-form').show(); but nothing happens now
[17:46:19] <duch_kazatel> because that's not what .closest() does :)
[17:46:22] <duch_kazatel> it goes "up"
[17:46:29] <duch_kazatel> to the first ancestor that matches that selector.
[17:46:59] <z1haze> dang
[17:46:59] <duch_kazatel> use .closest() to get to the parent element of the current post and then use .find() to get your .edit-form
[17:47:09] <z1haze> does find() only get a single element though?
[17:47:13] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:47:16] <duch_kazatel> it gets everything that matches.
[17:47:21] <z1haze> guess im screwed then
[17:47:25] <duch_kazatel> why?
[17:47:34] <z1haze> well find will just bring me back to where i started
[17:47:44] <z1haze> it will change all of the elements on the page matching the class
[17:47:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:47:55] <duch_kazatel> you should have a single element around each post.
[17:48:00] <duch_kazatel> is this not the case?
[17:48:05] <z1haze> i do, yes
[17:48:10] <z1haze> a wrapper
[17:48:12] <duch_kazatel> then you get to that element and go from there.
[17:48:17] <duch_kazatel> no problem.
[17:48:57] <z1haze> so like $(this).closest('.post').find('my-div.).hide() ?
[17:49:02] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:49:05] <z1haze> alright thank you
[17:49:19] <duch_kazatel> and store  $(this).closest('.post') in a var so you can reuse it for other things, too.
[17:49:57] <z1haze> ok cool
[17:50:04] <Heath_> How would i only show the date and time here, and not the other things
[17:50:04] <Heath_> https://jsfiddle.net/gubumbqs/1/
[17:50:18] <z1haze> so i can do var el = $(this).closest('.post');
[17:50:18] <z1haze>         el.find('edit-form').show(); ?
[17:50:24] <duch_kazatel> z1haze yep.
[17:50:28] <z1haze> sweet
[17:50:31] <duch_kazatel> Heath_ can you control the markup at all?
[17:51:28] <Heath_> i don't control it
[17:51:36] <Heath_> auto generates from a CMS
[17:51:40] <duch_kazatel> yuck.
[17:51:40] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[17:51:49] <Heath_> seems like the <P>'s are consistent though
[17:51:54] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:52:03] <duch_kazatel> get the text by using .text() and then trim the string nad see if it starts with something.
[17:52:27] <duch_kazatel> though that's not guaranteed, should get you close enough to start.
[17:54:14] <Heath_> is there a way to only show the first 2 <p>
[17:54:17] <Heath_> in that div
[17:54:32] <duch_kazatel> sure - use .each() and see what the .index() of each is.
[17:54:48] <duch_kazatel> though i'd be careful with that approach too since the CMS could change things out from under you.
[17:55:26] <Heath_> or $("selector").slice(from, to)
[17:55:39] <duch_kazatel> i'm personally not a fan of doing things like that, but sure.
[17:56:30] <jphase> or just in the selector itself :\
[17:56:43] <duch_kazatel> i would avoid using the custom selector extensions.
[17:56:58] <duch_kazatel> they're slow and really hard to read.
[17:57:02] <jphase> I jumped in a little late - perhaps I misunderstood grabbing the first 2 <p> tags
[17:57:22] <duch_kazatel> they don't really care if it's the first two, they care about the contents of them.
[17:57:29] <jphase> ohh nvm
[17:57:32] * jphase hides
[17:57:42] <duch_kazatel> but they're assuming they always want to show the first two, so there are a billion ways to accomplish what they want :)
[17:58:04] <jphase> I think we should all fight each other about different appraoches
[17:58:09] * jphase is bored
[17:58:14] <duch_kazatel> no more first.
[17:58:16] <duch_kazatel> *fights
[17:58:29] <jphase> hah, rough day in #jquery today? I was idle most of the day
[17:58:44] <duch_kazatel> nah, just sick of people looking for arguments to have lately.
[17:58:52] <duch_kazatel> i left a few channels recently because of that  kind of stuff.
[18:04:24] <arc_> it's crazy the percentage of problems in here deal with people having to shoehorn something in on top of a cms, but i guess that just shows what a pain in the ass that is compared to the alternatives
[18:04:49] <arc_> that deal*
[18:04:51] <duch_kazatel> i'm always surprised people stick with inflexible solutions for so long, especially when they're early in a project.
[18:06:52] <Heath_> how would i make this work with the div id
[18:06:52] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/69/
[18:07:05] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do there?
[18:07:32] <duch_kazatel> also, . is for classes.
[18:07:35] <duch_kazatel> # is for IDs
[18:07:56] <Heath_> i am just trying to only reference the a's inside that id
[18:08:00] <Heath_> div/id
[18:08:03] <Heath_> not the ouster one
[18:08:08] <Heath_> out'r
[18:08:08] <duch_kazatel> right, so you need to use #, not .
[18:08:10] <duch_kazatel> #id
[18:08:23] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/70/
[18:08:26] <Heath_> doesn't seem to work
[18:08:29] <arc_> and so also, a needs to be just 'a' not '.a'
[18:08:43] <duch_kazatel> you need a space.
[18:08:47] <duch_kazatel> not .
[18:08:50] <Heath_> ok cool
[18:08:51] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/71/
[18:08:53] <duch_kazatel> #id element
[18:34:36] <jak2000> hi all
[18:35:04] <jak2000> wich other event similar to change event exist? sometims in a select/option dont fire the change event....
[18:35:27] <duch_kazatel> they always fire change when things change.
[18:35:34] <Heath_> how can i remove a comma from inside of a div
[18:35:34] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/72/
[18:35:41] <duch_kazatel> .replace.
[18:35:56] <duch_kazatel> need to set the text of the div to a version where you used .replace() to remove the comma.
[18:38:14] <Heath_> doesn't seem to work
[18:38:14] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/73/
[18:38:25] <duch_kazatel> .val() is for inputs.
[18:38:28] <duch_kazatel> you want .text()
[18:39:26] <Heath_> cool beans, thanks   http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/74/
[18:39:40] <duch_kazatel> there's learn.jquery.com fwiw.
[18:39:45] <duch_kazatel> might be good for you to run through.
[18:46:42] <Heath_> will check it out over the weekend
[18:47:23] <Heath_> is there a way to get the values of the first two p's inside this div, and then make that div a display:none, and then write the values of the two p's
[18:47:24] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/75/
[18:47:32] <Heath_> all the other ways, are not working for me
[18:47:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:48:01] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[18:48:03] <Heath_> write/show the values of the p's to the screen after i hide (display:none) that div
[18:48:18] <duch_kazatel> back up and try again.
[18:48:39] <Heath_> i really just want to extract what's in between the first 2 sets of <p> tags
[18:48:49] <Heath_> and don't want to display anything else
[18:49:12] <Heath_> personally would rather just do a display:none on that div, after i extracted the values of those p tags
[18:49:35] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean "extracted the values of those p tags"
[18:49:40] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with anything?
[18:49:49] <Heath_> i want the screen to say
[18:49:52] <Heath_> aaa
[18:49:53] <Heath_> bbb
[18:49:54] <Heath_> only
[18:50:59] <duch_kazatel> why didn't your slice() trick work for you?
[18:51:11] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/76/
[18:51:18] <Heath_> because there is so much going on in that div
[18:51:32] <Heath_> i was talking about, before and after the stuff i wanted
[18:51:39] <duch_kazatel> okay, this is much clearer.
[18:52:13] <duch_kazatel> select the two p tags, make a new div, slap them in there, and then hide this divc.
[18:52:15] <duch_kazatel> *diov
[18:52:20] <duch_kazatel> **div i cannot type today.
[18:52:28] <Heath_> that's what i want to do
[18:52:33] <Heath_> the question is how
[18:52:36] <Heath_> i am very new to this world
[18:52:43] <Heath_> of jquery
[18:52:43] <duch_kazatel> where are you stuck in that?
[18:52:47] <duch_kazatel> you know how to select elements.
[18:54:53] <Heath_> not really
[18:54:54] <Heath_> $("newvar1") = $("p:first")
[18:54:59] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:54:59] <Heath_> would be my gut instinct
[18:55:04] <Heath_> but then i have to google it like crazy
[18:55:05] <duch_kazatel> you had it right earlier.
[18:55:13] <Heath_> and dig through the madness of stack overflows
[18:55:15] <Heath_> 8-)
[18:55:19] <duch_kazatel> you used .slice()
[18:55:22] <duch_kazatel> why not use it again here?
[18:56:59] <Heath_> $('newvar1').$("#event p").slice(1).text;
[18:57:04] <duch_kazatel> err.
[18:57:05] <duch_kazatel> nop.
[18:57:13] <duch_kazatel> that tutorial would be really handy though :)
[18:57:22] <Heath_> HAHHA TRU DAT
[18:57:47] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:57:56] <duch_kazatel> either way, $('#eventDetails').children('p').slice(0, 2)
[18:58:02] <duch_kazatel> that's probably where you want to start.
[18:59:09] <duch_kazatel> that'll get you the first two elements in a collection.
[18:59:26] <duch_kazatel> then you just need to learn how to add a new element and append to it.
[19:02:45] <Heath_> $("#eventDetails p").slice(1).text.appendTo($('#someotherdivbefore-eventDetails'));;
[19:02:56] <duch_kazatel> that's not what you want.
[19:03:02] <duch_kazatel> you need to pass 2 args to slice.
[19:03:27] <duch_kazatel> and your selector will get ALL <p> tags that are children of that div - there might be ones nested under other elements that you don't want.
[19:03:33] <duch_kazatel> hence the suggestion you use .children()
[19:05:19] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/78/
[19:05:22] <Heath_> yah that doesn't work
[19:05:38] <duch_kazatel> you then have to hide the old element.
[19:05:59] <duch_kazatel> it's actually working fine otherwise.
[19:06:02] <duch_kazatel> the elements are being moved.
[19:08:17] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/PrFRP/79/
[19:08:24] <Heath_> oh, then this was a ewaste
[19:08:26] <Heath_> of a try
[19:08:28] <duch_kazatel> ...
[19:08:42] <duch_kazatel> what you had was fine, just needed to also hide the old container.
[19:09:22] <Heath_> ahh ok
[20:14:44] <jen_> I have a wordpress page that I’d like to embed on a page with a different domain.  Can AJAX for this?
[21:09:55] <wa5ted> any one familiar with the plugin zoomooz
[21:10:03] <wa5ted> http://jaukia.github.io/zoomooz/
[21:10:14] <wa5ted> i need some help with the previous and next buttons
[21:10:54] <wa5ted> i keep getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[21:57:51] <wa5ted> anyone know any good plugins for transforming a div
[21:57:57] <wa5ted> with a ui based approach
[22:03:07] <Lencl> hmm
[22:03:18] <Lencl> I'm trying to debug an I.E. jquery issue
[22:03:39] <Lencl> basically, I have an ajax request, but I.E. doesn't even show the request is being sent, let alone give an error
[22:03:45] <Lencl> yet firefox and chrome show it
[22:09:22] <arc_> what version of ie
[22:09:47] <arc_> iirc, chrome and firefox are more forgiving of minor syntax errors than ie. i could just be making that up though
[22:25:17] <Lencl> it's I.E 11
[22:32:22] <Lencl_> arc_, turns out ajax doesn't like when url is set to ''
[22:32:39] <Lencl_> when I leave it empty, firefox and chrome know it means the current page.
[22:50:01] <hellyeah> hey
[22:52:43] <hellyeah> heyDoy uknow about this?
