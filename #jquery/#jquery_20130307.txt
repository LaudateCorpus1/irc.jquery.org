[00:03:57] <milligan> Cork, sorry for bothering. Just read the API and saw what to do now ;)
[00:15:13] <MACscr> need a bit of help figuring out a solution for my problem. Im using the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/YehpW/11/ and when you click on a menu item like "Connect", it should show a sub menu. The problem is that this menu has nested menu's as well that for the point of this mobile menu, will be treated as a single sub menu. Anyway, while slidedown() works for the immediate UL after $this, the n
[00:15:13] <MACscr> ested UL's are still set to display:none; Should I be using a mix of next() and children()? I really I am going about this design in entirely the wrong way, but im limited a bit on my options since the menu is responsive.
[00:15:21] <MACscr> any suggestions are welcomed
[00:20:45] <fat> how do i make the background color transparent (not block background) and make the fireworks have a high opacity http://jsfiddle.net/AceJJ/60/
[00:22:14] <Cork> fat: the back is in the canvas
[00:22:18] <Cork> so the script sets that color
[00:22:32] <fat> cork: so i can't change it?
[00:22:38] <Cork> sure you can
[00:22:43] <Cork> but not through css
[00:25:06] <fat> cork: howww?
[00:25:33] <Cork> can't answer that without dissecting the script
[00:25:48] <Cork> but it is setting the background-color of the canvas
[00:26:59] <Eviltwin> Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/cTPa4/
[00:27:23] <fat> eviltwin: NIICE THAT LOOKS great
[00:27:43] <fat> cheers
[00:27:46] <DukeDrake> wow o.o
[00:27:59] <DukeDrake> colorrs XD
[00:28:41] <msoa> Can anyone  mention for me several ajaxError() event property? (like setting.url)
[00:29:34] <Cork> msoa: uh, what are you asking exactly?
[00:31:43] <msoa> wait . . .
[00:37:22] <qwebirc76340> hi all, want to ask how do i remove attribute with jquery.attr()? can i do this $(element).attr('data-attribute="" ') ?
[00:37:42] <Cork> ?.removeAttr @ qwebirc76340
[00:37:48] <msoa> i want some attributes that ajaxError event object give me. ok?
[00:37:48] <msoa> I want know about some attributes that $.ajaxError(event) give me? (is about event parameter) ok?
[00:37:54] <Cork> aaand the bot is gone
[00:38:04] <Cork> `.remoteAttr
[00:38:12] <qwebirc76340> cork but .removeattr doesnt work in ie6-8 according to docs
[00:38:15] <msoa> Correct Question: I want know about some attributes that $.ajaxError(event) give me? (is about event parameter) ok?
[00:38:47] <Cork> qwebirc76340: read again
[00:39:36] <Cork> msoa: you want to inspect a return value?
[00:39:40] <Cork> or...?
[00:40:14] <msoa> yes. like event.someattributes
[00:40:32] <Cork> just console.log(object) the object and inspect it
[00:41:13] <msoa> i retturn
[00:42:47] <msoa1> Cork: I do it. but information is greate . i want som example.
[00:42:56] <qwebirc76340> cork my bad... its for inline element ya --> Note: Removing an inline onclick event handler using .removeAttr() doesn't achieve the desired effect in Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8. To avoid potential problems, use .prop() instead:
[00:43:13] <Cork> qwebirc76340: no the comment is for event attributes
[00:43:36] <Cork> and yes, event attributes has lots of problems if they are used
[00:43:56] <qwebirc76340> cork ah ok got it thx a lot
[00:44:31] <qwebirc76340> cork english is not my native lang, so smtimes its really hard to really understand what it means, especially coding lang
[00:45:07] <Cork> qwebirc76340: the document is about when you write ex. <a onclick="alert('bad')"></a>
[00:45:29] <Cork> or onmousemove or...
[00:46:03] <msoa1> Cork: i want only some example for documenting own attricle. help me?
[00:46:23] <Cork> msoa1: i would if i could understand your question
[00:46:30] <qwebirc76340> cork yes i got it, thx a lot
[00:48:26] <msoa1> Thanks, my Internet connection will crash. excuseme!
[00:48:45] <Cork> O_o'
[00:48:54] <Cork> you know your connection will crash??
[00:58:26] <fabioportieri> hi
[00:58:30] <fabioportieri> Note: Since jQuery 1.8, .success, .error and .complete are deprecated in favor of .done, .fail and .always.
[00:58:34] <fabioportieri> why so?
[00:58:47] <fabioportieri> regarding to ajax request
[00:59:03] <Cork> fabioportieri: cause deferred uses done, fail and always
[00:59:27] <Cork> success, error and complete was just pointers to those functions
[01:00:11] <fabioportieri> ah ok
[01:01:36] <fabioportieri> deferred is used to make scripts sync togheter right?
[01:02:01] <Cork> its a way to define callbacks as dasy-chained functions
[01:02:37] <Cork> $.ajax({ success: function() {} }) vs $.ajax().success(function() {})
[01:03:05] <fabioportieri> ? the first form is deprecated too?
[01:03:13] <Cork> no
[01:03:17] <fabioportieri> ahok
[01:03:26] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[01:03:40] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[01:04:57] <fabioportieri> interesting
[01:05:26] <Trudko> Guys I took html from dropdown and it contains some empty text nodes which should not be here. How to remove those?
[01:06:16] <LekeFly> can a plugin like scrollTo expand the viewport on scroll?
[01:10:54] <Cork> LekeFly: expand the viewport, no
[01:11:08] <Cork> that would imply access to the window sizes
[01:12:14] <LekeFly> So it would need to solve it with some css then.. i guess
[01:12:40] <Cork> are you sure your talking about viewport and not offset parent overflow parent?
[01:13:00] <Cork> viewport is the browser window, not an element you have access to
[01:14:03] <seutje> unless u opened it, no?
[01:14:10] <seutje> ?g mdn resizeTo
[01:14:11] <b-ot> seutje: window.resizeTo - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.resizeTo
[01:14:34] <Cork> seutje: depending on if the preferences in the browser is set to allow that ya
[01:14:57] <glosoli> hello, anyone could tell me which css files are required by jQuery Slider element
[01:14:58] <glosoli>  ?
[01:15:05] <seutje> yeah, won't get it to consistently work
[01:15:14] <Cork> glosoli: core and theme
[01:15:23] <Cork> i think there is one for slider too
[01:15:45] <glosoli> Cork: well yes there is one for slider which while being standalone doesn't take any effect
[01:16:03] <Cork> glosoli: ya it depends on the core css file
[01:16:29] <LekeFly> Cork: i need to scroll horizontal.. to a place that doesn't exist hehe
[01:16:30] <glosoli> Cork: but core and slider doesn't seem to be enough too
[01:17:03] <Cork> glosoli: look in the core.css i think it does imports if i remember correctly
[01:17:22] <glosoli> Cork: nah core doesn't, as it will output errors in console log
[01:17:33] <glosoli> base does
[01:17:34] <LekeFly> Cork: Was just thinking of adding a class to the css that has something like width: 2000px then use scrollTo to scroll to the right
[01:17:36] <glosoli> but base imports everything
[01:18:16] <Cork> glosoli: well slider needs the widget and the like, and i think those are in the core
[01:18:23] <Cork> that should be all thats needed
[01:18:35] <Cork> (excpt for a theme that is)
[01:21:18] <glosoli> Cork: for you it work with just widget, core and slider css ?
[01:22:02] <Cork> it was quite some time since i did a limited css for slider
[01:22:16] <Cork> but just add the widget to a page and look at what classes it references
[01:22:23] <Cork> then copy those, and your set
[01:23:57] <glosoli> well I was wrong widget doesn't even seem to provide separate css or smth
[01:27:43] <nathanbz> anyone know a good way of putting excepted text in a text field, eg foe a date field having the background dd-mm-YYYY
[01:28:06] <nathanbz> I was trying to think of what to google but nothing comes up with what I want :)
[01:28:26] <Cork> nathanbz: you mean like having a mask to the field?
[01:28:54] <LekeFly> Any reason this code should not work? http://pastebin.com/TmhdPHea
[01:29:28] <nathanbz> umm so before they click into the box it has dd-mm-YYYY
[01:29:32] <nathanbz> when they click in it clears
[01:29:58] <nathanbz> I know how to do this but if there was a plugin or something for it for compatability reasons
[01:30:05] <Cork> nathanbz: <input type="date" placeholder="dd-mm-YYYY">
[01:30:37] <Cork> and ya you need a fallback plugin for ie
[01:30:57] <limpc> how do you do a multiple-value selector?
[01:31:12] <Cork> $('val1, val2, val3')
[01:31:43] <nathanbz> thanks cork :)
[01:31:53] <nathanbz> need to learn more html5s :)
[01:32:09] <Cork> its just html
[01:32:18] <Cork> html5 is just a buzz word
[01:32:25] <Cork> doesn't mean anything
[01:32:45] <limpc> hmm so, suppose i have an attribute defined as: data-type="val-id other-id tri-id quad-id" and i want to find all elements with a data-type of "tri-id" and "quad-id" I just do $("li[data-type~=tri-id,quad-id]")?
[01:32:58] <Cork> well if anything, it means "something new a cool"
[01:33:22] <limpc> html5 introduces some non-standard html features though, like workers and native video encoding
[01:33:44] <Cork> limpc: no html means the new living html standard
[01:33:52] <Cork> it constantly evolves, and adds new things
[01:34:08] <Cork> html5 was termed to give marketing a buzz word
[01:34:13] <limpc> technically everything is a living standard.  except maybe cobol :)
[01:34:33] <Cork> it includes everything from mp4, to canvas to css3 to js to dom to...
[01:34:40] <limpc> Cork: so was my assumption with the selector correct?
[01:34:48] <Cork> limpc: ya, but the term for what your talking about is html
[01:35:08] <Cork> limpc: no
[01:35:35] <limpc> hm, how do i do what im trying to do then?
[01:35:45] <Cork> $("li[data-type~='tri-id'], li[data-type~='quad-id']")? would be a possible way to do it
[01:36:00] <Cork> though i wouldn't recommend doing it that way
[01:36:22] <Cork> selecting on attribute contents is the next slowest thing you can do in a selector
[01:36:32] <Cork> better options is to use classes if you want to select on them
[01:38:18] <limpc> $("li.tri-id,li.quad-id")?
[01:38:25] <Cork> ya
[01:38:33] <limpc> no, that would select either, wouldnt it?
[01:38:38] <limpc> or will it require both
[01:38:47] <Cork> that would the old one do too
[01:38:55] <Cork> $("li.tri-id.quad-id") then
[01:39:24] <limpc> hmm ok ill try it
[01:39:26] <limpc> thanks
[01:39:29] <Cork> np
[01:40:40] <limpc> just to clarify, li.tri-id.quad-id would only match a li element with class="tri-id quad-id".  will it still work if theres another class before either of those id's? I've had problems with class selectors due to that in the past
[01:40:55] <Cork> yes
[01:41:04] <limpc> nice. perfect, then
[01:41:08] <Cork> it will match as long as both those classes are in the class list
[01:41:15] <Cork> no matter what other classes are there
[01:41:31] <Cork> and no-matter what order
[01:41:38] <Cork> thats why its better to use classes :(
[01:41:43] <Cork>  * :)
[01:41:46] <limpc> yea i cant remember the circumstances, but in the past ive had to do something like li[class^=classname]
[01:42:05] <limpc> oh nm.. it was due to some dynamic values
[01:42:07] <Cork> limpc: ya, if you go back to ie6 it couldn't do combination classes
[01:42:30] <Cork> you had to merge all classes and have uniq class for each combination >_<
[01:42:34] <Cork> (it was hell)
[01:42:44] <limpc> i bet
[01:43:15] <Cork> like the css file with overrides for ie6 was longer then the entire css file for all other browsers :)

[02:17:18] <Eviltwin> Uh... it's not?
[02:17:26] <Eviltwin> A page can only have one status code

[02:17:39] <Cork> :)
[02:19:19] <fat> i have a simple TICKER. I was wondering after 5 seconds AFTER the typing has finished, then it would go to the next text, instead of starting the timer as soon as the typing starts. please help !! http://jsfiddle.net/me899/
[02:21:44] <fat> help pls
[02:24:47] <ChrisReilly> EvilTwin: so I'll treat internal 404s as an exception and handle it?
[02:24:55] <Eviltwin> Sure
[02:25:17] <fat> ?
[02:27:06] <Eviltwin> fat: I don't understand the question
[02:27:21] <Eviltwin> "I was wondering after 5 seconds AFTER the..." is a parse error
[02:27:27] <fat> eviltwin: look at this. i typed the question down http://jsfiddle.net/me899/1/
[02:27:32] <fat> eviltwin: sorry
[02:28:13] <Eviltwin> So you want it to start as soon as it finishes typing or you want it to transition 5 seconds after it finishes?
[02:28:37] <fat> or you want it to transition 5 seconds after it finishes?
[02:28:41] <fat> ^
[02:31:34] <ohcibi> fat: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13326058/infinite-loop-for-jticker-plugin
[02:32:05] <fat> ohcibi: its too slow
[02:32:24] <ohcibi> fat: what do you mean to slow?
[02:32:31] <Eviltwin> This was not a very well thought out plugin
[02:32:50] <fat> ohcibi: i like my plugin better.
[02:32:59] <Eviltwin> There's no way to detect when it finishes
[02:33:12] <fat> eviltwin: thank you anyway
[02:33:55] <fat> eviltwi: is there anyway" when it has finished typing the text, it makes a new line and continues writing the next transition text, (leaving the original first text as it is)
[02:34:16] <ohcibi> fat: i see no difference in usage.. cant you just apply the principle of the answer on your problem?
[02:34:40] <fat> ohcibi: if i can, i woudn't be here.
[02:36:49] <ohcibi> fat: i dont understand your problem... the jticker scripts used in your example and the one used in the fiddle with the loop are the same, what dont you like then about the other plugin?
[02:37:27] <fat> orcibi: i dont want an infinit loop
[02:38:02] <ohcibi> fat: why do you set setInterval then? it produces one
[02:38:44] <fat> orcibi: i need ~3. when the first one finished typing, instead of replacing it with the next transition, i want it to create a new line and type it at the bottom instead.
[02:41:52] <Olive6767> Is there a shorter version for: if(el.hasClass('slideshow') || el.parent().hasClass('slideshow')) do_something();  ?
[02:41:57] <ohcibi> fat: dose this http://jsfiddle.net/ohcibi/me899/4/ demosntrate the problem well?
[02:42:22] <ohcibi> fat: the fact that the ticker is replaced before it is typed out?
[02:42:48] <fat> orcibi: thank u so muchf or trying ur best
[02:43:06] <fat> orcibi: but whats wrong with my ticker? why do u edit the stackoverflow one instead of mine?
[02:43:57] <ohcibi> fat: ?
[02:44:02] <fat> oricbi: wow
[02:44:10] <fat> orcibi: wait, you did it
[02:44:14] <ohcibi> fat: i put your script inside the js panel of jsfiddle
[02:44:14] <fat> orcibi: wow thanks soo much
[02:44:21] <ohcibi> oO
[02:44:22] <fat> orcibi: yeah i see.
[02:44:36] <fat> orcibi: but, can't you make it start the timer after the text has finished typign?
[02:44:50] <ohcibi> fat: and i removed the shuffle stuff completely as it has nothing to do with the problem.. but i dont see what i've fixed 8-)
[02:45:25] <ohcibi> fat: i've only pointed out the problem a bit more....
[02:45:52] <fat> orcibi: i edited the speed of typing. it was 200, now its 20 it types faster. but i need it to start couting after it finishes typing
[02:46:15] <ohcibi> fat: try ohcibi and use tab-completion for nicknames...
[02:46:43] <ohcibi> fat: yes I understand that now.. i dont know the lib. i'm just on their websites and it slows down my browser... so you may consider not to use it 8-)
[02:47:01] <fat> orcibi: ok thx
[03:03:44] <fRAiLtY-> What would be the most reliable way to get a select element which has a dynamic ID, baring in mind there are several other selects on the page
[03:04:17] <Lucky--> just find it by parent
[03:04:20] <Lucky--> then do .closest
[03:04:58] <fRAiLtY-> Let me rephrase that, imagine a div with 6 selects in, I want to always get a specific one, but it's ID is different each time
[03:05:06] <Lucky--> or use standard selector of say $(".parentclass > select")
[03:05:19] <Lucky--> thats easy
[03:05:25] <fRAiLtY-> .eq() ?
[03:05:51] <Lucky--> $(".classname > select")[0].val()
[03:06:11] <fRAiLtY-> [0] meaning the first one yes?
[03:06:14] <Lucky--> yep
[03:06:23] <Lucky--> $(".classname > select")[0].each(function(idx,el){dostuff})
[03:06:26] <Lucky--> err
[03:06:30] <Lucky--> $(".classname > select").each(function(idx,el){dostuff})
[03:06:32] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, another curveball, what if it has the possibility of changing position within that list
[03:06:33] <Lucky--> thats the other way
[03:06:50] <Lucky--> then you should rethink your design
[03:06:50] <fRAiLtY-> Basically, it could appear "anywhere" on the page in any order, and has a dynamic id
[03:07:00] <Lucky--> are you trying to write a scraper or something?
[03:07:30] <Lucky--> i mean you could always parse the dom as a string and use regex
[03:07:37] <fRAiLtY-> No, I'm dealing with a mess! I think I'll just have to insist my admin staff are more careful,
[03:07:44] <Lucky--> elaborate
[03:09:50] <Tumulte> hey
[03:10:03] <fRAiLtY-> Let me try and explain, we sell printed products. The first 4 selects you'll see are always the same and have fixed ID's, no problem. The subsequent "x" drop-downs (beginning with Single or double sided) represent an individual products options. So think of the first 4 options as a "picker" eventually you arrive at 1 product, then it loads that product's options, these are what vary. If my admin staff add options to that product and move the order about, I
[03:10:04] <fRAiLtY-> can't get the data reliably
[03:10:05] <fRAiLtY-> http://imgur.com/hlOPKib
[03:10:10] <fRAiLtY-> Yes, it's a nightmare
[03:12:07] <Lucky--> hold opening
[03:12:32] <Lucky--> why not just reference the item by key
[03:12:38] <Lucky--> by the db pk
[03:13:49] <fRAiLtY-> How do you mean sorry?

[03:52:02] <karstenk1977_> please look console to the livesite http://drews.tom-develop.com/fotografie/galerien/
[03:52:05] <Cork> hah, true >_>
[03:52:14] <Cork> missed that completely
[03:52:31] <karstenk1977_> my two ul elements doesnÂ´t have the expected format in array
[03:52:56] <Cork> karstenk1977_: jQuery('#'+[this.id]+' .csc-textpic-imagecolumn ul') => jQuery(this).find('.csc-textpic-imagecolumn ul')
[03:53:53] <karstenk1977_> same error
[03:54:05] <Cork> ah your returning it to map
[03:54:19] <Cork> that is most likely not what you want wither
[03:54:29] <Cork> uh....
[03:54:33] <karstenk1977_> that is what eviltwin said
[03:54:36] <Cork> why arn't you using each btw?
[03:54:50] <Cork> .map( => .each(
[03:54:55] <karstenk1977_> cause iÂ´m a dao :-(
[03:54:59] <Cork> and remove the return
[03:55:12] <karstenk1977_> I will pastbin the whole javascript moment
[03:55:15] <Cork> (and the else clause all together)
[03:55:35] <Eviltwin> karstenk1977_: You asked for one thing and then did something completely different instead
[03:55:39] <Eviltwin> You can't blame me for it
[03:55:57] <Eviltwin> "Syntax error, unrecognized expression" comes from an error with a jQuery selector
[03:56:27] <karstenk1977_> http://pastebin.com/ci4xv3BK
[03:56:46] <karstenk1977_> yeah sry ;-)
[03:57:45] <Cork> that looks like the totally wrong thing to do with mSlider
[03:57:53] <karstenk1977_> I would like to search fpr csc-default which contains more than one li.scs-textpic and push the parent ul to mSlider array
[03:57:56] <Cork> your actually storing an array with jquery arrays of elements
[03:58:08] <Cork> instead of storing just a jquery array
[03:58:39] <karstenk1977_> yes, mSlider contains all elements which will be animated by bxSlider
[03:59:01] <karstenk1977_> so now I have to push my ulÂ´s in there
[03:59:44] <Cork> mSlider = jQuery('.csc-default.csc-type-textpic .csc-textpic-imagecolumn ul').filter(function() { return jQuery(this).find('li.csc-textpic-image').length > 0; });
[03:59:47] <karstenk1977_> the difference is, that the ul from csc-default doesnÂ´t have the attr. ID
[04:00:02] <Cork> that shoukd do mostely the same thing as that weird map array thing
[04:01:03] <Eviltwin> karstenk1977_: Your error is origninating from jQuery(slideElements)
[04:01:12] <Eviltwin> Because slideElements works out to "[object Object],[object Object],#slider"
[04:01:43] <Cork> uh... your joining jquery objects to a string...
[04:01:45] <Cork> >_<
[04:01:47] <karstenk1977_> http://drews.tom-develop.com/fotografie/galerien/
[04:02:06] <Cork> karstenk1977_: var slideElements = mSlider.join(); <-- this will not do what you want, ever
[04:02:06] <karstenk1977_> sry, but it doesnt work, the keys are different in mSlider
[04:02:21] <Eviltwin> ?add @ karstenk1977_
[04:02:26] <Eviltwin> ...
[04:02:27] <Cork> just use the filer i gave you before and use that
[04:02:34] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[04:02:39] <Cork> it will give you a valid sliderElents from the start
[04:02:46] <Cork> no need to add or anything
[04:02:48] <karstenk1977_> I have added your line Cork, see the result in site
[04:02:50] <Eviltwin> He did use that filter but he wants to add something else to it
[04:03:10] <dr-no> hi
[04:03:19] <Eviltwin> Sometimes I describe people as having a "dangerous level of knowledge"
[04:03:32] <Eviltwin> Where they know enough to shit out code
[04:03:42] <Eviltwin> But don't really understand how it works or what's going on
[04:03:58] <Cork> Eviltwin: there is a name for that
[04:04:13] <dr-no> i need help with a little script using jquery/ajax and a bit of php/mysql, so if there is anyone willing to help , please pm me , thanks ahead.
[04:04:13] <Eviltwin> Is it karstenk1977_?
[04:04:13] <NCS_One> hi
[04:04:14] <karstenk1977_> DidnÂ´t you start same?
[04:04:16] <Cork> though i will refrain from using it :)
[04:04:56] <Cork> karstenk1977_: none of the js files loads on your page :/
[04:05:21] <Cork> ah no its my source viewer that doens't respect base
[04:05:33] <karstenk1977_> ?
[04:05:42] <Cork> (why are you using base btw >_<)
[04:05:48] <Eviltwin> karstenk1977_: .join() on an Array does not and will not do what you want it to do
[04:05:56] <Cork> ya
[04:06:12] <Eviltwin> Stop trying to use it
[04:07:02] <karstenk1977_> but this works in other sites, only the new ul without attr. ID are the problems
[04:07:27] <Cork> karstenk1977_: the code is quite horribly broken
[04:07:36] <Cork> theres just...
[04:07:40] <Cork> ugg...
[04:08:09] <dr-no> guess no one can help me with my script. ok i will not bother anyone. thank you.
[04:08:20] <Cork> karstenk1977_: ok, lets try to fix this
[04:08:29] <Cork> karstenk1977_: var mSlider = []; => var mSlider = $([]);
[04:09:11] <Eviltwin> karstenk1977_: http://jsfiddle.net/sG4R2/
[04:09:22] <Eviltwin> Notice how there are completely different variables and selectors there
[04:09:25] <Cork> line 539 - 544 =>  mSlider.add('#slider').each(function() {
[04:09:34] <Eviltwin> This is a nice opportunity for you to think
[04:09:46] <Eviltwin> And figure out how to apply the same transformation to your code
[04:10:18] <karstenk1977_> I cannot follow both, please only one instruction. it is hard enough for me to follow one
[04:10:32] <Eviltwin> Then maybe you should hire someone to do this
[04:11:20] <Cork> karstenk1977_: basically you need to learn whats the difference between selectors, objects, html and dom
[04:11:54] <Cork> cause your mixing it up quite heavily right now
[04:12:55] <Eviltwin> karstenk1977_: This is an example of the reworked code doing what you want it to do: http://jsfiddle.net/hAF5y/
[04:13:16] <karstenk1977_> mSlider should contain the selectors and that there are in two Objects is the resultat of now
[04:13:30] <Eviltwin> A selector cannot be an object
[04:13:40] <karstenk1977_> I know
[04:13:42] <Cork> Eviltwin: no need to go all the extra work around map
[04:13:52] <Cork> filter can do it all for you
[04:14:10] <Cork> at least in his case
[04:14:27] <karstenk1977_> Everything in my code exclude mSlider = jQuery('.csc-default.csc-type-textpic .csc-textpic-imagecolumn ul').filter(function() { return jQuery(this).find('li.csc-textpic-image').length > 0; });  works
[04:14:46] <karstenk1977_> only this line from Cork returns Objects and not selectors
[04:14:58] <Eviltwin> IT CAN'T RETURN A SELECTOR
[04:15:06] <Eviltwin> JUST USE THE GODDAMN ELEMENTS
[04:15:41] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[04:15:44] <Eviltwin> I'm done for the night
[04:15:50] <Eviltwin> Good luck
[04:15:59] <Cork> good fight ^^
[04:16:39] <Cork> karstenk1977_: like i said before; you need to figure out the differences between selectors, dom, html and objects
[04:16:48] <Cork> cause your mixing them up in a none compatible way
[04:17:19] <karstenk1977_> I know the difference and that I need the selectors in mSlider relies to a lot of other scripts in my typo3
[04:17:55] <karstenk1977_> iÂ´m do not mixing it up, I was only follow your snippet
[04:18:11] <karstenk1977_> I never wanted pushing Objects to mSlider
[04:18:12] <Cork> karstenk1977_: if you must have selectors you can't use find, filter or anything like that on it before
[04:18:30] <Cork> you can't filter what elements are matched before hand in a case like that
[04:18:42] <karstenk1977_> ok
[04:18:45] <Cork> as it demands that you actually loop over the elements
[04:18:51] <Cork> so you can't do that kind of filtering at all
[04:19:12] <Cork> and as i said before, if you just fix up the code to work with the elements from the start
[04:19:15] <Cork> it would just work
[04:19:21] <karstenk1977_> then I wonÂ´t push them to mSlider and initial bxSlider again with the array of Objects
[04:19:36] <Cork> that won't work
[04:19:42] <Cork> as its an array of jquery objects
[04:20:17] <Cork> thats why i said the entire thing needs to be fixed, cause it fails in more then one place
[04:22:41] <karstenk1977_> that has code a "graduate Informatic Ingineer" not me ;-)  but he has left and now I have to fix by myself ;-(
[04:23:10] <Cork> karstenk1977_: then make the correct fix, its not that hard
[04:23:24] <karstenk1977_> ok, if I understand you correctly than I have to change the inline scripts which pushes selectors in my mSlider array too
[04:23:26] <Cork> but ya, you should prob start by learning how the language work
[04:23:51] <Cork> karstenk1977_: as it makes the selection there yes
[04:24:02] <Cork> just make it happen at the top instead
[04:24:17] <Cork> (when you loop it and you have the elements, just store it
[04:24:18] <Cork> )
[04:25:09] <karstenk1977_> look at here, in this site there are the inline scripts  http://www.gtb21.de/blog/
[04:25:31] <karstenk1977_> <script type="text/javascript">/*&lt;![CDATA[*/if (jQuery('#blogentry92 .csc-textpic-imagewrap &gt; div').length &gt; 1)mSlider.push('#blogentry92 .csc-textpic-imagewrap');/*]]&gt;*/</script>
[04:25:40] <Cork> what does inline have to do with it?
[04:25:54] <Cork> ah it pushes selectors too...
[04:26:15] <karstenk1977_> yes, and if I want to change the initialize I have to change them too
[04:26:22] <Cork> ugg...
[04:26:36] <Cork> i'm sooo glad i don't have to take over that mess...
[04:27:49] <karstenk1977_> so you think I have to push Objects in that array?
[04:28:24] <Cork> no, you can't
[04:28:41] <Cork> you would have to keep using selectors, and you can't do filtering on the element level
[04:28:49] <karstenk1977_> <script type="text/javascript">/*&lt;![CDATA[*/if (jQuery('#blogentry92 .csc-textpic-imagewrap &gt; div').length &gt; 1)mSlider.push(jQuery('#blogentry92 .csc-textpic-imagewrap'));/*]]&gt;*/</script>
[04:29:00] <Cork> or you would have to rewrite it to work correctly with elements
[04:29:15] <Cork> if you are going to rewrite that do it correctly
[04:29:25] <karstenk1977_> let us do it
[04:29:32] <karstenk1977_> is this coorect?
[04:29:36] <Cork> mSlider = mSlider.add('#blogentry92 .csc-textpic-imagewrap');
[04:29:48] <karstenk1977_> k
[04:30:19] <Cork> you will also have to change the filter line i gave you before
[04:30:35] <Cork> so it doesn't replace whats in the variable already
[04:31:14] <Cork> mSlider = jQuery('.csc-default.csc-type-textpic .csc-textpic-imagecolumn ul').filter(function() { return jQuery(this).find('li.csc-textpic-image').length > 0; }).add(mSlider);
[04:31:44] <karstenk1977_> <script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/if (jQuery('#blogentry{field:uid} .csc-textpic-imagewrap > div').length > 1) mSlider = mSlider.add('#blogentry{field:uid} .csc-textpic-imagewrap');/*]]>*/</script>
[04:31:56] <MACscr> i need a little help with my mobile menu http://jsfiddle.net/YehpW/15/. I know hte issue is with line 19 of the js. Seems to be applying to everything, including the ul thats supposed to open
[04:33:15] <Trudko> Guys i have few selects. I want to recreate each of them  and set new options for them stored ins tring  simplest way how to do that ?  http://jsbin.com/uwetan/1/edit
[04:33:27] <Cork> MACscr: $(this).next("ul") will find all ul
[04:33:44] <Cork> *'s that follows the current element (as a sibling) not just the next one
[04:33:48] <Cork> opps sorry
[04:33:51] <Cork> thats wrong
[04:34:07] <Cork> MACscr: mised up the functions a bit ;)
[04:34:34] <karstenk1977_> http://www.gtb21.de/blog/
[04:34:38] <Trudko> basicly i want to know how to if i have select tag <select id="s" class="something else"> how to get all atrbiutes or whole string so I can quickly create select with same attributes but without options
[04:34:41] <karstenk1977_> mSlider.add is not a function
[04:34:44] <Cork> MACscr: $("#nav-main > li > ul")
[04:35:11] <Cork> karstenk1977_: then you haven't replaced the array initiation that i mentioned before
[04:35:52] <Cork> karstenk1977_: var mSlider = [] => var mSlider = jQuery();
[04:36:18] <Braden`> Hello
[04:36:55] <Cork> Trudko: why not just clone the select element and remove its children?
[04:37:15] <QaDeS> hiyas. i attached a $('#myelem').live('click', ...) which works on desktop and android. any idea why it might not work on ipod?
[04:37:24] <Cork> Trudko: var newS = $('#s').clone(); newS.removeAttr('id').empty();
[04:37:40] <Trudko> Cork: yeah  that could be simpler
[04:37:50] <MACscr> Cork: that doesnt work as the others arent sliding up now
[04:37:51] <karstenk1977_> ok, now the inline works
[04:37:58] <karstenk1977_> now the ul elements
[04:38:06] <Braden`> http://ideone.com/YcfMuF <-- When I submit my form, nothing happens.  What am I doing wrong?
[04:38:08] <Cork> QaDeS: live is depricated in earlier versions and removed in modern versions of jquery
[04:38:15] <Cork> QaDeS: you should not use it
[04:38:24] <Cork> QaDeS: use delegate or on instead
[04:38:43] <QaDeS> does on support elements added at runtime?
[04:39:11] <anew> can you regex something like c:/fake/image.jpg with jquery to show only image.jpg ?
[04:39:13] <Cork> brad: line 28 - 30 is invalid
[04:39:36] <MACscr> $15 to the first person that figures out the issue and comes up with a fix =P
[04:39:36] <Cork> QaDeS: delegate does, and on has a delegate syntax
[04:39:39] <karstenk1977_> ok thanks Cork, change everything to Objects works now
[04:39:41] <MACscr> i need sleepy =(
[04:39:50] <Braden`> hmm
[04:40:32] <Braden`> Oh, I see
[04:40:43] <Braden`> It is supposed to be the last parm of the function
[04:41:05] <Cork> or you could add .done( after if you prefer that
[04:47:26] <MacroMan> with the .scroll() event, is there a way to see what triggered the event? I need to detect if the event was fired by me calling .scrollTop() from other code.
[04:48:06] <Cork> ugg
[04:48:28] <Cork> don't think so
[04:48:37] <Cork> but have a look on the event object that you get
[04:48:42] <Cork> there might be something usable there
[04:48:50] <Cork> (though i don't think so)
[04:49:36] <MacroMan> OK thanks. I can't seem to even get the event object to work though. jQuery('#'+id).scroll(e, function(){ is what I'm using, but I get undefined variable 'e'.
[04:50:47] <Cork> jQuery('#'+id).scroll(function(event)
[04:51:42] <MacroMan> Doh. Rookie mistake
[04:52:03] <Cork> heh, it happens :)
[04:52:09] * MacroMan sighs in disbelief at his own stupidity
[04:52:19] <MacroMan> Thank you
[04:52:23] <Cork> np
[04:52:48] <SpaceMouse> hey guys! can someone look at my code, i guess it's very simple for you guys... but why doesnt my simple eventhandler work? all i want it to do is to add text to the "live-data" field... thank you in advance! http://jsfiddle.net/nmft6/
[04:53:21] <MACscr> Cork: could you by chance expand on your advice for http://jsfiddle.net/YehpW/15/? you mentioned $("#nav-main > li > ul"), but where were you wanting that? on line 19 that i had mentioned? Whatever I do, i cant seem to get it to slide down in the right places and up on the others
[04:53:23] <MACscr> lol
[04:54:27] <Cork> SpaceMouse: why don't you just use jquery for that event listener too?
[04:54:42] <Cork> ah, cause it wrapps the event object
[04:54:53] <SpaceMouse> i dont know, im a newbie at this... can you explain to me how i can do that? THANKS!
[04:55:13] <Cork> $(window).on('storage', function(event) {});
[04:55:21] <Trudko> Cork: btw i found for what I need something like this would be enough but not sure why first dropdown is empty http://jsbin.com/uwetan/2/edit
[04:55:23] <Cork> but i don't think newValue will be correct there
[04:56:08] <SpaceMouse> okay, should i replace ->>  $("#live-data").html("Live-data: " + event.newValue);
[04:56:23] <SpaceMouse> with the line that you wrote?
[04:56:35] <Cork> MACscr: $("#nav-main li ul") will match every ul that has at least one li parent that s a child of #nav-main
[04:56:43] <Cork> MACscr: i suspect thats why it fails for you
[04:57:11] <Cork> Trudko: you need to clone
[04:57:21] <Cork> else you actually change the orignal
[04:57:39] <Cork> or rather you actually move them from the original
[04:58:25] <Trudko> see
[04:59:01] <Cork> SpaceMouse: $(window).on('storage', function(event) { $("#live-data").html("Live-data: " + event.originalEvent.newValue); });
[04:59:04] <Cork> that should work
[04:59:32] <MACscr> Cork: but from the looks of that code, its supposed to slide up everything and just slide down that one as you can see on line 23
[05:02:31] <SpaceMouse> Cork: Thank you for your help. I havn't got it to work yet, i've tried to paste the line you wrote but nothing happens... can you look at my updated jsfiddle page if i have done it right? Thanks once again... http://jsfiddle.net/nmft6/1/
[05:02:38] <MACscr> there isnt a channel like #css-lance, but for jquery/js is there? I just need to solve this issue so i can sleep. Its 7am and i have to get up in 3 hours =(
[05:03:29] <Cork> MACscr: i think its event bubbling thats messing with you, but not sure, have a bit of a hard time following your code
[05:04:23] <Cork> MACscr: ex. what is $(this).parent().has("ul") meant to do??
[05:04:50] <MacroMan> Cork: For info, there's nothing in the event object for .scroll() to determine what fired it.
[05:05:00] <Cork> your target is an a-tag, it can't ever have a direct parent htat is an ul element
[05:05:23] <Cork> MacroMan: was afraid of that
[05:05:27] <MACscr> Cork: that just prevents links from doing their default behavior within the ul
[05:05:37] <Cork> no
[05:05:45] <Cork> as that part can't ever be true
[05:05:56] <Cork> <ul><a> <-- invalid
[05:06:17] <Cork> <ul><li><a> $(this).parent().has('ul') == false
[05:06:59] <MACscr> i dont know,thats from a tutorial. im 99% sure its not related to the issue though
[05:07:54] <Cork> also you binding a new listener to each element in the menu every time someone resizes the window
[05:08:03] <Guest1234> does anyone know of a good JQuery plugin for tree menus?
[05:08:03] <bot-t> (781 hours ago) <ben_alman> tell Guest1234 hi!
[05:08:05] <firesky> @Cork Does this would work? <ul><li><a> $(this).parent("ul") ?
[05:08:11] <Cork> if you move it a round a little you will end up with hundreds of listeners on each element
[05:08:14] <ben_alman> lol
[05:08:28] <Cork> firesky: no, it just checks the closest parent
[05:08:43] <Cork> firesky: but ya, it will do almost the same thing as has (but fail just as much)
[05:08:44] <Trudko> cork btw i have more then one dropdown so do I need to clone everytime i append children like here?  http://jsbin.com/uwetan/2/edit#/uwetan/3/edit
[05:08:50] <Trudko> there shouldnt be any problem should it
[05:09:14] <Cork> Trudko: dom elements is uniq
[05:09:19] <Cork> they don't clone on them self
[05:09:28] <Trudko> so yes it make sense.
[05:09:31] <Cork> if you append a dom element that exist in one place on another place, it will move
[05:09:40] <Trudko> yeah make sense
[05:09:46] <Guest1234> is there a preferred plugin for Tree menus?
[05:09:47] <Trudko> so there shouldn be problem with approach I used?
[05:09:54] <Guest1234> kind of like a file explorer in windows?
[05:10:01] <Cork> Trudko: you clone twice :)
[05:10:08] <Cork> other then that, nope
[05:10:17] <Trudko> ou yeah i left the old code there.
[05:10:24] <Trudko> i watched inception lately so...
[05:10:27] <Trudko> :0
[05:11:11] <Cork> firesky: just to be clear, the problem with that line of code is that the only valid child of ul is li
[05:11:19] <Cork> firesky: so the selector can't ever be true
[05:11:47] <Cork> cause you can't have a link as a child of ul
[05:11:53] <Cork> it can be a grand child though
[05:12:01] <MACscr> well im off to bed. My head hurts to much and i need to get 2.5 hours sleep before my appointments today =(
[05:12:06] <MACscr> thanks for at least trying
[05:12:42] <Cork> good luck!
[05:17:01] <anew> can you regex something like c:/fake/image.jpg with jquery to show only image.jpg ?
[05:17:27] <Cork> not with jquery, but with native js
[05:17:44] <anew> would that be the best way to extract image.jpg
[05:18:15] <ekpyrotic> Guys, got a set of pictures on top of each other. Animating top on to the left, resetting and changing z-index to 0. How do I select the next one down.
[05:18:16] <Cork> ?eval 'c:/fake/image.jpg'.match(/[^\/]+$/)[0]
[05:18:18] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:18:29] <ekpyrotic> top one*
[05:18:44] <anew> hmmm that's pretty sick
[05:18:52] <anew> thanks cork
[05:18:52] <Cork> you could prob use split too
[05:19:00] <anew> split is jq ?
[05:19:03] <Cork> ?eval 'c:/fake/image.jpg'.split('/')
[05:19:04] <bot-t> Cork: ["c:", "fake", "image.jpg"]
[05:19:05] <anew> wait match is jq isnt it ?
[05:19:44] <firesky> <anew> match and split is clear js
[05:19:55] <firesky> it's not part of jq
[05:19:57] <Cork> ?eval var path = 'c:/fake/image.jpg'.split('/'); path[path.length -1]
[05:19:58] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:20:01] <anew> ok ok
[05:20:26] <Cork> (wish js had a last array member ;) )
[05:21:33] <Cork> ?eval path = 'c:/fake/image.jpg'; path.substring(path.lastIndexOf('/'))
[05:21:34] <bot-t> Cork: "/image.jpg"
[05:21:39] <Cork> ?eval path = 'c:/fake/image.jpg'; path.substring(path.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)
[05:21:39] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:21:43] <firesky> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3235043/last-element-of-array-in-javascript ???
[05:21:53] <Cork> anew: as you see there is many ways to skin a cat ;)
[05:22:02] <firesky> could it help?
[05:22:25] <Cork> hmm slice
[05:22:40] <Cork> havne't even though of that
[05:23:01] <Cork> ?eval 'c:/fake/image.jpg'.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
[05:23:01] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:23:41] <Cork> not pritty, and i'm not sure its behaves nicely (thinkning about object gc)
[05:23:53] <phrearch> hi
[05:24:02] <anew> actually that slice one
[05:24:04] <anew> is probably the best
[05:24:04] <Cork> firesky: but ya, it is a way to get it, thanks for the idea
[05:24:12] <anew> because file path will not always be c:/fake/
[05:24:18] <phrearch> wondering how i can catch a drop/dragover event on an element using jquery
[05:24:21] <anew> maybe it's c:/a/b/c/fake/image.jpg
[05:24:25] <anew> that will work for any path right
[05:24:33] <Cork> anew: all of them will grab the exact same thing
[05:24:35] <phrearch> something like $('dropbox').on('dragover', function(ev) { doesnt work
[05:24:41] <Cork> none of them check from the beginning
[05:24:52] <anew> 'exact same thing' = end o fpath ?
[05:24:53] <anew> oh ok
[05:24:53] <Cork> ?eval 'c:/a/b/c/fake/image.jpg'.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
[05:24:54] <anew> perfecto
[05:24:54] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:25:03] <Cork> ?eval path = 'c:/a/b/c/fake/image.jpg'; path.substring(path.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)
[05:25:04] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:25:13] <Cork> ?eval 'c:/a/b/c/fake/image.jpg'.match(/[^\/]+$/)[0]
[05:25:13] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:25:37] <Cork> ?eval var path = 'c:/a/b/c/fake/image.jpg'.split('/'); path[path.length -1]
[05:25:38] <bot-t> Cork: "image.jpg"
[05:25:52] <Cork> they search for the last / and grab everything thats after that
[05:25:55] <anew> cool
[05:26:04] <anew> well i was looking for a jq image preview for file input
[05:26:07] <anew> but couldnt find anything
[05:26:07] <Cork> that was kinda the point from the start :)
[05:26:09] <anew> so will use this instead
[05:26:21] <dblosevn> ?eval 'c:/a/b/c/fake/image.jpg'.split('/').pop()
[05:26:22] <bot-t> dblosevn: "image.jpg"
[05:26:30] <Cork> dblosevn++
[05:26:32] <anew> pop ?
[05:26:36] <Cork> THAT one i like
[05:26:57] <Cork> ?mdc array.pop
[05:27:03] <bot-t> Cork, Array.pop - JavaScript | MDN - Removes the last element from an array and returns that element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop
[05:27:13] <anew> booyah
[05:27:33] <dblosevn> i use that one a lot lol
[05:28:11] <Cork> well it's ok as long as you don't want the original array
[05:28:17] <Cork> as it actually removes it from it
[05:28:30] <Cork> but in this case, ya, its nice
[05:28:34] <sunbeam> hi, i would like to translate datatables jquery plugin to another language than english
[05:28:37] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[05:28:40] <sunbeam> "Show xx entries" etc
[05:28:42] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[05:28:42] <masentinel900> Some have Idea what is this error log ::  -- [08:25:24.688] TypeError: s.handler.apply is not a function @ http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js:3
[05:29:06] <Cork> sunbeam: best is prob to use a template plugin
[05:29:47] <Cork> sunbeam: ex jqote2
[05:29:59] <Cork> ?g jquery.jqote2
[05:30:00] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 â€“ Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code â†’ http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[05:30:01] <bot-t> Cork, jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[05:31:11] <dblosevn> ya i only use it when im only interested in the last element of the array
[05:31:39] <dblosevn> now a built in javascript implementation of php list() would be awesome
[05:31:55] <seutje> masentinel900: you probably passed something that wasn't a function to something that expected a function
[05:31:59] <Cork> dblosevn: es6
[05:32:20] <seutje> masentinel900: protip: dev with a dev version
[05:32:34] <freannrak> hey, my jquery UI progress bar looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/qF0fFvr.png?1 - how can I get it working with animated-overlay.gif? I've included the images folder along with the jquery-ui.css
[05:32:45] <sunbeam> Cork: i have no idea how this works
[05:32:55] <sunbeam> isn't there an easy way to translate a few standard "dataTables" things
[05:33:17] <Cork> sunbeam: you need something to hold the template that you put your data into
[05:33:55] <sunbeam> Cork: it's not related to the template
[05:34:07] <Cork> sunbeam: thats where the templating plugin comes in, so you can have something like "Show <% value %> entries"
[05:34:11] <seutje> doesn't datatables support i18n?
[05:34:30] <seutje> also, datatables supports providing it with custom templates
[05:34:32] <Cork> ah he's talking about a plugin:S
[05:34:47] <Cork> i though he was talking about translating things from the database >_<
[05:34:50] <Cork> sorry about that
[05:37:35] <seutje> yeah, that's what he started with :P
[05:37:59] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/dQyb3/
[05:38:07] <masentinel900> That is my function..
[05:38:15] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/aPQqw/
[05:38:18] <anew> cork can u take a look at that
[05:38:25] <anew> i tried to chain what u had above
[05:38:29] <anew> but still getting entire filepath
[05:40:08] <dblosevn> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/7fS5n/
[05:40:08] <seutje> sunbeam: looked into http://www.datatables.net/plug-ins/i18n ?
[05:41:29] <anew> lol i'm such a moron
[05:41:31] <anew> thanks dblosevn
[05:41:48] <dblosevn> np
[05:42:00] <seutje> sunbeam: u can also just set them during initalization http://www.datatables.net/usage/i18n
[05:51:45] <masentinel900> Guys I have a problem!!
[05:52:56] <seutje> Guy we know!!
[05:53:59] <masentinel900> I have a function onclick which open a fancybox window
[05:55:06] <masentinel900> the first time works ok, But the second and third time show me error log $.facnybox is not a function
[05:55:14] <masentinel900> Why?
[05:55:45] <seutje> is this where I guess your code?
[05:56:14] <seutje> I'ma go with scoping issue, if I must guess at this point, without any actual information
[05:56:50] <dblosevn> well im gonna take a wild guess that $.facnybox  really isnt a function
[05:57:22] <seutje> btw masentinel900, did you use bind, on or did you really go all element.onclick = function(){ ... } ?
[06:04:03] <dblosevn> i wouldnt think scope would be the issue only 2 things i know of that would cause that, overwriting or deleteing $.fancybox or reloading jquery
[06:04:47] <seutje> or noconflict
[06:05:35] <seutje> I just guessed scope cause I have pretty much no info and scoping issues are common in the javamascripts
[06:07:31] <dblosevn> yep lol, but $.fancybox is a plugin lol
[06:08:11] <dblosevn> noconflict is a really good canidate but it wouldnt work at all
[06:08:35] <dblosevn> unless noconflict was called in the onclick listener after the call to $.fancybox
[06:11:26] <phrearch> trying to make a draggable event
[06:11:26] <phrearch> http://jsfiddle.net/e9YsH/1/
[06:11:34] <phrearch> any idea how to make elements draggable/droppable?
[06:11:42] <phrearch> using html5 drag/drop
[06:17:42] <Kasimir> phrearch you could use jQuery UI and $('#drag').draggable();
[06:18:34] <phrearch> Kasimir: trying to avoid jquery ui, but they have that working properly yes
[06:18:50] <phrearch> not bcause of jquery ui, but i already have tbootstrap
[06:19:02] <phrearch> having both seems a bit overkill
[06:19:20] <phrearch> or maybe i can use only the components i need
[06:21:33] <Kasimir> phreach: twitter bootstrap is essentially just a stylesheet, two different things really
[06:22:28] <ezhilvanan> How can i Make Jquery Dialog as Synchronous like Confirm or alert?
[06:25:38] <systemfault> You can't
[06:26:33] <ezhilvanan> systemfault, then how Confirm() and alert() box can do this?
[06:27:09] <systemfault> ezhilvanan: the browser's host objects and functions don't need to respect the rules of JS
[06:28:00] <systemfault> alert() backend code is not JSâ€¦ it's some C/C++
[06:28:05] <marvi> Kasimir: jQuery UI and Bootstrap overlap for some things. Tabs, dialogs, accordion.
[06:29:10] <lyrae> i make an ajax request and get json data back...but how do i detect when an error 500 happened in the server and i dont get data back?
[06:29:14] <ezhilvanan> systemfault, oh really ?!.. thanks
[06:29:21] <Kasimir> marvi: yes but essentially twitter bootsrap is only a base css, you can strip all the javascript out of it
[06:44:36] <jonez> greetings. I'm using jquery to poll a url on my site and replace a div with whatever the result is. I made a script that calls fadeOut(), replaces the html, and then calls fadeIn(). the problem is that sometimes the data changes before the fadeout. is there a way I can make it more syncronous?
[06:50:49] <didiergm> jonez if guess you mean before the fadein finishes ?
[06:51:04] <jonez> didiergm, ya.. kinda hard to describe
[06:51:29] <jonez> but it looks like the effects and the data replacement are run async
[06:51:48] <didiergm> jonesz what happens if you don't react immediately to the new data - ie set up a flag saying 'don't poll now I am busy showing the previous stuff
[06:52:05] <jonez> didiergm, is there a wait()?
[06:52:43] <jonez> also I have $("div.foo").fadeIn(..); $("div.foo").html();.. should I maybe "chain" the calls?
[06:52:44] <didiergm> jonesz not that I know of.  but
[06:53:12] <didiergm> you could use the complete option of fadout
[06:53:19] <didiergm> fadeout
[06:53:35] <jonez> or maybe the $.getAjax() call?
[06:53:55] <didiergm> also you can reduce de duration of the effect; won't kill it
[06:54:04] <jonez> er.. sorry getJSON()
[06:54:27] <didiergm> Ijonesz I assumed the faout/update/ fadein was called in the success part of the ajax call
[06:54:38] <HarryPitfall> hello people, I need to check if a element already have a "on" event listener, for a given selector
[06:54:53] <HarryPitfall> $element.on('click', selector, ...)
[06:55:12] <HarryPitfall> how i can check if the selector is already listened?
[06:55:36] <wolfehr> when dealing with remotely loaded html with no container div (e.g. lots of elements in the html fragment with no parent), I'm having issues where things like find() and html() aren't working correctly. Is this normal?
[06:55:40] <jonez> didiergm, it's the 2nd parameter to the .getJSON call
[06:56:55] <didiergm> jonesz so you would have : If IcanPoll  $.ajax ( {success : function (data) { if data needs updating then Icanpoll=false, fadeout(200, function () { update  html, fadein(200, function() {IcanPoll=true
[06:57:02] <didiergm> or something along those lines
[06:58:06] <didiergm> jonesz how do you call your getJSOn, I expect in a timeout callback ?
[06:58:15] <jonez> didiergm, it's being called at a 5s interval
[06:58:29] <jonez> didiergm, yes
[06:59:15] <didiergm> jonesz In that case, then restart the timeout in the complete function of the fadein if there was an update or in the success if there was no update
[06:59:54] <didiergm> jonesz that said, I am surprised that with a 5s interval, the fadein/fadeout is not finished, the default being 400ms!
[07:00:06] <jonez> I set them to 1000ms :)
[07:01:02] <didiergm> jonez hmmmmm would still mean that the html update take over 3 secs! this does not sound too good
[07:01:08] <jonez> I'd rather not rely on timing to get the effect I want :)
[07:01:26] <jonez> nah, it looks like they are being called async
[07:01:56] <didiergm> jonez could be that you need to specify queue:false in the parameters of fadeout/fadein
[07:02:05] <jonez> didiergm, ah :)
[07:02:19] <jonez> is it the 2nd argument?
[07:02:29] <jonez> 1st arg is duration, 2nd arg is options?
[07:02:40] <didiergm> jonez : http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/ :)
[07:03:10] <jonez> didiergm, got it. ty for your help :)
[07:03:22] <didiergm> jonez pleasure
[07:05:15] <wolfehr> does remoteloey loaded html always have to be enclosed in a container div?
[07:06:30] <resonant> what does , mean in javascript? like these 5 lines: http://tabbit.org/Sgb6w
[07:08:44] <pachet> resonant: the author is just being unnecessarily confusing
[07:08:53] <resonant> oh ok
[07:09:08] <pachet> they're using , to chain together the last two evaluations in that statement, the .addClass() and .ready(func
[07:09:24] <pachet> notice they're after the window.location.hash === '#signature' &&
[07:09:38] <pachet> meaning, only do these two subsequent things if the hash is '#signature'
[07:09:45] <pachet> lot harder to read than a simple if block
[07:09:48] <resonant> oh i see
[07:09:51] <resonant> indeed
[07:10:38] <pachet> wolfehr: no
[07:10:43] <resonant> but i though , meant precedence
[07:11:10] <resonant> so inside the documet ready, does it mean do line #3, then #4?
[07:11:22] <dcherman> resonant: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator
[07:11:28] <dcherman> that said, that is absolutely terrible code.
[07:11:51] <resonant> reading link, thanks
[07:12:46] <pachet> resonant: it connotes rightmost precedent, but only when you're evaluating the statement
[07:12:50] <pachet> here there's no evaluation
[07:12:59] <pachet> the statement is just pooped out for 'coolness'
[07:13:27] <pachet> but yeah, like dcherman said, the code is trying to be flashy and coming off looking foolish
[07:17:01] <resonant> whoever wrote that code loves the comma operator. rest of the code is full of thm
[07:18:56] <dcherman> it's not by any chance pretty printed output from a minified file is it?  from a minifier, using the comma operator is perfectly acceptable
[07:19:05] <dcherman> if it's not from minified output, then yea, avoid that author's code.
[07:31:19] <jonez> greetings. I have the following script: http://pastebin.com/MLKKuz8K .. my trouble is that I need to pass the 'data' var, currently the alert() call shows "undefined"

[07:43:36] <masentinel900> Guys!!
[07:43:52] <Zepo> Hey Guys, If I reload a html-element with AJAX, the DOM/source do not refresh it's content too or ?
[07:44:14] <djQuery> fairuz, http://jsbin.com/wrapandroid/1/edit
[07:44:14] <masentinel900> Someone know why the log console show me an error  :: $.fancybox is not a function
[07:44:36] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/qRx9D/
[07:44:45] <masentinel900> This is my script!!
[07:45:22] <djQuery> mist likely the fancy box plugin is not being loaded for some reason
[07:45:37] <djQuery> masentinel900, is it listed AFTER jquery?
[07:45:40] <Zepo> Correction, the DOM refreshes but the source not... Well, the problem I have is I am using a JQuqery plugin for my selectbox that implements a little search bar into the select and it does not refresh it's content after the select reloads.
[07:46:45] <djQuery> Zepo, so the searchbar is supposed to be psycic as to when you added a select to the page after you initialized it?
[07:47:47] <Zepo> djQuery: What ? uuhh... more like... I want to refresh the JQuery Script that it reload's it data and I don't know how.
[07:48:38] <djQuery> Zepo,how are you loading the new html
[07:48:52] <masentinel900> djQuery:  http://pastebin.com/aE5Jkcpu
[07:49:02] <masentinel900> That is the structure of my file
[07:50:39] <Zepo> http://pastebin.com/wkGpfxkg
[07:50:49] <djQuery> masentinel900, don't like semicolons huh
[07:51:25] <jonez> djQuery, I fixed it. I made a new var and passed that to my anonymous function and it started to work.
[07:52:12] <masentinel900> What semicolons?
[07:52:21] <djQuery> masentinel900, exactly
[07:52:39] <djQuery> masentinel900, most likely this is not the correct path Js/jquery.fancybox.pack.js
[07:52:52] <djQuery> is that supposed to be JS/j....
[07:53:33] <Vill> Hi I'm experimenting with JQuery UI, especially the Draggable/Droppable feature. I'm stuck with project, where the markup looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/tDaRT/5/ and I need to Drag HOME or PROFILE into "Drop me here" box. On JSFiddle it's not working at all, at my own local project it is working, but when I try to drag it around, the Dragged DIV is not visible outside his parent DIV...
[07:53:35] <Vill> ...(when i drag it over the RED ZONE it is underneath). I've tried stack, zIndex, appendTo but nothing seems to help. Do you have any advice?
[07:55:51] <masentinel900> But in the console show me that all links are good loaded!
[07:56:41] <djQuery> masentinel900, console.log($.fn.fancybox)
[07:56:57] <djQuery> or whatever the plugin is called
[07:58:22] <Zepo> I dont really get it how to attack JQuery with .on() to refresh it after a AJAX Request
[07:58:32] <Zepo> attach
[07:59:49] <djQuery> ?paste@zepo
[07:59:50] <bot-t> zepo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:00:24] <NoiseEee> Zepo: you don't do anything with .on() after an ajax request.   you bind .on() to a parent element of the stuff you're loading in, so that the loaded-in stuff just starts working / calling the handlers you originally set
[08:01:04] <djQuery> Zepo, but that still wont fix your issue
[08:01:25] <djQuery> Zepo, here is how I did this with datepicker one time
[08:03:13] <Zepo> djQuery: Hm ?
[08:03:37] <djQuery> $(document).on('focus', 'input[type="date-time"]:not(.dp)', function(){$(this).addClass('dp').datepicker();});
[08:07:10] <Zepo> I am... to derpressed to do more today, gonna fix this tommorrow... Thanks anyway.
[08:08:42] <djQuery> Zepo, success: function(data){ $('.somediv').html(data.results).find('select').searchbarplugin();}

[08:09:11] <flapz> I need the name of a coresponding event where it fires when the input box gains focus (rather than leaves focus).

[08:22:00] <Vill> Hello, is here anyone from Official Support of JQuery UI?
[08:22:40] <sacho> there's no such thing.

[08:23:03] <Vill> The official IRC support channel is #jquery on irc.freenode.net. For discussions about development of jQuery UI, join the #jqueryui-dev channel.
[08:23:19] <sacho> hm, there's commercial support, but I doubt they hang out here.
[08:23:56] <pachet> you're most likely to get answered here
[08:24:01] <Zepo> djQuery: http://pastebin.com/FLBfqw1Q So here is the main thing I currently use for the thinks I have. How can I reload the   $(".ufd").searchable(); after the AJAX fired ?
[08:24:04] <pachet> which isnt to say you're extremely likely
[08:25:18] <Vill> pachet, I already asked a question, but there wasn't too much interest in it, rather to say, no interest, so that's why I'm asking if there is Official Support Dude,
[08:29:12] <Vill> pachet, I'm experimenting with JQuery UI, especially the Draggable/Droppable feature. I'm stuck with project, where the markup looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/tDaRT/5/ and I need to Drag HOME or PROFILE into "Drop me here" box. On JSFiddle it's not working at all, at my own local project it is working, but when I try to drag it around, the Dragged DIV is not visible outside his parent...
[08:29:13] <Vill> ...DIV (when i drag it over the RED ZONE it is underneath). I've tried stack, zIndex, appendTo but nothing seems to help. Do you have any advice?
[08:29:38] <rodrigograca31_> Hi :)
[08:30:01] <pachet> Vill: lemme take a look
[08:30:07] <jonez> didiergm, http://pastebin.com/t4tPvQQm <-- works perfectly
[08:30:14] <rodrigograca31_> justg a quick question
[08:30:14] <sacho> where are wow1 and wow2?
[08:30:23] <rodrigograca31_> jquery is case sensitive right?
[08:30:52] <rodrigograca31_> preventDefault() is diferent from preventdefault() right?
[08:32:06] <pachet> Vill: i dont see either of the #wow elements
[08:32:12] <pachet> oh, sacho beat me to it
[08:32:24] <sacho> he actually means #home and #profile etc
[08:32:29] <sacho> (judging from his explanation)
[08:32:35] <pachet> rodrigograca31_: jquery is case sensitive because javascript is case sensitive
[08:32:35] <systemfault> rodrigograca31_: JavaScript is indeed
[08:32:46] <pachet> sacho: oh
[08:33:17] <Vill> http://jsfiddle.net/tDaRT/8/ That was before update, 8 is current fork
[08:33:19] <rodrigograca31_> Ok, thanks :)
[08:34:22] <sacho> Vill, you need to make a clone of the draggable
[08:34:54] <Vill> but it doesn't persist any of the orgin element's CSS
[08:35:50] <pibu2> ... hello all ... I do not know if anyone can help me ... I have a problem with jquery file upload ... I've tried for two days to find a solution ... but I could not ... there is someone who can help me ?... thanks
[08:35:51] <sacho> dhwell, I must admit I haven't used jquery ui's draggable/droppable, but from what I can see happening, you'd need to make a clone to show the "movement" and relocate the original element via the droppable
[08:35:54] * sacho looks into it
[08:37:19] <masentinel900> Guys still continue with the problem
[08:37:50] <masentinel900> show me the error log  ::  $.fancybox is not a function
[08:38:09] <masentinel900> Someone could to help me?
[08:41:38] <pibu2> ... I can explain my problem?
[08:41:39] <sacho> well this is a major wtf
[08:42:04] <sacho> Vill, http://jsfiddle.net/Kw9jV/1/
[08:42:13] <sacho> Vill, your div had an id "#omg", not "omg"
[08:42:16] <Vill> oh, i was just writing responce
[08:43:16] <sacho> a lot of that shit is useless, i was just playing around
[08:43:16] <Vill> sacho, is dragging working for you in this Fiddle?
[08:43:36] <sacho> yup?
[08:43:40] <sacho> jsut drag the text "hello"
[08:43:56] <sacho> did you want to drag the tabs instead?
[08:44:13] <Vill> no, just hello, but I can't use it, i can't pick up the Home
[08:44:40] <pachet> what home
[08:44:57] <Vill> http://jsfiddle.net/Kw9jV/1/
[08:45:06] <Vill> pachet, updated version,
[08:45:08] <Einzig_> hello. I can't work out why it is complaining about a missing semicolon between 'click()' and the '{' http://pastebin.com/54CEWAyZ . Does anyone know why this fails?
[08:45:18] <sacho> yeah, because the draggable is bound to the text "hello", not to home
[08:45:44] <Vill> <facepalm>
[08:45:49] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[08:46:05] <pachet> ?paste @ Einzig_
[08:46:06] <bot-t> Einzig_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:46:11] <sacho> I wasn't sure what exactly you were trying to bind it to
[08:47:00] <Vill> sacho, thank you very much
[08:49:41] <Drager> Einzig_: http://pastebin.com/NWGmmrhy
[08:58:48] <mandark_> can anyone tell me why $(document).load doesn't work?  http://jsfiddle.net/qHLdk/
[08:59:37] <rmill> mandark_: You should be using document ready
[08:59:47] <systemfault> Because it's $(window).load IIRC
[08:59:48] <rmill> $(function(){});
[08:59:59] <rmill> And yea, window has the load event.
[09:00:01] <mandark_> but thats for when the window has rendered no?
[09:00:04] <mandark_> ah
[09:00:09] <mandark_> thanks systemfault
[09:00:12] <systemfault> But yeahâ€¦ You want the document ready
[09:00:18] <mandark_> stupid mistake
[09:00:24] <systemfault> mandark_: Use rmill's way if possible..
[09:00:37] <systemfault> .load happens late in the page's rendering
[09:00:42] <mandark_> i need to alter the dom before its rendered
[09:01:00] <systemfault> .load happens a few years after that.
[09:01:15] <mandark_> lol
[09:01:26] <rmill> yea...
[09:01:34] <mandark_> so the quickest possible way is document.ready ?
[09:01:48] * rmill nods
[09:01:56] <chilversc_> in jquery mobile, is there an attribute I can apply to a page to indicate that it always needs to be reloaded when displaying that page?
[09:02:18] <mandark_> i think im gna have to resort to Javascript for this one then
[09:02:23] <dzined> hipeeps
[09:02:30] <rmill> mandark_: An example: http://jsfiddle.net/qHLdk/1/
[09:02:52] <rmill> It helps to select jQuery from the dropdown when you make a fiddle ;)
[09:02:53] <dzined> http://pastie.org/6412911 - just wondering if someone can help with me with this, I'm a bit dump when its comes to js
[09:03:45] <dzined> i'm getting an error 'ctx is undefined
[09:03:49] <dzined> at line 69
[09:03:55] <systemfault> mandark_: The quickest way possible is putting the unwrapped code just after loading jquery in the <head>
[09:04:05] <dzined> i think its because the variable isn't being passed through to the function
[09:04:19] <dzined> but have tried all sorts  and can't fix it
[09:04:48] <chilversc_> I want to apply this to the page though rather than the link, and I still want to allow ajax laoding of the page, I just need it to be refetched from the server each time (ie, no caching of that specific page)
[09:04:55] <mandark_> rmill: point taken, thanks man
[09:06:55] <cambazz> hello, i do a var orig = l[key]; and sometimes orig is null
[09:07:09] <cambazz> i have to check if orig is null, so i make a orig.length
[09:07:18] <cambazz> which crashes for some reason
[09:07:41] <NoiseEee> cambazz: well check if its null?
[09:07:48] <NoiseEee> if something===null ?
[09:08:08] <Einzig_> Drager: thanks!
[09:10:31] <juboba> I'm having a problem with the droppable widget setting the greedy option to true. What happens is that I'm logging node.attr('id') + droppable.attr('id') and it logs twice (for the parent container and for the container I'm placing the node (draggable) to)
[09:10:41] <juboba> this should not happend setting greedy to true.
[09:10:52] <juboba> any ideas?
[09:10:59] <Drager> Einzig_: np
[09:15:50] <chinoto> well that was annoying... I knew about the difference between attributes and properties, but I thought that all attributes were copied to properties when the dom was loaded, apparently only some properties do that (eg id and value in some cases)
[09:15:52] <chinoto> $('[name]').map(function() {var $this=$(this),$closest=$this.closest('[id]');return [[$closest.attr('id'),$closest.prop('id'),$this.attr('name'),$this.prop('name')]]}).get()
[09:16:07] <chilversc_> hmm, jsbin won't let you edit the head
[09:16:36] <pythonsnake> i need to send to server a fail/succeed msg
[09:16:41] <pythonsnake> should i use $.post()?
[09:17:08] <chinoto> jsfiddle gets grumpy about that as well, with fiddle, you need to add scripts and such to the "External Resources" block
[09:17:44] <chinoto> pythonsnake: unless you have a reason not to use post, it seems like the logical way to go
[09:17:53] <chilversc_> so this is a short example, when going back from the second page I want it to reload the page from the server, http://jsbin.com/ubisum/1/
[09:18:22] <pachet> pythonsnake: $.post is just a convenience wrapper over $.ajax
[09:18:27] <pachet> and it doesnt scale well :[
[09:18:32] <pachet> i recommend using $.ajax
[09:18:54] <systemfault> What's wrong with $.post? :(
[09:18:59] <pythonsnake> ^^
[09:19:03] <chinoto> same question here...
[09:19:06] <systemfault> Beside that it wraps $.ajax.
[09:19:09] <chilversc_> pachet: since they added promises, I find post works fine
[09:19:17] <systemfault> chilversc: Same for me.
[09:19:19] <chilversc_> before promises handling errors was a pain
[09:19:33] <systemfault> chilversc: s/pain/impossible :P
[09:20:08] <pythonsnake> ok thanks
[09:20:15] <chinoto> and you can add as many promises as you want for the same event
[09:20:16] <didiergm> jonez glad it is sorted!
[09:20:24] <chilversc_> just doesn't seem to be a sensible way to tell jquery mobile to use ajax to reload a page everytime it's displayed
[09:21:17] <pythonsnake> i use .submit() and if it fails i use .post() to notify server
[09:21:21] <pythonsnake> does it seem logical?
[09:21:47] <chinoto> you mean for a form?
[09:22:01] <pythonsnake> yes
[09:22:05] <pythonsnake> jquery file upload
[09:22:31] <chilversc_> web-browsers should have a "report errors to" meta tag for logging
[09:22:32] <chinoto> is the form's submit server the same as the one being notified on errors?
[09:22:36] <systemfault> pythonsnake: If the initial submit is done with ajax, sure
[09:22:48] <xiphiasx_> question
[09:23:01] <xiphiasx_> i'm generating a <tr> with <td> on a page
[09:23:06] <pythonsnake> chilversc_: yes
[09:23:07] <xiphiasx_> when i leave that page
[09:23:11] <xiphiasx_> the data goes away
[09:23:14] <xiphiasx_> i do not want this to happen
[09:23:37] <chinoto> pythonsnake: I think the user should be notified if anything
[09:23:39] <juboba> does anybody know about droppable that can help me with my question please?
[09:23:41] <pythonsnake> systemfault: .submit
[09:23:48] <pythonsnake> so i guess it's ajax? lol
[09:24:06] <pythonsnake> chinoto: yes
[09:24:11] <pachet> chilversc_, chinoto, systemfault: i just still find myself using a lot of parameters that arent exposed to .post
[09:24:16] <pythonsnake> for that server needs to be notified before chinoto
[09:24:17] <pachet> dataFilter, global, etc
[09:24:18] <systemfault> pythonsnake: It "can" beâ€¦ .submit() triggers the submit eventâ€¦ how you actually handle that event is yours to decide
[09:24:32] <systemfault> pachet: Ahh ok :)
[09:24:55] <chinoto> pachet: then there isn't any problem with $.post(), when you need more functionality you use the base function
[09:26:09] <pachet> i'm not saying there's anything wrong with it, i just said i recommended using the base to begin with
[09:26:12] <pachet> boils down to personal preference
[09:26:27] <pachet> easier to just add or remove props from a single obj argument in my opinion
[09:26:43] <pachet> also makes it so that you know the single xhr entrypoint throughout your code
[09:26:44] <systemfault> pachet: I personally only use $.ajax
[09:27:01] <pythonsnake> â”‚18:22:36  systemfault | pythonsnake: If the initial submit is done with ajax, sure
[09:27:03] <pythonsnake> i dont get it
[09:28:15] <systemfault> pythonsnake: How are you going to log a failed submit if the page changes while it does it?
[09:29:06] <pythonsnake> systemfault: how?
[09:29:19] <pythonsnake> systemfault: wait
[09:29:30] <pythonsnake> using jquery file upload
[09:29:32] <chilversc_> pythonsnake: though if the server fails to submit, the server can log the error anyway?
[09:29:42] <pythonsnake> chilversc_: yes
[09:29:59] <pythonsnake> systemfault: i got an error/failure callback
[09:30:08] <pythonsnake> so each time an error occurs it is called
[09:30:21] <pythonsnake> but i need to notify the server about the failure too
[09:30:34] <chinoto> I don't see how notifying the server that the server didn't respond could work because that means there is already something wrong with the server
[09:30:43] <didiergm> is it still advisable to put js scripts at the bottom of the html page so that the page loads and starts rendering faster ?
[09:30:58] <systemfault> didiergm: Yeah
[09:31:14] <didiergm> systemfault thanks
[09:31:24] <systemfault> didiergm: Some people prefer to add them in the <head>Â so that's why the document ready even exists..
[09:32:01] <pibu2> sorry ... is there anyone who can give me a hand? :)
[09:32:17] <chinoto> not without information
[09:32:18] <pachet> ?ask
[09:32:19] <b-ot> pachet: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[09:32:32] <pachet> dueling bots
[09:33:03] <chinoto> I believe some w3c standard states that scripts belong in the head, though it doesn't seem to be a strict requirement in the least
[09:33:30] <pythonsnake> got an idea
[09:33:31] <chinoto> or maybe that was css
[09:33:34] <didiergm> systemfault true and that's whqt I normally do but wondering if I could shave off (or pretend to) a bit of time. Not quite sure if head load sequentially or in parallel
[09:33:36] <pythonsnake> thanks everyone!
[09:34:14] <pachet> didiergm: scripts in the head will be executed before the dom is fully parsed
[09:34:19] <pibu2> I have a problem with jquery file upload ... the files are uploaded ... but I get the message ... Empty file upload result ...
[09:34:26] <pachet> so if the script takes a long time to load, you'll sit at a blank page for a while
[09:34:43] <pachet> sometimes that's a good thing though, so
[09:36:01] <dzine> hello for some reason my jquery library hosted by google is not loading. what can be the cause?
[09:36:51] <dualcore> dzine: what link are you using
[09:37:21] <BillCriswell> dzine: If you have the type attribute on there make sure its value is "text/javascript"
[09:37:32] <dzine> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:37:40] <BillCriswell> I had text/javascpt one time and it ruined my day.
[09:37:50] <dzine> this is what is written in bootstrap
[09:38:05] <BillCriswell> dzine: Sounds like weird browser settings
[09:38:22] <dualcore> dzine: are you using any other js libraries?
[09:38:23] <dzine> im using google chrome
[09:38:32] <BillCriswell> Are you using file:// or some local server jawn?
[09:38:56] <dualcore> yea dzine why do you have // in front?
[09:39:01] <dualcore> try http:// instead
[09:39:13] <dzine> thats whats written in bootstrap
[09:39:15] <BillCriswell> dualcore: That allows you to switch to https automatically when it's needed.
[09:39:22] <BillCriswell> dzine: That's fine.
[09:39:23] <dualcore> oh hmm
[09:39:27] <systemfault> dzine: It should work just fine.
[09:39:55] <BillCriswell> dzine: Without code it would be impossible to figure this out.
[09:40:02] <dzine> GET file://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js
[09:40:06] <dzine> with an x
[09:40:11] <pachet> try adding : in front of the //
[09:40:13] <pachet> ://path
[09:40:33] <dzine> im using the initialzr html5bp with bootstrap
[09:40:55] <systemfault> Hmm, perhaps not if he's editing a local file, never tried it.
[09:41:33] <dzine> yes its a local file
[09:41:41] <systemfault> dzine: Use web server..
[09:41:43] <systemfault> PLEASE>
[09:41:51] <dzine> oh ok
[09:41:55] <dzine> thats why
[09:41:56] <dzine> thanks
[09:41:57] <pachet> blerh
[09:42:05] <systemfault> dzine: Do you have PHP 5.4 on your system?
[09:42:16] <pachet> sometimes i feel like im spraying a burning house with a gasoline hose
[09:42:22] <systemfault> If so, you don't even need a apache or whatever web server
[09:42:38] <dzine> oh ok
[09:42:49] <dzine> thanks
[09:55:21] <darkfrog> has the syntax of Dialog buttons changed since 1.9.1?  I'm trying to follow the example here: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation but the functions for each of my buttons is being invoked immediately and nothing is being shown in the buttons (in 1.9.1)
[09:55:26] <codeshah> hey guys, I am looking for a good jQuery plugin to drop in a form, have a user submit something then have the form drop out againâ€¦ I have a link called "SUBMIT ITEMS" and when the user clicks it, I want the form to drop in ..
[09:55:40] <codeshah> what's sort of the jquery plugin / scripts directory :)
[09:55:48] <codeshah> where I can browse / look for this
[09:58:12] <ascorbic> codeshah: Is that not .show() and .hide()?
[10:01:14] <NoiseEee> does jquery provide magic for getting an object key by value, or is that still up to me to write?
[10:10:34] <juboba> Can somebody help me with this? http://146.83.199.100/~juboba/public/config.html I have a folder structure and the files and folders can be dragged and dropped inside folders. My problem is that if I drop inside a inner folder the event propagates (as can be seen in firebug)
[10:10:39] <xiphiasx_> hi
[10:10:41] <juboba> to the father
[10:12:00] <xiphiasx_> http://pastie.org/private/toyxueknxomk3zpjcsna
[10:12:04] <xiphiasx_> i don't know why
[10:12:11] <xiphiasx_> but this.update() doesn't work
[10:12:17] <xiphiasx_> this.remainder changes
[10:12:21] <xiphiasx_> but it doesn't update on the screen
[10:13:53] <juboba> any ideas?
[10:18:13] <andrew9184> NoiseEee: for ecma5, you can use forEach
[10:18:27] <NoiseEee> andrew9184: yeah i wound up writing one mysqld :)
[10:18:42] <andrew9184> mysqld, thats a new one :D
[10:18:54] <NoiseEee> fuck
[10:19:02] <NoiseEee> i can't even write the word "myself" anymore, been about 2 years
[10:19:08] <NoiseEee> hands just do their own thing
[10:19:25] <andrew9184> lol
[10:20:09] <nnnad> hello .. i'm using "load()" to load html into specific parts of my page when clicking on a link, but when i do so, it scrolls down to the bottom of the page (due to long html response) .. how can I avoid or control that ?
[10:21:18] <nnnad> i tried with ajax + html() on my node, but i have the same problem
[10:22:08] <andrew9184> maybe detach the object and then attach it back with the attached content ?
[10:22:54] <nnnad> andrew9184: how can i detach it ? with a "remove" ?
[10:23:29] <andrew9184> $.detach
[10:23:56] <nnnad> andrew9184: ok, i'll give it a try
[10:24:03] <andrew9184> you could also try to hack around it by restricting the body to scroll with overflow
[10:24:10] <andrew9184> and then add it back on the complete callback
[10:28:10] <nnnad> andrew9184: thanks, i'll try that too
[10:29:24] <mads-> Hi. Is there a way for me to do "execute this once in 0.5 seconds?"
[10:33:30] <systemfault> setTimeout(function() { codeHere(); }, 500)
[10:38:16] <ckoning> Do the versions of jquery and jquery-ui match? In particular, is jquery-ui 1.9 compatible with jquery 1.9?
[10:38:22] <BenKxK> hey guys, I have a form and I want to fill a city field based on the areas code of the post code. How can I use Ajax to do this?
[10:39:17] <ckoning> @BenKxK That is not a trivial task
[10:39:32] <BenKxK> ckoning I have not used ajax befor
[10:39:32] <BenKxK> e
[10:39:40] <BenKxK> I know the syntax
[10:39:46] <BenKxK> let me try first lol
[10:41:21] <ckoning> BenKxK: It's not just the syntax, you need a database of zipcodes and their cities, you need to write a script to look up the city by zip code, you need to write the $.ajax() call to interact with your script, and some code to monitor the focus of the zip field, call the ajax function, and update the city field
[10:43:08] <BenKxK> ckoning: I have the database, and know the code to get the focus and update it, was jus the calling of ajax I was unfamiliar with, especially using a framework
[10:43:28] <andrew9184> use $.get
[10:43:34] <g0z> I'm looking for an image cropper widget that also works reasonably on touch devices, any tips? I have several that work well in browsers but touch stuff, eh.
[10:43:45] <andrew9184> g0z: try jCrop
[10:45:41] <karstenk1977_> what is better than .parent().parent().parent().parent()  ??
[10:45:48] <g0z> the drag handles on these type of croppers don't work well on touch devices in my experience unfortunately.
[10:45:50] <andrew9184> closest()
[10:45:58] <karstenk1977_> thx
[10:46:39] <andrew9184> g0z: i used touchpunch with it and it worked well
[10:46:45] <g0z> I have one that works ok on touch devices but doesn't support ratio changes
[10:46:59] <g0z> touchpunh ok let me google that
[10:47:59] <g0z> ah I see
[10:48:57] <xiphiasx_> hi
[10:48:59] <xiphiasx_> http://jsfiddle.net/NuZGC/2/
[10:49:01] <xiphiasx_> "DECREMENT" isn't working
[10:52:48] <andrew9184> item[0] == id is never matching
[10:55:16] <goddard> how do you pass json objects over ajax?
[10:55:53] <systemfault> From client to server?
[10:56:02] <systemfault> Or the opposite
[10:56:54] <blueadept> xiphiasx_: i think live has been depricated
[10:57:11] <blueadept> should use .on('click', '.classname', fun(){})
[10:57:19] <xiphiasx_> alright
[10:57:30] <blueadept> although that may not be your problme, just saw that right away
[10:57:59] <blueadept> let me look
[10:58:05] <systemfault> .live is more than deprecatedâ€¦ it's simply not available anymore.
[10:58:12] <systemfault> .live is dead
[10:58:13] <blueadept> ^
[10:59:45] <goddard> I am wanting to request data from my own server with ajax and I want to return a json object and then parse that and fill a div properly with all the json data
[11:01:30] <systemfault> goddard: So you want to return json from the server, right?
[11:01:42] <goddard> systemfault: yes
[11:01:51] <systemfault> goddard: What is your server-side language?
[11:01:55] <goddard> php
[11:02:19] <systemfault> Then you'd set the proper header using the header functionâ€¦ Content-Type: application/json
[11:02:30] <systemfault> And then you would echo json_encode(yourArray);
[11:02:58] <goddard> alright
[11:03:34] <mstenta> I'm trying to disable a form submit button using jQuery like this: $([my submit]).attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[11:03:47] <mstenta> It works in Chrome, but not in Firefox or IEâ€¦ any idea why?
[11:04:24] <mstenta> In Firefox's "Inspect Element", the 'disabled' attribute doesn't get added to the element.
[11:04:35] <systemfault> mstenta: It should work everywhere even though you shoudl be using .prop('disabled', true);
[11:04:53] <mstenta> systemfault: yea, unfortunately the site has jquery < 1.6
[11:05:07] <mstenta> systemfault: hm. i wonder why this isn't working then...
[11:05:13] <systemfault> Hmm
[11:05:21] <mstenta> can i post a link?
[11:05:26] <systemfault> Yeah
[11:05:31] <mstenta> http://www.nysquash.com/events/test-event-2099-jul-01
[11:05:36] <mstenta> It's the "Sign Up" button in the right column
[11:05:51] <mstenta> it creates a popup dialog, and should be disabling the actual "Sign Up" submit button
[11:06:04] <mstenta> it works in Chrome, but not Firefox (and the client said also IE)
[11:06:37] <mstenta> but you can see, as soon as you click "Sign Up", the page starts redirecting
[11:06:57] <andrew9184> whats the problem here ?
[11:07:00] <mstenta> systemfault: hmmâ€¦ i wonder if it's because I'm adding the attribute on the button's click() event
[11:07:21] <mstenta> systemfault: maybe it's a race conditionâ€¦ the click submits the form before it can be disabled
[11:07:35] <blueadept> xiphiasx_: http://jsfiddle.net/NuZGC/30/
[11:07:53] <systemfault> mstenta: Possible, the way you're doing that is a bit strange to me
[11:08:11] <blueadept> xiphiasx_: you need to be careful with scope, there are ways of passing scope to within jquery's each function
[11:08:15] <blueadept> take a look
[11:08:20] <mstenta> systemfault: yeaâ€¦ that makes sense now that i think about itâ€¦ i don't need to be disabling it on clickâ€¦ i can do it before hand
[11:08:24] <mstenta> systemfault: i'll test that out
[11:09:46] <Drager> I'm trying to make a "Preview post" with jquery and I do it like this; http://jsfiddle.net/EcfeR/ works but it's buggy if you spam the tabs. Any ideas?
[11:10:54] <mstenta> systemfault: hmm. well that prevents the button from being clicked at all now.
[11:11:00] <mstenta> :-/
[11:11:21] <systemfault> mstenta: What do you want to do exactlyâ€¦ What is supposed to happen?
[11:11:37] <systemfault> You have a form with a sign up button..
[11:12:13] <systemfault> Then if you click on sign-up, you get a disclaimerâ€¦ so until you agree, you cannot proceed further, right?
[11:12:25] <mstenta> systemfault: right
[11:12:35] <systemfault> So, forget the "click" event
[11:12:37] <mstenta> systemfault: but clicking "Sign Up" submits the form in Firefox
[11:13:11] <systemfault> You need to bind yourself to the submit event of the formâ€¦ and until some condition is true, the form would prevent itself from being sent with e.preventDefault();
[11:13:25] <mstenta> systemfault: ah...
[11:13:50] <mstenta> systemfault: that makes sense
[11:14:20] <goddard> systemfault: any idea why when I set the value of a text area with ajax data it just says [object Object]
[11:14:49] <systemfault> goddard: Because jQuery parses the JSON you get from the server into an object
[11:14:57] <systemfault> goddard: Which is the usual usage of JSON
[11:15:44] <goddard> systemfault: oh so it worked as it was suppose to
[11:15:54] <systemfault> Probably
[11:16:03] <systemfault> console.log that object to see its content
[11:16:53] <goddard> systemfault: yeah it was all there as a json object should look
[11:17:30] <systemfault> JSON is just a stringâ€¦ and when you parse it, you get a standard javascript object
[11:18:08] <mstenta> systemfault: thanks that worked!  sometimes you just need to talk something through for it to make more sense :-)
[11:18:34] <systemfault> :D
[11:19:07] <mstenta> systemfault: is there an easy way to test if an element exists?
[11:19:41] <systemfault> mstenta: Hmm, just try to select it :(
[11:19:42] <mstenta> systemfault: i need to check to see if a checkbox exists, and then check to see if it's checked before allowing submissionâ€¦ but there are two possible checkboxes, and it may be one or the other, or both that are displayed
[11:20:15] <mstenta> systemfault: so i need to say "does this checkbox exist and is it checked"?
[11:20:40] <systemfault> mstenta: Can you do anything when you click on that checkbox?
[11:20:52] <systemfault> If so, you could add a value on the form object
[11:21:09] <systemfault> $('#myForm').data('agreed', true); //something like that
[11:21:10] <mstenta> systemfault: mm that's another thought...
[11:21:23] <mstenta> systemfault: i'll give that a try, thanks!
[11:22:02] <superdo> hi
[11:22:26] <superdo> how to loop the two array item in the following object? http://hastebin.com/xokedegeme.tex
[11:23:02] <systemfault> It's the jquery channel here, no PHP :(
[11:23:12] <superdo> with jquery , sorry
[11:23:26] <superdo> a getJSON gets the above data
[11:26:49] <priyanshu_> jquery not serailizing forms data correctly
[11:27:09] <systemfault> superdo: I'd be surprisedâ€¦ and what field would you want to access?
[11:27:21] <superdo> title, content
[11:27:31] <superdo> they are articles
[11:28:13] <superdo> as you see in "content" there are two array items
[11:28:46] <systemfault> You could use $.each(myObject['content'], function() { var element = this; doSomethingWithElement(); });
[11:29:00] <BillCriswell> haskell makes me feel like... insanely bad at programming.
[11:29:03] <superdo> checking..
[11:29:08] <priyanshu_> http://paste.debian.net/240359/
[11:29:50] <priyanshu_> need help
[11:30:26] <priyanshu_> can someone help me
[11:31:48] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: Begging isn't the best way to ask for help.
[11:31:56] <BillCriswell> What are you trying to accomplish?
[11:32:09] <priyanshu_> http://paste.debian.net/240359/
[11:32:28] <priyanshu_> added an ajax code to serialize some form
[11:34:27] <priyanshu_> billcriswell: i made a script to serialize  forms data thru ajax request
[11:34:45] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: You wasted a lot of time. =)
[11:35:22] <BillCriswell> Oh, you're just using .serialize()
[11:35:29] <priyanshu_> you really think so
[11:35:51] <pachet> its a question of semantics
[11:36:21] <pachet> i made a script to serialize vs i made a script that serializes, maybe
[11:36:33] <priyanshu_> billcriswell: in this file http://paste.debian.net/240363/ added that code whose forms data needs to be serialized
[11:36:38] <BillCriswell> pachet: It makes sense now haha.
[11:36:46] <pachet> :]
[11:38:06] <priyanshu_> form starts from line number 49
[11:38:07] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: I'm a little lost to be honest. What's the problem with your javascript?
[11:39:19] <priyanshu_> when i use firebug to catch the problem but the errors just flicks for a second
[11:40:02] <pachet> look at the actual firefox error console
[11:40:07] <pachet> those persist between requests
[11:40:24] <priyanshu_> specfically in the form line number 112 there is input field of type checkbox which is not serializing
[11:41:05] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: Does it have a value attribute?
[11:41:16] <BillCriswell> and a name?
[11:41:18] <priyanshu_> no
[11:41:22] <priyanshu_> used name and id
[11:42:20] <BillCriswell> try adding a value.
[11:42:58] <BillCriswell> I'm also assuming redify_homepage_slider is a form?
[11:44:08] <priyanshu_> yes
[11:44:25] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:44:30] <BillCriswell> I think your checkbox just needs a value.
[11:45:05] <priyanshu_> when whole ajax request done i am redirected to some other page instead of from whener i calle dthe ajax request
[11:45:43] <priyanshu_> from where i called the ajax request
[11:47:15] <priyanshu_> billcriswell: here is the checkbox code http://paste.debian.net/240367/
[11:49:09] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: If you're running the script on submit before sure to use the event and do event.preventDefault().
[11:49:20] <BillCriswell> submit, be sure to*
[11:49:27] <BillCriswell> Stupid brain.
[11:51:11] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: Also, if a checkbox isn't checked it won't be serialized.
[11:51:12] <priyanshu_> how can i trac in console which error is coming
[11:51:33] <priyanshu_> its already checked
[11:52:13] <BillCriswell> Are you doing it when you submit a form?
[11:53:22] <priyanshu_> running an event onclick inside the form which call that js script
[11:53:44] <priyanshu_> which in turn send the ajax request to the form
[11:54:26] <BillCriswell> onclick on a submit button?
[11:54:46] <systemfault> Nobody really want that.
[11:54:54] <systemfault> They think they doâ€¦.
[11:54:58] <systemfault> But they don't
[11:55:01] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Truth.
[11:55:31] <systemfault> Because attaching an onclick to the submit button seems like the most intuitive thing to do :P
[11:56:27] <ddsss> I know one can enable timezone selection in datepicker via setting showTimezone: true, -but why is selected dimezone not shown in textbox?
[11:56:33] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: $('form').on('submit', function(e){ // Handle submit! } ); is preferable to $('button').on('click', function(){ // Handle submit } );
[11:56:40] <StephenS> $('mula')
[11:56:58] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I remember going through that mind set.
[11:57:26] <goddard> in my ajax response I get a large object with "success" "responseText" and a bunch of other stuff... how can I only grab the responseText?
[11:57:57] <priyanshu_> code for the submit i used is <input type="submit" class="button-primary"  value= "<?php _e('Save Changes', 'redify');?>" onclick="datasave_slider()"/>
[11:58:09] <BillCriswell> goddard: What kind of data is the response?
[11:58:21] <goddard> BillCriswell: it is json
[11:58:31] <goddard> BillCriswell: the responseText is json
[11:59:03] <priyanshu_> and that submit is placed in  <form method="post" action = "" style="width:751px;" id="redify_homepage_slider">
[11:59:09] <superdo> systemfault, my fault, i left php debug code on, so my jquery log was a crap :/
[11:59:32] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: You want onsubmit on the form, not onclick on the submit button.
[11:59:37] <superdo> systemfault, the result was json data in array
[11:59:42] <NoiseEee> priyanshu_: also its time to leave inline JS behind, far far behind.
[12:00:18] <priyanshu_> bill: wait i will try this
[12:00:48] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: As NoiseEee said, you shouldn't be putting those inline.
[12:01:30] <BillCriswell> goddard: So do like, responseText.property
[12:02:00] <priyanshu_> yah that i will correct once this thing works onsubmit working same as onclic
[12:02:29] <goddard> BillCriswell: i have var ajaxResponse.responseText.property and it fails
[12:02:59] <BillCriswell> goddard: Can you paste your code somewhere?
[12:03:11] <BillCriswell> I feel like I'm just not following you without code to see hah
[12:03:13] <goddard> BillCriswell: it says undefined
[12:03:17] <goddard> ok
[12:04:29] <BillCriswell> priyanshu_: http://jsbin.com/uxapuk/1/edit might help clear it up a bit
[12:09:00] <priyanshu_> hey how can i add breakpoints so that i can trac each step
[12:09:08] <priyanshu_> in firebug
[12:09:42] <goddard> BillCriswell: when i write my object to the console with console.log this is what I get http://pastebin.com/gQK3XGVr
[12:11:43] <BillCriswell> goddard: Are you using $.get, $.ajax?
[12:12:23] <masentinel900> Guys!!
[12:12:29] <masentinel900> a question!
[12:12:53] <masentinel900> Can I to call simply a div with fancybox?
[12:13:11] <goddard> BillCriswell: it is a custom function .ajaxCall
[12:13:24] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/rEguB/
[12:13:26] <systemfault> masentinel900 There's a verb or something missing in that sentence..
[12:13:53] <goddard> BillCriswell: that is why i am having so much difficulty with it haha
[12:13:57] <goddard> BillCriswell: I didn't write it
[12:13:57] <BillCriswell> masentinel900: You can like to #divid I think.
[12:14:14] <systemfault> masentinel900: You can show the content of a hidden div with fancybox if that's what you need
[12:14:18] <masentinel900> So, Instead href to call a complete page just I call a div
[12:14:41] <BillCriswell> You can LINK to #divid I think.
[12:14:50] <systemfault> masentinel900: I do it all the time.
[12:14:54] <masentinel900> systemfault: Yes But I can show it in a fancybox window
[12:15:05] <systemfault> masentinel900: Exactlyâ€¦ I do that all the time.
[12:15:46] <priyanshu_> bill: thnx
[12:15:55] <BillCriswell> goddard: It's hard to help without seeing the function.
[12:16:04] <masentinel900> Like this ::  href            : '#viewDescripSector',
[12:16:33] <priyanshu_> bill: i got the bug actually inpyt type="button" to be used but i have type="submit"
[12:17:25] <BillCriswell> goddard:  I assume the success is called like function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) ?
[12:17:25] <goddard> BillCriswell: I showed the output of the object
[12:17:44] <goddard> but i am unsure how to parse the data
[12:19:43] <blueadept> anyone here use browserify?
[12:20:23] <BillCriswell> goddard: So result.responseText isn't the data you want?
[12:20:34] <Zzaichik> I actually am using browserify
[12:21:02] <goddard> BillCriswell: it returns undefined
[12:23:30] <BillCriswell> goddard: No sure. Seeing the actual script would help.
[12:25:43] <goddard> BillCriswell: is the object not just a standard object?
[12:26:09] <BillCriswell> It looks like it. I see responseText in there, not sure where you can't do whatever.responseText
[12:26:48] <goddard> BillCriswell: ya this sucks
[12:34:33] <gotwig> dblosevn: care to help me with a selector.. again?
[12:34:57] <gotwig> basicly my current not working selector is this: $(".gridlevel, p, #" + id").remove();
[12:34:58] <karstenk1977_> how can I bind an event mouseenter where the function only starts when a special time is over?
[12:35:07] <karstenk1977_> delay isnÂ´t the right
[12:35:30] <gotwig> I want to select a whole .gridlevel class, with help of an id, in a p tag, that is part of that class
[12:35:54] <gotwig> oh... and I want to go for the attribute...
[12:38:16] <gotwig> here is my code
[12:38:22] <gotwig> please take a look : http://jsfiddle.net/Ae5RZ/
[12:43:33] <djQuery> gotwig, this isn't that anymore
[12:44:00] <gotwig> djQuery: what?
[12:44:46] <masentinel900> How can I open a div inside fancybox window?
[12:44:50] <djQuery> gotwig, http://jsfiddle.net/Ae5RZ/1/
[12:47:26] <djQuery> masentinel900, by reading its docs

[12:48:09] <samholmes> It would be cool to be able to write Jade inline with jQuery instead of HTML.
[12:49:04] <darcyclarke> shanejonas noob :P
[12:50:35] <gerep> Hi all
[12:50:38] <djQuery> ?g jquery jade plugin
[12:50:40] <b-ot> djQuery: jquery-placeholder-plugin/src/index.jade at master Â· andrewrjones ... â†’ https://github.com/andrewrjones/jquery-placeholder-plugin/blob/master/src/index.jade
[12:50:40] <bot-t> djQuery, jquery-placeholder-plugin/src/index.jade at master · andrewrjones ... - https://github.com/andrewrjones/jquery-placeholder-plugin/blob/master/src/index.jade
[12:50:52] <gerep> I'm doing this to change the disable enable attr of my input: $("#"+object).attr("disabled", !$("#"+object).attr("disabled"))
[12:50:52] <djQuery> samholmes, ^^^^^
[12:51:08] <systemfault> gerep: That's bad
[12:51:22] <gerep> it is working great, now I'm trying to use the same logic, one line to make my input display: inline, display: none, any ideas on how to do that in one line?
[12:51:32] <gerep> so I don't need to use conditions?
[12:51:35] <systemfault> gerep: As long as you have a "disabled" attribute, it will stay disabled, the value of it is meaninless
[12:51:47] <gerep> systemfault, what is the best way to do that?
[12:51:56] <systemfault> gerep: You use .prop instead
[12:52:21] <systemfault> gerep: with .prop, you set/get a boolean
[12:52:50] <gerep> systemfault, but in the case o display (no boolean) how can I do that check in one line?
[12:53:29] <bytephilia> How would you suggest I change my code so that the content slides closer to each other (so you can see both content items some point in the transition) http://ej.is/ (press info sign)
[12:53:30] <systemfault> gerep: Not sure I understand :/
[12:54:15] <gerep> systemfault, using .prop, I can set a true/false to any attribute ok?
[12:54:38] <djQuery> gerep, var $obj = $('#'+object); ($obj.prop('disabled'))?$obj.removeProp('disabled'):$obj.prop('disabled', 'disabled');
[12:55:35] <gerep> systemfault, in my example, I did that in one line of code, I'm trying to do the same but not with a boolean attribute. In this case, I'm trying to change the "display" attribute that do not accept a boolean, only "inline" and "none"
[12:57:15] <systemfault> gerep: You should create a class in CSS and use .toggleClass
[12:57:52] <gerep> systemfault, yeah, I thought of that but was trying to work only with jQuery but thanks for your time. Thanks to you too djQuery ;)
[12:58:25] <djQuery> gerep, var $obj = $('#'+object); ($obj.prop('disabled'))?$obj.removeProp('disabled'):$obj.prop('disabled', 'disabled');  $obj.toggleClass('hidden');
[12:59:23] <djQuery> gerep, or better yet  var $obj = $('#'+object).toggleClass('hidden'); ($obj.prop('disabled'))?$obj.removeProp('disabled'):$obj.prop('disabled', 'disabled');
[13:01:24] <systemfault> That's invalid :P
[13:05:40] <andrew9184> djQuery: what are you working on these days ?
[13:05:46] <tomasm-> hi, anyone know why load() is using GET even though there is data passed as the second parameter? via $('#FormName').serialize()
[13:05:50] <djQuery> nutn much
[13:06:33] <andrew9184> because $.load() is similar to $.get
[13:06:51] <andrew9184> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.7.2&fn=jQuery.fn.load
[13:07:42] <tomasm-> andrew9184, ok well seems that it needs an OBJECT to assume post. I may be giving a string, which I think what serialize() does
[13:08:04] <tomasm-> thanks
[13:08:09] <gotwig> $w.prop('id') can only be used with an id
[13:08:15] <gotwig> how can I use data instead?
[13:08:23] <gotwig> .data('id') does not work for me
[13:10:25] <djQuery> gotwig, <label id="test" data-id="1234" class="testing">test 1234</label>   $('.testing').attr('id') == test     $('.testing').data('id') == 1234
[13:10:33] <gotwig> I need data for only the first...
[13:10:39] <gotwig> .prop is used here to get only the first
[13:11:06] <gotwig> only the first matching element
[13:11:15] <djQuery> systemfault, what did I mess up there ?
[13:11:49] <systemfault> djQuery: $obj.prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[13:11:56] <systemfault> Anyway, not that important.
[13:12:11] <gotwig> So
[13:12:19] <gotwig> I replaced the id="data"
[13:12:22] <gotwig> with data-id="data"
[13:12:29] <gotwig> how can I get now the property into here?
[13:12:46] <Eviltwin> I thought it was .attr('disabled', 'disabled') / .attr('disabled', '') and .prop('disabled', true) and .prop('disabled', false)
[13:12:47] <gotwig> i can use data-id I guess as well...
[13:12:50] <gotwig> if that is a fine method?
[13:13:11] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: you didn't jquery-to did you?
[13:13:14] <gotwig> $w.prop('data-id') does not work
[13:13:27] <gotwig> btw, I am going to release my project as open source tomorrow
[13:13:31] <gotwig> thx for your help, as well
[13:13:37] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: ?
[13:13:51] <Eviltwin> The jQueryTO conference?
[13:13:53] <Eviltwin> I wasn't there
[13:13:54] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: did you make it up to JqueryTO
[13:14:14] <gotwig> so if I have $w.prop('id') to get the property of the first matched element for the id property
[13:14:22] <gotwig> how can I get the property for data-id ?
[13:14:42] <NoiseEee> gotwig: .attr('data-id')
[13:15:35] <gotwig> NoiseEee: no, doesnt work
[13:16:07] <NoiseEee> gotwig: whats your question exactly?
[13:16:15] <gotwig> NoiseEee: What I asked...
[13:16:25] <gotwig> I can show you all my source code if you like...
[13:16:31] <gotwig> as my project is going to be OSS, tomorrow...
[13:16:48] <NoiseEee> are you asking how to get or set the "data-id" value?
[13:16:51] <masentinel900> Oh my god!!, definitely cannot show the div in the fancybox  window!!
[13:17:15] <gotwig> NoiseEee: get the value
[13:17:19] <gotwig> http://pastebin.com/jcaxdCCe
[13:17:35] <gotwig> line 91
[13:17:48] <gotwig> dblosevn: ^ you did implement that for me :>
[13:18:11] <NoiseEee> gotwig: $w is an element?
[13:18:19] <gotwig> NoiseEee: the original worked thing was $w.prop('id')
[13:18:45] <NoiseEee> gotwig: $w is an element?
[13:18:51] <gotwig> NoiseEee: I dont know right now...
[13:19:06] <gotwig> that stuff here is based on www.gridster.net
[13:19:23] <veQue> imperfect action is better than perfect inaction
[13:20:01] <NoiseEee> gotwig: well good luck
[13:20:06] <gotwig> NoiseEee: lol, thx
[13:20:16] <gotwig> NoiseEee: I just wanted to clean my code  up
[13:20:34] <gotwig> NoiseEee: because in the past I used a lot of redunant id's and such
[13:20:35] <djQuery> gotwig, console.log($w);
[13:21:08] <gotwig> djQuery: wait, Dj
[13:22:35] <djQuery> gotwig, console.log($w[0].outerHTML);
[13:23:04] <djQuery> is id defined as id=   or is it defined as data-id=
[13:24:10] <gotwig> djQuery: it should work with data-id
[13:24:22] <gotwig> djQuery: when I use id, in the old way I get the following output
[13:24:24] <gotwig> wait
[13:24:24] <NoiseEee> gotwig: you seem to not quite understand what it is your code is doing?
[13:24:35] <gotwig> NoiseEee: yeah....
[13:24:37] <gotwig> dblosevn: ^
[13:24:52] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5594318/
[13:25:06] <gotwig> now I have both in, id and data-id
[13:25:08] <gotwig> but I want data-id only
[13:25:18] <gotwig> (to reduce redunant stuff)
[13:30:23] <gotwig> what ever
[13:30:27] <gotwig> I keep it like it is ;)
[13:30:31] <gotwig> thx
[13:31:43] <gotwig> I am going to put my project now on github
[13:31:50] <gotwig> I am hope it can help someone in need :)

[13:40:32] <motaka2> Hello what is this selector doing?  $("#egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm :input")
[13:41:22] <limpc> hmm anybody here using colorbox currently?  I have chrome v24.0.x and chrome v25.0.x, and it seems to crash v25
[13:41:36] <djQuery> motaka2, finding all inputs inside of something with the id of egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm
[13:41:38] <shoky> motaka2 what do you think?
[13:42:37] <motaka2> djQuery: Ah ok I guessed so but I have marked it to ask, I think I was wondering if there is a better selector for that
[13:42:56] <motaka2> shoky: whay not #form input ?
[13:43:14] <shoky> you mean why :input instead of input ?
[13:44:07] <limpc> this was verified on both linux and windows versions of chrome
[13:44:23] <djQuery> motaka2, input wont get select or textarea etc... see ?:input
[13:44:24] <bot-t> motaka2, :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[13:44:38] <NoiseEee> limpc: what version of jquery?
[13:44:47] <limpc> 1.9.1
[13:45:01] <NoiseEee> limpc: well i bet the plugin doesn't work with the latest/greatest
[13:45:15] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ @ limpc
[13:45:16] <motaka2> djQuery: Thank you I got that - :input includes butoons and textareas too
[13:45:20] <motaka2> thank you
[13:45:40] <gnarf> :input is also *:input
[13:45:44] <NoiseEee> limpc: you should be usign https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate for existing scripts updated to 1.9.x
[13:45:48] <gnarf> so beware, its slower
[13:46:26] <limpc> NoiseEee: huh? I dont maintain colorbox. and I started with 1.9.x
[13:47:03] <gnarf> colorbox might be using some bad code that needs to be updated for 1.9
[13:47:08] <NoiseEee> limpc: my point is that colorbox was written pre 1.9.x;  migrate will show you its issues so you can fix it.  or you can use an older version of jquery
[13:47:10] <limpc> NoiseEee: the odd thing is, it all works perfectly in chrome v24
[13:47:44] <shoky> examples on colorbox site use jquery 1.9.1
[13:47:45] <NoiseEee> limpc: give migrate a spin and see what warnings you get.  if you don't get any, come back here and we can investimiate further.
[13:47:51] <shoky> and it doesn't crash my chrome
[13:48:50] <shoky> im on 26 tho ;p
[13:50:14] <shoky> or did i misunderstand the issue?
[13:51:11] <NoiseEee> fwiw limpc, i'm on chrome linux 25 and have no issues with the demos either
[13:51:30] <limpc> NoiseEee: i dont get any warnings when i perform the actions which crashed chrome
[13:51:37] <sunbeam> anyone in here common with jquery datatables? how can I achieve that I can sort by all columns?
[13:53:21] <squishee> does anyone have a recommendation for a vector drawing and animation library? i found raphael, looks legit
[13:53:29] <squishee> (in javascript/jquery of course)
[13:53:45] <xiphiasx_> hi
[13:53:52] <xiphiasx_> let's say I add a table row
[13:54:03] <xiphiasx_> i want that table row to be on that page until I go to another page
[13:54:15] <xiphiasx_> if i switch pages
[13:54:17] <xiphiasx_> it goes away
[13:58:32] <nerk> so what is the question?
[14:00:15] <xiphiasx_> how does one preserve a <tr> that is added by jquery
[14:00:36] <xiphiasx_> page `p` has a <tr> added by jquery, upon switching to `p2` and back to `p`, it goes away
[14:00:39] <xiphiasx_> i don't want that happening
[14:00:46] <nerk> that's the nature of js
[14:00:57] <nerk> things dynamically added to the DOM
[14:01:02] <xiphiasx_> eh
[14:01:07] <nerk> will not get preserved when navigating between pages
[14:01:07] <xiphiasx_> i'm probably going to end up with localStorage
[14:01:31] <nerk> if you want it preserved, you will have to use a storage mechanism of some sort that will auto inject the tr back if the storage item exists
[14:01:50] <nerk> localStorage would work
[14:02:25] <nerk> secondly, if you handle the pages via ajax.. then you wont need storage.
[14:03:12] <nerk> but of course, that requires a bit of work.. creating a hash listener or historyStack to handle navigation.  show / hide pages or divs.. etc.
[14:03:51] <NoiseEee> xiphiasx_: just a heads up if you plan that to work on IE.
[14:04:18] <xiphiasx_> NoiseEee: yeah, i was afraid of that
[14:04:18] <illmat> i wrote a little content filter: http://jsfiddle.net/k6BPs/5/ , if i switch between "gfx" and "coding" for example i get this ugly height reseizing effect on the parent div
[14:04:37] <nerk> modernizer might add support in IE?
[14:04:40] <NoiseEee> xiphiasx_: and what about when you return to the page the next day?
[14:04:41] <illmat> can i prevent that somehow by fading in the new divs at the same place the old divs were
[14:04:43] <nerk> not sure.
[14:14:16] <StephenS> Is comet good for webchat, is it in the same rank as websockets
[14:23:27] <NoiseEee> StephenS: its was the answer before websockets.
[14:23:50] <StephenS> Ya I see, but I find hard to use websockets
[14:24:03] <StephenS> Ill stick with comet for now, as websockets are not available for every and anyone.
[14:24:14] <NoiseEee> you should figure out how to use node.js and socket.io, and let the transports take care of themselves.
[14:46:00] <shalotelli> guys check out my form builder created in jQuery and Bootstrap based on the one on bootsnip.com
[14:46:01] <shalotelli> https://github.com/shalotelli/form_builder
[14:51:04] <xiphiasx_> hi
[15:02:50] <shalotelli> created a page for it so you can see the demo
[15:02:50] <shalotelli> http://shalotelli.github.com/form_builder
[15:04:39] <dzine> pretty cool
[15:04:58] <dzine> shalotelli
[15:06:28] <shalotelli> thanks it was created as part of a project but i saw the usefulness of it stand alone and for other peoples projects so thought id make it public for everyone to benefit
[15:11:17] <nerk> shalotelli: I like it.. but it would be nice to control some of the finer things, style, input attributes, etc
[15:11:35] <nerk> I get that you can do that via source, but if you could build that into the gui, would be pretty rad.
[15:13:32] <shalotelli> I'm working on a version with more control but for the purposes for which it was intended (letting non technical users create simple questionnaires and web based forms as part of a bigger application) it does the job
[15:13:44] <shalotelli> thanks for the input!
[15:13:45] <shalotelli> nerk
[15:15:43] <clockman> I've got a problem with jQuery UI 1.10.1 - in each dialog box, the close window button is offset a little bit - http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=1h2joz&s=6 anyone know what could be causing this? all other images are perfectly placed
[15:17:30] <shiftins> clockman: could it be you need to cmd-0 (or ctrl-0) to reset the font-zoom size?
[15:17:37] <shiftins> otherwise not sure.. sry
[15:17:51] <clockman> nope, default zoom 100%.
[15:17:57] <coldhead> good effort shiftins
[15:17:57] <clockman> shrug. I'll try a different theme
[15:18:00] <coldhead> kudos to you
[15:26:51] <JValentin1> I'm trying to determine what the html element type is of whatever the mouse is hovering over when I move off of another element. The idea is to use a click even to toggle the class of a child UL so it appears, and then only toggle it off if the mouse is not hovering over that newly visible UL, or any of it's children. I'm firing the toggle on the mouseleave event of the top level element, which is an LI tag. How can I determine what the currently hover
[15:28:33] <AMcP> tagName
[15:28:35] <JValentin1> following this page, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3479849/jquery-how-do-i-get-the-element-underneath-my-cursor, I tried the solution, and it gives me a something like object HTMLHtmlElement, but I need to know if it's a UL or LI element
[15:30:07] <JValentin1> AMcP:  I tried tagname, but it comes back null
[15:30:29] <JValentin1> I tried {hoverElem = this.prop("tagName")}
[15:31:14] <mikerapin> do your UL's have a width/height?
[15:31:55] <jrabbit> $().replaceWith(fn) seems to be passing text not the jquery object to the function as the second arguement
[15:33:09] <JValentin1> mikerapin: no they don't
[15:33:31] <Eviltwin> jrabbit: The replaceWith function is given the index in the collection and the HTML contents of the element as arguments
[15:33:37] <Eviltwin> jrabbit: The element itself is accessable via "this"
[15:33:38] <ridicter> Hello all, when I use the JQuery 1.9 library, it breaks a slider on my WordPress website.  When I use the migrations, it works again.  However, this then breaks the AOL Video embeds.  Does anyone know a good way to find a solution?
[15:33:52] <jrabbit> Eviltwin: for some reason that doesn't seem documented?
[15:34:05] <Eviltwin> Yeah, only the "this" part is documented for whatever reason
[15:34:32] <jrabbit> thanks.
[15:34:36] <mikerapin> JValentin1 you may need to set both to ensure that when you hover you're not just hovering on the LI elements but the UL as well. unless you added your mouse events to the LI elements and checked for the parent UL
[15:38:32] <JValentin1> mikerapin: I may not have started this correctly, here's what I have, a <ulÂ class="tree">, then a <liÂ class="expanded">, then a <aÂ class="tree_trigger down"Â href="#"> My Menu</a>, then a <ulÂ class="submenu show"> that is hidden. My jquery is a $('.tree_trigger').click(function(), so it's firing on the a tag, and works great to toggle the child UL on clicking, but I want it to close if I move away from the menu, and then only if I am not over any o
[15:40:06] <mikerapin> so like $('.tree_trigger').mouseleave() ?
[15:41:34] <JValentin1> actually, no, I put it under the expanded element, like this :  $('.expanded').mouseleave(function() {
[15:42:19] <mikerapin> so the action of this is to click on the link to open the menu, then when you leave the li to close the menu?
[15:42:28] <mikerapin> (just for clarification)
[15:42:35] <newtonianb> I have a question about canvas to blob, is this compatible across browsers? Basically right now I upload my picture then am using jquery to replace my image src with the URL of the picture on the server so ti can be displayed. I'm thinking of instead of having to (upload) the picture then (redownload) for the image src to show it to just convert it to a blob https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScr
[15:42:36] <newtonianb> ipt-Canvas-to-Blob
[15:42:36] <newtonianb> <newtonianb> is that a bad idea?
[15:45:21] <JValentin1> mikerapin: yes, but only if you aren't anywhere over the menu or it's children, very much like a standard menu. The reason I don't use hover features is because I need to record the click of the top level link and maybe execute some other events
[15:46:26] <JValentin1> I guess I could set a page level event to find all (.tree) elements and toggle their classes
[15:47:56] <mikerapin> JValentin1 gotcha.
[15:48:16] <mikerapin> your page level event idea may work
[15:48:49] <mikerapin> otherwise, it seems like there's an issue with the ul element holding your menu
[15:49:04] <JValentin1> I was trying to keep everything in this one function and honestly not too sure what code to use
[16:19:29] <lenswipee> hi, the second link doesn't respond as i like, see http://jsfiddle.net/6bJnD/
[16:19:38] <lenswipee> doesn't seem to like ...find('a:second')...
[16:20:47] <systemfault> You decided by yourself that :second existed?
[16:21:00] <lenswipee> lol
[16:21:08] <lenswipee> yeh :)
[16:21:12] <systemfault> Heh..
[16:21:23] <coldhead> it would follow the principle of least surprise if it did exist
[16:21:45] <coldhead> :nth(1)
[16:22:10] <lenswipee> coldhead: what's my alternative?
[16:22:38] <lenswipee> coldhead: i'll try
[16:22:45] <coldhead> :nth(1)
[16:22:47] <systemfault> He said it..
[16:22:51] <coldhead> ?nth
[16:22:52] <bot-t> coldhead, :nth-child() Selector | jQuery API Documentation - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[16:22:52] <coldhead> come on bot-t
[16:23:01] <coldhead> >: |
[16:23:17] <coldhead> apparently you want :eq(1), not :nth(1)
[16:23:26] <lenswipee> I assume :nth(0) is first child
[16:23:31] <coldhead> probably should mention at this point that it's my first day using jQuery
[16:23:41] <coldhead> :nth-child(0) is the first child
[16:23:59] <coldhead> :eq(0) is the 0th element matched by whatever you have before the :eq()
[16:24:10] <systemfault> coldhead: Strangely enoughâ€¦ :nth(1) seems to work o_O
[16:24:24] <systemfault> wtf.
[16:24:28] <coldhead> well fuck me, i'm an undocumented genius
[16:24:40] <coldhead> i'm going to take this up with my parole officer
[16:24:58] <lenswipee> so am i suppose to use nth or eq?
[16:25:24] <coldhead> i don't mind, use whatever works
[16:25:24] <systemfault> :eq/:nth: Finds the nth element on the page (e.g. :eq(5) finds the 6th element on the page). (Part of the sizzle documentation)
[16:25:31] <coldhead> eq() is probably cooler
[16:25:34] <coldhead> because it has a q in it
[16:25:42] <systemfault> So the sizzle doc mentions itâ€¦ but not the jQuery one
[16:25:44] <coldhead> nth sounds like a band-aid being removed
[16:25:46] <coldhead> ?fweep
[16:25:47] <bot-t> coldhead, YARG!
[16:27:19] <BenKxK> hey guys, i have a form, and I want to check the username is unique with ajax. However, I made it so that the username can be dynamically made from the name, what jQuery function can I use for this? keyup won't work cos it's not in the field all the time?
[16:30:28] <lenswipee> thats a big netsplit
[16:30:44] <coldhead> LATELY I NEED A BETTER PLAN
[16:30:44] <coldhead> I WANT TO GET MY KNEES OUT IN THE DIRT WITH MY HANDS
[16:30:51] <lenswipee> seems :first is same as :eq(0)
[16:32:08] <lenswipee> coldhead: can you optimise it, http://jsfiddle.net/6bJnD/1/
[16:33:25] <greg5green`> http://jsfiddle.net/6bJnD/2/
[16:33:29] <greg5green`> prolly how I would do it
[16:34:06] <greg5green`> div.menu-header was overqualified and isnt great to use, unless you have some other element that you also assign the class 'menu-header'
[16:34:11] <HannibalGames> Hello Everyone, can i have some help?
[16:34:29] <greg5green`> and if you do, you should change the class names probably :P
[16:34:44] <HannibalGames> I need check two statement if both return true i want do anything
[16:34:47] <lenswipee> greg5green`: that code stuffed it all up.
[16:34:59] <lenswipee> greg5green`: run it and see
[16:35:06] <HannibalGames> Need check if mouseleave and input blur (focus out) some1 can help?
[16:35:12] <greg5green`> oops
[16:35:15] <greg5green`> i have eq(0) twice
[16:35:16] <greg5green`> lol
[16:35:18] <coldhead> don't use find() http://jsfiddle.net/6bJnD/3/
[16:35:50] <greg5green`> coldhead, using .find is faster than using a complex selecter (at least with classes and ids, not sure about elements)
[16:36:10] <lenswipee> coldhead: your doesn't work either!
[16:36:15] <lenswipee> coldhead: run and see
[16:36:17] <coldhead> i am optimising for readability
[16:36:23] <greg5green`> change the second eq(0) to eq(1)
[16:36:27] <greg5green`> simple
[16:36:28] <coldhead> a function that runs once doesn't need light speed selectors
[16:36:40] <coldhead> on a related note, i don't care
[16:36:45] <coldhead> yall can shut up
[16:36:48] <greg5green> :D
[16:37:08] <coldhead> OPEN UP YOU OPEN UP YOUR OPEN UP YOUR THROAT
[16:37:13] <greg5green> HannibalGames, do you have any code to review?
[16:37:26] <greg5green> Did you write anything? This isn't a place to come just to find people to write JS for you
[16:39:16] <lenswipee> yes i did. i wrote "$"
[16:39:42] <greg5green> lenswipee, was directed more at HannibalGames, but I think you knew that :)
[16:39:42] <HannibalGames> greg5green ill post in fidle sec
[16:40:44] <lenswipee> greg5green: ;)
[16:41:55] <HannibalGames> greg5green can you check? kauan.com.br/piratame
[16:43:05] <HannibalGames> http://www.kauan.com.br/piratame check my logic
[16:43:05] <greg5green> HannibalGames, I can go there
[16:43:21] <greg5green> But, I am too tired from work to do anything more than troubleshoot a small, focused problem
[16:43:31] <greg5green> Sending me to the broken site is not that
[16:43:31] <greg5green> sorry
[16:43:46] <greg5green> Especially one with a Patriots logo on it. NE SUCKS :D
[16:44:13] <HannibalGames> lol
[16:44:25] <HannibalGames> ill send fiddle but omg
[16:44:37] <coldhead> lolll
[16:45:26] <tw2113> uh oh, who tickled coldhead
[16:45:28] <greg5green> Seriously, the Pats are awful I hate them and I hate everyone in here now
[16:45:30] <greg5green> EVERYONE
[16:45:48] <tw2113> what do you have against people named Patrick?
[16:46:03] <samholmes> I'm looking for a simple jQuery slider plugin that could turn collection of elements into a slider similar to what you see on apple.com with the index dots at the bottom, the whole shabang
[16:46:13] <coldhead> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EMtKgmRnQo
[16:47:09] <tw2113> isn't that most of them samholmes ?

[16:59:16] <greg5green> HannibalGames, I don't understand what you are trying to do with blur && mouseleave?
[16:59:28] <greg5green> I guess my question is: why isn't blur enough?
[17:13:22] <coldhead> it's all very complicated isn't it
[17:20:06] <et09> i have $.post("/whatever", { blahblah: { blahblah:blahblah,blah:foobar} },function(data){whatever});
[17:20:20] <et09> i have another object i need to add alongside the first blahblah
[17:20:40] <et09> but i don't want to construct it... i already have code to build it as a serialized string
[17:20:48] <et09> so i suppose i have to dump blahblah to string, or somehow mix the two
[17:20:52] <et09>  anyone?
[17:20:57] <coldhead> you need it to be an object
[17:20:58] <mikerapin> .push?
[17:21:00] <greg5green> then form the json outside of the .post and pass that object
[17:21:02] <coldhead> then you can use ?extend
[17:21:02] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[17:21:10] <coldhead> then serialize that
[17:21:15] <coldhead> don't serialize prematurely!
[17:21:16] <et09> how do i serialize a hash
[17:21:30] <coldhead> i don't know, man, i just work here
[17:21:33] <et09> hmm
[17:21:48] <coldhead> maybe if we can the actual data?
[17:22:07] <coldhead> because the blahbla i have in my imagination works fine
[17:25:41] <et09> umm
[17:26:44] <greg5green> HannibalGames, http://jsfiddle.net/JXX3V/3/ -- I think that is what you are trying to do
[17:27:40] <greg5green> you had times on the .css() and .replaceWith() methods, which you cant do that to
[17:27:43] <greg5green> so those dont animate
[17:28:52] <greg5green> you can animate background-color with .animate() and a plugin, but jquery doesn't do it by default
[17:28:59] <greg5green> there is a color plugin you can use to do that if you want
[17:32:10] <greg5green> also, i switched from replaceWith to html, since replaceWith isn't chainable and all you really want to change is the text inside there anyways
[17:52:56] <JValentin1> mikerapin: looks like I just needed to change the function selector to a higher level. I put it all the way up to the top level UL via it's class
[18:01:47] <draginx> has anyone in here made sonar plugin load on ajax'ed items?
[18:17:37] <HannibalGames> can some1 help?
[18:17:39] <HannibalGames> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/just-do-action-if-mouse-leave-and-blur-focus-out-input
[18:19:14] <greg5green> You didnt like what I spent 30 minutes on?
[18:20:03] <greg5green> I'm a bit offended you just posted for more help instead of even acknowledging I did anything
[18:22:20] <HannibalGames> greg5green ill check i not noticied i was afk
[18:22:27] <HannibalGames> SORRY!
[18:23:14] <HannibalGames> but your code ins't working when my mouse leave area button back to normal
[18:23:55] <HannibalGames> i just want button back to normal when mouse leave area and when i click out input
[18:24:20] <HannibalGames> but your code is much better than mine THANKS!
[18:24:42] <greg5green> because you had it set to #centro which is the whole area
[18:24:49] <greg5green> so when you leave the whole area, it changes back
[18:25:17] <HannibalGames> greg5green can you talk with me please?
[18:25:28] <greg5green> I'm not right now?
[18:25:52] <HannibalGames> yeah but if my keyboard still active in input(to write)
[18:26:53] <HannibalGames> i mean other thing when i leave area you removed focus
[18:27:05] <HannibalGames> i not want it
[18:27:34] <HannibalGames> i want still with focus on input  when mouse leave area, and button large
[18:28:12] <greg5green> 19:59 greg5green: HannibalGames, I don't understand what you are trying to do with blur && mouseleave?
[18:28:12] <greg5green> 19:59 greg5green: I guess my question is: why isn't blur enough?
[18:28:16] <greg5green> Why I asked that and moved on :P
[18:28:23] <HannibalGames> but when i leave area and click outside to remove focus of input button back to normal, only if that statement are true
[18:28:28] <greg5green> You can still do that, but it'll require some more work
[18:28:50] <HannibalGames> because blur, when i click in button it bug
[18:28:54] <coldhead> remember that time that guy connected and asked for help with a thing and then disconnected?
[18:28:57] <HannibalGames> because button is outside of input
[18:28:58] <coldhead> that was crazy
[18:29:12] <greg5green> thats how focus works
[18:29:13] <greg5green> ...
[18:29:20] <greg5green> its only on the input element
[18:29:54] <HannibalGames> but my mouse is on div centro
[18:30:14] <HannibalGames> if my mouse leave so button can back to normal else no...
[18:30:36] <greg5green> well, alter what I wrote then to do what you are trying to do
[18:31:09] <HannibalGames> what?
[18:31:50] <HannibalGames> when i click in button i want it still large only if i click in input first
[18:32:08] <greg5green> then write it to act that way
[18:32:25] <greg5green> I've tried to help but you went afk when I was doing it
[18:32:43] <greg5green> good luck, but I don't really care at this point
[18:32:50] <HannibalGames> because when i write a string to search button ill show Advanced Search, ill display a drop down menu with checkboxs
[18:32:55] <HannibalGames> :(
[18:33:59] <HannibalGames> thanks for explain about animate
[18:34:09] <greg5green> np
[18:34:12] <greg5green> check api.jquery.com
[18:34:26] <greg5green> you can do what i think you want if you use .isfocus() and write some if statements around it
[18:35:00] <HannibalGames> yeah but my problem is check two statments, im begginer
[18:35:19] <greg5green> then go read about javascript for a bit
[18:35:47] <HannibalGames> jquery syntax see like php but
[18:36:12] <HannibalGames> you know a bit of php?
[18:36:29] <greg5green> barely any
[18:37:21] <HannibalGames> for me, blur, focus see like a functions pre-defined like in php (is_number(), etc)
[18:37:51] <greg5green> blur and focus are two events fired by the browser
[18:37:57] <greg5green> they arent functions
[18:38:11] <greg5green> .blur() and .focus are shorthand for .on("blur", function() {}):
[18:38:27] <greg5green> and .on("focus", function() {});
[18:41:14] <HannibalGames> yeah know but, i can check if focus is actived so works similar
[18:43:07] <HannibalGames> i was trying find some thing like it, if( blur && mouseleave) { dosomeaction }
[18:43:42] <greg5green> you cant do those two events at the same time
[18:43:53] <HannibalGames> but why?
[18:43:54] <greg5green> because they are events fired by the browser
[18:43:57] <greg5green> either your mouse is leaving
[18:44:05] <greg5green> or you are losing focus on your input field
[18:44:31] <HannibalGames> enter in fiddle
[18:44:51] <HannibalGames> write some thing and move your mouse and you can still write
[18:45:03] <HannibalGames> so focus keep on
[18:45:27] <greg5green> yes, because blur is fired when you either tab or click out of the input field (or if you trigger a "fake" blur event)
[18:45:51] <greg5green> blur = when the cursor leaves the input field by some user action
[18:46:37] <HannibalGames> blur works like focusout right?
[18:47:13] <greg5green> http://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[18:47:15] <greg5green> if you read
[18:47:22] <greg5green> yes, except focusout bubbles up
[18:47:52] <HannibalGames> yeah blur works perfect, but if i click in button larged it bugs so i need another statement to keep it large when im writing
[18:49:52] <greg5green> it isnt "bugging", it is doing what is expected
[18:50:03] <HannibalGames> have any way to focus form?
[18:50:14] <greg5green> when you click on the button, you bluring the input field
[18:50:43] <greg5green> You can, but it's more complicated
[18:50:46] <HannibalGames> yeah, and i dont want it
[18:50:56] <greg5green> all i can think of right now involves writing a custom event and using it
[18:51:15] <greg5green> ...using it instead of blur
[18:52:13] <HannibalGames> what plugin you use to do any action after some time?
[18:52:34] <HannibalGames> like jquery.hoverIntent
[18:52:35] <greg5green> I'm sure there is one out there, but I'd write it myself
[18:52:46] <greg5green> so I can't help you there
[18:54:27] <HannibalGames> Ok!
[18:54:53] <HannibalGames> its ok
[18:57:00] <HannibalGames> too much complicated

[21:47:30] <laddest> how do i add a pause button on this?? http://jsfiddle.net/me899/
[21:51:40] <greg5green> coldhead, you see any examples of posterous's "xml exports"?
[21:51:46] <greg5green> they were pretty hilarious
[21:51:58] <greg5green> (if you were just reading about them instead of actually trying to extract data)
[21:52:24] <coldhead> i haven't seen any
[21:52:29] <coldhead> weekend diversion!
[21:53:16] <greg5green> I saw an example on HN yesterday
[21:54:14] <greg5green> I have no idea what it was called, ill see if i can find it in my history tomorrow during some down time
[21:54:23] <greg5green> (lets be serious, its friday, its likely to happen)
[21:54:51] <coldhead> oh man
[21:54:57] <coldhead> i have had one of those fridays
[21:55:10] <coldhead> twitter all morning
[21:55:12] <coldhead> beer at lunch
[21:55:26] <coldhead> and then get back to the office just in time for beer oclock
[21:56:48] <greg5green> shit, I still have go to go to sleep before I go to Friday's version of work
[21:56:59] <greg5green> have to go to*
[21:57:33] <relipse>  does anyone have a website that attracts freelancers and interested getting money or %sales for advertising?
[21:58:18] <greg5green> ads@google.com
[21:58:44] <coldhead> wat are you even
[21:58:45] <greg5green> I dont know if thats a real email, sorry. I'm snarky tonight
[21:59:04] <coldhead> caveat emailer
[22:16:40] <ryorky1> why would the following line throw me an unrecognized expression error?  	$(window).load(function(){ctypeval = $('input[name=company[company_type]]:checked').val();
[22:17:23] <coldhead> because you have [] within []
[22:17:26] <coldhead> without escapes
[22:17:32] <coldhead> and you should have quotes around that too
[22:17:52] <coldhead> $('input[name="company[company_type]"]:checked')
[22:17:54] <coldhead> or
[22:18:01] <coldhead> $('input[name="company\[company_type\]"]:checked')
[22:18:03] <coldhead> or
[22:18:06] <defaultro> hey folks, really need your help badly
[22:18:09] <coldhead> $('input[name="company\\[company_type\\]"]:checked')
[22:18:25] <coldhead> probably the first or the last
[22:18:33] <coldhead> can you be more specific defaultsy
[22:18:36] <defaultro> i have a form and I would like to dynamically update a hidden attribute's value right after I click submit button
[22:19:04] <coldhead> but before the data is actually submitted?
[22:19:08] <defaultro> yes
[22:19:30] <defaultro> here is the existing submit code, http://pastebin.com/248FYmNn
[22:19:46] <defaultro> the attribute is called csrftoken
[22:20:22] <defaultro> when the form is opened, I want it blank. Once the user clicks submit, it will get populated. The value is in PHP session
[22:22:09] <defaultro> the html is <input type="hidden" name="csrftoken" value="<?php echo $csrftoken ?" />
[22:22:23] <defaultro> this is bad
[22:22:29] <defaultro> i will now do it like this
[22:22:35] <defaultro> the html is <input type="hidden" name="csrftoken" value="" />
[22:22:55] <defaultro> value will be blank initially, then once submitted, the value will be populated
[22:23:14] <defaultro> sorry, once submit button is clicked, it will be populated
[22:23:19] <coldhead> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/6pVzS/
[22:23:23] <defaultro> awesome
[22:24:38] <defaultro> cool
[22:25:36] <defaultro> I will change this  $('#secret').val('pants') so that the value will not be displayed. I will call a tmpfile which will contain the csrftoken. Once the code is read, that's the time it will update the value
[22:25:49] <coldhead> do what you gotta do
[22:25:57] <coldhead> are you fighting an urgent spam problem?
[22:26:09] <defaultro> somewhat
[22:26:12] <defaultro> another question
[22:26:21] <defaultro> will I remove our submit button?
[22:26:25] <defaultro> oops
[22:26:27] <defaultro> our submit code
[22:26:36] <defaultro> this one, http://pastebin.com/248FYmNn
[22:27:16] <coldhead> i don't think it's doing any harm
[22:27:30] <coldhead> might want to disable it once clicked to prevent repeated submissions
[22:27:34] <coldhead> matter for yourself
[22:27:42] <defaultro> k
[22:30:46] <defaultro> testing it now
[22:31:46] <defaultro> the alert worked but it didn't submit
[22:33:45] <defaultro> my this.submit() had a value of e
[22:33:52] <defaultro> it was this.submit(e); :)
[22:34:15] <defaultro> hmmm, it still didn't submit it
[22:36:50] <defaultro> ah, i'm getting a this.submit is not a function
[22:37:45] <defaultro> coldhead, why is it saying that this.submit is not a function?
[22:39:35] <Cork> sounds like this isn't a form
[22:40:49] <defaultro> it is
[22:40:53] <defaultro> i'll paste the whole code
[22:41:25] <coldhead> if you bind to the form's submit event
[22:41:29] <coldhead> then this will be the form
[22:41:34] <coldhead> if you are binding to the submit BUTTON
[22:41:40] <coldhead> it will be the button and not the form
[22:41:44] <Cork> ya
[22:41:46] <defaultro> http://pastebin.com/r88Yiney
[22:41:55] <defaultro> my changes are at the very bottom
[22:41:57] <coldhead> you might be able to fix it lazily with $(this).closest('form')[0].submit()
[22:42:08] <pantheon> please someoneone help. how do i put a pause button on this?? http://jsfiddle.net/cSK6R/4/ i got the demo from http://www.thepixelart.com/create-a-typing-text-effect-using-jquery/
[22:42:19] <coldhead> but i've had too many beers to explain it decently
[22:42:19] <defaultro> i used the id to make sure I am calling the form
[22:42:43] <coldhead> cool
[22:42:51] <Cork> defaultro: and you get the error on line 171?
[22:43:04] <Cork> that doesn't make sense...
[22:43:10] <defaultro> it complains that this.submit is not a function
[22:43:13] <defaultro> in Firebug
[22:43:28] <pantheon> ?
[22:43:37] <Cork> and console.log(this) on line 170 gives you the form in the console?
[22:43:52] <defaultro> ok, i'll try that
[22:43:54] <coldhead> pantheon: i tried adding a pause button but i don't know how that ticker library works
[22:44:02] <coldhead> so i gave up and had more beer
[22:44:05] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss
[22:44:09] <pantheon> coldhead: lol ok thx
[22:45:17] <defaultro> it says <form id="form-user-profile" method="post" action="">
[22:45:43] <defaultro> that's from console.log(this);
[22:46:04] <Cork> defaultro: weird that should work just fine with this.submit()...
[22:46:08] <defaultro> yup
[22:46:19] <defaultro> maybe it's because of the kohana framework
[22:47:10] <defaultro> so this.submit() is the same action when we click submit
[22:47:21] <defaultro> i mean, it does the same thing?
[22:47:54] <defaultro> is the code I added correct?
[22:48:05] <coldhead> Cork: ?
[22:48:15] <coldhead> OVER TO YOU, BIG GUY
[22:50:13] <defaultro> when I click on the this.submit is not a function, Firebug brings me to another window and it brought me to line 14
[22:51:56] <defaultro> line 14 of profile is -> if (window.location.protocol == 'https:') {
[22:52:26] <defaultro> don't know why firebug is complaining to this.submit and pointing to the above text I wrote
[22:52:40] <coldhead> just before you call submit
[22:52:41] <coldhead> try
[22:52:50] <coldhead> console.log(this, this.submit)
[22:53:02] <coldhead> you should see <form..., function ()...
[22:53:05] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[22:53:17] <defaultro> ok, above this.submit(), I will add your code?
[22:53:19] <coldhead> if you see <form..., and undefined
[22:53:28] <coldhead> then i don't know what the hell is going on
[22:53:42] <coldhead> yes, just before you CALL submit
[22:53:43] <defaultro> running it now
[22:54:31] <defaultro> i'll make a screenshot
[22:54:35] <defaultro> it's long
[22:55:56] <defaultro> uploading
[22:56:33] <defaultro> http://imgur.com/ILNcVZO
[22:56:38] <defaultro> checking link
[22:58:04] <defaultro> it's weird, the link opens on my other pc
[22:58:13] <defaultro> one sec
[23:00:00] <defaultro> this works, http://i.imgur.com/lLNcVZO.png
[23:00:31] <defaultro> that is console.log(this, this.submit);
[23:00:48] <defaultro> what do you think about the output coldhead?
[23:01:18] <coldhead> when i opened that PNG my gombuter crashed
[23:01:25] <coldhead> so i don't feel good about it at the moment
[23:01:29] <defaultro> oh
[23:01:36] <defaultro> let me just paste the text here
[23:01:38] <defaultro> one sec
[23:01:58] <coldhead> it's alright, i got it
[23:02:03] <coldhead> i can't see the submit
[23:02:07] <coldhead> just the <form>
[23:02:17] <coldhead> so `this` is the form as it should be
[23:02:40] <coldhead> i wonder if it's because you don't have an action
[23:02:46] <coldhead> so the form doesn't have anywhere to submit to
[23:03:01] <defaultro> not sure but it works without that, Kohana takes care of it
[23:03:12] <coldhead> well it also fucks things up for you
[23:03:14] <coldhead> apparently
[23:03:18] <defaultro> :(
[23:03:21] <coldhead> my day is done anyhow, good luck
[23:03:27] <coldhead> (ask Cork :D)
[23:03:28] <defaultro> k
[23:03:35] <defaultro> hopefully he's still here
[23:32:27] <djQuery> whats going on?
[23:32:37] <djQuery> defaultro, ^^
[23:34:28] <defaultro> hey
[23:35:02] <defaultro> coldhead taught me how to do a submit using jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/6pVzS/
[23:35:28] <tw2113> how rude of him!
[23:35:33] <tw2113> i mean, good job
[23:35:35] <defaultro> i implemented it in my code, http://pastebin.com/r88Yiney
[23:36:04] <defaultro> it does call this.submit but it's failing with this.submit is not a function
[23:36:13] <djQuery> defaultro, did he teach you not to use alert?
[23:36:18] <defaultro> http://i.imgur.com/lLNcVZO.png
[23:36:19] <tw2113> darn methods
[23:36:22] <defaultro> i use console.log
[23:36:24] <defaultro> used
[23:36:39] <djQuery> defaultro, and if you use console.log(this) what is this?
[23:36:47] <defaultro> it's the
[23:36:49] <defaultro> wait
[23:36:58] <tw2113> busted
[23:37:13] <defaultro> if you look at the png image, it the first <>
[23:37:54] <djQuery> are we talking about line 168 of http://pastebin.com/r88Yiney
[23:37:59] <karstenk1977_> Morning
[23:38:04] <defaultro> checking
[23:38:22] <defaultro> yes
[23:38:25] <defaultro> that's the code I added
[23:38:36] <karstenk1977_> How to bind a mouseover event that starts a function only if the mouse is a special time over?
[23:38:47] <djQuery> hmm it should be the form at that point
[23:39:06] <djQuery> karnowski, see ?hoverintent
[23:39:11] <bot-t> karnowski, hoverIntent - jQuery Plugin Registry - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[23:39:14] <defaultro> assuming my alert code isn't commented out, it does call that function
[23:40:08] <defaultro> value of console.log(this) is       <form id="form-user-profile" method="post" action="">
[23:40:23] <defaultro> value of console.log(this.submit) is         <input class="buttonGD white" type="submit" name="submit" title="Update" value="Update">
[23:41:13] <defaultro> form action is action="". Not sure if that affects it. Kohana framework takes care where to submit it
[23:42:53] <djQuery> defaultro, shouldn't cause a problem
[23:43:00] <defaultro> i know :(
[23:43:00] <djQuery> it all looks right to me
[23:43:10] <defaultro> did you see the png image?
[23:43:14] <djQuery> $(this).triger('submit')
[23:43:16] <djQuery> yes
[23:43:23] <defaultro> what is that code?
[23:43:26] * RandalSchwartz waves
[23:43:40] <djQuery> put it in place of the this.submit()
[23:43:47] <defaultro> ok
[23:43:51] <defaultro> double letter g right
[23:44:00] <djQuery> yes sorry typo
[23:44:39] <djQuery> and maybe try getting rid of action=""
[23:44:41] <defaultro> trying it now
[23:45:33] <defaultro> it said, too much recursion
[23:45:51] <djQuery> so that did try submitting it then
[23:45:56] <defaultro> k
[23:46:02] <djQuery> defaultro, why are you trying to do this?
[23:46:24] <djQuery> basicaly inside of form submit you cant call form submit
[23:46:26] <defaultro> because I would like to dynamically update csrftoken on the fly and not make a value
[23:46:29] <defaultro> not put a value
[23:46:32] <RandalSchwartz> having a submit in the middle of a submit handler is generally a bad idea
[23:46:59] <karstenk1977_> is hoverIntent the answer that suits my problem too?
[23:47:00] <defaultro> i basically would like to mimic how csrf-magic does it. However, csrf-magic clashes with KOhana framework :(
[23:47:06] <djQuery> that is like function loopy(){ loopy(); }()
[23:48:48] <djQuery> var submitted = false     $('#form-user-profile').submit(function(e) { if (!submitted){ submitted = true; $(this).trigger('submit'); }});}
[23:49:00] <defaultro> ok
[23:49:02] <djQuery> defaultro, will stop recursion
[23:49:17] <djQuery> defaultro, do you understand the code?
[23:49:22] <defaultro> I'll try but it's not leaving the code
[23:49:39] <defaultro> yes, if it's submitted because true, it will submit
[23:49:43] <djQuery> NM that will never do anything
[23:49:56] <djQuery> no it won;t
[23:50:03] <djQuery> it will just trigger the same thing
[23:50:07] <defaultro> yup
[23:50:21] <djQuery> and I left out the e.preventDefault();
[23:50:26] <defaultro> k
[23:50:57] <djQuery> defaultro, typically the only reason to do something like this is to do error checking on the form to verify that the fields are populated before doing the submit
[23:51:05] <defaultro> k
[23:51:42] <djQuery> if the error checking is BAD then you do the e.preventDefault() i
[23:51:47] <defaultro> got it
[23:52:12] <goddard> whats wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/pczSr4Qg
[23:52:32] <goddard> when i click on my elmenet to trigger the dialog it breaks all my javascript and gives no error
[23:56:21] <djQuery> defaultro, http://jsfiddle.net/6pVzS/1/      something like this
[23:57:18] <djQuery> goddard, I don't think this is what you think it is in your close function
[23:57:48] <djQuery> goddard, that should be mailAddresEditDialog.dialog('close');
[23:57:55] <karstenk1977_> Please tell me whats wrong.  http://pastebin.com/GkQ5bGFQ    site http://drews.tom-develop.com/blog/
[23:59:02] <djQuery> karstenk1977_, jQuery(this).children(".Teaser").stop().animate({"width": "100%"}, 300);
