[00:23:05] <RedBull> I want to see submit results without refresh page
[00:50:22] <mkoks> hello, any advice how can I select element with JQuery like $("a[href*=mid=35]") ?
[00:50:46] <mkoks> right now it doesnt wok because of two equality signs, but I dont know how to do it otherwise.
[00:52:04] <pafka> mkoks do you mean $("a[href='http://.../']) ?
[00:52:17] <pafka> mkoks do you mean $("a[href='http://.../']") ?
[00:54:19] <mkoks> pafka not really, I want to select element if href contains that kind of string
[01:04:04] <Clorith> I'm trying ot build a data string to send with my ajax call, but I'm not quite sure why the formData variable is empty after my .each() loop. I've set up a fiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/Clorith/frsUq/ of my attempt if someone has 5 minutes
[01:05:35] <b2l> cool
[01:06:48] <b2l> why don't you use the real name attribute ?
[01:07:10] <b2l> then you can use the jQuery .serialize() function to stringify all your input
[01:07:49] <Clorith> I'd love to, but my ajax call is a bi-product in an existing form
[01:07:58] <b2l> ok
[01:08:01] <Clorith> So the name attribute would screw wit hthe behavior of the for mthen
[01:09:33] <b2l> ok, the event is never triggered for me
[01:09:53] <b2l> can't you just use the submit event on the whole form ?
[01:10:18] <Clorith> Don't want to submit the whole form, just those 9 fields
[01:10:37] <Clorith> It triggers for me, and it clearly loops because the "trigger" log event runs 14 times (which is the right amount of input fields)
[01:12:36] <Clorith> Might be easier to just work around the form name="" element and see if I can sneak in a .serialize() I think
[01:12:39] <Clorith> I'll give that a whirl =)
[01:13:51] <sheilablackrose> hi guys if i want to have a panel that floats at th ebottom of a screen. thats a div right?
[01:13:59] <sheilablackrose> n i tongle it hide n show with jquery?
[01:16:21] <b2l> Clorith, OMG, didn't see it, just don't use the "var formData" but "formData", you create a new variable for each element in your loop instead of using the one you set before
[01:16:43] <Clorith> Oh my, did I really do somethign so dumb? >_<
[01:16:54] <b2l> :) it happens some time
[01:18:30] <Clorith> Thank you =)
[01:24:38] <Cork> sheilablackrose: the smoothest experience for that is through css position:fixed
[01:24:55] <Cork> js will always flicker around
[01:32:40] <sheilablackrose> ah cork!!!!
[01:32:43] <sheilablackrose> my fav guy!!!
[01:33:51] <sheilablackrose> so what im looking for is i have a pretty complex page with multiples tables n stuff. each row has a checkbox. so basically what im trying to do is as long there is a single textbox clicked a panel will appear at the bottom of the screen without disturbing the ui
[01:33:58] <sheilablackrose> am i correct to use adiv
[01:33:58] <sheilablackrose> ?
[01:34:59] <sheilablackrose> than set bottm n float. n use jquery to hide n show
[01:37:08] <dawra> when i sort a column in datatable,s why does it execute the filters too ?
[01:48:19] <rindolf> Hi all.
[01:48:38] <sheilablackrose> hi
[01:49:56] <Cork> sheilablackrose: if you want the div to appear at the bottom of the screen, the best css rule is position: fixed, not float
[01:50:33] <Cork> sheilablackrose: if you want it to float relative to the target, but still inline in the content (disposition text and images) then yes float is what you want
[01:57:16] <iSeeDeadPixels> jQuery is the best thing that happened to me since PHP
[01:57:55] <dawra> haha
[02:02:27] <sheilablackrose> thank you i will test out which best suits
[02:12:47] <crooksey_> I have this setup currently http://dpaste.com/845172/ each time I drop a new item in or out of my ul, can I set the Total Weight to automatically update? By somehow extracting the weight variable from the string?
[02:20:56] <sheilablackrose> cork
[02:21:00] <sheilablackrose> are you there
[02:23:06] <sheilablackrose> can someone help me wth this http://postimage.org/image/x2uum6u3f/e90b830c/ what css should i use to specify the next row
[02:23:45] <sheilablackrose> i want that behaviour where if the size of the div maintains n the boxes fall below but i need alittle more gap
[02:26:08] <noregret> I have two json structures here http://bin.cakephp.org/view/678017289 (the top one and bottom) is it hte right way to join them into one structure ? (i added '[' .. ']')
[02:26:54] <mkoks> $("ul li") << how can I use this to select all first level elements, but not li children?
[02:28:08] <Cork> sheilablackrose: you would have to put them into a separate container element
[02:28:24] <Cork> sheilablackrose: its one of the current shortcomings of css
[02:28:41] <Cork> but flexbox will with a big of luck fix that
[02:28:46] <Cork> ?g w3c flexbox

[02:29:38] <rindolf> noregret: what is?
[02:29:43] <sheilablackrose> oh you mean i wont b able to specify the position of the overflow and also to break the whole thing into a new line with css?
[02:29:53] <sheilablackrose> ok ill go back n read that link
[02:30:12] <sheilablackrose> c ya guys in abit
[02:30:14] <sheilablackrose> tq bye
[02:37:11] <noregret> noregret: wht ?
[02:43:20] <noregret> rindolf: what ?
[02:44:06] <noregret> rindolf: if you mean teh "way", i just put them in an array surrounding them by '[]' and putting a comma fter the first structure
[02:44:24] <rindolf> noregret: where's the code where are you trying to merge them?
[02:44:44] <rindolf> noregret: I think this will give you an array of two array references.
[02:45:07] <noregret> rindolf: nevermind the code, i'm just asking for a good way to merge them
[02:45:21] <noregret> to be one JSON structure ie
[02:45:23] <rindolf> noregret: do you want to concatenate two JS arrays?
[02:46:28] <noregret> rindolf: i didn't get that json from JS, it's from an API and i just want to join them in one structure so i can accss them later on in JS
[02:47:26] <rindolf> noregret: OK, then there are JS primitives for merging two data structures.
[02:47:27] <noregret> and i want them to be in a good and siple strcuture that can be easily accessible, either by $.each () or by just calling the values
[02:47:42] <noregret> aha
[02:48:38] <noregret> rindolf: like what
[02:49:16] <rindolf> noregret: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_array.asp
[02:51:06] <noregret> rindolf: well, I won't be using JS for that :) I will use JS for reading it and no writing. So i'm thinking the example i pasted is correct
[02:51:18] <iSeeDeadPixels> ok, so $.getJSON doesn't retrieve the whole file...
[02:51:34] <rindolf> noregret: I still don't understand what you want to do.
[02:51:43] <rindolf> noregret: and in which language and where.
[02:52:36] <noregret> rindolf: im using python to fetch that json from a certain api then put it in a db, now i will get several strcutures eventually and i want to combine them into one so i can read them later thru JS
[02:53:39] <rindolf> noregret: OK, then you can use the Python + operator to concatenate two lists (Python's terminology for arrays).
[02:55:05] <rindolf> noregret: + in Python does numeric addition, string concatenation and list concatenation.
[02:55:22] <pixolin> hello. I have a basic question with jquery's .hover : I have a list with four list items and I want an image to show up if I hover over a list item and toggle when not hovering over the list item. I use $('li').hover( function(){ $(this).children('.pin').toggle(); }, function(){ $(this).children('.pin').toggle(); } )  but this only works if I hover over the list item and then leave the entire list.
[02:55:40] <computer2000> i need to get the name of the first key of my json object, how?
[02:55:43] <pixolin> it doesn't work if I move from one list item to the next within that list though.
[02:56:41] <noregret> rindolf: concat with adding a ',' then an opening and closing '[' ']' ?
[02:56:47] <rindolf> pixolin: can you try pasting a representative example to http://jsfiddle.com/ or something.
[02:56:55] <rindolf> noregret: what?
[02:56:59] <rindolf> noregret: in Python?
[02:57:10] <noregret> rindolf: because if I just concated, the string won't be a json sctructure, right ?
[02:57:15] <noregret> yes
[02:57:15] <pixolin> yes, while I was typing that I figured out it got somewhat lengthy. sorry.
[02:57:31] <rindolf> noregret: [ arr1, arr2] ==>  an array of arrays. arr1 + arr2 ==> a concatenated array.
[02:58:11] <rindolf> noregret: I think Python's JSON module translates the string to a nested Python data structure.
[02:58:16] <noregret> rindolf: i'm not looking for syntax here... i just want a workable json structue
[02:58:25] <amcsi_work> hi
[02:58:28] <rindolf> noregret: OK.
[02:58:38] <amcsi_work> how come (new $.Deferred) instanceof $.Deferred is false?
[02:59:02] <computer2000> can someone help me to retrieve the first object inside this json http://pastebin.com/9TnLt0AW - id like to do something like var thing = references[0]
[02:59:48] <iSeeDeadPixels> is jQuery's getJSON limited? timeout wise or the amount of data it downloads?
[03:00:20] <amcsi_work> Or can you easily manipulate what a constructor returns?
[03:00:42] <rindolf> noregret: then you can put both data structures as the values of a dictionary.
[03:00:45] <victorius79> Hi guys, I'm trying to get the BACKGROUND-COLOR property of multiple TR's from a table. I using the console in Chrome because I just need the list of color values to use elsewhere.
[03:01:02] <victorius79> I'm using this: jQuery('.contenttable tbody tr').css('background-color'); but that only returns the first matched element.
[03:01:11] <rindolf> noregret: and you should understand what the syntax does.
[03:02:11] <noregret> rindolf: no, you're getting what i'm asking
[03:02:20] <rindolf> noregret: what?
[03:02:22] <noregret> rindolf: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/678017289 do you see the two strcuts ?
[03:02:25] <victorius79> I'm reading the docs but I'm missing something. Getting the TABLE  TD TEXT() values with :nth-child was no problem...
[03:03:56] <rindolf> noregret: I do.
[03:04:10] <rindolf> noregret: how are you interested in combining them?
[03:04:26] <rindolf> noregret: and why don't you know how to do that in Python?
[03:04:32] <noregret> rindolf: i want to combine them into a VALID JSON structure
[03:04:41] <noregret> rindolf: forget python
[03:04:42] <shoky> victorius79: jQuery('.contenttable tbody tr').map(function(i, elem) { return $(this).css('background-color') }).get()
[03:04:48] <noregret> rindolf: let's say i don't know shit about json
[03:05:11] <rindolf> noregret: you need to expand the JSON, manipulate it and serialise it again.
[03:05:41] <noregret> rindolf: isn't it enough to make it [ one, two] won't that be valid json ?
[03:06:04] <rindolf> noregret: what is one and two?
[03:06:08] <noregret> rindolf: i might get more structs later
[03:06:14] <noregret> rindolf: teh structs in the paste
[03:06:31] <noregret> rindolf: note //one and //two
[03:06:51] <noregret> rindolf: line 1 and 307
[03:07:39] <victorius79> shoky: Nice! Thanks!!
[03:08:24] <rindolf> noregret: [ one , two] would be an array of two references.
[03:08:35] <rindolf> noregret: is that what you want?
[03:08:41] <rindolf> noregret: do you know what references are?
[03:08:55] <rindolf> noregret: in Python every data structure is a reference.
[03:09:16] <rindolf> noregret: you can also create circular references.
[03:10:07] <rindolf> noregret: but I don't think JSON supports circular references and they are a source of many problems anyway.
[03:10:13] <noregret> rindolf: forget python, i'm talking about json "[one,two]" (replace one and two with teh strcuts in the pate)
[03:10:42] <rindolf> noregret: then it would be an array containing the two JSON { ... } .
[03:11:10] <rindolf> noregret: but it's better to use { "one": $one, "two": $two }
[03:11:18] <noregret> rindolf: is it the best way to combining them so they can be accessable
[03:11:19] <noregret> i see
[03:11:35] <noregret> ok then, thanks
[03:12:04] <rindolf> noregret: if you're not interested in merging them somehow, then yes.
[03:12:52] <noregret> rindolf: no, not merging, just making a single json strcuture
[03:13:12] <rindolf> noregret: OK.
[03:13:19] <noregret> thanks
[03:14:19] <rindolf> noregret: in general, you should use arrays for sequential data, and structs when they are of different types.
[03:15:38] <noregret> hmm, so should i change this to strcut instead of an aray ?
[03:16:07] <SAM___> hy
[03:16:25] <noregret> rindolf: like this http://bin.cakephp.org/view/678017289 ?
[03:17:50] <rindolf> noregret: yes.
[03:43:10] <helly> Hi. I've got a form with with 3 fields, you can press the + button and another 3 fields appear.  The input name is like this: owners[firm][0][name] and owners[firm][1][name] if you click the + button. I don't have a clue how to deal with this using php. I want the values as variables.
[03:44:08] <Cork> helly: that sounds like a question for ##php not #jquery
[03:44:56] <rindolf> Someone should /kick gar_onn
[03:45:07] <rindolf> ops
[03:45:08] <rindolf> !ops

[03:45:42] <sosdiode> can any one help me with this..is there a trigger to run one scriopt after the ather ..http://pastebin.com/yu83rztZ
[03:46:30] <Cork> sosdiode: define the script as a function and call it from the other
[03:46:53] <Cork> but basically no, there isn't
[04:28:22] <mkoks> how can I set styles for certain media with jquery?
[04:52:44] <lombrozo> can anyone tell me why the top margin on the 2nd hr is ignored please: http://dabblet.com/gist/4276171
[04:55:54] <Cork> lombrozo: cause the div is a float
[04:57:06] <Cork> lombrozo: in the outer div replace float: left; with overflow: hidden;
[04:58:27] <shoky> Cork: can you explain that? dont understand the overflow: hidden
[04:58:34] <iSeeDeadPixels> getJSON doesn't download the complete json file...
[04:58:36] <shoky> (but i see it works )
[04:58:47] <Cork> shoky: its children is float: left
[04:59:02] <Cork> that means they break out of the text flow
[04:59:18] <lombrozo> Cork - thanks!
[04:59:23] <shoky> mmm
[04:59:31] <Cork> if you wrap it in an overflow element that will trap them and make the parent adjust its height to the children
[04:59:39] <sosdiode> fuck fuck fuuuuuccccc
[04:59:47] <Cork> and there for make the margin work
[04:59:50] <shoky> ahh
[04:59:59] <shoky> i see. thx
[05:00:23] <Cork> AND you should almost never use clear:
[05:00:39] <Cork> its an old hack for floats and it breaks very easily (like here)

[05:22:10] <alex116> hi, I can't get jquery and jqueryui to work properly because my script stops because it can't find $.widget.extend
[05:22:13] <iSeeDeadPixels> it doesn't download the complete json file

[05:26:24] <alex116> it works fine with jquery 1.8.0 and jquery-ui 1.8.23
[05:28:02] <alex116> I read here: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#added-widget-extend-to-handle-array-references that the extends method was added in 1.9
[05:28:51] <alex116> but it doesn't seem to work for me and I don't know jqueryui internals
[05:32:16] <alex116> btw, this all occurs because of a $(div).accordion({fillspace: true}) call

[06:48:49] <mkoks> why do you think its dull?
[06:50:05] <Ore4444> Well, it's very comprehensive, but annoyingly succinct
[06:50:38] <flat_eric> someone, please? =)
[06:50:51] <Ore4444> Also, it's purely practical and I like getting the behind-the-scenes explanation
[06:51:15] <JAAulde> My fellow jQuerians, g'morning
[06:51:23] <mkoks> good
[06:51:23] <JAAulde> how ya'll is?
[06:51:32] <mkoks> quite tired
[06:51:45] <mkoks> waiting for working day to end
[06:51:58] <mkoks> you?
[06:52:02] <JAAulde> mkoks: understood. i think that's the state in which i've lived most of my life
[06:52:13] <JAAulde> tired, but generall ok :)
[06:52:19] <Ore4444> Using jQuery UI Spinner, during a spin, how do I access the old value?
[06:52:24] <mkoks> thats well
[06:53:02] <mkoks> I hope dont live with that state all day long, just last hours :)
[06:53:39] <flat_eric> do someone of you have a minute?
[06:53:53] <aro> it only does it in IE
[06:55:36] <Krambiorix> hi , i'm using qtip 2 and i wondered if i can't set the text to show when the qtip is opening. Can someone help?
[06:58:05] <mkoks> why do people have to ask such a hard questions
[07:00:29] <mkoks> cya
[07:00:55] <JAAulde> flat_eric: just ask your question, and if anyone has a minute they'll look at it and answer
[07:01:24] <flat_eric> i do have a problem with handover some data out of js into html
[07:01:33] <flat_eric> i uploaded the snippets
[07:01:40] <flat_eric> http://pastebin.com/C2P1Cdnt
[07:01:46] <flat_eric> http://pastebin.com/xjqWxYJP
[07:02:40] <flat_eric> the point is, that the line where title handovers is working
[07:03:15] <flat_eric> and actually it should be the same with begin, end and description as well. but these aren't working...
[07:04:56] <JAAulde> flat_eric: by "handover" do you mean hover?
[07:05:09] <flat_eric> sorry, no...
[07:05:17] <flat_eric> i have some data in my db
[07:05:41] <flat_eric> i read it with an function
[07:06:16] <flat_eric> and give it to the div like $('#eventbeginn').html(event.start);
[07:06:46] <flat_eric> i've already had a look at the console.log(event) and the data are in the object
[07:06:56] <flat_eric> but it won't give it to the div...
[07:07:00] <JAAulde> flat_eric: ah, ok...you mean in the eventClick function ?
[07:07:07] <flat_eric> right
[07:07:39] <JAAulde> ok, looking at it.  i am pretty experienced with fullCalendar, but it has been a while so I am looking at the docs
[07:07:56] <flat_eric> thanks alot =)
[07:09:46] <JAAulde> flat_eric: in your html paste, I don't see the #calendar element.  I assume this exists outside of the markup you showed? the markup showed is just the stuff you're trying to manipulate on an event click?
[07:10:20] <flat_eric> yep, but i can show u the rest
[07:10:22] <flat_eric> wait
[07:10:45] <JAAulde> flat_eric: no, it's ok
[07:10:51] <JAAulde> I am just making sure I understand it all
[07:11:29] <JAAulde> flat_eric: also, it looks like you're feeding the calendar some events at load, rather than using some sort of external AJAX source, correct?
[07:12:15] <flat_eric> yes that should be right
[07:13:08] <JAAulde> flat_eric: ok, great. so i think I understand your setup. could you provide me the output of a var_dump() on your $events variable in PHP?
[07:14:13] <flat_eric> string(288) "[{"id":"1","title":"Test","start":"2012-12-01 15:42:48","end":"2012-12-04 11:45:00","allDay":"1","description":"Das ist nur ein Test.","url":null},{"id":"2","title":"oma besuchen","start":"2012-12-22 15:00:00","end":"2012-12-22 17:00:00","allDay":"0","description":null,"url":null},false]"
[07:14:21] <flat_eric> thats it
[07:14:35] <JAAulde> ok
[07:14:36] <flat_eric> i used the unix timestamp
[07:14:43] <flat_eric> for the date
[07:15:09] <flat_eric> and text for the description
[07:15:42] <hatseflats> hey guys, I've got a strange IE related issue where when I open a dialog through jq the first form field receives focus, and I want to prevent that
[07:16:39] <hatseflats> I've traced it down to the call to .dialog('open'), and I'm not sure what to do, intercepting the call to focus the dialog window is complexer than I thought, simply returning in that callback leaves the contents of the dialog in a weird 'read only' state
[07:17:26] <JAAulde> flat_eric: ok, each event looks ok. why is there a third item in your array? i see a bool false following the first two events
[07:18:15] <JAAulde> hatseflats: i think dialog purposely takes focus as they are generally used for input. we had this issue once as well...lemme see if I can find out solution
[07:18:36] <flat_eric> hmm... yes i see it now too. but no idea where it could be from
[07:18:39] <flat_eric> wait
[07:19:35] <flat_eric> there is no bool datatype in my database..
[07:19:41] <hatseflats> JAAulde: I've traced some stackoverflow thread about this problem, seems silly to me but dialog('open') always tries to focus the first element :/
[07:21:01] <JAAulde> hatseflats: yes, i believe it does. like i said, they're expecting that a dialog should receive focus. i think we had the same issue as you describe once and got around it. we have another dialog with no inputs which is taking focus as well and we need to fix that too
[07:22:45] <nitrix> Hi, is it possible to get the current dom object with jquery, but to have the actual code in the onclick="" attribute ?
[07:22:54] <nitrix> Would $(this) work ?
[07:23:45] <JAAulde> nitrix: onclick="$(this).someJqFunc()" would work, though I must make the standard declaration that inline event handling is bad :)
[07:23:50] <xec> nitrix: any particular reason you want to use the onclick="" ?
[07:24:16] <xec> nitrix: also, define "current" DOM object
[07:24:20] <flat_eric> @JAAulde: have u any idea where it could come from except out of the database?
[07:24:25] <flat_eric> @JAAulde have u any idea where it could come from except out of the database?
[07:24:48] <nitrix> JAAulde: Yeah, I'm aware it's really bad, but I'm doing my possible with the mess they gave me. It worked fine, thank you man.
[07:24:55] <JAAulde> flat_eric: not at all, esp since I have never seen your PHP code. that said, I don't know that it's causing the problem.  what actually does happen when you click an event in your calendar?
[07:25:16] <JAAulde> nitrix: i figured you were aware, just have to do m y due dilligence ;)  no problem
[07:26:22] <flat_eric> JAAulde: an modal opens and shows the text, but not the associated values
[07:27:49] <flat_eric> JAAulde: i just write via json the values out of the db into the var $events in php
[07:28:01] <flat_eric> JAAulde: $events = json_encode($func->getAllData());
[07:28:20] <flat_eric> public function getAllData() {
[07:28:20] <flat_eric>         $this->db->query('SELECT * FROM Events');
[07:28:20] <flat_eric>         $result = $this->db->mysql_fetch_all();
[07:28:21] <flat_eric>         return $result;
[07:28:23] <flat_eric>     }
[07:28:38] <flat_eric> ups sorry. next time i do it in pastebin again
[07:30:18] <flat_eric> http://pastebin.com/JkkELxYk
[07:30:28] <flat_eric> and the fetchall funct
[07:32:38] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/6u7Mn/ anyone have any idea why this ajax fires sometimes and not others- if i clear my cache and try it, itdoesnt work.  i have to usually click refresh a bunch of times
[07:35:37] <JAAulde> hatseflats: i can't find anything specific in our stuff.  it's been a long time, and the other devs don't remember it. It looks like there is a new option coming in a future version of UI which will help with this as documented in the final comment of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4731
[07:36:05] <JAAulde> hatseflats: until then, perhaps you could do something in the dialog's open method to blur what got focused
[07:36:26] <JAAulde> flat_eric: what actually does happen when you click an event?
[07:37:06] <flat_eric> an modal opens and shows the text without the associated values
[07:37:47] <hatseflats> JAAulde: I'm trying as hard as I can, but no hook seems to defocus
[07:37:59] <hatseflats> otoh, hiding the widget I haven't tried
[07:38:32] <JAAulde> hatseflats: is your concern that an element with focus behavior is firing too early, or that somethign else in the DOM is locing focus?
[07:39:12] <JAAulde> flat_eric: does it work once, and then stop working?
[07:39:50] <flat_eric> JAAulde: nope. but the title works. http://pastebin.com/P65FBqsA that is whats in the object...
[07:39:52] <hatseflats> JAAulde: my specific concern is that the widget pops up when it should be a clean slate, whether the field actually has focus doesn't specifically bother me
[07:40:36] <JAAulde> hatseflats: i see. well, it seems to be a common issue which UI plans to address.  Wish I could be of more help.
[07:41:04] <hatseflats> JAAulde: no problem, you did help though :)
[07:41:43] <JAAulde> hatseflats: you could look at some of the StackOverlfow answers around this same issue in which people use document.activeElement to remember what had focus and give it back to it, or you could try calling .blur() on the element which got focus and see if that cleans things up for you
[07:42:22] <JAAulde> flat_eric: ok. do you get any JS errors at all? (which browser is this?)
[07:42:28] <hatseflats> JAAulde: if I 'return' focus to the previously focussed element the dialog stops responding altogether, that's not working
[07:42:39] <JAAulde> hatseflats: ugh, suck
[07:42:41] <flat_eric> JAAulde: its chrome and i get no errors
[07:42:58] <flat_eric> JAAulde: but it doesn't working in firefox as well
[07:43:05] <hatseflats> what I did manage to do however is hide the popup after it shows up, but it'll flash on screen for 50ms, and my boss won't accept that solution :p
[07:43:09] <hatseflats> nor will our clients
[07:44:04] <JAAulde> flat_eric: ok, not sure what else I can do at this point. I suggest you do some debugging in the Chrom or Firebug consoles in which you use break poits to step through event click, or console.log statements to dump valus and. either way, youshould be looking to see that your jQuery selectors are matching the targeted elements, and that your event object holds that data you expect during the execution of the handler
[07:44:17] <JAAulde> hatseflats: understood. soory man
[07:44:54] <JAAulde> flat_eric, hatseflats: i have to run now, sorry i can't be of more help. have a good (better) day!
[07:45:16] <flat_eric> JAAulde: alright, thanks alot

[08:15:55] <sunbeam> comment contents?
[08:15:56] <sunbeam> should it be <article> ? anyone
[08:17:13] <anew> if you use jQuery instead of $ what is that doing ?
[08:17:19] <NodeX> anew : $ was probably being taken over
[08:17:44] <DukeDrake> $('body').addClass('extrastyle');
[08:18:21] <DukeDrake> with the class 'extrastyle' having the style for overflow ... and background color .... which dosn't change either
[08:18:31] <shoky> sunbeam: <article> is fine yeah
[08:18:52] <anew> nodex and jQuery cant ever be taken over ?
[08:18:59] <anew> jQuery.()
[08:19:21] <shoky> sunbeam: you can nest the comments <article>s inside the main <article>
[08:19:58] <shoky> maybe with a <section> surrounding the comments
[08:20:28] <AaronCampbell> I see that $(element).data('events') was removed in 1.8.  What's the proper way to get a list of events attached to an element?
[08:21:00] <AaronCampbell> The release notes say you can use this for debugging: $._data(element, "events")
[08:21:22] <AaronCampbell> But I'm wondering if that means there's a better way to loop through the events
[08:23:21] <shoky> AaronCampbell: there isn't a better way afaik
[08:24:17] <shoky> AaronCampbell: and as the notes say, it should only be used for debugging purposes if at all.
[08:26:26] <DukeDrake> $('body').addClass('extrastyle'); - works if entered in the console
[08:26:36] <DukeDrake> but not when executed in my js code :/
[08:26:59] <shoky> got a demo?
[08:28:41] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/6u7Mn/1/ please anyone knwo why this is not even sending the xhr request ?
[08:28:55] <jvanveen> hey
[08:28:58] <anew> the alert('testing'); fires, but then below nothing
[08:29:00] <anew> please
[08:29:01] <DukeDrake> no
[08:29:06] <jvanveen> $('.navbar a').on('click', function(event){} is always delegatish from 1.7 ?
[08:29:08] <DukeDrake> this is kind of odd ...
[08:29:37] <jvanveen> somehow the event isnt triggered(the html for the 'a' part is injected later)
[08:30:26] <anew> anyone? shoky ?
[08:30:36] <DukeDrake> ok, found the error -..
[08:30:59] <AaronCampbell> shoky: Yeah, the problem is that someone else's code isn't name spacing, so I was using .data('events') to loop through and remove it
[08:30:59] <katsh> is it possible to have a local ajaxStart?
[08:31:15] <NeDra> i just got a weird error... i got a select dropdownlist box, if i put it inside a jquery dialog i can't access it using $("#mySelect") but when it not inside the jqueyUI dialog, it just work? is that a normal behavior?
[08:31:23] <AaronCampbell> shoky: Thanks for the input though
[08:32:06] <NeDra> or is it that the jquery UI dialog doesn't update? it take a copy of what in the div
[08:32:10] <NeDra> oh that what happening...
[08:32:33] <NeDra> the jquery UI dialog take a copy of the div and push it into the dialog that popup
[08:32:55] <NeDra> is there any way to edit the content inside the div inside the dialog that has loaded?
[08:34:45] <shoky_> anew: i dunno.. no errors in console? nothing shows up in network tab?
[08:36:13] <anew> shoky nothing, i click it and get no errors and no xhr
[08:36:16] <NeDra> when i do $('#dialog').dialog(); it use a copy of the div #dialog to create the dialog, so does that mean i can't edit any object of the DOM inside the dialog with their ID? as it a copy? can't seem to find anyone talking about such a thing on google yet, will search some more
[08:36:17] <anew> v weird
[08:38:03] <katsh> Why is it not possible to have request.beforeSend(..) but you can have beforeSend:function() {..} inside the ajax object
[08:38:09] <armin_w> hello is there a version of jquery.Color Plugin that works with jQuery 1.7 ?
[08:38:26] <katsh> similarly, we have request.fail and request.done()
[08:40:01] <NeDra> okay figured how, it ugly but work
[08:40:17] <NeDra> i just recall $('#dialog').dialog(); after the data modified
[08:40:22] <NeDra> and it update the data in the dialog
[08:48:13] <sunbeam> shoky: yes
[08:48:15] <sunbeam> ok got it
[08:49:20] <codeshah> hey guys, I am trying to use jqfeed to get a feed uRL but it says moved 301 permantnelyt…. the /feed url works
[08:49:26] <codeshah> do I have to point to the original source or? weird.
[08:53:28] <djQuery> grrrr localStorage no work on android chrome
[09:00:48] <anew> ok a little close....
[09:00:59] <anew> i'm getting an ajax request as 'pending' in status of network
[09:01:01] <anew> wtf does that mean
[09:02:04] <teitoklein01> guys, I am using the jquery append $('#txtRegDay').append("<option>1</option>"); for adding option from a select input but when I call the action multiple times it didn't overwrite the previous one instead it produce 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.  how will i overwrite the previous one ?
[09:02:54] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ teitoklein01
[09:02:55] <bot-t> teitoklein01, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[09:03:44] <army> teitoklein01 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646317/how-can-i-check-whether-a-option-already-exist-in-select-by-jquery
[09:03:45] <teitoklein01> okay okay. wait for a minute
[09:04:36] <teitoklein01> maybe this one would do $("#yourSelect option[value='yourValue']").length > 0;

[09:18:04] <elpelo> hi guys
[09:18:37] <elpelo> im trying to print 2 variables but for some reason I only get the variable name instead of the value: http://jsfiddle.net/uxj36/
[09:18:52] <elpelo> height and width should print a number right?
[09:24:23] <aitiba__> hi
[09:24:35] <aitiba__> how can I do to can delete the first <h3> tag of a page?
[09:25:24] <donburks> $("h3").first().remove()
[09:26:27] <elpelo> donburks: can you take a look at my fiddle?
[09:26:38] <elpelo> it must be a simple mistake or something
[09:26:51] <donburks> I just did. Why are you doing .attr("width") instead of .width()?
[09:28:10] <elpelo> donburks: cause after the carousel is initiated the element's width changes so i need to get it before
[09:28:30] <elpelo> from the attribute instead of the actual value
[09:29:02] <elpelo> what i dont understand is why the variable is being ignored. If i do something like alert(ancho); i'll get the number
[09:29:44] <donburks> Where is it being ignored?
[09:30:00] <elpelo> height: porcentaje ,
[09:30:01] <aitiba__> donburks, thanks!
[09:30:09] <donburks> Yw.

[09:32:11] <elfatguy> would you guys happen to know where I can hire someone for a small jquery job (debugging), that isnt from india who knows what theyre doing
[09:32:32] <elfatguy> I have some sliders on a side, that wont slide in FF or safari and would like to get that problem solved
[09:32:38] <elfatguy> side -> site
[09:32:40] <LindsayMac> elfatguy:  here is a good place to start
[09:33:13] <elfatguy> I was going to just ask some ops but it appears there arent any :)
[09:33:20] <elpelo> donburks: anocho, alto, and porcentaje will print a number on alert. If I try to pass them on to .carouFredSel options, only the name of the variable instead of the value will appear
[09:34:00] <LindsayMac> elfatguy:  there are.. they're incognito ;)
[09:35:48] <chrisbolton_> I pulled this from a js.erb file, anyone know how I can convert it to a js.coffee file ? $('<%= j render("users") %>')
[09:35:53] <dblosevn> elfatguy: pm me, i may have a few minutes to help from Florida not india lol
[09:42:32] <Absolute0> Is there a "finally" callback for $.ajax? I want it to run after the ajax request completes (successful, or not--sort of like the java finally block).
[09:43:38] <amcsi_work> Is there a shorter way of passing the results of promises back for deferreds? I keep having to write http://pastebin.com/mF9tKcet
[09:43:41] <Brodingo> Absolute0 i believe that would be complete
[09:44:06] <Brodingo> ?ajax @ Absolute0
[09:44:07] <bot-t> Absolute0, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

[10:20:13] <anew> anyone know how to fix pending ajax requests ?
[10:20:34] <eddiemonge> fix?
[10:21:55] <anew> imean it's not suposed to be pending XD
[10:22:02] <anew> it just sits there and hangs indefinitely
[10:22:07] <eddiemonge> how is it pending?
[10:22:45] <anew> network tab - status - pending
[10:22:59] <eddiemonge> anew: thats a problem with your server or source then
[10:23:34] <anew> what should i be looking for ?
[10:24:40] <softarn> hey, is there any guide for how I use my jQuery ui that i downloaded?
[10:25:08] <eddiemonge> anew: look at your server logs, maybe its throwing an error or something
[10:25:18] <eddiemonge> softarn: yeah, in the zip there are demos
[10:25:41] <elpelo> donburks: my connection went down
[10:25:52] <donburks> That's okay, I got swamped with work.
[10:26:05] <elpelo> oh, haha cool then
[10:26:52] <donburks> elpelo: I don't know why it would be passing them as strings, instead of the values. The only way that "should" happen is if you're putting them in quotes.
[10:27:36] <elpelo> donburks: yeah, i was reading about that, but afaik they aren't inside quotes :S
[10:30:27] <softarn> isn't it possible to just point to the css and the new css will be used?
[10:34:11] <aravindSrivats7> hi. i've got around 4 seperate ajax calls to submit a form in php.  when the ajax is called, the php executes and my database updates. but a 404 Not found is returned by the ajax. what could be wrong?
[10:36:29] <aravindSrivats7> http://jsfiddle.net/rrra6/
[10:36:44] <aravindSrivats7> all my ajax follows the same pattern as the above fiddle
[10:37:05] <eddiemonge> softarn: yes
[10:37:21] <eddiemonge> aravindSrivats7: what is the response from the server?
[10:37:34] <aravindSrivats7> i get a 404 Not found
[10:37:51] <aravindSrivats7> but the php executes and update the database with that in the form
[10:37:54] <softarn> something is wrong with my download, opening the index file in the root everything is white and black and looks like notepad
[10:38:59] <eddiemonge> aravindSrivats7: ok then you need to fix the server end
[10:39:31] <aravindSrivats7> but doesnt 404, mean that the file is not present?
[10:41:13] <eddiemonge> aravindSrivats7: http://jsfiddle.net/rrra6/1/
[10:41:23] <eddiemonge> aravindSrivats7: what does the server response say in the network tab of the console?
[10:41:35] <eddiemonge> softarn: what did you download?
[10:41:50] <softarn> themeroller
[10:41:56] <softarn> new one seems good
[10:42:07] <softarn> but trying to use it myself it says loading in the bottom
[10:42:39] <softarn> and the css is wrong
[10:42:40] <softarn> hm
[10:44:06] <eddiemonge> link?
[10:46:11] <softarn> to my site? it's only local
[10:46:48] <saltcod> Before I spend days going down this rabbit hole......Anyone know of a jQuery plugin that does that nice slideup effect on Brackets:    http://brackets.io/    [ the innovative / open / focused / extensible part ]
[10:47:33] <eddiemonge> softarn: you cant put it online to test it?
[10:48:14] <eddiemonge> saltcod: its basically a tab setup with the tabs on the side with slide to open
[10:48:43] <saltcod> eddiemonge: that's very true
[10:48:45] <saltcod> thanks!
[10:48:49] <warrenparsons> saltcod: scrollTo + an overflowed div will make that pretty simple.
[10:49:09] <saltcod> true as well warrenparsons:
[10:49:39] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Heck, you could probably do it all in CSS if you wanted.
[10:49:48] <saltcod> IE7?
[10:50:03] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Better use scrollTo ;)
[10:50:07] <saltcod> =)
[10:50:30] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Although you could probably do it all except the smooth scrolling in CSS for IE7 as well.
[10:50:51] <warrenparsons> saltcod: So if you're okay with it losing the animation...
[10:51:19] <saltcod> what's the basic idea of doing it in css?
[10:51:24] <saltcod> what/how
[10:51:26] <KA__> Hi gang
[10:51:36] <aravindSrivats7> eddiemonge: thanks. the dataType fixed it.
[10:51:48] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Using anchors. Links to #div1, #div2, etc.
[10:51:50] <KA__> total noob here I have a slider hover question
[10:52:02] <saltcod> Right right right warrenparsons
[10:52:03] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Then adding transitions for the scrolling...
[10:52:20] <warrenparsons> saltcod: It might get tricky. I'm just sorta thinking out loud.
[10:52:28] <KA__> while sliding the hover of other sliders still gets activated http://pastebin.com/f83Kr46r
[10:52:34] <saltcod> sounds interesting
[10:52:47] <KA__> anyway to constrain that or turn off default behavior while sliding
[10:52:54] <warrenparsons> saltcod: I've done it with a horizontal scroller and HTML/CSS only before. No smooth transitions.
[10:53:21] <warrenparsons> saltcod: That was before CSS transitions were reasonably widely available.
[10:53:40] <saltcod> True. I'm probably better with jQuery — IE7&8 are the primary market
[10:53:42] <saltcod> #ug
[10:54:00] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Yeah. But it's fun to see what you can reproduce without JS.
[10:54:10] <saltcod> that's true too =)
[10:55:09] <warrenparsons> saltcod: I think by setting the container to overflow: hidden, and then using anchor links, it'll handle everything except the animations. I think that's how I did it before.
[10:56:19] <NeDra> saltcod: What you want ---> [Magic box] --> Working final project
[10:56:21] <NeDra> easiest method
[10:56:36] <warrenparsons> NeDra: You know where I can get one of those?
[10:56:47] <saltcod> Yeah, jquery.magicbox.min.js
[10:56:52] <warrenparsons> LOL
[10:56:55] <warrenparsons> If only.
[10:57:12] <NeDra> there a few that would work for a hand full of rice and you put them in a box and pass your work to them >.>
[10:57:27] <NeDra> anyway back to work, i was on a break
[11:00:10] <saltcod> This the general idea warrenparsons: ?
[11:00:11] <saltcod> http://cl.ly/image/0w0N0n3n1a1N
[11:00:14] <Theowning> Anyone know a fix for transitions flickering using jQueryMobile 1.2 on android 4.1?
[11:01:19] <warrenparsons> saltcod: There would be another wrapper around the three panels, set to height of "in view" with overflow set to hidden.
[11:01:48] <Theowning> Also, the jQuery Mobile site needs an update, it still says to join #jquerymobile
[11:01:53] <eddiemonge> Theowning: yeah. dont use android?
[11:02:07] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Anyway, you'll use the same setup with scrollTo, so none of this is wasted effort.
[11:03:47] <eddiemonge> Theowning: its on the agenda now
[11:05:17] <saltcod> something like this then http://cl.ly/image/0l2U2h3b433b warrenparsons:
[11:14:44] <warrenparsons> saltcod: More like http://i.imgur.com/uUTZf.png
[11:15:04] <warrenparsons> saltcod: That keeps the panels scrolling independently of the links.
[11:15:55] <warrenparsons> saltcod: Your horizontal blue rectangle could go away.
[11:18:28] <anew> bah i cant figure out this ajax pending request, it justsits there ?
[11:23:52] <eddiemonge> anew: what happens if you go to that page without the ajax part? or load the response in a new tab?
[11:25:18] <mobile8> $.each(list_data, function(k, v) { }
[11:25:26] <mobile8> this is a multidimensional array (json)
[11:25:34] <mobile8> how can i best get all values for each v ?
[11:25:42] <mobile8> (v is an array of 7 values )
[11:27:17] <anew> eddiemonge i figured it out, it's a 301 https issue
[11:27:30] <anew> i changed the url to https, but get a new error is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[11:27:33] <anew> so have to google that now
[11:28:12] <hlve> How would I wrap all of the child elements inside of a div?
[11:28:35] <eddiemonge> mobile8: multiple loops
[11:28:38] <Brodingo> ?wrapall @ hlve
[11:28:39] <bot-t> hlve, .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[11:28:44] <saltcod> aah I see warrenparsons: thanks!
[11:28:48] <eddiemonge> anew: jsonp
[11:29:09] <anew> jsonp ?
[11:29:11] <warrenparsons> saltcod: No problem.
[11:30:00] <mobile8> eddiemonge: ok so 2 .each?
[11:30:29] <hlve> i think I asked the question incorrectly
[11:31:35] <eddiemonge> mobile8: or you could use a normal for loop
[11:31:47] <eddiemonge> ?jsonp @ anew
[11:31:48] <bot-t> anew, JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[11:32:33] <MistuhKurtz> can anyone recommend a quick-reference guide for CSS3 properties and the values they can accept? Also, for native javascript objects.
[11:33:45] <MistuhKurtz> oftentimes w3schools is the easiest to get a quick look at a js object's methods & properties. MDN is too verbose. I just want a quick reference that's very user friendly
[11:34:42] <anew> so can i just make datatype jsonp and that's it ?
[11:37:25] <donburks> MistuhKurtz: http://dochub.io/#css/
[11:39:13] <MistuhKurtz> awesome! thanks a ton donburks
[11:39:19] <donburks> Np. :)
[11:39:43] <shoky> anew: the server has to support it
[11:40:05] <anew> argh sounds like a pain in the ass for crosssite ajax
[11:40:13] <shoky> anew: is the server under your control?
[11:40:24] <shoky> anew: a better solution is CORS
[11:40:35] <anew> cors?
[11:40:44] <shoky> anew: all you gotta do for it is enable a header in your server
[11:40:50] <shoky> yes, cors
[11:40:55] <shoky> ?g enable cors
[11:40:56] <bot-t> shoky, enable cross-origin resource sharing - http://enable-cors.org/
[11:41:09] <anew> is all of this secure ?
[11:41:40] <donburks> Is anything? </marvin>
[11:41:41] <shoky> eh..
[11:42:03] <shoky> anew: it's as secure as http requests get ;S
[11:42:03] <anew> well some stuff worse than others right lol
[11:42:32] <donburks> It's all relative.
[11:42:36] <donburks> Unless it's an absolute URL.
[11:43:14] <eddiemonge> cors is fine. unless you care about ie7
[11:43:14] <shoky> and if you're worried about security then you really need to read up on it .. if i say "yes its secure" that doesnt mean shit..
[11:46:35] <mobile8> get array values by key title, how can i best do this?
[11:47:15] <shoky> mobile8: what do you mean
[11:49:10] <mobile8> shoky: $.each(this, function(k, data) { alert(data["title"])); }
[11:49:13] <mobile8> whats wrong with this
[11:49:40] <shoky> what's  'this'?
[11:49:51] <shoky> and.. what do you mean, what's wrong with this
[11:51:33] <mobile8> data["title"]
[11:51:35] <shoky> well one thing that's wrong with it is an extra )
[11:51:37] <mobile8> this is an array
[11:52:03] <shoky> data["title"] is an array?
[11:52:10] <mobile8> no its a value
[11:52:22] <shoky> .. ok
[11:52:22] <mobile8> wait i paste bin

[11:55:22] <b1lly> $('selector').find('firstselector,secondselector'); ?
[11:55:33] <b1lly> .toggle()

[11:55:40] <UltraMC> donburks, do you realise you gave broken fiddle?
[11:56:07] <donburks> UltraMC: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/donburks/4U9ka/3/
[11:57:31] <shoky> mobile8: alert(data)
[11:57:34] <anew> are there any security issues with having this in htacces? Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
[11:57:36] <anew> ?
[11:57:56] <shoky> mobile8:  k == 'title', data == 'Something'
[11:58:32] <mobile8> shoky: oh sorry your right
[11:58:43] <mobile8> shoky: i'd like to access the array values by title for each array
[11:58:51] <mobile8> shoky: i got 10 of these arrsy
[11:58:52] <mobile8> arrays
[11:59:28] <shoky> mobile8: you can search the array for the object with some title
[11:59:56] <shoky> mobile8: see $.grep
[12:00:08] <mobile8> shoky: thanks!
[12:01:28] <shoky> mobile8: and $.map might come in handy sometime too
[12:02:13] <goddard> how can i use a selector with a variable?
[12:02:21] <hectron> Hey guys, I was wondering if jqueryUI requires the newest version of jQuery?
[12:02:45] <hectron> I have a website that uses jQuery 1.3 and would like to use the latest version of jQuery UI without having to update my jQuery.
[12:02:59] <goddard> like $("."+variableName).remove(); ?
[12:03:01] <mobile8> shoky: hmm i dont seee how i can search fot title (the key) with grep?
[12:04:00] <shoky> hectron: newest jquery UI supports jquery 1.6+
[12:04:15] <shoky> hectron: 1.3 is really old
[12:04:40] <hectron> shoky: Indeed. Thanks for the tip. I just read that on the front page of jqueryui.com
[12:04:41] <hectron> Hah.
[12:06:08] <shoky> mobile8: var objectsWithCoolTitle = $.grep(jsonArr, function(obj) { return obj.title == 'COOL TITLE' })
[12:06:26] <mobile8> shoky: yea thnx
[12:07:05] <goddard> any idea?
[12:07:15] <shoky> goddard: you did it fine
[12:12:06] <goddard> odd its not removing my row
[12:12:26] <goddard> oh duh its a id not a class
[12:14:25] <mobile8> ShadeTornado: whats the proper js operator?
[12:14:31] <mobile8> html += "something" ?
[12:14:33] <mobile8> or =+
[12:14:36] <mobile8> bot hdont work for me
[12:14:53] <shoky> ?
[12:15:11] <mobile8> concat
[12:15:14] <shoky> there's +=
[12:15:15] <mobile8> add to var html
[12:15:50] <mobile8> ok thanks
[12:16:23] <zowen> if i do a find(selector).each on a container, and during that loop i append elements to the container, will it continue looping into those elements, or will it stop at the original end?
[12:17:19] <shoky> zowen: the .find(selector) happens once, before the .each(). it won't add new elements to the loop
[12:17:50] <zowen> shoky: thanks
[12:19:14] <Xeon06_> Hey guys
[12:19:31] <Drager> Is it possible on this; http://jsfiddle.net/YW5P4/ so the "Show" and "Hide" goes after how the content is display. Try to spam the button and you'll see.
[12:19:32] <Xeon06_> I'm trying to specify a custom queue using .animate, but when I do my animation doesn't start. Do I need to do something in particular?
[12:30:42] <shoky> Xeon06_: you need to manually .dequeue(..) it
[12:40:08] <mobile8> whats the fastest way to check if a var has value (more than "")
[12:41:08] <ForSpareParts> Is there a particularly well-regarded plugin/library for search suggestions via JSON, or do most developers just roll their own?
[12:49:51] <awc737> how can I say if ( value.property.indexOf("string") !== -1  ?
[12:49:56] <awc737> the period in value.property seems to break indexOf
[12:50:43] <shoky_> awc737: what's the problem? and what's value.property
[12:51:37] <awc737>  value.property === "Some string";
[12:52:16] <awc737> if ( value.property.indexOf("string") !== -1 ) {alert('found');}    <- does not work

[13:14:31] <UltraMC> thx
[13:14:40] <MistuhKurtz> you had a . in your class attribute
[13:16:02] <Drager> Is it possible on this; http://jsfiddle.net/YW5P4/ so the "Show" and "Hide" goes after how the content is display. Try to spam the button and you'll see.
[13:18:06] <eddiemonge> Drager: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/YW5P4/1/
[13:20:57] <mobile8> Something strange, when I fill a #id with html using $("#someid").html(html_var);
[13:21:10] <mobile8> The hover effect (fading in the overlay of some element) doesnt work anyjmore
[13:21:33] <mobile8> any ideas? the html code is correct, when i use the same html at load the fadeIn works

[13:23:38] <rmill> hayyyy gaaals
[13:24:09] <MattBrotz> Question, if I have a php file that I'm going to send a ajax request to, but it is "denied from all", with a .htaccess  file, should this not work? How can I still protect the file?
[13:24:17] <eddiemonge> mobile8: is the hover effect in the content? you have to re-link it
[13:24:40] <eddiemonge> MattBrotz: denied from all means its denied to all
[13:24:51] <Drager> eddiemonge: That make the button to disapear aswell. Looks kinda bad, well thanks for your effort though.
[13:25:26] <MattBrotz> eddiemonge: would it be possible to just deny it from users and not my requests?
[13:25:31] <eddiemonge> Drager: then you need to disable the animations or the button until it is done
[13:25:40] <eddiemonge> MattBrotz: not really. you could add authentication
[13:25:47] <mobile8> eddiemonge: yes it is
[13:25:50] <mobile8> eddiemonge: relink as in
[13:26:04] <MattBrotz> eddiemonge: with what? htpassword?
[13:26:19] <MattBrotz> or some php thing?
[13:26:24] <sheilablackrose> hi how can i specifine the line spacing for overflow
[13:26:41] <mobile8> eddiemonge: i see what you mean
[13:26:47] <Drager> eddiemonge: Yeah okey. Any fast idea how to do it?
[13:26:49] <mobile8> eddiemonge: looks kinda ugly, but see no other option
[13:27:43] <eddiemonge> mobile8: recall as all the content is replaced
[13:27:51] <mobile8> eddiemonge: yes thats what i do now
[13:27:52] <eddiemonge> ? on live @ mobile8
[13:27:53] <bot-t> mobile8, .live() - Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:28:02] <eddiemonge> but dont use live
[13:28:14] <mobile8> eddiemonge: ok why not?
[13:28:14] <relipse> i have a wierd question, I am adding a click() event after the page is loaded and it doesn't do anything, if, however, I copy the same code in the chrome js console, it adds the onclick event, what is the problem?
[13:28:35] <eddiemonge> MattBrotz: you have to take into account that anything passed in from the front end is visible
[13:29:00] <eddiemonge> Drager: replace the hide with .prop("disabled", "disabled") and the show with the opposite
[13:29:13] <MattBrotz> eddiemonge: Ok I understand what I have to do.
[13:29:15] <MattBrotz> Thanks
[13:29:23] <eddiemonge> mobile8: read that page and you will see why not
[13:29:28] <relipse> ok fine fallback i'll use onclick="" which also works
[13:29:39] <eddiemonge> relipse: same thing as mobile8
[13:29:46] <mobile8> eddiemonge: so use .on?
[13:29:47] <eddiemonge> you are trying to bind to things that dont exist yet
[13:29:53] <eddiemonge> relipse: are you using .ready() ?
[13:30:13] <eddiemonge> mobile8: yes
[13:30:18] <mobile8> eddiemonge: .live works for me
[13:30:19] <mobile8> .on doesnt
[13:30:27] <eddiemonge> mobile8: read .on and the delegation
[13:30:29] <relipse> eddiemonge: i dont know i'm using $(function(){ });
[13:30:31] <eddiemonge> on replaces live.
[13:30:32] <angrywombat> this might be better asked in #javascript but it involves jquery.. i have a click event for an image class that loads a new image (like a halfassed slideshow).. the problem is that this.onerror(..) is being triggered even when the image doesnt 404 (seemingly randomly). anyone experience anything like this before?
[13:30:47] <eddiemonge> relipse: are you adding content to the page and trying to bind in that?
[13:30:52] <eddiemonge> relipse: and thats a shortcut for ready
[13:31:06] <mobile8> eddiemonge: i do ? dont understand
[13:31:11] <eddiemonge> angrywombat: code?
[13:31:18] <eddiemonge> ?on
[13:31:19] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:31:25] <relipse> eddiemonge: yes then i'm using .read()
[13:31:27] <relipse> ready()
[13:31:44] <relipse> yeah the turnjs is modifying a lot of the html and stuff
[13:31:52] <relipse> so maybe i need to set a timer
[13:31:58] <eddiemonge> mobile8: read the bold stuff in http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:32:01] <relipse> which to me osunds ridiculous
[13:32:08] <eddiemonge> relipse: you read it too
[13:32:20] <angrywombat> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/eVFjVMZ8
[13:32:38] <mobile8> eddiemonge: ok
[13:32:43] <mobile8> eddiemonge: though i dont get the examples
[13:32:55] <Drager> eddiemonge: hm
[13:33:16] <b1lly> whats the difference between .bind, .on, and .live
[13:33:34] <eddiemonge> $("PARENTTHATEXISTS").on("EVENT", "CHILDTHATISADDED", function() {  //do stuff  });
[13:33:57] <eddiemonge> b1lly:  live is deprecated. bind internally calls on
[13:35:06] <eddiemonge> angrywombat: its probably triggering because its called async
[13:35:32] <mobile8> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/MntzByfU
[13:35:39] <mobile8> eddiemonge: whats wrong here?
[13:35:47] <relipse> ok this is absolutely ridiculous
[13:36:25] <noregret> how can i check if a certain json key exists ? e.g. json.val1
[13:36:59] <noregret> json.val1 != '' is giving true even though it doesn't exist
[13:38:25] <relipse> in $(function(){ , I add some code to add an onclick event to a <div>, nothing happens, if I paste the exact same .click() event inside of google chrome js console, it adds the onclick event successfully. I tried doing a setTimeout() for 2 seconds later in ready() but it STILL does not add the event. Any jquery gurus know what the problem is?

[13:43:40] <mobile8> thanks a lot
[13:44:48] <relipse> i think i'm going to have to back out of jquery on this one
[13:44:55] <relipse> and resourt to onclick=""
[13:44:57] <mobile8> eddiemonge: also another question, do you know how I can clone an array?
[13:45:04] <elpaisag> hi guys
[13:45:18] <mobile8> i mean add the same array keys to an exsiting one
[13:45:42] <noregret> eddiemonge: i came up with if (json.val1 && json.val1 != '') which is better?
[13:46:22] <elpelo> Could someone please take a look at this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/GNKgZ/ and try to point me out on why the variables i have declared won't show they're value afterwards on the function options?
[13:46:31] <eddiemonge> relipse: really? my example for mobile8 doesnt help you at all?

[13:46:53] <eddiemonge> wait, thats elements
[13:47:10] <eddiemonge> noregret: depends on what you are checking for
[13:47:30] <noregret> eddiemonge: just if it exists and contains soemthing
[13:47:37] <relipse> eddiemonge: i know how to use jquery, it is this odd example where turnjs is not working with jquery properly
[13:47:55] <mobile8> eddiemonge: thnx
[13:50:19] <eddiemonge> noregret: yours is fine then
[13:50:49] <eddiemonge> relipse: well good luck to you
[13:51:10] <noregret> eddiemonge: should it be != '' or !=='' or it doesn't matter in tihs case
[13:51:41] <eddiemonge> depends on what you are checking against
[13:52:05] <shoky> if (json.val1 && json.val1 != '')    <-- one of those is redundant
[13:52:16] <noregret> eddiemonge: the key could contain anything
[13:52:31] <noregret> shoky: key might exit but empty...
[13:52:37] <noregret> exist *
[13:53:33] <shoky> noregret: doesn't matter, both empty and undefined and not-exists are all false
[13:53:48] <cantonic> hey guys and girls. can someone help me with this loop? https://gist.github.com/4280310
[13:53:55] <shoky> if you check with !== then there's a difference
[13:54:00] <cantonic> i need to write a line of url per item in the result array
[13:54:20] <noregret> shoky: oh, then i shall keep it as json.val1 && json.val1 != ''
[13:54:46] <shoky> noregret:  sure but that's the same as if (json.val1)
[13:55:40] <shoky> false == ''
[13:55:48] <shoky> == undefined == null == 0
[13:55:53] <noregret> shoky: ah sorry, i misunderstood you, fixed now, thanks
[13:57:17] <eddiemonge> var a = "0"; if ( a ) { console.log("hello"); }
[13:57:32] <shoky> "0" == true
[13:57:34] <shoky> er
[13:57:53] <shoky> scratch that.
[13:57:55] <eddiemonge> sorry no quotes around the "0"
[13:58:28] <eddiemonge> noregret: so id keep the !== ""
[13:59:54] <MistuhKurtz> ?eval var a = "0"; if(a){ return true; }
[13:59:55] <bot-t> MistuhKurtz: SyntaxError: return not in function

[14:00:41] <cantonic> eddiemonge: you don't like it?
[14:00:47] <eddiemonge> not really
[14:01:03] <MistuhKurtz> ?eval (function(){ var a = "0"; if(a){ return true; } })();

[14:01:23] <bot-t> MistuhKurtz: undefined
[14:01:54] <cantonic> eddiemonge: well, i like it because it is simpler and cleaner
[14:02:18] <cantonic> eddiemonge: would you be able to tell me what i am doing wrong in there?
[14:02:33] <eddiemonge> cantonic: only if you show me the actual js
[14:02:46] <cantonic> eddiemonge: ok. let me transform it into js
[14:03:59] <cantonic> eddiemonge: ok. added a second file to the gist: https://gist.github.com/4280310
[14:04:10] <shoky> looks like you put the return value of $.each into the eventSources array..
[14:04:13] <cantonic> eddiemonge: oops. sorry
[14:04:18] <cantonic> added wrong file
[14:04:24] <shoky> cantonic ^
[14:04:47] <cantonic> ok, updated it correctly.
[14:05:06] <cantonic> shoky: yes, what i want to do is adding multiple url-lines for each id
[14:05:08] <shoky> also why are you returning an object from inside $.each ..
[14:05:23] <cantonic> shoky: i don't know :( why am i?
[14:05:47] <shoky> i think you should skip coffeescript for now.
[14:05:54] <eddiemonge> what is result?
[14:06:03] <eddiemonge> oh jk
[14:07:04] <shoky> cantonic: maybe you want $.map instead of $.each
[14:07:13] <eddiemonge> cantonic: or you could do http://jsfiddle.net/rskgm/
[14:07:22] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am trying to figure out why when I change the way I pass arguments through jQuery UI Slider it will not animate when loaded, though when doing it one way it'll work. Problem is I have multiple sliders with different min/max so I need those attributes changed per slider AND animate when loaded. Right now it just loads the value and doesn't animate when passing min/max values. - http://jsfiddle.net/a9HeM/1/
[14:07:23] <shoky> cantonic: notice that the callback arguments have opposite order if you use $.map
[14:07:31] <cantonic> the result should be "url: "/calendars/1/events.json, url: "/calendars/2/events.json, url: "/calendars/3/events.json"
[14:07:57] <shoky> switch $.each for $.map
[14:08:12] <shoky> and remove the surrrouding [  ]
[14:08:24] <shoky> $.map will already return an array
[14:08:52] <firstclassfunc> hi
[14:08:59] <cantonic> let me try that out
[14:11:29] <firstclassfunc> I want to add a vertical scrollbar to a div, and I want width and height to both be 50%. I am styling using this: Is there a better way without using pixels? style="width: 200px; height: 800px; overflow: auto"
[14:11:37] <d3m0n> Anyone
[14:11:38] <otherj> guys, how can i refactor this so that success: only addclass to required fields?
[14:11:40] <otherj> https://gist.github.com/3c29ebd8787f9eedb40d
[14:11:45] <shoky> d3m0n you're not using the API right
[14:11:46] <d3m0n> I know it should be a fairly simple solutions
[14:11:47] <cantonic> works! thank you shoky and eddiemonge
[14:11:49] <eddiemonge> d3m0n: you initiate the sliders in the first chunk so you have to update the options in the other ones, otherwise, you are calling new sliders on them
[14:12:14] <d3m0n> shoky: is it because the UI doesnt accept min/max only value
[14:12:33] <eddiemonge> firstclassfunc: thats a #css question
[14:12:55] <firstclassfunc> yeah I asked there, they are dead
[14:12:57] <d3m0n> eddiemonge: I have to update all the options? aka orientation, rang animate?
[14:14:07] <shoky> d3m0n: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/a9HeM/2/
[14:14:40] <eddiemonge> d3m0n: yes. or create a default and extend it for each one
[14:15:34] <d3m0n> shoky: Perfection, thnx I didn't realize you would have to call slider again for each attribute
[14:16:11] <shoky> d3m0n the trick is to follow the docs, word for word, not assuming anything.
[14:16:27] <d3m0n> ha
[14:16:30] <shoky> they have examples for any kind of thing you want to set
[14:16:31] <d3m0n> well the examples only show value
[14:16:38] <shoky> nuh
[14:16:57] <d3m0n> http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[14:17:02] <shoky> for each property they show how you can set it on initialization and using the 'option' method
[14:17:06] <shoky> right.
[14:17:10] <shoky> it is highly detailed
[14:17:28] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-max

[14:17:59] * d3m0n right over my head
[14:20:38] <pierrelechelle> Hi guys, Do you know a nice grid plugin for jQuery / jQuery UI, with editing ? This is for invoicing, so I also need to be able to add text areas to the grid, any idea ? Thanks !
[14:21:58] <eddiemonge> d3m0n: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/a9HeM/3/
[14:22:21] <relipse> pierrelechelle: there are none, go to YUI 2.9 datatables (or YUI 3.x)
[14:22:42] <relipse> pierrelechelle: go to https://cworklog.com to see an example login test116 test116
[14:22:51] <d3m0n> Thanx eddiemonge I guess I was trying to clumb my code together and wasnt the way to go about it
[14:23:01] <d3m0n> clump*
[14:23:03] <eddiemonge> relipse: not true at all
[14:23:19] <pierrelechelle> relipse: Thanks! Do you know if the grids the jQuery UI team is developing will have those functionalities ?
[14:24:30] <eddiemonge> pierrelechelle: they will at some point
[14:25:01] <pierrelechelle> It seems their project is a bit in a "standby" mode, waiting for new jQuery release :/
[14:25:21] <eddiemonge> pierrelechelle: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5622716/choosing-a-jquery-datagrid-plugin
[14:25:24] <eddiemonge> pierrelechelle: it is.
[14:25:37] <otherj> i can't figure out how to make this not apply that class to any field that's changed :(
[14:25:48] <pierrelechelle> eddiemonge: Yeah, I already found out this topic...
[14:26:41] <pierrelechelle> eddiemonge: Datables seemed to convince me just before i saw their Editor is paid
[14:27:46] <eddiemonge> otherj: huh?
[14:29:08] <otherj> eddie: https://gist.github.com/3c29ebd8787f9eedb40d the :success bit is being applied to all fields rather than just requited :(
[14:29:18] <eddiemonge> pierrelechelle: jquery is more for manipulating the dom and other such things. you are looking more for a UI library. jQuery UI doesn't yet have grids. if you want a mature product then yes, look at YUI. Or look at better alternatives like Dojo or ExtJS. I prefer Dojo
[14:30:33] <pierrelechelle> eddiemonge: I was also looking to that yeah… But those plugin are compatible ? I mean, can I call them on the same page ?
[14:31:42] <Anticom> hi all
[14:33:32] <Anticom> i'm using ajax to post some data to a php script. i'm getting the data from html5 data. Problem now is, that one string has a "ß" in it (german character). when i look at it in firebug i'm getting "ÃŸ" displayed for it. and my php script doesn't seem to be able to recognize it either. html, ajax request and php script are all in utf-8
[14:33:38] <eddiemonge> pierrelechelle:  those that i listed are libraries, not plugins
[14:33:46] <Anticom> is there any enconding method to avoid this problem
[14:33:47] <Anticom> ?
[14:34:08] <pierrelechelle> eddiemonge: recognize my error just after wrote it
[14:34:14] <eddiemonge> otherj: i feel like you are doing it wrong but i havent used it enough to know.
[14:34:59] <eddiemonge> Anticom: how are you getting that into the ajax post?
[14:36:00] <woopwoop> is there a way to listen for when one is actually entering or typing in an input field
[14:36:12] <woopwoop> not a simply focus on input field
[14:37:48] <eddiemonge> keyup, keypress, keydown
[14:37:59] <woopwoop> thanks
[14:44:50] <shoky> otherj: doesn't that need to be $(label)
[14:50:06] <otherj> i don't think so
[14:50:21] <otherj> you mean in function() ?
[14:50:26] <shoky> otherj: your code, with minor changes- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5RrGa/584/
[14:50:34] <otherj> oh, i see
[14:50:37] <otherj> you mean success:
[14:51:12] <otherj> let me modify this to see if it has a problem with non-required fields
[14:51:58] <otherj> hot damn
[14:52:26] <otherj> was it just the selector that created the problem?
[14:53:11] <shoky> i didnt really understand what problem you were talking about
[14:53:45] <shoky> but to make it function normally i added .removeClass too
[14:53:50] <otherj> my example applies the labels from the success: block to fields that aren't required
[14:54:51] <otherj> it's based on this:

[14:57:25] <ForSpareParts> Newbie question: How are the parameters to the function passed to a callback determined? For instance, there's some sample code on the .ajax api page showing request.done(function ( data ) {...}) -- where can I see what the API will pass as the "data" parameter?
[14:58:32] <otherj> bummer, doesn't work
[14:58:53] <eddiemonge> ForSpareParts: it says in there. or you can just do a console.log to see what you get
[14:59:14] <ForSpareParts> eddiemonge, Sorry, where does it say? On the API page?
[14:59:57] <eddiemonge> ForSpareParts: yes
[15:00:07] <eddiemonge> look at success
[15:00:42] <ForSpareParts> eddiemonge, Ah. Got it. Thanks!

[15:21:01] <khaan> hi guys, i need to make a sticky menu - one of those that when you scroll it stops scrolling at a decent height. Fact is i cant' work it out. Can anyone help me?
[15:24:09] <TrentonDAdams> khaan: That's just a sticky situation.  I wish I could help. :D
[15:24:18] <khaan> lol
[15:24:59] <TrentonDAdams> khaan: No, no, use the new acronym that I invented.  It's "twsf" That Was So Funny.
[15:25:25] <khaan> really funny - alas, i'm still miserable and solution-less
[15:25:47] <nFFF> khaan, you need to create a sticky menu?
[15:25:54] <khaan> yes.
[15:25:59] <nFFF> One that sticks to the top of the window when they scroll down?
[15:26:05] <khaan> exactly
[15:26:13] <nFFF> ?scrolltop
[15:26:14] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[15:26:23] <nFFF> ?scroll
[15:26:23] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[15:26:59] <khaan> yes, i was investigating. All i need though is something horribly simple that attachs a .fixed class to an object when scrolling past a fixed height
[15:27:11] <nFFF> so your menu can be made position:absolute; and have the .css({margin-top: $(window).scrollTop()}); on a scroll event
[15:27:38] <klusias> hello. is there any jquery alternative for this plugin: http://finnrudolph.de/ImageFlow/Examples ?
[15:27:48] <khaan> nFFF: can you make me a very very simple example, please?
[15:34:26] <nFFF> khaan
[15:34:26] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/KaP3Q/1/
[15:36:16] <khaan> nfff: this stays always to the top, does it? i would like it to scroll until it reaches the top (from say 200px of height as starting position) and then to stop, and to revert to its original position when scrolling down...
[15:36:22] <khaan> (thank you btw!!!)
[15:37:05] <nFFF> Yea that sticks to the top of the page
[15:37:23] <khaan> yes but it doesn't reverts to the original position, later
[15:37:39] <nFFF> Well it does in this example
[15:37:44] <nFFF> as it starts at the top
[15:38:06] <khaan> ok but in my layout the menu is not at the top :)
[15:38:12] <khaan> i was checking this: http://www.jay-han.com/2011/11/10/simple-smart-sticky-navigation-bar-with-jquery/
[15:38:15] <khaan> but it's not working
[15:38:24] <khaan> probably because of a different jquery version
[15:38:32] <khaan> it' snot working on my site i mean
[15:44:47] <goddard> how do you get json data
[15:44:53] <goddard> its just an array right?
[15:44:59] <d3m0n> Noob question but why would this work: http://pastebin.com/YFN0ETK5 but not: http://pastebin.com/MJrn3Bqn
[15:45:08] <goddard> how do i access the fields do i need to assign it to a variable first?
[15:46:24] <nFFF> its an object goddard
[15:46:24] <camonz_> hi, can I use animate to ease the page scrolling?
[15:46:35] <nFFF> you access it via '.' notation
[15:47:14] <nFFF> khaan, http://jsfiddle.net/KaP3Q/2/
[15:47:16] <camonz_> I'm making a parallax scroll by increasing the background-position on a header element; but the scrolling is choppy
[15:47:40] <nFFF> camonz_, you want to slow scrolling down basically?
[15:47:44] <khaan> nFFF: thanks for your time. checking immediately
[15:47:53] <nFFF> You'd have to override the default scroll
[15:48:03] <camonz_> so I'm trying to ease it; but doing .animate({'background-position': "50% " + offset + "%"}) does nothing
[15:49:09] <camonz_> nFFF: why override it? I already have an example when clicking a button which uses .animate({ scrollTop: ...}) and that scroll is not choppy
[15:49:26] <nFFF> becuase when someone scrolls with their mouse
[15:49:32] <nFFF> it doesn't move one pixel at a time usually
[15:49:37] <nFFF> which im guessing you wan
[15:49:58] <nFFF> scroll on a page with your computer and look how many pixels it jumps at a time
[15:50:05] <camonz_> nFFF: yes, something like that; which I guess would make the scroll look fluid
[15:50:06] <nFFF> is this what you mean by 'choppy'?
[15:50:11] <camonz_> yes
[15:50:21] <nFFF> so you need to override this
[15:50:33] <nFFF> and do it pragmatically at a scroll rate you find fluid
[15:50:47] <khaan> nfff: must be something wrong in my code, then. Your example doesn't in my page. Thanks for your time, again :)
[15:51:03] <nFFF> using $(window).scrollTop(oldvalue+1);
[15:51:27] <camonz_> nFFF: that's what I'm trying to do by using animate to ease the change in values

[16:03:29] <camonz_> nFFF: still setting it up; kind off, 1px is too slow
[16:03:52] <nFFF> yea so change the 1 in the code to whatever you want :)
[16:04:17] <nFFF> that should've been apparant :D
[16:05:57] <camonz_> nFFF: thanks :)

[16:17:56] <mlang> I have a quick question regarding disabling radio buttons: So, if I set .prop('disabled', true) to one of my buttons, I still can click it and it gets a checked value - any idea how I can prevent this?
[16:18:17] <khaan> ooook i'm back, can anyone help me to debug a thing?

[16:20:47] <mlang> coldhead: doing exactly this.
[16:20:51] <mlang> I still can click it.
[16:21:13] <mlang> Ah. and I know why.
[16:21:22] <mlang> Because.. I am overwriting my JavaScript with another function.
[16:21:25] <mlang> I feel stupid now.
[16:23:25] <coldhead> khaan: http://jsfiddle.net/GdANF/3/
[16:23:36] <coldhead> your selector was missing the . in .navbar

[16:29:39] <coldhead> bah i thought it showed the criteria
[16:29:44] <coldhead> it's domain, port and protocol

[18:01:29] <grafi> how do you mean acidjazz?
[18:02:04] <acidjazz> like a class in a div nested 3-4 levels deep inside th element im assigning my click handler to

[18:13:25] <acidjazz> now i just need the exact coordinates of the click
[18:14:46] <rcl> I am lost, my question must be a jquery question, please someone have mercy and help me haha :( I'm using this site that launches jwplayer with a variety of playlists and i'm trying to figure out what they are..  I ASSUME that jquery is responsible for fetching those URLs but I can't find them appear in HTML anywhere that I inspect. Does anyone have a minute to help? This is probably trivial
[18:15:45] <rcl> Even a workaround to figure out those URLs would be fine, I just need a few
[18:16:10] <Caelum> my .ajax call is not setting the accept header to json, I tried dataType: 'json' and accepts: 'application/json' but it won't do it
[18:42:17] <araneae> Keblarg! I've got a question. My stateUp is returning undefined. http://pastie.org/private/adelduugqql9b8iwa81mhg  When I change line 29 to be this rather than self it stops running, but I'm not sure how to get it to come back with the variables I'm attempting to grab without using a return and passing it.
[18:42:53] <sbs`> is anyone even answering these questions?
[18:44:09] <araneae> Someone was yesterday, and I usually sit in here for a couple of hours to answer ones I can :P
[19:13:48] <sbs`> anyone got a minute to help a brother out?
[19:14:55] <lenswipee> sbs`: hi cuz
[19:15:19] <sbs`> lenswipee: hey man
[19:15:44] <sbs`> lenswipee: can I PM?
[19:15:53] <lenswipee> sbs`: sure
[19:16:06] <grafi> secret business :P
[19:27:27] <milk> hellos. can anyone please advise on what basics i've gotten wrong for the $('#block-block-1').offset().top on http://brewster.thingsandstuff.org/projects ?
[19:28:04] <milk> it gives null, but the id is there..
[19:31:26] <Caelum> milk: are you loading jquery?
[19:32:48] <Caelum> milk: and if you are, is it in noConflict mode?
[19:37:16] <Caelum> I figured out my accept header problem, apparently my framework ignores multipart accept headers
[19:58:33] <sheilablackrose> is there a way to center a div?
[19:59:41] <Caelum> sheilablackrose: yeah with css, not really something you do with jquery
[20:06:13] <milk> Caelum: cheers, realised it needed a jQuery(document).ready
[20:07:10] <Caelum> milk: someone here started using some lib that uses prototype so I had to change all my $ to jQuery :(
[20:10:20] <Caelum> I suppose I could use something like $j, but they turned on the interpolate option in this template system so I have to use \$
[20:18:16] <grafi> thats when you start wrapping your stuff into a self executing function and pass in the jQuery object i believe Caelum
[20:19:29] <Caelum> grafi: yah I saw that trick, all jquery extensions use it to be compatible with noConflict mode
[20:20:03] <grafi> probably a good idea in general
[20:36:20] <ineedhalpplz> If I wanted to perform a function only after a certain condition had been met, similarly to $(document).ready but with maybe an event trigger? Is there a way to accomplish what I want? I'm semi new to jQuery
[20:36:35] <coldhead> what event are you waiting for?
[20:36:55] <ineedhalpplz> Images to be appended to a div dynamically, then intiate an instance of photoswipe
[20:37:40] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/ZTjuc/
[20:37:53] <coldhead> that's how you do a custom event
[20:38:06] <ineedhalpplz> Perfect man, thank you very much.
[20:38:11] <coldhead> if you can add that .trigger() to the code that is adding the images you should be solid
[20:38:21] <ineedhalpplz> I love this place, you guys are always helpful!
[20:39:26] <coldhead> yes, and being here keeps us off from rioting in the streets
[20:39:32] <coldhead> so it's good for everyone
[20:40:43] <ineedhalpplz> Haha true that, Would you be willing to further assist me, should I provide a fiddle?
[20:42:16] <coldhead> try me and see
[20:42:26] <coldhead> if it's too hard i'll pretend i don't speak english
[20:42:54] <ineedhalpplz> awesome, one sec. ¿Que?
[20:43:49] <coldhead> si amigo
[20:44:18] <ineedhalpplz> So basically, this is how Photoswipe is initiated, just stick inbetween <script> tags on my page. http://jsfiddle.net/ZTjuc/1/ It doesn't run, but maybe you can show me what I did wrong or is it just that photoswipe isn't loaded into jQuery?
[20:44:27] <ineedhalpplz> Hell I'm thinking the latter
[20:45:38] <jessica_> need to learn how to implement this -  http://www.jtable.org/GettingStarted?ref=homebuttons
[20:45:47] <jessica_> someone have 10 minutes /
[20:46:09] <coldhead> yes, photoswipe is not part of jquery
[20:46:25] <coldhead> you need to load that from a separate file
[20:46:30] <coldhead> which i assume they provide
[20:46:33] <ineedhalpplz> Well I got that, lol I have it in my document but how can I load it into jsfiddle is what I'm getting at?
[20:47:03] <coldhead> on the left hand side, choose Add Resource
[20:47:07] <coldhead> and hotlink to the JS
[20:47:12] <coldhead> on a server somewhere
[20:47:20] <ineedhalpplz> ahh okay cool
[20:48:32] <UltraMC> Hi, how to select just one DIV here: http://jsfiddle.net/PJmrx/

[20:49:15] <Foxhoundz> the first one?

[20:52:57] <coldhead> UltraMC: http://jsfiddle.net/PJmrx/2/
[20:53:11] <coldhead> hey monk3y, always a pleasure
[20:53:14] <UltraMC> coldhead, yeah! :D
[20:53:19] <monk3y> Of course jessica_, I can try.
[20:53:32] <jessica_> need to learn how to implement this -  http://www.jtable.org/GettingStarted?ref=homebuttons
[20:53:40] <monk3y> But, if through the course of our conversation I deduce that you're not really a female, I may try a little less harder to help.
[20:53:40] <aqeel> hi room
[20:53:50] <MiracleBlue> monk3y: boom
[20:53:55] <coldhead> UltraMC: each() isn't that slow if you only have 3 elements, i wouldn't worry about optimisation until it's noticeably slow
[20:53:57] <UltraMC> coldhead, what is this ':has(*)' ?
[20:53:57] <monk3y> (j/k)
[20:53:59] <jessica_> lol, surely :)
[20:53:59] <coldhead> hi aqeel
[20:54:03] <coldhead> ?has @ UltraMC
[20:54:04] <bot-t> UltraMC, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[20:54:15] <coldhead> it filters out the elements that have any (*) children
[20:54:27] <UltraMC> cool
[20:54:31] <UltraMC> thanx bro
[20:54:36] <coldhead> you are very welcome
[20:54:37] <coldhead> have fun
[20:55:00] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[20:55:02] <coldhead> how offensive monk3y :P
[20:55:12] <aqeel> i would like to extend its functionality
[20:55:29] <coldhead> ?extend @ aqeel
[20:55:30] <bot-t> aqeel, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[20:55:42] <aqeel> i would like to add...toTop: and toBottom:
[20:56:05] <aqeel> thnaks
[20:57:51] <aqeel> how do one detect if it is top of page or end of page
[20:58:23] <coldhead> var topOfPage = confirm("Is it at the top of the page? Click Okay for Yes, Cancel for No")
[21:00:07] <monk3y> hahah
[21:00:15] <monk3y> coldhead, that's . ..uh . .. cold.
[21:05:48] <aqeel> well within the plugin there is already edge detection, how can i make use of it and add few more methods, like toTop: when someone clicks a given element it scrolls to top, as well as the opposite toBottom:
[21:06:32] <aqeel> this is my first try at extending the plugins
[21:08:33] <coldhead> aqeel: my approach would be to add toTop and toBottom and copy the exact code from toLeft and toRight, just so you can get new methods working
[21:08:57] <coldhead> once that was working i'd trying changing the code to match top instead of left
[21:09:02] <coldhead> and then repeat for bottom/right
[21:09:23] <coldhead> that's based on not looking at the ode and never having extended a plugin
[21:09:23] <coldhead> code*
[21:09:34] <coldhead> it's still the best advice you've got so far
[21:09:50] <aqeel> thanks, at leastr i know where to begin with now
[21:10:12] <coldhead> is the plugin on github?
[21:10:25] <aqeel> let me see..
[21:10:54] <coldhead> if it is you should fork the project and fix it in your fork, then you can submit it as a pull request to the original
[21:11:01] <coldhead> AND TAKE ALL THE GLORY AND FAME
[21:11:10] <grafi> _ALL_
[21:11:11] <grafi> ^^
[21:11:18] <aqeel> https://sites.google.com/site/danielgidmanresume/history/jquery-aautoscroll
[21:11:29] <coldhead> ergh
[21:11:31] <aqeel> it is not on github but used to be on jquery plugin
[21:11:45] <s34n> What is the return value of .remove()?
[21:12:35] <coldhead> aqeel: you could upload your version to github yourself then when you're done
[21:12:37] <coldhead> it's GPL3
[21:12:39] <coldhead> so that's kegit
[21:12:43] <coldhead> legit*
[21:13:10] <aqeel> i will for ssure..
[21:13:23] <aqeel> but i need to add few more gizmos though
[21:13:38] <coldhead> take your time
[21:13:54] <coldhead> i'm just saying if you do good work you should share it
[21:14:03] <coldhead> MUCH AS I HAVE SHARED MY GLORIOUS KALEIDOSCOPE
[21:14:27] <coldhead> http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[21:14:29] <coldhead> FEEL THE GLORY
[21:14:31] <aqeel> sure i will, i like sharing
[21:16:01] <aqeel> coldhead: cool
[21:18:57] <grafi> nice plaything you got there coldhead :P
[21:19:42] <coldhead> it eases the pain
[21:20:44] <grafi> pain of reality? ^^
[21:21:12] <coldhead> amongst other things
[21:21:25] <grafi> i just imagined how you just sit there hours and hours in front of your screen moving the mouse and staring into the abyss
[21:21:26] <grafi> ^^
[21:22:06] <coldhead> yes exactly
[21:22:10] <coldhead> you really understand
[21:22:12] <coldhead> thank you

[21:56:21] <jquery_help_me_m> Hey guys, any of  you got a sec to spare to take a looksie at my stack overflow post? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13873421/appending-dataset-results-to-a-div-with-specific-requirements
[21:59:06] <crab> what do you expect «var imagetag = $('<img src=" ');» to do?
[21:59:13] <jquery_help_me_m> i just edited it
[21:59:21] <jquery_help_me_m> i a code tag
[21:59:36] <jquery_help_me_m> refresh should show you
[22:02:49] <coldhead> i love when people have "help_me" in their nick so we know to help them
[22:02:57] <coldhead> otherwise they'd be ignored obviously
[22:03:05] <crab> or misled
[22:03:15] <coldhead> i would never do that
[22:03:32] <jquery_help_me_m> I would hope not :(
[22:03:49] <grafi> i think it would help more if it was HELP_ME instead of help_me
[22:03:53] <grafi> :p
[22:04:16] <jquery_help_me_m> H31P M3!!1!1 even
[22:05:06] <crab> i'm trying, but you didn't answer my question.
[22:05:24] <jquery_help_me_m> if you refresh you can see the edit
[22:05:26] <jquery_help_me_m> otherwise
[22:05:31] <jquery_help_me_m> <a href="C:/images/full/001.jpg" rel="external"><img src="C:/images/thumb/001.jpg" alt="Image 001" /></a>
[22:06:54] <coldhead> this doesn't do what you think it does var imagetag = $('<img src=" ');
[22:07:11] <coldhead> jQuery will do "oh he/she must mean '<img src="">'
[22:07:15] <coldhead> and it will close it for you
[22:07:30] <coldhead> if you want to work with html fragments keep them away from jQuery until they're well formed
[22:07:35] <coldhead> and THEN drop it in the magic $()
[22:07:56] <s34n> In a split listview, is there a way to switch the columns?
[22:08:28] <s34n> that is, make the left be the small column with the icon, and the right be the main listview item?
[22:08:30] <jquery_help_me_m> Hmm, is there a quick way to accomplish my end goal other than the method I'm trying?
[22:08:48] <coldhead> crab will know the answer to that shortly
[22:09:15] <jquery_help_me_m> This seems like a large community, lots of regulars here?
[22:09:27] <coldhead> hundreds
[22:09:32] <crab> well, it's just my first day here.

[22:16:14] <crab> maybe you should paste an example of the content you're trying to extract things from, because your code is just not right.

[22:17:29] <grafi> perpetual motion squad?
[22:18:32] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: the <a> tags you included in your answer to crab are note valid html
[22:18:33] <jquery_help_me_m> http://pastebin.com/nnvdKgqV by request is the XML that the image is being extracted from
[22:19:05] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: also, your jquery selector will not select them even if they were valid
[22:19:34] <jquery_help_me_m> To load Photoswipe from http://www.photoswipe.com/ the instructions say to use rel="external" with the <a> tags
[22:24:36] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: I'm trying to understand what you are trying to do. Here's what I've figured out so far:
[22:25:19] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: you use a POST request to retrieve an xml document that includes the addresses of some images
[22:25:59] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: you want to extract those addresses from the xml document and somehow use them with PhotoSwipe
[22:26:17] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: Have I got that right?
[22:26:23] <jquery_help_me_m> correct, the request has an 'imageid' that it passes over, which grabs the paths for the associated images which I'd like to load into a format in which photoswipe can undertstand yes
[22:26:28] <jquery_help_me_m> understand*
[22:27:36] <crab> the extracting part is ok, but this just isn't going to do what you want: var imagetag = $('<img src=" '); ... $(image).appendTo(imagetag);
[22:27:47] <jquery_help_me_m> I currently have in place a similar function that grabs other items from a database and sticks them into a listview, so I kind of just frankensteined that.
[22:28:24] <crab> better do something like var i = '<img src="' + ... + '</img>' and then $('#gallery2').append(i)
[22:28:32] <jquery_help_me_m> That's why I'm here because I kinda messed around enough to get that similar function to work, but I can't seem to get this to do what I want. there's got to be an easier way?
[22:28:58] <crab> well, i guess you'll have to wrap that in an <a>, but do all that in the string
[22:29:50] <jquery_help_me_m> When you say do that all in the string you mean just add it before the img tag?

[22:30:29] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: what you really might want to think about is some templating
[22:30:58] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: I think you want to take your xml and transform it into an html page
[22:31:06] <coldhead> i'm thinking about templating right now and it feels pretty good
[22:31:12] <jquery_help_me_m> No s34n I don't need to do that.
[22:31:13] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: XSLT is great for that
[22:31:28] <jquery_help_me_m> Just using the webservice to grab bits of information with different parameters
[22:31:52] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: or you could have your webservice return JSON and use one of the very many js templating engines

[22:32:32] <jquery_help_me_m> would posting the webservice code help?
[22:33:00] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: what you pasted was not JSON. It is XML

[22:33:17] <crab> jquery_help_me_m: even if you don't do all that, yes, build up a string with the html you want to see: '<a href="/whatever'+blah+'" rel=external><img src="/other'+blah+'"></a>' etc.
[22:34:19] <jquery_help_me_m> yeah s34n you're right i started using json when i was doing using an rss feed as a source but have since changed that around, mainly because I couldn't really get json to work
[22:34:49] <jquery_help_me_m> alright crab thanks for the help I'm gonna go test a few things out and I'll pop back if i need anything else
[22:34:57] <jquery_help_me_m> ill stay on here in the meantime
[22:34:58] <coldhead> sheer vulcanism
[22:34:58] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: huh? RSS is not JSON
[22:35:43] <jquery_help_me_m> s34n i've been on the computer for 18 hours and had 2 pots of coffee today while working on this sorry i'm not in my right mind and still don't have the technical understanding of the language that i wish i did
[22:35:49] <pandu101> coldhead: here is full code --> http://pastebin.com/1LAHW3WQ
[22:36:01] <jquery_help_me_m> thanks though! ill be back later
[22:36:33] <harami> hello, is there any way to check if a wordpress custom field exists through jquery and ajax
[22:39:38] <jquery_help_me_m> hey crab
[22:39:43] <jquery_help_me_m> I love you
[22:41:19] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/XbKLk/
[22:41:27] <aqeel> how good is this to scroll to top
[22:42:50] <jtm> For this: https://github.com/kflorence/jquery-deserialize/  The options -> change function. I see in the code it says: complete = jQuery.isFunction( options.complete ) ? options.complete : complete;  How does it know if it is a complete function?
[22:43:29] <coldhead> this looks okay to me, pandu101
[22:43:40] <coldhead> do you have a live demo or can you create one on jsfiddle?
[22:43:47] <coldhead> you might find you bug in the process!
[22:44:44] <jtm> It looks like I just pass it in as my 3rd argument as a function, but how does it know it's a complete function? I don't really get it.
[22:44:54] <jtm> Unless I create an object...?
[22:45:04] <pandu101> coldhead: live demo is at http://ezex-bongu.rhcloud.com/
[22:45:14] <pandu101> i think i'll do some debugging to see whats happening
[22:45:20] <pandu101> thanks coldhead
[22:46:24] <jtm> Think I figured it out
[22:46:34] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: http://pastebin.com/WxbSXyWM
[22:47:46] <jquery_help_me_m> s34n gimme a sec I'll try your way and see what happens
[22:47:57] <coldhead> pandu101: i don't think $(this) refers to what you think it refers to in textdisplay()
[22:48:50] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: sorry. http://pastebin.com/hzAgLRn5
[22:49:04] <pandu101> coldhead: hhmm... yeah i think you are right... but can i refer to the textbox explicitly by naming it?
[22:49:28] <pandu101> lemme try it
[22:49:41] <coldhead> that's what i'd try
[22:49:57] <coldhead> look at the docs for using a function with val()
[22:50:12] <coldhead> it provides val(elem, val) i think
[22:50:22] <coldhead> and you're supposed to return the new value
[22:50:42] <jessica_> though this is not a php chat but can i ask a very simple and small question
[22:51:49] <pandu101> coldhead: okay just tried refering to the textbox explicitly n that did not work. i'll check out the docs
[22:51:51] <jquery_help_me_m> s34n what is path/to/photo/listing suoosed to be in my code?
[22:52:05] <coldhead> worth a shot jessica_
[22:52:16] <jessica_> mysql_connect("localhost", "phonebook", "") or die("Connection Failed");
[22:52:25] <jessica_> i have a db called phonebook
[22:52:32] <jessica_> is my php sounding ok ?
[22:52:55] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: that is the call to your webservice to get the xml with the list of images
[22:54:03] <jquery_help_me_m> Oh okay so I should just stick the URL in there then>/
[22:54:20] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: I made it a GET rather than a POST because that is more RESTy without any more context for the call.
[22:54:31] <jessica_> here is my php code - http://pastebin.com/ecAx6TWu   , i have a db named- phonebook and a table named phonebook
[22:54:35] <jessica_> is this ok >
[22:54:46] <jessica_> coldhead, please advise
[22:55:12] <coldhead> no jessica_, it should be mysql_connect('server', 'username', 'password')
[22:55:32] <coldhead> then you select the actual database ON that server in SQL, with use phonebook;
[22:55:34] <jquery_help_me_m> if it helps you help me s34n here is the initial call to the webservice
[22:55:34] <jquery_help_me_m> http://pastebin.com/EzQ6c8su
[22:55:40] <coldhead> but you definitely want to take it to ##php
[22:55:48] <coldhead> those guys love mysql_connect stuff
[22:56:00] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/XbKLk/1/
[22:56:11] <aqeel> am i on right path??
[22:56:24] <jessica_> kk
[22:56:42] <pandu101> coldhead: the problem was the way i was defining the inside function. thanks for your help. :)
[22:57:16] <coldhead> http://dumpfm.s3.amazonaws.com/images/20100318/1268895690711-dumpfm-coldhead-cursor-disco.gif
[22:57:21] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: I don't know why you POST it, but it makes little difference to you jquery code
[22:57:26] <coldhead> happy hacking pandu101
[22:58:18] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: the actual host is the same origin as the current page, right?
[22:58:29] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: so you can leave off the hostname
[22:58:43] <jquery_help_me_m> nope
[22:58:49] <jquery_help_me_m> it's hosted on a different server
[22:59:09] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: are you familiar with same origin restrictions?
[22:59:21] <jquery_help_me_m> I've changed the respective settings to allow things
[22:59:37] <jquery_help_me_m> My other calls to webservices on the same server work perfectly with the same methods.
[22:59:47] <s34n> k
[23:01:59] <coldhead> DRAMA LLAMA
[23:02:03] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: http://pastebin.com/HnbQ8SgR
[23:05:36] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[23:05:36] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus’ hangin’ ’n’ chillin’
[23:05:41] <coldhead> cool
[23:05:47] <jquery_help_me_m> that gets me pretty damn close s34n i think i can handle it from there actually. The one that crab had provided worked, but PhotoSlider didn't like it for some reason
[23:07:01] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: oh. sorry. I missed crab's suggestion. Let me go look
[23:10:41] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: crab's suggestion is the same as mine, only crab included the rel="external" on the link, which is probably good
[23:10:47] <jquery_help_me_m> Well now all I have to do is tell PhotoSlider to initiate after that event has fired instaed of on document.ready
[23:11:48] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: are you familiar with engines like Mustache or Dust.js?
[23:12:53] <jquery_help_me_m> I am not, what are they all about? p.s. PhotoSlider actually just worked with document.ready so my night has been fruitful. But I'm trying to learn anything/everything would they be beneficial to me?
[23:13:18] <coldhead> polvo
[23:13:43] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: those are templating engines to accomplish exactly what you are doing
[23:13:55] <s34n> jquery_help_me_m: except the work with JSON
[23:14:18] <coldhead> yeah template engines are nice because they let you separate your HTML and your JS, so you don't have to do gross "<foo bar=\"aids\"> in your JS
[23:15:37] <s34n> ?nopm
[23:15:37] <bot-t> Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[23:15:40] <s34n> jessica_: ^^^^
[23:16:07] <coldhead> DAMN IT JESSICA_ GO ANNOY ##PHP AND ##MYSQL WITH YOUR PROBLEMS
[23:16:10] <coldhead> the will care
[23:16:12] <s34n> jessica_: if you need php help, you might check out a php channel
[23:16:18] <coldhead> they*
[23:16:36] <jessica_> no 1 was replyin, but i just got 1 now :)
[23:17:00] <coldhead> this is #jQuery not #jQuery_or_anything_else_if_the_other_channels_are_dea
[23:17:01] <coldhead> d
[23:17:21] <s34n> jessica_: my php help would go something like this: don't use php
[23:17:29] <coldhead> hahaha
[23:17:49] <grafi> and what should I use instead? ^^
[23:17:50] <jquery_help_me_m> s34n im looking into it now i appreciate all the help
[23:17:53] <jquery_help_me_m> im going to bed now
[23:18:05] <jquery_help_me_m> ill be back
[23:18:57] <s34n> grafi: node.js? :-)
[23:19:21] <grafi> is that really an alternative to the normal php stuff?
[23:19:30] <s34n> grafi: seems appropriate for a channel re: javascript tools
[23:19:59] <grafi> jsut because its there doesnt neccessarily means its the best tool for the job ^^
[23:20:27] <s34n> grafi: was that a comment about php?
[23:20:29] <coldhead> node has the major virtue of not being PHP
[23:20:55] <grafi> but thats like not using java because its java
[23:21:17] <coldhead> the main thing for me is that PHP's create_function() returns A STRING
[23:21:29] <coldhead> whereas a new function in node returns an actual function
[23:21:37] <coldhead> like in heaven
[23:21:46] <coldhead> except it works here now today
[23:21:54] <s34n> :)
[23:21:58] <grafi> i guess i have to take a peek at node ...
[23:22:01] <simius> thats the reson for not using php? =P
[23:22:10] <grafi> not really sure what it has to offer ^^
[23:22:22] <coldhead> it's an example of an overriding dedication to foolishness
[23:22:40] <coldhead> node is very fine if you adore js and want to do it all day everyday everywhere
[23:22:49] <coldhead> (weirdo)
[23:22:53] <grafi> yeah well
[23:22:59] <coldhead> it works well enough, you can use it "in production"
[23:25:53] <s34n> grafi: while you are peeking at node, you could peek at python or scala or ruby or perl or java or c or...
[23:26:07] <grafi> :p
[23:26:52] <coldhead> or coffeescript or typescript or roy or lispscript
[23:26:56] <grafi> making websites in python always seemed somewhat artificial to me
[23:27:15] <coldhead> what does that even mean?
[23:27:30] <coldhead> it's all made by artifice
[23:27:45] <coldhead> there is no free range organic HTML that is hand cured by russian peasants
[23:28:15] <grafi> its like forcing a square through a circle but thats just my very uneducated opinion :p
[23:28:38] <coldhead> which language is your favourite in general, grafi
[23:29:07] <grafi> i mostly use javascript
[23:29:16] <coldhead> respect
[23:29:23] <grafi> but not neccessarily because its my favorite
[23:29:35] <grafi> just because the projects i do require javascript
[23:29:36] <grafi> :P
[23:31:00] <s34n> grafi: ever do any backend work? or all html coding?
[23:32:22] <grafi> html "coding" :o
[23:32:56] <grafi> some backend work, yes nothing big though
[23:33:34] <coldhead> it's all just string concatenation
[23:36:36] <coldhead> bot-t: tell jessica_ i will never forget you
[23:36:36] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[23:37:15] <pixolin> Hello. My client wants "a map with circles that pop up an indicate our service range". Now I have an image with the map sliced in several parts and added some .hover() function to toggle the visibility of the ranges.
[23:37:52] <noregret> I have a var that contains a json string, how can i format it so it can look 'good' when displayed ?
[23:38:15] <noregret> by good, I mean the same output as (http://jsbeautifier.org/)
[23:38:16] <pixolin> however, the images with the ranges are bigger than the slices which I hover over. Now, if I leave the slice (but still am over the larger image) it doesn't toggle. any way to get around that?
[23:39:12] <simius> can use a browser plugin that formates it for you, noregret
[23:41:21] <coldhead> pixolin: have you got a link for that? it's very hard to visualise
[23:41:30] <noregret> simius: is there a jquery plugin for that ?
[23:41:56] <UltraMC> How to check if element has class with if statement?
[23:42:04] <coldhead> noregret: google for json pretty printer
[23:42:08] <coldhead> there are lots
[23:42:09] <s34n> pixolin: have you looked into gis solutions?
[23:42:28] <coldhead> UltraMC: if ($(this).is('.someclass'))
[23:42:31] <coldhead> ?is @ UltraMC
[23:42:31] <bot-t> UltraMC, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[23:43:12] <UltraMC> coldhead, thx
[23:43:24] <s34n> pixolin: your service sounds like something tower-based
[23:44:09] <simius> noregret, dont know, sorry. You want to display the actual json on a site?
[23:46:52] <pixolin> s34n: sorry, had to leave the computer for a moment. I know it's rather hard to follow (and describe) but also I don't know how to show that with images in jsfiddle.
[23:47:07] <pixolin> what do you mean by "tower based", s34n ?
[23:49:43] <s34n> pixolin: you want a gis solution
[23:50:01] <pixolin> sorry, never heard of that. can you give me a hint?
[23:50:35] <s34n> pixolin: http://mapserver.org/
[23:51:21] <s34n> pixolin: displays map in browser and lets you interact with it
[23:52:13] <s34n> pixolin: zoom in for more detail. turn layers on or off. click on objects to get more info. etc.
[23:53:10] <s34n> pixolin: google's map api can do a lot of that, too
[23:53:11] <pixolin> s34n: no, thank you, I have a jpeg image with that map and that will do perfectly. the point is more that if I hover over a div.outerbox and show a div.innerbox which is larger than the div.outerbox the .hover() function doesn't toggle the display when leaving div.outerbox.
[23:53:53] <pixolin> I think I'll try and make some jsfiddle to explain better. sorry for the confusion.
[23:54:32] <Cork> pixolin: so use mouseover to show it and mouseover on the document to hide it
[23:54:57] <s34n> pixolin: just as a gallery comment, hover doesn't work so well on many modern devices
[23:54:57] <pixolin> that's basically the same as using .hover(), isn't it?
[23:55:02] <Cork> no
[23:55:12] <Cork> hover uses mouseover and mouseout
[23:56:12] <pixolin> hm, it seems I don't quite get the part "mouseover on the document"
[23:56:43] <Cork> hmm wait a min why wouldn't you get hover called when you leave if its larger?
[23:56:44] <pixolin> anyway, before I confuse anybody even more, I'll try to set up a jsfiddle
[23:58:00] <UltraMC> How to hook up click event to element that has appeared in DOM? http://www.multiplayerminecraft.pl/test/
[23:58:32] <Cork> UltraMC: use delegated event listeners
[23:58:43] <Cork> see ?.delegate or see ?.on
[23:58:43] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[23:58:44] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:59:11] <UltraMC> Cork, any difference in those 2?
[23:59:26] <Cork> the order of the arguments
[23:59:31] <Cork> but no not really
[23:59:38] <Cork> just make sure you use the delegated syntax for on
[23:59:53] <Cork> (on handles both bind, and delegate)
