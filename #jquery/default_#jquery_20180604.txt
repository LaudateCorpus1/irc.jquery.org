[01:43:28] <chemik3> hello
[01:43:43] <chemik3> anybody here ?
[01:47:32] <chemik3> I'm not javascript developer, i using different programing language, but i need help
[01:47:46] <ryan_ford> just post the question
[01:47:52] <ryan_ford> someone will answer it when they see it
[01:48:51] <chemik3> i want to know algorithm how is calculated url variable searchValue=VlZW from string "VVV" on page:
[01:49:07] <chemik3> https://www.mojedatovaschranka.cz/sds/searchList.do?start=null&extendedSearch=no&searchCriterium=ovm_name_of_subject&searchValue=VlZW
[01:49:33] <chemik3> i need that algorithm rewrite to abap
[01:49:47] <ryan_ford> doesn't sound like a jQuery question
[01:50:05] <chemik3> i was tryed debug javascript but without luck
[01:50:51] <Cork> chemik3: souds lke they encrypt the search data
[01:51:34] <chemik3> Cork: it is possible find in source code algorithm?
[01:51:54] <chemik3> it is encrypted in javascript ?
[01:51:56] <Cork> should be somewhere in the webpage
[01:52:01] <Cork> yes, nothing else can do it
[01:54:01] <Woet> chemik3: did you ask them for permission to scrape their website?
[01:54:15] <chemik3> i put breakpoint on click event, but during debuging i did't find the place where encrypting is
[01:54:20] <Cork> chemik3: ah, no the encryption (or what it is) happens server side
[01:54:25] <Cork> its just a normal form
[01:55:01] <chemik3> i have task open that url from our information system
[01:55:08] <chemik3> so i need build that url
[01:55:17] <Cork> you most likely can't build it
[01:55:33] <chemik3> how this work? I dont get it
[01:55:45] <Cork> its submits the form and the server sends back a new url
[01:56:04] <Woet> chemik3: so send a POST to their form like their site does.
[01:56:14] * Cork nods
[01:56:57] <chemik3> can you told me where i can put breakpoint to see which data are send via post?
[01:57:06] <Woet> chemik3: just check the network tab.
[01:57:14] <Cork> it isn't done in javascript
[01:57:28] <Cork> so just open the network tab and enable persistent logging
[10:03:34] <preference> https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/
[10:04:30] <Cork> heh yup
[10:04:42] <Cork> been the talk all day ^^
[10:06:02] <preference> what do you think of it Cork ?
[10:06:05] <preference> sounds like cancer to me
[10:06:34] <Cork> there's always gitlab :P
[10:06:57] <Cork> joke a side, will see, if they make it big, clonky and slow like they usually do; there's always gitlab
[10:07:27] <preference> jokes aside :)
[10:07:40] <preference> it's not just the practical aspect. it's having microsoft be in charge of so many things
[10:07:53] <Cork> they aren't really incharge
[10:08:00] <Cork> they just control the hosting
[10:08:30] <preference> if microsoft didn't benefit from it, they wouldn't make the deal
[10:08:32] <Cork> and you shouldn't ever have code you rely on souly on one place (so if it goes down, just push it to a new host)
[10:08:40] <Cork> sure
[10:09:11] <preference> the benefit is having access to everything on it. cementing their position in CVs for this generation
[10:09:12] <Cork> doesn't inherently mean it is to the deprimand of the users though
[10:09:30] <preference> to be clear, my issue is not necessarily that microsoft will ruin the platform
[10:09:43] <preference> it's that microsoft owning something like this is bad for everyone that isn't microsoft because it stifles development elsewhere
[10:09:54] <Cork> except for private payed repos, everything there is public anyway
[10:10:05] <preference> this is what large corps do, they buy up smaller companies and then funnel money into them so that competitors can't get a hold of the market
[10:10:12] <Cork> so if they just wanted an index of what ppl has done, they would just have had to use a spider...
[10:10:50] <Cork> so, ya a little to much tinfoil for me (and i'm usually quite a bit of a tinfoler)
[10:10:59] <preference> i don't think i've said anything tinfoily
[10:11:08] <preference> this is just microsoft getting way too much power in a specific market
[10:11:32] <Cork> that microsoft would buy it to spy on all ppl of this generations sounds kinda tinfoily to me
[10:12:11] <preference> not spying
[10:12:18] <preference> i didn't mean that, brb
[10:14:28] <preference> Cork: i meant that this is microsoft forcing themselves to become even more of a fixture on developers' CVs
[10:14:41] <preference> people still say "must be proficient with microsoft word" today
[10:14:56] <Cork> i don't see them being a fixture at all actually
[10:15:05] <Cork> might be in other countries
[10:15:10] <preference> now showing off your developer samples will be on microsoft's platform
[10:15:21] <Cork> *optionally*
[10:15:26] <preference> ya, "optionally"
[10:15:49] <preference> "sorry, my skills are in openoffice, not microsoft word. is that ok?" "no, we use word" -- technically illiterate hiring managers
[10:16:22] <Cork> uh... unless you can't look and read in a menu those are one and the same
[10:16:43] <Cork> sure, if by knowing how to type in a word editor is to know "4th menu from the top under t"
[10:16:48] <Cork> then ya, they don't translate...
[10:19:06] <preference> Cork: but that's what it is like
[10:19:34] <Cork> only in companies that requires a degree for everything you're ever going to do
[10:19:47] <preference> microsoft are doing this to keep their foot in the market, and then they'll implement it with their other software and it will all become propietary
[10:19:52] <preference> that's not a good thing
[10:20:03] <Cork> preference: ok, enough of the tinfoly...
[10:20:24] <preference> that isn't tinfoil. why do you think microsoft are acquiring github? for charity?
[10:21:22] <Cork> preference: i know that it has been the mantra for the last close to 30 years that everything microsoft does is to be evil, but it is starting to be VERY old...
[10:22:26] <Cork> it is one thing when a platform is locking user in, but this is a completely open platform, you can migrate where ever you want with two command lines
[10:22:26] <preference> i don't believe microsoft is evil
[10:22:31] <Cork> so just drop it...
[10:22:47] <preference> they did terribly unethical things a long time ago, but that's not evil
[10:22:56] <Cork> well the agitation of the bad for everyone as soon as they take something over states something else
[10:23:17] <preference> ok, so tell me what you think microsoft are acquiring github for
[10:24:27] <Cork> they are positioning them self to be a core feature for software development; they have been basically since asure became the core of microsoft
[10:24:35] <Cork> and this is just another step in that
[10:24:51] <Cork> just like visual studio code, or they taking over mono or...
[10:24:54] <Cork> (the list is long)
[10:27:12] <preference> that's what i'm saying...
[10:27:32] <preference> they're trying to make themselves the centre of development when they shouldn't be
[10:27:47] <Cork> no, the are not trying to make them self the center
[10:27:50] <Cork> there is a difference
[10:31:58] <preference> ok
[11:06:02] <isemenov> good evening!
[11:06:22] <isemenov> is it possible to disable jquery mask timers when there are no masked inputs on a page?
[11:06:47] <isemenov> I'm working on a project where the jquery numberMask.js and mask.js files are loaded by default for every page
[11:07:25] <isemenov> this in itself I guess is not perfect, but I'm not going to look for a way to change this because it comes form the php framework
[11:07:33] <isemenov> *from the
[11:08:11] <isemenov> thus, the question is: how do I disable the timers (setInterval) that jquery mask installs on the page? I'm sure there are no inputs, even hidden, that have a mask on
[11:08:14] <isemenov> thank you
[11:08:16] <isemenov> !
[11:10:39] <Cork> isemenov: that isn't in jquery but in a plugin
[11:10:47] <Cork> check the plugins config settings (if it has any)
[11:11:49] <Cork> but most likely you will have to fork the plugin
[11:17:55] <isemenov> Cork: do I understand correctly that a better solution is not to load the corresponding .js on the pages that don't need it?
[11:42:56] <nsiano> isemenov, that would probably be the easiest solution
[13:20:43] <DobreJoe> Hello, I’m struggling with window.history.pushState(). How can I add an entry to my browser’s history so when a user clicks on the back button it will be returned to my index page /
[15:23:09] <noahsiano> DobreJoe, if you do a pushState() of your index page, it will not redirect to the index page, but once they leave, clicking the back button will take you back to the index page.
[15:23:12] <noahsiano> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Example_of_pushState()_method
[16:40:13] <sine0> I have 2 files, a regular .js lib and a .min.js lib. they are the same version and yet one works and one does not.
[16:40:51] <sine0> is this normal or should there be no issues with minified version. this is a github project owl.carousel
[16:46:28] <robertmaxrees> sine0 any console errors?
[16:47:14] <robertmaxrees> because generally there should be no functional difference.
[16:49:21] <sine0> robertmaxrees: owl.carousel.js owl.carousel.min.js; the .min works and the regular does not. both downloaded from github zip
[16:49:45] <sine0> I am switching over the local urls in my html and i just cant work it out lol
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> are there any errors or anything with the non-minified?
[16:50:05] <robertmaxrees> also: link?
[16:53:23] <sine0> robertmaxrees: no console errors in browser. and i dont have a jSfiddle I have not got around to setting one up
[17:24:36] <robertmaxrees> sine0 sorry, just saw this.
[17:24:43] <robertmaxrees> you aren't, like, pulling from master or something, right?
[17:28:26] <Ninjacoder> robertmaxrees, hi
[17:28:35] <Ninjacoder> u know how to solve this ? https://jsfiddle.net/_ninjacoder_/as3bwyrd/32/
[17:28:41] <Ninjacoder> im a bit stuck
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:29:19] <robertmaxrees> 2 things:
[17:29:26] <robertmaxrees> 1: your fiddle isn't setup riught.
[17:29:28] <robertmaxrees> 2: what's the issue?>
[17:30:38] <sine0> robertmaxrees: im new to github, although i heard the party is just starting to end today... however which one should i get ? develope or master ?
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:30:55] <robertmaxrees> it's not "starting to end"
[17:30:59] <robertmaxrees> and you want neither of those.
[17:31:04] <robertmaxrees> link to the repo.
[17:31:39] <sine0> https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2

[17:32:48] <robertmaxrees> click this button.
[17:33:31] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder ?
[17:34:28] <Ninjacoder> im here
[17:34:31] <Ninjacoder> reading
[17:35:31] <Ninjacoder> owl carrousel is for me ?
[17:35:41] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder no
[17:35:48] <Ninjacoder> my issue is i cant parse the xml data from a url API
[17:35:53] <Ninjacoder> ok. thats is
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: your fiddle isn't setup right.
[17:36:04] <Ninjacoder> i know that this is my issue
[17:36:20] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[17:36:25] <Ninjacoder> ok.
[17:36:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't do html/body/head tags in jsfiddle.
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/as3bwyrd/41/
[17:36:49] <robertmaxrees> so start with this.
[17:36:52] <robertmaxrees> now look at your console
[17:37:26] <Ninjacoder> i'll indent and all that stuff. but is the get script im stuck
[17:37:41] <Ninjacoder> "}" expecting somewhere
[17:37:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:37:49] <robertmaxrees> your js isn't val;id.
[17:37:54] <robertmaxrees> *valid
[17:38:05] <Ninjacoder> isnt isnt, i know. xD
[17:38:15] <robertmaxrees> so look at parts where it might be broken.
[17:38:28] <Ninjacoder> ok tell me.
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> try deleting the commented out code for starters.
[17:38:48] <robertmaxrees> and then hit "tidy" in jsfiddle.
[17:38:50] <Ninjacoder> done.
[17:38:51] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty obvious.
[17:39:14] <sine0> robertmaxrees: thanks that fixed it....
[17:39:15] <Ninjacoder> tidyed
[17:39:27] <Ninjacoder> now?
[17:39:28] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder see the error?
[17:39:41] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/B3ZJjB4.png
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't see anything wrong here?
[17:39:51] <robertmaxrees> sine0 rad.
[17:40:04] <robertmaxrees> sine0 rarely do you want to pull from a non-release tag in GH.
[17:40:10] <Ninjacoder> i see the line but dont know
[17:40:25] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder where's "table" defined"?
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> also: you have a } and a }); at the end of the file - do you need either of those?
[17:40:49] <Ninjacoder> in html
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder erm.
[17:41:02] <Ninjacoder> nope
[17:41:04] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder there is no variable called "table"
[17:41:07] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[17:41:10] <robertmaxrees> clean those things up.
[17:41:15] <Ninjacoder> 1sec.
[17:41:27] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - those extra closing brackets aren't just "unnecessary", they're invalid.
[17:43:50] <Ninjacoder> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/_ninjacoder_/as3bwyrd/47/
[17:44:30] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> so now open your dev tools.\
[17:44:43] <Ninjacoder> dev tools ?
[17:44:44] <robertmaxrees> guessing it's the buytton that's not doing what you want?
[17:44:53] <Ninjacoder> the sublime text ?
[17:44:54] <robertmaxrees> the ones in your browser?
[17:44:57] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> you on windows?
[17:45:06] <Ninjacoder> i've chrome
[17:45:10] <Ninjacoder> yep
[17:45:16] <robertmaxrees> go to jsfiddle
[17:45:19] <robertmaxrees> and hit f12 on your keyboard.
[17:45:22] <Ninjacoder> but i think is not the button
[17:45:29] <Ninjacoder> ok im in console
[17:45:38] <robertmaxrees> now press the button
[17:45:43] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:45:50] <robertmaxrees> sure looks like that's throwing an error to me.
[17:45:55] <Ninjacoder> loadDoc is not defined
[17:45:55] <Ninjacoder>     at HTMLButtonElement.onclick
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:46:12] <Ninjacoder> is not clean source
[17:46:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw onclick="loadDoc()" don't use onclick
[17:46:21] <robertmaxrees> use js event bindings./
[17:46:43] <Ninjacoder> ern.. i'll try
[17:47:02] <robertmaxrees> but
[17:47:04] <robertmaxrees> i'ma do you a favor.
[17:47:17] <robertmaxrees> kill the onclick out of the button
[17:47:24] <robertmaxrees> and add in a class="loadDocButton"
[17:47:42] <robertmaxrees> then stick a $('.loadDocButton').on('click', loadDoc); after the loadDock definition in the js pane
[17:48:28] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't normally do freebies like this but in this case i'm gonna shortcut you to the real problem.
[17:49:08] <Ninjacoder> im deeply gratefull
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> don't be grateful.
[17:49:30] <robertmaxrees> you're gonna be mad in a sec ;)
[17:50:01] <Ninjacoder> why, lol
[17:50:08] <robertmaxrees> you make those changes?
[17:50:50] <Ninjacoder> noo i neeed more time for this event
[17:50:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/as3bwyrd/51/
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> freebie
[17:50:57] <Ninjacoder> and need to read how to add the class
[17:51:02] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:51:19] <Ninjacoder> <3
[17:51:20] <robertmaxrees> open the fiddle i just linked, open your dev tools, and press your button
[17:51:26] <robertmaxrees> should see a console error.
[17:51:52] <Ninjacoder> yes it is
[17:51:58] <robertmaxrees> so what's that error say?
[17:52:15] <Ninjacoder> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https://fiddle.jshell.net' is therefore not allowed access.
[17:52:18] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:52:27] <robertmaxrees> so - this is part of something called CORS.
[17:52:40] <robertmaxrees> because that API doesn't allow CORS, you can't hit it via AJAX.
[17:52:52] <Ninjacoder> really ?
[17:52:55] <robertmaxrees> yep,.
[17:53:02] <Ninjacoder> adding ?&format=xml ?
[17:53:09] <robertmaxrees> try.
[17:53:12] <Ninjacoder> nooo
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:53:19] <Ninjacoder> i spend a few hours this this
[17:53:29] <robertmaxrees> you'd need a server-side proxy to handle those requests for you.
[17:53:39] <Ninjacoder> node.js works ?
[17:53:45] <Ninjacoder> node server ?
[17:53:47] <robertmaxrees> you could create a proxy using node, sure.,
[17:53:49] <Ninjacoder> dont understant
[17:53:58] <robertmaxrees> what don't you understand?
[17:54:01] <Ninjacoder> CORS
[17:54:07] <Ninjacoder> the music team
[17:54:15] <robertmaxrees> "the music team"???
[17:54:21] <Ninjacoder> sorry is ajoke
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> long story short.
[17:54:57] <robertmaxrees> you know how you can stay logged into your email even if you're not actually reading it?
[17:55:07] <robertmaxrees> like, you can be browsing other pages but still be logged in, right?
[17:55:46] <Ninjacoder> hmm
[17:55:54] <robertmaxrees> follow so far?F
[17:56:00] <Ninjacoder> a lot of factors i thnk
[17:56:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:56:06] <robertmaxrees> dude it's simple.
[17:56:14] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the start of that tho?
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> so now - without CORS, I could make a webpage that could do an ajax request to mail.google.com or w/e email provider.
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> when that happens, it's done just like your browser were the one making the request.
[17:57:01] <robertmaxrees> basically like if you navigated there.
[17:57:07] <robertmaxrees> so i could read your email super easyu.
[17:57:12] <robertmaxrees> CORS prevents that.
[17:57:29] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:58:04] <Ninjacoder> wow, interesting
[18:02:17] <Ninjacoder> wb.
[18:16:22] <robertmaxrees> weee
[18:20:03] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder you figure your stuff out?
[18:26:42] <Ninjacoder> no
[18:27:03] <Ninjacoder> im assuming cors and thinking alternative for show the xml
[18:27:31] <Ninjacoder> that url is a web API from flick, i dont know that restriction , but is okey
[18:27:46] <Ninjacoder> robertmaxrees btw looking ur fiddles
[18:27:53] <Ninjacoder> ;)
[18:35:51] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder "im assuming curs and thinking alternative for show the xml" wat
[18:38:18] <Ninjacoder> robertmaxrees yes what do you suggest if i need to run that script , but not configuring a proxy
[18:38:53] <Ninjacoder> i did with json and it works only with tags i dont know why not with xml with the same url
[18:39:06] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder not folloiwn.
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> *following
[18:39:13] <robertmaxrees> links to examples?
[18:39:26] <Ninjacoder> ok a sec
[18:40:37] <Ninjacoder> https://jsfiddle.net/_ninjacoder_/bk8957ka/16/
[18:41:13] <robertmaxrees> so you're asking why https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?jsoncallback=?&format=json works?
[18:41:40] <Ninjacoder> ern nope
[18:41:49] <robertmaxrees> ????
[18:42:18] <Ninjacoder> im asking why https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/as3bwyrd/51/ this doesnt work
[18:42:37] <robertmaxrees> because that URL doesn't support CORS
[18:43:53] <Ninjacoder> and if i need to use that url what do u suggest ?
[18:44:13] <robertmaxrees> you have to use a server-side proxy.
[18:46:37] <Ninjacoder> robertmaxrees and with other api from flickr ?
[18:47:00] <robertmaxrees> you mean other APIs with the same error?
[18:47:11] <Ninjacoder> after that i need to select what lines from the xml data i want to show
[18:47:17] <Ninjacoder> no, lol
[18:47:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:47:34] <Ninjacoder> an api 'll work
[18:47:40] <robertmaxrees> you mean you need to display particular data from the JSON?
[18:47:52] <Ninjacoder> yes but not from JSON from XML
[18:48:06] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use the xml unless you use a server-side proxy/.
[18:48:23] <robertmaxrees> if you get that working, then make your proxy do that work for you.
[18:49:12] <Ninjacoder> pff.. i'll try but need to read for configure well and all.
[18:49:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:49:55] <Ninjacoder> i read proxy and i think Tor, and difficul to configure.
[18:49:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:50:02] <Ninjacoder> lol
[18:50:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to write a server that does the request for you.
[18:50:39] <Ninjacoder> ohh i forget a piece of source in that fiddle
[18:50:40] <robertmaxrees> your page requests the data from your server, your server requests that data from the flickr api, and then your server sends that to the page.

[18:55:38] <Ninjacoder> oad https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?&format=xml: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:8080' is therefore not allowed access.
[18:55:41] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:55:43] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:55:52] <robertmaxrees> because you need to write code that makes your server do it.
[18:55:55] <robertmaxrees> not your page./

[18:57:36] <robertmaxrees> your server has to make the request.
[18:57:39] <robertmaxrees> not the html page.
