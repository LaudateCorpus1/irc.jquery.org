[00:13:01] <evanesoteric> How different is Jquery 3 from version 1? If I change a template template to use 3x instead of 2x, will is likely break many things? Or are the 2 quite similar, just expanded upon... ?
[00:19:00] <Uhkis> evanesoteric: try and see, should be mostly compatible
[01:06:40] <futzhu> where to see documentation of xhrFields? some people know how to use this but i can't any documentation to this
[01:06:44] <evanesoteric> Seems to work alright thus far, thanks
[02:28:31] <undefined_bob> morning
[02:57:26] <nutzz_> Does enyone know how can I remove the dollar sign from the jquery-ui currency spinner?
[03:56:13] <fn> had to setup a landingpage with 20 carousels/sliders with between ~10-16 slides. every slide should open a lightbox with the carousel as a detail view.
[03:56:39] <fn> do I generate 20 carousel/sliders with jquery or is it better to render the html static?
[05:21:03] <Sircle> Whats wrong here? https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9032453
[05:38:56] <FilipNortic> Sircle: that's not jQuery
[05:40:19] <FilipNortic> but seems like you already moved to js channel instead
[05:45:05] <Sircle> FilipNortic,  I am trying to load <script src...> synchrounsoly. One after another. Whats the best way?
[05:45:34] <Cork> you would have to have then statically in the html
[05:45:44] <Cork> injected script tags are always async
[05:47:07] <FilipNortic> or getScript in a with callbacks
[05:47:16] <FilipNortic> but if on in the chain fail...
[05:47:17] <Cork> wouldn't make is sync though
[05:47:29] <Cork> only async with dependent load
[05:47:34] <Sircle> Cork, https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9032454
[05:48:02] <Cork> Sircle: that is the async dependent load solution ya
[05:48:18] <Cork> sync would mean code after the block would not execute before this is complete
[05:48:22] <Cork> and that is NOT the case
[05:49:29] <Sircle> How can I fix it
[05:49:41] <Cork> you would have to write it statically in the html like i said
[05:50:09] <FilipNortic> or be satisfied with a chain of callbacks?
[05:50:31] <Cork> ya
[05:50:43] <Sircle> Cork,  statically in html? How?
[05:50:44] <Cork> you would just have to put all code depending on this code in callbacks
[05:50:54] <Sircle> FilipNortic,  how exactly?
[05:50:56] <Cork> <script src=""></script><script src=""></script><script src=""></script><script src=""></script>
[05:51:09] <Sircle> Cork,  is that async or sync?
[05:51:16] <Cork> that would be sync
[05:51:18] <Sircle> Cork,  is async
[05:51:41] <Sircle> Cork,  I see in network tab that some script loads first and some later
[05:51:43] <Cork> <body><script src=""></script><script src=""></script><script src=""></script><script src=""></script> <script> when everything before is executed</script></body>
[05:51:56] <Cork> Sircle: load and execute is not the same thing
[05:52:08] <Cork> and if it has to hold the network access then you will have a hard time
[05:52:12] <Cork> cause browser optimize that
[05:52:15] <Sircle> Cork,  FilipNortic  I want to start loading the next script if the first is loaded
[05:52:21] <Sircle> FilipNortic,  ^
[05:52:30] <Cork> then you will have to do it async
[05:52:54] <Sircle> Ok.. I am just confused with way and syntax
[05:53:06] <Sircle> How exactly to do it
[05:53:14] <Cork> Sircle: if you through dom api inject a script into the page, it will execute async
[05:53:17] <Cork> no way around that
[05:53:32] <Sircle> But I  want to start loading the next script if the first is loaded
[05:53:37] <Cork> if you want it to block other scripts later in the page you have to have it statically, but LOADING of the content won't be sync; ever
[05:53:59] <Sircle> hm
[05:54:08] <Cork> so if contacting the server matters you will have to do it async with dependent callbacks
[05:54:18] <Cork> but then other script blocks later in the page can't depend on it
[05:54:18] <Sircle> ok
[05:54:43] <Cork> cause they can execute before the content is loaded (and most likely will)
[05:54:57] <Sircle> Ok, if I have about 10 scripts. I want script 1, 2, 3 in sequence and then any script can load
[05:55:05] <Sircle> In any sequence
[05:55:30] <Cork> then you woulud have to do load script 1. async, then 2, 3 and then in the last callback load all the other scripts async
[05:55:42] <Cork> so none of the scripts can be loaded through normal <script src=""> tags
[05:55:45] <Sircle> ok
[05:56:04] <Cork> though why you care what order the server gets request about the script tags makes no sense
[05:56:13] <Cork> that will just slowdown the loading of the page...
[05:56:24] <Cork> (and quite a bit too)
[05:56:27] <Sircle> Suppose I do that with JS or query, how to give that script to browser? Like <script> tags do
[05:56:40] <Cork> you can't
[05:56:51] <Cork> you would have to use something like $.getScript(url)
[05:56:53] <Sircle> Actually script 3 depends on things in 2 and 2 depends on 1
[05:57:07] <Cork> ya, you would have to handle the dependency order manyally
[05:57:10] <Cork> *manually
[05:58:10] <Sircle> Ok so the syntax will be Promise.resovle($.getScript(1)).then(function(){$.getScript(2)}) .then.. so on?
[05:58:50] <Cork> Promise.resovle($.getScript(1)).then(function(){$.getScript(2).then()}) ya
[05:59:15] <Sircle> And where to put last 7 scripts which I do not care but they might depend on the first 3
[05:59:23] <Cork> or you could just use $.getScript(1).done(function() { $.getScript(2).done(function() {}) })
[05:59:39] <Cork> then you can do them all in one go ay
[05:59:42] <Cork> *ya
[06:00:09] <Cork> but ya, it sounds like you're constructing something in a very overcomplicated way here
[06:03:19] <Sircle> hm
[06:03:53] <Sircle> Stoneage angular.js legacy app maintenance
[06:04:32] <Cork> and why does the server access order matters?
[06:07:36] <Sircle> Actually script 3 depends on things in 2 and 2 depends on 1
[06:11:01] <Sircle> Cork,  with this syntax, 2 and 3 load at the same time but after 1 is done
[06:13:06] <MaNa2k> Crossposting: Got problems with the jq progressbar https://jqueryui.com/progressbar/ ?  it works oki in chrome, but in explorer or edge, it wont animate. Anyone know what might be the problem ?
[06:13:22] <Sircle> FilipNortic, Cork  any clues?
[06:14:51] <FilipNortic> Sircle: clues about what cork gave you a working solution, atleast if you are using jQuery. If not why are you asking here
[06:15:43] <Sircle> I did Promise version with 'return' in each fund and it seems to be resolved
[06:17:29] <FilipNortic> you can really use return in callbacks... what are you trying accomplish with returns?
[06:21:59] <Sircle> FilipNortic,  Cork https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9032455
[06:24:43] <FilipNortic> I'm not knowlagable enough with non jQuery ajax to help you i'm afraid
[06:25:17] <Sircle> np. thx!
[07:18:38] <sine0> If I have a drop down select option, how can i .on('change' that ?
[07:18:51] <sine0> its a <select
[07:25:02] <sine0> I have tried this but its not triggering
[07:25:05] <sine0> $('#input_10').on('change', function(e) {
[07:26:07] <sine0> ok i fixed it
[08:25:21] <Neo1> hi
[08:25:28] <Neo1> who know how to send fax?
[08:25:54] <Cork> uhh and how is that related to jquery or even javascript?
[08:26:17] <Neo1> no how
[08:26:21] <Neo1> Cork: nohow
[08:26:29] <MikeD_> to send a fax:  1) go back to 1997 2) ask a secretary for help
[08:26:29] <Cork> Neo1: wrong channel then
[08:26:37] <Neo1> Cork: it's my the personal question
[08:26:42] <Cork> wrong channel
[08:27:09] <Neo1> Cork: and where ask? I got bank statement need send on fax to Amazon
[08:27:33] <Cork> ##amazone? i don't have a clue, and is one of the reason i said wrong channel
[08:27:47] <Cork> this channels topic is jquery not amazone fax
[08:28:13] <MikeD_> that you are asked to send a fax to amazon should be setting off red flags for you
[08:29:19] <Neo1> Cork: on channel amazon only I one...
[08:29:22] <MikeD_> turning up services with amazon should have have processes like "Leave your social security card and a stack of cash in an envelop behind an elm tree in the local park"
[08:29:23] <Neo1> ok will use google
[08:29:24] <Cork> ...
[08:29:48] <MikeD_> s/have have/NOT have
[08:30:04] <Neo1> MikeD_: bad understand what you say... maybe you have broken english)
[08:30:31] <Neo1> MikeD_: on Amazon stole 40$, I want return
[08:30:46] <Cork> Neo1: he is basically asking if your stopping random ppl on the street asking how to send fax with amazone too
[08:30:54] <Cork> cause that is basically what you're doing here...
[08:31:40] <Neo1> Cork: clearly, just he has wrong English. I nothing understood what he said
[08:31:49] <MikeD_> hmm... i was thinking that Amazon really doesn't want your fax, so someone scamming you with "send your bank statement"
[08:32:05] <Cork> Neo1: stop insulting ppl that is actually on topic for the channel
[08:32:16] <Cork> MikeD_: and i would recommend to just drop the subject
[08:32:17] <Neo1> MikeD_: account blocked I can't login there
[08:32:40] <Neo1> Cork: Truth now called insult?
[08:32:47] <Neo1> ))))
[08:32:53] <MikeD_> heh, yeah... i are have broken english, and like Forrest Gump, "that's all i'm gonna say 'bout that"  :p
[08:32:56] <Neo1> I'm joking)
[08:33:31] <Neo1> MikeD_: no, just you need use with me more simple phrases
[08:33:58] <Neo1> MikeD_: here not native and bad understand what you want. Try speak more understandable...
[08:34:01] <MikeD_> i will grant that we sometimes use words we think people know, and i'm ok with rephrasing for non-english-native speakers
[08:34:41] <MikeD_> have you tried ##help ?
[08:35:06] <Neo1> I will try google, 'how send to fax' or watch video on youtube
[08:35:26] <Cork> good, not drop the topic or take it else where
[08:59:43] <undefined_bob> lol
[09:32:56] <carmack> Hi! I seeking event. After append() do something
[09:33:13] <carmack> Such event exist?
[09:38:13] <Deusdeorum> suppose i have a lot of classes which i need to empty on text, how can i empty them on text without doing $('.class1').text(''); for all of them?
[09:41:38] <carmack> Deusdeorum: you get all elements from parent class?
[09:41:49] <carmack> And want make it empty?
[09:42:07] <Deusdeorum> hmm, true, can go that way instead
[09:42:59] <carmack> parent.each( (indx, elem) => $(elem).text('') )
[09:43:01] <carmack> Like this
[09:43:10] <Deusdeorum> yes
[09:43:42] <sine0> this should update the input text box with the variable data right? $('#input_1_20').val(ImgName);
[10:00:27] <MikeD_> parent.children().text('')
[10:01:00] <MikeD_> admittedly, that does look a bit scary though
[10:02:26] <sine0> scary ?
[10:02:44] <sine0> oh not me
[10:05:07] <sine0> MikeD_: can you help me out. Im trying to update an input text with an id of #input_1_20
[10:05:29] <sine0> even if i hard code it with $('#input_1_20').val('test'); it does nto update
[10:06:00] <MikeD_> what kind of input is it?
[10:06:38] <sine0> <input name="input_20" id="input_1_20" type="text" value="" class="medium" tabindex="1" aria-invalid="false">
[10:08:07] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/byxf47o3/
[10:08:25] <MikeD_> so your real solution might have something else going on?
[10:10:22] <sine0> hmm im not sure
[10:15:18] <sine0> it works outside of hte document.ready function
[10:15:34] <sine0> i.e when the page loads.
[10:15:56] <sine0> but if i put it inside of another #ids on.('change
[10:18:55] <Rixon> anyone here use DataTables plugin?
[10:19:47] <MikeD_> sine0: can you make a jsfiddle example of what you're doing?
[10:20:00] <Rixon> I have a table that has a button and a modal div hidden inside the last cell on the row, if I replace that cell's contents with just a text node, $('#myTable').DataTable(); works fine with zero config, but if I leave the button and div in there, it fails
[10:20:17] <Rixon> i just get typeError: nTd is undefined
[10:20:44] <Rixon> everything I found in the forum is older than last syntax change in API
[10:22:23] <marcinusr_>  hello guys. Need help with jquery ui. Does anybody know how to use it in Symfony while using Webpack? i've installed this through yarn add jquery-ui but it doesn't work when i do var $ = require('jquery-ui');
[10:23:50] <Rixon> the substitution is what you replace match with
[10:23:53] <Rixon> oops wrong chan
[10:27:53] <sine0> MikeD_: it works in jsfiddle
[10:27:56] <sine0> https://jsfiddle.net/byxf47o3/1/
[10:32:08] <marcinusr_> Need help with jquery ui. Does anybody know how to use it in Symfony while using Webpack? i've installed this through yarn add jquery-ui but it doesn't work when i do var $ = require('jquery-ui');
[10:33:36] <taplar> marcinusr_: that is more related to your build library, not jQuery
[10:33:43] <taplar> you should try to find a room related to those
[10:48:25] <d3m0n> Could someone explain to me how I can make calls to a jquery's plugin? Specifically from http://scottcheng.github.io/cropit/#docs-apis
[10:48:42] <d3m0n> make api calls*
[10:49:20] <d3m0n> $imageCropper. being what? The element I select. I tried that one.
[10:53:01] <taplar> bunch of documentation above that link that shows the selection and initialization of the stuff
[12:37:14] <Neo1> what is bower?
[12:37:22] <Neo1> npm
[12:37:55] <Neo1> include JavaScript files via Bower, Composer, Meteor, or npm...
[12:38:03] <Neo1> this is internet stores?
[12:40:12] <Neo1> oh here exists ##bootstrap
[12:40:21] <Neo1> I going there
[12:54:48] <grapheti> Neo1, those are package managers. It allows you to download whatever package you want and include it in your project.
[12:55:18] <Neo1> they know from download?
[12:55:25] <Neo1> how they know?
[12:55:39] <grapheti> how do they know what?
[12:55:51] <grapheti> people write the packages
[12:56:44] <grapheti> This package was written by people - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery
[12:57:05] <grapheti> you just type: npm install jquery -save-dev and it downloads the package for you via npm
[12:57:26] <taplar> i feel like "people write the packages" is like a stoner thing to say
[12:57:36] <grapheti> haha
[12:58:13] <grapheti> it's actually: npm install jquery --save-dev
[12:58:58] <grapheti> Neo1, search on youtube for more of an idea - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYZh7OqD9Qo
[12:59:22] <grapheti> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s70-Vsud9Vk
[13:05:28] <Neo1> in that video guy each word so clearly pronounce I all understood
[13:05:53] <Neo1> that guy has  good pronounce I think
[13:08:05] <Neo1> possibly in javascript define multi dimensional array?
[13:08:17] <Neo1> I know how one dimensional
[13:08:20] <taplar> sure
[13:08:32] <Neo1> var mass=[0, 0, 0, 0];
[13:08:37] <taplar> an array can contain an array
[13:08:51] <Neo1> multiple tried many times and dropped
[13:09:00] <Neo1> how?
[13:09:10] <taplar> just stick an array in it
[13:09:17] <Neo1> with can not numbers
[13:09:22] <Neo1> i know this
[13:09:24] <taplar> a number isn't an array
[13:09:33] <Neo1> [[0,0,0], [1,1,1]]
[13:09:38] <taplar> there you go
[13:09:42] <Neo1> but I want key be not number
[13:09:53] <taplar> associative arrays are not a thing in js
[13:09:59] <taplar> you have objects and you have arrays
[13:10:28] <taplar> what exactly are you trying to make?
[13:10:33] <Neo1> taplar: when I returned result in $.ajax. I do echo json_encode($result); and in success function
[13:10:50] <Neo1> do msg=pars.JSON(msg); and got array
[13:10:55] <taplar> sure
[13:10:59] <Neo1> associative array,
[13:11:02] <taplar> no
[13:11:03] <taplar> object
[13:11:11] <taplar> there are no associative arrays in js
[13:11:24] <Neo1> but I do if(msg['error']==0) { do something}
[13:11:34] <taplar> msg is an object
[13:12:07] <Neo1> I did this console.log(msg); and this look like array
[13:12:13] <taplar> i don't care dude, lol
[13:12:15] <Neo1> in this brackets []
[13:12:24] <Neo1> and inside a few arrays
[13:12:26] <Neo1> ok
[13:12:32] <taplar> php has associative arrays.  arrays that can be accessed by key or index
[13:12:34] <taplar> js does not
[13:12:46] <Neo1> you said impossible define associative mass
[13:12:57] <Neo1> I recolled
[13:12:57] <taplar> i said js doesn't have associative arrays
[13:13:14] <Neo1> I can do if(msg.error==0) need to try this
[13:13:25] <Neo1> okay
[13:13:26] <taplar> var msg = { error: 0 }
[13:13:40] <Neo1> no, I don't need do this
[13:14:05] <Neo1> or need
[13:14:21] <taplar> an array can contain anything, be it a primative, object, or another array
[13:14:28] <taplar> object values can also be any of those three
[13:14:32] <Neo1> see I can do this {error:[0,0,0], data:[0,0,0]}
[13:14:37] <taplar> you can combine that to be whatever you need
[13:14:39] <taplar> sure
[13:14:50] <taplar> but that's not an associative array
[13:15:02] <taplar> that's an object, with keys that refer to arrays
[13:15:05] <Neo1> will behave like associative
[13:15:19] <taplar> behave like, sure.  is, no
[13:15:25] <Neo1> I understood, recalled it
[13:15:51] <Neo1> I have other thought
[13:16:09] <Neo1> how increase performance, I very slow do tasks
[13:16:30] <Neo1> very very long
[13:16:43] <taplar> i'm not sure what you are asking about, specifically
[13:17:01] <Neo1> no about performance and speed
[13:17:10] <taplar> that's a very broad quesiton
[13:17:12] <Neo1> I want create scripts faster
[13:17:57] <taplar> kinda OT for the room.  but you'd have to identify what parts you are slow on
[13:18:02] <Neo1> do you think need personally to analyze what consume much time?
[13:18:34] <taplar> you have to know what you are slow on, to know what you need to improve upon.
[13:18:56] <Neo1> I think this part, last project I was need to include select2, do you know select2?
[13:19:13] <taplar> not really
[13:19:15] <Neo1> taplar: I included this before in a few projects
[13:19:37] <Neo1> taplar: jQuery plugin for select https://select2.org/
[13:19:56] <taplar> i know of it.  i just don't know it very well
[13:20:00] <Neo1> taplar: it's make select with search, very useful think, like live search
[13:20:14] <Neo1> taplar: ok
[13:20:45] <Neo1> taplar: see I include this in project and spent again much time seeks in site how include this
[13:21:04] <grapheti> yeah, https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/ does the same thing
[13:21:08] <Neo1> taplar: maybe worth create snippets for sublime? Do you use snippets?
[13:21:30] <taplar> what does this have to do with the performance and speed question?
[13:22:28] <Neo1> grapheti: good, I added that to my the plugin collection
[13:22:42] <grapheti> Neo1, you're kind of going everywhere. We can prolly help you better if you stay on one topic at a time.
[13:22:43] <Neo1> taplar: direct relation
[13:23:05] <Neo1> taplar: it continue consume time
[13:23:13] <taplar> 'it'?
[13:23:18] <Neo1> do you use any snippets?
[13:23:27] <taplar> not really
[13:23:31] <Neo1> taplar: this action including select2
[13:23:38] <taplar> i'll look at examples to get a grasp of something some times
[13:23:42] <taplar> but i don't copy paste them
[13:23:49] <Neo1> taplar: I too, now think maybe worth use...
[13:24:50] <taplar> I'm still not sure what we're talking about
[13:24:54] <Neo1> I look always, but see would be good maybe create snippets for example one 'my_jq_select2_1 and my_jq_select2_2 ???
[13:25:16] <taplar> You mean making like a reference guide or something to usages of plugins?
[13:25:27] <Neo1> taplar: we talk about increase developing speed
[13:25:53] <Neo1> taplar: no this will not help, reference guide
[13:26:06] <Neo1> taplar: do you know sublime? and what is snippets?
[13:26:19] <Neo1> what are snippets
[13:26:26] <taplar> sublime, sure.  snippets, not sure what that is referring to
[13:26:50] <taplar> you mean like auto included code blocks?
[13:27:02] <Neo1> taplar: it's when you type for example 'fn' press type and you get the function definition
[13:27:08] <Neo1> taplar: yes
[13:27:37] <taplar> ok, so, sure.  if there are some code blocks that are basic, or generic, that you use often, that could be handy
[13:27:51] <Neo1> taplar: see we can create my_jq_select2_1 and it will add rows which will include files
[13:28:05] <Neo1> and my_jq_select2_2 will past example
[13:28:17] <taplar> sure
[13:28:37] <Neo1> and next time when I will need include select2, I will not see that site and seek example again, instead type this two row
[13:28:44] <grapheti> I call it intellisense :P
[13:28:57] <Neo1> taplar: it's maybe can make me little fast yes?
[13:29:13] <taplar> provided you remember what the snipplet is doing, sure
[13:29:14] <Neo1> this annoying when I always do all slow...
[13:29:43] <taplar> but if you get the snipplet and you don't remember what it is doing, and have to look it up anyway.  doesn't really buy you much
[13:29:51] <Neo1> taplar: yes, you can recall this, just type my_ and all snippets will show which start on my_
[13:29:57] <taplar> which is really where the development speed comes from
[13:30:04] <Neo1> snippet need repeat every day of course and learn
[13:30:09] <Neo1> but this maybe worth
[13:30:26] <taplar> understanding of the problem + understanding of common solution patterns + logic = development speed
[13:30:41] <taplar> to over simplify
[13:31:34] <Neo1> yes if you will not spend much time on including scripts you will have more time for understanding
[13:32:03] <taplar> but you could also argue that if you understand some things, the need for snipplets lessens
[13:32:11] <Neo1> I don't know, login also main, but this little things also need count
[13:33:13] <Neo1> I say you about one select2 but imagine like rule you need to include 5 libs to one project and how it's take time?
[13:33:29] <taplar> that's 5 lines of code
[13:33:41] <Neo1> you can't remember for everything how to include files and how work examples
[13:33:55] <taplar> it's called repetition man
[13:34:02] <taplar> you remember things
[13:34:16] <Neo1> but get this 5 row of code need to go on site and take it from there and see example
[13:34:29] <taplar> further more, if those 5 things are commonly included on your apps, you can bundle them and include one thing
[13:34:52] <Neo1> yes, I repeated including select2 3 or more times and always spend much time
[13:35:00] <taplar> not to mention there are probably options with build systems to auto include things for you so you don't have to
[13:35:34] <Neo1> no not build system
[13:35:46] <taplar> i'm simply saying.  not all situations are the same
[13:36:02] <Neo1> I think about build this system fro myself. But you really don't use any own snippets?
[13:36:08] <taplar> no
[13:36:12] <Neo1> taplar: are you very slow?
[13:36:18] <taplar> i don't think so
[13:36:36] <taplar> why would i be slow?
[13:37:01] <Neo1> you don't use snippets... I dont' know
[13:37:03] <Neo1> why
[13:37:06] <taplar> lol
[13:37:11] <Neo1> I just try understand why I so slow
[13:37:20] <Neo1> maybe I stupid (((
[13:37:21] <taplar> if you have a firm understanding of fundamentals, it's not that hard
[13:37:56] <taplar> it's all about experience and repetition
[13:38:03] <taplar> like i said, you'll remember things
[13:38:07] <Neo1> yes fundamentals understand, but routine works time consuming
[13:38:37] <Neo1> it's not work in my case, I need some app or something which make me very fast...
[13:38:37] <taplar> so let me ask you this
[13:38:48] <Neo1> ask about?
[13:38:52] <taplar> this seems to be coming from the viewpoint of starting from scratch
[13:39:12] <taplar> how often are you starting from scratch?
[13:39:27] <Neo1> no form scratch doesn't have sense something to do
[13:39:51] <taplar> so if you are not starting from scratch, then you are modifying something existing, right?
[13:40:15] <Neo1> now trying not starting. It haven't sense
[13:40:20] <taplar> or you have other pages you can copy and modify to work for the new solution, right?
[13:40:31] <Neo1> yes
[13:40:54] <taplar> so then really a lot of your time is saved right there
[13:41:16] <Neo1> from scratching it's will very slow...
[13:41:42] <Neo1> taplar: I recent only started use jQuery UI only first time
[13:42:59] <Neo1> select2, jQueryUI, bootstrap... this is my list plugins which frequently use http://prntscr.com/glld17
[13:43:25] <taplar> ok?
[13:43:33] <Neo1> taplar: what?
[13:43:49] <Neo1> taplar: yes possibly copy and modify
[13:44:00] <Neo1> taplar: but open old page also take time
[13:44:05] <taplar> lol
[13:44:09] <taplar> double click it, it's open
[13:44:11] <taplar> :)
[13:44:46] <taplar> if you have an issue with finding it, that's more of an organization issue
[13:44:52] <Neo1> taplar: seek folder, then seek file, then seek a code peace in file... Agree this is very much time?
[13:45:07] <taplar> not really
[13:45:12] <taplar> if you know where your stuff is
[13:45:18] <taplar> again, organization issue
[13:45:34] <Neo1> taplar: yes, but if you have a few projects and each projects use other plugins and you will seek whre need code peaces
[13:46:04] <Neo1> it's in folder, but there I difficult find something
[13:46:23] <taplar> then sure it might take a moment.  but it shouldn't be a large amount of time
[13:46:36] <taplar> though i might question why you are using such a varied amount of plugins
[13:46:44] <taplar> but maybe your a freelancer or something
[13:47:05] <Neo1> yes trying work on freelance and earn only there 200 - 400$
[13:47:30] <Neo1> I want improve speed and trying earn more, there speed is important
[13:47:48] <taplar> have you considered reducing your plugin base then?
[13:48:12] <Neo1> clients want speed, than faster than better for us both, I can earn more and client will satisfied
[13:48:23] <taplar> i'd rather have a freelancer that is damn good at a few things than not so good with lots of things
[13:48:54] <taplar> and there is some overlap with some plugins, like you mentioned jquery ui and bootstrap
[13:49:22] <Neo1> they are not compatible you think?
[13:49:33] <taplar> you can make them work together, but that's not the point
[13:49:41] <Neo1> I only in last project used jqueryUI for dialog window and this is very useful thing
[13:49:44] <taplar> both of them have their own approach to templating
[13:49:57] <taplar> if you are using them for page layout stuff, you don't really need both
[13:50:46] <Neo1> I want include all in my project, don't carry about bloated projects, about this nobody care
[13:50:54] <taplar> uh, yeah they do
[13:51:00] <taplar> lol
[13:51:09] <Neo1> taplar: and they compatible?
[13:51:18] <taplar> any business that cares anything about mobile is going to care about bloat
[13:51:26] <taplar> you tell me, :)
[13:51:49] <taplar> that's part of my point of the "i'd rather have a freelancer that is damn good at a few things than not so good with lots of things "
[13:51:56] <Neo1> taplar: I only used jQuery UI, at first started do dialog my own and then one guy advise to try UI and its amazing thing really... I even now impressed
[13:52:01] <taplar> you're spreading yourself out
[13:52:50] <taplar> bootstrap has modals built in too
[13:53:21] <taplar> https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-modals.php
[13:53:21] <Neo1> I bad understand how this translate , it means you prefer have a freelanceer ...
[13:53:32] <Neo1> oh understood
[13:53:41] <taplar> If i were to hire someone, I want them to know what they are doing.
[13:53:47] <Neo1> which know good a few things than many
[13:53:56] <Neo1> I understood
[13:54:10] <taplar> If that means you are very good at 2 things, rather than semi competent with 5 things, i'm ok with that
[13:54:23] <Neo1> this famous advise
[13:54:30] <taplar> but if you are in the semi competent area, i'm probably going to look for another freelancer
[13:54:56] <Neo1> yes, I on freelance try do only determined type of work related to wordpress
[13:55:15] <Neo1> other CMS don't review
[13:55:42] <pachet> any freelancer i hire has to know how to wield a halberd in battle
[13:55:51] <taplar> obviously
[13:56:02] <taplar> brb
[13:56:21] <Neo1> can't be good in all it's obviously
[13:56:29] <Neo1> you will very slow do work
[13:57:22] <Neo1> need to do work only from some domain, I do only from related wordpress, create plugins, but I bad developer, very slow.
[13:57:41] <Neo1> If I would do work faster i would get more 200 - 400$
[13:58:02] <Neo1> slow is worth downside for freelance...
[13:58:17] <Neo1> worse*
[13:59:21] <taplar> bak
[13:59:28] <Neo1> I think your own secrets how fast work no one will share....
[13:59:38] <taplar> right, so familiarity with the plugins you use will greatly increase your speed
[14:00:10] <taplar> plus your work history you can rely upon for working examples
[14:00:27] <Neo1> I will save all plugins to desk and made snippets for each
[14:00:29] <taplar> you just need to make sure to orgainize it in a way you can find stuff
[14:00:41] <taplar> why not keep a repo?
[14:01:15] <Neo1> repo in disk?
[14:01:23] <taplar> github offers free public repos.  if you care to make it private, since it's related to your work, you could pay for private repos
[14:01:27] <Neo1> yes I says about it
[14:02:08] <Neo1> taplar: see what I think about else, when you do on freelance from your hands passed many apps.....
[14:03:40] <Neo1> taplar: I sometimes have in months a few PSD designs. Frequently need to do little corrects for sites. Make inferences how can use this? I just did not use this opportunity and maybe in vain...
[14:04:09] <Neo1> taplar: I mean about store all worth sites for which I have access....
[14:04:33] <Neo1> make your own a sites database
[14:04:51] <taplar> you could repo those individually.  or you could repo individual files that demonstrate plugin usages for later reference
[14:04:56] <Neo1> taplar: how you look on this idea? Or this will take much time and not bring benefits?
[14:05:15] <taplar> then when you need to remember how to do plugin 'x', you look for that plugin file in the repo
[14:05:47] <taplar> i mean it's all up to you, whatever way of finding the reference is the quickest for you
[14:06:14] <Neo1> taplar: but better look in last plugin which you made, my last plugin not comparable with made in first
[14:06:35] <taplar> last plugin you made ?
[14:06:42] <Neo1> taplar: yes now ill care about this
[14:06:55] <Neo1> taplar: last plugins, yes
[14:06:57] <taplar> are you creating plugins?
[14:07:02] <Neo1> taplar: I mean wp plugin
[14:07:05] <taplar> k
[14:08:14] <Neo1> taplar: last plugins are better structured and make with jQuery libs. And I more skillful after each projects. It's really each project makes you better...
[14:08:32] <taplar> sure
[14:08:39] <Neo1> taplar: what do you think about create a site database?
[14:08:58] <Neo1> taplar: allocate place on disc
[14:08:59] <taplar> elaborate?
[14:09:10] <taplar> i'd use a repo personally
[14:09:12] <Neo1> taplar: gathering
[14:09:17] <Neo1> taplar: collect sites
[14:09:29] <Neo1> taplar: listen the idea
[14:09:33] <taplar> yeah, i'd use repos
[14:09:41] <Neo1> taplar: no in local computer
[14:09:48] <taplar> right, no, i'd use a repo
[14:09:58] <taplar> your local computer can crash and burn, blue screen
[14:10:00] <taplar> then your fked
[14:10:53] <Neo1> do you use local server? Repo not suited for collection. I mean about real collection. when you can in browther access each site
[14:11:05] <taplar> we use repos for our projects
[14:11:24] <taplar> we make our changes to the repos, and our deployment scripts build and deploy from those repos
[14:11:32] <Neo1> taplar: but in repo you can't see site in browser, for this need server
[14:11:39] <taplar> sure you can
[14:11:47] <taplar> dude, a repo is just a method of storing the information
[14:11:52] <Neo1> no, need host
[14:11:58] <Neo1> I now this disk
[14:12:01] <taplar> you checkout/clone the project from the repo to your local machine and do whatever with it
[14:12:13] <taplar> but your repo acts as your master backup/storage
[14:12:16] <Neo1> but I mean about the collection of sites on wordpress
[14:12:24] <taplar> same thing
[14:12:31] <taplar> you could have a repo per site
[14:12:33] <Neo1> taplar: no, you did not understood me
[14:13:01] <Neo1> taplar: but it's will not useful search between big amount sites
[14:13:24] <Neo1> taplar: between a big sites amount*
[14:13:31] <taplar> sure, cause you're not searching for sites.  your searching for wp plugins
[14:13:51] <taplar> which is why i said before you could make a repo with specific fines for each wp plugin
[14:13:53] <Neo1> I want something else than store code. I want make showcase...
[14:14:18] <Neo1> taplar: no. on freelance clients need do sites at first
[14:15:10] <taplar> we're talking about archiving previous work
[14:15:13] <taplar> not new work
[14:15:29] <taplar> but you can always make a show case site
[14:15:58] <Neo1> again
[14:16:02] <Neo1> not
[14:16:19] <Neo1> main idea create your own a site collection
[14:16:44] <Neo1> taplar: a site showcase, not showcase site
[14:16:56] <taplar> so a site that links to the other sites?
[14:17:21] <Neo1> yes, from your collection
[14:17:53] <Neo1> taplar: I mean it's can use for future. Do you have some sites now?
[14:18:15] <Neo1>  what you can offer now your clients? What you can show them?
[14:18:16] <taplar> my apps are intranet sites mostly
[14:18:25] <taplar> I don't
[14:18:30] <Neo1> yes I too
[14:18:39] <taplar> They tell me what they want.  We make it
[14:19:11] <Neo1> taplar: imagine now other situation, you have 100 sites, a few internet shops, you have many stored designs...
[14:19:47] <Neo1> taplar: but do you see there some freelancers do stores for 100 - 200$, do you thing the do them from scratch?
[14:20:11] <taplar> i doubt most freelancers work from scratch after a point
[14:20:26] <Neo1> taplar: and nothing earn
[14:20:36] <taplar> what?
[14:20:44] <Neo1> taplar: see one example, let's together break down!
[14:20:55] <taplar> i don't understand that last statement
[14:21:26] <Neo1> taplar: and nothing earn this? It's means they work and nothing get. Now understood?
[14:21:41] <taplar> how does that relate to my not working from scratch statement?
[14:21:51] <taplar> that just means they have previous work to use for new work
[14:21:57] <taplar> doesn't mean they don't earn anything
[14:22:54] <Neo1> taplar: oh, did you try to do site from a scratch?
[14:23:06] <taplar> i've done sites from scratch, sure
[14:23:17] <Neo1> taplar: I so long type because trying correct errors which notices...
[14:23:30] <taplar> but you're changing the subject
[14:23:35] <taplar> you said they don't earn anything
[14:23:47] <taplar> what do you mean by that, related to not working from scratch
[14:24:42] <Neo1> taplar: and you understand how much it takes time. And now envision you will do that site for 100 - 200$ How much you will earn on freelance?
[14:24:59] <taplar> why would I agree to do it for $100-$200?
[14:25:43] <taplar> If i thought it was a simple enough site, maybe, but that is entirely situational
[14:26:59] <Neo1> taplar: because on freelance no one will pay you more for this, because your a counterpart can be agree do this even cheaper.
[14:27:48] <taplar> so they hire the other guy
[14:28:22] <Neo1> taplar: you frequently think it's simple site and like always we are wrong. Doesn't matter. it's not theme. I mean you will not do sites from scratch on freelance
[14:28:37] <Neo1> taplar: yes, they hire other guy and you will without work....
[14:28:40] <taplar> I didn't say you would do sites on freelance
[14:28:57] <taplar> "taplar
[14:28:57] <taplar> "taplar: i doubt most freelancers work from scratch after a point"
[14:29:09] <Neo1> taplar: you should increase speed and do faster, making 10 sites on 200$ you get good salary 2000$, its not bad
[14:29:25] <Neo1> understood
[14:29:44] <Neo1> you got main idea?
[14:30:09] <Neo1> about a sites collection?
[14:30:31] <taplar> not in regards to increasing your development speed
[14:30:59] <Neo1> yes development speed
[14:31:15] <Neo1> see example, break down one example
[14:31:44] <taplar> if a sites collection will do that for you, go for it
[14:32:04] <Neo1> assume you have 5 shops in your local server, these are differ stores wholly work, with need plugins
[14:33:30] <Neo1> than bit on project where need to create shops. Say clients about variants how you can do for theme.  They agreed. You need only little to customize your shops and sell
[14:34:04] <Neo1> it's will increase your developing performance significant and you can earn making sites on 100 - 200$ really
[14:34:09] <Neo1> or not?
[14:35:02] <taplar> this really sounds like you are talking about a showcase site
[14:35:13] <Neo1> taplar: I wish about creating a site collections for this. What do you think about this idea? Theoretically this is maybe worth?
[14:35:13] <taplar> showcasing your different themes
[14:36:15] <Neo1> taplar: showcase in meaning to show client's. Your collection it's like a showcase in a shop
[14:36:25] <taplar> right
[14:36:31] <taplar> of themes, ye?
[14:36:33] <taplar> *yes
[14:36:59] <Neo1> taplar: no each site will a separated wordpress site installed on your local server
[14:37:16] <taplar> lol, ok, whatever form it takes
[14:37:22] <Neo1> taplar: you can type in borwser site1 and you access it
[14:37:29] <taplar> you are showing off the different layouts/themes/whatever that you've maid
[14:37:30] <taplar> *made
[14:37:37] <taplar> basicly a digital portfolio
[14:37:53] <Neo1> taplar: do you know WAMP?
[14:38:13] <taplar> sure, but could you answer the last question?
[14:39:18] <Neo1> taplar: not portfolio, in portfolio you will place only your work, in this you will place any sites. Yes it's may call a digital portfolio
[14:39:44] <taplar> why would you place 'any' site?  why would you place sites you didn't make?
[14:40:28] <Neo1> no any only on wordpress
[14:40:52] <taplar> what?
[14:41:11] <Neo1> taplar: not any sites, only which use wordpress
[14:41:23] <taplar> lol, where did i specify wordpress
[14:41:32] <taplar> or not specify wordpres
[14:41:38] <taplar> you're showing your stuff
[14:41:45] <taplar> if that happens to be wordpress stuff, whatever
[14:41:47] <taplar> it's your stuff
[14:41:52] <Neo1> taplar: yes and will use
[14:42:24] <taplar> that's entirely reasonable.  the concept of a digital portfolio to show to perspective buyers makes lots of sense
[14:42:24] <Neo1> taplar: but why don't use sites which you did not do if you have this site?
[14:42:49] <taplar> cause you don't want to showcase sites you did not make
[14:42:50] <Neo1> taplar: if you can copy a site and save on your computer, why you can't use it in future?
[14:43:01] <taplar> you'd run the risk of someone saying you are claiming their work
[14:43:11] <taplar> which is copyright infringement risk
[14:43:22] <taplar> you can do that.  but if you sell it
[14:43:26] <taplar> you run the risk
[14:43:41] <Neo1> taplar: but you can use it like a foundation for a site, little customize, change front and and you have new site
[14:44:05] <taplar> dude, if you want to do that, whatever.  i'm not going to advocate it
[14:45:00] <taplar> if i was a wp developer and i saw a site that was highly like my design, which I probably put a lot of effort into making, I know i'd be pissed and probably seek compensation
[14:45:07] <Neo1> no I don't do this, but I wish create collection. I think this have to increase developing performance significant
[14:45:50] <Neo1> taplar: really? I think it's for you will not matter, You made work and forgot about
[14:46:05] <Neo1> made the work*
[14:46:08] <taplar> not if it's my livelyhood
[14:46:27] <taplar> you're concerned with making more than $100-200.  me too.  if i'm a wp developer too
[14:46:33] <Neo1> but this not bring you money
[14:46:46] <taplar> right, it brought you money, from taking something i made and tweaking it
[14:47:22] <Neo1> you need to spend money on a court and you are not sure you win. Just spend time and money in vain
[14:47:36] <taplar> lol, i'm not going to discuss this anymore
[14:47:42] <Neo1> taplar: yes, you catch a main idea. It's good
[14:48:02] <Neo1> no passed this. I think it worth do or not?
[14:48:11] <Neo1> I have nothing
[14:48:52] <Neo1> My one friend making stores using wp tamplates, he called this a making sites on templates
[14:49:24] <Neo1> buy one premium WP theme, customize it and made 20 sites on it
[14:50:19] <taplar> i don't know the legality of it.  but it most likely depends on how much you customize it, and under what terms you purchased the original theme
[14:50:27] <Neo1> he use the same foundation for 20 sites... He has very high performance and not bad earn...
[14:50:57] <Neo1> he hired me sometimes to help him customize those wp themes.
[14:51:34] <Neo1> taplar: for one template impossible customize more than one week
[14:51:58] <Neo1> one week, and no more. I spoke with him
[14:52:46] <Neo1> there all installed on stream. conveyor...
[14:53:18] <taplar> so if it sounds good, go for it
[14:53:28] <Neo1> Speaking with him I also started thinking about this notions like speed, performance, streamline... and whatnot...
[14:54:22] <Neo1> taplar: really sound good?
[14:54:48] <taplar> if it sounds good -to you-, do it, :)
[14:55:22] <Neo1> I to try
[14:55:40] <Neo1> I only recent got this good idea
[14:58:00] <Neo1> taplar: ok, and you are a native speaker? Do you understand good my English? I tried to write correctly...
[14:58:23] <taplar> I'm native english.
[14:59:37] <Neo1> How my English? is very horrible? I always getting much critics about it. Even people don't want speak with me from this...
[15:00:19] <Neo1> Or maybe because I obsessive to them much and sometimes insulting. They said I insulted them
[15:00:22] <taplar> I can gather the majority of what you are saying.  Sometimes I have to ask for clarification though, as you've seen.
[15:00:42] <Neo1> yes it's good, I'm glad
[15:01:14] <Neo1> and I understood you
[15:02:18] <Neo1> even that phrase about freelancer knowledge I understood without translator.  And spoke with you without translator honesty
[15:02:32] <Neo1> a few words only translate using it...
[15:02:49] <Neo1> translated*
[15:03:20] <Neo1> and honestly*
[15:34:01] <sine0> is it possible to read from an input text box constantly, like letter by letter update. I have a form where the jQ does some calc but if they dont click off the input field it doesnt 'change'
[15:34:19] <sine0> when they press the submit button it takes the amount from the last update
[15:34:31] <taplar> 'input' first for each input change to a text box
[15:34:36] <taplar> r/first/fires
[15:35:02] <sine0> what do you mean
[15:35:14] <taplar> 'change' happens once the focus of the element is lost
[15:35:19] <sine0> ok
[15:35:21] <taplar> 'input' happens any time the value of the field changes
[15:35:32] <sine0> amazing grace.
[15:38:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pfreyz9a/
[15:42:51] <sine0> interesting way of using the id variable
[15:50:16] <grapheti> who needs react when you have taplar
[15:50:37] <taplar> :O
[15:50:44] * taplar 's heart pitter patters
[15:52:54] <taplar> honestly though I am interested in the day that we get broad mutation observer events
[15:53:55] <taplar> sorry, under the passenger area
[15:54:00] <taplar> bah, wrong window
[15:54:00] <grapheti> ye, that will be nice
[15:54:27] <grapheti> until then, https://redom.js.org/
[15:54:31] <grapheti> lol
[15:55:58] <taplar> huh
[16:02:18] <taplar> heh, you can tell these guys are programmers
[16:06:00] <sine0> ok so Im trying to do some math on variable but the + is appending them like strings
[16:06:08] <sine0> do i have to convert them to integers
[16:06:11] <sine0> var a = jQuery('#input_1_7').val();
[16:06:14] <taplar> yup
[16:06:59] <sine0> parseint
[16:07:05] <sine0> ?
[16:07:13] <taplar> is it an integer or a float?
[16:07:20] <sine0> int
[16:07:29] <sine0> no decimals
[16:07:29] <taplar> parseInt(theString, 10)
[16:09:50] <sine0> ok so whats wrong with this, I get NaN
[16:09:53] <sine0> https://codepaste.net/3av31i
[16:10:32] <taplar> what value is in the inputs?
[16:10:52] <taplar> empty string would be NaN
[16:11:04] <sine0> well, one of them
[16:11:55] <sine0> I thought it would add the nothing as 0 and still get a restul
[16:12:00] <sine0> var a,b,c = 0;
[16:12:00] <sine0> ?
[16:12:02] <sine0> before
[16:12:03] <taplar> heh
[16:12:15] <taplar> your dealing with javascript, ;)  don't assume things
[16:12:46] <taplar> try putting this at the end of your value lookups
[16:12:50] <taplar> || "0"
[16:13:27] <sine0> kk
[16:13:30] <sine0> OR
[16:36:58] <aFeijo> hi guys
[16:37:32] <aFeijo> I made this function   $.fn.popup_dialog = function(str) that works well with $('something').popup_dialog, but it dont work as $.popup_dialog, what is missing here?
[16:37:47] <taplar> you made it a $.fn method
[16:37:53] <taplar> it will only work on jquery objects
[16:38:03] <aFeijo> it works with $().popup tho
[16:38:07] <taplar> right
[16:38:16] <taplar> $(selector) creates a jquery object containing results
[16:38:18] <aFeijo> taplar, how can I change it? straight $.popup_dialog = function?
[16:38:24] <taplar> sure
[16:38:29] <aFeijo> nice! thanks
[16:39:04] <aFeijo> yeah, works!!!
[16:39:06] <aFeijo> taplar++
[18:25:45] <MaxLeiter> how should I do this in jquery? https://sr.ht/hr3i.txt
[18:25:51] <MaxLeiter> currently doing this: https://sr.ht/-oN6.txt
[18:28:15] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter that won't work because you're using a fat arrow.
[18:28:23] <robertmaxrees> needs to be function() if you wanna use $(this)
[18:28:36] <hellyeah> far arrow => ?
[18:28:39] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:28:40] <hellyeah> es6 notation?
[18:28:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[18:28:46] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:29:04] <hellyeah> i really dont care about arrow function. Should i care?
[18:29:09] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you should.
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter jquery uses .bind() on callbacks to set 'this' to the DOM node.  you can't bind fat arrows.
[18:29:25] <MaxLeiter> ah, cool
[18:29:26] <MaxLeiter> thanks robertmaxrees
[18:29:47] <robertmaxrees> optionally, you could do (e) => $(event.target)
[18:29:50] <robertmaxrees> err,
[18:30:11] <robertmaxrees> optionally, you could do (index, element) => $(element)
[18:33:18] <hellyeah> is it better way to write something?
[18:34:42] <hellyeah> =£
[18:34:44] <hellyeah> ops
[18:34:46] <hellyeah> =>
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah fat arrows are really nice for small array operations like reducers or foreach.
[18:37:34] <robertmaxrees> someArray.some(someObject => someObject.someProperty);
[18:38:00] <robertmaxrees> when you use this syntax, it's automatically returning the expression.
[18:38:03] <MaxLeiter> 				$("[aria-label]").attr("aria-label", (i, val) => {return i18n.t(val); });
[18:38:06] <MaxLeiter> is what I finished with
[18:38:17] <hellyeah> is it like immediate execution?
[18:38:21] <MaxLeiter> i dont think the { } or return should be necessary, but doesnt work without them
[18:38:26] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it's a function...
[18:38:28] <MaxLeiter> => i18n.t() should work fine
[18:38:54] <hellyeah> yeah function is called right away right
[18:38:59] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter try $("[aria-label]").attr("aria-label", (i, val) => i18n.t(val));
[18:39:00] <hellyeah> i will check it
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it behaves like a normal function in that regard.
[18:40:02] <MaxLeiter> yeah thats what I did robertmaxrees
[18:40:03] <MaxLeiter> but didnt work
[18:40:06] <MaxLeiter> so wrapped in {} with a return
[18:40:15] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter hrm.
[18:40:24] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[18:40:26] <MaxLeiter> wait
[18:40:29] <MaxLeiter> maybe it works now
[18:40:31] <MaxLeiter> weird
[18:42:49] <robertmaxrees> MaxLeiter well.
[18:43:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay that should work fine.
[20:54:35] <impliednude> has anyone ever encountered a jcarousel that instead of going through the divs present that it tries to bounce back and it gets "stuck"
