[02:04:48] <jnewt> trying to use serializeJSON() for a form, but the type="number" inputs are ending up converted to strings.   what determines whether it ends up a string like "id":"1" or a number like "id":1 ?
[02:13:27] <pavonia> It always uses string, IIRC, unless you specify a type explcitly in the name field
[02:16:24] <pavonia> see https://github.com/marioizquierdo/jquery.serializeJSON#parse-values-with-types
[08:54:21] <paule32> hello
[08:54:43] <paule32> i have problems with dragging/move div: https://jsfiddle.net/zv8st5k2/2/
[09:19:03] <paule32> i have update the script:  https://jsfiddle.net/zv8st5k2/8/
[09:19:10] <paule32> still not working
[12:18:59] <jnewt> using serializeJSON, trying to figure out how to name my form inputs to get an array as opposed to an object.
[12:19:12] <jnewt> can't seem to find any examples
[12:19:53] <jnewt> or possibly use serializeArray on part of a form?
[12:23:07] <jnewt> https://medium.com/@mwakatumbula_/code-15ecdb18c2ef shows an example where jobbies[] name ends up as an array, but projects doesn't. is it the [0] vs [] that makes the difference?
[17:30:14] <Cork> jnewt: serializeArray shouldn't matter with serializeArray, if you send it as params php requires the [] to handle the input correctly
[17:30:46] <Cork> never used serializeJSON so not sure what your talking about there
[17:31:37] <jnewt> Cork, figured it out, had to change from the [0] naming to the [] to get it to spit out an array of objects instead of an object full of objects
[17:33:02] <Cork> ya, that is param standard behavior
