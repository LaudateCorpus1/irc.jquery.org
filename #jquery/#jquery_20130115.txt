[00:00:14] <Nebros_> and i know that my code doesent work in jsfiddle correctly, the value list is an input out of django commands... i just need the correct the js code. the rest i can fix by myself... :)
[00:00:26] <sCoRpi_> check the url, i already fixed it ;)
[00:00:33] <seba4> thx ajpiano ..
[00:00:43] <Nebros_> and my german is better than my englisch... ^^
[00:00:48] <sCoRpi_> you didn't reference your form correctly. you were missing the '#' in front of your id selector
[00:00:51] <sCoRpi_> ok
[00:00:55] <sCoRpi_> du hast was vergessen
[00:01:00] <sCoRpi_> die raute vor der id
[00:01:03] <sCoRpi_> jetzt stimmt es
[00:01:08] <marcules> Morning
[00:01:15] <Nebros_> ohh, sry hab den link Ã¼bersehen
[00:01:16] <sCoRpi_> morning
[00:01:21] <Nebros_> thx :)
[00:01:25] <sCoRpi_> np
[00:01:35] <Nebros_> hi marcules :)
[00:02:36] <marcules> Gab es eigentlich nen deutschen jQuery-Raum? ^^
[00:02:41] <marcules> Oder ist da nur nichts los?
[00:03:54] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_ :D
[00:04:24] <sCoRpi_> ajpiano: isn't it like early in the morning at your place?
[00:04:29] <sCoRpi_> hey whiskey
[00:04:30] <ajpiano> it's 3am
[00:04:35] <sCoRpi_> working late?
[00:04:38] <Nebros_> da waren heut morgen grad mal 2 on. ^^
[00:04:41] <marcules> 3am - late? :D
[00:09:40] <miCSu> I'm guessing jquery ui switchClass method isn't compatible with changing background from like background-image: linear-gradient(..) to single color?
[00:11:54] <DrDank> Anyone suggest a 'image zoomer' Ive tried two of them and none of them are exactly what Im looking for.
[00:14:31] <marcules> miCSu, I think this won't work with "animate" either
[00:14:41] <marcules> Didn't try it though
[00:15:34] <marcules> I would implement a container with your colour at opacity:0, animating it, setting your container to that colour and afterwards removing the temporary container
[00:15:46] <marcules> -container +eleme nt
[00:19:06] <DrDank> I have 3 nested elements.. and I need to route this function.. how would I do so? function is ('a.zoom') but the element I need the a href to be selected in is #twoColRtHdr #sidebar1
[00:19:12] <DrDank> 2 nested*
[00:19:15] <DrDank> sorry, just learning jquery
[00:20:55] <Qbix1> is there a room for jquery tools?
[00:21:04] <Qbix1> does anyone still use them / recommend them?
[00:21:28] <Qbix1> my favorite js library maintainer is Oyvind Sean Kinsey (easyxdm), and the jquery tools guy tries to be very helpful too :)
[00:24:15] <DrDank> Anyone? It being in a nested element is whats causing it not to work.. cant figure out how to select that element
[00:25:39] <ejnahc> i'm using code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js and jQuery.browser is undefined. what's wrong?
[00:29:28] <Nebros_> sCoRpi_: i dont know why, but the function will not work. i have checked with my other js but i cant found the fail. :(
[00:33:10] <sCoRpi_> Nebros_: upload an more complete example to jsfiddle then :)
[00:34:04] <Nebros_> i can only upload the full html, the rest is complete
[00:34:37] <sCoRpi_> if you have no other javascript it should work
[00:34:46] <Nebros_> but the rest have nothing to do with this js
[00:34:52] <Nebros_> hmm
[00:34:57] <Nebros_> there are more...
[00:35:01] <Nebros_> mom
[00:35:14] <sCoRpi_> did you check your console for errors?
[00:35:22] <Qbix1> this happens after the submit handler function already runs, and calls event.preventDefault()
[00:35:26] <Qbix1> very weird bug, I submit a form and somewhere in the jquery code I get this: TypeError: Cannot call method 'toLowerCase' of undefined
[00:35:37] <Qbix1> any clue as to what could cause this normally?
[00:35:58] <sCoRpi_> ajpiano has a nice site up: fixingthesejquery.com if you are not familar with debugging tools for JS you might want to check it out
[00:36:13] <Qbix1> what's that
[00:36:14] <sCoRpi_> Qbix1: i answered your question about an hour ago
[00:36:19] <Qbix1> oh, cool
[00:36:27] <Qbix1> scorpi_ : must have missed it, still trying to debug :(
[00:36:36] <ajpiano> ejnahc: that's jQuery 1.9 :)
[00:36:50] <ajpiano> there is no jQuery.browser
[00:36:53] <sCoRpi_> browser got dropped in 1.9?
[00:36:57] <ajpiano> yup
[00:37:03] <sCoRpi_> yay for feature detection \o/
[00:37:19] <ajpiano> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[00:37:55] <sCoRpi_> oh btw ajpiano,  the kid on fixingthesejquery.com on the first picture - that's not a child photograph of yourself is it? ;D
[00:38:01] <ajpiano> it is :D
[00:38:32] <Qbix1> what was your answer scorpi_ ?
[00:38:56] <sCoRpi_> [09:42] <sCoRpi> Qbix1: you are trying to call toLowerCase() on a variable i guess
[00:38:56] <sCoRpi_> [09:42] <sCoRpi> and that one is undefined
[00:38:56] <sCoRpi_> [09:42] <sCoRpi> hence the value you are trying to assign to it, isn't defined
[00:39:02] <sCoRpi_> [09:43] <sCoRpi> Qbix1: start debugging your code after the call to preventDefault(), check your assignments
[00:39:44] <ajpiano> Qbix1: what you should actually do is either do "break on all uncaught exceptions" in your debugger and step up the call chain to find out what of your code is triggering the exception in jquey
[00:40:00] <ajpiano> or make a test case that duplicates the issue so other people can see the problem and help you with it
[00:40:01] <Qbix1> well that much is obvious
[00:40:13] <Qbix1> the thing is, all the call stack in between is in the jquery.min.js file
[00:40:14] <sCoRpi_> ^what he said up there is much better
[00:40:16] <Qbix1> jquery.tools.min.js
[00:40:31] <ajpiano> jquery tools is not the same as jquery
[00:40:36] <Qbix1> I know
[00:40:41] <sCoRpi_> ajpiano: oh reeally :D I was just guessing because of the hair ;)
[00:40:44] <Qbix1> wish I could unminify it
[00:40:46] <ajpiano> heh, yeah, it's me
[00:40:53] <Qbix1> how do I "break on all uncaught exceptions" ?
[00:40:55] <Qbix1> in webkit
[00:40:56] <ajpiano> Qbix1: you can get unminified versions of jquery and jquery tools
[00:40:57] <Qbix1> in chrome
[00:41:07] <ajpiano> Qbix1: click the little grey pause button until it's purple
[00:41:07] <Qbix1> ajpiano I can't seem to get the compiled unminified version
[00:41:17] <Qbix1> okay, sec.
[00:41:43] <Qbix1> clicked it, etc. is that a joke?
[00:41:46] <Qbix1> it's not purple
[00:41:52] <sCoRpi_> click it twice
[00:41:57] <Qbix1> it just pauses and unpauses
[00:42:05] <Qbix1> I am in Chrome
[00:42:11] <sCoRpi_> go to the "sources" tab
[00:42:14] <ajpiano> ^^
[00:42:15] <sCoRpi_> at the bottom
[00:42:19] <ajpiano> it should turn blue and then purple
[00:42:21] <sCoRpi_> there is a pause icon
[00:42:24] <sCoRpi_> 4th from the left
[00:42:27] <sCoRpi_> click it twice
[00:42:28] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/2W0Y1X2l3m26
[00:42:33] <Qbix1> bottom?
[00:42:38] <Qbix1> sec, will click on cl.y
[00:42:51] <sCoRpi_> but cl.ly will not turn purple if you click it
[00:43:57] <Nebros_> sCoRpi_: my fiddle want work... ^^ it takes a few minutes till it works. :(
[00:44:12] <sCoRpi_> Nebros_ take your take
[00:44:50] <Qbix1> this is what I see: http://cl.ly/image/0C022k0A1z3K
[00:45:01] <ssbr`> Hey folks, can anyone help me figure out why my jQuery UI widget doesn't work? I can call $(...).mywidget() fine, but _create isn't called, and I don't know why.
[00:45:11] <Qbix1> I must have an older version of chrome
[00:45:16] <ssbr`> http://bpaste.net/show/8wmcyYGa9gYcfWQhQk0F/ <-- "hello" and "there" are printed, but not "wheeee" etc.
[00:45:44] <ajpiano> Qbix1: without a live testcase it's hard for us to really know how to make heads or tales out of there
[00:46:21] <Qbix1> well I can set up a live test case at http://qbix.com
[00:46:28] <Qbix1> must be something silly
[00:46:31] <Qbix1> something must be undefined
[00:46:52] <Qbix1> my guess is, probably some jquery tools attaches some validator to the form or osmething
[00:46:52] <esk_> good morning from gmt +1 :D
[00:46:59] <ajpiano> ssbr`: what is .addTo :p
[00:47:00] <Qbix1> I can use jsbeautifier to unminify it
[00:47:04] <Qbix1> and try to step through
[00:47:04] <sCoRpi_> o>
[00:47:21] <ajpiano> Qbix1: my guess is a version incompaitbility between jquery and jquery tools, but that's just a guess
[00:47:23] <ssbr`> ajpiano: I don't know, code I copied from somewhere
[00:47:31] <ajpiano> ssbr`: there's no such jquery method
[00:47:39] <ssbr`> ajpiano: OK, but that's not my problem :S
[00:47:44] <Nebros_> why is behind my name this _ ? ^^
[00:47:53] <esk_> because Nebros was taken
[00:48:00] <Nebros_> kk
[00:48:12] <Qbix1> ajpiano - it's a nice guess, but jquery.tools.min.js includes jquer
[00:48:16] <ssbr`> ajpiano: I've commented out those lines.
[00:48:16] <Qbix1> it came with it
[00:48:21] <ssbr`> Still no dice.
[00:48:29] <Qbix1> let me see if I have another jquery.js
[00:48:34] <Qbix1> in the same doc. hopefully not
[00:48:46] <Qbix1> nope, it's all kosher
[00:49:26] <Qbix1> https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/eaef7f3e3c806dce9db894a2737dbb9f4358fad0/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f724a4567312e706e67
[00:49:45] <ajpiano> ssbr`: if you actually select an element on the page
[00:49:55] <ajpiano> do you then get a create ?
[00:50:02] <ajpiano> there is no #timeline in the .html
[00:50:19] <ajpiano> uch jquery 1.5.1
[00:50:24] <ajpiano> no one should ever be using jquery 1.5.1
[00:50:27] <ajpiano> it was out for like a  week
[00:50:42] <ssbr`> ajpiano: UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH
[00:50:44] <ssbr`> ajpiano: Okay.
[00:50:54] <ssbr`> ajpiano: How do I make jQuery not silently fail if I make a stupid mistake like that?
[00:51:00] <ssbr`> silent failure is completely wrong and terrible
[00:51:24] <ssbr`> that worked
[00:51:31] <ssbr`> God damn, that is completely outrageous
[00:51:35] <ajpiano> ok a month
[00:51:39] <Taggnostr> What's the best way to select and hide 'foo: ' in "<label>foo: <input></label>"?
[00:51:53] <ssbr`> ajpiano: How should I prevent this in the future?
[00:52:03] <ajpiano> ssbr`: you can test the lenght of a jquery object before calling methods on it
[00:52:06] <Nebros_> sCoRpi_:http://jsfiddle.net/2CPLP/9/
[00:52:17] <ssbr`> ajpiano: no way to do this automatically?
[00:52:22] <ajpiano> not really
[00:52:46] <ajpiano> a lot of the $.fn. methods are iterators... if there's nothing to iterate, it just doesn't do anything
[00:53:03] <jkarsrud> isn't setDate the method you're supposed to use when you want to show a different date than minDate as selected in the UI datepicker?
[00:53:48] <sCoRpi_> offtopic: does anybody know a html validator which will crawl a site and validate each subpage?
[00:54:37] <ssbr`> ajpiano: alright, well, thanks
[00:54:48] <Qbix1> yay! jsbeautifier to the rescue
[00:54:50] <Qbix1> was able to debugger; it
[00:55:07] <jkarsrud> I have this stuff; http://pastie.org/5687206 but that doesn't seem to do anything
[00:55:30] <Qbix1> so it turns out that the form's nodeName is empty
[00:55:32] <Qbix1> I mean undefined
[00:55:40] <Qbix1> form.nodeName is undefined.
[00:55:43] <Qbix1> Why would that be?
[00:55:50] <Qbix1> jquery tools barfs at that point
[00:56:11] <Qbix1> That is DOM Level 2
[00:56:32] <Qbix1> form is inserted into the body
[00:57:27] <Qbix1> aha! the .nodeName is being called on the jquery object
[00:58:00] <sCoRpi_> like $('form).nodeName?
[00:58:07] <Qbix1> yeah
[00:58:17] <sCoRpi_> you only got one form?
[00:58:19] <Qbix1> like it's calling it on the jquery instead of the element, that's why it throws.
[00:58:25] <Qbix1> well in that jquery, yes
[00:58:35] <sCoRpi_> ok, if that selector only returns one result
[00:58:36] <sCoRpi_> try
[00:58:38] <Qbix1> all I do is this: $(this).closest('form').submit();
[00:58:44] <sCoRpi_> $('selector')[0].nodeName
[00:58:53] <Qbix1> well the thing is, the nodeName is inside jquerytools
[00:58:56] <sCoRpi_> ah
[00:58:57] <Qbix1> I am trying to see where I am going wrong
[00:59:03] <Qbix1> I unminified it to debug it
[00:59:54] <Qbix1> turns out that the event target is a jquery!!
[01:00:01] <Qbix1> shouldn't the target be an element?
[01:00:05] <Qbix1> in normal jquery?
[01:01:10] <jkarsrud> ajpiano: Any idea why this doesn't work? http://pastie.org/5687223
[01:01:33] <Qbix1> I am getting closer to the answer
[01:01:44] <Qbix1> event.target winds up being a jquery insted of an element
[01:02:02] <Qbix1> http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[01:02:38] <ajpiano> jkarsrud: not really, not enough context
[01:02:46] <ajpiano> yeah, it should be a regular element Qbix1
[01:03:00] <ajpiano> sounds like jquery tools is having a grand old time with some form semantics
[01:03:36] <Qbix1> well to be honest, it's not obvious to me that jquery tools is responsible
[01:03:48] <Qbix1> basically what I did was register a submit handler for the form
[01:03:53] <Qbix1> then called .submit( ) on the form
[01:04:05] <Qbix1> and I am sitting here with a jQuery instead of a DOMNode as the event.target. wack.
[01:04:32] <Qbix1> look at this, ajpiano: http://cl.ly/image/393T2j1L2P3Z
[01:04:46] <jkarsrud> ajpiano: yeah, sorry about that; http://pastie.org/5687234
[01:05:00] <jkarsrud> does that help any more?
[01:05:34] <ajpiano> Qbix1: so what about this line in jQuery tools where if you're using their validator, it overwrites e.target with a jQuery object: https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/blob/master/src/validator/validator.js#L539
[01:05:45] <ajpiano> :/
[01:06:09] <Qbix1> hmm, you may be onto something? let me see
[01:06:37] <Qbix1> bah, I suspected the validator ? but in what event does it do that?
[01:06:51] <Qbix1> I guess I will try to unbind .V namespace?
[01:07:01] <ajpiano> when it submits
[01:08:32] <ajpiano> you shouldn't go messing about with the internals of plugins where you don't understand how they work
[01:09:02] <Qbix1> ajpiano: well I can intuitively try to guess what happened
[01:09:16] <Qbix1> jquery tools was coded to intercept the validation and add its own submit handler
[01:09:29] <Qbix1> I mean it was coded to add its own submit handler
[01:09:42] <Qbix1> and for whatever reason, it sets the target incorrectly to a jquery
[01:09:57] <ajpiano> and then later something tries to use the target and it blows up
[01:10:20] <ajpiano> so there is exhibit Z that jQuery Tools is to be avoided :/
[01:10:44] <Qbix1> yes.
[01:10:46] <Qbix1> http://jquerytools.org/documentation/validator/index.html
[01:10:59] <Qbix1> "It takes the best parts of HTML 5 and Web Forms 2.0 standards and turns them into something pure amazing." -- yes amazing crap
[01:11:27] <ajpiano> jkarsrud: not really, i would imagine that if it's not working it has something to diwht invalid input
[01:11:32] <ajpiano> but i'm too sleepy, need to go to sleep
[01:11:36] <jkarsrud> yeah, sure :)
[01:11:37] <Qbix1> the jqtools guy means well but really, I do not think his library is that bug-free, it always seemed a bit rickety
[01:11:57] <jkarsrud> I'm passing in a unix timestamp and the date is correct, so I'll keep digging :)
[01:12:07] <Qbix1> ajpiano good on you for finding that e.target = form line
[01:12:14] <Qbix1> how did you do it so fast?
[01:12:35] <Qbix1> form.on(?) and then he does e.target = form !! it's a freaking bug!!
[01:12:44] <ajpiano> i knew that it was almost definitely jquery tools' fault
[01:12:49] <Qbix1> how could his code possibly ever work if it hits that line?
[01:12:53] <ajpiano> and then i looked at which plugins they have
[01:12:59] <ajpiano> and figured which would have to do with form submitting, validator
[01:13:03] <ajpiano> then i just searched for e.target =
[01:13:04] <ajpiano> lol
[01:13:05] <Qbix1> I just don't even understand how ANY code could work
[01:13:08] <Qbix1> hehe, makes sense ajpiano :)
[01:13:10] <Qbix1> good call
[01:13:18] <Qbix1> I just don't get how ANY code could work after that line
[01:13:41] <Qbix1> do you agree that the line we have there in his submit handler (with ".V" namespace) is just 100% of the time going to cause an exception
[01:13:51] <Qbix1> because the jquery object doesn't have .nodeName
[01:14:09] <Qbix1> or rather because e.target is not supposed to be a jQuery
[01:14:29] <ajpiano> only if other code attempts to use e.target and access native dom props off it and then it turns out to be a jQuery
[01:14:36] <ajpiano> which is not necessarily the case
[01:14:51] <Qbix1> yeah I guess his own code does it, I guess jQuery didn't
[01:14:56] <ajpiano> right
[01:14:57] <Qbix1> try to access nodeNmae I mean
[01:15:03] <Qbix1> well shit.
[01:15:09] <ajpiano> so it only affects userland event handlers, for the most part
[01:15:12] <Qbix1> I am just going to have to unhook his .V namespace handlers
[01:15:20] <Qbix1> and later get rid of this retarded validator plugin
[01:15:40] <ajpiano> alright
[01:15:46] <Qbix1> he wrote this: e.target = form (which is a jquery) and then elsewhere he tries to access .nodeName on .target
[01:15:47] <ajpiano> well i have to put out my recyling and go to sleep
[01:15:49] <Qbix1> okay man thanks :)
[01:15:52] <Qbix1> you helped a lot :)
[01:15:55] <Qbix1> goodnight
[01:15:57] <ajpiano> so glad to have helped you find the direction :)
[01:15:59] <ajpiano> goodnight :)
[01:19:12] <jschwartz> hello, anyone know why location.reload(); doesnt work in Firefox?
[01:19:56] <Hooloovoo> jschwartz: try window.location = window.location;
[01:21:15] <jschwartz> Hooloovoo, that only works if I'm scrolled on the very top of the page in firefox.
[01:21:19] <Hooloovoo> also, location.reload() works for me tho.
[01:21:29] <Hooloovoo> :/
[01:21:38] <jschwartz> it is so very strange.
[01:22:05] <Hooloovoo> are you sure it's not reloading?
[01:22:20] <jschwartz> I'm sure yes
[01:23:13] <jschwartz> I am however using jQuery to trigger the event
[01:23:18] <Hooloovoo> you have a code example. when i try it there's no problem
[01:23:21] <Hooloovoo> ?
[01:23:58] <jschwartz> hmm, I'm using it in conjunction with curtain.js
[01:24:14] <jschwartz> a discontinued javascript project.
[01:24:22] <Hooloovoo> instead of location.reload()
[01:24:31] <Hooloovoo> do like console.log("OK, this is working.")
[01:24:33] <jschwartz> nope, it is a navigation script.
[01:24:35] <Hooloovoo> and see if you get that
[01:25:26] <jschwartz> it works perfectly in Chrome.
[01:25:37] <jschwartz> in IE it reloads the location.reload several times
[01:25:50] <Hooloovoo> but
[01:25:56] <Hooloovoo> try what i told you
[01:26:13] <Hooloovoo> so we know if it's the reload that doesn't work or the script that trigger the reload.
[01:26:50] <jschwartz> I get a bunch of triggers for it when i resize
[01:26:54] <Aqeel> sCoRpi_: thaNKS A TON
[01:26:54] <jschwartz> in console log
[01:27:17] <sCoRpi_> what did i do?
[01:27:25] <Aqeel> the text chaning part
[01:27:43] <Aqeel> for telling me i thought i might be having :hover issue
[01:27:47] <jschwartz> document ready -> window resize -> console log, so it is a bit wierd that it does not run the location reload aswell
[01:28:05] <Hooloovoo> it should do a reload on resize?
[01:28:11] <jschwartz> yes
[01:28:20] <Hooloovoo> ok...
[01:28:23] <Aqeel> because no matter what i do in xp firefox, it gives this strange behaviour
[01:28:53] <jschwartz> Hooloovoo, is it normal that the window resize triggers several times during one resize?
[01:29:13] <Aqeel> yes but not a good piece of work doing that
[01:29:13] <jschwartz> one drag and drop of the window size -> 4-5 lines of console log
[01:29:18] <Hooloovoo> jschwartz: yes
[01:29:21] <jschwartz> roger
[01:29:39] <Hooloovoo> doing the reload on a resize is a bad idea
[01:30:32] <Aqeel> jschwartz: jailbreak.webege.com zoom in and out with ctrl and mouse wheel..
[01:30:43] <jschwartz> Hooloovoo, yes it seems to be. but it is required to acomplish what I'm trying to do
[01:30:58] <jschwartz> I have a script that builds the navigation based on the window size
[01:31:09] <jschwartz> and it is also supposed to be responsive.
[01:31:42] <jschwartz> maybe I can modify the navigation script to utilize window resize
[01:31:45] <Hooloovoo> umm
[01:31:53] <Hooloovoo> why would you have to reload for that?
[01:32:03] <Hooloovoo> make it a javascript that just recalculate on resize
[01:32:07] <jschwartz> the navigation script is poorly built
[01:32:21] <Aqeel> then why not modify to your neds
[01:32:25] <Hooloovoo> ya
[01:32:26] <Aqeel> needs*
[01:32:34] <jschwartz> maybe you can help me with modifying the navigationscript to work with resize?
[01:32:42] <Hooloovoo> i'm all for the ugly fix that gets it to work
[01:32:53] <Hooloovoo> but in your case you should really do it a bit better
[01:33:07] <Aqeel> what is your aim
[01:33:16] <jschwartz> this is the script: https://github.com/Victa/curtain.js/
[01:33:16] <Aqeel> maybe a better plugin is out there
[01:34:05] <Aqeel> Curtain.js (The plugin is no longer maintained)
[01:34:08] <Aqeel> ??
[01:34:15] <jschwartz> exactly
[01:34:21] <jschwartz> but it is good for what it does.
[01:34:48] <jschwartz> functional but not developed firther
[01:34:52] <jschwartz> further*
[01:35:41] <Aqeel> and it uses bad binding... plugin should never be made to binded... but flexible
[01:35:57] <jschwartz> hmm
[01:36:35] <jschwartz> with all the things you told me above I might actually be on my way to a solution with taking a second look at how the script actually operates on window resize
[01:37:34] <Hooloovoo> that's good
[01:37:45] <jschwartz> it makes me happy :D
[01:40:20] <Aqeel> plugin uses alot of browser sniffing
[01:41:18] <jschwartz> Hooloovoo and Aqeel, the main problem was that the script also used window resize.
[01:42:02] <Aqeel> for all screens... mobiles, ipads, monitors and all sosrt of screens
[01:42:08] <Aqeel> sorts*
[01:43:02] <Aqeel> why don't you put plugin within your window reize code
[01:43:33] <jschwartz> Aqeel, what do you mean?
[01:44:17] <Aqeel> $(element).resize(function (){plugin code goes here})
[01:45:39] <Aqeel> make a callback for plugin after your window resize happens
[01:48:03] <jschwartz> the f.. location.reload(); still does not work in firefox :D
[01:52:47] <Aqeel> are you modifying the plugin itself or creating a function of your own and use plugin with in
[01:53:10] <jschwartz> atm I'm modifying the plugin
[01:53:14] <jschwartz> to just make it work
[02:02:43] <jschwartz> Hooloovoo, wanna see what fixed it?
[02:03:13] <jschwartz> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9605885
[02:13:35] <innociv> How do I change which drop down option is selected?
[02:13:44] <innociv> I tried changing the select selectedIndex attr.
[02:14:20] <innociv> oh, prop?  But attr returns it still.
[02:15:15] <beancurd> .val()
[02:15:15] <b-ot> beancurd, for form fields
[02:15:24] <beancurd> http://api.jquery.com/val/
[02:16:16] <beancurd> hmm. i'm guessing b-ot is a bot..
[02:16:24] <beancurd> .select()
[02:16:33] <beancurd> or not..
[02:19:52] <innociv> I got it
[02:20:06] <innociv> i needed to do .prop('selectedIndex', newIndex) and .change
[02:21:00] <beancurd> $('.selectbox').val("wantThisSelected"); will work.
[02:21:18] <beancurd> $('.selectbox').val(); will return the current selected value.
[02:22:59] <innociv> no it doesn't
[02:23:06] <innociv> it doesn't change the displayed element
[02:23:10] <innociv> oh wait it does
[02:31:35] <jammanbo> Finding deferred.then() a little confusing. Does it let me insert a callback after resolution but before done() callbacks run?
[02:31:49] <jammanbo> Like a before filter type thing
[02:36:02] <beancurd> innociv: :)
[02:53:09] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/CpDXZHtw How can I convert these to a table? :D
[02:53:20] <innociv> I need some regexp..
[02:53:26] <innociv> The breaks are at every ^ where I need a cell.
[02:53:43] <innociv> oo or i can just split
[02:54:22] <Nebros> ist that from World Of Tanks? ^^
[02:54:27] <innociv> Planetside 2
[02:54:32] <Nebros> :)
[02:54:35] <innociv> www.ps2calc.com :)
[02:54:49] <beancurd> inno. you want ^ to be a cell?
[02:54:52] <innociv> Whao is jsfiddle dead
[02:54:56] <innociv> beancurd, I got it actually
[02:55:06] <innociv> I'll put these in an array, each, and then .split()
[02:55:14] <beancurd> yeah. looks straight forward if the data is good.
[02:55:20] <innociv> yeah.
[02:56:56] <innociv> wtf is wrong with jsfiddle :(
[02:57:18] <Nebros> i have a js wich works in chome but not in ie9, but why?
[02:57:30] <Nebros> jsfiddle is lazy today
[02:57:33] <beancurd> Nebros: check the console?
[02:58:03] <Nebros> chrome have no errors and ie9, dont know. is there a console? ^^
[02:58:34] <beancurd> yeah.
[02:58:46] <beancurd> f12 i think.
[02:59:43] <Nebros> hmm there is a console... magic :P
[03:01:00] <Nebros> hmm, no error
[03:01:37] <beancurd> what doesn't work?
[03:01:48] <beancurd> eg what are you trying to do
[03:02:10] <Nebros> choose a option from form with doubleclick
[03:02:28] <reuf> hello - have a span tag: <span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff0000" id="sugesstion"></span> - which should display messages after i call $('#sugesstion').html("Thank you for your suggestion.").fadeOut(2000); - however it only works the first time i call it - on consequent calls nothing is shown - what am i doing wrong?
[03:02:59] <Nebros> hmm, i go for eat... ^^
[03:03:23] <beancurd> reuf: did you .fadeIn then call again?
[03:03:51] <beancurd> can't fadeOut again if it's already faded out..
[03:04:04] <reuf> beancurd: no i didnt
[03:04:15] <beancurd> well there you go.
[03:06:29] <beancurd> you're probably better off doing something like <span style="display:none;">thank you for your suggestion</span> then doing .toggle(), or fadein/fadeout
[03:39:50] <Nebros> re
[03:40:28] <Nebros> so, why the ie9 cant load my js but chrome can. both have no errors...
[03:41:11] <Nebros> edit: ff can do it aswell. ^^
[03:47:03] <beancurd> check your html syntax.
[03:47:13] <beancurd> ie is sensitive about tags etc.
[03:48:16] <MagmaRules> Hi there, I'm looking for a plugin that can display a list of "n" items from a larger list and then will replace one by one elements always with "n" visible. It similar to the cycle chatter in this page: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[03:50:40] <Nebros> beancurd: its not a html syntax fail and not a problem with the secure lvl
[03:51:01] <beancurd> what are you trying to do?
[03:55:55] <Nebros> http://jsfiddle.net/2CPLP/12/
[03:56:53] <Nebros> the last function want work
[03:57:01] <Nebros> the dblclick
[04:12:35] <lobbin> I have a problem with JQM that sets the total height 1px more than the viewport, hence giving me a scrollbar. padding-top, padding-bottom and min-height adds up to 1px more.
[04:17:23] <beancurd> Nebros: use $("select").dblclick() instead of ("option").dblclick

[04:18:46] <guy> anyone know of  ready made plugin for a chained survey?
[04:18:56] <guy> where further questions depend on earlier answers.
[04:18:59] <hejner> how would you go about passing "silent information" such as an ID from the autocomplete's menu of available items, to the select function?
[04:22:12] <Nebros> beancurd: it has now the same effect like before. it works on chrome, but ie9 want.
[04:22:58] <lobbin> It seems that changing 99.9% in the css ".ui-mobile, .ui-mobile body { height: 99.9%; }" to 99% seems to solve the problem. But why?
[04:23:26] <beancurd> works in ie8 for me. don't have ie9 to test.
[04:23:46] <beancurd> actually put /> on the end of input type = "submit"
[04:26:11] <Nebros> this have no effect. :(
[04:27:14] <beancurd> http://jsfiddle.net/2CPLP/16/
[04:27:25] <beancurd> ie9 works for me.
[04:28:47] <Nebros> hmm intresting, now it works also by me too. i have to see now what you have changed...
[04:33:59] <rindolf> Hi all.
[04:36:55] <martisj> anybody know of any dynamic layout plugins for jquery?
[04:41:45] <wessly> Hello, how can i set random minWidth and maxWidth (equal to Height to be a square) to div?
[04:43:32] <guy> wessly: #english
[04:44:12] <untaken_> You know with jQuery(':checkbox').change( function () { }    , I can use this.name and this.id etc.. but what exactly is this? How can I can obtain this via the name of a checkbox rather than onclick like this? I have a method which makes sure of 'this', and need to pass it the same argument. Any ideas?
[04:44:42] <untaken_> which makes use of this < that is
[04:45:24] <wessly> guy, english?
[04:45:48] <Nebros> beancurd: i have another js in the same form to filter the list, can that be the problem?
[04:46:48] <guy> wessly: it is not clear what you want. from the sound of it. var size = Math.random() * (max - min) + min; .css({minWidth: size, maxSize: size})
[04:48:40] <sCoRpi_> untaken_: can you post a fiddle with your problem? also you use a lot of "this" in your sentence ;) which "this" is which?
[04:48:44] <dwarder> does jsfiddle work?
[04:48:48] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: sure
[04:48:56] <dwarder> it is slow
[04:48:56] <sCoRpi_> dwarder: i think it works again
[04:49:00] <sCoRpi_> didn't work earlier today
[04:49:47] <dwarder> why this simple thing doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/x3rWk/
[04:50:07] <wessly> guy, im trying when the page loads divs in a container to be with random size and on random place. I tryed a lot of scripts, and no one works ;/
[04:50:34] <sCoRpi_> dwarder: because you have on ) too many
[04:51:12] <dwarder> sCoRpi_: well, still doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/6WanR/
[04:51:19] <sCoRpi_> dwarder: also it complains about not having a addYears method
[04:51:38] <lobbin> The 99.9% is there for a reason, so why is the content giving me a scrollbar?
[04:52:00] <tlvb> http://jsfiddle.net/wvsQ9/ <- I'm capturing input events of a textarea in order to resize it to fit the content, although if the user resizes the textarea manually my code stops resizing it, even though I still get the events â¦any insights?
[04:52:14] <sCoRpi_> dwarder: where did you read about an "addYears()" method?
[04:52:35] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: Its here http://jsfiddle.net/UZeDB/  Its only the JS, but as you can see, whenever someone clicks on a checkbox, it runs TickSubcategories(this) and it works fine. However, I want it to populate those checkboxes in a different way, .ie I want to call TickSubcategories() but not sure what argument to pass it.
[04:52:51] <sCoRpi_> dwarder: also, there is no method "asString()"
[04:53:12] <sCoRpi_> there is a method "toString()"
[04:53:37] <dwarder> sCoRpi_: ohh, i quess i had to include something, thanks
[04:54:10] <Nebros> wb sCoRpi_ :)
[04:54:19] <sCoRpi_> Nebros ;)
[04:54:39] <guy> wessly: You got to be f. kidding me. Don't PM people to ask questions.
[04:54:50] <Nebros> im only failing today. ^^
[04:55:00] <wessly> Ok, this is my code - http://jsfiddle.net/BREvn/
[04:55:58] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: is it clear what I am after now?
[04:56:00] <sCoRpi_> oh
[04:56:10] <sCoRpi_> untaken_: checkbox is probably just a domelement
[04:56:25] <sCoRpi_> a raw domelement
[04:56:33] <sCoRpi_> like
[04:56:47] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: do you know how I can access/obtain one of those from a form id or name?
[04:57:00] <sCoRpi_> document.getElementById('mycheckbox');
[04:57:12] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: ok...I'll give it a go
[04:57:17] <sCoRpi_> untaken_ you can also use jquery for it
[04:57:27] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: how do I do it in jquery?
[04:57:35] <sCoRpi_> if you use $('.aCheckboxClass')
[04:57:43] <sCoRpi_> it returns you a jquery collection
[04:57:53] <mindis|wurk> hmm, interesting. upgraded from jquery 1.8.1 or so to 1.8.3 and suddenly my script stopped working properly. doesn't throw errors though
[04:57:54] <sCoRpi_> if you now access that with [0] [1] etc
[04:57:59] <sCoRpi_> you get the raw domelements
[04:58:05] <sCoRpi_> let me update your fiddle
[04:59:01] <tlvb> nvm, I fixed it by disallowing resizing
[04:59:29] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: thanks
[05:02:52] <sCoRpi_> untaken_: http://jsfiddle.net/UZeDB/1/ - it doesn't do anything now, because the proper html ismissing, but you get the point
[05:03:10] <sCoRpi_> i just had those boxes in there for  testing
[05:03:45] * untaken_ takes a look...
[05:04:17] <lobbin> Removing the 99.9% height all together also solves to problem. Any ideas at all? (JQM related)
[05:13:09] <wessly> http://jsfiddle.net/BREvn/1/ - how can i make it for each div to be with unique position?
[05:13:40] <sCoRpi_> wessly: don't position them absolute?
[05:14:11] <sCoRpi_> oh
[05:14:20] <sCoRpi_> you're calculating the positions dynamically?
[05:14:21] <untaken_> sCoRpi_: Thank you. I used the method you added and adapted it slightly. Cheers!
[05:14:31] <sCoRpi_> untaken_: welcome
[05:14:37] <wessly> I dont know.
[05:14:45] <sCoRpi_> you don't know?
[05:14:46] <sCoRpi_> ..
[05:15:12] <wessly> Aaa yes dynamic.
[05:15:19] <wessly> I dont saw that.
[05:16:06] <mindis|wurk> umm...why the poop am i getting a javascript object from .outerHeight()?
[05:17:02] <wessly> sCoRpi_, i dont know in jquery what is but in php is "while" -> loop function. Here maybe is the same?
[05:18:27] <sCoRpi_> wessly: your problem is that you assign the same new value to each div, instead of computing a new one
[05:19:14] <sCoRpi_> and you also get the height from a collection, not an individual item
[05:19:26] <sCoRpi_> i'm assuming it returns the height of the first item though
[05:19:35] <wessly> Jquery must have "for each"?
[05:20:11] <sCoRpi_> wessly: yes it does, http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:20:26] <wessly> This will help me?
[05:20:32] <sCoRpi_> i don#t know, check it
[05:20:37] <sCoRpi_> you asked for "for each"
[05:21:20] <sjeijk> hi all, i have a weird IE question its ajax/jquery related so i hope some1 know about this problem
[05:21:22] <wessly> Ok i just give you a example.
[05:21:43] <sCoRpi_> wessly: i'm helping to find a solution, i will not write your final code
[05:21:56] <sjeijk> i have a form that sends get to a php script that returns db content via ajax
[05:22:14] <sjeijk> if I send it the first time, my GET vars are being send
[05:22:42] <sjeijk> if I send it the second time there are no GET variables send
[05:22:56] <sjeijk> in firefox, safari, chrome etc this works fine
[05:23:31] <sjeijk> in IE this proble occurs
[05:25:31] <juan__> sdfd
[05:25:48] <mindis|wurk> this is so goddamn strange. height() returns a number as expected but outerHeight() returns an object
[05:26:41] <juan__> como se puede realizar un chat con jquery

[05:47:19] <alaing> because my bars overlap or theres a really big space between the series
[05:48:06] <wessly> Hello http://jsfiddle.net/BREvn/2/ this is my code, but only one div element (first) move and others get him option. How can i change it to be unique for everyone div?
[05:48:11] <masentinel900> <alaing>: why the question?
[05:48:36] <granden> Cant spot whats wrong with this line.
[05:48:37] <granden> 		('tr.products:last').after('<tr><td valign=top><B>Produkt '+startval+': </B></td><td><input type="text" name="produkter[]" class="produkter" id="produkt'+startval+'" value="" style="width:200px;"></td></tr>');
[05:48:45] <alaing> masentinel900: what data are you trying to pass?
[05:48:46] <granden> I got a variable with the name startval.
[05:50:34] <alaing> granden: could you create a jsfiddle example because I honestly cant see there being anything wrong with it
[05:50:43] <granden> ok
[05:52:57] <alaing> masentinel900: do you also have a demo? Coudl you mock up something on jsfiddle as well. just looking at the API for fancybox and it looks like you need the content option to populate it
[05:53:32] <masentinel900> <alaing>: Yes
[05:53:41] <masentinel900> I going to show you my script
[05:55:18] <alaing> ok
[05:55:39] <alaing> rindolf: ???
[05:56:28] <granden> alaing: Found my problem, used an incorrect selector at another place.
[05:56:40] <rindolf> alaing: ah, no idea off hand.
[05:56:59] <alaing> lol @ granden thats usually the case. Glad you sorted

[05:57:40] <masentinel900> In HTML field is the php script!!
[06:00:44] <granden> How would I listen for keypress in a input field? And only the laste one of a certain class. And IF it got a char in it it should add a new input field.
[06:03:12] <fabioportieri> suddenly i have this error inside colorbox.js TypeError: $.browser is undefined  ??
[06:03:19] <PY1NB1> folks, my script do not revert checkbox from checked to unchecked and then back to checked: $('input:checkbox').attr('checked', false);$('input:checkbox').attr('checked', true);
[06:03:26] <PY1NB1> any idea about it?
[06:03:46] <alaing> fabioportieri: upgraded recently?
[06:04:05] <tlkr> granden, $('.class:last-child').on('keypress', function(event) {});
[06:04:35] <granden> .on is "new" .live so it would listen on the new last child if the class .class?
[06:04:35] <b-ot> granden, memorised âonâ.
[06:04:41] <alaing> fabioportieri: sounds like something might be clashing for $.
[06:04:55] <tlkr> PY1NB1, try .removeAttr('checked');
[06:05:11] <Sonderblade> let's say you are setting an elements background color using $(this).css("background-color", "#fffff0"), is there then any way to reset it to what it was previously?
[06:05:27] <lobbin> Ok, turns out my problem was related to the default browser body margin, not anything else. :)
[06:05:41] <granden> tlkr: Missed to mention you on my last line.
[06:05:51] <alaing> Sonderblade: best way to use css class and use add/remove class.
[06:05:52] <tlkr> granden, use $('parent').on('keypress', '.class:last-child', function(event) {});
[06:06:06] <tlkr> where parent is not dynamically created
[06:06:16] <PY1NB1> tlkr: thanks, but it doesnt work
[06:06:20] <alaing> Sonderblade: you could use .removeAttr('style') if you dont have any other inline style attributes on the element
[06:06:20] <tlkr> live is deprecated and should be avoided
[06:06:20] <Sonderblade> alaing: good idea! i didnt think of that
[06:06:53] <PY1NB1> tlkr: it works to deselect, but when I run .attr(Â´selectedÂ´, true) it doesnt select back
[06:06:56] <granden> tlkr: Ok thanks, whats the differenc between :last-child and :last?
[06:08:07] <tlkr> PY1NB1, i thought you were manipulating a checkbox? selected will not work on a checkbox.
[06:08:32] <PY1NB1> tlkr: sorry, mistype, $('input:checkbox').attr('checked', true)
[06:09:47] <tlkr> granden, http://api.jquery.com/last-child-selector/ read this
[06:11:42] <fabioportieri> alaing weird thing is it was fine yesterday :|
[06:12:08] <granden> tlkr: But hmm, but its not the last child of the parent I'm listening on.
[06:12:47] <granden> I got more like <table ><tr><td><input></td></tr><tr><td><input></td></tr> </table>
[06:12:51] <alaing> fabioportieri: how are you linking to jQuery library? Are you using a local copy or one thats stored on your server i.e not a google/cdn linked one.
[06:13:09] <tlkr> granden, which is why you use .class:last-child, which matches the last child of that class
[06:13:11] <granden> tlkr: Want to listen on the last input with a certain class in the table.
[06:13:15] <granden> ah
[06:13:29] <granden> sorry then. Thought It would have to be of the $('parent')
[06:13:32] <tlkr> ?p PY1NB1
[06:13:32] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:13:36] <fabioportieri> alaing: the one from "http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"
[06:15:47] <alaing> fabioportieri: and your colorbox?
[06:15:59] <fabioportieri> from a local copy
[06:17:15] <alaing> fabioportieri: i know its recommended not to use $.browser. Could you post up your html on jsfiddle?
[06:17:27] <alaing> or do you have a live site I coudl access?
[06:18:25] <fabioportieri> alaing: it's weird because that is the actual plugin file, not mine
[06:18:59] <alaing> are you using another jquery version or another library as well?
[06:19:16] <alaing> what browser are you using?
[06:19:45] <fabioportieri> firefox, but with others browser doesn't work too
[06:20:01] <alaing> sounds about right
[06:24:59] <PY1NB1> tlkr: http://jsfiddle.net/bsJr4/
[06:32:31] <fabioportieri> alaing: any suggestion to solve that?
[06:33:08] <alaing> do you have a live site I could try or coudl you put up a demo on jsfiddle.
[06:33:25] <alaing> have you done any changes today?
[06:34:09] * hlve slaps alaing around a bit with a large trout
[06:35:54] <alaing> oi!!! lol
[06:36:11] <retro|cz> Hello
[06:37:00] <retro|cz> What jquery should I use with jquery 1.8.3?
[06:37:26] <imacinto> as much as you need!
[06:37:31] <imacinto> but no more
[06:37:46] <retro|cz> I'm using UI 1.9.2 and I'm getting error on this line - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-9-stable/ui/jquery.ui.slider.js#L119
[06:37:51] <retro|cz> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method '_on'
[06:39:41] <fabioportieri> alaing: yes some little changes here and there but i can't backtrack them
[06:41:10] <imacinto> retro|cz: I'm a little confused, are you saying that you're using UI 1.9.2 with jQuery 1.8.3 and without even using any functionality you get that error?
[06:41:28] <retro|cz> imacinto, nope, I'm using datetimepicker addon.
[06:41:40] <retro|cz> https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon
[06:43:46] <imacinto> retro|cz: oh, I see. I'm not familiar with that plug-in, but can almost guarantee that it's where the issue lies. jQuery UI 1.9.2 reports being compatible with jQuery 1.6+
[06:45:16] <PY1NB1> tlkr
[06:45:43] <tlkr> I can't see what's wrong with it PY1NB1, I will have a look later if I have time
[06:46:04] <PY1NB1> on chrome, that on jsfiddle doesnt work. thanks
[06:46:06] <retro|cz> imacinto, everything worked few days ago. Maybe jquery or jqueryui was updated.
[06:47:30] <iaj> where should I look when I want to add an <a>...</a> tag before a certain class?
[06:48:08] <retro|cz> imacinto, I'm using datepicker from UI with datetimepicker addon.
[06:48:49] <imacinto> retro|cz: so the only three scripts you're using are jQuery, jQuery UI, and that datetimepicker thing? And you're calling jQuery and jQuery UI from CDN, so you're thinking maybe one of those was updated?
[06:49:16] <retro|cz> imacinto, no, I have jquery bundle, but it can update when I'm updating dependencies.
[06:51:00] <shoky> iaj: .before() or  .insertBefore()
[06:52:03] <iaj> shoky: thanks :)
[06:52:12] <hlve> Shoky, why you so smart
[06:52:19] * hlve gives shoky a cookie
[06:52:49] <imacinto> retro|cz: not sure what you mean when you say jQuery bundle... what's in the bundle?
[06:52:51] <shoky> nomnomnom
[06:52:58] <retro|cz> imacinto, clean jquery
[06:53:29] <retro|cz> imacinto, https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails/blob/v2.1.4/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery.js
[06:53:39] <hlve> "jquery bundle"? o_o
[06:53:46] <hlve> i'm lawst
[06:55:11] <retro|cz> jquery bundled into gem
[06:55:31] <blackspotwiggins> retro|cz, are you sure that the timepicker plugin is supported on jqui 1.9 ?
[06:58:05] <imacinto> retro|cz: I guess what I'm saying is that I would try to eliminate as many variables as possible to try and isolate the problem. I would start by referring directly to CDN versions of these plugins to make sure nothing with them is corrupt. if these three things were working together just fine a few days ago, then obviously something must have changed. I'd start with the easiest thing first,
[06:58:05] <imacinto> so pull a known good version of jQuery in, then a known good version of jQuery UI, then a known good version of datetimepicker
[06:58:34] <retro|cz> imacinto, I'm downgrading UI now.
[06:59:05] <retro|cz> imacinto, yup. I'm using 1.8 UI and it works.
[06:59:10] <retro|cz> imacinto, thanks
[06:59:24] <imacinto> retro|cz: happy (and amazed) I could help
[06:59:48] <fabioportieri> the new jquery is out? my site is messed up now
[07:00:49] <czytacz> hi, is there any way to display flip effect other than Flip! plugin? http://lab.smashup.it/flip/
[07:02:20] <czytacz> what I need to achieve is to change subpages with this effect. (a grid of 4x3 squares) I wonder if this one is the most efficient
[07:02:44] <blackspotwiggins> retro|cz, you can use the jquery-rails bundle, just dont add the bundled ui js, use the older one instead
[07:02:54] <blackspotwiggins> you prolly want to make a custom build anyway to save on size
[07:03:05] <retro|cz> blackspotwiggins, yup. I locked jquery-ui-rails to ~> 2.0.0
[07:03:34] <blackspotwiggins> ah it's a separate gem now
[07:05:13] <Wolf_22> When using .each() to iterate through some divs on a page, is there a way to use indexing within .each() to do something like "$('div'+[key])" ? (Essentially indicating an "nth" div in whatever logic?)
[07:05:37] <Nebros> sCoRpi_ there? :)
[07:05:38] <retro|cz> blackspotwiggins, some basic jquery-ui is inseide jquery-rails. But jquery-ui-rails contains whole jquery-ui.
[07:05:43] <retro|cz> inside
[07:06:30] <tlkr> Wolf_22, you can do .each(function(index element)) if that's what you mean
[07:07:54] <Wolf_22> tlkr: Ah, okay. But how do I use that reference to do something against the div?
[07:08:23] <tlkr> Wolf_22, $(element).func() ?
[07:08:41] <Wolf_22> tlkr: Gotchya. Thanks!
[07:08:48] <tlkr> No problem
[07:13:38] <andrewSC> hi all
[07:14:55] <andrewSC> I'm trying to implement some sort of page caching with jQuery where if I modify the DOM then go to an external link (next page, perhaps) then click the browser's back button, the previous page is loaded with the modified DOM.  What is the technical name of this behavior and what is it called in jQuery?
[07:18:24] <iman> are there any function to convert html form to json such as this form, {"name":"value", ...}
[07:19:14] <Haprog> iman: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:19:56] <alaing> hi anyone here user jquery flot plugin?
[07:21:37] <Nebros> if the next page in ie9 have to load, only on top is a small symbol, that show it is loading. is there a function that the user better can see, it is working...?
[07:28:48] <shoky> $('<div class="CENTER_BIG"> LOADING ! ! ! </div>').appendTo('body')
[07:30:53] <grafi> hm
[07:31:04] <grafi> prependTo?
[07:31:24] <shoky> .CENTER_BIG would have z-index: 999999, of course
[07:31:32] <shoky> and position:fixed
[07:31:33] <shoky> etc.
[07:31:47] <shoky> just as long as you don't take me seriously
[07:31:54] <grafi> that'll do
[07:35:18] <Whirl3d> Mornin' all. I have been looking through the jquery UI styles and can't seem to find a "draggable-n-s" or something equivalent, any ideas?
[07:35:34] <shoky> mornin'
[07:35:40] <shoky> draggable-n-s ?
[07:35:51] <Whirl3d> like resizable-n-w for example
[07:36:06] <shoky> what's n-s?
[07:36:13] <Whirl3d> north south
[07:36:34] <shoky> uhm
[07:36:36] <Whirl3d> like arrows-thick-2-n-s
[07:36:57] <Whirl3d> sry arrowthick-2-n-s
[07:39:17] <Whirl3d> in general ui design, which is preferred, the close icon on the left or the right?
[07:42:05] <dziegler> hi, is it possible to draw a pi chart with jqplot with an transparent background?
[07:42:28] <Nebros> shoky, where i have to bound this in? ^^
[07:43:40] <imacinto> Whirl3d: anecdotally, the first place I always look in the top right corner
[07:44:02] <imacinto> *is
[07:44:27] <Whirl3d> imacinto, thanks for the input
[07:46:42] <shoky> Nebros: i was mostly kidding... my way of telling you that you can just put a loading message somewhere if you want.. while loading whhatever it is you're loading
[07:47:22] <shoky> Whirl3d: ohh i was thinking resizable-n-s didnt know wtf you want
[07:48:52] <Nebros> i cant see any loading text or something. :(
[07:49:55] <shoky> huh?
[07:51:42] <Nebros> i have tried now 3 versions to show the users, the page is loading... ok  alert("Please wait, it's loading..."); was the bades idea i had. xD
[07:51:43] <shoky> Whirl3d: actually still no idea what you mean/want
[07:55:01] <geekie> Hi! I'm having an issue with cloning draggable and resizable div, I wrote down what the issue is here:
[07:55:04] <geekie> http://pastie.org/5688866
[07:55:05] <geekie> Does anyone have a clue?
[07:57:23] <shoky> geekie: don't clone it.. just store the original position
[07:58:15] <geekie> shoky: they can change more than just position tho, content colours everything
[07:58:35] <geekie> so then to store all of that for a reset button, cloning seemed like the easier solution
[07:58:59] <shoky> geekie: and if you're gonna clone, then don't clone stuff with jquery-ui stuff on it
[07:59:35] <geekie> hmmm I was thinking destroying the juqery-ui stuff and reattaching them to the new clone would be the solution?
[08:00:21] <shoky> that could also work. i just don't see the need for cloning
[08:01:38] <geekie> Maybe I am thinking wrong, the need for cloning is that there's so many stuff that change (and also new stuff can be added in future)
[08:01:56] <geekie> if I clone the event it means I don't have to keep all these things in account and the functionality should theoratically still work
[08:02:02] <geekie> erm clone the div
[08:02:27] <geekie> Each div you can change have different properties like colours, texts, pictures
[08:03:03] <geekie> Keeping track of everything a user changes (saving all original state) seemed easier to do by just saving the original div.
[08:03:33] <shoky> oks try destroying then
[08:04:02] <geekie> :)
[08:07:47] <enderx86> If I have called $('#myTable').jqGrid({...}) in the local scope of File1.js, can I access that same jqGrid by calling $('#myTable').jqGrid() in File2.js, or will this create a new jqGrid object?
[08:10:44] <shoky> enderx86: it'll probably try to create a new one (or do nothing maybe), i'm sure jqGrid docs have a way for you to access it
[08:14:30] <shoky> enderx86: tho looking at their site, seems they just have many "methods" for you to call e.g. .jqGrid('getGridParam', 'sortorder')
[08:14:47] <enderx86> shoky: What would you recommend here? Having each grid be a global object?
[08:15:20] <shoky> enderx86: i don't really use jqGrid, but, what object are you talking about
[08:15:34] <enderx86> What I'm trying to do is get HighCharts to interact with jqGrid. So, when HighCharts registers an event, I can update my jqGrid. But I want the two to be in separate JS files.
[08:16:15] <enderx86> So, my chart.js file needs references to the jqGrid, or a way to obtain references.
[08:17:03] <shoky> can't really help you with how to organize it as im not familiar at all with either of those plugins ;p
[08:25:56] <jedimind> http://notes.xoxco.com/post/36766728425/aware-js-make-your-site-reader-aware
[08:26:18] <geekie> I solved it! Thanks for helping me think shoky ;D
[08:33:46] <Danny> Hi! I have some trouble with outerWidth(). this function return 22.5px. it doesn't matter if more or less text is inside the element
[08:50:56] <Whirl3d> I still have a lot of work to do on this, but wondered how I should handle the blur/focus events. I guess blur fires first, so when I shrink my field (if empty) it fires the focus event on the wrong element: http://jsfiddle.net/P4kwn/
[08:51:32] <Whirl3d> click on label, delete it's contents and then click on quote for example.
[08:51:58] <`RobW> does anyone knwo of a firebug plugin that can spit out the computed style of an element?
[08:52:03] <`RobW> so i can copy/paste into a css file.. for example
[08:52:17] <`RobW> for example.. an element that inherits from base.css and skeleton.css and main.css... I want the final styles
[08:52:24] <`RobW> Curious if anyone know if such a plugin exists :)
[08:52:26] <jberg> `RobW: doesn't Firebug do that by default?
[08:52:44] <`RobW> jberg: firebug shows them, yes, but I want a compiled list... not a list-per-css-file list
[08:52:45] <jberg> it shows it as "element.style"
[08:52:52] <`RobW> jberg: no
[08:52:58] <`RobW> element.style is inline styles
[08:53:07] <jberg> yea
[08:53:09] <jberg> true
[08:53:23] <jberg> misunderstood your question
[08:53:30] <`RobW> frustrating because i can see all the styles.. and even sometimes firebug doesn't show all inherited styles >_<
[08:53:50] <`RobW> and it crosses out overridden styles -- but sometimes doesn't show the replacement value
[08:54:08] <greg5green`> idk about Firebug, but the Inspector in chrome will let you select and then copy all computed styles
[08:54:14] <greg5green`> or all computed styles + inherited styles
[08:54:21] <tlkr> `RobW, click the dropdown next to Style on firebug and tick  Only show applied styles
[08:54:24] <czytacz> I have 4 elements of the same class. Is there a way to put an effect on them that would start working with some delay for some of them so that the animation will fieel more natural??
[08:54:26] <tlkr> you can then copy and paste the applie css
[09:00:16] <Taggnostr> I want to select all the <input>s with class .email and .url, and then select all the other inputs.  I used $("input.url, input.email") for the first case, how do I get the opposite?
[09:01:44] <Taggnostr> $("input:not(.url, .email)")?
[09:02:31] <tlkr> try it and see
[09:03:05] <shoky> czytacz you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nbNwS/
[09:03:45] <czytacz> shoky: yeah, thaks :D
[09:05:17] <Whirl3d> shoky you showoff.
[09:05:23] <Whirl3d> That's nice
[09:05:43] <shoky> ;]
[09:05:53] <Whirl3d> now can you do it with just css?
[09:05:55] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:06:14] <shoky> prolly ;p
[09:07:02] <`RobW> tlkr: I don't think that works the same though
[09:08:37] <`RobW> hm.. might.. but would take a really long time for multiple elemnts if i have to do this manually
[09:08:40] <`RobW> ugh
[09:14:49] <`RobW> ok so chrome does this somewhat
[09:14:58] <`RobW> but it shows a ton of -webkit properties
[09:15:02] <`RobW> which won't apply.. hm
[09:16:08] <Ravindran> Taggnostr: you can cache '$("input.url, input.email")' to some variables, say $selInput and then you can use $('input').not($selInput) . This shd be faster than css :not selector.
[09:17:28] <Taggnostr> Ravindran, thanks for the suggestion
[09:26:07] <Whirl3d> I have a span element that I want to capture click events on and inside it i have an anchor element (and some other stuff). How can I tell if the anchor element was clicked and not the other stuff?
[09:26:22] <happyface> 1.9 BOYS
[09:26:42] <Whirl3d> nvm
[09:36:49] <robinsmidsrod> does anyone use the dataTables jquery plugin? I'm having trouble getting a table row recognized after dynamically adding it to the DOM (of the table) - has anyone done it before? I hope so
[09:37:12] <Whirl3d> How do you focus a textarea element so that it's contents are selected?
[09:37:24] <MistuhKurtz> $('textarea').focus();
[09:38:20] <MistuhKurtz> er
[09:38:28] <MistuhKurtz> Whirl3d, $('textarea').select(); i think
[09:38:31] <MistuhKurtz> ?select @ Whirl3d
[09:39:14] <MistuhKurtz> just for the love of god, don't do it on the textarea focus() event, do it on a button press or something
[09:39:24] <iman> what is different between $(function(){}); and $(document).ready(function() {}); ?
[09:39:26] <MistuhKurtz> I hate it when I only want to select a part of the string =\
[09:39:31] <iman> i think there are same
[09:39:32] <MistuhKurtz> iman, same thing
[09:39:39] <iman> thanks
[09:47:17] <dlam> hmm is there some hack code i can put in to prevent a $(document).ready(...)  from happening?
[09:47:25] <Whirl3d> MistuhKurtz, select() doesn't work.
[09:47:49] <Whirl3d> my bad, I did it in the wrong place.
[09:48:48] <Whirl3d> I use check the textarea for default value and select all if is

[10:05:24] <rindolf> supsup: and been working on http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/ - it involves a lot of jQuery. :-)

[10:08:23] <f0ster> how can I select something inside of an iframe ? tried jQuery('#somethinginmyiframe', jQuery('#myiframe')), but it didnt work
[10:08:55] <NodeX> contents()
[10:09:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I'm adding content on the fly inside a jquery accordion section, I need the section to refresh after adding the content... is that possible?
[10:09:45] <f0ster> ty NodeX
[10:12:17] <needinghelp> Somebody please have a quick look at this http://paste2.org/p/2752587
[10:13:06] <needinghelp> it used to send mysql column "pageid" data to a hidden text input named "mysqlid" now it doesnt
[10:18:14] <supsup> seems like line 11 is bogus have do u have a .data out of thin air?
[10:18:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experienced with JQUERY accordion?
[10:21:17] <supsup> rindolf: nice.
[10:21:38] <rindolf> ecky--ptang-zoob: the jQueryUI one?
[10:25:56] <DocBrown> Can anyone think of a reason why I would get a too much recursion error from a selector with a long ID in sharepoint?
[10:25:57] <supsup> rindolf: he might be talking about some perfect accordion all plato like
[10:26:01] <DocBrown> works fine in JS fiddle
[10:26:04] <DocBrown> just not sharepoint
[10:26:22] <supsup> afk lunch
[10:27:06] <DocBrown> crap.. I bet the error is being thrown by sharepoint, not jQuery
[10:34:15] <JFranks> Why is it that when I want a jQuery button to be only 30px height, the text sits at the bottom? http://jsfiddle.net/L6wfN/
[10:41:57] <Jon47> JFranks: i dno't know jquery UI but the button on your page is designed to be a certain height, you can't just change the height of the parent element and expect the rest of the styles to automatically adapt
[10:43:05] <hlve> lol
[10:43:45] <sunbeam> Is it possible to add target="_blank" to all <a>'s of a certain class?
[10:44:29] <JFranks> Jon47: I think the right answer is to tell jQueryui to set the button height.. I think my manual intervention is the issue. ;)
[10:45:18] <Jon47> word
[10:49:49] <`RobW> sunbeam: why.. use rel="external" in anchor tags.. then... $("a[rel=external]").attr("target", "_blank")
[10:49:56] <`RobW> then it passes validation ftw

[10:54:32] <Absolute0> How can I get the top, left values of a rotated div, where top and left still point to the original top and left values?
[10:55:26] <`RobW> Absolute0: probably store them before rotating the div
[10:55:34] <`RobW> otherwise, you can't.
[10:55:48] <Absolute0> `RobW: but that div is also draggable
[10:56:18] <Absolute0> `RobW: I guess that would also need to take care of updates.
[10:59:20] <`RobW> ParanoidGal: probably need to modify the source.. such as bullets.hover(function()
[10:59:43] <Absolute0> `RobW: Probably, you should stop saying probably. :D
[11:04:38] <masentinel900> Helllo everybody
[11:04:41] <masentinel900> ll
[11:05:13] <masentinel900> Really I'm working with ajax jquery, al goes ok..
[11:06:16] <masentinel900> I'm doing a $.post for pass some data from the view to controller.
[11:06:38] <masentinel900> Now I want to show the new window but with Fancybox, And here is the problem.
[11:07:11] <`RobW> Absolute0: having a user being uncertain about a probability is an enjoyment
[11:07:15] <mixandgo> what does this mean: e.fn.e.init[0]
[11:07:17] <`RobW> makes you think :)
[11:07:52] <masentinel900> read the new data of controller but don't pass the data from the view
[11:08:34] <`RobW> mixandgo: it's returning index 0 of array init
[11:08:35] <`RobW> ?
[11:08:58] <mixandgo> `RobW: that's the return of $("#someid")
[11:09:16] <mixandgo> not sure why it's got that form
[11:09:38] <Absolute0> mixandgo: "probably" best to leave it alone
[11:09:43] <Absolute0> it's internal jquery stuff
[11:10:22] <mixandgo> Absolute0: but I need to use it like a jQuery obj... and calling .addClass on it (for example) doesn't do anything
[11:10:35] <`RobW> how is that the return of $("#someid").. the return of $("#someid") should be an element DOM object, if it exists, or false
[11:10:37] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/5k5nu/
[11:10:37] <smill> hi, i'm having a weird problem.  i loaded jquery into my page, then loaded my script, all its doing is  one css change to one element, but it doesn't run.  if i put an alert in the script it alerts, but it doesn't change the css.  if i type the same code into the chrome console, it runs and changes the element's css, what am i doing wrong?
[11:10:41] <`RobW> you must be calling a function on that element.
[11:10:42] <Absolute0> $('some_select').addClass
[11:10:45] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/5k5nu/
[11:10:52] <masentinel900> There is my script
[11:11:00] <danheberden> `RobW: the return of $() is a jQuery object
[11:11:04] <Absolute0> mixandgo: ^^
[11:11:16] <mixandgo> Absolute0: I am storing that in an obj attribute, and I need to retrieve it at some point
[11:11:25] <danheberden> its constructor is jQuery.fn.init
[11:11:25] <Absolute0> mixandgo: can you show some code?
[11:11:34] <mixandgo> Absolute0: gimme a sec
[11:11:42] <Absolute0> var x = $(...); x.addClass() ?
[11:12:03] <danheberden> so $('#whatever') returns a new jQ object with a prototype of all the methods you know and love
[11:12:13] <danheberden> and the elements that were found as array indices
[11:12:20] <danheberden> [0] == #whatever, in that case
[11:13:31] <mixandgo> Absolute0: something like this https://gist.github.com/f9123071486d0ccdf0a5
[11:13:47] <`RobW> masentinel900: can you post an example json_encoded string instead
[11:14:05] <Absolute0> mixandgo: did you mean "this" on line 5?
[11:14:12] <mixandgo> yes, sorry
[11:15:32] <smill> all I am running in my script is $("#login").css("background-color","#333"); to test it and its not changing it, but if i type it in the console it runs, wth
[11:15:40] <masentinel900> <`RobW>: I don't understand what tell me?
[11:15:47] <masentinel900> tell me again please
[11:15:54] <Absolute0> mixandgo: http://jsfiddle.net/UbLUa/
[11:16:14] <Absolute0> maybe you just had a typo? I don't understand what's your problem.
[11:16:30] <`RobW> masentinel900: provide me an example output of: 	echo json_encode($data . "Diego");
[11:16:50] <mixandgo> Absolute0: ok, thanks I will try to figure out whats going on
[11:17:26] <`RobW> masentinel900: also, fancybox() you can trigger with .show()
[11:17:30] <Absolute0> is ui.originalPosition standard for jquery.draggable(drag function(event, ui){}) ?
[11:17:33] <Absolute0> it's not in the docs
[11:17:35] <`RobW> $.fancybox({ options }).show()
[11:17:37] <masentinel900> such as like I have now, In the fancybox window just show me "Diego"
[11:18:43] <`RobW> masentinel900: I think you're using the wrong properties.. if you're using fancybox2, see: http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#docs
[11:19:06] <`RobW> masentinel900: there's ajax examples in the download
[11:22:25] <mg983> hi guys
[11:23:32] <mg983> Any isotope people here?
[11:23:47] <mg983> I am using infiniteScroll with isotope and wanted to know if I could wrap each new "page" in a separate div
[11:23:50] <mg983> I can't seem to figure this out
[11:25:58] <`RobW> mg983: I thought you had to use one master "wrapper" ?
[11:26:06] <mg983> i have one master wrapper
[11:26:39] <mg983> i have <div id="master"><article>...</article><article>...</article><article>...</article><article>...</article><article>...</article><article>...</article></div>
[11:26:40] <mg983> I want
[11:27:01] <mg983> i have <div id="master"><div class="page"><article>...</article><article>...</article><article>...</article></div><div class="page"><article>...</article><article>...</article><article>...</article></div></div>
[11:29:05] <hackeron> haha http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yZHbh396rc
[11:32:00] <wessly> Hello how can i do exact word match with this code - http://jsfiddle.net/HcQKG/ ?
[11:32:18] <nabr0_> mg983: is wrapping a div around the content that's bring brought in via AJAX not an option?
[11:32:37] <mg983> anything is an option
[11:34:52] <nabr0_> mg983: the docs for isotope say that appended method triggers addItems and the example shows where addItems get's it's data http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/adding-items.html
[11:35:37] <nabr0_> you'd have something like this: $container.isotope( 'appended', $( newElements ) ); and what you're pushing into $( newElements) is what you'd want to wrap in a div
[11:36:01] <nabr0_> (i've never used isotope, just reading their docs)
[11:36:16] <mg983> nabr0_: yeah how would I do that?
[11:36:21] <mg983> This is what I am doing
[11:36:52] <mg983> $('body.home #main, body.author #main').isotope( 'appended', $( newElements ));
[11:38:33] <MacDada> Hi, if I have two submit callbacks to a form, can I be sure that BOTH are gonna be fired before form is submitted? $form.submit(callback1); /* somewhere elseâ¦ */ $form.submit(callback2)
[11:39:17] <nabr0_> mg983: can you use wrap()? $('body.home irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#main, body.author irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#main').isotope( 'appended', $( newElements ).wrap('<div class="page" />');  ?
[11:39:29] <mg983> I treid that
[11:39:36] <mg983> $(newElements) is an object
[11:39:39] <mg983> not a string...
[11:39:39] <`RobW> dafaq
[11:40:03] <nabr0_> that output was odd
[11:40:16] <`RobW> MacDada:  you don't. you do whatever it is you're doing in one callback
[11:40:36] <`RobW> or, in callback1 - return the value of callback2
[11:40:51] <`RobW> assuming callback1 is true - return callback2()
[11:40:56] <nabr0_> mg983: where's the data coming from that's going into $(newElements)?
[11:41:02] <czytacz> could anyone please translate me this line into plain english?
[11:41:06] <czytacz> elem.html(elem.siblings('.sponsorData').html());
[11:41:36] <czytacz> elem is a variable assigned for specific div
[11:41:40] <`RobW> czytacz: it updates the html in var 'elem' with the siblings (elements near 'elem') with the class of "sponsorData"
[11:42:14] <mg983> nabr0_: http://pastebin.com/kHEVeF9w
[11:42:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm trying to get the index of the active accordion element, but it gives back an [object object]  - $("#folders_68").accordion('option', 'active');
[11:42:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why does that not work?
[11:42:23] <`RobW> <div id='wrapper">  <div class="foo">asdf</div> <div class="elem"></div> <div class="bar">bar</div> <div class="sponsorData">Some sponsor data</div>  </div>    -- say 'elem' = $(".elem")
[11:42:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $(".folders").accordion('option', 'active'); - that does give back an index number - but it should work with an ID selector...
[11:43:40] <MacDada> RobW: well, callback1 is really an anonymous function that I cannot modify. I want to add my own functionality that should be fired before the form is submitted. Any suggestions?
[11:43:48] <nabr0_> mg983: you're missing a closing ) at the end of line 14
[11:44:00] <mg983> nabr0_: it's there I messed up C&P
[11:45:02] <czytacz> `RobW: so all divs in Your example should have "sponsorData" class added to their current classes, yes?
[11:45:27] <`RobW> MacDada: can you post example
[11:45:38] <MacDada> `RobW: yes, sec
[11:45:41] <mg983> nabr0_: what that does is wrap EVERY single <article> in a separate <div>
[11:45:47] <`RobW> czytacz: basicaly, .sponsorData is a sibling, because it's in the same parent
[11:45:52] <`RobW> parent = #wrapper
[11:45:58] <`RobW> all divs in #wrapper are siblings
[11:46:28] <czytacz> okay, i think i got it
[11:46:31] <czytacz> thanks
[11:46:39] <`RobW> np.. there's also next() and prev() :)
[11:46:41] <`RobW> have fun
[11:47:36] <nabr0_> mg983: .isotope also accepts a callback, perhaps a function that looks for newly added divs and wraps them?
[11:47:49] <guybrushsantiago> Need an FTP browsing widget to attach to an input field. Any ideas?
[11:47:57] <mg983> How would I do that though?
[11:48:36] <MacDada> `RobW: https://gist.github.com/4541415
[11:56:10] <mg983> nabr0_:  any idea?
[11:58:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone?..
[11:59:46] <someish> I'm getting a "identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" on this: https://gist.github.com/4331143f923a81af11c9 what's wrong with it?
[12:01:33] <grafi>  margin: 50px 0,
[12:01:43] <grafi> should probably be a string
[12:02:38] <someish> grafi, whether or not I put the property values in single or double quotes makes no difference. I still get the error.
[12:02:59] <`RobW> sec
[12:04:11] <kapowaz> is anyone familiar with the changeData event not firing for any reason?
[12:04:44] <grafi> well I get the exact same error you get until I do margin '50px 0',
[12:04:49] <grafi> after that it works
[12:06:27] <scar> what is the besst way to determine if an email is a valid email using jquery? by valid, i mean as little as just structure.
[12:06:59] <happyface> scar, regex
[12:07:13] <scar> k. didnt know if there was a function or not :d
[12:07:13] <`RobW> MacDada: i see.. you should be able to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/pPSpn/ -- however, you'll have an iddue knowing if callback 1 was successful without some sort of global var to check
[12:07:21] <scar> like php has filter_var() for vali email
[12:07:50] <scar> do i use on click for selecting INSIDE a text box, or is there a different state?
[12:07:56] <`RobW> MacDada: example of such: http://jsfiddle.net/pPSpn/1/
[12:08:21] <`RobW> scar: google it.. there's tons of email validation ones, from simple to RFC-specific
[12:08:29] <`RobW> easiest is to check position of @ and .
[12:08:31] <happyface> scar, blur event? I'm not sure what you mean
[12:08:38] <nabr0_> mg983: any chance you can try moving .wrap outside of isotope? .isotope( 'appended', $( newElements)).wrap("<div class='abcdefg' />")
[12:08:46] <nabr0_> after that i'm not sure, sorry
[12:08:57] <happyface> scar, http://stackoverflow.com/a/2855946/403844
[12:09:06] <mg983> ok thanks
[12:09:07] <mg983> tried that
[12:10:06] <MacDada> `RobW: I dont care about my callback2 being fired if the form is not to be submitted (eg callback1 returned false), so thanks for answering!
[12:11:01] <`RobW> MacDada: np.. just remember, order of operations for callbacks apply.. whichever is bound first gets called first
[12:12:47] <MacDada> `RobW: yeah, doesnt make difference to me either â the lib is doing some validation stuff and I want to additional input type hidden. Just need to be sure that it is always going to be added before submitting ;)
[12:13:36] <`RobW> fun fun as long as callback1 doesn't break js, you're good to go :)
[12:14:23] <JD-Robbs> Does anyone know whether I can tell raty to use a specific hidden field to store the value in? It seems to me it only works with it's own, auto-generated, input. Thank you! :-)
[12:15:55] <`RobW> wth is raty
[12:16:15] <JD-Robbs> jQuery Raty plugin. For star-style ratings
[12:16:39] <JD-Robbs> `RobW: http://wbotelhos.com/raty/
[12:17:11] <JD-Robbs> Oh damn, just seen it's got an event I can use.
[12:17:27] <`RobW> :D
[12:17:37] <mats_> hi http://jsfiddle.net/7nVC4/ <- this works fine for me if there's only one item with the class sliderhead, if more - no no won't work. what am i doing wrong here?
[12:17:39] <JD-Robbs> Ha, cheers anyway (for caring) ;-)
[12:19:26] <`RobW> mats_: iterate through it instead
[12:20:15] <`RobW> mats_: : example: http://jsfiddle.net/7nVC4/1/
[12:20:23] <gx_> I'm debugging a script that uses jquery datables, and in IE8 only, I get "object doesnt support this property or method" and it references this code: var c = s.charCodeAt( s.length-1 ); (within datatables.js). Anyone have any idea how to fix this or what might be the problem?
[12:20:43] <`RobW> gx_: the issue lies outside of datatables. check your html
[12:21:14] <mats_> `RobW: ooh, is each is a loop?
[12:21:35] <mats_> one is less there would've been better :)
[12:22:26] <`RobW> mats_: yes - since you're dealing with a class selector
[12:22:31] <`RobW> there can be more than one match
[12:22:48] <`RobW> which is the issue you're running into. you can't set the height() of an array
[12:22:56] <`RobW> err, i mean
[12:22:59] <`RobW> you can't check the height() of an array
[12:24:05] <gx_> `RobW shot in the dark, but any experience with datatables? i'm at a loss at how to fix this. works fine in every other browser
[12:24:13] <mats_> `RobW: i need the font size to be smaller if the the h3 tag is too long. better find another way then :)
[12:26:28] <fakingfantastic> hey gang. If I have a function foo() { $(this).hide() } â¦ how do I call that function so that $("#some-div") == this?
[12:27:03] <`RobW> fakingfantastic: pass it in an argument
[12:27:11] <NoiseEee> fakingfantastic: you don't, you rewrite the function
[12:27:25] <`RobW> gx_: its 95% an html issue
[12:27:29] <knguyen> hi... how do i select a div that contains a class?
[12:27:37] <`RobW> $("div.class")
[12:27:38] <gx_> `RobW html? or js?
[12:27:41] <NoiseEee> fakingfantastic:   function foo(theID) { $('#'+theID).hide() }
[12:27:54] <fakingfantastic> `RobW: yeah, i know â¦ but this is pre-existing code. They are using it with hoverIntent so like $("#foo").hoverIntent({over: foo})
[12:28:12] <fakingfantastic> I just want to be able to call this method outside of hoverIntent
[12:28:17] <`RobW> what?
[12:28:25] <`RobW> what method
[12:28:33] <gx_> `RobW im not sure i follow how an html issue could be causing the js errors, could you explain a little further? sorry about pestering ya. just curious
[12:28:49] <`RobW> gx_: if the html is malformed, datatables will error out
[12:28:50] <NoiseEee> gx_: its complaining about "s", figure out what that is
[12:29:05] <`RobW> I can almost guarantee it's not an issue with the datatables library as much as I've used it
[12:29:13] <`RobW> but I've always gotten errors with it when my table structure was broken
[12:29:15] <knguyen> `RobW: thanks :D
[12:29:36] <`RobW> knguyen: also.. there's several ways to select a div based on a class.
[12:30:00] <gx_> ok, i sort of follow. i'll go over everything with a fine-toothed comb. the only thing is i'm pulling all the data ajax/server-side, and using fncallback to load jPlayer in a column on each row, etc. so i figured that might be the culprit
[12:30:06] <`RobW> knguyen: see: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:31:20] <knguyen> `RobW: that's great. thanks a lot :D
[12:31:59] <`RobW_> err got disconnected.
[12:32:28] <gx_> NoiseEee when you say it's complaining about "s", any idea what that could possibly be? another script using the same variable? an html element named 's'? any suggestions of what to look for?
[12:32:53] <NoiseEee> gx_: you need to learn how to debug
[12:33:23] <gx_> NoiseEee i'm using IE8's debug console, but yes, i dont know enough to make sense of it all
[12:33:38] <tw2113> no one can make sense of IE8's attempt at a console
[12:33:41] <storlihoel> Q: I'm using a theme that has a javascript "Pagebuilder" inside the admin editor (on pages). After moving my site to a new server, the buttons on this pagebuilder is no longer working. The pagebuilder is there, but when I click the buttons nothing happens. Suggestions?
[12:33:45] <NoiseEee> gx_: hmm try to set a breakpoint around there in datables.js that logs "s" to console
[12:33:52] <gx_> ahh, good call
[12:33:58] <rindolf> storlihoel: did you try Firebug or whatever?
[12:35:00] <andrewSC> is there anything like the .load() function but doesn't insert the returned html and only passes it to a callback function?
[12:35:10] <andrewSC> or perhaps loads the html but doesn't show it?
[12:35:21] <storlihoel> rindolf: I'm on google chrome. trying to inspect the element but dont know what to look for. can you point me in the right direction ?
[12:35:22] <andrewSC> i realize i can write some classes to hide the data after it's loaded
[12:35:34] <andrewSC> but I'm not entirely sure if that's the route I wish to choose
[12:36:34] <masentinel900> Someone can help me what is the handler for manager ifa radio is selected?
[12:36:41] <masentinel900> Is for to to a if
[12:37:02] <rindolf> storlihoel: did you set up a callback for the buttons?
[12:37:09] <bytephilia> Can anyone see why the video doesn't stop playing after you try to close it for a second time? (you need to click it to open it and be able to close it first) http://goo.gl/JqntH
[12:37:10] <masentinel900> Some like, if(radio_Buton.selected){}
[12:37:24] <masentinel900> checked..
[12:37:31] <masentinel900> or some like this..
[12:37:58] <andrewSC> masentinel900: you have a couple different choices to look into
[12:38:04] <andrewSC> either read up on form submit
[12:38:20] <andrewSC> or how to register and handle events for click
[12:38:31] <andrewSC> or w/e the action is for a radbtn
[12:39:21] <masentinel900> not, Is just for put a condition...
[12:39:42] <masentinel900> so, if is not checked alert(please select an option)
[12:40:36] <wathek> Hi everybody
[12:40:48] <andrewSC> masentinel900: yes, look into event handling--it's exactly what you need.
[12:41:46] <wathek> is it possible to split the url ? let's say I have something like this : http://www.example.com/arg1/arg2/arg3 and that I'dlike to retrieve arg2 how to do that ?
[12:42:23] <andrewSC> wathek: you could use .split with plain js
[12:42:33] <andrewSC> I'm not familiar with a jQuery solution
[12:42:40] <andrewSC> although, I'm sure there is one.
[12:43:18] <wathek> andrewSC, .split ?
[12:43:35] <wathek> is it a js native function ?
[12:47:01] <chridal> Hi, I am having some issues with my node/jQuery stack. I am responding to requests with a HTTP 200, and returning a JSON object. However, when I try to hit this URL with $.ajax it is triggering the error callback. Any idea on how I can champion this?
[12:47:52] <gnarf> chridal: what are the arguments to the error callback
[12:48:05] <gnarf> chridal: also, have you tried jsonlint on your response?
[12:48:23] <chridal> I am a total noob. What is jsonlint?
[12:48:33] <masentinel900> will be some like this ::  value:checked
[12:48:38] <masentinel900> But dont works
[12:48:39] <`RobW> chridal: is it an external request

The autocomplete widget is similar to what I want, but I don't want to show the results below the text box like they do
[12:49:30] <NoiseEee> mib_mib: thats why CSS was invented
[12:49:31] <chridal> gnarf: I am afraid that wont  work as the server is running on localhost.
[12:49:37] <NoiseEee> so you can style/put it where you want, mib_mib
[12:49:45] <therealklanni> jQuery deferreds are pretty magical
[12:49:57] <mib_mib> NoiseEee: okay - but doesn't the autocomplete widget bind to the text box itself?
[12:49:58] <therealklanni> Just finished my AJAX response cacher, finally
[12:50:25] <gnarf> chridal: copy the response text, paste it into jsonlint... verify that shit is actually json, also, what are the arguments in the error callback... console.log( arguments ) ?
[12:50:36] <NoiseEee> mib_mib: DOM wise, yes i'd imagine, but you can CSS it wherever ?
[12:51:21] <chridal> gnarf: However, when I hit it with a http request with curl, I see that it is in fact returning json; in addition to the headers of course. Console.log(args) only give out [Object object]
[12:51:53] <therealklanni> If my app sends the same AJAX request multiple times, it will first queue identical AJAX requests and then resolve them all with the result of the first response, then cache the result in session storage for 30 seconds for any identical requests sent within that buffer
[12:51:55] <therealklanni> :D
[12:52:49] <chridal> gnarf: https://gist.github.com/4541939 that is the response I get when curling the same adress.
[12:56:05] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/MqmTF/
[12:56:08] <chridal> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/FMeyp/ and this is my jquery
[12:56:13] <masentinel900> I have got a problem...
[12:56:20] <masentinel900> That is loading onready.
[12:57:04] <masentinel900> I made some wrong?
[12:57:18] <Unfortune> yes
[12:58:29] <DocBrown> is anyone around?
[12:58:56] <therealklanni> Nope. I'm asquare.
[12:59:07] <masentinel900> Solve it!!
[12:59:16] <masentinel900> Already I found the mistake
[13:00:25] <masentinel900> I have approblem
[13:00:28] <masentinel900> a problem
[13:00:31] <masentinel900> again!!
[13:02:02] <chridal> What can I do when I get [Object object] is there any thing to inspect an array in JS like with print_r in php?
[13:03:17] <imacinto> chridal: console.log it and then use your preferred developer tools to peek inside
[13:03:56] <imacinto> i.e., console.log(mysteriousThing);
[13:04:24] <chridal> imacinto: Is this possible to do with firefox dev tools? Not figuring it out
[13:04:32] <Unfortune> firebug
[13:04:38] <imacinto> actually, console logging it's not even necessary, you should be able to just cast it into a variable and then inspect it with your developer tools
[13:04:55] <imacinto> chridal: I believe so, give me a sec
[13:05:07] <NoiseEee> hey, all the console info when using jquery-migrate (ie: JQMIGRATE: jQuery.browser is deprecated) isn't going to break IE's that don't have consoles right?
[13:06:09] <chridal> imacinto: I figured it out. Thanks though! Do you have any clue about this though: https://gist.github.com/4542062 ?
[13:06:21] <chridal> it is an error that I am getting on an ajax call
[13:06:44] <imacinto> chridal: not the most readable thing in the world
[13:06:53] <chridal> oh, darn. One sec.
[13:07:59] <chridal> imacinto: http://jsfiddle.net/Dv25y/
[13:08:40] <imacinto> chridal: haha, thanks. that is... very slightly better
[13:09:05] <chridal> imacinto: I am not understanding a single piece of this problem. It is a standard ajax call.
[13:10:49] <chridal> imacinto: http://jsfiddle.net/B8QY8/ do you think that code looks ok?
[13:11:51] <saedelaere> If I do not want to select the next td element but the one after that, how do I do that? next().next() or is there some more elegant way?
[13:13:10] <imacinto> chridal: I think it looks pretty good, yeah. so the problem is you're getting an error despite running a server on localhost:8080 and you're running the code from localhost:8080?
[13:13:39] <tomasm-> hi, are there any decent examples/tutorials on how to create a custom wysiwyg editor (from scratch), using jquery? I'd imagine using jquery might be faster to build than from plain JS, and I kinda dont like tinymce anyway, seems bulky and the code archaic. I'm basically creating a 'newsletter' designer and it needs to do things like insert special objects read from the db, etc (ie news posts, events, etc)
[13:16:05] * saedelaere got it working with nextAll
[13:17:05] <imacinto> saedelaere: I'm curious, were you able to specify a number or did you have to key off something else special about that element?
[13:17:51] <saedelaere> I am using a number
[13:17:53] <saedelaere> $(this).nextAll('td').eq(1).text();
[13:18:22] <saedelaere> with .eq()
[13:18:36] <saedelaere> or did you mean something else imacinto?
[13:19:35] <imacinto> saedelaere: Nope, that's exactly what I was wondering. Good to know, thanks.
[13:23:18] <chridal> imacinto: Correct. I am running a node instance that is responding to the request with a HTTP 200, and a small body.
[13:24:07] <saedelaere> np
[13:29:13] <blez> is there a parent element of document?
[13:29:26] <Unfortune> windows
[13:29:38] <blez> when I do $(document).click() it only fires while I'm not clicking on links
[13:29:42] <czytacz> i'm having a problem with flip! plugin. http://jsfiddle.net/x9prw/  the flip sequence works only once, I cant flip my tiles again without reloading the page. Could anyone take a glimpse?
[13:30:11] <Unfortune> blez: you can add for links too
[13:30:22] <blez> how?
[13:30:28] <Unfortune> $("a")
[13:30:38] <blez> and why it's not working for all elements of 'document'
[13:30:53] <Unfortune> beacuse they are not
[13:31:09] <blez> ok how to make a click event that's called globally
[13:31:12] <blez> no matter where I click
[13:31:17] <Unfortune> oh
[13:31:31] <Unfortune> $(window)
[13:32:00] <blez> doesn't work with IE
[13:32:22] <Unfortune> hmm
[13:32:27] <Unfortune> not sure
[13:32:41] <Unfortune> i did it just like you had
[13:32:46] <Unfortune> $(document
[13:33:09] <NoiseEee> blez: it fires always
[13:33:36] <NoiseEee> $(document).on('click') gets the a tags too, but the a takes you to a new document most likely?
[13:34:16] <Unfortune> on syntax sux
[13:34:31] <NoiseEee> its actually the preferred way to set observers.
[13:35:12] <grafi> until the observers invade our timeline ._.
[13:35:15] <grafi> and then what!
[13:37:03] <EyePulp> graf: you get to protect Anna Torv
[13:38:28] <blez> I did it with $('html')
[13:39:15] <Unfortune> wtf is poedit lol
[13:39:22] <Unfortune> this is getting so lae
[13:39:24] <Unfortune> m
[13:43:26] <Unfortune> if anyone out there is designing web framworks STOP!
[13:43:32] <Unfortune> for the love of god
[13:43:41] <Unfortune> its getting insane poeple
[13:43:45] <systemfault> wut?
[13:44:18] <Unfortune> man these idiots are making frameworks imposible to use
[13:44:33] <systemfault> Perhaps you're the idiot if you cannot make it work... :/
[13:44:37] <systemfault> Just saying...
[13:44:40] <Unfortune> i can build a website faster than i can set up a friken view
[13:44:50] <gates> I am looking for a possible slider/carousel that allows for the showing of 3-4-5-6 items in a single row on large screen and only 1 when on a small screen that also has left/right arrows to allow for sliding between the objects
[13:44:55] <Unfortune> no i have my own freamwoks that is beter
[13:45:00] <systemfault> Usually.. frameworks are for websites having more than 2-3 pages.
[13:45:08] <gates> I searched a lot on carousel and found a lot of things but nothing that were quite there with being responsive and expading
[13:45:32] <Unfortune> systemfault: my framwwork does everything for you
[13:45:40] <systemfault> I'd be surprised.
[13:45:44] <grafi> me three
[13:45:45] <Unfortune> ORM, ACL, templates
[13:45:49] <Unfortune> controller
[13:45:54] <systemfault> Symfony 2 is a real framework.
[13:45:55] <Unfortune> view, model
[13:46:08] <Unfortune> i am using sym
[13:46:14] <systemfault> Good.
[13:46:17] <Unfortune> for one of my projects
[13:46:17] <systemfault> Then we agree.
[13:46:20] <Unfortune> NO!
[13:46:23] <Unfortune> i like zend
[13:46:29] <systemfault> Eww..
[13:46:31] <gates> I have no idea what to each search for
[13:46:32] <systemfault> Welcome back to 2000
[13:46:33] <Unfortune> and YII
[13:47:08] <Unfortune> systemfault: you shud use mine instead
[13:47:33] <gates> a slider that offers something like:
[13:47:39] <gates> On HUGE: < [_] [_] [_] [_] > | On Tablet: < [_] [_] [_] > | On Mobile: < [_] >
[13:47:47] <gates> each box being an html element
[13:47:52] <systemfault> OF COURSE, I'll surely use a "framework" done by some guy on IRC which is probably not even tested... and is probably used on a single website.
[13:48:06] <Unfortune> systemfault: shut up
[13:48:09] <Unfortune> right now
[13:48:12] <Unfortune> :O
[13:48:37] <gates> any ideas?
[13:48:37] <james_lau> Greetings! Does anyone know how to center a popup window in JS? I have a JSFiddle link here:http://jsfiddle.net/blitz128/BPerE/10/ Thanks!
[13:48:50] <Unfortune> gates: wats the prob
[13:49:08] <Unfortune> james_lau: with CSS
[13:49:39] <gates> Unfortune: I am looking for a prebuilt carousel that works in a sort of specific way, at least close
[13:49:53] <Unfortune> james_lau: you first make a full screen overlay
[13:50:02] <james_lau> @ Unfortunate how come not with JS?
[13:50:03] <Unfortune> then put ur popup inside overlay
[13:50:12] <Unfortune> and use margin
[13:50:26] <james_lau> I tried following or breaking down this link: http://www.nigraphic.com/blog/java-script/how-open-new-window-popup-center-screen
[13:50:29] <Unfortune> because it looks glitchy when u scroll
[13:51:09] <gates> Unfortune: the website is responsive so the slider of course needs to be, and inside of it there are multiple "pool" html objects, if each object is lets say 300 you can fit only 1 across on mobile and u can fit 3 across on a tablet, etc, etc. If it doesn't fit across it hides off and slides on when a user clicks or automatically sliden
[13:51:17] <gates> Unfortune: to show the objects like so- On Compter: < [_] [_] [_] [_] > | On Tablet: < [_] [_] [_] > | On Mobile: < [_] >
[13:51:41] <Unfortune> maybe u build ur own
[13:51:55] <imacinto> james_lau: I don't know if this is The Right Way, but I would fetch the dimensions of your window and then the dimensions of the overlay, then fill some vars with the appropriate math to determine your x and y offsets. then apply CSS to that element based on those vars
[13:52:24] <systemfault> james_lau: You can usually cover the screen with a div with position: fixed; and a rgba background color... And to center it, you could also use position: fixed; left: 50%; top: 50%; and add a negative top + left margin equal to half of the popup width/height
[13:52:51] <james_lau> You guys are looking at http://jsfiddle.net/blitz128/BPerE/11/?
[13:52:56] <gates> Unfortune: it seems that might be theonly way but idk if i would even know how
[13:53:27] <Unfortune> lol
[13:53:36] <Unfortune> cmon itl be fun
[13:53:51] <Unfortune> i made a sweet carousel before
[13:54:37] <Unfortune> james_lau: ill help you if you take out everything by overlay and popup
[13:54:46] <james_lau> This window needs to be in a different browser screen
[13:55:19] <gates> Unfortune: if only time allows, i doubt it will
[13:55:53] <Unfortune> yea this will take atleast 2 days
[13:56:00] <james_lau> @Unfortunate, what do you mean?
[13:56:25] <Unfortune> james_lau: beacuse i dont want to parse thru a crapload of ur code
[13:56:29] <Unfortune> unrelated
[13:56:54] <imacinto> james_lau: sorry, I definitely didn't look at the fiddle
[13:56:58] <imacinto> just did now
[13:58:41] <imacinto> james_lau: my suggestion still makes sense hombre. determine resolution, subtract bounds of new window, divide by 2, throw into your top and left attributes
[13:58:46] <nabr0_> i've got a script that's doing some sorting of option/li elements based on a data attribute, however, in IE7/8 after the sorting, the select elements have the last option selected and forcing the first element to be selected doesn't seem to work
[13:58:55] <nabr0_> can someone take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/qy5Aq/3/
[13:59:19] <Unfortune> james_lau: its still a much smoother look if done w CSS
[13:59:52] <imacinto> Unfortunate: overlays are cool but dude wants popups for whatever reason
[14:00:16] <Unfortune> yea popup in overlay
[14:00:29] <Unfortune> one u can then drag around w .dragglable
[14:00:47] <james_lau> @Unfortune, I need it all in JS. CSS isn't going to work out with the client
[14:00:51] <Unfortune> one that also always centered when you drag the scroller
[14:00:59] <kripster> could someone tell me what is the best way to set the label name of car left of the textfield and also how do i place the dropdown make below the clear and search button http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/, thx
[14:01:47] <imacinto> anyway, I'm out
[14:01:49] <Unfortune> james_lau: hmm thats interesting
[14:02:09] <Unfortune> i didnt know jquery positioned elements
[14:02:15] <Unfortune> lol
[14:02:18] <james_lau> imacinto: i don't understand what you mean
[14:02:35] <Unfortune> i thot its something like $().css
[14:02:39] <Unfortune> lolololol
[14:02:59] <Unfortune> james_lau: if you do w js and jquery its still going to be CSS hahahahaha
[14:03:15] <Unfortune> :DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[14:04:23] <Unfortune> but yeah i dont see any websites that do it as clean as me
[14:05:01] <systemfault> At work, I simply use fancybox2 for my popup needs..
[14:05:03] <Unfortune> most do it w js where the popup skips around which is not necesary
[14:05:08] <kripster> its probably something very simple, do i need to style it using css??
[14:05:39] <Unfortune> some popups scroll w the content
[14:05:42] <Unfortune> which is bullshit
[14:05:46] <Unfortune> lol
[14:06:04] <Unfortune> some dont center when you resize the browser
[14:06:20] <james_lau> i dunno then...
[14:06:43] <Unfortune> just use fancybox then
[14:06:59] <Unfortune> its probably very close to my popup clas
[14:07:08] <james_lau> i'm not going to complicated with more JS when there's probably a simple solution to this....
[14:07:31] <Unfortune> you need both
[14:07:46] <Unfortune> just more of it w CSS
[14:08:00] <james_lau> then tell me how they did it with this site: http://fff.cmiscm.com/#!/section/wipertypo
[14:08:20] <james_lau> click on the social links to the left
[14:08:54] <Unfortune> thats canvas
[14:09:46] <kripster> do I need to style the textfield to place the label in line and left of the textfield, do i need to do the same with styling the make dropdown to be placed below the 2 buttons, thx for your help guys. http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/
[14:09:51] <systemfault> james_lau: I'll write you one quickly...
[14:11:36] <systemfault> james_lau: Here's a very basic one: http://jsfiddle.net/HzdD2/
[14:13:21] <Unfortune> systemfault: exactly
[14:13:24] <Unfortune> very nice
[14:13:50] <Unfortune> except its fixed
[14:14:11] <Unfortune> you cheated lol
[14:14:22] <systemfault> Fixed is fine for most of the cases.
[14:14:39] <Unfortune> lol but its less code automatic
[14:14:53] <Unfortune> watever lol food
[14:14:58] <Unfortune> bbl
[14:15:27] <kripster> can anyone help?
[14:20:35] <kripster> could someone help with a simple styling issue i am having
[14:21:14] <gates> Unfortune: how would i go about building that *smh*
[14:21:18] <gates> smack*
[14:23:38] <kripster> could someone tell me what is the best way to set the label name of car left of the textfield and also how do i place the dropdown make below the clear and search button http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/, thx
[14:25:56] <nabr0_> must have been a typo, fixed it
[14:27:08] <DRWhite> hi all
[14:27:29] <DRWhite> I have an issue with performing a POST or GET or LOAD...
[14:27:33] <kripster> can someone tell me how to position the make dropdown below the clear and search button thx  http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/
[14:28:31] <ggdevelop> in jquery mobile: how do i display my whole page whithout  need to scrolling it?
[14:29:43] <DRWhite> I am on d1.com and including javascript from d2.com, and in the script on d2.com it creates an iFrame on d1.com. But the script also performs a LOAD or GET or POST to d2.com where the script is oficially hosted, but it keeps telling me.....
[14:29:45] <DRWhite>  âGiven URL is not allowed by the Application configuration.: One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the App's settings.  It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL, or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App's domains.â
[14:30:07] <DRWhite> Is anyone able to assist?
[14:32:05] <DRWhite> ggdevelop: Pl;ease check PM
[14:37:34] <Absolute0> What's the difference between .load() and .read() ?
[14:39:18] <systemfault> Never heard of .read :/
[14:40:12] <Absolute0> .ready()
[14:42:11] <systemfault> .ready is called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[14:42:11] <b-ot> systemfault, memorised âreadyâ.
[14:42:21] <systemfault> fuuuu stupid bot
[14:42:42] <systemfault> --- .load is called once all the tree is parsed and all the resources are loaded.
[14:43:03] <systemfault> So.. .load is called a lot later than .ready
[14:43:15] <Absolute0> so .ready() is when the browser read the entire html, but not yet downloaded the remaining files?
[14:43:30] <Absolute0> will .load() take care of webfonts?
[14:45:14] <systemfault> yeah for the first question
[14:45:18] <systemfault> Not sure for the second.
[14:45:37] <systemfault> I never use .load for the document... It happens too late.
[14:46:01] <DRWhite> Anyone know how to fix cross domain issue?
[14:46:21] <DRWhite> just when using the LOAD or POST or GET?
[14:47:19] <Nece228> hi, whats wrong with it: http://paste.kde.org/648086
[14:47:53] <Absolute0> Nece228: use jsfiddle
[14:48:06] <wessly_> Hello, can somebody help me with one code - http://jsfiddle.net/HcQKG/ it's working but i want to be with exact match.
[14:48:12] <Absolute0> Nece228: missing comma before function.
[14:48:45] <systemfault> DRWhite: What<s the problem?
[14:48:47] <Nece228> oh im so stupdi
[14:49:00] <Nece228> havent done any coding for 4 months
[14:49:03] <kripster> could some tell me how to move my footer, next and back button to bottom of screen but will be moved up to top when i click on the collapse car http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/3/?
[14:49:07] <Nece228> thanks for figuring that out
[14:49:23] <Absolute0> kripster: absolute positions?
[14:49:25] <DRWhite> âGiven URL is not allowed by the Application configuration.: One or more of the given URLs is not allowed by the App's settings.  It must match the Website URL or Canvas URL, or the domain must be a subdomain of one of the App's domains.â
[14:49:50] <DRWhite> It happens wethe I do a LOAD or POST or GET
[14:50:26] <kripster> absolute0: what is the difference between absolute and relative, am i styling this all wrong, thx for your help
[14:50:53] <Absolute0> kripster: #css is a better channel for this
[14:51:11] <wessly_> Absolute0, http://jsfiddle.net/HcQKG/ can u take a look?
[14:51:23] <wessly_> How to do it for exact match?
[14:51:29] <DRWhite> We used standard JavaScript for a while to try to get it working, but that had similar issue with cross domain issue. So the other day I moved to JQuery to hopefully get it working by retrieving the HTML from the remote domain.
[14:51:41] <DRWhite> But that error just kept hapenning no matter what
[14:52:10] <aghouseh> anyone here have experience with initializing a DOM-added pinterest element after the script has already been loaded?
[14:52:13] <wessly_> DRWhite, file permissions?
[14:52:20] <DRWhite> Permissions are fine.
[14:52:37] <tw2113> CORS issue
[14:52:42] <DRWhite> The script is being called on D1.com and the script is hosted on D2.com
[14:52:52] <tw2113> moving to jquery wouldn't solve it if js alone didn't work
[14:52:52] <kripster> absolute0: ok, so for instance if i remove all the styling and just want to move the make select below the clear and search button what is my best approach http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/
[14:53:18] <DRWhite> And it's tryign to do a load to get a piece of text from D2.com.
[14:53:25] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[14:54:29] <DRWhite> But a load is performing an HTTP request.
[14:54:35] <DRWhite> So ti should not need it.
[14:54:47] <tw2113> d1.com != d2.com
[14:54:51] <tw2113> thus different origins
[14:55:23] <DRWhite> So you are sayign that Mozilla does ot support the internet any more?
[14:55:31] <DRWhite> And they don't allow HTTP rewuests?
[14:55:47] <tw2113> i think you'd get this issue regardless of browser
[14:56:23] <DRWhite> So why can't I perform a standard HTTP request?
[14:56:47] <tw2113> did you read the link i posted?
[14:56:56] <kripster> kripster:test
[14:58:00] <DRWhite> So how do I resolve my issue?
[14:58:24] <DRWhite> I read that page like 2 weeks ago when I first had the issue.
[14:58:28] <Absolute0> kripster: your jsfiddle was all out of whack: http://jsfiddle.net/HcQKG/6/
[14:58:44] <Absolute0> kripster: look up the api for proper usuage of each method.
[14:58:45] <DRWhite> When using plain JavaScript. not XHTTPRequests'
[14:58:49] <Unfortune> systemfault: what i meant is that frameworks can and should handle a lot of the setting up automatically
[14:58:55] <Unfortune> instead of having the user do it
[14:58:55] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know if $('#id .el') is faster as the id help narrow the search?
[14:59:13] <Unfortune> thats the point of a frameworks, and not just the structure of it
[14:59:56] <kripster> Asbolute0: thats not my jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/HcQKG/6/??
[15:00:14] <Absolute0> jesus, it's noob day today
[15:00:34] <DRWhite> noob day?
[15:00:43] <DRWhite> Jesus has a NooB day?
[15:01:08] <Absolute0> DRWhite: I never bothered to ask.
[15:01:11] <jrockjiggz> everyday 10,000 ppl are new to jquery
[15:01:25] <Unfortune> lies
[15:01:51] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: depends on the selector engine
[15:02:07] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: selector engine? jquery 1.8.2
[15:02:16] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: lots of selector engines use bottom up filtering
[15:02:18] <chinoto> gnarf: something besides sizzle O_O
[15:02:29] <chinoto> blasphemy!
[15:02:32] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: can you explain?
[15:02:36] <DRWhite> Absolute0: Bugger, would have been good to know...
[15:02:39] <kripster> Absolute0: you've lost me, i think the jsfiddle you sent to me was for <wessly_>
[15:02:51] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: bottom up means '#id .class' is better than just '.class' ?
[15:03:08] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: no
[15:03:12] <gnarf> it matches .class first
[15:03:17] <gnarf> then filters based on children of #id
[15:03:20] <DRWhite> Absolute0: Just glad I'm not a NooB, just a newbie when it comes to javascript.. Just a few things that I still don't know about it... i'm a PHP/MySQL specialist after all..
[15:03:22] <chinoto> jrockjiggz: jquery uses this: http://sizzlejs.com/
[15:03:33] <gnarf> thats how most browsers select elements
[15:03:49] <jrockjiggz> hmm, interesting
[15:04:09] <oojacoboo> so, I have a DOM element I'm trying to get the height() of, but it's calculating a much smaller height.  I feel like it's possible it's calculating it before the DOM can complete the loading of it since it's an ajax request and content loaded into another div.  Can I use .ready() on the element?
[15:04:14] <kripster> can someone tell me how to move the make select below the search and clear button http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/
[15:04:49] <oojacoboo> kripster: move the html
[15:05:02] <oojacoboo> clear: both on it
[15:05:43] <kripster> oojacoboo: what you mean ?
[15:05:56] <oojacoboo> I mean, move the html after the buttons...
[15:06:07] <oojacoboo> this is not a jquery question
[15:06:18] <Unfortune> y u so many qs here regarding CSS lol
[15:06:19] <b-ot> (å±®'Ð')å±®
[15:06:21] <Unfortune> this is JS
[15:06:41] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: http://jsperf.com/selector-perf-test22
[15:06:57] <kripster> it is after the buttons
[15:06:59] <tw2113> some people think this is a general webdev room
[15:07:13] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: brilliant! thats perfect
[15:07:41] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: interestingly $("#id").find(".class") is the "more performant" way to do it most likely
[15:07:43] <gnarf> ill add it
[15:07:57] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: i ask because I want to use like:
[15:08:05] <Unfortune> jquery spawned a whole diff level of noobs
[15:08:12] <Unfortune> uber pre noobs
[15:08:14] <Unfortune> !
[15:08:37] <Unfortune> what should we coin these folks
[15:08:38] <jrockjiggz> $('#masterParent').on('click','.classEl', function(){});   //replace '.classEl' with '#container .classEl'
[15:09:11] <jrockjiggz> as #container is a much more narrow scope.. but may also be a replaced element
[15:09:16] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: http://cl.ly/image/1u3e1A0T1I3N
[15:09:26] <kripster> hilarious
[15:09:28] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: in that case its even slower
[15:09:30] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: :)
[15:09:41] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: .on() has code optimized for "simple selectors"
[15:10:07] <gnarf> so .class #id tagname
[15:10:15] <Unfortune> stop being such a pre-noob
[15:10:16] <gnarf> those 3 pass through a faster optimized matching function
[15:10:20] <jrockjiggz> gnarf: but it seems simple selectors aren't narrow enough, unless i'm missing something
[15:10:42] <kripster>  can someone tell me how to move the make select below the search and clear button http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/ ?
[15:10:43] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: honestly though, this is unlikely to be the root cause of any "performance" problem in the first place
[15:10:55] <jrockjiggz> gnarf; thanks for the insight.. big helps
[15:11:34] <tw2113> kripster, http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/6/
[15:12:13] <tw2113> apparently you missed people saying "clear: both" to your stuff
[15:13:09] <kripster> tw2113: thx
[15:13:29] <otherj> can't wait for flexbox to be mainstream
[15:13:45] <tw2113> at least part of why it was floating upwards is because your left/right buttons have floats on them and your select didn't
[15:14:22] <kripster> all pretty new to me, need to find a gd website that can help with styling etc
[15:14:25] <tw2113> yes, details like that matter
[15:21:14] <chinoto> gnarf: are the two classes in that perf image significantly different (eg count, placement in the DOM)
[15:24:29] <wessly_> Hey guys what is the mothod to auto create jsfiddle demo page because code work in jsfiddle but in my page doesnt?
[15:24:43] <wessly_> I want to see how is the real in html.
[15:25:13] <kripster> tw2113: if i wanted to select more than one label what do i do? label[for="make", "vrm"] ?
[15:27:11] <chinoto> wessly_: right click the display frame> This Frame> View Frame Source (at least in Firefox)
[15:29:25] <chinoto> wessly_: or you can add "show" to the end of the url, for example: http://jsfiddle.net/e8u8s/19/show/
[15:29:54] <tw2113> you'd have to do a separate version for each kripster
[15:30:10] <tw2113> label[for="make"], label[for="foo"] { }
[15:30:16] <kripster> ok, thx
[15:30:21] <tw2113> or you could just do label {}
[15:30:30] <DRWhite> using postMessage(data,origin); How do I target the parent frame?
[15:34:27] <chinoto> kripster: you could say $('label').filter('[name="foo"],[name="bar"]'), which may or may not be more efficient (less code though :)
[15:36:07] <kripster> thx guys, one last question and then i'm done, how can i center name of car http://jsfiddle.net/gpQwW/9/ thx again for your help
[15:37:00] <tw2113> #vdet { text-align: center; }
[15:37:41] <oojacoboo> so, I have a DOM element I'm trying to get the height() of, but it's calculating a much smaller height.  I feel like it's possible it's calculating it before the DOM can complete the loading of it since it's an ajax request and content loaded into another div.  Can I use .ready() on the element?
[15:38:14] <oojacoboo> I tried the ready actually and a timeout, but still having issues
[15:38:26] <oojacoboo> I also logged the html and it's all there correctly
[15:38:40] <oojacoboo> so it's certainly some sort of painting/calculating issue
[15:39:02] <aghouseh> oojacoboo: try .outerHeight() or .outerHeight(true)
[15:39:24] <oojacoboo> aghouseh: I did, trying true...
[15:39:33] <oojacoboo> aghouseh: no go
[15:39:40] <aghouseh> oojacoboo:  outerHeight(true) includes margin
[15:39:50] <oojacoboo> aghouseh: yea, this isn't a noob issue ;)
[15:39:54] <aghouseh> are you loading images within it?
[15:39:58] <oojacoboo> no images
[15:40:00] <aghouseh> weird
[15:40:06] <kripster> tw2113: sorry i mean to have the label vertically centered to the text field
[15:40:21] <DRWhite> I am tryign to target the parent window of the iframe to perform a postMessage()... self.window = current frame... but I can't target the parent window or anything to perform a message post... Any knowledge of how to target parent window/frame?
[15:40:21] <chinoto> kripster: for the input below it, remove the float and use "margin:0 auto;"
[15:41:09] <chinoto> or "margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" if you want to avoid overriding top and bottom
[15:41:44] <oojacoboo> aghouseh: does it calculate where overflow is set on a container?
[15:42:17] <oojacoboo> b/c when it first loads, it's possible the container height is restricting it with overflow to scroll
[15:42:30] <oojacoboo> I need the height of the contents, not the height of the container itself
[15:42:33] <aghouseh> sounds like that might close to the right track
[15:42:44] <tw2113> display: block; text-align: center; kripster
[15:43:03] <tw2113> on the label
[15:43:33] <aghouseh> oojacoboo: try temporarily setting the container's overflow to visible and then get the height?
[15:43:39] <oojacoboo> aghouseh: I think I want scrollHeight
[15:44:21] <chinoto> kripster: vertically... you mean to the left side?
[15:44:38] <kripster> sorry guys, i am not making much sense, i want the label vertically central to the textfield, its needs moved down slightly
[15:46:30] <kripster> chinoto: no i mean moved down slightly
[15:47:50] <crubb> ladies and gentlemen, can you give me a primer on how to handle cross-domain ajax errors based on http status codes? I want to catch a 401, but on using $.ajax({..., error: function(jqxhr){console.log(jqxhr.status)}}) I only get "0"
[15:48:00] <chinoto> kripster: ok, placeholder text inside the input needs to move, in that case you want to investigate vertical-align and possibly line-height
[15:48:53] <kripster> chinoto: thx
[15:49:55] <chinoto> kripster: unfortunately that isn't doing anything for me :/
[15:50:27] <chinoto> seeya :/
[15:50:31] <kripster> sorry man, i am a complete newbie at this
[15:50:34] <kripster> bye
[15:51:07] <Fall> Do we deal with questions about jQuery plugins in here?
[15:51:12] <Fall> Specificall jquery.popovers
[15:54:01] <acidjazz> Fall: depends how much you got
[15:55:08] <Fall> :) I might keep fumbling around for a little bit. Thanks
[16:02:08] <Unfortune> so
[16:02:31] <Unfortune> wers my frinds :D
[16:02:52] <shoky> crubb: by cross domain do you mean JSONP?
[16:14:03] <crubb> shoky: actually no, json using Access-Control-Allow-* headers
[16:14:37] <Unfortune> omg
[16:14:48] <Unfortune> who elese is not happy with framworks
[16:15:01] <Unfortune> i think they can be designed so much beter
[16:19:44] <star_prone> Hi
[16:19:51] <star_prone> where can I paste some code?
[16:20:27] <Eviltwin> That's covered in the topic
[16:22:37] <star_prone> I have a variable containg some html code
[16:22:46] <ipengineer> I am trying to create a page that has a tree view on the left and a content area on the right that updates without the tree view losing its states. What would be the best way to do that? So on click the canvas on the right is updated with the contents. something like: http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/api/Ext.app.Application
[16:23:16] <Unfortune> star_prone: paste to noteys.com
[16:23:55] <star_prone> if I try to do $("transfers-wrapper").append(content), nothing will happen; if I try to do $("transfers-wrapper").append()
[16:24:07] <star_prone> if I try to do $("transfers-wrapper").append(content), nothing will happen; if I try to do $("transfers-wrapper").append("test") this will work
[16:24:16] <star_prone> anyone has any idea?
[16:24:52] <star_prone> ipengineer: ajax
[16:25:06] <Eviltwin> Wow
[16:25:40] <ipengineer> star_prone: Would that be considered an HTML5 panel on the right
[16:26:01] <rushainem> hey can someone here tell me how I can contribute to the new & remodeled websites? which Github repos are for the jQuery websites?
[16:26:05] <star_prone> ipengineer: not necessarily
[16:26:21] <star_prone> jquery has nothing to do with your html markup
[16:26:45] <Eviltwin> rushainem: Check these out: https://github.com/jquery
[16:31:49] <rushainem> Eviltwin: are all the .com repos looking for contributors?
[16:32:07] <Eviltwin> Kinda depends on what you have to contribute
[16:39:00] <johndoe> whats the simplest way of sending data from server to client using jquery?
[16:40:28] <anew> server to clien? json ?
[16:40:53] <Eviltwin> That's a remarkably vague question
[16:41:04] <johndoe> yes, because i dont know much about the thing at hand XD
[16:41:05] <johndoe> sorry
[16:41:21] <johndoe> i know how to use ajax to send data client -> browser
[16:41:36] <johndoe> but how do i begin the transfer from the server side
[16:41:39] <johndoe> * client -> server
[16:42:02] <johndoe> i want to write a simple chat application
[16:42:13] <johndoe> where multiple clients send messages to server
[16:42:49] <Eviltwin> This is a Node JS 101 project
[16:43:26] <johndoe> ah
[16:43:46] <johndoe> Eviltwin: what if im already using Django at the server side?
[16:45:49] <Eviltwin> Then I suggest you visit StackOverflow
[16:48:39] <johndoe> Eviltwin: not nice.
[16:48:55] <johndoe> i know how to send data from the server
[16:49:04] <johndoe> im just not sure how im supposed to receive it client side
[16:49:05] <Eviltwin> Okay... how is that?
[16:49:14] <johndoe> json object
[16:49:28] <Eviltwin> Through what format?
[16:49:39] <johndoe> ?
[16:50:23] <Eviltwin> You're using a TCP stream
[16:50:37] <Eviltwin> Your server can't send data without receiving it somewhere
[16:50:52] <johndoe> ah
[16:50:54] <johndoe> i see
[16:50:55] <Eviltwin> So
[16:50:58] <Eviltwin> I don't understand
[16:51:02] <johndoe> this aint a simple problem, is it?
[16:51:02] <johndoe> xD
[16:51:05] <Eviltwin> How you can be sending data from the server but not receiving it
[16:51:25] <Eviltwin> I doubt you're actually sending it at all
[16:51:56] <johndoe> Eviltwin: maybe i worded myself badly. i havent done anything yet. im just trying to work it out first.
[16:52:25] <Eviltwin> johndoe: I suggest reading this: http://webcloud.se/log/AJAX-in-Django-with-jQuery/
[16:52:30] <Eviltwin> Should help you out
[16:52:40] <Eviltwin> I don't use Django so I can't really help you with that half
[16:52:48] <johndoe> thanks :)
[16:52:52] <Eviltwin> And you realistically need to do both halves at the same time
[16:53:02] <johndoe> i owe you one :)
[16:56:28] <thisboy> http://jsfiddle.net/SsbhE/ -- dropdown menu using hoverIntent.  But how do I also show() during "on click", and hide() during "off click" for mobiles and tablets? Do I have to make an entire new function for that?
[17:02:27] <s0x> hey guys ... just noticed the update to v1.9.0 and realised that $.browser is removed by this version. Is there another way to use the same functionality? Im using markitup wysiwyg edtior which depends on this property ...
[17:07:01] <mmlac> why does $.ajax() trigger a .done when plain text or HTML is returned but a .fail() if I return JSON?
[17:07:28] <mmlac> Both requests return 2 200 OK
[17:07:33] <mmlac> s/2/a
[17:11:50] <mmlac> and what determines the state of the request?
[17:14:33] <mmlac> omg, setting dataType to json fixes the problem. Annoying when a failed auto detect == error.  *sigh*
[17:16:49] <thisboy> how to do an "unless mobile or tablet" statement?
[17:17:32] <thisboy> nevermind i worded my google search wrongly
[17:40:59] <chris_> I have a function that calls $.get(..) with fixed parameters, but the success callback doesn't fire when the function is called from certain places and I can't see why. any idea?
[19:15:13] <ChrisBolton> I have a drop down menu thats part of a form. Any suggestions an event listener as I want to submit the form once the selection has been chosen? Right now i't's tide to on click but I see a multitude of problems with that, especially because the drop down list is paginated.
[19:19:57] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ ChrisBolton
[19:19:57] <bot-t> ChrisBolton, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:22:35] <ChrisBolton> Eviltwin: I've reproduced the infinite scroll with remote data example from http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/ but I'm trying to figure out the best even to trigger the post and subsequent ajax load of the index. There is a working example on the site.
[19:25:10] <ChrisBolton> even = event
[19:25:37] <happyface> I moved all my attr's to prop's. How come prop("name") doesnt get the name= value?
[19:28:42] <Fenikkusu> Can someone help point in me in the right direction. I'm trying to understand how to develop a plugin in Jquery, but it has me rather confused. Originally I learned a method of saying functionname:function(){},functionname2:function(). The next was saying to use function(){return this.each(){}) So...when...where...what?
[19:29:56] <Fenikkusu> I also can't seem to learn the difference between a plugin and a widget
[19:36:58] <happyface> how do I get "value" and "name" attributes without the use of deprecated attr?
[19:38:53] <coldhead> happyface: prop() ?
[19:39:00] <coldhead> is attr() formally deprecated?
[19:39:01] <coldhead> that's sad
[19:39:06] <happyface> coldhead, it doesn't get 'value' and 'name' though
[19:39:12] <coldhead> then use attr()
[19:39:17] <coldhead> to hell with the naysayers
[19:39:29] <happyface> yeah I switched my broken code back to attr
[19:39:40] <happyface> after spending like 15 mins figuring out how to get it to work without it
[19:39:44] <coldhead> it's not deprecated
[19:39:48] <coldhead> according to the docs
[19:39:53] <happyface> it will be removed in the next version though
[19:40:22] <coldhead> where are you reading that?
[19:40:42] <happyface> I thought I read that somewhere, maybe I'm too drunk
[19:40:54] <coldhead> certain behaviour has changed
[19:41:00] <coldhead> for missing attributes
[19:41:13] <coldhead> and the old prop vs attr thing is still falling out
[19:41:19] <coldhead> but attr is pretty essential
[19:41:25] <coldhead> i don't think it's going anywhere
[19:42:17] <happyface> ok good stuff, thanks
[19:42:50] <systemfault> I can't see why .attr would be deprecated, it wouldn't make any sense.
[19:49:31] <Chopps> hey guys, need help, this dialog i create is not centered, when i click the button to display it, its not aligned. heres an example: http://198.98.118.230/sppc/usuarios/test can you guys help me? btw im using jquery 1.7.1, jqueryui 1.8.16 with a custom theme. Thanks in advance
[19:49:51] <rootcoma> is there a replacement for $.browser?
[19:50:54] <systemfault> I'd be surprised as $.browser is evil with a capital E
[19:51:54] <coldhead> worse than hitler?
[19:53:15] <systemfault> Hitler himself predicted the evilness of $.browser
[19:53:38] <rootcoma> haha.. I didn't think $.browser was so bad.. it did its job
[19:54:39] <systemfault> A job that should have been better done using feature detection
[19:54:50] <mfoxdogg|work> sorry to ask but is there a way to wait for .appendTo() or .html() to finish?
[19:55:24] <systemfault> mfoxdogg|work: They both sync functions, not sure what you want
[19:56:26] <rootcoma> found a nice 1 liner to keep the evil $.browser in my code. http://pupunzi.open-lab.com/2012/08/14/jquery-1-8-and-browser-detection/
[19:56:34] <rootcoma> $.browser.msie = /msie/.test(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase());
[19:56:36] <rootcoma> heheh
[19:58:13] <mfoxdogg|work> systemfault: code http://jsfiddle.net/CPMSY/ it takes over s sceond to do the appendTo however the loading div disappears before thr appendto is done
[19:59:44] <mfoxdogg|work> i just want the loader to stay until the appendto is finished
[20:02:13] <ngharo> append is syncronous so not sure how that is happening
[20:28:38] <CapMax> hi
[20:28:46] <CapMax> is it possible to do something like loading an image and finding out its width?
[20:28:50] <CapMax> so where the width is not specified
[20:29:06] <CapMax> if i create a new img element and specify src, returning attr('width') gives null
[20:30:34] <systemfault> Loading an image is async.
[20:31:44] <systemfault> var image = $('<img>'); image.on('load', function(event) { console.log($(this).width()); }); image.attr('src',bleh);
[20:32:57] <defaultro> hey guys, .val() will pull the value from the input field correct?
[20:34:06] <defaultro> what if I want to convert the value of that into something? $('time_sec').val(), I would like to convert it to mins
[20:34:53] <Chopps> then do the operation, var mins = $('time_sec').val() / 60;
[20:34:55] <defaultro> can I put that inside my function? var minutes = converttoMInutes($('time_sec').val());
[20:35:02] <defaultro> that's true
[20:35:11] <defaultro> but my function work too?
[20:35:21] <Chopps> yes, u can do that
[20:35:24] <defaultro> cool
[20:35:58] <Chopps> i like to use variables though, easier to make changes if i have to
[20:36:17] <defaultro> k
[20:36:42] <CapMax> also is it possible to give these functions names
[20:36:49] <CapMax> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[20:36:57] <CapMax> (no conflicts up there)
[20:42:57] <Chopps> hey guys, need help, this dialog i create is not centered, when i click the button to display it, its not aligned. heres an example: http://198.98.118.230/sppc/usuarios/test can you guys help me? btw im using jquery 1.7.1, jqueryui 1.8.16 with a custom theme. Thanks in advance
[20:47:07] <CapMax> systemfault: bit of trouble with $(this).width() - it returns 0
[20:47:58] <kegster> if i have a number, 10, that may come to javascript as a string, do i need to do anything to it in order to compare using > or < ? i'm returning 8 but if $var > 7 fails, even tho 8 echos
[20:48:16] <hesperaux> hello
[20:49:14] <systemfault> CapMax: Is that line in the 'load' event callback?
[20:49:27] <Aqeel> hi all
[20:49:31] <CapMax> systemfault: it is yes
[20:49:54] <systemfault> Hmm :/
[20:49:58] <Aqeel> what is the best way to create a flow control of any system controls..
[20:50:08] <systemfault> CapMax: You set the load event before setting the src?
[20:50:15] <CapMax> systemfault: yes it is
[20:50:27] <Chopps> and i found the solution, jquery.dimensions.js plugin was making it fail. removed it and it works
[20:50:30] <CapMax> i can get other things from it, like if i output the attr('src'), that will work
[20:50:30] <hesperaux> If i add elements to a page, will jquery functions that look for those id/classes work on the new elements?
[20:50:37] <Aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[20:50:45] <systemfault> CapMax: That's weird..
[20:50:53] <zhanger> what happened to the comments on jquery documentation o.o
[20:51:08] <Aqeel> i have top control buttons and i am going to create the situations and conditions based on instatnces..
[20:51:51] <Aqeel> so how should i be approaching this... from one button to another or simply look for all possibilities...??
[20:51:57] <CapMax> systemfault: do i need to append the image anywhere?
[20:52:37] <hesperaux> I'm adding forms to a web page via a jquery call. I have another jquery call that sets onSubmit="" for all forms. However, dynamically added forms still appear to be submitting. What am I doing wrong?
[20:53:21] <Aqeel> on() does look for new elements hesperaux
[20:53:37] <Aqeel> or delegation elements
[20:53:54] <systemfault> CapMax: Seems that it doesn't work with .height()/.width() but it works using the dom :/ 2 sec
[20:53:56] <hesperaux> Aqeel, sorry, I'm new to this. I don't understand what you mean.
[20:54:18] <CapMax> systemfault: i think it might be because of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1472303/jquery-get-width-of-element-when-not-visible-display-none
[20:54:21] <CapMax> ?
[20:54:26] <Aqeel> can you fiddle your code and i explain
[20:54:33] <systemfault> CapMax: http://jsfiddle.net/USXa9/
[20:54:56] <shoky> hesperaux: $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(e) { e.preventDefault() })   if you wanna prevent automatic submit of all forms
[20:55:13] <hesperaux> shoky, nice. thanks
[20:55:20] <CapMax> systemfault: ah that works thanks
[20:56:15] <Aqeel> hi shoky
[20:57:24] <Lann> Why won't this syntax work? $( ".accordion" ).accordion({active: ($(this).hasClass('expanded') ? true : false), /* Collapsed by default unless style expanded present */ ...
[20:57:39] <shoky> hi Aqeel
[20:59:14] <hesperaux> Aqeel, http://jsfiddle.net/nRpPh/
[21:00:27] <hesperaux> any critique is good, really
[21:00:43] <coldhead> i don't like the font
[21:00:47] <hesperaux> xD
[21:01:25] <aghouseh> haha
[21:01:32] <aghouseh> coldhead: +1
[21:01:56] <hesperaux> one issue is that clicking add new adds a form, but the added form's button does not perform the same action as the original "add new" button.
[21:03:02] <hesperaux> another issue is that adding forms does not expand the accordion div it is created in
[21:03:05] <beancurd> hesperaux: time am/pm should autoselect if you put in 24h time, pain index should be a dropdown if 0 - 10, and you should tooltip it to say 10=very hurt, 0 = not hurt.
[21:03:39] <hesperaux> ok, noted. thanks
[21:04:13] <beancurd> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[21:04:22] <beancurd> consider using the multi-select from this.
[21:04:31] <beancurd> for the symptoms,
[21:04:41] <hesperaux> ah, nice
[21:05:19] <beancurd> it might be better/easier to select symptoms from a list, rether than manually type them out/add new input boxes.
[21:05:45] <hesperaux> the symptoms are going to be in a list (going to use your page as a guide for that too now)
[21:05:53] <hesperaux> the input boxes are to insert new ones into the database
[21:06:02] <hesperaux> any suggestions for that?
[21:06:02] <beancurd> fair enough.
[21:06:11] <beancurd> insertion of new ones?
[21:06:26] <hesperaux> that will use an ajax call, so maybe it's best to only have one "new symptom" at a time anyway
[21:06:33] <hesperaux> yes
[21:07:21] <beancurd> hmm..
[21:09:01] <beancurd> what you might be able to do is, have a typeable area, if match is found, adds to list, if match is not found, prompt to add a new one. click 'ok' add new symptom.
[21:09:22] <hesperaux> that sounds great to me
[21:09:26] <hesperaux> that'll be tough to code
[21:09:38] <hesperaux> i'm stuck with no knowledge of best practices
[21:10:01] <beancurd> i guess you should have backup button/input box somewhere close by for people who just use the dropdown and don't find their symptom.
[21:10:01] <hesperaux> just started learning this. i'm using a mojolicious backend but i'm new to JS/ajax
[21:10:12] <beancurd> ah.
[21:10:26] <beancurd> stick to what you know, one step at a time.
[21:11:09] <beancurd> imo, just make it work, show it to the world, and have them abuse you til you get better.
[21:11:41] <hesperaux> lol :)
[21:11:54] <hesperaux> this is mainly as a practice for work, and it happens to help my g/f if it does the job
[21:11:58] <aghouseh> beancurd: not select2?
[21:12:07] <hesperaux> doing some webapp stuff for work now
[21:12:14] <aghouseh> select2 is based off of chosen and adds a lot of nice functionality
[21:12:16] <beancurd> of course, you should comment your stuff, and indent well, and have sensible variable names.
[21:12:47] <hesperaux> beancurd, once i write something that i'm actually gonna use, i definitely will
[21:12:53] <hesperaux> this is just messing around for now :D
[21:15:39] <Lann> How can I refer to "this" here? $( ".accordion" ).accordion({active: ($(this).hasClass('expanded') ? true : false), /* Collapsed by default unless style expanded present */ ...
[21:15:52] <Lann> the $(this) doesn't seem to do what i'm trying to do
[21:16:11] <beancurd> aghouseh: i wasn't aware of select2. :) thnx for pointing it out.
[21:16:27] <aghouseh> yup np! i love chosen and harvest, but select2 is the evolution
[21:17:56] <hesperaux> does chosen/select2 work on mobile browsers?
[21:18:04] <hesperaux> i'd like to stick with something that works on everything
[21:24:12] <beancurd> hesperaux: yep. sort of.
[21:24:28] <hesperaux> beancurd, i'll load the select2 page and see what works and what doesn't i guess
[21:24:30] <shoky> Lann: do you have multiple .accordion's?
[21:24:34] <hesperaux> (on my android phone or w/e)
[21:24:42] <Lann> shoky: yes
[21:24:59] <beancurd> hesperaux: it's not exactly friendly, since it's a selectbox that needs typing.
[21:25:10] <beancurd> and you want to avoid typing on mobile devices if you can.
[21:25:13] <shoky> Lann: ok then use:  see ?each
[21:25:13] <bot-t> Lann, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[21:25:37] <hesperaux> beancurd, i'll probably use the selectbox for it instead, and have an alternate stylesheet that changes the size of the UI
[21:26:23] <shoky> Lann: $(".accordion").each(function() { var el = $(this); el.accordion({active: el.hasClass('expanded'), ...}) })
[21:26:52] <beancurd> you can set meta viewport/zoom to stop the silly zoomin thing iirc.
[21:26:58] <beancurd> on mobile devices.
[21:27:00] <Lann> thanks
[21:27:13] <hesperaux> beancurd, good to know. that is a mostly annoying feature hehe
[21:28:00] <beancurd> you can write some js to not load the plugin if mobile device found.
[21:29:22] <hesperaux> alright
[21:29:27] <hesperaux> well i gotta get to bed now
[21:29:33] <hesperaux> thanks for your help all =)
[21:38:39] <CapMax> is there a name for that effect/thing where if you hover over something a floating div with an image pops up and follows your mouse until you move it out of the target area?
[21:38:50] <beancurd> tooltip?
[21:49:47] <defaultro> hey folks, I have this code - http://jsfiddle.net/m5snm
[21:50:16] <defaultro> I have a global variable called removeObject
[21:50:49] <defaultro> I would like to make additionaldesc required when removeObject is set to true
[21:51:05] <defaultro> right now, it's hardcoded as required
[21:55:53] <Chocs> Could anyone please help me with a really stupid problem: I'll paste my example here.
[21:56:22] <shoky> defaultro: var obj = {}; if (removeObject) obj.required = whatever;     ?
[21:56:58] <shoky> Chocs: hope you mean in a pastebin
[21:57:09] <shoky> or fiddle
[21:57:41] <Chocs> shoky (similar nick): yes, right!
[21:58:10] <Chocs> http://pastebin.com/cJXU3wcz
[21:58:16] <defaultro> ok shoky
[21:59:42] <shoky> Chocs:   if(tabledtaxid = taxid)
[21:59:53] <shoky> i hope i don't need to elaborate
[22:02:05] <Chocs> my apologies shoky, but you might if you could be so kind - it looked right to me - I'm imaging you understand my problem: essentially I'm getting every iteration of the two variables, whereas what I want is just the iteration that matches
[22:02:10] <Chocs> http://pastebin.com/8NA0YrjU
[22:02:33] <shoky> Chocs:  what does = do?
[22:03:37] <shoky> var x;   x = 7;
[22:03:46] <Chocs> ahhhhhh....  it sets
[22:03:56] <Chocs> I need == ?
[22:04:09] <Chocs> (sorry for the noobiness)
[22:04:12] <shoky> that depends, what does == do?
[22:04:25] <shoky> it also depends on what you WANT to do ;]
[22:04:31] <Chocs> comparison?
[22:04:34] <Chocs> :-)
[22:04:56] <shoky> what does your javascript book/professor/experience say?
[22:05:13] <shoky> if you have none of those, get one :p
[22:05:24] <shoky> maybe im missing a 4th option or smth ;p
[22:05:45] <Chocs> I want my if to stop on taxid=tabledtaxid - and I'm working on the experience part right now, the book and professor shall follow
[22:06:27] <shoky> ?learn @ Chocs
[22:06:27] <bot-t> Chocs, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:07:03] <shoky> === would be best.
[22:08:26] <getschomp545> bot-t: jquery is much easier to grasp than JS.
[22:08:27] <bot-t> getschomp545, Changed "jquery".
[22:08:30] <Michael_> Can't access api.jquery.com/api now!!!!  Does anyone know about it?
[22:08:36] <wroathe> as in shoky === 'dirtywhore'
[22:08:39] <getschomp545> i would recommend jquery before JS
[22:08:42] <shoky> ;D
[22:08:44] <shoky> ?botsnack
[22:08:44] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[22:08:46] <wroathe> which of course returns true
[22:09:00] <shoky> ;]
[22:09:00] <Chocs> thank you +bot-t (you're absolutely right) and shoky - I will more than happily spend the following weeks and month learning
[22:09:07] <Chocs> buy
[22:09:10] <Chocs> but
[22:09:28] <Chocs> I'm just really in a jam, so my apologies for asking dumb questions :-)
[22:09:40] <shoky> Chocs: <shoky> === would be best.   ;]
[22:10:22] <Michael_> api.jquery.com/api is not available now. Any suggestion?
[22:10:30] <shoky> google cache
[22:10:37] <shoky> tho..
[22:10:41] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com
[22:10:48] <Chocs> yes - I just tried that shoky, and I'm not getting anything             if(tabledtaxid === taxid) {
[22:10:49] <wroathe> Chocs: So what's the question?
[22:10:50] <shoky> works fine
[22:10:58] <defaultro> if form.validate a jquery thing?
[22:11:07] <Michael_> i mean api.jquery.com/api not api.jquery.com
[22:11:14] <shoky> a thing?
[22:11:20] <defaultro> i mean, part of jquery
[22:11:24] <defaultro> validate
[22:11:27] <shoky> what's api.jquery.com/api ?
[22:11:30] <shoky> defaultro: no
[22:11:39] <defaultro> k
[22:12:17] <Chocs> wroathe : my question is basically how do I get my if/else to stop on the correct iteration based on  http://pastebin.com/cJXU3wcz and  http://pastebin.com/8NA0YrjU
[22:12:23] <Michael_> http://api.jquery.com/api is the jquery api which is displayed in xml format.
[22:12:48] <shoky> o
[22:12:52] <shoky> shrugs
[22:12:52] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
[22:13:13] <Michael_> but when i access it, i just got 404.
[22:13:33] <Chocs> wroathe : follow up, although it's getting my variables correctly, It doesn't seem to be picking up the correct tabledcounter value
[22:13:45] <Michael_> does jquery ban the http://api.jquery.com/api?
[22:15:53] <tw2113> huh
[22:15:55] <Michael_> Does any can help me? I want to update my translation of jQuery doc to the newest version 1.9.0. but i can't access http://api.jquery.com/api know. I used to access that url to get the document that i should translate.
[22:16:16] <trinadh> Chocs: its getting correct tabledtaxid..?
[22:16:44] <Chocs> trinadh - yes, both variables comme through great
[22:16:46] <tw2113> Michael_, i know they recently revamped the site, so it may not be there any more
[22:17:24] <Chocs> it's just that when the "if" stops because tabletaxid equals taxid, it's picking up a seemingly random tablecounter
[22:18:59] <Chocs> hence I think my questions is more geared around how to sync those variable up - an array?
[22:19:02] <Michael_> Thanks tw2113. that means i can't access that url any more?
[22:19:17] <tw2113> most likely, given that the url gives me 404 as well
[22:20:12] <Michael_> ok. i've got it. Thanks anyway. tw2113.
[22:22:53] <shoky> Chocs: what do you mean by "stops"
[22:23:25] <Chocs> I mean returns true and then executing the two lines below it
[22:24:02] <shoky> it's true when its not supposed to be?
[22:24:10] <shoky> and you changed it to ===  yea?
[22:24:14] <Chocs> yes
[22:24:17] <Chocs> and since then
[22:24:27] <Chocs> it hasn't been coming back true
[22:24:32] <shoky> what..
[22:24:39] <Chocs> which is weird because they were matching up before
[22:24:44] <shoky> i dont care what happened with =
[22:24:48] <shoky> just with ===
[22:24:58] <shoky> so its FALSE when its not supposed to be..??
[22:25:21] <Chocs> yes
[22:25:30] <Chocs> I think that's a better way
[22:25:33] <Chocs> to put it :-)
[22:26:10] <Chocs> I put in a debugger; but nothing
[22:26:21] <shoky> nothing?
[22:26:43] <Chocs> well it's not coming back true, so it's not executing debugger;
[22:27:19] <shoky> then put debugger somewhere where it WILL get executed..
[22:27:22] <shoky> and.. debug
[22:28:57] <shoky> in your sample html i dont see anywhere where those two attributes are equal..
[22:29:54] <Chocs> they are actually, at the beginning and at the end of that sample HTML file
[22:30:05] <Chocs> I put in the debug
[22:30:29] <Chocs> and from what I can tell, I don't think it's actually reading the "taxid" variable from within that if
[22:37:53] <Chocs> again my apologies for the noobiness
[22:38:35] <trinadh> Chocs: remove return false
[22:39:07] <trinadh> Chocs: http://fiddle.jshell.net/vY5wR/
[22:40:31] <Chocs> yes!  thank you so much trinadh !
[22:40:42] <Chocs> exactly what was needed
[22:40:53] <MacWinner> any suggestions on charting/graphing library for use with jquery 1.8.3?.. i'm looking at jqplot and flot
[22:40:56] <Chocs> many, many thanks for saving me... big time
[22:42:14] <trinadh> welcome..
[22:49:56] <toke|1> lol javascriptkilledjesus.com
[23:16:42] <twisted`> how can I detect if a portion of a website or an element has been displayed?
[23:20:11] <kerozene> twisted`: sikuli
[23:21:47] <Whirl3d> I just heard that the department of homeland security in the US advises that all US Citizens remove java from their PCs...Will there be any backlash with javascript?
[23:22:02] <twisted`> Whirl3d: it has nothing to do with each other
[23:22:12] <Whirl3d> I know they are two different things, but the general public doesn;t
[23:22:30] <Whirl3d> I have had 3 customers call to find out if we can stop using javascript on their sites. LOL
[23:22:31] <twisted`> general public doesn't know what javascript is in the first place
[23:22:47] <twisted`> and if they do and they ask those questions
[23:22:50] <kerozene> Whirl3d: switch to coffeescript
[23:22:51] <twisted`> charge 'em 2x as much
[23:24:16] <kerozene> or better still, ecmascript
[23:26:17] <mindis|wurk> bah. .resizables containment option is pretty damn weak
[23:30:07] <Nebros> good morning. i have a lazy page... There are no pictures on it, only 5 tables. they load value out of 2 diffrent databases, BAAN and Notes. the Notes server is the lame problem. atm the page loads all data and then it displays all together. how can i change this? i mean when a table is loaded, it have to disply it directly... is there a js exist for that?
[23:47:51] <mindis|wurk> i never would've guessed how many problems updating jquery could cause within the same 1.8.x branch
[23:56:22] <czytacz> hi, anyone ever worked with flip! plugin?
