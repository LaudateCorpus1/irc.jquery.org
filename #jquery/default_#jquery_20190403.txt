[01:04:42] <nick1> hi i am adding an element on load to the DOM and then in a separate function i want to remove the element
[01:05:11] <robertmaxrees> OK?
[01:05:25] <nick1> lol sorry slowly forming my thought
[01:05:38] <nick1> i'll create a fiddle
[01:13:19] <nick1> okay not sure if i included all the relevant pieces here: https://jsfiddle.net/h0wudsj2/ basically I am adding an element with class empty-cart on load but then calling $(".empty-cart").remove(); is not working
[01:13:37] <nick1> from my googling seems like i may need to use .on but unsure how to incorporate or if i need it
[01:14:03] <robertmaxrees> err.
[01:14:07] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[01:14:38] <robertmaxrees> first up - any console errors?
[01:16:18] <nick1> no
[01:16:34] <robertmaxrees> second - why arent't you using jquery event bindings instead?
[01:17:19] <nick1> i'm very inexperienced with jquery so i haven't heard of it, i'll look into it
[01:17:26] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec i'll show you.
[01:18:55] <nick1> as in using https://api.jquery.com/load-event/ instead of body onload?
[01:19:31] <robertmaxrees> also:
[01:19:40] <robertmaxrees> that ul is invalid.
[01:19:45] <robertmaxrees> and i'll show you what you need to do
[01:22:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1enz50j8/7/
[01:22:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:22:31] <robertmaxrees> you were binding to elements that didn't yet exist.
[01:23:09] <robertmaxrees> also you misspelled empty ;)
[01:24:27] <robertmaxrees> basically: don't use onclick
[01:24:33] <robertmaxrees> use jquery's .on()
[01:25:02] <robertmaxrees> learn event delegation
[01:25:47] <nick1> thanks this is very helpful
[01:26:39] <nick1> was something like onclick= in an element an older method?
[01:26:49] <robertmaxrees> very antiquated.
[01:27:29] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[01:27:46] <robertmaxrees> anyway, good luck :)
[02:41:22] <Histogun> hello room
[02:43:32] <Histogun> anyone can help me plz
[02:48:51] <Histogun> stucked with infinty loop ajax call with timeout
[03:07:22] <Histogun> function load() {           $.ajax({ 			cache:false, 			async : true,             url: "https://intranet.algerian-radio.dz/feed.php",             type: "GET",             success: function (result) { $("#bn4").empty(); 			   $("#newsTicker15").remove();                              },             complete: load         }).done(function (result) { 						                    $("#bn4").append(result);  		}).always(function () {         s
[03:09:40] <Cork> don't dump larg scripts in the channel, make a jsfiddle
[03:12:41] <Histogun> sorry for that : https://jsfiddle.net/xna9sydg/
[03:15:35] <Cork> "complete: load" your calling load twice
[03:15:46] <Cork> one always and one after 7 seconds from always
[03:16:10] <Cork> i would recommend removing success and complete and only use .done and .always
[03:23:49] <Histogun>  Cork i do that now, but my div not replaced with new value from feed.php
[03:24:25] <Cork> i would recommend adding an .fail(function() {}) and check so the server doens't return an error
[03:24:41] <Cork> alternatively make sure the selector actually finds the bn4 id
[03:26:22] <Histogun>  Cork its oky now, but i have a memory leak domnode growing
[03:26:43] <Cork> again you have to make sure you don't have a global variable holding reference to the dom elements
[03:26:50] <Cork> i told you this yesterday
[03:27:13] <Cork> also, async : true, <-- don't do this
[03:27:27] <Histogun>  Cork i changed my script from yesterday
[03:27:45] <Cork> ya, but if you get memory leaks it meas you hold a reference somwhere
[03:28:42] <Histogun>  Cork in my file feed.php i have a echo in, because of that?
[03:29:08] <Cork> memory usage in the client has nothing to do with that the server does
[03:29:21] <Cork> except for possibly temporarly cause of response size
[03:29:39] <Cork> if you get a constantly increesing memory, you hold reference to old things somewhere
[03:30:45] <Histogun>  Cork any idea how i can find that with devtools of firefox?
[03:31:11] <Cork> Histogun: not easily, you need to know your page
[03:31:29] <Histogun>  Cork  i know that
[03:32:03] <Cork> memory usage can give you hints, but you have to know where you call what and look at where those usage are
[03:32:30] <Cork> (and i can only give you very generic hints without debugging the page)
[03:32:50] <Histogun>  Cork oky no problem, thank you so much
[03:32:58] <Cork> np
[03:33:02] <Histogun>  Cork https://jsfiddle.net/z27javLk/ my code of page feed.php
[03:33:54] <Cork> have you checked so it isn't breakingNews causing it?
[03:34:10] <Cork> those news tickers tend to consume a ton of memory last i looked at one
[03:34:33] <Histogun>  Cork just 3mb of script but not growing
[03:34:56] <Cork> well then you will have to look further
[03:35:25] <Histogun> if i put the newsticker in another page, just 3mb size of memory, not growing,
[03:38:30] <Histogun>  Cork any idea how i can empty my div before calling again ajax?
[03:49:08] <Cork> Histogun: .empty() or .html('') (same thing)
[05:00:55] <Histogun>  Cork thank you, i used that, but the same result, domnode growing memoryleak
[05:39:14] <Cork> Histogun: you have to figure out what is increasing in memory
[05:39:20] <Cork> and what you're referencing
[05:39:26] <Cork> (all over the page)
[05:41:05] <Histogun>  Cork i know where the div with id bn4 after call ajax in 40sec, domnode growing and growing
[05:41:51] <Cork> Histogun: how are you adding the new results to the div?
[05:42:04] <Histogun> Cork:  i Call with ajax feed.php the result in the div bn4
[05:43:25] <Cork> i don't care what you get it from, but how do you add it to the dom?
[05:45:17] <Histogun> Cork: the feed file php : https://jsfiddle.net/8acunrp5/
[05:46:03] <Histogun>  Cork : with$("#bn4").append(result);
[05:46:47] <Cork> try using .html() instead of .append
[05:57:45] <Histogun>  Cork : i used that now, domnod growing slowly but not like append : https://jsfiddle.net/y6rosvbk/
[05:58:01] <Cork> Histogun: you will have to look into what your doing
[05:58:54] <Histogun>  Cork thank you for helping so much
[06:01:11] <Histogun>  Cork have a good day
[06:01:16] <Cork> same
[13:33:00] <khobo> thykka:
[13:33:03] <khobo> you around?
[13:33:20] <MassDebates> moar like thicc-a
[13:35:06] <robertmaxrees> khobo if you have a question you can just ask it out to the channel ;)
[13:35:25] <khobo> oooo what's up robertmaxrees
[13:35:32] <khobo> social crewwww
[13:35:39] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:35:50] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees isn't social
[13:35:55] <MassDebates> he's a cyborg
[13:36:06] <MassDebates> p sure he's more circuitboards than blood vessels at this point
[13:36:44] <khobo> lol

[13:37:27] <khobo> http://tinyurl.com/y52hw5mu
[13:37:36] <khobo> hit resize around 1050 for hamburger menu
[13:37:39] <khobo> fire it
[13:37:46] <khobo> and notice how the content shifts due to teh scrollbars disappearing?
[13:37:59] <khobo> i had this fixed once but I can't remember what I did to freeze it
[13:37:59] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:38:06] <khobo> have we talked abotu this before?
[13:38:11] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/j10dxypm/
[13:38:13] <khobo> that's the JS
[13:38:19] <robertmaxrees> 2 things:
[13:38:56] <robertmaxrees> 1: make a simplified jsfiddle of the problem.  isolated test cases are 1000x easier than an entire page.
[13:39:49] <robertmaxrees> 2: why do you even need to disable scroll in the first place?
[13:40:13] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/j10dxypm/1/
[13:40:22] <khobo> because the scroll looks terrible when it goes full res
[13:40:29] <khobo> since you're able to scroll down and nothing happens
[13:41:17] <khobo> i think the fix is to do a window size call
[13:41:23] <khobo> and some kind of calc function to - .9rem
[13:41:31] <khobo> since that's the width of the scrollbar
[13:41:34] <khobo> but im just guessing
[13:42:12] <khobo> i mean i wouldn't mind if i just came in from the leftside
[13:42:19] <khobo> that'd fix it and might be a lot simpler?
[13:42:28] <khobo> na maybe not actually
[13:43:23] <robertmaxrees> jfc slow down.
[13:43:34] <robertmaxrees> you know you can type more than half a sentence at a time, right?
[13:43:59] <khobo> cool cool
[13:44:00] <robertmaxrees> and that fiddle is not an isolated test case.  you literally just copy/pasted the entire page.
[13:45:18] <robertmaxrees> and finally: have you even looked at the page on a real mobile device?
[13:45:32] <robertmaxrees> or in a mobile emulator
[13:47:06] <khobo> yeah looks a lot better on mobile no jump
[13:47:17] <robertmaxrees> don't solve problems you won't have :)
[17:07:19] <benne> hi i need help makin a function to load files into a specific div on clickin on a link
[17:07:36] <benne> then a need another function thats load stuff to another div
[17:07:44] <benne> thats what i got trouble withjh
[17:07:56] <benne> i got a function that loads stuff to a div
[17:08:07] <benne> but cnt get it to load into a second div
[17:09:16] <robertmaxrees>  ok?
[17:09:27] <robertmaxrees> care to share the code in a fiddle or paste?
[17:10:59] <robertmaxrees> benne
[17:11:16] <benne> sec
[17:13:31] <benne> robertmaxrees https://pastebin.com/m9YU9ka2
[17:14:03] <benne> as you see the functions are the same exept  seconf function has #login as taERGET
[17:14:14] <robertmaxrees> ew pastebin :(
[17:14:28] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[17:14:38] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[17:14:55] <benne> dopnt know hoe too call them individual
[17:15:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[17:15:13] <benne> top call function i add rel='tab' in the <a>
[17:15:31] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:15:38] <benne> but changing tab to tab2 in second functiuon dont dont work
[17:16:06] <robertmaxrees> guess i'm not clear with what this is trying to do.
[17:16:13] <robertmaxrees> you have two event handlers bound to the same elements.
[17:16:49] <robertmaxrees> can you make a jsfiddle and show your html as well?
[17:23:04] <benne> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/qcgbtxw3/
[17:23:18] <benne> think thats correct not sure tho
[17:23:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1dypvow2/
[17:23:44] <robertmaxrees> this is what you wanted
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> okay so what doesn't work here?
[17:24:43] <benne> ohh noo its wrong
[17:24:59] <benne> ther should be a div with id="login"
[17:25:07] <robertmaxrees> there is.
[17:25:27] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/d1wVHr9.png
[17:25:36] <benne> oh
[17:26:00] <robertmaxrees> let's simplify this real quick.
[17:26:06] <benne> k
[17:27:03] <robertmaxrees> so pull it back to this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1dypvow2/4/
[17:27:13] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?  that clicking on the tab2 doesn't work?
[17:28:03] <robertmaxrees> benne
[17:28:44] <benne> pressing the second ttest dont work in your link :P
[17:28:52] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't work in yours either./
[17:29:05] <robertmaxrees> because you don't have any event handler bound to it.
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> you're doing $("a[rel='tab']").click(function(e) { twice.
[17:29:23] <robertmaxrees> that's only binding to the first one, not the second.
[17:30:02] <benne> still dont understand would you be so kind you write the soulution for me? :]
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> hjeh
[17:30:11] <robertmaxrees> you gotta figure it out yourself ;)
[17:30:20] <robertmaxrees> so think about it.
[17:30:27] <robertmaxrees> <a href="login.php" rel="tab">test</a> works - rel="tab"
[17:30:33] <robertmaxrees> but the other one is rel="tab2"
[17:31:00] <robertmaxrees> if you look at your js, you're selecting $("a[rel='tab']") in both cases.
[17:31:23] <robertmaxrees> you never select tab2
[17:32:09] <benne> <a href="test.html" rel="tab2">test2</a>
[17:32:15] <benne> loads both
[17:32:23] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "loads both"?
[17:32:29] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't select tab2
[17:32:32] <benne> i tried that beforee i ask4de fr help :P
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> tried what?
[17:32:39] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[17:32:53] <benne> https://jsfiddle.net/xbzcmf5w/
[17:33:14] <robertmaxrees> and that works :)
[17:33:19] <benne> tvbh i dont know anythin about jquery
[17:33:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up http://learn.jquery.com/  then
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> solid overview.
[17:34:31] <benne> oh yeah i guess it did, but if you press test first its shows 'ä'foo' then test2 its just adds 'login'
[17:34:44] <benne> wont that fuck it all up when you add links
[17:34:45] <robertmaxrees> so then what do you want it to do instead?
[17:35:50] <benne> sec
[17:38:38] <benne> lets say i set a href="www.google.se" to the first link and a href="www.udemy.com" to the second link
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle duder :)
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> don't make me try to visualize what's in your head.
[17:39:29] <benne> https://jsfiddle.net/xbzcmf5w/1/
[17:39:36] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:39:45] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want to have happen when you click on a link?
[17:39:56] <benne> oipen in in the div
[17:40:01] <robertmaxrees> in what div?
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> like, what links #login to tab2?
[17:40:27] <benne> if pressing first link it should open in col-md-6 and second link in #login
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> why??
[17:41:03] <robertmaxrees> there's no inherent relationship between the two, so it's kind of hard to arbitrarily link them.
[17:41:40] <benne> dont know what that means
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> what links tab to col-md-6 ?
[17:42:36] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can do this all with a single event listener and some data attributes.
[17:42:41] <robertmaxrees> so i'd give that a shot.
[17:43:18] <benne> https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_events.asp ?
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> i linked you to the jquery learning center - i'd start with that instead of w3schools
[17:54:09] <benne> cant find anything about listener onhttps://api.jquery.com/
[17:54:16] <robertmaxrees> and again
[17:54:22] <robertmaxrees> i linked you to the jquery learning center
[17:54:42] <benne> http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[17:54:43] <benne> still
[17:54:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:55:01] <robertmaxrees> start there :)
[17:55:01] <benne> no result when typin listen in the find field
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:55:37] <robertmaxrees> either way, start on that page.
[17:56:19] <benne> dont got time to start learning a nw language from start
[17:56:27] <robertmaxrees> it's not a language :)
[17:56:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a library.
[17:57:40] <benne> was looking for a simple öquick solution
[17:58:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to point you in the right direction.
[18:05:24] <benne> screw it i give up im to stoopid
[18:05:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not stupid.
[18:05:47] <robertmaxrees> just gotta learn to walk before you can run
[18:07:44] <benne> isnt it possable to use the onclick() function somehow?
[18:07:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:08] <robertmaxrees> you're already using jquery's event binding
[18:08:12] <robertmaxrees> why would you go backwards?
[18:10:36] <benne> that event listening to ake any sense to me
[18:10:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:11:09] <benne> nevermind i start from beginning, translating the site into swedish maby thats easssier
[18:11:18] <robertmaxrees> ... lol
[18:11:51] <benne> $( "#list a" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
[18:11:51] <benne>     event.preventDefault();
[18:11:51] <benne>     console.log( $( this ).text() );
[18:11:51] <benne> });
[18:12:01] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code into the channel :)
[18:12:11] <robertmaxrees> use a fiddle.
[18:14:27] <benne> do i need to use ajax
[18:14:30] <benne> also?
[18:14:49] <robertmaxrees> since i'm not entirely clear about what you're trying to build, i have no idea.
[18:14:53] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to build?
[18:17:38] <benne> i got a programming urse im hosting and we need a website soo im tryin to mke one with all the functions we need. it look likes this http://94.254.100.14/bootstrap2/index.php buts thats notthe latest version got that one on another compure
[18:17:43] <benne> computer
[18:18:11] <robertmaxrees> wait
[18:18:18] <robertmaxrees> you're hosting a programming course?
[18:18:39] <benne> y
[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> good luck with that.
[18:19:06] <benne> not jquery/ajhax related tho
[18:19:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:19:39] <benne> actallly were already done with it. last meeting this monday
[18:19:53] <robertmaxrees> :|
[20:23:52] <arooni> is there a better alternative for : https://github.com/jquery-backstretch/jquery-backstretch to lazily load images that i want to have set to the background of a page?  if i'm already using jquery?
