[04:18:13] <sine0> morning chaps and possibly chappettes, whats the term for when you switch jQuery to $ or something else
[04:23:48] <thykka> creating a reference?
[04:24:07] <thykka> or rather.. assigning a reference
[04:24:35] <thykka> it's pretty much just var $ = jQuery;
[04:25:12] <thykka> unless using the noConflict method
[04:50:49] <sine0> ok
[04:51:13] <sine0> but jQuery should always hit it even if someone or a theme in wp case has assigned a reference
[04:54:18] <Cork> sine0: as long as they haven't called noConflict ya
[04:54:37] <Cork> wp as far as i know call noConflict by default
[04:54:53] <Cork> (hence ppl normally use jQuery instead)
[05:30:52] <sine0> roger that
[05:40:56] <sine0> something unrelated, I have started to play with some jquery plugins, one of them being isotope which uses masonry for images, sometimes the page is slow to load the images are not set its like its broken. what do I use to make sure this works, do I have to make it the last thing to load or is there another way of making sure everythign is complete. i noticed on a one site there were some classes called
[05:41:02] <sine0> lazyload not sure if its related
[05:45:23] <Cork> sine0: if i remember correctly it has a callback to handle image loading
[05:47:06] <sine0> oh cool will check
[11:23:23] <LucaVanzin> hello, I have created an object literal with 2 date properties inside, the later in a function I would like to assign some value to these properties, but the assignation doesn't work.. Could you explain me where i'm wrong please? https://pastebin.com/Tpf4hxcK   Thankyou
[11:24:05] <robertmaxrees> where is onOffDate1 defined vs the assignments?  when you say "doesn't work", do you mean you're getting an error?
[11:24:29] <LucaVanzin> No I get a minimum date
[11:24:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd need more code then.
[11:25:40] <LucaVanzin> https://pastebin.com/PNj9kwfR  Some function are stripped out
[11:26:47] <LucaVanzin> I don't know if is a food practice to return either a string or the object literal conform to a conditional result.. but i'm not really skilled in jquery
[11:26:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[11:27:08] <robertmaxrees> so a few things jumpo out as odd
[11:27:11] <robertmaxrees> *jump
[11:27:49] <robertmaxrees> unrelated, but why do you have a $(function() { nested in a $(document).ready( function() { ??
[11:27:58] <LucaVanzin> I'm not surprised if this code is a bad code
[11:28:10] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you define onOffDate1 outside of parse_on_off_time?
[11:28:58] <LucaVanzin> Q1: because I learned this from the only course I followed... I though is a convention
[11:29:14] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { is short for $(document).ready( function() {
[11:29:28] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing a document ready within a document ready :)
[11:29:30] <LucaVanzin> Q2 I need to use  onOffDate1 also outside the function
[11:30:27] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you console.log within parse_on_off_time?
[11:30:34] <LucaVanzin> could I use  onOffDate1 as a typedef? (maybe improper sentence since I learned jquery is not typed...
[11:30:36] <robertmaxrees> console.log onOffDate1, i mean
[11:30:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language.
[11:30:44] <robertmaxrees> javascript is.
[11:30:52] <robertmaxrees> and javascript doesn't do typedefs.
[11:31:11] <LucaVanzin> I get this {on: "Thu Feb 28 2019 17:19:28 GMT+0100 (Ora standard dell’Europa centrale)", off: "Thu Feb 28 2019 17:19:28 GMT+0100 (Ora standard dell’Europa centrale)"}
[11:31:20] <robertmaxrees> is that what you're looking for?
[11:31:40] <robertmaxrees> without a functioning jsfiddle it's hard to know what the issue is.
[11:31:51] <LucaVanzin> yes I want to return 2 dates (in reality 2 time of day)
[11:32:12] <robertmaxrees> okay so the console.log within the function works, but outside it doesn't?
[11:33:02] <LucaVanzin> it just not perform the assignement         onOffDate1.on = timeOn;
[11:33:03] <LucaVanzin>         onOffDate1.off = timeOff;. It always return the Date (0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
[11:33:42] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming that?
[11:33:55] <robertmaxrees> without a functioning example i'm having to rely on your description ehh
[11:33:57] <robertmaxrees> *heh
[11:34:53] <LucaVanzin> if I change the assignement to new Date() I get this in the console
[11:34:54] <LucaVanzin> {on: Thu Feb 28 2019 17:34:09 GMT+0100 (Ora standard dell’Europa centrale), off: Thu Feb 28 2019 17:34:09 GMT+0100 (Ora standard dell’Europa centrale)}
[11:35:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[11:35:32] <robertmaxrees> Date is a constructor - need to use new in front of it.
[11:35:44] <LucaVanzin> so i thing I have some problems in my variables
[11:36:21] <robertmaxrees> just stick the keyword 'new' in front of Date for timeOn and timeOff
[11:36:34] <LucaVanzin> ok I try
[11:37:11] <robertmaxrees> and use curlies for your if/else statements ;) https://bpaste.net/show/e247ef1eb0e1
[11:38:59] <LucaVanzin> OK.. It worked.. very kind and useful, thankyou.
[11:39:15] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery isn't a programming languge :)
[11:39:23] <robertmaxrees> just fyi
[11:39:28] <LucaVanzin> last question.. is bat to mix return objects like string and object literal?
[11:39:35] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[11:39:54] <robertmaxrees> you should consistently return one type./
[11:40:23] <LucaVanzin> could you tell me best practice? maybe I can show an alert in the function and then return a null or a fake date?
[11:40:32] <robertmaxrees> erm
[11:40:42] <LucaVanzin> erm? sorry
[11:41:06] <robertmaxrees> no - you need some kind of intermediary function that should check if your data is valid
[11:41:18] <robertmaxrees> and if not, branch from there from within that click handler
[11:41:29] <robertmaxrees> only call parse_on_off_time if you have a valid on/off time to parse.
[11:41:53] <robertmaxrees> also: don't have a global state var while also returning it from the function that modifies it.
[11:41:55] <robertmaxrees> pick one or another.
[11:42:42] <LucaVanzin> ok.. so I have to definie that variable 2 times, also inside the function?
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?  no.
[11:43:27] <LucaVanzin> sorry but I come from a strong typed language.. I'm not used to thys environment
[11:43:45] <robertmaxrees> literally none of what you're asking has naything to do with the type system.
[11:43:50] <robertmaxrees> *anything
[11:45:20] <LucaVanzin> could you kindly tell me if is better to not use global variable inside a function, hot to return somethoing that match the global variable if this variable is an object literal?
[11:45:44] <robertmaxrees> avoid global variables in the first place.
[11:46:48] <LucaVanzin> ok, so if i don't have a type, how to define a new variable where i need?
[11:46:59] <robertmaxrees> agaon.
[11:47:01] <robertmaxrees> js has types.
[11:47:08] <robertmaxrees> it's just dynamically typed.
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need a global var?
[11:47:43] <LucaVanzin> my limit obviously
[11:49:01] <robertmaxrees> 1 se3c.
[11:49:48] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/b17e476ea4e1 untested and unfinished
[11:49:51] <robertmaxrees> but you get the idea.
[11:50:05] <robertmaxrees> using functions is still a good idea in JS.
[11:50:12] <LucaVanzin> and then because I just started yesterday programming jquery
[11:50:21] <robertmaxrees> again
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> jquery is not a language.
[11:50:29] <robertmaxrees> javascript is the language.,
[11:51:26] <LucaVanzin> ok.. please be clement if I'm not used to these terms
[11:51:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:52:02] <LucaVanzin> let me ask one more thing..  thanks for refactoruing my code first
[11:52:10] <robertmaxrees> that's not a complete refactor.
[11:52:16] <robertmaxrees> just a place to get started
[11:52:36] <LucaVanzin> you declared onOffDate1 inside a function
[11:52:41] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[11:52:46] <robertmaxrees> because you want to avoid global vars.
[11:53:24] <robertmaxrees> without seeing examples, it's hard to understand why you think you need some kind of global state.
[11:53:29] <LucaVanzin> what if I need, inside the button.click event, to disassemble the onOffDate1 into 2 separate dates?
[11:53:57] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[11:54:09] <LucaVanzin> yes I understand that you are not aware of my goal
[11:54:39] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "disassemble the onOffDate1 into 2 separate dates"?
[11:55:00] <LucaVanzin> I used an Object literal because I don't know another way to return 2 dates
[11:55:12] <robertmaxrees> you can't return 2 objects from a function
[11:55:23] <robertmaxrees> you can return 1.
[11:55:27] <LucaVanzin> But in the main loop I need to have 2 separate dates, one on and one off
[11:55:53] <robertmaxrees> which my code does.
[11:56:09] <robertmaxrees> well, can do.
[11:56:10] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[11:56:43] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/16f85a698f8a
[11:57:14] <robertmaxrees> again, not complete.
[11:57:16] <robertmaxrees> but you get the idea.
[12:00:30] <LucaVanzin> ok... may I ask a last?
[12:00:42] <robertmaxrees> lol don't ask to ask - just ask your questions :)
[12:00:59] <LucaVanzin> what type is result?
[12:01:26] <robertmaxrees> the one in the click handler?
[12:01:47] <robertmaxrees> var result = parse_on_off_time(... this one?
[12:01:55] <LucaVanzin> yes: var result = parse_on_off_time(... it can't be onOffDate1
[12:02:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:02:10] <robertmaxrees> what type do you think it is?
[12:02:49] <LucaVanzin> I mean... could I assign var on = result.on;  ?
[12:03:00] <robertmaxrees> have you tried?
[12:03:10] <LucaVanzin> hehe.. not yet
[12:03:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:03:23] <robertmaxrees> try first instead of asking if you can.
[12:03:34] <robertmaxrees> if it breaks and you can't figure out why, then ask.
[12:03:37] <LucaVanzin> better I go to do something ;p
[12:11:17] <LucaVanzin> Uhm... it works.. and I don't understand under what principle
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[12:12:48] <LucaVanzin> I can access result.on and result.off but the type was defined inside a function.. so I argue is out of scope... the only way I can think is possible is that result Inherit the type other than the values
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:13:05] <robertmaxrees> show me what you mean.
[12:13:23] <robertmaxrees> i think you're really confused about how types in js work.
[12:15:17] <LucaVanzin> var onOffDate1  is defined inside function parse_on_off_time... so for my knowledge of others languages (but jquery does not) it should be out of scope for the otherparts of the program
[12:15:29] <robertmaxrees> and again.
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> jquery is not a programming language.
[12:15:41] <LucaVanzin> Isaid jquery is not a language
[12:16:04] <robertmaxrees> you didn't say that./
[12:16:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:16:07] <LucaVanzin> so I cant grasp this concept
[12:16:22] <robertmaxrees> it's very simple.
[12:17:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vg8keb9z/
[12:17:40] <robertmaxrees> in javascript, whatever you return from a fucntion is what you return.  if you return a number, then it's a number.  if you return a string, it's a string.
[12:17:51] <robertmaxrees> you don't define the type explicitly because you don't need to.
[12:18:01] <robertmaxrees> javascript handles it all for you automatically.
[12:18:32] <LucaVanzin> even if is a not native type?
[12:18:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "native type"?
[12:19:18] <robertmaxrees> that has literally nothing to do with this :)
[12:19:33] <robertmaxrees> if you return a string, it's a string.  if you return an object, it's an object.
[12:19:35] <LucaVanzin> the one I define. let say int or string or double is native.. onOffDate1 I defined so is not native
[12:19:42] <robertmaxrees> you're not defining a type.
[12:19:49] <robertmaxrees> you're declaring an object.
[12:20:40] <LucaVanzin> and js is smart enaught to let me use that object with its properties even if i declared inside a function, from the caller? smart!
[12:20:46] <robertmaxrees> also, js doesn't have int or double - all numerical values use the 'number' type
[12:21:06] <robertmaxrees> you're aware that js doesn't use classes, right?
[12:22:08] <LucaVanzin> nope...
[12:22:14] <LucaVanzin> just started :)
[12:22:27] <LucaVanzin> but I was suspecting that
[12:22:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a prototype-based language.  it has a class keyword, but it's just syntactic sugar for prototypes.
[12:23:15] <robertmaxrees> also: js is dynamically typed.  do you understand the difference between strictly typed and dynamically typed languages?
[12:23:53] <LucaVanzin> I don't know if I will need to fight again with js and jquery but if it happen I will need to get more in deep on this
[12:24:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:24:36] <robertmaxrees> you should learn and understand the differences between static and dynamic type system
[12:24:51] <LucaVanzin> I know c# that is strictly typed and a bit python that is dynamically typed, but never went deep inside python
[12:25:09] <robertmaxrees> still a good concept to understand
[12:25:16] <LucaVanzin> yes.
[12:25:51] <LucaVanzin> anyway I'ts time to go home for me.. really thanks for the time you spent for me robertmaxrees
[12:25:57] <robertmaxrees> sure
[12:27:04] <LucaVanzin> Have a good time ahead.
[12:33:04] <paule32> hello
[12:33:15] <paule32> how can i implement a ast?
[12:33:20] <paule32> i have following code:
[12:33:22] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/218HCE4
[12:33:33] <robertmaxrees> ask in ##javascript
[13:17:54] <impliednude> I need to change ::webkit-scrollbar-track so that way the track size is independent on the content in it and requires less "scrolling" on the track area.
[13:18:13] <impliednude> any plugins to do this?
[13:18:56] <impliednude> or is it even possible without using flash (which I would never do)
[13:21:01] <impliednude> aka if I have an element that has overflow:auto; width: 2000px; I would want ::webkit-scrollbar-track to be 200px but would still show all the content within the element if dragged right or left.
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> then why not set it to 200px?
[13:21:35] <taplar> you may want to check in ##javascript, or checkout a css room
[13:21:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:21:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:21:49] <impliednude> it doesn't work robertmaxrees. and kk taplar
[13:22:20] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't work" as in...?
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery to set it?
[13:22:44] <taplar> i think he's wanting to change the scroll sensativity
[13:22:58] <impliednude> no, I am not using jquery but I figured I would check here before javascript since the project will be in jquery
[13:23:13] <robertmaxrees> ah, jquery's still javascript fwiw :)
[13:23:17] <impliednude> I know
[13:23:21] <taplar> 2000px/200px, each scroll "tick" would scoll 10px
[13:23:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check in #css
[13:24:03] <impliednude> taplar> thing is, the overflow can be far more. the scrollbar element generally tracks left and right of the div.
[13:24:25] <impliednude> but it eventually shows all content within the overflowed div if you drag right and left
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, #css should be able to help you there :)
[20:14:32] <madprops> what happens if i save a dom variable .. and remove it from the dom?
[20:14:46] <madprops> for instance an iframe .. would it keep doing iframe operations in the background?
[22:28:32] <initself> where is the object I clicked in:
[22:28:33] <initself> $("#order_line").on("click", export_to_excel);
[22:28:52] <initself> when i am in function export_to_excel() ?
[22:29:05] <initself> i want to get the id value
[22:29:09] <initself> "order_line"
[22:30:26] <initself> $(this) i bet
[22:30:29] * initself tries.
[22:32:57] * initself has success!
[22:45:21] <gr0undh0g> anyone awake?
[22:51:58] <pavonia> Nope, everybody is sleeping
