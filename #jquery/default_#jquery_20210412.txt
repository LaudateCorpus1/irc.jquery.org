[23:05:13] <Absolum> Though this may be a js question, it might be something I'm doing wrong in Jquery.

[23:05:49] <Absolum> You can see the detailed logs that "TL" is not showing up as a viable position...not sure why?
[23:06:38] <robertmaxrees> Absolum mind clarifying how to replicate?
[23:07:30] <Absolum> So sorry. What an idiot. Click one box to set the destination another box to set the movable element. Select the reference points DEST and SOURCe and click apply.
[23:07:59] <Absolum> It should allow you to align the topCenter of one element with the Bottom Center of another, for example.
[23:08:14] <robertmaxrees> so click one box, then click the other box, then what?
[23:08:36] <robertmaxrees> click apply?
[23:08:44] <Absolum> You'll notice a green and orange border. Orange is the destination (not moving) green is the one that moves.
[23:09:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[23:09:02] <Absolum> From the two inputs for Dest and Source you can pick a reference point
[23:09:03] <robertmaxrees> so back way yp.
[23:09:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm just trying to understand how to easily replicate this. simple "do x, y, z" steps.
[23:09:44] <Absolum> I shouldn't have made this test so complicated. Give me a second to simplify it.
[23:09:57] <robertmaxrees> or just give me basic stpes... :)
[23:14:44] <Absolum> https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/mdRxPpp?editors=1111
[23:14:54] <Absolum> Just click the button labeled JUST CLICK HERE
[23:15:08] <robertmaxrees> lol i just commented out a bunch of the console lots and stuff.
[23:15:12] <robertmaxrees> noticing some strange stuff about this code.
[23:15:29] <robertmaxrees> *console logs
[23:15:44] <Absolum> right. I put those in so I could find the errors for every step
[23:15:54] <robertmaxrees> just use a debugger at that pont :shrug:
[23:16:19] <Absolum> I did. Debugger in VSCode said it was perfect
[23:16:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:16:36] <robertmaxrees> you hooked up vscode to your browser??
[23:16:47] <Absolum> I copied the js to vscode
[23:16:58] <robertmaxrees> ??  then how'd you debug it??
[23:17:10] <Absolum> using the jquery plugin and the debugger.
[23:17:14] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[23:17:24] <robertmaxrees> debugging means you rand the code, set breakponts, etc.
[23:17:46] <robertmaxrees> *ran the code
[23:19:01] <Absolum> The problem is that I couldn't find any problems except that in my positions array, it couldn't find "TL"? the first element in the array? Now it is losing its reference to the source element Cannot ready property left of undefined.
[23:19:49] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.  this.positions isn't what you think it is.
[23:20:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing at least.
[23:20:05] <Absolum> cool what is it then?
[23:20:19] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm, context is proper on that.
[23:20:52] <Absolum> basically positions is the list of predefined acceptable "pos" labels for alignment
[23:20:54] <robertmaxrees> oh hahahaha that's the issue.  what's the index of the first thing in an array? :)
[23:21:14] <Absolum> 0
[23:21:26] <robertmaxrees> what would you get if you did if (0) {
[23:22:00] <Absolum> so positions.indexOf("TL") is returning 0 which is falsey?
[23:22:59] <robertmaxrees> correct.  you need to know if .indexOf('TL') > -1 OR .some(function(theValue) { return theValue === theThing; });
[23:25:59] <robertmaxrees> using a debugger and stepping through the code woulda showed you this suuuper quick btw :)
[23:26:49] <Absolum> Well, unfortunately, that's outside my skillset at this time. I don't even know what yoau re talking bout. I use the debugger in VS Code and it steps through like you suggest, but never finds the problem.
[23:27:11] <robertmaxrees> what debugger are you talking about?
[23:27:29] <robertmaxrees> like, how do you access it?
[23:29:14] <Absolum> From the run menu. It has a sub tab that says Problems. I go by step by step and solve the problems.
[23:29:16] <robertmaxrees> if it's the one in the "run" menu, that won't work unless you managed to hook it up to a browser instance.
[23:29:21] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's not a debugger.
[23:29:24] <robertmaxrees> that's just a linter.
[23:30:03] <robertmaxrees> if you use chrome, check out https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/
[23:35:33] <Absolum> The thing is, I quit. I had a chance to pitch my new alignment concept and thought I could generate a quick mockup to prove the point and I simply can't. Illustrator alignment is destined to suck for all eternity. I have been trying to get the ear of Illustrator devs to show this and I can't even demo the most basic use. It's such a simple concept and I cannot believe the bullshit you have to
[23:35:33] <Absolum> go through to make such a simple thing. Thanks for your help. Officially giving up.
[23:36:25] <robertmaxrees> Okie...
