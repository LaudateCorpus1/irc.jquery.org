[04:30:16] <pepa> ''th:not(:empty), th:not(class="k-header")'
[04:30:29] <pepa> trying to use that as a jquery selector but it's not working
[04:30:32] <pepa> any idea?
[04:35:48] <pavonia> The syntax is wrong, should be :not([class="..."])
[04:36:11] <pavonia> or just ":not(.k-header)"
[05:24:58] <pepa> what if I want to say the th which doesnt have role=columnheader
[05:24:58] <pepa> [11:29]
[05:24:58] <pepa> "th:not(role='columnheader')"
[05:24:58] <pepa> [11:29]
[05:24:58] <pepa> would that do it?
[05:27:09] <pavonia> No, it's the same wrong syntax. Please read about CSS attribute selectors
[05:28:25] <pepa> but a role is not a class
[05:28:37] <pepa> it's just an attribute
[05:30:20] <pavonia> Yes, that's why I said attribute selectos :p
[05:30:47] <pavonia> [attr="value"]
[05:31:34] <pavonia> "class" is a special type of attribute which also has a short-hand syntax with a dot
[05:32:27] <pepa> so if for attribute it's just attr="value" then what I did ir correct
[05:44:43] <pavonia> No, the square brackets are important
[06:11:06] <pepa> would this be correct?              "th:not(:empty):not([title='xxx'])"
[06:27:55] <bboy> Hello guys, I want to do a form that will take a table and arrange it, then I could submit the form with the arrangment. I need some idea on how to accomplish this. Please find the attached link: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/op8jr9hs/2/
[06:38:17] <pepa> how can I select an element which has nothing? like a <label....> </label>
[06:40:10] <bboy> pepa, I'm figuring out how to plan to do this and I need some help
[06:42:10] <bboy> pepa, when I click on move to up. I want it to move up
[06:44:46] <bboy> pepa, the edit and delete I will try to work on that. But only my issue is how to create a sort behavior.
[07:14:58] <Cork> pepa: by nothing do you include or exclude indentations?
[08:08:53] <bboy> Hi guys, I need to fix this code and display the list: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/1z2vjmnc/2/
[08:10:35] <bboy> I don't know what's my mistake
[13:40:30] <Anonamy> hey people is anyone here to help me with a javascript / jquery problem I am facing ??
[13:40:52] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask :)  just ask your question and if somebody can help, they will.
[13:41:42] <Anonamy> ok
[13:41:58] <Anonamy> I am dealing with bootstrap, jquery, and arrays (json?)
[13:42:07] <Anonamy> I have an array that is set up like this
[13:42:48] <Anonamy> [ "cityA" => 12,  "cityB" => 16, "cityC" => 8 ]
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array.
[13:42:54] <Anonamy> keys and values
[13:42:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not even javascript.
[13:43:07] <Anonamy> lol
[13:43:07] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle showing the problem instead :)
[13:43:50] <Anonamy> its too big and has too many includes to put it on jsfiddle sorry
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:43:57] <Anonamy> so the variable is declared like th is
[13:43:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't need the entire page.
[13:44:03] <Anonamy>  var centertreatments = {{ numcentertreatmentslist | json_encode | raw }}
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> not also isn't valid JS...
[13:44:27] <Anonamy> right well I am getting the values from Twig
[13:44:31] <Anonamy> which works !
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> okay...
[13:45:09] <Anonamy> however I need to put the values into the  Bootstrap map that I am rendering on the page
[13:45:38] <Anonamy> the boostrap map works, with default values
[13:45:48] <Anonamy> I need to replace the default values with the values from the array
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> can you show that code in a paste then?
[13:46:01] <Anonamy> yes
[13:46:23] <robertmaxrees> both the functioning one, along with the actual js object you're trying to use.
[13:47:58] <Anonamy> https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/KtrPYG5dBf/
[13:48:17] <robertmaxrees> and what does centers look like?
[13:48:23] <robertmaxrees> what is that object?
[13:48:43] <Anonamy> I have a PHP array that I am passing to Javascript by using Twig
[13:48:53] <robertmaxrees> right, so what is the resunting JS?
[13:49:05] <Anonamy> it is declared like this var centertreatments = {{ numcentertreatmentslist | json_encode | raw }}
[13:49:11] <robertmaxrees> sorry, that doesn't help me.
[13:49:16] <Anonamy> ok let me test again one sec
[13:49:28] <robertmaxrees> i need to know what the actual JS object is since that's what the client is using.
[13:51:04] <Anonamy> ok when I do alert (centers);    I get a popup that says  [object Object]
[13:51:12] <pavonia> Apparently the array may not include sub-arrays
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> console.log(centers) instead.
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> and centers isn't an array.  it's an object.
[13:51:23] <Anonamy> the values do not make it to the page on the bootstrap list
[13:51:50] <Anonamy> alright maybe I need to convert it to an array first ?
[13:51:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:51:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> so long story short - i'm guessing centers is a JS object whose keys represent city names.  that's why Object.keys(centers)[0] works - it's grabbing that specific string.
[13:53:34] <Anonamy> yes I am using the keys as values, and the values as values for the keys
[13:53:49] <robertmaxrees> the version that doesn't work creates an array whose first index is an array of city names.  you might simply need to do categories: Object.keys(centers)
[13:55:43] <Anonamy> works
[13:55:44] <Anonamy> thanks
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> i might do a JS 101 type tutorial fwiw :)
[13:56:20] <Anonamy> I will add it to the list lol
[13:56:43] <Anonamy> still getting over how laravel and octobercms works
[13:57:02] <Anonamy> thanks for the help
[13:57:31] <Anonamy> and I will take your advice and look up "javascript types"
[13:58:07] * pavonia wonders if the project is even using jQuery
[13:58:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah - coming from PHP it's easy to get "arrays" and "objects" confused in JS.
[14:00:46] <Anonamy> pavonia, yeah I am using jquery boostrap datatables
[14:01:29] <robertmaxrees> old version of bootstrap?
[14:03:50] <Anonamy> bootstrap 4 yes
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> gotcha
[14:04:26] <Anonamy> I have a world map and a bunch of other goodies I am trying to populate from values from PHP
[14:52:36] <hdalang> Hi guys, I want to display the list of table using jquery and be able to arrange it when I press move up or move down button
[14:53:43] <robertmaxrees> for starters: "the list of table"?? - mind showing a jsfiddle of what you're working with?
[14:59:17] <robertmaxrees> hdalang
[14:59:54] <hdalang> oh sorry, I'm sorry https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/1z2vjmnc/3/
[15:00:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid JS :/
[15:00:47] <hdalang> jquery
[15:00:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS js.
[15:01:01] <robertmaxrees> that template is broken because it's mutliline.
[15:01:08] <robertmaxrees> see that console error?
[15:01:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yqopu6wz/
[15:02:42] <hdalang> OK, thank
[15:02:44] <hdalang> you
[15:07:08] <robertmaxrees> so for the next part: are you trying to figure out how to make those arrow buttons work?
[15:44:08] <hdalang> I'm sorry robertmaxrees I just saw your message. Yes, I'm trying to make the button work
[15:44:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what have you tried?>
[15:45:33] <hdalang> I will actually try to work on it a little, but if you wanna help it's ok. I'm just going to start working on it
[15:46:05] <robertmaxrees> ... sure?  the format of this channel is usually "i tried doing x and it didn't work - can i get some help?" :)
[15:48:28] <hdalang> OK. Mr. robertmaxrees, Can you give me a hint on how to accomplish this. Do you think it's better to map the changes into a new array and then display the result
[15:49:05] <robertmaxrees> that actually would be your best bet.  find a way to relate reach row back to one of the objects in that array, sort the array, and render it back out.
[15:53:47] <hdalang_> OK. I will check it
