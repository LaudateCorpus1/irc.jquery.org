[00:25:59] <HowardwLo> if i’m changing the color of something with transition, sometimes it doesn’t select the right color. is this a common problem?
[00:26:37] <HowardwLo> if i’m changing the color of an element that has transition: 0.2s, it doesn’t land on the right color when i change it too fast* I should say :)
[00:51:11] <ha_one_more_nick> hello everyone!
[00:53:15] <ha_one_more_nick> I wanted to discuss right code methodology for writing code in jquery.If i have multiple html tags on a page then what should is the right methodology to grab or insert data into them that can be used for further processing?
[00:54:19] <ha_one_more_nick> Do i need to create a class that would do so? but then it would  cause code reuse.Any mvc kind of way to get this done ?

[04:15:30] <midori-rus> Hello there. Could anybody help me? I've made a catalog filter with checkboxes. On change of any checkbox ajax function will be called and reload catalog products. Also there is a 'clear all filters' button in catalog filter which makes all checkboxes unchecked. The problem is when I click clear button, all the checkboxes events onChange calling and 10 or 15 ajax request sends. But I don't want to do that
[04:15:40] <midori-rus> is there any solution?
[04:21:06] <Cork> midori-rus: set a data value on the shared parent of the checkboxes
[04:21:25] <Cork> and when the clear all updates them set that value to indicate that they should not update at all
[04:21:41] <Cork> and when that is done remove the value and trigger a specific update
[04:21:54] <Cork> the simplest solution is to have them all in a form and control it on that element
[04:23:13] <Cork> then you just need a $('#my-form').on('click', ':checkbox', function() { if($('#my-form').data('reset')) { return; } else { $('#my-form').trigger('submit'); }  })
[04:23:22] <Cork> actually
[04:23:31] <Cork> its simpler then that (one min making a fiddle
[04:24:42] <midori-rus> Cork: ok, let I make a fiddle
[04:24:52] <Cork> i'm making one, just give me a min
[04:25:14] <midori-rus> Cork: thank you
[04:30:05] <Cork> midori-rus: https://jsfiddle.net/94cy3ppq/
[04:30:14] <Cork> that is the structure i would recommend
[04:31:12] <Cork> (check the developer console for the output)
[04:36:18] <midori-rus> Cork: Thank you very much. My bad that I call ajax on every changing input, but as I understood that I need to call ajax on form submit
[04:36:33] <Cork> yup
[04:36:39] <Cork> instead of the console.log
[04:50:58] <CaptainMoronic> Hi I'm trying to capture a scrollTop()on scroll but it keeps returning 0. http://www.gustav.be/supablow/activiteit/spouwmuurisolatie Anyone a clue why?
[04:53:09] <Cork> where
[04:53:17] <Cork> as in where is the code
[04:53:47] <CaptainMoronic> Ah line 1906. My bad
[04:53:56] <Cork> 1906??
[04:54:01] <Cork> the file isn't more then 424 lines
[04:54:17] <CaptainMoronic> page.gustav.js
[04:54:30] <Cork> btw <a href="http://www.gustav.be/supablow/ "class="logo"> <-- no space before the class
[04:54:46] <CaptainMoronic> Ah dang nice spot
[04:55:38] <Cork> body isn't scrolled
[04:55:46] <Cork> use $(window).on('scroll'
[04:55:53] <Cork> and window.scrollY
[04:56:07] <Cork> (else you will have problem with cross browser support)
[04:56:13] <CaptainMoronic> Alright I'll give those a shot and I'll get back to you
[05:00:50] <CaptainMoronic> Interestingly enough $(window).on('scroll',... isn't executing. So that would mean the window isn't firing it's scroll event or it isn't scrolling hmm
[05:01:04] <CaptainMoronic> its*
[05:01:12] <Cork> one min i might have been wrong there
[05:01:40] <Cork> hmm
[05:01:49] <Cork> check $(document).on('scroll', function() {})
[05:02:13] <CaptainMoronic> Negative
[05:03:25] <Cork> CaptainMoronic: https://jsfiddle.net/g5gbc8vs/
[05:03:42] <Cork> CaptainMoronic: then it sounds like you aren't scrolling the normal window
[05:04:19] <CaptainMoronic> I'll have to dig a bit deeper then alright thank you anyway
[05:05:39] <Cork> ah, yep you have overflow: auto on body
[05:06:55] <Cork> CaptainMoronic: i would recommend not setting that on body
[05:07:05] <Cork> i don't think it is cross browser
[05:07:25] <Cork> it looks like webkit breaks if you do that
[05:11:33] <CaptainMoronic> Ah yes removing all restrictions on scroll on the body and html fixed it :)
[05:23:08] <tilerendering> I need to display a list of products with picture, description etc. in a div, the products are displayed from left to right, top to bottom. I want to use jquery/jquery-ui for this, and ideally tie that list of products to a javascript array called “products” in which all product attributes (including description + picturelink) are stored. where can I find a good tutorial on how to achieve this ? the jquery-ui documentation is ok, but when it
[05:23:09] <tilerendering> comes to databinding, I have problems with progressing fast. any hints ?
[06:05:55] <baako> hi guys i have a one page site, which some html gets loading on request. The issue i am having is that when a certain page is loaded i set a variable to 1 and when a button is click i set the variable 0, but because people can use the back button on their phone or table or click on other buttons on the application to leave this page. Is they a jquery method which says if a partically html element is not present on the current loaded page, do something?
[06:07:18] <baako> at the moment when you click on the back button to leave the page i have a listener
[06:07:18] <baako> $(document).on('click', '#shoppingbox.container.row.col-md-3.ck_btn_dv', function(){ useaddress = 0; });
[06:07:50] <baako> but they are other wants to leave the html element
[06:51:07] <baako> figured it out

[08:03:46] <Deusdeorum> Does jQuery have something like appending left or right of elements? If not, what would be the proper way to insert something right of something else, creating a table with two cols?
[08:11:20] <Cork> Deusdeorum: there are no right left in dom
[08:11:25] <Cork> there are only before and after
[08:11:48] <Cork> and .before .after provides that
[08:13:03] <Deusdeorum> Cork hm, tried that but couldn't manage to use .after in the proper way. I have 'some text' and a text input field which I would like to place just right of that 'some text'
[08:13:18] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you can't position test
[08:13:20] <Cork> *text
[08:13:26] <Cork> it has to be elements
[08:13:45] <Cork> so you can position <span>some text</span>
[08:14:10] <Cork> or rather you can insert text only
[08:14:19] <Cork> but you can't position it relative to a text node
[08:14:27] <Cork> only dom elements
[08:14:43] <Deusdeorum> hm, okey!

[09:50:45] <sponge-tmp> hello, is it not possible to load e.g. a picture via $.ajax("www.link-to.pic", ...) ? my browser gives an error with CORS (access control allow origin)..?
[09:52:27] <taplar> is there a reason you want to load it with ajax, vs a normal img tag?
[09:53:31] <sponge-tmp> taplar: actually i wanted to do something else. is it possible to retrieve the html file? (like the curl command?)
[09:54:17] <taplar> i thought you were after a picture.  sure you can load another page with ajax, provided it's not blocked by cors
[09:54:18] <sponge-tmp> and then scrape the <img> stuff out
[09:54:53] <taplar> if your getting cors, then your trying to request a resource on a different domain that does not allow that
[09:55:21] <sponge-tmp> taplar: ok so it depends on the domain im trying to fetch stuff from?
[09:55:27] <taplar> yep
[09:55:33] <sponge-tmp> taplar: ok thx :)
[09:55:50] <sponge-tmp> makes sense. i thought its not possible in general
[09:56:11] <taplar> the target server can configure itself to allow external requests at their discression
[09:58:11] <ul71m0_> I have a drupal module that has its own javascript and i cant change any of those, i have a button that on click, by default, expands one section, but i want to disable that expand and i just want to add class to it
[09:58:42] <ul71m0_> is there a way that i can somehow disable those other javascript action?
[09:59:02] <taplar> do you know how the on click is bound?  is it inline bound?
[09:59:20] <ul71m0_> let me check that
[10:00:04] <taplar> if it is inline you could just remove that attribute from the element
[10:03:44] <tona> hello , i am using bootstrap to show one dialog box , but it is showed on th top of my screen , is there one way to set it in the center of my html page ??? :)

[10:04:35] <ul71m0_> tona: check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18422223/bootstrap-3-modal-vertical-position-center
[10:05:21] <tona> thanks :)
[10:12:05] <taplar> ul71m0_: ah so the click is being bound logically, cool
[10:12:47] <ul71m0_> taplar: im trying to break the logic by just taking out the class or something like that
[10:15:41] <taplar> easiest way might be to put an overriding class on it, if you don't want the show to work
[10:16:47] <ul71m0_> taplar: the file is 900 lines long i just wanted to show you relevant part ;)
[11:18:28] <jcrawford> hello everyone quick question.  I think i know the issue just not sure how to solve it.  I have an active css state on menu items and a hover state.  On click it should keep the clicked item active and remove the class from all other elements hello everyone quick question

[11:18:53] <ertl> Hello, I'm using a $(window).on('unload', function() to release a lock when a page is closed. The code works fine on FF and Chrome, but nothing happens with Internet Explorer ... unload is not supported by IE? Thanks
[11:23:59] <taplar> jcrawford: your removing the class on blur, regardless of click or not
[11:29:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wh16aoj8/1/ possible solution
[11:39:25] <jcrawford> taplar thanks i will take a look now, sorry was called away from the desk :)
[11:39:57] <jcrawford> taplar yea that works, had it like that before but how can i also get the hover state?
[11:40:13] <Uhkis> where's bobby
[11:40:26] <taplar> what do you mean?
[11:40:55] <Uhkis> i think he or Cork are the only ones to solve my problem
[11:41:02] <taplar> it has a hover rule for the background in that last fiddle
[11:41:16] <taplar> ^ jcrawford
[11:41:17] <Uhkis> taplar: check this out http://uhkis.net/drop/css/
[11:41:37] <taplar> that's cool
[11:41:39] <Uhkis> line 99
[11:41:39] <jcrawford> taplar hmm in jsfiddle it wasn't doing anything for me on hover let me check again
[11:42:06] <jcrawford> yea that hover rule doesn't seem to work
[11:42:12] <decx> use transform instead of top/left
[11:42:47] <taplar> works for me, :/  the background changes on hover
[11:42:48] <jcrawford> ah ok works locally but not on the fiddle for some reason
[11:43:36] <Uhkis> decx: would that solve the waiting problem? O_o
[11:44:08] <Uhkis> this is like actionscript all over again, random console.log fixes stuff :D
[11:44:10] <jcrawford> eh... no it doesn't work locally i still had the jquery hover in place
[11:44:19] <jcrawford> when i removed that the css hover is not working properly locally for me
[11:44:30] <decx> well, to be fair. doing something like this with markup is ludicrous
[11:45:08] <taplar> jcrawford: but you get the concept right?  use the 'active' class to mark which one is active and force the styling to change with it, and also have different styling on :focus of the elements
[11:45:11] <decx> using css that doesnt even run on gpu only is only adding to that
[11:45:26] <jcrawford> yea taplar thanks i will try to get this all worked in :)
[11:45:52] <ertl> Hello, I'm using a $(window).on('unload', function() to release a lock when a page is closed. The code works fine on FF and Chrome, but nothing happens with Internet Explorer...
[11:47:15] <Uhkis> decx: element styles dont get the gpu acceleration? O_o
[11:47:46] <decx> that's right
[11:48:09] <decx> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/
[11:48:18] <Uhkis> decx: good to know, started this experiment with pure jquery: http://uhkis.net/drop/
[11:48:25] <Uhkis> and man is that laggy :D
[11:48:40] <decx> hehe
[11:48:52] <decx> i wrote a markup game as a test a few years ago
[11:48:58] <decx> even with transform it was shit
[11:49:15] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/Sg77m/
[11:49:52] <decx> arrows, space for controls or change the first var for mousecontrol
[11:50:05] <jcrawford> taplar not sure my html structure will allow for css to be used for hover state because i need to change the child icon and text colors as well on hover so best to just use jquery i think and add the class on hover to the proper element
[11:50:49] <Uhkis> decx: damn that looks a lot like my thesis work :D it was on android though
[11:51:46] <taplar> jcrawford: the issue your going to run into, which is what you were running into, is your removing that class on blur
[11:51:59] <taplar> your using one single class to drive your whole selected, hover, blur logic
[11:52:12] <jcrawford> yea gotta figure out a way around that happening
[11:52:35] <taplar> why not break up the css rules regarding coloring and icons so you can do the hover rules?
[12:26:55] <NaN> hi there
[12:27:36] <NaN> does $.ajax converts data param to json.stringify by default? (type set to json)
[12:27:54] <ckb> Hey fellas, quick question for you. Has anyone ever run into any problems with the iOS keyboard shifting content up 66px?
[12:28:06] <taplar> it will try to convert it for you
[12:28:25] <NaN> taplar: nice guy jquery hehe
[12:28:25] <taplar> but not to a json string, but to a param string
[12:28:38] <shoky> NaN: if you mean the request data, then no
[12:28:40] <NaN> so it's safe to only do data: object
[12:29:03] <shoky> if you mean the response data, then yes if it has json content-type header
[12:29:32] <shoky> if you do data: object  then jquery tries to send it as form data
[12:29:33] <NaN> shoky: it will... taplar and api docs says (Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests)
[12:29:50] <taplar> there's a difference between a json string and a parm string
[12:29:56] <shoky> NaN: right it will try to convert the object to a query string,  that's not json
[12:30:01] <taplar> shoky is addressing the json string
[12:30:09] <NaN> mmm
[12:30:47] <shoky> if you want the whole request body to be json you can do    contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify(object)
[12:31:12] <NaN> Oh I got it...
[12:31:23] <NaN> so it depends on the api end point
[12:31:30] <shoky> yea
[12:31:30] <taplar> always true, :)
[12:33:09] <jcrawford> taplar for what it is worth i had to add a clicked class to make the hover and click work together: http://pastie.org/10937862
[12:33:44] <taplar> sweet
[13:04:25] <JZA> hi I want to display a calendar, I dont want it to be a on change event but show the calendar on full screen, what do I need to do for that to happen?
[13:04:51] <JZA> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[13:05:21] <decx> check the display inline example
[13:05:25] <JZA> so instead of having an input text field, the user will just see the calendar widget with liquid design so it can go full screen.
[13:05:40] <JZA> ah great, just what I needed
[13:47:21] <jilocasin0> afternoon all...
[13:48:04] <JZA> how can I make the datepicker full screen or at least a proportional size to the screen?
[13:48:24] <jilocasin0> working with DataTables and I can't seem to find the docs on how to set up the datatable with hidden columns.  Can anyone point me in the general direction?
[13:54:48] <taplar> http://legacy.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/basic_init/hidden_columns.html ?
[13:57:04] <jilocasin0> taplar: thanks, but I', looking for the html table option tags. (ex <table data-display-rows="10", data-order='[[2,"ac"]] >, or <th data-sorting='disabled'> )'
[14:00:24] <jilocasin0> taplar: a listing of the custom html5 data-* atributes
[14:00:38] <taplar> huh?
[14:00:54] <taplar> html5 is a buzzword fwiw
[14:00:58] <taplar> what do you mean?
[14:01:29] <JZA> how can I make the jquery ui datepicker full screen and fluid?
[14:01:38] <JZA> so I can see it on a tablet.
[14:01:44] <jilocasin0> taplar: If it's a _buzzword_ then it's one the jQuery folks have embraced ( https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/html5-data-attributes.html )
[14:02:13] <taplar> i don't see jquery in that domain name, :)
[14:02:20] <jilocasin0> taplar: you can configure a jQuery datatable with various data-* options in the htlp tags.
[14:02:26] <hExDJ> there are no data-* attributes prior to html5, hence the use of the specific name
[14:03:18] <jilocasin0> hExDj: Thanks.
[14:03:20] <taplar> ah, coolio.  it's still a buzzword, :P
[14:03:31] <taplar> its a living standard.  no number
[14:04:19] <jilocasin0> taplar: It's more of a BC/AD sort of thing.... :D
[14:04:48] <taplar> i can see that
[14:06:10] <hExDJ> I think 'buzzword' is a buzzword
[14:06:24] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:06:39] <hExDJ> how do you like that inception?
[14:06:41] <hExDJ> :-D
[14:07:05] <taplar> never see a marketing presentation use it really
[14:07:33] <taplar> unless it's like, 'these are buzzwords.  we are the real deal!'
[14:08:06] <Uhkis> taplar: i'd say data- attributes (and canvas etc video) are the only place where html5 isn't a buzzword
[14:09:05] * taplar admits defeat within the context
[14:09:56] <jilocasin0> so, it looks like I'm looking up the wrong tree...
[14:11:56] <taplar> idk, we use datatables in shop but in no way would i say i'm fluent with it
[14:11:59] <Uhkis> i still do agree html5 is way too broadly used buzzword for basically anything js
[14:11:59] <jilocasin0> while there's a jQuery API, it's actually a BootStrap3 datatable.
[14:17:23] <taplar> fullscreen datepicker, eh?
[14:19:02] <taplar> JZA: so i guess the issue is it's flowing offscreen due to being placed around the input box?
[14:20:45] <JZA> yeah, i am designing a UI for a tablet/touch environment, and the first step is to select the date.
[14:21:17] <JZA> so the first screen the user would see is a calendar view to select the day, and then on click, it will slide to the next section of the page.
[14:22:45] <taplar> well the googs is turning up no results, guess it's time to tinker
[14:22:57] <Uhkis> "the googs" :D
[14:23:05] <taplar> :D
[14:24:08] <JZA> yeah I wouldnt think it would be that hard but is kind of hard to find, most people are more interested to see where on the screen will the datepicker will show
[14:24:11] <JZA> at least thats what stackoverflow did, plus I tried doing a simple width/height 100%
[14:24:13] <Uhkis> i think input type=date brings up the native date selector, that should be the one you want JZA
[14:24:22] <JZA> but it was able to get width but not height
[14:26:05] <JZA> Uhkis: actually I dont want a input, I can just display it inline on a div
[14:26:17] <Uhkis> oh
[14:26:29] <JZA> like this: https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[14:26:55] <JZA> I just need it to be full screen, I am trying to get the returned date on a JSON object.
[14:28:10] <JZA> like { date="...", selection2="....", selection3="..", name="Joe", email="foo@foo.com", } and ajax.post() to the api.
[14:28:15] <JZA> make sense?
[14:28:41] <JZA> so it doesnt need an HTML form output as long as I get the data on a json constructor.
[14:28:55] <JZA> but I need the UI to be responsive, like on a tablet full screen view.
[14:29:13] <decx> set .ui-datepicker width to auto
[14:29:17] <JZA> I've seen some bootstrap extra css for the jquery datepicker, but even that doesnt help with fullscreen.
[14:29:32] <JZA> yeah I tried width 100%; and height 100% but the height seems to be ignored
[14:29:47] <JZA> http://jsfiddle.net/tzw63xtm/
[14:30:11] <JZA> oops
[14:30:14] <JZA> wrong fiddle
[14:31:12] <JZA> http://jsfiddle.net/tzw63xtm/83/
[14:32:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vum5816p/ or something...
[14:32:25] <JZA> I got width: 100% and height: auto; on .ui-datepicker {} but nada.
[14:32:58] <JZA> cool
[14:33:01] <taplar> don't need that beforeShow
[14:33:06] <taplar> was trying stuff
[14:43:07] <decx> just do width auto
[14:43:39] <decx> making the whole thing full screen seems like a huge bother
[14:45:41] <JZA> well not 100% full screen.
[14:46:39] <JZA> soo.. .ui-datepicker-calendar > a { height: 100%; } didn't work
[14:47:00] <JZA> seems is just a <a> running that background, so 100% height dont apply

[15:44:17] <sponge-tmp> hello. is it possible to load jquery.js to any website in order to use jquery and edit that page?
[15:44:59] <sponge-tmp> in other words: I want to use jquery on a website (not mine). Can I load jquery.js via javascript ?
[15:46:52] <taplar> you could do something like that with plugins like greasemonkey
[15:47:04] <taplar> s/plugins/addons
[15:47:04] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> you could do something like that with addons like greasemonkey
[15:47:34] <sponge-tmp> taplar: i have greasemonkey installed. I was wondering though
[15:48:04] <taplar> yep.  the docs say there is a way to make it retrieve the resource and include it.  i've never had luck with that.  the scripts I do like that i just put the source in the userscript
[15:48:06] <sponge-tmp> like create a <script> item, then set src to the link
[15:48:46] <sponge-tmp> taplar: so youre telling me i can include the jquery.js file in my browser localy?
[15:49:10] <taplar> sure, in the greasemonkey script.  nothing to stop you from putting the jquery source directly in there
[15:49:38] <sponge-tmp> gonna try that! would be awesome :)
[15:49:41] <sponge-tmp> thx
[15:49:46] <taplar> sure
[15:50:28] <sponge-tmp> taplar: do you know where the scripts are stored localy?
[15:50:40] <taplar> uh, one sec
[15:50:47] <martixy> so uh, when I use jQ's ajax and there's a request pending on the page, I can't navigate away from the page till the request returns. Is there a way to do it?
[15:51:48] <taplar> sponge-tmp: if you go to a page that has an active greasemonkey script on it, then if you right click on the grease monkey script to edit it, the window that opens it should have the file location in the top menu
[15:52:16] <taplar> for me it's like c:\users\<userid>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\.....\gm_script....
[15:53:05] <taplar> martixy: your wanting to prevent the users from navigating away until the request finishes?
[15:53:17] <martixy> Exactly the opposite.
[15:53:18] <sponge-tmp> taplar: true! works. (but im using linux :) ).
[15:53:50] <taplar> sponge-tmp: cool
[15:54:13] <taplar> martixy: oh, you can't navigate because of the ajax and you want to
[15:54:27] <martixy> Because of the pending ajax, correct.
[15:54:33] <taplar> are you doing async: false?
[15:54:41] <martixy> No
[15:54:43] <taplar> hmm
[15:54:55] <taplar> by default ajax doesn't prevent navigation
[15:55:05] <taplar> something else is goingon
[15:55:47] <martixy> Except I've no idea what it might be.
[15:56:20] <martixy> Oh, wait, I think I might.
[16:05:20] <sponge-tmp> taplar: hi again. how can I now load the .js file from the grease monkey script? they are in the same dir :)
[16:05:43] <taplar> did you save the jquery source to a file in that directory?
[16:05:55] <sponge-tmp> yes
[16:06:12] <taplar> no, that's not what i was meaning.  i meant actually putting the source in your greasemonkey script
[16:06:34] <sponge-tmp> oh. but thats a hell lot of lines in there =D
[16:06:39] <taplar> it is, :)
[16:07:20] <taplar> only way i've done it before.  not saying there isn't another way
[16:07:51] <sponge-tmp> taplar: it looks stupid, but its working. if its working, its not stupid :D
[16:08:06] <umir-at-tawil> hey, so instead of rendering each element separately, this code seems to only render one at a time. advice? https://ghostbin.com/paste/k4gzw
[16:08:22] <sponge-tmp> the jquery.min.js is "only" 3 lines long, so its not spamming my editor vertically :) thx again taplar
[16:08:37] <taplar> sponge-tmp: sure, have fun, ^_^
[16:09:34] <taplar> umir-at-tawil: push all the things to an array and append the array at the end
[16:09:50] <taplar> well your in a then(), hmm
[16:11:54] <taplar> maybe still do that, but you'd have to keep an array of all those ajax deferreds, and do a $.when on them and only append when they're all done
[16:12:28] <taplar> though your not appending to the same place... lol
[16:12:32] <taplar> so... :s
[16:13:51] <taplar> maybe i misread it.  are you thinking that it is waiting until they are all done to do the dom update?
[16:14:38] <umir-at-tawil> taplar, i'm not sure what i'm thinking
[16:14:48] <umir-at-tawil> i just have a bunch of divs that i need to make gets for
[16:14:52] <umir-at-tawil> and update their html
[16:14:56] <umir-at-tawil> with the response
[16:17:05] <taplar> from your snipplet it should be doing that.  it just may be that they are returning fairly quickly, since it is a static resource your getting, and the dom may not get a chance to update until they are all done
[16:17:49] <umir-at-tawil> well what happens visually is, the elements render quickly, but one at a time very fast and then disappear, like the memory is disappearing
[16:17:59] <umir-at-tawil> and the only one displaying at the end is the very last one
[16:18:01] <shoky> it's a scope+timing issue,  by the time the callback is called, i already has the last value
[16:18:09] <shoky> typical js issue
[16:18:10] <taplar> ohhhhh
[16:18:16] <taplar> ^
[16:18:22] <taplar> yeah, just saw that, lol
[16:19:11] <taplar> could he use bind() for this?
[16:19:50] <shoky> umir-at-tawil use an array and .forEach  e.g.   Array(100).fill().forEach(function(val, i) { ... })
[16:20:09] <shoky> bind() is for setting `this` and arguments
[16:20:20] <taplar> right, i was thinking he could make it pass in the i
[16:20:28] <taplar> but maybe that would still be changing
[16:20:41] <shoky> ya you could do something like that
[16:21:19] <umir-at-tawil> alright let's try it!
[16:21:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wvj2bwnf/
[16:21:38] <shoky> if you want to keep the for loop you can still force it to have its own scope  e.g.  for (var i...) {  (function(i) { ... })(i) }
[16:21:44] <shoky> but taht's pretty gross
[16:21:59] <shoky> and .forEach already gives you a scope
[16:22:47] <umir-at-tawil> hey it worked!
[16:22:52] <umir-at-tawil> thanks shoky, taplar!
[16:22:54] <taplar> which way?
[16:23:10] <umir-at-tawil> Array(10)fill().forEach
[16:23:15] <taplar> cool
[16:28:52] <p1k> hello
[16:29:14] <p1k> I have npm installed jquery but it doesn't seem to export or anything (or work with es6 imports)
[16:31:18] <shoky> how are you trying to use it?  donno about es6 imports, but it works fine for me with npm and browserify
[17:11:46] <JZA> I have a date picker and want to send the date to a variable or rather push it on an array.
[17:11:50] <JZA> http://dpaste.com/038VKMK
[17:11:58] <JZA> wonder if this is correct
[17:15:32] <JZA> or maybe I am going this the wrong way and I should load the whole datepicker method on a variable.
[17:15:57] <JZA> like var mydate = $('selector').datepicker("getDate");
[17:38:59] <ertl> Hello, I'm using a $(window).on('unload', function() to release a lock when a page is closed. The code works fine on FF and Chrome, but nothing happens with Internet Explorer...
[17:48:30] <JZA> I am using jquery datepicker and have it displayed by default, and now I want to get the date and put it on some js object
[17:55:43] <JZA> anyone around
[18:00:30] <JZA> how can I invoke the date of the datepicker into an alert message?

[18:21:25] <JZA> taplar thanks
[19:04:43] <JZA> hi I wan tto create a hash table array object.
[19:06:08] <JZA> I thought this would be enough: https://jsfiddle.net/vum5816p/8/
[19:06:24] <JZA> but I am getting a syntax error unrecognized expression fecha: "08/24/2016"
[19:06:36] <JZA> guess I am missuing the .appendTo() method
[19:07:24] <shoky> JZA: appendTo and most other jquery methods are for manipulating stuff in the DOM, not arrays or objects
[19:07:42] <shoky> use regular js for js stuff.
[19:07:45] <JZA> ok
[19:08:17] <shoky> you make an array  with []
[19:08:22] <shoky> JZA: https://jsfiddle.net/vum5816p/9/
[19:08:35] <shoky> you should learn some basic javascript ;p
[19:54:05] <Buoy172> Howdy
[19:54:11] <Buoy172> I have a question
[19:55:11] <Buoy172> what the hell is this: $('#id').on('scroll', handler).data(uid, handler); ???
[19:55:24] <Buoy172> handler is a function, uid is a random number
[19:56:00] <Buoy172> this looks like the on() method returns something and then data() is called on it. What does on() return?
[20:07:45] <neilpdx> i'm sorry that i don't know the answer, but, i think that the on event has methods
[20:08:12] <neilpdx> i don't think that the data function is a method of the returned object
[20:23:52] <shoky> Buoy172: like many jquery methods, .on returns the original jquery object it was called on, so you can chain on more method calls
[20:24:16] <neilpdx> ah there you go :)
[20:24:48] <neilpdx> it better have a data method then
[21:46:19] <kof>  Hi!  i am using this to move a div to top jQuery('.' + $post_id ).each(function() { jQuery(this).parent().prepend(this); });
