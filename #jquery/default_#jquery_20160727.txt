[01:13:45] <Schilling> Good Evening all. Anyone a DataTables guru? I can't seem to get columns.classNames to render the styles according to the docs. Is there another setting I should be looking at?
[01:15:03] <Schilling> I've attempted both examples here: https://datatables.net/reference/option/columns.className
[03:23:22] <BW^-> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[03:23:22] <BW^-> <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="bootstrap-3.3.6/docs/assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[03:23:34] <BW^-> is this a recommended way to load jquery, why?
[03:33:06] <sillyslux> it's not
[03:33:16] <sillyslux> you can define fallbacks like this
[03:33:56] <sillyslux> "should googleapis.com be inaccessable take it from somewhere else"
[03:34:55] <sillyslux> you might as well define 5 cdn more fallbacks for all your scripts and other resources (css an whatever)
[03:35:04] <sillyslux> but there's really not point in doing so
[04:07:07] <djam90> Hi, when I have an ajax with done and fail, is it possible to bind "this" into the callbacks? For example: $.getJSON(url).done(function(){}).fail(function(){});  Because they are chained, how can I use ".bind(this)" on each one?
[04:16:08] <BW^-> sillyslux: ah so that's the point, ok perfect :)
[04:16:09] <BW^-> right
[04:16:11] <BW^-> sillyslux: thanks!
[04:41:14] <mikatone> Hi is there a way I can unbind the click handler while ajax call is being made? https://gist.github.com/fccpt/065945df0503ff33a5c86198ebff0941
[05:02:55] <codecutter> Seems to trigger more then once upon a singke scroll http://pastebin.com/205Bp9ye
[05:17:29] <mikatone> is there any way I can remove event handler of element while ajax call gets done ?
[05:30:27] <codecutter> adding breakpoint to a line seems to cause the multiple trigger go away http://pastebin.com/205Bp9ye
[05:52:01] <codecutter> seems to behave as it should when i remove line 5 i.e. output 'true' only once but if i uncomment line 5 then i get multiple out of 'true' (function triggers twice)

[07:19:33] <jigolo> hi
[08:16:19] <urbanendeavour> After I use this code, nothing is executed, how can I debug this?
[08:16:26] <urbanendeavour> $.getJSON("data/datafile.json", function(result){
[08:16:44] <urbanendeavour> I tried console.log and alert() and nothing fires. .But cannot see why it is failing.
[08:20:43] <codecutter> Cork: around?

[08:23:59] <anupsuri> Hi guys
[08:24:17] <anupsuri> I need a help please
[08:24:44] <anupsuri> how can I remove the value if i am triggering again same button
[08:24:46] <anupsuri> https://jsfiddle.net/1ezcj5k0/
[08:25:09] <anupsuri> actually I am adding the value in comma saprated in a hidden input box
[08:26:38] <anupsuri> but if I would click on cross button then needs to remove that value from input box
[08:26:39] <anupsuri> https://jsfiddle.net/69es4n30/1/
[08:26:44] <anupsuri> please help me
[08:40:55] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/Fd9CZ5aj
[08:56:40] <codecutter> back
[09:03:51] <jerit> codecutter you got help with this? http://pastebin.com/Fd9CZ5aj
[09:04:07] <codecutter> nope
[09:04:29] <jerit> mkay well, how much are you scrolling? Remember, every time the window scrolls, that scroll event handler is going to fire
[09:04:39] <taplar> many times
[09:05:53] <jerit> So you can do the custom event on a scroll like you have, but set up so that the custom event only fires when a particular condition is met
[09:06:11] <taplar> debounce/throttle it
[09:06:39] <codecutter> well if i remove line 5 then it seems to be okay, which leads me to think it has something to do with that custom event on line 5
[09:10:27] <jerit> Could well be but we can't really say without seeing what that custom event does or if we don't see it in action
[09:11:50] <codecutter> it may have something to do with the way twitter flight framework works, are you familiar with?
[09:11:53] <codecutter> it*
[09:12:00] <urbanendeavour> I am trying to display json values in an option element and just keep getting [object, object] as the values
[09:12:13] <taplar> urbanendeavour: show us what your doing?
[09:15:03] <urbanendeavour> https://jsfiddle.net/ucgmt8u6/
[09:15:59] <taplar> iirc, $.each does not break objects down by key and value
[09:16:11] <taplar> it passes in each object and an index
[09:17:02] <taplar> i'm assuming the console log is printing out the object object thing?
[09:17:07] <urbanendeavour> yes
[09:17:32] <taplar> yep, so instead take a look at Object.prototype.keys()
[09:17:38] <taplar> you can forEach off of that
[09:20:51] <shoky> Object.keys()  ;p
[09:20:55] <taplar> or change your response to be an array, :)
[09:21:03] <taplar> well i put prototype cause i usually use that when googling
[09:21:22] <urbanendeavour> what is prototype?
[09:21:42] <shoky> a javascript thing, but not relevant here
[09:22:19] <shoky> but $.each does work on objects iirc
[09:22:57] <shoky> show us your data, urbanendeavour
[09:23:03] <taplar> huh
[09:23:13] <shoky> if you're getting objects, then maybe the data is objects
[09:24:37] <urbanendeavour> https://jsfiddle.net/ucgmt8u6/1/
[09:24:42] <arup_r> Hi, I need a help. What I want is, when my mouse is outside of the image, I want the text box to be disappeared like 'display: none'. Any help to achieve that? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jAKGPb
[09:25:28] <shoky> urbanendeavour: your data is an object, with a "Schools" property. and that property is an array, not an object
[09:26:16] <arup_r> So I am confused between https://api.jquery.com/mouseout/ and https://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/ .. which one to use?
[09:26:33] <taplar> arup_r: you could forgo js and just use css for this
[09:26:40] <shoky> urbanendeavour: maybe you want the first $.each to be:  $.each(data.Schools, ...
[09:27:10] <urbanendeavour> should I use an array or an object?
[09:27:12] <arup_r> taplar: I need to move the imput text relative to current mouse position on the image
[09:27:38] <arup_r> I didn't know that can be done only by CSS. Can you show me how?
[09:27:47] <taplar> not that part, but the show hide part, yeah
[09:27:54] <taplar> you want to float an input field around with the mouse?
[09:28:01] <arup_r> yes
[09:28:14] <taplar> how would they ever be able to click it to actually put input in it?
[09:28:24] <arup_r> yes that is the next problem.. :)
[09:28:28] <taplar> -_-
[09:28:37] <arup_r> But i thought to ask first hide on mouse leave
[09:28:42] <taplar> one sec
[09:28:45] <arup_r> ok

[09:34:31] <taplar> i'm just showing you the concept
[09:35:05] <arup_r> hum got you
[09:35:18] <arup_r> that is what I am reading now in your fiddle
[09:36:49] <arup_r> good idea.. let me apply it on my css
[09:39:33] <taplar> urbanendeavour: are you going to return more information that just the club name eventually?
[09:41:08] <arup_r> taplar: now, any idea what to be done, to put some text inside the input field? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jAKGPb :) I fixed show/hide issue as per your guide line
[09:41:44] <taplar> i can't test it on the codepen.  for some reason the image does not show
[09:41:45] <urbanendeavour> taplar, yes and I would like to filter by fields also
[09:41:58] <urbanendeavour> so that content displayed has commonalities
[09:42:04] <urbanendeavour> Not sure how best to do this
[09:42:09] <taplar> urbanendeavour: cool.  i was just going to suggest if not, then passing back objects was a little overkill
[09:43:05] <arup_r> ok taking it to fiddle

[09:44:29] <w3gi> hi. i am working on a 3d spin and it works on a pc fine - just on a tablet it dont work
[09:44:43] <taplar> ok, so the only thing i can think of is when it's like that to apply the focus to the input box maybe
[09:45:02] <w3gi> i use the on mouse down to turn the spin
[09:45:08] <taplar> that's really weird ui though arup_r
[09:45:12] <w3gi> what could I use on a phone?
[09:46:08] <taplar> w3gi: uh maybe tapstart
[09:46:14] <taplar> google mobile events
[09:46:27] <taplar> "javascript, mobile touch events"
[09:46:53] <taplar> or touchstart, i forget
[09:48:07] <w3gi> i need mousedown and mousemove
[09:48:26] <taplar> what mouse is there on a tablet?
[09:48:34] <taplar> your using your finger  no?
[09:48:38] <w3gi> sry
[09:48:48] <w3gi> i mean i use on pc mousedown and mousemove
[09:49:01] <taplar> sure
[09:49:14] <w3gi> so on phone mousedown = tabstart and what is mousemove?
[09:49:22] <taplar> google man, :)
[10:05:00] <Yepp> I am using .on handler but when my data tables are reloaded... can't click on the buttons anymore
[10:05:08] <Yepp> am i missing something?
[10:05:14] <Yepp> what causes that? hmm
[10:06:11] <slax0r> are you delegating?
[10:06:23] <slax0r> are the buttons recreated in the dom?
[10:07:12] <slax0r> using normal .on does not delegate, and you will have to reattach handlers if an item is (re)created in dom after an event has already been attached
[10:07:18] <slax0r> event handler*
[10:07:42] <Yepp> hmm not sure how DataTables reloads the page but I listen on the table itself and then looks for ".btn" for example on the selector
[10:07:52] <Yepp> i mean, how it reloads the table*
[10:07:52] <slax0r> show some code
[10:08:08] <slax0r> the .on definition
[10:08:46] <slax0r> normally you'll want $("some parent of the element that you wish to attach to").on("click", "actual element", function() {})
[10:08:54] <Yepp> http://www.hastebin.com/akuvodibey.coffee
[10:09:10] <Yepp> even tried listening on the document itself
[10:10:12] <slax0r> don't bind delegated events to the document object
[10:10:21] <slax0r> bind it to the table element
[10:10:29] <slax0r> the table is the parent of all those buttons right?
[10:10:48] <Yepp> like what's written on the comment part, it was originally binded on the table
[10:11:10] <slax0r> it was .table instead of document?
[10:11:20] <Yepp> yep
[10:11:58] <slax0r> hum, never had this happen before
[10:12:42] <Yepp> hmm, so here's what happened just now
[10:12:48] <Yepp> i have two buttons on the action column
[10:12:52] <Yepp> edit and delete
[10:13:07] <Yepp> after deleting a row, it would reload the table
[10:13:33] <Yepp> delete buttonS would not work from here. but edit buttons would still work
[10:14:07] <slax0r> don't think that you have event handling issues
[10:15:09] <Yepp> what is it then? all delete/edit buttons works when it is still not reloaded, but once they are reloaded, the previous button used to reload that table would now not work
[10:15:52] <taplar> your saying one of those delegate bindings stops working after the reload?
[10:16:29] <slax0r> Yepp: you can test that quite easily, just drop a console.log or similar into each of the handlers, and check console if you are getting outputs
[10:16:51] <Yepp> yes. hmm, surprisingly edit button still works even after reload. Just tried it to make it sure it wouldn't work but it does.
[10:17:35] <taplar> that would seem to suggest that your reload is not putting the expected class(es) on the elements to satisfy one of the delegates
[10:17:36] <Yepp> i'll do the console.log
[10:19:14] <Yepp> false alarm, the console.log is being triggered. Hmm, i guess it's not an even handler problem. I'll look more in my codes
[10:24:19] <Yepp> i think i found the culprit: http://www.hastebin.com/wukuxiweho.django the .popover();
[10:24:56] <Yepp> seems like when the table is reloaded, the popover is being deleted
[10:28:51] <urbanendeavour> Why is function() passed into this function? I thought it only took a url and an optional data argument?
[10:28:51] <urbanendeavour> $.getJSON("data/data.json", function(data){
[10:28:59] <urbanendeavour> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[10:32:59] <shoky> urbanendeavour: as you can see there's also an optional success callback argument
[10:34:24] <z1haze_work> how do you use the :not selector on a delegated listener? is that possible?
[10:34:38] <shoky> it's possible, sure
[10:34:43] <shoky> you just use it ;p
[10:35:00] <z1haze_work> its a bit confusing for me though - woudl this be right? on('click', '.product-detail:not(#product-set-list) .swatchanchor'
[10:35:31] <shoky> if that's the right selector for the elements you want to listen for, then yes it's right :)
[10:36:56] <w3gi> touchstart dont work...
[10:37:26] <w3gi> what is the equivalent to mousedown on a phone
[10:41:23] <urbanendeavour> shoky, ok, but what does it mean when I'm sending function() to it as the success callback?
[10:41:48] <urbanendeavour> I thought this function its retrieving the data ,then i am using function() to do stuff with it not passing it as an argument,
[10:42:59] <shoky> urbanendeavour: the callback function is where you can access the json data. you can't get it outside the callback
[10:44:01] <shoky> urbanendeavour: because ajax is asynchronous, the response only comes back later - and is passed to your callback
[10:44:54] <urbanendeavour> ok thanks

[10:48:38] <Serg_Penguin> hi ! how to sort DOM nodes by arbitrary criteria, like .data('some-number-from-sql') or function ?
[10:49:06] <urbanendeavour> is there an option in chrome to display DOM mutations?
[10:49:41] <NoiseEee> Serg_Penguin: how does one 'sort' DOM nodes anyways?
[10:53:57] <relipse> does anyone know why my carousel is not showing up? http://staging.handofhelp.com/resources if you inspect, it will show each <sectionn> highlighted but nothing shows up on the page
[10:54:13] <Serg_Penguin> NoiseEee, I just want well designed interfaces like in Java, but we have no, something like ISortAlgorithm(ICollectionAdapter), but we have no :(
[10:55:41] <taplar> wha?
[10:57:40] <NoiseEee> Serg_Penguin: you'll have to write a sorting algorithm yourself, and no javascript is not at all like java.   that being said if you are just sorting list elements for example by a data- attribute, its relatively easy to do
[10:58:04] <jerit> relipse its really hard to diagnose when I don't know what's supposed to be showing up and where
[10:58:37] <relipse> jerit: this slider is supposed to be showing up: http://flasherland.com/themeforest/storylineslider/
[10:58:53] <relipse> and if you hiighlight <section> tags you'll see how it is supposed to be showing
[11:00:47] <jerit> relipse when I took position:relative; off of .carousel something appeared
[11:01:11] <jerit> think that might be what you're looking for
[11:01:26] <relipse> ok one sec thanks
[11:05:04] <w3gi> how i can prevent a page from dragging arround or scrolling arround?
[11:06:31] <w3gi> in case var != null
[11:08:18] <urbanendeavour> To add datalist options to a HTML page how should I load them in? I can see the elements in the dev tools elements screen but they do not appear in the document.
[11:08:48] <relipse> jerit: thanks that was a great help
[11:09:05] <taplar> urbanendeavour: add the options with js or html?
[11:09:14] <jerit> relipse got you sorted? Excellent :)
[11:13:24] <relipse> jerit: ok i'm also wondering about the left and right arrows which are supposed to appear, they are invisible: see ss-nav-arrows-next
[11:18:48] <jerit> relipse definitely a css issue but I can't seem to find it. Maybe ask in #css
[11:35:26] <jerit> riddle me this: ajax post to api intermittently fails but the very next execution of the code posts fine. What cause could there be for the failure?
[11:38:32] <NoiseEee> what does the API provide as its 'fail' response?
[11:38:39] <NoiseEee> any message?  what server response?
[11:43:44] <urbanendeavour> taplar, I added them with JS
[11:44:08] <urbanendeavour> I can see the html it is correct, but the options are not displaying in the list dropdown. I used document.load
[12:10:47] <relipse> ok on this page, http://staging.handofhelp.com/resources/ I have 2 carousels of different types, is there any way to get them displayed properly?
[12:11:06] <relipse> the top carousel should be on the bottom but it looks like it is floating
[12:23:57] <urbanendeavour> I can see the datalist options in the HTML but they are not available in the dropbox menu, why is that?
[12:23:58] <urbanendeavour> https://jsfiddle.net/ucgmt8u6/4/
[12:30:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ucgmt8u6/5/ hmm?
[12:31:51] <arc_> i've never heard of a datalist
[12:32:13] <arc_> this is a text box with a dropdown?
[12:32:26] <taplar> kinda like an auto complete it seems
[12:32:59] <arc_> i'm kinda confused why line 34 and 35 are identical
[12:33:05] <arc_> it results in each option being added twice
[12:33:17] <taplar> *shrug* i just made it function, :)
[12:33:27] <arc_> i wasn't saying it was your fault ;)
[12:34:15] <arc_> i actually like this form type. it feels better than a normal dropdown as far as trying to fill it with the keyboard
[12:34:29] <arc_> but i guess it opens you up to people inputting random bs
[12:34:38] <taplar> i'll have to check out how it renders on a mobile later
[12:34:54] <taplar> i've seen it before, i just keep forgetting it exists
[12:40:17] <jerit> in an ajax post, you can actually have it without a success block can't you?
[12:40:43] <taplar> sure
[12:40:47] <jerit> ajax ({type, url, data, error});
[12:41:15] <taplar> $.ajax({ url: '', method: '' });
[12:41:24] <taplar> actually don't have to have method either
[12:41:35] <taplar> defaults to GET iirc
[12:56:46] <jerit> taplar I need it to POST though
[12:57:23] <jerit> also, we have an error where the data doesn't appear to be arriving in the API and my contractor had the error block looking like this:
[12:57:32] <jerit> error: { // alert("error"); }
[12:59:19] <taplar> it should be a function
[12:59:43] <neilpdx> hello from portland
[13:00:05] <taplar> error: function ( blah ) { console.log( blah ); }
[13:00:15] <jerit> ah was about to check
[13:08:31] <jerit> taplar since I know my API will return HTTP 400 if its unable to save the posted data, maybe I should work with the statusCode setting on the ajax
[13:08:49] <jerit> never done it before though so I think ima have to find an example
[13:09:03] <taplar> one sec
[13:09:48] <Themediator> I am trying to use a button to clone an input field, then apply the same autocomplete function to all the input fields. However, it is only applying the autocomplete function to the first input. I have them being named as "object1", "object2" etc and then selected as [name*=object]
[13:10:24] <taplar> jerit: statusCode takes an object with the key being the response code and the value being the callback
[13:11:11] <taplar> Themediator: if your not applying the autocomplete initialization on the cloned element, it most likely is not there
[13:12:08] <jerit> taplar can I use statusCode with success and error?
[13:12:23] <jerit> don't see any reason why I wouldn't be able to though so maybe a bit of a silly question
[13:12:35] <taplar> sure, though if you have statusCode and error, both will potentially execute
[13:14:06] <Themediator> taplar: I have my autocomplete function inside of the $(document).ready function. Do I need to put another autocomplete function inside the button press to add autocomplete to the newly cloned object?
[13:14:40] <jerit> Themediator: have you thought about using the jqueryui autocomplete? jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/default.html
[13:14:50] <taplar> you should be able to use the same function.  if you have it inline you'll probably want to extract it, name it, and use it in both places
[13:14:59] <Themediator> jerit: that's what I am using
[13:15:04] <jerit> oh
[13:19:13] <Themediator> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/kasn3eq8/ not sure what I am doing wrong here
[13:20:19] <taplar> don't find the element that you created.  store it in a var before you append it and just use it
[13:20:56] <Themediator> what do you mean?
[13:21:06] <taplar> ln 8
[13:21:19] <taplar> store the clone in a var and use that var on ln 11
[13:21:39] <Themediator> so like var x = $(object).clone()?
[13:21:42] <taplar> yep
[13:21:49] <Themediator> okay
[13:22:14] <taplar> you have a couple other lookups that you are repeating that you could do that with
[13:22:27] <taplar> generally speaking you want to limit the number of times you hit the dom
[13:23:17] <Themediator> So do I need to instate the autocomplete function before or after the insertBefore? Or does it matter?
[13:23:25] <taplar> shouldn't matter
[13:24:19] <Themediator> it still doesn't seem to be working
[13:28:41] <Themediator> nevermind, I figured it out. My selector wasn't working properly lol
[13:28:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kasn3eq8/2/
[13:29:49] <Themediator> taplar: thanks, that's much cleaner than what I have lol
[13:29:59] <taplar> ;)

[13:34:30] <Themediator> okay
[13:34:33] <taplar> $newIngredient.find('input').val('');
[13:36:26] <taplar> or you could store a clone so it's not connected to the user input

[13:58:35] <codecutter> It should trigger when the last 'li' comes into view http://pastebin.com/C7MmXRU5
[13:58:35] <codecutter> waypoint doc: http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/api/waypoint/
[13:58:58] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle insteaD?
[13:59:14] <codecutter> i'm using the selector on line 2 correctly?
[14:00:17] <robertmaxrees> ('.timeline-list > li')[0] will be the first one in your collection.
[14:00:29] <codecutter> last?
[14:00:32] <robertmaxrees> first.
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> [0] is the 0th index.
[14:00:54] <codecutter> i mean how do i get the last elem?
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> $('.timeline-list > li').last()[0]
[14:02:30] <robertmaxrees> also: it looks like they have a jquery interface for that plugin
[14:03:08] <codecutter> and?
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> why not use it?
[14:03:31] <Ziberius> hello
[14:03:37] <Ziberius> is the datatable plugin off topic?
[14:03:43] <Ziberius> or may I ask questions about that
[14:03:44] <codecutter> link?
[14:03:57] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius not necessarily, just don't assume that you'll get an answer :)
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> codecutter the cods page you linked.
[14:04:03] <robertmaxrees> *docs
[14:04:05] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: hehe fair enough
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius have you tried their forum?
[14:04:29] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: nope maybe I should just thought it would be faster here
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius feel free to toss it out here, just no guarantees.
[14:05:03] <codecutter> what do you mean 'jquery interface'?
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> codecutter $.fn.waypoint(options)
[14:06:30] <Ziberius> OK thanx well I'm running a function on "fnDrawCallback" that iterates throught the table columns. I have set the property "mData" on the "aoColumns" that I need to access on this iteration. I have the table and the index but I'm not sure how to achieve this.
[14:06:49] <Ziberius> any ideas would be appreciated
[14:07:00] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: i'm trying to get it to trigger when the page reaches bottom
[14:07:14] <codecutter> not sure how to do this.
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> codecutter any console errors?
[14:07:36] <codecutter> i don't not how to do it
[14:07:42] <codecutter> know*
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> open your developer tools :)
[14:08:14] <codecutter> first i need the code to test
[14:08:19] <codecutter> :)
[14:08:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> so you haven't even tried orrrr...?
[14:09:05] <codecutter> i mean, instead of an element, i'd like it to trigger when the scroll reaches the bottom
[14:10:06] <codecutter> No element option passed to Waypoint constructor
[14:10:12] <robertmaxrees> http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/api/offset-option/

[14:11:45] <robertmaxrees> has a few options for that kind of stuff.
[14:15:46] <codecutter> jquery interface doesnt seem to work http://pastebin.com/rKBtdLeG
[14:16:00] <robertmaxrees> you might need to load something else.
[14:16:06] <robertmaxrees> or load jquery before you load waypoints.

[14:16:09] <robertmaxrees> just a though.

[14:16:24] <codecutter> ah
[14:31:37] <acavalier> hi, I recently upgraded to jQuery 3.1 from an app (that uses Bootstrap) which was previously on 2.x
[14:32:03] <acavalier> mostly, it's all good. However, there's one page that breaks on IE10, inside jQuery code
[14:32:14] <z1haze_work> When I fadeout a div, how do i smooth the transition for the container below it to move into its place?
[14:32:47] <acavalier> the F12 developer tools says that 'a.querySelectorAll("*,:x")' is a syntax error
[14:32:58] <acavalier> is this a jQuery bug?
[14:33:03] <taplar> lol
[14:33:08] <taplar> how is that jQuery?
[14:33:14] <acavalier> uh, it's in jquery.js?
[14:33:26] <acavalier> perhaps I should grab the unminifed version
[14:33:38] <robertmaxrees> acavalier or it's that bootstrap relies on specific behavior for 2.x
[14:33:52] <acavalier> robertmaxrees: the callstack doesn't have bootstrap in it
[14:33:58] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:34:02] <robertmaxrees> right, but you're using bootstrap.
[14:34:04] <acavalier> there isn't any bootstrap used on this page that isn't used on a lot of other pages
[14:34:11] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:34:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change whether or not they support 3.x
[14:34:19] <acavalier> I know. But I'm on bs3.3.7, released yesterday
[14:34:24] <z1haze_work> when I fadeOut an element, is there a way to make the element below it slide into place vs the instant jerk?
[14:34:25] <acavalier> which supports 3.x officially
[14:34:30] <acavalier> 3.3.6 and before do not, yes
[14:34:40] <acavalier> er, sorry. released on the 25th.
[14:34:47] <robertmaxrees> acavalier alright.  sounds like there may be some other problem then :)
[14:34:58] * acavalier grabs the unminified version to get a better message
[14:35:07] <acavalier> I'll ping the devs, I suppose :)
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> have you tried reducing down the page to see what causes the problem?
[14:35:36] <taplar> querySelectorAll("*") :/
[14:36:14] <acavalier> robertmaxrees: not yet. I have a guess, but given that the string argument to querySelectorAll is hardcoded
[14:36:22] <acavalier> I doubt that would do anything but mitigate the bug
[14:36:43] <robertmaxrees> so what's your guess?
[14:36:52] <acavalier> a jQuery bug?
[14:37:07] <acavalier> looks like jQuery or possibly Sizzle is passing an invalid selector to querySelectorAll
[14:37:32] <robertmaxrees> right, so they wouldn't do that by default.  it soulds like something else is doing something funky.  i'd start tearing things out and seeing what triggers it.
[14:37:43] * acavalier sighs
[14:37:48] <acavalier> "by default"
[14:37:54] <z1haze_work> hmm
[14:37:56] <acavalier> this is not a selector I passed to jQuery
[14:38:16] <acavalier> if it was, yes, it might be my fault, but it isn't
[14:38:22] <acavalier> it's a selector that's hard-coded into jQuery
[14:38:30] <acavalier> and the website clearly says that IE9+ is supported
[14:38:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry, i'm poorly explaining myself.
[14:38:37] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[14:39:36] <taplar> huh, so it is
[14:40:05] <acavalier> oh, it looks like that's expected, the bug is elsewhere
[14:40:10] <acavalier> still a jQuery bug though.
[14:42:23] <robertmaxrees> you'll be asked for a reduced test case to prove that the bug is a result of jquery fwiw.
[14:42:29] <robertmaxrees> generally in the form of a jsfiddle.

[15:12:40] <robertmaxrees> the best part is that the only thing that changes is the timestamp hahaha
[15:12:44] <taplar> even more so at the suplicity of the page
[15:12:45] <robertmaxrees> we're so used to it though.
[15:12:54] <taplar> simplicity

[15:13:09] <robertmaxrees> this year is less bad than some past ones.
[15:13:37] <GeekMonkey> I am storing the hover image name in a data attribute but I want to preload the image... any thoughts on how to do that?
[15:14:05] <taplar> image name?

[15:14:57] <GeekMonkey> taplar
[15:15:35] <taplar> so the url
[15:15:38] <GeekMonkey> I want to preload the images in the data-hover attr
[15:16:17] <taplar> iirc, you can do a new Image(), and then set the src to the url and your browser will load it
[15:16:41] <taplar> think someone was doing something like that a few days ago
[15:17:26] <taplar> robertmaxrees: i really think who ever made that site should modify it.  it really should be like a counter that is "days since a fire"
[15:17:42] <robertmaxrees> 0
[15:17:45] <taplar> lol
[15:17:46] <robertmaxrees> it would always be 0 hahahahaha

[15:22:04] <GeekMonkey> taplar yes it is
[15:22:55] <robertmaxrees> relipse wut
[15:23:03] <robertmaxrees> are those 2 different carousels?
[15:24:25] <robertmaxrees> relipse it looks like featured-page doesn't properly set a height.
[15:27:56] <relipse> robertmaxrees yes 2 different ones
[15:29:24] <relipse> robertmaxrees so what do i do to fix it
[15:29:38] <robertmaxrees> relipse you need to fix the CSS for them.
[15:29:50] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have anything simple to offer to fix it.
[15:29:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to dig in more.
[15:47:07] <GeekMonkey> taplar I modified you script a hair and now it works like a charm
[15:47:14] <taplar> sweet
[16:13:54] <jerit> taplar: you here?
[16:14:06] <taplar> i deny all involvement
[16:14:12] <jerit> lolol
[16:14:37] <jerit> would appreciate if you could look over this for me :P all issues are included in the post http://pastebin.com/FCfYZFFq
[16:15:15] <robertmaxrees> for loops and timeouts.
[16:15:18] <robertmaxrees> feels bad man.
[16:16:12] <robertmaxrees> jerit are these DB tables or...?
[16:16:17] <taplar> ReceiptNumber looks to be a global var
[16:16:28] <jerit> robertmaxrees: just tables I'm building on the page
[16:16:37] <jerit> taplar: it is because its used in the CreateData() function
[16:16:39] <robertmaxrees> ^ taplar has a salient point.
[16:16:52] <robertmaxrees> is ReceiptNumber controlling which table gets updated?
[16:17:30] <jerit> robertmaxrees: no the tables that are being updated here aren't representative of database tables. They just indicate what happened with the posts
[16:17:48] <robertmaxrees> right, i saw that.  and your issue is that var is global.
[16:17:57] <taplar> yeah, it's scoped too high
[16:18:01] <robertmaxrees> so basically you're stomping all over it a bunch of times.  need to scope it down.
[16:18:57] <taplar> also what is PostCompleted used for?
[16:20:38] <jerit> taplar: I don't want statusCode and error blocks to both execute so that basically just limits it to "do 1 thing per post" in case those 2 decide they both need to execute
[16:21:05] <jerit> you're gonna laugh robertmaxrees or maybe bash your head on your desk...
[16:21:16] <jerit> here's the signature for CreateData() -> function CreateData(receiptNumber)
[16:21:22] <jerit> I wasn't passing in a value there
[16:21:37] <jerit> also the loop iterated 202 times when I specified 20 iterations
[16:23:32] <taplar> you can take the PostComplete logic out of the success callback
[16:23:55] <taplar> and I'd probably just check the response code in the error instead, really
[16:25:53] <jerit> oh you mean scrap the statusCode block?
[16:26:22] <jerit> why's it looping 10x more times than I'm telling it to though?
[16:26:37] <jerit> specify 20 iterations and it loops 202 times O_o
[16:26:48] <taplar> no, keep it, but instead of the extra variable and having to set it and check it, the error callback should be able to have a reference to the status code returned.  you could just check that it was not one that would have been handled in the statusCode
[16:28:18] <jerit> taplar: not very clear on how to do that
[16:29:05] <jerit> error: function (data, statusText, xhr) { //spit out xhr.status maybe? }
[16:29:25] <taplar> jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown
[16:29:36] <taplar> are the arguments to error
[16:37:34] <jerit> I don't understand what is going on here :/
[16:37:52] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[16:42:22] <jerit> robertmaxrees: here is updated code
[16:43:15] <jerit> if I specify 20 iterations, it says loop ended on iteration number 1
[16:43:48] <jerit> console doesn't log any receipt numbers either
[16:44:37] <jerit> it isn't actually posting the data either
[16:45:34] <robertmaxrees> where's the updated code?
[16:46:51] <jerit> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/YNe9yH5c
[16:47:24] <taplar> i == loops ?
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> you want i < loops.
[16:47:53] <robertmaxrees> and you're still going to have scoping issues.
[16:48:11] <jerit> taplar: I'm just trying stuff
[16:49:06] <jerit> robertmaxrees: that's the part that says "while this condition isn't true, keep looping until it is", right?
[16:49:29] <robertmaxrees> IS true
[16:49:31] <robertmaxrees> not isn't.
[16:51:00] <jerit> while the condition is true, so while i is less than or equal to loops
[16:51:14] <jerit> so if I wanted to get exactly 20 loops, the target value should be 21?
[16:51:24] <taplar> all depends on your conditional
[16:52:11] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/s10a5jzs/
[16:54:24] <jerit> taplar, other problem is that not all the functions to write to the tables are working
[16:55:16] <robertmaxrees> jerit because they're writing to the last one?
[16:55:43] <jerit> no, I think the jquery is looping too fast for the api to keep up and send its responses
[16:55:51] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> so what's the symptom you're seeing.
[16:56:08] <robertmaxrees> your problem is that you're working with async programming.
[16:56:51] <jerit> screenshot incoming robertmaxrees
[16:56:58] <robertmaxrees> screenshots aren't really helpful.
[16:58:46] <taplar> uh, ln 41 is outside of the loop btw
[17:01:49] <jerit> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/HoCJ9FW.png
[17:02:25] <jerit> [22:56] <taplar> uh, ln 41 is outside of the loop btw        <<< that's fine. That was just to see what the value of the counter was at the end of the loop
[17:02:43] <jerit> robertmaxrees: I added some notes to the screenshot

[17:22:21] <safinn> I'm using jquery in an electron app on windows and im using the hover function. The mouse leave does not fire when moving up but does when moving down. Works fine on mac. Any ideas why?
[17:56:28] <cangelosx> how can I select an element where name="fields[]"
[17:56:48] <robertmaxrees> an attribute selector.
[17:57:02] <cangelosx> $('[name=fields[]]')
[17:57:05] <cangelosx> syntax error
[17:57:13] <taplar> use "" around the value
[17:57:14] <robertmaxrees> need to escape the []
[17:57:33] <robertmaxrees> also yeah, need to quote th evalue.
[17:57:37] <robertmaxrees> *the value
[17:57:59] <cangelosx> oh, you can do that
[17:58:00] <cangelosx> TIL
[17:58:02] <cangelosx> thanks
[17:58:09] <taplar> you *should* always do that
[17:58:35] <cangelosx> its working with quotes without escaping. is that okay?
[17:58:46] <taplar> yep, that's what they are there for.
[17:58:46] <cangelosx> unless by escaping you mean using quotes
[17:58:57] <taplar> no, rob was talking about using \
[17:59:23] <taplar> but putting quotes around it tells it it's a literal string, effectively escaping it
[17:59:34] <cangelosx> so is [name="fields[]"] okay or do I really need to backslash the brackets
[17:59:41] <cangelosx> oh, okay
[18:00:07] <cangelosx> maybe he was referring to escaping the double quotes if you're using double quotes around it
[18:00:47] <cangelosx> i use single
[18:00:54] <cangelosx> on the outside, i mean
[18:01:17] <robertmaxrees> you use double on the inside.
[18:01:20] <robertmaxrees> if singles out.
[18:01:22] <cangelosx> yes
[18:01:49] <cangelosx> i was just asking if you were talking about escaping the brackets themselves or the quotes
[18:02:04] <taplar> originally there were no quotes so....
[18:04:10] <graphettion_> "Is that a poppy seed muffin? Yes, sir. Well, Poppy wants one 'cause Mommy already got hers."
[18:04:46] <taplar> o_O
[18:04:52] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:05:03] <cangelosx> taplar: right, which brings to the original question. do I need to backslash the parenthesis
[18:05:06] <cangelosx> err
[18:05:08] <cangelosx> square brackets
[18:05:10] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:05:20] <taplar> lol
[18:05:23] <robertmaxrees> as taplar explained, using the quotes around the attribute value will do that for you.
[18:05:35] <taplar> and, imho, is more readable
[18:05:43] <cangelosx> i agree
[18:05:56] <robertmaxrees> there are some cases where the quote trick doesn't work.
[18:06:12] <robertmaxrees> i also might rethink selecting on the name attribute, but that's a different story.
[18:06:59] <cangelosx> i knew you were gonna say that lol
[18:07:05] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:07:07] <cangelosx> i have little control over the markup
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> then use .filter()
[18:07:13] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[18:07:14] <robertmaxrees> yaaaay
[18:07:21] <cangelosx> how do you mean?
[18:07:39] <Velveeta> you have as much control as you wish..... all you have to do, is believe in yourself... <waves a magic wand and leaves glittery sparkles in the air as he enunciates>
[18:07:48] <robertmaxrees> $('.yerInputs').filter(function() { return this.name === 'any string here';  });
[18:08:00] * taplar eyes Velveeta
[18:08:05] <taplar> what was in that muffin...
[18:08:17] * Velveeta throws glittery sprinkles at taplar.
[18:08:18] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: how is that any faster than selecting by name attribute?
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> less about speed, more about readability, but since you asked!
[18:08:50] <cangelosx> Velveeta: well, technically, I have full control, but forms and their inputs are dynamically generated in a way that doesn't allow custom classes or id attributes
[18:09:02] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors use sizzle's engine to try to find stuff, which can be very slow.  filter, on the other hand, is looking at DOM nodes and has some other optimizations applied to it.
[18:09:07] <Velveeta> believe in yourself! <magic wand thing again>
[18:09:32] <Velveeta> i just poured my first whiskey o' da ev'nin
[18:09:46] <Velveeta> although if you're gonna blame my behavior on that, i haven't actually taken a sip yet
[18:09:51] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: so that clusterfuck is more readable than selecting by name?
[18:10:07] <taplar> i'm just in awe of the actions of the fake cheese
[18:10:10] <cangelosx> Velveeta: my desktop password is whisky
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> i think it's more readable, and i diagree that it's a clusterfuck.
[18:10:15] <cangelosx> i probably shouldn't have told you that
[18:10:18] <robertmaxrees> but hey, if you want to get snarky.
[18:10:30] <cangelosx> it was a question
[18:10:34] <Velveeta> now all i have to do is figure out all the other private details of your live, and i can track you down and unlock your desktop
[18:10:56] <cangelosx> if i was snarky I'd just say that clusterfuck is no where as readable as a single line
[18:11:05] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:11:12] <robertmaxrees> really getting sick of people's attitudes lately.
[18:11:17] <cangelosx> you know
[18:11:32] <cangelosx> if you meet an asshole, they're probably an asshole. you meet a lot of assholes, maybe you're the asshole
[18:11:37] <Velveeta> $('attitude').not(':robertmaxrees').remove()
[18:11:43] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.  cool.
[18:11:44] <cangelosx> don't get me wrong; I'm appreciative of all the help
[18:11:46] <robertmaxrees> have fun then.
[18:11:51] <robertmaxrees> no, you're not.
[18:11:57] <robertmaxrees> oh wait, maybe i'm just an asshole.
[18:12:30] <cangelosx> maybe it's something about javascript that makes coder snobby
[18:12:31] * Velveeta puts on his best Kevin Spacey impression and says "and like that" <blows on fingers> "he's gone"
[18:12:40] <cangelosx> coders*
[18:12:49] <cangelosx> i dont mean any of this in a hateful way
[18:12:58] <cangelosx> just an honest observation
[18:13:36] * Velveeta flashes a yellow card in cangelosx's direction.
[18:13:50] <taplar> and moving on is a great idea
[18:14:03] <Velveeta> mos def
[18:14:17] <Velveeta> i finally gave notice at my job a week and a half ago
[18:14:24] <taplar> oh?
[18:14:30] <Velveeta> yep, almost 5 years here
[18:15:15] <taplar> been at this place 8 years
[18:15:24] <Velveeta> and let me tell you, the drama i've faced this week has been fucking soap-opera-level
[18:15:31] <taplar> ?
[18:15:49] <Velveeta> one stubborn engineer
[18:15:53] <graphettion_> 8 years :O That's like a black hole
[18:16:03] <taplar> heh
[18:16:24] <taplar> i haven't been doing the same thing all 8 years, but yeah
[18:16:36] <Velveeta> but i'll be moving on to bazaarvoice now, and going to work on an enormous codebase of theirs
[18:17:10] <Velveeta> i'll actually get eyes on some of slexaxton's work, and probably be like "whoa, what? wtf?" because it's years old now and none of what we write stands the test of time
[18:17:51] <SlexAxton> totally untrue
[18:17:51] <Velveeta> meanwhile, people will be picking apart everything i leave behind at my current company, saying "whoa, what? wtf?"
[18:17:56] <SlexAxton> i'm sure it's allllll still gold
[18:18:12] <Velveeta> well, you make an excellent point, since it's your code
[18:18:27] <taplar> *shrug* if that's true, it's their fault for allowing silos to develop
[18:18:36] <graphettion_> taplar, I'm just messing with you. That's actually pretty cool.
[18:18:53] <Velveeta> i find silos to be inevitable in applications or organizations of a sufficient size
[18:19:02] <Velveeta> if you mean discipline silos
[18:19:10] <taplar> i mean knowledge silos
[18:19:31] <taplar> if only one guy knows something about a company or applicaiton, terrible
[18:19:36] <Velveeta> ahhhhh yes... i've spent the last 2 days writing up swaths of documentation to store in our wiki so the people that take over my project know wtf they're doing
[18:20:18] <ajpiano> Velveeta SlexAxton lolz woah congrats
[18:20:32] <Velveeta> heeeeey it's adam!
[18:20:36] <Velveeta> and thanks :)
[18:20:50] * taplar hides in the corner from people he doesn't know
[18:21:22] <Velveeta> ajpiano and slexaxton help organize our txjs conference each year... near and dear to my heart because it's one of the only recurring local conferences :D
[18:21:40] <ajpiano> s/each/every other :p
[18:21:40] <b-ot> Correction, <Velveeta> ajpiano and slexaxton help organize our txjs conference every other :p year... near and dear to my heart because it's one of the only recurring local conferences :D
[18:21:46] * graphettion_ pats taplar on the head
[18:21:49] <Velveeta> well, something like that
[18:21:52] <ajpiano> :D
[18:30:25] <taplar> wish we had more local cons in the rock.  i think maybe the only con we have might have been a game/comic one
[18:32:14] <Velveeta> the rock? ....do you live in alcatraz?
[18:32:28] <taplar> well, heh, "live"
[18:32:40] <taplar> little rock
[18:33:28] <Velveeta> ok, that sounds..... worse?
[18:33:36] <taplar> *shrugs*
[18:33:41] <Velveeta> :D
[18:35:50] <taplar> i've yet to be to another place that I was like "I must move here!"  well, except for nevada with their 0 humidity
[18:36:24] <taplar> fk, not there, arizona
[18:36:35] <taplar> clearly it left an impression, heh
[18:37:57] <Velveeta> yeah, the wife and i should have this house paid off, and our kid out of it, in about 5 years, so we're constantly contemplating where to move to
[18:38:12] <Velveeta> nothing quite grabs us like austin does, as much as we'd love to find someplace new that had the same appeal
[18:38:49] <Velveeta> the tech boom here, and associated income levels, coupled with the relatively low cost of living compared to other regions in the US, is a huge factor
[18:39:59] <taplar> is it texas that has no sales tax, but crazy property tax?
[18:46:22] <Velveeta> nope, we have 8.25% sales tax
[18:46:35] <Velveeta> not sure what our property tax rate is, except for churches, i know what their property tax rate is
[18:46:45] <taplar> lol
