[01:13:51] <kirua> i use ajax to get some data when an input field is filled up, but i need to send that to javascript function in document.ready, how to do it ?
[01:14:44] <Cork> kirua: uh, you mean the function is defined inside the callback function given to .ready?
[01:14:49] <Cork> or what do you mean "send"
[01:16:11] <kirua> im making a paste code
[01:16:22] <kirua> pastebin*
[01:16:27] <Cork> make it jsfiddle when your at it
[01:17:20] <slax0r> picky :)
[01:19:29] <Uhkis> tons of ads and uneditable non-live code vs. no ads and live editable and runnable code
[01:19:56] <Uhkis> yeah, why would anyone use fiddle instead of pastebin ;-)
[01:20:11] <Cork> :)
[01:26:11] <rzeka> What is JS event to hook to required form fields validation? I've tried on submit, but it doesn't work when there are invalid fields
[01:26:50] <Uhkis> change is pretty good
[01:28:03] <Cork> rzeka: there is the invalid event
[01:28:10] <rzeka> thx Cork
[01:28:25] <kirua> basically, i'm using datepicker() and instead of just displaying a calendar for the user to pick a date, i want to highlight some dates but those depends on what the user has previously selected in inputs in the same form, so i user ajax in order to retrieve the dates in the form of a json array but then i don't know how to use it, i came up with this : http://pastebin.com/h46wd7XH
[01:28:43] * Cork hands the ads to uhk
[01:28:48] <Cork> *Uhkis
[01:29:00] <Uhkis> no way!
[01:29:57] <Cork> man this ie10 bug drives me nuts...
[01:35:46] <kirua> Cork, any idea?
[01:39:37] <Uhkis> kirua: try again at jsfiddle.net
[01:40:15] <Tumulte> hello people
[01:41:18] <Tumulte> I got a very old jquery (1.4, mh...) that has bugs like html is not a function, addClass is not a function. I can't ask you to give me magical answers, but I bet you have some tips to help me debug that
[01:41:52] <Cork> Tumulte: are you using jQuery or $?
[01:41:54] <Uhkis> Tumulte: are you sure you have only one instance of jquery?
[01:42:00] <Cork> sounds like $ isn't jquery
[01:42:05] <Tumulte> Cork: $
[01:42:15] <Cork> then try with jQuery
[01:42:16] <Tumulte> Uhkis: checking
[01:42:23] <Cork> jQuery() that is
[01:43:20] <Cork> $.fn.jquery === '1.4.<something>' if $ really is jquery
[01:43:58] <Tumulte> Uhkis: well, how do I make sure of that ?
[01:44:04] <Cork> multiple instances of jquery doesn't matter
[01:44:16] <Cork> it isn't the cause
[01:44:47] <Cork> cause .html has existed on jquery since 1.0
[01:45:12] <Uhkis> Tumulte: do you use firebug?
[01:45:26] <Tumulte> of course
[01:45:36] <Uhkis> go to console, type $
[01:45:55] <Uhkis> that should be a fast check for what Cork suggested
[01:45:58] <Cork> firebug defines $ by default
[01:46:11] <Uhkis> it's undefined on mine
[01:46:12] <Cork> so ya, make sure to use jQuery there
[01:46:33] <Cork> it can be disabled in the options
[01:46:48] <Cork> but by default it is a shorthand for document.getElementById
[01:47:57] <Uhkis> oh, i guess drupal unsets $ then
[01:49:09] <Tumulte> Cork: $'s ok on firebug
[01:49:09] <Cork> Uhkis: https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Command_Line_API#.24.28selector.29
[01:49:29] <Cork> Tumulte: $.fn.jquery is defined?
[01:50:05] <Tumulte> "1.4.2"
[01:50:06] <Tumulte> yes
[01:50:15] <Cork> ok, so where do you get the error?
[01:50:31] <Cork> you might try to use jquery before it is loaded
[01:51:54] <Uhkis> console.log($); before trying html() etc?
[02:01:41] <Tumulte> mh. We'll not get the outcome of this
[02:01:47] <kirua> hi
[02:01:53] <Tumulte> my colleague just decided to downgrad jq
[02:01:56] <kirua> here is the jsfiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/Aut9b/371/
[02:10:53] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3c2awezu/1/ <--- can you help me combine these?
[02:11:46] <Kartagis> kirua: wait a sec while I'm fetching my crystall ball
[02:14:05] <kirua> thx Kartagis
[02:14:47] <Kartagis> oh, I was being sarcastic. tell us what the issue is
[02:16:28] <kirua> basically, i'm using datepicker() and instead of just displaying a calendar for the user to pick a date, i want to highlight some dates but those depends on what the user has previously selected in inputs in the same form, so i user ajax in order to retrieve the dates in the form of a json array but then i don't know how to use it

[04:09:39] <laravelnewbie> hi i want to set up lang to 'fr' for each select2 inputs? im on version 4.0.0 and i dont found a solution.. someone has an idea ?
[04:13:14] <Kartagis> select has lang?
[04:19:54] <guessx> laravelnewbie, not entirely sure what you mean, but i did a site with a few different languages, i split the language files up loaded them all via headers and then select switched thru them and applied the selected
[04:21:53] <laravelnewbie> i want set up lang statically
[04:22:06] <laravelnewbie> not in each select2
[04:22:56] <laravelnewbie> do you understand ?
[04:24:20] <laravelnewbie> i dont want set "language: 'fr' " on each inputs because i have many inputs . I want to add fr language once for each
[04:24:25] <laravelnewbie> guessx
[04:26:56] <guessx> i dont quite understand, just reading documentation on it
[04:29:55] <morphyeys> Hello guys, I am having ~ 100 options with attribute data-image="img/blank.gif" I want to change the value of data-image on all of the options to "/assets/img/blank.gif" how can I do that?
[04:31:10] <Cork> morphyeys: you have to loop the elements
[04:31:26] <morphyeys> yeah it's obvious, but I don't know how to change the value of that attribute
[04:31:45] <taplar> data('image', newvalue)
[04:32:03] <Cork> $('option').each(function() { $(this).data('image', $(this).data('image').replace(/^/, '/assets/')); });
[04:32:21] <taplar> laravelnewbie: from the github page. 'Select2 supports multiple languages by simply including the right language JS file (dist/js/i18n/it.js, dist/js/i18n/nl.js, etc.) after dist/js/select2.js.'  did you try that?
[04:32:45] <laravelnewbie> taplar but it takes 'en' by default
[04:32:49] <laravelnewbie> yes*
[04:36:10] <taplar> are you also including the en one?
[04:52:59] <morphyeys> thanks!
[04:54:45] <hellyeah> is there something to get element from other DOM
[04:54:53] <hellyeah> each page has a DOM right
[04:55:15] <Cork> hellyeah: depends on what you mean by "other dom"
[04:57:51] <hellyeah> i have a.aspx and b.aspx
[04:58:50] <hellyeah> i wanna use some elements from a.aspx in b.aspx sorry if my question doeesnt makesense
[04:58:58] <hellyeah> ?
[04:59:13] <Uhkis> just $.get() it and select what you need
[04:59:16] <Cork> hellyeah: you would have to fetch the content of a to do that
[04:59:28] <Cork> the dom only exist after you've parsed the html content
[04:59:43] <Cork> .load is an option
[04:59:50] <Cork> ?api load
[04:59:50] <b-ot> Cork: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[05:00:43] <hellyeah> yea i will have related DOM
[05:02:08] <taplar> seems like your talking about a view/tile that both pages would use
[05:06:02] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3c2awezu/1/ <--- can you help me combine these?
[05:11:11] <Narhir> Hey Guys, I'm having problems with my script on mobile devices
[05:11:29] <Narhir> 79level.com/dogform/dogtag.html
[05:12:09] <Woet> are you gonna tell us the problems?
[05:12:11] <Narhir> the problem is that it limits number of characters but you can still type in as much text as you want... but it should be limited to 13 characters (it works on desktop properly but not on mobile)
[05:12:22] <Narhir> was writing the problem down :)
[05:12:54] <Narhir> http://www.79level.com/dogform/dogtag.js
[05:16:39] <guessx> instead of data why not attr?
[05:17:26] <Narhir> I tried both
[05:17:30] <Narhir> I mena
[05:17:35] <Narhir> I mean... what you mean ?
[05:18:14] <guessx> var maxlength = $(this).data('maxlength');
[05:19:16] <Cork> Narhir: don't use keyup
[05:19:22] <Cork> it only fires when a key is let go
[05:19:30] <Cork> (it won't catch repetitions)
[05:19:37] <Cork> use the input event instead
[05:19:50] <Narhir> uhm.. well not sure how else to write it that is the issue
[05:20:11] <Cork> $('input').on('input', func)
[05:20:19] <Narhir> shoudl I write: var maxlength = $(this).attr('maxlength'); ? not even sure if that would work
[05:20:41] <Cork> you should
[05:21:54] <Narhir> I changed the keyup into on and it doesnt work anymore.. heh :/
[05:23:33] <Cork> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/
[05:23:42] <Cork> also don't put tag names infront of ids
[05:23:48] <Cork> (forgot to remove that...)
[05:25:18] <Narhir> so just #line1 ?
[05:25:24] <Narhir> it looks amazing
[05:25:28] <Narhir> thank you so much Cork
[05:25:30] <Narhir> cork++
[05:25:31] <hellyeah> #
[05:25:35] <hellyeah> for id
[05:25:37] <Cork> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/1/
[05:25:45] <Cork> Narhir: also you should use classes more
[05:25:56] <Cork> those ids should be a single class instead
[05:26:17] <hellyeah> i guess i need to learn prototypes
[05:26:51] <Cork> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/2/
[05:27:15] <Narhir> hm
[05:27:25] <Narhir> and adding .line class instead of multiple ids ?
[05:27:29] <Cork> yes
[05:27:41] <Cork> data-ref is for the reference to the class number
[05:27:58] <Cork> though as you add the value to the target
[05:28:16] <Cork> it looks line line-output-<number> should be an id instead
[05:28:38] <Cork> (classes are for groups, and ids for unique elements)
[05:29:30] <Narhir> hmmm
[05:29:40] <Cork> and when we're at it, the input handler uses loads of variables when only using the output once
[05:29:50] <Cork> actually, no i read wrong there
[05:30:07] <Narhir> now I got confused
[05:30:13] <Cork> one min
[05:30:18] <Narhir> :)
[05:30:21] <Narhir> your helping me a ton
[05:31:15] <Cork> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/3/
[05:31:25] <Cork> that is at least what i think you're trying to do
[05:31:47] <Cork> hmm opps
[05:32:04] <Cork> bug http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/4/
[05:33:47] <Narhir> :)
[05:34:16] <Narhir> testing
[05:34:31] <Narhir> now it doesn't work.
[05:34:47] <Cork> note i replaced that #line with a class
[05:35:06] <Narhir> ah
[05:35:16] <Cork> and i replaced the line-output- i converted to an id
[05:35:24] <Cork> * and the line-output- i converted to an id
[05:38:01] <Narhir> yeah
[05:38:09] <Narhir> the class into id made it not working
[05:38:12] <Narhir> but I turned my classes to id
[05:38:30] <Cork> (that was what it intended you to do :) )
[05:38:49] <Cork> i don't have your html so i'm only guessing from the code, so i might be wrong
[05:39:39] <Narhir> you could view the html in there I suppose
[05:39:42] <Narhir> as in on the website
[05:39:45] <Narhir> but thank you so much
[05:39:49] <Narhir> it as driving me crazy a bit
[05:40:02] <Narhir> my input looks like that:
[05:40:03] <Narhir> <input class="line" name="line1" placeholder="Line 1" maxlength="13" data-maxlength="14" android:maxLength="13" data-ref="1">
[05:40:07] <Narhir> I think I have to many attributes...
[05:40:21] <Cork> android:maxLength ??
[05:40:26] <Narhir> I tought it would work ;p
[05:40:40] <Cork> and the data-maxlength you should remove
[05:40:45] <Cork> +too
[05:41:00] <Cork> <input class="line" name="line1" placeholder="Line 1" maxlength="13" data-ref="1">
[05:41:51] <Narhir> ok there is one more issue...
[05:42:08] <Cork> hmm
[05:42:22] <Narhir> becaue I tested it on "firefox" mobile browser
[05:42:24] <Cork> ugg i missed that maxlength actually blocks the length
[05:42:30] <Narhir> and it doesnt update when typing but only when I finish typing
[05:42:33] <Cork> so the length limit is needed
[05:42:42] <Narhir> which lenght limit ?
[05:43:18] <Narhir> you mean I should leave data-maxlength ?
[05:43:27] <Cork> no
[05:43:35] <Cork> data-maxlength has no effect
[05:43:43] <Cork> maxlength blocks input by default
[05:43:46] <Cork> you don't need js for that
[05:44:17] <Narhir> actually it was not blocking the input on android devices ... :/
[05:45:17] <Cork> ya, cause maxlength isn't supported by the browser
[05:45:39] <Cork> it messed with me cause i didn't notice that
[05:46:55] <Cork> Narhir: there fixed http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/5/
[05:47:10] <Cork> opps left the console.log
[05:47:19] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/6/
[05:49:23] <Narhir> I'm so silly
[05:49:28] <Narhir> I tought it was meant to bei n there: )
[05:49:31] <Narhir> :)
[05:49:39] <Narhir> like this was what fixed the not working on firefox browser
[05:52:08] <Narhir> actually..
[05:52:18] <Narhir> wheneverI  type 14 characters instead of 13.. it removes all what I wrote..
[05:52:24] <Narhir> on mobile device in firefox browser
[05:52:57] <Cork> uhh
[05:53:07] <Cork> are you sure you got the last fiddle?
[05:53:14] <Cork> cause i can't reproduce that here
[05:54:57] <Cork> ah, now i can
[05:55:02] <Cork> interesting browser bug
[05:57:30] <Narhir> is there anyhting we could do about it Cork ?
[05:57:34] <Narhir> I have no idea personally :/
[05:57:49] <Cork> sure there is, i'm trying to figure out what is going wrong first though
[05:58:57] <arup_r> I want to open a box when clicked on a link.. and another click will close it. That is fine. ( http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/KdzWyZ) .. But I want any click outside the open box should close it too..
[05:59:04] <arup_r> How to do it >
[05:59:05] <arup_r> ?
[05:59:09] <Cork> i'm quite surprised fennec doesn't support maxlength to be honest
[06:01:02] <Narhir> it is very strange issue
[06:01:58] <Cork> O_o
[06:02:11] <Cork> when the input field hits maxlength .val() is ""
[06:02:14] <Cork> weird...
[06:02:25] <Narhir> magic happens :)
[06:02:33] <Narhir> the text disapears
[06:02:52] <Narhir> but I think one of earlier verson was not causing it
[06:04:08] <Narhir> maybe this substr is causing the issue
[06:05:03] <arup_r> So.. you people wouldn't help me .. Is this right? :( :)
[06:05:25] <Cork> Narhir: no it seams to be the setting of val from inside the input event
[06:05:43] <Cork> arup_r: just ask the question and wait
[06:06:00] <Narhir> hm
[06:06:01] <arup_r> ok sure I asked.. now I will be waiting
[06:06:33] <Kartagis> I want to crop an uploaded picture. I've got http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/3c2awezu/2/ but I'm not sure how to act next. can you help?
[06:07:28] <Cork> Narhir: ya... .substr works fine
[06:07:38] <Cork> it is the setting of the string that borks things
[06:07:42] <Cork> really really weird
[06:11:10] <Cork> Narhir: ok, i must admit that bug confuses me profoundly
[06:11:17] <Cork> can't even understand what happens there...
[06:11:21] <Narhir> :///
[06:11:23] <Narhir> ok I understand
[06:11:29] <Cork> i would file a bug about it
[06:11:29] <Narhir> thank you for your outstanding help eitherway
[06:11:33] <Cork> cause this looks really really broken
[06:11:50] <Narhir> https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1&qpcustomb=1 I think only 2% of people are actually using this.. browser
[06:11:57] <Cork> hmm there is one more thing i could try
[06:15:33] <Narhir> I'm open for suggestions if you have any :)
[06:16:48] <Cork> i'm trying to reduce it a bit
[06:16:53] <Cork> but it confuses the hell out of me
[06:17:38] <Narhir> I suppose it may frustrate users... writing on mobile and the text they wrote disapearing :P
[06:20:03] <Cork> Narhir: well the code your working with here isn't very common
[06:20:20] <Cork> normally you get a validation error instead of it activly stripping it out of the field
[06:20:25] <Narhir> well thats right  :/
[06:20:58] <Cork> but ya this triggers it http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/25/
[06:21:04] <Cork> and i can't see why it would...
[06:21:13] <Cork> makes no sense to me
[06:21:36] <Narhir> :/
[06:21:56] <Narhir> I was thinking that maybe it is caunting 0 as 1.. or substracting turns everythink into 0...
[06:22:16] <Narhir> but I cant think of anything else
[06:22:24] <Narhir> hmm
[06:22:29] <Narhir> maybe I will install ebta version of firefox browser
[06:22:47] <Cork> hack even http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/26/ triggers it
[06:23:19] <Cork> no it is taking the value in the input cropping it and setting it again completely breaks fennec...
[06:25:03] <Narhir> it works in firefox beta
[06:25:04] <Narhir> .....
[06:25:13] <Tenoke> bah, anyone know how the hell can I check if an input[type='password'] field has been prepopulated by the browser?
[06:25:28] <Tenoke> .val() reports that its empty even when it isn't until you actually click on the damn field
[06:25:36] <Cork> Narhir: are you talking about beta for mobile (fennec) or desktop?
[06:25:45] <Narhir> mobile
[06:25:47] <Cork> (it is why i keep calling it it's old name)
[06:26:07] <Cork> so it is a bug and they have fixed it...
[06:26:15] <Narhir> apparently so
[06:26:15] <Narhir> :)
[06:26:24] <Narhir> but didnt pushed it to the normal distro
[06:26:36] <Cork> no beta means it is on the way out
[06:27:05] <Cork> Narhir: btw did you test http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/26/ or an older version?
[06:27:41] <Narhir> I tested my website: http://www.79level.com/dogform/dogtag.html
[06:27:48] <Cork> try that fiddle
[06:28:05] <Cork> else you might just hit the maxlength implementation
[06:28:06] <Narhir> ok
[06:29:38] <Narhir> nothing happens on my mobile
[06:29:41] <Narhir> with this jsfiddle
[06:29:59] <Cork> what do you mean?
[06:30:13] <Cork> it gets to 10 and stops?
[06:30:28] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/oed8mea0/29/ <-- this provs it has little to do with jquery
[06:30:41] <Cork> ^ it still breaks for me on release
[06:31:10] <Cork> i don't have beta so can't test it there
[06:37:35] <Narhir> :/
[06:37:42] <Narhir> I understand
[06:37:54] <Narhir> and regarding to the text.. it doesnt display the text
[06:38:24] <Narhir> buuut the .26 stops after 10th letter
[06:40:45] <Cork> Narhir: ya, i'm talking with the developers right now
[06:47:17] <Cork> Narhir: it gets better, they couldn't reproduce it in the same release version :/
[06:47:50] <Cork> Narhir: the sad part is i have no idea of a workaround
[06:48:04] <Cork> as you can't touch the value in the field...
[06:49:23] <Narhir> no worries.
[06:49:27] <Narhir> I will just have to wait
[06:49:31] <Narhir> untill the beta release
[06:59:31] <krambiorix> hi, when using datatables, i want to replace one table row. This doesn't work: fiTable.fnUpdate( $(myrowinhtml), $('tr.file[data-id="'+data['id']+'"]') )... Can anyone tell me why it doesn't work?
[07:08:14] <stelt> where's the list translating a name to a URL for require?
[07:10:54] <arup_r> I want to open a box when clicked on a link.. and another click will close it. That is fine. ( http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/KdzWyZ) .. But I want any click outside the open box should close it too.. How to do it ?
[07:25:41] <monk3y> arup_r: still there?
[07:25:47] <arup_r> I want to close the red box if someone click on the link or any where outside of the red box. If I click on link it is closing.. but if I click on the other places nothing happening
[07:25:49] <arup_r> http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/KdzWyZ
[07:25:53] <monk3y> I guess you are :)
[07:25:54] <arup_r> monk3y: humm :D
[07:26:17] <monk3y> I think I've done it.  I haven't used CodePen much before, and I've written it in the link you sent - so if I save it, will it overwrite your work?
[07:26:46] <arup_r> monk3y: I think you can't save my codepen.. but you can fork it
[07:26:56] <arup_r> fork mine one
[07:27:02] <monk3y> Right.  Here 'tis.  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VvabQb
[07:27:09] <arup_r> ok
[07:27:45] <arup_r> monk3y: \o/
[07:28:06] <arup_r> How to see console in codepen ?
[07:28:11] <monk3y> Sorry to just 'give' you the answer.  Takes all the mystery out of it.
[07:28:31] <monk3y> The console is your console.  So however you open dev-tools on your browser of choice.
[07:29:06] <arup_r> monk3y: some people told me there also we have console but where I don't know
[07:30:45] * monk3y shrugs dramatically
[07:31:03] <monk3y> Not sure!  But the browser's console seems to have everything in it for me.
[07:31:06] * arup_r shrugs to
[07:31:13] * arup_r shrugs tooo
[07:31:38] <arup_r> Yeah! I will use browser console..
[07:31:52] <arup_r> thought of there.. to play then paste the code to my codebase
[07:39:06] <hellyeah> hey
[07:39:18] <ceterizine> hell yeah
[07:39:23] <ceterizine> hell yeah batman
[07:39:54] <hellyeah> i am using localstorage for getting the same appearence after refreshing my page is refreshed in one min. when page refresh, DOM is generated again when you use localstorage
[07:40:28] <hellyeah> hope you got my question
[07:43:02] <arup_r> monk3y: If we have more than one <div> inside a target/container <div> then ?
[07:43:07] <arup_r> I do have like that
[07:50:28] <arup_r> event.target.attr("class") is throwing me error.. How to read the attribute value of the target node ?
[07:52:06] <Xatenev> arup_r: attr is jquery
[07:52:09] <Xatenev> event.targte is js
[07:52:17] <Xatenev> try $(event.target).attr("class");

[07:59:52] <n00bdev> how do i show more than 1 active element?
[08:01:03] <n00bdev> basically i have 2 pairs of sub-radio buttons. 1 from each pair is selected by default. Clicking on one of the main radio buttons will show input for one but not the other
[08:02:30] <mdg> Hello, is it possible to set an http header Location: ... for an ajax request, and cause that entire page to be redirected ?
[08:11:36] <arup_r> In JS `undefined` means false ?
[08:14:29] <mdg> arup_r: undefined is "falsey"
[08:14:45] <arup_r> ok
[09:29:41] <n00bdev> any jquery masters here?

[09:33:20] <n00bdev> http://jsfiddle.net/97dj07mq/8/
[09:33:22] <n00bdev> so
[09:33:40] <n00bdev> i have 2 pairs of sub radio buttons under tender and price
[09:34:05] <n00bdev> 1 of the buttons in each pair is selected by default
[09:34:45] <n00bdev> tender shows inputs fine, but if u click on price, it does not show the input unless u change the sub-radio button
[09:35:10] <n00bdev> and if u go back to tender the field dissapears and doesnt show unitl u click around again
[09:35:51] <n00bdev> the jquery object selector returns both checked fields, but only wants to show one. how do i get the other one to show?
[09:36:53] <mdg> n00bdev: radio buttons, by definition, only allow 1 to be selected at a time
[09:37:04] <n00bdev> right
[09:37:12] <n00bdev> but the 2 pairs are different
[09:37:29] <n00bdev> so each pair can have one be selected by default
[09:37:36] <robertmaxrees> }).get().join(',')); wat
[09:37:48] <n00bdev> hi robert! lol
[09:38:03] <robertmaxrees> what're you confusedf about?
[09:38:33] <n00bdev> like i said above
[09:38:46] <n00bdev> there are 2 default selected sub-radio buttons
[09:39:03] <n00bdev> one is displayed, but other doesnt when i switch to it form the main radio button
[09:39:15] <n00bdev> start from tender
[09:39:17] <n00bdev> then go to price
[09:39:20] <robertmaxrees> we had this all working yesterday.
[09:39:30] <mdg> heh
[09:39:42] <robertmaxrees> at least partially.
[09:39:47] <n00bdev> partially yes
[09:39:55] <robertmaxrees> so then why didn't you extend that idea?
[09:39:59] <n00bdev> i did
[09:39:59] <robertmaxrees> like - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/97dj07mq/2/
[09:40:02] <robertmaxrees> partially done here.
[09:40:24] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're making it more complicated than need be,.
[09:42:32] <robertmaxrees> have you run through learn.jquery.com yet?
[09:43:42] <n00bdev> no i was working to fix this
[09:44:07] <robertmaxrees> so i'd give a run through on that.
[09:44:10] <robertmaxrees> should clear up a lot for you.
[09:44:18] <n00bdev> how long would it take?
[09:44:25] <robertmaxrees> as long as you want it to?
[09:44:30] <robertmaxrees> like... take some time to learn the basics.
[09:46:29] <n00bdev> this is so weird
[09:46:43] <n00bdev> on fiddle its displaying the 2 inputs
[09:46:47] <n00bdev> but on my site it doesnt
[09:46:54] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com
[09:53:13] <dimi1947> there is something that bothers me...when a link is clicked in a search result...do you think is it better to bring the result with ajax or or no ajax...I am builiding an app whern user searches through user profiles...I am asking about your personal opinion
[09:53:35] <robertmaxrees> it depends on what all clicking the result does, the target audience, devices, etc.
[09:53:47] <robertmaxrees> like, there's no "one size fits all" solution.  not even a "one size fits most".
[09:54:01] <robertmaxrees> is the rest of the app using ajax with some kind of client-side templating setup?
[09:54:46] <dimi1947> many aspects of the site use ajax....there is no template
[09:54:56] <robertmaxrees> so are you loading any other full pages using ajax?
[09:55:27] <dimi1947> no....the pages are loaded with the traditional way...no -ajax
[09:55:50] <dimi1947> but in order to edit the content of these pages I use ajax
[09:56:32] <dimi1947> you mentioned...target audience and devices...can you elaborate a little?
[09:57:00] <dimi1947> so I can make a sound decision
[09:57:59] <robertmaxrees> back up - what makes your search results special compared to every other page?
[09:58:12] <robertmaxrees> why are you considering loading those via ajax but not anything else?
[09:58:43] <dimi1947> I suppose that with ajax I might be able to add some interactivity
[09:58:49] <dimi1947> for example....
[09:58:52] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:58:57] <robertmaxrees> you want to load a page.
[10:00:22] <dimi1947> I am thinking that when the user clicks a search link...which directs to a profile...I would like a sidebar to open that will display all the relevant info...and as such ajax might neede to accomplish that
[10:00:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not a search page then.
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> that's a quickview - and those suck.
[10:00:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid doing that.
[10:01:05] <dimi1947> why...
[10:01:19] <robertmaxrees> it adds an extra layer of unnecessary interaction to your page.
[10:01:27] <robertmaxrees> more shit for the user to get tripped up on.
[10:01:42] <robertmaxrees> make the default display in search cleaner, or fix your product page.
[10:02:11] <dimi1947> ok...then....that was my argument for using ajax...
[10:02:37] <robertmaxrees> so your real question was "should i create a quickview for my search pages?"
[10:02:56] <dimi1947> something like that...
[10:03:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[10:03:09] <robertmaxrees> http://baymard.com/blog/ecommerce-quick-views
[10:03:14] <robertmaxrees> a good article on the subject./
[10:03:27] <dimi1947> as I see....since you recommend avoiding this...then I guess there is no need for ajax
[10:03:34] <dimi1947> but....
[10:03:41] <dimi1947> ]and there is a but...
[10:03:50] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating ajax as a technique and ajax as a tool.
[10:04:04] <dimi1947> myspace search results....are fetched with ajax
[10:04:16] <robertmaxrees> great for myspace.
[10:04:20] <robertmaxrees> they're not an ecommerce site.
[10:04:34] <dimi1947> I am not making an e-commerce site
[10:04:44] <robertmaxrees> what're you making then?
[10:04:55] <dimi1947> a booking app...
[10:05:11] <dimi1947> it will contain profiles of businesses
[10:05:24] <robertmaxrees> okay - so let's back up then - you're conflating ajax as a technique with ajax as a tool.
[10:05:53] <dimi1947> and the intention was/is to portray the search results with ajax
[10:06:00] <dimi1947> the profiles I meant
[10:06:29] <robertmaxrees> your question seems much more relevant to a UI consideration at that point.
[10:06:54] <robertmaxrees> I don't see any reason to use that kind of UI - there's a reason you don't see that kind of UI often.
[10:07:58] <dimi1947> yes you are right it is a UI issue
[10:08:15] <dimi1947> why I do not see this UI often?
[10:08:43] <robertmaxrees> think about it.
[10:09:01] <robertmaxrees> users are trained to click and go to a separate page.  that other page has all the information they want in that context.
[10:09:08] <robertmaxrees> it's also a link they can share.
[10:10:03] <dimi1947> Yes I understand....well my reasoning for that was that I want to build a sidebar for the site
[10:10:35] <dimi1947> and profiles would be portrayed there...
[10:10:49] <robertmaxrees> eeeehhhh...
[10:13:02] <n00bdev> robert
[10:13:39] <dimi1947> I am not a designer...though...I will hire one for the job
[10:15:09] <n00bdev> https://jsfiddle.net/97dj07mq/10/
[10:15:22] <n00bdev> ive made changes to html to reflect the problem im trying to solve
[10:16:07] <n00bdev> ive placed data-inputfields on the sub-radio button groups and ull see what im talking about
[10:16:20] <robertmaxrees> so tender works, yeah?
[10:16:42] <n00bdev> yeha
[10:16:45] <n00bdev> not price
[10:17:05] <n00bdev> and price has a selected default too
[10:17:14] <robertmaxrees> so what's the difference between the two?
[10:18:05] <n00bdev> different class inputs
[10:18:08] <n00bdev> but other than that
[10:18:20] <n00bdev> i used data-inputfield for price also
[10:18:23] <robertmaxrees> so did you run through fixingthesejquery.com ?
[10:18:29] <n00bdev> yes
[10:18:46] <Utils> What's it called when you hover over long text and it scrolls to the end of the text and back to the start?
[10:21:33] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/97dj07mq/11/
[10:23:40] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[10:24:49] <Milos> Did I find a bug or what?
[10:24:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:25:12] <Milos> http://puu.sh/keC3D/b43120c0ea.png
[10:25:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:25:27] <Milos> when I run that snippet in my code, it still gives me the two commas
[10:25:31] <Milos> when I run it manually, it works fine...
[10:25:38] <robertmaxrees> make a quick fiddle?
[10:26:01] <Milos> argh, I don't think I can
[10:26:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:26:08] <Milos> uses a lot of stuff
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[10:26:15] <robertmaxrees> that example doesn';t.
[10:26:17] <robertmaxrees> it's 2 lines.
[10:26:36] <Milos> that's because it's the output..
[10:26:41] <Milos> it's run in a closure part of a template in typeahead, which itself uses other deps
[10:26:45] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[10:27:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't want any of that.
[10:27:10] <Milos> :)
[10:27:16] <robertmaxrees> nor do i need it.
[10:27:21] <n00bdev> robert are you referring to the console.log output?
[10:27:32] <n00bdev> line for line our jquery is same
[10:27:38] <robertmaxrees> n00bdev that'll help guide you.  your selectors are off.  that's what it looks like to me.
[10:28:09] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 you can literally just give me those two lines.
[10:28:12] <robertmaxrees> not your whole setup.
[10:28:28] <robertmaxrees> also, what's with the Boolean in there?
[10:30:07] <Milos> robertmaxrees, it works fine in a jsfiddle.
[10:30:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue then?
[10:30:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[10:30:21] <Milos> I just told you.
[10:30:24] <robertmaxrees> and what is "Boolean" ?
[10:30:29] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:30:47] <Milos> well, null and '' evaluate to false so it will only be matched if it's true.
[10:34:07] <Milos> I tried the javascript-equivalent (no jquery) with the same outcome
[10:37:56] <Milos> whoops, no, the javascript one is fine
[10:38:14] <Milos> probably something to do with the boolean bit, but I couldn't guess what
[10:41:31] <robertmaxrees> back
[10:51:26] <robertmaxrees> so $.map() takes a function as the second arg - you're passing in the Boolean constructor, which isn't what you want.
[11:04:43] <Utils> I'm looking to scroll horizontally to end of text, then back to start... and repeat... on mouseover only. Unsure on how to do this. Any pointers please?
[11:04:54] <robertmaxrees> you want to replicate a marquee.
[11:04:55] <robertmaxrees> i did this one.
[11:05:19] <robertmaxrees> let me look for the js i used.
[11:08:39] <Utils> marquee's I've seen don't quite do what I want... for example this one: http://jsfiddle.net/4mTMw/8/ it goes all the way off the page rather than just going back and forth when it reaches each endof the text.
[11:08:56] <robertmaxrees> oh you don't want to to continue?
[11:09:01] <robertmaxrees> you want it to "rewind"
[11:09:39] <Utils> yes, i want it to scroll to end, scroll to start, scroll to end ... and so on.

[11:27:42] <Utils> robertmaxrees: I overlooked that. I tried to utilize it on .topic-bar marquee, and well... http://jsfiddle.net/qu0L21j1/34/ it doesn't seem to reset properly all the time, and it is pretty fast for the topic in "Lobby".
[11:28:10] <Utils> Also ideally I'd like the topic in "Staff only" to not start as it is short. Hover over the topics to have them scroll.
[11:29:58] <jak2000> robertmaxrees any advice? i want select the text of a Select/option....
[11:30:57] <jonyshot> https://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/ using this can you make multiple tab content and have the main tabs open it
[11:31:30] <jonyshot> like have the demo 2 times and have them both switch tabs when you click through the tabs
[11:35:23] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you know what i'm going to tell you ;)
[11:36:06] <jak2000> yes
[11:36:10] <jak2000> 2ble spaces
[11:36:18] <Milos> robertmaxrees, I was never using $.map().

[12:05:28] <n00bdev> the document.change did the fix
[12:05:34] <n00bdev> is that ok?
[12:59:21] <claytonzaugg> how can I target <label for="toggle-switch1"> so I can alter it in CSS?
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> use an attribute selector.

[13:00:34] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend :D
[13:01:22] <claytonzaugg> Didn't know what to search for, I kept trying "CSS target element" or "css scope" and it kept coming up with :target and :scope.  It was Attribute that I didn't know I needed to search for
[13:01:38] <claytonzaugg> much thanks
[13:02:15] <claytonzaugg> so this? label[for='toggle-switch1']
[13:02:24] <robertmaxrees> Did You Try?â¢
[13:02:35] <hapi> (TM) :D
[13:02:50] <robertmaxrees> also - is this for a jquery selector or raw css?
[13:02:53] <claytonzaugg> I did, but it didn't work
[13:03:21] <claytonzaugg> I'd like to be able to do it for both, I need to select via this way for these particular elements
[13:03:28] <Username_> robertmaxrees: aren't they the same thing?
[13:03:42] <robertmaxrees> Username_ same syntax, but attribute selectors in jq are slowish
[13:03:49] <Username_> our epic $ is. :o
[13:04:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery also adds some extra, non-css extensions.
[13:04:34] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lkeb3L9f/
[13:04:35] <Username_> its like css++
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> works here.
[13:05:20] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[13:05:34] <robertmaxrees> Username_ that doesn't mean you should always default to selectors for everything.
[13:05:50] <robertmaxrees> they can be quite slow depending on what you're doing, and get very difficult to read very quickly.
[13:06:02] <claytonzaugg> what the freak... why is mine not working *thinking outloud*
[13:06:19] <robertmaxrees> check spelling.
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> what kind of styles you applying?
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:07:35] <claytonzaugg> applying margin to the right
[13:07:38] <claytonzaugg> simple
[13:08:37] <claytonzaugg> let me double check a few things
[13:10:02] <robertmaxrees> try applying something like a green border.
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> if that works, then the layout of the element doesn't allow margin-right.
[13:10:15] <robertmaxrees> or change the font size.
[13:11:30] <Username_> guys, i was using jquery ($ = document.querySelector) and apparently that doesn't work in firefox anymore, what happened?
[13:11:43] <claytonzaugg> hell, I found the problem. Something is overriding my dang CSS!
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> Username_ that's... not jquery.
[13:12:44] <Username_> claytonzaugg: nice malware..
[13:13:11] <robertmaxrees> Username_ thatdoesn't mean malware fwiw.
[13:13:16] <Kartagis> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on page prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'bindRemove'  <--- how can I fix this without removing jquery mobile?
[13:13:17] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg sounds like a plugin you're using.
[13:13:31] <claytonzaugg> Yeah, I think it's freaking jquery ui dangit
[13:13:36] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[13:13:46] <claytonzaugg> ui-mobile label is overriding it
[13:13:46] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis make sure you're loading things in the right order.
[13:14:09] <robertmaxrees> Username_ so clarify your problem.
[13:14:32] <Kartagis> you mean the javascripts?
[13:14:41] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis yes.
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you need to load things in the correct order.
[13:15:13] <robertmaxrees> also, make sure you're initing things before trying to use them.
[13:15:17] <claytonzaugg> Thanks robertmaxrees, resolved it this way: .ui-mobile label[for="toggle-switch1"]
[13:15:26] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg there you go.
[13:15:26] <Username_> robertmaxrees:why doesn't that work, or on a more serious note, why are so many problems with compiling jQuery with iojs, several plugins are obsolete.
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> Username_ wut
[13:15:38] <robertmaxrees> something isn't making sense here.
[13:15:53] <robertmaxrees> 1. $ = document.querySelector is not jquery.
[13:15:55] <claytonzaugg> iojs is getting envoloped into Node.js Username_
[13:16:17] <robertmaxrees> 2. jquery is much better suited for client-side - not sure why you're using it server-side.
[13:16:19] <robertmaxrees> 3. what plugins?
[13:16:43] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: you mean $(function() { ... }); ?
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that doesn't guarantee that scripts have loaded.  and that particular error is actually an issue with trying to use something before initializing it.
[13:17:57] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: there is no bindRemove in my code
[13:18:05] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis something is calling it then.
[13:18:08] <Username_> robertmaxrees, git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git && cd jquery && npm run build
[13:18:14] <Kartagis> it goes away when I drop jqm though
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis fixingthesejquery.com - check this out.
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> Username_ uh
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> Username_ back waaaay up.
[13:18:38] <robertmaxrees> you're bounxing around - what are you actually trying to do?
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> *bouncing
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you've got a dependency issue i'm guessing - trying to use things before they're ready.  without seeing the code, it's hard to be of much help.
[13:22:41] <Username_> Kartigas: you're not using on load, or you need AMD, or something along those lines
[13:22:49] <robertmaxrees> Username_ not necessarily ;)
[13:23:07] <robertmaxrees> that error happens when you run a widget method against something that hasn't been initialized yet.
[13:23:59] <Username_> setTimeout(8000, function() { /* YOUR CODE GOES HERE */ }); // just to make sure
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> and Username_ i just did a fresh pull of jquery master branch and did an npm build - worked fine.
[13:24:04] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> don't ever use timeouts for something like that.
[13:24:12] <Username_> ^ that should fix his error, right?
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> that's also not the issue here.
[13:24:20] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the problem.
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> the issue is they're running widget methods before initializing the widget.
[13:24:40] <Kartagis> 8 seconds?
[13:24:42] <Kartagis> heh
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[13:24:53] <Kartagis> I will not
[13:25:10] <Username_> maybe 9001 milliseconds would have been better
[13:25:16] <robertmaxrees> hurr hurr ;)
[13:25:37] <Kartagis> I dropped jqm once again. I can't afford to debug that right now
[13:25:44] <weaseal> hey all! I'm having trouble making multiple form elements update via jQuery, does anyone know what I need to do? I think some kind of for loop, but I am pretty new to this: https://jsfiddle.net/p2hhpgwb/4/
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis sounds like you're loading a modal and trying to run widget methods against it maybe?
[13:26:19] <robertmaxrees> weaksauce you want .each() - also, use .prop();
[13:26:37] <robertmaxrees> err, weaseal
[13:26:39] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: all I'm using jqm is for page slides
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis just pointing out what's causing the issue ;)
[13:27:00] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: thanks so much, I will google those
[13:27:09] <robertmaxrees> actually, you might not need each()
[13:27:14] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: yeah, that gave me an idea
[13:27:25] <Kartagis> I'll have to try later,
[13:30:50] <robertmaxrees> weaseal there's a much easier way to do this btw.
[13:31:40] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: pls
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> .val() can set the value of dropdowns.
[13:32:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p2hhpgwb/5/
[13:32:30] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: !!! awesome
[13:32:38] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: very elegant
[13:32:51] <robertmaxrees> not really elegant - just uses the API.
[13:33:14] <weaseal> haha took me 6 hours to write what I showed you, and you did it in half as many lines
[13:33:55] <robertmaxrees> :) have you hit up learn.jquery.com?
[13:35:11] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: no but I will check it out! Thank you
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> also: google is pretty helpful too.
[13:36:06] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: haha I am pretty familiar with google, but new to jquery today so a bit weak on the google-fu in this regard
[14:20:31] <jak2000> robertmaxrees? http://postimg.org/image/49u7a0iif/d0d55d58/   strange strange, why?
[14:20:43] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:21:48] <jak2000> arghh
[14:21:50] <jak2000> :)
[14:21:52] <jak2000> wait
[14:28:05] <robertmaxrees> that's taking a long time.
[14:28:23] <robertmaxrees> also, look at your screenshot, they're not equal because you have two spaces in one of those strings.
[14:28:44] <sillyslux> he already got the answer in ##javascript
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* i really wish people would stop doing that.
[14:29:32] <robertmaxrees> waste of everybody's time.
[14:30:40] <BeWilled> Trying to get basic authentication to work under jquery 1.10.2 using the ajax() method however the authorization header is not being set https://jsfiddle.net/wsy64ruh/
[14:32:13] <Primero> Hi
[14:32:38] <duckgoose> hello
[14:34:23] <Primero> how can i obtain the id from a tab, into a click event?
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:34:51] <robertmaxrees> like, you pressed tab and now you're focused on another element?
[14:35:09] <Primero> sorry, by my english, let me try of explain better
[14:35:16] <robertmaxrees> a fiddl would be best.
[14:35:18] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[14:35:43] <duckgoose> $( "div.tab" ).click(function() { alert( $(this).attr("id"); ); });
[14:35:49] <robertmaxrees> just this.id
[14:35:53] <robertmaxrees> no need for the jquery wrapper there.
[14:37:04] <Primero> thanks robertmaxress, i will test
[14:37:17] <robertmaxrees> also: use console.log()
[14:37:22] <robertmaxrees> alert() is gross for testin.
[14:37:26] <duckgoose> nit picking
[14:37:40] <robertmaxrees> people often don't know about these things.
[14:37:45] <robertmaxrees> and then nobody tells them.
[14:38:05] <robertmaxrees> then it's 6 months later and they get chided because nobody ever told them but people assume they should "just know"
[14:39:33] <Primero> I obtain the parent ID of the tab, I want the ID of the <li> of tab
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> is the LI a parent or a child?
[14:40:35] <Primero> activate: function(event, ui) { window.alert(this.id ); }
[14:40:41] <Primero> is a child
[14:40:53] <robertmaxrees> then $(this).find('li')
[14:41:02] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id') is useful here.
[14:41:25] <Primero> thanks I will test
[14:45:14] <weaseal> any suggestions on how I could change this: $('select').val(selectedValue); to only operate on specific CSS IDs?
[14:45:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:45:30] <robertmaxrees> select the IDs...
[14:45:39] <weaseal> like I don't want it to change *every* form field, just ones that have <id=this>
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> only one element can have a given ID fwiw.
[14:45:59] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead.
[14:46:02] <robertmaxrees> and select the class.
[14:46:03] <weaseal> ok, a class then :)
[14:46:08] <robertmaxrees> just like with CSS.
[14:46:33] <weaseal> I know how to write the html part, it's the jquery part that's failing
[14:46:49] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with targeting classes using css?
[14:47:09] <weaseal> irrespective of jquery, yes
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery's selectors are based on CSS>
[14:47:37] <robertmaxrees> in fact, jquery supports all CSS selectors, plus some added bonuses.
[14:47:44] <robertmaxrees> so you'd target them the same way you would with CSS>
[14:48:56] <weaseal> I get that in principal :)
[14:49:03] <weaseal> it's the practical application where I'm not clear
[14:49:04] <weaseal>    $('select').('.devprod').val(selectedValue);
[14:49:08] <weaseal> that's not it...
[14:49:13] <robertmaxrees> err..
[14:49:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.devprod')
[14:49:21] <robertmaxrees> that's the selector...
[14:49:35] <robertmaxrees> $() takes a few things, but most often it's used to take a string that's a selector
[14:49:43] <weaseal> hmm
[14:50:12] <robertmaxrees> it'll take any css selector you throw at it, too.  though sometimes you have to escape them, that's rare
[14:52:04] <robertmaxrees> $() is just a function that returns an object - it's a lot easier to think about it that way.
[14:52:33] <weaseal> gotcha
[14:52:37] <robertmaxrees> you'd never do someObject.()
[14:53:22] <robertmaxrees> that making sense?
[14:54:40] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: yeah, it does
[14:54:41] <weaseal> thanks
[14:55:17] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: here's where I'm stuck if you're curious https://jsfiddle.net/hrnr3jwk/1/
[14:55:31] <robertmaxrees> $('.devprod').('select').val(selectedValue); ?
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> what's with the ('select')?
[14:56:05] <weaseal> well compare with this one https://jsfiddle.net/hrnr3jwk/2/
[14:56:07] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to select?
[14:56:18] <weaseal> I just want to update all fields with class=devprod
[14:56:22] <weaseal> but not any others
[14:56:26] <robertmaxrees> then drop ('select')
[14:56:34] <robertmaxrees> $('.devprod').val(selectedValue);
[14:56:56] <weaseal> robertmaxrees: unfortunately that doesn't update any of them
[14:57:15] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:57:24] <robertmaxrees> you set .val() on select elements.
[14:57:30] <robertmaxrees> devprod is on options.
[14:57:32] <robertmaxrees> put it on the parent select.
[14:58:22] <weaseal> ok thanks I'll read up on that
[14:58:30] <robertmaxrees> nothing to read up on...
[14:58:57] <weaseal> it is if you don't know what "parent select" is :)
[14:59:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:59:06] <robertmaxrees> the select element.
[14:59:13] <robertmaxrees> you have that class on the option elements.
[14:59:19] <robertmaxrees> you want it on the select element instead.
[14:59:26] <weaseal> oh!
[15:00:42] <weaseal> woot I get it now robertmaxrees
[15:00:44] <weaseal> thanks again!
[15:00:51] <robertmaxrees> sure.  check out learn.jquery.com
[15:00:55] <robertmaxrees> it'll explain all of these.
[15:00:55] <weaseal> you've made my day significantly less frustrating
[16:08:28] <VectorX> hi on this page, if you hover over the Solutions menu item in chrome you see the second level but on Firefox you have to click, anyone see why hover isnt working on FF http://www.infinaconnect.com/ somehow on hover the class to open doesnt seem to get added on FF
[16:10:32] <robertmaxrees> working for me in ff.
[16:11:16] <VectorX> im on 40.0.3, i just cant figure out whats going on
[16:11:25] <robertmaxrees> cache maybe?
[16:11:30] <VectorX> cleared
[16:11:43] <robertmaxrees> working for me.
[16:11:46] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[16:11:51] <robertmaxrees> share the code maybe?
[16:13:48] <VectorX> robertmaxrees its a wordpress site, so theme, plugins etc, the menu is https://wordpress.org/plugins/megamenu/
[16:13:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[16:14:11] <robertmaxrees> if it's a plugin not working, report it.
[16:15:01] <VectorX> yeah i wanted to check if it was something obvious first
[16:16:06] <VectorX> prob is guy who owns the site said its not showing up for him in FF and IE10, i dont have ie10 and i can see its not workong on FF, but working for me on other browsers, chorme, ie11, safari
[16:16:16] <robertmaxrees> you can get IE10
[16:16:27] <VectorX> right there is that vm
[16:16:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:16:59] <robertmaxrees> but it looks like it's working fine soooo.
[16:17:01] <VectorX> i got it at work, so maybe ill test on that tomorrow, but was trying to see whats up with FF
[16:17:06] <VectorX> yeah thanks for testing
[16:22:46] <VectorX> robertmaxrees i ran !!('ontouchstart' in window); in the FF console and got true, on chorme its false
[16:22:53] <VectorX> why would that be
[16:23:00] <VectorX> is there some setting in FF that would do that
[16:23:09] <VectorX> i dont even have the dev tools enabled
[16:23:33] <VectorX> well beside when i ran that command
[16:23:34] <VectorX> lol
[16:25:00] <robertmaxrees> check dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled in your config.
[16:25:13] <robertmaxrees> should be 0.
[16:25:42] <VectorX> its 1
[16:25:49] <robertmaxrees> so then something changed it.
[16:25:59] <robertmaxrees> change it to 0 - problem is on your machine.
[16:26:32] <VectorX> now its working
[16:26:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:26:50] <robertmaxrees> for whatever reason your copy of FF changed into thinking it was touch enabled.
[16:27:04] <VectorX> fkn copy of firefox
[16:27:09] <VectorX> wasting my time
[16:27:13] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:27:18] <robertmaxrees> lol okay.
[16:27:48] <VectorX> at the rate these apps get cloned, you never know if you got the real thing
[16:27:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:28:03] <robertmaxrees> did you install from mozilla's site?
[16:28:16] <VectorX> yeah i got my copy from the mozilla site
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> then you're golden.
[16:28:31] <VectorX> how about ie
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[16:28:43] <VectorX> what would i check on that, im guessing its the same issue
[16:28:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> IE reports that it supports touch even on non-touch devices.
[16:30:13] <VectorX> is there some way to detect this, like when dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled is 1 to get some sort of true value
[16:30:23] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:30:26] <robertmaxrees> in firefox?
[16:30:28] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[16:30:29] <VectorX> yeah
[16:30:38] <robertmaxrees> not without a custom build of FF.
[16:30:43] <robertmaxrees> it's a freak one-off occurrance.
[16:30:43] <VectorX> ic
[16:31:09] <VectorX> well happend to the guy complaining and me, so strange coincidence
[16:31:23] <robertmaxrees> are you the guy maintaining the plugin?
[16:31:30] <VectorX> no
[16:31:31] <robertmaxrees> and there are other reports about that value from a while back.
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to report this to the plugin author.
[16:31:56] <VectorX> i will do that
[17:03:09] <BostonGeorge2k> hi i have 6 boxes each box include a button, on button click i add a class to the box where the button is triggered
[17:03:37] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[17:03:40] <BostonGeorge2k> however, when for example box 5 is triggered i want all added classes on other boxes be removed
[17:03:56] <robertmaxrees> easy.,
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> what's the class?
[17:04:03] <BostonGeorge2k>             $('.col-md-4').removeClass('service-bg');
[17:04:04] <BostonGeorge2k>             $(e.target).parents('.col-md-4').toggleClass('service-bg')
[17:04:09] <BostonGeorge2k> this is my code for that
[17:04:18] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste multiple lines into the channel;.
[17:04:21] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle instead.
[17:04:38] <BostonGeorge2k> it works so far but if i toggle the same box twice the class doesnt get removed
[17:04:40] <BostonGeorge2k> sorry robert
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't toggle things.
[17:05:21] <BostonGeorge2k> :/
[17:05:26] <Synthead> if I have two jquery ui DOMs serving as dialogs, a and b, can I do something like $(a, b).dialog("close") ?  if so, what would the syntax look like?
[17:05:34] <robertmaxrees> wut?
[17:05:37] <robertmaxrees> "DOMs"?
[17:05:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean like fragments?
[17:06:03] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: like $("#foo")
[17:06:09] <robertmaxrees> so an object.
[17:06:16] <robertmaxrees> (that's not "A DOM" fwiw.
[17:06:34] <Synthead> ah, right on
[17:07:01] <Synthead> I can use its selectors, like $("#a,#b).dialog("close"), but I'd rather interact with a and b directly somehow
[17:07:02] <BostonGeorge2k> awesome channel :D
[17:07:14] <robertmaxrees> BostonGeorge2k http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/
[17:07:17] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[17:07:27] <robertmaxrees> Synthead then do each directly?
[17:07:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're looking for instead.
[17:08:19] <BostonGeorge2k> i guess its not
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> BostonGeorge2k is that the functionality you want?
[17:08:46] <BostonGeorge2k> click on the same link twice
[17:08:54] <robertmaxrees> you want it to remove?
[17:08:56] <BostonGeorge2k> active should the get removed too, like toggled
[17:08:57] <BostonGeorge2k> yes
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> thgen use a conditional.
[17:09:10] <robertmaxrees> test if it already has that class.
[17:09:27] <BostonGeorge2k> ok
[17:09:57] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/k61udaLL/2/
[17:11:00] <robertmaxrees> BostonGeorge2k http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/3/
[17:11:16] <robertmaxrees> oh, that - you want .add()
[17:11:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/4/
[17:12:27] <BostonGeorge2k> well the class from box 4 should be removed as well if box 5 gets clicked
[17:12:48] <robertmaxrees> BostonGeorge2k that's what that last fiddle does.
[17:12:52] <BostonGeorge2k> ooh ok
[17:13:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/3/ this one, i mean.
[17:13:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure why Synthead edited your fiddle for theirs lol
[17:13:56] <robertmaxrees> Synthead or this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/6/
[17:14:09] <Synthead> hahahaha
[17:14:26] <Synthead> I'll admit that's kinda trolly
[17:14:32] <robertmaxrees> i ;)
[17:14:35] <BostonGeorge2k> its not working for me :/
[17:14:39] <BostonGeorge2k> which fiddle is the final?
[17:14:44] <Synthead> I thought it was for me at first xD
[17:14:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/3/
[17:14:55] <robertmaxrees> BostonGeorge2k http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k61udaLL/3/ this one does what you want.
[17:15:02] <BostonGeorge2k> ok thanks!
[17:17:32] <BostonGeorge2k> hm i cant adapt it
[17:17:40] <robertmaxrees> then share your code :)
[17:17:49] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic concept.
[17:18:35] <BostonGeorge2k> hte button is inside a div called .col-md-4 and i need to add / remove to this one. my guess was var $this = $(e.target).parents('.col-md-4');
[17:18:44] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[17:18:50] <robertmaxrees> and don't use $this
[17:18:54] <robertmaxrees> but update the fiddle.
[17:18:59] <robertmaxrees> because i can't see your html in my mind.
[17:30:09] <BostonGeorge2k> removing from others is yet still not working but iam getting closer
[17:30:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:30:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:30:25] <robertmaxrees> you could just give us your code and we could help you.
[17:31:12] <BostonGeorge2k> i think it works now!! thanks for the code
[17:31:16] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[17:31:20] <robertmaxrees> understand how it works?
[17:32:12] <BostonGeorge2k> yes i think although i am not always sure which one is picked since there is not iteration over all elements or so
[17:32:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:33:09] <BostonGeorge2k> there is no looping like for each element add / remove class , javascript works somehow different :D
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> it's not javascript.
[17:33:17] <robertmaxrees> it's jquery.
[17:33:23] <BostonGeorge2k> yes jquery^
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> there's a method called .each(), but in this case you don't need to enumerate over anything.
[17:34:01] <robertmaxrees> $('.active') is just selecting the class you're conditionally adding.
[17:34:26] <robertmaxrees> normally you only have one, but .addClass() is kind of cool.
[17:34:29] <BostonGeorge2k> what exactly does $this represent in your fiddle
[17:34:37] <robertmaxrees> the element that was clicked.
[17:34:54] <BostonGeorge2k> ok perfect
[17:34:57] <robertmaxrees> same as e.currentTarget
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/addclass/
[17:35:15] <BostonGeorge2k> ahh then you remove the class from all elements except the ones clicked
[17:35:17] <BostonGeorge2k> got it
[17:35:27] <robertmaxrees> notice how this says "Adds the specified class(es) to each element in the set of matched elements."?  that means it'll add the class to all elements selected, not just the first one.
[17:35:32] <robertmaxrees> "the each is implied", basically.
[17:35:36] <robertmaxrees> removeClass works the same way.
[17:36:15] <BostonGeorge2k> that's cool :) and you put a condition on it saying "if not the one that is clicked" using .not($this)
[17:36:25] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:36:53] <BostonGeorge2k> never saw that before in any programming or scripting language
[17:37:05] <robertmaxrees> you're not seeing it in either.
[17:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you're seeing it in a library
[17:37:26] <BostonGeorge2k> yes ok :D
[17:39:52] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[17:39:57] <robertmaxrees> if you ever want some good info.
[17:40:25] <BostonGeorge2k> would you repalce slideToggle as well?
[17:40:32] <BostonGeorge2k> with a conditonal statement
[17:40:33] <robertmaxrees> i avoid all toggles.
[17:40:42] <robertmaxrees> because you run into the situation you had earlier.
[17:41:05] <BostonGeorge2k> i am wondering what the if would be since i dont want to add a class, if (slide_down) { slideUp() }
[17:42:36] <BostonGeorge2k> oh i could is :visible i guess
[17:42:41] <BostonGeorge2k> i'll give it a try
[17:44:19] <BostonGeorge2k> yap, cool
[20:57:05] <NitroLiq> Anyone awake?
[21:08:13] <jonez> NitroLiq, ya
[21:09:05] <NitroLiq> Any chance I get some help as to what I'm doing wrong with a simple bit of code? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rOedGy
[21:09:45] <NitroLiq> Just trying to apply styles to a list based on number of <li>
[21:10:23] <NitroLiq> I'm guessing something's up with my selectors
[21:10:44] <NitroLiq> specifically, the f-dropdown class
