[00:03:31] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah.
[00:40:25] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: do you have any recommendations based on what I am looking for?
[00:41:12] <robertmaxrees> not really.  sorry duder.
[00:42:27] <Forbidd3n> ok, thanks
[06:10:00] <MACscr> hmm, im not 100% sure how to use toggle with a click event and wrap/unwrap. before toggle used ot have the click event built into it, but now it seems to you have to do that first.  I know this code is wrong, but maybe it gives you an idea on what im trying to do? https://jsfiddle.net/cwfp34oe/

[09:09:26] <RobinL> Hi all, do anyone know if there is any slowness on code.jquery.com today? getting very very slow loading time with the message waiting for code.jquery.com today, and i'm not alone, several user in the company from all over the world has the issue atm
[11:22:27] <reynierpm> hi there, what I am doing wrong here to find the th and change the text? https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/wm51refx/2/
[11:29:24] <Woet> reynierpm: did you see the console?
[11:29:34] <Woet> also, inline JS is dirty. just bind on the classes using JS.
[11:31:24] <reynierpm> Woet, I fixed it as in https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/wm51refx/7/ not sure if it's the best way
[11:31:29] <reynierpm> *tough
[11:33:10] <aruns> Hi, can a recursive function which wraps calls to .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() in a setTimeout cause significant memory leak?
[11:34:45] <aruns> https://bpaste.net/show/d7e9ff112927
[11:34:50] <aruns> This is my example.
[11:36:03] <shoky> aruns: no that's fine
[11:42:01] <aruns> Thanks shoky
[11:42:06] <aruns> Seems to be something else then.
[12:24:13] <Forbidd3n> If I have var item = $('.item'); or other items, sometimes I item will hold .selector which would be .item, but sometimes it is undefined
[12:26:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:29:10] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: looking at line 20 of this - the .selector has .drag - https://jsfiddle.net/blupointmedia/x8oy0vp7/17/
[12:29:34] <robertmaxrees> are you asking a question?  can't figure out what you need heh.
[12:29:53] <Forbidd3n> yeah my question is where is .selector coming from?
[12:30:41] <robertmaxrees> DD.draggables.selector ?
[12:31:15] <robertmaxrees> just follow the object creation.
[12:31:36] <robertmaxrees> earlier there's a DD.draggables = $(o.draggables);
[12:31:40] <Forbidd3n> yes, line 100 it is setting the draggables class, line 11 it set DD.draggables, but DD.draggables has .selector
[12:31:57] <robertmaxrees> so what does that suggest to you?
[12:31:59] <Forbidd3n> correct so that would make it $($('.drag)), correct?
[12:32:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:32:43] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/selector/
[12:35:40] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[12:36:36] <Forbidd3n> yeah it is deprecated in my version os jQuery which is why it is undefined
[12:36:37] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[12:36:42] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:36:52] <robertmaxrees> ah.  becuase you're using version 3.  got it.
[12:36:55] <Forbidd3n> yep
[14:37:54] <paule32> hello
[14:38:24] <paule32> i have problem with layout widget: https://www.kallup.solutions/test1/test.html
[14:38:58] <paule32> i would like to use the "south" as second layout only for the "west", and "middle", no "east"
[14:39:05] <paule32> how can i do this?
[15:15:00] <gambl0r3> hello?
[15:39:08] <robertmaxrees> paule32 link to a fiddle instead.
[15:47:25] <paule32> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/c8mep47t/3/
[15:48:03] <robertmaxrees>  $(...).layout is not a function
[15:48:05] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:48:08] <robertmaxrees> missing a plugin maybe?
[15:50:48] <paule32> only ui
[15:50:50] <paule32> jquery
[15:53:17] <robertmaxrees> .layout() isn't apart of jquery ui.
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> so something isn't right here.
[16:02:46] <paule32> http://layout.jquery-dev.com/documentation.cfm#Depends_on
[16:06:01] <paule32> http://layout.jquery-dev.com/documentation.cfm#Depends_on
[16:07:27] <robertmaxrees> "jQuery UI Layout Plug-in"
[16:07:37] <robertmaxrees> it's an extra plugion - not apart of jquery UI base.
