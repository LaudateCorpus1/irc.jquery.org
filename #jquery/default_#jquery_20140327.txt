[00:19:21] <mepl> can anyone tell if this is a request sent by the client or the server? https://github.com/timheap/jquery-xmlrpc since it's jQuery it must be the client?
[00:19:42] <mepl> am trying to figure out from what IP the request will be sent from.

[00:20:12] <anli_> I am trying to read a style with .css, the div has gotten it by having a certain id declared in the css file, however, I only read an empty string, the style is margin
[00:20:14] <Voyage_> any help?
[00:20:17] <anli_> Why is it empty?
[00:22:56] <aro_> has anyone used nestable

[00:25:54] <aro> when using draggable to move a node, is there a way to calculate the offset of places it moved?
[00:28:14] <anli_> Is there a way to read the margin property using .css()?
[00:28:25] <anli_> .css('margin') was insufficient
[00:28:39] <aro> why?
[00:29:12] <anli_> Getting empty string if your question was to me
[00:29:13] <anli_> :)
[00:29:21] <aro> an empty string?
[00:29:26] <anli_> ""
[00:29:39] <anli_> There is nothing between the ":s ;)
[00:29:51] <anli_> Not that it is "nothing"
[00:30:24] <anli_> Ah, must use something else than margin, for instance margin-left
[00:30:33] <anli_> Even if that is not used in the css file
[00:32:14] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/TZRGu/
[00:42:17] <aro> anli_: did you see that
[00:43:27] <anli_> aro: oh, checking
[00:43:36] <anli_> Interesting
[00:44:08] <anli_> No output, I had to change the style to margin-left (for instance)
[00:44:11] <anli_> Using ff
[00:50:27] <anli_> aro: you getting some output yourself?
[01:17:07] <dawkirst> What do you guys think of this answer? http://stackoverflow.com/a/22656937/803143
[01:19:11] <aro> its decent
[01:19:25] <aro> has anyone used nestable
[02:12:44] <aro> has anyone used nestable
[02:19:09] <coRz> any questions?
[02:20:32] <pessimis_> $(".foo").eq(0) is the same as $(".foo").filter(function(i) { return i ===0; }), right?
[02:20:43] <pessimis_> *=== 0
[02:21:38] <Cork> pessimis_: not really no
[02:21:47] <pessimis_> :(
[02:21:56] <Cork> more like $(".foo").eq(0) is the same as $($(".foo")[0])
[02:22:09] <Cork> there is no looping involved
[02:22:28] <pessimis_> Cork so if I want to select the equivalent of :nth-child(3n), what would that selection look like?
[02:22:47] <Cork> pessimis_: exactly that
[02:23:19] <Cork> pessimis_: :nth-child(3n) isn't the same as the third element in the result
[02:23:35] <pessimis_> ah
[02:23:44] <pessimis_> I want it for the third element in the result
[02:23:51] <Cork> eq(3)
[02:23:54] <Cork> opps
[02:23:56] <Cork> eq(2)
[02:24:05] <coRz> $(".foo").eq(0) = jquery element $(".foo")[0] = dom element
[02:24:13] <coRz> know the diffrence
[02:24:30] <Cork> coRz: no it isn't jquery element
[02:24:45] <Cork> it is a jquery array like object with dom elements
[02:24:50] <coRz> $(".foo").eq(0) = jquery object
[02:24:55] <Cork> yes
[02:25:29] <Cork> coRz: if you was talking about my code line there is a wrapper there
[02:25:49] <Cork> as $(".foo").eq(0) is identical to $($(".foo")[0])
[02:26:01] <Cork> except that it is messier
[02:26:28] <coRz> yeah Cork but the $($(".foo")[0]) is overhead...
[02:26:29] <Cork> well and eq() sets prevObject
[02:26:38] <Cork> coRz: so is .eq()
[02:26:41] <coRz> nope
[02:26:57] <Cork> and actually .eq has more memory overhead
[02:27:25] <coRz> i read its other way around
[02:27:33] <coRz> the*
[02:27:50] <Cork> coRz: each time you make a reduction in the selection a new object is created
[02:28:05] <Cork> that includes .filter, .eq, .not, .find and so on
[02:28:20] <coRz> agree
[02:28:21] <Cork> all of them set the old object to this.prevObject
[02:28:35] <Cork> so you actually carry around the new AND the old object
[02:28:58] <Cork> $($(".foo")[0]) just grabs the specific dom element and wraps it in jquery object
[02:28:58] <pessimis_> .eq(2) gets the third jQuery element. Which command fetches every three jQuery elements?
[02:29:12] <Cork> so it does the same amount of work
[02:29:18] <Cork> but without the reference to the old object
[02:29:22] <Cork> so the overhead is smaller
[02:29:38] <Cork> pessimis_: there isn't one
[02:30:08] <Cork> pessimis_: you would have to loop the array for that
[02:30:35] <coRz> Cork, $($(".foo")[0]) == $(".foo").eq(0) theres no point in wrapping it
[02:30:52] <Cork> coRz: uh, what?
[02:31:04] <coRz>  $($(".foo")[0])  is wrapped twice
[02:31:08] <Cork> no
[02:31:19] <Cork> $(".foo")[0] is the pure dom element
[02:31:51] <coRz> yea and wrapped in $() to get jquery object
[02:34:03] <Cork> coRz: yes, so no double wrapping
[02:34:28] <coRz> ג
[02:34:36] <coRz> Cork, kk
[02:34:52] <coRz> Cork, that was a long pointless arguement lol ;)
[02:35:01] <Cork> kinda ya
[02:35:32] <pessimis_> but using .filter to iterate over the array of elements wouldn't work, because it uses the DOM, instead of jQuery result?
[02:35:54] <Cork> pessimis_: it uses the result array
[02:36:07] <Cork> or what do you mean by jquery result?
[02:36:21] <pessimis_> the one I have left after performing a .hide() on some elements
[02:36:37] <Cork> huh?

[03:29:45] <DarsVaeda> I set selected to true which works but the display does not change, how do I do that?
[03:32:01] <DarsVaeda> ahh I used attr instead of prop

We're adding some validation methods in the additionnal-methods.js file, and fact is when we call them, we have (times to times) this error in js console : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined. Don't know why. Is there something to do to avoid that ?
[03:58:00] <aro> seutje: yes. I know the link
[03:58:04] <aro> I need help using it
[04:01:00] <coRz> nicolas_FR, in the rules you are using messages?
[04:01:21] <nicolas_FR> yes

[04:01:59] <coRz> yeah show me jsfiddle that block
[04:02:56] <Diplomat> hey guys! I have a little problem. I'd need to detect a click on ANY of the elements INSIDE the div (div can have multiple divs or whatever inside it)
[04:02:58] <Diplomat> Any ideas?
[04:04:12] <coRz> Diplomat, $("thediv *").click(....) ??
[04:04:14] <seutje> aro: sry, I just wasn't familiar with it and got curious
[04:04:25] <Diplomat> I tried, it didn't work
[04:04:32] <Diplomat> somehow
[04:05:01] <Cork> uh
[04:05:02] <Cork> no
[04:05:09] <Cork> you just want to bind a click handler on the div
[04:05:23] <Cork> event.target will be the element inside that was clicked
[04:06:11] <Cork> Diplomat: ^
[04:06:16] <SprkDev> I've recently updated my wordpress to 3.8 and now it seems slowers and the dashboard is crashing sometimes. What to do?
[04:07:34] <Cork> SprkDev: you should prob ask that in a wp channel
[04:08:06] <coRz> Diplomat, http://jsfiddle.net/2dLQz/
[04:08:28] <Cork> coRz: you really don't want to do that
[04:08:47] <Cork> it is extremely inefficient
[04:08:50] <coRz> why not?
[04:08:59] <coRz> he needs every click
[04:09:39] <Diplomat> weird, it doesnt work for me
[04:09:47] <Cork> coRz: http://jsfiddle.net/2dLQz/1/
[04:10:06] <Cork> cause that one does the same thing, but with one event handler instead of unknown amount
[04:10:33] <Cork> Diplomat: there might be event handlers bound that stops the event from bubbling
[04:10:38] <Cork> or something like that
[04:10:45] <coRz> well in that case you are right but depends on what he wants to happen when clicking
[04:10:56] <Cork> coRz: no
[04:11:04] <Cork> you never want to bind events on *
[04:11:07] <Cork> ever
[04:11:29] <Cork> its a splendid way to make sure your page will be slow
[04:11:35] <Diplomat> lol
[04:11:41] <Diplomat> speed is not a problem right now
[04:11:53] <Cork> Diplomat: do you have a demo of what your trying to do?
[04:12:05] <Diplomat> not really
[04:12:28] <Cork> cause your problems are most likely caused by either the parent being dynamically added
[04:12:37] <Cork> or some other code killing the event
[04:12:40] <Diplomat> maybe i could listen to document's clicks.. and just check if that event happened inside that div
[04:12:54] <Cork> Diplomat: you can use delegated event handler
[04:13:16] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'div > *', func)
[04:13:27] <Cork> and then this would be the clicked child
[04:13:38] <Diplomat> :O
[04:13:41] <Diplomat> trying now
[04:13:43] <JqueryHelp> hi all
[04:14:00] <Cork> Diplomat: you want to replace the "div" part though
[04:14:10] <Cork> with something much more specific

[04:17:29] <JqueryHelp> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/
[04:17:35] <Cork> JqueryHelp: php runs server side
[04:17:45] <JqueryHelp> i total lost on this
[04:18:06] <JqueryHelp> yes Cork
[04:18:10] <Cork> the question doesn't even really make sense...
[04:18:28] <JqueryHelp> i'm use google translate Cork  excuse me
[04:19:59] <JqueryHelp> I wish that when I call my ajax page with a $. ajax he returns to my php instead of delete Cork
[04:20:42] <Diplomat> http://jsfiddle.net/x6Lk9/
[04:20:47] <Diplomat> there im failing too lol
[04:21:15] <Diplomat> but yeah i need something like that
[04:22:10] <Cork> Diplomat: delegate use the reverse argument order from on
[04:22:41] <Cork> Diplomat: http://jsfiddle.net/x6Lk9/1/
[04:22:49] <coRz> Diplomat, use 'on'
[04:22:58] <Cork> also don't put element tag names infront of id's
[04:23:02] <Cork> *ids
[04:24:02] <Diplomat> woohoo :D
[04:24:03] <Diplomat> it works :D
[04:24:06] <Diplomat> thank you man
[04:44:49] <Diplomat> ok but guys how do i disable contextual menu for that element ?
[04:45:11] <Diplomat> i tried oncontextmenu return false, but it still shows it
[04:46:14] <Cork> Diplomat: if the browser allows it return false; or event.preventDefault() is how you do it
[04:47:14] <Diplomat> http://puu.sh/7LmCE.png i tried that way
[04:47:22] <Diplomat> and i added it to the main container
[04:47:39] <Cork> try event.preventDefault()
[04:49:20] <Diplomat> nope :/
[04:49:34] <Diplomat> but i know it works, but not the way i want
[04:49:46] <coRz> diplomat, http://jsfiddle.net/YM2z7/1/
[04:50:17] <Diplomat> yes that way it works
[04:50:22] <Diplomat> but i need it inside that div again
[04:50:28] <Diplomat> like click detection
[04:50:57] <Diplomat> http://puu.sh/7LmL9.png
[04:51:10] <coRz> http://jsfiddle.net/YM2z7/2/
[04:51:10] <coRz> ?
[04:51:11] <seutje> on oncontextmenu?
[04:51:18] <Cork> Diplomat: http://jsfiddle.net/x6Lk9/2/
[04:51:26] <coRz> Diplomat, http://jsfiddle.net/YM2z7/2/
[04:51:33] <Cork> slight modification of your old demo
[04:52:55] <Diplomat> :/
[04:52:56] <Diplomat> still
[04:53:07] <Cork> doesn't that page work for you?
[04:53:16] <donmatthew> hi all
[04:53:36] <Diplomat> http://puu.sh/7LmQm.png
[04:53:44] <donmatthew> when I'm using jquery UI:s slide effect my divs border jumps around a little.. someone recognize this issue??
[04:54:05] <Cork> Diplomat: please don't use images of your code
[04:54:24] <Cork> Diplomat: looks like you replace the context menu with your own
[04:54:45] <Diplomat> yes
[04:54:47] <Cork> Diplomat: and if that is the one your trying to prevent, you can't do it simply from the evnet
[04:55:43] <donmatthew> it rather looks like the height of the divs isn't correct
[04:56:32] <Diplomat> but you just did that in jsfiddle
[04:56:40] <Fenhl> hello. I made a new element using $('<img>', {...}), now how do I insert this into the DOM? $('#container').html doesn't seem to work
[04:56:57] <Cork> donmatthew: ya, those effect animations modify the dom quite heavy and it can cause quite noticeable rendering jumps
[04:57:11] <Cork> Diplomat: for the default one yes
[04:57:29] <Cork> Diplomat: but not if it is replaced by the db.contenxtMenu thing
[04:57:47] <Cork> Fenhl: it should
[04:57:51] <Fenhl> weird.
[04:57:58] <Cork> Fenhl: it will replace everything in the container though
[04:58:01] <Fenhl> sure
[04:58:21] <Cork> make sure $('#container') actually exists
[04:58:27] <Cork> console.log($('#container').length)
[04:59:06] <Fenhl> 0
[04:59:14] <donmatthew> Cork: :\ no way to get around?
[04:59:34] <Cork> donmatthew: you add extra elements around the content and animate though
[04:59:57] <Fenhl> anyway, this came up while I was trying to solve another problem, maybe if I get that to work I won't need that
[04:59:58] <donmatthew> Cork: thnx!
[05:00:03] <donmatthew> good idea, ill try
[05:00:16] <Cork> and making sure the element shields ex. margins and so on
[05:02:45] <Fenhl> I'm trying to add a method to our Person class that takes a size and returns an img element (html text or jquery object, doesn't really matter), which tries to load a series of images in order, using the next one if the current image fails to load
[05:04:00] <Cork> Fenhl: just create an element bind the onerror element and push it onto the dom
[05:04:01] <alexcf> hi there...
[05:04:11] <Cork> the event should then fire if you need to try the next one
[05:04:25] <Diplomat> woohoo  i made it
[05:04:27] <Diplomat> i used bind
[05:04:31] <Diplomat> instead of on
[05:04:37] <Cork> uh
[05:04:42] <Cork> your on pre 1.9?
[05:04:46] <Fenhl> Cork: it doesn't, here's what I have so far http://jsfiddle.net/beLTq/
[05:05:25] <Cork> Fenhl: ugg that isn't even close to what i meant
[05:05:36] <alexcf> im having some extremely frustrating issues with arkadmin which uses jquery...
[05:05:51] <alexcf> https://portal.protectglobal.net/scripts/js/ark2.min.js
[05:05:52] <Cork> Fenhl: don't use event attributes
[05:06:01] <alexcf> right at the bottom, it's got a load of variables
[05:06:17] <alexcf> what's the best way of generating these within my php site? or setting the variable elsewhere?
[05:06:39] <Fenhl> Cork: is this what you meant? http://api.jquery.com/error/
[05:10:50] <Cork> Fenhl: http://jsfiddle.net/beLTq/2/
[05:11:09] <Cork> you might want to replace the if case with a return :)
[05:11:13] <mrterryh> Hey guys, if I have a var containing "<page header etc> <body><section>content</section></body>" - how would I get the content between the section?
[05:11:17] <Cork> so it doesn't loop for ever if all images is broken
[05:11:55] <svector> anyone using jstree
[05:11:56] <svector> ?
[05:11:58] <Cork> $(v).text()
[05:12:02] <Cork> mrterryh: ^
[05:12:18] <mrterryh> But it's in a variable, so I can't use a selector
[05:12:36] <Cork> $() will trigger a parsing of it
[05:12:47] <Cork> you can't modify the string that way
[05:12:51] <Cork> but you can grab from it
[05:13:17] <Fenhl> Cork: try switching the second and third image URL in your example, it won't work
[05:13:52] <Cork> Fenhl: works fine here
[05:14:04] <Cork> i get http://wurstmineberg.de/assets/img/head/64/fenhl.png

[05:15:40] <dwarder> i have a list of object, and they have indexes, and they go like this  1 2 45 46 47 48    , how do i sort the keys that way so that they go like this 45 46 47 48 1 2 ?
[05:15:49] <Cork> mrterryh: yes it was the only thing in your example
[05:16:00] <Cork> mrterryh: $(data).filter('section') should work
[05:16:15] <Cork> mrterryh: but note getting full html is something you should try to avoide
[05:16:25] <Fenhl> Cork: nope, I get http://example.com/doesnotexisteither.jpg on both of these
[05:16:37] <mrterryh> Cork: Yeah, I think I'm going to use PHP to do this instead
[05:16:38] <Cork> mrterryh: cause fragments doesn't support holding things from outside body
[05:16:40] <mrterryh> Thanks for your help anyway :)
[05:17:04] <Fenhl> Cork: Chrome 33.0.1750.152 on OS X
[05:17:28] <Cork> Fenhl: interesting
[05:17:39] <Fenhl> huh. it works in Safari
[05:17:45] <Cork> Fenhl: looks like chrome only let you query two urls with one image tag
[05:18:14] <Cork> Fenhl: so you will have to replace the img element on error to get chrome to be happy
[05:18:21] <svector> how do I know which context menu item is clicked on the call back function?
[05:18:22] <Fenhl> I'll try that

[05:33:26] <Rhaoul> I hope I'm righ there with a question for JQuery mobile: Is there a widget to create an iOS alike slide-to-left to delete a list-item? (on iOS slide-to-left shows a red "delete" optin for list items)
[05:35:56] <Rhaoul> nevermind - i searched for "slide" but the correct search term would be "swipe"
[05:37:36] <Rhaoul> but not the right style anyay ;)
[05:38:26] <dwarder> how do i modify index of an abject?
[05:38:58] <Cork> dwarder: objects don't have index
[05:39:44] <dwarder> Cork: key?
[05:39:59] <dwarder> Cork: how do i modify keys?
[05:40:05] <Cork> dwarder: if you want to reorder the keys in an object you need to create a new object
[05:40:16] <Cork> and set the key/value combination in the order you want them
[05:40:22] <dwarder> in the chrome debug console i see   1:object  2:object 64:object
[05:40:36] <Cork> dwarder: normally your better of using an array of objects if you want that sort of behaviour

[05:48:33] <Fenhl> ^^
[05:49:11] <Cork> i guess it is to prevent ddos attacks on sites
[05:49:48] <JqueryHelp> every time I call my ajax page it returns to me my mysql data
[05:51:32] <joephilly> $('#Files ul').append($('<li><span>Test</span></li>')) <--- is jquery removing the span? Its not ending up in the DOM for some reason. I've Shift+F5 and Ctrl+F5 refreshed a dozen times ... driving me nuts
[05:52:36] <Fenhl> Cork: now the question is, how do I add srcset support? D:
[05:53:29] <JqueryHelp> joephilly: no it's empty()
[05:53:47] <joephilly> JqueryHelp, what do you mean by that?
[05:54:03] <joephilly> the word "Test" is still there but no span
[05:55:14] <joephilly> it's literally removing the span (or else chrome removes it)
[05:55:38] <joephilly> and its also putting the text on a different line than anything I put after it
[05:56:10] <Cork> Fenhl: srcset support?
[05:56:52] <Cork> joephilly: no it doesn't
[05:56:59] <Fenhl> Cork: a similar image stack but with twice the resolution, for HiDPI screens
[05:57:03] <Cork> joephilly: also you don't need the $() around if you use append
[05:57:25] <Cork> Fenhl: don't follow
[05:57:36] <Cork> i don't see how the code depends on what the image is
[05:57:39] <Fenhl> Cork: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/srcset/w3c-srcset/
[05:57:53] <Cork> oh
[05:58:00] <Cork> that's a new one
[05:58:35] <JqueryHelp> ok Cork but i use $() with append
[05:58:38] <Cork> Fenhl: i've never used it so not sure
[05:59:16] <Cork> JqueryHelp: i haven't been able to understand your question sorry
[06:00:21] <Cork> Fenhl: if you replace attr('src') with prop('src') it should just work
[06:00:32] <joephilly> stupid question... how do I refresh my javascript files in Chrome?
[06:00:32] <Cork> Fenhl: at least according to the spec
[06:00:44] <Cork> f5?
[06:01:37] <joephilly> Cork, obviously but its not working... shift+ft and ctrl+f5 dont work either. This si fucked.
[06:01:40] <Fenhl> Cork: I'm going to have a separate image stack for 2x, so it won't be that easy
[06:02:07] <Cork> joephilly: you need to load the js file in a tab and f5 if you want to work around the cache
[06:02:17] <Cork> joephilly: or you can just purge the cache
[06:02:27] <Cork> or choose not to use the cache
[06:02:30] <joephilly> you'd think shift or ctrl would do that....... dumb
[06:02:56] <Cork> Fenhl: actually it should be, if you base it on the same structure
[06:03:19] <joephilly> wtffffffffff.... still using old js
[06:03:20] <Cork> joephilly: those only affect the main page
[06:03:24] <joephilly> something is totally jacked up
[06:04:04] <joephilly> going to murder chrome
[06:04:22] <Fenhl> Chrome doesn't like clearing its cache, it's really bad
[06:04:42] <joephilly> how can I trick it into not being na asshole?
[06:04:44] <Fenhl> it even overwrote my symlink to /dev/null
[06:04:52] <Fenhl> I'm out of ideas
[06:05:21] <joephilly> hrm... it might be something else being stupid
[06:05:36] <joephilly> but I dont understand how
[06:05:50] <joephilly> even IE brings up the "wrong" version so I must be doing something wrong
[06:06:34] <JqueryHelp> I want every time I call my ajax page in ajax, it shows me my php
[06:07:21] <Fenhl> Cork: I don't understand. If I'm going to change my imageStack(images) to imageStack(images, hiDPIImages), I need to do *something* with hiDPIImages, not just change a function call
[06:08:01] <Cork> Fenhl: you could check for a value in the url to identify it as hires
[06:08:36] <Fenhl> Cork: oh, I can get an image's size using jQuery?
[06:08:49] <JqueryHelp> I want every time I call my ajax page in ajax, it shows me my php // Cork // i need help
[06:08:51] <Cork> Fenhl: you can grab the size of the img element
[06:09:47] <Fenhl> Cork: okay but what does that have to do with .prop('src')?
[06:09:52] <clunkychicken> JqueryHelp does it show the code when you visit the page regularly?
[06:10:16] <Cork> Fenhl: if you use prop('src') instead of attr('src') you will get the src the browser uses instead of the one you set in src
[06:11:33] <Fenhl> Cork: I'm not using attr as a getter anywhere.
[06:11:54] <Cork> ah, true
[06:11:57] <Fenhl> :D
[06:12:05] <JqueryHelp> clunkychicken: when I arrived the first time on the site I see the data, but after if I load a page in ajax and I come back on another page in ajax, then data is lost
[06:12:23] <JqueryHelp> http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/
[06:12:25] <Cork> Fenhl: well but well you could do something like $(this).prop('src').indexOf('hires') != -1
[06:12:33] <Cork> that was kinda my thinking
[06:12:54] <Fenhl> yeah, no, the image URLs won't look like that
[06:13:15] <Cork> Fenhl: i guess you could check if they exist in the array
[06:14:39] <Fenhl> well I haven't tried to implement it yet but the problem I'm seeing is that I'm going to have to check whether the regular or hires image failed to load in the error handler
[06:14:50] <Fenhl> and I have no idea how
[06:15:05] <Cork> Fenhl: i just told you
[06:15:21] <Cork> prop('src')
[06:15:49] <joephilly> .append('<li>' + value + ' File: <input type="file" name="files" id="' + value + '/></li>'); <--- can I do something like this?
[06:16:03] <Fenhl> oh now I get it m)
[06:16:16] <Cork> joephilly: you didn't close the id attribute
[06:16:20] <Cork> joephilly: but yes you can
[06:16:23] <joephilly> oh
[06:16:35] <joephilly> nice call
[06:16:53] <Fenhl> so you're saying prop('src') will be the hires one if the browser has the appropriate dpi
[06:17:08] <Cork> Fenhl: in the spec you linked to
[06:17:39] <joephilly> Cork, why does the browser keep separaing the File:  and input field into two lines when I do that? It's driving me nuts
[06:18:04] <joephilly> its going to drive me to use tables soon
[06:18:38] <Cork> joephilly: most likely cause you have something like input { display: block; } in your css
[06:19:05] <Cork> or cause the content needs to wrap
[06:19:17] <joephilly> I guess thats possible.. these crazy people have like 40 scripts referenced
[06:19:44] <Cork> joephilly: or ya, js could be doing something
[06:19:44] <JqueryHelp> i need help
[06:19:54] <joephilly> Cork, oh yeah, bootstrap.css is making input[type="file'} display:block
[06:20:02] <Cork> there you go
[06:20:11] * joephilly deletes that bullshit
[06:30:22] <Snoopal> hi guys im using jquery mobile and pagecontainer widget. when i use $('#page').pagecontainer('change',link,{}); i get in console the following error "Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on page prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'bindRemove'"

[06:40:24] <aro> i am not sure i understand
[06:40:33] <Fenhl> http://jsfiddle.net/beLTq/7/ could someone with a redina display or other hidpi screen please test this? it should show a face on hidpi and a pineapple otherwise
[06:41:11] <aro> Fenhl yes hold
[06:41:40] <joephilly> I see a pineapple
[06:41:51] <joephilly> because I have a regular shitty monitor

[06:42:18] <Fenhl> aro: hidpi and on a browser that supports srcset?
[06:42:49] <aro> i am on chrome on retina ios
[06:43:16] <Fenhl> ah, I don't think that has srcset support yet
[06:43:26] <aro> what one does
[06:43:37] <aro> ff? safari?
[06:43:53] <BillCriswell> Oh boy.
[06:44:11] <aro> oh boy what
[06:44:20] <aro> me?
[06:44:23] <BillCriswell> No no.
[06:44:35] <aro> oh ok
[06:44:52] <BillCriswell> JqueryHelp: What have you tried since we last spoke?
[06:46:23] <JqueryHelp> BillCriswell: function afficher(data)........ and append and function(html) but i don't know if it's work
[06:47:02] <hvgotcodes> can i refine a selector to include all elements with style left > 200px?
[06:47:12] <BillCriswell> hvgotcodes: Yes, filter.
[06:47:18] <JqueryHelp> i'm not very strong in js http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/
[06:47:32] <hvgotcodes> @BillCriswell: *without filter?
[06:47:34] <hvgotcodes> :)
[06:47:46] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').filter(function(){ return $(this).offset().left > 200; });
[06:47:50] <BillCriswell> Why without filter?
[06:47:52] <BillCriswell> Brb.
[06:47:54] <JqueryHelp> i'm not very strong in js http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/ BillCriswell
[06:48:01] <hvgotcodes> just so i can put it in the selector
[06:48:01] <Cork> hvgotcodes: selectors can't select based on css values
[06:48:06] <hvgotcodes> i can filter if ii have to
[06:48:08] <hvgotcodes> ok thanx
[06:48:44] <Fenhl> aro: i don't know about ff, but safari doesn't. webkit nightly does
[06:49:25] <aro> ok
[06:49:29] <aro> what browser do you want me to use
[06:49:31] <aro> and ill do it
[06:51:14] <Fenhl> aro: do you have webkit nightly?
[06:54:48] <JqueryHelp> BillCriswell: can you help me ?
[06:55:26] <Snoopal> omg i do not understand what i do wrong with pagecontainer widget of jquery mobile ./ i always get this error
[06:55:31] <Snoopal> very annoying :(
[07:04:33] <JqueryHelp> aro ?
[07:04:41] <JqueryHelp> aro:  I load an ajax page, which displays my php. then I change page and come back on my first page. given my php script "like" have disappeared

[07:05:25] <usc911> Hey guys, I have a large canvas (4000 x 4000px) with several divs scattered within. Im just wondering the best way to click on then move the canvas to the target? any ideas?
[07:05:45] <abishek> is there a way to find the resolution of an uploaded png image using jquery?
[07:06:18] <Cork> abishek: no you need to use <canvas> for that
[07:06:33] <Snoopal> im using jquery mobile and when i call "pagecontainer" widget i get this error "Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on page prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'bindRemove' " any idea how to initialize the widget correctly?
[07:06:48] <Cork> abishek: or you could give the blob to an <img> tag and grab it from there
[07:07:16] <abishek> Cork, can you advice on how to do it, may be a link that gives me an idea on what you are saying?
[07:07:33] <abishek> Cork, I was trying this http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/08/imageinfo-reading-image-metadata-with.html
[07:07:36] <Cork> abishek: google canvas image size or something like that
[07:12:47] <JqueryHelp> aro:  I load an ajax page, which displays my php. then I change page and come back on my first page. given my php script "like" have disappeared // please help me...
[07:12:57] <bowenac> anyone up? I can't get .dialog to work
[07:13:02] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/3a7MUiaR
[07:14:05] <JqueryHelp>  I load an ajax page, which displays my php. then I change page and come back on my first page. given my php script "like" have disappeared // please help me...
[07:20:25] <bengalo> JqueryHelp reproduce your problem/post your problem code here: http://jsfiddle.net and try to be a little more detailed of what u want to achieve and whats happening
[07:25:14] <joephilly> Anyone haev experience posting multipart form data using ajax?
[07:25:19] <Velveeta> bowenac: have you actually initialized the dialog as a dialog before trying to open it?
[07:25:55] <JqueryHelp> bengalo: http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/2/
[07:26:14] <abishek> is where a way to know if there a change to the src attribute of an image tag using jquery?
[07:26:50] <Velveeta> abishek: jquery doesn't have a way to track attribute changes, all you can do is poll that attribute and compare its current value to some previous value and notify something if it's changed
[07:27:07] <NoiseEee> abishek: or put a load event on it and monitor/check with that instead of polling
[07:27:09] <Velveeta> it's called dirty checking, it's how angular implements its own watch cycle on attributes
[07:27:31] <Velveeta> noiseeee has a pretty good idea there, given what that specific attribute represents in an image
[07:27:55] <JqueryHelp> bengalo: are you understand ?
[07:28:34] <Velveeta> jqueryhelp: i still don't understand what your original question was... and your fiddle is just a code paste, no markup or anything to go along with it, so we can't exactly see what the problem is either
[07:29:17] <bowenac> yea seems its a wordpress conflict as I am trying to use it in a plugin
[07:29:18] <JqueryHelp> Velveeta:  http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/2/  my problem is explained on this link
[07:29:24] <nisseni> I have this: http://pastie.org/private/dswuzl2jvu9yj4du4saaq - however, when trying to do productImage = getImageData(image_id) - I get undefined. However, console.log(data) in the method shows the data. What am I doing wrong?
[07:29:28] <bowenac> I used the whole script from jquery and the html
[07:29:32] <bowenac> still does not show it
[07:29:33] <Velveeta> no it isn't
[07:29:49] <BillCriswell> joephilly: You can fake it reliably with an iframe across most browsers. You would need the browser to support xhr2 to handle it for real. This article seems promising: https://www.alexanderschnitzler.de/blog/howto-build-an-html5-file-uploader-with-ajax.html
[07:29:51] <Velveeta> you have one comment that says "here my function used to load php whenever time my php ajax load"
[07:30:02] <bowenac> and I get TypeError: $(...).dialog is not a function
[07:30:11] <Velveeta> the rest of it is just code... that's not a question, or an explanation of a problem
[07:30:11] <JqueryHelp>  I load an ajax page, which displays my php. then I change page and come back on my first page. given my php script "like" have disappeared // Velveeta
[07:30:26] <Velveeta> yes, i've read that statement 4 times now since you keep copying and pasting it
[07:30:34] <Velveeta> but i don't understand what you're trying to ask
[07:30:42] <JqueryHelp> my php does not load once
[07:30:47] <JqueryHelp> my php does not load once Velveeta
[07:30:53] <joephilly> BillCriswell, yucky :(
[07:30:55] <Velveeta> so it doesn't load at all?
[07:31:03] <BillCriswell> joephilly: Agreed!
[07:32:32] <Velveeta> jqueryhelp?
[07:34:23] <Velveeta> alrighty then...
[07:34:35] <fels_zh> hi all anyone know their way around degrees and radians etc ?
[07:35:07] <joephilly> ya
[07:35:59] <Velveeta> joephilly celebrates both pi *and* tau day, he's all about that degree and radian math
[07:36:24] <joephilly> its true
[07:37:28] <nisseni> why am I getting "undefined" from productImage? http://pastie.org/private/ku18sxsotdiujoexb2o8w - when making console.log(data) in the method I can see the data
[07:37:29] <Velveeta> bowenac: sorry, your recent messages slipped right through my nets, let me scroll back and see what you said
[07:37:41] <nisseni> but I can't get it in return?!
[07:38:33] <Velveeta> nisseni: you're treating an asyncronous function call as a synchronous operation... you should be returning $.post, which will return a promise to the ajax request
[07:38:34] <BillCriswell> nisseni: That's not how ajax works.
[07:38:52] <Velveeta> you can then chain a .done() method off of that promise, and put your console.log statement inside of that callback
[07:39:24] <Velveeta> bowenac: you say you use the whole script from jquery, are you also loading jquery ui on top of jquery?
[07:39:36] <bowenac> no
[07:39:40] <nisseni> Velveeta: not sure I follow :/
[07:39:49] <Velveeta> nisseni: i'll demonstrate
[07:39:55] <bowenac> I just grabbed everything in the script tag
[07:40:03] <bowenac> not the whole example
[07:40:03] <Velveeta> bowenac: dialog is a jquery ui widget, you need to also load jquery ui on top of jquery in order to define that function
[07:41:31] <Velveeta> nisseni: http://pastie.org/8973320
[07:41:36] <bowenac> actually I think I am
[07:41:43] <bowenac> jquery-ui-core
[07:41:52] <bowenac> wp_enqueue_script(      array(          'iris',          'json2',          'jquery',          'jquery-ui-core',          'jquery-ui-sortable',         'jquery-ui-tabs',         'jquery-ui-slider',         'jquery-ui-datepicker',         'jquery-ui-autocomplete',         'tiny-mce-popup',         'shortcodes',         'media-upload',          'thickbox',     )   );
[07:41:55] <bowenac> ooops
[07:42:14] <Velveeta> nisseni: when $.post executes, it kicks off an ajax request, which takes time to complete, but it returns from the function instantly to continue processing other code, so at the time you're trying to reference 'data', it doesn't exist yet
[07:42:17] <nisseni> Velveeta: thanks, works fine!
[07:42:50] <nisseni> Velveeta: ok, I see - I "hoped" it would return it upon success, isn't that what the function should do?
[07:42:53] <Velveeta> nisseni: but $.post returns a promise object you can tack another callback onto, to be alerted when the request *is* complete, and receive the data that was returned, so any code that's dependent on the response needs to go inside of that .done() callback
[07:43:22] <Velveeta> nope, that's the whole point of ajax, is that it processes asynchronously, it allows your other code to continue running while it waits on that response
[07:44:14] <Velveeta> bowenac: i'm not sure what that wordpress function does, that's from php, i would need to know what actual files get loaded.. i'm gonna assume everything in that list, but that list doesn't include jquery-ui-dialog, only some of the ui widgets are present there
[07:44:37] <bowenac> its loading
[07:44:41] <bowenac> but still not popping up
[07:44:52] <bowenac> Velveeta http://adamcbowen.com/demos/calendar/calendar-test/
[07:44:58] <bowenac> click on a date
[07:45:11] <bowenac> it should pop a modal after showing the date alert
[07:45:31] <Velveeta> i'm sure it should, but like i said, you don't seem to be including the jquery-ui-dialog file
[07:45:50] <Velveeta> and looking at the page source confirms that
[07:47:14] <bowenac> <script src="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[07:47:51] <Velveeta> jquery-ui-*dialog* <-- *dialog*
[07:48:26] <bowenac> if you use firebug and go to scripts you can see jquery.ui.widget.min.js ver 1.10.3
[07:49:23] * Velveeta facepalms.
[07:49:42] <Velveeta> you're right, i do see that.. you're still no closer to solving this problem are you?
[07:52:07] <BillCriswell> joephilly: You really from Philly?
[07:55:22] <bowenac> ahhh thanks
[07:55:26] <bowenac> ok I am using that script now
[07:55:28] <bowenac> but same thing
[07:55:45] <bowenac> Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[07:56:24] <Velveeta> right, so that goes back to my very first question, which was "are you actually initializing it as a dialog before trying to open it".. that error would make it seem that you're not
[07:56:42] <Velveeta> you can't just call .dialog('open'), you first have to call .dialog and pass it some options to initialize it as a dialog
[07:57:06] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/1HM36f2p
[07:57:10] <bowenac> that is what I am using
[07:57:20] <bowenac> just like they are using minues the create an account function
[07:57:59] <bowenac> got it
[07:58:12] <bowenac> didnt rename that section it was #dialog not #dialog-form
[07:58:16] <bowenac> thanks for the help
[07:58:33] <Velveeta> i was just about to point that out, had to go dig out your original pastebin
[07:58:36] <Velveeta> ok, good to hear
[07:59:07] <Velveeta> and now, day-job-work calls, afk
[08:00:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: POOOOOOOOOR HELP
[08:00:57] <Velveeta> if you're poor, i can't do anything to help that from where i am
[08:01:16] <drej> maybe he wants poor help
[08:02:32] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure 3rd worlders aren't gonna be as well-versed in jquery as we are
[08:03:18] <Cork> Velveeta: as long as they care to read and learn i don't see why they wouldn't
[08:03:40] <Velveeta> they use different internets, our internets are the best internets
[08:04:11] <Cork> well sure, they usually have slower internet connection
[08:04:30] <Cork> but if anything that means you want to do more with the data you have sent
[08:05:17] <ankurk_> Well, I am stuck, can anyone help me out with this issue? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/49be8d0d3ccbb009aae8
[08:07:21] <ankurk_> Actually the error is "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[08:08:20] <Cork> ankurk_: sounds like you have something recursing endlesly
[08:09:07] <ankurk_> well, I just want to copy the div and append it on success callback with spans filled in from Ajax response
[08:09:18] <Cork> ankurk_: wait are you sure this is what you want to do $('.service-case-punchlist-row:hidden').clone().appendTo('#service-case-punchlist-body') ?
[08:09:53] <ankurk_> I am not sure to be honest
[08:10:04] <Cork> you cloning elements in the page with a specific class
[08:10:17] <Cork> and appends the clones to a div
[08:10:22] <trupheenix> facing a strange issue with jquery and dynamic datalist. When I append elements to the datalist, the focus goes away from the datalist. Also the suggestions in the data list don't appear.
[08:10:29] <Cork> for each loop you add additional numbers for each loop
[08:10:48] <Cork> so depending on the number of loops that can be a serious number of elements
[08:11:16] <ankurk_> yeah that hidden div, I want to clone it and append it for the number of items I get from ajax response
[08:11:38] <Cork> ya, but it will still be hidden
[08:11:43] <Cork> so you will match the clones too
[08:11:46] <ankurk_> well that whole structure is a table basically
[08:11:49] <trupheenix> anyone know what could be the issue?
[08:11:57] <ankurk_> so what I can do in this case then?
[08:12:06] <ankurk_> remove hidden class first?
[08:12:14] <Cork> before appending it ya
[08:12:38] <Cork> but the recursion problem sounds like something else
[08:12:55] <Cork> like an event firing itself or something like that
[08:13:40] <ankurk_> Actually the ajax happens on click
[08:14:11] <ankurk_> looks like removing the hidden class is working :D
[08:14:17] <krambiorix> hi, here is my problem :-)     http://pastebin.com/EAAKCNpd
[08:14:41] <ankurk_> krambiorix: that's a lot of classes :O
[08:14:56] <Cork> ankurk_: ah, it might actually be that you clone elements with the element you mach in them
[08:15:05] <Cork> ankurk_: so you get element clone recursion
[08:15:27] <Cork> that could cause it too
[08:15:27] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yes :-)
[08:15:28] <ankurk_> ahh! so removing hidden class is the solution
[08:15:35] <ankurk_> thanks Cork!
[08:15:47] <Cork> krambiorix: please ask a question, don't just throw a link in the channel
[08:15:49] <aro> has anyone used nestable
[08:16:01] <seutje> krambiorix: may want to just create an array an join it, for readability's sake
[08:16:40] <krambiorix> Cork, in the give link , i post my line where the error occurs. Below that , i posted the error. My question: i don't get this error, can someone please point out what's going wrong?
[08:16:43] <krambiorix> Better? :D
[08:17:03] <krambiorix> seutje, i did that, but posted the string for easier reading :D
[08:17:10] <seutje> oh ok
[08:17:30] <Cork> krambiorix: drom the on function??
[08:17:42] <Cork> what line in jquery is throwing the error?
[08:17:51] <krambiorix> Cork, the line i paste in pastebin
[08:18:00] <Cork> krambiorix: no that is in your code
[08:18:04] <krambiorix> ow ok
[08:18:08] <Cork> or do you mean the call crashes?
[08:18:23] <seutje> shit lints...
[08:18:24] <Cork> meaning the parser throws up?
[08:18:33] <krambiorix> Cork, 	type = core_hasOwn.call( event, "type" ) ? event.type : event,   -> jquery on line 2905
[08:18:52] <krambiorix> jquery crashes
[08:19:18] <Cork> krambiorix: what version?
[08:19:58] <krambiorix> Cork, 1.9.1
[08:20:26] <Cork> trigger huh...
[08:20:50] <shoky> `demo @ krambiorix
[08:20:50] <b-ot> krambiorix: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:21:11] <krambiorix> shoky, i think this problem doesn't need a demo
[08:21:32] <Cork> krambiorix: actually that was exactly what i was about to suggest
[08:21:33] <shoky> ...
[08:21:43] <Cork> krambiorix: try to reproduce the problem in a clean environment
[08:22:02] <krambiorix> :-)
[08:22:05] <krambiorix> damn
[08:22:19] <nisseni> Velveeta: when getting a response from the $.post - it's not in json anymore?
[08:22:20] <shoky> also don't paste different code than you're running, "for readability's sake"
[08:22:40] <krambiorix> shoky, other things?
[08:22:51] <shoky> what
[08:22:52] <shoky> ?
[08:23:00] <krambiorix> other desires?
[08:23:13] <shoky> yes, many
[08:23:27] <Cork> krambiorix: try to keep the obfuscation of the classes and things like that to a minimum
[08:23:32] <nisseni> Velveeta: I get an object with "responseText" where the data is, how can I use it?
[08:23:41] <And1> Hello folks. Maybe someone could help me with porting some javascript to jquery. I pasted everything to stackexchange and jsfiddle. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22681187/insert-and-delete-characters-words-in-headline
[08:23:51] <Cork> krambiorix: as it might provide hints on what your doing and if that might be the problem
[08:24:09] <Velveeta> nisseni: can you post an updated view of your code?
[08:24:11] <Cork> krambiorix: but it matters less if you can reproduce it in a clean environment
[08:26:20] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/8973320
[08:26:21] <krambiorix> ok Cork , thanks for the tips  + shoky  + seutje
[08:27:27] <Velveeta> nisseni: you're console.logging productImage in that callback, instead of data... i somehow doubt this is the actual code you're running, if you're seeing a responseText property instead of undefined
[08:27:56] <Velveeta> or else you're seeing productImage from some other scope that's bleeding into this one, and it's not what you think it is
[08:29:21] <nisseni> Velveeta: got it working
[08:29:26] <Velveeta> sweet
[08:52:10] <ankurk_> Well, this just appends the cloned div just once, http://jsbin.com/venopepe/1/edit. I actually expect the div to be appended on basis of number of items in the response
[08:52:46] <ankurk_> nvm solved it
[08:57:31] <ankurk_> btw is there any chrome extension which can help me monitor the memory usage by jquery functions and js files?
[08:57:43] <ankurk_> profiles is too complicated for me
[08:57:57] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to learn to use them if you really want to know.
[08:58:29] <repxl> what is a event firing like "on write" ??? i know .click event but i don't know how to do a autocomplete event so like " on write something" fire up something
[08:58:54] <duch_kazatel> repxl learn to use .on() instead of things like .click()
[08:59:20] <duch_kazatel> repxl .on() takes at minimim two args - the event, and then the handler - so .on('click', function(){});
[08:59:20] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: actually you're right.
[08:59:54] <duch_kazatel> repxl that being said, mind clarifying what "on write" means?
[08:59:57] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok and how i do "on write" :D when i start typing everytime i write a new letter lets fire it up bro
[09:01:01] <duch_kazatel> repxl there are three different keypress events - keydown: when a key is pressed down, keypress: when a character key is pressed, and keyup, when a key is released up.
[09:04:16] <Ownix>             console.log(currentNotification.css('display') === 'none'); results in Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLUListElement> has no method 'css'
[09:04:36] <Ownix> How can I determine if the element has a css method before trying to do anything with it?
[09:04:40] <duch_kazatel> Ownix because currentNotification isn't a jquery object.
[09:04:45] <duch_kazatel> Ownix jquerify it first.
[09:04:55] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  yes it is, sorry I forgot the full code
[09:05:15] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  full code
[09:05:17] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ysg32l8I
[09:05:27] <Ownix> well the important bits anyway
[09:05:34] <duch_kazatel> Ownix that's not a jquery object.
[09:05:47] <duch_kazatel> is runIndex a number?
[09:05:58] <Ownix> how? var createdNotifications = $('.noti-list'); then var currentNotification = createdNotifications[0];
[09:06:04] <Ownix> is that getting me the first one?
[09:06:18] <duch_kazatel> right - if you access the jquery array that way, you'll get the raw DOM node.
[09:06:34] <Ownix> oh. Is there another way to get the first one in its collection?
[09:07:22] <duch_kazatel> you have a few choices - currentNotification = $(createdNotifications[0]), or access it by doing $(currentNotification), or use assign it by doing currentNotification = createdNotifications.eq(0)
[09:07:41] <Ownix> whats eq(0) vs get(0) ?
[09:08:49] <duch_kazatel> look at the docs - .get() returns an element, .eq() returns a jquery object.
[09:09:12] <Ownix> its easy to forget sometimes that DOM element !== to a jquery object.
[09:09:49] <duch_kazatel> you learn eventually.
[09:11:16] <Velveeta> another thing that's hard for some people to learn is that javascript !== jquery
[09:11:27] <duch_kazatel> and jquery is not a language.
[09:11:44] <Ownix> Is there a reason this will always be evaluated as false?
[09:11:46] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/lWqZlnv9
[09:12:06] <duch_kazatel> Ownix because it's never display: none;
[09:12:17] <Ownix> So the code is working correctly
[09:12:38] <Ownix> One of the elements in there has style="display: none"
[09:12:51] <Ownix> However I get false for all of the LI elements
[09:12:52] <duch_kazatel> probably.  learn to use === instead of just == though./
[09:13:15] <Velveeta> that's syntactically valid, so are you positive one of the li's has display: none?
[09:14:23] <Ownix> yes
[09:14:24] <Ownix> http://i.imgur.com/SmE0b6q.png
[09:14:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/ see this?
[09:15:03] <duch_kazatel> Ownix fiddle it then?
[09:15:05] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: OMG this is so useful
[09:15:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hah this would have saved me time a few years ago.
[09:15:35] <duch_kazatel> javascript and type coercion can be a painful thing
[09:15:39] <Velveeta> i was a hard convert from double to triple equal.. i like implicit typecasting
[09:15:44] <BillCriswell> Yeah, go back and punch yourself in the face for using ==
[09:15:53] <duch_kazatel> I never use it.
[09:16:03] <duch_kazatel> except when comparing to null or undefined.
[09:16:06] <BillCriswell> Me either, sure I have in the past.
[09:16:21] <duch_kazatel> i was taught about that one early on so it became habit.
[09:16:42] <redondo> sorry, it there here support for jqplot?
[09:16:47] <redondo> is there...
[09:17:03] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ redondo
[09:17:03] <b-ot> redondo: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:17:05] <Velveeta> redondo: you an always try asking the question
[09:17:20] <Velveeta> that doesn't mean we'll be familiar with it though, but you can give it a shot
[09:17:38] <kelo_> helo.. how to create inline tooltip   like [enter your name here] , and disapear on click
[09:17:50] <duch_kazatel> kelo_ use powertip
[09:18:08] <kelo_> duch_kazatel: what is powertip?
[09:18:20] <duch_kazatel> a plugin that makes creating tooltips easy.
[09:18:25] <redondo> does someone knows where to dump new data for a line chart jqplot replot() call?
[09:18:49] <kelo_> duch_kazatel: thanks for the hint, i am googling now..
[09:18:51] <Velveeta> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+powertip
[09:19:00] <Velveeta> there ya go
[09:19:00] <kelo_> Velveeta:  thanks..
[09:19:15] <duch_kazatel> fun fact: i worked with the guy that wrote that.
[09:19:24] <Velveeta> powertip or lmgtfy?
[09:19:42] <duch_kazatel> powertip
[09:19:48] <Velveeta> just the powertip?
[09:20:02] <duch_kazatel> c'mon baby just the POWERTIP.
[09:20:09] <Velveeta> :D
[09:20:13] <kelo_> hey lmgtfy is cool.. how to create that with jquery?
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:20:23] <Velveeta> google jquery lmgtfy plugin
[09:20:26] <BillCriswell> It always works, always.
[09:21:11] <duch_kazatel> coldfusion is fucking terrible.
[09:21:30] <Velveeta> you know what else is? apple IIe basic
[09:21:34] <duch_kazatel> WORD
[09:21:38] <Velveeta> and yes, word
[09:21:44] <Velveeta> but not as bad as works
[09:21:52] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:22:34] <duch_kazatel> they finally started kind of getting things right with CFScript.,
[09:23:10] <slax0r> does .clone copy the element into a var?
[09:23:57] <duch_kazatel> it can be used to do that.
[09:24:45] <slax0r> oh my god....what I meant to ask is, does .clone autogenerate a new element and adds it to dom as a sibling or something to the original element, or does this not happen?
[09:25:25] <BillCriswell> It doesn't add it anywhere. It just creates a clone in memory basically.
[09:25:35] <duch_kazatel> it might put it into a document fragment.
[09:25:46] <slax0r> great, just what I need
[09:25:57] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I was able to solve the LI issue. However now my currentNotification does not have the method slideOut() http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:26:10] <duch_kazatel> Ownix try saving and repasting the link.
[09:26:18] <Ownix> whoops
[09:26:19] <Ownix> http://jsfiddle.net/c6t37/
[09:26:48] <duch_kazatel> Ownix did you look at your console?
[09:26:58] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  yes Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'slideOut'
[09:27:18] <kelo_> duch_kazatel:  i didnt find in power tip example that able to  add text on  text box and disapeare on click.. anything else?
[09:27:32] <duch_kazatel> kelo_ it handles the tooltip part for you....
[09:27:37] <duch_kazatel> you have to do the rest.
[09:27:50] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: createdNotifications.eq(runIndex) returns a jquery object, then why does slideOut() not exist?
[09:27:50] <BillCriswell> Previous developer floats EVERYTHING.
[09:27:56] <rolha> hi everyone, is this the right channel to ask a question about  jQuery mobile?
[09:28:16] <Ownix> Crap
[09:28:21] <Ownix> its slideDown and slideUp isnt it?
[09:28:47] <FlashSlayer> Hi. How to get all fields that are required with their labels? There is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/tZRpz/ Can jQuery get an element before/after given object (it can be in another DOM branch)?
[09:28:51] <duch_kazatel> Ownix probably.
[09:29:07] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hah, probably using FNE on that
[09:29:20] <BillCriswell> What does that mean?
[09:29:36] <duch_kazatel> Float Nearly Everything
[09:31:02] <jphase> FlashSlayer: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/tZRpz/1/
[09:31:05] <repxl> duch_kazatel can you imagine a ajax auto complete  from database ?
[09:31:08] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:31:18] <duch_kazatel> repxl yes, I can.  It's pretty common.
[09:32:53] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok i have coded this now it works but it has some mistakes like i use .append to put the data but as you write words the list gets bigger and bigger i have now like 5000 results for autcomplete :D i need something like when you write a new letter it removes the previous appended data and replace it with new
[09:33:23] <duch_kazatel> repxl then look at something like .empty() or .replace()
[09:33:47] <repxl> duch_kazatel or when i use .html instead of .append ?
[09:34:08] <duch_kazatel> repxl I'd use empty or replace, but you could use html instead I guess.
[09:36:12] <repxl> duch_kazatel yes html works good now another problem when i use keyup for example and now i want go with my arrows trought the list :D i cannot go becasue it basically refresh even on the arrow becasue i click the key :/
[09:36:32] <duch_kazatel> repxl i gave a list of the different keypress events.
[09:37:30] <repxl> duch_kazatel so you hint on using keypress and add exception on arrows ? that it will do nothing
[09:37:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:38:41] <repxl> duch_kazatel when a list popup and i want to switch to this list with the arrows i cannot because arrow is also a key down or up you know what i mean ?
[09:38:58] <duch_kazatel> repxl did you read the different keypress events?
[09:39:08] <duch_kazatel> you can also filter based on the key pressed.
[09:39:22] <repxl> duch_kazatel this is possible only in the keypress event right ?
[09:39:32] <repxl> duch_kazatel keydown and keyup don't have this feature.
[09:39:48] <FlashSlayer> jphase: seems to find fields properly, I will check tomorrow at work
[09:40:17] <duch_kazatel> repxl huh?
[09:40:34] <repxl> nothing ... i going to solve it u dont get it what i mean
[09:40:52] <duch_kazatel> I get that you want to detect a keypress vs a keydown
[09:41:04] <duch_kazatel> or that you need to look at the event data to see which key is pressed.
[09:42:19] <duch_kazatel> you could also use the change event instead.
[09:43:57] <duch_kazatel> though change depends on the user focusing out of the input.
[09:44:15] <duch_kazatel> either way, http://jsfiddle.net/2JsJP/1/
[09:44:44] <BillCriswell> How about the input event?
[09:44:51] <duch_kazatel> that works, too.
[09:45:43] <duch_kazatel> there are dozens of ways to do it.
[09:45:45] <BillCriswell> I wonder if my work offers to pay for conferences. An Event Apart in Boston seems like a good time.
[09:45:52] <repxl> duch_kazatel keypress is keyup + keydown combined right ?
[09:46:06] <duch_kazatel> repxl no.
[09:46:18] <duch_kazatel> Keydown triggers on any key press and gives scan-code.
[09:46:23] <duch_kazatel> Keypress triggers after keydown and gives char-code, but it is guaranteed for character keys only.
[09:55:14] <duch_kazatel> also: this coldfusion nonsense would probably suck less if i wasn't so hungover.
[09:59:37] <repxl> duch_kazatel can i show you my live example on my website ?
[09:59:56] <repxl> duch_kazatal it has a problem which visually does not look good
[10:00:01] <duch_kazatel> kay
[10:00:12] <duch_kazatel> i'll poke.  not sure how helpful i'll be though.
[10:00:59] <repxl> duch_kazatel http://gopanda.eu   log in with "kokot" , "kokot"  than click top right on "Nastavenia" and there is the first input box it says "PSC, Mesta" try to write something there slowly like b, a , n , s ...
[10:01:15] <repxl> duch_kazatel "prihlasenie" is login
[10:01:32] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea what i'm looking at here.
[10:03:06] <repxl> duch_kazatel the problem is when you start typing it works but it's flashy flashy it makes not a good visual effect it's not stable i cann't describe it when you go there and test it you see it
[10:03:22] <duch_kazatel> repxl you mean it disappears and reappears?
[10:03:30] <repxl> duch_kazatel yes fastly
[10:03:44] <duch_kazatel> are you using $.ajax() or one of its ilk?
[10:03:59] <repxl> duch_kazatel im using $post
[10:04:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah okay - so in the success callback of that, what's your code look like?  could you put that up in a fiddle?
[10:07:01] <repxl> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/BZ6VZ/  i found somehwere .done is like "success"
[10:07:20] <duch_kazatel> basically, yeah.  .done() is for the promises version.  smart to use.
[10:09:29] <duch_kazatel> I'd try using .replace() instead of .html() there.  basically, you should have a static parent container whose background is whatever background color it should be, and you'd have a child container that you'd replace.
[10:09:50] <duch_kazatel> that's where i'd start at least.
[10:29:04] <repxl> duch_kazatel replaceWith ?
[10:29:28] <jeremib> is this the proper way to get an array if data attributes using map?  jQuery('.asset_ck:checked').map(function() { return jQuery(this).data('item_id'); });
[10:31:31] <duch_kazatel> repxl yeah that might be it.
[10:34:21] <jeremib> .get is what i was looking for
[10:44:03] <repxl> duch_kazatel when i use replacewidth it seems work nice but the autocomplete don't change it works one time :D
[10:45:07] <repxl> duch_kazatel are you from sk or cz ? your name is familiar here
[10:48:07] <duch_kazatel> I know my name is, but i'm not from there.
[10:48:18] <duch_kazatel> and it sounds like your binding might be off.
[10:50:00] <duch_kazatel> repxl yeah if you're caching your selector, .replaceWith() won't work more than once.
[10:50:53] <repxl> duch_kazatel :D oh so how they do the smooth nice autocomplete popup without dissaper and redissapear fastly whick makes bad visual effect
[10:51:57] <duch_kazatel> repxl I all ready explained this.  you want to replace the contents of the dropdown, not the dropdown itself.  think about different ways you might do that.
[10:53:24] <repxl> duch_kazatel can you help me implement it inside the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/BZ6VZ/ instead of the .html im using  i trying to use this replaceWidth it works but ye one time only which is not great for a autocomplete
[10:54:07] <duch_kazatel> update your fiddle?
[10:54:42] <duch_kazatel> because it'd look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/BZ6VZ/2/
[10:57:18] <repxl> duch_kazatel huh :D that suxs
[10:57:49] <duch_kazatel> repxl huh?
[10:59:05] <repxl> duch_kazatel i found js ui has already done this
[10:59:10] <repxl> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#default
[10:59:11] <duch_kazatel> js ui?
[10:59:16] <duch_kazatel> oh jquery ui
[10:59:32] <duch_kazatel> sure, do it with that if you want.  i don't use JQUI.
[10:59:39] <repxl> jqui ?
[10:59:43] <repxl> ah
[10:59:44] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui
[10:59:45] <repxl> sry
[10:59:49] <repxl> y i got it sry
[11:00:09] <repxl> why you don' use it ? too heavy so the customers load longer the page?
[11:03:21] <duch_kazatel> I wouldn't say it's "too heavy" - it pre-rolls a lot for you and offers a lot of functionality.  I never really need any of what it provides.  If I'm going to include a lib, it needs to offer a lot of utility to me.
[11:03:57] <duch_kazatel> i like jquery because i use it a lot.  including jqueryui, even just the bits for autocomplete, wouldn't make much sense for me because i'd also have to include jqui core.
[11:08:15] <repxl> does anyone use the jquery ui the autocomplete ?
[11:08:23] <repxl> im trying to implement it into the existing ajax call
[11:08:38] <bberry> is there a way to swap 1 class with another in jquery?
[11:08:51] <bberry> instead of doing .removeClass(foo).addClass(bar);
[11:09:17] <duch_kazatel> bberry that's how you do it.
[11:09:24] <bberry> haha kk
[11:14:26] <shoky> also  .toggleClass('foo bar')
[11:14:57] <duch_kazatel> wait really?
[11:15:20] <shoky> not exactly the same functionality, but sure yeah
[11:15:49] <duch_kazatel> i mean i guess you could use this https://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/#toggleClass-functionindex--class--switch-switch
[11:16:41] <shoky> hmm i don't think i'd ever want to be using that one ;]
[11:18:19] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:29:46] <repxl> duch_kazatel can you help me with this replace :/  this jq ui don't work aswell
[11:30:57] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i'm too busy watching goat simulator videos
[11:32:03] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvWGLcdI8o8
[11:32:07] <duch_kazatel> it's just so beautiful.
[11:35:43] <ankurk_> In what cases it is recommended to cache selectors? Is it okay to cache them if you are gonna use it for two or three times?
[11:36:00] <duch_kazatel> always
[11:36:47] <ankurk_> hmm
[11:37:00] <repxl> duch_kazatel how should i do it when i once replaceWith a div its done i cant run it twice
[11:37:55] <duch_kazatel> repxl i showed you an example.
[11:38:07] <repxl> your example with .replace did nothing
[11:38:17] <duch_kazatel> it was an example.  it's not copy/paste...
[11:38:27] <repxl> is .replace even a function ? i only saw replaceWith and replaceAll
[11:43:25] <duch_kazatel> err, .replaceWith()
[11:43:27] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok look there you see i replacing the #kurac it works nice and smooth but after than it just stops because there is no more #kurac so when i type more i dont get updated autocomplete list . http://jsfiddle.net/BZ6VZ/3/
[11:43:27] <duch_kazatel> out of it today
[11:44:10] <duch_kazatel> does the content you're replacing have the #kurac ID on it?
[11:45:42] <repxl> duch_kazatel no  should i wrap it around the content im replacing also ?
[11:45:48] <duch_kazatel> ...
[11:45:59] <Ziarkaen> I have loop that runs through some DOM elements and is supposed to turn them bold one at a time, with a brief sleep between each one.  However, the sleeps occur as expected (verified throug console logging), but the actual boldening is "queued" up until the end of the whole loop, when everything turns bold at once.  http://pastebin.com/gZz1bzyS
[11:46:00] <duch_kazatel> you're targeting an ID that doesn't exist.  thing about it/.
[11:48:26] <apipkin> I'm seeing some code for jquery ui dialog where is only passes a string like `.dialog('close')`  Ive looked at the docs to try and find the meaning for string, but I can't find it. Any thoughts on what this string does or a link that explains it?
[11:48:58] <repxl> duch_kazatel it works now but it still flash:D look http://www.bazos.sk/  when you try to type inside : PSČ (miesto): it don't flash it just nice appears wow.
[11:52:31] <apipkin> Figured it out. It's calling a method on the dialog instance.
[11:52:47] <duch_kazatel> repxl right because they're changing a child container, not the parent container.
[11:53:33] <ankurk_> Is it possible to select just one selector in this approach? http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[11:53:53] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: $('selector')
[11:53:54] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ huh?
[11:54:17] <BillCriswell> Instead of $('selector1,selector2')
[11:54:41] <duch_kazatel> I don't understand what he means by "in this approach"
[11:55:03] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I don't even think this page should exist.
[11:55:03] <ankurk_> Well, I have this, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0fca408ff865d0e7862c. I don't know if it is possible but I only need to reference to '.btn-add-punchlist' using $(this)
[11:55:30] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ huh?
[11:55:36] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: this will be .btn-add-punchlist if it's clicked.
[11:55:48] <duch_kazatel> or it could be .btn-info-punchlist
[11:55:58] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ do you mean you want to handle each case differently?
[11:56:13] <duch_kazatel> like, the code path starts the same way and then diverges depending on the class?
[11:56:15] <duch_kazatel> or....
[11:56:42] <ankurk_> let me give you full function then, https://gist.github.com/gists
[11:56:47] <ankurk_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dc3a06cd25343a659333
[11:57:08] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't answer my question.
[11:57:34] <duch_kazatel> back up and explain what you're trying to do.
[11:57:48] <ankurk_> well, I just need reference to .btn-info-punchlist
[11:58:05] <duch_kazatel> then drop the other class from that second arg.
[11:58:06] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Just remove the .btn-info-punchlist reference.
[11:58:12] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: AWESOME IDEA
[11:58:18] <duch_kazatel> :D
[11:58:18] <ankurk_> hmm
[11:58:20] <ankurk_> phew
[11:58:29] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ what else would it be?
[11:58:46] <ankurk_> yeah, shit I need a coffee :/
[11:58:50] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Why is that even there?
[11:58:52] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:58:57] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ do you know what delegated handlers are?
[11:59:07] <duch_kazatel> I'd move that binding down further than document if possible.
[11:59:48] <ankurk_> Actually the buttons are getting added after Ajax call
[11:59:58] <duch_kazatel> still a good idea to bind further down
[12:00:04] <ankurk_> that's why I am using event delegation
[12:00:11] <duch_kazatel> to, say, the container before the stuff that gets swapped out.
[12:00:49] <ankurk_> hmm
[12:03:00] <duch_kazatel> ever have one of those days where you feel like you're just killing it at work?
[12:03:35] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: I need one of those days badly
[12:03:57] <ankurk_> sometimes I think I am not able to do that because of limited knowledge
[12:04:07] <duch_kazatel> you're learning.  you'll get there :)
[12:04:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I feel like that when I get to stay away from Drupal.
[12:04:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm having that with coldfusion today, and I know almost nothing about it.
[12:04:30] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:05:57] <ankurk_> ahh I know but I so want to build stuff and talk about at conferences
[12:08:29] <aro> has anyone used nestable
[12:08:33] <tucan> i have a situation where Bootstrap is adding default padding to its grid and my ads seem to be pushed to the right due to this padding, and I'm thinking maybe I can use a js solution to make the ad fit to screen, can someone help me this
[12:08:50] <aro> why dont you just override the bootstrap css
[12:09:18] <tucan> well it seems to be padding that affects the container
[12:09:41] <tucan> if i remove it, it looks ugly
[12:09:45] <aro> dont remove it
[12:09:47] <aro> override it
[12:09:52] <aro> be more specific with your css styles
[12:09:53] <tucan> override it how?
[12:09:58] <aro> derrrr
[12:11:22] <tucan> i've tried negative margins too
[12:11:29] <tucan> but that also failed
[12:11:41] <repxl> duch_kazatel im changing also the content like bazos.sk you saw it i replacing #kurac and i don't have the same effect like they hvae
[12:12:11] <tucan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11840706/how-to-remove-sides-padding-from-google-adsense-320x50-mobile-ad-in-twitter-boot
[12:12:22] <tucan> this is basically same question that i have
[12:12:37] <tucan> solution given was negative margins and it didnt work for me
[12:14:08] <duch_kazatel> all right i have to head out on lunch.  enjoy folks.
[12:23:51] <tandroid> How do you select the before and after pseudo classes in jquery? Shouldn't it just be $(".someclass:before")
[12:24:16] <systemfault> You can’t select pseudo elements AFAIK
[12:24:23] <tandroid> Oh no
[12:24:30] <tandroid> That's unfortunate
[12:25:53] <BillCriswell> tandroid: What do you need to do with it?
[12:26:42] <tandroid> I'm trying to dynamically apply a transformation to some display text. Part of the text styling is using the before and after classes.
[12:26:56] <tandroid> I think I can get the same text effect with drop shadows though
[12:28:02] <tandroid> That's probably the better route anyway.
[12:28:17] <BillCriswell> True.
[12:29:51] <jcutrell> I suppose I can bring this over here for the sake of interest - interesting “wobbling” bug happening only in Chrome on this pen. If anyone has any insight (I think it’s the arc method) I’d love to hear your experience: http://codepen.io/jcutrell/pen/jhCat/ (note - shamelessly cross posting from #javascript)
[12:36:38] <bberry> is there a way to get an array of the selected elements from doing like $(".myThings").on("click", function(){ var myThingsArr = ???? });
[12:36:54] <bberry> i want to get the array of things that has the myThings class i used for the selector
[12:37:12] <bberry> but the selector may not be a class, it may be a list of ID'ed elements
[12:37:51] <bberry> like $("#foo, #bar").on("click", ...);
[12:41:35] <bowenac> can someone look at this and see what is wrong its only 9 lines http://pastebin.com/uu881KjU
[12:44:51] <systemfault> bowenac: Looks okay
[12:46:07] <bowenac> would that look for any class of fc-day and if the data-date = date do something
[12:46:34] <bowenac> curently it doesnt seem to be finding any of the fc-day classes
[12:46:41] <bowenac> but I dont have any errors either
[12:49:36] <bowenac> maybe I need to add a .fc-day each
[12:53:34] <BillCriswell> Ninja Turtle trailer isn't as terrible as I expect, but I still hate it with a passion. That has to be good, right?
[12:53:58] <systemfault> BillCriswell: The only ninja turtles I liked were the 2 first ones.
[12:54:57] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Absolutely... Honestly, I'd like to see them aged to about 30 and have Jim Hensen Studios do the costumes again.
[12:54:58] <bowenac> anyone else got an idea? if I remove the if and just use each it will append each so something seems wrong with my if
[12:55:20] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I just can't get into the overuse of CGI.
[12:55:33] <bowenac> updated paste http://pastebin.com/sQk2CUca
[12:56:54] <systemfault> BillCriswell: The new one “could” be okay… :/
[12:57:16] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I'll have to see more of their personalities... it's all about the personality.
[12:57:28] <BillCriswell> Seems like they nailed Mike.. have to wait and see for the rest I guess.
[12:58:58] <BillCriswell> bowenac: $('.fc-data') will return the first every time in your if.
[12:59:09] <bowenac> figured it out
[12:59:17] <bowenac> didnt change the .fc-date to this after adding the each
[12:59:22] <bowenac> its working now
[12:59:23] <BillCriswell> Right.
[13:00:45] <rootshift> hi folks, I'm wondering why my variable calendar is being thrown as undefined as I'm using a non-conflict wrapper and the script is loaded after jQuery... here is my code. http://pastebin.com/YJCGwZkX
[13:07:26] <BillCriswell> rootshift: Are you trying to use calendar outside of the "non-conflict wrapper"?
[13:08:04] <rootshift> No don't believe I'm using it, I've commented it out and I seem to have the other code working okay. Is there a reason it is throwing an error if its uncommented ?
[13:08:29] * rootshift is trying to fix someones code :O
[13:09:32] <w00tb3ast> Is it possible to get the current applied value of a css attribute for an element? I have some columns and i want to write a function that removes one and because the widths are all applied in %'s I would like to add the % width of the removed column to the % widths of the remaining column but .css('width') returns the pixel value
[13:09:33] <DerKirche> is there somewhere to find legacy jQuery documentation? I'm working with 1.7.1 & for some reason $.ajax() is stripping script tags :<
[13:09:58] <BillCriswell> rootshift: I'm not sure where you're using calendar to see that it's undefined.
[13:10:32] <systemfault> DerKirche: Normal… scripts and innerHTML are not friends.
[13:11:07] <DerKirche> systemfault: is there any way to get around that? this is wrapped in some weird library from my client :/
[13:12:50] <Velveeta> huzzah! after close to a week of troubleshooting crap, i finally have a project up and running again so i can finish marrying up my front end code with someone else's back end code...
[13:12:56] <w00tb3ast> I guess a simpler way of asking my question goes like this: Is there a way to get the % width applied to an element not the calculated width
[13:13:15] <Velveeta> and for the last few days, the problem i've been chasing was a goddamn extra closing > in a web.config file <facepalm>
[13:13:24] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: It seems like you'll have to calculate based on the parent?
[13:14:07] <w00tb3ast> BillCriswell wouldn't it be possible to just pull it straight from the CSS otherwise the calculation needs to run every time the window is re-sized
[13:15:44] <w00tb3ast> the objective is to have say an element with a 50% width and one with a 40% width, when the 60% wide one is removed the function would go ok the element being removed has a width of 40%, the remaining element has a width of 50%, add the 40% to that and set that as the new style
[13:16:06] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: You could go through document.stylesSheets I'd imagine
[13:16:34] <w00tb3ast> that way if you had 3 columns say 20% 40% 20% respectively and you removed one of the side columns it would just go right well make the middle column 60% wide
[13:16:50] <w00tb3ast> BillCriswell ok I will take a look into that
[13:17:33] <BillCriswell> This is bizarre. If you do style="width: 20%;" on an element you can get it as a percentage with $el[0].style.width... but if you set that in the stylesheet it doesn't work.
[13:17:34] <BillCriswell> So weird.
[13:18:05] <w00tb3ast> that is odd
[13:18:52] <BillCriswell> At least that would save you from having to requery every time the window is resized, would just have to do it once...
[13:19:15] <w00tb3ast> Likewise it seems different that in IE jQuery apparently uses currentStyle which gives you the % back and other browsers use getComputedStyle to return a px value
[13:23:04] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: Yeah.. looking like it might be best to try another approach.
[13:24:33] <w00tb3ast> Yeah I guess you're right
[13:26:44] <w00tb3ast> I guess if I move the sass that is applied to each column to specify their width to a class on each column then not only could I let the user set that in the admin panel but also just change the current class on the remaining element to the one that includes the width of the removed column
[13:31:29] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: That sounds fancy. I have a hard time following things so forgive me haha
[13:31:40] <sqlnoob> I'm using jquery-ui but can-not center the ui-dialog on the screen. most interestinly the first time page loads, the dialog goes to the right but the second time, it gets centered correctly. anyone hit this issue? I'm using 1.9.2 jquery-ui.
[13:32:36] <w00tb3ast> BillCriswell no worries thanks for the help though :D
[13:33:14] <BillCriswell> No problemoooooo
[13:33:22] <Guest97438> Can anyone tell me please why don't I get any response from this ajax request http://pastebin.com/tnV37uXD
[13:34:10] <DerKirche> Guest97438: you getting 404s?
[13:36:31] <DerKirche> Guest97438_: you getting 404s?
[13:36:44] <Guest97438_> DerKirche: I am getting nothing
[13:37:02] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Look at the network tab, see if the request is being made.
[13:37:03] <Guest97438_> and in php I am trying to write variables to a file , still getting empty file
[13:38:09] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Also, should be listening for a submit event on the form, not a click on #submit. That could be bypassing everything depending how you're submitting the form.
[13:38:39] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: seems like request is not being made
[13:39:13] <BillCriswell> Are there errors in the console?
[13:39:20] <BillCriswell> Are you trying to call this from a file:/// url jawn
[13:39:47] <DerKirche> Guest97438_: does it reload the page w/ a # in the URL? - if so click should be submit
[13:40:22] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: no I am not trying to load it locally
[13:40:55] <Guest97438_> DerKirche: I will try it out
[13:41:07] <Parsi> is this wrong? $(this).delay(600).animate({ 'color': "black" }, { duration: 'slow', queue: false }, function () { alert("done"); });
[13:41:10] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: no , there are no errors in console
[13:41:30] <Parsi> it does not show that alert when animation done
[13:43:50] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell, DerKirche : changed the listener to submit event , still nothing
[13:44:21] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Did you change the selector as well? Believe your form was like .form-horizontal or something
[13:45:08] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: it has id info , so I have just gone for $("#info").on('submit', function() {
[13:45:29] <BillCriswell> Parsi: When you pass an object as that second parameters you need to use { done: function() { } } I believe.
[13:45:46] <Parsi> let me check
[13:46:29] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Try typing $('#info').trigger('submit') in the console.
[13:46:32] <Parsi> BillCriswell:                 $(this).delay(600).animate({ 'color': "black" }, { duration: 'slow', queue: false }, {done:function () { alert("done"); }}); still does not work
[13:47:29] <BillCriswell> Parsi: No, the second parameter.
[13:47:44] <BillCriswell> Parsi: http://jsbin.com/pikugowu/1/edit
[13:48:08] <Parsi> BillCriswell: ah, thanks
[13:48:18] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: hmm seems like my button wasn't submitting, interesting
[13:48:39] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Guessing some bad HTML.
[13:49:33] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: well , gotta read some bootstrap docs , cause I don't see anything wrong with that html
[13:49:50] <BillCriswell> Run it through a validator. =)
[13:50:32] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: anyways , since I am here , I am getting parsing error when submit is triggered , what could be the problem here
[13:51:02] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Well, what does the error say?
[13:52:53] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: I bet it's because you don't have an action attribute on that form.
[13:53:17] <Guest97438_> BillCriswell: hmm. let me check out if that is the problem
[13:53:52] <BillCriswell> That's not the cause of the parse error, but possibly the cause of the form not submitting.
[13:54:08] <BillCriswell> Shocked the validator didn't mention anything about an action attribute? Ah well.
[13:54:43] <Guest97438_> Well , I have added action="#" and now button submits , but i do get parsingerror
[13:54:55] <BillCriswell> Guest97438_: Yeah, totally separate things.
[13:55:43] <BillCriswell> Also, you'll need to prevent the default event.
[13:56:16] <Guest97438_> What you mean ?
[13:56:52] <BillCriswell> $('#info').submit(function(event){ e.preventDefault(); ... Then your code ... });
[13:57:05] <Guest97438_> oh
[13:57:08] <BillCriswell> I have to run though, good luck.
[13:57:16] <Guest97438_> thanks
[13:57:47] <g051798> Hello, I am looking for a jquery plugin that can visually create a filter string to select records from a single database table.  I would like for a user to be able to select options from a menu on the left such as value > x and product = A etc..  then show the filter selection visually on the right.  Can someone please point me in the right direction?
[13:58:58] <xsamurai> using preventDefault on pagination links to load content via ajax instead of reloading the whole page

[14:06:38] <duch_kazatel> good afternoon #jquery
[14:07:01] <duch_kazatel> Guest97438_ what line are you getting the parseerror on?
[14:07:03] <Guest97438_> good afternoon duch_kazatel
[14:07:56] <Guest97438_> duch_kazatel: after I submit my form it triggers this part of the code .fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus ) {               alert( "Request failed: " + textStatus );             });
[14:08:25] <duch_kazatel> Guest97438_ so your always getting your .fail callback?
[14:08:28] <duch_kazatel> *you're
[14:08:34] <Guest97438_> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:09:13] <duch_kazatel> what does your console say?
[14:09:28] <duch_kazatel> .fail() means that the ajax didn't work for some reason.
[14:09:55] <Guest97438_> well it actually gets 200 OK from process.php
[14:10:30] <Guest97438_> but it has bad time trying to parse forms to json i guess, how do i expand on parsererror so I see what it stuck on ?
[14:11:27] <duch_kazatel> Guest97438_  you're mixing callbacks and promises.  choose one or the other, first.
[14:12:15] <duch_kazatel> you should use either success OR done.  not both
[14:15:22] <Guest97438_> duch_kazatel: well it is not that critical , I mean before that I was getting no response at all , so I had to turn on 2 methods to get any callback from ajax , that's the reason I have them both
[14:15:46] <duch_kazatel> you should use one or the other.  until then, you'll keep having really confusing problems.
[14:16:08] <Guest97438_> duch_kazatel: anyways , deleting 1 of them is not resolving my problem , thanks on advice tho
[14:16:47] <duch_kazatel> start there, then keep going.
[14:16:55] <Ownix> duch_kazatel:  this does not work in IE 11, is this function depreciated?
[14:16:59] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Hy0ihsga
[14:17:21] <Ownix> location is a jquery element passed into my function
[14:17:51] <duch_kazatel> which function?  sort?
[14:18:28] <duch_kazatel> Ownix .sort() works for arrays.
[14:18:37] <Ownix> Let me show you the whole code
[14:18:38] <duch_kazatel> make sure that find is returning an actual array.
[14:18:50] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/QncWeR1u
[14:19:07] <Ownix> this calls the function
[14:19:11] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Q5vjc1wG
[14:19:35] <duch_kazatel> Ownix still not telling me anything.
[14:19:56] <Ownix> It works just fine in Chrome
[14:20:23] <duch_kazatel> without seeing it in action or the specific error message it's hard to help.
[14:20:27] <Ownix> $('.field-grid') is this <ul class="field-grid"><li></li></ul>
[14:20:33] <Ownix> there are no errors
[14:20:45] <Ownix> IE complains about missing closing tags, so that might warrant some deeper searching.
[14:20:56] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[14:25:22] <duch_kazatel> IE is much more picky about valid markup than other browsers iirc.
[14:30:04] <xsamurai> ankurk_: I am using both , http://jsfiddle.net/SC6tL/
[14:47:27] <Guest97438_> Guys anyone can simply explain me how uploading an image can be done through ajax+php
[14:48:17] <duch_kazatel> http://css-tricks.com/ajax-image-uploading/
[14:48:21] <Guest97438_> so basically I have a form which submits some text to php file , and I need an image to be uploaded from that form , how do I do that
[14:48:33] <Guest97438_> thanks
[14:48:40] <duch_kazatel> did you even try googling for it?
[14:51:37] <Guest97438_> duch_kazatel: I read the article , but that was not what I was looking for
[14:51:59] <duch_kazatel> uh whaqt else do you need then?>
[14:52:13] <duch_kazatel> you need ajax image uploading.
[14:55:14] <GotDC> duck_kazatel: did u get the idea what I wanted to do ? (got dc'd sorry )
[14:55:29] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:55:31] <GotDC> duch_kazatel*
[14:56:00] <duch_kazatel> oh were you the guy looking for a tutorial on ajax image uploading?
[14:56:07] <GotDC> yes
[14:56:19] <GotDC> I wanted to send image in ajax request to php processor so it stores it and writes the link in db
[14:56:25] <duch_kazatel> aaand i sent you a tutorial on how to do the first half.  google for the second half.
[14:56:46] <GotDC> I read that article that was not what I was looking for
[14:57:00] <duch_kazatel> that gets you the first half.
[14:57:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to do the research on the php side.
[14:57:41] <repxl> why i get something like this when i use ajax ? http://pastebin.com/zG4aARJJ  why i don't get normal just the echo
[14:58:30] <duch_kazatel> repxl huh?
[14:58:47] <GotDC> repxl gotta serialize i guess
[14:58:48] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok when i use post i have it without the eroor
[15:00:52] <repxl> how to convert a string to a array
[15:01:15] <duch_kazatel> you have to split on a value usually.
[15:01:17] <duch_kazatel> .split()
[15:02:05] <repxl> duch_kazatel because when i get this ["yes","yes2","yes3"]; from ajax and than i trying to alert it i get it like this however when i write this directly to js it creates me yes,yes2,yes3 when i alert
[15:02:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:02:42] <repxl> duch_kazatel normally ["yes","yes2","yes3"];  is a array in js
[15:02:47] <duch_kazatel> right.
[15:03:01] <repxl> duch_kazatel but when it comes from ajax it is not behave like a array
[15:03:15] <duch_kazatel> probably because you're returning it as a string.
[15:03:31] <repxl> duch_kazatel can be yes how i can fix it ? to not string
[15:03:48] <duch_kazatel> don't wrap it in quotes.
[15:04:00] <duch_kazatel> send over ["yes","yes2","yes3"];
[15:04:22] <repxl> duch_kazatel in php i have to wrap it like echo '["yes","yes2","yes3"];';
[15:04:44] <GotDC> what do you have in $.ajax
[15:04:46] <duch_kazatel> repxl then send that?  not sure what PHP is doing.
[15:05:21] <repxl> GotDC i have $post and than .done(function(data)
[15:05:29] <GotDC> you can use serializeArray i guess
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> that's not what he wants to do i don't think.
[15:06:02] <duch_kazatel> he has a return from his server - serializearray is for forms.
[15:06:55] <GotDC> I think he posted server response , so if u serialize a request it sends as a string , and in php he does echo $post , so he gets a string
[15:06:57] <repxl> duch_kazatel, GotDC my problem is when ["yes","yes2","yes3"]; comes from the ajax it does not behave like a array
[15:07:26] <duch_kazatel> repxl then response body should be exactly that.
[15:07:34] <duch_kazatel> and it wil behave as an array.
[15:07:47] <GotDC> repxl ,  that's what I am saying , if u r doing serialize , change that with serializeArray
[15:07:53] <Jquery_> hi duch_kazatel
[15:08:02] <duch_kazatel> GotDC that doesn't make sense - serializeArray() is for forms.
[15:08:31] <duch_kazatel> hi Jquery_
[15:08:32] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:08:51] <repxl> duch_kazatel so what can be the problem ? if i alert(data) i get ["yes","yes2","yes3"]; however if i create var test = ["yes","yes2","yes3"];   i get yes,yes2,yes3 and its the same..
[15:09:05] <repxl> duch_kazatel data is from the ajax from php
[15:09:07] <GotDC> repxl , you need to post ajax
[15:09:19] <GotDC> so we can see what u send
[15:10:40] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel: my php is not charging when I recall ajax (only my script "like"), else works
[15:11:21] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ that makes no sense.
[15:11:21] <repxl> GotDC, duch_kazatel http://pastebin.com/wAWcERve    and from the php i send the exactly same ["yes", "yes2", "yes3"];  but the alert is different
[15:11:58] <duch_kazatel> repxl do you have those comments backwards on lines 4 and 5?
[15:12:04] <Jquery_> excuse me duch_kazatel : my ajax does not load my php
[15:12:14] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ still nto making sense.
[15:12:20] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ do you mean that the ajax call is failing?
[15:13:08] <repxl> duch_kazatel y so you see what its returning
[15:13:40] <duch_kazatel> repxl use console.log() instead of alert and look at it that way.
[15:14:15] <GotDC> repxl , not sure why is this happening but i guess u can just split if u need it to be an array
[15:14:22] <Jquery_>  I have a button I like when I change page and I come back to the page the button I like, it does not charge me the information (number, or has already clicked)
[15:14:23] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea btw.
[15:14:33] <duch_kazatel> just send over the array.
[15:14:45] <duch_kazatel> alert() isn't going to work correctly because it's coercing things to a string first.
[15:14:51] <duch_kazatel> so use console.log() and look at the actual object.
[15:15:49] <duch_kazatel> the issue is that the return is probably coming with quotes around the array, instead of just the array, so js is treating it like a string.
[15:15:55] <repxl> duch_kazatel the one from ajax is black and the one which i created inside the js is red
[15:15:56] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel:  i have not error on my console
[15:16:25] <duch_kazatel> repxl right, remove the quotes around the return value on the php side.
[15:16:32] <duch_kazatel> not sure how you'd do that, but that's your problem.
[15:16:46] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ still not making sense.
[15:20:03] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel:  I have a button I like. when I get on the site it loads my php. when I load another page by ajax, and I come back to the page where this is my button, the ajax button no longer exists
[15:20:07] <repxl> duch_kazatel i want that my text from php will be handled like a array if i would write it directly to js
[15:20:35] <duch_kazatel> repxl right.  remove the quotes surrounding the return.  that will solve your problem.
[15:20:56] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ "a button i like" - you mean something you clicked?  what is "the ajax button"?
[15:20:58] <repxl> duch_kazatel in php like echo '[yes,yes2,yes3];'; ?
[15:21:08] <duch_kazatel> repxl i know nothing about php
[15:21:33] <Jquery_> yes duch_kazatel
[15:21:42] <repxl> duch_kazatel ok lets leave php lets say i just write it to the html like [yes,yes2,yes3];
[15:22:00] <duch_kazatel> repxl yep - as long as you don't put quotes around it, you're fine.
[15:22:07] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ what is "the ajax button"?
[15:22:34] <Jquery_> button like* in ajax
[15:22:55] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ still not making sense. can you create a fiddle to demonstrate?  or even just link me to the site?
[15:23:07] <repxl> duch_kazatel it's still black when it comes from the ajax aka "data"
[15:23:28] <Jquery_> yes in your mp i send a url of my site web
[15:23:36] <repxl> duch_kazatel i run $.post and catch the returning data here .done(function(data)
[15:23:45] <duch_kazatel> repxl that color means absolutely nothing to me.  go search google about how to return javascript objects from PHP.
[15:24:00] <repxl> duch_kazatel than i do console.log(data)
[15:24:05] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ please just link it here.
[15:25:21] <Jquery_> www.forusaway.net
[15:25:37] <Jquery_> just : J'aime (13), lost
[15:25:58] <Jquery_> all "J'aime (nbr)" lost
[15:26:40] <Jquery_> if you click on Accueil the number of "J'aime" are lost
[15:26:53] <Jquery_> he not load php
[15:27:18] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ so you're trying to use AJAX to update those?
[15:27:58] <duch_kazatel> ah i see - you're replacing the contents of the page with ajax.,
[15:28:06] <duch_kazatel> that's a php problem, not a javascript/jquery problem.
[15:28:09] <Jquery_> yes duch_kazatel  but i don't understand a method for resolved this problem
[15:28:27] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ you need to look at your server and see why it doesn't work when you ajax the content.
[15:30:54] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel: no it's not problem of php i have similary problem with my navigation i use $document................. and my problem resolved but for my script "J'aime" it's not work
[15:31:18] <duch_kazatel> jquery when i looked at the response from your server, it did not have the numbers in it.
[15:31:25] <duch_kazatel> that means it's a problem with your php.
[15:31:40] <duch_kazatel> unless you are filling those values in via ajax as well.
[15:32:21] <ModusPwnens> Does anyone know if there is an easy way to reproduce the automatic processing done for the data passed to ajax calls?
[15:32:40] <duch_kazatel> ModusPwnens clarify?>
[15:33:48] <xsamurai> http://jsfiddle.net/SC6tL/ , when the page content is updated with ajax the links dont adhere to event.preventDefault() , any reason why ?
[15:33:51] <ModusPwnens> So, for an ajax call, you can pass data to it. If you do not specify "processData: false", jQuery will transform pretty much anything you provide for the data attribute into the format required for the ajax call
[15:34:10] <Jquery_> yes ajax displays the number of "like" but it's php stock and calculates the number of "like" duch_kazatel
[15:34:19] <ModusPwnens> I want to know if there is an elegant way of replicating what jQuery does to transform the data into the format required for the ajax call
[15:35:08] <xsamurai> I am currently using on, i've tried delegate and the response is the same
[15:35:18] <duch_kazatel> ModusPwnens still not following - you mean where it'll convert data into querystring params?
[15:35:32] <imjakechapman> hey guys I have an even being automatically triggered when the page loads... what am I missing to have this function be triggered when something else happens... http://laravel.io/bin/POlP
[15:36:07] <ModusPwnens> duch_kazatel: Yes, but that would only be for GET requests. This is a POST request
[15:36:18] <imjakechapman> pub/sub would be way overkill for doing this only 1 time in my site, just curious why it's being ran right away and then not again when I'm trying to trigger the handler
[15:36:45] <duch_kazatel> ModusPwnens I must not be familiar with the massaging it applies to posted data.
[15:37:39] <duch_kazatel> ModusPwnens mind backing up and explaining why you want that?
[15:38:24] <imjakechapman> just realized that I had an extra d on the second... $win, that was a type... error persists though
[15:38:26] <Jquery_> i nedd help thank
[15:38:48] <imjakechapman> just realized that I had an extra d on the second... $win, that was a type... error persists though
[15:38:52] <ModusPwnens> Because we have an ajax request queue and we need to provide the data in the beforeSend method to ensure that the data is correct
[15:39:07] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ I'm still not understanding what your problem is.  it's very hard to understand why you simply don't just fix the php side to properly inject the numbers.
[15:39:19] <duch_kazatel> ModusPwnens aaah so you're validating it.
[15:39:36] <ModusPwnens> well, we aren't validating it. We are actually modifying it.
[15:40:30] <ModusPwnens> we are basically using the id of the last element on the list for pagination, but multiple delete calls in quick succession can cause a problem
[15:40:38] <duch_kazatel> i'd be interested to see what it looks like in the post body.
[15:40:42] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel:  because it's my script for "like"
[15:41:09] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ then you'll need to run your script in the success callback of the body replacing function.
[15:41:10] <Jquery_> i search my problem on my script
[15:41:59] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel:  it is long to do?
[15:42:10] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ huh?
[15:42:23] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ it's easy - find your done or success handler and modify it.
[15:43:04] <Jquery_> i lost for all my code, everyone tells me something different
[15:43:08] <xsamurai> ankurk_: nvm  got it, thanks for the tip =)
[15:43:52] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ still not following you.  i have no idea how everything is setup for you.  i'm giving you advice based on the assumption that you set things up in a sensible way.
[15:45:02] <Jquery_> ok duch_kazatel  it's very nice thank you
[15:45:57] <Jquery_> can you make me show what you would change or add to the world? http://jsfiddle.net/e4pwq/
[15:46:39] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ see that bit that starts with "success:"?
[15:46:43] <duch_kazatel> on line 14 in that fiddle?
[15:48:31] <Jquery_> ok but could you tell me the coded and explain the code you have written? duch_kazatel
[15:49:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?  i didn't write anything.
[15:49:58] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ wait, do you mean you want me to write the code to fix the problem, then explain it to you?
[15:50:23] <Jquery_>  is that you can write me the code that you wrote
[15:50:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:51:26] <Jquery_> yes duch_kazatel please, i lost very very i test many methods but not works
[15:51:38] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ i will not do that.  sorry.
[15:52:28] <Jquery_> then said to me what function ... I'm really lost
[15:52:49] <duch_kazatel> your code is likely broken within the success handler.
[15:53:29] <Jquery_> just for help me, this is not like asking one million dollars, is a line of code for me to understand please
[15:54:00] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ i am not dumping through all of your code right now - your success handler is probably broken.
[15:54:36] <duch_kazatel> i would step through that function to make sure it's doing what you think it's doing.
[15:56:04] <Jquery_> ok duch_kazatel thank very thank thank thank i'm blocked on this
[15:56:33] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel: want access to the ftp?
[15:56:36] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:57:05] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ this is pretty simple.
[15:57:47] <Jquery_> yes duch_kazatel  but i'm not expert and i'm really lost
[15:58:03] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ did you write this code yourself?  or did you ask other people to help you write it?
[15:58:45] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel:  I followed a tutorial
[15:59:42] <Jquery_> and my code is good coding no error
[15:59:44] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ so is precharger there you do the stuff for these numbers?
[16:00:29] <duch_kazatel> *where
[16:01:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah, it looks like you run Jaime.precharger(); to change out those values.
[16:01:04] <duch_kazatel> is that right?
[16:02:44] <Jquery_> yes i change jaime.precharger() for test
[16:03:23] <Jquery_> yes i change jaime.precharger() for test, but not work duch_kazatel
[16:04:47] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ and when do you run it after ajaxing in your content?
[16:08:01] <Jquery_> when I change page and I come back, it no longer loads the ajax =)
[16:08:20] <Jquery_> when I change page and I come back, it no longer loads the ajax  duch_kazatel
[16:09:39] <duch_kazatel> right.  when do you run that code after ajaxing in new content?
[16:10:28] <duch_kazatel> you have to call that code after ajaxing in the new page.
[16:11:26] <duch_kazatel> where are you doing that?
[16:12:46] <Jquery_> in the same page that is loaded at the entrance of the site, if we recall it does not load ajax
[16:13:17] <Jquery_> if click on Accueil (in menu) you see J'aime ()
[16:13:44] <duch_kazatel> where do you call it after ajaxing in the new content?
[16:13:49] <duch_kazatel> you have to run it again.
[16:14:11] <Jquery_> no duch_kazatel
[16:14:25] <duch_kazatel> yes, you do.
[16:14:28] <duch_kazatel> it's not an option.
[16:14:40] <duch_kazatel> you either have to run it again, or do it server-side before you ship out the new html.
[16:14:51] <Jquery_> ok
[16:15:19] <Jquery_> empty () my span class=jaime ?
[16:15:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:15:47] <Jquery_> or $document ready.....
[16:16:30] <duch_kazatel> you run it once when the page loads.  when do you run that function again?
[16:16:37] <duch_kazatel> document ready fires once.
[16:16:48] <duch_kazatel> once on pageload, and then never again.
[16:16:55] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, I'm just impressed you can make sense of this. Keep it up.
[16:17:11] <duch_kazatel> hah, i'm trying.
[16:17:19] <duch_kazatel> it's an obvious copy/paste job.
[16:17:20] <duch_kazatel> soooo.
[16:18:00] <NicholasC> Ah, that's not it. It's how badly the questions are formulated.
[16:18:14] <duch_kazatel> that too.
[16:18:19] <Jquery_> each time the page is loaded duch_kazatel
[16:18:20] <duch_kazatel> it's a basics problem.
[16:18:41] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ document ready fires when you first hit it. if you ajax in new content, it doesn't fire again.
[16:18:50] <NicholasC> Remember that print thing we discussed? With the iframe? It works in chrome and FF but not IE(not even 11). bummer.
[16:19:32] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  print thing?
[16:20:08] <Jquery_> can you show me how? duch_kazatel
[16:20:20] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, sec, let me grab the code/link.
[16:21:04] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ put that function call in the success of the ajax call that loads in pages.
[16:22:51] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, http://jsbin.com/visibege/1/edit this one. IE feels it's still part of the page and prints the entire page, not just the iframe. It's a blast :D
[16:23:02] <Jquery_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2520172/call-user-defined-function-in-jquery it is ? duch_kazatel
[16:25:22] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ this: Jaime.precharger();
[16:26:12] <duch_kazatel> you have to run that in the success handler within your ajax call for the pages changing.
[16:26:27] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC aaah i vaguely remember this.
[16:26:42] <imjakechapman> anyone familiar with infiniteScroll from paul irish?
[16:26:59] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, I don't need help or anything with it, I'm just waiting for a VM image to ftp. Figured I might as well see if I could help a bit here.
[16:27:09] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ imjakechapman
[16:27:09] <b-ot> imjakechapman: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:27:47] <Jquery_> ok duch_kazatel  please must renseigne me
[16:28:59] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:29:12] <NicholasC> Jquery_, assuming you're using basic jquery, your Ajax call should look something along the lines of $.ajax("url", {options});, make it look like $.ajax("url", {success: function(){Jaime.precharger();}); and that's it.
[16:29:28] <duch_kazatel> NicholasC here's their page: http://www.forusaway.net/
[16:29:32] <imjakechapman> http://laravel.io/bin/v6vq First click on load more posts works correctly, loads in the next post, but the navigation for next post disappears, adding a display: none;  on the pagination navigation wrapper, I've checked the totalPages for infiniteScroll since I'm setting it before hand and it shows the correct number of pages. If I remove the display none on the pagination navigation wrapper and reclick it loads the
[16:29:33] <imjakechapman>  last page.
[16:29:47] <NicholasC> Oh bloody.. it's French. I can't stand French.
[16:30:19] <NicholasC> duch_kazatel, he's aware he's missing a }?
[16:31:33] <Jquery_> duch_kazatel:  in events ?
[16:31:43] <Jquery_> i don't understand
[16:32:49] <ModusPwnens> So, I've pretty much exhausted the internet and I still cannot find a solution to this problem. Does anyone know how to modify the post data for an ajax request in the beforeSend handler?
[16:33:04] <Jquery_> i give up i sad for my script duch_kazatel
[16:34:06] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ you need to read some basics.
[16:34:38] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ where is your ajax call for changing the pages?
[16:35:24] <Jquery_> js/navigation.js duch_kazatel
[16:36:59] <Jquery_> i'm very bad in jquery i very sad but i only need it to continue its
[16:37:36] <Jquery_> have you tutorial in french ?
[16:38:13] <Jquery_> in french is medium explain
[16:38:22] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ in navigation.js you need to call that function in the success callback.
[16:38:34] <duch_kazatel> after this:  afficher(html);
[16:39:00] <NicholasC> You should really work on your English if you want to continue coding, Jquery_. Most of the docs and resources are just in English. No offense.
[16:39:48] <Jquery_> yeaaahhhh duch_kazatel  thanks i just put 	Jaime.evenements(); 	Jaime.precharger(); ???
[16:40:27] <Jquery_> NicholasC: thank very thnak for you info and cheer
[16:42:15] <Jquery_> thanks duch_kazatel  thannnnnnnnnnnk very very very much
[16:42:22] <duch_kazatel> Jquery_ you get it?
[16:42:53] <Jquery_> yessss duch_kazatel =)))))))
[16:42:56] <Jquery_> thanks
[16:43:13] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what you had to do?
[16:43:30] <Jquery_> even though I love the blocks
[16:43:37] <Jquery_> yes i understand :
[16:44:18] <Jquery_> navigation.js is the main file that loads the ajax duch_kazatel
[16:44:28] <imjakechapman> this is why I ask before taking the time to write an explanation of a problem. No on responds lol
[16:45:07] <duch_kazatel> imjakechapman we were helping other people.
[16:45:17] <Jquery_> very very thank duch_kazatel =) thank you so much
[16:45:36] <duch_kazatel> imjakechapman so your click hanlder isn't working on subsequent pages?
[16:46:35] <imjakechapman> duch_kazatel, it actually hides the navigation for next page.
[16:46:38] <imjakechapman> the first one is there...
[16:47:04] <imjakechapman> click it and it loads next page of posts, but the navigation wrapper for next pagination button gets display none.
[16:47:33] <imjakechapman> i'm working local right now, I have 3 posts and limiting posts to 1
[16:47:40] <imjakechapman> to have 3 pages of 1 post each.
[16:48:24] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  a cursory look at the docs shows nextSelector hides things.
[16:48:30] <duch_kazatel> rather, navSelector
[16:52:33] <imjakechapman> let me take a peek at the settings I have again
[16:55:10] <imjakechapman> duch_kazatel, doing a tiny screen record for you to see what its doing
[16:56:19] <duch_kazatel> nooo thank you.
[16:56:32] <duch_kazatel> any reason you can't setup a simplified fiddle and call an object instead of the ajax?
[18:20:12] <sammych> am I missing something obvious here, or so mouseup events not fire on overlapping positioned elements?
[18:20:17] <sammych> do*
[18:22:17] <sammych> http://jsfiddle.net/fw73E/
[18:23:20] <sammych> as in, I want all the elements under the cursor to trigger the mouseup event too
[18:34:03] <sammych> i found a workaround with elementFromPoint http://jsfiddle.net/fw73E/1/
[18:34:18] <sammych> well, made a workaround
[18:39:46] <__joshua__> if they are overlapping due to positions and not dom structure im pretty sure you have to use the elementfrompoint kludge
[18:40:15] <__joshua__> you can even loop while setting display="none" to each element you get from elementfrompoint, then show all at end
[18:46:01] <sjefen6> is there a way in js to detect is somthing is unplayable in a <video>, for example a pdf file?
[19:12:53] <LoneStar99> not sure if the following makes sense but need to capture text from an array of divs ->  http://jsfiddle.net/FT69L/
[19:18:14] <jphase> LoneStar99: the description is a bit confusing, but are you trying to do something like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/FT69L/1/
[19:20:12] <LoneStar99> jphase: yeah looks right "closest"
[19:20:13] <LoneStar99> lol
[19:20:27] <LoneStar99> will give it a try
[19:20:51] <jphase> you could also use .parent().parent() but I wasn't sure if your markup was going to change
[19:21:21] <LoneStar99> jphase:  great thanks
[19:28:05] <sammych> __joshua__: yeah, you'll find that's exactly what I did
[19:36:23] <LoneStar99> jphase: did u already have that code, or just wrote it upon request?
[19:36:42] <jphase> just wrote it... was pretty specific to your needs LoneStar99
[19:39:10] <LoneStar99> cool, thanks again
[19:39:16] <jphase> np
[19:39:27] <LoneStar99> you code jquery for a living?
[19:40:45] <jphase> I code websites for a living, jquery comes with the trade
[19:42:47] <LoneStar99> right on,  been using more and more jquery for my web service --> https://www.pozr.in
[19:43:28] <LoneStar99> jquery, php, and a whole lot of shell scripting and devops...
[19:47:15] <ZeroBeholder> I probably can't define my click event code in my constructor, can I? http://jsfiddle.net/CnZ9S/43/
[19:47:34] <ZeroBeholder> line 78ish
[21:50:36] <ManyouRisms> ugh. this is killing me. anyone know how to target an img with a particular z-index? i'm trying $("img[z-index=5]") and its returning [], when there's an img with z-index of 5
[21:51:58] <ManyouRisms> or do i have to .each() on the imges and compare the .prop("z-index") === 5 ?
[21:51:59] <jphase> ManyouRisms: You can only target elements and attributes from the selector. You'd have to loop through your images and use .css to check the z-index.
[21:52:18] <jphase> z-index isn't a property or attribute
[21:52:26] <jphase> it's a css declaration
[21:52:31] <ManyouRisms> damn, fair.
[21:52:45] <tandroid> you can use .zIndex()
[21:53:01] <ManyouRisms> is that a jQ function?
[21:53:04] <ManyouRisms> or js
[21:53:05] <tandroid> Yes
[21:53:08] <tandroid> jquery
[21:53:11] <ManyouRisms> whoa...
[21:53:15] <ManyouRisms> this stupid pocket guide
[21:53:19] <ManyouRisms> thanks guys ^^
[21:53:27] <ManyouRisms> and that just returns the zIndex?
[21:53:31] <ManyouRisms> as an int?
[21:53:32] <jphase> oh, didn't even know about that lol
[21:53:32] <tandroid> yep
[21:53:36] <ManyouRisms> coolio
[21:53:37] <ManyouRisms> thats awesome
[21:53:59] <ManyouRisms> ty ty. jphase: ya learn somethin every day :)
[21:54:05] <tandroid> I didn't know about it until now either :)
[21:54:16] <ManyouRisms> your googling skills are better than mine?
[21:54:18] <ManyouRisms> not suprising
[21:54:38] <tandroid> I'm more of a professional googler than I am developer
[21:54:42] <jphase> kinda handy since it checks the z-index of its ancestors as well
[22:02:46] <ManyouRisms> so that brings up a new question. each returns an Object rather than a jQuery object, therefore i can't use .zIndex() on it to return its value, and $("img").zIndex() doesn't seem to work either
[22:03:38] <tandroid> are you using $(this) ?
[22:04:22] <ManyouRisms> well, i've tried a variety. most recently $("img").each(function() { console.log($(this).zIndex()) })
[22:04:36] <ManyouRisms> i'm sorry just spamming keys now hoping it magically works
[22:04:46] <ManyouRisms> my console is about 20 bibles worth of text by now
[22:05:35] <tandroid> and you have set a z-index right?
[22:06:05] <ManyouRisms> yep
[22:06:10] <ManyouRisms> and there error is TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'zIndex'
[22:08:02] <ManyouRisms> I have three images, three buttons, each image should make the associated image have a zindex of 10, the current one of 5, and the other 0, then i'm to use animations to show the top one.  so.. i need to pass a current image to a function to make its zIndex 5. however the only way i can think of to target the current one is to find the img with a z-index of 10
[22:08:07] <tandroid> So I guess it doesn't work if the z index is 0. so that might be part of it.
[22:09:30] <tandroid> You can't use an incriminator to determine the current image?
[22:10:08] <ManyouRisms> yeah actually that was my next move, that or make an array and identify them that way. but i was just so hung up on trying to make this work
[22:10:20] <tandroid> look into .eq()
[22:10:21] <ManyouRisms> it sHOULD work from what i gather from the documentation
[22:10:30] <tandroid> each one should already have an id
[22:11:04] <tandroid> Or does have an id rather.
[22:11:37] <ManyouRisms> okay i'll play with that for a while
[22:11:52] * ManyouRisms puts his creative pants on
[22:11:59] <tandroid> good luck!
[22:12:05] <ManyouRisms> ty ty ^^
