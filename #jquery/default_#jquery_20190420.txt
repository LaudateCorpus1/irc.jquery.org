[04:20:24] <thebigj> Hello people, I am trying to find a better way to modulerize this code https://github.com/ultimatecoder/chatur/blob/master/chatur/source/assets/js/main.js
[04:21:01] <thebigj> You can observe I have a few methods which are more appropriate for an individual module rather than defining them here.
[04:21:21] <thebigj> I don't know how can I modulerize it in Javascript.
[04:21:26] <thebigj> Can anyone guide me?
[04:21:27] <thebigj> Thanks!
[16:51:07] <znf> How do I get the filename from a link without the extension? I tried: let a = $('a').attr('href'); a.substr(a.lastIndexOf('/')+1).substr(a.lastIndexOf('.jpg')-2)
[16:51:10] <znf> but that didn't really work
[16:51:31] <robertmaxrees> gotta quick fiddle?
[16:55:19] <znf> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/v6a0ex3m/
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> oof.
[17:00:30] <robertmaxrees> complete with exta periods in the filena,e
[17:00:34] <robertmaxrees> *filename
[17:01:03] <znf> yes
[17:01:57] <robertmaxrees> why not just deal with this as arrays nad call it a day?
[17:03:17] <pavonia> How would arrays help here?
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> series of splits and slices.
[17:07:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ex0py1jh/ just to make it as clear as possible
[17:10:22] <pavonia> My suggestion is `text.substring(text.lastIndexOf('/')+1, text.lastIndexOf('.jpg'))`
[17:11:05] <pavonia> substr uses first index and length, substring first and last indices
[17:17:27] <robertmaxrees> that's another options.  could also hit up ##javascript since none of this is jquery related :P
[17:36:43] <znf> thanks, that worked :)
