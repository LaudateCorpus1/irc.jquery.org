[02:10:37] <sydbarret> https://bpa.st/E3GQ  I have google_places_key variable in jinja. When it got rendered the api key is there so that means in production also will be visible by everybody?
[02:52:26] <Cork> sydbarret: again, why do you keep asking about google libs in a jquery channel?
[02:53:59] <sydbarret> sorry i thought i was on javascript channel
[02:54:10] <sydbarret> I fixed it anyway
[13:34:30] <audioburn> how can I use the editor to edit tabs programmatically? https://jsfiddle.net/hy8efjg4/ | source: https://github.com/0xfe/vextab
[14:53:21] <audioburn> can anyone help me? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63693316/how-can-i-simulate-typing-text-javascript-jquery-vextab
[14:53:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not a jquery question duder :)
[14:54:25] <robertmaxrees> and please stop shotgunning questions out to multiple channels at once audioburn
[14:54:52] <audioburn> dudebert
[14:57:13] <Turmfalke> Yeah, that's annoying as hell :S
[16:37:24] <grid-> hey
[16:37:34] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[16:41:11] <grid-> is it easy to add dropdown-submenu to all <li class="nav-item, only if that class comes directly after <ul class="dropdown-menu ?
[16:41:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:41:57] <robertmaxrees> think about it: how would you select all .nav-item elements within .dropdown-menu elements?
[16:42:30] <grid-> yes
[16:42:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
