[01:17:35] <fALSO> good morning
[01:18:31] <hyper_ch> hi there, I'm trying to add jqueryui tabs to the layout and it kinda seems to work. At first it loads the page, then changes it to the tabs layout and then it just blanks out  http://dragon.sjau.ch
[01:18:51] <hyper_ch> sorry:  http://dragon.sjau.ch/index2.php
[01:39:32] <radiodario> hyper_ch: your page is throwing a 404

[01:40:16] <hyper_ch> radiodario: but shouldn't that be prevented by

[01:40:20] <hyper_ch> 								"Couldn't load this tab. We'll try to fix this as soon as possible."
[01:40:23] <radiodario> don't paste here
[01:40:24] <radiodario> also
[01:40:34] <radiodario> we cant see your code, as we're being shown the rendered page
[01:40:36] <hyper_ch> sorry, usually 3 lines are permitted for pasting
[01:40:45] <radiodario> you will want to post it on a jsfiddle
[01:40:45] <hyper_ch> well, the source code is still there
[01:41:04] <hyper_ch> if you open the white page's source, you'll see it all
[01:42:10] <radiodario> nope
[01:42:21] <hyper_ch> works with chromium just fine
[01:43:14] <hyper_ch> radiodario: I did now comment out that one tab that isn't existing yet.... still white page after load
[01:43:21] <radiodario> hyper_ch: that's what's on my computer

[02:02:06] <hetii> HI :) I have frustrating issue, i get some pictures from piccassa and i put them by jquery into my site. $("#small-slideshow").getPicasaGallery(...) The problem is in that the content is loaded to late and the other library like slidshow or prettyPhoto don`t apply his job on those pictures.
[02:03:11] <hetii> any clue how can i solved that ?
[02:16:18] <webdev> hello all.
[02:22:36] <sgronblo> Is there something like closest but which searches downwards?
[02:23:03] <NodeX> find()
[02:23:19] <NodeX> parents('.foo').find('.bar');
[02:24:43] <alabd> Good day all , we have a jquery slide show module , it uses .mid format for playing sound , but internet explorer on win7 can not find it's plugin , is there any other format/way to have palying sound behinde a page without requiring installing plugin ?
[02:25:06] <Sebah> Am having problems with jQuery UI draggable and webkit browsers. Basically if the entire page is inview ( high resolution screen ) it works perfectly. But as soon as I resize the browser to 1024x768, let's say, the draggable jumps about 400px above the containment. I read that this is a known issue of draggable so I tried applying the hack ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3523747/webkit-a
[02:25:06] <Sebah> nd-jquery-draggable-jumping ), but no luck. I also have to mention that I'm using jquery 1.7.2 and jquery-ui-1.9.0
[02:25:45] <sgronblo> find doesnt check the element itself though?
[02:26:00] <sgronblo> and closest only returns one?
[02:26:24] <Sebah> ( also, the script works flawlessly in all other browsers )
[02:29:59] <Pymous> Hello !
[02:30:05] <L8> hey guys, has anyone here used/using jqplot?
[02:30:05] <Pymous> Using this plugins : http://pastebin.com/R4Aphbkm
[02:30:15] <Pymous> How can I access the create_choice function from outside ?
[02:31:09] <jcbk> can someone show me how to replace the previously added element rather than adding a <p> element whenever input loses focus? http://jsfiddle.net/6wADZ/
[02:31:14] <seutje> alabd: mediaelement.js might be of interest
[02:32:38] <hyper_ch> hi there, I'm trying to add jqueryui tabs to the layout and it kinda seems to work. At first it loads the page, then changes it to the tabs layout and then it just blanks out  http://dragon.sjau.ch/index2.php  -  source is here:  http://paste.debian.net/200987/
[02:37:15] <ink_> hello chaps
[02:37:18] <ink_> anybody around
[02:37:35] <seutje> jcbk: http://jsfiddle.net/6wADZ/1/
[02:38:15] <ink_> i'm using jQuery+mobile for touch events
[02:38:26] <seutje> jcbk: prolly better to abstract the setup bit to its own function though
[02:38:35] <seutje> so you don't have to do the check every time
[02:38:42] <jcbk> seutje: thanks!

[02:42:46] <ink_> If somebody could give me some insight into this
[02:43:03] <ink_> then they're going on my christmas card list this year
[02:43:38] <ink_> basically, i can handle events for the document and its elements withing a dynamically generated iframe, all except swipe
[02:43:49] <ink_> it works as expected on the parent docum
[02:44:21] <ink_> as i say, multicake bonus for anybody who can shed some light on it
[02:44:56] <Lucky--> if i understood coffeescript i'd help you
[02:44:59] <Lucky--> want to compile it?
[02:45:07] <ink_> if u look a little further down the paste
[02:45:13] <ink_> you'll see the compiled code ;)
[02:45:37] <ink_>   $(_this.contentContainer).hideOverlay(); <- ignore this
[02:45:38] <Lucky--> havent taken the time to learn coffeescript
[02:45:47] <rio{> don't
[02:45:51] <ink_> i've really taken to it myself
[02:45:56] <ink_> but each to their own
[02:46:13] <Lucky--> i am curious about typescript though
[02:47:22] <ink_> hmm, i looked it it briefly and didn't like it
[02:47:36] <ink_> having said this, now i look again, it looks quite nice
[02:48:21] <ink_> i went CoffeeScript because i'm while i'm from a C background, i've been working with Python now for a year or two and it's made me lazy ;)
[02:49:10] <ink_> and this is a sizeable project and i've always found JS a little bleh (blasphemy in here i know)
[02:50:02] <noaXess> hey all
[02:50:18] <ink_> anyhows, Â£1m and a free yacht for anybody who can help me :p it's looking more and more like i'm going to have to drop the iframe alltogether and get really strict with the guys working on the content so they don't fuck up the chrome
[02:51:44] <noaXess> i'm searching a method to handle the window close event.. onbeforeunload, unload... but i can't find any solution that works only if browser tab or whole browser will be closed.. onbeforeunload and unload will also be hired if F5 is pressed, a internal link/form/submit is done or you click into browsers address bar and press enter... hint's are welcome
[02:51:54] <ink_> last thing b4 i stop spamming the channel, this problem seems to be less about this particular code, and more about why click events would fire where swipe will not. http://pastebin.com/1Kbastjw TY for any help u can give me!
[02:53:06] <ink_> noaXess: don't quote me but i know some browsers won't handle what you're looking for gracefully as it could be abused for popups/impact performance
[02:54:09] <ink_> bleh, i hate xchat
[02:54:26] <noaXess> it is just in a special mode of the website, admin mode.. i want inform users that they need to logout first, before closing window.. but onbeforeunload will also be hired if you refresh site or click on yn link in the site..
[02:54:32] <noaXess> ink_: use pidgin ;)
[02:54:38] <ink_> oooo i can can't i :)
[02:54:38] <ink_> brb
[02:54:53] <noaXess> ink_: lin or win?
[02:54:58] <ink_> lin
[02:55:14] <noaXess> so use piding ;)
[02:55:16] <ink_> brb
[02:55:20] <noaXess> grr... pidgin
[02:55:26] <Lucky--> http://jsfiddle.net/bj5H9/5/
[02:55:27] <Lucky--> there ya go
[02:55:31] <Lucky--> whoever was having trouble with swipe left
[02:55:50] <Lucky--> pretty dang easy
[02:55:57] <Lucky--> once u ditch the coffeescript
[02:56:29] <ink_> ww
[02:56:30] <ink_> e,l
[02:56:34] <Lucky--> feel free to pay for my next months wow subscription.
[02:56:46] <ink_> back!
[02:56:50] <ink_> did i miss the solution :)?
[02:56:56] <Lucky--> http://jsfiddle.net/bj5H9/5/
[02:57:02] <ink_> without a word of a lie i might just do it if this solves our problems
[02:57:56] <ink_> ah i'm sorry i lied :-/ i'm actually using zepto and the swipe events are camelcased :-/
[02:58:14] <Lucky--> oh thought u were using jquerymobile
[02:58:39] <ink_> i lied, i thought i might get an angry mob if i mentioned zepto
[02:59:00] <ink_> i was working on the principal that if i was doing something wrong in jquery, the same would hold true for zepto
[03:00:46] <ink_> as i say, the code i pasted will work perfectly on the parent document, its just the iframe that seems to die. i wouldn't be surprised generally, working inside iframes from a parent doc is always a bit suspect, but it's implemented correctly (
[03:01:03] <ink_> as far as i can tell), and all other events (that i've tried) are handled gracefully
[03:01:14] <Lucky--> the iframe
[03:01:17] <Lucky--> is a completley seperate dom
[03:01:26] <Lucky--> and why do u need an iframe?
[03:02:04] <ink_> it know it is, and we're using an iframe specifically because of that
[03:02:10] <Lucky--> huh
[03:02:43] <ink_> it contains content created by non-technical people, we want to give them flexibility without encumbering them the restrictions we'd have to if we used the same DOM for the chrome
[03:02:55] <Lucky--> $().append
[03:02:57] <Lucky--> to a container
[03:03:02] <ink_> bluntly put: it stops idiots fucking up the chrome
[03:03:28] <Lucky--> $(content).html().appendTo(container)
[03:04:00] <ink_> i looks like thats going to have to be the way to go, but then we have to rely on them to write clean JS and that doesn't interfere with the chrome (the engine + controls that handles loading/manipulating their content)
[03:04:12] <Lucky--> users shouldnt get
[03:04:19] <Lucky--> any access to shit outside their scope
[03:04:24] <ink_> i agree
[03:04:35] <ink_> and with an iframe, they would have to start fucking with window.parent to do any real damage
[03:05:52] <ink_> just slapping their code in a container (and their code is currently at least, a full html document) will mean that they're in our DOM
[03:06:30] <ink_> simple example, what if they use a reserved class name? id? want to handle click events document wide etc
[03:07:13] <ink_> it's not unfeasable, but up til now we've been able to slap em in an iframe, give em their own DOM to play with and still have total access (because the iframe is dynamically created, we have no issues with same-origin)
[03:07:46] <Lucky--> zepto doesnt even work
[03:07:52] <Lucky--> ditch it
[03:07:59] <ink_> yep, this is the next step
[03:08:06] <Kcko> guys , how join to #php ?
[03:08:06] <ink_> i'm literally doing it as we speak
[03:08:13] <ink_> ./join #php without the dot
[03:08:19] <Lucky--> its events arent firing
[03:08:20] <Kcko> only invited ..
[03:08:21] <Lucky--> when they should
[03:08:24] <Lucky--> ##php
[03:08:37] <ink_> Lucky--: looks a lot like it doesn' it ;)
[03:08:44] <Kcko> omg
[03:08:50] <Kcko> Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[03:08:54] <Kcko> really complicated, sux it
[03:09:01] <ink_> you can try efnet
[03:09:08] <ink_> thats where #php was in my day
[03:09:09] <Kcko> :) stay at home // here //
[03:09:21] <ink_> gotcha, then learn rudimentary irc
[03:10:04] <ink_> right, i'm idling here now, i've been far too productive recently and traditionally IRC always fixed that
[03:10:04] <dblosevn> lol
[03:10:08] <SomeoneWeird> lol
[03:10:34] <ink_> ooo Aphex Twin...
[03:10:56] <dblosevn> think he might actually know how to join a channel hes here lol, he failed ident though possibly and thatchannel requires ident?
[03:11:21] <ink_> i think that error means your nick must be registered
[03:11:22] <dblosevn> hes a bot lmao
[03:11:32] <ink_> thats unfair
[03:11:37] <ink_> there are some very clever bots around
[03:11:44] <dblosevn> i know right
[03:11:54] <dblosevn> its been too long since ive used irc i forgot like everything
[03:12:08] <ink_> heh, first time ive been on in years
[03:12:08] <dblosevn> how the hell do i squelch system notifications for example
[03:12:40] <dblosevn> i used to do it, cant figure it out now though
[03:13:43] <ink_> we'll swap, you can have my code where events just don't fire
[03:13:59] <Lucky--> ink_: this works http://jsfiddle.net/bj5H9/17/
[03:14:02] <ink_> your "oh too many events man", falls on deaf ears chum ;)
[03:14:45] <ink_> possibly, but ive been round with this one, i dont think it solves my problem. however it is does, then there will be cake...
[03:16:16] <ink_> no joy i'm afraid ;( the same code is being used on a "local" container and works perfectly. but i do think you've got one thing right
[03:16:20] <ink_> zepto must die.
[03:16:28] <Lucky--> ink_: check the jsfiddle
[03:16:31] <Lucky--> i got it working using a plugin
[03:16:38] <Lucky--> https://raw.github.com/stephband/jquery.event.move/master/js/jquery.event.move.js
[03:16:50] <Lucky--> https://github.com/stephband/jquery.event.swipe
[03:17:03] <ink_> yes i understand that, i dont think you quite understand where im coming from
[03:17:08] <MiracleBlue> What's wrong with zepto?  :P
[03:17:12] <ink_> nothing!
[03:17:16] <ink_> i love it, but its not working
[03:17:19] <taylanub> how can i scale things with JQuery Animate ?  well, width/height does it, but makes for an ugly animation.  transform:scale() looks much better, but can't be done in .animate({})
[03:17:30] <MiracleBlue> Ooh, ok
[03:17:31] <ink_> these events are bound to the documentElement within the iframe from the parent
[03:17:41] <ink_> all other events work, just not swipe
[03:17:52] <MiracleBlue> Interesting
[03:17:59] <ink_> when i bind swipe on the parent (locally, if u will(
[03:18:05] <ink_> then all works
[03:18:33] <ink_> i'm gonna grudgingly use jquery+mobile for a moment, but i have a sneaking suspicion it wont work either ;)
[03:18:56] <MiracleBlue> ink_: Can I see a code sample?  :) I'll see if I can help
[03:19:05] <ink_> pls :) sec http://pastebin.com/1Kbastjw
[03:19:21] <MiracleBlue> Ooooh coffeescript :(
[03:19:22] <ink_> CoffeeScript at the top, JS below. If you have any questions ask (or read above)
[03:19:31] <ink_> heh, they all say that, see below for JS :)
[03:19:37] <MiracleBlue> </3
[03:19:39] <MiracleBlue> Okay :P
[03:20:17] <dblosevn> ah thats it /.set irc_conf_mode 1 i hate thoughs things
[03:20:45] <dblosevn> or not pos
[03:20:49] <dblosevn> i give up
[03:21:01] <MiracleBlue> Alright, what is the documentElement referencing, good sir?
[03:21:02] <ink_> this one module is 500+ lines, and that one of many in a "single page" application. i've found coffeescript makes me feel less intimidated by my own code :p also i'm a Python lout nowdays and coffeescript caters to my new found idleness :p
[03:21:18] <MiracleBlue> Ahh yeah ;) alright, you're forgiven (this time)
[03:21:44] <ink_> right. [iframe element].contentDocument.documentElement
[03:21:58] <ink_> in this case it's basically the $(document) within the iframe
[03:22:05] <MiracleBlue> Ahh got it :) so click is all working
[03:22:09] <MiracleBlue> But just not swipe?
[03:22:33] <ink_> yep, thats right. the same binding code works perfectly with swipe on the "local" dom so i dont think its a question of spelling/syntax
[03:22:44] <MiracleBlue> I've never tried detecting touch events on a document object itself.  Hmm.
[03:22:57] <ink_> i have a little earlier and it works ;)
[03:22:59] <MiracleBlue> Okay, so, on the top level document the same code works perfectly
[03:23:05] <MiracleBlue> Just not in the iframe?
[03:23:18] <ink_> also see the commented code above, where i bind to a class within the iframe
[03:23:57] <ink_> also doesn't work, and yes it's purely within the iframe, and as i said, it wouldn't surprise me iframes are fickle things, but all other events are working as expected. even ready()
[03:24:55] <MiracleBlue> Alright
[03:25:11] <MiracleBlue> Just for curiosity sake
[03:25:19] <MiracleBlue> Try binding to the body of the iframe instead of its document object
[03:25:35] <ink_> good plan, second pls
[03:26:41] <ink_> no joy i'm afraid
[03:26:47] <MiracleBlue> That's really weird
[03:26:55] <ink_> let me test in emulator again, in case in part this is chrome touch emulation failing
[03:26:56] <MiracleBlue> Could you try some touch events?  Like touchStart?
[03:27:11] <MiracleBlue> Ah yeah
[03:27:14] <MiracleBlue> That's entirely possible.
[03:27:34] <ink_> i have tested b4, but lets cover all the bases
[03:27:35] <Lucky--> ink_: maybe something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/bj5H9/26/
[03:29:21] <ink_> Lucky--: on the case, ty. MiracleBlue: are you and Lucky-- going to be around for a while?
[03:29:32] <MiracleBlue> I'm gonna be here a while :)
[03:29:34] <Lucky--> no

[04:01:32] <Lucky--> yea thats the shit that got me into it
[04:02:17] <oberhamsi> the current jquery-1.8.2 download has inconsistent line endings
[04:02:33] <oberhamsi> should i file a bug? i'm surprised this hasn't bothered anyone else yet
[04:04:16] <Lucky--> omg.
[04:04:18] <Lucky--> alphazone
[04:04:18] <Lucky--> <3
[04:04:56] <ink_> oberhamsi: inconsistant as in, some \r\n some \n?
[04:05:29] <kaspuh> Heya guys, I am new to jquery and javascript and I have a problem. I am trying to make a video that has display:none by default to be shown when clicking an ancor tag using jquery
[04:05:30] <kaspuh> http://jsfiddle.net/N8Wd4/
[04:05:54] <kaspuh> here is my code, i cannot figure out how to make it show. Can someone please point me in the right direction on how to do this?
[04:06:18] <oberhamsi> ink_: yes, apparently sizzle has \r\n .. most (but not all) lines between 3670-5327 are \r\n
[04:06:41] <Lucky--> MiracleBlue: heard alphazone before?
[04:06:48] <MiracleBlue> No sir
[04:06:54] <Lucky--> omg you will love this
[04:06:57] <MiracleBlue> :D

[04:07:13] <MiracleBlue> Dude were you ever into dream trance?
[04:07:16] <Lucky--> yea
[04:07:19] <MiracleBlue> Back in the early 2000s

[04:07:28] <MiracleBlue> Haha yeah man I LOOVED that stuff

[04:07:31] * kaspuh is listening to paul oakenfold- tranceport
[04:07:34] <Lucky--> and any sort of edm
[04:07:37] <Lucky--> lol thats oldschool
[04:07:39] <MiracleBlue> <3 oakenfold
[04:07:44] <Lucky--> before paul oakenfold was a fkin twat trainwerck
[04:07:53] <kaspuh> ^^
[04:07:57] <MiracleBlue> Oakenfold has been playing my track Calling on BBC
[04:08:05] <kaspuh> his tranceport album is good
[04:08:06] <ink_> oberhamsi: meh, i've never contrib'd to jquery b4, but if it were my project i'd just fix + send them a pull. that said, they might have a process for such tings
[04:08:16] <ink_> <3 BBC
[04:08:17] <kaspuh> bunkka was not so good
[04:08:20] <kaspuh> 3 drives on a vinyl atm
[04:08:22] <ink_> god we're great.
[04:08:50] <MiracleBlue> We're awesome
[04:08:53] <Lucky--> i remember when everyone looked at me when i was listening to trance and they are like 'dude . . . wtf are you listening to . . . change it.'
[04:08:58] <kaspuh> ;)
[04:09:01] <Lucky--> and now everyones like 'OMG Above and Beyond!'
[04:09:02] <MiracleBlue> Hahahaha
[04:09:13] <kaspuh> LoL, above and beyond....tssk tssk tssk
[04:09:16] <MiracleBlue> People still look at me funny when it comes to trance
[04:09:29] <kaspuh> Trance can be somewhat cheezy tho
[04:09:34] <Lucky--> deadmau5 has commercials for his album on the local radio now
[04:09:35] <MiracleBlue> yeah
[04:09:35] <Lucky--> lol.
[04:09:40] <MiracleBlue> Gotta avoid the cheesy trance
[04:09:58] <Lucky--> i need to go to glastonbury or creamfields sometime in my life
[04:10:11] <MiracleBlue> kaspuh: Wanna hear some of my tunes?  :)
[04:10:17] <Lucky--> http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/521818_3739817127135_806713009_n.jpg i splurged at edc

[04:10:19] <kaspuh> MiracleBlue: are you streaming them ?
[04:10:23] <Lucky--> and took a helicopter out with friends
[04:10:25] <oberhamsi> wierd, the line endings are correct in the sizzle github repo
[04:10:26] <Lucky--> was $150/head
[04:10:27] <MiracleBlue> kaspuh: No sir.  Soundcloud.
[04:10:34] <kaspuh> MiracleBlue: Got any mixes up?
[04:10:43] <MiracleBlue> kaspuh: Oh no, not mixes.  I produce :P
[04:11:15] <kaspuh> Ascension Someone Like You Paul Oakenfold Remix
[04:11:18] <kaspuh> after this track ^^
[04:11:25] <kaspuh> even tho it's a bit cheezy it's still epic
[04:11:28] <MiracleBlue> :D
[04:11:34] <kaspuh> I get the chills from it still :)
[04:11:40] <kaspuh> This whole album tbh...
[04:11:45] <kaspuh> but yeah, i'd love to hear some
[04:11:46] <Lucky--> that track was released about the same time i last used dcc
[04:11:46] <Lucky--> lol
[04:11:51] <MiracleBlue> Haha
[04:11:54] <ink_> oberhamsi: the CIA are changing your line endings.
[04:11:58] <MiracleBlue> The track that got me into trance was Sunblind by BT
[04:12:03] <Lucky--> fkin <3 bt
[04:12:05] <Lucky--> always
[04:12:06] <Lucky--> forever
[04:12:11] <MiracleBlue> Hell yeah man
[04:12:13] <Lucky--> especially his progressive breaks
[04:12:17] <kaspuh> He's pretty good
[04:12:22] <MiracleBlue> I think we need a #trance channel
[04:12:29] <MiracleBlue> So we stop flooding query :P
[04:12:32] <Lucky--> #electro
[04:12:35] <Xtrivity> hey guys. I am having troubles with keydown events. Here's my code: http://pastie.org/5067155 . Essentially I don't want the keydown to execute when it's in the function except as the normal keystroke of when i push a keydown a key it outputs the value of the key for example, if i put k, i want it to output k
[04:12:36] <kaspuh> yeah, not much jquery in here atm :)
[04:12:41] <kaspuh> i came her to get some help with a problem
[04:12:46] <MiracleBlue> Ah ok
[04:12:48] <MiracleBlue> What's the problem?
[04:12:51] <kaspuh> which reminds me, anyone wanna take a look at it?
[04:12:54] <Lucky--> jquery? javascript? whats that?
[04:12:59] <Xtrivity> MiracleBlue: want to take a look at that
[04:13:00] <Lucky--> node? huh>?
[04:13:02] <kaspuh> 2 sek, i post the link
[04:13:04] <Xtrivity> kaspuh -- what's the issue?
[04:13:18] <kaspuh> http://jsfiddle.net/N8Wd4/
[04:13:31] <kaspuh> I can't figure out how to the the video to show when the link is pressed
[04:14:01] <kaspuh> basically, i want to get the element to get "display: inline" when i click the url
[04:14:21] <kaspuh> and I am too darn daft to figure out why i cannot do it.
[04:14:27] <Xtrivity> kaspuh: put the <video> tags in a div. for css put display:none. and then on click "display:block"
[04:14:54] <kaspuh> oh. right
[04:14:59] <MiracleBlue> ^
[04:15:01] <kaspuh> I guess I am trying to overcomplicate things
[04:15:05] <kaspuh> using jquery
[04:15:16] * kaspuh smacks himself with a large trout
[04:15:20] <Xtrivity> If anyone can help me with my issue now - that would be great :)
[04:15:26] <MiracleBlue> Xtrivity: What's your issue?  :)
[04:15:32] <Xtrivity> hey guys. I am having troubles with keydown events. Here's my code: http://pastie.org/5067155 . Essentially I don't want the keydown to execute when it's in the function except as the normal keystroke of when i push a keydown a key it outputs the value of the key for example, if i put k, i want it to output k
[04:16:09] <Lucky--> MiracleBlue: give that a listen and let me know what ya think then im off to bed
[04:17:50] <MiracleBlue> Interesting
[04:18:19] <Lucky--> kaspuh: are you trying to make a nav menu?
[04:18:22] <MiracleBlue> So you basically want to listen for each key press, and then send the value of that key out to somewhere else
[04:18:25] <Lucky--> theres scripts and crap like sammyjs for that?
[04:19:01] <kaspuh> Lucky--:  Yes, I want the different videos to show depending on which link has been clicked
[04:19:01] <mazzachre> Is it better to dynamically add and remove "mousemove" listeners as needed or to always have them on?
[04:19:29] <Xtrivity> MiracleBlue essentially pressing "p" will popup a div. Now after that everytime I push P inside that div it doesn't show up because I have to do event.preventDefault. If i don't do the preventDefault it keeps popping up the div
[04:20:04] <kaspuh> Lucky--: Am I far off with my javascript code ?
[04:20:18] <kaspuh> Lucky--: Because, to me, it should work like that?
[04:20:39] <mazzachre> performance wise I was thinking.
[04:21:35] <xec_> Xtrivity: any chance you could make it a live demo on jsfiddle.net?
[04:21:45] <ink_> i'm trying to jig one up now..
[04:22:04] <Lucky--> kaspuh: http://jsfiddle.net/N8Wd4/4/
[04:22:09] <Lucky--> thats the easy way to do it
[04:22:17] <Xtrivity> xec_ one sec ill try
[04:22:18] <Lucky--> check out one of works in progress, 247cashnew.azurewebsites.net
[04:22:21] <Lucky--> and then click the menu links
[04:22:57] <ink_> so Xtrivity
[04:23:19] <Xtrivity> working on it.
[04:23:29] <kaspuh> Lucky--:  What is Sammy ? *Boggle*
[04:23:39] <Lucky--> basically a "router"
[04:23:48] <Lucky--> it captures hash's
[04:23:50] <Lucky--> and runs callbacks
[04:23:56] <Lucky--> it intercepts navigations etc
[04:24:17] <kaspuh> Ok. Sorry for asking, but why wasn't my code working ?
[04:24:20] <ink_> if i understand you, you want "p" to create (or display?) a div, and then you want to be able to type normally into, for example a textbox in that div?
[04:24:24] <kaspuh> If you don't mind explaining
[04:24:25] <Lucky--> idk
[04:24:28] <Lucky--> didnt even bother looking at it
[04:24:37] <Lucky--> just went the path of least resistance
[04:24:43] <kaspuh> :P
[04:24:47] <kaspuh> well, thanks a bunch :D
[04:24:50] <kaspuh> i apprechiate the help
[04:24:54] <Lucky--> http://jsfiddle.net/N8Wd4/6/
[04:24:56] <Lucky--> theres your code
[04:24:58] <Lucky--> actually working
[04:25:02] <Lucky--> i missed a ; and shit
[04:25:05] <Lucky--> its 424 am
[04:25:06] <Lucky--> lol
[04:25:36] <Xtrivity> here you go ink_ and xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/3JWEX/4/
[04:26:00] <Xtrivity> if you click in the main window and hit "u" on your keyboard
[04:26:04] <kaspuh> Lucky--:  :)
[04:26:05] <Xtrivity> it will popup with a div box
[04:26:16] <Xtrivity> but inside the divbox you will notice putting "u" will not show up
[04:27:05] <ink_> well at a glance
[04:27:45] <Lucky--> kaspuh: see how sammy makes that crap easy? :-)
[04:28:03] <kaspuh> Lucky--: still trying to figure out what it does. :P
[04:28:14] <ink_> sec, 85 == ?
[04:28:21] <kaspuh> I am new to javascript....
[04:28:22] <ink_> i'm being really stuid here, which key is this/
[04:28:24] <Xtrivity> ink_ == u
[04:28:49] <ink_> event.target
[04:28:58] <ink_> may be what you're after
[04:29:02] <Lucky--> kaspuh: http://jsfiddle.net/N8Wd4/10/
[04:29:05] <ink_> and u does show up for me anyway
[04:29:10] <Xtrivity> http://jsfiddle.net/3JWEX/5/
[04:29:11] <Lucky--> basicalyl sammy "intercepts" hash based urls
[04:29:21] <Lucky--> and runs the associated function
[04:29:27] <Xtrivity> ink_ go there. and if you type u. the div shows up but doesn't show up in the input box if you type u
[04:29:33] <ink_> ah intersting, when i add a alert it does
[04:29:35] <ink_> basically
[04:29:39] <ink_> you need to check event.target
[04:29:43] <Lucky--> so when i try to change my browser url to currentpage#video-local it runs that function
[04:29:44] <Xtrivity> yes i know when you alert it does.
[04:29:51] <Lucky--> instead
[04:30:02] <ink_> sec, ill do code 4 u
[04:30:04] <Lucky--> so you can just define each of your nav entries in that list
[04:30:20] <Xtrivity> cheers ink_ -- been playing with this for a while
[04:30:25] <kaspuh> Lucky--:  Hmmm...ok....
[04:30:35] <Lucky--> app.get app.post
[04:30:35] <Lucky--> etc
[04:30:42] <Lucky--> it'll inctercept that type of request
[04:30:45] <Xtrivity> kaspuh haha... you got the same nickname as my imaginary friend
[04:30:46] <Lucky--> matching that url
[04:30:54] <kaspuh> kaspuh ?
[04:30:58] <Xtrivity> you betcha haa
[04:30:58] <kaspuh> The friendly ghost
[04:30:58] <noregret> how can i loop this div and replace all 'index' with 'content' ? http://jsfiddle.net/TUmXR/
[04:31:13] <Lucky--> kaspuh: http://sammyjs.org/
[04:31:22] <kaspuh> Lucky--: thanks :)
[04:31:28] <Lucky--> kaspuh: http://sammyjs.org/docs/routes
[04:31:29] <kaspuh> i figured out what was wrong with my code as well
[04:31:43] <Lucky--> if you are going to expand past your code with more show/hide stuff
[04:31:47] <Lucky--> i'd HIGHLY recommend sammy instead
[04:31:57] <kaspuh> :)
[04:31:58] <Xtrivity> noregret when do you want to loop it?
[04:32:00] <Xtrivity> on click?
[04:32:06] <Lucky--> kaspuh: did u take a look at the site im working on?
[04:32:28] <kaspuh> 247cashnew.azurewebsites.net ?
[04:32:30] <Lucky--> yea
[04:32:37] <Lucky--> thats a staging server which is why its slow
[04:32:43] <Lucky--> test bed, free shit
[04:33:02] <Lucky--> click the nav links, the entire site is technically a single page
[04:33:07] <Lucky--> when you click the nav links sammy handles that
[04:33:16] <Lucky--> it swaps out the view
[04:33:44] <noregret> Xtrivity: anywhere, so yeah, a click is good
[04:33:47] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/3JWEX/4/
[04:34:10] <ink_> this what u were after?
[04:34:14] <Xtrivity> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/TUmXR/1/
[04:34:19] <ink_> sry for the delay, ur use of event was confuzzling me
[04:34:30] <kaspuh> Lucky--:  nifty
[04:34:43] <Lucky--> kaspuh: that help u understand a lil bit better?
[04:35:03] <kaspuh> I am a slow learner, i will have to read up a bit more on it...
[04:35:03] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/3JWEX/4/
[04:35:05] <ink_> simpler
[04:35:08] <Lucky--> if you hit back and shit sammy auto handles navigation
[04:35:14] <Lucky--> and history
[04:35:23] <Lucky--> click a link then hit back, you'll notice it works
[04:35:40] <Xtrivity> ink_ : you keep giving me the same link
[04:35:42] <Xtrivity> which does not work
[04:35:50] <noregret> Xtrivity: first, i want to loop all anchors, second i want to replace 'index' in the href with 'content', not a class :)
[04:35:54] <Xtrivity> can you save it and update as when i click "u" inside the input box, it does not show up.
[04:36:24] <ink_> sry, failed to click update
[04:36:55] <Xtrivity> ahh noregret: i understand one moment
[04:36:56] <Lucky--> aiight gn folks
[04:36:57] <ink_> not used to this fiddling
[04:37:10] <Xtrivity> ink_ nor am i. paste wen you have it working :)
[04:37:51] <benjick> Hey
[04:38:27] <ink_> ive updated, shud be on the same link
[04:38:29] <ink_> god knows
[04:38:52] <Xtrivity> noregret okay - I'll give you a hint as to what you should do. First you should make the links to each site a variable and then the path for example "href="+url+"/pathhere and then simply do an onclick as i previously showed you but change the url variable
[04:38:53] <benjick> I'm running "jquery validate" and i generate a few forms on one page, all these forms have the class "validate" but when i fill in one form the validator says the first one isn't properly inputed. How can I make it work with several forms?
[04:39:00] <Xtrivity> ink_ can you send me the link
[04:39:02] <Xtrivity> i closed it as it did not work
[04:39:23] <Xtrivity> ink_ (also if you hit ctrl + s) that saves it as well :)
[04:39:38] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/3JWEX/13/
[04:39:45] <ink_> ah i see, sry about that
[04:40:12] <noregret> Xtrivity: ok, but how can I loop them all in one click ?
[04:40:28] <Xtrivity> just change the url on click and that whill change them all in one click
[04:40:33] <noregret> Xtrivity: let's say a click on another button
[04:41:19] <Xtrivity> noregret changing the url doesn't involve the path therefore shouldn't be an issue.
[04:41:36] <noregret> Xtrivity: nop, you're not getting my point, suppose there is another button, not related to '.paging', i want that button click to loop those anchors and change the href, got it now ?
[04:42:12] <ink_> noregret: having a look now
[04:43:57] <ink_> hows about
[04:44:02] <Xtrivity> noregret: not really.
[04:44:14] <ink_> you apply a class to the links
[04:44:48] <ink_> and $('.link_class').each(function(el) { el.href = 'newhref'; });
[04:45:12] <noregret> i was trying var pag = $('.paging');pag.replace('index', 'atest'); but looks like selector doesn't return a string
[04:45:26] <noregret> ink_: cool, i'll try that
[04:45:30] <ink_> but than again, i just spent 10 minutes trying to understand how to save a jsfiddle, perhaps i'm not the one to lsiten to
[04:46:11] <ink_> sssh he's here, we'll talk more when he's gone.
[04:46:49] <MiracleBlue> :O
[04:47:08] <noregret> lol
[04:49:10] <ink_> i have to say, far i'm far to elite to stoop to reading trivial things like "The Manual"
[04:49:17] <ink_> while* im far...
[04:49:26] <ink_> the jQuery docs really are quite nice
[04:49:28] <xnotte> http://pastebin.com/r8c37siL  this works, but it puts two nulls, from <tr> <th></th><th></th></tr>, how can i ignore this ?
[04:49:48] <MiracleBlue> 31337
[04:50:55] <glauco291> I have an HTML in a variable, Can I manipulate this HTML using functions like 'find', 'val' etc.. I am trying '$(html).find('.d-command').val()' but does not work
[04:51:11] <ink_> $(html) ;)
[04:51:30] <ink_> it's entirely possibly you'll need to add it to the dom first
[04:51:47] <ink_> lol, thats not a helpful answer from me :p can you jsfiddle it
[04:52:15] <ink_> i'd do it for you but i'm busy skiving work
[04:52:33] <glauco291> I have got the HTML from a div, I need manipulate and replace some values using jQuery way instead .replace
[04:55:37] <ink_> thats really weird...
[04:56:12] <ink_>  oh duh, its a collections
[04:56:14] <ink_> -s
[04:56:14] <ink_> here
[04:56:35] <ink_> hmmmz
[04:58:26] <ink_> right, i suspect this needs adding to the dom...
[05:00:49] <ink_> wtf...
[05:01:08] <ink_> oh fucking jfiddle, what a cunt
[05:01:16] <ink_> so it does work and the env was broken
[05:02:24] <ink_> ok wtf, i can iterate over the elements in the variable, but not access their properties
[05:08:15] <glauco291> this is the pro
[05:08:19] <glauco291> problem
[05:08:28] <ink_> right
[05:08:32] <ink_> i'm genuinely perplexed
[05:08:32] <glauco291> I thin k that I have to use replace same
[05:08:33] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/auRhH/2/
[05:08:34] <ink_> this works
[05:08:43] <ink_> but look at it... i mean bleh
[05:08:52] <oberhamsi> i filed a bug about the inconsitent line endings in download release; http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12741
[05:09:59] <ink_> so just cleaned up a little
[05:10:04] <shoky> huh.. alert(this.id)
[05:10:05] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/auRhH/3/
[05:10:11] <glauco291> this 'each' iterates over each line ink_?
[05:10:18] <shoky> not $(html)[i]
[05:10:26] <glauco291> or each html dom element
[05:10:32] <ink_> each element
[05:10:36] <glauco291> each element
[05:10:36] <ink_> there are no newlines
[05:10:37] <glauco291> ok
[05:10:46] <glauco291> it's correct
[05:10:48] <ink_> again, i probs shud read the manual
[05:11:13] <ink_> rather than use this rather hackish feeling code
[05:11:29] <ink_> i'm assuming you're going to add these to the dom at some stage, else why bother doing it
[05:11:39] <ink_> they should be added and then changed
[05:11:39] <glauco291> I will
[05:11:55] <ink_> lol, well that 21 minutes of my life i wont get back
[05:11:58] <ink_> :p
[05:11:59] <ink_> weird
[05:12:04] <xnotte> http://pastebin.com/r8c37siL  this works, but it puts two nulls, from <tr> <th></th><th></th></tr>, how can i ignore this ?
[05:12:27] <kroniksenvy> Is there a jquery plugin page where i can ask a question regarding a plugin ?
[05:12:28] <glauco291> thank you for help ink_..
[05:12:36] <ink_> np mang ;) any time
[05:13:24] <ink_> xnotte: A) why not use an each to iterate over the td's and B) use and if statement to check for nulls
[05:13:37] <ink_> magic numbers in code are very naughty
[05:13:45] <xec_> kroniksenvy: not that i know of. feel free to post the question here - if someone is able to help, they just might do so :)
[05:13:58] <ink_> and you dont get much more magical than 0 and 1. also 8.
[05:14:07] <ink_> 8 is probably the most magical.
[05:15:20] <coppa> hi there
[05:15:32] <kroniksenvy> Im looking for a plugin that i could use to display data like so http://i45.tinypic.com/1rrot2.jpg  First collumn are categories, next products, next product info
[05:15:34] <ink_> eze coppa, all good?
[05:15:57] <ink_> pretty. i think what u need is CSS
[05:15:58] <coppa> hi there yep all right, happy cause my company finally opened the IRC ports
[05:16:00] <xnotte> ink_: why iterate tds?
[05:16:17] <kroniksenvy> Basically i have a lot of categorized data om db around 200 rows all diffirent products and i would like to present them as best as possible
[05:16:22] <ink_> ah i see
[05:16:55] <ink_> oh hang on, lemme check what eq() does ;) its entirely possible i'm talking absolute shit
[05:18:54] <ink_> xnotte: so ur just working with the first two rows, so i'm probably talking crap, i thought u were doing something else because i'm a bit of a pillock
[05:19:09] <ink_> w/e you just want to use an IF to check what ur appending to the array before you do it
[05:19:18] <ink_> otherwise ignore me ;p
[05:19:20] <shoky> first 2 tds
[05:19:41] <ink_> you think that i'd actually learn jQuery before i come to #jquery and shoot my mouth off. YOU'D BE WRONG
[05:20:25] <ink_> sry, two cols, ur quite right
[05:20:41] <ink_> listen i'm why they added the ignore function to IRC, its ur own fault for not using it
[05:21:18] <shoky> xnotte:  var tds = $(this).find("td");  if (tds.length >= 2) {  array.push( tds.eq(0).html(), tds.eq(1).html() ) }
[05:23:23] <ink_> btw off topic, but i just want to express my undying love for PyCharm, and all other JetBrains products
[05:23:44] <shoky> jetbrains rocks
[05:23:44] <ink_> (comes with JS/CSS/HTML, including jQuery support baked in)
[05:23:49] <ink_> seriously
[05:23:53] <shoky> WebStorm ftw
[05:24:05] <shoky> and intellij IDEA, of course
[05:24:19] <ink_> it's actually just plain silly how much better their IDEs are than the competition
[05:25:22] <ink_> IDEA is gorgeous, but i find i use PyCharm for everything really. I don't do any Java (except when extending IntelliJ products) and PyCharm does Python + the Web Dev i do perfectly
[05:25:25] <ink_> nothing is lacking
[05:25:37] <ink_> i have a terrible habit of not paying for software
[05:25:38] <mazzachre> Is it better to keep adding and removing a mousemove listener to different objects (in a mouseenter and mouseleave) or should I just add the mousemove to all elements in the beginning and just keep them?!
[05:25:46] <shoky> ya if i did python i'd imagine i'd be using that
[05:25:51] <ink_> i actually bought IDEA and PyCharm, even when i had a keygen for it
[05:25:56] <ink_> it's worth every single penny
[05:26:34] <ink_> i write in CoffeeScript (or for this project, somebody showed me TypeScript and i have to say, i may be working with that in future)
[05:26:48] <ink_> and pycharm even handles that beautifully
[05:27:27] <ink_> anyways, speaking of project, i've done sweet fuck all since i came in here to ask for help with a problem this morning
[05:27:45] <ink_> so IRC does what it says on the tin...
[05:28:17] <ink_> shoky: don't suppose you can shed some light on this can you http://pastebin.com/1Kbastjw
[05:28:37] <shoky> eh coffeescript
[05:28:40] <shoky> oh
[05:28:45] <shoky> js yay
[05:29:12] <ink_> i'll admit to using zepto rather tha jquery, but just make believe it jquery and see if you can spot any glaring omissions, the problem lies (i'm 99% sure) with the element i'm binding the event to
[05:29:19] <shoky> i know nothing about swipe events, sorry
[05:29:23] <ink_> documentElement == iframe document
[05:29:25] <ink_> np ;
[05:29:26] <ink_> )
[05:29:36] <ink_> i suppose i'd better do my own work :p
[05:29:44] <ink_> you're not rid of me yet tho #jquery
[05:30:22] <shoky> maybe they don't bubble up  the same? no idea
[05:31:06] <shoky> ink_: your js and coffeescript are different
[05:31:40] <shoky> your CS does event delegation for the swipes, your JS doesn't
[05:31:59] <shoky> anyway, still dono ;p
[05:32:03] <ink_> Â $(_this.doc.documentElement).on('swipeRight', function(e) {
[05:32:03] <ink_> ?
[05:32:07] <shoky> ya
[05:32:15] <ink_> Â  Â  Â  $(@doc.documentElement).on 'swipeRight', (e) =>
[05:32:30] <shoky> oh those are comments, k
[05:32:33] <ink_> what u might be looking at is the comment above (cs uses # like python), these were stippled
[05:32:35] <ink_> stripped*
[05:32:46] <shoky> ya nvm
[05:36:27] <mms_> http://jsfiddle.net/imiten/fDNjn/ ...hi I would like to get the form posted well but its giving error in submit.  The firebug shows the url as http://pinkydebian:8080/jax_rs_basic/%5Bobject%20Object%5D
[05:37:36] <shoky> mms_: you used .get instead of .post
[05:37:41] <shoky> i think..
[05:37:53] <mms_> shoky: no...I want to use get and post both for two forms
[05:37:53] <ink_> also by the looks of things, you need to serialize/stringify
[05:38:23] <mms_> ink_: yes more on that please...I thought I am already doing serialize on submit ....
[05:38:34] <shoky> mms_: with GET  you can't send any POST data ;]
[05:38:42] <ink_> :p
[05:39:02] <mms_> shoky: I want to do get request from that form ....it will send data fine I think by appending correctly ?
[05:39:07] <ink_> sry im being annoyingly lazy, all i can see is the URL pasted and that shows a string representation of the type, not the value, so it will need to be address
[05:39:24] <ink_> addresses*
[05:39:25] <ink_> d*
[05:39:51] <mms_> well I have provided the form on jsfiddle ...please correct there if needed
[05:40:17] <ink_> when i click the buttons on ur fiddle
[05:40:20] <mms_> some how I am confused how come the url has object in it
[05:40:25] <ink_> it seems to be requesting valid urls
[05:40:28] <ink_> no sign of object
[05:40:37] <mms_> then in firebug why it shows so ?
[05:40:38] <ink_> try clearing ur cache possibly
[05:40:45] <ink_> because firebug hates you
[05:40:47] <mms_> the request is no reaching ther server at all
[05:40:55] <ink_> if u have chrome to hand, i'd give it a shot on that
[05:41:04] <ink_> the JS fiddle obv doesn't work cos its not ur server
[05:41:25] <mms_> I get 404 error on that url
[05:41:37] <ink_> u would, because
[05:41:51] <shoky> he's right. chrome shows: http://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/[object%20Object]
[05:41:54] <ink_> GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/jax_rs_basic/cxf/json/max?num1=&num2=&num3=&submit=get+max 404 (NOT FOUND)
[05:42:03] <shoky> for me anyway
[05:42:04] <ink_> GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/jax_rs_basic/cxf/json/range?from=&to=&submit=get+range 404 (NOT FOUND)
[05:42:09] <ink_> s'what im getting
[05:42:17] <ink_> thats just from clicking the buttons on the jsfiddle
[05:42:20] <mms_> ink_: yes it makes sense that on fiddle it will do so but for me why ?
[05:42:46] <ink_> i wud check ur environment, i know it seems obvious but it happens
[05:42:49] <seutje> mms_: get and post expect a bunch of strings as parameters (and a function), but not an object
[05:42:52] <shoky> oh.
[05:42:57] <shoky> yeah exactly
[05:43:08] <shoky> wrong arguments
[05:43:12] <seutje> (another reason I don't use these convenience shorthand functions)
[05:43:16] <ink_> i thought he was serializing it? fuck knows, i'd love to stay and check but i need to run
[05:43:18] <mms_> well where am I sending object ? you mean serialize is incorrect ?
[05:43:26] <seutje> no
[05:43:27] <shoky> mms_: you are sending an object literal as argument to .get
[05:43:27] <mms_> I should use stringify ?
[05:43:33] <seutje> the arguments to $.get() are wrong
[05:43:42] <mms_> seutje: let me see
[05:43:45] <seutje> it expects a list of arguments, not a single object containing them all
[05:43:56] <ink_> gah sry, jsfiddle did not have jquery loaded
[05:44:13] <ink_> now im getting some proper fail, kl
[05:44:13] <ink_> sexc
[05:44:14] <seutje> url is the first argument, so it just tries to use the entire argument object as "the url"
[05:44:27] <ink_> ah :)
[05:45:24] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/fDNjn/1/
[05:45:25] <mms_> I got mixed up with .ajax and .get may be
[05:45:26] <ink_> still full of errors
[05:45:30] <ink_> but there ^
[05:46:05] <shoky> still wrong, ink_ :)
[05:46:31] <seutje> mms_: fixed the get max form: http://jsfiddle.net/fDNjn/2/
[05:46:41] <shoky> ?get
[05:46:42] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[05:46:48] <shoky> ?jQuery.get
[05:46:49] <bot-t> jQuery.get(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[05:47:04] <seutje> so, $.get doesn't even support failure handler?
[05:47:08] <ink_> ur using submit() which makes and actual postback
[05:47:10] <ink_> you want ajax
[05:47:14] <shoky> seutje  it does
[05:47:22] <shoky> all ajax commands return a jqXHR
[05:47:28] <shoky> which has  .done .fail .always
[05:47:40] <seutje> yeah, so $.get doesn't support it, deffereds still do
[05:47:46] <shoky> $.get returns a deferred
[05:47:51] <seutje> defferreds* ?
[05:47:52] <shoky> because $.ajax returns one..
[05:47:55] <mms_> http://jsfiddle.net/imiten/fDNjn/4/
[05:47:58] <shoky> and $.get is a shortcut
[05:47:58] <seutje> I can never spell (or pronounce) that
[05:48:01] <mms_> ok its hitting the server at least now
[05:48:07] <seutje> screw them shortcuts
[05:48:10] <shoky> $.get(...).fail(function() { alert('NOOO') })
[05:48:24] <seutje> so why offer to pass a success handler?
[05:48:29] <mms_> I got away with get / post and use ajax now
[05:48:35] <mms_> but it gives 400 error
[05:49:02] <shoky> seutje because that's the most commonly used, and probably has to do with historical shit
[05:49:12] <shoky> like.. it wasn't always running on deferreds
[05:49:20] <seutje> I wish they'd just ditch all those shorthands
[05:49:28] <seutje> more confusion than anything else
[05:51:35] <shoky> well, we got to meet mms_ so...
[05:54:24] <mms_> shoky: what happened ?
[05:54:47] <mms_> shoky: I am able to hit the service now but then its not invoking my jaxrs service

[06:11:26] <jrajav> Can anyone take a look at me and tell me why it causes most of the page to reflow about 3em upwards every time originalImage.mouseenter is triggered?
[06:11:31] <jrajav> https://gist.github.com/3899171
[06:11:38] <jrajav> ^ that's "me" lol
[06:11:50] <jrajav> Meant "my script" :P
[06:12:09] <jrajav> This is the JS side of a Wikipedia skin
[06:12:34] <jrajav> Oh, it only does that the first time it's triggered, actually
[06:12:42] <shoky> jrajav: i don't think we can figure anything out just by looking at the code..
[06:12:56] <shoky> (or at you)
[06:12:57] <jrajav> Maybe someone can
[06:13:01] <jrajav> It's worth a shot
[06:13:06] <jrajav> I have no clue
[06:13:12] <shoky> all your mouseenter does is replace an image's src
[06:13:22] <shoky> how are we supposed to know what that does on your specific page?
[06:13:30] <shoky> without seeing it in action
[06:13:47] <jrajav> You can see it in action by setting it on your own Wikipedia account if you want
[06:13:53] <jrajav> Pretty hard to make it a fiddle or something
[06:14:06] <shoky> i'm sure it's pretty easy
[06:14:14] <jrajav> Replacing the img's src in this case means that it will load the img, since I'm creating those img elements from scratch and appending them to the page
[06:14:17] <jrajav> Inside a's
[06:14:23] <jrajav> I though that might have something to do with it
[06:14:27] <jrajav> But that would be weird
[06:14:33] <shoky> good luck getting help ;)
[06:14:44] <jrajav> Well you're certainly not much ;)
[06:14:55] <shoky> i wonder why
[06:20:55] <docmur> here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/Zaahy/9/  when you click action a button drop down should appear, the buttons in it causing the issue
[06:21:30] <seutje> jrajav: makes sense if the img element doesn't have any dimensions and u drop a random src string in there, it'll jump before loading in
[06:21:51] <jrajav> It will?
[06:21:56] <jrajav> But the element is hidden at this point
[06:22:01] <jrajav> I'd think it wouldn't affect the page at all
[06:22:09] <jrajav> In addition, it has absolute positioning
[06:22:14] <jrajav> So it shouldn't affect page flow
[06:22:22] <jrajav> I forgot to mention that this problem only appears in Opera, btw
[06:22:28] <jrajav> It works great on Chrome and FF
[06:22:50] <seutje> oh, sry, misread var name
[06:24:29] <alex88> hi guys, is there a plugin that let me scroll to an anchor less some pixels? because i've a transparent fixed navbar and clicking on a #div link makes the top of the div being behind the bar
[06:25:42] <pachet> do you need it to be all animated and fancy and stuff
[06:25:45] <pachet> or can it just jump
[06:29:26] <alex88> pachet: just jump to the correct position
[06:29:33] <jrajav> alex88: You can use window.scrollby https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Window.scrollBy
[06:30:42] <alex88> jrajav: but in that case i have to hook every link
[06:30:52] <alex88> i think it's easier if i add some padding to the body
[06:31:09] <jrajav> You said "scroll to an anchor", that implies you already have a specific anchor in mind?
[06:31:18] <jrajav> You want to do this for every link?
[06:31:45] <pachet> just uh
[06:31:48] <alex88> jrajav: every link, actually it's just href="#anchor"
[06:31:50] <pachet> put some padding-top on your anchor targets
[06:32:05] <alex88> pachet: yeah maybe with css is simplier
[06:32:09] <jrajav> >_>
[06:37:24] <jrajav> alex88: This is what I meant http://jsfiddle.net/UV44r/
[06:37:42] <cobalt237> I've noticed when I start a jquery ui accordion hidden and open it later, it's too small so nothing in its tabs are shown
[06:37:52] <cobalt237> Is there a way to make sure it's large enough when shown?
[06:37:59] <alex88> jrajav: i know, but i have about 50 links like that and i can't make a function for each one
[06:38:21] <jrajav> alex88: And what do you think you'd have to do with a plugin? :|
[06:38:59] <alex88> jrajav: in fact i asked, i know the scrollTo plugin, but it should be used that way, just asked for another solution
[06:39:02] <jrajav> Nothing's going to magically change how browsers handle anchor links, you need some sort of plugin or you need to change the elements on the page (which would be a lot MORE work), e.g. by making invisible anchors some distance above the real ones
[06:39:05] <alex88> but i'll go with css ;)
[06:39:29] <jrajav> alex88: Changing the padding will actually insert more space above the anchors though
[06:39:55] <alex88> jrajav: in fact i'm thinking to add some padding on the whole div or something similar
[06:41:03] <mms_> hi I get reply from service as {"range":[2,3,4]}.   now how to iterate over it ?
[06:41:18] <jrajav> alex88: Actually, changing the padding won't fix it
[06:41:27] <jrajav> alex88: http://jsfiddle.net/UV44r/1/
[06:41:32] <mms_> resp.range.each is not a function it complains
[06:43:23] <alex88> jrajav: it does http://jsfiddle.net/UV44r/2/
[06:44:12] <jrajav> alex88: My bad. I guess it doesn't work the same on <a> tag
[06:44:23] <jrajav> i.e. I set the style on a, not p
[06:44:27] <alex88> yeah that seems the problem
[06:44:37] <alex88> i think on div it will work
[06:45:38] <mms_> $.each(arr, fn) works
[06:46:40] <jrajav> mms_: Are you looking for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach?
[06:46:41] <alexr2> Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I'm trying to create a new instance of a class, but the name is generated dynamically.  IE: I have a class called function ABC() {}.   I want to do a: var new_inst = new ABC(), but the "ABC" is a dynamically generated string.   var name = "ABC"; var new_inst = new [name]()
[06:47:58] <beachandbytes> so a random class?
[06:48:04] <beachandbytes> random function
[06:48:49] <pachet> alexr2: just store the constructors in an object
[06:49:54] <alexr2> beachandbytes: Lets say I have 5 different classes... ABC1 -> ABC5... the name of the class I want to make an instance of is dynamically generated
[06:50:09] <pachet> var constructor_list = { ABC : function ( ) { ---> }, DEF : function ( ) { ----> } }, random_instance = new constructor_list [(Math.random()-0.5)?'ABC':'DEF']();
[06:50:51] <WebDragon> if you had var tabrow = $('.tabrow'); how would you write $('.tabrow li a').click() .. would you use a .find() or can you make compound statements inside the $() selector step ?
[06:51:10] <WebDragon> (coffee still hasn't sunk in yet, brain fuzzy still)
[06:51:15] <lathan> tabrow.find('li a').click()
[06:51:24] <lathan> WebDragon, or $('li a', tabrow).click()
[06:51:39] <lathan> WebDragon, but the .find is more logically linear....more clarity
[06:51:43] <WebDragon> oh? now that's one I hadn't seen before
[06:51:51] <lathan> jQueyr accepts a context as the 2nd argument
[06:51:59] <lathan> a "domain" in which to search by
[06:52:13] <docmur> Is there a short hand notation to set something like var flag = {one:, two:, three, four:} to one value
[06:52:17] <WebDragon> why does that ... aha, I see. I never really noticed that before (probably because I hadn't yet thought about this in this way)
[06:52:18] <lathan> its verry useful when working with multiple window documents
[06:52:27] <WebDragon> lathan: yes I can see how it would be
[06:52:39] <lathan> it defaults to "document"
[06:52:46] <WebDragon> yeah :D
[06:53:21] <pachet> docmur: not really
[06:53:37] <lathan> docmur, $.each(['one','two','three','four'], function(i,key){ flag[key] = "newvalue" });
[06:53:43] <pachet> ^
[06:53:45] <lathan> loop through the keys and set the new key value
[06:53:58] <docmur> meh there are only four, it's cleaner and easier then to set them each
[06:54:00] <WebDragon> set a random element of the array perhaps
[06:54:05] <lathan> docmur, not really shorthand...but ....yah
[06:54:05] <pachet> or just .map if you're foraying outside the safe walls of jquerlandia
[06:54:08] <lathan> docmur, correct

[06:54:58] <pachet> i didnt imply that
[06:55:07] <pachet> i was just saying that he didnt need jquery just for that
[06:55:09] <lathan> "pachet: or just .map if you're foraying outside the safe walls of jquerlandia"
[06:55:10] <lathan> oh
[06:55:22] <lathan> sounded like leaving jQuery....
[06:55:38] <pachet> blasphemy
[06:55:47] <lathan> amen

[06:55:53] <lathan> ?lolo
[06:56:07] <bot-t> lathan, Couldn't find "lolo" in jQuery Docs.
[06:57:30] <WebDragon> got a bit of an interesting puzzle that should be relatively simple for this mornings exercise. http://devel.phantomlab.com/products/catphan.php (compare it with the magphan.php page to see how the redesign is)
[06:58:15] <WebDragon> the top header portion will change text and bg image when tab is clicked (going to use html5 data-* attributes for this) and then load in the lower section each part. the tricky bit is that these are discontiguous areas
[06:58:28] <WebDragon> the tabs don't contain the content nor the header
[06:58:32] <WebDragon> just trigger points
[06:59:00] <WebDragon> wish me luck, I'm goin in :D
[07:00:16] <WebDragon> so far I got the tabs working in everything including IE7 (7-8 lose the rounded corners, 7 loses the center alignment and has some other previously undiscovered bugs due to how I was testing IE when we did this last)
[07:00:38] <WebDragon> thank god for xdissent's ievms script and microsoft putting them together

[07:29:46] <johnkpaul> haha
[07:29:56] <johnkpaul> too bad, googlefu you must learn
[07:29:56] <johnkpaul> ;)
[07:30:07] <seutje> firstclassfunc: note that this will most likely increase the performance hit of your query by a lot
[07:30:28] <seutje> johnkpaul: hey, don't be hatin' on my fu
[07:30:29] <firstclassfunc> seutje: that's ok, just testing for now, thanks
[07:30:54] <seutje> I use them attribute selectors to figure out where my backenders are dropping duplicate IDs
[07:36:08] <seutje> heh, jquery doesn't seem to like having dots in your IDs
[07:36:35] <seutje> ?eval $('[id=foo.bar]');
[07:36:41] <bot-t> seutje: No output. (Process Killed)
[07:38:53] <johnkpaul> seutje: you need to escape it
[07:38:57] <johnkpaul> with backslash
[07:39:25] <johnkpaul> sorry, two backslashes
[07:41:36] <bil`> How can I check if an event listener like this is already created $('criteria-plus-minus').on('click', 'a.criteria-add', addRow);
[07:42:39] <seutje> johnkpaul: or quote it
[07:42:51] <seutje> $('[id="lala.works.fine"]')
[07:43:47] <seutje> guess it works fine like that, qSA also errors when not escaping/quoting
[07:44:25] <pachet> bil`: $._data($('.criteria-plus-minus') [0], 'events')['click
[07:44:33] <pachet> *']
[07:44:39] <pachet> but i wouldn't rely on that ;[
[07:44:55] <pachet> just keep track of it yourself
[07:45:11] <pachet> if you're worried about assigning duplicate handlers, use .off first
[07:45:48] <bil`> does .click() create duplicate handers?
[07:46:17] <kroniksenvy> Im looking for a plugin that i could use to display data like so http://i45.tinypic.com/1rrot2.jpg  First collumn are categories, next products, next product info, I know this isnt a channel to disscuss plugins but i cant find anything by google and im hoping you guys might have an idea about a similar plugin
[07:46:46] <fuchstronaut> having a set of rows, var tr = $('table > tbody > tr');, how do I get td's from each row with an index ranging between 2 and 5 i.e. ?
[07:46:58] <pachet> you're just throwing functions into a list of callbacks that are called when that event is triggered
[07:47:01] <fuchstronaut> is there a selector to get these elements or do I have to loop?
[07:47:10] <pachet> so yeah, you can have multiple functions per event
[07:47:42] <pachet> in addition to using .off, i highly recommend namespacing your events
[07:48:08] <pachet> ?.slice @ fuchstronaut
[07:48:09] <bot-t> fuchstronaut, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[07:48:39] <fuchstronaut> I am asking for a selector as I dont want to loop each row and use slice
[07:49:59] <pachet> oh
[07:50:22] <pachet> $('tr:gt(2):lt(5)')
[07:50:50] <fuchstronaut> hm, that would slice the rows, not each rows children td ;)
[07:50:57] <fuchstronaut> guess ill have to use more than 1 selector
[07:51:35] <Alfie_> Hello everyone
[07:51:45] <pachet> oh, im just skimming, so you have to meet me halfway
[07:51:54] <pachet> $('tr td:gt(2):lt(5)')
[07:52:51] <fuchstronaut> nvm, I guess Im just trying to make it less complicated by complicating
[07:53:29] <Alfie_> Quick question I'm getting an empty object [], how do I check for it, I've tried with $.isEmptyObject but returns exactly the same thing when the object actually has something in it
[07:53:31] <Alfie_> any ideas?
[07:53:46] <johnkpaul> Alfie_: .length
[07:54:00] <johnkpaul> ?eval [].length;
[07:54:02] <bot-t> johnkpaul: 0
[07:54:05] <johnkpaul> ?eval [1].length
[07:54:06] <bot-t> johnkpaul: 1
[07:54:50] <Alfie_> johnkpaul, thanks that works :)
[07:54:57] <johnkpaul> np, Alfie_
[08:07:36] <regebro> Am I doing something wring in this ajax request? : http://pastebin.com/KcwSxmLJ
[08:07:55] <regebro> It works on Firefox and Chrome and IE9 (at least last time I tried) but not IE8.
[08:08:03] <regebro> It just sends empty data.
[08:16:50] <regebro> I did find some some discussion claiming that IE8 had problems with Ajax and persistent connections.
[08:17:07] <regebro> But that would only happen if you lost the connection, or something.
[08:17:26] <regebro> And I tried closing connections after each connection and that didn't seem to make any difference.
[08:17:35] <regebro> "didn't seem" it made no difference.
[08:18:15] <regebro> But when debugging this with 1.4.2 it does seem like the request times out before it's sent...
[08:20:07] <tw2113> get a current version of jquery
[08:20:49] <regebro> tw2113: This happens with all versions. 1.4.2 is the only one where I seem to be able to debug it.
[08:21:09] <regebro> With 1.8.2 the debugger just hangs when doing a "setp into" over the xhr.send() call.
[08:21:31] <regebro> step into, I mean.
[08:22:46] <regebro> Does maybe somebody have an example of an Jaxa POST request that they know workson IE8?
[08:23:09] <regebro> I still suspect I just do something stupidly silly wrong. timeoutNumber
[08:23:25] <regebro> http://pastebin.com/KcwSxmLJ
[08:24:36] <regebro> This is the first time I try to do Ajax with jQuery, I might have missed something. It's so simple I don't understand how come it doens't work.
[08:25:25] <NodeX> whats' the error
[08:26:00] <regebro> NodeX: No error, IE8 doesn't seem to send the Ajax data to the server.
[08:31:10] <ink_> regebro: your best bet is to put something on jsfiddle
[08:31:48] <ink_> i for one am shocked to hear that IE is misbehaving

[08:34:46] <green-_> i'd like to append multiple values onto an input field via jquery (an input field that would be named, for instance name="foo[]") .. but I can't find a reference. Anyone know how to do this?
[08:35:15] <eip56> morning n3rds
[08:37:17] <nchlssmith1> Can anyone tell me if this is a valid argument?                   if (!typeof childFV === 'undefined')
[08:39:19] <jrockjiggz> Hi, is there way to re-send an http request (including the post data) for quicker debugging?
[08:40:32] <nchlssmith1> jrockjiggz: like refresh the page?  What do you mean by re-send http request
[08:40:33] <nchlssmith1> ?
[08:43:33] <lathan> jrockjiggz, firebug for FF
[08:43:37] <jrockjiggz> nchlssmith1: yes, but since i'm in an ajax application, i cant just hit refresh
[08:43:46] <jrockjiggz> i'd have to re-fill the form out again and submit
[08:43:50] <lathan> jrockjiggz, the firebug net tab in the console
[08:44:16] <jrockjiggz> lathan: does it let you 're-fire' that exact xml request?
[08:44:21] <jrockjiggz> *xmlHttpRequest
[08:44:49] <jrockjiggz> because, i'd like to.. in chrome, just 're-send' the xmlHttpRequest and see the result
[08:45:42] <jrockjiggz> the is an XHR url, but i dont think it includes POST data
[08:46:03] <otineb> hi everyone. Pretty new to jquery and I'm doing some simple form validation and was wondering how to properly combine functions within a script. I don't have access to the way a form is built (or tagged) so I want to grab part of an input's id that seems to be consistent. I'm hoping the ":contains(text)" tag might be useful here.

[08:53:29] <ink_> loving it
[08:54:56] <ink_> because im a bit lazy, can you update the jsfiddle so i can run it
[08:54:59] <ink_> so its a proper test case
[08:55:29] <ink_> in spite of today hanging out in #jquery, it really dont use it much lol :p came in to ask a question myself and got sidetracked
[08:55:39] <ink_> i'm lookin into ur problem tho
[08:56:16] <ink_> i take it this is using the validate plugin/
[08:56:35] <otineb> @ink_ yep
[08:56:53] <ink_> if you cud paste a form in there, so i can test the validation
[08:56:56] <ink_> i'd be a big help
[08:56:58] <otineb> i'll add a field etc
[08:57:00] <otineb> standby
[08:58:11] <pifantastic> otineb: you'll always get the fastest help if you have a functioning jsfiddle that reproduces the problem
[08:58:22] <alexparker> $('selector').style('display','');  is setting display:none; rather than removing the display property from the inline styles. Is this a new change? or a bug?
[08:58:52] <otineb> @pifantastic Understood. Just now heard of jsfiddle. ITS AMAZING
[08:59:00] <otineb> @ink_ Updated: http://jsfiddle.net/QzeAk/1/
[08:59:03] <pifantastic> indeed
[08:59:08] <pifantastic> alexparker: is that the case in all browsers?
[08:59:20] <pifantastic> alexparker: because an empty string is not a valid CSS property
[08:59:43] <pifantastic> alexparker: plus, .hide() is much sexier
[09:00:03] <alexparker> haha yea
[09:00:06] <green-_> ink_: if I have <input name="foo[]" /> which by default has no values  â¦ I'd like to, via jquery, iteratively add values to that input field
[09:00:13] <alexparker> let me triple ch eck this
[09:00:25] <ink_> green-_:  that input fails validation
[09:00:31] <ink_> they require a type
[09:00:35] <otineb> @ink_ take that back. Use this one.http://jsfiddle.net/QzeAk/3/
[09:00:54] <ink_> and "add values to that input field" is a little confusing
[09:00:57] <ink_> pls try again
[09:00:57] <green-_> sorry, type = text
[09:01:58] <green-_> hmm, come to think of it, can you even do <input type="text" name="foo[]" /> or is the [] notation only valid on <select>
[09:02:04] <green-_> i think i'm being dumb
[09:02:19] <otineb> @ink_ Dude, just realized I have to link appropriate libraries to jsFiddle. Sorry, will provide updated link in a sec
[09:02:32] <pifantastic> green-_: is your backend PHP?
[09:02:40] <ink_> for(var i=0;i<5;i++) { var val = $('#idOfInput').val(); $('#idOfInput').val(val + i.toString()) }
[09:02:45] <ink_> green-_:  ^^
[09:02:59] <green-_> pifantastic: yes
[09:03:00] <ink_> that appends values
[09:03:14] <alexparker> pifantastic: it seems like .hide() has been updated to work slightly differently
[09:03:26] <alexparker> pifantastic: it doesn't simply add 'display:none'
[09:03:33] <ink_> i'd GUESS what you want to do
[09:04:01] <ink_> is create multiple input elements, each with a type and value and the name array[]
[09:04:31] <pifantastic> alexparker: yes, that's why .hide() is preferred, it works around any weirdnesses
[09:04:38] <ink_> and if you're using PHP you will find $_POST/GET['array'] == array containing the values
[09:04:47] <green-_> ink_: yes, and the input type would be hidden. I'm doing too many things at once. :)
[09:04:58] <alexparker> pifantastic: got it. Thanks! i was using .hide() then .css('display','') instead of show(), shame on me
[09:04:59] <ink_> or too few
[09:05:20] <ink_> but yes, use jquery to create lots of element with that name
[09:05:28] <ink_> and on submit PHP will interpret them as an array
[09:05:34] <ink_> and do what i said above
[09:05:55] <ink_> otineb: where's your latest jsfiddle, just to reiterate, what we need
[09:06:20] <otineb> @ink_ http://jsfiddle.net/QzeAk/4/
[09:06:25] <regebro> Nope, even rewrote the server as a WSGI server. Meh.
[09:06:51] <ink_> is something that when we click the run button will do something either correct or incorrect, the key here is it will do something
[09:07:05] <ink_> at present all yours does it throw an error on the bits that should be commented.
[09:07:31] <futz> Each time I try and do something w/ sliding, I get unexpected results. Proof of concept at http://rduval.dev.wellcomemat.com/poc/sliding.htm. The black box slides as expected (R to L), but the red box goes L to R, despite having direction 'left'. The red box ends up in the right place after the animation, but it doesn't slide in as black slides out, which is what I want. Am I doing something wrong?
[09:07:47] <ink_> we need a test case, so in your case we need to see ORIGINAL doing what its supposed to do, and MODIFIED fail to do what its supposed to do
[09:08:04] <ink_> otherwise on top of fixing ur error, we have to guess at what you're trying to achieve
[09:08:34] <otineb> @ink_ right, if you look at the form, there are two zip inputs with totally different names. In real life, these fields live on two different pages but the zip field ALWAYS contains the phrase "post code". I'm trying to get the modified code to search out the "post code" phrase id and then validate that field per validate() functions - specifically "digits:"
[09:09:00] <ink_> how will i know when it works?
[09:09:04] <danshtr> Hi All. How do I redirect from HTTP to HTTPS without knowing the hostname on which the code is running?
[09:09:09] <ink_> will i get an alert or something
[09:09:14] <otineb> @ink_ derp
[09:09:16] <otineb> my bad
[09:09:17] <ink_> so original works
[09:09:22] <otineb> standby one more time please
[09:09:23] <ink_> i assume
[09:09:24] <pjp> Hi, is there any jQuery example which shows how to process server response to a POST request?
[09:09:25] <ink_> but i cant see it
[09:09:26] <ink_> wait
[09:09:28] <otineb> ok
[09:09:38] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/QzeAk/6/
[09:09:42] <regebro> IE8 still refuses to send any data to my server. I guess I just need to give up on IE8 until somebody actually pays me two weeks of money to fix it. :-)
[09:10:38] <ink_> here
[09:10:38] <ink_> http://jsfiddle.net/QzeAk/8/
[09:10:41] <ink_> start with this
[09:10:44] <ink_> it's 100% error free
[09:10:59] <ink_> now you have to make the ORIGINAL code, do something to show us its working
[09:11:15] <ink_> once we've got the "working" actually working
[09:11:29] <ink_> we will be better equipped to get the broken code working
[09:11:32] <ink_> its an iterative process
[09:12:20] <otineb> @ink_ gotcha
[09:13:32] <ink_> i dont mean to be pedantic, its jsut ive never even seen this validate plugin before today
[09:13:41] <ink_> i'm only asking because i dont know how to do it myself
[09:15:03] <otineb> @ink_ I 100% understand. Let me get something working so you can see what's supposed to happen, then we'll expand. Might be a minute. Someone keeps calling me :/
[09:19:28] <black_warlock> hey peeps
[09:19:48] <abletony84> hey
[09:19:51] <abletony84> I got this "hover thumbnails to display photos" thing at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/wBSy4/ - but how do I get it to work for multiple "photos" divs?
[09:20:45] <black_warlock> b ut it works
[09:20:50] <black_warlock> already
[09:21:05] <abletony84> ah wait
[09:21:12] <abletony84> my sentence is lacking something crucial
[09:22:42] <abletony84> I got this "hover thumbnails to display photos" thing at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/wBSy4/ - but how come it fails with multiple photos divs: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/wBSy4/1/ ?
[09:24:23] <black_warlock> its stil working
[09:24:26] <black_warlock> lol
[09:25:02] <black_warlock> what do you expect it does ?
[09:25:14] <black_warlock> when i pass over pictures they are being shown on box
[09:25:50] <Solet> whats the quickest way to add some text to theend of $('#myelement'), in straight js you'd just do innerHTML+=, is there a mechanic for this in jquery?
[09:26:55] <black_warlock> .text()
[09:27:30] <abletony84> black_warlock: over here the 2nd fiddle won't display all the big photos, only the first
[09:27:34] <pifantastic> Solet: $('#myelement').text($('#myelement').text() + ' whatever');
[09:27:45] <black_warlock> man for me its is working lol
[09:27:56] <pifantastic> Solet: but better to do var el = $('#myelement'); el.text(el.text() + ' whatever');
[09:28:10] <abletony84> black_warlock: at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/wBSy4/1/ you dont see like 10 thumbnails?
[09:28:14] <Solet> that functions the same as .html() would
[09:28:24] <black_warlock> yes
[09:28:28] <pifantastic> Solet: .text() and .html() are very different
[09:28:28] <black_warlock> i see 10 thumbnails
[09:28:42] <abletony84> black_warlock: and only 1 big photo right?
[09:28:45] <black_warlock> and when i pass on each it display the relative thumb
[09:28:50] <black_warlock> ye
[09:28:54] <black_warlock> 1 big photo
[09:28:57] <syborg> Solet: be careful with .text() it will replace all of the html. You might want to check out append()
[09:29:01] <syborg> http://api.jquery.com/append/
[09:29:09] <pifantastic> Solet: you can also append a new element. $('#myelement').append('TEXT NODE');
[09:29:16] <abletony84> black_warlock: yup, then in the html you can see each .op-photo is suppose to show one big photo
[09:29:31] <abletony84> so theres like 1 big photo for every 3 of those thumbnails
[09:29:40] <abletony84> theres suppose to be i mean
[09:30:23] <Solet> ok so just $('#here').append(document.createTextNode('blah'))
[09:31:26] <black_warlock> the other photos are being shown in the same big box
[09:31:35] <black_warlock> when you pass hover
[09:32:42] <black_warlock> what browser are you using ?
[09:32:52] <black_warlock> what browser are you using ? abletony84
[09:32:57] <pjp> Hello, could someone help me to receive server response using qQuery? (I can see the server response in firebug, but don't know how to process it JS)
[09:33:18] <black_warlock> console()
[09:33:24] <pjp> s/qQuery/jQuery
[09:33:46] <wachpwnski> pjp there should be a callback
[09:34:06] <pjp> wachpwnski: yeah, I tried it but does not seem to work,
[09:34:13] <wachpwnski> Let's se your code
[09:34:33] <wachpwnski> What kind of response are you looking for?
[09:34:45] <wachpwnski> Good or bad, or something more specific?
[09:34:51] <pjp> wachpwnski: I tried this -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10475652/jquery-post-processing-json-response
[09:35:20] <abletony84> black_warlock: hello im using firefox
[09:35:42] <pjp> wachpwnski: http://pjp.fedorapeople.org/comnt.html
[09:36:25] <black_warlock> abletony84 i see images changing also in FF
[09:36:37] <black_warlock> when i pass over miniatures
[09:36:47] <pjp> wachpwnski: I'm trying to learn with a simple app which submits a comment to the server and the same is retrieved from the server to display in the text area
[09:37:17] <Aamir> better way of doing this:        $pagination.find( 'a.disabled' ).closest('li').next('li a') ??
[09:37:20] <wachpwnski> pjp, your script doesn't have a call back.
[09:37:41] <abletony84> black_warlock: yeah they're suppose to do that :)
[09:37:58] <black_warlock> and you dont see them ?
[09:38:04] <pjp> wachpwnski: yeah, I've been trying different things, I removed it, I tried the from earlier link, did not work,
[09:38:13] <black_warlock> why dont you put miniatures inline ?
[09:38:26] <BillCriswell> Aamir: Looks ok to me.
[09:38:46] <wachpwnski> pjp, plus your http://pjp.fedorapeople.org/test.cgi is not giving a response but direct access to your code.
[09:38:48] <Aamir> well it should be       $pagination.find( 'a.disabled' ).closest('li').next('li').find('a')
[09:39:08] <Aamir> BillCriswell:  its ok but a lot of DOM navigation :P
[09:39:31] <abletony84> black_warlock: i do i just didnt include the css. the problem is that my jquery code is only written for one instance of .photos, when there are multiple .photos, the all big images except for the first instance of .photos fail to show.
[09:40:04] <pjp> wachpwnski: yes, it does not support CGI, I just uploaded there to share,
[09:40:40] <pjp> wachpwnski: I've it working on my machine, I see the server response in firebug, but can't fetch it in JS
[09:41:03] <denver> Hi. I keep getting the following issue on my website: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined jquery-ui-1.9.0.custom.min.js:6
[09:42:53] <wachpwnski> pjp: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ check out those examples at the bottom.
[09:43:05] * pjp clicks
[09:44:04] <wachpwnski> You probably want to use success: function(data) { handling codeâ¦ } or $.ajax().done()
[09:44:51] <wachpwnski> $,ajax().done( function(data) { handling codeâ¦ });  ***
[09:45:14] <pjp> wachpwnski: I see, let me try,
[09:46:30] <black_warlock> i dont get you
[09:47:25] <black_warlock> you want for each pack 1 big photo and minitures under it ?
[09:48:20] <pjp> wachpwnski: how do I add data to the $.ajax() POST request? (it does POST, right?)
[09:48:23] <black_warlock> ok jsfiddle its breaking down ! wont save anymore
[09:52:10] <black_warlock> aff
[09:52:17] <black_warlock> i hate when ppl dc
[09:52:37] <pjp> wachpwnski: no luch, server returns 200 with the json response, but the $.ajax().done(function(){...}) does not see it,
[09:52:47] <pjp> wachpwnski: s/luch/luck
[09:53:29] <goddard> how is jquery accordion nesting ?
[09:53:37] <wachpwnski> pjp try $.ajax( success: function(data) {} );
[09:53:44] <goddard> any built in features?
[09:54:52] <regebro> pjp: "Add data"? I send the data in the data: key.
[09:55:06] <regebro> That works, except on IE8, for some reason. And only for me.
[09:56:34] <pjp> regebro: yep, it worked, but still success: function(data){ alert(data); } does not alert anything,
[09:56:37] <pjp> wachpwnski: ^^
[09:57:08] <denver> Hi. I keep getting the following issue on my website: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined jquery-ui-1.9.0.custom.js:332
[09:57:34] <STyler> Denver did you include the jquery library?
[09:57:39] <denver> Yes
[09:57:46] <regebro> pjp: stange.
[09:57:58] <pjp> regebro: yeah, very weird
[09:58:50] <STyler> Denver what about the jquery ui?
[09:58:59] <STyler> There should be two libraries you are including if using UI stuff
[09:59:07] <denver> Oh. My bad. I had type="text/jvascript" src="jquery-1.8.2.js"
[09:59:14] <STyler> haha
[09:59:16] <STyler> It happens  ;)
[09:59:29] <denver> thanks STyler anyway :)
[09:59:36] <STyler> No prob
[09:59:37] <regebro> pjp: I have this: success: function (data, status, jqXHR) {...}
[09:59:58] <regebro> That works for me, and the JSON data is in data.
[10:00:08] <pjp> regebro: http://pastebin.com/v90tYud3
[10:00:15] <Nancy2012> I am using query tab UI library for tabing system,â¦ only problem is thatâ¦ i want to show tabs on the browser Url too
[10:00:28] * pjp tries,
[10:00:34] <goddard> how is jquery accordion nesting ?
[10:01:32] <regebro> pjp: Do you have a nice test.cgi for json? I'd like to test with Apache to verify that it's not my server that is broken for my weird IE8 issue.
[10:02:16] <pjp> regebro: sure, try -> http://pjp.fedorapeople.org/comnt.html
[10:02:18] * regebro doesn't know why he is still wasting time on getting this to work on IE8 just because somebody asked me.
[10:02:20] <blendedbychris> Hey guysâ¦ i'm trying to change the name value of an attribute using regex
[10:02:54] <blendedbychris> I have name="providers[sample_provider][value]" â¦ and i just want to change the [sample_provider] portion to [foo_provider]
[10:03:20] <pjp> regebro: it's a simple app to submit a comment to the server and the same is retrieved from the server using jQuery, comment is stored in a file on the server,
[10:06:38] <pjp> regebro: even status, jqXHR does not help,
[10:06:53] <black_warlock> guys who can help me with this fiddle
[10:07:01] <black_warlock> i need to alert the rel=""
[10:07:08] <black_warlock> on update
[10:07:17] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xyRrF/69/
[10:07:29] <regebro> pjp: Do you have the actual cgi script? I can't debug this, I have no idea if the server get's anything or not. :-)
[10:08:05] <pjp> regebro: he..he..yeah, the actual CGI script comes in the server response,
[10:08:20] <pjp> regebro: http://pjp.fedorapeople.org/test.cgi
[10:08:33] <regebro> pjp: Thanks!
[10:16:16] <regebro> pjp: Well, when I try that on the server I get a 101 Network error... :-)
[10:18:34] <pjp> regebro: oh, that's not because of the CGI, do other pages work properly?
[10:19:06] <regebro> pjp: I can load them, yes.
[10:19:19] <blendedbychris> If I am trying to replace the first key value "sample_provider" in the following string should I be using serialize instead of actually replacing the name attribute literally? providers[sample_provider][short_name]
[10:19:44] <regebro> But when I call that script via ajax that's the error I get back. Not sure why, possibly cross-site-request protection?
[10:19:46] <pjp> regebro: are those pages served by CGI ?
[10:19:54] <regebro> pjp: No.
[10:20:09] <pjp> regebro: hmmn,
[10:20:30] <regebro> So possibly that's the error you have as well?
[10:20:47] <regebro> success() doesn't get called, because it is in fact not a success.  :-)
[10:21:19] <black_warlock> zzzz nobody gud with sortable items ?
[10:23:29] <regebro> pjp: Ah, when I look more carefully in the console, then yes. 403 (Forbidden) Origin http://localhost:8001 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[10:23:33] <regebro> I need to run it locally.
[10:23:54] <pjp> regebro: yep,
[10:24:33] <pjp> regebro: I'm trying it on localhost,
[10:24:52] <pjp> regebro: no external resources,
[10:25:20] <regebro> Right. Trying to set up CGI and stuff here.
[10:28:01] <Nancy2012>  hello allâ¦ my problem is quite littleâ¦ actuallyâ¦ i am using jquery tabs UI library for tabing systemâ¦ and on some tabs have a iframe pop up â¦ but i don't know â¦what wrong with script.. because whenever i submit the value of the iframe pop up.. my iframe pop up  wouldn't close.. only if i have the URL looks www.example.com/rooms#tab3
[10:28:41] <pjp> regebro: ok, let me know if you face any issues,
[10:28:48] <Nancy2012> this is code for closing the tab and refreash the parent tab
[10:28:50] <Nancy2012> <script type='text/javascript'>window.close();window.top.location.href = window.top.location.href;</script>
[10:28:59] <ndboost> anyone have any idea how to trigger a tab event via jquery?
[10:29:02] <ndboost> or javascript
[10:29:17] <Nancy2012> it works whenever i use like thisâ¦ www.example.com/rooms
[10:29:22] <ndboost> this web app that i work with every day when you manually ype a value into a textbox and hit tab, itll add it
[10:29:35] <kristofers> I can't seem to figure out which one to use to stop animation spam
[10:29:40] <ndboost> i wrote some jquery to fill in values for me, but i need it to trigger a tab event so that it actually populates the value.
[10:29:54] <kristofers> i mean if you hover a div 3 4 times very quick the animation just go on and on until it goes through each event
[10:29:57] <Nancy2012> so whenever my parent url has "#tab3" it wouldn't work
[10:30:11] <Nancy2012> any idea guys?
[10:30:51] <Nancy2012> i want to refresh the page once i submit the iframe pop up values.. therefore i am using this following script
[10:30:52] <Nancy2012> <script type='text/javascript'>window.close();window.top.location.href = window.top.location.href;</script>
[10:30:54] <Brodingo> kristofers the queue is stacking up, in animation options set queue to false
[10:35:48] <kristofers> I just get this
[10:35:49] <kristofers>  jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[10:35:57] <kristofers> when i put the queue to false
[10:36:34] <pjp> regebro: wachpwnski I tried this simple example - http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_ajax2, replacing test.txt with /cgi-bin/test.cgi ...
[10:37:05] <pjp> regebro: wachpwnski still no luck, I guess there is some issue with the server response,
[10:39:12] <wachpwnski> pjp: most likely the issue, did you try a curl call?
[10:39:29] <pjp> wachpwnski: nope,
[10:41:07] <wachpwnski> Try doing a curl call and see what response you get
[10:43:27] <pjp> ===
[10:43:29] <pjp> $ curl -d '{"ctext": "hello, world"}' -A 'curl-7.24.0' http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/test.cgi
[10:43:29] <pjp> {'host': 127.0.0.1, 'agent': curl-7.24.0, 'request': POST}
[10:43:31] <pjp> ===
[10:43:35] <pjp> wachpwnski: ^^
[10:45:20] <wachpwnski> that is not proper json
[10:45:54] <wachpwnski> That is why you aren't getting a response.
[10:46:23] <wachpwnski> put an error handler in there and you will see
[10:47:17] <pjp> wachpwnski: error handler, where?
[10:47:37] <wachpwnski> Not neccessary.
[10:47:42] <wachpwnski> you should return json like this:
[10:47:58] <wachpwnski> {'host': '127.0.0.1', 'agent': 'curl-7.24.0', 'request': 'POST'}
[10:48:07] <regebro> pjp: Can't get even Chrome to post data to the CGI sript. Giving up. :-)
[10:48:21] <pjp> regebro: heh..
[10:48:23] <pjp> :)
[10:48:53] <wachpwnski> regebro: it's becuase it's perl, pjp needs to learn to python
[10:49:04] <regebro> Heh. :-)
[10:49:29] <regebro> wachpwnski: So with Perl we can't return data and with Python we cant retrieve it. :-P
[10:50:25] <pjp> wachpwnski: heh..I know python, :)
[10:50:41] <pjp> ===
[10:50:42] <pjp> $ curl -d '{"ctext": "hello, world"}' -A 'curl-7.24.0' http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/test.cgi
[10:50:42] <pjp> {'host': "127.0.0.1", 'agent': "curl-7.24.0", 'request': "POST"}
[10:50:43] <pjp> ===
[10:50:47] <pjp> wachpwnski: regebro ^^
[10:50:58] <wachpwnski> yah, now you are getting proper json
[10:51:14] <wachpwnski> now lets try something like this
[10:51:14] <regebro> pjp: That ctext doesn't end up in the comment file.
[10:51:19] <pjp> wachpwnski: still, can't see it in jQuery,
[10:51:31] <pjp> regebro: it does,
[10:51:59] <regebro> pjp: OK, not for me.
[10:52:51] <pjp> regebro: not with curl, it needs to go as a form parameter,
[10:53:03] <pjp> wachpwnski: ?
[10:53:48] <wachpwnski> let me post some code
[10:54:34] <regebro> pjp: Well, it doesnât do it with jquery either for me. That means I'm either close to some enlightenment or barking up the wrong tree. :-)
[10:55:07] <pjp> regebro: he..he..did you see httpd error_file ?:)
[10:55:45] <BillCriswell> I have the harder time remembering I can use attribute selectors in my CSS now since I don't have to worry about IE6.
[10:55:48] <pjp> regebro: also, apache needs to have permissions to create comments file
[10:55:49] <BillCriswell> hardest*
[10:56:02] <regebro> pjp: YEah, but I didn't look carefully, as I hate Perl. :-)
[10:56:10] <BillCriswell> That browser put in place the worst mental block.
[10:56:25] <pjp> regebro: heh...hmmn, np, :)
[10:57:00] <regebro> pjp: Indeed, it says $cmt is undefined, and interpreted as an empty string. Which is what happens.
[10:58:38] <doughj3> Trying to use .on() to add an event handler for elements that are dynamically added. Wondering why this works: `$(document).on('click', '#myid-'+idvar, function(event){...})`  but this does not: `$('#myid-'+idvar).on('click', function(event){...}`
[10:58:46] <pjp> regebro: in save_comment() ?
[10:58:51] <regebro> Yes.
[10:59:01] <regebro> Not that I understand how it can be undefined, though. But since this means I can't use this script to see if any data was posted, I'll have to do something else.
[10:59:16] <regebro> Maybe install Apache wsgi? I can try that.
[10:59:23] <wachpwnski> pjp:  http://jsfiddle.net/VbhgP/  try something like that
[10:59:27] <doughj3> http://pastebin.com/8Qs166kN  little cleaner
[10:59:32] <doughj3> Why is that?
[10:59:37] * pjp clicks
[11:00:25] <pjp> regebro: no-no, that function is called from #main, where the parameter is passed to save_comment,
[11:00:46] <regebro> pjp: Yeees?
[11:00:48] <pjp> regebro: try to invoke test.cgi from the comnt.html, it has a form to submit
[11:01:03] <pjp> regebro: $cmt value,
[11:01:28] <pjp> regebro: plus, apache needs permissions to create comments file,
[11:02:01] <kristofers> http://www.dizzain.com/ I'm trying to figure out what has been used to give the shadow that slow changing in opacity i know what's being done there is changing the opacity and the height on hover
[11:02:10] <regebro> pjp: The file is there, and being written to. But $cmt is undefined when written.
[11:02:25] <regebro> It's not *me* saying it's undefined. It's Perl, via the Apache logs.
[11:02:38] <kristofers> But i've managed to replicated it exactly but when mine changes height it does it so fast and is not nice
[11:02:56] <pjp> regebro: yes, true, so even when you submit comment from browser it shows undefined?
[11:02:56] <regebro> You know http://pjp.fedorapeople.org/comnt.html doesn't actually seem to do anything right? :-)
[11:02:57] <jholloman> anyone have an issue when upgrading from jQueryUI 1.8.x to 1.9.0 where separate accordion fields now stack on top of each other?
[11:03:10] <pjp> regebro: nope, that server does not support CGI,
[11:03:17] <regebro> Trying.
[11:04:14] <TelFiRE> Ok. jQuery logic question. Let's say I set a var... var curpage = $('fieldset.cur_page');    then I use curpage.toggleClass('cur_page').nextAll('fieldset.step').addClass('cur_page').   Now if I use curpage again, does it still refer to the original curpage or does it switch to the new one? Or does it just not work
[11:04:55] <regebro> As far as I can tell, nothing happens when I push the submit button.
[11:05:16] <regebro> pjp: I feel like this is yak-shaving. Sorry, I'm going to stop now.
[11:05:39] <pjp> regebro: heh...ok, :)
[11:05:40] <jholloman> TelFiRE: it will still refer to the original
[11:05:55] <jholloman> as long as you dont do curpage = curpage.ToggleClass('cur_page')...
[11:06:11] <pjp> wachpwnski: yep, I get there was an error with this request
[11:06:35] <TelFiRE> jholloman gotcha. So is there a way to optimize it or should I just use another jquery wrap?
[11:07:10] <jholloman> you can just make a new variable if you want
[11:07:24] <pjp> wachpwnski: how/where do I see the error?
[11:07:25] <jholloman> so something like var newVar = curpage.toggleClass('cur_page').nextAll...
[11:09:56] <wachpwnski> pjp: It seems you are dealing with something that is major messed up. haha
[11:10:13] <pjp> wachpwnski: heh...yeah,
[11:10:27] <wachpwnski> well for one take out the 'json' and change that to 'html'
[11:10:30] * pjp can't figure out what's worng,
[11:10:37] <Nancy2012> anyone uses jquerytab UI
[11:10:39] <TelFiRE> If anyone has the time would they mind checking http://jsbin.com/exubof/1/edit and seeing if I'm making any major performance mistakes? It just seems like it should be performing better
[11:10:42] <Nancy2012> ?
[11:10:45] <wachpwnski> I am betting you are not setting your httpheaders in perl to return application/json
[11:10:58] <wachpwnski> and see if that helps
[11:11:20] <wachpwnski> dataType: 'json', â>  dataType: 'html',
[11:15:20] <pjp> wachpwnski: no, I'm setting headers to application/json, http://pjp.fedorapeople.org/test.cgi
[11:15:54] <computer2000> yo is there any masonry.js/isotope.js alternative? both are 90% what i need, but not 100%
[11:16:13] <wachpwnski> and you put it to valid json? pjp?
[11:16:31] <pjp> wachpwnski: valid json?
[11:17:35] <wachpwnski> { 'host' : '127.0.0.1' }
[11:17:39] <wachpwnski> type of thing
[11:18:58] <pjp> wachpwnski: yep,
[11:29:45] <rking> Am I missing something or do you really have to have a plugin to parse query strings?
[11:29:54] <rking> http://www.darlesson.com/jquery/querystring/
[11:30:58] <rking> I would have thought that would be basic API on window.*
[11:32:47] <jholloman> do accordions no longer auto resize their parent div for open/close?
[11:32:51] <doughj3> http://pastebin.com/8Qs166kN   What's the deal here?
[11:32:59] <jholloman> in jquery ui 1.9.0 vs 1.8.x
[11:37:01] <eddiemonge> doughj3: is myid-'+idvar added dynamically?
[11:37:04] <TelFiRE> I have made some optimizations and improved it a bit, but I feel still that this should be performing better. Relevant JS: http://jsbin.com/exubof/1/edit  Live: http://uncorkhope.cpstest1.info/node/add/auction-event
[11:37:17] <doughj3> eddiemonge: idvar is dynamic, this is all within a $.each()
[11:37:22] <WebDragon> if I have var anchor = $(this).attr('href'); where the href is a named anchor to an element's ID, how do I specify that so that I can do $(anchor).addClass('active') ? that doesn't seem to work
[11:37:29] <doughj3> Which is why I'm using .on and not just .click or something
[11:37:44] <TelFiRE> click just points to on
[11:37:48] * WebDragon starts another pot of DragonCoffeeâ¢ as he seems to need it
[11:37:53] <TelFiRE> oh nvm
[11:37:58] <TelFiRE> sry thought you were asking not stating
[11:38:29] <rking> I guess this is it. http://www.mathias-bank.de/jQuery/jquery.getUrlParam.js
[11:38:39] <TelFiRE> Oops that js was old http://jsbin.com/exubof/2/edit
[11:39:00] <WebDragon> $('[id=' + anchor +']') ? (and of course I'd need to regex out the #)
[11:39:04] <WebDragon> would that work?
[11:39:16] <WebDragon> or is there a better way
[11:40:49] <Nancy2012> i am using jquery tab UI
[11:40:52] <Nancy2012>    var $tabs = $( "#tabs" ).tabs({	cookie: {expires: 1}
[11:41:03] <WebDragon> maybe content.find(anchor)
[11:41:07] <gabrieluk> if i have <script>code</script> before </body>, is it normal that it "disappear" when inspecting the DOM, although everything works s expected?
[11:41:12] <Nancy2012> i want to delete the cookie once i go to another tab
[11:41:18] <Nancy2012> is ti possible?
[11:41:21] <Nancy2012> please let me know
[11:41:24] <Nancy2012> help me please
[11:41:53] <blendedbychris> Hey guys how can I change an input key value via attr (or maybe by serialize even).
[11:42:16] <blendedbychris> for instance I have foo[bar][baz] how can I change [bar] to [rar] or something
[11:43:34] <Nancy2012> here is my problem

[11:44:00] <Nancy2012> i am using query tab UI
[11:44:03] <Nancy2012> any idea guys?
[11:44:12] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com Anybody understand why my slider doesnt work?
[11:44:19] <djsounds02> no errors :(
[11:48:49] <djsounds02> ANYBODY?
[11:48:50] <djsounds02> oops
[11:53:12] <shoky> djsounds02: what slider
[11:53:17] <WebDragon> bloody hell, no matter what I do it's not adding the class 'active' to the element to unhide the specific id targeted
[11:53:31] <WebDragon> it's gotta be a thinko on my part but WHAT
[11:53:35] <WebDragon> argh
[11:53:53] <WebDragon> braaiiinnnssssss.. more braaaiiinnnsss
[11:54:04] <Kcko> :p
[11:54:12] <razzi> webdragon, the element with id is hidden by css?
[11:54:58] <WebDragon> razzi: http://devel.phantomlab.com/products/catphan.php (this doesn't have the code in it to show/hide the different content areas when you click the tabs in the middle, yet
[11:55:22] <WebDragon> razzi: but you can see the #Mainbody.products .maincontent article.active in the markup
[11:55:51] <WebDragon> and content.find(anchor).... works elsewhere in the code to obtain data to manipulate the header with
[11:55:51] <hlve> I'm sure I'm doing this in a very redundant way.. but it's not working. http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/j5pa5/ (On the actual website, when it loads, it loads the first 'Service User 1' set of form items.) When you click the add another service user, it creates another set of row items. I'm trying to make it so each service user box is wrapped in a div (with a class of fieldContainer) but for some
[11:55:52] <hlve> reason it's wrapping the entire box.
[11:55:54] <hlve> Bleh
[11:55:57] <hlve> Shoky. Save me.
[11:55:58] <hlve> :(
[11:56:08] <WebDragon> so I dunno why its not also allowing me to add the active class to the article with named ID
[11:56:29] <shoky> djsounds02: the jquery UI slider seems to work fine, and if you meant the slideshow.. i dont think you're including jquery cycle plugin
[12:00:03] <razzi> WebDragon, maybe it has something to do with #Mainbody.products .maincontent article header being hidden too
[12:00:18] <WebDragon> shouldn't
[12:00:51] <shoky> hlve: you're wrapping a <tr> with a <div>  ..?
[12:00:54] <razzi> it should, since the <p> is inside the header
[12:01:11] <eddiemonge> doughj3: i meant is that element created dynamically because your call is delegating the handler
[12:01:41] <hlve> shoky, that was my attempt at trying to do what I'm trying to accomplish
[12:01:43] <hlve> I need to wrap
[12:01:56] <hlve> one sec.
[12:02:18] <shoky> and why aren't you using jquery for all that stuff :\
[12:02:24] <hlve> I didn't code this
[12:02:31] <hlve> It's my bosses code.
[12:02:38] <WebDragon> razzi: but the articles are wrapping that.
[12:02:41] <hlve> I'm just adding to it. and rewriting it, I wouldn't even know where to start.
[12:03:25] <shoky> well, it wraps a <div> around a <tr>  so that is wrong ..
[12:03:27] <razzi> WebDragon, so what?
[12:03:59] <Nancy2012> here is my problem
[12:03:59] <Nancy2012>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5015880/onclick-delete-jquery-ui-tabs-cookie
[12:04:01] <Nancy2012> i want to delete the tab cookie value once i go to another tab
[12:04:02] <Nancy2012> i am using query tab UI
[12:04:02] <Nancy2012> any idea guys?
[12:04:21] <WebDragon> razzi: well if I click another tab, the content disappears, but if I click back to main, the main content RE appears, and the header within each article remains irrelevant
[12:04:30] <NoiseEee> Nancy2012: what code do you have now?
[12:04:46] <hlve> shoky, I know. My goal is to wrap the TR TD in a div.
[12:05:10] <razzi> WebDragon, there's only a an invisible <header> inside the <article>, so if you make the <article> visible nothing is seen
[12:05:11] <WebDragon> oh bloody hell
[12:05:14] <djsounds02> shoky: there is a slider at the top?
[12:05:15] <WebDragon> I know what the problem is
[12:05:21] <WebDragon> told you I needed more coffee
[12:05:23] <Nancy2012> NoiseEee: I just adding this line of codeâ¦
[12:05:24] <Nancy2012> var $tabs = $( "#tabs" ).tabs({	cookie: {expires: 1}
[12:05:35] <shoky> djsounds02: "the top" ?
[12:05:44] <WebDragon> razzi: exactly. duh. I forgot to pad the sections with lorem ipsum
[12:05:45] <shoky> djsounds02: slideshow? or jquery UI slider?
[12:05:47] <Nancy2012> but i want to delete the cookies if i go to another tab
[12:05:49] * WebDragon facepalms
[12:05:56] <hlve> shoky: So for example, it should output: <tr class="serviceUser"><td> <div class="fieldContainer"> <label>Name (first and last)</label></td><td><input id="UserName1" name="UserName1" style="width:300px; margin-left:-5px"></td> </div> </tr>
[12:05:57] <shoky> djsounds02: you're not including cycle
[12:06:00] <Nancy2012> becayuse ihave a i frame pop
[12:06:03] <Nancy2012> up
[12:06:20] * WebDragon guzzles DragonCoffeeâ¢ and climbs back under the hood
[12:06:22] <Nancy2012> orâ¦
[12:06:30] <NoiseEee> Nancy2012: sorry no idea, don't use jqueryui
[12:06:40] <shoky> hlve: the first 2 lines in AddServiceUserHTMLAndSetFocus function are wrapping a <div> around a <tr>.
[12:06:51] <hlve> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/j5pa5/1/
[12:06:58] <hlve> I removed my addition to his code.
[12:06:59] <WebDragon> razzi: sorry if I misunderstood what you meant because I'd forgotten to pad the content areas. *eyerolls* apologies :)
[12:07:14] <WebDragon> I didn't _intend_ to be this obtuse
[12:07:16] <hlve> I don't know how to wrap the TR TD's in the DIV.
[12:07:16] <WebDragon> heh
[12:07:33] <razzi> WebDragon, np, i wish i could communicate as well as coffee
[12:07:39] <WebDragon> ROFL
[12:11:56] <djsounds02> shoky: thanks
[12:14:38] <shoky> hlve: what you wrote doesn't make sense..  you opened the <div> in the first <td> but didn't close it
[12:15:02] <fusion27> I've rolled my own MVC in the past with jQuery and I took bad notes.  https://gist.github.com/3901322
[12:15:18] <fusion27> for view.js #5 I'm getting Window
[12:16:14] <fusion27> I'm trying to get model #13 in to view #5
[12:16:37] <fusion27> I'm having a retarded moment
[12:17:02] <hlve> Shoky, I think I'm explaining it poorly.
[12:17:05] <fusion27> I know I want to call a callback with my controller
[12:17:05] <hlve> Excuse my retard moment
[12:17:40] <shoky> hlve: proper html would be a good start ;p
[12:20:24] <hlve> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/j5pa5/1/ That currently is proper html, no?
[12:20:56] <shoky> hlve:  i need to know what it is that you wanna do.. and so far your only example was invalid
[12:21:07] <hlve> lol. Ah.
[12:22:23] <hlve> basically, when you click the button, it creates the label / input boxes.
[12:22:26] <hlve> <tr class="serviceUser"><td><label>Name (first and last)</label></td><td><input id="UserName1" name="UserName1" style="width:300px; margin-left:-5px"></td></tr>
[12:22:26] <hlve> <tr class="serviceUser"><td><label>Email</label></td><td><input id="UserEmail1" name="UserEmail1" style="width:300px; margin-left:-5px"></td></tr>
[12:22:27] <hlve> etc
[12:22:36] <shoky> i can see what it's currently doing..
[12:22:42] <starsinmypockets> What is the jQuery 1.3.2 version of $.ajax.(...).done(...) ?
[12:22:58] <hlve> I need to make it so it does:
[12:22:58] <hlve> <tr class="serviceUser"><div class="fieldContainer"><td><label>Name (first and last)</label></td><td><input id="UserName1" name="UserName1" style="width:300px; margin-left:-5px"></td></div></tr>
[12:22:58] <shoky> starsinmypockets: 1.5 i think
[12:23:06] <shoky> hlve: that is invalid
[12:23:13] <shoky> hlve: you can't have a <div> as a child of a <tr>
[12:23:28] <hlve> Will it not let you? Or is it just invalid?
[12:23:29] <hlve> lol
[12:23:45] <shoky> it's invalid and so we're not gonna talk about if it lets you or not
[12:23:58] <starsinmypockets> hlve - I guess I need to use success: paramater in 1.3.2
[12:24:12] <hlve> lol
[12:24:14] <SP33D> any one in here knows a Channel on freenode for asking questions about tcp/ip?
[12:24:26] <hlve> What about doing something like:
[12:24:36] <razzi> SP33D, maybe #programming
[12:24:50] <shoky> hlve: why do you want that <div> around the <td>s?  the <tr> is already an element wrapping the <td>s
[12:24:59] <starsinmypockets> Another question, I'm loading a form into a modal via ajax - I need jquery to be available inside the modal to load a gmap - is this possible?
[12:25:09] <hlve> shoky, basically, you see how the form below is setup right?
[12:25:28] <dominikd> i have some <script src="bla"> in my page can i get the contents of that script with jquery other than .contents(.attr('src'), callback)?
[12:25:29] <shoky> hlve: i've seen your fiddle, yes
[12:25:53] <NoiseEee> hlve: valid html, it's not that hard to understand if you take the time
[12:26:11] <hlve> I'm having trouble explaining what I need this to do, I think
[12:26:11] <starsinmypockets> http://maverickjetpants.com/ click drop point on map
[12:26:13] <hlve> :|
[12:26:20] <shoky> indeed you are
[12:26:30] <shoky> basically what you're saying is
[12:26:34] <shoky> " i wanna do something invalid"
[12:26:37] <hlve> No no.
[12:26:46] <shoky> so far, yes yes
[12:27:09] <dominikd> i have some <script src="bla"> in my page can i get the contents of that script with jquery other than .contents(.attr('src'), callback)?
[12:28:06] <hlve> You see how the form below has the label and input within the same TD DIV.fieldContainer?
[12:28:07] <fusion27> I'm having callback issues

[12:28:52] <hlve> When you click the button to generate another service user, it's generating the code to where there are two TD's within the TR (one with the label, one with the input)

[12:29:04] <fusion27> e
[12:29:19] <shoky> there's a div.fieldContainer but it only has the add button in it..
[12:29:27] <hlve> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/j5pa5/2/
[12:29:53] <shoky> hlve: that is all inside one <td>
[12:29:59] <shoky> valid stuff
[12:29:59] <hlve> You see the label "company" and the input to the right of it. how they're both wrapped in a TR TD DIV.fieldContainer
[12:30:34] <hlve> I'm trying to make it so when I click the button, it generates the same valid type of code, with the input and label within the same TD.
[12:30:51] <hlve> I never learned pure JavaScript though. Maybe I should have brought this to #Javascript
[12:30:51] <hlve> lol
[12:31:07] <shoky> it's an html issue ;)
[12:31:14] <Xtrivity> night all!
[12:31:27] <fusion27> My problem is with an asynchronous Ajax call
[12:32:15] <fusion27> I wanna use one function to fire off some ajax return it to the caller then the caller passes that off to another which then wraps is up in HTML
[12:33:01] <hlve> shoky, would it be relatively easy to just rewrite this function in jQuery within just a few lines?
[12:35:06] <fusion27> hehe, I got it!!

[12:52:36] <djsounds02> shoky: can you help me with slider again?
[12:52:42] <djsounds02> shoky: please
[12:59:31] <shoky> djsounds02: me and probably others, yes
[12:59:59] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com/
[13:00:10] <djsounds02> when it loads it jumps out of its container and looks all ugly
[13:03:29] <djsounds02> I think its because overflow:hidden is applied via a script?
[13:03:58] <djsounds02> surely there must be something I can do to stop it jumping though?
[13:05:36] <nicholasschulz> Don't be mad at me for asking this here please :-( , but the guys in html are still asleep! So: Hello world. This is probably easy for you guys, but I'm having a total blackout. Im creating a form <form action="results.php?state=CA&city=Berkeley" method="get"> â¦ however, when i click submit I only get the values from my form in the URL, not the state and cityâ¦. fix?
[13:06:10] <NoiseEee> nicholasschulz: if your backend is PHP, those variables will be in $_GET, not $_POST
[13:07:01] <nicholasschulz> that i know, but state and city doesn't show in the url even though I include it in my action
[13:07:13] <docmur> If it do a $.getJSON( index.php, data, function(text)) will it keep the the callback open until the script index.php dies?  As in can I keep echoing data back through the pipe
[13:07:24] <NoiseEee> nicholasschulz: what does that have to do with javascript or jquery?
[13:08:00] <razzi> nicholasschulz, maybe that's how forms work, try putting those variables inside hidden input elements
[13:08:09] <nicholasschulz> as i mentioned, the guys in html are still asleep so i figured one of you knew a really quick fix
[13:09:07] <nicholasschulz> thanks razzi
[13:13:28] <lindii_> hi... why i might be getting undefined index "term" in this code http://pastie.org/5069607
[13:14:12] <lindii_> im trying to use the autocomplete
[13:14:18] <docmur> change $_GET for $_REQUEST
[13:14:58] <NoiseEee> lindii_: uh, show us javascript, not php.
[13:15:34] <lindii_> but the problem is in the json i guess
[13:15:49] <lindii_> not the php
[13:15:49] <NoiseEee> lindii_: i guess you'll have to guess
[13:15:58] <NoiseEee> maybe the PHP creates totally invalid JSON
[13:16:13] <docmur> Lindii have you tried changing the $_GET for $_REQUEST
[13:16:15] <NoiseEee> either way, there is no javascript in your example.
[13:16:16] <docmur> the JSON by PHP is fine
[13:16:26] <lindii_> docmur:  i did it.. same thing
[13:16:38] <NoiseEee> docmur: with all due respect, you have no idea about the JSON returned because there is no JSON given in the sample.
[13:16:55] <lindii_> i was wondering if term is defined by the autocomplete
[13:17:25] <docmur> true but json_encdoe() does turn valid json encoded data of what ever it's passed so if you pass it the wrong data you'll get the wrong output
[13:18:14] <NoiseEee> docmur: wihch is what im saying.  perhaps there is bad output.  who knows?  we will forever guess until lindii_ shows some generated JS
[13:18:16] <lindii_> i can see the values of json in the header of the form
[13:19:00] <docmur> anyway, if you make a $.getJSON call does the pipe close when you get the first echo or does it stay open?
[13:19:50] <lindii_> this is my javascript.. simple http://pastie.org/5069636
[13:22:09] <black_warlock> how to get an item in sortable ui guys ?

[13:25:52] <black_warlock> just look the last part of jq code

[13:26:24] <black_warlock> when i move one item i need to alert the rel
[13:31:03] <goddard> how is jquery accordion nesting ?
[13:34:48] <black_warlock> ?
[13:34:58] <black_warlock> goddard asking to me ?
[13:35:35] <black_warlock> i found that trik on jsfiddle
[13:35:57] <dualcore> black_warlock: no he is not.  i think this is referring to the ul instead of the li
[13:37:01] <black_warlock> thats the trick to make nested sortable
[13:37:45] <black_warlock> pointing to the ul of certain div and then connecting it
[13:38:01] <black_warlock>  connectWith: "#conteiner ul",
[13:38:18] <black_warlock> i had problems with nested uls
[13:38:25] <black_warlock> but with that trick i solved it
[13:39:25] <dualcore> black_warlock: do you have a jsfiddle link to the fixed code?
[13:40:16] <black_warlock> i have it
[13:40:54] <KWhat_Work> Is there a simple example for using the _on widget function?
[13:41:04] <dualcore> black_warlock: i mean, would you provide that link?

[13:41:28] <black_warlock> i have searched any possible solution but this is the more stable
[13:42:03] <black_warlock> actually using the code in jq-ui samples will not provide any solution for nested uls
[13:43:08] <black_warlock> can somebody help getting informations from the <li> im moving ?
[13:45:08] <nchlssmith1> what is the best way to put an object into a variable, the object may not exists on the page.
[13:45:43] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/5yyUE/75/ see
[13:45:49] <goddard> it works with jquery 1.5.2 but not newer
[13:46:33] <goddard> works with 1.7.2 but no higher
[13:46:50] <goddard> so the newer version looses functionality?
[13:47:16] <NoiseEee> if you're upgrading jquery, update jqueryUI
[13:47:20] <NoiseEee> kind of makes sense when you take a moment
[13:47:52] <goddard> i am only referencing old code i have the newest version
[13:48:13] <goddard> this is the best way i have found to nest accordions but it doesn't work with the newest version

[13:48:35] <goddard> should I download the old one?
[13:48:49] <hlve> goddard: JSFiddle has the ability to load jQueryUI/BootStrap, Etc. Only on <1.7.2
[13:48:50] <NoiseEee> haizum_: ahhhhhh my eyes
[13:48:53] <black_warlock> uff nobody knows ?

[13:49:46] <NoiseEee> haizum_: $('#character_item6').toggleClass('character_item6_blur');  all those lines!!! please to put in function or something
[13:49:53] <goddard> hlve: its not autoloaded in 1.8.2?
[13:49:57] <hlve> goddard, no
[13:50:05] <hlve> jquery and jqueryui are two separate things
[13:50:27] <nchlssmith1> haizum: maybe a for loop to concat the numbers to the string?
[13:50:45] <hlve> goddard: http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/5yyUE/77/
[13:50:46] <hlve> see?
[13:50:48] <nchlssmith1> haizum: Might make the code easier to read.
[13:50:53] <black_warlock> hlve do you know how to get attributes of the items im dragging ?
[13:50:55] <hlve> I loaded jquery ui at the top of your code. 1.8.2 works just fine
[13:51:28] <hlve> i don't know why they removed the ability to load bootstrap/etc on 1.8.2 on jsfiddle.

[14:05:10] <Kcko> aaarggh damn UI
[14:05:11] <Kcko> why?
[14:05:13] <tw2113> nchlssmith1, use a line to select the intended div, and then use an if statement to check if you found it
[14:05:21] <tw2113> if not, do something else like exit or something
[14:05:48] <nchlssmith1> tw2113: line?
[14:06:03] <mike029> hi everyone, stupid noob question here. i have a variable 'pC_page_id' which is set to the id# of a div. i want to run $( * that ID * ).fadeIn();, i tried $("#" + pC_page_id).fadeIn(); but that didn't take
[14:06:05] <black_warlock> because the one by sarfatti its limited
[14:06:17] <black_warlock> and i need unlimited :P

[14:06:39] <NoiseEee> nchlssmith1: var div = $('div.toFind');  if(div.length) { //div was found } else { //was not found }
[14:06:54] <black_warlock> "i solved" its a big word i copied the solution
[14:06:57] <tw2113> nchlssmith1, your selector
[14:07:09] <tw2113> var mydiv = $('#somediv');
[14:07:29] <tw2113> if (mydiv.length > 0) { //do stuff }
[14:07:39] <nchlssmith1> NoiseEee, tw2113: well thats simple.  Guess I over thought it again.  Thanks.

[14:27:02] <Foxhoundz> eddiemonge, I think he wants to have a flip animation for the content on hover

[14:30:44] <zfly9> Kcko why did you copy and paste my messages
[14:31:11] <felipe_Brz> what's funny is that if I console.log the textarea content, I get the correct value, but visually it hasn't changed
[14:31:13] <zfly9> Foxhoundz, that seems to be on click
[14:31:14] <felipe_Brz> any dieas?
[14:31:19] <felipe_Brz> ideas*
[14:31:24] <zfly9> and for some reason I tried that anyway, and it just flips as soon as hte page loads and not on a click
[14:31:38] <Foxhoundz> zfly9, of course. You can trigger the flip animation on any event
[14:31:53] <Foxhoundz> read the docs
[14:34:05] <zfly9> foxhoundz where the heck are the docs

[14:37:03] <nchlssmith1> nicholasschulz: that is how i would do it. not saying its the best way.
[14:37:59] <nicholasschulz> ok. I'm now using .load and it sometimes takes forever to load itâ¦. you can see yourself if u didn't check it out already http://bannaky.com/buy.php
[14:38:43] <nchlssmith1> nicholasschulz: I think its your ajax that taking a while
[14:39:11] <nchlssmith1> try an ajax loader? did you?
[14:39:16] <nicholasschulz> do u know how I can fix that?
[14:39:44] <nchlssmith1> set up a jquery deferred and use an ajax loader in the interm
[14:40:01] <nchlssmith1> you know what I am talking about?
[14:40:17] <nicholasschulz> not exactly
[14:40:28] <nchlssmith1> thats ok hold on just a minute.

[14:41:41] <joshkwok> Hi there~  a quick question. In jQuery, is $(function(){}) equal to function(function(){}))(jQuery) ?
[14:41:49] <nchlssmith1> or maybe a better idea is to start an ajax loader when you make the request and stop it when you get the data.
[14:41:57] <nchlssmith1> with a callback
[14:42:45] <nchlssmith1> nicholasschulz: you can look at callbacks here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:49:41] <nchlssmith1> NoiseEee: when I use var = $("div.doesntexist");  It still puts an object into var whether the div is there or not any ideas?
[14:52:07] <nchlssmith1> I ended up with bpaste.net/show/NbdfBRN0qgH10Sp1OPZ1/  and I hate it so if anyone has any good ideas let me know thanks.
[14:52:45] <nchlssmith1> http://bpaste.net/show/PmIJHOC3egyLfWaZdudY/
[14:54:36] <nchlssmith1> that doesn't work either. arg

[15:12:43] <firstclassfunc> can I somehow pass into jquery a variable that contains HTML elements and be able to run queries/etc treating the variable as a document?

[15:31:43] <razzi> pretty smooth in chrome
[15:32:02] <jerry_> It goes too far then snaps to the location
[15:32:08] <jerry_> in FF
[15:32:15] <razzi> oh that
[15:32:30] <razzi> yeah need to have the numbers correct
[15:32:51] <jerry_> I can't figure it out, hard to measure scrolling things :/

[15:33:39] <jerry_> Also, go to section 6 then section 5.. really weird
[15:33:50] <MistuhKurtz> jerry_, are you calling event.preventDefault();
[15:33:50] <MistuhKurtz> ?
[15:33:56] <MistuhKurtz> I'll bet that's the problem
[15:34:00] <jerry_> I am

[15:34:05] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[15:34:09] <jerry_> http://jsfiddle.net/HSjGr/5/
[15:34:33] <jerry_> It snaps because I adjust the window.location.hash after the scroll animation, but if i scroll properly it shouldnt snap
[15:37:28] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[15:37:46] <jerry_> hm indeed
[15:38:02] <jerry_> I thought it would be so simple when I startedtoo lol
[15:38:22] <elijah> In the Chrome console why when I do a console.log and it references jquery it is wrapped in [] vs not for vanilla js?

[15:53:57] <haizum> anyone know why my 'unbind' isn't working?
[15:55:05] <jerry_> MistuhKurtz: got to http://jsfiddle.net/HSjGr/13/
[15:55:19] <jerry_> still ~10px of, i think its the section margin
[15:55:22] <jerry_> off*
[15:56:15] <MistuhKurtz> jerry_, what did you change?
[15:56:32] <jerry_> offset().top - $(window).scrollTop()
[15:56:48] <MistuhKurtz> not sure why the need for - $(window).scrollTop()
[15:57:03] <MistuhKurtz> 1. we're not manipulating the window's scrolltop, we're manipulating #centerPanel
[15:58:06] <MistuhKurtz> 2. it appears offset().top returns the current position relative to the top edge of the scroll frame, not the top edge of
[15:58:16] <MistuhKurtz> aw shit I think i figured it out while i was writing that. hold on. lol
[15:58:20] <jerry_> haha
[16:00:50] <MistuhKurtz> darn my idea was wrong
[16:00:52] <firstclassfunc> syborg: that example you pasted.. what if there are two divs? for some reason jQuery won't work correctly. I load an html template into variable htmlTmpl, but when I do $(htmlTmpl).html() it only shows the first div, not all divs
[16:01:05] <jerry_> I'm pretty sure it has something to do with margin
[16:01:07] <jerry_> somehow
[16:01:50] <jerry_> nope im wrong.  removed margin - still bugged
[16:02:18] <MistuhKurtz> ahh
[16:02:19] <MistuhKurtz> perfect :)
[16:02:20] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/HSjGr/16/
[16:02:44] <jerry_> fixe dit
[16:02:45] <jerry_> http://jsfiddle.net/HSjGr/17/
[16:02:54] <KWhat_Work> What happened to ui-helper-hidden?
[16:03:04] <MistuhKurtz> offset() returns a value relative to the document object. since we're scrolling a div, not the document, we needed position
[16:03:05] <jerry_> lol same timefix
[16:03:18] <jerry_> Yup.  Thanks for helping me with that man
[16:03:21] <MistuhKurtz> we also need to remove the increment thing
[16:03:23] <MistuhKurtz> +=
[16:03:46] <MistuhKurtz> and drop the $(window).scrollTop
[16:03:53] <MistuhKurtz> (see the code in my link)
[16:04:13] <jerry_> no u need +=
[16:04:15] <jerry_> go to 6 then 5
[16:04:30] <djsounds02> anybody knoe xpath?
[16:04:38] <MistuhKurtz> mine works perfect, you're probably looking at yours jerry_
[16:04:39] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/HSjGr/16/
[16:05:05] <jerry_> guess so, thanks bud
[16:05:48] <MistuhKurtz> of course position().top takes into consideration the margin and changing the location.hash does not
[16:06:25] <jerry_> mhm
[16:06:35] <jerry_> i need to subtract it
[16:06:36] <MistuhKurtz> jerry_, it might be superior to use Ben Alman's hashchange event plugin, prevent default, and fire all of this on hashchange
[16:06:55] <MistuhKurtz> then you already have everything bound so that when a user goes directly to page#hash it will scroll to it
[16:07:19] <jerry_> I look into it
[16:07:34] <MistuhKurtz> just one way I might approach it, vs looking for a hash on dom ready
[16:07:44] <MistuhKurtz> either way works
[16:08:14] <MistuhKurtz> I just like to hack away lines of code when possible :)
[16:08:54] <jerry_> yeah same
[16:10:09] <jerry_> I think it will be fine since theres only 1-5 hashes in the DOM in a small area
[16:10:15] <jerry_> but thx for the protip
[16:12:18] <firstclassfunc> jquery is returning me textnode, what the hell do I do with those
[16:17:08] <MistuhKurtz> jerry_, it seems that jquery's offset().top is different from the plain JS property offsetTop
[16:17:43] <MistuhKurtz> where offsetTop seems to be more similar to position().top than offset().top. There's another source of confusion for ya

[18:05:23] <mwmnj> Hey all, can anyne lend a hand with using the closest() method?
[18:05:24] <mwmnj> http://jsbin.com/amaquy/5/edit
[18:07:15] <coldhead> i don't see you using closest(), mwmnj
[18:07:38] <mwmnj> coldhead: if you see where I am using next, that is what I tried with closest
[18:07:59] <mwmnj> basically all errors should be showing if no input is provided
[18:08:10] <mwmnj> As you can see the first error, is not showing
[18:08:35] <mwmnj> This is because next only grabs the next element, which in the field1 case is a <br> not an error div
[18:08:38] <coldhead> closest() is for parents and grandparents
[18:08:45] <coldhead> you probably want to use ?nextUntil
[18:08:45] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[18:09:22] <mwmnj> nextUntil sounded like it got multiple elements when I read the docs on it
[18:09:27] <mwmnj> I want a single element
[18:12:47] <coldhead> it still has a better chance of getting the right sibling than closest() does
[18:13:49] <coldhead> mwmnj: http://jsbin.com/amaquy/6/edit ?
[18:14:04] <tw2113> i trust you're all being kind to the n00bie in here
[18:14:21] <tw2113> are people being kind coldhead ?
[18:14:39] <coldhead> i don't know, i hope so
[18:14:44] <coldhead> i haven't been paying attention

[19:00:07] <sinusss> why is the "select" part of this http://pastie.org/5070928 does not get triggered in Chrome when using the mouse? It works when I am using the Keyboard
[19:01:21] <BillCriswell> sinusss: There might be some other event listener on it?
[19:02:56] <sinusss> BillCriswell hmmm it conflicts with the $(".autocomplete").focusout();
[19:03:27] <lindii_> hey guys im getting  TypeError: $("#cliente").autocomplete is not a function   source : 'employees/add_employees.php' when i try to use the jquery autocomplete.. is this a problem with the path as im sure this is good
[19:05:04] <jcagumbay> did you include the jquery ui core?
[19:05:25] <sinusss> BillCriswell I think you are right. http://pastie.org/5070928 *updated* - how would I do a "focusout" on an autocomplete field?
[19:05:29] <pifantastic> lindii_: it means that you are either not including jqueryui, or including it before jQuery
[19:06:27] <lindii_> pifantastic: shouldn be that.. as im using the modals.. they are working fine
[19:08:36] <pifantastic> lindii_: did you include autocomplete in your build if jqueryui
[19:09:50] <lindii_> pifantastic: i have a file with all the js.. and i have a home.php which includes all the paths..
[19:10:28] <lindii_> pifantastic: i guess jquery-ui-1.7.3.custom.min.js includes autocomplete
[19:10:49] <jcagumbay> lindii_: maybe you could try to download again the jquery ui and make sure that all components are checked.
[19:11:16] <pifantastic> lindii_: can you link that file?
[19:11:22] <pifantastic> I can check if it has autocomplete
[19:11:32] <lindii_> pifantastic:  which one?
[19:11:42] <pifantastic> jquery-ui-1.7.3.custom.min.js
[19:12:31] <lindii_> pifantastic:  http://pastie.org/5070968
[19:12:48] <pifantastic> ha, no, I need the contents of the actual jquery-ui-1.7.3.custom.min.js file
[19:12:54] <lindii_> oh
[19:12:55] <lindii_> ok
[19:15:25] <lindii_> pifantastic:  http://pastebin.com/XYPEC9A3
[19:15:45] <pifantastic> lindii_: that file does not contain autocomplete
[19:15:50] <pifantastic> sorry bro
[19:16:03] <lindii_> pifantastic: which one does
[19:16:04] <pifantastic> need to rebuild jqueryui
[19:16:12] <pifantastic> and make sure you include autocomplete
[19:16:34] <lindii_> pifantastic:  im a girl =)
[19:16:50] <pifantastic> my apologies!
[19:16:50] <coldhead> sorry about that too then, bro
[19:16:57] <black_warlock> how can i fadeiu and out class ?
[19:17:04] <black_warlock> fadein and out on class?
[19:17:16] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/fW5K2/6/
[19:17:21] <sinusss> http://pastie.org/5070928 Just found out that .focusout() conflicts with the "select" method for the jqueryui autocomplete. But I need to call something when the user "focusout" - IE: No match found in the autocomplete form
[19:17:28] <sinusss> ^ how would I do this?
[19:18:18] <lindii_> so.. does jquery-ui-1.8.4.custom.min.js include autocomplete?
[19:19:09] <sinusss> lindii_ yes I have included autocomplete. it works without the focusout()
[19:19:35] <sinusss> also firefox is okay. Chrome is unable to call the "select" when I have focusout()
[19:21:40] <pifantastic> lindii_: the fact that it has "custom" in the name means it was a custom build
[19:21:49] <pifantastic> lindii_: so whoever created it did not include autocomplete
[19:22:08] <lindii_> pifantastic:  thanks
[19:23:12] <sinusss> oh i thought it was me :/
[19:23:14] <sinusss> :P
[19:34:56] <lindii_> pifantastic: u were right now im not getting the error.. however i cant make it work hehe
[19:39:01] <black_warlock> how the hell can animate class with fade in and out
[19:39:30] <black_warlock> im looking for this ghost extension .animateClass() but cant find it anywhere

[20:42:40] <scar> is js required on that?

[22:05:30] <madprops> gnarf, i'll search for it
[22:05:32] <gnarf> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/docs/files/jquery-ba-throttle-debounce-js.html
[22:06:09] <gnarf> madprops: also
[22:06:28] <gnarf> madprops: also
[22:06:43] <gnarf> madprops: you could set it up to keep track of if it was already "at bottom" on the last even
[22:06:45] <gnarf> and if so
[22:06:50] <gnarf> not "alert" or call the fn
[22:06:57] <gnarf> just keep track of the last state in a var
[22:08:23] <gnarf> madprops: http://jsfiddle.net/BH4B6/
[22:09:29] <scar> how can i find the current form of an element?
[22:10:16] <madprops> gnarf i get ya, i just hoped there was an easier way around it, but i think i'll do that
[22:15:32] <Cork> scar: current form?
[22:15:56] <Cork> scar: the dom doesn't keep states
[22:19:18] <hola> Is there anything wrong with this that would cause it to not work in ie9? http://jsfiddle.net/cjD58/
[22:20:38] <Cork> hola: that question is too generic
[22:20:59] <Cork> and if possible give a working example that doesn't work instead of dead code
[22:21:48] <hola> would a link to the site help ?
[22:22:52] <Cork> its better at least
[22:24:54] <hola> the image slider down the bottom works in firefox and chrome but not ie
[22:24:58] <hola> i cant see any trailing commas
[22:25:49] <hola> it may be a conflict with search autocomplete or the other image slider but seems strange it only breaks on ie9
[22:30:29] <Palanivel> hey am new for jquery events.......i wanna disable back button of my web page.............
[22:30:42] <Palanivel> if any one know..please let me know
[22:30:43] <mms_> http://jsfiddle.net/imiten/KUEH5/ ....I am trying to submit max_from_json { range : [1,2,5] } ....range is int[]....can you help understand what I am doing wrong...its posting lost of requests
[22:34:22] <mms_> never mind its working fine
[22:34:44] <Cork> mms_: you shouldn't jsonify the object
[22:34:50] <Cork> sorry the array
[22:35:10] <Cork> oh wait it is an object :)
[22:35:18] <mms_> Cork: yes its working
[22:35:46] <Cork> mms_: data takes a javascript object or a param string
[22:35:56] <Cork> not a json string
[22:36:43] <Cork> mms_: btw you might want to look into serialize see $.serializeArray
[22:36:56] <Cork> <_<
[22:37:00] * Cork pokes bot-t 
[22:37:02] <mms_> Cork: let me check
[22:37:15] <Cork> ugg its ? >_<'
[22:37:19] <Cork> ?.serializeArray
[22:37:19] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[22:37:34] <miCSu> does live method work with 'each' ?
[22:38:08] <Cork> miCSu: that sounds like a miss understanding of live; but please show your code
[22:38:13] <Cork> ?p
[22:38:14] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:40:16] <miCSu> Cork: I'm having elements and subelements recursively.. when the + button is pressed, it gets the subelements of clicked +
[22:40:30] <miCSu> I would also like to have like "show whole tree" button
[22:41:23] <miCSu> so that when the ajax gets back more plus buttons it would run the same code for them
[22:41:48] <miCSu> or append them to the each cycle or something
[22:45:09] <hola> anyone happen to have a good guide for diagnosing jquery conflicts when there are no error messages?
[22:45:58] <Cork> hola: normally its about finding where it fails through debug output
[22:46:48] <hola> I dont even know where to start
[22:46:58] <hola> i added the code to jsfiddle and it works there
[22:47:02] <hola> so is definately something on page
[22:47:34] <Cork> hola: start by commenting out most of the code, and just make a simple debug message
[22:47:38] <hola> that is ie specific
[22:47:39] <Cork> is if it works
[22:47:48] <Cork> *see if it works
[22:47:56] <hola> hard part is its in joomla so not super easy to comment out other bits
[22:48:04] <Cork> if it does, reenable a few lines at a time and check if it works
[22:48:24] <Cork> thats normally the quickest way to solve ie problems
[22:48:39] <hola> ok this is weird
[22:48:44] <hola> its working this time
[22:48:49] <hola> and i have changed nothing
[22:49:11] <miCSu> perhaps something to do with ie compatibility view?
[22:49:38] <hola> working in one tab but not the other :/
[22:50:05] <Noodlewitt> could also be some sort of race condition.. something loading before something else is finished?
[22:50:16] <hola> i think it must be that Noodlewitt
[22:50:27] <hola> only reason i can think for it randomly working
[22:50:59] <Cork> it could be a lot of things, but its only wild guesses unless one can see the page in action
[22:51:00] <Noodlewitt> good luck debugging that then :/
[22:51:06] <mms_> Cork:                 console.log( $("#max_form_json").find("input").serializeArray() );    is that right ?
[22:51:30] <Cork> mms_: no need for the find
[22:51:47] <Cork> $("#max_form_json").serializeArray() should work just fine
[22:51:53] <hola> this is the page http://clients.holacreative.com.au/empire/ only appears to not work on ie9
[22:52:02] <hola> image slider down the bottom
[22:52:20] <Cork> what ie version did you have problem with?
[22:52:41] <hola> 9.0.8112.16421
[22:53:41] <hola> does it work for you on ie ?
[22:53:52] <Cork> one sec, need to compare it
[22:54:03] <Cork> no it does not
[22:54:05] <hola> keep in mind sometimes it does randomly work
[22:55:57] <Cork> unrelated but looks like your calling the fb plugin in the wrong order
[22:56:22] <hola> yeah i dont think that plugin is even used on the page from what i could see
[22:56:34] <hola> might see if i can find where to disable it
[22:57:18] <Cork> ok, so its not a network problem
[22:57:27] <zsoc> Is anyone familiar with qtip? I loaded it and tested to make sure it was loaded, which it was.. but i can't get even the simpliest of examples to work (it's a tooltip lib)
[22:57:32] <hola> i did read somewhere that having a console.log call can put ie into developer mode or something
[22:58:03] <Cork> no it will crash if ie isn't in developer mode
[22:58:10] <hola> ok
[22:58:18] <Cork> (console is undefined unless ie is in developer mode)
[23:00:02] <Cork> wait a min...
[23:00:12] <Cork> why are you scoping you code inside the ready callback??
[23:00:23] <hola> desperation
[23:00:47] <hola> it shouldnt be ?
[23:00:50] <Cork> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { (function($) { })(jQuery); is really depricated
[23:01:00] <Cork> definitely not
[23:01:02] <hola> what should i use instead ?
[23:01:08] <mms_> I edit script in firebut and the post the form it behaves weird.   it makes numerous post requests
[23:01:09] <Cork> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[23:01:16] <zsoc> if(jQuery().qtip) {
[23:01:16] <zsoc> alert("qtip loaded");
[23:01:17] <zsoc> } works.. so where is the next top? Not the simptest .qtip() function is working. How do i start to debug something like this.
[23:01:23] <zsoc> oops, sorry line spam.
[23:01:27] <Cork> hola: the inner scope is just bloat
[23:01:36] <hola> ok so just remove the inner function stuff ?
[23:01:40] <hola> will try that
[23:01:49] <Cork> hola: is this code live?
[23:01:56] <Cork> or is it ok to add debug actions?
[23:02:05] <hola> can add debug
[23:02:49] <Cork> then before the anythingSlider add this: console.log('ready: ' + $('#slider3').length);
[23:03:29] <hola> inside the ready bit ?
[23:03:34] <Cork> yes
[23:04:38] <hola> hmm did that work?
[23:04:42] <hola> dont see any log message
[23:04:59] <hola> ah there we go
[23:05:01] <hola> 0
[23:05:12] <AdamPDotty> 1
[23:05:13] <Cork> so the id doesn't exist
[23:05:34] <hola> if i replace $ with jQuery in console it returns 1 ?
[23:05:46] <hola> console.log('ready: ' + jQuery('#slider3').length);
[23:05:47] <madprops> anybody knows an easy way to hide scrollbars yet letting them scroll with the mousewheel?
[23:06:47] <Cork> hola: you shouldn't try by running code after the page has loaded
[23:06:49] <hola> ah i see it shows 1 in firefox
[23:06:50] <hola> not ie
[23:07:49] <hola> i see <ul id="slider3"> ?
[23:07:54] <Cork> hola: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fclients.holacreative.com.au%2Fempire%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[23:08:00] <Cork> you have structure errors
[23:08:09] <Cork> (last two errors)
[23:08:21] <hola> ah thanks
[23:10:49] <hola> would that be causing the error ?
[23:11:15] <Cork> structure errors
[23:11:27] <Cork> its a fairly generic error
[23:11:29] <madprops> the plugin site is always under development
[23:11:39] <hola> anyway to find out what element is open causing the section error ?
[23:12:23] <Cork> hola: simplest is to just sitdown and fix the indention of the page (on a html file dump)
[23:12:30] <mms_> firebug has issue....I edit some jquery and it just does not take effect
[23:12:39] <Cork> that way you see when start and end tags doesn't line up
[23:13:04] <hola> ok fixed that
[23:13:35] <hola> damn didnt fix the jquery problem
[23:14:20] <Cork> lol did you expect it to be that easy :)
[23:14:27] <hola> can always hope :P
[23:15:06] <hola> wonder if moving script load orders around would do anything
[23:16:07] <Cork> hola: a tip (i know this is damn hard in cms systems) is to always load your css tags in head, and js tags in head or foot
[23:16:16] <Cork> (foot == end of body tag)
[23:16:30] <hola> might try moving some off the css code out of inline and into the head
[23:17:04] <Cork> cause inline css is actually invalid
[23:17:22] <Cork> uh.. sorry style tags in body
[23:19:03] <hola> didnt help
[23:21:14] <Cork> ugg i know what it is
[23:21:20] <hola> holy crap you do?
[23:21:30] <Cork> lets unless you changed it
[23:21:34] <Cork> let me reaload
[23:22:19] <Cork> heh nope you moved it :)
[23:22:56] <hola> damn
[23:24:08] <Cork> try this: after the anythingSlide div add <script>console.log('tick');</script>
[23:25:01] <hola> done
[23:25:03] <hola> 0 and tick
[23:25:12] <Cork> thought so
[23:25:24] <hola> what does the 0 mean? it cant find #slider3 element ?
[23:25:24] <Cork> ready doesn't do anything after body starts parsing in ie
[23:25:29] <Cork> ya
[23:25:43] <Cork> your not waiting for the dom to parse so it doesn't exist
[23:26:14] <hola> hmm how do i fix that ?
[23:26:20] <Cork> so either move the script tag to after the anythingSlide div, and let that be like that
[23:26:31] <Cork> or move it to the head or end of body (where it should be)
[23:26:48] <Cork> you can remove the ready call, it doesn't do anything
[23:27:04] <hola> you are a genius
[23:27:14] <Cork> if you leave it in relation to the anythingSlide
[23:27:37] <Cork> hola: the ready: 0 was the give away
[23:27:46] <Cork> that meant the code ran without the id in the dom
[23:27:53] <hola> ah i understand
[23:28:00] <Cork> so either the parsing failed or the code ran to early
[23:28:03] <mms_> Cork: I do not quite understand how serializeArray will help me get json as I want
[23:28:14] <Cork> mms_: you don't want json
[23:28:14] <hola> thanks so much for your help.. hopefully if i run into it again at least i know what to look for
[23:28:45] <mms_> Cork: how come ? I mean string of json
[23:29:04] <mms_> http://jsfiddle.net/imiten/KUEH5/ ...tell me how to replace that stringify ?
[23:29:40] <Cork> mms_: you don't
[23:29:48] <Cork> mms_: data doens't take a json string
[23:30:03] <mms_> Cork: am I not passing one to it ?
[23:30:12] <Cork> you are, but thats invalid
[23:30:41] <mms_> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6255344/how-can-i-use-jquery-to-post-json-data?rq=1
[23:31:42] <hola> ah crap i broke something removing ready
[23:31:49] <Cork> mms_: thats wrong
[23:31:59] <mms_> oh man its got 8 points !
[23:32:00] <Cork> you need { json: JSON.stringify() }
[23:32:21] <mms_> ok let me try that
[23:32:23] <Cork> else data tries to use the json as a param string
[23:32:33] <mms_> ok let me try
[23:34:50] <mms_> its pain to edit jquery/javascript and redeploy and test
[23:36:28] <mms_> Cork: 			data: {range: JSON.stringify ([$("#num1").val(), $("#num2").val(), $("#num3").val()] ) },   does not work well
[23:36:46] <mms_> it sends some binary across
[23:37:32] <Myx0x3> is $("#id).val(); slower then document.getelementbyid(id).value ?
[23:37:40] <Myx0x3> or is it the same?
[23:38:06] <mms_> Cork: it does not work for me
[23:45:41] <mms_> Cork: hello....I tried and it does not really work
[23:58:13] <ussher_> im trying to understand jplayer.  the href is just 'javascript:;'  and nothing occurs in the browser console when i click "play" but the player does start playing.  How can I see/know what is happening on that click?
[23:58:17] <ussher_> http://jplayer.org/latest/demo-01-video-solution-flash-html/?theme=0
[23:58:48] <ussher_> is there some way of seeing what events/functions are triggered?
