[06:33:32] <spinningCat> show and hide is slow on mobile
[06:47:02] <spinningCat> show and hide is quiet slow in mobile why is that?
[06:50:28] <thykka> you can change the animatino duration
[06:51:26] <spinningCat> that is not what i meant actually
[06:51:31] <thykka> also, those methods are not very performant in the first place, they animate properties that don't benefit from hardware acceleration
[06:51:35] <spinningCat> it lags when showing or hiding
[06:51:40] <thykka> right
[06:52:14] <spinningCat> should i usee adding, removing class class intead of hide(), show()
[06:52:26] <thykka> if you can, then definitely
[06:52:50] <spinningCat> of course i can
[06:52:50] <thykka> but it's not trivial to replicate .hide and .show in pure CSS
[06:52:58] <spinningCat> also i can use css animation
[06:53:20] <spinningCat> thykka,  it is display:none display:block right
[06:53:24] <thykka> yes, but if you want it to be smooth and fast, you can't animate anything but opacity and/or transform
[06:53:36] <thykka> display is not an animatable property
[06:53:51] <spinningCat> oh i see
[06:54:00] <spinningCat> opacity seems easy
[06:54:16] <spinningCat> i dont know about transform tbh
[06:54:22] <spinningCat> i need to search for that
[06:54:39] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform
[06:55:17] <spinningCat> i have ten pages
[06:55:30] <spinningCat> i guess i need to place each div one onto another
[06:57:00] <spinningCat> while changing opacity can i give some animation
[06:57:04] <spinningCat> i guess i can do
[07:00:08] <spinningCat> so you suggest to me not using show and hide for animating things on the web page?
[07:02:31] <thykka> only if it's small and subtle, and doesn't have a bad performance impact
[07:04:43] <spinningCat> i see
[07:04:51] <spinningCat> okay i understand what you meant thanks
[07:05:03] <spinningCat> i will prepare fiddle example later on
[07:05:22] <spinningCat> btw are you the one who defend getting rid of jquery is good practice?
[07:06:03] <thykka> i would not choose jquery for any new product, no
[07:06:26] <spinningCat> plain javascript?
[07:07:01] <thykka> ES6-9, yes
[07:08:58] <spinningCat> is there es-9?
[07:09:25] <spinningCat> dang
[07:09:28] <spinningCat> it was fast
[07:48:42] <aruns> Hey guys, can I use https://api.jquery.com/animate/ with keyframes?
[09:52:00] <aruns> ?
[09:58:41] <z1haze> good morning -- so what would be a way to have a link inside an element that already has a click handler applied to it, but i want to do something different with that link
[09:59:19] <z1haze> i thought i would be able to just check the e.target but i have an <u> inside my link so thats not working
[10:09:36] <z1haze> nvm stopImmediatePropagation did the trick
[13:20:35] <destramic> im having problems with animation if someone can please point oout what is wrong....https://jsfiddle.net/3fw7m42o/  if you click next the password input comes below the next button...but then if you click change user it all slides inline like i want
[13:21:03] <destramic> how to make it all slide inline when you click the next button please?
[13:21:20] <robertmaxrees> destramic that's a css issue.  you have styles causing layout headaches.
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> you're also missing jquery ui's css file :)
[13:22:24] <destramic> robertmaxrees: thank you for your help
[14:01:42] <spinningCat> i can add opacity class succesfully but div does not appear https://jsfiddle.net/vuLjc10f/2/ what is the reason of that? i did opacity:0 ?
[14:03:18] <spinningCat> dang
[14:03:19] <shoky_> spinningCat: .addClass('opacity')   not .addClass('.opacity')
[14:03:35] <shoky_> also probably that .data() is not doing what you think it is
[14:03:37] <spinningCat> sorry
[14:03:43] <spinningCat> i fixed that
[14:03:53] * spinningCat head to the desk
[14:04:18] <shoky_> not the desk's fault
[14:04:26] <spinningCat> data('target')
[14:05:21] <spinningCat> is that what you mentioned?
[14:05:39] <shoky_> the .data('id',..)  part
[14:05:59] <shoky_> that sets the data item called 'id'
[14:07:34] <spinningCat> oh
[14:07:39] <spinningCat> that must be attr
[14:07:43] <spinningCat> sorry
[14:08:03] <shoky_> .attr('id', ...)  sets the id attribute ;p
[14:08:31] <spinningCat> attr('id') get theattribute right
[14:08:45] <spinningCat> that line i need to fix
[14:09:31] <shoky_> you just need to select by id, really
[14:12:33] <spinningCat> i just try to add opacity class to spesific div
[14:14:16] <shoky_> $('#<the id here>').addClass('opacity')
[14:27:30] <spinningCat> hmm why that doesnt work https://jsfiddle.net/vuLjc10f/3/
[14:28:11] <shoky_> you don't need the if..
[14:28:18] <shoky_> just:   $('#<the id here>').addClass('opacity')
[14:28:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:28:27] <shoky_> no need for the .each either..
[14:28:50] <spinningCat> but each button will hide spesific div
[14:29:02] <shoky_> then make sure you're using the specific id :p
[14:29:23] <spinningCat> well okay
[14:29:30] <spinningCat> as you say so
[14:29:33] <robertmaxrees> spinningCat considered going through learn.jquery.com?
[14:31:09] <spinningCat> i wrote a lot of jquery but i forgot now i am really overwhelmed by something anyway
[14:32:09] <shoky_> take it slowly step by step. just focus on the current small step - don't get overwhelmed
[14:32:27] <shoky_> pro tip :p
[14:32:28] <spinningCat> no people distracted me
[14:32:41] <shoky_> that's bad too
[14:32:47] <shoky_> work from home :(
[14:32:52] <spinningCat> people distracted everyone i am sure
[14:33:56] <spinningCat> i work on somewhere and people start mobbing me and fire me
[14:34:22] <spinningCat> life is shit i start getting used good code then lose my job
[14:34:26] <spinningCat> anyway
[14:34:33] <spinningCat> and i forgot details start over
[15:21:36] <spinningCat> what a i doing wrong in second if i just try to get all divs opacity is 1.
[15:21:38] <spinningCat> https://jsfiddle.net/vuLjc10f/5/
[15:22:08] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:22:13] <robertmaxrees> openyour dev tools my guy
[15:23:29] <spinningCat> i saw the error
[15:23:34] <robertmaxrees> so then fix it :)
[15:24:20] <spinningCat> i am sure i have paranthesis error
[15:24:43] <robertmaxrees> so then fix it? :)
[15:25:11] <robertmaxrees> also: $('#' + $('div :not(#' + $(this)).data('target').removeClass('opacity') lolwut
[15:25:35] <spinningCat> dam
[15:25:51] <robertmaxrees> what is that even trying to do?
[15:28:15] <spinningCat> try to select other elements
[15:28:41] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:28:45] <robertmaxrees>  $('#' + $('div :not(#' + $(this))
[15:28:55] <robertmaxrees> that's really, really weird.
[15:29:04] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to get all divs except for $(this)?
[15:29:51] <spinningCat> yes
[15:30:11] <spinningCat> :not is for that i read
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> just use http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:30:16] <spinningCat> div :not
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> and pass $(this)
[15:36:16] <spinningCat> damn it
[15:36:21] <spinningCat> type of opacity is string
[15:36:26] <spinningCat> i suppose it is integer
[15:38:22] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to toggle opacity on each div?
[15:38:26] <robertmaxrees> is that all this is doing?
[15:40:22] <robertmaxrees> spinningCat
[15:40:27] <spinningCat> finally https://jsfiddle.net/vuLjc10f/6/
[15:40:38] <robertmaxrees> that's... weird.
[15:40:41] <robertmaxrees> and don't use :not
[15:40:45] <spinningCat> my mind is really messed up right now
[15:40:47] <spinningCat> hmm
[15:40:53] <spinningCat> what should i use?
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> use the method i linked you to earlier.
[15:41:04] <spinningCat> i read stackoverflow
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:41:09] <spinningCat> i missed that
[15:41:16] <robertmaxrees> so you ignored the channel after we gave you feedback?
[15:41:56] <spinningCat> you suggest me to use "not" above
[15:42:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> the method.
[15:42:05] <robertmaxrees> not the selector.
[15:42:10] <spinningCat> and pass $(this)
[15:42:12] <spinningCat> ah ok
[15:42:16] <spinningCat> i am sorry
[15:42:23] <spinningCat> can i ask why?
[15:43:42] <robertmaxrees> crammping everything into selectors like that is incredibly hard to read and very error prone, expecially when you're avoiding using vars.
[15:43:47] <robertmaxrees> which is exactly your case here :)
[15:44:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd just do something like this instead: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dvz5henk/2/
[15:46:52] <spinningCat> thank you
[15:47:03] <spinningCat> so you are also musician
[15:47:06] <spinningCat> that is cool :D
[15:47:10] <robertmaxrees> lol yeah
[15:47:44] <spinningCat> i play drums
[15:47:58] <robertmaxrees> cool...
[15:48:45] <spinningCat> good day for now
[15:49:00] <spinningCat> i feel really bad one of my friend depressed me
[15:49:09] <spinningCat> have a good day
[15:49:14] <robertmaxrees> feel free to PM me if you wanna talk meng.
[15:49:25] <spinningCat> what is meng?
[15:49:31] <spinningCat> just wonder
[15:49:38] <robertmaxrees> just a funny way to say "man".
[15:49:50] <spinningCat> welp
[15:50:01] <spinningCat> hope it is appropriate here "welp"
[15:50:02] <spinningCat> :D
[15:50:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:50:10] <spinningCat> i like electro guitar so much
[15:50:16] <spinningCat> i need to go now
[16:53:01] <z1haze_> in order to use stopImmediatePropagation do event listeners have to be attached in any specific order?
[16:53:21] <Taplar> iirc, the first event listener attached is the first executed
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> ^ it's in order they were attached.
[16:53:55] <robertmaxrees> though I'd be real careful relying on stuff like that.
[16:55:41] <z1haze_> ok, so i have a div that is clickable, and i have a link inside that clickable div that i need to do something different
[16:56:10] <Taplar> that wouldn't be stopImmediatePropagation
[16:56:13] <Taplar> just stopPropagation
[16:56:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:56:33] <z1haze_> does event binding order matter in this case then
[16:56:36] <Taplar> no
[16:56:45] <Taplar> it's not the same element.  it's a parent child relationship
[16:56:48] <robertmaxrees> but also
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> do you only want to register clicks on just the div?  or are there other child elements that you want to permit
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:57:27] <z1haze_> clicks to register on the div itself, and then another event registered on a link inside that clickable div
[16:57:57] <z1haze_> eg we have a row that users can click on to 'select' it. in that row there is also an 'edit' button that would perform a different action
[16:58:15] <z1haze_> currently both actions are firing when putting stop propagation on the child lnk
[16:58:17] <robertmaxrees> okay - so there ARE other child elements in play.
[16:58:18] <z1haze_> link
[16:58:41] <z1haze_> interesting
[16:58:57] <z1haze> heh
[16:59:07] <z1haze> so Taplar any suggestion here then?
[16:59:24] <Taplar> i'm not sure why stopPropagation of the link would let it bubble up to the div
[16:59:46] <Taplar> can you make a fiddle?
[16:59:47] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/8dccf959c5bf
[17:00:07] <Taplar> ah
[17:00:08] <Taplar> lol
[17:00:12] <Taplar> it's a delegate dude
[17:00:15] <z1haze> yeah
[17:00:20] <Taplar> it's already propagated
[17:00:22] <z1haze> it comes and goes
[17:00:23] <z1haze> ah damn
[17:00:39] <z1haze> so i cant use a delegated event for this?
[17:00:40] <Taplar> :)
[17:00:48] <Taplar> not at the document level, no
[17:00:52] <z1haze> shoot
[17:01:01] <z1haze> i hate rebinding all the time
[17:01:37] <Taplar> you could add logic to the other event handler to check if the event originated from the link
[17:01:48] <Taplar> event.originalTarget iirc
[17:01:58] <z1haze> currentTarget?
[17:02:06] <Taplar> no, currentTarget would be the row
[17:02:07] <Taplar> div
[17:02:20] <Taplar> originalTarget, iirc, is what it started on first
[17:02:22] <z1haze> so currentTarget is the one we bound to, target is the actual element clicked
[17:02:41] <z1haze> let me see on that
[17:02:46] <z1haze> thats not too hacky? ha
[17:03:06] <Taplar> would be better than rebinding imho
[17:03:40] <Taplar> ah nvm, don't do that
[17:03:44] <Taplar> it's not standardized
[17:03:53] <Taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/originalTarget
[17:04:45] <z1haze> blah
[17:04:50] <Taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target
[17:04:54] <Taplar> so i guess just event.target
[17:04:54] <z1haze> what if i justused target
[17:04:55] <z1haze> yeah exactly
[17:05:22] <Taplar> i forgot target is the dispatcher, where currentTarget changes with bubbling
[17:05:29] <Taplar> herp derp
[17:06:47] <Taplar> so if($(e.target).is(':not(.js-edit-address)')) { do stuff }
[17:08:20] <Taplar> though, really to make it super safe, you'd probably want to use closest()
[17:09:07] <Taplar> if($(e.target).closest('.js-edit-address').length < 1) { do stuff }
[17:09:14] <z1haze> target is the actual clicked element
[17:09:22] <Taplar> that way if the target is identified as a child of the link, and not the link itself, it would still filter it out
[17:09:37] <z1haze> i did this and its workin if ($(e.target).is('u')) { return }
[17:09:47] <Taplar> ah, :D
[17:09:48] <z1haze> sucks that its a <u> but its underlined
[17:09:48] <z1haze> ha
[17:09:53] <z1haze> it works
[17:10:33] <Taplar> i'd still suggest using the class as it's more self documenting
[17:10:48] <z1haze> well i do have the link itself with a clas
[17:10:52] <z1haze> js-edit-address
[17:11:02] <z1haze> but the target of that click is actually the <u> inside the link
[17:11:09] <Taplar> right, so look at that closest example i gave
[17:14:38] <Taplar> also a little code review.  i would suggest pulling copyForms out of the event handler.
[17:14:50] <Taplar> i'm also not sure that method is going to function properly with the usage of 'this'
[17:18:24] <Taplar> unless the this is supposed to be the edit button clicked, which would be valid
[17:18:55] <z1haze> it does
[17:19:22] <Taplar> ah, cool.  then yeah just that method being in that other event handler is a little smelly
[17:19:43] <z1haze> the copyForms one?
[17:19:55] <z1haze> if so, i agree
[17:20:02] <Taplar> yes
[17:20:15] <z1haze> i dont currently have any other use for it though, if i run across a case where i need it ill put it out
[17:20:25] <z1haze> (if i remember) haha
[17:20:35] <Taplar> it's not really an issue of reuse
[17:20:45] <Taplar> it's an issue of redeclaring it every time the event happens
[17:20:51] <z1haze> ahh ok
[17:20:56] <z1haze> ok right on ill move it
[17:20:56] <Taplar> it's a little anti-DRY
[17:21:31] <z1haze> yep, done
[17:21:55] <z1haze> thank you
[17:22:12] <Taplar> np
[18:17:45] <z1haze> have another question
[18:17:56] <Taplar> oh hell no
[18:17:58] <z1haze> ha
[18:17:58] <Taplar> sup?
[18:18:29] <z1haze> i have a change listener on a form, and form is considered valid, i make a request, and validates the form server side, and returns me a object that i update the form with
[18:18:43] <z1haze> the issue though, since i update the form with the response, i get needless multiple calls
[18:18:58] <Taplar> logically changing a form will not trigger change events
[18:19:09] <z1haze> hmm it is though
[18:19:23] <Taplar> how are you changing the form?
[18:19:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:19:32] <robertmaxrees> was just about to ask that
[18:19:39] <z1haze> $form.find('[name$=address1]').val(address.address1);
[18:19:48] <Taplar> yeah, that's not going to trigger change events
[18:20:01] <Taplar> which is why trigger(event) exists, :)
[18:20:10] <z1haze> ok let me confirm for sure then because thats the only thing im aware of making changes
[18:21:06] <z1haze> lol ok
[18:21:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6v7a83dm/1/ :
[18:21:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:21:11] <z1haze> it was my stupid autofill
[18:21:31] <z1haze> i autofilled 1 field and it decided to 'update' several others
[18:21:36] <Taplar> :)
[18:21:44] <z1haze> ok well that makes me feel better
[18:50:19] <Taplar> if it MAKES you haaaaapppppppppyyyyyyy
[18:50:35] <Taplar> it can't be that baaaaaaaaaaad
[18:53:08] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/9ff47027995c this should continue down the promise chain after this right?
[18:53:20] <z1haze> assuming there is more .then after of course
[18:53:43] * Taplar looks at robertmaxrees
[18:53:55] <Taplar> i'm not really clear on the whole chaning new promises stuff like that
[18:54:06] <Taplar> i want to say yes
[18:54:15] <z1haze> i thought i was too ha
[18:54:52] <Taplar> i'd hit up ##javascript for that one
[18:55:17] <z1haze> yeah, shouldhave asked there initially. i get confused what channel im in sometimes
[19:00:55] <Taplar> night all
[19:20:46] <sydbarret> anybody knows jinja as well?
[19:21:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in #python
[19:21:35] <yolan> Hello
[19:21:37] <yolan> Quick question
[19:21:53] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[19:23:29] <yolan> I have different number input, with the same class, I would like to call a function each time one of their values changes, so I did something like $(".class").each().on("change",function () { myfunction(); });
[19:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't need .each() there.
[19:23:43] <yolan> But I guess it's not like this lol
[19:23:57] <yolan> well it did not work without toot :/
[19:24:03] <robertmaxrees> you can just do $('.class').on('change', myFunction);
[19:24:04] <yolan> too*
[19:24:08] <yolan> ok...
[19:24:11] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need.
[19:24:13] <yolan> Let me try again !
[19:24:25] <robertmaxrees> (leave off the parens after myFunction btw);
[19:24:30] <yolan> btw, phpstorm tells me that on is deprecated
[19:24:40] <robertmaxrees> it is absolutely not deprecated.
[19:24:48] <robertmaxrees> in fact, it's preferred.
[19:25:00] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees any idea of why this doesnt work ?  https://bpaste.net/show/3a3c29a8a531
[19:25:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:25:32] <robertmaxrees> what's with the .nodes()?
[19:25:39] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do sydbarret?
[19:25:58] <sydbarret> im trying to add that datatable button
[19:26:05] <sydbarret> based on that jinja paid variable
[19:26:12] <robertmaxrees> dunno.  i'd need to see a fiddle :shrug:
[19:26:30] <robertmaxrees> but also - don't use jinja to dynamically inject script tags.
[19:26:43] <robertmaxrees> print out a global object that holds this kind of info.
[19:26:48] <sydbarret> can i do the other way around then?
[19:26:56] <sydbarret> i mean insert jinja inside jquery?
[19:26:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:26:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:27:04] <robertmaxrees> jinja is python.
[19:27:17] <robertmaxrees> also: this won't work if thta script tag comes before the datatables init.
[19:27:50] <sydbarret> how you would solve it then?
[19:28:33] <sydbarret> to hide button allegedly is https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/47843/i-need-to-hide-the-excel-pdf-print-buttons-and-searchbox-on-datatable-when-no-result-on-filtering
[19:28:37] <robertmaxrees> print out a global object that has information like this or make an api that you can ccall for stuff like this.
[19:28:53] <sydbarret> how do you print a global object?
[19:28:57] <sydbarret> is that jinja or jquery?
[19:29:16] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're real confused about how jinja and jquery work :)
[19:29:21] <robertmaxrees> that would be in jinja
[19:29:39] <robertmaxrees> you want to print out the JSON object.  const window.myGlobalObject = {};
[19:29:54] <robertmaxrees> where {} is the JSON you care about.
[19:30:37] <sydbarret> im not taking to print nothing, i wanna hide a datatable button
[19:30:47] <sydbarret> i dont unsertand how you can assing a button to a jinja global variable
[19:30:56] <robertmaxrees> you aren't.
[19:31:05] <robertmaxrees> datatables and jinja have nothing to do with each other.
[19:31:23] <robertmaxrees> the first problem you need to solve is exposing data from python to js.
[19:31:45] <robertmaxrees> then you can read that global object in your code later.
[19:39:29] <yolan> Ok, so I think there is something that I don't understand in js or jquery
[19:39:53] <robertmaxrees> yolan show your code in a bpaste or somethin' :)
[19:40:03] <yolan> Any idea why the function setPriceOffers only return 0
[19:40:04] <yolan> https://hastebin.com/idimewozoy.js
[19:40:10] <yolan> robertmaxrees, thank you :)
[19:40:47] <robertmaxrees> so you'r ejust curious about that one var?
[19:41:30] <robertmaxrees> can you show an example of what that all_offers_selected var is?
[19:41:31] <yolan> I am curious as of why everything I push in my array is still 0 even tough my inputs have value
[19:41:44] <robertmaxrees> oh
[19:41:47] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[19:41:52] <yolan> ^__^
[19:42:04] <yolan> out of scope?
[19:42:04] <robertmaxrees> you need to do all those lookups within the change handler.
[19:42:12] <yolan> ok
[19:42:16] <robertmaxrees> const menu_gastro_quantity = $('#menu-gastro').val(); runs only when it's called.
[19:42:30] <yolan> this...make perfect sense
[19:42:34] <yolan> lol
[19:42:42] <yolan> yes thank you ^^

[19:43:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:43:18] <robertmaxrees> pretty solid little run-through
[19:43:45] <yolan> I will
[19:43:51] <yolan> eager to learn javascript
[19:43:54] <yolan> the langage of the future
[19:43:59] <yolan> \o/
[19:44:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:44:10] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say that, but yeah.  it's popular.
[19:44:25] <yolan> Nowadays, javascript power server, front end , back end
[19:44:31] <yolan> It's always good to master it
[19:44:36] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[19:44:41] <robertmaxrees> it CAN do those things.
[19:44:48] <robertmaxrees> but it's not always the right choice :)
[19:44:52] <yolan> Ys
[19:44:54] <yolan> Yes
[19:45:14] <yolan> Ok thank you stranger o/
