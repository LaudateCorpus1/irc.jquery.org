[00:23:01] <ramers> no  one    told  in  your channel.
[00:23:13] <ramers> it is  just    alonne  .
[00:23:20] <ramers> ta===htat  all.
[00:23:40] <ramers> it is  just alone     that   all.
[00:23:48] <ramers> i  am  not  sorry.
[00:24:01] <ramers> can't   do  sorry.
[00:24:25] <ramers> told in  english  is  not  me.
[00:24:40] <ramers> well.
[00:24:45] <ramers> you  are.
[00:25:16] <ramers> iam not  sorry.
[00:28:09] <Uhkis> well that wasn't random at all :D
[00:28:23] <nodist> its that bot again
[01:54:34] <dimi1947> tell me this...if an ajax request fails(and the error callback gets triggered)...I assume in such a case the server is never reached...am I right?
[01:54:46] <Cork> no
[01:54:56] <AcidBeard> 404
[01:54:57] <AcidBeard> 503
[01:55:16] <Cork> the error callback can be a server status response, or an exception in the ajax callback
[01:55:19] <Uhkis> 403 too i guess?
[01:55:28] <Cork> 4xx and 5xx
[01:55:31] <Cork> any of them
[01:55:46] <AcidBeard> Yeah, anything that means request not successful
[01:56:15] <Cork> well, that or a network error, or code error
[01:56:25] <dimi1947> so the server is reached and the error callback is triggered with 4xx and 5xx messages
[01:56:30] <Cork> the info sent to the callback will tell
[01:56:39] <Cork> dimi1947: doesn't have to be
[01:56:58] <AcidBeard> error call back is triggered for any event that isnt success
[01:57:04] <Cork> like i just said, it can be a network error, server response error, or code exception
[01:57:24] <dimi1947> but in any case the server is reached?
[01:57:29] <Cork> no
[01:57:41] <Cork> doesn't have to be -_-'
[01:57:45] <dimi1947> ok....let me describe what I want to do
[01:58:11] <Cork> dimi1947: the arguments to the callback will tell what error it is
[01:58:25] <dimi1947> whtn the error callback is called the administrator must somehow be informed...
[01:58:32] <Cork> the second argument is the text if the server returned a 4xx or 5xx error
[01:58:39] <Cork> the third is if something else failed
[01:59:07] <dimi1947> doea js sends e-mails?
[01:59:17] <Cork> no
[01:59:51] <dimi1947> how am I going to inform the admin about error callback fired?
[02:00:01] <nodist> use smtp to connect to an email to send
[02:00:09] <Cork> you could push it to a server resource
[02:00:27] <Cork> the server could send mail if you want
[02:00:35] <Cork> or store it in a database
[02:00:37] <Cork> or just log it
[02:00:50] <dimi1947> how I can push it to a server resource?
[02:01:05] <Cork> $.post or $.get
[02:01:07] <Cork> or $.ajax
[02:01:57] <dimi1947> so you are saying that when error callb. is fired make an ajax call to the server and from the the script will log it/send an e-mail
[02:02:12] <Cork> well if you want to know about it; yes
[02:03:51] <dimi1947> my intention is that the user just gets a message saying "something is wrong"...no details about the error
[02:04:24] <Cork> dimi1947: to elaborate on my earlier answer
[02:04:33] <Cork> dimi1947: no, js can't send mail, cause it would be from the users computer
[02:04:53] <Cork> dimi1947: and it would be a super chance for spammers to bot net basically the entire net
[02:05:36] <dimi1947> regarding that you said that the email that informs the admin must be sent by a  server script
[02:16:31] <dimi1947> is then any way I can log the errors somewhere locally and then access these?
[02:17:22] <dimi1947> that is...in the user's computer
[02:18:08] <JulianUU> localstorage?
[02:34:26] <Cork> dimi1947: if you log it locally on the users computer you can't access it from the server side no
[02:35:12] <Cork> dimi1947: like i said, if you want access to it you have to send it to the server
[02:35:18] <Cork> else only the user will have access
[02:42:14] <ifohancroft> Hey guys. I have html file that will have a form and stuff and on the form there will be a multiple select, the values of which need to be gotten from the database. How can I dynamically with jQuery ask PHP to fetch those for me from the database and give me them back so I can show them? (I know it is probably done with AJAX. I know what AJAX is I just well have never really used it and don't
[02:42:18] <ifohancroft> really know how to)
[02:46:02] <Dan987> I want to access a rest api which uses an OAuth2.0 authentication. How can i get the authentication token that is required to access the APIs? I am kinda confused here. Any ideas ?
[02:46:43] <Cork> Dan987: those apis are normally not meant to be used from js
[02:47:02] <Cork> cause that would mean you have to expose your private authentication in the js file
[02:48:35] <Dan987> Cork - I just want to test the APIs locally so having the username and password as text is fine as of now
[02:50:45] <Dan987> Cork - so generally these apis are accessed using a server side program ?
[02:50:53] <Cork> yes
[02:51:17] <Cork> bascially everything private can't be in the content you send to the user
[02:51:29] <Cork> as we... it isn't private if you share it :)
[02:51:41] <Cork> *as well...*
[02:52:11] <Cork> Dan987: anyway to get the token is something you normally do by calling the api
[02:52:23] <Cork> or register on there site (depending on the solution)
[03:03:10] <Dan987> Cork - i already have a username and password to the site. But their site has a different URL with console/v2 and the api has a URL like /api/v2. So here what URL i query first?
[03:03:44] <Cork> Dan987: you would have to read there api documentation
[03:06:39] <Dan987> Cork - they use the OAuth2.0 bearer token usage specification.
[03:07:03] <Cork> Dan987: that doesn't specify how the url works
[03:07:32] <hellyeah> he
[03:07:57] <hellyeah> what is my mistake here i am kinda beginner? When you click the button i expect to see the box http://jsfiddle.net/bhn8zdt4/4/
[03:08:34] <hellyeah> ops
[03:09:22] <Dan987> Cork - ya its /api/v2
[03:10:33] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/bhn8zdt4/5/
[03:16:31] <Dan987> Cork - The documentation is not good. How do i pass the user credentials to this URL and get back the authentication token? Is there any standard way ?
[04:03:49] <zeroquake> what is the right way to get utc time in millisec?
[04:06:03] <rollingWolf> microtime(true);
[04:06:15] <rollingWolf> or something like that anyway
[04:06:37] <Uhkis> rollingWolf: this aint php
[04:06:39] <rollingWolf> woops .. wrong channel ;)
[04:06:47] <rollingWolf> Uhki Yea I just realized ;)
[04:20:15] <zeroquake> lol
[04:23:47] <Cork> zeroquake: Date.now()
[04:24:19] <Cork> also called unix time
[04:25:20] <zeroquake> Yes , thank you.
[04:29:28] <Uhkis> Cork: doesn't that return time with current timezone?
[04:29:35] <Cork> nope
[04:29:44] <taplar> epoch is zoneless
[04:29:52] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now
[04:30:00] <Cork> "The Date.now() method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC."
[04:30:01] <zeroquake> it returns miniseconds which is same across all timezone
[04:30:16] <Cork> zeroquake: not really no
[04:30:19] <taplar> but since it's javascript it still relies on your local time being correct
[04:30:23] <Cork> it returns the unix time
[04:30:31] <Uhkis> also, unix timestamp is seconds?
[04:30:42] <zeroquake> isnt Date.now() same as  new Date().getTime()?
[04:30:54] <Cork> it is
[04:31:15] <Cork> the difference is you don't need to instanciate it to use .now
[04:31:19] <zeroquake> and that value is a constant across timezones? since its the count from 1970 thing
[04:31:34] <zeroquake> yes.
[04:31:51] <Cork> Uhkis: unix time is normally in clock ticks
[04:32:09] <zeroquake> Arnt clock ticks a constant no matter what timezone ?
[04:32:10] <Cork> and depending on language it can be down to 1000000 of a second
[04:32:27] <Cork> zeroquake: it doesn't depend on timezone ya
[04:32:41] <Cork> clock ticks has no sense of time at all
[04:32:56] <Cork> it just constantly increase a value
[04:33:00] <zeroquake> exactly it is independant of timezone
[04:33:08] <Cork> well not really
[04:33:19] <Cork> it depends on if you set it with a timezone or not
[04:33:29] <zeroquake> meaning?
[04:33:31] <Cork> for example windows use localtime for the clock
[04:33:40] <Uhkis> i recall trying to get execution time of a process once, ended up reading some weird stuff about jiffys etc :D
[04:33:42] <Cork> while all unix system normally use utc
[04:34:09] <decx> you made me remember swatch beat
[04:34:18] <zeroquake> so on an unix getTime counts from 1970 to current utc time
[04:34:18] <Cork> ah
[04:34:30] <Cork> decx: internet time ftw! :D
[04:34:34] <zeroquake> while on windows it would count from 1970 to current local time?
[04:34:38] <decx> what a rousing success that was haha
[04:34:50] <Cork> zeroquake: no, that isn't at all what i mean
[04:35:07] <Cork> by clock tick i talk about the actual hardware in the computer that updates the current time
[04:35:09] <Uhkis> decx: that was the "universal time" thing?
[04:35:16] <Cork> Uhkis: ya
[04:35:20] <Cork> the @ time
[04:35:28] <Cork> @246
[04:35:28] <zeroquake> i dont understand whats different between both?
[04:36:01] <Cork> zeroquake: what javascript exposes isn't the raw clock it is just the utc unix time
[04:36:18] <Cork> so it is always in utc
[04:36:43] <Uhkis> ?> print(Date.now())
[04:36:53] <Uhkis> js> print(Date.now())
[04:36:54] <Cork> js> print(Date.now())
[04:36:56] <b-ot> Uhkis: 976170155675
[04:37:01] <b-ot> Cork: 1437572307401
[04:37:04] <zeroquake> when i say new Date() doesnt it have local time value
[04:37:09] <hellyeah> hey
[04:37:10] <Cork> O_o
[04:37:11] <Uhkis> WHAT?
[04:37:23] <Cork> that ... was a slight difference
[04:37:27] <hellyeah> it didnt work as meantioned in the url http://jsfiddle.net/ec5mvm4t/3/ url is https://jqueryui.com/position/
[04:37:34] <Uhkis> yeah, slight :D
[04:37:40] <Cork> js> print((new Date).toString())
[04:37:42] <b-ot> Cork: Wed Jul 22 2015 13:39:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
[04:37:46] <zeroquake> woa....is the first pne PHP?
[04:37:48] <hellyeah> can you help me figure that out why it didnt work
[04:37:57] <Cork> it displays in my local time O_o
[04:38:08] <Uhkis> swedish bot busted!
[04:38:13] <Uhkis> js> print(Date.now())
[04:38:15] <b-ot> Uhkis: 1437572384904
[04:38:25] <Uhkis> that's one fast clock.. :D
[04:38:33] <Cork> weird
[04:39:09] <Uhkis> wtf
[04:39:22] <decx> js> print(performance.now())
[04:39:26] <b-ot> decx: No output.
[04:39:26] <Uhkis> js> print((new Date).toString())
[04:39:28] <decx> :(
[04:39:51] <Uhkis> now it broke :D
[04:39:55] <Cork> yup
[04:40:00] <abailarri> Hello. I hae ths script https://jsfiddle.net/drfy2o5u/ and the alert in th success callback no triggers. The response is 200 OK,. Any suggestions?
[04:40:02] <decx> i'm sorry
[04:40:04] <decx> ^^
[04:40:12] <Uhkis> anyways..
[04:40:23] <Uhkis> 22.7.2015 16.38.27 +0300
[04:40:33] <Cork> abailarri: bind an error handler
[04:40:38] <Uhkis> said date -d @1437572384
[04:40:39] <Cork> and check the THIRD argument
[04:41:01] <abailarri> Cork, but response in console is 200 ok, nos have any error
[04:41:06] <Uhkis> that's 2h more than it is here now :D
[04:41:17] <Cork> abailarri: there is more then server status codes that could trigger the error handler
[04:43:32] <abailarri> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/rhyc82te/ I not see anything
[04:43:58] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/rhyc82te/1/
[04:48:27] <taplar> hellyeah: just looking at it briefly it looks like position is a $.fn.position, not a parameter to $.fn.dialog as your using it
[04:48:57] <hellyeah> what is .fn
[04:49:03] <taplar> function
[04:49:45] <hellyeah> humm
[04:49:53] <taplar> probably should have left that off.  anyway, it's a function, not a parameter to dialog
[04:49:56] <taplar> it seems
[04:49:57] <hellyeah> so position does not belong to function "dialog"
[04:50:03] <hellyeah> humm
[04:50:05] <taplar> no, it is a function itself
[04:50:20] <hellyeah> do i need to close dialog() before using position?
[04:50:40] <taplar> no, you just need to call position off of the jquery object you want to do the positioning on
[04:51:06] <hellyeah> i respect if you dont answer my question ho can i do that?
[04:51:22] <taplar> which, yeah, would probably have to happen outside of that initialization
[04:52:21] <shoky> dialog does have a position option
[04:52:31] <shoky> hellyeah: what's the problem with the fiddle?
[04:53:09] <taplar> oh?  that takes the same arguments as the $.position function?
[04:53:26] <shoky> yeah
[04:53:34] <taplar> huh, my bad, :s
[04:53:38] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[04:53:56] <hellyeah> shoky:  pls check line 82-86 it doesnt work as expected https://jqueryui.com/position/#default
[04:54:08] <hellyeah> it needs to be in the bottom
[04:54:13] <hellyeah> bottom and center
[04:54:22] <hellyeah> click image button on the table
[04:54:24] <shoky> hellyeah: well one problem is you're passing event for the "of" property. you should have e as argument to the click callback and pass e
[04:54:42] <shoky> it only works because some browsers have that legacy global "event" property
[04:54:59] <hellyeah> you mean this     $("#button").css('background-color', color).on('click', function (e)
[04:55:00] <shoky> hellyeah: you're doing  of: event  so it puts it relative to where the click was
[04:55:15] <shoky> yes that kind of e
[04:55:33] <shoky> why are you doing  of: event  ?
[04:55:51] <hellyeah> i dont know that part
[04:56:01] <shoky> ok then don't say it doesn't work as expected ;)
[04:56:01] <hellyeah> i mean
[04:56:03] <hellyeah> i am not sure
[04:56:18] <hellyeah> pop up appear after clicking button
[04:56:20] <shoky> where do you want it to be
[04:56:22] <hellyeah> so it is an event
[04:56:30] <hellyeah> thats why i wrote event there
[04:56:36] <shoky> yes but   of: event  means  position it relative to where the click was...
[04:56:37] <hellyeah> shoky:  in the bottom and center
[04:56:42] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/ec5mvm4t/5/
[04:56:45] <hellyeah> ic
[04:56:52] <abailarri> Cork, I'm seeing that my response always comes with <a href=""></a>. For example in the php file I have return 'success', then in the ajax response I have <a href=""></a>success. What can be?
[04:57:16] <hellyeah> $('body') hmm
[04:57:19] <shoky> hellyeah try   of: window
[04:57:21] <Cork> abailarri: the server adds something to the content
[04:58:59] <hellyeah> a sec
[04:59:09] <shoky> hellyeah:  if you want it on the center bottom of the window
[04:59:21] <shoky> hellyeah: then:     my: "center bottom", at: "center bottom", of: window
[04:59:26] <abailarri> Cork, I deleted the return line. Now thare are only the ajax call and in the response appears again the <a href=""></a>
[04:59:43] <abailarri> The, in what level of server is happening this?
[04:59:53] <shoky> well,  window is the default so you can omit "of" if using window
[05:00:23] <Cork> abailarri: that depends on the server and not something i can answer
[05:02:37] <abailarri> Cork, I founded the error. A string introduced by error typing
[05:02:39] <abailarri> thanks
[05:11:05] <hellyeah> shoky:  still there
[05:11:10] <hellyeah> just one more question?
[05:11:48] <taplar> ask as many as you want, :)
[05:11:56] <hellyeah> line 134 and 135 it worked as expected http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/23/ but not work when you are in full screen https://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/23/embedded/result/
[05:12:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  thanks :XD
[05:14:47] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:14:49] <taplar> some reason in full screen i get an error in console that dialog is not defined
[05:14:50] <hellyeah> i saw my mistake
[05:14:51] <hellyeah> sorry
[05:15:04] <hellyeah> it is because of https
[05:15:08] <taplar> and you got a loop in there?  i got "adf" logging continuously
[05:15:08] <hellyeah> do it http
[05:15:14] <hellyeah> if it is https
[05:15:52] <taplar> k, http worked, still got that looped logging
[05:16:07] <hellyeah> there can be console.log
[05:18:02] <taplar> looks like for your popup you have center top and center top, and still of: event
[05:18:26] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[05:18:41] <taplar> link?
[05:20:45] <taplar> on /25 you have it center bottom and window for popup2, but not the first popup
[05:22:00] <hellyeah> okey it worked i need to position it anyway http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/26/embedded/result/
[05:22:35] <hellyeah> i want to put popup2 to the left side and center
[05:22:50] <hellyeah> i want tput boxContainer to button and center of the page
[05:23:11] <hellyeah> so in that way we can examine the table as well as examine the content of checkboxes without problem
[05:55:38] <notchris> taplar: Got it working!
[05:56:53] <taplar> remind me, what is 'it'?
[05:58:07] <notchris> taplar: Haha sorry, that cart I was building
[05:58:09] <notchris> With the tickets
[05:59:12] <taplar> cool
[05:59:40] <notchris> Except, I have this line
[05:59:40] <notchris> $('span.productTotal').before("$");
[05:59:49] <notchris> And there should only be 3 dollar signs
[05:59:55] <notchris> But its making like, a lot of them lol
[06:00:07] <notchris> And only three spans exist in the console
[06:00:47] <notchris> http://puu.sh/j8xUT/e821a7b4a8.png
[06:01:03] <taplar> woah
[06:01:15] <notchris> Not sure why lol
[06:01:49] <taplar> what is $('span.productTotal').length?
[06:02:04] <notchris> 3
[06:02:54] <taplar> hmm, next thing i would guess at then is the logic that does that is reoccuring multiple times
[06:03:48] <taplar> 11 times it seems, from your image, :)
[06:03:53] <toomus> Hi all
[06:04:08] <taplar> toomus: morning
[06:04:32] <toomus> I have strange .prepend() behavior
[06:05:01] <toomus> Can't figure out why it is executing twice, when called once
[06:05:23] <Cork> toomus: the selector might match two elements?
[06:05:45] <Cork> or you might have $([elm, elm]).prepend('content')
[06:05:50] <notchris> taplar: I just put the $ into the html, seems to work
[06:06:00] <notchris> Guess its better to use less js anyway
[06:06:16] <taplar> nice
[06:06:20] <toomus> Cork: OMG you are right!
[06:06:31] <Cork> heh
[06:06:35] <abishek> how can I get the index of the li for the button that was clicked? http://jsbin.com/nokequ/edit?html,js,console,output
[06:06:42] <taplar> notchris: you could also do something with css if you wanted
[06:06:55] <abishek> sorry, posted the wrong bin http://jsbin.com/gayiti/edit?html,js,output
[06:07:11] <notchris> is .before similar to :before in css?
[06:07:25] <taplar> abishek: get parent() and then you can get the index of that
[06:08:00] <taplar> $(this).parent().index()
[06:08:18] <Cork> notchris: no
[06:08:23] <notchris> OK
[06:08:36] <Cork> notchris: .before inserts the value you give it before the selector element
[06:08:41] <Cork> it has nothing to do with :before
[06:08:49] <notchris> Thought that might be
[06:08:58] <Cork> :before is a psudo class you can't access it with js
[06:11:35] <abishek> taplar, just updated my code on the bin http://jsbin.com/gayiti/2/edit?html,js,console,output . Not working. Am I doing something wrong
[06:12:39] <abishek> taplar, nvm, got it working
[06:12:44] <abishek> silly mistake
[06:12:51] <abishek> :p
[06:13:25] <taplar> sweet, i was fixing to say, i'm missing alot of questions this morning, ~_~
[06:19:56] <jayjo_> Can I use jquery selctors on a variable? I cloned a DOM element with .clone() but I need to 'clear' the fields within it. Can I navigate down from an element?
[06:20:36] <jayjo_> mean I have var newField = $('#selector').clone()
[06:20:54] <jayjo_> can I use Jquery selectors on the variable?
[06:21:51] <jayjo_> I'd liek to do something like $(newField > input)
[06:21:59] <jayjo_> will that work? but one is a string and the other is not
[06:23:27] <taplar> yep
[06:23:50] <taplar> newField.find('selector')
[06:40:23] <hellyeah> hey
[06:40:34] <hellyeah> man it sucks http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/34/embedded/result/ click second row image button and then click first line image button position is changing why is it happened?
[06:45:28] <taplar> alright, got coffee and pushed bug fix.  lets take a look
[06:47:10] <taplar> "second row"  "first line"  are row and line the same thing?
[06:47:19] <taplar> switching up lingo on me if so, :P
[06:48:23] <notchris> If I want to make an object out of text in three tr’s
[06:48:38] <notchris> so that object.type represents each item
[06:48:40] <notchris> How do I do so?
[06:49:06] <taplar> text would be in the tds, not the trs.... ?
[06:49:11] <notchris> True
[06:49:12] <notchris> Sorry
[06:49:39] <notchris> $('tr.product').each(function(){
[06:49:59] <Cork> are you talking about something like $.map(arr, function(obj) { return $('<td>').text(obj.type); }); ?
[06:50:00] <notchris> But how do i set object type as the first td in each tr
[06:50:12] <Cork> uh
[06:50:33] <Cork> i don't follow what you're trying to do...
[06:50:52] <notchris> Say I have an object
[06:50:56] <taplar> each(function(idx, elem){ if (ids == 0) object.type = elem.text() })    perhaps something like that
[06:50:57] <notchris> And I want three objects within
[06:50:59] <notchris> So like
[06:51:04] <taplar> ids = idx
[06:51:35] <taplar> though that looping is still over the trs and not the tds
[06:51:43] <Cork> notchris: do you want to update the object with info from the table?
[06:51:44] <taplar> you'd have to double loop
[06:51:49] <notchris> Yes
[06:51:51] <notchris> Cork: Yes
[06:52:01] <notchris> Each row is an object in one main object
[06:52:04] <notchris> So i can do like
[06:52:11] <notchris> object.row.type =
[06:52:19] <notchris> object.row.othervalue -
[06:52:24] <Cork> ok
[06:52:27] <notchris> There are three rows
[06:52:34] <notchris> The values for each row object should be the tds
[06:52:46] <Cork> do you have the names of the columns somewhere?
[06:53:16] <notchris> Cork: http://puu.sh/j8AxZ/313d0ef457.png
[06:53:40] <Cork> ah
[06:55:06] <notchris> :D
[06:56:28] <Cork> $('tr.product'.each(function(i) { var tds = $(this).find('td'); object[i][tds.eq(0).text().toLocaleLowerCase()] = tds.eq(1).find('input').val(); });
[06:56:33] <Cork> something like that could work
[06:56:46] <Cork> you would have to special case the part that doesn't have an input field though
[06:57:25] <notchris> Ahhh
[06:58:08] <hellyeah> hey
[06:58:24] <hellyeah> i have two modal window one of them effect the position of other.
[06:58:29] <hellyeah> how can i avoid that?
[06:59:02] <hellyeah> hmm http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/34/embedded/result/ click hand button then image button on the table
[06:59:12] <hellyeah> you will see two pop ups properly positioned
[06:59:16] <Cork> hellyeah: the dialog are most likely not position absolute
[06:59:24] <Cork> or position fixed
[06:59:29] <Cork> so they move eachother around
[06:59:35] <hellyeah> close pop up at the buttom
[06:59:46] <hellyeah> you will se other pop up goes up
[06:59:53] <hellyeah> Cork:  i got it
[06:59:59] <hellyeah> but this is kinda of annoying
[07:00:07] <hellyeah> i need to open two pop ups at the same time
[07:01:39] <hellyeah> Cork:  do you have any idea about that?
[07:02:41] <hellyeah> i may set that with flip
[07:04:01] <Cork> hellyeah: like i said the dialog gets position: relative
[07:04:14] <hellyeah> you said fixed
[07:04:16] <Cork> so when things change above them (in the html code) it affects its position
[07:04:24] <Cork> i said what it should be
[07:04:27] <Cork> not what it is
[07:04:36] <Cork> absolute/fixed would solve the problem
[07:04:41] <hellyeah> hmm flipfit solved the issue
[07:04:49] <hellyeah> ic
[07:05:07] <hellyeah> seems flipfit solve the issue too http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/37/embedded/result/
[07:05:29] <Cork> hellyeah: you should prob learn the basics of html, instead of hacking around all the problems you get with js
[07:05:58] <Cork> js should be the last resort when things fail, not the goto solution for everything
[07:06:32] <hellyeah> ic
[07:07:07] <hellyeah> but you cannot change position of jquery ui to absolute or fixed
[07:09:42] <Cork> hellyeah: sure you can
[07:09:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:10:12] <hellyeah> i guess you can add class to dialog
[07:10:21] <Cork> i've built a web windowing system a few years back with jquery ui dialogs :)
[07:10:28] <Cork> it can do A LOT
[07:10:32] <hellyeah> like $("foo").dialogClass("bar")
[07:10:47] <hellyeah> bar is css class right
[07:10:52] <Cork> you could just add an extra css rule
[07:10:55] <hellyeah> yes i saw smt like that
[07:10:57] <Cork> no need to add a class
[07:11:13] <hellyeah> like ui-dialog-titles
[07:11:15] <Cork> meaning, you could fix this without a single line of js
[07:11:17] <hellyeah> or ui-widgets
[07:11:27] <Cork> ui-dialog
[07:11:37] <Cork> it the element you want
[07:11:47] <Cork> ui-widgets is very wide
[07:12:03] <Cork> and will effect every widget in the jquery-ui set
[07:12:21] <hellyeah> a sec
[07:13:14] <hellyeah> ui-dialog-content, ui-widget-content, ui-corner-all
[07:13:33] <hellyeah> i guess i need to find which rule is suitable to add position:absolute
[07:14:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/40/
[07:14:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:14:28] <hellyeah> :D
[07:15:24] <hellyeah> Cork:  i will show you smt
[07:16:14] <hellyeah> check this out http://i.imgur.com/LXiQDUb.png
[07:16:32] <hellyeah> it opened in normal position in second try
[07:23:19] <samssh> I have a click event handler set with $btn.on("click", function(ev) {...}). Firefox and IE11 both return the $btn element (unwrapped, of course) for ev.target. Chrome however is returning a child element of the btn of that child element was clicked. Is this a bug, or just a normal crossbrowser inconsistancy?
[07:24:38] <Cork> samssh: ev.target should always be the clicked element, not the element you bound the event handler on
[07:24:44] <Horacsio> Hi. I need to remove this from the code: ul.tiny-cart li ul.cart_list li.total
[07:24:50] <Cork> use $(this) if you want to target the element with the handler
[07:25:12] <Cork> Horacsio: uh, what makes no sense
[07:25:19] <Cork> remove the string? or what?
[07:25:24] <samssh> Cork, That's what I just changed it to, and I'm about to test is across my browsers.
[07:25:30] <Horacsio> I'm using $("ul.tiny-cart li ul.cart_list li.total").remove(); but it doesnt afect correctly. why not?
[07:26:00] <Cork> Horacsio: you would have to make a jsfiddle with the html you're trying to modify
[07:32:05] <samssh> Cork, Check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/vzcmLun6/ Click on "h3 text" and then "Button only text" in FF and Chrome.
[07:32:30] <Horacsio> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/qbkeypmc/
[07:32:56] <Cork> samssh: ya, it is most likely a webcompat solution excepting how it normally works
[07:33:12] <Cork> samssh: but like i said you should always use this for the element the event handler is bound to
[07:33:27] <Cork> as target is the clicked element, not the one with the event handler
[07:34:13] <Horacsio> I'm not targeting correctly. I know in the jsfiddle isn't the ul, but there is a ul :) there.
[07:34:40] <Cork> Horacsio: there is no elements in the page matching "ul.tiny-cart li ul.cart_list"
[07:34:48] <Cork> so li.total won't be removed
[07:34:54] <samssh> Cork, I feel like that inconsistency could be detrimental in some circumstances.
[07:35:16] <Cork> samssh: you should never ever expect event.target to be the same as this
[07:35:38] <samssh> Cork, Not the same as this, but the same in two of the top browsers.
[07:35:39] <Cork> that is a fatal flaw right there
[07:36:14] <Horacsio> Cork, the full code has it... that's why I've put the ul.tiny-cart li ul.cart_list li.total
[07:37:04] <Cork> samssh: i have a vague memory that there is something special about the click events for button
[07:37:12] <Cork> similarly to how it is for <a> tags
[07:37:19] <Cork> but i fail to remember it right now
[07:37:28] <Cork> so what ie and firefox does is the correct one i THINK
[07:37:37] <Cork> not sure if a modern spec specify that though
[07:37:52] <Cork> Horacsio: well i can't tell why it isn't working in another page
[07:37:58] <samssh> Cork, So, not returning the actual target is correct if it has a button parent?
[07:37:59] <Cork> but in THAT page it is cause of the problem i stated
[07:38:14] <Cork> samssh: i think so, but i don't remember
[07:38:22] <samssh> Weird
[07:38:26] <Horacsio> but this jquery code would work if I do the correct reference, right?
[07:38:27] <Cork> you would have to dig through the list of exceptions in the whatwg list
[07:38:41] <Cork> Horacsio: yes
[07:38:51] <Cork> the selector IS the problem
[07:38:57] <Horacsio> ok :)
[07:39:00] <Horacsio> thank you
[07:39:13] <samssh> It seems like something that jQuery would force to be the same, especially since there isn't any documentation about the inconsistency on the event.target page.
[07:39:17] <Horacsio> and the code accept nested things too, right?
[07:39:50] <Cork> samssh: jquery doesn't document all the differences pages have
[07:39:55] <Cork> uh...
[07:39:58] <Cork> *brosers*
[07:40:12] <arc_> o_O
[07:40:12] <Cork> Horacsio: not sure what you mean
[07:40:32] <Cork> that list would be... long and ever changing
[07:40:53] <Horacsio> no it's a fixed list
[07:40:59] <Cork> lol
[07:41:08] <Cork> that list would be... long and ever changing <-- this was for samssh :)
[07:41:23] <Cork> forgot to prefix it
[07:41:28] <Horacsio> sorry :)
[07:41:34] <Cork> no it was my mistake
[07:41:49] <samssh> I suppose.
[07:42:07] <Horacsio> Cork: http://suavedemo.commercegurus.com/shop/ add an item to the cart and roll over the cart icon. I want to remove that subtotal.
[07:42:11] <Horacsio> Please :)
[07:51:04] <Horacsio> Cork: did you manage to take a look at that link?
[07:51:22] <Cork> i couldn't find how to add anything to the cart from that page no
[07:51:28] <Cork> and i don't have the time to dig around
[07:54:54] <Horacsio> ok thank you anyway :)
[07:57:50] <hellyeah> Cork:
[07:57:52] <hellyeah> still there?
[07:58:02] <hellyeah> what do you think? Can you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/51/embedded/result/
[07:58:20] <hellyeah> click animated button then click hand icon button and image button on the table
[07:58:31] <naftilos76> Hi, i have a list of table rows which are setup to be highlighted when mousedown/over/up take place. If i want to dynamically create such an event, would this be the one: $("#database_cp").mousedown();
[07:58:50] <naftilos76> supposing the id of the row is database_cp
[07:59:00] <hellyeah> umm
[07:59:44] <hellyeah> i guess still need to play for positioning
[07:59:53] <hellyeah> sometimes it still effects that
[08:10:34] <hellyeah> effect is the reason of chagning position damn
[08:10:43] <hellyeah> no
[08:10:45] <hellyeah> damn
[08:19:19] <Dr-007> in one javascript document im binding a jquery google maps search function to a textfield like so: $('input[name=google_maps_search]').geocomplete().bind("geocode:result"
[08:19:40] <Dr-007> in another javascript document i'd also like to 'view' the result data
[08:19:57] <Dr-007> im not sure what i'm looking for (to google)
[08:20:02] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[08:20:36] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to show whatever happens with you trigger $('input[name=google_maps_search]').geocomplete().bind("geocode:result" ?
[08:21:22] <Dr-007> in another document, yes.
[08:21:39] <robertmaxrees> then do all the setup and trigger it.
[08:21:52] <Dr-007> but then it is binded twice
[08:21:58] <robertmaxrees> no - it's bound once.
[08:22:02] <robertmaxrees> two separate documents.
[08:22:25] <Dr-007> ah nice
[08:22:29] <Dr-007> thanks :)
[08:37:36] <pedda> hi there someone from spain around?
[08:38:16] <robertmaxrees> pedda there a particular reason you can't just ask your question to the channel?
[08:38:41] <pedda> i want to know which satellite is needed to get spanisch tv channels ;)
[08:38:54] <pedda> that's why i'm asking for someone from spain
[08:38:55] <robertmaxrees> pedda lol not the right place to have that conversation :)
[08:38:56] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[08:39:02] <pedda> maybe you're wrong
[08:39:04] <pedda> ;)
[08:39:06] <robertmaxrees> actually i'm not.
[08:39:16] <pedda> 708 users..
[08:39:24] <robertmaxrees> topic is jquery.
[08:39:25] <pedda> it is OT actually, but not wrong though ^^
[08:39:32] <robertmaxrees> actually it is wrong :)
[08:39:42] <robertmaxrees> has nothing to do with the channel or general subject matter.
[08:39:55] <pedda> shall i start pasting messages i can see in my current window which are also OT in this chan?
[08:40:08] <pedda> doesn't matter..
[08:40:17] <pedda> no need for further discussion
[09:19:03] <skullcrasher> how can I wait until the .append(xxxxxx) is finished and then do something else (on an other element)?
[09:19:58] <skullcrasher> there is no callback in the append function that could help me
[09:20:10] <taplar> append is a blocking function
[09:20:17] <taplar> it's not async
[09:20:28] <skullcrasher> ok, so just do other stuff after it
[09:20:32] <taplar> yup
[09:20:35] <skullcrasher> too simple xD -.-
[09:20:38] <skullcrasher> damn
[09:20:40] <skullcrasher> thx
[09:20:45] <taplar> psyching your self out, ;)
[09:21:27] <skullcrasher> :p
[09:33:40] <oniMaker> Is there a simple way to remove all events in a certain namespace from all elements in the DOM?
[09:35:40] <taplar> oniMaker: look at $.off and $.unbind
[09:36:01] <taplar> ?api off
[09:36:08] <oniMaker> taplar: do those apply to the entire DOM?
[09:36:09] <taplar> !g jquery off
[09:36:31] <taplar> whatever your selector is
[09:36:37] <taplar> !g jquery unbind
[09:36:41] <taplar> grrr
[09:36:50] <taplar> !api off
[09:37:03] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[09:37:12] <oniMaker> taplar: you didn't understand the question then
[09:37:13] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[09:37:27] <oniMaker> you can stop, I understand what off and unbind do
[09:38:03] <shoky> $('*') selects all elements
[09:38:19] <oniMaker> shoky: how performant is that though?
[09:38:26] <shoky> it's not
[09:38:35] <shoky> it should never be used
[09:38:46] <oniMaker> obviously jQuery just stores the event bindings in an object or array somewhere
[09:38:50] <oniMaker> so I should be able to unbind them
[09:41:58] <oniMaker> it's definitely in jQuery.cache at least
[09:42:23] <taplar> just seems like a smell.  like, I don't know where all my binds are, so i'm just going to remove them all
[09:42:41] <shoky> yes jquery stores info about event bindings in its per-element private data cache
[09:43:10] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I have a hidden input. I change the value like so: $('#person_id').val(suggestion.id); After, if I try to console.log the value, it shows the correct number. But when I inspect the element, it has no value. There is only one $("#person_id") on the page. Anyone deal with this before?
[09:43:31] <taplar> val will update the dom, not the markup i believe
[09:43:45] <shoky> Scriptonaut: inspecting the element is not supposed to show its runtime value
[09:44:02] <oniMaker> hah, removing the element from $.cache will turn off the event handler
[09:44:15] <shoky> yes, that's what .off does
[09:44:27] <Scriptonaut> shoky: you sure? It usually updates accordingly for me, the inspector I use does anyways. Either way, I know the value isn't being set because when I submit the form the param is missing
[09:44:33] <Scriptonaut> well, it's there, but it's an empty string
[09:44:41] <oniMaker> shoky: except .off requires you to know the element, or select each one of them
[09:44:47] <oniMaker> iterating through the cache array is fast
[09:44:52] <oniMaker> *object
[09:45:01] <taplar> lol, so oniMaker is after an offAll, :)
[09:45:04] <shoky> Scriptonaut: you said it shows fine when you console.log it.. so check what happens between then and losing the value ;p
[09:45:14] <Scriptonaut> ah, alright
[09:48:43] <Scriptonaut> shouldn't $("#person_id") get the same input as $("input[id='person_id']")?
[09:48:51] <Scriptonaut> because the first returns a single input, the second returns 3
[09:48:57] <taplar> unless it's not on an input
[09:49:00] <shoky> if it's an input and there's only one with that id
[09:49:06] <Scriptonaut> there's 3 with the id
[09:49:12] <taplar> invalid markup
[09:49:13] <notchris> how do I append something to the body n times
[09:49:14] <shoky> then stop asking questions and fix that
[09:49:56] <taplar> notchris: what is your 'something' ?
[09:49:59] <taplar> simple string?
[09:50:08] <notchris> Say I wanted to append <p>
[09:50:20] <notchris> But I want the id to increase each time without count
[09:50:46] <notchris> do i use for?
[09:51:40] <taplar> ok
[09:51:43] <taplar> appending to the same element?
[09:51:43] <notchris> Like I want to do an each
[09:51:50] <notchris> but without a set index
[09:51:59] <notchris> So say I want to append <p> 6 times to the bod
[09:52:00] <notchris> body
[09:52:11] <notchris> But each time <p id=“1”></p>
[09:52:19] <notchris> <p id=“2”></p>
[09:52:22] <notchris> ect..
[09:53:32] <taplar> doing an each with index would get you the incrementing number
[09:53:40] <notchris> so like
[09:53:59] <notchris> .each(function(i<6)
[09:54:00] <notchris> ??
[09:54:06] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[09:54:19] <taplar> look at the first example
[09:54:46] <taplar> to dummy an array to loop over you could do $(Array(n))
[09:54:59] <taplar> or something
[09:55:01] <notchris> Hmm
[09:55:05] <notchris> Now im confused
[09:55:09] <taplar> one sec
[09:56:54] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/bhsv4L5j/
[09:57:39] <notchris> Got it!
[09:58:26] <notchris> Thank you taplar
[09:58:35] <taplar> np
[09:58:45] <taplar> though might i suggest something

[10:09:31] <notchris> See what I mean?
[10:09:40] <taplar> ohhh
[10:09:45] <taplar> heh hold on
[10:12:34] <notchris> <3
[10:13:35] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/bhsv4L5j/2/
[10:16:52] <notchris> ty taplar  :)
[10:24:09] <decx> Array(5) really?
[10:24:16] <taplar> *shrug* easier way?
[10:24:24] <decx> for :p
[10:25:08] <decx> also, append will actually do appendChild 5 times :>
[10:25:39] <taplar> so it doesn't limit the redraws?
[10:25:51] <decx> i don't think so
[10:25:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:25:58] <decx> it's probably still faster
[10:26:06] <taplar> well dang, lol, whole reason i recommend that
[10:26:07] <robertmaxrees> it does an internal .each() and just goes.
[10:26:14] <robertmaxrees> what was the reccomendation?
[10:26:24] <decx> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.append
[10:26:26] <taplar> appending once with a list rather than singles multiple times
[10:26:30] <decx> domManip is the kicker
[10:26:34] <decx> click that
[10:26:57] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do a single append instead of 5, use a fragment or a jquery object instead.
[10:27:45] <taplar> ah
[10:28:06] <taplar> would it still be five if you did that but appended $fragment.children()
[10:28:36] <decx> sadly there is no direct equal to document.createDocumentFragment()
[10:28:41] <decx> iirc
[10:28:47] <robertmaxrees> with fragments, you don't specifcy the children - that's exactly what it does already anyway.
[10:29:41] <taplar> well, but with a fragment you need a parent right?  so like a dummy span or something.  but then when you append it you wouldn't want that as it was just for your collection
[10:29:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:29:53] <robertmaxrees> documentFragment IS the parent.
[10:30:05] <taplar> ah
[10:30:15] <taplar> gotcha gotcha, never used that
[10:30:48] <taplar> gotta file that away in the mem
[10:33:30] <decx> hm
[10:33:38] <decx> maybe it does with arrays
[10:33:50] <decx> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=2.0.3&fn=domManip calls buildFragment
[10:34:11] <decx> which creates a fragment
[10:34:26] <robertmaxrees> si.
[12:10:13] <JSPractice> hello. I'm looking for help with replicating a site for practice
[12:10:45] <JSPractice> so far I've learnt html/css, javascript and jquery. and i found a site that uses all of it so it's great for practice
[12:12:37] <JSPractice> anyway, I want to know how to use .sortable() such that the <tr> in the list are only sortable within their respective <th>s
[12:12:37] <taplar> what's the question?
[12:13:50] <taplar> have you reviewed the api?
[12:14:29] <JSPractice> taplar: I want to know how to use .sortable() such that the <tr> in the list are only sortable within their respective <th>s
[12:15:44] <taplar> right, sortable works over your selectors returned collection i believe
[12:15:57] <taplar> and just to make sure, th's belong to trs, not other way around
[12:16:54] <taplar> here is the api if you haven't found this yet for exploration too http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/
[12:17:02] <BytesAndCoffee> What's the best way to parse a html fragment string (like a div with a list inside) to a proper, insertable DOM node?
[12:17:25] <BytesAndCoffee> Just pass it in as innerHTML?
[12:17:36] <taplar> BytesAndCoffee: you can directly append it if you want
[12:17:54] <taplar> BytesAndCoffee: or stick it between $()
[12:18:13] <BytesAndCoffee> what's fastest/most efficient
[12:18:34] <BytesAndCoffee> Also, I'm glad Cordova is a thing
[12:18:35] <taplar> append would be fine.  doing $() is useful if you want to save it to a variable and manipulate it first
[12:19:26] <BytesAndCoffee> So just pass it in through .child() or .innerHTML?
[12:19:43] <taplar> $(parentElementSelector).append(htmlString)
[12:19:49] <BytesAndCoffee> Ah
[12:20:13] <BytesAndCoffee> What if I want to replace what's there
[12:20:23] <taplar> $(parentElementSelector).html(htmlString)
[12:20:39] <BytesAndCoffee> Ah
[12:20:43] <BytesAndCoffee> Thanks
[12:20:49] <taplar> np
[12:21:45] <BytesAndCoffee> Now if only I could figure out how to serve the project to my phone without having to rebuild the app and installing ovef adb
[12:21:59] <BytesAndCoffee> But this is the wrong channel
[12:37:47] <ceramicskull> Is there a way to insert a script into the head before the page finishes loading?
[12:41:08] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/
[12:59:18] <taplar> i'm outie, have a good evening all
[13:02:16] <JSPractice> hi. how do i point to a div in jquery?
[13:02:28] <JSPractice> in the sense, i want something to happen when the mouse is taken away from this.div
[13:02:44] <DarkElement> Hey guys how can I flip an element to show another element on hover? Been trying to figure out this guy:https://github.com/nnattawat/flip but with no luck
[13:21:44] <sdubois_> i am swapping an img src with jquery on mouseover. is there anyway i can have this change animate with a fade?
[13:22:02] <sdubois_> i have img src and img alt-src and i just swap them
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> sdubois_ you need to have two elements to fade between
[13:24:30] <robertmaxrees> JSPractice check out event listeners, .on() and the mouseout event
[13:25:56] <JSPractice> hi robertmaxrees . I'm doing a bit of reading and I have a good idea of what functions i have to use, but i don't know how to write them properly
[13:25:59] <JSPractice> can you help me?
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> JSPractice check out the jquery learning center :)
[13:27:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm about to bounce for a meeting but that should give you everything you need - learn.jquery.com
[13:27:36] <JSPractice> i did a course on codeacademy
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> Great!  the jquery learning center will get you up to speed on jquery.
[13:27:50] <JSPractice> i'm doing this for practice and i'm stuck. i tried looking for help online but i can't get it
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle and i'll see if i can't help you before i leave./
[13:28:11] <JSPractice> okay give me two minutes please
[13:28:18] <robertmaxrees> lol my meeting is in two minutes.
[13:28:59] <JSPractice> how do i assign an auto generated ID to a div tag?
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id', theNewID);
[13:29:15] <JSPractice> ah. okay i'll catch you later maybe. thanks anyway
[13:29:25] <robertmaxrees> then $('#theNewID').on('mouseleave', function() {});
[13:29:31] <JSPractice> oh yeah. okay thanks!
[13:29:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, make a fiddle and share that out to the room somebody else might be able to help.
[13:30:08] <JSPractice> cool. i'll try that
[13:30:09] <JSPractice> thanks!
[13:30:16] <qakhan> i am getting dropdown selected values through php and $.post() jquery.
[13:30:24] <qakhan>  i can get selected value and dispaly on page.
[13:30:44] <qakhan> i am getting value in a div. but when i get value in div it get all the above divs in it.
[13:30:52] <qakhan> here is my code http://pastebin.com/4teLv6q3
[13:37:28] <NoiseEee> qakhan: not a helpful pastebin
[13:39:23] <NoiseEee> qakhan: pastebin the *rendered* page (no PHP) and a better description of your problem
[13:40:00] <JSPractice> can someone explain the meaning of this to me? "This event is triggered during sorting, but only when the DOM position has changed."
[13:40:36] <JSPractice> what do you mean DOM *position* has changed?
[13:41:11] <qakhan> NoiseEee i have dropdown meun in <div id="total"> i am getting selected value of dropdown menu through $.post() and i want to show return value in <div id="total">
[13:41:42] <NoiseEee> qakhan: but you already have a bunch of markup in <div id='total'>, that will be overwritten
[13:42:35] <xochilpili> hi all
[13:42:43] <NoiseEee> qakhan: and I have no idea what lines 38-40 do, but they don't do anything good
[13:42:50] <xochilpili> im having issues with jstree is this a good place to post my questions?
[13:43:41] <qakhan> NoiseEee line 38-40 just printing selected value
[13:43:56] <qakhan> i will use that value to query in db
[13:44:15] <NoiseEee> qakhan: uh ok, but never write to php superglobals.  they are for reading.
[13:44:15] <JSPractice> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable
[13:44:31] <JSPractice> I need help understanding a few functions from http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable
[13:44:41] <JSPractice> many of them sound similar
[13:45:06] <qakhan> is there any way i can remove all divs in return
[13:45:37] <JSPractice> if my sortable <li> from one <th> is moved into another sortable <th>, which event should be triggered?
[13:45:50] <NoiseEee> qakhan: what do you mean?
[13:46:09] <xochilpili> anyone?
[13:46:25] <NoiseEee> xochilpili: you can try, maybe someone here uses the plugin <shrug>
[13:46:28] <qakhan> currently when i get value <div id="total"> get all html in it.
[13:47:03] <NoiseEee> qakhan: what?
[13:47:03] <qakhan> is there any way i can remove all html and show only selected value in <div id="total">
[13:47:15] <ceramicskull> NoiseEee do you understand what I'm trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/x5kukjbg/1/
[13:47:53] <NoiseEee> qakhan:  if you want to retrieve something specifically, put is somewhere where only that thing is.
[13:48:04] <NoiseEee> qakhan: having difficulty understanding what you're doing.
[13:48:45] <qakhan> NoiseEee do you understand this $('#total').html(data);
[13:48:46] <qakhan> ?
[13:49:16] <NoiseEee> qakhan: yes, that writes html markup (data) to the div id "total"
[13:49:28] <xochilpili> http://hastebin.com/cenokawoco.coffee
[13:49:44] <NoiseEee> qakhan: which seems a long way off from your question
[13:50:00] <xochilpili> this is my example, im trying to load another ajax call once a node was selected, to return all childs in that node...
[13:50:26] <qakhan> so in <div id="total"> i will get result of $('#total').html(data);
[13:50:28] <qakhan> right?
[13:50:55] <NoiseEee> qakhan: you will OVERWRITE any content in <div id='total'> with data
[13:51:17] <qakhan> here we go
[13:51:44] <qakhan> that is my question. i dont want to do that
[13:51:47] <NoiseEee> why don't you put your "data" somewhere specifically made for it, rather than overwriting markup and changing the meaning of <div id='data'>
[13:52:03] <NoiseEee> qakhan: what is it you wish to do then.
[13:54:04] <qakhan> i want to have 1 div which will have dropdown menu. if user select any option from dropdown menu, i want to show it in the same div next to dropdown menu
[13:54:28] <qakhan> i hope it will clear my question
[13:55:14] <NoiseEee> qakhan: so create another element that will hold it.
[13:55:40] <NoiseEee> qakhan: ie: after your </select>,   put <span id='theValue'></span>
[13:55:52] <NoiseEee> and then you can $('#theValue').html(data)
[13:56:01] <NoiseEee> (assuming 'data' is what you want to show)
[13:56:10] <xochilpili> anyone?
[13:58:06] <ceramicskull> xochilpili I would, but I just started learning json and having troubles myself :D
[13:58:35] <xochilpili> ceramicskull, can i help?
[13:59:26] <ceramicskull> maybe? :l http://jsfiddle.net/x5kukjbg/1/ I'm trying to stop results.goal_name from repeating itself for each result in my CSV
[13:59:56] <ceramicskull> I got the pseudo done but I dk how to merge or fix what I have with it
[14:00:06] <qakhan> NoiseEee it is same
[14:00:48] <qakhan> it is getting all html element in it
[14:01:21] <NoiseEee> qakhan: pastebin your code or something
[14:02:49] <qakhan> here
[14:02:51] <qakhan> http://pastebin.com/dcqmStCe
[14:03:07] <NoiseEee> qakhan: mixing PHP in does not help
[14:03:13] <qakhan> is there any way i can host my code and you can run it online
[14:03:43] <qakhan> php is just saving the value in variable
[14:03:57] <NoiseEee> who cares, paste the RENDERED page
[14:04:31] <NoiseEee> so right now, somebody changes the <select> element, you post the value over XHR and then you want to fill #theValue with the server response from the .post?
[14:08:49] <qakhan> NoiseEee what do you need?
[14:09:22] <NoiseEee> pastebin the "view source" somewhere
[14:09:43] <qakhan> here http://pastebin.com/dcqmStCe
[14:10:30] <NoiseEee> that still isn't the browsers view-source
[14:10:40] <NoiseEee> qakhan: this is like pulling teeth
[14:11:43] <qakhan> do you know any website where i can post it
[14:11:55] <xochilpili> someone?
[14:12:51] <NoiseEee> qakhan: dude.
[14:13:16] <NoiseEee> qakhan: open your script in a browser, hit "view source" and paste it
[14:13:30] <NoiseEee> qakhan: you DO have a server where you're testing that file, don't you?
[14:14:04] <oniMaker> why does an unchecked checkbox return its value when I call .val() ?
[14:14:13] <oniMaker> shouldn't it return undefined?
[14:14:22] <NoiseEee> its giving you the value
[14:14:35] <NoiseEee> it still has a value, checked or not
[14:15:25] <NoiseEee> and with that, i'm out
[14:15:41] <oniMaker> how can I get the value that would be submitted to a server on post?
[14:15:54] <oniMaker> i.e. undefined if it isn't checked
[14:16:06] <oniMaker> is there a function for that, or not?
[14:16:28] <NoiseEee_> oniMaker: unchecked boxes aren't sent, so perhaps if your input type is a checkbox, look for the "checked" property before you seek its value, otherwise make it undefined
[14:16:45] <oniMaker> yeah, was hoping there was a builtin
[14:16:59] <qakhan> NoiseEee here http://pastebin.com/gsevr3n0
[14:17:05] <NoiseEee_> if(myCheckbox.is(':checked')) { //it is checked } else { //somethig about undefined }   @ oniMaker
[14:17:20] <oniMaker> NoiseEee_: was hoping to avoid special cases for various inputs
[14:19:30] <oniMaker> ah, I can use serializeArray
[14:21:09] <xochilpili> oniMaker, $('#formID').serializeAll();
[14:21:24] <oniMaker> xochilpili: nah, I just want the individual input in this case
[14:21:26] <xochilpili> or var data=$('#idForm').serializeAll();
[14:21:45] <paulvd> hello, I am trying to check a radio box, based on a value, trying jQuery('input[type=radio][value=' + turn + ']').attr('checked', true); but it shows an error "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[type=radio][value=$100,001 - $150,000]
[14:21:45] <paulvd> 	
[14:21:45] <paulvd> "
[14:21:48] <oniMaker> serializeAll() is not a function, is it?
[14:21:52] <oniMaker> serializeArray() is
[14:40:31] <raj> can I modify the content-type of a page?
[14:41:30] <oniMaker> raj: content-type is a header sent from the server
[14:41:32] <Cyberuben> Could anyone please let me know why I'm getting the error "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).slimbox is not a function" on the following page? http://www.dev.hegeman-audio-video.nl/bang-olufsen/ipod-iphone-ipad/10-beoplay/P18-beoplay-a9-wit-wifi-blue-tooth
[14:42:02] <raj> oniMaker, and can I modify it with jquery or js?
[14:42:12] <raj> I have a chrome extension that does it, as well as a ff extension
[14:42:24] <raj> so I figure js can do it
[14:43:25] <oniMaker> that logic doesn't quite follow
[14:44:13] <raj> the extension doesn't have access to the server, of course
[14:44:18] <raj> so how is the extension doing it?
[14:44:59] <oniMaker> I would assume browser extensions have access to much more than the js vm
[14:46:00] <raj> I thought extensions can only do what userscripts can anyway do
[14:46:58] <oniMaker> time for some research I guess
[14:47:00] <raj> oniMaker, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13700394/how-to-change-response-header-in-chrome
[14:47:06] <raj> that's JS
[14:47:39] <oniMaker> and specific to chrome it looks like
[14:48:06] <raj> yes, I'm only concerned about writing a userscript in chrome anyway
[14:50:39] <oniMaker> there you go then, you were able to google it after all
[14:57:11] <xochilpili> anyhand?
[14:57:43] <xochilpili> im still trying to load children of a pre-selected node using getJSON in jsTree plugin.
[14:57:44] <ceramicskull> xochilpili were you able to take a look at mine? :l
[14:58:11] <xochilpili> ceramicskull, repost
[14:58:32] <raj> oniMaker, still wondering how that would go into a userscript
[14:58:32] <ceramicskull> http://jsfiddle.net/x5kukjbg/1/
[14:58:55] <xochilpili> ceramicskull, what about it?
[14:58:58] <ceramicskull> xochilpili: just trying to get results.goal_name to not repeat if duplicated
[14:59:27] <ceramicskull> i have the pseudo but dk how to merge it with what I have already
[15:00:12] <xochilpili> how do you get the data?
[15:00:28] <ceramicskull> from a json
[15:01:03] <ceramicskull> like I said, i'm still learning so I'm lost at this point
[15:01:07] <xochilpili> ceramicskull, yes, but how; from php ?
[15:01:19] <ceramicskull> no ajax
[15:01:41] <xochilpili> ceramicskull, i cant see the call
[15:02:15] <ceramicskull> Yea I know, but I have everything working fine, I just want to stop duplicates from printing in my csv
[15:02:55] <xochilpili> ceramicskull, well, that pseudo doesnt mean anything to me
[15:03:15] <ceramicskull> D:
[15:03:19] <BytesAndCoffee> How would I make something like this, where you flick left and right to select different options http://imgur.com/SajSMIj
[15:03:57] <robertmaxrees> hammer.js
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> a touch-friendly carousel.
[15:04:44] <ceramicskull> heyo robert
[15:10:02] <BytesAndCoffee> robertmaxrees: thanks, found this
[15:10:04] <BytesAndCoffee> http://codepen.io/2ne/pen/Lueit/
[15:11:58] <Cyberuben> <Cyberuben> Could anyone please let me know why I'm getting the error "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).slimbox is not a function" on the following page? http://www.dev.hegeman-audio-video.nl/bang-olufsen/ipod-iphone-ipad/10-beoplay/P18-beoplay-a9-wit-wifi-blue-tooth
[15:13:44] <robertmaxrees> Cyberuben that sounds like you tried to use the plugin before you included it.
[15:14:13] <Cyberuben> robertmaxrees: It's within a $(document).ready()...?
[15:14:13] <robertmaxrees> or you're including jquery twice.
[15:14:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really matter fwiw.
[15:14:33] <Cyberuben> Yeah it's probably including jQuery twice. This website is a clusterfuck, I just need to get it working
[15:15:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah you have jquery on there twice.
[15:15:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove one.
[15:15:27] <robertmaxrees> remove the second one.
[15:15:59] <Cyberuben> I'm quite sure that'll break a lot of things, let me see
[15:16:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:16:08] <robertmaxrees> you think it will, but it won't.
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> it's 1.11.2 vs 1.11.3
[15:16:29] <Cyberuben> I see
[15:21:43] <shoky> oi raj
[15:21:52] <Cyberuben> robertmaxrees: Thanks, it works now
[15:22:14] <ceramicskull> shoky since you've kinda helped me out with this in the past, think you can look over this and tell me what I can do in order to not have it duplicate the value of the key goal_name? I just want it to not duplicate the key and merge the values http://jsfiddle.net/x5kukjbg/
[15:22:29] <raj> wow, shoky, good to see you
[15:22:43] <shoky> you too ;]
[15:23:01] <shoky> nice when they let you out of the hospital
[15:23:21] <raj> not really
[15:23:28] <shoky> lemme know if ya need helkp with that chrome thing ;p
[15:23:32] <raj> I've definitely got munchausen's
[15:23:36] <shoky> hah
[15:23:43] <raj> don't really know how to act in society anymore
[15:24:17] <raj> woops
[15:24:22] <raj> I meant stockholm
[15:24:32] <raj> see what I mean
[15:24:59] <shoky> i always do
[15:25:14] <raj> and only you
[15:26:02] <arc_> does anybody know what is actually in chrome 44 or someplace that summarizes it
[15:26:15] <arc_> i heard it's supposed to reduce memory usage but i haven't really seen that to be the case
[15:27:48] <raj> I stopped believing that a long time ago
[15:28:00] <shoky> ceramicskull: not sure what you mean..  and why are you assigning to csvExport the returned value from $.each  that's not doing much
[15:28:04] <raj> they seem to have a perpetual rumor about reducing memory usage
[15:28:15] <arc_> i don't really care about it for myself but it would be nice to stop hearing people complain about it
[15:28:37] <shoky> arc_: the loading tab animation is a bit different. more like material design crap. yay us :\
[15:28:41] <raj> why? it's a legitimate complaint
[15:29:26] <arc_> it may be, but i still don't like reading about it :p
[15:29:43] <shoky> and, very subjective, but this is the first chrome release in a long time where i feel like performance has improved, as opposed to recent google where it just gets uglier and bulkier
[15:29:57] <arc_> i haven't really noticed any difference
[15:30:09] <arc_> what do you mean when you say loading tab animation
[15:30:21] <shoky> the spinner thing
[15:30:32] <shoky> where the favicon is, while the tab is loading
[15:31:15] <arc_> i don't remember what it looked like before. if i had to guess i would say that it's the same, only now it also shows a blue icon that goes the opposite direction
[15:31:22] <ceramicskull> shoky: I'm assigning it because I use the result of it to push into a CSV afterwards. Currently, when I export the value of goal_name gets returned but I have duplicates for each result. I rather just have goal_name returned once if there is duplicates and then merge the results into new lines.
[15:32:14] <shoky> ceramicskull: the docs for $.each say it just returns whatever you passed as first argument. so you're not gaining anything by this assigning
[15:33:19] <shoky> ceramicskull: put example data in the fiddle or somth.. i donno what duplicates you mean exactly
[15:33:28] <shoky> show the problem
[15:36:59] <ceramicskull> its just duplicates in the CSV
[15:37:07] <ceramicskull> I get the result of each object in a CSV
[15:37:46] <ceramicskull> but in each object it brings goal_name
[15:39:23] <ryein> if i create a jquery function how can i execute it?
[15:39:33] <ryein> $.myfunction(); ?
[15:39:41] <ceramicskull> now goal_name value may have duplicates, I rather just print it once in the CSV vs 6 times and just merge the rest of the results of the object under said goal name
[15:39:54] <robertmaxrees> ryanneufeld huh?
[15:40:00] <robertmaxrees> err, ryein
[15:40:02] <robertmaxrees> "a jquery function"??
[15:45:59] <robertmaxrees> ryein what do you mean a "jquery function"
[15:48:14] <ryein> how can i create a function where i can use jquery ajax request that can be used else where in my js file?
[15:48:44] <ryein> i keep getting function not defined
[15:48:50] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've got.
[15:51:18] <ryein> oh i see you gotta create the function outside of doucment ready function
[15:52:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:52:12] <robertmaxrees> you can create it inside of there.
[15:52:18] <robertmaxrees> unless you're trying to use it outside
[15:52:42] <ryein> robertmaxrees: yeah i am
[15:52:52] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, welcome to scope.
[15:52:58] <ryein> im trying to do another ajax request after one already completed
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> deferreds.
[15:53:05] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[15:53:24] <ryein> after i do the first one i get a 500 error for cross domain
[15:53:34] <ryein> but it is on the same domain
[15:53:45] <robertmaxrees> same port and protocol and subdomain, too?
[15:53:58] <ryein> the first one is a stripe request
[15:54:05] <ryein> and the second is my domain
[15:54:07] <ryein> the first works
[15:54:11] <ryein> second fails
[15:54:23] <robertmaxrees> wait you're getting a 500?
[15:54:31] <robertmaxrees> because cross-domain errors are different from 500.
[15:54:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a problem with your server.
[15:57:04] <ryein> robertmaxrees: ok so server side issue thanks
[15:57:11] <robertmaxrees> i assume.  that's what 500 means.
[16:05:37] <ryein> robertmaxrees: yeah my routes in laravel weren't right
[16:05:43] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:15:35] <Dr-007> this simple comparison failing in javascript is driving me crazy. this is my function with its output: http://pastebin.com/mnpUqy7M
[16:15:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:15:57] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle insteaD?
[16:16:07] <Dr-007> im simply trying to compare the type representing the country in my output
[16:16:16] <Dr-007> but somehow  the comparison is failing
[16:16:30] <robertmaxrees> because you're not returning out of find_address_component
[16:16:31] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees, im affraid not
[16:16:43] <Dr-007> i've been splitting the google maps module and some other module
[16:16:48] <robertmaxrees> you're returning out of the callback for $.each()
[16:16:59] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't work like you think it does.
[16:17:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to find?
[16:17:25] <Dr-007> the country in the third Object
[16:17:38] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[16:17:40] <Dr-007> short_name
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> { long_name="Nederland",  short_name="NL",  types=[2]} ?
[16:18:44] <Dr-007> yes thats the one
[16:18:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wus1uk4p/
[16:19:18] <robertmaxrees> so test_object is the full sample object?
[16:19:27] <robertmaxrees> (it's really hard to understand what this code is trying to do.
[16:19:38] <robertmaxrees> because that sample isn't a valid object.
[16:19:59] <Dr-007> no it isnt
[16:20:05] <Dr-007> how do i get one from firebug
[16:20:13] <Dr-007> there's also a types object inthere
[16:20:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean a types property?
[16:20:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wus1uk4p/2/ like this?
[16:20:32] <Dr-007> types
[16:20:32] <Dr-007> 	
[16:20:32] <Dr-007> 	["country", "political"]
[16:20:44] <robertmaxrees> JSON.stringify(theObject);
[16:21:23] <Dr-007> thnx. one moment ill put it inthere
[16:23:15] <Dr-007> http://jsfiddle.net/wus1uk4p/3/
[16:24:04] <Dr-007> or http://jsfiddle.net/wus1uk4p/4/
[16:24:36] <Dr-007> but the second one isn't logging anything either in the output window :s
[16:24:47] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[16:25:29] <Dr-007> aaah
[16:25:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wus1uk4p/6/
[16:25:49] <Dr-007> i thought it would appear in the window on the right
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a small iframe for html/css/dom/etc.
[16:26:14] <robertmaxrees> so what is find_addres_component trying to do?
[16:26:43] <robertmaxrees> you want every object that has a particular type?
[16:26:53] <Dr-007> it should return GB
[16:27:05] <Dr-007> its iterating trought the types object
[16:27:29] <Dr-007> to match the types inside the "country" object
[16:27:36] <Dr-007> errr
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> i see what you want.
[16:27:44] <Dr-007> types object
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> *array
[16:27:51] <Dr-007> gosh
[16:27:55] <Dr-007> im losing it
[16:28:01] <Dr-007> :p
[16:28:06] <robertmaxrees> so part of the problem here is that you can't return out of $.each() like that.
[16:28:14] <Dr-007> aaaah
[16:28:18] <Dr-007> why not?
[16:28:25] <robertmaxrees> because you're returing out of that inner function.
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> which goes nowhere.
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> but the bigger problem is this isn't what you actually want.
[16:29:03] <Dr-007> why not?
[16:29:05] <robertmaxrees> you want to use the native .map() function.
[16:29:15] <robertmaxrees> no need for jquery here.
[16:29:36] <robertmaxrees> you just want the short_name, right?
[16:29:53] <Dr-007> because this seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/wus1uk4p/7/
[16:30:01] <Dr-007> with your advice ofcourse
[16:30:07] <robertmaxrees> thgat's still not what you want.
[16:30:12] <robertmaxrees> one second.
[16:30:13] <Dr-007> ok yes
[16:30:23] <Dr-007> but indeed i want to get the short_name
[16:30:24] <Dr-007> thats right
[16:30:34] <Dr-007> im getting it from a geolocation autocomplete jquery plugin
[16:31:00] <Dr-007> which binds something like this: $('input[name=google_maps_search]').geocomplete().bind("geocode:result", function(event, result){
[16:31:08] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter ;)
[16:31:10] <Dr-007> the result is the actual object
[16:31:17] <Dr-007> ok ok, im curious
[16:32:40] <robertmaxrees> so do you just want the first one that matches?
[16:32:43] <robertmaxrees> or an array of all the matches?
[16:33:21] <Dr-007> the one that gets selected
[16:33:27] <Dr-007> thats whats happening now
[16:33:53] <robertmaxrees> so the way the data is structured suggests that you could get back multiple items with "country" in the types array.
[16:33:58] <robertmaxrees> that's why i ask.
[16:34:30] <Dr-007> ah, uhm i dont know yet
[16:34:32] <Dr-007> so yes the first one
[16:34:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:39] <Dr-007> until someone complains about it :P
[16:35:01] <Dr-007> i havent encountered multiple country yet
[16:35:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wus1uk4p/8/
[16:35:18] <Dr-007> i dont know why it would happen neither
[16:35:19] <robertmaxrees> *filter, not map.
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> and your search could net multiple countries.
[16:35:57] <robertmaxrees> so this returns the first one it finds.
[16:36:32] <Dr-007> nope it can't its the result a user selects when using autocomplete searching for a placename above google maps
[16:36:38] <Dr-007> so its one placename
[16:36:41] <Dr-007> okay
[16:36:54] <Dr-007> maybe perhabs with kerkrade in holland thats devided by two country's
[16:37:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:37:11] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused by how this data structure works, but oK>
[16:37:16] <Dr-007> thats a town laying in 2 countrys
[16:37:25] <robertmaxrees> right, i gathered.
[16:37:29] <robertmaxrees> you're not paying attention to the data.
[16:38:17] <Dr-007> neat function
[16:38:25] <Dr-007> i dont understand it tho :p
[16:38:30] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[16:39:31] <Dr-007> (im googling .filter now :)
[16:39:47] <robertmaxrees> so .filter() - you give this a function that it'll run on each thing in the array.  if the function returns true for something, it adds it to the new array it's returning.
[16:39:53] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[16:41:02] <Dr-007> and this is way faster then $.each?
[16:41:10] <robertmaxrees> $.each() isn't what you want.
[16:41:25] <robertmaxrees> and don't prematurely optimize ;)
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> plus you were nesting an each in an each - that's going to be nonperformant, but again $.each() isn't what you wanted originally anyway.
[16:42:18] <Dr-007> but then why dont i want it originally. if it isn't faster
[16:42:22] <Dr-007> the code is way smaller
[16:42:26] <Dr-007> that's true
[16:42:36] <Dr-007> but $.each is the only way i know :p
[16:42:39] <robertmaxrees> $.each() means "i want to do something for each item in this array"
[16:42:43] <robertmaxrees> just like the native .forEach()
[16:42:44] <Dr-007> im not really a javascript guru
[16:43:00] <robertmaxrees> .filter() means "i only want everything that matches a particular predicate"
[16:43:02] <robertmaxrees> you want .filter()
[16:43:07] <Dr-007> aha
[16:43:17] <Dr-007> so with $.each
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> also: $.each() doesn't return the way you want it to, so it's totally inappropriate anyway.,
[16:43:29] <Dr-007> "i want to do something for each item in this array"
[16:43:41] <Dr-007> does this mean you can alter something like this in this manor? ;
[16:43:50] <Dr-007> *grabbing an example*
[16:44:48] <Dr-007> $.each(address_components, function(key, subdata) { subdata.short_name = false };
[16:44:50] <Dr-007> instead of
[16:45:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good idea.
[16:45:10] <Dr-007> $.each(address_components, function(key, subdata) { address_components[key].short_name = false };
[16:45:39] <Dr-007> but thats the idea of "i want to do something for each item in this array" ?
[16:45:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:45:49] <robertmaxrees> that's mutating data, which is a bad idea.
[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> don't mutate data.
[16:46:02] <robertmaxrees> why are you changing data like that?
[16:46:08] <Dr-007> i'm not
[16:46:15] <robertmaxrees> ... yes you are.
[16:46:25] <Dr-007> it was just an example derived from the function in pastebin
[16:46:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:46:37] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[16:46:42] <Dr-007> i am not!
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> then it's an irrelevant example?
[16:46:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm way confused.
[16:46:59] <Dr-007> jup, its not being used
[16:47:01] <Dr-007> at all.
[16:47:13] <robertmaxrees> then it's a bad example lol.
[16:47:26] <Dr-007> i was asking about the "i want to do something for each item in this array"
[16:47:28] <robertmaxrees> .forEach() would be better if you wanted to, say, run an ajax call for every item in an array.
[16:48:07] <robertmaxrees> or if you wanted to add a bunch of stuff to your page in a way that's more complex than a .join() would be for.
[16:48:23] <robertmaxrees> normally though, you don't actually want forEach, you want map or filter or some or every.
[16:48:35] <Dr-007> ok
[16:49:00] <Dr-007> which are standard javascript functions, except for forEach?
[16:49:06] <robertmaxrees> forEach() is standard.
[16:49:08] <Dr-007> oh well. thanks for your help
[16:49:15] <Dr-007> i wont take any more of your time! ;)
[16:49:23] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[16:49:23] <Dr-007> i will use the filter function
[16:49:34] <Dr-007> and try to remember it for the next time i need something like that
[16:49:37] <robertmaxrees> check out the other methdos on the left :)
[16:50:00] <Dr-007> hmm
[16:50:09] <Dr-007> that's quite a bunch
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> focus on filter, map, some, every, and foreach.
[16:50:38] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:50:45] <robertmaxrees> those 5 will get you really far.
[16:51:13] <Dr-007> and..!
[16:51:37] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:51:37] <Dr-007> jsonStringify(); for my next object output /question ;)
[16:51:44] <robertmaxrees> no
[16:51:47] <Dr-007> oh
[16:51:48] <robertmaxrees> JSON.stringify();
[16:51:52] <Dr-007> lol
[16:51:53] <Dr-007> ok
[16:54:10] <Dr-007> the comments inside the code on the website are hilarious
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:54:25] <Dr-007> 6. Let k be 0.
[16:54:31] <Dr-007> k = 0;
[16:54:37] <Dr-007> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every
[16:54:43] <robertmaxrees> why is that funny?
[16:55:03] <Dr-007> it isnt really needed
[16:55:09] <Dr-007> i mean..
[16:55:17] <Dr-007> you see that k is being set to 0!
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> sure - but a lot of people wouldn't understand why.
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> excessive, accurate comments are good for things like this.

[20:30:41] <jonez> greetings
[20:31:26] <jonez> I have a jqueryui issue. I'm using tooltip, and I want to make it much wider. I've tried setting up css with something like "body div.ui-tooltip" and setting width to both a percentage and a pixel width with no change. help? :)
[22:27:19] <tuskkk___> I have this search input field, along which I have the search button, now on click I am sending an ajax request to display the result. Now I need to display the search results when a user clicks enter, how do I do it?
[22:29:55] <Uhkis> bind to submit, not click
[22:34:21] <tuskkk___> yep, got it!
[22:35:34] <tuskkk___> One more thing, when someone searches a text, there is a partial view of results, but now when the user removes those charaters, how to get the previous page back?
[22:46:27] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[23:49:44] <hellyeah> morning
[23:50:09] <mdev> good morning
[23:51:05] <ayushgp> var m = function(
[23:51:05] <ayushgp>     var URL = "api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat="+x.coords.latitude+"&lon="+x.coords.longitude;
[23:51:05] <ayushgp>     console.log(URL);
[23:51:05] <ayushgp>     $.get(URL);
[23:51:05] <ayushgp>   };
[23:51:05] <ayushgp>   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(m);
[23:51:24] <ayushgp> this call gives a 404 error
[23:51:43] <Kartagis> ugh
[23:51:44] <mdev> did you try it in your browser first?
[23:51:49] <Kartagis> pastebin dude!
[23:51:50] <ayushgp> while when i use the url in browser it shows that page
[23:51:51] <ayushgp> yes
[23:51:56] <ayushgp> sorry
[23:52:09] <mdev> what is navigator
[23:52:35] <mdev> i guess is part of some .js code you're using?
[23:52:47] <ayushgp> navigator is the broser object used for geolocation api
[23:52:55] <ayushgp> for getting the coordinates
[23:53:06] <mdev> you probabyl could just do raw jquery request with the URL, as i'm sure it supports JSON so use an .ajax with jquery call
[23:53:09] <mdev> then parse out results
[23:53:22] <mdev> supports JSONP rather so remote request
[23:53:26] <hellyeah> hey
[23:53:34] <hellyeah> do you know about jquery modal window
[23:53:39] <ayushgp> but both get and ajax requests return witha 404
[23:53:41] <hellyeah> it is displayed as block?
[23:54:16] <Uhkis> ayushgp: try adding http:// to the url..
[23:54:26] <mdev> lol Uhkis
[23:54:31] <mdev> yeah that could work :x
[23:54:41] <mdev> Uhkis wins at the internet
[23:54:52] <ayushgp> yeah!
[23:55:07] <ayushgp> it works! thanks @Uhkis
[23:55:21] <mdev> lol sometimes the simplest solution is the best
[23:55:30] <ayushgp> true that
[23:55:38] <mdev> i'm so use to seeing CDN urls it didn't occur to me
[23:58:18] <rkrara> Hello People what is the difference between $(document).html(data), $(document.body).html(data), $("body").html(data). I need to know this so as to create jqm pages dynamically
