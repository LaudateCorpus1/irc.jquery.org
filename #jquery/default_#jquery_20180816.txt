[09:07:43] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:08:37] <jomofcw> I was using jQuery UI tooltip plugin to insert nice tooltip on my websites. But, as it's the last thing I use from jQuery UI, i'm trying to find something else. Do you guys use some tooltip plugin, please ? Which one ?
[09:43:15] <thykka> jomofcw, maybe use the html title attribute? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title
