[00:50:09] <WawaSeb> window.close() doesn't work with FF 25.0.1 ?
[00:51:36] <WawaSeb> Tested on several PC's
[00:51:41] <WawaSeb> FF 25.0 -> OK
[00:51:50] <WawaSeb> FF 25.0.1 -> NOP
[00:51:58] <WawaSeb> New sec policy ?
[00:52:02] <sacho_> on what window
[00:52:09] <WawaSeb> Is it a bug or a feature ?
[00:52:14] <WawaSeb> Simple html page
[00:52:47] <sacho_> you shouldn't be able to close pages opened by the user
[00:54:40] <WawaSeb> I agree but it's strange since it works perfectly with FF 25.0
[00:55:09] <sacho_> test case?
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> <html>
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> <head>
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> </head>
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> <body>
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> <script type="text/javascript">
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> window.close();
[00:56:46] <WawaSeb> </script>
[00:56:47] <WawaSeb> Hello World
[00:56:47] <WawaSeb> </body>
[00:56:48] <WawaSeb> </html>
[01:00:48] <sacho_> unsurprisingly, doesn't work on firefox 23.01
[01:01:34] <WawaSeb> 23 ?
[01:03:55] <WawaSeb> Anyway, many thanks for testing
[01:04:37] <sacho_> there's something else happening. You can't window.close() windows opened by the user.
[01:06:09] <WawaSeb> You're right : http://www.yournewdesigner.com/css-experiments/javascript-window-close-firefox.html
[01:06:19] <WawaSeb> We need to add "window.open('','_parent','');"
[01:08:28] <WawaSeb> It doesn't work either
[01:09:30] <WawaSeb> Strange it works with FF 25.0.0
[01:09:41] <WawaSeb> Thank you very much
[01:09:53] <WawaSeb> We don't really need it, we're just playing
[01:09:54] <WawaSeb> :)
[01:18:51] <WawaSeb> So, it was a bug    :p
[01:19:03] <WawaSeb> "only popups or parent owned child's can be closed as of now". ==> https://support.mozilla.org/fr/questions/966137
[01:32:26] <chrislabeard> Hi, i'm trying to do a simple position selector from an image. It works great for the first one in filling the values in the fields. But on the next one it fills it out and the first one... not sure what i'm doing work.. Here is what I have -- http://pastebin.com/GgmavNLD
[01:36:37] <joroci> chrisbuchholz
[01:36:39] <joroci> i mean
[01:37:06] <joroci> chrislabeard using .click() builds up click events
[01:37:31] <joroci> so every click for image-picker add a click event for image-popup img
[01:37:40] <joroci> you are not removing the old event
[01:37:44] <chrislabeard> oh
[01:37:59] <chrislabeard> that makes sense
[01:38:41] <chrislabeard> joroci: would I use unbind() ?
[01:39:25] <joroci> that would work
[01:39:40] <chrislabeard> or is there an easier way to do it?
[01:40:48] <joroci> maybe you can use the "on" method
[01:41:56] <chrislabeard> and that would replace my click
[01:42:23] <joroci> yea
[01:42:58] <joroci> you can use on for the popup img and on for location
[01:43:12] <joroci> or just use one on and check which element was clicked
[01:44:29] <chrislabeard> not sure how to do that
[01:44:43] <chrislabeard> i changed all the clicks out for .on('click'
[01:44:51] <chrislabeard> doing the same thing, do I still need to unbind them
[01:45:01] <joroci> no
[01:45:09] <joroci> can you make a fiddle for this?
[01:45:17] <chrislabeard> yeah I have one its just really messed up
[01:45:26] <joroci> clean it and post
[01:45:43] <chrislabeard> k will do
[01:51:23] <chrislabeard> joroci: http://jsfiddle.net/PSN3A/4/
[01:51:39] <chrislabeard> joroci: the html is a little messy, i'm just grabbing an exert from the site I'm working on
[01:53:30] <Whiskey> FindThis() <-- How can i set timer to this, so it go in in that function whit 1s delay
[01:54:01] <joroci> i can't even find the element
[01:54:20] <chrislabeard> in the html?
[01:54:30] <chrislabeard> i can clean it up more, really sorry its so much crap
[01:55:05] <chrislabeard> the picker is called "Pick Location"
[01:56:17] <joroci> add only the relevant code
[01:57:02] <joroci> whiskey do you mean setInterval?
[02:02:54] <Fishbowne> which is better to use for yur Rest API... JSON or XML ?  Does it matter ?
[02:03:13] <Fishbowne> does it matter with Jquery's ability to Paser either one and convert to a jso
[02:03:27] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/uwWeb/2/ something wrong in that code? my console don´t like it
[02:05:34] <joroci> json is better than xml
[02:05:56] <joroci> Fishbowne what is type head?
[02:06:08] <joroci> and jpg url?
[02:06:28] <joroci> i mean Whiskey:D
[02:08:12] <chrislabeard> joroci: http://jsfiddle.net/PSN3A/7/
[02:09:16] <joroci> so the problem it's the same picture?
[02:09:49] <chrislabeard> joroci: no when you click on the picture and hit save location, then go to the next one and do the same thing it overwrites the first one
[02:09:56] <Whiskey> i just try to see if file exist or not
[02:10:05] <chrislabeard> joroci: oh not to me sorry
[02:11:40] <joroci> can you see the save location?
[02:11:57] <chrislabeard> yeah it shows up at the bottom of the picture
[02:12:22] <joroci> my screen is too small :)
[02:12:22] <joroci> sec
[02:12:48] <chrislabeard> oh I can change it to absolute instead of fixed
[02:12:51] <chrislabeard> that should help
[02:14:38] <joroci> nothing happens when i save
[02:14:59] <chrislabeard> it should just put the values in the fields
[02:15:03] <chrislabeard> at least it is for me
[02:15:59] <chrislabeard> save the values and fade out the image
[02:17:12] <joroci> what are you trying to do?
[02:17:40] <chrislabeard> I want to be able to easily select a location on the image and get the values x/y
[02:18:07] <Whiskey> lol
[02:18:07] <joroci> so you want an image and when you click on it you want the x and y?
[02:18:12] <Whiskey> i did try to delay it it kills my browser :D
[02:18:25] <chrislabeard> right, and then it sets the value of those 2 fields
[02:18:38] <chrislabeard> its doing it currently, but when I try and do the second one it overrides the first.
[02:18:46] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/dLeqQ/
[02:18:56] <joroci> you multiple images?
[02:19:00] <chrislabeard> just 1 image
[02:19:21] <joroci> no i mean each image got 2 fields
[02:19:21] <joroci> ?
[02:19:29] <joroci> like the first example?
[02:19:36] <chrislabeard> its the same image for all of them
[02:19:50] <Whiskey> why does not the setInterval working?
[02:20:29] <joroci> so why do you have 3 pick location?
[02:20:40] <chrislabeard> there should only be 2
[02:20:42] <Whiskey> joroci? talk to me?
[02:20:48] <chrislabeard> joroci: http://jsfiddle.net/PSN3A/7/
[02:20:51] <chrislabeard> thats the one your looking at
[02:21:12] <joroci> i don't what you did whiskey
[02:23:46] <Whiskey> ??
[02:27:27] <joroci> chrisbuchholz
[02:27:30] <joroci> remm
[02:27:35] <joroci> chrislabeard: http://jsfiddle.net/PSN3A/8/
[02:27:58] <chrislabeard> joroci: there we go that works
[02:28:05] <Whiskey> joroci: what about that time out?
[02:28:47] <joroci> Whiskey i can't know why it's not working without looking at the code
[02:28:51] <chrislabeard> joroci: thanks man
[02:28:53] <joroci> np
[02:29:20] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/dLeqQ/1/ its there
[02:30:38] <joroci> Whiskey why are you using ajax?
[02:31:36] <Whiskey> it was the only thing i found
[02:31:58] <Whiskey> i suck at jQuery all need is something that check every second if a file exist or not
[02:32:15] <Whiskey> when file is found, stop checj
[02:32:17] <Whiskey> when file is found, stop check
[02:33:13] <joroci> check every second?
[02:33:20] <Whiskey> yeh
[02:33:28] <joroci> why?
[02:33:35] <Whiskey> when page is loaded, i create the file it check after
[02:33:49] <Whiskey> but that is made in background so it need to know when its there
[02:37:14] <ProMess_> hello!
[02:37:24] <Whiskey> joroci: i think thats quite smart
[02:39:03] <joroci> i think there is a better a way for what you are trying to achieve
[02:39:21] <ProMess_> if i'm using jquery datepicker to select 2 dates, is there a way to default an end date field after having selected a start date?
[02:39:23] <Whiskey> like how?
[02:39:40] <Whiskey> is no way to do that whitout javascript
[02:39:41] <joroci> i don't know what you are doing but checking every second..
[02:39:58] <Whiskey> well it take max 30s for file to be created
[02:40:12] <joroci> ProMess there is a select event for the startdate
[02:40:25] <joroci> in that function set the date based on the startdate
[02:40:51] <ProMess_> joroci, i'm sorry i'm a back end guy and rather noobish when it comes to javascript and jquery specifically
[02:41:04] <Whiskey> joroci: you won´t help me then?
[02:41:06] <ProMess_> currently, there doesn't appear to be a function to set the date in what i'm using.
[02:42:10] <joroci> ProMess when you create the datepicker like
[02:42:14] <ProMess_> yeah
[02:42:17] <joroci> $(element).datepicker({});
[02:42:20] <ProMess_> yeah
[02:42:22] <joroci> you can add
[02:42:26] <ProMess_> i'm seeing that i can populate an alternate field
[02:42:31] <joroci> onSelect: function()
[02:42:39] <ProMess_> (looking at the docs)
[02:42:45] <joroci> in this function set the enddate
[02:42:56] <ProMess_> i just don't know how i would take the end date, and set it to be +2 days more
[02:43:01] <Whiskey> joroci: when file exist, jQuery change the text in the div
[02:43:25] <joroci> you mean startDate
[02:43:56] <ProMess_> yeah, sorry joroci
[02:44:24] <joroci> var currentDate = $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "getDate" );
[02:44:25] <Whiskey> + javascript is the only think that can check stuff after page is loaded, its no other way to do that
[02:44:48] <ProMess_> whisky you should probably be using ajax right?
[02:45:05] <Whiskey> yeh i asked for help, but no one helps me :)
[02:45:06] <joroci> using ajax every second is not the way
[02:45:15] <joroci> if it takes up to 30 seconds
[02:45:16] <Whiskey> then what use insted of it
[02:45:20] <joroci> wait 30 seconds and get the file
[02:45:33] <Whiskey> well thats not an option
[02:45:35] <ProMess_> whoa, every second? that's a ton
[02:45:37] <Whiskey> as it can take from 4 to 30s
[02:45:47] <rtc65> hello
[02:45:48] <joroci> if it can happen to one user....
[02:45:58] <ProMess_> then check every 5, but you're going to be using a massive amount of data unless you minimize the entire thing.
[02:46:03] <rtc65> can I make some  scroll animation with jquery only or I need some plugin?
[02:46:12] <rtc65> so when visitor scrolsl the browser the elements move
[02:46:17] <Whiskey> what about jQjuery url?
[02:46:27] <ProMess_> rtc65, look up parallax tutorials
[02:46:40] <joroci> ProMess
[02:46:50] <rtc65> this is not possible with jquery only?
[02:46:57] <Whiskey> or any other way then ajax that can find out if files exist or not
[02:47:20] <Whiskey> it don´t has to download it or do anything, it just need to see that http://www.some.com/file.ext exist
[02:47:34] <ProMess_> oh yeah, it is, but parallax does that with multiple items. it's probably the effect you're looking for
[02:47:59] <ProMess_> what's up joroci?
[02:48:41] <Whiskey> and find out if url is valid or not can´t take mutch of anything
[02:50:19] <rtc65> so
[02:50:29] <rtc65> what is best way to animate element?
[02:50:35] <rtc65> .animate() ?
[02:50:59] <Whiskey> no one has any sugesstions?
[02:51:43] <rtc65> anyone knows if skroll works in ie9?
[02:52:00] <ProMess_> ie9 is garbage, why develop for it?
[02:53:01] <joroci> ie9 is the minimum for now
[02:57:08] <Fishbowne> XML or JSON /
[02:58:44] <hemangpatel> Can i create custom box for jquery unload event ?
[02:59:05] <hemangpatel> facebook is doing that
[03:01:02] <rtc65> anyone?
[03:05:10] <rtc65> what is best way to animate element?
[03:05:20] <rtc65> .animate()?
[03:05:22] <joroci> css3
[03:05:39] <rtc65> is it using transitions?
[03:05:49] <rtc65> joroci, I am talking cross browser compatible
[03:05:54] <rtc65> fr ie9 too without ransitioins
[03:06:00] <rtc65> so animate() is using transitions right?
[03:06:06] <rtc65> for ie9 what is animate() using?
[03:07:45] <joroci> javascript
[03:11:51] <rtc65> ok
[03:11:52] <rtc65> nice
[03:12:01] <rtc65> so animate is besst thing to use to animate elements i guess
[03:21:54] <JasonFried> someone around?
[03:21:59] <JasonFried> with phonegap experience?
[03:24:46] <ProMess_> can someone tell me why this doesn't work? i'm not seeing anything wrong :( http://jsfiddle.net/6MvM6/1/
[03:27:05] <_rgn> ProMess_: line 7
[03:27:29] <ProMess_> what's wrong there rgn?
[03:27:50] <_rgn> read up on how to define functions
[03:28:08] <_rgn> more specifically the syntax
[03:46:56] <ProMess_> thanks _rgn; can you tell me why the maxDate and minDate aren't working in the date pickers? that seems kind of funky.
[03:47:17] <ProMess_> http://jsfiddle.net/6MvM6/5/
[03:48:35] <ProMess_> herp derp nvm
[04:01:59] <dekiss> an
[04:02:09] <dekiss> anyone have experience using skrollr jquery library?
[04:06:31] <kansai> could you help me to answering this java question pls http://pastebin.com/WvmU9b7Q ??
[04:13:51] <javalover> I have a question about tabs....
[04:14:09] <javalover> I'm currently using them using the default code layout....but can you create tabs without following that layout?
[04:14:29] <javalover> like can I just attach the tab to any div & then use idk say an img to activate it?
[04:15:32] <javalover> imma try it out but idk just odd
[04:28:00] <ph88> javalover: use css
[04:31:04] <kansai> i need to get datas on cloud via android.. instead of using cloudclient , i can use rest api on android but writing with java class  ??
[04:31:11] <kansai> i write on c# but need help to write it in java http://pastebin.com/wEgpWbiu ?
[04:31:49] <joroci> so you ask it here?
[04:32:01] <kansai> where should i ask in
[04:32:13] <joroci> java room ?
[04:34:13] <kansai> java says its android question :(
[04:38:32] <joroci> and android is java not jquery/javacsript :)
[04:39:09] <javalover> ph88
[04:39:13] <javalover> i just gave it a try
[04:39:21] <javalover> it worked when using ul li format
[04:39:26] <javalover> but then using like div format it failed
[04:39:51] <javalover> perhaps style = display:ul or something?
[04:40:04] <joroci> what?
[04:40:47] <javalover> basically the format for tabs
[04:40:54] <javalover> is that you use UL LI
[04:41:05] <javalover> but I want to do the same thing using a div
[04:41:15] <javalover> doesn't work if I do div though for the jquery plugin
[04:41:29] <javalover> so I was wondering if maybe I could tirck it into working
[04:41:29] <joroci> got example?
[04:41:32] <javalover> sure
[04:41:37] <javalover> lemme fiddle
[04:42:08] <javalover> perfect we'll build off this guy
[04:42:08] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/webdevem/p3sfy/
[04:42:21] <javalover> so his works right
[04:42:25] <javalover> now i'll make it using divs
[04:43:20] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/p3sfy/2030/
[04:43:26] <javalover> as you can see from my update, it breaks instantly
[04:43:34] <joroci> 2030?
[04:43:54] <javalover> yeah so the first link it works, and then I just replaced the ul li tags, with div
[04:43:57] <javalover> and it breaks it instantly
[04:44:29] <javalover> the thing is, I have a formatted div setup for this & just want to transfer it
[04:44:56] <javalover> but i'd have to change it to ul/li   which is making me uncomfortable.   But if I could just get it to work using divs i think i could easily transfer it
[04:48:20] <joroci> why uncomfortable/
[04:48:22] <joroci> ?
[04:48:26] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/p3sfy/2031/
[04:48:29] <javalover> maybe i can do it like this
[04:48:30] <hemangpatel> how can i customize unload event ?
[04:48:39] <javalover> joroci it's just hard for me to see how to do it
[04:48:44] <javalover> and takes a long time to setup to test & fail
[04:49:21] <javalover> i take it you just need a ul
[04:49:26] <javalover> for this to work so I think that's how i'll do it
[04:51:40] <hemangpatel> anyone ?
[04:51:42] <javalover> hmm works
[04:51:45] <javalover> but formatting is off
[04:55:44] <hemangpatel> I searched but can't find
[04:56:30] <javalover> fixed
[04:56:37] <javalover> odd i just replaced the div with li
[04:58:12] <javalover> i guess li works similar to div or something
[04:59:35] <Aquaword> hi, can you help me, I have a loop controlled by a setTimeout, and I want to stop this loop on a hover effect
[05:00:12] <Aquaword> I called clearTimeout, even set a variable to true, what checks the loop but it goes forth
[05:01:07] <joroci> maybe it's in a differnet scope
[05:01:20] <Aquaword> hm
[05:01:29] <Aquaword> the boolean you mean?
[05:01:41] <joroci> yea or the cleartimeout
[05:01:59] <Aquaword> i made the timer a global variable
[05:02:23] <joroci> need to see the code
[05:02:28] <Aquaword> oc
[05:03:20] <joroci> co?
[05:03:26] <Aquaword> of course
[05:05:38] <Aquaword> joroci: http://pastebin.com/eZnhHcVG
[05:06:05] <Aquaword> all the looping works, and the hover also, but the loop continue to .. loop
[05:14:34] <Aquaword> ok i guess i overwrite the timer
[05:14:41] <Aquaword> in the loop
[05:21:55] <Aquaword> yeez, working
[05:22:04] <Aquaword> thanks Aquaword :)

[08:48:59] <coRz> Bloomberg
[08:49:01] <coRz> here?
[08:51:11] <Bloomberg> Hi man!!
[09:56:31] <x-finite> http://pastebin.com/kEvpgY0W .. irrespective of whether or not the text field is empty. it always halts the submission and throws the alert
[09:58:08] <x-finite> never mind ... i solved it :) .. maybe just needed some inspiration :)
[10:48:38] <narcos> Hi there. I've just started with jQuery. Is there a online tool to help me understand how to parse some JSON data?
[10:48:51] <narcos> My JSON is of the form:  http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=gSiuEgwv
[10:49:14] <shoky> narcos: that's not really valid JSON
[10:49:58] <narcos> and i've gotten as far as    $.getJSON("data.json", function(data){$.each( data['networks'], function(k,v) { //do something }
[10:50:02] <narcos> shoky: Oh?
[10:50:38] <narcos> How so?
[10:50:47] <shoky> narcos: j
[10:51:02] <shoky> narcos: json keys must have double-quotes ""
[10:51:22] <narcos> ah ok
[10:51:47] <shoky> well more generally, json strings must have double-quotes
[10:51:48] <narcos> Hm, actually the output does have double quotes when I get it from my web service - not sure why it pasted with single
[10:51:54] <shoky> so not just the keys
[10:52:04] <shoky> oh
[10:52:55] <shoky> and also there are newlines inside strings, i dont think that's valid
[10:53:16] <shoky> oh nevermind that
[10:53:55] <shoky> narcos: well, what's the problem?
[10:53:55] <narcos> I think because I outputted it with Python's pprint for easier reading. Here's a more raw version - http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4bWX9LsR
[10:54:14] <shoky> ok that's valid
[10:54:31] <narcos> So I'm basically trying to parse that and extract the network information - say, just the SSID for now.
[10:55:00] <narcos> I'm finding the tutorials I'm reading don't actually explain what they're doing, and it makes it hard to adapt from their sample JSON
[10:55:00] <shoky> your each loop seems ok (except that its not closed properly)
[10:55:44] <narcos> Sorry probably badly pasted. Lemme show you the actual code
[10:56:20] <ShawnRisk> I have a number of issues (will list one at a time unless otherwise told) with the slideshow on this page: http://ecosanity.org and code: http://pastebin.com/HXNRetUp  1.) The description of the slide is not showing above the thumbnails when you move the cursor to hover over image from the sides.
[11:00:07] <narcos> shoky: So - http://pastebin.com/Qbxb9cVZ
[11:00:23] <narcos> When grabbing the k and v values I get numerical indices and [Object object]
[11:00:53] <shoky> narcos: the numerical indices are the indices of the networks array
[11:01:13] <shoky> narcos: and the objects are the objects in that array
[11:01:16] <narcos> What I want to reference is something like   for network in json.networks{  alert( network['ssid']) }
[11:01:19] <shoky> narcos: don't use alert for debugging. use console.log
[11:01:24] <narcos> ahhh
[11:01:31] <narcos> great tip, ta
[11:01:47] <shoky> and if you donno that one, you'll prolly find this helpful:
[11:01:49] <shoky> `ftjq
[11:01:49] <b-ot> shoky: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:03:18] <shoky> narcos: i'd change the arguments to the each callback like:  $.each(data.networks, function(i, network) { console.log( network.ssid ); ... })
[11:05:02] <narcos> shoky: Great! Super useful
[11:08:05] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[11:11:40] <grafi> ShawnRisk you still have the same problem with the slodeshow?
[11:11:46] <grafi> Didnt we talk about that ages ago?
[11:11:47] <grafi> xD
[11:15:29] <ShawnRisk> yes but more issues came up
[11:16:10] <ShawnRisk> grafi: do you want me to pm you?
[11:21:13] <ShawnRisk> grafi: there?
[11:28:26] <ShawnRisk> very quiet here
[11:28:27] <grafi> no im not
[11:28:29] <grafi> ^^
[11:28:53] <ShawnRisk> oh
[11:32:48] <gordian> guys i'm using a crouFredSel to display pages of thumbnails in a grid. when a user clicks the thumbnails i then use fancybox to display the full size image in an overlay. when the lightbox pops up i want users to be able to use keyboard arrows to navigate through the images in the lightbox without triggering the prev/next nav on the carousel itself. anyone have any suggestions how i might do this?
[11:34:10] <gordian> i'm not sure there's a way to do such a thing using the carouFredSel API
[11:40:44] <willisis> gordian you'll need to carouFredSel to ignore keyboard events. I've never set it up but the full config options are here: http://docs.dev7studios.com/jquery-plugins/caroufredsel-advanced
[11:41:24] <gordian> i know but i want to use keyboard nav on the caroufredsel when the lightbox is NOT active
[11:41:44] <gordian> so i'd need to toggle keyboard listening when the lightbox toggles
[11:44:18] <grafi> gordian that shouldnt be hard
[11:45:33] <gordian> i'm actually able to get the caroufredsel to stop listening to keyboard
[11:45:42] <gordian> but having a tough time getting it to resume
[11:54:07] <gordian> figured it out
[11:54:11] <grafi> cool
[11:54:18] <grafi> the documentation confuses me
[11:54:19] <grafi> :o
[12:04:47] <narcos> I'm using this code to create a list of selectable options -   $( "<select/>", { "class": "my-new-list",  html: items.join( "" ) }).appendTo( "body" );    - but I'd like to change the list size. How would I do this?
[12:05:13] <grafi> size?
[12:06:41] <narcos> Height, maybe. But the keyword is size - http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
[12:06:47] <narcos> "Defines the number of visible options in a drop-down list"
[12:07:09] <narcos> i.e. it'd be <select size=5> ?.. </select>
[12:08:14] <doug65536> narcos: are you sure you want to force it? browsers generally do "the right thing"
[12:08:35] <narcos> Maybe I'm using the wrong element then. I want a list of selectable items
[12:09:00] <doug65536> narcos: you don't want a "dropdown" then?
[12:09:42] <narcos> no
[12:09:55] <narcos> But that's what The Oracle suggested I use
[12:09:58] <narcos> ( Google )
[12:10:40] <doug65536> narcos: you want to add the attribute "multiple" to select to make it a listbox
[12:10:48] <narcos> If you make the size > 1 it creates a scrollable type structure
[12:11:00] <narcos> ahhh
[12:11:11] <doug65536> narcos: ah ok, size= does make it a listbox as well
[12:11:29] <doug65536> narcos: but multiple makes it multi-select
[12:11:33] <shoky> narcos:   $( "<select/>", { "class": "my-new-list",  html: items.join( "" ) }).attr("size", 5)
[12:11:47] <narcos> Hm, I don't think I want a 'multiple' though as I only want one item to be selected
[12:12:52] <doug65536> ok, you want a listbox for aesthetic reasons then. usually a dropdown is sufficient for selecting one thing
[12:13:20] <narcos> Yeah for aestehtic
[12:13:24] <narcos> cool thanks shoky
[12:13:42] <narcos> ALthough for greater aesthetic maybe the box should exist already, and then populate it
[12:16:58] <ShawnRisk> I have a number of issues (will list one at a time unless otherwise told) with the slideshow on this page: http://ecosanity.org and code: http://pastebin.com/t3wZ7TYw  2.) When cursor sits over space between thumbnails, it shows image clicked.  Is there a way to keep the same image showing that I just hovered over until either hover over another image or outside of the popup box?
[12:26:53] <narcos> So, if I wanted to do the later (update a pre-existing select box) I'd create the empty select box in my HTML, and then how would populate it?  Something like   $("#networks").val("<option value='xxx'>one</option> <option value='xxxs'>two</option>");    ?
[12:27:24] <narcos> Where   <div id = "networks"> <select size=3> <option value="one">No data yet...</option> </select> </div>
[12:29:29] <narcos> That doesn't seem to work. I can use  $("#networks").html(?.) to change all of the code between the divs, but that doesn't seem right
[12:35:49] <shoky> narcos: using .html is fine
[12:36:30] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[12:40:27] <narcos> shoky: ok
[12:42:53] <shoky> ShawnRisk: cycle to the old slide when hovering off the popup box, not when hovering off the images
[12:44:04] <ShawnRisk> shoky: yes I understand but what do I do when I hover over the thumbnails and go over the space between them?
[12:44:35] <ShawnRisk> I want the image before to be shown until I hover over another image if possible.
[12:44:50] <ShawnRisk> shoky: ^
[12:45:23] <javalover> shoky!!
[12:45:32] <shoky> ShawnRisk: then DONT cycle to the old slide when hovering off the thumbnails
[12:45:40] <javalover> yo shoky, sup fam?
[12:45:48] <shoky> k javalover. sups
[12:45:56] <shoky> fam?
[12:45:59] <shoky> i'm famished
[12:46:01] <javalover> hahaha, you know
[12:46:11] <javalover> do you have a link to like a copy link code?
[12:46:13] <shoky> not sure i know "fam" :P
[12:46:25] <javalover> i'm looking for a layout for like sharing a link
[12:46:27] <shoky> wwwat?
[12:46:43] <shoky> i don't do likes, sry
[12:47:03] <javalover> but i need like the copy to clipboard icon
[12:47:23] <javalover> i wonder if maybe on pastebin they have that
[12:47:49] <shoky> i have no idea what you're talking about
[12:47:50] <ShawnRisk> shoky: oh I get it
[12:48:37] <javalover> they have it on coding sites sometimes
[12:48:40] <ShawnRisk> shoky: how do I make that happen?
[12:48:48] <javalover> where  you click the icon & it copies to clipboard
[12:49:07] <javalover> ohhh
[12:49:09] <javalover> imgur is a great example
[12:49:50] <shoky> javalover oh. you need flash for that
[12:50:48] <grafi> zeroclipboard ftw
[12:51:32] <shoky> ShawnRisk: add a "mouseleave" event handler for the popup box, and move line 32 from your pastebin into that new mouseleave handler..
[12:51:36] <shoky> ShawnRisk: i guess
[12:52:22] <javalover> no i was just asking for a site that has an example layout
[12:52:28] <javalover> here i'll link you
[12:52:32] <javalover> i made a meme on imgur lol
[12:52:42] <javalover> http://imgur.com/m5mE4Ge
[12:52:53] <javalover> you see on the right hand side, how it has all the link share info. I need examples of that
[12:55:52] <ShawnRisk> shoky: that worked
[12:57:11] <ShawnRisk> shoky: how do I make the slideshow not cycle at all?
[12:58:08] <anEffingChamp> ShawnRisk: Why make it a carousel if it is not supposed to cycle?
[12:58:33] <ShawnRisk> anEffingChamp: how else am I suppose to do this?
[12:59:51] <anEffingChamp> ShawnRisk: Sorry, I am not sure what you are trying to do. As far as I know carousels are supposed to cycle. If you want it to be static then you can just lump every thing into one carousel item, or skip the carousel altogether and just use a DIV, or UL.
[13:00:44] <shoky> ShawnRisk: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html
[13:00:51] <anEffingChamp> ShawnRisk: Also check out http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[13:01:25] <shoky> (i linked there cause i thought you wanted to just pause the cycle)
[13:05:45] <ShawnRisk> anEffingChamp: right but I might want to have the cycle come on at sometime in the future.  There is no way to stop this for now.
[13:07:15] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I see stop but where do I put this?
[13:07:21] <ShawnRisk> anEffingChamp: thanks for the link.
[13:09:19] <shoky> ShawnRisk: whereever you want it to stop..  cycle.cycle('stop');
[13:19:55] <ShawnRisk> shoky: if I use stop, the thumbnails will not advance to next thumbnail when hovering.  This also still cycles.
[13:23:00] <shoky> ShawnRisk: then don't use stop?
[13:26:20] <ShawnRisk> shoky: what to use?  I mean, this still cycles doesn't matter what I use.
[13:27:26] <shoky> ShawnRisk: it still cycles when you use stop?
[13:39:14] <ekkis> I'm using the $.validate() plugin which allows me to add attributes to my form, like "required" - the trouble is this is not valid HTML5 syntax.  how is this handled?
[13:44:35] <ShawnRisk> shoky: yes
[13:51:14] <ShawnRisk> shoky: any thoughts?
[13:54:55] <grafi> anyone know a website that primarily uses orange oô
[13:55:14] <obert> fruits.com

[13:56:04] <archemike> test
[13:56:22] <archemike> help
[13:56:28] <zingiri> how can one join the php channel?
[13:56:37] <archemike> '/q php'
[13:57:57] <JonathanUT> zingiri > /join ##php
[13:58:20] <zingiri> i tried but its invite only?
[13:58:50] <JonathanUT> Nope, itś for registered users only.
[13:59:13] <JonathanUT> And it looks like you haven´t registered yet, Ill jump in your query. :)
[13:59:28] <shoky> ShawnRisk: it stops for me when doing .cycle('stop')  but anyway... you want to pause and resume i guess, not stop
[13:59:48] <ShawnRisk> shoky: really? Why?
[14:00:01] <zingiri> ok and how to rgister
[14:00:14] <JonathanUT> Check your private chat window with me zingiri. :)
[14:00:37] <shoky> ShawnRisk: because that does what you want
[14:01:15] <shoky> you dont want to stop completely, you still want to be able to cycle and resume sometime
[14:02:27] <ShawnRisk> shoky: do I put cycle.cycle('pause'); after the var cycle and cycle.cycle('resume'); in $('.slidenav img').hover(  ?
[14:03:03] <shoky> ShawnRisk: you put .cycle('pause') wherever you want it to pause the cycling.  and then .cycle('resume') wherver you want it to resume
[14:03:24] <ShawnRisk> shoky: yes but I am unsure where that is.  If I knew I wouldn't ask
[14:03:42] <shoky> it's your app. you decide. when do you want it to pause?
[14:04:06] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I want to pause this everything expect when I hover all images.
[14:04:17] <shoky> wat?
[14:04:28] <shoky> brb
[14:04:56] <ShawnRisk> shoky: I want to pause the cycle all the time except for when I hover over thumbnail images.
[14:07:24] <ShawnRisk> I might have fixed this
[14:10:54] <ShawnRisk> shoky: There used to be a white / disappearance of slideshow which might be gone but why would this happen?
[14:21:51] <IceD^> maybe little bit offtopic, but I need some dragndrop jq plugin suggested. I really don't want to touch jqui again (personal) and only thing I need is to be able to move items from one list to another and sort them
[14:28:45] <grafi> with drag and drop?
[14:29:49] <IceD^> yeah
[14:31:26] <IceD^> more specific: using bootstrap3, have two lists with labels in it, want to be able to drag them labels around
[14:31:45] <shoky> ShawnRisk: i donno, would need to see it in action
[14:33:58] <IceD^> want it to look like all proper dnds look  - leaving some dotted placeholders, you know. 'd like to have some hook to "drop completed", don't want to write more than few lines of code for it
[14:40:18] <gary_b> anyone any idea why sortable intermittently detects the wrong destination index when scrolling is involved? http://script.apphb.com/
[14:42:08] <gary_b> its like once the scrolling starts, (as caused by scroll:true being passed to scrollable), it stops detecting which index the dragged item is over
[14:44:24] <gary_b> so if you drag box 1 down to the bottom of the visible area of the larger section, let it scroll down for you, youll notice a lot of the time it drops box 1 2nd from last when you had it hovering after the last item
[14:51:22] <ShawnRisk> shoky: thanks for all the help
[15:01:00] <Hilton> I have a page which displays all the data for a particular item. There are dozens of line items. Rather than create a separate edit page, I've set it up with an "Enable Editing" button, which places an edit button beside each value to allow a person to edit one item at a time. The button hides the value and displays an input element with save/cancel buttons. This all works very well... EXCEPT...
[15:02:05] <Hilton> The code: http://jsbin.com/afiLajOB/1/edit?html,js,output currently iterates over each element and submits it individually. Most of the values are single input, but some are multiple (such as an address, 4 inputs). This is fine for most of them, but there are certain items I need to submit in a single request.
[15:02:37] <Hilton> How can I accomplish this?
[15:03:05] <Hilton> It doesn't matter if the other sections submit all-together or not.
[15:07:53] <Zak> still reading
[15:08:36] <Zak> right. I understand the problem now
[15:09:36] <Zak> Hilton: i'm no expert in forms but maybe fieldset tag is what you're after
[15:09:42] <Zak> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_fieldset.asp
[15:10:48] <Zak> you'll just need to change your code so it will handle fieldsets correctly
[15:21:42] <Hilton> Will look into it. I think I know how to do it otherwise, just not completely sure how to code it. Will do some trial and error later, I guess.
[15:21:47] <Hilton> Got to go. Thanks.
[15:24:04] <kamuela> I'm trying to write a URL parser to pick up URL parameters and autofill a form (like from a bookmarklet). I can't seem to get it to function. Would someone be able to take a look to see where I could be going awry?
[15:30:14] <IceD^> kamuela: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html
[15:35:53] <kamuela> IceD^: here's what I'm trying now http://pastebin.com/xv8HdKnM
[15:43:55] <shoky> kamuela: you need to set the inputs values inside the onpopstate, not outside
[15:44:12] <IceD^> kamuela: grab that lib
[15:44:26] <IceD^> it's probably only one which actually does work
[15:44:35] <Eagle5> hey can anyone help me? i have a lot of objects in one array
[15:44:43] <Eagle5> in php
[15:44:51] <Eagle5> and im trying to send each object gradually
[15:44:55] <Eagle5> and display it on the site
[15:45:02] * IceD^ checked channel name
[15:45:44] <Eagle5> on a page i have a loop json_encoding each object
[15:45:51] <Eagle5> every 100 ms
[15:46:07] <Eagle5> and im trying to use ajax to read the object and use jquery to do things
[15:46:09] <Eagle5> but its not working
[15:46:09] <sunbeam> when I do .height() i do not get the padding top and bottom
[15:46:13] <sunbeam> how can I get this aswell?
[15:46:40] <kamuela> shoky: oh... holy cow. that makes sense
[15:47:03] <kamuela> IceD^: I think I probably should use that library if it is as simple as parsing through standard URL args
[15:49:05] <shoky> sunbeam there's .outerHeight() which includes padding/border
[15:50:14] <sunbeam> thanks shoky
[15:50:23] <shoky> sunbeam: oh and innerHeight just includes padding
[15:50:41] <sunbeam> shoky: $(window).on('resize' is it possible to add on window load aswell to this?
[15:50:59] <shoky> what?
[15:51:19] <sunbeam> $(window).on('resize', 'load', function()
[15:51:23] <sunbeam> is something like that possible?
[15:52:08] <shoky> .on('resize load', function() {
[15:52:12] <shoky> should work i think
[15:52:18] <sunbeam> ok thanks
[15:54:17] <kamuela> I'm having a hell of a time testing this code. It's a meteor project, and I love meteor, but I'm not able to run it locally for some reason and don't want to deal with it live on the client's server. Basically I'm trying to setup a dummy page and controller to check this URL parser against
[15:54:56] <shoky> kamuela:  http://jsbin.com/ABAbimoB/2/edit
[15:55:44] <shoky> (just thought that might help with testing..)
[15:57:27] <kamuela> omg shoky... y u so lovable??
[15:57:55] <shoky> ;]
[16:02:33] <il> how can I make sure divs in different jquery tabs do not overlap? http://soundcry.com/tester
[16:08:10] <kamuela> shoky: that history.pushstate was just proof of concept for jsbin, right? the actual parsing happens within the function block
[16:09:09] <shoky> kamuela: yeap
[16:22:26] <kamuela> shoky: you don't happen to have particular experience with meteorjs do you?
[16:23:09] <shoky> kamuela: nopes
[16:23:42] <kamuela> shoky: darn. there's a weird directive in its templating system called "constant," and i is scurred thinking it is a jquery-eater
[16:24:03] <shoky> whatcha mean?
[16:24:27] <kamuela> well, here's the doc on it http://docs.meteor.com/#constant
[16:25:29] <kamuela> actually, reading that, i think it's designed to do the exact opposite which is leave the enclosing code to its own devices
[16:26:28] <shoky> kamuela: is there a reason why you're not using meteor API's and rely on it to update the DOM for you ?
[16:27:37] <shoky> i donno meteor at all but i think it does data-binding to the DOM, and that updating the DOM on your own with jquery "behind meteors back" is not the intended usage
[16:28:59] <kamuela> shoky: this is the bookmarklet code i am using: javascript:location.href='http://localhost:3000/submit?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)
[16:29:04] <shoky> at least, not if you can help it
[16:29:08] <kamuela> shoky: just to rule it out, i haven't botched that as well right?
[16:30:41] <shoky> think thats ok..
[16:33:19] <kamuela> shoky: meteor (with this implementation) has both a controller and a standalone router. you may be right with the event handling thing, and it is possible what i should be doing is running this code in a load event with meteor. that being said, in your experience, does this make more sense being part of the controller or part of the router?
[16:34:39] <shoky> parsing the url? router.  updating the DOM? controller (via automatic bindings to your data, hopefully)
[16:35:13] <shoky> but im not so good with the terminology
[16:35:23] <shoky> so i may be totally off
[16:36:20] <kamuela> agggghhhh! i wish this server would just work on my local computer!
[16:40:49] <grafi> dont we all

[17:05:58] <radicalbiscuit> Why isn't my animation function animating? It should shake the input when the button is pressed. Works when I issue animation commands from console. http://jsfiddle.net/X8nqL/
[17:47:40] <kansai> hi folks, using sub-domains affecting seo performans bad or doesn't matter as long a my content is fine?
[17:49:04] <shoky> radicalbiscuit: http://jsfiddle.net/X8nqL/1/   included jquery-ui also for the background-color animation
[17:50:24] <Wayneman_> can anyone point me to best practices for securing a jQuery ajax login panel?
[17:53:40] <radicalbiscuit> shoky: So it was my bad property name that killed it. Thanks!
[17:55:15] <shoky> radicalbiscuit: no
[17:55:49] <shoky> radicalbiscuit: it was that you didn't put the last .css('position'..  change inside the animate callback
[17:56:04] <shoky> so it happened immediately, reverting back from position:relative
[17:56:21] <shoky> also the bad property name, and also not including jquery-ui (or jquery.color plugin)
[17:56:32] <shoky> er not jquery.color mmm whatever that plugin is
[17:56:59] <radicalbiscuit> Ah, that makes more sense.

[21:39:22] <gx> hi, i have a datatable that's being refreshed every few seconds via ajax. I'm looking for an easy way to highlight any td element that changes on each refresh. anyone done this before?
[21:39:58] <gx> seems like .change() only works on form elements, not table elements
[22:21:01] <Fogest> I am trying to click a button on Facebook using jquery. I tried the .click() function however that does not seem to be working. The element I am trying to click is an <a> element with a role="button" in it.
[22:24:39] <Fogest> Interesting. Just had to add a [0] to it.
[23:55:46] <raj> if .papi has only one child .nino, is $('.papi').find('.nino') slower than $('.papi').children() or even $('.papi').children('.nino') ?
