[00:02:47] <datanity> for this, would lines 2 and 3 be included in the for loop?  or just line 2?
[00:02:48] <datanity> http://pastebin.com/s1g4sLTW
[00:03:06] <Uhkis> Cork: 2 weird things happened with this gnome update btw, 1) i have to "xset m default" on every fresh login 2) $DISPLAY changed from :0 to :1 for no reason
[00:03:27] <Uhkis> datanity: 2 only
[00:04:10] <Cork> datanity: ugg... never use for/if/while without a block
[00:04:24] <Cork> it makes it a pain to read
[00:04:49] <Cork> and yes, if indentation is wrong it becomes a common pitfall for bugs
[00:05:27] <Uhkis> i sometimes use those for onelines
[00:05:35] <datanity> yes, I dont.  It's part of a md5 checker im trying to get working :)
[00:05:55] <Cork> Uhkis: and if() {} is so much longer?
[00:06:34] <Uhkis> Cork: it's 7 keypresses more!! :D
[00:06:37] <Cork> (yes i'm very strongly opposed for block less statements)
[00:07:01] <Cork> blockless even
[00:07:49] <Uhkis> hmm, i actually added those {} because jshint didn't agree with blockless
[00:08:03] <Cork> Uhkis: for the same reason :)
[00:08:14] <Cork> jshint doesn't require it for the fun of it :)
[00:08:29] <Cork> if statements without {} is a common source of bugs
[00:10:01] <Uhkis> which is why i strictly used them for oneliners only
[00:10:12] <Cork> huh?
[00:10:34] <Cork> you can't do multiple lines without a block
[00:10:44] <Cork> so that statement doesn't make sense
[00:10:49] <Uhkis> onelines as in: if (blah) return;
[00:11:04] <Cork> if (blah) { return; }
[00:12:01] <Uhkis> yes, that's what i was forced to do! :D
[00:12:17] <Cork> ...
[00:12:51] <Cork> Uhkis: you shouldn't be forced to do it, you should do it by instinct
[00:12:57] <Cork> cause the other one is risky
[00:13:14] <Cork> if(foo) bar; baz;
[00:13:17] <Cork> hmm...
[00:15:20] <Uhkis> foo ? bar : baz;
[00:15:31] <Cork> that isn't the same
[00:15:48] <Cork> if(foo) bar; baz; is the same as if(foo) { bar; } baz;
[00:16:06] <Cork> and is me trying to explain why not having blocks there is a bad idea
[00:16:23] <Cork> especially in the light of js minification
[00:16:48] <Uhkis> good catch
[00:19:38] <Kartagis> something's irritating me. I don't see any of my javascript working. http://paste.debian.net/167031/ why would this not work?
[00:19:49] <Kartagis> on my device that is
[00:20:35] <Uhkis> i can't see a single jquery line in that paste
[00:20:49] <Cork> Kartagis: we can't debug js in our head
[00:21:02] <Cork> "not working" is no information to go on either
[00:21:25] <Kartagis> Cork: even the alert() is not working
[00:21:27] <Uhkis> mobile device debugging is even harder in our heads :D
[00:21:30] <Cork> so either make a running demo (jsfiddle) or at least give the error/assertion/what ever you get
[00:21:36] <Cork> Kartagis: that isn't enough
[00:22:01] <Cork> Kartagis: you have lots of functions calling back and forth
[00:22:07] <Cork> and some of them are part of objects
[00:22:18] <Cork> but lose there connection with said object
[00:22:31] <Cork> so it is too much going on to say what exactly happens
[00:22:42] <Cork> Kartagis: just test each step separately and see how far you get
[00:44:51] <datanity> if im doing something like this... uArea.each(function () {
[00:45:05] <datanity> then, inside this function i can just use uArea instead of $(this)
[00:45:16] <Cork> no
[00:45:17] <Uhkis> no
[00:45:24] <Cork> cause this inside will be one single element
[00:45:39] <Cork> and that is normally why you use .each in the first place :)
[00:46:05] <tushardhingra17> hi
[00:46:22] <tushardhingra17> i have one problem could any one help to solve it ?
[00:46:31] <Cork> ?ask @ tushardhingra17
[00:46:41] <Cork> aaand the bot is dead...
[00:46:50] <Cork> tushardhingra17: don't ask to ask
[00:46:54] <Cork> just ask
[00:47:32] <Uhkis> RIP b-ot
[00:49:37] <tushardhingra17> @cork
[00:49:40] <tushardhingra17> thanks
[00:50:38] <Uhkis> maybe that was his problem, he didn't know if to ask to ask :-D
[00:51:14] <Xatenev> its retarded to open the terms of service in a popup, or?
[00:51:53] <Cork> Xatenev: too little context
[00:51:54] <thealphanerd> Xatenev: no need to say retarded
[00:52:01] <Uhkis> Xatenev: some people might take offense to the word retard
[00:52:05] <Xatenev> lolz
[00:52:24] <Xatenev> wouldnt understand those people then. w/e - I am having a website with terms of services
[00:52:33] <Cork> Xatenev: cause if you man terms of service for visiting a page, then yes i would say it is
[00:52:36] <Xatenev> and in a ticket it says I should implement the terms of services as a popup
[00:52:45] <Xatenev> its a big page with a lot of text inside it
[00:52:58] <Cork> if it is for example when you buy something and need to agree, and clicking the link leads there; then no it would be a good idea i think
[00:53:06] <Uhkis> Xatenev: doesn't really matter how you display it, no one is never gonna read it anyways :D
[00:53:10] <Xatenev> Uhkis: ikr :P
[00:53:20] <Xatenev> Cork: really?
[00:53:24] <Xatenev> why not just open it in a new tab?
[00:53:35] <Uhkis> that's even easier to dismiss
[00:53:45] <Cork> Xatenev: that is an option too, but ya, most ppl don't read it anyway...
[00:54:05] <Cork> Xatenev: and a new tab is a popup too
[00:54:16] <Xatenev> is it?
[00:54:21] <Cork> window.open <-- historically refered to "popup"
[00:54:25] <Xatenev> yep
[00:54:32] <Cork> *to as
[00:54:51] <Xatenev> so target="_blank" triggers window.open?
[00:54:57] <Cork> no
[00:55:03] <Xatenev> or what are u saying
[00:55:22] <Cork> Xatenev: i'm just saying popup is a big ambiguous
[00:55:27] <Cork> *bit
[00:55:39] <Xatenev> ah k
[00:55:50] <Xatenev> I think they should be able to open it even with JS off though
[00:55:52] <Cork> Xatenev: and if you you window.open widht height and width
[00:56:10] <Cork> you get a full popup, unless the user has configured there browser to always open those as tabs
[00:56:17] <Cork> Xatenev: i agree
[00:56:27] <Cork> Xatenev: you could use a link and override it with js?
[00:56:36] <Cork> that way you support all of the above
[00:56:39] <Xatenev> that would be a good solution i guess
[00:56:54] <Xatenev> yea i will do that, good idea
[00:56:56] <Xatenev> tank u :)
[00:57:00] <Cork> and ya target="_blank" is prob a good idea for the link
[01:47:43] <sgronblo> Is it possible to get a reference to the jquery function from a jquery object?
[01:48:13] <Cork> sgronblo: "jquery function"?
[01:48:36] <sgronblo> the dollar sign function
[01:49:13] <Cork> sgronblo: could you elaborate on what you're trying to do
[01:53:05] <hrusti> maybe (function($){}(JQuery)); is what you  want
[01:54:19] <sgronblo> I think I was able to work around it
[02:12:17] <kschlesselmann> Hi! I use "if ($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() == $(document).height()) {" to detect if the user has scrolled to the bottom but it seems that it only detects if the user scrolls to the top. What am I getting wrong?
[02:20:43] <Cork> kschlesselmann: use window.scrollMaxY
[02:20:53] <Cork> ?mdn scrollMaxY
[02:21:04] <Cork> gah right it's dead
[02:22:49] <appleboy> can I ask something?
[02:22:56] <arthurvr> ?ask @ appleboy
[02:23:04] <arthurvr> b-ot?
[02:23:41] <Cork> kschlesselmann: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollMaxY
[02:23:59] <Cork> arthurvr: dies ~12h ago
[02:24:06] <Cork> *died
[02:24:23] <Cork> appleboy: just ask, no need to ask about asking
[02:24:34] <appleboy> okay
[02:26:17] <kschlesselmann> Cork: like "if ($(window).scrollTop() + window.scrollMaxY == $(document).height()) {" ?
[02:26:27] <Cork> no
[02:26:39] <Cork> $(window).scrollTop() == window.scrollMaxY
[02:26:55] <arthurvr> appleboy: could you please not PM me? I don’t do support in non-public and it’s againt the channel policy.
[02:27:02] <appleboy> yes sir
[02:27:10] <Cork> kschlesselmann: scrollMaxY is the highest value scrollTop can be
[02:27:18] <arthurvr> ~against
[02:27:25] <kschlesselmann> Ahhh … yeah that works. Awesome :-)
[02:27:25] <appleboy> okay okay
[02:27:36] <Cork> arthurvr: /mode <nick> +g ftw
[02:27:52] <Uhkis> what's that mode
[02:28:08] <Cork> Uhkis: /msg Cork hello
[02:28:19] <Cork> and check your status window
[02:28:56] <Uhkis> wow
[02:29:26] <arthurvr> haha yeah
[02:29:37] <Uhkis> that's a bit too harsh for me
[02:29:57] <Cork> it makes wonder when irc gets infested by spam bots
[02:30:02] <Cork> that happens ever other week
[02:32:56] <appleboy> arthurvr: Cork: is on(['click', 'mouseover'], fn) the right way to attach to multiple events?
[02:33:03] <Cork> no
[02:33:06] <arthurvr> http://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/#many-events-but-only-one-event-handler
[02:33:07] <Cork> just add them in one string
[02:33:15] <arthurvr> please refer to that article. It should be a string.
[02:33:16] <Cork> 'click mouseover'
[02:34:03] <arthurvr> if you really need it to be an array just use Array.prototype.join
[02:34:16] <appleboy> oh okay arthurvr
[02:34:59] <appleboy> thankx arthur and cork
[02:35:15] <appleboy> will read that site
[02:35:25] <appleboy> is that an official learning tutorial center?
[02:35:35] <Cork> yes
[02:35:47] <appleboy> okay thanks
[02:36:00] <appleboy> there's just too many bad content on the internetz so want to be sure
[02:36:23] <kschlesselmann> Cork: Can I use that somehow to fill the viewport to? I tried "while(window.scrollMaxY <= 0) { loadData }" but this seems to be an infinite loop :-)
[02:36:28] <Cork> ya, os is one of the worst
[02:36:31] <Uhkis> *.jquery.com is pretty safe bet (learn.jquery.com is also on the topic)
[02:36:36] <Cork> uh.. *so :D
[02:37:08] <Cork> kschlesselmann: you can, but not in a while loop
[02:37:28] <Cork> kschlesselmann: cause that would keep the js running and blocking the browser from repainting
[02:37:41] <kschlesselmann> Oh, ok. What's the way to go?
[02:37:46] <Cork> kschlesselmann: and if the browser doesn't repaint, the scrollMaxY isn't updated
[02:37:53] <Cork> kschlesselmann: use setTimeout
[02:37:57] <Cork> anyway gtg
[02:38:00] <appleboy> okay thanks everybody
[02:38:03] <appleboy> awesome channel
[02:38:12] <arthurvr> you’re welcome appleboy
[02:38:18] <appleboy> ha thanks arthurvr
[02:38:25] <appleboy> bey
[02:38:30] <appleboy> bye
[02:39:11] <Arcarc> Can someone enlighten me why I can't "return [false]" within an .each loop? (or whatever this is)
[02:39:13] <Arcarc> http://hastebin.com/uyolozijoh.js
[02:39:21] <Arcarc> I've solved it, but still curious
[02:40:38] <arthurvr> Arcarc: because you return ‘in another function’ in the first and the second example.
[02:40:50] <arthurvr> Arcarc: in the first one you return from the callback.
[02:40:51] <Arcarc> Ahhh.
[02:40:52] <Arcarc> I see
[02:41:04] <arthurvr> Arcarc: the second one from the outer function.
[02:41:05] <Arcarc> Not used to having functions in functions in other languages
[02:41:36] <arthurvr> get used to it, it’s wonderful :)
[02:41:42] <Uhkis> funception? :-)
[02:41:51] <Arcarc> Cool stuff :)
[02:42:27] <arthurvr> as long as you don’t go into some kind of ‘callback hell’ it’s wonderful
[02:42:37] <arthurvr> meaning as in like 10 levels of nesting lol
[02:43:10] <kschlesselmann> Cork: Sorry … I don't get ho I would use setTimeout to fill my viewport with table rows. Maybe you could explain that when you're back? :-)
[02:45:17] <es6noob> how do I check if something is a weak map?
[02:45:20] <es6noob> in ES6
[02:45:39] <arthurvr> Object.prototype.toString.call(o) === '[object WeakMap]' should do the trick.
[02:45:47] <arthurvr> where `o` is the object.
[02:46:26] <es6noob> works thanks
[02:47:20] <es6noob> === '[object Set]'
[02:47:24] <es6noob> does that work as well
[02:47:29] <arthurvr> it should, yup.
[02:47:40] <es6noob> arthurvr: you rock thanks
[02:48:22] <es6noob> are there other people here toying with ecmascript 6?
[02:50:34] <toomus_> HI. Can someone help me with slideDown and slideUp functions setup?
[02:50:40] <arthurvr> toomus_: yup
[02:50:52] <arthurvr> toomus_: can you make a fiddle explaining your problem?
[02:51:12] <toomus_> OK, this will take a while :)
[02:52:26] <arthurvr> toomus_: we just need a reduced testcase clearly explaining your problem
[02:52:35] <arthurvr> so we can use that as a base to help you fix it lol
[02:54:15] <nikhil_> hi guys. I have the following inline script: https://dpaste.de/OPSk | my html is here: https://dpaste.de/PG3f | why doesn't the jquery get rebound to itemDelete when the new html is loaded from the server?
[02:55:43] <nikhil_> that is, i can click itemDelete to remove a dom element, but on the second attempt to remove a row, the event doesn't even fire
[02:55:55] <nikhil_> so i'm assuming that means the jquery is not rebound
[02:56:29] <arthurvr> nikhil_: you should use a delegated event
[02:56:33] <arthurvr> I think
[02:57:27] <arthurvr> You bind a handler to .card-table and then replace that .card-table
[02:58:20] <arthurvr> If I get your use case right at least
[02:58:41] <nikhil_> arthurvr, I thought that was what $.on() was for. but i figured it out. I changed replaceWith to .html() and all is right in the world
[02:58:58] <nikhil_> thanks for your consideration
[02:59:14] <arthurvr> There is no $.on() lol
[02:59:22] <arthurvr> $.fn.on lol
[02:59:36] <arthurvr> but yup, makes sense.
[03:00:13] <nikhil_> arthurvr, I'm a newbie dev who has just finally basically grokked my backend framework. jquery/js is a whole nother ball game
[03:00:14] <arthurvr> on() delegates events, but please review the api docs carefully, you’ll see that it delegates to the first element you pass (which you replaced)
[03:00:28] <nikhil_> arthurvr, yeah that was the problem
[03:00:32] <arthurvr> yup
[03:00:36] <nikhil_> .html() replaces the inner html and keeps the outer
[03:01:25] <arthurvr> nikhil_: yup
[03:11:50] <gemclip> why would you use $("p").on("click", function() vs $("p").click(function() ir vise versa?
[03:12:16] <gemclip> or is it just prefernce?
[03:12:29] <arthurvr> mostly preference. click() is just a shorthand.
[03:12:43] <arthurvr> could argue about performance but it’s micro
[03:13:01] <gemclip> can you shorthand all the event handlers in this way?
[03:13:08] <arthurvr> no, not all of them.
[03:13:33] <gemclip> so for consistancy on is the better way?
[03:14:04] <arthurvr> well if you use shorthands consistent you can do that lol. on() has some features shorthands don’t have, though.
[03:14:22] <arthurvr> if you’re really interested: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/10399ddcf8a239acc27bdec9231b996b178224d3/src/event/alias.js#L6-17
[03:14:33] <arthurvr> is the piece of source code responsible for these shorthands.
[03:14:47] <arthurvr> shorthands can trigger events as well.
[03:16:16] <gemclip> ahh i see. thank you
[03:16:25] <arthurvr> gemclip: you’re welcome
[03:17:11] <toomus_> This is my problem reproduction https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/
[03:17:25] <pi-> Has anyone consider the idea of extending jquery to also pass mouse coordinates into mouse related events?  Is currently quite a faffle to get the x,y in the coordinate system of the object being clicked on
[03:17:57] <pi-> Especially if that object has some CSS styling applied such as border, padding, scale, maybe even transform!
[03:18:05] <arthurvr> toomus_: and what exactly would you like to do with that?
[03:18:29] <pi-> ^ considerED (speech recognition glitch)
[03:20:04] <toomus_> <arthurvr> When you click on #top-bar, box should slide down
[03:20:27] <toomus_> <arthurvr> Like in facebook chat
[03:20:54] <arthurvr> oh that way
[03:20:59] <toomus_> This is probably bad css :/
[03:23:50] <Omar-> hi everyone
[03:23:55] <arthurvr> hey
[03:24:18] <Omar-> hi arthurvr how are you?
[03:24:33] <es6noob> arthurvr: you've got another few minutes?
[03:24:36] <arthurvr> I do
[03:24:43] <arthurvr> Omar-: fine thank you :)
[03:25:33] <es6noob> this time I've got a jQuery Mobile question is that okay?
[03:25:46] <arthurvr> why wouldn’t it be
[03:26:15] <es6noob> do  you know jQuery Mobile?
[03:26:18] <arthurvr> ?aks
[03:26:20] <arthurvr> ?ask
[03:26:24] <arthurvr> arrgg bot is away
[03:26:29] <arthurvr> just ask, es6noob
[03:27:30] <toomus_> <arthurvr> Do you know why my above code doesn't work?
[03:27:55] <arthurvr> I know why it doesn’t work but I have no real idea nor time to fix it now :(
[03:28:24] <toomus_> <arthurvr> ahh, ok, amybe someone else have time?
[03:28:36] <arthurvr> toomus_: there are 700 other people in the channel :)
[03:29:17] <toomus_> <arthurvr> Do you know who may help?
[03:30:20] <arthurvr> toomus_: just stick around for a while and you’ll see lol
[03:30:34] <toomus_> <arthurvr> clever :P
[03:31:35] <Uhkis> at first i thought those were fake "funny" pastes
[03:31:44] <Uhkis> toomus_: <> arent a part of the nick
[03:32:35] <toomus_> Uhkis: I got it :)
[03:35:20] <Tennis> Hey I'm using datatables pagination . does anyone know of a plugin or method/setting to highlight the selected page?
[03:35:30] <Tennis> I can write something in js but don't want to reinvent the wheel
[03:41:25] <toomus_> Does anyone have time to check my js fiddle? https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/
[03:42:42] <decx> ids have to be unique
[03:45:40] <toomus_> decx: this is only example
[03:47:12] <decx> so?
[03:47:58] <toomus_> it doesn't change exactly in this example
[03:48:13] <decx> it only works by accident
[03:48:41] <decx> div# sidesteps the first pitfall and find('#') the second
[03:49:46] <toomus_> in my production code I have additional attribute in .inner-box, which is unique id
[03:50:36] <iTommix> Hi @all… got this problem: i have a div which is „display: none;“ - how can i access elements on this div w/o make it visible?
[03:54:17] <Nothing4You> hi, is $.each() part of a plugin or is it a core feature?
[03:56:07] <toomus_> decx: why you think, this should't work. Each #top-bar is unique to each .inner-box. There is no situation, where two #top-bar are is the same parent element
[03:56:59] <decx> doesnt matter
[03:57:27] <decx> iTommix: what do you want to do with the stuff in your hidden div?
[03:57:37] <decx> Nothing4You: it's core
[03:59:26] <toomus_> decx: https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/1/
[03:59:56] <iTommix> decx: i have formelements on this (input for example) and a image beside this element. now i want to change something on this image… the source for example. all of this is done by loading the page (jQuery(document).ready)
[03:59:57] <Nothing4You> decx: any idea why $ is defined in my browser console but $.each isn't?
[04:00:37] <gemclip> toomus_ whats it not doing?
[04:00:59] <decx> each is used generously all throughout jquery
[04:01:24] <decx> changing source on a childelement shouldnt make problems iTommix
[04:01:43] <toomus_> gemclip: when you click #top-bar, box should slide down like facebook chat
[04:02:16] <iTommix> to clarify: my hidden divs are tabs. on the visible one everything works as expected
[04:02:37] <gemclip> it does for me on chrome
[04:02:50] <decx> it's now double invalid
[04:02:51] <iTommix> but the images on the hidden divs are not modified :(
[04:03:30] <gemclip> toomus_ it slides down for me
[04:03:45] <toomus_> gemclip: Try to hide two boxes, and then click last. This is behavior I want to achieve.
[04:03:49] <decx> ids still have to be unique and custom attributes ar3e invalid
[04:04:15] <gemclip> for all 3 at once when oly one is clicked?
[04:06:36] <toomus_> gemclip: hide two of them, and when you click third, its works good.
[04:07:37] <toomus_> gemclip: It should slide down, and only #top-bar should be visible in bottom of site. Just like facebook chat.
[04:08:07] <Tennis> listen to decx , use class instead of ID
[04:09:42] <toomus_> Tennis: The same problem => https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/3/
[04:10:13] <Cork> toomus_: sibling
[04:10:16] <Cork> find looks for children
[04:11:11] <Cork> toomus_: https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/4/
[04:11:37] <Cork> also i think ppl has already said this; box_id isn't valid
[04:11:51] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/5/
[04:12:01] <toomus_> Cork: I know, but I get #top-bar, then reference its parent .inner-box and then find .content.
[04:12:54] <toomus_> Cork: box_id is my helper attribute
[04:13:16] <Cork> toomus_: always prefix self invented attributes with data-'
[04:13:40] <toomus_> Cork: ah, ok
[04:13:56] <gemclip> toomus_ $("[id^=content").slideToggle();
[04:14:41] <Cork> gemclip: no, don't downgrade ids to attributes
[04:16:03] <toomus_> Let's focus on the problem: why boxes doesn't slide down liek facebook?
[04:16:24] <Cork> toomus_: cause elements is positioned from the top left
[04:16:35] <Cork> so if you animate the height they will slide up
[04:16:51] <Cork> (didn't know that was the question)
[04:17:17] <toomus_> go on
[04:17:17] <decx> wait this is what this is about?
[04:17:27] <decx> it's a css problem alright
[04:17:46] <toomus_> it looks like
[04:17:47] <Ice_Strike> Is there a way to reduce the condiction in the if condiction?
[04:17:51] <Ice_Strike> For example
[04:17:54] <Ice_Strike>  if (customerName == '' || customerName == '' || service == '' || outcome == '' || saving == '') { alert("Please Enter all the fields"); return false }
[04:18:57] <Cork> toomus_: https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/6/
[04:19:04] <Uhkis> Ice_Strike: something like $('input').each(function() { if ($(this).val() == '') { alert('Please Enter all the fields'); });
[04:19:42] <Cork> Ice_Strike:  if (customerName + customerName + service + outcome + saving == '') ?
[04:19:59] <decx> haha
[04:20:20] <Cork> but ya, the each loop is prob what you want
[04:20:32] <Uhkis> and yours is &&
[04:20:34] <toomus_> Cork: all inner-box should slide down, and only #top-bar should be visible in botttom of site, like facbook chat.
[04:20:45] <Cork> toomus_: you can't do it with the solution you have
[04:21:07] <Cork> toomus_: cause you have to animate the height of the inner-box instead of the content
[04:21:14] <decx> have .top-bar absolutely positioned
[04:21:20] <Cork> hmm or...
[04:21:26] <Cork> sorry scratch that
[04:21:27] <decx> no, .inner-box
[04:21:42] <beasty> hi Cork o/
[04:22:05] <Ice_Strike>  if (customerName + customerName + service + outcome + saving == '')
[04:22:07] <Biganon> Hi ! I put code (masonry code) in a $(function() { block, YET... it executes before my google fonts have loaded
[04:22:08] <Ice_Strike> Is this a joke?
[04:22:09] <Ice_Strike> lol
[04:22:11] <Biganon> which leads to problems
[04:22:16] <Ice_Strike> Uhkis thank you.
[04:22:26] <Biganon> isn't $(function() an alias for $(document).ready ?
[04:22:47] <Uhkis> Ice_Strike: that would work fine if all the elements were empty
[04:23:19] <toomus_> decx: can you modify my fiddle?
[04:23:44] <decx> i'm going to cook a dead animal now
[04:24:45] <Cork> toomus_: the thing is for this to work you have to absolute position the inner-box
[04:24:52] <Cork> to bottom: 0;
[04:24:58] <Ice_Strike> Ah ok
[04:24:59] <Cork> else you will have the effect you havbe now
[04:25:53] <Joelesign> Hi Everyone!
[04:26:05] <Joelesign> Please can someone direct me to a tutorial or a Codepen on how to make this kind of changeable background effect? http://lab.rayps.com/cc/
[04:27:30] <decx> toomus_: https://jsfiddle.net/fh1zy2ae/7/ ?
[04:28:02] <toomus_> decx: +100 points :)
[04:28:13] <decx> could do without assigning inline css but then i'd have to rearrange stuff
[04:29:58] <toomus_> Thank you all
[04:30:18] <Joelesign> Any idea please?
[04:30:54] <Uhkis> use the source, Joelesign
[04:31:19] <Cork> Joelesign: have a look at css3 @key-frame
[04:31:30] <Cork> and background-image gradients
[04:31:40] <decx> well animating gradients is a bitch
[04:31:45] <Cork> not really
[04:31:49] <decx> they have several gradient divs that they fade out
[04:32:05] <decx> and when they reach the front they get added to the back again
[04:32:20] <Joelesign> Thank you decx!
[04:32:35] <Joelesign> Do you have a link for a sample of tis kind of effect?
[04:32:58] <decx> the page you jsut linked :p
[04:33:13] <Uhkis> decx: damn you, i was waiting for you to give that same link back :D
[04:33:14] <Joelesign> >_<
[04:34:15] <Joelesign> Thank you, I'll digg into the source code of the page to see how they do it.
[04:34:48] <Uhkis> he used zepto instead of jquery, blasphemy!
[04:37:19] <decx> what do you mean cork "not really"
[04:37:46] <decx> pls show me how you animate a single element with gradient without just moving background-position
[04:38:47] <Cork> ah, right the image spec haven't landed in most browsers yet...
[04:38:54] <Cork> forgot that
[04:40:10] <decx> so that's coming?
[04:40:14] <decx> animating image-data?
[04:40:37] <Cork> image cross fading ya
[04:40:40] <Cork> chrome already have it
[04:40:45] <Cork> http://dabblet.com/gist/1931619
[04:40:56] <Cork> (behind a pref)
[04:41:03] <decx> huh
[04:41:15] <decx> interesting
[04:41:29] <Cork> and gecko have https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=546052
[04:42:53] <Uhkis> 3 years, nothing :-)
[04:42:58] <decx> until then: https://jsfiddle.net/z8Lhb0j9/ ^^
[04:44:08] <Uhkis> that's pretty cool actually
[04:45:50] <Joelesign> decx: http://codepen.io/quasimondo/full/lDdrF/
[04:45:56] <Joelesign> The same stuff. :)
[04:46:40] <decx> that is incredible expensive
[04:47:41] <Uhkis> my cpu meter says that's ~50% lighter
[04:49:10] <decx> shouldnt be
[04:49:40] <decx> maybe having a 400% size background opens up a leak
[04:51:30] <Uhkis> or maybe it's just browser being able to smp it
[05:02:27] <marahin> Cork: hey, you possibly up?
[05:02:41] <Cork> at 14:00? :D
[05:02:44] <Cork> yes i'm up XD
[05:02:47] <marahin> :D
[05:02:50] <marahin> didn't manage to get my things fixed,    $.when.apply(null, parse_servers()).done(add_servers());  still in my code, but the results dont print.
[05:02:55] <marahin> I managed to find a curious error tho
[05:03:00] <marahin> 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined'
[05:03:09] <marahin> which points to some code, let me paste it
[05:03:09] <Cork> marahin: done(add_servers()) remove the extra ()
[05:03:14] <marahin> oh
[05:03:16] <marahin> alright
[05:03:17] <marahin> one moment
[05:03:19] <Cork> done takes a function reference
[05:03:47] <marahin> Cork: what about parse_servers() tho?
[05:03:54] <marahin> shall it have ()?
[05:04:07] <Cork> marahin: that is expected to return the array of deferred objects
[05:04:12] <marahin> I see
[05:04:14] <marahin> ok
[05:04:23] <marahin> well, let me see if it works now w/o extra () @ add_servers
[05:09:09] <marahin> Cork: well, it worked now, however it printed: undefined(undefined) undefined
[05:09:10] <marahin> :)
[05:09:26] <Cork> marahin: did you check the fiddle i gave you?
[05:09:26] <marahin> seems like data is not being passed?
[05:09:36] <marahin> i've seen it, however I couldn't really get anything out of it
[05:09:50] <Cork> marahin: the callback function used arguments
[05:09:55] <Cork> you need to do the same
[05:17:42] <marahin> Cork: if I understand correctly, I should add .then(function(data){ return data; }); to the parse_servers() function?
[05:18:22] <marahin> uh, I think I am too new in JS to understand that ._.
[05:22:16] <brollypop> eh im braindead, can someone tell me why it doesnt work https://jsfiddle.net/0drx7f5d/?

[05:45:34] <adac> I have a function in which I set some default options. I call this function and I pass an option object that should be merged with the default options, but the options I pass they should overwrite the default ones if they contain the same values. How to do that? Is that possible with "extend" somehow?
[05:46:05] <twiceaday> hi all
[05:46:35] <twiceaday> i would like to ask one thing, if i have a table in flexigrid, what would be the best way of passing additional parameter from flexigrid to server?
[05:46:48] <twiceaday> if someone would be so kind to point me in right direction
[05:47:28] <Cork> adac: options = $.extend({}, default, options)
[05:49:40] <kschlesselmann> Cork: wb ;-) could you please elaborate your setTimeout() "hack" to fill the viewport with tablerows? I understood something like while (window.scrollMaxY <= 0) { window.setTimeout(append_data(), 0); } but this still is an endless loop
[05:50:06] <Cork> kschlesselmann: ya, i was very short on time when i said that :)
[05:50:31] <Cork> kschlesselmann: there are two options, 1. you know how much space each "new data set" takes
[05:50:38] <kschlesselmann> Nope
[05:50:39] <Cork> so you can add that amount in one batch
[05:50:54] <Cork> or 2. the height is unknown (and you can't even guess at it)
[05:51:00] <Cork> then you have to async add each element
[05:51:11] <Cork> and in a timeout give the browser time to redraw
[05:51:22] <Cork> so you can't use a for loop at all
[05:51:25] <kschlesselmann> Ah … so just take something > 0?
[05:51:30] <Cork> instead you have to loop with a function
[05:53:00] <Cork> kschlesselmann: http://jsfiddle.net/8jennnny/
[05:58:18] <adac> Cork, thank you very much!
[05:58:19] <kschlesselmann> Cork: Awesome, works like a charm. I modified it a little and now it's working quite nice :-) It actually depends on the browser render speed though how often the recursion happens … can you fix that it just fills the viewport and nothing more?
[06:12:25] <Absolute0> I have two event binds to a class. The first confirms the second performs some actions. How I prevent the second binding from being called if the first binding did not confirm?
[06:12:43] <Absolute0> I have e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation in the first bind but the second one is still called
[06:20:08] <Cork> Absolute0: you shouldn't use stopPropagation of events to try to control logic
[06:20:20] <Absolute0> stopimmediatepropogration did the trick
[06:20:25] <Cork> Absolute0: it makes the code very fradgile and cause things to break easy
[06:20:44] <Absolute0> Cork: I have class called .confirm which is handled by a function to confirm links
[06:20:55] <Absolute0> if yes go on; of "cancel" stop the link
[06:21:11] <Cork> Absolute0: then you should have one event handler and have it deside what function to call
[06:21:16] <Absolute0> I also have another class "ajax-call" which makes an ajax request and shows a popup
[06:21:22] <Cork> not blankly kill the event
[06:21:38] <Absolute0> Cork: these are generic classes used across the site
[06:21:44] <Absolute0> in this case the link is ajax
[06:21:51] <Absolute0> usually it's a regular one so it had no issues
[06:22:11] <Cork> Absolute0: if you in the future need to do something that relies on getting that event, that script won't be able to function
[06:22:22] <Cork> and it won't have a way to get around you breaking the event structure
[06:22:46] <Cork> it is much much better to leave the events alone, it makes maintaining the site in the long run much simpler
[06:23:16] <Absolute0> What can I do instead?
[06:23:19] <Cork> (this has bitten me in the past so i know how much biting are involved...
[06:23:51] <Cork> Absolute0: add a separate event handler that runs the confirm function
[06:24:00] <Cork> and based on the answer runs the second one
[06:24:09] <Absolute0> Think is confirms are not always necessary
[06:24:14] <Cork> Absolute0: you could special case it by having an extra class on the element
[06:24:15] <Absolute0> *thing
[06:24:25] <Cork> and have the other event handler not touch it if both are set
[06:24:32] <Cork> or have one event handler handle all
[06:24:37] <Cork> it both works
[06:24:48] <Absolute0> I'll leave it with stopImmediatePropogation if I notice an issue I'll try your suggestion
[06:25:05] <Cork> but stopPropagation and even more stopImidiatePropagation is normally something you should avoid
[06:25:11] <Absolute0> why?
[06:25:16] <Absolute0> I don't want anything else to happen
[06:25:20] <Absolute0> the user did not confirm the action
[06:25:33] <Cork> cause it states "i know nothing on this site except me will ever want to know about anything happening below this element"
[06:25:38] <Cork> for now and for ever
[06:25:56] <Cork> that is something one can normally can't guarantee
[06:26:01] <Absolute0> that's exactly what I want
[06:26:08] <Absolute0> the click was not confirmed!
[06:26:08] <Cork> you might
[06:26:15] <Cork> but if the page needs to be extended
[06:26:22] <Cork> it could only be done by rewriting your current code
[06:26:27] <Cork> THAT is the problem
[06:26:37] <Cork> you assume things not related to your code
[06:27:06] <Cork> its similarly to doing .removeAttr('class') instead of .removeClass('my classes')
[06:27:16] <Cork> cause "there is no other classes there" _yet_
[06:31:03] <Absolute0> Cork: you are wise beyond your years.
[06:31:56] <Absolute0> Cork: what's the difference between stopPropagation and stopImmediatePropagation?
[06:32:00] <Cork> Absolute0: been doing this for close to 20 years, not sure how beyond by years it is :)
[06:32:14] <Cork> Absolute0: stopPropagation prevents the event from bubbling up the tree
[06:32:26] <Absolute0> as apposed to?
[06:32:28] <Cork> stopImmediatePropagation prevents all event handlers bound after your to function
[06:32:38] <Absolute0> what do you mean by up the tree?
[06:32:42] <Cork> similartly to returning false;
[06:32:43] <Absolute0> The previous functions calls?
[06:32:51] <Cork> Absolute0: event bubbles
[06:33:04] <Absolute0> up the tree -> next binds?
[06:33:07] <Cork> it starts at the element it came from and bubbles up the parent structure to the document
[06:33:15] <brainysmurf> I'm trying to figure out how to use jquery tabs widget with packery
[06:33:15] <Absolute0> oh I see
[06:33:20] <Absolute0> so nothing to do with the current class
[06:33:25] <Cork> no
[06:33:30] <Absolute0> Just events on the parents
[06:33:35] <Absolute0> okay that's not what I need
[06:34:04] <brainysmurf> has anybody used packery with tabs before? The issue I'm seeing is that when changing tabs the items are not packed
[06:34:44] <Cork> Absolute0: could give you a little backstory to why stopPropagation (and by extension stopImmediatePropagation) is a problem to use
[06:35:00] <Absolute0> I have to run in about 5 minutes
[06:35:04] <Cork> Absolute0: i used it for dialogs i created to allow "click outside to hide"
[06:35:13] <Cork> and i made it work by stopPropagation
[06:35:29] <Cork> about a year later i needed a "logout on inactivity"
[06:35:44] <Cork> for it to function i needed to catch all mouse and keyboard actions
[06:36:03] <Cork> and guess what it broke all over the place cause it couldn't catch clicks from any of those dialogs
[06:36:11] <Cork> so ppl got logged out incorrectly over and over
[06:36:16] <Absolute0> stopPropagation equally bad as return false?
[06:36:24] <Cork> no
[06:36:28] <Absolute0> what's the difference?
[06:36:36] <Cork> return false === is stopImmediatePropagation
[06:36:46] <Absolute0> doesn't seem like it
[06:36:54] <Absolute0> because I had return false and the next event was fired
[06:36:54] <Cork> well + preventDefault
[06:37:06] <Cork> Absolute0: that shouldn't happen
[06:37:14] <Absolute0> it was..
[06:37:19] <Cork> return false kills the event handler dead in the tracks
[06:37:21] <Absolute0> maybe I am binding it twice
[06:37:44] <Cork> and ya, none of them is a good choice
[06:38:02] <Cork> you should have the event handler exclude the cases they don't want to handle
[06:38:09] <Cork> it is a much more robust way of building things
[06:38:27] <Cork> handle what you know, don't exclude what you don't know
[06:38:33] <Absolute0> http://dpaste.com/0395ZZ9
[06:38:58] <Cork> Absolute0: propagation and the like won't help there
[06:39:03] <Cork> Absolute0: you have bound it on document
[06:39:08] <Cork> there isn't anywhere to bubble from there
[06:39:16] <Absolute0> ?
[06:39:22] <Absolute0> please explain
[06:39:23] <Cork> document is the top most element on the page
[06:39:29] <Cork> it can't bubble higher
[06:39:38] <Absolute0> do you know why the next binding was called?
[06:39:44] <notchris> I’m trying to get the first option of this list to be Today
[06:39:45] <notchris> http://jsbin.com/dipica/1/edit
[06:39:53] <notchris> But I can only seem to get it to start from tomorrow
[06:39:56] <Cork> Absolute0: what next binding?
[06:40:13] <Absolute0> Cork: http://dpaste.com/2VAE53N
[06:40:33] <randomguy1> notchris: take off the +1 of the offset
[06:40:36] <Absolute0> In the client js I have Util.handleConfirmLinks(); Util.handleAjaxActions();
[06:40:56] <Cork> Absolute0: that will depend on if you have called handleAjaxActions(); handleConfirmLinks(); or handleConfirmLinks(); handleAjaxActions();
[06:41:16] <randomguy1> notchris: dayOffset = index,
[06:41:17] <Absolute0> the way I wrote above
[06:41:37] <Cork> Absolute0: i would recommend not to separate that logic, it makes thing fragile
[06:42:09] <Cork> Absolute0: instead i would move the code from the .ajax-action into a separate function
[06:42:23] <Cork> Absolute0: have the lower one do .ajax-action:not(.confirm)
[06:42:40] <Cork> Absolute0: and the above do the confirm check and if it confirms call the other function
[06:42:57] <Cork> that way you don't have to duplicate the code, but still have robustness
[06:43:11] <Cork> *but will still have
[06:43:44] <Absolute0> you're getting wiser by the minute!
[06:44:18] <Absolute0> I was thinking of refactoring out the logic from those binds but was too lazy...
[06:45:31] <Absolute0> How do I call a function such that this points to something I pass?
[06:45:49] <Cork> point to something you pass?
[06:46:07] <randomguy1> i think he means defining the context as a parameter
[06:46:28] <Cork> Absolute0: if you don't need old browser support func.bind
[06:46:38] <Cork> if you need old browser support use an anonymouse function
[06:47:25] <Absolute0> All this talk about binds makes me thing of BDSM
[06:47:26] <Absolute0> :/
[06:47:36] <Cork> heh
[06:47:59] <Cork> Absolute0: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[06:48:08] <Absolute0> thanks
[06:48:09] <Cork> doesn't work in ie < 9
[06:49:14] <randomguy1> ah, could he use .call() or .apply()
[06:49:20] <randomguy1> maybe what he was talking about
[06:49:28] <Cork> possibly, not sure
[06:49:29] <Absolute0> yeah call was it
[06:49:37] <Absolute0> apply is for a list...
[06:49:40] <Cork> ya
[06:50:02] <randomguy1> knew i had seen that functionality somewhere
[06:50:07] <Cork> man i still remember the day i found out about call/apply :)
[06:50:15] <Absolute0> Cork: How do I stop a link from going through if I don't do return false/stopPropagation?
[06:50:32] <notchris> randomguy1: Thank you man!
[06:50:37] <Cork> Absolute0: that is the point; you shouldn't :)
[06:50:40] <randomguy1> notchris: np
[06:50:50] <Absolute0> that's the first time hearing that!
[06:51:17] <Cork> Absolute0: instead if you want the event call event.preventDefalut() and do what you want with it
[06:51:18] <notchris> randomguy1: So on the JSbin it’s fine
[06:51:29] <notchris> randomguy1: But on the site I’m running, the index is not starting at 0
[06:51:37] <notchris> randomguy1: So all my dates are a month ahead
[06:51:41] <notchris> It’s very confusing
[06:51:54] <Cork> Absolute0: and for the events you don't care about, just don't touch them
[06:51:58] <randomguy1> notchris: do you -always- want it to start with current date?
[06:52:11] <notchris> randomguy1: Yes
[06:52:18] <Cork> Absolute0: you might want to always call event.preventDefault() if you want to always prevent the browser default event
[06:52:30] <Cork> but ya, you shouldn't control other event handlers from your code
[06:52:36] <Cork> they should do that them self
[06:55:55] <randomguy1> notchris: huh, according to docs, index of each() should always start at 0.
[06:56:32] <notchris> randomguy1: For some reason, the dates are correct, but the month is always one ahead, a workaround is...
[06:56:42] <notchris> randomguy1: moment().add(dayOffset,'days').subtract(1, 'months').format('MMMM DD, YYYY');
[06:57:02] <notchris> I guess it’s not bad, I’m worried about the number of days in a month
[06:57:08] <notchris> But I suppose it will calculate that
[06:57:09] <randomguy1> what's the date/time on your local machine?
[06:57:22] <notchris> Moment doesn’t take local time, correct/
[06:57:28] <notchris> ?*
[06:57:28] <randomguy1> dunno
[06:57:40] <notchris> Well, my machine time is equal
[06:57:46] <notchris> But, that was a good thought
[06:58:57] <Cork> notchris: moment is based around the Date object
[06:59:01] <Cork> so yes it is localtime
[06:59:03] <Zeranoe> Is there a way to automatically fill in an input field that is set for .datepicker() with the current date?
[06:59:42] <randomguy1> Zeranoe: there is an option in the documentation for that, on initialization
[06:59:42] <notchris> Cork: If you do not mind, can you look here: https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/tickets-peo/
[06:59:47] <Cork> Zeranoe: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[06:59:49] <notchris> Cork: Click general admission
[06:59:59] <notchris> Cork: Then refresh the page, and click it again
[07:00:14] <notchris> Select Add to Basket
[07:00:24] <notchris> There should be a date select, does it show April?
[07:01:27] <Cork> ya
[07:01:29] <Absolute0> If I remove a class in one event, will the next scheduled event not fire?
[07:01:49] <notchris> Cork: Interesting, thank you
[07:01:58] <Cork> Absolute0: depends on how you bind the event
[07:02:06] <Absolute0> ie: <span class="a b"> $('.a').click(function () { $(this).removeClass('.b');}
[07:02:12] <Cork> no
[07:02:22] <Absolute0> will that prevent any events triggered on .b from being fired?
[07:02:24] <Cork> if you bind them directly on the element, the class doesn't matter
[07:02:36] <Cork> cause there you only use the selector to find the elements
[07:02:45] <Cork> the event handler sits directly on the element
[07:03:05] <Cork> so if the selector matches later doesn't matter
[07:03:14] <Absolute0> ie: <span class="a b"> $('.a').click(function () { $(this).removeClass('.b');}); $(.b).click(function () alert(...));
[07:03:26] <Cork> both event handlers will always fire
[07:03:31] <Absolute0> always?
[07:03:34] <Cork> always
[07:03:41] <Cork> until you directly remove the event handler
[07:04:01] <Cork> $('selector') build a collection of the elements matching the selector
[07:04:15] <Cork> .click then loops this collection and adds an event handler to each element in the collection
[07:04:29] <Cork> after the initial selection that selector has no meaning
[07:04:39] <Cork> only the collection it created
[07:06:49] <notchris> Cork: I’m using the selector #dayselect :selected to get the value of the selected option on that date select
[07:07:14] <Cork> notchris: .val() on the select element should be enough
[07:07:15] <notchris> Cork: However, it will only list the first item
[07:07:29] <Cork> notchris: its a dropdown not a multiselect
[07:07:43] <Cork> you can only select one
[07:07:47] <notchris> I want to list the value of the selected option
[07:07:56] <notchris> But always shows the value of the first item
[07:08:03] <notchris> Ignoring what is selected
[07:08:15] <Cork> uh
[07:08:24] <Cork> select element doesn't work like that
[07:08:50] <notchris> How do I get the value of the selected item?
[07:08:51] <Cork> you can either make it a dropdown, then you have one select element and nothing else
[07:08:59] <notchris> Cork: That is fine
[07:09:04] <Cork> or you can make it a multiselect then you get a list
[07:09:09] <Cork> not a dropdown
[07:09:12] <notchris> I just need the value of the selected item
[07:09:39] <Cork> just do $('#dayselect').val()
[07:09:55] <Cork> and yes it will only give you one value
[07:10:06] <Cork> (as there can't be more in a dropdown)
[07:10:46] <notchris> Cork: I only expect one value
[07:10:55] <notchris> However, it is only giving me the value of the first item
[07:11:04] <notchris> Even if the third one is selected
[07:11:07] <Cork> ah
[07:11:11] <Cork> use .val()
[07:11:20] <notchris> I did, the same issue occured
[07:11:29] <notchris> Let me try to make a fiddle, one moment
[07:18:30] <notchris> Cork: You’re right
[07:18:32] <notchris> Cork: http://jsbin.com/volawe/1/edit
[07:18:40] <notchris> Works correctly, except on my site
[07:19:01] <Cork> notchris: you most likely have duplicate ids
[07:19:14] <Cork> use btw use $(this).val() inside the event handler
[07:19:28] <Cork> ugg, sorry read wrong
[07:19:31] <Cork> not same id >_>
[07:20:29] <notchris> Cork: Oddly, my ID’s are different
[07:20:49] <Cork> notchris: check $('[id="the-id"]').length
[07:20:56] <Cork> if that value is > 1 you have a problem
[07:21:32] <notchris> it’s 0
[07:21:51] <Cork> did you replace the "the-id"?
[07:21:57] <notchris> yes
[07:22:10] <Cork> did you include the #?
[07:22:15] <notchris> Yes
[07:22:17] <Cork> remove it
[07:22:18] <notchris> Cork: https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/tickets-peo/
[07:22:37] <rubyonrailed> Hey, I have a table table cell That updates it's text via jQuery.  But if the text is too long, it will overlap the table cell and the table cell wont expand.  Does anyone know a way around this?
[07:22:42] <notchris> Cork: Still 0
[07:22:46] <Cork> notchris: it should be something like console.log($('[id="dayselect"]').length
[07:22:49] <Cork> );
[07:23:03] <notchris> Cork: Yes, it returned 0
[07:23:13] <Cork> notchris: then the element doesn't exist
[07:24:27] <Cork> notchris: its an iframe
[07:24:32] <randomguy1> can you provide a fiddle rubyonrailed?
[07:24:35] <Cork> you can't select cross iframes
[07:25:29] <randomguy1> i'll learn these commands one day...
[07:25:34] <randomguy1> !paste rubyonrailed
[07:25:38] <notchris> Cork: I’ve authenticated it with CORS, I can.
[07:25:45] <randomguy1> or bot ignores me, >_<
[07:25:56] <Cork> notchris: i meant you can't select in it as if it is the current page
[07:26:06] <Cork> i didn't even check if it was cross domain
[07:26:10] <notchris> Cork: I know, I use frame.contents().find("#dayselect").val();
[07:26:29] <notchris> Cork: I am able to select the contents that way for everything else
[07:29:37] <notchris> Cork: Seems like this http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7889
[07:29:41] <notchris> Cork: I’m on Chrome
[07:30:12] <Cork> notchris: that is for setting though
[07:30:15] <Cork> your fetching
[07:30:24] <notchris> When I change an option on the select
[07:30:26] <notchris> On the front end
[07:30:30] <notchris> :selected is not applied
[07:30:38] <notchris> To whichever option I select
[07:31:06] <Cork> :selected is css it has little to do with .val
[07:32:16] <notchris> Cork: OK I see that however
[07:32:31] <notchris> Cork: Regardless of how “selected” can be applied
[07:32:44] <Cork> notchris: huh?
[07:32:50] <notchris> Cork: Changing an option on the front end on the select does not apply any additional values to the options
[07:32:58] <notchris> Options: 1, 2, 3, 4
[07:33:00] <Cork> you have problem with b so there problem a is...?!?
[07:33:04] <notchris> Nothing is selected
[07:33:06] <Cork> i don't follow how you connect them
[07:33:12] <notchris> I select 2
[07:33:15] <notchris> Nothing is selected
[07:33:31] <Cork> and by front end what do you mean?
[07:33:49] <notchris> Say I go to a site with a select
[07:33:52] <notchris> And it has 4 options
[07:34:09] <notchris> I select the 4th option by clicking on it and selecting the 4th option
[07:34:12] <notchris> Nothing happens
[07:34:25] <notchris> The 4th option does not have anything identifying it as selected
[07:34:49] <notchris> Even the default item, the first option does not come up as “selected”
[07:36:09] <Cork> notchris: i went to you site, went through the steps of going to the dropdown
[07:36:23] <Cork> selected "April 30, 2015"
[07:36:27] <notchris> Righ
[07:36:35] <Cork> $('#tickets iframe').contents().find('#dayselect').val() == "56213"
[07:36:39] <notchris> What is the iframe background?
[07:36:44] <Cork> so, wfm
[07:36:55] <notchris> Color
[07:36:58] <notchris> out of curiosity
[07:37:02] <Cork> white
[07:37:04] <notchris> Ok good
[07:37:23] <notchris> So it worked for yo?
[07:37:25] <notchris> you*
[07:37:41] <Cork> well i have to try a few times over cause the entire things is kinda buggy
[07:37:46] <Cork> but that comes from using iframes
[07:38:07] <notchris> Click the button though
[07:38:15] <notchris> The alert is supposed to show the selected items value
[07:38:40] <Cork> it just means your code is buggy
[07:38:52] <Cork> it is selecting for a place where the select element doesn't exist
[07:39:09] <notchris> It selects the first option value...
[07:39:13] <Cork> and the iframe thing makes debugging it kinda hard
[07:39:13] <notchris> So it is finding the select
[07:39:23] <notchris> Cork: I have no option to not use an iframe
[07:39:27] <notchris> Cork: This is a special situation
[07:39:33] <Cork> notchris: first make sure you found the select element with .length on the select
[07:39:38] <Cork> if MUST be 1
[07:39:49] <Cork> before you get there going further is pointless
[07:39:58] <Cork> after that just call .val() and you're done
[07:43:52] <gremlyn> I have a form .submit() that appears to work in all browsers except Safari, but I don't have Safari available on my Linux machine to test... pretty simple code though
[07:44:16] <notchris> Cork: It works in my browser console
[07:44:22] <notchris> but not in my code
[07:44:28] <notchris> frame.contents().find('#dayselect :selected').val();
[07:45:26] <gremlyn> this apparently doesn't want to work in Safari... https://gist.github.com/Gremlyn/f758d240926a9dc45651
[07:54:05] <bulletpete> hey anybody faced this issue...upload of a file only succeeds after a postback in jquery in struts application.
[07:54:36] <bulletpete> i append the file using formdata.append(')
[07:55:17] <bulletpete> i append the file using formdata.append('fileupload',$('#fileu').get(0).files[0]) in data of jquery
[07:55:34] <bulletpete> ajax...
[07:56:29] <bulletpete> i couldnt find the answer
[07:56:56] <workerbeetwo> Hi. how do I select
[07:57:19] <workerbeetwo> something like this: myForm:myField
[07:57:47] <workerbeetwo> $('#myForm:myField')  ?
[07:57:54] <randomguy1> what is myField?
[07:58:03] <randomguy1> a field on the form?
[07:58:04] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: and input field
[07:58:12] <NoiseEee> does it have a name?
[07:58:22] <NoiseEee> what is "myField" representing?
[07:58:29] <NoiseEee> a class?
[07:58:33] <NoiseEee> a specific input type?
[07:58:44] <randomguy1> $('formSelector inputSelector')
[07:58:52] <randomguy1> # for ids, . for classes
[07:59:03] <randomguy1> or [name="whatever"]
[07:59:11] <randomguy1> with the "'s
[08:01:16] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: the id is "myForm:myField"
[08:01:29] <randomguy1> oh, you have a : in your id="" ?
[08:01:59] <workerbeetwo> and its an input field fith class ui-inputfield introduced by a jsf
[08:02:53] <randomguy1> try $('#myForm\\:myField')
[08:03:35] <randomguy1> if what your saying is <input id="myForm:myField" />
[08:04:04] <workerbeetwo> yes and name is equal
[08:05:25] <Cork> workerbeetwo: ya, you really shouldn't use selector characters in ids
[08:05:29] <Cork> it gets messy
[08:06:36] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I did not do them in there.
[08:07:18] <workerbeetwo> I think its coming from jsf auto replacements.
[08:08:00] <Cork> ya, i know java does funky things like this all the time
[08:08:11] <Cork> i think at least old sharepoint sites did too
[08:11:46] <QuakePhil9000> I have draggable connected to sortable using connecttosortable and everything works fine.  But when I change the sortables to a grid style (like https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#display-grid ) then it breaks.  It seems like the float is what's breaking it... Can anyone give some clues how to make draggable work with a sortable that displays as a grid?
[08:13:36] <workerbeetwo> randomguy1: thank you . worked like a charme. I love this place. much better then a lot of other channels. Cork
[08:14:43] <Sander^work> How do I set a html class?
[08:14:56] <Cork> Sander^work: addClass
[08:16:13] <Sander^work> variable.addClass("classname") ?
[08:16:16] <Sander^work> Cork, ?
[08:16:26] <Cork> if variable is a jquery selection, sure
[08:21:48] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  html() returns the inner html of an element, is there a way to retrieve the html including the matched element?
[08:22:35] <MarcGuay> Hmm, seems like it would be easier to modify the markup.
[08:22:48] <Cork> MarcGuay: .prop('outerHTML')
[08:23:26] <Cork> MarcGuay: but ya, if you want to modify just one element you normally don't want to serialize it to html
[08:23:34] <Cork> cause the current state and all event handlers in it gets lost
[08:28:19] <decx> you can do all the things you want to do directly on your element
[08:29:51] <MarcGuay> Cork: Thank you
[08:30:15] <MarcGuay> I don't want to modify the element I want to capture the html.
[08:34:24] <garethdaine> Folks I’m using jQuery UI for a draggable and droppable interface but the elements that are sortable have a text area in them so I’ve tried to add a handle but it stops the sortable from working. Can you use items and handle at athe same time? http://kopy.io/n8QNi
[08:42:18] <Sal> is there a way that an upper div doesn't catch mouse click but lets it go to the div under it?
[08:42:40] <Cork> Sal: uh, you mean the other way around right?
[08:42:51] <Cork> events bubbles from child to parent
[08:42:55] <Cork> not parent to child
[08:43:18] <Sal> Cork, i have a mask div that takes the entire video (gray)
[08:43:32] <robertmaxrees> Cork there's also a capture phase :)
[08:43:40] <Sal> on that i need to show a centered div, so i need another full screen container to center it
[08:43:46] <Cork> robertmaxrees: true, but that isn't exposed in jquery
[08:43:52] <Cork> (or older ie)
[08:43:55] <Sal> but this contain, does not let click events go to the mask div
[08:44:14] <Cork> ok so ya, you meant the other way around :)
[08:44:27] <Sal> no child and parents
[08:44:35] <Sal> divs are fixed
[08:44:46] <Cork> ya?
[08:45:23] <Cork> Sal: if you have <outer><inner></inner></outer>
[08:45:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0a00kkx8/ so you don't want "parent" to react, but "child"?
[08:45:32] <Cork> the event starts at the inner and then bubbles up to the outer
[08:45:45] <robertmaxrees> use pointer-events: none; on #parent via CSS< or just don't bind a listener to it.
[08:45:56] <Cork> though that only works on really new browsers
[08:45:56] <Sal> cork, i'm trying to create a centered modal panel
[08:46:19] <robertmaxrees> sal https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[08:46:25] <robertmaxrees> brb
[08:46:29] <Cork> Sal: the question doesn't really make sense
[08:47:04] <Cork> Sal: do you want to do what robert talked about and click through the inner element, without it seeing it?
[08:47:06] <garethdaine> Anyone know if and how to use items and handle with jQuery UI sortable?
[08:47:17] <Sal> so i have a <div mask fixed></div> and <div container><div centered></div></div>
[08:47:19] <Cork> Sal: or what is it your asking
[08:47:23] <Sal> i first show div mask
[08:47:29] <Sal> and then div container
[08:47:41] <garethdaine> If I add a handle to the sortable function in this code http://kopy.io/n8QNi it doesn’t work
[08:47:42] <Sal> when user clicks on mask, i hide all
[08:47:55] <Sal> but, div container is covering div mask
[08:48:19] <Cork> and div container isn't a child of the mask?
[08:48:21] <garethdaine> I’d basically like to use the legend of the fieldset to sort the fieldsets
[08:48:27] <Sal> nop
[08:48:49] <Cork> ok, but you want the clicks on the container or any of its children to trigger as if it was a click on the mask?
[08:49:02] <Sal> the div mask is independent because i use it also for side panels
[08:49:24] <randomguy1> is this a z-index issue?
[08:49:29] <Cork> no
[08:49:36] <Cork> sal: ok, but you want the clicks on the container or any of its children to trigger as if it was a click on the mask?
[08:49:59] <Cork> i'm still trying to understand the problem i have an idea, but not sure
[08:50:15] <Sal> cork, on side panels its easy, vecause i'm not hrozontale centering them, so theu don't need any full width container
[08:50:26] <Sal> so, once the user clicks on mask, the panel closes
[08:50:27] <Cork> Sal: could you please answer the question?
[08:50:36] <Sal> but here, its the container that takes the clicks
[08:50:39] <Cork> ...
[08:50:40] <Sal> yes
[08:50:45] <Sal> its uyes
[08:50:54] <Sal> container click must go to mask click
[08:50:57] <Cork> ok, do you need to support ie older then latest?
[08:51:09] <Cork> meaning ie < 11
[08:51:25] <Sal> nah
[08:51:33] <Cork> then use the pointer event
[08:51:47] <Cork> set it to none on the container
[08:52:01] <Sal> oh thats it
[08:52:10] <Sal> i was doing background transparent
[08:52:11] <Cork> the css pref won't have any effect on ie <= 10 though
[08:52:11] <Sal> hehehe
[08:53:08] <Sal> ok, that did it
[08:53:09] <Sal> thanks
[08:53:14] <robertmaxrees> there's always https://github.com/jquery/PEP
[08:53:15] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[08:53:26] <robertmaxrees> wait that might not help.
[08:53:28] <robertmaxrees> i am tired today
[08:54:29] <garethdaine> Anyone got any ideas on my issue at all?
[08:54:54] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine i wasn't here - what's up?
[08:55:34] <garethdaine> Baiscally, I have this code http://kopy.io/n8QNi
[08:55:48] <garethdaine> I want to have the handle for the sortable items to use the legend of the fieldset
[08:56:05] <garethdaine> But when using items if I add a handle it stops sortable working
[08:56:28] <garethdaine> Essentially the fieldsets have a textarea in so I need to use a different handle other than the full fieldset
[08:58:01] <robertmaxrees> i think it might be helpful if you setup a fiddle, because this looks like one of those cases that requires markup to understand.
[08:58:25] <DragonPunch> oh hey Sal
[09:06:48] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to add/remove a class to a parent div based on the value of a radio button, but I need it to check the current value, not base the add/remove on click. This is what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/q2j0rxs1/3/
[09:07:45] <robertmaxrees> unrelated - i'ma blow your mind with a replacement for that IIFE / Document Ready combo.
[09:07:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q2j0rxs1/4/
[09:09:21] <robertmaxrees> so you want to explicitly add/remove the class, instead of using a .toggle()?
[09:11:56] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  I think I got it http://jsfiddle.net/q2j0rxs1/5/
[09:12:19] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:12:36] <islalobo> Not so much?
[09:12:38] <IceTrAiN> I was actually looking above to see if someone named 'unrelated' was asking about IIFE.   >_<
[09:12:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest avoiding trigger() if you can.
[09:13:03] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: that is a much nicer wrapper (for drupal)
[09:13:04] <robertmaxrees> since that means you're proxying logic through the DOM instead of explicitly calling things.
[09:13:44] <robertmaxrees> islalobo if you're shoving everything into a doc ready (which you really shouldn't do, but that's another discussion), doing it that way is less hacky than what you had before.
[09:14:13] <robertmaxrees> anyway!  is the issue that you're trying to add/remove the class on pageload?
[09:14:39] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: yeah, the radio will have a default value for that radio button depending on what is in the database
[09:14:40] <decx> disactivate haha
[09:14:51] <robertmaxrees> islalobo do that server-side then.
[09:14:59] <robertmaxrees> don't set default states in your JS.  that's gross.
[09:15:33] <islalobo> I'm not setting the default value in my js, I need to have the class added depending on the that value
[09:15:51] <robertmaxrees> default state, not value.
[09:16:04] <robertmaxrees> that class should be added server-side, instead of client-side.
[09:18:49] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure how to do that
[09:19:14] <robertmaxrees> by writing code in your backend?
[09:19:56] <robertmaxrees> you're setting the "off" one to checked by default, so there should be a way to add a class.
[09:20:40] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: that is just in the js for effect. I'm trying to add the class to the parent div
[09:20:51] <IceTrAiN> robertmaxrees: why is setting default state in JS gross? what about backends that just return json/
[09:21:25] <robertmaxrees> IceTrAiN if you're returning JSON, your templating engine should output your markup with the right default state.
[09:21:48] <robertmaxrees> coming back in after you've done all that transforming and rendering to add things via jquery is sort of roundabout.
[09:23:11] <IceTrAiN> ah, I see what you're saying
[09:23:17] <islalobo> I don't
[09:24:02] <robertmaxrees> islalobo you already have a default state by way of your HTML.  why are you coming in with JS after the fact to then update things to match the default state?
[09:24:40] <islalobo> I'm trying to add a class IF a certain radio IS checked
[09:24:54] <robertmaxrees> then you shouldn't need that extra .trigger() in there.
[09:24:58] <robertmaxrees> that was my entire point.
[09:26:07] <islalobo> Then it only works when it is checked, I need it to check the value on page load (which is coming from the database and is only set in jsfiddle for testing)
[09:26:28] <robertmaxrees> right - i'm saying that your server-side should be adding that class for you instead :)
[09:27:35] <IceTrAiN> islalobo: he's basically saying that if that state (the radio being checked) is already known prior to the data even being sent to the page, just have the backend add on the class that you want to the html that is generated
[09:27:35] <islalobo> I don't know how to alter html server side based on the form value. It's the a parent div that I want to alter and not the form itself
[09:28:40] <robertmaxrees> i imagine it shouldn't be too difficult.
[09:29:56] <robertmaxrees> you could create a var that holds an array classes to add to that particular div, check the DB for that div's child input for whatever value it is and append the class you want, then do a simple array join or whatever when writing the classes ouit.
[09:34:14] <islalobo> Okay, I think I kind of understand
[09:34:48] <islalobo> Thanks robertmaxrees
[09:36:31] <robertmaxrees> the whole idea is that you shouldn't need your javascript to come in after page load and sync everything up for you - the page should start out ready to go.
[09:39:40] <islalobo> That makes sense now. Going to give it a go.
[09:40:57] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[09:41:16] <robertmaxrees> just spreadin' the gospel.
[09:46:05] <Rainb> How could I serialize(htmlize) an object based on a constructor, but then refer to that object instead of the dom elements
[09:46:25] <Rainb> like when a event points to that element
[09:54:39] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:55:33] <robertmaxrees> Rainb that doesn't really make sense.  try again?
[09:55:53] <tasaif> sounds like he wants to clone an object and have it live outside the dom
[09:57:05] <tasaif> maybe
[09:57:06] <Rainb> say I have a bycicle constructor with bycicle properties and methods and stuff, and I make an HTML representation of this constructor, then add eventlisteners so when I click on it I call a method to this bycicle constructor, but when the event is triggered there's no reference to the constructor anymore
[09:57:19] <Rainb> hmm
[09:57:21] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[09:57:41] <tasaif> lol
[09:58:08] <Rainb> I think I got it tho.
[09:58:09] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you want a reference from a DOM node back to an object.
[09:58:12] <tasaif> Rainb: could you put your problem in a fiddle?
[09:58:29] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:58:47] <Rainb> tasaif: can it be pseudocodish?
[09:58:52] <tasaif> no
[09:59:07] <tasaif> I have a meeting in a minute
[09:59:14] <Rainb> Well, then I'm afraid it'll be long, 'xd', alright then.
[09:59:17] <tasaif> be back in 20ish to an hour
[09:59:54] <bepolite> ping arthurvr
[10:02:27] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[11:10:52] <Sal> hi, i'm using serialize() on form data di pass it with ajax to the server php
[11:11:06] <Sal> in the form, i have a textarea that is linked to ckeditor
[11:11:13] <Sal> so it contains html code
[11:11:50] <Sal> is there any trick to let this field to be accepted by serialize() ?
[11:14:57] <tasaif> back
[11:15:01] <tasaif> just lost my job
[11:15:09] <tasaif> what's up? anybody hiring?
[11:18:38] <robertmaxrees> Sal not sure what you mean.
[11:19:12] <robertmaxrees> tasaif sorry to hear that.
[11:19:13] <Sal> i'm just wondering if html code will be serialized correctly
[11:19:25] <robertmaxrees> Sal it should be, yeah
[11:19:33] <Sal> because its not saving the content
[11:19:39] <tasaif> thanks robertmaxrees
[11:19:39] <Kartagis> tasaif: :S
[11:19:41] <Sal> ok, so the problem is else
[11:19:50] <robertmaxrees> Sal does the textarea have a name attribute on it?
[11:19:58] <Sal> yep
[11:20:15] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you've got then?
[11:20:29] <Sal> i think i forgot to tell the editor to write back its content to the textarea
[11:20:32] <Sal> let me check
[11:22:02] <Sal> yep it was that
[11:22:06] <Sal> its working now, thanks
[11:40:45] <Juslintek> Hi, how to convert $('.thumb').live('contextmenu', function(e) { to $('.thumb').on('contextmenu', function(e) {, if I do it like that, the context menu stops working.
[11:43:06] <robertmaxrees> Juslintek http://api.jquery.com/live/ tells you
[11:43:12] <robertmaxrees> $( document ).on( events, selector, data, handler );
[11:45:08] <robertmaxrees> more specifically, $(document).on('contextmenu', '.thumb', function() {}); though preferably you'd bind lower than document.
[12:44:10] <islalobo> Hello what is the best way to trigger a callback when a radio button is clicked
[12:45:40] <coldhead> $(':radio').on('click', function () { console.log('ur code here'); });
[12:52:52] <BillCriswell> islalobo: If you only want to do it when the radio group changes you can do $(':radio').on('change', function () {});
[12:53:28] <islalobo> BillCriswell:
[12:53:34] <arthurvr> so hey everybody
[12:53:34] <arthurvr> what’s going on here today?
[12:57:17] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Nothing that fun.
[12:57:18] <BillCriswell> You?
[12:57:48] <arthurvr> has a busy day and getting late now
[12:57:58] <arthurvr> hanging out on github reading through stuff
[12:58:07] <arthurvr> ~had
[13:05:52] <islalobo> BillCriswell: can I do something like this? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/428f530befa9a2d5b7e5 I'm trying to make a call with our webservice based on the radio button selection
[13:10:24] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Nice nice.
[13:10:45] <arthurvr> BillCriswell: lol
[13:12:27] <BillCriswell> islalobo: You can do something like $('input:radio').on('change', function () { var value = $(this).val(); }); then do something with value.
[13:14:34] <BillCriswell> islalobo: http://jsbin.com/codadi/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:16:44] <jquery-slide-hel> Trying to get a div to resize while a div slides in: http://jsfiddle.net/1juvxadw/1/ I can't seem to get it to work, any suggestions?
[13:18:58] <islalobo> BillCriswell: how can I grab that value?
[13:19:34] <BillCriswell> islalobo: I just showed you.
[13:19:58] <BillCriswell> Look at your consoles dev tools.
[13:21:53] <islalobo> BillCriswell:  I see it, but I'm not sure how I can use it
[13:22:02] <islalobo> PS: thank you!
[13:24:10] <BillCriswell> islalobo: No problem.
[13:25:57] <BillCriswell> jquery-slide-hel: So you want the text to move around like that as it's sliding in from the left.
[13:26:34] <BillCriswell> so animate width and left pretty much?
[13:26:37] <jquery-slide-hel> BillCriswell yea
[13:27:14] <BillCriswell> Do you definitely need to use animate for this or would css transition suffice?
[13:28:19] <jquery-slide-hel> transition would be fine too as long as the div sliding left is hidden at first
[13:28:25] <islalobo> BillCriswell: I'm not sure how to get the value
[13:28:26] <jquery-slide-hel> BillCriswell
[13:28:49] <BillCriswell> islalobo: You use the variable named value in the example I gave you.
[13:28:55] <jquery-slide-hel> But I would of thought this is more of a jquery or am I wrong?
[13:30:04] <BillCriswell> jquery-slide-hel: It depends what you need to support, but CSS can accomplish most of this.
[13:31:00] <BillCriswell> jquery-slide-hel: http://jsbin.com/xemaga/2/edit?css,js,output
[13:31:40] <BillCriswell> jquery-slide-hel: Depending on your needs you can add position: relative; and use left: Npx; as well
[13:36:56] <islalobo> BillCriswell: I'm trying to mess around with it, but neither $value nor value work for grabbing that variablek
[13:38:09] <BillCriswell> islalobo: http://jsbin.com/codadi/2/edit?html,js,output
[13:41:07] <islalobo> BillCriswell: That doesn't work, I've changed the 'name' to match my radio button name and ensured that the js is attached to the form
[13:41:53] <BillCriswell> islalobo: If it works in the bin, but "doesn't work" with your code how can I possibly know the issue?
[13:42:54] <islalobo> BillCriswell: I appreciate the help, but I'm not seeing an "alert" happening anywhere in the bin
[13:43:18] <BillCriswell> islalobo: click a radio button.
[13:44:17] <islalobo> Yes, not thing happens
[13:44:48] <BillCriswell> Did you check the checkbox where chrome gives you the option to stop showing alerts from a website?
[13:44:48] <islalobo> I see a message "Alert is not defined"
[13:45:27] <islalobo> No
[13:45:40] <islalobo> Or, I don't think so
[13:46:05] <BillCriswell> not sure what happened there then, try this: http://jsbin.com/codadi/3/edit?html,js,output
[13:47:51] <islalobo> Thanks, it's something with firefox, I have to stop using firefox for developing
[13:48:11] <jquery-slide-hel> BillCriswell Thanks! I got it!
[13:48:42] <BillCriswell> jquery-slide-hel: Sweet.
[13:49:13] <BillCriswell> islalobo: I'm not sure it's firefox. could just be something ith jsbin. I'm too lazy to dig into that right now haha
[13:51:42] <islalobo> BillCriswell:  and I can use that value to, for example, call a function: myfunction($value);
[13:52:45] <BillCriswell> yeah, but i don't know why you keep putting a $ in front of value.
[13:53:00] <BillCriswell> typically only do that for jQuery collections, or you're a php person.
[13:53:06] <islalobo> BillCriswell: I'm just used to php :/
[13:53:15] <BillCriswell> got ya
[13:54:21] <islalobo> BillCriswell: where can I define that function?
[13:54:34] <islalobo> BillCriswell: Or I'll look that up later
[13:55:00] <BillCriswell> anywhere in that scope or an outer scope
[13:55:50] <islalobo> BillCriswell: inside that same little js function
[13:56:17] <islalobo> BillCriswell++
[13:56:27] <islalobo> Thanks, I'll have to come back to this. Have to run.
[13:56:37] <BillCriswell> islalobo: In there you'd be recreating the funciton over and over again though
[13:56:39] <BillCriswell> Ah, too late.
[14:01:11] <IceTrAiN> I wonder whatever happened to that guy who had gremlins on his mac...
[14:33:40] <robertmaxrees> everybody having fun yet?
[14:36:37] <tasaif> should I use an existing checkbox plugin or roll my own?
[14:36:51] <tasaif> (for the sake of styling)
[14:37:24] <tasaif> I want to be able to do $('input.checkbox').pretty_checkbox()
[14:37:33] <tasaif> and it uses font awesome icons
[14:40:56] <AtomicB0mB> does anybody know a responsive slider AND thumbnail jQuery plugin?
[14:41:36] <Sal> hi
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> you want something that does bvoth a carousel and a gallery?
[14:42:01] <Sal> does anyone know where i can find a sample on stucky subheaders for tables?
[14:42:08] <Sal> something like this: http://codepen.io/chrissp26/pen/gBrdo
[14:42:12] <Sal> but using tables
[14:45:36] <AtomicB0mB> robertmaxrees humm yes, its something like this: http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ResponsiveImageGallery/  - But the problems using this plugin, is that i can have only one slider per page =/
[14:57:08] <AtomicB0mB> robertmaxrees nothing ? =)
[14:58:28] <robertmaxrees> i don't know of any plugins like that, but you'll have more luck using the phrase "carousel" instead of "slider" i'm guessing.
[14:58:33] <igyiguygyu> Anyone has experience using scroll magic and willing to take a look at my code? Can't figure out why its behaving not the way I intend it to
[14:58:53] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ igyiguygyu
[14:58:53] <b-ot> igyiguygyu: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:01:19] <igyiguygyu> okay let me put it injsfiddle
[15:05:35] <igyiguygyu> it's a real mess I know - https://jsfiddle.net/h32fcuqk/
[15:06:21] <igyiguygyu> It says that those variables are defined already but I looked at the examples in scroll magic website and they reuse the same variables all the time.
[15:06:25] <robertmaxrees> why do you have a doc ready nested in a doc ready?
[15:06:43] <igyiguygyu> I have noidea
[15:06:49] <robertmaxrees> and just because they use them doesn't mean you should.
[15:07:07] <igyiguygyu> This is where it gets interesting -
[15:07:15] <robertmaxrees> there are also a lot of undeclared variables.
[15:07:33] <igyiguygyu> the tween that moves Y from 600-0 works perfectly with each scene trigger
[15:07:36] <igyiguygyu> responds great
[15:07:50] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on the page?
[15:07:53] <igyiguygyu> nop
[15:08:29] <igyiguygyu> the staggerFromTo is a bit different, as soon as i hit trigger 1 (which is only defined for first scene) all of them stagger
[15:08:32] <igyiguygyu> all 3 lists
[15:08:40] <igyiguygyu> the same with lines
[15:10:48] <igyiguygyu> what I'm really curious about why the each Y from 600->0 tweens work as intended
[15:11:11] <igyiguygyu> and rest of it shoots off at first trigger which is ".blurb"
[15:18:58] <igyiguygyu> robertmaxrees: any ideas?
[15:19:21] <robertmaxrees> without seeing a functioning example, nope.
[15:20:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix up all thge invalid code and see what happens from there.
[15:22:12] <igyiguygyu> I could upload the html file possibly?
[15:29:12] <dan_j> Hi all. Hopefully a quick question. Is there a way to animate the rotation of an image or DIV using jquery or similar? It's an animation of a tape desk.
[15:34:08] <igyiguygyu> transform:rotate(1deg);
[15:34:09] <igyiguygyu> ?
[15:34:13] <igyiguygyu> its css
[15:58:38] <dan_j> Can it be looped without causing problems?
[16:40:19] <marahin> https://gist.github.com/Marahin/fca96ecd37fa374ad690 halp
[16:40:53] <robertmaxrees> parse_servers isn't a promise
[16:41:17] <marahin> robertmaxrees: have I mentioned that I'm a total newb in javascript and jquery? :P
[16:44:49] <marahin> robertmaxrees: well, uh... How do I make it a promise?
[16:45:15] <marahin> typing 'return' in every line? :P
[16:46:04] <robertmaxrees> there's an easier way to do this - any reason you need ot use that particular promise pattern?
[16:46:38] <marahin> robertmaxrees: not at all, I just need to fill the array and then use the data when the site loads up
[16:46:57] <snover> make one request, not server_adrs.length requests
[16:47:14] <marahin> snover: why not?
[16:47:28] <snover> because you don’t hate your users?
[16:47:30] <marahin> can you do n-requests at the same time?
[16:47:44] <marahin> snover: I'm a noob, don't expect me to read your mind :P
[16:47:46] <snover> it doesn’t matter if you can do them at the same time, the speed of light is not mutable
[16:48:01] <snover> one request = at least one round trip
[16:48:25] <marahin> well how should I ask for them then, assuming I have multiple urls?
[16:48:30] <marahin> (possibly from different sources)
[16:49:03] <snover> do you know what CORS is?
[16:49:43] <marahin> uh... something related to being able of accessing data on remote servers?
[16:50:13] <snover> you can’t make requests to other servers than the one the page is hosted from unless the server you are trying to request data from allows you to do it
[16:50:25] <marahin> well yeah, I know that
[16:50:34] <marahin> the servers I'ma ccessing the json objects from do have the special headers
[16:50:43] <marahin> the '*' wildcard
[16:51:11] <snover> and you care not about browsers that do not support cross-origin requests?
[16:52:05] <marahin> snover: all or most of the users rather have the new browsers
[16:52:10] <marahin> which - i assume - should support it
[16:52:28] <marahin> for now i want it to work, then I will learn what to do to support the old ones
[16:52:29] <marahin> step by step, sir
[16:52:40] <snover> if you care then you don’t do it this way
[16:52:51] <marahin> well now I dont, now I want it to work
[16:53:04] <marahin> I have two functions, which I can't get to work one after another by the site startup
[16:53:07] <snover> Promise.all(serverAddresses.map(function (address) { return fetch(address).then(function (data) { return new Server(data.name, …); }); })).then(function (servers) {})
[16:53:24] <marahin> holy mother of...
[16:53:49] <marahin> snover: what is fetch()?
[16:54:19] <snover> any retriever of data that accepts an address and returns a promise
[16:54:39] <marahin> uh... and why not $.getJSON()?
[16:54:50] <Sal> hi
[16:55:02] <Sal> can someone help me finish this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WveNyZ?editors=011
[16:55:30] <snover> the short answer is because as far as i know jquery’s promises are still retarded
[16:55:45] <Sal> i forked a codepen that was made for <divs> and <p> and tried to convert it for table
[16:55:53] <robertmaxrees> snover that's... not OK.
[16:55:53] <snover> anyway, that’s the one-liner
[16:56:17] <Sal> but there's still something wrong in it
[16:56:43] <Sal> and also, i don't think that putting a <div> wrapper arounf a <tr> would be accept by all nrowsers
[16:58:01] <marahin> snover: well how do I access the data then? It returns it, but where?
[16:58:22] <snover> `servers` holds your server objects, you access them from there
[16:58:56] <DragonPunch> oh look who it is again...
[16:58:58] <DragonPunch> it's sal..
[16:59:10] <Sal> :)
[16:59:19] <DragonPunch> *cough* *cough* namethief *cough* *cough*
[17:00:57] <Sal> DragonPunch, are u italian?
[17:01:03] <marahin> Uncaught ReferenceError: fetch is not defined
[17:01:04] <marahin> snover:
[17:03:56] <Sal> hmmm DE
[17:04:01] <Sal> you german
[17:04:09] <Sal> you're german
[17:17:38] <AllOutWar> hey all, wondering if someone can help me figure out how to do a string replace on a big block of html using jquery. I'm trying to change a bunch of class names and id names and arbitrary attribute values from "xxxtab01xxx" to "xxxtab02xxx" where the x's can vary from tag to tag
[18:47:16] <wheeei> whats the point in wrapping in a some code that calls initilize a plugin in a anonymous function? Seems to work excatly the same regardless if its inside $(function () { }); or not...
[18:49:18] <wheeei> is it to trigger it auto if its not already in another wrapper. I guess i put most already in a document ready function and thats why the anonmous function becomes obsolete
[18:53:12] <shoky> wheeei: $(function..) is just a shortcut for $(document).ready(function..)
[18:54:04] <wheeei> shoky ahh okay, makes sense why the plugin kept having it in every demo :) thanx!
[19:48:39] <JavaDog> Alright guys, I've got a tough question: I'm using jquery-ui to make an element resizable, and I need to set the minWidth of my dynamically-generated element based on its current width when it's first appended to my page.
[19:49:00] <JavaDog> However, calling $element.width() immediately after appending returns 0
[19:49:47] <JavaDog> There is a workaround a la stackoverflow where you can setTimeout(function() { $element.width() }, 0) to get the correct width by waiting one tick (I guess)
[19:50:41] <JavaDog> however, I can't use that because by the time the tick has passed, a new width will possibly be assigned to the element based on a database query, messing up what I had originally wanted as minWidth for the resizable library
[19:50:45] <JavaDog> So. What to do?
[19:51:45] <JavaDog> I just need the width of a dom element immediately after it's been appended to the page. It's not hidden or anything.
[19:53:54] <JavaDog> This is the SO thing I referred to: http://stackoverflow.com/a/6132918/1079597
