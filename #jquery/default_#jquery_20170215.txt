[00:01:02] <sillyslux> you could use $.get().done(function(data){/*do something with data*/}) http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/#entry-examples
[00:03:03] <otahak> thanks sillyslux - I actually ended up doing it this way: $('#previewpopup').load($url+' #content');
[00:03:24] <sillyslux> yess
[00:39:28] <tecknicaltom> hello all. I've got a decent amount of dev experience but I'm just now trying to catch up on some of the ways js dev has advanced and design patterns and such. I have a big site that has a static js file for each specific endpoint that has different functionality. most of them are one big $(function() {... }) with several functions and code to run on document ready. I'm now looking to modernize and add some qunit testing. I've reorg'ed one js fil
[00:59:38] <jak2017> exist a way for know the number of days in a month? i want the user choose(selec/option): Year, choose(select/option) Month, and then select the day, but if user choose February ..... (Note actually i use the jquery datetime picker, but the user want 3 select/option) any advice?
[01:22:56] <Zythyr> Need help. I created an element using the function "element = document.createElementNS(a,b)". How can I conver this element object into JQuery element object
[01:23:49] <tecknicaltom> can't you just use $(element) ?
[01:27:02] <Zythyr> tecknicaltom So can I do elementNew = $(element) ? Sorry I am a newbie to Javascript. I am actually building something in AngularJS which uses JQuery Lite for some stuff
[01:31:33] <tecknicaltom> you can do $(element), or create the element with jquery $('<span></span>')
[01:32:56] <tecknicaltom> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-ownerDocument When the parameter has a single tag (with optional closing tag or quick-closing) — $( "<img />" ) or $( "<img>" ), $( "<a></a>" ) or $( "<a>" ) — jQuery creates the element using the native JavaScript .createElement() function.
[01:34:26] <Zythyr> tecknicaltom Thanks. Let me see if it works.
[01:43:14] <Cork> Zythyr: though, you can't use that one if you need a namespace (as NS stands for)
[01:43:31] <Cork> it will always use the default namespace
[01:44:29] <tecknicaltom> ah, I didn't notice the NS there
[01:44:59] <Cork> the best you can use then is $(document.createElementNS())
[01:45:39] <Zythyr> I am creating SVG elements using createElementNS. However this element is not a JQuery element, so I can't use fucntions like element.attr(). Will I have issues if I use createElementNS() and then convert it to JQuery element after?
[01:46:07] <Cork> Zythyr: ya, just wrap it in $()
[01:46:26] <Cork> and ya you can't create svg elements with $('')
[01:48:07] <Zythyr> Will I have issues If I do element = $(document.createElementNS(ns,'svg')) then element.setAttributeNS();
[01:50:44] <Zythyr> Actually it doesn't work
[01:51:04] <Cork> no
[01:51:24] <Cork> you need to use element[0].setAttributeNS
[01:51:34] <Cork> as the element is now a jquery wrapped element
[01:52:04] <Cork> alternatively you can do element = document.createElementNS(ns,'svg'); $(element).show()
[01:52:33] <Zythyr> Ohh okay. So correct me if I am wrong. If I have a JQuery element given by elementJQ, I can convert it to regular element by doing elementJQ[0]
[01:52:35] <Cork> (so you where at the right direction before, but you expressed the question wrong)
[01:52:46] <Cork> yes
[01:52:55] <Zythyr> awsome! Thank u very much
[01:52:58] <Cork> [0] will just give you the first element if there is more then one
[01:53:30] <Zythyr> Now it make since why in the past I had to use [0].
[01:54:04] <Cork> btw most of the time you don't need to use setAttributeNS
[01:54:20] <Cork> most svg attributes don't have a namespace so you can just use $().attr()
[01:55:09] * Cork is waiting for svg 2.0 where most of this sillyness is removed
[01:57:03] <Zythyr> How do I know if an attribute requires a NS or not?
[01:58:53] <Zythyr> I created my root SVG using svg = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "svg");  then parentElement.append(svg);.  The resulting SVG didn't even have the "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" as part of the definition.
[02:05:45] <Cork> Zythyr: attributes that has a : in them do
[02:06:05] <Cork> the only svg element that does (as far as i remember) is the <svg> element
[02:06:42] <Cork> (and event there it is optional)
[02:08:42] <Zythyr> Ohhh okay. Thanks for the calrification. I read this article and didn't understand what they meant until your calrified https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course
[02:40:21] <Moin> hi guys, can anyone help me with jquery and ajax problem?
[02:43:54] <Moin> i am new to jquery and ajax . i have an issue with .ready not getting fired after an page is loaded via ajax.
[02:44:49] <Cork> Moin: .ready is a event hook that is about when the document is constructed
[02:45:05] <Cork> as the document isn't torn down when you run ajax, it doesn't get called
[02:45:28] <Moin> some know solutions are to modify existing codes of jquey  eg: $(document).ready(function () {     AjaxInit(); });  $(document).ajaxComplete(function () {     AjaxInit(); });
[02:45:29] <Cork> Moin: also ajax only supports page fragments
[02:45:55] <Moin> will have to move all the fuctions to AjaxInit();
[02:46:11] <Cork> Moin: make a jsfiddle.net with the context of what you're trying to do (it doens't have to run)
[02:46:14] <Moin> and i cant remodify all the exiting codes.
[02:46:35] <Moin> ya , please wait
[02:50:58] <Moin> @cork have a look herehttps://jsfiddle.net/cdv9e943/1/
[02:51:32] <Cork> hmm that gives no context at all
[02:53:10] <Cork> Moin: but ya, if the page is constructed to run on dom creation and no built in way to call it after the fact
[02:53:19] <Cork> partial loading it with ajax will be hard
[02:54:16] <Moin> you are right.
[02:57:53] <Moin> Cork : any idea if $.holdReady()  can help me ?
[02:58:23] <Cork> it can't
[02:58:35] <Cork> the ready event has already been called
[02:58:50] <Cork> holdReady doesn't call it again, it just delays calling it
[02:59:22] <Cork> in your case you want to make an ajax call and run related ready code
[02:59:32] <Cork> and jquery has no way to know what "related" is there
[03:01:02] <Moin> yes, was thinking if i find a way to merge "the google location" with holdready delay all.ready code .
[03:01:54] <Cork> Moin: if you are ok with not executing .ready code at all until the ajax call is mada (and this only happens once) then you can use holdReady()
[03:04:54] <Moin> yes, i would like to give it a try . thanks for mentioning "this only happens once".
[03:08:45] <Moin> Cork can you help me to merge holdready  with the function in jsfiddle(just need help in the base, so i can get started )
[03:09:42] <Cork> Moin: there is an example in the jquery api page
[03:09:58] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.holdready/
[03:10:11] <Cork> just replace getScript with ajax and you have the basic idea
[03:11:02] <Cork> also, for obvious reasons this can't access the dom
[03:11:32] <Cork> (as it can't wait for the dom to be ready as that means .ready)
[03:12:48] <Moin> thanks a lot, i will start working on it.
[04:57:44] <mareosa> Hi guys, anyone know some good effects to put into this image ?
[04:57:45] <mareosa> http://luxuria-s.com/index_prize_new
[07:44:10] <YokoBR> hi folks
[07:44:23] <YokoBR> what can i use in place of ".parent().parent().parent().parent().parent()" in a dynamic content?
[07:53:35] <xenaxon> hello
[07:53:40] <xenaxon> can someone help me?
[07:54:06] <xenaxon> I want to make 2 adjacent divs resizable in 20% steps, in relationship to each other
[07:54:22] <xenaxon> I have some ideas on how to do it, but nothing concrete yet
[07:56:16] <dglambert> morning
[07:56:31] <xenaxon> hi
[07:56:48] <xenaxon> you have any idea how to do that?
[07:56:53] <xenaxon> I want to make 2 adjacent divs resizable in 20% steps, in relationship to each other
[07:57:06] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/genpsire/4mywcm1x/14/
[07:57:34] <xenaxon> i found this, however resizable only works in pixel dicrements and increments
[07:57:47] <xenaxon> I want o make it work in 20% steps
[08:16:41] <Cork> YokoBR: use .closest('selector-matching-the-wanted-parent')
[08:17:19] <Cork> so for example add a class to the parent you want to target and use .closest('.the-class')
[08:49:55] <xenaxon> Cork: any idea on how to do what I asked?
[08:50:03] <xenaxon> @all guys, need some help
[09:26:38] <Cork> xenaxon: sorry i'm a bit busy right now, could you distill that down to a specific question?
[09:29:28] <xenaxon> Cork: how can i resize 2 adjacent divs at the same time, in 20% steps of total container space
[09:29:29] <xenaxon> ?
[09:29:47] <xenaxon> as specific as I could :))
[09:30:05] <Cork> xenaxon: by step you mean you want to have the extra space at the end or?
[09:30:21] <xenaxon> no, I mean
[09:30:54] <xenaxon> Cork: When I resize them, the resizing needs to snap to 20% intervals
[09:31:13] <Cork> ya, sure
[09:31:22] <Cork> but that will mean that one of two options has to be true
[09:31:33] <Cork> 1. the result can be > 100%
[09:31:36] <xenaxon> so instead of them resizing pixel by pixel, I want them to snap to 20%
[09:31:39] <xenaxon> 20%, 40%
[09:31:42] <Cork> or 2. there can be unused space somewhere
[09:31:54] <xenaxon> why?
[09:32:00] <xenaxon> if one is 20% the other is 80%
[09:32:07] <xenaxon> if one is 40% the other goes 60%
[09:32:18] <xenaxon> and vice versa
[09:32:35] <Cork> so take 100 - the value you use for the first element
[09:32:44] <Cork> and set that value for the second
[09:33:00] <xenaxon> yes but, the resizable doesnt let me snap to % intervals
[09:33:27] <xenaxon> it snaps to pixels
[09:33:31] <xenaxon> 20px 100px ...etc
[09:33:33] <Cork> ah, i didn't notice you use resizable
[09:33:42] <xenaxon> well, is there any other way?
[09:33:47] <xenaxon> I would do it custom, if I knew how
[09:34:03] <xenaxon> but I'm afraid it's too much hassle compared to just finding a fix/hack for resizable
[09:34:31] <xenaxon> I am thinking of using resizable as is, and making a separate JS calculation that snaps to 20%'s
[09:34:37] <Cork> i don't think resizable supports percent
[09:34:48] <Cork> if you used pixels you could use grids
[09:34:52] <Cork> *grid
[09:35:02] <xenaxon> yes but
[09:35:14] <xenaxon> the container resizez dinamically depending to viewport size
[09:35:23] <xenaxon> so... snapping to fixed px's is no good
[09:35:26] <Cork> yes i know
[09:35:40] <xenaxon> :(
[09:35:41] <Cork> what i meant i don't know if there is a way to do that with that plugin
[09:35:52] <xenaxon> what I am thinking is...
[09:35:59] <Cork> i've rarely used it, i usually just use simple mousemove events
[09:36:23] <xenaxon> well, how do I resize them by mousemoove?
[09:36:47] <xenaxon> detect mouse press, and upon mouse moove, adjust?
[09:37:02] <Cork> just set a value on mousedown and change the size based on the mousecursor position change from the original start position
[09:37:07] <Cork> it is fairly straight forward
[09:37:24] <Cork> and there you have why percent is hard to impossible to do
[09:37:28] <xenaxon> so that means doing this zone between the 2 divs
[09:37:38] <Cork> cause it is very hard to translate the xp value to a percent in code
[09:37:48] <xenaxon> just need it to snap
[09:38:00] <xenaxon> I could use it as it is, with PX
[09:38:02] <Cork> ya, but you can't really snap to percent
[09:38:06] <Cork> that was my point
[09:38:15] <xenaxon> yea
[09:38:25] <xenaxon> all i need is to just limit the flexibility of the resizing
[09:38:32] <xenaxon> to not let the user resize to just about anything
[09:38:41] <xenaxon> I need to have some standard div sizes for the 12
[09:38:44] <xenaxon> I need to have some standard div sizes for the 2**
[09:39:03] <Cork> ya, you could see if you could override the resize position in the resize event
[09:39:16] <xenaxon> because if the divs are like 1. is 12.7% and one is 87.3...
[09:39:21] <Cork> and then you will have to round the value to the nearest allowed value
[09:39:32] <Cork> but ya, can't really help you there
[09:41:03] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/genpsire/4mywcm1x/14/
[09:41:13] <xenaxon> I'm thinking on using this
[09:41:29] <xenaxon> and just rounding the end result
[09:41:46] <xenaxon> with a limit at 10% minimum size
[10:06:00] <btracht> i am using jquery to load external link into a div on my webpage...
[10:06:11] <btracht> is it possible to load https in a div on http?
[10:07:29] <Cork> no
[10:07:42] <Cork> you can't load full documents into an existing element
[10:07:50] <Cork> and you can't do cors with ajax
[10:07:54] <Cork> you need to use iframe for that
[10:10:09] <btracht> thanks
[10:50:55] <laravelnewbie> hello
[10:54:58] <laravelnewbie> I have multiple instances of a div and I want to access one of them for example
[10:55:03] <laravelnewbie> how can it be achieved?
[11:10:00] <laravelnewbie> anyone?
[11:42:14] <djlee> Are there any examples of jquery plugins that use es6 (as the source obviously) and more importantly uses classes rather than prototypes
[11:49:08] <Es0teric> i have not used the .bind() method in a while so i have a quick question about it -- what if i want to bind to a toggle event (like a radio button) and only let a submit run when the toggle event's radio button is selected on a specific one
[11:49:21] <Es0teric> my question is -- how would i go about that?
[11:49:28] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what version of jq are you using?
[11:50:36] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees -- jq 2.x
[11:51:24] <taplar> you should use on() instead of bind() fwiw
[11:51:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd swap to .on() in that case since it was superceded a while.
[11:51:31] <robertmaxrees> *a while ago
[11:51:40] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees alright so then on toggle?
[11:51:45] <robertmaxrees> on change.
[11:51:48] <robertmaxrees> .on('change'
[11:51:52] <robertmaxrees> and then check the .val()
[11:52:08] <Es0teric> gotcha... i knew it was something like that
[12:00:23] <taplar> i want to get away.  i want to fly away  yah yah
[12:00:38] <robertmaxrees> we actually do Are You Gonna Go My Way in my band.
[12:01:36] <taplar> nice
[12:04:47] <taplar> kinda happy.  i didn't realize bestbuy would price match newegg.  *grins*
[12:04:52] <Juinn> hey guys im having a little trouble with clicking data attr  https://jsfiddle.net/jyy0k26f/
[12:05:25] <Juinn> when you click delete i don't want it to activate href click
[12:05:36] <taplar> try not to select by data attributes.  that's not their purpose.  use a class or id instead
[12:05:39] <Juinn> any help would be greatly appreciated
[12:05:50] <taplar> also you should use data() to get/set their value
[12:06:06] <Juinn> this will be data from my database
[12:06:18] <Juinn> ok
[12:06:32] <Juinn> i will change that
[12:06:44] <taplar> ok, so clicking delete, don't activate href...
[12:06:52] <Juinn> yes please
[12:07:05] <taplar> oh, stop the propagation when that delete is clicked
[12:07:11] <taplar> e.stopPropagation()
[12:07:20] <taplar> it will keep the event from bubbling up to the other event handler
[12:07:48] <taplar> you'll want to pass the 'e' into that handler
[12:08:30] <Juinn> taplar can you show me on that fiddle please?
[12:09:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jyy0k26f/1/
[12:09:59] <Juinn> i see
[12:10:18] <taplar> comprende?
[12:10:32] <Juinn> indeed...so i dont need this line if (!$('td', this).attr('data-network-contract-id')){
[12:10:45] <Juinn> taplar: thank you very much
[12:10:53] <taplar> sure
[12:33:11] <mareosa> Hi, guys anyone know any good effect to put on this image upon load ?
[12:33:13] <mareosa> http://luxuria-s.com/index_prize_new
[12:33:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of time to make users wait to see content.
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> for a second i thought it was justt an image and almost left mareosa
[12:35:18] <taplar_luncha> that's how important that award was man
[12:35:24] <taplar_luncha> obvinously
[12:35:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:36:12] <robertmaxrees> i really wish decent pageload and perf was considered as shiny as effects and stuff.
[12:36:15] <taplar_luncha> it's like being a rocker.  you don't play your music.  you just wear a shirt with your logo and the panties drop
[12:36:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[12:36:31] <mareosa> robertmaxrees: i want to change that effect upon load
[12:36:36] <mareosa> know any good ones ?
[12:36:41] <robertmaxrees> even betetr - wearing your own shirt is a major faux pas
[12:36:52] <robertmaxrees> mareosa sure - make the page load faster
[12:37:14] <mareosa> i dont want to make it faster
[12:37:24] <robertmaxrees> so you'd rather have people leave the page?
[12:37:33] <mareosa> i want to know if there's some good effects besides the fade in i've there
[12:37:37] <robertmaxrees> weird.  figured you'd want people to stock around.
[12:37:39] <robertmaxrees> *stick
[12:37:56] <mareosa> that's for me to decide not for you
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> actually that's for your analytics, but either way.
[12:38:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd stick with the fade.
[12:57:48] <tsukasadt> Is that a jQuery function that will allow me to wrap child text not in a child element in a specified element? Here's a basic example: https://jsfiddle.net/63csbh47/ The function would target the DIV and would wrap the text not in a child element in an element.
[12:58:54] <taplar_luncha> afaik, you'd have to find the parent, getContent(), then only wrap those that were textNodes
[12:59:32] <taplar_luncha> http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[13:05:06] <taplar> is there a reason you cannot change the original markup?
[13:05:22] <taplar> *ooc
[13:05:39] <tsukasadt> taplar, asking me?
[13:05:52] <taplar> yep
[13:06:13] <tsukasadt> Because it's a third-party product where all I can do is add JavaScript and CSS.
[13:06:23] <taplar> cool.  just checking
[13:06:44] <tsukasadt> I'm trying to write a function to do what I'm looking for, but I figured I'd ask if there was already one.
[13:06:59] <taplar> afaik there is not a single method to do what you are after
[13:08:02] <tsukasadt> k, ty
[13:08:44] <taplar> but give contents() and look.  it should help you accomplish your goal.  if you hit a snag with it feel free to ask again
[13:08:54] <taplar> and = a
[13:09:33] <tsukasadt> I'm using .children().each() to compare the text() values.
[13:09:49] <taplar> children will not select text nodes
[13:10:00] <taplar> which is why you need contents().  it does
[13:10:36] <tsukasadt> Ah, I misunderstood. ^^'
[13:12:19] <tsukasadt> If I remember correctly, the nodeType for text is 3?
[13:12:27] <taplar> yeah
[13:13:06] <tsukasadt> Okay, so I can do .contents().each(.filter()), I think.
[13:13:31] <taplar> you may also want to conditionally check if your text trimmed has any length.  if your markup has new lines there can be many text nodes that you do not want to wrap
[13:14:18] <tsukasadt> Ah ha! There's actually an example of exactly what I'm trying to do on the contents documentation page. xD
[13:14:38] <taplar> nice
[13:15:57] <tsukasadt> https://jsfiddle.net/63csbh47/1/
[13:16:07] <tsukasadt> Perfect! Thank you, taplar. :D
[13:16:42] <taplar> all you man, :)
[13:17:56] <tsukasadt> You gave me the correct function to use. I was writing a real elaborate function of comparing the full text() of the element to the text() of the children(). This is MUCH simpler. :)

[13:22:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9m3z0osd/2/  what is not working?
[13:22:44] <A___> Right, well it should remove the gender selection if 'A' is not selected

[13:23:04] <taplar> there is only one option for type in that fiddle.  it cannot 'change'
[13:23:08] <A___> so it should be removed by default
[13:23:15] <A___> it can hide though no?
[13:23:20] <taplar> bindings do no fire automatically

[13:24:25] <taplar> you can use trigger() to make the event happen if you want
[13:24:36] <A___> ah
[13:24:41] <A___> thank you :)
[13:27:46] <A___> hmm, fiddle works but my version doesn't
[13:49:36] <surial> I keep having to write something like: if (bool) thingie.show(); else thingie.hide();
[13:49:44] <surial> Is there a .setVisible kind of thingie
[13:50:15] <robertmaxrees> could write that yourself.
[13:50:35] <surial> that's a good point.
[13:50:41] <surial> The simple answers, huh?
[13:50:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:30:06] <A___> Hey, it seems my site doesn't even run the script
[14:30:16] <A___> I made a console.log and nothing was printed
[14:30:32] <A___> fiddle.net works with the same jquery code though
[14:30:39] <A___> any ideas?
[14:30:41] <A___> I am using django
[14:30:45] <robertmaxrees> you sure your file is even included?
[14:32:07] <A___> there are no static files, my script is embed in the html
[14:32:14] <robertmaxrees> err, so it's static?
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab and make sure it's not a 404./
[14:32:24] <robertmaxrees> also: clear cachje
[14:48:19] <A_> sorry I got disconnected
[14:48:22] <A_> you were saying?
[14:49:09] <taplar> have you cleared your cache and tried again?
[14:50:02] <A_> which cache?
[14:50:09] <taplar> your browser cache
[14:51:33] <A_> I can use a different browser instead, but the results are the same
[14:51:44] <cr34ton> Hello, I am using AJAX to save some data in my database. Is it possible to simultaneously post and get data?
[14:51:53] <cr34ton> what is best practice?
[14:52:11] <taplar> cr34ton: multiple ajax requests can happen at the same time
[14:52:21] <taplar> A_: any console errors?
[14:53:00] <A_> no
[14:53:06] <cr34ton> any example? What i want to achieve is to first post the data and immediately get the data to show it on the page.
[14:53:23] <cr34ton> should i make two seperate ajax requests?
[14:53:34] <taplar> cr34ton: in the case you can't do the multiple requests.  you'll want to make the post request and in it's success callback do the retrieval
[14:53:45] <taplar> or make the post return the latest updated info
[14:53:54] <taplar> probably the most efficient
[14:54:47] <cr34ton> ok, so in my php file i have to insert the data and after data i have to select all the data?
[14:55:04] <taplar> that is an option, yes
[14:55:14] <cr34ton> ok nice to know :)!
[14:55:34] <cr34ton> @taplar thank you for your time
[14:55:40] <taplar> sure
[14:57:36] <A_> taplar any ideas on my case?
[15:00:52] <taplar> not really.  if you don't have any console errors, and you've cleared your cache, and it still doesn't work.  something else is going on
[15:02:07] <A_> yeah
[15:02:07] <A_> ..
[15:02:45] <taplar> have you tried logging the length of the selector right before the binding to make sure the elements exist?
[15:04:07] <A_> . I don't think I follow you there
[15:04:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9m3z0osd/4/
[15:06:56] <A_> I am not getting anything
[15:07:10] <taplar> nothing is logging?
[15:07:17] <A_> As far as I am aware the console tab should have some output, there is none
[15:07:19] <robertmaxrees> check your page source to make sure the code actually exusts?
[15:07:23] <A_> it does
[15:07:43] <taplar> are you sure the logging is enabled for your console?
[15:07:55] <taplar> what browser are you in?
[15:08:42] <taplar> or better yet, does the logging show up in that same browser for the fiddle?
[15:10:31] <A_> Opera
[15:10:42] <A_> it does show up in the fiddle
[15:10:49] <A_> oh wait the log
[15:10:54] <A_> I'll check
[15:11:35] <A_> Where should it appear?
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> your browser's developer tools.
[15:12:25] <A_> Sorry I am really rather horrible with javascript :(
[15:13:39] <taplar> i have no clue about opera's dev tools
[15:13:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:13:50] <robertmaxrees> and opera's a weird browser.
[15:14:10] <taplar> you can try hitting F12 to see if it pops them open.  i'm still googling to try to get some insight
[15:14:42] <A_> Yes the console.log prints in the fiddle
[15:14:55] <taplar> and for your site?
[15:15:37] <A_> Nope
[15:15:47] <taplar> and no errors
[15:16:07] <A_> I have other browsers, if you would that I'd rather use something else
[15:17:09] <taplar> if you saw the log on the fiddle, your logging is on.  so if you've verified that the code is there on your local, and you are not seeing the log, and there are no errors.
[15:17:23] <taplar> that.... seems unlikely
[15:17:44] <A_> but it's true
[15:17:56] <A_> I mean I am sure it's a silly error but still
[15:18:08] <A_> perhaps it has to do with the way my script is declared?
[15:18:21] <taplar> no, you're in a doc ready so it doesn't matter where it is placed
[15:18:33] <taplar> and it's between <script></script> right?
[15:18:35] <A_> yeah
[15:18:42] <A_> src is google's server
[15:18:51] <A_> and type is text javascript
[15:18:54] <taplar> can you paste into a fiddle or something verbatum the logic you havre?
[15:19:17] <taplar> your not sticking this logic inside the script tag that is importing jQuery are you?
[15:19:36] <A_> ughhh, I am
[15:19:38] <A_> is that bad?
[15:19:39] <taplar> no dude
[15:19:41] <taplar> lol
[15:19:51] <taplar> one tag to get jquery.  another for this script
[15:20:04] <A_> so just a plain script?
[15:20:06] <A_> no values
[15:20:11] <taplar> right
[15:20:17] <taplar> the contents of the script is the value
[15:20:50] <A_> Hey-o, it works :D
[15:21:08] <taplar> awesome
[15:21:16] <A_> needlessly wasted 2 hours on something cosmetic but whatever :P
[15:21:27] <taplar> learning experience.  not wasted
[15:21:34] <A_> Thank you very much, I hope I wasn't that much a burden :)
[15:22:16] <taplar> if you were i'd have let robert berate you, :P
[15:22:34] <A_> lol
[15:22:38] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahhaa
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[15:22:42] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:33:04] <tucan> omg i still cant figure this Typeahead thing to work
[15:35:43] <A_> Well thank you :)
[15:35:54] <A_> if I have other problems I'll come back :D
[15:48:55] <jerit> I was going to do this with a $(selector).hide(400) for each element, but I figured this might be more efficient... It should work, right? $(".contact-form, .message-field, .submit-button").hide(400);
[15:58:26] <taplar> jerit: should work
[15:58:59] <jerit> taplar it does :) I'm so glad to have ended this day on jquery
[15:59:16] <jerit> server work just isn't my thing and gets incredibly frustrating
[16:00:57] <taplar> ah, i can imagine
[16:34:04] <tucan> anyone here use Typeahead https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead#usage
[16:35:54] <tucan> i include jquery , bootstrap3-typeahead.min.js , is there anything else i'm supposed to be including
[16:36:46] <tucan> or anything i'm supposed to do to enable the plugin
[17:01:08] <saul>  $('#CartContents').on('change', 'input', function(e) <- I'm trying to use .trigger to make this happen withour duplicating code
[17:01:15] <saul> is .trigger the right approach ?
[17:01:24] <Cork> yes
[17:01:35] <Cork> make sure you run .trigger on the input though
[17:01:41] <robertmaxrees> why not just pull the function out, give it a name, and then call the function?
[17:01:50] <saul> robertmaxrees: i was thinking about that
[17:01:52] <taplar> man, Cork doesn't sleep
[17:01:54] <saul> this is what im trying atm: $('#CartContents').trigger("change");
[17:02:03] <saul> doesnt seem to work though
[17:02:08] <robertmaxrees> saul like cork said
[17:02:08] <Cork> saul: wrong target
[17:02:12] <robertmaxrees> needs to be on that input
[17:02:19] <saul> ahh i
[17:02:21] <saul> i see what you mean
[17:03:21] <saul> the drag is that the inputs are dynamically added using jquery, so i'm not sure i have a way of specifying one
[17:03:37] <Cork> saul: $(
[17:03:39] <Cork> opps
[17:03:42] <saul> robertmaxrees: i thought of the named function
[17:03:54] <Cork> saul: $('#CartContents input').trigger() should work
[17:04:00] <saul> would there be any issue with using $(this) in that acse
[17:04:01] <saul> Cork: hmm ok
[17:04:06] <saul> i'll try that
[17:04:39] <saul> yes!
[17:04:40] <taplar> that seems odd.  if no input exists i wouldn't think the jquery would having anything to iterate over to trigger on
[17:04:42] <saul> nailed it Cork
[17:04:50] <taplar> weirdness
[17:04:59] <Cork> but ya, calling the function directly is cleaner, thought that might make it a bit complictated if you used $(this)
[17:05:22] <saul> Cork: yeah that was my concern
[17:05:34] <saul> i'd have to pass the input object to the function i guess?
[17:05:39] <Cork> ya
[17:05:41] <saul> pass $(this) to the function
[17:05:43] <saul> it can be done
[17:05:44] <robertmaxrees> or give 'em a class.
[17:05:46] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[17:05:49] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do it.
[17:05:49] <Cork> functionName.call(theElementName)
[17:06:37] <saul> havent worked with classes yet in js/jquery
[17:06:48] <robertmaxrees> saul sur eyou have.
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> .classname
[17:06:55] <saul> lol ok
[17:07:03] <saul> but i havent declared classes of my own
[17:07:10] <saul> sadly this project was accelerated and i had to cut corners for Mark 1
[17:07:15] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:07:19] <saul> the legacy system i am replacing up and died
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> you've never put classis in your html?
[17:07:26] <saul> robertmaxrees: oh
[17:07:27] <robertmaxrees> *classes
[17:07:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:07:32] <saul> those classes
[17:07:32] <robertmaxrees> that's what i mean./
[17:07:37] <saul> lol
[17:07:48] <saul> yeah for sure, i was thinking of Classes
[17:07:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean js classes.
[17:07:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:09:48] <taplar> mmm i love accelerated projects
[17:13:37] <saul> taplar: it's nice to see things "Working" sooner than they would have
[17:13:49] <saul> but i had more elegant designs i had to sideline
[17:14:00] <saul> i made a branch called "hurryup"
[17:14:22] <saul> but now i have lots of good code in there mixed with the bad, we'll see how it goes when it comes time to clean it up
[17:14:27] <taplar> just gotta be careful.  proper architecture shouldn't be under valued.
[17:14:53] <taplar> coding debt sux
[17:14:55] <saul> yeah i agree, but the legacy system is broken and people are doing stuff over the phone until i get mark 1 released
[17:15:40] <saul> plus i have never worked with node or jquery or javascript, OR bootstrap before this, i  started 2 months ago
[17:15:52] <saul> but now i'm almost done with the first working version
[17:15:59] <taplar> damn.  sink or swim
[17:16:00] <saul> about to move it to the production environment actually
[17:16:25] <saul> the hardest part of all of this was learning to work asynchronously
[17:18:07] <taplar> if I might ask, what kind of app is it?
[18:04:08] <Darmani> How do you validate dates in jQuery?
[18:04:22] <robertmaxrees> "validate dates"?
[18:04:52] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Make sure the value is a date
[18:04:56] <Darmani> and make sure it's not in the past.
[18:05:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do that.
[18:05:02] <robertmaxrees> use moment.
[18:05:05] <Darmani> Q.Q
[18:05:08] <Darmani> oh duh
[18:05:44] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: You always say something simple and I always feel stupid
[18:05:47] <Darmani> you make people feel stupid
[18:05:48] <Darmani> lol
[18:05:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[18:05:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't mean to!!!
[18:06:02] <Darmani> fuck lol
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> just gotta remember the tools you got.
[18:06:05] <robertmaxrees> that's all hahaha
[18:06:12] <robertmaxrees> plus people make things too hard on themselves.
[18:06:14] <robertmaxrees> it's batty.
[18:06:19] <Darmani> tru
[18:14:16] <Darmani> ahem
[18:14:19] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9
[18:15:12] <robertmaxrees> btw always always always use ===
[18:15:33] <taplar> heh, where's the return in that method?
[18:15:49] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[18:16:13] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9#file-validate_date-js-L5
[18:16:21] <Darmani> wait ===??
[18:16:22] <Darmani> Why
[18:16:35] <robertmaxrees> == coerces things around.
[18:16:46] <robertmaxrees> you should know what types you're using, always.
[18:17:13] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9#file-validate_date-js-L7
[18:17:13] <Darmani> here?
[18:17:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:17:40] <robertmaxrees> also } else if (validate_date(form_date) == false) { no need to compare here.
[18:17:44] <robertmaxrees> } else if (!validate_date(form_date)) {
[18:17:52] <kandinsk1> hi, I'm fixing some old code and know very little jquery, can't figure out how to remove elements from the working selection. Ill explain what I need in pseudocode: we call a function like this: `$(selector).prop('checked', checked)`, and I want to do `$(selector).but_not_things_with_class('.dontcheck').prop('checked', checked)`
[18:18:06] <robertmaxrees> basically, you always want === save for some special cases.
[18:18:18] <Darmani> ah
[18:18:23] <taplar> kandinsk1: .not('.thatOtherClass).prop(...
[18:18:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:18:30] <taplar> missed a closing '
[18:18:34] <kandinsk1> I seem to be able to remove the selected elements from the DOM, instead of removing them from the aaah thanks taplar
[18:18:38] <kandinsk1> awesome
[18:22:48] <taplar> oh, and also that should be prop('checked', true)
[18:23:23] <robertmaxrees> something tells me he's passing a bool to that.
[18:23:33] <taplar> oh, you think that's a variable?
[18:23:43] <taplar> makes sense
[18:23:49] <robertmaxrees> there are no quoes around it.
[18:23:58] <robertmaxrees> *quotes
[18:24:42] <taplar> i'm thinking about placing my monitor order this evening, :D
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> dooo iiiit
[18:25:15] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9
[18:25:16] <taplar> x34 baby
[18:25:21] <Darmani> Had to update the code.
[18:25:23] <Darmani> Still good?
[18:25:35] <robertmaxrees> ......
[18:25:41] <robertmaxrees> "hey you should always use ==="
[18:25:45] <robertmaxrees> start_date == "" || end_date == ""
[18:25:46] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:26:03] <Darmani> force of habit
[18:26:04] <Darmani> my bad
[18:26:09] <robertmaxrees> also: empty strings are falsy, so you could instead to if (!start_date || !end_Date)
[18:26:15] <robertmaxrees> but some people aren't a fan.
[18:26:25] <taplar> return (check1.isValid() && check2.isValid());
[18:26:34] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[18:26:44] <taplar> in the method, no need for the explicit if
[18:27:04] <Darmani> javascript is my second language q.q
[18:27:08] <kandinski> taplar, robertmaxrees, yes, both 'selector' and 'checked' were variables with the selector string and the boolean value respectively. Thanks again!
[18:29:08] <taplar> also is there a reason that validate_dates is not a more global function?
[18:29:26] <taplar> how often is this logic expected to be called?
[18:31:38] <Darmani> well this is all out the window because isValid(); in moment.js doesn't do what I think it does :/
[18:32:00] <Darmani> And this will only be called when a user tries to create an event so I think it's fine where it is.
[18:32:17] <robertmaxrees> put the functiond efinition outside.
[18:32:22] <robertmaxrees> of the click hander, that is.
[18:32:29] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're redefining it every time you call that3 handler.
[18:32:47] <robertmaxrees> and i'd keep digging around - google's your friend here :)
[18:33:03] <taplar> isValid() just checks format it seems
[18:33:14] <Darmani> taplar:  ^
[18:33:25] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: oh I guess you're right
[18:45:15] <taplar> huh, though the is valid docs say it should catch invalid stuff, not just format
[18:45:44] <Darmani> taplar: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9
[18:46:01] <chrispg21> im trying to add IDs to dom elements that are created by another script but I cant seem to access them
[18:46:03] <Darmani> This should work. It isn't but it should.
[18:46:25] <chrispg21> im assuming because they are loaded late
[18:47:12] <robertmaxrees> chrispg21 access them how?
[18:47:48] <chrispg21> robertmaxrees: im trying to make a jquery object and modifiy attribute
[18:47:58] <chrispg21> but its always empty
[18:48:45] <robertmaxrees> you can only select after they've been created.
[18:49:32] <chrispg21> theres nothing special to do like with event delegation?
[18:49:44] <chrispg21> target a container
[18:50:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.  just gotta select after they've been created.
[18:50:21] <robertmaxrees> are you creating them after an ajax call or something?
[18:50:31] <chrispg21> problem is im not creating them
[18:50:39] <chrispg21> so im not sure when its happening
[18:51:10] <chrispg21> so ur saying i just have to load my script later?
[18:51:27] <taplar> Darmani: http://momentjs.com/docs/#/query/  probably can't use < or >
[18:51:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:51:35] <robertmaxrees> how are they getting created?
[18:51:49] <Darmani> taplar: yeah you can. I did it in the console.
[18:52:32] <Darmani> I'm guessing this line might be the problem? https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9#file-validate_date-js-L13
[18:52:45] <Darmani> maybe !validate_dates doesn't work if you have more than one argument?
[18:52:52] <taplar> you did x < y and it was true and then you tried y < x and it was false?
[18:53:00] <chrispg21> robertmaxrees: its in the wordpress admin section. I was hoping to avoid having to find out what script is creating them
[18:53:10] <Darmani> yep
[18:53:29] <robertmaxrees> chrispg21 you just gotta make sure you code runs after they're created.
[18:53:59] <chrispg21> so theres nothing like event delegation on load? If i do i on click i can add the IDs
[18:55:28] <Darmani> taplar: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9#file-console-log-js
[18:56:00] <robertmaxrees> chrispg21 not really.  there are some native JS options but they're kind of gross./
[18:56:16] <taplar> weird.  by the existance of the query methods i would have thought that would not work
[18:56:49] <Darmani> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:56:55] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: help meeeeeeee
[18:58:22] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[18:59:01] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I'm stuck. This should work and it isn't and I'm frustrated q.q
[18:59:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm lazy
[18:59:15] <robertmaxrees> got a test case or something?
[18:59:24] <chrispg21> ok thanks robertmaxrees ill try and load later
[18:59:35] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: A test cae?
[18:59:37] <Darmani> case*
[18:59:44] <robertmaxrees> like a jsfiddle
[18:59:48] <Darmani> oh
[18:59:59] <Darmani> no :[
[19:00:26] <robertmaxrees> why not make one?
[19:01:14] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I guess if I have to...
[19:01:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to.
[19:01:56] <robertmaxrees> but we're all playing guessing games.
[19:02:09] <robertmaxrees> why not make it easier foir everybody involved?
[19:02:28] <Darmani> yeah that's true.
[19:02:55] * taplar shakes magic 8 ball  "will jsfiddle encourage robert to participate?" ..... "Outlook good"
[19:03:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[19:03:15] <robertmaxrees> a bit.
[19:03:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm rushing on shit so my involvement might still be limited.
[19:03:32] <robertmaxrees> i'll try tho!
[19:03:54] <taplar> i think that's going around.  l8r
[19:04:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[19:06:00] <Darmani> I GOT IT
[19:06:03] <Darmani> I FUCKING KNEW IT
[19:06:12] <robertmaxrees> figure it out by trying to make a fiddle?>
[19:06:28] <Darmani> no I wanted to try something before I made a fiddle
[19:06:47] <Darmani> This line here doesn't work if you have two arguments. https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9#file-validate_date-js-L13
[19:07:08] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:07:12] <robertmaxrees> clarifyu?
[19:07:27] <Darmani> what's there to clarify...
[19:07:28] <Darmani> o.O
[19:07:51] <robertmaxrees> what do you mnean "if you have two arguments"?
[19:07:54] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine.
[19:08:43] <Darmani> I don't know what to tell you... I had to change the code to this.
[19:08:44] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/633f73099e263a9122ba9cd4cc068ae9#file-validate_date-js-L4
[19:09:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:09:11] <robertmaxrees> ooooh
[19:09:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahha
[19:09:20] <Darmani> ...
[19:09:47] <robertmaxrees> your original statement and what you did are two different things.
[19:10:10] <Darmani> wat
[19:10:13] <robertmaxrees> !validate_dates(start_date, end_date) and validate_dates(start_date, end_date) === false shoiuld do the same thing
[19:10:23] <robertmaxrees> but both are passing two arge.
[19:10:26] <robertmaxrees> *args soooo
[19:10:37] <Darmani> soooo....?
[19:11:44] <robertmaxrees> what did the original version return out of validate_dates(start_date, end_da ?
[19:12:08] <gambl0re> hey robert
[19:12:17] <gambl0re> still at work?
[19:12:17] <Darmani> Well the original version was just validate_date(singular_date_here)
[19:12:36] <robertmaxrees> i mnean with the two args and the explicit if check.
[19:12:51] <robertmaxrees> put differently, (check1 < moment() || check2 < moment()) returns true
[19:12:59] <Darmani> oh rly
[19:13:02] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing up your true/false.
[19:13:51] <robertmaxrees> you wanted } else if (!validate_dates(start_date, end_date)) { but you wanted return (check1 < moment() || check2 < moment())
[19:13:54] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[19:14:01] <Darmani> ah
[19:14:08] <robertmaxrees> simple
[19:14:31] <Darmani> didn't feel simple
[19:14:33] <Darmani> but it always is
[19:14:35] * Darmani sighs
[19:14:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:14:44] <robertmaxrees> just gotta pay attention to what you're returning.
[19:14:56] <robertmaxrees> is check1 < moment() || check2 < moment() checking if it's valid?
[19:15:03] <Darmani> thanks mang
[19:15:09] <Darmani> uhh
[19:15:13] <Darmani> yeah
[19:15:15] <Darmani> wait
[19:15:22] <Darmani> no it's checking if it's invalid
[19:15:32] <robertmaxrees> rather, it's invalid if either date is before today?
[19:15:37] <Darmani> yeah that's right
[19:15:55] <robertmaxrees> heh, so then your logic shoulda been return (check1 > moment() || check2 > moment())
[19:16:03] <robertmaxrees> because that's what that function is saying.
[19:16:21] <Darmani> that's what I thought I had though...
[19:16:35] <robertmaxrees> check the gt vs lt
[19:16:39] <Darmani> oh I had it backwards
[19:16:40] <Darmani> I see
[19:16:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:16:52] <Darmani> dam
