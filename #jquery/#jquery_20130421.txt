[00:03:12] <gundas> Hey all, I'm trying to use json xpath to grab the first value and associated second value in separate path calls. Does anyone know how I can do this? Json is here http://pastie.org/7679118
[00:05:00] <raj> Jan\, what do you mean?
[00:07:24] <fredl> good morning all.
[00:10:13] <fredl> simple question, I think, as I've been out of jquery for a while.... I have a <div style="display: none">BLA</div> behind a click handler. When clicked, I would like to display BLA in a popup so I use $(this).next('div:hidden')
[00:11:25] <fredl> that however evaluates to Object... I understand the <div> is an object, but what's the proper function to access BLA instead of the div itself again?
[00:11:57] <fredl> I thought it would be $(this).next('div:hidden').contents() but doesn't seem to work either.
[00:22:00] <raj> fredl, are you using alert()?
[00:41:27] <fredl> raj - nope, I'm not, why?
[00:41:55] <fredl> I simply have something like:
[00:42:33] <fredl> <div putaclickhandleronthis>HTML</div>
[00:42:51] <fredl> <div style="display:none">BLA</div>
[00:43:13] <fredl> and when the HTML div is clicked I want jquery to fetch BLA and display it.
[00:43:30] <fredl> oh you mean in the popup part? No, well I'm using qTip.
[00:46:52] <raj> fredl, can you make a fiddle?
[01:06:42] <Lucaszz> Hi
[01:06:43] <Lucaszz> !
[01:07:10] <Lucaszz> Could you explain me why in my case "find" works, but "closest" doesnt works?
[01:07:11] <Lucaszz> http://pastebin.com/rwV6r00t
[01:10:40] <raj> Lucaszz, they're opposites
[01:12:03] <Lucaszz> find is searching INWARDS  dom tree closest towards the outside?
[01:29:26] <devslash> is there a way to get the name of the first selector  whose id matches a pattern like beginning with "security_"
[01:29:54] <roryhughes> hi
[01:44:56] <bluesm> Is there a way to validate my code in jsLint ?
[02:09:22] <nastus> anyone around familiar with CKEditor?
[02:17:32] <nastus> anyone around familiar with CKEditor?
[02:27:11] <Lucaszz> Can I aks you ?
[02:29:25] <Lucaszz> are any possibilities to change direction of slideUp/slideDown?
[02:30:06] <Lucaszz> for example I want to build "rising menu" (opposite dropdown menu)
[02:51:41] <fredl> a fiddle?
[02:53:15] <fredl> Im simply asking for a reminder of what function to use to get to BLA when I have <div style="display:none">BLA</div>
[02:53:53] <Gazpacho> .text()
[02:53:53] <b-ot> Gazpacho: usually nicer
[02:53:54] <fredl> ok...
[02:54:02] <fredl> thanks Gazpacho :)
[03:00:35] <fredl> Gazpacho, if the text() between the <div>... </div> is HTML, would that still work?
[03:02:02] <fredl> oh I guess that's where I'd use html()
[03:15:28] <Jan\> raj the div I want to hide is in an object tag and its not working :/
[03:16:17] <raj> Jan\, I don't know what you're talking about without more description or code
[03:18:21] <Jan\> raj the div Iwant to hide is inside <object type="text/html" data="page.html">
[03:18:50] <raj> ok
[03:18:55] <raj> so?
[03:19:19] <raj> you mean its inside another html page?
[03:19:33] <Jan\> yes, loaded from the object tag
[03:20:42] <Jan\> raj but I can't modify what's in the page.html
[03:22:23] <bahamas> hi. I'm having some issues with jquery.ui.slider on chromium. clicking on the slider path to the right of the slider doesn't move the slider to that position
[03:22:55] <bahamas> another issue is that when clicking the slider directly and immediately after starting to drag it, it jumps to the right
[03:23:01] <bahamas> anyone have any idea what the issue is?
[03:23:03] <Jan\> raj do you know what to do ?
[03:23:53] <ufk_> hello
[03:24:05] <ufk_> is there a query rewrite thingy that will work on any browser ?
[03:24:56] <raj> Jan\, 1) I suppose because you are trying to modify before the content loaded by `object` is loaded 2) I have never used the object tag so can't really instruct you on that
[03:25:03] <bahamas> ufk_: what's a query rewrite thing?
[03:25:17] <Jan\> raj what about iframe ?
[03:25:19] <ufk_> ok i'm opening an iframe that needs to rewrite the user to a different url
[03:25:26] <ufk_> and it works on any browser besides IE
[03:26:05] <mike029> hi everyone, is there a way to get the value of the page the browser just navigated *off* of (basically what the back button goes to)? i tried looking through the source but got overwhelmed
[03:29:16] <bahamas> mike029: document.referrer
[03:29:46] <thinkerweb> any mind looking at a website on their mobile device?  www.cable72.com
[03:30:48] <thinkerweb> It looks fine in mobile view mode on my desktop browser if I narrow the windows, but on my cell phone, it is messed up, and I am thinking I'd let it slide if it is like that only on my old Android version but fine on new versions, and blackberry and iphones.
[03:31:52] <mike029> bahamas, firebug is throwing "(an empty string)" at me
[03:33:19] <mike029> thinkerweb, it looks ok for my iphone 5, but it loads *insanely* slow
[03:33:43] <mike029> you have too many images, go back and replace them with css3
[03:33:45] <bahamas> mike029: how did you test it?
[03:34:01] <mike029> i had on pageshow show console.log(document.referrer);
[03:34:05] <mike029> bahamas^
[03:34:16] <thinkerweb> hmm, its an old design, like 1 year old, I bought from chocotemplates
[03:35:10] <bahamas> mike029: btw, do you need this to allow the user to use the back button when your page is doing dynamic stuff?
[03:35:36] <mike029> i would go back and start replacing the images, for example that top black box can be done with two images sprited together and stacked on top, using css3 to place them. for example the dots can be repeated all over, and the bottom can be repeat-x positioned bottom
[03:35:40] <thinkerweb> mike029, thx for testing for me
[03:37:50] <mike029> bahamas, i want the same page to basically change a link depending on where it is coming from. it's a data page, and if it comes from the list then it can be a back link. but if i comes from the home page, i want it to "back" to the list page. my plan was to check if the history page was the list, then that could be data-rel back, and if it were the home page, then link it to the list
[03:38:14] <mike029> do you follow?
[03:39:08] <mike029> thinkerweb, no problem, you really have to switch most of it to css3 though if you want any kind of performance....it's slow on my iphone 5....imagine what it's like on a crappy android phone
[03:39:52] <thinkerweb> mike029, yeah, but it is not in the budget, might as well redesign the whole thing in bootstrap then
[03:40:01] <bahamas> mike029: sounds like the most reliable way is to pass the referrer from the backend
[03:40:50] <bahamas> mike029: or, since it's a back link, don't you have categories or something?
[03:41:07] <thinkerweb> mike029, can you test cuecontent.ca too, and let me know the load speed too?
[03:41:10] <bahamas> mike029: so, since you know in which page you are, you can get the parent
[03:42:08] <mike029> bahamas, yeah i could just make a global variable for it and be done with it, i just figured there was a variable *somewhere* that the back button functionality obviously uses to go back, was hoping i could just use that
[03:43:01] <mike029> thinkerweb, faster, but still the images are bogging it down
[03:43:05] <bahamas> mike029: google doesn't say anything about it. apparently there's window.history.back, but you can't access that value
[03:43:26] <bahamas> it's actually window.history.back(), so it's a function
[03:44:09] <mike029> like for example you have those horizontal lines that are taking forever load. just make a div with a top bottom border and box-shadow it. it looks almost the same and loads immediately
[03:44:30] <mike029> or stick box-shadow on an <hr>
[03:45:05] <thinkerweb> mike029, the slider works? my android shows the slider empty for cuecontent.ca and the slider has a surprising top margin and overlaps the row below for the cable72 slider.  I bought both from chocotemplates.  I should've bought from wrapbootstrap instead
[03:45:09] <mike029> using rgba() for the color and lower the opacity
[03:45:37] <mike029> the slider is weird
[03:45:53] <mike029> it works but it sticks at about 50% through then slowly moves it in...
[03:49:20] <bahamas> speaking of sliders, does anyone have any idea why when I start dragging a slider it jumps to the right on chromium?
[03:49:59] <bahamas> also clicking on the slider path to the right of the slider doesn't move the slider to that position
[03:50:43] <thinkerweb> mike029, both sliders or just cable72?
[03:51:20] <thinkerweb> How can detect if it is old android and do something like marin-top: 0px;
[03:55:42] <mike029> thinkerweb, the cable one goes by itself once every second and ignores input
[03:55:52] <mike029> you should check where your css is messed up
[03:56:12] <mike029> to be honest i never use those templates....i usually just get the photoshop and just build it myself using as much css3 as possible
[03:56:13] <thinkerweb> mike029, yeah, those links are broken, you can't navigate the carousel
[03:56:24] <mike029> there are *always* issues with the code in the templates
[03:56:49] <thinkerweb> mike029, yeah, you are right, but it is a quick to make a site  look professional, otherwise you have to spend a month
[03:57:06] <mike029> im building an app ATM that is with the exception of 5 images completely css3 and fonts for icons
[03:57:15] <mike029> i made this app over the weekend....
[03:57:33] <mike029> i should be finished tonight. it is actually much much faster to just build it using css3
[03:57:42] <thinkerweb> mike that what I should've done, but these templates looked really nice
[03:58:10] <mike029> grab the color numbers from photoshop and draw it all. it loads immediately with no lag or anything
[03:58:19] <mike029> i agree, i buy them too :-)
[03:58:43] <mike029> i just recreate it in code from their photoshop design, plus it's cheaper anyway hahaha
[03:59:17] <mike029> and jQm does most of the legwork for you
[04:00:06] <thinkerweb> mike029, but I would still have to use that background image.  I think I am gonna just leave, I am betting it works on Iphone, and only Androids are troubling it
[04:00:38] <raj> Jan\, haven't worked with iframes yet either
[04:00:39] <raj> sorry
[04:00:39] <thinkerweb> If my customer hires me for more work and expands on the site, then I will rebuild it
[04:01:01] <mike029> thinkerweb, then at least set the background color of that div to something similar
[04:01:10] <mike029> so it doesnt look like white blank garbage before it loads
[04:02:34] <thinkerweb> mike029, really, I thought the background color was black
[04:02:51] <thinkerweb> the images are white
[04:03:09] <motaka2> I have a very major problem - in this page http://fa.noondreams.com/routes/render/5 I have a javascript file called Tricker.js , on localhost I get both the alerts alert("inside") and alert("outside")   but on live I just get alert("outside") - Why is that ?
[04:03:10] <thinkerweb> just very low opacity
[04:03:24] <thinkerweb> the slider starts going really fast too
[04:05:26] <motaka2> thinkerweb: Can you help me?
[04:06:37] <rob_> hi, can anyone tell me why this doesn't replace all instances of foo on my page with bar? http://pastie.org/7680435
[04:07:03] <motaka2> I have a very major problem - in this page http://fa.noondreams.com/routes/render/5 I have a javascript file called Ticker.js , on localhost I get both the alerts alert("inside") and alert("outside") but on live I just get alert("outside") - Why is that ?
[04:08:58] <thinkerweb> mike I think you swipe through the slider though
[04:14:35] <motaka2> I have a very major problem - in this page http://fa.noondreams.com/routes/render/5 I have a javascript file called Ticker.js , on localhost I get both the alerts alert("inside") and alert("outside") but on live I just get alert("outside") - Why is that ?

[04:35:32] <crazydiamond> Hi. How do I get value of radio input? Say, I have a lot of radion inputs with the same name. $('[name=myradio]').val()
[04:36:53] <_daemon_> crazydiamond: $('input[name=radioName]:checked')
[04:39:17] <crazydiamond> _daemon_: thanks
[04:43:33] <crazydiamond> _daemon_: and is there sth easier than e.g.  $('input[name=radioName]').filter(function(){return this.value===v;}).attr('checked', 'checked'); to select one?
[04:47:07] <_daemon_> crazydiamond: i dont think so. you either use filter or each
[04:47:14] <abhas> how to import and export .xls files in js without activex?
[04:48:03] <crazydiamond> _daemon_: ok. thanks
[04:54:13] <thinkerweb> the javascript is failing on my android
[04:56:34] <okdamn> hey how do i make this run only for 1 time? http://pastebin.com/9VGwNJTh

[05:15:14] <DukeDrake> okdamn: change if($(this).val().length >= 10 ){    to    if($(this).val().length == 11 ){
[05:15:27] <okdamn> right thanks
[05:44:08] <lenswipee> hi, jquery is giving me some grief.
[05:44:25] <lenswipee>  jQuery('span.alerts').removeClass('alerts').addClass('title').html('new text');
[05:44:59] <lenswipee> problem: the 'new text' is NOT ALWAYS added. usually fails after a few tries.
[05:45:59] <_daemon_> are you calling it in document.ready?
[05:46:16] <_daemon_> or before dom is fully loaded?
[05:47:30] <lenswipee> when document is ready. It works for like 2-3 times but fails after that.
[05:47:48] <lenswipee> addClass works without fail
[05:48:09] <lenswipee> .html() <-- not so reliable?
[05:50:47] <lenswipee> is there an alternative to .html()
[05:51:57] <_daemon_> there is javascript alternative. search for innerHTML
[06:40:41] <warden23> Hello, using jQuery how do I 'replace' a DIV's CSS?
[06:41:00] <diverdude> warden23, switch the class of the div
[06:41:03] <warden23> So I strip the DIV's CSS and add new.. or none..
[06:41:28] <diverdude> any recommendations for a good jquery validation plugin?
[06:41:52] <warden23> Cool, how do I do this? :P
[06:42:18] <diverdude> warden23, .toggle()
[06:42:29] <warden23> thanks
[06:42:36] <diverdude> .addClass()
[06:42:40] <diverdude> .removeClass()
[06:42:53] <diverdude> just google it man
[06:43:54] <warden23> :) thx
[06:51:19] <deweydb> hi.
[06:51:36] <deweydb> i am sort of stuck on something with $.when...
[06:52:05] <deweydb> i have a .each() loop that runs a bunch of ajax $.post()
[06:52:25] <deweydb> i want to trigger a callback when all the post's have received their responses.
[06:52:31] <deweydb> i assume this is possible with $.when
[06:52:39] <deweydb> but i just can't figure out the correct syntax.
[06:57:11] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I just scoured the web for a way to affix something to the bottom (like position:fixed but that also works for mobiles...)... Now, there's lots of stuff that uses position:absolute on resize/scroll. However, I need to affix a div which is of variable height. I.e.: it's one div which's "bottom" always needs to stick to the bottom of the screen. Sometimes, a few divs *within* it expand...
[06:57:12] <JD-Robbs> ...and retract. That's where my problem is. so I'd highly appreciate any pointers to tutorials/plugins. Thanks! :-)
[06:57:16] <b-ot> JD-Robbs: highlyappreciateanypointerstotutorialsplugins.th - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[06:57:31] <motaka2> I have a very serious question - in this page http://fa.noondreams.com/routes/render/5 I have a javascript file called Ticker.js , on localhost I get both the alerts alert("inside") and alert("outside") but on live I just get alert("outside") - Why is that ?
[07:19:58] <warden23> Could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/9advg/
[07:20:41] <warden23> I'm trying to make it so if the page has #green-success-message then the .message's class is changed to .messagesuccess
[07:21:38] <warden23> Please someone :D?
[07:23:15] <_daemon_> warden23: you can do smth like that: $('.message').addClass('messagesuccess');
[07:25:50] <warden23> _daemon_ that doesn't seem to work? http://jsfiddle.net/9advg/1/
[07:26:05] <warden23> .message colours still show
[07:26:34] <warden23> .message should be removed and .messagesuccess added to the parent div
[07:26:44] <warden23> Which should change that orange to a red
[07:26:57] <SuperTyp> Hello, I wanted to validate a from using jquery and validate()
[07:27:19] <SuperTyp> I have implemented jquery but firebug says that "validate() is not a function"
[07:27:54] <devinceartas> did you write a validate() function?
[07:28:30] <SuperTyp> no
[07:28:35] <SuperTyp> isnt it implemented?
[07:28:41] <devinceartas> no
[07:28:53] <SuperTyp> I use this plugin
[07:28:54] <SuperTyp> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[07:29:02] <devinceartas> jQuery would have no idea how to validate your particular page
[07:29:18] <SuperTyp> devinceartas: with the plugin too?
[07:29:26] <devinceartas> no idea, haven't used that.
[07:29:36] <SuperTyp> anyone used it?
[07:29:36] <_daemon_> warden23: http://jsfiddle.net/K3zsp/
[07:29:42] <devinceartas> perhaps there are examples in ther eyou can follow?
[07:29:57] <SuperTyp> there are, and I followed them
[07:30:43] <_daemon_> warden23: do you want something like this?
[07:31:30] <warden23> Thanks _daemon, yes but I would also like to replace that .message
[07:31:37] <warden23> to messagesuccess
[07:31:47] <warden23> I tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/K3zsp/1/
[07:31:59] <warden23> But obviously that won't work because the first one removes .message lol
[07:32:30] <SuperTyp> I will take a closer look to the demo...maybe I
[07:32:38] <SuperTyp> find the solution there
[07:32:53] <_daemon_> warden23: you have to do this like this http://jsfiddle.net/Bjj25/
[07:33:11] <diverdude> ,how do i select all elements that has a data-validation attribute?
[07:33:26] <warden23> yay, legend! thanks _daemon_
[07:33:27] <warden23> :)
[07:33:40] <_daemon_> warden23: no problem :)
[07:34:28] <SuperTyp> ok this is very strange, the demo & test files return the same error that $(...).validate() is not a function oO
[07:39:50] <SuperTyp> can some1 tell me how to hide the status messages from irc?
[07:40:54] <SuperTyp> got it
[07:47:28] <SuperTyp> I found the error
[08:01:46] <Jon__> hello
[08:04:33] <warden23> How do I make this a dual call? if($('.message').length > 0){
[08:04:48] <warden23> I want to make it so it's .message or .messagesuccess
[08:05:55] <JD-Robbs> I don't quite understand b-ot. I have a specific issue with divs of variable heights and keeping these affixed. I scoured the web and could not find anything for this particular scenario. So I kindly asked if anyone knows of something top-of-mind. Did that go against this channel's codex or someting? ;-)
[08:06:48] <JD-Robbs> asdf so blah TEST

I've followed the instructions on the page, but not a whole lot is happening. is there some kind of init() that i have to run?
[08:09:27] <snufft> by "not a whole lot is happening" i mean nothing is happening when i click the link to slide my panel out.
[08:09:32] <snufft> should clarify that :p

[08:21:47] <sekyms> how do I get the data attribute out of this
[08:23:51] <sekyms> the .square not the #layout
[08:25:17] <sekyms> I've also tried e.target.attr('data-foo')
[08:27:56] <sekyms> HAH
[08:27:58] <sekyms> got it

[08:59:56] <jimi_> I have an object which has a function like foo.getResults() ... which returns the results of an ajax call.     It always returns 'undefined' even though, if I put an alert inside the ajax callback, i get a value back. I think the function is returning before the callback is complete. How should I approach this?
[09:06:30] <diverdude> ,Why does this fail? jQuery.parseJSON("{'foo':'bar'}")   i need to do jQuery.parseJSON('{"foo":"bar"}') it seems...however thats a problem to use. is there a way to do  jQuery.parseJSON("{'foo':'bar'}") ?
[09:08:42] <baubbelayponge> hello, how do you select multiple elements stocked in vars in jquery? In mootools I can do $$(var1, var2)   but not in jquery apparently
[09:10:21] <diverdude> baubbelayponge, stocked?
[09:11:00] <baubbelayponge> diverdude, well, let's say var1 contains a div and var2 contains another one, I just want to do the same thing to them
[09:12:44] <baubbelayponge> diverdude, for your json problem, use single quotes for the json string and double quotes for the keys and values
[09:12:47] <diverdude> baubbelayponge, why not just selecting the divs?
[09:13:03] <baubbelayponge> because I already have them in memory, I don't want to use the selector again
[09:13:06] <diverdude> baubbelayponge, yeah i know....but thats the thing i want to avoid?
[09:13:10] <baubbelayponge> you can't
[09:13:29] <diverdude> baubbelayponge, hmm problem is that i need to store the json string in a html attribute
[09:14:32] <baubbelayponge> can't you use the data() method instead?
[09:17:38] <diverdude> baubbelayponge, yeah thats what im trying
[09:17:56] <diverdude> baubbelayponge, but i do it "compiletime" not runtime
[09:22:57] <baubbelayponge> then why don't you use single quotes for the html attribute?
[09:25:06] <ML74> Having some trouble using .append(). It seems to be adding the html content twice..
[09:26:24] <shoky> baubbelayponge: $([var1, var2]) if they're dom elements,  or var1.add(var2)  if jq objects
[09:26:53] <shoky> $(var1).add(var2) would work in either case
[09:27:34] <baubbelayponge> thanks shoky will try!
[09:33:09] <k1ng> why does /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test($('#username').val()) always return true even it has @&#@$^#$*@ on it?
[09:33:53] <shoky> jimi_: you should do your stuff inside the callback, not outside of it. indeed, by the time the callback is called, the outer function has already returned. you just cannot "return" results of an ajax call
[09:34:49] <shoky> ?js /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test('hi@@')
[09:34:52] <bot-t> shoky: false
[09:35:40] <shoky> k1ng ^
[09:47:49] <diverdude> , why is the element not found? http://jsfiddle.net/AUETf/1/
[09:51:03] <diverdude>  anyone?
[09:52:05] <touchscreen> because
[09:52:07] <shoky> diverdude: .data() doesn't write to the element's attributes, it only reads from them, once
[09:52:17] <touchscreen> it doesn't have the attribute data-error
[09:52:42] <thinkerweb> For some reason, javascript isn't loading on my Android phone.  My page looks great in mobile view on the desktop computer, but on my Android device, the nav bar breaks, and the javascript carousel is breaks. www.cuecontent.ca & www.cable74.com I have no idea how to fix it.
[09:53:00] <thinkerweb> I heard it works fine on Iphone
[09:54:58] <darkmutt> $("#left-menu > li").hover(function(){
[09:54:59] <darkmutt> 	if(false == $(this).next().is(':visible')) {
[09:54:59] <darkmutt> 		$('#left-menu > ul').slideUp(300);
[09:54:59] <darkmutt> 	}
[09:54:59] <darkmutt> 	$(this).next().slideToggle(300);
[09:54:59] <darkmutt> });
[09:55:15] <thinkerweb> oops you flooded
[09:55:26] <darkmutt> :/ sorry wanted to paste jsfiddle link
[09:55:35] <touchscreen> i don't think .data reads attributes
[09:55:49] <diverdude> shoky, hmmm so i can never insert anything in data() ? Why can i then do data('','') in jquery?
[09:55:57] <touchscreen> not jquery's .data() function
[09:56:21] <darkmutt> http://jsfiddle.net/rkGMA/1/
[09:56:40] <touchscreen> diverdude you can set data using data(), however, it's not stored as an attribute to the element
[09:56:41] <darkmutt> how to make this work so that on hover ontop of menu its folded out and not folded in ??
[09:56:54] <touchscreen> the data you set using .data() has to be retreived using .data()
[09:59:16] <diverdude> touchscreen, ok, where is it then set?
[09:59:57] <shoky> diverdude: internally in jquery
[10:00:56] <shoky> attributes can only store strings.. while with .data() you can store any js data (objects, ints, functions, etc)
[10:02:36] <diverdude> shoky, but still....i dont understand why i cannot store that error attribute then?
[10:02:50] <diverdude> i mean if its stored internally thats just fine
[10:02:54] <shoky> you can, but you'd have to use .attr() for that
[10:03:01] <diverdude> but what im trying to do should still  be possible
[10:03:25] <shoky> you can use .filter() too
[10:03:53] <touchscreen> i stand corrected, .data() does read HTML5 data-* attributes
[10:04:00] <diverdude> shoky, but why not .data()?
[10:04:21] <touchscreen> diverdude, you should use .attr() to set attributes
[10:04:45] <shoky> diverdude: .data() doesn't write to the attribute...
[10:04:57] <magn0z_> hi! i've managed to assign a "change"-handler to my <select>. is it possible to programmatically trigger the change function? i would just call it manually, but i've used an anonymous function as my handler, so i have no function name for it..
[10:05:08] <shoky> diverdude: this is what i mean with .filter()  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/AUETf/5/   it's still using .data()
[10:05:11] <touchscreen> any data you set using .data() has to be retreived using .data()
[10:05:18] <diverdude> ahhhhhhh
[10:05:22] <diverdude> okay i understand now
[10:05:52] <diverdude> and can i do .data() on a set of elements?
[10:06:00] <shoky> for writing, yes
[10:06:01] <touchscreen> yes
[10:06:59] <diverdude> and not for reading?
[10:07:10] <sunbeam> Is there a way to gray out one date in datepicker, based on an if statement, say if today is the first date of the month, gray out that date
[10:07:17] <sunbeam> Anyone knows?
[10:08:07] <shoky> diverdude: just like you can't use .val() or .attr()  for reading from multiple elements
[10:09:09] <shoky> but using .each() or .filter()  you can loop them and read from each, like in my fiddle
[10:09:48] <shoky> or even .map() if you want an array of datas
[10:10:54] <darkmutt> hm how would i make each ul in an id collapsible even if it's nested in 1 or more already collapsible ul's??
[10:12:29] <touchscreen> set call .hide(), or set display: hidden
[10:14:59] <shoky> sunbeam: yeah you can do that with this option http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShowDay
[10:16:07] <shoky> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ztYAG/7/
[10:22:12] <shoky> magn0z_: you can programatically trigger it, but why do that when you can just name your anonymous function and call it directly.
[10:23:39] <compex> anyone know how to make bootstrap tabs work with masonry?
[10:24:51] <thinkerweb> i have a carousel plugin, how do I make so you can navigate to each slide, it has these circles that light up for the active slide, but they aren't clickable, where would I start to make em clickable.
[10:25:24] <shoky> .on('click'..  ?
[10:28:07] <thinkerweb> cable74.com/js/functions.js
[10:30:37] <last1> I'm using the fileupload plugin with jQuery and I'm trying to submit multiple elements in the formData
[10:31:00] <last1> In here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options  they say to submit like this
[10:31:05] <chinoto> last1: I just use an iframe for that personally
[10:31:30] <last1> obj.formData=[{field1:'value'},{field2:'value'}]
[10:31:37] <last1> but that posts 'undefined'
[10:31:50] <last1> just obj.formData={field1:'value'} works though
[10:32:13] <last1> so how can I submit more than one value ?
[10:32:17] <chinoto> perhaps one of your fields is invalid, try using console.log on you inputs
[10:32:50] <chinoto> last1: oh urdoinitwrong
[10:32:56] <chinoto> last1: I think
[10:33:19] <chinoto> last1: you want {field1:'value1',field2:'value2'}
[10:34:28] <last1> damn...that worked
[10:34:33] <last1> so did I just read that page wrong ?
[10:35:06] <last1> they give this as example: [    {        name: 'a',        value: 1    },    {        name: 'b',        value: 2    }]
[10:36:16] <chinoto> last1: I didn't even read the page :D
[10:36:28] <last1> well, thank you :)
[10:36:48] <chinoto> you said that "obj.formData={field1:'value'}" works which is what made me suggest that
[10:37:13] <last1> but wouldn't [] delimit an array ?
[10:37:19] <last1> why is it {} in this case ?
[10:37:33] <chinoto> {} is an object
[10:37:53] <chinoto> in php they are the same thing, but in javascript they have specific meanings
[10:38:22] <chinoto> an array is a sequential list of values starting from 0
[10:38:49] <last1> but the way I read that page is that this is basically a sequential list of objects no ?
[10:38:50] <chinoto> an object can have any pair of (string)key and value
[10:38:51] <g44> im having problems with sortables within sortables (sortception?) and jquery-ui... i cant get dynamically created divs to become sortable?
[10:39:08] <last1> obj.Formdata=[{obj1},{obj2}]
[10:39:14] <chinoto> g44: use jsbin.com to show code
[10:39:21] <chinoto> or whatever you prefer
[10:39:26] <last1> isn't that proper way to have an array of objects ?
[10:39:47] <chinoto> last it is proper, but apparently not what you want
[10:39:55] <chinoto> last1: I'll take a look at the plugin's doc
[10:40:23] <last1> it's here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options#formdata
[10:41:07] <chinoto> ah, I see
[10:41:36] <g44> chinoto: www.laserpanda.com/laserowl2/editor.html
[10:41:53] <chinoto> it MUST be of the form [{name:'name1',value:'value1'},{name:'name2',value:'value2'}]
[10:42:42] <last1> so their doc is wrong ?
[10:43:33] <chinoto> last1: no, you misinterpreted it
[10:43:43] <g44> chinoto create a new "flerp-flerp". then drag the new element into the old one. no problem. take it out again. drag the old element into the new one.. doesnt work
[10:44:20] <g44> (atm you can only grab and drag just to the left of the "X" on the right hand side)
[10:44:50] <chinoto> g44: ...: The requested URL /laserowl2/editor.html/ was not found on this server.
[10:45:09] <g44> huh why you got a slash at the end?
[10:45:28] <chinoto> odd
[10:45:37] <chinoto> ok looking
[10:53:48] <chinoto> oh btw, peeling potatoes -_-"
[10:54:01] <g44> potato, omnom
[10:54:12] <g44> you see the problem, chinoto ?
[11:01:09] <mstrcnvs> what happens when I use 'on' with a selector that doesn't exists on the page, is the code loaded? or it just skips?
[11:05:56] <sunbeam> shoky: thanks!!
[11:06:05] <sunbeam> sorry wassaway
[11:06:13] <jimi_> shoky, Well, I was trying to write an object that could be called and used by other "classes"
[11:06:24] <chinoto> g44: you'll want to ask again, I haven't used nested sortables before :/
[11:06:38] <g44> k
[11:06:40] <sunbeam> I don't know this syntax, return [date.getDate() > 1, ""];
[11:06:42] <sunbeam> what does this do ?
[11:06:45] <g44> il try the forum
[11:06:51] <edoop> anybody use   elance for cowork ?
[11:06:54] <edoop> freelancer?
[11:07:06] <edoop> i starting my subscription
[11:07:09] <edoop> yester.
[11:08:06] <shoky> sunbeam: that returns an array with 2 items.  the first is a boolean, the second is a string
[11:09:01] <sunbeam> getDate() > 1 ?
[11:09:15] <shoky> date is the argument to that function
[11:09:30] <shoky> did you look at the api link i gave you
[11:09:39] <shoky> it says to return such an array
[11:09:53] <sunbeam> i tried testing it
[11:09:59] <shoky> read the docs first
[11:10:01] <sunbeam> beforeShowDay: function(date) { alert("test"); }
[11:10:05] <sunbeam> and doing this doesn do anyting
[11:10:07] <sunbeam> ok
[11:10:13] <shoky> it doesnt do anything?
[11:10:23] <sunbeam> no alert :(
[11:10:47] <shoky> when you show the datepicker, there should be some alerts..
[11:11:03] <sunbeam> nothing happens, the datepicker works
[11:11:10] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ztYAG/8/
[11:11:12] <shoky> there's alerts.
[11:11:23] <shoky> anyway don't debug things with alerts. you've heard this a hundred times
[11:12:50] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/m6PAaGhM
[11:12:52] <sunbeam> this is what i do
[11:14:10] <shoky> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ztYAG/9/  and it alerts
[11:14:37] <sunbeam> ohhhhhhh
[11:14:38] <sunbeam> wait
[11:14:42] <sunbeam> sorry man i know what i forgot
[11:14:47] <sunbeam> i use bootstrap datepicker
[11:14:51] <shoky> :\
[11:15:02] <sunbeam> not the jquery one
[11:15:11] <sunbeam> this one is basically jquery dp but customized
[11:15:24] <shoky> good luck with that
[11:17:03] <sunbeam> thanks
[11:17:43] <sunbeam> shoky: btw, how come people use this one
[11:17:44] <sunbeam> any idea?
[11:17:46] <sunbeam> http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
[11:18:03] <shoky> huh?
[11:18:07] <shoky> because they like it?
[11:18:33] <sunbeam> i don't know, it must have a lot disadvantages
[11:18:48] <shoky> which might not matter to some
[11:19:00] <shoky> so they are not disadvantages to them
[11:20:09] <sunbeam> hehe nvm in latest version they added this
[11:21:13] <sunbeam> shoky: so i should first check if today is the first date of the month
[11:21:21] <sunbeam> and then disable this day from being selectable, right?
[11:22:03] <shoky> i dont know bootstrap or this datepicker..
[11:22:18] <shoky> but .. why don't you read the docs.......
[11:22:24] <shoky> and do what they say
[11:22:53] <shoky> look at the bottom of that page
[11:22:58] <shoky> they have an example
[11:25:20] <sunbeam> its the same almost now
[11:25:21] <sunbeam> which page?
[11:27:50] <shoky> sunbeam:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ztYAG/10/
[11:30:46] <sunbeam> oh great this onrender function isnt added yet
[11:30:54] <sunbeam> can this also be done with beforeShowDay?
[11:31:19] <shoky> i showed you how to do it with that too...
[11:31:32] <shoky> get a grip man
[11:36:50] <sunbeam> ok
[11:36:51] <sunbeam> but
[11:36:58] <victorzu> kann mir jemand helfen
[11:37:01] <sunbeam> date() doesn't give 1
[11:37:03] <sunbeam> but gives the full date
[11:37:03] <victorzu> mit jquery
[11:37:33] <sunbeam> shoky: sorry what i mean is
[11:37:44] <sunbeam> shoky: i only want to disable the first day of the current month
[11:39:14] <shoky> sunbeam: figure it out man. let me know if you dont get it in a few hours..
[11:40:14] <shoky> `g mdn date
[11:40:14] <b-ot> shoky: Date - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[11:40:25] <sunbeam> so i just need to compare the month
[11:41:54] <LucasK> HI all. I have up to 15 <div>'s that have a few images, click events, and text within them. But they are more or less uniform aside from the data within (picture a pretty table). If every time I want to replace the contents of the table with new elements, would it be faster to edit the existing ones (text, images) or nuke it and draw them again?
[11:42:12] <jotik> Hi! If I use jquery 2.0, how can I test whether its supported by the browser or not?
[11:42:50] <LucasK> jotik: ie 6, 7, 8 are no longer suported by 2
[11:43:03] <LucasK> jotik: that is the only major change from 1.x in terms of support
[11:43:10] <jotik> LucasK: I know. How do I check that?
[11:43:53] <jotik> LucasK: I want to execute my code only if jquery 2.0 is supported on the client.
[11:43:57] <LucasK> jotik: What, you think they are lying to you? I don't kow what you mean. Open up an older IE browser and run some 2.x code and see if you encounter errors, you porbably will
[11:44:40] <jotik> LucasK: I want to: if (jquery.supportedByBrowser()) { executeCode(); }
[11:44:45] <shoky> jotik: you can use conditional comments though it's not recommended.. example here http://blog.jquery.com/2013/03/01/jquery-2-0-beta-2-released/
[11:45:22] <LucasK> jotik: sorry misunderstood, shoky's got it.
[11:45:23] <tw2113> jotik, use IE conditionals to load the jquery
[11:45:26] <jotik> shoky: sry, thats not what I'm looking for.
[11:45:35] <LucasK> jotik: yes it is, based on your desc
[11:46:03] <LucasK> jotik: unless you are saying you want to  use js to check (why?) then just do a browser check
[11:46:19] <tw2113> use modernizr to test for some feature you know IE8 and down won't support, and load 1.x after that
[11:47:00] <jotik> LucasK: is jquery supported by all other not-win98/ME-old browsers?
[11:47:17] <tw2113> IE8 is XP too :P
[11:48:30] <tw2113> yes, all major browsers have jQuery support in 2.0
[11:48:46] <tw2113> minus IE6-8
[11:48:54] <LucasK> jotik: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=jquery%20browser&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjquery.com%2Fbrowser-support%2F&ei=0zN0UbrdF7KN0wXl8ICYDQ&usg=AFQjCNELIyzxoGTgIMmrpSWKvM_pAcx8Og&bvm=bv.45512109,d.d2k
[11:48:59] <LucasK> err http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:49:47] <jotik> LucasK: thanks.
[11:49:57] <diverdude>  Hi, I made this: http://jsfiddle.net/MtyRF/1/ for validating fields. It has a problem. The tmp variable is overwritten which means only the last input field is shown. How can i do this in a proper way? :)
[11:50:03] <sunbeam> shoky: date_now = new Date(); if (date.getDate() === 21 && date_now.getMonth() == date.getMonth()) { return 'disabled'; }
[11:50:07] <sunbeam> is this ok?
[11:50:08] <sunbeam> it works
[11:50:19] <tw2113> looks like a basic if statement sunbeam
[11:50:23] <shoky> sunbeam: perfect
[11:50:25] <tw2113> and you said it works
[11:50:59] <sunbeam> hmm no sorry it doesnt
[11:51:04] <sunbeam> it still greys out all 21's
[11:53:27] <sunbeam> any idea how come?
[11:54:18] <sunbeam> tw2113: do you know
[11:54:26] <shoky> sunbeam: it works fine for me. if something doesnt work for you, make a jsfiddle so we can see what you did. why is that so hard? why do you need to be pushed to make a fiddle each time? its so annoying
[11:54:34] <sunbeam> if (date.getDate() == 1 && (date_now.getMonth() == date.getMonth())) { }
[11:54:37] <sunbeam> this should work right?
[11:54:39] <tw2113> know what?
[11:54:45] <shoky> sunbeam: JSFIDDLE.
[11:54:47] <sunbeam> if (date.getDate() == 1 && (date_now.getMonth() == date.getMonth())) {
[11:54:51] <tw2113> *shrug* i haven't done much with js dates
[11:54:52] <sunbeam> i dont get how this cannot work
[11:54:55] <sunbeam> ok shoky
[11:55:28] <banzounet> Hey guys, I've some problem using the $.ajax function I don't know why it's not working on windows xp(tested on multiple browsers) but it works well on windows 7
[11:55:54] <banzounet> Any lead?
[11:56:37] <shoky> banzounet you'll have to give more info
[11:56:43] <banzounet> shoky like?
[11:57:04] <shoky> like what "not working" means
[11:57:23] <shoky> and what your code looks like
[11:58:06] <shoky> and are you hosting it on a web server
[11:58:35] <sunbeam> shoky: tw2113 http://jsfiddle.net/NqBFD/2/
[11:58:53] <shoky> tw2113 please dont help him
[11:59:07] <shoky> figure it out sunbeam
[11:59:18] <sunbeam> hmm ok
[11:59:21] <shoky> cant be spoonfed for such simple stuff all day long
[11:59:24] <shoky> it's bad for you
[11:59:58] <shoky> now you're using jquery ui again?
[12:00:02] <shoky> make up your mind..
[12:00:31] <shoky> if you're using jquery ui, you need to follow jquery ui's docs
[12:00:40] <shoky> not bootstrap's. jeez
[12:00:44] <banzounet> shoky: Yes the script is on a web server, this is one of my ajax function http://pastebin.com/jr10f8aW and by not working I mean it suppose to return something but it doesn't. In the network tab of the chorme's console I've a line (Canceled) Pending for my request I guess
[12:01:05] <sunbeam> shoky: but technically there is (for this matter) no difference
[12:01:17] <shoky> sunbeam: there is technically much difference
[12:03:32] <sunbeam> regarding beforeShowDay?
[12:03:54] <shoky> sunbeam: jquery ui has beforeShowDay, that bootsttrap datepicker doesn't
[12:04:50] <sunbeam> It does, see https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/pull/305
[12:04:50] <b-ot> sunbeam: Pull request #305 by gabriel (3mon 1w ago): beforeShowDay option
[12:04:55] <sunbeam> This is the one I use
[12:05:30] <shoky> sunbeam: that's not the one you showed earlier.
[12:06:19] <shoky> sunbeam: and thats not what you're using in your fiddle. each one has a differnt function. stop assuming that they're the same
[12:06:24] <shoky> and RTFM
[12:07:15] <sunbeam> but this one I am using

[12:09:24] <diverdude>  Hi, I made this: http://jsfiddle.net/MtyRF/2/ for validating fields. Its almost working but has a problem. The tmp variable is overwritten which means only the last input field can be removed in the keyup handler. How can i do this in a proper way? :) (To test it press validate and the enter a value in input field 1 -  (msg 3 now disappears - it should be msg 1). Now enter value in input 2, no error message disappears now. nr2 should have di

[12:10:02] <shoky> and which fiddle that i gave you are you using as an example?
[12:12:12] <diverdude> anyone? :)
[12:12:50] <sunbeam> http://jsfiddle.net/RHDV5/8/
[12:13:17] <shoky> :o
[12:14:00] <sunbeam> shoky: i just don't know how I can set var MyDates one array value to the first date of the current month
[12:15:03] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/NqBFD/7/
[12:16:22] <sunbeam> shoky: that greys out the first day of the month
[12:16:28] <sunbeam> while its not the first currently
[12:16:45] <shoky> whatever.
[12:16:54] <shoky> go away already :\
[12:17:12] <sunbeam> whats the difference with the fiddle I made an yours?
[12:18:08] <shoky> one has your code, the other has mine
[12:27:53] <sunbeam> ok this did it
[12:27:57] <sunbeam> if (date.getDate() == 1 && (date.getDate() == date_now.getDate()) && (date_now.getMonth() == date.getMonth())) { }
[12:46:41] <shoky> diverdude: you need to use 'var' for your vars, otherwise you're setting global vars
[12:49:31] <shoky> also nice, had no idea .data() parses json for you
[13:17:21] <otters> how do you add functions to jquery objects?

[13:22:37] <simowewe> Hello, if i have a question, should i just post it here in main?
[13:26:38] <tw2113> just ask
[13:39:45] <simowewe> Okay, i've got a menu that on .click() should fadeOut() current box, and fadeIn() requested box. ( http://pastebin.com/WzpA69jG ) However, it seems like if i press to menu buttons two boxes gets .fadeIn() because it starts running the newest request before the first one was finished fading?
[13:39:55] <simowewe> How can I avoid that to happend?
[13:39:58] <simowewe> happen*
[13:40:24] <simowewe> press two*
[13:41:59] <jost> simowewe: it probably helps to stop any previous animations on the elements. Before doing the new fading, select all elements that are potentially fading at the moment, and call stop() on them.
[13:42:52] <jost> and then bring them to the state they should be in (hidden, or whatever it is)
[13:43:31] <simowewe> alright, thanks. I also tried using the css selector id|=board which should target all elements with attr id that starts with board, but it didnt seem to work. Arent all css selectors available?

[14:19:14] <diverdude> im using this plugin: http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/    How can i check i a input-field has a datepicker attached?
[14:19:39] <okdamn> check classes with firebug diverdude
[14:19:53] <okdamn> then if(element.hasClass())
[14:20:00] <diverdude> okdamn, no i need to do it programatically
[14:20:52] <pachet> check classes with jquery diverdude
[14:21:22] <diverdude> pachet, but it has no special class attached
[14:21:25] <okdamn> datepicker_element.on('', if has class)
[14:21:44] <okdamn> you can use listner on click, change, try some of them :)
[14:21:58] <okdamn> check if datepicker is visible so
[14:22:18] <okdamn> if ($(_element).is(':visible'))
[14:28:05] <okdamn> http://jsfiddle.net/DrCdw/7/
[14:28:20] <okdamn> why i can't trigger keydown ? :P

[15:43:56] <eugenmayer> according to http://api.jquery.com/val/

[17:07:45] <b-lew> Can I score some help. I have a if statement that looks for a description but when I put in an image its stating img=null. I think its because I'm pulling from a data-img attribute is it possible in the if statement to state if in .description look for the src not data-img?

[17:23:13] <dotDeeka> anybody have experience working with custom events on javascript objects? I want to trigger an event on an object and then see if the return value of the callback was true or false. Similar to how you can return false from a callback and stop propagation.
[17:23:17] <dotDeeka> Something like http://jsfiddle.net/dotDeeka/xAj2v/
[17:23:32] <nastus> becuase thats what im using to change tabs currently and it works
[17:23:39] <b-lew> http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2 -> if you click the first image you see the img=null in the console.
[17:24:02] <nastus> but if I hit a new tab and refresh i just want to bring them back to it :/
[17:24:14] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/Cuun6/1/ what isn't working?

[17:28:19] <RyanD_> Interesting ?. I only want a given JS function to execute while at the root directory (JS file is included on every page). IE, execute at http://www.mydomain.com, but not at http://www.mydomain.com/mypath
[17:28:38] <RyanD_> Thoughts?
[17:29:50] <dotDeeka> RyanD_: check for document.location.pathname ?
[17:30:21] <dotDeeka> not sure how cross browser that is
[17:32:41] <dotDeeka> I want to trigger a custom event on a JS object and see what the return value of the callback bound was
[17:32:59] <dotDeeka> a basic example would be  http://jsfiddle.net/dotDeeka/xAj2v/
[17:39:54] <windsurf_> what do you think is the cleanest way to have one combobox update which fields are present in the rest of the form? So far I've got jQuery and mustache.. thinking of having like 3 different forms as mustache templates, so combo box triggers form drawing of the three templates
[17:40:23] <Third3ye> Anybody know of a way to make an element scroll vertically? I've tried CSS using position:fixed; but I don't want it to scroll horizontally
[17:40:50] <windsurf_> Third3ye: i think you just modify the 'top' property
[17:40:58] <windsurf_> oh that'd be javascript though, not css
[17:41:11] <Third3ye> Yeah, I'm.. asking in #jquery :P
[17:41:11] <windsurf_> though you'd use js to modify the css 'top'
[17:41:29] <windsurf_> $('#el').css('top', -20)
[17:41:32] <windsurf_> for ex.
[17:41:52] <windsurf_> in a loop or as a result of user interaction, mouse wheel, whatever
[17:46:03] <Jan\> you guys know a script that grabs addresses from the page and displays a google map ?
[17:46:14] <Jan\> for each of them if many
[17:54:24] <windsurf_> Jan\: no, maybe search for a chrome plugin then inspect its source?
[17:54:46] <windsurf_> Jan\: i have one that turns phone numbers into Skype links so maybe one exists for addresses/maps.
[17:58:32] <Jan\> you guys know a script for toppage linking ?
[17:59:17] <tw2113> windsurf_, IE does that automatically
[18:01:11] <windsurf_> tw2113: does what sorry?
[18:01:54] <tw2113> turns #s into skype links
[18:02:03] <windsurf_> tw2113: interesting.
[18:02:16] <tw2113> not the term i used, but potayto tomahto
[18:02:20] <tw2113> :D
[18:02:29] <tw2113> at least if the user has skype installed
[18:02:32] <tw2113> i should probably clarify

[19:54:39] <b0ss_> coldhead: it looks ok, thanks. gonna test it out tomorrow. I guess it stays and stays public right ?
[19:55:44] <coldhead> yes
[19:56:01] <coldhead> guzzlefry: not easily
[19:56:19] <coldhead> same origin policy applies and a bunch of other iframe security horrors
[19:58:54] <guzzlefry> ah
[19:59:07] <guzzlefry> maybe it's just the code throwing firebug for a loop then
[19:59:57] <coldhead> n0wk: http://jsfiddle.net/UXZpD/1/
[20:00:07] <coldhead> untesteded because you didn't give us any html
[20:00:15] <coldhead> but it works great in my imagination
[20:01:31] <n0wk> thank you coldhead

[20:16:45] <Pago> hello i've got a problem and i am a javascript noob. got some code here i did. i want that it makes 1 out of these 12 visible onclick. http://jsfiddle.net/rH2nR/
[20:18:26] <guzzlefry> Pago: can you apply a class to all of them?
[20:19:07] <Pago> i did for positioning cause they all are lieing on the same place
[20:19:19] <empire> you lie
[20:19:58] <Pago> nope^^ the positining is in the css..
[20:21:03] <guzzlefry> Pago: what's the class common to them?
[20:21:34] <coldhead> anyway i can't believe rebecca expects me to hang out with her fucking dog for 18 hours
[20:21:41] <coldhead> oops, wrong window
[20:21:50] <empire> rebecca is a skank
[20:21:56] <empire> fuk that noise bro
[20:21:58] <coldhead> how dare you
[20:22:03] <coldhead> she's the best woman i know
[20:22:03] <guzzlefry> out of line!
[20:22:35] <guzzlefry> is it a hyper dog?
[20:22:51] <coldhead> nothing a little kahlua can't fix
[20:22:55] <Pago> to the lyrics? .lyrics (but again in the class i only got their position. every lyric has a own id because they all got different input
[20:22:55] <coldhead> or a lot of kahlua
[20:23:16] <Pago> * i mean text
[20:24:56] <guzzlefry> Pago: so when they are clicked, you want to show only the one clicked?
[20:25:07] * guzzlefry is confused
[20:26:58] <Pago> i want that: if the id song is clicked, a specific lyric gets visible. the lyrics are all behind each other and hidden.
[20:28:00] <Pago> the rest stays hidden
[20:28:14] <guzzlefry> so, are the lyrics and song IDs related? song with ID of 1 has a related #lyrics1?
[20:30:00] <Pago> they are not realted in the code. i just want if song1 is clicked lyric1 should appear. song1 is just text and acts like a button
[20:31:06] <guzzlefry> can you paste your code?
[20:32:06] <Pago> the whole? i did the javascript up there
[20:32:32] <guzzlefry> the HTML
[20:32:52] <Pago> its pretty big.. but ok
[20:34:00] <guzzlefry> hard to manipulate the elements of an HTML document if you don't know what they are :)
[20:35:13] <Pago> i know what they are
[20:35:15] <Pago> http://jsfiddle.net/rH2nR/
[20:36:09] <guzzlefry> oh
[20:37:21] <guzzlefry> Pago: that's the same thing
[20:37:22] <Pago> i just want the code to manipulate the css visibilty onclick
[20:38:06] <guzzlefry> Why the second function at the end?
[20:38:30] <Pago> http://jsfiddle.net/rH2nR/1/
[20:38:49] <Pago> i dont know my self
[20:39:05] <Pago> thought its says if its not clicked it stays hidden
[20:44:09] <guzzlefry> yeah, give each song a class="song"
[20:44:58] <HenriqueMachado> give each a no song a class="no-song"
[20:45:46] <guzzlefry> wat
[20:45:56] <Pago> ok
[20:46:50] <Pago> well that doesnt help me much, but thx
[20:48:08] <guzzlefry> well, I was working on it :P
