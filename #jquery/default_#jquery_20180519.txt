[04:13:55] <senaps> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/h7DWbt5ZTW/ i want this code to stop the intervals if a redirect has been clicked. but it doesn't work and interval just continues to run. where have i got wrong?
[04:50:41] <crazyhorse> if i use $('h2:nth-of-type(1).nextUntil('h2')
[04:50:50] <crazyhorse> is there a way i can get all the html from the result of that?
[04:51:01] <crazyhorse> or do i have to iterate through and append them to a string?
[08:43:49] <ranum> hi - I'm having trouble with this button. If I put it in the bottom left corner of the image then resize my browser, the button ends up off of the image. - https://jsbin.com/zarovacevu/edit?html,output
[08:44:02] <ranum> can anybody help?
[09:14:18] <KnightsOfNi> Anyone knows what this means? var console = window.console || { log: function () {} };
[10:04:05] <pavonia> KnightsOfNi: It assigns the standard console to the console variable in case it exists, otherwise a dummy object with a dummy log function is created
[10:04:21] <pavonia> KnightsOfNi: This is to make sure that a call of console.log() never fails
[10:05:09] <KnightsOfNi> but it won't actually log anything then ?
[10:05:13] <KnightsOfNi> if it doesn't exist
[10:05:47] <KnightsOfNi> When would window.console not exist?
[10:06:50] <pavonia> Right, `function () {}' just does nothing
[10:12:03] <ranum> I can't figure out why resizing my browser horizontally results in the button moving vertically. any ideas?
[10:31:25] <pavonia> ranum: It doesn't move horizontally for me, just stays at the same place
[10:33:21] <ranum> the button moves vertically
[10:33:32] <ranum> from what I can tell
[10:34:20] <pavonia> Not for me, only the image changes in size which makes it look like the button is moving
[10:35:26] <ranum> how can I make the button stay where it's dropped in the image, even when the browser resizes?
[10:37:48] <pavonia> Perhaps giving it a postion relative to the image's bottom would work
[10:38:32] <pavonia> You could also recalculate the position of the button but there probably is a pure CSS solution too
[10:41:44] <ranum> is CSS a better solution than the calculations?
[10:48:31] <thykka> ranum, do you have vertical margins expressed in %?
[10:48:51] <thykka> oh there was a test case.. looking now
[10:51:23] <pavonia> ranum: Something like this: https://jsbin.com/helasihige/edit?html,output
[10:51:43] <thykka> you're setting the button's top value in absolute units, but left value in relative units. Try using % for both
[10:52:16] <thykka> although.. this would work better if you contained the image and button within a common offset parent
[10:54:16] <ranum> yes, like that except also being able to place the button on demand
[11:01:02] <ranum> thykka: I've tried that but it didn't seem to work
[11:35:53] <IhrFussel> Can I upgrade from 2.2.4 to 3.3.1 without much hassle?
[11:38:20] <ranum> thykka: https://jsbin.com/qosesagaki/edit?html,output
[11:39:00] <ranum> the problem is the button is dropped at differing distances
[11:45:46] <jak2000> hi all
[11:55:49] <pavonia> ranum: Why do you set the position in relation to the window height? Shouldn't it only depend on the image height?
[11:56:37] <ranum> yes
[12:05:29] <ranum> how do I convert it to a percentage without the window height though?
[12:22:44] <pavonia> ranum: You could use .offset() to get the coordinates of the image and use that to calculate the mouse position within the image area
[12:28:06] <shoky> KnightsOfNi: window.console didn't exist in old IE if the console wasn't open. so doing console.log() would error
[12:28:40] <shoky> (but you couldn't see the error cause the console wasn't open :D )
[13:03:30] <pavonia> ranum: It's e.pageY - offset.top to get the y position
[13:15:34] <ranum> pavonia: is it var ofst = e.offset(); ?
[13:16:12] <pavonia> No, $("#change-image").offset()
[13:25:13] <ranum> and then convert it to a percentage?
[13:26:29] <pavonia> Right
[13:32:52] <ranum> pavonia: https://jsbin.com/dibapociwu/edit?html,output
[13:35:27] <pavonia> You need the container around the image and the button, otherwise the position is relative to the whole page
[13:41:38] <ranum> I would like to be able to use this code with images on other pages too. Is there another way than using a container for each image?
[13:46:08] <pavonia> I can't think of any other than setting a window resize handler and updating the button's position accordingly
[13:49:32] <ranum> using the click function code in a resize event?
[13:58:32] <pavonia> Yes, but I'd really recommend against it. Let CSS do as much of the layout as possible
[14:16:00] <ranum> why so?
[15:41:06] <spaces> why do people dislike jQuery so much and don't look at the future 4.0 ?
[15:46:35] <jak2000> spaces hi
[15:46:56] <jak2000> i have  <input type='file' how to check if user choosed a file?
[16:20:33] <pdub> Question...
[16:20:54] <pdub> How do I create a google map, on the .done() of a .get(getsDataFrom_myAPI)?
[16:21:29] <pdub> oh snap i think I just found an example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23456849/how-to-load-the-google-maps-api-via-a-userscript-synchronously
[16:21:38] <pdub> possibly... window.onload is the trigger there, versus .done
