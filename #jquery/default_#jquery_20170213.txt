[00:53:01] <dRealm> hello
[00:53:12] <dRealm> I want to verify a suspected error from Method 4 of http://pankajparashar.com/posts/modify-pseudo-elements-css/
[00:53:29] <dRealm> the person wrote:
[00:53:29] <dRealm>  var str = window.getComputedStyle($('.red'), '::before').getPropertyValue('content');
[00:53:29] <dRealm>  getComputedStyle() expects an Element as its first argument.
[00:53:39] <dRealm> Could it be that the person mixed jQuery code with vanilla JS ( I am referring to $('.red') ) by accident?
[01:59:12] <Cork> dRealm: yes, you can't pass jquery objects to getComputedStyle
[01:59:19] <Cork> it needs to be $('.red
[01:59:21] <Cork> opps
[01:59:26] <Cork> it needs to be $('.red')[0]

[06:34:06] <codecutter> can someone help me out with this? http://pastebin.com/YN6Hr4Ah

[06:47:19] <codecutter> brb ^
[07:06:42] <TheWild> hello
[07:07:06] <TheWild> how does .data() thing work that it can let even store objects and functions?
[07:18:14] <codecutter> $('foo').data('name',object);
[07:21:39] <TheWild> I know how to use it, but I'm curious how/where jQuery keeps the data.
[07:22:15] <TheWild> $('foo').data('name', function() {...})
[07:22:36] <TheWild> it cannot be element.dataset because it allows only strings.
[07:22:41] <TheWild> is that a WeakMap?
[07:25:04] <TheWild> jQuery site uses a version that doesn't use WeakMap (1.11.3), but still can keep objects as data.
[07:48:16] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/imMTw2QS
[07:48:17] <TheWild> DOM elements are just like normal objects and can store user properties (darn, why I didn't think of it in the first place?). However, I caught jQuery assigning a property like jQuery1113037468125696575105 with integer value. Why? Why diesn't it just create 'data' property and keep that stuff there?
[07:49:34] <codecutter> wrong jsfiddle:  https://jsfiddle.net/0t9rq1f7/
[08:08:57] <codecutter> 	i'm having trouble getting the bottom chart to appear (bar chart) like you see in the demo - http://pastebin.com/1WegN2PK
[08:10:32] <Cork> TheWild: that is the jquery expando value
[08:11:06] <Cork> TheWild: jquery uses that as a key for the data it can keep assosiated to a dom element through .data() (and som internal references)
[08:11:27] <Cork> TheWild: cause yes, you can add values to a dom element
[08:11:35] <Cork> TheWild: but it can only be strings
[08:11:59] <Cork> TheWild: also older ie browsers leaked those values so the reduced the amount as much as they could
[08:14:31] <TheWild> document.getElementById('container').data = {x: 10}; alert(document.getElementById('container').data.x); // definitely can keep objects
[08:14:41] <TheWild> ^ you mean that caused memory leaks in old IE?
[08:15:02] <Cork> i'm quite sure that at least wasn't valid
[08:15:20] <Cork> the dom spec says properties on a dom element are strings
[08:16:40] <Cork> interesting that has changed
[08:16:46] <Cork> wonder when
[08:17:19] <Cork> TheWild: anyway yes older ie leaked all references assosiated with a dom element
[08:17:38] <Cork> i think that was fixed in ie8 if i remember correctly
[08:17:43] <Cork> might have been ie7
[08:17:49] <Cork> (though i know it existed in ie6)
[08:18:15] <TheWild> IE was a nightmare most of the time.
[08:18:32] <TheWild> Cork: thank you very much for explanation
[08:18:37] <Cork> also creating random keys on dom elements is a bad idea as it risks colliding with future specs
[08:19:20] <Cork> the best example i've seen is a.download, that broke a few sites then that property landed a few years back
[08:19:44] <Cork> so it is normally better to avoid adding properties at all if you can
[08:20:27] <Cork> there is the dataList property you can use and add values in there, that is safe
[08:21:11] <TheWild> I'm curious of one more thing. Since jQuery generates expando value to use that as a key for the data it keeps internally, is the .data() object associated with an element a subject to garbage collection?
[08:21:33] <Cork> yes, and no
[08:21:54] <Cork> when you remove elements from the page through jquery it calls a method to clean up the data object in jquery
[08:22:08] <Cork> if you replace the elements outside jquery, then no they will be left
[08:24:08] <TheWild> fine. Thank you.
[08:55:08] <km4> array is not empty its correct? > if(!data.array.length){..} / if(!data['array'].length){..}
[09:08:46] <MikeD_> that reads weirdly to me
[09:20:14] <Robinst> Hi, i have a question about jquery ui widget. I've already looked in the docs, but can't seem to find the right answer. I've created a photobook widget. After including the js file, I first set a global var: var photobook = $('#pages').photobook();. But next I want to call something like photobook.someFunction(). Doesn't work. I have to do photobook.photobook('someFunction'), which looks really strange to me. Any advice?
[09:22:03] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:22:32] <jomofcw> Is it still useful to use the jQuery Form plugin (by Malsup), or is jquery core serialize() enough ?
[09:26:11] <Cork> Robinst: the call function in ui is to send the function name as a string to the widget on the element
[09:26:42] <Cork> Robinst: so $('#pages').photobook(); ('#pages').photobook('theFunction', 'arg1', 'arg2');
[09:27:09] <Cork> jomofcw: depends on what you want it to do
[09:27:24] <Cork> (never used to said plugin so don't know what it adds)
[09:30:49] <Robinst> Cork: ok, tnx. I'll just have to accept that I guess. Hoped there was a more elegant solution. :-)
[09:31:31] <Cork> Robinst: like what?
[09:31:49] <Cork> what you get from photobook is the normal jquery object
[09:31:54] <Robinst> photobook.someFunction('arg1', 'arg2');
[09:31:59] <Cork> if every wiget had there function in there it would be a mess
[09:32:12] <Cork> photobook.autocompleteSearch()
[09:32:32] <Robinst> true
[09:32:43] <Cork> (instead of .autocomplete('search'))
[09:33:04] <Cork> it also means the widget can filter what function you are allowed to call
[09:37:09] <nickan> Hi.. how to type this in raw javascript? ---> https://jsfiddle.net/g51pr8dL/2/
[09:38:47] <Cork> nickan: depends on if you can require classList support from the browser
[09:39:38] <nickan> Cork: I tried classList but I got it didnt support
[09:40:01] <Cork> nickan: btw the if case is broken
[09:40:12] <Cork> $('.has-sidebar').toggleClass('active'); will always run
[09:40:19] <Cork> on every click
[09:40:44] <Cork> $('.sidebar.active') returns an object and that is truety
[09:41:24] <nickan> yes, I got the class on my div when I click, but how to add a class to another div at same click ?
[09:41:25] <Cork> nickan: if you can't relay on classList you will have to modify the className string attribute
[09:41:48] <Cork> nickan: just select the element and add the class
[09:42:06] <Cork> though it becomes a bit messy if you don't have classList
[09:42:07] <nickan> how to do that in raw javascript?
[09:42:28] <Cork> var classes = elm.className.split(' ')
[09:42:40] <Cork> then you will have to loop that list and see if the class you want to add is there
[09:42:43] <Cork> and if not add it to the array
[09:42:54] <Cork> and afterwards elm.className = classes.join(' ')
[09:43:17] <Cork> classlist would just be elm.classList.add('active')
[09:46:42] <jomofcw> Cork hello ^^ ! I use jQuery Form plugin to submit my form through AJAX, nothing more.
[09:47:10] <Cork> jomofcw: ok?
[09:47:21] <Cork> you can do that quite simple with pure jquery
[09:47:41] <nickan> Cork something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/g51pr8dL/3/
[09:48:12] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post(this.action, $(this).serialize()).done(function(data) {}); })
[09:49:17] <Cork> nickan: addClass could just be this.className += " " + add;
[09:50:18] <Cork> nickan: also you just have to remove the class from the array
[09:50:26] <Cork> you don't have to concat them into a new string
[09:51:42] <Cork> nickan: https://jsfiddle.net/g51pr8dL/5/
[09:51:49] <Cork> opps typo
[09:51:58] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/g51pr8dL/6/
[09:52:28] <Cork> nickan: also i would prob avoid adding those methods to the prototype, those are very generic and will most likely risk colliding
[09:53:07] <nickan> Cork : is there a better solution of doing it=
[09:53:21] <Cork> create a separate object and take the elm as an argument
[09:53:40] <Cork> mygroup.hasClass(elm, className)
[09:53:42] <nickan> This is the jquery function ---> if ($('.sidebar.active')) {    $('.has-sidebar').toggleClass('active');   }
[09:53:49] <Cork> mygroup.addClass(elm, className)
[09:53:52] <Cork> and so on
[09:54:02] <Cork> nickan: ya the $ is jquery
[09:54:07] <Cork> and all the methods are on $
[09:54:11] <Cork> not HTMLElement
[09:54:32] <Cork> the HTMLElement is $('.sidebar')[0]
[09:55:04] <Cork> (this is why you do $(this) to access jquery methods)
[09:55:26] <nickan> how get the class .sidebar ... is it HTMLElement.sidebar ?
[09:55:42] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll('.sidebar')
[09:56:02] <Cork> won't work in ie < 8 though
[09:56:37] <nickan> ok,, hmm.. this was not easy :P
[09:56:58] <Cork> well compatibility was the reason jquery was created
[09:57:34] <Cork> ie < 8 uses document.all['']
[09:57:51] <nickan> Cork : well I use jquery , but this is angular2 project, and its risky to use jquery
[09:58:21] <Cork> nickan: but did you understand the comment about that if case?
[09:58:34] <Cork> if ($('.sidebar.active')) {    $('.has-sidebar').toggleClass('active');   }
[09:58:41] <Cork> can be written as $('.has-sidebar').toggleClass('active');
[09:58:49] <Cork> it will do EXACTLY the same thing
[09:59:24] <nickan> yes, I know that... I just put it in that way because of the case
[09:59:42] <Cork> nickan: but the case won't matter
[09:59:58] <Cork> cause $('.sidebar.active') will alway ALWAYS be true
[10:00:25] <Cork> heck if($()) {} will also always be true
[10:00:42] <nickan> yes, it will =)
[10:00:59] <Cork> if you want to test if the element exists you have to use if($('.sidebar.active').length > 0) {}
[10:02:25] <nickan> Cork this is no jquery in this project, otherwise it wouldnt be a problem =)
[10:02:34] <Cork> ...
[10:02:46] <Cork> your completely not getting the point are you...
[10:03:26] <Cork> <div class="sidebar"> if($('.sidebar.active') { alert('yes') } // alerts "yes"
[10:03:32] <Cork> <div class="sidebar active"> if($('.sidebar.active') { alert('yes') } // alerts "yes"
[10:03:33] <nickan> yes, I understand where you going =) You got right about that
[10:04:30] <nickan> thanx again,, need to go. bye ono
[10:20:10] <jomofcw> Cork thanks, that was the meaning of my question ! So, can you tell me an example where it's useful to work with jQuery Form, please ? Just to be sure to understand.
[10:20:30] <Cork> jomofcw: as i've never used it; no
[10:22:29] <jomofcw> Cork héhé OK ;). Anywya, now for "simple ajax submit" I'll use core jQuery function, that will be enough. Thanks for your help Cork !
[10:22:36] <jomofcw> *Anyway
[10:26:26] <cp_> how do i get to a prototype class from on('click')
[10:26:28] <cp_> ?
[10:26:52] <cp_> this is getting the event instead of the prototype class?
[10:38:35] <Cork> cp_: prototype class?
[10:38:43] <Cork> what exactly are you talking about?
[10:43:28] <cp_> got it
[10:43:29] <cp_> :D
[10:47:31] <exounx> greetings :D
[10:48:17] <exounx> I'm having an issue where a word wrap is collding with an element. Is there a way to detect a word wrap and then add class to element if so
[10:53:06] <qtech> Can anyone help me with why my sorting is not working? http://kopy.io/IVfl2
[10:59:32] <Cork> exounx: no, you can make sure the element has margins and is inline-block (and not position absolute) to avoid that though
[11:01:14] <Cork> qtech: uh, sort expects a -1, 0 or 1 value not a function
[11:01:38] <Cork> so the outer function(index) {} is what breaks things
[11:02:34] <qtech> okay Cork.  So I just need to remove the inner function and to the return by itself?
[11:03:34] <Cork> qtech: .sort(function(a,b) { if(a < b) { return -1; } else if(b > a) { return 1 } return 0; })
[11:03:38] <Cork> that is how the function works
[11:03:58] <Cork> a and b will be element in the array
[11:04:07] <Cork> and the function is meant to compare them
[11:04:18] <Cork> if the array is objects you can grab specific keys from it
[11:04:27] <Cork> *properties
[11:05:14] <Cork> qtech: ex .sort(function(a,b) { if(a.num < b.num) { return -1; } else if(b.num > a.num) { return 1 } return 0; })
[11:05:27] <Cork> and wow i suck...
[11:05:39] <Cork> qtech: ex .sort(function(a,b) { if(a.num < b.num) { return -1; } else if(a.num > b.num) { return 1 } return 0; })
[11:05:44] <Cork> heh >_<'
[11:07:51] <qtech> Cork.  Thanks for the help.
[11:11:43] <Arualz> hi ppl, how can i detect if inside next div has input? http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output i'm using if($(this).next('.test').find(':input')){
[11:14:22] <Cork> Arualz: you want nextll().first()
[11:14:48] <Cork> Arualz: .next() will look at the next element, and only return it if it matches (else nothing)
[11:16:16] <Arualz> Cork: can you see the jsbin? http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[11:16:18] <Arualz> :(
[11:22:13] <Arualz> Cork: dont work :(
[11:22:13] <verax5> How do I get the number? "(123)"???? pls help
[11:22:32] <Cork> Arualz: you will still have to use the selector
[11:22:42] <Cork> ńextAll was meant to replace .next()
[11:22:45] <Arualz> Cork: can you see the jsbin?
[11:22:48] <Arualz> ahh
[11:22:53] <Cork> verax5: regex
[11:25:00] <Arualz> Cork: http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output ?
[11:25:05] <Cork> verax5: "(123)".match(/\((\d+)\)/)[1] == "123"
[11:25:09] <Arualz> dont work :|
[11:26:23] <dglambert> yo
[11:26:24] <verax5> wow wtf
[11:27:00] <verax5> returns null..
[11:29:14] <verax5> console.log(jobsCount.match(/\((-?\d+)\)/)[1]);
[11:29:17] <verax5> I'm getting null
[11:29:36] <verax5> jobsCount = "(16,604)"
[11:30:08] <Arualz> dont work too :(
[11:34:26] <Cork> verax5: 123 != 16.604...
[11:34:44] <Cork> you will need to use [0-9,]+ for that
[11:34:45] <verax5> wells shit
[11:36:54] <Arualz> hi, how can i detect if has input into next div? http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[11:37:43] <verax5> wow
[11:37:47] <verax5> is there any ajax alternative..
[11:38:13] <Cork> verax5: ajax? what does this have to do with ajax?
[11:38:37] <verax5> Cork:  I'm making ajax request to a job site to return job counts
[11:38:52] <verax5> I'm run a loop with different job titles and get count for each
[11:40:44] <Cork> verax5: then you would have to run this in the .done callback
[11:40:59] <Cork> cause no, there isn't anything built into ajax
[11:47:21] <verax5> Cork:
[11:47:22] <verax5> thanks man
[11:47:29] <Arualz> hi, how can i detect if has input into next div? http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[11:47:29] <verax5> got it working with each loop
[11:47:37] <verax5> js/jquery is so dam  hard : (
[11:55:07] <verax5> Cork:
[11:55:24] <verax5> I have a variable in JS, it's an array. How would I go about getting it in php
[11:55:29] <verax5> I wanna pass it to my template
[12:04:41] <MikeD_> verax5: are you familiar with form post?
[12:05:04] <verax5> ye MikeD_
[12:05:11] <verax5> i do backend but find front very confusing
[12:27:03] <Arualz> how can i check if the next class is an input?
[12:29:26] <robertmaxrees> "next class"?
[12:41:26] <robertmaxrees> oh man no taplar
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[12:49:22] <verax5> My method is hit every second, new data is passed every time. How do I put all that data into an array?
[12:49:26] <verax5> just push it into one?
[12:49:44] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it.
[12:50:38] <verax5> Cu I? cant create a new array every time method is hit
[12:50:48] <verax5> then it resets the array..
[12:52:14] <Arualz> robertmaxrees: next class, after click this.
[12:52:23] <robertmaxrees> Arualz mind making a fiddle?
[12:52:41] <robertmaxrees> verax5 so you make one in a parent scope of the ajax call to hold that state for you.
[12:52:50] <Arualz> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[12:53:14] <Arualz> checking if into next <div has input
[12:54:46] <robertmaxrees> Arualz so .next() just grabs the next sibling element.
[12:55:07] <robertmaxrees> .verify is a child of text.
[12:55:18] <robertmaxrees> so you need to .closest('.test').next().find(':input')
[12:55:28] <verax5> robertmaxrees:  Ye I set an array variable outside ajax scope, I push data into that array but I cant access it outside ajax scope..
[12:55:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:55:50] <robertmaxrees> you alreayd said it's outside of the ajax scope.
[12:55:55] <robertmaxrees> do you mean that the data isn't updated?
[12:56:14] <verax5>     var results = new Array();
[12:56:25] <verax5> results = jobsCount.replace(/[{()}]/g, '');
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or something.
[12:56:39] <verax5> ^ that 2nd bit is inside ajax callback method
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> also - just do var results = [];
[12:56:52] <verax5> while results variable is outsidenormal global vriable
[12:59:41] <Arualz> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[12:59:52] <Arualz> all alert is ok
[13:00:29] <Arualz> duch_kazatel: all alert is ok, that is wrong =\
[13:01:27] <taplar> ta da!
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> Arualz what do you mean?
[13:02:07] <robertmaxrees> can you update the fiddle maybe?
[13:02:19] <Arualz> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output checking after click if has input item into next div. like "b" div click.
[13:02:54] <Arualz> updated fiddle: http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[13:03:32] <robertmaxrees> .find(':input').length
[13:03:34] <robertmaxrees> not === true
[13:03:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:04:23] <taplar> mmm, live edits
[13:05:00] <Arualz> robertmaxrees: display 1 only after click into "a" div, and 0 all other.
[13:05:04] <Arualz> kkkk =(
[13:11:32] <taplar> Arualz: what are you trying to do?
[13:16:48] <taplar> good chat
[13:36:50] <Alhauz> robertmaxrees: sorry, lost internet connection
[13:36:57] <robertmaxrees> all good.
[13:37:14] <Alhauz> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/sadagetegi/edit?html,js,output
[13:37:28] <Alhauz> its wrong :( display 1 only in the first div
[13:37:41] <robertmaxrees> isn't that what you want?
[13:38:07] <robertmaxrees> if it's not, can you clarify what you're expecting?
[13:38:16] <Alhauz> ok
[13:39:30] <Alhauz> i need check if in the next div have input text.
[13:39:58] <Alhauz> fire in the box B alert ok, because in the box C have input text
[13:40:17] <robertmaxrees> in your case in input is box b.
[13:40:35] <Alhauz> i'm using $(this).closest('.test').next().find(':input').length;
[13:40:40] <taplar> yeah, something weird with css is making it look like it is in box c
[13:40:40] <Alhauz> yep
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> i can see that.  the code is doing exactly what you want it to.
[13:41:22] <Alhauz> but when i click in the box A, diplay alert 1, box b, c or d alert 0
[13:41:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:41:34] <robertmaxrees> bnecause box b has the input.
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> you want to check if the next .test contains an input.
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> that's what your code is doinmg.
[13:42:06] <Alhauz> yep!
[13:42:09] <Alhauz> no
[13:42:13] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:42:17] <robertmaxrees> box b contains the input.
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> so when you click a, you'll get 1.
[13:42:35] <Alhauz> only in the box b, but box c display zero too
[13:42:44] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[13:42:48] <Alhauz> box d display zero too
[13:42:52] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:42:54] <robertmaxrees> thjat's what you wanted.
[13:43:00] <robertmaxrees> because box b contains the input./
[13:43:01] <Alhauz> no, wait plz
[13:43:01] <verax5> I'm making a request to a page. And in source this shows(js)   'siteSearchResultsCount': '136421', is there any way to get it's value?
[13:43:41] <taplar> Alhauz: there is only one input field, which is in box b.  So any logic for box b or afterwards would be 0.
[13:44:11] <Alhauz> taplar: nice, how can i search if only the next box have input?
[13:44:23] <robertmaxrees> that's what you're doing....
[13:44:26] <taplar> ^
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> you're already doing it.
[13:44:36] <taplar> 1 == next box has input
[13:44:45] <taplar> 0 == does not
[13:45:10] <taplar> i'm unsure what you are confused about
[13:45:17] <Alhauz> see, input is into box C
[13:45:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> it's in box b.
[13:45:26] <robertmaxrees> your css is messing it up.
[13:45:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/fizipinexu/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:45:39] <Alhauz> OMFG, hahahaha is in the box B
[13:45:41] <Alhauz> sorry
[13:45:43] <taplar> :|
[13:45:53] <Alhauz> LOL
[13:46:00] <robertmaxrees> we kept telling you that >.>
[13:46:00] <Alhauz> so crazy cc
[13:46:01] <Alhauz> css
[13:46:14] <taplar> i mean, it's in b in your markup and your logic isn't moving it so...
[13:46:15] <Alhauz> thank you and sorry!
[13:47:00] <Alhauz> nice! i'm crazy
[13:47:04] <robertmaxrees> verax5 mind elaborating a bit?
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> verax5 are you getting back that object?
[13:47:38] <verax5> robertmaxrees:
[13:47:38] <taplar> Alhauz: all good.  we all have our moments
[13:47:46] <Alhauz> kkk
[13:47:47] <verax5> https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/developer
[13:47:52] <verax5> I'm trying to get the listings count
[13:48:04] <robertmaxrees> verax5 what are you using?
[13:48:14] <verax5> robertmaxrees:  ive been jquery
[13:48:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're fetching the entire page?
[13:48:48] <verax5> robertmaxrees:  i dont want to but i have to ye
[13:48:58] <verax5> jobsCount = $(data).find('.count ')[0].innerHTML;
[13:49:22] <robertmaxrees> $('.page-h1-title .count');
[13:49:28] <robertmaxrees> use that selector instead.
[13:49:43] <robertmaxrees> $(data).find('.page-h1-title .count').text();
[13:55:46] <seaoftea> If I look at the console, it is logging the right element but when I focus on it, it selects the next element for some reason... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/89b3f2e94eaa35f41287cec8585036e3
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> seaoftea console.log($('.nav-menu > .menu-item').find('a').length);
[13:56:35] <verax5> thanks robertmaxrees :D
[13:56:43] <robertmaxrees> how many do you get?
[13:57:32] <seaoftea> robertmaxrees: Farts.... I just figured it out. I am using a keydown event and I forgot to preventDefault()
[13:57:40] <robertmaxrees> seaoftea heh.  there you go!
[13:57:56] <seaoftea> Thx!
[14:07:35] <verax5> im looping through ajax using each method
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:07:43] <verax5> but results return at different order
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[14:07:57] <verax5> each request asks for different data
[14:07:58] <verax5> one sec
[14:08:41] <verax5> robertmaxrees:
[14:08:42] <verax5> http://kopy.io/4FBwH#MNlaXZAdBTNuX5
[14:09:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah - so things will happen out of order as ajax calls finish.
[14:09:13] <robertmaxrees> they're async - that's part of their nature.
[14:09:16] <verax5> ye i know..
[14:09:20] <verax5> dafuk do i do yo?
[14:09:28] <robertmaxrees> why does the order matter?
[14:09:39] <verax5> because of job title
[14:09:50] <verax5> each job title has certain jobs count returned
[14:10:11] <robertmaxrees> so you wanna make sure the current title gets the right count?
[14:10:18] <verax5> ye robertmaxrees
[14:10:35] <verax5> but counts are returned in random order...
[14:10:38] <verax5> so it messses it up
[14:10:38] <robertmaxrees> then you need to map them back to one another.
[14:11:02] <robertmaxrees> results.push({jobTitle: title, count: jobsCount.replace(/[{()}]/g, '')});
[14:11:08] <robertmaxrees> then render stuff out.
[14:18:45] <iaj> Hi there.. I got a form with several fieldset's inside of it... Only one should be shown, so all the other should be set to display: none,  However, how can I find out which one is currently being shown with jQuery??
[14:18:55] <robertmaxrees> iaj .filter()
[14:19:03] <robertmaxrees> you can use that to check for a class.
[14:37:17] <robertmaxrees> taplar see the news?
[14:40:27] <taplar> nope
[14:43:08] <taplar> dam related?
[14:43:22] <taplar> woah!
[14:46:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:47:31] <robertmaxrees> about 40 minutes from me.
[14:51:57] <user12343454> Hi there I am trying to get this to work an cant any ideas? https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lgxtmx/
[14:52:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lgxtmx/1/
[14:52:38] <robertmaxrees> user12343454 just needed to include jquery
[14:52:46] <user12343454> ahhhh]= cheers man!
[14:52:52] <user12343454> thanks!
[14:53:51] <robertmaxrees> also, you already have true or false.
[14:53:56] <robertmaxrees> no need to compare
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/c7Lgxtmx/2/
[14:54:25] <user12343454> thanks
[14:54:29] <user12343454> only works on load
[14:54:43] <user12343454> so not sure how useful it would be anyway
[14:54:54] <user12343454> but cheers all same!
[14:54:57] <robertmaxrees> why are you using js for this?
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you can check the window resize.
[14:55:18] <user12343454> well was thinking about loading php elements on mobile resize
[14:55:30] <user12343454> with load()
[14:55:35] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't worry about doing that
[14:55:45] <user12343454> no?
[14:55:54] <robertmaxrees> if the user on on desktop, they're not really gonna size the window down like that very often.
[14:56:03] <user12343454> true
[14:56:27] <user12343454> perhaps i could do load on click after the media queries
[14:56:39] <user12343454> add button in after the resize
[14:56:49] <user12343454> cheers!
[14:56:51] <robertmaxrees> how different are the two pages?
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you could just use css to show/hide stuff instead.
[14:57:08] <user12343454> think ill do that!
[14:57:11] <user12343454> Good call
[15:01:31] <qakhan> hi all, i have a form and i am using jquery validate to validate the form inputs.
[15:01:48] <qakhan> here is my code. http://jsfiddle.net/c5R3b/59/
[15:02:21] <qakhan> i have 4 input fields and 1 file field.
[15:03:18] <qakhan> user can enter single information by filling up the first 4 fields. or upload the .csv file for milple records.
[15:04:06] <qakhan> i want to check it user uploaded the file for multi record then dont validate the first 4 field.
[15:04:15] <qakhan> and vise virsa
[15:16:29] <verax5> how do i convert this into integer?
[15:16:31] <verax5> 1, 500
[15:16:49] <verax5> I need to pass this value to google charts but charts isn't accepting it
[15:18:57] <taplar> 1500 you mean?
[15:19:46] <verax5> i mean i wanna remove the space
[15:19:50] <verax5> ye
[15:20:24] <taplar> you can use the replace() method with a regex to replace them
[15:21:21] <qakhan> taplar can you please look at my question
[15:28:56] <taplar> qakhan: oh, so if they have selected a csv file you don't want to validate the other fields?
[15:29:07] <qakhan> yes
[15:29:32] <taplar> if you select the input field for the file it should have a file or files property on it that you can check a length on to see if they have selected a file
[15:29:44] <taplar> and then you can use that in your other validations to conditionally not validate
[15:31:09] <qakhan> taplar can you please share an example
[15:34:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0cfkv9hu/
[15:39:42] <qakhan> taplar i am look for with validate
[15:39:51] <qakhan> jquery validate
[15:40:04] <taplar> ah, well that would be a custom validation thing.  you'd have to dig into the validate docs to see some examples
[15:41:20] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27037106/jquery-validate-plugin-conditional-required-field#27037151
[15:47:46] <qakhan> thanks taplar

[18:58:04] <dglambert> yo
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> sup
[18:58:39] <dglambert> not much, just doing alittle night coding
[19:10:01] <rehat> does anyone know if ajaxSuccess would always get called for any cross domain javascript requests?
[19:10:56] <robertmaxrees> rehat not for any.
[19:10:59] <robertmaxrees> but for some
[19:12:00] <robertmaxrees> well, sorta.  what's the problem you're having?
[19:12:44] <rehat> we are trying to inject a js into a ios web view to see when an ajax call is complete but it only works on some pages not sure why
[19:12:59] <robertmaxrees> what kind of ajax call is it?
[19:12:59] <rehat> could be that some of the pages are not sending this data though jquery?
[19:13:08] <rehat> robertmaxrees: not sure
[19:13:44] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing data calls outside of jquery's ajax?
[19:14:25] <robertmaxrees> i get the feeling you're using global ajax event handlers, is that accurate?
[19:14:35] <rehat> well that is what I am thinking.  That some of the pages are using something else to do a POST request
[19:14:43] <rehat> yeah
[19:14:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not gonna catch calls not made with jquery.\
[19:15:03] <rehat> well is this global "$( document ).ajaxSuccess ..."
[19:15:47] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[19:15:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:15:54] <robertmaxrees> those won't work with non-jquery requests./
[19:19:56] <rehat> robertmaxrees: thanks
[19:20:09] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[20:10:28] <Darmani> Is there an easy way to create a range between two time objects?
[20:13:04] <robertmaxrees> Darmani not "easy".
[20:13:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest moment.js.
[20:13:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'd convert both date objects using .getTime(), subtract one from the other, then do math.
[20:13:48] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5075336/how-to-perform-date-subtraction-in-javascript
[20:13:48] <Darmani> lame.
[20:15:09] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: moment.js doesn't look like it can handle ranges...
[20:15:22] <robertmaxrees> sure it can.
[20:15:32] <robertmaxrees> what kidn of format do you want?
[20:15:46] <Darmani> oh found it
[20:15:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:16:01] <Darmani> thank god. I didn't want to roll that out myself
[20:16:19] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: you're awesome man, thank you.
[20:16:27] <robertmaxrees> hey thanks!
[20:19:00] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I have this calendar widget and an Event object that has a start_date, end_date. The problem is if there's an event that's over a few days or a week I need to block out all the calendar days in that range.
[20:19:37] <robertmaxrees> moment can help you do that last i checked.
[20:19:53] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: yeah I know. just wanted to give you some context :p
