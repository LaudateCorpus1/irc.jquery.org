[02:29:32] <undefined_bob> how can I check if a click on my page is inside or outside of my menu?
[02:33:41] <Cork> undefined_bob: $(document).click(function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('#menu').length > 0) {} })
[02:34:12] <undefined_bob> thanks Cork, I'll try that
[03:27:59] <__marco> Hello. I would, and I think I must, include a reference to jQuery licence in my code. How to do that?
[03:28:44] <Cork> __marco: you don't you need to keep the copyright header in the jquery file though
[03:29:08] <Cork> but that shouldn't be something you need to do anything to do so
[03:29:25] <__marco> I plan to have a LICENCE file with my licence and following the jQuery licence. Should I specify which files are copyrighted from jQuery
[03:29:42] <__marco> ?
[03:30:39] <Cork> it is normally specified as a header in each file
[03:30:55] <Cork> but ya, you should prob ask a lawyer about that
[03:31:44] <__marco> I was hoping to have an answer here :D
[03:31:55] <Cork> you're not very likely to get one
[04:57:26] <Pymous> Hello !
[04:58:17] <Pymous> I have a small question about setTimeout, if I start a timer to execute an hour later, but my user leave the browser on his mobile (not closing the tab) and come back 2 hours late r
[04:58:39] <Pymous> Where does the timer picks up ? Will it execute the function in the timeout, or start counting where it left ?
[04:59:34] <Cork> Pymous: that is a quite browser dependent answer
[05:00:02] <Cork> Pymous: the currently common answer is that browser reduce granularity when the tab goes into the background
[05:00:55] <Cork> meaning time resolution is decreased so ex. a timeout that would trigger every 100ms if the tab was in focus gets fired every 500 or 800 ms
[05:01:09] <Pymous> Since it's a specific use case, I will probably be better off coding something based on the actual time, no ?
[05:01:38] <Cork> if you want it to fire only when the page is in focus use requestAnimationFrame
[05:01:54] <Cork> you can't really animate based on time
[05:02:37] <Pymous> I don't wan't to animate, I wan't to refresh the page if the page is open more than 1 hour
[05:03:37] <Pymous> So if I open the page at 3PM, do some stuff and "leave" (answer a phone call, ...) and come back at 5PM, the page get reloaded
[05:04:13] <Cork> then you want setTimeout(function() { requestAnimationFrame(update); }, 3600000);
[05:04:30] <Cork> Pymous: sure but how would you trigger that?
[05:04:44] <Cork> setInterval(checkDate, 1)?
[05:04:52] <Pymous> Maybe
[05:05:05] <Cork> use the setTimeout solution i gave you
[05:05:08] <Cork> it would do what you want
[05:05:11] <Pymous> Thanks :)
[05:05:33] <Cork> it would set a timer for 1 hour and then after that wait for the page to get focus
[05:05:40] <Cork> as soon as it gets focus it would trigger
[05:06:15] <Cork> if you want to trigger no matter if it gets focus just don't use the requestAnimationFrame
[05:06:46] <Cork> (if you plan to restart the timer i would recommend using the requestAnimationFrame for that though)
[05:06:58] <Pymous> Thanks for your advices :)
[07:41:39] <Ice_Strike2> Is this right way doing the selector varible
[07:41:49] <Ice_Strike2> $('.' + type + '-extra-row', orderDetailsModal)
[07:41:53] <Ice_Strike2> '.' + type + ' feel messy
[07:42:07] <Cork> it is, but ya it is the way
[07:42:31] <Cork> you can do ['.', type, '-extra-row'].join('') if you prefer
[07:42:34] <Cork> but it isn't much better
[07:43:25] <Ice_Strike2> I prefer my option
[07:45:23] <Cork> don't blame you, just gave the two options there is
[07:51:18] <Ice_Strike2> $('.info-row', orderDetailsModal).filter(function (index, item) { return $(item).data('parent-id') == orderItemId }).remove();
[07:51:33] <Ice_Strike2> This work fine
[07:52:03] <Ice_Strike2> but rather than doing filter, is there a way to find .info-row and data-parent-id=xxx' to delete?
[07:52:05] <Cork> ya, i normally prefer to go similar routes too
[07:52:10] <Cork> though it is more costly
[07:52:59] <Cork> Ice_Strike2: depends on if it is an attribute or a jquery data reference
[07:53:11] <Cork> (if you set it with .data, then no)
[07:54:52] <Ice_Strike2> $('data-id="' + orderItemId + '"'); maybe
[07:54:57] <Ice_Strike2> Or maybe that is bad :P
[07:55:12] <Cork> it works, if you don't use .data() to SET the value
[07:55:26] <Ice_Strike2> I didnt
[07:55:37] <Ice_Strike2> data= was created via php
[07:55:39] <Cork> you need [] around the attribute though
[07:56:04] <Ice_Strike2> why [] ?
[07:56:18] <Cork> cause else it isn't an attribute selector so it won't select anything
[07:56:26] <Ice_Strike2> oh
[07:56:28] <Cork> $('[data-id="' + orderItemId + '"]');
[07:57:51] <Ice_Strike2> [] mean find the value in the attribute?
[07:58:09] <Cork> yes if you provide one
[07:58:26] <Ice_Strike2> Got it.
[07:58:27] <Cork> attribute selectors are [attribute] or [attribute="value"]
[07:58:56] <Ice_Strike2> Make sense now.
[07:58:56] <Cork> (this isn't jquery but just css)
[09:23:37] <undefined_bob> Cork: I thought about the code you suggest in the morning. and I tried but it didnt work at all. maybe I'm wrong but does  if (!$(event.target) mean that I have to check every other elements on the page if the click was there?
[09:23:52] <undefined_bob> and not checking if the click was inside the menu?
[09:24:13] <undefined_bob> I mean I would have to check a lot of other elements
[09:24:24] <Cork> undefined_bob: you get the if and else with the same check
[09:24:42] <undefined_bob> (document).on('click', function(event) {   if (!$(event.target).closest('#menucontainer').length) { } });
[09:24:45] <Cork> the point is you need to grab it at the page level to do what you ask for
[09:26:49] <undefined_bob> I do have to replace #menucontainer with my own class, right?
[09:27:05] <Cork> it should match the outer most element of the menu
[09:27:51] <undefined_bob> its like this: <div id="sqrmaincontainer">   <div class="container">    <nav class="site-nav" id="nav" role="navigation">
[09:28:07] <undefined_bob> I tried with #site-nav
[09:31:14] <Cork> undefined_bob: https://jsfiddle.net/6ko4a7ec/
[09:33:09] <undefined_bob> Cork: thank you very much for that. I'll try again
[09:42:42] <undefined_bob> I tried with '#site-nav' and '#container' but I always get the "clicked outside menu" alert
[09:42:56] <undefined_bob> you can take a look here: https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/GMPOQY
[09:43:08] <undefined_bob> if you have time
[09:43:54] <Koopz> sayyyy... can i define a default function to execute when any of my $.post() calls trigger .fail()?
[09:46:45] <Koopz> $(document).ajaxError(function(){}) huh?... i kind of remember this
[09:49:49] <Cork> Koopz: have a look at $.ajaxSetup
[12:10:49] <poboy> I'm kickin' somebody's ass
[12:11:29] <taplar> cool
[12:12:21] <poboy> we have all this jquery working on this form, but when the user goes to add a second person that section has the same id as the first so everything blows up
[12:13:17] <taplar> sounds like a problem
[12:15:09] <poboy> I don't have time for this!  ah well, I'm hourly
[12:42:15] <MACscr> if my js loads in the <head>, how can i manipulate html that is dynamically created in the <body>? is the simplest solution just for me to have another js file that loads in the footer?
[12:42:51] <taplar> put it in a document ready
[12:42:59] <MACscr> hmm, it already is
[12:43:03] <taplar> so you're fine
[12:43:47] <MACscr> yet it doesnt work when my code is in the static js file in the header, but works fine if i run it on inline js in the footer of the page
[12:44:47] <taplar> dunno, doc ready is intended to delay the script from running until the markup is parsed into the dom.
[12:47:21] <MACscr> taplar yes, but if you have another jquery file within the body that is doing the same, then i would think it would load second
[12:47:41] <MACscr> basically im trying to manipulate a dataTables table
[12:48:00] <taplar> doc readies will stack, so yeah, you could have an ordering issue potentially
[12:48:03] <MACscr> that is dyamically generated and all of its js load is loaded in the body of this app
[12:48:39] <MACscr> so i need to figure out how to get my code to run after that without physically having to do that if possible
[12:48:53] <taplar> so if you can put it in the footer, and it works, that's one solution
[12:49:10] <taplar> another possible solution would be to make your header script not execute automatically and instead have the other scripts trigger them when they are done
[13:50:13] <ChiLL_SurF> hi there. i am using the code below, and I want to know how I can set a parent node in order to replace child later on  http://dpaste.com/1AGED7B
[13:50:52] <taplar> ##javascript
[13:51:05] <ChiLL_SurF> ok
[13:51:06] <ChiLL_SurF> thx
[14:03:12] <Ice_Strike2> Any idea why this wont work https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38504/
[14:03:19] <Ice_Strike2> to update the tooltip by finding the span
[14:10:42] <taplar> try using filter instead of find on the a and b
[14:45:16] <Levin^> hi there
[14:45:23] <Levin^> I created this code here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oGmNMo
[14:45:54] <Levin^> but I needed the text over the map to turn back to black when the map gets bright once again
[14:45:57] <Levin^> is there a way?
[14:46:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:46:17] <robertmaxrees> "when the map gets bright again"?
[14:46:24] <Levin^> oh
[14:46:41] <Levin^> well, if you use the scroll wheel over the map, the map gets darker
[14:49:40] <robertmaxrees> do the docs note any events for that?
[14:51:04] <Levin^> I only found the mousewheel event, not the change in opacity of the element with the class gm-style-pbc
[14:51:24] <Levin^> I'm thinking on using a timed animation on css..
[14:52:12] <robertmaxrees> mousewheel events won't work because the fadein/fadeout can meet those conditions outside of the scroll happening.
[14:52:33] <robertmaxrees> any reason that text actualkly needs to be overlaid on the map in the firstr place?
[14:52:34] <Levin^> hm
[14:53:49] <Levin^> there will be a search form in that position, it meets the design made previously from a designer
[14:55:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:55:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:55:27] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:55:30] <Levin^> lol
[14:56:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd go back to your designer and try to find a more reasonable solution.
[14:58:48] <Levin^> oh well
[14:58:59] <fatalix> any devs using winOS need the ability to show your clients your localhost work from airports, hotspots, etc?
[14:59:04] <Levin^> css animation is buggy for this usage until now
[14:59:10] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/oGmNMo
[14:59:19] <Levin^> oh, the link doesn't change
[15:55:21] <Al_nz1> any datatables experienced people here? I need to use render to create a link, but stuggling to relate the example in the docs to my situation
[15:58:00] <taplar> data tables experts don't hang out in here.  they're busy raking in the freelancing fees
[15:59:58] <serrawan> hi there, does anyone know of a jquery library that could help me create fixed position divs that are frozen to the bottom of the screen? i'm trying to create a div that resembeles Olark's live chat widget.
[16:00:49] <taplar> fixed position stuff is pretty simple css
[16:04:48] <serrawan> taplar: ya, i'm hoping to find a library taht will help save me time bc i'd like to create something just like olark's live chat widget.  i.e. a fixed position indicator which expands into a larger div when clicked (and also has some animation effects when not expanded)
[16:08:20] <serrawan> does anyone know what keyword i would use to try to find a plugin that's like olark's live chat widget?
[16:44:25] <morfin> hello
[16:44:45] <morfin> i use async ajax but need to return valeu from function. any good ideas?
[16:45:54] <taplar> you don't return the value from the ajax
[16:46:18] <taplar> you call a callback in the success method, or you attach another method to take the result in a then()
[16:54:02] <morfin> function get_tags(query) {$.ajax({...}).done(function() {return results;})} won't work i thing
[16:54:05] <morfin> *think
[16:54:57] <taplar> you're not accepting the response into that done method
[16:54:58] <taplar> done(function(data){});
[16:55:02] <morfin> problem is that i should suggest tags to plugin
[16:55:07] <taplar> and you still don't return from those
[16:55:21] <taplar> you are operating in an asynchronous pattern.  there isn't a place to return to
[16:55:32] <morfin> that's a point why i am asking
[16:55:44] <morfin> and i should do it with result(tags) which is defined only inside of plugin hmmmm
[16:55:56] <morfin> *response(tags);
[16:56:57] <morfin> i can probably create wrapper around response from inside of plugin and the use it  as callack
[16:57:01] <morfin> *callback
[16:58:09] <hellyeah> o/
[16:58:17] <morfin> \o
[16:58:27] <hellyeah> sup
[16:58:35] <hellyeah> can i show you my blog :D
[17:00:56] <taplar> you don't have to ask to share your blog, man
[17:01:14] <taplar> just so long as your not like spamming the room with it
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:01:54] <morfin> i think it's ugly solution but hm
[17:03:15] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re did you get the help you needed?
[17:04:57] <hellyeah> https://spinningcat.github.io/blog/
[17:05:46] <morfin> http://paste.ubuntu.com/25768258/
[17:06:30] <taplar> so why do you think it's ugly?
[17:08:19] <morfin> because i will create default callback like var callback=function(tags) {}; then override when tagit initialized
[17:08:22] <taplar> and fwiw, you don't -have- to pass in the callback
[17:08:38] <morfin> so i can response(tags); in this callback
[17:08:45] <taplar> you could have the method return the promise from $.ajax, and who ever calls that method can attach a then() to it to do whatever
[17:09:18] <morfin> too bad no await yet
[17:09:46] <taplar> ?
[17:10:19] <morfin> but still will have to use Promise
[17:10:29] <morfin> async/await are coming to JS soon
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> morfin you're kind of half using promises there fwiw.
[17:11:15] <morfin> but $.ajax as i remember returns not promise
[17:11:24] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/k5jxk3Lq/
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> morfin erm.
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[17:11:48] <morfin> huh? i remember it was returning something else hmm
[17:11:51] <taplar> typo in the function call, but yeah, they do
[17:12:00] <robertmaxrees> it returns a deferred, which is a promise.
[17:12:01] <taplar> a deferred is a type of promise object
[17:12:11] <robertmaxrees> jquery 3.x is promises/A+ compliant.
[17:12:32] <robertmaxrees> you can use .then() - in fact, done() is a shortcut for the first arge.
[17:12:33] <robertmaxrees> *arg
[17:14:58] <morfin> btw i use not 3.x =)
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> what version are you on?
[17:15:18] <robertmaxrees> because previous ones also have .then()
[17:15:27] <morfin> yes i know
[17:15:30] <taplar> you can still use then() on the deferred
[17:15:35] <robertmaxrees> there was a bug around how they handled failure cases but the rest of it still works.
[17:16:03] <taplar> so if you know, what's all the fuss?
[17:16:21] <morfin> it returned XMLHttpRequest
[17:16:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:16:34] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing.
[17:16:44] <robertmaxrees> and what version of jq are you on?
[17:17:00] <morfin> something like 1.5 it's ancient site i edit
[17:17:17] <taplar> if it's passing in the xhr, then you'll have to use xhr.responseText to get the content
[17:17:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:17:24] <robertmaxrees> morfin sooo
[17:17:32] <morfin> i know what to do )
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/PnIfcpv.png
[17:17:45] <robertmaxrees> can still use promises.
[17:17:54] <taplar> cool
[17:17:57] <morfin> but not return type
[17:18:01] <morfin> *value
[17:18:12] <robertmaxrees> you can't return values out of callbacks, no.
[17:18:13] <morfin> return value do not have then etc
[17:18:18] <taplar> no, cause it's async
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:18:21] <morfin> i mean from $.ajax
[17:18:31] <robertmaxrees> you mean return $.ajax() ?
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> from within a function?
[17:18:49] <morfin> var test = $.ajax({...}); test.then(function(data) {}); //nope
[17:18:50] <taplar> he's wanting to do synchronous requests
[17:18:56] <morfin> no
[17:19:05] <robertmaxrees> you can do that morfin - you can do test.then
[17:19:21] <morfin> seems like not in old jQuery
[17:19:30] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:19:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:19:32] <robertmaxrees> you can.

[17:21:02] <morfin> what jQuery it use?
[17:21:19] <morfin> i tried with old one - not function
[17:21:47] <randymarsh9> morfin: what version are you on
[17:21:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rnddhe25/1/
[17:21:53] <taplar> using 1.5.0 from google cdn
[17:21:53] <morfin> because it return XMLHttpRequest as i said
[17:21:58] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/DiYxSTD.png
[17:22:01] <morfin> hmm
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> morfin promise is an interface.
[17:23:31] <morfin> yay i switched to newer version and it works
[17:23:41] <morfin> it was even older version(1.4.4) lol
[17:23:48] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:24:03] <morfin> it was returning raw XMLHttpRequest back in time
[17:25:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:40:48] <gambl0re> robert is a jerk...
[17:41:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:41:41] <robertmaxrees> feel free to PM me about it duder :)

[17:48:18] <Al_nz1> trying to work out why the columnDefs works with one or other of these renderers, but not both at the same time : https://pastebin.com/SekJYW4u
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 well
[17:48:57] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you can't give two properties the same name.
[17:49:30] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: how then do you apply two renderers ?
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta make it one.
[17:52:55] <Al_nz1> where would I find the syntax of how that would even loook like
[17:53:15] <robertmaxrees> since you're in datatables land, I'd highly suggest hitting up their forums.
[17:54:10] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok
[17:54:29] <Al_nz1> I dunno if you recall our discussion yesterday - but so far datatables seems a nice way to acheive what I am after'
[17:56:29] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to define a custom render for each column btw?
[17:58:33] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: not every column. I have 5 columns, col 1 is hyperlink, col 5 is a boolean which renders as a icon.
[18:02:14] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: why did you ask?
[18:04:44] <grapheti> This still working in 2017 - Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
[18:07:12] <taplar> grapheti: what are you asking?
[18:07:54] <grapheti> if you can still do it
[18:08:25] <taplar> i'd assume you can.  deprecated doesn't necessarily mean removed
[18:08:48] <taplar> it just conveys the intent to be removed in the future
[18:08:50] <grapheti> I'm callin' these spec managers!
[18:08:54] <grapheti> We need to get on the case!
[18:09:10] <grapheti> It's 2017, sheesh
[18:09:34] <taplar> are you wanting them to be finally removed or .... ?
[18:09:54] <grapheti> I'm just tired of seeing it :P
[18:10:41] <grapheti> Leave me alone. It's been a long day. Dealing with vue and rollup.
[18:10:43] <taplar> i mean, it's kinda there for a reason
[18:11:06] <taplar> rollup?
[18:11:17] <grapheti> https://rollupjs.org/
[18:11:35] <grapheti> https://rollupjs.org/repl
[18:12:05] <taplar> ah, is this like an alternative to webpack or browerify?
[18:12:11] <grapheti> ye
[18:12:37] <taplar> cool
[18:12:38] <grapheti> also got https://buble.surge.sh/
[18:12:55] <grapheti> rollup's code is way smaller
[18:13:06] <grapheti> easier to use from my experience
[18:13:32] <grapheti> tutorial on it - https://code.lengstorf.com/learn-rollup-js/
[18:13:58] <grapheti> it doesn't do code splitting
[18:14:03] <grapheti> I think that's the only thing
[18:14:42] <grapheti> I noticed it when I was looking into https://preactjs.com/
[18:15:43] <taplar> think i'll stick with webpack for now
[18:16:18] <grapheti> ye, webpack just gave me headaches
[18:16:55] <grapheti> I just said f it and switched
[18:18:18] <taplar> if i get the time i'm going to try to use just npm scripts to compile vue
[18:18:49] <grapheti> fancy
[18:24:48] <grapheti> prolly safe to stick with webpack tho
[18:25:03] <grapheti> they look similar in configuration lol - http://recordit.co/O8e4IlAY4m
[18:26:58] <taplar> yeah i got some of that feel when i was looking at the stuff you shared
[18:27:06] <grapheti> :D
[18:27:17] <grapheti> rollup reminds me more of gulp
[18:27:26] <grapheti> I <3'd gulp
[18:27:39] <grapheti> well, I guess I still do :P
[18:30:37] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeee
[18:35:20] <grapheti> taplar, so what's a good reason for keeping something deprecated forever?
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> talking about DOM apis?
[18:35:42] <grapheti> ajax sync
[18:35:54] <grapheti> specifically
[18:35:58] <robertmaxrees> because the moment you kill it a ton if sites stop working.
[18:36:01] <taplar> market usage
[18:36:05] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[18:36:27] <grapheti> ain't nutten gonna change
[18:36:33] <robertmaxrees> it is changing.
[18:36:49] <robertmaxrees> new stuff is better. but you can't just kill off certain things.
[18:37:00] <grapheti> ye
[18:37:09] <robertmaxrees> if you do, what happens to the sites that break?
[18:37:20] <grapheti> they code more modern stuff?
[18:37:21] <grapheti> :D
[18:37:36] <grapheti> that's not prone to exploits
[18:37:37] <robertmaxrees> people do.  but the issue isn't usually new projects - it's the legacy sites that are still out there.
[18:37:51] <taplar> and potentially lose tons of $$$ while they are down
[18:37:51] <taplar> not to mention the bad press that their site stops working
[18:37:53] <grapheti> ye
[18:37:57] <robertmaxrees> i mean, hell, spacejam.com
[18:38:02] <robertmaxrees> still around./
[18:38:04] <grapheti> haha
[18:38:08] <grapheti> can't believe that still exists
[18:38:11] <grapheti> that's awesome
[18:38:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:38:47] <taplar> why tf you guys dissin space jam?!?!
[18:38:47] * taplar storms out
[18:39:02] <grapheti> I say force people to use something that's more maintained, but I see valid points in keeping it.
[18:39:22] <grapheti> LOL TAPLAR
[18:39:24] <taplar> you just have to try to continually educate people
[18:39:36] <robertmaxrees> grapheti the sad reality is that plenty of shops don't have the kind of manpower it would take to fix that stuff.
[18:39:40] <grapheti> I need to build something in this - http://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/
[18:39:44] <grapheti> one day
[18:39:51] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason banks are still using COBOL
[18:40:51] <taplar> and us
[18:40:54] <taplar> :D
[18:41:04] <robertmaxrees> hah, I'm, not surprised.
[18:41:15] <robertmaxrees> hell, we're still on CF>
[18:41:19] <robertmaxrees> for a lot of stuff.
[18:44:12] <madprops> hi
[18:44:15] <madprops> why wont this work? https://paste.ee/p/AnOkQ
[18:44:39] <taplar> gotta explain the issue man
[18:44:54] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[18:44:57] <robertmaxrees> can't read your mind.
[18:45:17] <madprops> sorry
[18:45:21] <robertmaxrees> also: $($("#chat_scrollbar > .nicescroll-cursors").get(0)).css("background-color", "black !important")
[18:45:47] <robertmaxrees> just do $("#chat_scrollbar > .nicescroll-cursors").eq(0)
[18:46:37] <madprops> nice i wondered about that, a way to select without losing the jquery instance
[18:46:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.  so what here doesn't work?
[18:46:52] <madprops> what im trying to do is change a scrollbar color
[18:46:59] <madprops> it resides inside #chat_scrollbar
[18:47:07] <madprops> with class "nicescroll-cursors"
[18:47:17] <taplar> the window scrollbar?
[18:47:31] <madprops> it's from a library - -- nicescroll
[18:47:49] <madprops> if i set it up in the css file like this https://paste.ee/p/4uh17
[18:47:50] <madprops> it works
[18:48:01] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:48:09] <robertmaxrees> #chat_scrollbar > .nicescroll-cursors and #chat_scrollbar .nicescroll-cursors are different operations.
[18:48:11] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[18:48:24] <madprops> i know i tried both
[18:48:36] <madprops> also it's directly under chat_scrollbar
[18:48:39] <robertmaxrees> so background-color isn't getting set?
[18:49:02] <taplar> i forget, can you do !important in inline css?
[18:49:21] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[18:49:29] <madprops> https://paste.ee/p/1iU4N
[18:49:51] <madprops> background-color is not changing when i retrieve it with css or visually
[18:50:02] <madprops> scrollbar remains the same color
[18:50:56] <taplar> in your browser, if you right click on the element and make that change to it with the styles, does it change the bg color?
[18:50:56] <robertmaxrees> what if you do .css('background', '').css('background-color' etc
[18:51:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ this too
[18:51:57] <madprops> yep https://i.imgur.com/BAZowJo.jpg
[18:52:27] <robertmaxrees> and you're running this code after you init nicescroll, right?
[18:52:40] <madprops> https://paste.ee/p/XYXdv
[18:52:42] <taplar> the black is crossed out on that image
[18:52:45] <madprops> yeah after init
[18:52:49] <taplar> try putting !important on the crossed out part
[18:53:41] <taplar> i kinda want to suggest just making a css class with this effect and adding the class to the elements, instead of trying to set css
[18:54:10] <madprops> thing is it can be any color, it's dynamic stuff
[18:54:27] <madprops> also i don't see the black in the inspector anymore
[18:55:00] <madprops> ok interesting
[18:55:11] <madprops> if i don't use !important, it shows the crossed out black
[18:55:16] <madprops> if i use !important it shows nothing
[18:55:23] <madprops> seems !important is not working
[18:55:29] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:55:40] <madprops> v2.1.1 btw
[18:55:42] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not using the nicescroll api?
[18:55:59] <madprops> i haven't find a call to change the background color
[18:56:09] <madprops> jquery v2.1.1*
[18:56:16] <madprops> i fear it might be too outdated
[18:56:21] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/inuyaksa/jquery.nicescroll#configuration-parameters
[18:56:45] <madprops> yeah i can set it when starting the instance
[18:56:47] <madprops> but not after afaik
[18:56:58] <robertmaxrees> have... have you tried?
[18:57:07] <madprops> not a lot :d
[18:57:17] <madprops> i did try to find an options/parameter object
[18:57:24] <madprops> or a "background" call
[18:57:37] <madprops> since it has "background: "", // change css for rail background"
[18:57:47] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure it's "cursorcolor"
[18:57:51] <madprops> yeah that's the one
[18:58:03] <robertmaxrees> right, the settings allow you to change that.
[18:58:28] <madprops> but when instantiating
[18:58:36] <robertmaxrees> have you tried after instantiating?
[18:58:45] <madprops> i can't find a way to change it
[18:58:56] <madprops> there's no call
[18:59:05] <madprops> or setting
[18:59:11] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/inuyaksa/jquery.nicescroll#configuration-parameters
[18:59:23] <madprops> i mean
[18:59:29] <madprops> no setting in the createdi nstance
[18:59:33] <robertmaxrees> l;ol
[18:59:36] <madprops> i know that exists i've seen that list like a thousand times
[18:59:37] <robertmaxrees> just try doing $("#thisdiv").niceScroll({cursorcolor:"#00F"});
[18:59:41] <taplar> use the api if you can, but ah ha!  https://jsfiddle.net/s99h7pte/
[18:59:43] <robertmaxrees> like, after init.
[19:00:02] <madprops> ohhhhh taplar
[19:01:25] <taplar> may not work in IE
[19:01:40] <madprops> lol
[19:02:05] <madprops> yep that works
[19:02:14] <madprops> weird that important doesnt work with jquery
[19:02:24] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[19:02:25] <madprops> maybe it's my version
[19:02:31] <madprops> what's the current version?
[19:02:34] <robertmaxrees> did you try my suggestion?
[19:02:38] <madprops> not yet
[19:02:47] <madprops> let me see
[19:02:51] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot.  i'd be interested to see if that works.
[19:02:52] <taplar> i couldn't get the important to set with the latest version
[19:03:01] <taplar> not sure what i was missing
[19:03:35] <madprops> no it doesn't change it robertmaxrees
[19:03:39] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[19:04:33] <madprops> thanks my dudes
