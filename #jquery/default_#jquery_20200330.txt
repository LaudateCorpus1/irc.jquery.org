[00:45:25] <Cork> Samian: as what you have for each entry is a timestamp, that is what i would use
[00:45:58] <Cork> cause if you need to have jumps in the list it becomes very easy to get corrupt data
[00:46:36] <Cork> while if you have a timestamp and need to convert between two points you will have an absolute point in time and the math is easy to do
[00:48:31] <Cork> only situation i wouldn't do it that way is if data abbrevity is more important then data correctness
[00:52:15] <Samian> Cork right. I'd need to keep the list contiguous
[00:53:14] <Cork> not only that, your infer data instaed of sending it
[00:53:32] <Cork> and from experience that tend to be a bad idea
[00:53:41] <Cork> (well except for positions)
[00:54:20] <Samian> aha cool
[00:54:21] <Samian> okay
[00:54:21] <Samian> thanks
[04:41:08] <krambiorix> hi, i have an unordered list with about 5 list items. I want them infinitely, one per one, slide in from the right, show 5 seconds and then hide and repeat again from the first one.
[04:41:12] <krambiorix> anyone?
[04:42:03] <Cork> krambiorix: you normally have to build the slideshow a lot differently if you want infinity
[04:42:19] <Cork> as you have to move the element from the beginning to the end of the list when they have moved out of view
[04:42:34] <Cork> and if they are inline elements that means you will get a jump
[04:43:14] <krambiorix> ow ok
[04:44:15] <Cork> and by move i mean move in the dom btw
[04:44:24] <Cork> [1,2,3,4] => [2,3,4,1]
[04:45:30] <Cork> so you most likely want to look into one of the many slideshow plugins, as a starting point if nothing else
[04:47:02] <krambiorix> i have this now: https://jsfiddle.net/z9h80rmx/
[04:48:23] <Cork> oh, don't forget you need to use requestAnimationFrame else you will get broken animations if the tab colses focus
[04:58:40] <Uhkis> "marquee" ;D
[05:00:40] <Cork> colses... @_@''
[05:00:43] <Cork> *loses
[09:24:51] <asdfgh> hello everybody
[09:24:59] <asdfgh> is there a way to clean input fields that are not shown ?
[09:25:35] <asdfgh> i mean that i have something like <div class="d-none"><input text=""></div> how can i clean that inputs?
[09:25:43] <Cork> asdfgh: clean?
[09:25:54] <Cork> same as you clear any inputfield
[09:25:58] <Cork> .val('')
[09:26:28] <asdfgh> Cork, no wait i only need to clear invisible input fields
[09:26:37] <asdfgh> with "invisible" i do not mean "hidden"
[09:26:52] <Cork> so you mean not rendered field
[09:26:55] <asdfgh> i mean the input fields the user can see because i use a display none on its container
[09:26:56] <Cork> and no you cna't
[09:27:01] <Cork> *can't
[09:27:34] <asdfgh> why not? for exmaple if i now the class like "d-none" why can i not clear the input field inside such divs ?
[09:28:53] <Cork> cause that is finding all input fields with a class, not with a rendering status
[09:29:14] <Cork> $('.d-none input').val('')
[09:29:23] <Cork> but it won't care about if the element is rendered or not)
[09:29:52] <asdfgh> Cork, yes, ok, but if there is d-none i am 100% that element is not shown
[09:29:57] <asdfgh> pardon i do not get your point
[09:30:26] <Cork> asdfgh: you can make a group selection for all input fields with a parent class above it, i just gave it to you
[09:30:46] <Cork> but it will only mean "find all input elements with .d-none at any parent element"
[09:30:47] <Cork> nothing else
[09:32:26] <asdfgh> yeah ok that enought.... Cork, wait one related question....if i do .val() on a select does it clear the selected option only right? i mena, can i securely call .val() on every input right?
