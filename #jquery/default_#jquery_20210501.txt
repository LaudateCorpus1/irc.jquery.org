[10:54:22] <pavonia> robertmaxrees: In case you are interested, the problem seemed to be that getSubDocument doesn't work when you include the content directly, but it works if you load it via src: https://jsbin.com/lohulupupu/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:57:42] <pavonia> Also you were right, click handlers do work with <object> too. Many of the StackOverflow answers seems to be just wrong or outdated :S
[10:58:06] <pavonia> Can't reproduce my original problem for now, though
[13:18:23] <robertmaxrees> pavonia a lot of the SO answers I found said that <object> works.  i think maybe the confusion was around CORS, not around <object> :)
