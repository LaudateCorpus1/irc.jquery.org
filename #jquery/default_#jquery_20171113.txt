[00:16:51] <GJ> Hey all, need some help... don't know why this wont trigger and run... $("#provider-remote").easyAutocomplete(options);
[01:26:38] <Cork> GJ: have you loaded the plugin?
[01:27:52] <Neo1> I need load scripts from head async, how can I do it?
[01:28:01] <Neo1> without blocking
[03:56:59] <ClydeSlims> Keep getting invalid token? $(".mainHeader").css("transform", "translate(20%,0%)");â€‹
[03:58:33] <Cork> wfm https://jsfiddle.net/q5kvbpm0/
[03:59:02] <Cork> make sure your editor haven't put any unprintable characters in your .js file
[04:01:51] <ClydeSlims> Cork, that was it, thank you
[04:02:18] <ClydeSlims> there was a character at the end
[04:02:24] <ClydeSlims> Cork, do you use Atom?
[04:02:34] <Cork> nope, sublime ftw
[04:31:54] <Neo1> (yummi)
[06:11:51] <anli> What happened with the checkbox to turn of any more alerts from a webpage?
[06:12:02] <anli> (google chrome)
[06:25:54] <Cork> anli: it stores a setting for the site that forbids popups
[06:26:12] <Cork> click the icon to the left of the url in the url bar
[06:32:15] <anli> I only want to prevent more alerts for the current request
[06:33:50] <Cork> then you would have to handle that in the page; the browser don't have that granularity
[07:14:40] <anli> It had when the checkbox existed.
[07:14:59] <anli> But maybe you still use ff?
[07:15:06] <anli> I think its there as well.
[07:15:28] <Cork> it works in both
[07:15:46] <Cork> but it works the same, it blocks popups, not in relation to a specific request
[07:16:09] <anli> When the browser is reloaded, they come up again for that page
[07:16:15] <anli> Until you check the box
[07:16:53] <Cork> either way, take it to a support channel for the browser
[07:17:30] <anli> So the function is not moved elsewhere?
[07:17:54] <anli> To be clear about which checkbox I mean, its the one discussed on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11729835/how-to-disable-prevent-this-page-from-creating-additional-dialogs
[07:19:14] <Woet> anli: what is your jQuery question?
[07:19:23] <Cork> there isn't one
[07:19:40] <Woet> that's the hint i'm trying to give him, yes
[07:20:24] <anli> Where is the #prevent-this-page-from-creating-additional-dialogs irc channel when I need it
[07:20:48] <codecutter>  Hover over one of the links  'Foo', then move it on to the black box that appears, notice how the popup disappears, it should be remain visible, unless cursor is not on the hovered link or the popup. Pretty trivial if the popup was appended as a child but in case its added to one of its parents - https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/887dkyjh/1/
[07:20:59] <Woet> to be honest i don't even get your off-topic question
[07:21:06] <anli> oh, cannot have dashes
[07:21:12] <Woet> don't use alert if you want full control over it
[07:21:24] <anli> I do not want full control, only the one I had before
[07:21:49] <Woet> so downgrade / switch to a browser version that does what you wnat.
[07:22:15] <Cork> codecutter: the overlay need to be a child
[07:22:17] <anli> I did not seek or an advise like that, only an answer if the functionality has moved
[07:22:33] <Cork> codecutter: currently it is a sibling, so you are mouseleave:ing when you mouse onto it
[07:23:54] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/887dkyjh/2/
[07:26:14] <codecutter> Cork: it has to be appended to the parent (div.wrapper)
[07:26:27] <Cork> codecutter: then you can't use mouseenter
[07:27:12] <codecutter> ok, can i see a fiddle?
[07:27:25] <Cork> i'm not even sure i can manage to get it to work
[07:27:35] <codecutter> hmm
[07:27:39] <Cork> you would have to check what new element you mouseinto when you leave an element
[07:27:46] <Cork> and if it is the popup, don't do anything
[07:27:54] <Cork> and then handle all the cross cases
[07:28:18] <Cork> as you can't use the dom tree to help you it becomes hard and fragile
[07:28:33] <Cork> i've done it once a long time a go, but it never worked well
[07:28:44] <codecutter> so it has to be a child?
[07:30:18] <codecutter> someone over at js gave me this but it dosn;t take into account multiple links -https://jsfiddle.net/46njng3n/

[09:24:54] <nopolitica> hey guys! I'm having troubles with $.ajax request, which is being sent ok and status is 200 and i've got small json object in response, but it still treats it as an error
[09:25:15] <Cork> nopolitica: bind .fail and check the arguments
[09:25:20] <Cork> it might be code parsing error
[09:27:49] <nopolitica> Cork: error is being used, so fail can't execute (
[09:27:57] <nopolitica> Cork: * error callback
[09:28:07] <nopolitica> https://gist.github.com/dongalor/b553ff26e8d6a30368ff561be2ff7b68
[09:28:10] <Cork> error doesn't block fail
[09:28:11] <nopolitica> here's my request
[09:28:32] <Cork> alert does though (don't use alet for debugging)
[09:28:34] <nopolitica> Cork: https://gist.github.com/dongalor/b553ff26e8d6a30368ff561be2ff7b68
[09:28:51] <nopolitica> Cork: ok, updated to console.log
[09:29:50] <nopolitica> Cork: https://gist.github.com/dongalor/b553ff26e8d6a30368ff561be2ff7b68 updated to this
[09:30:06] <nopolitica> Cork: Error: error, err in console
[09:31:02] <Cork> and what does the error callback print (as you don't have the third argument in .fail)
[09:31:35] <Cork> (the correct syntax is fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {}) )
[09:32:06] <Cork> nopolitica: also is this called from http://localhost:1337 ?
[09:32:16] <Cork> meaning is the request comming from the same domain as the api?
[09:32:35] <nopolitica> Cork: res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:63342/');
[09:32:45] <nopolitica> maybe it's some header problem?
[09:32:51] <Cork> on the server i hope?
[09:32:57] <Cork> cause you can't do that from the client
[09:34:07] <Cork> the point of cors is to protect servers, and that is why clients can't control it
[09:35:09] <nopolitica> Cork: damn it, restarted server and now it works )
[09:35:21] <nopolitica> Cork: thank you soooo much for support!
[09:35:25] <Cork> np
[10:19:14] <Neo1> what does means defer?
[10:19:41] <Neo1> Cork: ??? Do you often use this word? I've learned it recent
[10:20:04] <Neo1> defer and async What is differ?
[10:21:37] <taplar> I don't see where Cork said defer in the logs.
[10:23:16] <taplar> But in general the use of "defer" typically means to "put off" or "delay"
[10:38:48] <sinopia> Hi, I can't figure out why this error starting showing: Uncaught TypeError: maxItem_also_pur_prods_block.outerHeight is not a function (it worked perfectly and didn't change it or the version of jQuery)
[10:39:35] <sinopia> Can it be a conflict from some another script? The last thing I could possibility change was adding a script but not is this page only for index.php
[10:39:37] <Woet> sinopia: show your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[10:41:25] <sinopia> https://jsfiddle.net/498Ltmre/ -> the problem is that it stops the rest of scripts running
[10:43:30] <sinopia> I think this code is messing with the rest -> https://jsfiddle.net/1wjw62xf/
[10:43:45] <sinopia> this is when it run the scripts that give me that error
[10:46:22] <Woet> sinopia: i didn't ask for a paste, i asked for a test case
[10:46:28] <Woet> sinopia: a working example of the issue that you're facing.
[10:51:04] <taplar> sinopia: side note, don't do this -> $(this).attr("id")
[10:51:07] <taplar> just use this.id
[10:52:01] <alexidoia> Hello,
[10:53:13] <alexidoia> I am looking for to display a bunch of photographs, like they were laied down a table and make the user move them around, a little like this unfinished attempt : http://idoia.com/tripoli/
[10:53:33] <alexidoia> If anyone knows an already made script, I would not want to redo the wheel
[10:53:35] <alexidoia> many thanks
[10:57:41] <alexidoia> Anyone ?
[11:41:43] <Neo1> taplar: oh now, I mean <script differ src=''></script>
[11:42:31] <Neo1> taplar, it's do scripts which is inside <head> load after html
[11:42:39] <Neo1> or asynhronicaly
[11:42:51] <taplar> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-script-element
[11:42:53] <Neo1> I now optimizing site and this help
[11:44:50] <Neo1> taplar: yes, see if we add defer scripts load after DOM and they load in queue? Probably yes, and if we add async How will they load? It need to do research
[11:45:29] <Neo1> I today only learned this attribute and what it mean as English word
[11:47:44] <Neo1> for optimization it's really good possibility. Don't need put all scripts to footer, just add defer and site will load faster. Validators won't show errors as put off blocking scripts from header. I've checked it
[11:48:17] <Neo1> taplar: Where do you think should include jQuery?
[11:48:44] <taplar> i put mine at the bottom
[11:49:54] <Neo1> taplar: I leave jQuery in header, just it as javascript Environment for to be accessible on all document. I thinks it's necessary put in header. Before I also put in footer
[11:50:18] <taplar> no, putting it in the head vs the footer doesn't make it any less global
[11:52:01] <Neo1> taplar: no see we have on site text editor and I turned on html regime. I can put <script>jQuery code</script> and <style>my style</style> and everything will work. if we put to bottom we wont use it
[11:52:26] <taplar> right because you have jquery script before the include
[11:52:33] <Neo1> taplar: it's very useful for create unique pages through editor
[11:54:22] <Neo1> taplar: yes, and I was doing optimization deleted 'defer' from <script> of include jQuery and because it called errors in console
[11:55:10] <taplar> right, cause the script wouldn't be loaded when the code that needs it runs
[11:55:13] <Neo1> taplar: shortly better put in header jQuery and all other staff in bottom. It's my mind, Puting it in bottom we won't got much benefits
[11:55:49] <taplar> sure if you have script in your body, though i would question why you are required to have script in your middle body
[11:56:20] <Neo1> taplar: yes, and see I have got experience creating WP plugins, wp plugins put to page using shortcode, shortcode put text in middle
[11:56:27] <Neo1> taplar: sometimes this is need to do
[11:56:38] <taplar> ok
[11:57:36] <Neo1> taplar: as I created plugin I use shortode which put html text in middle and I use bored javascript to do ajax request because I pretend jQuery can be in bottom.
[11:58:42] <Neo1> there was script where I can't put code to file that wp plugin to include after  including of jQuery
[12:00:16] <Neo1> ok passed this, I can't describe what I've did with my plugin. but nevertheless it seems header is better
[12:00:40] <Neo1> only jQuery as javascript Environment
[12:01:02] <Neo1> to do global access in all document
[12:01:31] <taplar> i don't understand what you mean by javascript environment
[12:02:12] <Neo1> taplar: I mean jQuery will always accessible to you if it in header
[12:02:30] <taplar> right, but why are you saying "javascript environment" ?
[12:03:17] <Neo1> taplar: <head>jQuery</head> and it is for me as Javascript environment for all document
[12:03:36] <taplar> it's not an environment.  i don't know why you keep using that word
[12:03:42] <taplar> you're just including a library
[12:05:06] <Neo1> taplar: including lib and extending javascript environment. It is as we modernized javascript environment
[12:05:14] <taplar> no dude
[12:05:16] <Neo1> I use it imaginary
[12:05:20] <taplar> don't
[12:05:21] <taplar> lol
[12:05:23] <Neo1> we can imagine it
[12:05:27] <taplar> no one will know what you are talking about
[12:05:38] <taplar> you are just using a library.  you are not extending anything
[12:06:40] <taplar> if anything an ES shim would extend javascript.  jQuery does not
[12:06:53] <Neo1> taplar: for me, yes in reality. You can imagine for yourself this as new environment that is expended. or you will use clean javascript if anywhere presents jQuery?
[12:07:11] <taplar> whatever dude.
[12:07:30] <Neo1> taplar: :)
[12:08:19] <Neo1> taplar: to think globally
[12:08:21] <Neo1> ..
[12:08:45] <taplar> if you have a question about jQuery dude feel free to ask.  i'm not going to have a conversation with out about some made up terms you like
[12:08:55] <Neo1> defer and async, In the world so many unknown things...
[12:09:29] <Neo1> taplar: ok, I am going to leave now, its getting late, should go to shop
[12:09:35] <Neo1> taplar: :)
[12:10:38] <Neo1> ah, I'll leave*
[13:57:20] <codecutter> Cork: around?
[14:09:09] <taplar> codecutter: he's an early morning guy usually
[14:09:20] <taplar> at least from the states perspective
[14:09:44] <codecutter> early bird gets the worm :)
[14:10:04] <codecutter>  Hover over one of the links  'Foo', then move it on to the black box that appears, notice how the popup disappears, it should be remain visible, unless cursor is not on the hovered link or the popup. I know this is pretty trivial if the popup was appended as a child but in case its added to one of its parents - https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/887dkyjh/1/
[14:10:08] <taplar> i'll take sleep instead
[14:11:54] <taplar> it's got something to do with it's layout
[14:12:06] <taplar> the mouse is going from the text to some whitespace before the popup
[14:12:16] <taplar> that whitespace is being considered 'not the wrapper'
[14:12:41] <codecutter> i know the cause, just not sure how to fix it
[14:13:17] <taplar> you'll have to come up with some kinda delay or something most likely
[14:13:25] <taplar> this is why these hover over display menus are a pita
[14:13:59] <codecutter> can i see a jsfiddle?
[14:14:02] <codecutter> :)
[14:15:21] <taplar> oh wait
[14:15:32] <taplar> your mouse enter/leave is actually on the link, not the wrapper area
[14:16:50] <codecutter> thats the way it should be
[14:17:24] <codecutter> if its on the wrapper then popup wont hide (must disappear if its not on the link or popup)
[14:20:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/887dkyjh/4/  something like that perhaps
[14:22:45] <codecutter> does not work
[14:24:59] <taplar> should give you an idea though hopefully
[14:27:01] <codecutter> ok, thx
[14:32:35] <vish93> Hi guy I have the following code for a back to top link but upon fadeOut the element flashes twice: https://jsfiddle.net/b5o2dk9k/9/ how can I stop this happening ?
[14:33:50] <taplar> i'm not seeing it in chrome.  any particular resolution or browser you see this in?
[14:34:50] <vish93> taplar: Chrome latest update and my resolution is 1366 x 768
[14:35:45] <taplar> heh, now if i scroll top bottom top bottom over and over real fast i see it blink
[14:36:35] <vish93> taplar: very strange cannot see why it is happening
[14:36:47] <taplar> cause animations stack
[14:42:51] <taplar> you can terminate the previously running animation by doing calling stop or finish, but so far doing so looks to make the fade in/out just act like a show/hide for me
[14:49:11] <taplar> hah, i bet i know why though
[14:49:47] <vish93> taplar: I am having a brain fart
[14:50:11] <taplar> one sec.  scroll fires a ton of times.  you need to throttle/debouce this logic
[14:50:48] <taplar> it's kinda weird.  this has been coming up a lot lately
[14:51:11] <vish93> taplar: this has got it to stop https://jsfiddle.net/b5o2dk9k/12/
[14:53:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/b5o2dk9k/13/
[14:55:14] <vish93> taplar: silly question what is the benefit of your way?
[14:55:45] <robertmaxrees> running $() inside of scroll listeners is a bad idea.
[14:56:16] <robertmaxrees> in fact, running just about anything in scroll listeners is a bad idea
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> so anything you can do to reduce the amount of code being run is generally a good idea.
[14:57:09] <taplar> debouncing will cause the action to not process until after the time threshold of inactivity has passed
[14:57:32] <taplar> so 100 milliseconds after the last scroll event, it'll fire
[14:57:44] <taplar> vs firing for all the scroll events that happen in quick succession
[15:02:04] <vish93> makes sense, thanks for help guys :)
[16:10:41] <ashzade> Hi Everyone. I'm going a bit nuts. I'm getting an error (InvalidStateError (DOM Exception 11): The object is in an invalid state.) with this code and can't tell why: https://jsfiddle.net/4pu5agjb/ Everything I google says something about ajax, which I'm not doing.
[16:10:50] <ashzade> I'm just applying a mask on input fields
[16:13:22] <robertmaxrees> ashzade any way you could flesh that fiddle out a bit more to get the error to happen?
[16:14:45] <ashzade> Robertmaxrees: it's using Drupal so it's messy. I'll see what I can add
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> should be trivial.
[16:15:06] <robertmaxrees> just need a fragment that'll trigger the body of that if.
[16:16:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4pu5agjb/1/ ashzade
[16:16:26] <robertmaxrees> not seeing the error happen here.
[16:18:15] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: I'll add a few fields and see what happens
[16:18:19] <robertmaxrees> a3lright.
[16:18:21] <robertmaxrees> *alright
[16:18:47] <taplar> i kinda want to suggest joining the selectors and filtering by value
[16:19:17] <taplar> not the issue, but that's a sizable array
[16:20:31] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: it seems to work with a selection of fields. I'm thinking one of the fields is causing an issue but don't know how to figure out which one
[16:20:38] <ashzade> taplar: do you mean me and my array?
[16:20:48] <taplar> ya
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> ashzade you can use try/catch for that
[16:21:47] <robertmaxrees> and pop a debugger statement into the catch.
[16:21:57] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: good idea. I just deleted the bottom half of the items and it worked so I know it's the second half
[16:22:06] <ashzade> taplar: I'm all ears on how to optimize this beast
[16:22:32] <robertmaxrees> ashzade any reason you don't have a particular class to denote this, instead of an array of classes?
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> like, .mask-money or something like that?
[16:23:47] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: that's a good idea actually, to just add the class. I was just thinking how I could make this more dynamic. I think I can add a class to the fields I want
[16:24:14] <taplar> +1000
[16:24:26] <robertmaxrees> do that then, instead of having a big ol array of classes.
[16:25:17] <ashzade> It's been a pain to maintain and obviously causing issues. That will probably solve it
[16:25:58] <taplar> and it will be more readable
[16:26:20] <taplar> this element has "mask-money" on it?  ooooh, i know what's going to happen to this guy
[16:26:50] <taplar> tha fk?  why is this masked?  how do i stop that?
[16:27:25] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: ++
[16:27:29] <ashzade> taplar: ++
[16:27:39] <ashzade> so much simpler!
[16:28:01] <taplar> but yeah, also do the filter
[16:28:13] <ashzade> instead of each?
[16:28:20] <taplar> no no you'll still each
[16:28:26] <taplar> but your inner logic has an if on the value
[16:28:30] <taplar> put that part in the filter
[16:28:52] <taplar> $(selector).filter(function(){ return this.value.trim(); }).each(...
[16:29:31] <taplar> ^ will only each over the elements that have a non empty value
[19:14:21] <ashzade> Hi Everyone, I was here earlier today with a '(DOM Exception 11): The object is in an invalid state.' error. I've finally found the culprit but don't know why it's happening. https://jsfiddle.net/582rnpow/ I have a bunch of text fields that I'm applying a mask to.
[19:17:10] <ashzade> Aaaand I think I found it: I was applying it to an input field for a file upload
[19:17:19] <ashzade> I need to be more specific and say the type of input field
[19:17:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:17:34] <robertmaxrees> hence the suggestion for using a class :)
[19:18:33] <ashzade> robertmaxrees: the class didn't work because of the same issue: I was applying it to all input fields on the page
[19:18:36] <ashzade> Dump mistake
[19:18:39] <ashzade> *dumb
[19:18:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:18:58] <robertmaxrees> makes sense.
[19:19:31] <ashzade> Thanks again for your help today
