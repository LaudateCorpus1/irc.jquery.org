[07:27:57] <lord4163> hello
[07:28:40] <lord4163> Why doesn't jquery remove the span? https://jsfiddle.net/m36aer78/1/
[07:30:48] <lord4163> Hellooooo?
[07:45:36] <pavonia> lord4163: I think it only removes from the already given set of elements, but doesn't look for children in that
[07:46:22] <lord4163> var ip = $(event.target).clone(); ip.find("span").remove(); ip = ip.html().trim();
[07:46:28] <lord4163> this seems to do what I want
[12:22:39] <halo> which jquery libs works with jquery mobile ?
[12:32:25] <jak2000> hi halo
[14:49:41] <sine0> im trying to target an img tag that is within a container
[14:50:45] <sine0> $("#container-id").children('img').attr('src', 'https://bbc.co.uk/lulz.jpg');
[14:50:52] <sine0> would this be right ?
[15:11:54] <pavonia> sine0: Looks right if the <img> is a direct child node of the container
[15:12:20] <pavonia> But then you can also use $("#container-id > img").attr(...);
[15:16:48] <sine0> pavonia: its the direct child of a span tag with the id and class of abc
[15:17:46] <sine0> there is a <div><table><span><img>
[15:18:25] <pavonia> Oh, it won't work then, use .find instead of .children
[15:19:28] <pavonia> Errr wait, the span is #container-id or the div?
[15:21:14] <sine0> its wordpress, the container that you can put an id or class to is in fact a span containing the img tag. im just trying to get at it
[15:21:59] <pavonia> If it's the span then it's fine
[15:22:45] <sine0> ttps://snag.gy/bdNvy7.jpg
[15:22:51] <sine0> https://snag.gy/bdNvy7.jpg
[15:23:06] <sine0> not sure what happened to the h on that one.
[15:23:29] <sine0> I set the span to have balimg
[15:23:31] <sine0> as the id
[15:27:36] <rizonz> why the hack! is .append() not working as it should
[15:36:36] <rizonz> can I do an appendTo something like <li><div>cdd<div><div>APPEND HERE</div></li>
[15:42:53] <pavonia> append() should work for that
[15:44:48] <pavonia> rizonz: https://jsfiddle.net/1uf62Lgz/
[15:47:09] <rizonz> pavonia: meh doesn't checking yoru example :)
[15:47:55] <rizonz> pavonia: that is not in it
[15:48:10] <rizonz> I think I need appendChild
[15:48:48] <rizonz> or is that not valid anymore ?
[15:50:28] <pavonia> It is, but it's not a JQuery method
[15:50:34] <rizonz> ok
[15:50:46] <rizonz> mhh or do I need appendTo ?
[15:50:54] <pavonia> But not sure what you're really trying to do
[15:51:34] <rizonz> sec
[15:52:23] <rizonz> <li><div>cdd</div><div>APPEND HERE</div></li> I need to add the divs to the li
[15:52:42] <rizonz> so oh wrong example
[15:52:59] <rizonz> <li><div><div>APPEND HERE</div></div></li> I need to add the divs to the li
[15:54:22] <pavonia> And what's the problem with append() then?
[15:56:33] <rizonz> when I have the li, I append a div in it... goes well but then thje append from the to to that dive doesn't put it inside
[15:56:39] <rizonz> it puts it below it
[16:00:53] <rizonz> pavonia: get the issue ?
[16:04:39] <pavonia> Yes, seems it doesn't return the new elements but the old query
[16:04:51] <pavonia> So you have to use a new query, I guess
[16:05:08] <rizonz> from the previous ?
[16:06:43] <pavonia> I mean in $("#foo").append().append() the second one is appended to #foo, not the first appended element
[16:07:32] <rizonz> yeah sec, something else going on here
[16:07:39] <rizonz> or can I simply mix with appenChild ?
[16:07:43] <rizonz> *appendChild
[16:09:50] <pavonia> appendChild doesn't seem to be different from append in that matter
[16:10:26] <rizonz> yeah indeed
[16:10:35] <rizonz> so what's best ?
[16:15:35] <pavonia> Can't you just add the nested divs in one append, like .append("<div><div>blah</div></div>")? That would be the easiest solution
[16:19:29] <rizonz> it would be but I need to add test to the button
[16:19:32] <rizonz> *text
[16:19:37] <rizonz> as a variable
[16:19:47] <rizonz> so as .text()
[16:22:03] <pavonia> rizonz: Here are two solutions: https://jsfiddle.net/1uf62Lgz/2/ Nothe the nested queries in the second one
[16:22:30] <pavonia> You could also store the inner query in a new var if your want to do other things with it
[16:23:59] <rizonz> yap, thanks a lot!
[16:24:37] <rizonz> pavonia: I think the append in append is nice
[16:24:45] <rizonz> I think I did such thing in the past as well
[16:44:27] <rizonz> pavonia: thanks for lining me up again, I need to kiss you!
[16:46:00] <pavonia> No problem :p
[16:48:33] <rizonz> pavonia: I'm not very good @ JS and Jquery and so on but because of that I see unlogic things of devs
[17:42:49] <sine0> If i run some js code on a page where there is an image and use the $(".fusion-imageframe").find('img').attr('src', 'https blah
[17:42:58] <sine0> it should update and change the image correct ?
[17:43:29] <sine0> how can i get it to find any image anywhere on the page and change it
[17:43:45] <sine0> ive tried variations i want to know if i can do it, i have had no luck yet
[17:46:31] <Tohuw> Hello, I want to get the value of a placeholder for an input field, store it in a variable, then reset the field to its placeholder on a certain event.  Looks like $('#my_input').val() just returns NULL, which does make sense, but how do I get the placeholder value then?
[17:48:50] <Tohuw> The root of the challenge is that $('#my_input').val('') sets the field to blank, not its placeholder
[17:57:32] <pavonia> sine0: Any image would be $("img").attr(...)
[17:58:19] <sine0> ok ive just checked the code! its changing the image but the page is not updating!?!
[17:59:00] <sine0> it has probably been working for ages but because i couldnt see the change....
[18:00:23] <sine0> why on earth is the page not updating, the logo image changes!
[18:01:06] <pavonia> In the image you showed earlier there was another property set which apparently gives different image sources for different image dimensions. Perhaps some JS code is changing the image according to this property, not the src?
[18:01:45] <pavonia> I've seen this on other sites too, but not sure what it it used for exactly
[18:03:09] <sine0> https://snag.gy/8gwrME.jpg
[18:03:36] <pavonia> Tohuw: Have you tried $("#my_input").prop("placeholder")?
[18:03:58] <sine0> srcset is the origionals
[18:05:13] <pavonia> sine0: Try removing this srcset and see if the image changes
[18:05:29] <Tohuw> pavonia Thanks! That seems to contain the value of the placeholder. However, I've come to realize that isn't the root of my problem: resetting a form via JavaScript doesn't revert it to such a state where the placeholder text is displayed. Does anyone know how to do this?
[18:06:16] <sine0> pavonia: how could i do this, its part of wordpress images
[18:06:58] <pavonia> .attr("srcset", "")
[18:09:53] <pavonia> Tohuw: Various SX answers suggest to use .focus().blur() on the elment after setting it's value to empty
[18:09:53] <StrangeCompany> I'm trying to use $.getJSON to run a request on the Twitch.tv API, but I keep getting a strange error I'm not familiar with. "append was called on object that does not implement interface Headers" Anyone familiar with this jquery.Deferred exception?
[18:11:24] <Tohuw> pavonia Thanks focus.blur() did the trick!
[18:13:08] <sine0> pavonia: thanks dude it worked!
[18:17:02] <pavonia> Ah nice. I guess the "correct" way is to not remove the property, though, but to replace it with a proper, recalculated one for the new image
[18:18:50] <pavonia> But then I don't know how Wordpress handles images with different dimensions, so .. meh :)
[18:34:06] <Evidlo> why is it that I can't access element.value for an <a> tag?
[18:34:52] <Evidlo>                                 <li><a href="#" id="stabilize" value="STABILIZE">Stabilize</a></li>
[18:34:58] <Evidlo> oops
[18:35:46] <Evidlo> anyway, I've got the element, but element.value is undefined
