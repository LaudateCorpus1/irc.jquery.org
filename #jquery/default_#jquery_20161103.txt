[01:16:29] <Utils> If you're retrieving json with $.get, and the response is {}, should it call the callback or no?
[01:16:42] <Utils> doesn't seem as if it doesn't, but I'd like it to
[01:29:00] <strull> your double negation is confusing me
[02:07:17] <Cork> Utils: what content is in the response doesn't matter
[02:07:29] <Cork> Utils: what matters is if the response is a http 2xx or 4xx or 5xx
[02:07:51] <Cork> Utils: what also matters is if the content-type from the server is Content-Type: application/json
[02:08:52] <Cork> (hmm, sorry the content has to be valid json.... but yes {} is valid json so it should call .done)
[03:06:27] <Chulbul> Can I ask queries related to pjax
[03:06:29] <Chulbul> https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax/issues/331
[03:06:35] <Chulbul> https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues/8702
[03:06:40] <Chulbul> dealing with this same issue
[03:09:04] <Cork> Chulbul: what is the actual question?
[03:09:43] <Chulbul> Cork: I'm getting this error:  jQuery(...).yiiActiveForm is not a function
[03:10:01] <Chulbul> but when I comment obj.scripts = findAll(obj.contents, 'script[src]').remove() from jquery.pjax.js, there is no error
[03:10:03] <Chulbul> Cork:
[03:10:09] <Cork> then you have to make sure you load the plugin that loads yiiActiveForm
[03:11:08] <Chulbul> Cork: ok
[03:11:54] <Chulbul> Cork: its loaded at first time, but when clicked on any button to load html in div container, how does it go away. It should remain there, as page is not loading at all.
[03:12:01] <Chulbul> Why it's expecting it load again.
[03:12:18] <Chulbul> ohk, so it's actually removing : obj.scripts = findAll(obj.contents, 'script[src]').remove()
[03:12:19] <Chulbul> right
[03:12:20] <Chulbul> Cork:
[03:12:44] <Chulbul> And if it's removing then I need to reload it.
[03:12:49] <Cork> Chulbul: you're probably loading jquery again and overwriting the original jquery object
[03:12:59] <Cork> and there by losing all the old jquery plugins
[03:13:19] <Chulbul> ok
[03:13:29] <Cork> (so the solution is to NOT load jquery again)
[03:13:54] <Chulbul> I checked the soruce, html inside firebug, jquery is only loaded for 1 time.
[03:13:57] <Chulbul> Cork:
[03:14:20] <Cork> Chulbul: though. note i have never used pjax, i'm only telling you what the errors means and possible causes
[03:14:36] <Cork> Chulbul: check the html you inject in the page
[03:14:47] <Chulbul> Cork: ohk.
[03:17:51] <Chulbul> Cork: you were right, the other page html was again calling pjax. I had to remove it from there. Thanks
[05:32:08] <kanzie> Im using .ajax() to parse a xml response but keep getting parseerror because they are sending some “ as text value in one element. is there a way for me to run a .replace() on the response before it is parsed?
[05:39:16] <jarlath> In the mobile view of my site, the little arrow beside "Retreats" expands the menu, while clicking on "Retreats" itself doesn't. I've tried using the same classes to hopefully attach the same behaviour but it just makes a mess of the menu. How do I achieve this? optimumhealth.ie
[05:50:15] <Cork> kanzie: you would have to add a custom transformer i think it is called
[05:50:16] <Cork> one min
[05:50:56] <kanzie> yeah Im playing aruond with dataFilter now
[05:51:06] <kanzie> but for some reason two other calls fail when I add it
[05:51:28] <Cork> there
[05:51:29] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[05:51:38] <Cork> haven't used this in ages >_<
[05:51:49] <Cork> opps wrong directly
[05:52:24] <Cork> hmm have they removed it...
[05:52:49] <kanzie> Cork: I need to parse the response before handed off tothe internal parser, this function parses the request before being sent
[05:52:58] <Cork> ya, i know
[05:53:16] <Cork> ah
[05:53:25] <Cork> kanzie: check the examples at the END of http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxTransport/
[05:53:39] <Cork> you want to replace "text xml": jQuery.parseXML with a custom function
[05:54:33] <kanzie> Best case would be to just runa function on it first so I can strip the illegal chars and then have it parse it as it does now
[05:54:50] <Cork> that is exactly what you can do there
[05:54:59] <kanzie> maybe I can use converter and run a local function and then call jQuery.parseXML
[05:55:09] <Cork> function(data) { return jQuery.parseXML(data.replace()) }
[06:00:36] <kanzie> Cork: ok, this could work… I just need to figure out how to write a regexp to remove all “ from anything between <Message>…</Message>
[06:00:39] <kanzie> any idea?
[06:01:16] <Cork> .replace('“', '') should work
[06:01:35] <kanzie> nah, that will remove them in the first line which is the xml-definition and I need them there
[06:01:53] <Cork> it should be " there not “
[06:02:08] <Cork> alternatively .replace('“', '"')
[06:03:42] <kanzie> Cork: Here’s the line I need to fix
[06:03:44] <kanzie> http://pastie.org/private/xbpo0vb3r6tfxzsregvnpg
[06:04:20] <Cork> i don't see anything invalid with that one
[06:04:32] <Cork> prob wouldn't do encoding="windows-1252", but...
[06:04:46] <kanzie> it sends the jQuery.parseXML() in to a fit
[06:04:57] <kanzie> cant modify what the servers sends me
[06:05:01] <kanzie> it is what it is
[06:08:46] <Cork> interesting
[06:08:58] <Cork> ran it through https://www.xmlvalidation.com/
[06:09:14] <kanzie> yeah I did the same
[06:09:49] <kanzie> but all I took from that was, just get rid of the “ and everybody will sing and dance :-)
[06:10:39] <Cork> no it isn't the problem
[06:10:57] <Cork> .replace('&', '&amp;') will fix it
[06:11:06] <Cork> though it needs to be more specific...
[06:11:19] <Cork> best would be if the server fixed there encoding
[06:12:10] <Cork> you could do .replace('Pumps&', 'Pumps&amp;')
[06:12:19] <Cork> that should be specific enough not to break things
[06:12:25] <kanzie> I dont think so
[06:12:28] <kanzie> check this out
[06:12:38] <kanzie> http://pastie.org/private/ph5qves1pyvobzj8gm4r1q
[06:12:52] <kanzie> this one also doesnt pass validation
[06:13:04] <Cork> it does
[06:13:06] <Nickneim> Hi guys, I have a conceptional (i.e. thinking) problem: Let's assume I receive JSON content from another server and store it as a promise. That's all fine. But after I store it as a variable I want to be able to use it without thinking about it being a promise or not. How can I do this in an object oriented environment e.g. store the promise as a property?
[06:13:44] <Nickneim> because when I access that property later, I might get "undefined" as value. Which if course is not the idea.
[06:14:02] <Cork> kanzie: https://jsfiddle.net/4p90p7ax/
[06:15:20] <kanzie> cork: but is that how the response is formatted? like a array?
[06:15:37] <Cork> kanzie: notice the .join('\n') at the end
[06:15:48] <Cork> it just builds a string in a more readable way
[06:16:23] <kanzie> nice
[06:16:30] <kanzie> ok Ill try to throw the replace in
[06:16:31] <kanzie> one sec
[06:18:45] <Cork> kanzie: and if that works i would quite strongly recommend sending a bug report to the one providing the xml
[06:18:46] <Cork> so they can fix it correctly
[06:19:28] <kanzie> Cork: indeed… I don’t know if I would want them to send entities in text though. Wonder if this could be fixed by changing the encoding instead?
[06:19:57] <Cork> no, and the spec requires it
[06:20:04] <Cork> that is why it fails the validation
[06:31:03] <kanzie> Cork: thanks for your help
[06:31:14] <Cork> np
[06:39:12] <renny3> is there a way via jquery to change/inherit ID attributes from another ID?
[06:41:50] <Cork> interit?
[06:42:04] <Cork> you mean base the id on another id plus something?
[06:42:08] <joaocastanho> Hi. I have an own made popup and I want to when they click outside it closes
[06:42:17] <joaocastanho> something with onblur="closePopup()"
[06:42:20] <renny3> let me give an example
[06:43:28] <Cork> joaocastanho: never ever use event attributes
[06:43:32] <Cork> use event listeners instead
[06:43:36] <renny3> I have #id1 { background: red;} and #id2 {background: blue;}. I want to keep using #id1 in my code but I just want to overide properties in #id1 with those in #id2
[06:43:41] <joaocastanho> why cork?
[06:43:53] <renny3> at Cork
[06:44:23] <Cork> joaocastanho: cause 1. you are mixing content and actions, 2. it breaks event listeners, 3. it can't have more then one
[06:44:31] <Cork> joaocastanho: and so on
[06:45:18] <joaocastanho> oh I tried with onclick="openPopup()" onblur="closePopup()" on same element
[06:45:21] <renny3> any ideas?
[06:45:42] <Cork> blur is for text focus
[06:45:46] <Cork> it can't help you here
[06:45:59] <joaocastanho> hm
[06:46:16] <Cork> was on the phone so had to be a bit short
[06:46:28] <renny3> Ultimately I want the change in ID to happen for 1 second, like a blinking effect
[06:46:31] <Cork> joaocastanho: what you need to do is when the dialog is opened bind an event handler on $(document)
[06:46:47] <Cork> joaocastanho: this event handler needs to check if the click event comes from inside the dialog, and if it does ignore it
[06:46:57] <Cork> and in all other cases close the dialog and remove it self
[06:48:29] <joaocastanho> I do know now
[06:48:31] <renny3> Just to be clear, I want to click a button and see it glow for 1 second.
[06:50:04] <Cork> renny3: what you want is a class
[06:50:04] <Cork> though remember that ids are more specific then classes so you can't override the background with just a class
[06:50:04] <Cork> (unless you set all the colors with classes)
[06:50:08] <renny3> nevermind, i figured it out
[06:50:10] <Cork> so you either need #id1.state2 { background-color: blue }
[06:50:19] <Cork> or to use two classes
[06:51:15] <renny3> ok thanks
[06:59:49] <TheDude> hi to all
[07:01:13] <TheDude> when I show a spinner loader I do this to prevent any click on the background:  $('body').off('click').click(function(e){e.preventDefault();});
[07:02:06] <TheDude> but how to enable again all? (this on spinner hiding)
[07:02:41] <Cork> you can't
[07:02:49] <Cork> i would recommend putting an overlay on the page instead
[07:03:45] <Cork> TheDude: the problem is .off() will kill all the old handlers
[07:03:53] <Cork> and there isn't any way to restore them later
[07:03:58] <TheDude> mmh ook
[07:04:21] <TheDude> I did now an overlay
[07:04:58] <TheDude> another thing, is there a way to disable the srcoll?
[07:05:00] <TheDude> *scroll
[07:05:10] <Cork> just make the overlay position fixed
[07:05:11] <rndUser2> Can anyone help me complete an image mouseover/mouseout event? https://jsfiddle.net/h57cwohu/2/
[07:05:35] <TheDude> aaaah ok, I'll try it now
[07:05:49] <renny3> ok, I'm using css active. How can I switch active off when pressing a button?
[07:06:03] <Cork> css active?
[07:06:09] <Cork> or do you mean a class?
[07:06:12] <cannap> :target
[07:06:16] <Cork> you can't
[07:06:25] <Cork> :target isn't controllable by js
[07:06:27] <renny3> yes, for example #ID1:active {whatever};
[07:06:31] <cannap> ah
[07:06:34] <cannap> he talks about jquery
[07:06:40] <cannap> i throught i was in css xD
[07:06:41] <TheDude> no, not work. thebackground scroll anyway
[07:07:04] <Cork> TheDude: ya, but should't matter if you put the throbber in the overlay
[07:07:34] <renny3> I have ID1 and ID1:active in my css. I want to click a button but I want Jquery depending on a condition to invoke active or not
[07:07:50] <TheDude> Cork: throbber?
[07:08:42] <Cork> you can't really do that
[07:08:42] <Cork> TheDude: the spinner or what ever you called it
[07:08:58] <Cork> TheDude: you can bind the scroll event and from there prevent the default scroll action
[07:09:04] <rndUser2> Anyone help my complete image hover mouseover mouseout event? https://jsfiddle.net/h57cwohu/3/
[07:09:06] <Cork> TheDude: but that won't fully prevent scrilling
[07:09:13] <TheDude> ah ok
[07:09:14] <renny3> anyone?
[07:09:33] <Cork> renny3: psudo classes can't be controlled by js
[07:09:49] <renny3> hmm, that's anooying. Is there a workaround?
[07:11:13] <Cork> like i said; use a class
[07:11:54] <TheDude> Cork: the fact is that I find terribly annoying that the page can move when you are executing an operation XD (both from pc to smartphone)
[07:12:09] <Cork> O_o
[07:12:23] <Cork> TheDude: well you can always use sync ajax and freeze the browser :/
[07:17:55] <renny3> Cork: the anooying this is I have to change all id's to classes
[07:18:11] <Cork> renny3: not really
[07:18:24] <renny3> how so?
[07:18:25] <Cork> you need to split id for targeting and id for styling
[07:18:37] <Cork> to id for targeting and class for styling
[07:19:06] <Cork> but ya, it is often better to use classes and dom relation for targeting too
[07:19:11] <Cork> that way you can reuse code
[07:19:22] <renny3> if only there was addID
[07:19:32] <Cork> add id?
[07:19:34] <renny3> ok
[07:19:37] <Cork> what would it do?
[07:19:44] <Cork> you can't have more then one id on an element
[07:19:50] <renny3> something similar to addClass
[07:20:00] <Cork> except the result would be invalid
[07:20:06] <Cork> as you can only have one id on an element
[07:56:38] <rndUser> Why is that when I reload my webpage all the images are of original size? https://jsfiddle.net/h794ar0L/
[07:57:40] <rndUser> instead of my defined css height and width for each image?
[08:01:12] <Tennis> rndUser i'm not sure but set the html attributes width and height
[08:01:12] <Tennis> it isnt occuring until after the hover
[08:01:12] <rndUser> on my webpage whenever the page is refreshed the images are of original size before mouseover
[08:01:12] <Tennis> https://jsfiddle.net/MajorTennis/jwunn9e9/
[08:01:12] <rndUser> but i try your advice to set html height/width
[08:01:33] <Tennis> yeah just set in the html <img height=250 width=350 src="etc...
[08:03:00] <rndUser> yeah, works fine now thanks a bunch Tennis
[08:03:14] <Tennis> you even just do all of that with html and css
[08:03:48] <Tennis> no probs , best of luck
[08:34:42] <Soheil> this chat room ?!
[08:34:47] <Soheil> cool
[08:43:34] <Caspan> i am using the following command to go and get me all check boxes that are checked
[08:43:36] <Caspan> return $('tr[name="IDs"]:checked').map(function () {return this.value;}).get().join(",");
[08:43:49] <Caspan> i was curious i am now storing my value in a TR tag
[08:44:02] <Caspan> i am using data-value="33443"
[08:44:37] <Caspan> how would i rewrite this to capture the values of any TR tag that has a class of selected?
[08:45:53] <Cork> Caspan: $.map($('tr.selected'), function(elm) { return $(this).attr('data-value'); });
[08:47:21] <Caspan> ahh
[08:47:29] <Caspan> Cork: thank you
[08:47:49] <Caspan> is there a reason you use th efunction elm?
[08:47:56] <Caspan> or is that jsut random
[08:48:10] <Cork> Caspan: $().map is for working with dom elements
[08:48:19] <Caspan> ok
[08:48:24] <Cork> i turned it around to $.map($(), function() {})
[08:48:39] <Cork> as it returns a clean array instead of a jquery object (less wasted objects)
[08:48:40] <Caspan> yeah i noticed that you put that first
[08:48:49] <Caspan> okay
[08:48:56] <Cork> mattias@ilait.seHUx5Ex82YAKI
[08:49:01] <Cork> woops
[08:49:17] <AdamPDotty> tstsk
[08:49:20] * AdamPDotty copies pwd
[08:49:41] <AdamPDotty> Why not $(this).data('value') ?
[08:50:00] <Cork> AdamPDotty: cause that copies the value into the $._data object
[08:50:11] <Cork> if it isn't already there it's wasteful
[08:50:33] <AdamPDotty> Ah, I thought it would generally be put there.
[08:51:10] <Cork> only when requested
[08:53:25] <Caspan> Cork: Its not returning anything
[08:53:40] <Cork> BAH
[08:53:48] <Cork> $(this) => $(elm)
[08:53:48] <Caspan> there are multipal calsses on the object
[08:53:50] <Cork> sorry about that
[08:54:13] <Cork> i often make that mistake
[08:54:26] <Caspan> you jerk!!
[08:54:28] <Caspan> ;)
[08:54:58] <Caspan> there we go
[08:55:00] <Caspan> thank you
[08:55:01] <Caspan> !!
[09:00:43] <mar77i> derp.
[09:01:04] <mar77i> I have this list of divs here I find through $('.main').children()
[09:01:45] <mar77i> var mydivs = $('.main').children();
[09:02:08] <mar77i> so I make some visible, $(mydivs[14]).css("display", "block")
[09:03:14] <mar77i> how can I avoid making grandchildren invisible? apparently, this didn't work: feed.find(":visible").css("display", "none")
[09:05:43] <Cork> mar77i: best is to use a class and from there control what the next level does
[09:05:48] <AdamPDotty> first: why not mydivs.eq(14).show();
[09:06:07] <Cork> .visible { display: block; } .visible > * { display: none; }
[09:06:17] <AdamPDotty> yes, second .addClass('hidden')
[09:07:01] <AdamPDotty> or here .removeClass()
[09:07:04] <mar77i> Cork: what would make $(".main > div") into $(".main > div:visible") ?
[09:18:08] <sigdk> any explanation why the map doesn't load properly here: https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/5/   ?
[09:18:31] <sigdk> note: if I resize the window, it does appear
[09:30:24] <FilipNortic__> sigdk: maight be some render comand that is missing... that get run on resize
[09:31:53] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, I tried to render it after the modal is shown... https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/9/  still nothing
[09:34:39] <verax5> Would anyone have any idea? I'm invoking this, it's suppose to return either true or false but returns undefined? http://laravel.io/bin/xKG4N
[09:41:56] <FilipNortic__> verax5: start debugging
[09:42:07] <verax5> lol?
[09:44:17] <FilipNortic__> well since it returns undefined it usally means that the scope is worng or that something is starange with invokation, debugger statments is usally the easiest way to tell what get run or not
[09:45:52] <verax5> what're debugger statements filip?
[09:46:04] <verax5> oh console?
[09:46:49] <verax5> Well I'm invoking it like this: userExists       = this.userAlreadyExists(); and it returns undefined
[09:46:58] <verax5> then in second statement I get normal message as expected
[09:47:08] <mar77i> 56/33 is quite a sexy number. :)
[09:47:38] <mar77i> wrong channel, though :S
[09:49:31] <FilipNortic__> verax5: set debugger statments or breakpoint in the cosnole and you should see what's going on alternativly set console.log to see that "this" refers to what you had in mind
[09:51:17] <verax5> hmm i see
[09:51:27] <verax5> i have a feeling it has to do with ajax call
[09:53:26] <verax5> anyone else here?
[10:11:48] <taplar> verax5: are you saying the return from that then is not passing the return value into the next then() ?
[10:12:11] <verax5> Hm im not sure taplap
[10:12:17] <taplar> userExists       = this.userAlreadyExists(); and it returns undefined <-- your doing an ajax call.  it doesn't work like that
[10:12:21] <verax5> i just learned u cant use return statements inside ajax
[10:12:26] <taplar> lol, right
[10:12:30] <taplar> your async man
[10:12:39] <verax5> well shit
[10:12:43] <verax5> i didnt even know what
[10:12:54] <taplar> that's why there are callbacks and promises
[10:13:16] <verax5> so i can use callback function and use return?
[10:13:39] <taplar> in your callback methods you can pass into other methods the data that you get inside that callback
[10:13:40] <taplar> or
[10:13:50] <FilipNortic__> yeah there were i got confued saw a then() in there but that's angulars ajax function or something like taht right
[10:13:57] <taplar> if you have a then() that returns a value, a following then() *should* get that value as an input
[10:15:25] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[10:15:43] <FilipNortic__> but he'
[10:16:07] <FilipNortic__> but he's using angularjs and not jquery here or am I way off?
[10:16:19] <verax5> im using vue resource library
[10:16:23] <verax5> https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-resource/blob/master/docs/http.md
[10:16:35] <taplar> i'd assume they should be similar.  ajax is ajax and a promise is a promise
[10:17:42] <taplar> i would be highly surprised if angular made their ajax calls able to return values, as that would mean they would be making their calls not async
[10:17:53] <taplar> or something
[10:18:25] <FilipNortic__> no but the then function could be something different
[10:18:39] <taplar> ?
[10:19:34] <verax5> right now im storing a true value in a variable
[10:19:39] <verax5> then checking it elsewhere
[10:19:45] <verax5> and continuing with other code
[10:20:08] <FilipNortic__> or is .then() native js I'm having a hard time keeping track somtimes?
[10:20:08] <taplar> if there is the chance that the following code that needs that value set can run before that ajax finishes, your going to have issues
[10:20:21] <taplar> then() is a promise method
[10:20:40] <taplar> which is a native function, but libraries can have their own then() which under the covers uses the base then()
[10:22:02] <FilipNortic__> right so thoreticly someone could make a really starange then method in a framkework just to mess with people
[10:22:10] <taplar> "The $http API is based on the deferred/promise APIs exposed by the $q service. While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide"
[10:22:11] <taplar> so i'd assume they go by the whole promise/a++ standard or whatever it's called
[10:22:30] <taplar> sure, but then you yell at them and use another framework, :)
[10:23:40] <taplar> but any who, if this is angular it would be more accurate for it to be asked in their room
[10:24:29] <FilipNortic__> agreed but i really use anyting but jQuery or native js so i can never keep track of what there are standards for and where the real diferences lie
[10:25:36] <taplar> ah.  well until 3.x jQuery wasn't a++ compliant but now it should be
[10:25:50] <taplar> they had a blog post or something about it
[10:26:27] <verax5> i might actually drop this shitty vue ajax library
[10:26:32] <verax5> and use jquery ajax methods iunstead
[10:26:35] <verax5> instead*
[10:26:44] <taplar> i thought you were doing angular?
[10:28:46] <verax5> taplar i rage quit angular
[10:28:56] <taplar> lol
[10:29:03] <henk_> lol
[10:29:08] <verax5> like week ago
[10:29:12] <verax5> its fken hard
[10:29:33] <taplar> don't tell me that!  i'm going to start doing some in shop soon
[10:29:33] <verax5> went to angular room everyones licking it but its fken hard when i tried it
[10:30:03] <verax5> but sure u can pick easy its prolly just hard for me
[10:30:08] <verax5> vue i find easy as heck tho
[10:30:25] <verax5> only using it cuz of templating and 2 way binding
[10:30:39] <taplar> ah
[10:31:33] <verax5> but its somewhat new so not many people are expert at it or willing to help
[10:33:08] <verax5> someone like u would pick in few days i say
[10:33:31] <ExeciN> when exactly does the callback of  $(document).ready gets called?
[10:33:49] <taplar> maybe, who knows.  i do have the benifit of being paired with a uxer who knows it
[10:33:49] <taplar> ExeciN: once the document is loaded into the DOM
[10:34:05] <taplar> but before all the resources (ex. images) are retrieved
[10:34:41] <taplar> in the best case.  there was one version of IE that doc ready didn't work with and it would fall back to load
[10:35:58] <verax5> 48 lines of code in server file and 208 in client.. lol cant believe im doing so much shit in js
[10:36:22] <verax5> i used to do every single thing in laravel
[10:37:35] <ExeciN> I'm populating a <select> with <option>s using $(document).ready and it takes a while for the select to start getting filled. I'm wondering if there is a way to start populating it earlier
[10:38:13] <taplar> quickest way would be to put the script immediately after the select in the body, and don't use a doc ready
[10:39:06] <ExeciN> I have my scripts on the bottom of <body> would it make any difference if I move them on my <head>?
[10:39:22] <taplar> though how are you loading it?  are you getting the values with ajax?
[10:39:28] <taplar> if your script is at the bottom of body you don't need the doc ready.  you do if the script is in the head
[10:39:46] <ExeciN> yes, ajax
[10:39:54] <taplar> do the values change over time?
[10:40:09] <ExeciN> they are cached, cache expires after a week
[10:40:18] <ExeciN> (cached server-side)
[10:40:24] <taplar> after a week do they change?
[10:40:42] <ExeciN> Highly unlikely
[10:41:00] <taplar> cause you're going to get a delay while your ajax is executing
[10:41:11] <taplar> i'm just more curious as to if they are not changing, why get them with ajax
[10:41:24] <taplar> why not load them on the page as it comes back from the server
[10:41:54] <ExeciN> I could log something before ajax to see when it starts
[10:42:14] <ExeciN> maybe its early enough and ajax takes some time
[10:43:36] <taplar> *shrug*  you can profile that or see it in your network tab
[10:43:37] <taplar> it may be a small amount of time, especially if your allowing caching client side (which you should be) but it still has to do the work so time will be spent obviously
[10:46:16] <Utils> Cork: are you around? I just woke up and seen your messages. I can confirm that it is indeed a 200 status code, and the response is {}, you can even visit the url to see. I'm also using jsonp, not sure if that makes any difference.
[10:49:44] <the_french_> Hi there ! Any recent change on code.jquery.com ? I have one site which is using hotlink onto code.jquery.com that suddenly changed of look !
[10:50:11] <taplar> do what?
[10:50:21] <taplar> you were linking to files on code.jquery.com?
[10:50:51] <the_french_> yes, such https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.2/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[10:50:57] <taplar> dude...
[10:51:03] <taplar> code.jquery.com isn't a cdn
[10:51:10] <the_french_> It look like it was not a great idea :D
[10:51:24] <the_french_> This is clearly the opportunity to change it !
[10:51:31] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
[10:52:35] <the_french_> Thank you I'll fix this now :) Hope this will solve the trouble !
[10:52:50] <ExeciN> caching client side? got any inputs on that? do I save my data in a cookie?
[10:54:23] <taplar> probably available on maxcdn too
[10:54:24] <taplar> it should definately be more stable
[10:54:25] <taplar> ExeciN: no i mean your browser should cache resources automatically if you allow it to
[10:54:25] <taplar> do this, hit F12 to open your developer tools and go to the network tab
[10:54:25] <taplar> go to your page and refresh
[10:54:25] <taplar> see if the files are returning with a 200 or a 304
[10:54:25] <taplar> or 301 i forget
[10:54:49] <MikeD_> 301/302 are redirects
[10:54:57] <taplar> sweet
[11:00:04] <Utils> Cork, I solved it. I didn't realise JSON and JSONP were that different. I used JSONP as a solution for an access-control-allow-origin header issue but I had the the genius idea of setting the header on the url I'm requesting. oopsies
[11:01:08] <ExeciN> yeah I'm fetching jquery and bootstrap from a cdn, that isn't a problem, what I thought was to cache the data I'm fetching with ajax
[11:05:54] <ExeciN> I mean instead of fetching the data again, have it cached locally
[11:21:15] <the_french_> @taplar : I moved to google CDN, problem is elsewhere and code.jquery.com should be as stable as google. I'm still looking for the solution.
[11:21:51] <the_french_> even with a valid backup I reproduce the problem :-/ !
[11:23:17] <taplar> you still shouldn't be using code.jquery.com as a cdn
[11:24:59] <the_french_> @taplar, sure, I moved to google CDN :)
[11:27:20] <the_french_> @taplar : looks like something was previously broken on code.jquery.com, the jquery ui css was not loaded properly, and suddenly it worked again
[11:29:50] <the_french_> @taplar : I removed the jquery ui css and now my template is working as before
[11:30:10] <the_french_> @taplar thank you for your help
[11:30:18] * the_french_ is going to leave
[11:32:27] <relipse> hi
[11:39:56] <jak2000> taplar hi how are you
[11:39:56] <taplar> pretty good.  work stuff is picking up so sorta lurking now
[11:43:11] <jak2000> :)
[11:43:40] <jak2000> any advice: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rde14feo/   how to start? the user need move into text fields with key up, key down, key left and key rigth how to do this trick?
[11:46:00] <taplar> probably start with the up and down, left and right will be slightly tricky
[11:46:58] <jak2000> yes i can detect
[11:47:06] <jak2000> but. detect and how to move?
[11:47:25] <taplar> my thoughts are they'd have a shared class
[11:48:11] <ajpiano> i don't think they need a class
[11:48:12] <taplar> and you'd navigate off of the index of the collection of those
[11:48:23] <ajpiano> i am taking a crack at this because i want to see if i can solve in less than 10m
[11:48:26] <taplar> you kinda want to avoid positional logic as much as possible
[11:49:07] <sigdk> what is $("#myform").reset();   supposed to do?  I dynamically populate a <select> element every time my form pops up. The problem is that the <option>s appear multiple times afte the first open... .reset() doesn't help
[11:49:46] <sigdk> may I try to empty all elements individually>
[11:49:47] <sigdk> ?
[11:51:11] <jak2000> taplar: ajpiano: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rde14feo/2/
[11:51:11] <jak2000> sigdk: reload() ?
[11:52:29] <sigdk> jak2000, ? I want to empty the <option> fields. I'm wondering if I should do it manually or there is a method to call upon form
[11:53:02] <taplar> empty() the select
[11:53:15] <sigdk> to clean up everything... I guess soon, I'll need to clean up more things. i.e. validation sings
[11:54:47] <sigdk> taplar, isn't there a way to reset the form as initially defined when loaded? before any js code run
[11:55:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset
[11:55:31] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't sound like what you want entirely.
[11:55:31] <taplar> reset() on the form
[11:55:31] <robertmaxrees> that just resets the values.
[11:55:31] <taplar> talked about that yesterday
[11:55:31] <jak2000> taplar, robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rde14feo/4/
[11:55:45] <ajpiano> i have a neater version of that in the works jak2000
[11:56:14] <jak2000> if i type something on the input text, and i keydown the left arrow it move to the input not in the text :(
[11:56:25] <jak2000> ajpiano please see: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rde14feo/4/
[11:57:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to call reset on the underlying dom element, not the jquery object fwiw.
[11:58:10] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: if i type something on the input text, and i keydown the left arrow it move to the input not in the text :(   https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rde14feo/4/ any advice?
[11:58:39] <robertmaxrees> change your code?
[11:58:49] <robertmaxrees> your code says that's what you want it to do.
[12:00:01] <robertmaxrees> so maybe clarify what you're expecting.
[12:00:11] <FilipNortic__> sigdk: sound like you want a something that rembers the complete dom-state of a form on pageload and set it to that when called. There isn't you either have to save a copy somewhere or reload it true ajax.
[12:01:39] <jak2000> how to prevent if i want move under the text?
[12:01:39] <jak2000> if i keydown left arrow move next control only if i am on start of the text
[12:01:39] <shayla> Hi guys, i'm getting an element doing something like : $( "li" ).get(0). Now how can i use a functio  like "attr" on that element? Thanks
[12:01:54] <decx> get gives you the node
[12:01:56] <decx> use eq
[12:02:00] <ajpiano> jak2000 https://jsfiddle.net/rde14feo/5/
[12:02:09] <ajpiano> that works ^^
[12:02:29] <ajpiano> you gotta preventDefault on the event if its an arrow key so they don't do their normal behaviour
[12:02:43] <ajpiano> only took 2 minutes longer than i expected, hooray, i still know js
[12:02:47] <robertmaxrees> haha.
[12:03:48] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, thanks
[12:04:40] <shayla> decx:  Thanks decx
[12:05:41] <jak2000> ajpiano checking
[12:07:23] <jak2000> ajpiano
[12:10:46] <ajpiano> mmhmm
[12:11:09] <taplar> shayla: use eq() instead of get()
[12:11:09] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/rde14feo/6/
[12:11:09] <jak2000> test pls
[12:11:09] <jak2000> write some text in the input 2,2
[12:11:13] <jak2000> and key down the left arrow
[12:11:15] <jak2000> what happend
[12:11:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:11:34] <jak2000> checking
[12:11:39] <jak2000> why move the control
[12:12:20] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to check the index of the cursor
[12:12:23] <ajpiano> huh?
[12:12:30] <ajpiano> ah
[12:12:45] <ajpiano> didn't realise that was a necessary thing
[12:12:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah - he doesn't want the cursor to move to the next field unless it's at the beggining/end of the current field.
[12:12:55] <ajpiano> oh should be simple enough
[12:13:16] <taplar> iirc it's like selectionStart

[12:19:37] <ajpiano> <3
[12:19:47] <henk-_> why find caret?
[12:20:09] <henk-_> i thought you wanted dropdown.open to be found?
[12:20:17] <skypce> ahh this is a span element that show me the glyphicon
[12:20:34] <skypce> it is like <i>

[12:40:53] <kanzie> has anyone attempted at switching from a ant-build system to webpack on a large webproject? Something I should attempt or just avoid for the sake of sanity
[12:43:51] <verax5> Cant figure something out
[12:43:54] <verax5> would someone help
[12:44:33] <taplar> gotta ask for us to help, :)
[12:44:45] <taplar> ask the question, that is
[12:54:15] <sigdk> what does this do: $('#myform')[0].reset();  ?   what's the purpose of [0] ?
[13:03:36] <verax5> sigdk first element
[13:03:50] <sigdk> verax5, the first element of the form?
[13:04:24] <verax5> yeah i'd imagine but normally when u use array with selector u are targeting first element
[13:04:40] <verax5> $('p')[0] would return first p
[13:05:30] <skypce> hey
[13:05:37] <skypce> why this code did not work?http://pastebin.com/xwxnf6Cx plasse
[13:06:41] <verax5> tried consoling it?
[13:06:50] <verax5> @tablar I have this: http://laravel.io/bin/9vP9G
[13:07:29] <verax5> @taplar and I have this function thats causing problems. http://laravel.io/bin/DeL2x
[13:07:39] <verax5> It wont return true or false
[13:14:10] <taplar> then(function(){ /* logic */ return true; }).then(function(input){ //input should be true });

[13:16:45] <verax5> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[13:16:51] <taplar> :)
[13:17:17] <verax5> i swer lol. vue resource shits confusing syntax confused me
[13:17:48] <verax5> look at that shit: https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-resource
[13:18:09] <taplar> es6
[13:18:26] <taplar> not vue
[13:18:27] <verax5> inside then theyt put this weird function => {} shit
[13:18:31] <verax5> :O
[13:18:35] <taplar> that's es6
[13:18:36] <verax5> isnt ecma js?
[13:18:44] <taplar> yes
[13:18:53] <taplar> it's not specific to vue
[13:19:14] <verax5> but still strange?
[13:19:18] <verax5> u see this bit:
[13:19:18] <taplar> () => {} is the same as function() {} but it doesn't change the scope of 'this'
[13:19:19] <verax5> then((response) => {
[13:19:29] <verax5> ohh
[13:19:58] <taplar> http://es6-features.org/#Constants
[13:21:15] <verax5> I dont get this man?
[13:21:21] <verax5> thought ecma was deads
[13:21:24] <verax5> ded
[13:21:28] <taplar> lol, no
[13:21:38] <verax5> I used to read about it in history books
[13:21:43] <taplar> ecma is that standard that js is built on
[13:22:23] <taplar> current wide adoption is ES5.  ES6 support is slowly growing
[13:24:03] <verax5> hmm
[13:24:12] <verax5> so everything that exists in ecma exists in js?
[13:24:23] <taplar> uh, i can't claim that
[13:24:42] <taplar> i'm not *that* familiar with the standard, :)
[13:25:03] <taplar> and there isn't just one js
[13:25:16] <taplar> there's ff's implementation, there's chrome implementation, etc.
[13:25:23] <verax5> yeah
[13:25:25] <verax5> well shit
[13:30:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2kcbzf0s/
[13:35:00] <sigdk> any idea how to reset the map div?
[13:35:01] <sigdk> https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/13/
[13:35:34] <taplar> what part do you want to reset?
[13:35:42] <sigdk> if I close the modal window and then reopen it
[13:35:50] <sigdk> the map apears two times
[13:36:13] <sigdk> so, open modal, close and reopen to see the problem
[13:37:11] <taplar> you are createing a new map every time
[13:40:21] <sigdk> taplar, well, that might change indeed. but can't I just clear the div?
[13:40:27] <sigdk> and yes, create the map every time
[13:40:35] <taplar> so don't create it every time...
[13:40:46] <taplar> don't fix a problem your making for yourself
[13:40:51] <taplar> don't cause the problem in the first place
[13:41:50] <taplar> stick the whole thing in an IIFE, store the map in a var in the IIFE.  create the map if it doesn't exist, otherwise, don't
[13:42:00] <sigdk> taplar, I 'll use the same form form a) creating a user, 2) updating existing info for a user   In the later case the map needs to be initialized differently... so I thought I 'd recreate things every time... and keep everything in the context of my event
[13:42:30] <taplar> you're reusing the same modal for multiple things?
[13:42:38] <sigdk> taplar, yes
[13:42:41] <taplar> egh
[13:42:58] <taplar> whatevs, then do $('#map').empty(); before you create the new one
[13:43:03] <sigdk> I thought it's okay... there are like 10 fields...
[13:43:22] <taplar> you're making more work for yourself, really.
[13:43:31] <taplar> but *shrug*.  outside looking in
[13:46:52] <sigdk> taplar, why am I making more work... I thought the opposite
[13:47:17] <taplar> you're saying your reusing a modal for different things
[13:47:19] <sigdk> the only problem might be that this is "ineficient" cause I'd have to create a map every time instead of updating it
[13:47:40] <taplar> which means you have to clean it up and change it to what it should be for the different things.  rather than just having separate modals for each piece
[13:48:01] <taplar> also the bind on trigger should be moved out of that event handler
[13:48:05] <taplar> your binding multiple times
[13:48:55] <taplar> well you would be, but it's not working.  trigger isn't a tagName
[13:50:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/14/ <-- open your console, open/close the modal a few times, then click that trigger button
[13:52:23] <sigdk> taplar, I'll pull the trigger outside the function
[13:52:51] <sigdk> 2 modals --> 2 forms, meaning x2 code (?)
[13:53:12] <taplar> x2 markup
[13:53:13] <taplar> but potentially less code
[13:53:16] <sigdk> I'm using 1 modal & form and based on button, I update only what changes
[13:53:24] <taplar> the concept of modularization isn't just a back end concept
[13:54:23] <sigdk> taplar, if it was OOP, I'd have a class and two different sublcasses
[13:54:42] <sigdk> you say I'd rather create two different classes and duplicate the functionality
[13:54:51] <taplar> no
[13:55:04] <taplar> if you have two use cases for modals, you'd have a modal for each
[13:55:17] <taplar> each having defined, clear, logic
[13:55:24] <taplar> not intermingling
[13:55:39] <sigdk> taplar, I really had some thought on it, and so far I thought this is the right way to go
[13:56:49] <sigdk> imagine I have 1 form for registering a user... like 10 fields, all need to be validated.  And then I have another form for updating a user (essentially I populate all data doing an ajax request when poping up the form)
[13:57:22] <taplar> both those operations potentially have the same modal
[13:57:23] <sigdk> isn't it better to just use the same form ?
[13:57:36] <taplar> but that's not what you said before, from my understanding
[13:57:47] <sigdk> same moddal == same form
[13:57:49] <sigdk> no?
[13:57:54] <taplar> my understanding was this case of the modal you have the map, but another case you might have something else as the content of the modal
[13:58:12] <sigdk> no, sorry if I didn't explain properly
[13:58:21] <sigdk> it will be a map as well but with a different focus
[13:58:44] <sigdk> but you have a point, I 'll try to pull the map out
[13:58:54] <sigdk> and just update the focus instead of re-creating it every time
[13:58:58] <taplar> ok, so always a map, different location focus
[13:58:59] <taplar> yeah i was going to say if that is the case you should check the api
[13:59:04] <taplar> there should be a way to adjust the lat-long
[13:59:21] <sigdk> I just thought it's better to constrain everything within the scope of the events
[13:59:27] <sigdk> and make it stateless
[13:59:35] <taplar> but it has state
[13:59:38] <taplar> the dom, :)
[13:59:56] <sigdk> yeah... I'll change it
[14:00:16] <sigdk> taplar, or think about this... in terms of efficiency
[14:00:36] <sigdk> I create a map, even though the user might not click on the button
[14:00:38] <taplar> destroying/creating elements < efficiency < updating elements
[14:00:45] <sigdk> I thought it's better to do it lazily...
[14:01:07] <taplar> create it once, update it often
[14:01:13] <sigdk> okay
[14:01:23] <taplar> there are libraries out there with the whole intent of minimizing the interactions with the dom
[14:01:27] <arc_> okay, a long time ago someone in here mentioned a tool and i forgot what it was called. basically it was some kind of templating engine that generated static html pages so you could have dynamic functionality without all the trouble that comes with it. anybody have any idea?
[14:01:46] <taplar> handlebars/moustache maybe
[14:02:05] <arc_> neither of those. the only other thing i remember is that the site for it was maroon and dark grey :p
[14:02:22] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:02:36] <ajpiano> http://jekyllrb.com/
[14:02:39] <taplar> generates static html pages where?
[14:02:47] <arc_> that's it, thanks ajpiano :)
[14:03:07] <ajpiano> it sounded lilke you were describing a static site generator then the colors of the website gave it away
[14:03:12] <taplar> ah, is that like a md language?
[14:03:37] <ajpiano> jekyll supports templates in a few diff formats IIRC and can accept markdown or htmlk content
[14:03:50] <taplar> cool
[14:04:53] <sigdk> what's this?
[14:05:45] <arc_> sorry, it had nothing to do with your question if that's what you're thinking
[14:05:51] <taplar> heh
[14:06:14] <sigdk> I know that :)
[14:07:08] <arc_> okay ;)
[14:07:42] <arc_> basically it's a thing that lets you define what your site will look like, and what content you want to plug in where, and then you can just feed it text in markdown or whatever else and it will generate new static html pages
[14:08:17] <arc_> so for people who really know what they're doing it's not super helpful, but if you wanted to make a site for someone else who wants to be able to make posts and stuff without having a lot of technical knowledge, it would be good
[14:08:34] <arc_> or if you would just rather write posts in markdown than in html
[14:08:48] <taplar> database with blog entries of md content that get returned, :)
[14:09:16] <arc_> if that's a correction i don't really get what you're saying
[14:09:53] <taplar> me?  i was just offering a use case suggestion
[14:10:04] <arc_> oic
[14:13:23] <sigdk> okay...
[14:30:59] <taplar> sigdk: i got the center resetting https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/16/
[14:33:48] <sigdk> taplar, is map considered a global variable there?
[14:34:00] <taplar> it's local to the IIFE
[14:36:19] <sigdk> taplar, thanks

[14:49:30] <jquery684> Hello guys. I have an activity (getting the user IP) that needs to be done once. Now how would I store the IP so it is accessible for later use without having to deal with the promise? Here is my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/r5a45j4w/4/ Help is greatly appreciated :-)
[14:51:51] <jquery684> As you can see, the above is an asynchronous activity. But I don't want future reference to it to have to care about promise&done. How would you handle this?
[14:57:31] <Caspan> http://pastebin.com/pQiBZvtD
[14:57:31] <Caspan> i have this code that will let me add a class to a clicked on row
[14:57:31] <Caspan> its parent has to have a class of SelectableRows
[14:57:31] <Caspan> how do i make this some only rows clicked on that have a class
[14:57:46] <Caspan> sorry so only rows clicked on that have a calss of "clickMe"
[14:58:01] <Caspan> so if the row does not have this calls its not clickable
[14:58:14] <Caspan>  /call/class/
[15:01:43] <MassDebates> you add the class upon the triggering action Caspan
[15:03:02] <Caspan> MassDebates: OKay i think i figured it out
[15:03:17] <Caspan> .on('click', 'tr.clickable:not(.selected)', function () { $(this).addClass('selected'); } )
[15:03:39] <Caspan> only add the class selected to tr.clickable
[15:03:55] <Caspan> then when checking only remove it from tr.selectable
[15:04:02] <Caspan> that makes sense
[15:06:11] <jquery684> From the mighty jQuerykids' silence I humbly assume that storing of async requested data is a no go and one should force the ajax request to run sync(?)
[15:06:50] <Caspan> i was reading each statment in the reverse
[15:06:51] <MassDebates> Yeah I
[15:06:58] <MassDebates> Woops.
[15:07:44] <MassDebates> jquery684:  Why not store it in a variable?
[15:07:52] <MassDebates> jquery684:  are you going to be using it later in the script?
[15:10:44] <jquery684> @MassDebates: exactly, multiple times
[15:11:20] <MassDebates> Do you know how to use jquery?
[15:11:30] <jquery684> MassDebates: I tried that but when I call the variable, it sometimes does not hold the value, yet. Yes, I also have a fiddle:
[15:11:38] <jquery684> https://jsfiddle.net/r5a45j4w/4/
[15:11:53] <MassDebates> Are you familiar with scope?
[15:11:58] <segurb> hello
[15:12:39] <segurb> $('.tabs-tab[data-id="'+fileId+'"]') how slow is this selector? compared to $('.tabs-tab'+tabId), which one is preffered?
[15:13:10] <segurb> dynamic ids or class names are not my prefference since they just look ugly, however what is the performance of first idea?
[15:13:51] <jquery684> Yes, obviously it's bad practice to store the variable on a global scope so I'll create an object. The idea was to store the value as a property and work with object methods setting/getting it
[15:15:57] <jquery684> Anyway I can set the variable using promise but I cannot order the get methods to follow the same ruleset because there is no myProperty.done()
[15:16:19] <jquery684> so the get methods will usually result in "undefined" when accessing the property
[15:17:06] <MassDebates> Mitigating performance holdups is often achieved by chaining simpler pieces together in sequence (in terms of the selector)
[15:17:07] <MassDebates> If you're asking about the raw performance rate of an attribute selector vs a following sibling selector, the 2nd example is significantly lighter.
[15:17:07] <MassDebates> er, 'significantly' may not be applicable for you. Depends on project and what you're doing.
[15:17:32] * MassDebates twitches
[15:17:33] <taplar> the issue here is that promise methods do not 'return' values
[15:17:37] <MassDebates> ^
[15:18:07] <taplar> they return the promise upon which they are called upon
[15:18:14] <taplar> upon upon
[15:18:15] <taplar> :(
[15:18:19] <jquery512> I want to add Active class if date is today or not --> https://jsfiddle.net/wevjqqra/2/
[15:18:52] <taplar> you should consider taking a look at moment.js
[15:19:04] <MassDebates> or maybe the jquery api
[15:19:17] <taplar> Date() is relative to the users pc, which if you are concerned about accuracy you want something else
[15:19:21] <jquery512> I had moment.js, but that causes problems with Iphones
[15:19:45] <jquery512> https://jsfiddle.net/wevjqqra/4/
[15:19:45] <segurb> MassDebates: well I am making and extended ace editor, basically trying to make a small set of IDE tools with ace editor. So I need ALOT of selectors for example tabs, imagine you have a tab, you have tab selector for event on click to change that tab, but also in that tab div, there is close icon, so that one is another selector for event, but booth of this need to have same data-id value or something I can
[15:19:48] <segurb> refference the id of tab/file that was clicked
[15:19:51] <segurb> and I am not sure how do pull this off
[15:20:01] <jquery684> @taplar @MassDebates: it seems I'm not the only one having this issue: This gives an interesting perspective: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14220321/how-do-i-return-the-response-from-an-asynchronous-call
[15:20:23] <taplar> dude, we've told you, it's async.  you don't return from the promise functions
[15:20:28] <MassDebates> There's a lot of people who want to be able to inject HTML tags with CSS :after and :before pseudos, too.
[15:20:34] <taplar> you call whatever logic you need from within those functions
[15:20:41] <MassDebates> Google what "AJAX" means for starters.
[15:21:19] <segurb> MassDebates: check this out: https://0x0.st/2Hs.jpg how do they have no id data linked to their tabs?
[15:22:13] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[15:22:30] <jquery684> taplar, yes, you're right. But even if I use a callback I won't be able to store the result in a variable that can be accessed and hold the values I want for later use, for sure. It could always be "undefined"
[15:22:46] <MassDebates> what am i looking at segurb
[15:22:58] <taplar> 'when' do you want that logic to happen?
[15:23:47] <segurb> MassDebates: the tabs, you see Tab1 and Tab2, they have events for switch and close, so they must be having javascript events on them, but there are none, how do they do this?
[15:24:01] <segurb> besides, it is ibviouse elemtsn have no identification do them at all
[15:24:06] <segurb> yet they work
[15:24:20] <segurb> how do I transfer data to events without having it in html?
[15:24:33] <MassDebates> jquery512:  For the record, I use PHP to pull IPs.
[15:24:33] <taplar> if you know absolutely that you will finish the ajax call before you will be calling the logic that uses it, then yes you can store it in a more global variable
[15:24:33] <taplar> otherwise, you'll want to attach the function call to the promise in then() or done()
[15:24:33] <MassDebates> oh, okay, i'll look now segurb
[15:24:36] <segurb> how do they bind their events?
[15:25:12] <segurb> MassDebates: sry I was wrong, you can see they have ::afters, but whats the point of after if they got no identification of a tab?
[15:25:25] <segurb> do they find out its index, and then use the index to control the tabs?
[15:26:00] <MassDebates> segurb:  Er, well, before I jump in there, there's many ways to select an element.
[15:26:00] <MassDebates> segurb:  looking now.
[15:26:05] <MassDebates> I don't know. I can't touch it.
[15:27:25] <MassDebates> I only really do basic questions and problems that are only supported by a single image like that.
[15:27:25] <MassDebates> Okay, I made an account
[15:27:27] <segurb> its very interesting, I dont get how they do that
[15:27:45] <segurb> so just go to File->create new files, atleast 2
[15:28:18] <segurb> and write in each one something, then switch the tabs, and try to explain me how they knew which tab to refference in js code if there is no any id in html sources of those tabs ro tab close?
[15:28:21] <MassDebates> I did.
[15:28:21] <MassDebates> I don't see what's so mysterious here.
[15:28:21] <MassDebates> They have tons of ways to select these tabs.
[15:29:43] <MassDebates> segurb:  And that's not how it works
[15:32:08] <hcker2000> any one know a good way to pass a node between two on('click' events
[15:33:48] <hcker2000> http://jsbin.com/sejixoqixa/edit?html,js,output
[15:34:39] <hcker2000> in that second on click I need to know which .btn-extension node was clicked so I can remove it
[15:37:33] <taplar> extract the method from the second handler and have it accept the element in the parameters
[15:40:24] <taplar> e.target
[15:40:24] <taplar> pass in e to your eventHandler
[15:40:24] <taplar> or wait, i'm confused
[15:40:36] <taplar> that jsbin doesn't have any of your mark up.  are you expecting a click to trigger both of those callbacks?
[15:44:57] <segurb> MassDebates: what would be a good way to select those tabs?
[15:45:07] <segurb> how do they know which one is selected as well?
[15:45:29] <segurb> my code started to become a mess after I started injecting id's of files in all tabs and all editor elements ...
[15:46:37] <hcker2000> taplar, no
[15:46:44] <hcker2000> first button click opens a modal window
[15:46:53] <hcker2000> 2nd button click is the submit for the modal window
[15:47:15] <hcker2000> on 2nd button click modal window should hide and first button should hide
[15:48:38] <hcker2000> i could easily do it with a global variable but that sucks
[15:48:53] <hcker2000> the other option is to generate unique ids for each button each page load which is easy enough to do
[15:49:24] <hcker2000> just wondered if there was a better way to remember which first button was clicked as there will be many of them
[15:50:16] <verax5> have same class
[15:50:24] <MassDebates> hcker2000:  I think you're complicating the issue at hand.
[15:50:35] <MassDebates> hcker2000:  Why not use classes and swap out classes as appropriate?
[15:50:45] <hcker2000> MassDebates, possibly its late in the day
[15:51:01] <hcker2000> I could also generate a class and attatch it when the first button is clicked
[15:51:31] <ajpiano> store an element reference in .data()
[15:51:32] <ajpiano> not a s tring
[15:51:33] <ajpiano> then you can pull it back out
[15:51:40] <hcker2000> ajpiano, tried that
[15:51:53] <hcker2000> dosnt seem to like to store it with .data
[15:53:16] <hcker2000> perhaps i messed that up earlier so im going to try it again
[15:53:56] <hcker2000> ajpiano, i must have messed some thing up earlier as that worked just fine this time around
[15:54:13] <ajpiano> probably weren't referring to the same element or sommat
[15:55:29] <hcker2000> ajpiano, yea i think perhaps i had a selector wrong that i thought was correct.
[16:24:30] <jainayush975> hello
[16:24:35] <jainayush975> I am new
[16:24:48] <jainayush975> and want to contribute to community
[16:28:44] <verax5> anyone online?
[16:29:12] <taplar> jainayush975: give this a look http://contribute.jquery.org/
[16:29:21] <taplar> verax5: lurking
[16:29:28] <verax5> @taplat I put function in callback and returned true/false from there but still I get undfined : (
[16:29:44] <taplar> show me?
[16:30:42] <verax5> @taplar
[16:30:43] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/6LrNr
[16:31:10] <taplar> that looks like the original
[16:31:32] <verax5> I put function inside then
[16:31:58] <taplar> ok, so when you return from a then() it will be passed into following then() or done()
[16:32:54] <verax5> Hmm I dont quit understand man
[16:32:58] <verax5> is there something I should read?
[16:33:12] <taplar> i linked a learn.jquery.com/ajax thing earlier
[16:33:23] <taplar> you're operating within an async operation
[16:33:34] <taplar> this means it does not have a place to return to, traditionally
[16:33:45] <taplar> the logic will move past your call after it has been made
[16:34:01] <verax5>  O
[16:34:11] <taplar> as such, in order to do logic once the request has finished, you attach methods to it by then() or done() or such
[16:34:14] <taplar> which get invoked once it is done, whenever that may be
[16:36:02] <verax5> hmm
[16:36:03] <verax5> so I should..
[16:36:03] <verax5> hmm
[16:36:03] <verax5> well shit
[16:39:57] <taplar> it's definitely a different mind set you have to work in
[16:41:28] <taplar> pass the true or false into  a method that will actually use them
[16:41:35] <taplar> is one option
[16:42:00] <verax5> Can I set variable to true or false?
[16:42:11] <verax5> then at some other place check it
[16:42:29] <taplar> it's better to pass them, but yes you can set a more global variable, if you know 100% that the ajax will finish before that logic can execute
[16:45:10] <verax5> right now im converting the code to pain jquery ajax methods
[16:45:20] <verax5> so i can understand it better
[16:46:05] <verax5> vue resource plugin is just bad, unnecessary
[16:46:05] <verax5> i dont understand how some libraries try to shove in shit that can be done in pure jquery
[16:48:10] <taplar> vue's purpose is to build the interface
[16:48:11] <taplar> it's like react in that regard
[16:49:42] <verax5> hmm
[16:49:42] <verax5> but its as easy/hard as plain jquery lol?
[16:49:42] <taplar> it's different i'll tell you that
[16:49:45] <taplar> but i've been doing jquery a lot longer than the other two so there is some difference in knowledge base right now
[16:49:54] <taplar> so there's some biast, :)
[16:50:09] <verax5> lel
[16:50:17] <verax5> these guys seem like they changed method named
[16:50:26] <verax5> and boom there's new vue library called vue-resource
[16:50:33] <verax5> lel
[16:55:52] <verax5> but anyhow
[16:56:01] <verax5> taplar
[16:56:08] <verax5> how do i interact with zomething like this in console?
[16:56:08] <verax5> Object { userExists: 0 }
[16:56:23] <verax5> I tried Object.userExists
[16:56:30] <taplar> you can't from the console
[16:56:32] <taplar> as is
[16:59:25] <taplar> wherever you're logging that, put debugger; before it, have your console open and run the script
[16:59:26] <taplar> and whabam! http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:59:27] <verax5> damn
[16:59:27] <verax5> i wish there were so many cool ways to learn laravel and other framewoks lol
[16:59:27] <verax5> jquery community is sick
[16:59:27] <verax5> awesome
[16:59:27] <verax5> is that true ?? "And if you aren't using them, you are insane."
[16:59:40] <taplar> heh.  lets just say they are very helpful
[17:00:44] <plamb_> taplar how would you feel about answering a CSS question
[17:01:09] <taplar> teaching a man to fish type stuff
[17:01:09] <verax5> oh i thought he was talking about some library like drbuggers
[17:01:10] <taplar> slightly hesitant, heh.  i can venture an answer, but i'm not a guru
[17:01:49] <plamb_> pm'd you
[17:13:38] <verax5> yo what does breakpoint do?
[17:13:42] <verax5> just stop the script?
[17:13:51] <taplar> pauses
[17:14:47] <verax5> hmm is there any point in using it?
[17:15:06] <taplar> yep.  pausing your script lets you look at the variables in scope and see what they are
[17:15:32] <taplar> and you can also run commands from the console while it is paused and it will act as if the commands were ran from the scope that you have it paused in
[17:15:39] <taplar> that site talks all about it
[17:17:59] <verax5> : O
[17:19:50] <verax5> @tapla!!
[17:20:04] <verax5> I set async to false
[17:20:07] <verax5> and it worked omg
[17:20:08] <verax5> async : false,
[17:20:09] <taplar> don't do that
[17:20:12] <verax5> lol?
[17:20:34] <verax5> :wut:
[17:20:34] <taplar> async: false locks the entire browser while it runs
[17:20:34] <taplar> don't go counter to the paradigm
[17:20:43] <taplar> it's also been removed from the latest jQuery version
[17:20:51] <verax5> well shit..
[17:22:31] <taplar> seriously man, read that learn.jquery.com/ajax thing
[17:25:27] <verax5> I wanna read it all
[17:25:30] <verax5> but its so long..
[17:25:38] <verax5> I read it half
[17:27:16] <snover> if you can’t tolerate reading that small amount of text, you may want to consider an alternative hobby/career
[17:27:33] <verax5> I'm attempting this approach
[17:27:33] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/Lkbre
[17:27:34] <verax5> Okay mr. snover.
[17:27:36] <verax5> Thanks for your advice.
[17:28:14] <taplar> this.userExistsResponse = true; <-- 'this' is probably not what you think it is right there
[17:30:31] <verax5> taplar I userExistsResponse variable initiaize above it
[17:30:45] <verax5> So when I get data I assign true
[17:30:53] <taplar> that's not what i'm saying
[17:31:10] <taplar> 'this' is a special argument with javascript that changes based on scope
[17:31:18] <taplar> have you verified that it is what you think it is?
[17:36:26] <verax5> omggg..
[17:36:35] <verax5> its not changing variables value
[17:36:45] <verax5> Ive set those variables at the top in data method
[17:37:00] <verax5> all those variables are available globally
[17:37:18] <taplar> are you still doing the 'this.' ?
[17:38:47] <verax5> im actually using this everywhere
[17:38:47] <verax5> thats how vue guys have
[17:38:53] <verax5> they set alll variables in data {} object
[17:38:56] <taplar> did you verify that 'this' is what you think it is, like i suggested?
[17:39:05] <verax5> how do i verify taplar?
[17:39:11] <taplar> *sigh*
[17:39:11] <verax5> console.log(this) ?
[17:39:14] <verax5> lol
[17:39:16] <taplar> sure, or debug
[17:39:31] <taplar> if your not going to listen to suggestions, i'm gonna stop trying man, :|
[17:46:16] <verax5> Any particular section of docs to read?
[17:46:16] <taplar> for what?
[17:46:17] <verax5> you said about suggestions
[17:46:17] <verax5> which part of ajax doc should i read
[17:46:17] <taplar> no, i suggested that you make sure that 'this' was the object you thought it was.  and you said you had not done that
[17:47:16] <verax5> I actually dont know how to do that, i consoled the this and it returned set of objects
[17:48:15] <taplar> you can console it and it will show up in your console and you can click it and it should show the details.  or you can put "debugger;" right before it to make the debugger pause there and you can look around
[17:48:26] <taplar> which is explained in that fixingthesejquery site
[17:48:58] <verax5> yeah im slowly going through that sites slides i have it open
[17:49:03] <verax5> and i can see im able to refer to this.userExistsResponse taplar
[17:49:17] <verax5> it does show the value when i console that
[17:49:33] <taplar> not the value
[17:49:33] <taplar> 'this'
[17:49:57] <taplar> your expecting that your attaching the userExistingResponse to some object
[17:50:04] <taplar> and your expecting that the 'this' is that object
[17:50:06] <taplar> verify that
[17:53:01] <verax5> hmm taplar
[17:53:04] <verax5> im using vue
[17:53:05] <verax5> one sec
[17:56:36] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/wJWPx
[17:56:37] <verax5> line 39 returns empty value despite me changing it in userAlreadyExists method
[17:56:37] <taplar> dude, seriously
[17:56:37] <verax5> :(
[17:56:37] <taplar> what is 'this' in that success callback?
[17:58:19] <sillyslux> `window`
[17:58:30] <sillyslux> *lucky guess
[17:59:01] <sillyslux> so this.userExistsResponse === window.userExistsResponse
[17:59:02] <taplar> *shrug* i don't know.  i forget if the success callback changes the scope to the callback function or not.  it needs to be verified though
[17:59:04] <sillyslux> is it?
[17:59:31] <sillyslux> hm, so i don't know too
[18:00:53] <taplar> the drawbacks of using this, :D
[18:04:08] <verax5> sillysux how did you check that
[18:04:18] <sillyslux> did i?
[18:04:33] <verax5> im in console ive ive added breakpoint to this inside callback
[18:04:36] <verax5> how do i know the scope and shit
[18:05:21] <taplar> inside the success function, console.log(this) and see what it prints out
[18:06:54] <verax5> im there taplat
[18:07:01] <verax5> i see bunch of object inside Object
[18:07:07] <verax5> which one to check
[18:07:08] <taplar> click the outer Object
[18:07:15] <verax5> done
[18:07:16] <taplar> it should expand it on the RHS
[18:08:15] <sillyslux> what's rhs?
[18:08:39] <sillyslux> remote homicide syndrome?
[18:08:49] <taplar> so is it the object you thought it was?
[18:08:49] <verax5> tapla it has lots of properties, I clicked on Object
[18:08:49] <verax5> global
[18:08:49] <taplar> and, is it what you thought it was?
[18:08:49] <taplar> right hand side
[18:08:50] <taplar> heh
[18:08:58] <verax5> well fk
[18:09:26] <verax5> it has lots of properties, idk what to look for?
[18:09:37] <taplar> you were assuming it was your data object, no?
[18:10:30] <verax5> yeah i thought when I did: this.PropertyFromDataObject it woulod return that property
[18:10:39] <taplar> so is it your data object?
[18:11:33] <verax5> How would I know if it's data object? would Object returned by console.log(this) have name 'data'?
[18:12:55] <taplar> you know what your data object looks like
[18:12:56] <taplar> you have it defined above with keys and crap
[18:12:56] <taplar> does it look like that?
[18:12:56] <taplar> heh, it's not a trick quesiton
[18:12:56] <verax5> well it doesnt looks like my data object
[18:12:56] <verax5> looks something else
[18:12:56] <taplar> ok
[18:12:56] <verax5> means i cant even fken access it from success?!
[18:12:56] <verax5> OMGFGFDSG¬!!!!!!!!!!
[18:12:56] <taplar> *sigh*
[18:12:56] <taplar> it just means 'this' is not the data object
[18:13:13] <taplar> $.ajax() in the callback methods changes the scope so 'this' is different
[18:13:32] <taplar> so you just have to reference whatever it was before, or whatever you want to access, differently than using 'this'
[18:14:16] <sillyslux> you can work around with var that = this; and then use that.userExistsResponse
[18:14:40] <taplar> assuming that 'this' is the data object outside of the ajax, ^
[18:14:42] <verax5> omg wtf.. i could have tried echoing this.property inside sucesss callback i would have figured this out
[18:14:48] <verax5> omfgggggggggggggggggg
[18:14:50] <verax5> im ded
[18:15:00] <verax5> fk fk fk
[18:15:16] <taplar> heh, are you starting to see how important debugging is? ;)
[18:15:51] <sillyslux> yeah learn browser debugging, that will save so much time and nerves
[18:15:53] <verax5> yeah i am but im also starting to see how difficult js is :(
[18:16:13] <sillyslux> you haven't even scrached the surface
[18:16:31] <verax5> yeah silly its kinda an issue alot of stuff i learn then never use em and forget
[18:16:40] <verax5> i usualy code in laravel
[18:16:45] <verax5> trying vue these days
[18:16:48] <verax5> with js/jquery
[18:16:52] <verax5> for frontend
[18:17:03] <sillyslux> it's not difficult, but it has grown in to a big fat monster with 100 heads
[18:17:55] <verax5> :(
[18:18:09] <verax5> atleast there's people and rsources u can learn from
[18:18:19] <verax5> unlike laravel and vue
[18:18:24] <verax5> bunch of potatoes with ego
[18:18:39] <taplar> vue is fairly new, afaik.  so the support base might be smallish
[18:19:05] <taplar> idk if there is even a S.O. tag yet
[18:19:34] <taplar> there is, nice.  "vue.js"
[18:19:48] <taplar> 3,518 questions
[18:19:52] <taplar> heh
[18:20:00] <verax5> 3.5k
[18:20:00] <verax5> rip
[18:20:14] <sillyslux> if you want some small amount of backwards compatibility, that is, support for es5-only browsers, you either always use a transpiler like babel or you always check every line, every statement, if it wasn't by any chance es6
[18:20:16] <taplar> it's new, not dead, ;)
[18:20:30] <verax5> laravel community is full of potatoes too
[18:20:36] <verax5> i dont even ask in their channel no more
[18:20:41] <verax5> mainly try learning mysef
[18:21:06] <taplar> i've never really used any php frameworks.  usually hand roll things.  but i'm a hobbiest too
[18:21:15] <sillyslux> vue is the free-ish react?
[18:22:36] <taplar> react is free to
[18:22:37] <verax5> i never tried react
[18:22:37] <verax5> but im sure its good
[18:22:37] <verax5> heard abot it
[18:22:37] <taplar> i'd have to assume its more of a learning curve than vue
[18:22:37] <verax5> yeah
[18:22:37] <verax5> vue is easy
[18:22:38] <verax5> easiest framework i used so far
[18:22:38] <verax5> i mean library
[18:22:38] <verax5> or whatever
[18:22:42] <taplar> i love me some handlebars
[18:24:22] <sillyslux> with react you or your client can loose the licence
[18:24:31] <sillyslux> more or less easily
[18:24:44] <taplar> ?
[18:25:20] <sillyslux> google react license issue
[18:26:09] <sillyslux> thing is, you never know what you or your client will do tomorrow
[18:26:20] <verax5> btw yall interested in seo, online money kinda shit check out my forum http://seosatanforum.com :D
[18:26:23] <taplar> huh

[18:26:36] <verax5> they post that shit on twitter : )
[18:26:39] <verax5> le
[18:27:21] <taplar> i doubt that i'll creating something that will cause a lawsuit against FB, :|
[18:27:56] <taplar> but ya, that's dumb
[18:30:02] <taplar> might have to try vue then, :).  or just stick with my handlebars
[18:30:08] <verax5> so i cant even access variable in success callback, in the funciton
[18:30:17] <taplar> or w/e tf Mithril is
[18:31:07] <taplar> eh, that's a while mvc package, i don't need that
[18:31:28] <verax5> wat to do taplar
[18:32:00] <taplar> in regards to your issue?  did you see what sillyslux suggested?
[18:32:00] <taplar> brb

[18:42:32] <sillyslux> oh good night guys
[18:42:38] <taplar> l8r
[18:44:29] <verax5> help pls
[18:44:58] <verax5> http://laravel.io/bin/qQMXo
[18:45:16] <verax5> i cant access userExistsResponse variable even tho is exists inside that function
[18:46:15] <taplar> sure you can, but it's ajax.  it's async.  the console.log is happening before the ajax finishes
[18:49:10] <verax5> wow my brain hurts
[18:50:02] <emx> I have an issue with datepicker: The setting I use to format date gives me on jsfiddle the expected presentation of the picked date. When I use that setting in my app then the default format is used for presentation. I made sure that there is no other JS that would $().datepicker() that element. Any Ideas what the reason could be?
[18:51:05] <taplar> same exact code, same exact library versions?
[18:51:35] <verax5> taplar how can i access variable userExistsResponse outside current function? http://laravel.io/bin/qQMXo#
[18:51:58] <taplar> read the learn.jquery.com/ajax page man
[18:55:54] <verax5> omg
[18:56:00] <verax5> thought u had been linking me to api page
[18:56:00] <verax5> :(
[18:56:02] <verax5> shit
[18:57:32] <taplar> the api has the info too, but learn is a little more friendly
[18:58:07] <verax5> "The asynchronicity of Ajax catches many new jQuery users off guard."
[18:58:10] * verax5 hi
[19:01:36] <verax5> O kay
[19:01:39] <verax5> read it
[19:02:38] <taplar> yup, read all of it.  i'm out for the evening though.  catch all you peeps tomorrow
[19:03:00] <verax5> later man
[19:03:03] <verax5> thanks for helping
[19:03:10] <taplar> np, hope that page helps
[19:03:15] <verax5> yeah yeh
[19:03:17] <verax5> cheers
[19:03:20] <verax5> have a good one
[19:32:13] <ChrisBinge> I have content that loads in funky looking, so I want to hide the initial page load until it sorts itself out. I figured the `$(window).load` function would be the best place for that code, but it executes AFTER I can see content. http://pastebin.com/d3su5Wm3
[19:34:52] <roflmyeggo> is it possible to prevent/stop the capture chain?
[19:37:19] <Dan39> roflmyeggo: what is the capture chain?
[20:18:43] <voltorb> i'm making a quote generator
[20:18:45] <voltorb> my code right now is very weird
[20:18:48] <voltorb> i'm already using an api and i would like to know what the best way to replace text would be
[20:26:12] <verax5> anyone online?
[20:26:19] <verax5> need some help with ajax
[20:31:36] <Forbidd3_> I am trying to fix a specific div when the scrollTo hits the bottom of the div position, the issue  is there is content below the div and when scrolling past it toggles the class on and then back off because the page jumps
[21:44:35] <AntonioRibeiro> Is this supposed to work with any kind of string?: $('#message_container').empty().append(errors);
[21:45:49] <AntonioRibeiro> I'm generating an HTML with errors (bootstrap) and it does not work unless I manually parse the json in PHP, removing (") and ([]) from it
[21:49:51] <AntonioRibeiro> if I manually use the very same string generated it works:
[21:49:52] <AntonioRibeiro> $('#message_container').empty().append('<div class="alert alert-danger alert-dismissable" role="alert"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button><i class="fa fa-fw fa-warning"> </i>Email invalid</div>');
[21:50:12] <AntonioRibeiro> but not with the dinamically generated errors variable...
[22:15:43] <agrippaz> AntonioRibeiro, hmm i haven't seen so many commands strung together like that, where it empties before it fills. give it a go
[22:18:15] <AntonioRibeiro> agrippaz, you mean $('#message_container').empty().append(errors);
[22:18:16] <AntonioRibeiro> ?
[22:23:21] <Forbidd3_> Trying to fix div when bottom of div is reached, but there is content below it so it is accounting for that in content below
[22:55:32] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am using datatables.js and when I try to disable column sorting on more than one column it throws an error and breaks everything. Anyone mind taking a look? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/XNWpao
[23:01:07] <coldhead> d3m0n: could it be this line: "targets": [0, 3],
[23:01:28] <d3m0n> coldhead: It is exactly that line but it's correct code from the docs
[23:01:32] <coldhead> you have [0, 4] which would mean your table had 5 columns, and i think it only has 4: indexed 0 - 3
[23:02:08] <d3m0n> coldhead: ahh lemme check
[23:02:12] <coldhead> it doesn't yell at me when i change the 4 to a 3
[23:09:44] <d3m0n> ughh yeah youre totally right but my actual code still throws this eror
[23:09:55] * d3m0n scratches head.
[23:17:46] <Forbidd3_> What would I be missing - when the scrollHeight > height becomes true it works, but as the user tries to keep scrolling it stutters
[23:17:48] <Forbidd3_> http://pastebin.com/hVBgTEmx
[23:27:14] <Forbidd3_> this is a fiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/phkcg7e2/1/ - I am trying to get the footer to stay in relative place, but when the scroll get to the bottom of it, add the stickit class so it stays fixed and the content below it continues to scroll above it
