[02:37:13] <donnil> hi
[02:38:20] <Sendoushi> hey
[02:40:48] <donnil> I am looking for a jQuery based image slider that supports captions, thumbs and has something like the ken-burns effect. I don't need fancy transition, only fade is enough. Something like this, but free http://www.zoompanningeffectslider.com/index_zoom_generous.html
[02:41:19] <Sendoushi> i don't know much about plugins sorry
[02:41:34] <Sendoushi> i could just search some but that i think you can do ehehe
[02:44:21] <lo_o|> Sendoushi,
[02:44:30] <lo_o|> i have a wai beter slider dan dat
[02:44:41] <lo_o|> mine slides thums
[02:44:49] <lo_o|> continusly
[02:45:41] <Sendoushi> not the right target :P
[02:46:04] <lo_o|> and u can control slide direcion w mouse
[02:46:06] <lo_o|> haha
[02:46:16] <lo_o|> and haz captiong
[02:46:21] <lo_o|> and xml
[02:46:46] <lo_o|> and efects
[02:47:12] <lo_o|> like thum highlight
[02:47:17] <lo_o|> white flush
[02:52:53] <ravenzz> what the hell is wrong with this http://jsfiddle.net/AKfyk/ the context in success and error is not the plugin.prototype .. therefore this.done.apply and this.fail.apply don't work
[03:01:09] <ravenzz> anyone alive?
[03:02:12] <lo_o|> i died
[03:02:23] <lo_o|> 2 mins ago
[03:02:46] <lo_o|> stil dying a lil
[03:02:53] <ravenzz> that was a fast resurrection
[03:23:11] <donnil> lo_o|: what slider is that?
[03:24:35] <jop008> Someone time to fix a layout issue in 2 pages bad rendering on IE8/9 good in other browsers?
[03:26:29] <lo_o|> i wrote it
[03:26:42] <lo_o|> its mineeee
[03:33:46] <DelicateFlower> is there a method that would let me wrap a text in tags?
[03:35:06] <Jattenalle> DelicateFlower, '<tag>'+sometext+'</tag>' that what you mean?
[03:36:30] <DelicateFlower> yes
[03:39:56] <Jattenalle> DelicateFlower, i dont think there's anything like that, since it's simple enough to do with strings
[03:40:04] <Jattenalle> shouldnt be too hard to write your own function that does it though
[04:33:23] <ravenzz> mh is it possible to change the context for the ajax success method?
[04:35:30] <OnkelTem> What is canonical URL for including lasest jquery? Can I use http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js ?
[04:35:49] <OnkelTem> Or google/some cdn whould be better?
[04:37:02] <OnkelTem> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js - meant that
[04:45:23] <onenine90> hey guys - I am having an issue with jQuery UI resizable. I have a parent and child. The parent element has resizable applied. Aspect ratio is set to true. However, when I shrink it small enough, the width appears to get larger on the parent for some reason.. distorting the aspect ratio
[04:45:52] <onenine90> any ideas why?
[04:50:44] <doitux> Hi, i tried many countdown plugins to be displayed in a jqm popup. Unfortunately there are massive problems. Some of them doesnt start ... others count too fast ... Any ideas whats the problem?
[04:51:22] <Jattenalle> onenine90, have you set minWidth or minHeight?
[04:51:34] <onenine90> yes
[04:51:37] <onenine90> both
[04:51:42] <Jattenalle> are they set properly?
[04:51:50] <Jattenalle> i mean, do they match the aspect ratio
[04:54:24] <onenine90> no
[04:54:27] <onenine90> lol
[04:54:31] <onenine90> hmm
[04:55:03] <onenine90> I am passing a jQuery img dynamically created to the resizable function
[04:55:16] <onenine90> so it is not able to grab the height and width with $(img).height()
[04:55:21] <onenine90> or $(img).width()
[04:57:46] <onenine90> also, for some reason the parent element has some hidden padding
[04:57:56] <onenine90> browser shows no padding but there are 2 extra pixels
[04:58:01] <onenine90> gotta be throwing it off
[05:13:54] <dupondje> The function initialisePage() is something that is called automaticly by jQuery? Cant find docs about it directly.
[05:23:23] <|RicharD|> Hi, I'm doing an animation based on scrolling
[05:23:45] <|RicharD|> but with mbp(trackpad) is very very very fast
[05:24:08] <|RicharD|> so that I can't see the animation!
[05:24:21] <|RicharD|> with mouse instead is ok
[05:37:57] <onenine90> jquery ui resizable aspect ratio sucks
[05:38:00] <onenine90> doesn't work
[05:39:54] <bibi234> it's been a long time I haven't used jquery and there is something I forgot and can't find in the docs, when I attach an event handler (eg. on click), how can I retrieve information about the target?
[05:40:09] <velcrobots> using jqueryMobile to build an app - having trouble figuring out best way to have a popup (for an ad) only once per launch. Should I just use 'popup' inside a normal document.ready?
[05:40:47] <bibi234> oh I think it's $(this), nevermind
[05:52:54] <bibi234> inside an event handler, I can see $(e.target) and $(this) return the same thing, is there a recommended one?
[05:58:04] <Vivekananda> hey there everyone. If i use this method stackoverflow.com/questions/1200266/submit-a-form-using-jquery  for submit then will the form get submitted twice ? once from the page and once via juery ?
[06:18:15] <jop008> Someone time to fix a layout issue in 2 pages bad rendering on IE8/9 good in other browsers?
[06:19:00] <grafi> i dont even have ie8/9 ^^
[06:19:22] <jop008> but most people have this browser
[06:21:29] <jop008> This is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/125/
[06:22:05] <jop008> Not that difficult page
[06:26:55] <motaka2> hello how can I submit a form using jquery? $fom -> submitForm or something ?
[06:27:36] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/125/ is rendered like this in IE http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/125/
[06:27:55] <jop008> like this http://picpaste.com/ScreenShot-55OaPeZd.jpg
[06:28:49] <bibi234> why this code doesn't work? I'd like to grab the value from the text input when I click on the button, http://jsfiddle.net/qswJ8/
[06:35:03] <drager> Using .promise(), can I delay it somewhat after the animation is finished? Like 5 seconds?
[06:35:44] <drager> If that makes sense?
[06:39:24] <drager> Basically I want to do an animation, show some text then wait 5 seconds then run another animation
[06:44:12] <Tekla> drager: if you don't care about the exact delay you could delay the ajax response on server side :)
[06:45:51] <drager> Tekla: That I don't want to do ;<
[06:46:42] <bibi234> what's the problem here please, it's a very short code but I can't make it working : http://jsfiddle.net/qswJ8/2/ , I'm trying a lot of things since an hour I'm stucked...
[06:48:38] <drager> bibi234: What do you want to do?
[06:48:41] <Tekla> bibi234: i think it's parent()
[06:49:33] <drager> bibi234: Ah, you want to grab the value of the input?
[06:50:54] <Tekla> also ... the parent of the button is the div with data-role="controlgroup"
[06:51:02] <bibi234> drager: yes I'm trying to grab the input first, then I'll change the value
[06:52:27] <bibi234> drager: I think it's due to jquery mobile, it changes the dom because of the data-role and I can't make it anymore, without jquery mobile this code works
[06:53:13] * Tekla hides
[06:53:39] <drager> bibi234: Why doesn't you jsut grap the class?
[06:53:45] <drager> var a = $('input.test').val();
[06:54:58] <bibi234> drager: it's because this snippet is an extraction, on the real page there is a loop with a lot of those kind of buttons and input, so I have to find the way from the event target.
[06:55:08] <drager> I see
[06:59:34] <jop008> how to this in IE     var elm = document.createElement('input');     if (!isnull(elm.type)) {
[07:00:20] <jop008> I got message invalid argument
[07:00:25] <jop008> on type
[07:00:43] <jop008> isnull checks if type is not null
[07:04:23] <jop008> When I run IE8 in quricks mode no rendering problems
[07:04:42] <Vivekananda> how do I do an echo in jquery ?
[07:05:03] <drager> Vivekananda: How do you do an echo in javascript?
[07:05:31] <Vivekananda> drager: dont know :(
[07:05:41] <Vivekananda> printf and print I know
[07:05:53] <Vivekananda> but var_dump I am not sure if I can
[07:06:21] <drager> Vivekananda: That's server-side language specifc
[07:06:41] <drager> Vivekananda: To output to the console; console.log("MESSAGE");
[07:06:55] <drager> or rather PHP specific
[07:10:06] <Vivekananda> drager so if I have a jsonencoded object returned
[07:10:29] <Vivekananda> in data . can I do console.log(data); ?
[07:11:17] <drager> Try
[07:11:25] <jop008> My rendering goes bad in quircks mode in IE how to enforce non quircks mode?
[07:25:41] <jop008> I am using simpledialog2 popup for my alerts
[07:25:52] <jop008> works fine on most browsers but not on IE
[07:26:50] <madalin_> hello. Anyone noticed that $j('#keyword').val(''); is not working in firefox ?
[07:27:29] <jop008> a.mobile.activepage problem
[07:27:41] <jop008> is null or not an object
[07:28:22] <madalin_> Can anyone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/4Humm/ and tell me what i'm doing wrong ? I'm trying to reset an input value..
[07:28:49] <madalin_> (oh, the problem is .. its not working in firefox..
[07:29:38] <jcubic> madalin_: you run submit that do http request
[07:30:04] <madalin_> jcubic: so how can i make this work ?
[07:30:17] <jcubic> don't submit
[07:30:35] <madalin_> i need to submit..
[07:32:08] <jcubic> madalin_: what exactly you wanted to do here?
[07:32:48] <madalin_> jcubic: i am completing the value based on the input and i'm showing it to the user. I want it so that when he clicks it, to reset the input..
[07:32:54] <madalin_> and refresh the results
[07:34:11] <jcubic> you can test on init if queryString parameter test is empty
[07:37:47] <madalin_> jcubic: you lost me.
[07:42:03] <jcubic> madalin_: $(function() { var value = location.search.match(/test=(?:([^&]*)&|$)/); $('#test').val(value); })
[07:42:20] <jcubic> it will change the value of #test to that from query string
[07:42:34] <jcubic> but the input need to have name="test"
[07:43:17] <jcubic> but it will only work if you send data using get, if you use post then you need to do this on the server
[07:43:46] <madalin_> jcubic: thanks. But i actually fixed it.
[07:43:59] <madalin_> jcubic: i change .val('') to .attr('value', '');
[07:44:09] <madalin_> this seems to be a bug with firefox anyhow..
[07:44:47] <jcubic> but if you submit your data the value will not be stored
[07:47:38] <jop008> I have a libarary not working in IE how can I prevent it nicely for being loaded?
[07:48:05] <jop008> it is this line <script	src="./include/jquery.mobile.simpledialog2.min.js"></script>
[07:48:23] <jop008> So how to prevent it from loading when I am in IE browser
[07:50:15] <jop008> is this the way if ($.browser.msie) {      alert("this is ie!");  }
[07:50:17] <jcubic> jop008: there are conditional comments but it work in IE not no-IE
[07:50:38] <superlou> Is there any built in way to format a Date() object with jquery?  Without a plugin or additional library?
[07:50:45] <jop008> use the browser object?
[07:51:04] <jop008> with a document.write for the script ?
[07:51:11] <jcubic> jop008: you can load the library in javascript if (!$.browsr.msie) { $.getString('<FILE>'); }
[07:51:28] <jop008> okay
[07:52:07] <jcubic> superlou: you need to write a function using methods from Date object
[07:52:26] <superlou> jcubic, was afraid of that
[07:52:43] <superlou> seems like javascript's the only web language without some sort of time string formatting
[07:53:47] <jcubic> you can use the lib for that http://codegeekz.com/6-javascript-date-libraries-for-developers/
[07:54:53] <jop008> $.browser is null :-(
[07:55:18] <superlou> jcubic, yeah, there's bunches of those.  was hoping jQuery would prevent me from needing to roll my own
[07:55:19] <jcubic> jop008: it was removed in version 1.9 I think
[07:55:58] <jcubic> you can copy it from 1.8
[08:12:43] <jop008> So how to check for IE if browser is not there?
[08:16:26] <jcubic> jop008: You can take brower from jquery 1.8.3 it use regex to test UserAgent
[08:16:39] <jcubic> s/brower/browser
[08:18:07] <jop008> but I use jquery 1.9
[08:18:12] <jop008> can you mix it
[08:18:52] <jcubic> you need to copy just the browser from the source code, it's in it's own (function() { })()
[08:43:52] <xarcus> Hi there! I have some questions regarding jquery mobile. Can anyone help me?
[09:23:12] <jop008> how to avoid quircks mode in IE?
[09:48:44] <Velveeta> jop008: are you using a proper doctype?
[11:08:19] <Twiebie> Hi guys, In each div with ID group1, group2, group3, etc. (number increments) I want to show/hide an input field depending on a selected value. How would I accomplish this?
[11:08:21] <Twiebie> http://jsbin.com/dojut/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:08:35] <Twiebie> Do I .each through each group*?
[11:21:43] <Twiebie> Oh nevermind. Figured it out. :)
[11:28:46] <likemike_> Hello. How i can i work with SVG elements in jquery ?
[12:16:17] <Velveeta> likemike_: you can work with svg's the same way you do with any other part of the document
[12:33:29] <jbr> jQuery question: I'd like to initialize a plugin as items matching a selector come into existence. I believe $.live() is being deprecated, delegation with .on might work if there's a 'ready' event. What's the right approach?
[12:43:33] <sacho> you're looking for dom observers
[12:44:25] <sacho> they're kinda new technology though
[12:49:41] <jbr> gotcha. just delegated to the container's on click and just check to see if the plugin's initialized before doing it a second time..
[12:50:23] <sacho> that's probably a lot easier to do.
[12:50:26] <jbr> How does .on's delegation mode work anyway? I thought some form of dom observers. Or is it just a bubbling event and a filter?
[12:51:33] <Velveeta_> it's sort of a lookahead kind of method
[12:52:02] <Velveeta_> before exiting an element and bubbling up to the next, it checks to see if there are any parents that are listening on behalf of this element, and triggers the callbacks
[12:52:26] <Velveeta_> it used to work based off of bubbling, they changed it at one point
[12:52:58] <jbr> oh.. Is it more efficient than .live's timers?
[12:53:14] <Velveeta_> live didn't work on timers, it used bubbling also
[12:53:45] <Velveeta_> you'd feed it a selector to match against, and when an event bubbled up to the document, it would check the original target against those selectors, and fire callbacks for any that matched
[12:54:35] <Velveeta_> the change to doing lookaheads was to get around bubbling issues where one could kill the event bubbling between the child and the parent, and kill the callback from being triggered when it should have
[13:18:35] <imacinto> where can I find documentation for the JSON shorthand for appending elements? I don't even know what to search for. I'm talking like: $("body").append("<div>", { class: "foo" }); and all that
[13:24:23] <djuggler> Traversing problem.   <div class="container"><span class="bad"></span><span class="code"><input class="foo" type="checkbox"></div> When the checkbox is toggled, I want to change bad to good.  I'm going through each http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/ but failing. Can I get a shove in the right direction?
[13:24:26] <_rgn> imacinto: don't think it works like that.
[13:24:53] <drager> Can I hide an element when I focus an input?
[13:25:00] <_rgn> imacinto: $('body').append($('<div>', { class: 'foo' }));
[13:26:42] <imacinto> _rgn: oh neat. well… yeah, that, what's that called/where is it documented? how do I add words inside of the element?
[13:27:06] <djuggler> aha! I'm working with the wrong parent
[13:27:45] <_rgn> imacinto: here, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[13:28:26] <_rgn> $('<div>', { text: 'hello' });
[13:30:34] <basiclaser> hey can anyone tell me why this text resizing script isn't yet working? http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/2NUCr/
[13:31:04] <imacinto> _rgn: thank you, that's very helpful. I didn't know what to search for at all
[13:31:46] <imacinto> _rgn: so basically any property I specify for that element would be the same as doing $(whateverThatThingWas).property()?
[13:32:03] <_rgn> imacinto: $ is the function it's using, so "Core" in the docs is the right place to search
[13:32:29] <_rgn> imacinto: i think so
[13:32:44] <imacinto> _rgn: far out. thanks again
[13:33:02] <_rgn> you can do { attr: { type: 'text' } } etc.
[13:43:58] <Joost> I'm trying to get the i-th td in a tr element and change the html.. but find() seems to return an HTMLObject rather than a jQuery object..
[13:44:08] <Joost> It feels kind of weird to encapsulate it in $( ) again
[13:44:32] <Joost> I currently have 		$($(this).find('td')[i]).html('foo'), where $(this) is my tr
[13:50:20] <Velveeta_> use .eq(), or :eq in your selector string itself
[13:50:54] <Velveeta_> $(this).find('td:eq(' + i + ')').html('foo')
[13:51:05] <Velveeta_> ot $(this).find('td').eq(i).html('foo')
[14:27:50] <Argorok> When I have a (function($) { var foo = bar; function baz(xxx) { console.log(xxx); })(jQuery); in my page. The I can access the variable foo and function baz?
[14:28:03] <Argorok> How can I access*
[14:30:19] <Argorok> When I have a (function($) { var foo = bar; function baz(xxx) { console.log(xxx); })(jQuery); in my page. How can I access the variable foo and function baz? (Since its an unnamed function/object)
[14:33:41] <shoky> Argorok: you can't access them from outside that function, unless you store references to them somehow in an outer scope
[14:34:25] <shoky> (and it has nothing to do with the function being named or not
[14:34:26] <shoky> )
[14:34:33] <Argorok> shoky: even if I have the index of that function?
[14:34:36] <systemfault> Argorok: You could create your own "namespace" on the window object, pass it to the closure... and attach the functions/variable on it
[14:34:47] <shoky> what's an index of a function?
[14:35:26] <BillCriswell> Argorok: http://jsbin.com/lugud/1/edit might be useful
[14:35:30] <Argorok> shoky: the index o.0
[14:35:42] <shoky> there's no such thing
[14:36:28] <shoky> if there were, you'd be able to tell me what it was without making faces ;P
[14:36:29] <Argorok> shoky: Yes. It have. Break inside an anonymous function, look at call stack and you will see the function index :)
[14:36:43] <shoky> ugh
[14:36:45] <Argorok> BillCriswell: nothing to do with it, but thanks :D
[14:37:00] <Argorok> It has*
[14:37:48] <BillCriswell> Argorok: Really? Ok.
[14:38:09] <BillCriswell> Pretty sure I showed you exactly what you were going for lol.
[14:40:53] <BillCriswell> Ah well.
[14:45:08] <BillCriswell> Argorok: http://jsbin.com/lugud/2/edit here it is a little cleaner to understand.
[14:47:41] <BillCriswell> Err... probably not the best approach there.
[14:47:45] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[14:54:34] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/lugud/3/edit That's better.
[15:02:06] <Ericx2x> Can someone tell me how to get these arrows to line up properly with the tabs? I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.. http://jsfiddle.net/36Cj9/1/
[15:06:02] <ZeuZ> I've been wanting to do something akin of what MEGA.CO.NZ has done just for the laughs, I've managed to develop a PHP script that will return chunks of a file based on a number and now I'm looking at making a web interface for it
[15:06:56] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. a js jquery kind of question
[15:06:58] <Vivekananda> hey everyone I see a resulting url from ajax call but does not contain the ajax url : ...   why so ?  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9026428
[15:06:59] <ZeuZ> so that I don't have to send a downloader to the users
[15:07:20] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: You game to a different approach? Your HTML is making it difficult.
[15:07:43] <ZeuZ> how can I have a thread downloading while I've got another thread doing the UI on a per-event basis?
[15:07:51] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: I see a url:"" in there.
[15:09:28] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: I am hoping that my jquery will intercept the submit so I can manupulate stuff but is not happening
[15:09:41] <Vivekananda> why do you see url: blank ? isnt it there in the jqyer ?
[15:09:49] <Tomashe> hey guys . i got some issue with jquery mobile. i did an if statement when my page is loaded if (x==1) { $('[href="#login"]').click(); } everything is pass but the page isnt apearing
[15:09:54] <Tomashe> no errors
[15:10:11] <Tomashe> just showing the first page of my index.html
[15:11:26] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: Not sure I'm following.
[15:14:11] <Tomashe> fixed just neeeded ready()
[15:16:01] <Vivekananda> BillCriswell: box 1 has jquery which should intercept the form in box2 and process the sending request as get. But, on clicking submit the intercept does not happen as seem by the result  ( box 1 bottom ) . Question why is intercept not happening
[15:19:02] <shoky> Vivekananda: put a console.log  first thing in the submit handler, see if it's being called at all
[15:19:26] <shoky> is your code in $(document).ready handler?
[15:19:34] <Vivekananda> yes
[15:19:42] <Vivekananda> I put it later. Initially it was not :(
[15:20:12] <shoky> also what's that  response(...)  doing there
[15:21:02] <Vivekananda> shoky: I updated my gist to show it https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9026428
[15:21:07] <hooliogan132> hey... https://github.com/joelambert/Flux-Slider <-- no internet explorer love in 2 years ... which is understandable as no decent IE existed ... and I guess as the only Ie worth thinking about now would be 11 perhaps 10.. but it would be great to see that slider fly under M$
[15:21:11] <myndzi> is $.extend(true, obj) supposed to return a deep clone of obj?
[15:21:43] <myndzi> it seemed to do that when i tested in the console on the jquery site, but doesn't seem to do it in my app, so i'm not sure if it's actually part of the api and if it's old/new/removed/added or what
[15:22:05] <Vivekananda> shoky: I am just following the method I successfully used in a previous jquery
[15:22:31] <shoky> Vivekananda: to show what? you just added another different ajax there inside  an autocomplete. it doesn't explain why your first ajax has response in it
[15:22:50] <Ericx2x> BillCriswell what do you mean by different approach?
[15:22:51] <shoky> "response" is only something that exists inside the "source" callback
[15:26:10] <Vivekananda> shoky: I am confused. Are you saying the the word response on lin 37 is wrong ?
[15:26:21] <shoky> Vivekananda: yes
[15:26:48] <Vivekananda> ummm but I assumed that is how one processes the getrequest  after obtaining data
[15:27:06] <shoky> anyways make a jsfiddle showing your problem. as you can see your code works ok here  http://jsfiddle.net/ed6zy/1/
[15:27:16] <shoky> then you assumed wrong..
[15:27:22] <shoky> don't assume
[15:27:48] <shoky> you see how line 11  has:  function(request, response)    for the "source" option
[15:27:50] <Vivekananda> I say assume for this instance but based on a similar function I sued
[15:27:52] <shoky> that's where "response" comes from
[15:27:57] <shoky> it only exists in there
[15:28:07] <Vivekananda> oww shoot
[15:32:01] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: http://jsbin.com/tigik/1/edit?css,js,output here's some arrows.
[15:45:52] <hooliogan132> https://github.com/joelambert/Flux-Slider/blob/master/js/src/flux.browser.js <-- am I correct to think if at line 51/52 if i just add a null prefix & domprefix ..that should detect internet explore 11 yes?
[15:47:24] <ryanneufeld> hooliogan132: that's what the -m and Ms are for
[15:47:47] <ryanneufeld> adding a null prefix might even have un-expected results
[15:50:41] <hooliogan132> strange as later it trys to detect perspectiveproperty which i11 has aparently
[15:51:06] <ryanneufeld> hooliogan132: there are many ways to sniff a browser
[15:55:15] <hooliogan132> I believe some of the fuck up is at line 33
[15:59:49] <hooliogan132> hmm how can i conditionall include modernizr for ie then
[16:00:40] <hooliogan132> including modernizr that solves the problem in one foul swoup
[16:00:44] <hooliogan132> heheh
[16:01:23] <hooliogan132> 1 fouwl swooping gack hand to the jaw of interweb explioter
[16:02:20] <halvors> anyone need a team mate? mid here
[16:24:51] <Vivekananda> can someone tell me what is wrong in the second jquery in the fiddle. I am getting the first print out but not the second one http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/ed6zy/3/
[16:25:49] <shoky> Vivekananda look in your console
[16:27:07] <Vivekananda> the console does not gimme anerror . It prints hello world but not the second thing
[16:27:13] <Vivekananda> and just gives a css error
[16:27:23] <shoky> well there's an error in the top part
[16:27:27] <shoky> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[16:28:53] <shoky> Vivekananda: also, add an error handler to the ajax
[16:29:04] <shoky> probably you're getting a json parse error
[16:31:16] <ddod> I haven't had much luck googling this: How would I go about getting a sticky-sidebar type follower attached WITHIN a div, as in it's constrained to the width/height of a div within a page but will follow the scrolltop when it can?
[16:31:18] <krisek101> Hi. How can I change class of something class? $.(" .somethingclass ").changeclass
[16:32:10] <shoky> krisek101:  with .addClass and .removeClass and .toggleClass
[16:33:36] <krisek101> $(".somethingclass").removeClass().addClass("anotherclass"); I tried that and it doesn't work.
[16:34:35] <shoky> works fine for me
[16:34:44] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[16:35:53] <ddod> anyone have any tips or suggestions for my question above?
[16:37:55] <krisek101> http://jsfiddle.net/AnbyY/
[16:38:35] <krisek101> no
[16:38:44] <krisek101> i'm stupid
[16:39:22] <krisek101> it expresses nothing
[16:41:15] <shoky> if you want to look for multiple classes, use multiple dots, no spaces. e.g.  $('.tab-pane.fade.active.in')
[16:41:32] <shoky> but you don't need to use all of them, just one would be enough
[16:42:23] <shoky> and uh.. you can just do  .removeClass('active in')  instead of that whole chian
[16:42:25] <shoky> chain
[16:42:54] <krisek101> http://jsfiddle.net/AnbyY/1/
[16:43:15] <shoky> no, that's bad use of classes :\
[16:43:20] <shoky> they should be separate
[16:43:37] <krisek101> :o
[16:44:22] <shoky> anyway you have :  $('.tab-panefadeactive in')
[16:44:26] <krisek101> Yes, now it's work
[16:44:34] <krisek101> Thank you:)
[16:45:06] <Tomashe> money on my mind money on my mindddd
[16:45:22] <Tomashe> no money on my mind?
[16:45:24] <Tomashe> damn im borred
[16:45:47] <shoky> why no sleep?
[16:45:54] <motaka2> hello can anyone tell me why I do not get the add index in formData in this code?  https://gist.github.com/noondreams/9027528
[16:46:32] <Vivekananda> shoky: a sample  json is looking like this before parsing : https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9027538
[16:46:45] <shoky> motaka2  serializeArray doesn't give you an object, it gives you an array of objects. each object has "name" and "value" properties
[16:47:03] <motaka2> shoky: thx I got it
[16:47:52] <shoky> Vivekananda  ok and that's invalid json
[16:49:31] <shoky> Vivekananda oops sorry, that's valid
[16:51:05] <krisek101> shoky: In my code I can't separate the classes name becuse i use bootstrap framework
[16:51:19] <Vivekananda> that is the output right before I do echo json_encode($variable) ;
[16:51:39] <Vivekananda> and this is the Only echo / var_dump on the page
[16:51:43] <Vivekananda> for the .get
[16:51:56] <shoky> that's already json
[16:52:15] <shoky> anyway why are you checking the json, did you get a json parse error?
[16:53:09] <Vivekananda> no. my code runs fine till line 21 but does not go to line 28  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/ed6zy/4/
[16:53:19] <Vivekananda> so something is happenning between those lines
[16:53:31] <shoky> did you do what i told you to do
[16:53:35] <Vivekananda> Code is not even showing line 28
[16:53:55] <Vivekananda> you said to attach an error catcher but I don tknow where to do it
[16:54:01] <Vivekananda> I assume dyou meant for json
[16:54:10] <Vivekananda> but json appears to be correct
[16:54:18] <Tomashe> shoky, no sleep
[16:54:20] <systemfault> Vivekananda: .done == is only executed on success
[16:54:31] <Vivekananda> okay
[16:54:33] <systemfault> Add a .fail
[16:54:35] <shoky> Vivekananda then look in the docs for $.ajax to see how to add an error handler
[16:54:41] <Vivekananda> so let me see .fiail
[16:54:43] <Vivekananda> okay sure
[16:55:26] <shoky> Tomashe same here
[16:57:49] <Tomashe> :(
[17:01:02] <motaka2> shoky: how can I submit a form I built like $form = $("<form action='...' method='...'></form>");
[17:01:30] <shoky> motaka2 if you want to really submit the form (without ajax) then you need to add it to the DOM
[17:01:39] <shoky> and then .submit() it
[17:02:15] <motaka2> shoky: thx, I will apend it to body
[17:02:22] <Vivekananda> shoky: this is hilarious. I just put in a .done and .fail and suddenly the very same code is entering inside the done
[17:02:33] <Vivekananda> what the hell was wrong earlierI wonder
[17:02:36] <systemfault> Magic!
[17:04:19] <Vivekananda> systemfault: I am testing it in all wihch ways possible and someohw it is entering now
[17:04:35] <Vivekananda> i even removed the fail and still is working
[17:04:36] <systemfault> Added .fail shouldn't have changed anything.
[17:04:42] <systemfault> *Adding
[17:04:55] <Vivekananda> precisely!!
[17:05:01] <motaka2> shoky: Should it be done like this?  https://gist.github.com/noondreams/9027691
[17:05:05] <shoky> ya, you changed something else too
[17:05:13] <Vivekananda> shoky: nope
[17:05:30] <Vivekananda> let me post the current version along side the untampered previous one on fiddle
[17:05:44] <JuanDaugherty> is there some pkg that has client-side net functions like a name resolver?
[17:06:29] <shoky> motaka2: something like that, i guess.. why not just send it with ajax though
[17:06:43] <JuanDaugherty> or maybe just a xplatform  client lib
[17:07:21] <Vivekananda> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/ed6zy/5/  ( good thing I had the error one safely pasted )
[17:07:43] <motaka2> shoky: well an over all script submits them in ajax but now I try to make it work classical. But when I click submit I get nothing
[17:07:47] <shoky> Vivekananda: dont you understand that we dont see the error you're seeing when you post a fiddle like that..?
[17:07:50] <FriendlySeal> whoa gaize
[17:07:58] <FriendlySeal> im developing flash on linux
[17:08:07] <FriendlySeal> so crazy
[17:08:57] <Vivekananda> shoky: I do understand that but I merely saying that the only tihng I changed is the fiddle and I have put the older ( non working) and the newer (working ) version side by side . But anyways
[17:09:00] <Vivekananda> I am happy it works
[17:09:07] <Vivekananda> so onto a different question
[17:09:26] <shoky> if it didnt work before and it works now, then you changed something, period, don't argue.
[17:09:28] <FriendlySeal> watcant linux do? lol
[17:09:39] <FriendlySeal> i can do .NET on linux
[17:09:56] <FriendlySeal> lolololol
[17:10:03] <shoky> FriendlySeal stfu
[17:10:10] <Vivekananda> shoky: OR something changed but was not one of things that I changed. perhpas with apache orjson encode or time to reach or something
[17:10:22] <Vivekananda> nothing to argue
[17:10:23] <FriendlySeal> wats ur fkn problem
[17:10:35] <shoky> you, mostly
[17:10:39] <FriendlySeal> ill beat ur fkn ass
[17:10:52] <Vivekananda> oww now where did this start from ?
[17:10:53] <shoky> yeah, enough of this already
[17:11:07] <systemfault> Oh yeah
[17:11:10] <Vivekananda> lol
[17:11:40] <motaka2> shoky: What was the problem with that guy ?
[17:11:43] <ryanneufeld> oh snap
[17:11:49] <ryanneufeld> shoky dropping the hammer
[17:11:50] <shoky> he's a constant asshole here for the past few weeks
[17:12:02] <shoky> and tlks lik dis
[17:12:05] <systemfault> Indeed.
[17:12:05] <shoky> fuck that.
[17:12:11] <systemfault> He can't even write properly.
[17:12:24] <ryanneufeld> shoky: I +q'd a guy like that a while back
[17:12:32] <Vivekananda> okay so one thing I saw in documents is that if I have to do both .done and .fail for an ajax the way used is like this : $request = $ ajax{};  and then $request.done() and $request.fail()
[17:12:35] <shoky> not sure what +q is ;D
[17:12:46] <shoky> sounds harsh tho
[17:13:18] <motaka2> shoky: He was not talking about js or jq. and you try to help everyine. shame on him
[17:13:31] <shoky> ;]
[17:14:09] <motaka2> my form doesnt submit at all
[17:14:12] <Vivekananda> but if I wanted to write it without having a reference first how do I do that ? can I collate both together with $ajax({ .. }).done(){}.fail(){}  or something ?
[17:14:24] <systemfault> Exactly.
[17:14:27] <Argorok> Done ;)
[17:14:27] <systemfault> Or!
[17:14:36] <systemfault> Vivekananda: There's also .then
[17:14:49] <ryanneufeld> $ajax({ .. }).done({}).fail({}) @Vivekananda
[17:14:55] <ryanneufeld> or wait
[17:14:55] <systemfault> Vivekananda: $.ajax().then(function() { SUCCESS! }, function() { FAILURE});
[17:14:56] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[17:14:56] <shoky> noo don't tell him about .then
[17:14:57] <ryanneufeld> no
[17:15:02] <shoky> it'll confuse him too much
[17:15:05] <Vivekananda> ryanneufeld: thanks will note it down
[17:15:10] <ryanneufeld> Vivekananda: yeah, what systemfault said
[17:15:10] <systemfault> shoky: Sorry :/
[17:15:33] <shoky> oh, that usage of .then  is ok
[17:15:38] <ryanneufeld> $ajax({ .. }).done(function(){//code }).fail(function{//code}) @Vivekananda
[17:15:48] <Vivekananda> shoky: if I am not scared of being confused why is not telling a good idea ?
[17:16:03] <shoky> Vivekananda it's me who's scared of you being confused ;]
[17:16:15] <Vivekananda> shoky: :) Yes I understand that
[17:16:22] <shoky> heh
[17:16:34] <Vivekananda> but see! I found a way of writing the fail and done without help
[17:16:41] <Vivekananda> so you should not be THAt  scared
[17:16:55] <shoky> k i'll chill
[17:17:42] <Vivekananda> systemfault: I will look at then documentation
[17:17:51] <Vivekananda> also will note down the done
[17:18:05] <Vivekananda> actually why not I use it in my code so will have itfor laters
[17:19:48] <systemfault> It's a good thing you learn about promises... because it's the future :P
[17:21:15] <motaka2> shoky: $formFake.submit(); this doesnt work for me
[17:21:23] <ryanneufeld> I can promise you systemfault is correct
[17:21:43] <shoky> motaka2: how about $formFake[0].submit()   ?
[17:22:03] <motaka2> shoky: lemme see
[17:22:51] <motaka2> shoky: $formFake[0].submit is not a function
[17:23:20] <systemfault> motaka2: You "unwrap" the jQuery object when you use [0]
[17:23:38] <motaka2> so?
[17:24:46] <motaka2> systemfault: Should I selet the form from dom again and call submit on it ?
[17:25:05] <systemfault> It really depends, I haven't seen your code.
[17:25:49] <systemfault> Just said that if you use the indexing operator on a jQuery object, it unwraps it and you get a "pure" DOM node (Without anything jQuery)
[17:26:55] <JuanDaugherty> xmlhttprequest was what was needed in js
[17:27:33] <shoky> motaka2 that's weird, based on the code you showed.. i'd need to see a fiddle/demo
[17:28:01] <motaka2> shoky: lemme see if I can upload anything thx for ur care
[17:32:21] <motaka2> shoky: http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/InSearch
[17:33:07] <motaka2> shoky: type a and click on one of the results. and then click ثبت button
[17:33:47] <motaka2> by clicking that button a fake fome must be created and submited. the form will create but it doesn't submit
[17:44:15] <motaka2> shoky:
[17:51:40] <motaka2> Anyone there?
[17:51:51] <motaka2> Maybe I am disconnected
[17:54:41] <shoky> motaka2 i'll check in  a minute
[17:54:59] <motaka2> shoky: I tought I was disconnected thank you
[17:59:19] <shoky> motaka2 when i type i get this error   Uncaught ReferenceError: findHighestZIndex is not defined
[18:00:04] <motaka2> lemme upload everything
[18:00:55] <motaka2> shoky: done
[18:01:42] <shoky> motaka2  still getting that error
[18:02:20] <motaka2> shoky: Yes and I dont know what is that
[18:02:54] <shoky> it's what it says it is
[18:03:01] <shoky> you're calling an undefined function
[18:03:35] <shoky> $curResWrap.css("z-index", findHighestZIndex("*"));
[18:03:40] <motaka2> shoky: I have added that func newly, it must be in Js.js
[18:04:20] <shoky> motaka2: no, it's not anywhere
[18:04:47] <shoky> now it's there
[18:04:55] <motaka2> shoky: pls load with ctrl+shirft+r
[18:05:01] <motaka2> :)
[18:05:03] <shoky> i did, it only updated now
[18:07:10] <motaka2> so you still get the error?
[18:10:58] <shoky> motaka2 ah i see the problem
[18:11:05] <motaka2> :)
[18:11:08] <shoky> motaka2 it's because you put an <input name="submit"
[18:11:19] <shoky> that's overriding the "submit" function because the browser is an idiot
[18:11:27] <shoky> don't put an input name="submit"
[18:12:28] <motaka2> shoky: I have to do that. ControllerAction decides on that value weather I am submitting the form or showing it
[18:16:13] <shoky> motaka2 that's unfortunate...
[18:17:07] <shoky> see  also  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1414
[18:17:12] <shoky> marked as "wontfix"
[18:17:44] <shoky> having the input name="submit"  overwrites the "submit" property which is needed to manually submit it
[18:18:56] <shoky> quote from there:   What have we learned? DO NOT USE "submit" or "reset" as input name attribute values.
[18:18:58] <motaka2> shoky: So what's your suggestion ?
[18:20:08] <shoky> one of these:  1> use a better server-side solution.  2> learn to configure your current server-side to not depend on the name="submit" input. 3> submit the form via ajax
[18:20:54] <motaka2> shoky thx for finding the problem. It is really nice of you
[18:21:07] <shoky> 4> don't submit from javascript, just submit a real (non-fake non-dynamic) form
[18:21:18] <shoky> np
[18:21:58] <motaka2> shoky: is this way wrong to add a css file? $("head").append($('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="' + confsFin.pathToTheme + '" />')); ?
[18:22:34] <shoky> that should work i think..  but .. why not just keep things simple :(
[18:23:01] <shoky> do things simply, dont make fake forms and fake submits and fake <link>s
[18:23:31] <shoky> the right way to add a css file is to put a <link> in the <head> in your html file
[18:23:35] <shoky> not in your javascript code
[18:23:59] <shoky> if you do something else, make sure you have a very good reason
[18:26:19] <hooliogan132> ah jflow is a nice little slider
[18:27:28] <hooliogan132> fast, cross compatibility, and not to confugulated for every day use
[18:28:29] <hooliogan132> also its kind of cool because you can have several images in 1 slide then slide to the next batch to save screen space like a pro
[18:30:14] <motaka2> shoky: I make a fakeform cause I need to load some results to the user based on what he has typed in input and then when he submits I need to return the database id value of that selection instead of the string so I thought it would be better to use a fake form and submit that instead of the existing one
[18:30:38] <BillCriswell> hooliogan132: Carousels are the devil.
[18:31:17] <shoky> motaka2 you can put the id value in a hidden input in the original form.
[18:31:32] <shoky> motaka2 and you can submit via ajax
[18:32:34] <motaka2> shoky: If I put that in an hidden input with same name, which value would be accpted on server side?
[18:32:41] <shoky> not with the same name
[18:32:56] <motaka2> shoky: I have to do it with the same name
[18:33:02] <shoky> why..
[18:33:11] <shoky> change the textbox's name, then
[18:33:19] <shoky> you don't care about its value
[18:33:53] <motaka2> cause it's a general solution I want to use that plugin for a lot of inputs, I dont want to change the client or serverside code to tell them what is fake and what is not
[18:35:55] <motaka2> I load css that way cause I just want to worry about js and the moment I add js I could be sure it will find the theme to load
[18:36:06] <motaka2> although it doesn't work either
[18:38:36] <shoky> motaka2  you can hide the fakeForm, and instead of <input type="hidden" name="submit">  just put the submit button
[18:38:41] <shoky> motaka2  and then  .click() it :\
[18:39:37] <motaka2> shoky: I don t get you
[18:40:45] <shoky> fakeform:   <form ..>  <input type="hidden" name="id" value="1">   <input type="submit" name="submit" value="ثبت">  </form>
[18:41:07] <shoky> $fakeForm.find('input[type=submit]').click()
[18:41:23] <motaka2> shoky: so in this case I will have two submit buttons
[18:41:34] <shoky> in fakeform? just one
[18:41:58] <shoky> and that's why i said  "you can hide the fakeform"
[18:41:58] <motaka2> shoky: and another one in $form, they both will be visible
[18:42:02] <shoky> so it wont be visible
[18:42:12] <shoky> $fakeForm.hide()
[18:42:37] <motaka2> ah ok. thx that's a good idea
[18:42:42] <motaka2> what about this one
[18:42:54] <snollux> Hello! When I try to do a $.post{id:0, value:v} where v is a variable containing an integer, for some reason 'v' doesn't seem to get resolved and the post never executes
[18:42:58] <snollux> any idea why that could be?
[18:43:06] <snollux> if I hardcode the value it works
[18:43:28] <shoky> snollux well that's not valid javascript.. how about you show your actual code
[18:44:09] <shoky> better yet make a jsfiddle
[18:44:17] <snollux> ok shoky :)
[18:44:51] <motaka2> shoky: What's the click event for?
[18:45:22] <shoky> motaka2:  click on the submit button?  for submitting the form ;p
[18:50:51] <motaka2> shoky: I got a dc
[18:51:26] <shoky> motaka2: i said:   click on the submit button?  for submitting the form ;p
[18:52:33] <motaka2> why do I need a click event ?
[18:52:43] <shoky> to submit the form
[18:54:19] <motaka2> shoky: may you please check the new code?  http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/InSearch  I dont understand you very well
[18:54:31] <shoky> how else would you submit the form?
[18:54:38] <shoky> we saw that .submit()  doesn't work
[18:54:54] <shoky> so i suggested adding a submit button and triggering a click on it, as another way to submit the form
[18:56:29] <shoky> motaka2:  change the line  $formFake.submit()   to:    $formFake.find('input[type=submit]').click()
[18:56:33] <motaka2> u mean I have to bind a click event on the real form's submit button ?
[18:56:51] <shoky> no, i didn't say to bind any click event
[18:56:56] <shoky> i said to trigger a click event
[18:57:15] <shoky> calling  .click()  triggers a click event
[19:00:56] <motaka2> shoky: It is working, I dont know how. But it is working. You are awesome
[19:01:36] <shoky> motaka2  calling .click()  simulates a click on the button, as if you clicked the submit button of the fake form
[19:02:39] <motaka2> got it. Was that bug something specialised to jquery? I mean could we use pure javascript to submit the form ?
[19:03:04] <shoky> nope it's not jquery-specific
[19:03:19] <shoky> it's a browser thing
[19:03:26] <motaka2> :)
[19:03:31] <shoky> i think on firefox  it would work ok like it was before
[19:03:31] <motaka2> funny
[19:03:49] <motaka2> shoky: no I was testing on firefox
[19:04:09] <shoky> oh, oh well
[19:04:20] <shoky> so all browsers are stupid :\
[19:04:23] <motaka2> shoky: Do you have any idea why styles do not apply ?
[19:04:51] <shoky> in your link?  they are.  but earlier they weren't, because the CSS files had a problem loading
[19:06:23] <tripflex> does anybody know a good site for browsing and finding good js scripts?  My common method is to keep track of dailyjs or just browse through GitHub, but searching google didnt turn up too much in results for a stie to "browse" js scripts
[19:06:39] <tripflex> because im really only looking for jquery or new javascript like files that can be used in web dev
[19:06:54] <tripflex> i mean with all this this.js that.js andthattoo.js out there now, it's hard to keep track :-p
[19:07:13] <motaka2> Shoky what do u mean?
[19:07:39] <shoky> motaka2 i mean what i said..
[19:07:47] <shoky> they are applying fine now
[19:08:09] <motaka2> :) So why I cant see them
[19:08:11] <shoky> i don't see any css problems
[19:08:22] <shoky> console doesn't say anything?
[19:09:01] <BeWilled> why is siteInterval only running once here? http://pastebin.com/15F9Twhm
[19:09:29] <motaka2> shoky: I need to load Theme.css the one I try to load on line 66.
[19:09:35] <motaka2> but I cant see it
[19:09:49] <shoky> BeWilled  doStuff(this)   calls the function already right there
[19:10:50] <BeWilled> shoky: although it's only called once. Not many times every 500ms
[19:11:07] <shoky> BeWilled you can use  setInterval(doStuff.bind(this), 500)    or:  var elem = this;  setInterval(function() { doStuff(elem); }, 500)
[19:11:32] <shoky> BeWilled sorry  the first one should be  setInterval(doStuff.bind(null, this), 500)
[19:12:13] <shoky> BeWilled  setInterval(doStuff(this), 500)  calls it doStuff(this) right away and passes the _returned value_ to setInterval
[19:13:50] <BeWilled> shoky: I'm felling lot's of love towards you atm, its true
[19:14:01] <shoky> motaka2:  the <link> is there,  but the contents of Theme.css are:   The page you are looking for is not available! click <a href="http://fa.noondreams.com/">here</a> to go back to the home page.
[19:14:52] <shoky> BeWilled heh let's hope i can contain it all
[19:15:08] <motaka2> shoky: the path must be relative. why does it load the full path ?
[19:15:34] <shoky> motaka2 donno what you mean.. the added tag is:  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Theme.css">
[19:15:45] <BeWilled> shoky: its the right amount don't worry ;)
[19:16:24] <motaka2> shoky: Theme.css is in the same forlder as SearchIn.js
[19:16:53] <shoky> motaka2: and InSearch.js  has a diffrent path, right
[19:17:45] <motaka2> shoky: No, I mean InSearch.js is in the same folder as Theme.css
[19:17:48] <shoky> motaka2: i mean the url for Insearch.js  that appears in <head>  is not just  "InSearch.js"   like you did with Theme.css
[19:18:02] <shoky> motaka2: then use the same folder path for Theme.css in the <link> you're adding
[19:18:19] <shoky> don't just put  "Theme.css"  because that loads it from  http://fa.noondreams.com/Test/Theme.css
[19:18:50] <motaka2> shoky: How can I load relative to InSearch.css then ?
[19:19:11] <shoky> you can't load relative to a separate file, only relative to the current webpage
[19:19:16] <shoky> (or absolute)
[19:19:46] <motaka2> ah ok thx
[19:21:45] <motaka2> shoky: How does google translate widget have styles with itself then. or weather wigets when you put them on your personal website ?
[19:23:11] <shoky> wat
[19:23:14] <shoky> no idea what you're talking about
[19:23:39] <motaka2> shoky: dont answer that. :) it is seven am here! I am becoming crazy. You did a lot. thx
[19:23:39] <shoky> anyway like i said you can use absolute urls..
[19:23:49] <shoky> heh
[19:24:23] <motaka2> shoky: Thanks for your great help. Do you know a good javascript book I can read ?
[19:24:26] <shoky> 5:20am here ;S
[19:24:41] <motaka2> shoky: you are in turkey ?
[19:24:53] <shoky> hmm dont really know a javascript book i like
[19:24:55] <shoky> israel
[19:25:28] <motaka2> shoky: Ah great, I am in Iran
[19:25:37] <shoky> yeap ;p
[19:26:16] <motaka2> Again thx for your help. I couldn't finish this without your help.
[19:26:35] <shoky> you're welcome
[19:34:10] <motaka2> shoky: Do you think if it would take a long time so I can code something to navigate between the results using uo and down arrows and select them by return key and stuff like that ?
[19:35:24] <shoky> it would probably take a while to get everything working good with no bugs, all edge-cases taken care of..
[19:37:08] <motaka2> ah ok I think this feature  is neccessary. Everyone expects it those keys working on ajax results.
[19:39:26] <shoky> tried jquery-ui autocomplete?
[19:40:59] <motaka2> shoky: No, I know it but I prefer not go farther with frameworks. It took me several years to convience my self using jquery(the only framework I use both in client and serverside world).
[19:43:01] <shoky> it's not hard to use. easier than making your own ;p
[19:45:29] <motaka2> yupe, I know and I was advised by my friends too. Maybe I am addicted to reinvent the wheel in my own way all the time
[19:46:56] <shoky> that's fine, you just seemed to be worried about how long it would take you
[19:47:26] <shoky> it would take  along time to get to the stability that something like jquery-ui has. (not that it's perfect)
[19:50:09] <motaka2> shoky: I am not so good in javascript. At least it might help me improve my skills. Meanwhile I have to confess anytime i invented a new wheel I was a lot more comfortable with it rather than a well organised external library. But overall everyone else confirms your point of view and condumn my unnecessary efforts.
[19:50:48] <shoky> nah not condemning, i'm all for it
[20:10:26] <tripflex> does anybody know a good site for browsing and finding good js scripts? My common method is to keep track of dailyjs or just browse through GitHub, but searching google didnt turn up too much in results for a stie to "browse" js scripts, because im really only looking for jquery or new javascript like files that can be used in web dev, i mean with all this this.js that.js andthattoo.js out there now, it's hard to keep track :-P
[20:19:46] <motaka2> shoky: have a nice day. I am going to bed. Thx again for ur help. Bye
[20:27:16] <DiegoMax> hello there
[20:27:18] <DiegoMax> quick question
[20:27:48] <DiegoMax> i want to use Child Selector (“parent > child”)
[20:28:06] <DiegoMax> inside a callback method, however on my callback method, "parent" would be $(this)
[20:28:26] <DiegoMax> what is the proper syntax to use $(this) and the child selector ?
[20:31:07] <vladikoff> DiegoMax, http://api.jquery.com/find/ , http://api.jquery.com/children/
[20:31:36] <DiegoMax> thanks
[20:32:08] <vladikoff> DiegoMax, also https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-selector-context
[20:34:15] <DiegoMax> thanks vladikoff
[20:34:19] <DiegoMax> this seems to be working :D
[20:34:19] <DiegoMax> $(this).children('textarea').ckeditor().focus()
[20:34:41] <DiegoMax> still learning my way with jq's api
[21:28:04] <igcewieling> I'm not all that great with selectors.   It looks like this is returning no elements, does anything look obviously wrong? $('label#route_edit, #route_edit:input, #route_edit.select-arrow').not('#route_edit_status, #route_edit:button, #route_edit:hidden, label[for="route_edit_status"]')
[21:29:49] <shoky> igcewieling why are you selecting the same id with 3 different selectors?  and why all that stuff in the .not(..)  ?
[21:30:48] <igcewieling> shoky: #route_edit is a <div> with a bunch of elements inside it, is that what you are asking?
[21:31:17] <shoky> why not just  $('#route_edit') ?
[21:31:30] <shoky> why  label#route_edit  if  it's a div?
[21:31:32] <shoky> etc..
[21:31:49] <igcewieling> because if I use #route_edit I'll match a bunch of things I don't want to match
[21:32:02] <shoky> why, do you have the same id on multiple elements?
[21:32:07] <shoky> that's wrong and invalid
[21:32:12] <shoky> and is the first thing you should fix
[21:32:18] <igcewieling> I don't.
[21:32:28] <shoky> then why would it match other things..
[21:32:31] <igcewieling> I presume my selectors are all messed up.
[21:32:42] <shoky> $('#route_edit')  finds  <div id="route_edit">
[21:32:46] <shoky> you don't need more than that..
[21:33:06] <shoky> and as for the .not  you'd need to explain what it's there for. not making any sense to me so far
[21:35:01] <igcewieling> I want to match all <label>, all :input, all .select-arrow elements contained in the element #route_edit.  I want to exclude any elements which are #route_edit_status, all :button, all :hidden, and the <label for="route_edit_status">
[21:35:30] <igcewieling> when I say "all :button"  I mean "all :button contained in #route_edit container.
[21:35:53] <igcewieling> I don't want to go around messing with stuff in other containers
[21:36:08] <shoky> ok then you did it totally wrong
[21:36:19] <igcewieling> I am open for suggestions.
[21:37:01] <shoky> $('#route_edit').find('label, :input, .select-arrow').not('#route_edit_status, :button, :hidden, label[for="route_edit_status"]')
[21:37:28] <shoky> label#route_edit  means  a <label> with id="route_edit"
[21:37:40] <shoky> #route_edit:input  means an <input>  with id="route_edit"
[21:37:56] <shoky> #route_edit.select-arrow means  an element with that id and class
[21:38:06] <igcewieling> ah!  I thought it meant a label inside the ed #route_edit.
[21:38:18] <shoky> $('#route_edit .select-arrow')  is what you'd want, as an example
[21:38:24] <BillCriswell> shoky: You working on anything good?
[21:39:11] <shoky> BillCriswell no :(  i was gonna start a nice project for these dudes who seemed serious but yesterday it turned out they're lame so it's a no go
[21:39:24] <shoky> you?
[21:39:43] <BillCriswell> I wish. I keep starting bull shit and just getting bored half way through.
[21:40:04] <shoky> hmrm
[21:41:39] <igcewieling> shoky: the find seems to find all the expected elements, but when I add the not, none match.  I'm checking a few things
[21:43:04] <Velveeta> i'm working on something good right now
[21:43:35] <shoky> i hope it's pasta
[21:44:05] <Velveeta> $(this).appendTo('.bed:first').css('vertical-align', 'top')
[21:44:26] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha
[21:44:50] <shoky> setTimeout(life, 10*3600)
[21:45:04] <shoky> er, mizzing some zeros
[21:45:09] <shoky> heh. missing, even
[21:45:09] <Velveeta> heheheh
[21:45:26] <igcewieling> shoky: When I remove the :hidden from the .not() it works as expected, but if I add it back in nothing matches.   Makes no sense.
[21:45:34] <Velveeta> setInterval(bathroom, 4*3600000)
[21:46:04] <Velveeta> igcewieling: what's the selector you're trying to work with?
[21:46:20] <Velveeta> or i guess i could scroll back and read
[21:46:24] <shoky> igcewieling mm maybe add the hidden separately.. like   .not('#route_edit_status, :button, label[..]').not(':hidden')    or just don't use :hidden :\
[21:46:39] <igcewieling> Velveeta: shoky kindly suggested this.  $('#route_edit').find('label, :input, .select-arrow').not('#route_edit_status, :button, :hidden, label[for="route_edit_status"]')
[21:47:10] <igcewieling> shoky: I currently only have a few hidden items, I could name them by id if nothing else presents itself.
[21:47:34] <Velveeta> hm, i would probably have gone with what shoky said also, but that's not working?
[21:47:36] <shoky> igcewieling you're not thinking of  <input type="hidden"  right?
[21:48:05] <igcewieling> Velveeta: if I :hidden is in the .not() nothing appears to match
[21:48:19] <igcewieling> doesn't make sense to me so I assume I screwed something up. 8-|
[21:49:45] <igcewieling> shoky: yes.  <input class="" type="hidden" id="route_edit_sid" name="sid" value="">
[21:50:01] <shoky> :hidden  matches more than just those
[21:50:29] <shoky> it also matches elements with display:none
[21:50:34] <Velveeta> right
[21:50:39] <shoky> or generally, non visible elements
[21:50:44] <shoky> see the docs for details
[21:50:54] <Velveeta> yeah, visibility hidden also, it's actually a fairly expensive selector
[21:51:02] <igcewieling> oh!  I'm checking the :input docs now.
[21:51:10] <shoky> don't think it checks visiblity hdiden
[21:51:16] <shoky> nor opacity
[21:51:17] <Velveeta> if you just want not type="hidden", you should use the attribute selector for that: [type="hidden"]
[21:51:18] <igcewieling> ..er.. the :hidden docs.
[21:51:40] <igcewieling> Velveeta: *nod*  that is what I was thinking
[21:52:34] <igcewieling> input[type="hidden"] would be the same thing but more wordy?
[21:53:01] <Velveeta> yeah, but might be faster also, if it scopes it to inputs first, and then checks attributes
[21:53:02] <shoky> in a filter/not  selector its the same yea
[21:53:07] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how it works internally to optimize that
[21:53:23] <shoky> er scratch what i said
[21:54:20] <Velveeta> ok, i'm out for tonight, adios :)
[21:54:31] <shoky> bye pasta-man
[22:26:44] <the8thbit> hello, how would I use .load() to load an html file compiled from a jade template?
[22:31:02] <BillCriswell> the8thbit: How it's compiled wouldn't matter. Just $('.load-content-here').load('somefile.html');
[22:31:29] <the8thbit> BillCriswell: What I mean is, I don't know what the actual filename is
[22:32:01] <the8thbit> and I assume I can't do .load( somefile.jade)
[22:32:16] <shoky> your server is serving the output at some url
[22:32:28] <shoky> and if it's not, you need to take care of that first
[22:32:59] <the8thbit> shoky: http://localhost:8080/, so ./index.htm ?
[22:33:14] <shoky> it totally depends on your server and what you're doing with it
[22:33:52] <the8thbit> its a nodejs server
[22:34:09] <shoky> then you have some express route that is serving that jade template
[22:34:14] <shoky> what is the url in that route?
[22:34:25] <shoky> if you don't have such a route, you need to set it up
[22:34:40] <the8thbit> I'm not sure how to find that route
[22:34:58] <shoky> then you need to learn some node.js/express (assuming you're using express)
[22:35:05] <shoky> not really a question for this channel
[22:35:21] <the8thbit> this is my code I'm using to load the jade file: http://pastebin.com/cjXxag1E
[22:35:48] <shoky> so the url is /
[22:36:05] <vladikoff>  /tpl
[22:36:16] <shoky> no that's local
[22:36:17] <the8thbit> vladikoff: /tpl is the location of the jade file
[22:36:46] <the8thbit> shoky: Hm, so what would the file name be? It can't just be /
[22:36:56] <shoky> it's a url , not a filename
[22:37:03] <shoky> .load('/')
[22:37:09] <vladikoff> shoky, what
[22:37:12] <the8thbit> Ah
[22:37:22] <vladikoff> shoky, he wants to load  a jade template from tpl
[22:37:25] <vladikoff> shoky, why load itself?
[22:37:36] <shoky> he was asking about .load
[22:37:55] <the8thbit> vladikoff: because now I understand how to do it in general :)
[22:38:06] <vladikoff> ok
[22:38:06] <shoky> and i just meant the /tpl  is a directory name in his server, it's not part of the url
[22:38:37] <BillCriswell> My cat fell asleep on my lap. Way too fat. My damn lap is asleep.
[22:39:32] <the8thbit> BillCriswell: Oh no, it's spreading!
[22:39:49] <the8thbit> Soon enough, your whole body will be asleep
[22:40:08] <BillCriswell> Starting to feel that way.
[22:40:13] <the8thbit> just try to stay as still as possible
[22:40:20] <the8thbit> or try to move around as much as possible
[22:40:30] <the8thbit> I don't know, I always get sleep and quicksand mixed up
[22:40:47] <BillCriswell> Not familiar with quicksand.
[22:41:20] <the8thbit> BillCriswell: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksand
[22:41:44] <BillCriswell> the8thbit: What does that have to do with sleep though?
[22:41:48] <BillCriswell> Oh duh.
[22:41:51] <BillCriswell> I get it now.
[22:42:09] <the8thbit> :)
[22:42:51] <BillCriswell> I hate getting a good nights sleep sometimes. I'm going to be up all night tonight.
[22:44:47] <vladikoff> BillCriswell, watch House of Cards ;)
[22:45:28] <BillCriswell> vladikoff: I'm rewatching Breaking Bad currently.
[22:45:52] <BillCriswell> It's still intense even though I know what's going to happen.
[22:51:10] <systemfault> Yeah bitch!
[22:51:27] <systemfault> One day.. I will rewatch them all
[22:51:39] <BillCriswell> It's worth it haha.
[22:52:17] <BillCriswell> Even if you just watch the first episode just thinking about the transformation Walt goes through is insane.
[22:53:27] <systemfault> Yeah, it's crazy. I actually liked the ending. Unlike .... F'ing Dexter
[22:53:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah I loved the ending as well... Dexter pissed me off as it did many haha.
[22:54:49] <systemfault> Well.... in both shows, the IQ of the protagonist was magically lowered by a good 40 points.
[22:54:56] <systemfault> (On the last season)
[22:56:09] <BillCriswell> Haha
[22:56:49] <BillCriswell> Trying to recall the last season of Dexter in depth, not having much luck..
[23:01:35] <BillCriswell> Night dudes.

[23:34:15] <Darkingz> Hi, i'm working on a project for personal enjoyment and I was using JQuery but when i try to animate, it is throwing a length of undefined error, can i have some help? (here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/z7DBb/)
[23:40:28] <specious> Darkingz: your external scripts js/*.js aren't going to load in that jsfiddle
[23:41:35] <Darkingz> http://jsfiddle.net/z7DBb/1/
[23:41:38] <Darkingz> sorry, updated it
[23:41:48] <Darkingz> the external one was just a table div
[23:42:05] <Darkingz> so it didn't seem important since it's the animate which was bugging
[23:42:15] <Darkingz> i just didn't get rid of the code
[23:42:20] <Darkingz> for loading it
[23:45:07] <Tomashe> ii dont get it , i created a funciton on my global scope. set it inside a function, try to load it outside ofthe function , after it was already set and i get undefined :/
[23:45:09] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[23:45:18] <snollux> Any idea why this .load() doesn't seem to do anything? or the append, for that matter http://jsfiddle.net/6Aakp/
[23:45:37] <snollux> Oh damn, now it does here.. i wonder if it's the other browser?
[23:45:49] <Darkingz> @tomashe same code as before?
[23:45:50] <snollux> actually it just loaded in the TEST now, but not the google html
[23:46:14] <Darkingz> did you do this.variable?
[23:46:14] <specious> snollux: open your console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://google.com/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[23:46:23] <vladikoff> snollux, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[23:46:32] <vladikoff> Darkingz, your 2 js files are 404ing
[23:46:34] <snollux> ahh I see
[23:46:35] <Tomashe> yes , same
[23:46:39] <Tomashe> i change it a bit but
[23:46:59] <Darkingz> ah @vlad lets try: http://jsfiddle.net/z7DBb/2/
[23:47:07] <Darkingz> i got rid of any and all external files
[23:47:07] <Tomashe> i got var x; , and the a funtion Init() { x = 1 } and then $)
[23:47:21] <Darkingz> ini the function you need to this.x
[23:47:40] <Tomashe> i got var x; , and the a funtion Init() { x = 1 } and then $("body").on("click",".x",function() { console.log(x); }); this get me undefinde
[23:47:54] <Darkingz> @tomashe and don't forget to intialize the x variable too
[23:47:56] <specious> Darkingz: the box moves right and alert says "completed"
[23:48:06] <Tomashe> init x varible too?
[23:48:07] <Tomashe> means?
[23:49:08] <Darkingz> huh that's strange, it doesn't move whhen i open it from my comp... hmmmm
[23:49:34] <Tomashe> Darkingz?
[23:49:37] <specious> Darkingz: Chrome 33 on osx here
[23:49:41] <Tomashe> what did u mean?
[23:50:22] <Darkingz> @specious this is what i get chrome (32 win)
[23:50:24] <Darkingz> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[23:50:31] <Darkingz> which seems to come from the animate
[23:51:33] <Darkingz> @tomashe your function (hopefully you misspelled that typing here) Init x can't set the scope you have to change it to Init(){this.x=1}
[23:52:09] <Tomashe> really?
[23:52:15] <Tomashe> i never heard about it
[23:52:38] <Tomashe> usualy i was just using "x" inside my function
[23:52:42] <Tomashe> without need the this.x
[23:53:03] <Tomashe> what if i was doing var x = 1 < was that set the global?
[23:53:07] <Darkingz> if you have a function within a function it's usually a scope thing
[23:53:17] <Darkingz> because you put var
[23:53:21] <Tomashe> this funcitons isnt isnide a function
[23:53:21] <Darkingz> that makes it local scope
[23:53:36] <Tomashe> init
[23:53:43] <Darkingz> huh usually that clears it though try
[23:53:47] <Tomashe> init() function is on the gloval scope aswell
[23:53:54] <vladikoff> Tomashe, pastebin your code
[23:54:32] <Tomashe> i can not , its too large to past my actual code but , this example i gave it same pricible
[23:54:44] <vladikoff> Tomashe, what example
[23:55:04] <Tomashe> ok i guess i was needed to use var x = 1 inside my funtion Init()
[23:55:10] <Tomashe> valadikoff , my eample was that
[23:55:16] <Tomashe> i got var x; , and the a funtion Init() { x = 1 } and then $("body").on("click",".x",function() { console.log(x); }); this get me undefinde
[23:55:43] <vladikoff> Tomashe, http://jsfiddle.net/34Q3Y/1/
[23:57:39] <Tomashe> i have no idea for me it gets undefined
[23:57:40] <Tomashe> hmm
[23:57:44] <Tomashe> but when i use VAR its ok
[23:58:01] <Tomashe> i will just add var
[23:59:25] <Tomashe> what about function isndie a function?
