[02:05:47] <io_____> hi i am looking for a plugin to zoom and pan images plus it should let me easily set a few interest points and automate the zoom and pan to those points
[02:09:35] <ash_m> how are you supposed to encapsulate jQuery? var jQuery = function(
[02:10:13] <ash_m> how are you supposed to encapsulate jQuery? var jQuery = (function($){ ...}(jQuery)); * or something like that
[02:11:25] <arthurvr> ash_m: not exactly no. Let me show you a fiddle
[02:11:53] <arthurvr> ash_m: http://jsbin.com/vozoqiduti/1/
[02:12:35] <ash_m> arthurvr: okay, that's what I thought... does this self-execute?
[02:12:48] <arthurvr> yes
[02:13:47] <ash_m> at run time?
[02:13:58] <arthurvr> yes
[02:14:02] <arthurvr> but not in the fiddle
[02:14:05] <arthurvr> jquery isn’t included there
[02:14:19] <ash_m> so any function enclosed in () will self-execute?
[02:14:32] <arthurvr> no
[02:14:40] <arthurvr> the last brackets execute it
[02:14:44] <arthurvr> passing it jQuery
[02:15:00] <dimi1947> I am having trouble getting the ID of a series of input elements...this is the code I use...but it does not work $('#week').find('input[type=text]').each(function()
[02:15:01] <dimi1947>          {$(this).prop("id")});
[02:15:16] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/perili/2/
[02:15:22] <arthurvr> dimi1947: lemme take a look
[02:15:48] <arthurvr> please try to reduce your problem first.
[02:16:35] <ash_m> arthurvr: I see... so what does (function ... ) do?.. it is the syntax for passing ()(jQuery) ?
[02:17:03] <dimi1947> ash_m are you talking to me?
[02:17:07] <arthurvr> ash_m: gonna redirect you to http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/. We’re not here to teach javascript ;)
[02:17:33] <ash_m> arthurvr: thanks
[02:17:38] <ash_m> arthurvr: :)
[02:17:43] <arthurvr> ;)
[02:18:20] <arthurvr> ash_m: if you have any more questions feel free to ask
[02:18:23] <dimi1947> arthurvr...can you be more specific about reducing my  problem
[02:18:59] <arthurvr> dimi1947: you should try to encapsulate the problem you’re having, instead of dropping in a whole bb view.
[02:19:36] <arthurvr> dimi1947: that makes it easier for both us and for you as you’re likely to undertand the problem better then
[02:19:43] <arthurvr> ~understand
[02:19:49] * arthurvr can’t spell
[02:20:57] <dimi1947> forge the bb view for now...let us assume the we are just having an HTML with input elements and we want to get their IDs
[02:21:19] <arthurvr> Yes, that’s what I mean, please reduce your testcase to that and many people will be happy to help.
[02:21:39] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions last paragraph
[02:21:44] <arthurvr> ;)
[02:22:26] <dimi1947> ok...then I will prepare a separate fiddle
[02:22:33] <arthurvr> thanks
[02:44:00] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/toyesa/4/   4 input elements...just what to get their IDs....so far I have tried various codes...one of example gives me only the first ID, but not all four of them:  $('#week').find('input[type=text]').prop( "id" );
[02:48:52] <arthurvr> dimi1947: do you just want the id’s as an array?
[02:49:02] <arthurvr> dimi1947: or do you need them in any special form?
[02:49:08] <dimi1947> yes...I thnik this should be OK
[02:49:18] <arthurvr> 5 minutes and I’ll show you
[02:50:29] <dimi1947> ok....many thanks
[02:54:31] <arthurvr> dimi1947: the first <input> does not have an id. How would you prefer to handle that? Don’t include it in the array or just an empty string?
[02:56:13] <arthurvr> dimi1947: I think this is what you want: http://jsbin.com/jemapasipa/1/edit?js,console,output
[03:01:39] <dimi1947> thanks...but there is something I do not understand
[03:01:51] <arthurvr> ask please :D
[03:02:23] <dimi1947> Am I correct to assume the for loop creates the array?
[03:02:41] <arthurvr> kinda yes. In the for loop I push things to the `ret` variable.
[03:02:49] <arthurvr> `ret` gets returned at the end of the function.
[03:03:37] <dimi1947> so....this line var ids = $('div').find('input').ids();...what is its use exactly?
[03:04:07] <arthurvr> it’s gets the div, finds all input elements inside of it, and calls our `ids` function on it.
[03:04:51] <arthurvr> dimi1947: you might want to read up on learn.jquery.com ;)
[03:05:27] <dimi1947> so in this line jQuery.fn.ids....the ids...is taken from var ids = $('div').find('input').ids();
[03:05:59] <arthurvr> No, the jQuery.fn.ids is a really quick jQuery plugin I wrote for you
[03:06:07] <arthurvr> which the lines under that just call.
[03:06:28] <arthurvr> again, that’s all explained on learn.jquery.com, fyi
[03:07:03] <dimi1947> ok...thanks....I know havr to incoporate this into backbone code
[03:08:10] <arthurvr> yep, can’t be difficult.
[03:40:22] <curiousmansi> when i can find the jquery interview questions. also i have never done the jquery plugin development. How can i learn it and practice it before my interview. May be i have 1 day time
[03:42:43] <decx> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/ http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/
[03:44:00] <arthurvr> curiousmansi: exactly ^
[03:44:11] <arthurvr> the whole learning site, in fact :)
[03:56:24] <curiousmansi> also i want to start contributing to jquery
[03:56:38] <arthurvr> curiousmansi: that’s awesome!
[03:57:18] <arthurvr> curiousmansi: I’m a team member so if you have any questions regarding contributing ;)
[04:01:09] <momomo> what is the best way to clear a form ?
[04:01:27] <momomo> form.get(0).reset() doens't work
[04:02:38] <arthurvr> momomo: http://jsbin.com/gufihunece/1/
[04:03:30] <momomo> arthurvr, doesn't work with default values: http://jsbin.com/nuneduhuta/1/edit
[04:03:51] <arthurvr> momomo: nice default values
[04:04:31] <arthurvr> momomo: that’s just a browser behaviour. That’s wanted. Resetting a form just resets all <input>’s to the default
[04:04:32] <momomo> my most common foobar
[04:05:04] <arthurvr> If you want to empty them all that’s possible but that isn’t resetting
[04:05:10] <arthurvr> shall I show you how?
[04:05:24] <momomo> is there a quick method for that?
[04:05:33] <arthurvr> no but we can make that if you want
[04:05:43] <momomo> and include it in jquery ?
[04:05:49] <momomo> :p
[04:05:52] <arthurvr> no but you can create a plugin
[04:06:03] <arthurvr> lemme show you
[04:06:15] <momomo> jQuery.fn.extend.poo = ...
[04:06:24] <momomo> or something like that
[04:06:31] <arthurvr> nope ;)
[04:06:56] <arthurvr> give me 5 minutes
[04:07:00] <momomo> ook
[04:07:30] <arthurvr> momomo: there you go sir http://jsbin.com/zigotewigi/1/
[04:08:36] <decx> or this.find(':input').val(function () {    return '';  });
[04:08:41] <arthurvr> yup
[04:09:05] <arthurvr> although, don’t use :input
[04:09:13] <arthurvr> especially not on large doms
[04:09:15] <arthurvr> super slow
[04:09:46] <momomo> life is cruel: http://jsbin.com/logovuyasi/1/edit
[04:10:03] <momomo> I found this online: http://hastebin.com/isukoxalup.coffee
[04:10:04] <arthurvr> momomo: it is.
[04:10:10] <momomo> i think it covers more than inputs
[04:10:19] <decx> well you can easily check the type in a conditional and go from there
[04:10:42] <momomo> decx, I was hoping there was something like this already presetn
[04:10:43] <decx> or reset form first and then remove defaults from inputs
[04:10:53] <arthurvr> http://jsbin.com/secidovoxo/1/ would work for the checkbxo
[04:10:57] <arthurvr> ~checkbox
[04:11:55] <decx> i thought typeof isnt safe anymore
[04:12:07] <arthurvr> decx: it isn’t but in this case :/
[04:12:08] <momomo> arthurvr, what about textarea?
[04:12:10] <momomo> select ?
[04:12:13] <momomo> lol
[04:12:27] <arthurvr> yup. guess you can just integrate them yourselves now lol :)
[04:12:38] <decx> ^^
[04:54:03] <fracture_pandeya> mouseenter/mouseleave is sometimes flickering for me, how to fix it?
[04:54:40] <arthurvr> fracture_pandeya: you might just be doing something wrong performance-wise. Could you fiddle something up?
[04:56:39] <fracture_pandeya> http://jsfiddle.net/L6are4ay/
[04:57:22] <arthurvr> fracture_pandeya: what is going wrong with that? Appears to work for me?
[04:59:11] <fracture_pandeya> hm does it still look ok ? http://jsfiddle.net/L6are4ay/1/
[04:59:42] <fracture_pandeya> dont know why, it keeps going up and down sometimes for a few seconds
[04:59:51] <arthurvr> oh but that’s normal
[04:59:59] <arthurvr> but that’s the indented behaviour.
[05:00:06] <arthurvr> lemme take a look if I can fix that for you
[05:02:10] <decx> good old slideUp/Down dance
[05:02:27] <arthurvr> yeah just have to clear I think
[05:03:11] <arthurvr> like this http://jsfiddle.net/6bebeqm1/1/ though it isn’t beautifull it doesn’t do the dance anymore
[05:03:43] <decx> is clearQueue() the same as stop()?
[05:03:59] <arthurvr> oh well stop would be possible as well
[05:04:41] <decx> ah clearqueue removes anything not just animation
[05:04:46] <arthurvr> yeah
[05:05:54] <arthurvr> fracture_pandeya: as I fyi, http://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/
[05:06:30] <fracture_pandeya> hm ok
[05:06:53] <arthurvr> slideup and slidedown are just animations so get in the queue
[05:07:14] <decx> til slideup and down are british
[05:07:27] <zapho53> I have a form with day, month, year fields which I want to submit to a REST api via '/day/month/year' but forms only use post data or query strings, neither of which fit the REST format.
[05:09:13] <zapho53> What do I need to convert my form fields into a REST-compatible request?
[05:09:28] <arthurvr> zapho53: you mean that’s just the url?
[05:09:34] <arthurvr> anyways rest for the win
[05:09:35] <zapho53> That's a GET request, I should add.
[05:10:08] <zapho53> arthurvr: day, month and year are form values.
[05:11:22] <zapho53> arthurvr: "for the win" ?
[05:11:36] <arthurvr> just use rest when it’s possible but that’s of topic here
[05:24:22] <Distraught> function setVisibility() { $(".main-nav li").css("display", "block"); }
[05:24:42] <arthurvr> Distraught: what’s up with that code?
[05:24:55] <Distraught> i want when onclick('setVisivility') to show the mail menu lis
[05:25:03] <Distraught> please give me a hint :S
[05:25:13] <Distraught> now it does not do a thing. What do i do wrong?
[05:25:39] <arthurvr> Can’t be difficult. Could you create a jsbin/jsfiddle?
[05:26:14] <Distraught> i ll try
[05:26:31] <arthurvr> thanks
[05:27:52] <decx> there already is a function for that: show()
[05:29:13] <Distraught> i believe the problem is in the call of  $(".main-nav li").css("display", "block");
[05:29:27] <Distraught> i want the li in class main-nav
[05:29:38] <Distraught> is that correct in the way i puted it?
[05:30:07] <decx> if you have a flyin menu then you generally show/hide the sub ul
[05:30:13] <decx> not the li
[05:30:39] <Distraught> hm y you re right about this
[05:32:44] <Distraught> well it does not work either. It's kind of difficult to put it in jfiddle coz many functions work only on mobile where the problem is.
[05:33:00] <Distraught> If i give you a link would that help?
[06:01:57] <sash_> Hrrrmm... Menus can be build css only btw.
[06:04:01] <GingerGeek> allOptions.find("div[data-option-list]").data("student-id", 12);
[06:04:01] <GingerGeek>                     console.log(allOptions.first("div[data-option-list]").data("student-id"));
[06:04:10] <GingerGeek> Why does this print "undefined"
[06:06:05] <arthurvr> GingerGeek: fiddle or jsbin maybe?
[06:09:20] <dimi1947> I am trying to grab a parent div but I cannot...I am aware of the parentNode property but in this case it will not do take a look here..http://jsbin.com/perili/4/ line 53 save function
[06:09:40] <dimi1947> e.target gives the ID of the submit button
[06:10:51] <dimi1947> I want to get div week in which the submit button is contained
[06:11:12] <dimi1947> look at the HTML pane of the bin
[06:14:47] <GingerGeek> It seems the .data method
[06:14:55] <GingerGeek> doesn't like working with stuff which isn't in the DOM
[06:46:23] <paulvd> hello, i am using fullcalendar, popularing the calendar with json, the var_dump of json looks fine, however when i move it to events: classes, the special charaters such as hyphen (-) are escaped and shows as html ?
[07:01:31] <hd1> have a bunch of epoch timestamps that I'd like to make sortable and display as iso8601-formatted dates using the jquery.tablesorter plugin, http://links.d8u.us is what i have so far... and i can't figure out why it isn't allowing me to click on the columns to sort by them nor why it's showing me the timestamp instead of the human-readable date
[07:06:19] <hd1> which browser, l0uis?
[08:13:34] <kokut> Hello, is there an event listener or something for when elements get a new class or a class gets removed?
[08:46:38] <kokut> How do you check if an element has a class?
[08:46:45] <robertmaxrees> .hasClass()
[08:46:56] <kokut> thats it!
[08:48:32] <oste> i am noticing some strange results using $('#element').width()
[08:48:37] <oste> ever so often it just returns 1
[08:48:49] <oste> i am appending #element to the dom and then trying to get its width
[08:48:56] <robertmaxrees> does the element contain an image?
[08:49:43] <oste> no
[08:50:13] <oste> it is display: table-cell;
[08:50:36] <jarlopez> How can I set up an event listener for an element whose value is changed using .val() ?
[08:50:39] <jarlopez> (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20446948/why-does-jquery-val-function-not-update-attribute-value)
[08:51:05] <robertmaxrees> jarlopez you need to either .trigger() the change event after setting it using .val() or manually call the handler instead.
[08:51:35] <robertmaxrees> oste how are you adding the #element?
[08:51:38] <jarlopez> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[08:51:40] <robertmaxrees> is it via ajax or anything like that?
[08:51:43] <oste> nope
[08:51:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it  then.
[08:51:54] <oste> just .append(
[08:52:02] <oste> yeah it is display:table-cell i think
[08:52:07] <oste> removing that and i can't get it to fail
[08:52:29] <robertmaxrees> weird. wonder why that makes a different.
[08:52:32] <robertmaxrees> *difference
[08:53:51] <kokut> can you do something like $('p.classname') ?
[08:54:01] <robertmaxrees> kokut yes, but you should avoid that when possible.
[08:54:09] <kokut> why
[08:54:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a little slower.
[08:54:48] <kokut> but i'm not going to use it for complex stuff its just a simple menu ?
[08:55:24] <robertmaxrees> then have a class that's only used for that nav.
[08:56:33] <kokut> yea its only there for now
[08:56:49] <robertmaxrees> then just use the class.  if it's not descriptive enough, update it so it is.
[09:02:50] <noober03> i have the regex: var additional_wos= (($("input[name ^= 'work_order[" + wo_type + "'"))); that works in every browser except for Safari. Any ideas on how to change it to work with Safari?
[09:03:38] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a closing ]
[09:03:45] <robertmaxrees> actually, two closing ]
[09:04:35] <noober03> oh i see
[09:04:55] <ciss> i'm currently trying to figure out how to approach complex interfaces built upon jquery ui. mainly there are two parts that i'm unclear about: 1. how do i handle panes that contain multiple (nested) interactive elements - would i just nest widgets in this case, or should i go for a monolithic widget? 2. some ui classes seem to be purely presentational, while others appear to be used to assign behaviors (please correct me if this is wrong) - how can
[09:06:06] <noober03> i only want the closing one to match the left side of name, reason i don't want other one is that i can have random numbers after the work order: ex, work_order[new0], work_order[new1] ...
[09:06:24] <ciss> (background for 2.: i'm trying to limit custom css as much as possible, so that the interface styles rely on the ui theme that is used)
[09:07:30] <robertmaxrees> noober03 you don't have a choice.  you need to close both of those.
[09:07:52] <robertmaxrees> at least the out ones, i mean.
[09:07:57] <noober03> i just tried the single one and it worked. the other one doesn't matter since it is part of a string
[09:07:59] <robertmaxrees> and you might need to escape the inner [ with a \\
[09:08:10] <noober03> thanks for your help
[09:08:21] <robertmaxrees> also you've got two extra () around that fwiw :)
[09:08:42] <noober03> ok thanks, i am new to jquery so i appreciate the help
[09:08:42] <ciss> noober03: you might also want to look at http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[09:09:34] <noober03> ciss: thanks for the link
[09:38:03] <kokut> whats the parent of this?
[09:38:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:39:01] <ciss> kokut: as in parentNode?
[09:39:15] <robertmaxrees> you can do $(this).parent();
[09:40:05] <kokut> yea
[09:40:25] <kokut> how do you remove every element that contains 'class' from the DOM?
[09:40:34] <robertmaxrees> $('.class').remove()
[09:40:41] <kokut> its not working
[09:40:58] <ciss> kokut: that contains a specific class or that contains any class?
[09:41:14] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ kokut
[09:41:14] <b-ot> kokut: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:41:55] <kokut> its not working as its not removing every element that contains the class,only the first one
[09:42:28] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something weird.
[09:42:39] <kokut> yea this freaking thing is extremely weird
[09:42:48] <kokut> freaking bootstrap tabs
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cejjrf33/
[09:58:20] <adamh> Anyone used this http://hilios.github.io/jQuery.countdown ?
[10:01:32] <robertmaxrees> looks like quyite a few people have :)
[10:04:01] <Katronix> Greetings all, I hope this is the correct channel, I'm trying to use: http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-bootstrap-theme.html here: http://mjmagic.greensnakedesign.com/job3.php everything is working correctly except for the location field, was curious if anyone would be willing to see what I screwed up? I can't figure it out :(
[10:05:21] <robertmaxrees> Katronix i'm seeing a JS error on pageload 0- might want to fix that up first.
[10:05:37] <Katronix> okay
[10:05:39] <robertmaxrees> you're also missing a doctype - i'd clean up your sample page and make sure it's valid first.
[10:07:09] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, try setting up your example in a jsfiddle
[10:08:24] <Katronix> robertmaxrees: were you referring to the Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery error? or a different one?
[10:08:32] <robertmaxrees> that'd be the one.
[10:08:38] <robertmaxrees> and your lack of a valid page.
[10:11:55] <robertmaxrees> also what's up with that extra closing ul tag?
[10:13:13] <Katronix> fixed the page type, its odd bootstrap keeps complaining about not having jquery loaded, even when I move it to being directly after the line that loads jquery.
[10:13:49] <robertmaxrees> you have two copies of bootstrap on that page.
[10:16:23] <Katronix> okay all of those errors fixed :) issue still remains :(
[10:20:07] <robertmaxrees> try setting removeRows: to true
[10:20:31] <robertmaxrees> something about this isn't adding up - selecting dropdown items is doing something.
[10:21:06] <robertmaxrees> it's appending those things to the list, instead of hiding the things you don't want.
[10:22:37] <Katronix> robertmaxrees: yes, that is the issue I was having
[10:23:49] <adamh> wow thanks for your help robertmaxrees
[10:24:16] <Katronix> robertmaxrees: thanks! that was the issue :)
[10:33:45] <notchris> Any ideas why I might be getting this error:  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined ?
[10:34:07] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to call "split" on something that doesn't exist.
[10:34:43] <notchris> robertmaxrees: And you’re right
[10:34:45] <notchris> Haha
[10:34:46] <notchris> Thanks man
[10:36:09] <ratbuddy_> hiya, let's say I have something like 	$('#form').change(function(event){     can I call this event when something else changes as well? do I just need to name the function?
[10:36:28] <robertmaxrees> either that or use event delegaion.
[10:36:33] <robertmaxrees> or both.
[10:36:37] <DeltaHeavy> I'm using grunt-contrib-jshint and I'm getting an error (included as a comment). What's the best way to go about resolving this error/warning while not disabling the rule as I want to enforce the use of strict mode in JS - https://www.refheap.com/99282
[10:36:55] <ratbuddy_> will rtfm on event delegation thanks robert
[10:37:29] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy try wrapping in double quotes instead of singles?
[10:40:28] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Doesn't help, the issue is strict mode isn't enabled for the or statement in the parameter passer (what's the correct name for that?)
[10:40:31] <DeltaHeavy> The    MODULES || P{
[10:40:38] <DeltaHeavy> MODULES || {}        I mean
[10:42:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[10:42:58] <notchris> If I’m using jquery to check something about a div one Page 1
[10:43:07] <notchris> And I want to check that same info on Page 2
[10:43:16] <notchris> Can I load the div without it becoming visible
[10:43:22] <notchris> so I can still run the script and get the information
[10:43:32] <notchris> It’s a calendar
[10:43:48] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy somebody in ##javascript might know.  my gut says you have to make "use strict" the first statement in the entire file but that seems hacky and like it'd cause headaches.
[10:44:12] <robertmaxrees> notchris that's hacky - why not change things so you're loading data elsehwere into the page and reading from there in both cases?
[10:44:12] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Asked  there first. The issue with putting that on the global scope is it will effect all 3rd party libs too.
[10:44:25] <DeltaHeavy> JSHint will complain about 'use strict'; in the global scope too.
[10:44:26] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy if you concat, right?  if you don't, you're safe?
[10:44:33] <robertmaxrees> i could be w- ah.
[10:44:37] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I don't believe so...am I wrong?
[10:44:47] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue hahaha.  i'd have ot play with it.
[10:45:08] <notchris> robertmaxrees: True
[10:45:53] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: It will all be concatted and stuff anyway
[10:46:38] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy no clue then.  since you're already using jshint i almost want to tell you do not worry about use strict to much and let jshint do your yelling for you
[10:47:08] <sacho> lame.
[10:47:14] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, "use strict", not 'use strict'
[10:48:27] <sacho> I really dislike it when people talk about tools "complaining". :|
[10:48:37] <robertmaxrees> haha why is that?>
[10:49:24] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, actually, I can't reproduce your issue with jshint.
[10:52:40] <notchris> Once I use .load
[10:52:48] <notchris> To load a div into another div
[10:53:03] <notchris> Why can’t I then pull information from that div?
[10:54:26] <sacho> what makes you think you can't
[10:54:26] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[10:54:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess you have event listeners bound to the contents of that div.
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> which won't work.
[10:55:13] <oste> back with my width issues again
[10:55:20] <sacho> ok, and I'll hedge my bet on $.load(); doStuff();
[10:55:36] <oste> noticing that if i refresh the page it works normally - but opening in a new browser aka target="_blank" causes the issue SOMETIMES
[10:55:39] <robertmaxrees> sacho ooh that's another one.
[10:56:01] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://rocketb.in/paste/NzYJ3X
[10:56:14] <robertmaxrees> yep, sacho was right.
[10:56:16] <notchris> I’m loading a div from one page into #data-cal (which is hidden)
[10:56:41] <robertmaxrees> notchris any code that relies on the ajax call needs to be in its done() calback.
[10:56:55] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Ahhh
[10:56:56] <robertmaxrees> .load().done(function() { /* your code here */ });
[10:57:22] <notchris> Thank you robbieSti
[11:00:38] <notchris> Still getting an issue robertMeeting hmm http://rocketb.in/paste/gXE39R
[11:03:23] <notchris> nm got it
[11:06:48] <ciss> re my earlier question: every little piece of information helps. don't be shy. ;)
[11:07:53] <ciss> i think i've found some solid resources regarding the classes, so the one question that remains is point 1, the handling of complex interfaces with (nested) jquery ui widgets
[11:12:39] <jwmann> Would input's 'pattern' attribute be considerd to be a property or attribute by jQuery? I'm having a very hard time comprehending the difference even after reading many blogs/posts about it.
[11:20:03] <cj> what's a better way to write w.appendTo(z); x.appendTo(z); y.appendTo(z); ?
[11:21:33] <cj> jwmann: heh, me too.  I think properties might be boolean attributes, ie the ones that don't need a ="..." to be valid
[11:21:42] <cj> but valid is a pretty squishy word
[11:21:58] <jwmann> cj: Yea that's was the feeling I got from it.
[11:22:40] <cj> I like to throw an explicit ="true" on to the end of for instance disabled
[11:22:47] <cj> does that make it an attribute?  Do I care?
[11:23:00] <jwmann> Haha
[11:23:05] <jwmann> I do the same
[11:23:30] <cj> I get the feeling they've got a junior person on the dev team who hasn't quite got it figured out themselves.
[11:24:12] <cj> you got any tips on my above question?
[11:24:19] <cj> what's a better way to write w.appendTo(z); x.appendTo(z); y.appendTo(z); ?
[11:25:08] <cj> foreach my $e ( qw( w x y ) ){ print( "$e.appendTo(z)"; ) }
[11:25:17] <cj> I'ma' boutta do that.
[11:27:20] <jwmann> Em, not quite sure without context but this could work $.each( ArrayOfObject, function() { $(this).appendTo(z); });
[11:33:54] <tasaif> cj: http://jsfiddle.net/w1b1z2sf/
[11:34:45] <sacho> jwmann, attributes - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input  properties - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement
[11:35:26] <sacho> jwmann, generally, attributes are those things you write in html -> <input type="text" pattern="xyz"> <-- attributes
[11:36:55] <sacho> properties are part of the dom object created for that html, e.g. input.name, input.pattern...and so on. Properties hold the element's state(so they are meant to change). Sometimes attributes have a corresponding property.
[11:37:44] <sacho> if in doubt, the answer is probably "use a property"
[11:37:48] <DeltaHeavy> sacho: Sorry I was pulled away. I'll look into single vs double quotes for strict mode. Also yeah, I can't reproduce it on jshint's website but I'm using a Grunt plugin that makes use of it's API so ti's throwing this error. Wondering if it has to do with me being on a Windows machine and the newline characters being different.
[11:38:07] <jwmann> sacho: Okay, so attributes are what's written, property are part the DOM object itself
[11:38:29] <sacho> jwmann, in all cases I can think of, the dom uses properties, not attributes.
[11:38:59] <jwmann> sacho: In what case would I ever use .attr() then?
[11:39:24] <robertMeeting> if you're reading a relative href(), attr() can be helpful.
[11:39:29] <robertMeeting> *href
[11:40:39] <cj> thanks, tasaif.  I was thinking I'd user an array ref.
[11:40:55] <jwmann> robertMeeting: Wouldn't .prop() be able to do that?
[11:41:32] <DeltaHeavy> sacho: Why double quotes over single quotes for 'use strict';? The EMCA spec says I can use both - http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_14.1
[11:41:39] <robertMeeting> jwmann .prop() and .attr() return two different values in those cases ;)
[11:41:48] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, I was guessing jshint had a poor implementation, but apparently not.
[11:42:03] <DeltaHeavy> sacho: Gotcha
[11:42:23] <DeltaHeavy> Wondering what the scope of strict mode is when declared at the top of a file...is it for all of that file or is it global?
[11:42:32] <DeltaHeavy> Or regarldess I'll be minifying so it would be bad either way =/
[11:42:37] <robertMeeting> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
[11:42:39] <robertMeeting> this tells you ;)
[11:42:50] <jwmann> robertMeeting: Ah okay, so attr() would return "/myrelative/path/to/this/site"and prop() would return "http://mywebsite/myrelative/path/to/this/site"
[11:43:00] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, for all the code from then on
[11:44:08] <robertMeeting> jwmann yep
[11:44:57] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Was looking through there briefly. Took some time now and found my answer. Thanks!
[11:45:14] <DeltaHeavy> But yeah, I need to concat. Really hope I just don't have to tell everybody to ignore this warning lol.
[11:45:30] <robertmaxrees> why not just enforce the rules through jshint itself?
[11:45:49] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Enforce the rules meaning what?
[11:45:55] <DeltaHeavy> Linting my code through their website?
[11:46:10] <robertmaxrees> errr...
[11:46:41] <robertmaxrees> we have a CI system that checks each PR and we don't merge if code isn't passing hint.
[11:47:22] <robertmaxrees> so you can configure your jshint config to enforce those rules and then make that a no-merge condition for code review.
[11:47:42] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: That's what I'm doing except right now it's just printing reports. Going to do more work on it later to actually reject errors but not warnings but log it all.
[11:48:02] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: But I want to enforce the use of strict mode but this wonky error is mucking it up =/
[11:48:26] <robertmaxrees> then you're going to have to hack around it.
[11:48:59] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Yeah, trying to figure out how without making the code disgusting is the tricky part =/
[11:54:54] <tasaif> cj: np, credit to jwmann 11:27
[12:33:43] <oste> i am noticing an issue with code like this https://jsfiddle.net/aop08h6c/
[12:34:03] <oste> i cannot reliably get the width of #test
[12:34:16] <oste> when the browser opens the link in a new tab it fails sometimes
[12:34:23] <oste> just refreshing the page works everytime
[12:34:44] <oste> it is as if the table-cell element has not grown to 100% width yet
[12:38:42] <oste> planning to use a faux element that is not display:table-cell for this calculation - but ouch
[12:39:38] <NoiseEee> oste: what?
[12:39:56] <oste> NoisEee did you see the original issue
[12:40:02] <oste> https://jsfiddle.net/aop08h6c/
[12:40:42] <oste> sometimes the width for #test returns as 1
[12:41:03] <NoiseEee> yeah but i guess im confused to a) why there's an inline style set  b) why that inline style make no sense (setting one <td> in a row of others to 100% width)  and c) why you need to know the width
[12:41:04] <oste> only when i open the page in a new tab
[12:41:19] <NoiseEee> what problem are you trying to solve?
[12:41:45] <oste> well this is very simplified but the same exact thing i need to do in my plugin
[12:41:52] <oste> calculate the width of a table-cell
[12:42:15] <NoiseEee> well assuming the DOM is ready, there's no reason why .width() shouldnt work
[12:42:22] <oste> i agree
[12:42:49] <oste> sadly it does not work as expected SOMETIMES
[12:43:14] <oste> ^ the worst kind of bug
[12:43:54] <NoiseEee> i suppose
[12:44:51] <oste> no it is.
[12:45:04] <oste> guaranteed
[12:47:37] <oste> daaamn, maybe it's b/c my url ends with /
[12:47:54] <oste> it only happens when clicking this link to open in a new tab
[13:01:32] <NoiseEee> doesnt really make sense
[13:17:42] <oste> i think this issue is chrome only
[13:17:58] <oste> and i have isolated it down to just a simple <div></div> and $('div').width();
[13:18:16] <oste> width will return 0 sometimes
[13:18:42] <oste> even though the div really does take up space
[13:18:57] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[13:19:05] <oste> again this only happens in a new tab target="_blank"
[13:19:30] <oste> robertmaxrees does fiddle allow target="_blank"
[13:19:34] <oste> just refreshing works everytime
[13:19:58] <robertmaxrees> you could target="_blank" to a fiddle that has the bad code?
[13:20:00] <robertmaxrees> not sure.
[13:20:18] <oste> it is really that simple
[13:20:20] <oste> 2 lines
[13:20:23] <oste> add a div to the page
[13:20:27] <oste> and try to calculate its width
[13:20:36] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:20:49] <oste> yes
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> then the setup i described should be easy to create ;)
[13:21:05] <robertmaxrees> if you've found a bug, you'll need it anwyay
[13:21:05] <oste> well i don't think fiddle works that way
[13:21:19] <robertmaxrees> prove it then.
[13:22:28] <oste> http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:22:29] <oste> bwhaahah
[13:22:57] <oste> http://jsfiddle.net/08c6dvnq/
[13:23:12] <oste> works fine on fiddle :/
[13:23:23] <robertmaxrees> can you share the page that it's broken on?
[13:23:54] <robertmaxrees> you checked to make sure your page is valid?  only loading jq once?  etc.
[13:24:42] <oste> oh yeah
[13:24:49] <oste> i cannot share the page unfortunately
[13:25:01] <oste> working to isolate down even further
[13:25:12] <oste> i really think this is related to target="_blank"
[13:25:15] <oste> in chrome
[13:25:21] <robertmaxrees> i have doubts, but OK.
[13:27:53] <oste> yeah its something really bad happening
[13:30:13] <oste> http://pastie.org/10076981
[13:30:27] <oste> create a link to this using target="_blank"
[13:30:34] <oste> the first log will be 0
[13:30:38] <oste> the second will be correct
[13:30:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid page fwiw
[13:30:51] <oste> well
[13:30:57] <oste> add a header and html tags haha
[13:31:00] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:31:48] <oste> wehre is paul irish?
[13:31:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:31:57] <oste> this has cost me a day
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing the work you need ;)
[13:37:26] <robertmaxrees> oste http://stackoverflow.com/a/22932139/923919 not the exact same thing, but i wonder if iut's related.
[13:43:35] <oste> yeah that seems similar
[13:46:50] <oste> so i have to physically set the width?
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot.  fwiw i was able to trivially reproduce in chrome.
[13:47:12] <oste> statically*
[13:47:24] <oste> thanks
[13:47:30] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual underlying problem you're trying to fix?
[13:47:35] <oste> thats it!
[13:47:42] <oste> i need the damn width of a div
[13:47:47] <oste> that is issue enough
[13:47:54] <oste> i cannot get the width of a div
[13:47:56] <oste> cmon
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[13:48:10] <robertmaxrees> like, is there a way around this?
[13:48:14] <oste> no
[13:48:19] <oste> its a fluid div
[13:48:21] <oste> i need to know the width
[13:48:47] <oste> pretty awesome

[14:06:33] <robertmaxrees> jquery ticket?

[14:07:47] <oste> i even tried offsetWidth
[14:07:55] <oste> jquery is off the hook i think
[14:09:44] <ericandrewlewis_> I'm doing an XHR request in JavaScript and would like to parse the response HTML with jQuery.
[14:10:05] <ericandrewlewis_> I'm confused how to make a traversable DOM object from a fully formed HTML string ('<html>....</html>')
[14:10:46] <ericandrewlewis_> I'm trying to get an attr val of an element, but the element is in the <head> of the document.
[14:11:25] <ericandrewlewis_> I can easily access elements in the <body>. I believe $(theHtml) is truncating the contents to just the body because of how $() works.
[14:13:47] <robertmaxrees> ericandrewlewis_ what happens if you do $(theHtml).find('head') ?
[14:14:33] <robertmaxrees> also, check out http://stackoverflow.com/a/6417439/923919

[14:22:16] <TheBritishBloke> I'm trying to use .each to go through <li> items that have a certain class. When using .each(function(index)), the index is just the index of the list items with class, so it always starts at 0. Is there a way to make the index have 0 be the start of the entire <ol> ?
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:23:50] <TheBritishBloke> $('ol').each(function(index){
[14:23:54] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah, you want the index of the li, relative to the <ol>
[14:23:54] <TheBritishBloke> Whoops.
[14:24:06] <TheBritishBloke> Yeah precisely. Sorry, it's late. Brain's not working properly, haha.
[14:24:12] <robertmaxrees> $(this).index();
[14:24:38] <TheBritishBloke> Sec I'll give it a go.
[14:25:24] <TheBritishBloke> Well I'll be damned. I figured that wouldn't work for some reason. I think it's too late to be doing this haha.
[14:25:31] <TheBritishBloke> Thanks very much, and sorry for my idiocy.
[14:25:42] <robertmaxrees> nah, not a problem :) we all get stuck sometimes.
[14:50:30] <kokut> Hello, can you check onmouseleave if the pointer has entered some element?
[14:50:49] <robertmaxrees> not in the way you're thinking.
[14:51:43] <kokut> the thing is i have a lil arrow ">" added at the end of an element on hover but i don't want it to be removed if he client is not in top of another element
[14:52:15] <robertmaxrees> then only .remove() it when you have a mouseenter on another element.
[14:53:24] <kokut> i already tried that and it didnt work out
[14:53:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Locwbmjx/
[14:53:32] <robertmaxrees> done.
[14:54:53] <kokut> holy shit robertmaxrees
[14:54:59] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:55:07] <kokut> you just made me feel really stupid
[14:55:12] <kokut> xD
[14:55:41] <kokut> if you knew all the trouble i've gone through trying to make that work
[14:56:06] <robertmaxrees> gotta keep it simple :)
[15:01:37] <robertMeeting> could also do it this way http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Locwbmjx/1/
[15:05:53] <Emn1ty> hey, we're getting an issue where when you dismiss an alert box over a sortable element, it selects that element (and puts it into a drag state). Has anyone heard of this before?
[15:06:51] <TheBritishBloke> Interesting. Is that when the OK button is above the element?
[15:07:24] <Emn1ty> yeah, and it happens both on click and when hitting return
[15:09:51] <Emn1ty> i mean, we can just not use an alert but it's certainly an odd occurence
[17:53:48] <jwmann> I have an element with 3 classes. "MyElement" "Foo-Bar" "Foo-Bar-Special". I need to change that element's "Foo-Bar-Special" class to "Foo-Bar-Super" without being able to select "Foo-Bar-Special" specfically, kinda of like "Foo-Bar-*" or something, would it be easier to remove all of the classes and rebuild it? Or somehow select that extra class and switch it?
[18:20:45] <Rou> Hi

[18:29:04] <javascriptius> hi
[18:40:11] <xp_prg2> hi all, I need to alter the contents of a div but I want it to keep its class values
[18:40:26] <xp_prg2> I am using .innerHtml right now but that causes the div to lose its class values
[18:41:18] <xp_prg2> would I use the .text() function?
[18:44:56] <se_busca_ayuda> xp_prg2, why not .attr?
[18:45:14] <se_busca_ayuda> or .val(newvalue)
[19:21:13] <Verzlo> Mike you there?
[19:45:08] <jwmann> Does the .each() method only run once or something?
[20:05:22] <javascriptius> Is anyone aware of a javascript database library where I can store javascript objects?
[20:06:09] <rcyr> javascriptius: You could take a look at the "LocalForage" library from Mozilla
[20:06:21] <javascriptius> cheers rcyr :)
[20:08:50] <javascriptius> rcyr: have you heard of PouchDB before?
[20:09:35] <kevireilly> javascriptius: basically every database with JSON.stringify ;)
[20:10:04] <rcyr> javascriptius: Nope
[20:16:34] <sgronblo> Why is there a :input extended selector? Won't input "just work" with querySelector?
[20:24:41] <Sinauth> Hello, I have my jquery menu working fine on my main pages (http://www.chandlercomputers.co.uk) but I am trying to include it on my store (http://www.chandlercomputers.co.uk/store) I just can't get the sub menu's/ subtoggle to work. Any idea's?
[20:33:57] <creativename> oi
[20:34:18] <creativename> can anyone explain the difference between the two examples after the first?
[20:34:20] <creativename> http://jsfiddle.net/AMsK9/
[20:34:46] <creativename> i want to make a script the remembers the coordinates and places a marker there
[20:34:55] <creativename> was thinking of using 2 or 3 as a base
[20:37:03] <wemini2> i have a function that calls an ajax function.. before i call the ajax function i want to update the contents of a div
[20:37:25] <wemini2> however jquery waits for the ajax to complete.. i don't want to wait however.. any idea how to do it right away?
[20:37:41] <wemini2> my call to change the div is before .ajax
[20:54:37] <TeddyMurray_> wemini2, if its inside the callback function it will run after the ajax call
[20:54:59] <TeddyMurray_> if it's after the ajax call then it will run immediately, but no guarantee it will run before or after
[20:55:13] <wemini2> TeddyMurray_ it's actually before the ajax call altogether
[20:55:30] <TeddyMurray_> could you pastebin?
[20:55:34] <wemini2> i even just added a timeout around the ajax call, and put it in a separate function. hm
[20:57:22] <TeddyMurray_> its doing $.html("new stuff"); ?
[20:57:27] <TeddyMurray_> right before $.ajax?
[20:57:29] <wemini2> yes
[20:57:32] <wemini2> TeddyMurray_ http://pastebin.com/P4gPy5fV
[20:59:02] <TeddyMurray_> okay by using each, you are queueing callback functions to be called later..thinking of a solution
[20:59:50] <TeddyMurray_> try putting the ajax call inside an if statement that says if x equals the length of the files array then call the ajax function
[21:00:02] <TeddyMurray_> that's the only hack i can think of that will work
[21:00:32] <wemini2> i see
[21:00:35] <wemini2> hmm, i can do it without each
[21:00:43] <TeddyMurray_> yeah, or do a for statement
[21:00:49] <TeddyMurray_> that's probably better
[21:14:00] <aro> has anyone done anything like the google plus page scroll?
[21:34:48] <jeffreylevesque> I'm wondering if i could use hadoop to distribute large data, and redis for caching.  does that seem reasonable?
[21:34:50] <jeffreylevesque> or, would one choose one or the other?
[23:54:43] <cyberbrai> hello everyone
[23:55:18] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/vngx/kk1kmrbu/2/
[23:55:33] <cyberbrai> How to depend more than 2 <select> items on each other?
[23:56:18] <Cork> cyberbrai: bind the change event on both and check both elements in the same event
[23:56:46] <cyberbrai> Cork I tried some thing like that actualluy not bind but no success
[23:57:11] <cyberbrai> As you can see that What I want is when I change value in any of three then values in all should be affect.Now whats happening then values select in other two "empDepartment" and "empSubDept" are change but reverse is not working mean If I change values in "empCategory" then value in the "empSubDept" should also change
[23:58:01] <Cork> cyberbrai: yes, and you do that by binding one event handler that listens to all the select elements
[23:58:05] <Cork> and modify all except it self
[23:58:16] <Cork> (this)
[23:59:06] <cyberbrai> Not getting plz can you done in my fiddle not so much know about bind
