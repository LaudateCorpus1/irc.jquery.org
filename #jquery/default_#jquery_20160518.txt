[02:05:59] <JavaLover> i need to talk to an expert
[02:06:02] <JavaLover> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.load
[02:06:20] <JavaLover> if(jQuery.isFunction(params)){ //we assume it's a function}
[02:06:39] <JavaLover> is this really how jquery works? making random assumptions about a data type that should represent data?
[02:42:03] <PCatinean> Hey guys, how does one search the first parent of the element that is a div with class x?
[02:42:40] <PCatinean> I see only closest works not parent
[02:52:58] <Kartagis> PCatinean: $(elem).closest('div.x')
[02:53:26] <PCatinean> Kartagis, I always wondered what happened if there is a child with that description that is closer but you would only want a parent :(
[02:53:29] <Cork> PCatinean: closest searches parents not siblings and the like
[02:53:37] <PCatinean> Cork, children no?
[02:53:41] <Cork> no
[02:53:45] <Cork> only parents
[02:53:57] <Cork> well it searches the current element, and then parentNode
[02:54:01] <PCatinean> ah...awesome...but then why does the parent accept a argument, only to select IF the parent is that value
[02:54:11] <Cork> yes
[02:54:23] <PCatinean> :)
[02:54:24] <Cork> if the parent doesn't match you get nothing
[02:54:34] <Kartagis> Cork: does $(elem).closest('div.x').find('foo#y') work?
[02:54:56] <Cork> ya, except you can just do $('#y') as id's are unique
[02:55:11] <Cork> and don't prefix ids with an element name
[02:55:19] <Cork> (for the same reason)
[02:56:15] <Kartagis> right
[05:00:37] <ycon_> Hi all, I'm trying to Hide a div when another gets shown (on the same click). Where have I gone wrong? $("#showLogobox", "hideSigbox").on("click", function(){$("#logobox").toggle();
[05:04:20] <ycon_> Here's another attempt; trying to show & hide separate div's wihtout success- http://dpaste.com/38MNMMG
[05:14:53] <Cork> ycon_: make a jsfiddle.net
[05:15:04] <konrados> ycon_ but what is happening, I don't see any issues in your code
[05:15:06] <Cork> and include the element your dealing with
[05:15:08] <ycon_> All good- I got it. Had a div inside a div
[05:15:18] <Cork> ah
[05:16:19] <ycon_> I am trying to make a moving zoom
[05:23:07] <lambda2>  test
[05:26:55] <ycon_> Cork: I should explain better- I'm trying to use a movable/resizable box to zoom in
[05:26:56] <ycon_> http://codepen.io/yarnball/pen/EKzdax
[05:27:36] <Cork> ycon_: there are ready made plugins for image zoom if you want to use them
[05:27:49] <ycon_> Cork: that can do so with a box?
[05:28:05] <Cork> well they do on hover
[05:28:12] <Cork> (you don't have to drag it)
[05:28:27] <Cork> it's quite common
[05:28:36] <ycon_> Yep, I've seen it. What I'm doing isn't common
[05:28:58] <Cork> it looks like it
[05:29:01] <Cork> http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2013/07/jquery-image-zoom.html
[05:29:09] <Cork> 25 versions ^ :)
[05:30:16] <ycon_> Cork: not how it needs to work tho. I need to be able to resize and drag a box (it's for touch devices as well)
[05:30:49] <Cork> well resize is a bit different
[05:30:55] <Cork> touch support isn't though
[05:31:33] <ycon_> Is what I'm trying particularly complicated?
[07:14:09] <ircbaako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/ how will i get the value relating to each of the table rows?
[07:25:26] <Kartagis> ircbaako: what value?
[07:25:37] <Kartagis> which one?
[07:26:29] <ircbaako> Kartagis, basically which ever radio button is checked i want to get the value for the input field when the "confirm card" button is clicked
[07:39:05] <berpcor> Hello. I am watching Jeffrey Way's videos about jQuery. And I have some questions.
[07:39:20] <berpcor> I am learning defereds now.
[07:40:35] <berpcor> Why do I need resolve and reject methods? Why I can't use .done and .fail?
[07:41:00] <berpcor> done and fail for $.ajax
[07:41:53] <Duikb00t> [ [ offtopic ] ]  Someone an idea of a good Google Maps libary which could help me to achieve something like this: https://dribbble.com/shots/2425958-Travel-Service-UI/attachments/470800  ? :)
[07:42:17] <berpcor> I understand that when method is useful as it allows to know when all async operations done. I can't do it using done/fail.
[07:43:40] <berpcor> But what should I use: deferreds or sone/fail - for stand alone async operation?
[07:43:46] <berpcor> *done
[07:48:09] <sp1rs> Hi

[07:54:54] <sp1rs> select the date and then try clicking the button
[07:55:07] <sp1rs> it wont toggle
[07:55:58] <berpcor> I click the button -> datepicker shows. I choose date -> datepicker disappears.
[07:56:09] <berpcor> What's wrong?
[07:57:20] <sp1rs> berpcor: what if i want to choose the date again
[07:58:09] <berpcor> sp1rs: I don't understand your problem ) I can choose it multiple times...

[08:11:52] <eynix> Hi
[08:12:25] <eynix> I'm noob, trying to access an html elem with a date as id. seems inconsistent ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0c5a2a9032472d525824d7071fde9a04
[08:14:24] <YamakasY> berpcor: ?
[08:17:02] <eynix> in short : $("#20\\/05\\/2016") -> OK
[08:17:29] <eynix> $("#"+(new Date).toLocaleDateString().replace(new RegExp("/", 'g'), "\\\\/")) -> " Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression"
[08:17:59] <eynix> but for me it's doing the exact same thing
[08:26:45] <shoky> berpcor: resolve/reject are for resolving or rejecting a deferred that YOU created (not for one that was created by jquery, e.g. by $.ajax).  calling resolve on your deferred will resolve it, and cause it  .done() handlers to be called. (while .reject will cause its .fail handler to be called)
[08:27:22] <shoky> berpcor: so e.g. the only reason your .done() handler for $.ajax gets called, is because internally jquery is resolving the deferred it created
[08:27:54] <shoky> so resolve/reject are totally different than done/fail, totally different purpose
[08:28:52] <shoky> and.. you CANT call resolve/reject on what $.ajax returns anyway. (its a promise, a subset of a deferred that someone else will resolve/reject)
[08:29:18] <eynix> So I resolved my problem using : $(document.getElementById((new Date).toLocaleDateString()));
[08:29:34] <eynix> but I still don't get why it wasn't working
[08:31:41] <shoky> eynix: because you put too many slashes
[08:32:03] <shoky> too many backslashes, that is
[08:32:42] <eynix> shoky: since it produce the same string, I don't understand. What was the correct way to do  ?
[08:33:20] <shoky> eynix: it doesn't produce the same string.  try this in your console:  console.log( "#20\\/05\\/2016" );   console.log( (new Date).toLocaleDateString().replace(new RegExp("/", 'g'), "\\\\/") );    see the difference?
[08:33:41] <shoky> well, disregarging the # at front
[08:33:51] <eynix> >> "20\\/05\\/2016" ==  (new Date).toLocaleDateString().replace(new RegExp("/", 'g'), "\\\\/")
[08:34:09] <shoky> wrong
[08:34:28] <shoky> when you write a literal string,   2 backslashes become one
[08:34:50] <eynix> I must be stupid today
[08:34:51] <shoky> but when you're creating a string not literally, you need to add only 1 backslash
[08:34:54] <shoky> it's confusing.
[08:35:08] <shoky> but try what i said.. write this in your console:
[08:35:09] <decx> woualdnt toLocaleDateString be different for every language
[08:35:26] <eynix> (new Date).toLocaleDateString().replace(new RegExp("/", 'g'), "\\\\/")  -> "18\\/05\\/2016"
[08:35:28] <shoky> console.log( "18\\/05\\/2016" );   console.log( (new Date).toLocaleDateString().replace(new RegExp("/", 'g'), "\\\\/") );
[08:35:33] <shoky> write that EXACTLY in your console ^
[08:35:42] <eynix> but "18\\/05\\/2016" == (new Date).toLocaleDateString().replace(new RegExp("/", 'g'), "\\\\/") -> false
[08:35:43] <shoky> you'll see the difference.  there's not much more i can explain
[08:35:46] <shoky> stop using ==
[08:35:49] <eynix> I'm so fck*ng lost x)
[08:35:49] <shoky> log to the console
[08:36:05] <shoky> you'll see 2 DIFFERENT strings.
[08:36:10] <eynix> no
[08:36:12] <eynix> I don't
[08:36:18] <eynix> screening
[08:36:52] <shoky> there..  https://i.imgur.com/NDj6zqq.png
[08:37:05] <shoky> the date is switched cause of my locale, ignore that
[08:37:11] <shoky> but one has  one backslash
[08:37:13] <shoky> the other has 2 backslashes
[08:37:46] <decx> see i told you
[08:37:53] <eynix> shoky: http://python-web-eylith.c9users.io/images/test.png
[08:38:08] <shoky> eynix: you did not log what i told you to
[08:38:12] <decx> just collect all relevant divs and filter
[08:38:18] <shoky> eynix: and as you can see, it's FALSE
[08:38:27] <eynix> yes I can see that
[08:38:33] <shoky> eynix:  log both of the strings and you'll see the difference.
[08:38:46] <eynix> that's it I'm done for today.
[08:38:50] <shoky> seeya
[08:38:53] <eynix> thanks shoky :)
[08:39:00] <shoky> np
[08:39:28] <eynix> shoky: the two strings was displayed, if it's what you mean by logged
[08:39:43] <eynix> shoky: and seems the same, I'll compare the two char by char
[08:39:44] <shoky> eynix: what i said is very simple.  log both strings. see the difference.
[08:39:52] <shoky> eynix: see my screenshot........
[08:42:18] <eynix> shoky: ok get it, thank you (didn't see the "write that EXACTLY in your console", just did)
[08:43:52] <shoky> cools
[08:47:53] <ircbaako> shoky, can you help plz
[08:48:03] <ircbaako> https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/ how will i get the value relating to each of the table rows? basically which ever radio button is checked i want to get the value for the input field when the "confirm card" button is clicked
[08:51:49] <shoky> ircbaako: give the inputs a class e.g. "ccInput",  give your rows a class too e.g. "row".  then in your click handler you can do  $(this).closest('.row').find('.ccInput').val()
[08:52:11] <shoky> that's a robust way to do it
[08:53:23] <shoky> ircbaako: alternatively you can just do  $(this).prev().val()  because curretnly your inputs are right before the buttons.. but that's not a good way to do it and will stop working as soon as you modify your html a bit
[08:57:13] <ircbaako> shoky, thanks should the button have an id or class? the think is those information on the jsfiddle are not static
[08:57:36] <shoky> ircbaako: a class.  id's must be unique
[08:57:59] <ircbaako> they are generated on requested e.g. if the user have 1 or 100 cards saved they will get 1 - 100 of those
[08:58:49] <shoky> that's fine.  you should probably use a delegated click listener, on some container element,  instead of attaching a click handler to each single button
[09:00:09] <shoky> e.g.  $('#myTable').on('click', '.confirmButton', function() { ... })   if table has id myTable and buttons have class confirmButton
[09:00:38] <shoky> (see docs for .on()  for info about event delegation)
[09:01:11] <ircbaako> shoky, https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/1/
[09:01:48] <ircbaako> the matter of the radio button been checked
[09:02:08] <shoky> ircbaako: mmm that's not really valid html btw,  having  <tr> <div> <th> ..
[09:02:23] <shoky> ircbaako: also you're listening for click in the inputs...
[09:02:47] <ircbaako> yes just notice sorry
[09:02:48] <notchris> Oooo shoky
[09:02:59] <notchris> Dont put BS rows (assuming) inside table rows
[09:03:11] <notchris> Rows contain sections per BS doc
[09:03:23] <shoky> BS?
[09:03:52] <notchris> Bootstrap, sorry, it's like embedded in my brain that the row class applies to BS
[09:04:03] <shoky> oo
[09:04:04] <notchris> Either way, don't find the input via closest, I would do it via count
[09:04:15] <shoky> count..?
[09:04:26] <AwkwardCough> drakula
[09:04:29] <AwkwardCough> ^taplar
[09:04:31] <shoky> do find it via closest, don't listen to this guy ;p
[09:04:31] <notchris> Lolll
[09:04:49] <notchris> Thanks, just an opinion
[09:05:02] <notchris> If every input has a button as well
[09:05:06] <shoky> an opinion , to do it via count?  a non existing method?
[09:05:08] <notchris> You could just do it by count
[09:05:22] <notchris> eq, etc
[09:05:34] <notchris> and count is a term applying to items in repetition
[09:05:39] <shoky> why would you do messy and bug-prone counting when you can do a simple .closest().find()
[09:06:41] <notchris> You can do it either way, I'm just suggesting a method that makes more sense to me
[09:06:48] <notchris> I respect your opinion though
[09:06:55] <shoky> you should learn other ways, then :P they are better
[09:07:01] <notchris> That's subjective
[09:07:06] <shoky> not really
[09:08:54] <taplar> non positional based logic is 99% always preferred for stability
[09:09:08] <AwkwardCough> a count would not be as efficient I imagine. plus there is a bunch of variables you would additionally need to maintain where you are
[09:09:08] <notchris> ty taplar
[09:09:28] <taplar> uh, that was agreeing with shoky
[09:09:38] <ircbaako> shoky, https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/3/ thanks i just notice also when i dont checked the other radio button and click on confirm card, i am still getting console
[09:10:07] <notchris> That's positional
[09:10:14] <notchris> You're saying find the closest positioned input
[09:10:16] <taplar> closest().find() is relational
[09:10:21] <taplar> eq() is positional
[09:10:32] <notchris> If every input has a button
[09:10:42] <notchris> Then input referenced can be referenced by the button count
[09:11:00] <notchris> Rather than being like, "lets search the html for something that might exist somewhere around here"
[09:11:29] <taplar> i did say 99%, :)
[09:11:52] <notchris> ;)
[09:12:48] <taplar> i'm late to the party though.  this example confuses me.  confirming an input that is open for edit
[09:13:09] <shoky> ircbaako:  $('.confirm_card')  finds ALL elements with that class. and doing .is(':checked')  checks if ANY of those elemnts are checked. not what you want, i guess?
[09:13:34] <shoky> ircbaako: and yea it doesn't really make sense.. why have the radios AND the buttons?
[09:13:55] <notchris> isn't it just input:checked
[09:13:56] <shoky> or,  why check the radio when the button is clicked
[09:14:05] <shoky> no
[09:14:06] <notchris> or is is is(":checked")
[09:14:17] <shoky> both do the same more or less
[09:14:24] <notchris> jquery api recommend :checked
[09:14:30] <ircbaako> shoky, good point.
[09:14:44] <ircbaako> shoky, i know why
[09:15:19] <ircbaako> if to make sure if a user accidently click on the button
[09:15:27] <taplar> my confusion is mainly from existing websites I've seen.  typically adding new cards and choosing existing cards are different interfaces
[09:15:30] <ircbaako> the are sure the want to process with that
[09:15:48] <ircbaako> they*
[09:15:58] <shoky> ircbaako: it'd be better to only show the button for the row that is checked, no?
[09:16:00] <notchris> I hate when sites save cards
[09:16:05] <taplar> ^
[09:16:07] <shoky> why show buttons on non-checked rows, if you can't click them
[09:16:10] <notchris> I wonder if you can be PCI compliant and save cards
[09:16:12] <ircbaako> in our focus group we found that some users were feeling out all the card info
[09:16:29] <ircbaako> thinking they were going to verify all the card at once
[09:16:30] <notchris> PCI Compliant refers to the security of the server?
[09:16:35] <shoky> notchris: you can, but it's much more work if you want to save them
[09:16:36] <notchris> Or the script?
[09:16:44] <taplar> i fill out my card info all the time, except for a couple that auto saved my card without asking
[09:16:45] <notchris> shoky: Ahh
[09:16:54] <shoky> notchris: refers to the overall security of anywhere the card info is passed through
[09:17:00] <notchris> Most DB's I've seen only keep the last 4 digits for reference
[09:17:04] <notchris> shoky: Ahh I see
[09:17:15] <notchris> I always wondered what that applies to exactly
[09:17:26] <shoky> the whole shebang ;p
[09:17:37] <taplar> yeah, which can be a pain in the azz
[09:17:45] <taplar> if you have an app on the same network that cc's pass over
[09:17:51] <taplar> some of that is forced on you
[09:18:07] <notchris> We use a company, but in turn, they dont have an open payment gateway
[09:18:18] <notchris> So they basically forced their clients to use the system
[09:18:26] <ircbaako> what i am trying to do here is if the user change their shipping address they should reverify their card. same thing amazon does
[09:18:58] <notchris> I'd be nervous coding something dealing with cards
[09:19:17] <ircbaako> notchris, thats why you have payment gateways
[09:19:25] <ircbaako> you dont save the card in your server
[09:19:25] <shoky> notchris: that's good :)
[09:19:26] <notchris> I know
[09:19:34] <taplar> paypal!
[09:19:38] <ircbaako> you just collect the info and pass it to the gateway :D
[09:19:46] <notchris> Yeah but you have to do it securely
[09:19:52] <notchris> Otherwise you can be in deep sh*
[09:19:56] <notchris> +t
[09:20:06] <ircbaako> notchris, https :D
[09:20:07] <AwkwardCough> or just have a single guy who manages all card information and users have to verify it thru him
[09:20:18] <notchris> AwkwardCough: Yas.
[09:20:18] <taplar> bob
[09:20:21] <notchris> BOB
[09:20:26] <notchris> His name was....
[09:20:30] <taplar> you now him too?
[09:20:31] <taplar> fk
[09:20:32] <shoky> him name is
[09:20:36] <notchris> He was in a club with me
[09:20:38] <notchris> Pretty rough.
[09:21:07] <ircbaako> shoky, back to the topic please. That is why i need that radio
[09:21:27] <shoky> damn. just remember this oldie favy. i'll just drop this here sry  http://www.lostfrog.org/
[09:21:37] <shoky> remembered*
[09:21:45] <shoky> ircbaako: oks as you wish ;p
[09:22:26] <AwkwardCough> lost frog was not liam neesons best movie
[09:23:04] <shoky> !
[09:23:24] <AwkwardCough> ircbaako: you said that the users would be filling out all the multiple card info at the same time?
[09:25:14] <ircbaako>  AwkwardCough nope
[09:25:41] <ircbaako> i said without the radio user in the focus group where feeling out all the card info
[09:25:54] <AwkwardCough> ah
[09:26:29] <taplar> so, when they verify their card, do they have to re-enter it?
[09:27:11] <ircbaako> taplar, yes so if you have changed your shipping address to a new one that we dont currently have on our database for you. we need you to enter your card number again
[09:27:18] <ircbaako> similar to what amazon does
[09:28:18] <taplar> -_-
[09:28:42] * AwkwardCough is explaining credit card fraud prevention to taplar
[09:28:56] <taplar> to which i said i'd just make them enter in the 3 digit security code
[09:29:07] <taplar> which would not be saved
[09:29:38] <taplar> but idk.  outsider looking in
[09:30:25] <AwkwardCough> ease of user experience -vs- card protection
[09:30:45] <taplar> 2-3 failed attempts at security code, lock the card.  kill the brute force
[09:31:42] <AwkwardCough> lock the card, or at that point make them re-enter the full card info before locking the account and logging them out and sending emails to the correct people
[09:32:32] <taplar> so i'm the real user, and i fat fingered the code, now i have to enter everything again?  vs just locking and getting the alert that maybe i need to change my account pass?
[09:34:03] <AwkwardCough> idk man differences, in security preferences i guess :/
[09:34:50] <taplar> that was another curious thing about the example
[09:34:54] <taplar> who has 100 cards?
[09:35:22] <notchris> Who doesn't
[09:35:26] <notchris> lol i kid
[09:35:29] <AwkwardCough> hey no judgement here man
[09:35:54] <notchris> Still need to get a chip on my card
[09:35:56] <AwkwardCough> who doesnt have a 100 card payment system of multiple cards paying the debt of other card to raise your credit score?
[09:36:23] <taplar> i'd like a chip.  but I also really like what one bank does.  maybe bank of america, i forget
[09:36:30] <taplar> but they have a random cc# generator
[09:36:47] <taplar> so you request it, it generates a one time valid cc# that you can use on any website
[09:36:50] <notchris> I don't think you can raiser you credit score that way
[09:37:04] <taplar> lol, nah.  but from a security standpoint for internet transactions
[09:37:09] <AwkwardCough> not with that attitude you cant
[09:37:19] <notchris> Lol, I guess
[09:37:26] <notchris> Been chill around 800 for like 2 years
[09:38:17] <taplar> i've no clue.  i was frauded a few years back so i'm probably not back to the best yet
[09:38:28] <notchris> That sucks, sorry to hear
[09:38:52] <taplar> yah, doesn't affect me much, but i know it's out there, :)
[09:39:00] <notchris> I'm using my main card to finance a new Accord, I feel like that's keeping my levelled out
[09:39:09] <notchris> Those sh*ts are only like 20k tho
[09:39:27] <taplar> nice, almost as cheap as a smart car, :)
[09:39:58] <notchris> And half the smug!
[09:40:05] <ircbaako> taplar, the payment gateway i am using is stripe it does not support the 3 digiti cvc code
[09:40:06] <taplar> lol
[09:40:19] <taplar> egh
[09:40:21] <ircbaako> digit
[09:40:23] <notchris> Is there another kind of cvc code?
[09:40:26] <notchris> I honestly dont know
[09:41:20] <ircbaako> its better i ask for the card number because the 3 digit cvc is easy to remember while the long card number isn't
[09:41:51] <notchris> You cant run the card without the CVC though
[09:41:57] <notchris> or the correct address / name etc
[09:42:00] <notchris> p sure
[09:42:07] <notchris> Expiration..
[09:42:08] <ircbaako> notchris, with stripe you can
[09:42:13] <notchris> Really though?
[09:42:16] <notchris> Without expiration?
[09:42:17] <ircbaako> all you do is generate a ran cvc code
[09:42:41] <ircbaako> then compare the finger of the card with the original card
[09:42:45] <ircbaako> and see if the match
[09:42:56] <taplar> hold on
[09:43:03] <ircbaako> the only time the charge for cvc is when you try to charge the card
[09:43:12] <ircbaako> the only time the valid for cvc is when you try to charge the card
[09:43:13] <taplar> finger?
[09:43:25] <ircbaako> fingerprint
[09:43:32] <taplar> actual fingerprint
[09:43:54] <taplar> so is this like for some kind of payment system on smart phones?
[09:43:58] <ircbaako>  taplar 1 sec
[09:44:25] <ircbaako> taplar, thing of the fingerprint has a generated number which is always the same
[09:44:40] <ircbaako> for the card number
[09:45:00] <taplar> so a real fingerprint
[09:45:09] * taplar is intrigued
[09:45:09] <ircbaako> so card number 4242424242424242 fingerpring might be 7edjdjjfdjdjfdjfuud
[09:45:23] <ircbaako> it will always be 7edjdjjfdjdjfdjfuud
[09:45:32] <taplar> so not a 'finger' print
[09:45:39] <taplar> that's what i'm interesting in, :)
[09:46:08] <ircbaako> an example taplar
[09:46:09] <ircbaako> http://kopy.io/BIZQK
[09:46:13] <ircbaako> line 12
[09:46:31] <taplar> lol, that doesn't tell me anything
[09:46:57] <ircbaako> thats the fingerprint for Jane Austen credit card
[09:46:57] <taplar> i'm invisioning a person pressing their finger to an iphone or something and it capturing their fingerprint as data to associate with a credit card.  yes/no?
[09:47:19] <taplar> *envisioning
[09:47:28] <ircbaako> taplar, ask #stripe ahaha
[09:47:45] <ircbaako> i dont know how it works with the iphone fingerprint
[09:48:04] <taplar> so your saying that is what they're doing?
[09:48:09] <ircbaako> i am not using that figure for my app yet though stripe support it
[09:48:25] <ircbaako> feature not figure
[09:49:43] <ircbaako> i dont know how stripe handle card numbers but once you give it to them you will NEVER KNOW what the number is
[09:50:01] <ircbaako> but they will tell you the card "fingerprint" aka the unique id for the card
[09:50:34] <ircbaako> so if you ever pass the same card number again e.g. 4242424242424242
[09:50:57] <DreamStiffler> Hi guys
[09:51:04] <ircbaako> the fingerprint akak the unique id will forever until the world ends be KUIaQP5OEgLx1vWZ
[09:52:07] <taplar> DreamStiffler: yo
[09:52:15] <ircbaako> so when you ask the user to confirm their card number what you do is ask stripe to generate the unique id aka the fingerpint again then you compare it with original fingerprint
[09:52:20] <taplar> we're just blabbing.  if you got a q, shoot
[09:52:56] <DreamStiffler> Templar too full maybe later jyst sayin hi
[09:54:14] * taplar is a knight now
[09:54:20] <notchris> Wooo
[09:56:50] <ircbaako> shoky, are you still around
[09:57:59] <shoky> ircbaako sorta, but others here can answer you just as well
[10:07:47] <ircbaako> guys https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/5/ how do i only run the confirm card for the radio that has been selected?
[10:11:22] <taplar_meetings> so..... why have multiple buttons then?
[10:11:43] <taplar> think someone asked that earlier
[10:12:02] <ircbaako> taplar, to verify the card you want to use
[10:12:19] <taplar> you specify the card based on the radio, yes?
[10:12:34] <ircbaako> taplar, me and use can think normally but they are hundreds of different disabilities
[10:12:54] <taplar> lol, that doesn't help a disability
[10:13:05] <taplar> *multiple buttons that is
[10:13:16] <ircbaako> so people can accidently fill in all input field without knowing they only need to fill 1 in
[10:13:30] <taplar> how does multiple buttons help that
[10:13:43] <taplar> provided you just said you only want to verify the one with the radio selected
[10:13:43] <ircbaako> we only need you to verify 1 card that is all
[10:14:21] <ircbaako> taplar, yes
[10:14:29] <ircbaako> which is what i want do
[10:14:32] <taplar> so you radio the one you want to verify and click a single button at the bottom or top.  which then finds which one to verify based on the radio
[10:14:42] <ircbaako> verify for the with the CHECKED radio button
[10:14:50] <ircbaako> verify for the one with the CHECKED radio button
[10:14:56] <taplar> right....
[10:15:05] <taplar> we're agreeing
[10:15:11] <taplar> so why multiple buttons?
[10:15:33] <notchris> ircbaako: https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/o47rg0sd/6/
[10:16:05] <saberu> what's wrong with this ajax call? http://pastebin.com/ZLNCC82E
[10:16:11] <ircbaako> notchris, ?
[10:16:24] <ircbaako> taplar, so you verify for the one you want to use
[10:16:34] <taplar> which you choose with the radio
[10:16:40] <taplar> no need for multiple buttons
[10:16:50] <ircbaako> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/7/
[10:16:57] <notchris> ircbaako: That's what u wanted
[10:16:58] <taplar> it just clutters the page and can lead to misunderstandings about usability
[10:16:59] <ircbaako> this is why i have multiple buttons
[10:17:27] <taplar> that's not a reason.  again.  your choosing which one to verify with the radio.  you don't need multiple buttons
[10:17:36] <ircbaako> taplar, some users have more than 1 card saved for example me i have 8 cards saved on amazon
[10:18:16] <ircbaako> if i every changed my shipping address amazon will ask me to verify only ONE of those cards
[10:18:37] <ircbaako> their layout is similar to the one in that jsfiddle
[10:19:10] <taplar> so if i'm a user and i choose a radio for one credit card
[10:19:17] <taplar> and then i click the verify for another credit card
[10:19:19] <taplar> what happens?
[10:19:31] <ircbaako> taplar, if i dont have muliple button and someone accidenly fill out all those and click on the single button the QUESTION is which card do you then charge?
[10:19:49] <taplar> the one with the radio chosen!
[10:20:09] <taplar> otherwise what's the point of the radio?
[10:20:45] <ircbaako> taplar, long story short is they a way to do what i want to do or not?
[10:21:03] <taplar> i'll let someone else help you make your crazy ui/ux work
[10:21:37] <taplar> imho your cluttering your screen and introducing a point of confusion to your users
[10:22:43] <AwkwardCough> ircbaako: https://jsfiddle.net/o47rg0sd/9/
[10:24:08] <ircbaako> taplar, your opinion is valid dont get me wrong and its good that you for me seeing it in that point of view
[10:25:43] <taplar_meeting> just want you to make life easy for yourself and your users, ;)
[10:25:54] <taplar_meeting> more for your users, :P

[10:40:04] <DreamStiffler> Ok guys im on android
[10:40:30] <DreamStiffler> Is there such thing as first letter tgen tabbing names to reply to a person?
[10:40:51] <DreamStiffler> Irc related before i get to my jquery question
[10:41:49] <DreamStiffler> Ook while waiting for that heres my jquery question. I dont have jfiddle as im on train now and on mobile
[10:42:35] <DreamStiffler> In my body tags there are multiple divs...children grandchildren sibling etc
[10:43:11] <DreamStiffler> And undere these divs there are images with same class name...lets say "superimages"
[10:44:36] <DreamStiffler> What i want to do is on submit, get the size of the containing div of the images and then add it as attr into the image(s)
[10:44:56] <DreamStiffler> How do i do this?
[10:47:09] <DreamStiffler> Because on load...the images are sized according to the containing divs. But as i submit the images expand to its original size. This happens in outlook. The fix is to have the dimensions hard coded onto the images tag
[10:47:37] <DreamStiffler> @taplar r u still around?
[10:51:20] <DreamStiffler> @taplar_meeting any help
[10:51:57] <DreamStiffler> !ping
[10:54:35] <DreamStiffler> Anyone here?
[10:55:52] <DreamStiffler> Oh hello
[10:56:47] <DreamStiffler> Is it me youre looking for
[10:57:02] <DreamStiffler> Taplar_meeting
[10:58:47] <DreamStiffler> Bim bim bap
[10:59:38] <oste> is $.Deferred() removed from jQuery version 2?
[10:59:49] <DreamStiffler> Ircbaako
[11:00:09] <DreamStiffler> Oste help me out pls
[11:01:07] <ircbaako> DreamStiffler, what have you tried
[11:02:44] <ircbaako> AwkwardCough, do you guys work in the same place?
[11:02:48] * taplar enjoys meeting hump day
[11:02:56] <taplar> he's my pair partner, :)
[11:03:03] <AwkwardCough> indeed, he is in spitting distance
[11:03:13] <taplar> frequently
[11:03:24] <DreamStiffler> What? Me?
[11:03:30] <DreamStiffler> Spitting?
[11:03:57] <DreamStiffler> I dont have my pc with me but i tried some thing like...
[11:04:25] <DreamStiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/LK3QX/
[11:04:33] <DreamStiffler> Found online
[11:05:12] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[11:05:38] <DreamStiffler> Not exactly what i want but similarly. Didnt quite work. Because the images didnt have any attributes after submit
[11:07:41] <DreamStiffler> Ok imagine under tge body tag. There are multiple divs. And under each of them are none ir more divs. None of them or some of them are similar in structure. And in some of these divs (in child or grandchild or furter down) has images.
[11:08:48] <DreamStiffler> I want to get the size/dimension of each images container div and add .attr tothe images
[11:09:41] <taplar> so if an image is 200x300 you want to put width="200" and height="300" on the image?
[11:09:41] <DreamStiffler> So if there are 10 different sized images. I want it all have attributes of height and width according to each owns containing div
[11:10:20] <DreamStiffler> Currently these images doesnt have dimensionattributes. Its sized accirding to the containibg div
[11:10:42] <DreamStiffler> Yes..taplar.autimatically in one function or so
[11:10:56] <oste> new $.Deferred() stopped working for me in v2
[11:11:41] <DreamStiffler> I tried earlier using something like http://jsfiddle.net/LK3QX/ but thr images didnt get any attributes
[11:11:53] <DreamStiffler> That link i got off google
[11:11:57] <taplar> oste: i believe that is a factory.  i don't think you need 'new'
[11:11:58] <DreamStiffler> Wasnt mine
[11:12:26] <Xatenev> oste: var deferred = $.Deferred();
[11:13:10] <oste> still does not work
[11:14:17] <orestis> Hello everyone. I am a bit new to jquery. I'm having an issue with some code I need to work on: There's a dropdown with a function populating the options, using the key - value pairs of a JSON file. However, once an option is selected, only the key appears: http://pastebin.com/MG98wsVs
[11:14:18] <oste> TypeError: $.Deferred is not a constructor(…)
[11:14:19] <oste> js_lqZrQreRokALGu6TUlTn3OQNd3eC7XqIygYOtTAk7G8.js:2 Blocks Enabled *********
[11:14:40] <oste> whoops, just that first one
[11:15:13] <oste> or TypeError: $.Deferred is not a function(…)
[11:16:08] <taplar> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/LK3QX/48/ this?
[11:16:34] <taplar> oste what do you get if you do console.log($)
[11:16:47] <DreamStiffler> Gimme a few mins pls ill check now
[11:18:00] <oste> function(j,s){return new b.fn.init(j,s)}
[11:18:14] <taplar> and if you do console.log(jQuery) ?
[11:20:36] <oste> same thing
[11:20:56] <taplar> ok, so yeah var deferred = $.Deferred();  should work
[11:21:17] <oste> it certainly not work haha
[11:21:21] <taplar> what version?
[11:21:23] <oste> working*
[11:21:32] <oste> i think it is 2.1.4
[11:22:07] <Xatenev> oste: var deferred = jQuery.Deferred();
[11:22:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jdm1yaw5/
[11:24:22] <oste> taplar where is the jQuery version?
[11:24:42] <taplar> in the javascript window there is a javascript selectable tab in the top right corner, click that
[11:25:01] <oste> thanks
[11:25:12] <oste> damn, idk then. this is on a minified asset
[11:25:17] <DreamStiffler> How do i view source on chrome android
[11:25:22] <oste> something must be messed with that
[11:25:31] <oste> might just need to wrap this bit in a try catch
[11:25:58] <Xatenev> oste: how does a try catch help you when you wanna use Deferred? :D
[11:26:14] <oste> if it fails just do what i was gonna do anyway
[11:26:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jdm1yaw5/1/ using minified version
[11:26:31] <oste> actually the real solution is to remove jQuery
[11:26:35] <oste> using imagesLoaded in fact
[11:26:37] <taplar> jQuery is working
[11:27:07] <oste> https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/blob/master/imagesloaded.js#L106
[11:27:23] <taplar> take off the new
[11:27:27] <oste> tried it
[11:27:30] <taplar> that is not what we've been pasting
[11:27:34] <taplar> it's a factory, new is not needed
[11:27:40] <oste> i am trying that locally
[11:34:26] <DreamStiffler> Taplar not quite it. Try viewing http://jsfiddle.net/LK3QX/51/ the images should have width of 50 30 and 20
[11:35:09] <taplar> please use console.log instead of alert
[11:35:43] <taplar> ah, ok
[11:35:50] <taplar> so you want to apply the container dimensions to the image
[11:36:44] <DreamStiffler> Taplar yes. I cant have console as im not sure how to view from my phones google browser. Im on edge connection so plsbear with me
[11:37:10] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/LK3QX/53/
[11:39:46] <DreamStiffler> Great taplar exactly. Thank you. I hope this can be applied to what im doing. Can only try tmrw. Thanks a lot. Btw its for outlook email. Somehow it doesnt respect the css set.
[11:40:00] <DreamStiffler> Taplar mwahhhs
[11:40:05] <taplar> :)
[11:40:21] <DreamStiffler> Ok now i go and try to understand it
[11:40:23] <DreamStiffler> Bbl
[11:43:28] <Xatenev> taplar: hellyeah disappeared :O
[11:43:44] <taplar> oh?
[11:50:16] <DreamStiffler> Awesome. Its so easy when its in front of me. Guessneed to script them all again and again to remember
[12:50:15] <RattyWork> Hey, does anyone know how to display child rows on pre-exisiting data? For example: https://jsfiddle.net/ffhgm6Lm/1/
[12:50:25] <RattyWork> This is for data tables.
[12:50:58] <robertmaxrees> woah what's with the alert?
[12:51:06] <RattyWork> The alert is the problem
[12:51:31] <RattyWork> I have a <tr><td>TEST</td><td>TEST</td></tr> in there and it dislikes it
[12:51:56] <RattyWork> Sorry, was trying to potray the error.
[12:51:59] <taplar> yep, cause it doesn't match
[12:52:31] <taplar> datatables doesn't play nicely with mismatching tables and/or (col/row)spans
[12:52:33] <RattyWork> Is there a way to change that so I can do what I am proposaing
[12:52:43] <taplar> throw in some empty tds to make it match
[12:53:17] <RattyWork> Hmmmm… I wonder if I could do colspan=“5” and still do that
[12:53:26] <taplar> i just said it doesn't like those...
[12:53:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:53:47] <taplar> it wants a plain, simple, grid
[12:55:21] <RattyWork> Bah, damn.
[12:55:37] <taplar> such is the plugin you chose to use boss, :)
[12:56:21] <RattyWork> ;p
[12:56:35] <RattyWork> Thanks taplar

[13:05:14] <nindustries> Hi, anyone familiar with jstree ?
[13:05:31] <robertmaxrees> nindustries if you have a question, just ask - if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:06:48] <robertmaxrees> having an example on jsfiddle will increase your chances of getting help.
[13:07:32] <nindustries> Well i'm having problems populating the tree from JSON. Live URL: https://datapeak.hazcod.com/files/
[13:07:41] <nindustries> it doesn't error anything in the console
[13:07:47] <nindustries> so I'm rather lost on where to look
[13:07:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:08:05] <nindustries> The JSON is fetched, I can see in the success(..) call
[13:08:06] <robertmaxrees> can you at least point me to a line in a file or something to staret looking?
[13:08:16] <nindustries> :211 robertmaxrees
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> in what file?
[13:08:28] <robertmaxrees> (this is why fiddles are awesome)
[13:08:30] <nindustries> the page itself
[13:08:35] <nindustries> yeah, sec
[13:08:37] <nindustries> hm
[13:08:59] <taplar> 211 for me is a </li>
[13:09:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ same here.
[13:09:06] <robertmaxrees> just make a fiddle.
[13:09:13] <nindustries> sec
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> also: i don't see any xhr requests happening on that page.
[13:11:46] <taplar> script.js has a ton of doc readies...
[13:11:51] * taplar is browsing
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> heh.  yeah, i'ma wait for that fiddle :)
[13:14:36] <nindustries> hm, where is that share button
[13:14:49] <robertmaxrees> hit "save" and then copy the page url.
[13:15:23] <nindustries> Right :) https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/
[13:15:35] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:15:40] <robertmaxrees> not how you use jsfiddle lol.
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:16:23] <nindustries> Didn't the older version work like this?
[13:16:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/1/
[13:16:35] <robertmaxrees> you might be thinking of jsbin.
[13:16:41] <nindustries> oohhh
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't include script tags or a body or anything.
[13:16:47] <nindustries> right
[13:16:58] <nindustries> yup, it was jsbin
[13:17:04] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[13:17:13] <taplar> json.data doesn't exist
[13:17:22] <taplar> or it's a blank string
[13:17:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, empty array.
[13:17:38] <nindustries> hm
[13:17:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/2/
[13:17:45] <nindustries> ah, right
[13:17:46] <nindustries> sec
[13:18:07] <nindustries> It's because the rest page is authenticated
[13:18:25] <nindustries> fixed
[13:18:36] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[13:20:02] <nindustries> I'm not a JS developer, so I apologize in advance ;)
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> heh, the moment you want to work on the web, you become one ;)
[13:20:53] <taplar> i dislike this.... "api"
[13:21:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah this plugin seems really complicated.
[13:21:17] <nindustries> Yeah, I thought I was the only one thinking this :P
[13:21:26] <nindustries> I just want a filetree
[13:21:40] <taplar> jstree will do it, we use it
[13:21:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/3/
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> bad config
[13:21:50] <taplar> i'm just too lazy to dig in our source and i'm browsing the api
[13:22:09] <robertmaxrees> https://www.jstree.com/api/#/?q=$.jstree.defaults&f=$.jstree.defaults.core.data
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> just need to read the docs.
[13:22:33] <nindustries> im confused
[13:22:40] <nindustries> then why the json_data plugin?
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> by?
[13:23:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:24:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any reference to a "json_data plugin" anywhere.
[13:24:23] <nindustries> In my src I mean
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> right - i dunno where you get that from.
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> *got
[13:25:06] <nindustries> alright: https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/4/
[13:25:14] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:25:19] <robertmaxrees> did you look at my example?
[13:25:50] <nindustries> I copied over the AJAX example from your docs link?
[13:25:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/5/
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> youy had a syntax error.
[13:26:10] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/xgbmsfhy/3/
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> but if they directly support ajax, use that.
[13:27:11] <nindustries> A syntax error? ugh, did not see one
[13:27:27] <robertmaxrees> keep your console open :)
[13:27:27] <taplar> you got your console open?
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> you were missing a closing curly.
[13:28:05] <nindustries> Yeah, just noticed it. I need sleep.
[13:28:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:28:08] <nindustries> Thanks for the help guys!
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:47:05] <NomadJim_> Does jquery have css files? The datatables.net CDN has it listed as: https://cdn.datatables.net/t/dt/jq-2.2.0,dt-1.10.11/datatables.min.css
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery.
[13:47:16] <robertmaxrees> that's datatables.
[13:48:39] <NomadJim_> Yeah, I'm just trying to find all the necessary jquery includes that a webapp might need to work and the main jquery 2.2.3 and ui 1.11.4 seems like the main things
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has css files.
[13:48:58] <robertmaxrees> but jquery don't require any.
[13:49:02] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't
[13:49:46] <robertmaxrees> This for a particular webapp?
[13:50:04] <NomadJim_> robertmaxrees:  thanks, i got it to work by including the jquery-ui script before datatables
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:53:36] <TecHNicaL> what is wrong with my code
[13:53:36] <TecHNicaL> http://pastebin.com/ayiNV3zL
[13:53:45] <TecHNicaL> returns
[13:53:45] <TecHNicaL> Error: Jquery*********************** was not called
[13:53:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid snippet so there's your first p[roblemn.
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> http://www.technical.lt/test.php does not return jsonp.
[13:54:34] <robertmaxrees> it returns json
[13:54:39] <robertmaxrees> so kill dataType: 'jsonp',
[13:55:14] <TecHNicaL> i need to post parameters to different page
[13:55:21] <robertmaxrees> page or domain?
[13:55:25] <TecHNicaL> domain
[13:55:29] <robertmaxrees> because jsonp doesn't fix that automatically.
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> and post or get?
[13:55:38] <TecHNicaL> post
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, jsonp doesn't fix that problem.
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> the other server needs to enable CORS for that particular endpoint.
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> be careful you don't just wholly enable CORS carte blanche though.
[14:19:34] <notchris> hey robertmaxrees hope you're doing well
[14:19:59] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[14:20:06] <robertmaxrees> i wish i was heh.
[14:20:08] <robertmaxrees> how're you?
[14:20:09] <taplar> it's spreading
[14:20:42] <robertmaxrees> heh, or continuing, as is my case.
[14:30:17] <notchris> robertmaxrees: sorry to hear man, im OK
[14:30:24] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I hope your day improves
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> it's less of a "day" thing and more of a "life" thing.  Just need time and for nothing else to go wrong.
[14:31:09] <robertmaxrees> but thanks.
[14:44:13] <Freefood> I have a selector which contains multiple element and i'd like to apply an action except one very specific element (which I aslo happen to have selected in another selector) How can I do such thing ?
[14:47:58] <taplar> apply an action, a binding?
[14:48:05] <Freefood> can i do something like .not(this) on my selector ?
[14:48:10] <taplar> yep
[14:48:49] <Freefood> btw taplar thx a lot for your help yesterday :)
[14:49:03] <taplar> wha'd i do?
[14:49:04] <Freefood> mySelector.not(otherSelector) should work ?
[14:49:11] <taplar> yep
[14:49:20] <Freefood> taplar: gave me an article for debouncing throttling
[14:49:23] <taplar> and you can give it a selector or an Element or jQuery object
[14:49:27] <taplar> ah, cool
[14:51:20] <Freefood> thx again cuz it works :)
[15:10:10] <groundup> http://jsbin.com/kehinaneqi/edit?js why do each of these loops log the same thing for the variable?
[15:16:59] <xnoxk> anyone can help me fixing this bugs while moving the magnifying glass? (it disappears) also I don't think it is magnifying the img properly when hover,  hints please. https://jsfiddle.net/bdhb3swy/4/
[15:34:12] <taplar> xnoxk: something with your css, the width of the div is only 200px
[15:35:01] <taplar> lol, you have width:200 in your css rule
[15:54:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bdhb3swy/6/
[15:54:30] * taplar beat boxes
[16:08:33] <decx> what have these boxes ever done to you
[16:09:22] <taplar> not my fault.  i have anger issues
[16:09:36] <taplar> they wouldn't let me think outside
[16:09:46] <decx> no
[16:09:48] <decx> don't go there
[16:10:25] <AwkwardCough> sorry guys i turn away for one moment and taplar is taking out his puns sorry sorry
[16:11:07] <taplar> this is true, awkward gets the brunt of them
[16:11:20] <taplar> i told him i was attracted to my coffee yesterday
[16:11:32] <taplar> it was hot!!!
[16:12:18] <taplar> and seriously, once you go black...
[16:12:24] <taplar> ohhh!  continuation!
[16:12:31] <decx> i like my coffee like i like my women, drowned in milk and served at 60°c
[16:12:59] <taplar> i like my jokes like i like my women
[16:13:03] <taplar> dirty
[16:13:19] <decx> i thought drawn out and followed by shocked gasps
[16:13:29] <taplar> who told you?!
[16:42:53] <z1haze> anyone know how to fix an issue where you show a form on hover but in firefox when you hover over the autocomplete inputs the div will disappear
[16:43:30] <z1haze> i found this http://jsfiddle.net/ymDTj/2/ but is there a better way?
[16:44:56] <replicator> hi, how can i selected specific data-*="val" ? i try with $('div [data-*="val"']).click(){} but...seems that doesn't work
[16:45:15] <robertLunch> you want to avoid selecting on data attributes in general if you can.
[16:45:18] <taplar> replicator: you should avoid selecting by attributes
[16:45:22] <robertLunch> :)
[16:45:29] <taplar> select on a class/id/tag and then filter down if you must
[16:45:40] <robertLunch> .filter() with a function
[16:46:03] <replicator> well, i want to make chess only with jquery and html, and i made data-cell=[0][0] and data-piece=WQ
[16:46:23] <taplar> none of what we said involves anything other than js and html
[16:46:27] <robertLunch> :)
[16:46:46] <robertLunch> and you can still use data attributes.  just use .filter() with a function in that case.
[16:47:05] <replicator> ok, so i will everytime run all over the class/id/tag and looking what data-* is?
[16:47:15] <taplar> you can cache your selectors
[16:47:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:47:25] <taplar> (and should)
[16:47:44] <replicator> ok, thanks
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> i assume the data-piece elements and data-cell elements aren't the same ones, right?
[16:48:58] <replicator> no
[16:49:53] <robertmaxrees> good
[16:52:43] <replicator> <robertLunch> you want to avoid selecting on data attributes in general if you can.
[16:52:47] <replicator> why?
[16:52:54] <robertmaxrees> because it's really slow and awkward.
[16:53:01] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are meant to store data.
[16:53:04] <robertmaxrees> not be selected on.
[16:53:18] <replicator> ok ty
[16:54:30] <robertmaxrees> elb <3
[16:54:38] <taplar> ?
[16:54:38] <robertmaxrees> really digging this platform right now.
[16:54:43] <robertmaxrees> elastic load balancer
[16:55:16] <taplar> cool
[16:55:56] <robertmaxrees> very.  i just launched a small project to our sites that calls out to a service i'm hosting on ELB and it's going swimmingly.
[16:56:46] <replicator> omg, u make me to delete a lot of code :\
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to delete very much.
[16:56:56] <taplar> .....yay?
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> just change some small things.
[17:10:10] <replicator> hmm i should really read about how to manage memory in jquery/javascript etc, is there any paper or smtng that u recommend me to read? (i google some to)
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about that.
[17:10:28] <taplar> just scope properly
[17:10:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:49:36] <kevireilly> replicator: something that might be of interest is reading about patterns that lead to memory leaks and how to avoid them
[17:51:04] <replicator> kevireilly, thanks
[18:21:33] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[18:21:53] <jangoh> wc back
[18:22:03] <robertmaxrees> i've been here for a while.
[18:22:22] <robertmaxrees> just watching elb and elasticache for a while to make sure things are OK.
[18:22:26] <jangoh> haha thought went for dinner
[18:22:36] <robertmaxrees> nah it's only 3:22 here.
[18:22:44] <robertmaxrees> in the afternoon.
[18:23:08] <taplar> poor bastard, two more hours for you.
[18:23:10] * taplar cackles
[18:23:12] <taplar> later all
[18:23:16] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[18:23:20] <taplar> ;)
[18:23:42] <jangoh> okey i might misread your one of msg
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[20:29:09] <spoonUltra> I was using anchor scrolling, but an anchored object isn't being scrolled to because it's top property is set to less than 0. What is a good workaround for an effect similar to anchor scrolling with the intent of scrolling the window above where the DOM loads?
[20:29:42] <robertmaxrees> you can't scroll that far up.
[20:31:05] <spoonUltra> It's impossible?
[20:32:47] <robertmaxrees> can you scoll there with the mouse?
[20:36:59] <arc_> if you want the page to start scrolled below the top of the document why don't you just do that instead of moving elements above the top of the document
[21:52:45] <sadtaco> If I have .bind('keydown keyup', function(){ ... }) in my function, how do I tell whether it was a keydown or keyup?
[21:53:35] <sadtaco> I guess event.type. I hope it's consistent :|
