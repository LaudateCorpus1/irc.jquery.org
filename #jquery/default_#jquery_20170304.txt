[01:30:20] <wtfsoncomeonson> is it possible in 8 hours for a brain to some how in some intuitive linguistic mechanics from previous knowledges of they entirity of the scope of the domaine etc, could jquery js be brought from kinda knowing to your level if any strategic approach was attempted within 8 hours
[01:30:46] <wtfsoncomeonson> is it possible to bring intuition of a language as such as javascript to find more patterns and more quickly understand it
[01:31:02] <robertmaxrees> you're asking if you can learn JS and learn it will in 8 hours.

[11:48:42] <silverdust> How may I convert a DOM object to string and keep the parent
[11:49:10] <silverdust> $element.html() would only take the contents and drop the parent element
[11:52:24] <silverdust> I found $elem.prop('outerHTML') to work just fine

[14:38:14] <printForever> what is used for when the user is switching input fields with TAB key?
[14:38:14] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/DjHph0xX
[14:38:21] <printForever> I had to add focus, blur and click
[14:38:33] <printForever> but I still have problem with the initial input field
[14:38:53] <printForever> it doesn't work as intended, other fields work nicely
[14:38:59] <printForever> I'm guessing because of initial state?
[14:40:38] <printForever> SOLVED
[14:40:55] <printForever> I had :hover on it that was missleading me
[14:42:23] <Woet> if only he knew about .on()
[15:28:18] <arup_r> when I have a handler like $(".giphies-img-groups .main-content").on('click', 'img', function (event) {}); Now using `event` object, how do I get the object $(".giphies-img-groups .main-content") inside the event handler function. I tried like `$(event.delegateTarget)` but it didn't give me what I wanted.
[16:52:36] <docmur> I have the followin ajax: http://pastebin.com/CPz7gwcn, and it's calling the right script nad getting the right response, BUT, it's always getting it in Error, even when status is 200
[16:54:44] <dglambert> hey can, I not define the function as the first param of the SetTimeout js function
[18:22:16] <Kadigan> docmur: how do you know it succeeds if you get error? try turning cache off (default is on).
[18:23:11] <Kadigan> Otherwise check that login-callback.php isn't returning HTTP/1.1 404 or any other code even on success
[18:24:04] <Kadigan> I once spent 30 minutes debugging everything -but- my PHP script, and it turned out I somehow forgot to put the error code into the IF() I had, and it was always returning an error. :-)
[19:25:06] <Moses777> hi I'd love some ajax help. just to point me in the right direction. I write some comments here with some of my code. https://hastebin.com/pagewaxoqi.js thing is that my variable doesnt get defined after ajax call even if I call a method (outside ajax function)
[20:55:57] <dglambert> Hey, I am looking for the criteria for ajax done and fail
[20:56:11] <dglambert> What would constitute a failure?
[21:04:49] <dglambert> I'm wondering if adding a 500 status code to the page I am returning would trigger failed
[23:39:54] <docmur> Ah, I would of figured .success would of checked for a 200 status code
