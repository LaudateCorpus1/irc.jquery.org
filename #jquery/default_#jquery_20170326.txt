[00:00:33] <pavonia> Hhm, no idea. Maybe the scripts aren't loaded properly?
[00:01:08] <rhelp_> could something be blocking the scripts from loading when running it locally? I dont have any firewall restrictions setup
[00:01:34] <rhelp_> seeing it work on jsfiddle is really drive me nuts now haha
[00:03:14] <unomystEz> need a recommendation for fast tracking learning jquery if I already know c,c++,python, etc. but not much experience with javascript. any good books or online resources?
[00:26:18] <unomystEz> is it considered poor form to update a whole chunk of html from an ajax response?
[00:26:43] <unomystEz> I just got it to work and I'm calling my flask backend that renders an html template and the page seems to be updating quite well
[00:27:13] <unomystEz> it's either that, or get a json object back with the data that changed and then update those individual elements which actually is a bit tedious
[01:01:28] <joobz> hey guys.. is there a good cross-browser way of downloading a file to the local browser and then running it (or at least providing a link the user can click to run it) ? I want to send an MSI / EXE file to the end user and either automatically run it or give them a prompt to run it after it's finished.. key part of this is to show the progress of the download whilst they are downloading the file
[04:53:57] <Cypris> using jq.drop, if i drop an element on a different container than what it was previously in, how can i determine that?
[04:55:25] <Cypris> err, mouseup, my bad
[07:32:55] <pcfreak30> why does this strip the text element? i need it to get appended to the dom. $('<div></div>').append($('<div class="current-account-avatar" data-href="" width="90" height="90" alt="" class="default avatar" /></div>ahsabdelrahman')).html()
[07:33:52] <Duikb00t-home> Ni hao
[07:36:05] <Duikb00t-home> I am trying to let my 2 'mix it up' instances work at 1 page ... for some reason it's just ignoring my selectors imo: https://jsfiddle.net/kmcm8wsc/5/
[09:10:13] <pavonia> pcfreak30: Don't use a selector for the text to be appended, just the plain text
[10:24:49] <unomystEz> I have a fairly large html fragment that I'm polling once a second from my backend.  I think it might be lighter to poll another endpoint which will let me know if the html fragment needs updating, then call the one that returns the html
[10:24:58] <unomystEz> this is using .ajax()
[10:25:31] <unomystEz> I'm fairly new to jquery, but to me it would make sense to reduce the load on my backend having to re-render once a second instead of only doing it when it needs to
[10:25:41] <unomystEz> I suppose I could cache it in my backend though
[10:26:06] <unomystEz> but i'm wondering what the cost in the browser would be to continually replace the html fragment even if it didn't change
[12:05:05] <pcfreak30> pavonia: i dont follow?
[12:16:03] <pavonia> pcfreak30: Just append('<div class="current-account-avatar" data-href="" width="90" height="90" alt="" class="default avatar" /></div>ahsabdelrahman')
[12:44:57] <pcfreak30> pavonia: i tried that
[12:45:35] <pcfreak30> o i see
[12:46:04] <pcfreak30> pavonia: but why does doing $('<div class="current-account-avatar" data-href="" width="90" height="90" alt="" class="default avatar" /></div>ahsabdelrahman') not keep the text node
[12:46:56] <pavonia> It's only parsing a single element, IIRC
[12:47:25] <pcfreak30> any way to do it without a parent div?
[12:57:04] <pavonia> I don't know
[12:58:59] <uskerine> hi, if I concatenate two $.ajax calls (not in parallel or nested, just two GET sequential calls), does second one waits until first is completed?
[12:59:10] <uskerine> or is $.ajax fully asynchronous?
[13:02:14] <pavonia> pcfreak30: Wait, you could use $.parseHTML, of course
[13:02:34] <pcfreak30> yea figured that out
[13:03:01] <pcfreak30>  var submenu =  $('.account-avatar .sub-menu').get(0).outerHTML;  var html = $('<div></div>').append($($.parseHTML(response)).after(submenu));  $('.account-avatar > a').html(html);
[13:43:59] <uskerine> I am struggling to find an error in javascript code: https://bpaste.net/show/15177c4b0a8a
[13:44:39] <uskerine> return paypal.rest.payment.create(env, client, {  transactions: [       <-- SyntaxError: missing ] after element list[Saber mÃ¡s]
[13:44:46] <uskerine> any help is welcomed
[13:45:54] <docmur> Hey, how do I get the nearest table row using onClick: http://jsfiddle.net/Q8KVC/2314/
[14:00:49] <pavonia> uskerine: You're using key/value syntax in an array
[14:05:09] <pavonia> docmur: Don't use the same id for multiple elements
[14:06:44] <docmur> Fair enough, but that doesn't solve the onClick question I have
[14:07:47] <docmur> NVM
[14:07:48] <pavonia> Well, that's the problem with the selector. Something like $("[type='button']") should work
[14:07:48] <docmur> just got it
[14:07:49] <docmur> :)
[15:36:13] <juinn> anyone about for a quick question please?
[16:03:23] <jacob144> Hello, I'm trying to figure out how to convert a timezone to another with Jquery, I just don't know how to do so as I'm very new to coding.
[16:04:51] <jacob144> Somehow I need to search my html page for a "time," find the visitors timezone information and convert the times.
[16:05:12] <jacob144> Allowing for Day Light Savings of course
[16:27:52] <Neo_122> hi
[16:28:03] <Neo_122> what about you talking here ?
[16:28:20] <Neo_122> all the same users here in all room :D
[16:44:05] <jacob144> well this is a chat room about Javvascript.
[16:52:53] <shoky> jacob144 if you have a specific question, more chance you'll get help. you can use jquery to get and set the text in the page, not for the timezone conversion
[17:01:02] <Neo_122> I'm javascritp expert )))
[17:39:01] <jacob144> Neo_122 you are? could you help me figure out how to convert times
[17:39:07] <jacob144> timezones
[17:39:13] <jacob144> ?
[17:39:42] <Neo_122> no
[17:39:59] <Neo_122> did not encountered with this
[17:40:24] <jacob144> oh
[17:40:27] <jacob144> okay
[17:40:37] <Neo_122> did not confronted )))

[18:36:34] <_sowwat> I have a decimal field, I'd like to force the comma to appear after first digit when the user is typing the value, i.e. user types '1000', then this becomes 1.000 automatically
