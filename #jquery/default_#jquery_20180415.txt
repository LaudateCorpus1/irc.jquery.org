[03:50:15] <silv3r_m00n> i am doing echo json_encode($config, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);  in php and  jQuery.getJSON  in javascript and i get this Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :  in console. whats wrong with it ?
[03:52:21] <Uhkis> impossible to tell without seeing any code
[03:53:38] <silv3r_m00n> Uhkis: this is how json looks, https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/5xgywRSMVS/
[03:54:02] <silv3r_m00n> its in a php $config variable on server side doing echo json_encode($config, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);  exit;
[03:54:16] <silv3r_m00n> and client side is jQuery.getJSO
[03:55:05] <silv3r_m00n> this is a really crazy error
[03:55:28] <Uhkis> tell your php-script to send json headers
[03:56:36] <silv3r_m00n> thats necessary ? okay wait
[03:57:27] <silv3r_m00n> Uhkis: the error still there. header('Content-Type: application/json');  echo json_encode($config, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);  exit;
[03:57:53] <Uhkis> then you'll need to show some code
[03:58:04] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/
[03:58:40] <silv3r_m00n> Uhkis: this is php code, https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/FNn3jXY7KH/
[03:59:02] <silv3r_m00n> Uhkis: this is js code, https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/xBgXKJ4N2d/
[04:00:32] <silv3r_m00n> Uhkis: oh sorry, that was cool, i was mistakenly loading the json output file via script tag somewhere
[04:54:46] <arunkumar413> Hi All
[04:55:12] <arunkumar413> to achieve a consistent view on both screen and print css layouts
[04:57:32] <Woet> arunkumar413: I agree.
[04:57:58] <arunkumar413> I mean, how to achieve a consistent view on both screen and print css layouts?
[04:58:06] <arunkumar413> similar to google docs
[04:58:31] <Woet> arunkumar413: is that a jQuery question?
[04:59:55] <arunkumar413> exactly not, but related to web development. I  didn't find any answer on the internet. So thought experts here might have some idea
[05:02:42] <Woet> arunkumar413: thats why we have #web
[05:02:56] <Woet> as well as #css
[05:14:17] <Azrael_-> hi
[05:14:19] <Azrael_-> is there a way i could combine a normal input-field as a search-field with a drop-down? (i want to provide a similar experience as the data-filter with excel)
[09:10:21] <fas3r> Hello,
[11:05:45] <irondew> Hello, is there any way to write it smarter: https://pastebin.com/9KwCpsfx   ?
[11:09:23] <pavonia> How are the #btnX and btnX_expand elements related in the document?
[11:09:59] <pavonia> Perhaps you could give them an extra class and install the handler on all elements with that class
[11:11:27] <irondew> pavonia: they are the same just the <p> under them in #btnexpand is different
[11:12:52] <pavonia> I meant if you can easily go from #btn to the corresponding _expand element
[11:13:25] <pavonia> Because you'd have to find the corresponding _expand from the handler then
[11:19:17] <RyansWorld> Yes try to DRY you code a little
[11:20:05] <RyansWorld> If you ever write a script and you find yourself repeating a lot of code, you can probably find a way to reduce it with functions etc
[11:21:02] <RyansWorld> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/8GbeW4Ia/
[11:21:32] <RyansWorld> also you might consider useing .on("click", fucntion(){. . .
[12:27:30] <z1haze> hi, couple questions: What is the best way to upload files with $.ajax and can you get the upload progress from $.ajax as well?
[13:41:04] <z1haze> how do you actually set the request headers with $.ajax?
[13:41:23] <z1haze> I have to set some specific things in the header otherwise it wont work
[13:44:59] <pavonia> Wasn't there a headers field?
[13:53:28] <z1haze> it sends some headers, but i guess this server requires some other stuff? I havent been able to figure it out, its not a typical webserver
[13:53:40] <z1haze> its a webserver thats built into a 3d printer on my network
[13:53:48] <z1haze> not sure what I'm doing wrong though
[13:54:57] <pavonia> Does it even accept XMLHttpRequests?
[13:55:17] <z1haze> well yeah
[13:55:34] <z1haze> it comes with a extremely basic ui that utilizes dropdown
[13:55:37] <z1haze> err, dropzone
[13:55:57] <z1haze> but you can actually create your own custom one, and upload it, etc.. which is what I've been working on, wanting to release it to the community of people who use this printer
[13:56:04] <z1haze> but the upload is giving me troubles
[13:56:35] <z1haze> can you see if anything stand out?

[13:57:59] <thanzex> Hi there! i've got a really big page ( ~20MB only html ) with tens of thousands of repeating elements, i need to count them but if i use jquery with `$("nameOfTheClass")` it returns only the very first element and `$("nameOfTheClass").length` just returns undefined. is there any way to count all the elements?
[13:58:11] <pavonia> z1haze: You don't set any header here
[13:58:15] <z1haze> it seems to work fine with dropdown, but i cant figure out what its doing differently
[13:58:52] <z1haze> the only difference in the header between mine and the working one is Accept: Encoding something and the browser tells me it cant set unsafe header
[13:59:16] <pavonia> thanzex: What is the exact command?
[13:59:45] <z1haze> and then the error i get is just a generic net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET
[14:00:06] <thanzex> pavonia: `$(".outer-cell").length`
[14:00:55] <z1haze> are they all rendered server-side?
[14:01:27] <thanzex> z1haze: if you're talking to me, no, it's a static file on my computer
[14:01:41] <z1haze> and not that its really my business, but a 20mb page sounds like a terrible plan :)
[14:01:54] <z1haze> might use some pagination?
[14:02:07] <thanzex> it's not really a page, it's a report that i need to do some work on and have no power on how it's made
[14:02:32] <z1haze> what is your end goal here
[14:02:45] <pavonia> thanzex: My guees would be the command is called before the whole DOM is built, but then I have no idea why it would return undefined
[14:02:48] <z1haze> $('.outer-cell') is the wrapper around all of these elements?
[14:02:58] <z1haze> he said its static
[14:03:23] <thanzex> z1haze count how many `.outer-cell` are in the z1haze
[14:03:34] <z1haze> are you using a doc ready wrapper?
[14:03:57] <thanzex> outer-cell is the wrapper arount all the elements i'm interested in
[14:04:27] <z1haze> and there's lots of .outer-cell elements?
[14:04:32] <thanzex> tens of thousands
[14:04:52] <z1haze> could you made a paste of a short snippet of the strcture
[14:05:02] <z1haze> beacuse if there's a lot of them, and you're using a doc ready wrapper.. it will return them
[14:06:50] <thanzex> the fact is that it's returning something, only the very first one though, and yet the length of the selector is undefined
[14:07:48] <z1haze> if .length is undefined its not returning anything except your query
[14:08:56] <pavonia> What does that mean?
[14:09:18] <z1haze> if you go to any page and just do $('.some-bullshit-here') its going to return you something
[14:09:36] <z1haze> try it in the dev console
[14:10:36] <pavonia> Yes, but you just said "if .length is undefined its not returning anything except your query". What does that last part mean?
[14:10:42] <pavonia> I've never encountered an undefined on .length
[14:11:15] <pavonia> The doc also doesn't mention it
[14:11:31] <z1haze> i dunno man im just guessing you havent shared anything people can help from
[14:11:41] <thanzex> https://imgur.com/eF5ZOOU
[14:14:16] <thanzex> pavonia it means that if i use only the selector it's going to return the very firs element, however, if i ask the length of what's returned by that very selector it returns undefined
[14:17:08] <pavonia> What JQuery version are you using? Any other plugins that might override parts of it?
[14:28:38] <thanzex> pavonia well, i managed to get the count using other tools, still i'm a bit confused
