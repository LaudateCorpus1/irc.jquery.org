[04:08:12] <TheWild> hello
[04:08:19] <thykka> hi
[04:09:37] <TheWild> $.post({ ... error: function() { });
[04:09:37] <TheWild> How I am supposed to obtain a JSON response in case of 403?
[04:10:13] <Cork> TheWild: you would have to ask for responseJSON from the xhr object
[04:10:48] <TheWild> ah, I thought there will be more jQuerish way, but that's fine. Thanks Cork.
[04:11:19] <Cork> TheWild: jquery won't parse the body on errors, cause too many servers break the content-type value
[04:11:39] <Cork> (it is very common for them to send html but have the content-type application/json
[08:52:20] <pSouper> hey all o/
[08:52:43] <pSouper> has anyone any experience using Laravel/Cashire
[08:53:30] <pSouper> the docs say it attaches itself to the Users table. what i'd lie ot know it could i attach it to a different table?
[08:54:06] <pSouper> my app has a different subscriber tree. company > user > role
[08:54:42] <pSouper> and i only want to bill companies (or if i must, user->withRole(x)
[08:55:20] <pSouper> would either sound possible to your mind? out of the box (+config tweak) or would you think I'd need to refactor something larger
[08:56:59] <pSouper> i think i have an answer here: https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/using-cashier-with-a-different-table-other-than-users-l54
[08:57:10] <pSouper> use Ballable trait on another model
[08:57:12] <Woet> pSouper: doesn't sound like a jQuery question.
[08:57:25] <pSouper> ooh, thanks. i'm in the wrong room
[08:57:41] <pSouper> thanks @Woet ;)
[09:14:53] <emsjessec> is it ok to put the argument to Regex replace within double quotes?
[09:15:02] <emsjessec> RegExp("^" + p.call(s).replace(n, "\\$&").replace("/hasOwnProperty|(function).*?(?=\\\()| for .+?(?=\\\])/g", "$1.*?") + "$");
[09:18:42] <Woet> emsjessec: does it work?
[09:25:50] <emsjessec> Woet: i don't think so
[09:26:18] <emsjessec> the CDN plugin in WordPress is picking up /hasOwnProperty as a relative URL and prepending the CDN host
[09:26:21] <Woet> emsjessec: theres your answer
[09:27:11] <emsjessec> do you know of a way to rewrite: /hasOwnProperty|(function).*?(?=\\\()| for .+?(?=\\\])/g
[09:28:13] <emsjessec> i'm trying to fool the CDN plugin into not processing /hasOwnProperty as a relative URL
[09:29:57] <AndresInSpace> how can i bind an elm to a function that I am returning from a Self invoked function,(basically replacing the function within itself..)
[09:30:52] <AndresInSpace> var test = (function(){ test = function(e){ console.log(e) }; test.bind(document.getElementById('main')) });
[09:31:04] <AndresInSpace> oh sorry not jquery but still js...
[09:47:39] <Cork> AndresInSpace: that should force the this variable
[09:48:15] <Cork> you're not executing the scope though
[09:48:21] <Cork> and not returning the new value
[09:53:34] <AndresInSpace> got it, thanks cork
[09:53:46] <AndresInSpace> var test = (function(){ test = function(e){ console.log(this) }; return test.bind(document.getElementById('main')) })();
[09:54:22] <Cork> AndresInSpace: or you could just do (function(){ window.test = function(e){ console.log(this) }; window.test.bind(document.getElementById('main')) })();
[09:54:25] <Cork> if it is a global variable
[09:54:35] <AndresInSpace> no im trying to not expose it
[09:54:50] <AndresInSpace> well wait, that part yes
[09:54:52] <AndresInSpace> ill do that
[09:54:55] <AndresInSpace> thanks
[09:55:23] <AndresInSpace> that was a simple example, im doing more in the IIFE before i return the overwritten method
[10:02:56] <AndresInSpace> https://hastebin.com/umabagecic.js cork
[10:03:24] <AndresInSpace> somehow this is window
[10:08:08] <Cork> interesting...
[10:09:48] <Cork> not sure what is happening there to be honest...
[10:11:23] <AndresInSpace> i just assigned the IIFE to a var as I was doing, and it works
[10:11:34] <AndresInSpace> not sure either why with it self contained it doesn't bind it
[10:11:55] <AndresInSpace> thanks tho
[10:11:56] <Cork> might be that you can't assign bind functions to the browser exposed window object?
[10:12:09] <Cork> just guessing though
[10:12:54] <AndresInSpace> eh
[10:13:07] <AndresInSpace> im doing return window.toggleBackToTop.bind(elm); and it works
[11:07:05] <keenor> hey folks. I have a div overlay, and I want jQuery to wait 5 seconds and then fade that div out so that I can access the main container.
[11:07:28] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[11:07:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:08:56] <mmmveggies> every time you pop a modal on a timer, an angel cries
[11:09:05] <robertmaxrees> ^ tru tru
[11:09:10] <keenor> well I am asking for what would be the best way. I was thinking opacity to 0 with css transition of 1 second, but that still is there right
[11:09:35] <keenor> look guys, we know whats good and whats not, but when people want to pay my rent for fancy buttons i do it.
[11:09:45] <robertmaxrees> woah alright heh
[11:09:47] <keenor> call me a hoe i dont care
[11:09:56] <robertmaxrees> okay okay.
[11:10:37] <keenor> what function can i use for delaying an action such as .css
[11:10:38] <robertmaxrees> you could learn about jquery's effects queues and use $.fn.delay, or just use window.setTimeout
[11:10:43] <keenor> i have not done any delay
[11:10:57] <keenor> im doing this on document load
[11:11:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, look at my suggestion above :)
[11:11:33] <keenor> ok
[11:11:34] <keenor> googling
[14:29:06] <znf> Any suggestion for a modern jquery plugin for form validation?
[14:31:27] <znf> I know there's a lot of them around, which makes it harder to find a decent one without trying them all one by one
[17:02:50] <Valk> Hello

[17:04:33] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question
[17:04:38] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[17:04:56] <Valk> I am using jquery UI draggable and resizable
[17:05:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:05:21] <Valk> And i have like 2 divs where one is acting like a camera, and second one is like a canvas
[17:05:33] <robertmaxrees> okay so -
[17:05:36] <Valk> draggable is working fine
[17:05:41] <robertmaxrees> first off: https://jsfiddle.net/ mind putting your code in a jsfiddle?
[17:05:47] <Valk> oh i can
[17:17:26] <robertmaxrees> Valk any luck??
[17:18:02] <Valk> yeah
[17:19:07] <robertmaxrees> lol 'kay.

[17:19:11] <Valk> here
[17:19:16] <Valk> its little bit same
[17:19:38] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's the issue you're having?
[17:19:39] <Valk> but only difference is that even if i have handles, they wont do resize. Its just stuck
[17:20:05] <Valk> and i have see the cursor that changed to disabled
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is you're trying to make something both resizable AND draggable?
[17:21:07] <Valk> not both only
[17:21:08] <Valk> editor
[17:21:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:21:21] <Valk> ah
[17:21:26] <Valk> yeah i thought that you mean wrapper
[17:21:30] <Valk> :D
[17:21:40] <Valk> Yeah, the both draggable and resizable
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4948582/jquery-draggable-and-resizable
[17:22:05] <robertmaxrees> you may need to work it a little differently.
[17:22:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/phpdeveloperrahul/zN62s/#save for another example.
[17:25:49] <Valk> yeah i seen that
[17:25:57] <Valk> but that work if you have containment
[17:26:03] <Valk> what if i want have infinite space ?
[17:26:12] <Valk> like no contaiment ?
[17:27:06] <robertmaxrees> then don't use the containment? :)
[17:27:18] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[17:47:55] <Valk> Okay is there someone else ?
[18:07:32] <Valk> oh you are back robert
[18:07:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:07:48] <Valk> okay i will just reply
[18:07:53] <Valk> i have no contaiment there
[18:08:01] <Valk> the problem is that the handle wont move
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> show me your latest fiddle?
[18:08:26] <Valk> http://jsfiddle.net/d1tgh940/1/
[18:08:46] <Valk> here is working.. but in my project its not
[18:09:04] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like... http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ogLa6zv3/
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> so what makes your project different?
[18:09:35] <Valk> uh its big application
[18:09:40] <Valk> with many libs
[18:09:47] <robertmaxrees> so let me put it this way:
[18:09:52] <robertmaxrees> how can i help? :)
[18:10:02] <Valk> if you know about what can cause that handle is stuck..
[18:10:09] <Valk> like it wont allow you to resize
[18:10:15] <robertmaxrees> any js errors?
[18:10:23] <Valk> nope
[18:11:16] <robertmaxrees> but you said your last fiddle works fine?
[18:11:24] <Valk> yeah that even more..
[18:11:28] <Valk> weird
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using on your site?
[18:12:13] <Valk> give a sec
[18:12:37] <Valk> y v3.3.1
[18:12:41] <Valk> 3.3.1
[18:12:45] <robertmaxrees> that's going to part of why.
[18:12:51] <robertmaxrees> v 3 doesn't play nice with jquery ui.
[18:12:55] <Valk> oh
[18:12:59] <Valk> okay
[18:13:12] <Valk> so i should use other version ?
[18:13:43] <robertmaxrees> i mean, are you doing a lot with jquery ui?  or are you just starting your project?
[18:13:53] <Valk> A lot
[18:14:02] <robertmaxrees> :/
[18:14:04] <Valk> I am using it to have own editor..
[18:14:26] <Valk> but only thing what i am using is resizable and draggable
[18:14:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:14:43] <robertmaxrees> so you're not doing much with jquery ui?
[18:14:57] <Valk> if thats not a lot then yes :D
[18:15:36] <robertmaxrees> did you just start the project?
[18:15:41] <Valk> oh no
[18:15:44] <Valk> its for company
[18:15:52] <Valk> they have spend on it 2 years almost..
[18:16:12] <Valk> i am just doing the graphic part of it..
[18:16:14] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase - are you just now adding jquery ui or has jquery ui been there for a while?
[18:16:24] <Valk> it was added by me
[18:16:24] <Valk> yeah
[18:16:35] <robertmaxrees> i would reconsider that choice then.
[18:16:43] <robertmaxrees> look for another ui library that'll give you that functionality.
[18:16:48] <Valk> hmmmm
[18:17:01] <Valk> do you have any links ?
[18:17:16] <Valk> and what version is best for jquery UI ?
[18:17:19] <robertmaxrees> google :/
[18:17:23] <Valk> its like 1.6 ?
[18:17:25] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap et al.
[18:17:26] <Valk> its like 1.5 ?
[18:17:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:17:39] <Valk> Jquery version
[18:17:44] <Valk> thats best for UI
[18:18:02] <robertmaxrees> 1.9
[18:18:05] <robertmaxrees> but don't do that.
[18:18:08] <robertmaxrees> use something more recent.
[18:18:13] <robertmaxrees> like bootstrap or whatever.
[18:19:55] <Valk> Okay
[18:22:35] <Valk> okay
[18:22:40] <Valk> i have fixed that
[18:22:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:22:49] <Valk> change version UI from 1.9 to 1.12
[18:22:55] <Valk> that supports ver 3
[18:22:58] <Valk> and its okay
[18:22:59] <Valk> THX
[18:23:00] <robertmaxrees> mao
[18:23:01] <robertmaxrees> *lmao
[18:23:03] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[18:23:04] <Valk> xD
[18:23:14] <Valk> sometimes it makes me give up to
[18:23:17] <Valk> but..
[18:23:23] <Valk> give up to jquery ? No way!
[18:23:31] <robertmaxrees> *jquery ui
[18:23:43] <Valk> yeah
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> it hasn't been updated in 2 years.
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> but (shrug) your headaches later, not mine.
[18:25:24] <Valk> nah its pitty
[18:25:39] <Valk> it was great help for me at beginning
[18:25:47] <robertmaxrees> lol

[18:29:37] <Valk> yeah
[18:29:46] <Valk> i know
[18:31:44] <Valk> thanks a lot bye
[19:56:51] <sine`> hi my loves
[19:57:14] <sine`> im hungry, can someone feed me
[19:57:30] <sine`> jQuery('.pure_loader_container').delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).addClass('ld_hide'); });
[19:58:16] <sine`> why does delay work with queue but not if i just do css or addclass
[21:13:39] <shoky> sine`: because css and addclass do not add to the queue :p  and stuff that are automatically added to the queue are just animations, which are async by nature.  you can queue something for after an animation completes - that doesn’t make sense with css or addclass which happen and complete right away (synchronously)
