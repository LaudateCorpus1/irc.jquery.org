[00:00:26] <bobdobbs> it does!
[00:00:42] <bobdobbs> thanks!
[00:01:01] <bobdobbs> you know what? I've applied that approach once myself. like, years ago.
[00:01:15] <bobdobbs> I remember struggling with the same issue for hours.
[00:04:15] <D-rex> also  you can swap body with whatever the parent element just make sure its laoded into the dom
[00:05:28] * bobdobbs nods. glances over docs for on()
[00:05:40] <bobdobbs> thanks
[00:10:31] <D-rex> yw...delgated events in the docs is where it explains it
[00:11:11] <bobdobbs> I see

[01:00:20] <hghodke_> Hi.. Any jquery validate plugin without form tag.. please help..
[01:00:56] <Uhkis> depending on your needs, it's pretty easy to write yourself
[01:02:05] <hghodke_> I need generic code which can be used in multiple pages
[01:05:46] <Uhkis> can't you add the form tags? you can just prevent the regular submit
[02:05:06] <kulelu88> can someone tell me what the second line in this piece of code does: https://pastee.org/rpc5y ?
[02:06:32] <konrados> kulelu88,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:
[02:07:55] <konrados> so if orderList is NOT false/undefined/0/null then orderList will be === rderList.split(',') otherwise it will be an empty array.
[02:08:31] <kulelu88> konrados: with that being said, can you tell me why/where my loading-items code is wrong here: https://pastee.org/bxm9c
[02:09:04] <kulelu88> so orderList.split(',') is splitting the array?
[02:12:12] <kulelu88> this is my original function konrados : https://pastee.org/hntcz
[02:12:23] <konrados> It split a *string*, so you get an array finally, kulelu88 - why do you think your code is wrong?
[02:12:29] <kulelu88> if you'd like to see my JSFiddle, I can show you that as well
[02:12:54] <kulelu88> konrados: because when I attempt to use the new method, it doesn't render (or renders incorrectly)
[02:13:49] <Cork> kulelu88: localStorage is a key value store that can only store strings
[02:14:15] <Cork> so if you want to store structured data you have to convert it to and from a string
[02:14:27] <Cork> (this is normally done as json though)
[02:14:50] <kulelu88> let me show you my JSFiddle Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/7x9x2cvd/
[02:15:25] <konrados> Cork it seems he does store data as comma separated items, but I did not have a coffee yet.
[02:15:57] <Cork> ya, the storage is most likely done as .join(',')
[02:16:17] <Cork> that wasn't what i meant by the "normally part"
[02:16:34] <Cork> kulelu88: what part is failing for you?
[02:17:46] <kulelu88> Cork: in the code rewrite: https://pastee.org/bxm9c . Using what should be proper jquery syntax (eg. $.each() for looping), my items are not rendering
[02:18:52] <Cork> ugg
[02:18:58] <Cork> no you NEVER append in a loop
[02:20:02] <kulelu88> Cork: forgive me, but I am using code from other references.
[02:20:33] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v76dpae3/
[02:21:06] <Cork> kulelu88: if you do .append in a loop you will force the browser to reflow the page on every append
[02:21:27] <Cork> it is the most expensive action the browser has (that doesn't involve io)
[02:21:41] <Cork> so you want to build all new content and insert it in one go
[02:22:04] <Cork> in this case you can replace empty + append with .html as that will replace everything
[02:22:51] <Cork> secondly you should build a dom element and set text to it, else you get into the risk of xss
[02:23:13] <Cork> (the reason for the second change)
[02:23:21] <Cork> and it also makes the code more readable
[02:24:05] <Cork> that said... the code i gave you is wrong...
[02:24:16] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v76dpae3/1/
[02:24:30] <Cork> (i hate that $.each and $.map has different attribute order...)
[02:25:22] <Cork> btw you can rewrite orderList = orderList ? orderList.split(',') : [];
[02:25:31] <Cork> as orderList = orderList.split(',') || [];
[02:26:21] <Cork> hmm actually you don't need to hmm...
[02:26:27] <kulelu88> it seems that when adding new items, they are not appended correctly as well
[02:27:07] <Cork> kulelu88: this code only handles restoring from localstorage
[02:27:44] <Cork> btw the || tip up there was wrong, ignore that
[02:28:04] <Cork> forgot that getItem returns null if the key doesn't exist
[02:29:00] <Cork> (orderList || '').split(',') is an option buy eh...
[02:29:05] <Cork> *but
[02:31:09] <kulelu88> Cork: it also seems that when using the code you provided, it shows the items as "todo-35" instead of the actual item
[02:31:38] <kulelu88> I must be doing something wrong in between adding and loading
[02:31:39] <Cork> kulelu88: did you use the /1 version?
[02:31:47] <kulelu88> Cork: the second version
[02:31:58] <Cork> hmm
[02:32:11] <Cork> they should be doing the exact same thing
[02:32:52] <kulelu88> then when I add a new item, it will add it to the bottom (not as a new <li>), and when I hit refresh, it show show 2 blank <li> and then "todo-37"
[02:33:14] <Cork> O_o
[02:33:37] <Cork> kulelu88: could you make a jsfiddle with the effect you see?
[02:34:48] <kulelu88> I don't want to give you grief, but is there a reason why this JSFiddle doesn't run: https://jsfiddle.net/7x9x2cvd/ ? It is exactly all the code I have
[02:35:15] <kulelu88> there is no extra code. I included every CSS, every JS dependency
[02:43:40] <kulelu88> Please don't write any code for me Cork (I assume you aren't), just looking for some guidance as to where I am screwing up
[02:44:28] <Cork> heh no i have work enough to write my own :)
[02:44:43] <kulelu88> :P
[02:45:04] <kulelu88> everyone kept telling me - create a JSFiddle - yet when I did, it didnt work :D
[02:45:45] <Cork> hmm it appears to be depending on ajax
[02:46:21] <Cork> i need to see what the array you get contains so i can check why the .map fails
[02:46:27] <Cork> anyway gtg
[02:46:39] <kulelu88> take care Cork
[03:20:41] <Cork> there
[03:21:12] <Cork> kulelu88: could you run a console.log(JSON.stringify(orderList)) before the line where it builds the list?
[03:21:28] <Cork> that output should give me everything i need to see why the code fails
[03:21:28] <kulelu88> Cork: I got a working example for you in JSFiddle now :D
[03:21:33] <Cork> ah
[03:21:59] <kulelu88> https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/
[03:22:02] <kulelu88> Cork: ^
[03:23:32] <kulelu88> Cork: please try this one instead: https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/1/
[03:23:40] <kulelu88> that previous 1 uses a broken pubsub.js
[03:25:38] <Cork> $.subscribe and $.publish is still undefined
[03:27:14] <Cork> hmm looks like old cache
[03:27:14] <kulelu88> Cork: is that Chrome?
[03:27:44] <Cork> no the old pubsub.js was in my browser cache
[03:28:34] <Cork> ok, and the code you want to replace is line 19-26?
[03:29:12] <kulelu88> Cork: well that is my code as is. my goal is to render each item with something akin to this: http://www.w3schools.com/jquerymobile/tryit.asp?filename=tryjqmob_lists_views
[03:29:35] <kulelu88> so it *works*, but the <li>s are not rendering like they should
[03:29:41] <Cork> no need for the <a href="#">
[03:29:52] <Cork> why include broken links when you don't plan to use them
[03:30:47] <kulelu88> Cork: this part here: <a href='#'>X</a></li>" ? that is for deleting the item
[03:31:53] <Cork> kulelu88: use <button>x</button> for actions
[03:32:06] <Cork> you can style buttons to look like links if you want that design
[03:32:10] <Cork> but don't abuse <a>
[03:34:03] <kulelu88> that is probably where I got confused Cork , cause this example shows them using <a> for that effect: http://www.w3schools.com/jquerymobile/tryit.asp?filename=tryjqmob_lists_views
[03:44:52] <Cork> kulelu88: had to fiddle a while to fix the github references but here is how i would do it https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/5/
[03:45:39] <Cork> kulelu88: note that you need to use //rawgit.com/ if you want to use it as a resource
[03:45:44] <Cork> else the mime type will be wrong
[03:46:01] <Cork> kulelu88: also note that i added a <script> tag at the top of the html section
[03:48:29] <Cork> kulelu88: and for the styling https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/6/
[03:49:40] <kulelu88> Cork: how do you render each of them into their own <li>s so that it ends up looking like this: http://www.w3schools.com/jquerymobile/tryit.asp?filename=tryjqmob_lists_split
[03:50:01] <Cork> kulelu88: don't use w3schools; ever
[03:50:04] <kulelu88> that was my main problem, to get the button and content split into boxes
[03:50:18] <Cork> it is a horrible site for reference
[03:50:19] <kulelu88> oh, sorry, I didn't know I shouldn't use it
[03:50:35] <Cork> http://www.w3fools.com/
[03:50:48] <kulelu88> I see that they 'abuse' <a> like you mentioned
[03:51:25] <Cork> kulelu88: in the map i generate a new set of dom elements
[03:51:34] <Cork> from the template in the <script>
[03:51:46] <Cork> then i set the text and push the result into an array
[03:52:02] <Cork> then i append all of it into the item List
[03:52:19] <Cork> (though as this happens on load it should prob use .html)
[03:52:38] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/7/
[03:53:09] <Cork> kulelu88: if you want to change what gets rendered into the row you modify line 2 in the html section
[03:54:26] <kulelu88> Cork: so I do the formatting adjustments in the script tag on line 2 right?
[03:54:33] <Cork> yes
[03:54:47] <Cork> note that if you remove the span you would have to modify the finder in the loop
[03:55:19] <Cork> you should keep a dedicated element for the content of the task text (for ease of modifying it)
[03:59:35] <kulelu88> Cork: the static solution displays each 1 as I I am trying to do, but making it static also eliminates the possibility of editing it. So I am guessing the issue here is to find the correct <li> styling for it
[03:59:40] <kulelu88> https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/8/
[04:00:17] <Cork> you prob need class='editable'
[04:01:21] <Cork> kulelu88: https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/9/
[04:01:34] <Cork> kulelu88: also note this version isn't more static then the old solution
[04:01:40] <Cork> just better separated
[04:02:28] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/10/ <-- moved the x into the li again
[04:05:01] <kulelu88> Cork: seems static won't work, as adding is broken now
[04:05:33] <Cork> i haven't modified adding
[04:05:41] <Cork> you would have to change it to use the template
[04:06:07] <kulelu88> oh interesting, let me try doing that
[04:06:41] <Cork> the change i did was to get you started :)
[04:06:49] <kulelu88> Cork: so all my adding/remove code will now look similar to the load code?
[04:07:04] <Cork> you don't need the map as you only do one
[04:07:11] <Cork> but for the rest, yes
[04:07:33] <Cork> so take the code from inside the map loop and run that separately
[04:07:40] <Cork> then append the row you generate
[04:09:06] <kulelu88> I really need to brush up on the quirks on jquery after this :P thank you so much for the hand-holding Cork
[04:09:16] <Cork> np
[04:09:53] <Cork> also much of what i did here isn't explicit to jquery
[04:10:04] <Cork> it is just good javascript practises
[04:10:13] <kulelu88> Cork: would using angular/react have been easier?
[04:10:23] <Cork> not really
[04:10:30] <Cork> just different :)
[04:11:10] <kulelu88> I wanted minimal dependencies
[04:23:34] <kulelu88> I managed to style it a bit better now Cork : https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/11/
[04:24:45] <Cork> kulelu88: nice, https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/12/
[04:25:35] <kulelu88> now I just need to push the content to the left, button to the right haha
[04:26:33] <kulelu88> I am trying to wrap my head around how to add an item now, but I am not sure. you said take the inner workings of .map, so I need to replace ALL the code?
[04:41:18] <Cork> kulelu88: https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/13/
[04:49:32] <Cork> kulelu88: https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/14/
[04:59:12] <Cork> kulelu88: something like https://jsfiddle.net/7camhnjt/15/ ?
[04:59:59] <kulelu88> yep, that's perfect Cork ! thank you so much
[05:00:05] <Cork> np
[05:30:17] <WebDevB> Hey guys, anyone around?
[05:44:20] <konrados> yeap
[05:50:05] <spoonUltra> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VaNKBP?editors=1111 it no work
[05:53:55] <FilipNortic> how is it you do ajax on page unload the top sugestion on google was async:false is that still the way to go? feels backwards...
[05:54:51] <Cork> FilipNortic: the recommended solution is to not do it at all
[05:54:59] <Cork> FilipNortic: what are you trying to do?
[05:55:16] <Cork> (there is almost always other ways to accomplish the same thing)
[05:55:36] <FilipNortic> free supply when user refreshes
[05:55:56] <Cork> spoonUltra: $(".names").offset() is a function not a property
[05:56:26] <Cork> free supply?
[05:56:32] <Cork> you mean an ad or...?
[05:59:31] <FilipNortic> no the way webshops do it it resev themselves form supply misscounts so if the don't have an item in stock they backorder it but here the supply must always be the true value and when a user refreshes or hit back he loses his supply count
[05:59:35] <MacroMan> If I append a new element to the DOM, is there a delay in the browser creating that element? So much that a selector after the insertion would select nothing in very slow browsers?
[06:00:03] <Cork> hmm ok
[06:00:37] <Cork> well one way to do it would be to use websocket, and when the connection gets lost you remove the references
[06:01:09] <Cork> FilipNortic: alternatively you could have a timer for the reservation and clear it after a "while"
[06:01:43] <Cork> FilipNortic: the unload events are a common vektor for user attacks so browsers are talking about disabling the event
[06:01:56] <Cork> so depending on the different unload events is not future safe
[06:02:14] <Cork> MacroMan: no
[06:02:32] <Cork> MacroMan: javascript won't execute until the browser has added the element
[06:02:33] <Duikb00t> wow what am I missing
[06:02:43] <FilipNortic> hmm ok yeah we have the after a while solution now but in some cases it's not good enough
[06:02:51] <MacroMan> Cork, Damn. A set back in debugging my code then.
[06:02:57] <MacroMan> Cork, Thanks.
[06:03:01] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/kzbuhh/
[06:03:17] <Cork> FilipNortic: the websocket solution is a possibility though
[06:03:26] <Duikb00t> When I scale to mobile from desktop it works, when I close the mobile menu with the trigger and I scale again to the desktop my menu is gone 'display none' for some reason
[06:03:33] <FilipNortic> yeah i'll look in to it
[06:03:33] <Cork> you can get VERY good reference to what the visitors do with it
[06:03:45] <Duikb00t> I tried adding a resize handler if window width is large then 750 ... then show menu but still no success ><
[06:04:01] <Cork> we use it here and heck could use it for visitor pattern analyzis :)
[06:04:22] <MacroMan> +1 for websockets. I use them all the time for user tracking and session recording
[06:05:29] <Cork> Duikb00t: a bit too little context
[06:05:43] <Cork> what resize handle and what isn't working?
[06:05:54] <Duikb00t> I could send you a link in private if that's ok for you?
[06:06:04] <Duikb00t> Its something really stupid im missing
[06:06:35] <Cork> i suspect it might be that you're hiding it with media queries and when you show it the media query still win
[06:06:56] <Cork> and no i can't take time off to look through a page (someone else might)
[06:14:26] <konrados> klender: https://jsfiddle.net/6rv9bzcq/12/
[06:22:02] <konrados> klender, did you notice my answer?
[06:26:11] <Duikb00t> Some fullpage.js users?
[06:28:13] <nxplus> Duikb00t : what's the issue?
[06:29:24] <Duikb00t> Only 3 'sections' are scrollable :p
[06:29:58] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/wnssqn/
[06:30:29] <Duikb00t> lol seems to be fixed
[06:31:05] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to adust the heights? It seems that the 'full page' scrolling thing is not doing it for 100% the previous slide is being shown as well.
[06:40:25] <nxplus> would it be possible to post a jsfiddle?
[07:02:58] <Duikb00t> very hard :s I can send a demo in a private link?
[07:03:30] <Duikb00t> nxplus:  ;)
[07:05:05] <nxplus> sure, as long as I can see the height issue myself
[07:56:10] <Len> hello
[07:58:03] <Len> Guys, hown can I keep <div> hidden/shown by some button after refreshing page? It's simple form with "Show hidden fields", after that I would like to keep my div open/hidden after page refresh
[07:58:34] <Len> Right now I'm using simple <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#additional_search">Show all fields</button>
[07:59:29] <nxplus> is using cookies or localstorage an option?
[08:00:06] <Len> nxplus: hmm good idea, but I was rather thinking about passing some parm in URI
[08:00:27] <Len> like show_hidden=1/0
[08:01:12] <Cork> Len: ya, you can use navigator.history.pushState
[08:01:44] <Cork> and i would prob go that way, makes it easy for them to share the link and still show what they're talking about
[08:02:17] <Len> mhm, gotta find some example
[08:02:26] <Cork> (alternatively you can use replaceState if you don't want to add an extra entry in the history)
[08:02:49] <Cork> Len: it is quite simple navigator.history.replaceState("", {}, url)
[08:03:11] <nxplus> for a large scale app I wouldn't depend on url params for such a thing. but it may be enough in your case
[08:03:35] <Cork> nxplus: the scale of the app doesn't matter actually
[08:03:36] <Len> It's admin side, shouldn't be a problem
[08:03:54] <Cork> it is good cause it makes the url what it is meant to be (the reprecentation of what you see)
[08:04:48] <nxplus> Cork: perhaps, but typically dashboards/admins (with logins) usually have such values stored somewhere
[08:05:12] <Cork> nxplus: stored server side you mean?
[08:05:18] <Len> Hmm, so lets say I'm creating hidden form named `show_hidden` with default value set to 0. I'm using that thing to manipulate param in URL to change value to 1. Thats right?
[08:05:27] <Len> (not really js guy)
[08:05:28] <Cork> cause if you store it in the browser the data gets lost if they go to another browser
[08:05:37] <Len> yeah that make sense
[08:05:54] <Cork> Len: make the hiding dependent on the get parameter
[08:06:03] <Cork> so if they reload the url the form is still visible
[08:06:18] <Cork> then you show it with js, and modify the url (no reload needed)
[08:06:27] <Len> mhm, gotta
[08:06:30] <nxplus> Cork: if using logins with user configurations, then naturally stored on the server yes,
[08:06:59] <Len> it's just simple hidden part of form
[08:07:09] <Cork> nxplus: can't say i've seen any cms system or the likes that has a table with what widgets they have visible/hidden
[08:07:13] <Len> no server side state needed imo
[08:07:21] <Cork> ya
[08:07:35] <Len> thanks for pointing me to good path Cork :)
[08:07:49] <Cork> np, i use it my self quite a bit so :)
[08:08:22] <nxplus> well it's the only way to persist the configuration to other machines so..
[08:09:05] <Cork> Len: btw for the params window.location.href.replace(/\?.*/,'') + $.param({ form: 'hidden' })
[08:09:48] <Cork> nxplus: storing it server side has the problem that it makes it impossible to have different states in different tabs
[08:10:04] <Cork> and other machines is mostly for if they share a link
[08:33:38] <nxplus> Cork: params might be the best with this case, I was just sharing ideas of persisting configuration in general (many systems depend on storing with tables)
[08:33:57] <nxplus> so it might have been a bit out of scope
[08:38:49] <Cork> nxplus: it depends a lot on what the setting is
[08:39:10] <Cork> but ya, for some settings sure, i do that too
[08:39:22] <Cork> the state of widgets in the page though, no
[08:39:33] <Cork> (or values in searches)
[08:40:00] <nxplus> you are most certainly correct with that yes
[08:45:31] <Slereah> I'm having some trouble making some jquery script work
[08:45:37] <Slereah> Currently the script is just
[08:46:01] <Slereah> jQuery( document ).on( 'click', '.upload_url_list_button', function() {console.log("test");})
[08:46:26] <Slereah> With the form <form method="post">	<input id="upload_url_list" name="upload_url_list" class="upload_url_list_button button" type="button" value="Upload Image" name="submit"></form>
[08:46:35] <Slereah> But nothing doing, it just won't execute it
[08:47:03] <Slereah> I also tried with jQuery(function(jQuery) { jQuery('.upload_url_list_button').click(function() { ..., but no different result
[08:47:12] <nxplus> Slereah : I believe you shouldn't post code here directly..
[08:47:18] <Slereah> The script is loaded, but it doesn't work
[08:47:39] <Slereah> I usually use pastebin, but is it important if it's ust one line?
[08:48:29] <Slereah> anyway, not sure why it just won't execute it
[08:48:37] <Slereah> The form is in an iframe, could that be important?
[08:48:55] <YamakasY> guys will .attr() be supported in 1.9+ ?
[08:49:02] <YamakasY> instead of prop() ?
[08:51:12] <shoky> uhm they are both supported. and they do different things
[08:51:29] <YamakasY> oh ok so than some people use it wrong it seems
[08:51:30] <YamakasY> :)
[08:51:38] <shoky> that's always a given
[08:55:23] <YamakasY> shoky: given fact ?
[08:55:25] <nxplus> Slereah : im not following, I do get "test" in the console.. see https://jsfiddle.net/pkjLe8za/
[08:57:19] <Slereah> I do not
[08:57:27] <nxplus> weird
[08:57:38] <Slereah> There's a whole lot of wordpress around it, not sure what part of it poses problem
[08:58:04] <Slereah> I have other forms that work out okay within it, though
[08:58:19] <Slereah> The form is within an iframe, so I'm thinking that might be the problem, but i don't have a clue
[08:58:47] <jose3_> im using the bootstrap modals, what kind of event would i need to  run some code if a user closes a modal?
[08:59:24] <nxplus> Slereah: maybe replace click with something like: $(document).on("click","#elem",function() {...
[09:01:25] <Slereah> Let's try
[09:01:29] <nxplus> im sorry, meant try $('.upload_url_list_button').click(function() {
[09:01:33] <nxplus> im blind
[09:01:42] <Slereah> Oh, I already tried that
[09:02:05] <nxplus> and place it inside windows.ready?
[09:06:13] <Slereah> windows.ready?
[09:07:09] <nxplus> yes just wrap with $( document ).ready(function() {}
[09:07:36] * taplar mmmmm, cupcakes
[09:07:49] <taplar> or shorthand $(function(){});
[09:07:51] <Slereah> I'll give it a shot
[09:08:29] <Slereah> http://pastebin.com/HcDPN0Ex
[09:08:31] <Slereah> thusly?
[09:10:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rbxt2moe/
[09:10:22] <Slereah> Oh, missing a );
[09:10:42] <Slereah> Still not working with it, though
[09:11:10] <taplar> what's the problem?
[09:11:37] <Slereah> Well the console just doesn't display anything upon clicking the button
[09:11:54] <taplar> does the  button exist at the time of binding?
[09:12:28] <taplar> and have you confirmed that by console logging the selector?
[09:13:00] <Slereah> No, the script is binded when the wordpress starts up
[09:13:18] <Slereah> The button appears only when opening an iframe
[09:13:34] <taplar> console.log($('.upload_url_list_button').length); at the start of that closure
[09:13:36] <taplar> what do you see?
[09:14:09] <taplar> in relation to the iframe, where is this code, and where is the button?
[09:14:52] <Slereah> http://i.imgur.com/d9SXVtr.png
[09:14:55] <Slereah> ^the thing, btw
[09:15:12] <taplar> so the button is in the iframe
[09:15:19] <taplar> where is the code?
[09:15:26] <taplar> on the parent doc?
[09:15:39] <taplar> because selectors do not work across doms
[09:15:45] <Slereah> That logging just gives 0
[09:15:59] <taplar> you need to put your logic on that page in the iframe
[09:16:05] <taplar> would be the easiest approach
[09:16:30] <Slereah> Any tutorial to be doing that in mind?
[09:16:36] <Slereah> Not that great at Jquery I'm afraid
[09:16:44] <taplar> it's just another page in the iframe.  treat it as a normal page
[09:17:10] <Slereah> I tried to bind the script in the iframe itself, but it didn't work unfortunately
[09:17:23] <taplar> how so?
[09:17:26] <Slereah> not sure it's too easy to do in wordpress
[09:19:04] <taplar> what did you do when you tried to bind in the iframe?
[09:19:28] <Slereah> wp_enqueue_script('upload_file_list', get_template_directory_uri().'/js/upload_file_list.js', array('jquery'), '1.0', true );
[09:19:43] <Slereah> When loading the page within the iframe
[09:19:47] <Slereah> Since that is the wordpress way
[09:20:18] <taplar> ok, so are you saying that wordpress is generating the contents of that iframe and you don't have a way of putting a script on that included source page?
[09:20:43] <Slereah> Well the iframe is the one of the media manager window
[09:20:54] <Slereah> I can add things to it but I don't have quite direct control of it
[09:22:02] <taplar> ok, so we'll go with the second approach
[09:22:03] <taplar> i'm assuming these are all on the same domain, yes?
[09:22:08] <Slereah> yes
[09:22:13] <Slereah> Currently everything on localhost
[09:22:49] <taplar> ok, so try this.  after the iframe has loaded try running this
[09:23:00] <taplar> $(selectorForTheIframe).contents()
[09:23:01] <maasha> I am working on a jquery-ui dialog, but the dialog messages gets attached to the body everytime I close it: https://gist.github.com/maasha/a7609fd91f34cc10c057427eba46efd7
[09:23:22] <Kartagis> if I've got an unknown number of images, I suspect I have to do an $.each(). after doing this, how can I place them onto specific divs?
[09:23:37] <ptrin> Hey all, I'm looking for information on when a specific feature in jQuery was updated.  I'm talking about the ability to modify the type attribute of an input field with the attr() method. Does anyone have any idea of what version that changed in?
[09:23:52] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/t1ehvx3q/
[09:24:26] <Slereah> Errr how can I run this?
[09:24:41] <Slereah> Can I use a script tag to add it?
[09:24:47] <taplar> for now try just sticking it in the console
[09:24:52] <Slereah> Oh right
[09:24:52] <taplar> when the iframe is visible
[09:24:53] <Slereah> Let's see
[09:25:05] <Slereah> ReferenceError: selectorForTheIframe is not defined
[09:25:15] <taplar> right, you have to change that
[09:25:20] <taplar> that was pseudocode, :P
[09:26:01] <taplar> maasha: when does that method get called?
[09:26:02] <Slereah> Quite sad that I have to do this for a living :p
[09:26:05] <Slereah> Not knowing about it
[09:26:18] <Slereah> What do I put in its place?
[09:26:29] <taplar> whatever selector will get the iframe
[09:26:33] <taplar> as the name implies
[09:27:14] <Slereah> The iframe doesn't seem to have a name associated to it?
[09:27:16] <Slereah> http://i.imgur.com/d9SXVtr.png
[09:27:20] <Slereah> If that is relevant
[09:27:27] <taplar> do you have more than one iframe on the page?
[09:27:44] <maasha> taplar: it is called from a contextmenu: https://gist.github.com/maasha/3730979cb6e5cbf2b86f7bb72b859ca1
[09:28:02] <Slereah> Possibly
[09:28:13] <taplar> maasha: well your appending to the body every time that method is called
[09:28:17] <Slereah> a bit hard to wade through all the wordpress code but there seems to be some
[09:28:30] <taplar> Slereah: console.log($('form').length);
[09:28:47] <taplar> crap
[09:28:47] <maasha> taplar: yes, that is not really what I wanted
[09:28:52] <taplar> Slereah: console.log($('iframe').length);
[09:29:04] <Slereah> 2, apparently
[09:29:11] <taplar> ok, lets see
[09:29:25] <taplar> Slereah: console.log($('.media-iframe iframe').length);
[09:29:35] <Slereah> just the one
[09:29:39] <taplar> there ya go
[09:30:19] <hellyeah> hey sup
[09:30:50] <Slereah> So what do I use to get the content()?
[09:30:50] <taplar> maasha: so either you'll need to change it to do it only once, or potentially check to see if what you appended already exists, and if so either don't append, or replace with the new version
[09:30:53] <hellyeah> i finished my work but there is one tiny problem xD
[09:31:10] <taplar> Slereah: stick $('.media-iframe iframe').content() in your console
[09:31:33] <Slereah> I tried but I just get TypeError: $(...).content is not a function
[09:31:38] <taplar> oh sorry
[09:31:46] <taplar> replace $ with jQuery
[09:31:48] <taplar> since your in WP
[09:32:06] <taplar> and it's plural, contents()
[09:32:06] <Slereah> ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined
[09:32:08] <Slereah> Dang it
[09:32:14] <hellyeah> WP?
[09:32:17] <maasha> taplar: right
[09:32:19] <taplar> wordpress
[09:32:23] <hellyeah> ah
[09:32:25] <Slereah> maybe I should ask the wordpress stackexchange
[09:32:34] <taplar> not JQuery
[09:32:35] <Slereah> They might have a specific solution
[09:32:35] <hellyeah> Slereah:
[09:32:36] <taplar> jQuery
[09:32:38] <taplar> lowercase j
[09:32:41] <hellyeah> i am sure there is a channel
[09:32:44] <hellyeah> for wordpress
[09:32:45] <Slereah> there is, yes
[09:32:49] <Slereah> it's a bit moribund, though
[09:32:58] <hellyeah> JQuery
[09:33:01] <taplar> small j
[09:33:05] <Slereah> Object[Document media-upload.php?chromeless=1&post_id=112&tab=tab_slug]
[09:33:06] <Slereah> ah yes
[09:33:08] <hellyeah> it is jQuery
[09:33:15] <taplar> eh!
[09:33:29] <Slereah> anything in particular in that object?
[09:33:32] <taplar> i think we maybe good
[09:33:37] <taplar> one sec
[09:33:38] * hellyeah jQuery is more charismatic rather then JQuery xD
[09:34:01] <taplar> $('.media-iframe iframe').contents().find('body')
[09:34:18] <Slereah> Object[body]
[09:34:21] <Slereah> it is there, yes
[09:34:23] <taplar> :)
[09:34:29] <taplar> so you have access to that other dom
[09:34:37] <taplar> so you can do bindings and stuff
[09:34:41] <Slereah> What is dom btw
[09:34:43] * hellyeah dont know anything about iframe
[09:34:47] <taplar> Document Object Model
[09:35:00] <taplar> it's what HTML is parsed into and the browser uses to actually draw your page
[09:35:13] <hellyeah> Slereah:  it is tree structure for representing HTML
[09:35:24] <Cork> taplar: not draw, but parse
[09:35:36] <Slereah> So what can I do to run that script then?
[09:35:39] <Cork> they use a separate data structure for what they actually draw
[09:35:48] <taplar> interesting
[09:36:05] <hellyeah> seperate data structure you mean "tree" Cork ?
[09:36:14] <taplar> Slereah: so you'll want to do something with that after the iframe shows
[09:36:32] <Cork> hellyeah: don't remember the name, and it differs from engine to engine
[09:36:36] <taplar> in which case with access to that iframe dom, your free to do whatever bindings/modifications you want, as if you were on that page
[09:36:47] <hellyeah> Cork:  i see
[09:36:48] <Cork> taplar, hellyeah: the dom is there to let javascript navigate the elements
[09:37:24] <Slereah> I tried to bind the script when the iframe loads but doesn't seem to?
[09:37:38] <taplar> what did you try?
[09:37:39] <hellyeah> manipulate DOM
[09:37:41] <Slereah> If I do that instead of at the beginning, the script doesn't appear in the list of scripts
[09:37:41] <Cork> Slereah: what is the problem (wasn't here at the start of the question)
[09:37:42] <maasha> taplar: ok, so now only adding the dialog once, and set it to .hide() - that works
[09:38:11] <taplar> he's trying to bind one a button inside an iframe loaded by wp
[09:38:14] <taplar> one = on
[09:38:33] <Cork> and the iframe is loaded from the same domain?
[09:38:36] <taplar> Slereah: you'd have to do it after the iframe loads, not at the load of the original page
[09:38:38] <taplar> yep
[09:38:53] <Slereah> Well, here's the function that is executed during the loading
[09:38:55] <Slereah> http://pastebin.com/MXYYqdTi
[09:39:08] <Cork> ya, you have to bind an onload event on the iframe and from there navigate into the iframe and bind the event handler
[09:39:59] <taplar> no clue about wp stuff, :(
[09:40:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i show you my last effort?
[09:40:50] <Slereah> No clue how to do that
[09:40:57] <taplar> hellyeah: sure
[09:41:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  you can go any month, any year in .from and .to https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/32/
[09:41:34] <Cork> Slereah: as far as i can tell those only adds script files to the iframe html
[09:41:44] <Cork> Slereah: and that should actually work just fine
[09:42:00] <Slereah> The script isn't loaded, though
[09:42:01] <Slereah> Not sure why
[09:42:11] <Cork> Slereah: check where wp puts the script tag
[09:42:14] <Slereah> might be a wordpress problem, because it works fine outside of it
[09:42:37] <Cork> this looks more like a ##php or ##wordpress question by the second
[09:42:38] <Cork> ya
[09:42:58] <Slereah> yeah maybe I should make a question on Wordpress Stack Exchange
[09:43:44] <Slereah> Thanks for the help, anyhow
[09:44:19] <hellyeah> Slereah:
[09:44:27] <taplar> hellyeah: $.trim($(this).text())
[09:44:29] <hellyeah> #wordpres and ##wordpress both exist
[09:44:37] <taplar> $().text().trim()
[09:44:41] <Slereah> That they do, but I asked there already
[09:44:44] <Slereah> Not a lot of activity
[09:44:45] <hellyeah> taplar:  $trim is for removing white space
[09:45:05] <taplar> String.prototype has a trim method
[09:45:06] <hellyeah> taplar:  let me check
[09:45:24] <hellyeah> taplar:  did i use wrongly?
[09:45:52] <taplar> eh, I guess it depends if you need IE <9 support
[09:46:10] <taplar> strange, figured that would be an older method
[09:47:02] <helyeah> taplar:  sorry i disconnected
[09:47:13] <helyeah> taplar:  i dont think i need those support
[09:47:50] <helyeah> taplar:  i guess my progress is all good
[09:48:05] <taplar> but other than that, just glancing at the code i don't see anything big.  just some uncached $(this) here and there.  and you still have $box# variables that are still not very descriptive about what they are
[09:48:28] <helyeah> i will change that
[09:48:50] <helyeah> taplar:  i hope one day i can write bigger things
[09:49:00] <helyeah> something is always better than nothing
[09:49:11] <taplar> 'bigger' ?
[09:49:19] <helyeah> bigger project
[09:49:38] <helyeah> people around me dont know javascript thats really obstacle
[09:50:00] <helyeah> i think to change my job hopefully next job make me get into JS more deeply
[09:50:12] <taplar> ah, well, of course this is just my opinion, that just involves finding your own coding pattern/architecture that makes sense
[09:50:48] <taplar> and you don't have to write it all if you don't want to
[09:51:05] <taplar> lots of frameworks out there that can help standardize your code base in that regard
[09:51:11] <helyeah> i like JavaScript, Jquery
[09:51:15] <taplar> no no
[09:51:17] <taplar> frameworks
[09:51:22] <taplar> angular, react, etc
[09:51:37] <helyeah> i think to learn about angular
[09:51:38] <taplar> or even underscore
[09:51:55] <taplar> though maybe underscore and react are libraries.... *shrug*
[09:51:57] <helyeah> let me check that
[09:52:28] <helyeah> there is lots of thing
[09:53:08] <helyeah> first i need to learn node.JS imho
[09:53:32] <taplar> shouldn't be that hard
[09:53:48] <taplar> provided you might have to beef up your js chops a little more
[09:54:12] <helyeah> beef up?
[09:54:16] <helyeah> what does that mean
[09:54:17] <taplar> improve
[09:54:28] <helyeah> i am taking note about new things
[09:54:33] <taplar> heh
[09:54:36] <helyeah> at the same time i improve my english
[09:54:51] <taplar> it's most likely derived from body building
[09:55:14] <taplar> getting stronger == beefing up == improving
[09:55:17] <helyeah> js chops?
[09:55:27] <taplar> heh, js skills
[09:55:34] <taplar> i dunno where that originates
[09:55:56] <Xatenev> Heya
[09:56:07] <helyeah> thanks taplar
[09:56:09] <Xatenev> Why would this not work? $('.panel-group').fadeOut(400,function(){$('.en').fadeIn();});
[09:56:15] <helyeah> you are real nice person indeed
[09:56:21] <Xatenev> Basically it should fadeIn when the fadeOut is FINISHED
[09:56:22] <helyeah> Xatenev:
[09:56:28] <helyeah> i think you should remove ;
[09:56:44] <helyeah> fadeIn();
[09:56:51] <taplar> it's inside a function, that's fine
[09:56:53] <WebDevB> Hey guys, i've got a weird issue... I'm working on a page that submits a simple AJAX post to the server the strange thing is if you browse to this page the submit button doesn't work but if you're on this page and you refresh it it works... Any ideas/
[09:56:59] <helyeah> hmm sorryu what console say
[09:57:00] <helyeah> ?
[09:57:17] <Xatenev> nothing otherwise I wouldnt come here :P
[09:57:26] <Xatenev> the doc states I can apply a callback
[09:57:29] <Xatenev> as the 2nd or 3rd parameter
[09:57:32] <taplar> so the panel fades?
[09:57:38] <Xatenev> yea it fades out correctly
[09:57:45] <taplar> and $('.en') exists?
[09:57:47] <helyeah> Xatenev:  fiddle?
[09:57:50] <Xatenev> taplar: yup
[09:58:02] <Xatenev> Its all owrking correct, just the fadeIn doesnt happen as callback
[09:58:03] <taplar> what's the relation of en to panel-group?
[09:58:23] <Xatenev> taplar: you dont get the problem I think
[09:58:26] <Xatenev> it fades in and fades out correctly
[09:58:47] <Xatenev> but the fadeIn happens instantly, even though the fadeOut isnt finished yet
[09:58:59] <Xatenev> doc states I can do .fadeIn( [duration ] [, complete ] )
[09:59:07] <taplar> oh
[09:59:12] <taplar> are there more than one panel groups?
[09:59:18] <Xatenev> two
[09:59:22] <taplar> so one is already hidden
[09:59:28] <Xatenev> yea im switching between two
[09:59:33] <taplar> so it would fire it's finish immediately
[09:59:40] <Xatenev> oh
[09:59:55] <Xatenev> so the fadeOut doesnt check for the function to be finished but checks for the visibility of the element?
[09:59:58] <Xatenev> thats weird Oo
[09:59:59] <WebDevB> helyeah that's it there isn't anything in the console... I can't even see the request in firebug... Refresh and it work.
[10:00:07] <taplar> your selector is on both of them
[10:00:18] <taplar> i'm assuming your really only wanting to fade out the visible one
[10:00:53] <helyeah> JS doesnt guarantee the order if you execute more than one function right?
[10:00:53] <taplar> if you don't already have the visible one selected, maybe: $('.panel-group').filter(':visible').fadeOut(400,function(){$('.en').fadeIn();});
[10:00:59] <Xatenev> taplar: yea that its
[10:01:02] <Xatenev> thats it*
[10:01:04] <Xatenev> works now
[10:01:18] <Xatenev> I just switched the first selector where the fadeOut was attached to
[10:01:43] <Xatenev> taplar_brb: good catch, thanks
[10:35:47] <helyeah> taplar:  can i ask something?
[10:36:07] <helyeah> did i beef up well?
[10:36:23] <taplar> your getting better
[10:38:10] <helyeah> hmm
[10:38:17] <helyeah> yea it seems
[10:38:31] <helyeah> i learnt "beef up" quickyl
[10:38:35] <helyeah> thats nice
[10:38:55] <helyeah> i have to find a way to boost up my development skills
[10:39:20] <helyeah> i guess the way is to get better is focuing on frameworks
[10:39:23] <helyeah> am i right?
[10:40:29] <taplar> frameworks are a part of it, but not all of it
[10:40:48] <taplar> frameworks help standardize your code base so things are similar
[10:41:02] <taplar> and they reduce how much logic you have to write yourself
[10:41:06] <taplar> boiler plating
[10:41:10] <Uhkis> now we only need to boost taplar's grammar skills
[10:41:20] <taplar> lost cause
[10:41:25] <Uhkis> :D
[10:41:54] <Uhkis> what does "beef up" mean?
[10:41:56] <taplar> developer skills are more code recollection, understanding of concepts, and ability to debug
[10:42:07] <taplar> improve or get stronger
[10:42:35] <taplar> developer skills == logic and problem solving
[10:42:47] <helyeah> i guess i kinda have that skills
[10:43:04] <Uhkis> in this case, problem solving doesn't mean: ask irc :D
[10:43:10] <taplar> ^
[10:43:20] <Uhkis> even though that does get the problem solved sometimes
[10:45:33] <helyeah> i am better now
[10:45:38] <helyeah> fortunately
[10:46:01] <helyeah> in my first time i really asked some stupid, basic stuff
[10:46:21] <helyeah> i will be better by the time project comes
[10:47:44] <matthewbe> hi
[10:47:56] <matthewbe> how do I know what kind of event has been fired?
[10:48:10] <matthewbe> e.g. $(document).on('keyup change','#someElement',function() {
[10:48:26] <taplar> e.type maybe
[10:48:27] <matthewbe> in this callback function, how to know if it concerns a change or keyup event ?
[10:48:33] <matthewbe> ah i'll try
[10:48:44] <taplar> but if your concerned with which one it is, probably best to break it apart
[10:48:51] <helyeah> dont forget to use e parameter in your function()
[10:50:31] <taplar> you're
[10:50:41] <Uhkis> no taplar nooo :D
[10:50:45] <taplar> ;)
[10:51:20] <Uhkis> so, what would be a decent way to store a huge object
[10:51:30] <taplar> in my pants
[10:51:33] <taplar> what?
[10:51:39] * AwkwardCough 
[10:51:52] <Uhkis> taplar: try some imodium
[10:52:08] <helyeah> why someone knows which event is firedd
[10:52:11] <helyeah> i dont understand
[10:52:44] <decx> what for Uhkis
[10:53:03] <Uhkis> decx: for example saving a js game
[10:53:27] <decx> localstorage
[10:53:34] <Xatenev> Uhkis: @16:43:11 LOL
[10:53:47] <decx> i use these helpers: https://jsfiddle.net/decx/rqxvemgj/
[10:54:23] <taplar> is Storage local or session?
[10:54:29] <decx> local
[10:54:54] <Uhkis> Xatenev: huh?
[10:55:03] <taplar> i use something kinda like that with an exists and a remove function
[10:55:29] <Xatenev> Uhkis: your message on 16:43:11
[10:55:38] <Uhkis> i've been overthinking this quite a bit :D
[10:55:51] <taplar> i don't have timestamps but i'm assuming that the imodium comment
[10:56:26] <Uhkis> i guess it was the dont ask irc comment?
[10:56:33] <Xatenev> Uhkis: yes.
[10:56:39] <taplar> ah
[11:04:10] <matthewbe> thank you
[11:05:33] <SuperRoach> Hello :) I'd like to know how to change content in a div, without affecting a div inside there. I have a code sample here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BKEWqr I'd like to change the word "lower"
[11:07:29] <taplar> o_O
[11:07:42] <taplar> can't be changed in the source?
[11:08:09] <SuperRoach> Well, I'd like to do it dynamicly (it's a scoreboard, transitioning from one value to another)
[11:08:52] <taplar> why?  typically dynamic stuff happens when things should conditionally happen or be a certain state.  or the things themselves are created dynamically
[11:09:00] <taplar> is there ever a case where it should be lowercase?
[11:09:57] <SuperRoach> Yeah, they are normally created dynamicaly - but that code sample is the code I spit out for each cell/score. I trigger a score change, so I'll need a way to change the text
[11:10:22] <SuperRoach> Lowercase? the syntax wouldn't matter.
[11:10:34] <taplar> and you can't change your logic that creates them dynamically to put them capitalized already?
[11:10:56] <taplar> maybe i'm misunderstanding you
[11:11:17] <taplar> you say you'd like to change 'lower'
[11:11:23] <taplar> how?
[11:11:28] <SuperRoach> the capitalization doesn't matter - In that demo, "upper" is visual effects, so the grey box will say "lower", then "ok" post the fx
[11:11:40] <SuperRoach> I'd like to change the text of #lower
[11:11:51] <taplar> ok, so wrap it in a span and change the text of the span
[11:12:08] <SuperRoach> oh duh. that's great.
[11:19:22] <SuperRoach> Works excellent. Thanks taplar. If anyone's interested, the code along with using jquery queue and dequeue is here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZWZeZg
[11:20:22] <taplar> you don't need the not() part
[11:20:32] <taplar> #upper isn't a span
[11:21:22] <SuperRoach> ah yes, sorry that was old code from before.
[11:34:33] <Kishimaro> Hello does anyone use TableSorter?
[11:44:47] <acetakwas> Hello
[11:44:49] <acetakwas> http://pastie.org/10835937
[11:44:59] <acetakwas> Why doesn't the alert work please?
[11:45:04] <taplar> $(document)
[11:45:16] <taplar> or just $(function(){ ... });
[11:45:27] <decx> it's the universes way to tell you to stop using alert
[11:45:40] <taplar> wait you have a variable up top
[11:46:00] <taplar> console errors?
[11:46:32] <Uhkis> lol decx
[11:48:43] <acetakwas> What's happening please?
[11:48:55] <taplar> any console errors?
[11:48:56] <acetakwas> Please help. This thing is making me crazy
[11:49:04] <acetakwas> I always have issues using $.ready
[11:49:10] <acetakwas> taplar::  No
[11:49:26] <acetakwas> This is what I'm trying to do: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898130/check-if-a-user-has-scrolled-to-the-bottom
[11:49:40] <acetakwas> Specifically: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15382570/1650240
[11:49:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/skxsfcee/ the logic is fine
[11:50:34] <_TWG_> Can I remove more than one class with .removeClass() ?
[11:51:08] <taplar> according to the docs, yup
[11:51:23] <taplar> space separated
[11:51:38] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[11:53:06] <acetakwas> taplar::  Perhaps it's affected by some other script?
[11:54:56] <taplar> "It should probably be pointed out that this requires Underscore.js"
[11:55:11] <taplar> you got that included too?
[11:55:15] <acetakwas> taplar::  No
[11:55:27] <taplar> so i'm not sure how your console doesn't show errors then...
[11:55:34] <acetakwas> But the snippet I posted is jQuery
[11:56:37] <acetakwas> Thanks though
[11:56:47] <acetakwas> I'll go with another answer on the page.
[11:57:02] <decx> use the last one that's the only good one
[11:57:23] <taplar> i'm not sure why that statement is there.  i don't see any underscore
[11:57:42] <bango2> ok can someone help me figure out why clicking the X works, but clicking Register as New Technician doesnt?  you can see the calls being made in the console http://www.bootply.com/3caFZC0hcw
[11:58:41] <taplar> some of your methods are outside of your doc ready.  might be the issue
[11:58:56] <taplar> *your click binding that is
[11:59:20] <bango2> js is loaded last anyway, so shouldnt really be an issue
[11:59:40] <bango2> my whole js block is loaded last in symfony
[12:00:22] <bango2> confirmed not the issue
[12:00:36] <acetakwas> decx::  Thanks
[12:01:05] <acetakwas> decx::  Sorry
[12:01:10] <acetakwas> The one with no upvotes?
[12:01:49] <acetakwas> decx::  ^
[12:02:21] <TECFALL> how would i write this so it works in < ECMA 6?
[12:02:21] <taplar> bango2: so what's the desired effect when clicking those buttons?
[12:02:26] <TECFALL> var page = location.pathname.split('/').filter(part => part.length).pop().toLowerCase();^
[12:02:33] <bango2> call the 3 functions
[12:02:34] <TECFALL> getting an error on =>
[12:02:36] <bango2> taplar
[12:03:13] <taplar> so if i click register as a tech it should call all three functions?
[12:03:28] <bango2> correct, because it has the same class click event delegation
[12:03:33] <bango2> asn the x button
[12:03:37] <bango2> or so i think
[12:03:54] <taplar> ?
[12:04:03] <taplar> no
[12:04:09] <taplar> neither have the delegate filter class
[12:04:23] <bango2> can you explain that?
[12:04:37] <taplar> .on('click', '.findTechModalDismissButton', function() {
[12:04:44] <taplar> neither of those two buttons has that class
[12:05:41] <bango2> well, the x button does, its bizarre that the other one doesnt, it does in my atom code i just copy and pasted
[12:05:43] <bango2> wait 1
[12:06:03] <acetakwas> taplar::  Do you agree with decx
[12:06:05] <acetakwas> ?
[12:06:20] <taplar> i wasn't paying attention, :P
[12:06:29] <acetakwas> I don't know they're referring to the one with no upvotes.
[12:06:34] <taplar> decx knows his shit
[12:06:41] <acetakwas> They say, the last one on the page.
[12:06:47] <decx> yep
[12:06:50] <decx> that's the one
[12:06:56] <acetakwas> Okay
[12:07:09] <decx> cant you tell by it being one line with just js insted of 5 wrapped jq objects ^^
[12:08:01] <bango2> taplar, ok, im defining a class section twice in the second button
[12:08:07] <bango2> thats why it kept getting removed
[12:08:11] <bango2> thanks for helping me debug
[12:08:19] <taplar> good deal
[12:14:30] <acetakwas> decx::  I'm having an issue yet again
[12:14:36] <acetakwas> It says `elm.onscroll`
[12:14:47] <acetakwas> Should I just use `window.onscroll`?
[12:14:49] <taplar> elm is the Element
[12:15:03] <acetakwas> I am not scrolling the `div` itself.
[12:15:09] <taplar> so window or document or body
[12:15:27] <taplar> or something.  just not a jQ object
[12:15:30] <acetakwas> taplar::  Okay
[12:26:50] <z1haze> im working on this old ass website at work, not really allowed to add new functionality to it but theres an issue its having with jquery-ui dialogs
[12:27:05] <z1haze> on chrome it renders fine
[12:27:20] <z1haze> but on firefox and ie it adds like left -3000px so its way off screen
[12:27:35] <z1haze> any ideas?
[12:28:03] <robertmaxrees> probably some bad positioning somewhere on the page.
[12:34:09] <_TWG_> Can I watch for window resizing and fire a function if it hits a specific width or smaller?
[12:34:33] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ sure, though I'd make sure you can't use media queries for it instead.
[12:34:53] <_TWG_> What do you mean?
[12:35:07] <robertmaxrees> make sure you can't use CSS instead.
[12:35:14] <z1haze> robertmaxrees: can you tell me where jquery-ui calculates its abs position from?
[12:35:15] * taplar gets prepared for the mind blowing
[12:35:23] <z1haze> because its all done inline
[12:35:25] <robertmaxrees> since resize handlers are funky and can perform like butt.
[12:35:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i have no idea.  i'd have to go through the source.
[12:35:50] <z1haze> damn
[12:35:51] <robertmaxrees> you don't have position: relative; set on the body tag, right?
[12:36:10] <z1haze> the think is chrome it works fine
[12:36:12] <_TWG_> Well I'm using bootstrap and I'm setting the height of a div base on what the height two are are that are in the same parent div.
[12:36:15] <z1haze> let me see
[12:36:54] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that doesn't really matter heh.  chrome isn't necessarly the most consistent browser in the world ;)
[12:37:01] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ are you trying to make them all equal height?
[12:38:26] <_TWG_> I'm setting the height of the 3rd div based on the window height - div1 - div2.
[12:38:44] <robertmaxrees> that seems odd.  whyfor?
[12:38:53] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't set them all using percentages instead?
[12:39:36] <_TWG_> I have a list that expands inside the 3rd div.  The only way that I found I could keep the list from expanding outside of the div was to find the height and set it.
[12:39:51] <robertmaxrees> and the div itself scrolls i assume?
[12:39:57] <_TWG_> Yes
[12:40:05] <robertmaxrees> because you can totally set the height using percentages and then avoid using JS at all.
[12:40:51] <_TWG_> My other div's have a lot of other stuff in them so i never could find a good % that worked.
[12:41:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'm lost, but OK :)
[12:42:29] <_TWG_> With twitter bootstrap div's don't match each other's height if they are in the same row.  I've alway been told to use JS to fix that.
[12:42:51] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that means, but OK :)
[12:43:08] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can attach a resize handler, but you want to be careful because they can fire dozens of times per second, so you want to run your selectors before the handler and throttle/debounce it.
[12:43:32] <taplar> another option with css could be to set their display: table-cell
[12:43:41] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's a good idea.
[12:44:14] <_TWG_> If you have a div with class row and then two div's inside it with col-sm-2 and col-sm-10 and 10 is 1000px in height due to the content, if you try to apply a color the col-sm-2 and want it to be the same height as col-sm-10 I've always been told in the bootstrap forum/irc channel to use JS.
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:44:41] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: what's so funny?
[12:45:10] <_TWG_> Thanks taplar I will do that now.
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> ignore me.  i've been having a rough time lately and just find it interesting when people provide descriptions of code instead of just making a fiddle.

[13:32:44] <Calinou> better play QuakeWorld
[14:08:22] <PlanC> is there any way to see if there is any visible content inside a div?
[14:08:32] <PlanC> the div always has a bunch of iframes and other divs
[14:08:34] <taplar> define visible?
[14:08:39] <PlanC> that it's blank
[14:08:45] <PlanC> if it's blank I want to remove it
[14:08:57] <taplar> lol, define blank
[14:09:24] <PlanC> as in nothing visible inside the div
[14:09:45] <taplar> lol visible can be different things
[14:09:53] <taplar> it could be hidden in which case it's not visible
[14:09:58] <taplar> or it could be off screen
[14:10:02] <taplar> also not visible
[14:10:08] <taplar> what are you referring to
[14:10:27] <PlanC> no it's visible
[14:10:33] <PlanC> there's no display:none;
[14:10:44] <PlanC> but inside there is no visual content
[14:10:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:11:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could .filter() children i guess?
[14:11:13] <robertmaxrees> but it really depends.
[14:12:21] <PlanC> it's difficult to explain
[14:12:26] <PlanC> basically I'm playing around with these ad codes
[14:12:32] <PlanC> sometimes when there's no ad displayed
[14:12:48] <robertmaxrees> you have an empty container?
[14:12:52] <PlanC> exactly
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> you could'va just started with that.  plenty of us have experience with those kinds of things :)
[14:13:10] <PlanC> in those cases I want to hide the div as it's useless to have an empty box
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> are you specifying a height on those containers?
[14:13:24] <PlanC> yeah, I guess
[14:13:29] <PlanC> I am, yes
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> becauce you shouldn't need to.
[14:13:34] <decx> it's easy, leave the div at the ads fixed size and add some tearjerker adblock text as background
[14:13:45] <taplar> lol
[14:13:46] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:14:10] <PlanC> decx: that's one way haha
[14:14:15] <PlanC> not sure how much that'll help though
[14:14:24] <taplar> "You blocked our ads.  [ kitten picture ] God has killed a kitten.  I hope your happy."
[14:14:28] <robertmaxrees> also: you won't be able to know if/when the ad loaded.
[14:15:41] <PlanC> no not sure how to do that
[14:16:01] <PlanC> earlier I used to check for <iframe>, <img> and <object>
[14:16:13] <robertmaxrees> but you can't know if the load has already happened or not.
[14:17:02] <PlanC> the ad code is always fully loaded when the script runs
[14:17:21] <PlanC> so it's always fully loaded when I run the script checking the ad div
[14:17:24] <robertmaxrees> but the iframe contents may not be.
[14:17:31] <robertmaxrees> buuut what to i know ;)
[14:18:21] <PlanC> iframes are bit tricky indeed as you can't access the contents inside or know when they're loaded
[14:18:33] <robertmaxrees> well, that's not entirely accurate, but yeah basically.
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> you don't know when the iframe itself has been injected, etc.
[14:18:47] <PlanC> but luckily I've noticed that they're either set to display:none or have their heights and widths set to 0 when they're empty
[14:20:34] <PlanC> hm
[14:42:57] <PlanC> alright, found a simple solution
[14:43:26] <PlanC> if($('#adContainer').children(':visible').length == 0) { console.log("no ad"); }
[14:44:20] <robertmaxrees> 2 things - never use ==, and 0 is falsy, so you can just do  if (!$('#adContainer').children(':visible').length) { console.log("no ad"); }
[14:45:31] <PlanC> you're definitely right about that
[14:45:49] <PlanC> took the code from here
[14:45:50] <PlanC> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10382439
[14:46:05] <robertmaxrees> right, very similar to what i suggested a while ago.
[14:47:06] <PlanC> you mean the filter?
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:47:35] <PlanC> ah right
[14:47:46] <PlanC> haven't used filter before so not very familiar with the function
[14:48:25] <robertmaxrees> it's a swiss-army knife.  i usually ignore selectors like :visible becuase they can be very slow.
[14:48:36] <robertmaxrees> filter with a function is fast and, imo, far more readable.
[14:49:30] <decx> that and you dont want to get bogged down by state when getting stuff from the dom
[14:50:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:15:49] <z1haze> i know this is quite out of context, but can anyone help me understand what's going on here without really knowing what these elements are? http://dpaste.com/2AXXZC9 more specifically this off stuff
[15:16:09] <robertmaxrees> that removes all event handlers for click
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[15:17:17] <robertmaxrees> you can usually avoid those entirely.
[15:17:22] <robertmaxrees> by using delegation.
[15:18:10] <robertmaxrees> usually people do that because they're accidentally re-binding their handlers and don't know about the alternatives.
[15:18:52] <z1haze> well unfortunately this entire site is a ball of garbage and i cant much change it
[15:19:02] <z1haze> its an old site so i jus thave to work with that is already here
[15:20:01] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[15:20:15] <z1haze> the client wants to add functionality for the mobile nav though that says if they click on a category once, it drops down, but if they click on it agin while its dropped down, instead of it closing, it wants to just go to that categoy page.. i kinda hcaked a solution together by checking if its toggled down then using window.location.href but i jus
[15:20:15] <z1haze> t wish i could find where its disabling the event for the anchor in the first place
[15:20:16] <robertmaxrees> can get it by doing $.fn.jquery in the console
[15:20:18] <z1haze> its like 10,000 lines
[15:20:37] <z1haze> 1.7
[15:20:40] <robertmaxrees> it's that e.preventDefault() call.
[15:20:46] <z1haze> yea but its not that call
[15:20:48] <z1haze> ive removed it
[15:20:57] <robertmaxrees> then something else is doing it, too.
[15:20:57] <z1haze> oh wait
[15:21:02] <robertmaxrees> you could have multiples doing it.
[15:21:07] <z1haze> yea see, they have prevent default in several places for the same elemnt
[15:21:09] <z1haze> yep
[15:21:28] <z1haze> so my solution does work but it just seems wrong
[15:21:50] <robertmaxrees> what's your solution?  check if it's already open and if not, open the menu, otherwise go  to the page?
[15:21:59] <z1haze> yea basically
[15:22:11] <z1haze> but i have to use window.location.href to get to the page
[15:22:17] <z1haze> because i cant find where its being prevented
[15:22:32] <z1haze> just doin this: window.location.href = $(this).attr('href');
[15:22:33] <robertmaxrees> you could use your dev tools to see what handlers are bound to that element.,
[15:22:42] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[15:22:51] <z1haze> ive never learend how to debug js in the tools actually
[15:22:57] <z1haze> which tab
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> which browser's tools are you using?
[15:23:11] <z1haze> chrome
[15:23:31] <robertmaxrees> see on the right where you have "Styles"?
[15:23:39] <robertmaxrees> there's an "event listeners" one.
[15:27:53] <z1haze> does the off('click' ... mean remove any click event?
[15:27:59] <z1haze> or remove all events and add a click event
[15:28:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[15:28:26] <robertmaxrees> "If a simple event name such as "click" is provided, all events of that type (both direct and delegated) are removed from the elements in the jQuery set."
[15:34:00] <z1haze> so what event is it responding to inside the body of it then
[15:34:24] <robertmaxrees> $cache.firstLevel.off("click").click(function(e) {
[15:34:41] <robertmaxrees> that's removing all click handlers for  $cache.firstLevel and then attaching a new click handler to all of those
[15:34:41] <z1haze> makes no sense though.. if off removes it.. theres no event firing to hit that?
[15:34:47] <z1haze> or does the click event do that
[15:34:56] <z1haze> what makes this happen though
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> the event always fires fwiw, but this code immediately re-binds a click handler.
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:35:02] <robertmaxrees> .click()
[15:35:08] <z1haze> click $(el).click() says when you click on el
[15:35:16] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:35:25] <z1haze> this is off().. so its removing.. theres no click event
[15:35:27] <robertmaxrees> the code you provided does .off('click').click()
[15:35:29] <robertmaxrees> yes, there is.
[15:35:42] <robertmaxrees> there is a click event binding that gets first right after the .off()
[15:35:42] <z1haze> so its removing old ones and adding a new one
[15:35:45] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:35:48] <z1haze> thats goofy, right?
[15:35:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:35:55] <robertmaxrees> i already explained this earlier lol
[15:36:02] <z1haze> haha sorry
[15:36:07] <z1haze> anyway, im accepting this solution

[16:56:40] <thebope> Hello I'm writing a basic jQuery plugin. I'm using .scroll to add and remove classes based on an offset value and I
[16:58:31] <thebope> Damn enter button. Every time. I'd like to use a selector like $(".my-class") within my "this.scroll(_.debounce(function() { $(".my-class").each(...) } )" in my "$.fn.scroller = function( options )" but I'm not sure how to pass a reference to jQuery into thete
[16:58:52] <thebope> this refers to the window
[19:53:58] <compact> http://pastebin.com/5wWT63RU <--- any idea why i keep getting updateClock is not defined
[19:55:18] <shoky> compact: because it's not global and calling setTimeout/Interval with a string evaluates it in the global scope. never call setTimeout with a string. do this instead:  setInterval(updateClock, 1000)
[20:03:25] <compact> ok thanks
[21:27:06] <ABM_Dan> Say I have a function that I want to fire 1 second after a button was pressed, but pressing the button again resets the timer, what's the best way to do this in a way that's flexible and allows me to hook it to different events without the timers interfering one with the other?
