[03:56:03] <blitz-_> How do you move DataTables controlls (ie paginating, filter etc) to a specific div using jquery? I tried appending the result_wrapper but it gives error if i reload the table.
[04:07:33] <baako> hi guys. https://jsfiddle.net/baako/t8gdcy4d/1/ usign jquery how do i get the value in data-formname and data-id as well has the data-cvv and also the data-saved-card-id
[04:08:21] <baako> the thing is none of them element names is unique and i need to get those for the related accordion if that makes sense
[04:08:46] <baako> so when you click on "place my order" it should get those information
[04:41:34] <baako> i have tried this https://jsfiddle.net/baako/227Laak0/1/
[04:42:17] <baako> but no lock. i do not want to post the form because i want to get the data and get it via ajax
[04:52:23] <hghodke_> Hi.. I need to capture images from 360 degree panoroma image.. Please help
[04:53:54] <Uhkis> baako: https://jsfiddle.net/227Laak0/2/
[04:55:34] <baako> Uhkis, hi thanks but that is restricted because in your example you are attaching the event to only SavedCard1
[04:55:58] <baako> the could be more than 1 forms if the user has more than 1 card saved
[04:56:10] <Uhkis> just loop them all
[04:56:47] <Uhkis> wait, actually
[04:57:46] <Uhkis> just use form instead of #id
[04:59:26] <baako> Uhkis, one more thing please $(this).data("formName") isnt pickin up input data-formname="paypalform-bottom"
[05:01:18] <Uhkis> because this is probably the window object
[05:17:05] <sharax> hi friend
[05:17:46] <sharax> i use http://jqueryui.com/slider/#hotelrooms
[05:18:23] <sharax> i need change input onclick value after slide
[05:22:22] * AdamPDotty reads dada
[05:29:09] <sharax> how to get the value selected in this jquery slider !?
[05:35:21] <sharax> friend
[05:35:33] <sharax> friends
[05:35:41] <sharax> please help
[05:40:27] <AdamPDotty> $('#minbeds').val()
[06:06:54] <Cork> sharax: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-value
[06:07:04] <Cork> or http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values for multi handle sliders
[06:11:52] <baako> Uhkis, so how will i get those values please
[06:12:20] <baako> i have looked at the event listner and cant find it
[06:29:18] <Cork> baako: you would have to select the element
[06:29:49] <Cork> $(this) on line 17+ is the same as $(window) cause you don't have a function scope
[06:30:19] <Cork> $(this).data('saved-card-id') for example might be what your looking for
[06:30:24] <Cork> uh...
[06:30:35] <Cork> * $('#accordion').data('saved-card-id') for example might be what your looking for
[06:31:04] <YamakasY> is it possible to empty a cache with this.cache(identifier) ?
[06:31:35] <YamakasY> I mean it's set like that so I need to empty that one
[06:38:01] <harry1> Using $window.location.href - if I want to pass a variable in the url which is a string, should i encode it first or serialize or similar?
[06:40:03] <AdamPDotty> I suppose you mean escape(query_string).
[06:42:53] <harry1> AdamPDotty: thanks that worked
[06:43:35] <AdamPDotty> the function will ignore @*/+ though
[07:08:44] <Cork> harry1: also if you want a to generate a key value pair in the string i recommend using $.param({})
[07:09:34] <Cork> meaning instead of doing url + '?key=' + value + '&key2=' + value2
[07:09:53] <Cork> just do url + '?' + $.param({ key: value, key2: value2 })
[07:15:36] <baako> sillyslux
[07:21:55] <konrados> Morning. I funny question arrived to my head (if this is ok in English). Will I be able to get orange color from red and yellow if I'll be using them alternately. And well, I can't, here is my code: https://gist.github.com/konrados/3be2779482de284fce877a7dfa69cc42/edit current lcd have 60hz right? here I change the color  every ~1 ms, so why can't I get orange?
[07:29:08] <konrados> ^ here is a working code: http://plnkr.co/edit/REERDl0WxVTXnSZDe8Y4?p=info
[07:31:42] <Cork> konrados: no you would have to set them on different elements
[07:31:54] <Cork> when you set one color the other one will be replaced
[07:32:31] <konrados> Cork I know, this is what I *wanted* to achieve.
[07:33:05] <konrados> have you seen this: http://plnkr.co/edit/REERDl0WxVTXnSZDe8Y4?p=info - I want orange
[07:33:45] <Cork> konrados: https://jsfiddle.net/qcc1zh04/
[07:34:57] <Cork> and for orange https://jsfiddle.net/qcc1zh04/1/
[07:35:01] <shoky> konrados: also your setInterval timings are too slow, see http://plnkr.co/edit/eyGSSPxUT91DRguE5pb9?p=preview  it's kinda brown ;S
[07:35:38] <Cork> also don't use setInterval for things like this
[07:35:42] <Cork> user requestAnimationFrame
[07:36:05] <konrados> Cork thanks, I know I could do this, but I wanted to trick my eyes :) but thanks for the requestAnimationFrame I'll read about it.
[07:36:12] <Cork> setInterval will suck the life out of the users computer for no good reason
[07:36:13] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame
[07:36:49] <konrados> shoky thanks, but it doesn't work on my monitor :(
[07:37:41] <shoky> good thing you don't have a good reason to do it, then ;)
[07:37:48] <konrados> Thanks Cork, I didn't know about  requestAnimationFrame
[07:38:19] <konrados> shoky indeed:)
[07:39:13] <Cork> konrados: also https://jsfiddle.net/qcc1zh04/2/
[07:49:19] <baako> Cork, apart from the on("submit") https://jsfiddle.net/baako/227Laak0/3/ what else can i use. i cant use the submit in my application because its a one page app and what happens is that it refresh the page which i dont want it to do
[07:49:51] <Cork> baako: just do event.preventDefault() in the submit event
[07:49:56] <Cork> you SHOULD use submit
[07:50:08] <Cork> else you will give broken experience for ppl
[07:50:31] <baako> Cork, even with e.preventDefault(); it still reload the page
[07:50:56] <Cork> then the event handler isn't finding the form
[07:51:28] <konrados> Cork. cool o_o that's what I meant :)
[07:51:41] <Cork> baako: if the form is added after you bind the event handler it won't find the element
[07:51:49] <Cork> baako: then you need to use delegated event handlers
[07:52:24] <baako> Cork, the form is defo added before the event handler
[07:52:47] <Cork> baako: then you shouldn't get the problem you describe
[07:53:14] <Cork> the only explanation is that the selector isn't finding the form so the code never runs
[07:53:44] <baako> Cork, when the application loads
[07:54:02] <baako> the form is loaded but hided
[07:54:14] <Cork> baako: where you bind the event handler
[07:54:28] <baako> the event only come into page when the user have got to the stage where the form needs to do something
[07:54:31] <Cork> right before it run console.log($('same selector').length)
[07:54:39] <Cork> and make sure the number is > 0
[07:55:24] <Cork> also if you use an id, make sure it isn't in use somewhere else
[07:55:47] <baako> Cork, when the page load it is 0
[07:55:57] <baako> when i navigate to where the form is it is 1
[07:55:57] <Cork> told you :)
[07:56:05] <baako> i knew that :D
[07:56:55] <baako> what do i do Cork
[07:57:08] <Cork> delegate the event handler to a static parent
[07:57:27] <baako> i have to go now back in 2 hours
[07:57:34] <Cork> also make sure you have the code in a ready wrapper ($(function() {}))
[08:15:04] <Cyclohexane> Hey, I'm using a WYSIWYG editor but it's producing XSS. User enters: &lt;svg onload=alert('xss')&gt; that gets saved to the DB (as-is), the editor runs this.$textarea.val() which returns <svg onload=alert('xss')> and hence XSS shows. Any tips on how to solve that?
[08:26:55] <AwkwardCough> try $textarea.text() instead
[08:30:31] <Cyclohexane> AwkwardCough: this seems to be a simplified version of what it's doing https://jsfiddle.net/jz3u8o1b/
[08:40:02] <AwkwardCough> https://jsfiddle.net/jz3u8o1b/1/
[08:40:57] <AwkwardCough> setting with text() escapes the string so it will not execute
[08:49:55] <Pari> hi
[08:50:40] <AwkwardCough> hello
[08:59:33] <baako> Cork, am back. what type of delegate do i need in this case?
[09:00:06] <baako> isnt delegate the same has the .on()
[09:01:18] <Cork> baako: no delegate isn't the same as on
[09:01:30] <Cork> baako: delegate is something you can do with on
[09:01:39] <Cork> but it depends on how you call it
[09:01:57] <Cork> baako: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:02:34] <baako> Cork, the example in the link
[09:02:39] <baako> $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a", function( event ) {
[09:02:48] <baako> isnt it the same has $('form').on('submit', function(e){
[09:03:10] <baako> or do i need to use http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:03:23] <Cork> no
[09:03:49] <Cork> the first add an event listener on #list listning for events from <a> elements inside it
[09:04:02] <Cork> your one looks for form elements and binds events on it
[09:04:14] <Cork> if the form in your case doesn't exist nothing gets added
[09:04:27] <Cork> if the <a> element doesn't exist doesn't matter
[09:04:36] <Cork> if it later gets added inside #list it will still be caught
[09:04:57] <baako> so what does this do $('form').on('submit', function(e){
[09:05:25] <baako> so instead of me using the form in the selector
[09:05:37] <baako> i should use maybe the main div wrapper class?
[09:05:42] <baako> e.g.
[09:05:51] <baako> $('.main').on('submit', 'form' function(e){
[09:06:45] <taplar> if main is static and the form is dynamically created at a future point, sure
[09:06:55] <taplar> though, that probably wont work
[09:07:07] <taplar> as by the time the submit bubbles out of the form, :s
[09:07:23] <baako> taplar, the form is created in the form
[09:07:28] <baako> future*
[09:07:39] <taplar> sure, but read my other statements
[09:08:19] <baako> "as by the time the submit bubbles out of the form, :s" dont understand it
[09:08:42] <taplar> so usually the point of binding on submit is because you want to do something, maybe some validation, and potentially cancel the submit
[09:08:54] <taplar> if it's already bubbled out of the form, it's too late to do that stuff
[09:09:27] <baako> taplar, when the form is generated the button always get generated
[09:09:55] <taplar> ok, don't listen to me.  try it and see how it goes
[09:10:08] <baako> taplar, you are tell me the possible issue
[09:10:18] <baako> am no possible solution
[09:10:39] <taplar> what is the problem your trying to solve?
[09:10:57] <baako> $('#main').on('submit', 'form', function(e){
[09:11:03] <baako> happens to work
[09:12:30] <baako> back in an hour
[09:12:39] <baako> thanks taplar and Cork
[09:13:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dbtk4m7v/
[09:13:29] <taplar> as I was saying, if you delegate bind on submitting the form, you have to be aware that you will not be able to cancel the event
[09:14:04] <taplar> meaning if the submit will cause a page transition, that transition will happen regardlessly
[09:15:37] <taplar> huh, or maybe that's not right.
[09:15:45] <taplar> looks like it's just doing the onsubmit, :s
[09:16:39] <taplar> weird
[09:24:35] <baako> taplar, yep
[09:56:26] <SimpleName> how to control <object> swf</object> play or pause
[09:56:32] <SimpleName> use jquery or javascript
[09:56:45] <SimpleName> I find there is no play function on <object> element
[09:57:35] <taplar> you might try ##javascript
[10:03:24] <Cork> SimpleName: it depends on content you load into the object
[10:03:36] <Cork> it has to expose javascript methods
[10:04:04] <Cork> unlike <video> <object> is a generic container that can load anything from flash to a webpage
[10:04:10] <Cork> (or an image)
[10:05:04] <SimpleName> ham, is there any example
[10:18:29] <baako> hi again https://jsfiddle.net/baako/227Laak0/5/
[10:18:47] <baako> the console.log isnt showing undefined
[10:21:18] <AwkwardCough> isn't?
[10:21:54] <baako> AwkwardCough, hi, yea it isn't getting those values.
[10:23:14] <AwkwardCough> well your lookups for the data elements are not correct. look to see what your data() stuff is on.
[10:27:17] <baako> AwkwardCough, what you mean by " look to see what your data() stuff is on."
[10:27:38] <baako> the data stuff is on an input
[10:28:06] <taplar> your looking for one data-* on the #accordion, but it doesn't have any data elements
[10:28:18] <taplar> neither does #pay
[10:28:50] <AwkwardCough> ^ that, selectors are non-existent for the data you are inquiring about
[10:29:33] <AwkwardCough> sorry, what I said is inaccurate
[10:29:59] <AwkwardCough> the data element is not on the ids you are looking for
[10:31:03] <baako> AwkwardCough, even if i put it out of it still nothing
[10:31:11] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/227Laak0/6/
[10:31:35] <baako> those console are outside the delegate still no log
[10:31:39] <AwkwardCough> when you do $(selector).data() your looking for a data-* on that element, not a nested element
[10:33:43] <baako> i see thanks AwkwardCough
[10:33:51] <AwkwardCough> :)
[10:35:19] <hendry> hi, what's the most modern way of doing a JSON request to a relative url like "foo/json"? $.post( ?
[10:36:19] <baako> AwkwardCough, but for  console.log($('#accordion').data('saved-card-id')); because the data-saved-card-id exist in multiple forms how do i pick the one which is attached to the clicked button on the form?
[10:37:00] <taplar> in your form binding, 'this' is the form that is submitting.  so you can do $(this).find('elementWithTheDataField').data()
[10:37:40] <taplar> hendry: with ajax you can use whatever, $.get, $.post or the basic $.ajax
[10:38:20] <AwkwardCough> baako, you could do the find() off of the common class 'addItemPo'
[10:39:01] <baako> AwkwardCough, thank you again
[10:50:01] <hendry> taplar: thanks
[10:51:38] <baako> can you set a function perimeter to be null by default?
[10:52:35] <taplar> if you don't pass it in it will be undefined i believe
[10:57:12] <decx> is function perimeter a fancy word for scope? ^^
[10:57:54] <baako> taplar, for example function getInfo(a, b, c){ }
[10:58:07] <baako> so if i call the function and dont pass in c
[10:58:13] <taplar> it will be undefined
[10:58:24] <baako> will that break the code
[10:58:30] <taplar> depends on your logic
[10:58:42] <taplar> you can do if (c) { ... }
[10:58:48] <taplar> and it would only execute if c is truthy
[10:59:05] <andrewSC> hi all
[10:59:15] <baako> c is an optional agrument
[10:59:43] <taplar> so sure.  everything should work so long as none of your logic is assuming that c is defined
[11:00:38] <andrewSC> if I do something like $('#foo').on('click', '.bar', function(){}); then something like $('#foo').on('click', '.baz', function(){}); is that acceptable? I'm worried that I'm attaching two handlers of the same event, but with two different selectors
[11:00:39] <decx> sometimes you're better off passing an options object instead
[11:01:04] <taplar> andrewSC: that's fine
[11:01:09] <andrewSC> taplar: kk thanks
[11:01:11] <taplar> so many andrews in this room...
[11:01:14] <andrewSC> lol
[11:01:26] <taplar> kept tab completing to other usernames
[11:01:37] <andrewSC> heh
[11:25:14] <harry> i'm trying to pass a string in a url param that contains a period
[11:25:29] <harry> I have used encodeURIComponent and escape but both terminate the wring at the period
[11:25:37] <harry> is this by design or a bug?
[11:25:56] <taplar> show us what your trying?
[11:27:19] <harry> $window.location.href = frontbaseurl+model+'/logout/'+encodeURIComponent(data.data.message);
[11:28:49] <taplar> what is the value of data.data.message?
[11:31:04] <harry> Password successfully saved. Please login with your new password.
[11:31:33] <harry> Password%20successfully%20saved.%20Please%20login%20with%20your%20new%20password.
[11:31:51] <taplar> ok, so your issue is probably that your putting that on the url as part of the path, instead of a value of a key
[11:32:03] <taplar> try something like
[11:32:16] <taplar> $window.location.href = frontbaseurl+model+'/logout/?message='+encodeURIComponent(data.data.message);
[11:34:28] <taplar> periods are special when it comes to paths, if your familiar with directories and the use of '.' and '..'
[11:38:28] <_BigWings_> can someone tell me why 'this' refers to my list object in the ToggleSelect method, but it is undefined in the IsSelected method?
[11:38:34] <_BigWings_> http://www.pasteall.org/69277/javascript
[11:39:30] <robertmaxrees> it's all about invocation context.
[11:39:48] <robertmaxrees> how does ToggleSelect get called?
[11:40:43] <_BigWings_> var bla = new avf.List();
[11:40:55] <_BigWings_> bla.Add(myFirstObject)
[11:40:59] <robertmaxrees> right, and then how do you call ToggleSelect
[11:41:08] <_BigWings_> bla.ToggleSelect(myFirstObject)
[11:42:18] <_BigWings_> I just didn't know it was possible to have 'this' work correctly in the first method, but be undefined in the second
[11:47:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's all about invocation context.
[11:47:39] <robertmaxrees> it depends on how things get called.
[11:55:53] <NTQ> There is an initialisation routine of a third party library I use that looks like this: https://nopaste.me/view/efa3c37f
[11:55:53] <NTQ> I need to call this init routine after refreshing some tabs I load with jQuery Tabs. Is this possible without changing that foreign library or code duplication?
[11:56:40] <NTQ> I do not understand what $(function() { ... }); does.
[11:56:49] <robertmaxrees> NTQ that's a document ready.
[11:57:06] <robertmaxrees> just a shorthand for $(document).ready()
[11:57:33] <NTQ> Thank you. So I simply have to fire a document-ready-event again?
[11:57:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:57:43] <robertmaxrees> you can't really do that anyway.
[11:58:02] <robertmaxrees> abstract out the code you want to run again and explicitly call it.
[11:58:48] <decx> you didnt post the init
[11:58:51] <decx> just the wrapper
[11:59:46] <robertmaxrees> NTQ also, there's l;iterally no reason to use that code like that.  the outer function is totally unnecessary.
[12:01:17] <NTQ> The code is the table_sorter.js from Plone CMS.
[12:01:25] <robertmaxrees> show us more of your code then.
[12:02:24] <NTQ> That's the whole code I want to reload after I added a new table to the DOM: https://nopaste.me/view/4d361ff1
[12:03:58] <decx> that's a bigger mess than the simple table sorter i wrote
[12:04:01] <decx> it's a miracle
[12:04:56] <NTQ> I know. But I have to work with for now. Later these routine will be optimized or replaced I guess.
[12:08:52] <NTQ> I think the best idea would be to copy the code in my own script directory, disable the official one and change it to match my request.
[12:10:05] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:10:39] <robertmaxrees> you realize that you could just copy the relevant part of that file and call it a day, right?
[12:10:58] <taplar> could he?  the sort method is scoped to that closure
[12:11:08] <NTQ> Exactly
[12:11:16] <robertmaxrees> oh - i didn't see that part.
[12:11:18] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[12:11:20] <taplar> yep
[12:11:24] <NTQ> It's terrible :D
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> that's gross.
[12:13:18] <NTQ> Thank you very much. Work is over. Maybe see you tomorrow.
[12:14:07] <taplar> needs some luvin to expose some methods
[12:14:33] <taplar> cause after all, when you love, you expose yourself
[12:14:48] <taplar> that's shakespear right there
[12:14:57] <AwkwardCough> its something alright
[12:18:05] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:26:13] <groundup> I seem to be having a scope issue and I can't figure it out. http://pastebin.com/1SRmymKJ trying to get orgs outside of that function
[12:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you can't since it doesn't exist.
[12:26:43] <robertmaxrees> wait where do you declare orgs?
[12:26:50] <groundup> Let me update it...
[12:27:29] <groundup> http://pastebin.com/bubfjkGK
[12:28:04] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[12:28:11] <robertmaxrees> it's because you're using an async function.
[12:28:16] <robertmaxrees> getJSON uses ajax.
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> so you're accessing things before the call finishes
[12:28:52] <groundup> ah!
[12:29:13] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the getJson call finishing needs to be passed in that callback.
[12:30:10] <groundup> Thanks robertmaxrees. I totally forgot about that
[12:30:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:31:44] <Gsham> im able to use console.log on a selector, but when i got to add on('change')... nothing happens i cant bind an event
[12:31:47] <Gsham> it ignores it completely
[12:32:02] <robertmaxrees> Gsham try to console.log($('someselector').length);
[12:32:04] <robertmaxrees> what do you get
[12:32:08] <Gsham> its a dropdown select tag
[12:32:15] <Gsham> ok. hold
[12:32:44] <Gsham> 0
[12:32:46] <Gsham> ur so smart
[12:32:54] <Gsham> i guess its not avaliable yet?
[12:33:02] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready?
[12:33:14] <Gsham> i tried htat one before.
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> is the element dynamically created?
[12:33:36] <Gsham> i can try again. it in function ($){}(jQuery)
[12:33:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not a document ready.
[12:33:49] <Gsham> ok. got it
[12:33:53] <robertmaxrees> $(function() {/* your code here */});
[12:33:53] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[12:34:14] <Gsham> im attaching on to a script that already exists so i may need to make a seperate ready funciton
[12:34:28] <robertmaxrees> that sentence makes me worry.
[12:34:32] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying?
[12:35:53] <Gsham> im using WordPress customizer
[12:36:03] <Gsham> it runs the script when changes happen
[12:36:14] <Gsham> and the script is being output in the footer
[12:36:19] <Gsham> so why should it need document ready
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:36:51] <robertmaxrees> you didn't give me any details about your setup, so there's no way for me to know what to suggest.
[12:36:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:37:24] <Gsham> what info can i give you?
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> i get the feeling the selector is wrong or your element is getting dynamically created.
[12:39:02] <Gsham> probably the latter. my script works if i put it in the console
[12:39:07] <Gsham> after the page is rendered
[12:39:13] <robertmaxrees> so you don't know?
[12:39:38] <robertmaxrees> either way, you might need to use delegation or wrap your code in a doc ready.
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> or both.
[12:41:06] <Gsham> ill give it a shot
[12:47:15] <Gsham> still the length is 0 after document is ready
[12:47:31] <robertmaxrees> is the element made in an ajax callback or something like that?
[12:47:39] <Gsham> so i guess its being updated dynamically but i cant create an event until after that
[12:47:48] <robertmaxrees> actually, you can bind.
[12:47:53] <robertmaxrees> you just bind to an ancestor that DOES exist.
[12:47:56] <robertmaxrees> and use delegation.
[12:47:59] <Gsham> maybe. its done by WordPress. its beyond my knowledge
[12:48:15] <Gsham> i tried select.on('change', 'select'
[12:48:16] <robertmaxrees> try selecting parents and see which one exists on pageloda.
[12:48:28] <robertmaxrees> right, just doing that doesnt' guarantee anything.
[12:48:32] <Gsham> should i use body?
[12:48:47] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid it if possible, but if you have no other option.
[12:49:52] <Gsham> grr body doesnt either work.
[12:50:08] <robertmaxrees> then you have another problem.
[12:50:14] <robertmaxrees> and something is very broken :)
[12:53:25] <Gsham> hmmm. there must be a logical explanation. body.length returns 1
[12:53:31] <Gsham> so i know htats wokring
[12:53:39] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:53:48] <Gsham> now im trying $('body').on('change', '#customize-control-top_layout select', function() {
[12:53:57] <Gsham> nope no working
[12:54:03] <robertmaxrees> try just "select"
[12:54:05] <robertmaxrees> what happens
[12:54:55] <Gsham> there are other selects on the page
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> just try.
[12:55:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying leave it like that
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> gotta troubleshoot, yo :)
[12:55:32] <AwkwardCough> baby steps
[12:56:03] <Gsham> i understand i just didn't want to mess with other stuff. ok yeah no nothing
[12:56:16] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else fundamentally broken in your page.
[12:56:49] <Gsham> well im not getting an errros and all other js sowkrs
[12:56:53] <Gsham> works
[12:57:03] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you put a console.log() before your binding?
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> does it show?
[12:59:47] <Gsham> console.log what? just like that? nothing
[12:59:55] <robertmaxrees> console.log("foo");
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> anything.
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you can see it.
[13:00:39] <Gsham> yes i can
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, something is fundamentally broken.
[13:01:55] <Gsham> ahhhh
[13:01:58] <Gsham> i know whats wrong
[13:02:14] <Gsham> the javascript file is output inside an iframe
[13:02:26] <Gsham> i have no way of reaching the thing i want
[13:02:28] <Gsham> which is outside
[13:02:34] <robertmaxrees> well, you do.
[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> unless it's cross-domain
[13:02:55] <Gsham> no itsmine
[13:03:18] <robertmaxrees> if the iframe and parent window are on the same domain, you can access the parent window from withinthe iframe.
[13:03:32] <Gsham> cool. how
[13:03:50] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726816/how-to-access-iframe-parent-page-using-jquery
[13:03:56] <Gsham> i mean im guessing i can use wp.customize objecrt whcih they create but i cant find any selector in there
[13:04:12] <robertmaxrees> because you don't use that.
[13:08:22] <decx> what are you doing
[13:08:54] <robertmaxrees> even better - why is your code in an iframe?
[13:09:22] <decx> wp customizr has its own method to attach change events on the setting
[13:24:40] <z1haze1> hey I have an issue with my page in mobile mode. the footer navigation sections are slide/toggle but when i slide one down the scrolling of the page is completely dicked up and im not sure what's causing it. mind taking a look? http://demo.web.solstice.demandware.net/on/demandware.store/Sites-RockportUS-Site
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> it's the weird fixed positioning you're hitting on that free shipping banner
[13:27:17] <robertmaxrees> oh, no, on the search bar.
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> your calculation is off for when that should fire.
[13:39:22] <thebope> Hello, I'd like to select all elements with a class, which also do not have a class which ends with mobile, I tried ".my-class:not[class$='mobile']" but to no avail
[13:39:44] <thebope> can I do it in a single selector or do I need to filter after getting all instances of .my-class?
[13:40:25] <robertmaxrees> so for starters, https://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[13:40:35] <robertmaxrees> :not([class$='mobile']")
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> but i'd use .filter() with a function.  or change the way you're generating your markup to get better classes on there.
[13:41:40] <thebope> yea maybe I'll just do it with the classes.. hmm
[13:41:41] <thebope> It
[13:42:17] <thebope> woops sorry. It's not the most versatile I guess to do it with classes because if someone changes the viewport it might hit the wrong elements... hmm. Alrighty, thanks robertmaxrees
[13:43:47] <robertmaxrees> you want to use classes, just not the way you are right now :)
[13:44:54] <thebope> yea robertmaxrees but I'm trying to prevent a resizing of the viewport from leaving multiple sets of the same element visible...
[13:45:03] <thebope> but yea that makes sense
[13:45:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to look at using responsive CSS techniques.
[13:52:36] <thebope> Not this sprint, I
[13:52:52] <thebope> I'm not going to refactor the whole code base to use flex for instance ;_)
[13:52:57] <thebope> I
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> sure, but this particular problem could be pretty quickly solved without making the problem worse.
[13:53:39] <thebope> I have divs for mobile and divs for desktop I need to distinguish between them
[13:53:45] <decx> media queries have been standard for years
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:54:08] <thebope> Sure... I understand that
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> media queries are super simple to implement and will likely fix this problem without you needing javascript at all.
[13:54:32] <thebope> I need to hide based on the page offset
[13:54:47] <thebope> unfortunately I'm probably using jQuery and javascript for this
[13:55:11] <robertmaxrees> what does offset have to do with desktop vs mobile?
[13:55:35] <thebope> Nothing... the webpage itself has different element divs for mobile and desktop
[13:55:43] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:55:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:55:51] <robertmaxrees> so we're talking about fixing your responsive problems.
[13:56:06] <thebope> lol, you might be... I'm just going to fix this problem for now
[13:56:17] <robertmaxrees> right, so fix it with css.
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> no refactors required.
[13:56:34] <thebope> what do you mean? fix what with css?
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> you said you're trying to hide/show things based on window size using js.  you can do that with css pretty trivially.
[13:57:47] <thebope> No, I'm trying to hide and show divs (that are hidden and shown based on window size) by page offset on scroll event
[13:58:18] <thebope> I certainly know about media queries for page size this would be the wrong channel for that question anyways ;-)
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> so you want to control that visibility using both offset and window size?
[13:58:55] <thebope> I suppose so yes
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:59:12] <robertmaxrees> " I'm trying to hide and show divs (that are hidden and shown based on window size) by page offset on scroll event"
[13:59:16] <decx> window.scrollX,window.scrollY, window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight give you a viewport rectangle that you can run against your elements
[13:59:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to parse that sentence.
[14:00:24] <Cork> thebope: showing based on window size is doable with media query, but you can't detect scroll or offset in css
[14:00:27] <thebope> So yea the document looks like (<div.mobile.hide-on-scroll></div> <div.hide-on-scroll></div>) And I want to show the proper elements when you scroll to a certain point, (on hide I just hide them all)
[14:00:44] <robertmaxrees> Cork we already established that.
[14:00:54] <robertmaxrees> there was some confusion about wtf was going on :)
[14:00:54] <thebope> Yea, that's why I'm using jQuery .scroll() to listen and .scrollTop() to grab the offset
[14:00:55] <thebope> lol
[14:01:03] <decx> use waypoints if you cant figure it out yourself
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> btw you want ot be careful with scroll event listeners.
[14:01:09] <decx> or what was that popular lib called
[14:01:23] <thebope> I use debounce to reduce the amount of times it runs the function robertmaxrees
[14:01:35] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> just making sure.
[14:01:44] <thebope> It's a function in underscore to prevent the function from running a billion times lol
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:01:49] <robertmaxrees> i know about it,.
[14:01:51] <thebope> sure yea absolutely
[14:01:57] <decx> debounce just masks a badly performing function tho
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> eh, it can.
[14:02:13] <thebope> if that wasn't the most affirmative thing I've ever said on IRC I'll be damned
[14:02:15] <robertmaxrees> i still default to using one.
[14:02:57] <thebope> I would too for scroll event, it might just be a badly performing function but that may be the best option as far as I can tell
[14:03:16] <decx> i'm inclined to link my 6000 div lookup script ^^
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> why not fix the perf AND use a debounce? (Shrug) the world may never know.
[14:03:35] <thebope> I think I've seen this decx haha, I've been 'roun these parts before
[14:03:57] <thebope> the performance? I was just going to use a low debounce
[14:03:59] <decx> for posterity https://jsfiddle.net/decx/z95roz0r/2/
[14:04:00] <thebope> like 100ms
[14:04:50] <thebope> hmm that's not the one I saw a while back, you've done quite a few of these thousand element fiddles decx?
[14:05:03] <decx> not that i remember
[14:05:28] <thebope> I used to remember you being a great help a couple of years ago when I was just starting on this journey towards jQuery enlightenment
[14:05:47] <robertmaxrees> true jquery enlightenment is know when to not use it.
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:06:12] <Cork> so true
[14:06:15] <decx> i reached enlightenment with css
[14:06:21] <decx> box-shadow: 0 0 15px yellow
[14:06:30] <Cork> :D
[14:06:49] <thebope> yea absolutely robertmaxrees
[14:07:27] <Cork> btw as a continuation, they are specing media queries for scroll position :)
[14:08:42] <decx> just for above fold or active in viewport like my attempt
[14:08:44] <thebope> yea I noticed that
[14:08:57] <decx> i remember hearing about it years ago
[14:09:07] <thebope> I didn't reach enlightenment I just moved to back end ;-)
[14:16:48] <goddard> anyone know why .html() is returning false?
[14:17:38] <robertmaxrees> have an example of that happening?
[14:17:50] <goddard> does closest() return outside a span block as well?
[14:17:59] <robertmaxrees> lol.
[14:18:14] <robertmaxrees> .closest() starts at the current element and retrieves the first element that matches your selector.
[14:18:26] <decx> html never returns false specifically, it either returns a string or undefined
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:18:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qnn9xkyd/
[14:19:19] <goddard> yeah it is returning specifically undefined
[14:19:28] <decx> then your selector is wrong
[14:19:34] <robertmaxrees> because you selector isn't matching anything.
[14:19:39] <robertmaxrees> undefined and false are different fwiw.
[14:19:49] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet your .closest() isn't doing what you think it is.
[14:20:43] <goddard> robertmaxrees: ill bet that as well
[14:21:59] <goddard> var test = $(e.target).closest('div.grab_container').html();
[14:22:11] <goddard> console.log(test) = undefined
[14:22:16] <thebope> I'll bet that as well
[14:23:20] <goddard> does that look correct?
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your html.
[14:24:44] <goddard> <a class="trigger"> <div class="grab_container"></div>
[14:24:56] <robertmaxrees> so the div is inside the a?
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[14:25:07] <robertmaxrees> closest() searches ancestors
[14:25:11] <goddard> <a class="trigger"></a> <div class="grab_container"></div>
[14:25:13] <goddard> no it isn't
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> you want a sibling of the link.
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[14:25:40] <goddard> it searces up
[14:25:41] <goddard> ?
[14:25:59] <robertmaxrees> yes, it goes through an element's ancestors.
[14:26:13] <goddard> ahh
[14:26:23] <goddard> how do i get the closest below?
[14:26:28] <robertmaxrees> you mean child?
[14:26:35] <robertmaxrees> becuase that's not what you want here.
[14:26:37] <robertmaxrees> you want a sibling.
[14:26:38] <goddard> wanna search down the html
[14:26:54] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing "direction" vs "hierarchy"
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> in your case, you don't want to search "down" - that would imply you're searching for a child of the current element.
[14:27:16] <robertmaxrees> you want a sibling of the current element.
[14:27:19] <Cork> you could use nextAll()
[14:27:28] <Cork> but ya, that will only search siblings
[14:27:55] <robertmaxrees> something tells me he has a bunch of  <a class="trigger"></a> <div class="grab_container"></div> on the page without a parent wrapping each pair.
[14:28:14] <Cork> ya
[14:28:16] <goddard> robertmaxrees: well actually i do
[14:28:33] <robertmaxrees> in that case, you could .closest() to that shared parent and then .find() the element you want.
[14:28:35] <Cork> $().nextAll('.grab_container').first()
[14:28:49] <Cork> will give you the first occurance after the target
[14:29:25] <goddard> Cork: wont that grab everything though?
[14:29:28] <Cork> alternatively you could use .next() but that will break if you ever put anything inbetween (ex. a br)
[14:29:31] <Cork> no
[14:29:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd use the .closest() .find() setup i described.
[14:29:39] <Cork> the .first() filter to the first one
[14:29:48] <decx> how many are there, might be better off having two collections and using the index of the anchor to get the right grab_container
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:29:56] <Cork> robertmaxrees: except that will lost the relation to the target
[14:30:12] <robertmaxrees> he said that he DOES have a shared containing element.
[14:30:15] <fiord> not sure how you all feel about plugins, but there's a jQuery plugin called nextInDOM that provides exactly what you want
[14:30:18] <decx> robertmaxrees: it's superfast and 0 lookups on really big sets
[14:30:21] <fiord> shared container or not
[14:30:26] <fiord> https://github.com/techfoobar/jquery-next-in-dom/blob/master/index.html
[14:30:56] <Cork> fiord: what are the difference to .nextAll?
[14:31:07] <robertmaxrees> just seems awfully silly to me to go through all that when you could use what i suggested and not care about the markup at all.
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> except for that shared parent (shrug)
[14:31:16] <Cork> you mean it searches excluding hierarchy?
[14:31:21] <fiord> yes
[14:31:26] <Cork> ugg
[14:31:29] <Cork> scary
[14:31:54] <JavaLover> can you pass to .load(); a $(document).ready() event?
[14:32:04] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:32:07] <JavaLover> or do you have to put the $(document).ready() inside the file you're .loading()?
[14:32:11] <robertmaxrees> you mean trigger document ready?
[14:32:18] <JavaLover> I mean, I want to organize my code
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> no to the first, don't to the second.
[14:32:22] <Cork> JavaLover: you can't use read for ajax calls
[14:32:30] <Cork> *ready
[14:32:31] <robertmaxrees> abstract out your code into a function you call instead.
[14:32:32] <JavaLover> and I have a google map that requires loading for a displayed google map
[14:32:39] <JavaLover> but the display relies on this page loading
[14:32:46] <JavaLover> or the id of the element gets loaded in that page
[14:32:53] <Cork> JavaLover: you would have to use the callback for when the .load is complete
[14:32:58] <robertmaxrees> right, abstract out into a function and call the function when you need to run things instead of doing it in a document ready.
[14:32:59] <JavaLover> so it's a bit disorganized that I have inside my document.ready() a call to google maps
[14:33:09] <Cork> .load(url, function() { alert('run code') })
[14:33:10] <JavaLover> when that page has really nothing to do with google maps aside from that.
[14:33:27] <JavaLover> Cork will that mean .ready() has gone off?
[14:33:36] <decx> gmaps uses window load or a specified callback
[14:33:40] <Cork> like i said, there is no ready for ajax calls
[14:33:51] <Cork> JavaLover: ready only works on initial page load
[14:33:52] <JavaLover> I know decx but asigning it before loading this page causes the bug
[14:33:54] <robertmaxrees> JavaLover document ready is not apart of the solution you want.
[14:33:57] <Cork> not when you inject code into the page
[14:34:04] <decx> that's why you do it on load
[14:34:19] <JavaLover> decx precisely what I am doing
[14:34:24] <JavaLover> and it is working, but I want to organize where I do it
[14:34:45] <Cork> JavaLover: what you could bind event handlers for when things in the page loads there content
[14:34:47] <JavaLover> because right now it relies on an internal page, and i'd like it to rely on the overall loader.
[14:34:57] <Cork> *could do is bind
[14:35:03] <decx> fiord: this nextindom plugin is terrible
[14:35:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:08] <decx> dont use it
[14:35:09] <Cork> but onload and ready won't help you
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> JavaLover you're really making this hard on yourself.  abstract out to a function.  call said function.
[14:35:26] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[14:35:37] <Cork> ya
[14:35:51] <JavaLover> but robert I would call that function after .load?
[14:35:51] <Cork> you could fire a fake event if you prefer that solution
[14:36:11] <robertmaxrees> you would call it whenever you need to.
[14:36:12] <Cork> in load
[14:36:19] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[14:36:25] <robertmaxrees> why not just call the function directly?
[14:36:28] <JavaLover> right .load('page',function(){//load map here});
[14:36:29] <JavaLover> right?
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> .load('page', yourFunctionNameHere);
[14:36:48] <robertmaxrees> done
[14:36:53] <Cork> ya
[14:36:54] <JavaLover> okay good we agree then
[14:37:07] <JavaLover> I didn't know that would work, I thought maybe it wouldn't finish loading or something
[14:37:08] <robertmaxrees> no need to declare an anonymous function there.
[14:37:17] <robertmaxrees> that's the callback for the load method.
[14:37:20] <robertmaxrees> the docs can tell you more.
[14:37:22] <JavaLover> the reason i've had problems is I have been using .getScript() previously and that thing never finishes
[14:37:32] <JavaLover> so i'm like scared now of the .load() finishing
[14:38:02] <Cork> JavaLover: getScript has problem cause they can't use the <script> events cause of old ie
[14:38:12] <JavaLover> I see
[14:38:13] <Cork> JavaLover: .load is pure xhr so doesn't have that problem
[14:38:19] <JavaLover> well thank god
[14:38:45] <Cork> well actually, depending on where you get the script from it uses xhr too + eval
[14:39:14] <JavaLover> sweet
[14:39:19] <JavaLover> that works perfectly
[14:39:21] <JavaLover> and it's organized
[14:39:21] <Cork> heh not really
[14:39:28] <Cork> eval is horrible
[14:39:40] <robertmaxrees> you keep using the word "organized".
[14:39:40] <JavaLover> is there anyway I can avoid .getScript() or would I have to rely on tags?
[14:39:56] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to load script files on an on demand basis?
[14:39:58] <Cork> JavaLover: i would load the dependencies statically
[14:40:04] <Cork> and just call the functions when you need them
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:40:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, look into requirejs.
[14:40:23] <Cork> that is by FAR the best way to organize pages
[14:40:38] <JavaLover> I can agree with that but...
[14:40:41] <Cork> window.myApp.feature()
[14:40:50] <JavaLover> hmm
[14:41:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ Cork's got a great suggestion.
[14:41:30] <JavaLover> i basically have 2 scripts so far, one is my page navigation (history.pushState) stuff and the other is google maps
[14:41:35] <robertmaxrees> or use require.
[14:41:42] <Cork> and a must if you actually want to ever use csp
[14:42:05] <Cork> ^ was what cause me to majorly restucture how i wrote pages
[14:42:20] <Cork> and i could never go back to the old dynamic js
[14:42:26] <JavaLover> hmmm
[14:42:28] <Cork> that was horrible
[14:42:46] <fiord> Cork, genuine question re: that plugin (I'm here to learn) - are there performance issues associated with searching the DOM that way?
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> though this warrants the question: you have 2 js files so far.
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> do you really need a solution like require?
[14:43:22] <JavaLover> I mean...I just want to see how it all works when i'm going over it
[14:43:35] <JavaLover> and make sure like "this is your js load" "this is your page load"
[14:43:50] <Cork> fiord: my biggest problem with it was that it is a lazy solution cause you don't want to learn to think about the dom in the correct way
[14:44:07] <Cork> fiord: and yes as the dom isn't built to be searched like that it is inefficient
[14:44:27] <Cork> that said, i didn't check the code
[14:44:29] <decx> you can just traverse yourself instead of using an overbearing plugin that rewraps stuff a thousand times
[14:44:33] <decx> don't do it cork
[14:44:55] <JavaLover> robertmaxrees, also just for control in general of like "don't load that page until js is finished loading"
[14:45:02] * Cork expects to find a setInterval ;P
[14:45:05] <fiord> Fair enough, and in the past I have used .nextAll() like you suggested in the past when I had control over the markup structure
[14:45:22] <decx> Cork: just a whole lotta parent() children() next() last() and stuff
[14:45:39] <Cork> fiord: .closest(), .find() and .nextAll() really can solve any problem
[14:45:48] <Cork> fiord: even if you can't change the structure
[14:46:00] <JavaLover> robertmaxrees, doing it this controlled way has solved a lot of variable bugs where one thing loads before the other, and just keeps a good structure.
[14:46:40] <Cork> O_o
[14:47:12] <Cork> fiord, decx: oook here is a performance problem with it, it modifies every dom element it ever checks
[14:47:26] <Cork> once when it walks the tree and one when it removes the trace again
[14:47:31] <decx> yep
[14:47:34] <JavaLover> anyways thx for advice guys, I switched it out to the .load() which is understandable now and it works perfectly, it also feels faster
[14:47:34] <Cork> so ya... not a lovely idea
[14:47:35] <JavaLover> :D
[14:47:45] <fiord> Cork, good to know, thank you
[14:48:20] <Cork> it also is a heavy user of .is
[14:48:28] <Cork> and .is isn't very performant
[14:48:40] <JavaLover> oh and as for require.js I believe what i'm using right now is based on require.js
[14:48:48] <JavaLover> let me just double check that hold on
[14:49:36] <Cork> as it finds all elements matching the selector and checks if the target is one of them
[14:49:55] <Cork> so lots of dom selections
[14:50:17] <decx> didnt you believe me when i wrote it's shit ^^
[14:50:41] <JavaLover> actually maybe not lol
[14:50:52] <Cork>  while(next.length != 0) { <-- this actually scares me too
[14:51:20] <fiord> well I guess I'll take it off my list of plugins to try out then
[14:51:35] <Cork> if for any reason length skiped zero that will be an infinite loop
[14:52:22] <JavaLover> yeah nowhere even near...
[14:52:34] <JavaLover> it's probably based on a function that "acts" like require
[14:53:11] <JavaLover> but around 6 months ago I started working with $.getScript() and the function I started with was really big & said like require(){} or whatever  and I downsized it to something simple.
[14:53:33] <fiord> I think my problem in the past was not using a filter with .nextAll() to be quite honest
[14:53:44] <JavaLover> require.js however looks very big & all inclusive of everything, my project doesn't require that lol require okay anyways again thx guys :D
[14:54:51] <Cork> fiord: ya, using .next with a filter and .nextAll without is two quite common mistakes
[14:55:20] <fiord> Cork, thanks for clearing that up, I'm gonna test it out on one of my use cases right now
[14:56:16] <Cork> i've seen countless ppl having $(this).next('.sibling').val() and wondering why they get null
[14:56:49] <Cork> when the code looked like <input><br><input class="sibling">
[14:57:24] <decx> at least it ignores nodes
[14:57:37] <Cork> you mean textNodes?
[14:57:42] <decx> ye
[14:57:57] <Cork> cause it doesn't exclude normal nodes :)
[14:58:16] <Cork> but ya... heh that reminds me of the horror from old ie
[14:58:29] <Cork> where html comments was still part of the dom tree
[14:58:54] <decx> dont remind me
[14:58:58] <Cork> lol'
[14:59:45] <Cork> or even better where a parent could be the child of its children
[14:59:52] <Cork> try walking that dom tree :>
[15:13:21] <robertmaxrees> stoked city right now.
[15:17:30] <decx> cold rainy night?
[15:17:56] <robertmaxrees> http://www.fmicassets.com/Damroot/LgJpg/10001/2232200000_amp_frt_001_nr.jpg i'm probably buying one of these in the next hour or so.
[15:18:04] <robertmaxrees> i've wanted one for a while now.
[15:18:32] <Cork> what the heck is that?
[15:18:40] <robertmaxrees> blues deluxe
[15:18:48] <Cork> ah
[15:18:49] <robertmaxrees> (guitar amp)
[15:19:32] <Cork> wonderd if it was a computer case at first XD
[15:19:36] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:20:02] <decx> talking bout blues, i was browsing youtube and found this kickass track by muddy waters and wonder if i could actually get my hands on that recording
[15:20:09] <decx> anyone know how one could go about that
[15:20:13] <robertmaxrees> what was the song?
[15:20:18] <decx> got my mojo working
[15:20:20] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> any particular version or just the studio one?
[15:20:33] <decx> with a ridiculious blues harp player
[15:20:38] <robertmaxrees> linky pls
[15:20:43] <robertmaxrees> i could maybe tell you who it was :)
[15:20:46] <decx> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qMhHnCS_0Q
[15:20:46] <b-ot> (decx) MUDDY WATERS 1966 Got My Mojo Working - length 4m 32s - 654 likes, 7 dislikes (98.9%) - 113,733 views - Blues Harp on 2012.10.20
[15:21:06] <decx> i checked a few version to download but the studio or other live versions arent even close to this one
[15:21:30] <robertmaxrees> aaaah yeah.  Cotton.
[15:21:32] <Cork> guess you could always download the youtube sound track
[15:21:39] <decx> yeah i got that already
[15:21:56] <robertmaxrees> You'll have a hard time finding this particular one for sale somewhere i reckon.
[15:22:19] <robertmaxrees> but if you like this, check out more James Cotton and Charlie Musselwhite
[15:22:22] <decx> the energy and drive is ridiculous for 66
[15:22:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:22:34] <robertmaxrees> this is actually not uncommon for the era.
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> hell, that they're sitting down is pretty surprising.
[15:22:49] <decx> well i know nothing about blues
[15:22:55] <decx> literally stumbled over this video
[15:23:05] <robertmaxrees> hah, this is a fantastic introduction.
[15:23:11] <robertmaxrees> muddy is a great place to start.
[15:24:11] <robertmaxrees> this is a great performance.  really awesome chicago style sound.
[15:25:58] <fiord> Cork, just wanted to say thanks again :) I learned something pretty valuable today from you tearing that plugin apart
[15:26:17] <fiord> Successfully wrote a function using .parents, .nextall, and .children for my purposes
[15:26:21] <fiord> along with a filter
[15:26:25] <fiord> so, cheers!
[15:26:30] <decx> good
[15:26:33] <decx> well done
[15:26:50] <fiord> you too decx - thanks
[15:26:59] <Cork> fiord: note though that most of the time when you use parents closest is what you want
[15:27:16] <fiord> Cork, Ok I'll try working with that instaed
[15:27:18] <fiord> *instead
[15:27:20] <Cork> parents is only of interest when you want all the parents matching a selector
[15:27:50] <Cork> that does happen, but not very often
[15:28:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:28:21] <robertmaxrees> cork's on fire today
[15:28:27] <fiord> ahha yea he is!
[15:28:43] <fiord> stuff like this reaffirms my decision to start coming back on IRC after many years away
[15:28:50] * fiord bows in thanks
[15:28:51] <Cork> this is same old rant i say day long
[15:29:04] <robertmaxrees> i must miss it most days then ;)
[15:29:04] <Cork> though it is usually day long cest time :)
[15:29:11] <Cork> ya
[15:29:36] <Cork> i usually stop 4h ago
[15:31:04] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:47:14] <vlt> Hello. Is there a way to cycle through a set of set of elements like $("#some_div .element") and toggle them one by one with a pause between each toggle()?
[15:47:26] <vlt> -"set of"
[15:48:16] <Cork> vlt: an async loop would solve that quite east
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/19478377
[15:48:42] <Cork> *easy
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> or some kind of recursive setup if it needs to just always run.
[15:51:33] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!!!!
[15:51:39] <robertmaxrees> !!!!!
[15:51:41] <jak2000> man can you try help me: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/overlay-2-images-images-and-wizard-png
[15:51:42] <jak2000> please
[15:51:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:51:48] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel yo.,
[15:51:49] <jak2000> any point of start pls
[15:52:23] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to accomplish?
[15:52:37] <decx> a doorbuilder
[15:52:44] <robertmaxrees> that's... not what i mean.
[15:52:52] <robertmaxrees> ask in the channel :)
[15:52:54] <jak2000> yes
[15:52:59] <jak2000> doorbuilder
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:11] <robertmaxrees> dude - what is your question?
[15:53:22] <AwkwardCough> like a mahogany door?
[15:53:37] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/pmy1nmuy/16/   <-- i try overlay this 2 images and not work see the fiddle please
[15:53:47] <robertmaxrees> "overlay this 2 images" meaning...?
[15:54:01] <decx> like a shirt generator
[15:54:03] <decx> for a door
[15:54:12] <decx> it's not something you whip out in a few lines
[15:54:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to show/hide an image based on mouseenter and mouseleaf?
[15:54:17] <decx> these things take a lot of work
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> *mouyseleave
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:56:25] <jak2000> not importante
[15:56:54] <jak2000> i want show images, and user choose.... and i am creating a new image.... with the final result.
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> with all the different options?
[15:57:59] <jak2000> is a door builder:
[15:58:34] <jak2000> first step, choose the door type, second: choose: glasstype, step 3, choose the colour...
[15:58:43] <jak2000> step 4 choose lock builder..
[15:59:02] <decx> yeah that's like 100h of work ^^
[15:59:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:59:53] <jak2000> not exist something for learn.....
[16:00:07] <robertmaxrees> heh - trust me.  i know that industry and home improvement ecommerce quite well..
[16:00:10] <decx> you send a door configuration to your server or do you just want to create an image
[16:00:29] <decx> if you just have the config then you can hack something together with draggable
[16:00:35] <decx> send that to your server
[16:00:54] <jak2000> preferibly both:
[16:01:03] <jak2000> send configuration to server(for store on a database)
[16:01:16] <robertmaxrees> getting something like that created that'll be user friendly is going to be harder than you expect :)
[16:01:17] <jak2000> and in client, give the configuration with images
[16:01:42] <decx> can you prerender every condition
[16:01:43] <decx> ?
[16:02:07] <decx> and then based on what the user chooses create a hash or whatever from that door config and just get the right image
[16:02:16] <jak2000> yes
[16:02:41] <decx> not very interactive but something you could do with a couple of selects
[16:03:08] <Cork> well not sure if it would be 100h actually
[16:03:23] <decx> not with that prerender approach
[16:03:27] <Cork> you could do it fairly fast with a canvas and bitblt
[16:03:29] <decx> but for a real builder app
[16:03:38] <jak2000> same to: http://www.roguevalleydoor.com/door-builder
[16:04:22] <AwkwardCough> that one isnt dynamic images though
[16:05:39] <jak2000> i am thinked on all compination possibles and make 1 image per combination, calculating, i need so so 5,000 images :(
[16:07:07] <Cork> jak2000: actually, you could do much of it with svg
[16:07:39] <Cork> depending on how dynamic the position of the windows are support to be
[16:08:30] <AwkwardCough> also your images are not showing up because they are not linking to the image, just their location
[16:09:27] <jak2000> its a good: door builder:   http://www.compositedoornetwork.com/builder/
[16:10:21] <jak2000> AwkwardCough you tested the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pmy1nmuy/16/
[16:11:54] <jak2000> if you test this: http://postimg.org/image/nhz8cwmvl/ and/or http://postimg.org/image/58nzxihxt/  you see an image right?
[16:12:25] <decx> it's an image on a page
[16:13:02] <AwkwardCough> try http://s32.postimg.org/a129u1ck5/image.png
[16:13:11] <AwkwardCough> for the image on that page
[16:14:19] <goddard> anyone know how to make the jquery tabs content area automatically expand based on the info in it?
[16:14:39] <Cork> jak2000: you could actually make that builder without js :)
[16:15:19] <jak2000> now test: http://jsfiddle.net/tp10454d/
[16:15:23] <jak2000> beautiful
[16:15:41] <jak2000> Cork please can you explain me a little more?
[16:16:05] <AwkwardCough> that certainly is a door. nice job.
[16:16:21] <Cork> css hover and <input type="radio"> could do all of that
[16:16:49] <jak2000> AwkwardCough yes, with a glass :)
[16:18:17] <jak2000> now how to paste this: http://postimg.org/image/yc32pt3rl/
[16:18:21] <jak2000> at the front
[16:18:25] <Cork> jak2000: but ya, i would build that around radio buttons and a form
[16:18:44] <Cork> then you have the data when they're done and you just have to submit it
[16:19:19] <AwkwardCough> jak2000 are you wanting to just build this singular image for fun or are you aiming to dynamically build a door based on user input like those examples?
[16:19:42] <jak2000> AwkwardCough based on user input
[16:19:53] <jak2000> but i undestadn(do it manually) for start coding
[16:22:36] <jak2000> my final task is: have 10 dors(diferent types), 10 lock doors, 10 glasses... and paly with it, the final issusue is paint the door....
[16:23:10] <Cork> jak2000: ya, paint is where things will get hairy
[16:23:21] <Cork> jak2000: you can't really solve that with css
[16:23:38] <AwkwardCough> yea those sites he linked just use images with different colors I believe
[16:23:47] <Cork> ya
[16:23:50] <decx> yep nothing fancy over there
[16:23:55] <decx> justa form and images
[16:24:09] <Cork> <canvas> or svg is needed there (not hard though)
[16:24:09] <decx> my 100h estimate included movable windows and shit
[16:24:42] <decx> so just prerender
[16:24:50] <decx> door1-blue.png
[16:25:09] <Cork> ya, that is how you had to do it a few years ago
[16:25:49] <AwkwardCough> wouldnt it be easier to make the images modular?
[16:26:09] <Cork> hmm actually css mask could solve it
[16:26:18] <Cork> not sure if that is cross browser yet though
[16:26:30] <decx> what for
[16:26:53] <jak2000> then decx, if i have 10 diferent doors with 8 different colors, then i need have 80 diferent doors?
[16:27:02] <Cork> instead of having transparent areas in the door for the windows you could mask the window area on the background image
[16:27:19] <decx> or just have a window image that's actually in the shape of the window ^^
[16:27:21] <Cork> and have the door that should be colored be transparent instead
[16:27:31] <Cork> then you could color it by setting a background color
[16:33:06] <jak2000> yes
[16:33:14] <jak2000> then you recomend me use better canvas?
[16:33:49] <Cork> jak2000: with canvas you can modify the images a bit like you can in an image program
[16:34:17] <Cork> or you could use svg and do it declarativly
[16:34:51] <jak2000> then the way is svg or canvas? but not both?
[16:34:54] <Cork> what you need is to have just the shadow of the door and then mask what part should be what in it
[16:35:02] <Cork> ya
[16:36:03] <Cork> thankefully replacing white with transparent isn't too hard
[16:38:08] <decx> well canvas and svg both have blending
[16:38:24] <goddard> anyone know how to make the jquery tabs content area automatically expand based on the info in it?
[16:38:52] <goddard> i have collapsible set to true
[16:38:56] <decx> yeah there's an option for it
[16:39:15] <decx> heightStyle
[16:40:50] <Cork> never seen a point to jquery ui tabs, so haven't used it enough
[16:42:04] <Cork> i can replace about 70% of its functionality with ~10 - 15 lines of css
[16:42:14] <Cork> so why use a js plugin
[16:42:14] <jak2000> cork, decx: you mean have a initial layout of a door? same as: http://postimg.org/image/4a38s1l01/
[16:42:21] <decx> like so many jqui things
[16:42:38] <Cork> actaully no
[16:42:59] <Cork> the slider, menu and dialog are really hard to remake without the code is uses
[16:43:10] <Cork> *it uses
[16:43:22] <decx> i wrote many not all didnt i
[16:44:05] <Cork> but ya, my most loved plugin from ui is the slider
[16:44:12] <goddard> decx: it appears no matter the setting the height doesn't adjust
[16:44:14] <goddard> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-heightStyle
[16:44:21] <Cork> i use that a lot, the other i often replace with simpler none js parts
[16:44:34] <goddard> if i add elements dynamically to expand the area it doesn't also expand the other data
[16:44:43] <Cork> jak2000: that is an option yes
[16:45:04] <Cork> jak2000: alternatively you can use svg/canvas effects to modify the look of the image
[16:45:28] <jak2000> ok first step, is maek the white area in transparent, right?
[16:45:35] <AwkwardCough> aye
[16:46:00] <Cork> jak2000: well first step is to store the areas where the window are suppose to go
[16:46:33] <Cork> jak2000: then you can make the white areas alpha transparent
[16:46:51] <Cork> then you mask the window images with the first data
[16:47:06] <Cork> and overlay the door on a colored background
[16:47:16] <Cork> and you have a complete door
[16:47:56] <AwkwardCough> oops ^^ listen to Cork, ignore me lol
[16:48:39] <Cork> jak2000: and both canvas and svg can do this
[16:48:50] <Cork> it is up to you if you prefer to do it in code or markup
[16:49:35] <Cork> also the "data" for the window area can be stored as a mask image or as a vektor path
[16:49:47] <Cork> again up to you
[16:50:22] <jak2000> arghh i am lost
[16:50:44] <Cork> jak2000: the door part needs to become two sets of data
[16:50:48] <decx> you'll have to put in the work
[16:51:06] <Cork> one for where the window are, and one for what the door looks like
[16:51:38] <Cork> this is needed as you need to be able to separate this info to do the other rendering
[16:52:03] <Cork> you could simplify this by creating ready made image sets like the example you showed
[16:52:17] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's what my company does.
[16:52:37] <Cork> but it is definitely possible to dynamically build it from components
[16:52:58] <jak2000> friends i am reading: https://www.patrick-wied.at/blog/how-to-create-transparency-in-images-with-html5canvas
[16:53:00] <Cork> and not very hard if you can get the raw components made
[16:53:18] <jak2000> its a good point of start (of course i listen Cork advices and others)
[16:54:41] <Cork> jak2000: not sure i would make the transparency modification on the fly
[16:55:17] <Cork> that can make things tough in unexpected places (ex where the color leaks outside the door into the background of the door image)
[16:55:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:56:18] <Cork> you normally need to manually verify that the area you get is what you want
[16:57:14] * Cork throws some neural networks at the problem
[16:57:24] <Cork> and goes to sleep o/
[17:01:51] <jak2000> Cork so so understand tahnks
[17:01:54] <jak2000> thanks
[17:04:18] <goddard> when i set css height on my tabs the content is missing
[17:04:19] <ckb> Hey guys, I have a scrollbar on my page, and I can’t for the life of me figure out what element it’s coming from. Is there a function I can use?
[17:05:14] <robertmaxrees> ckb shouldn't need it.  your inspector should be all you need.
[17:05:22] <ckb> I can’t find it :(
[17:05:32] <robertmaxrees> got it live somewhere?
[17:05:38] <ckb> I do… PM?
[17:05:50] <robertmaxrees> why can't you toss it to the channel?
[17:05:54] <ckb> I guess I can
[17:05:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:06:17] <ckb> er… you have to be logged in to see it ;\ one second
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:07:29] <AwkwardCough> yeah probably dont want to give login info in chat :/
[17:07:31] <ckb> http://gp2.cashortrade.org/ if you’re in mobile, the drawer/overlay
[17:07:44] <robertmaxrees> so i need ot be in mobile?
[17:07:52] <ckb> well < 954px
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> so the scrollbar you see for this page?
[17:08:15] <robertmaxrees> err, menu?
[17:08:33] <ckb> well, click on the menu… the scrollbar that’s behind it.. I can still scroll the page and I’m trying to prevent that
[17:08:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a different question than what you asked :)
[17:08:49] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[17:10:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11013994
[17:10:08] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> basically, set overflow: hidden; on the body.
[17:17:18] <ckb> robertmaxrees: I’ve tried that, but no dice
[17:18:37] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:18:57] <robertmaxrees> hahaha you could hack it by doing a position: fixed; on the body instead.
[17:19:08] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting height on the body btw?
[17:19:38] <ckb> Not really sure. It’s a schmorgasborg of hacks already
[17:19:58] <goddard> when i set css height on my tabs the content is missing
[17:20:08] <robertmaxrees> goddard show us?
[17:20:32] <robertmaxrees> ckb the probnlem with fixed positioning is the user will lose their scroll position.
[17:21:03] <robertmaxrees> ckb maybe look at http://stackoverflow.com/a/9280412
[17:23:09] <ckb> robertmaxrees: gonna try this thanks. exactly what I wanted
[17:23:15] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[17:29:26] <ckb> robertmaxrees: can you translate that vanilla JS to jQ? :(
[17:29:30] <ckb> haha I’m so bad
[17:29:33] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:29:37] <robertmaxrees> why not just use the JS?
[17:29:46] <ckb> okay I guess
[17:29:50] <Akimb> I'm trying trying to append some values to particular container. The data is gotten with ajax.  The problem is I get many values and they're all undefined . the response and the code can be seen here -> http://pastebin.com/r5M2qxkM
[17:30:11] <Akimb> From the JSON response it seems that the problem is not in the response itself, but how I handle it
[17:31:08] <robertmaxrees> for (var key in info) { is no good.
[17:31:25] <ckb> it’s still scrolling
[17:31:31] <ckb> I don’t think it’s the body that’s scrolling :(
[17:31:35] <robertmaxrees> ckb it might need some tweaking and css modifications.
[17:31:43] <ckb> $(“body”).scrollTop() always returns 0
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> then maybe it's a child container.
[17:32:20] <Akimb> should I try using $.each() ?
[17:32:38] <robertmaxrees> Akimb first off, are the keys going to be 0, 1, 2, etc?
[17:33:17] <Akimb> no, the json response can be seen at the bottom
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:33:44] <robertmaxrees> right, and the key for the data is a number.
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> hence my question.
[17:36:46] <Akimb> So should I make for (var key in info['0']) ?
[17:36:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:37:07] <robertmaxrees> i was going to suggest this should be an array instead.
[17:37:13] <decx> send an array and not this php array shit
[17:37:17] <decx> read my mind yo
[17:37:56] <decx> i dont even know how you create this structure but i had to deal with it too many times ^^
[17:38:54] <robertmaxrees> and for...in is a bad idea.
[17:39:22] <decx> backend guy: hey i just send you an array. { 0: {}, 1: {}} me: no
[17:39:24] <robertmaxrees> if you need to use it, add in a hasOwnProperty() check juuuust in case.  in this case though, use the right data structure.
[17:39:34] <ckb> robertmaxrees: now body.scrollTop() is > 0 BUT overflow: hidden !important; does NOTHING
[17:39:36] <robertmaxrees> decx hahahaha we actually do all that work on our own here.
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> ckb yeah you have something else going on duder.
[17:39:50] <robertmaxrees> something else is scrolling.
[17:39:57] <ckb> it’s definitely the body now :(
[17:40:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:40:39] <ckb> $("body").scrollTop(0); scrolls the bar to the top of the page now
[17:40:56] <robertmaxrees> so the body IS what's scrolling?  you have broken styles somewhere duder/
[17:41:34] <Akimb> http://pastebin.com/fEbEt97B how about this ?
[17:41:40] <Akimb> no more int as key
[17:41:45] <robertmaxrees> oerfect.
[17:41:49] <robertmaxrees> *perfect
[17:41:52] <robertmaxrees> that's an array.
[17:42:01] <ckb> the body is what I wanted to scroll in the first place..
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> now just foreach or, even better, .map()
[17:42:10] <robertmaxrees> ckb i'm really lost about your problem.
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> you want to stop the page from scrolling when the menu is open, right?
[17:42:39] <ckb> NEW PROBLEM: body { overflow: hidden; } does NOT prevent scrolling
[17:42:42] <ckb> corrrect
[17:42:53] <robertmaxrees> then you have other busted styles.
[17:43:11] <robertmaxrees> experiment to see what's causing it. i might hop over to ##css and see what they tell you.
[17:47:38] <Akimb> robert, thanks for the help, it seems to be working now
[17:49:46] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich is your gmt?
[18:09:37] <robertmaxrees> i just wanna go home and play guitar D:
[18:18:20] <decx> yo you play guitarre sweet gig dude yo can you play freebird tho

[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> Santana.
[18:19:05] <decx> right
[18:27:17] <Josh-Spartan> hi, im using datatables for a project but i need to filter a column, i need it first to show data with the words "Washington City", and then to show the rest with 'asc', ordering with 'asc' is no problem but how can i do it with the "washington city" word, to this moment i have: "order": [10, 'desc'],
[18:27:55] <robertmaxrees> so you want a filter plus ordering?
[18:28:02] <Josh-Spartan> yes
[18:28:21] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter.html
[18:33:07] <Josh-Spartan> how can i use the .search("washington city").draw(); insde the "order": [10, 'desc'], ??
[18:33:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't really know datatables but what about that example is different from what you're trying to do?
[18:35:16] <Josh-Spartan> the example is using a search box method im not
[18:35:30] <decx> that would filter the set anyway would it
[18:35:34] <decx> you want sort priority
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> so then just use .search() and bass your string.
[18:35:41] <robertmaxrees> *pass
[18:36:34] <decx>  https://datatables.net/reference/api/order.fixed%28%29
[18:36:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i wish they'd setup an irc channel already.
[18:37:32] <decx> and an api without all methods on the left side is sacrilegious
[18:37:44] <decx> api doc*
[18:38:52] <decx> why cant i link that page
[18:38:57] <decx> what a saga
[18:39:04] <decx> damn ()
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> hahahahah
[18:39:12] <robertmaxrees> decx is cranky today.
[18:39:19] <decx> it's already tomorrow
[18:39:27] <robertmaxrees> well shoot.
[18:45:10] <Josh-Spartan> is this ok:             "order": [prefilters(search(10, "Washington City").draw()), 10, 'desc' ],
[18:46:39] <decx> well does it work
[18:46:40] <decx> ^^
