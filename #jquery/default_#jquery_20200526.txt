[00:55:54] <errorous> hello. is it possible to hook onto, for lack of better words, 3rd party ajax call, and do something when that call is completed?
[00:56:27] <errorous> as in, some other code does ajax request on button click. How can I hook onto it so that I listen for response from that ajax call
[00:56:44] <errorous> I can't change said 3rd party code
[01:08:50] <Cork> errorous: you can trigger from the ajax events jquery generate, but that's about it
[01:09:24] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[01:09:43] <errorous> Cork I tried $.ajaxSetup({ beforeSend: function(){} });
[01:09:52] <errorous> but doesn't seem to be working
[01:11:12] <Cork> errorous: are you sure there is only one version of jquery on the page?
[01:11:22] <errorous> yeah, I am.
[01:11:40] <Cork> then it doesn't look like it uses $.ajax
[01:19:33] <errorous> Cork one more question: I have that ajax call. it returns some html and adds it do the page. in said html, there's a button with onclick attribute. Also, in the jquery code that's added with .ready(), there's function foobar() {}, and button has onclick="foobar()", but it says there's no such function
[01:20:17] <Cork> errorous: .ready has no effect in ajax injected content
[01:20:28] <Cork> it just executes the code inside it directly
[01:21:15] <errorous> Cork but since I define that funciton in .ready, shouldn't it be avaialble to the injected button's code?
[01:21:16] <Cork> also event attributes has no scope so everything it accesses has to be global
[01:21:22] <Cork> no
[01:21:34] <Cork> as it will be inside another scope/function
[01:21:37] <Cork> so not global
[01:21:39] <errorous> should I define it like window.foobar = function() {}
[01:21:40] <errorous> ?
[01:21:51] <Cork> you shouldn't use event attributes
[01:21:58] <Cork> add an event listener instead
[01:22:23] <Cork> then you can scope your code to relevant sections
[01:22:34] <errorous> Cork I can't because at .ready, I don't have that button, and can't add events to dynamically added html
[01:22:50] <Cork> errorous: you can delegate the event handler to a static parent
[01:23:05] <Cork> then you don't have to dynamically add the handler
[01:23:11] <errorous> how so?
[01:23:30] <Cork> and again, don't use .ready for ajax responses, it doesn't work

[04:33:27] <Cork> IamTrying: loaded from the same domain?
[04:34:59] <IamTrying> Cork: no. https://corkServer1.webrtcserver.com accessing iFrame API from: https://corkServer0iframeAPI.webrtcserver.com
[04:35:27] <Cork> you can't do cors dom accesses
[04:35:41] <Cork> you would have to use postMessage
[04:35:56] <IamTrying> OK
[04:36:26] <Cork> make sure to validate origin in the reseaver or you will have xss voulnarability
[04:48:13] <t432> will be the correct way to detect when scroll has reached bottom? $(document).height() - win.height() === win.scrollTop()
[04:48:27] <Cork> no
[04:48:36] <t432> go on
[04:50:00] <t432> what i'm i missing?
[04:52:05] <Cork> you want to use something like document.documentElement.scrollHeight - document.documentElement.clientHeight <= 10
[04:52:17] <Cork> as the top will wiggle in quite a few clients
[04:53:04] <Cork> oh ya and of cource you need scrollTop too -_-'
[04:53:27] <t432> can i see the whole thing?
[04:53:43] <Cork> you want to use something like document.documentElement.scrollHeight - document.documentElement.clientHeight - document.documentElement.scrollTop <= 10
[04:54:12] <t432> can you explain whats going on?
[04:54:20] <t432> what each of these tings do?
[04:54:22] <t432> briefly
[04:55:03] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientHeight
[04:55:05] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollHeight
[04:55:10] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollTop
[04:59:49] <t432> Cork: do I need setTimeout to prevent duplicate triggeres?
[05:00:10] <Cork> no clue what your trying to do
[05:00:27] <Cork> but know scroll is async and not guaranteed to be "current"
[05:01:13] <t432> when scroll reaches bottom i call function which pulls data from the api,
[05:01:48] <t432> i want to prevant multiple calls to the function while scroll
[05:01:51] <Cork> well you prob have to keep a state then
[05:02:02] <Cork> and only trigger it when it goes from false to true
[05:02:33] <t432> i see
[05:02:39] <t432> that'll work
[05:03:15] <Cork> cause ya, it will fire for every update pull where your past the trigger zone
[05:13:54] <t432>  Cannot read property 'scrollHeight' of undefined
[05:14:05] <t432> if ($(document).documentElement.scrollHeight - $(document).documentElement.clientHeight - $(document).documentElement.scrollTop <= 10) {
[05:15:14] <t432> Cork ^
[05:19:51] <t432> ah nvm
[05:35:48] <IamTrying> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Fwk3Yy6VYr/ - Cork , why the line 12 not working?
[05:37:05] <Cork> you've added the event handler?
[05:37:11] <Cork> (on the reseaving end)
[05:37:36] <Cork> ah
[05:37:44] <Cork> origin is where you want to send it, not from where
[05:38:25] <Cork> so you give it the domain of the api domain
[05:38:40] <Cork> and the message handler checks the origin for the i.my.com domain
[05:44:57] <IamTrying> <iframe src='https://i.my.com/a/api.html' width='100%' height='100%' id='maincam'></iframe>  here i want to send it so i did : window.postMessage( {'task': 'test'}, 'https://i.my.com' );
[05:45:33] <Cork> well that shoud work as long as the handler is bound before you do the post

[11:29:17] <Inazad> Hi there, I have an iframe with html form, I want to be able lto get the current html value (I got input text in it). I'm not able to get the value in the fields or any changes made... How I can get the changed html value of the iframe ?
[11:29:54] <Inazad> I tried with "$('#templateFrame').contents().find("html").html()" but it doesn't return the changed values in the fields
[11:36:27] <Hoppelhase> What when you do .find("form").serializeArray()?
[11:37:33] <Inazad> Hoppelhase, gonna try
[11:37:50] <Inazad> do I need to put an id to the form
[11:38:21] <Hoppelhase> No
[11:38:46] <Inazad> empty array
[11:39:42] <Hoppelhase> Do you get any JS errors?
[11:40:07] <Inazad> no
[11:40:15] <Inazad> but I want to snap all the content of the iframe
[11:40:22] <Inazad> I don't want to iterate trough all input elements...
[11:40:31] <Inazad> how I will save the content of the  iframe value ?
[11:42:28] <Hoppelhase> Does that even work when you try to get the val() of an individual input element?
[11:43:15] <Inazad> Hoppelhase, yes
[11:44:04] <Hoppelhase> Hhm, weird

[14:32:59] <destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/q9uco6gp/ how can i filter seach if i change * to .test please?
[14:42:48] <shoky_> destramic: that .filter is not doing anything, could use .each instead.   and i guess you want:  $('.test *').each()
[14:44:38] <destramic> shoky_ as it stands it does search the whole body, but i want it to just do it for .test specifically
[14:45:26] <shoky_> destramic: yes, that's what i gave you
[14:46:03] <shoky_> change "*" to ".test *"
[14:47:30] <destramic> shoky_ i have and now it aint found anything

[16:44:55] <kittonian> hi all. I am trying to get this accordion to work they way I need it to and can't figure it out. Here's a codepen link to what I'm using.
[16:44:56] <kittonian> https://codepen.io/MightyShaban/pen/LqrCK
[16:45:24] <kittonian> I need to prevent the initial panel from opening on page load, and I need to add the functionality to allow more than one pane to be opened at a time
[16:45:32] <kittonian> other than that I have it all working perfectly
[17:08:37] <kittonian> never mind. solved it.
[17:37:33] <jak2000> hi all, basic question how to set the width of the columns on a Html table?
[18:00:31] <ark> Is there a way to run this code on page load then run again after page resize as long as it follows if($(window).width() <= 650)? It only runs after page resize and it does not matter what page size it is
[18:00:44] <ark> https://dpaste.org/jKnT
[20:24:37] <ark> How do I combine the top code with the bottom codes below? https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/gqqgux/jquery_run_on_page_load_then_run_again_after_page/
[20:30:27] <Hoppelhase> What do you mean? Just replace "Do whatever here" with your code?
[20:31:13] <ark> i tried that but it isn't working as expected
[20:31:28] <Hoppelhase> Show your code
[20:31:35] <ark> ok one sec
[20:32:49] <ark> https://dpaste.org/3pRN
[20:35:27] <ark> idk if i also needed to put the if statement right after the if statement?
[20:37:25] <Hoppelhase> That code doesn't make sense. What do you want to do when width > 650?
[20:37:45] <Hoppelhase> You are setting a lot of different handlers
[20:43:55] <ark> do not hide the nav bar and cookie bar if > 650
[20:46:20] <ark> But hide the nav bar ir less than 650
[20:46:37] <Hoppelhase> So you want to check for the width in the .on() handlers
[20:46:51] <ark> run the code on first page load then adjust based on page resize but always run again after resize
[20:47:45] <Hoppelhase> What exactly is "the code"?
[20:48:20] <ark> just the question shown in the reddit link
[20:49:52] <Hoppelhase> The thing is, your hide() functions trigger on completely different events. I don't understand why you need the resize event here, just check for the width in the handlers
[20:54:00] <ark> can you show me your solution?
[20:54:58] <Hoppelhase> I haven't even fully understood the problem yet :D
[20:55:30] <ark> my bad what do you need clarified further?
[20:57:07] <Hoppelhase> What exactly should happen when the user resizes the display, say from 800 to 500px?
[20:57:23] <Hoppelhase> And what the other way around?
[20:59:11] <ark> ok gotcha let me explain
[21:02:21] <ark> Page loads -> run code. If page size is above 650 (in this case 800) do not hide the nav bars when clicking in a form input. When resizing to 500, have a delay then hide the nav bars since the screen is mobile ready
[21:05:39] <ark> if starting out on a small screen run the code. Since small, hide the nav bars. If resizing to large screen, do not hide the nav bars
[21:05:58] <ark> but have a delay before letting the code run on the new screen size
[21:08:47] <Hoppelhase> And what is "the code"?
[21:09:25] <ark> https://dpaste.org/mCDH
[21:09:50] <ark> that code works but runs once
[21:10:41] <Hoppelhase> That code installs a lot of handlers, you do not want to run that multiple times
[21:10:48] <ark> ok
[21:17:20] <Hoppelhase> ark: Is this what you want? https://jsbin.com/xusiqomedo/edit?html,js,output
[21:18:58] <ark> holy shit yea something like that
[21:42:03] <ark> so i would have to include 'footer' and mobile-hide-show-navbar-top, mobile-hide-show-navbar-bottom the same way?
[21:48:01] <Hoppelhase> ark: This is closer to what you desribed earlier, i.e. only hide on focus events: https://jsbin.com/seyevekaha/1/edit?html,js,output
[21:49:30] <ark> ok lettme see
[21:50:35] <ark> yea that is basically it but how do i include my nav bars with specific IDs?
[21:50:40] <Sven_vB> ark, you should really have clued the people in that I already gave you a recipe in #javascript.
[21:50:44] <Sven_vB> it was <Sven_vB> ark, in your reddit link, the two triggers at the top look good. the stuff starting with "jQuery(document).ready", just remove. then search for "jquery add a class to body element" and "jquery remove a class from body element", put that in the trigger funcs.
[21:51:05] <ark> my appologies
[21:51:51] <Sven_vB> L
[21:53:16] <Sven_vB> meanwhile I also found the first half of the missing research, it's literally just jQuery('body').addClass('formfocus'); and my guess for the 2nd part is jQuery('body').removeClass('formfocus');
[22:00:43] <Hoppelhase> Sven_vB: What's the purpose of class on body?
[22:01:01] <Sven_vB> Hoppelhase, to use in his CSS media query
[22:01:56] <Hoppelhase> Ah okay, I don't know a bout media queries
[22:02:21] <Sven_vB> no prob, ark seems to know. :)
[22:02:32] <Sven_vB> basically they are conditional blocks in your CSS
[22:03:27] <Sven_vB> could you guide them to fixing the jQuery CDN problems? once they're solved, the focus script should be trivial.
[22:03:27] <Hoppelhase> Also I have to get some sleep. Good luck!
[22:03:33] <Sven_vB> oh ok. :)
[22:03:36] <Sven_vB> sleep well!
[22:03:52] <Hoppelhase> Bye!
[22:05:34] <ark> dang wanted to say ty to him/her b4 they left
[22:08:51] <Sven_vB> I think this should work https://paste.debian.net/plainh/f8094233
[22:10:13] <Sven_vB> the space behind function is an accident, you can even remove that for a microsecond faster page load.
[22:15:01] <ark> wow so all i would need to do is add the css class into the addClass and removeClass?
[22:15:32] <ark> oh wait nvm you have a variable setting cls
[22:15:48] <Sven_vB> the code should work as is
[22:16:21] <Sven_vB> you could make the background-color change with the class for testing
[22:16:59] <ark> how would it know though about the specific nav and data-role ?
[22:19:49] <Sven_vB> it doesn't. that's the beauty of it. since you don't like JS, you can do all of that in CSS now.
[22:21:23] <Sven_vB> e.g. @media (???) { body.formfocus nav[data-role="???"] { display: none; } }
[22:22:50] <Sven_vB> should have better performance, too.
[22:29:05] <ark> oooh i see i will give that a try then
[22:31:04] <ark> i am going to switch computers thanks for all the help sven_vB I will give you a holler if I run into any trouble
[22:31:50] <Sven_vB> good luck!
[23:10:27] <freespirit-girl> anyone around?
