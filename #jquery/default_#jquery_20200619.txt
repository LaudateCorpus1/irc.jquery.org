[06:42:48] <Aljone> hey all
[06:42:59] <Aljone> var forms = document.getElementsByClassName('needs-validation'); anyone knows why $(forms).serializeArray(); < gives me empty array althoug there is alot of input values inside
[06:43:17] <Aljone> forms contain only one form element
[07:15:01] <linux_daemon> hey guys, i do ajax call, and get string response, and i do this:  pattern = response.match(/<div id="cart_block".*?<\/div>/i); console.log(pattern[0]); response.replace(pattern[0], "");
[07:15:33] <linux_daemon> console.log(pattern[0]) has some string, but in response, after the replace, the string is still contained in it
[07:15:54] <linux_daemon> any ideas as to why the replace is not working?
[07:32:35] <linux_daemon> anyone?
[16:54:26] <gnstaxo> How do I get the text of a textarea? .text() doesn't get me what the user writes in it
[16:54:39] <robertmaxrees> you want the value - .val() :)
[16:54:50] <robertmaxrees> same for any other text inputs.
[16:55:37] <gnstaxo> Thank you
