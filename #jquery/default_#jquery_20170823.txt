[07:12:07] <moveax> hi
[07:12:32] <moveax> https://jsfiddle.net/5wh42awq/2/
[07:12:42] <moveax> i am trying to have a horizontal sortable list
[07:12:50] <moveax> and drag items from a draggable into it
[07:13:04] <moveax> the sortable itself works, but i have trouble to drag the draggables into it
[07:13:11] <moveax> please the my jsfiddle for details
[07:13:18] <moveax> some has a hint for me to solve that?
[07:34:53] <Cyclohexane> How does this auto sanitize input? $('#mySelect').append($('<option>', { value: value.value, text: value.text }));
[07:35:18] <Cork> Cyclohexane: you set text as text instead of parse it
[07:35:49] <Cyclohexane> Cork: so it's safe against xss then?
[07:35:54] <Cork> yes
[07:36:17] <Cork> Cyclohexane: what makes it safe is that is value.text would be html, it would be put as html in option
[07:36:20] <Cork> not as dom elements
[07:36:32] <Cork> so the html parser wouldn't look at it
[07:36:48] <Cork> (and that is why it is xss safe)
[07:37:13] <Cork> the difference is between $('<option>', { value: value.value, text: value.text }) and $('<option>', { value: value.value, html: value.text })
[07:37:30] <Cyclohexane> ok thanks
[07:43:30] <Anticom> Hi all. Does jQuery emit an event, when the .val() setter is called on an jquery object?
[07:44:00] <Anticom> Or would i have to do something like a vanillaJS MutationObserver ?
[07:44:11] <burzum2> hi
[07:44:17] <Anticom> o/
[07:44:31] <burzum> Can I shorten this or optimize it in any way? https://pastebin.com/cTbgJgr2
[07:44:40] <Cork> moveax: you can't use float: left;
[07:44:55] <Cork> use display: inline or display: flex on the waypoints
[07:44:58] <Anticom> burzum: optimize towards size / speed, performance / etc. ??
[07:45:41] <Anticom> readability / conventions would be another type of optimization
[07:45:43] <burzum> Anticom is there a way to get rid off the duplicate lines?
[07:46:10] <Cork> moveax: https://jsfiddle.net/5wh42awq/4/
[07:46:14] <burzum> Im open to suggestions for readability, but honestly JS is *always* a freaking mess for me. I havent rarely seen two libs using the same coding style :(
[07:46:34] <Cork> Anticom: no it isn't you would have to fire that manually with .trigger() if you want it
[07:46:46] <Anticom> burzum: well except for L31 and L32 you could do $(`${selector1}, ${selector2}`)
[07:47:08] <Anticom> burzum: there's probably even a JQ way of concatenating it without having to use string concatenation inside the selector
[07:47:11] <Cork> uh no
[07:47:16] <Cork> ${} isn't valid
[07:47:28] <Cork> just do password1.add(password2)
[07:47:29] <Anticom> Cork: it's valid ES6 ;)
[07:47:46] <Cork> Anticom: and that isn't safe to use yet
[07:47:53] <moveax> thanks Cork
[07:47:57] <Anticom> Cork: Well it's about my plugin once again so i can't rely on the end-users triggering an update-event of some sort on every value change
[07:47:59] <burzum> Anticom thats my guess :) Just dont know how
[07:48:03] <Anticom> so MutationObserver it is, right? :)
[07:48:15] <Anticom> burzum: Cork just gave the answer away
[07:48:17] <Cork> Anticom: then you would have to provide a separate method to update it
[07:48:25] <Cork> Anticom: won't trigger it
[07:48:26] <burzum> yes, looking it up im not that fast
[07:48:31] <Cork> cause you aren't changing the dom
[07:48:31] <Anticom> Cork: ?
[07:48:53] <Anticom> Cork: how is a .val() setter not changing the DOM?
[07:49:02] <Anticom> it's an attribute change
[07:49:03] <Cork> it updates state values
[07:49:10] <Cork> no not attributes
[07:49:14] <Cork> the property
[07:49:19] <burzum> thanks guys
[07:49:40] <Anticom> Cork: so even http://devdocs.io/dom/mutationobserver won't work with val?
[07:49:42] <Anticom> meh
[07:49:57] <Anticom> i mean i could overwrite .val() globally but that's a pretty bad idea IMO
[07:50:01] <Cork> burzum: a warning though .next() will return null if the next element doesn't match the selector
[07:50:08] <Cork> burzum: it doesn't return the next element matching the selector
[07:50:19] <Cork> Anticom: you could wrap it
[07:50:56] <Anticom> Cork: but in general that idea sucks. I mean if someone was to provide their own jquery using a CDN etc. i'm screwed
[07:51:10] <Cork> (function() { var orgVal = jQuery.fn.val; jQuery.fn.val = function(val) { return orgval.apply(this, arguments) }) })()
[07:51:19] <Cork> nope
[07:51:25] <Cork> that live extends it
[07:51:56] <Cork> if someone stores a reference to the original val function before you replace it you're screwed
[07:52:04] <Cork> but except from that it's completely safe
[07:52:23] <Anticom> Cork: well still looks a bit wonky but if it's what i have to do...
[07:52:34] <Anticom> thanks as always :)
[07:52:44] <Cork> well you could trust your users...
[07:52:56] <Anticom> Cork: you can never trust your users :D
[07:52:58] <Cork> THAT is what i would recommend as the correct solution >_>
[07:53:00] <moveax> that is doing what i need cork, thanks again
[07:53:11] <Anticom> Cork: and the correct solution would be?
[07:53:43] <Cork> provide a plugin function for setting the values, and instruct in documentation to use it to keep the plugin up to date
[07:53:48] <Cork> similarly to how jquery-ui does
[07:54:22] <Anticom> Cork: but that wouldn't be transparent to provide an additional value setter with the only addition that it fires an event
[07:54:34] <Anticom> it's an extension not a new whiz-bang feature
[07:54:50] <Anticom> hence i'd be confused if i had to use .valAndFireEvent() over .val()
[07:57:03] <Cork> Anticom: not really as i meant it would be something like $().plugin('set', value) or something like that
[07:57:30] <Cork> as overriding what .val does assumes you know the user actually wants the update
[07:57:51] <Cork> and that is normally what is annoying when you use plugins (having to fight with it to get what you want to happen to happen)
[07:57:57] <Anticom> Cork: that's supposed to be the beauty of my validation plugin
[07:58:14] <Cork> aha...
[07:58:14] <Anticom> i mean i can listen on any kind of browser events but if a value gets changed programatically it doesn't update
[07:58:43] <Anticom> the problem is, that currently the validation has to be initialized *after* the value has been set (if programatically)
[07:58:58] <Anticom> but that isn't always that easy
[07:59:12] <Anticom> becaues the current code base is scattered all over the place
[08:00:13] <Anticom> So my idea was to emit a custom event so it doesn't interfere with standard events like change etc.
[08:19:44] <Anticom> Felishia: RTFM :) "Note: jQuery does not support getting the offset coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for margins set on the <html> document element. While it is possible to get the coordinates of elements with visibility:hidden set, display:none is excluded from the rendering tree and thus has a position that is undefined."
[08:22:07] <Felishia> Anticom: actually it was weirder than that
[08:22:25] <Felishia> the element was an instance of other thing but not HTMLElement
[08:22:37] <Felishia> damn it should at least throw me a warning I was pulling my hair off uwu
[10:38:17] <poboy> ok, duders. How do I replace the contents of "current" with the contents of "incoming"?  https://jsfiddle.net/sxy3aLx6/
[10:40:38] <hlve> you ask politely.
[10:42:20] <poboy> hlve, would you please do me a favor and point out the error of my ways?  Thank you so much.
[10:57:05] <poboy> I have one other question if anyone is willing to help.  This fiddle works but in my project when I put onclick="copyIncoming()" in the i class then wrap the jquery in a copyIncoming function it does not work.  https://jsfiddle.net/70z8keem/4/
[10:57:22] <poboy> Will someone please explain why it does not work that way?
[11:00:21] <Anticom> poboy: what are you trying to do?
[11:01:09] <poboy> on that last one i am copying info from one text area to another.  the fiddle works as intended.  put just placing that in my js file in the project it does not work
[11:01:29] <Anticom> but why would you want to use onclick if you got jquery?
[11:01:37] <Anticom> like what's the use-case?
[11:01:44] <Anticom> generating this via php etc.?
[11:01:55] <poboy> i just don't know what else to use
[11:02:13] <poboy> we are displaying existing info and giving the user the option to copy that or not
[11:02:24] <Anticom> $('selector').click(function() { copyIncoming(); });
[11:02:28] <poboy> so the click the arrow which copies "legal name"
[11:03:02] <Anticom> well that copying is a one-liner ;) $('to').val($('from').val())
[11:04:49] <Anticom> Just my personal preference but i wouldn't use dom-traversal too much in your JS code because it makes your markup (a.k.a. HTML) very brittle and forces you to maintain the same element structure. so TL;DR; if you refactor your layout / html your JS breaks if you're using .parent(), .parents(), .child(), .find(), .closest(), .next() and so on and so on too much
[11:04:57] <Anticom> i'd just hard-wire those four elements up
[11:05:06] <Anticom> that way you got ultimate control about what's happening
[11:05:23] <poboy> there are more , maybe 9 or so
[11:05:35] <Anticom> so you need 9 lines of JS
[11:05:36] <poboy> i'm just very new to jquery
[11:05:45] <Anticom> that's why i'm suggesting to you to hard-wire it
[11:06:27] <Anticom> $('#to_id').val($('#from_id').val()) is basically calling the value-setter on #to_id and giving it the value retrieved by the value-getter from #from_id
[11:07:04] <Anticom> that's a very easy to understand expression and you just need it 9 times. If you get more comfy with jquery and JS in general you can still come back another day and refactor it to a more general approach
[11:07:22] <Anticom> but my recommendation would be to not over-complicate stuff as a beginner
[11:09:01] <poboy> anticom thanks for the info
[11:10:53] <Anticom> poboy: also you can build small abstractions to make those nine lines a little more pretty: https://jsfiddle.net/1nLobfrd/
[11:11:30] <Anticom> poboy: don't know how good your VanillaJS skills are but the copyFromTo is returning a function itself. So basically it's creating a function which binds the $from and $to. That way your click handler looks decent
[11:12:16] <Anticom> and if you want to make this more pretty just wrap your from's and to's into an array of [ { from: $('#from'), to: $('#to') }, ... ] and iterate over it
[11:12:27] <Anticom> then your code is decently clean but still very speaking
[11:13:21] <Keytap> Good morning gents
[11:13:40] * hlve slaps Keytap with a trout.
[11:14:00] <Keytap> Quick question.  I'm using the jQueryUI selectmenu and attempting to trigger the change event in the underlying select element.
[11:14:17] <Keytap> However simply calling change on the element doesn't seem to be working.
[11:14:29] <Keytap> Any idea why that might be?
[11:15:38] <Keytap> Additionally, calling refresh on the selectmenu doesn't seem to update it to the state of the underlying select
[11:15:49] <Anticom> Keytap: should work: http://api.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#event-change
[11:16:21] <Keytap> That's where I'm trying to trigger a change in the underlying select.
[11:16:33] <Keytap> Specifically, I'm using $(this).change() in the callback I pass there
[11:17:00] <Keytap> However the callbacks on the underlying select aren't called
[11:23:07] <Anticom> Keytap: but why does it have to be the underlying element if jq-ui offers an API for it?
[11:24:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1nLobfrd/1/
[11:28:19] <Keytap> Anticom: Legacy app.  ;_;
[11:29:22] <Keytap> Anticom: I mean, if I can find out where the ruddy change listener is being added I'll probably just move it.
[11:29:31] <Keytap> Anticom: But I haven't seen it, yet.
[11:29:36] <kiwi_88858> hi all i'm looking for menu like this one : http://tutozone.net/best-carousel-galleries.html
[11:30:18] <hlve> you should code one.
[11:30:39] <kiwi_88858> I need a model and i'll edit it
[11:30:48] <kiwi_88858> it is easyier
[11:30:59] <hlve> easier isn't always a good thing
[11:31:40] <kiwi_88858> I know but for this one it is^^
[11:32:17] <taplar> this room is also about teaching other jQuery.  not providing solutions
[11:32:22] <taplar> *others
[11:32:59] <kiwi_88858> I don't need someone to teach me, i just need a model
[11:33:00] <kiwi_88858> to edit it
[11:33:08] <taplar> then you're in the wrong place
[11:33:19] <kiwi_88858> ok
[11:33:28] <kiwi_88858> where should I go ?
[11:33:45] <octobernewbie> Hi!
[11:33:49] <Keytap> Hi!
[11:33:52] <hlve> Google, probably.
[11:34:01] <taplar> or maybe #web
[11:34:06] * hlve shudders
[11:34:31] <kiwi_88858> hlve what should I search ?
[11:34:37] <kiwi_88858> 3D menu rotate ?
[11:35:11] <octobernewbie> Have anyone know how to build drag & drop icons on an image?
[11:35:47] <Keytap> octobernewbie: Not something I've much experience with.  Sorry mate.
[11:35:55] <octobernewbie> I have one image and like 20 icons which I need to put on different possitons.
[11:36:10] <octobernewbie> I've built it with jquery ui
[11:36:21] <hlve> jqueryUI would be the route I'd go for drag&drop
[11:36:29] <octobernewbie> but when I refresh page I don't know how to put draggable items (icons) on that image
[11:36:39] <octobernewbie> with specific position of the icons
[11:36:50] <kiwi_88858> use canvas element
[11:37:50] <octobernewbie> something like that doesn't work https://codetidy.com/10500/
[11:37:55] <octobernewbie> I have already used canvas
[11:38:01] <octobernewbie> same problem
[11:38:06] <kiwi_88858> ah
[11:38:14] <octobernewbie> I can draw icons, but those images are not draggable anymre
[11:38:19] <octobernewbie> anymore*
[11:38:54] <octobernewbie> So I need to draw them on the image and make them still be draggable
[11:39:31] <octobernewbie> I'm unsure if I can use a canvas with jquery ui
[11:39:52] <kiwi_88858> which method have u used with canvas ?
[11:40:59] <octobernewbie> drawImage()
[11:41:12] <octobernewbie> with new Image()
[11:41:32] <kiwi_88858> try draggable() with konva
[11:41:44] <kiwi_88858> https://cdn.rawgit.com/konvajs/konva/1.6.5/konva.min.js
[11:42:54] <kiwi_88858> be sure to set draggable to true
[11:44:26] <octobernewbie> have you got any working example?
[11:45:15] <kiwi_88858> I don't have one in this computer, but I have made a drag and drop fuzzer for mozilla browser
[11:45:31] <kiwi_88858> but i'm pretty u can find good documentation on google
[11:45:45] <octobernewbie> ok
[11:45:51] <kiwi_88858> https://konvajs.github.io/docs/drag_and_drop/Drag_an_Image.html
[11:45:52] <octobernewbie> I'm just unsutre if that will be works
[11:46:10] <kiwi_88858> try this
[11:46:22] <octobernewbie> yeah, but I can drag my icons :) I can put possiton
[11:46:26] <octobernewbie> ok, I'll try
[11:46:33] <kiwi_88858> I didn't understand really what u wanted to make, but if u want to use drag and drog with image it's ok
[11:47:39] <octobernewbie> I need to put small icons on one image
[11:47:53] <kiwi_88858> ah
[11:47:56] <octobernewbie> and then store icons positions in db
[11:48:14] <octobernewbie> and after that I need to display that image with icons on same possitions
[11:48:41] <octobernewbie> Try to imagine photo of you familly
[11:48:44] <kiwi_88858> ok u want to a web desktop ? ^^
[11:48:57] <octobernewbie> sorry?
[11:49:19] <kiwi_88858> I meaning it's like a web desktop
[11:49:25] <octobernewbie> and then you have icons e.g. with your familly names. e.g. your brother, mother, father etc
[11:49:38] <octobernewbie> and now you want to assign icons to you familly on main image
[11:49:39] <kiwi_88858> u have a background image where u put icons and position is saved for later use
[11:49:48] <octobernewbie> exactly :)
[11:49:55] <octobernewbie> that's what I need :)
[11:50:09] <kiwi_88858> okok, i'm pretty u can do it with that
[11:50:29] <octobernewbie> with konvajs?
[11:50:45] <kiwi_88858> yes
[11:51:23] <kiwi_88858> also u want to make it with jQuery UI try to look for "drag and drop image on background" -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21773688/jquery-drag-and-drop-image-into-a-background-image-web-app
[11:51:53] <kiwi_88858> http://www.elated.com/articles/drag-and-drop-with-jquery-your-essential-guide/
[11:53:32] <kiwi_88858> if*
[11:54:38] <shisui_> jquery validate is notworking with bootstrap modal.. any idea?
[11:55:55] <kiwi_88858> it should work^^
[11:56:39] <shisui_> i have included ->  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-validate/1.15.1/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
[11:56:58] <shisui_> and everything else i have checked.. dont know where im going wrong
[11:57:56] <kiwi_88858> any inexpected result ? or output in console ?
[11:58:04] <kiwi_88858> unexpected*
[12:02:51] <shisui_> kiwi_88858: nothing.. the modal is getting closed without validation, data is not going into DB as null though..
[12:10:09] <shisui_> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=w0esgddblA ..
[12:10:18] <shisui_> can someone help?
[12:14:03] <robertmaxrees> shisui_ mind adding the rendered markup?
[12:14:11] <robertmaxrees> and adding in the necessary dependencies?
[12:14:34] <shisui_> robertmaxrees: like?
[12:15:26] <robertmaxrees> ah, poking the logs.  jquery validate in bootstrap modals.
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> i might try initiailizing jqvalidate when the modal opens.
[12:16:24] <poboy> Anticom, even when copying that fiddle line for line and changing the id names in my project, the info would not copy over.  What would cause that?
[12:17:15] <shisui_> robertmaxrees: alright, its okay.. you can add
[12:17:53] <robertmaxrees> shisui_ hrm?  just gotta add a listener for the modal open and go from there.
[12:17:55] <robertmaxrees> that should fix it.
[12:21:05] <shisui_> robertmaxrees: i dont get you.. can you add it in fiddle?
[12:21:47] <robertmaxrees> shisui_ erm, where are you getting lost?
[12:22:21] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#modals-events
[12:22:35] <robertmaxrees> just gotta listen to the show.bs.modal event,  then put the jqvalidate init in there.
[12:23:08] <shisui_> robertmaxrees: the validation is not happening.. the modal just getting closed.. i checked everything, dunno where im going wrong
[12:23:15] <shisui_> robertmaxrees: alright i ll see
[12:23:28] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[12:23:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, my guess is that the validation isn't actually on the modal itself.
[12:25:22] <shisui_> robertmaxrees: yea, i have given form an id and writing script on it..
[12:25:43] <shisui_> if u notice
[12:27:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:27:18] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap does funky things with modals.
[12:27:22] <robertmaxrees> hence my suggestion.
[12:59:36] <poboy> so if I have multiple buttons and I want one button to copy/paste from one specific field, how do I handle that?  https://jsfiddle.net/9efn3Lmr/1/
[12:59:44] <poboy> without doing the dom traversing?
[13:00:17] <poboy> I mean, I could do trigger1 do this, trigger 2 do that, but is there an easier way
[13:00:21] <taplar> you asked this earlier today
[13:00:23] <robertmaxrees> first off
[13:00:42] <taplar> i linked this guy https://jsfiddle.net/1nLobfrd/1/
[13:00:44] <poboy> yeah, I was working with what Anticom shared
[13:00:56] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs
[13:01:12] <robertmaxrees> second off - gotta use a better markup strategy.
[13:01:14] <rjCousineau> Hello.  Is there a way I can apply $('a').removeAttr('target') on all existing and future elements?
[13:01:29] <taplar> not future
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:01:36] <rjCousineau> $.ajaxSetup() ?
[13:01:39] <rjCousineau> hmmmm
[13:01:40] <rjCousineau> hmm
[13:02:10] <taplar> why not fix the markup being returned instead?
[13:02:18] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:02:36] <robertmaxrees> don't use client-side js as a thing to "fix" markup.
[13:02:41] <rjCousineau> I see. ok
[13:02:51] <taplar> especially if you do it 100% of the time
[13:02:58] <rjCousineau> its a special condition thing
[13:02:59] <Anticom> poboy: dunno what the problem in your project is
[13:03:35] <Anticom> poboy: you basically need to mod three things: the selector of the btn etc. that listens on an event like clicking and the two selectors for the element to copy from and to
[13:03:54] <taplar> Anticom: or use classes with a delegate and call it a day
[13:04:01] <Anticom> poboy: oh and keep in mind that the order matters in JS. That is you have to put the function i gave you above its usage
[13:04:15] <Anticom> taplar: he's a beginner. Let him work his way up
[13:04:24] <taplar> i'd rather he learn the right way
[13:04:33] <taplar> instead of teaching him to create tons of bindings
[13:04:35] <Anticom> taplar: IMHO there's nothing worst then diving straight into the details right away
[13:04:50] <Anticom> taplar: under the hood you need all those bindings anyway
[13:04:52] <taplar> how is delegate and classes 'deep' in details?
[13:04:55] <Anticom> just the code is a little more verbose
[13:05:09] <Anticom> taplar: think back to your first week of jquery ;)
[13:05:25] <Anticom> and potentially even vanilla js
[13:05:25] <taplar> and?
[13:05:54] <Anticom> taplar: okay i'll put it this way: try to explain to a 12 year old what a delegate is
[13:06:09] <taplar> i'm not hiring 12 year olds to work fo rme
[13:06:16] <Anticom> too bad, they're cheap :D
[13:06:16] <taplar> i'm hiring adults with adult intelligence
[13:06:39] <taplar> again, the concept of delegates and classes are not deep
[13:06:41] <Anticom> taplar: just saying that learning by doing is the best way and you have to start simple
[13:06:59] <taplar> in fact there are LOTS of people who struggle with switching to classes from ids because they were taught ids and only ids
[13:07:06] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:07:28] <robertmaxrees> also: giving the point-blank solution and then slowly explaining things that don't make sense is totally valid.
[13:08:05] <Anticom> taplar: btw when using classes over ids you have to do some DOM traversal to get things done. I previously gave the argument, that this is almost a guarantee to break your JS when you want to change your markup
[13:08:18] <taplar> both do traversals
[13:08:27] <robertmaxrees> Anticom not if you use semantic classes and structure things in a sane way.
[13:08:31] <Anticom> taplar: i mean stuff like .parent(), .next(), etc.
[13:08:37] <taplar> lol
[13:08:53] <Anticom> well i do agree with you guys. Feel free to go ahead and give your solutions
[13:08:53] <taplar> so, lets not teach people how the DOM is structured?
[13:09:13] <Anticom> taplar: i learned the hard way that doing that excessivly *will* break your neck
[13:09:22] <taplar> mmv
[13:09:51] <taplar> a good data model and relational contextual looks should be enforced when teaching
[13:09:58] <taplar> imho
[13:10:09] <taplar> instead of over using ids
[13:10:10] <Anticom> taplar: why not just jump right into custom components although unstable API. seriously i'd love to use them in production today but 1st) this isn't #js but #jquery and 2nd) IMHO it would be too complicated for a beginner level understanding
[13:10:48] <Anticom> as i said and i don't mean it as an offense but feel free and post your suggestions
[13:10:57] <robertmaxrees> Anticom that really doens't have anything to do with what taplar is saying.
[13:10:58] <Anticom> maybe i can learn somthing too
[13:11:17] <Anticom> robertmaxrees: seriously, how does mmv work with jquery?
[13:11:22] <Anticom> i actually don't know
[13:11:29] <taplar> mmv = mileage may vary
[13:11:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:11:41] <Anticom> oh i thought it'd be something like mvvm :D
[13:11:41] <Anticom> lol
[13:11:45] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[13:11:45] * Anticom facepalms
[13:11:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:12:05] <Anticom> okay back to poboy's problem
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> imho the easy solution is https://jsfiddle.net/9efn3Lmr/3/
[13:12:18] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) simple, straightforward, and not overengineered.
[13:14:00] <Anticom> btw this is what i've suggested in case you missed it: https://jsfiddle.net/1nLobfrd/
[13:14:15] <robertmaxrees> i saw that
[13:14:20] <taplar> and if he wants to repeat those inputs, it's invalid markup
[13:14:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:14:26] <Anticom> just making sure, got join/leave messages hidden
[13:14:26] <taplar> because of the ids
[13:14:29] <poboy> taplar, when I add a second button to what you linked, can you show me what you'd change?  https://jsfiddle.net/1nLobfrd/2/
[13:14:52] <taplar> poboy like robertmaxrees's, they would each have a fieldset
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:14:59] <taplar> not all be nested in one
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> fieldset around each to/from/button combo
[13:15:19] <taplar> fieldset is the 'context' of the data
[13:15:39] <taplar> within a fieldset, it contains all the information for one of your objects you are concerned about
[13:15:45] <taplar> a copy from and a copy to
[13:15:47] <poboy> ok, so that's the issue.  the incoming fields exist, then the button, then all the current fields are later
[13:16:13] <Anticom> don't want to be a jerk but i called it. https://imgflip.com/i/1ulfxi
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> heh, this is why complete examples are important ;)
[13:16:35] <taplar> lol
[13:16:40] <Anticom> :D
[13:16:43] <taplar> the js isn't broken, the mark up is
[13:16:49] <Anticom> taplar: disagree
[13:16:56] <taplar> feel free to
[13:17:03] <Anticom> if you're designing your markup to work with your js then something's wrong
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:17:15] <Anticom> it's like what bootstrap is doing and now we've got css grid
[13:17:25] <taplar> so we should write markup without considering how we will be using it?
[13:17:29] <robertmaxrees> Anticom so how is he supposed to use this with IDs and without semantic markup?
[13:17:50] <Anticom> taplar: that's not what i said. Of course you should. However you shouldn't be forced to use extra markup to make your idea work
[13:18:04] <taplar> you should write your markup to make your life easier
[13:18:07] <Anticom> because IMHO markup should be as concise and slim as possible
[13:18:12] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:18:19] <robertmaxrees> your markup should describe the data.
[13:18:22] <taplar> ^
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> a nice side-effect is that it makes it much easier to work with in JS>
[13:18:44] <Anticom> so you're always wrapping inputs in fieldsets?
[13:18:56] <robertmaxrees> only when it makes sense to group them.
[13:18:59] <taplar> maybe a span or a div or something
[13:19:03] <taplar> bootstrap likes fieldsets though
[13:19:18] <taplar> and i think that's part of why fieldsets were made a tag
[13:19:19] <robertmaxrees> markup should be semantic.
[13:19:35] <taplar> not the bootstrap thing, but to group inputs
[13:19:48] <taplar> a set of fields
[13:19:55] <Anticom> ^ agree
[13:20:03] <Anticom> however tbh i rarely use them
[13:20:13] <robertmaxrees> sure.  they're something you use when it makes sense.
[13:20:28] <robertmaxrees> like in this case - he has groupings of inputs/buttons that are semantically linked.
[13:20:41] <robertmaxrees> poboy you figure it out?
[13:21:28] <poboy> so this definitely works.  $('[name="files_current[legalName]"]').val($('[name="files[legalName]"]').val());  the brute force solution I have is write a function for each button
[13:21:43] <poboy> I won't ask stupid questions for ever, but I definitely will for awhile. ;)
[13:21:46] <robertmaxrees> poboy i gave a solution that does exactly what you want >.>
[13:21:56] <poboy> sorry, which one?
[13:22:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/9efn3Lmr/3/
[13:22:06] <Anticom> poboy: there aren't any stupid questions. There are only stupid answers
[13:22:13] <Anticom> excluding stuff you could have googled yourself :D
[13:22:34] <poboy> thanks robert, I missed that one
[13:22:35] <Anticom> at the end of the day we're all here to help and learn from each other
[13:22:57] <Anticom> poboy: btw you could "hide" the fieldsets using css if you don't want them to be displayed
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> nah.  i'm just here for the coffee.
[13:23:20] <Anticom> robertmaxrees: is there a coffee-bot?
[13:23:30] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> iii wish
[13:23:38] <Anticom> !coffee
[13:23:40] <Anticom> damn
[13:24:02] <poboy> oh, robertmaxrees, the blank fields are in a different place on the view.  that's why the fieldsets won't work I don't think
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> poboy alright, so let's rewind a whole bunch
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> show us an actual, honest example of your markup.
[13:26:23] <octobernewbie> Hi!
[13:26:28] <Anticom> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/sxy3aLx6/
[13:26:29] <poboy> https://paste.laravel.io/jExj5
[13:26:34] <Anticom> okay sort of
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> poboy markup, not the php :)
[13:27:37] <robertmaxrees> eitrher way.
[13:28:03] * taplar has a feeling that the '.row' elements will be functioning like the fieldsets
[13:28:30] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:28:37] <taplar> maybe.  hard to read
[13:29:01] <robertmaxrees> so you have a files[legalname] in incoming and then a files_current[legalName] in currentDetails?
[13:29:10] <poboy> yep
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> got full control over the markup?
[13:32:59] <robertmaxrees> 'cause there are a few ways to skin this cat.
[13:33:05] <poboy> yes
[13:33:14] <octobernewbie> Any one know how to out icons with specific position in jquery ui
[13:33:14] <octobernewbie> ?
[13:33:18] <octobernewbie> drag & drop
[13:33:32] <poboy> huge project so if I start changing too many things I'll get yelled at
[13:35:35] <poboy> oh, shit.  I should probably be able to do incoming and current on the same row then I could do the fieldset thing.
[13:35:50] <robertmaxrees> what's the UI here?
[13:36:20] <taplar> you don't have to do fieldset
[13:36:24] <taplar> it was just to show the concept
[13:36:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:36:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wm86fot2/ so here's one hacky way to do it.
[13:37:15] <poboy> i can get a screenshot but the user has incoming fields on the left and needs the ability to click an arrow to populate the blank fieldson the right
[13:37:58] <robertmaxrees> i assume the right side is its own form tho?
[13:38:12] <Anticom> cheers guys, it's beer o'clock :D
[13:39:24] <poboy> not a form just a series of input boxes.
[13:40:07] <poboy> nothing on the left is editable so the update button only works on the right side.   so it's all within one form
[13:40:27] <taplar> how many users are editable at a given time like this?
[13:40:58] <robertmaxrees> except that left-hand side is spurious data for the submit :)
[13:41:26] <poboy> https://pasteboard.co/GH0QYkP.png
[13:41:28] <poboy> just one
[13:41:50] <taplar> so your use case is a single user, with multiple inputs that you want to perform like logic upon?
[13:41:59] <poboy> yes
[13:42:52] <taplar> do the names of the current fields match the names of the incoming fields they are associated with?
[13:43:55] <poboy> yes for now
[13:44:02] <taplar> for now?
[13:44:12] <poboy> oh, the names match yes
[13:44:26] <poboy> right now it is pulling the info from incoming and populating current but that may change
[13:45:04] <taplar> ok, so i really feel like this logic is still applicable: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wm86fot2/
[13:45:32] <taplar> ignoring the markup that is causing it to be stacked vertically on itself
[13:45:48] <taplar> if you look at the buttons you will see they have a data field on them for which input should be copied
[13:46:03] <poboy> yes
[13:46:11] <taplar> in that example it's using classes
[13:46:25] <taplar> but you could also modify it to use names if you wanted.  though classes are a little faster
[13:46:35] <poboy> i'm gonna try that thanks
[13:49:35] <poboy> the names and classes are different from incoming to current though.  on the example they were the same
[13:50:10] <taplar> can you give an example of one incoming name and that current name it maps to?
[13:50:26] <taplar> r/that/what
[13:51:31] <octobernewbie> is anyone is good with jquery ui drag & drop?
[13:51:39] <poboy> name="[legalName]" / name="files_current[legalName]"
[13:51:47] <poboy> wait
[13:52:01] <poboy> name="files[legalName]"  /  name="files_current[legalName]"
[13:52:14] <robertmaxrees> can use that poboy
[13:52:24] <robertmaxrees> octobernewbie gotta fiddle?
[13:55:34] <octobernewbie> no
[13:56:01] <octobernewbie> I need to draw few draggable icons on the one primary image
[13:56:54] <taplar> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/wm86fot2/2/
[13:58:03] <taplar> it filters the inputs on their name matching either 'files[THEFIELD]' or 'files_current[THEFIELD]' depending on if it is the current or incoming
[13:58:33] <octobernewbie> robertmaxrees
[13:58:33] <octobernewbie>  how you thing? There should be a way to draw icons?
[13:58:44] <octobernewbie> with specific position with jquery drag & drop
[13:59:11] <octobernewbie> I have one primary image and some icons which I need to drop on that priamary image
[13:59:26] <octobernewbie> then I need to store positions of that icons in db
[13:59:36] <octobernewbie> and display it on another page
[13:59:58] <octobernewbie> problem is how to display icons on p. image with specific position?>\
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> octobernewbie do you need to be able to drag and drop them to specific locations?
[14:10:09] <octobernewbie> robertmaxrees
[14:10:09] <octobernewbie> I can drop my icons on any part of the image
[14:10:12] <octobernewbie> anywhere
[14:10:30] <robertmaxrees> and then you need to initialize them in those positions?
[14:10:44] <octobernewbie> but problem is that I need to refresh page and put icons on same position on the image
[14:10:52] <octobernewbie> yes
[14:10:54] <octobernewbie> but how?
[14:11:01] <poboy> fuck me up the goat ass.  still not working.  thanks anyway, guys.  you have been awesome
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> WELP
[14:11:36] <robertmaxrees> octobernewbie https://stackoverflow.com/a/7664985/923919
[14:12:15] <taplar> did he just say he had a goat ass?
[14:12:29] <poboy> haha.  it's from an Adam Sandler skit
[14:12:36] <robertmaxrees> i know that skit heh
[14:12:43] <robertmaxrees> have good mosh pitting!!
[14:13:56] <poboy> lol
[14:14:35] <octobernewbie> https://thepasteb.in/p/pghQ3v2y874tR
[14:16:21] <robertmaxrees> octobernewbie wut
[14:16:54] <robertmaxrees> how is that anything like the link i tossed out?
[14:27:41] <octobernewbie> maybe is not possible to set possition of draggable icons on droppable area
[14:27:43] <octobernewbie> no idea
[15:10:17] <poboy> ok, it's FUGLY but at least the functionality is there.  https://paste.laravel.io/543eL
[15:11:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:11:36] <robertmaxrees> why not parse the name field to get what you want?
[15:12:39] <gamblor3> hi robert
[15:12:39] <poboy> because this has to be done today and I wanted to get it done
[15:12:41] <poboy> :D
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> yikes heh
[15:16:48] <rjCousineau> poboy: type /nick Gitrdoen
[15:16:57] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:17:50] <robertmaxrees> gamblor3 dunno why you keep PMing me duder.  would really rather you didn't :)
[15:19:16] <poboy> lol
[15:19:37] <poboy> i hope this doesn't get me fired
[15:19:52] <poboy> they knew I was brand new to jquery and mediocre at php when they hired me
[15:20:03] <robertmaxrees> what happens when they add new inputs?
[15:20:21] <poboy> we go back and fix it. :)
[15:20:47] <robertmaxrees> protip™: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qomm1q9v/
[15:20:51] <poboy> this project is jacked up 6 ways from sunday.  all stuff before me.  every day there's a new fire and it's mostly fixing stuff that was done wrong in the first place
[15:21:34] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd avoid adding to that problem then ;)
[15:22:37] <robertmaxrees> check out that fiddle I just pasted.
[15:23:55] <gamblor3> which is better, mysql or mongo
[15:24:20] <robertmaxrees> depends on the job.
[15:24:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd go into channels for those two and see which they recommend for your application.
[15:26:45] <poboy> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:26:51] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[15:27:18] <gamblor3> not really
[15:27:26] <robertmaxrees> that was directed at poboy
[15:28:53] <poboy> yes, that's very helpful. thanks for taking up so much of your day
[15:31:45] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[15:35:48] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[15:49:53] <momomo> when you do jquery.find('').each(function(i, e) the e is a native unwrapped node, right? so is 'this' ... is there a way to force jquery to givbe me the wrapped fversion for one or the other ?
[15:50:10] <momomo> it's annoying as hell having to rewrap them all the time
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> momomo gotta rewrap 'em yourself sadly.
[15:51:30] <robertmaxrees> tho there are many cases where .each() is the wrong tool, as well :)
[15:54:08] <MikeD_> does that notation even have a second parameter?
[15:54:54] <onca> I aim to sort an ordered list by an attribute of the <li> list item, is this possible? I think this is the simplest approach to achieving a friendly list of artist name's, omitting 'The' while preserving their name at the sametime. Is this possible?
[15:55:06] <momomo> robertmaxrees: it's not just each. filter, and others also ...
[15:55:10] <momomo> whatis the right tool?
[15:55:41] <momomo> this must be one of the bad design decisions .. i see no reason why this cannot change
[15:57:30] <momomo> there is no reason to have both e and this to behave the same .. personally i'd like the this to be wrapped part .. always when using jquery functions .. this should give you the wrapped part .. also get(0) is so obnoxius ... a simple get() or .node attribute should give you 'native' node ... and   .length() > 0 .. althouhg i think isEmpty now exists
[15:58:02] <momomo> an option should be given to devs .. although that could break backward compatibility with plugins
[15:58:12] <momomo> not that I  use many
[15:58:18] <robertmaxrees> monokrome depends on the job.
[15:58:29] <robertmaxrees> but also: $() can be a semi-expensive operation.
[15:58:43] <robertmaxrees> so not assuming you'll need it is a good way to cut down on some overhead.
[15:59:22] <robertmaxrees> the reason 'e' and 'this' are the same is because it's bad to assume 'this' will be the element.
[15:59:36] <momomo> but it is
[15:59:40] <momomo> only native
[15:59:44] <momomo> so just give us one
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees> not always in native.
[16:00:15] <momomo> robertmaxrees: not sure what jquery does .. by it should just be a wrapping and delegation operation .. don't see why it has to be expensive ... $ = function(e)  { return new JQueryObject(e); }
[16:00:32] <robertmaxrees> that new jqueryobject constructor is expensive.,
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> also: fat arrows.
[16:00:44] <momomo> i am guessing it merges
[16:00:45] <momomo> ?
[16:00:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:00:54] <momomo> why not prototype the stuff
[16:01:07] <momomo> methods .. ? or what is expensive avout the new?
[16:01:17] <momomo> what does it do
[16:01:24] <robertmaxrees> check the source for yourself.
[16:01:34] <robertmaxrees> regardless, 'this' cannot be guaranteed to be the element in question.
[16:02:08] <momomo> yes, sure .. but for the operations in which I control .. it would be as much as a i can rely this to be native
[16:02:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:02:31] <robertmaxrees> you're ignoring bound/called functions and fat arrows.
[16:02:40] <robertmaxrees> if you don't like it, you don't have to use the lib :)
[16:02:51] <MikeD_> haha "fat arrows"  i hadn't heard them called that
[16:02:51] <robertmaxrees> feel free to put in a ticket if it's that big of a deal./
[16:02:55] <momomo> robertmaxrees: so what, just because I have an opiniooon on the part i don't have to use it
[16:03:13] <robertmaxrees> momomo don't need to be defensive duder.  just pointing stuff out :)
[16:03:14] <robertmaxrees> no big.
[16:03:16] * taplar is trying to read back to see what hte convo is about
[16:03:22] <momomo> it's just annoying as hell having to wrap the object every time .. if you then do another iteration on another sub elmeent .. you have to do it again
[16:03:33] <momomo> another parameter could be provided
[16:03:48] <momomo> or an object (map) based param
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> memory overhead (shrug)
[16:04:02] <MikeD_> momomo: if that's your biggest complaint with jquery, you probably haven't used it for long  :P
[16:04:14] <taplar> iirc, there is a third argument given that is the collection, which you could do thatThing.eq(index) to get
[16:04:32] <momomo> MikeD_: yes, let's go with that .. i've used it longer than you, probably which is why this operation is getting tiresome
[16:04:33] <robertmaxrees> tbh you talking about doing nested each calls is a code smell.
[16:04:44] <momomo> robertmaxrees: my code is nicer than yours
[16:04:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:04:53] <robertmaxrees> calm down duder
[16:04:57] <taplar> $(selector).each(function(index, element, array){  array.eq(index); })
[16:05:05] <taplar> if you so choose
[16:05:37] <momomo> not sure that's niceer than $(this), or e = $(e) , the latter which i do
[16:05:50] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:05:58] <momomo> anyhow, i was just hoping for an option
[16:06:07] <robertmaxrees> feel free to submit the idea.
[16:06:11] <momomo> it's nice to be able to just work on the property ...   chaining is nice
[16:06:12] <MikeD_> i stopped complaining about jquery... it is what it is... if you have a philosophical ax to grind, there are other libs or write your own
[16:06:23] <MikeD_> or shim jquery with functions of your own
[16:06:24] <momomo> MikeD_: i have
[16:06:33] <robertmaxrees> or submit something in github.
[16:06:43] <taplar> you could always write your own custom iterator to provide the $(e)
[16:06:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ tons of options.
[16:07:09] <MikeD_> while you're at it, fix the reversal of parameters between .each() and .map()  :)
[16:07:31] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ wat
[16:07:31] <MikeD_> i know... stop using both and use native js for those
[16:07:53] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.each and $.fn.map are the same.
[16:07:53] <taplar> still valid if your browser coverage warrents it
[16:09:41] <MikeD_> callback for each is (index, object) and map is (object, index)
[16:09:56] <robertmaxrees> $.each or $.fn.each?
[16:09:57] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:10:02] <MikeD_> sorry, i meant the parameters passed to the callback
[16:10:13] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[16:10:18] <taplar> index, element
[16:10:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:10:37] <MikeD_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[16:10:51] <MikeD_> which could also be argued is a point of potential confusion
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:11:09] <robertmaxrees> somebody explained the "why" on that one to me once.
[16:11:10] <taplar> though it does match the native map()
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> can't remember what it was though./
[16:11:15] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:11:18] <robertmaxrees> that's part of it.
[16:11:28] <taplar> forEach() and map() both use element first, native
[16:11:35] <MikeD_> haha, yeah... i just remember that whichever way I think it should be that it isn't, and the other one is the reverse
[16:11:54] <taplar> personally i prefer the element first.  i hardly ever use the index
[16:11:57] <taplar> i always use the element
[16:12:18] <MikeD_> at this point though, if i wasn't working with a team of jquery entrenched devs, i'd just give up on it and use native iterators
[16:13:58] <momomo> nowadays the reason i use jquery is becaue of the added functionalities and simpler access to things like offset, height, and find -> $() ... i mean the thought of "them" introducing a new function querySelector and querySelectorAll was enough reason for me not to ever consider using it
[16:14:11] <momomo> what a terrible name .. am i supposed to type that every time ?
[16:14:34] <taplar> what?
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> querySelector and querySelectorAll
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> can do $ = querySelectorAll; bam, done ;)
[16:15:00] <taplar> lmao
[16:15:25] <taplar> first world problems
[16:15:29] <momomo> robertmaxrees: i know .. but that's a signature that the guys who desgined it are foold
[16:15:30] <momomo> fools
[16:15:39] <momomo> and i would just enter a deep rabbit hole
[16:15:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree but OK.
[16:15:49] <momomo> never been a fan of w3 org
[16:16:08] <taplar> w3c you mean?
[16:16:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather have to autocomplete somethign than have an ambiguous name.,
[16:17:11] <momomo> robertmaxrees: which one would you autocomplete then ? to do querySelectorAll( .. you would have to type q -> tab -> A -> tab
[16:17:17] <momomo> vs $
[16:17:26] <momomo> if not space tab as well
[16:17:33] <momomo> and wait for your editor to spin
[16:17:46] <robertmaxrees> my editor doesn't really spin for autocomplete but OK.
[16:18:03] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd still rather the full querySelectorAll on account of the name is clear.
[16:18:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) not for everybody.
[16:18:40] <momomo> findAll ... for find is a alot more concise
[16:18:46] <momomo> or just query
[16:18:54] <momomo> why the selector part ?
[16:19:01] <robertmaxrees> because "find" is ambiguous.
[16:19:03] <taplar> you are giving it a selector
[16:19:13] <robertmaxrees> querySelector hints that you're querying something with a selector.
[16:19:33] <momomo> robertmaxrees: who cares about hints .. if i am using it .. i probably know what it does
[16:19:53] <taplar> which is all that matters.  self documenting code be damned
[16:19:58] <momomo> is it for stupid developers that the rest of us have to pay a price for ?
[16:20:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:06] <taplar> it's not like tons of developers use it
[16:20:12] <robertmaxrees> you seem really angry.
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> lucky for you, there's a one-liner fix to your woes!  $ = querySelectorAll
[16:20:58] <robertmaxrees> bam, done.
[16:22:02] <momomo> taplar: but come on .. if you used web development once .. and want to find an element .. you need to google for that ... once you've done that .. its known .. it's not like a newbie is going to say, hey. .i want to find an element .. no i want to query an element ... i will type query then I wander ... select with this query .. and voila ... he ends up with querySelect() haha
[16:22:07] <momomo> even that's better
[16:22:45] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) sounds like you should go talk with the W3C and the WHATWG
[16:22:52] <momomo> robertmaxrees: like I said .. if i was online and shpping for a jquery replacement .. and ended up on a page that listed those methods as a way of finding elements .. that would be it
[16:23:04] <robertmaxrees> the jquery replacement is... native.
[16:23:08] <robertmaxrees> and an actual view layer.
[16:23:11] <momomo> i would consider it shit .. just right there .. because these guys obviously are not into developer productivity
[16:23:29] <robertmaxrees> "these guys"?
[16:23:51] <taplar> the imaginary guys who wrote the jquery replacement
[16:23:55] <momomo> i mean on a javascript framework library page
[16:24:00] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:24:01] <momomo> those guys that developed it
[16:25:07] <taplar> personally i'd want to do some timing tests on it to see if it had a performance gain over jQuery to make a decision.  judging just by name is pretty weak
[16:25:23] <taplar> but i'm not a true developer i guess
[16:25:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:26:38] <momomo> taplar: even then .. if there are performance benefits .. why couldn't they have better naming ? and that is just two methods .. how about the rest ? of which I have not yet discovered .. can I expect to havet to type 15 characters to perform an operation? likely ..
[16:26:51] <taplar> i dunno dude.  you can't please everyone
[16:26:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:27:03] <robertmaxrees> "developer productivity" is a funny thing.
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather invest the one-time fraction of a second to type a thing out and then save myself from headaches later because i can't glean what a method does from it's name.

[19:29:48] <spinningCat> hey
[19:30:05] <spinningCat> what is my mistake here https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/14/
[19:44:09] <duch_kazatel> spinningCat dunno - what's the bug?
[19:44:41] <spinningCat> hmm
[19:44:59] <robertmaxrees> kinda hard to help if I don't know what's broken ;0
[19:45:01] <robertmaxrees> * ;)
[19:45:16] <spinningCat> xD
[19:45:35] <robertmaxrees> sooo what's up?
[19:45:43] <spinningCat> i just try to clone $('.box'); into $('.boxes') with that 	$('.box').clone(true,true).appendTo('.boxes');
[19:46:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaand how do you know it's not working?
[19:46:29] <spinningCat> it cloned so many boxes https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/15/
[19:46:36] <spinningCat> check result
[19:46:36] <robertmaxrees> well that's easy.,
[19:46:41] <robertmaxrees> $('.box').clone(true, true).appendTo('.boxes');
[19:46:43] <spinningCat> it should clone 7 boxes
[19:46:50] <robertmaxrees> that's selecting every box that exists each time it runs.
[19:46:55] <spinningCat> have cloned
[19:47:01] <spinningCat> damn
[19:47:16] <spinningCat> ah
[19:47:18] <spinningCat> damn
[19:47:27] <robertmaxrees> easy fix.
[19:47:32] <spinningCat> last()
[19:47:34] <spinningCat> ?
[19:47:38] <robertmaxrees> even easier.
[19:47:45] <spinningCat> hmm
[19:47:45] <robertmaxrees> var $aBox = $('.box').clone(true, true); up at the top.
[19:47:49] <robertmaxrees> then use $aBox
[19:47:55] <spinningCat> off the top of my head
[19:48:35] <spinningCat> dont i need appendTo
[19:48:38] <spinningCat> hmm
[19:48:46] <spinningCat> sec
[19:48:49] <robertmaxrees> right...
[19:48:57] <robertmaxrees> but instead of $('.box') you use $aBox
[19:49:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rvgatgns/16/ another way.
[19:50:57] <robertmaxrees> spinningCat ^
[19:52:02] <spinningCat> thanks but i guess i am blind
[19:52:06] <spinningCat> i  cannot find aBox
[19:52:07] <spinningCat> ÇD

[19:53:00] <spinningCat> cool
[19:53:03] <spinningCat> i see thjat
[19:53:11] <robertmaxrees> then look down at 70
[19:53:14] <spinningCat> i am working in front of comp since 2.p.m.
[19:53:21] <spinningCat> it is 3 a.m.
[19:53:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:53:28] <robertmaxrees> go to bed duder.
[19:53:33] <robertmaxrees> not worth it.
[19:54:09] <spinningCat> i may have a job after that
[19:54:45] <robertmaxrees> heh.  you'll write worse code the longer you go.
[19:57:10] <spinningCat> almost finished
[19:57:25] <spinningCat> bad thing obj does not guarantee order
[19:57:59] <Grombel> Hi, could I please delay someone with the question about ajax responses?
[19:58:42] <spinningCat> delay
[19:58:52] <spinningCat> you want to delay ajax request?
[20:00:54] <robertmaxrees> Grombel just ask your question
[20:00:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:01:44] <Grombel> I am sending ajax to php script that insert record to mysql. After I get response with inserted data and I append them at the end of table. Second, I have html5 contentedit=true element, I can update record through it - function focusoff, but when I have new record appended without page refresh, I cant call this update function :(
[20:02:17] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us a fiddle with the event binding?
[20:02:51] <Grombel> ha, can I do gitlab commit?
[20:02:55] <_3by8> Hi, I'm running a filter on a jQuery object returned by DataTables. Inside of the filter, if I call $(this).context or $(this)[0], I get a table row with table cells inside that looks like plain HTML. Can I filter that further?
[20:03:05] <robertmaxrees> Grombel just need to see the specific code.
[20:03:25] <robertmaxrees> _3by8 whjat do you mean?
[20:03:58] <robertmaxrees> "filter that further"?
[20:04:09] <robertmaxrees> $(this) do you mean you want a child of that element?
[20:04:11] <_3by8> robertmaxrees: the console prints plain HTML. I want a cell in the row.
[20:04:17] <_3by8> robertmaxrees: yeah :)
[20:04:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('td')
[20:04:34] <robertmaxrees> that'll give you a jquery object of the tds
[20:04:39] <_3by8> robertmaxrees: thanks friend
[20:05:31] <robertmaxrees> Grombel but seriously, just paste the event binding.
[20:05:36] <robertmaxrees> with the related markup.
[20:05:42] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'm pretty sure I know what the issue it.
[20:07:21] <Grombel> https://gitlab.com/Rouha/test_ajax/commit/75db0f24b49b9c8851923b669f980bb2a489afc3
[20:07:35] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:07:40] <robertmaxrees> super hard to read, yo.
[20:08:02] <Grombel> :D ok
[20:08:04] <robertmaxrees> at least click the line # that's not working in your js and share that link.
[20:08:59] <robertmaxrees> ah
[20:09:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:09:12] <robertmaxrees> Grombel https://gitlab.com/Rouha/test_ajax/commit/75db0f24b49b9c8851923b669f980bb2a489afc3#bb6499b8e938f92a3695fff1afe57edea4b9efb7_151_195
[20:09:16] <robertmaxrees> this the broken part?
[20:09:26] <robertmaxrees> wat.  it's dead now.
[20:10:23] <Grombel> yeah, the link is dead
[20:10:47] <robertmaxrees> either way, you want a delegated handler for that focusout
[20:11:04] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> these will explain the issue.
[20:11:51] <Grombel> thanks man, problem is just with appended record, after refresh is update working
[20:11:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:12:08] <robertmaxrees> because you're binding to elements that don't yet exist.
[20:12:19] <robertmaxrees> the delegated handler will fix that.
[20:12:30] <Grombel> ok :) Thanks, have a nice day/night
[20:12:46] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[20:20:15] <spinningCat> this is really interesting
[20:20:31] <spinningCat> it skips one color i dont know why that is https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/19/
[20:21:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:21:41] <robertmaxrees> give me a line or something to start with buddy
