[06:15:09] <ilaraca>     return ('+'.repeat(int)+'\n').repeat(int).slice(0,-1);
[06:15:11] <ilaraca> }

[10:07:43] <bestdesign> howw can combine?
[10:08:06] <bestdesign> i have custom var with ids
[10:08:17] <bestdesign> and i want to set offset.top for every var
[10:09:48] <bestdesign> with ids?
[10:12:29] <bestdesign> how to add more ids in one div?
[10:12:32] <bestdesign> ro that ca nbe work?
[10:20:05] <bestdesign> with var test = $('#id');
[10:20:10] <bestdesign> only one ids possbiel select?
[10:22:59] <mrenigma> I'm so frustrated. I can't seem to figure out how to get .focusout to fire. Here's what I got: https://pastebin.com/etee3Uhy but when I enter the next form field nothing happens, or at least nothing that is supposed to. Ideas? Documentation? Anything?
[10:26:45] <Cork> mrenigma: you need to provide the dom structure you're working with
[10:27:05] <Cork> cause if you move from a parent to a child that won't trigger blur
[10:28:51] <mrenigma> Cork: It's on my localhost and it's the first field I'm leaving...but here it is: https://pastebin.com/aL5wyvW9
[10:40:11] <N1CH0L4S> I have blue oranges, how do i find which key (in this case fruit) https://jqplay.org/s/phwpiZrNyP
[10:40:32] <N1CH0L4S> (if that makes sense)
[10:52:22] <mrenigma> Cork: I've tried both .focusout() AND .blur() with no joy...and a correction...the alert IS firing but it's not getting any text.
[11:05:37] <N1CH0L4S> perhaps i'll start simple. how do i find which key potatoes is in? https://jqplay.org/s/VbbeM5Z0Ni
[12:18:19] <N1CH0L4S> https://jqplay.org/s/5R4KMDUIMM how do i search this json for "africa" and get "earth" with jq?
[12:26:15] <bestdesign> hi
[12:26:46] <bestdesign> how combine multiple var with custom ids one.offset().top - 100;
[12:26:50] <bestdesign> have nine?
[12:26:58] <robertmaxrees> fiddl;e
[12:27:01] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[12:27:06] <bestdesign> repeat nine times?
[12:27:15] <bestdesign> ok
[12:31:06] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/4ucLgpm5/
[12:31:11] <bestdesign> how make with less lines?
[12:31:13] <bestdesign> to not repat?
[12:52:34] <bestdesign> hi
[13:10:50] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees ^^
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> i've been gone for a while.
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> anything after you said "repeat nine times" i missed.
[13:11:34] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/4ucLgpm5/ I try to do this with less lines?
[13:11:43] <bestdesign> to not repeat that much
[13:11:51] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[13:12:02] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to do it that way?
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> can you provide more context?
[13:12:27] <bestdesign> I have a .on click button if not filled scroll top of element
[13:12:31] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[13:12:43] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i think i know what you're going for and we already solved this problem.
[13:13:00] <bestdesign> this not but wait show you
[13:13:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:16:39] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/b0L16e7v/
[13:16:49] <bestdesign> snippet and i want to every own ids to scroll top
[13:17:06] <robertmaxrees> markup?
[13:17:08] <bestdesign> but as i think there need to repeat many times...
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> gimme something to work with here.
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> and no, there isn't.
[13:17:27] <robertmaxrees> this is almost identical ito something i helped you with.
[13:18:20] <bestdesign> well is works fine just try to combine try var s with (#id)
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:18:36] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[13:20:05] <bestdesign> deltaone_reply = $('#input_deltaone_reply:input');var deltaone_szam = deltaone_who.offset().top - 100;scrollTop: deltaone_reply or deltaone_szam		var deltaone_szam = deltaone_who.offset().top - 100;
[13:20:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[13:20:17] <bestdesign> _reply is the id
[13:20:18] <robertmaxrees> give me a real example.
[13:51:18] <bestdesign> I see my logic and I think I do the badest way ever :P
[13:51:42] <robertmaxrees> it's not "the badest way ever" - you just need to slow down and think.

[15:14:41] <paule32> hello
[15:14:55] <paule32> have problem with: https://jsfiddle.net/ba2e735p/9/
[15:15:15] <paule32> i expected a yellow box with 4 corner-circles
[15:15:16] <robertmaxrees> draggable is not a function?
[15:15:29] <paule32> but something is wrong
[15:15:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:15:54] <robertmaxrees> or do you not need the draggable?
[15:17:48] <paule32> not at the moment, yet
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> then remove it?
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> it's causing errors.
[15:18:09] <paule32> i prefer to have 4 circles in the 4 corners
[15:18:14] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/ba2e735p/11/
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> soooo what part specifically here is broken?
[15:19:39] <paule32> on line 8, i construct a div
[15:19:59] <paule32> these div should be draggable later
[15:20:10] <paule32> it seems ok
[15:20:15] <robertmaxrees> pairing things down
[15:20:41] <robertmaxrees> is it that the resizers aren't showing?
[15:21:02] <paule32> i don't know
[15:21:15] <robertmaxrees> so what is making the circles??
[15:21:16] <paule32> no errors in the debuger
[15:21:32] <paule32> line 19
[15:21:52] <robertmaxrees> $('#resizable' + j).css({ ?
[15:22:26] <paule32> that the container
[15:22:41] <paule32> at line 43
[15:22:44] <robertmaxrees> so how are you trying to build the circles you want?
[15:22:45] <paule32> woops
[15:22:48] <paule32> line 42
[15:22:55] <paule32> they are defined
[15:22:57] <paule32> or styled
[15:23:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:23:20] <robertmaxrees> they're not though.
[15:23:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8cwuhejL/1/
[15:23:29] <robertmaxrees> see how that selector returns 0?
[15:42:57] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:51:26] <paule32> so
[15:51:29] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/ba2e735p/12/
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> js errors again.
[15:52:20] <paule32> now, i would like, that the yellow box can be sized by the 4 circles
[15:52:56] <paule32> when i use "var currentResizer" dont work

[17:03:43] <sean__> hi! i'm attempting to load jquery from within a github.io page, using `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>`, and getting `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` in chrome 71.0.3578.98. has anyone run into this before?
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> are you using an ad blocker?
[17:06:15] <sean__> i'm thrilled that my idiocy is so easily resolved. thank you!
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> haha, no it's all good :)
[17:06:32] <sean__> <3
[17:15:19] <taplar> what a drag
[17:15:25] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:20:32] <gambl0r3> hello?
[17:21:26] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions -> "You don't need to ask if anyone is available or wants to help. Just ask your question and they can get on with it."
[17:21:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:30:56] <paule32> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/ba2e735p/15/
[17:31:20] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:31:22] <robertmaxrees> so now what?
[17:31:43] <paule32> move is ok, but scale ...
[17:32:24] <robertmaxrees> "move is ok, but scale .." what?
[17:32:30] <robertmaxrees> more details pls :)
[17:33:18] <robertmaxrees> oh lol you just commented out the code that actually handles the draggable.
[17:33:28] <paule32> i would like use the circles in the borader of the yellow box, to size, and/or scale the yellow box
[17:33:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1f6k584e/2/ so not like this?
[17:33:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:34:45] <paule32> yeah
[17:34:48] <paule32> yes
[17:35:05] <paule32> but the circles don't work
[17:35:06] <robertmaxrees> so do you understand what your issue is?
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> your code is targeting '#resizable' + j
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> but that's the container, not the little circles.
[17:37:12] <robertmaxrees> and also: https://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/
[17:37:17] <robertmaxrees> this is really what you want.
