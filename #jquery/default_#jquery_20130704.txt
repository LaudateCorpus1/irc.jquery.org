[00:32:39] <rageous> If anyone is about, I'm curious if there is a glaring issue I've overlooked here..
[00:32:42] <rageous> http://jsfiddle.net/VXUwT/
[00:35:48] <Cork> rageous: why don't you just use serialize() ?
[00:36:28] <rageous> Cork: That's a good idea.
[00:36:31] <rageous> I'm new.
[00:36:39] <Cork> $('
[00:36:40] <rageous> But, I have seen some examples.
[00:36:41] <Cork> opps
[00:36:59] <Cork> data: $('#populateURL').serialzie(),
[00:37:06] <Cork> should do the same as what your doing
[00:37:09] <Cork> *you're
[00:37:30] <rageous> Cork: Does serialize just do json formatting?
[00:37:36] <Cork> no
[00:37:45] <Cork> aha
[00:37:54] <Cork> try serailizeArray() then
[00:39:00] <rageous> I'll give that a shot. Thanks very much, Cork.
[00:39:08] <Cork> np
[00:39:40] <Cork> rageous: i'm not garanteeing that it will give the structure you want
[00:40:09] <Cork> didn't notice that you use a none standard submit encoding
[00:40:22] <rageous> I understand, but right now, my backend is accepting well-formatted PUTs through cURL, but I can't seem to make it correctly formatted using .ajax
[00:40:44] <Cork> rageous: are you sure it expects json encoded data?
[00:40:51] <rageous> Absolutely.
[00:40:53] <Cork> and not the standard www-form encoding?
[00:42:00] <Cork> rageous: on second though i think you need to do something like
[00:42:21] <Cork> data: JSON.stringify({ key:value, key:value, key:value }),
[00:42:43] <Cork> cause else you will get the normal params encoding
[00:43:38] <rageous> Yeah -- something still isn't quite right here. Still bad requests with the PUT here.
[00:44:06] <Cork> so use JSON.strinfy
[00:44:07] <rageous> I'll try Stringify
[00:45:17] <Cork> uh, no JSON.stringify not Stringify
[00:47:21] <rageous> Well, I'm getting a different error, but I think my JSON is finally going through well-formed.
[00:47:31] <rageous> I think that does it. Thanks again, Cork.
[00:47:38] <Cork> well it wasn't json before :)
[00:47:55] <rageous> Oh? What was it at that point, then?
[00:47:58] <Cork> you send www-form-encoded but with application/json
[00:48:05] <rageous> Ah
[00:48:09] <Cork> as the content type
[00:48:54] <Cork> rageous: also remember that { key1: 'value', key2: 'value2' } isn't json
[00:49:18] <Cork> '{"key1":"value","key2":"value2"}' is
[00:49:34] <Cork> json is a string, not a javascript object
[00:50:13] <rageous> That's a distinction that I wasn't aware of before.
[00:50:38] <Cork> thats why you need to use JSON.stringfy
[01:06:03] <gavrochel> hello
[01:07:41] <gavrochel> I have a function inside Jquery. Somewhere in html I want to call that function like this http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/zaN3z/2/
[01:08:22] <Cork> gavrochel: just make sure the function is accessable globally
[01:08:39] <Cork> currently you have it in a callback scope for domready
[01:20:33] <gavrochel> Cork I need that function to be inside Jquery
[01:20:54] <Cork> what do you mean by "inside" ?
[01:22:00] <gavrochel> here is the whole function http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/zaN3z/3/
[01:23:17] <gavrochel> the functions uses Jquery statements
[01:23:47] <gavrochel> but i want it to be globally accesible
[01:24:02] <Cork> so just make it a globa function
[01:24:09] <gavrochel> how?
[01:24:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/zaN3z/4/
[01:24:54] <Cork> by not creating it in a scope where it isn't globally accessable
[01:25:24] <gavrochel> you lost me :-(
[01:25:40] <Cork> do you know what a scope is in javascript?
[01:26:45] <gavrochel> I know in other languages
[01:26:58] <gavrochel> I assume is the same in jscript
[01:27:27] <Cork> jscript is microsoft, ecmascript or javascript (depending on how strict you want to be) is the standard
[01:27:42] <Cork> anyway a scope is created for each function
[01:27:58] <Cork> and if you create a function in a function it inherits the scope from the parent function
[01:28:12] <gavrochel> so all my functions are inside a jQuery(function($){}
[01:28:13] <Cork> a scope creates a separate namespace
[01:28:32] <Cork> ya, and that means they can only be accessed inside that function
[01:28:39] <Cork> if you want them globally; create them globally
[01:28:57] <gavrochel> here is where I need help
[01:29:12] <gavrochel> how to use Jquery sintax outside a jQuery(function($){
[01:29:15] <Cork> sigh
[01:32:09] <Cork> gavrochel: http://jsfiddle.net/zaN3z/6/
[01:33:03] <Cork> gavrochel: jquery isn't a language or a syntax, it is just a framework to help you write javascript easier
[01:33:31] <libin_> hello, I have got contact us page, where i fill in the details and when i hit the submit the values get send to the server using ajax, and an email is sent to the corresponding email. Till here it works all good.. but after the email is send i want to remove the contact form and replace it with a "thank you" message using ajax
[01:34:25] <Cork> libin_: just have the "thank you" in the page but hidden
[01:34:40] <Cork> and then do .hide() on the form, and .show() on the message
[01:34:43] <libin_> i have done that bit in the success event of ajax call.. but it looks like the page is getting refreshed and hence the contact form is poping back on.. how can i stop this
[01:35:04] <Cork> are you doing event.preventDefault() in the submit event?
[01:35:33] <libin_> i read about it, but was confused where to add it?
[01:35:49] <libin_> is it in the success event or where i call the submit function?
[01:35:57] <Cork> your using $('form).submit(function() {}) to start the ajax call right?
[01:36:19] <Cork> * $('form').submit(function() {})
[01:36:46] <libin_> this is how i call the function <input class="vc-button" data-disable-with="Send it thru" onclick='ajaxFunction()' name="commit" type="submit" value="Send it thru">
[01:37:02] <Cork> ok, don't do that
[01:37:13] <Cork> bind an event listener on the form, not a click action on the button
[01:37:33] <Cork> and don't do it inline
[01:37:43] <lenswipee> what's the difference?
[01:37:52] <Cork> lenswipee: inline or click?
[01:37:54] <lenswipee> click action on submit button
[01:38:07] <Cork> it only fires by an actual click on the button
[01:38:27] <Cork> instead of listening for a submit event fired when the browser tries to submit the form
[01:38:56] <libin_> ok will try that now
[01:38:59] <libin_> thanks
[01:39:23] <Cork> libin_: and in the submit handler take the first argument (event) and then do event.preventDefault() the first thing you do in the function
[01:39:25] <Cork> and you should be set
[01:40:05] <KucukMubasir> hi, my $.ajax get query adds a query string such that ?_=43543545 , why is this?
[01:40:07] <Cork> i love that csp makes inline event listeners impossible to use ^^
[01:40:33] <Cork> KucukMubasir: its a cache workaround
[01:40:50] <Farid> Hi there
[01:41:00] <Cork> KucukMubasir: if it doesn't do that, and you request an url that you have loaded before, the browser will just load it from the local cache
[01:41:01] <KucukMubasir> cork, this one? "Disables caching by appending a query string parameter, "_=[TIMESTAMP]", to the URL unless the cache option is set to true"
[01:41:03] <Cork> and not contact the server
[01:41:12] <Cork> KucukMubasir: yes
[01:41:33] <KucukMubasir> thanks Cork
[01:42:08] <Farid> I am useing jQuery UI DataTables. I want to use autocomplete in the texboxes that i am using for filtration
[01:43:07] <Farid> is it even possible
[01:46:10] <KucukMubasir> Cork, can't I get fresh server response without that timestamp ?
[01:46:35] <Cork> KucukMubasir: not reliably no
[01:46:54] <Cork> KucukMubasir: the server might send a nostore cache option
[01:47:03] <Cork> but that needs to be configured server side
[01:47:14] <Cork> (and then it isn't controllable from script at all)
[01:47:21] <Farid> any DataTables expert here.
[01:47:50] <gavrochel> Cork I think I got it. Running all my code inside a jQuery(function($){} only assures me that the code is executed on domready event. Also the inside code is not available outside.
[01:48:06] <Cork> Farid: just as the question; if no one answers it normally means that noone that's here right now knows the answer
[01:48:27] <Cork> Farid: so wait a while (way 30mins to 1h) and ask again
[01:48:34] <Cork> way==say
[01:48:48] <Cork> gavrochel: yes
[01:48:55] <gavrochel> I thought different till now. Thank you!
[01:48:56] <Farid> Thanks... I'll be back.
[01:57:08] <rabbi1> hi, how can i get the values of an object without knowing the key ?
[01:57:48] <Cork> rabbi1: more context
[01:59:03] <libin_> Cork : Thanks its working now. :)
[01:59:14] <rabbi1>  I have any objects, with key and values , i need to type the value without knowing it's key name, because the objects are dynamic, could be 1 or more
[01:59:22] <rabbi1> Cork: ^
[02:00:08] <Cork> without more info the best i can give is something like $.each(obj, function(key, val) {})
[02:00:24] <Cork> like i said i need context to give an exact answer
[02:00:50] <Cork> as in what are you trying to do, in what format do you need to access the values and so on
[02:01:26] <ph88> if i do a fadeOut on a div with a bunch of children will those children also fade out ?
[02:01:47] <rabbi1> i am trying this $.each(data, function(index, item){console.log(item.keyname);});
[02:01:50] <Cork> ph88: fadeOut set opacity on the parent
[02:02:10] <Cork> ph88: and yes opacity affects the children of the element it's set on
[02:03:25] <ph88> i have this in  my backbone view :  this.$el.fadeOut();    and in the watch window (firebug) i see this.$el = 	jQuery(div#part_type_189.part_type)    when i mouse over this value the box lights up in the dom .. however when Continue running the code, the fadeout effect doesn't happen
[02:03:52] <rabbi1> data = [{"code":"MED18","date":"2013:04:01"},{"code":"MED19","date":"2013:04:01,2013:04:01"},{"code":"MED19","date":"2013:04:01,2013:04:01"}];
[02:03:56] <rabbi1> Cork ^
[02:04:11] <Cork> rabbi1: that is the data, not the context
[02:04:14] <bluesm> It is efficient to get the jquery 2 from the google server ?
[02:04:24] <rabbi1> but i don want to use keyname e.g. item.code, or item.date etc.....
[02:04:27] <bluesm> Assuming that most sites do that, and browser could have cache of it ?
[02:04:29] <Cork> rabbi1: the context is the code
[02:04:58] <Cork> rabbi1: as in "in what context are you trying to access the value without the key name"
[02:05:03] <k_sze[work]> What's the proper way to check if an element is effectively {display: none}, possibly after it is hidden using $(elem).hide() or $(elem).fadeOut()?
[02:05:22] <Cork> `api :visible
[02:05:22] <b-ot> Cork: :visible Selector: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[02:05:24] <systemfault> If you need to check that, you have a problem :P
[02:05:33] <Cork> `api .is
[02:05:34] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[02:05:38] <Cork> `apiis
[02:05:40] <Cork> `api is
[02:05:40] <b-ot> Cork: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[02:05:54] <xhoy> i have a <ul class="x yz"><li class="a bc"> can i do $("ul[class=x], li[class=bc]") or something?
[02:06:08] <rabbi1> Cork: http://pastebin.com/thLPpqDb
[02:06:20] <Cork> k_sze[work]: but ya, personally i normally try to set a class for that instead
[02:06:20] <systemfault> xhoy: What about… using the . ?
[02:06:26] <ph88> i have this html element   <div id="part_type_180" class="part_type">  a form inside </div>    when i do in my console $('.part_type').fadeOut();   ... nothing happens ... why is this ??
[02:06:31] <xhoy> it must be a ul
[02:06:38] <systemfault> ul.x :/
[02:06:43] <xhoy> oke
[02:06:43] <systemfault> That's basic css..
[02:06:48] <systemfault> You should learn it.
[02:06:59] <xhoy> true that
[02:07:09] <xhoy> but can i stack them with a , ??
[02:07:09] <Cork> rabbi1: that still isn't enough context... >_<
[02:07:42] <rabbi1> I need to display the 'value' of each element  that's it
[02:07:54] <Cork> rabbi1: fine $.each(data, function(index, item){ $.each(item, function(k, value) { console.log(value); })});
[02:08:05] <bluesm> I mean reffering to http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.2/jquery.min.js
[02:08:09] <rabbi1> like "MED18 , 2013-3-1" etc ….
[02:08:13] <bluesm> *referring
[02:08:16] <Cork> not sure if that will solve your problem as i don't know what you're trying to do but...
[02:08:32] <rageous> Where are you from Cork?
[02:08:42] <Cork> rageous: sweden
[02:08:45] <ph88> HTML: <div id="part_type_180" class="part_type">a form inside</div>      Does work:   $('.part_type').hide();   Does not work:  $('.part_type').fadeOut();    ... confused o_O
[02:09:10] <rageous> Very cool. I ask only because I was want to try to catch you again tomorrow.
[02:09:19] <Cork> ph88: might have conflict with your css
[02:09:21] <rageous> If I should have any brain busters for you.
[02:09:30] <Cork> heh
[02:09:41] <rageous> Thanks very much for your help. I hope to see you tomorrow.
[02:09:43] <rageous> Good night.
[02:10:53] <ph88> Cork: what kind of conflict could that be?  I didn't set any css directly on this class or id ... everything in inherit ... i will get the computated css style now
[02:11:12] <rabbi1> Cork: thanks $.each(item, function(k, value) { console.log(k, value); })} was enough ;)  i just need to push those to an array now…. take care
[02:11:31] <Cork> rabbi1: and that was the context i asked for...
[02:11:57] <rabbi1> i had said, already, to get the value from the object ;)
[02:12:13] <Cork> well there is many ways to get the value
[02:12:21] <Cork> that you wanted it in an array was the context
[02:12:23] <Cork> sigh
[02:13:05] <Cork> (and as a result you get code that isn't optimal)
[02:15:02] <ph88> Cork:  i have this computed style on that div that won't fadeOut  http://pastebin.com/tUQ4pRPv
[02:15:31] <Cork> ah, flex
[02:15:41] <Cork> that might mess things up
[02:16:31] <Cork> ph88: but what i meant is, run the fadeOut command and inspect what happens in the style attribute on the element
[02:16:42] <Cork> that is normally a good start
[02:17:06] <ph88> Cork: i'm not sure how i can do the inspection ... by computed style ?
[02:17:28] <ph88> actually it does work in opera ... but not in firefox
[02:17:30] <ph88> o_O
[02:17:32] <Cork> ph88: most dom inspectors show the updates live
[02:17:53] <Cork> the built in in firefox, firebug, chrome i know does it
[02:17:58] <ph88> hhmm when i remove all the breakpoints now it works in firefox too ...
[02:18:06] <Cork> heh
[02:18:13] <ph88> *wtf moment*
[02:18:23] <Cork> ph88: animations in jquery is timer based
[02:18:36] <Cork> so if you breakpoint it the timer steps will not trigger
[02:18:39] <ph88> so i should put a breakpoint on those lines ?
[02:19:03] <Cork> it's built to skip a step if the time has passed
[02:19:12] <Cork> so basically don't breakpoint animations
[02:19:17] <Cork> cause it won't work
[02:19:25] <ph88> ok good advice, thx
[02:19:42] <ph88> i thought the breakpoint on the line itself would just not start the timer yet
[02:19:57] <ph88> and then when continue it would start the timer and do the animation and then move to the next breakpoint
[02:20:04] <Cork> that is true, as long as it is sync code
[02:20:32] <ph88> well for some reason, i guess, it wasnt sync code then ^^
[02:20:34] <Cork> if it is a continuation from another animation it isn't true though
[02:20:47] <ph88> this is the particular line:   this.$el.fadeIn();
[02:21:05] <Cork> and did you do fadeOut or something similar just before?
[02:21:33] <ph88> i did this the line before $('#backbone').append(this.$el).animate({height: 'auto'});
[02:21:40] <Cork> cause the breakpoint at the line or at the line isn't the problem
[02:21:50] <Cork> it is the one directly after that will break animations
[02:21:57] <ph88> eh no wrong line ... sorry i copied the wrong part here
[02:22:00] <Cork> as breakpoints will stop the js executions
[02:22:09] <Cork> so no animation will trigger
[02:22:11] <ph88> i didnt do anything on this.$el in the 2 lines before that
[02:22:21] <Cork> (in contrast to css3 animations)
[02:22:57] <ph88> you think i should use jQuery animate to go to height: auto ... or better to use css3 ?
[02:23:31] <ph88> better css3 i think, i will try that
[02:28:12] <bluesm> What are properties i could animate with regular jquery ?
[02:30:04] <Cork> bluesm: all properties that isn't compound values
[02:30:26] <Cork> with exception where external resources is used
[02:30:41] <Cork> like images
[02:32:05] <bluesm>  Cork: Not - compound value is simple "number" value ?
[02:32:22] <bluesm>  Cork: What about units ?
[02:32:54] <Cork> bluesm: ya, that is mostly true
[02:33:07] <intellix> I'm trying to QUnit test a jQuery widget using grunt-contrib-qunit which uses PhantomJS… is it possible to test say… browser resizing?
[02:33:21] <Cork> bluesm: i think you can animate from top middle bottom though
[02:33:32] <Cork> and things like that
[02:42:49] <ph88> Why does this delay not wait 2 seconds ?  http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/   ... this works when you remove the 3rd javascript line
[02:45:21] <bluesm> Cork: Color should be just integer, this would be soo easier. But probably nobody thinks about JS when created css ....
[02:46:45] <Cork> bluesm: well integers would actually make it harder
[02:47:02] <mrHAT> ph88 the second line allready makes that element invisible by setting the opacity to 0
[02:47:06] <mrHAT> and you do it instantly
[02:47:12] <Cork> bluesm: but there is parsers for rgba, and the likes
[02:47:30] <Cork> bluesm: i think jquery-ui contains the parsers for colors
[02:47:31] <ph88> mrHAT: yes but the keeps up taking space in the DOM ... that's why display: none  (AKA jQuery.hide() ) is needed
[02:47:59] <mrHAT> $('#test').hide();
[02:48:29] <ph88> mrHAT: yes but this will do the hide immediately so it doesn't show the transition anymore ...
[02:48:53] <mrHAT> what are you trying to do
[02:48:56] <ph88> 0s ->  opacity from 1 to 0 -> 2s -> display:none (hide)
[02:49:13] <Cork> ph88: hide isn't an animated command
[02:49:26] <mrHAT> you can use fadeout
[02:49:27] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/1/
[02:49:36] <ph88> Cork: yes i know ... i want it to be executed after the css fadeout is completed
[02:49:57] <mrHAT> than do a callback on fadeout
[02:50:01] <Cork> ph88: then you need to use the events or callbacks
[02:50:16] <ph88> it works with hide(1)  ...
[02:50:26] <Cork> events if you use transition, or callback if you use fadeOut
[02:50:38] <Cork> ph88: yes cause that makes the hide a quick animation
[02:50:40] <Cork> 1 ms
[02:50:52] <Cork> so it waits for the .delay() you added
[02:50:56] <Cork> but it is still a hack
[02:51:16] <ph88> how do i make an event on the css transition complete ?
[02:51:27] <mrHAT> ph88, so you want to show the element with a small fadein effect, wait 2 seconds, and fadeout ?
[02:51:41] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/2/
[02:51:46] <Cork> that is the correct solution
[02:52:06] <Cork> opps should have removed the zero http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/3/
[02:52:10] <ph88> no the element should be visible immediately on page load ... then transition to opacity 0 with css ... then after 2 seconds do display:none immediately
[02:52:31] <Cork> ph88: check the /3/
[02:52:48] <ph88> Cork:  yes that's it thanks ... i don't know why you put height() on line 2 ... it works without this line as well
[02:53:02] <Cork> ph88: it isn't needed for this example
[02:53:18] <Cork> but it is needed if you want to animate something you just added
[02:53:40] <ph88> ah instead of using a little timeOut ...
[02:53:52] <ph88> to have a little bit of delay so the css doesn't get confused
[02:53:56] <ph88> ok i get it
[02:54:03] <ph88> using height() for this is smart
[02:54:25] <ph88> i used a 1 ms timeOut for this before ^^
[02:54:28] <Cork> ph88: you need to trigger reflow for the browser to get the initial value
[02:54:47] <Leo___> hay guys
[02:54:48] <Cork> timeouts is not grate for that, as it causes lag
[02:55:02] <ph88> Cork:  hmm ok
[02:55:31] <ph88> i was guessing that your solution is fixing the same problem as described here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions   "Care should also be taken when using a transition immediately after adding the element to the DOM using .appendChild() or removing its display: none; property. This is seen as if the initial state had never occured and the element was always in its final state. The easy way to over
[02:55:49] <Cork> ph88: yes
[02:55:52] <Leo___> need a hand, i have a form field and i would like it to count down the number of characters, so the users can see exactly how have letters they have left to type?
[02:55:59] <ph88> Cork: thx very much again
[02:56:15] <Cork> ph88: also you might want to have a look at visibility: collapse;
[02:56:29] <Cork> ph88: if you use that you wouldn't need the event or .hide()
[02:56:36] <Leo___> http://pastie.org/8109431
[02:57:03] <Leo___> im getting an error with this code on like 11
[02:57:42] <ph88> Cork:  you lost me here ... are you saying i can css transition from visibilty: visible to visibility: collapse ?
[02:57:45] <Cork> Leo___: whats the error?
[02:58:09] <Cork> ph88: yes
[02:58:22] <ph88> Cork: wow never knew about this ... nice one :)
[02:58:26] <Cork> ph88: you can delay visibility, and give it the transition time needed for the fade
[02:58:33] <Cork> and then it will collaps
[02:58:35] <Leo___> input.val() undefined on line 11
[02:58:35] <Cork> no js needed
[02:58:50] <Cork> 11?
[02:59:05] <Cork> you mean line 4 ?
[02:59:31] <Cork> also carefull remaining is a global variable
[02:59:36] <Cork> you need to declare it
[02:59:39] <ph88> Cork:  do you mean like this ?  http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/5/
[03:01:46] <Leo___> says 11 on here
[03:03:08] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/6/
[03:04:28] <Cork> Leo___: line 11 is a blank line in the pb
[03:04:33] <Cork> so it can't be that line
[03:05:01] <Leo___> ok can you see the problem though
[03:05:27] <Cork> i suspect that $ isn't jquery
[03:05:42] <libin> i have a mobile website,in which i need only contents to get scrol,while background  fixed,i used background-size:cover; it is not working in some mobile browsers.how can i make it working/
[03:06:42] <ph88> cork i take nr 6 :)
[03:06:54] <Cork> :)
[03:07:10] <Cork> ph88: i always try to keep as much css as possible in the css file
[03:07:18] <Cork> (and as little as possible in the js file)
[03:07:35] <Cork> makes life so much simpler when maintaining the site
[03:07:40] <ph88> yes i didn't knew about transition-delay ... this brings powerful posibilities
[03:08:28] <ph88> i can see why you don't want to transition on the visibility property over 2 seconds .. because it's not linear ... but i couldn't do it another way (before knowing transition-delay)
[03:08:47] <Cork> ah, you can make it linear
[03:09:02] <Cork> i just forgot to add that :)
[03:09:38] <ph88> how does that make sense ?  visibility only takes visible, hidden, collapse ... it's not even a numeric value ....
[03:09:41] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/7/
[03:09:43] <ph88> + inherit
[03:10:09] <Cork> ph88: well display:none could be transitioned too
[03:10:18] <Cork> if the spec had how it would work
[03:10:24] <Cork> or height: auto for that matter
[03:11:18] <Cork> ph88: and if you check, all i do with visibility is delay it
[03:11:24] <Cork> it isn't really animated
[03:12:12] <ph88> i don't understand how visibility can be animateble over time when not having a numeric value ...
[03:12:24] <Cork> like i said, it isn't
[03:12:32] <Cork> it's only delayed
[03:12:40] <ph88> yes i know i think it's very smart to do it this way
[03:12:54] <ph88> like i just said i didn't know about transition-delay ... so it's a very good solution
[03:13:04] <libin> i have a mobile website,in which i need only contents to get scroll,while background  fixed,i used background-size:cover; it is not working in some mobile browsers.how can i make it working?pls refer http://applicate.co.nz/applicateweb/index.html#howwework
[03:13:20] <Cork> ph88: well the credits goes to the ui theme for firefox :)
[03:13:25] <Cork> i stole the basic idea from there
[03:13:43] <Cork> (the find bar has similar transition hack)
[03:13:52] <ph88> i was just considering the possibility of putting a 2s animation on visiblity ... according to this list https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties visibility is actually animatible ... i just don't understand why ... but ok i already have my solution anyway  (with the transition-delay)
[03:14:30] <Cork> ph88: yes, it animates, but it doesn't do anything so...
[03:14:58] <ph88> maybe visiblity: visible  and visible: hidden maps to some numerical values in browser internals and thus is animateble ...
[03:15:06] <ph88> hhmm ok
[03:15:09] <ph88> well thx !
[03:15:17] <Cork> ph88: also don't forget to have prefixed values for webkit (possibly ms)
[03:15:30] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/7/   <--- this putting linear on visiblity doesn't matter
[03:15:33] <Cork> as webkit still doens't support the unprefiexed property
[03:15:48] <Cork> ph88: it does here
[03:16:21] <ph88> with duration of 0s the effect it instant for visiblity ... how can the transition curve matter ?
[03:16:22] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/8/
[03:16:30] <Cork> ah
[03:16:51] <Cork> ph88: ya, like i said visibility does animate, but it only snaps to the end of the animation
[03:17:03] <ph88> ye ok .. we are on the same page then :P
[03:17:07] <GlenK> hi.  why would this be so slow, and what should I be doing instead?  http://fpaste.org/22950/
[03:17:15] <ph88> great Cork
[03:17:16] <Cork> but the reason for that structure is that animate in works too
[03:17:41] <ph88> transition: visibility 0s, opacity 6s linear;   you don't think this is a valid structure ?
[03:17:57] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/9/
[03:18:11] <Cork> ph88: it is
[03:18:40] <Cork> ph88: but for animate out transition: 2s linear; would work
[03:18:47] <Cork> but if you remove the class it would break
[03:18:51] <Cork> (no animation)
[03:18:59] <Cork> that is when you need the delay part
[03:19:16] <ph88> yes i understand
[03:19:53] <ph88> i'm gonna go now put this stuff in my app
[03:26:36] <ph88> Cork:  ... actually it's not collapsing .... change the HTML to    <div>Start<div id="test">Lorem Ipsum</div>End</div>    on any of the versions
[03:26:50] <ph88> still keeps space in the layout
[03:27:45] <Cork> damn i forgot height
[03:29:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/10/
[03:29:32] <KucukMubasir> can I remove X-REQUESTED-WITH header sent with ajax ?
[03:29:43] <Cork> KucukMubasir: yes
[03:30:09] <Cork> you would have to manually remove the header from the xhr but it can be done
[03:30:29] <KucukMubasir> Cork with AjaxRequestObject.setRequestHeader() ?
[03:30:29] <Cork> ph88: warning though you can't animate the height with css
[03:30:36] <Cork> KucukMubasir: yes
[03:31:52] <ph88> Cork:  it works without visilbity too ... why would i even need visiblity then ?  http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/11/
[03:32:36] <Cork> ph88: if you want max-height; you don't
[03:32:54] <Cork> ph88: don't forget margins and borders if you don't set visibility thoguh
[03:33:02] <Cork> (margins you need to take care of anyway)
[03:33:30] <ph88> ah so visibility also takes care of borders, margins and maybe width ?
[03:33:47] <Cork> it takes care of border
[03:33:49] <Cork> but not margin
[03:33:56] <Cork> the element is invisible
[03:34:13] <lenswipee> Cork: You are a machine!
[03:34:18] <Cork> hmm
[03:34:56] <Cork> lenswipee: ?
[03:35:37] <Cork> ph88: bah, i just realized that collapse isn't really useful for the web...
[03:35:49] <lenswipee> Cork: It's a compliment. Whenever I check #jquery you are there helping someone.
[03:35:57] <Cork> it only works on talbes rows, for all other elements its just plain hidden :/
[03:36:08] <ph88> Cork:  yes look at this ... http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/12/  .... it's not nearly the same effect as display: none; needs to achieve ...
[03:37:48] <ph88> Cork:  this is the best solution (for my use case anyway)  http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/13/   (it's from version /4/)
[03:39:18] <KucukMubasir> Cork that didn't remove it . I made this myRequest.setRequestHeader("X-REQUESTED-WITH",""); before calling .done()
[03:39:18] <ph88> maybe i can put some of that still in css files though ...
[03:39:50] <Cork> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/nq276/14/ ? :D
[03:40:10] <Cork> KucukMubasir: you can't do it after the ajax call
[03:40:25] <Cork> you need to do it in the beforeSend event handler (i think that is the correct name)
[03:40:31] <Cork> *callback
[03:41:12] <KucukMubasir> oh ok
[03:41:25] <KucukMubasir> then I will set it with this.setRequestHeader ?
[03:41:45] <Cork> ?g jqeury set ajax xhr header
[03:41:46] <b-ot> Cork: Jquery, No X-Requested-With=XMLHttpRequest in ajax request ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885847/jquery-no-x-requested-with-xmlhttprequest-in-ajax-request-header
[03:41:54] <Cork> heh
[03:43:10] <ph88> Cork:  nice try, doesn't work :P
[03:43:23] <Cork> works for me
[03:43:37] <Cork> doesn't animate the height or width though (as i said, can't be done with css)
[03:43:39] <ph88> maybe browser related then
[03:44:00] <Cork> ph88: as far as i know only firefox supports the unprefixed transitions so ya
[03:44:06] <ph88> ye works in firefox , not in Iron (fork of Chrome)
[03:44:17] <Cork> ya, you need -webkit- there
[03:44:26] <ph88> ah right
[03:44:49] <ph88> well it's nice but i feel like this will overcomplicate the code
[03:45:07] <Cork> depends what part you mean by code :)
[03:45:20] <ph88> all you can see on the jsfiddle :P
[03:45:23] <Cork> css3 simplifies the js quite a bit when you do it right
[03:45:34] <Cork> ph88: the last few examples has one line of code
[03:45:40] <Cork> can't be much simpler then that
[03:45:44] <ph88> yes but the css3 explodes ...
[03:45:52] <Cork> css isn't code though :)
[03:46:02] <ph88> code + css then
[03:47:58] <celoplo> hi i'm new here
[03:48:09] <ph88> Welcome !
[03:48:17] <celoplo> thx
[03:48:29] <celoplo> what can i do here?
[03:49:17] <sysdef> you can ask questions about jQuery and hope to get a useful answer
[03:49:18] <ph88> ask advice or give advice i guess :D
[03:49:49] <celoplo> yes , i just today started in learning jquery
[03:49:58] <celoplo> i like js
[03:50:14] <celoplo> and i think learning jquerry would be useful
[03:50:56] <Cork> ?g learn.jquery.com
[03:50:56] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/
[03:51:06] <celoplo> is there any pdf/ebook i can download for free, to start my learning with it?
[03:51:34] <celoplo> i came to this chat from http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/additional-support/
[03:52:44] <ph88> one thing that i found to be very helpful with learning is to have something that you are eager to make .... instead of just reading through a book and making examples
[03:53:07] <celoplo> do you know user.js
[03:53:12] <celoplo> that what i like
[03:53:38] <celoplo> and i hope to create some good user.js using jquery
[03:54:10] <celoplo> if you dont know user.js then go to : http://userscripts.org/
[04:00:41] <KucukMubasir> cork, it won't remove the header; that way you can add another string to that header but can't remove X-REQUESTED-WITH
[04:05:50] <Cork> hmm
[04:06:05] <Cork> KucukMubasir: if that can't do it i don't think you can
[04:07:20] <_rgn> celoplo: you can use jquery with userscripts, yes.
[04:07:56] <Cork> KucukMubasir: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3372962/can-i-remove-the-x-requested-with-header-from-ajax-requests
[04:08:11] <Cork> _rgn: ya, you just need to load jquery as a dependency lib
[04:08:25] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/Nskw5/1/  unable to solve this, stuck in too many loops, i need to achieve the result as shown in "result" from  'data'
[04:08:52] <grafi> or use the jquery from the site you are userscripting on
[04:09:08] <rabbi1> Cork: too many uses of all the $each resulted in nothing at last :(
[04:09:09] <_rgn> Cork: or inject your code onto the page and use the site's jquery, i do that sometimes if i want to use javascript functions dfined on the page
[04:10:07] <Cork> rabbi1: what is d1 and d2 meant to be?
[04:11:02] <systemfault> diablo 1 and 2
[04:11:13] <celoplo> ok what is the best way to start learning jquery
[04:11:43] <systemfault> Learn the DOM before
[04:11:59] <systemfault> http://domenlightenment.com/
[04:12:10] <rabbi1> date1 date2 …… may be more in the actual object Cork
[04:12:10] <rabbi1> d1, d2, may not be required, just for sake of understanding i have put in there
[04:13:18] <progzer> Is there a way to detect availability of hardware acceleration on a mobile device?
[04:13:23] <GlenK> bit of a jQuery newb here.  I'm just kinda experimenting with stuff I learned on code academy.  I've got a div that's 50x50 pixels.  I'm trying to make it bigger on mouse over but it takes forever.  Any advice?  http://fpaste.org/22950/
[04:13:41] <progzer> I'm using jQm and noticed if I use a page transition on a low end device, I see "flickering" (instead of the slide transition).
[04:13:50] <rabbi1> Cork: lost in loops and splits :(
[04:14:00] <progzer> If I run the same on a higher end device, the slide transition seems to work fine.
[04:17:02] <grafi> 2 loops 2 splits rabbi1 no?
[04:17:07] <Cork> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/Nskw5/2/
[04:17:21] <rabbi1> grafi: yeap
[04:18:05] <grafi> hm that just proves i need to use map more Cork
[04:18:06] <grafi> :P
[04:18:13] <Cork> :)
[04:18:20] <Cork> and it is actually 2 maps and one loop
[04:18:31] <Cork> (and as map actually is a loop it is 3 loops()
[04:18:34] <Cork> *)
[04:18:54] <Cork> rabbi1: i skipped the dx keys
[04:18:58] <Cork> didn't see a point of them
[04:19:48] <GlenK> nevermind.  not that anyone was.  I figured out I can just pass two things to animate.
[04:19:53] <rabbi1> Cork: result2 is what i had types right ?
[04:20:01] <Cork> yes
[04:20:36] <rabbi1> ok, yeah… dx may not be required ….. np
[04:21:08] <rabbi1> let me just implement it here … thanks a lot …. i should remember all the jquery functions….
[04:30:30] <rabbi1> Cork: great, working good. Is there way to get rid of key == 'dates' ?  i can say indexOf(:) because only dates will have ':'  or any other way so that i can avoid the hard coding of that ?
[04:31:02] <Cork> well you will still have to depend on what it is
[04:31:20] <Cork> and i think depending on the key is better then sniffing the value
[04:32:13] <rabbi1> yeah, but what if the key is changed …  hmmm not sure now… any way will stick with key for now
[04:44:13] <GlenK> odd.  I guess this stuff doesn't happen sequentially?  Like my div is animated, but before it even does it's thing the fadeOut function I'm calling starts to happen.
[04:46:09] <Erma> In my jquerry mobile website i need fixed background in which contents scroll,i used  background-size : cover;i get this in some browsers but not in some mobile browsers,how can i make this possible?please reffer http://applicate.co.nz/applicateweb/index.html#howwework

[04:48:59] <ldexterldesign> hey, anyone got a jquery tabs plugin they'd recommend?*
[04:49:47] <ldexterldesign> ... been using http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs recently. just wondered if there's anything more technically advanced, as i'm hoping to learn something from the code?
[04:54:14] <grafi> its tabs, how much more technically advanced could they be?
[04:56:19] <ldexterldesign> grafi:well, until recently twitter was the only tabs plugin using data attributes
[04:56:57] <ldexterldesign> grafi:so it was/is more technically advanced than the others imo
[04:57:05] <ldexterldesign> grafi:clear?
[04:57:17] <grafi> sure

[05:18:11] <_rgn> how about logging it and seeing for yourself?
[05:23:05] <hemangpatel> Hi
[05:23:21] <hemangpatel> I'm preventing multiple enter key in comments
[05:23:49] <hemangpatel> i attach keypress with on
[05:24:20] <KucukMubasir> Cork thanks. By the way, the server I am trying to get over its X-REQUESTED-WITH just checks the value of that header. so, I prepend an empty string to XMLHttpRequest and I pass the server's check! :)
[05:24:20] <hemangpatel> when enter key press i'm doing JQObj(this).off( event );
[05:24:44] <hemangpatel> then on success JQObj(this).on( event );
[05:24:57] <hemangpatel> but second time it's not working
[05:28:26] <miCSu> was just thinking of creating active anchor link navbar that hovers the correct link depending on where you scroll
[05:31:39] <Auctus> so it seems like android recognizes both $(document).on('click') as well as $(element).bind('touchstart'), whereas iOS only recognizes touchstart... is that true? I think that's why I'm getting a double click on android and a single click on iOS
[05:32:51] <Brutick> Auctus: it might also be browser dependent on Android...
[05:33:13] <Cork> Auctus: no, i'm quite sure the stock browser in both android and ios supports click
[05:33:25] <Cork> (and same for touchstart)
[05:36:07] <Auctus> Ah. I realize that my iOS device is recognizing some click events and not others... must be something I'm doing then. Nevermind. Back to tinkering. :p
[05:54:40] <james_woods> Hi there, I upgraded from approx. jQuery 1.4 to 1.8. Now something "strange" is happening. My dropdowns are reacting on any change not just if there are closed. is there another way of adressing elements more explicitly?
[05:54:55] <james_woods> (Compared to 1.4)
[05:59:24] <Brutick> james_woods: You can assign id's to each of your dropdowns or use child selectors as you would in CSS
[05:59:39] <Brutick> or class selectors
[06:00:00] <Brutick> To be the most explicit and specific, I would use id's
[06:00:48] <Brutick> i.e. if you have <select id="MyDropdown"></select>, you can use $('#MyDropdown')
[06:01:02] <Brutick> exactly like you would in css
[06:01:46] <james_woods> Brutick: https://gist.github.com/James-Woods/4c9e614c955f8d9c9068#file-gistfile1-js-L9
[06:02:46] <james_woods> Brutick: this is the actual source which works in the live version. now in the development version it is not reacting to Line 9 but Line 14 which is more general then the direct adressing
[06:04:17] <james_woods> Brutick: AFAIK I'm currently using that form of adresssing
[06:04:47] <james_woods> s/than/then
[06:04:58] <james_woods> Oo s/then/than I meant
[06:06:30] <Brutick> james_woods: For me, I've had bad luck with doing string additions in line with jQuery, i.e. line 5. $("#" + v)
[06:06:55] <Brutick> Try creating the string beforehand and then using it for the selector.
[06:07:17] <Brutick> I ran into an issue once where it was picky about this... never was sure why
[06:07:22] <software> hello
[06:07:50] <software> my chosen dropdownlist appears as list not as dropdown in IE in the test server
[06:07:59] <software> but it is coming fine in my computer
[06:08:17] <james_woods> Brutick: thank you! i will try that
[06:08:29] <software> any help pls
[06:08:58] <Brutick> software: Sounds like you're missing the css that controls the dropdown's style
[06:09:06] <Brutick> on the test server.
[06:10:38] <software> not missing
[06:11:01] <software> I have added that
[06:11:26] <Brutick> software: Do you think you can replicate the problem on a jsfiddle?
[06:12:16] <software> How can I do that
[06:12:51] <Brutick> Create the form on a jsfiddle with the same css and try to see if it renders improperly there too
[06:14:21] <james_woods> Brutick: does not work :/ - the checkbox selection is still "resettet" when the final update call goes out
[06:15:17] <bytephilia> How can I have many different jQuery sliders with different max values and default values?
[06:15:21] <bytephilia> (init values)
[06:15:41] <Brutick> james_woods: Aw man, hm I'm not sure what else to try :( possibly come back later when some of the experts are around D:
[06:15:56] <Brutick> i.e. Cork, j3tle
[06:16:36] <rabbi1> var sd = "2011:12:12";var repStr = ":";sd = sd.replace(repStr, ",");  - this replaces only the first occurance of ":" how can i replace all the occurances of ":'" ?

[06:27:03] <jop008> on jquery mobile I have a select list but the selected option is only visible when I click on it
[06:27:18] <_mak> Brutick: oh, thanks, I've found that on google... I'm searching for some indication really...
[06:27:19] <jop008> I want to have it visible in my <table
[06:27:36] <jop008> <select tag with selected option
[06:27:48] <Brutick> Fair enough
[06:35:24] <jop008> I have this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-07-04_at_3.33.20_PM-mPKG9wcy.png and this  http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-07-04_at_3.33.10_PM-AFs4K4Iw.png
[06:35:49] <jop008> I want to have Week visible in my row not only after I click on the select box
[06:39:49] <xec_> ?demo @ jop008
[06:39:49] <b-ot> jop008: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:43:22] <jop008> the screenshots does explain my problem well enough
[06:44:33] <Palani> Hi all.,
[06:45:30] <xec_> jop008: if you say so :) if you're not receiving the help you want, it might help with a live demo though
[06:45:39] <Palani> I have a master div with 10 div hidden.....When ever the master div drag on hidden div need to add class and display those div...It's possible
[06:45:42] <jop008> How can I influence the cell width in a table?
[06:45:47] <Palani> Please help me out
[06:45:55] <Palani> How to achieve it
[06:45:58] <jop008> now I have <th style='text-align:center' align='center' valign='center' data-priority="type">Type</th>
[06:46:24] <xec_> jop008: just use "width" in css
[06:46:27] <jop008> how is the width of the cell determined? I think it is to small
[06:46:59] <xec_> default behaviour of each table col is to take the space it need
[06:47:01] <xec_> needs*
[06:48:10] <jop008> Solved by using <th style='text-align:center;width:10em;' align='center' valign='center' data-priority="type">Type</th>
[06:48:22] <jop008> 10em makes it bigger
[06:49:37] <xec_> -.-
[06:50:39] <xec_> Palani: what do you have so far?
[07:06:20] <JelmerD> Guys. I have a quick question. http://pastebin.com/v1QcGn3j
[07:07:28] <JelmerD> I am developing a plugin, which is getting a bit complicated and I am building some callbacks for the user. One is giving the opportunity to parse your own value. It is possible to do this via Ajax. So, I need a callback for the programmer using the plugin.
[07:07:44] <JelmerD> Have a look at my example (I maded it very quicky, so it could contain an error) http://pastebin.com/v1QcGn3j
[07:08:23] <JelmerD> How do I give my programmer a callback which he can call after his ajax call? So that it won't kill the plugin? I really need this functionality (I hope I am clear enough)
[07:11:15] <JelmerD> I'm not clear. I just figured out it IS working. But how do I get back in touch with the plugin?
[07:11:36] <JelmerD> Because the "this" is undefined in the function. How do I get the plugin properties again?
[07:13:27] <xec_> JelmerD: i'm not 100% clear, but what if you (just like the callback function) supply it to the onclick option through a parameter
[07:13:51] <xec_> JelmerD: so line 2 would read onClick: function(callback, optionsObject) {
[07:14:12] <xec_> JelmerD: and you'd use optionsObject.whatever instead of this.whatever ?
[07:14:27] <JelmerD> xec: hi. Yep, I got that working. But now: when the callback function inside my plugin is called (callback in the example I gave). The "this" is undefined. So I can't access the properties of the plugin.
[07:14:55] <JelmerD> I don't feel like giving the whole object through the plugin callback (onClick). Or is that just the way to go?
[07:14:55] <xec_> ah, inside the pligin definition
[07:15:02] <JelmerD> xec: I guess, yes :)
[07:15:08] <xec_> just make a var for it, like var self = this;
[07:15:20] <JelmerD> I know it isn't that clear what I am saying.
[07:15:25] <xec_> and use `self` instead of `this`
[07:15:47] <xec_> actually
[07:15:51] <xec_> i'm confused too
[07:16:05] <xec_> you're trying to access what, where? :D
[07:16:32] <JelmerD> xec: I understand that you are confused. Let me get you another pastebin.
[07:19:01] <sammich> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/zen-photon-garden/launch
[07:19:08] <sammich> so pretty
[07:20:24] <JelmerD> xec: http://pastebin.com/LYNp8wXe
[07:20:28] <JelmerD> I hope that makes sense?
[07:22:00] <JelmerD> xec: so, in the plugin.callback(), I can use the data I received from the ajax call. So that part is working. but now I need another method from the plugin, which I can not access anymore because the "this" I was using earlier isn't containing the right object anymore. Do you understand?
[07:22:31] <xec_> JelmerD: yes i think i see where you're going. can i see the whole code for the plugin
[07:22:38] <JelmerD> Which is obvious. So now my question is: how do I get control of the plugin again?
[07:22:55] <xec_> JelmerD: most likely you can name the object and refer to the name instead of using `this`
[07:23:19] <xec_> OR
[07:23:29] <xec_> no, nevermind
[07:23:38] <xec_> i had an idea but it wouldnt work ;D
[07:23:48] <JelmerD> xec: http://pastebin.com/39p3m815
[07:24:09] <JelmerD> xec: there are some fixed classes and stuff, but that doesn't matter. It is used "in company" only ;-)
[07:24:20] <JelmerD> When I make it public public, I will fix that stuff.
[07:25:09] <xec_> JelmerD: on line 30 you name it "Plugin" already, try "Plugin.whateverMethod"
[07:25:43] <xec_> (instead of this.whateverMethod)
[07:26:17] <DannyZB> I'm trying to replace "live" "on" and there is one thing i don't get
[07:26:46] <DannyZB> i have a plugin function that accepts a set of objects ( $(this) or whatever ) ... how do I use .on in that case ? I have only the objects , not the selector
[07:27:06] <xec_> DannyZB: what sort of objects?
[07:27:18] <DannyZB> divs in this case
[07:27:36] <xec_> jquery objects?
[07:27:40] <DannyZB> yea
[07:27:52] <xec_> you can call .on() directly on those, i guess
[07:27:59] <JelmerD> xec: isn't working. It is creating a new instance or something. Becuae Plugin.$rows is undefined, which should at least contain 5 jQuery objects
[07:28:14] <DannyZB> won't work ... needs to be delegated because .on only applies to already existing elements
[07:28:22] <DannyZB> *non-delegated .on
[07:28:35] <xec_> but you have the elements in objects already..?
[07:28:54] <DannyZB> woah .. good point ><
[07:29:38] <DannyZB> the elements still don't exist .. I want the same effect as $(".selector").live("contextmenu",function(){});
[07:30:17] <xec_> well, that would be $(document).on("contextmenu", ".selector", func..)
[07:30:20] <DannyZB> since it's a plugin function I can only use -this- as reference
[07:30:34] <xec_> DannyZB: and the plugin is using .live() already?
[07:30:38] <DannyZB> yes
[07:30:42] <xec_> DannyZB: with what arguments?
[07:30:56] <DannyZB> ugh I think this plugin is broken you're right ..
[07:31:12] <JelmerD> xec: also: calling the methods will throw some errors in the console, because some variables are unknown which are defined in the Plugin.init() method. So I can confirm a new object is used. So I guess the only way of achieving what I like is passing the whole "this" through the onNewRowTrigger(). So than I can use "obj.addNewRow" in my ajax success callback.
[07:31:27] <JelmerD> I guess that is the way to go. Makes it less retard proof. But I guess I have to deal with it.
[07:32:43] <xec_> JelmerD: well, you should be able to have a local reference to it. somewhere "this" is what it should be and you should be able to save/cache it in a var and then refer to that
[07:33:11] <xec_> JelmerD: but it's a bit too much code to understand every bit of just by glancing, and i gotta go
[07:35:02] <JelmerD> xec: self.options.onNewRowTrigger(function(html){self.addNewRow(html)}, self.newRowId); is working.
[07:35:31] <JelmerD> so defining a new function and using that as the callback which calls the correct method. I guess it can be done better, but it is going in the right direciton.
[07:35:49] <xec_> JelmerD: good luck ;)
[07:35:53] <JelmerD> Maybe I did something wrong in the first callback method, but this should help getting the flow straight :p
[07:36:39] <JelmerD> xec: thank you. When this plugin is finished it should remove 6x-duplicated code. And it will be reusable in future projects. So thats nice :)
[07:48:04] <ph88> function()  {  this ...;    $('#somediv').on('click', function(e){         how do i get this here?            });   }
[07:54:59] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[07:55:19] <RonWhoCares> I set the following up so the accordion interface would apply to the DIV:  $( "#portal_maintenance_entry_history_record" ).accordion();   But when I use jQuery AJAX to populate the same DIV with new content the accordion functionality doesn't apply.  Is there a way to enable this?
[07:56:15] <Bloomberg> Someone know how can I edit the properties of header content of tab widget of jquery?
[07:57:46] <wroathe> What do you mean by "properties of header content"
[07:58:06] <Bloomberg> I need to change the color nad more properties
[07:58:07] <wroathe> The text? Attributes of a specific element?
[07:58:12] <Bloomberg> yes
[07:58:34] <wroathe> For color, css, for everything else $.fn.attr or $.fn.prop
[07:59:22] <ph88> hey why is this not fading in ?? http://jsfiddle.net/gYbcW/
[07:59:35] <Bloomberg> <a href="http://imgur.com/dlj0Tfr"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dlj0Tfr.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a>
[07:59:54] <Bloomberg> I'm speaking about that
[07:59:56] <Saaether> ph88 http://jsfiddle.net/gYbcW/1/
[08:00:07] <wroathe> http://jsfiddle.net/gYbcW/2/
[08:00:13] <wroathe> Saaether: You beat me to it
[08:00:14] <ph88> Saaether:  ah it needs to be hiden first ... ok
[08:00:23] <Bloomberg> I need to change style properties of that header
[08:01:01] <wroathe> Bloomberg: Add a class to that header, then use that class to write styles
[08:01:07] <ph88> Saaether:  i settle for this now http://jsfiddle.net/gYbcW/3/
[08:01:36] <wroathe> $('#tabs > a').addClass('tab-header');
[08:01:38] <wroathe> or something like that
[08:01:40] <joker_89> hi
[08:02:00] <joker_89> how can i catch the last div class name of 2 diferent div classes?
[08:02:48] <joker_89> :/
[08:04:24] <Bloomberg> wroathe: I'm sorry but ask many times, but where can I add the class If I just start the widget with :: $("#tabs").tabs();
[08:05:11] <wroathe> Bloomberg: Well, presumably you have access ot the HTML that $.fn.tabs is tabifying
[08:05:41] <wroathe> joker_89: $('.foo').attr('class').split(/\s+/).pop()
[08:05:46] <RonWhoCares> Do any of you know how to get the accordion feature to work with a jQuery AJAX?
[08:05:59] <rabbi1> Cork: u there ?
[08:06:05] <Cork> ya
[08:06:23] <wroathe> RonWhoCares: Yes.
[08:06:25] <joker_89> $('.foo').attr('class').split(/\s+/).pop() what does that?
[08:06:40] <happyfac1> anyone know why my dev server keeps serving old code? I have to delete pyc files manually each time
[08:06:45] <RonWhoCares> could you help me?
[08:07:16] <wroathe> joker_89: 1. Get the classes .foo has (returns string with space delimited class names). 2. Split that on whitespace 3. .pop() gets last class
[08:07:49] <wroathe> RonWhoCares: Maybe
[08:07:50] <bealtine> RonWhoCares: what mean jquery ajax?
[08:08:04] <wroathe> No, he means A jquery AJAX
[08:08:08] <wroathe> different thing entirely
[08:08:10] <bealtine> accordion works fine with jquery
[08:08:29] <RonWhoCares> bealtine: Yes I do
[08:09:03] <bealtine> why would ajax know anything about accordions?
[08:09:10] <bealtine> sigh
[08:10:15] <rabbi1> Cork: remember our code of appending new objects ?
[08:10:45] <Cork> appending new objects?
[08:10:47] <Cork> no i don't
[08:10:54] <rabbi1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Nskw5/2/
[08:10:58] <RonWhoCares> My connection re-set.
[08:11:29] <Cork> rabbi1: that restructures a data set, it doesn't really append anything
[08:11:38] <RonWhoCares> This is what I have for the accordion jQuery:  $(document).ready(function() { 	$( "#portal_maintenance_entry_history_record" ).accordion();   })    It works fine for when the web page loads.  But this rule isn't applying to when I populate #portal_maintenance_entry_history_record with my jQuery AJAX
[08:12:06] <rabbi1> i have used the current date and compared with the date in the objects. …. How can i add new object to the parent object ?
[08:13:46] <wroathe> RonWhoCares: It kind of seems like you really should be learning a bit more about Javascript and jQuery before building an AJAXified Accordion
[08:13:47] <Cork> rabbi1: parent?, what parent?
[08:15:06] <rabbi1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Nskw5/3/
[08:16:26] <rabbi1> Cork: if you can see that new object ud: "something1" i need to push that object to the above object
[08:16:41] <rabbi1> is that possible ?
[08:17:07] <RonWhoCares> wroate I have been using jQuery for a few years.  I just haven't done so within the context of an AJAX
[08:17:29] <wroathe> using, clearly not understanding :P
[08:18:40] <rabbi1> Cork: ok, please forget it. that will be a bad idea… sorry
[08:19:21] <rabbi1> Can u just guide me on using the filter() depending on the second level object and display the entire first object
[08:19:25] <james_woods> Hi, I have a really weird issue with jQuery UI and event handling. With my development version and the current version of jquery the event in Line 14 is fired, but it shouldnt be. Just the Event in line 9 should react to the multiselect widget. Was there some change in the handling of events? https://gist.github.com/James-Woods/4c9e614c955f8d9c9068#file-gistfile1-js-L9
[08:19:55] <james_woods> (its working in my live version and an old version of jquery)
[08:20:43] <james_woods> maybe now its a problem to have whitespaces in ids?
[08:20:58] <wroathe> james_woods: Is this the widget you're using: http://www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget?
[08:21:11] <james_woods> wroathe: yes
[08:21:38] <wroathe> https://github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/blob/master/src/jquery.multiselect.js line 395
[08:22:23] <james_woods> wroathe: damn. So I need to rename my "change" function I guess
[08:28:03] <ph88> function()  {  this ...;    $('#somediv').on('click', function(e){         how do i get this here?            });   }
[08:28:30] <james_woods> wroathe: hmm that doesnt seem to solve the problem.. $('#r select').change(function () is still reacting when I click something in the dropdown, while it should only react on close
[08:28:46] <Cork> ph88: save this in a variable in the outer function and use it in the inner
[08:29:08] <james_woods> wroathe: or do I need to adress that issue inside of the widget and rewrite that?
[08:29:25] <rabbi1> Cork: I am sorry, here is the simplified fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/Nskw5/4/  is there a way i can get the keys, and values of object where flag = true and flag = false and the length…..
[08:32:16] <rabbi1> I am trying something like this http://jsfiddle.net/Nskw5/5/
[08:32:39] <wroathe> james_woods: I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish, so I can't answer that.
[08:34:17] <james_woods> wroathe: yeeeeah. I wanted to change that the widget fires an update so that the site reloads everytime somebody unchecks something and the widget gets closed (very annoying) now I just commented line 395 out and it works like I want it to
[08:34:41] <james_woods> wroathe: so now you have to close the dropdown and the update call gets fired
[08:35:23] <james_woods> wroathe: instead of everytime you uncheck / check something, the site refreshes and you look at a closed dropdown (which you will have to reopen to check/uncheck more options)
[08:35:35] <ph88> Cork:  i'm trying that ... it works ... though that transitionend event gets fired too soon .... http://pastebin.com/BPE3CMy3   i'm trying to get something like this   http://jsfiddle.net/3DFDL/
[08:39:37] <wroathe> james_woods: Sure... Whatever floats your goat.
[08:40:08] <wroathe> RonWhoCares: This is a recent accordion widget I built: http://streetcar.brandshakecreative.com/where-will-the-streetcar-go/
[08:40:13] <wroathe> RonWhoCares: Maybe that'll give you some ideas.
[08:40:50] <ph88> have to go, byeee
[08:41:46] <james_woods> wroathe: Maybe that was not easy to understand or you must think that my way of doing this is wrong (?)
[08:42:30] <grafi> wroathe that looks really nice
[08:46:15] <RonWhoCares> wroathe:  http://jsfiddle.net/HHQmA/1/    I put in the comment " # the following is what I am trying to display as an accordion "
[08:54:15] <lenswipe> hey guys
[08:57:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I do this: $("#content-area").css({"height" : (sidebarheight-59) + "px"});
[08:58:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> The height is correct in firefox, but not in Chrome
[08:58:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Chrome just uses the default height...
[08:58:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone know why?
[09:00:01] <FJ> somebody here with knowhow for tinymce?
[09:02:44] <davezZz> 'lo, what's the most efficient way to have an 'undo' for a div content change
[09:02:56] <davezZz> so i change the content of a div using .html().. but i have a button to revert it
[09:03:10] <NoiseEee> davezZz: i guess store the contents before you change it?
[09:03:25] <davezZz> so that wouldn't be mega laggy or nothing?
[09:03:41] <NoiseEee> davezZz: you can test, but i can't see why it would be ?

[09:04:17] <grafi> ._.
[09:04:35] <davezZz> oh, ill have multiple divs.. im just wondering if that will cause issues with storing the contents of a div in a variable?
[09:05:57] <davezZz> that would be stored in a cookie?
[09:06:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> var sidebarheight = $("#sidebar").outerHeight();
[09:06:28] <NoiseEee> davezZz: don't bother with a cookie unless you want the content after a page reload/change.
[09:06:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that gives different results in chrome and firefox!
[09:06:36] <NoiseEee> davezZz: a JS object/variable will do fine
[09:06:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Chrome says 1300 and firefox says 3000+
[09:06:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How can it be? Is it a bug?
[09:07:42] <davezZz> i change the contents of a div after resizing an image, it is now previewing an image.. and then i want to click a link/button/div to undo so the image can be redited
[09:08:00] <davezZz> i just cant think of how to do it without having a few empty divtags
[09:08:04] <davezZz> and just hiding/unhiding
[09:08:20] <davezZz> i.. could just hide and unhide.. hrm ;/
[09:08:24] <NoiseEee> indeed

[09:12:19] <darkfrog> libin: does css('position', 'fixed') not work?
[09:12:44] <darkfrog> lenswipe: to my knowledge you can't "focus" a div
[09:13:08] <lenswipe> darkfrog, you can focus a contenteditable div - however I mean like this:

[09:17:54] <darkfrog> libin: you could just absolute positioning and add a listener to scrolling to create the same effect (old-school way it was done before 'fixed')

[09:18:57] <jop008> I have already 2 libs with date stuff in my project
[09:19:02] <lenswipe> darkfrog, grafi because jQuery can do things like only collapse the div if it's empty - whereas CSS can't
[09:19:26] <lenswipe> darkfrog, grafi and as the people in #CSS confirmed - even if you could, it's not really a job for CSS (I thought as much)
[09:19:33] <NoiseEee> jop008: then surely one of those libs can do what you want?
[09:19:46] <darkfrog> lenswipe: fair enough....$(textarea).focus(function() { $(textarea).animate(...); });
[09:19:50] <grafi> makes sense lenswipe
[09:19:51] <grafi> :)
[09:19:56] <jop008> what is the default format for datestring?
[09:20:10] <lenswipe> thank you
[09:20:22] <jop008> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[09:20:32] <NoiseEee> jop008: mdn, not w3schools
[09:20:46] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: stop being such a snob. :o
[09:20:53] <jop008> ms is not so into standards
[09:20:55] <NoiseEee> its more about accuracy.
[09:21:00] <NoiseEee> mdn is mozilla
[09:21:04] <NoiseEee> www.w3fools.com
[09:21:11] <grafi> NoiseEee++
[09:21:21] <darkfrog> NoiseEee: I'm aware, but in most cases w3schools is fine
[09:21:48] <darkfrog> and sadly in many cases it provides more information than MDN
[09:21:50] <NoiseEee> darkfrog: theres no reason to visit a site with innacurate information and give it page views, etc etc, but whatever
[09:22:38] <darkfrog> MDN may be "complete" in the respect that it lists all values, but it doesn't always provide any description whatsoever
[09:34:59] <Tumulte> Are you aware of a wysiwyg editor compatible with jquery2 ?
[09:35:28] <jop008> ostartdate = new Date (oel.value); this gives invalid date
[09:35:39] <jop008> run from the console give me a good date
[09:36:02] <gordian> anyone know if it's possible to live edit jQuery in the Safari debugging tools?
[09:36:18] <gordian> i've seen some stackoverflow posts on it but they're aging
[09:36:55] <NoiseEee> jop008: maybe oel isn't defined?
[09:37:25] <jop008> from the console ostartdate = new Date (oel.value)
[09:37:26] <jop008> Sat Jul 20 2013 02:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)
[09:37:34] <jop008> oel.value is defined
[09:37:34] <stephen_camilo> how do I select all elements with a class till the next element with a diferent class?
[09:37:50] <jop008> string with this 2013-07-20
[09:37:51] <NoiseEee> jop008: but is it defined in the function you call / at the time you call it?
[09:38:13] <jop008> yep  var oel = document.getElementById ("startdate_flex");
[09:38:22] <jop008> and oel is got okay
[09:41:41] <jop008> yep oel is defined at call time
[09:43:32] <jop008> so why do I have a good date on the console and not in my code?
[09:43:45] <NoiseEee> fire up your debugger

[09:54:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How to detect the browser with jquery?
[09:54:19] <blaizco> Hi there. I am setting an img src in jquery and works fine in a Desktop Browser. However, when I go to Android 2.x it doesn't work. Any ideas?
[09:55:11] <jedimind> NoiseEee:  im that one guy, right?
[09:55:45] <NoiseEee> jedimind: obv!
[09:55:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $.browser.chrome is not working anymore
[09:56:02] <jedimind> i knew that's what you were thinking
[09:59:27] <blaizco> Hi there. I am setting an img src in jquery and works fine in a Desktop Browser. However, when I go to Android 2.x it doesn't work. Any ideas?

[10:08:19] <blaizco> I have fixed
[10:13:05] <jop008> can you end debugger on the console?
[10:18:08] <hems> how can i select with regexp ? imaginary code: $( 'a[href=/(.*)_admin/]' )
[10:19:02] <NoiseEee> http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/ @ hems
[10:19:55] <NoiseEee> hems: 2nd one listed, $('a[href$="_admin"]') should work iirc
[10:20:38] <hems> cheers
[10:20:53] <hems> i just realised i could use $( 'a[href$=admin]' )
[10:21:30] <vBm> Does anyone have an idea where could i find original unmodified fancybox 2.0.3 ? (there's no such release tagged on their official github page) I need it so i can compare it with this outdated website i have to rebuild for any internal changes -.-
[10:22:52] <tw2113> vBm, worth considering upgrading them
[10:23:15] <Saaether> dont know if its been modified, but heres a 2.0.3 from some guys site http://brycedavis.com/scripts/jquery.fancybox-2.0.3/jquery.fancybox.js
[10:24:14] <vBm> tw2113, that's what i'm planning on doing .. first i want to be sure that there's no some crappy changes by previous dude who did the gallery :) ... and then use the latest one
[10:24:25] <vBm> thanks Saaether
[10:25:24] <tw2113> why does it matter if you're just going to upgrade any way?
[10:25:41] <Saaether> because he may lose some custom code in the process
[10:25:47] <vBm> that ^
[10:26:12] <tw2113> *shrug*
[10:26:26] <vBm> Saaether, that helped ... it seems he changed some of 'defaults'
[10:26:28] <tw2113> not my concern, do what you must
[10:27:00] <vBm> templates were changed heh
[10:27:14] <tw2113> ironic that, unless the fancybox dev doesn't do what most jQuery plugins do, you can pass in your own params that get merged with the untouched defaults
[10:27:25] <tw2113> if using the plugin correctly
[10:58:19] <vorrin> howdy
[10:58:52] <vorrin> I have a function using .click() and animate() and scrollTop() , which works just fine on pc, but not on an android phone
[10:59:06] <vorrin> (I have two buttons, that scroll content within a div where overflow is hidden)

[11:12:40] <flangefrog> hi there, I've got an event handler an element with a certain class, once that handler fires the class is removed and added to a different element. The problem is that firing the event on the new element does not call the handler. I am guessing I need to update the handler somehow?
[11:17:47] <Cork> flangefrog: the best solution is to use a delegated event handler
[11:17:58] <Cork> flangefrog: then it would just work by it self
[11:18:24] <Cork> flangefrog: $('common parent').on('event', '.class-name', function() {});
[11:21:35] <flangefrog> thanks, that looks good, but I need the selector to be $('.current').prev() or $('.current').next() and the it only accepts a selector
[11:35:54] <LowValueTarget> Is there a handlebarsjs channel

[11:49:14] <LowValueTarget> alexr2: had issues with custom block helpers
[11:49:16] <LowValueTarget> fixed it though

[12:24:03] <lenswipe> hey guys
[12:25:21] <alexr2> Hi
[12:26:24] <lenswipe> can someone help me understand how to use $.animate() ?
[12:26:45] <lenswipe> I want to start at 100px and then slowly expand a div to 300px and then (possibly back again)
[12:31:15] <Cork> lenswipe: .css('width', '100px').animate({ width: '300px'}, 5000).animate({ width: '100px'}, 5000);
[12:33:18] <lenswipe> Cork, thank you
[12:33:30] <KucukMubasir> Cork, I need your help for the last time. I am changing an element's text in a for loop, but that doesn't change instantly; what am I doing wrong?
[12:33:31] <KucukMubasir> $($.find("#content-section a, #content-section h1")[0]).text((index+1)+"")
[12:33:31] <KucukMubasir> only the last change is shown, I want it to iterate
[12:33:59] <Cork> O_o
[12:34:05] <alexr2> oO indeed
[12:34:05] <alexr2> haha
[12:34:23] <alexr2> $(selector).first().text(index + 1)
[12:34:40] <KucukMubasir> alexr2: ?
[12:34:48] <KucukMubasir> am I doing something wrong or rudimentary ?
[12:34:54] <Cork> KucukMubasir: your code is way overcomplicated
[12:35:02] <alexr2> ^^
[12:35:35] <KucukMubasir> forget the find() I want text("...") to be changed instantly in a for loop
[12:35:37] <Cork> KucukMubasir: also the page doesn't render until your code ends
[12:35:44] <KucukMubasir> do I have to use setTimeout
[12:35:48] <KucukMubasir> oh
[12:35:57] <Cork> KucukMubasir: so if you want to make something like a timer show the number in an element
[12:36:02] <KucukMubasir> then how might javascript based chronometers work?
[12:36:05] <Cork> you need to use timers to let the browser work
[12:36:14] <KucukMubasir> I did, I tried it :/
[12:36:59] <KucukMubasir> I just call setTimeout(myFunc,1000) in the loop yet the element's content still doesn't change instantly
[12:37:18] <Cork> KucukMubasir: function update(index) { setTimeout(function() { update(++index) }, 100); } update(0);
[12:37:41] <Cork> KucukMubasir: the timer needs to be the loop
[12:37:46] <Cork> you can't use a code loop
[12:37:57] <KucukMubasir> thanks Cork
[12:38:07] <Cork> KucukMubasir: function update(index) { /* your code goes here */ setTimeout(function() { update(++index) }, 100); } update(0);
[12:39:25] <KucukMubasir> Cork, and I need to return when I reach the index ?
[12:39:56] <Cork> KucukMubasir: if(index >= end_value) { return; }
[12:40:27] <KucukMubasir> it is recursive it doesn't overflow the stack right?
[12:40:48] <Cork> KucukMubasir: it's actually flat, cause it isn't actually recursive
[12:41:02] <Cork> it queues a new timer every time it finish
[12:41:13] <Cork> and the browser calls the function again
[12:41:15] <Cork> <_<
[12:41:19] * Cork pokes freenode
[12:41:45] <alexr2> careful, it might poke back
[12:42:54] <Cork> KucukMubasir: so it is actually never more then two levels deep (with exception of the first time it's called (update(0))
[13:06:01] <`RobW> hmm
[13:06:05] <`RobW> let's say I make a json call
[13:06:13] <`RobW> and the data returned has 3 parameters in the callback..
[13:06:21] <`RobW> first two i'm using, the 3rd is a function name that I'd like to fire
[13:06:25] <`RobW> how can I go about this?
[13:07:00] <alexr2> window[funcname]()
[13:07:16] <alexr2> assuming it's some global function
[13:08:06] <`RobW> it's not
[13:08:12] <`RobW> it's inside my $(function() { })
[13:08:30] <alexr2> then someinstance[funcname]
[13:08:33] <alexr2> ()
[13:09:11] <`RobW> well since i'm using a closure i'll just move the function to global. thanks
[13:12:36] <wad> Hi guys. I'm a jquery noob, just learning it. Been googling on how to properly enable and disable buttons, but I'm confused, and I haven't found anything authortative. Why are there two parameters to the attr() method? $("#buttonZ").removeAttr('disabled', true);
[13:12:48] <NoiseEee> wad: you should be using $('#buttonZ').prop('disabled',true)
[13:13:11] <wad> NoiseEee, okay, thanks. Google turned up a number of different ways to do it, wasn't sure what was correct.
[13:13:21] <wad> What is the second parameter?
[13:13:40] <NoiseEee> wad: what to set the property to
[13:13:45] <wad> Ah, okay!
[13:13:48] <wad> That makes sense.
[13:14:15] <wad> So to enable it, I set disabled to false. Got it.
[13:21:57] <Goopyo> how do you grab the body of a $.get() data response? I tried $(data).find('body') but that didnt work
[13:37:56] <alexr2> Goopyo, the second or third parameter that you pass into $.get should be a function.. it's a callback, the first parameter that it sends back is your dresponse
[13:37:59] <alexr2> respones*
[13:38:02] <alexr2> response***
[13:38:04] <alexr2> yeesh
[13:38:09] <Goopyo> figured it out. Thanks!
[13:42:39] <funhouse> Does anyone know how to keep the texture in when overriding the background color for buttons?
[13:44:33] <tw2113> wouldn't that be a background iamge?
[13:44:35] <tw2113> image even
[13:48:38] <horacsio> eddie?
[13:48:44] <horacsio> eddiemonge?
[14:04:26] <funhouse> tw2113: yeah just wondering what to put tho.
[14:05:43] <tw2113> undo what you changed and retrieve the original value
[14:22:53] <funhouse> tw2113: how do you get the css of an element?
[14:30:28] <tw2113> your neighborhood friendly firefox/chrome inspector tools
[14:30:37] <tw2113> or firebug if you're still on that addon
[14:37:24] <funhouse> tw2113: ok yeah, I meant in jquery but yeah checked it out, found the line in the css file, but now it wont even change the color
[14:38:00] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[14:38:42] <alexr2> funhouse $(selector).css("width")
[14:38:43] <Bloomberg> Someone know how can I get some info about the active tab on widget jquery?
[14:38:45] <alexr2> or whatever css you need
[14:39:16] <alexr2> Bloomberg: can you elaborate?
[14:39:24] <Bloomberg> what?
[14:40:01] <Bloomberg> For example when you click on tab automatically show you in an alert the div of tab
[14:40:59] <Bloomberg> Understand me?
[14:41:26] <funhouse> alexr2: ok, but is there a way to retrieve them all?
[14:43:53] <alexr2> on a tab in your browser or on a tab like bootstrap tabs?
[14:44:16] <alexr2> ahh missed the last part of your sentence
[14:44:33] <Bloomberg> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[14:44:35] <Bloomberg> this
[14:44:41] <alexr2> take a look at the .click or .on events
[14:45:01] <Bloomberg> When you click another tab show you the id in alert event
[14:45:57] <funhouse> Ok so check this out --> http://jsfiddle.net/X4jNH/
[14:46:11] <alexr2> funhouse: I don't know of any built in functionality, but check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1004475/jquery-css-plugin-that-returns-computed-style-of-element-to-pseudo-clone-that-el
[14:46:17] <funhouse> Check out when it hovers, it loses the texture gradient completely
[14:46:27] <funhouse> I want to keep the texture.
[14:46:42] <funhouse> Ok thank you alexr2 and thank you tw2113
[14:47:37] <megalomix> hello guys
[14:47:50] <Bloomberg> help me plz!!
[14:47:50] <megalomix> how can i get a complete list of h2 with a specific class name inside the page?
[14:48:28] <Bloomberg> megalomix: explain a lot better you halp because I don't get?
[14:48:29] <Bloomberg> !
[14:48:46] <alexr2> megalomix: $(h2.someclass)
[14:48:58] <alexr2> rather $('h2.someclass')
[14:49:17] <Bloomberg> alexr2: What you will suggest me ?
[14:49:52] <alexr2> api on @Bloomberg
[14:50:03] <evilgeenius> Hi all. I need to implement an image picker, but it needs to work with IE6 (it'll be used in china).  The simplest and most basic way to do this in HTML is to put checkboxes next to the images.  Could I do something better where the user could click on the images themselves?  that works with IE6?
[14:50:08] <alexr2> `api on @Bloomberg
[14:50:13] <b-ot> Bloomberg: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:50:13] <alexr2> meh silly bot
[14:50:18] <alexr2> there it goes
[14:50:44] <funhouse> Does anyone see this issue I'm having? --> http://jsfiddle.net/X4jNH/
[14:50:49] <megalomix>  $('h2.someclass')
[14:51:32] <alexr2> funhouse, if you want the hover state to have a gradient, you need to add the gradient in your css as well
[14:51:37] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/anaqaw/1/edit
[14:51:39] <Bloomberg> See this
[14:52:22] <Bloomberg> I need to get the id when click a new tab
[14:53:16] <alexr2> to get which id?
[14:53:25] <alexr2> you have only 1 id in there
[14:53:38] <Bloomberg> id="tabs-8"
[14:53:41] <Bloomberg> id="tabs-9"
[14:53:44] <Bloomberg> id="tabs-7"
[14:53:45] <Bloomberg> etc
[14:54:11] <Bloomberg> So when I click the 7 tab show me in aan alert(tabs-7)
[14:55:19] <alexr2> so you're clicking on element a, and you want the id of element b?
[14:55:24] <funhouse> alexr2: I tried that { background: #00c0ff url("http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.2/themes/base/images/ui-bg_glass_75_e6e6e6_1x400.png") repeat-x scroll 50% 50%; }
[14:55:25] <Bloomberg> some like :::  $('#tabs:selected').attr('id')
[14:57:05] <funhouse> alexr2: http://jsfiddle.net/hR5Bb/ -->
[14:57:28] <Bloomberg> funhouse: What do you need man?
[14:57:29] <alexr2> i guess you could do something like $("^=tabs-").is(":visible")?
[14:57:33] <alexr2> not sure if that'll work though
[14:58:25] <funhouse> Bloomberg: I need to the gradient to stay --> http://jsfiddle.net/X4jNH/
[14:58:36] <funhouse> Bloomberg: on hover, check it out.
[14:58:39] <shoky> funhouse: the background color is just there as a fallback. the .png is not transparent i believe, so any color "behind" it will get drawn over by the png
[14:58:53] <alexr2> ^^
[14:58:56] <shoky> funhouse: you'll need to provide your own gradient like alexr2 says
[14:58:56] <funhouse> shoky: ok but In theme roller it changes fine.
[14:59:04] <alexr2> funhouse, you can do gradients with css (not background image)
[15:00:34] <funhouse> alexr2: guess I'll have to, its just jquery made such a nice button widget, shame they wouldn't give you more flexibilty without having to create an entirely new theme.
[15:00:43] <shoky> funhouse: you're right it works there, but they create a new .png for your changed background
[15:00:52] <funhouse> shoky: I see.
[15:01:01] <shoky> so you can just use the themeroller and take the png it generates ;p
[15:01:28] <funhouse> shoky: Yes will probably do that, thank you and everyone.
[15:03:04] <shoky> and i guess the png is somewhat transparent
[15:03:14] <shoky> but it's still colored according to the bg color
[15:05:50] <alexr2> `eval(1+1)
[15:05:58] <alexr2> `eval 1+1
[15:06:11] <alexr2> guess you need permissions for that huh
[15:06:14] <shoky> ?js eval(1+1)
[15:06:17] <bot-t> shoky: 2
[15:06:17] <shoky> oops
[15:06:29] <alexr2> ?js eval(1-1)
[15:06:30] <bot-t> alexr2: 0
[15:06:41] <shoky> b-ot had one too but i forgot how
[15:06:45] <shoky> `js 1+1
[15:07:07] <megalomix> guys if i do $('h2.class') get a list of all h2 with this class...but how can i jump the element that have more than one class?
[15:07:17] <megalomix> <h2 class="one two">
[15:07:25] <alexr2> h2.class1.class2
[15:07:28] <megalomix> i only want the element with "one" (only)
[15:07:40] <alexr2> $('h2.class1').not('.class2')
[15:08:04] <megalomix> alexr2, i do not know the class...maybe it could be two three four etc etc
[15:08:17] <megalomix> can i only looking for "one" without any other class?
[15:08:34] <alexr2> hmm, i don't think there's anything built in to do that specifically
[15:09:00] <shoky> $('h2.one[class=one]')  :S
[15:09:05] <alexr2> or that, that works
[15:09:07] <alexr2> :-P
[15:09:08] <shoky> (and i kept the .one there for performance)
[15:09:17] <shoky> welp at least i think that'll perform ok
[15:09:22] <megalomix> shoky, do i need to repeat it ?
[15:09:38] <shoky> megalomix: it'll work even if you don't but will be slower i think
[15:09:57] <megalomix> ah ok perfect
[15:10:04] <alexr2> i always forget that class is also an attribute
[15:10:06] <alexr2> *shrug*
[15:10:10] <megalomix> :D
[15:10:13] <megalomix> thank you guys!
[15:11:28] <megalomix> can i also put a condition inside? i mean.... that i do not want any id set
[15:11:44] <shoky> why :\
[15:11:49] <megalomix> <h2 class="one"> <h2 class="one" id="bla">
[15:11:59] <megalomix> shoky, i only need to get the first WITHOUT id
[15:12:07] <shoky> yes. why :\
[15:12:10] <megalomix> only to understand how can i do this kind of "conditions"
[15:12:27] <shoky> :not([id])  i guess
[15:14:14] <alexr2> shoky, is there any benefit to doing the selector as opposed to the function?
[15:14:28] <megalomix> k
[15:15:59] <shoky> alexr2: nope
[15:17:38] <shoky> i usually use the function, fwiw
[15:18:29] <alexr2> ditto, i feel like it's less sloppy
[15:20:10] <shoky> docs also say:  The .not() method will end up providing you with more readable selections than pushing complex selectors or variables into a :not() selector filter. In most cases, it is a better choice.
[16:38:07] <Gazpacho> fuckin w3schools
[16:38:15] <PixelGrinch> why ?
[16:38:24] <Gazpacho> it sucks
[16:38:29] <Gazpacho> it lies
[16:38:50] <PixelGrinch> they are not w3c they just piggy bag on w3c potentially misleading ppl
[16:38:59] <Gazpacho> exactly
[16:39:24] <PixelGrinch> on that note i agree and they are not willing to point out this fact on their website …
[16:39:51] <PixelGrinch> did they snag you for any of their paid courses ?
[16:40:02] <Gazpacho> horrors no
[16:40:16] <PixelGrinch> :) … what happened ?
[16:40:24] <Gazpacho> i just did a search and they came up first
[16:40:38] <Gazpacho> and 2nd and 3rd
[16:41:04] <tw2113> aren't there extensions to weed out search results
[16:41:05] <PixelGrinch> I know it … it blows big times … since they charge for their courses they do have the means to invest in seo
[16:41:12] <PixelGrinch> there should be
[16:42:02] <PixelGrinch> i think you can do this:
[16:42:20] <Gazpacho> don't click the link
[16:42:28] <PixelGrinch> Some Search -site:www.sitename.com
[16:42:28] <Gazpacho> thta works well enough
[16:42:44] <Ansikt> whenever I search for something js related, I always append mdn to it
[16:43:18] <PixelGrinch> example:
[16:43:19] <PixelGrinch> html form -site:www.w3schools.com
[16:44:08] <PixelGrinch> This excludes all crap from www.w3schools.com
[16:44:25] <tw2113> i just tweeted at duckduckgo to see if there was a permanent setting
[16:45:00] <shoky> google had one until a few months ago ;(
[16:45:11] <shoky> then i installed an extension for it
[16:46:07] <tw2113> i stopped using google, but that doesn't help me with my new search
[17:05:48] <RonWhoCares> Earlier today I setup a jQuery AjAX to populate a form (with PHP running the database quey)   Is there any other way to remember which database record # I am editing than by creating a session variable?
[17:22:39] <wad> Hi folks. So I just discovered jQueryUI. So perfect! I chose my theme, downloaded my good stuff, and put in a "tabs" widget. Lovely! Now I want the header of my page to have the same theme as the other stuff. I looked through the provided .css file, but I don't see anything jumping out at me, that I should use.
[17:22:45] <wad> What's the right thing to do?
[18:11:46] <wad> Hi guys, I'm building a website app with jQueryUI, and I have a quesiton.
[18:11:59] <wad> How do I use the nice theme for, say, the title bar of the website?
[18:12:16] <wad> All the themey stuff applies to the widgets, but I want to use the theme for the whole site.

[20:11:29] <Palani> Can any one help me out
[20:23:34] <jtri> hello, and happy 4th (!) quick question about conflict between jquery and prototype, i have a javascript module i'm bringing in for a few pages on a site, it uses both and solves conflict on it's own with 'var $j = jQuery.noConflict();'
[20:23:59] <jtri> yet much of the site uses jquery as usual, '$'
[20:24:35] <jtri> I tried the easiest thing, which is just load it up and see what happens... I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object global] has no method 'on'" error
[20:24:48] <wad> Hi folks.
[20:24:57] <jtri> this is in the jquery library
[20:25:06] <jtri> any ideas? pointers?
[20:25:25] <jtri> wad: hi :)
[20:25:29] <wad> I'm trying to convert some non-jquery code to jquery, but I'm obviously missing something. Shouldn't these two lines do the same thing? var mapCanvas = document.getElementById("canvasMap"); var mapCanvas = $("#canvasMap");
[20:26:34] <jtri> they should as far as i know, are you getting different results?
[20:26:49] <jtri> i.e. you should only need one, i think
[20:27:04] <wad> Yeah, I've replaced the first with the second, but now I get errors. -_-
[20:27:13] <jtri> although, the jquery one might return a jquery wrapped object
[20:27:39] <wad> Ah!
[20:27:44] <wad> That's probably it.
[20:27:46] <jtri> you might need to "unpack" it somehow, just a hunch, b/c jquery returns a jquery
[20:27:59] <jtri> not sure how...though
[20:28:06] <wad> I don't think I need to unpack it, I just need to know the methods on it.
[20:28:11] <wad> so I can call them instead of the other ones.
[20:28:19] <wad> For example, I need to set the height and width.
[20:28:36] <jtri> i see, yeah, i think you're on the right track
[20:29:22] <wad> Hmm. Wonder what this is: http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/
[20:29:40] <CWSpear> a jQuery wrapper to draw to the canvas
[20:29:51] <CWSpear> or, if you will: "jCanvas is a jQuery plugin that makes
[20:29:51] <CWSpear> the HTML5 canvas easy to work with."
[20:30:37] <jtri> CWSpear, please read my question and offer a briliant answer!
[20:30:49] <CWSpear> I didn't see your question. Just logged on
[20:31:06] <jtri> quick question about conflict between jquery and prototype, i have a javascript module i'm bringing in for a few pages on a site, it uses both and solves conflict  on it's own with 'var $j = jQuery.noConflict();'
[20:31:20] <jtri> I tried the easiest thing, which is just load it up and see what happens... I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object global] has no method 'on'" error
[20:31:43] <CWSpear> what version of jQuery are you using?
[20:32:07] <jtri> the new project used 1.10, so i just switched to it
[20:32:10] * wad is back, reads up
[20:32:52] <wad> Is there no jquery support for HTML5's canvas? Ugh.
[20:33:15] <CWSpear> and you're using the $j you set up, or jQuery? What is the line generating the error?
[20:33:53] <jtri> well, there's too many lines in the existing project to make the $j adjustment (easily), so i was hoping for a magic way to avoid that
[20:33:59] <CWSpear> wad, canvas has a native JS API to interact with it. if you want to make it more jQuery-like, you can use that jcanvas plugin
[20:34:15] <wad> Ah, I see....
[20:34:18] <wad> That makes sense.
[20:34:20] <jtri> line 4 is generating the error
[20:34:23] <CWSpear> noConflict RELEASES the $
[20:34:55] <wad> So there's no need to try and make this piece of the code look more jQuery-ish.
[20:35:03] <wad> I can live with that! :)
[20:35:23] <CWSpear> you need to change the $ to $j or use prototype's noConflict… which I'm not so sure it does
[20:35:42] <CWSpear> not sure it has*
[20:35:56] <jtri> so since need prototype in the new pages, and thus need the $j no conflict, is there any way to make use the 'base template' which also loads/uses jquery?
[20:36:46] <CWSpear> I'm not sure I understood the question
[20:37:13] <CWSpear> but the issue (I'm guessing) is that $ is prototype, which is why you're getting that error.
[20:37:55] <jtri> I have added a couple new pages to a site, which rely on *both* jquery and prototype, so they use no-conflict version through $j, but other elements of the page which load (navigation) use jquery as is, through $
[20:37:59] <CWSpear> can you not open the files that have jQuery in them and replace $ with jQuery or $j?
[20:38:16] <CWSpear> or
[20:38:41] <jtri> there are 91 such files :(
[20:38:47] <CWSpear> you can wrap any jQuery code in (function($) { … })(jQuery);
[20:39:13] <CWSpear> if you wrap all the code in that, it makes the code in that function (the "…") able to use $ as jQuery
[20:39:25] <CWSpear> does that make any sense?
[20:39:48] <jtri> yes, but i'm afraid that both solutions are arduous
[20:40:02] <CWSpear> well, should have planned better?
[20:40:15] <CWSpear> why are you all of a sudden needing prototype?
[20:40:32] <jtri> it's stupid to use jquery without no-conflict, i guess, but if you use a number of third party libraries that do so, you easily run into this, no?
[20:40:35] <CWSpear> and why the heck do you have NINETY-ONE JS files?
[20:41:48] <CWSpear> Anyone that creates a third party plugin should either use jQuery or wrap it in a function like I showed you. If there's any chance you're writing jQuery that could be used with another library, you should use those techniques, too.
[20:42:03] <jtri> bringing in a new tool which uses prototype, and say 1/2 of the js files are in the django admin
[20:43:31] <CWSpear> If it's part of an established tool, I bet that those either use jQuery or wrap it in a function. And maybe you should find a different tool
[20:44:41] <jtri> perhaps your right, i've not looked through the files, just a grep in files to see how many js files have $ in them
[20:44:57] <jtri> so django for instance, must avoid using $ inappropriatly, no?
[20:45:02] <CWSpear> if it's easier, after the prototype code, you can set $ back to jQuery
[20:45:31] <CWSpear> I have never used django, but I would assume that it does
[20:45:56] <CWSpear> so like the last line that uses any prototype, set window.$ = window.jQuery
[20:46:04] <CWSpear> that may work
[20:46:55] <jtri> so what does the Uncaught TypeError: Object [object global] has no method 'on' mean?  it would be hard to do the setting back, b/c it's being used to manage dynamic creation of objects
[20:47:18] <jtri> oh, basically prototype stole $ and jquery is left hanging?
[20:47:55] <jtri> is there a way to rename for prototype, instead?
[20:48:03] <CWSpear> no, jQuery is still at jQuery
[20:48:32] <CWSpear> so that error: you have something like $('.selector').on
[20:48:52] <tw2113> and the $ is referencing prototype
[20:48:52] <jtri> so, if i just go ahead and make sure that all of "my" code uses jQuery, instead of $, and hope that any third party source worth anything did the same, i might get lucky?
[20:48:53] <CWSpear> well, normally $('.selector') returns a jQuery array-like object
[20:49:29] <CWSpear> but now it's referencing prototype and so $('.selector') is a prototype object which does NOT have an .on() method
[20:49:37] <jtri> then i can ignore the $j through no conflict? and just move that over to using jQuery
[20:49:57] <CWSpear> jtri, more or less
[20:50:06] <jtri> i see, the error makes sense now
[20:50:32] <jtri> the new project is small enough to sort through, so i'll switch it over to using jQuery, and make sure my code does the same
[20:54:25] <chaosrex> getter.php: http://pastebin.com/2PCXkuyG test.html: http://pastebin.com/nQQWii4t .. I have tried a couple of things but stuck on this one .. whenever a dropdown selection is made, getter.php is called to suggest relevant options for the remaining dropdown menus which are then passed back to test.html (its a dynamic form). Now this is the latest code I've tried to no avail, what I've done here
[20:54:25] <chaosrex> is that I have placed a submit button which is used to update the form ( I'll place onchange event for all the dropdowns later one so they update dynamically as per the changes ) .. Whenever I press the submit button, it simply throws me an empty dropdown menu instead of populating it with the newly arrived options ( via getter.php )
[20:58:34] <jtri> ok, so just for sanity, is bootstrap.js safely using jQuery, instead of $?
[21:00:21] <CWSpear> absolutely
[21:00:29] <jtri> it uses $ in the bootstrap.js file, but (I think) it is wrapping it... then
[21:00:42] <CWSpear> correct
[21:01:01] <jtri> ok, thanks, i'll look at how it does the wrapping for reference
[21:01:16] <tw2113> make it easy on yourself
[21:01:21] <tw2113> use functions like this to start out
[21:01:22] <tw2113> (function($) { /*code here */})(jQuery);
[21:01:29] <tw2113> that way you can use the beloved $
[21:01:34] <tw2113> without conflict
[21:01:36] <CWSpear> yeah. look at bootstrap.js. first line: function ($) {
[21:01:46] <CWSpear> last line: }(window.jQuery);
[21:02:01] <jtri> actually, they do a (bang) like this: !function ($) {
[21:02:06] <tw2113> if you're a document ready fan
[21:02:21] <tw2113> jQuery(document).ready(function($){ /* code here */ });
[21:02:39] <jtri> what's the ! in front for?
[21:02:51] <tw2113> ! usually indicates "not"
[21:03:01] <tw2113> so == is comparison for equality
[21:03:07] <tw2113> != is comparsion for inequality
[21:03:11] <jtri> rightio, but closures are confusing as it is
[21:03:28] <tw2113> ah you're seeing something in bootstrap.js
[21:03:30] <jtri> so !function ...
[21:03:44] <CWSpear> it's actually probably a hack to prevent an issue that can happen if you combine your scripts and you didn't do something right in a script you included before bootstrap
[21:03:47] <tw2113> my logic says that's checking for if the function doesn't exist?
[21:04:31] <CWSpear> generally you can use a ; instead of !, but I think some minifiers strip out that ;
[21:04:42] <jtri> so it keeps the browser from even reading the bootstrap code if the javascript syntax wasn't correct before that?, or something?
[21:05:32] <tw2113> i'll let CWSpear answer that one, i don't know
[21:05:46] <CWSpear> Ah, it's so it executes itself: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3755606/what-does-the-exclamation-mark-do-before-the-function
[21:05:48] <CWSpear> clever
[21:07:10] <CWSpear> jtri, I wouldn't worry if you didn't understand that. It doesn't have anything to do with what we're discussing about $ namespace conflict
[21:07:51] <jtri> I see: (function(){})(); is equivalent
[21:08:09] <jtri> right, i agree, but i find that slowing down to get things usually helps ;)
[21:08:19] <CWSpear> yes. and more readable. I wonder why they chose to save ONE byte at the expense of some readability?
[21:08:27] <tw2113> isn't javascript a lovely language
[21:08:32] <jtri> operator presidence, save a byte...yada yada
[21:09:27] <jtri> i sometimes wonder if I'll ever appreciate javascript for what must be an inner beauty
[21:10:33] <CWSpear> learn angular?
[21:12:47] <k_sze[work]> does jQuery 1.8 somehow not support selectors like 'input[type="submit"]' when used in IE8?
[21:15:56] <jtri> CWSpear: angular... interesting, i'm not sure I get the point though?  browsers run javascript, this is just another js library...is it just a 'better' jquery? another yet more comprehesive js library, i guess?
[21:16:23] <CWSpear> the DOM is where the magic is
[21:16:36] <CWSpear> the beauty, the elegance
[21:16:52] <CWSpear> and javascript lets us interact with it
[21:17:09] <horacsio> anyone to get paid for query?
[21:17:13] <horacsio> jquery?
[21:17:30] <tw2113> jtri, keep in mind that js is being run on servers now too
[21:17:33] <CWSpear> Libraries just give us a different way to interact with the DOM. To make things beautiful and to bring data and the view together
[21:18:09] <jtri> tw2113, please, stop!  I guess this is what I get for joining a js irc channel
[21:18:28] <tw2113> what? learning about the many uses of javascript?
[21:18:40] <tw2113> dom manipulation, MVC, server?
[21:19:04] <CWSpear> JS as a language is definitely quirky. But it's in a unique position that no other language is in.
[21:19:29] <CWSpear> So libraries embrace that and work to make it better
[21:19:32] <tw2113> universal implementation?
[21:19:39] <CWSpear> basically
[21:19:44] <jtri> i've been wondering when javascript will be replaced with something more python like, or for that matter why the browser requires the quirks...
[21:19:58] <CWSpear> nothing else can interact with the view
[21:20:08] <CWSpear> brython
[21:20:17] <jtri> but guessing that it won't, b/c it's soooooo embedded in the browser functionality
[21:20:25] <CWSpear> knock yourself out: http://www.brython.info/
[21:20:42] <tw2113> you'd get laughed at if you said js would make a comback a decade ago
[21:20:59] <tw2113> "what? that stuff used with dhtml? HAHAHAHAHA"
[21:22:43] <CWSpear> heading out
[21:22:53] <jtri> brython is just a js wrapper
[21:22:58] <jtri> thanks, later
[21:34:01] <chaosrex> any guesses?
[21:34:04] <chaosrex> getter.php: http://pastebin.com/2PCXkuyG test.html: http://pastebin.com/nQQWii4t .. I have tried a couple of things but stuck on this one .. whenever a dropdown selection is made, getter.php is called to suggest relevant options for the remaining dropdown menus which are then passed back to test.html (its a dynamic form). Now this is the latest code I've tried to no avail, what I've done here
[21:34:05] <chaosrex> is that I have placed a submit button which is used to update the form ( I'll place onchange event for all the dropdowns later one so they update dynamically as per the changes ) .. Whenever I press the submit button, it simply throws me an empty dropdown menu instead of populating it with the newly arrived options ( via getter.php )
[21:37:47] <jeremy--> I'm trying to get my table row id with: $(this).closest('tr').attr('id') it was returning undefined so i did a consolelog on the TR. I found that the id is shown as "" on the TR despite it showing as: <tr id="5"> in the source, any ideas?
[21:38:19] <jeremy--> table is dynamically generated with a ajax post then adding to the .html()
[21:38:47] <jeremy--> click handler is called with: .on()
[21:43:18] <jeremy--> nvm, i worked out that because my on() uses a table specificity handler, it returns at the table level, not the td level. thanks anyway if you read
[21:44:34] <horacsio> anyone at elance here?
[21:54:36] <wad> Why am I having such a hard time enabling a button that is disabled by default in the html?
[21:56:54] <jeremy--> $("input[type=submit]").removeAttr("disabled")
[21:56:56] <jeremy--> does that work
[21:57:05] <wad> I'll try that...
[21:57:45] <jeremy--> make sure you have jquery loaded, its in the appropriate event area, etc
[21:57:57] <wad> Hmm... I think it's because this button is being managed by jqueryui.
[21:58:15] * wad looks up the docs for that
[21:59:37] <jeremy--> if the button has 'disabled' in its tag, ie, <input type="blah" disabled>
[21:59:39] <wad> Yep, that was it!
[21:59:46] <wad> $buttonNewGame.button( "option", "disabled", false);
[21:59:48] <jeremy--> and you run that, and you view the code with inspector, you should see it go
[22:00:20] <wad> thanks
[22:28:32] <chaosrex> jeremy-- .. getter.php: http://pastebin.com/2PCXkuyG test.html: http://pastebin.com/nQQWii4t .. I have tried a couple of things but stuck on this one .. whenever a dropdown selection is made, getter.php is called to suggest relevant options for the remaining dropdown menus which are then passed back to test.html (its a dynamic form). Now this is the latest code I've tried to no avail, what I've
[22:28:32] <chaosrex> done here is that I have placed a submit button which is used to update the form ( I'll place onchange event for all the dropdowns later one so they update dynamically as per the changes ) .. Whenever I press the submit button, it simply throws me an empty dropdown menu instead of populating it with the newly arrived options ( via getter.php )
[22:31:03] <jeremy--> can you just ask the jquery question first, then if it requires it, i would check the source
[22:31:11] <jeremy--> What are you actually trying to do within the scope of jquery
[22:31:54] <jeremy--> EG. you want to perform x function on click
[22:33:00] <chaosrex> whenever someone hits Submit, I want to check the selected option for drop-down sides and based on that choice populate the drop-down colors with new options
[22:34:03] <chaosrex> so getter.php is being used to check logic (dumbed down for this sample) and jQuery to dynamically adjust options for drop-down menus as per the user choice, its a dynamic form
[22:34:31] <jeremy--> So you need to break the job up into tasks and learn about each one, because it sounds like you dont know where its not working
[22:35:18] <jeremy--> 1) make sure on change is working (google this), then console.log 2) make sure your ajax .post() is working and consolelog success {} to see it works, 3) look at the return data from the php handler and ECHO it or console.log again 4) do whatever you want with data
[22:35:37] <jeremy--> I'm not going to write your code randomly for you but if you wanted to you could work it out youself with those simple steps
[22:36:45] <chaosrex> okay .. i'll play around with it a bit more to see if it works
[22:38:18] <jeremy--> If you private messaged me asking why the select onchange isnt firing your PHP request, i would have responded with the correct way to do a jquery onchange, but people generally wont write your application for you
[22:39:52] <chaosrex> basically, onchange isn't the issue .. i am using the submit button right now for testing purposes and yet still its not working ...
[22:39:56] <chaosrex> i'll see what can be done
[22:40:45] <jeremy--> so you can use chrome, and go to the inspector, then look under NETWORK, and view the XHR request header and see that your select option is being sent to the php
[22:40:55] <jeremy--> thats step 2
[22:41:48] <chaosrex> i was using the JS console in chrome and it threw me an error, i fixed it .. i am more of a server side programmer than an interface guy so naturally i need to learn a lot about interfaces
[23:00:58] <Lianzinho> hey guys... if I call $('selector').click(functionName(arg1,arg2) which one will be the event, so that I can preventDefault on it? How do I call it ?
[23:01:22] <Cork> ?.click
[23:01:22] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[23:01:45] <Lianzinho> click
[23:02:05] <Cork> check the link...
[23:02:18] <Lianzinho> I know that, I mean... if I attach it to an anchor, I need to prevent the default, correct?
[23:03:00] <Cork> yes
[23:03:38] <Lianzinho> so, how do I call my named function so that I could prevent it AND send another argument to the function
[23:04:00] <Lianzinho> I don't know how to call it, what should represent the event
[23:04:11] <Cork> check the link
[23:04:16] <Cork> it is stated at the very top
[23:04:27] <Lianzinho> its the event data?
[23:06:14] <Lianzinho> but then how to use it? .click({data: "data"},namedFunction) ---function---> namedFunction(e) { e.preventDefault(); e.data}
[23:06:25] <Lianzinho> is that correct? e.data == "data" ?
[23:28:55] <Lianzinho> actually
[23:29:05] <Lianzinho> it would be e.data.data, hehehe
[23:29:21] <Lianzinho> chose a bad name
[23:29:26] <Lianzinho> anyway
[23:29:28] <Lianzinho> thanks
[23:43:52] <motox> I am using an .on('click') delgation for <li> items.  However, if a user Control+clicks it to open it in a new tab (or whatever the browsers hot-key is), it does not obey that preference.  Is there a way around this?
[23:45:47] <Cork> motox: if(event.ctrlKey) { return; }
[23:46:08] <motox> Cork> Each browser has a different hotkey though
[23:46:17] <motox> And on Mac it is Command
[23:46:29] <Cork> well only way is for you to check for it
[23:46:52] <motox> ok.  I guess I could just check for control and command.  That would cover at least 99% of them.
[23:47:07] <Cork> you can check for the metaKey for mac
[23:47:20] <Cork> motox: if(event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey) { return; }
[23:47:49] <motox> ok, thanks!
[23:48:13] <Cork> that will cover something like 110% though, but i think that is acceptable
[23:48:22] <Cork> (metaKey isn't only the mac command key)
[23:48:58] <Cork> for example i have a "Alt Gr" key and it is the metaKey for my language
[23:50:58] <motox> Cork> I think if I trap all of them that should be good.  Then it will let the browser handle it in its default method
[23:51:08] <motox> So metaKey should be perfect
[23:51:33] <Cork> ya, that is kinda what i meant before
[23:51:52] <Cork> overshooting is better then undershooting in this case
[23:52:17] <motox> yeah.  If the user is holding a key and clicking, they obviously want to do something :)
[23:54:15] <motox> Cork> That worked perfect, thanks!
