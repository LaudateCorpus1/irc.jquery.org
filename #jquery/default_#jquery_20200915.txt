[04:03:37] <ThoMe> hiho. I use $.when(myFunction()).done(function (respone) { ... my success code }).fail(function (respone) { my error code }); myFunction is an Ajax request. is it possible outside of the
[04:04:28] <ThoMe> $.when statement to wait, no matter if success or error ?
[04:04:34] <Cork> ThoMe: i would recommend moving the example code to a jsfiddle and make the lines shorter
[04:04:55] <Cork> forever lines just makes them hard to read
[04:05:17] <ThoMe> I use console.log("Done") but it runs even if $ when is not finished yet
[05:49:00] <Ruchi> Hi Team
[05:49:32] <Ruchi> I am upgrading the Jquery version from 1.4.4.1 to 3.3.1 in my live project
[05:50:35] <Ruchi> But I am not able to find the related jquery-3.3.1-vsdoc.js file to download
[05:51:55] <Ruchi> Upgrading Project from VS2010 to VS 2019 with framework 4.7
[05:53:26] <Ruchi> There is no jquery-3.3.1-vsdoc.js file available to download on jQuery.com
[06:11:33] <Cork> Ruchi: don't think jquery has every provided a vdoc js file
[06:24:30] <Ruchi> So do we need to use it with upgraded version of Jquery or not?
[06:47:07] <Cork> Ruchi: donno as i've never seen the file
[06:47:33] <Cork> prob a better question for a vs2010 channel/forum
[06:48:14] <Cork> i suspect it is an integration file for .net or something, but only guessing
[06:50:39] <Cork> Ruchi: googling around a bit it looks like it might be this project https://github.com/appendto/jquery-vsdoc
[06:50:56] <Cork> if you need it or not is up to you
[07:11:24] <Ruchi> okies thank you so much
[13:51:55] <Maxou> Hello trying to change this element to checked with a js method https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/temp/2502652?action=prism_export // Custom Switch
[13:51:55] <Maxou> a click event ?
[13:52:47] <robertmaxrees> Maxou you lost me haha
[13:52:58] <Maxou> :(
[13:53:00] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how to change it?
[13:53:09] <Maxou> I try to reset it
[13:53:20] <Maxou> when my ajax call is in error
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want .prop('checked') probably.
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> so .prop('checked', false);
[13:54:21] <Maxou> I m confuse about difference with attr
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 you want .prop() instead of .attr(), since you want to interact with the DOM directly.
[13:55:53] <Maxou> ibn both case it add checked attribut on element
[13:56:01] <Maxou> but view is same :/
[13:56:04] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause if I do $('#customSwitch2').prop('checked', true); in the js tab that snippet tool, it works.
[13:59:23] <Maxou> oh
[13:59:29] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:59:37] <Maxou> I try wait ;)
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> what were you trying to do before?
[14:00:39] <Maxou> $('#customSwitch2').prop('checked', true);20:00:45.983 VM1967:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'prop' of null    at <anonymous>:1:20
[14:01:04] <robertmaxrees> Maxou to $.fn.jquery in the console on your site - what do you get?
[14:01:24] <Maxou> oh I try in console you said in js tab
[14:01:36] <robertmaxrees> wait huh?
[14:01:40] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting that error??
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> that paste service seems really janky.
[14:02:26] <robertmaxrees> https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/temp/2502748?action=prism_export seems to be working here, either way.
[14:04:09] <Maxou> but it dont view state of the switch
[14:04:15] <Maxou> on your exemple
[14:04:19] <Maxou> change$
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/gPjf002.png looks like it's changing the state here.
[14:06:20] <robertmaxrees> https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/temp/2502760?action=prism_export here it is with the toggle initially set to checked and then set to unchecked by the js: https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/temp/2502760?action=prism_export
[14:08:08] <Maxou> they are all to unchecked stat for me
[14:08:22] <Maxou> except screenshot :D
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> is it visually appearing the way you expect it to?
[14:09:05] <Maxou> yes if I change it initialy it's work
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> is there a bug still then?
[14:09:29] <Maxou> but in sucess part of a ajax call in a click event ?
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you just use that code inside the .then()
[14:09:53] <Maxou> well in the error part
[14:09:59] <robertmaxrees> .catch() then
[14:10:15] <robertmaxrees> .catch(function() { /* your code here */ });
[14:11:22] <Maxou> I tryed this : https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/jquery/temp/2502748
[14:11:47] <Maxou> but there is error dont like this live editor :D
[14:12:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any errors.
[14:12:13] <Maxou> Yes its not mine :/
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:12:29] <robertmaxrees> are you getting an error on your site?
[14:13:34] <Maxou> I m rly bad with the live editor :/
[14:13:46] <robertmaxrees> that live editor is bad.
[14:13:50] <robertmaxrees> so let's not use it any more.
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> are you still having issues on your website?
[14:14:20] <Maxou> Yes I try to reproduce my use case somewhere
[14:14:35] <robertmaxrees> what are you stuck on?
[14:17:25] <Maxou> give me 1 min I m doing a jsfidle
[14:18:22] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:22:41] <Maxou> ok it's working like a charm : https://jsfiddle.net/a3p0eq6f/5/
[14:22:43] <Maxou> thx you
[14:30:03] <robertmaxrees> btw you want .then() and .catch() instead of done and fail :)
[14:33:56] <goddard> anyone with experience in jquery
[14:34:01] <goddard> and fullcalendar
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> goddard if you have a question just ask :)
[14:34:16] <robertmaxrees> if somebodyu can help, they will.
[14:34:25] <goddard> i have this situation https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5825
[14:34:28] <goddard> trying to debug
[14:34:38] <goddard> its like the start time of the calendar changes
[14:35:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused.
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> where's the jquery?
[15:05:07] <Maxou> why then and catch instead done and error ? robertmaxrees
[15:05:41] <robertmaxrees> then and catch are what you use with promises.
[15:05:46] <robertmaxrees> done and error are jquery-specific.
[15:06:02] <Maxou> done and fail sry
[15:06:08] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah.
[15:06:10] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[15:06:26] <robertmaxrees> then and catch are how you do it for promises.
[15:06:53] <Maxou> Yes but if I user jquery I shoudl use the recommended way to do of the jquery doc for ajax
[15:07:03] <robertmaxrees> which is .then() and .catch()
[15:07:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:07:27] <Maxou> rly ? if I was using vanilla js for my call I would use it
[15:07:43] <robertmaxrees> you should use .then() and .catch() in both cases :)
[15:09:45] <Maxou> this is rly confuse : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5436327/jquery-deferreds-and-promises-then-vs-done
[15:10:01] <robertmaxrees> that's also old info.
[15:10:05] <robertmaxrees> deferreds are promises.
[15:10:15] <robertmaxrees> use .then() and .catch()
[15:10:17] <robertmaxrees> done.
[15:12:26] <beatryder> .done()
[15:12:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:27:37] <kittonian> hi all. i am trying to get a custom validator to work with Parsley JS and cannot figure this one out. I created a jsfiddle with explanations and another custom validator that works on select elements from another page I have. https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/v9w8rgeb/
[18:28:41] <robertmaxrees> kittonian can you clarify where specifically oyu're having issues?
[18:30:21] <robertmaxrees> kittonian also: your fiddle seems to have a lot of extra stuff in it.  can you pare it down to just the code you're having issues with?  instead of "here's code that works vs code that doesn't"? :)
[18:34:54] <kittonian> robertmaxrees, there's an in depth explanation of how I need the custom validator to work on that page and there is no extra code, just an example
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> lol alright well that example is done oddly.
[18:37:23] <robertmaxrees> either way, sounds like you want validateMultiple maybe?
[18:38:27] <kittonian> validatemultiple does not work on select lists in this manner as far as I know
[18:39:03] <kittonian> and that example works perfectly on my other page. it's exactly what I needed to accomplish. i just need it modified for this solution.
[18:39:04] <robertmaxrees> why not check to see what gets passed to that callback?
[18:39:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying that other solution wouldn't function, just goes about it a weird way, that's all :)  either way, can you get this fiddle actually working so it first the validationa nd whatnot?
[18:40:11] <kittonian> the fiddle is perfect
[18:40:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the validation for?
[18:40:48] <robertmaxrees> *fire
[18:41:20] <kittonian> that's because it is not the correct validation script right now
[18:41:29] <kittonian> so it's not validating what it needs to
[18:41:50] <kittonian> and it fires just fine because if you look at the source you will see a novalidate="" on the form element
[18:41:56] <kittonian> that means parsley is engaged on the form
[18:41:57] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jn2qd49z/9/
[18:42:06] <robertmaxrees> when should I see those values get logged?
[18:42:57] <kittonian> i don't know what you're talking about
[18:43:27] <robertmaxrees> i've added a console.log() to the 'validateMultiple' callback - trying to see when that gets fired.
[18:43:28] <kittonian> the validator has to be modified to do what I need it to do for this page
[18:43:57] <kittonian> it is not validating anything to do with this page right now, except that I modified the name of the select, form, and class
[18:44:02] <kittonian> and put in the correct error msg
[18:44:14] <kittonian> otherwise, it's not checking t or f
[18:44:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you have a few things to do to get it to work.  also seeing the id ont he selects repeated.  hrm.
[18:44:30] <kittonian> that validator is for an entirely different purpose but deals with select boxes
[18:44:45] <kittonian> the id on the selects should be repeated
[18:44:53] <robertmaxrees> that is invalid html :)
[18:45:18] <kittonian> ok, then I can number them each differently
[18:45:37] <kittonian> regardless, the point of the question is help with writing the custom validator to do what I need it to do
[18:46:06] <robertmaxrees> sure - i'm trying to do that.  because this is a jquery support channel and not a parsley support channel, you gotta help us help you :)
[18:46:15] <robertmaxrees> hence the questions about basics like "when does the validation fire?"
[18:46:25] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'm flying completely blind.
[18:46:36] <kittonian> updated: https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/v9w8rgeb/
[18:47:04] <kittonian> with parsley the validation fires on submit
[18:47:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  even if I manually set those two callbacks to return false it still submits.
[18:47:44] <kittonian> but you'll notice that with the example code, once the validation fires and errors, I can change the values to get it to validate before hitting submit again
[18:48:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the errors yhou're mentioning :/
[18:48:14] <kittonian> perhaps this will help. https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/jObmEBN
[18:48:27] <kittonian> try setting two or more selects to the same number and then submit the form
[18:48:42] <kittonian> then, change the selects to not be the same and you'll see realtime validation
[18:49:15] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  is this the original example that works?
[18:49:48] <robertmaxrees> the one you were referencing before, I mean.
[18:51:01] <kittonian> yes, that is another page of mine where I needed a different validation on select boxes
[18:51:32] <kittonian> including that example code in the fiddle was just a way of giving someone who is helping me a starting point
[18:52:08] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  the original working example in total would've been much more helpful :)
[18:52:10] <robertmaxrees> thank youy!
[18:52:12] <robertmaxrees> *you
[18:52:30] <kittonian> and the commented out js code is something someone who tried to help wrote and it works, but not with parsley, only as raw js with a popup alert and that is not what I need
[18:52:46] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[18:54:55] <robertmaxrees> i would guess that's partially because that addValidator syntax is incorrect :)
[18:56:03] <kittonian> correct. that was me trying to modify the solution to work with parsley
[18:56:16] <robertmaxrees> ah, so the example wasn't actually ever functioning.
[18:56:23] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  sorry, was super confused for a sec.
[18:56:57] <kittonian> this is the functioning one but not with parsley
[18:56:57] <kittonian> https://bpa.st/raw/BTBA
[18:57:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:57:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm well.
[18:57:24] <robertmaxrees> that does use parsley haha.
[18:57:30] <robertmaxrees> but i'm guess not the way you'd like it do?
[18:57:47] <kittonian> correct
[18:58:00] <kittonian> i want this to work exactly the same way as the codepen example
[18:58:21] <kittonian> i want it to show the error message on all selects set to No if there are less than 5 set to Yes
[18:58:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so a few things: why not start with copying the codepen code over and updating all the selects?
[18:58:36] <kittonian> and I need to be able to change those selects to validate the form without resubmitting
[18:58:40] <robertmaxrees> *selectors.
[18:58:49] <kittonian> i literally did that
[18:59:01] <kittonian> but it's checking for something completely different
[18:59:08] <robertmaxrees> hrm./
[18:59:19] <robertmaxrees> i would think that it would throw validation errors int hat case.
[18:59:24] <kittonian> nope
[18:59:27] <kittonian> that's not how it works
[18:59:39] <kittonian> why would it throw an error if there's nothing to validate
[18:59:53] <kittonian> there are no duplicate numbers
[18:59:58] <kittonian> there are no numbers at all
[19:00:05] <kittonian> so it wouldn't error
[19:00:08] <robertmaxrees> sorry, that validateString is... confusing haha
[19:00:12] <robertmaxrees> nexted for loops and the like.
[19:00:26] <robertmaxrees> you sound liek you know what the specific issue is?
[19:00:44] <kittonian> i know what I need it to do, but i do not know how to write the code to do it
[19:01:13] <robertmaxrees> got it.  do you understand what any of the code in the validateString method is doing?
[19:05:44] <kittonian> I updated with better instructions https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/v9w8rgeb/
[19:06:06] <kittonian> and to answer your question, sort of but someone else wrote that for me a while ago
[19:06:13] <robertmaxrees> okay...
[19:06:19] <robertmaxrees> did you have plans to figure that out?
[19:06:28] <robertmaxrees> or are you just expecting somebody to "show you" how to do this?
[19:06:29] <kittonian> i was really just looking for some help
[19:08:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, trying to provide that by figuring out what sorta baseline we're on :)
[19:18:24] <robertmaxrees> kittonian ^
[19:19:37] <kittonian> i read that. not sure what I am supposed to say
[19:19:52] <robertmaxrees> how are you expecting to recieve help? :)
[19:20:24] <kittonian> like I said, i'm looking for some help. I understand the basics of what the code is doing but I'm not a js coder that could write it on my own
[19:20:37] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting somebody to write it for you?
[19:20:44] <kittonian> ok, thanks anyway
[19:20:52] <robertmaxrees> it's an honest question.
[19:20:54] <robertmaxrees> but okie :)
[19:20:57] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[19:21:00] <kittonian> the answer is yes
[19:21:07] <kittonian> i'm hoping someone will be kind and help me here
[19:21:23] <kittonian> just like when I know the answer I am kind and help them
[19:21:54] <kittonian> but I have now spent an hour answering all of your questions, modifying the fiddle, showing you examples, and have received 0 assistance
[19:21:55] <robertmaxrees> :/ yeah, sorry, but that's not really how these various IRC channels work.  "be kind" turns into repeated cases of doing free work, which doesn't end well.
[19:22:02] <kittonian> so I can't keep going back and forth with you
[19:22:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:22:10] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[19:22:18] <kittonian> there are plenty of people I know on IRC that provide help when needed
[19:22:23] <kittonian> if you're not one of them, fine
[19:22:30] <kittonian> but it's not cool to waste people's time like this
[19:22:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm glad you've found people who do free work for you :)
[19:22:47] <robertmaxrees> it's not cool to devalue somebody else's expertiese :) sorry!  best of luck though :)
[19:24:09] * kittonian notes that you shouldn't be on IRC responding to people's help requests if you're looking for paid work. There are plenty of gig websites for you to post on.
[19:24:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm here to provide free assistance :)
[19:24:33] <robertmaxrees> and help you learn how to solve problems yourself.
[19:25:15] <kittonian> well so far you haven't provided any assistance
[19:25:36] <robertmaxrees> because i'm trying to gain context on a completely unrelated validation library :)
[19:25:54] <kittonian> in fact, with a ridiculously informative fiddle and starter code provided, along with a working example but not the way I need it to work, your first response was for my to explain it all again
[19:26:07] <kittonian> unrelated? parsley depends on jquery
[19:26:18] <kittonian> it's directly related to both javascript and jquery
[19:26:34] <robertmaxrees> it's become very clear that you have no interest in actively learning how to solve this problem yourself :/
[19:26:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry for "wasting your time".
[20:25:14] <snackoverflow> how can i allow a user to use their mouse pointer to select an area of a canvas, with it returning x1,y1,x2,y2?
[20:33:19] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow jquery isn't really compatible with canvas last i checked.
[20:38:23] <robertmaxrees> would be more likely to get help in ##javascript :)
