[03:21:15] <harry_> hi all
[03:27:14] <harry_> hey
[03:28:11] <AdamPDotty> hay is for horses
[03:36:21] <undefined_bob> you wrote horse and all I can think about now is wurst
[04:59:24] <aLeSD> hi all
[04:59:33] <aLeSD> is this aq good place to ask for axios ?
[05:00:40] <thykka> does it have anything to do with jQuery?
[05:03:42] <aLeSD> good question
[08:43:21] <shadowswalker> hello guys,
[08:44:26] <shadowswalker> I have to toggle result's body with click event on result's head, I have fetched data using ajax and looping through data to create html element but don't know how to handle the click event to toggle the body when head is clicked ??
[08:45:30] <Cork> shadowswalker: is the header in proximity of the body of the message?
[08:45:52] <Cork> (basically it is prob better to make a jsfiddle showing the problem)
[08:46:56] <shadowswalker> <div class="result"><div class="result-header"></div><div class="result-body"></div></div>
[08:47:12] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/
[08:48:02] <shadowswalker> It's basically same for all the results, so I have assigned click event for class $(".class").on('click', '.result-header', function(){}) but how to access result-body
[08:49:00] <thykka> within the handler: $(this).next('.result-body') ?
[08:49:09] <preference> so you have a head, then a body. you want to change something in the body when the head is clicked?
[08:49:35] <thykka> oh right, it's a delegate target
[08:49:44] <shadowswalker> preference: just toggle
[08:50:51] <thykka> then it's $(event.delegateTarget).next('.result-header') I think
[08:51:07] <thykka> ..provided you have 'event' set as the handler's first argument
[08:59:21] <shadowswalker> thykka: how can I attach a event handler to '.result-header' ? to toggle '.result-body' ??
[09:00:21] <shadowswalker> $('.result-header').on('click', function(){ ... });
[09:01:18] <thykka> I already told you :P
[09:01:27] <shadowswalker> how ?
[09:01:32] <thykka> please read above
[09:02:28] <shadowswalker> $(this).next('.result-body').toggle(); works for some but doesnot work for some result on the same page
[09:03:12] <thykka> then there's something else going on
[09:03:27] <shadowswalker> $(event.delegateTarget).next('.result-header').toggle() has same problem working with some div.result-header not with some..
[09:03:31] <thykka> impossible to tell without seeing it in action
[09:04:21] <thykka> but I'm guessing you've typoed some of the classnames, or something similar
[09:05:49] <preference> can someone tell me the syntax for the commands like defining a word?
[09:05:55] <preference> or where i can find said syntax?
[09:06:00] <preference> woops, wrong chat!
[09:10:29] <shadowswalker> thykka: the click event is called (prints log message inside function(){}) for every header clicked, but only works for first, third, fifth element, not second and fourth ( I have five on testing)
[09:10:52] <thykka> yeah, well I can't see any of your elements. What do you expect me to do? :P
[09:11:16] <thykka> one does not simply remotely debug without an address
[09:16:21] <TotallyNotKim> hey, any idea how I could wait for the value in a number input to "settle" before doing something? This is a webapp optimized for touch, so some value will be increased by 1 each after touching a big arrow
[09:16:52] <TotallyNotKim> I want to wait for the value to be the same for like 1 sec before firing an api call
[09:16:59] <Cork> TotallyNotKim: you have two options the input event or the change event
[09:17:08] <Cork> there isn't really another option
[09:17:21] <thykka> TotallyNotKim, seems like you're looking for a debounced function
[09:17:55] <TotallyNotKim> ah debounce
[09:17:56] <thykka> TotallyNotKim, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[09:17:58] <TotallyNotKim> nice keyword
[09:18:00] <TotallyNotKim> ty
[09:18:36] <TotallyNotKim> you know, when you know what you're looking for, but dont know how to feed it to google to get the right results? haha
[09:19:27] <thykka> ;)
[09:20:51] <TotallyNotKim> this is perfect. You saved me an hour or two. Thanks
[10:34:12] <catbadger> hey.
[10:34:30] <catbadger> anyone know the release cycle for twbs?
[10:35:04] <catbadger> anyone know the release cycle for twitter bootstrap?
[10:36:46] <Cork> catbadger: => ##bootstrap
[10:40:09] <catbadger> ty
[11:48:29] <armlesshobo> ran my code through Uglify for the first time ever, and it told me that my code is ugly enough and that I'm a little bitch
[11:48:32] <armlesshobo> who do I sue?
[14:50:24] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:50:46] <taplar> bon'jour
[14:54:44] <Azrael_-> i have an a-href-text-link and connected attached to the mouseenter+mouseleave-events. i want to display a picture at the position of the mouse where it enters the area of the link. in former times it worked like a charm but currently the mouseenter+mouseleave-events happen all the time nearly instant without ever ending. any idea how i could fix this?
[14:56:42] <taplar> can you show us an example of the issue?
[14:56:48] <Azrael_-> just trying to set up one
[15:01:03] <Azrael_-> https://jsfiddle.net/5u6gaeL6/ this works in my jsfiddle just fine. but in my internal site it just flickers between both states without really showing
[15:02:11] <Azrael_-> any idea why this couldn't be static?
[15:02:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:03:51] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- i might know the issue
[15:03:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5u6gaeL6/1/
[15:03:59] <robertmaxrees> try adding that margin-left: 15px; in your site.
[15:04:51] <Azrael_-> ok, one second
[15:06:45] <Azrael_-> thank you, godlike!
[15:06:52] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:06:56] <robertmaxrees> question for you
[15:06:58] <Azrael_-> i can't believe why it stopped working now. can you enlighten me?
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> basically, when the image was showing, the corner was under the cursor.
[15:07:27] <robertmaxrees> so the mouseleave would fire.
[15:08:08] <Azrael_-> yeah, that's what i figured from your response. i'm just curious why it worked until now and now stopped in ff
[15:08:25] <robertmaxrees> could be all kinds of things that changed your styles.
[15:08:36] <Azrael_-> didn't touch that site for ages
[15:08:37] <robertmaxrees> i would probably set the top and left to the element and not the cursor.
[15:08:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, add a few px to the x and y coords
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> browser updates can have an impact too.
[15:09:50] <Azrael_-> that's probably it. thanks again for your help
[15:11:12] <robertmaxrees> might also check to make sure you aren't including any libs using a "latest" cdn style setup.
[15:11:18] <robertmaxrees> or in your package.json.
[15:11:41] <Azrael_-> no, everything local
[15:12:06] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) might be worth checking your network tab just in case :)
[15:30:08] <Azrael_-> checked it: everything local :)
[15:30:24] <Azrael_-> the only think i could imagine would be this changed behaviour due to the browser updates
[18:33:02] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:33:12] <taplar> aloha
[18:33:34] <gambl0re> im trying to serialize data but it isnt working
[18:33:55] <taplar> are the inputs disabled or missing a name attribute?
[18:34:26] <gambl0re> they all have name attributes
[18:48:48] <gambl0re> any ideas?
[18:49:37] <robertmaxrees> share your code?
[18:49:44] <robertmaxrees> otherwise there's no way for us to know.
[18:50:27] <taplar> and they're not disabled?
[18:50:36] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[18:50:51] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re if you don't share your code, there's no way for us to help.  sorry duder.
[18:50:51] <gambl0re> i cant share the code, its work related.
[18:51:05] <gambl0re> what else can i do
[18:51:07] <robertmaxrees> you can share an isolated test case.
[18:51:10] <gambl0re> how
[18:51:11] <robertmaxrees> make it generic.
[18:51:15] <gambl0re> how do i do that
[18:51:23] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle and show us the basics of what you're trying to do.
[18:51:40] <gambl0re> no worries
[18:52:51] <gambl0re> im trying to do serialze but its not console logging the values
[18:52:54] <gambl0re> input values
[18:53:14] <robertmaxrees> is it in an event handler or something?
[18:53:17] <robertmaxrees> are you targeting the right element?
[18:53:25] <gambl0re> ya
[18:53:42] <robertmaxrees> and the inputs aren't disabled?
[18:53:50] <gambl0re> why would they be disabled?
[18:53:55] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:54:02] <robertmaxrees> literally no way for us to know what your codde looks like.
[18:54:08] <taplar> that's just one of the two conditionals that would cause things not to serialize
[18:54:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:54:32] <robertmaxrees> since you won't give us code, there's not really much we can do but ask about basics.
[18:55:00] <gambl0re> what do you mean i wont give you code? i cant show you the code.
[18:55:12] <robertmaxrees> you can show us a test case.
[18:55:31] <gambl0re> nevermind
[18:58:39] <robertmaxrees> taplar you do much more with service workers yet?
[18:59:45] <taplar> not yet.  i put a readme on the shell project so it's more friendly, but other than that I've been trying to figure out an icon so i can make a manifest file
[19:00:07] <robertmaxrees> you could always just scale up your current favicon for it.
[19:00:15] <taplar> i don't have one, :)
[19:00:19] <robertmaxrees> hah
[19:01:36] <taplar> but i was also doing a lot of angular stuff around the time that i was redoing the hiddenworld part onto the github site, so most of that time I was going home and not wanting to touch javascript.  still on the cooldown a bit
[19:02:37] <robertmaxrees> hah.  don't blame you there ;)
