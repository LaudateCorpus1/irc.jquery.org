[00:11:44] * devi8 notices a tumbleweed rolling by, whistles
[04:54:47] <thomas_25> I have an image width height 243px, margin-bottom: 40px and it is contained in an <a>... a's computed height is 297px.. where does the added 14px come from?
[04:55:38] <thomas_25> aha line-height
[04:56:29] <Cork> ya, a classical problem
[04:56:52] <Cork> thomas_25: simplest solution is to change the img from display: inline to display: inline-block;
[04:57:22] <Cork> or was it the a tag... don't remember >_<
[06:32:48] <devi8> Why does this formula only work in one direction? https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/RQQxPv
[06:33:47] <devi8> I'm trying to create an easing method that relates to the scroll position...so that the animation goes from 0 (at scrollTop=0) to 1 (at scrollTop=scrollHeight)..
[06:34:42] <devi8> I figured I could use robert pennier's easing formulas and substitute scroll position for time
[07:17:07] <AdamPDotty> and gone
[07:17:26] * AdamPDotty guesses it was line 35
[08:00:33] <fas3r> hello
[08:29:13] <AdamPDotty> devi8: checked line 35 yet?
[08:59:09] <devi8> AdamPDotty, thanks for checking.. I got it worked out now but it's so choppy. I am going to try the requestAnimationFrame method next. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
[09:00:55] <AdamPDotty> yep, felt jumpy. Not sure, what to do about it.
[09:03:43] <devi8> I saw this great website that had a 3D model of a product that came apart in an exploded view, but it worked with scrolling. So as you scrolled down, the machine came together. Scrolling up it pulled apart. It was brilliant
[09:07:02] <AdamPDotty> well, you got at least two steps in that direction :-)
[10:29:41] <TomyWork> hi
[10:31:03] <TomyWork> I want to fetch a piece of text via http and display it as a native tooltip. I don't want to fetch anything before the user hovers their mouse over the element for 1s.
[10:31:38] <TomyWork> i have the fetching done and i set the tooltip using .attr()
[10:32:10] <TomyWork> however, it only shows up if i move my mouse out an in again
[10:32:18] <TomyWork> and*
[10:32:34] <thykka> you're setting the .attr() within the ajax callback?
[10:32:39] <TomyWork> yes
[10:32:46] <thykka> and the callback gets the value?
[10:35:31] <devi8> could you manually trigger the mouseout event and mouseover event so it happens quickly?
[10:36:04] <thykka> also, are you caching the result, or fetching it again on each mouseover?
[12:19:33] <z1haze> if a jquery plugin has a click event, and I want to just disable that click event, shouldn't i be able to do a e.stopImmediatePropagation in my own listener?
[12:29:16] <taplar> looks like it
[12:30:47] <z1haze> ive done some real hackery to get this datepicker to work inline this working - they are refusing to let this one go
[12:59:37] <Whiskey> is there anyway to get tinyurl work whit jquery?
[13:01:56] <thykka>  Whiskey define "work with"
[13:02:51] <Whiskey> php file_get_contents what would be equal in jQuery?
[13:03:32] <TomyWork> thykka sorry, earlier, i had to leave unexpectedly. yes, the callback seems to get the value. if i move the mouse over a 2nd time, the title tooltip appears with what I expect as the result of that GET request
[13:04:03] <thykka> Whiskey, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[13:05:03] <TomyWork> i'm using jquery.get, which claims to be a wrapper
[13:05:04] <TomyWork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[13:05:20] <TomyWork> oops, you were responding to Whiskey :D
[13:06:09] <Whiskey> get is what i search after i think
[13:06:09] <thykka> TomyWork, I would go over the code with a step debugger and see where the unexpected happens
[13:06:10] <Whiskey> thanks
[13:10:05] <TomyWork> thykka nothing unexpected happens
[13:10:21] <z1haze> @taplar, so what we ended up doing with that datepicker thing, I had to override the default css for the current day, then in the onSelect option, pass a function to shift the min date by 1, so it would look/function like nothing was selected by default
[13:10:29] <TomyWork> the browser just doesnt show a tooltip for a title that doesnt exist yet
[13:10:57] <TomyWork> so i need to force it to show the tooltip after the fact
[13:11:00] <taplar> huh
[13:11:05] <TomyWork> probably not possible, right?
[13:11:28] <thykka> TomyWork, oh, right
[13:11:29] <thykka> ic
[13:12:00] <thykka> can you initialize it with an empty title before any user interaction takes place? and if you can, does it help?
[13:12:11] <TomyWork> hmm lemme try
[13:14:36] <TomyWork> thykka doesn't solve the problem :/
[13:14:41] <thykka> darn
[13:15:07] <TomyWork> anyway, i gotta run
[13:15:46] <Whiskey> i try to do "$.get( "https://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=testt", function( data ) {alert( "Load was performed." + data );});" but that seems to not be working out very well
[13:15:59] <Whiskey> thinked data would contain the tinyurl
[13:16:41] <TomyWork> Whiskey 2nd parameter is not the success function
[13:17:08] <TomyWork> Whiskey put null as the 2nd parameter and try that
[13:17:13] <TomyWork> i'm out, see ya
[13:17:43] <Whiskey> hmm?
[13:18:18] <thykka> TomyWork, all of these work for me. The third one only breaks if the delay is larger than the tooltip delay https://jsfiddle.net/s1d1pgnc/2/
[13:18:35] <thykka> so either the request simply doesn't complete in time, or there's something else going on
[13:18:51] <TomyWork> thykka yeah problem is the server is slow ^^
[13:19:14] <TomyWork> anyway, out
[13:19:20] <TomyWork> thanks for the help
[13:19:20] <thykka> have a blast
[13:21:17] <Whiskey> get error on whatever i do :D
[15:56:17] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[17:26:53] <mrush> can .forEach, or some other plain javascript iterator, give me some_array.forEach((index,value) => {}) ? or should i just use $.each()
[17:27:13] <mrush> my goal here is to have access to both the value _and the index_
[17:27:47] <taplar> both $.each and forEach pass in the value and index
[17:27:53] <taplar> they are just in reverse order for each other
[17:28:02] <mrush> taplar: okay cool, thanks
[17:36:32] <Whiskey> $('#tinyurl').attr('title', id); <- how do i get that tile its a link in id
[17:36:46] <Whiskey> but it seems like it not convert the link to text
