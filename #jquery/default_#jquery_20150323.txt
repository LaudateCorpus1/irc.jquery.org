[01:50:31] <frank_o> Can anyone tell why `xhr.getResponseHeader('Last-Modified')` returns null? I checked in dev tools and `Last-Modified` does indeed exist. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4111b9d0ce48ae5a8931
[01:57:32] <Cork> frank_o: you used the arguments in the wrong order
[01:57:40] <Cork> frank_o: xhr isn't the second argument

[01:59:17] <frank_o> hmmm
[02:01:40] <frank_o> Cork: thank you _so_ much was driving me crazy =)

[03:08:07] <jonkristian> Anyone using dropzone for fileuploads? Is it so that when uploading multiple files the upload_max_filesize needs to be calculated for 4 files at a time, I have it set to 15MB and was uploading two files that were 10MB and 8MB each and it failed.
[03:13:57] <Xatenev> Heya
[03:14:20] <Xatenev> a fast question: when im using $.ajax, how can i write a variable name with [] in the data tab?
[03:14:42] <Xatenev> Example: $.ajax({ data: { someExample[text]: value })...
[03:14:53] <Xatenev> it doesnt like the [text] here
[03:15:00] <Cork> Xatenev: you can't in es5
[03:15:07] <Cork> you have to create an object and update that
[03:15:10] <Cork> then use the object
[03:15:28] <Xatenev> so theres no way of calling my argument someValue[text] ?
[03:15:30] <Cork> var o = {}; o[text] = value; $.ajax({ data:o })
[03:15:47] <Cork> Xatenev: there is, just not that way
[03:15:49] <Xatenev> because my framework needs the key to be called myExtension[argumentName]
[03:16:06] <Cork> use the solution i just gave you
[03:16:07] <Xatenev> ah ok
[03:16:09] <Xatenev> yea i see
[03:16:09] <Xatenev> :)
[03:16:12] <Xatenev> trying
[03:18:23] <Xatenev> Cork: and how do i get a mix of key vlaue AND the object
[03:18:25] <Xatenev> for example:
[03:18:39] <Xatenev> data : { key: 'val', myObject } ?
[03:18:46] <Cork> concating the string?
[03:18:51] <Cork> just like any string
[03:18:59] <Cork> ah
[03:19:07] <Cork> and the object?
[03:19:11] <Cork> not sure what you eman
[03:19:13] <Cork> *mean
[03:19:24] <Xatenev> well in the end i wanna have 4 key value pairs
[03:19:28] <Xatenev> inside the $.ajax data
[03:19:36] <Cork> so define 4 keys
[03:19:39] <Cork> one per line
[03:19:41] <Xatenev> 3 of them from the object so i can name it like this: someValue[text]
[03:19:47] <Xatenev> and 1 just per key value
[03:20:02] <Xatenev> How do i do that now? .p
[03:20:03] <Cork> ?past @ Xatenev
[03:20:08] <Cork> ?paste @ Xatenev
[03:20:08] <b-ot> Xatenev: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:20:20] <Xatenev> on it sir :P

[03:20:59] <Xatenev> this is what i have just now
[03:21:30] <Xatenev> not working of course
[03:21:43] <Xatenev> where it says tx_intaktuser_pi2 i just wanna use all arguments of my object now
[03:21:43] <Xatenev> :)
[03:21:47] <Xatenev> u get me?
[03:22:51] <Xatenev> Or am I just telling weird stuff which makes no sense? :p
[03:22:59] <Cork> Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/e08787up/1/
[03:23:42] <Xatenev> hm
[03:23:47] <Xatenev> why the dot?
[03:23:54] <Xatenev> like tx_intaktuser_pi2.eID = 'intaktuserSaveFilteR'
[03:24:02] <Xatenev> wouldnt it be just eID = 'intaktuserSaveFilter' then?
[03:24:34] <Xatenev> or how does the dot work there?
[03:26:59] <Xatenev> hm its still not working - it sends an array like this: array(5) { "filter"] => instead of array(..) { tx_intaktuser_pi2 => array ( ' filter' =>
[03:28:05] <Xatenev> w/e idc now^^ i will just workaround it then

[03:45:30] <Katharsis> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ps4UfRBA why blocker isn't fadeout?
[03:48:35] <Cork> Katharsis: you never set it to hide() or fadeOut
[03:48:47] <Cork> Katharsis: also don't put element names infront of ids
[03:55:31] <chakkimatti> how to do animated scroll in jquery ? should this work? or should it be window or document? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/487e2c12bb7db635f69b
[04:03:10] <Cork> chakkimatti: it depends on the browser
[04:03:20] <Cork> sadly webcompat forces that
[04:03:39] <Cork> ie and firefox uses document.documentElement and webkit uses body
[04:04:18] <chakkimatti> Cork: oh
[04:04:20] <chakkimatti> thanks
[04:42:32] <Katharsis> how to download (force) file with jquery?
[04:44:42] <Xatenev> Katharsis: something like this probably: $('a#someID').attr({target: '_blank',                      href  : 'http://localhost/directory/file.pdf'});
[04:45:01] <Xatenev> if u click on the link #someID it will open a new window with the file download inside now
[04:46:13] <Katharsis> new windows is blocking
[04:48:18] <decx> either change the mimetype on your server or use the download attribute for links
[05:36:35] <cuppy> Hi, all - I'm picking apart WaitForImages.js. I'm having trouble finding specific documentation on JS's load event. I need to know when it fires: Somewhere *before* the entire file is downloaded, or immediately *after*.
[05:44:19] <Cork> cuppy: you would have to link the file if you want help
[05:45:19] <cuppy> Cork, https://github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages/blob/master/src/jquery.waitforimages.js
[05:45:56] <cuppy> Cork, what I'm trying to determine is if JS's load event is firing before the image is fully transferred from server to cache.
[05:46:51] <Cork> cuppy: line 172
[05:47:28] <Cork> it creates a new image element and binds a load event on it
[05:47:37] <Cork> and collects the handling
[05:47:57] <Cork> so if the image isn't in cache it will preload it
[05:48:04] <Cork> if it is in cache, it will detect that
[05:49:01] <cuppy> Cork, right. But again, I don't know what JS specifically means by "load". Does it mean the file is fully transferred to the HD, or only that its properties (dimensions, file size, et cetera) can be read?
[05:49:21] <Cork> cuppy: load means that the browser has the image in memory
[05:49:29] <Cork> read to draw
[05:52:02] <hollusion> i have a problem resetting the cursor. $('body, body *').css('cursor', 'progress'); $('body, body *').css('cursor', 'auto'); will assign the "default" cursor to <a> instead of "pointer"
[05:52:16] <hollusion> i thought it would revert to default behavior after setting "auto"
[05:52:50] <cuppy> Whoops ... of course, it goes to RAM first. Cork, I'm sorry for being so dense -- I'm going to ask this another way just one more time: Say I have a 100MB image. Will 'load' wait 4 mins before the entire image is transferred to physical memory(RAM and/or HD) before firing, or will load fire sometime before that?
[05:53:04] <hollusion> do i have to explicitly assign "cursor:pointer"? how can i revert to browser default?
[05:53:18] <callumacrae> Is it possible to resolve a jquery deferred object multiple times?
[05:53:59] <Cork> cuppy: load means the image is loaded and the browser is ready to draw the entire image
[05:54:19] <Cork> cuppy: lets put it this way if you insert an <img> tag with a load even and the image is 100mb
[05:54:27] <Cork> the load event fires when the last line in the image is drawn
[05:54:40] <cuppy> Cork, ah. Got it thx
[05:54:49] <cuppy> I appreciate your patience :)
[05:54:57] <Cork> hollusion: set ('cursor', '')
[05:57:54] <Cork> callumacrae: depends on how you initialized the object
[05:58:15] <callumacrae> I haven't, I'm exploring options :P basically I want a stream library, but they're all huge
[05:58:43] <Cork> callumacrae: deffered is normally persistent
[05:58:49] <Cork> but it can be a one time event too
[05:58:57] <Cork> depends on what option you choose to use
[05:59:06] <callumacrae> I'll test it out after lunch
[05:59:18] <silverdust> Why doesn't the other buttons besides the first work here http://jsfiddle.net/w5ag8arw/ ?
[05:59:18] <Cork> ah, shit sorry
[05:59:27] <Cork> callumacrae: yes, deferred can always fire multiple times
[05:59:35] <Cork> it is $.Callbacks that has the options
[06:00:13] <Cork> callumacrae: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/#supported-flags
[06:00:37] <callumacrae> Cork: basically this is what I'm trying to do https://gist.github.com/callumacrae/86f11378bebb31067d32
[06:00:56] <Cork> callumacrae: you most likely want callbacks and not deferred
[06:01:13] <Cork> deferred is only interesting if you can have failing/succeeding
[06:01:15] <callumacrae> I actually want a stream, but stream libraries are all huge :(
[06:04:44] <silverdust> Cork: Got something to say on this http://jsfiddle.net/w5ag8arw/ ?
[06:05:28] <Cork> you don't need $() around '#parent'
[06:05:30] <silverdust> Only the first one actually adds
[06:06:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/w5ag8arw/1/
[06:06:33] <Cork> also i would prob use insertAfter instead
[06:07:07] <Cork> silverdust: http://jsfiddle.net/w5ag8arw/2/
[06:07:42] <Cork> silverdust: also note that the selector in .parent() most likely doesn't do what you expect
[06:07:56] <Cork> silverdust: you most likely want .closest('.entry') instead
[06:08:19] <Cork> cause .parent('.entry') returns nothing unless the absolute parent is '.entry'
[06:08:42] <Cork> it doesn't search for the parent that matches (.closest does)
[06:09:21] <silverdust> That's true. Sounds better
[06:10:13] <silverdust> Thanks
[06:14:09] <forgotmynick> afternoon
[06:14:43] <Xatenev> Heya
[06:14:44] <Xatenev> fast question
[06:14:56] <Xatenev> can i tell my jquery ajax that it should start only if all previous ajax calls are DONE
[06:15:07] <Xatenev> so two dont get executed at the same time, but they are put into a queue?
[06:15:41] <Cork> Xatenev: you would have to call the ajax call from the done/complete of the previous call
[06:15:46] <Cork> so no nothing built in
[06:16:14] <Xatenev> fuck
[06:16:15] <Xatenev> :|
[06:16:26] <Xatenev> Because at the moment, if i click the onclick event ( which triggers the ajax) too fast
[06:16:30] <Xatenev> things get executed wrong
[06:16:41] <Xatenev> because its executed at the same time and works with session
[06:16:46] <Xatenev> and boom
[06:16:47] <Xatenev> :D
[06:18:03] <Cork> Xatenev: you could use a timer for starting the ajax call
[06:18:05] <jacquerie> Perhaps you can attach the event on the done callback?
[06:18:24] <Xatenev> Cork: more info? :O dont get it yet
[06:18:26] <Cork> and just clearing the timer if a click happens "too soon"
[06:18:48] <Cork> Xatenev: there are also queue plugins for jquery
[06:18:58] <Cork> where you can have it queue calls
[06:19:01] * Xatenev googles
[06:19:06] <Cork> ?g jquery.ajaxqueue
[06:19:06] <b-ot> Cork: gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue · GitHub → https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue
[06:33:52] <Xatenev> fixed
[06:33:57] <Xatenev> queue fixed the problem :]
[06:43:33] <Xatenev> Yoho
[06:43:35] <Xatenev> another question =)^^
[06:43:49] <Xatenev> Chrome got a problem with this line: checkboxesRegion[a].addEventListener('change', showCheckboxesCompanies);
[06:43:55] <Xatenev> which works just perfectly fine in mozilla firefox
[06:44:03] <Xatenev> "undefined is not a fnuction"
[06:44:20] <Xatenev> any idea on that? :P
[06:45:06] <Xatenev> Btw it seems to ONLY work in firefox
[06:45:13] <Xatenev> not working IE too :\
[06:47:39] <Cork> Xatenev: there is too little context there
[06:48:18] <Xatenev> Well theres just a for loop around it
[06:48:20] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: if you're using jquery, why are you using "addEventListener" ?
[06:48:20] <Cork> like 1. what are in the variables, 2. what browser version are you trying to do this in
[06:48:30] <Xatenev> NoiseEee: .bind() doesnt work too - same error
[06:48:45] <Xatenev> I tried both^^
[06:48:46] <Cork> Xatenev: ya, the values you loop doesn't exist
[06:48:49] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: you're going to have to pastebin some code
[06:48:52] <Cork> context, :)
[06:49:04] <Cork> and no no pastebin
[06:49:13] <Cork> use jsfiddle and reproduce the state you have problem with
[06:49:29] <Xatenev> Yea well, u just told me what the error is
[06:49:29] <Xatenev> =p
[06:49:34] * Xatenev checking
[06:50:26] <Cork> Xatenev: i didn't really, i just told you what the error message means with different wordings
[06:50:43] <Cork> why it doesn't exist can be cause of several reasons
[06:53:56] <Xatenev> Well it makes no sense though
[06:55:34] <NoiseEee> everything makes sense
[06:55:48] <NoiseEee> but since you haven't set up a decent way to investigate, it wont make sense until you do
[07:01:37] <hellier> yo someone mind taking a peep at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29212220/jquery-adding-a-setting-to-the-ajax-function ?
[07:09:16] <gnarf> hellier: two ways, first: you can use the global $(document).ajaxStart/ajaxComplete, but I suggest against that
[07:09:22] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to get Yii to work on a windows IIS install. I have the root directory pointed to the correct www directory, but when I go to the user /controller/action it gives me this error - The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.
[07:09:32] <Forbidd3n> so it is looking for the directory to exist
[07:10:02] <Cork> Forbidd3n: that isn't on topic for this channel
[07:10:23] <gnarf> hellier: you can also do something like function safeAjax(opts) { buttonDisable(); return $.ajax(opts).done(function() { buttonEnable(); }); });
[07:10:32] <gnarf> then convert all your $.ajax to use your ajax method
[07:10:34] <Forbidd3n> Cork: I am having trouble getting Yii install to work on Windows IIS, how is this not topic related?
[07:10:38] <gnarf> its much "safer" imo
[07:10:53] <ProofTechnique> Because Yii isn't jQuery
[07:10:57] <ProofTechnique> Forbidd3n:
[07:11:00] <Forbidd3n> Oh wrong channle sorry
[07:11:09] <Cork> -_-'
[07:11:17] <Xatenev> Forbidd3n: Rofl
[07:11:18] <Xatenev> :D
[07:11:27] <Xatenev> Cork, NoiseEee solved btw .)
[07:11:50] <Xatenev> with .bind() it works perfect, i just forgot to make it a jquery obj before
[07:11:59] <Xatenev> so .bind() wasnt available when i tried it before, retard me :]
[07:12:59] <NoiseEee> Xatenev: while you're at it, move .bind() to .on() and adjust the syntax a touch.  .bind() is deprecated.  http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:13:14] <Xatenev> oh damn hehe
[07:13:22] <Xatenev> ty for info, on it
[07:13:34] <NoiseEee> np
[07:13:38] <Xatenev> cud have tell me before anyways! :P

[07:24:05] <hellier> thanks gnarf!! was getting ready to rip my hair out ha
[07:24:42] <gobbie> hello all! happy monday
[07:25:12] <gnarf> hellier: added an edit
[07:27:21] <gnarf> hellier: if it works for you, checkmark appreciated ;)
[07:31:33] <hellier> gnarf will do just getting it to work first :p
[07:37:36] <hellier> gnarf how to best pass the button element into the function? You have it inside the function atm. :( the element will change on each form
[07:37:58] <gnarf> hellier I'll add more about that
[07:38:30] <gnarf> hellier: do we need to worry about the "counter" logic?
[07:38:38] <hellier> nope
[07:38:38] <gnarf> will you ever be doing more than one of these at a time?
[07:38:41] <gnarf> okay
[07:38:46] <gnarf> much easier then
[07:38:47] <gnarf> :)
[07:39:01] <gnarf> would you rather see the $.ajaxPrefilter example
[07:39:04] <gnarf> ?
[07:39:22] <hellier> If possible yeah :D
[07:39:27] <hellier> curious to see that
[07:40:30] <gnarf> what do you want to do about the body?
[07:40:34] <gnarf> always?
[07:40:38] <gnarf> or only when passed a button?
[07:41:00] <hellier> always would be best
[07:41:10] <hellier> umm, not sure the difference?
[07:41:19] <gnarf> every $.ajax call
[07:41:29] <gnarf> or only ones that you invoke the "disableButton" logic?
[07:41:39] <hellier> oh, only when its invoked
[07:46:51] <gnarf> hellier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29212220/jquery-adding-a-setting-to-the-ajax-function/29212667#29212667
[07:53:54] <hellier> Thanks gnarf! works perfectly
[07:54:03] <hellier> reckon the ajaxPrefilter is better?
[07:55:54] <gnarf> personally, I would still prefer using the "my own method that calls ajax" route
[07:56:01] <gnarf> but ajaxPrefilter is convenient
[07:56:34] <gnarf> I would suggest adding a "namespace" to the disableSelection option tho, like myCompanyDisableSelection - so anyone looking at it doesn't think it's some default thing and can go search the code for that string
[07:56:50] <gnarf> ^^^ discoverability of where the code is being executed is my concern
[07:56:50] <hellier> ah i see. ty
[07:57:01] <gnarf> by sticking with the "doAjax" route its pretty easy to find the behavior
[08:00:00] <hellier> aye
[08:02:28] <gnarf> the prefilter method has a composability win though, when you add another "type" of option, you can make it it's own prefilter instead of constantly decorating doAjax
[08:02:54] <gnarf> just depends a bit on how many people will be contributing to the code, and how hard you want to make finding that chunk of behavior for yourself
[08:05:16] <hellier> awesome :P
[08:05:39] <hellier> stuck your answer in my source code for future reference anyway :P
[08:05:40] <hellier> thanks again
[08:07:06] <MalMen> <div id="teste">    <select>        <option value="1">wqeq</option>        <option value="2">wqeqweq</option>        <option value="3">sadsdadsa</option>    </select></div> <- in this example how can i get the current value of option selected only knowing the id of the div ?

[08:16:31] <cyberbrai> gnarf yes
[08:16:39] <gnarf> also, like, you really shouldn't be doing this much work with id's - having an id="1" is just kind of bad, ID must be unique on the page
[08:16:46] <gnarf> perhaps data-id="1" ?
[08:17:08] <gnarf> instead of storing the id... $(this).closest('li').attr('id')
[08:17:11] <gnarf> just store the li
[08:17:20] <cyberbrai> on my fiddle i am not doing so much
[08:17:36] <gnarf> var li = $(this).closest('li'); var module = li.find('.module_name');
[08:17:57] <gnarf> log the whole selection, why care about id?
[08:18:12] <cyberbrai> gnarf are you this work
[08:19:01] <cyberbrai> actually i want  on click in  .blackboxbig-User then i want to  get the li id
[08:19:13] <gnarf> cyberbrai: http://jsfiddle.net/f137k0Lb/1/
[08:19:43] <gnarf> cyberbrai: I'm telling you store the "id" in data-id if it's ilke the id of the user in the system
[08:19:49] <gnarf> then you can .data('id') to read it
[08:20:15] <cyberbrai> oooh this is not my problem dude
[08:20:59] <gnarf> then what is the problem?
[08:21:00] <cyberbrai> click on first user see the console it's return two module name  Object
[08:21:02] <cyberbrai> [div#text123.module_name]
[08:21:03] <cyberbrai> Object[div#text43.editmodule_name]
[08:21:09] <gnarf> yup
[08:21:21] <gnarf> and the second one doesn't have an element with class='editmodule_name'
[08:21:41] <cyberbrai> yes then why they give me the editmodule name
[08:22:10] <gnarf> it doesnt?
[08:22:16] <cyberbrai> editmodule name is not exist in first li
[08:22:40] <cyberbrai> click on first user dude see the console
[08:22:56] <gnarf> yes it does
[08:23:00] <gnarf> look at the html
[08:23:00] <gnarf> https://www.dropbox.com/s/p66mw7c8l57nvtg/Screenshot%202015-03-23%2011.22.53.png?dl=0
[08:23:24] <gnarf> you are never closing your first <li>
[08:23:27] <gnarf> so everything else is inside it
[08:24:37] <cyberbrai> https://unsee.cc/mupiteso/
[08:24:38] <cyberbrai> see the image may be you got
[08:24:58] <gnarf> cyberbrai: in your html
[08:25:15] <gnarf> the <li id="1"> does indeed have a <div class="editmodule_name"> as a child
[08:25:17] <gnarf> you never close it
[08:25:32] <gnarf> inspect it
[08:25:48] <cyberbrai> yeah i know that i am not closing my  <li>  so is there any way to resolve this issue
[08:26:16] <gnarf> write valid html?
[08:26:27] <gnarf> write better selectors?
[08:26:31] <gnarf> fix your assumptions?
[08:26:46] <gnarf> what are you actually trying to do
[08:26:59] <cyberbrai> gnarf i have to put li into ol without clocsing it at the end i have to close it
[08:29:13] <gnarf> then don't use your "li" as your "data parent"
[08:29:41] <gnarf> either way, when you write "standard" html, with like closing tags and appropriate tabbing, it's a lot easier to read/understand these problems
[08:30:19] <cyberbrai> gnarf ok wait a min
[08:31:00] <gnarf> say you make everything about the user contained in a <div class="user-data" data-id="1">....</div> -- along with its button, etc, then it's not based on your <li>'s "problems"
[08:31:42] <gnarf> you can var user = $(this).closest('.user-data');  console.log(user.data('id')); console.log(user.find('.editmodule_name')); etc
[08:32:06] <cyberbrai> gnarf  ol is parent
[08:32:33] <gnarf> I'm saying reduce the scope of your "search up" - add another container
[08:32:59] <gnarf> if you need to exclude "some items" from being "found" when searching, the <li> is the wrong place to be "searching from"
[08:33:12] <gnarf> and your html just represents a mess
[08:34:35] <cyberbrai> i know that  my html is just a mess
[08:34:51] <gnarf> if you fix it, you can make it easier to work with from jQuery :)
[08:35:03] <cyberbrai> gnarf ok
[08:37:02] <cyberbrai> gnarf thank for help friend
[08:38:57] <skullcrasher> how the heck can I find out which function causes an error? I always get an error in jquery line 6180: this.pos = eased = jQuery.easing[ this.easing ]
[08:40:08] <skullcrasher> It says Uncaught TypeError undefined is not a function
[08:40:20] <skullcrasher> but the parameters given in this.easing seem to be ok
[08:41:57] <gnarf> what is this.easing ?
[08:42:08] <gnarf> and what is jQuery.easing[ this.easing ] ?
[08:42:47] <gnarf> can you turn on the debugger on uncaught errors and just look at those values?
[08:43:31] <skullcrasher> gnarf, jQuery.easing should be some core stuff, at it's in jquery.js line 6180
[08:43:41] <skullcrasher> if you can tell me how, I will do this :)
[08:43:59] <gnarf> that could happen I think if you were to pass easing: "easeInOutBounce" to an animation without definining the jQuery.easing method for it (are you forgetting to include jquery ui or the additional easings)
[08:45:03] <skullcrasher> ok, could be the case. Actually I use a plugin that throws this error messages, not my own code :)
[08:45:07] <gnarf> skullcrasher: I'm aware that it is inside jQuery - in your debugger, there is a "pause on execptions" button probably --- in chrome it's under "sources" and looks like a "pause button in a circle"
[08:45:59] <gnarf> in the upper-rightish area, near the other buttons like step over/etc
[08:46:15] <gnarf> then it should break when it hits the error
[08:46:23] <skullcrasher> ahh yes, it does
[08:46:32] <gnarf> hit "escape" to bring up a console
[08:46:35] <gnarf> and type this.easing
[08:46:53] <gnarf> (or like poke around in the scope variables section and find that value)
[08:47:44] <gnarf> you >might< also be able to step your way backwards in the "call stack" pane and find the "offending" call to animate
[08:48:09] <skullcrasher> ok, got it. it's an object {direction:"vertical",scale:"box"}
[08:48:27] <gnarf> but no "easing" property?
[08:48:40] <skullcrasher> this.easing is an object
[08:48:43] <gnarf> or the easing has an object?
[08:48:46] <gnarf> okay
[08:48:48] <gnarf> thats definitely very strange
[08:48:52] <gnarf> easing should be a string
[08:49:07] <skullcrasher> and "this" is Tween.init
[08:49:25] <gnarf> does the call stack lend any clues to where the animation is "called" ?
[08:50:39] <gnarf> skullcrasher: any chance you can link me to the actual problem site?
[08:51:08] <gnarf> skullcrasher: thinking about it
[08:52:21] <skullcrasher> yes, seems like the plugin is calling it wrong i think
[08:52:24] <gnarf> it almost sounds like a call to jQuery UI effects method, but without jQuery UI effects... something like .toggle("effect", {direction: "vertical", scale: "box" });
[08:52:33] <gnarf> skullcrasher: did you find the call to animate?
[08:52:38] <gnarf> how was it done?
[08:53:29] <gnarf> I could see the base jQuery toggle/hide/show methods interpreting an options object like that as a value for "easing"
[08:57:11] <skullcrasher> https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/blob/master/dist/jquery.fancytree-all.js#L3418
[08:57:19] <skullcrasher> this seems to be the call
[08:58:25] <skullcrasher> the "effect" parameter looks as following: http://paste.good-times.eu/index.php/ivB/
[08:59:05] <skullcrasher> also to note maybe is, that when I click and it runs the function, the first run has no problems. But then there is a second one which causes the error
[09:01:18] <skullcrasher> gnarf, looks like the parameters passed to animate are totally mixed up ... the callback is 200 (which i think should be the speed) while speed is "blind" (easing function)
[09:03:23] <gnarf> try including jquery ui effects?
[09:03:26] <gnarf> do you already have it?
[09:04:35] <skullcrasher> I just look for it, thought the same.
[09:07:03] <Katharsis> how to check if the form.submit with file uploading is finished the requests?
[09:08:11] <skullcrasher> gnarf, pew. That was it ... Not the whole jquery-ui.js was included but only parts. The effects/effect-blind was missing ....
[09:08:14] <skullcrasher> thank you so much
[09:09:46] <skullcrasher> was looking for the error for so long -.-
[09:10:28] <gnarf> no problem
[09:12:41] <robertmaxrees> good morning everybody
[09:39:59] <Omar-> is there a way to create a function to retrieve specific string in a url. e.g. "pFMp103" http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/18twpomw/
[09:40:46] <robertmaxrees> it'll always be after "gallery"?
[09:41:43] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i updated the fiddle with the function we made together before
[09:41:54] <robertmaxrees> you have to send the updated URL.
[09:42:04] <Omar-> robertmaxrees not always after gallery
[09:42:22] <Omar-> sometimes image, sometimes imgur.com/ID
[09:42:39] <robertmaxrees> send the updated fiddle out please...
[09:42:46] <robertmaxrees> and give better URL examples.
[09:42:49] <Omar-> it's not constant
[09:42:57] <Omar-> same url above
[09:43:08] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/18twpomw/
[09:43:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/18twpomw/ doesn't have the function you're talking about.
[09:43:19] <robertmaxrees> woah hah okayt.
[09:43:21] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[09:43:32] <robertmaxrees> could you add more URL examples?
[09:43:32] <Omar-> ;)
[09:43:36] <Omar-> sure
[09:43:39] <Omar-> i'll add more
[09:43:41] <Omar-> give me a sec
[09:43:51] <robertmaxrees> ah you hit "set as base" i'm guessing.
[09:46:39] <Omar-> robertmaxrees refresh fiddle
[09:46:44] <Omar-> yes, I always set as base
[09:46:58] <Omar-> not always, to often
[09:47:02] <Omar-> too*
[09:49:03] <Omar-> so far I saw about 100 entrie with /gallery/
[09:49:08] <Omar-> but not /image/
[09:50:26] <robertmaxrees> easy-peasy.  check to see if the url contains /gallery/ or /image/
[09:50:51] <Omar-> sometimes /a/
[09:50:52] <robertmaxrees> and go from there.
[09:50:53] <Omar-> haha
[09:51:05] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:52:08] <Omar-> i'll try it
[09:52:15] <Omar-> regex?
[09:52:26] <robertmaxrees> string.indexOf()
[09:53:35] <mooncup> anyone had much experience with flot?
[09:54:38] <hollusion> lets say i visited a site via URL#hash and now i click into the browsers address bar, change the hash and hit enter <-- how can i detect that the hash got modified?
[09:55:00] <cranderson> save it
[09:55:11] <cranderson> then test against it
[09:55:34] <hollusion> but how do i detect the "hit enter"
[09:55:58] <cranderson> onkeydown and the enter integer value
[09:56:08] <hollusion> i see
[09:56:16] <hollusion> i thought there would be an event or smth like that
[09:56:20] <hollusion> thank you
[09:57:09] <cranderson> there is : https://api.jquery.com/keydown/
[09:57:19] <tasaif> he meant changing the url
[09:57:31] <hollusion> but what if i want to do a smth even if the hash didnt change
[09:57:37] <cranderson> ahh. not to my knowledge
[09:57:51] <tasaif> hollusion: what are you doing if you don't mind me asking
[09:58:08] <hollusion> i am sending an id via the hash
[09:58:20] <hollusion> and i want to make an ajax request using that id
[09:58:44] <robertmaxrees> hollusion there's a hashchange event
[09:58:57] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/hashchange
[09:59:00] <cranderson> you could make one tho!
[09:59:08] <cranderson> oh dang
[09:59:28] <hollusion> oh wow its even supported on all the major browsers
[09:59:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:59:43] <lilsammy> Can i create an array using a each loop the use said array as ajax data?
[09:59:55] <robertmaxrees> lilsammy ... sure?
[10:00:08] <robertmaxrees> though usually you don't need each.
[10:00:11] <lilsammy> http://pastebin.com/KFQmYJhd
[10:00:32] <lilsammy> I didn't want to pass values of optional fields
[10:00:35] <robertmaxrees> check out map.
[10:00:51] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/map/ lilsammy
[10:00:58] <lilsammy> $.makeArray( fakeArray )
[10:01:06] <lilsammy> yeah on it :P thanks for the heads up
[10:01:11] <hollusion> robertmaxrees: but that wont trigger if the hash stayed the same
[10:01:12] <lilsammy> should of asked 2 hours ago
[10:01:35] <hollusion> there is no way to get the hash every time the user has focus on the browsers address bar and hits enter, right?
[10:03:04] <cranderson> you can write a funciton to do this.
[10:03:44] <Omar-> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/9z7dkkte/ is there a way to make it shorter?
[10:04:03] <robertmaxrees> hollusion why do you care if the hash hasn't changed?
[10:04:34] <robertmaxrees> Omar- yeah, one sec.
[10:04:43] <Omar-> thanks :)
[10:05:11] <robertmaxrees> Omar- what kind of browser support do you need?
[10:06:21] <hollusion> robertmaxrees: well if i use them as an anchor they work, like if i scroll down and then execute the url#hash again i will jump to the anchor with id="hash"
[10:06:32] <hollusion> but i want to do js things instead of jumping to anchor
[10:06:35] <hollusion> even if the hash hasnt changed
[10:06:50] <robertmaxrees> hollusion on click of an anchor?  or when then user hits enter in the URL bar?
[10:07:05] <hollusion> the latter
[10:07:37] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have to manually track whether or not the hash has changed and go from there.
[10:08:08] <hollusion> so there is no way of detecting an "url bar enter hit"
[10:09:26] <robertmaxrees> not the way that you're thinking, no.
[10:09:34] <robertmaxrees> you could play around with event listeners and see though.
[10:10:11] <Omar-> robertmaxrees all + mobile browsers
[10:10:21] <robertmaxrees> Omar- IE8?
[10:10:25] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm actually asking.
[10:10:26] <Omar-> no
[10:10:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:10:31] <Omar-> forget IE
[10:10:40] <robertmaxrees> that's a ballsy move, but OK :)
[10:10:42] <Omar-> thanks, this is kind of you
[10:10:52] <Omar-> haha
[10:11:11] <Omar-> robertmaxrees its for fun, so don't take it seriously
[10:11:16] <Omar-> the whole app
[10:11:26] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/yunuhu
[10:13:22] <SmashingX2> how can I add a scroll down option for a jquery mobile popup?
[10:13:36] <Omar-> hollusion $("html").animate({ scrollTop: $(location.hash).offset().top });
[10:14:04] <Omar-> SmashingX2 you mean dropdown list? <select>?
[10:14:29] <robertmaxrees> Omar- - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9z7dkkte/1/ this isn't necessarily functional at the moment, but it should give you the general ide.a
[10:14:31] <SmashingX2> Omar-: no a scrolldown bar.
[10:15:05] <SmashingX2> Omar-: I’m tring to show 10 elements as a list but they don’t fit in the screen so Im trying to put them in a scrolldown option
[10:15:06] <Omar-> SmashingX2 I dont think it's possible in popup unless you play with it's CSS
[10:15:24] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 you want overflow: scroll; and then set a height.
[10:15:26] <Omar-> robertmaxrees thanks a lot
[10:15:43] <robertmaxrees> Omar- the idea is to use array.some() and array.indexOf() to find stuff.
[10:15:52] <robertmaxrees> stop using for loops.
[10:17:25] <Omar-> robertmaxrees lol, I didn't use any loop
[10:17:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm out of it today, but you knbow what i mean.
[10:18:04] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: so you mean I have to do it through CSS?
[10:18:09] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 yes.
[10:18:20] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i need index of ['/gallery/', '/image/', '/a/'] as I did in my previous fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/9z7dkkte/)
[10:18:29] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: So, there’s no like a native option that I can use for this?
[10:18:38] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 not that i'm aware of.
[10:18:38] <Omar-> robertmaxrees got your idea. appreciated!
[10:18:56] <robertmaxrees> Omar- my point is to play around with the native array methods to get what you want instea.d
[10:19:10] <Omar-> SmashingX2 popups are meant for small content
[10:19:19] <SmashingX2> ok
[10:19:21] <Omar-> anyway let me try
[10:19:34] <Omar-> SmashingX2 give some time to test it
[10:19:47] <Omar-> robertmaxrees ok, will do
[10:21:33] <Omar-> SmashingX2 can you post in a fiddle sample of content you want to add to a popup?
[10:21:37] <tasaif> can I fire a custom event on a coordinate?
[10:23:22] <robertmaxrees> tasaif you could try to find the element at that coordinate and fire it on that element.
[10:23:34] <lilsammy> can anyone tell me why http://pastebin.com/CmnWHV2C this is putting the correct values to console but via ajax everything is undefined
[10:23:36] <tasaif> that's an idea
[10:27:48] <Omar-> SmashingX2 http://jsbin.com/niluba/1/edit?html,css
[10:28:17] <SmashingX2> Omar-: Thanks but I didn’t want to use CSS
[10:28:35] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 you have to.
[10:28:45] <robertmaxrees> even if you use jquery, you'd use it to apply css.
[10:30:49] <cranderson> lilsammy: data:JSON.stringify(data),
[10:31:10] <cranderson> need to send them as a string across the interwebs'
[10:31:38] <cranderson> then use somesort of server side decode to turn them back into a object
[10:31:53] <cranderson> or array, whatever your method of destruction is.
[10:33:30] <Omar-> SmashingX2 you custom CSS it's a CSS issue
[10:34:00] <Omar-> you have to use custon CSS
[10:34:15] <Omar-> custom*
[10:46:26] <Omar-> robertmaxrees index of any matching strings is always "3", so I hardcoded splitURL[4] http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/9z7dkkte/2/
[10:46:36] <robertmaxrees> sure why not.
[10:46:39] <robertmaxrees> that's one way to do it.
[10:46:59] <Omar-> i'll adopt this code and do further tests
[10:47:28] <Omar-> thanks for introducing me to a new function :)
[10:47:49] <robertmaxrees> check out the full list on MDN - there are tons of useful array methods.
[10:49:10] <Omar-> robertmaxrees the problem is, if I use some() today, I'll forget it tomorrow
[10:49:23] <Omar-> I dont code much, just when I have free time to
[10:49:36] <robertmaxrees> just need to get used to knowing that it's there
[10:49:44] <Omar-> btw, I'm using this code (http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/8gsvmamq/) to connect to imgur
[10:49:44] <tasaif> ok, so I have this
[10:49:44] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/t80m0vra/2/
[10:49:55] <tasaif> how do I activate the hover on the box?
[10:50:23] <decx> slowly back away from coffeescript
[10:50:24] <robertmaxrees> tasaif you're more likely to get assistance if you use plain JS instead of coffeescript.
[10:50:31] <Omar-> imgur API URL is either /image/ or /gallery/ or /album/
[10:50:33] <tasaif> one minute
[10:50:52] <robertmaxrees> and don't paste the stuff CF generates - that's always some funky js
[10:51:18] <tasaif> yea, I've noticed
[10:51:25] <Omar-> so I connect to imgur with different URL until I get success, is that a good practice?
[10:51:47] <Omar-> jsfiddle is slow today
[10:51:53] <robertmaxrees> Omar- you should have a good url already...
[10:52:19] <Omar-> robertmaxrees it's difficult
[10:52:30] <Omar-> var url = "https://api.imgur.com/3/gallery or image or album/" + id;
[10:52:41] <robertmaxrees> but you already have the original URL, right?
[10:52:48] <robertmaxrees> like, that's how it was submitted to you.
[10:53:10] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/t80m0vra/3/
[10:53:28] <Omar-> robertmaxrees https://twitter.com/imgurAPI/status/577901223023681536
[10:53:29] <b-ot> Omar-: @imgurAPI: @jQM_Tricks Think of /image/* as a superset of all /gallery/* items. Always fallback to the former and check the latter for gallery data :)
[10:53:52] <robertmaxrees> Omar- lol
[10:53:56] <Omar-> lol
[10:53:56] <robertmaxrees> then why ask the question?
[10:54:11] <robertmaxrees> if somebody submitted a good url to you, use that url.
[10:54:13] <Omar-> the question is about "the way i'm doing it"
[10:54:24] <Omar-> code-wise
[10:54:26] <robertmaxrees> right, and my answer is "you're doing it wrong"
[10:54:41] <Omar-> this is the answer I wanted!
[10:54:42] <Omar-> lol
[10:54:48] <robertmaxrees> tasaif so what you you mean "activate the hover on the box"?
[10:55:35] <decx> why do you use a separate cursor-tracker overlay?
[10:55:51] <tasaif> how else can I track the cursor?
[10:55:53] <tasaif> am I being stupid?
[10:56:06] <decx> e.pageX/Y?
[10:56:10] <decx> like you already do
[10:56:44] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: when I hover over .box, i want it to turn yellow
[10:56:51] <Omar-> robertmaxrees how should I do it?
[10:57:02] <tasaif> the css says .box:hover {background-color: yellow}
[10:57:20] <robertmaxrees> Omar- do what?  i'm very lost about what problem you're now trying to solve.
[10:57:27] <decx> you overlay is the culprit
[10:57:29] <decx> your*
[10:57:45] <robertmaxrees> you have something about a URL and an id you're getting from that URL, and then something about needing to get the valid URL, which you ostensibly already have.
[10:57:52] <decx> you never hover .box because overlay snags up all the pointer events
[10:58:17] <tasaif> this is true
[10:59:07] <tasaif> but I need to overlay to track the cursor
[10:59:24] <decx> do you though?
[10:59:55] <tasaif> unless there's another way to move a fake cursor around
[11:00:11] <Omar-> robertmaxrees ID issue is solved thanks to you.
[11:01:06] <Omar-> the other question is about connecting to imgur API using the ID. the base url is "https://api.imgur.com/3/folder/ID"
[11:01:20] <robertmaxrees> except you already have the proper URL< right?
[11:01:21] <Omar-> folder is either gallery, image or album
[11:01:45] <Omar-> right.
[11:01:58] <robertmaxrees> then why are you testing for the correct URL?
[11:02:02] <robertmaxrees> you already have it.
[11:02:13] <Omar-> what I'm doing is, I connect to /gallery/, if ajax call fail, I try with /image/, fail again /album/
[11:02:34] <robertmaxrees> why?  why can't you just use the URL you already have?
[11:03:00] <Omar-> robertmaxrees because this is how it goes
[11:03:23] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange problem to have.  i'd just store the valid URL elsewhere and call it a day.
[11:03:43] <Omar-> robertmaxrees unfortunately it's not the way with imgur
[11:03:57] <Omar-> the tweet i posted before is by imgur API staff
[11:04:39] <robertmaxrees> something here really isn't adding up.  where are the original URLs coming from?  The ones getting submitted to you?  what does that have to do with the tweet?
[11:04:51] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to find a valid URL that you already have.  that's why i'm confused.
[11:05:00] <Omar-> I'll elaborate
[11:05:11] <Omar-> I dont have the complete URL
[11:05:21] <Omar-> I'm missing /folder/
[11:05:51] <Omar-> because the "post/ID" can be found in either /gallery/, /image/ or /album/
[11:06:12] <robertmaxrees> why isn't that URL the same as the one originally given to you?
[11:07:03] <Omar-> which url do you mean?
[11:07:18] <Omar-> sorry, base url ""https://api.imgur.com/3/"
[11:07:41] <Omar-> to connect to API you need "/folder/ID"
[11:07:49] <Omar-> so all together "https://api.imgur.com/3/folder/ID"
[11:07:50] <robertmaxrees> from what i understand, you currently get a url from somewhere.  you then extract an ID from this url.  you then try to find the proper imgur url using this ID.
[11:08:04] <Omar-> exactly
[11:08:12] <Omar-> ohh I got what you mean
[11:08:42] <Omar-> I cant connect by "http://i.imgur.com/S1EzN1j.png" for example
[11:08:52] <Omar-> those URLs I get from reddit API
[11:09:14] <Omar-> the URLs as in the post here http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/9z7dkkte/3/
[11:09:45] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don't understand why you're getting bad data in the first palce.
[11:10:53] <Omar-> you mean if I connect "https://api.imgur.com/3/gallery/Sf5Fgs"?
[11:11:17] <Omar-> if Sf5Fgs isn't in /gallery/ it could be in /image/
[11:11:18] <robertmaxrees> is the API URL not the same as the original one you're getting?
[11:11:24] <Omar-> if not in /album/
[11:11:32] <Omar-> no, they are different
[11:11:52] <robertmaxrees> okay - that clears a lot  up.  if you can't check that server side, i guess some ajax love could work if that's what their docs say to do.
[11:12:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds really funky that they don't have some kind of lookup to do this.
[11:12:30] <Omar-> I get URLs from reddit => extract imgur ID => use it to connect to imgur API to get further data
[11:12:33] <Omar-> yup, it is
[11:12:38] <robertmaxrees> right.  i get that now.
[11:13:29] <Omar-> all the mess up starts in line 18 http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/8gsvmamq/
[11:13:34] <Omar-> error callback
[11:14:02] <Omar-> i'm calling the same function from within it
[11:14:21] <Omar-> function foo() { foo() });
[11:14:22] <robertmaxrees> create an array of potential URLs and hit each one in turn.
[11:14:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll still have to call the function from inside itself, but that might work a bit better?
[11:15:29] <Omar-> the code works as it should, I'm just concerned whether it's a good practive
[11:15:34] <Omar-> practice
[11:16:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd push this all server-side if possible and store the legit URL there instead.
[11:16:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're hammering their servers a whole bunch
[11:17:31] <Omar-> i'm not using any server and intending to. i'm just playing around with code
[11:17:37] <Omar-> not intending
[11:17:47] <robertmaxrees> then that's about as good as it's going to get.
[11:18:15] <Omar-> their servers can bear my calls. haha
[11:18:27] <robertmaxrees> still extra, unnecessary, repeated work ;)
[11:19:52] <Omar-> true :/
[11:20:31] <Omar-> anyway, i have to go now
[11:20:37] <Omar-> thanks a lot robertmaxrees :)

[11:24:03] <Guest92734> Have a g1 Omar-
[11:24:10] <Omar-> you too, thanks :)
[11:24:12] <Omar-> adios
[11:24:52] <Guest92734> That's awesome robertmaxrees. My primary support guy. ;)
[11:25:06] <Guest92734> For Jquery. Hah
[11:31:36] <MikeD_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1886#comment:30  is there a difference between those two syntaxes?
[11:32:08] <robertmaxrees> Array.prototype.reduce.call(this, callback, initial); vs $.fn.reduce = [].reduce; ?
[11:32:32] <MikeD_> yes
[11:33:47] <robertmaxrees> those are basically the same thing, though the idea of a jquery reduce seems wrong to me
[11:35:45] <MikeD_> yeah, once I realized that it would require wrapping an array in a $() i decided it was dumb.
[11:36:39] <ryanneufeld> I think rick pretty much summed up that this wasn't gonna happen http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1886#comment:24
[11:37:11] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[11:37:28] <robertmaxrees> i just don't get what people would expect $.fn.reduce to do
[11:37:49] <ryanneufeld> that you can't do with map, or each, or any of the other iteration helpers
[11:38:02] <AlluringMe_> 1.2.1 :S
[11:38:05] <AlluringMe_> 1.9+
[11:41:31] <MikeD_> i have a list that's sorted by datetime descending, I have a target datetime - i want to find the element that is nearest that datetime
[11:42:12] <MikeD_> that's smallest of Math.abs( target.datetime - element.datetime )
[11:42:33] <MikeD_> but i'm not sure if iterating the whole array makes any sense
[11:44:59] <decx> how else are you gonna find out?
[11:45:43] <MikeD_> if I have a sorted array, I should early exit as soon as the difference starts going back up
[11:46:16] <decx> good thinking
[11:46:19] <decx> do that then ;)
[11:46:38] <MikeD_> is there an iterator that i can get out of, or do i just loop ?
[11:46:56] <decx> you can put it in a function an return
[11:47:00] <decx> and*
[11:58:28] <doug16k> MikeD_, you can break out of Array .some
[12:00:04] <doug16k> MikeD_, but if it is sorted, you should use a binary search
[12:00:17] <doug16k> the operation you are asking for is commonly referred to as "lower bound"
[12:01:25] <MikeD_> i'm just not 'getting' the way to do this procedurally - i'm stuck thinking declarative SQL
[12:07:48] <doug16k> MikeD_, var best = Math.Infinity; var bestIndex = foo.some(function(v, i) { val diff = Math.abs(best-v.datetime); if (diff < best) diff = best; else if (diff > best) return i - 1; })
[12:08:09] <doug16k> oops, best = diff
[12:08:28] <doug16k> but if there are a lot of items, a binary search is much faster
[12:08:33] <doug16k> how many items do you expect?
[12:10:08] <MikeD_> that's pretty much what I did, http://jsfiddle.net/477yqx74/
[12:10:28] <sacho> wow
[12:10:30] <sacho> that's a lot of code
[12:10:56] <MikeD_> haha, yeah... but I wanted to spell it all out so i can see what I'm doing
[12:14:48] <sacho> me too
[12:14:51] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/477yqx74/3/
[12:16:01] <sacho> were you going for a binary search?
[12:25:03] <chatmasta> Hello. Is there an event attribute similar to e.target, but returns the element selected by the selector? Reason I ask is because e.target can be any inner element, not necessarily the one selected.
[12:26:55] <chatmasta> e.currentTarget is what I wanted. Thanks :)
[12:40:18] <SmashingX2> what is the setting to avoid rounded corners on windows?
[12:46:18] <MikeD_> sacho, no - was not looking for binary search since the data i'm looking for is probably nearest the top of the descending sort.  tbh, there shouldn't be so many values in the list that it matters what approach I use
[12:47:03] <MikeD_> but thanks for the code example
[12:58:18] <SmashingX2> how can I add a custom icon to a button?
[13:13:59] <Sal> hi

[13:14:33] <Sal> reack=reach
[13:14:41] <Sal> inout=input
[13:14:55] <Sal> shouldn't closest do it?
[13:15:24] <Sal> or does closest only go up the dom ?
[13:15:35] <NoiseEee> yeah closest goes up
[13:16:04] <Sal> hmm
[13:16:05] <NoiseEee> youd have to closest('div').find('input')
[13:16:17] <Sal> ok, thanks
[13:20:27] <SmashingX2> how can I add a custom icon to a button?
[13:20:33] <SmashingX2> in jquery mobile

[13:37:24] <SmashingX2> I have the second button repeating the image many times. How can I avoid this?
[13:38:26] <robertmaxrees> look at the way the markup is setup on all the others.
[13:41:44] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: how?
[13:42:04] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: the others are jquery default icons

[13:48:46] <rsimpson> Has anyone seen a jquery slideshow gallery that looks somewhat like this? http://www.apm-dev.com/
[13:49:01] <rsimpson> this is in flash and needs to be converted to HTML for mobile
[13:49:30] <robertmaxrees> woah
[14:18:50] <Sal> is there a way in jquery ti call a function with a string?
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> whosawhat?
[14:19:17] <SmashingX2> how can I make the size of a popup dynamic? I mean when I resize the windows I would like the popup to be dynamic
[14:19:54] <Sal> something like call app + '_load'
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> what function would that call?
[14:20:43] <Sal> a function in a html loaded by ajax
[14:20:56] <rsimpson> Can anyone tell me if they have ever seen a plugin that would create a gallery like this one: apm-dev.com
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> O.o that's code smell. i'd avoid that if you could.
[14:21:09] <Sal> its formed by the html file name + '_load'
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> rsimpson i haven't seen anything like that but i'd consider redesigning that.
[14:21:47] <Sal> robertmaxrees, why?
[14:21:54] <rsimpson> yeah tell me about it. That is what I have been asked to do
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> dynamically loading code is generally a bad idea, Sal.
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like you're trying logic to your html too much.
[14:22:33] <rsimpson> it has to be mobile friendly and written in flash
[14:22:40] <Sal> angularjs is all based on dinamic loaded stuff
[14:22:58] <robertmaxrees> rsimpson "written in flash" and "mobile friendly" are at odds with one another.
[14:23:15] <rsimpson> yeah so I have to take what is in flash right now and turn it into html5
[14:23:20] <Sal> rsimpson, use adobe AIR then
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> Sal that's for apps, not for websites.
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> Sal also, needing to call functions whose names are based on filenames or whatever is pretty weird.
[14:23:42] <Sal> who said i'm making a website?
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> rsimpson implied it.
[14:24:03] <robertmaxrees> that *they're* making one, i mean.
[14:24:05] <Sal> i just need to call a function whos name is in a string
[14:24:06] <Sal> thats all
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> Sal you can do that, but it's hacky.
[14:24:21] <Sal> i tried window['name']()
[14:24:29] <Sal> bt its not working
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> window[someVar + '_load']();
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> or whatever the format was.
[14:24:49] <robertmaxrees> thgat assumes the function is globally available.
[14:31:28] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/yoluviyeyi/1/edit?html,js,console,output - how may I cancel the timeOut of a setinterval?
[14:31:56] <hellier> If you enter jibberish into the input, and see the console, you see that it doesn't reset the interval
[14:34:19] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to debounce something?
[14:35:05] <hellier> no?
[14:35:13] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish then?
[14:36:03] <hellier> reset the setinterval on each keystroke inside the input
[14:36:18] <hellier> or rather, whenever the vali function is called
[14:36:34] <robertmaxrees> so you only run it when the user is done inputting whatever?
[14:36:48] <hellier> I run it upon $('input').on('input', function() {
[14:36:52] <robertmaxrees> i see that.
[14:37:02] <robertmaxrees> what does the interval have to do with anything?
[14:37:05] <hellier> So whenever something changes inside that input
[14:37:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sounds like you want a debounce - make sure the function only runs after they're done inputting things, right?
[14:37:47] <hellier> It delays the validation
[14:39:45] <robertmaxrees> could use something like http://jsbin.com/tixuvatomo/1/edit?html,js,console,output

[16:00:22] <skypce> it is very complex
[16:00:38] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you have $someElement and you want to get a child of it?
[16:00:46] <skypce> yes
[16:00:49] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[16:00:57] <robertmaxrees> or use CSS.
[16:01:05] <skypce> it is not so easy
[16:01:12] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[16:01:21] <skypce> in some pages first ul li is a title
[16:01:24] <skypce> in other a simple element
[16:01:36] <skypce> and the pages doesnt have especific classes
[16:03:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something you should fix in your backend, but OK.

[16:08:49] <skypce> if i want bullets in dom only when ul li has strong that inside how can i do it?
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> use some convoluted js to set the list-style-type on the parent UL.
[16:11:37] <Rangedboyke> Thanks robertmaxrees!
[16:31:34] <Rangedboyke> Can someone help me? I don't understand why .jsonResult doesn't get updated with the items: http://pastebin.com/dRS9du3K
[16:31:58] <robertmaxrees> what's happening now?
[16:32:02] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:32:40] <Rangedboyke> nope
[16:33:00] <Rangedboyke> It just doesn't update after the for() {}
[16:33:17] <robertmaxrees> and you can console.log() before the .html and see the right data?
[16:34:04] <Rangedboyke> but adding an array this way to the html is possible?
[16:34:06] <skypce> robertmaxrees,
[16:34:13] <robertmaxrees> Rangedboyke not really a good idea.
[16:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you should .join() it first and get a string./
[16:34:31] <skypce> $("ul li:has(strong)").css("color","blue");
[16:34:31] <skypce>  i have this but i want that the ul li that have a strong inside apply a list-style none
[16:34:43] <Rangedboyke> Ehmm could you give an example?
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> skypce make a simplified fiddle.
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript array join
[16:34:56] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Array.prototype.join() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> Rangedboyke there you go.
[16:35:54] <skypce> if i select $("ul li:has(strong)").  a li with strong tag will be targeted or only the u li?
[16:36:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd opt for using .filter() or .contains()
[16:36:48] <robertmaxrees> but a simplified fiddle would be grea.t
[16:37:12] <skypce> i need something like .class + selector
[16:37:17] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:37:33] <skypce> i hate jsfiddle
[16:37:43] <skypce> takes me a lot of time do something in here
[16:38:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zLh204v2/
[16:38:06] <robertmaxrees> start with this.
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> so you have a case where the first LI might have a <strong> around its contents?
[16:39:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zLh204v2/2/ like this?  so the first one should have bullets, but the second one shouldn't? or what?
[16:41:43] <skypce> robertmaxrees, in some cases the first element have strong, but in general ul list have other
[16:41:45] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/zLh204v2/3/
[16:42:33] <robertmaxrees> okay - so what should happen for that li with the <strong>?
[16:43:03] <skypce> with strong , the ul li bullets needs disapear
[16:43:17] <skypce> in the second list need be keeped
[16:43:35] <robertmaxrees> for the following ul?
[16:43:51] <skypce> yes
[16:45:07] <skypce> i need do something only when ul li strong is present
[16:45:14] <robertmaxrees> i see that now.
[16:45:17] <robertmaxrees> give me a minute ;)
[16:45:26] <skypce> when ul li are without strong do other thing
[16:45:31] <robertmaxrees> slow down dude.

[17:30:14] <Rangedboyke> Nice! KrasivyMir it does work
[17:30:42] <Rangedboyke> but the only problem I've got right now is that <br /> is getting shown in stead of being a break on the website.
[17:30:55] <KrasivyMir> oh
[17:30:57] <KrasivyMir> cool

[17:39:02] <Sal> does anyone know how to get data from ckeditor?
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_savedata
[17:46:06] <tasaif> I have an ajax response, I've never navigated an XML response
[17:46:20] <tasaif> best way to find value by key?
[17:46:50] <tasaif> normally I would ask for a json response, but I don't have access to this server
[17:47:15] <Sal> robertmaxrees, maybe i'm getting blind, but i can't find anything on that page
[17:47:22] <Sal> let me look again
[17:47:38] <robertmaxrees> tasaif it's markup - treat it like you would HTML/.
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> Sal your question is very vague and that page seems to address it.
[17:48:16] <tasaif> will try
[17:48:33] <Sal> i need to get the text edited with ckeditor
[17:48:43] <Sal> the editor replaces my textarea
[17:48:52] <robertmaxrees> CKEDITOR.instances.editor1.getData(); looks like.
[17:48:57] <Sal> with its own div and hides my textarea
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> find the instance, then run getData() against it.
[17:49:12] <Sal> let me try it
[17:49:28] <robertmaxrees> that's the first heading in there - "Retrieving Data from CKEditor"
[17:49:49] <tasaif> http://all.hail.jquery.jpg.to
[17:51:36] <tasaif> Sal: a snippet from where I used CKEDITOR
[17:51:37] <tasaif> text: if CKEDITOR.instances[@rich_text_id()] then CKEDITOR.instances[@rich_text_id()].getData() else ''
[17:52:12] <Sal> thanks
[17:52:15] <Sal> checking it out
[17:52:39] <robertmaxrees> right, so find the instance, then run getData() against it ;)
[17:53:53] <Sal> got it
[17:54:05] <Sal> CKEDITOR.instances['myTextareaId'].getData();
[17:54:23] <tasaif> http://feivel.goes.west.crazy.eyes.gif.jpg.to/
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> or CKEDITOR.instances.myTextareaId.getData();
[17:54:52] <Sal> really?
[17:54:54] <Sal> let me try that
[17:55:11] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[17:55:28] <Sal> yep
[17:55:37] <Sal> but i have the id in a string
[17:55:47] <Sal> so i think i'll go with the array way
[17:55:49] <Sal> thanks guys
[17:55:53] <robertmaxrees> ah, then yeah you need square brakcet syntax.
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> not an array fwiw
[17:56:05] <Sal> no?
[17:56:10] <robertmaxrees> just an object.
[17:56:13] <Sal> aint it an array of objects?
[17:56:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:56:20] <robertmaxrees> just an object.
[17:56:23] <Sal> ok
[17:56:23] <robertmaxrees> with properties.
[17:56:31] <tasaif> semantics
[17:56:32] <Sal> oh, props
[17:56:33] <Sal> ok
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> not semantics.
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> that's literally what it is.
[17:57:19] <tasaif> totally
[17:57:29] <Sal> do i need to convert the data in some way before passing it via ajax to a pgp script?
[17:57:40] <Sal> its pure html text
[17:58:07] <tasaif> I don't know what a pgp script is
[17:58:15] <tasaif> but shouldn't ajax data be in key value pairs?
[17:58:22] <Sal> this is what i'm doing
[17:58:23] <Sal> http://i.imgur.com/HRjFAYF.png
[17:58:24] <tasaif> or a hash or something like that?
[17:58:24] <robertmaxrees> it can be in any format you want.
[17:58:36] <tasaif> you're making it sound dirty
[17:59:09] <tasaif> ajax be like, "Any. way. you. want"
[18:25:42] <smokeyd> hey all, is there a HTTP redirect Response I can return from my server that doesn't get handled transparently by the javascript engine, and thus can be caught by jquery?
[18:25:58] <SirLagz> smokeyd: what are you trying to do ?
[18:26:03] <smokeyd> Right now I return a 302 but jquery doesn't detect the 302 because the browser doesn't expose it
[18:26:25] <smokeyd> SirLagz: I have a form that I want to be able to load through plain http request, in which case it might return a redirect
[18:26:29] <smokeyd> which the browser should folow
[18:26:48] <smokeyd> but I would also like to load the same form through ajax, in shich case I want the browser not to follow the redirect
[18:27:16] <SirLagz> smokeyd: the AJAX request should expose the http code IIRC. are you using $.ajax to load it ?
[18:27:35] <smokeyd> it is a form submit, so $.post
[18:27:42] <SirLagz> ah right.
[18:28:31] <smokeyd> SirLagz: the browser just sets the HTTP code 200 because that is what is returned after the redirect completes
[18:28:42] <smokeyd> the 302 redirect is hidden from the javascript engine by the browser
[18:28:46] <SirLagz> smokeyd: right. I get what you mean now.
[18:29:03] <SirLagz> smokeyd: I ran into the same issue a little while ago...trying to remember how I worked around it
[18:30:26] <SirLagz> smokeyd: can't seem to remember right now...if I remember I'll let you know
[18:30:31] <smokeyd> ok, cool
[18:30:32] <smokeyd> thanks
[18:32:54] <smokeyd> I have a workaround. In the $.post I'll just send an extra variable to the server that let's the server decide whether or not to issue the redirect.
[18:39:52] <Sal> hey guys... how can i debug this to see if the data var is correctly built https://jsfiddle.net/6gmd3077/
[18:40:16] <Sal> is it easy to debug with jsfiddle?
[18:52:30] <duellsy> hey gang, I'm using a custom callback name for our ajax calls, but on some sites our module is being used we're getting an error that "eleviocallback is not a function', even though it still processes OK
[18:52:32] <duellsy> any ideas?
[18:56:29] <duellsy> jsonp sorry, not ajax
[19:05:22] <tasaif> duellsy: check out the stack trace in the developer console
[19:05:39] <tasaif> put a debugger right before it fails.
[19:06:02] <tasaif> check to make sure the object that has the method 'eleviocallback' is actually what you think it is
[19:26:30] <Sal> does anyone know why when i append a <tr> row to a table tbody, it inserts my <tr> row plus another empty <tr> row ?
[19:26:43] <Sal> strange and can't find why it happens
[19:26:50] <Sal> did it ever happen so anyone here?
[19:30:24] <Woet> Sal: reproduce it on www.jsfiddle.net
[19:31:23] <Sal> its a simple append('<tr><td>data</td></tr>')
[19:32:46] <Sal> Woet, http://i.imgur.com/gZkIuw2.png
[19:33:03] <Sal> could it be that damn tbody in the query?

[19:58:53] <sharonMARIPUSSY> thanks! I will take a look at it :)
[19:59:20] <m_zr0> sorry it’s not a detailed answer.  i know html5 supports some wicked touch interface tech though, maybe html5 is a better answer?

[20:00:24] <m_zr0> throw in a canvas element and betcha it goes AAAWWWW!!!
[20:23:55] <grodt> is it possible to save an element to a variable, but be able to edit that element,eg hide a div inside that element and store to var
[20:26:11] <crazyprodigy101> Yeah, you can do that.
[20:28:11] <crazyprodigy101> var variable = $('#elementID');  variable.addClass('hidden');  If this was what you meant.
[20:30:34] <grodt> crazyprodicgiy101 thanks n*gga

[22:22:48] <ISmithers> So I am using $(this).outerWidth(); and the item shows in the inspector as 262px wide, but I get 274px, if I delay the execute for say a second, then the value gotten is correct.
[22:22:50] <ISmithers> Why is this?

[22:34:11] <AJoshua> how once see my js using F12 debug
[22:36:54] <ISmithers> I found the issue, it is to do with only running it on window load.
[22:37:00] <ISmithers> Then the sizes are correct.
