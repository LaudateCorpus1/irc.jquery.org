[00:38:36] <admin123> how would you hide the dropdown if the user clicks outside the dropdown? https://jsfiddle.net/morenoh149/fhx6puq4/49/
[00:57:14] <admin123> nvm looking at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-do-i-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[04:27:03] <pavelz> hi, i have some events attached to elements but for some reason jQuery does not see them from the app, but in console, it triggers them just fine
[04:27:39] <pavelz> jQuery._data( cur, 'events') is empty in jquery but the same in console reports to have 'ajax:success' event bound
[04:27:58] <pavelz> im frazzled
[04:45:44] <IamTrying> I have 1/ $('#iframe').attr('src', 'Account.php'); 2/ .. activity... [close] .. 3/ $('#iframe').attr('src', '');. How can i trigger $(window).on("beforeunload", function() { } ); when Step 3 happen?
[04:59:01] <Cork> you can't really
[04:59:19] <Cork> you can do a message send from the outer window to the iframe window though
[04:59:26] <Cork> (make sure to do it safely though)
[05:01:00] <pavelz> hm, handler does not seem to be in internal data structures for ujs trigger
[05:02:48] <Cork> pavelz: jquery only knows about event that is bound throught jquery as the dom don't have a way to list event handlers
[05:22:55] <pavelz> Cork: but I did bind it, it is right there in the inspector
[05:23:12] <pavelz> but it is not in internal jquery structures, when app runs.
[05:23:31] <pavelz> but trigger works on said element from console
[05:24:00] <pavelz> wodndering if there is a way to update even cache or some such thing
[05:26:36] <pavelz> https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery.js#L5126
[05:26:55] <pavelz> here it is suppose to get a list of bound events and it is getting nil instead
[05:27:40] <pavelz> and here it does not get to call my handlers:
[05:27:41] <pavelz> https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery.js#L5130
[05:46:44] <Cork> pavelz: ya, but you need to figure out what you've done with the element to get jqeury to remove it (or have a different reference for it) when you get there
[05:48:10] <Cork> the list is normally, 1. event not bound yet, 2. event bound but on another instance of the element (element is replaced), 3. bound on the element, but the element is detatched from the dom
[08:10:08] <pavelz> Cork: $._data(element, 'event') returns my hooks but jquery does not seem to see it
[08:10:31] <pavelz> events even and 'handle' is the right one too
[08:11:39] <Cork> it most likely means you aren't checking for the same element jquery does
[08:19:23] <pavelz> yeah its weird but is ujs handles sending data-remote links in some other handler I wonder, because in inspector i can see only my event hanging off it
[08:19:50] <pavelz> winder how I go about fixing this app is pretty simple
[08:20:04] <Cork> if you can reproduce the problem in a minimal jsfiddle i could have a look at it, but currently i have no clue
[09:10:08] <pavelz> in what case $ != jQuery specifically when I replace jQuery with $ in jquery code my callbacks are called ?
[09:10:16] <pavelz> console.log says they are the same
[09:10:26] <pavelz> >:/
[09:11:29] <pavelz> this is just weird
[09:16:00] <Cork> pavelz: pages that load multiple versions of jquery, console in some browsers use $ for built in methods
[09:16:09] <Cork> your case is most likely the first one
[09:16:31] <Cork> and would explain why the event handler isn't in the list, as it is a different list for each jquery version
[09:19:07] <pavelz> Cork: yes it is the first one. INSANE.
[09:19:16] <pavelz> Cork: thanks!
[09:19:40] <Cork> pavelz: not really, logical, just another reason in the long list of why you don't want multiple versions of libraries in the same page
[09:20:31] <pavelz> well jquery ujs has 2.
[09:20:40] <pavelz> by default
[09:20:53] <pavelz> maybe there is something else going on
[09:21:36] <Cork> no, it is the reason
[09:22:01] <Cork> cause unless you use the same version for binding the event handler and trying to list it, things will break
[11:05:50] <rgr> I'm just adopting chrome devtools to debug js/jquery. Do any of you old hands know if there is a chrome extension or method to bring up jquery api context help inside the debugger? Would seem to be a great addition or feature.
[17:54:09] <Alex8532> Hi
[17:54:23] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:54:42] <Alex8532> Can anyone tell me where to find a multi-tag select widget?
[17:54:50] <Alex8532> Doing some Wordpress stuff, :(.
[17:54:59] <robertmaxrees> "a multi-tag select widget" - have an example?
[17:55:29] <Alex8532> https://material-ui.com/components/autocomplete/#multiple-values @ robertmaxrees
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> i assume you're not using that library?
[17:56:02] <Alex8532> Or someone just tell me how to select multiple items that looks google on smart devices.
[17:56:23] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees:  That is correct.  I need something lighter like a JQuery widget.
[17:56:28] <Alex8532> Or library
[17:56:59] <Alex8532> *google=good
[17:57:04] <robertmaxrees> selectize might be a good option.
[17:57:13] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js
[17:57:16] * Alex8532 looks up selectize
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> select2 also has an option for that.
[17:57:51] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i gotta go. enjoy :)
[18:00:52] <Alex8532> He left.
[18:01:06] <Alex8532> Still thanks.
[18:01:14] <Alex8532> Later!
