[04:58:55] <funkt> Hi there I am after finding something in jQuery where I could for example create a toggle box several times but only changing one number of the id that I am using as the hook. Instead of me writing say 10 different scripts is there a way I can use the same one but add a sort of loop 1++ to the code or a wild card option?
[05:26:59] <zagaza-> hey guys, how do you normally draw SVG stuff like this? is there some app for doing it, or do you actually gotta code everything by hand? http://www.research.ibm.com/green-horizons/interactive/
[05:28:25] <arc_> zagaza- vector graphics application like adobe illustrator
[05:28:42] <arc_> there really is no viable alternative to illustrator but some people will try to say inkscape is
[05:28:57] <zagaza-> how does the process roughly go though?
[05:29:03] <zagaza-> you draw each frame by hand?
[05:29:26] <arc_> well, no. the animation is something else entirely
[05:29:31] <arc_> i thought you were referring to the artwork
[05:29:54] <zagaza-> well both I guess, bad question sry
[05:30:08] <zagaza-> I saw those <svg> path stuff in the markup so I thought maybe they did everything by hand
[05:30:18] <arc_> nah that's generated
[05:30:30] <zagaza-> but if you do the artwork in illustrator, and then export it, then you use js to manipulate it manually?
[05:30:59] <zagaza-> for the animation
[05:31:30] <arc_> that's one possibility. i suppose i don't know what is typically done, but i believe adobe has an animation application now that isn't flash
[05:32:13] <zagaza-> hey!
[05:32:14] <zagaza-> https://www.google.com/webdesigner/
[05:32:15] <zagaza-> I saw this just now
[05:32:21] <zagaza-> this might be exactly what I'm looking for
[05:32:32] <arc_> looks like it
[06:02:57] <koosha> How can I check for a particular custom HTTP header in my AJAX response? (in ajax() or post())
[06:09:20] <shoky> koosha: $.ajax().done(data, status, xhr) { ... xhr.getResponseHeader('my-header') ... })
[06:10:07] <koosha> shoky: thanks, will look through the documentation
[08:26:42] <iamkhush> Hello all, Im working with react, and using jquery for ajax.  I am trying to run an ajax after running another ajax. and after each ajax I am calling  setState.  the flow starts in componentDidMount, in which I pass the url for ajax and the instance this. However, it seems that second ajax is running( as I can see in browser's network tab) but the console.log doesnt come and also the second setState is not being called.ts quite w
[08:26:43] <iamkhush> eird.  http://pastebin.com/EiSkX5PS
[08:35:35] <shoky> iamkhush: why are you passing `that` to $.get ?  (line 46)
[08:36:00] <shoky> you can just use .bind(this) on all your functions btw
[08:36:14] <shoky> or use arrow functions
[08:37:38] <iamkhush> shoky, i think that serves the same purpose
[08:39:31] <shoky> iamkhush: right but it's less confusing. also for your jquery ajax stuff you can do stuff line  function doAjax() { return $.get('url').done(function(result) { ... }); }     ...   doAjax().done(function(){ .. });
[08:39:42] <shoky> iamkhush: and still, passing that in line 46 is wrong
[08:41:30] <iamkhush> shoky, ok, that will be a good approach.
[08:41:41] <iamkhush> Ill try that will update in some time.
[08:42:01] <iamkhush> feel tired after stuck on this for some time. Will go out and have some fresh air :)
[08:42:24] <shoky> that's a good approach as well ;p
[09:13:10] <nsh> how do the equivalent in jquery of: blah = document.getElementByClassName('foo'); for(i=0;i<blah.length;i++) blah[i].click()
[09:13:10] <nsh> ?
[09:15:11] <nsh> oh, $(.foo).filter('button').click() maybe worked
[09:31:07] <socalocalilal> Yo yo yo. I have a control, which is basically a timeline selector. I have 24hours as 15min chunks
[09:31:37] <socalocalilal> I am using jquiery resizeable over a div in order to allow the user to select different time ranges (for a booking)
[09:32:06] <socalocalilal> I am doing this based on certain assumptions. That a 15 min chunk is (x) pixels wide, and by then inferring the time range selected based off that
[09:32:10] <socalocalilal> Is there a better way ?
[11:17:29] <clevodearia> jQuery's .html() method returns the html of the first matched element. I'm trying to figure a way to return the html of all matched elements combined, either as a string or as an array.
[11:17:40] <clevodearia> Is it possible to return data from within the .each() method?
[11:19:44] <Uhkis> just add to a variable defined before the each
[12:42:54] <callumacrae> Hey! I'm a little confused by the API documentation
[12:42:54] <callumacrae> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:43:25] <callumacrae> Where it says .filter(elements), typeof Element, how can it have that type if you can have more than one of them?
[12:46:22] <shoky> callumacrae: that's a mistake in the docs, it should be Element or array of Element
[12:48:03] <callumacrae> So $('a, b, c, d').filter(document.querySelectorAll('b, c, e')) would be expected to return b and c?
[12:49:44] <shoky> callumacrae: yes. though that's not strictly an array
[12:58:26] <callumacrae> cool. doesn't it work with nodelists? that would seem logical
[13:11:24] <shoky> it happens to, but there's lotsa stuff that works with arrays but doesn't work with nodelists. anyway i hope that's just for learning and you're not actually doing that ;p
[13:11:35] <shoky> callumacrae ^
[13:12:35] <callumacrae> It is for learning. But what's wrong with it?
[13:32:58] <SpecialTechnique> shoky: I think I narrowed it down to a question. I have an onclick="$('.media').click();" is there a way to target only whats in the parent div rather than all elements named .media?
[13:37:04] <SpecialTechnique> Obv
[13:38:35] <SpecialTechnique> The onclick="" portion isn't entirely correct, but that's what the onclick="" does in the end - just basically clicks another element. My issue is that it opens all of the same elements named .media rather than just the .media within the parent div.
[13:38:36] <shoky> SpecialTechnique: don't use onclick, use regular jquery .on() or .click()
[13:39:03] <SpecialTechnique> It's only for a test. I don't want to fully build it out before I test something.
[13:39:15] <shoky> SpecialTechnique:  $(this).closest('.containerClass').find('.media')
[13:39:53] <SpecialTechnique> would that actually work within onclick=" "? I had tried using a $(this) statement and it was failing. Maybe just had the logic wrong ;\
[13:40:03] <shoky> why are you asking about onclick?
[13:40:30] <shoky> iirc $(this) should work, anyways
[13:40:36] <SpecialTechnique> cause I'm only testing through tamper monkey. And my clone(true); is just not working.
[13:40:57] <shoky> then you're doing something else wrong
[13:41:10] <SpecialTechnique> I think it's just how the ajax was built out.
[13:41:17] <shoky> ok.
[13:41:26] <SpecialTechnique> I did not do it, I'm on board to UX/UI purposes lol
[13:41:38] <shoky> collective you.
[13:41:41] <shoky> who cares
[13:42:40] <SpecialTechnique> Thanks though!
[13:43:26] <shoky> np. make a jsfiddle and we can try to fix your issue
[13:43:32] <shoky> if you still have one
[13:44:42] <shoky> a jsfiddle showing the problem*
[13:45:34] <SpecialTechnique> Yea I tried doing so yesterday, but it was just a lot of code and I found that doing onclick was just much faster to just test some UI stuff lol - although, I did note to the dev team that my clone(true) was not working, so we'll see lol
[13:45:53] <shoky> :S
[13:46:55] <SpecialTechnique> So do you like dev all week too? :D
[13:47:24] <shoky> i should, but am too lazy :|
[13:49:38] <shoky> callumacrae: sorry didnt notice your last q. it's not wrong per se but there's no reason to use document.qSA if you're already using jquery.  $().filter('b,c,e')  or $().filter( someJqObject )  works just as good
[14:41:29] <gavroche> Can I my own function to catch $.ajax error?
[14:42:06] <gavroche> instead of error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
[14:42:06] <gavroche>         console.log("error:" + textStatus+' | '+errorThrown);
[14:42:06] <gavroche>         console.log("response:" + jqXHR.responseText);}
[14:42:40] <gavroche> to have error: myFunction (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) ?
[14:43:52] <afidegnum> hello, pls can you help with a hint? i m trying to implement a dynamic dropdown menu, where once the first menu is selected, it will display it's children menu, I have a chain of 4 dropddowns here, actually the dropbox is triggered but doesn't output values, here is my  script,
[14:43:54] <afidegnum> https://github.com/afidegnum/gsam/blob/master/project/static/dynamic.js
[15:47:12] <afidegnum> any insight?
[16:07:39] <asanyal> I had a quick question
[16:08:11] <asanyal> I was trying to import a navigation bar (written as a <nav> </nav> in a separate html file
[16:08:23] <asanyal> i have to include it across the board for 5 separate web pages
[16:08:50] <asanyal> i tried this : <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js">
[16:08:52] <asanyal> $(document).ready(function(){
[16:08:55] <asanyal> $('#navigation').load('navi.html');
[16:08:57] <asanyal> });
[16:08:58] <asanyal> </script>
[16:09:00] <asanyal> it did not work
[16:09:17] <asanyal> i guess '#navigation' is something else when i have to load it dynamically by jQuery
[16:10:15] <arc_> can you have both an external script and inline script in the same script tag?
[16:10:26] <arc_> i've never seen that before
[16:12:43] <arc_> src This attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a document. If a script element has a src attribute specified, it should not have a script embedded inside its tags.
[16:12:47] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script
[16:14:57] <asanyal> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25086979/loading-navigation-bar-into-html-page-with-jquery
[16:14:57] <asanyal> i got this answer from a stack overflow link
[16:14:57] <asanyal> i think it means load the jQuery CDN and then run the inline command at document load
[16:14:57] <asanyal> not sure, i am new to javascript
[16:14:57] <asanyal> its not a necessity, i just want the navi.html to be shared across all files (via some jQuery inclusion code)
[16:16:33] <arc_> asanyal well, try separating the jquery include from the inline script
[16:16:41] <arc_> what does your javascript console say?
[16:16:53] <arc_> wow, fucking freenode
[16:18:17] <arc_> btw is this your SO question?
[16:18:30] <arc_> no, must not be
[16:19:09] <arc_> so the script should be in <head>
[16:19:25] <arc_> and i assume you have a div with id navigation?
[16:19:44] <asanyal> yea
[16:19:53] <asanyal> its in the head
[16:20:08] <asanyal> ok i will separate and try
[16:20:13] <arc_> k
[16:20:19] <arc_> if it still doesn't work, look in your console
[16:31:44] <asanyal> got it to work
[16:31:47] <asanyal>  thanks
[16:31:53] <asanyal> yeah it was the inlining which was causing a problem
[16:32:09] <asanyal> i debugged it using webstrom, it was in some indefinite cdn load
[16:32:20] <asanyal> thanks
[16:33:15] <asanyal> thanks arc
[16:35:41] <arc_> you're welcome

[20:01:12] <afidegnum> any insight please?
[20:12:54] <afidegnum> how can i dump values into option list? is this correct ?             $("#district_select").append(              $("<option></option>").attr("value", option_list[i][0]).text(option_list[i][1]));
