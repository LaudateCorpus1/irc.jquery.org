[00:58:00] <Amirh> hi
[00:59:26] <Amirh> I have a problem, a box hides and shows with a timeout, after that I coded to load elements on neighbor boxes which has new positions. but the new element appears related to older positions on of the neighbor boxes.
[01:00:00] <Amirh> what should I do to make it work with new coordination of webpart?
[01:00:08] <Amirh> webparts*
[01:02:09] <Amirh> help please
[01:04:15] <Amirh> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7773952/
[01:05:30] <Darkingz> Amirh: did that happen after the post?
[01:06:01] <Amirh> Darkingz: doesn't matter, anywhere in this function after the hide or show
[01:06:26] <Amirh> I want to reload the menu of each box
[01:06:41] <Amirh> after a show or a hide, but menus load based on older places.
[01:08:05] <Amirh> Darkingz: do you have any idea?
[01:08:35] <Darkingz> Amirh: i'm thinking that the classes are reseting?
[01:08:39] <Darkingz> thats what it sounds like
[01:09:10] <Amirh> Darkingz: what can I do then?
[01:09:38] <Darkingz> errrr.... e is the element
[01:09:44] <Darkingz> ?
[01:09:55] <Darkingz> oh nvm
[01:10:00] <Amirh> yeah
[01:10:03] <Darkingz> ##javascript has the answer
[01:10:39] <Amirh> lol
[02:13:04] <t4nk076> Hello guys, I need your help. I am trying to apply one of the passwordstrength function. Below password field I want to see strength of password. I did this really horrible, but works. I am newbie in javascript, jquery. https://gist.github.com/pyemkey/2e7cb6e0337ea81a3d2f
[02:13:33] <t4nk076> Anyone can help me clean up this code, write in better way
[02:14:44] <systemfault> t4nk076: step 1, var passwordStrength = $('.password-strength’); and use that variable everywhere
[02:14:54] <systemfault> instead of always selecting
[02:15:31] <systemfault> t4nk076: 2) You don’t need to wrap the HTML with $(html) before passing it to .append
[02:16:36] <Darkingz> why not just add the lvl-1, etc. classes?
[02:16:41] <Darkingz> and remove them?
[02:17:32] <arthurvr> Caching your selector in a variable is maybe one of the first things you need to do.
[02:19:45] <gnu_d> Hi, what can be used for xmlHtppRequest in order to be the same as using jquery ajax crossDomain: true ?
[02:20:27] <gnu_d> cause I got few times when I need to use xmlHtppRequest instead of the jquery ajax request, but they both need to be the same
[02:21:06] <systemfault> gnu_d: What if… I told you that crossdomain: true makes jquery not use XHR at all? ;)
[02:21:34] <systemfault> gnu_d: Do you know what JSONP is?
[02:21:43] <gnu_d> systemfault: yes
[02:21:54] <systemfault> You understand it doesn’t use XHR, then?
[02:22:17] <t4nk076> Darkingz: Can you write in more detail what you mean
[02:22:35] <t4nk076> as I said I am pretty new in js world
[02:22:38] <systemfault> JSONP is an ugly hack, you’re not loading JSON but… JS using a dynamically created <script> tag.
[02:23:05] <Darkingz> well instead of writing out the entire append(<div class="lvl-1">); you can just add a class simply
[02:23:21] <Darkingz> and remove classes as nessessary
[02:23:31] <Darkingz> heck you can make a function that will do that for you
[02:24:35] <Darkingz> though to be fair,  i'd probably just either use a strength bar instead
[02:24:48] <Darkingz> or change the words
[02:48:23] <DerVorlone> hi. i have a question, example here http://jsfiddle.net/3Te3Z/
[02:48:28] <DerVorlone> this example only works with jquery-migrate-1.1.0.min.js
[02:48:35] <DerVorlone> why doesn't it work only with jquery-1.11.1.js or jquery2.x, i thought jquery-migrate-1.1.0.min.js is only for jquery 1.9
[02:49:17] <systemfault> DerVorlone: You don’t want .attr to check if a checkbox is checked, you want .prop
[02:50:26] <systemfault> So, if you change the 2 .attr to .prop, it should work the way you want.
[02:50:47] <DerVorlone> ok i check it
[02:56:29] <HowardwLo> is it strange, then when I have an ajax request replace a part of my dom on success, which includes a socialReload(); function to rerender twitter/fb social media buttons, that it wont render on the first jax request, but it works fine on teh second and identicle request?
[03:15:59] <pyemkey> Can anyone tell me how can I manage each div separately. For example I have parent div and inside 4 children div. How can I manage each?
[03:20:23] <puchacz> hi, can I have a global ajax listener? I wanted to put MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset",MathJax.Hub]); on every new content appearing
[03:58:27] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey: $('div').children().each(function() { $(this).doSomething(); })
[03:59:56] <lexmihaylov> puchacz: http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/ There is a global event section
[04:02:06] <pyemkey> lexmihaylov: I will show you what I prepared. https://gist.github.com/pyemkey/2e7cb6e0337ea81a3d2f . You can see my first version in first file and 2nd in the last file.
[04:02:25] <pyemkey> but it still doesn't look and work as I expected
[04:02:57] <pyemkey> I have to put some boundaries there
[04:03:37] <pyemkey> any suggestions how can I write this in javascript/jquery way
[04:08:14] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey: i don't understand what your exact problem is
[04:08:49] <lexmihaylov> and what you want to achieve
[04:13:37] <pyemkey> I have password input. I want to apply one of the passwordStrength script. Below password input I am planning to display password strength bar. On the right side should be also tooltip with message (weak, medium, strong, very strong)
[04:13:50] <pyemkey> I will try to upload this on jsfiddle
[04:14:55] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey, shouldn't $('.password-strength').append($(record)); be outside of the for loop ?
[04:17:28] <pyemkey> lexmihaylov:You are absolutely right. That's a reason why my function doesn't work as I expected.
[04:17:43] <pyemkey> One problem was solved
[04:20:57] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey, what is your other problem?
[04:22:03] <pyemkey> I need to hide tooltip, before user start typing password.
[04:22:20] <pyemkey> I've tried to use inline style display none
[04:22:27] <pyemkey> but it doesn't work
[04:24:58] <lexmihaylov> how are you hiding the tooltip, can you show me some code?
[04:28:36] <pyemkey> lexmihaylov: https://gist.github.com/pyemkey/2e7cb6e0337ea81a3d2f
[04:28:46] <pyemkey> The last file contain tooltip code
[04:30:50] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey: you want to hide the tooltip while the user is typing ?
[04:31:43] <pyemkey> I want to hide this tooltip before user start type password
[04:32:05] <pyemkey> I shouldn't see this toolbar after refresh the page
[04:32:11] <pyemkey> I hope you know what I mean
[04:35:08] <lexmihaylov> hmm try something like $(pass_field).one('keydown', function() {// hide tooltip});
[04:38:59] <pyemkey> lexmihaylov: I will try to describe how my password field and tooltip should looks like. User start type a password. In the same time when user type a password below he can see password strengh level and on the right should see a tooltip with information (weak medium strong very strong). I noticed that tooltip exist even if password field is empty.
[04:39:31] <pyemkey> If password field is empty I shouldn't see a password_strength bar and tooltip.
[04:40:22] <pyemkey> password_strength is not showing anymore, but tooltip is
[04:45:13] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey: now i understand. take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/79ajP/ Is this what you are looking for?
[04:45:50] <pyemkey> Ok, I solved this problem by using if condition where I am checking value of input. Depends of length I am using hide or show method.
[04:46:27] <pyemkey> ooo, I can see that you prepared similar solution.
[04:46:29] <pyemkey> Thank you
[04:47:35] <pyemkey> for your time. I hope one day when my skills will be better (programming and linguistic) i will help people to solve a problems.
[04:53:41] <lexmihaylov> pyemkey: good luck :)
[04:54:45] <pyemkey> lexmihaylov: thanks, btw can you recommend good resources to learn javascript/ jquery. How your path looked like?
[04:55:40] <arthurvr> pyemkey: learn.jquery.com
[04:55:48] <Nubville> so I have 9 boxes that i'm using math.max to check which has box is the tallest, and adjust them all to that height to keep them all floated in the right place, but now that the element has a set height I have a text overflow problem on resizing the window narrower, is there a good way to measure the height of all the children elements of a particular element?
[05:28:22] <Dondee> Hello
[05:38:36] <Dondee> Anyone that can help with some jquery / jquery-ui?
[05:38:41] <Nubville> http://pastebin.com/MX5EMz4B Can anyone tell me why this might not working? as I'm resizing the window i'm still getting text overflow from the div's i'm checking the largest height of, and adding together the height of all the children elements as well and comparing them
[05:43:24] <callumacrae> This code is referring to $(e.currentTarget) and $(this). Aren't they the same thing?
[05:43:35] <callumacrae> event is handled by jQuery
[05:48:35] <Dondee> I have a button that creates a new div (a blue 100x100 box). How can I do so each box gets their own number?. The number should be incrementing.
[05:48:47] <Dondee> Like. The first box gets the number 1, next box 2, third box 3
[05:51:21] <munnis> Hi, why doesn't the first hover_cust div become visible when hovering the black box? http://jsfiddle.net/5ghUJ/2/
[05:55:31] <munnis> http://jsfiddle.net/5ghUJ/4/
[05:55:33] <munnis> corrections
[05:55:39] <munnis> still does not work, removed typo's
[05:59:22] <munnis> this channel used to be alive :D
[06:02:31] <Nubville> munnis: I'm not very good at this but I dont see any spans in your html to find?
[06:02:54] <munnis> see the correction
[06:03:30] <munnis> http://jsfiddle.net/Wg2xv/
[06:03:34] <munnis> this is the updated version
[06:03:39] <munnis> however, the div never hides
[06:10:41] <Nubville> munnis: is it cause the first div it finds doesn't have a class of hover_cust?
[06:14:27] <eigentor> Here is a little script I wrote which changes the value of a numeric input field with a plus and minus button http://pastebin.com/JevuyZ6W
[06:14:42] <eigentor> Now the problem is, the changing only starts on the second click
[06:14:58] <eigentor> So when I click plus or minus for the first time, nothing happens
[06:16:07] <Dondee> eigentor. try put console log after your click function
[06:16:25] <eigentor> well yeah this gives me the number
[06:16:33] <BillCriswell> eigentor: Open your console and type var foo = 0; then type foo++, you'll see foo still returns 0.
[06:16:34] <eigentor> you mean after?
[06:16:42] <BillCriswell> If you type foo again then it'll be 1.
[06:16:50] <BillCriswell> You need to do ++foo
[06:16:58] <eigentor> ah!
[06:17:41] <eigentor> BillCriswell: great! that worked
[06:17:48] <BillCriswell> eigentor: Sweeeet.
[06:18:01] <eigentor> I'll have to read up to understand that
[06:18:16] <BillCriswell> eigentor: I have no idea what that's called in programming words haha.
[06:19:43] <eigentor> pre-increment and post-increment
[06:20:23] <BillCriswell> There you go.
[06:20:41] <eigentor> I would have wondered for hours
[06:20:50] <eigentor> Going to the channel often pays off
[06:21:01] <Dondee> I have this function that appends a div.. and it works.
[06:21:18] <Dondee> but I want to write incrementing numbers inside each div aswell.
[06:21:28] <Dondee> like the first box gets 1, second box gets 2, and so on
[06:21:29] <Dondee> http://jsfiddle.net/89gUQ/
[06:21:33] <Dondee> any ideas?
[06:22:49] <StephenS> codeine in my system
[06:23:11] <eigentor> bye and thanks
[06:27:04] <dbt_> @Dondee - $('body').append("<div class='appendDiv' id="+newDiv+"><p id='pCount'></p>"+divCount+"</div>");
[06:27:53] <dbt_> you just needed to escape the string to add the variable value
[06:29:50] <Dondee> oohhh so that's how you do it..
[06:29:59] <Dondee> finally working.
[06:29:59] <dbt_> yup
[06:30:26] <dbt_> theres a couple other variables needing brought out of the string as well but thats the way
[06:31:15] <Dondee> only newDiv that needs to get out of string aswell I believe?
[06:31:54] <Dondee> no wait.. I'm not thinking clearly atm
[06:35:05] <Dondee> Been struggling to find a solution for some hours. thx dbt_
[06:35:26] <Dondee> but you said there was other variables needing to be brought out aswell?
[06:39:42] <Dondee> Ah. I got it. was the "newDiv" afterall
[06:54:38] <frank_o> Hi! Is it possible to put a global jQuery function (`$.fn.MyFunction = function()`) inside an anonymous function (`var MyWrapper = function()`) and still have it act as a global function?
[06:56:44] <frank_o> I usually put different functionalities inside anonymous functions for cleanliness. In this case the global function requires a few variables that are found inside the anonymous function.
[06:57:56] <BillCriswell> frank_o: $.fn.MyFunction = whatever; would be available wherever after the function housing it executes.
[06:58:09] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Awesome!
[06:58:54] <BillCriswell> Would be a little safer using jQuery.fn.MyFunction just incase something jacks $.
[06:59:24] <frank_o> So it shall be!
[06:59:32] <frank_o> Cheerio Bill :wink:
[06:59:42] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:21:56] <PrasanthG> Hello there
[07:22:16] <dbt_> Hello anywhere
[07:22:27] <Lev_> Hello here
[07:22:29] <PrasanthG> :)
[07:22:49] <PrasanthG> Is anyone aware of this jquery feature http://www.little-big-room.com/
[07:23:27] <PrasanthG> i need that similar effect in the home page after loading
[07:23:51] <PrasanthG> It was a jquery horizontal slider with nice effect
[07:30:30] <PrasanthG> any such jquery plugins?
[07:34:28] <decx> a plugin will never give you the control you need to pull something like this off
[07:36:21] <PrasanthG> oh
[07:36:48] <decx> revolution slider maybe
[07:37:14] <decx> if you have the 16$ ;)
[07:37:15] <PrasanthG> will take a look
[07:37:19] <PrasanthG> ooh
[07:43:24] <frank_o> How do I pass `myContainer` as an argument to a global jQuery function? I did `$.fn.someFunction = function(myContainer)` and then later $('.my_container').someFunction(); but I'm getting undefined for `myContainer`.
[07:43:28] <frank_o> Before going global I did `function someFunction(myContainer)` and then later `someFunction('.my_container')` which worked fine.
[07:48:31] <BillCriswell> frank_o: $('.my_container').someFunction() is what I think you're looking for?
[07:49:20] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Actually nevermind. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6960448/global-jquery-function told me to do it like $('.my_container').someFunction() but actually I think it's supposed to be $.fn.someFunction('.my_container')
[07:49:49] <BillCriswell> frank_o: That looks very un-jQuery.
[07:50:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone using gulp-ruby-sass?
[07:51:24] <frank_o> ecky--ptang-zoob: I'm waiting for https://github.com/d-i/half-pipe/ to mature
[07:51:58] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: I just use libsass.
[08:04:20] <catcher> I know lightboxing isn't the most mobile-friendly thing, but are any plugins standing out these days?  Need it to handle playing youtube videos.
[08:07:12] <decx> let the app handle it
[08:07:26] <decx> link to youtube, youtube app opens
[08:09:33] <catcher> decx, I'm hoping for a solution that will work on desktop as well, without sending people away from the page.
[08:13:38] <decx> i have a lightbox style thing on desktop and ignore that for the direct link that opens the app on mobile
[08:14:28] <catcher> decx, so you run a mobile detection script then?
[08:15:15] <decx> yes
[08:18:01] <BillCriswell> I need to get more comfortable in the terminal.
[08:18:29] <saony> how can I group selector like this :: $([s,i,t]).attr('required', true);
[08:18:37] <saony> s,i,t there are vars
[08:18:48] <BillCriswell> Just found out I could do mkdir -p /foo/{sub,anothersub,more}
[08:18:50] <BillCriswell> What a noob.
[08:19:16] <BillCriswell> What type of variables saony.
[08:19:36] <saony> example var s = $("form select");
[08:19:53] <saony> var i = $("form input[type='text']");
[08:19:58] <saony> ...
[08:20:27] <decx> var all = s.add(i).add(t)
[08:20:44] <BillCriswell> saony: I know for certain you can do s.add(i).add(t).foo(), but I feel like your way should work?
[08:21:11] <duch_kazatel> .add() always felt awkward to me.
[08:21:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Agreed.
[08:21:35] <decx> it's also slow
[08:21:50] <decx> extending an object takes time
[08:23:24] <saony> Ok
[08:23:28] <duch_kazatel> why doesn't $theThings.add('.somethingElse'); actually modify $theThings permanently?  always wondered that.
[08:23:31] <saony> well advice!
[08:23:42] <saony> tkz
[08:25:18] <decx> add thinks slice is cooler than splice
[08:25:55] <BillCriswell> You can do $([el, el2, el3]) but not $([$el, $el2, $el3])
[08:27:58] <saony> ok
[08:28:15] <_2_Maria> hi:)
[08:28:25] <decx> interesting
[08:28:44] <_2_Maria> How old are u
[08:28:47] <decx> so [s[0],i[0],t[0]]
[08:28:56] <duch_kazatel> wat
[08:29:07] <duch_kazatel> oh we have a bot.
[08:29:33] <_2_Maria> am new to all these:O
[08:31:33] <w00tb3ast> Quick question, if I want to loop through a set of divs and then change their background css like every 3 seconds, without using a plugin what is the best function to use? something like $('element').each with a delay after changing the css?
[08:31:51] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast why do you need to loop through the elements?
[08:32:00] <duch_kazatel> you can just do $('.theClass').css()
[08:32:49] <duch_kazatel> you can use setInterval() to do the timer part
[08:33:16] <_2_Maria> what yr real name
[08:33:18] <w00tb3ast> so the basic structure is that there is a container with 5 div's inside it, each div has a data-bg attribute that I am applying to the body, I basically want to use that data-bg attribute from each element once every 60 seconds
[08:34:36] <w00tb3ast> setInterval seems like a good place to start, thanks duch_kazatel
[08:35:00] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast sure.
[08:36:37] <decx> use settimeout in a requestanimation frame or css3
[08:36:47] <decx> requestAnimationFrame
[08:45:08] <djQuery_> car I not do var x = [10] to create an array with a length of 10? var x = []; x[10] = ''; works however
[08:45:23] <duch_kazatel> [10] is an array with one object.
[08:45:40] <duch_kazatel> x[10] creates the 10th index in array x.
[08:46:00] <djQuery_> well 11 rather
[08:46:23] <duch_kazatel> *10th index.  the array will have 11 things in it ;)
[08:47:12] <djQuery_> theres gotta be some way to clean up this while loop http://jsbin.com/venom/1/edit
[08:47:17] <decx> that's gotta be a whole lotta undefined
[08:48:07] <djQuery_> decx, x represents a game board for minesweeper
[08:51:22] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ looks like what you really want is a plain old object here.
[08:51:45] <duch_kazatel> why does msweep need to be an array?
[08:52:12] <djQuery_> gues it doesnt
[08:52:32] <duch_kazatel> that's not necessarily going to fix your problem, but it seems kind of awkward to me.
[08:53:14] <duch_kazatel> you'll still need to check if properties exist, though you could just msweep[x] = {}; without actually checking first.
[08:59:18] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, thats better look at it now. http://jsbin.com/venom/1/edit
[08:59:59] <duch_kazatel> sure why not.  stimight want to ditch your var msweep = []; earlier on.
[09:01:58] <djQuery_> duch_kazatel, changed it to just var msweep
[09:02:32] <decx> table -.-
[09:03:29] <decx> i know it seems easier at first to have an automatic layout, but having a clear set of coordinates for everything will be beneficial in the long run. be it with svg or canvas
[09:03:43] <duch_kazatel> decx looooves svg and canvas :)
[09:04:16] <decx> it's just so innefficient to get the cell that is above or under another one with a table
[09:04:22] <decx> when you just need coordinates
[09:04:22] <duch_kazatel> that's very true
[09:13:22] <djQuery_> decx, havent worked with svg or canvas at all
[09:13:56] <djQuery_> it would be more eficeint getting the td if I had actualy looped through and given them ids I gues
[09:15:26] <djQuery_> decx, would you have been happier if I used divs and spans instead of tr and td
[09:16:06] <Ownix> I have multiple Jquery dialogs that are identified and initialized by the same classname  $('.dialogs').dialog({autoOpen:false}); // Init 30 dialogs
[09:16:15] <Ownix> And I need to identify which one to init http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/5tu6g/
[09:16:55] <Ownix> The problem is the dialogs arent hidden they are removed from the DOM, so I cant say $('li').children('.dialogs').dialog('open');
[09:17:32] <djQuery_> Ownix, <li data-dialogid="d1">
[09:17:49] <duch_kazatel> Ownix you'll need to create some kind of unique ID for each one.
[09:18:15] <djQuery_> Ownix, OR don't create the dialogs at all
[09:18:39] <djQuery_> Ownix, give the li some data property that says what to put in the dialog
[09:19:02] <Ownix> ohhh and then create it on demand. Well I want to use HTMl in the dialog
[09:23:59] <supsup> question:  is there a way to add a new class to an existing selector so it inherits that selectors events?
[09:24:47] <Ownix> djQuery_: this is my working solution, but it required putting data-dialogid on both the LI and the dialog element. http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/5tu6g/1/
[09:24:48] <duch_kazatel> no, but you could use event delegation instead and watch for elements with a certain class.
[09:24:51] <Ownix> Is there a cleaner way?
[09:25:31] <djQuery_> Ownix, <div id="d2" class="dialog" title="Dialog 2"><p>This is dialog 2</p></div>
[09:26:47] <djQuery_> Ownix, var selectedDialog = dialogs.filter(options.$trigger.data("dialogid"));
[09:27:37] <MikeD_> on this page: http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/135659 the scroll behavior moves the primary topnav off screen, but secondary remains fixed and the highlight moves down the nav... what's that technique/motif called?
[09:29:10] <djQuery_> Ownix, forgot the # var selectedDialog = dialogs.filter('#' + options.$trigger.data("dialogid"))
[09:30:09] <decx> djQuery_ just because you'Ve never done anything with canvas or svg doesnt mean you cant start
[09:30:14] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ can't remember, but bootstrap does that.
[09:30:20] <decx> believe me it's more appropriate
[09:30:31] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: that explains it lol http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/5tu6g/3/
[09:30:42] <Ownix> So the filter doesnt take a function I guess?
[09:30:43] <MikeD_> what's the secret sauce to make it work?  do you know?
[09:30:45] <decx> and in the end you learn performance stuff that you can apply to your normal work
[09:30:54] <Ownix> Or it can either take a function or something else?
[09:30:57] <djQuery_> http://jsfiddle.net/5tu6g/4/
[09:31:14] <djQuery_> Ownix, it can take a function or it can take a selector
[09:31:25] <djQuery_> taking an id selector is faster of course
[09:31:34] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ check out their site: http://getbootstrap.com/css/ :)
[09:31:35] <djQuery_> Ownix, your way still worked
[09:31:37] <Ownix> ah
[09:32:15] <MikeD_> thanks
[09:32:21] <djQuery_> Ownix, if you have lotsa objects the filter by the data attribute is gonna be slow
[09:32:35] <djQuery_> and I think the selector is easier to read personaly
[09:32:49] <Ownix> same here
[09:33:02] <Ownix> I never liked passing functions around, but then again I come from a C# BG
[09:33:22] <djQuery_> Ownix, is the text of the HTML going to be the same for each one?
[09:33:36] <djQuery_> ie somethign like are you sure you want to delete this one or something
[09:33:52] <djQuery_> Ar you sure you want to delete tom?
[09:34:50] <Ownix> djQuery_: im working on a dropbox style system for my company, just for a small amount of internal files uploaded by staff. The data for the dialogs is generated by ASP.NET Razor.
[09:35:14] <Ownix> So there will be <table> inside the dialogs, with data from a database
[09:35:35] <Ownix> I see what youre asking, if it was just a delete confirmation I wouldnt need to create a dialog for each LI
[09:36:15] <djQuery_> Ownix, you never know on here
[09:36:35] <antlong> I would like to run $("#someDiv").tsort() when the contents have changed, how can I do that?
[09:37:12] <djQuery_> antlong, how is the data being put into it?
[09:37:23] <djQuery_> antlong, and there are a ton of sorting plugins
[09:37:40] <Ownix> And im sure I could create a single dialog, and then populate the body on the fly with jquery but it comes down to which is easier. Create the dialogs that are ready to go out of the box with Razor and then tell them to open on demand, or have a metric ton of data-* attributes on the <li> and scrape them with Jquery then build a dialog on demand each time
[09:37:44] <MikeD_> or are you asking how to detect that the contents have changed?
[09:37:46] <antlong> i'm using tsort, djQuery_ , I'm just wondering how to incorporate it in to an event listener
[09:37:57] <antlong> MikeD_ yes
[09:39:01] <MikeD_> antlong: djQuery_ question is still pretty important, how is the data changing?
[09:39:31] <antlong> MikeD_ you click a button, and it inserts elements in to the html basically
[09:39:45] <antlong> MikeD_ the button runs a function that could return elements or nothing
[09:40:23] <antlong> i read that 'DOMSubtreeModified'  is deprecated, is that accurate
[09:40:58] <MikeD_> you could either run your sort on that same function, or if you are going to have another/multiple ways... you could have the button(s) trigger an event that the parent is listening for
[09:41:01] <duch_kazatel> antlong that's a dangerous event to use.
[09:41:24] <djQuery_> antlong, then just make it part of that button click to resort the data, or better yet sort the data before adding it
[09:41:43] <antlong> ok, yeah I can add it to the function that returns the data
[09:41:47] <MikeD_> yeah, or add it into an already sorted list
[09:41:58] <MikeD_> .. in the correct place
[09:57:11] <djQuery_> antlong, or take a look at something like angluar
[09:57:18] <Guest43914> Hello, I am a first time jQuery user here. Trying to create a dropdown menu for my nav bar. here is what I have - http://pastebin.com/HRdqzqUU     - Nothing drops down - I can link the site also this is a learning build nothing but this on site.
[09:57:36] <antlong> djQuery_ i will, but i remember last time i did thinking it was a little too advanced for me
[09:58:04] <djQuery_> antlong, well it depends on what your backend is anyways
[09:58:09] <antlong> there is none
[09:58:29] <djQuery_> antlong, static pages?
[09:58:42] <antlong> just an index.html and shit ton of JS
[09:59:02] <djQuery_> yeah then thats not gonna work for you
[10:01:29] <drej> Guest43914 looks like you might benefit from spending a bit more time understanding some html/css basics
[10:01:34] <drej> you dont need javascript for this for starters
[10:01:46] <drej> but then also your html is so far removed from what it should be that you're basically ramming a square peg into a round hole
[10:01:53] <drej> *giggidy
[10:02:25] <BillCriswell> How many "projects" do you guys typically have open at the same time?
[10:02:32] * Velveeta cannonballs into a pool in the middle of the room, then never surfaces.
[10:02:38] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, all of them
[10:02:40] <Guest43914> lol, idk if this helps but I an using codeigniter framework .
[10:03:38] <djQuery_> Guest22956, see ?jqueryui.menu
[10:03:48] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: So you have like all your projects open in different text editor windows, watches happening on all, etc
[10:03:56] <decx> i can have like 4 light projects, but one big project in focus is always preferable
[10:04:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, I'm like afraid to close some projects cause I know right after I close it and stop the watches and everything else I'm going to need to do something again.
[10:04:36] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, 3 monitors so yeah
[10:05:14] <decx> i always had that problem when i worked in agencys
[10:05:27] <decx> get work done 3 times faster than coworkers, do 3 9 times the work
[10:05:33] <decx> same pay
[10:05:48] <decx> not 3 9 only 9 ^^
[10:05:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Do you do your own thing now?
[10:06:00] <decx> for a few years
[10:06:15] <decx> now i can work 5 hours a month or 200
[10:06:34] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: I have 2, but I don't feel like it helps me focus on more than one thing at a time. I find too many windows distracting.
[10:06:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha nice.
[10:06:54] <decx> i hate the business part though
[10:07:28] <decx> cold calls, gettting new clients, taxshit
[10:07:30] <decx> ugh
[10:07:32] <Snacks> Guest43914: Do you know how to view the console.log?
[10:08:17] <Guest43914> Snacks: instpect element ?
[10:08:29] <Snacks> Guest43914: yes. Go here, and do that:
[10:08:30] <Snacks> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/
[10:08:37] <Velveeta> yeah, freelance work was always too erratic for me to try to make a persistent living with it
[10:08:50] <Guest43914> okay, thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
[10:08:55] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah. I'm bad at business haha
[10:09:01] <Velveeta> and if you're trying to do it on any of the popular freelance sites out there, you're gonna be working 60 hour weeks for peanuts to try to undercut bids from other countries
[10:09:09] <Snacks> Guest43914: First off, you needed # instead of . inyour selector. And, you had a misspelling in there (still do)
[10:09:18] <BillCriswell> Those freelance sites seem crazy to me.
[10:09:46] <Guest43914> Snacks: ah okay, not supprised thats usally 10% of my issues lol
[10:09:46] <decx> yeah that doesnt make sense Velveeta i cant compete with <50$/h
[10:09:57] <BillCriswell> I'm listening to an old George Carlin interview. This dude is so smart.
[10:10:11] <Velveeta> yeah, it's always something like "need a facebook clone, should work flawlessly in windows, osx, linux, ID4-alien spacecraft, and any unknown technologies that may arise.. need delivered in 7 days, max budget: $25"
[10:10:28] <Snacks> Guest43914: http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/1/ <- That has the spelling issue fixed. And now, keep using console.log to output more stuff until you understand what's going on
[10:10:33] <decx> and somebody will meet those demands
[10:10:34] <BillCriswell> There's people that respond to that shit. It's depressing.
[10:10:37] <Velveeta> right
[10:10:56] <Velveeta> then halfway through the project, they say "i know i said fb clone, but what i meant was bank of america"
[10:11:00] <Guest43914> Snacks: Will do thanks, that site is gonna be a HUGE help to so 2 birds and all.
[10:11:07] <djQuery_> Guest22956, http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[10:11:07] <decx> they are the ones who come in here with problems but don't have time for a fiddle right now
[10:11:15] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:11:19] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:11:31] <decx> in that light i can actually understand it
[10:11:32] <decx> ^^
[10:11:33] <djQuery_> Guest22956, or there a a ton of allready built nav\menu plugins
[10:11:58] <decx> i'm actually doing some print work right now
[10:12:08] <decx> it's so boring
[10:12:26] <decx> i can't animate anything -.-
[10:12:35] <djQuery_> Velveeta, Job opening needs 8 years experience with some tech that has only been out 3 months
[10:12:47] <Velveeta> lol, right
[10:13:02] <Guest43914> Trying to learn, and I do so best by jumping in. I thnk Snacks  just explaned a ton of things with his jsfiddle.
[10:13:43] <Velveeta> snacks typically work for me too
[10:13:47] <Snacks> :)
[10:13:48] <Velveeta> but i'm a fattie
[10:14:01] <Snacks> Guest43914: Update... with more console.log stuff: http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/2/
[10:14:41] <Guest43914> wow, your fast.
[10:14:47] <Velveeta> so i'm thinking of doing a presentation about dependency injection vs dependency inversion, and titling it "DI, DI, DI My Darling"
[10:14:52] <BillCriswell> Going to close this watch.
[10:15:24] <Snacks> Die, My Darling? You should just break up with her
[10:15:35] <decx> i hate presentations where the presenter is trying to be cute
[10:15:39] <Velveeta> relevance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDTqxn6KCNs
[10:15:52] <decx> only second the presentations with giant pictures of the presenter as the second slide
[10:16:00] <decx> i mean, come on i can see you already
[10:16:13] <Velveeta> decx: i just talked to those presentations, and they said they hate your face
[10:16:13] <decx> "this is me" - no shit
[10:16:21] <Velveeta> i don't know about you, but *i* personally wouldn't stand for that
[10:16:33] <decx> -.-
[10:17:14] <djQuery_> decx, well hopefully the slides live on after the presentation
[10:17:48] <decx> my photoshops of the presenter in a tutu certainly will
[10:19:10] <BillCriswell> What are yous talking about?
[10:19:22] <BillCriswell> Ugh, real life words just made it into IRC>
[10:19:30] <BillCriswell> What are you all talking about.
[10:19:31] <decx> obnoxious presentations
[10:19:34] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[10:19:54] <BillCriswell> I prefer slides.
[10:21:20] <BillCriswell> I'm going to do something this week I should have done when I first turned on a computer, get comfortable with bash
[10:21:55] <Snacks> does one every truly become comfortable with Bash?
[10:22:13] <MikeD_> "I prefer slides"  compared to swings, sure.
[10:22:25] <BillCriswell> Well... I'd like to understand the basics haha
[10:22:30] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Haha
[10:23:11] <djQuery_> ? why the heck does the column width get so big. http://jsbin.com/venom/1/edit    click start 1st
[10:23:29] <BillCriswell> "venom"
[10:23:31] <BillCriswell> Bas ass.
[10:24:27] <BillCriswell> Bad* even
[10:25:01] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: Any browser in particular? Seems to be doing what it should to me.
[10:25:11] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, chrome
[10:25:42] <Velveeta> i don't see any out of whack column width in chrome
[10:25:48] <BillCriswell> Yeah same.
[10:26:04] <BillCriswell> width: 100%; on the table, the tds are going to full up the tables width.
[10:26:08] <Velveeta> if i click into the first column i see it
[10:26:21] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, you can create one that says anthing you want
[10:26:50] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Ohhh
[10:26:51] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, http://jsbin.com/BillCriswell/1/edit
[10:27:04] <decx> should've used svg ^^
[10:27:15] <Guest43914> Snacks: I got to say I never found the spelling error lol
[10:27:36] <djQuery_> decx, then shoot me a tut
[10:27:51] <decx> d3.js
[10:28:13] <MikeD_> d3 looks awesome, have you used it for much?
[10:28:19] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: Might need to create those table cells with &nbsp; inside
[10:28:43] <decx> personally not, but a friend made a couple of nice interactive stuff with it
[10:28:49] <djQuery_> ssentially: it works everywhere except IE 8 and down and Android 2.3 and down.
[10:28:52] <decx> a couple of stuff, good lord
[10:29:02] <decx> i've been awake for too long
[10:29:40] <MikeD_> that was perfectly clear as far as I'm concerned
[10:29:48] <decx> just no
[10:31:37] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: This thing is getting on my nerves haha
[10:33:10] <Guest43914> How do i view errors in console ?
[10:33:25] <decx> i use my eyes
[10:33:48] <Guest43914> Lets assume im no were as awesome as you LOL
[10:33:51] <djQuery_> Guest22956, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:33:59] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: Got it.
[10:34:05] <decx> well you seem to know about the console
[10:34:09] <MikeD_> decx:  that's insensitive to the differently-sighted  (or is it sited?)  :p
[10:34:12] <decx> so open it up and log
[10:34:27] <decx> i guess you can use your fingers too if you have a braille output
[10:34:45] <MikeD_> "ew, that's a bug... no really, it's a BUG"
[10:35:13] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: http://jsbin.com/posuruxu/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:35:19] <BillCriswell> table-layout: fixed;
[10:36:06] <BillCriswell> Still needed &nbsp; in the table cells since the height was changing.
[10:37:24] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, thanks
[10:37:47] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, http://jsbin.com/BillCriswell/1/edit
[10:46:04] <djQuery_> sigh now how to check all around the one that was checked
[10:46:15] <evangeline_> hi
[10:46:24] <evangeline_> Does anybody know why this code doesn't want to execute: http://dpaste.com/0AFKZ7J : when I hover the services-test, the alert() message box is now shown?
[10:46:53] <duch_kazatel>  $('services-test') isn't a valid selector.
[10:46:58] <duch_kazatel> you want  $('#services-test')
[10:47:17] <djQuery_> evangeline_, and alert? realy
[10:47:30] <duch_kazatel> also use console.log() for testing things instead of alert.
[10:48:19] <djQuery_> evangeline_, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide15
[10:48:25] <decx> using console for the first time: http://i.imgur.com/SqfuGRz.gif
[10:48:40] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: I think I've done something like this before... totally forget where I left the code though.
[10:49:30] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, of course I can just add 1 and subtract one and see if its in my object but of course it needs to be recursive
[10:49:30] <evangeline_> duch_kazatel, yeah I'm using the right selector, I've made a mistake while copy-pasting
[10:49:41] <evangeline_> the console.log doesn't display anything
[10:49:55] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, dont work on it it was more me thinking out loud
[10:50:08] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: Haha got it
[10:50:33] <djQuery_> BillCriswell, gues it only needs to be recursive if it was completly blank with nothing around it
[10:51:06] <BillCriswell> djQuery_: I have no idea what were you trying to do I just had something that got all the cells around one.
[10:51:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6wSs6/
[10:51:12] <duch_kazatel> evangeline_ that works for me.
[10:51:18] <antlong> I have a problem with this plugin named Sieve, its a filter plugin and I'm using it on an accordion. It works well, but when you clear the input, its not resorting the accordion state. what do I do to get the state manually?
[10:51:20] <duch_kazatel> make sure you have your dev tools open.
[10:54:55] <djQuery_> antlong, http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#method-refresh
[10:56:06] <evangeline_> the chrome 'Inspect Element' is showing this erorr in console: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[10:56:29] <duch_kazatel> evangeline_ does it give you a particular line that's happening on?
[10:56:33] <jParkton> good catch?
[10:56:41] <jParkton> on the right
[10:56:48] <djQuery_> evangeline_, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8
[10:56:48] <jParkton> should be the file:numberline
[10:57:46] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Ever happen to hear of a band called "16 Horsepower"?

[11:05:34] <duch_kazatel> Guest22956 var matching_ul = $('ul ' + elem_class); does not do what you think it does ;)
[11:06:19] <duch_kazatel> err, Guest43914
[11:06:24] <Guest43914> nice
[11:06:52] <duch_kazatel> your selector is looking for $('ul login');
[11:07:05] <duch_kazatel> you want var matching_ul = $('ul.' + elem_class); instead
[11:07:44] <axilla> how can I change the opacity of a div onload based on a saved value in a database?

[11:09:53] <djQuery_> axilla, how is the div being rendered to the page? is it being added to the page after the page is initialy loaded?'
[11:09:58] <duch_kazatel> or don't build things that way ;)
[11:09:58] <AusME> Okay, so I seem to be having problems debugging ajax loaded scripts so it hit me. Is there really any benefit to an AJAX loaded script? Why not just conditionally include it server side based on URL or such?
[11:10:01] <Snacks> hate it when the wrong thing is on my clipboard...
[11:10:16] <duch_kazatel> AusME do that server-side.
[11:10:29] <duch_kazatel> AusME don't load scripts via ajax, imo.
[11:10:33] <AusME> Heh
[11:10:41] <Guest43914> DING, that was it ... along with several spelling errors Snacks  found
[11:10:43] <duch_kazatel> data is one thing, scripts are another.
[11:10:51] <Snacks> :)
[11:11:20] <Snacks> hmmmm. Just got off the phone with the first gatre keeper for a potential new job. Scary shit!
[11:11:32] <duch_kazatel> very nice.  what kind of company?
[11:12:15] <Snacks> a scary one: http://www.battelle.org/
[11:12:47] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[11:13:11] <Snacks> Battelle Wins $76 Million Chemical Demilitarization Contract at Kentucky Plant
[11:13:15] <Snacks> for that
[11:13:38] <Snacks> they are destroying old mustard gas weaponry
[11:14:07] <duch_kazatel> awesome.
[11:14:37] <Snacks> I hope the job comes with a gas mask and chemical suit
[11:14:45] <Snacks> if not, I'm ordering some
[11:14:52] <djQuery_> Career Opportunities: Cyber Network Engineer (15220)
[11:15:40] <Snacks> said I was almost overqualified. I take that as meaning, I'll get the best pay they can offer. And that's what I'll push for. :)
[11:15:55] <duch_kazatel> they'll still lowball you.  be aware ;)
[11:16:22] <djQuery_> Snacks, no no no that just means that you are on the list if they can't find anyone cheaper
[11:16:30] <Snacks> oh I know. But, I alreay have a great job/career, and I have no need to do a lateral move. If they want me, they have to make it sweet
[11:16:37] <djQuery_> remember it appears that they only do goverment contracts there
[11:16:59] <duch_kazatel> they do commercial, as well.
[11:17:33] <Snacks> yeah. But she also said they are doing the early hiring right now, and will be ramping up the hiring later this year. It sounds like I'm getting in early, and will be part of the core group. We'll see how it goes
[11:17:43] <duch_kazatel> that'd be neat.
[11:18:03] <decx> messing around is fun http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zPsre/1/
[11:18:25] <Snacks> neat
[11:18:31] <Snacks> now make me a fractal generator
[11:18:51] <decx> that involves too much thinking and lessing messing around ^^
[11:18:56] <decx> less*
[11:19:19] <Snacks> heh
[11:19:42] <Snacks> my first "goofing around" graphics program on a C64 was a Mandlebrot generator
[11:20:41] <Snacks> Battelle recently had one of their programmers give a TED talk. This group is just geeky enough to enjoy it. I found it interesting: http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_domas_the_1s_and_0s_behind_cyber_warfare
[11:22:19] <MikeD_> so what will you do for chemical destruction?
[11:22:59] <Jattenalle> Snacks, bah, it really annoys me when programmers pretend we actually ever bother with the "1s and 0s"
[11:23:26] <Jattenalle> it's about as valid as a painter pretending he has to re-arrange molecular structures and surface scattering behaviour on a daily basis..
[11:23:28] <Snacks> Jattenalle: Yeah, I caught that too.
[11:23:31] <Jattenalle> it's not "wrong" it's just silly
[11:23:50] <Snacks> The overall concept is solid though, for most things
[11:25:10] <saony> guys!!
[11:25:39] <MikeD_> is that the IRC version of Turettes ?
[11:25:47] <duch_kazatel> guys
[11:25:49] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell guys
[11:25:52] <Jattenalle> guys!!
[11:25:54] <saony> Are there some way of to set an array outside the post function for atach inside the function
[11:25:55] <saony> ?
[11:26:01] <tw2113> what about the girls in here
[11:26:18] <decx> goys !
[11:26:40] <duch_kazatel> saony wut
[11:27:13] <saony> http://jsfiddle.net/mpLj5/
[11:27:20] <Jattenalle> Snacks, heh, also bragging about how he can make a phone explode.. yeah ok...
[11:27:21] <saony> something like this
[11:27:38] <duch_kazatel> that's... not an array.
[11:28:01] <saony> oh yes, I'm sorry. but that's the idea
[11:28:03] <duch_kazatel> should be able to just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/mpLj5/1/
[11:28:04] <Jattenalle> "finding a needle in a stack of needles" what? who calls it that? this is dumb :P
[11:28:11] <Jattenalle> Snacks, who is this guy?
[11:28:31] <saony> kazatel : like this works perfectly?
[11:28:37] <saony> Thank you
[11:28:46] <saony> **
[11:29:04] <duch_kazatel> saony if you use my full handle my client will notify me that i was mentioned - most folks are setup that way ;)
[11:29:17] <decx> kazatel is an eastern european phone company
[11:29:36] <saony> ok
[11:29:38] <saony> thanks
[11:30:09] <Jattenalle> Snacks, the picture of a kitten.. suddenly the 1s and 0s have color.. how did this guy get TED time at all :/
[11:30:14] <duch_kazatel> decx hah - Kaza Tel
[11:30:27] <MikeD_> don't talk about that unless you'd like a call from DHS or NSA or whoever is listening...
[11:31:13] <gbfine> Best book for learning jquery is???
[11:31:19] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com
[11:32:24] <gbfine> Anyone got a example of a function that has a callback in it?
[11:32:25] <MikeD_> I'm amazed people still use the term "book"
[11:33:02] <duch_kazatel> gbfine sure $('div').on('click', function() { console.log('butts!') });
[11:33:14] <Jattenalle> dear.. "This is what english text looks like at a binary level" <- TIL "english text" is a binary standard, and always looks and behaves the same... guess ASCII == UTF32 == B64
[11:33:16] <duch_kazatel> gbfine the function(){} bit is a callback.
[11:34:02] <MikeD_> Jattenalle: *sigh*
[11:34:09] <duch_kazatel> gbfine you could also define a function beforehand and call that instead.  $('div').on('click', someFunctionYouDefined);
[11:34:22] <duch_kazatel> someFunctionYouDefined is the callack, in that case.
[11:34:25] <Jattenalle> MikeD_, what?
[11:34:52] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle the presenter is trying to bridge the gap and communicate on the audience's level.
[11:35:16] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, but what he's saying doesnt make sense
[11:35:32] <duch_kazatel> sure it does.  you're just being pedantic ;)
[11:36:02] <Jattenalle> him claiming he can detect language by looking at raw binary, is dumb, you need more info
[11:36:15] <MikeD_> Jattenalle: you know too much, so if you can teach the material you probably shouldn't be listening to the dumb-down version
[11:36:16] <Jattenalle> but he's saying "no no, we make it LESS info! and that's how it works!"
[11:36:23] <Jattenalle> MikeD_, hehe
[11:36:29] <duch_kazatel> that'd require FAR more time than his 15 minutes on stage.
[11:36:35] <duch_kazatel> he's talking to laypeople.
[11:36:47] <Jattenalle> TED has several complex talks that arent dumbing stuff down
[11:36:51] <MikeD_> laypeople have no business trying to understand binary
[11:36:57] <MikeD_> ... beyond "yes or no"
[11:36:59] <Jattenalle> this is beyond dumbed down, what he's saying is literally wrong
[11:37:22] <Jattenalle> also, i want to know how he made the phone explode
[11:37:23] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle I think you're just being overly critical.
[11:37:59] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, well, when an overpaid glorified script kiddie claims he can blow up any cellphone in the world, at will, i become critical :P
[11:38:11] <Jattenalle> "with the press of a button"
[11:38:23] <duch_kazatel> also - it's TedxColumbus, so this isn't the big main conf.
[11:38:30] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, yeah
[11:38:45] <MikeD_> well, first they have to download the "remote explode my cellphone app" and that requires considerable social engineering beyond the scope of this TED talk...
[11:38:53] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:39:28] <Jattenalle> i wonder what a visual representation of the binary of his visual representation of binary of a picture of a kitten/english/russian/x86 code looks like
[11:39:34] <Jattenalle> we must go deeper!
[11:39:36] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:40:05] <MikeD_> I'd make it a cat with one eye a 1 and the other eye a 0
[11:40:26] <duch_kazatel> gbfine did you get the info you needed?
[11:40:31] <MikeD_> also useful in a schroedinger's cat discussion
[11:40:44] <djQuery_> no no no these guys have all the gov contracts so they just use the back door
[11:41:04] <Jattenalle> djQuery_, google.com/hackgmail.js <- legit! :D
[11:41:06] <MikeD_> That reminds me of a scene in Wargames
[11:41:30] <Jattenalle> "This is unix, i know this!" -Jurrassic Park
[11:41:47] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle except that actually WAS unix ;)
[11:41:54] <decx> that visual filesystem is an actual thing
[11:41:57] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:41:58] <Jattenalle> i know, and she's actually browsing the file structure
[11:42:05] <MikeD_> "Fly this macbook to the mothership and upload a virus to the aliens"
[11:42:06] <gbfine> Yes duch thanks, I read some of the getting started on that page but did not know if there was a better source like w3school or something else. Thats the reason for the question about a book.
[11:42:07] <Jattenalle> but having your doors tied to opening a folder, is a bit odd :P
[11:42:14] <decx> hah
[11:42:26] <duch_kazatel> gbfine don't ever use W3Schools
[11:42:29] <Jattenalle> MikeD_, that's just absurd... Mac's can't have viruses!
[11:42:31] <gbfine> btw, Books can still teach you stuff. Not a lie.....
[11:42:33] <MikeD_> macbook couldn't connect to a windows server much less an alien mothership
[11:42:52] <davidpardy> i want to do a simple console.log for the tokenInput variable when ‘customPurchase’ is clicked: how would I do this? http://codeshare.io/8q0SI
[11:42:56] <duch_kazatel> gbfine sure, I have a few paper books, but for jQuery you really want learn.jquery.com.
[11:42:56] <MikeD_> you mean you can't even _write_ viruses on a mac?  lame.
[11:43:18] <gbfine> Alright, Thanks duch
[11:43:35] <duch_kazatel> davidpardy you can just use $(element).on('click', function() {/*your code here*/});
[11:43:36] <MikeD_> ... even if you license the virus-writing SDK from Apple via iTunes ?
[11:43:55] <Snacks> sorry, got busy... Jattenalle I'm not sure who he is. Just a guy that works for a company I'm going to interview for
[11:44:24] <Jattenalle> Snacks, heh, so you'll know how to hack the kitten english soon enough, using 1s and 0s, that are colored, and 3D! :D
[11:44:36] <Jattenalle> oh and blow up cellphones at will :)
[11:44:38] <Snacks> meow!
[11:45:09] <davidpardy> well right if i do console.log(tokenInput); within the customPurchase click, tokenInput will be undefined
[11:46:03] <djQuery_> console.log($('#tokenInput').val());
[11:46:10] <djQuery_> davidpardy, ^^
[11:46:22] <davidpardy> ah! let me try that
[11:48:18] <Guest43914> can you add deley to mouseleave ?
[11:48:58] <BillCriswell> Guest43914: You can use setTimeout
[11:52:26] <djQuery_> Guest22956, dont forget to cancel the setTimeout if they enter something else though
[11:52:46] <djQuery_> dont want 2 submenues open at the same time
[11:57:18] <Guest43914> it seems I should be using slidedown / slideup to make this work right.
[11:57:48] <djQuery_> Guest22956, have you looked at jquery ui position
[11:57:59] <Guest43914> no
[11:58:38] <djQuery_> it allows you to position 1 element in relation to another element and takes care of all the pesky flipping and what not when there isnt enough room for the element
[11:59:00] <Guest43914> To google I go ... AWAY !!
[12:03:55] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can recommend a simple drag and drop ajax upload multiple per page?
[12:04:40] <decx> blueimps seems popular
[12:05:19] <decx> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[12:05:28] <Guest43914> So if i want to take http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/2/ and use show() im not sure were I would place if. woudl it be line : 16 & 24
[12:06:09] <duch_kazatel> Guest43914 first, get a nick.
[12:06:19] <duch_kazatel> second, you'd use .hide() and .show() instead of editing the css.
[12:06:46] <Snacks> Guest43914: you need to hit "Update" then give us the new URL
[12:07:09] <Sir_Tommy> idk why I didnt do that sooner
[12:07:14] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[12:07:36] <Snacks> ok ... Sir_Tommy : you need to hit "Update" then give us the new URL
[12:08:13] <Sir_Tommy> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/3/
[12:08:44] <duch_kazatel> Sir_Tommy now instead of doing .css(), you'd use .show() or .hide()
[12:08:58] <Sir_Tommy> Ill edit it now.
[12:09:14] <duch_kazatel> also - matching_ul.css('min-width',elem_width); wat
[12:09:18] <duch_kazatel> :(
[12:10:54] <Sir_Tommy> I thought it would avoid mousing out of elem when moving down lol
[12:10:57] <Sir_Tommy> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/4/
[12:13:05] <Snacks> Hmmm, I changed the code to how and hide, but now it's not responding: http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/5/
[12:13:25] <djQuery_> never shows for me
[12:13:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/6/
[12:13:46] <duch_kazatel> use display: none; instead of visibility: hidden;
[12:14:21] <Snacks> much better
[12:14:28] <Sir_Tommy> ahh okay
[12:15:18] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/7/ little more formatting love.
[12:17:12] <Snacks> except, matchingul isn't defined now, so you don't need: matching_ul.css('min-width', elem_width);
[12:18:19] <Sir_Tommy> okay, it sounded like a good idea when i did it
[12:18:41] <Snacks> so, Sir_Tommy , why aren't you just using jQuery UI for this. Or some other prebuilt menu system. Instead of reinventing the wheel?
[12:19:28] <Sir_Tommy> idk, it forces me to go thru APi and learn what it does.
[12:19:51] <duch_kazatel> Sir_Tommy which is what you're doing with jQuery anyway.
[12:19:51] <djQuery_> Snacks, but we need more wheels
[12:20:03] <Snacks> but not square wheels
[12:20:18] <djQuery_> Snacks, I like triangle wheels
[12:20:22] <Sir_Tommy> 5th dementional wheels are my next project..... who's in ?
[12:20:25] <MikeD_> square wheels are idea on half-moon roads
[12:20:27] <Snacks> less sides... must work better
[12:20:52] <Snacks> hyper-cube wheels! yes!
[12:21:03] * djQuery_ read that as 5th demented
[12:21:12] <MikeD_> hypersphere wheels
[12:21:50] <Sir_Tommy> who told me to goto  http://api.jqueryui.com/ ?
[12:22:08] <duch_kazatel> djQuery_ did.
[12:22:12] <MikeD_> or if you're already bending reality to make 'em, what about a Moebius tires?
[12:22:27] <Sir_Tommy> You sir or mam are a god, I thank you again.
[12:22:28] <Snacks> I'd like to see one of these rolling down the street: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtSNStVW81M
[12:22:50] <Sir_Tommy> Challenge accepted !!
[12:24:11] <djQuery_> MikeD_, moebius tires could exist now
[12:24:55] <djQuery_> take a stip of steel twist it 1 180 degress roll it and weld the ends together
[12:24:56] <duch_kazatel> oh woah it's 12:30.
[12:24:58] <djQuery_> add spokes
[12:25:02] <MikeD_> ok, hyper moebius
[12:25:13] <Sir_Tommy> 1230 ? someone is on the west coast
[12:25:14] <MikeD_> or hyper kleinbottle wheels
[12:25:18] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:25:39] <MikeD_> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:8-cell-simple.gif  i got distracted by this cool animated gif
[12:26:15] <djQuery_> MikeD_, that would be possible to make just a pain
[12:28:14] <Sir_Tommy> so now it show()  but the hide will not work.  http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/8/      give me 5min see if i find this.
[12:29:38] <Snacks> times up: http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/9/
[12:30:07] <Sir_Tommy> I did that but it is gone to fast
[12:32:10] <Sir_Tommy> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/11/   and it never goes away.
[12:34:07] <Snacks> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/12/
[12:36:05] <Sir_Tommy> ahhh
[12:39:23] <djQuery_> Sir_Tommy, http://jsbin.com/cimiri/1/edit
[12:41:04] <djQuery_> Sir_Tommy, Snacks dont forget to call .stop() before doing your animation
[12:41:04] <djQuery_> $('ul.' + elem_class).stop().slideDown(2000);
[12:41:14] <djQuery_> otherwise you get the bouncing animation
[12:41:37] <Snacks> yep yep
[12:41:39] <djQuery_> hmm still doing it if I hove over login
[12:42:04] <djQuery_> is the submenu not a child of login havent looked at the html
[12:42:19] <Sir_Tommy> It is
[12:42:39] <djQuery_> Sir_Tommy, did you look at the one I posted?
[12:42:46] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/cimiri/1/edit
[12:42:54] <Sir_Tommy> ya, looks like I didnt add the src
[12:43:28] <Snacks> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/13/
[12:45:27] <djQuery_> Sir_Tommy, is the login screen all thats going to be there?
[12:45:40] <djQuery_> none of the other menu items going to do anything?
[12:45:48] <Sir_Tommy> it will
[12:45:58] <Sir_Tommy> same effect
[12:49:48] <davidpardy> can i put multiple values in .val()?
[12:49:55] <davidpardy> like .val(item1, item2);
[12:50:54] <duch_lunch> you can, but the second arg won't do anything.
[12:51:05] <duch_lunch> http://jsfiddle.net/X6nGN/
[12:51:13] <davidpardy> yeah thats whats occurring
[12:51:24] <davidpardy> gotcha
[12:52:01] <duch_lunch> if you want both in there, you'll have to concat the strings first: http://jsfiddle.net/X6nGN/1/
[12:52:09] <duch_lunch> or concat inside on the .val() call.
[12:53:03] <davidpardy> oh okay. that will work
[12:53:06] <davidpardy> thank you
[13:00:51] <Snacks> hmmmm... that feeling of no longer wanting to do my work because I know there's another job opportunity on the horizon..... day dreaming.....
[13:08:07] <djQuery> Snacks, potential job + security clearance
[13:08:31] <Snacks> yep. I'm ex-Army, so the clearance thing shouldn't be a problem
[13:13:15] <Forbidd3n> I have jQuery(document).ready(function($){...}); in the head and including jquery in the footer, I am getting jQuery not defined
[13:13:25] <Forbidd3n> hmm.. what would I be doing incorrectly?
[13:13:42] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, head running before footer?
[13:13:58] <Zzaichik> yeah you'd have to include jquery before using it.
[13:14:03] <djQuery> move head script after footer script?
[13:14:14] <Forbidd3n> ok thanks
[13:14:22] <duch_lunch> or include jquery before your script.  either or.
[13:16:01] <Sir_Tommy> last crack at this, the sub nav fades even if i mouse over it.   http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/17/
[13:16:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:16:43] <duch_kazatel> oh, you don't have jquery-ui in that fiddle, yo.
[13:16:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/VjNWL/18/
[13:17:05] <Sir_Tommy> http://bloodynoseproductions.yzi.me/  mouse over Login
[13:17:27] <djQuery> Sir_Tommy, A Database Error Occurred
[13:17:51] <Sir_Tommy> I havent hooked mysql to finish my login form yet
[13:18:12] <duch_kazatel> you have two versions of jquery on that page.
[13:18:13] <Sir_Tommy> did that on purpose
[13:18:17] <Blaster> Hey, I have a fixed header in Bootstrap, and when the page scroll reaches a certain point, I want to set a background on the header.   Would I just listen for the scroll event to fire, and when the scroll value reaches a certain value, set the background CSS?
[13:18:27] <duch_kazatel> you should only include one.
[13:18:28] <Sir_Tommy> really ?
[13:18:49] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/THh3YgK.png
[13:18:57] <djQuery> Sir_Tommy, also I suggest you not use the class to get the name of the items
[13:19:02] <duch_kazatel> also your html is not valid.
[13:19:06] <Sir_Tommy> line 14 and 15 right
[13:19:29] <duch_kazatel> Sir_Tommy these are on 55/58 of the rendered page.
[13:19:49] <Forbidd3n> will this fine all ul depth or just first child - $('.list-toggle').find('ul')
[13:20:00] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n both
[13:20:23] <duch_kazatel> Sir_Tommy also your html isn't valid - you can't do <li><a><form></a></li>
[13:20:43] <duch_kazatel> and you can then later do <li><a></form></a></li>
[13:20:48] <Forbidd3n> how could I get it to be the immediate child not all
[13:20:56] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n you want .children()
[13:21:32] <Forbidd3n> I don't want all depths, just the first level immediately after
[13:21:37] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, .find will get children grandchildren etc....
[13:21:39] <Forbidd3n> can you give an example, please
[13:21:43] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n correct - that is .children()
[13:21:55] <duch_kazatel> $('.list-toggle').children('ul');
[13:21:55] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, .children will only get children
[13:22:02] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/children/
[13:22:04] <Forbidd3n> $('.list-toggle').children()
[13:22:21] <duch_kazatel> you can optionally filter by a selector, as my example shows.
[13:22:23] <Blaster>     $(window).scroll(function (e) {       if(window.scrollY > 330) {   $('.navbar-default').css('background', 'blue');   }   if(window.scrollY < 330) { $('.navbar-default').css('background', 'transparent');  }  });  <-- is this going to get me in trouble for certain browsers or screen sizes?
[13:22:40] <w00tb3ast> Has anyone worked with Taboola before? If you have can you send me a PM
[13:23:07] <djQuery> Sir_Tommy, this will be less likely to break on you $(this).children('ul').stop().hide('fold', 3000);
[13:23:18] <Sir_Tommy> duch_kazatel: I dont see were I did <form> as li a
[13:23:20] <duch_kazatel> Blaster not necessarily.
[13:23:25] <djQuery> Sir_Tommy, and allow you to add more classes if needed
[13:23:39] <duch_kazatel> Sir_Tommy i'm looking at the rendered page source.
[13:23:57] <Sir_Tommy> ahh okay 33
[13:24:09] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/czaZdNw.png
[13:24:10] <Sir_Tommy> not sure why I would li a that at all
[13:24:24] <duch_kazatel> you also have two opening form tags.
[13:24:35] <duch_kazatel> also: <br/> is not a valid child of a <ul>
[13:24:54] <duch_kazatel> make your html valid first, then we can tackle the rest.
[13:25:00] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're wrestling with invalid html./
[13:25:41] <Sir_Tommy> if i do just html/php im fine. I just have been messing with <script> this is my first time today
[13:25:52] <Sir_Tommy> and have messed a lot of formatting up
[13:26:03] <duch_kazatel> the invalid html has nothing to do with js ;)
[13:26:50] <Sir_Tommy> at first I was doing  js in the body lol
[13:27:02] <Sir_Tommy> then google was invented
[13:27:17] <Sir_Tommy> and things became much clearer
[13:28:33] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: I have a nested list and I want to slideDown children if parent is clicked and close others. Just like accordian would do, but without the jquery accordian concept
[13:28:40] <Forbidd3n> or structure shall I say
[13:29:17] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n far out.
[13:29:31] <duch_kazatel> lol do you need help figuring out how to do that?
[13:29:35] <duch_kazatel> do you have a fiddle of your html?
[13:36:00] <djQuery> whats the doesn't have class selector?
[13:36:49] <djQuery> $('tbody').on('td -.noclick', 'click', function(){});
[13:37:33] <djQuery> $('tbody').on('td:not(.noclick)', 'click', function(){});
[13:37:38] <djQuery> thanks guys
[13:39:25] <ggt> Hi. Anyone know why this jquery selector doesn't work? $("body:first-child") ?
[13:39:45] <djQuery> ggt, howbout this one
[13:39:48] <BillCriswell> Holy shit glad that's over.
[13:40:10] <djQuery> $('body').children().first()
[13:40:26] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/jpvPn/
[13:40:32] <djQuery> also are you sure there is no text even commented text as the first thing in the body
[13:40:38] <Forbidd3n> see what it does when you click the folder 2 and the folder under it
[13:40:39] <BillCriswell> ggt: That should give you the body element, which I hope you only have one of.
[13:40:44] <Forbidd3n> thanks for the help btw
[13:40:58] <jParkton> bill do you know firebase api?
[13:41:04] <BillCriswell> jParkton: I do not.
[13:41:09] <BillCriswell> I don't know any fun stuff. =(
[13:41:10] <jParkton> le sad
[13:41:21] <jParkton> learn it and teach me
[13:41:22] <jParkton> lol
[13:41:48] <BillCriswell> I tried it for 10 minutes like most things I come across then get bored and wonder off somewhere.
[13:42:01] <BillCriswell> I don't remember a damn thing about it, though.
[13:42:09] <jParkton> i just wanna login
[13:42:20] <jParkton> its a terrible thing to be a nub
[13:43:26] <EminenceHC> Is hiding a button after it is clicked a good way to prevent double clicks from screwing stuff up?
[13:43:34] <ggt> djQuery:thanks. But weird. Why does ("body > :first-child") work? hm
[13:43:40] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, so the issue is that you cant expand 2.1 right
[13:44:02] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: the issue is when you do it opens and closes parent and child multiple times
[13:44:08] <BillCriswell> ggt: body:first-child gets the first <body> element, not the first child of <body>.
[13:44:17] <Forbidd3n> and it won't stay open
[13:44:27] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: It could be confusing. You can use the disabled attribute.
[13:44:45] <EminenceHC> BillCriswell: Ah ok I didn't know i could disable a button.
[13:44:56] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, course not you have this as the first thing; $('.list-toggle').find('ul').slideUp();
[13:45:20] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, some how you need to exclude the parent container
[13:45:20] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: I know my syntax is incorrect thta is what I need help with
[13:45:34] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: Yurp.
[13:45:41] <Forbidd3n> I think filter would work, but nto sure how to incorporate it
[13:45:42] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n your issue is you're basing all your logic off classes - use $(this) to get the current clicked element and base all your logic with that.
[13:46:07] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, $(this).siblings().slideUp()
[13:46:22] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: anyway you could edit the fiddle to help me with what your saying
[13:46:37] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: I want to slide up all menus that are open
[13:46:42] <Forbidd3n> not just siblings
[13:46:48] <Forbidd3n> siblings could have children open as well
[13:47:04] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n i don't do that.  i'll help you figure it out though :)
[13:47:05] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, no you dont if you slide them all up you will be sliding the parent up
[13:47:19] <thinkxl> data-opened="true" and get those
[13:47:26] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: no problem, where would I start
[13:47:28] <antlong> can you use $(document).bind('pageinit'.. on an element that doesn't exist yet?
[13:47:45] <duch_kazatel> antlong use .on(), and the target must exist.
[13:47:52] <thinkxl> antlong if you use .on()
[13:47:54] <thinkxl> yes
[13:48:00] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n I'd start with line 4 - $('.list-toggle').find('ul').slideUp();
[13:48:15] <duch_kazatel> you instead want the child ul of all siblings of $(this)
[13:48:32] <antlong> so change what i have to $("x").on("change"   ?
[13:48:44] <duch_kazatel> antlong not just that.
[13:48:57] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('change', 'target', function() {});
[13:48:58] <Sir_Tommy> thankyou for all the help today. GL all see you soon
[13:49:09] <Snacks> l8r Sir_Tommy
[13:49:32] <duch_kazatel> antlong where 'parent' is an element that exists on pageload and 'target' is the element you were originally targeting
[13:49:50] <Forbidd3n> this works - $(this).siblings().find('ul').slideUp();
[13:49:54] <Forbidd3n> thanks djQuery
[13:49:58] <antlong> parent should be document?
[13:50:12] <duch_kazatel> antlong rarely, if ever.  try to bind as far down as you can.
[13:50:18] <duch_kazatel> if document is the only thing exists, that's fine
[13:50:19] <antlong> oh ok
[13:50:53] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n the other way to do it is toggle classes on things instead and do everything with css animations.  then you can select stuff with classes, instead of doing funky DOM traversal.
[13:51:59] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, glad it worked for you
[13:52:46] <jParkton> also why does this do nothing https://github.com/jparkton/firebaseLogin
[13:52:56] <jParkton> no error, no login
[13:52:57] <jParkton> lol
[13:54:41] <Zzaichik> dude, make a working example.
[13:55:14] <jParkton> I can make it work on jsfiddle
[13:55:22] <jParkton> so it is something with that setup
[13:55:26] <Zzaichik> word
[13:55:29] <Zzaichik> go for it.
[13:55:40] <antlong> duch_kazatel the element i used in the initial part, $('#x').on  is flickering like mad
[13:55:57] <duch_kazatel> antlong can you show me what you're doing?
[13:56:21] <Zzaichik> infinite loop style
[13:56:22] <antlong> sure, one moment
[13:56:28] <duch_kazatel> because this may be that the event you're using, and/or the callback itself, aren't working together nicely.
[13:57:41] <antlong> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/xCD2m/
[13:58:13] <duch_kazatel> ... what line?
[13:58:25] <antlong> the last 3 lines
[13:58:26] <duch_kazatel> $('#itemInfo').on('change', 'input', function (e) { btw
[13:58:32] <duch_kazatel> not the jquery selector.
[13:58:34] <antlong> oh
[13:58:53] <antlong> maybe thats why
[13:59:09] <djQuery> if (~e.target.id.indexOf('player') && parseInt(item.planetLimit, 10) >
[13:59:21] <thinkxl> what ~ means?
[13:59:21] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf.
[13:59:22] <djQuery> antlong, ~e   realy
[13:59:37] <djQuery> didnt think that was valid
[13:59:38] <duch_kazatel> antlong you're doing a lot of really awkward stuff in here.
[13:59:55] <UserError> Maybe we should switch usernames antlong
[14:00:10] <thinkxl> duch_kazatel he is using stuff like the 140byt.es guys
[14:00:22] <antlong> duch_kazatel i don't know javascript very well
[14:00:32] <djQuery> antlong, your doing all this storage client side?
[14:00:37] <jParkton> maybe abandon the firebase login and use php instead
[14:00:39] <jParkton> :(
[14:00:41] <antlong> in localStorage
[14:00:46] <djQuery> antlong, will add everything to my storage myselft then
[14:00:57] <duch_kazatel> antlong you all ready used event delegation in this file before - $(document).on('mousedown', '.hasMenu', function (e) {
[14:01:25] <duch_kazatel> also ~item.category.indexOf('building') is flawed.
[14:01:53] <antlong> how so?
[14:02:19] <duch_kazatel> because that can return 0 - which means is exists in the string.
[14:02:30] <duch_kazatel> so wrapping that in an if check is shaky.
[14:02:35] <antlong> they are all assigned values, -1 means it doesn't exist
[14:02:41] <antlong> like there's no item in that slot
[14:02:42] <duch_kazatel> right - 0 means it does.
[14:02:52] <antlong> oh i see
[14:02:57] <duch_kazatel> if any of those return 0, they'll evaluate to false.
[14:03:05] <duch_kazatel> you want to test if they're > -1 instead.
[14:03:34] <antlong> for all of them?
[14:03:51] <duch_kazatel> probably, though you're repeating a lot of logic in here.
[14:04:50] <antlong> wait i'm confused
[14:05:08] <antlong> 'building' always exists, and its 0 or a number larger than 0
[14:05:13] <antlong> same with 'planet'
[14:05:16] <duch_kazatel> let me show it.
[14:05:18] <duch_kazatel> *show you
[14:06:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/CcrK6/
[14:06:12] <djQuery> antlong, jslint is throwing several errors with you use of ~
[14:06:47] <djQuery> Too many errors. (47% scanned).
[14:06:53] <duch_kazatel> in that fiddle, the word 'this' exists, but indexOf() is returning 0.  0 == false.
[14:07:16] <duch_kazatel> because the index of that substring is at index 0 of the string itself.
[14:07:29] <duch_kazatel> instead what you want is this: http://jsfiddle.net/CcrK6/1/
[14:07:45] <antlong> ohhh ok
[14:08:07] <duch_kazatel> you should really read some basics.
[14:08:20] <antlong> in my defense, it does work
[14:08:21] <antlong> but i will
[14:08:39] <antlong> question: since i'm using 'input'  how do i specify the first occurrence?
[14:08:46] <duch_kazatel> give it a class.
[14:08:49] <antlong> $(document).on('change', 'input', function(e) {
[14:08:50] <decx> ~str.indexOf() behaves the same duch_kazatel
[14:08:54] <antlong> oh ok
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> decx :(
[14:09:15] <duch_kazatel> why do people do that?
[14:09:57] <decx> mystery is the best way to hide that you are boring
[14:10:09] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1789952/923919 - the comment with 195 upvotes.
[14:10:12] <duch_kazatel> *1095
[14:11:28] <decx> it's quaint, but production code should be clear of course
[14:11:58] <duch_kazatel> i had to bring that point up when a few of our devs were trying to throw code like that into our codebase.
[14:13:00] <duch_kazatel> "But this jsperf shows it's a billion times faster!!!" "right, and it's unreadable and munges code"
[14:13:49] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, and unreaedable and doesn't meet our code formating standards
[14:13:56] <djQuery> and cant be unit tested
[14:14:02] <djQuery> etc etc...
[14:14:19] <duch_kazatel> djQuery we aren't doing unit tests for our frontend code quite yet.
[14:14:25] <duch_kazatel> we're working towards it.
[14:15:04] <duch_kazatel> we open up code formatting discussions, but my #1 rule with JS is always to be Clear and Explicit.
[14:16:01] <decx> like http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3RgED/ ...that confused me for a while
[14:16:07] <UserError> Explicit is better than... oh wait wrong channel.
[14:16:26] <systemfault> Reallt difficult and expensive to test DOM interactions… :/
[14:16:55] <duch_kazatel> decx D: nooooo
[14:18:46] <duch_kazatel> i am stoked: i have the hook up at Sierra Nevada.  I get to go pick up a cylinder and a jocky box from them soon.
[14:19:03] <djQuery> decx, gues this is the closest to doing something like that I have in my code. msweep[x] = (msweep[x] || {});
[14:19:25] <djQuery> if the object doesnt exist create it
[14:19:33] <duch_kazatel> djQuery that's actually pretty commong.
[14:19:35] <decx> yeah that i use all the time too
[14:19:57] <duch_kazatel> which isn't nearly as bad as the way coldfusion makes you deal with that.
[14:20:54] <djQuery> decx, duch_kazatel some of the jquery ui code gets caried away with that but its still at an understandable level
[14:21:12] <djQuery> 3 or 4 if statements in 1 line like that
[14:21:15] <duch_kazatel> it has to - Users are Stupid™
[14:21:38] <djQuery> think button does it the most
[14:21:39] <PantsOfChoco> thats me!
[14:23:25] <djQuery> of I have a regular array of html objects can I just $(tiles).each(
[14:23:39] <djQuery> or do I need to do a regular loop 1st
[14:23:47] <duch_kazatel> you can just $(tiles) iirc
[14:24:14] <duch_kazatel> yep http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/

[14:25:45] <dan_j> Hi, whats the easiest way to disable an entire class if the object doesnt have an ID?
[14:25:49] <jParkton> I dont get any error when I click my button
[14:26:04] <jParkton> can you see anything obvious
[14:26:05] <duch_kazatel> dan_j define "disable"
[14:26:15] <duch_kazatel> jParkton i'm no really able to dump through that atm, >.>
[14:26:21] <jParkton> k
[14:27:07] <djQuery> jParkton, am I supposed to read the whole thing or is there "When I do this I get that"
[14:27:25] <djQuery> jParkton, cause I am not reading the whole thing
[14:27:33] <duch_kazatel> is there a firebase channel?
[14:27:36] <dan_j> duch_kazatel: remove it totally from an object so the contents of the class dont affect the object any more.
[14:27:46] <jParkton> there is but it is dead
[14:28:29] <dan_j> .removeClass but I cant see a way of accessing the object without an id.
[14:28:45] <duch_kazatel> dan_j not following - could you please create a fiddle?
[14:29:31] <dan_j> its difficult. the html/css etc have been altered and generated by javascript.
[14:29:51] <djQuery> dan_j, you are going to have to use $('.someClass').filter(function(){   return !($(this).hasAttribute('id));});
[14:30:08] <djQuery> but forget what .hasAttribute is
[14:30:36] <duch_kazatel> dan_j a small use-case is fine.
[14:31:32] <djQuery> dan_j, return !($(this).hasAttr('id'));
[14:32:36] <duch_kazatel> there is no .hasAttr() is there?
[14:33:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Nwv3j/
[14:33:37] <duch_kazatel> dan_j is this what you're looking for?
[14:33:59] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, yeah there is none so you would have to add it real q
[14:34:03] <antlong> if i type in this input, then delete it, it's showing the value as 1
[14:34:09] <djQuery> dan_j, sorry bout that
[14:34:20] <duch_kazatel> djQuery or you just test the value of .prop('id')
[14:35:13] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/Vitzkrieg/u2Hbu/
[14:35:13] <decx> hasAttr('id') ?
[14:35:26] <decx> why not just this.id
[14:35:30] <dan_j> Ok, maybe a simpler question, given the name of a class, how can I remove a property such as max-width?
[14:35:31] <duch_kazatel> or this.id
[14:35:50] <duch_kazatel> dan_j you mean a css property?
[14:35:52] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, thought that id would be one of those attr items unlike disabled
[14:35:53] <dan_j> yes
[14:36:32] <duch_kazatel> dan_j you can set it to a different value, but you can't "remove" it afaik. decx might have a way.
[14:36:38] <duch_kazatel> you can remove the class just fine.
[14:36:44] <dan_j> Would this work?
[14:36:45] <dan_j> $('.rxp-placeholder').css('max-width',null);
[14:36:52] <duch_kazatel> dan_j you mentioned not being able to select them later, right?
[14:37:10] <dan_j> Yes, the object that that class is affecting does not have an id
[14:37:11] <duch_kazatel> is that what you're trying to get around?
[14:37:18] <decx> what remove?
[14:37:21] <decx> remove id?
[14:37:32] <antlong> i should use .bind if i want to put multiple handlers on an object, right?
[14:37:36] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - if you cache beforehand the var still references everything just find.
[14:37:44] <duch_kazatel> antlong no, use .on() for all event binding.
[14:37:50] <duch_kazatel> no bind, live, delegate, etc.
[14:37:51] <duch_kazatel> just .on()
[14:37:58] <dan_j> there are 4 properies in that class. Ideally, i want to remove/disable all 4
[14:38:06] <duch_kazatel> dan_j right, so remove the class.
[14:38:12] <antlong> so i need a new code block for each on() then? or can i put multiple handlers in one block?
[14:38:30] <duch_kazatel> you can use a function as a proxy and call of them them that way.
[14:38:32] <dan_j> how do I remove the class when the object doesnt have an id to select it?
[14:38:39] <duch_kazatel> dan_j you don't need the id.  let me show youy.
[14:38:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Nwv3j/1/
[14:39:02] <duch_kazatel> cache the selector and you're fine.
[14:40:22] <duch_kazatel> so stoked to pick up this cylinder today!
[14:40:28] <decx> is that a beer thing?
[14:40:38] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[14:40:59] <decx> so what do you put in it
[14:41:00] <duch_kazatel> have a hook up at sierra nevada.  they're getting me a cylinder and a jocky box for a party on saturday.

[14:42:54] <djQuery> antlong, forget if you need 'mouseup mousedown' of 'mouseup, mousedown'
[14:42:59] <decx> This beer is retired; no longer brewed.
[14:43:08] <decx> well not at your house it seems, nice
[14:43:18] <duch_kazatel> nah, not homebrew.
[14:43:23] <duch_kazatel> from a local brewery.
[14:43:27] <antlong> djQuery nice, i'm only using focusout, blur and mouseleave.
[14:43:37] <duch_kazatel> djQuery it's space separated.
[14:43:46] <dan_j> trying to build it on jsfiddle
[14:43:56] <decx> oh you mean for a ... what do you call it tap?
[14:43:57] <ZacHarney> Is there a way to make line 3 in the javascript of this JSFiddle work? http://jsfiddle.net/zacharney/3AE6n/
[14:43:57] <duch_kazatel> dan_j did you look at my last fiddle?
[14:44:11] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah - jocky box in our case.
[14:44:13] <decx> a zapfhahn
[14:44:30] <duch_kazatel> you crazy germans
[14:44:37] <djQuery> antlong, oh and you can chain them $('what4ever').on().on().on()
[14:44:55] <duch_kazatel> ZacHarney the removeClass?
[14:45:03] <ZacHarney> yes
[14:45:18] <ZacHarney> it's overriden by the later scroll funtion
[14:45:21] <ZacHarney> *function
[14:45:37] <duch_kazatel> you need to wait until that scroll is done first.
[14:45:54] <duch_kazatel> fwiw, it works for me just fine.
[14:46:11] <fluxx0r> yeah works for me too
[14:47:09] <ZacHarney> Is there anyway to amend the if statement so that if the back to top button is clicked, it removes the class straight away instead of waiting until it gets to the top?
[14:47:46] <duch_kazatel> are you just trying to hide that header thing on click?
[14:48:13] <fluxx0r> you want the "Back To Top" to go away before the scroll?
[14:48:37] <duch_kazatel> set a boolean var that's something like "hiddenFromClick" then check that var in your if check.
[14:49:04] <duch_kazatel> and then set it to false when the scroll to top animation is done.
[14:49:09] <ZacHarney> how do I do that?
[14:49:21] <duch_kazatel> which part?
[14:49:33] <ZacHarney> Still only know some basic js and jquery. The bool var
[14:49:42] <duch_kazatel> var isClicked = false;
[14:50:35] <w1ll> For some reason I can't get the on change event from a dynamically create select. http://pastebin.com/ZUurSuAR
[14:50:42] <w1ll> The alert never fires
[14:50:55] <duch_kazatel> w1ll use event delegation instead.
[14:51:12] <w1ll> sweet ty
[14:51:26] <duch_kazatel> $('#new_goal').on('change', '#sub_goal_one_select', function(){});
[14:51:53] <dan_j> duch_kazatel: heres the real example. http://jsfiddle.net/RjFmg/ When its in production, rxp-placeholder shifts the page incorrectly. like this http://imgbin.org/index.php?page=image&id=18315
[14:51:55] <duch_kazatel> assuming new_goal is a parent of that sub_goal_one_select
[14:52:13] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:52:17] <duch_kazatel> dan_j did you see my fiddle from earlier?
[14:52:30] <duch_kazatel> because you just effectively used jsfiddle wrong heh
[14:52:36] <dan_j> duch_kazatel: yes, but it didnt seem to work.
[14:52:48] <duch_kazatel> dan_j huh?  it worked fine.
[14:53:18] <dan_j> When i used it with the actual html, it didnt have an effect. I'll try it again.
[14:53:37] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to modify it a bit for your case, but the concept is sound.
[14:53:42] <ms7> Hello, is there a way to recursively select li elements within a ul when using a for loop? I would like to append the value of i in a for loop in i number of li elements.
[14:53:58] <duch_kazatel> ms7 why?
[14:54:10] <duch_kazatel> ms7 like, what's the use case?
[14:54:56] <ms7> Say I have 10 list items in a ul. I want to insert "1" on li number 1, 2 on li number 2, etc.
[14:55:22] <duch_kazatel> in front of the different lis?
[14:55:43] <dan_j> duch_kazatel: perfect. thanks for that. i had a typo!
[14:55:51] <ms7> Inside, they're empty. They need to be populated with the number of the respective li elements.
[14:56:04] <decx> ms7 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/BXqDL/
[14:56:22] <duch_kazatel> just use CSS: http://jsfiddle.net/tu2h5/
[14:56:37] <decx> ha, true
[14:56:40] <duch_kazatel> or this: http://jsfiddle.net/tu2h5/1/
[14:57:42] <ms7> Can't be with css, thanks decx, that might be what I need.
[14:58:05] <duch_kazatel> what why?
[14:58:07] <duch_kazatel> :(
[14:59:40] <djQuery> sigh http://jsbin.com/venom/1/edit
[15:00:53] <djQuery> think I am having index issues
[15:03:15] <ZacHarney> duch_kazatel I'm trying to make the var, but how can I make the click function change the variable?
[15:04:44] <duch_kazatel> by adding a callback as a third param to .animate() ;)
[15:04:49] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/3AE6n/1/
[15:05:03] <duch_kazatel> also, why do you have return false; in there?
[15:06:11] <antlong> I have tooltips on hover, and when i right click it goes away and then comes back, and it kind of disrupts the menu. how would i fix that?
[15:06:26] <duch_kazatel> dunno without seeing your code.
[15:06:37] <djQuery> antlong, disable rightclick
[15:06:45] <duch_kazatel> probably have some kind of mouseout logic.
[15:06:47] <antlong> no i need right click, its the context menu :)
[15:06:59] <ZacHarney> from my understanding, it stops the <a href="#">Back to Top</a> from actually going to the href, so it only runs the jquery
[15:07:04] <antlong> yeah, i think maybe i can use tooltipster("disable"), its supposed to be temporary
[15:07:11] <ZacHarney> still learning though, so may be wrong
[15:07:54] <duch_kazatel> ZacHarney wrong way to do that :)  http://jsfiddle.net/3AE6n/2/
[15:07:56] <duch_kazatel> do this instead.
[15:08:12] <duch_kazatel> pass the event object to your handler and run preventDefault() against that instead.
[15:10:44] <ms7> duch_kazatel: Because it's for an exercise that requires JS/jQuery
[15:10:59] <duch_kazatel> ms7 that woulda been a good thing to note earlier :)
[15:11:01] <ZacHarney> what is the purpose of function(e) instead of function()?
[15:11:17] <ms7> I would've gone to the css channel had that not been the case ;)
[15:11:18] <duch_kazatel> ZacHarney the e names the event object so you can do stuff within it inside the function.
[15:11:43] <duch_kazatel> ms7 we get lots of folks asking general questions in here because they're not sure where to start.
[15:12:09] <ms7> Gotcha, I'll keep it in mind next time I have a question.
[15:12:59] <ZacHarney> how do I make the if statement conditional on the isClicked var being true as well as the scrollTop >= 70
[15:13:20] <duch_kazatel> ZacHarney what do you think?
[15:13:46] <djQuery> ms7, $('ul').each('li', function(key, object){});
[15:14:12] <djQuery> ms7, $('ul').each('li', function(key, object){ $(object).text(key+1); });
[15:14:13] <ZacHarney> From googling around, I've tried if ((y >= 70) && (isClicked = true)) but it still isn't working
[15:14:41] <duch_kazatel> ZacHarney that would work - thing about why your logic is flawed.  you want the header to hide?
[15:14:50] <ZacHarney> yes
[15:15:30] <duch_kazatel> think about it :)
[15:16:54] <ZacHarney> not sure - still very new to javascript and jquery, don't really understand it's logic or language much. Only know what I've used.
[15:17:05] <duch_kazatel> this is how you learn :)
[15:17:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/3AE6n/3/
[15:18:00] <duch_kazatel> i'll give you that one for free.
[15:20:07] <ZacHarney> thank you! So does !isClicked mean var is false, and having the var written as false makes it boolean?
[15:24:15] <duch_kazatel> ! is negate, so if !false === true, and !true === false.
[15:24:33] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I go for a bit.
[15:26:59] <ablegreen> How do I get Jquery to handle requests coming to that page?
[15:27:14] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/3AE6n/4/
[15:29:08] <kurion> Are the parameters in [] optional? : .animate( properties [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] )
[15:29:43] <djQuery> kurion, yes
[15:30:10] <kurion> Thanks djQuery, and parameters not in [] are not optional, I'm guessing?
[15:30:29] <djQuery> kurion, yes
[15:30:37] <kurion> Great, thank you :)
[15:30:45] <djQuery> kurion, .hide()
[15:31:02] <djQuery> nothing needed but has almost as many optional parameters
[15:31:41] <kurion> Interesting example, .hide(options) is optional
[15:31:48] <kurion> But for that one it's not in square brackets
[15:32:03] <kurion> Oh, I see why
[15:36:50] <djQuery> ablegreen, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[15:36:50] <ablegreen> djQuery: That's for sending requests
[15:36:51] <ablegreen> djQuery: not responses
[15:37:00] <djQuery> ablegreen, well nothing can request the page in my browser
[15:37:28] <ablegreen> djQuery: Sorry, what?
[15:37:36] <djQuery> ablegreen, exactly
[15:43:04] <rOOb> Hello all. I'm using blueimps jquery file uploader and I'm having a some issues. I want individual progress bars for each file being upload. I'm dynamically adding the files but I cannot target the div id later on. If I hardcore a id in I can target the id...but that doesnt work for me. This is the code that generates the dynamic id and attempts to target it http://pastebin.com/e7nfLZtk
[15:43:11] <djQuery> after I drink coffee I like to show the empty mug to the IT guy to tell him that I've successfully installed Java
[15:43:34] <rOOb> Notice the fileuploadadd and fileuploadprogress functions
[15:46:39] <LuxuryMode> I have a function like this: function escapeHTML(text) { return $('<div/>').text(text).html()} and I thought that would turn &amp; int &, but it's not. What am I missing here?
[15:49:54] <Forbidd3n> how would I get all elements that have an attribute data-open?
[15:50:06] <systemfault> Forbidd3n: [data-open]
[15:50:25] <tw2113> $.data('open'); if i recall my syntax right
[15:51:25] <systemfault> LuxuryMode: Your code works here
[15:53:00] <LuxuryMode> hmm
[15:53:04] <LuxuryMode> must be some other issue
[15:53:28] <LuxuryMode> i have this (overly) complicated function that takes a tweet and linkifies all the hashtags and urls in it
[15:53:41] <LuxuryMode> and for some reason that churns out &amp and stuff unescaped
[15:59:19] <kurion> I'm testing the animate method, here : http://jsfiddle.net/zera/fcsb5/
[15:59:32] <kurion> I'm unsure why the divs aren't turning from blue to yellow when clicked
[16:04:44] <kurion> Doh, that was a bad link, sorry: here's the updated one http://jsfiddle.net/zera/fcsb5/1/
[16:07:34] <djQuery> kurion, animate cant animate colors
[16:08:02] <kurion> OH
[16:08:22] <kurion> I looked at a stackoverFlow solution, and didn't see the comment saying that you need a plugin for it to work.
[16:08:35] <kurion> Thanks djQuery
[16:08:42] <djQuery> kurion, but jquery ui will add that functionality
[16:08:56] <djQuery> kurion, it ads some stuff to .animate
[16:09:20] <kurion> That's exactly what I need, trying to make a 16x16 grid that animates as you hover along
[16:10:59] <djQuery> kurion, http://api.jqueryui.com/color-animation/
[16:11:28] <kurion> Is jQuery UI a kind of addition to jQuery?
[16:11:42] <Darkingz> yes
[16:12:39] <kurion> Also, is there a preferable version of jQuery to use, for a kind of general purpose?
[16:13:07] <Darkingz> well if you're worried about backwords compatibility use the jquery 1.x.x branch
[16:13:55] <Darkingz> if you want to only support modern browsrs (IE 8+ for example) then use the 2.x.x branch they mention this on the site itself
[16:14:26] <kurion> Ahh okay, thanks Darkingz
[16:14:59] <djQuery> kurion, Darkingz IE6 ROCKS
[16:15:13] <Darkingz> heh no
[16:15:25] <systemfault> IE5 for mac FOREVER
[16:15:39] <duch_kazatel> hella
[16:15:44] <Darkingz> at some point you code enough hacks for old browsers that yo uhate them
[16:16:52] <duch_kazatel> or you just use jQuery and quit worrying about it.
[16:18:14] <kurion> Sorry to be a bother, but I think I have everything setup correctly here: http://jsfiddle.net/zera/fcsb5/3/
[16:18:20] <kurion> but the code still wont animate when clicked :/
[16:18:20] <Darkingz> if jquery was the only thing to worry about
[16:19:26] <djQuery> kurion,  $('td').append('<div id="test"></div>');????
[16:19:40] <djQuery> only one id="test" allowed on the page
[16:19:45] <kurion> Ohh
[16:19:58] <duch_kazatel> kurion only one test, use event delegation, and how do you expect the background color to animate?
[16:20:50] <kurion> I removed the test ID, regarding animation, I expect to click one div and then have that div animate to yellow
[16:21:01] <duch_kazatel> right - how do you animate a color value?
[16:21:19] <kurion> Changing the css background property I think
[16:21:21] <djQuery> kurion, well the click is firing http://jsfiddle.net/fcsb5/4/
[16:21:28] <duch_kazatel> kurion right - how does that animate.
[16:21:31] <duch_kazatel> how do you expect "blue" to animate to "yellow"? (protip - you can't without an extra plugin)
[16:21:57] <djQuery> kurion, working here http://jsfiddle.net/fcsb5/5/
[16:22:05] <djQuery> "background-color":"yellow".
[16:22:11] <kurion> Ohhhh
[16:22:13] <duch_kazatel> weird
[16:22:26] <duch_kazatel> does JQUI include that now?
[16:23:00] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, what the animate color? it has for a few years
[16:23:06] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[16:23:48] <djQuery> kurion, for some reason it won't do background but it will do "background-color":"yellow"
[16:24:06] <kurion> I would've never got that on my own
[16:24:33] <djQuery> kurion, read the docs lists which ones it can animate http://api.jqueryui.com/color-animation/
[16:24:59] <kurion> ahhh, that's right, the Jquery UI is what we're using.
[16:25:26] <kurion> On the website it states backgroundColor would that work as well?
[16:25:35] <djQuery> (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used).
[16:25:45] <kurion> I checked, it does
[16:25:50] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:26:34] <kurion>  (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used).
[16:26:41] <djQuery> plain $.animate lists that it can't do color on this page http://api.jquery.com/animate/   has a link to the other
[16:26:47] <kurion> Yeah, guess have to read the documents closely sometiems
[16:27:47] <kurion> Thanks all, I'll post the link to the finished project when I'm done
[16:31:06] <djQuery> am I the only one that thinks it funny when guys try to make a rhino horn with their hair?

[16:31:42] <djQuery> gues
[16:32:52] <djQuery> kinda like the faux mohawk but sillier cause it just points to the front
[16:33:00] <duch_kazatel> yeah.

[16:39:13] <mdev> when I put the datetime into mysql via jquery it looks like 2014-07-10 21:47:57 but when I pull it out it looks like {"Created":"2014-07-11T01:47:57.000Z"
[16:39:17] <mdev> how do I fix that
[16:39:24] <mdev> to make it like it was when I pull it out of the db
[16:41:58] <mdev> I used JSON.stringify( on it
[16:42:08] <mdev> after I pulled from the db
[16:42:16] <duch_kazatel> mdev your question is very strange.
[16:42:47] <duch_kazatel> you aren't putting anything into MySQL via jquery and you aren't pulling it with jquery.  are you sure your server-side is doing what you expect?
[16:43:56] <mdev> i'm using node.js and interacting with mysql via an addon
[16:44:00] <mdev> it inserts the data fine
[16:44:10] <mdev> and returns it fine as well, just the datetime is messed up
[16:44:30] <djQuery> mdev, no you are haveing some timezone issues most likely
[16:44:32] <duch_kazatel> the datetime is formatted however the db is storing it.  you can format it.
[16:44:44] <duch_kazatel> oh your issue is timezones.
[16:44:45] <djQuery> either way you need to ask in their forums
[16:45:28] <mdev> should be utc for both but i'll check thanks
[16:46:32] <djQuery> mdev, duch_kazatel used to love answering this question when working on a call tracking system with peeps located international
[16:46:59] <djQuery> why does sandeep in india see a different Open Date & Time than I do in CA
[16:47:40] <duch_kazatel> i worked at a place that worked with newspapers - we had to get data entry done in time for the papers delivery time.

[19:09:37] <PantsOfChoco> What is the best way to prevent a field from being hidden or shown by jquery? I have a field that is hidden or shown when an autocomplete is filled out and I want to completely override it is there a way to do that?
[19:10:30] <vinex08> systemfault: i really dont know how to change the - sign in +
[19:10:34] <systemfault> PantsOfChoco: Just remove the code that hides/show it?
[19:10:42] <djQuery> vinex08, take it you dont want it to colopse when you click on a child
[19:10:59] <systemfault> vinex08: Ah
[19:12:27] <PantsOfChoco> its necessary for other fields though is the problem
[19:15:15] <systemfault> vinex08: Something like that http://jsfiddle.net/2buTr/2/ ?
[19:16:26] <vinex08> oohh ican toggle between classes too
[19:16:30] <systemfault> PantsOfChoco: Perhaps you could add .css('display', 'block !important') on the elements
[19:17:38] <djQuery> PantsOfChoco, might want to look at e.stopPropogation(); for when they click on those child elements as well
[19:18:16] <vinex08> thanks man
[19:20:34] <PantsOfChoco> thanks didnt help but i do appreciate the effort
[19:20:36] <PantsOfChoco> is there a way to set the css to display none important
[19:20:41] <PantsOfChoco> or is that dumb
[19:22:37] <PantsOfChoco> oh god but thank you system you are a genius you did give me the right idea
[19:25:40] <PantsOfChoco> and i love you
[19:28:50] <sarkis> hey guys so im using bootstrap and theres a dropdown form that gets injected via an ajax GET,
[19:29:44] <sarkis> how do i ten make the submit for that form do something? i am trying to preventDefault() on it and just alert for now, to see if i have it right.. it tried in a .on('submit', '#form-id', function(e) { }
[19:30:20] <djQuery> sarkis, so the page is being after your script runs right
[19:30:28] <djQuery> sarkis, so something like this
[19:31:33] <djQuery> $('body').on('submit', 'formselector', function(e){ console.log('hey got the form); e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropogation();})
[19:32:43] <sarkis> heres what i did: https://gist.github.com/sarkis/7e9f0793481d83f89975
[19:33:11] <sarkis> so after on('click', '.vote') block
[19:36:00] <systemfault> sarkis: When dealing with forms, you want to use the submit event of the form element. Never the click event on the button
[19:39:41] <sarkis> ah yes i am dong this, sorry for the confusion: https://gist.github.com/sarkis/7e9f0793481d83f89975
[19:39:54] <sarkis> i updated with what i am trying.. for some reason that doesn't work :/
[19:40:01] <sarkis> i.e. no log output
[19:45:41] <sarkis> hmm, i guess that's not the right place to be doing this?
[20:04:11] <vinex08> systemfault: how can i prevent the url from adding the # sign when the - and + sign is clicked?
[20:04:57] <systemfault> vinex08: add event.preventDefault() in the click handler
[20:04:59] <djQuery> vinex08, does it have a name?
[20:05:12] <djQuery> then that is a function of the browser
[20:06:12] <djQuery> vinex08, you might try looking into 'click', function(e){e.preventDefault(); whatever other code });
[20:16:10] <vinex08> Spot on! thanks!
[21:44:25] <antlong> does highcharts  allow dynamic x axis values?
