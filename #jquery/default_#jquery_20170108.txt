[02:14:22] <Insentience> http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2010/02/17/clickoutside-jquery-plugin/ Can someone explain what line 9... is?
[03:41:54] <warlock> https://jsfiddle.net/k3vtuq09/ - the click() on #remove_subscription isn't really working out for me. I think I might have nested the function wrong in the initcomplete() section. Any ideas?
[03:42:15] <warlock> add_subscription works fine though, just not the remove_subscription
[10:02:41] <printFor_> t.
[10:03:06] <printForever> yo
[10:03:24] <printForever> I have created a function that for some reason is not firing on load in Firefox (Mac)
[10:03:38] <printForever> but the function is being triggered by Chrome and Safari just fine
[10:03:49] <printForever> it's placed in $(document).ready
[10:04:02] <printForever> is there a way I can force Mozilla Firefox to run the function?
[10:08:55] <printForever> any ideas?
[10:09:15] <printForever> what could be the issue with Firefox refusing to respect the code?
[10:16:20] <printForever> found it
[10:16:27] <printForever> I should have ran the function in the code.
[10:16:42] <printForever> Chrome assumes that the function should run even thought you didn't write it explicitly.

[14:52:16] <Sean24> hi. i am trying to develop a SVG drawing app using css/html/jquery. is anyone available for some pointers? i'm stuck and would really appreciate someone that can guide me as to what i should be looking for (i can rtfm and google all night if needed lol )
[14:53:17] <shoky> Sean24: you should know that jquery doesn't really support the SVG DOM - some stuff works but other stuff doesn't
[14:53:18] <madprops> I have added some text to a span using .text() because there are characters like < that i didn't want them to be rendered. But now I have to add some <a> tags around links .. how can I keep the message being text (not html) while the links being rendered as html?
[14:53:41] <shoky> Sean24: otherwise for jquery questions you can just feel free to ask. no need to ask to ask ;p
[14:53:43] <Sean24> i should but i don't. i'm a total noob in all that is programming
[14:54:31] <shoky> Sean24: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Won't-Fix#svg-or-vml
[14:54:37] <Sean24> i am trying to learn but i don't know where to start. so the school assignment is to use jquery.min.js
[14:55:02] <Sean24> i think my teacher was under the influence when he passed this assignment but i still have to try lol
[14:55:19] <shoky> lol
[14:55:37] <Sean24> shoky, thanks for the URL
[14:55:49] <Sean24> let me be more explicit and then i'll return to browsing the anals of the internet
[15:01:02] <Sean24> so. the school assignment is this: build an vectorial graphics editor using SVG. the example that was given to us was this one: https://www.catscarlet.com/site/svg-edit-2.8.1/svg-editor.html (hope i won't get banned for pasting this link though). ). what i was able to write until now is this: http://ase.softmentor.ro/svg.html . Unfortunately if you check the 2nd link (so my code) if you  click and hold the mouse and do a selection, th
[15:01:16] <Sean24> i need to be able to change that shape to a circle, an ellipse, a line, etc.
[15:01:33] <Sean24> unfortunately, the project requirements state that i do not use a canvas
[15:02:03] <Sean24> as blunt and stupid as it sounds, the project specs allows me only to use html/css/jquery/jscript
[15:03:11] <Sean24> now. i can draw a cirlcle in svg with a predefined radius, size, color, whatever. what i don't know is how to make the circle resize dynamically like the rectangle that i've already (shamefuly) implemented
[15:11:46] <shoky> Sean24: your long text got cut off after  " click and hold the mouse and do a selection, th"
[15:12:04] <Sean24> oh
[15:12:11] <Sean24> if you  click and hold the mouse and do a selection, the shape of the box is a rect [22:01] <Sean24> i need to be able to change that shape to a circle, an ellipse, a line, etc.
[15:12:18] <Sean24> sorry for that
[15:16:05] <shoky> Sean24: if you know the dimensions of the rectangle, it should be a simple calculation to get the circle dimensions, no?
[15:17:25] <Sean24> if i had to simply create a rectangle or a circle with a x size i could do it
[15:18:32] <Sean24> what i need to do is basically be able to draw multiple circles of various sizes on the same page (i won't call it a canvas) and their sizes to be dictated by mouse movement
[15:18:43] <Sean24> like when you open microsoft paint and use the circle tool
[15:19:37] <shoky> right.. what's the problem? :)
[15:19:50] <shoky> you'll probably want <ellipse> and not <circle> btw..
[15:20:01] <shoky> well depending on user choice i guess.
[15:20:35] <Sean24> the problem is i don't know how to implement what i said above haha
[15:22:21] <shoky> you only need to figure out what the ellipse's center is, and its x/y radius
[15:22:37] <shoky> can you figure out the center point?
[15:24:03] <shoky> you have the 2 corners of the rectangle
[15:24:11] <shoky> the center is in the middle :)
[15:39:22] <shoky> Sean24: anyways.. https://jsfiddle.net/0hf92dft/2/  try right-clicking your rectangles
[15:39:58] <Sean24> sorry, i was nose-deep reading
[15:40:06] <Sean24> lol for the jsfiddle link
[15:41:20] <Sean24> that's an elipse. it's a bit different than the circle
[15:41:44] <Sean24> the elipse is rounding the edges of the square
[15:41:58] <Sean24> of the rectangle actually
[15:42:04] <Sean24> ellipse* wtf
[15:46:00] <shoky> then do a circle ;p
[15:49:59] <Sean24> trying to figure out how. you made me feel bad for a sec because it only took you 5 minutes to do something i was googling for the past 8 hours lol
[15:50:30] <shoky> it's just some simple math :|
[15:50:42] <shoky> if you can't figure out the circle... you can look here ;p https://jsfiddle.net/0hf92dft/3/
[15:52:05] <Sean24> lol i was seriousyl working on it haha
[15:52:45] <shoky> keep at it then
[15:54:31] <Sean24> thanks alot though. you really helped because i can see the code and understand it. oh and about the 'it's just simple math' stuff. it's my first year studying programming and maths. i have an history major  :(
[15:54:34] <Sean24> a lot*
[16:07:58] <shoky> ah ok, i assumed you'd already done some math, my bad :)
[16:38:04] <Sean24> don't worry about it shoky. your help was much appreciated!
[17:07:42] <Sean24> shoky:  one more question if i'm not being an arsewipe. in your code if i'm trying to draw a circle, before the circle gets drawn the outline is still a rectangle. how can i modify that into a circle/line/ellipse? (only one and i'll catch on the rest)
[17:25:07] <shoky> Sean24: you change the rect to a circle, and set its attributes like i did for the circle
[17:35:46] <Sean24> thanks!
[18:12:53] <dglambert> yo
[18:52:27] <printForever> hi
[18:52:43] <printForever> Can I update .text() in an interval from an array?
[18:56:23] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/nka4226q/
[18:57:34] <printForever> do I use $.each?
[19:18:29] <printForever> I've managed to get it working, but it goes straight to the last element in the array.
[19:18:39] <printForever> I've used setTimeout after .each()
[19:24:56] <shoky> printForever: you mean this..? https://jsfiddle.net/nka4226q/1/
[19:25:06] <printForever> I've just created it :D
[19:25:10] <printForever> this very second
[19:27:23] <printForever> shoky https://jsfiddle.net/nka4226q/2/
[19:27:41] <printForever> it didn't want to work until I added 200 * i
[19:28:09] <shoky> mine is.. better ;p
[19:28:13] <printForever> Why did I need to add 200 * i, I mean "* i". Shouldn't it just wait 200ms between each iteration? I don't get why I needed to multiply it.
[19:28:32] <shoky> doesn't make much sense to do a loop (or .each) because those access the whole array right away in one shot.
[19:28:52] <shoky> what if you had 1000 in the array, you wouldn't want to really do setTimeout 1000 times right awawy
[19:29:13] <printForever> correct
[19:29:19] <shoky> printForever: because $.each doesn't wait for your setTimeout
[19:29:27] <printForever> ooooh
[19:29:29] <shoky> it runs through the whole thing right awawy
[19:30:07] <printForever> right
[19:30:19] <printForever> your code is better
[20:40:52] <moerkfaen> Hi! I'm trying to make a simple BitCoin currency converter like http://preev.com/: http://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/ywx6L9zn/1/
[20:40:55] <moerkfaen> But how do I make it so that whenever a value is typed in one input, the other input gets updated?
[21:34:17] <moerkfaen> How come I can't find #btc using $(this).is('btc') etc.? https://jsfiddle.net/x72njr1p/
[21:41:56] <moerkfaen> aah is('input#btc') works
