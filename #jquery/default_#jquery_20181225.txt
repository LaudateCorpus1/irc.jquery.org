[08:48:09] <spinningcat> result seems little bit awkward to me what do ya think? https://jsfiddle.net/5w4o2Lhq/
[15:10:53] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:40:59] <TeddyMurray> http://talkgods.com/ how do i include jquery in a reactjs app? see the console $ is not defined
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't really need jquery for a react app, no?
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> also: looks like your bundler may be misconfigured.
[17:45:29] <robertmaxrees> need to require or import or w/e for your particular script
[17:45:54] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, thanks ill look into that. i want to use jquery inside it though because im porting code that was jquery
[17:46:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd port it into react fwiw.
[17:46:12] <TeddyMurray> i guess i could do vanilla js though..
[17:46:15] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:46:23] <robertmaxrees> if you're using react, then use it wholesale imo.
[17:46:28] <TeddyMurray> hehe
[17:46:37] <TeddyMurray> its been a while since we've talked, how have you been robertmaxrees ?
[17:46:55] <robertmaxrees> eh.  i've been.
