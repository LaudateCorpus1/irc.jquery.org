[02:47:20] <Duikb00t> o/
[02:48:43] <Duikb00t> Im looking at this now for hours >< https://jsfiddle.net/87654knj/   and im not able to change it, why is my 'clone' not being added as div below the other one one '.product_data'? It gets cloned inside it
[02:49:19] <Duikb00t> I tried to 'appendTo(''.wrapper"); but without sucess.
[02:59:06] <kromwell> Hello, I am issuing a POST request ($.post(.....) ) , and the request is working just fine, but for some reason the success callback isn't being called
[02:59:08] <kromwell> http://pastebin.com/NBfkAXQp
[03:01:27] <Cork> kromwell: bind a fail callback
[03:05:24] <kromwell> Cork, I tried using a .done and .fail callback and they return syntax errors
[03:05:26] <kromwell> SyntaxError: syntax error
[03:05:26] <kromwell> 	
[03:05:26] <kromwell> .done(function() {
[03:05:45] <kromwell> http://pastebin.com/nCe5ZdSH
[03:06:04] <Cork> $.post().done(function(data) {}).fail(function() { /* the important one */ });
[03:06:40] <Cork> also please use jsfiddle.net
[03:10:06] <doug__> why does it reject? even with status code 200 it rejects! why is jqxhr promise acting so strangely? https://jsfiddle.net/88vrx2ka/2/
[03:11:17] <Cork> doug__: the server doesn't respond to OPTIONS requests
[03:11:22] <Cork> so the request is blocked
[03:11:33] <doug__> you assume? or checked in debugger
[03:11:41] <doug__> my debugger says green 201 Created
[03:11:44] <doug__> or 200 OK
[03:12:05] <Cork> opps sorry it was my client blocking the request (forgot to enable it..()
[03:12:15] <doug__> ah
[03:14:21] <Cork> doug__: you are replacing jquery deferred with promise
[03:14:27] <Cork> i don't think that's supported
[03:14:32] <Cork> not sure though
[03:14:50] <doug__> does jqxhr.then call those functions? if so it works
[03:15:27] <doug__> this is nearly a hello-world promise example, but the jqxhr then callbacks "point to" the new promise resolve reject
[03:15:40] <Cork> not sure why you do this
[03:15:43] <Cork> what's the point?
[03:15:47] <doug__> so it shouldnt need to "support" anything
[03:16:00] <doug__> to use jquery in a promise chain
[03:16:09] <doug__> and not get some jqxhr unresolved crap as value
[03:16:37] <doug__> I have to do .then(callback) in the .then callback? lol, no
[03:17:13] <kromwell> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/ddwgm9kr/2/
[03:17:13] <doug__> jqxhr.then calls the 1st argument with the response as 1st arg?
[03:17:24] <doug__> ...on success
[03:18:10] <doug__> it happens on same domain too
[03:18:17] <doug__> I dod cors crap so I could file jquery bug
[03:18:25] <doug__> and post a fiddle repro
[03:18:37] <Cork> kromwell: don't forget to define your variables
[03:19:51] <Cork> kromwell: https://jsfiddle.net/ddwgm9kr/3/
[03:19:54] <Cork> opps
[03:20:06] <Cork> kromwell: https://jsfiddle.net/ddwgm9kr/4/ that one should work
[03:21:08] <doug__> Cork: does jqxhr (call the first function you pass to .then) with (the JSON.parse'd response as the first argument) on success?
[03:21:31] <Cork> jqxhr doesn't really do anything deferred does
[03:21:53] <doug__> yes it does lol
[03:21:55] <Cork> jqxhr is just a deferred object with a few properties added
[03:22:03] <doug__> $.post returns jqxhr which has .then
[03:22:08] <doug__> and IS a deferred
[03:22:11] <doug__> and has .promise()
[03:23:07] <doug__> from the docs: The jqXHR objects returned by $.ajax() as of jQuery 1.5 implement the Promise interface, giving them all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see Deferred object for more information).
[03:24:43] <doug__> jqXHR.then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {}, function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {}); Incorporates the functionality of the .done() and .fail() methods, allowing (as of jQuery 1.8) the underlying Promise to be manipulated. Refer to deferred.then() for implementation details.
[03:26:26] <doug__> it does pass 3 arguments to the resolve. what would that do? maybe it is resolving with last arg
[03:26:47] <doug__> the native promise resolve I mean
[03:27:14] <doug__> that would totally explain it... let me check
[03:34:59] <doug__> yay! found it: https://jsfiddle.net/88vrx2ka/6/   it was 'application/json' not 'json'
[03:35:40] <doug__> it rejects the jqxhr itself in that scenario, with misleading 200 OK etc in it.
[03:36:22] <doug__> oops https://jsfiddle.net/88vrx2ka/7/
[03:39:28] <doug__> Cork: thanks for looking though. knowing a second set of eyes were on it helped :D
[04:06:34] <doug__> d2p isn't even needed btw, you can just .then right off the $.ajax return value. I did d2p because I was getting a weird reject argument
[05:41:52] <QssT> how can I identify if an unordered list contains a certain result?
[05:43:00] <Cork> QssT: "certain" ?
[06:17:33] <safinn> Can someone help me determine why the animations do not move at the same speed please? Example: https://jsfiddle.net/dgLxL2tr/2/ The animation stops when hover and resumes on no longer honver but they start moving at different speeds even though the numbers say different.
[06:17:54] <safinn> if we ignore the gaps, they stay the same distance apart but when you mouse over they pause which is fine but when you move the mouse they start overlapping.
[06:56:37] <safinn> Can someone help me determine why the animations do not move at the same speed please? Example: https://jsfiddle.net/dgLxL2tr/2/ The animation stops when hover and resumes on no longer honver but they start moving at different speeds even though the numbers say different.
[07:14:13] <Cork> safinn: your using timeouts in an animation
[07:14:19] <Cork> safinn: but you expect constant time
[07:14:39] <Cork> safinn: browsers reduces accuracy on timers when the window loses focus
[07:14:48] <Cork> so you can't build it like that
[07:16:54] <safinn> Cork, hey thanks for taking a look. not aware im using timeouts?
[07:17:15] <Cork> safinn: ya, i just took it from the effect it has
[07:18:32] <Cork> hmm actually, looking at it again, i might be wrong
[07:19:23] <Cork> safinn: btw don't store random attributes on the dom
[07:19:30] <Cork> use data-done instead of done
[07:19:48] <Cork> (also you might want to use .data() instead)
[07:20:24] <safinn> Cork, Will do! Does it make a difference other that following the standard?
[07:20:48] <Cork> safinn: it means future standards don't risk coliding with your value
[07:21:00] <Cork> .data can store none strings so it has a bigger effect
[07:21:33] <Cork> (it isn't directly stored on the dom so it can store any js object)
[07:21:45] <safinn> Cork, right i see.
[07:22:08] <Cork> but ya, every time you add a custom attribute it should _always_ be data- prefixed
[07:22:08] <safinn> Cork, so my maths is not wrong haha it's the method im using?
[07:22:21] <Cork> safinn: i'm still trying to figure it out
[07:22:31] <Cork> looks like it is the resume that fails
[07:23:06] <safinn> Correct. thats where im having the trouble.
[07:24:21] <safinn> The numbers i print seem correct (the time used in the animation, the translateValue).
[07:24:45] <Cork> safinn: anyway to start with: https://jsfiddle.net/dgLxL2tr/3/
[07:26:33] <safinn> Cork, thanks for adding the data attribute.
[07:26:34] <Cork> btw why don't you just write translateValue * -1 as -translateValue ?
[07:26:50] <safinn> Cork, haha good point! Will do that.
[07:27:26] <Cork> ah
[07:27:42] <Cork> time is the problem
[07:27:53] <Cork> safinn: you resume from a partial move over the animation
[07:28:03] <Cork> but you set the time to be for the full length
[07:28:20] <Cork> it needs to be time - <the length it has already moved>
[07:29:11] <safinn> Cork, right, let me get my head round it. The time is calculated from the  difference of the current position to the finishing position.
[07:29:50] <Cork> safinn: ah, damn missed that
[07:30:25] <safinn> the translateValue variable.
[07:30:31] <Cork> ya, i see that now
[07:30:55] <safinn> I'll be back in a few mins, door bell, sorry.
[07:31:11] <Cork> ya, i can't spend more time on it now anyway
[07:43:56] <ajf-> peeps any idea why this little code is not working on line 6? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4b9d008700e2fbd07579395cffaebd34#file-syncwordpresssettings-js-L6
[07:44:22] <ajf-> i'm just trying to sanitise some ugly attributes
[07:46:00] <ajf-> is that correct in the jquery world
[07:55:07] <ajf-> looks like it's because NamedNodeMap is another of those "not an array but actually kinda"
[07:56:02] <taplar> find('*').contents() is strange.
[07:58:33] <Duikb00t> How can I detected / make sure when I click on validate that it validates the right number? https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/mLgffhws/
[07:59:09] <taplar> find a shared parent, then search downwards
[07:59:20] <Duikb00t> Oh .find  = upwards no?
[07:59:29] <taplar> closest() is up
[07:59:39] <taplar> find() is down
[07:59:48] <ajf-> taplar it gets you the raw html elements afaik but still I'm using plain old $.each
[07:59:50] <Duikb00t> In this case a shared parent
[07:59:53] <ajf-> instead
[07:59:58] <Duikb00t> is .product data right?\
[08:00:09] <taplar> yah, your divs look to be the parent
[08:00:30] <taplar> ajf-: do you have a fiddle showing the issue?
[08:02:27] <ajf-> no but I think I got it https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3e028e29a8092515cb2e9778f9e884bf
[08:02:48] <ajf-> yep that one works
[08:03:05] <taplar> are you doing [] just to get to the prototype methods of map?
[08:03:21] <taplar> err, of array
[08:03:24] <Duikb00t> taplar:   console.log($(this).find('.product_data').closest('serial').val());
[08:03:36] <taplar> serial is down, and it's a class
[08:03:37] <Duikb00t> no
[08:03:38] <ajf-> yeah ?
[08:03:40] <Duikb00t> closest is up
[08:03:43] <ajf-> it's that bad ?
[08:03:49] <ajf-> should I do Array.prototype.map
[08:03:51] <taplar> ajf-: Array.prototype.map.call(...
[08:04:08] <taplar> no need to instantiate one
[08:04:38] <ajf-> is it too bad of a crime if it looks better
[08:04:46] <taplar> *shrug*  your call
[08:04:48] <Duikb00t> This works taplar   console.log($(this).closest('.product_data').find('.serial').val());
[08:04:50] <taplar> not critical
[08:04:58] <taplar> Duikb00t: :)
[08:05:37] <Duikb00t> oh?
[08:05:52] <taplar> sup?
[08:06:09] <Duikb00t> What do you mean with not critical
[08:06:19] <taplar> that was to ajf
[08:06:22] <Duikb00t> oh oK :D
[08:06:31] <Duikb00t> I have 1 large shitty issue left
[08:07:26] <taplar> ?
[08:08:14] <Duikb00t> But its js/php
[08:13:40] * taplar_brb zombie walks out of his cube saying "foooooooood"
[08:23:53] <Duikb00t> How can I do an AJAX call from a uknown name when I have to select the name?
[08:24:18] <taplar_brb> ?
[08:24:28] <Cork> uh, that question makes no sense
[08:28:35] <safinn> Cork, sorry about that. No worries buddy. Thanks for taking a look.
[08:30:09] <Duikb00t> To give an example: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/7r39b5th/
[08:30:27] <Duikb00t> The second element of HTML ( #product_1 ) is being cloned.
[08:30:40] <Duikb00t> When I validate the first one my ajax call works perfect
[08:30:50] <Duikb00t> When I click the validate button from the cloned one nothing happends, no error nothing
[08:30:58] <taplar> your probably not binding on the cloned one
[08:31:40] <taplar> put a console log at the start of your handler and see if it fires for the cloned elements
[08:32:09] <Duikb00t> At the one where I clone?
[08:32:18] <taplar> they should all use the same handler, no?
[08:32:40] <taplar> at the beginning of your click handler
[08:33:09] <taplar> actually you got your 'bleh' log in there
[08:33:15] <taplar> so that doesn't happen for the cloned ones?
[08:33:24] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/7r39b5th/1/    I got blegh 1 time
[08:33:41] <taplar> change your binding to be a delegate off of .wrapper
[08:34:52] <Duikb00t> We are talking about the the one that triggers the ajax call or the clone
[08:35:17] <taplar> i thought we were talking about the validate one.  the one that isn't working.... ?
[08:35:39] <Duikb00t> That's true
[08:35:52] <Duikb00t> But I was thinking maybe there was something wrong when I was cloning them.
[08:35:58] <Duikb00t> But ok, its in the validate click handler.
[08:37:01] <taplar> you understand that $('.validate') is not being continuously re-evaluated right?  that's part of the reason we use delegates
[08:37:47] <taplar> $('.validate') will find all the elements with that class when it is ran and put the binding on them
[08:37:59] <taplar> future elements with that class will not have that binding on them.  this includes clones
[08:38:00] <Duikb00t> So using $(document).on('click', '.validate', function() {
[08:38:07] <taplar> not document, too high
[08:38:09] <Duikb00t> will only take effect on the current clicked on
[08:38:10] <taplar> .wrapper
[08:38:20] <Duikb00t> $('.wrapper').on('click', '.validate', function() {
[08:38:32] <taplar> always delegate bind as low as possible
[08:39:55] <Duikb00t> That's really nice
[08:40:20] <Duikb00t> Thank you! It it working in reverse order as well?
[08:40:34] <taplar> huh?
[08:40:39] <Duikb00t> 1sec
[08:41:23] <Duikb00t> I was doing some small tests : Field 1: i gave a incorrect serial , Field 2  I gave a incorrect serial again. so I click validate and ( it just returns valid or invalid ) this class am I adding to the input element the closest to the validate button.
[08:41:34] <Duikb00t> But when I changed the field 2 to the correct one both changed to correct :P
[08:41:45] <Duikb00t> I was doing serial_no: $(this).closest('.product_data').find('.serial').val(),
[08:42:01] <Duikb00t> oh nvm
[08:42:10] <Duikb00t> $('.serial').addClass(response); says enough
[08:42:14] <taplar> :)
[08:42:21] <Duikb00t> It's being added everywheeeere
[08:42:27] <taplar> global lookup
[08:42:41] <Duikb00t> I should make use of this again and add it to the closest one
[08:43:01] <taplar> cache your serial lookup before you get the val.  reuse it for the class change
[08:43:32] <Duikb00t> $.cache /
[08:43:33] <Duikb00t> ?
[08:43:39] <taplar> store in a variable
[08:44:12] <Duikb00t> You mean in the data :  { object  }
[08:44:24] <taplar> var $serial = $(this).closest('.product_data').find('.serial');   $serial.val();    $serial.addClass('error');
[08:44:35] <taplar> variable
[08:45:40] <taplar> comprende?
[08:45:44] <Duikb00t> trying
[08:45:52] <Duikb00t> But I get what you mean
[08:46:06] <Duikb00t> so I don't have to find the whole way to the element again I can better put it in a var
[08:46:12] <taplar> yup
[08:47:31] <aiena> I am new to jquery. I wrote a bit of code to hide and show div's based on option button selected. When I do that jquery works fine. But there is sort of ghosting where there are buttons in firefox. I have not styled my site with css. There is no css just plain html and jquery JS
[08:48:21] <taplar> ghosting?
[08:48:22] <Duikb00t> Comprendo!
[08:48:29] <taplar> :D
[08:49:07] <aiena> taplar: e.g. suppose there was a button when I hide the dive a small Lshaped line remains where the button was on hiding the div
[08:49:23] <aiena> so it is the ghost outline of the button
[08:49:39] <aro> is tehre a way to use draggable/sortable to drop from a list to a table header
[08:49:47] <taplar> can you show me what your doing in a jsfiddle?  it sounds like your removing the text of the button and leaving the button visible
[08:50:05] <taplar> aro: draggable/sortable do not play well with <table>'s iirc
[08:50:51] <aro> i just dont want to drop it into a list
[08:51:00] <aro> i want to drop it into a column that is like a header row
[08:51:52] <taplar> you might can make it droppable on to a table and then manually do the logic to create the table row/column.  you'd have to look at the docs and experiment
[08:54:05] <aiena> taplar:  hmm its not running properly in fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/z3uqzb0z/ not sure how to fiddlize it
[08:54:10] <aiena> but code is the same
[08:54:56] <taplar> see the Javascript <cog icon> in the top right corner of the one textarea?
[08:55:02] <aiena> yes
[08:55:06] <taplar> click that guy, :)
[08:55:15] <aiena> then
[08:55:22] <taplar> select your jquery version
[08:55:53] <taplar> or a jquery version.  this is the way you can use jsfiddles provided jquery libraries instead of adding them yourself
[08:56:02] <aiena> hmm on fiddle there is no ghosting
[08:56:32] <taplar> so now you get to investigate more, :)
[08:56:57] <aiena> must be something to do with no css
[08:57:12] <aiena> jsfiddle's css must be preventing the ghosting from happening
[08:57:25] <taplar> jsfiddle isn't applying any css to it
[08:57:35] <taplar> that'd defeat the purpose of a sandbox
[08:57:52] <aiena> it isn't but the website has a bg color etc
[08:57:59] <aiena> so the css of jsfiddle itself not the code in it
[08:59:23] <taplar> uh, you can inspect every element in that iframe.  there is no css applied to it
[09:00:05] <aiena> ok what is funny
[09:00:16] <aiena> is why jsfiddle shows the same code in the same browser fine
[09:00:39] <aiena> but reloading almost identical code with the text content changed a bit causes ghosting
[09:00:57] <taplar> 'almost identical'
[09:01:39] <taplar> also fwiw, don't do $(this).attr("value")
[09:01:45] <taplar> use this.value or $(this).val()
[09:03:40] <skinux> How do I grab ahold of an element that has a data-toggle and make it show?
[09:03:59] <taplar> select it by a class or id
[09:04:13] <aro> okay
[09:04:14] <aro> so
[09:04:29] <aro> is there a way to basically create 6 droppable zones that can act as receivers of a list?
[09:05:01] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[09:05:20] <skinux> $("share-toggle").show(); ?
[09:05:49] <taplar> what is share-toggle?  if it's a class it needs a '.' in front.  if it's an id it needs a '#'
[09:06:08] <skinux> share-toggle is an ID
[09:06:12] <aiena> taplar:  see http://paste.opensuse.org/view/raw/65b4295e you can see that faint line at the bottom
[09:06:23] <aiena> that is like a silhouette of a button
[09:06:29] <skinux> Also, does jquery have a free cdn source I can reference?
[09:06:47] <aiena> I ran the same code in the same browser on jsfiddle and its not there
[09:06:52] <taplar> i believe there is a maxcdn for it.  you'd have to check their website.  there is also a google cdn that has them
[09:07:00] <Duikb00t> thx taplar fur help
[09:07:05] <taplar> sure
[09:07:23] <Duikb00t> I made some preg_match check in it as wel
[09:07:25] <Duikb00t> with ajax
[09:07:42] <taplar> aiena: inspect that ghost thing and see what it is.  look at the css on it too
[09:07:58] <taplar> kinda looks like an input box, not a button
[09:08:00] <aiena> taplar: there is no css it is plain html
[09:08:25] <aiena> not a single like no style sheet nothing
[09:08:37] <taplar> ok, still.  inspect it.  what is it?
[09:08:52] <Duikb00t> When having mutliple inputs with the same calss should I also do that binding stuff?
[09:09:08] <taplar> the delegate binding?
[09:09:14] <Duikb00t> Why? Because I have  $('.serial').mask('9999-999-999999-9999999999');
[09:09:29] <aiena> taplar: cant inspect it seems like a screen rendering bug I can safely ignore it
[09:09:31] <Duikb00t> Which works on only 1 now but every group has a .serial class on their input.
[09:09:44] <taplar> aiena: weird. :s
[09:09:45] <aiena> i mean how FF is rendering it
[09:09:56] <skinux> Anyway... $("#share-toggle").show(); will make it show?
[09:10:02] <aiena> I think maybe if I add a delay to the transition it may not repaint the screen so fast
[09:10:04] <taplar> skinux: try it and see, :)
[09:10:26] <taplar> Duikb00t: you can't do that with a delegate.  that's not a binding
[09:10:34] <taplar> you'd have to do that for each serial when you clone
[09:11:01] <Duikb00t> Do what exactly?
[09:11:07] <taplar> your mask function
[09:11:42] <Duikb00t> That works
[09:11:49] <Duikb00t> Lol still the validation is doing weird things :D
[09:12:04] <Duikb00t> When it's jumping from input to input ( where the validate button belongs to )
[09:12:20] <skinux> How do I connect the onclick of a text link to a JS function? $(element).click(...); ?
[09:12:52] <taplar> avoid doing inline onclick.  just change it to be the $(element).on('click', ..
[09:14:12] <taplar> Duikb00t: what do you mean jumping?
[09:14:59] <Duikb00t> The issue is have is that the once I click  an other 'Validate' button the previous one is loosing the 'added' class by ajax
[09:15:21] <taplar> sounds like your changing things outside your scope
[09:15:30] <taplar> update your fiddle?
[09:15:39] <Duikb00t> I was
[09:15:40] <Duikb00t> fixed
[09:16:29] <Duikb00t> http://i.imgur.com/9uiv454.png sweet taplar
[09:16:50] <taplar> :)
[09:16:59] <Duikb00t> <3
[09:17:08] <Duikb00t> You see on top there is a checkbox?
[09:17:12] <Duikb00t> ( its only a few pixels )
[09:17:19] <taplar> kinda
[09:17:46] <Duikb00t> The horrible thing about this all is when I check another checkbox and I add items and then click submit it's not nice how things got shown in PHP.
[09:17:49] <aiena> taplar: what do you mean by avoid inline click what is the correct way
[09:17:53] <Duikb00t> I would like to group them some more
[09:18:20] <Duikb00t> [product][x]   [product][x][serial][x]     [product][x][address][x]
[09:18:50] <taplar> aiena: <htmltag onclick="something()" />  <-- this is an inline binding.  typically this should be avoid for various reasons
[09:19:21] <taplar> you want to do your binding in your javascript to segregate your markup from your logic, keep your logic together, and also it opens the possibility for delegate bindings
[09:19:35] <taplar> are you familiar with how to bind event handlers in jquery?
[09:19:45] <aro> i need droppable to drop into designated target 'zones' not a list
[09:19:48] <aro> is there a way to handle that?
[09:19:51] <aiena> no brand bew to jquery need to learn it
[09:19:59] <aiena> new
[09:20:02] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/   boom
[09:20:16] <taplar> also give the rest of the site a gander.  lots of good info
[09:21:32] <Duikb00t> if checkbox:checked remove   then show all items bellowwwwww
[09:22:37] <safinn> Maybe someone can help me figure out why my animations start at different speeds and start overlapping after being resumes from stopped: https://jsfiddle.net/dgLxL2tr/3/ On hover they stop fine but when resumed using the resume method they move at different speeds and overlap.
[09:25:19] <Duikb00t> taplar:  When I have default display: none; on my element and when I trigger the checkbox I show them.
[09:25:24] <Duikb00t> ( all good )
[09:25:51] <Duikb00t> But what if I submit my form, I go BACK with the <- arrow in my browser, what triggers that state? Because they are checked then but not shown.
[09:27:40] <taplar> i'm not intimately familiar with how the back button works in regards to javascript.  i know it can cause problems though
[09:28:21] <taplar> if he is free Cork may know more, :)
[09:28:41] <Cork> hmm?
[09:28:58] <taplar> javascript and the browser back button.
[09:29:09] <taplar> does the script get re-executed?
[09:29:10] <Cork> browsers tend to remember the state of checkboxes
[09:29:23] <Cork> you need to execute javascript that depends on checkbox state on page load
[09:29:44] <Cork> alternatively you can set autocomplete="off" on the checkbox and it will reset
[09:29:51] <Cork> (when back is used i mean)
[09:29:52] <Duikb00t> oh really?
[09:29:58] <Duikb00t> hmm
[09:30:04] <Cork> same for f5
[09:31:09] <Cork> what i tend to do is $(form).on('change update', '.checkbox-types', func); $(form).find('.checkbox-types').trigger('update');
[09:31:33] <Cork> (note that triggering change on a radio button or checkbox changes them)
[09:32:26] <Duikb00t> Indeed Cork Adding autocomplete="off"  works
[09:32:45] <fission6> how would i set up the call backs to do something like the following: have a user click a button to call some handler BUT before calling that handler present a modal for confirmation that the user really wants to do the event
[09:33:20] <Cork> fission6: you have to abort the event and if possible fire it again
[09:33:30] <Cork> fission6: if it is ex. click on a link you can't
[09:33:51] <fission6> thats an interesing approach wasn't expecting that
[09:34:15] <fission6> not sure it would work well in tis set up basically i have a click handler on the button but before doing the code in the click handler i want to confirm with a Modal
[09:35:02] <Cork> fission6: also note that if you're working with a form you SHOULD use submit on the form not click on the button
[09:35:11] <Cork> (not saying you are, but ...)
[09:35:20] <fission6> its a button
[09:35:23] <fission6> not in a form
[09:35:29] <Cork> and no input fields?
[09:35:32] <fission6> no
[09:35:33] <Cork> k
[09:35:41] <Cork> well then you don't care about the original event at all
[09:35:54] <Cork> just run what was in the event handler in the callback from the modal
[09:36:41] <fission6> the i ssue is that when the button is clicked it has data-attributes
[09:36:59] <fission6> i need those for the call back handler so i know what to submit to the webservice
[09:37:58] <Cork> so store them in a variable and pass them on from the scope
[09:38:09] <Cork> or you could just do var self = this; and use self in the callback
[09:38:17] <moldy> so what is the right way to parse a querystring with jquery / javascript?
[09:38:31] <moldy> do i really have to use an external library for that or totally reinvent the wheel?
[09:39:37] <taplar_afk> key=value&key=value string?
[09:39:44] <moldy> yes
[09:39:54] <Cork> moldy: yes you do
[09:40:06] <moldy> Cork: meh. thanks though.
[09:40:06] <Cork> jquery doesn't provide any search parsing
[09:40:28] <Cork> it is rarely needed (and jquery is meant for dom manipulation not url manipulation)
[09:40:38] <moldy> it's hilarious that this isn't part of javascript... languages that do *not* focus on the web have this in their stdlib :(
[09:41:06] <Cork> moldy: javascript rarely need to parse param stings
[09:41:21] <moldy> well it's not the first time i need this
[09:41:30] <decx> you want deparam?
[09:41:33] <Cork> well i have too, but it is like 15 projects a part...
[09:41:48] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to prevent sending empty fields when you submit a form?
[09:41:49] <moldy> often enough to have it in the stdlib, by my standard
[09:41:50] <Cork> so it comes way down at the bottom of commonly needed
[09:42:08] <Cork> Duikb00t: you can set them disabled
[09:42:20] <moldy> but well, this is why we end up with things like left-pad :p
[09:42:32] <Cork> Duikb00t: empty fields needs to be sent normally, else you can't clear a value
[09:42:45] <Duikb00t> when tvalid point
[09:42:48] <Duikb00t> valid point*
[09:42:50] <moldy> it's just so much wasted effort that everyone has to reimplement this or waste hours researching + testing existing solutions :(
[09:42:56] <Cork> moldy: stdlib has a WAY different situation
[09:43:06] <Cork> moldy: it doesn't need to be sent to the user on every visit
[09:43:12] <Cork> jquery does
[09:43:24] <Duikb00t> Cork:  https://www.pastery.net/nbecfu/ :P is just not that nice
[09:43:37] <Cork> so you don't want things in there (especially complex things like parsing params) unless it is very commonly needed
[09:43:54] <moldy> Cork: yeah, i'd prefer to have this as part of the actual javascript engine in the browser
[09:44:11] <moldy> then again, jquery is often cached
[09:44:22] <Cork> moldy: propose it as a new method for es7
[09:44:37] <moldy> ah well, i guess i will add https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl as another dependency
[09:44:39] <decx> to split location.seach?
[09:44:55] <moldy> to parse it, yes
[09:45:00] <decx> deparam
[09:45:08] <Cork> decx: sadly if you need to support all edge cases it becomes much more complext then splitting
[09:45:33] <moldy> decx: thanks. so deparam or purl, it is.
[09:49:56] <fission6> moldy: curious what you are doing since i am assuming django server side
[09:51:39] <moldy> fission6: yeah. the thing i'm working on is a mess though :o
[09:52:27] <moldy> fission6: basically, i have a page with a js ui, and i need to generate a permalink for a certain state of that ui
[09:53:28] <moldy> i should probably be using a big js framework like angular or react for this, but for "project management reasons" i am doing this with pure js + jquery
[09:54:18] <fission6> i see
[09:54:21] <fission6> sounds fun :/
[09:55:12] <moldy> yeah luckily this is one of the last features i need to finish :p
[09:55:27] <moldy> ok, purl doesn't work as documented, it seems
[09:57:36] <decx> react doesnt have a router built in either
[09:57:39] <aro> why is it that when i drag and drop something, if i grab it again - it appears about 1" above my mouse cursor?
[09:59:27] <moldy> deparam works -- thanks for the recommendation decx
[10:01:54] <aro> if i move across dropzones, it jumps away from the cursor
[10:38:12] <aro> is there a way to move nodes
[10:44:21] <skinux> Hmm. I set onClick for a link, but instead of executing JS it is trying to load the href
[10:45:08] <skinux> onClick="writeComment(this, '#post-comment-{!! $post->id !!}')"
[10:45:16] <AdamPDotty> so you do not want a link
[10:45:26] <aro> return false
[10:45:37] <aro> after your jibberish
[10:45:44] <skinux> I want a link, but I want it to make something else show, not load another page.
[10:45:48] <aro> onclick="writeComment(this, '#post-comment-{!! $post->id !!}'); return false;"
[10:46:12] <AdamPDotty> that is not a link then. A link links to another page or another part of the page.
[10:46:22] <aro> i agree with AdamPDotty
[10:46:24] <skinux> return false didn't make any difference
[10:46:33] <kevr> Hello.
[10:46:44] <aro> then bind a listener to it, or better yet - create another element like a button
[10:46:48] <aro> and style it to look like a link
[10:46:53] <aro> that way you dont have to worry about it
[10:47:02] <aro> or set href in your link to #
[10:47:08] <AdamPDotty> irgs
[10:47:08] <aro> but thats not a great idea either
[10:47:27] <skinux> I'm not sure how to bind a listener to it, because the ID includes post ID....should I put the binding JS script inside the PHP loop for posts?
[10:47:30] <aro> just throwing it out there since you seem to be okay with throwing conventions aside
[10:47:48] <aro> skinux: you are in a jquery channel. use jquery
[10:47:49] <Duikb00t> I have to change a name value from the latest add input from a div that has been cloned
[10:47:58] <Duikb00t> I think I know how to do that but im not sure where I should add it
[10:48:17] <aro> $(function() { $('a').click(function(e) { // do stuff here ; e.preventDefault(); }); });
[10:48:23] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/cysfdg/     this is what I have now
[10:48:40] <aro> put that in a <script> block in your page somewhere.. depending on how you have your page set up to load resources
[10:48:42] <kevr> I have this method, which is called when an $.ajax call is finished on an input handler
[10:48:46] <kevr> http://sprunge.us/SjZa?js
[10:48:51] <aro> it will execute on dom ready
[10:48:55] <kevr> However, it doesn't fadeOut or fadeIn properly.
[10:49:03] <skinux> aro...yeah that would work except that to select the link element requires the specific post ID
[10:49:13] <kevr> in fact, it looks like it's beginning to fadeOut or fadeIn, but then the element instantly appears without a fade
[10:49:24] <aro> skinux
[10:49:30] <aro> then add a data attribute to your anchor tag
[10:49:41] <skinux> It has data-toggle
[10:49:41] <aro> data-post-id="<?= $post->ID ?>"
[10:49:47] <aro> then in your listener
[10:49:56] <aro> $(this).data('post-id')
[10:50:05] <aro> that will contain your post id that was set by php
[10:50:13] <aro> read more about unobtrusive js
[10:50:23] <aro> that way you have one handler for all your links
[10:50:43] <aro> and if i were you, id modify the one i gave you to only apply to certain anchors. not all fo them
[10:50:46] <skinux> I put data-post-id into the element that I want to show or into the link that I want to show it?
[10:50:48] <aro> so add a class that you can select on
[10:51:18] <aro> <a href="whatever" data-post-id="<?= $post->ID ?>" class="click-handler">click me for good times</a>
[10:52:17] <aro> then in your handler... $('a.click-handler').click(function(event) { var postId = $(this).data('post-id'); //do more stuff here; event.preventDefault(); //<-- that will prevent the default link action from executing }); });
[10:52:35] <aro> ignore that last }); . put this inside your domready function
[10:53:15] <aro> does that make sense?
[10:56:32] <Duikb00t> I would like to increment numbers but limited to the divs wrapped around the elements that I clone
[10:57:17] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/ndnmud/  this is what currently happends.
[10:57:24] <skinux> Here is the relevent code...it's not working https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/5ec945f17cca12c1f2ca4978051b5e7b
[10:57:36] <Duikb00t> Around every number is a wrapper div
[10:58:24] <taplar_afk> Duikb00t: make a fiddle bro
[10:59:55] <Duikb00t> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/28/
[11:00:54] <Duikb00t> But I have to mention
[11:01:05] <Duikb00t> product[productname_01][0][serial_no]
[11:01:31] <Duikb00t> is being rendered from the PHP side so the [0] should be incremented by the 'added' elements in each .wrapper ><
[11:03:07] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/29/   added the correct names in the  example now
[11:14:23] <Duikb00t> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/30/
[11:14:32] <Duikb00t> Line 13 of the JS
[11:15:21] <km4> anyone use git ?
[11:15:49] <km4> I add reset to commit in another branch and now I cant pull my own
[11:16:28] <Duikb00t> km4:  go #git
[11:18:20] <km4> git reset --hard origin/master
[11:18:23] <km4> ok work now ;)
[11:21:37] <safinn> Hi, I'm trying to animate (translateX) some items and when hovering they stop and when the mouse moves away they carry on. Here is what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/dgLxL2tr/3/ They scroll along fine and pause when hover but when resumuing the speed changes and they start overlapping. Anyone have any ideas?
[11:35:10] <kevr> for some reason .fadeOut and .fadeIn aren't fading anything, but they're just popping the elements in and out of the DOM visibily
[11:35:23] <kevr> is this intended?..
[11:41:37] <kevr> perhaps i just need to debounce this operation.
[11:42:54] <kevr> grr.
[11:43:05] <robertmaxrees> goooooooooood morning #jquery
[11:43:30] <aro> if i have a div with a group of classes [enabled and disabled] - how would i move all the items with the class 'enabled' to the front of the nodelist while preserving the order?
[11:43:36] <aro> http://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/vKWvkB
[11:43:41] <aro> i have that created so far
[11:44:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd simplify it: $('disabled').each(function() { $theParent.find('enabled').last().append($(this)); })
[11:44:51] <robertmaxrees> errr, .after, not .append
[11:44:56] <AcidRain> https://jsfiddle.net/xp943Lgk/   i can not get delegation to work on the + when attempting to add an answer
[11:45:01] <AcidRain> doesnt fire at all
[11:45:25] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain because you're binding to .question
[11:45:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to bind to an element that exists on pageload.
[11:46:44] <aro> robertmaxrees was that for me
[11:46:56] <robertmaxrees> aro the simplified version, yes.
[11:47:04] <robertmaxrees> it'd be something like that, at least.
[11:47:19] <aro> cool
[11:47:21] <aro> thanks
[11:47:22] <aro> that works
[11:49:06] <gmurop> I am using a bootstrap modal, and when I hide it I take the .modal-body and place it in another div, and when I show it I took that content from the another div and put it in the .modal body. When I repeat this action several times sometimes happens that I hide the modal and the content is not incrusted in the another div, then I show it and is empty.
[11:49:10] <kevr> ugh..
[11:49:14] <gmurop> This is my hide function:
[11:49:15] <gmurop> $('#modal_documento').on('hide.bs.modal', function (e) {
[11:49:15] <gmurop> 	var $this = $(this);
[11:49:15] <gmurop> 	var id_documento = $this.attr('documento-padre');
[11:49:15] <gmurop> 	var $wrapper = $this.find('.modal-body');
[11:49:15] <gmurop> 	var $container = $('#' + id_documento).prev('.popover_content_wrapper');
[11:49:15] <gmurop> 	$container.html($wrapper.children('.container'));
[11:49:16] <gmurop> 	$container.hide();
[11:49:16] <gmurop>     });
[11:49:17] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[11:49:21] <kevr> gmurop: use a pastebin service.
[11:49:22] <robertmaxrees> gmurop hey don't paste in the channel.
[11:49:24] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:49:29] <gmurop> Sorry
[11:49:42] <gmurop> I forgot the rules, I'm sorry
[11:50:23] <robertmaxrees> heh, just remember, if you're pasting more than one line at a time, lots of people will get each one as a separate message, so they might get a rapid succession of sounds alerting them or w/e
[11:55:50] <AcidRain> how do i say.... .parent().closest("div").class("question") huh....
[11:56:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:56:16] <robertmaxrees> what do you think .class('question') will do?
[11:56:18] <AcidRain> trying to get the closest div whos class is 'question'
[11:56:28] <AcidRain> i think it will do nothing lol
[11:56:30] <robertmaxrees> .closest('div.question');
[11:56:36] <kevr> wow wtf, in jsfiddle the fading works great
[11:56:38] <robertmaxrees> .closest() takes the same selectors that $() takes.
[11:56:44] <AcidRain> ah
[11:56:45] <AcidRain> thx
[11:57:04] <robertmaxrees> any time a jquery method/function takes a selector, it supports the whole gamut.
[12:01:09] <kevr> changing the html of an element being faded out and in shouldnt affect the fade should it?
[12:02:27] <kevr> i wonder if the ajax-ness nature of my operation is screwing it up
[12:02:41] <someboy> Hi
[12:02:56] <someboy> moving from 1.8.0 to 2.x ...how many things will it break?
[12:03:14] <someboy> 2.0 to be more safe
[12:18:46] <kevr> I think it's the ajax call that's interrupting the animation.
[12:23:47] <AcidRain> so, current = $(this).closest("div.answer");  still finds something up the dom tree even tho its not there.
[12:24:08] <robertmaxrees> does it?
[12:24:12] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming that?
[12:24:45] <AcidRain> cause when i alert() it, it returns [object Object]
[12:25:00] <robertmaxrees> 2 things; 1 - use console.log()
[12:25:06] <robertmaxrees> 2: you want the length
[12:25:21] <robertmaxrees> empty jquery objects are still valid jquery objects.
[12:25:26] <robertmaxrees> they just don't have any elements in then.
[12:25:32] <robertmaxrees> so current.length
[12:29:42] <AcidRain> <div class='answer'> <div class='answer_move_up'>^</div></div>   ok, i have it like this. so i think i fixed 1 problem
[12:29:56] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[12:29:59] <AcidRain> i had to do $(this).parent().closest("div.answer");
[12:30:12] <robertmaxrees> shouldn;t need to...
[12:30:23] <AcidRain> which i think is still .answer_move_up's parent
[12:30:42] <AcidRain> i checked the length, its 1
[12:30:43] <robertmaxrees> you can still just .closest('.answer')
[12:31:00] <robertmaxrees> is the handler bound to answer_move_up?
[12:31:14] <AcidRain> then i should have to do .closest('.answer').closest('.answer'); ?
[12:31:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:31:23] <AcidRain> yes sir
[12:31:36] <robertmaxrees> then .closest('.answer') should be fine.
[12:43:09] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/xp943Lgk/1/
[12:43:24] <AcidRain> it still moves up when there is nothing above it. and still has a length of 1
[12:43:57] <AcidRain> the answer can be moved above the + and above the Question
[12:45:56] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:46:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean for all these vars to ber global?
[12:46:30] <AcidRain> no sir
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> lol why do you keep calling me "sir"?
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> and you're missing var declarations on all these.
[12:47:32] <AcidRain> i call u sir because you are of higher superiority in jquery
[12:47:34] <AcidRain> =)
[12:47:39] <robertmaxrees> pfff.
[12:47:41] <robertmaxrees> no need for that hahaha
[12:48:20] <robertmaxrees> so you're really confused about what .closest() does :)
[12:48:26] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[12:48:34] <AcidRain> i thought it only goes up the dom tree
[12:48:36] <robertmaxrees> nvm sorry.  this markup is confused.
[12:48:37] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:49:12] <skypce> hey guys, how can i do this http://codepen.io/skypce/pen/NAwoBO
[12:50:16] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain so this is really confusingly done.  do you mean for the + to add an input tot ehsame .question?
[12:50:33] <AcidRain> yes
[12:51:10] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain  and you're aware that $(this).closest(".answer"); is only going to the parent answer, so it's not going to move any more after getting to the top of the current .question group, yeah?
[12:51:16] <robertmaxrees> skypce you mean $('html')?
[12:52:08] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, right. so it should be movable to the top of the question group, but NOT above the question itself
[12:52:17] <robertmaxrees> right.  which is seems like it's doing?
[12:52:37] <AcidRain> :/ is it doing that for u? chrome?
[12:52:45] <robertmaxrees> ff
[12:52:50] <AcidRain> let me try in ff
[12:52:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't see how this is broken i guess.
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> it'll be the same in both ff and chrome fwiw.
[12:53:34] <AcidRain> yeah. its not working. the answer can still be moved above the question
[12:55:05] <robertmaxrees> this is really confusing.
[12:55:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:40] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, https://postimg.org/image/mvm8ivu5j/
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm really not grokking what you're trying to accomp0lish i guess.
[12:57:37] <AcidRain> i mean i guess it rly doesnt matter. this is for an admin section. so i could jsut tell the admins to not hit the "up" button again once its at the top of the answer group unless u want the answer to appear before the question lol
[12:57:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:57:48] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea, too.
[12:59:16] <AcidRain> yeah, ordering these properly is everything if im going to rely on the index of the input within a certain div to know what question an answer belongs to when i construct the POST data for saving this
[12:59:46] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is just the up/down arrows, right?
[13:00:15] <AcidRain> the down actually works great. it doesnt go down any further once it reaches the bottom of the answer group
[13:00:22] <AcidRain> only the up arrow is broken
[13:00:48] <AcidRain> actually i take that back. the down/up arrows are both broken
[13:01:44] <robertmaxrees> .prev() isn't doing what you think it is.
[13:02:04] <AcidRain> grrrr no wait. down works as expected. up does not
[13:02:43] <robertmaxrees> because your markup isn't structure the way you think it is.
[13:02:52] <AcidRain> i think .prev() would do what i think it is supposed to be doing if there wasnt a .closest('.answer'); when theres not
[13:02:55] <robertmaxrees> add_answer is the previous sibling to .answer()
[13:02:58] <robertmaxrees> err, .answer
[13:03:06] <robertmaxrees> errr, .add_answer.
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> .closest9) is doing exactly what it should be.
[13:03:21] <robertmaxrees> it is not your problem.
[13:03:44] <robertmaxrees> current.prev().before(current); is inserting before the prior .add_answer, then the prior .answer
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> basically, your markup structure isn't what you're expecting.
[13:04:44] <AcidRain> my brain
[13:04:45] <AcidRain> lol
[13:05:42] <robertmaxrees> it's easy.  you're confused about your html.
[13:06:28] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/1941f7f1f5b8
[13:06:39] <robertmaxrees> so if you add 4 answers, this is what you get.
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> see the problem?
[13:09:01] <AcidRain> actually no. i dont
[13:09:14] <robertmaxrees> let me flesh that out some more.
[13:09:24] <AcidRain> all opening .answer's have a closing div where they should be
[13:09:32] <robertmaxrees> that's not the problem i'm referencing.
[13:09:40] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about what .prev() is selecting.
[13:10:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m07ur7fs/
[13:10:45] <robertmaxrees> look at this html.
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> so as you click .answer_move_up, you're grabbing the parent and injecting it before its .prev() sibling, right?
[13:11:47] <AcidRain> right
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> so what happens when you click up on the top .answer ?
[13:12:28] <robertmaxrees> the .prev() is <div class="add_answer">+</div>
[13:12:35] <AcidRain> it gets injected before add_answer
[13:13:12] <robertmaxrees> bingo.  your markup structure is all kinds of awkward :) i'd add a container after add_answer called something like .allanswers and go from there.
[13:13:21] <AcidRain> BUT, what i dont understand, is $(this).closest(".answer");  if its the top answer, where is the .closest('.answer') ?
[13:13:33] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:13:39] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating "top" with "ancestor.
[13:14:16] <AcidRain> alright alright. let me change this
[13:14:26] <robertmaxrees> when you click .answer_move_up and do .closest('.answer'), you're getting the parent .answer element.
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> not the previous one, but the ancestor.
[13:14:51] <robertmaxrees> if you add that container for answers, you can clean things up a little.
[13:16:20] <arc_> there's a bunch of stuff in here that i would do differently
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:16:46] <robertmaxrees> but instead of ripping the entire thing apart and saying "nah just rewrite it", i'ma go with the "learn some lessons and do it better next time" :)
[13:17:16] <arc_> like adding a class to select instead of using a property selector
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> but he said yesterday that he can't rely on classes in this case.
[13:18:33] <arc_> and creating a new element by doing newDiv = $('<div>'); newDiv.addClass('question'); etc instead of typing it all out in html on one line
[13:18:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a templating engine instead for that.
[13:18:50] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, that worked
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain yep :)
[13:19:14] <AcidRain> amazing
[13:19:24] <AcidRain> thats why you are addressed as 'sir'
[13:19:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:19:34] <robertmaxrees> i actually really hate being called "sir"
[13:19:48] <arc_> btw this is less of a jquery thing and more of a general programming logic issue
[13:20:31] <AcidRain> i come in like var sir = $("#jquery").find('.sir'); console.log(sir); object: { name: "robertmaxrees" }
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:21:17] <taplar> late to the show but personally i'd split up the icons for the up/down and delete.  along with get some actual icons
[13:21:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:21:39] <robertmaxrees> and put 'em in anchors.
[13:22:03] <arc_> i'm sure this is temp layout
[13:22:51] <AcidRain> it is :)
[13:26:05] <taplar> was scoping down mentioned?
[13:26:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:26:33] <taplar> not a var in site
[13:26:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:26:41] <robertmaxrees> i mentioned that.
[13:33:41] <geri> hi is there a way to check if the following property is enabled? $('#myCanvas').css('cursor', 'none');
[13:34:14] <arc_> i'm not sure what you mean by enabled, but you can check the cursor property by using .css('cursor')
[13:34:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:35:04] <geri> like that? $('#myCanvas').is('[cursor=none]')   ?
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> ... no.
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> .css('cursor') === 'none'
[13:35:40] <geri> oh i see
[13:35:50] <taplar> so you actually want it to be none or are you trying to unset it?
[13:35:59] <geri> robertmaxrees: is there a way to disable mouse movements?
[13:36:10] <geri> events beeing send
[13:36:22] <arc_> sounds like this is for a game?
[13:36:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:36:27] <geri> yeah
[13:36:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:37:12] <geri> robertmaxrees: do you understand?
[13:37:38] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:37:53] <geri> i use the mouse to select objects using mouse over
[13:38:15] <geri> but in a task i need the mouse to be deactivated ...so hide + no mouse events enabled
[13:38:28] <robertmaxrees> that's... a tall order.
[13:38:48] <arc_> are you using any libraries
[13:38:58] <geri> no
[13:40:07] <geri> i guess i could remove my listener: obj.removeEventListener(type, fn, false);
[13:40:27] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, back WAAAAY up - so you want to disable a listener?
[13:41:24] <geri> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:41:39] <geri> robertmaxrees: sim.addEvent(this.outputcanvas, 'mousemove', this.control.onmove.bind(this.control));
[13:41:39] <robertmaxrees> that's different from what you were asking before :)
[13:41:49] <geri> robertmaxrees: i just realized
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery or...?
[13:42:01] <geri> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:42:09] <robertmaxrees> so then use jquery event bindings instead.
[13:43:19] <geri> robertmaxrees: ok
[13:43:33] <Duikb00t-ome> ohoh
[13:43:41] <geri> robertmaxrees: example?
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:44:02] <robertmaxrees> so you're not using jquery?
[13:44:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused about what's going on here lol
[13:44:45] <geri> robertmaxrees: i do
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) the docs are pretty clear then.
[14:05:06] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[14:05:32] <robertmaxrees> Hello!
[14:05:41] <GeekMonkey> Anyone run into an issue where overflow:hidden; doesn't work in FF
[14:05:47] <GeekMonkey> FF = FireFox
[14:05:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:05:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean, not if i'm using it right.
[14:06:08] <GeekMonkey> argh.... it is not working for me
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> might hit up #css if you're having problems.
[14:06:28] <taplar> and inspect the element and make sure it's not being overridden
[14:06:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:06:39] <robertmaxrees> and that you're actually setting height and stuff correctly.
[14:07:42] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees does it need a height
[14:08:10] <robertmaxrees> how else would it know when to stop allowing the overflow?
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> like. https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cygfat94/ this wouldn't make sense.
[14:09:34] <roger_padactor> http://pastebin.com/0r3nWqHP  inArray doesn't seem to work for first item passed in, or am i missing something.
[14:10:04] <taplar> does in array return the index?
[14:10:06] <taplar> 0 is falsey
[14:10:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you want > -1
[14:10:43] <roger_padactor> oh it does Sh&*t
[14:14:24] <GeekMonkey> https://jsfiddle.net/h1uxs5yq/4/
[14:14:46] <GeekMonkey> This does what I want in FF
[14:15:52] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:18:29] <GeekMonkey> ah ... I figured it out I am using fixed instead of absolute
[14:28:28] <gmurop> I bind an element to a plugin kind $("#element").elevateZoom() when I click a checkbox, how do I unbind that plugin when I uncheck the checkbox?
[14:31:17] <glowdemon1> Can't find why my button wont work https://jsfiddle.net/crs2mags/
[14:33:27] <glowdemon1> Hold on
[14:33:32] <glowdemon1> I didn't include jQuery in that fiddle
[14:36:51] <glowdemon1> Disregard, it works on jsFiddle, but not in my project
[14:37:21] <gmurop> Maybe you are not including correctly the jquery library
[14:38:07] <gmurop> Put your code inside $(document).ready(function() { //Here });
[14:44:37] <glowdemon1> Found it, the element was newly created and the event wasn't added to it
[14:45:01] <glowdemon1> But it did work in jsfiddle because the element wasn't newly created
[14:45:27] <taplar> fk!  a glow demon!
[14:55:05] <skinux> Would someone tell me what's wrong with my code please https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/5ec945f17cca12c1f2ca4978051b5e7b
[14:55:50] <skinux> Oh, wait..I see my answer
[14:59:08] <Alderin> Sometimes, all it takes is asking the question. :-)
[15:06:54] <Revolted> Hi
[15:07:01] <Revolted> someone from Br?
[15:11:16] <skinux> What is the API to tell jquery to show an div? .show() isn't working
[15:17:28] <Revolted> an exemple:
[15:17:31] <Revolted> <script>
[15:17:31] <Revolted> $( "div:visible" ).click(function() {
[15:17:31] <Revolted>   $( this ).css( "background", "yellow" );
[15:17:33] <Revolted> });
[15:17:35] <Revolted> $( "button" ).click(function() {
[15:17:37] <Revolted>   $( "div:hidden" ).show( "fast" );
[15:17:39] <Revolted> });
[15:17:41] <Revolted> </script>
[15:18:06] <Uhkis> Revolted: please never paste to irc again
[15:18:27] <Revolted> sorry..
[15:18:35] <Revolted> flood?
[15:19:12] <Uhkis> Revolted: use http://jsfiddle.net
[15:19:42] <Revolted> Uhkis: ok.. tks....
[15:20:22] <skinux> how about if I'm selecting the div by ID?
[15:21:39] <skinux> Wait a minute. Look at my gist and then tell me how to make the div show https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/5ec945f17cca12c1f2ca4978051b5e7b
[15:30:37] <safinn> I cant seem to work out why the animations start changing speed after they have been stopped with hover. They should carry on at the same speed. Here is the example: http://jsfiddle.net/dgLxL2tr/4/
[15:32:32] <darcyclarke> vladikoff miketaylr just got here, waiting in the lobby
[15:34:28] <snover> hurry up and keep waiting!
[15:36:29] <doug__> safinn: do you have duplicate ids in the html?
[15:38:10] <safinn> doug__ I dont think so. The only element with an ID is the container.
[15:38:43] <safinn> I create div elements in the javascript and add a class and then append them to the container
[15:38:53] <doug__> ok, so you don't have multiple #comment_toggle and expect them all to work
[15:39:36] <doug__> comment-toggle*
[15:41:05] <safinn> sorry what do you mean comment-toggle?
[15:42:35] <doug__> see the element with id="comment-toggle"... is there always zero or one of them on the whole page?
[15:43:43] <doug__> why do you expect to get that 2nd parameter to the click handler? why not var element = $(e.target)
[15:44:11] <safinn> I do not see an element with comment-toggle and I do not expect to have one.
[15:44:25] <skinux> doug__ Sounds like my code
[15:44:29] <doug__> at line 1 char 1
[15:44:30] <doug__> <a id="comment-toggle" data-toggle="collapse"
[15:45:21] <doug__> oh sorry!
[15:45:25] <doug__> have wrong guy
[15:45:28] <skinux> lol
[15:45:38] <doug__> I hate it when I do that lol
[15:45:38] <safinn> You had me scared for a min haha.
[15:46:10] <doug__> skinux: why do you expect that 2nd "element" parameter to the click handler?
[15:46:44] <skinux> I thought e was passed internally and 2nd element is the element that has been clicked
[15:47:11] <doug__> not that I know of... you can remove that element parameter and on the next line do var element = $(e.target)
[15:47:15] <doug__> it will be the one that was clicked
[15:47:53] <skinux> Well, what I'm trying to do is make a div visible using a link
[15:47:53] <doug__> practically every example in the docs has function()
[15:48:04] <doug__> I can't find anything that proves you right or wrong conclusively
[15:48:15] <doug__> I'd have to check jquery source I guess
[15:49:09] <doug__> also, if the click handler shows it, it must have been invisible, otherwise show has no effect
[15:49:16] <doug__> and if it is invisible you cant click it
[15:49:34] <skinux> The link is visible, the div I want it to show is hidden
[15:49:39] <doug__> not invisible. I should say hidden
[15:50:05] <doug__> ok so a descendent's div needs to .show when you .click some ancestor of the div?
[15:50:45] <skinux> No, click link and another div needs to be visible. Not ancestor, child, or parent
[15:50:53] <doug__> skinux: what element do you think "element" is referring to?
[15:51:24] <skinux> element will actually be referring to the div that needs to be shown
[15:51:30] <doug__> the <a>
[15:51:47] <doug__> so you .show() the <a> which is already visible. noop
[15:52:00] <skinux> No, .show() the other div
[15:52:18] <doug__> by reading your mind? what code says "the other div"
[15:52:47] <doug__> e.show()   <--- show the <a>
[15:53:00] <doug__> sorry, element.show()
[15:53:39] <skinux> If you look at the Gist, line 4 of newsfeed.html has the div element that the link needs to make visible https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/5ec945f17cca12c1f2ca4978051b5e7b
[15:53:55] <doug__> yes, and what element do you call .show on?
[15:54:28] <doug__> hint: not the div
[15:54:52] <doug__> wait though. you click the <a> right?
[15:55:18] <skinux> The 'element' that element represents is THAT div.
[15:55:29] <doug__> no, you wish it were, but it is not?
[15:55:32] <doug__> why would it be?
[15:55:34] <skinux> At least, that's what I'm trying to do
[15:55:40] <doug__> \did it read your mind and detect that the div is what you want?
[15:55:49] <skinux> Because that is what is PASSED
[15:55:49] <doug__> you TOLD IT to .show the <a>
[15:55:58] <doug__> right?
[15:56:02] <doug__> you click the <a> right?
[15:56:16] <skinux> No you shoot at it. Yes you click it
[15:56:50] <doug__> it can't read your mind and translate "show the <a> element" into "show some div magically"
[15:57:11] <doug__> you need to .find the div and .show that
[15:57:14] <skinux> Just as I can't read your mind to know what I'm doing wrong.
[15:57:29] <doug__> $(e.target).find('.that-div-selector').show()
[15:57:48] <doug__> or, $('.that-div-selector', e.target).show()
[15:57:56] <robertmaxrees> go witht he first one though.
[15:58:51] <skinux> The link needs to pass the appropriate div (post ID specifically) to the click handler
[15:59:09] <doug__> can you add data-postid="123" to the <a>
[15:59:33] <doug__> if so, you can do var element = $(e.target), postId = element.attr('data-postid'); ...
[15:59:42] <robertmaxrees> don't use attr() for data attributes.
[15:59:44] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[15:59:55] <doug__> I disagree
[16:00:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:00:05] <robertmaxrees> good for you?
[16:00:19] <doug__> .data is NOT for storing strings, noob
[16:00:21] <robertmaxrees> nicer api, safer when handling old browsers, easier to use imo.
[16:00:25] <skinux> Okay, I've added that
[16:00:28] <robertmaxrees> it's for storing literally anything.
[16:00:36] <robertmaxrees> any data associated with an element.
[16:00:54] <doug__> it is so when elements are removed, it releases the reference to it, so .remove() can clean up references to plugins
[16:01:05] <robertmaxrees> and for data attribures.
[16:01:32] <doug__> if you want massive confusion when .data returns one thing and element debugger shows another
[16:01:51] <doug__> I used to advocate .data everywhere
[16:02:08] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:02:11] <doug__> so for string attributes I use .attr
[16:02:19] * skinux doesn't know who to listen to now
[16:02:19] <doug__> you think you are right and I think I am right
[16:02:27] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[16:02:29] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:02:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a solid API and makes sense.
[16:02:36] <robertmaxrees> verify using the console.
[16:02:38] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[16:02:39] <doug__> read the attribute, use attr
[16:02:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:02:46] <robertmaxrees> use the data api :)
[16:02:46] <doug__> yep
[16:02:57] <robertmaxrees> it's much safer overall.
[16:02:58] <robertmaxrees> and cleaner.
[16:03:01] <doug__> this shit is why I don't come here
[16:03:10] <robertmaxrees> because you're as argumentative as anybody else?
[16:03:17] <doug__> 2 or 3 fucking narcisists hang out here
[16:03:21] <robertmaxrees> wowzer.
[16:03:26] <robertmaxrees> then don't come :)
[16:03:30] <doug__> I dont\
[16:03:47] <robertmaxrees> you're expecting people to automatically bow down to your wisdom and then complaining when you're met with the exact same kind of attitude :)
[16:03:54] <robertmaxrees> if you have a problem, feel free to PM me about it :)
[16:04:09] <doug__> yesterday I came and was told that jqXHR doesn't have any methods from Deferred
[16:04:18] <robertmaxrees> weird.  wonder why.
[16:04:28] <skinux> e.preventDefault is not a function
[16:05:18] <Uhkis> wow, is robertmaxrees a narcisist?!
[16:05:29] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[16:05:35] * skinux smacks all of you
[16:05:38] <skinux> Quit bickering
[16:05:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm not bickering ;)
[16:05:51] <skinux> lol
[16:06:03] * Uhkis is having fun with doug__'s expense
[16:06:05] <doug__> you argued with my perfectly legitimate advice to call .attr
[16:06:07] <doug__> which WORKS
[16:06:11] <robertmaxrees> and is a bad idea.
[16:06:17] <doug__> says you
[16:06:22] <robertmaxrees> and the library.
[16:06:24] <doug__> .data is a bad idea when it is not an object
[16:06:30] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[16:06:35] <doug__> makes debugging unnecessarily difficult
[16:06:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a great idea.  you get a neat caching layer with it.
[16:06:48] <robertmaxrees> i disagree. this is why we have debuggers and the console :)
[16:07:02] <robertmaxrees> plus you get a whole slew of benefits.
[16:07:13] <doug__> .attr can't be wrong if you don't use .data for attributes
[16:07:24] <robertmaxrees> so then always use .data() for data attributes :)
[16:07:26] <doug__> that is my entire reasoning
[16:07:28] <robertmaxrees> boom.  problem solved.
[16:07:31] <doug__> .data has benefits too
[16:07:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.  so use it always when handling data attributes.
[16:07:57] <skinux> I've updated the Gist to what I have now https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/5ec945f17cca12c1f2ca4978051b5e7b
[16:08:24] <skinux> The code still isn't doing what I need it to do, and it says e.preventDefault() function doesn't exist
[16:09:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual error you're getting in the console?
[16:09:42] <skinux> Wish Komodo Editor would show function menus for things
[16:09:54] <skinux> Uncaught TypeError: e.preventDefault is not a functionwriteComment @ home:22onclick @ VM12398 home:166
[16:10:58] <Uhkis> *cough* jsfiddle *cough*
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:11:25] <robertmaxrees> also, looks like there's a mysterious other function being referenced here.
[16:11:47] <skinux> yeah, I took out the onCLick...but it's still not showing the div
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> so then you're not still getting the console error?
[16:12:16] <robertmaxrees> make a quick jsfiddle then :)
[16:12:22] <skinux> Not about preventDefault nope
[16:12:28] <skinux> okay
[16:13:17] <doug__> so, that <a> is the ancestor of one post?
[16:13:26] <doug__> or are multiple posts eventually in there?
[16:13:50] <robertmaxrees> that a is an ancestor of a textnode in that gist
[16:13:54] <robertmaxrees> comments are a sibling ;)
[16:14:08] <doug__> you want one button to be tied to one div, by post id? and you want to find which post the <a> is for, then go show that one?
[16:14:50] <robertmaxrees>  data-post-id="14" - passed to $(postId) is going to be $(14) in this case.
[16:15:04] <robertmaxrees> i think you mean $('#post-comment-' + postId)'
[16:15:25] <doug__> ids :(
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> or change postId to something like postId = '#post-comment-' + element.data('post-id');
[16:15:44] <doug__> concatenating string fragments into an id is a bad idea
[16:16:06] <doug__> usually
[16:16:48] <robertmaxrees> if there's a 1:1 relationship between the anchor and the div, you could restructure your markup and rely on that, instead.
[16:16:49] <doug__> why not use a class name and select by attribute? like $('.post-comment[data-post-id="' + postId + ']')
[16:16:51] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to do this.
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[16:17:03] <doug__> not "fast" eh?
[16:17:05] <doug__> get a grip
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> hard to read.
[16:17:21] <robertmaxrees> don't select on attributes.  use .filter() if you really have to do something like that.
[16:17:45] <doug__> I almost said .filter but it would obscure what I was trying to say
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> nah, it wouldn't.
[16:17:58] <robertmaxrees> it'd make much more sense.  generally safer bet, too.
[16:18:13] <doug__> yeah, unless you escape the selector
[16:18:17] <robertmaxrees> plus it introduces a really awesome, undertilized feature of the library.
[16:18:20] <doug__> but thats a PITA
[16:18:30] <doug__> .filter?
[16:18:31] <robertmaxrees> "safer" as in "generally easier and quicker to grok"
[16:18:39] <robertmaxrees> filter with a function.
[16:18:50] <robertmaxrees> like a swiss army knife.
[16:18:51] <doug__> you could make a helper that returns a function for filter
[16:19:08] <doug__> $(sel).filter(postIdEquals(postId))
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> sure?  or you could just use it for now and not confuse the poor dude too much :)
[16:19:44] <robertmaxrees> if he's having trouble with basic selectors, covering concepts like partial application and currying will probably confuse him even more.
[16:19:46] <doug__> function postIdEquals(id) { return function() { return $(this).attr('data-post-id') === id; }; }
[16:20:01] <doug__> yeah, sorry
[16:20:04] <doug__> you're probably right
[16:20:23] <robertmaxrees> could you tell my wife that?
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:20:24] <taplar> attr('data-...') :(
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:20:30] <doug__> lol
[16:20:33] <robertmaxrees> we already had this discussion, taplar
[16:20:36] <taplar> k
[16:20:38] <taplar> lol
[16:20:40] <robertmaxrees> you see, we're all narcissists because we argue for .data()
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> we should just take him at his word.  ours isn't good enough.
[16:20:56] <doug__> aw, sorry for getting mad earlier
[16:21:03] <doug__> robert is usually a good guy
[16:21:07] <robertmaxrees> i don't really care tbh.  i just think it's funny.
[16:23:20] <skinux> The display area needs to be as wide as possible to get the layout/view that I'm trying to fix https://jsfiddle.net/skinux/roq53299/
[16:23:24] <doug__> why not .attr? too slow? lol
[16:23:36] <doug__> got some of your entourage with you now eh?
[16:23:45] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[16:23:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:23:48] <taplar> data() caches
[16:23:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:23:55] <robertmaxrees> also much safer for older browsers.
[16:23:57] <robertmaxrees> skinux uh
[16:23:57] <doug__> ever used a profiler?
[16:23:59] <taplar> and that's it's whole purpose
[16:24:09] <doug__> I have never seen getAttribute
[16:24:11] <robertmaxrees> skinux where's your js?
[16:24:16] <robertmaxrees> also, why are you including the entire page?
[16:26:26] <taplar> data() also lets you store thing that are not strings
[16:26:49] <robertmaxrees> he's arguing you should use data in those cases.
[16:26:52] <robertmaxrees> but it's too confusing otherwise.
[16:27:03] <taplar> hokay
[16:27:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:27:32] <taplar> i mean, it made it into the core, so... obviously its pointless
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:28:56] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:29:20] <skinux> Sorry, forgot to include the js https://jsfiddle.net/skinux/roq53299/1/
[16:31:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/roq53299/2/ what's the prob?  i backed it down from jquery 3 to 2
[16:35:26] <skinux> Comment link should make Comment div show, but it doesn't.
[16:35:43] <taplar> does for me in that /2
[16:35:47] <taplar> ?
[16:36:35] <skinux> What did you change other than the verson?
[16:37:07] <taplar> took out the jquery from the external resources and made it load on body rather than on load
[16:38:04] <skinux> What do you mean yo umade it load on body?
[16:38:27] <taplar> click the JAVASCRIPT <cog icon> in the top right corner of the javascript iframe
[16:39:04] <taplar> you want your scripts to load last, so at the end of the body
[16:39:08] <taplar> *typically
[16:42:57] <skinux> Ahh.
[16:43:14] <skinux> It's working now
[16:48:09] <robertBusy> unf unf unf
[16:48:21] <taplar> ?
[16:49:11] <robertBusy> bored.
[16:49:21] <taplar> lol
[16:50:00] <robertBusy> coaching another dev through a problem right now on our patio.
[16:50:04] <robertBusy> it's a nice day today.
[16:50:08] <taplar> nice
[16:53:12] <taplar> i thought it was funny.  i started copying some of the style of that one website you pointed me to the other day.  shared it out, with a clear message that it was in heavy alpha stage.  still gone one response of 'it don't work' lol
[17:04:23] <VX> in this example, why does form2 submit when you go in a field and press enter but form1 does not ? https://jsfiddle.net/18saffdt/2/
[18:03:12] <T4nk5bb0t> howdy
[18:03:17] <s5fs> hi
[18:03:19] <T4nk5bb0t> Does $. refer to a global namespace?
[18:04:07] <T4nk5bb0t> I am working with signalr and I created a hub connection by saying:    var connection = $.hubconnection();
[18:04:35] <T4nk5bb0t> I always though $ said get the element following $('element') but since I am not including an element name, how does this work?
[18:04:48] <T4nk5bb0t> Is it saying, "go find something with a hubconnection method."?
[18:07:44] <shoky> T4nk5bb0t: $ (which is an alias for `jQuery`) is both an object that indeed acts as a global namespace,  and also it's a function you can call to query the DOM.  there's no connection between the 2 roles
[18:08:15] <T4nk5bb0t> So here, it is acting as a global namespace?
[18:08:17] <shoky> so  $.something  means "the `something` property of the $ object`
[18:08:18] <shoky> "
[18:08:21] <shoky> yes
[18:08:27] <T4nk5bb0t> shoky, Great, thanks! I was just curious.
[18:08:36] <shoky> shure
[18:10:12] <shoky> T4nk5bb0t: and it's good to know that in JS , every function is actually also an object. so jquery uses that fact
[18:10:54] <T4nk5bb0t> shoky, and it is completely dynamic
[18:11:03] <T4nk5bb0t> shoky, you can move functions, properties, etc from object to object
[18:11:13] <shoky> well, as all objects are, sure
[18:11:24] <T4nk5bb0t> shoky, You could say I am almost an expert. I have spent a few days on javascript work.
[18:11:28] <T4nk5bb0t> :D
[18:11:53] <shoky> it's a good title.  "almost an expert"
[18:12:04] <T4nk5bb0t> Yep
[18:12:41] <T4nk5bb0t> I will be there until I hit hour 1000. Then I will realize I know nothing. Then, when I hit hour 10000, I will have no hair on my head, back hair, and look exhausted all of the time.
[18:12:43] <T4nk5bb0t> Can't wait!
[18:13:18] <shoky> i think by the time you have no hair at all you're by definition an expert
[18:13:26] <T4nk5bb0t> lol
[18:13:30] <T4nk5bb0t> *like*
[18:13:38] <s5fs> damn you just described me :(
[18:13:44] <shoky> ;[
[18:13:44] <s5fs> and i'm by no means an expert
[18:13:56] <T4nk5bb0t> s5fs, Nope, sorry, you are an expert
[18:14:03] <shoky> ^
[18:14:13] <s5fs> "baldness expert"
[18:14:22] <T4nk5bb0t> you need to change your resume s5fs and look soley for jobs with the title of "Expert"   Now more "almost an expert" positions for you!
[18:14:26] <T4nk5bb0t> no more*

[18:17:49] <T4nk5bb0t> He, almofost, looks normal sized here. Hard with no reference human.
[18:19:18] <jancoow> Hi there. I've a jquery object from a event (event.target). In this target there are several items with a specific class name. How can i get these and loop though them?
[18:22:45] <T4nk5bb0t> jancoow, Do you mean you want to loop over the dom and read in elements with a specified class name?
[18:24:31] <T4nk5bb0t> if that is the case, then I think something like   $('.className').each(function () {  ... Do your work here });  Here is a link from the jquery api.  https://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:24:32] <jancoow> T4nk5bb0t: no. Lets say i've a <div class="test"><div class="test2"><div class="test2"></div></div> </div> . I want to loop over all "test2" INSIDE "test"
[18:25:22] <jancoow> maybe find then?
[18:26:32] <T4nk5bb0t> jancoow, I am very new to javascript. I dev in .net and I am moving to web somewhat, so take this with a grain of salt. I would think that you could some how specify test.div in some way. I think what I pasted is correct, you just need to figure out how to address elements of type div within class test
[18:27:43] <shoky> jancoow:  yes .find might be what you need
[18:28:07] <shoky> .find(".test2")
[18:29:02] <T4nk5bb0t> shoky, Would you say (or could you)  $.find(".test2") ?
[18:29:22] <shoky> you need to run it on a jquery object
[18:29:38] <shoky> e.g.  $(this).find(".test2")   inside an event handler
[18:29:43] <T4nk5bb0t> ah
[18:29:48] <T4nk5bb0t> this would get the entire page, right?
[18:29:56] <T4nk5bb0t> and then say find .test2 on that page
[18:30:04] <shoky> no, only inside whatever element `this` points to
[18:30:23] <T4nk5bb0t> How do we know what element this points to?
[18:30:48] <shoky> inside jquery event handlers, it points to the element you attached the handler to
[18:30:59] <T4nk5bb0t> ok
[18:31:06] <shoky> e.g. the clicked element, for a click event
[18:31:20] <T4nk5bb0t> everything is so foggy/cloudy in my head right now. It will probably take a week or two until it clears up and really starts to make sense.
[18:31:30] <T4nk5bb0t> Thanks for the explanation
[18:36:35] <jancoow> hehe
[18:36:44] <jancoow> let's check if it works
[18:39:40] <jancoow> yay works
[18:39:42] <jancoow> thanks shoky
[18:45:41] <s5fs> shoky: you're a real hero in here, thx for being an awesome community member
[18:49:13] <samsagaz> hey guys, is possible that jquery (using jqxwidgets) dont works great under firefox? i have an combobox that wont works under firefox and under chrome yes
[18:52:03] <multiform> how do you simulate clicking a button?
[18:52:16] <multiform> $("#AttachFile").click() isn't working
[18:52:19] <taplar> you can do trigger('click')
[18:53:18] <jancoow> only have one problem left, i do a .each() in a click handler
[18:53:28] <jancoow> and now i'm having problems with the "this"
[18:53:47] <taplar> the 'this' in the handler is most likely not a jQuery object.  try wrapping it
[18:54:32] <multiform> taplar:  thanks!
[18:54:38] <multiform> taplar++
[18:54:38] <taplar> np
[18:55:33] <jancoow> mm well
[18:55:41] <jancoow> i want to loop though that find
[18:55:49] <jancoow> with a each(function(){})
[18:56:01] <taplar> you can do that, sure.  so what is the issue
[18:56:45] <jancoow> yeah indeed, but when i try to acces that current object i get problems, because $(this).attr("test") (with a data-test="" attribute in the html) is undefined
[18:57:10] <taplar> right, cause your using attr
[18:57:22] <taplar> only data() does the 'data-' prefix for you
[18:57:33] <taplar> attr you have to match exactly
[18:58:10] <jancoow> omg.. Am i so stupid?
[18:58:14] <jancoow> yes i am.
[18:58:25] <jancoow> I littarly did it right (with data-) 1 rule above it
[18:58:38] <jancoow> i need to get some sleep lols
[18:58:46] <taplar> actually its probably more accurate to say that data() doesn't have to care about the prefix as it's going to mess with the dataset property
[18:59:30] <jancoow> for some reason data() isn't working
[18:59:38] <jancoow> the last time i checked it
[18:59:51] <taplar> what are you trying?
[18:59:55] <jancoow> oh wel nvm
[18:59:59] <jancoow> data is working fine
[19:20:55] <jancoow> $("#extracontrol_" + counter).bind("click", curelement.click); any idea why this isn't working? Wanna forward 1 click handler to another. Uncaught TypeError: this.on is not a function
[19:21:16] <jancoow> curelement.click() is working
[19:21:24] <robertmaxrees> what's the body of  curelement.click) ?
[19:21:46] <jancoow> what do you exactly mean?
[19:21:51] <jancoow> what's inside the other click handler?
[19:21:54] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[19:21:56] <taplar> why not just bind the same handler to both things?
[19:21:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:22:04] <robertmaxrees> that's where i was getting at.
[19:22:14] <robertmaxrees> ahaaah you're trying to run the click method itself.
[19:22:21] <jancoow> that's what i'm trying to do taplar
[19:22:22] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaaaaaah.  i get it.  just bind the listener itself.
[19:22:23] <jancoow> dynamicly
[19:22:32] <robertmaxrees> right but curelement.click isn't the handler.
[19:22:35] <robertmaxrees> that's triggering the click.
[19:23:09] <jancoow> how can i actually bind the same handler?
[19:23:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you're doing something like curelement.click(function() {});
[19:23:29] <robertmaxrees> right?
[19:23:47] <jancoow> it's in the html dom
[19:23:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:24:00] <taplar> onclick attribute?
[19:24:03] <jancoow> ^
[19:24:06] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[19:24:16] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :)
[19:24:22] <robertmaxrees> use jquery for all your event bindings instead.
[19:24:28] <jancoow> I know
[19:24:31] <jancoow> but
[19:24:41] <jancoow> hard to explain ;p
[19:24:53] <robertmaxrees> let me guess: that code wouldn't work otherwise?
[19:25:00] <robertmaxrees> so you have to put it on the element in an onclick?
[19:25:02] <jancoow> the code would have worked fine
[19:25:26] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you really want to use jquery for your event bindings.  it'll make fixing this MUCH easier :)
[19:25:38] <taplar> or at the least addEventListener
[19:25:45] <taplar> just not inline
[19:26:21] <jancoow> imagine i've 100 widgets which can individually implement his viewing (html) and javascript differently. Some are using onclick, some are using event bindings
[19:26:45] <robertmaxrees> they should all be using bindings :)  a single delegated listener would be perfect here.
[19:26:49] <jancoow> does it really matter if it's in the onclick or not?
[19:27:11] <jancoow> because i though forwarding the click() function would be easy ;p
[19:27:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to be depending on tthe code inside of it,
[19:28:40] <jancoow> mhm?
[19:28:52] <robertmaxrees> the error above is proof as to why :)
[19:29:48] <jancoow> i just don't get it ;p
[19:30:06] <jancoow> because
[19:30:40] <robertmaxrees> so the error itself means that it can't find the "on" method, likely because the way the body of the onclick is written assumes that 'this' is a jquery object.
[19:30:53] <robertmaxrees> but when you trigger click, that context isn't getting passed correctly for some reason.
[19:31:10] <jancoow> $("#extracontrol_" + counter).click(function(){ 		curelement.click();		}); this is working but i'm getting in trouble with other problems now ;p
[19:31:28] <jancoow> so i though the other method would be better
[19:31:42] <robertmaxrees> using jquery for your event bindings would bre your best bet here.
[19:32:21] <jancoow> with the last piece of code i've a memory problem, i'm adding these click functions dynamicly and this eventually points to the same object
[19:32:27] <jancoow> because the curelement is overwrited
[19:34:33] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, what is your suggetion for the best way to submit this big blog of data i have now?
[19:34:49] <robertmaxrees> jancoow that why you use a single delegated listener instead.
[19:35:13] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain not sure what you mean.  unless you use ajax, you only have one choice :)
[19:35:35] <jancoow> robertmaxrees: huhw?
[19:35:50] <jancoow> yeah right, a delegate
[19:35:54] <jancoow> but that's somehow not working ;p
[19:36:02] <robertmaxrees> jancoow so instead of binding directly to each element, you use a technique called event delegation where you bind a single listener to a parent element instead.
[19:36:47] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, well... i guess im going to loop through all the input[type='text'] objects within the form (since thats all they will be), and manually create a json object that will be submitted through the post using jquery
[19:36:53] <jancoow> more a function pointer in my eyes ^^
[19:36:54] <AcidRain> it just looks.... rather difficult
[19:37:24] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain so you don't submit posts via jquery unless you use ajax.
[19:37:34] <robertmaxrees> jancoow not sure whgat you mean.
[19:37:36] <AcidRain> oh ok :P
[19:38:05] <AcidRain> luckily, i have successfully done this. (at least the creation of the json object)
[19:38:10] <AcidRain> and its looking good
[19:38:23] <robertmaxrees> jancoow i think you're confused about what event delegation is.
[19:38:40] <robertmaxrees> check out https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[19:40:16] <jancoow> robertmaxrees: yeah i get what you mean :)
[19:42:10] <robertmaxrees> jancoow alright, because that really doesn't have anything to do with function pointers.
[19:44:59] <jancoow> robertmaxrees: well deligate is almost the same as a function pointer
[19:45:05] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[19:45:17] <robertmaxrees> at least, not with the mechanism by which they work.
[19:45:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:45:31] <jancoow> well, long time ago when i programmed some c#.... ;p
[19:45:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not really applicable here.
[19:45:44] <jancoow> as i can remember it only validate the memory where it's pointing to
[19:45:54] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with event delegation.
[19:46:16] <jancoow> i was not talking about the event delegation, just a delegate in general
[19:46:35] <robertmaxrees> right, i was talking about event delegation.
[19:46:40] <jancoow> ;p
[19:46:59] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:48:09] <jancoow> anyways fixed now
[19:48:13] <jancoow> it works
[19:48:13] <robertmaxrees> erm, okay.
[19:48:15] <jancoow> ;p
[19:48:26] <jancoow> thanks for your help and explentation robertmaxrees
[20:03:40] <jancoow> gn
[20:21:08] <aro> whats wrong with this selector? $('#target_metrics div.col-md-2:not(.disabled):last-child')
[21:06:19] <AcidRain> ouch
