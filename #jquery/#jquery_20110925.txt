[00:00:21] <ArchAdmin> LOL
[00:00:21] <snover> thanks alexandroid, you truly are like a human version of google.com
[00:00:25] <ArchAdmin> a separate server?
[00:00:44] <ArchAdmin> zomfg
[00:00:52] <ArchAdmin> and this is GOOD solution?
[00:01:07] <snover> I don’t know what problem you are actually trying to solve
[00:01:26] <ArchAdmin> snover: i am trying to use this js code in my php
[00:01:27] <snover> all I know is that writing a JS interpreter in another, shittier interpreted language is definitely *not* the right way to do it
[00:01:40] <ArchAdmin> running additional server for js is much worse
[00:01:55] <clarkfischer> wow -- im not entirely sure what this code is supposed to do, but I'm pretty sure I don't like it.
[00:02:09] <ArchAdmin> clarkfischer: but it is so cute
[00:02:19] <snover> Hey you guys, I need a bus. I know, I’ll just cut off the top of my VW Beetle and weld some steel on top and it’ll work great
[00:02:43] <ArchAdmin> snover: why do you need a bus?
[00:02:49] <clarkfischer> ...
[00:02:52] <snover> ArchAdmin: why do you need a javascript interpreter?
[00:02:53] <ArchAdmin> i can help, i know a guy selling buses
[00:02:57] <ArchAdmin> snover: to run it
[00:03:05] <snover> you do understand analogies right?
[00:03:08] <ArchAdmin> no
[00:03:18] <snover> oh. well then, nothing I ever say will ever be helpful to you
[00:03:20] <ArchAdmin> please explain
[00:03:35] <snover> nah it’s cool, u trollin bro
[00:04:02] <Spadeski> sup sup how is everyone today
[00:04:12] <ArchAdmin> ok, so is it possible to write multireplace() function that will call replace('a','b') until result != source ?
[00:04:22] <ArchAdmin> how will it be for performance?
[00:04:29] <snover> ArchAdmin: I think that thing you said about quitting and being a janitor instead of a web developer was prescient.
[00:04:57] <ArchAdmin> running separate server for js is not a solution
[00:05:04] <ArchAdmin> and i haven't heard any other solutions
[00:05:24] <Spadeski> snover lao
[00:05:26] <clarkfischer> a better question is why do you need a script that turns any text into a jumble of happy faces
[00:05:27] <Spadeski> lao
[00:05:29] <Spadeski> lmao
[00:05:31] <Spadeski> jeez
[00:05:41] <snover> you haven’t actually explained what you are trying to do either so I guess we are both equally useless
[00:06:06] <Spadeski> Hes trying to make it if someone types text to say an input get a certain tetx
[00:06:12] <ArchAdmin> snover: i am trying to use obfuscated js code in php
[00:06:18] <Spadeski> : ) and change it to a icon
[00:06:37] <snover> ArchAdmin: a big negative there, friend.
[00:06:39] <snover> ?xy problem @ ArchAdmin
[00:06:40] <bot-t> ArchAdmin, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[00:06:41] <ArchAdmin> 10:06:11    eboyjr | v8> 'la la la'.replace('a','o','g') // nonstandard
[00:06:46] <ArchAdmin> and here's the solution that worked
[00:06:54] <ArchAdmin> nobody here knew about it?
[00:07:20] <ArchAdmin> maybe you should raise your js experience instead of talking about buses and vw beetles
[00:07:33] <snover> you do know what the word “nonstandard” means. right?
[00:08:20] <snover> silly question, of course you don’t. it means that is not valid JavaScript and only functions in engines that have that proprietary extension.
[00:08:41] <ArchAdmin> i don't care about other engines
[00:08:47] <ArchAdmin> this script will only run in j4p5
[00:08:52] <ArchAdmin> and it works there
[00:08:54] <Spadeski> snover What do you do ?
[00:09:14] <snover> Spadeski: what do you mean?
[00:09:37] <Spadeski> What are your computer specialties
[00:09:41] <Spadeski> if i May ask
[00:09:43] <snover> still not sure what you mean. :)
[00:10:00] <FNTom> Oh I just had my laughs for the day
[00:10:06] <snover> it’s good that one of the things on the j4p5 roadmap is “add support for unicode strings”
[00:10:12] <FNTom> For the record; NodeJS is really nice, but not for everything.
[00:10:25] <snover> that will come in handy for when you need whatever you are trying to do to actually work
[00:10:44] <snover> FNTom: It is more suitable for running JavaScript on a server than PHP :)
[00:11:38] <FNTom> snover; no doubt!
[00:11:52] <FNTom> Database access with it is a bit clunky though, not enjoyable :(
[00:12:21] <austinbv> why is this unescaping the double quotes http://cl.ly/2M3y1F1N3I1b0l3j1s2B
[00:12:37] <snover> and on that note…
[00:13:20] <austinbv> it does not make sense and because javascript is doing that I cannot parse it
[00:13:44] <FNTom> Huh? You provide the quotes so that when you're defining it, it doesn't interpret it as something else
[00:13:54] <FNTom> Once you've provided it, it knows it's not something else
[00:14:24] <FNTom> Basically, that escaping is for input
[00:14:35] <FNTom> It does not store data like that, if it did it wouldn't be able to use it.
[00:14:43] <austinbv> FNTom: but when wrapped in single quotes should make the string interpret literally
[00:14:54] <austinbv> not parse the escapes I thought
[00:15:06] <muzone> sup austinbv
[00:15:48] <Spadeski> snover I mean do you like to get into projects or is there a group where i can get help with them
[00:15:48] <clarkfischer> im not sure thats true in js, austinbv
[00:16:10] <austinbv> well that sucks
[00:16:23] <clarkfischer> I think it's just part of chrome's web inspector's prettyprinting
[00:16:40] <clarkfischer> obviously it's not identifying it as multiple strings
[00:16:58] <austinbv> clarkfischer: that is true but then the json lints but does not parse
[00:17:07] <austinbv> so there is something funky going on with the escapes
[00:17:24] <clarkfischer> JSON.parse(j) throws?
[00:18:35] <clarkfischer> OH
[00:18:36] <clarkfischer> i see
[00:18:39] <clarkfischer> you are nesting json?
[00:19:06] <austinbv> yeah
[00:19:09] <clarkfischer> i think you may need to triple slash it
[00:19:14] <clarkfischer> one for literal \ and one for "
[00:19:18] <clarkfischer> i.e. \\\"
[00:19:39] <austinbv> ok which means I need to override rails to_json… awesome
[00:19:55] <clarkfischer> i think a better question is
[00:20:01] <clarkfischer> isn't there a better way than nesting json within json?
[00:28:13] <austinbv> yeah that's probably the best solution
[00:28:20] <austinbv> this way was just so clean
[00:33:31] <austinbv> clarkfischer: the points nested json is a ruby hash
[00:33:43] <austinbv> which it just doesn't make sense to send down in any other wa
[00:37:25] <HeN> hey, is there any solution for fading transparent pngs on IE ?
[00:42:51] <jquery> how do I quit a function with jquery
[00:43:10] <jquery> I'm in a          $('#aaa').click
[00:43:14] <jquery> and I want to quit it
[00:45:18] <FNTom> return

[01:16:53] <stradade> hi
[01:18:03] <stradade> if a script works correctly with old 1.5 library it will must work with new 1.6.4 ???
[01:18:39] <Twelve-60> stradade: read changelog?
[01:19:36] <slavka`> hey guys... how can i split a string into array by /r/n/r/n
[01:20:46] <stradade> Twelve-60 so may be yes or no it's dipends the change from 1.5 to 1.6 ?????
[01:20:50] <badcat> slavka`: .split(',') for instance
[01:22:57] <Twelve-60> stradade: presumably, i have no idea
[01:23:20] <Twelve-60> last time i updated there were a few changes but nothing major
[01:25:38] <stradade> i found a slideshow that work with 1.5 i put into a site with 1.6 and don't work
[01:46:41] <ryrych> hi
[01:46:45] <mendota> hey, can i return a variable calculated within AJAX out to a global variable?
[01:46:51] <ryrych> where can I find log of this channel?
[01:47:14] <coldhead> ?logs
[01:47:14] <bot-t> Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[01:47:40] <coldhead> mendota: you can't return to a global variable but you can assign one inside the callback
[01:47:58] <coldhead> window.myEvilGlobal = data.somethingFromTheServer;
[01:48:43] <mendota> coldhead: okay. so, "window" is the global space i'm sending the data to?
[01:48:52] <mendota> and myEvilGlobal is the specific variable?
[01:49:10] <coldhead> yes
[01:49:23] <mendota> okay, just checking. i'll go fuss with that and see what comes of it.
[01:49:29] <coldhead> good luck
[01:49:38] <mendota> thanks
[01:50:34] <ryrych> coldhead: thanks
[01:51:01] <coldhead> any particular reason you want to relive the classic chat of yesteryear, ryrych?
[01:51:57] <lazyPower> i like to search the logs now and again for things i know have been answered before
[01:52:08] <lazyPower> so i dont sound like a total noob.. only a partial noob.
[01:53:33] <ryrych> coldhead: I don’t quite get ‘yesteryear’  :)
[01:53:48] <coldhead> "the past"
[01:53:53] <coldhead> "ancient history"
[01:54:08] <coldhead> "back when mommy and daddy still loved each other"
[01:54:11] <coldhead> "the before time:
[01:54:13] <coldhead> etc
[01:54:35] <lazyPower> bahaha
[01:57:29] <muzone> coldhead: http://www.evilmilk.com/pictures/Land_Before_Time.htm
[01:57:48] <muzone> ryrych: oh i got a decent explanation for you
[01:59:14] <coldhead> hahahha that's excellent muzone
[02:00:59] <muzone> ryrych: u ready
[02:01:04] <muzone> ryrych: http://vimeo.com/2990306
[02:02:46] <troubleman> wow
[02:03:02] <troubleman> now i can definitely dig that
[02:03:10] <ryrych> coldhead, muzone: I looked it up but it wasn't there :P
[02:03:38] <ryrych> but good to know ;)
[02:04:39] <ryrych> ok,
[02:05:44] <ryrych> when is ‘start’ in .draggable fired? when you hold mouse without movement or with movement?
[02:07:50] <ryrych> it seems that it is chrome bug, or jQuery’s? http://jsbin.com/iqadep/6
[02:08:06] <ryrych> hold your mouse without movement
[02:08:17] <ryrych> the cursor should change
[02:08:27] <ryrych> it changes in Firefox but not in Chrome
[02:08:41] <coldhead> that's not terribly surprising
[02:08:53] <coldhead> the specs are very grey in those areas
[02:09:08] <coldhead> it's hard to find out what the correct behaviour is
[02:09:25] <coldhead> it's worse when you're looking at dropping things, srsly
[02:10:01] <coldhead> IF you move the mouse then everyone agrees that counts as movement :)
[02:11:03] <ryrych> coldhead: I see. Do you think that showing ‘move’ from the beginning when you can use panning is sensible?
[02:11:39] <ryrych> now, I showed ‘default’ and when mousedown fired, I showed ‘move’
[02:11:56] <ryrych> but users can be confused, can’t they?
[02:11:59] <coldhead> that sounds reasonable
[02:12:33] <coldhead> i am pretty sure not many people would bother just clicking and then not moving the mouse
[02:12:57] <coldhead> it's a grey area! trust your heart!
[02:13:38] <ryrych> that’s right :)
[02:16:31] <ryrych> btw. a few days ago I vised a web site that offers 30 ui widget, almost native clones and charges for them :)
[02:16:55] <ryrych> *visited
[02:17:02] <coldhead> lol
[02:17:17] <coldhead> there is an enterprise edition of jQuery somewhere that you can pay for
[02:17:21] <lazyPower> sounds like wijmo
[02:17:24] <sean`> ryrych, wijimo?
[02:17:30] <ryrych> yeah, wijmo
[02:17:43] <lazyPower> thats a local business too....
[02:17:47] <ryrych> what do you think of it?
[02:17:48] <lazyPower> crazy pittsburghers
[02:18:32] <ryrych> ‘if you know jQuery, you know wijmo’ ;)
[02:18:38] <djQuery> arent they a jquery sponsor? and isnt some of thier stuff free? ie the ones that directly copy like dialog?
[02:18:51] <ryrych> djQuery: yeah, some of them are free
[02:20:33] <djQuery> they did a fair amount of extending of the dialog
[02:21:13] <sean`> fairn't
[02:23:08] <djQuery> wish thier docs were more like jquery
[02:28:52] <sustanirc> exit
[02:28:59] <sustanirc> exit
[02:52:24] <johnywp> any easy plugins to style a file input guys?
[02:54:25] <knifed> http://pastebin.com/r7YEStcd any one on this question is inside pastebin
[02:57:41] <troubleman> johnywp: good question
[02:58:28] <troubleman> johnywp: please let me know what you find out
[03:05:55] <troubleman> ajpiano: do you know if there's a known bug with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/master/ui/jquery.ui.tooltip.js?
[03:08:11] <troubleman> Anybody? jquery.ui.tooltip.js: TypeError: this._bind is not a function (line 43) focusin: "open"
[03:18:08] <Funhouse> Hi guys, can someone tell me how to use this as a function? thank you http://code.google.com/p/wrdese/source/browse/trunk/b/wpcvn/media/js/jquery.timeFormat.js?spec=svn96&r=96
[03:44:30] <Funhouse> anyone?
[04:02:23] <guy> is it possible to bind variable? to detect onChange().
[04:02:48] <dabear> Funhouse: you provide a timetamp to $.timeFormat
[04:02:58] <dabear> guy: ??
[04:03:31] <guy> well, say I have this variable instance.data = {}. I want to have event $(instnace.data).onChange(updateCalendar);
[04:03:51] <guy> I know I can trigger it manually, though, I am curious whether jQuery can detect that.
[04:04:25] <dabear> ?tias @ guy
[04:04:26] <bot-t> guy, Try It And See
[04:04:37] <dabear> and it's change, not onChange
[04:11:14] <razzla> Hi, I've got an AJAX request modifying the .html() contents of a (hidden) div on success/error. The line after the AJAX request, it slideToggle()s the hidden div in with the new text. The problem I'm facing is that it doesn't wait for the text to be changed, but rather slideToggle()s in with the old text, which is replaced with the ajax results AFTER it's already showing.
[04:11:18] <guy> dabear: I did try already, therefore, I am curious whether there is some different bind/ or method to do it, because this way it doens't work.
[04:11:42] <dabear> guy: you can trigger events on plain objects
[04:11:46] <dabear> and you can listen to them
[04:12:02] <dabear> but there is no auto triggering
[04:12:05] <razzla> Any ideas how I can make the slideToggle() action wait for the request to be finished and text to be replaced, before it shows the div?
[04:15:10] <razzla> I've used .delay() for now, but that's not really ideal because I can't be sure the request will take the same amount of time every time
[04:23:28] <razzla> doh! I can just slideToggle() within my success or error function after the text is set :| *kicks self*
[04:52:06] <rgr> hopefully not a totally dumbarse Q, but is it legal to load a js file from a php/html file with a line like '$("#elem").change=(...' *before* #elem is created.
[04:55:37] <RandoMMeR> hi, can you take a look here and get it to work somehow? http://jsfiddle.net/S76WN/3/
[05:07:44] <dabear> RandoMMeR: http://jsfiddle.net/S76WN/4/
[05:10:43] <kontain> Hey guys does anyone know the fix to my problem? http://www.kamranmotors.com/Core/
[05:10:57] <kontain> When you click on the left hand side menu something 'jumps' and does not show the 'filtered' content.
[05:11:03] <dabear> rgr: no, it is not a dumb question, and no it is not possible to do that, unless you use .live
[05:11:29] <kontain> dabear: a little help please
[05:11:35] <rgr> thanks
[05:11:51] <rgr> never demand...
[05:13:03] <kontain> dabear: help? please.
[05:13:51] <RandoMMeR> dabear: can it be done that element has onclick property? cause i have more elements that need to have its class changed onclick
[05:15:26] <rgr> dabear: do you have any hints and tips in general for debugging jquery? In particular whats the first thing oyu look at when you click something and, for example, the .click doesnt seem to do anything. OK, generally wrong ID etc, but I find the chrome inspector/firefox rather poor at indicating potential problems.
[05:16:12] <dabear> RandoMMeR: do NOT use on*-properties
[05:16:51] <dabear> RandoMMeR: add classes to all elements that should have that behavior, then do $("div.yourclass").click(....
[05:17:21] <dabear> rgr: I just use the chrome inspector
[05:17:38] <dabear> and breakpoints
[05:17:50] <RandoMMeR> dabear: thats great solution! :) thanks
[05:17:54] <kontain> dabear: help with my problem?
[05:18:40] <dabear> kontain: you using a plugin? ask the developer
[05:18:52] <kontain> No, not plugin.
[05:20:31] <dabear> kontain: see ?reduce
[05:20:31] <bot-t> kontain, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[05:20:43] <dabear> I am not seeing your problem either
[05:20:43] <wirehack7> f
[05:21:52] <kontain> dabear: hmm
[05:21:59] <kontain> dabear: the 'load-content' loads empty.
[05:24:28] <dabear> kontain: open chrome/firebug console
[05:24:32] <dabear> select that div
[05:24:46] <dabear> right click->break on attribute modification
[05:25:07] <dabear> step up in the call stack till you find the error
[05:27:34] <rgr> you know I never even realised you could step in the inspector...
[05:28:00] <dabear> kontain: it seems for me that data inside contentInsert is an empty string
[05:34:35] <compact> http://www.irchorseracing.net/new/index2.php?page=getting_started <--- any idea when page opens, all tabs are open
[05:37:30] <dabear> compact: yes, I see that. so fix it?
[05:37:53] <dabear> set display:none on all the content_x except the first
[05:38:29] <rgr> I have an element where display is off, whats the best way to fade this in (which also makes it visible of course). show() bring it up fully visible whereas I would like it to appear then fade in. I guess set its opacity then show it and then fade it in?
[05:38:36] <dabear> and addClass("active") to the first anchor, compact
[05:38:56] <compact> ok thanks
[05:39:01] <dabear> compact: you can do that in the html directly btw, dont need to do it in js
[05:39:59] <dabear> rgr: just simply fadeIn?
[05:40:11] <dabear> should make the element visible as well
[05:40:30] <compact> thanks heaps
[05:41:05] <compact> also, making two tabs diff? so if i click on one tab
[05:41:09] <compact> doesnt close tab undernearth
[05:41:56] <dabear> look at the plugins documentation
[05:42:00] <rgr> heh, you are of course correct.
[05:42:03] <dabear> I haven't used it at all
[05:43:43] <Pitel> I have a script, something simple, like `[1, 2, 3].join('-')` and I would like to fetch the script using ajax and get the resulting string. how to do that? I know there is jQuery.getScript(), but I'm not sure if this will give me the resulting string.
[05:46:26] <dabear> Pitel: add your code to a function , like function foobarindahouse(){ return [1,2,3].join("-") ; }
[05:46:49] <dabear> then do a getScript(), then call foobarindahouse() after the script is loaded
[05:47:09] <Pitel> hmm, this migth work. thanks! :)
[05:47:18] <Klevre> I need to change the referrer of every image being retrieved, what's the easiest way to do it?
[05:49:32] <dabear> Klevre: there is no easy way.
[05:49:51] <Klevre> dabear, alright. What's the hard way?
[05:49:52] <dabear> you can do an ajax call to fetch the images though
[05:50:03] <Titosemi> hi guys
[05:50:03] <Klevre> any examples of that?
[05:50:56] <dabear> Klevre: sure. google
[05:50:58] <dabear> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2342430/xmlhttprequest-to-spoof-referer-then-redirect-to-another-page
[05:52:53] <Titosemi> i'm using $("#countries_data").load("URL" +  #countries_data", "", function() {}); but it's creating a #countries_data inside the existing #countries_data. How can i just get the content of that id and place it inside the existing one?
[05:52:55] <dkris> I had a question regarding Wizard Navigation in jQuery Mobile
[05:53:11] <dkris> Can anyone help me out with this?
[05:54:16] <dabear> ?get(url) @ Titosemi
[05:54:17] <bot-t> Titosemi, jQuery.get(url, [data], [callback], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[05:54:18] <dkris> is there a wizard plugin that i can use in form that can work seamlessly with jQuery and jQuery Mobile
[05:55:02] <dabear> Titosemi: then in the callback, do $(data).find("#countries_data") to extract the contents
[05:55:23] <Titosemi> aham
[05:55:29] <Titosemi> ok dabear
[05:55:30] <Titosemi> thanks
[05:56:32] <dkris> I was looking at a plugin in the lines of http://techlaboratory.net/labs/SmartWizard2/index.htm
[05:58:48] <Titosemi> dabear: uhm, it does the same
[05:59:03] <dabear> nope
[05:59:05] <dabear> pebkac
[05:59:14] <dabear> with get, nothing is added to the document
[05:59:21] <dabear> that's up to you
[05:59:45] <Titosemi> you're right
[05:59:56] <Titosemi> but if i make: var content = $(data).find("#countries_data");
[06:00:19] <Titosemi> and $("#countries_data").html(content);
[06:00:31] <Titosemi> i get the same as with .load()
[06:01:09] <Titosemi> ok
[06:01:13] <Titosemi> var content = $(data).find("#countries_data").html(); that works
[06:01:17] <Titosemi> thanks

[06:23:50] <andriyleu> Hi
[06:23:53] <andriyleu> Can some help me?
[06:24:09] <andriyleu> Is there a way to redirect a div with jquery?
[06:24:25] <Cork[home]> redirect?
[06:24:36] <Cork[home]> what are you talking about?
[06:24:38] <andriyleu> no
[06:24:42] <andriyleu> I mean like href in html
[06:24:57] <andriyleu> make a hyperlink with jquery
[06:25:20] <Cork[home]> you can bind click to the element
[06:25:27] <Cork[home]> and do window.location = 'target'
[06:25:37] <Cork[home]> if thats what you mean
[06:25:55] <andriyleu> like this?
[06:25:56] <andriyleu>     $('#masthead').click(function () {         $(window.location).attr('href', 'http://www.google.com');       });
[06:25:57] <Cork[home]> else its posibly best to just use a link
[06:26:03] <Cork[home]> no
[06:26:18] <Cork[home]> window.location = 'http://www.google.com';
[06:26:40] <Cork[home]> window.location isn't a dom element
[06:27:08] <andriyleu> So what should I do?
[06:27:30] <Cork[home]> as i said, either use a a tag instead of the div
[06:27:45] <Cork[home]> or do $('#masthead').click(function () { window.location = 'http://www.google.com'; });
[06:28:10] <Cork[home]> it won't show link information like an a tag will though

[06:52:43] <solsTiCe> hi. If I bind the click event on a div and also for a button on this div: can I exclude the event click on the div to be processed when I click on the button ?
[06:59:41] <rgr> whats the obvious error I cant see in this? $(".listevent").hover(function () {$(this).children(".shareevent:first").fadeIn("slow", function () {alert("!");});}, function (){$(this).children(".shareevent:first").hide();});
[07:00:09] <rgr> trying to fade in the object of class .shareevent when I hover over the parent element.
[07:01:17] <dalgard> you sure hover takes two functions...?
[07:01:27] <BleKohl> http://privatepaste.com/89fbbfc32f Why does this happen?
[07:01:33] <dalgard> oh, right, sorry
[07:01:38] <BleKohl> I thought has() does the same as find().parent()
[07:02:24] <dalgard> rgr it seems fadeIn only animates opacity, not display ...?
[07:02:58] <rgr> wrong
[07:03:11] <rgr> the alert isnt even called. The issue is the selector
[07:03:14] <dalgard> blekohl has does not do the same as find().parent
[07:03:20] <dalgard> has looks for descendants
[07:03:26] <dalgard> not just children
[07:03:58] <BleKohl> >Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .find() method allows us to search through the descendants of these elements in the DOM tree
[07:04:15] <rgr> so does "children"
[07:04:18] <dalgard> rgr I tend to not used advanced selectors but stick to the traversal functions. gives me less trouble
[07:04:32] <rgr> right ..
[07:05:16] <dalgard> blekohl: yes, however if you find a descendant and take its parent, you are not at all guarenteed that the parent is the element from the original collection
[07:05:22] <rgr> the beauty of jquery and css is using the selectors properly imo. jquery will do it better than me trying traversal selectors ;)
[07:05:27] <dalgard> it's an obvious error, you'll figure it out
[07:05:38] <temp01> BleKohl: what exactly is "els"?
[07:05:38] <BleKohl> Besides, package_contents is a direct child of game_area_purchase_game in this case
[07:05:48] <rgr> I havent, hence I asked here with more experienced jqery guys ;)
[07:06:08] <BleKohl> temp01, jQuery object containing elements after find()
[07:06:49] <BleKohl> I can paste the full code if you want
[07:06:53] <dalgard> for me the problem is to get .add() to work according to the docs. it simply won't allow me to add elements to the collection that are not found in the document via a selector.
[07:07:05] <temp01> BleKohl: can you console.log(els) and see what you get
[07:07:24] <BleKohl> [div.game_area_purchase_game, div.game_area_purchase_game, div.game_area_purchase_game, div.game_area_purchase_game]
[07:07:55] <dalgard> BleKohl: anyway, has() and find().parent() is not at all the same, please don't try to force them to be
[07:08:15] <BleKohl> I see the difference now, but in my case they should be the same
[07:08:54] <temp01> BleKohl: weird, what version of jquery are you using?
[07:09:11] <BleKohl> The latest one
[07:09:12] <BleKohl> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[07:10:03] <troubleman> Anybody know what's wrong with the latest jQuery UI Tooltip? Getting this TypeError: this._bind is not a function (line 43) focusin: "open"
[07:16:31] <BleKohl> Anyway, here's the full code http://privatepaste.com/d828fc0577
[07:18:20] <temp01> BleKohl: um, use the callback to run find and has()
[07:22:38] <BleKohl> temp01,  http://privatepaste.com/fa24fcfa4d
[07:25:42] <temp01> hmm that should work
[07:26:47] <enerel> hi
[07:26:55] <enerel> need help
[07:28:38] <BleKohl> What's more confusing is that it works as expected if I actually go to that page
[07:28:57] <BleKohl> http://privatepaste.com/2f991d50b6
[07:33:47] <BleKohl> Should I write this off as a bug in jQuery then?

[09:33:40] <snollux> hello hello, all. So, for some reason I can't get document.title to work.. I'm not calling it at .ready() [is this a problem?] but from inside a function in an AJAX Chat plugin
[09:34:00] <_tim> hey guys, any idea why neither the selectable (items are not selected on click) nor the tab switching works? code @ http://pastebin.com/mwH7vKRr
[09:34:01] <snollux> but it doesn't seem to do anything, not even document.title document.title = "hello world";
[09:36:47] <Canabinoide> i bring a new window from ajax, and then i have to bind for its clicks... but the funcion "clicks_reload" is being run before the show function
[09:37:18] <Canabinoide> it only works if i show with "slow"... or some considerable time...
[09:38:17] <Canabinoide> but I don't want to "show" with animation... i already tried with "setTimeout(1500,clicks_reload())" but it doesn't work either
[09:38:57] <Canabinoide> please, any ideas ?
[09:40:24] <Canabinoide> when i use $("#thediv").show(function() { clicks_reload(); }); it runs ok, but with animation
[09:40:52] <Canabinoide> if i try to take out the animation, it won't work...
[09:44:25] <snollux> ok, I figured out why the title isn't updating, because it's loading the chat page from an iframe and updating the iframed page's title.. D'oh
[09:47:05] <Titosemi> uhm what am i doing wrong ? var content = $(data).find("#wrapper").html();
[09:47:23] <Titosemi> content is empty, but if i output data
[09:47:29] <snollux> is there a way for the "parent page", i.e. the one that loads the other, to
[09:47:29] <Titosemi> #wrapper is there

[09:48:40] <windsurf_> but that doesn't work. how can i make that equate to the <input> inside element?

[10:10:30] <callumacrae> Does .unbind work with .one?
[10:10:38] <dabear> it does

[10:27:13] <amon293> hi everyone!
[10:27:21] <amon293> hi Eviltwin!~
[10:27:28] <Double_Rainbow> amon293: hello
[10:28:03] <amon293> last night Eviltwin help me with a easytabs problem
[10:28:08] <mrgreenfur> I have a quick question on the validate plugin's use of errorPlacement
[10:28:10] <amon293> it was almost solved
[10:28:18] <jajmon> whats up with this? http://jsfiddle.net/B2xv4/
[10:28:35] <mrgreenfur> I'm using it to re-style an existing tool tip. I don't see any way to un-do it, anyone know where that hook is?
[10:28:38] <Eviltwin> amon293: Is it still not solved?
[10:28:46] <amon293> almost :)
[10:29:03] <jajmon> how come each is run before the console.log?
[10:29:12] <jajmon> i dun get it :-(
[10:29:37] <amon293> http://www.ecosta.pt/site.html - go to "what i do" select the button on the left (business development) and see how the tabs react
[10:29:50] <amon293> sorry
[10:29:52] <amon293> right
[10:29:56] <amon293> right button
[10:30:03] <Eviltwin> jajmon: What?
[10:31:07] <amon293> the tabs nested under the button start-up works fine
[10:31:08] <Eviltwin> amon293: Things look to me like they're working fine...
[10:31:12] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[10:31:23] <amon293> but the tabs on the other buttons don't
[10:31:36] <amon293> click on the right button
[10:31:40] <amon293> and then on bdevelop1
[10:31:48] <amon293> no id is called
[10:31:57] <amon293> but it's there and the html is fine
[10:33:05] <amon293> no div id i mean
[10:33:36] <Eviltwin> amon293: Try $('#bdevelopment').easyTabs({defaultContent:1}); instead
[10:33:43] <Eviltwin> As that's why you called the element :P
[10:34:00] <Canabinoide> Titosemi: you want to find a <#countries_data> OR a <div id=countries_data> ?
[10:34:15] <Titosemi> div id
[10:34:57] <_tim> hey guys, any idea why neither the selectable (items are not selected on click) nor the tab switching works? http://jsfiddle.net/3x7kz/
[10:34:58] <Canabinoide> is it in the DOM ? or just in the data variable ?
[10:35:03] <Canabinoide> Titosemi: ...
[10:35:20] <amon293> Eviltwin: i'm so distracted... thanks man... :)
[10:38:04] <Eviltwin> _tim: Can you try to reduce that code to the heart of the problem instead of copying an entire page into a jsFiddle?
[10:38:12] <Titosemi> Canabinoide: it's in both, i want to replace the content of the actual one wth the content of the ajax request
[10:38:18] <Eviltwin> _tim: Also look into console.log instead of using alert
[10:38:21] <Canabinoide> Titosemi: u can only find(theTAG) in the case u can do find("div").each(function() { if ($(this).attr("id") == "countries_data") { your action here; } ...
[10:39:08] <Eviltwin> Titosemi: Why would he do that? Is there more than one element with that id?
[10:39:18] <Eviltwin> Canabinoide*
[10:39:29] <_tim> Eviltwin :/ some1 told me to create a copy of the page.. :P
[10:39:35] <rgr> using jquery animate (triggered by hover) how can I NOT trigger another animate on an element if one is already running?
[10:39:36] <_tim> where do i find console.log?
[10:39:43] <Titosemi> nom the ID's are unique
[10:40:13] <Canabinoide> of course... that was the wrong way..
[10:40:14] <Eviltwin> So $("#countries_data")
[10:40:24] <Eviltwin> _tim: What browser do you use?
[10:40:31] <Canabinoide> but... if its not on the document ?
[10:40:33] <_tim> firefox
[10:40:52] <Eviltwin> Get Firebug
[10:41:16] <Titosemi> it's in both, in the document and in the response
[10:41:43] <_tim> Eviltwin got that
[10:41:54] <_tim> it doesn't show any errors
[10:41:57] <Eviltwin> Okay, open the little console thing
[10:42:05] <Eviltwin> And type alert(document.body)
[10:42:07] <Eviltwin> And press enter
[10:42:18] <Eviltwin> What do you see?
[10:42:26] <_tim> pops up [object.HTMLBodyElement]
[10:42:34] <Eviltwin> Super useful information, right?
[10:42:39] <Eviltwin> Type console.log(document.body)
[10:42:44] <_tim> if you're a javascript junkie probably :)
[10:43:05] <_tim> okay, that types <body> to the console
[10:43:20] <Eviltwin> Try alert({"a":"b","c":"d"})
[10:43:24] <Nachtwind> hi, i have an IMG element with src pointing to a file. now i would love to remove that pictre (removeAttr('src') works) and make it just show some color instead. is there some way to do this? Tried attr('bgcolor, 'ffffff') already but that didnt do..
[10:43:31] <rgr> whats the best way to store  original attributes so I can restore them after a jquery animate()?
[10:43:31] <Eviltwin> vs console.log({"a":"b","c":"d"})
[10:43:43] <jajmon> Eviltwin, i dont understand why each is run before log in http://jsfiddle.net/B2xv4/
[10:43:54] <Eviltwin> jajmon: It's not
[10:44:00] <_tim> ok
[10:44:02] <_tim> pretty cool
[10:44:07] <Eviltwin> It's a lot more useful
[10:44:07] <jajmon> it looks like it
[10:44:10] <Eviltwin> And it also doesn't stop the entire page
[10:44:12] <_tim> lesson is, never ever use alert to debug? :D
[10:44:16] <Eviltwin> Yes
[10:44:39] <_tim> ok. lesson learned. how can i effectively trace my problem?
[10:44:58] <Eviltwin> Well here's the problem
[10:45:05] <Eviltwin> You have basically crammed a page into a jsFiddle
[10:45:09] <Eviltwin> One loaded with tons and tons of code
[10:45:21] <Eviltwin> Which means needle in a haystack
[10:45:30] <_tim> yeah.. :D
[10:45:32] <Eviltwin> If tabs are the problem, try to remove as much of the other code as possible
[10:45:41] <Eviltwin> And the unnecssary elements
[10:45:50] <Eviltwin> Replace the content of the tabs with like just "Foo" and "Bar"
[10:45:53] <Eviltwin> Get rid of the clutter
[10:45:56] <JohnnyDavidson> Does jquery have any collision detection stuff/
[10:45:56] <Eviltwin> Isolate the problem
[10:45:59] <Eviltwin> Then ask questions
[10:46:23] <_tim> alright..
[10:46:35] <muzone> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH!!!!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q25nUY3iEE HERBIE HERBIE HERBIE!!

[11:28:06] <Entity_> Having some trouble here. After hiding and then showing a few divs, they appear in different locations..
[11:28:50] <JohnnyDavidson> dabear do you know?
[11:29:01] <booboonathan> and dab ear, .add isn't right...
[11:29:04] <booboonathan> dabear*
[11:29:16] <JohnnyDavidson> I need to know when a key is pressed, but it doesn't recognize certain keys like arrow keys
[11:29:24] <dabear> yeah it is, or you described incorrectly what you wanted to do
[11:29:24] <djQuery> whats up?
[11:29:56] <booboonathan> you using i.e. johnnydavidson?
[11:29:57] <booboonathan> ie*
[11:30:09] <StanAccy> I have a DatePicker as the first thing on a Form.  Is there any way to stop the DatePicker receiving an onFocus event when the form is loaded (and thus popping up the calendar) ?
[11:30:11] <Entity_> Just solved my own problem! Nevermind :D
[11:30:37] <JohnnyDavidson> keydown does detect them, but keypress doesn't, I'll just use that instead
[11:30:41] <booboonathan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/492865/jquery-keypress-event-not-firing JohnnyDavidson
[11:30:59] <djQuery> $('elmselector').keyDown(function(e){  console.log(e.which); });
[11:31:00] <JohnnyDavidson> I got it working
[11:31:16] <booboonathan> and dab ear, I want to be able to choose two or more different classes when selecting a mouseover
[11:31:40] <booboonathan> $('.monthDay').AND.('.otherclass').mouseover(function() {
[11:31:44] <booboonathan> something like that ?
[11:31:50] <HeN> hey, is there any solutiion for fading transparent pngs on IE ?
[11:31:59] <booboonathan> or do you just separate the classes with a space?
[11:32:00] <djQuery> booboonathan: so how would you do it in css?   $('selector1, selector2').hover()
[11:32:18] <djQuery> booboonathan: coma
[11:32:30] <booboonathan> ahhh
[11:32:31] <booboonathan> ofc
[11:32:33] <booboonathan> thanks :)
[11:34:52] <lazyPower> HeN: http://www.pngfix.com
[11:37:47] <HeN> lazyPower: I'll check it, tahsnk
[11:37:49] <HeN> thanks
[11:38:14] <lazyPower> That site just links out to png fix solutions. If you're going for javascript, or a specific instance of an app, liek wordpress or joomla / .net etc.
[11:38:39] <do_> Can anyone help me with a GET request
[11:38:56] <snover> no, nobody.
[11:38:56] <do_> I am desperate
[11:38:59] <snover> ?ask
[11:39:00] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:39:35] <lazyPower> ninja'd
[11:40:07] <do_> How do I post the get code?
[11:41:47] <djQuery> do_: see ?demo
[11:41:48] <bot-t> do_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:42:04] <ciss> seen bobince?
[11:42:05] <Lampoon> Sorry, I haven't seen bobince.
[11:42:30] <do_> I dont have a site
[11:42:35] <ciss> wait a sec ... how many bots does this channel actually have?
[11:42:55] <lazyPower> do_:  then use jsfiddle.net
[11:42:59] <djQuery> a couple
[11:43:09] <djQuery> bot-t: I love you
[11:43:10] <bot-t> no you don't
[11:44:55] <do_> I think I did it http://jsfiddle.net/rQxB4/
[11:46:05] <do_> How do can I get the detailspage to show only the selected informations
[11:46:29] <ciss> ... funny how floppy disks are still used for save icons, even though many people might have never seen one
[11:46:50] <lazyPower> thats a good point...
[11:46:51] <djQuery> ciss: well van u think of a better one
[11:47:26] <lazyPower> its one of those relic conventions... what if we used a superman shield for save?
[11:47:42] <arthor> is three a jquery script that will take CSS3's "border-radius:" and make it cross browser ?
[11:47:56] <lazyPower> arthor: modernizr is your best bet.
[11:48:19] <arthor> checkin it out thanks man
[11:48:34] <realpap> im gonnna check it to!
[11:48:56] <ciss> djQuery: an arrow ponting to a document icon might be a better analogy
[11:49:03] <ciss> pointing
[11:50:06] <do_> What is wrong with this GET request? http://jsfiddle.net/rQxB4/
[11:50:56] <djQuery> ciss: you mean export to word?
[11:52:16] <ciss> djQuery: another option would be to display a hard drive instead of the disk (seen a couple of icons doing that)
[11:52:39] <djQuery> ciss: you mean save localy?
[11:53:06] <djQuery> like the disk 2nd
[11:53:12] <ciss> still the majority of icons uses the image of a storage medium that is almost extinct
[11:53:38] <snover> Man, it is a good thing that every other icon ever created has a direct metaphor to real life, otherwise you might have to have this discussion about every other icon that doesn’t actually reflect real things that exist!
[11:54:47] <ciss> snover: sorry for being offtopic, i only noticed it while looking for a save icon ... :)
[11:54:56] <cryptopsy> no need to be sorry
[11:55:47] <snover> why the fuck am I opped
[11:56:04] <snover> oh right, because of Mr I-wanna-join-and-part-1000-times-per-minute
[11:56:07] <do_> Bueller>
[11:56:23] <snover> ?doesn't work @ do_
[11:56:24] <bot-t> do_, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[11:56:51] <cryptopsy> snover: my recommendation; bot auto-kick
[11:58:29] <do_> It outputs all the districts on the details page and I only want the single student's district
[11:58:41] <do_> The information is in a local xml file
[12:02:18] <do_> Where would I place an each statement?
[12:02:38] <ciss> djQuery: btw, found the answer to your question for an alternative on SO: "Use a picture of Jesus. Because everybody knows that Jesus saves..."
[12:02:59] * djQuery lol
[12:03:04] <FNTom> I would not trust Jesus with gigabytes of data :(
[12:04:14] <do_> BUDDY Jesus from Dogma would make a great icon
[12:06:20] <ciss> for anyone interested in the topic, here are some interesting views and discussions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1019573/save-icon-still-a-floppy-disk
[12:09:55] <mw__> Gd ev, anyone here able to help with simple modal question?
[12:10:27] <Cork[home]> ?ask @ mw__
[12:10:28] <bot-t> mw__, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:11:53] <mw__> Does $(foo).modal() calls simple modal box without any message inside? Why if all ui essential components are on the server it still does not work?
[12:12:15] <mw__> It should be $(foo).dialog ofc
[12:12:58] <mike817> is there a function that grabs the html of an id including it's own?
[12:13:07] <djQuery> mw__: $('#mydiv').html('Warning Will Robinson WARNING!').dialog({modal: true});
[12:13:27] <Cork[home]> mike817: no you need to fiddle a bit to do that
[12:13:33] <mike817> for example <div id="foo"><p id="bar"></p></div>   I want to grab all of that from the #foo
[12:14:03] <dabear> ?outerhtml @ mike817
[12:14:04] <bot-t> mike817, jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
[12:14:20] <mike817> ahh that's what i wanted
[12:14:21] <mike817> thanks!
[12:14:22] <djQuery> mike817: see ?html
[12:14:23] <bot-t> mike817, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:14:44] <djQuery> no that just basicaly give innerhtml
[12:15:33] <mw__> Thank you, will try it. Does I need to hide content on the site for modal box purposes? Or UI will hide it automatically?
[12:15:48] <mw__> Do*
[12:16:06] <djQuery> mw__: dialog will handle it
[12:17:04] <mw__> div specified in $('mydiv') is content right?
[12:23:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there any way to know when a certain key is being holded down?
[12:23:33] <JohnnyDavidson> Right now I'm using keypress to detect when a key is pressed, but is there an opposite of that? When a key gets unpressed?
[12:23:57] <dabear> no, but you have keydown and keyup
[12:24:14] <BleKohl> http://privatepaste.com/7225878e14 < ---- Why would this happen?
[12:24:26] <BleKohl> I thought including :last in the selector was the same as filtering afterwards?
[12:24:38] <JohnnyDavidson> okay I'll try that
[12:24:48] <BleKohl> That's even what the documentation says
[12:26:30] <dabear> BleKohl: nope
[12:26:46] <dabear> BleKohl: $(".numbers:last")
[12:26:50] <dabear> drop the emptyspace
[12:27:06] <BleKohl> Interesting
[12:27:13] <BleKohl> What does it do with the space?
[12:27:32] <dabear> same as $(".numbers *:last")
[12:27:45] <mw__> @djQuery: $('#modalNewOwner').html('Warning Will Robinson WARNING!').dialog({modal:true}) is only changing inner html without showing my modal box, checked jquery event with alert and it works, but still dialog() is not working :(
[12:27:53] <BleKohl> Finds all elements inside the resulting array that are last inside their enclosing elements?
[12:28:28] <dabear> BleKohl: nope, fins all children of the p, then selects the last one
[12:28:38] <BleKohl> Yeah that's what I meant to say
[12:28:52] <dabear> but there is also :last-child
[12:29:27] <nddery> Hey, is it possible to use :contains to match all text between parenthesis (*)
[12:29:27] <BleKohl> Shouldn't $(".numbers :last") be the same as $(".numbers").find(":last") then?
[12:30:14] <dabear> nope
[12:30:29] <dabear> hm
[12:30:32] <dabear> well, maybe
[12:30:40] <nddery> or use it to match any regular expression
[12:31:04] <dabear> not sure if "*" matches all children and sub children, or just immediate children
[12:31:21] <Connor_> Matches everything if it works the same as CSS
[12:32:26] <BleKohl> Why does $(".numbers :last") only return one element?
[12:32:39] <Connor_> You are only selecting the last element
[12:32:43] <BleKohl> Shouldn't it return the last child of both classes found with $(".numbers")
[12:32:50] <snover> no.
[12:32:52] <mike817> because you're grabbing the last element with the class numbers
[12:32:53] <BleKohl> *both elements
[12:32:55] <snover> :last is a proprietary selector.
[12:33:13] <mike817> sounds like you need .each()
[12:33:42] <BleKohl> <snover> :last is a proprietary selector. <-- what does it mean?
[12:33:53] <dabear> it is jquery-only
[12:34:04] <dabear> it is created by the designers of jquery
[12:34:09] <BleKohl> So?
[12:34:10] <Lampoon> So are you
[12:34:20] <dabear> so what?
[12:34:27] <dabear> you asked wht propietary means
[12:34:31] <dabear> thats what it means
[12:34:46] <BleKohl> So what if it's proprietary?
[12:34:47] <snover> ?last-selector @ BleKohl
[12:34:49] <bot-t> BleKohl, :last Selector - Selects the last matched element. http://api.jquery.com/last-selector/
[12:35:05] <BleKohl> I already looked at that
[12:35:09] <dabear> ?last-child @ BleKohl
[12:35:10] <bot-t> BleKohl, :last-child: Selects all elements that are the last child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/last-child-selector/
[12:35:27] <snover> BleKohl: This time, read it instead of looking at it
[12:35:29] <dabear> :last-child might return multiple elements
[12:35:47] <Connor_> last-child is a native CSS selector
[12:35:53] <Connor_> IIRC it will only return one
[12:35:59] <Connor_> As does first-child
[12:36:12] <snover> Connor_: wrong.
[12:37:16] <Connor_> Okay, what did I say wrong?
[12:37:36] <dabear> Connor_: last-child can return multiple elements
[12:37:43] <Connor_> Ah, I see
[12:38:03] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/FXLWU/1/
[12:38:25] <snover> dabear: it is too bad that information is not in the first sentence of the API documentation for :last-child that you linked to a few lines ago, huh. :)
[12:39:08] <dabear> snover: if you figure out what to add, I can do that for ya
[12:39:21] <snover> …
[12:39:22] <snover> woosh.
[12:39:30] <BleKohl> So, does :last select the last child of the last element in the selection then?
[12:39:32] <Titosemi1> is it possible to replace all the page content with a new one and having the thing still working ? (i'm using the .live() event)
[12:40:05] <dabear> BleKohl: :last doesn't know about children, it selects the last element in the collection returned by the epression on the left side
[12:40:39] <delfis> hey
[12:40:41] <delfis> http://paste2.org/p/1671136
[12:40:46] <delfis> why onclick submits form?
[12:40:46] <BleKohl> http://privatepaste.com/7225878e14 <-- look at this
[12:40:54] <delfis> there is also another form in the page
[12:40:56] <delfis> then it submits
[12:41:56] <dabear> BleKohl: I TOLD YOU, your second code has an implied star selector on it
[12:42:06] <dabear> $(".numbers :last") == $(".numbers *:last")
[12:42:37] <dabear> it selects all children og all .numbers, then filters all out of those elements in the collection except the last
[12:43:02] <djQuery> mw__: what are u talking about http://jsbin.com/iqeguq/edit#javascript,html,live
[12:43:03] <dabear> of
[12:44:43] <mw__> <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css" />
[12:44:43] <mw__> <script  type="text/javascript" src="js/own.js"></script>
[12:44:43] <mw__> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[12:44:43] <mw__> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js"></script>
[12:44:49] <BleKohl> What would be an equivalent of that complex expression with two simple expressions?
[12:45:15] <mw__> i was thinking bout css, by mistake pasted code here
[12:46:26] <mw__> css/ui-lightness/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css it's bad
[12:46:28] <mw__> ?
[12:47:03] <BleKohl> http://privatepaste.com/f83b5d9782
[12:47:54] <dabear> BleKohl: you wouldn't mind posting your html as well? But I guess $(".numbers").find(":last")
[12:48:26] <BleKohl> As you can see in my privatepaste, that gives two elements
[12:48:56] <mw__> I think css was the problem, pasted your code solution djQuery and it works, thanks.
[12:49:10] <BleKohl> http://www.steamgifts.com/open/search/half-life Here's the HTML
[12:53:24] <Nachtwind> short question... i have two forms containing the same named and IDed <select> boxes. THe forms have different names. Is it possible to set the SELECTED value of those boxes by using the forms name somehow?
[12:54:08] <dabear> BleKohl: what I think happens there, is that  the result of .numbers is set as the context for the .find to look through
[12:54:35] <dabear> .numbers consist of two elements, so the context will be an array of two elements.
[12:54:38] <discorpia> Nachtwind: you could probably use $('#id')[0] but that is broken html and is to be considered unpredictable at best.
[12:55:05] <dabear> so jquery searches both elemens, and regards them as seperate contexts
[12:55:18] <Nachtwind> puh.. there is no way to do #formid.#boxid.val ?
[12:55:27] <devinrolsen> Hey, I'm trying to grab the first list item after pointing to a specific class list item. I have a condition setup in the chain, but can't for the life of me figure out how to get back to the first list item when this condition is met. Any suggestions? http://pastebin.com/VNRwcsEG
[12:55:29] <discorpia> Nachtwind: if you have two elements with the same id you've breached one of the key points in html id attributes, and there is no behaviour that can be guaranteed from that. different browsers will probably handle that differently
[12:55:36] <discorpia> Nachtwind: fix your forms instead.
[12:56:02] <Nachtwind> ok.. will do that then
[12:56:19] <Nachtwind> thought it was more hirarchical that ids on a deeper level do not matter to be the same
[12:56:25] <BleKohl> So there is no way to convert $(".my-class :last") into two simple expressions?
[12:57:01] <dabear> BleKohl: search for jQuery.find( selector, this[i], ret ); here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.js
[12:57:09] <dabear> and you can verify what I say
[12:57:42] <discorpia> Nachtwind: some/most browsers probably treat it that way, but it's not standards compliant and therefor very unreliable. if you want to get around it and keep your ids (if you can't change it for some reason) then apply classes to them instead and use those for addressing
[12:57:46] <delfis> then it submits
[12:57:48] <delfis> http://paste2.org/p/1671136
[12:57:52] <delfis> why onclick submits form?
[12:57:59] <delfis> there are two forms in page
[12:58:18] <discorpia> Nachtwind: it could even be the same class name, since you could do hierarchical selector for it, i.e. #formid.class
[12:58:28] <dabear> BleKohl: $(".numbers :last")  can be written as $(".numbers *").last()
[13:00:05] <BleKohl> $(".numbers").find("*").filter(":last") does the same thing
[13:00:32] <BleKohl> I guess it makes more sense now
[13:04:24] <djQuery> mw__: course it does
[13:06:23] <cryptopsy> are there benchmarks for page load times for various popular javascript libs?
[13:06:41] <mw__> I made proper dialog pop-up when clicking, but it shows my content which should be hidden, it's hiding ofc when I call proper event. How to hide onload using dialog modalbox content? When I hide it using autoopen:false and then try to call it I have a problem - it's not showing up ;)
[13:08:13] <mw__> Should i use display:none?
[13:09:48] <BleKohl> Then there's another thing I don't understand
[13:09:53] <BleKohl> I'm using ajax in my userscript
[13:09:56] <BleKohl> console.log($(".numbers :last", data));
[13:10:07] <BleKohl> This prints [a /open/se...e/page/2, a /open/se...e/page/2]
[13:11:35] <BleKohl> If I understand correctly, ".numbers :last" finds all elements of class "numbers", makes an array of all its descendants and takes the last one of it, right?
[13:11:45] <BleKohl> *all their
[13:12:16] <mw__> Used open function, sorry for inquiry. Thanks for support, have a good night cheers
[13:13:57] <dabear> BleKohl: nope. $(".numbers :last", data) is the same as $(".numbers *", data).each( function(){  $(this).find(":last")  })
[13:14:39] <BleKohl> Why is it different without the second parameter?
[13:16:43] <BleKohl> Oh, wait a second...
[13:17:54] <BleKohl> When doing it from the console, it gives me what I expect
[13:18:00] <BleKohl> One element, that is
[13:18:18] <BleKohl> >>> $.get("http://www.steamgifts.com/open/search/half-life", success=function(data) { console.log($( ".numbers :last", $(data) ) ); } )
[13:18:22] <BleKohl> [a /open/se...e/page/2]
[13:20:10] <dabear> any reason as to why you assign the callback function to a variable named success btw?
[13:20:52] <BleKohl> Because such is the parameter name for the callback function?
[13:22:13] <dabear> success= can be removed
[13:23:04] <BleKohl> Oh, okay
[13:23:16] <BleKohl> I thought it couldn't because it's the third parameter
[13:23:27] <BleKohl> I'm still new to jQuery
[13:23:46] <BleKohl> Actually, I never used it before today
[13:26:09] <micro__> hello jquery.... i'm trying to change a css property of an element with the pseudo selector :hover  but am unable to do so...
[13:26:18] <micro__> can anyone help? –– http://jsfiddle.net/J3fH6/
[13:26:34] <ciss> i could use some advice on this $.extend() problem: http://jsfiddle.net/GHSUH/
[13:30:11] <tra> micro__: http://jsfiddle.net/J3fH6/4/
[13:30:50] <do_> What is wrong with this GET request? http://jsfiddle.net/rQxB4/
[13:30:51] <micro__> tra: thanks... my goal hover is to set the pseudo selector :hover for an element using jquery
[13:31:15] <do_> It returns all students districts instead of just the chosen students district
[13:33:00] <tra> micro__: you want to make a link look like it has the same styles as in :hover?
[13:33:34] <micro__> tra: you have a good point... i could fake it... however im trying to stay true to stylesheets on the page
[13:33:54] <micro__> tra: is there no way to affect the css style for :hover of an element using jquery?
[13:41:17] <Connor_> @micro__ why can't you do it through the stylesheet?
[13:41:30] <micro__> Connor: you mean with pure js?
[13:41:36] <Connor_> No I mean with just css
[13:41:44] <micro__> how would i do that?
[13:41:46] <Connor_> Like write a selector with .something:hover { }
[13:42:06] <micro__> how would i add to the page?
[13:42:18] <Connor_> You can write CSS right?
[13:42:23] <micro__> at runtime?
[13:42:41] <Connor_> There is no magic about it, its just a style rule you put in your stylesheet
[13:42:46] <Connor_> Like you do with the rest of your elements
[13:42:56] <micro__> how would i put it in a stylesheet is my point?
[13:43:10] <Connor_> As you do with any other styles
[13:43:21] <Connor_> Want to make a div black? div { background: black; }
[13:43:22] <tra> open your stylesheet in the editor of your liking
[13:43:23] <micro__> i would need javascript to do that
[13:43:35] <Connor_> Why would you need jS?
[13:43:48] <micro__> because the css is being edited ar runtime
[13:44:03] <Connor_> is the :hover styles going to always stay the same?
[13:44:10] <Connor_> Or is it changing depending on criteria
[13:44:10] <micro__> no
[13:44:18] <Connor_> Then you don't need to do it in JS
[13:44:18] <micro__> yes its changing
[13:44:21] <Connor_> Oh
[13:44:23] <Connor_> Okay
[13:44:32] <Connor_> Then you can create a <style></style> block and add it in your page
[13:44:38] <Connor_> With the style rules
[13:44:42] <Connor_> Such as div:hover { }
[13:44:45] <Connor_> Otherwise
[13:44:58] <Connor_> Use $('div').hover(function() { $(this).css(); });
[13:45:07] <ciss> micro__: there's a "rules" plugin for jquery that allows to alter css rules during runtime
[13:45:08] <micro__> Connor_ thanks ill try one of those
[13:45:19] <tra> micro__: like in my example ;)
[13:45:20] <micro__> ciss: really?
[13:45:32] <Connor_> If you have more than 15 elements that you are applying the rules to then its faster to create a style block
[13:45:33] <micro__> tra: yup ;)
[13:45:37] <tra> micro__: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[13:45:41] <ciss> really. it's quite old, so you might have to debug a little. i think i used it with 1.4.2
[13:45:43] <Connor_> But if there is less than 15 elements you are applyign them to then doing .css() is faster
[13:46:02] <micro__> Connor_ ah good to know
[13:47:48] <Connor_> For reference, Paul Irish discussed the benefits of creating a style block over .css in this presentation: http://paulirish.com/2009/perf/
[13:51:14] <Caraes_Naur> what could cause .ui-accordion-content to be the wrong height for the accordion container?
[13:51:46] <Caraes_Naur> right now I have {fillspace: true, autoHeight: true }
[13:51:53] <ciss> correction: it wasn't a jquery plugin, but a set of functions: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/482363/
[13:54:12] <BleKohl> Okay, jQuery is freaking me out
[13:54:21] <BleKohl> If I do
[13:54:22] <BleKohl> $.post("http://www.steamgifts.com/ajax_gifts.php", {query: "half-life", view: "open"}, function(d){console.log($(".numbers :last", $(d)));} );
[13:54:29] <BleKohl> Then I get an array of two elements
[13:54:43] <BleKohl> But if I actually go to that page and do
[13:54:55] <BleKohl> $(".numbers :last")
[13:54:59] <BleKohl> I get one element
[13:55:05] <BleKohl> Why is that?
[13:55:47] <Caraes_Naur> because :last
[13:56:11] <BleKohl> What about it?
[13:56:14] <Caraes_Naur> is filtering the match set down to ony the last member
[13:56:26] <ciss> BleKohl: does it return an html page or an html fragment?
[13:56:38] <BleKohl> A fragment
[13:57:01] <micro__> ciss: interesting
[13:57:47] <BleKohl> I know that has() doesn't work when using arbitrary data as context
[13:58:07] <BleKohl> Does :last work differently when using arbitrary data as context?
[13:58:10] <ciss> micro__: saved my ass on an element heavy page (*lots* of spans) with customizable element colors. here's the original link: http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript
[13:58:52] <micro__> ciss: i like that i know whats going on : )
[14:01:20] <BleKohl> Oh, it also works correctly for both ajax and the actual page for the full pages
[14:01:24] <BleKohl> So weird
[14:05:51] <BleKohl> Anyway, there are two elements of class "numbers" and I need to get the last element of either of them
[14:06:00] <BleKohl> What would be the most jQuery-ic way of doing it?
[14:06:19] <BleKohl> Err, the last child of either of them
[14:06:41] <BleKohl> I currently have $(".numbers :last", data).last()
[14:08:00] <BleKohl> I don't like how it has 'last' twice
[14:11:15] <ciss> BleKohl: how does '.numbers > :last' behave?
[14:12:03] <BleKohl> Same as without the >
[14:12:08] <BleKohl> What does it even do?
[14:12:32] <ciss> selecting only direct descendants
[14:12:55] <BleKohl> Well, there are only direct descendants anyway
[14:22:49] <nathggns> Can you guys test my plugin? http://nathggns.github.com/Scrollbars/
[14:23:56] <FNTom> Criticisms? :P
[14:24:50] <nathggns> lolwut FNTom?
[14:25:24] <FNTom> Are you open to criticisms? :P
[14:26:55] <nathggns> Yes
[14:27:15] <FNTom> Okay, first of all the scroll bars are being replaced after the content has finished loading
[14:27:19] <nathggns> as long as its not "why are you doing it, theres so many that all ready exist"
[14:27:29] <FNTom> Resulting in seeing the original scroll bars for a second, before it switches to the new view
[14:27:35] <FNTom> Which is pretty bad visually speaking
[14:28:16] <FNTom> Look into triggering it when the DOM elements have been rendered, not when all external content has finished loading
[14:28:32] <FNTom> If I click & drag text to the edge of the scroll window, it doesn't automatically scroll
[14:29:00] <FNTom> And... The mouse scroll seems a bit slow / unresponsive but I'm guessing that's just a sensitivity setting that can be tweaked :P
[14:29:05] <FNTom> Other than that, works as expected :)
[14:29:10] <nathggns> FNTom, it waits until all child imgs load, because if it doesn't, some dimension calculations will be wrong that it requires
[14:29:28] <nathggns> What event would I bind for the text selection?
[14:30:35] <bencc> is there a jquery function to handle timeout with a scope?
[14:31:31] <wizbit> what are jquery min files used for?
[14:32:15] <nathggns> wizbit, they are files with most whitespace removed to increase load times
[14:32:24] <Woet> someone might want to ban natali
[14:32:27] <wizbit> ohhhhh
[14:32:28] <Woet> on-join spam
[14:32:46] <wizbit> nathggns: so what gets loaded first, min files?
[14:33:04] <wizbit> Woet: i thought i pulled, but it was spam :(
[14:34:42] <wizbit> does white space really reduce load times?
[14:34:47] <nathggns> yes
[14:34:47] <wizbit> *increase
[14:34:49] <nathggns> yes
[14:34:51] <wizbit> jeeze
[14:35:06] <nathggns> FNTom?
[14:35:14] <wizbit> is there a way to convert a standard html document so there is no white space
[14:37:19] <nathggns> yes, but dont'
[14:38:38] <wizbit> nathggns: why not
[14:39:53] <ent0camel> Hi, Im trying to change the text in the div.status (http://pastie.org/2591000) but this one does not work (http://pastie.org/2591003). Any ideas? Thanks.
[14:42:00] <Clorith> I'm on the hunt for a treeviewer, preferably with ajax loading of children. I did find jsTree, but it appears to have been dropped in mid-2010 and is no longer maintained and it has some pretty bothersome quirks that makes it hard ot use
[14:42:26] <Clorith> Does anyone happen ot know any alterantives for it? (I saw there was plans to implement it in jQueryUI, but I've not seen anything other then mentions of it)
[14:48:00] <nathggns> FNTom
[15:07:34] <Bower^> http://pastebin.com/kgTYi7Ja - What changes would I need to make for that to work? I am checking on google but a lot of examples are using "new" and making something seemingly quite simple into something quite convoluted. I just want the comedian object to take on functionality from its parent and implement its own.
[15:08:09] <Bower^> I've seen examples using defineProperty() but seems a bit messy
[15:08:39] <Bower^> I'd appreciate if someone could take a look, it's real simple
[15:12:20] <ciss> how can i check inside a plugin that a provided object is a jquery colletion? "config.elem instanceof jQuery" returns false, even though config.elem is a jquery object
[15:12:31] <ciss> -colletion +collection
[15:14:37] <rmurphey> Bower^: i think Object.create doesn't let you do what you're trying to do
[15:14:53] <rmurphey> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create
[15:15:24] <rmurphey> the second arg to Object.create isn't a mixin like you're expecting
[15:16:31] <Bower^> rmurphey, http://pastebin.com/DfNtWucY
[15:17:04] <rmurphey> yes, that will work in browsers that actually implement Object.create :)
[15:17:17] <Bower^> Yeah I was thinking about that
[15:17:33] <rmurphey> the Object.create polyfill that MDC suggests doesn't accept a second arg tho
[15:17:40] <Bower^> It is a pet project so it's tempting so just say fu to old browsers but I'm not really learning anything of substance then
[15:18:11] <rmurphey> you could write an Object.create polyfill that would look at the value prop, but making it a true polyfill would be harder
[15:20:32] <Bower^> So should I just use the prototype approach that uses "new" :/
[15:20:54] <rmurphey> you could also do http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/Tkz4j/
[15:20:57] <rmurphey> Bower^:
[15:21:09] <chrislabeard> Anyone know of a tutorial on seeing if a select field has a specific value then do something
[15:21:24] <Bower^> rmurphey, that's lovely. God damn I love jQuery
[15:21:45] <Bower^> Thanks a lot man
[15:21:51] <rmurphey> but note that any changes that you make to Person won't propagate
[15:22:27] <Bower^> rmurphey, shouldn't be an issue with my particular project but good to know, thanks
[15:22:31] <rmurphey> Bower^: "new" is useful when you define a prototype
[15:22:40] <rmurphey> then you can create new objects that "inherit" that prototype
[15:23:04] <rmurphey> and if you make changes to the prototype, those changes will be passed along
[15:23:10] <Bower^> Interesting
[15:23:16] <rmurphey> http://alexsexton.com/?p=51
[15:23:42] <Bower^> I'll grab a cup of tea then give it a read, cheers
[15:24:22] <rmurphey> enjoy :)
[15:45:36] <imsky> aw yeah
[16:30:24] <joikus> you guys
[16:30:39] <joikus> I'm looking for the absolutely bestest of the best solution to this problem,
[16:30:46] <joikus> maxlength for <textarea/>  :[
[16:30:48] <coldhead> joikus: use flash
[16:30:51] <joikus> haha
[16:31:10] <joikus> i tried a few jquery solutions, some dont work well with IE, etc etc.. wondering what's the best solution
[16:31:29] <joikus> so textarea behaves like input type="text" maxlength="10"
[16:31:41] <coldhead> the honour system is really the best way
[16:31:50] <joikus> ok
[16:31:54] <joikus> but seriously
[16:31:56] <joikus> what do pros do
[16:32:30] <coldhead> i wouldn't know about that
[16:32:42] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery :D
[16:42:33] <coldhead> joikus: how about something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/YaSnF/2/
[16:43:23] <coldhead> there is an extraneous len variable there
[16:43:25] <coldhead> i am so sorry
[16:54:39] <SvcGhost> Wzup guys. Is there a way I can deeplink to my website on the website of someone I did work for, but without it being visible to them? Would you suggest a hidden element?, or maybe a meta tag?
[16:55:39] <StanAccy> I have a Datepicker on a Form as the first input element.  Is there a way to prevent the calendar from popping up on the initial form display (because the input field receives focus, and thus triggers the calendar to popup).  Id still like the calendar to popup if the user clicks in the input field
[16:55:56] <SvcGhost> on click
[16:55:56] <StanAccy> Either an option/config setting or some custom JS would suffice
[16:56:27] <StanAccy> SvcGhost: That aimed at me?
[16:57:34] <bencc> I'm using 1.6.4 but $.proxy is undefined
[16:58:37] <SvcGhost> StanAccy yes
[16:58:58] <StanAccy> SvcGhost: The "showon" option doesnt have an option for click though - just Focus, Button or Both
[17:01:13] <Haon99> Is it possible to append an opening div tag without the closing tag and vice-versa?
[17:02:00] <coldhead> no Haon99
[17:02:10] <coldhead> if you want to work with fragments of html use strings
[17:03:03] <Haon99> What would the syntax look like?/What am I searching for?
[17:05:05] <Haon99> (I understand this is a bad practice, but I won't turn you in if you help me.)
[17:08:52] <ciss> Haon99: what do you need it for?
[17:11:43] <frankbro> anyone knows a script online that can do csv on autocomplete? That is, do a new query for each word seperated by a comma?
[17:12:44] <danzik17> frankbro: You mean like search a CSV for a given word?
[17:13:11] <frankbro> danzik17, no, but I think I found it, theres an example here : http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote
[17:19:14] <Haon99> ciss: I'm populating divs in a loop. I wanted to make it, loop through and close it off, because I have no need for setting IDs on all of the divs, but I suppose I can and do it properlyu
[17:20:16] <ajpiano> Haon99: this article describes the technique you should use
[17:20:17] <ajpiano> http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[17:20:41] <Haon99> ajpiano: Thanks. I'll check it out

[17:49:28] <Ryan__> hey
[17:56:28] <abjorn> coldhead!
[17:56:29] <Lampoon> coldhead is great
[17:56:43] <abjorn> thanks for that information lampoon
[17:57:28] <coldhead> i have mostly contempt for you, Lampoon
[17:59:30] <abjorn> lololol
[18:00:39] <JohnnyDavidson> Is it possible to make a div or something
[18:00:46] <JohnnyDavidson> and make things only visable inside it
[18:01:15] <JohnnyDavidson> Like if there was a 500px div, and a 600px div inside it, I want the 600px div inside to be cut off and not be visable for the last 100px
[18:01:44] <Ryan__> but you still want the first 500 to show?
[18:01:52] <FNTom> Look up CSS overflow
[18:01:59] <JohnnyDavidson> yes
[18:02:31] <Ryan__> count the height of the inner div
[18:02:45] <Ryan__> and if its greater than 500, 	$('#yourDiv').css({'overflow':'hidden'});
[18:03:08] <Ryan__> (new to jquery and javascript, but that's what i'd do)
[18:03:35] <FNTom> No, just apply css overflow: hidden; no need to do it with Javascript
[18:04:41] <JohnnyDavidson> Doesn't seem to work
[18:06:20] <Ryan__> what happens
[18:06:24] <JohnnyDavidson> http://jsfiddle.net/KtcEP/
[18:06:29] <JohnnyDavidson> Am I doing it right?
[18:07:28] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi
[18:07:32] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I have this code     $("#signinDialog").effect( "pulsate",  {times:3}, 500 );
[18:07:52] <Nicolas_Leonida2> when I run it the effect happens to the contents of the dialog, not the dialog itself
[18:07:59] <Mystiana> Just ask?  Um, okay.  I am using a replaceWith() on a select and when I try and reselect the first value, where I've changed the value, I am getting the old value, but change it again and the new values are correct.  Anyone had this problem?
[18:07:59] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I want the dialog itself to have the effect
[18:08:16] <boopaloop> hey guys. i'm developing a plugin that changes the positioning of selected dom elements, and i need to be able to reset the elements to their original position style and position. is there an easy way to do this with jquery?
[18:08:37] <Ryan__> Johnny, <div style="overflow:hidden;height:500px;width:500px;background-color:#FF0000">
[18:08:40] <Ryan__> for the containing div
[18:10:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Oh got it !
[18:10:01] <JohnnyDavidson> thank you
[18:10:29] <jefflembeck> Does anybody every have trouble with $(window).unload in Chrome?
[18:11:12] <jefflembeck> even, $(window).unload(function(){ alert("hey"); }); doesn't work when I click a link to go to another page
[18:11:44] <Mystiana> http://jsfiddle.net/56PwS/  So basically, I replace a select with new values, and even the alert() I use shows me the old ones until there's another change.
[18:19:38] <boopaloop> does anyone know a good way to manager pushing / popping css values? i'm trying to get my plugin to revert back to the original css when it gets destroyed
[18:23:46] <Ryan__> could you save the values at the beginning?
[18:25:27] <boopaloop> that's what i'm looking at so far, i was hoping there was some way to just undo any css properties i set... i could probably use .cssHooks to keep track of things but that sounds awfully messy
[18:25:43] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a way to round a variable?
[18:25:53] <JohnnyDavidson> Math.floor seems to round down only
[18:26:00] <boopaloop> Math.parseInt
[18:26:20] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, round - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round
[18:28:10] <JohnnyDavidson> thanks
[18:29:20] <StanAccy> Is there any way to tie a Datepicker to an inline image such that when the image is clicked, the Datepicker overlay pops up and the selected date gets set in another <span> ?
[18:31:33] <ajpiano> StanAccy: use the buttonImage, buttonImageOnly option to do the buton part and the onSelect event to use the span part
[18:34:06] <StanAccy> ajpiano: Many thanks
[18:36:10] <Mystiana> huh, even when I just set it with .val(2), I still get 1 first... :/
[18:36:19] * Mystiana is stumped -.-
[18:43:06] <joikus> maxlength for <textarea/> ?
[18:43:23] <Ryan__> new to query > is there a similar tool to jslint for it that works well?
[18:48:27] <realpap> how can i add a class to a <li> element with jquery if there isnt any? i mean .addClass("test") would not work
[18:49:22] <ajpiano> huh
[18:49:24] <holodoc> Why wouldn't it work?
[18:49:29] <realpap> dunno
[18:49:37] <realpap> im using and it doesnt adds the class
[18:49:40] <ajpiano> addClass will take care of adding the class attribute
[18:49:52] <realpap> mm let me check my code
[18:50:08] <holodoc> How does your line look like? The one zou are using to add the class.
[18:54:00] <realpap> i tried in http://jsfiddle.net and works
[18:54:05] <realpap> but not on my wordpress blog
[18:54:14] <realpap> i must be doing something wrong
[18:54:52] <realpap> http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/3/ i run that on wordpress and doesnt adds the class :/
[18:58:19] <holodoc> Is your code wrapped inside a $(document).ready() block?
[18:58:56] <boopaloop> when developing a plugin and storing general data that doesn't apply to individual elements, is it better to store it in $.data(document.body) for example, or to return an object with the data inside? the plugin is called via $.myPlugin in this case (not called with a selector)
[18:59:15] <realpap> yes holodoc
[18:59:26] <realpap> i think i must be linkin wrong to jquery
[18:59:31] <realpap> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script> im using that
[18:59:38] <realpap> maybe its wrong
[18:59:48] <holodoc> Check to see if you are actually loading jQuery
[18:59:56] <realpap> yeah that must be the problem
[19:00:18] <holodoc> Thats most likely wrong for wordpress
[19:02:39] <realpap> im researching how to link the jquery
[19:03:43] <realpap> fixed
[19:03:56] <realpap> <script type="text/javascript" src="<?php bloginfo("template_url"); ?>/jquery.js"></script>
[19:14:26] <phxheat> what would be the best way to get all elements on a page that have an ID that starts with: titleLink_ ?
[19:15:19] <phxheat> n/m, going to be a diff method
[20:14:31] <richardr> Are there any jQuery interface libraries out there that (sort of) mimic a tiling window manager? For example; I make a request, I get a response which populates 100% of the screen. Make another request, get a response, these two responses now share 100% of the screen (50% each), and so on. If you close one, you get that screen real estate back. Any solutions that do this already, that aren't OTT?
[20:15:29] <ajpiano> richardr: i've never used this but it exists http://layout.jquery-dev.net/
[20:16:53] <richardr> ajpiano: Thanks, sort of what I'm after. Might fork it ;-)
[20:21:34] <richardr> ajpiano: Do you know any others similar to that by any chance?

[21:42:33] <abjorn> cause knockout's data binding is pretty ideal, I think
[21:42:47] <abjorn> but I don't need client side templates or single page apps or any of that
[21:42:52] <coldhead> boo ya https://github.com/nlogax/react.js
[21:43:11] <coldhead> haven't used it or looked at it but that's what he was working on
[21:43:59] <abjorn> well that's
[21:44:06] <abjorn> a node module sooo
[21:44:14] <coldhead> is it?
[21:44:22] <abjorn> line 10
[21:44:22] <abjorn> exports.EventStream  = EventStream;
[21:44:25] <abjorn> pretty sure
[21:45:34] <coldhead> oh well
[21:45:38] <coldhead> here's another suggestion
[21:45:43] <coldhead> SHUTU UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE
[21:45:48] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:45:53] <abjorn> mehhhh i could try and recreate it, but soooo much wooork
[21:45:53] <coldhead> i have never been so insulted
[21:45:54] <abjorn> oh right
[21:45:54] <coldhead> etc
[21:45:58] <abjorn> i always forget that
[21:46:01] <abjorn> its your first day
[21:46:06] <coldhead> i don't even know what knockout is
[21:46:28] <abjorn> http://knockoutjs.com/
[21:46:28] <abjorn> It's cool, but to date I've never had a project that called for a full on framework
[21:46:52] <abjorn> I'm pretty sure there are more JavaScript frameworks than there are sites that actually need a JavaScript framework.
[21:47:58] <abjorn> meh maybe ill write a jQuery plugin for data binding. All the ones on the plugin repo suk
[21:50:57] <danzik171> abjorn: Including the official data link plugin?  ( have not used it )
[21:51:36] <abjorn> wow that one actually slipped my mind
[21:51:39] <abjorn> completely
[21:53:02] <abjorn> hmmmm maybe
[21:53:12] <abjorn> thanks danzik171
[21:59:02] <coldhead> the MICROSOFT data link plugin?
[21:59:03] <coldhead> lol
[22:14:58] <coldhead> bot-t: is temp01 really back?
[22:14:58] <bot-t> coldhead, As I see it, yes.
[22:15:12] <coldhead> bot-t: but is he REALLY?
[22:15:13] <bot-t> coldhead, Outlook good.
[22:16:18] <gf3> wow
[22:25:01] <sequencers> Eviltwin, greetings
[22:25:09] <gf3> nope
[22:40:19] <sequencers> Eviltwin, are you available ?
[22:44:39] <Eviltwin> sequencers: No, sorry, I have some work I have to get done
[22:44:53] <sequencers> that's cool
[23:07:25] <ProLoser|Work> is it possible to control scrolling from within an iframe?
[23:07:42] <ProLoser|Work> like for facebook apps where the iframe does not contain scrollbars? (so positioning of the parent)
[23:08:23] <Cork> ProLoser|Work: the iframe can control its own scrollbars, yes
[23:08:29] <Cork> but the parent can't
[23:09:40] <ProLoser|Work> ever work with facebook?
[23:09:57] <ProLoser|Work> for fb apps, your app is in an iframe, but they stretch the iframe so it does not contain scrollbars
[23:10:01] <Cork> ProLoser|Work: no, but i know that much of what they do is blocked now days
[23:10:13] <ProLoser|Work> what they do is blocked?
[23:10:19] <ryanseddon> ProLoser|Work: facebook uses a proxy to load your fb app so it can adjust its height
[23:10:55] <Cork> ProLoser|Work: modern browsers don't let the parent get the information, or scroll info
[23:10:56] <ryanseddon> ProLoser|Work: is your parent page and iframe on the same domain?
[23:30:19] <Sid_> Hello
[23:30:22] <Silverguy> So I have a div, and then in that div 2 more divs, and in one of those divs a list. I would like to select all the list items and add a class to them using the first div. How would i do that
[23:41:44] <faraway> hi, i know that i could query for elements in an frames document by using jQuery("selector", iframesDocument) but is it somehow possible to load a script into the iframe from the parent (the frames document is in the same domain, but does not have jQuery loaded)
[23:46:44] <slavka`2> string userType = _queryUser.FirstOrDefault().UserType.UserTypeName;   >>> throwing the following error .......... Object reference not set to an instance of an object. , any ideas guys?
