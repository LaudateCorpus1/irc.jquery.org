[02:14:10] <senaps> hi all, im creating a demo app using jquery and html, it's going to be on a reactjs later, but for now, every thing is handled in jquery. is there a way to save data?(not in a db!) i am creating objects and i want these objects to be kept alive untill the tab is closed!:) so that when i switch between tabs and pages data are kept alive!...this is j
[02:14:10] <senaps> ust a demo i dont want any best practices and stuff like that
[02:21:09] <Cork> senaps: a page doesn't lose data cause you switch between tabs
[02:21:18] <Cork> or by tabs do you mean something in the page?
[02:29:57] <senaps> i mean switching between pages. i want to create a html variable, append data to that and then append it all in the html page, and still have all that data after switching to other page and comming back! i guess im trying to do what i should be doing in react or angular, but im wonderring if it's possible in jquery?  jquery.data?
[02:35:51] <Cork> senaps: that will consume a lot of data
[02:36:05] <Cork> meaning it isn̈́'t a super grate idea
[02:36:44] <Cork> it is normally better to just ajax fetch the data again, if you set the not changed headers and so on the browser will serve it from cache
[02:40:58] <senaps> can i store and remove the json to a file? is that better?
[02:43:13] <sahbeewah> localstorage
[02:54:24] <Cork> but note storing it in localstorage means the browser will have to load all of it into memory for every time a page is rendered from your domain
[02:54:58] <Cork> aka, the bad memory situation i talked about before (and it will also slowdown rendering of initial load as it has to be done before the page can be rendered)
[03:03:36] <senaps> i don't have such a big data to be worrying about, but still may not use it! since i cant assign multi line html to a variable for it to hold! :)  i want to render a html.div (populate it) and append it to the page... have no idea on how to deal with it:(
[03:10:48] <sahbeewah> it loads a pointer to a hash map… it’s not a big deal
[03:11:08] <sahbeewah> serialize/stringify whatever you need into the variable, and store
[03:16:32] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/6z2mwm1w/ giving that i have this variable info, can i edit and add to this variable? i want to add more tags with class names of rownum and name and application?    ? in other words, can i edit text inside a variable?
[03:21:00] <senaps> i found it... thanks every body
[04:04:51] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/ztxobbx5/  why is this code, not inserting to the tags? i can print print out value.id, value.name and value.ip. i have two datas built, but i dont have lines 6,7,8 working!(inserting data )
[04:24:28] <Woet> senaps: why dont you create a working demo?
[04:27:35] <senaps> i just started it this way, this is a team project, i just want to use a code that i can later copy paste, refactor and have it done on angular or react. i can't make anymore decisions on this.
[04:29:01] <senaps> now, i have fixed the problem, but managed to come up with another! :)  so the problem is that i have to store the replace lines(6,7,8) on a variable and then return that variable! tha problem is how would i edit...? i got an idea! let me test it and then complete the question if it didn't work! :)
[08:45:28] <senaps> http://jsfiddle.net/u63j17cs/  i have made this code, will something like it to work on a list of data! but i have refactored it so it takes one data object. and it doesn't work anymore! no error is thrown.
[08:45:49] <senaps> i need a fresh eye to look at it.... thanks guys...
[08:49:59] <MikeD_> senaps: it needs more comments to explain what you are thinking is supposed to be happening
[08:51:19] <MikeD_> all parent() isn't anything either
[08:52:20] <jpleau_> Hi. My page is https://foo.com/bar/foo . In that page I have an ajax call (with $.ajax), the url is set to "../blah". My issue is that the ajax call tries to go over HTTP instead of HTTPS, even if the page is loaded with HTTPS. What is wrong? This project is using jquery 1.11.3
[08:54:10] <jpleau_> bahhh, nevermind.
[08:54:50] <Cork> that would only happen if something modifyed the request or the url
[08:55:29] <Cork> urls are just strings to jquery btw, so if something like that happens it isn't jquery doing anything
[08:56:20] <jpleau_> Cork: yeah, I just noticed that there was a rule in the htaccess file that added a trailing '/' if it was missing, and the redirect didn't happen in https, sad sad
[08:56:47] <Cork> heh classic!
[08:56:53] <Cork> been there done that :D
[08:57:52] <senaps> MikeD_ this code is supposed to edit the info html code and insert the data from groupsdata to it. i have edited the code for debuging to test everything...i have no idea whats happening now :(
[08:58:34] <senaps> this code works for array of data! :)  http://jsfiddle.net/05k3z6dg/ it's not clean, but does the job and needs refactoring....
[08:59:11] <senaps> but i need it to take the table<row of it actually!> and get one object data and return only one row of data...
[09:03:03] <senaps> anybody has any idea on my code?
[09:17:00] <senaps> How can i read the object that is returned to page from firefox console? i see the object and it's lenght but can't see what's in it
[09:20:12] <Cork> senaps: you mean see the properties of the object?
[09:20:15] <Cork> just click it
[12:31:55] <mikunos> hello guys, I need to unselect the user color selection in this page http://tiny.cc/5jfloy by the javascript but I don't find any clue. Could anyone show me the right way to do it?

[15:08:40] <poboy> so var data has what I need, but it's not available in the view.  how do I need to pass it in?  https://kopy.io/pU4kt
[16:24:04] <bjsnider> a couple of these ajax functions are slapping a query string on the end of the url afterwards. any idea why?
[16:24:44] <taplar> ?
[16:30:30] <bjsnider> also does it with empty success function and no data going in either direction
[16:31:16] <taplar> what ajax calls are you doing that you are seeing the query string on it?
[16:32:59] <bjsnider> i've got 2 that are doing that and one that isn't, so obviously i'm trying to figure out the difference
[16:33:18] <taplar> k
[16:33:25] <bjsnider> i'm using type=post, url is the same page
[16:33:50] <bjsnider> data is just objects, but now the troublesome one is empty
[16:34:08] <taplar> what's the query string that is magically appearing on the requests?
[16:34:30] <bjsnider> in the console it's saying "navigated to..." but nothing useful
[16:35:59] <bjsnider> the query string is coming from a radio input, so ?name=value
[16:36:10] <bjsnider> and it's only that one input, although there are 7 others
[16:36:32] <taplar> ok, well, you're being very vague so I can't really help you debug if you don't share what you are doing
[16:37:18] <bjsnider> unfortunately when i google this i just get abunch of people trying to deliberately do this
[18:13:17] <zizzl> Hey all, simple question, is there a way to reference the ".first" without repeating it again like in here $('.first').width( $('.first').closest('.second').width() )
[18:13:33] <zizzl> I thought 'this' would work but it doesn't
[18:20:05] <zizzl> $('.first').width( $(this).closest('.second').width() ) for eample
[18:45:45] <catbadger> qut up?
[18:45:49] <catbadger> wut
[18:46:05] <catbadger> I'm wrestling with jqgrid. anyone familiar?
[18:46:36] <catbadger> Multi-select is on but the  header check all box is not showing. just wondering if there's another option for it.
[19:37:06] <snufft> hi everyone :)
[19:37:19] <snufft> I'm trying to manipulate some text from CKEditor input.
[19:37:51] <snufft> I've got a CKEditor instance where I need to wrap any tables that have been pasted into it, in a div
[19:38:20] <snufft> wait, think i've spotted something
[21:12:48] <Odyss3us> so $().height() returns screen height regardless of where it is on the page?\\
