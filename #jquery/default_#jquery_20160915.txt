[00:51:53] <Null_> hey guys, i want to connect to azure sql, i'm kind of new to sql and am confused do I need to use something like sequalize?
[00:52:07] <Null_> or can I just use tedious connector
[00:57:07] <Uhkis> how is that a jquery question
[03:35:21] <momomo> when I do e.attr('selected', 'true') or whatever other value .. I keep getting the attribute to be selected='selected'
[03:35:23] <momomo> whyyy?
[03:35:42] <momomo> i can bypass this by get(0).setAttribute but still wierd
[03:54:36] <shoky> momomo: you should use  .prop('selected', true)
[03:54:43] <shoky> and not care about the attribute
[03:55:19] <shoky> unless you're trying to use this as a custom attribute for your own data
[03:55:26] <shoky> then you should be using .data() instead
[03:55:53] <Duikb00t> o/
[04:00:36] <Duikb00t> Yo Cork ;)
[04:01:37] <momomo> why prop? will it come out as selected??
[04:01:46] <momomo> can I do find('...') ?
[04:02:07] <Cork> momomo: selected is a property on the option, not an attribute
[04:02:15] <Cork> momomo: it is a state of the dom element
[04:02:31] <Cork> attributes would be a text strings with no effect on the state
[04:03:20] <shoky> momomo: if you want to be able to to find(...) on it then maybe you just want to add a class..   .addClass('selected')
[04:03:29] <shoky> .find('.selected')
[04:03:51] <shoky> saying what your purpose is helps ;p
[04:03:56] <Cork> or just use $(':selected)
[04:04:14] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[04:08:28] <momomo> or just give jqueyr the big finger and use setAttribute ?
[04:08:54] <Cork> momomo: you shouldn't use attributes for state
[04:09:01] <Cork> attr is exactly the same as setAttribute
[04:09:04] <momomo> and regret the day that I decided to use the unthrustworthy jquery attr everywhere
[04:09:07] <Cork> and that is the problem
[04:09:12] <momomo> Cork,no it is not here
[04:09:23] <momomo> selected is some kind of special property
[04:09:30] <Cork> uh
[04:09:42] <Cork> setAttribute doesn't set properties
[04:09:50] <momomo> special attribute
[04:09:54] <momomo> jeeeezus
[04:09:59] <Cork> ...
[04:10:12] <Cork> firstly what is the element you're working with?
[04:10:14] <momomo> a
[04:10:17] <momomo> <a>
[04:10:35] <Cork> ok, first problem don't set random attributes without data- prefix
[04:10:40] <momomo> anyhow, it is not a big issue .. i can get around it .. but costed me a few extra minutes
[04:11:05] <Cork> .attr('data-selected', 'true') or .addClass('selected') sounds like what you want
[04:11:29] <Cork> momomo: what you're doing has quite sever problems though...
[04:11:30] <momomo> no, what i want is attr('selected', true) because I dont like appeneding data attrbitues
[04:11:48] <momomo> sever, how?
[04:11:50] <Cork> momomo: you prefer having nave conflicts?
[04:11:56] <momomo> Cork, eventually yes
[04:12:07] <Cork> cause data- prefixed attributes is the only attributes not reserved by specs
[04:12:40] <Cork> it was explicitly added to allow authors to add extra attributes without forcing specs to work around them later
[04:12:47] <momomo> i'll take my chances .. but I am going to start appending data on attributes now .. its too late .. and the data syntax is too expensive ( css wise )
[04:12:56] <Cork> but... WHY???
[04:13:01] <momomo> Cork, i understand the need
[04:13:06] <Duikb00t> Is there a fast way to add: http://kopy.io/drEbQ all of the values of the <a> into 1 array?
[04:13:19] <Cork> it is just a few letters in the name, why do you have a problem with it?
[04:13:20] <Duikb00t> Should I make use of '$.each'?
[04:13:39] <momomo> so attr('selected', true') !+ setAttribute, are we clear on that ?
[04:13:47] <momomo> !=
[04:13:49] <Cork> it is
[04:13:56] <Cork> that isn't the problem
[04:14:14] <Cork> the problem is <a selected="true"> vs <a data-selected="true">
[04:14:21] <momomo> how can it be when I get too different results  ?
[04:14:30] <momomo> forget about the data .. it's a choice i've made
[04:14:38] <momomo> two
[04:14:40] <Cork> the problem is you expect type casting of true to "true"
[04:14:51] <Cork> attributes can only contains strings
[04:14:57] <momomo> no.. i even tried with 'penis'
[04:15:05] <momomo> same thing -> selected='selected'
[04:15:53] <momomo> have to jumo into the shower
[04:15:53] <Cork> momomo: https://jsfiddle.net/9h3650pm/
[04:16:16] <Cork> momomo: also https://jsfiddle.net/9h3650pm/1/
[04:16:29] <momomo> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/9h3650pm/
[04:16:50] <Cork> ?
[04:16:57] <momomo> it pops up selected
[04:16:58] <momomo> right ?
[04:17:08] <Cork> you just sent me back my own link'
[04:17:38] <momomo> oh.. i must haven ot saved
[04:18:04] <momomo> here is the first : https://jsfiddle.net/9h3650pm/2/
[04:18:27] <momomo> here is the end of discusssion:   https://jsfiddle.net/9h3650pm/1/
[04:18:42] <momomo> fucking jsfiddle
[04:18:44] <momomo> it's shit
[04:18:50] <Cork> momomo: just don't use reserved names...
[04:19:05] <Cork> just add data- in the front of the attribute and the problem doesn't exist
[04:19:16] <Cork> you SHOULD NOT USE THE UN PREFIXED NAMESPACE!
[04:19:30] <Cork> dammit...
[04:19:35] <momomo> here is the end of discussion
[04:19:36] <momomo> https://jsfiddle.net/9h3650pm/4/
[04:19:48] <momomo> that's not hte discuission here!
[04:19:56] <momomo> canyou stop mentioning the god damn data attribute
[04:19:57] <momomo> ??
[04:20:08] <momomo> the question now is that attr behaves differnt from setAttribute
[04:20:18] <momomo> jquery puts its own gay touch on it
[04:20:26] <Cork> momomo: ya, cause you're doing something that is horribly bad
[04:20:38] <momomo> whatever ... earler someone stated that they are the same
[04:20:41] <momomo> they are not!
[04:20:43] <Cork> and if it is done by a framework is breaking the web...
[04:20:45] <momomo> can we agree on that?
[04:20:57] <Cork> they are the same as long as you're doing it right
[04:21:15] <momomo> they have different results depending on input
[04:21:19] <momomo> that's not the same
[04:21:19] <momomo> i can
[04:21:21] <momomo> t
[04:21:26] <momomo> keep track of all the fucking rules
[04:21:30] <momomo> i expect it to work
[04:21:35] <Cork> what you're seeing is that jquery has a value translator it uses for a few known attributes
[04:21:50] <momomo> yes, and now I cant trust it do WHAT I WANT
[04:21:53] <momomo> i am god here
[04:21:57] <Cork> attributes you should never collide with anywayy
[04:22:01] <momomo> i fucking decide
[04:22:13] <Cork> momomo: why, explain why...
[04:22:23] <Cork> you want to break the web cause you feel like it??
[04:23:48] <Cork> we're getting weirder and weirder names in the specs cause they have to avoid attributes used commonly by web authoers not saying out of the spec namespace
[04:23:53] <momomo> no, but I am not going to start using data everywhere just because the web might eventually use 10 out of millions of words
[04:24:16] <Cork> the spec guaratees to never use data- anything
[04:24:24] <momomo> and thats stupid
[04:24:28] <Cork> why?
[04:24:34] <momomo> instead they should introduce their own namespace
[04:24:37] <momomo> spec-attr
[04:24:49] <momomo> and let us have the freedom to elegantly name what we want
[04:24:51] <Cork> that would be inconsistent
[04:25:03] <Cork> as we would have to move href, src, selected, checked and everything else
[04:25:35] <Cork> (something that can't be done cause -- it would break the web)
[04:25:38] <momomo> no, they can stay .. from now on .. they can start using it ... instead of us having to start using data from now on ..
[04:25:49] <Cork> ...
[04:26:05] <Cork> wow... just wow.. i don't have an answer for that...
[04:26:15] <momomo> anyhow .. i just don't like the data attribute .. and the risk of running into collisions is minimal
[04:26:17] <Duikb00t> Cork:  I wrote some small piece of code which... works ;-) Are you maybe willing to code review it a little if can make it bette?  Don't want to make stupid mistakes anymore and want to learn it the right way  :-)
[04:26:20] <momomo> and in control
[04:26:48] <Duikb00t> Only 9 (lines) :P
[04:27:32] <momomo> Cork, sorry for ranting
[04:27:44] <Cork> momomo: it isn't the ranting that is the problem...
[04:27:58] <momomo> but i did expect that attr and setAttribute would do the same
[04:28:04] <Cork> they are
[04:28:44] <Cork> they just expect you to know what you're doing
[04:29:15] <momomo> also, attr only covers the cases right now .. so if I use .attr('penis', '' ) and spec later says that penis is good attribute .. then jquery would break exisiting code .. when it adds it later when I update the jquery lib .. so it actually doesnt solve anything by acting on my behalf
[04:29:39] <momomo> it would change the behaviour of my code
[04:29:49] <momomo> also, the data specification was added in html5, right?
[04:29:59] <momomo> so all those that updated now also have different behaviour
[04:30:01] <Cork> no it is added in html
[04:30:07] <momomo> i have to go now
[04:30:10] <momomo> sorry
[04:30:10] <Cork> html5 is marketing for "modern and cook"
[04:30:14] <Cork> *cool
[04:31:13] <robhol> Heya. I need to load a page as html, ideally being able to search through it with regular $(...) selectors, but without loading any of its external content due to mixed content errors... any idea how to do that?
[04:31:49] <Cork> robhol: is the html from the same domain?
[04:31:55] <robhol> yes
[04:32:00] <Cork> then sure
[04:32:25] <robhol> but apparently it's a bit messed up, because even if I specify https:// or just // the mixed content policy still trips it up somehow
[04:32:40] <Cork> hmm
[04:32:45] <Cork> you have a link?
[04:32:59] <Cork> mixed content only comes from hard coded http://
[04:34:21] <robhol> no link, but I'm browsing the source and it doesn't look like anything refers to http://stuff except for doctype declaration and xmlns
[04:34:57] <robhol> and scripts, unless I'm wrong, shouldn't actually be loaded when I just do $(receivedData)
[04:36:46] <Cork> robhol: ya, but i meant do you have a link to this "source"?
[04:36:56] <Cork> hard to help without anything to look at
[04:38:57] <Cork> (and by link i meant a link where the mixed content warning is shown if you run it)
[04:42:11] <robhol> no link, I'm afraid
[04:42:40] <Cork> pitty, hard to help you fix the real problem then (there the fix should be done)
[04:42:58] <Cork> robhol: what you would have to do is fetch the html with ajax
[04:43:02] <AdamPDotty> more freedom to wildly guess
[04:43:16] <robhol> not my page anyway, and it's internal. still, it doesn't seem to actually load any mixed content, hence my confusion
[04:43:19] <Cork> then regex find all the hrefs and src attributes in the text body
[04:43:23] <Cork> rip them out
[04:43:27] <Cork> and then parse the html into dom
[04:43:38] <Cork> robhol: it does
[04:43:50] <Cork> might be inside the js files or something
[04:44:05] <Cork> robhol: the simplest solution is to go into the browsers settings enable mixed content loading
[04:44:15] <Cork> then open the network tab and look for the http:// request
[04:44:21] <Cork> it will be there
[04:44:39] <Cork> (optionally the file:// request)
[04:47:19] <robhol> firebug doesn't show any http requests when opening the page directly
[04:48:10] <Cork> and no mixed request blocked comment in the page info?
[04:48:26] <Cork> (to the left of the url field)
[04:49:10] <robhol> not that i can see
[04:49:18] <robhol> I suspect it would be fairly obvious?
[04:49:34] <Cork> should be a small icon
[04:50:38] <robhol> green padlock and a small info icon
[04:50:44] <Cork> click it
[04:50:45] <robhol> nothing about mixed content if i open them
[04:50:49] <Cork> ok
[04:51:13] <Cork> not sure what it is without seeing the request info
[04:51:52] <robhol> well, unless firebug is wrong, not a single request was made by anything (including scripts) over plain http
[04:53:07] <Cork> robhol: try setting the browser to allow mixed content
[04:53:12] <robhol> I did
[04:53:14] <Cork> and run the code where you get the warning
[04:53:21] <robhol> hm
[04:53:24] <Cork> (not a plain request)
[04:53:30] <Cork> then you should see what the cause is
[04:53:44] <Cork> the server might send you different content based on if it is ajax or a normal http
[04:54:08] <Cork> (also don't forget to check the headers)
[04:54:24] <robhol> it.. it sends the request as http. what the fuck.
[04:54:38] <Cork> there you go :)
[04:54:43] <robhol> wait, no, that was me, for testing purposed
[04:54:45] <robhol> s
[04:55:54] <robhol> ... no, it's something wrong - the script definitely tries https now, and it still pops up as http and triggers the mixed content warning
[04:56:12] <Cork> check the response headers
[04:56:37] <Cork> you might have a location: http://...
[04:57:17] <ircbaako> hi guys am using footable dont know if you of you have used it before. Anyways I have a class called "footable" but this call is not available when the page loads and therefor $('.footable').footable(); doesnt work. Is they a way to add a document selector to this?
[04:58:17] <Cork> ircbaako: are you running your code inside $(function() {}) ?
[04:58:47] <ircbaako> Cork,
[04:58:59] <ircbaako> my code is wrap in a function but not the document ready one
[04:59:14] <Cork> and what calls the function?
[05:00:29] <ircbaako> the section which loads next tab. The tab is not loaded when the page loads, it only loads on demand
[05:00:46] <ircbaako> but the function where the footable is, is in the index page
[05:00:58] <Cork> then you have to make sure the new content is loaded when the selector runs
[05:01:16] <Cork> (not before)
[05:02:21] <ircbaako> Cork, the section has loaded and i then called the function callfootable(); on console but still got (index):155 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).footable is not a function(…)
[05:02:45] <Cork> ah, that isn't cause the element isn't found
[05:02:51] <Cork> it is cause the lib isn't loaded
[05:02:55] <Cork> so footable doesn't exist
[05:04:50] <ircbaako> Cork, am silly
[05:08:31] <ircbaako> Cork, am confused now. when i search the html element i can clearly see class="transaction table table-bordered table-hover footable"
[05:08:40] <ircbaako> but the selector says it cannot find it
[05:08:47] <Cork> no it doesn't
[05:08:57] <Cork> footable is not a function(…) <--
[05:09:04] <Cork> means $.fn.footable doesn't exist
[05:09:10] <Cork> meaning the plugin footable isn't loaded
[05:09:16] <Cork> it has nothing to do with the html
[05:12:53] <ircbaako> Cork, it is loaded. Because on the elements i can right click on it and open it in a new chrome tab
[05:12:57] <ircbaako> and can see the js
[05:13:26] <ircbaako> they is no other error on console apart from warning which is from chrome
[05:14:07] <Cork> ircbaako: make sure you don't load multiple jquery versions
[05:24:09] <ircbaako> Cork, thanks. This guy including over 5 different versions of jquery. Dont know why but i deleted some
[05:24:25] <Cork> :)
[05:24:47] <Cork> ircbaako: wanted to live on the edge?
[05:25:01] <Cork> never knowing what code you actually ran, or what plugins you actually had loaded :D
[05:25:56] <Cork> (btw some should be all but one)
[05:36:51] <ircbaako> ahaha
[05:37:10] <ircbaako> so far i havent nothing any error
[05:42:28] <BenBornschein> hello
[05:44:21] <BenBornschein> I have a question: I use $('.myElements').on('submit', 'form', function () { doStuff(); }); to many elements. How can I get a list of events, what function is registered to a single element?
[05:46:01] <Cork> BenBornschein: there isn't really a reliable way to get all the events bound to the dom
[05:46:18] <BenBornschein> .myElements is one of n div-containers, each container has a form with a name for example <form name="form123">. how can I get the registered event of "submit" and the function?
[05:46:20] <Cork> jquery keeps a list of the event handlers it has bound, but it isn't a guarantee
[05:46:22] <BenBornschein> is there no way?
[05:46:36] <BenBornschein> I would need the information just for debugging
[05:46:39] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[05:46:45] <BenBornschein> doesn't work :(
[05:46:58] <Cork> make sure elm is the element, not a jquery wrapper
[05:47:18] <Cork> meaning $('.myElement')[0]
[05:47:39] <Cork> and ya, this should only be used for debugging
[05:47:42] <Cork> never for production use
[05:47:56] <Cork> (and i'm not sure this works in 3.x+)
[05:48:07] <BenBornschein> $._data(document.getElementsByName('product317'), 'events'); result is "undefined"
[05:48:29] <BenBornschein> I'm using jQuery 2.1.4
[05:48:31] <Cork> uh by name?
[05:48:43] <Cork> you have a <product317> element?
[05:48:56] <BenBornschein> aah sorry, my fault
[05:49:30] <Cork> also by name and by class gives you a list not an element
[05:50:24] <BenBornschein> How can I access <form name="product317"> so that $._data() can work with it
[05:50:47] <Cork> $('form[name="product317"]')[0]
[05:51:12] <BenBornschein> $._data($('form[name="product317"]')[0], 'events'); result is undefined
[05:51:29] <Cork> BenBornschein: https://jsfiddle.net/131av0x5/
[05:54:23] <BenBornschein> hmm, your code works fine, I don't know why my code won't work
[05:55:12] <BenBornschein> if I do something like this $('[data-product]').on('submit', 'form', function (e) {}); twice, I would register the event twice to the same element, right?
[05:56:12] <Cork> yes
[05:56:22] <BenBornschein> okay thank you very much :)
[05:57:01] <Cork> BenBornschein: or more specifically you should get events: { submit: [ entry1, entry2 ] }
[05:58:37] <shoky> BenBornschein if you're adding the handler on a parent element and not on the form... then you won't see a handler on the <form>
[06:00:21] <Cork> ah.. damn i missed that
[06:00:42] <Cork> ya, the event is registered on .myElement, not the form
[06:01:03] <Cork> that is why you don't find the event handler
[06:01:04] <BenBornschein> so in my case the event is registered $('[data-product]').on('submit', 'form', function (e) {}); to [data-product] and not the form?
[06:01:14] <shoky> in the fiddle too
[06:01:18] <Cork> no it is the data-product parent
[06:01:42] <Cork> look for a parent with an attribute data-product
[06:01:50] <shoky> that's what he said ;p
[06:02:02] <Cork> >_<'
[06:02:15] <Cork> me reading fail
[06:02:20] <shoky> lulz
[06:02:38] <BenBornschein> :) I really appreciate your help
[06:33:54] <LucaJJ> anyone have any experience with this plugin https://github.com/pavelk2/social-feed
[09:00:29] <Fenikkusu> How would I go about intercepting calls to .val() within a widget?
[09:25:30] <eddy> [{"error":"No data found"}] is what i get from JSON.parse but can i not check if it has a "error" like this obj.hasOwnProperty('error')
[09:28:51] <momomo> how do you inspect an element javascript properties in chrome ??
[09:29:52] <shoky> eddy: you have an array with an object inside. the array doesn't have have an 'error' property
[09:33:04] <eddy> shoky, thanks
[09:46:22] <momomo> how do you get an elements offset from a wrapping parent -> parent -> parent container
[09:46:23] <momomo> ?
[09:48:14] <momomo> ook x.offset() seems to do that
[09:55:05] <Alturic> Hey guys, if I had a div like so  <div id="div1"></div>, how can I check to see if that div is empty? $('div#div1').length == 0 should check that, no?
[09:57:57] <Uhkis> Alturic: $('#div1').text().length
[09:58:09] <jerit> or you could use .html().length
[09:58:14] <Uhkis> Alturic: dont prepend the div
[09:59:40] <decx> .html().trim().length
[10:00:35] <Uhkis> decx: whitespace has feelings too!
[10:01:03] <Alturic> Hmm, would this work if I'm using $.when( //getJSONstuff ).then(function() { }); if the getJSONstuff could be manipulating elements? the .then doesn't execute until after the JSON is all returned, correct?
[10:01:16] <decx> you'd think white-space would vote for trim()p
[10:12:24] <spaceman> is there a simple way to read the params of a url string?
[10:12:53] <spaceman> i can see some solutions that work with a getUrlParams function, but is this overkill?
[10:37:54] <decx> there's a lot of edge cases for a deparam
[10:39:37] <decx> ie for ?blah[]=1&blah[]=2&blah[]=3  a simple split at & won't suffice to create an array blah = [1,2,3]
[11:05:47] <agnitio> I’ve got a multiselect dropdown and I want to see which values have been selected. How do I do that? http://pastebin.com/3JbXnLnR
[11:30:26] <decx> why use a plugin for a built in function?
[11:33:38] <decx> damnit, alway half an hour late today ^^
[11:34:10] <taplar> :)
[11:59:54] <taplar> hmm, i wonder if it's because i'm pasting from microsoft word
[12:35:04] <heedly> Why does this never get executed? http://pastebin.com/zHb7RJcL
[12:35:48] <taplar> uh, i don't think $.ready is a thing
[12:36:25] <taplar> $(document).ready(function(){ ... }) or just $(function(){ ... });
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> $().ready( handler ) works, too.
[12:39:03] <robertmaxrees> hell, $( "img" ).ready( handler ) does the exact same thing.
[12:48:37] <taplar> many ways to get ready
[13:11:24] <Ziberius> hello
[13:11:37] <duch_kazatel> good morning./
[13:11:48] <Ziberius> I have a little bootstrap issue
[13:11:59] <Ziberius> http://pastebin.com/zm66vHec
[13:12:03] <Ziberius> this is my navbar
[13:12:20] <duch_kazatel> in the interest of getting you help as quickly as possible:
[13:12:34] <Ziberius> but when viewing on smaller screens the navbar is not totally hidden, I can still see a small empty bar
[13:12:41] <duch_kazatel> there's a ##bootstrap available.  you can feel free to ask here, though you'll have much more luck with a test case.
[13:13:03] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: thanx I already asked there but no answer
[13:13:09] <Ziberius> you mean test case on fiddle?
[13:13:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:13:22] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: ok i'll try to build one
[13:15:44] <Ziberius> is a link ok?
[13:15:51] <robertmaxrees> to a fiddle sure
[13:16:26] <Ziberius> well in the meantime the actual site is http://altamira.desarrollosdvs.cl
[13:16:32] <Ziberius> any help is appreciated
[13:16:35] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle should be pretty quick to put together fwiw.
[13:16:50] <A124> hey. I would like to select and element and call action upon it (simulate button press). Not surehow to do that. The element is:  a.post-loadall.btn.btn-action
[13:16:53] <Ziberius> yeah i'll try haven't used it much
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> A124 .trigger()
[13:17:13] <A124> I can search the post-loadall no problem, no idea how to sellect the button though.
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> A124 select the element like you normally would with css.
[13:18:09] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9h7ot11o/
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> there's a basic fiddle with bootstrap and jquery included
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> just needs your html :)
[13:19:22] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: thanx :-)
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> A124 make sense?
[13:23:30] <robertmaxrees> Ziberius fwiw i don't want your entire page, just the html for the relevant part of the page.
[13:25:19] <Ziberius> yeah it's not reproducing well, i can't link to the imges on my site maybe it's that
[13:26:15] <Ziberius> nvm thanx anyway i'd rather try to solve it than spend more time on jsfiddle :-p
[13:26:21] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:26:26] <robertmaxrees> stick with it in the other channel.
[13:26:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[13:26:45] <Ziberius> ;-)
[13:28:05] <taplar> mmm, page loads 2.3mb of data...
[13:28:13] <Ziberius> my page?
[13:28:16] <taplar> yup
[13:28:24] <Ziberius> it's the background image
[13:28:30] <taplar> it's very slow loading for me
[13:28:31] <robertmaxrees> compress it.
[13:28:34] <robertmaxrees> big time.
[13:28:34] <Ziberius> i'll get to optimizing that
[13:29:05] <taplar> yeah, doesn't look like gzip is enabled
[13:30:00] <taplar> hmm, the jpeg is, just not the css or some other things
[13:30:06] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:30:17] <heedly> ok, I changed it to $(document).ready() and it still doesn't work..
[13:30:49] <robertmaxrees> heedly any console errors?
[13:31:17] <robertmaxrees> have you popped a console log in there and watch to see if it happens?
[13:33:12] <taplar> the issue may be the ajax
[13:33:21] <taplar> https://podio.github.io/jquery-mentions-input/
[13:33:31] <taplar> may.  i don't see an example with ajax on that page
[13:33:58] <Ziberius> there, smaller images :-)
[13:34:52] <taplar> better, though you still need to compress your css and allow for caching
[13:35:01] <Ziberius> taplar: oh ok
[13:35:06] <Ziberius> i'll look into that
[13:35:12] <Ziberius> once i fix the darn menu
[13:36:18] <taplar> are you talking about how it's collapsed and it's just a white bar?
[13:36:27] <Ziberius> taplar: yes indeed
[13:36:48] <Ziberius> I'm thinking about doing that manually with an independent button
[13:37:14] <Ziberius> would give me more flexibility anyways since I want the menu to appear from the left
[13:37:58] <taplar> it's your padding-bottom
[13:38:04] <taplar> is what is causing it to stay on screen
[13:38:33] <taplar> in your navbar-default class
[13:38:53] <Ziberius> heh
[13:38:56] <Ziberius> so it seems
[13:38:57] <Ziberius> thanx man
[13:39:04] <Ziberius> it was driving me crazy
[13:47:15] <taplar> mmm, hope you have a good spam filter
[13:48:01] <Ziberius> for posting the site?
[13:48:09] <Ziberius> it's just a temporary url anyways
[13:48:17] <taplar> you have your email address as a mailto
[13:48:27] <A124> robertmaxrees yeah, will try later, so many people distract at same time Thanks.
[13:48:29] <heedly> robertmaxrees: no console errors.
[13:48:34] <taplar> very easy for bots to mine and sell to spammers
[13:48:38] <robertmaxrees> heedly did you look at what taplar said?
[13:48:43] <Ziberius> taplar: oh good to know thanx
[13:58:05] <taplar> oh, lol
[13:58:05] <taplar> duh, it's inside the callback
[13:58:05] <taplar> 'this' has changed at that point
[13:58:40] <taplar> wakka wakka. heedly try setting var self = this outside the ajax call
[13:58:51] <decx> that mention plugin doesnt even trie
[13:58:52] <taplar> then use callback.call(self, data)
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> or .bind() the callback.
[13:59:20] <robertmaxrees> no need to do the self = this if you're going to use .bind()/.call() anyway
[13:59:37] <taplar> true
[14:11:22] <organatik> hellow
[14:11:25] <organatik> any can help
[14:11:30] <organatik> plz
[14:11:32] <organatik> need help
[14:11:40] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question
[14:11:45] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[14:11:56] <organatik> ok
[14:12:04] <organatik> i have 2 function
[14:12:15] <organatik> they run on click
[14:12:23] <organatik> on one buttin
[14:12:30] <organatik> button
[14:12:47] <organatik> i wanna that at first start  1 fucntion
[14:12:58] <organatik> than on other click next fuction
[14:13:26] <robertmaxrees> show us your html.
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> in a jsfiddle.
[14:14:26] <organatik> http://jsbin.com/lisizidudu/edit?js,console
[14:14:57] <organatik> first click must add blur
[14:15:06] <organatik> second click must remove blur
[14:15:11] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:15:15] <robertmaxrees> where's your html?
[14:15:27] <decx> init your overlay on load and then just hide and show it
[14:15:59] <organatik> need on click
[14:16:25] <decx> you can still do stuff on click, but creating and destroying the same thing doesnt make sense
[14:16:59] <organatik> ш иге щт сдшсл кгт 2 агтсешщт
[14:17:02] <organatik> y
[14:17:09] <organatik> but on click run 2 function
[14:17:12] <organatik> add
[14:17:15] <organatik> and remove
[14:17:24] <organatik> i need alternate
[14:17:54] <robertmaxrees> if you use classes to hide/show, you can detect if the class exists and run the correct logic.
[14:17:55] <organatik> setTimeout worl once
[14:18:28] <organatik> only one class for aad
[14:18:31] <organatik> and remove
[14:18:36] <organatik> add*
[14:18:38] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[14:19:58] <Ziberius> toggleClass?
[14:20:09] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, too.
[14:20:19] <robertmaxrees> if he has different logicm however, he might need to manually do it.
[14:20:33] <robertmaxrees> I tend to favor wiring it up manually in case i want to extend things more later.
[14:39:43] <organatik> ty
[14:39:44] <organatik> guys
[14:39:47] <organatik> it do it
[14:39:53] <organatik> with toggleClass
[14:53:20] <Onionnion> what's the difference between jQuery UI's Slider widget and jQuery Mobile's?
[14:53:48] <arschmitz> Onionnion: they have no real relation to each other
[14:54:02] <arschmitz> we plan on combining them in the future but it has not happened yet
[14:54:40] <Onionnion> ok good to know, thanks
[15:00:35] <Jayrui> Hey :), I have an ajax callback wich should remove all $(.error) elements and afterwards add some (with the append function). The problem is .remove doesn't remove the elements (Its working in the console and executing something different like .css() on the selector works). Any idea what the problem is?
[15:02:02] <Onionnion> odd, tabs aren't working on this device for some reason
[15:02:12] <arc_> idk, did you actually put $('.error') not $(.error)
[15:03:01] <Jayrui> yes, as I said when executing from the console the same line does what it should
[15:04:11] <arc_> sounds like the elements don't exist when your code runs
[15:04:15] <taplar> have you tried logging the length of the selector in the ajax callback?
[15:05:21] <Jayrui> yeah, the length is correct
[15:07:27] <Jayrui> oh... maybe its because I'm generating the elements which are selected in the same function?
[15:08:11] <taplar> *shrug* without seeing code, we're guessing
[15:10:05] <Jayrui> here is the code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/36f6f59ca12cdefc14b8491f9526018a
[15:11:02] <Jayrui> Okay I'm dumb
[15:11:16] <Jayrui> excuse me for stealing your time still learning coffee script
[15:11:26] <Jayrui> solved it :)
[15:11:45] <taplar> cool, cause i only drink coffee, ;)
[15:12:41] <arc_> i don't get what the benefit of not using semicolons is supposed to be
[15:13:44] <arc_> to me coffeescript just looks messy because of the exclusion of punctuation
[15:15:22] <taplar> you never learned a language and then tried to make another language look like that one? ;)
[15:16:14] <taplar> wiki "It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell in an effort..."
[15:58:50] <momomo> if you do : content.append(template); .... how can I get the appended element the best way?
[15:59:14] <momomo> is tehre a way to create and get a reference to the element prioer ? var selected = $(template); didnt work
[15:59:32] <taplar> what is template?
[16:00:05] <taplar> markup or just text?
[16:01:52] <momomo> text
[16:01:55] <momomo> its html
[16:01:58] <momomo> selected = content.append(template).find('>div:last-child'); didnt work
[16:02:06] <momomo> but is ugly too
[16:02:18] <taplar> so markup.  then var $template = $(template);  content.append($template); will work
[16:08:42] <momomo> taplar, yes, i must been doing something else wrong
[16:09:03] <momomo> however, i found $(template).appendTo(content) to be slightly bettter .. returns the element
[16:09:31] <taplar> sure
[16:09:56] <robertmaxrees> i always hated that setup.  not sure why.
[16:18:41] <momomo> is there a cost to moving an element that is at last position .. to the first? container.prepent(lastchild)
[16:18:42] <momomo> ?
[16:18:45] <momomo> rendering wise
[16:18:54] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:18:59] <robertmaxrees> it has to rerender a bunch of shit.
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> how much of a cost is the real question.
[16:19:50] <momomo> hmm .. it's that or container.find('> :not(.hide)') ...
[16:20:02] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> you having performance issues?
[16:20:20] <momomo> no .. its a framework build so should be done right
[16:20:26] <momomo> library
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> would you be moving more than one item at a time?
[16:20:57] <momomo> i had opted to move the element to first position so I don't have to keep track of last visible ... the first is the one
[16:21:04] <momomo> no ...
[16:21:10] <robertmaxrees> then just move it
[16:23:32] <momomo> e.find('>:not(.hide)') might be better .. althought its a search through all children .. maybe not as costly though
[16:23:53] <robertmaxrees> why are you using >:not() there?
[16:25:03] <robertmaxrees> why the direct descendent selector i mean.
[16:25:10] <momomo> to find the element that is not .hide .. so i can hide it
[16:25:21] <robertmaxrees> so you want .children()?
[16:25:22] <momomo> it should be the child of the element
[16:25:28] <robertmaxrees> .children().not('.hide')
[16:25:33] <robertmaxrees> i'll be that'll be a bit quicker.
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> *bet
[16:25:45] <momomo> really? hmm ..
[16:25:57] <taplar> by hiding are you just going to add the hide class?
[16:26:05] <momomo> basically
[16:26:12] <taplar> children().addClass('hide')
[16:26:15] <taplar> it won't double add
[16:27:36] <momomo> ook, i will look into these.. tomorrow .. long day
[16:27:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah something here seems way funkjy.
[17:39:51] <Onionnion> I'm having some trouble getting an update on change event to work for a slider, probably just with selecting the right element
[17:39:54] <Onionnion> http://codepen.io/ryanbreaker/pen/wzGVdE
[17:40:28] <Onionnion> I'm just trying to get it to update the span of .num immediately preceding the slider in the HTML with the value of the slider
[17:44:38] <robertmaxrees> Onionnion look at your console.
[17:45:40] <Onionnion> Ah. not a function, duh
[17:45:50] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:45:57] <decx> now console.log ui.handle
[17:46:47] <Onionnion> ahh, it's for the actual span element
[17:47:47] <Onionnion> ahhhhh ok
[17:48:11] <decx> get rid of the fat arrow and you'll be able to use 'this' to get your slider element
[17:49:00] <Onionnion> why does using 'this' not work under the => syntax?
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> because fat arrows bind to the barent context.
[17:49:11] <robertmaxrees> *parent
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> so 'this' can't get set by jquery.
[17:50:50] <decx> if you like your fat arrow to much you can use e.target i believe
[17:50:51] <Onionnion> sweet that works
[17:50:58] <decx> instead of this
[17:51:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:17:52] <Onionnion> I'm also having an issue with jQuery UI elements on Android 4.4
[18:17:58] <Onionnion> none of them seem to be appearing
[18:18:06] <robertmaxrees> gotta test case?
[18:20:00] <Onionnion> what do you mean?
[18:20:30] <robertmaxrees> A simplified page that shows the problem.
[18:20:41] <robertmaxrees> without any extraneous stuff.
[18:20:53] <Onionnion> not sure how I can show this issue regarding specifically this device to be honest
[18:21:00] <Onionnion> it only happens on it in its browser
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> you create the page and then somebody else hits it with that device.
[18:21:09] <robertmaxrees> or a device with that version.
[18:21:19] <Onionnion> Ah, yeah just that same one I linked before actually
[18:21:22] <Onionnion> that same codepen
[18:21:26] <robertmaxrees> link?
[18:21:53] <Onionnion> http://codepen.io/ryanbreaker/pen/wzGVdE
[18:22:13] <robertmaxrees> so you mean none of the styling gets applied?
[18:22:15] <Onionnion> the device this is specifically for is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4
[18:22:31] <Onionnion> none of the functionality is applied, such as the tabs or sliders
[18:22:47] <robertmaxrees> and you've confirmed you're not seeing it break on any other devices?
[18:23:52] <Onionnion> actually, doesn't work on my iPhone either
[18:24:10] <robertmaxrees> are you hitting the codepen directly?
[18:24:13] <robertmaxrees> or some other test page?
[18:24:51] <Onionnion> weird, yeah that was from my own test page on this actual project that they're not showing up, looks fine on Codepen on iPhone
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> are you serving the assets up from a cdn or from your own box?
[18:25:22] <robertmaxrees> perhaps there's a mismatch in protocol.
[18:25:58] <Onionnion> my own since it has to be packaged into an app later via PhoneGap
[18:26:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd check protocols and stuff then.
[18:26:17] <robertmaxrees> make sure everything is copascetic.
[18:26:38] <Onionnion> protocols as-in?
[18:26:45] <robertmaxrees> http vs https
[18:27:02] <robertmaxrees> ie the mobile browser is loading via https but you're trying to serve those assets via http
[18:27:31] <robertmaxrees> etc
[18:28:08] <Onionnion> that doesn't seem to be the case
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you hit using another computer?
[18:28:29] <robertmaxrees> and not a tablet/phone?
[18:30:24] <Onionnion> works fine on another computer on the LAN
[18:32:52] <Onionnion> may have found it
[18:33:08] <Onionnion> "[Error] SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable that shadows a global property: 'tabs' (anonymous function)" found in Safari's console
[18:34:57] <Onionnion> I had a "let tabs =" in my real code
[18:35:27] <Onionnion> changing the name lets it work in Safari but still not on this device
[18:36:22] <Onionnion> nor iPhone
[18:40:13] <Onionnion> yeah this is weird
[18:55:42] <Onionnion> wow this is weird
[18:55:52] <Onionnion> it's erroring out on this line and 1 other "var previousConsole = Object.assign({}, window.console);"
[18:55:58] <Onionnion> saying that .assign is undefined
[18:58:01] <Onionnion> sonofa
[18:58:09] <Onionnion> it was my 'let' keyword haha
[20:14:33] <RottenCore> hey people
[20:14:34] <RottenCore> anyone home?
[20:17:02] <RottenCore> I’m using this script: http://www.jqueryscript.net/form/Creating-A-Modern-Multi-Step-Form-with-jQuery-CSS3.html
[20:17:06] <RottenCore> and it works fine
[20:17:18] <RottenCore> but I want the form to auto-advance when the radio button is clicked
[20:17:22] <RottenCore> what’s the best way to do that?
[20:17:58] <RottenCore> I thought onchange='this.form.next()’ would work, but it doesn't
[20:48:09] <RottenCore> this place is like a ghost town after 5PM PST
