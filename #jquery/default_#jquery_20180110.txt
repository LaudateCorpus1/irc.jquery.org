[01:31:01] <senaps> how would i use inArray to search withing object values? https://jsfiddle.net/0cc414uL/
[01:31:32] <senaps> guess i have a list of objects defined like country, i want to search country names!
[01:31:50] <robertmaxrees> could you flesh that out into a valid example?
[01:34:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, nvm.
[01:34:32] <robertmaxrees> can't really do that.
[01:35:23] <senaps> https://jsfiddle.net/0cc414uL/2/
[01:35:54] <senaps> i want to check for name values of namesList now. is there some namesList.values() or something like that?
[01:36:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah, inArray doesn't really support an array of objects.
[01:37:33] <senaps> so, whats the best approach? iterate between list of names?
[01:37:43] <robertmaxrees> the native Array.prototype.some
[01:38:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0cc414uL/4/
[01:40:02] <senaps> this list might grow to thousands of objects.aha... thanks.
[01:40:32] <robertmaxrees> erm
[01:40:33] <robertmaxrees> wat
[01:40:35] <robertmaxrees> why?
[01:44:19] <senaps> :| that first part shouldn't have came! so my list is being pulled from the db, and most of the time has more than 500 elements.
[01:44:33] <senaps> what's currentName in your code? where did it come from?
[01:44:45] <robertmaxrees> senaps errrr.
[01:44:52] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things:
[01:45:07] <robertmaxrees> 1: i would highly recommend moving this check server-side.
[01:45:19] <robertmaxrees> 2: currentName can be anything.  you're just naming the argument.
[02:26:02] <undefined_bob> morning
[02:27:00] <robertmaxrees> good evening!
[02:28:43] <undefined_bob> I wish it would be evening already
[02:29:33] <Cork> it is always evening somewhere
[02:29:49] <undefined_bob> luckily
[02:29:54] <Cork> heh
[02:30:09] <Cork> having a rough day huh? :)
[02:30:30] <undefined_bob> everyday is rough at the moment
[02:30:44] <undefined_bob> and you? are you alright?
[02:30:51] <Cork> i'm just fine
[02:30:58] <undefined_bob> thats nice
[02:35:08] <undefined_bob> working on this but its still not done yet https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/VyyQVw
[02:37:24] <undefined_bob> this time the id is defined. feeling a little bis stupid because of yesterday
[02:39:03] <Cork> uh, why are you regex replacing the content of the id?
[02:41:38] <undefined_bob> because the href takes its content from id and the id can contain characters which are not allowed, like spaces
[02:42:00] <Cork> they are allowed in hashes
[02:42:06] <Cork> you can have anything in those
[02:42:26] <Cork> they just have to be urlencoded
[02:42:27] <undefined_bob> they are? people told me they are not allowed
[02:42:35] <Cork> nope
[02:43:10] <undefined_bob> even stuff like äüö -  and spaces?
[02:43:16] <Cork> sure
[02:43:21] <Cork> _anything_ :)
[02:43:27] <undefined_bob> aw
[02:43:54] <undefined_bob> really? then I dont need to clean and replace them because its okay?
[02:44:01] <Cork> ya
[02:44:33] <undefined_bob> puh I spent more than a day for that script
[02:45:07] <Cork> undefined_bob: https://jsfiddle.net/x1h2kb6w/
[02:45:15] <undefined_bob> I mean, I wondered why it shouldnt be allowed because it worked flawless with every character
[02:45:41] <Cork> prob ppl refering to really old standards, cause it didn't use to be allowed
[02:45:46] <Cork> but that was a long time ago
[02:46:33] <undefined_bob> ah ya that could be
[02:47:08] <undefined_bob> puh then I con stop melting my brain about this not existent issue
[02:48:03] <undefined_bob> so even something like that is valid? http://undefined.bplaced.net/das-sind-wir/index.html#I%20gonna%20be%20a%20map%20one%20day
[02:48:13] <Cork> sure
[02:48:21] <undefined_bob> and its w3c valid?
[02:48:24] <Cork> notice the %20
[02:48:24] <Cork> yes
[02:48:41] <Cork> as long as it is url encoded you can have anything in there
[02:48:58] <undefined_bob> yes the %20 is the space in the href
[02:49:01] <Cork> yes
[02:49:09] <Cork> that is why i pointed it out
[02:49:23] <undefined_bob> it just dont look nice but I think thats okay
[02:49:54] <Cork> well ya, i would prob have not used it, but that is completely different to "not allowed"
[02:50:31] <undefined_bob> yes, because not allowed mean I need to change something but "not nice" is okay
[02:51:15] <Cork> since the whatwg ids is "string" there isn't any limitation on its content
[02:51:35] <undefined_bob> but probably I keep up the work on the script to make it look nice too
[02:51:36] <Cork> before it was "[a-zA-Z1-9]" and had to start with a character
[02:51:49] <undefined_bob> yes, thats what people said
[02:51:50] <Cork> (1-9 could not be the first character)
[02:52:08] <Cork> ya, that haven't been true for closing in on 10 years
[02:52:15] <undefined_bob> lol
[02:52:45] <undefined_bob> thats a relief
[02:52:54] <undefined_bob> thank you for that information
[02:52:56] <Cork> whatwg is defining the html living standard that _all_ browsers support
[02:53:21] <Cork> and what for marketing is referred to as "html5"
[02:53:42] <Cork> (though html5 includes media encoding, javascript and css3 and so on)
[02:55:02] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you run your page though the w3c validator with the html5 doctype it should be valid (unless you have other errors)
[02:55:32] <undefined_bob> I'm going to try that later
[02:56:15] <Cork> you might want to save a static copy what generates the ids though
[02:56:20] <Cork> to get a real value from it
[02:58:38] <undefined_bob> hm, for now it said "Bad value #I gonna be a map one day for attribute href on element a: Illegal character in fragment: space is not allowed."
[02:59:01] <Cork> ya, so you haven't encoded the content when you put it into the attribute
[02:59:19] <Cork> browsers will "adjust" but you should url_encode it
[02:59:40] <undefined_bob> let me see
[02:59:51] <Cork> is this all done in js or do you do it server side?
[03:01:00] <Cork> in js just do encodeURI("I gonna be a map one day")
[03:01:06] <undefined_bob> its all done in js
[03:03:15] <Cork> hmm actually no
[03:03:22] <Cork> you want encodeURIComponent()
[03:07:23] <senaps> how would i access a value of specific key inside a loop? https://jsfiddle.net/0ymdzek3/ i want to iterate through the names only.
[03:08:20] <Cork> senaps: value.name
[03:16:34] <undefined_bob> Cork its a bit complicated. here is a snap of the code with create the href and id. maybe this explain it more. https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/PERoMO?editors=1000
[03:16:54] <undefined_bob> maybe their is a simpler solution and I just think to complicated again
[03:17:54] <Cork> undefined_bob: that has to go through some kind of template engine
[03:18:06] <undefined_bob> true
[03:18:17] <Cork> and that is where things needs to be fixed
[03:18:32] <Cork> ex. they might have a better solution to cc:print
[03:19:35] <undefined_bob> I added an example output
[03:20:30] <undefined_bob> the engine is not documented
[03:20:47] <undefined_bob> and very llimited
[03:21:07] <Cork> your sure this is a javascript lib?
[03:21:20] <eoli3n> hi
[03:21:22] <Cork> never seen a template js engine using xml markup
[03:21:46] <eoli3n> i want to add a class to a string so i followed -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14241917/jquery-add-class-in-a-variable-containig-html-string
[03:21:47] <undefined_bob> I'm not. the template engine is a cms
[03:21:58] <eoli3n> as -> https://ptpb.pw/BbNY
[03:22:05] <Cork> ah, ya asp?
[03:22:08] <eoli3n> but jquery cry when line = $(preline);
[03:22:42] <Cork> eoli3n: please create a jsfiddle.net with the example you're trying to make
[03:23:42] <undefined_bob> I dont think its js based. the cms used its own proprietary language called CCML
[03:24:59] <Cork> ya, ugg it doesn't look fun...
[03:27:21] <Cork> the syntax makes it really really hard to search for too, as search engines strip out ::
[03:27:49] <Cork> anyway as it happens server side you can't fix this in js if you want it compliant
[03:28:05] <Cork> so either you have to find what methods you have available in the template or just leave it as it is
[03:28:39] <Cork> well or you could define an id property for each element instead of using the text
[03:28:41] <Cork> but.. ya
[03:31:04] <eoli3n> Cork: https://ptpb.pw/Gi7O
[03:31:06] <eoli3n> fixed
[03:31:33] <eoli3n> creating jsfiddle fixed my issue :)
[03:31:47] <Cork> and is why i usually request it
[03:32:05] <Cork> ppl tend to figure out the problem if they are forced to think it through to ask the question
[03:32:48] <Cork> eoli3n: btw you can simplify that quite a bit with toggleClass('class', check)
[03:33:37] <Cork> eoli3n: also don't append in a loop (if you do) cause that will kill performance
[03:34:05] <eoli3n> what is the difference between toggleClass and addClass in my example ?
[03:34:33] <eoli3n> i need to append on data
[03:35:20] <eoli3n> Cork: my question is more : "how toggleClass can simplify ?"
[03:36:14] <Cork> eoli3n: line.toggleClass('green', preline.indexOf("ok:") !== -1).toggleClass('orange', preline.indexOf("changed:") !== -1 || preline.indexOf("included:") !== -1) and so on
[03:36:29] <Cork> that removes the need for the if cases
[03:37:06] <eoli3n> oh cool, exactly what i needed !!
[03:37:08] <eoli3n> thx a lot
[03:38:34] <Cork> eoli3n: also preline.indexOf("changed:") !== -1 || preline.indexOf("included:") !== -1)
[03:38:58] <Cork> can be replaced with preline.match(/(changed|included):/) != null
[03:39:56] <eoli3n> thx again !! :)
[03:39:58] <eoli3n> <3
[03:40:10] <Cork> eoli3n: and findally i would prob avoid doing this as html
[03:40:21] <Cork> it can mean things could be xss injected in the page
[03:40:33] <eoli3n> hm so doing it where ?
[03:40:34] <Cork> better to create dom elements and set the .text() like
[03:40:39] <Cork> all of it is :)
[03:40:52] <eoli3n> i think i don't get what you mean
[03:41:33] <Cork> content = '<a></a><span>' + preline +  '</span>' <-- will execute scripts tags if they are in the log for example
[03:42:20] <Cork> MUCH better to do line = $('<div>'); line.append('<a>').append($('<span>', { text: preline });
[03:42:27] <eoli3n> ahhh
[03:42:29] <Cork> as that doesn't parse preline as html
[03:42:31] <eoli3n> ok get it
[03:42:37] <eoli3n> thx
[03:42:39] <eoli3n> !
[03:43:09] <Cork> (btw content isn't defined)
[03:43:19] <Cork> so it is a global
[03:45:45] <eoli3n> you mean with var content
[03:45:46] <eoli3n> ok
[03:45:58] <Cork> though with the change i suggested you won't need content :)
[03:46:05] <eoli3n> yep
[03:46:07] <eoli3n> just did
[03:46:10] <eoli3n> :)
[03:50:17] <eoli3n> Cork: https://ptpb.pw/4-fg
[03:50:20] <eoli3n> done
[03:50:22] <eoli3n> :)
[03:50:24] <eoli3n> thx a lot
[03:50:34] <eoli3n> oups
[03:50:37] <eoli3n> forget a shitty line
[03:50:56] <eoli3n> better -> https://ptpb.pw/ZOvI
[03:51:01] <Cork> eoli3n: i would just move the second to last line to line 3
[03:51:29] <Cork> line = $('div').append('<a>').append($('<span>', { text: preline }),
[03:51:31] <eoli3n> insert a blank line at 2 ?
[03:52:11] <Cork> opps i misread what you had at the top
[03:52:20] <eoli3n> yeap, that was strange
[03:52:44] <Cork> so just replace all of it with: var line = $('div', { class: 'log-line' }).append('<a>').append($('<span>', { text: preline });
[03:53:19] <Cork> then you just need the toggleClasses and $('#code').append(line)
[03:53:20] <eoli3n> will toggleClass understand that it should toggleClass on div ?
[03:53:34] <eoli3n> not on a or span
[03:53:35] <Cork> as line is the div
[03:53:37] <Cork> yes
[03:53:40] <eoli3n> ok
[03:53:42] <eoli3n> cool :)
[03:53:55] <Cork> a and span is children of the div element that line is pointing to
[03:54:30] <Cork> and... i keep messing up the append line...
[03:54:39] <Cork> var line = $('div', { class: 'log-line' }).append('<a>').append($('<span>', { text: preline }));
[03:54:41] <Cork> there
[03:54:45] <Cork> that will even parse :)
[03:54:46] <eoli3n> ok, that's great factoring... left only 8 lines huhu
[03:55:14] <Cork> (missed the last ) )
[03:55:22] <eoli3n> ah
[03:55:24] <eoli3n> ok
[04:03:10] <eoli3n> something is not working... hm
[04:03:16] <eoli3n> no errors, strange
[04:03:55] <Cork> (create a running jsfiddle.net and i could help much easier)
[04:04:48] <eoli3n> yep
[04:05:04] <undefined_bob> re
[04:05:21] <undefined_bob> boss wanted an update of the current state of the page lol
[04:05:52] <undefined_bob> I do not think I can fix it in the cms without restricting the user input which wouldnt work. But maybe you are right and I can define an other option for the id value
[04:06:28] <undefined_bob> but what argues against the script which clean the id and href values? I think this coud work
[04:10:34] <eoli3n> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/m5ugesz5/
[04:11:48] <Cork> ugg japp it is me typoing again
[04:11:52] <Cork> div != <div> >_<'
[04:12:08] <Cork> eoli3n: https://jsfiddle.net/m5ugesz5/2/
[04:12:44] <eoli3n> oh !
[04:12:51] <eoli3n> didn't see it too
[04:12:53] <eoli3n> thx :)
[04:13:14] <eoli3n> working again
[04:55:15] <jiremeke> Hi.
[04:55:44] <jiremeke> My CSS isn't applieded ramdomly to loaded element.
[04:56:03] <jiremeke> So the browser use the default style instead of the stylesheet rules.
[04:56:13] <jiremeke> Some one know how to solve this issue ?
[04:58:33] <Cork> jiremeke: can you reproduce it so in a jsfiddle or something like that?
[04:59:00] <Cork> only thing i can think of is that the selector stops matching for some reason
[04:59:42] <jiremeke> I don't know how to reproduce beacause it's very ramdom.
[05:00:03] <jiremeke> I don't show any space or blank in chrome web console.
[05:00:25] <jiremeke> It only show that the browseragent stylesheet is used for the element
[05:00:34] <Cork> only recommendation i can give is try inspecting the element when it doesn't get styled
[05:00:54] <jiremeke> If I force reloading css before the jquery load, the stylesheet is correctly applied.
[05:00:58] <Cork> also does this happen when the page is loaded or when the content is modified with scripts?
[05:01:21] <jiremeke> this append only when loading html with jquery.
[05:01:34] <jiremeke> on normal loading of content, the style is OK.
[05:01:38] <Cork> are you loading full html or just a fragment?
[05:02:17] <Cork> cause if you load a full page with header and expect styles in there to be used
[05:02:43] <Cork> you have a problem cause you can't load extra headers so jquery uses dom error parsing to throw away everything outside the body if you do
[05:03:03] <jiremeke> just the needded fragment, no headers
[05:03:04] <Cork> the solution is to have the styles you need always loaded
[05:03:29] <Cork> then check what stylesheets you have loaded and make sure what you need is there and the selectors match the element
[05:04:03] <Cork> css is stateless so you can't really get it not matching unless those two cases are causing the problem
[05:06:28] <jiremeke> the loaded css is right. All rules was applied if it was reloaded after jquery.load() function.
[05:06:47] <jiremeke> so the selector match elements
[05:07:10] <Cork> uh your assuming a lot there
[05:07:42] <Cork> use the dev tools to check what stylesheets are loaded, make sure they contain what you expect them to
[05:08:04] <Cork> and run something like $('the selector') and make sure the new element is matched
[05:08:27] <jiremeke> In dev tools, all needed css is present.
[05:08:33] <jiremeke> Content is also right.
[05:08:36] <Cork> also make sure the dom structure you've loaded has the correct structure
[05:09:29] <jiremeke> I have to wait for produce again this bug... and I will so check again that the element is matched
[05:09:40] <jiremeke> thanks for this fist ways.
[05:40:23] <eoli3n> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/m5ugesz5/3/
[05:40:29] <eoli3n> i want to create a span by word
[05:40:38] <eoli3n> i don't understand why it isn't working
[05:41:12] <Cork> data is undefined
[05:41:18] <eoli3n> oups
[05:41:33] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/m5ugesz5/4/
[05:42:46] <eoli3n> still undefined
[05:42:49] <eoli3n> wtf
[05:43:44] <Cork> eoli3n: https://jsfiddle.net/m5ugesz5/5/
[05:43:52] <eoli3n> just did the same i think :)
[05:43:55] <eoli3n> it works
[05:44:11] <eoli3n> wow
[05:45:10] <eoli3n> hm
[05:45:19] <eoli3n> problem is that i want to word.toggleClass('green',
[05:45:44] <Cork> based on what?
[05:45:50] <eoli3n> that's the problem
[05:45:52] <eoli3n> just a sec
[05:46:01] <eoli3n> i want to be able to hilight words and strings
[05:46:05] <eoli3n> based on match
[05:46:10] <eoli3n> exact match for words
[05:46:15] <Cork> that is easy enough
[05:46:20] <eoli3n> lets try
[05:46:57] <eoli3n> but i need to do it outside map
[05:47:07] <Cork> why?
[05:47:07] <eoli3n> and then i don't have access to word
[05:47:19] <eoli3n> Cork: because this file will be compiled from a yaml file
[05:47:29] <Cork> ok?
[05:47:31] <Cork> and?
[05:47:59] <eoli3n> and if i add toggleClass in function
[05:48:09] <eoli3n> why is there isn't any word hilight to doo
[05:48:12] <eoli3n> what
[05:48:14] <eoli3n> if there
[05:48:22] <Cork> it wouldn't be highlighted?
[05:48:29] <eoli3n> function will broke ?
[05:48:31] <Cork> isn't that the point?
[05:48:32] <Cork> no
[05:48:38] <eoli3n> hm lets tru
[05:48:40] <eoli3n> y
[05:49:15] <Cork> also word is line i just realized
[05:49:26] <eoli3n> what ?
[05:49:34] <Cork> you split()
[05:49:37] <eoli3n> yep
[05:49:39] <eoli3n> so ?
[05:49:40] <Cork> not split(' ') or something
[05:49:52] <eoli3n> ah
[05:49:53] <Cork> split() doesn't really do anything so not sure what you're trying to do
[05:49:54] <eoli3n> ok
[05:49:59] <eoli3n> thx :)
[05:51:11] <Cork> anyway https://jsfiddle.net/m5ugesz5/7/
[05:51:47] <eoli3n> yep
[05:51:52] <eoli3n> but hard to generate from a yaml file
[05:52:08] <Cork> your generating js from yaml??
[05:52:19] <eoli3n> i will, with handlebars
[05:52:25] <Cork> ugg
[05:52:39] <eoli3n> poblem is that that file is client side
[05:52:44] <eoli3n> and yml is server side
[05:52:51] <eoli3n> problem
[05:52:55] <Cork> so you don
[05:53:10] <Cork> *'t have any js files in your project it is all yml converted to js?
[05:53:24] <eoli3n> nop, just this one will be converted
[05:53:26] <eoli3n> from a conf file
[05:53:41] <Cork> why not just have the conf file contain the regex rules and the rest be static js?
[05:54:00] <eoli3n> Cork: https://ptpb.pw/2vyd
[05:54:07] <Cork> that is how one normally would do things like that
[05:54:20] <eoli3n> that's what i want to do
[05:54:30] <Cork> uh that is the data not the script
[05:54:33] <eoli3n> but how to serve correct matching rules to client.js ?
[05:54:51] <eoli3n> it is, i didn't write the script to parse it yet
[05:54:55] <Cork> i would just do a convertion of yml to json
[05:55:03] <Cork> and just push that to the client as a config
[05:55:13] <eoli3n> oh... good idea
[05:55:34] <Cork> then just have js do new regexp(highligh[0].string)
[05:55:35] <eoli3n> another problem
[05:55:46] <eoli3n> nop, this is not a problem
[06:02:17] <hellyeah> why i didnt center my ui dialog to the page https://jsfiddle.net/0z55a2m5/3/
[06:03:46] <Cork> hellyeah: what do you mean?
[06:04:01] <Cork> it is height then the body so it can't center in that direction
[06:06:23] <eoli3n> Cork: socket.io can query a file ?
[06:06:29] <hellyeah> center of the page
[06:06:37] <hellyeah> i mean center of x and y
[06:06:43] <Cork> hellyeah: it is
[06:06:58] <Cork> if you ask why it isn't escaping the iframe; the answer is it can't
[06:07:07] <hellyeah> hm in my work it is not centered?
[06:07:16] <hellyeah> i cannot put dialog to the center?
[06:07:20] <Cork> it is in the jsfiddle so...
[06:07:38] <hellyeah> ah
[06:07:42] <hellyeah> i see
[06:10:57] <eoli3n> Cork: i will use css(), else i should declare color in css file
[06:11:03] <eoli3n> and using sass or something like that
[06:11:12] <eoli3n> that was my first idea ^^
[06:11:17] <Cork> i would recommend the later ya
[06:11:28] <eoli3n> use sass ?
[06:11:30] <Cork> i tend to avoid using .css if possible
[06:11:48] <eoli3n> hm, but it's better to read my json file then apply only .css() ?
[06:11:55] <Cork> eoli3n: i would recommend using a class for the look, how you define it is up to you
[06:12:13] <Cork> eoli3n: possibly, but then you have nothing to identify them with
[06:12:24] <eoli3n> there is a problem
[06:12:29] <eoli3n> in my yaml file
[06:12:34] <eoli3n> color has no idea
[06:12:42] <eoli3n> so in css how to set a class
[06:12:46] <eoli3n> without any name
[06:12:51] <Cork> ya, i would have a set of classes instead of rgb colors
[06:13:02] <Cork> and then one can pick colors based on those classes
[06:13:05] <eoli3n> less flexibility
[06:13:16] <Cork> sure, but does it need to be that flexible?
[06:13:18] <eoli3n> but maybe you're right
[06:13:23] <eoli3n> not really
[06:13:36] <Cork> i know i'm a bit stuck up about really not liking inline styles
[06:13:38] <eoli3n> and user will be able to add new class to match
[06:13:46] <eoli3n> directly in style.css if he wants to
[06:14:04] <Cork> but ya you can use .css('color', highlight[0].color) if you like
[06:14:10] <Cork> it isn't really anything "wrong" with it
[06:14:16] <Cork> you have no toggle for that though
[06:14:29] <eoli3n> nahh i get it, i want probably it to be too flexible
[06:14:35] <eoli3n> too much
[06:14:47] <eoli3n> declare 10 colors in css is good
[06:15:00] <eoli3n> then i will be able to tweek this by sass theming
[06:15:04] <eoli3n> if i want
[06:20:57] <eoli3n> Cork: another thing -> https://ptpb.pw/pGkn
[06:21:04] <eoli3n> i need cmd: to be dynamic in nodeJS
[06:21:51] <eoli3n> i mean if something match in line listen to a res.params.<match>
[06:21:55] <eoli3n> as $target
[06:22:05] <eoli3n> but match it with "$target" seems a bad idea
[06:22:43] <eoli3n> i want to add cmd:ssh root@{}\n  args: target
[06:24:32] <eoli3n> or maybe i should directly use template syntax -> cmd: ssh root@{{target}}
[07:05:10] <Cork> eoli3n: not sure what your asking there
[07:15:24] <hellyeah> this syntax is correct             $('.iDColumn').append('<td class= level ' + classid + '>' + element.ID + ' data-opt="ID"' +  'data-field="updatablefieldDC' + classid + '</td>');
[07:15:54] <hellyeah> no
[07:17:48] <Cork> create an element instead of that html mess...
[07:18:21] <Cork> $('td', { class:'', data: { opt: '', field: '' } })
[07:18:24] <Cork> opps
[07:18:26] <Cork> $('<td>', { class:'', data: { opt: '', field: '' } })
[07:18:30] <hellyeah> i think it is correct now $('.iDColumn').append('<td class= level ' + classid + 'data-opt="ID"' + 'data-field="updatablefieldDC' + classid + '>' + element.ID + 'data-opt="ID"' +  'data-field="updatablefieldDC' + classid + '</td>');
[07:18:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:18:56] <Cork> and no that isn't valid either
[07:18:58] <hellyeah> Cork,  keep that in my mind
[07:19:04] <Cork> 1. class= level isn't valid
[07:19:19] <Cork> data-opt="ID"dat-field="updatefieldDC" isn't valid
[07:19:21] <Cork> and so on
[07:19:22] <hellyeah> why?
[07:19:30] <hellyeah> hm
[07:19:41] <Cork> and that is why that solution is so bad
[07:19:53] <Cork> it is extreamly easy to typo something
[07:19:59] <Cork> and it is horrible to read
[07:20:02] <hellyeah> right
[07:20:18] <Cork> (and not to mention the xss problem)
[07:20:28] <hellyeah> can you tell me what is my typo here? i dont have time to fix that right away
[07:20:33] <hellyeah> what do you mean xss problem
[07:20:45] <Cork> not without typing it out without all the concatination
[07:20:51] <Cork> as like i just said, it is horrible to read
[07:21:04] <Cork> just don't go that way, there are easy ways to do it cleanly
[07:21:10] <Cork> (and i just gave it to you)
[07:21:48] <hellyeah> data-field
[07:21:52] <hellyeah> let me check
[07:22:25] <Cork> i meant the $('<td>', {}) solution
[07:22:37] <Cork> write readable code
[07:23:10] <hellyeah> i see that
[07:23:18] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:28:59] <hellyeah> Cork,  this one is okey?             $('.iDColumn').append('<td, {class: level ' + classid +','+"data :{opt : ID, field:updatablefieldDC'" + classid +'}'+ '>' + element.ID + '</td>');
[07:29:09] <Cork> no
[07:29:20] <Cork> append($('<td>', {}))
[07:29:25] <Cork> not {} in the string
[07:29:35] <hellyeah> so i need $
[07:29:40] <hellyeah> and i am ok right
[07:29:45] <Cork> you need to append an element not a string
[07:29:59] <hellyeah> right
[07:30:05] <hellyeah> thats correct
[07:30:40] <hellyeah> so             $('.iDColumn').append($('<td, {class: level ' + classid +','+"data :{opt : ID, field:updatablefieldDC'" + classid +'}'+ '>' + element.ID + '</td>')); everything is good now
[07:30:50] <Cork> man read what i typed
[07:30:57] <Cork> and no that isn't even close to correct
[07:31:39] <hellyeah> oops
[07:32:41] <AdamPDotty> Is iDColumn pyramid case?
[07:33:55] <hellyeah> sorry asking again
[07:34:02] <hellyeah> is this correct now             $('.iDColumn').append($('<td>', {class: 'level  + classid' , data :{opt : 'ID', field:'updatablefieldDC'+ classid } + '>' + element.ID + '</td>'));
[07:34:10] <hellyeah> what do you mean pyramid case?
[07:34:20] <Cork> hellyeah: does  'level  + classid' really look correct to you??
[07:34:31] <Cork> read your code -_-'
[07:34:36] <hellyeah> D
[07:34:36] <hellyeah> 4
[07:34:50] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:35:19] <hellyeah> i guess it is okey now
[07:35:48] <hellyeah> $('.iDColumn').append($('<td>', {class: 'level'  + classid , data :{opt : 'ID', field:'updatablefieldDC'+ classid } + '>' + element.ID + '</td>'));
[07:36:27] <hellyeah> wrong again
[07:36:29] <hellyeah> ?_
[07:36:29] <b-ot> ?underscore
[07:36:38] <hellyeah> :D
[07:36:42] <hellyeah> jquery has bot
[07:36:46] <hellyeah> :DŞ_
[07:37:00] <thykka> ?_
[07:37:00] <b-ot> ?underscore
[07:37:04] <thykka> ?+
[07:37:07] <thykka> ?-
[07:37:11] <thykka> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:37:30] <hellyeah> hope it works
[07:41:14] <hellyeah> i am confused
[07:43:49] <Cork> hellyeah: you are still keeping all the html klonk
[07:44:23] <hellyeah> i dont know what klonk means
[07:44:23] <Cork> its just $('<td>', { class: '', data: {}, text: '' }) no close tag or end tag
[07:44:43] <Cork> just add the attribute values and text content
[07:44:56] <Cork> and yes if you need more complex structures use a template
[07:45:33] <Cork> hellyeah: your still building html in the last example you posted back, all you need is the values for the attributes not the html
[07:46:04] <Cork> though that said you are getting closer :/
[07:48:10] <hellyeah> so  $('<td>', { class: 'level' + classid, data: { opt: 'ID', optvalue='element', field: 'updatablefieldDC' + classid}, text: '' })
[07:48:21] <Cork> optvalue=
[07:48:27] <Cork> no = in objects
[07:48:30] <hellyeah> ops
[07:48:36] <hellyeah> i am so tired
[07:48:39] <hellyeah> :D
[07:49:04] <Cork> honnestly run the line in a console and fix the errors the parser throws
[07:50:13] <hellyeah> i guess not it is ok ('<td>', { class: 'level' + classid, data: { opt: 'ID', optvalue: element, field: 'updatablefieldDC' + classid }, text: element.ID })
[07:50:33] <hellyeah> right?
[07:51:25] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/ncpLxLtn/
[07:56:37] <hellyeah> $('.iDColumn').append($('<td>', { class: 'level' + classid, data: { opt: 'ID', optvalue: element, field: 'updatablefieldDC' + classid }, text: element.ID })), why it doesnt work
[07:57:01] <Cork> define doesn't work
[07:57:38] <hellyeah> i just checked developer tools
[07:58:07] <hellyeah> i just see <td class="level0">6</td>
[07:58:15] <hellyeah> there is no data information
[07:58:22] <hellyeah> or data information is hidden?
[07:58:51] <Cork> $('td').data
[07:58:54] <Cork> opps
[07:58:55] <Cork> $('td').data()
[07:59:01] <Cork> its in the data property
[07:59:12] <hellyeah> why it is not visible on dom?
[07:59:20] <Cork> if you specifically need data prefixed attributes use 'data-opt': ''
[07:59:31] <Cork> hellyeah: cause that is what data: map to
[07:59:36] <hellyeah> ah
[08:00:16] <hellyeah> okay
[08:01:12] <hellyeah> good
[08:02:34] <hellyeah> i fix this now http://dpaste.com/3EE2QWY great
[08:03:00] <hellyeah> life is better than ever
[08:03:03] <hellyeah> right
[08:23:30] <eoli3n> 115452          Cork   i would just do a convertion of yml to json
[08:23:31] <eoli3n> 115501          Cork   and just push that to the client as a config
[08:23:40] <eoli3n> how to push to the client ?
[08:24:08] <eoli3n> with socket.io 'message' ?
[08:24:12] <Cork> you could puts it as window.config = json; in a script or a separate .js file
[08:24:16] <Cork> or ya load it through ajax
[08:24:22] <Cork> depends on what works best for what you need
[08:25:14] <eoli3n> i don't get the window.config part
[08:25:45] <Cork> eoli3n: window.clientConfig = { highligh: ... };
[08:26:01] <eoli3n> yep but how to push from srv to client
[08:26:24] <Cork> you could ex do <script></script> tags in the html or have the server generate a js
[08:26:24] <eoli3n> yml file is server side
[08:26:42] <eoli3n> ah so how i said before with handlebars
[08:26:45] <hellyeah> is this correct $('.' + $class).closest('.idColumnMon').find('td[class='+$class+']')
[08:27:08] <Cork> eoli3n: kinda except in this case it is just a plain object, not functions
[08:27:20] <Cork> (aka json()
[08:27:51] <eoli3n> yep
[08:27:59] <eoli3n> i get it now, lets try
[08:28:00] <Levin^> good morning
[08:28:02] <eoli3n> thx a lot <3
[08:29:32] <undefined_bob> how can I make the selector $('a').each(function() to target only <a> within a <div> which either have one or an other specific class?
[08:30:42] <AdamPDotty> $('div').find('a.one, a.other').each() ?
[08:31:26] <Cork> $('div.class1, div.class2').find('a') if i read the question correctly
[08:33:14] <undefined_bob> the div is like <div class="generic_class"><div class="specific_class"><a id="myid" and so on
[08:33:38] <Cork> so you want it inside both?
[08:34:03] <Cork> $('.generic_class > .specific_class > a') would work then
[08:34:10] <Levin^> for some reason my slider is duplicating the images and the arrows
[08:34:11] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/releases/impulsionada-pelo-evento/
[08:34:35] <Levin^> my js file: http://34.234.87.242/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js?ver=4.8.4
[08:34:36] <undefined_bob> no the generic class is not important and should be ignored. I try to targer the id insinde the <a> of the specific_class div
[08:35:02] <Cork> s/slider/slideshow/
[08:35:02] <b-ot> Correction, <Levin^> for some reason my slideshow is duplicating the images and the arrows
[08:35:04] <Levin^> lines 109 and 152
[08:36:15] <Cork> undefined_bob: id is unique you don't need a class selector
[08:36:24] <Cork> undefined_bob: if the id isn't unique you shouldn't be using id=""
[08:36:36] <Levin^> b-ot: do you know how to solve that?
[08:36:38] <undefined_bob> it is unique
[08:36:57] <Cork> undefined_bob: then just target the id, why isn't that enough?
[08:37:30] <Cork> or did you mean you want to grab the id from the a inside that class?
[08:37:50] <Cork> aka $('.specific_class a').attr('id')
[08:38:32] <undefined_bob> basically its still for this script: https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/VyyQVw  I want to prevent the script from targeting the wrong <a>
[08:39:03] <Cork> "the wrong <a>"?
[08:39:31] <undefined_bob> and I thought modifying the selector to target only the <a> within the div which have the class I need, would be good
[08:39:57] <undefined_bob> yes, there are more <a> tags in the code which shouldnt be affected by the script
[08:40:44] <undefined_bob> or is my thinking wrong/too complicated?
[08:45:56] <Cork> undefined_bob: but didn't we land on that you didn't need the strip thing this morning?
[08:46:46] <Cork> and if not i would prob just do something like $('a[href="#"]')
[08:46:51] <Cork> opps
[08:46:57] <Cork> * and if not i would prob just do something like $('a[href^="#"]')
[08:47:38] <undefined_bob> yes but then we saw that the the url doesnt look nice with all the %20 and stuff and that I would still need to URI_encode the href
[08:48:44] <Cork> btw what is the .filter function suppose to do?
[08:49:57] <undefined_bob> hm
[08:52:44] <undefined_bob> it create an array with all elements that pass a test
[09:00:51] <undefined_bob> I think the $('a[href^="#"]') is still too broad
[09:01:23] <undefined_bob> but the  $('.generic_class > .specific_class > a') work
[09:02:24] <undefined_bob> is it possible to add a second specific class to that? I tried  $('.generic_class > .specific_class, specific_class2 > a') but then it didnt work anymore
[09:22:33] <Cork> undefined_bob: you missed the . in the second selector; but yes that should work
[09:24:34] <undefined_bob> thanks
[09:27:30] <undefined_bob> it should be like an OR. like select the <a> when either specific_class1 OR specific_class2 is in the <div>
[09:28:47] <AdamPDotty> class is not "in" a div
[09:30:15] <AdamPDotty> The operator , combines two results, so it is technically an "and", but the result should be what you wanted to achieve.
[09:31:53] <Xatenev> hi
[09:32:04] <Xatenev> is it possible to catch net::ERR_ACCESS_DENIED in a jquery ajax call (standard xhr call even)?
[09:32:25] <Cork> Xatenev: you can get notified, you can't block it no
[09:32:36] <Xatenev> Cork, I want to get notified
[09:32:43] <Xatenev> Cork, actually I want to know if that happens and display a message to the user
[09:32:49] <Xatenev> like: fix your stuff
[09:33:03] <Cork> just grab the .fail() callback
[09:33:49] <Cork> some network info isn't exposed in xhr, and those errors you can't access at all
[09:34:26] <Cork> ERR_ACCESS_DENIED is 406 as far as i know so it shouldn't be a problem
[09:34:27] <Xatenev> Cork, and thne?
[09:34:35] <Cork> then you're screwed :P
[09:34:50] <Cork> they fail without an info of why
[09:34:50] <Xatenev> I just see that statusText is is error
[09:34:55] <Cork> i think status code is 0
[09:35:04] <Xatenev> yea
[09:35:08] <Xatenev> status is 0
[09:35:13] <Xatenev> so I can't know why it failed?
[09:35:18] <Cork> nope
[09:35:22] <Xatenev> fuck
[09:35:23] <Xatenev> that
[09:35:23] <Xatenev> :D
[09:35:30] <Cork> that would make the user exposed to sniffing
[09:35:50] <Cork> remember browsers are user agents not site owner agents :)
[09:36:38] <Xatenev> =(
[09:36:41] <Xatenev> thanks for the help
[09:37:42] <undefined_bob> AdamPDotty if I add the , .specific_class2 it doesnt work https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/VyyQVw
[09:38:34] <Cork> undefined_bob: .balken > .balkenclosed selects the div, not a
[09:39:18] <Cork> i suspect you want $('.balkenclosed > a, .balkenopen > a')
[09:39:41] <undefined_bob> I have it like this $('.balken > .balkenclosed, .balkenopen > a')
[09:39:58] <Cork> ya and the first selector selects the div not the a
[09:40:13] <Cork> .balken is a div and .balkenclosed is a div
[09:40:22] <undefined_bob>  $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a') works but  $('.balken > .balkenclosed, .balkenopen > a') not
[09:40:24] <undefined_bob> yes
[09:40:33] <undefined_bob> they are both div
[09:40:36] <Cork> ya cause you changed what you select
[09:40:56] <Cork> $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a')
[09:41:03] <Cork> $('.balken > .balkenclosed, .balkenopen > a')
[09:41:10] <Cork> you select different things
[09:41:47] <undefined_bob> both div have the same class .balken. one div have .balken .balkenclosed and the other have .balken .balkenopen
[09:41:51] <Cork> $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a, .balken > .balkenopen > a') would select both opend and closed with the requirement it has the .balken parent
[09:41:58] <Cork> though i'm not sure you need that precision
[09:42:11] <Cork> $('.balkenclosed > a, .balkenopen > a') should be enough
[09:42:21] <Cork> (as .balken is in the class already)
[09:43:30] <undefined_bob> nice, thank you. that works on both
[09:43:34] <undefined_bob> :)
[09:43:44] <undefined_bob> I have to understand that
[09:43:46] <Cork> undefined_bob: do you understand why the other one didn't work?
[09:44:51] <Cork> you can rewrite $('.balken > .balkenclosed, .balkenopen > a') as $('.balken > .balkenclosed').add($('.balkenopen > a')) that might make it a bit more clear
[09:45:10] <Cork> (though the second version is heavier to run so don't use that in production)
[09:46:41] <undefined_bob> so the script is first looking for .balken then for .balkenclosed and then for .balkenopen too? which it cant find beause it doesnt exist that way?
[09:47:37] <Cork> no
[09:47:43] <Cork> selectors doesn't work like that
[09:48:25] <undefined_bob> and the precision version looks for .balken with .balkenclosed and/or .balken with .balkenopen?
[09:48:33] <Cork> '.balken > .balkenclosed' means 1. find the element with the class balkenclosed, 2. only keep elements with a parent with the class balken
[09:48:44] <Cork> it is one query from the point of js
[09:48:58] <Cork> this is the same for how css works
[09:49:28] <Cork> comma in css means you add another selector that can also match
[09:49:30] <undefined_bob> I admit I have the same struggle with selectors in css and js
[09:49:49] <Cork> so a,div means "and element of type a or div" for example
[09:49:52] <undefined_bob> its so confusing
[09:50:05] <Cork> and element = an element
[09:50:33] <Cork> undefined_bob: think of comma as a separate query that is later merged
[09:50:55] <Cork> it does not modify the first query it is just two result sets
[09:51:04] <undefined_bob> and the > select the childs of the parent class, which is here .balken?
[09:51:22] <Cork> > is the same as space except it has to be a direct parent
[09:51:53] <Cork> so <div class="balken"><span><div class="balkenopen"> wouldn't select it
[09:52:09] <Cork> but ".balken .balkenopen" would
[09:52:50] <Xatenev> Cork, is status always 0 if its client error?
[09:52:52] <Xatenev> in xhr call?
[09:53:16] <Cork> if i remember correctly jquery set it to 0 if it can't find one
[09:53:25] <Cork> so javascript exceptions has 0 as status
[09:53:38] <Xatenev> mhm thats good I rhink
[09:53:41] <Xatenev> think
[09:53:41] <Cork> but it was a while since i last dealt with that
[09:54:10] <undefined_bob> so instead of  $('.balken > .balkenclosed, .balkenopen > a') I could also write  $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a')  $('.balken > .balkenopen > a') ?
[09:54:25] <Cork> undefined_bob: and then merge the two results ya
[09:54:39] <Cork> it means more work for the browser though
[09:54:41] <undefined_bob> yes
[09:55:00] <Cork> but it might make it easier to understand what it means in the selector
[09:55:10] <Cork> oh wait
[09:55:25] <Cork> you used the old broken selector
[09:55:32] <Cork>  $('.balken > .balkenclosed, .balkenopen > a') could be written as
[09:55:44] <Cork>  $('.balken > .balkenclosed') $('.balkenopen > a')
[09:55:50] <Cork> not $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a')  $('.balken > .balkenopen > a')
[09:56:08] <undefined_bob> why no need to add .balken to the second?
[09:56:31] <Cork> no, there is, but it isn't in the combined selector
[09:56:50] <Cork> --> , .balkenopen > a') <--
[09:57:06] <Cork> hence why i called it broken
[09:57:17] <undefined_bob> ah okay
[09:57:28] <Cork> $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a, .balken > .balkenopen > a')
[09:57:33] <Cork> would be the same as $('.balken > .balkenclosed > a')  $('.balken > .balkenopen > a')
[09:57:45] <undefined_bob> ya thats what I meant
[09:58:19] <undefined_bob> that makes it more clear
[10:21:18] <eoli3n> oupsss my jsfiddle
[10:21:21] <eoli3n> is buggggggy
[10:22:44] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/p411qwtn/2/

[10:27:39] <Levin^> hi, this is an accordion I'm making: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/govzBQ
[10:28:29] <Levin^> sorry, this is the correct link: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PERWYP
[10:29:19] <Levin^> I need to make each input with an unique ID (adding a number should be enough)
[10:29:24] <taplar> Levin^: small note "jQuery(function($) {" is a document ready
[10:29:51] <undefined_bob> oh hello taplar
[10:29:57] <taplar> morning!
[10:30:09] <undefined_bob> good evening
[10:30:12] <Woet> Levin^: why are you reinventing the wheel? and why in such a hackish way?
[10:30:39] <Levin^> Woet: yes, I am indeed, but it's needed for my site
[10:30:44] <undefined_bob> thanks for your help yesterday, taplar
[10:30:58] <Levin^> because I can't insert HTML from where it comes
[10:31:11] * taplar eyes undefined_bob as if he has completely forgotten yesterday
[10:31:33] <Levin^> so I am inserting my own HTML through jquery
[10:31:52] <undefined_bob> I haven't forgotten you :)
[10:31:57] <Woet> Levin^: why can't you insert HTML?
[10:32:05] <taplar> now you're going to make me look at the logs
[10:32:15] <undefined_bob> and look, the script is growing https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/VyyQVw
[10:32:27] <taplar> ah, the id thing
[10:32:36] <undefined_bob> yes
[10:32:47] <Levin^> Woet: it's a long story, but my website is wordpress and the piece of code I'm manipulating comes from a plugin
[10:32:57] <eoli3n> thx taplar !
[10:32:59] <Woet> Levin^: so change the code
[10:33:02] <taplar> eoli3n: np
[10:33:10] <Levin^> Woet: can't you help me with my issue?
[10:33:44] <undefined_bob> right now I'm trying to figure out how to tell the script it should replace special chars like äöü with ae oe ue
[10:34:01] <Levin^> I just need to serialize the input ID...
[10:34:19] <Levin^> and my code is done
[10:34:31] <Xatenev> Levin^, what do you wanna do? didnt get it yet
[10:34:37] <taplar> Levin^: did you see my comment about the document ready?
[10:34:44] <Levin^> taplar: yes, thanks
[10:34:50] <Xatenev> Levin^, I see this accordion but no input fields
[10:35:00] <taplar> $('<input type="radio" name="tabs2">').attr("id", "tab"),  <-- and why are you using attr there?
[10:35:06] <Levin^> Xatenev: the input fields are being inserted via jquery
[10:35:28] <Levin^> taplar: for no special reason, actually
[10:35:33] <Woet> Levin^: my advice is best practices, not hackish solutions
[10:35:38] <Levin^> I thought I could manipulate it better that way
[10:35:42] <taplar> so why didn't you use attr for type and radio?
[10:35:55] <Levin^> I could
[10:37:53] <taplar> also you can't repeat ids like that
[10:38:08] <taplar> you're putting a label before multiple things, that reference the same id
[10:39:34] <taplar> since you are hiding the input you really don't even need that id on the radio
[10:39:44] <taplar> a radio inside a label will toggle with the click of the radio, without a relation
[10:39:52] <taplar> the parent/child relation joins them
[10:41:29] <xinobi> Hi, I need to integrate some spreadsheet plugin with tinymce or ckeditor any ideas?
[10:42:20] <taplar> i didn't think tinymce was a jquery thing
[10:43:22] <taplar> Levin^: also your radio button doesn't have a value, so I'm not sure what you
[10:43:27] <taplar> 're expecting to serialize
[10:45:15] <undefined_bob> see you guys tomorrow
[10:47:53] <Levin^> taplar: I want to serialize an ID, like id="tab-1", "tab-2", etc
[10:48:08] <taplar> why not a value?
[10:48:25] <taplar> which is how serialize is expected to work
[10:48:52] <Levin^> I will make a label for="tab-1" next
[10:49:11] <Levin^> that label will be the visible text on each item of the accordion
[10:50:30] <Levin^> the radio makes the accordion to open and to close when clicked on another item
[10:52:34] <taplar> so you need to loop over the tab sections, and put the label and radio before each of them with a unique id
[10:59:15] <Levin^> how do I tell it to be an unique id?
[11:00:15] <taplar> the each() method can accept in the index as part of it's arguments
[11:05:36] <Levin^> ok
[12:16:56] <rjCousineau> hi i'm trying to use $.inarray('needle',['haystack']) and when nothing is found, it returns -1.  Boolean(-1) returns true;  I'm not sure how to evaluate this function in an if statement
[12:17:24] <taplar_lunch> > -1
[12:17:45] <rjCousineau> I guess I could != -1
[12:17:53] <taplar_lunch> sure
[12:17:57] <AdamPDotty> > -1
[12:18:01] <rjCousineau> oh I didnt see your >
[12:18:05] <AdamPDotty> heh
[12:18:07] <rjCousineau> heh
[12:18:09] <rjCousineau> ty
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:17:31] <taplar> indeed
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> how you doing, taplar?
[13:21:46] <taplar> so so, still slowly ripping out code from the app, :)

[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> humm.  and I'm alright.  Been a busy few weeks.  Things are starting to ramp up around here with some changes in the org.
[13:29:53] <Levin^> hello
[13:30:13] <Levin^> I finally made my code loop lol
[13:30:32] <Levin^> but for some reason it's duplicating itself
[13:30:35] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PERWYP
[13:30:44] <Levin^> what did I do wrong?
[13:31:05] <robertmaxrees> which part is duplicating?
[13:31:05] <Levin^> it's displaying the same content three times
[13:31:30] <Levin^> <div class="tab blue">...</div>
[13:31:33] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> because you have three var $tabSelector = $(".tab-content");
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> and you're appending to each of them, every time you do insertBefore
[13:32:36] <Levin^> I need some time to think that hmm
[13:32:41] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> so instead of $tabSelector, you want to insertBefore the CURRENT $tabSelector, right?
[13:33:02] <Levin^> yes
[13:33:26] <robertmaxrees> so how do you ge the current element in an each?
[13:33:48] <Levin^> current...
[13:34:12] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> check out that opening paragraph
[13:35:43] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ make sense?
[13:36:06] <robertmaxrees> you particularly want to pay attention to "More importantly, the callback is fired in the context of the current DOM element, so the keyword this refers to the element."
[13:36:31] <Levin^> hehe it's $this
[13:36:40] <Levin^> I mean, $(this)
[13:36:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[13:36:54] <Levin^> thanks
[13:36:55] <Levin^> yes
[13:37:08] <Levin^> I had this question for a while
[13:37:33] <robertmaxrees> see why it wasn't working the way you expected before?
[13:37:39] <Levin^> because I already tried to loop other stuff, but always ended up on duplicated stuff
[13:38:00] <Levin^> it was like running the code inside the code
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[13:38:19] <Levin^> no?
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> dunno what you mean by that.
[13:39:03] <Levin^> was I calling the each function inside the each function?
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> .insertBefore does an implicit each as apart of its code.
[13:41:00] <Levin^> hm
[13:50:55] <taplar> why are you trying to change the value of i?
[13:55:58] <bilb_ono> can someone help explain whats happening when I do var $form = $(this); here https://bpaste.net/show/70edab77a165
[13:56:29] <bilb_ono> this is someones code, I cannot log $(this) or $form on lines 6 and 7, it just throws an internal server error
[13:56:41] <taplar> it's creating a local variable of the jQuery object created that contains the form element
[13:56:42] <bilb_ono> why can’t I log these and whats happening on line 5 ?
[13:57:01] <bilb_ono> taplar: whats in the jquery object?
[13:57:15] <bilb_ono> so its like a json thing? with everything submitted in the form?
[13:57:18] <taplar> the form
[13:57:30] <taplar> 'this' inside the event handler is the element the event handler is bound to
[13:57:35] <bilb_ono> taplar: do you know why it might not log to the console?
[13:57:57] <taplar> not given what you have
[13:58:03] <taplar> can you reproduce the error in a fiddle?
[13:58:09] <bilb_ono> Ill try
[13:58:25] <taplar> g Array.prototype.slice
[13:58:32] <taplar> hmm
[13:59:54] <Levin^> yaay my code works
[13:59:57] <Levin^> I feel happy
[14:02:33] <taplar> thought 'https://js.stripe.com/v3/' doesn't look like a jquery file
[14:03:31] <taplar> thought line 3 would blow up if jquery wasn't included some where i'd think
[14:32:11] <WillPittenger> Is there a way to call getBoundingClientRect from a JQuery object?
[14:32:48] <bilb_ono> arg all my jsfiddles work but my raw code never does
[14:32:56] <bilb_ono> speicifically e.preventDefault();
[14:33:04] <WillPittenger> It'd be a snap if I could access the DOM object.
[14:33:34] <taplar> you can get the dom element via [index] or .get(index)
[14:33:47] <bilb_ono> is this the right order to put everything in? https://bpaste.net/show/83367e8caf17
[14:34:07] <bilb_ono> I made this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/62xnbmof/ which works perfectly of course
[14:34:33] <taplar> order looks fine
[14:34:40] <bilb_ono> but my code in that paste just submitts immediately despite e.preventDefault, e.stopImmediatePropagation, doesn’t log either error and of course doesn’t alert anything
[14:34:54] <WillPittenger> taplar: The objects in a JQuery array are the DOM elements?
[14:35:03] <taplar> yep
[14:35:05] <WillPittenger> I thought they'd be the JQuery version.
[14:35:13] <taplar> there isn't a jQuery dom element
[14:35:33] <taplar> the jQuery object is just an object that contains dom elements, and has methods associated with it
[14:36:01] <taplar> for instance if you do something like $(document.body)
[14:36:14] <taplar> all that does is creates a new jQuery object, and puts the body as the single element in it's stack
[14:36:46] <WillPittenger> OK.  Thanks.
[15:22:41] <taplar> an image response from awkwardCough to my question to the group like 5 minutes ago.  https://giphy.com/embed/xULW8wYl6oOpNpCmha
[15:22:44] <taplar> kills me

[16:00:17] <taplar> i really wanted to find a picture of boss baby with his hands together that I could caption with "so.... you think your funny."
[17:38:30] <bilb_ono> how do you find the data-key elements in a form? here https://jsfiddle.net/62xnbmof/1/ I want to log the form element that I input
[17:38:57] <bilb_ono> when I submit, it gives me a huge form object, but I can’t find the text I input before pressing OK!
[17:40:41] <taplar> what do you mean "find" the data-key?
[17:44:37] <bilb_ono> taplar: so you see how I put data-test="number" .. I was hoping that when I submitted the form. I could log for instance form.number and it would be the text that I input to that field.
[17:45:35] <taplar> you'd have to find that input by it's data field
[17:45:53] <taplar> are you going to be doing ajax with it?
[17:47:00] <bilb_ono> yeah
[17:48:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/62xnbmof/2/  is the selection of the field
[17:48:33] <taplar> i selected on input first cause thats a quick getElementsByTagName
[17:49:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/62xnbmof/3/  added a name to the field and then you can access it on the form
[17:50:16] <taplar> various ways to skin the cat
[17:50:48] <bilb_ono> taplar: ok thanks. this is very helpful for learning
[17:51:00] <taplar> bilb_ono++
