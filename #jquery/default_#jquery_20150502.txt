[01:17:12] <krambiorix> hi, with dropzonejs , how can i remove the dropzone from the element?
[02:12:01] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/9Ymvt/3514/ is it right you can call directive only one time
[02:13:44] <cyberbrai> how much time i can call the directive
[02:19:30] <cobradabest> I'm not sure if I'm in the fight place, but can someone tell me how to detect a button click on jQuery mobile? Nothing I've tried so far works...
[02:19:35] <cobradabest> *right
[02:20:20] <cyberbrai> any help on angular js
[02:20:37] <arthurvr> cyberbrai: #angularjs :)
[02:21:12] <cyberbrai> arthurvr i tried but no answer since yesterday
[02:21:40] <arthurvr> cyberbrai: that’s no reason to ask question that aren’t related to jQuery in here ;)
[02:22:05] <cobradabest> Can someone help me with my problem?
[02:22:18] <cyberbrai> arthurvr actually i thought someone work on angularjs
[02:23:22] <arthurvr> yes, many people here, but angularjs questions aren’t interesting for the majority of people in here. You’re also more likely to get an answer in an appropriate channel.
[02:23:33] <cyberbrai> cccoooooolll
[02:23:54] <cobradabest> How do you detect a button press in jQuery?
[02:24:07] <arthurvr> `click @ cobradabest
[02:24:15] <arthurvr> `api click @ cobradabest
[02:24:15] <b-ot> cobradabest: .click(): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[02:24:28] <arthurvr> cobradabest: check that api page :)
[02:24:59] <cobradabest> I've tried that, but it doesn't seem to work...
[02:25:14] <arthurvr> then you’ll need to create a fiddle/jsbin, cobradabest
[02:25:46] <cobradabest> What's that?
[02:26:05] <arthurvr> google it :) Handy playground to build reduced testcases.
[02:26:18] <arthurvr> It’s handy for us to repro and like that we can try to provide you a solution
[02:26:50] <arthurvr> using a *reduced* testcase there we are sure the problem isn’t unrelated.
[02:26:51] <cobradabest> Oh, is this like pastebin?
[02:27:17] <arthurvr> no, not really. You paste things on pastebin, jsfiddle/bin are to build reduced testcases :)
[02:27:35] <arthurvr> http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions last paragraph
[02:30:10] <cobradabest> Okay, I found a few errors in my js file, and I fixed them, but the problem still persists...
[02:30:40] <arthurvr> cobradabest: as I said try to make a reduced testcase on jsfiddle, we can’t help this way ;)
[02:31:05] <cobradabest> SO do I share what I have, then?
[02:31:18] <arthurvr> yes please :)
[02:31:38] <cobradabest> http://jsbin.com/rozawowohi/1/
[02:32:52] <cobradabest> So do you know what I'm doing wrong?
[02:32:59] <arthurvr> let me take a look
[02:33:07] <arthurvr> Uncaught TypeError: $.jGFeed is not a function
[02:33:18] <arthurvr> so that’s the first thing going wrong :D
[02:33:40] <cobradabest> Ah, I was told that referred to something, what would I replace it with?
[02:34:11] <arthurvr> I don’t get you, you will need to define jGFeed or include the plugin in your page.
[02:34:44] <cobradabest> Oh yeah, how do I refer to "JGFeed.js"? Do I simply use "("JGFeed")"?
[02:34:57] <arthurvr> Just use a <script> tag lol
[02:35:11] <cobradabest> On a js file?
[02:36:46] <arthurvr> cobradabest: no, it’s just a script you need (I guess?) so just like every other plugin just include a script tag in your html
[02:40:18] <cobradabest> Okay, I've been talking to the person I'm working on this project with, and he says that it's referring to another script.
[02:40:55] <arthurvr> yes, of course it does :D You’ll just need to include that script in your HTML, the same way as you included every other script.
[02:41:05] <cobradabest> Oh right, I did.
[02:42:15] <cobradabest> Oh, it's not the right case, it should've been "jGFeed", but it's "jGfeed" instead, would that make a difference?
[02:42:40] <arthurvr> cobradabest: variables in javascript are case sensitive so yes
[02:42:48] <cobradabest> I fixed it, and I don't see any difference.
[02:43:14] <arthurvr> cobradabest: you didn’t fix anything
[02:43:24] <arthurvr> there’s no js/ folder on jsbin
[02:43:28] <cobradabest> I know.
[02:43:33] <arthurvr> check the console before asking stuff lol :D
[02:43:46] <arthurvr> so you’ll first need to properly link it up :)
[02:43:48] <cobradabest> I fixed it on my actual project, and I still saw no difference...
[02:44:08] <arthurvr> again I can’t help if you don’t build up a reduced testcase
[02:44:22] <arthurvr> by the way don’t expect that to fix the actual problem
[02:44:28] <arthurvr> it’s just one of the problems :)
[02:44:46] <cobradabest> Sorry if I'm being a nuisance, but how exactly do I build a reduced testcase?
[02:44:46] <arthurvr> ”<arthurvr>: so that’s the first thing going wrong :D”
[02:45:12] <arthurvr> https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[02:45:19] <cobradabest> Hold on, I'm getting an error in the console when I click the button.
[02:46:02] <arthurvr> cobradabest: yup, as I said that was only the first buggish thingy
[02:46:19] <cobradabest> Can you see the console, or do you want me to send a pastebin?
[02:46:56] <arthurvr> I’m not going to help you out if you don’t build a reduced testcase (it’s kind of a channel rule). I should be able to see the exact same console as you :)
[02:47:15] <cobradabest> Oh, okay, I'll try and make a reduced testcase, then.
[02:48:26] <cobradabest> How do I make the html refer to the javascript file on jsbin?
[02:49:27] <arthurvr> refer to external libraries using a CDN or host the files yourself. Also, if you *reduce* your page enough you wouldn’t need any external libs except jQuery and jQm.
[02:49:49] <sergez> arthurvr: yo
[02:49:56] <sergez> has been long since I spoke to you
[02:50:05] <arthurvr> changing nicks?
[02:50:08] <sergez> yuupppp
[02:51:38] <sergez> how are you?
[02:51:45] <arthurvr> I’m fine bro
[02:51:56] <sergez> do I disturb?
[02:52:08] <unka> hi, why does my attempt at subclassing not work as intended? https://jsfiddle.net/xqo2ef26/
[02:52:14] <arthurvr> nope - just going through some open source stuff
[02:52:16] <arthurvr> sergez: ^
[02:52:32] <arthurvr> unka: let me take a look
[02:52:46] <cobradabest> arthurvr: I think I have created a reduced test case,
[02:53:21] <arthurvr> unka: take a look at your console :) The `new` keyword has a capital `N`
[02:53:36] <arthurvr> cobradabest: link?
[02:53:55] <cobradabest> http://jsbin.com/rozawowohi/2/
[02:53:57] <unka> arthurvr: if you change New to new, it still doesnt work
[02:54:26] <arthurvr> unka: yes, but that’s just a bug in your code, I first told you to fix the syntax error :)
[02:55:17] <arthurvr> unka: second thing: carColor console.logs something and you console.Log it again on line 18.
[02:55:59] <bepolite> lol unka you amaze me
[02:56:10] <arthurvr> bepolite: with?
[02:56:13] <cobradabest> arthurvr: No, wait, I'm getting an error, I'll try to fix it.
[02:57:05] <arthurvr> bepolite: by the way, awesome list :)
[02:57:15] <cobradabest> arthurvr: okay, it should be alright now, so how do I go about fixing my problem?
[02:57:27] <bepolite> Thanks arthurvr
[02:58:31] <arthurvr> cobradabest: still 3 errors in the console :) 404’ing files :)
[02:59:00] <cobradabest> Where did you see that?
[02:59:14] <arthurvr> in the jsbin’s console
[02:59:31] <cobradabest> When I click the button?
[02:59:39] <arthurvr> no just right off
[02:59:50] <arthurvr> and 1 comes when clicking
[03:00:04] <cobradabest> I'm not getting anything, except for when I click...
[03:00:32] <sergez> cobradabest: I'm seeing 3 :)
[03:00:48] <cobradabest> Can you C+P them or explain them?
[03:01:01] <sergez> arthurvr: I never understand how you stay working through these issues man
[03:01:23] <sergez> now only one anymore: Uncaught TypeError: $.getNewFeed is not a function
[03:01:37] <cobradabest> Oh right.
[03:01:57] <cobradabest> How about now?
[03:02:14] <cobradabest> Hold on, I'm getting the error now.
[03:03:00] <cobradabest> It's saying "undefined is not a function"... what does that mean?
[03:03:24] <cobradabest> Does that mean I'm referring to a non-existent function?
[03:03:28] <arthurvr> cobradabest: yup
[03:05:28] <cobradabest> I can't see where I went wrong...
[03:10:35] <cobradabest> What have I done wrong?
[03:11:19] <sergez> cobradabest: check your console and you'll magically figure it out :)
[03:11:34] <sergez> should be the first thing to do when coming to this channel by the way
[03:11:53] <cobradabest> Sorry, this is my first time, I'll remember that in the future, though.
[03:14:50] <cobradabest> It looks like it's pointing to "$.extend" in the function "getNewFeed($)", is $ not meant to be used here?
[03:17:51] <cobradabest> Okay, I don't seem to be getting errors anymore, but the feed still isn't showing anything...
[03:18:48] <cobradabest> Anybody still here?
[03:19:27] <sash_> Can I use the valaues of a <select><option> element directly in the browser using css or jquery? I want to toggle the visibility of some elements dependent on the selected value.
[03:23:01] <hedin_> Hello! How can I make smiley with jquery, or some jquery plugin?
[03:24:54] <cobradabest> I'll just deal with my issue later, how can I check if a string contains a certain word?
[03:25:54] <rmorrin> Is there any benefit to use .on vs .bind or vice-versa for attaching event handlers?
[03:26:31] <Oka> .on() is preferred, more flexible in nature.
[03:29:03] <rmorrin> Oka, thank you :)
[03:31:34] <Oka> sash_: Using .val() on a select element will get the value of the selected option.
[03:44:06] <sash_> Oka: Cool, this is going to help me. Just in case, do you know of a css only solution?
[03:45:04] <Oka> sash_: Maybe... let me tinker. It would be very hacky if possible
[03:56:54] <sash_> Oka: Don't bother, I solved it using val(), thank you very much
[03:57:14] <Oka> sash_: Cool cool, was about to let you know it's not possible with the select in pure css anyway
[03:57:24] <Oka> doable with radio buttons, or checkboxes though
[03:57:28] <sash_> :D Thanks, good to know
[03:57:47] <sash_> Yes, they have active states. Or selected, I dont't exactly remember.
[03:57:55] <Oka> :checked, yeah
[03:58:08] <Oka> it's more about the nesting of the option elements
[03:58:13] <sash_> That was ist.
[03:58:42] <Oka> value never gets set directly on the select element, and the option elements are nested so they can't target stuff outside
[04:41:00] <norc> Hi. Why is ajaxStart a global event?
[04:42:02] <norc> I would like to have an event to bind to to set loading spinners whenever an ajax request begins, but the semantics of ajaxStart make it hard to use that event.
[05:05:18] <norc> Ah well, guess I can just fire my own custom event everytime I want to start an ajax call.
[05:26:10] <new_pornographer> the css property should be movig my divs around at run time right?
[05:46:09] <frank_o> Hello! At the accepted answer at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10024469/whats-the-best-way-to-retry-an-ajax-request-on-failure-using-jquery - what is the purpose of the two returns used inside the timeout error code?
[05:52:36] <frank_o> doug16k: why the huge numbers in your nick? ;)
[06:04:49] <ashgotti> Good morning. I have a complicated form with nested fieldsets. I want to select the top most fieldset of an element but when I do $(this).closest('fieldset').last(); it grabs all of them..
[06:05:34] <ashgotti> I see on stackexchange that's what most people recommend: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11305643/how-to-style-top-parent-element-using-jquery
[06:07:17] <ashgotti> wait, i'm dumb
[06:07:53] <ashgotti> of course .text is going to grab all the text contained in that fieldset *facepalm
[06:18:50] <ashgotti> New question: I'm creating a table of contents to show all my inputs on a page. I've created it but want to have multilevel lists with the parent fieldset/table text as the parent item. I've managed to append that value to the link but don't know how to make it the level 2 list item and the child items as level 3: http://jsfiddle.net/thpyezhL/
[06:19:01] <ashgotti> I know I'll ahve to do a <ul> but don't know how to put it in my code
[06:26:48] <sepoki> Hello, i am new to web development and wish to know if it is possible to write a file using only jquery, or something in client side.
[06:27:57] <TheHackOps> sepoki, Yes it is
[06:28:09] <TheHackOps> sepoki, How ever I dont see why you would want to do this
[06:29:22] <sepoki> because it's a college job
[06:29:57] <TheHackOps> sepoki, You can control the entire pages DOM
[06:30:08] <TheHackOps> How ever this is a very horrible approach to web development
[06:30:19] <TheHackOps> jQuery should be used to support and enhance your page
[06:30:21] <TheHackOps> Not build it
[06:30:31] <TheHackOps> Unless you're doing dynamic DOM rendering
[06:30:41] <sepoki> Actually i want to build a xml document
[06:30:51] <TheHackOps> sepoki, XHTML?
[06:30:53] <TheHackOps> or
[06:30:55] <TheHackOps> actual XML
[06:31:30] <sepoki> is there any paper that could i read ?
[06:31:49] <sepoki> xml
[06:33:02] <TheHackOps> sepoki, http://jsxml.net/
[06:33:06] <TheHackOps> This might help you
[06:34:21] <sepoki> thank u
[06:59:46] <sepoki> TheHackOps: I must have expressed myself wrong, I need to write in an external XML file
[07:18:43] <argoneus> hello
[07:18:49] <argoneus> is there a way to catch what a user is trying to write to a textarea, replace it with something else, and then put it in?
[07:19:01] <argoneus> like if he writes "a" it will write "A" instead, etc. this seems to be more annoying to solve than I thought it would
[07:54:35] <arthurvr> argoneus: give me 10 minutes and I’ll show you something :)
[08:03:06] <drej> kinky
[08:06:29] <arthurvr> argoneus: little example that might help you http://jsbin.com/rowamiwoki/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:06:58] <arthurvr> although I don’t know it seems irritating for a user
[08:27:27] <bewilled> Ok, so I'm using jQuery Mobile and doing manual ajax page transitions with the following code history.pushState(null, null, link); jqm.mobile.changePage( link, { transition: "fade", changeHash: false }); Each page has a bunch of images as more page transitions are done (more clicking around the app) the app starts getting slower. I take a heap snapshot after each page transition and the heap is about 2 MB bigger. What am I missing here for the correct
[08:27:28] <bewilled> implementation of manual page transitions. Could someone point me out how page transitions are handled when ajaxEnabled=true in jqm code?
[10:17:26] <Glaisher> I want to select some checkboxes if the label for it is in a certain CSS class. How do I do it?
[10:48:32] <nikio_> hey all
[10:48:38] <nikio_> why is this not working?
[10:48:39] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/JamesD/TFTvn/15/
[10:53:14] <ExtraSteve> I'm using the jquery ui tabs plugin. Is there a way I can have someone click a link on a differnet page and land on my tabs page on say #tab2 - without the browser automatically scrolling down to my tabs window? I want the user to land at the TOP of the page - just with #tab2 open
[10:53:16] <ExtraSteve> If that makes sense
[10:55:13] <ExtraSteve> Or rather, the #tabs2 anchor always drags the user down to the div where all of my tabs are. I'd like the user to land at the top of the page instead.
[10:57:01] <Azrael_-> hi
[10:57:03] <Azrael_-> how can i show the type of an object with an alert?
[10:57:37] <nikio_> s

[11:16:38] <Kriss> Hi guys, look out my webpage at http://www.kristjanrobam.16mb.com and please give me feedback, if you have time! Thanks.
[11:18:51] <Ldip> Anyone have any experience with Redactor? Trying to modify the video plugin to include a wrapping div and no matter what I do it doesn’t work.
[11:21:48] <Ldip> Nevermind! Thanks Googler.
[11:33:19] <amitkumartana> good morning everyone
[11:34:03] <amitkumartana> difference between appen and append To
[11:34:17] <amitkumartana> sry append or append To
[11:35:13] <amitkumartana> any help on it i know it's  basic question but i use both and seem no different
[11:36:35] <bepolite> amitkumartana: the semantics are different
[11:36:48] <bepolite> They do different things
[11:37:04] <bepolite> ?api apend apendTO @ amitkumartana
[11:37:43] <amitkumartana> bepolite yup i am newbie so when i use i got no diif between sematics
[11:37:49] <amitkumartana> so they wok diif
[11:44:11] <bepolite> ?api append
[11:44:11] <b-ot> bepolite: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:44:19] <bepolite> ?api appendTo
[11:44:20] <b-ot> bepolite: .appendTo(): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[11:44:29] <Crucials> amitkumartana: the difference is the subject
[11:44:56] <Crucials> div1.appendTo(div2); makes div1 the child
[11:45:04] <Crucials> div2.append(div2) makes div2 the child
[11:45:20] <Crucials> kind of the same, but you might prefer one or the other when chaining methods
[11:46:17] <Crucials> that second one was supposed to be div1.append(div2)
[11:52:57] <Crucials> nikio_: http://jsfiddle.net/TFTvn/668/
[11:56:23] <nikio_> thx Crucials already did it differently
[11:56:44] <Crucials> yeah im sure there are plenty of ways to get it done
[11:58:01] <kingfisher64> hello. how could others advise a designer to learn jquery? I have not learned javascript although have some experience with manipulating scripts. I'm finding that I desperatly need to use the language
[11:59:43] <Crucials> kingfisher64: have you done any programming before?
[12:05:50] <kingfisher64> I understand concepts in php Crucials like variables, loops etc. I'm not entirely new to jquery but I really need to dedicate some serious learning to get good at it
[12:06:39] <Crucials> concepts like variables, loops etc are just general programming concepts. I would suggest giving this a go: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[12:06:45] <Crucials> or at least use it as a reference
[12:07:19] <Crucials> if you dont want to just read and go through examples, the best way I would say is - just make a website and hack at it until it does what you want and you'll learn
[12:07:49] <Crucials> spend lots of time reading the jquery api and use that ebook, and generally everything has already been answered on stackoverflow
[12:09:06] <rcyr> kingfisher64: The problem here is that you can't be good at jquery without 1) understanding the basics of javascript 3) understanding asynchronicity in JS 2) understanding the basics of the DOM like event bubbling, event delegation 4) Understanding complex CSS selectors, to efficiently do node selections using jQuery
[12:09:25] <rcyr> (i kind of switched 2 and 3.. but whatever :P)
[12:13:47] <kingfisher64> okay thanks Crucials. I've been manipulating scripts for years (basic ones anyway) but I'd love to be able to write and especially adapt scripts into Drupal.
[12:17:02] <kingfisher64> like now I'm stuck trying to debug something probably simple but have no idea (as there are no firebug console errors)
[14:25:13] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:25:13] <Azrael_-> does $("#myform").submit(); trigger a normal sending as if the user clicked onto a submit-button or is it done in the background? currently it seems like nothing is sent.
[14:27:39] <bepolite> It triggers a normal submit
[14:27:47] <bepolite> Azrael_-: ^^
[14:28:02] <Azrael_-> but it doesn't work right now
[14:28:27] <bepolite> Azrael_-: Show us the code
[14:28:28] <bepolite> Fiddle?
[14:28:45] <Azrael_-> ok, will try to strip it down
[14:28:58] <bepolite> nice
[14:35:41] <Azrael_-> http://jsfiddle.net/rnn4pztz/ <-- doesn't seem to work in jsfiddle
[14:38:03] <rcyr> Azrael_-: NEVER have a submit button with the same "submit"
[14:38:06] <rcyr> s/same/name
[14:38:36] <rcyr> That's what causes your problem.
[14:38:39] <Azrael_-> sorry, don't really understand what you mean
[14:38:52] <rcyr> This line: 		<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Speichern">
[14:39:01] <rcyr> See the      name="submit"    part?
[14:39:04] <rcyr> Never do that.
[14:39:26] <rcyr> It conflicts with an old DOM feature
[14:40:13] <rcyr> If you use anything but "submit" as the name, it will work.
[14:40:39] <tw2113> good to know, as a bystandard to the issue at hand
[14:40:54] <Azrael_-> great thanks, never thought this could cause it :)
[14:40:57] <Azrael_-> works now
[14:41:07] <rcyr> Azrael_-: I got bitten once... I'll never forget.
[14:42:52] <Azrael_-> i'm going crazy...... everything i try works just fine with any modern browser, just the old proprietary one i want to support fails everywhere. unfortunately no debugging tools available for it. tried to add firebug lite but didn't see any output. any suggestions?
[14:43:03] <rcyr> Basically, an old feature of the DOM makes it possible to get a node from a form by name using the following syntax  myForm[theNameOfTheControl]
[14:43:15] <rcyr> Guess what happens when the "name" is submit?
[14:43:33] <rcyr> It conflicts with the "submit" function that is on the form dom element
[14:43:50] <Azrael_-> interesting, thanks for the good explanation to understand it
[14:44:06] <rcyr> So jQuery tries to call submit of the DOM element but instead of a function... it gets a DOM node.
[14:49:09] <veverak> hi folks
[14:49:17] <veverak> is there some way to instead of stoping the animation
[14:49:20] <veverak> just change it's target ?
[14:49:40] <veverak> more like
[14:50:01] <veverak> I've got animate() that scrolls page to next 'item' and when I pres key (which triggers it) it goes there quite nicely
[14:50:16] <veverak> but when I press key again before it ends... it stops and than moves to item after that
[14:50:20] <veverak> that stopping looks not so nice :/

[14:52:29] <JohnDow> Ajax success call not firing up even if i have 200 ok
[14:52:31] <JohnDow> http://www.hastebin.com/atexerasuz.coffee
[14:53:30] <rcyr> JohnDow: Then add an error handler and see what happens
[14:54:20] <JohnDow> with complete it's working tho
[14:54:43] <rcyr> complete... executes even when it fails.
[14:54:58] <rcyr> So.. add a error handlers, console.log it
[14:56:07] <JohnDow> new to jquery, been so long with php. how do i add error handler?
[14:59:41] <JohnDow> i did error: function(req, err){ console.log('my message' + err); } and it return's my json which i expected
[15:00:05] <rcyr> You did it right
[15:00:11] <rcyr> What is the status code sent by the server?
[15:00:27] <JohnDow> 200 ok
[15:00:35] <JohnDow> it's working opposite way
[15:00:49] <rcyr> Do you get any error in your javascript console?
[15:00:56] <JohnDow> none
[15:01:05] <Azrael_-> ok, fixed my error by substituting "confirm" as it wasn't supported
[15:01:07] <rcyr> o_O That's strange.
[15:01:37] <JohnDow> i pasted my hastebin code here. did you look at it already?
[15:02:12] <JohnDow> typeahead is working if i put the error: function(req, err){ console.log('my message' + err); }
[15:03:10] <rcyr> JohnDow: Yes, do you actually send json to the browser?
[15:03:20] <rcyr> (All the time?)
[15:03:46] <rcyr> (Looks like it... but I can't see the complete PHP file so there might be trailing spaces
[15:04:11] <JohnDow> the php side is only a simple select with like
[15:06:56] <JohnDow> demn, my ajax is working opposite way. I tried putting stuffs inside my success to the error and it work. Ironic
[15:06:59] <rcyr> JohnDow: An example of what I mean.... sometimes, people add ?> at the end of their PHP files and the added whitespace sometimes messes up JSON responses
[15:07:21] <rcyr> *mess
[15:07:41] <JohnDow> there's none i guarantee
[15:08:26] <rcyr> Hmm, perhaps you could add the proper Content-Type header but I'm pretty sure it works without
[15:13:19] <JohnDow> success: function(req, data){console.log('my message' + req)}
[15:13:25] <JohnDow> that said success
[15:13:54] <JohnDow> hmmm but the error wouldn't fire up now and the expected next thing to happen didn't happen
[15:30:49] <JohnDow> it worked now
[15:31:03] <JohnDow> just added one parameter to the success function
[15:31:05] <rcyr> What did you change?
[15:31:14] <rcyr> Hmm, ok
[15:31:16] <JohnDow> explanation why?
[15:31:23] <JohnDow> im a bit confused
[15:31:45] <rcyr> I am too, adding parameters to a function has no effect.
[15:32:01] <JohnDow> isn't it's supposed to work even if it's has one param only?
[15:32:11] <JohnDow> this is my first time experiencing this
[15:32:27] <JohnDow> so you mean, you have no clue too?
[15:32:28] <JohnDow> hahaha
[15:34:39] <rcyr> I don't.
[15:34:51] <rcyr> Adding a parameter in JS doesn't do much :/
[15:37:40] <JohnDow> demn, without changing anything. i tried to remove the first parameter again and it worked. I'm so clueless O.o
[15:37:42] <JohnDow> wth
[15:41:14] <rcyr> Caching issues?
[15:41:54] <JohnDow> nope
[15:42:22] <JohnDow> is this considered a bug? or wat? it just feel so weird
[16:02:41] <stangeland> Hi, if i have this in my ready function: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10973849/ is that what is called a closure?
[16:03:45] <rcyr> stangeland: In JS, "function" and "closure" can be pretty much used interchangeably
[16:04:30] <rcyr> stangeland: What you have there is just a "JS pattern", that one is called "Immediately-Invoked Function Expression" or IIFE
[16:04:44] <rcyr> (What's in the .ready function)
[16:05:14] <stangeland> rcyr, i see, so in that example i have there....this function inside the ready function is invoked immedietly as the document is ready=?
[16:05:22] <rcyr> Yes
[16:07:24] <stangeland> rcyr, i see....so whats the benefit of having it inside such a function? why not just have those codelines directly inside the ready function instead of having them inside this IIFE?
[16:08:22] <rcyr> stangeland: That specific snippets come from facebook and is going to be use on million of websites, without that IIFE, how would sure ensure that the "js" variable wouldn't conflict with something else?
[16:08:32] <rcyr> *snippet comes
[16:08:36] <rcyr> *used
[16:08:38] <rcyr> damn... can't write.
[16:09:23] <rcyr> The IIFE creates a "little box" that isolates the facebook code
[16:09:45] <stangeland> rcyr, but couldnt i just call it something else than js?
[16:10:27] <rcyr> stangeland: Sure... but how can you be certain that  it won't conflict with any of the million of websites that uses the snippet?
[16:10:35] <rcyr> No matter what name you pick
[16:11:24] <stangeland> rcyr, i dont think i understand how it can conflict with other websites? its being executed on my website no?
[16:11:40] <rcyr> stangeland: That snippet of code is given by facebook, right?
[16:11:50] <rcyr> It's the same snippet for every website in the world.
[16:12:14] <rcyr> How do you create a "snippet" that won't conflict in any way with all websites.
[16:12:31] <rcyr> How would you name the variables inside the function so they don't conflict?
[16:12:47] <rcyr> remember that this code can be pasted everywhere.
[16:13:57] <tw2113> keeping the var keyword with variable names keeps them out of the global scope
[16:14:23] <rcyr> The closure here acts as a double protection, it ensures that your code won't conflict with facebook's... and ensures that facebook's code won't conflict with your by overriding a js or fjs variable if you have one.
[16:14:28] <Crucials> from facebook's side its important to wrap it, in your case it probably doesnt matter but still "safer"
[16:14:35] <stangeland> rcyr, oh i see..... now i understand....from their point of view because they are sharing the snippet they are encapsulating it like that...but me...i know my website so i could just rename variables to something i know does not conflict with my site and then remove it from the little box if i wanted. is that right?
[16:14:45] <rcyr> stangeland: Exactly.
[16:15:06] <rcyr> stangeland: As long as you make sure that you're not having a js or fjs variable in the same scope.
[16:15:34] <rcyr> That snippet was written to be  "paste and forget", for non-programmers.
[16:15:50] <tw2113> which is more frequent than some people expect
[16:15:54] <stangeland> rcyr, so when code is encapsulated like that, how is it being used?
[16:16:17] <rcyr> stangeland: The(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk') part calls it.
[16:17:26] <stangeland> rcyr, aha yeah ok. and when i then in my code do eg. FB.init, where does the FB variable then come from?
[16:17:38] <stangeland> is that object somehow being downloaded?
[16:18:59] <rcyr> stangeland: That's exactly what your snippet does, it creates a script element, gives it the source of the facebook code and appends it to the DOM
[16:19:47] <rcyr> (in the <head>)
[16:20:06] <stangeland> aha i see
[16:20:29] <stangeland> so here: fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); the FB object is actually being created?
[16:21:08] <rcyr> No, that parts insert the dynamically created script node into the DOM
[16:21:17] <rcyr> *part
[16:21:27] <rcyr> *inserts.... FFS I suck
[16:21:48] <Crucials> the part that says d.createElement(s) is the creating part
[16:22:36] <stangeland> ahhh i see
[16:22:45] <rcyr> stangeland: Give me a second, I'll show you
[16:25:45] <rcyr> stangeland: http://jsfiddle.net/j610sq4g/
[16:26:04] <rcyr> Version with comments.... and a bit more readable so you can understand better what happens
[16:29:08] <stangeland> ahhhh now i understand... why couldn't i just instead put <script src=//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&appId=12345&version=v1.0"></script> in the html header ?
[16:29:42] <rcyr> stangeland: Doing that would block the page while it downloads the facebook code.
[16:29:53] <rcyr> Doing it dynamically doesn't block
[16:29:57] <stangeland> right ok
[16:30:11] <stangeland> that makes sense..and i guess its a lot to download?
[16:31:09] <rcyr> Even if it's not a lot...  would you like your website to become slow if facebook has issues?
[16:31:45] <rcyr> Let's say that facebook has problems with their CDN... and it takes 4 seconds to download that script.
[16:32:09] <rcyr> Doing it sync would mean that a large portion of the internet would be super slow.
[16:35:40] <stangeland> rcyr, right....i understand...hmmm i should be doing it dynamically with all CDN's then actually
[16:36:13] <rcyr> Well.. With third-party code
[16:36:46] <stangeland> right
[18:25:43] <NBhosting> is there a drageble that allows a scale factor
[20:04:31] <DragonPunch> Hey Uhkis you there?
[20:13:59] <DragonPunch> I have an event that is being fired twice after I have turned it off. Can anyone help?
[21:05:42] <Gitter> hello! i'm hoping to get some quick jQuery help.. I have a page that creates multiple file submission forms and I need to submit one based on the form changing. This all works fine but it only submits the first form and not the one that has changed. all the forms have the same class name which I'm using as the trigger in jQuery
[21:07:06] <oxguy3> are you doing like, $(".myclass").submit()?
[21:07:38] <oxguy3> if so, you might try something like $(".myclass").each(function(){ $(this).submit(); });
[21:08:04] <Gitter> $(".healthForms").change(function() {
[21:08:04] <Gitter>                 this.form.submit();
[21:08:04] <Gitter>             });
[21:08:25] <Gitter> huh... so just add an each?
[21:09:38] <oxguy3> oh wait, you just want to submit the form they edited? or you want to submit them all?
[21:09:53] <Gitter> just the one they edited
[21:10:06] <Gitter> sorry if i wasn't clear
[21:10:20] <oxguy3> are the .healthForms elements the INPUTs or the FORMs?
[21:10:21] <oxguy3> no worries
[21:11:09] <Gitter> i guess i could include an 'onchange="this.form.submit()"' to each form but i'd rather not repeat code liek that
[21:11:14] <Gitter> they're the inputs
[21:11:39] <oxguy3> you don't need to do that
[21:12:14] <Gitter> yeah that's what i hoped
[21:12:55] <oxguy3> hmm
[21:13:18] <oxguy3> maybe try $(this.form).submit()...?
[21:13:25] <Gitter> okay one sec
[21:13:29] <oxguy3> idk, im not sure why what you have wouldnt work
[21:14:31] <oxguy3> is your html definitely all correct where all your form tags close properly and stuff?
[21:15:04] <Gitter> i think so.. let me double check thouhg
[21:17:05] <Gitter> yeah each form is closed properly
[21:17:33] <oxguy3> hmm im not sure why that wouldnt work then :P
[21:17:56] <Gitter> <form method="POST" action="http://kims.app:8000/child/388/form" accept-charset="UTF-8" class="form-horizontal" enctype="multipart/form-data"><input name="_token" type="hidden" value="VwT2HBpT23GpfHptDYmzsA1yTRaKAHqQAnzIURuB">
[21:17:56] <Gitter>                                                         <label for="healthForms" style="cursor:pointer">Upload</label>
[21:17:56] <Gitter>                                                         <div class="hidden">
[21:17:56] <Gitter>                                                             <input class="hidden healthForms" name="healthForms" type="file" id="healthForms">
[21:17:56] <Gitter>                                                         </div>
[21:17:57] <Gitter>                                                     </form>
[21:18:24] <Gitter> :(
[21:18:35] <Gitter> i'm stumped
[21:19:39] <Gitter> it's also passing the uploaded file data to the first form and submitting it
[21:22:43] <oxguy3> where is it doing that
[21:23:30] <Gitter> i don't know. it's just happening
[21:23:36] <Gitter> ahhh!!! i fixed it!
[21:23:52] <Gitter> wait i think so at least hang on
[21:26:21] <oxguy3> haha alright :)
[21:29:59] <Gitter> yep!
[21:30:54] <Gitter> each form input name had to be unique despite them all being in different forms
[21:31:57] <Gitter> thanks so much for your help oxguy3
[21:33:43] <oxguy3> no prob! :) glad you got it working
[21:38:07] <Gitter> have a great day/night
