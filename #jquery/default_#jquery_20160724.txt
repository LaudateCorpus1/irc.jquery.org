[00:46:53] <Zeranoe_> How could I get the data from a div that has a specific "active" class?
[00:48:37] <Zeranoe_> I suppose $( ".active" ).data( "type" ) would probably get it?
[01:12:43] <Zeranoe_> So it would appear that if the selector in $( ".active" ).data( "type" ); finds more than one element, data( "type" ) will not look though the different elements?
[02:19:35] <Peppi> hello
[02:23:56] <Peppi> I'm using Cherrio so basically jQuery. I'm using it to scrape a website. Ive gotten as far as isolating this: https://nopaste.me/view/3d75d7fd from here I'm trying to scrape the website url any ideas how to do that?
[03:31:53] <shoky> Peppi: select it and get its "href" attribute?
[03:46:20] <acidjazz> wahts cherrio
[04:18:56] <shoky> https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio
[04:28:52] <acidjazz> why not just jquery?
[04:33:37] <shoky> if you're not in a browser, e.g. in node.js on the server
[04:34:37] <shoky> like when you're scraping a website, which is what they were doing ;p
[04:44:16] <acidjazz> oh i see
[04:44:17] <acidjazz> cool
[04:44:21] <acidjazz> you cant use jquery w/ node?
[04:44:21] <Peppi> yes
[04:44:25] <Peppi> got it figured out
[05:00:53] <shoky> acidjazz jquery requires a document, and node doesn't have a DOM, there are ways to get a "fake" DOM on it and use jquery that way cheerio is much lighter
[05:01:16] <shoky> *but cheerio is much lighter
[05:08:35] <acidjazz> i see
[05:08:51] <acidjazz> wow 80 contributors
[05:09:35] <acidjazz> woudl this be the recommended lib for scrapeing?
[05:09:53] <acidjazz> this looks cool
[05:09:54] <acidjazz> http://noodlejs.com/
[05:15:11] <shoky> never heard of it
[05:16:09] <shoky> cheerio is recommended for scraping i think yea, unless you need to scrape a site that requires interaction, then you might wanna use phantomjs or something like it or that wraps it
[05:16:19] <shoky> heard good things about nightmare.js
[05:40:51] <rarararara> how would i go about making this work; http://pastebin.com/AHeZBaCF  -- its like a while loop, should continue until b != null and give the response back to the original function that first called the Server.tryUntilResponse method ?
[05:42:20] <lulul> if i want to have a dropdown option a doctrine association field i need to use EntityType no ?
[06:16:31] <acidjazz> phantom looks cool
[09:44:33] <Themediator> Can someone please take a look and explain what I am doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/L29t1dzh/
[09:49:52] <Uhkis> Themediator: you don't have jquery in the fiddle and you're about to duplicate an id
[09:50:27] <Themediator> I want to duplicate the ID
[09:50:41] <Uhkis> that's not allowed
[14:41:33] <WhirledPress> if you have a grid of thumbnails and hidden popup content for each thumbnail. How do get the content to appear above the thumb and appear to grow from thumb size to full size?
[14:46:54] <shoky> position:absolute and css transition?
[14:47:23] <shoky> WhirledPress ^
[14:47:37] <WhirledPress> I'm having the hardest time getting it to work. The grid is in flexbox and the featured content doesn't want to light up with the thumbs
[14:48:05] <WhirledPress> im
[14:48:25] <shoky> shrugs.. i really need to properly learn flexbox some day
[14:48:36] <WhirledPress> I'll just start over. This is too much hassle to keep a train of thought through all this css bullshit. gawd I hate css.
[14:50:04] <WhirledPress> http://imgur.com/a/KLA4N
[14:50:25] <WhirledPress> didn't think it was going to be very difficult
[15:13:00] <naftilos76> What is the best way of checking with an if condition whether an element exists in the DOM? I am using this: if ($("#element_id").attr("id")){ // do something } .
[15:43:01] <mchelen2> i want to do simple table sorting, plus drag & drop. should i use a plugin for this, or is core jquery fine?
[15:44:17] <naftilos76> mchelen2, you probably need to find a lib for that. It depends on what exactly you wish to do.
[15:46:24] <naftilos76> mchelen2, this could help with the basics like .draggable() method. http://www.elated.com/articles/drag-and-drop-with-jquery-your-essential-guide/
[15:51:29] <z1haze> Im trying to learn requirejs but im following a tutorial thats saying to just have module.exports = require('./lodash'); directly in a public file without running it through browserify, etc... and im getting errors
[15:52:01] <z1haze> its just saying module is undefined
[17:08:16] <acidjazz> why cant i $.get and have it ask for Content-Type: 'application/json'
[17:08:27] <acidjazz> trying to set it w/ $.ajaxSetup
[17:12:23] <D-rex> acidjazz: $.get( "whatever.php", function( data ) {}, 'json');
[17:12:41] <acidjazz> D-rex: uhm ok
[17:12:43] <acidjazz> ill try that
[17:14:26] <acidjazz> how would i do that if im doing $.get('/').done()->fail();
[17:16:44] <acidjazz> also thats still sending text/html
[17:26:04] <acidjazz> is it not possible to chagne this??
[17:27:02] <acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/19f48728ca8d534b1cebbfb9d8274189
[17:29:55] <acidjazz> so if i specify ohter custom headers
[17:29:56] <acidjazz> those work
[17:29:58] <acidjazz> but its not overriding
[17:29:59] <acidjazz> text/html
[17:30:01] <acidjazz> hmmmmmm
[17:36:36] <D-rex> acidjazz: https://gist.github.com/cercos/0b1f8c8f8137dce230110783fe2ef7b1
[17:38:36] <acidjazz> i tried that as well
[17:38:38] <acidjazz> still sending text/html
[17:39:53] <D-rex> maybe it's responding in text/html?  and sending as json
[17:40:16] <acidjazz> ill show ya
[17:40:33] <acidjazz> http://imgur.com/a/bb4GF
[17:40:50] <acidjazz> so when iyou do dataType
[17:40:56] <acidjazz> it actually appends to the accept headers
[17:41:04] <acidjazz> but nothing ive tried will change Content-Type
[17:41:27] <D-rex> its your server side..your not repsonding with json
[17:41:37] <acidjazz> right because its text/html
[17:41:51] <acidjazz> using a chrome plugin i can change my content-type to application/json
[17:41:55] <acidjazz> and my server returns json
[17:42:47] <systemfault> acidjazz: What is your code?
[17:43:09] <systemfault> You must be doing something weird... jQuery makes it painful to send JSON, not to receive it.
[17:43:15] <acidjazz> the same gist i posted earlier systemfault , just adding d-rexs reco as well
[17:43:32] <acidjazz> my server sends html if its text/html, and json if its application/json
[17:43:36] <systemfault> acidjazz: Remove contentType
[17:43:41] <acidjazz> but even if thats broken im watching jquery do the
[17:43:41] <acidjazz> ok
[17:44:14] <systemfault> You don't need it if you specify dataType: 'json'... moreover, charset is not written properly.
[17:44:28] <acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/cd951c9fb4323a354022505fdff962e2
[17:44:29] <acidjazz> like that?
[17:44:30] <systemfault> REmove headers too
[17:44:37] <acidjazz> ok
[17:44:47] <acidjazz> just use the beforeSend?
[17:45:39] <systemfault> You shouldn't need beforeSend too
[17:45:47] <acidjazz> just dataTYpe ?
[17:45:49] <acidjazz> dataType* ?
[17:45:53] <systemfault> Yes.
[17:45:55] <acidjazz> i think dataType just cahnges the Accept headers
[17:45:58] <acidjazz> because i see those change
[17:46:03] <systemfault> Sure
[17:46:04] <acidjazz> but Content-Type stays at text/html
[17:46:13] <systemfault> That's how you ask the server to receive json
[17:46:17] <acidjazz> but actually i might just
[17:46:17] <acidjazz> yea
[17:46:25] <systemfault> accept == what you want from the server
[17:46:27] <acidjazz> ill change my server to judge via accept
[17:46:28] <acidjazz> right
[17:46:30] <systemfault> content-type is what you're sending.
[17:46:33] <systemfault> So...
[17:46:35] <acidjazz> ok so i was wrong to decide to use this in the 1st place
[17:46:40] <acidjazz> gotcha
[17:46:42] <acidjazz> easier too
[17:46:58] <systemfault> So you only want to receive json? Not send it?
[17:47:13] <acidjazz> i want to return json if i want json, and html if i want html
[17:47:28] <systemfault> From the server?
[17:47:33] <acidjazz> yes
[17:47:43] <systemfault> Using the client-side Accept header? If so, you got it, it's dataType
[17:47:51] <acidjazz> gotcha
[17:50:11] <acidjazz>     if (strpos($request->header('accept'),'application/json') !== false) {
[17:50:20] <acidjazz> works great
[17:50:28] <systemfault> Cool :)
[17:50:32] <acidjazz> reason being i use this debugbar to help w/ stuff
[17:50:49] <acidjazz> so now if i hit my endpoints w/ my browser, i actually render the json w/ a serverside json viewer
[17:51:37] <acidjazz> http://imgur.com/a/rwg5W
[17:51:55] <acidjazz> using this awesome tool https://github.com/yesmeck/jquery-jsonview
[17:52:19] <systemfault> That's sweet, Laravel-related, right?
[17:52:25] <acidjazz> yes
[17:52:34] <acidjazz> its just a laravel version of the php debugbar
[17:52:57] <acidjazz> so now ill customize my accept w/ this chrome extension
[17:53:01] <acidjazz> see if i can get raw json to the browser
[17:53:26] <acidjazz> awesome
[17:53:31] <systemfault> Hehe :)
[17:53:45] <acidjazz> all tis time and im using the wrong header
[17:53:58] <acidjazz> this is great because i want to allow jsonp as well
[17:54:05] <acidjazz> what about appending to accept in jquery?
[17:54:11] <acidjazz> guessing application/jsonp
[17:54:25] <systemfault> jsonp doesn't really exist
[17:54:31] <systemfault> It's "javascript"
[17:54:46] <acidjazz> its just sort of a wrapper, yea
[17:55:38] <acidjazz> but i guess i can just look for if a callback is placed
[17:55:47] <acidjazz> query parameter? or header?
[17:56:17] <acidjazz> actually it has to be a parameter
[17:56:34] <acidjazz> because jsonp is called via <script, so theres no way i could specify a header that way
[17:56:53] <systemfault> Yeah, exactly, it's via a get parameter
[18:07:19] <acidjazz> so you just generally function callbackName() { return {"json"}; }
[18:07:29] <acidjazz> looks like that works
[18:11:31] <acidjazz> hah
[18:11:37] <acidjazz> i forgot this application/json accept was turned on still
[18:11:41] <acidjazz> hitting github and other sites
[18:11:47] <acidjazz> funny how alot of em return json and obey it
[19:37:33] <adamsilver> Why this is working: $(c).find('div[class*="_eee"]').css("background-color", "red"); and this is not: $(c).find('div[class$="_eee"]').css("background-color", "red"); in jQ 3? Was the ends with selector changed?
[19:39:46] <systemfault> adamsilver: You're asking why an orange is not an apple?
[19:40:00] <systemfault> These are two different selectors.
[19:40:10] <systemfault> Can't expect them to do the same thing.
[19:41:09] <systemfault> The first one checks if _eee is anywhere in the class attribute and the other one checks if the class attribute ends with _eee
[19:42:21] <adamsilver> systemfault: Right, so the two should change the color if the selector ends with _eee
[19:42:41] <systemfault> If the class attribute ends with _eee
[19:43:16] <systemfault> <div class="hello_eee test"></div>   *= will work but not $=
[19:43:39] <systemfault> <div class="hello_eee"></div> here both *= and $= will work
[19:46:54] <adamsilver> systemfault: the problem is I have <div class="hello_eee"></div> and the ends with is not working
[19:48:48] <systemfault> Can you write a testcase on jsfiddle or something?
[19:50:12] <adamsilver> systemfault: I will see if I can replicate it and repost here. Thanks
[20:29:31] <mercanet> hi
[20:30:02] <mercanet> Can somebody help me?
[20:30:24] <Robdgreat> mercanet: if you ask a question, maybe
[20:31:08] <Robdgreat> unfortunately, until then we have no idea whether we can or not
[20:32:13] <mercanet> yes
[20:33:54] <mercanet> I have a website that uses jquery 1.12.4 and want to put in the username box a user. But I can not.
[20:34:17] <mercanet> website is: https://www.topoption.com
[20:34:25] <adamsilver> How can I have this applied even for items created on the fly: $('div[class*="_something"]').bind("DOMSubtreeModified", function () { ...
[20:34:33] <Robdgreat> going to need a little more information. What is actually happening when you try, mercanet
[20:34:50] <mercanet> as I can with jquery put a user in the box above?
[20:35:22] <mercanet> one moment
[20:35:57] <mercanet> this
[20:35:58] <mercanet> $("#ts-email").val("test");
[20:35:59] <Robdgreat> I don't know what you mean by put a user in the box. I'm able to type in the box, assuming you're talking about the one at the top of the page
[20:36:03] <Robdgreat> oh
[20:36:44] <Robdgreat> you're not loading jquery
[20:36:50] <Robdgreat> "$ is not a function"
[20:37:26] <mercanet> if you run this:
[20:37:27] <mercanet> if (typeof jQuery != 'undefined') {       // jQuery is loaded => print the version     alert(jQuery.fn.jquery); }
[20:37:46] <mercanet> it show 1.12.4
[20:38:31] <mercanet> and javascript as I can put the user?
[20:39:49] <Robdgreat> use jQuery() instead of $()
[20:40:13] <Robdgreat> your jquery is calling .noconflict() at some point so you don't have $ available
[20:40:39] <Robdgreat> jQuery("#ts-email").val("test");
[20:41:21] <mercanet> amazing just what I needed. Thank you very much
[20:41:26] <Robdgreat> cheers
