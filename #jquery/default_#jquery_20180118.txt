[02:06:00] <loginoob> https://jsfiddle.net/90zc465f/ In this i have two stepper in a div initially i want to show nly first stepper and when clicked on more button the whole div show show
[02:06:12] <loginoob> what can i do to achieve this
[02:06:51] <Cork> loginoob: is this going to be a form?
[02:12:07] <loginoob> Cork: No
[02:12:40] <Cork> loginoob: then just have a div or section wrapping the different parts and have a class to show/hide them
[03:04:28] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  i considered about it and you are right i am sorry
[03:35:53] <fas3r> Hello, how to reset a select to the default value ? do i need to loop over the options and check the one with defaultValue ?
[03:36:50] <Cork> fas3r: $('select')[0].reset()
[03:37:09] <Cork> i don't remember if jquery proxies it so you can write $('select').reset()
[03:41:27] <fas3r> Cork: nop does not work https://jsfiddle.net/v9fx30te/1/
[03:43:25] <Woet> fas3r: what did you google for so far?
[03:43:55] <Cork> ah, damn ya that was an old solution that hasn't worked for a long time in browsers...
[03:44:41] <Woet> fas3r: because when I google "jquery reset select" the first result works
[03:44:55] <Cork> fas3r: then yes you need to loop the option values and set selected = defaultSelected
[03:44:56] <fas3r> Cork: for now I give the name "default" to the options and just do a $('select').val('default') .
[03:45:55] <Cork> fas3r: defaultSelected
[03:45:56] <Cork> opps
[03:46:00] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v9fx30te/2/
[03:48:23] <fas3r> Cork: great, thanks :) exactly what I was looking for.
[06:16:44] <xinobi> I've been using mainly three methods to build html object and I've found that when using jquery $('<div>', { properties }) it's nice to add event listeners but not nice to build large object due to the amount of complexity and the use of prepend or append methods... well the order method I use often is string concatenation but that is not very nice and doesn't provide much control over the object being built so i've tried moustache an
[06:16:57] <xinobi> and such... but not having found a great method!
[06:17:39] <xinobi> err: order = other
[06:18:12] <xinobi> what do you guys use?
[06:25:21] <xinobi> I also found that building an html element with $('<div>', { properties }) add a considerable amount of processing time to the overall creation...
[06:33:53] <anki> Having  a question regarding read info from json_encoded string by php
[06:33:55] <anki> https://pastebin.com/5rQxZ4Tn
[06:34:36] <anki> I have php output like above and want to read label dynamically like using loop
[06:35:36] <anki> I have tried to use json.parse but its not work
[06:36:16] <anki> anyone would like to give suggestion ?
[06:37:39] <xinobi> anki: look at the server response and tell me whats the mime type
[06:39:14] <anki> Sorry,I dont get your point
[06:39:46] <xinobi> anki: if its json type well you have an object you can use map or each I'm sure that you can use some other functions to loop through the json object etc
[06:41:20] <xinobi> anki: many times php developers use json encode but they forget to set mime type to json so when the response gets back to the client it will be interpreted as a string and not as a json object
[06:48:29] <anki> Ohh,I did same
[06:52:37] <anki> Is there any possibilities without set mime type ,Read string and parse value from it ?
[06:56:05] <Cork> anki: what mime type are you setting on the json response today?
[06:56:39] <Cork> normally php scripts set text/html and then the server is lying so...
[06:57:42] <anki> I didnt define anything so may be it is text/html.I dont know actually how to check mime type in php
[06:57:53] <anki> If you guide then i can check and paste it here
[06:58:15] <Cork> just set a <?php header("Content-Type: application/json"); ?> then
[06:58:23] <Cork> before you echo anything
[06:58:27] <Cork> its all you need to do
[06:59:13] <Cork> * <?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); ?>
[07:00:25] <anki> text/x-php
[07:00:35] <Cork> x-php?!?
[07:00:41] <anki> yeah
[07:00:46] <Cork> that isn't even a valid mime type
[07:01:15] <anki> May be i am using framework of php that's why showing like  invalid mime type
[07:01:35] <Cork> ya, so again before you return the json, just run the header() command and things should work just fine
[07:02:08] <anki> Yeah,Thanks for help
[07:02:09] <anki> But in my case it is not possible to define everywhere and have to manage from javascript
[07:02:23] <anki> Have you any suggestion for same query ?
[07:02:47] <Cork> you can't really fix the server lying from javascript
[07:03:03] <anki> Nope,It is not possible  :(
[07:03:06] <Cork> all javascript can do is ignore what the server says and statically treat the content as something
[07:03:26] <Cork> but that means fragile code
[07:03:44] <Cork> simplest is to just statically do JSON.parse() on the data response
[07:03:57] <Cork> as long as the mime type doesn't fall into a form that is already parsed
[07:04:03] <Cork> cause then it will just fail
[07:04:16] <anki> Okay
[07:06:05] <Cork> (it still means you create a broken api, and it isn't a grate way to solve it but...)
[09:23:19] <MikeD_> is there a method to programmatically open the option list of a select?  much like when you use .focus() and .select() to draw attention to an input... but to actually open the options
[09:23:58] <Cork> MikeD_: there are some hacks that works in some browsers; but no standardized way no
[09:24:41] <MikeD_> thanks, that saved me a lot of research time :)
[09:25:14] <MikeD_> "feature not implemented because some dude in IRC said it can't be done"  (good enough for me)
[09:25:28] <Cork> didn't way can't be done
[09:25:37] <Cork> all i said is there are no standardized way
[09:26:28] <Cork> if i remember correctly webkit based browsers can open it by triggering a click event on the element
[09:26:34] <MikeD_> understood - but i'm not interested in non-standard hackiness, it's too much work to implement and too much maintenance liability
[09:28:11] <MikeD_> even triggering a click has potential side effects when other devs register click listener and it's not a "real" click... so it's cool
[09:28:59] <MikeD_> as a dev, i like to have the first answer to "can we just..." be a strong No... and wait to see how sad that makes the asker... sometimes we can get away with it.
[09:29:31] <MikeD_> bbiab - scrum
[09:29:54] <Cork> heh
[10:35:52] <lissitzki> hi
[10:36:08] <lissitzki> I have this code for a animated menu https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/
[10:37:49] <lissitzki> So i have the script in a file, it is executable, then in the head of the page the reference to the script but my menu do not work as expected
[10:38:37] <taplar> what have you done to debug?
[10:38:51] <lissitzki> in the console nothing is shown
[10:38:59] <lissitzki> so i imageine the script is not running
[10:39:31] <lissitzki> jquery is loaded
[10:41:02] <taplar> have you added any console logs to the logic to see if things are running, or if things are being found?
[10:47:14] <lissitzki> @taplar, noI'm not sure what you mean
[10:47:25] <poboy> Hmm.  I don't want to use .html because there are other options in this id.  how would I replace just this one option and not affect the existing ones?  $('#bkDebtorSelect_0').html('<option value="foo">foo</option>');
[10:49:13] <taplar> lissitzki: you can put console logs before and after your logic.  you can console log the $(selector).length to see if anything is being found.  various things can be logged to get more information
[10:49:45] <taplar> poboy: which option do you want to replace?
[10:49:55] <taplar> cause there is the replaceWith() method if you target that option first
[10:53:20] <poboy> here's a fiddle.  I want to replace whichever is highlighted.  https://jsfiddle.net/oyztuoer/
[10:54:22] <taplar> what if they select multiple?
[10:54:55] <poboy> I need to build that out still, they should not be able to
[10:55:57] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/oyztuoer/1/  you just have to take the multiple off
[10:56:21] <taplar> but if that is the case, then the option you want to replace would be the one that has the same value as the select has
[10:56:31] <taplar> or iirc, there is a selectedIndex property on a select
[10:57:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/oyztuoer/2/
[10:59:18] <Guest95256> Is there a way to check checkboxes on load, but also register it as a click? I have a script that pulls the variables from my url and checks their right boxes, but since the checkboxes weren't 'clicked' it doesnt activate my filters
[11:00:05] <taplar> you can trigger('click') on an element to generate an event.  so long as the logic doesn't rely on it being a real user click it will work
[11:00:31] <Guest95256> https://bpaste.net/show/ce7c8c83d03c
[11:01:02] <Guest95256> Oh, so after the checkboxes get checked, I should trigger clicks on them?
[11:01:20] <taplar> you can do that, yes
[11:04:34] <poboy>  but taplar, I still don't see how to change just the html for that selected option
[11:05:02] <taplar> if you have the value, you can find the option that has the value.  or if you have the index, you can find the options and get the one at the index
[11:05:13] <taplar> in either case you have the option and you can replaceWith(newThing) on that option
[11:06:45] <Guest95256> thoughts on this? https://bpaste.net/show/99851e289d72
[11:07:43] <taplar> i'm confused on what the question is
[11:16:33] <Guest95256> taplar, I still can't seem to trigger the click. it checks the correct boxes, but since it's not an actual click on them it doesn't want to filter my results
[11:17:02] <taplar> is the filter logic based on click, or on change?
[11:19:18] <Guest95256> on change
[11:19:36] <taplar> so you'd want to trigger('change'), not click
[11:20:11] <Guest95256> boom
[11:20:19] <Guest95256> i swear I'm stupid sometimes haha
[11:20:32] <Guest95256> appreciate the help tap!
[11:20:35] <taplar> np
[11:41:41] <poboy> taplar, it works when I hardcode the option value but I can't figure how to pass in $select.val()   https://jsfiddle.net/oyztuoer/3/
[11:56:13] <lissitzki> @taplar, so I've add a console log to my script, and my selector I supposed is index
[11:56:22] <lissitzki> well index is not defined in console
[12:02:46] <lissitzki> anyone can help with a simple jquery? here's the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/  but I cannot let it work on the site. Checking the console it give me "menu is not defined"
[12:09:52] <Woet> lissitzki: i see no such error
[12:10:14] <Woet> and i see "parent menu 1 2 3 4 5 6 7"
[12:10:20] <Woet> so not sure what the issue is
[12:10:32] <lissitzki> Woet, i the fiddle is working great, I cannot upload it in my site
[12:10:46] <Woet> lissitzki: so can you share the actual code that causes this error?
[12:10:55] <lissitzki> i'll try
[12:10:59] <Woet> lissitzki: theres no mention of "menu" in your code so clearly it's not related to the "
[12:11:03] <Woet> menu is not defined" error
[12:11:41] <lissitzki> Woet, now I updated it
[12:11:51] <lissitzki> you should see
[12:12:59] <Woet> lissitzki: only if you sent an updated jsfiddle link
[12:13:06] <lissitzki> allright
[12:13:13] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/1/
[12:13:40] <lissitzki> the code that gives me error in my site is exactly the same
[12:13:45] <Woet> lissitzki: evidently not.
[12:15:46] <poboy> I don't see an error in the console for that
[12:16:31] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/2/
[12:16:42] <lissitzki> these are the two codes
[12:17:13] <lissitzki> but wait, the main problem is that I don't see the code in action
[12:17:24] <lissitzki> the menu is not whoing in my site
[12:17:29] <Woet> lissitzki: share the code that causes the issue
[12:17:38] <Woet> lissitzki: i don't know why you keep linking working jsfiddles
[12:17:56] <Woet> lissitzki: okay, finally, i see the error
[12:18:02] <Woet> lissitzki: console.log($menu) - where are you defining $menu?
[12:18:14] <lissitzki> ok
[12:18:36] <lissitzki> i'll try to explain
[12:19:09] <lissitzki> or better I'll upload my site (now it is on local) so i can get some help on that
[12:19:39] <lissitzki> the error for menu it was just me trying to get an output from the console
[12:19:59] <lissitzki> because i can't get the code working and the console is not giving any output
[12:32:43] <Woet> lissitzki: so share the code that isn't working.
[12:35:10] <lissitzki> http://justjpg.imodri.com/
[12:35:25] <lissitzki> this is the site where i add the code in the fiddle
[12:35:48] <lissitzki> the menu should appear on the top after the name
[12:36:31] <Woet> lissitzki: please turn it into a fiddle.
[12:37:05] <lissitzki> it's the one i sent before
[12:37:44] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/3/
[12:38:14] <lissitzki> in the fiddle is working
[12:38:19] <lissitzki> that's the problem
[12:38:25] <lissitzki> not in the site
[12:38:36] <lissitzki> how can i debug it?
[12:40:00] <taplar> did you add logging like i suggested earlier?
[12:40:28] <lissitzki> i tried poorly
[12:40:38] <taplar> so what did you do?
[12:40:44] <taplar> show in your fiddle the logging that you did
[12:40:49] <lissitzki> i add console.log($menu)
[12:41:12] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/4/
[12:41:20] <taplar> there is no $menu in that first fiddle
[12:41:24] <lissitzki> but menu is not the right selector
[12:41:37] <lissitzki> i changed it
[12:42:05] <taplar> ok, so update the fiddle with the right one?
[12:42:13] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/4/
[12:42:19] <lissitzki> this  one is updated
[12:42:40] <taplar> looks the same to me.  $menu is still not defined
[12:43:12] <taplar> what are you looping over?
[12:43:53] <lissitzki> mmh wait i'm missing something
[12:45:23] <lissitzki> the function loops over index?
[12:45:33] <lissitzki> next(index)
[12:45:49] <taplar> "loops over an index".  does that sound right to you?
[12:46:16] <taplar> you got 'things' that you loop over.  you got an index for those 'things'
[12:46:20] <taplar> what are the things?
[12:47:33] <lissitzki> list element
[12:48:13] <taplar> cool, so you should have 1 to many <li> right?
[12:48:32] <lissitzki> some yes
[12:48:38] <taplar> do you?
[12:48:58] <lissitzki> 5 of them for the moment
[12:49:02] <taplar> how can you verify that?
[12:49:20] <lissitzki> index
[12:49:26] <taplar> no
[12:49:35] <taplar> you are looking them up
[12:49:40] <taplar> that lookup should find them all
[12:49:49] <taplar> how can you check how many it found?
[12:50:55] <lissitzki> the time it loops?
[12:51:03] <taplar> no
[12:51:22] <taplar> i'm pretty sure i mentioned this earlier, but you you can look at the length of a jquery selector
[12:51:27] <taplar> $(selector).length
[12:51:32] <lissitzki> oh yes
[12:51:48] <taplar> so before you even go into your loop, log how many elements you found
[12:53:30] <lissitzki> ok thanks, but the selector should be the list element, how can i define them?
[12:53:47] <taplar> it is the list elements
[12:53:58] <taplar> $('#menu > ul > li')
[12:55:17] <taplar> you're already doing that and storing it in children
[12:55:28] <taplar> you can just log the children.length
[12:57:57] <lissitzki> console.log($children).lenght?
[12:58:21] <taplar> console.log(children.length)
[12:58:50] <lissitzki> sure
[12:59:14] <lissitzki> TypeError: console.log(...) is undefined
[12:59:23] <taplar> show me in the fiddle
[12:59:58] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/6/
[13:00:12] * taplar sighs
[13:00:14] <taplar> dude
[13:00:23] <taplar> how is what you typed the same as what i typed?
[13:00:28] <taplar> and i said before the loop
[13:00:56] <lissitzki> you said before and after
[13:01:00] <lissitzki> :)
[13:01:00] <Woet> [01:58:20]  <taplar>	console.log(children.length)
[13:01:06] <taplar> ^^^
[13:01:13] <Woet> yea, and it's not before, and you somehow didn't manage to copy/paste his code
[13:01:17] <taplar> i said before -the loop-
[13:01:21] <Woet> [01:51:48]  <taplar>	so before you even go into your loop, log how many elements you found
[13:02:12] <poboy> I'm tempted just to walk out and never come back, lol
[13:02:33] <taplar> am i that bad?
[13:02:49] <lissitzki> 5
[13:02:53] <lissitzki> ok i got it
[13:03:02] <lissitzki> '-_-
[13:03:10] <taplar> lissitzki: and that's on your page?
[13:03:23] <poboy> I meant at work
[13:03:29] <taplar> lol
[13:03:38] <taplar> playing with my heart here man
[13:03:56] <lissitzki> no, 0
[13:03:59] <lissitzki> on my site
[13:04:05] <taplar> so, what does that tell you?
[13:04:22] <lissitzki> not working
[13:04:33] <taplar> what could be the reasons why it's not working?
[13:05:05] <taplar> there are at least three potential reasons
[13:05:08] <lissitzki> that  was the reason i came here, but i learn something
[13:05:23] <lissitzki> ok 3 reasons
[13:05:28] <Woet> lissitzki: we help you learn, not solve the issue for you
[13:05:49] <taplar> 1) Your selector is wrong.
[13:06:11] <taplar> 2) The selector is right, but the elements don't exist yet
[13:06:41] <taplar> *due to script placement
[13:06:55] <taplar> 3) The selector is right, but the elements don't exist yet due to asynchronous logic
[13:07:09] <taplar> do you understand those issues?
[13:07:35] <lissitzki> 3 one is the worst
[13:07:42] <lissitzki> can't nunderstand it
[13:07:59] <taplar> when you do a lookup, $(selector)
[13:08:04] <lissitzki> the second was my idea
[13:08:10] <taplar> it will only find elements that exist in the DOM -at that point in time-
[13:08:25] <taplar> so if they are not there to find, it cannot find them
[13:08:31] <lissitzki> ok
[13:08:50] <taplar> that can be because you are trying to do the lookup in the <head> without a document ready, or the elements are created later through ajax
[13:09:01] <taplar> or even just dynamically without ajax
[13:09:21] <taplar> in any case, they must exist in the DOM at the time you try to find them
[13:10:05] <lissitzki> in fact i didn't add a document ready
[13:10:14] <taplar> and where is your script paced?
[13:10:37] <lissitzki> in a a script called from the head
[13:10:43] <taplar> :)
[13:10:51] <taplar> so it could be #2
[13:12:03] <lissitzki> i call the script with         {% do assets.addJs('theme://js/rudy-menu.js') %}
[13:12:32] <lissitzki> rudy-menu is executable
[13:12:55] <taplar> try surrounding your script in a document ready
[13:13:06] <lissitzki> ya
[13:14:52] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/m55aazuq/8/
[13:15:02] <lissitzki> i did it but not working on my site
[13:15:18] <lissitzki> still 0 in the log
[13:15:19] <taplar> so, look back and what i said about the lookup
[13:15:34] <taplar> and then look at your fiddle and guess what i'm going to tell you, :)
[13:16:40] <lissitzki> well the document ready was done to be sure the lookup could find the element at the right time
[13:16:57] <taplar> but the look up is outside the document ready...
[13:17:46] <lissitzki> YES!
[13:17:49] <lissitzki> working
[13:17:53] <taplar> heh
[13:18:08] <lissitzki> it was my first time
[13:18:22] <lissitzki> thank you
[13:18:33] <taplar> np.  hope you feel like you learned some stuff
[13:18:40] <lissitzki> of course
[13:18:51] <lissitzki> you were were patient
[13:19:03] <lissitzki> thank you for your time
[13:19:13] <taplar> i got a sub sandwich in my hands.  i'm eternally patient right now
[13:19:40] <lissitzki> i was lucky then
[13:19:50] <taplar> ;)
[14:49:19] <hellyeah> yo
[15:02:07] <taplar> yoooooooo
[15:18:22] <hellyeah> how goes
[15:20:01] <taplar> so so
[15:20:59] <GALACTICRIMINAL> same old same old
[15:26:27] <GALACTICRIMINAL> do you guys prefer writing code with jquery or with vanilla js in vuejs?
[15:27:11] <taplar> i don't really have a preference
[15:27:34] <taplar> i'll do whatever.  though here lately i wish our app was in vue
[15:30:24] <hellyeah> what did yo use in your app?
[15:30:32] <hellyeah> vue is pretty straightforward
[15:30:39] <taplar> straight markup
[15:31:03] <hellyeah> vue markup?
[15:31:11] <taplar> plain html
[15:43:14] <Guest86557> what if i dont want to resolve or reject a promise
[15:43:28] <taplar> then don't?
[15:43:42] <Guest86557> ya but will it hang?
[15:43:54] <taplar> nothing is actively running
[15:44:13] <Guest86557> do i need to cleanup or anything
[15:44:36] <taplar> if you remove all references to it, the GC will clean it up
[16:19:00] <deepfreez> Hi, I have this jquery https://paste.laravel.io/6706d401-3a82-41f2-aa76-4970fa084605 , but if I don't upload something in invitation_quizz put me in undefined value in db... I want to don't pass the undefined variable, any ideas?
[16:20:22] <taplar> you can check to see if the value is set before adding it to the formData
[16:20:29] <taplar> but you will also need to validate on the backend
[16:21:14] <deepfreez> yes
[16:21:19] <deepfreez> I use isset ? or
[16:21:34] <deepfreez> I get some TypeError: $(...).first(...)[0] is undefined
[16:21:47] <taplar> $(...).length > 0
[16:22:15] <taplar> side note: first()[0] is redundant
[16:22:16] <deepfreez> $("input[name='invitation_quizz']").first()[0].files[0];
[16:22:23] <taplar> just do [0]
[16:22:40] <deepfreez> $("input[name='invitation_quizz']").first()[0].files[0].length > 0 ?
[16:22:47] <taplar> no
[16:22:55] <taplar> you check the length off the selector before you try to access
[16:23:30] <deepfreez> can you please give me a example for my code? thanks
[16:23:33] <taplar> $("input[name='invitation_quizz']").prop('files').length > 0
[16:23:49] <taplar> assuming there is only one input with that name on the page
[16:24:21] <deepfreez> if($("input[name='invitation_quizz']").prop('files').length > 0) { var invitation_quizz = $("input[name='invitation_quizz']").first()[0].files[0]; }
[16:25:24] <taplar> again, first()[0] is redundant
[16:26:01] <taplar> first() says, give me a jquery object containing only the first element from this previous jquery object
[16:26:19] <taplar> then [0] says give me the first raw dom element from this jquery object
[16:26:26] <taplar> you can just do [0] and skip the first() call
[16:27:05] <deepfreez> can you modify my jquery?
[16:27:15] <deepfreez> pff not so god of this
[16:27:25] <taplar> if you'll make a fiddle of it, sure, :)
[16:27:53] <deepfreez> let me do it
[16:28:00] <deepfreez> I think
[16:28:07] <deepfreez> never do it
[16:28:18] <taplar> or a codepen if you are more familiar with that site
[16:30:57] <deepfreez> sorry I have a lot of php there and will not work to put
[16:31:23] <taplar> i just need the js.  i don't need a fully working example
[16:31:42] <taplar> you're asking how to do the conditional
[16:34:35] <deepfreez> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qpLBYa
[16:34:40] <deepfreez> not work
[16:41:11] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wpRvYY?editors=1010
[16:41:29] <taplar> so there is some if logic around the setting of the value, and then some if logic on the putting it on the formData
[16:43:05] <deepfreez> let me check
[16:47:43] <deepfreez> it's working, now I need only to do the backend stuff
[16:47:48] <deepfreez> thank you
[16:48:04] <taplar> do you understand what it is doing?
[16:49:49] <deepfreez> Yes, now Yes
[17:06:56] <Guest86557> i understand
[17:07:31] <taplar> awesome
[17:10:40] <deepfreez> lol
[17:15:23] <catbadger> I got written up the other day for applying for a job with my work computer. I did this because i was asked to fix a bug in a job post for MY JOB.
[17:17:32] <taplar> sounds fun
[18:05:09] <taplar> i hate arbitration agreements
[18:38:32] <z1haze> would `this.$el.parent().css('top', $(window).offset().top);` move this.$el.parent() to the top of the window?
[18:39:56] <duch_kazatel> z1haze do you want it to just stick to the top of the window
[18:39:56] <duch_kazatel> ?
[18:40:26] <z1haze> if I have a modal that is taller than the window, positining it to the center of the screen sometimes cuts off the top part
[18:40:30] <z1haze> so yeah, basically I think I want to do that
[18:40:55] <robertmaxrees> hummm.
[18:41:06] <z1haze> i always confuse you robertmaxrees :D
[18:41:10] <robertmaxrees> well, short of fixing the ui so that the modal isn't THAT big, try position: fixed;
[18:41:11] <z1haze> anyway i think this is workin `this.$el.parent().css('top', $(document).scrollTop());`
[18:42:29] <robertmaxrees> doing position: fixed; will be a little cleaner imo.
[18:43:08] <z1haze> then it doesnt scroll
[18:43:19] <robertmaxrees> the contents of the modal should scroll, imo.
[18:43:23] <robertmaxrees> not the page.
[18:43:25] <z1haze> i dont disagree
[18:43:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:43:38] <z1haze> but im not in charge :D
[18:43:55] <robertmaxrees> wait so they really want the whole window to scroll?
[18:43:56] <z1haze> i wouldnt be using jquery if i were
[18:43:58] <z1haze> yep
[18:44:02] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:44:05] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:44:11] <z1haze> haha
[18:44:37] <robertmaxrees> whyyyy do people do stuff like that D:
[18:46:18] <z1haze> you should see the site..
[18:46:26] <z1haze> actually no, you shouldnt
[18:46:41] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pny51kwL/
[18:46:44] <robertmaxrees> it's just so simple
[18:47:20] <z1haze> i think they feel its easier for mobile users to just scroll their screen
[18:47:25] <z1haze> rather than a content div
[18:47:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:47:39] <robertmaxrees> we actually said no modals on mobile and open it in a new window.
[18:47:49] <robertmaxrees> like, it becomes the entire screen.
[18:47:59] <robertmaxrees> sometimes even a new URL.
[20:10:01] <z1haze> i found a major whole in my Dialog class
[20:10:05] <z1haze> hole*
[20:10:21] <z1haze> maybe its just the way im implementing it, hope it can be fixed
[20:11:00] <z1haze> but currently, when a new dialog is opened, it calls this.close() first, to make sure theres no current instance.. and when this happens, it doesnt actually call close() on the dialog that was open, therefore, no events for closing ever fire
[20:11:03] <robertmaxrees> what's the hole?
[20:11:12] <z1haze> unless you explicity close the dialog on purpose
[20:11:15] <robertmaxrees> ah
[20:11:18] <z1haze> for example, if one dialog opens another
[20:12:23] <z1haze> and thoughts?
