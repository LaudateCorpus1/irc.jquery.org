[02:48:51] <mathi> hi
[02:58:43] <lrvick> http://new.lrvick.net/js/jquery-githubnav/demo.html can anyone reccomend a nice way to handle a tree-view ?
[03:01:23] <mathi> is it possible to get the content length of an ajax response?
[03:03:18] <lrvick> obj.length() ?
[03:03:35] <ravenzz> getResponseHeader ?
[03:03:49] <ravenzz> or getAllResponseHeaders
[03:03:52] <ravenzz> i guess
[03:04:19] <mathi> lrvick, I mean the http COntent Length, which is a number of bytes, .length on the data will give me a number of characters
[03:04:30] <lrvick> ah
[03:04:35] <lrvick> you could guess based on that
[03:04:38] <lrvick> :-P
[03:06:06] <mathi> ravenzz, why getAllResponseHeaders, isn't getResponseHeader sufficient?
[03:07:04] <mathi> lrvick, nope, especially if you use gzip and if you dead with UTF8 characters I guess
[03:07:10] <ravenzz> yes with getAllResponseHeaders you get any header
[03:07:50] <ravenzz> otherwise you can call getResponseHeader('Content-Length') iirc
[03:08:09] <ravenzz> take a look at the doc
[03:11:16] <mathi> ravenzz, alert(xhr.getResponseHeader("Content-Length"));
[03:11:36] <mathi> the success callback comes with the hxr object since 1.4
[03:11:43] <mathi> *xhr
[03:11:51] <ravenzz> so what?
[03:12:14] <mathi> well, got it working
[03:12:31] <ravenzz> yup have fun
[03:12:40] <mathi> :))
[03:12:50] <mathi> thank you for the help:)
[03:13:21] <ravenzz> yw anyway, google is your friend
[03:13:26] <ravenzz> i found it there
[04:35:15] <Zerpex> Hello guys, I'm having this site: http://kirkehost.dk/losninger/ where when you scroll the sidebar will be floating with the page, problem is, if you're running on a smaller screensize, the last blue box, will be in front of the box in the footerâ€¦ Is there a way to determine when it hits a position, so it should stop scrolling, and then just be etc 20px above the footer?
[04:36:31] <shadykhan> i belive u can acomplish that with css media query
[04:36:31] <shadykhan> http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/
[04:37:36] <Zerpex> it should be supported in IE
[04:42:45] <Hopsy> Happy new year everyone!
[04:42:52] <Dunstkreis> Zerpex seems if you are using a js framework ....
[04:43:26] <Zerpex> Dunstkreis: I'm using jquery
[04:45:21] <Dunstkreis> yeah, and it switches the class!? so i would anyway think, that this behaviour is possible without JS, but however, if you decided to do it like this, why dont you try observing the position relative to the bottom through jQuery?
[04:46:13] <Dunstkreis> gosh :D im sorry. *GG* i though im in css channel :D
[04:46:17] <Zerpex> because I don't know how to determine, if the end of the floating div, is etc 250px from the bottom of the full page height
[04:46:20] <Dunstkreis> damn :D
[04:50:19] <Dunstkreis> Zerpex how did you solve, that you switch classes? cant find it in the bunch of files you include in the head ...
[04:51:14] <Zerpex> Dunstkreis: http://pastebin.com/rY5X5e22
[04:51:48] <Zerpex> the top part of the script
[04:54:44] <Dunstkreis> yeah, i see. and whats about getting the scrollTop position of the footer and compare it to the scrollTop + height of your menu?
[04:56:03] <Zerpex> hmm, let me see if I can figure that out :P Not a jquery / js pro :(
[04:56:10] <Dunstkreis> substract this (and a offset) from the top position ...
[05:26:21] <Zerpex> let me see, I get the height of the footer, + 60 pixel, which returns 349px, then I should check if the sidebar, is 349px from the bottom of the page.. How can I do that? code is there: http://pastebin.com/LCVKvqBK
[05:47:22] <tman> is there a way to use jquery to make certain components of a site more customized for a phone, like for example, my torch has an alarm app which has these cool spinners that i'd love to use in this web app i'm building
[05:47:57] <tman> is there a way to do that?  so for example, a textfield, when gained focus, has some proprietary content that comes up in the gui of the bb device
[05:50:28] <tman> hmm looks like there's something called webworks..
[06:02:47] <Snooops> Hi, i want to reload my javascript file after a call. is that possible?
[06:09:52] <shadykhan> As a front end developer who already knows html/css/js/jquery what are some other languages that will compliment my skill set?
[06:23:46] <Snooops> hmm damn, im not able to map triggers do dynamical content (ajax)
[06:23:49] <Snooops> any idea here?
[06:50:24] <aple> I'm a JS newb, anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? I'm trying to get the window to add or subtract 1 from the bg position everytime the user scrolls: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/528435/
[06:54:23] <aple> Here's a more accurate paste: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/528442/
[06:54:47] <aple> It doesn't return anything in the console, but also doesn't "do" anything...
[06:59:48] <aple> Trying this too, but it's returning the bg position as "0, 50%" one time, and doesn't repeat... :(
[06:59:48] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/528448/
[07:01:20] <Woet> ?demo @ aple
[07:01:29] <Woet> where is that bot
[07:01:46] <Woet> aple: use www.jqfiddle.net for a live working demo pelase.
[07:02:02] <IamTrying> How to change the browser scrollbar like they started (every scrollbar is now they changed?) ? e.g: http://support.google.com/chrome/?hl=en
[07:02:35] <Woet> IamTrying: what?
[07:03:02] <IamTrying> Woet, http://support.google.com/chrome/?hl=en    the right scroll bar looks not default scrool bar anymore.
[07:03:34] <Woet> IamTrying: http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/resource/all.css?v=381_2
[07:03:46] <ravenzz> IamTrying you probably can do that just in webkit browsers
[07:03:48] <Woet> search for -scrollbar
[07:03:59] <Woet> and what ravenzz sai
[07:04:01] <Woet> said
[07:05:40] <IamTrying> ravenzz, cool, i want webkit browsers only, Internet explorer is suspended in my community  :)
[07:05:46] <IamTrying> Woet, thats all ? http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/resource/all.css?v=381_2
[07:06:00] <Woet> IamTrying: webkit = safari and chrome
[07:06:07] <Woet> IamTrying: so it won't work on firefox either
[07:06:12] <Woet> IamTrying: and yes, it seems that's all.
[07:06:16] <Woet> try it.
[07:06:16] <aple> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/9zfVA/
[07:06:32] <IamTrying> Woet, well sooner or later chrome will be the winner so its ok thanks!!
[07:06:47] <Woet> aple: works for me
[07:07:03] <Woet> image goes right when i scroll
[07:07:05] <aple> It tosses the bg image down 50%
[07:07:14] <aple> Right, that's good, but it also goes down 50$
[07:07:16] <aple> 50%
[07:07:17] <Woet> oh, i see what you mean
[07:07:29] <aple> :)
[07:09:09] <Woet> aple: http://jsfiddle.net/9zfVA/2/
[07:10:03] <aple> Hm, doesn't budge for me. What browser?
[07:10:33] <Woet> chrome here
[07:10:42] <Woet> you use firefox i suppose?
[07:11:01] <aple> Yeah
[07:11:15] <aple> (browse with Chrome, dev with FF) ;)
[07:11:29] <Woet> thought so, it doesn't support -y -x according to some site
[07:11:41] <aple> Man, works on Chrome like a charm.
[07:11:48] <aple> Wtf FF is really falling behind...
[07:12:25] <Woet> not sure why you use firefox for dev :p
[07:13:36] <Woet> aple: i think .css cannot do += on 2 values at the same time
[07:13:55] <amphead> I keep getting my submenus flash before the site loads. could someone have a look at this and tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/GWgnN/2/
[07:14:23] <Woet> amphead: css before javascript
[07:14:57] <Woet> amphead: add 'display: none;' to #nav ul
[07:15:24] <amphead> Woet: ok I'll try that
[07:16:24] <amphead> that was magic. thanks Woet. Wow what a relief : D
[07:18:33] <aple> Woet: To be honest, I don't need to scroll 2 values at the same time. Just need to scroll vertically.
[07:18:47] <Woet> aple: what are you trying to do?
[07:19:02] <Woet> might be a better solution
[07:20:47] <aple> I'm trying to make a parallax bg.
[07:20:56] <aple> Basically, slowly scroll the bg by as the user scrolls down/up
[07:21:24] <aple> But my css is pretty complex, so I don't want to fight to get one of the many parallax plugins working with it
[07:21:44] <Woet> aple: http://css-tricks.com/3d-parralax-background-effect/ is not an option?
[07:21:45] <aple> I think Snook may have an answer http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/jquery-bg-image-animations/
[07:21:47] <ravenzz> amphead is not a good practice to hide elements with display:none
[07:21:50] <Woet> looks like simple css
[07:22:48] <aple> Starry Night doesn't work on FF :\
[07:22:59] <Woet> oh okay
[07:23:00] <Woet> silly ff
[07:23:21] <aple> nm, yeah it does
[07:23:49] <aple> I think I'm going to try snook's method, basically just animating the bg position
[07:24:40] <amphead> ravenzz: hould I of make the submenu with jquery ? would that be better?
[07:24:44] <amphead> s*
[07:25:15] <ravenzz> uhm no
[07:26:18] <amphead> ravenzz: oh ok so it's just not good practise. got ya
[07:27:28] <ravenzz> if the client's browser doesn't support js or js is disabled or your script is broken
[07:27:37] <ravenzz> he won't see those items
[07:27:46] <ravenzz> (suubmenus)
[07:30:14] <amphead> well I'm only doing web work around the local area. It's not really a big deal if the client's customers have trouble with usability or what not. They can manage
[07:30:33] <aple> Woet: Any thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/9zfVA/4/
[07:30:51] <aple> Ripping code directly from Snook to no avail. wtfh is wrong with me? http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/jquery-bg-image-animations/
[07:30:58] <ravenzz> amphead do whatever you wan, it is your project
[07:31:12] <ravenzz> +t
[07:32:53] <amphead> ravenzz: well what would be a better option. I'm confused here. any advice is goal imo
[07:33:28] <Woet> ravenzz: his script requires javascript to work anyways to show them
[07:34:25] <onykage> can anyone tell me why ui autocomplete is throwing "this.source is not a function" error?
[07:34:31] <onykage> http://www.pastie.org/3107322
[07:34:36] <onykage> pastie example
[07:37:06] <aple> I hate JS.
[07:37:40] <ravenzz> amphead http://jsfiddle.net/Yrc3M/ :?
[07:41:51] <amphead> yes it's a design flaw when the layout was on the stetch board. Using jquery accordion was suppose to be a little better fited for users that are using lower resolution.
[07:42:28] <ravenzz> resolution is not related to js, you can hanlde that by css
[07:42:43] <ravenzz> (eg using percentages for the width)
[07:43:54] <onykage> http://www.onykage.com/sandbox/jquery/autocomplete.example.html
[07:44:04] <onykage> can anyone tell me why ui autocomplete is throwing "this.source is not a function" error?
[07:44:19] <amphead> there was around 16 submenus I had to place under 8 parent menu items. I did the guess work and figured that a multilayer css menu won't do much better than if I have an accordion
[07:45:45] <amphead> I had the css done and then I measured which menu system was better for resolution 1280×800
[07:45:57] <ravenzz> here is the accordion http://jsfiddle.net/Yrc3M/1/
[07:45:58] <amphead> sorry grammar
[07:46:01] <ravenzz> np
[07:46:58] <amphead> yeah that could do
[07:47:08] <onykage> umm i know i dont know the entire story here amphead but im really curious how accordian is going to be more organised then the standard compressed or sticky nav?
[07:47:10] <ravenzz> there should be a comma after the 2nd variable declaration
[07:48:21] <amphead> the overhead was the gallery submenu which had over 20 items on it. it would of expanded to the end of the horizon if i stuck to the sticky nav
[07:49:49] <amphead> also. I cater for the elderly  which aren't very good at mouse precision
[07:50:23] <ravenzz> k
[07:51:33] <onykage> ahh, elderly webdevel is such a pain
[07:56:31] <amphead> They have missed out on some good e-training manuals. Some very good training manuals they are. sigh
[08:00:25] <kkuno> hi
[08:00:32] <onykage> anyone know anything about ui autocomplete?
[08:00:45] <kkuno> I have a div and a subdiv
[08:00:51] <kkuno> i.e.     div1 > div2
[08:00:57] <kkuno> div2 has 20px fixed height
[08:01:16] <kkuno> I need to hide div1 with animation
[08:01:41] <kkuno> but .hide() changes height to 40px and then hide it
[08:02:04] <kkuno> and it's a very ugly effect to see
[08:02:17] <kkuno> what causes that height increase?
[08:02:21] <onykage> kkuno got a pastie or fiddle?
[08:02:51] <nicholasschulz> Stupid question: I have this function(data), how do I print data? like echo $data in php
[08:03:17] <onykage> alert(data);
[08:03:45] <nicholasschulz> then it pops up, right?
[08:03:51] <nicholasschulz> want to print it inside a div
[08:04:39] <kkuno> onykage, I'm working on it
[08:05:34] <onykage> the just use each(function(){$('#id').append(data)});
[08:06:13] <onykage> or sprintf
[08:07:26] <nicholasschulz> thanks. i think ill use the append
[08:07:37] <onykage> np
[08:09:46] <onykage> anyone know why this is throwing a function error?
[08:09:48] <onykage> http://www.onykage.com/sandbox/jquery/autocomplete.example.html
[08:10:04] <onykage> http://www.pastie.org/3107322
[08:11:51] <amphead> shouldn't value have data assign to it?
[08:11:53] <onykage> has to be something todo with the array but i dont know of any other way to pass an array to js from php
[08:12:40] <amphead> oh sorry I'm thinking of name
[08:13:15] <onykage> was about to say, value is inside the ui core heh =P
[08:13:28] <amphead> my bad
[08:13:32] <onykage> all gravy
[08:13:52] <onykage> im stumped on this..  the doc says i can use a local array
[08:14:14] <onykage> well its about as clean of an array and i can pass it
[08:14:47] <onykage> http://www.onykage.com/sandbox/jquery/getdlist.php
[08:15:18] <iande> onykage: what content-type header are you setting with your PHP script?
[08:15:53] <BinaryKitten> text/html according to the link
[08:16:10] <onykage> yeah, should be default
[08:16:22] <onykage> i havnt changed anything with the header
[08:16:39] <onykage> just passing it a json array
[08:16:45] <iande> that might be the problem, then, jQuery might be interpreting the result as just a plain string
[08:16:56] <iande> $.get(..., function () { ... }, 'json')
[08:17:06] <onykage> doh
[08:17:08] <onykage> sec
[08:17:11] <iande> see if that helps
[08:17:22] <BinaryKitten> header('Content-Type: application/json');
[08:17:26] <BinaryKitten> before output
[08:17:28] <iande> also, that
[08:17:31] <BinaryKitten> should resolve it
[08:17:56] <onykage> nope
[08:17:59] <iande> you'll also want to be careful to ensure that any array provided that way is proper JSON, too
[08:18:12] <onykage> same thing
[08:18:17] <BinaryKitten> echo json_encode(array());
[08:18:34] <onykage> sec i'll paste the php
[08:18:42] <BinaryKitten> onykage did you ad the header?
[08:18:53] <BinaryKitten> because the page is still reporting the wrong type
[08:19:14] <onykage> add a header to the html?
[08:19:30] <onykage> or php
[08:19:42] <iande> oh.. you know what...
[08:19:54] <iande> it's not going to work even with the right header
[08:20:01] <onykage> there we go
[08:20:03] <onykage> what did i do
[08:20:04] <iande> you're setting up the auto-complete with a local variable that's undefined when it's set up
[08:20:29] <onykage> you mean doclist?
[08:20:44] <iande> yeah
[08:21:10] <onykage> k what would be a better way to declare that?
[08:21:33] <iande> move: $("#doctor").autocomplete({source:doclist});
[08:21:37] <iande> into your success callback for $.get
[08:21:48] <iande> after you've set doclist to the result
[08:22:32] <onykage> viola
[08:22:38] <onykage> thats all it was
[08:22:40] <onykage> thanks
[08:24:10] <tomasm-> anyone know how to use scrollTo() to get an item to show above the fold, but relative to the bottom of the window? ie not at the top of the window... if its the last item in a list of items, i want to see as much above it as possible
[08:25:12] <rbd> hey guys, how would I get a specific style for a CSS class (that may or may not be assigned to an element in the DOM)?
[08:57:25] <nicholasschulz> Whats the name of a website that i can show code in?
[09:00:27] <BinaryKitten> ?paste @ nicholasschulz
[09:00:27] <bot-t> nicholasschulz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:00:39] <nicholasschulz> thanks bot-t
[09:00:39] <bot-t> nicholasschulz, I'm a bot you know..
[09:01:01] <nicholasschulz> yes, but thanks anyway.
[09:01:04] * BinaryKitten laughs at someone else thanking the bot for a triggered response
[09:02:53] <nicholasschulz> Whats wrong with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/TbtZf/
[09:03:17] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz how about giving us a hint
[09:03:35] <nicholasschulz> well if i knew i wouldn't ask.
[09:03:46] <BinaryKitten> well what are you trying to do
[09:04:08] <nicholasschulz> it doesn't return anything. even though the page called contains a simple <? echo "it works"; ?>
[09:04:36] <nicholasschulz> I'm trying to append data retrieved from the page called
[09:04:40] <BinaryKitten> ok
[09:05:02] <BinaryKitten> when you look at the page in a browser does it show anything?
[09:05:30] <nicholasschulz> http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php
[09:06:08] <nicholasschulz> look at that page. nothing gets loaded
[09:07:13] <BinaryKitten> urm nicholasschulz
[09:07:21] <BinaryKitten> 1, try formatting the html properly
[09:07:30] <BinaryKitten> you have html or head or even body tags
[09:07:47] <BinaryKitten> the browser is forgiving, but you should use proper markup
[09:08:30] <BinaryKitten> also
[09:08:45] <nicholasschulz> yes i know but as you can see the page is called testdrive.php so i haven't bothered
[09:08:46] <BinaryKitten> if you look at the browser error log, there's a error
[09:08:47] <aple> Is there a jQuery function for detecting where you are at on a webpage? For instance, there is a plugin called "inview" that will detect if something is in the viewport, but I'm curious if jQuery has a lightweight feature/method for doing this? https://github.com/protonet/jquery.inview
[09:09:02] <nicholasschulz> how can i see that? using chrome
[09:09:02] <carlprit> I got a bbcode function here; https://pastee.org/qhes5 I'm wondering if you can make this code alot smaller and nicer? How would you guys do it?
[09:09:05] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz not bothering is bad. You need at least the basic
[09:09:10] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz press F12
[09:09:30] <BinaryKitten> you'll see tht the script errors due to uniqid not existing
[09:09:45] <aple> I'm trying to replicate the effect at the top of the Twitter Bootstrap page (how it adds an active class to each nav element as it comes into view): http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[09:09:45] <nicholasschulz> F12 adjust the sound or open settings on my mac
[09:10:03] <nicholasschulz> ah ok! so if i remove the uniqid it might work?
[09:10:22] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz Spanner -> tools -> developer tools
[09:11:57] <nicholasschulz> ok, got the dev tools now
[09:12:32] <nicholasschulz> ah, thanks i see it now. ill try to fix it :-)
[09:12:59] * BinaryKitten has to rush off but once you have solved that, even if you're just testing stuff.. you need to have html and body tags at least
[09:13:10] <BinaryKitten> some code actively requires it properly
[09:13:51] <nicholasschulz> got it to work now :-)
[09:14:10] <hightekvagabond> For the recordâ€¦. "BinaryKitten" is an awesome handle ;)
[09:14:20] <BinaryKitten> thanks
[09:14:25] <BinaryKitten> had it for a good few years now

[09:16:41] <tman> crap :(
[09:16:48] <tman> so frustating.
[09:16:53] <BinaryKitten> someone else might be able to help
[09:17:05] <tman> http://exptract.tman.ca/
[09:17:11] <BinaryKitten> I might be able to help with some debugging, create a fiddle to show it off
[09:17:13] <tman> BinaryKitten: if you care to see
[09:17:22] <tman> notice the table is full screen (this is going to be for mobile)
[09:17:23] * BinaryKitten needs food and is heading off
[09:17:26] <tman> ok
[09:17:27] <tman> :(
[09:17:29] <tman> ttyl!
[09:17:49] <BinaryKitten> sorry, really need to feed my belly so it stops complaining and draining brain resources
[09:17:51] <BinaryKitten> :D
[09:17:54] <tman> heh
[09:17:57] <tman> i can relate.
[09:20:31] <hightekvagabond> give me a sec tman, I have to go yell at the mineature human because she isn't out of bed yet, then I will look to see if I can help you
[09:27:00] <hightekvagabond> so, tman, your problem is you lose that height when you change months?
[09:30:39] <tman> hightekvagabond
[09:30:42] <tman> yea   :(
[09:30:56] <carlprit> I got a bbcode function here; https://pastee.org/qhes5 I'm wondering if you can make this code alot smaller and nicer? How would you guys do it?
[09:30:57] <tman> i can't seem to figure out how to get the js to execute
[09:31:11] <tman> on ready everything happens corrently
[09:31:13] <tman> correctly*
[09:31:44] <tman> also, yet another problem, is there a way to prevent the onscreen keyboard from appearing on the bb torch?
[09:32:06] <tman> the whole point of the table that appears on input:focus is to not have to use the kb...
[09:32:07] <tman> ARG
[09:32:11] <hightekvagabond> why not just reset the size inside onChangeMonthYear?
[09:32:17] <tman> i did?
[09:32:27] <hightekvagabond> not in code.js
[09:32:39] <tman> 		$(".ui-datepicker td").height(($(window).height() - 80) / 5);
[09:32:43] <tman> here i'll put that back in.
[09:33:01] <hightekvagabond> that was in beforeshow when I looked not onChangeMonthYear
[09:33:11] <tman> yea, i've been trying it
[09:33:13] <tman> in different places...
[09:33:25] <tman> also been trying the "refresh" option.. but to no avail.
[09:33:31] <hightekvagabond> hrms
[09:33:33] <tman> i can clearly understand why it's happening...
[09:33:46] <tman> cos of the ajax that's going on.. but.. there doesn't seem to be a callback..
[09:33:55] <tman> i mean.. beforeShowDay might be it, but i don't know how
[09:36:35] <carlprit> Anyone?
[09:37:28] <hightekvagabond> have you tried using the instance that is passed to onChangeMonthYear in order to do your resizing rather than calling it by selector?
[09:39:30] <hightekvagabond> carlprit: short answerâ€¦. use jquery :P
[09:39:43] <carlprit> haha yea
[09:39:45] <carlprit> :P
[09:39:56] <carlprit> That's why I'm here rly
[09:40:16] <carlprit> To rewrite it
[09:40:18] <carlprit> Any ideas?
[09:41:49] <tman> hightekvagabond ill try
[09:42:36] <hightekvagabond> carlpritâ€¦. I'd start with the very first line of your function: change field=document.getElementById(fieldId);
[09:42:36] <hightekvagabond>  to be field=$('#' + fieldID);
[09:42:55] <hightekvagabond> and that is only if you still feel the need to use field
[09:43:52] <carlprit> hightekvagabond: Alright
[09:44:24] <tman> hightekvagabond: man that's messed, i can see the js working
[09:44:25] <hightekvagabond> as I dig through all my old code and replace it with jquery stuff, one of the things I look for as a clue that I need more jquery is the word "document.", any code that has document.blah in my old (prejquery code) gets cleaned up
[09:44:32] <tman> but the inspector is showing the td's greyed out
[09:44:36] <tman> refresh and check the console..
[09:44:46] <tman> they're all there, they are all the right height, but they're greyed out
[09:45:52] <hightekvagabond> I wonder if the container is getting resized in there somewhere and forcing it down on you
[09:46:41] <hightekvagabond> yeah, inspector says height of container is 220px
[09:46:52] <hightekvagabond> it's container that is squeezing it, not the cells
[09:47:36] <hightekvagabond> hopefully someone else can help you from here, I'm gonna get flogged if I don't load myself into the car to go to "board game day"â€¦ good luck
[09:49:15] <tman> kk

[10:14:46] <y3di> im trying to select all the elements under the child-node element that have the class child-link
[10:14:51] <nicholasschulz> how do i get the content of this div to stay inside / make a scrollbar? http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php
[10:14:54] <y3di> i tried  $('#child-node').find('.child-link')
[10:15:01] <y3di> but it doesnt seem to be working
[10:15:17] <y3di> any help?
[10:25:13] <whoever> hi all
[10:25:26] <whoever> i am tring to disable/enable a button
[10:26:32] <whoever> how come ("disabled","disabled")  will disable but ("disabled","true") will not ?
[10:27:32] <ravenzz> because true is a boolean
[10:27:34] <ravenzz> not a string
[10:27:47] <ravenzz> ('disabled', true) should work just fine
[10:29:24] <whoever> remysharp:  ok will give it a shot
[10:32:20] <smplstk> remysharp gets all the credit
[10:32:39] <smplstk> no love for ravenzz :(
[10:32:53] <mathi> hi
[10:33:01] <whoever> ravenzz: thx
[10:33:12] <mathi> I have one element in my html div.bookingsData
[10:33:25] <mathi> is this the best way to get that element? $(html).find('div.bookingsData').first();
[10:34:11] <Olorin-> $('.bookingsData:first')
[10:34:14] <whoever> mathi: so you just want to show or hide the div
[10:34:14] <ravenzz> i'll get drunk for this
[10:34:19] <ravenzz> whoever yw
[10:34:37] <smplstk> mathi: $( 'div.bookingsData' );
[10:34:48] <smplstk> if it's the only one, why :first or first() ?
[10:34:49] <mathi> no, html is a variable containing th html
[10:34:49] <whoever> mathi: sorry mis read
[10:35:35] <Olorin-> you said 'in my html', not in a variable
[10:35:51] <whoever> mathi: do you have other id's of "bookingdata"
[10:35:58] <mathi> no
[10:36:00] <whoever> or is that your only one
[10:36:15] <ravenzz> omit the "div" if the given class is for divs
[10:36:45] <smplstk> <whoever> mathi: do you have other id's of "bookingdata"
[10:36:48] <whoever> well then why not just (".bookingdata") no need for the div unless you plan on more boking data
[10:36:49] <smplstk> NEVER EVER
[10:37:03] <smplstk> ID's
[10:37:05] <erichynds> needs moar booking data
[10:37:22] <mathi> it's faster to specify the element when you use a class
[10:37:25] <mathi> div.myClass
[10:37:29] <whoever> smplstk: newer ever what
[10:37:50] <erichynds> naw, it's slower
[10:37:52] <smplstk> whoever: multiple id's on a page, but like, I don't even know where that came from
[10:37:58] <whoever> smplstk: id's are unique so why include the div,p.etc
[10:37:59] <smplstk> because he's using class'
[10:38:16] <mathi> it's faster to specify the element when using a class
[10:38:27] <erichynds> naw, it's slower
[10:38:31] <mathi> faster
[10:38:34] <erichynds> slower
[10:38:36] <smplstk> lol
[10:38:37] <Olorin-> l o l
[10:38:40] <mathi> faster
[10:38:42] <erichynds> NO U
[10:38:49] <whoever>  smplstk since id's are unique why include the tag
[10:38:55] <mathi> I won
[10:39:09] <erichynds> everyone wins on the internet
[10:39:26] <Olorin-> this conversation is retarded
[10:39:30] <whoever> smplstk: ah ... thx
[10:39:49] <smplstk> wait, I'm being thanked for something?
[10:39:51] <smplstk> I don't get it.
[10:41:05] <mathi> erichynds, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/46214/good-ways-to-improve-jquery-selector-performance
[10:41:12] <mathi> erichynds, http://www.componenthouse.com/article-19
[10:41:19] <erichynds> let me tell you why it's slwoer
[10:42:00] <mathi> erichynds, well I just tested on my browser
[10:42:06] <erichynds> sizzle, qsa, etc work from right to left. when you specify a tag name, it has to grab all elements, then filter out ones which match the tag name, rather than just grabbing all elements
[10:42:15] <erichynds> so there's an extra step there
[10:42:15] <mathi> p.myClass is faster than .myClass
[10:42:24] <ravenzz> http://jsperf.com/jquery-selector-speed-tests
[10:43:04] <smplstk> mathi: just 'testing' in your browser isn't exactly bullet proof.
[10:43:41] <erichynds> so it's faster in IE7/IE8
[10:43:46] <erichynds> but slower in every other browser
[10:43:48] <mathi> ravenzz, I have different results than this one: http://www.componenthouse.com/extra/jquery-analysis.html
[10:46:30] <smplstk> mathi: http://jsperf.com/erichyndsisrite
[10:46:40] <smplstk> best test case name EVAR
[10:46:44] <erichynds> ?cc
[10:46:44] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:48:00] <mathi> but in CSS styles I do have to specify the element right?
[10:49:28] <smplstk> mathi: no
[10:49:47] <mathi> I've been lied to for so many years?
[10:49:58] <smplstk> you _CAN_, but you don't _HAVE_ to
[10:50:19] <mathi> sure ..... we are in the context abour perforamnce
[10:50:34] <smplstk> lol, css perf tests
[10:50:44] <mathi> in CSS styles it's still faster to specify the element when using classes
[10:50:59] <mathi> uhm, it's a question
[10:51:16] <smplstk> mathi: in short, I haven't ever really looked into it.
[11:02:12] <ari5av> hi folks.  anyone around that can help me with an idea?  I need to dynamically add or remove a couple of elements, based on the value of an <input type="number" />
[11:02:28] <ari5av> the idea is here:  http://www.ari5av.com:9980/what.html
[11:02:59] <ari5av> should speak for itself how it should work
[11:05:51] <smplstk> ari5av: uh, wat?
[11:06:09] <smplstk> what action is meanth to _add_ elements to the page?
[11:06:18] <smplstk> *meant*
[11:09:00] <ari5av> whatever is the value of num_choices - that many sets of {one radio button and one text box}
[11:09:30] <ari5av> when num_choices changes, however many sets are there should reflect that change
[11:09:47] <ari5av> either drop a set from the end, or add a new set.
[11:11:03] <Olorin-> ari5av: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[11:11:05] <ari5av> if any are dropped from the end and the checked radio button is one of the ones dropped, the 0th radio button should check itself.
[11:11:58] <ari5av> Olorin-: I know to use .change() but what I'm trying to figure out is what should be the triggered effect :)
[11:13:20] <Olorin-> doesn't sound like a technical problem then
[11:14:27] <ari5av> right, this is a burned-out-coder issue. :)
[11:15:35] <y3di> im trying to select all the elements under the child-node element that have the class child-link
[11:15:53] <y3di>  i tried  $('#child-node').find('.child-link')
[11:15:59] <y3di>  but it doesnt seem to be working
[11:16:22] <Olorin-> ari5av: I wouldn't bother with letting the user specify the number of entries
[11:16:35] <Olorin-> but simply let them create and remove entries
[11:17:19] <ari5av> like, display one or two, and have an "add" button or something?
[11:17:37] <Olorin-> y3di: what about $('#child-node .child-link')
[11:17:43] <Olorin-> ari5av: yep
[11:18:05] <y3di> ill try it
[11:18:23] <ari5av> I can try that, but I'll have to run it by my PM, this is already an approved mockup :(
[11:18:45] <Olorin-> ah I see
[11:19:06] <Olorin-> well I as a user would find the add/remove entry approach more intuitive
[11:22:12] <ari5av> personally I agree.  also, not all browsers support <input type="number" />
[11:23:13] <poppiez> I've attached a fn to the "blur" event on an input field. is there any way to .trigger('blur'); without this function running and only the defaults? like a suppress: true param
[11:23:20] <ari5av> the point of this is that the end-user is building a survey, and for each question, there's a varying number of multiple choice answers
[11:24:10] <Olorin-> funnily enough, I had to do somethig similar with entries, which you can see at http://www.swook.net/p/cloudfront-invalidator.html in the 'submit' tab.
[11:27:18] <y3di> so is there a way to assign a click handler to elements that will be dynamically added to the dom?
[11:27:53] <solepixel> would someone mind looking at this script. I feel like I'm so close, but I can't figure out why it's breaking: http://dev.cmacvet.com/ (hover over carousel at the bottom)
[11:28:26] <solepixel> maybe i have my event wrong or something
[11:28:37] <solepixel> can't figure out how to make it keep scrolling while i'm hovered on top of it
[11:28:57] <solepixel> and i'm getting some easing errors too, could be part of the problem
[11:29:50] <smplstk> ari5av: http://jsfiddle.net/WD77g/2/
[11:29:57] <smplstk> lololol
[11:45:18] <netAction> Hi! I have a plugin that loads some data. After loading is finished I want to allow other plugins to use the data. As long as the data is not loaded the other plugins should wait. How does this work?
[12:21:43] <bjensen> umm do the builtt in jquery animations seam to be slower in firefox? Seams more glitchy
[12:24:13] <bjensen> no response..hmm that means temp02 is still on vacation ;-)
[12:24:38] <netAction> bjensen: Slower than what?
[12:25:21] <bjensen> chrome for example
[12:27:08] <smplstk> bjensen: everything is slower than chrome.
[12:27:26] <netAction> Yes it is slower. But it should be okay for simple and small animations.
[12:27:30] <bjensen> but its more glitchy
[12:27:58] <netAction> yes.
[12:28:12] <bjensen> blast
[12:29:21] <netAction> If you use setinterval other parts of your site can disturb the execution.
[12:29:43] <netAction> Does anyone know the difference between $.myPlugin() and $.fn.myPlugin() ?
[12:31:23] <systemfault> The same as between $.myPlugin and $.prototype.myPlugin
[12:33:03] <eric357> I keep getting an error on my javascript that I can't figure out.  The (really simple) code is here: http://pastebin.com/VezfRVj6pro
[12:33:48] <eric357> but Chrome keeps telling me "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input"
[12:33:54] <netAction> eric357: Unknown Paste ID!
[12:33:59] <eric357> oh
[12:37:14] <netAction> afk
[12:39:11] <eric357> that's weird - this one appears to work:  http://pastebin.com/XTcP6Qfb
[12:39:31] <eric357> anyway, real simple code and the error is flagged between line 1 and 2.
[12:41:46] <tw2113> would anyone know why this replace() is including a closing parenthesis on links?
[12:41:50] <tw2113> var t2 = text.replace(/(http|https)(:\/\/)([^ ]+)/ig, '<a href="$1$2$3">$1$2$3</a>' );
[12:42:39] <systemfault> holy s.
[12:45:27] <eric357> tw2113: Is there a closing paren in the input string?  It appears that ([^ ]+) would match a string that includes a closing paren
[12:45:40] <tw2113> yeah, there is
[12:46:14] <tw2113> would you happen to know what to change to exclude the ) ?
[12:46:15] <eric357> tw2113: How does it work when you change the last group to ([^ )]+)  ?
[12:46:37] <tw2113> it removes it :D
[12:46:40] <tw2113> thanks eric357
[12:46:50] <eric357> tw2113:  glad to help!
[12:47:51] <tw2113> something i should add to my "learn in 2012" list, regex
[12:52:07] <eric357> here's the odd thing, if I comment out the load of jquery I get the same error.  So, it's like jquery is not loading - but I SEE it in the network panel.
[13:06:08] <crazyzf> hi can someone help me by my big problem with ajax and the load function
[13:06:16] <crazyzf> here is my testsite: http://reativs.de/applicant/test

[13:07:26] <crazyzf> nothing will happen
[13:12:43] <crazyzf> the jquerycode u will find with firebug, under scripts dialogbox.js
[13:15:56] <joshsmith> if I have an img, is there any way that I can pull out just the filename instead of the full path from the src?
[13:17:45] <shadykhan> what is the best way to test and expand my jquery skill?
[13:18:55] <_xor> Hey guys
[13:19:59] <_xor> I'm looking at having some resolution-dependent style-sheet(s).  I want < IE 8 compatibility, so I'm wondering if I anyone here has experience with switching using jQuery or using a polyfill (Respond.js)?
[13:36:35] <mattis> hi, is it possible to make JQuery _not_ append charset=UTF-8 behind the Content-Type when I create an Ajax POST request?
[13:37:56] <systemfault> Well.. json is by definition utf-8 afaik.
[13:38:03] <systemfault> So.. it wouldn't make sense.
[13:38:38] <shadykhan> what is the best way to test and expand my jquery skill?
[13:39:34] <mattis> systemfault: I don't know why, but a REST service I'm consuming won't work if charset=UTF-8 is appended to the content type.
[13:40:07] <systemfault> wtf :/
[13:41:05] <mattis> systemfault: yeah, my though exacly
[13:46:58] <mikevankuik> I'm trying to occupy my odometer field with the value I'm trying to retrieve using the $_POST['VIN'] but I guess I need to do some jquery ajax magic and I've got no idea how this stuff worksâ€¦ any help plz? (php code ->http://pastebin.com/0M0TtG2Y HTML -> http://pastebin.com/3Az99cFj)
[13:48:59] <MoTiOnXml> having some trouble with widgets and _trigger() with custom data
[13:49:20] <MoTiOnXml> the docs says your "data" is wrapped in a $.Event object
[13:49:24] <MoTiOnXml> as originalEvent
[13:49:36] <MoTiOnXml> but i don't see that
[13:50:14] <MoTiOnXml> if I do $widget._trigger("drop", "string value") i don't receive "string value"
[13:51:34] <MoTiOnXml> hmm
[13:52:19] <MoTiOnXml> right, have to pass in type, original-event, then data
[13:52:21] <MoTiOnXml> solved
[13:52:26] <systemfault> create an Event.... fill it
[13:52:26] <MoTiOnXml> thanks ;)
[13:52:42] <MoTiOnXml> systemfault: just need to emit a string value as event, so all is good
[13:52:51] <systemfault> :)
[13:53:14] <mikevankuik> I'm trying to occupy my odometer field with the value I'm trying to retrieve using the $_POST['VIN'] but I guess I need to do some jquery ajax magic and I've got no idea how this stuff worksâ€¦ any help plz? (php code ->http://pastebin.com/0M0TtG2Y HTML -> http://pastebin.com/3Az99cFj)
[13:53:28] <nicholasschulz> Any way BETTER to do a chat? It probably is because I'm so new to jQuery. See code here: http://jsfiddle.net/spnMY/1/   See the chat in action here: http://annenetasje.com/area21/testdrive.php
[13:54:40] <mikevankuik> I'm not quite sure where to begin :) I'm loading the library in my html nowâ€¦ but what about then? how do I start the jquery magic?
[13:56:50] <gf3> mikevankuik: you have just won the "Least Specific Question" award for 2012
[13:57:35] <mikevankuik> gf3: cool :D does that entitle me to a rematch so I can explain it better and maybe if the question is specific enough a possible valid answer? :D
[13:58:35] <gf3> mikevankuik: maybe
[13:58:37] <gf3> nicholasschulz: https://github.com/maccman/holla
[14:01:54] <mikevankuik> I've got this VIN in my database. And to retrieve the highest odometer value I'm relying on the VIN and then use the MAX () function in my sql query. (as you may see in the code) that query works like a dream as long as I provide it with the $_POST['VIN'] <- this is where I need some jquery ajax magicâ€¦ but I don't understand it :) the jquery that is :)
[14:03:01] <mikevankuik> gf3: http://pastebin.com/0M0TtG2Y see how I use the $_POST['VIN'] ?  (quite simple but effective for what I want to retrieve)
[14:04:36] <mikevankuik> gf3: http://pastebin.com/3Az99cFj then on this page I'd like to use it. But I need some magic before the $_POST['VIN'] is occupied by a value. Because else it will be only occupied by a value after I've send the form. And that would result in a database entry and that's not what I'm after.
[14:05:16] <mikevankuik> At least not at that point. that should be later when all the variables have values.
[14:05:55] <gf3> mikevankuik: I don't understand why you need jquery, can't you just have a default value in PHP?
[14:06:53] <mikevankuik> gf3: no the value is going to change with every fuel ticket I'll be adding to it. So I've got to get the odometer information dynamically :)
[14:07:14] <mikevankuik> http://dev.solutiontribe.com/vrs/index.php here is the script at work :)
[14:08:25] <nicholasschulz> how do you make jquery scroll to the bottom of a div?
[14:08:36] <gf3> mikevankuik: so you'd like to pull in the VIN and use it in your form, before submission?
[14:08:45] <Eviltwin> nicholasschulz: Look at the scrollTo plugin?
[14:09:03] <Eviltwin> Or combine scrollTop, height, and innerHeight
[14:10:10] <mikevankuik> gf3: exactly :) have it present so I can use it in my sql query :) that should be run before the form is send too :) so it can fill the odometer with the highest know odometer value for that VIN :)
[14:10:23] <gf3> mikevankuik: you'll need to create a PHP endpoint to return the data, I recommend using JSON
[14:10:23] <gf3> mikevankuik: then you'll need this: http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.getJSON
[14:11:31] <gf3> mikevankuik: then once you have your data, you can set the VIN in your form with: http://jqapi.com/#p=val
[14:12:37] <Deafgoose> I have the following selector $("div[id^='post-'] div.entry-content").html() however inside div.entry-content theres a div.class that I would like to exclude from this selector, how would I go about doing this?
[14:14:04] <mikevankuik> gf3: so the first link should tell me how to create a json file that will contain the data I'm interested in? and the second will replace the data in the odometer field? (I'll still be able to edit that field won't I? because the thing is 9-10times just the last 3 numbers are going to be changed :) that's why I want that number to be retrieved :) saves a shitload of time entering data into the db :)
[14:15:25] <gf3> mikevankuik: the first link shows your how to GET your JSON file from your server
[14:15:43] <gf3> mikevankuik: the second shows you how to update your form
[14:16:00] <gf3> mikevankuik: you need to create the PHP script that will return the VIN as JSON
[14:16:43] <mikevankuik> gf3: ok :) that clears things up ^_^ thanx :D I'll have a google how to create a json file out of php then :)
[14:16:59] <Deafgoose> I have the following selector $("div[id^='post-'] div.entry-content").html() however inside div.entry-content theres a div.class that I would like to exclude from this selector, how would I go about doing this?
[14:17:10] <whoever> trying to enable a button and .attr("disabled", false); does not work,
[14:17:19] <gf3> ?g phpdoc json_encode @ mikevankuik
[14:17:20] <bot-t> mikevankuik, PHP-DOC #38680 [Opn->Ctl]: json_decode won't decode ... - http://marc.info/?l=phpdoc&m=115905728601124
[14:17:25] <gf3> well fuck
[14:17:38] <gf3> mikevankuik: http://ca2.php.net/json_encode
[14:21:15] <whoever> anyone? ^^ nore does .removeAttr
[14:23:32] <xxiao> ajax(){success:callback1,}; callback1{dosomething;setTimeout(callback1,30000)}; i want to wait 30 seconds between each ajax-async-callback1
[14:24:12] <xxiao> will this work? i.e. a func calls itself with setTimeout?
[14:29:09] <capoerista> !list
[14:31:29] <poppiez> doesn't "scroll" work with .live()?
[14:32:10] <y3di> so is there a way to assign a click handler to elements that will be dynamically added to the dom?
[14:32:13] <Deafgoose> I have the following selector $("div[id^='post-'] div.entry-content").html() however inside div.entry-content theres a div.class that I would like to exclude from this selector, how would I go about doing this?
[14:34:10] <MoTiOnXml> it's been a while since we heard from the UI team
[14:34:14] <MoTiOnXml> i wonder when 1.9 is out
[14:34:29] <MoTiOnXml> ajpiano blogged about some nice features for widgets
[14:36:13] <mikevankuik> gf3: can't I use $('select.foo option:selected').val();  <- got get the data from this option list I've got ? sounds a lot easier to meâ€¦ (haven't got it working so far though but seems easier anyway)
[14:38:19] <shadykhan> any good free online jquery books?
[14:38:59] <cheshair> Hi! I have a menu made up of expandable items. I would like to keep memory of expanded/collapsed items while the user is browsing through the website pages. Am I supposed to use cookies?
[14:39:15] <cheshair> Is that a reasonable solution?
[14:39:30] <bot-t> shadykhan, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[14:44:18] <cheshair> How am I supposed to use cookies with jQuery? jQuery cookies plugin seems a dead link at plugins.jquery.com. Am I missing something?
[14:50:21] <sk8ball> ches, plugins.jquery.com got accidentally deleted
[14:50:32] <sk8ball> they are starting a new plugin directory on github
[14:50:35] <sk8ball> i forget the ur
[14:50:45] <sk8ball> url*
[14:54:44] <cheshair> sk8ball, ah nice (the github part, not the deletion, of course!), thank you very much, I'll look for it

[15:15:06] <andywww> hi, i have inline script inside a number of divs, i want to get the class of the div that contains the script, how might i do this please?
[15:15:44] <Deafgoose> I have the following selector $("div[id^='post-'] div.entry-content").html() however inside div.entry-content theres a div.class that I would like to exclude from this selector, how would I go about doing this?
[15:16:31] <cheshair> Hi! I have a very simple snippet to build an expandable/collapsable menu http://dpaste.com/680049/ - I wish I could keep memory of expanded menu items. I think I could use cookies. How can I record things in a cookie? Should I add some id to each menu item?
[15:18:30] <yakup> hi,i can not reach the plugin site for it's under maintenance and i need the documentation for jquery-tagcloud-0.5.0 --- can i get it somewhere else?
[15:25:44] <andywww> i have inline javascript inside a div, i need to select the div which is holding the code with a selector how might i do this please?
[15:36:11] <xxiao> trying to use oneTime and setTimeout to call a function and it's totally unreliable
[15:37:00] <htrejh> hi
[15:37:18] <xxiao> neither one worked for me. i did an async-ajax call named ajax1, in the ajax1's callback function ajax1_callback
[15:37:45] <xxiao> i have setTimeout(ajax1,60000) which is supposed to call the ajax1 again
[15:37:51] <htrejh> i have a page with different divs, all with the same class defined, but each div has a unique id defined, i can hide all the divs using the class, but when i want to show a specific one using it's id with .show() it doesn't work
[15:37:54] <htrejh> is this normal?
[15:37:57] <xxiao> it's indeed called, but not at 60 seconds, instead it's random
[15:38:46] <xxiao> tried $(document).oneTime to set up the one shot timer, still the same, unreliable timer
[15:39:12] <xxiao> can I do something like this, inside ajax's callback, call ajax again?
[15:39:38] <xxiao> i want to make sure next ajax happens after a certain period of time from the previous ajax call
[15:40:08] <xxiao> note, i set up the timer at the _end_ of the ajax's callback, so by then the ajax should exit
[15:40:58] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[15:41:02] <Eviltwin> I missed most of that
[15:41:34] <Eviltwin> Let me read
[15:41:35] <donCams> hi... how do I use $ sign in any part of my javascript? I want to use it outside jQuery(function($){ });
[15:42:31] <Eviltwin> donCams: It's considered a best practice to use a (function($){...})(jQuery); wrapper for external files that may be included on a page with noConflict or another library that uses the $
[15:42:54] <Eviltwin> If you're certain the $ can be overwritten, you can use window.$ = window.jQuery;
[15:43:28] <donCams> thanks Eviltwin
[15:44:13] <htrejh> is it possible to hide all div using a class name, and show only one using its id? with .show() and .hide() ?
[15:45:29] <Eviltwin> htrejh: Can you explain further?
[15:45:55] <htrejh> maybe a visual will be better: http://http://classicrap.fr/videos/classic-videos
[15:46:28] <htrejh> those are all divs with class name "letter"
[15:46:30] <Eviltwin> So you have an ID, how does that relate to a class?
[15:46:33] <Eviltwin> Okay
[15:46:43] <htrejh> so i hide them all, that works
[15:47:02] <htrejh> and i want to show one specific using it's id with a onclick event
[15:47:27] <Eviltwin> Onclick from where?
[15:47:36] <mdel> $('.letter').hide(); $('#the_id').show(); ?
[15:47:44] <htrejh> it's a test
[15:47:52] <htrejh> i tried that
[15:47:57] <htrejh> and it doesn't work
[15:48:18] <mdel> htrejh: i would imagine there is something else going on, that should work
[15:48:24] <mdel> fiddle it
[15:48:29] <htrejh> i changed the javascript
[15:48:35] <htrejh> if you want to try
[15:48:59] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/uwNN2/
[15:49:01] <htrejh> now the js hides them all and should show "#letter-X"
[15:49:30] <Eviltwin> xxiao: Are you sure?
[15:49:46] <htrejh> this is in my ready function:
[15:49:48] <htrejh> 	$('.letter').hide(); 	$('#letter-X').show();
[15:50:03] <htrejh> they are hidden when you load the page, but letter-x doesn't show up
[15:50:29] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ htrejh
[15:50:30] <bot-t> htrejh, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[15:50:52] <htrejh> ok i'll do it, thanks
[15:51:58] <xxiao> Eviltwin: tried for the whole day
[15:52:07] <xxiao> Eviltwin: just can't get the timer under control

[16:41:26] <MoTiOnXml> is there a way to trigger a droppable to start listening, if created while the user is dragging an element?
[16:41:58] <MoTiOnXml> i'm creating a dynamic droppable, when the user starts dragging a draggable, but the (dynamic) droppable isn't registering drops
[16:42:22] <MoTiOnXml> i had the same issue with draggable and had to trigger draggable._mouseDown(e);
[16:42:38] <MoTiOnXml> i was wondering if there's sort of the same issue with droppable for dynamic droppables

[17:58:21] <mari00> Anyone here?
[18:10:38] <whoever> mari00: can you post to pastbn

[19:50:05] <muhoo> does jquery 1.7.1 not happen on android browsers?
[19:51:12] <pifantastic> muhoo: what do you mean "not happen"?
[19:51:56] <aple> Is it possible to put functions inside of $.animate, or does it only accept specific properties?
[19:52:11] <aple> For instance, I'd like to animate scrollTop. Any ideas?
[19:53:17] <pifantastic> aple: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[19:53:24] <pifantastic> search for "scrollTop" on that page
[20:00:43] <muhoo> pifantastic: any reason why this would not work on chrome on android/  http://prn.s3.amazonaws.com/hello_world0.1.html
[20:00:49] <muhoo> that div is supposed to read "javascript and jquery are running correctlly"
[20:01:11] <muhoo> appears not to work on chrome at all
[20:01:24] <pifantastic> muhoo: http://prn.s3.amazonaws.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js
[20:01:34] <pifantastic> That returns an Access Denied message for me
[20:02:39] <muhoo> pi try again?
[20:04:23] <muhoo> pifantastic: i'm sitting here right now, i'm running that link in FF7, it works, i try on my G2 android with chrome, and it does NOT work
[20:04:54] <aple> pifantastic: I can't seem to get it working, care to have a look? http://jsfiddle.net/BWDqL/
[20:06:20] <muhoo> huh, i think i have a clue why now
[20:06:26] <muhoo> here's what my browser reports:
[20:06:26] <muhoo> "Mozill
[20:06:26] <muhoo> a/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.2; en-us; VTAB1008 Build/GRH78C) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTM
[20:06:29] <muhoo> L, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1"
[20:06:32] <aple> muhoo: Try this instead: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[20:06:32] <muhoo> wait, what?
[20:06:52] <onykage> works fine on my android 2.3 running dolphin and the default browser
[20:07:07] <muhoo> onykage: thanks, i think i know why
[20:07:13] <muhoo> jquery DOES NOT LIKE it when a browser lies to it
[20:07:26] <muhoo> my browser is a lying sack of shit
[20:07:37] <muhoo> it is a linux machine running android, but it reports itself as an iphone
[20:07:42] <aple> Anyone care to help me figure out how to animate scrollLeft and Top? http://jsfiddle.net/BWDqL/
[20:07:43] <pifantastic> muhoo: use a different variable name other than 'status'
[20:07:47] <onykage> says "This shows that the HTML is working"
[20:07:49] <muhoo>  Mobile Safari/533.1
[20:07:57] <muhoo> onykage: that means it is broken
[20:08:08] <muhoo> it should show "javascript is working" oor "vanvas above is black"
[20:08:14] <muhoo> pifantastic: hmm, why?
[20:08:24] <pifantastic> muhoo: it looks like chrome defines window.status
[20:08:26] <pifantastic> or something
[20:08:34] <muhoo> ooh, interesting
[20:08:35] <pifantastic> if I use a different variable name it works
[20:08:38] <pifantastic> very odd
[20:08:41] <muhoo> fantastic, thanks
[20:08:48] <muhoo> pifantastic: thank you VERY much!
[20:08:55] <muhoo> wtf, magic div id's???!
[20:09:01] <muhoo> thanks google, really. thanks
[20:09:30] <onykage> can any of you chaps help me figure out how to pass a 2d json array to an auto complete?
[20:09:44] <pifantastic> muhoo: if you use "var status"
[20:09:46] <pifantastic> i bet it works
[20:09:55] <pifantastic> and you should use "var" anywats
[20:09:58] <pifantastic> anyways*
[20:10:15] <pifantastic> muhoo: javascript scoping is tricky
[20:10:34] <onykage> glad im still learning to crawl over here
[20:10:37] <onykage> heh
[20:16:41] <onykage> http://www.pastie.org/3110268
[20:17:06] <onykage> can anyone tell me how to pass a 2d json object to the autocomplete?
[20:18:15] <onykage> i found a few examples but people used local arrays, not a json object
[20:18:52] <onykage> im trying to have a select from the autocomplete pass a hidden item id back to a load function
[20:19:26] <ngharo> the docs have remote examples.. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
[20:20:59] <pifantastic> onykage: the JSON should look like this: https://gist.github.com/1549332
[20:21:41] <onykage> whoa so i need 3 keys per element?
[20:21:50] <onykage> thats very helpful thank you
[20:21:58] <onykage> i thought i only needed 2
[20:23:40] <mike817> i have a function in an external script file. can i access it from an in page script?
[20:24:33] <pifantastic> mike817: yes
[20:25:08] <mike817> that's what i thought, guess something else is wrong.
[20:25:09] <mike817> thanks!
[20:25:57] <cudi> sapnin wit everyone
[20:26:44] <onykage> pifantastic dude i love you.  I was doing it right the array was wrong
[20:26:58] <onykage> would never have figured that out
[20:27:10] <pifantastic> onykage: np
[20:27:25] <JoeCoder> Hello.  Javascript errors loaded in scripts on an ajax page are not being reported:  https://gist.github.com/1549338
[20:27:26] <pifantastic> mike817: the function in the external script has to be "in scope"
[20:27:50] <mike817> it should be
[20:27:54] <mike817> i think at least
[20:27:55] <JoeCoder> If I move the throw Error('test'); to ajax.html, then the error is reported in chrome and firefox's console.
[20:28:06] <pifantastic> mike817: and is the external script loading first?
[20:28:35] <mike817> yeah. called through a script tag, the another script tag with my code
[20:28:56] <mike817> both scripts within $(document)ready()
[20:29:14] <pifantastic> mike817: in that case they are not in the same scope
[20:29:58] <mike817> oh ok. i thought all document.ready's were in the same scopr
[20:31:03] <pifantastic> mike817: http://jsfiddle.net/zjBx5/
[20:33:21] <JoeCoder> nested functions aren't visible outside of the function where they're defined.
[20:33:26] <JoeCoder> your call to foo can't see the foo function
[20:33:30] <pifantastic> exactly
[20:33:37] <pifantastic> I'm demonstrating this to mike817
[20:33:43] <JoeCoder> sorry, came in late.
[20:36:07] <mike817> is there a way to make the function global?
[20:36:48] <JoeCoder> yes, don't wrap it inside the jquery document ready code.
[20:37:02] <mike817> heh   that would make sense
[20:37:09] <JoeCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/wHnWY/
[20:37:36] <JoeCoder> it's odd.  jquery is so ubiquitous, people learn it before learning javascript.
[20:37:46] <JoeCoder> I used js for 10 years before jquery existed!
[20:51:49] <aldenie> Hey gang, could someone please respond to let me know if my connection is working?
[20:51:59] <JoeCoder> I hear you
[20:52:17] <JoeCoder> your connection seems to be working

[22:30:27] <donCams> how do I choose to remove only the li  that contains the clicked link? i actually have $(this).parents('li').remove(); btw
[22:37:41] <Zauberfisch> donCams try $().closest()
[22:38:12] <Zauberfisch> but that might also get children
[22:38:18] <Zauberfisch> not sure
[23:03:35] <_Tristan> hey, is there a room just for jquery ui?

[23:06:56] <_Tristan> well ok
[23:12:17] <_Tristan> oh. I had an old version of jQuery... I guess that was the problem.
[23:14:59] <_Tristan> nevermind, not the problem. http://jsfiddle.net/8vBPP/
[23:16:52] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/8vBPP/1/
[23:21:40] <_Tristan> cool. Unfortunately it didn't work when it was changed in the larger project.
[23:22:50] <Eviltwin> Not really sure what I'm supposed to do about that
[23:26:00] <_Tristan> well, me neither, 'cause I just put the whole project in jsfiddle and it worked great

[23:56:32] <p3rsist> Hi guys. I use animate on a div and then I fade it out. After that I relaunch the same animation but nothing is appearing... This is the code: $('#container').animate({"bottom": "+=100px"}, "medium").animate({"bottom": "-=100px"}, "medium").delay(3000).fadeOut(2000);
[23:56:41] <p3rsist> What is the problem?
[23:57:22] <p3rsist> The first time I run it works well. After that, everytime I re-run the animation, it doesnt animate...
