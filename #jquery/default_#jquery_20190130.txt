[11:45:43] <djbozzz> Hey all, do you use any state management conventions from React/Redux? Like single state object that is updated?
[13:06:46] <denisbr> Hi People, I have an iframe, where the source is a pdf page. I´have in the PDF embbed a javascript for display print option, for the user to print the pdf page... Can I send the print direct to default printer?
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> Wrong channel - you want ##javascript :)
[13:08:38] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, ok... I´m sorry
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> it's alright :)
[15:33:57] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[16:12:37] <sshine> I'd like to get an array of value attributes for the checkboxes I've selected.
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> use .map().get() for that.
[16:13:47] <sshine> right now I'm doing $("input[type='checkbox']:checked").map((i, e) => $(e).val()). what do I stick inside .map()?
[16:14:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't - you need .get() afterwards.
[16:14:30] <bunny3> get()[0] is the way to get a newly created dom element?
[16:14:42] <bunny3> wondering if there's something neater
[16:15:09] <robertmaxrees> bunny3 did you read the docs?
[16:15:11] <sshine> robertmaxrees, so... $("...:checked").map().get() with no arguments? provides a "Cannot read property 'call' of undefined"
[16:15:18] <bunny3> robertmaxrees: that's where I got it from
[16:15:37] <robertmaxrees> sshine i mean you use your map and add the .get()
[16:15:44] <robertmaxrees> bunny3 https://api.jquery.com/get/#get-index
[16:15:50] <robertmaxrees> bunny3 you can do .get(0)
[16:16:30] <bunny3> I will do so then.
[16:17:08] <robertmaxrees> sshine https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/og2x3tsd/
[16:17:16] <sshine> robertmaxrees, okay, so my current use of .map() is kind of wrong, I think: it seems that I need both (i, e), and for some reason I need $(e) to get access to .val(). are you saying I should do: $("...").map((i, e) => e).get()?
[16:17:32] <robertmaxrees> sshine no
[16:17:39] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle i just shared.
[16:17:48] <sshine> okay, so I wasn't doing something wrong when I did $(e).val(). felt like it.
[16:17:53] <sshine> thanks.
[16:18:18] <robertmaxrees> sshine that's pretty standard.  you COULD just do e.value instead of $(e).val(), but that depends on some factors.
[16:21:37] <sshine> robertmaxrees, I'll take it. :) thanks.
[16:42:57] <Caspan> If i have a listener listining to 4 different ellements i.class1, i.class2, i.class3, i.class4 is there a way to tell what one it fired on in the function after words so i can make some logic?
[16:43:58] <Caspan> its the same code for each element but the function it fires is different so i need to know on what element they clicked unless i add the type to the data- attribure of the element?
[16:44:06] <robertmaxrees> wait
[16:44:21] <robertmaxrees> "it's the same code" -> "the function it fires is different"
[16:44:23] <robertmaxrees> so which is it lol
[16:44:36] <Caspan> well there is a whole bunch of data gathering code
[16:44:40] <Caspan> that is all the same
[16:44:51] <robertmaxrees> so really - you have some shared logic and then some separate logic.
[16:44:54] <Caspan> but if you clicked edit or assign, or delete
[16:44:59] <Caspan> correct
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> I'd invert your thinking
[16:45:08] <Caspan> ok
[16:45:22] <robertmaxrees> pull everything into functions, then bind individually to the separate classes./
[16:45:38] <Caspan> humm
[16:45:44] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:46:03] <Caspan> so write a function to go get the data and call each one of those functions.. gotcha
[16:46:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:46:14] <robertmaxrees> nono
[16:47:14] <Caspan> no?
[16:47:20] <Caspan> sorry thought that is what you ment
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.

[16:50:53] <Caspan> ohh thats more advanced
[16:50:59] <Caspan> lol have to figure out whats going on here
[16:51:08] <robertmaxrees> it's super basic.
[16:51:49] <Caspan> yeah just not used to doing this.. have to understand the loci to follow it
[16:51:50] <Caspan> reading

[17:03:25] <robertmaxrees> really?
[17:03:33] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 don't paste like that in the channel
[17:03:45] <jak2000> sorry
[17:03:59] <jak2000> i pasted, for sample , but understand
[17:04:45] <robertmaxrees> don't paste code in the channel.
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[17:05:09] <jak2000> this the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/cuk7L8he/
[17:05:23] <jak2000> this string i get error parsererror  SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 13
[17:05:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't see an error in that fiddle.
[17:05:28] <jak2000> not see the error :(
[17:05:37] <jak2000> i returned from server...
[17:05:45] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:06:06] <jak2000> the value of: xhtmlLN  is generated in server...
[17:06:19] <robertmaxrees> i don't see how that relates to anything in the fiddle.
[17:07:53] <jak2000> wich is the position 13?
[17:08:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> share the json in a fiddle or something.
[17:08:17] <robertmaxrees> at least do that much.
[17:08:19] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/cuk7L8he/1/   see the error: error parsererror  SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 13   any advice why? not dound the error...
[17:08:35] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:08:51] <robertmaxrees> first off - slow down.
[17:09:08] <robertmaxrees> second off - put the JSON object in the "javascript" box.  assign a var to it.
[17:09:43] <jak2000> ok
[17:10:54] <robertmaxrees> and then save it and send the fiddle over.
[17:11:13] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/cuk7L8he/5/
[17:11:29] <robertmaxrees> okay so next
[17:11:41] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing with that JSON in your code?
[17:12:06] <jak2000> when i do a ajax callback.. and server return this json,
[17:12:23] <jak2000> i asiggn to a div.. (the value) but fail, because this error: error parsererror  SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 13   any advice why? not dound the error...
[17:12:32] <jak2000> and dont see wich is the error... :(
[17:12:32] <robertmaxrees> slowwww dowwwwwn
[17:12:44] <jak2000> :)
[17:12:48] <robertmaxrees> so what happens if you remove any callbacks?  just do the ajax call.
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> does the error still happen?
[17:13:56] * wfpkhc wanders on in
[17:14:12] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 ?
[17:14:42] <wfpkhc> hello - can anyone recommend a jquery image scroller like cycle 2? but one that is responsive? - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> so you want a responsive version of cycle 2?
[17:15:22] <robertmaxrees> wfpkhc
[17:15:24] <wfpkhc> well any image slider
[17:15:31] <wfpkhc> that is easy to implement
[17:15:50] <wfpkhc> that is responsible - possibly one with the ability to change the image slider to a lightbox
[17:16:05] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/kDcgaHu.png
[17:16:06] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:16:12] <robertmaxrees> it says it's responsive
[17:16:25] <wfpkhc> but it doesnt work for some reason for me
[17:16:36] <robertmaxrees> so why don't we try to fix that?
[17:16:48] <wfpkhc> i have spent 3 weeks trying to fix it :P
[17:16:55] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:17:06] <wfpkhc> i will try that
[17:17:08] <wfpkhc> and come back
[17:17:10] <wfpkhc> thank you si r
[17:17:20] * wfpkhc wanders off

[17:17:37] <jak2000> asigned to a div...
[17:17:47] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what did i ask?
[17:18:05] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> what are you doing with that JSON in your code?
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> after that
[17:18:26] <robertmaxrees> "so what happens if you remove any callbacks?  just do the ajax call."
[17:20:15] <jak2000> i start pasting my ajax... in a fiddle
[17:20:23] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:20:47] <robertmaxrees> so... if you just do the ajax call without any callbacks, do you still get the error?
[17:21:09] <robertmaxrees> if something about that question is confusion, let me know what it is.
[17:21:45] <jak2000> i call ajax: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/cuk7L8he/13/
[17:21:47] <robertmaxrees> *confusing
[17:21:50] <jak2000> something like that
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> so for a third time
[17:21:58] <jak2000> its correct?
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> if you just do the ajax call without any callbacks, do you still get the error?
[17:22:30] <jak2000> sorry sorry not understand....
[17:22:38] <robertmaxrees> so where are you confused?
[17:22:38] <jak2000> how to do a ajax whitout callback
[17:22:41] <jak2000> googling
[17:22:47] <robertmaxrees> remove the .done() and .fail()
[17:23:08] <robertmaxrees> just do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lk8cojgw/
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> so what happens when you just have ^
[17:25:35] <jak2000> error
[17:25:41] <jak2000> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[17:25:49] <jak2000> need define a jquery library right?
[17:25:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:25:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean on your site.
[17:26:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove the .done() and .fail() calls on your site and see if the error still happens without them.
[17:26:54] <jak2000> ok
[17:26:56] <jak2000> testing
[17:28:45] <jak2000> running the project
[17:31:57] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:33:29] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:34:49] <jak2000> NO ERROR
[17:34:51] <jak2000> sorry for caps
[17:34:52] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:35:02] <jak2000> checked console and its clear.
[17:35:25] <robertmaxrees> and the ajax call is still firing?  you checked your network tab?
[17:35:59] <jak2000> ith no callback network tab is clear(green)
[17:36:17] <robertmaxrees> and with the callbacks is that request not green"?
[17:36:43] <jak2000> checking...
[17:37:05] <robertmaxrees> you didn't check any of this before???
[17:38:08] <jak2000> network tab not
[17:38:16] <jak2000> only console... and source.
[17:41:42] <jak2000> continue clear the netwok.. tab
[17:41:52] <robertmaxrees> but now you're getting the js error?
[17:41:59] <jak2000> yes
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what do you think you'd do next?
[17:43:10] <robertmaxrees> to troubleshoot, i mean.
[17:43:19] <jak2000> console and network card s clear
[17:43:23] <robertmaxrees> cool
[17:43:39] <robertmaxrees> wait so the console is fine now with what you had before?
[17:46:04] <jak2000> in the console i displayed the error...
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> so you're getting the error again?
[17:46:16] <jak2000> yes
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what do you think you'd do next to troubleshoot?
[17:46:35] <jak2000> i show the error in  an alert
[17:46:42] <jak2000> i think the problem is in server side..
[17:46:48] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[17:47:08] <robertmaxrees> try remove dataType: 'json' btw
[17:47:29] <robertmaxrees> *removing
[17:48:18] <jak2000> ok
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:51:24] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 did that fix it
[17:51:25] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:53:40] <robertmaxrees> long dev cycle just to test little changes.
[17:53:49] <robertmaxrees> surprised you're not just doing it via the console
[17:54:50] <jak2000> runnning the project
[17:54:53] <jak2000> a moment please
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> heh - you should be able to get a copy of the object once and then just do everthing via your dev tools (shrug)
[18:00:42] <jak2000> no error
[18:00:50] <robertmaxrees> wihtout the dataType ?
[18:00:58] <jak2000> but see the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/ztL8jao4/3/
[18:01:09] <jak2000> give me a output and json
[18:01:09] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:01:16] <jak2000> i think ...
[18:01:17] <jak2000> wait
[18:01:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:02:36] <jak2000> in other time, i get a error, because returned a json, but also printed html code ...
[18:02:46] <robertmaxrees> not making sense.
[18:03:01] <jak2000> something like that: out.print("<br>"); <---- generate the error, but now, havent any html printed..
[18:03:18] <robertmaxrees> you've completely lost me.
[18:03:38] <jak2000> sorry,, i am bad to explain
[18:03:53] <jak2000> ok uis ebtter construct an object and return the object (not the html table)
[18:04:01] <jak2000> sorry
[18:04:08] <jak2000> ok  is better construct an object and return the object (not the html table)
[18:04:39] <robertmaxrees> >.> 'kay.
[18:04:46] <robertmaxrees> still not entirely sure about what's going on lol
[18:07:09] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 here, do this: https://github.com/ajpiano/fixingthesejquery
[18:07:27] <robertmaxrees> clone this repo, then navigate to it and select "index.html"
[18:07:34] <robertmaxrees> and give it a read.
[18:10:21] <MACscr> ok, so ive found this sweet little plugin for creating managing "tags" or in my case, just comma separated values. The problem I have found from a UX perspective is that you cant easily copy elements that are there using the normal highlight all method that someone would do typically with the right click menu or ctrl+a on the keyboard, etc, then copy.  What do you think would be the best way to do this without adding a destroy
[18:10:21] <MACscr>  button? https://jsfiddle.net/3pw8kugh/
[18:12:59] <robertmaxrees> MACscr eeeehhh
[18:13:57] <robertmaxrees> you're gonna have a hard time without doing some kind of hack.
[18:39:15] <MACscr> robertparkerx i think you are right. I think im going to try to see if i can put a button at the end textarea instead. https://jsfiddle.net/mzrchf35/1/
[18:39:17] <MACscr> almost there
[18:39:20] <MACscr> lol
[18:39:29] <MACscr> more a css issue at this point i guess
[18:41:34] <MACscr> probably going to have to make some bigger markup changes to make that work. oh well
[18:46:23] <MACscr> robertparkerx got it https://jsfiddle.net/mzrchf35/3/
[18:46:34] <MACscr> not ideal, but not the worst either
[18:54:23] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thanks friend
[18:54:32] <jak2000> solved the problem double quotes...
[18:54:34] <jak2000> problem
[18:54:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:54:48] <robertmaxrees> still not even clear what the issue was lol
[18:56:59] <jak2000> double quote en the json...
[18:57:09] <robertmaxrees> i'll believe you
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[18:58:55] <jak2000> thanks
[18:58:56] <jak2000> much thanks
[18:59:24] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[19:08:00] <MACscr> hmm, so i think im using prev() wrong here. im not getting the textarea right before the button im clicking. Wrong use for this? https://jsfiddle.net/MACscr/mzrchf35/5/
[19:08:39] <robertmaxrees> i assume you want the prior .tag-editor-field, right?
[19:08:47] <MACscr> yes
[19:09:00] <robertmaxrees> .prev() just grabs the prior sibling always.
[19:09:20] <MACscr> but it is a prior sibling isnt it?
[19:09:25] <robertmaxrees> the selector is a filter - it won't grab that immediate sibling if it doesn't match the selector.
[19:09:32] <robertmaxrees> sorry - prior *immediate* sibling
[19:09:37] <MACscr> oh, i need prevAll
[19:09:49] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[19:10:02] <MACscr> worked
[19:10:09] <MACscr> but is there a better way to do it?
[19:10:45] <robertmaxrees> prevAll will grab, well, all.
[19:10:51] <robertmaxrees> try it with more than 2 :)
[19:11:20] <MACscr> there wrong every be more than one sibling with that class
[19:11:22] <robertmaxrees> usually a recursive function that repeatedly calls .prev() using the former return of .prev()
[19:11:32] <robertmaxrees> huh??
[19:11:50] <MACscr> er, there wont be another sibling every with that class
[19:11:54] <MACscr> ever
[19:11:56] <MACscr> lol, i cant type
[19:12:10] <robertmaxrees> oh wait.
[19:12:19] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was way off.
[19:12:20] <MACscr> each group would be wrapped in its own input-wrapper
[19:12:24] <robertmaxrees> use .closest().find()
[19:12:31] <robertmaxrees> instead of relying on them being actual siblings.
[19:12:51] <robertmaxrees> that way you can move markup around but this will still workj.
[19:12:52] <robertmaxrees> *work
[19:12:57] <MACscr> not a bad idea. thanks
[19:13:25] <robertmaxrees> also: store the result of $(this) in a var so you don't have to keep calling $(this)
[19:13:53] <robertmaxrees> and 'target' is already a jquery obkect - $(target).tagEditor('destroy'); can just be target.tagEditor('destroy')
[19:16:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/djobur3w/6/
[19:28:16] <foo> Is there a preappendto equivalent instead of appendto ?
[19:28:33] <robertmaxrees> "preappend"???
[19:28:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean "prepend?
[19:28:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prependto/
[19:28:46] <foo> oh. prependTo ... just saw it, heh
[19:28:47] <foo> thank you robertmaxrees

[23:14:15] <gf3> if you want to *wrap* that thing in a list you can do:
[23:14:15] <gf3> $("#gform_fields_83 .gform_column_start").wrap("<ul />")
[23:14:24] <gf3> https://api.jquery.com/wrap/#wrap-wrappingElement
[23:14:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[23:15:08] <GeekMonkey> I want to wrap where gform_column_start to gform_column_end
[23:16:00] <robertmaxrees> you just wanna pop those lis into a UL, right?
[23:16:10] <GeekMonkey> ya
[23:16:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[23:16:38] <GeekMonkey> it is a ul with several li's
[23:16:48] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[23:17:45] <robertmaxrees> why not just do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b86c0hLa/1/ ?
[23:17:52] <gf3> you'll need to also wrap the correct elements in a `li`
[23:18:31] <GeekMonkey> https://pastebin.com/zBF4kG7q
[23:18:47] <GeekMonkey> this gives you an idea
[23:19:00] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[23:19:10] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do this client-side and not server-side?
[23:19:36] <GeekMonkey> gravity forms and yoast xml are conflicting with each other
[23:19:46] <robertmaxrees> so you want to fix it client-side?
[23:19:47] <GeekMonkey> I have it working server side but it breaks the xml
[23:19:50] <robertmaxrees> :|
[23:20:03] <GeekMonkey> so I need to do it client side
[23:20:19] <GeekMonkey> it is just a temp solution as we are building a new site
[23:20:35] <GeekMonkey> but the form can't be broken till then
[23:20:44] <gf3> can you show us the befor/after state?
[23:20:47] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to build out some kind of recursive next() setup.
[23:20:49] <gf3> *before
[23:21:08] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll have to do some weird selecting to get things by index.
[23:24:05] <GeekMonkey> https://pastebin.com/Y9ZY386L
[23:24:23] <robertmaxrees> your end result is invalid btw.
[23:25:45] <gf3> he's right :( the only valid child of a <ul> is an <li>
[23:26:00] <gf3> you may want to consider replacing the parent <ul> with a <div>
[23:26:15] <GeekMonkey> https://pastebin.com/27Kx4CVX
[23:26:29] <GeekMonkey> can you have a div inside a ul?
[23:26:30] <robertmaxrees> yikes lol
[23:26:44] <robertmaxrees> the only valid child of <ul> is <li>
[23:26:56] <robertmaxrees> *direct child, that is.
[23:27:43] <GeekMonkey> ya... not sure why you said it was invalid the first tim
[23:27:47] <GeekMonkey> anyways\
[23:27:50] <GeekMonkey> it was quick
[23:28:13] <robertmaxrees> because you had a <ul> as a direct child of <ul>
[23:28:16] <robertmaxrees> which you can't do :)
[23:28:23] <GeekMonkey> what would I need to do to get the right reselt for columns
[23:28:36] <robertmaxrees> do these even need to be in LIs at this point?
[23:28:57] <robertmaxrees> like what if you just pulled the contents out and did something a little different?
[23:29:10] <GeekMonkey> ya gravity forms does each field in an li but if we changed it that is fine
[23:29:46] <robertmaxrees> so what you you went fromt the two ULs to just putting the contents of the <li>s into whatever makes sense?
[23:29:49] <robertmaxrees> that OK?
[23:29:56] <robertmaxrees> or do you really need to do that weird grouping?
[23:32:44] <GeekMonkey> I want to make two columns based on the start and end of the li's
[23:33:18] <GeekMonkey> or do two columns and have the first 5 in one columns and the last 3 in the other column
[23:33:44] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you're looking at a function doing recursive next() calls.
[23:35:18] <GeekMonkey> can you help with that/
[23:36:30] <gf3> GeekMonkey: https://jsfiddle.net/chL8e3rv/
[23:37:09] <robertmaxrees> :/
[23:37:26] <robertmaxrees> was hoping they'd get a chance to learn to do it themselves.
[23:38:22] <gf3> nextUntil() to the rescue
[23:38:23] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey did you want to include the start/end lis, or just what's between them?
[23:40:36] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[23:41:10] <GeekMonkey> I think he got it
[23:41:20] <robertmaxrees> rip this channel
[23:41:45] <gf3> free software, am i right? thanks richard stallman
[23:41:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[23:42:04] <robertmaxrees> just bums me out that people keep giving away answers like that.
[23:42:05] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[23:42:13] <gf3> my bad
[23:42:22] <robertmaxrees> meh.
[23:42:24] <gf3> this is my first time back on IRC in like 5 years
[23:42:27] <gf3> i got excited
[23:42:55] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/ fwiw
[23:43:01] <robertmaxrees> but thanks :)
[23:45:50] <GeekMonkey> I am still not through the woods yet robertmaxrees
[23:46:09] <gf3> the first one's free, pal
[23:46:11] <GeekMonkey> I do not want to append but replace the contents
[23:46:23] <gf3> this time it'll cost you.....
[23:46:51] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey that's fine.
[23:46:57] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what the fiddle is doing so far?
[23:50:02] <robertmaxrees> because long story short, you just need to make a small tweak.
[23:54:08] <GeekMonkey> I think so
[23:54:28] <GeekMonkey> element in between start and end it appends to container
[23:55:02] <GeekMonkey> removes the contents
[23:58:14] <GeekMonkey> I just added this after the each function
[23:58:14] <GeekMonkey> $(".column_start").remove();
[23:58:14] <GeekMonkey>   $(".column_end").remove();
[23:59:56] <gf3> GeekMonkey: is there anythin useful left in the original <ul>?
