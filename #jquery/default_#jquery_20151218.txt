[00:23:10] <shibly> If there is any form submit, grab that form, how can i do it?
[00:25:47] <akshayvishnoi> You can add jquery event on form submission. You wil get form element in that block as `this`.
[00:29:04] <shibly> Are you talking about this? ('form').on('submit',function(e){.. ?
[00:31:13] <shibly> akshayvishnoi: ^
[00:32:41] <akshayvishnoi> yup….. a small correction - $(‘form’).on(…
[01:06:26] <Uhkis> where's the correction O_O
[01:29:04] <Cork> Uhkis: the missing $
[01:30:25] <Uhkis> Cork: ah, clearly coffee deprivation
[01:48:24] <Trinity> is it possible to print out an object's css style through jquery?
[01:48:31] <Trinity> print it out as a string or in json format
[01:49:32] <Cork> Trinity: window.getComputedStyle(elm)
[01:50:55] <arc_> that's javascript, so you can't pass a jquery object to it afaik
[01:51:02] <Cork> nope
[01:51:10] <Cork> arc_: btw everything is javascript
[01:51:14] <arc_> you may already know that but i figured i may as well mention it :p
[01:51:18] <arc_> yeah i know : / you know what i mean
[01:51:23] <Cork> it is native dom functions though
[01:51:27] <Cork> i think that is what you meant
[01:51:36] <arc_> i meant non-jquery javascript
[01:51:44] <Cork> no it isn't
[01:51:49] <Cork> it is dom not javascript
[01:52:01] <arc_> hm, ok
[01:52:23] <arc_> i did not realize that was a separate language from javascript
[01:52:42] <Cork> arc_: it isn't a separate language
[01:52:46] <Cork> but it isn't part of javascript
[01:52:58] <arc_> so what would you call it
[01:53:03] <Cork> dom is a completely separate specification from javascript
[01:53:07] <Cork> just like html and css is
[01:53:12] <Cork> "dom"
[01:53:32] <arc_> i mean if it's not a language what is it
[01:53:32] <Cork> arc_: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/
[01:53:40] <Cork> a specification
[01:53:54] <Cork> language is syntax, specification is a set of functions
[01:54:00] <arc_> ok
[01:54:14] <Trinity> Cork, console is returning, [object CSS2Properties]
[01:54:29] <Cork> the reason the distinction matters is that just cause something supports javascript doesn't mean it supports dom
[01:54:36] <Cork> mongodb is a good example
[01:54:53] <Cork> Trinity: ya, you can check it as an object though
[01:54:55] <Trinity> nvmd
[01:55:00] <Trinity> got it thanks
[01:57:35] <Trinity> Cork, sorry but is there a way to get a list of all applied css styles?
[01:57:47] <Trinity> right now I can do getPropertyValue("width"); to query for them individually
[01:58:04] <Trinity> is there a function that will give me an array or list of applied css properties?
[01:58:30] <Cork> Trinity: uh
[01:58:36] <Cork> just use it as an object
[01:58:42] <Cork> you don't need getPropertyValue
[01:59:04] <Trinity> ah you're right
[01:59:08] <Cork> ex. window.getComputedStyle($('body')[0]).width
[01:59:17] <Cork> heck even JSON.strinfify(window.getComputedStyle($('body')[0])) works
[02:08:03] <Uhkis> JSON.stringify works better :-)
[02:08:16] <Cork> it doesn't change much
[02:08:31] <Cork> that same things works with the original object
[02:08:50] <Cork> (and that is why serialize works)
[02:08:52] <Uhkis> corrected a typo ;)
[02:09:54] <Trinity> Cork, thanks for the help I really appreciate it
[02:10:19] <Trinity> i'm using JSON.stringify right now and it's returning everything back as name/value pairs
[02:10:51] <Trinity> i'd like to get all applied css on an element'
[02:13:37] <Cork> Trinity: it returns the original object as a string
[02:13:48] <Cork> Trinity: that is the only thing JSON.stringify does here
[02:14:10] <Cork> the exact same key value pair exist in the original object
[02:14:30] <Cork> depending on your developer tools it might be displayed in different ways though
[02:15:13] <Cork> Trinity: my point is doing something horrible like JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(window.getComputedStyle())) is completely unneeded
[02:28:37] <Uhkis> hmm, how to select all text in a page? $('body').children().each(function() { $(this).text() }); ?
[02:33:59] <Uhkis> oh, find is more suitable
[02:40:09] <kevireilly> Uhkis: I'm not sure how well it works in comparison, but another approach $('*').text();
[02:49:30] <shibly> Hi, anyone there?
[02:50:15] <shibly> Object[form] ;, how can i access/get the form?
[02:50:29] <shibly> console.log($(this));
[02:50:37] <shibly> console.log($(this));Object[form] ;
[03:37:52] <km4> hi, have the problem http://pastie.org/10639393 work on chrome, dont work in firefox
[03:39:23] <km4> sessionStorage ruined this function ;/
[03:53:30] <shibly> https://jsfiddle.net/9c0ntmtL/ , do i have to use .parents() or .closest() to get the upper first form(because there can be other forms)?
[03:56:26] <Cork> shibly: closest()
[03:56:39] <Cork> shibly: also note you can't nest forms
[03:57:20] <shibly> Cork: Yes.
[03:58:03] <shibly> 		//var frm = $(this).parent("form")[0];
[03:58:20] <shibly> and 		var frm = $(this).closest("form")[0];
[03:58:27] <shibly> output same
[03:58:45] <shibly> Cork: ^
[03:58:53] <Cork> parent only checks if the immediate parent is matching the selector
[03:59:21] <Cork> so <form><div><input> if this is input $(this),parent('form')[0] == null
[03:59:38] <Cork> while closest is the form
[04:00:13] <Cork> parents does the same thing as closest, except it returns all matching parents instead of just the closest parent
[04:00:36] <Cork> so when ppl use parents it is almost always a mistake
[04:00:46] <shibly> I didn't understand your example of .parent()
[04:01:26] <Cork> shibly: <form><div><input></div></form> $('input').on('click', function() { $(this).parent('form').length === 0 });
[04:02:30] <Cork> shibly: https://jsfiddle.net/rm9jqntx/
[04:03:24] <shibly> Where would you get console here? https://jsfiddle.net/rm9jqntx/
[04:03:35] <shibly> Is there any console in jsfiddle?
[04:03:40] <Cork> in the browsers developer tools
[04:05:00] <shibly> Why === instead of == ?
[04:05:13] <Cork> no realy reason
[04:05:20] <Cork> you can take it as the same thing
[04:07:27] <shibly> Cork: But in my case why are the same outputs?
[04:07:41] <Cork> shibly: cause parent of the input is the form
[04:08:01] <Cork> the filter in parent()  "give me the parent if it matches, else give me nothing"
[04:08:18] <Cork> while in closest it is "find the closest parent matching the selector"
[04:08:45] <Cork> notice that there is no "find" in .partent()
[04:09:23] <Cork> shibly: parent('div') would return the div in that example though
[04:09:49] <Cork> shibly: basically, there is rarely a point in giving .parent() a selector
[04:10:38] <km4> Cork: its fine when I add some localStorage.setItem('foo', 'show') and I use localStorage.getItem('foo') ? I dont need the value. I need only look if key exsist then ... ?
[04:24:13] <shibly> Where is jquery good over plain javascript?
[04:25:11] <skcin7> Quick question. In my app,          $(this).closest("tr").hide(1000);          works perfectly.       However,     var closest_tr = $(this).closest("tr"); closest_tr.hide(1000);   does not work.   Why?
[04:25:35] <hellyeah> i dont know about answer but someone told me yesterday using javascript on data manipulation is wiser choice then using jquery
[04:25:52] <shibly> skcin7: Use jsfiddle.net to post your code and example
[04:25:54] <hellyeah> skcin7: did you fiddle?
[04:25:56] <skcin7> The hide(1000) part only works on the first example.   But if I put table_row into a separate variable and try to hide() on a new line, it doesn't work
[04:26:21] <skcin7> It's a simple question, this shouldn't need a fiddle.
[04:27:05] <hellyeah> people can answer you better it is your call of course
[04:27:16] <hellyeah> what does your console say?
[04:27:23] <hellyeah> is there any error?
[04:27:33] <skcin7> Console shows nothing. There's no errors.
[04:28:40] <skcin7> Was thinking it was something silly and easy that I'm doing wrong.
[04:29:23] <hellyeah> if you prepare a jsfiddle example people can answer you better
[04:30:22] <hellyeah> may be hide function does not work with variable
[04:30:29] <skcin7> I think it's a variable scoping error, because I have the 2nd line being done in an if statement like so:
[04:30:52] <skcin7> http://pastebin.com/SD56KqVb
[04:31:59] <skcin7> If I put the closest_tr.hide(1000) on the line directly below where I select the table row, it works. But inside the if statement (as shown in the paste), it has no effect.
[04:32:23] <hellyeah> site is not accesible here
[04:32:51] <skcin7> Ok let me set up a fiddle
[04:34:34] <hellyeah> i cannot guarantee to answer you but i am sure Cork will answe you :)
[04:35:45] <Cork> skcin7: are you sure the rest of the code executes?
[04:36:03] <Cork> ex console.log(data.deleted == true)
[04:36:43] <Cork> skcin7: also you're not using this in that code example
[04:37:19] <skcin7> Cork what do you mean?
[04:37:20] <skcin7> What should I use?
[04:37:32] <Cork> skcin7: i can't tell what you should use, there are no context
[04:37:57] <Cork> is this ran inside an ajax call, a click event or what?
[04:39:19] <skcin7> It's run in the 'success' callback callback function of a $.ajax request.
[04:39:21] <likecolacola> var rows = $('<td>'); // is it possible to add an eventListener to that td?
[04:39:31] <Cork> likecolacola: sure
[04:39:43] <Cork> likecolacola: also rows != td :)
[04:39:50] <Cork> that would be cell
[04:39:58] <likecolacola> oh, yes, a cell :D
[04:40:04] <likecolacola> code got mixed hehe
[04:42:30] <likecolacola> I have already tried many ways, before appending it, after appending it.. giving an ID to the table and then doing $('#table-id').on('click', 'td-id', function() { console.log('hello'); }
[04:43:25] <Cork> likecolacola: just bind a static $('table').on('click', 'td', function(event) {});
[04:43:38] <Cork> then you can handle the different tds in that event handler
[04:43:46] <Cork> you don't need to add new ones as you add more cells
[04:44:26] <Cork> likecolacola: if i is just a specific column you want use a class on that columns instead
[04:44:46] <likecolacola> oh, the problem is that this api generate some conent which is returned at the end, I wonder if that's what's giving problems
[04:44:55] <likecolacola> content*
[04:45:31] <likecolacola> every cell needs to have a different function
[04:52:36] <skcin7> Maybe this can give you guys some idea/context of my problem: https://jsfiddle.net/skcin7/2Lp07dk3/5/
[04:53:23] <skcin7> However, the code in the JSFiddle is working fine.  But on my local machine, the hide(1000) isn't working.    I'm not sure why it's working in the JSFiddle and not on my computer.
[04:55:19] <skcin7> If I put the closest_tr.hide(1000) directly after the "var closest_tr = " line, the script works. However, if I move it inside the if statement, it doesn't work, and I have no idea why.
[04:55:59] <skcin7> Any ideas or insight, highly appreciated!
[05:10:58] <skcin7> Here's another weird thing. It seems that $("#some_checkbox").val() is always returning the value "on" whether it's checked or not.
[05:11:48] <skcin7> I know online is saying to use $("#some_checkbox").is(":checked") , but it's still weird to me that .val() is always returning "on".
[05:19:39] <Cork> skcin7: checkboxes doesn't work like that
[05:19:54] <Cork> skcin7: the value on a checkbox is what should be send if the checkbox is checked
[05:20:12] <Cork> skcin7: nothing is sent if the checkbox isn't checked
[05:20:35] <Cork> skcin7: if you in js want to check the state you need to check .prop('checked')
[05:20:49] <hassoon> what's the link of that documentation page about teh delegated events again you guys? i forgot it
[05:21:05] <Cork> hassoon: check in api.jquery.comn
[05:21:06] <hassoon> i mean binding event handlers to dynamically-added events
[05:21:09] <Cork> *api.jquery.com
[05:23:25] <skcin7> Cork - https://jsfiddle.net/skcin7/2Lp07dk3/7/
[05:23:45] <skcin7> The checkbox value is "on" regardless of if it's checked or not.
[05:23:50] <skcin7> That's desired behavior?
[05:24:06] <Cork> it is expected behavior ya
[05:24:13] <Cork> like i said up there
[05:24:43] <Cork> skcin7: also don't use alert for debugging
[05:26:56] <Cork> skcin7: https://jsfiddle.net/2Lp07dk3/8/
[05:27:50] <pavs> anyone familiar with smokeping?
[05:28:19] <skcin7> Cork - .prop("checked") is better than using is(":checked") ?
[05:28:55] <Cork> skcin7: yes it is
[05:29:19] <Cork> .is makes a .querySelector search and then checks if the current element is in the match
[05:29:29] <Cork> while .prop('checked') just does elm.checked
[05:29:56] <skcin7> Cool. Thanks for that clarifications.
[05:30:03] <skcin7> I will use .prop("checked") now
[05:30:07] <likecolacola> Cork: thanks for the hints, I did what you said
[05:30:23] <skcin7> They both seem to be returning a boolean which is what I want.    But based on what you said it makes sense that .prop is a bit faster.
[05:31:00] <Cork> quite a bit, actually, though it normally doesn't matter
[05:31:21] <Cork> but as it is a small change and is at least as readable
[05:31:30] <Cork> i see no reason not to push ppl to go that direction
[05:31:44] <Cork> the worst case i know is $(this).is(':checked')
[05:31:50] <Cork> THAT one always makes me cry...
[05:31:57] <Cork> (why not just use this.checked...)
[05:32:56] <skcin7> When searching Google for help most of the pages say to use .is(":checked")
[05:33:03] <skcin7> So that's why people are likely using it a lot
[05:33:19] <brk> Hi guys, I have this little snippet http://pastebin.com/ChpfN35r and I get an error in the console saying the specified value does not conform to the required format yyyy-MM-dd. Why won't it allow me to change it?
[05:33:33] <skcin7> But why the results from Google searching say to use that, is anybody's guess. :/ :/
[05:33:41] <Uhkis> skcin7: so you're saying google results are full of bad practise
[05:33:50] <skcin7> I'm not defending it
[05:34:11] <Cork> skcin7: most likely cause the pages you find is SO, and it SUCKS for info about jquery
[05:34:12] <skcin7> Yes Google is full of bad practice. Which is why talking it over with peers is always a good idea. =)
[05:34:18] <Buck> brk: do you have a link to the live page?
[05:34:30] <skcin7> Cork - #truth
[05:34:46] <brk> Buck, no sorry :/
[05:35:10] <Uhkis> hey, at least SO has the "-1 not enough jquery" joke in it :D
[05:35:12] <brk> I see posts about changing the format but that seems to mostly be for datepickers.
[05:35:27] <brk> I'm using the type="date", not sure if it's the same.
[05:41:27] <skcin7> Cork - I just tested sending checkbox values to a server using a regular form submit. The server receives it as "on" (if checked) or "" (_nothing_ if unchecked - not sure if that's an empty string or a null)
[05:42:09] <skcin7> So it's weird that when sending checkbox values to the server using Ajax to handle it differently.
[05:42:50] <skcin7> Right now sending a checkbox value to the server using $.ajax the value is true or false.     But with traditional HTTP Form submits it seems to be "on" or "".
[05:43:45] <skcin7> This is with using the .prop("checked") method that you recommended, which seems to be a good way to do it.
[05:43:50] <skcin7> So I'm stuck / concerned.
[05:44:27] <skcin7> Not stuck - just concerned that I should have to watch out and have a server handle checkboxes 2 different ways depending on the way the data is sent to the server.
[05:52:29] <skcin7> I guess i can do something like this: .prop("checked") ? "on" : null;     to replicate how checkboxes are sent to the server via a standard HTTP Form submission.
[05:56:55] <skcin7> Checkbox behavior is weird!
[05:57:08] <printForever> HALP!
[05:58:33] <printForever> I'm trying to determine how to check the position of the button in the sidebar
[05:58:34] <printForever> https://www.veebimajutus.ee/domeeni-registreerimine/?domain=zumbalumba&tld=ee
[05:58:49] <printForever> its the button with "Hind käibemaksuga:" text
[05:58:56] <printForever> it says Ei or Jah
[05:59:18] <printForever> there are no ID's or CLASSes changed when the button is pressed
[05:59:44] <printForever> well, there are no ID's or CLASSes used for either button being Ei or Jah
[06:00:02] <printForever> when it's pressed, I can catch that, that's not a problem
[06:00:12] <printForever> problem is determining its starting value
[06:00:20] <km4> if(localStorage && localStorage.getItem('hide_help')) whis is fine ?
[06:00:54] <km4> or better if I use localStorage.key('hide_help'){}
[06:00:54] <km4> ?
[06:01:20] <printForever> I tried using .val() and .text() but both were undefined
[06:01:29] <printForever> first was undefined, second was empty
[06:03:32] <printForever> any ideas?
[06:04:25] <km4> printForever: your code ?
[06:04:39] <printForever> km4, I've posted it at 11:58
[06:06:29] <Uhkis> printForever: $('#my-toggle-switch')[0].checked;
[06:07:09] <printForever> ok...
[06:07:10] <printForever> but...
[06:07:13] <printForever> its not a checkbox
[06:07:38] <Uhkis> it is.
[06:07:45] <km4>     content: "Jah"; and Ei add in css after and before
[06:08:31] <printForever> Uhkis, I tried $("toggle-switch-switch")[0].checked; it returns nothing
[06:08:39] <printForever> undefined
[06:08:51] <printForever> km4, yes it is, I know
[06:08:53] <Uhkis> printForever: i already gave you the working code
[06:09:12] <printForever> aaaaah!
[06:09:19] <printForever> Uhkis, OMG! :D
[06:09:29] <printForever> thanks buddy!
[06:09:32] <printForever> what did I miss?
[06:09:44] <printForever> aaaaaaaaaaaaa now I see it
[06:09:46] <Uhkis> there's a hidden checkbox
[06:09:51] <printForever> riiiight
[06:09:59] <printForever> still haven't woken up
[06:10:09] <printForever> thanks! :)
[06:10:12] <Uhkis> at 13:10? damn :D
[06:10:15] <printForever> I've totally missed that
[06:10:22] <printForever> its 12:10 here
[06:10:26] <printForever> and I got up at 9:30
[06:10:34] <Uhkis> oh, assumed estonia
[06:10:44] <printForever> from time to time, yes
[06:10:46] <printForever> not today :)
[06:23:12] <Cork> Uhkis: prop('checked') is normally nicer then [0].checked
[06:23:34] <Cork> (does exactly the same thing)
[06:25:40] <entux> hi. i´m trying to find a selector that returns the first input box after a specifix text. i got a software that generates a bunch of generic names for my input fields and i can only give them a certain Text lable,
[06:26:03] <Cork> entux: you should never base selectors on text in the document
[06:26:23] <Cork> the dom isn't built to do that efficiently
[06:26:29] <Cork> so it is a bad idea
[06:26:32] <entux> well... i dont have much of a choice. is this possible at all?
[06:26:48] <Cork> barely
[06:26:53] <entux> though so
[06:27:01] <Cork> you would have to select all input elements
[06:27:20] <Cork> then drop down to nodes (below elements) and loop over all text nodes before the input
[06:27:27] <Cork> and see if one of them has the text you care about
[06:27:37] <entux> mhm
[06:27:40] <Cork> so ya, not a good idea
[06:28:30] <Cork> so, you can filter based on it, but you can't do it with selectors
[06:28:47] <Cork> and the filter is very inefficient
[06:29:05] <printForever> Cork: I ended up using $('#my-toggle-switch').is(':checked')
[06:29:15] <Cork> printForever: why?
[06:29:28] <Cork> entux: if you make a jsfiddle of the dom structure you need to work with i could give you a hand trying to find a cleaner solution
[06:29:43] <Cork> $('#my-toggle-switch').is(':checked') === $('#my-toggle-switch').prop('checked')
[06:29:55] <printForever> it was more logical to me...
[06:30:02] <Cork> they both do the same thing, only difference is the amount of work the former has to do to check the same thing
[06:30:37] <Cork> printForever: then you need to look into how the dom works
[06:30:55] <Cork> cause if that is more logical you have a gap in your knowledge
[06:32:58] <entux> Cork: my problem is, that people can basically create arbitrary input fields and those are numbered like ´input_1´ ,´input_2´. its easier to tell those people that a field with the name ´myfield´ is required rather then tell them to always make myfield the first field they have to create. to fix it you´d need to tamper with the database entries...its all quite impractical.
[06:32:59] <Cork> printForever: what .is(':checked') does is $('*').filter(this).length > 0
[06:33:12] <Cork> i hope that explains why it isn't really a good idea
[06:33:15] <printForever> Cork, understood. Still, it works...
[06:33:28] <Cork> ... what ever...
[06:34:10] <Uhkis> Cork: you had one = too much up there
[06:35:18] <Uhkis> also pretty hilarious that this was just discussed and it took less than an hour to come up again
[06:36:56] <Cork> Uhkis: no as both returns boolean
[06:37:22] <Cork> Uhkis: it is the same conversation, i took it with him before
[06:38:49] <Uhkis> Cork: i meant that as == they do the same thing, but !== because they work differently
[06:39:20] <Cork> ya, i meant it as "they give you exactly the same response"
[06:39:46] <Cork> only difference is that one has to loop the dom elements while the other just fetches a value it already has...
[06:41:55] <printForever> Cork, Uhkis, will there be any performance drop and when?
[06:42:00] <Cork> yes
[06:42:14] <Cork> depending on how often the code runs it might not matter though
[06:43:32] <Cork> printForever: https://jsperf.com/prop-vs-ischecked/5
[06:43:43] <Cork> so .is() is 5x slower then .prop()
[06:43:51] <entux> in my case performance is practically irrelevant
[06:44:30] <stvn> hi, can use find() and attr() together?
[06:44:30] <Cork> entux: there are other ways to get around that
[06:44:41] <Cork> stvn: uh, "yes"?
[06:44:47] <Cork> though what are you trying to do?
[06:45:17] <Cork> entux: also it isn't just that is will take a lot of time to do the selection
[06:45:23] <Uhkis> my ugly one for printForever was fastest! :D
[06:45:43] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, that kinda surprises me actually
[06:46:01] <Cork> entux: it also means you will have to add quite a bit of code, and the selection will be fragile
[06:46:45] <Cork> Uhkis: hmm, that one uses a very old jquery though
[06:46:56] <entux> Cork: if you have a bettetr idea how to go about this im all ears (eyes)
[06:47:12] <Cork> entux: can't give you one without seeing the structure
[06:47:32] <stvn> sorry for the interrupt, trying to grab the value of the href attribute of an element <a>
[06:48:03] <Cork> stvn: $('a').first().attr('href')
[06:48:05] <entux> Cork: i´m trying... cant figure out how to give it to you. would the website itself be ok?
[06:48:15] <Cork> entux: it would
[06:50:50] <entux> Cork: https://giftcard.brain-behind.com/en/register -> i´m trying to select latitdude and longitude to fill the values in via google maps coords.
[06:52:08] <Cork> entux: you could add a class to label or the input field
[06:53:16] <Uhkis> Cork: added 4 divs before that and ops/sec dropped by over 100k, huge difference with even small dom size difference
[06:53:17] <entux> Cork: you mean in the code? i could check for the lable and add a class/id depending on the lable... hmm. good idea.
[06:53:47] <printForever> Cork, as entux said, also in my case there is 0 impact on performance
[06:53:54] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, i know, also jquery 2 makes a big difference (/92)
[06:54:22] <entux> Cork: ok i´ll probaly just do that. thx.
[06:54:59] <Cork> entux: an option (that will break if you ever translate the page) could be $('label').filter(function(){ return /^(Latitude|Longitude):/.test($(this).text()) }).next()
[06:55:05] <Cork> but i really would recommend a class
[06:56:08] <entux> yeah no... i think i´l just add it to the razor code
[06:56:32] <entux> thank you
[06:56:37] <Cork> np
[07:34:36] <hellyeah> hey
[07:35:33] <hellyeah> what i wonder is can i show a text within textbox if the input box empty when you click submit. I want to do an effect that placeholder does? https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/38/
[07:40:31] <multi_io> when storing single DOM elements (e.g. divs) in data structures for passing them around in your program, do you generally store the single element or the corresponding one-element jquery nodeset?
[07:43:38] <shibly> Do i need to send data as "nm_hidden_post_id=1&nm_comment_content=abcd" this format all the time with $.ajax() ?
[07:43:49] <shibly> params format
[07:44:35] <shibly> This is the output of $('form').serialize()
[07:46:06] <shibly> What are the available data formats to send with $.ajax() ?
[07:46:17] <shibly> to send form data
[07:46:37] <shibly> Cork: ^?
[09:14:35] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to add a scroll effect and it is conflicting with my active menu highlighting and navbar navigation. We're using Laravel (for our framework), bootstrap, and scroll magic js. Fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/h9zqhmr4/
[09:23:04] <Eburitus> can i put ID for ol/ul so that i would targed known list?
[09:23:17] <hellyeah> hey
[09:23:19] <hellyeah> i did background color of input box yellow but when i changed the value i expect to see background-color "not yellow". How can i do that? http://jsfiddle.net/bJMHC/7/
[09:24:29] <Eburitus> nvm. found solution.
[09:25:03] <taplar> hellyeah: your basing your style off of the attribute.  unless you change it, that won't change
[09:31:58] <entux> hi. if i got an input field with the class ¨textbox A¨, how would i go about it to select that? i have tried $(¨input.textbox A¨) without success :/
[09:32:15] <taplar> .textbox.A
[09:32:26] <entux> ah. trying that
[09:32:49] <taplar> if your wanting to do a logical and you leave out spaces
[09:33:13] <islalobo> Anyone want to take a look at my fiddle: Fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/h9zqhmr4/
[09:34:12] <entux> taplar: thata worked. thx.
[09:40:14] <taplar> islalobo:there's an error in the console when you click the link
[09:41:41] <islalobo> taplar: are you referring to the warnings?
[09:41:49] <islalobo> 'true has no effect'
[09:41:58] <taplar> no
[09:42:10] <taplar> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[09:43:28] <islalobo> taplar: I don't see that error. I've seen that error, but I'm not seeing it now
[09:43:47] <islalobo> Is there a console for jsfiddle other than using browser web tools?
[09:44:20] <taplar> nope
[09:44:36] <taplar> i'm seeing it in my browser console when i click the Brand link at the top left
[09:44:38] <islalobo> k I'm not seeing that error
[09:45:12] <islalobo> Oh, don't click that link. I just want to figure out the conflict between the scroll js and the active menu js
[09:46:18] <taplar> what conflict are you referring to?
[09:50:25] <islalobo> taplar: the scroll js conflicts with the active menu js so that the menu items do not have the active class added when you scroll over them. As well, with the scroll js you can't  click on the menu items and land on the different sections
[09:51:19] <islalobo> active class is add/removed to all menu items when you scroll on the first section panel
[10:00:14] <taplar> so for me it looks like it is adding and removing the active class to all links, not individually
[10:02:30] <taplar> which is what you said
[10:07:45] <islalobo> taplar: yeah, if I remove the scroll magic js the active menu item is added as you scroll/click to different sections
[10:11:53] <rfr> I have this form http://pastebin.com/UEhvATw0 which is basically a a dynamic checkbox list with a column structure of [checkbox] blah, blah, blah, [numberic input field with name set by a variable]. I am told that jquery is the only way to get it to do what I need which is to make the the checkbox required if the numberic input field is filled out. However, I have no idea where I would start. Does anyone know how I would achieve this? Tha
[10:24:31] <taplar> rfr:take a look at http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/ .  it should be possible to conditionally require a field based on another field
[10:25:04] <taplar> if i remember correctly
[10:25:05] <taplar> http://jqueryvalidation.org/required-method
[10:25:23] <taplar> but instead of giving it a static true/false you'd give it a method that it would execute that would return the true or false
[10:26:33] <taplar> or you could write some custom logic on submit if you didn't want to use that library
[10:36:30] <rfr> Thanks taplar: I will check it out.
[12:08:38] <islalobo> Scroll Magic js is making our active menu items add/remove class all at once rather than as the user scrolls/clicks through each section: https://jsfiddle.net/h9zqhmr4/1/
[12:09:30] <robertmaxrees> what's with all the other code?
[12:10:48] <islalobo> hrm? do you mean the min.css I included? It helps me see the menu as the user scrolls
[12:12:02] <robertmaxrees> i mean all the event bindings and stuff - just trying to understnad what's related and what isn't.
[12:15:56] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: everything under // Scroll Magic deals with transitioning between sections/panels and then the rest is to get the navbar elements to add/remove class as user scrolls/clicks
[12:16:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9zqhmr4/2/ this seems to work fine.
[12:17:39] <robertmaxrees> oh you're saying there's a conflict between the two?
[12:18:32] <islalobo> Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what scroll magic is doing that prevents the menu from acting (the way it does in the link you just posted)
[12:18:57] <islalobo> I'm not married to scroll magic and I'm looking at different libraries including one I just saw fullpage.js
[12:19:22] <robertmaxrees> you're reselecting elements on scroll.
[12:19:45] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet if you looked up positions and stored them statically, things would work correctly.
[12:20:05] <robertmaxrees> var refElement = $(currLink.attr("href")); is really slow inside of a scroll event handler anyway.
[12:20:16] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: looked them up when I'm doing the 'scroll magic'?
[12:20:38] <robertmaxrees> store that info beforehand.
[12:20:56] <robertmaxrees> scrollmagic looks like it's moving where elements are on the page and messing with your detection.
[12:25:16] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: would I use offset() to do that?
[12:25:22] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:25:39] <robertmaxrees> what about what i'm saying isn't clear?
[12:25:46] <robertmaxrees> the core of what you're doing is correct.
[12:26:05] <robertmaxrees> but instead of manually selecting elements within the scroll handler, you need to store that information ahead of time.
[12:26:15] <robertmaxrees> so you get the position of elements before you initialize that plugin.
[12:26:20] <islalobo> 'look up positions and store them statically' to look up the positions I have to get the position of each element?
[12:26:40] <robertmaxrees> you're already getting that information.
[12:26:53] <robertmaxrees> you just need to store it ahead of time instead of running the lookup on scroll.
[12:28:42] <islalobo> so instead of .on("scroll") how could I store it ahead of time?
[12:30:29] <robertmaxrees> run that logic within onScroll, but instead of doing your add/remove class logic there, put that information into an array or object.
[12:31:32] <robertmaxrees> you could do an array of objects that are something like {element: $thejqueryobject, position: the topPosition}
[12:34:04] <islalobo> so instead of refElement I have an array of objects?
[12:36:32] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to look up the right element out of that array instead.
[12:39:41] <islalobo> to search I would use .grep()? and …to set the elements, I'm not sure how to set their positions
[12:40:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd use .filteR()
[12:40:13] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean by "i'm not sure how to set their positions"?
[12:40:53] <islalobo> not sure how to set the objects in the array, i'm assuming I'm getting the position of each section id
[12:42:25] <islalobo> var refElement = $("section.panel").filter();
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:43:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm apparently not explaining something here ;)
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9zqhmr4/3/ islalobo
[12:51:16] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: and that position will help me with scroll magic?
[12:51:35] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what the issue is?
[12:52:23] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I can see the issue, but don't understand where the issue is. Is it because I'm getting all slides in scroll magic?
[12:52:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9zqhmr4/4/
[12:52:33] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:52:40] <robertmaxrees> scroll that and watch your console.
[12:53:51] <robertmaxrees> now look at this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9zqhmr4/5/
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> see the problem now?
[12:56:00] <islalobo> it's much more concise now
[12:58:24] <islalobo> But I'm not clear on how this relates to the issue with scroll magic. Should I change the refElement to lookup the offSetInfo rather than have it looking at the currLink.attr?
[12:58:42] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that you're selecting elements in the scroll handler.
[12:59:00] <robertmaxrees> by the time you're running your lookup, it's too late - scrollmagic has already broken the positioning info of all the elements.
[13:00:06] <robertmaxrees> so you need to store that position info when the page loads, and then initialize scrollmagic.
[13:00:14] <robertmaxrees> that way you have the original position of each element.
[13:02:39] <islalobo> is it stored now that the offsetInfo variable is there?
[13:02:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you think?
[13:03:45] <islalobo> I think yes, but I'm uncertain where to go from here
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> now you look through that array for the element you want.
[13:04:31] <robertmaxrees> and actaully, you don't even need the full element, just the class and the offset.
[13:04:39] <robertmaxrees> rather, the ID.
[13:04:43] <islalobo> in the onScroll function or for scroll magic
[13:04:50] <robertmaxrees> ignore scroll magic.
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> the issue is not inside of scroll magic.
[13:05:01] <robertmaxrees> the issue has everything to do with your scroll listener.
[13:05:39] <islalobo> okay, so this is refElement, I'm looking through the array for the element we want (the id)
[13:06:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9zqhmr4/6/ yeah i'd use this instead
[13:08:26] <robertmaxrees> oh you have that .height call in there.
[13:08:35] <robertmaxrees> so yeah go back to using the elements instead of the ID like before
[13:11:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h9zqhmr4/7/
[13:11:31] <robertmaxrees> so you now have something like this.
[13:17:00] <islalobo> currentObject?
[13:17:21] <islalobo> I'm seeing this in the console Object {element: n.fn.init[1], position: 0}
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> right.  what are you confused by?
[13:18:25] <islalobo> It's just that it's still not working so I'm trying to understand where the issue is. I don't see where currentObject is defined
[13:18:44] <robertmaxrees> it's passed to the filter.
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to fix it for you.
[13:18:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm showing you how to fix it.
[13:19:17] <islalobo> I'm just trying to understand what you're showing me so I can fix it
[13:19:34] <islalobo> So I don't need to define currentObject?
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> so what are you not understanding?
[13:19:39] <robertmaxrees> it's already defined.
[13:20:03] <islalobo> Is it a place holder in this example?
[13:20:09] <robertmaxrees> it's the actual element.
[13:20:56] <islalobo> and it doesn't have to be defined?
[13:21:02] <robertmaxrees> it IS defined.
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> do you not understand how arguments work with functions?
[13:22:43] <islalobo> no I understand that fine, I'm just seeing a similar issue as before and I don't understand what direction to take this
[13:22:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to fix it for you.
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm showing you how to fix it.
[13:23:05] <islalobo> I'm not asking you to, I'm trying to fully get my head around it
[13:23:24] <robertmaxrees> okay, so where are you now stuck?
[13:23:39] <robertmaxrees> right now you have a reference to the element thats currently visible.
[13:24:16] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:24:45] <islalobo> so am i now adding logic for the add/remove class?
[13:24:52] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:25:01] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[14:41:32] <jgornick> Hey folks, is there a way to trigger an ajax error when the request was successful but the content was invalid?
[14:41:39] <robertmaxrees> define "invalid"?
[14:42:35] <jgornick> robertmaxrees: My response code is a 200, but there's a JSON response with a property called "status" and a value of "failed". I want to cause that ajax request to fail if I see that.
[14:43:46] <robertmaxrees> then you should probably throw an error code from your server in that case - $.ajax() only follows a done/fail based on the actualy validity of the data.
[14:43:53] <robertmaxrees> you're sending back valid data.
[14:44:07] <jgornick> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I don't control the server, that's the issue.
[14:44:17] <robertmaxrees> then you can't meet an error condition.
[14:44:25] <robertmaxrees> because the $.ajax() request succeeded.
[14:45:27] <NoiseEee> jgornick: just put a post-ajax listener that checks for that 'error' message
[14:45:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check in your done() and fire the right logic,.
[14:46:06] <NoiseEee> if(is_valid(returnedResponse) { //its good } else { // oops and "error" }
[14:46:27] <NoiseEee> and i think jquery will let you define that 'is valid' function on  every xhr request with some code magic
[18:06:36] <DeafGoose> hey guys. what would be the best/easier template system would you recommend for jquery?
[18:17:11] <FilipNortic> DeafGoose: can't se why jquery would have a preference of template engines
[21:28:25] <veek> how do i clear default text from an input form element
[21:29:26] <veek> <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="XYZ" required></li>
[21:33:43] <flavored> can someone convert this to fat arrow (=>) for me, i kind of get it but not enitrely https://jsfiddle.net/xc259zzt/
[21:45:45] <flavored> plz its just 2 spots, short thing, but I'm not entirely sure how to do it ~
[21:53:49] <shoky_> flavored: https://jsfiddle.net/xc259zzt/1/  like this?
[21:54:17] <flavored> thanks, can the .bind be turned into fat arrow too?
[21:54:26] <flavored> in <span ..
[21:55:54] <shoky_> not really.  i mean it's possible but that'd just make it long and more confusing
[21:56:16] <shoky_> and you'd basically be implementing what .bind() already does for you
[21:56:39] <flavored> can you show me how it would look?  I'm really just trying to wrap my head around it, and need some before/after comparison
[21:57:14] <flavored> a "reaching" example would help see its limits, but thanks for first part!
[21:57:14] <shoky_> .bind returns a new function  that is the same as the original function, but "this" and optionally some arguments are already bound
[21:59:12] <shoky_> so   fn.bind(null, someArg)   is kind of like:  function(someArg) { return function(...args) { return fn(someArg, ...args); } }
[22:00:26] <shoky_> which in fat-arrow would i guess be-   someArg => (...args) => fn(someArg, ...args)
[22:00:34] <shoky_> like i said, more confusing
[22:00:39] <shoky_> no reason to do that
[22:01:07] <shoky_> and i'm also using the es6 arguments ... feature whatever its called
[22:01:41] <flavored> it helps me shown in real example because I see the parts and I can soak it in, reading non-connected examples doesn't really connect with me
[22:01:48] <flavored> but thanks for first part
[22:02:04] <shibly> https://jsfiddle.net/f52eudbg/ , is $.ajax() call valid in success: function(data){.. ?
[22:02:08] <shoky_> ok but trust me that for this specific second one you were asking, it wouldn't really give you mcuh to see
[22:02:29] <shibly> Can i call $.ajax() inside another $.ajax() ?
[22:02:35] <shoky_> shibly: yep
[22:02:44] <shibly> Inside success
[22:03:40] <shoky_> shibly: yeah it's perfectly ok.  one way to make the code look nicer is to give a name to your success function.  like:   $.ajax({..., success: onSuccess});  function onSuccess(data) { ...; $.ajax(...) }
[22:03:51] <shoky_> that way you don't have a gross pyramid looking code
[22:13:23] <shibly> Is it a valid line? var dv = frm.closest("div.cl_div_comment_container");
[22:15:32] <veek> is this likely to clear the form default text $('input[name ~= "name"]').on('click', function(event){ $('input').attr('value', '') });
[22:15:45] <veek> it's not working :p
[22:19:20] <veek> it works fine via console debugger though
[22:33:04] <shibly> Is it a valid line? var dv = frm.closest("div.cl_div_comment_container");
[22:39:15] <shibly> TypeError: frm.parents is not a function
[22:39:25] <shibly> var dv = frm.parents("div.cl_div_comment_container");
[22:39:27] <shibly> Why?
[22:44:05] <shoky_> shibly: it's valid  if frm is a jquery object
[22:44:46] <shoky_> if  frm is just a DOM element object, not wrapped in a jquery object, then it doesn't have jquery methods like  .closest or .parents  and you need to put a $() around it
[22:45:07] <shibly> It will be: var dv = $(frm).parents("div.cl_div_comment_container");
[22:45:10] <shoky_> (and btw stick with closest, better than parents usually)
[22:45:28] <shibly> It will be: var dv = $(frm).closest("div.cl_div_comment_container");
[22:45:53] <shoky_> yes. or:  var $frm = $(frm);  var $dv = $frm.closest(...);     then you also have $frm if you need it for other things too.
[22:46:33] <shibly> +Object[] , what does is mean by that?
[22:46:46] <shibly> shoky_: It returns +Object[]
[22:46:56] <shibly> Why?
[22:46:57] <shoky_> shibly: donno, where do you see that
[22:47:20] <shibly> var dv = $(frm).closest("div.cl_div_comment_container"); returns Object[] in console
[22:47:30] <shibly> var dv = $(frm).closest("div.cl_div_comment_container"); returns +Object[] in console
[22:47:33] <shoky_> what browser ?
[22:47:37] <shibly> firefox
[22:48:21] <shoky_> i donno, i use chrome mostly. that's how the console decided to show you this jquery object, i guess.. maybe you can click on the +?
[22:48:30] <shoky_> sec i'll check firefox
[22:50:03] <shoky_> shibly not sure why it shows you like that.  what is dv.length ?
[22:50:05] <shibly> Firefox is not a problem.
[22:50:18] <shoky_> it's firefox that's displaying stuff in your console
[22:50:43] <shibly> shoky_: dv.length = 0;
[22:50:44] <shoky_> and browser consoles try to do useful stuff, sometimes they turn out to be not so useful. donno if that's the case here though
[22:50:58] <shoky_> shibly:  then it didn't find anything
[22:51:09] <shibly> $(frm).closest("div.cl_div_comment_container"); why isn't it selecting/finding any div?
[22:51:13] <shoky_> what's  $(frm).length
[22:51:47] <shoky_> anyway  the "Object" part is because it's an object
[22:51:57] <shoky_> and the [] i guess is because it's an empty array-like object
[22:52:38] <shibly> shoky_: $(frm).length = 1
[22:53:16] <shoky_> shibly: well, it's not finding because i guess either your selector is wrong, or the element is not there at the time you're running that..
[22:53:17] <shibly> console.log(frm); = <form id="id_form_1" method="POST">
[22:54:30] <veek> why isn't this running - i have it inside a $(document).ready() - it works on the console $('section#contact form input').on('click', function(event){ $('input').attr('placeholder', ''); $('textarea').text(''); });
[22:54:57] <shibly> veek: Can you jsfiddle.net code?
[22:56:11] <veek> okay thanks
[22:56:53] <veek> shibly http://www.milleniumdentistry.in/
[22:58:06] <veek> ugh it's mnified
[22:58:10] <veek> hang on
[23:00:13] <veek> shibly, https://jsfiddle.net/6vw70kq2/
[23:00:42] <veek> jsfiddle should just except entire pastes :p and filter out stuff
[23:01:43] <shibly> shoky_: https://jsfiddle.net/f52eudbg/5/ , how can i select the top div? I have form or input submit button selected
[23:03:23] <veek> shibly, $('div')
[23:03:34] <veek> use the selector mechanism?
[23:04:57] <shibly> No, i have selected from tag, i have to find div from form tag
[23:06:44] <veek> shibly parent div ?
[23:06:49] <veek> ah hmm
[23:08:44] <veek> use :parent shibly
[23:08:51] <veek> filter
[23:09:01] <shoky_> shibly  you can do  var div = $(frm).prev();  with the way you have it now..
[23:09:16] <shoky_> because it's the previous sibling, not a parent
[23:09:33] <veek> oh yeah sry..
[23:10:07] <veek> can anyone take a look at my code.. why isn't it loading
[23:36:40] <shibly> https://jsfiddle.net/oq78qg9y/ , if i type something and click the button, it sends ajax request twice for the second time and thrice for the third time, and so on, Why is this?
[23:46:02] <veek> how do i do this: $('section#contact form input').on('blur', function(event){ $('input[name = "message"]).text().text('Default Text'); });
[23:46:23] <veek> if the text is '' then set to default text
