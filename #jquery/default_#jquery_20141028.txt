[00:00:34] <jphase> norc_: yes, you could use a .each to make that apply to all
[00:00:57] <norc_> jphase: Id rather want it to apply it only to the table where it matches the td :P
[00:01:26] <jphase> norc_: well it would, but only the first occurrence of the td.Foo column
[00:01:40] <jphase> if there was > 1 it wouldn't apply (I don't think)
[00:01:58] <jphase> well it would, but not on the header
[00:02:29] <ragas> interesting:  var x = $("#id"); x.attr("href"); // returns a link.  var xarray = $("a"); a[17]["href"]; requires non jQ object notation
[00:03:58] <jphase> norc_: this would be an example for all occurrences in the table:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pvvx0yot/1/
[00:05:49] <norc_> jphase: Oh yes. That looks elegant.
[00:09:20] <norc_> jphase: Alright I adapted it to fit my code. Thanks a lot, this is really sweet.
[00:09:33] <jphase> np
[00:49:58] <jumanji> is there a jquery library or widget for listing history of actions?
[00:50:38] <fat_> When I scroll, I want the list icons on the side to have the class active, everytime I pass an element. How can I achieve this? http://jsbin.com/gijenijuyo/1/edit
[00:57:58] <Cork> fat_: you would have to grab the position().top from the element and compare it to scrollTop
[01:01:30] <fat_> Cork: is it not possible to do it with elements, instead of fixed scrolling margins?
[01:01:49] <Cork> fat_: position().top is with elements
[01:01:55] <Cork> you grab the position of the element
[01:02:20] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[01:02:55] <fat_> Cork: but i'll need to add if statements for each of my elements right?
[01:03:12] <Cork> not really
[01:03:18] <Cork> you could use .filter for example
[01:04:18] <Cork> setOfElements.filter(function() { $(this).position().top < current + buffer && $(this).position().top > current - buffer; })
[01:04:24] <Cork> something like that
[01:05:09] <jumanji> hi guys how do i "shift" the entire document page so there's a space for me to insert a side menu?
[01:06:06] <Cork> jumanji: you either set a margin or insert the element so it pushes the content out of the way
[01:06:16] <Cork> jumanji: though you don't shift the entire document
[01:06:20] <Cork> as the menu needs to be in the document
[01:06:22] <jumanji> Cork: right that's what I Want to achieve
[01:06:28] <Cork> you need to shift a sub section of it
[01:06:43] <jumanji> Cork: basically im building a bookmarklet that when you run on any page, it will "shift" the page and insert a side menu
[01:10:23] <fat_> Cork: can you please put it in an example for just one of the links so I can learn to do it for others?
[01:10:58] <Cork> fat_: i gave you the basis of the code
[01:11:10] <fat_> ok
[01:11:15] <Cork> fat_: only thing missing is grabbing the scrollTop
[01:13:46] <fat_> setOfElements.filter(function() { $(this).position().top < current + buffer && $(this).position().top > current - buffer; })
[01:14:46] <fat_> so for each element, i have to copy and paste this code right cork?
[01:14:57] <Cork> fat_: no
[01:15:12] <fat_> i replace setofelements with my owne element
[01:15:14] <Cork> the filter will filter out the element matching the buffer range
[01:15:26] <Cork> so it is the element you should set "active" on
[01:15:36] <fat_> oh ok
[01:15:37] <Cork> just remove active for all the elements before you do the filter
[01:15:47] <Cork> fat_: note current - buffer is psudo code
[01:16:05] <fat_> oh right
[01:16:14] <fat_> current is the position of scroll now right?
[01:16:21] <Cork> yes
[01:16:26] <Cork> and buffer is deviation
[01:16:51] <Cork> you might want to base the bottom of $(this).position().top + $(this).height()
[01:18:08] <Erwat> i figured out the problem!
[01:19:59] <fat_> Cork: http://jsbin.com/laguviveqa/1/edit?html,js how does this look?
[01:20:36] <Cork> fat_: you need to create buffer in the filter function
[01:20:42] <Cork> as this is the current element in the filter loop
[01:20:49] <fat_> how do I do that?
[01:21:05] <Cork> uh, you put it inside the function instead of outside?
[01:21:38] <Cork> fat_: http://jsbin.com/laguviveqa/1/edit?html,js
[01:21:45] <Cork> i missed a return too :x
[01:22:09] <Cork> also buffer is wrong
[01:22:38] <fat_> ok
[01:22:45] <Cork> you have to change the formula as you use .height instead
[01:27:49] <john-dev> hey, i am reloading content via ajax (get) - i push this content with .html() into a div, the strange thing is, that the jquery bindings inside this ajax-content does not get removed when overwritten, it just stacks..
[01:28:21] <Cork> john-dev: you most likely delegate the event handlers
[01:28:50] <Cork> $(parent).on(event, target, fn) in modern jquery
[01:29:07] <Cork> $(target).live(event, fn) in really old jquery
[01:29:20] <Cork> .delegate an option in between :)
[01:29:25] <john-dev> $(document).on('change','.tags_changed_select',function(evt,params) {
[01:29:35] * Cork nods
[01:29:42] <Cork> those are expected to stick around
[01:29:56] <john-dev> thts the one which get’s triggered multiple times after overwriting it in a div with .html
[01:30:08] <Cork> john-dev: bind the event handler once
[01:30:14] <Cork> and just let it be for the other times
[01:30:19] <john-dev> okay, i will..
[01:30:36] <Cork> specifically, bind it on page load and not on ajax calls
[01:31:02] <Cork> that is specifically why delegated event handlers was created :)
[01:33:40] <john-dev> ok, works perfectly, thanks.. it’s strange anyway that this listener will not be removed when „overwritten"
[01:37:28] <jphase> it's an event "stack", you wouldn't be able to bind events to DOM elements if a plugin used the same event if it wasn't
[01:46:57] <Cork> john-dev: it isn't strange at all
[01:47:04] <Cork> john-dev: you bind the event on document
[01:47:23] <Cork> john-dev: so it won't be removed until document is removed from the dom (== never)
[01:48:10] <Cork> john-dev: that is the explicit point of delegated event handlers
[01:48:19] <Cork> john-dev: for the handler to not depend on the element existing
[01:48:24] <djam90> I have a jQuery created element like $('<button></button>') and have used .addClass() and .text() .attr('id','someID') and it works. However now I am trying to add a data attribute using .data(key,val) but it just doesn't work at all? No data attribute is added to the element? I have tried .data('id', index) and .data('index', index) and even .data('index',5)
[01:48:26] <Cork> *target element*
[01:48:55] <Cork> djam90: .data doesn't add attributes
[01:49:05] <Cork> it adds the data to an internal jquery cache
[01:49:14] <djam90> it adds a data-index doesn't it to the element?
[01:49:17] <Cork> djam90: this is to support any datatype
[01:49:25] <Cork> while attributes can only contain strings
[01:49:42] <djam90> so what if I want to add to the button element, the attribute, data-id ?
[01:49:49] <Cork> djam90: .attr('data-index', string); works
[01:49:52] <Cork> but only strings
[01:49:53] <djam90> oh :|
[01:49:57] <djam90> I never knew that
[01:50:01] <djam90> always thought you should use .data for those
[01:50:07] <Cork> you should
[01:50:15] <Cork> but you shouldn't expect it to become attributes
[01:50:21] <djam90> oh
[01:50:40] <djam90> so when creating an element in jQuery and appending it into the DOM, to add data-attributes, you should use .attr, not .data ?
[01:50:47] <Cork> $(this).data('index', 1) $(this).data('index') === 1
[01:51:05] <Cork> djam90: if it needs to be an attribute use .attr
[01:51:10] <djam90> awesome
[01:51:22] <Cork> if you just want to assosiate data use .data
[01:51:51] <djam90> I am adding the index of the element. It is basically an "undelete" button on an image, and the button needs the image's index to be able to un-delete it
[01:51:51] <Cork> to expand on the definition
[01:52:18] <Cork> $(this).find('.target').data('reference', this); $(this).find('.target').data('reference') === this
[01:52:34] <Cork> $(this).find('.target').attr('data-reference', this); /* exception */
[01:52:53] <Cork> (you can't convert a dom element to a string)
[01:53:21] <ussher_> Was using this $('.mce-tab').removeClass('mce-active') to remove all the active tab classes, but now only want to remove the active tab classes inside #main_tabs.  Tried a few variations that I thought should work,.... but the're not working.
[01:53:32] <Cork> hmm or it might ve something like '[Element #div]' or similar
[01:53:35] <Cork> anyway it wont'
[01:53:44] <Cork> *'t be the element
[01:54:14] <Cork> ussher_: $('#main_tabs .mce-tab').removeClass('mce-active')
[01:54:28] <john-dev> Cork: ok, i get it :)
[01:59:30] <ussher_> Cheers, Cork but thats not quite it either.  The #main_tabs is just the wrapper div.  the child divs either have or do not have the mce_active on them.  tried #main_tabs > .mce_ac........ trying again noticed the class is mce-active.  mmmmm.
[02:00:23] <Cork> ussher_: if the elements you want to target is inside the #main_tabs the id won't really help you
[02:00:26] <Cork> > can help
[02:00:34] <Cork> but only if they really are direct children
[02:00:52] <ussher_> cheers Cork.  yours works perfectly when i get the class names right.
[02:01:19] <ussher_> much appreciated.
[02:03:10] <dr0p0ut> hi guys, there's no one in the jQuery-dev channel so I'm asking here.. I was wondering about two methods which jQuery doesn't have by default and I use them quite regularly, so I thought about contributing and adding them.. I'd like to know your opinions on them (if they are useful and if it's generally a good idea to add them to jQuery).. the first one is a function which determines if an
[02:03:10] <dr0p0ut> element exists in the DOM before another element, so you could call $('#firstElement').isBefore($('#secondElement')); and it would return true/false.. the second one helps the user determine if an element is displayed in the viewport of the browser, in other words by using $('#someElement').isOnScreen(); you could also get true/false.. thanks for your opinions!
[02:03:36] <Cork> ugg
[02:04:01] <djam90> Is there like a "best practice" in marking an element as "selected", like, if you want to click an image to select it?
[02:04:24] <Cork> dr0p0ut: what's wrong with just doing $('#secondElement').prevAll('#firstElement').length > 0 ?
[02:04:52] <djam90> I am currently adding a class "img-selected" and then if I need to get the selected items, looking for this class
[02:04:57] <djam90> is that an okay way of doing this?
[02:05:15] <Cork> djam90: that is the normal way yes
[02:05:26] <Cork> there are other options, depending on what you need
[02:05:43] <Cork> (you could use label and <input type="checkbox"> for a none js dependnent solution
[02:05:44] <dr0p0ut> Cork: yeah it uses that, with a bit of fail-safe checks of input.. but it's basically that..
[02:05:45] <Cork> )
[02:06:18] <djam90> hmm. I thought about that. The images are all part of a sortable, and they can be "deleted" which moves them into a "deleted items" container, and also the same for "deactivated"
[02:06:50] <Cork> also there is the selectable extension for jquery-ui
[02:06:58] <djam90> yeah I saw that
[02:07:05] <Cork> depending on what you need :)
[02:07:05] <djam90> wasn't sure whether to try it
[02:07:08] <djam90> thanks!
[02:07:26] <Cork> i usually try to go the checkbox route
[02:07:29] <djam90> When there is a lot of stuff going on in jQuery the code gets quite messy
[02:07:39] <Cork> as i try to do without js as much as possible to normal interactions
[02:07:48] <Cork> s/to/for/
[02:08:01] <dr0p0ut> Cork: it's more of a shortcut-ish thingy.. dunno if stuff like that is welcome in the codebase, that's why I'm asking here
[02:08:23] <Cork> dr0p0ut: as core can do it in not much more code i would guess no
[02:08:37] <Cork> dr0p0ut: you're welcome to make a plugin though
[02:09:19] <dr0p0ut> Cork: what do you mean by making a plugin? just for this one feature? :)
[02:09:25] <Cork> though it wouldn't be much more then $.fn.isBefore = function(target) { return $(target).preAll(this).length > 0; }
[02:09:33] <Cork> dr0p0ut: yes
[02:09:55] <Cork> *prevAll
[02:11:28] <dr0p0ut> Cork yes with if (typeof(elem) == "string") elem = $(elem); so you can input both IDs and elements..
[02:11:38] <Cork> dr0p0ut: no need for the if
[02:11:43] <Cork> $() handles that by default
[02:11:51] <Cork> same with .prevAll
[02:12:07] <dr0p0ut> so wrap it always to make sure? just elem = $(elem)?
[02:12:16] <Cork> ya
[02:12:22] <dr0p0ut> that's nice
[02:12:29] <Cork> well the code i did only use each one once
[02:12:35] <Cork> so no need to create the extra variable
[02:13:05] <dr0p0ut> I was just thinking that .isBeforeElement() is easier to remember compared to the implementation, even though it's quite short
[02:13:24] <Cork> would break the name standard of jquery
[02:13:44] <Cork> no need to have a function that only works with elements
[02:14:10] <dr0p0ut> how about the second function? is there something that checks if the element is on screen?
[02:14:24] <Cork> on screen?
[02:14:29] <dr0p0ut> in the viewport
[02:14:31] <Cork> you mean as in "scrolled into view"?
[02:14:33] <dr0p0ut> of the browser
[02:14:51] <Cork> then no
[02:14:56] <Cork> checking that is expensive
[02:15:07] <Cork> you have to loop each element grab its top position
[02:15:10] <dr0p0ut> checks the position of an element with scrollTop() and offset()
[02:15:13] <Cork> and check it with the closest offset
[02:15:22] <dr0p0ut> yes..
[02:15:31] <djam90> Could anyone take a quick peek at the code I've written for my image management page? It is 150 lines, I don't want it to be completely read through, just see if it looks like I am coding in a proper way? I feel like it is all getting spaghetti code and not sure whether things are okay? http://jsbin.com/qeyuqaqafo/1/edit?js
[02:15:40] <dr0p0ut> is there a better way? or is it just a too resource expensive idea to add it?
[02:15:49] <djam90> For example things like DOM manipulation when moving images between multiple containers, not sure if I am doing this right, by cloning the items
[02:15:59] <Cork> dr0p0ut: i've helped several users here to do it
[02:16:00] <djam90> I would really appreciate ANY feedback
[02:16:14] <Cork> dr0p0ut: but there is already a commonly used extension for it
[02:16:26] <Cork> and again no i don't thing it needs to be bundled into core
[02:16:43] <Cork> dr0p0ut: remember every thing put into core becomes a cost everyone have to pay
[02:16:48] <Cork> even if they don't need the feature
[02:16:55] <dr0p0ut> ok, thanks :)
[02:17:26] <Cork> and jquery is already quite large :)
[02:17:54] <Cork> for comparison, it is larger then the complete turbo pascal ide :)
[02:18:09] <Cork> including editor, help documentation AND compiler XD
[02:18:38] <jphase> djam90: there's a few things that could shorten up like using .toggleClass instead of doing your own toggling, but it's well commented :)
[02:19:16] <djam90> jphase, awesome thanks. Do you think things are okay with respect to moving the images to/from the container and the deleted items container?
[02:20:25] <jphase> djam90: why clone and move when you could just move?
[02:20:49] <djam90> jphase, hm, I'm not sure actually! haha
[02:21:06] <djam90> will get rid of that
[02:21:16] <jphase> I used to do that too before I realized I could just move/append/whatever
[02:22:01] <djam90> ah that works! thanks
[02:22:30] <jphase> also, .removeClass() takes several classes, no need to call again
[02:22:39] <jphase> .removeClass('class1 class2')
[02:22:49] <djam90> ahh
[02:23:16] <djam90> fixed that!
[02:23:51] <jphase> and some don't like this, but when I do multiple css declarations, I use an object in .css()
[02:24:18] <djam90> hmm, makes sense. I will probably abstract that to a class. I was just testing
[02:24:21] <dr0p0ut> see ya guys, thanks for help
[02:24:41] <jphase> .css({ color: 'white', marginTop: '1px' });  <--- notice all - go away and the next character becomes camelCaseCapital for each -
[02:25:16] <djam90> ah yeah
[02:25:26] <djam90> same with attributes and stuff I've seen somewhere
[02:25:28] <jphase> I'm also a stickler for short stuff, so $('<div>') is just fine - it will close for u
[02:25:29] <Cork> you can do 'margin-top': '1px' too
[02:25:36] <Cork> i personally find that easier to read
[02:25:40] <jphase> ahh yeah
[02:25:42] <jphase> most do actually
[02:25:45] <jphase> I'm "weird"
[02:25:50] <djam90> ah didn't know $('<div>') closes it
[02:25:58] <Cork> djam90: it doesn't
[02:26:09] <Cork> its a short hand for document.createElement('div')
[02:26:14] <Cork> so it doesn't parse the string
[02:26:22] <djam90> I see
[02:26:34] <djam90> but in the HTML when I append it, it will be <div></div> ?
[02:26:44] <Cork> you don't append html :)
[02:26:49] <Cork> you append a dom element
[02:26:54] <jphase> oh didn't realize that Cork, hmm cool
[02:27:01] <djam90> yes lol
[02:27:03] <jphase> in terms of string parsing, that is
[02:27:04] <Cork> and dom elements doesn't have closing tags
[02:27:12] <djam90> got it
[02:27:17] <Cork> they are nodes with a parent and children
[02:28:04] <djam90> el.append(link);   $(item).append(el);    <<< can this be shortened?
[02:29:33] <jphase> $(item).append( el.append(link) )  or  el.append(link).appendTo( $(item) )  -  depends on what item is but there's a few ways
[02:31:16] <djam90> I have >> var imgs = deletedContainer.find('.used-van-image-div');  $(imgs).each(function(index, item){     but the item is not a jQuery object? so item.append() doesn't work there
[02:31:22] <djam90> I have to put $(item).append()
[02:31:29] <djam90> is this normal?
[02:32:27] <djam90> In the .each() loop, if I put item = $(item) then later on I can do item.append()
[02:33:00] <djam90> I thought because I doing a .each() loop on a jQuery object $(imgs) then surely each item in the loop is a jQuery object
[02:33:49] <jphase> you don't need the extra wrapper, no
[02:33:56] <jphase> already looping through dom objects
[02:34:12] <djam90> I get an error though call to undefined function on the item.append()
[02:34:13] <jphase> also, u can use $(this) instead
[02:34:20] <jphase> that's what I meant :x
[02:34:24] <jphase> muh bad
[02:35:22] <djam90> so when you have a jQuery collection of elements in $(imgs) and you do .each(function(index, item){} >> inside the .each, is "item" a jQuery item?
[02:35:28] <djam90> I am confused about this :/
[02:35:46] <jphase> it's not a dom object that you have jquery methods on, that'd be $(this)
[02:35:58] <Cork> jphase: ugg they have made the code much harder to read in later versions...
[02:36:01] <Cork> anyway var rsingleTag = (/^<(\w+)\s*\/?>(?:<\/\1>|)$/);
[02:36:13] <Cork> if that matches it uses document.createElement
[02:36:19] <jphase> oic
[02:36:21] <djam90> haha Cork !! thanks for that
[02:36:29] <djam90> that is some in depth help right there
[02:36:43] <Cork> djam90: i dig into the source quite often
[02:36:57] <djam90> So inside a .each() loop, $(this) refers to the current item wrapped in jQuery
[02:36:58] <Cork> but the current version is MUCH harder to read then older ones
[02:37:12] <jphase> djam90: yep
[02:37:27] <djam90> got it
[02:37:30] <jphase> well "wrapped" is subjective, but a dom object, yes
[02:37:31] <Cork> djam90: not really this refers to the current dom element
[02:37:42] <Cork> $() just wraps it in a new jquery object
[02:37:59] <Cork> meaning $('#target') !== $(this)
[02:38:32] <Cork> but $('#target')[0] === this
[02:39:39] <djam90> so if I looped through some elements using $(elements).each(function(index,item){} and I need to append current element somewhere else, I should use $(this).append(content) ?
[02:39:50] <jphase> yes
[02:40:17] <Cork> and you don't need to do it inside each if you want to move them all to the same *new* location
[02:40:33] <djam90> ok cool
[02:40:44] <Cork> $('#target').append($(elements))
[02:40:50] <Cork> or $('#target').append(elements) even
[02:41:00] <caraconan> Hi there. I would like to generate dynamically some code: http://paste.debian.net/129014/ I tried with 2 different approaches, but the CSS is broken. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks

[02:44:15] <doug64k> caraconan: put it in the html and .detach it out into something you use in code
[02:44:19] <djam90> jphase, also just realised that I was doing my sortable refresh wrong haha
[02:44:28] <djam90> I was calling .refresh() but its .sortable('refresh')
[02:44:46] <jphase> :x
[02:45:10] <shadej> here is my sortable div http://pastebin.com/USaZgCNf I am calling $('#example-1-1 .sortable-list').sortable(); from the console and it does not show me any error but when I try to drag an element an error is displayed on the console. help.
[02:45:46] <caraconan> doug64k: I know this is horrible, but I'm running out of time with this project, and its my first project with phonegap + JQM, and I don't want to add a templating system, I want to keep it as simple as I can, at the cost of breaking MVC paradigm
[02:45:52] <doug64k> caraconan: then .clone each thing to start from that state, modify it to specifics, and append
[02:46:16] <caraconan> doug64k: not sure to understand you, sorry
[02:47:39] <doug64k> caraconan: put the "template" in the html, perhaps using data-bind="something" to let you do lookups. in page init, var rowtemplate = $('#myrowtemplate').detach(); then in code, when I want to "make" a new row, I var newrow = rowTemplate.clone();
[02:48:10] <doug64k> then to fill in values, match those data attributes, $('[data-bind=name]', row).text(customername)
[02:48:24] <doug64k> then append row somewhere, done
[02:48:31] <doug64k> micro-template system using jquery selectors
[02:48:38] <caraconan> doug64k: I need to go step by step, my js skills are very basic
[02:49:21] <doug64k> caraconan: I'll show you an example
[02:49:30] <caraconan> doug64k: many thanks
[02:51:37] <mwargh> i set up several radiobuttons: http://pastie.org/9680366 how do i set which one is selected from javascript?
[02:51:59] <Cork> mwargh: .prop('selected', true)
[02:52:41] <mwargh> Cork: as i understand, they should have the same name= to behave as radiobuttons
[02:54:00] <mwargh> i'm trying $("#choose_option").val("yes"); but it doesn't work
[02:56:18] <MariusIT> hello
[02:56:56] <MariusIT> How can I load the following classes into a container that will ONLY initialize the class when i call for it. Like this http://pastebin.com/60JA8gTi
[02:57:02] <MariusIT> ?
[02:57:07] <doug64k> caraconan: http://www.jstraight.com/1127/1
[02:57:18] <caraconan> doug64k: many thanks, opening
[02:57:46] <MariusIT> damn it, not here
[02:57:48] <Cork> mwargh: yes
[02:57:59] <mwargh> Cork: ?
[02:58:03] <Cork> mwargh: val doesn't change what is selected
[02:58:13] <Cork> it changes what value the element has
[02:58:18] <caraconan> doug64k: many thanks, but I have another example here: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/examples/collapsibles/dynamic-collapsible.html#&ui-state=dialog But not able to adapt my code to it. Still creating the jfiddle
[02:58:38] <mwargh> Cork: thanks. but how to change what's selected?
[02:58:39] <Cork> mwargh: <input type="radio" name="a" value="0"><input type="radio" name="a" value="1" selected>
[02:58:46] <Cork> mwargh: i gave you that before
[02:58:52] <Cork> mwargh: .prop('selected', true) <--
[02:59:00] <shadej> anyone who tried sortable() function of jquery. here is my code. http://pastebin.com/dtL102AM. jquery dumps error when I try to drag a sortable item. help.
[02:59:03] <caraconan> doug64k: anyway I'll try to follow your approach, it's different. Many thanks
[02:59:14] <mwargh> Cork: but how to specify which of radiobuttons it will be?
[02:59:21] <mwargh> i guess it's based on value
[02:59:31] <Cork> mwargh: by selecting it with the selector?
[02:59:51] <mwargh> Cork: so they should have different id each?
[02:59:58] <Cork> $('#no').prop('selected', true)
[03:00:09] <Cork> mwargh: or you can select based on [value=""]
[03:00:20] <mwargh> Cork: yes, that's what i want
[03:00:36] <Cork> mwargh: but give the options a class
[03:00:52] <Cork> so you don't do something crazy like '*[value="yes"]'
[03:01:18] <Cork> so you don't do something crazy like $('.option[value="yes"]').prop()
[03:01:26] <caraconan> doug64k: definitively I will first try to reproduce the issue with jsfiddle. Many thanks for the example
[03:02:05] <doug64k> caraconan: do you follow my code though? It is a great way to keep a clean(er) separation of html and js
[03:02:29] <doug64k> you can often make major changes to the html and my js code won't need to be touched
[03:02:51] <caraconan> doug64k: I will do, but for 1.1 version, still learning how different frameworks fit together (cordova + JQM)
[03:02:57] <doug64k> you just put the appropriate magic attributes in the appropriate places, and make the magic happen in the js
[03:03:11] <mwargh> Cork: so i can't write just something like $('choose_option.option[value="yes"]').prop('selected', true) ?
[03:03:17] <caraconan> doug64k: very interesting, I will copy/paste the code
[03:03:21] <mwargh> i know i'm asking stupid things, sorry
[03:03:36] <Cork> mwargh: choose_option looks wrong
[03:03:41] <doug64k> caraconan: I'll look at your code too if you have it mostly ready to look at
[03:03:49] <Cork> not sure what that is meant to be
[03:04:36] <stephen> Would it be possible to bring only jQuery 2.1.1's ajax implementation into jquery 1.7.x?
[03:04:53] <Cork> stephen: why would you want that?
[03:04:58] <doug64k> stephen: you can load multiple copies of jquery and use them independently
[03:05:07] <mwargh> Cork: well, i have several <div class="radio"><label><input name="choose_option" type="radio" value="yes"/>Да</label></div> radiobuttons
[03:05:08] <Cork> stephen: just use the 1.x branch
[03:05:29] <Cork> mwargh: so give them the class and select on the value
[03:05:38] <stephen> Cork: specifically I need to get to the version which supports HTTP 500 errors in jsonp
[03:05:39] <Cork> mwargh: the name would be [name=""]
[03:05:44] <Cork> but attribute selectors is slow
[03:06:02] <Cork> stephen: 1.x is the same thing as 2.x
[03:06:06] <krastavac> is there some scrillable and active row plugin for tables?
[03:06:07] <Cork> except they support older ie
[03:06:18] <mwargh> Cork: name like this? <div class="radio"><label><input name="choose_option"  type="radio" value="yes"/>Да</label></div>
[03:06:18] <Cork> just grab the latest 1.x serie
[03:06:21] <mwargh> oh
[03:06:23] <stephen> doug64k, That's not an awful idea, i suppose I'd just namespace it out, eh?
[03:06:26] <Cork> mwargh: no
[03:06:33] <caraconan> doug64k: 5m and I'm done
[03:06:36] <mwargh> <div class="radio" name="whatever">
[03:06:39] <doug64k> stephen: .noConflict
[03:06:45] <Cork> and don't load multiple jquery libs
[03:06:50] <Cork> its a horrible idea
[03:06:59] <Cork> and creates a ton of problem with plugins if you ever need to use them
[03:07:09] <Cork> .noConflict is for other frameworks
[03:07:14] <doug64k> what problems
[03:07:16] <Cork> it doesn't fully work for two jquery versions
[03:07:26] <Cork> doug64k: like plugins sticking to the wrong version
[03:07:35] <stephen> Cork, specifically, I'm working on a legacy app on 1.7.2. It has a bugged jsonp implementation. However, Because of the testing footprint, I don't want to upgrade the entire library quite yet
[03:07:41] <doug64k> any loaded plugin will load into the last jquery that loaded
[03:08:03] <Cork> stephen: you could write a plugin to handle jsonp
[03:08:11] <Cork> it might be simpler then dual loading jquery
[03:08:14] <doug64k> I'm not advising it. the literal answer to the question he asked is yes
[03:08:17] <Cork> the concept is quite simple
[03:08:38] <stephen> Cork, I've already tried jquery-jsonp. It's really nice, but it has just enough differences to make it a pain
[03:08:57] <Cork> stephen: hmm well if you check the source on github
[03:08:59] <stephen> So I'm investigating this path too
[03:09:06] <Cork> the ajax code should be a separate file
[03:09:16] <Cork> you might have to tinker a bit to make it into a plugin
[03:09:19] <Cork> but it should be possible
[03:09:25] <vsgill> can someone tell me what is used to make these grid and the movement when selecting artists? http://www.harrisonparrott.com/artist
[03:09:25] <Cork> and then just have the plugin overwrite $.ajax
[03:09:59] <Cork> stephen: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src/ajax
[03:11:55] <doug64k> vsgill: FlexSlider
[03:12:04] <caraconan> doug64k: http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/1/
[03:12:19] <caraconan> doug64k: Now I need to add a "static" code to show how the CSS is different, 1 sec
[03:12:36] <vsgill> thanks doug64k
[03:13:10] <doug64k> vsgill: the code is fairly readable on his site, http://www.harrisonparrott.com/sites/default/files/js/js_1IwHzZDNvXaUOoIX5N4YOrFAYrq_74vydTh5KCiXeS0.js
[03:13:18] <caraconan> doug64k: Ok, done
[03:13:47] <fat_> Cork: I'm still working on it, can you please tell me what I'm doing wrong: http://jsbin.com/beyigoqame/1/edit?html,js
[03:14:13] <Cork> uh
[03:14:26] <vsgill> thanks doug64k ;)
[03:14:31] <doug64k> vsgill: scroll a bit - it's not all a wall of code :)
[03:14:43] <Cork> fat_: that is still the old code you used before i helped you last
[03:15:02] <Cork> (this is one of the reasons why i don't like jsbin)
[03:15:11] <fat_> i'll put it in js fiddle then
[03:15:13] <Cork> its "auto not save feature"
[03:15:40] <Cork> or rather "auto might save if i feel like it"
[03:16:56] <fat_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/ you have to make the html panel bigger or you won't see the navigation menu
[03:17:15] <Cork> uh
[03:17:23] <Cork> that really is still the old code O_o'
[03:17:31] <fat_> what's the new code?
[03:17:36] <Cork> ugg
[03:17:43] * Cork hate jsbin a bit more
[03:19:35] <Cork> fat_: http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/1/
[03:19:48] <Cork> that was the code i was meant to have given you before
[03:20:19] <fat_> ok
[03:20:25] <fat_> is there anything else that i need to add to get this to work?
[03:20:27] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/2/ a little more readable
[03:20:34] <Cork> jquery :)
[03:20:48] <Cork> and you need to run this in a scroll event
[03:20:54] <Cork> to get it to update as the page scrolls
[03:20:55] <fat_> ok
[03:21:13] <Cork> ugg
[03:21:14] <mwargh> Cork: i was able to do $('[name=some_option][value="yes"]').prop('checked',true); which works
[03:21:17] <mwargh> is this ok?
[03:21:35] <Cork> and you need to check that the bottom of the scroll view is below the element
[03:21:40] <Cork> totally forgot that -_-'
[03:22:01] <Cork> mwargh: that is exactly the solution i tried to tell you not to use
[03:22:13] <Cork> mwargh: that forces the browser to grab all elements in the page
[03:22:19] <Cork> then loop them looking for the name attribute
[03:22:26] <Cork> if that exist check its value
[03:22:37] <shebbi> http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/2/  <-- awesome! im stealing that!!!
[03:22:37] <Cork> then on the resulting list loop checking for the value attribute
[03:22:44] <Cork> and then filter on the value
[03:22:55] <fat_> Cork: it still doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/4/
[03:22:56] <Cork> it becomes a slow selector for no good reason
[03:23:03] <fat_> shebbi: mate
[03:23:12] <Cork> mwargh: set a class on the input elements and use that instead of the [name]
[03:23:24] <Cork> mwargh: or use an id, your choice
[03:24:04] <Cork> fat_: your not binding an event handler
[03:24:13] <Cork> oh sorry there it is
[03:24:21] <Cork> but i don't think .scroll is a shorthand
[03:24:25] <Cork> (might be wrong)
[03:24:41] <Cork> ah, it is
[03:24:57] <fat_> is that good?
[03:26:07] <shebbi> fat_: hi mate :)
[03:26:21] <Cork> fat_: http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/5/
[03:26:35] <Cork> fixed the error in the code and added the missing .removeClass
[03:27:31] <shebbi> when you click on the menu item it doesn't stay highlighted.
[03:27:37] <mwargh> Cork: so i should set different id for each of them?
[03:27:38] <shebbi> FYI
[03:27:53] <fat_> Cork: I have to change setofElements right?
[03:27:55] <Cork> mwargh: that's one option yes
[03:28:20] <Cork> fat_: you need to fill it with a list of elements
[03:28:32] <mwargh> Cork: or i can set the same class for all of them?
[03:28:53] <Cork> mwargh: yes, but then you need to filter on [value], list i've said before...
[03:29:09] <Cork> and filtering on attribute is fine
[03:29:16] <mwargh> Cork: ok, great thanks to you
[03:29:17] <Cork> as long as you reduce the number of elements before you do
[03:29:21] <Cork> with a fast selector
[03:30:44] <fat_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/6/ like this ?
[03:30:59] <fat_> I only added one in the array for testing
[03:31:02] <Cork> no
[03:31:10] <Cork> that isn't even a selector
[03:31:22] <Cork> $('')
[03:32:17] <fat_> where does the selector go?
[03:32:27] <fat_> var setOfElements = [ "shortcuts" ]; ?
[03:32:39] <Cork> that isn't a selector
[03:32:43] <Cork> its an array with a string
[03:33:03] <Cork> fat_: you know basic jquery right?
[03:33:08] <fat_> i do\
[03:33:12] <caraconan> doug64k: this is what I mean when I say "CSS is broken": http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/1/
[03:33:23] <Cork> them make a selector for the elements you want to include in the list
[03:35:24] <stephen> It seems I can get a custom build of jQuery 2.1.1, leaving only the ajax module, then noConflict() that as the last loaded version, and all globals /should/ be returned to 1.7.2
[03:35:58] <Cork> stephen: i would really recommend trying to rip out the core
[03:36:13] <stephen> Why's that?
[03:36:13] <Cork> cause plugins will make life a pain if you need to use noConflict() with two jquery versions
[03:36:27] <stephen> I see
[03:36:38] <Cork> you will basically have two different jQuery variabels in the page
[03:36:42] <Cork> depending on time
[03:36:57] <Cork> and plugins binding to one won't exist for the other and pain like that
[03:37:39] <mwargh> Cork: that's what i came up with: $("input[class='test1'][value='no']").prop('checked',true);
[03:37:41] <Cork> that is why i suggested going the slightly more complicated route of making it into a plugin without the rest of jquery
[03:37:54] <Cork> ...
[03:37:59] <Cork> mwargh: you
[03:38:06] <Cork> you're kidding right?
[03:38:48] <caraconan> Can somebody please help me with this issue? http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/1/ Thanks
[03:39:23] <Cork> mwargh: read up on selectors https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors#Class_selectors
[03:39:38] <mwargh> Cork: no, i guess i'm not very bright then it comes to coding
[03:39:43] <mwargh> Cork: ok
[03:39:51] <Cork> mwargh: this has little to do with coding
[03:40:04] <Cork> its about basic css knowledge
[03:40:17] <Cork> it is about learning the basics before jumping into the deep pool
[03:40:55] <mwargh> yes it's true, thing is i just need to fix this stuff for my friend and i'm not a coder at all
[03:42:20] <Cork> mwargh: there is a base level you need to know
[03:42:32] <Cork> css selectors and html two of them
[03:42:40] <mwargh> Cork: i agree, i'm reading link you provided
[03:42:44] <Cork> super basic js is the third
[03:42:53] <Cork> the rest we can help with
[03:43:42] <caraconan> Ups, right version: http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/3/
[04:08:50] <jigal> stephen tnx
[04:10:40] <fat_> Cork: I'm still confused about selector of elements
[04:11:15] <Cork> fat_: what is confusing you then?
[04:11:16] <codecutter> Trying to get the position of the vertical scroll bar.
[04:11:34] <Cork> codecutter: scrollLeft
[04:11:37] <fat_> Cork: var setOfElements = [ "shortcuts" ]; is this going anywhere?
[04:11:48] <Cork> or sorry vertical scrollTop
[04:11:53] <Cork> *oh
[04:12:06] <Cork> fat_: that creates an array with the string "shortcuts"
[04:12:13] <Cork> it isn't even a jquery call
[04:12:26] <Cork> fat_: sounds like you need to go through a jquery tutorial
[04:12:29] <codecutter> Cork: is that a $(windows) funtion? how do you call the function?
[04:13:04] <Cork> codecutter: http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/
[04:13:35] <fat_> Cork: $( "li" ).filter ?
[04:13:39] <Cork> fat_: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[04:14:40] <fat_> Cork:  $(".sidebar-nav").filter(function() {
[04:15:12] <Cork> you want to cache the list in a variable
[04:15:21] <Cork> so it doens't have to scan for the elements on every scroll event
[04:17:58] <caraconan> Why the class of the div ('aracoop-cat-2') is not applied? http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/8/ Thanks
[04:18:36] <fat_> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/f0v0fj4t/8/
[04:18:40] <fat_> how does that look?
[04:21:25] <fat_> even doing that, it still doesn't work
[04:28:42] <shadej> anyone who ever used sortable() ?
[04:29:26] <caraconan> Can somebody please help me with CSS applied to dynamic divs? http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/11/ Thanks
[04:32:29] <caraconan> The <div> contains the class, but inspecting through firebug the styles are not applied
[04:35:46] <Cork> caraconan: i don't know enough to help with jqm (i stay away from it)
[04:36:00] <Cork> caraconan: but i think you need to "refresh" jqm so it applies the missing classes and so on
[04:39:21] <dieguezz> hi, i got a grid of products. When clicking one, a full width div toggles below the clicked box. If you click on a box that its almost in the end of website, you dont see it because it toggles below, so you should manually scroll to it. How can i scroll to it automatically?
[04:40:11] <arschmitz> caraconan: Im happy to help what exactly is the problem that fiddle looks like its working to me.
[04:41:59] <caraconan> Cork: thanks
[04:42:15] <caraconan> arschmitz: the CSS is not being applied in the first element
[04:42:44] <caraconan> arschmitz: http://jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/12/ is much cleaner
[04:43:28] <caraconan> arschmitz: first <div> has "aracoop-cat-2" style, but is never applied to
[04:43:33] <HewloThere_> Hi there guys! I'm aware this isn't really on topic, however, I'm doing a survey of sorts (for personal interest) for what operating system people prefer to develop on, their development environment, etc. I was wondering if you could just take a minute or 2 of your time to fill this out? Most answers are either multiple choice or small text box. Thanks! http://goo.gl/forms/NkTjlZmF0O
[04:43:42] <caraconan> arschmitz: second <div> (the one static) is ok
[04:44:27] <caraconan> arschmitz: you can try both methods, dynamicContentA() and dynamicContentB(), but no dice
[04:50:27] <arschmitz> caraconan: what browers are you using this looks styled fine to me in chrome
[04:51:19] <caraconan> arschmitz: firefox. I think I also tried with chromium, one sec
[04:51:41] <caraconan> arschmitz: same error with Chromium
[04:51:55] <arschmitz> caraconan: both lists look exactly the same to me
[04:51:59] <caraconan> arschmitz: do you see that the <div> with the map is slightly unaligned?
[04:52:07] <arschmitz> yes
[04:52:08] <caraconan> arschmitz: pass me the url please
[04:52:33] <arschmitz> im just looking at your fiddle
[04:52:43] <caraconan> Which version? 8?
[04:52:49] <arschmitz> 12
[04:53:04] <badasafish> Hi all, I have a problem with jQuery conflicting with other stuff, can I elaborate to someone that understands this please?
[04:53:57] <caraconan> jsfiddle.net/caraconan/djt2gjqz/12 ?
[04:54:15] <arschmitz> yes
[04:54:27] <caraconan> arschmitz: the are 2 collapsible, 1 is wrong, 2nd is ok
[04:54:53] <arschmitz> ok so its just the alignment of the first view map button thats the issue?
[04:55:26] <caraconan> arschmitz: the reason is that the style "aracoop-cat-2" is NOT being applied to the 1st collapsible, the one generated dynamically
[04:56:14] <caraconan> arschmitz: I tried different methods: .trigger('create'); / .collapsibleset('refresh') / .enhanceWithin(); No luck
[04:56:42] <arschmitz> caraconan: give me a minute something is weird in that fiddle im just trying to figure out what
[04:56:56] <caraconan> arschmitz: the <div> contains the class="bla bla bla", but the styles are not being applied to
[04:57:05] <caraconan> arschmitz: many thanks
[04:59:35] <badasafish> anyone available to take a look at a jQuery conflict issue I have please?
[05:01:28] <caraconan> Apparently I'm running on this issue: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/faq/injected-content-is-not-enhanced.html
[05:04:03] <arschmitz> caraconan: yeah thats old and i wrote that page :-)
[05:04:56] <caraconan> arschmitz: lol, that frightens me....
[05:05:52] <arschmitz> caraconan: here you go
[05:06:01] <arschmitz> you were calling collapsible set on one and not the other
[05:06:05] <arschmitz> http://jsfiddle.net/djt2gjqz/16/
[05:06:08] <badasafish> any clever sods about that can help me out with a jQuery conflict issue please?
[05:06:28] <Cork> ?ask @ badasafish
[05:06:29] <b-ot> badasafish: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:06:29] <arschmitz> caraconan: on your static one it was a collapsible
[05:06:43] <arschmitz> caraconan: on your dynamic one your were putting it in a collapsibleset
[05:07:01] <arschmitz> so the allignment was different
[05:07:25] <caraconan> arschmitz: many thanks, I need to do a full review of your code. You saved me, many thanks
[05:07:54] <arschmitz> caraconan: all i did is delete all your calls to collapsible set
[05:07:55] <badasafish> I have a site that uses jQuery validation on a simple newsletter submit form, this works OK on some pages but not other: i.e. http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/ (OK)  http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/new-honda-motorcycles.php (BROKEN)
[05:08:24] <arschmitz> caraconan: and removed data-role='collapsibleset' in your markup
[05:08:38] <caraconan> arschmitz: yes, this is what I was seeing now. Many thanks
[05:08:45] <arschmitz> caraconan: no problem
[05:13:09] <stephen> Okay everyone
[05:13:11] <stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/festercluck/1r45xc27/
[05:13:35] <stephen> The plugin there will upgrade jQuery's ajax implementation to 2.1.1 in place.
[05:16:34] <Cork> badasafish: where do you have the code?
[05:17:14] <badasafish> cork: will viewsource allow you to see what you require?
[05:17:34] <Cork> badasafish: should i take that as meaning "inline"?
[05:18:31] <badasafish> cork: yes
[05:24:52] <Cork> ugg neither chromes or firefox, or firebug likes that page
[05:25:19] <Cork> badasafish: from the little debuggin i can manage on that page it looks like a race situation
[05:25:51] <Cork> bug hard to tell as debuggers break on that page for some reason
[05:28:18] <badasafish> cork: ok, im not familiar with that concept or how to resolve it
[05:28:54] <Cork> badasafish: it looks like you are sometimes trying to execute the script before the script is loaded
[05:29:07] <Cork> meaning trying to use the plugin before the script is loaded
[05:29:21] <Cork> putting a breakpoint at the .validate line
[05:29:32] <Cork> and hitting f8 when it gets there "solves" the problem
[05:29:46] <Cork> but source view and things like that becomes a mess so not completely sure
[05:33:43] <badasafish> cork: OK, any pointers about how to potentially resolve this?
[05:34:53] <Stephen> Cork, So I did it
[05:36:58] <bl4ckdu5t> At some poinnt I did $(element).html('some stuff here')
[05:37:12] <bl4ckdu5t> Cool as it took of the actual content of my element
[05:37:32] <bl4ckdu5t> but after a while I need the content back and the new stuff gone
[05:37:40] <bl4ckdu5t> Is there a way to return to the default
[05:38:11] <bl4ckdu5t> A way to tell jQuery that give me what came with this HTML not the DOM inclusions
[05:43:13] <fat_> Cork: Please help, im still stuck
[05:43:38] <Stephen> Cork, https://github.com/FesterCluck/jquery.ajaxOnly
[05:46:18] <Stephen> :-)
[05:47:08] <Stephen> bl4ckdu5t, You still looking for help?
[05:50:01] <Cork> Stephen: i would recommend looking at 1.x instead of 2.x
[05:50:11] <Cork> as 1.x is meant to be ie < 9 compatible
[05:50:30] <Cork> but they are identical in functionality
[05:51:16] <Cork> Stephen: meaning 1.11 == 2.1
[05:51:35] <Stephen> Cork: In testing I found that not to be trye
[05:51:38] <Stephen> true
[05:51:52] <Cork> Stephen: that would be a bug if that is the case
[05:52:04] <Cork> they are explicitly meant to be the same
[05:52:33] <Cork> http://jquery.com/download/
[05:52:35] <Cork> "jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8."
[05:52:56] <rpag> wow, 8 isn't even that old :)
[05:53:23] <Cork> rpag: but it isn't standard compliant
[05:54:25] <Cork> also note the "Since IE 8 is still relatively common, we recommend using the 1.x version"
[05:54:59] <rpag> yeah, IE was never one for standards but seems at long last that's changing for the better
[05:55:24] <Cork> rpag: they are working a lot with the standard bodies now days
[05:55:50] <Cork> and is actually pushing much of the interoperability work
[05:55:57] <rpag> yup, IE is getting better at least for developers
[05:56:08] <rpag> IE6 was a bloody nightmare :-)
[05:56:14] <Cork> ya
[05:56:19] <Stephen> Cork, https://github.com/FesterCluck/jquery.ajaxOnly/blob/master/old/jquery.ajaxOnly.1.11.1.js
[05:56:29] <Stephen> There's the same plugin written as 1.11.1
[05:56:30] <Cork> especially cause it was liveing long after its best before date
[05:56:44] <rpag> indeed
[05:56:45] <Stephen> Basically, 1.11.1 still doesn't handle 500 errors.
[05:57:02] <Uhkis> maybe that's because IE6 came out after the best before date
[05:57:04] <Cork> Stephen: then it means you can't support 500 errors cross browsers in ie pre 9
[05:57:25] <Cork> i have a vague memory that ie had some quirks with <script> error handling
[05:57:37] <Cork> like didn't fire then or something scary like that
[05:58:25] <Stephen> Yeah, I should note I'm speaking specifically to the JSONP implementation
[05:58:42] <Cork> Stephen: you did
[05:58:46] <Cork> :)
[05:58:46] <Stephen> ook
[05:59:32] <Stephen> So, anyway, in 1.11.1, if I cause a 500, the promise remains in pending state
[05:59:44] <Stephen> in 2.1.1, it is rejected
[06:01:34] <sacho> I'm not sure you could detect a 500 for jsonp
[06:01:45] <sacho> while maintaining ie old support
[06:01:49] <Cork> Stephen: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/error.html
[06:01:52] <Cork> yup
[06:02:00] <Cork> <script> errors works from ie9+
[06:02:29] <Cork> ie9... wow
[06:02:44] <Cork> sacho: nope
[06:19:45] <bl4ckdu5t> Stephen: yea. Am I above it?
[06:20:16] <bl4ckdu5t> I got off so quick for something
[06:20:37] <bl4ckdu5t> Stephen: ^
[06:21:12] <bl4ckdu5t> I have another way to do this but I thought an advise could help me do it in a better way
[06:25:17] <Stephen> bl4ckdu5t, That was forever ago, I forget the problem now
[06:26:14] <Stephen> bbiab
[06:26:41] <bl4ckdu5t> At some poinnt I did $(element).html('some stuff here')
[06:27:03] <bl4ckdu5t> and I needed to undo it
[06:27:24] <bl4ckdu5t> and return default content of $(element)
[06:27:43] <bl4ckdu5t> before DOM manipulation
[06:29:28] <dieguezz> hi, how can i center vertically an appended div when its appended?
[06:29:55] <sacho> bl4ckdu5t, there's no "default content" - you'd have to save the child nodes of this element before you replace them.
[06:31:19] <Cork> dieguezz: you would have to position absolute the element
[06:31:34] <Cork> have a fixed height and do margin-top -height / 2
[06:33:18] <dieguezz> cork
[06:33:30] <dieguezz> i want to scroll to it
[06:33:32] <dieguezz> so its centered
[06:33:35] <dieguezz> not move the div
[06:33:36] <Cork> ah
[06:33:50] <Cork> then grab position().top and height of the element
[06:34:03] <Cork> and calculate the size of the viewport
[06:34:19] <Cork> then change scrollTop so it is centered
[06:34:48] <bl4ckdu5t> ok thanks sacho
[06:35:51] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: a better option is often to insert a separate element
[06:35:53] <dieguezz> ty Cork
[06:35:54] <Cork> and just hide the old one
[06:38:17] <bl4ckdu5t> it's what I'd taught I'll have to fall back to
[06:41:00] <Yottabyte> Hey guys, how do I select say paragraphs that have no id or class selector in jquery?
[06:41:07] <Yottabyte> cause $('p') will grab all
[06:41:26] <Yottabyte> maybe use hasId or hasClass?
[06:41:53] <jnhghy> I have a jquery function that check a few fields and makes sure that they have only float numbers inside them (works great) but I then have some fields that are created on the fly by a javascript function ... how can I make my jquery function check them also? how can I make it recognise/be aware of them?
[06:41:54] <Cork> Yottabyte: css isn't good at selecting absence of something
[06:41:59] <Cork> you should avoid it if possible
[06:42:20] <Cork> Yottabyte: only option is to select all the element and then loop and remove the ones you don't want
[06:42:54] <Cork> something ugly like $('p').not('[id]').not('[class]')
[06:43:05] <Cork> but i SERIOUSLY suggest you don't do this
[06:43:13] <Cork> it is a terrible selector
[06:43:40] <bl4ckdu5t> Yottabyte, if you kw your dom structure yo can travrse to it
[06:43:55] <Cork> ya, that is a better option
[07:20:40] <Yottabyte> hi guys, how can I select a p tag that has no class or id selectors?
[07:22:39] <jnhghy> how can I re-trigger $(function() { ??? after I insert some dom elements throw javascript?
[07:23:19] <deadron> var a = function(){}; $(a); a();
[07:23:37] <jphase> Yottabyte: by its parent attributes or something that you can definitively identify
[07:24:06] <jphase> the short answer would be:  $('p')  :P
[07:24:58] <Yottabyte> jphase won't $('p') get ones that have a class selector even?
[07:25:11] <jphase> it was a smart ass literal response hehe
[07:25:17] <jphase> it will grab every <p> tag on the page
[07:25:39] <jphase> $('#some-parent-id p')  would be a more preferred approach
[07:25:45] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to submit file uploads with ajax - I have it working, but it is only sending the last file changed, not all files - http://pastebin.com/1WtRQtPX
[07:26:08] <Yottabyte> so I should design things in divs with certain ids?
[07:26:33] <jphase> Forbidd3n: your file input needs to be a multiple file input with an array name
[07:26:59] <Forbidd3n> jphase: the form field?
[07:27:10] <jphase> Forbidd3n: yes
[07:27:13] <Forbidd3n> name="rswcb_uploads[]"
[07:27:18] <jphase> yeah
[07:27:36] <Forbidd3n> thanks let me try that
[07:27:41] <jphase> and add multiple attribute
[07:28:16] <Forbidd3n> multiple to where the form tag?
[07:28:17] <jphase> Yottabyte: I really can't definitively say, I don't know what your markup looks like and what you're trying to do
[07:28:24] <jphase> Forbidd3n: the file input as well
[07:28:39] <Forbidd3n> weird, is this only for ajax uploads?
[07:28:45] <jphase> nope
[07:28:59] <jphase> any "use this one input to upload my entire desktop" type field ;)
[07:29:17] <Forbidd3n> so it should be <input type="file" name="rswcb_uploads[]" multiple> for all file input fields?
[07:29:33] <jphase> wait, are you using one file input or several?
[07:29:38] <Forbidd3n> several
[07:29:42] <Forbidd3n> 2 to be exact
[07:29:43] <jphase> remove multiple
[07:29:59] <jphase> actually, scratch what I said entirely
[07:30:04] <jphase> name them differently
[07:30:04] <Forbidd3n> ok
[07:30:07] <Forbidd3n> they are
[07:30:21] <jphase> hmm
[07:30:27] <Forbidd3n> rswcb_logo and rswcb_signature
[07:30:31] <jphase> and $_FILES has only one index in the array?
[07:30:35] <Forbidd3n> the file = is being overwritten
[07:30:40] <jphase> oic
[07:31:25] <Forbidd3n> at least it appears to be
[07:31:26] <jphase> you're overwriting the files var
[07:31:29] <Forbidd3n> not sure
[07:31:43] <Forbidd3n> right, but it should get them all
[07:31:52] <Forbidd3n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8775295/jquery-grab-a-file-uploaded-with-input-type-file
[07:32:13] <jphase> like... all that prepared stuff is bleh
[07:32:20] <jphase> $('input[type=file]').on('change', function() {  // do your post here });
[07:32:39] <Forbidd3n> so upload each file separately?
[07:32:39] <jphase> or maybe use the data.append
[07:33:15] <jphase> but that prepared function is just going to overwrite the files variable each time - turn that into an array if you really need to keep that
[07:33:41] <Forbidd3n> jphase: array doesn't work either tried that
[07:34:09] <jphase> well you're not pushing it onto the array though
[07:34:18] <Forbidd3n> I have tried that
[07:34:34] <Forbidd3n> can you give me an example with what I have to show me what you mean?
[07:34:35] <Forbidd3n> please
[07:34:42] <jphase> bah, one sec
[07:34:43] <Yottabyte> when we have an event like click and we want something to happen i,e, $('sommat').click(function(event) { //something }); why do we pass event?
[07:34:55] <Yottabyte> what is this argument event? I don't pass it a lot of the time and my things work
[07:35:17] <BillCriswell> Yottabyte: You only need to pass it if you need it.
[07:35:24] <Yottabyte> why would I need it?
[07:35:29] <Yottabyte> what it do?
[07:35:49] <BillCriswell> You may need it if you want to keep the event from bubbling up the DOM, stopping the browser from doing what it does by default, find out where the used clicked.
[07:36:09] <BillCriswell> In your click even do console.log(event) and poke around and you'll see a bunch of information.
[07:36:20] <Yottabyte> ok
[07:36:30] <BillCriswell> It's also useful if you wanted to get the element inside $('sommat') that was clicked.
[07:38:00] <Yottabyte> can you elaborate on that?
[07:38:12] <Yottabyte> because $('sommat') is a jquery collection?
[07:38:26] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: can you shed light on my question if you have time, please?
[07:38:26] <Yottabyte> and this event works on each individual dom element?
[07:38:31] <Yottabyte> (the one you click)
[07:38:41] <BillCriswell> Yottabyte: Yes.
[07:39:19] <Yottabyte> ah, ok, ty
[07:40:02] <BillCriswell> Yottabyte: No problem.
[07:40:43] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Looks like jphase is helping already and knows more about it.
[07:41:08] <Forbidd3n> He started to, but not sure if he stepped out.
[07:41:14] <Forbidd3n> Thanks though
[07:41:18] <jphase> Forbidd3n: http://paste.ofcode.org/387GtSYMBUCscYh7HaQVbCz
[07:41:22] <jphase> try something like that perhaps
[07:41:47] <jphase> I did that very fast and sloppy since I'm at work - forgive any syntax errors or anything
[07:41:51] <BillCriswell> He just takes more than 2 minutes to write up some code. Patience haha.
[07:41:55] * jphase slithers back into the shadows and waves at BillCriswell
[07:42:09] <Forbidd3n> jphase: I will give this a try now, thanks
[07:42:42] <BillCriswell> jphase: Howdy!
[07:43:12] <jphase> hmm... I can't remember... is $(this).val()  the same as grabbing .files  the js way in terms of file inputs?
[07:43:25] <jphase> if not then line 9 will have to be modified
[07:43:26] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: The $(this).index() here might collide since I think that number is determined by the parent element.
[07:43:53] <Cork> jphase: no .val doesn't check .files
[07:43:58] <jphase> oh, whoops all around
[07:44:00] <Cork> .val always returns a string
[07:44:03] <Cork> .files never does
[07:44:03] <Forbidd3n> Cork: what would?
[07:44:06] <jphase> that's what I get for being sloppy and at work lol
[07:44:15] <Cork> Forbidd3n: prop('.files')
[07:44:16] <Cork> opps
[07:44:18] <Cork> Forbidd3n: prop('files')
[07:44:22] <jphase> thx Cork
[07:44:35] <Forbidd3n> Cork: so $(this).prop('files');
[07:44:38] <Cork> yes
[07:44:43] <Cork> or just this.files :)
[07:45:04] <Forbidd3n> and BillCriswell what about the .index()
[07:45:19] <Forbidd3n> what should I use instead to keep from colliding?
[07:46:55] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Just a counter that adds one each time.
[07:47:17] <Forbidd3n> files.push(this.files);
[07:47:47] <BillCriswell> That can also work.
[07:47:55] <Cork> Forbidd3n: this.files is a list
[07:48:03] <Cork> you prob want to loop it and grab each file individually
[07:48:07] <BillCriswell> Why do you have the files arrry anyway? Why not put it right in the form data?
[07:49:06] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: like this - http://pastebin.com/xYVDshMw
[07:49:46] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Do they have values already?
[07:50:31] <Forbidd3n> so in the loop I need to check if value is if( ! jQuery.empty(value) ) ... correct?
[07:51:05] <BillCriswell> I thought you wanted to add them as they chance?
[07:51:07] <BillCriswell> change*
[07:51:27] <Forbidd3n> BillCriswell: you said to put it in the form data
[07:51:37] <Forbidd3n> this way works as well, no?
[07:51:57] <BillCriswell> but there was a change event there.
[07:52:24] <Forbidd3n> oh - I see what you mean add them to FormData() instead of an array, correct?
[07:53:01] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:53:25] <BillCriswell> http://pastie.org/pastes/9680918/text is what I was thinking.
[07:53:53] <BillCriswell> Not sure what .append() is but I followed your usage of it.
[07:54:04] <jphase> hehe, me neither
[07:54:10] <jphase> much cleaner than that silly array BillCriswell
[07:54:38] <Forbidd3n> this.files though not .value
[07:54:39] <Forbidd3n> correct
[07:54:55] <jphase> refer to Cork's comment above
[07:55:08] <jphase> and you can always console.log to test
[07:55:29] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Yeah, not familiar with that. I was more thinking baout the point of the files array.
[07:58:31] <P0rk> I have a fieldset that keeps track of it's "set" or "unset" stage by adding /removing a "set" class. How do I select the next "unset" fieldset?
[07:59:48] <P0rk> var nxt=fs.nextAll().not(".set")?
[08:00:25] <jnhghy> deadron: thanks for the suggestion, I ended up using DOMSubtreeModified :D but I appreciate your help ... it lead me to this solution :)
[08:00:33] <Cork> P0rk: i recommend toggling two classes
[08:00:53] <Cork> .toggleClass('set unset')
[08:00:59] <Cork> makes selecting cleaner
[08:01:05] <P0rk> isn't toggleClass a UI method?
[08:01:10] <Cork> no
[08:01:13] <Cork> ui extend it
[08:01:18] <Cork> (with animations)
[08:01:44] <P0rk> I have always avoided toggleClass much to my chagrin. I will try it, thanks.
[08:02:31] <Cork> i usually do something a bit paranoid like .toggleClass('set', state).toggleClass('unset', !state)
[08:02:38] <Cork> (where state is the new state of the toggle)
[08:02:46] <Cork> that way things can never get out of sync
[08:02:58] <P0rk> I know I am going about this all wrong, I'm making it way too complicated, but could anyone offer a better way?
[08:03:00] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/0yma5L6t/53/
[08:03:44] <P0rk> I commented out the first dozen attempts, but describe what I am trying to do about halfway down. There's got to be a better way.
[08:04:11] <Cork> P0rk: ya, set a class on the frameset and show the next frameset based on that class
[08:04:24] <Cork> that way you wouldn't have to have individual code for each section
[08:04:44] <krastavac> how to get all consecutive siblings with same attribute value in jquery
[08:04:46] <krastavac> ?
[08:04:55] <P0rk> I did that at first, but I couldn't figure out how to select a fieldset containing an "active" element in css
[08:05:09] <Cork> $('.exampleField').on('click', 'fieldset input', function() { $(this).closets('fieldset').addClass('answered'); })
[08:05:27] <Cork> P0rk: you don't
[08:05:30] <P0rk> but it's toggleable, and only one option in the group (like a radio button)
[08:05:35] <Cork> you set a class on the parent based on the action in the input
[08:06:01] <P0rk> but the second click makes it "unanswered" if the item is active
[08:06:20] <Cork> P0rk: so toggle the class :)
[08:07:01] <Cork> fieldset.answered input:checked { display: none; }
[08:07:12] <Cork> anyway i need to run
[08:07:14] <P0rk> I got that far, but it doesn't fix the hiding and showing of the .instr placeholder paragraph
[08:07:16] <P0rk> thanks
[08:07:27] <P0rk> I appreciate your help. I will look into it.
[08:07:40] <Cork> P0rk: what paragraph?
[08:07:56] <P0rk> each fieldset has the "select one" paragraph if none are selected
[08:08:17] <Cork> P0rk: so put it after all the checkboxes
[08:08:54] <Cork> and do fieldset > input:checked ~ p { display: none; }
[08:09:18] <fictive> Does anyone know of any autocomplete plugins that will work with adding both tags and regular text to a input/textarea? Something like this: http://daniel-zahariev.github.io/jquery-textntags/ But according to some of the issues on github it doesn't support mobile browsers, and hasn't seen an update in over a year
[08:09:20] <Cork> good luck
[08:09:24] <P0rk> ~ is what I couldn't remember. That checks all peers...thanks again...
[08:15:47] <reynierpm> hi everyone, I need some help in some codes Iḿ working on but Iḿ having issues
[08:16:05] <reynierpm> first, Iḿ getting this error ReferenceError: habilitarInput is not definedhabilitarInput("#btnBuscar"); all the time, why?
[08:16:57] <deadron> If I had to guess I would say hbailitarInput is not defined
[08:20:22] <reynierpm> deadron, could be but isn´t the case allow me to show you wait a minute while I upload some images
[08:21:18] <reynierpm> deadron, take a look to this image http://imgur.com/mbfcfmd,oWMlikZ youĺl see how habilitarInput is defined
[08:22:05] <reynierpm> deadron, now take a look to this second img http://imgur.com/mbfcfmd,oWMlikZ#1, there is where I´m invoke that function and as you can see the function is defined earlier in func.js file, so what is wrong there?
[08:26:20] <Yottabyte> does event bubbling always happen unless you stop propagation?
[08:26:35] <BillCriswell> Yottabyte: Yes.
[08:26:37] <reynierpm> So after get my first problem fixed I come with a second code related problem
[08:26:44] <reynierpm> see this code Iḿ working in http://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/3ygyvk0j/7/
[08:26:55] <BillCriswell> Yottabyte: Depends on the event though as well. Some events bubble, some don't.
[08:27:13] <robertmaxrees> Yottabyte not all native events, but jquery patches most of them so they do.
[08:27:24] <Yottabyte> ok
[08:27:54] <reynierpm> right now I´ve two issues, first one is when you add a pair by clicking on the create button the pair is added twice in ModelBranch div
[08:28:05] <reynierpm> why? what is wrong in my logic?
[08:29:25] <jhwhite> Is there an IRC channel for qunit or is this it?
[08:30:04] <Lazev> I have one simple issue and would like to know if there's a bug on new version of jQuery UI, can someone try this? http://labs.zipline.com.br/jqueryui.html
[08:30:24] <robertmaxrees> jhwhite there's no real dedicated qunit room.  you could try here, but you'll have mixed results probably.
[08:30:24] <KamalKaur> Here is my code: http://jsbin.com/nituhifece/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:30:37] <KamalKaur> On change of text field, the text color changes because a CSS is applied
[08:31:08] <KamalKaur> How can I apply a delay function such that the applied CSS gets removed after some seconds?
[08:32:35] <Lazev> I joined two simple jQuery UI Widgets and got a problem
[08:34:20] <robertmaxrees> Lazev not a jqui bug.  just need to modify some styles.
[08:34:25] <Yottabyte> so if I click on a p tag with a certain id, why would I ever want this to propagate?
[08:34:48] <robertmaxrees> Yottabyte it does by default, it's not something you turn on.
[08:35:04] <Yottabyte> yeah, why would I not event.stopPropagation();?
[08:35:07] <robertmaxrees> and it's nice becuase event delegation lets you bind one listener to listen for many events.
[08:35:33] <robertmaxrees> and on many elements.  it's also nice because it lets you bind a listener before something exists.
[08:36:31] <robertmaxrees> KamalKaur you want to use setTimeout
[08:37:30] <robertmaxrees> KamalKaur http://jsbin.com/xotewiluti/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:37:43] <Lazev> robertmaxrees: i'm trying...
[08:38:35] <KamalKaur> robertmaxrees: Yes, I tried the same.. what does 1000 mean here?
[08:38:51] <robertmaxrees> Lazev .ui-dialog { overflow: visible !important; } - something like that.
[08:38:55] <robertmaxrees> KamalKaur milliseconds iirc.
[08:39:17] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout yep - MS.
[08:39:34] <KamalKaur> But it remains green... o.O
[08:39:51] <robertmaxrees> KamalKaur right.  you set it green and then never do anything else.
[08:40:02] <Lazev> robertmaxrees: thanks, I'll see if this fixes my code
[08:40:38] <robertmaxrees> Lazev you might have to use a more specific selector, but that !important should do the trick.
[08:40:46] <BillCriswell> Yottabyte: IF you have #do-something-important and it has #so-something-else-important inside of it I'd expect the #do-something-important to happen as well.
[08:40:46] <KamalKaur> I'm talking about the setTimeout function, in he link you shared
[08:41:07] <robertmaxrees> KamalKaur the text turns green after one second.
[08:41:11] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're confused about.
[08:41:46] <KamalKaur> It should turn black after some time after... Means..  On change the CSS is applied and after some time it should turn black
[08:42:07] <robertmaxrees> KamalKaur so you want it to turn green immediately, and then turn black after x seconds?
[08:42:18] <KamalKaur> yes
[08:42:31] <robertmaxrees> should be easy to use what I gave you then.
[08:42:48] <robertmaxrees> put in the green color change before the timeout, then change the current timeout code to turn the text black instead of green.
[08:43:39] <KamalKaur> robbyoconnor: Oh thanks :)
[08:43:40] <KamalKaur> I'm done
[08:43:48] <BillCriswell> Sounds like css animations could work here as well... depending on the support you need.
[08:43:49] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete btw ;)
[08:44:20] <KamalKaur> robbyoconnor: autocomplete?
[08:44:28] <robertmaxrees> my screenname isn't what you keep pinging.
[08:45:00] <KamalKaur> robertmaxrees: Sorry!
[08:45:07] <BillCriswell> lol
[08:45:26] <BillCriswell> You figure it would grab the most spoken to person.
[08:45:43] <BillCriswell> Mine does that.
[08:46:22] <KamalKaur> BillCriswell: What do you mean by: "You figure it would grab the most spoken to person" ?
[08:46:55] <BillCriswell> The autocomplete would be smart enough to use robertmaxrees instead of the other handle it keeps completing.
[08:47:26] <reynierpm> Hi again guys, I moved my code from jsFiddle to JSBin here is it http://jsbin.com/quzice/1/
[08:47:31] <reynierpm> can I have some help here?
[08:47:53] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: What's the issue?
[08:47:55] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm i wasn't able to replicate your problem in your fiddle.
[08:47:59] <jquerywiiii> is there a call back for attr ?
[08:48:07] <robertmaxrees> jquerywiiii no need to have one.
[08:48:20] <jquerywiiii> i think i do
[08:48:30] <reynierpm> well if you run the code on the latest link I give you you will see what happen with results
[08:48:32] <robertmaxrees> it happens basically immediately - no need to have one.
[08:48:42] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm i clicked the create button and nothing happens.
[08:49:02] <reynierpm> hmm in the latest link?
[08:49:05] <jquerywiiii> robertmaxrees: ie does something weird though
[08:49:17] <robertmaxrees> jquerywiiii have a fiddle to demonstrate your issue?
[08:49:31] <jquerywiiii> i'm trying to fade out an image, change the src of it, and fade it back in
[08:49:44] <jquerywiiii> but on ie i clearly see the src being changed
[08:49:50] <jquerywiiii> i can make a fiddle in a sec
[08:49:54] <reynierpm> anyway the fiddle is working I´m newbie to this JSbin and need to get how it works first
[08:50:13] <reynierpm> BillCriswell robrtmaxress itś working now?
[08:50:29] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what working is.
[08:50:39] <verumequals> is there any jQuery plugin that does the slide left to right fadeIn transition? I found one but on my website it works just like a fadeIn and does not slide left to right.
[08:50:57] <reynierpm> BillCriswell by working I mean if something happen when you click create button
[08:51:07] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: In that case it works.
[08:52:30] <reynierpm> BillCriswell now, going to the issue try this, pick one Model and one Branch and click Create button and again change the Model to another one by keeping the same Branch and hit Create button once again then you will see how the first pair is added twice and that´s the first issue I´m having
[08:53:37] <Lazev> robertmaxrees: it's works! thanks
[08:55:01] <robertmaxrees> cool
[08:55:03] <jquerywiiii> run this on IE and you can see the problem I have: http://jsfiddle.net/s5djogr1/
[08:55:15] <jquerywiiii> it fades out, fades in swaps the image
[08:55:22] <jquerywiiii> instead of fade out, swap the image, and fade in
[08:55:34] <robertmaxrees> works fine for me in IE.
[08:55:47] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: I think you want .html() instead of .append()
[08:56:58] <BillCriswell> Also, console.table(array) is easier to read that stringifying it.
[08:57:19] <robertmaxrees> jquerywiiii 2 things come to mind, though: 1, you want .prop(), not .attr(), and 2, bind to the images load event - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s5djogr1/1/
[08:57:25] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: http://jsbin.com/niporo/1/edit?js,output is what I think you want.
[08:57:54] <BillCriswell> er, actually I think i confused something.
[08:58:20] <reynierpm> BillCriswell yes, that is what I want so simple :´( I was looking for a bigger issue at my code
[08:58:23] <reynierpm> thanks
[08:58:32] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: Welcome.
[08:58:43] <duvdevan> Hello from AndruIRC
[08:59:16] <jquerywiiii> thanks robertmaxrees
[08:59:16] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: I'm actually confused. not sure how this is working.
[08:59:24] <Forbidd3n> Is this correct? If the form doesn't have the class processing on it, then it won't run the uploadFiles function - jQuery('form[name="checkout"]').filter(function(){ return !jQuery(this).hasClass('processing'); }).on('submit', uploadFiles);
[08:59:49] <reynierpm> Now I have another problem and this is more related to code logic, I need to repeat the same behavior but this time using the results from previous code and the checkboxes under manufacturer and again pairs can not be repeated, how I can achieve this
[09:00:01] <Forbidd3n> or if it does have the class processing then it won't submit the form
[09:00:20] <reynierpm> BillCriswell why is that? I mean why you are not sure how it is working?
[09:00:31] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n that will return all forms that don't have that class and then add an event listener to them.
[09:00:37] <robertmaxrees> but that list won't magically update.
[09:00:57] <Forbidd3n> only form with checkout as the name
[09:01:00] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: NEvermind. Brain fart.
[09:01:15] <BillCriswell> Wait no.
[09:01:17] <BillCriswell> One second.
[09:01:41] <reynierpm> BillCriswell ok no problem let me know what you see wrong there
[09:01:55] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n you want something more like this: http://fixee.org/paste/4srkw6t/
[09:03:29] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: Yeah this was way off lol.
[09:08:13] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: http://jsbin.com/niporo/2/edit?js,output thre you go, actual good html in the output instead of the broken ass html I had it generate.
[09:09:25] <reynierpm> excellent BillCriswell, now can I have some extra help with the other code I can get it done?
[09:10:11] <reynierpm> BillCriswell this is what I said few minutes ago ¨now I have another problem and this is more related to code logic, I need to repeat the same behavior but this time using the results from previous code and the checkboxes under manufacturer and again pairs can not be repeated, how I can achieve this¨
[09:11:16] <BillCriswell> reynierpm: What you're doing should work find. join() all the values up and put it into an array, if the value doesn't exist in the array add it and do your thing.
[09:14:35] <BillCriswell> should work fine*
[09:15:11] <reynierpm> BillCriswell Iḿ working on top of your code to see if I get it so I´ll come back in a few minutes if I have any issue
[09:19:53] <reynierpm> BillCriswell is not working :-( can you take a look
[09:20:06] <reynierpm> BillCriswell http://jsbin.com/dunore/1/
[09:20:34] <reynierpm> BillCriswell http://jsbin.com/dunore/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[09:21:49] <BillCriswell> I can't right now.
[09:22:27] <reynierpm> oppps no problem any other can give me a push on the code that Bill was helping me?
[09:26:40] <dmsuperman> reynierpm: I can't but just so you know "not working" is a meaningless and useless statement
[09:26:55] <dmsuperman> if you want help with things, you need to explain what it's doing, what error messages you're getting, and what you expect it to do ;)
[09:30:55] <reynierpm> dmsuperman you´re right with ¨not working¨ I want to say that the results are not the expected I explain what I want to Bill but again let me show you what I´m looking for and copy again ¨now I have another problem and this is more related to code logic, I need to repeat the same behavior but this time using the results from previous code and the checkboxes under manufacturer and again pairs can not be repeated, how I can achieve this¨ Bill give
[09:31:23] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm have you tried anything on your own so far?
[09:32:39] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes, see the code that on $(¨createM¨) is what I´ve added but is not working
[09:32:52] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees as I said before
[09:32:58] <dmsuperman> there you go using that "not working" phrase again ;)
[09:33:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:33:14] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm I wasn't really paying attention, and your message got cut off btw.
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm what's with the two different arrays and the "map"?
[09:34:03] <robertmaxrees> those are really generic names.
[09:34:05] <reynierpm> dmsuperman hahaha don´t kill me is the only way I get to tell that my code my approach is not working as I want and sure is my code and I´m doing something wrong and for that I ask for help
[09:34:42] <dmsuperman> the point is we can't help you if we don't know how it is "not working". What are you expecting to happen? What is happening? are you getting error messages?
[09:35:13] <reynierpm> dmsuperman ok, lets remake the question again following your suggestion
[09:36:25] <reynierpm> dmsuperman it is not working because you won´t see any results when you click on the second button ¨Join ModelBranch with Manufacturer¨ since with this line $("#ModelBranchManufacturer").html($html); I think it will should write the expected results
[09:38:34] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm btw http://jsbin.com/heheturuqu/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:38:48] <robertmaxrees> you had a syntax error.
[09:39:09] <reynierpm> dmsuperman what I need and expect it to get the same results as the first code when I click on Create button, if you run this simple test pick one Model and pick one Branch and click on Create button the result will be output, right? Now leave the thing in the same way, meaning do not change your selection and again click the Create button nothing happen, right?
[09:39:13] <robertmaxrees> are you looking to add a new table every time somebody clicks that "join model-branchy with manufacturer" button?
[09:39:41] <reynierpm> dmsuperman That the right behavior since I do not want repeated results, now change any of the two lets said mantain Branch choice but pick another Model and again click Create button you will see how the new result is added to the table
[09:40:13] <reynierpm> dmsuperman and that is exactly what I am looking for but this time with manufacturers and the results from the previous code execution
[09:40:18] <reynierpm> dmsuperman more clear now?
[09:41:21] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes but if you are reading what I told to dmsuperman you will see the behavior and not a complete table but a tr instead
[09:42:05] <verumequals> would you guys consider this the best way to get the element that you'll append straight away?
[09:42:06] <verumequals> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16107267/getting-access-to-a-jquery-element-that-was-just-appended-to-the-dom
[09:42:06] <garethdaine> Has anyone here used TimeCircles?
[09:42:12] <garethdaine> http://git.wimbarelds.nl/TimeCircles/readme.php
[09:42:28] <robertmaxrees> verumequals to bind a listener?
[09:42:39] <verumequals> no just to select it
[09:42:49] <verumequals> or at least, have it jQuery usuable
[09:42:59] <robertmaxrees> verumequals which answer are ylou looking at?
[09:43:05] <verumequals> the accepted one
[09:43:16] <verumequals> but forget the binding part
[09:43:19] <robertmaxrees> verumequals you'd need to do $(el)
[09:43:30] <robertmaxrees> oh hah it's already a jquery object.
[09:43:32] <robertmaxrees> then it should workl.
[09:43:50] <verumequals> nice, thanks
[09:44:37] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine why do you ask?
[09:44:57] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: I haev a question on it
[09:45:00] <garethdaine> have
[09:45:03] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ garethdaine
[09:45:05] <b-ot> garethdaine: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:45:34] <garethdaine> OK, fair one, basically I want to submit a form when the timer ends but based on the limited documentation can’t work out how to do it
[09:46:04] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I can not find where the issue is
[09:49:23] <garethdaine> Any ideas robertmaxrees
[09:49:25] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: setTimeout to set the timer, and in the callback have it execute $(theFormNode).submit()
[09:49:52] <dmsuperman> or theFormNode.submit() if you have the non-jquery node
[09:50:18] <garethdaine> dmsuperman: I’m not using setTimeout I’m using TimeCircles plugin
[09:50:29] <garethdaine> In the docs it talks about adding event listeners
[09:50:37] <garethdaine> But not sure how to implement them
[09:50:49] <garethdaine> http://git.wimbarelds.nl/TimeCircles/readme.php
[09:52:30] <reynierpm> dmsuperman any ideas?
[09:52:43] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: here's an example that explains it: https://github.com/wimbarelds/TimeCircles/issues/3
[09:53:44] <dmsuperman> reynierpm: I get an error in the console when I click the second button
[09:53:57] <dmsuperman> or should it be the first button I'm testing
[09:54:34] <reynierpm> dmsuperman you should first go through the first button to create some pairs Model-Branch and after then go through the second button
[09:55:07] <reynierpm> dmsuperman the only error I got is a undefined when I try to add pairs using the second button but nothing on the console
[09:55:14] <dmsuperman> yeah
[09:55:38] <dmsuperman> well you should fix that as well ;)
[09:56:07] <reynierpm> dmsuperman this is what I can not I am trying to find where my error is but did not
[09:56:20] <reynierpm> dmsuperman so, help :-\
[09:56:43] <reynierpm> dmsuperman btw I am not a jQuery expert just a simple developer
[09:56:58] <dmsuperman> this is a simple error
[09:57:02] <dmsuperman> it tells you, key is undefined
[09:57:06] <dmsuperman> I believe it said line 54
[09:57:58] <reynierpm> dmsuperman how did you see line numbers on jsbin?
[09:58:26] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm this line: $html += '<tr><td><input type="checkbox" value="' + ney + '" /></td>';
[09:58:47] <dmsuperman> the error said something like filename:number:number , first number is line number, second number is character I suspect
[09:59:14] <robertmaxrees> rather, you have $html += '<tr><td><input type="checkbox" value="' + key + '" /></td>';, but that var doesn't exist.
[09:59:22] <dmsuperman> "ReferenceError: key is not defined at Object.<anonymous> (cefohemaqu.js:54:71)
[09:59:25] <dmsuperman> that was the error
[09:59:32] <dmsuperman> I just counted by hand to get to 54
[10:00:01] <garethdaine> cheers dmsuperman: I was close but thanks
[10:00:03] <reynierpm> dmsuperman robertmaxrees what code are you looking guys? this one http://jsbin.com/vapoxi/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:00:17] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm that doesn't have the error now.
[10:00:34] <reynierpm> dmsuperman robertmaxrees there the undefined error still and is what I am looking for how to fix it
[10:01:21] <dmsuperman> the undefined is in the string you have on line 55 or so
[10:01:28] <dmsuperman>                   $html += '<td>' + el.model + '-' + el.maca + '</td></tr>';
[10:01:28] <dmsuperman>                 });
[10:01:43] <dmsuperman> right, you put var-var and you get undefined-undefined, thus el.model and el.maca are undefined
[10:01:48] <dmsuperman> you are reading keys that don't exist
[10:03:02] <reynierpm> dmsuperman thanks I fixed that one now but if you take a look at the console on Firebug, why values are the same and I get now object? how do I get the values on the second code? I mean when I click the second button
[10:03:14] <robertmaxrees> also: var $allManufacturers = $("#branchModelManufacturer").find("input[type='checkbox']:checked"); what is this supposed to be getting?
[10:03:30] <hxm> hello guys, how to convert this format to timestamp? 30/07/2014 6:02 PM
[10:03:48] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees all the checked checkbox inside #branchModelManufacturer or do not?
[10:04:00] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm there is not #branchModelManufacturer
[10:04:21] <robertmaxrees> aaaah i see it now ignore more.
[10:05:18] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees wait a minute I´ve mixed some vars and maybe that is why code is not working
[10:05:38] <dmsuperman> hxm: You could use moment.js
[10:05:41] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm part of your problem is you're replicating a lot of logic here and tying your logic to your data too much.
[10:06:33] <robertmaxrees> also you're using really generic variable names, which makes things hard to read.
[10:07:16] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok you are right i am fixing code now
[10:22:37] <verumequals> starting to love jQuery really
[10:22:41] <verumequals> probably still doing basic stuff
[10:23:21] <robertmaxrees> it's a fantastic tool.
[10:23:24] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I am back take a look here http://jsbin.com/vapoxi/1/edit?js,output I try to do my best but now when you go through second test I got [Object] instead of old undefined, can I give some help now or still not clear to you
[10:23:25] <reynierpm> ?
[10:24:09] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm pretty obvious what the issue it.
[10:24:10] <robertmaxrees> *is
[10:24:24] <robertmaxrees> step backwards through the code.
[10:24:33] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees maybe for you but for me is not :-\
[10:24:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll see el.modelBranch is $checkedModelBranch
[10:24:42] <robertmaxrees> what is $checkedModelBranch set to?
[10:24:56] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes all the checked checkboxes
[10:25:00] <verumequals> if I have something like this: <div class="somelist"><h6>item1</h6><h6>item2</h6></div>, how can I ask jQuery to check whether or not that div has an h6 containg the text item2?
[10:25:20] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm right - that's an object, not a string.
[10:25:29] <robertmaxrees> you need to set $checkedModelBranch to a specific string instead.
[10:26:03] <robertmaxrees> verumequals $('.someList').find('h6:contains("item2")').length - something like this.
[10:26:23] <verumequals> thanks!
[10:26:29] <verumequals> if it does not, it will return 0 I guess?
[10:26:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:26:35] <verumequals> awesome
[10:28:21] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees hmm I get lost, what I need here at this point is to push foreach selected pair the key => value as you may notice but then how do I cycle for each? Can I give some example code from yours?
[10:28:29] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees you*
[10:28:54] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm i'm not modifying anything, i'm just telling you what i'm seeing.
[10:29:37] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees yes I know you are not modifyng anything but this is what I ask some code modify to learn and see how you will do it, can you?
[10:29:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't help that way ;)
[10:29:55] <robertmaxrees> i already told you what the issue is.
[10:30:09] <robertmaxrees> var $checkedModelBranch = $("#modelBranchPair").find("input[type='checkbox']:checked"); returns a jquery object, not a string.  you need a string instead.
[10:30:09] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees ok, thanks for your help
[10:30:39] <robertmaxrees> try to figure out how to get the text you want out of that object.
[10:34:10] <P0rk> if I want to insert a new  span as the first element inside a div, what's the best way to do that?
[10:34:45] <BillCriswell> P0rk: prepend
[10:34:47] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[10:35:02] <P0rk> hoorah. perfect...
[10:35:04] <P0rk> thanks
[10:35:10] <robertmaxrees> there's also a prependTo(), as well.
[10:35:15] <robertmaxrees> depending on the order you want to do stuff.
[10:35:37] <P0rk> I get so confused with all of that whether I am adding inside the element or outside...
[10:37:36] <BillCriswell> above element = before, inside start element = prepend, inside end element = append, below element = after
[10:38:08] <P0rk> I am going to make a chart of that. Thanks.
[10:39:38] <dronezero> Hello, I am trying to add a new row to a table when an input is clicked. It works great the 1st time, but after that it keeps using the same element instead of the last. http://jsfiddle.net/rsr62Ltt/
[10:40:56] <robertmaxrees> dronezero it runs $(".inputTable tr:last input") once and binds to whatever element was last when that ran.
[10:41:44] <robertmaxrees> event delegation to the rescue: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rsr62Ltt/1/
[10:42:18] <dronezero> robertmaxrees: Thanks!
[10:42:52] <robertmaxrees> do you see that that's doing?
[10:42:56] <robertmaxrees> *what that's doing
[10:43:43] <dronezero> yes sir it is direct vs. delegated
[10:43:59] <dronezero> reading the doc now :)
[10:44:51] <robertmaxrees> balllin'
[10:46:36] <BillCriswell> P0rk: http://jsbin.com/zekujo/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:48:13] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zekujo/2/edit little more sense.
[10:55:08] <verumequals> I am encountering something strange
[10:55:10] <verumequals> http://pastebin.com/E9TiKQVS
[10:55:31] <verumequals> at populateCurrentEvent(data[currentItem]);
[10:55:46] <verumequals> currentItem is always the last index
[10:56:25] <verumequals> hmm or maybe
[10:56:32] <verumequals> that somewhat makes sense
[10:56:48] <verumequals> but I want to use a specific element of data for the on click
[10:57:31] <BillCriswell> Wow, I am drawing a blank on the name of that issue.
[10:58:39] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Basically, use a forEach instead of a for to make your code work.
[10:59:05] <BillCriswell> verumequals: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example read this
[10:59:12] <verumequals> thanks
[10:59:16] <verumequals> and why a blank haha
[11:00:09] <BillCriswell> There was a word for this issue (I think) but I can't think of it.
[11:00:19] <BillCriswell> I guess the issue would just be "closures"
[11:00:30] <robertmaxrees> scope and hoisting.
[11:00:45] <BillCriswell> This type of problem comes up frequently during interviews through verumequals, so best read up haha.
[11:01:07] <robertmaxrees> closures are just functions that close over other functions.
[11:01:13] <verumequals> I was thinking how to google this problem
[11:01:24] <verumequals> but I couldn't think of a query that would make sense in my own words haha
[11:02:51] <robertmaxrees> basically, var appendElement isn't unique to your if statement - ifs share the same scope as the parent function.  same with for loops.
[11:03:27] <robertmaxrees> so all of those vars get their declarations hoised to the top of whatever scope you're in.
[11:07:57] <verumequals> thanks, I'm getting the idea
[11:08:02] <verumequals> it's working now :)
[11:11:53] <verumequals> love you guys <#
[11:11:53] <verumequals> <3
[11:12:05] <verumequals> it finally starts to come together
[11:12:16] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet
[11:13:55] <verumequals> are you guys actually advocates of the idea of letting the front-end do all the mark-up stuff instead of the server side?
[11:14:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[11:14:33] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I really follow.
[11:15:35] <verumequals> ehm, like all data is just passed on as json and the browser scripts are actually handling all the lay-out stuff
[11:15:50] <robertmaxrees> really depends, but not generally.
[11:16:45] <BillCriswell> If it's a one page web app I could understand that approach.
[11:20:10] <robertmaxrees> if it has a lot of dynamic stuff going on maybe.  i tend to prefer letting the server handle static things like the header and footer, then doing dynamic stuff with content areas as appropriate.
[11:21:57] <kingfisher64> can someone tell me the best way to add a class to a parent menu link? It's to change the functionality to collapsable rather than follow through.
[11:22:15] <robertmaxrees> .parent().addClass('yourClassHere');
[11:22:22] <pushpa> Hi, Im trying to get a quite simple Javascript to work correctly. My problem is that when you move the mouse over on any of the .item-img all of them slide down, .item-slider should only slide down on the unique item-img which one is hovering   ....  http://dpaste.com/34ZTZ2W
[11:22:30] <robertmaxrees> or .closest('.yourParent').addClass('yourChassHere')
[11:22:53] <BillCriswell> http://www.tacobell.com/ OH NO THEY DIDN'T
[11:23:13] <robertmaxrees> pushpa could you setup a jsfiddle with your html and this js?
[11:23:16] <verumequals> I see, well the footer, header and other stuff is still done by the PHP framework
[11:23:19] <verumequals> just wondering :)
[11:23:21] <kingfisher64> http://dogsnaturally.creatifpresence.net/product-category/dog-food-treats/ is the domain with the menu on.
[11:23:43] <robertmaxrees> pushpa i gave you two examples
[11:23:50] <kingfisher64> i need to add the class to some of the parent's not all
[11:24:29] <pushpa> robertmaxrees: where are they? :)
[11:24:44] <robertmaxrees> woops i meant that for kingfisher64
[11:24:48] <robertmaxrees> my bad haha
[11:24:51] <pushpa> hehe
[11:25:21] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, a fiddle would be nice.
[11:30:36] <scyclops> re: jquery mobile, does anyone know if it's okay to call $.mobile.changePage at any time during the page loading process (eg. pageinit, pagebeforeshow, ..) or should it only be called when no page loading is taking place?
[11:32:30] <P0rk> BillCriswell, https://app.box.com/insertmethods
[11:35:08] <pushpa> robertmaxrees: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/fja5uf06/2/
[11:36:05] <jokoon> hello
[11:36:37] <jokoon> can I call a function each time I type something in any text input ?
[11:36:49] <jokoon> just one same function for all inputs
[11:37:07] <robertmaxrees> jokke sure - it's called an event binding.
[11:37:28] <jokoon> would $(‘input’).click()
[11:37:31] <jokoon> work ?
[11:37:31] <robertmaxrees> woops, i mean jokoon
[11:37:42] <robertmaxrees> .click() is for clicking.
[11:37:56] <jokoon> keypress() ?
[11:38:02] <robertmaxrees> you probably want .on('keydown') or 'keyup', or 'change'
[11:38:04] <robertmaxrees> or 'input'
[11:39:53] <robertmaxrees> pushpa http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fja5uf06/3/
[11:40:12] <BillCriswell> P0rk: Nice and nerdy.
[11:40:37] <robertmaxrees> pushpa http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fja5uf06/4/ - this one has some cleaned up formatting.
[11:41:35] <robertmaxrees> also i moved your hide stuff into your css because it doesn't make any sense to do .hide() by default on stuff - just set display: none; using your css instead.
[11:41:45] <jokoon> robertmaxrees: so it’s not a jquery feature, only a js feature, you mean onkeydown=“code()”
[11:41:58] <robertmaxrees> johnkpaul i mean .on('keydown', function() {});
[11:42:18] <jokoon> mh
[11:42:23] <robertmaxrees> err, jokoon - never attach event bindings in your html.
[11:42:41] <tandroid> Hey guys, how would I bind a click event on resize only once?
[11:42:46] <jokoon> so I do $(‘input’).on(‘keydown’… ?
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> jokoon yep.
[11:43:02] <robertmaxrees> pushpa and lastly, that each for the initial hide was totally unnecessary anyway.  only needed $('.item-slider').hide();
[11:43:04] <tandroid> or if there is a way to just make it not clickable past a certain point that would probably be better.
[11:43:22] <robertmaxrees> tandroid don't bind listeners within other listeners.
[11:43:36] <tandroid> Makes sense
[11:44:04] <tandroid> Okay then the new question is how to make something not clickable at a certain "breakpoint"
[11:44:37] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on what you mean by "not clickable" - set a status bit somewhere and check that inside your click event handler imo.
[11:45:01] <tandroid> Oh perfect
[11:45:12] <tandroid> thanks robertmaxrees I don't know why I didn't think about that.
[11:45:26] <pushpa> thank you so much robertmaxrees!
[11:45:39] <robertmaxrees> i like to avoid adding/removing handlers as much as possible because it winds up being a gigantic PITA to troubleshoot and because you end up with cases like this where you're like "well how do I only attach it if I haven't" etc.
[11:46:03] <robertmaxrees> instead, leave the binding alone and let your handler take care of that logic for you.
[11:48:54] <tandroid> Yeah that's good advice. This is so much easier.
[11:49:03] <tandroid> And cleaner
[11:54:50] <Forbidd3n> If I set form to not submit on default $('#form').on('submit', function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault(); }); how would I be able to submit it after the successful ajax call
[11:54:51] <Forbidd3n> ?
[11:55:14] <robertmaxrees> use use e.preventDefault()
[11:55:23] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: ?
[11:55:31] <robertmaxrees> don't use both.
[11:55:47] <Forbidd3n> ok, will remove the prop, but back to my question
[11:55:52] <robertmaxrees> then just ship a boolean in your .trigger() that you later check for.
[11:56:12] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: example if you don't mind, pleasE
[11:56:16] <Forbidd3n> simple one
[11:56:18] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:56:21] <robertmaxrees> shows you.
[11:56:41] <Forbidd3n> so trigger submit?
[11:56:54] <Forbidd3n> or click on the button to resubmit
[11:56:55] <robertmaxrees> read the docs - they show you how to send extra parameters along with it.
[11:57:38] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to modify your event binding a bit, but it's fairly trivial.
[11:57:48] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: I know what trigger does. I stop the form on submit with e.prevent... but when I go to resubmit it with form.submit() in my ajax success it prevents default again
[11:57:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:58:03] <robertmaxrees> $( "#foo").trigger( "custom", [ "Custom", "Event" ] ); see this?
[11:58:21] <Forbidd3n> yeah
[11:58:36] <robertmaxrees> you could do $( "#foo").trigger( "submit", [true]);
[11:58:52] <Forbidd3n> so remove on and use trigger
[11:58:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:59:17] <Forbidd3n> use that in my ajax success
[11:59:37] <Forbidd3n> where does the true come into play?
[11:59:40] <robertmaxrees> then your event binding would be $('#foo').on('submit', function(event, resubmit) { if (!resubmit) { event.preventDefault(); } }):
[11:59:44] <robertmaxrees> read the docs, yo.
[12:00:33] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/y0r3kss/ with better formatting.
[12:01:46] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/y0r3kss/#url=zo2imwc
[12:13:02] <verumequals> hmm
[12:13:04] <verumequals> http://pastebin.com/trWw59GF
[12:13:12] <verumequals> the .done part
[12:13:22] <verumequals> after it is finished it should click on the first element of the list
[12:13:25] <verumequals> this however does not happen
[12:13:32] <verumequals> putting the click code in the browser works though
[12:13:37] <verumequals> has this got to do with timing?
[12:14:51] <robertmaxrees> you're using a done, so no.
[12:15:18] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:15:39] <robertmaxrees> ah wait, move all your stuff in that function into the done instead and use that.
[12:17:17] <robertmaxrees> verumequals ou wnat something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/j35c6rj/
[12:17:48] <robertmaxrees> also: $("h5#" + i).on("click", data, function() { - why are you doing this?
[12:26:27] <mattjs5> does anyone know a way to read a barcode (barcode scanner) from a web app?
[12:26:47] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:27:49] <mattjs5> how to make a web app that you can scan barcodes with
[12:27:59] <mattjs5> from a device with a camera
[12:28:13] <gurke_> is there an easy way to scroll bottom all time when scrollbar is already bottom?
[12:28:22] <gurke_> so when new content is incoming it says bottom
[12:28:25] <gurke_> like in a chat
[12:29:19] <mattjs5> set scrollTop to scrollTop.height when the textbox changes
[12:29:24] <robertmaxrees> mattjs5 a quick google search worked.
[12:29:46] <mattjs5> robertmaxrees: i also searched but don't know which route to go
[12:29:58] <mattjs5> looks like there might be a few options
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> mattjs5 you need to access the user's camera and then process that through some stuff.
[12:31:08] <mattjs5> access the camera like this tutorial describes?
[12:31:08] <mattjs5> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/
[12:31:23] <mattjs5> and what can i process it through
[12:32:04] <robertmaxrees> capture the image and find a barcode reader of some kind.
[12:32:46] <mattjs5> gurke_: im sorry i meant scrollTop to scrollHeight
[12:33:07] <gurke_> mattjs5 i tried $('main').scrollTop = $('main').scrollHeight;
[12:33:20] <mattjs5> what type of element is main?
[12:33:24] <robertmaxrees> gurke_ that's... now how you do that.
[12:33:27] <gurke_> its a html element
[12:33:37] <robertmaxrees> scrolltop is a method.
[12:33:51] <verumequals> robertmaxrees: because back then I didn't consider foreach
[12:33:57] <verumequals> which I'll change into a foreach now
[12:34:01] <gurke_> its not right?
[12:34:03] <robertmaxrees> verumequals that's not what i'm saying.
[12:34:06] <robertmaxrees> don't do either.
[12:34:14] <robertmaxrees> use a single delegated listener beforehand.
[12:34:28] <robertmaxrees> gurke_ $('main').scrollTop($('main').height()) or sometyhing like this./
[12:34:38] <gurke_> okay i try that
[12:34:47] <verumequals> I don't really follow, you mean I'll define a listener and attach it to the h5?
[12:35:19] <robertmaxrees> verumequals $(parent).on('click', 'h5', function() {}) - where "parent" is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> relies on this: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:36:45] <verumequals> robertmaxrees: your done example works, thanks.
[12:36:48] <verumequals> I'll read into it
[12:36:51] <verumequals> I'm really learning here
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about delegated listeners is you can attach them early on, instead of waiting for the elements to exist.
[12:38:05] <gurke_> thats working.. thank you robertmaxrees
[12:38:29] <verumequals> I'll try out :)
[12:38:36] <verumequals> about the .done part
[12:39:39] <verumequals> when would you prefer not using done but the normal (at least, which google tells you) way of $.getJSON("", function() { }); ?
[12:39:45] <verumequals> if there is a reason to ata ll
[12:39:53] <robertmaxrees> .done() is the standard actually.
[12:40:06] <robertmaxrees> the "normal" version calls success under the hood, iirc, which is deprecated.
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> but I could be wrong ther.e
[12:40:15] <robertmaxrees> it may be that they both call .done().
[12:40:28] <verumequals> hmm. Still yours works.
[12:40:30] <robertmaxrees> but $.getJSON() and its ilk are all actually just convenient shorthand for $.ajax()
[12:40:33] <verumequals> I tried it without the done part
[12:40:35] <verumequals> and it didn't catch on
[12:40:59] <robertmaxrees> verumequals if you did it the other way, you'd move all of your logic to that callback ,instead of using .done() at all.
[12:42:04] <verumequals> I see
[12:42:22] <robertmaxrees> probably was trying to execute both callbacks in parallel, actually.
[12:42:43] <robertmaxrees> which would mean the nodes didn't exist when the .done() stuff ran.
[12:45:00] <xtristan> i'm using prevUntil('element.class') to limit the scope of a backwards scope.  is it possible to chain something onto the end to get the "until" condition?  i tried using prevUintil('element.class').prev(), but that doesn't seem to be returning the element that i had used as a bound
[12:45:29] <kingfisher64> blimey, that was quick robertmaxrees. So taking your example i'm wanting to add the class .collapse to #widget-collapscat-2-top li.parent but only the outer parent as there are inner parents as well. (complicated category structure).
[12:45:40] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:46:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't recall what your questiuon was, sorry.
[12:46:34] <kingfisher64> no problems :) I see you've been busy answering everyone!
[12:46:57] <verumequals> amazing, thanks a lot robertmaxrees
[12:47:17] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 you can pass and selector to .closest(), including what you've got there.
[12:49:15] <kingfisher64> it's a nightmare as it's to apply it to parents with children only. the class .collapse makes that menu link well collapse since it's an accordion. In essence I'm wanting to replicate the dropdown arrow's funcationlity for parents with other parents inside them robertmaxreeson http://dogsnaturally.creatifpresence.net/product-category/
[12:49:43] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 we usually ask that you give us a small, self-contained example instead of an entire website.
[12:50:22] <robertmaxrees> .closest() will stop going up once it's hit the element that matches your selector btw.
[12:50:26] <kingfisher64> oh sorry, I thought the link would help explain better than I could robertmaxrees
[12:50:56] <robertmaxrees> so if you have multiple levels of li.parent, just do $(this).closest('li.parent') and it'll stop once it hits the first one.
[12:51:18] <kingfisher64> right, that sounds good
[12:53:22] <xtristan> does that search forward or backwards?
[12:53:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:53:33] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes "up"
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> .find() goes "down"
[12:53:50] <xtristan> ah, thanks.
[12:54:05] <xtristan> where i meant forward would mean down the dom tree
[12:54:53] <robertmaxrees> ah.  .find() gets ALL children that match a given selector, though. it doesn't stop.
[12:55:11] <varchar> why am i all of a sudden picturing Mr. Miyagi tell Danielson to go Up... Down... *shrugs*
[12:55:18] <xtristan> yeah, I just used prevUnitil() :)
[12:55:18] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:55:32] <xtristan> paint your house paint your fence retheme your wordpress
[12:55:42] <robertmaxrees> prevuntil is for siblings, not ancestors/children
[12:55:43] <varchar> lol yeah
[12:57:52] <xtristan> is there something i can use to get the item before prevUntil? i tried chaining .prev() on the end, but it seems to change the contents of the prevUntil variable that I was using as a cursor (e.g. var revealed_content = disregard_button.prevUntil('button.trigger-content'); var show_button = revealed_content.prev() //<- i want this to be my show content button)
[12:59:19] <gurke_> somehow my focus() does not work
[12:59:27] <xtristan> I want show_button to be button.trigger-content (i'm optionally hiding a serious of checkboxes)
[12:59:31] <gurke_> i have no idea why :P
[13:00:00] <gurke_> i think i throw a little delay in and it may work.. lemme see
[13:00:51] <robertmaxrees> xtristan http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tLetr4gz/
[13:00:54] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused.
[13:01:14] <gurke_> cool.. works with a little delay
[13:01:27] <xtristan> I know I'm confused, so good call robertmaxrees (and thanks for the help)
[13:02:24] <robertmaxrees> gurke_ that usually means you're doing something you shouldn't, but ok
[13:02:35] <gurke_> robertmaxrees :D
[13:03:15] <gurke_> i think its something wrong with angularjs there
[13:03:28] <gurke_> maybe it does not getting instantly shown
[13:03:40] <gurke_> when ng-show is not true
[13:03:55] <hellothere> hey there guys i need a little help\
[13:04:33] <hellothere> guys need some help, which JQ i should download from thist list http://jquery.com/download/ to work with this project https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js ?
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> hellothere depends.
[13:05:09] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[13:05:36] <hellothere> robertmaxrees sayy chrome for instance, but as of now im just concerned about having this just to work
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> 1.11 is what you want, then.
[13:06:17] <hellothere> so I should download it separete from this project right?
[13:06:28] <robertmaxrees> sure, or you can just use <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[13:07:44] <hellothere> robertmaxrees well, i just noticed i already have this line in my html, then now i wonder what else i need to do to get this project work ? :-/
[13:08:01] <robertmaxrees> that should be it.
[13:10:31] <BillCriswell> Geeze.
[13:10:44] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell hahaha yeah... i had to step out of that one.
[13:11:15] <hellothere> thennn for sure I'm doing something else wrong lol
[13:11:27] <robertmaxrees> open up your console and check for errors.
[13:12:14] <hellothere> let me go through that and a few other steps as well... i need to make this work for sake of doing it!
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> hellothere make sure you're including your code in the right spots, that you have no console errors, that you're in a document ready, and that your selector is good.

[13:50:07] <aphprentice> hey all, i'm trying to make a clickable div, inside the div theres a couple of spans that are left and right arrows to carousel through some items using jquery, however when i click on those arrows, they take me to the url for the clickable div, how do i prevent that?
[13:53:28] <verumequals> for a 100% width and height image slider, would you rather use an <img> or use it as a background-image?
[13:53:38] <verumequals> not completely jqeury relevant I guesss
[13:53:39] <verumequals> -s
[13:53:44] <verumequals> jQuery
[13:53:47] <verumequals> ok getting tired here
[13:57:43] <BillCriswell> verumequals: event.preventDefault()
[13:58:31] <verumequals> this is for me?

[14:00:40] <verumequals> BillCriswell: why did you highlight me with that?
[14:00:41] <BillCriswell> verumequals: I meant to say stopPropagation on the event.
[14:00:54] <BillCriswell> verumequals: http://jsbin.com/vujij/1/edit?html,js,output small demo.
[14:01:03] <xtristan> @hxm because the newlines are disregarded by the browser
[14:01:22] <BillCriswell> If you hold shift and click .child it won't bubble up to the parent because of the event.stopPropagation
[14:02:29] <verumequals> ehhh
[14:02:33] <verumequals> someone else asked that I think
[14:02:48] <hxm> and there is no way to avoid that?
[14:02:59] <xtristan> \r\n isn't html...
[14:03:06] <hxm> ah, using <pre>
[14:03:11] <xtristan> it's newlines and carriage returns that are specific to the os's prepresentation
[14:03:12] <hxm> yes, i got it
[14:04:07] <BillCriswell> verumequals: You're right lol
[14:04:40] <BillCriswell> aphprentice: You need to use event.stopPropagation(). Small demo: http://jsbin.com/vujij/1/edit?html,js,output
[14:04:54] <BillCriswell> If you hold shift the click on .child won't bubble to .parent.

[14:30:40] <definity1> Hey, Any good plugins i can use for horizontal sliding?
[14:31:41] <fredy_> Hi! I am using Jquery File Uploader from BlueImp. I was researching How to compress pictures on client side. According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21675593/cant-get-image-resizing-to-work-with-jquery-file-upload I had to call "Add function" again because of override -> I did it. My code uploads everything fine but without compress Could you please help me? my code is here -> http://pastebin.com/djSSBsZT
[14:33:11] <definity1> fredy_: Do you want to compress it or resize it?
[14:34:12] <fredy_> hi definity1, thank you for reply. I would like to resize it like the Demo at: https://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[14:36:32] <definity1> Okay well the demo is not working for me, and do you want to resize it client side or server side?
[14:39:08] <fredy_> client side
[14:39:29] <definity1> Im not sure hwo to do that. sorry
[14:39:36] <definity1> server side I would use PHP
[14:40:19] <fredy_> check this: www.backload.org
[14:56:49] <t0astt> Let's say I have a table, and each row in the table has some data as well as a button to remove that row from the table. What is the most efficient way to go about removing that row from the table when the remove button is clicked?
[14:59:54] <__joshua__> $('table').on('click', 'input.remove_row', function(){ $(this).parents('tr').first().remove(); });
[15:00:47] <t0astt> Can you walk me through the selector bit?
[15:04:02] <__joshua__> yes.  select a table, $('table').  add a event listener, 'on', click.  add the target 'input.remove_row' (input tagged element with class remove_row).  in the callback, use $(this) (the button), get the first parent of the button which matches 'tr', then remove it
[15:04:56] <t0astt> Got it. I'll try it out. Thanks __joshua__!
[15:05:52] <__joshua__> I should add that is delegation.... (delegating to the table).  this means 1 event handler attached, not x, where x is number of rows
[15:06:36] <t0astt> Ah....
[15:11:32] <v0lksman> I have a website served over ssl. I have a form that has action="". The form submit is bound to a function that uses $.post() to post to a relative url (ex: /contact/). For some reason Chrome is throwing an error claiming that while the page was loaded HTTPS some content was not.
[15:11:39] <v0lksman> it only throws this on submit
[15:12:09] <v0lksman> is there some attr I'm supposed to set on $.post to force https?
[15:12:43] <bowenac> anyone know how I can get each value from a serialized array response from php?
[15:13:09] <bowenac> well using ajax and php and I need to use each value of an array
[15:13:28] <bowenac> example result[i].photo;
[15:13:40] <v0lksman> bowenac: push it through a json lib and use json on the JS side
[15:13:52] <v0lksman> sorry...that came out all wrong
[15:14:02] <v0lksman> provide a json object response
[15:16:22] <robertmaxrees> or a javascript object response.  either/or.
[15:17:28] <v0lksman> ah crap...I'm hitting a redirect. grrr
[15:17:47] <bowenac> thats what the result[i].photo is which is the result in an array so not following
[15:18:03] <bowenac> which is the response in json
[15:18:15] <robertmaxrees> bowenac what's the issue?>
[15:19:23] <bowenac> im using php and ajax, and I am retrieing data from a db and I have a bunch of photo urls in an array. So my response for the photos is in one array. So trying to figure out how to access each url from result[i].photo
[15:19:33] <bowenac> this is being echoed back in a json array
[15:20:12] <robertmaxrees> can you share what the data looks like?
[15:21:22] <bowenac> a:3:{i:0;s:71:"http://example.com";i:1;s:73:"http://example.com";i:2;s:70:"http://example.com";
[15:21:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> that's what is looks like when it hits your JS?
[15:21:54] <bowenac> that is the ajax response
[15:22:03] <bowenac> well photo:
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> that's not parsable.
[15:22:10] <robertmaxrees> without some extra lifting.
[15:22:25] <robertmaxrees> get a json lib to spit it out for you.
[15:23:20] <bowenac> or would it be better to unserialize before the echo json encode
[15:23:31] <robertmaxrees> you need an actual object to parse.
[15:27:13] <bowenac> maybe I am going about it wrong
[15:27:45] <robertmaxrees> if photo is a:3:{i:0;s:71:"http://example.com";i:1;s:73:"http://example.com";i:2;s:70:"http://example.com";, then yeah.  the data isn't in a format that's easy to parse.
[15:53:39] <t0astt> Is attaching a value (like an id) for something to the id (like remove-app-##) of a button (or anything, really) and then substringing that id to retrieve the value bad practice? Is there a better way to store a value? I'm asking because I need to use AJAX to remove something from a database, based on an id
[15:53:51] <robertmaxrees> .data()
[15:54:06] <robertmaxrees> use .data() to attach data to nodes.
[15:55:31] <t0astt> But what if I am preparing the elements before jQuery/Javascript comes into play? Ie. with PHP?
[15:55:40] <robertmaxrees> data attributes.
[15:55:45] <robertmaxrees> that you read/set with .data() ;)
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> <p data-id="10"></p>
[15:56:14] <t0astt> Ah
[15:56:18] <t0astt> You know what
[15:56:26] <t0astt> Thank you. I never even knew the data attribute was a thing!
[15:56:32] <t0astt> Apparently new to HTML5?
[15:57:27] <robertmaxrees> yep, which you should take some time to familiarize yourself with since it was promoted to recommendation status today
[15:57:35] <robertmaxrees> ie the w3c spec is "official"
[15:57:37] <t0astt> Yep, just saw that as well.
[15:58:59] <jeffmjack> is there a best practice for intercepting data from form submissions with jquery?
[15:59:45] <jeffmjack> like, should I not define an action attribute for the <form> ? and then just do the $('form').on("submit", handler) thing?
[16:00:54] <jeffmjack> my plan is then to use show()/hide() to make the next <form> show up
[16:01:02] <jeffmjack> (it's a quiz app)
[16:02:37] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack write the form as per usual and then bind to its submit event like you had
[16:03:00] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault() });
[16:03:06] <jeffmjack> so since there is no url to submit for the form, just don't include an action/method?
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[16:05:17] <jeffmjack> i that' 'e' in e.event.preventDefault a typo?
[16:05:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:05:29] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault()
[16:05:34] <robertmaxrees> you can name that object whatever you want.
[16:05:38] <robertmaxrees> it'll always be the event object.
[16:05:47] <jeffmjack> e.event?
[16:05:50] <robertmaxrees> e
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(bigButt) { bigButt.preventDefault() }); does the same thing as  $('form').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault() });
[16:06:17] <robertmaxrees> you can name that whatever you want.
[16:06:26] <jeffmjack> oh i see
[16:06:55] <jeffmjack> yikes didn't realize I had to pass the event to the handler like that
[16:07:14] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah.
[16:07:20] <robertmaxrees> you have to define the arguments your function accepts.
[16:17:27] <doug64k> s/arguments/parameters/
[16:18:10] <doug64k> where arguments are passed to a function and are referenced by parameter names
[16:19:04] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue you're technically doing both with an inline anonymous function, but if you want to be overly pedantic, sure.
[16:19:05] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:19:44] <jeffmjack> thanks guys :) how would I assign a variable to the name attribute of an <input>?
[16:22:26] <Dylan_> Hey guys, I have three images in an <img> tag and I when I click on the image I want it loop through between these three images. http://jsfiddle.net/qjb3p42g/
[16:22:26] <jeffmjack> $('input').attr('name').val()?
[16:22:34] <robertmaxrees> .prop('name')
[16:22:35] <Dylan_> How can I go about doing this?
[16:22:40] <robertmaxrees> .val() is to get the value./
[16:23:14] <jeffmjack> so for <input name='halloo'>
[16:23:21] <jeffmjack> and I want myVar= 'halloo'
[16:23:27] <robertmaxrees> $('input').prop('name');
[16:23:33] <jeffmjack> cool ok
[16:23:45] <jeffmjack> thank you!
[16:23:58] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ define "loop"
[16:24:04] <robertmaxrees> you meen fade one out and fade in the next one?
[16:24:10] <robertmaxrees> or are you looking for a carousel?
[16:24:13] <Dylan_> Yes but I don't want it to stop.
[16:24:27] <Dylan_> but when I click the image. carousels havean arrow.
[16:24:33] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried so far?
[16:24:55] <Dylan_> I have tried this:  $(this).siblings('.slides').animate({opacity: 0}, 500);
[16:25:07] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle with what you've tried please :)
[16:25:25] <verumequals> robertmaxrees: so I think I reached the point where I really need delegated events
[16:25:37] <verumequals> but it doesn't work for me for now
[16:25:40] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: right now I'm struggling with hiding three images
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> you hit that point the moment you started working with them (bam)
[16:25:52] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ hide/show things with CSS.
[16:26:03] <verumequals> haha
[16:26:08] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: I only want first image to show.
[16:26:17] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: display: show and none; - I know that
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> display: show; isn't a real; thing iirc.
[16:26:30] <bongjovi> Can anyone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/pe6gsbjt/
[16:26:31] <bongjovi> Trying to console.log just the element I click on and not all of the divs.
[16:26:56] <verumequals> or nevermind
[16:26:58] <verumequals> it actually does...
[16:27:02] <verumequals> I just had an error somewhere else
[16:28:35] <verumequals> all right it works
[16:28:38] <verumequals> nvm me
[16:29:34] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/qjb3p42g/1/
[16:30:56] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ first off you don't have any .slides in there - you've got a #slides
[16:31:04] <jeffmjack> robertmaxrees: just to clarify... when you specify that val() is to get the value.... how are we not getting the value of the name attribute in this case?
[16:31:19] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for the value property.
[16:31:21] <verumequals> the carousel function is doing strange things
[16:31:36] <jeffmjack> oh I see :)
[16:31:39] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack .val() is for the value= in the html OR the current text if it's a text input.
[16:31:46] <jeffmjack> so same as prop('value')?
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> roughly.
[16:32:05] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qjb3p42g/2/ this is the first part.
[16:32:28] <jeffmjack> ok, right (** plus the text input thing).  Thanks again :)
[16:32:49] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: Hmm
[16:33:12] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: Why am I seeing three images all at once. I have the slides container as a wrapper.
[16:33:16] <verumequals> I am confused, does jQuery have a standard carousel plugin of some sort?
[16:33:23] <robertmaxrees> verumequals nope.
[16:33:48] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ you don't have anything that hides the images you don't wnat to see on load
[16:34:22] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: okay so now my step would be to hide the second and third image on load but not the first, right?
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:36:01] <bongjovi> Anyone have any idea? Or could point me to a resource?
[16:36:12] <verumequals> ah it's the twitter bootstrap js
[16:36:44] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi i'd point you to the learning center plugin authoring docs.
[16:37:30] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: lol. I'm a designer and I hate this. Haha. Is there a plugin that can help me do this?
[16:37:38] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ hundreds.
[16:37:45] <verumequals> all right, been working for 12 hours now, I'll call it a day
[16:37:47] <robertmaxrees> you want a carousel and then modify the styling.
[16:37:53] <verumequals> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot for your time
[16:37:59] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: I'm using Bootstrap and it has a slider in it.
[16:38:00] <verumequals> I'll remember delegated events, they're useful
[16:38:05] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ then use that.
[16:38:23] <Dylan_> robertmaxrees: but they all have those arrows to click but I want to change when I click on the image
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> Dylan_ then hide the images using css and add your own event binding.
[16:38:52] <robertmaxrees> this is all really simple stuff.
[16:39:01] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi you want something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pe6gsbjt/1/
[16:39:05] <t0astt> For some reason, when I click on a button that matches button.remove-period-button, the action "runs over"(?) and executes another ajax function, different from the one it should be executing (it does the addPeriod ajax function above it). Anyone know what could be up with this? Code for reference: http://pastebin.com/Lxb6UsJC
[16:49:16] <bongjovi> Thanks robertmaxrees

[17:06:31] <freudsfeud> How much is too much scripting at the bottom of a page? right now I am at 220 lines.
[17:07:09] <rpag> you have at least another 9k
[17:07:15] <ryanneufeld> freudsfeud: yjay
[17:07:34] <ryanneufeld> freudsfeud: fingers were off by one. What you're asking is rather subjective
[17:08:04] <freudsfeud> ok,
[17:08:29] <freudsfeud> bit of a noob still.
[17:09:00] <freudsfeud> just learned ajax and all the cool stuff the jquery can do and I just dont want to overdo it.
[17:09:17] <ryanneufeld> well, including your scripts at the bottom of the page isn't bad
[17:09:25] <ryanneufeld> and 220 lines isn't very much at all
[17:09:51] <ryanneufeld> but I would suggest putting it in it's own file, and then source that file in your markup
[17:11:30] <freudsfeud> ok, thanks
[17:11:35] <freudsfeud> I will do that.

[17:45:35] <shebbi> that's me smiling, not you.
[17:45:38] <shebbi> :)
[17:47:07] <verumequals> hahaha
[17:47:09] <verumequals> fy
[17:47:10] <verumequals> :(
[17:59:21] <fatmandown> can I add click methods to elements that have been loaded with .load?
[17:59:36] <systemfault> Yup
[17:59:59] <fatmandown> Is there a best practice to it? Can't seem to do anything to this div I loaded
[18:00:16] <wa5ted> systemfault: i know this i think
[18:00:20] <wa5ted> can i take a shot?
[18:00:26] <systemfault> Sure :)
[18:00:26] <jeffreylevesque> is there to execute ajax, only if a form field is filled?
[18:00:26] <wa5ted> fatmandown: do your click event like
[18:00:38] <jeffreylevesque> my current ajax, executes regardless if the field is filled
[18:01:09] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Could you show us a bit of code?
[18:01:16] <shebbi> jeffreylevesque: read about form validation using jQuery
[18:01:18] <jeffreylevesque> yes, sir
[18:01:28] <wa5ted> $("#static-parent").on("#dynamically-added-child", "click", function() {...});
[18:01:31] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/ajax_data.js
[18:01:35] <wa5ted> fatmandown: ^^
[18:01:41] <fatmandown> ooh, I like it
[18:01:56] <systemfault> wa5ted: Switch the order of the first 2 args
[18:02:08] <fatmandown> is there a reason why $("#dynamic-child").click(function() ... ); wouldn't work
[18:02:22] <wa5ted> systemfault: damn it so close
[18:02:26] <wa5ted> btw you taught me that
[18:02:29] <wa5ted> systemfault: ^
[18:02:30] <wa5ted> :)
[18:02:45] <systemfault> fatmandown: Because what's returned by $(selector) is only valid at one point in time... when it was called
[18:02:58] <jeffreylevesque> shebbi: I plan on using validation - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/243#issuecomment-59304090
[18:03:03] <systemfault> fatmandown: And #dynamic-child didn't exist at that point.
[18:03:03] <jeffreylevesque> just haven't gotten around to it yet
[18:03:30] <shebbi> jeffreylevesque: well now is the time.
[18:03:42] <fatmandown> high five for you guys
[18:03:56] <systemfault> fatmandown: Like wa5ted said, you can use "event delegation" by using the second syntax of .on, you'd do something like: $('body').on('click', '#dynamic-child', function() {})
[18:04:04] <systemfault> wa5ted: Hehe :)
[18:06:34] <wa5ted> systemfault: im stuck in the frontend and design channels that i dont spend as much time in jquery
[18:06:36] <wa5ted> :(
[18:06:56] <systemfault> Hehe :P
[18:09:30] <wa5ted> systemfault: they hate me over there any ways (good thing flame doesnt show in #frontend thank god)
[18:10:12] <systemfault> Come on :/ We like you everywhere

[19:07:00] <bkboggy> guys where can i find what properties are available for datepicker's onSelect?
[19:07:11] <bkboggy> particularly the object
[19:07:33] <bkboggy> i tried to look through the keys  var keys = Object.keys(i)... but it's odd...
[19:07:38] <bkboggy> inst.lastVal is missing
[19:08:03] <bkboggy> and I can't use it either, since it's undefined... however, some stack overflow posts refer to it
[19:08:06] <bkboggy> to get the last value
[19:08:10] <bkboggy> to compare to the newly selected one
[19:11:03] <gottagetgoin> i dont think there is anybody alive in this channel lol
[19:12:08] <bkboggy> there were yesterday... and you are
[19:12:24] <bkboggy> i just want to see if datepicker has changed dates...
[19:12:44] <bkboggy> not sure why they removed functionality if it was present before... this guy seemed to have it working on the earlier versions: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22454468/2006048
[19:47:26] <mchelen1> what's a good way to run one getjson, and then run another getjson using results from the first? should i nest the fuctions?
[19:50:05] <mchelen1> it looks like .done is the way to go since jq 1.8
[21:25:51] <amh345> i have some double-click code a client wants me to execute when a link on a page is clicked.  all the doubleclick close is wrapped in <script type="text/javascript">  and <noscript><iframe> etc etc.  how do i wrap this stuff on in an .click event handler?
[21:26:05] <amh345> close = code.
[22:42:16] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[22:44:09] <Stephen> hmm
[22:44:29] <Stephen> your use of my local colloquialism seems... odd, son.
[22:50:09] <phao> Hi. I don't mean to start a war or anything, but is JQuery 2 really needed? For the browsers it support, is there really issues with cross browsers incompatibilities?
[22:58:49] <soomro786> hey guys, if i have a var called list and im doing --> var $list = document.querySelectorAll('.messages > div'); how is it possible to have $list keep updating when new values are pushed to .messages > div?
[23:10:15] <kinesis> WHy doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/dsc0pyqf/
[23:17:02] <Uhkis> kinesis: you don't have jquery in it
[23:18:54] <Uhkis> kinesis: http://jsfiddle.net/dsc0pyqf/1/
[23:21:14] <kinesis> ok cool
