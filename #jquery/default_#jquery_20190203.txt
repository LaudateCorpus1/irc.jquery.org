[05:17:59] <devi8> does jquery have a way of listening for animation events in css animations?
[13:50:58] <ExoUNX> afternoon
[13:51:10] <ExoUNX> so I have a jquery counter going
[13:51:22] <ExoUNX> and I want to append to the element once the counter finishes, but I can't seem to figure out how
[13:51:47] <ExoUNX> it appends at the start of the counter then disappears because it updates
[14:09:47] <bestdesign> hi
[14:31:11] <ExoUNX> here's an example - https://jsfiddle.net/g8j1vyk9/
[14:31:12] <ExoUNX> and hi
[14:46:49] <Iarfen> hi!
[14:47:14] <Iarfen> how I can set the value of a hidden form field?
[14:55:10] <Cork> Iarfen: $('input[name="field-name"]').val('new-value');
[14:55:28] <Iarfen> Cork: ok, thanks
[14:56:59] <Cork> ExoUNX: you prob need to have a modification update callback from the counter lib your using
[14:57:15] <Cork> if there isn't one you prob can't do what you're trying to do and will have to put it beside and move it with css
[15:00:53] <bestdesign> how can make with .find if is not contain that id i search?
[15:00:58] <bestdesign> or class?
