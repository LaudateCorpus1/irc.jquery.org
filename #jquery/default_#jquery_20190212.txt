[03:44:10] <Cypris> jQuery's plugin examples show every plugin created as jQuery.fn.* (i.e. jQuery.fn.myPlugin). admittedly, i skimmed, but I did not see any mention of plugins for anything other than elements. Is making a plugin for objects and arrays, i.e jQuery.map (which would need to exist in jQuery.*) a thing?
[03:46:18] <Cork> Cypris: yup
[03:46:23] <Cork> just create them directly on jQuery
[03:46:34] <Cork> jQuery.myHelperPlugin = function() {};
[03:47:15] <Cypris> well yeah, I knew I could. nothing can really prevent you from doing it, I was just making sure that it wasn't frowned upon.
[03:47:28] <Cork> it isn't
[03:47:54] <Cork> one thing thoug, only add things that makes sense generically on the page (more of a sanity recommendation)
[03:51:27] <Cypris> though now that i think about it.. plugins created in $.fn get used via $("selector or <element>").myElementPlugin()... wouldn't be kinda cool if you were able to do $(obj).myObjectPlugin()?
[03:51:42] <Cypris> and i hear yuo, cork.
[03:51:46] <Cork> depends on what hte plugin is for
[03:56:00] <Cypris> ...holy shit. I did not realize that var arr = [0,1,2]; $(arr).map( function( n ) { return n + 4; }).get(); actually works like $.map( [0,1,2], function( n ) { return n + 4; })
[03:56:23] <Cork> ya, but with quite a bit of extra gc
[03:56:33] <Cork> hence why it isn't recommended
[03:57:12] <Cypris> I've been a hobbyist web coder for.. over half my life. I feel like I should know what "gc" means... but I don't.
[03:57:35] <Cork> Garbage Collection
[03:57:56] <Cork> it is the process that walk the javascript memory stack looking for memory not referenced by a variable
[03:57:56] <Cypris> I was gonna go wit good...code... or grandma's cookies..
[03:58:06] <Cypris> *with
[03:58:22] <Cork> the more memory you allocate the more work this process has to do
[03:58:36] <Cork> and while it walks the javascript stack the js has to be halted
[03:58:42] <Cork> resulting is gc hangs
[04:00:14] <Cypris> what exactly makes the $(arr).map have more gc? it seems like both should be doing the same thing...
[04:00:16] <Cork> (this isn't limited to javascript all languages where you don't have to keep track of dynamically allocated memory has it, so most scripting languages)
[04:00:25] <Cork> $() is a constructor
[04:00:31] <Cypris> right
[04:00:34] <Cypris> i get it
[04:00:38] <Cork> so it construct a jquery object around the array
[04:01:27] <Cypris> $.map is more or less direct access to the actual function where as $() has to do all of the things before it even tries to access the method.
[04:01:43] <Cork> $.map is basically just a for loop around the array
[04:02:12] <Cypris> but is "for loop around the array" nearly as catchy as "ring around the rosey"?
[04:02:17] <Cork> while $(arr).map().get() construct a jquery object, then calls .map it grabs the array from the object and loops it
[04:02:27] <Cork> and then constructs a new jquery object from the result
[04:02:35] <Cypris> I'm sorry for that last one. It's late. I'm weird when its late.
[04:02:37] <Cork> and then .get grabs the array from the second jquery object
[04:03:16] <Cypris> i understand.
[04:03:47] <Cork> it makes a bit of sense to do this for dom elements as jquery provides a lot of functions to work with them
[04:03:58] <Cork> but none for $(arr) as it provides none at all
[04:04:16] <Cork> (just a different way to do the same as $.map)
[04:07:44] <Cypris> I think out of the different help channels on freenode, this one nets me help (or at least a response) the most. I could count on one hand all of the times I've been to the vb.net channel and have gotten a response, let alone actual help.
[04:09:09] <Cypris> .....$(arr) provides map. isn't map strictly meant for arrays?
[04:09:45] <Cork> no $('').map lets you grab a child set of elements or something
[04:10:36] <Cypris> oh
[04:11:00] <Cork> like $('select').map(function() { if($(this).find('option[value="me"]').length) { return $(this).closest('td'); } else { return $(this).closet( } } })
[04:11:09] <Cypris> funny how it still works with the array.
[04:11:10] <Cork> like $('select').map(function() { if($(this).find('option[value="me"]').length) { return $(this).closest('td'); } else { return $(this).closet('section'); } } })
[04:11:16] <Cork> just an example
[04:11:28] <Cork> Cypris: it uses $.map internally if i remember correctly
[04:11:36] <Cypris> oh im sure.
[04:11:42] <Cork> and jquery is just an array like object
[04:12:00] <Cork> so in it's core it is quite the same
[07:38:42] <znf> So I have: test = $.ajax({ url:"/custom/translations.php", success: function(d) { return d; }}); -- which returns JSON (some translation strings); why can't I then access test['yes'], for example, where the object contains {yes: "translation"} ?
[07:41:35] <znf> but doing something like: $.ajax({ url:"/custom/translations.php", success: function(d) { console.log(d['yes']) }});
[07:41:40] <znf> returns the correct value
[07:50:45] <Cork> znf: ajax is async it doesn't return the content
[07:51:11] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function(data) { data.yes });
[07:53:08] <znf> uhm
[07:53:10] <Cork> the code continues to execute after you've called $.ajax() so you have to use a function to let it callback
[07:53:40] <Cork> .done(func) and success: func is the same thing btw (success is just an older format)
[07:53:52] <znf> I need all the translations accessible in a var :-/
[07:54:06] <Cork> then you have to call it before hand
[07:54:22] <Cork> or have everything execute from a callback from the ajax call
[07:54:45] <Cork> (you can still set it as a global or what ever, but the execution has to be triggered from there)
[07:55:00] <znf> *sigh*
[07:55:27] <Cork> really modern browsers has await to help with this, but you can most likely not use it yet
[07:56:31] <znf> I have the luxury of not needing to support IE11
[07:56:56] <znf> guessing there's no polyfill or something?
[07:57:05] <Cork> no
[07:57:20] <Cork> there are compilators that compile es7 to es5
[07:57:33] <Cork> but if the browser doesn't support await you can't use it natively
[09:31:30] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:32:00] <jomofcw> Using ajax(), is there a way to get the dataType resolution result in the success method, please ?
[09:32:34] <Cork> jomofcw: what do you mean?
[09:32:45] <jomofcw> Hello Cork ^^ !
[09:32:49] <Cork> get the servers content-type response?
[09:32:57] <jomofcw> Cork yes !
[09:33:38] <jomofcw> Or no... dunno... when I put settings in the ajax call, i let "dataType" on "intelligent guess". I would like to know what it "guess".
[09:34:00] <jomofcw> Dunno if it's clearer explaindes this way...
[09:34:29] <Cork> you can just skip the dataType property if you set it to that
[09:34:50] <Cork> and that means you want the content-type from the server
[09:35:03] <Cork> cause what the server sets as content-type is what jquery uses to parse the response
[09:37:09] <jomofcw> Cork OK ^^. I get it. Thanks :).
[09:42:05] <Cork> jomofcw: so if you haven't found it .done(function(data, status, jqxhr) { console.log(jqxhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type')) });
[09:46:07] <jomofcw> Cork thanks, I was looking for it xD.
[09:47:09] <Cork> had to dig around in memory, haven't had to use that in ages
[09:53:58] <jomofcw> Cork yea because it's probably not the right way to do if i have to use it :/.
[09:54:15] <Cork> jomofcw: what is it you're trying to do?
[10:22:48] <jomofcw> Cork I submit a form using AJAX, if this one contain error, I need to refresh its content (to display the error, but if there's no error, the server reply with a simple JSON that contains an address to which the browser have to redirect.
[13:25:31] <tokam> hello, can you please tell me why this ajax request fails?
[13:25:31] <tokam> https://jsfiddle.net/xjrhw69u/
[13:26:00] <tokam> I am wondering since several minutes why it fails.
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> well
[13:26:23] <robertmaxrees> dataType is what you expect to come back from the server.
[13:26:27] <robertmaxrees> but the response is empty
[13:27:24] <robertmaxrees> also: you contentType is incorrect.
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> you're not sending JSON in this case.
[13:28:10] <robertmaxrees> tokam https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7ez25tn3/4/
[13:29:33] <tokam> thx
[13:29:40] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[13:29:56] <tokam> response should not be empty
[13:30:24] <robertmaxrees> now it isn't.
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> what you had before was breaking it.
[13:30:41] <jrockjiggz> Hello. I'm trying to use  $('body').animate({ scrollTop: 100 }); but the window is not scrolling. any ideas how to troubleshoot?
[13:30:46] <robertmaxrees> server din't know how to handle the request.
[13:30:58] <taplar> jrockjiggz: got a fiddle?
[13:31:15] <jrockjiggz> taplar: no I havent
[13:31:31] <taplar> would help us to help you debug
[13:31:51] <tokam> I am using jQuery 1.12.1
[13:31:59] <tokam> my jsFiddle was on the wrong version
[13:32:00] <taplar> otherwise, check your console and make sure there are no errors, and make sure the body height is scrollable
[13:32:05] <tokam> I can not change the version
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> tokam ok?
[13:33:00] <jrockjiggz> hmm. $('body').height() is returning 0.  that must be why. :) thanks for the suggestion
[13:33:18] <taplar> if that's 0, something is really wrong
[13:33:20] <tokam> https://jsfiddle.net/xjrhw69u/1/
[13:33:22] <tokam> this works
[13:33:42] <robertmaxrees> tokam because now dataType matches what's coming back.
[13:33:51] <tokam> thx
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> earlier, you had an empty response, so it wasn't json.
[13:35:26] <taplar> tokam: your server is also not returning the correct Content-Type for that response
[13:35:32] <tokam> why?
[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:35:46] <taplar> your response is json, but it has the Content-Type as text/html
[13:36:01] <taplar> if it was set properly, you wouldn't need the dataType property
[13:36:07] <tokam> text/json is fine?
[13:36:11] <taplar> application/json
[13:36:14] <tokam> thx
[13:53:39] <denisbr> Hi People. Can I define a maxWidth dynamic value for use in the resizable interaction?
[13:54:00] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[13:56:45] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, sorry?
[13:57:00] <robertmaxrees> a test case on jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/
[13:57:22] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#method-option can be used to change the config options after the fact
[13:57:24] <robertmaxrees> helps us see what you're talking about and removes a lot of misunderstanding/miscommunication.
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> also: why would you redefine any maxwidth on the fly?  doesn't really seem like you want a max width at all at that point.
[14:14:48] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/a7ndktys/
[14:15:27] <robertmaxrees> why the multiple doc readies?
[14:15:37] <taplar> beat me to it
[14:15:39] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ready(function() { and $(function() { do the same thing
[14:16:00] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, Ok, it was my error
[14:16:10] <robertmaxrees> also, jquery latest and jqui don't play nicely together: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nqsdzp4g/1/
[14:16:15] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to do here?
[14:18:49] <robertmaxrees> denisbr ^
[14:19:00] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, I wanna to change the maxWidth value from resizable elements when I change the input value
[14:19:07] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[14:21:28] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, On my application, that user can create dynamics elements into a div, and to specific the width/height from this div... When the dimension div is changed, I need that next elements only is resizable on the max width from div
[14:21:40] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:21:53] <robertmaxrees> so yeah ^ check out the link taplar shot over.  should tell you how to do it :)
[14:25:05] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, Sorry, i can´t understand you
[14:25:22] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#method-option can be used to change the config options after the fact
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:29:54] <denisbr> Ah ok ... I will see these link... Thanks
[15:42:44] <znf> So I'm trying to: function async getTranslations() { const result = await $.ajax({url: "/custom/translations"}); }; var l = getTranslations();
[15:43:03] <znf> but when I call l['translation'] I get undefined
[15:43:04] <znf> what gives?
[15:44:12] <znf> erm, there's also a return result in there
[19:00:09] <Burnt> hi ... if I can get the closet div with div2select = $(this).parent().parent().parent().closest('div')... how can I get the data-extra property of that newly found div?
[19:00:14] <Burnt> thanks in advance
[19:02:57] <Burnt> $(this).parent().parent().parent().closest('div').data(extra).val() is undefined
[19:08:57] <shoky> Burnt: .data(‘extra’)   and no .val()
[19:09:54] <Burnt> dosent work
[19:10:59] <Burnt> undefined
[21:14:04] <shoky> Burnt: make a jsfiddle/testcase
