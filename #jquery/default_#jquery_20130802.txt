[00:07:34] <prit> hi
[00:07:59] <jop008> Any idea getting the source code for this http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-beta.1/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-page.html?
[00:11:51] <xec_> jop008: what do you mean, can't you just right click -> view source?
[00:11:53] <prit> basic of jquery
[00:12:05] <prit> some links to learn
[00:12:24] <jop008> yes I did but the resources you must also collect yourself
[00:12:26] <xec_> prit: http://learn.jquery.com/
[00:12:47] <prit> thankx Xec
[00:13:43] <xec_> jop008: I'm still not sure what you mean
[00:14:01] <xec_> jop008: you're askin where you can download jquery mobile?
[00:14:04] <xec_> asking*
[00:14:11] <jop008> download content slider demo
[00:16:25] <xec_> isn't that exactly what you linked to?
[00:37:50] <guest13123> hi all, if i have a <tr> with 2 <tds> with an input inside each td, how do i access the next td's inner input from the first?
[00:37:59] <guest13123> <tr>
[00:38:33] <guest13123> i'm trying to do an onkeyup, then call a web service and populate the 2nd input
[00:38:51] <guest13123> there are many rows and i can't assign an id to each of the textboxes
[00:47:50] <jop008> it is in the demo package in the jqm zip swipe demo
[00:48:09] <guest13123> jqm demo?
[01:01:19] <jop008> is it pssible to trigger an event by code like an onclick event?
[01:02:26] <ksz> hi, I'm using the datatable plugin on a table which is not present when the dom is loaded. Is there a way to "delegate" the initialization of the datatable or should I just init it when my table is there?
[01:03:34] <sonOfRa> jop008, do you need the EVENT, or do you need to do what happens when the event happens?
[01:03:45] <sonOfRa> If the latter, don't fire an event, just call the function called when the event happens
[01:19:11] <rauhahe> Hello all, any idea when http://bugs.jquery.com/ will be back?
[01:20:44] <bezhermoso> Hi guys, is there a channel specifically for jquery plugin development? :)
[01:26:56] <xec_> bezhermoso: nope
[01:27:41] <xec_> bezhermoso: just ask your question here
[01:35:21] <jop008> is it possible to shrink image size when I shrink the browser page?
[01:35:47] <xec_> jop008: you can give it a percentage width
[01:35:54] <jop008> so width and height dynamicly based on browser size
[01:36:09] <jop008> but that is set on advance
[01:36:39] <jop008> say full screen user resizes then picture must resize also
[01:36:39] <xec_> you could use media queries too of course
[01:37:41] <Reck> How can I detect if a user is "in" an input field?
[01:39:04] <jop008> I have this <div id='photodetails' style="max-height:50%;" whatever percentage I take no change
[01:39:46] <Reck> jop008: that depends on your parents size
[01:40:23] <jop008> i put it in  <img src tag but also no change
[01:40:43] <jop008> width:10% must be a smaller picture
[01:50:07] <quuxman> I'd like to keep track of the ajax requests in progress. Is the best / easiest way to do this to set ajaxStart, ajaxStop, etc handlers and manage the list myself?
[01:51:16] <snorti> when i use the jstorage of jstorage.info i get an TypeError: $.jStorage is undefined.. i aint get rid of it
[01:52:12] <snorti> i include all files in the head..
[01:52:24] <snorti> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/json2/20110223/json2.js"></script>
[01:52:24] <snorti> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
[01:52:37] <snorti> <script src="https://raw.github.com/andris9/jStorage/master/jstorage.js"></script>
[01:52:59] <huglester> do not include js from githjb
[01:53:06] <snorti> cause?
[01:53:08] <huglester> it has incorrect headers, and probably wion't work in IE
[01:53:14] <snorti> k
[01:53:21] <snorti> but this isnt my issue
[01:54:42] <snorti> i dont know why this fuck is undefined
[01:55:36] <christophercarls> Hello! I have a problem using .stop() to stop my animations when fired repeatedly.. I place the stop just before the .animate(). What am I doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/agurid/2/edit
[01:57:34] <webchao> good day, so i have several (backbone) models, all offering promises on .save(). now, i want to use the promises to force continuing the execution when all models are successfully saved. The models are stored in an array. Can i use something like $.when.apply(this, array_with_models); // assuming the .save() method has been called for every model in the array
[01:59:01] <webchao> somehow i still get utterly confused with promises and deferred :/
[02:01:24] <snorti> huglester: after i include it from my host. it works..
[02:01:26] <snorti> crazy shit
[02:05:48] <snorti> i want to change .html() when a radiobox is changed. how can i set that in jquery?
[02:06:12] <webchao> events?
[02:06:27] <snorti> ye
[02:06:37] <webchao> just do it then
[02:07:02] <webchao> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:07:03] <snorti> i am bludy new to it.. can you show me a fiddle?
[02:07:21] <webchao> read the docs, sorry, i am not here to do your homework
[02:08:10] <webchao> try to figure stuff out for yourself, present us a fiddle with your attempt and explain what isn't working, and then we can see again
[02:09:16] <webchao> its really not that difficult though. the link i provided should be enough
[02:10:21] <seutje> webchao: did you try it?
[02:10:36] <webchao> seutje: am at it
[02:10:45] <webchao> just wanted to get feedback if its even the right direction
[02:10:51] <seutje> yeah, should work
[02:10:56] <webchao> cool, thanks
[02:11:33] <snorti_> http://jsfiddle.net/GCCew/
[02:12:54] <webchao> snorti_: in this fiddle there is not a single line of js code :|
[02:13:14] <snorti_> ye let me try
[02:15:41] <webchao> seutje: conffirmed working. thanks
[02:17:19] <seutje> christophercarls: I don't see a stop in the example you posted, but generally you want to clear the queue and in most cases, jump to the end of the animation, check the docs on stop for possible arguments
[02:18:21] <snorti_> webchao: http://jsfiddle.net/GCCew/1/
[02:18:45] <snorti_> webchao: http://jsfiddle.net/GCCew/2/
[02:19:33] <snorti_> webchao: http://jsfiddle.net/GCCew/3/ i think i done it
[02:23:01] <snorti_> webchao: is there a bedder way to do that what i do there?
[02:25:04] <webchao> snorti_: yes, use change instead of mousedown
[02:25:24] <snorti_> hm
[02:26:10] <snorti_> cause?
[02:29:49] <seutje> radios can be changed without clicking
[02:29:54] <seutje> tab/arrow/spacebar
[02:30:21] <kubanc> hellow! I have a question about closest(). I don't understand how it works. If i have this example, there are some comment, please help... http://jsfiddle.net/DK8JD/
[02:30:24] <seutje> implementing a user-interface for triggering the change is up to the browser
[02:31:01] <seutje> snorti_: same thing with forms: bind to the "submit" event of the <form>, but the "click" event on the <button> or <input type="submit" />
[02:31:09] <seutje> s/but/not
[02:31:23] <kubanc> correcting my link: http://jsfiddle.net/DK8JD/1/
[02:32:14] <seutje> kubanc: closest finds the first parent matching the selector
[02:32:27] <seutje> whereas parents() match *all* parents matching the selector
[02:32:40] <bezhermoso> kubanc: Because you dont want to match every single .photos element within the page, just the ones within the .tour that contains the .see-photos clicked
[02:32:44] <kubanc> seutje: well ok, but why do we need to find it. I'm refering to the code in link
[02:32:57] <seutje> so closest comes down to a practical equivalent of .parents().first()
[02:33:08] <seutje> no wait, that's incorrect
[02:33:25] <seutje> that would return the parent that appears first in the DOM, I think
[02:35:02] <seutje> kubanc: you could probably replace $(this).closest(".tour").find(".photos") with $(this).next();
[02:35:27] <seutje> kubanc: your current implementation goes up the DOM tree and then back down to a sibling of the starting point
[02:35:33] <snorti_> seutje: ok thx
[02:35:44] <seutje> kubanc: but the current implementation allows them to not be direct siblings
[02:36:36] <snorti_> seutje: can you show me that change here http://jsfiddle.net/GCCew/3/
[02:36:41] <seutje> using $(this).next() would require photos to be a sibling of .tour and be right after it
[02:43:11] <seutje> snorti_: http://jsfiddle.net/GCCew/5/
[02:45:05] <jop008> On my jqM I have a text block and I want it to look nice. Some margin a border around the text how to do this ?
[02:45:11] <jop008> css I guess
[02:45:19] <kubanc> bezhermoso: coudn't we just use $(this).filter(".photos"). As far as I know this looks for class filter inside .see-photos
[02:45:45] <kubanc> bezhermoso: sorry, it filters all the ".photos" classes
[02:50:51] <aMoniker> Is there a way to get the cursor offset during a jQuery draggable's drag event?
[02:51:11] <aMoniker> I don't see it on the event variable, and the ui variable only seems to hold position info for the helper
[02:52:06] <aMoniker> ah, it's under event.originalEvent
[02:55:11] <CrysAk> any idea what i;m doing wrong.. "apprently" this is possible but i can;t get jquery to retun the file size before submitting form http://pastie.org/private/ekh29tjlbq70hefnrpyuzw
[02:57:18] <seutje> CrysAk: $("#file")[0].files[0].size
[02:57:42] <CrysAk> seutje, thanks, i'l give that a shot :)
[02:58:11] <seutje> CrysAk: see http://i.ndigo.com.br/2012/01/javascipt-checking-the-file-size/
[03:04:00] <CrysAk> seutje,  .. strange.. got it working from the onchange ... but can;t do it on submit only
[03:04:52] <CrysAk> never mind .. this will do, i'l check all files on adding and throw an alert IF >
[03:05:30] <CrysAk> is there a way to "while" throught he file array [0],[1],[2] etc IF that number of files has been uploaded
[03:05:41] * CrysAk tries to find out how to get number of files...
[03:06:00] <seutje> CrysAk: $("#file")[0].files.length
[03:06:14] <seutje> you can threat it as a normal array
[03:06:27] <CrysAk> sweet, thanks :D
[03:20:05] <CrysAk> what am i doing wrong here.. trying to cycle through an array of images in a form http://pastie.org/private/ubz1pycthm0dttqppjicjw
[03:23:26] <Doggie52> Is there still a difference between .click() and .on('click') ?
[03:23:36] <Doggie52> the documentation suggests the former is a shortcut to the latter
[03:25:35] <xec_> CrysAk: what is "this" in that context?
[03:25:57] <CrysAk> file submission in a form
[03:26:00] <xec_> meaning?
[03:26:08] <CrysAk> trying lots of differnt ways ot loop an array and can;t get any to work :(
[03:26:17] <CrysAk> html form, select files to upload
[03:26:20] <xec_> if you have a jquery
[03:26:23] <CrysAk> it's an array of files
[03:26:35] <xec_> so "this" is the <form> dom element? or
[03:26:41] <xec_> an array?
[03:26:51] <CrysAk> um.... sec

[03:29:29] <CrysAk> HOLY SHIT
[03:29:31] <CrysAk> let me try that again...
[03:29:33] <CrysAk> http://pastie.org/8199612
[03:29:35] <CrysAk> lol
[03:29:36] <xec_> lol
[03:29:37] * CrysAk pretends nothing happened
[03:29:46] <xec_> change nicks, quick :D
[03:29:57] <xec_> what is #file ?
[03:29:59] <CrysAk> ban hammer inc? :P
[03:30:02] <CrysAk> file is.. uh.. 1 secv
[03:30:29] * CrysAk checks paste is ok...
[03:30:31] <CrysAk> <input id="file" type="file" name="file[]" multiple="">
[03:30:51] <xec_> Doggie52: to answer your question, .click(func) is a shorthand for .on("click", func)
[03:31:12] <Doggie52> so using one or the other doesn't matter anymore?
[03:31:34] <CrysAk> basically i want to cycle through all the files just submitted intot he form, check their file size and throw an alert if ANY of the files exceed my limit
[03:31:40] <xec_> Doggie52: correct, although i'm not sure what you imply with the "anymore"
[03:31:45] <CrysAk> before submitting hte form...
[03:31:56] <xec_> Doggie52: the .on() syntax lets you do other things too though
[03:32:05] <Doggie52> I was under the impression that there was a difference back in earlier jquery versions
[03:32:18] <Doggie52> Everywhere I read keeps saying that .on('click' is better than click()
[03:32:48] <xec_> it's the same thing. always have been (although before it was .bind("click") instead of .on())
[03:37:01] <xec_> CrysAk: http://jsfiddle.net/pNLR2/
[03:38:09] <Doggie52> xec_, can you explain this, then? http://stackoverflow.com/a/11878976/2449750
[03:38:24] <Doggie52> oh never mind
[03:38:27] <Doggie52> I see
[03:39:35] <CrysAk> xec_,  lovelovelovelove
[03:40:27] <xec_> Doggie52: i assume you figured it out, but that answer is using delegate syntax
[03:40:45] <Doggie52> Yeah I forgot about the second parameter to on()
[03:56:42] <fabri77> hello, how can i put in a variable the value of the width of an image taken with the .load function?
[04:14:57] <CrysAk> need your expertiese again :(
[04:15:13] <CrysAk> i can get this working when the user adds a file via the form, but i can;t get it working whent he user clicks submit
[04:15:18] <CrysAk> http://pastie.org/private/dcwyofhrfjkvu9nrhgi7da
[04:15:57] <CrysAk> basically, it checks the file format and size whent he user selects it and throws a warning, and on submit, it should do the same and cancle the form upload .. but it's only showing the error on selection, not on submission
[04:19:34] <CrysAk> FIXED :D
[04:19:38] <CrysAk> forgot the [0]
[04:34:53] <jop008> I tried this   $( '#carousel' ).on( "swipeleft", page, function() {
[04:34:54] <jop008>  but no triggered
[04:35:07] <jop008> is swipeleft not standard in jqM?
[04:47:12] <jop008> swipeleft works on a touch device can I simulate it in the desktop browser (mouse swipe)
[04:48:54] <xec_> jop008: what is the page var?
[04:49:43] <jop008> page var ?
[04:49:49] <xec_> ).on( "swipeleft", page, function() {
[04:49:55] <xec_> what's page
[04:50:18] <jop008> yes this was undefined so now I have this 	$( '#carousel' ).swipeleft (function (e) {
[04:50:19] <jop008> w
[04:50:29] <jop008> which works on a touch device
[05:02:17] <jop008> You can emulate it with dragstart
[05:14:00] <RRR2> What does jQuery.cache and jQuery.guid do?
[05:17:06] <jop008> $("#carousel").bind('dragstart', function(event) { 	  console.log ( "drag start " + event.clientX ); undefined ?
[05:17:42] <jop008> can event be empty?
[05:22:19] <xec_> jop008: no, but clientX might be undefined
[05:29:35] <CiE> Hey guys
[05:30:09] <CiE> i have a issue with this http://paste.laravel.com/FSR when i click on the button to check all it does and when i click on it to check off it does, but if i tried again to check all it doesn't work any ideas?
[05:31:05] <sonOfRa> When i .clone() an element, and it had listeners attached (like draggable, droppable etc), are they copied, or do they have to be reapplied to the clone?
[05:31:23] <CiE> try it, but i believe they are cloned
[05:32:58] <sonOfRa> oh, it's a parameter to the clone function
[05:33:00] <sonOfRa> that makes sense
[05:49:56] <bahamas> what should I do if I want to activate a tooltip based on a condition? basically, on an input field's 'blur' event, I check the value of the field. if it meets a criteria, I initialize the tooltip and try to display it. the tooltip doesn't show up though
[05:50:05] <xec_> CiE: if you want to check/uncheck checkboxes, use .prop("checked", true) and .prop("checked", false)
[05:50:20] <MacroMan> Is there a convention as to what the href value should be in a link when I'm catching the click with jquery?
[05:50:34] <MacroMan> is "javascript:void(0);" fine?
[05:52:52] <slax0r> MacroMan, yes, or a # is fine as well
[05:52:53] <bahamas> MacroMan: I use href="#", because I've seen it used before. I don't know accepted it is
[05:52:55] <kftzg> MacroMan: I prefer '#' and canceling the event, just looks prettier when you mouse over
[05:53:06] <bahamas> aha, so it is
[05:53:22] <xec_> "#" has the side effect of scrolling to the top though
[05:53:26] <kftzg> MacroMan: or if the action has a potential canonical page, I link to it but cancel the event anyway
[05:53:37] <slax0r> xec_, it does not...it reloads the page
[05:53:38] <slax0r> :P
[05:53:46] <kftzg> xec_: not if you "return false;" or cancel it :D
[05:53:48] <xec_> slax0r: it does not reload the page
[05:53:50] <MacroMan> OK. Thanks for the advice.
[05:53:53] <bahamas> xec_: you prevent the default
[05:53:54] <slax0r> that's why you can return false, or prevent default
[05:54:02] <slax0r> xec_, oh ya it does..
[05:54:07] <bahamas> slax0r: it doesn't reload the page for me. it scrolls to the top
[05:54:16] <xec_> bahamas, kftzg: of course, but not if js is disabled or unavailable
[05:54:24] <MacroMan> I think I'll stick with javascript:void as # is used to link to certain parts of the page.
[05:54:27] <xec_> slax0r: why don't you try it and see
[05:54:28] <kftzg> xec_: quite true
[05:54:45] <kftzg> xec_: but who on earth would _dare_ to run w/o JS in this day'n'age?
[05:54:48] <kftzg> :D
[05:55:07] <xec_> i don't know, but i'm gonna hunt them down!!
[05:55:16] * xec_ picks up his trusty baseball bat
[05:55:20] * kftzg hands xec_ a baseball bat
[05:55:23] <xec_> rofl
[05:55:31] <MacroMan> kftzg, About 3% run without js if I remember rightly.
[05:55:35] <bahamas> so, any advice on how to activate tooltips conditionally?
[05:55:41] <xec_> i love that we both went directly for the baseball bat :P
[05:55:54] <kftzg> xec_: :D
[05:56:24] <xec_> bahamas: conditionally? use an if statement! :) :)
[05:56:51] <kftzg> bahamas: what kind of tooltip
[05:56:54] <xec_> bahamas: what do you have so far?
[05:57:01] <sammich> can you dynamically add meta tags and have the browser respond accordingly?
[05:57:23] <sammich> or vice versa (removing a tag and not have the browser behave as with it)
[05:58:19] <kftzg> sammich: i'd assume it depends on the browser - IIRC they don't necessarily handle dynamic tags after the page loads but it likely depends on what you're doing
[05:58:20] <sammich> just wondering cuz if you have a bit of JS code that removed a refresh meta tag that sends you to 'Turn on JS or else I beat you with a wooden baseball bat'.com
[05:58:39] <kftzg> lol
[05:58:49] <bahamas> kftzg: I guess that's my first question to answer. I'm using a theme that is based on boostrap which modified the default jquery tooltip plugin from what I see
[05:59:13] <xec_> sammich: lol
[05:59:35] <sammich> bahamas: http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#method-open
[05:59:37] <CiE> xec_: thank you very much it works great now
[05:59:48] * xec_ high fives CiE
[06:00:50] <bahamas> xec_: this is what I have basically http://bpaste.net/show/Ca2mfkO11gIiE3lrmGB6/
[06:01:06] <kftzg> sammich: that's tricky - seems a bit kludgy - i like modernizr or just to add a class to the body on dom load, and style the page as "you suck don't come bak no mo" rather than redirectly
[06:01:11] <bahamas> sammich: yes, I tried that, but I get an error somewhere in boostrap. I don't understand where the error comes from
[06:01:11] <kftzg> -ly +ing
[06:01:37] <gonnarule> hi people
[06:01:50] <sonOfRa> http://bpaste.net/show/F7HU5F6vS6wJx7ladm1s/ I'm trying to apply a handler to an element, but that handler creates this element. How do I solve this (infinite?) recursion?
[06:01:52] <sammich> the solution is far more obivouls
[06:01:56] <slax0r> I have to admit, I was wrong...The favicon is changed for a split second tho, and it lead me to believe that the site is reloaded :)
[06:02:09] <sammich> a noscript tag with a style that hides everything but your 'message'
[06:02:40] <sammich> no idea what happened to obvious
[06:03:04] <kftzg> sammich: yea, still might have to style / disable the rest or parts of the page tho
[06:03:12] <sammich> easy
[06:03:29] <sammich> * { display:none; } .message { display:block !important; }
[06:03:41] <kftzg> heh
[06:03:50] <bahamas> sammich: this is the error http://bpaste.net/show/WylflYoi3ofZW5zl6Day/
[06:04:26] <xec_> sammich: wouln't that hide the body (and any .message inside it) ?
[06:04:34] <xec_> wouldn't*
[06:04:36] <sammich> bahamas: kinda hard to diagnose with just that
[06:04:45] <sammich> fine
[06:04:55] <bahamas> sammich: tell me about it
[06:05:00] <grafi> oô
[06:05:07] <grafi> whats so !important
[06:05:14] <sammich> body > *:not(#message) { display:none; }
[06:05:22] <xec_> :D
[06:05:50] <gonnarule> hi, anyone with Liferay knowledge here ? I would like to add some jquery library to my portal and don't know where to put files and what to configure
[06:06:04] <grafi> wtf is liferay
[06:06:12] <xec_> what grafi said
[06:06:21] <kftzg> "Enterprise open source portal and collaboration software."
[06:06:26] <grafi> aah
[06:06:28] <grafi> java
[06:06:29] <sammich> it's a gun that gives you life
[06:06:30] <sammich> duh
[06:06:37] <grafi> naturally nobody has ever heard of it
[06:06:54] <xec_> that's a bit harsh
[06:07:03] <grafi> sorry gonnarule i have no idea :|
[06:07:06] <xec_> obviously the author has heard of it. and gonnarule.
[06:07:09] <grafi> its not though xec_
[06:07:11] <sammich> at least firefox is hiding the 'disable JS' option from users
[06:07:24] <grafi> finally
[06:07:25] <kftzg> gonnarule: since they're an enterprise solution, they likely have support channels you can fallback on :)
[06:07:32] <aMoniker> Is there a good way to get the elements at a particular x/y coordinate?
[06:07:34] <grafi> who wants to disable js anyways
[06:07:41] <sammich> don't get me started on blackbox portals
[06:07:44] <aMoniker> Particularly the x/y coordinate within another element
[06:08:04] <xec_> aMoniker: you can get the offset of a particular element, but not the other way afaik
[06:08:10] <sammich> aMoniker: possibly by looping through all your elements
[06:08:18] <aMoniker> sammich: that's not a good way
[06:08:27] <xec_> it might be the only way
[06:08:35] <sammich> well, chances are you only have a limited subset of elements you want to check this on
[06:08:37] <joe> hey guys, i have a statusfunction that is fire before a (synchronous) jquery post. the Status is shown if i go like showstatus(); alert('bla'); but not if i just put it infront of the post function. any ideas? iam turning insane
[06:08:38] <xec_> which makes it the best way, by definition ;)
[06:08:48] <aMoniker> there's document.elementFromPoint(x, y), but I'm not sure about the compatibility
[06:08:55] <sammich> otherwise, you have to put a bunch of mousehover event pairs
[06:09:15] <sammich> that's probably a nicer options
[06:09:19] <sammich> -s
[06:09:44] <gonnarule> kftzg : sadly their support is... well.. lets not talk about that :)
[06:09:54] <xec_> aMoniker: there's probably a better way of achieving what you want, though, what's the use case?
[06:09:59] <kftzg> aMoniker: compat: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_cssom.html#documentview
[06:10:18] <sammich> oh wow
[06:10:21] <sammich> look at that
[06:10:22] <grafi> not even documentation gonnarule ?
[06:10:42] <aMoniker> kftzg: more supported than I guessed, thanks
[06:10:46] <sammich> I build solutions on an IBM platform
[06:10:50] <kftzg> aMoniker: yep!
[06:10:57] <aMoniker> kftzg: have you used it before?
[06:11:17] <sammich> their documentation is, at best, just wrong
[06:11:50] <grafi> gonnarule http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8312928/adding-jquery-plugins-in-liferay ?
[06:11:51] <kftzg> aMoniker: not recently, unfortunately, some time ago when making a HTML/CSS game
[06:12:07] <aMoniker> kftzg: it returns the topmost element, right?
[06:12:16] <sammich> our DB guy spent the last 4 weeks trying to migrate our DBs to DB2
[06:12:54] <xec_> aMoniker: that's awesome, i had no idea it existed.
[06:13:05] <gonnarule> grafi : I saw that already but did not help. Thanks though
[06:13:29] <grafi> seems like it should be the answer though :P
[06:13:31] <grafi> oh well
[06:13:47] <gonnarule> All the info I found are theme related or not for the goof version of liferay
[06:50:53] <bahamas> ok, about earlier. I figured out I was using boostrap tooltip. that's why there was an error. one question that I have is: how can I fade out a tooltip if I'm using the 'manual' trigger?
[07:14:47] <bahamas> if I do var tooltips = $('selector').tooltip(options); tooltips.tooltip('show'), shouldn't this work?
[07:26:56] <BillCriswell> bahamas: Depends on the plugin I'd imagine.
[07:28:03] <bahamas> BillCriswell: I'm using bootstrap's tooltip
[07:29:20] <BillCriswell> bahamas: Seems like it should work. I'd set up a fiddle.
[07:29:47] <brianV> quick question - when I am implementing a click() callback, the element clicked on is held in 'this'. How can I find a specific sibling of 'this'? obviously, this.siblings() gives me a list of all siblings, but I only want those that match a certain selector
[07:31:35] <grafi> .siblings('selector') should work fine i think
[07:31:44] <brianV> grafi: ah, awesome
[07:35:28] <dopie> hey guys
[07:41:23] <bahamas> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/jeNzF/2/
[07:42:31] <brianV> grafi: yep, that worked - thanks. Amazing the things you don't think to try as a jQuery n00b ;)
[07:43:04] <grafi> ;)
[07:46:34] <BillCriswell> bahamas: This works. I've update it with the right externals: http://jsfiddle.net/jeNzF/4/
[07:47:58] <bahamas> oh, I had put the html tags as well
[07:47:59] <BillCriswell> bahamas: You should be running this on the form submit though, not the submit buttons click. They seem like the same thing but it's very different. ( You can press "enter" and submit the form without running this ).
[07:48:16] <BillCriswell> bahamas: Huh?
[07:48:25] <bahamas> BillCriswell: I mean in the resources links
[07:49:37] <BillCriswell> So you're good?
[07:50:05] <bahamas> BillCriswell: in my actual case there are several buttons that can submit the same form. I want this to trigger only when clicking save though
[07:50:10] <bahamas> BillCriswell: no, not yet
[07:50:46] <BillCriswell> bahamas: Okie doke.
[07:51:47] <aldodelgado> Is there a way to trigger query at the end of a youtube video?
[07:51:53] <aldodelgado> jquery*
[07:52:37] <bahamas> I don't see what's different between that fiddle and my code
[07:52:45] <sammich> how much would you pay for your <lastname>.com?
[07:53:02] <bahamas> aldodelgado: your player might have some options
[07:53:04] <BillCriswell> sammich: $5.
[07:53:19] <sammich> that's less than I offered
[07:53:34] <aldodelgado> bahamas: This the thing I'm not using my own player. Its the default youtube player
[07:53:41] <grafi> sammich.com
[07:53:44] <grafi> y:
[07:53:52] <sammich> I own <lastname>1.com
[07:54:05] <BillCriswell> aldodelgado: You might have to use the youtube javascript api to get that functionality.
[07:54:06] <sammich> I offered a stack for just the lastname
[07:54:14] <sammich> just looks cool
[07:54:34] <aldodelgado> BillCriswell: Sounds promising i'll take a look at the documentation
[07:54:35] <sammich> small stack
[07:55:08] <grafi> my <lastname>.com is available
[07:55:11] <grafi> wohoo ^^

[07:55:40] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I'm related to these bozos.

[07:57:13] <BillCriswell> aldodelgado: Sweeeeeeeet.
[07:58:01] <grafi> what about criswell.me?
[07:58:18] <BillCriswell> It's some like.. email service thing.
[07:58:43] <grafi> hm thats crazy
[07:59:05] <sammich> I had considered the other route
[07:59:11] <sammich> buy my own TLD
[07:59:11] <grafi> <lastname>.de is also an email service oô+
[07:59:36] <grafi> is criswell a common name then?
[07:59:39] <BillCriswell> criswell.xxx looks pretty bad ass, but not sure of the kind of issues that can come up.
[07:59:56] <NoiseEee> criswell.carlos.danger.xxx
[08:00:20] <BillCriswell> That's a scary looking url.
[08:00:28] <sammich> hireme@criswell.xxx
[08:00:36] <BillCriswell> grafi: I really didn't think so, but I guess haha
[08:01:15] <grafi> yeah

[08:02:16] <BillCriswell> sammich: Haha

[08:02:42] <BillCriswell> x.com is some ebay thing but I have no idea what it'll actually do.

[08:04:38] <bahamas> BillCriswell: this is my actual code. can you see anything different enough from the fiddle that would make it not work? I can't. http://bpaste.net/show/Z1vv1o9I4r2dAfe2Zk8i/
[08:05:14] <graphettion> Sounds pretty broad and vague.
[08:05:15] <BillCriswell> sammich: Sucks ebay got x.com
[08:06:31] <BillCriswell> It's a bad ass domain name.
[08:06:57] <grafi> bahamas and the console.log is actually called?
[08:08:21] <bahamas> grafi: yes
[08:08:47] <BillCriswell> bahamas: Try window.setTimeout(function(){ $tooltip.tooltip('hide') }, 3000);
[08:08:53] <grafi> yeah
[08:08:56] <grafi> thats it
[08:09:38] <bahamas> well, there's still the fact that the tooltip is never shown in the first place
[08:10:01] <BillCriswell> bahamas: You're hiding it immediately ( I believe ).
[08:10:23] <BillCriswell> setTimeout( doSomething(), 3000 ) <-- This won't wait 3 seconds.
[08:10:34] <BillCriswell> setTimeout( doSomething, 3000 ) <-- This will.
[08:10:55] <sammich> yeah, that's because () invokes

[08:21:04] <sammich> MAC address?
[08:22:13] <CiE|Work> no the machine id
[08:22:21] <CiE|Work> or mb serial number
[08:22:31] <sammich> are you in the right channel?
[08:23:02] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what a motherboard really is.
[08:23:14] <dopie> works perfectly!
[08:23:44] <dopie> BillCriswell,  how would i be able to tell it to load once and when the user returns to the same page it doesnt load again
[08:24:00] <kai> cookie?
[08:24:07] <kai> hmm, cookie...
[08:24:09] <dopie> yes
[08:24:12] <dopie> :)
[08:24:17] <kai> great, now I'm hungry
[08:24:30] <dopie> never used j with cookies
[08:24:30] <dopie> :)
[08:24:32] <sammich> localStorage
[08:24:37] <sammich> mmmmm
[08:24:52] <BillCriswell> kai: I used to think that whenever I used a jquery cookie plugin. It was named like jquery.cookie.packed.js
[08:24:59] <BillCriswell> All I thought about was packs of cookies.
[08:25:03] <sammich> you'll never get hungry with localStorage
[08:25:08] <sammich> because it never expires
[08:25:20] <BillCriswell> sammich: Hiyoooooo
[08:25:30] * sammich bows
[08:26:54] <BillCriswell> localStorage is fun.
[08:27:07] <kai> hm, never played with that
[08:27:20] <kai> maybe I should, at some point
[08:27:29] <BillCriswell> kai: It's pretty easy to go about.
[08:27:43] <sammich> if you stick an object into LS, does it go in as a JSON friendly format?
[08:27:51] <sammich> I guess I can easily check
[08:28:27] <BillCriswell> It's all strings.
[08:28:47] <sammich> yeah, but is it in a literal format
[08:28:48] <BillCriswell> Would need parse and stringify.
[08:29:04] <sammich> {key:value}
[08:29:51] <sammich> yeah, you have to stringify it
[08:46:09] <jonkristian_wrk> On line 30, $(this) doesn't work, any ideas why? http://pastie.org/8200443
[08:46:41] <jonkristian_wrk> .product-image is a text input field
[08:46:57] <jonkristian_wrk> several, that's why i need to target $(this)
[08:47:29] <duch_kazatel> fyi the live() method has been superceded in recent versions of jquery.
[08:48:01] <BillCriswell> jonkristian_wrk: What do you expect $(this) to be? It's a select element at line 30.
[08:48:01] <jonkristian_wrk> ok, i'll look into that. however that doesn't have anything to do with $(this) or does it?
[08:48:11] <duch_kazatel> console.log on $(this) and see if you can't get info about the object.
[08:48:24] <jonkristian_wrk> BillCriswell, i expect it to be the element that is clicked.
[08:48:41] <BillCriswell> jonkristian_wrk: It's a select element
[08:49:14] <BillCriswell> You need to do like... $link = $(this); after e.preventDefault(); and you can use $link when you want to reference the link.
[08:49:33] <duch_kazatel> ^ that's usually save.
[08:49:42] <BillCriswell> $(this).val() thinking it's a link also doesn't seem right.
[08:50:03] <duch_kazatel> you want to persist the original context because the underlying this object in javascript can change.
[08:50:41] <jonkristian_wrk> that worked!
[08:50:49] <jonkristian_wrk> Thanks a lot :)
[08:50:55] <BillCriswell> jonkristian_wrk: Really?
[08:50:58] <BillCriswell> Well... ok.
[08:51:29] <jonkristian_wrk> yup
[08:51:58] <jonkristian_wrk> BillCriswell, Why were you surprised?
[08:52:47] <BillCriswell> jonkristian_wrk: What kind of element is .product-image ?
[08:52:59] <BillCriswell> Duh
[08:53:03] <BillCriswell> You said text input.
[08:53:05] <BillCriswell> Ignore me.
[08:53:06] <jonkristian_wrk> BillCriswell, it's a text input field as stated earlier.
[08:53:16] <BillCriswell> Now it's making sense.
[08:53:16] <jonkristian_wrk> :)
[08:53:23] <BillCriswell> $link is a terrible name then.
[08:53:33] <BillCriswell> I'd use something that makes way more sense.
[08:53:53] <duch_kazatel> oftentimes people just automatically do something like $this = $(this) after running any more eventing stuff.
[09:02:15] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/imecup/1/edit I can't believe this works.
[09:02:56] <sammich> how do you mean?
[09:03:02] <sammich> $ is just a char like any other
[09:03:24] <BillCriswell> sammich: I'm talking about the use of commas.
[09:03:48] <duch_kazatel> where?  in attr?
[09:04:01] <sammich> comma?
[09:04:05] <BillCriswell> at the end of the lines.
[09:04:39] <BillCriswell> $div.addClass('foo'), $div.attr('id', 'something'), $div.data('something', 12)
[09:04:42] <BillCriswell> instead of semi colons.
[09:04:52] <duch_kazatel> welcome to javascript :)
[09:05:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I thought for sure it would be a parse error.
[09:17:24] <dopie> hey BillCriswell  can you put an example of the localStorage?
[09:17:49] <BillCriswell> localStorage.setItem('animationRan', '1')
[09:18:41] <BillCriswell> Then you can do like var animationRan = localStore.getItem('animationRan'); if( animationRan === '1' ) {}
[09:20:31] <BillCriswell> Maybe use 'true' instead of '1' and do like... animationRan = localStorage.getItem('animationRan') === 'true' ? true : false; then do if( animationRan )
[09:20:46] <BillCriswell> I hate strings when I don't need them.
[09:25:55] <BillCriswell> or just if (localStorage.getItem('animationRan'))
[09:25:56] <BillCriswell> Duh.
[09:27:06] <fission6> can someone recommend me a scroll lib, i have a left hand nav and some content in a div to the right i want to scroll to using anchors
[09:27:29] <sammich> but localStorage is string
[09:27:41] <BillCriswell> sammich: Yeah, but it'll return null if it's not defined.
[09:27:48] <sammich> oh, right
[09:27:54] <BillCriswell> As long as he doesn't set it to false...
[09:27:58] <BillCriswell> ok lunch time!
[09:28:05] <sammich> 230am now ;)
[10:04:34] <TGYoshi_> Hey all, I'm trying to make some thing that whenever you scroll past the menubar, the menubar will snap to the top of the screen. Current: http://pastebin.com/W7iP9Xvp - This works properly, but, whenever you scroll fast, there's a clearly noticable delay before the menubar snaps to the top (< 0.1 second), is there any way to fix that?
[10:34:33] <naeluh> yo!!!! where errrbody at !!
[10:34:53] <duch_kazatel> just ask your question.
[10:34:59] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will :)
[10:35:38] <naeluh> duch_kazatel: Hi cool I am formulating my question I will post ina sec I was just saying Hi :-)
[10:52:49] <andrew91841> can you do a callback on addclass? if not, are there any workarounds
[10:53:14] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: Just fun the callback after you add the class.
[10:53:26] <BillCriswell> run*
[10:53:38] <BillCriswell> Actually... fun can work there.
[10:53:49] <andrew91841> well, i'm using addClass to do a transition, and i want to make it run after the transition is done
[10:53:52] <andrew91841> hehe
[10:54:29] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: Ahhh...
[10:54:42] <BillCriswell> CSS transition?
[10:54:50] <andrew91841> yeah
[10:55:24] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: The only thing I could think of doing there is using a setTimeout for the duration of the animation.
[10:55:38] <andrew91841> hmm yeah
[10:55:44] <andrew91841> thats what i did :)
[10:55:51] <andrew91841> thanks Bill
[10:55:55] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9255279/callback-when-css3-transition-finishes perhaps?
[10:56:12] <BillCriswell> Wasn't aware fo animation end.
[10:56:30] <doug65536> I fetch a fragment of a page with $.ajax, options has cache: true, but it is cache-busting a script in the fragment
[10:56:53] <doug65536> why is ?_=<random big number> getting appended to the script url
[10:57:31] <andrew91841> 	hmm i'll try that
[10:57:32] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: If your transitions are simple maybe just put them into an .animate({}) ?
[10:57:55] <andrew91841> that is true, but that runs the eloquence of css class animations :P
[10:58:33] <BillCriswell> doug65536: If you have cache: true I am not sure why it would happen.
[10:58:41] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: Understood totally.
[11:00:41] <BillCriswell> I know jQuery UI extends .toggleClass() but I'm not sure if it'll not run the jQuery animations if the CSS is available...
[11:00:46] <BillCriswell> Would be awesome if it did.
[11:03:20] <andrew91841> yeah
[11:08:15] <andrew91841> whats your favourite plugin Bill ?
[11:09:01] <gf3> Prototype.js
[11:09:43] <BillCriswell> andrew91841: For what?
[11:12:52] <andrew91841> in general. just wondering if you had a fav :)
[11:13:18] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[11:13:45] <BillCriswell> Emmet for Sublime Text
[11:13:55] <BillCriswell> Unless we're talking jQuery.
[11:14:01] <grafi> emmet is crazy
[11:14:09] <BillCriswell> I love this shit.
[11:14:23] <grafi> totally
[11:14:38] <BillCriswell> I didn't find out it changed its name till way late so I was looking for "zen coding" and thought the project was just dead.
[11:15:12] <grafi> didnt package control tell you about it? ^^
[11:15:39] <BillCriswell> grafi: I had it installed on TextMate as zen coding and package control wasn't there for that haha.
[11:15:46] <grafi> ah
[11:15:48] <grafi> ok :P
[11:21:07] <naeluh> I like sublime text I have really become accustom to the mid-dark grey background cause I use autodesk and adobe so much and they have adopted it to some degree
[11:21:53] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it's just like TextMate enough for me to like it.
[11:22:06] <BillCriswell> There's on thing about it that bothers me but it's only because I'm lazy.
[11:22:15] <BillCriswell> one*
[11:22:20] <grafi> what is it?
[11:22:35] <naeluh> I use to use textmate when I had a mac
[11:23:21] <BillCriswell> grafi: In TextMate I was able to drag a file from the sidebar to my FTP program, but in sublime I have to go directly to the file in Finder.
[11:24:03] <BillCriswell> naeluh: I used Notepad, then TextMate, now SublimeText... I keep wanting to try vim but I just feel like an idiot in there.
[11:24:09] <grafi> seems like there should be a plugin for that ^^
[11:24:26] <naeluh> isnt that like command line text editing ?
[11:24:32] <grafi> vim seems awesome, but it looks awful on windows oô
[11:24:45] <grafi> and im too lazy to customize the look
[11:24:56] <neataroni> its worth the effort
[11:24:59] <grafi> so i just use vintage mode
[11:25:00] <grafi> :P
[11:25:00] <BillCriswell> naeluh: It terms your console into a text editor for a simple explanation.
[11:25:01] <neataroni> vim is awesome
[11:25:04] <BillCriswell> neataroni: That's what I hear.
[11:25:25] <neataroni> BillCriswell: independent from whatever actual tangible gains in productivity you get, its just cool and fun
[11:25:34] <neataroni> but the gains are many
[11:25:52] <neataroni> the one downside is that when you are editing text without it, you start hitting lots of random keys that dont do anything :)
[11:25:55] <naeluh> yeah I have used something like that sudo nano /path/to/file then edit I think it was
[11:26:12] <naeluh> on ubuntu
[11:26:32] <BillCriswell> neataroni: YEah, watching people who know how to use it well is mesmerizing, anyone else they just look kind of... slow.
[11:26:58] <BillCriswell> I have an s shortcut on the command line to open up files in sublimetext haha
[11:27:06] <naeluh> BillCriswell: I saw a demo with some drupal code that was pretty sweet
[11:27:38] <grafi> have a link naeluh ?
[11:28:00] <naeluh> let me see it was like upgrading a module to drupal 8 or something like that
[11:29:27] <naeluh> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HTafIHU21A#at=765
[11:29:32] <grafi> great
[11:29:33] <grafi> thanks
[11:30:01] <naeluh> yeah its webchick shes pretty awesome
[11:38:35] <andrew9184> yeah Emmet is pretty awesome
[11:38:44] <andrew9184> I was asking for a jquery one :P
[11:39:20] <grafi> if only all videos were in 1080p
[11:39:21] <grafi> xD
[11:45:06] <naeluh> grafi: just wait youll be saying a few years if only all videos were 4k haha
[11:45:08] <naeluh> :-)
[11:45:24] <naeluh> ina

[11:52:42] <TGYoshi_> Hey all, I'm trying to make some thing that whenever you scroll past the menubar, the menubar will snap to the top of the screen. Current: http://pastebin.com/W7iP9Xvp - This works properly, but, whenever you scroll fast, there's a clearly noticable delay before the menubar snaps to the top (< 0.1 second), is there any way to fix that?
[11:52:53] <grafi> naeluh: probably :D
[11:53:29] <grafi> This paste has been removed!
[11:53:33] <grafi> wohoo
[11:53:34] <grafi> ^^
[11:56:49] <grafi> after watching that video i really think i should hide my mouse and try navigating like a normal vim user ^^
[11:57:07] <grafi> but i think my "workflow" is not ready for that :x
[11:58:37] <naeluh> damn grafi you said I like my mouse and I think it serves a really interesting way of interfacing with computer I feel even I made to that type of workflow I would end reaching for my mouse all the time haha
[11:58:45] <naeluh> you siad it
[11:59:08] <naeluh> gez I can't type any way apparently
[12:01:23] <grafi> its not even that i constantly navigate around sublime text with my mouse .... but im still always switching to the browsers watching my changes ...
[12:01:38] <naeluh> totaly
[12:02:48] <naeluh> i just figured out what you meant - This paste has been removed!
[12:07:44] <TGYoshi_> Well, now it works :P http://pastebin.com/WhB3KqaT
[12:26:02] <t4nkd> Hey jQuery, I have this big collection of selectors that I need to traverse from each and toggle an ancestoral element for. This seems to take a really long time(there's probably ≈40 panes of content I want to reveal) -- what's a better approach for this that doesn't cause my click event to freeze things up for 2 seconds?
[12:29:38] <initself> how can i tell what the contents of this are?
[12:29:41] <initself> $('div#template').text().trim()
[12:29:53] <initself> i'm just trying to test if the div is empty of anything
[12:30:09] <janepe> initself: what do you mean? maybe .html() or .val()
[12:30:14] <initself> the div seems tohave a lot of whitespace in it
[12:30:38] <initself> console.log($('div#template').html());
[12:30:44] <initself> doesn't print anything
[12:30:59] <initself> .val() says 'any empty string'
[12:31:13] <BillCriswell> initself: .text() could work.
[12:31:16] <initself> so i just need to test if .val() is an empty sging?
[12:31:23] <initself> i've been trying .text()
[12:31:26] <janepe> initself: trim() return string
[12:31:27] <initself> for the past 30 minutes
[12:31:44] <initself> how do check for empy?
[12:31:47] <BillCriswell> initself: .val() is for inputs.
[12:31:54] <initself> BillCriswell: thanks
[12:32:13] <initself> .text() prints nothing to the console
[12:32:22] <initself> so i imagine it is empty in some way
[12:32:35] <initself> shouldn't: ! $('div#template').text() do it?
[12:32:39] <NoiseEee> initself: just $('#template')  not $('div#template'), correctly assuming there's only one thing with the id "template". always check your selectors are what you think they are
[12:32:56] <initself> ok
[12:33:15] <initself> same result there
[12:33:29] <BillCriswell> initself: What is your goal?
[12:33:35] <janepe>  try  $.trim($('div#template').text());  it should return string, try to print it
[12:33:49] <initself> this worked
[12:33:50] <initself> if( ! $('template').text() ) {
[12:33:56] <initself> however
[12:34:09] <BillCriswell> I'm so lost.
[12:34:25] <initself> $("#show_template_button").remove; << this didn't get rid of the button
[12:34:32] <NoiseEee> initself: remove()
[12:34:39] <initself> crap
[12:34:55] <NoiseEee> initself: we have no clue what your markup really is.  and $('template') != $('#template').
[12:34:55] <initself> NoiseEee++
[12:35:07] <NoiseEee> initself: it seems your selector is wrong; start THERE
[12:35:08] <initself> my issue is solved
[12:35:16] <Mrgoose> Hey have any of you used jquery waypoints with jquery mobile
[12:35:17] <initself> i have the right selectors and the right functions now
[12:36:24] <initself> i am on the wrong track here?
[12:36:25] <initself> $("#show_template_button").remove().closest('br').remove().closest('br').remove();
[12:36:30] <initself> can you chain after remove?
[12:36:46] <initself> just trying to remove the two tags immediately after the button
[12:38:59] <BillCriswell> initself: Try it and see.
[12:39:28] <initself> i did, i see no change
[12:39:58] <BillCriswell> There is your answer.
[12:40:18] <initself> ahhah!
[12:40:36] <NoiseEee> initself: make better markup. ditch <br> tags (why are they being used these days instead of CSS) and delete the *container* that hodls the button and other stuff
[12:40:59] <BillCriswell> .closest('br') would be impossible.
[12:41:16] <BillCriswell> For the record.
[12:41:21] <initself> NoiseEee: great idea
[12:41:58] <aldodelgado> Question? I using map to get my answers from radio buttons. However the last radio is being duplicated and I'm getting an extra answer thats unified. Any suggestions? http://pastebin.com/tW66hxjq
[12:43:47] <aldodelgado> Never mind I'm approaching this wrong
[12:43:50] <BillCriswell> aldodelgado: Should probably look into serializeArray()
[12:44:00] <aldodelgado> BillCriswell: I'll do that
[12:44:04] <BillCriswell> It'll save you a dick load of annoyances.
[12:44:46] <aldodelgado> BillCriswell: That exactly what I wanted
[12:45:07] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[12:45:28] <grafi> i feel like you took all the fun out of that problem now
[12:46:40] <BillCriswell> I'm such an asshole.
[12:46:52] <grafi> i think i have to agree
[12:50:51] <aldodelgado> BillCriswell: Worked like a charm!
[12:52:12] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[12:52:42] <initself> is this a silly way to check a list against a value?
[12:52:43] <initself> if ([18,33].indexOf(list_id) < -1) {
[12:55:00] <rook2pawn> is it possible to do a put from jquery
[12:57:20] <BillCriswell> initself: Why would that be silly?
[12:57:48] <BillCriswell> initself: It's the most solid way, just make sure you shim it for IE9-
[12:57:58] <BillCriswell> initself: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[13:00:26] <Dans> hi

[13:07:52] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:10:53] <rballou> hi everyone. I'm debugging some code that doesn't work with jQuery 1.8 (works with 1.4). The selector being used is: body:not(.class1|.class2). I can't seem to find anything that suggests that a pipe ("|") could be used like this. Does anyone know what that may have been intended for?
[13:20:03] <doug65536> rballou: I would suggest $('body').not('.class1,.class2')
[13:20:36] <rballou> doug65536: thanks. It looks like newer versions of the library are using that (just found it), so I suppose that's what they meant. :)
[13:20:50] <Mrgoose> Hey have any of you used jquery waypoints with jquery mobile
[13:32:12] <stack> is $ an object or a function ?
[13:32:32] <duch_kazatel> both :)
[13:32:36] <duch_kazatel> functions are objects.
[13:32:44] <stack> actually I was expecting it :)
[13:32:50] <naeluh> Mrgoose: looks pretty cool but I don't know if its set up for mobile but not sure
[13:32:50] <stack> thanks
[13:33:25] <Krinkle> anything not a primitive (null/undefined/bool/number/stirng) is an object in javascript. including arrays and functions
[13:34:26] <Krinkle> and even primitives are temporary converted to an object when attempting access a property on them
[13:35:33] <Krinkle> stack: You stack.nl ?
[13:36:14] <Krinkle> e.g. from Doxygen
[13:36:19] <Krinkle> oh, nvm, that's dimitri
[13:39:27] <stack> Krinkle: no
[13:52:32] <bongjovi> If I have a parent div with two div children, is it possible to append a div to the parent, but BETWEEN the two children div?
[13:53:09] <duch_kazatel> bongjovi - yes.  can'
[13:53:19] <bongjovi> phew, that's a relief
[13:53:21] <duch_kazatel> *can't remember the method name, but it's something like .before()
[13:53:28] <bongjovi> thanks duch_kazatel, i'll take a look
[13:53:32] <duch_kazatel> np.
[13:53:36] <bongjovi> just wanted to check that something like that was possiblw
[13:53:38] <bongjovi> possible*
[13:54:04] <bongjovi> looks like before is what i need, thanks.
[13:54:36] <duch_kazatel> not a problem.
[13:55:36] <aldodelgado> Can anyone tell me why my $this->request->data is empty from an ajax request? I'm using RequestHandler
[13:55:54] <aldodelgado> Am I missing forgetting something?
[13:56:13] <aldodelgado> I see the url with all the parameters
[13:57:03] <duch_kazatel> wat?  code example?
[13:57:08] <aldodelgado> ok
[13:58:41] <bongjovi> it removes the original div too! fan bloody tastic, i love this method.
[13:58:48] <aldodelgado> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1475017080
[13:59:58] <duch_kazatel> aldodelgado - so what's the problem here?  data is empty?
[14:00:16] <duch_kazatel> and bongjovi oh does it?  nice.
[14:00:24] <aldodelgado> duch_kazatel: Well I can get the data from the $_POST but not $this->request->data
[14:00:47] <duch_kazatel> aldodelgado I have never seen any javascript/jquery that's formatted $this->request->data.
[14:00:49] <aldodelgado> $this->request->data is an empty array
[14:00:59] <duch_kazatel> what are you talking about?  how are you accessing that data?
[14:01:54] <aldodelgado> Hold please I get you the code in the controller
[14:02:24] <duch_kazatel> is the controller written in javascript/jquery?
[14:03:39] <NoiseEee> aldodelgado: seems like your issue is with cakephp, i'd head there for support #cakephp
[14:03:43] <aldodelgado> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1475017080
[14:03:54] <aldodelgado> wow
[14:04:01] <aldodelgado> sorry about that I'm in the wrong channel
[14:04:02] <aldodelgado> :-P
[14:04:16] <duch_kazatel> hah, yeah, thought something seemed wrong.
[14:12:19] <Wolf_22> How would one get .post() response data to debug? I.e. - does it generate any kind of error output, outcome data, etc.?
[14:13:02] <ericelliott> wolf_22: look at the server logs? Mock the endpoint and log the post request?
[14:13:52] <Wolf_22> ericelliott: So if I'm submitting a .post() call and nothing shows up on my end, it could be working? (I'm mostly a guy who deals with forms here, so I'm expecting something to happen. :) )
[14:15:16] <ericelliott> wolf_22: yeah.. you can look at the browser network log and see if you got a header response, at least.
[14:16:26] <Wolf_22> ericelliott: Yep, I've been trying to use Firebug in this and when I look at the headers' response, it's blank... (Which makes me believe that either I'm not sending things correctly or else the server might be messed up. ...probably the prior.)
[14:16:39] <ericelliott> Wolf_22: You'll probably get a 200, 201, or 202 status code if it worked.
[14:17:33] <ericelliott> Wolf_22: Try posting with curl -v and see if you can learn anything.
[14:17:46] <Wolf_22> ericelliott: Now I did get a Status of 200 OK... (I was thinking though that maybe some data should be coming back in the response header.) --I'll give that a try.
[14:18:10] <ericelliott> 200 OK means it worked.
[14:18:40] <Wolf_22> ericelliott: Ah, okay, then I'll need to contact our server admin guy to see what we can see in the logs. Thanks. :)
[14:24:01] <naeluh> wait a second is it not possible to chnage the width of a select box?
[14:24:25] <eddiemonge> depends on the browser
[14:27:07] <neataroni> when i use http://pastebin.com/EvVuwZi0 to make a post request, ajaxStop never fires, even though the response is a 201. Is it because its not getting back json in the body?
[14:27:34] <neataroni> wait, it actually is getting json back
[14:27:53] <neataroni> why wouldn't jquery fire the ajaxStop event?
[14:28:13] <naeluh> yeah weird
[14:28:50] <bongjovi> what would be the wisest method of replacing the numerical part of a string, say "item-2" with that number + 2, so "item-2" would become "item-4", "item-3" would become "item-5", etc?
[14:29:51] <neataroni> maybe not the wisest, but q'n'd: split on -, cast to int, increment 2 concatenate with first part (automatically turns back to string)
[14:29:54] <bongjovi> split it after item- and parse integer?
[14:29:59] <bongjovi> ah
[14:30:14] <bongjovi> okay, that makes sense i guess
[14:30:19] <bongjovi> i'll give it a try, thanks
[14:32:50] <dopie> BillCriswell, hey!!!
[14:33:00] <dopie> I need your jquery aceness
[14:33:01] <dopie> :)
[14:38:16] <bongjovi> neataroni, something like: "item-"+(parseInt(divID.split('-')[1])+2);
[14:38:29] <dopie> Why isnt this working
[14:38:34] <bongjovi> divID being say, "item-3"
[14:38:37] <dopie> http://pastie.org/8201247
[14:38:41] <bongjovi> is that what you would suggest?
[14:39:00] <neataroni> bongjovi: does it work? :)
[14:39:19] <Mrgoose> $(document).live('pagebeforehide', function() { , how come this doesn't work in 1.4.0alpha
[14:39:32] <bongjovi> yep, just wondering if it's a bad way to do it, haha. i'm pretty new at this.
[14:45:55] <eddiemonge> Mrgoose: because live is deprecated
[14:46:02] <eddiemonge> and removed
[14:46:05] <dopie> Mrgoose,  anyhelp with my animation???
[14:46:08] <dopie> ugh
[14:46:12] <dopie> wth am i doing wrong
[14:46:13] <Mrgoose> eddiemonge, ah
[14:46:25] <dopie> http://pastie.org/8201247
[15:05:38] <dopie> ok
[15:05:41] <dopie> i got 1 part working
[15:05:42] <dopie> :)
[15:05:43] <dopie> woohoo
[15:05:45] <dopie> http://pastie.org/8201330
[15:05:55] <dopie> now how do i also tell it to change colors????
[15:09:44] <eindoofus> hi, I would like to create a simplified version of Google Docs using HTML5/JS which allows a user to type text into there browser and have other users on different machines see that text appear in their own browser. The other users would also be able to type text.
[15:10:33] <eindoofus> Does anyone have any idea how I can approach this problem? My mind is still back in the Java world of 2005.
[15:11:22] <sirecote> eindoofus: like https://github.com/ether/pad ?
[15:11:26] <doug65536> eindoofus: probably mostly server-side work to get that working
[15:11:53] <doug65536> how do they handle conflicts?
[15:12:22] <doug65536> what if I highlight what you are typing and delete it
[15:12:58] <eindoofus> sirecote: what is that designed in? is there a web server involved?
[15:14:11] <sirecote> https://github.com/ether/pad/blob/master/INSTALL
[15:14:57] <doug65536> well, my first attempt would be to implement an event system where I can submit to the server what the user is doing to the document, and have a way for the other clients to wait for and receive all the events since their last check
[15:15:41] <gsteinbrenner> re: handling conflicts, look into this strategy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation
[15:42:23] <delinquentme> https://gist.github.com/delinquentme/6144053
[15:42:29] <delinquentme> anyone have a way to do this cleaner?
[15:46:03] <duch_kazatel> why not craft the stuff you want to append first, then run a single append?
[15:47:09] <duch_kazatel> protip: always minimize the amount of times you insert/append/remove/etc content from the visible document.
[15:47:18] <duch_kazatel> look up document fragments and rejoice.
[15:48:39] <eindoofus> I'm curious, how is something like https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite able to communicate between different clients from a browser? Sorry, my understanding of the Internet is from a decade ago.
[15:51:10] <eindoofus> Is it through WebSockets?
[15:51:10] <gsteinbrenner> ein: the different clients don't communicate with each other, they all communicate with one server
[15:51:33] <eindoofus> How do they communicated with the server?
[15:51:39] <eindoofus> communicate*
[15:51:54] <gsteinbrenner> not sure.. the list of dependencies for the node.js server does include socket.io which is WebSockets
[15:52:10] <gsteinbrenner> not sure if that's the only way they communicate or if it's one of a few possible ways
[15:52:18] <gsteinbrenner> here's the list I'm looking at https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/develop/src/package.json
[15:52:28] <eindoofus> what could be there other possibilities?
[15:52:54] <eindoofus> if another project besides this one communicated between browser and server realtime?
[15:53:49] <gsteinbrenner> before WebSockets came along people did stuff like HTTP polling (lots of http requests over and over)
[15:53:52] <gsteinbrenner> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology
[15:54:07] <gsteinbrenner> but WebSockets is the best modern option
[15:55:15] <eindoofus> How does REST fit into the picture? I hear that word tossed around
[15:56:28] <gsteinbrenner> huh I'm bad at explaining REST but it is basically a style for designing your URLs
[15:56:57] <gsteinbrenner> where it looks like http://server/fruit/apple instead of http://server/getFruit.cgi?type=apple
[15:56:58] <eindoofus> Oh, so it's more about web pages than anything realitime?
[15:57:04] <gsteinbrenner> Yeah
[15:57:20] <duch_kazatel> what.
[15:57:31] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah, REST is an API design principle
[15:57:53] <eindoofus> cool, I gotta get going but thanks for your help.
[15:58:08] <duch_kazatel> Representational state transfer (REST) - you tend to use verbs the way they're meant.  Forms have "GET" and "SUBMIT" - use them appropriately.
[15:58:09] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[15:58:37] <eindoofus> thanks :)
[15:58:49] <lenovo`> hello
[15:58:53] <lenovo`> anyone
[15:59:43] <lenovo`> brbrbrb
[15:59:48] <titii> hi
[15:59:56] <lenovo`> hey
[16:00:05] <lenovo`> tell me about jquery
[16:00:16] <duch_kazatel> wat
[16:00:22] <lenovo`> without jumping at me to google it
[16:00:22] <duch_kazatel> what do you want to know?
[16:00:24] <lenovo`> or use help
[16:00:30] <lenovo`> how to use to with irc
[16:00:34] <lenovo`> to inject commands
[16:00:37] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[16:00:38] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[16:00:41] <duch_kazatel> that's not what jquery does.
[16:00:46] <lenovo`> then what it does
[16:00:57] <titii> How can I put some content into days cells in a datepicker calendar???
[16:01:05] <doug65536> jquery lets you do DOM operations, asynchronous ajax, css manipulations, and animations easily
[16:01:16] <duch_kazatel> it's an abstraction against javascript.
[16:01:49] <duch_kazatel> and titii that question doesn't make sense/
[16:01:51] <duch_kazatel> code example please.
[16:02:16] <lenovo`> then guys, how can I hack irc
[16:02:22] <lenovo`> I want to play around alittle
[16:02:31] <lenovo`> how to inject code there
[16:02:34] <duch_kazatel> "hack irc"?
[16:02:36] <duch_kazatel> "inject code"?
[16:02:39] <duch_kazatel> wtf are you trying to do?
[16:02:40] <lenovo`> yah
[16:02:44] <lenovo`> playng
[16:02:50] <lenovo`> bored and thought to have some fun
[16:02:56] <doug65536> lenovo`: I hate to break it to you but IRC isn't a web page thing
[16:02:57] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[16:03:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah you're going to have to learn how to, y'know, code.
[16:03:45] <lenovo`> yes I do
[16:03:48] <lenovo`> then what is irc
[16:03:57] <duch_kazatel> you're using it?
[16:04:02] <duch_kazatel> it's internet relay chat.
[16:04:03] <lenovo`> yes
[16:04:08] <titii> this is the script http://pastebin.com/g9aVc9E8
[16:04:16] <duch_kazatel> please use jsfiddle.
[16:04:26] <titii> see the "beforeShow"
[16:04:35] <lenovo`> internet relay chat means
[16:04:37] <titii> jsfiddle sometime doesnt works
[16:04:47] <duch_kazatel> that's because the code example you put in is incomplete ;)
[16:05:43] <titii> duch_kazatel: that mean, this is an example, ofcourse the function is bad. I need some solution to make the addapt like this
[16:05:45] <titii> u know<
[16:05:48] <titii> ?
[16:06:25] <duch_kazatel> not in context.
[16:06:58] <duch_kazatel> your explanation didn't make sense, either.
[16:08:01] <doug65536> http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
[16:08:47] <doug65536> what are you going to "hack" anyway? it's a chat protocol
[16:10:36] <gsteinbrenner> I do my banking over IRC, don't take my money please
[16:13:16] <naeluh> hey can someone look at this I want to check if a selection has been made then show this and then if a checkbox has been checked show this here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/xjeRD/
[16:16:45] <doug65536> naeluh: line 13 doesn't make sense
[16:16:53] <doug65536> you're missing $() ?
[16:17:04] <titii> I NEED, when u appear the calendar, the days u will not see 11., 12, 13, 14, ... but 11. name1, 12. name2, 13.name3, 14.name4,
[16:17:25] <doug65536> naeluh: if (<string>) is always true
[16:17:43] <doug65536> naeluh: line 18 is an assignment, you probably mean ==
[16:18:23] <naeluh> doug65536:  yeh ok I am just trying to see if any of those select options are selected  is there a better way to that ?
[16:19:31] <naeluh> exhibit_1.length => 1
[16:19:37] <doug65536> naeluh: you understand what I said right?
[16:19:42] <naeluh> yes
[16:19:46] <naeluh> thanks
[16:19:47] <doug65536> if ("some string of text") is always true
[16:19:57] <doug65536> you need $() around it
[16:20:04] <naeluh> ok
[16:20:21] <doug65536> naeluh: it looks good overall
[16:20:46] <doug65536> naeluh: you might need to be careful if exhibit_1 etc have & or < in them
[16:20:47] <jabagawee> google's old chart api (https://developers.google.com/chart/image/) responds to ajax calls with a PNG file, how should my success callback handle that if i want to display it?
[16:21:22] <naeluh> ok doug65536 I will tread lightly
[16:21:29] <naeluh> haha
[16:21:49] <doug65536> naeluh: this is homework right?
[16:22:04] <naeluh> yeah totally
[16:30:15] <doug65536> jabagawee: what do you mean "with a png file". with a URL?
[16:30:22] <jabagawee> nope, just raw png data
[16:30:45] <doug65536> you should construct an img tag with the src pointing to it
[16:31:52] <abc2> Under wich license is jQuery and jQueryUI?
[16:31:59] <snover> ask google
[16:32:38] <abc2> ist the MIT right?
[16:35:01] <doug65536> jabagawee: do you know what I mean?
[16:35:20] <jabagawee> doug65536: no i do not :( i'm currently trying to set up a quick jsfiddle
[16:36:06] <doug65536> jabagawee: whatever the url you use for the ajax, instead do var the_image = $("<img>").attr("src", <the url here>)
[16:36:27] <doug65536> and use .append or something to place it into the document
[16:36:41] <doug65536> or just modify an img already in the document with .attr("src", <the url>)
[16:36:55] <jabagawee> how do i make the post request then?
[16:37:09] <jabagawee> it works for a GET request, but POST won't work like that, afaik
[16:37:28] <doug65536> jabagawee: it's a post? how do they expect you to use raw png data from ajax?
[16:37:37] <bongjovi> How would I pass a variable I defined in mouseenter to mouseleave?
[16:37:44] <jabagawee> doug65536: i honestly have no clue
[16:37:57] <doug65536> jabagawee: it might help if you showed your code
[16:38:25] <doug65536> jabagawee: are you sure it has to be a post? a get could work. what are the parameters
[16:38:43] <jabagawee> https://github.com/jabagawee/fsmify/blob/master/app/static/main.js#L68
[16:39:37] <jabagawee> page is at http://fsmify.herokuapp.com, and if you need a sufficiently large input
[16:39:39] <jabagawee> try using https://gist.github.com/jabagawee/6144319
[16:42:15] <jabagawee> doug65536: two parameters, but the second parameter can be in the thousands of characters in length
[16:42:49] <doug65536> jabagawee: thousands of characters could work. there is no set limit for a get query afaik
[16:43:33] <doug65536> so it would be <url>?param=whatever&thefsm=<thousands of characters>
[16:43:41] <doug65536> passed through escape
[16:43:52] <jabagawee> doug65536: last time i tried it, it wouldn't work :(
[16:43:55] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily: http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html
[16:44:43] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: that page says numbers like 64K characters, 80000, 190000 etc
[16:44:54] <duch_kazatel> IE is 2,048
[16:45:06] <doug65536> lol, yeah, IE would suck wouldn't it.
[16:45:17] <doug65536> that is still "thousands"
[16:45:30] <duch_kazatel> just saying - it's relevant.
[16:45:31] <jabagawee> the query strings get really long really fast
[16:45:43] <duch_kazatel> why are you making such large querystrings now?
[16:46:08] <doug65536> duch_kazatel: it's a web service that takes a post, draws an FSM diagram and sends you a png of it
[16:46:09] <jabagawee> because the graphviz language + fairly large FSMs
[16:46:15] <jabagawee> is quite verbose
[16:46:24] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[16:46:35] <doug65536> jabagawee: can you point me to the documentation for the API?
[16:47:09] <jabagawee> doug65536: https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/chart_params#gcharts_chof
[16:49:50] <doug65536> jabagawee: it's not pretty but they suggest an iframe https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/post_requests
[16:50:11] <jabagawee> augh
[16:50:11] <doug65536> then the whole 'page' in the iframe becomes the image
[16:50:18] <jabagawee> any other image drawing libraries you suggest?
[16:52:02] <doug65536> jabagawee: for automatically generating FSM diagrams right?
[16:52:07] <jabagawee> yeah
[16:54:51] <doug65536> jabagawee: I don't think the iframe thing wouldn't be that hard to get working
[16:55:01] <jabagawee> yeah i guess not
[16:55:10] <jabagawee> but it's also on a deprecated api
[16:55:14] <jabagawee> that'll die in a year
[16:55:22] <doug65536> iframe?
[16:55:25] <jabagawee> so i might as well make it death-proof
[16:55:29] <jabagawee> oh, the google charts api
[16:55:37] <doug65536> ah
[17:07:49] <doug65536> jabagawee: one possibility that I'm unsure of is using html5 local storage api
[17:35:22] <virgomoon> Evening, all!  I'm working on my first jquery site/mobile app.  How is it typically handled to write a website and a mobile app with many of the same features/data views with size tweaks for the mobile app?  Is there completely separate code for both the desktop and mobile app or is it typically written such that the css/js handles all the presentation details?  Or is that too broad of a question to answer?
[17:36:01] <duch_kazatel> virgomoon it entirely depends on the strategy.
[17:36:30] <duch_kazatel> there's responsive design, which is intended to scale dynamically depending on screen sizes, or serving up completely different sites.
[17:36:52] <duch_kazatel> "typical" is unimportant because it depends on what you need to accomplish.
[17:38:19] <virgomoon> well, that was my thinking as well, duch_kazatel .. being new to jquery and the mobile platform as well, I wasn't finding much online about typical development
[17:38:26] <virgomoon> but, as you say, there's likely no such thing
[17:39:17] <virgomoon> my current thought was to work on the mobile first and try to reuse what I can on the desktop side
[17:39:35] <duch_kazatel> that's one way t do it, but that often leads to lackluster desktop versions :)
[17:39:39] <duch_kazatel> what is your site for?
[17:40:05] <virgomoon> inventory management
[17:40:19] <duch_kazatel> why do you need a mobile version for that?
[17:41:06] <duch_kazatel> because if it's actually important, you'll want to create two seperate frontends for that.
[17:41:08] <virgomoon> warehouse use, folks go 'on the road' to collect stock and like to list from there, general 'staying in touch' while away from a desk, etc
[17:41:50] <virgomoon> agreed .. I played with expanding a mobile-esque front-end to fit/work on the desktop and it was just awful
[17:42:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's not going to work well.  every time i've seen people try to do that it simply doesn't turn out very well.
[17:42:17] <duch_kazatel> you wind up with a lot of compromises on each side.
[17:42:51] <virgomoon> what I've done is make the actual data manipulation an XML back-end and the presentation is just that, so the different front-ends only need to present, not manipulate the data
[17:43:20] <naeluh> where's the party !! its friday!
[17:43:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah, then you're basically setup for two different versions.  i really wouldn't try to repurpose unless time is a major concern at the moment.  do whatever you can to do two distinct versions.
[17:43:47] <duch_kazatel> ain't no party like a jquery party.
[17:43:58] <naeluh> :-)
[17:44:38] <virgomoon> ya, you're likely right .. not only is the form factor different, the user interacts with mobile and desktop completely differently
[17:46:03] <naeluh> virgomoon: there is also the frameworks too
[17:46:25] <virgomoon> what do you mean?
[17:46:28] <naeluh> twitter bootstrap and zurb foundation
[17:46:35] <virgomoon> ok
[17:46:53] <naeluh> http://foundation.zurb.com/
[17:47:14] <naeluh> http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/
[17:47:41] <naeluh> all of them come lots of cool stuff that allows for fast developing
[17:48:21] <naeluh> http://www.initializr.com/
[17:49:17] <duch_kazatel> the problem with those is you wind up with sites that are full of compromises.
[17:49:27] <duch_kazatel> i used bootstrap and was really unimpressed as time went on.
[17:49:55] <naeluh> duch_kazatel: yeah I agree prob then best out of those is initalizer
[17:50:16] <duch_kazatel> For what he's doing it's probably smarter to do a full site imo.
[17:50:18] <LindsayMac> those types of things are PERFECT for rapid prototyping, but you should really develop your own code for final
[17:50:19] <naeluh> there good for building out quick sites though
[17:50:28] <LindsayMac> they're
[17:50:30] <LindsayMac> *
[17:50:33] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac - exactly.
[17:50:50] <naeluh> whoa watch that grammar
[17:50:51] <duch_kazatel> therwise you have a bunch of compromising going on.
[17:51:22] <virgomoon> what I've found for myself (being a bit weak and late to the game as far as JS/(good)CSS goes) is using tools like that does give me great ideas to put into custom production code
[17:51:27] <LindsayMac> sorry.. they're / there is a pet peeve
[17:51:34] <naeluh> haha
[17:51:55] <duch_kazatel> virgomoon - that's always awesome.  do you have a designer you can work with?
[17:52:07] <LindsayMac> yea I recommend partnering with a designer
[17:52:08] <LindsayMac> if you can
[17:52:10] <virgomoon> nope .. just little ole me
[17:52:11] <LindsayMac> then the ideas come
[17:52:14] <duch_kazatel> ouch.
[17:52:25] <duch_kazatel> i'm so happy i work with half decent designers these days
[17:52:28] <virgomoon> eh, I enjoy it, really .. it's a challenge
[17:52:30] <LindsayMac> then you should probably avoid those frameworks only because you are going to NEVER learn to actually design things
[17:52:39] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[17:52:43] <virgomoon> ya
[17:53:17] <virgomoon> I like building the 'ugly tank' to get the data to work correctly and how I want it, then work on making it pretty
[17:53:34] <LindsayMac> no no no...
[17:53:39] <LindsayMac> thats not how you design!
[17:53:44] <LindsayMac> you should wireframe / sketch..
[17:53:51] <LindsayMac> then make a flat mockup in PS and AI
[17:54:07] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[17:54:08] <naeluh> what indesign
[17:54:09] <LindsayMac> THEN you can work on the back end and make it work but ugly and add your design on top of it
[17:54:12] <naeluh> aboiut
[17:54:17] <LindsayMac> huh?
[17:54:23] <naeluh> what about indesign
[17:54:24] <virgomoon> in my experience folks have been happy with 'simple yet clunky-looking' when it comes to the more 'industrial' designs I've worked with
[17:54:31] <duch_kazatel> no indesign.
[17:54:33] <LindsayMac> ugh
[17:54:38] <naeluh> haha
[17:54:47] <LindsayMac> virgomoon: if you want to maintain your mediocrity.. thats your choice
[17:54:59] <naeluh> less is more
[17:55:09] <virgomoon> well, LindsayMac, I'm not .. that's why I'm here
[17:55:16] <duch_kazatel> and LindsayMac - your backend should be that dictated by your frontend.  you should make sure it's future-proofed.
[17:55:23] <LindsayMac> naeluh:  are you just spurting out useless snippets of info>
[17:55:23] <LindsayMac> ?
[17:55:35] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  huh?
[17:55:38] <naeluh> I wouldnt say there useless
[17:55:43] <naeluh> they're
[17:55:46] <LindsayMac> "less is more"
[17:55:49] <naeluh> *
[17:55:57] <LindsayMac> that says a lot of nothing in relation to this convo
[17:56:02] <naeluh> well I feel like that is a good design tip
[17:56:02] <LindsayMac> "what about inDesign"
[17:56:04] <LindsayMac> is bleh
[17:56:11] <LindsayMac> but we aren't talking about design "tips"
[17:56:30] <LindsayMac> but anyways.. virgomoon if you want to actually learn to design< i recommend you learn graphic design. Dont just hack your way at a front end
[17:56:39] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i can't tell if you're agreeing with me or disagreeing..hah
[17:56:46] <naeluh> well I believe you can accomplish a good design using a number of adobe product rather than just using photoshop or Illustrator
[17:56:52] <LindsayMac> lol
[17:57:25] <LindsayMac> inDesign (in my opinion) makes more sense than photoshop
[17:57:41] <LindsayMac> i find photoshop to be the weirdest thing for web design> i do not understand how it landed where it is today in the work flow
[17:57:58] <virgomoon> photoshop for web design?
[17:58:18] <LindsayMac> yes...
[17:58:24] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac - sorry i misread your original design statement.
[17:58:35] <LindsayMac> ok
[17:58:35] <virgomoon> I'll take your word for it, lol
[17:58:38] <naeluh> yeah I mean ps can be good for optimizing images if you dont have a software that already does on the server
[17:58:46] <naeluh> or you can fireworks
[17:58:51] <LindsayMac> I hate fireworks
[17:58:58] <duch_kazatel> and photoshop became popular because you can prototype and have all your image assets ready to go.
[17:59:02] <naeluh> yeah fw6 might be the last one
[17:59:07] <LindsayMac> but photoshop is the standard with illustrator second and inDesign/Fireworks fighting for third probably
[17:59:15] <duch_kazatel> depending on the environment, it's a godsend.
[17:59:15] <virgomoon> I like fireworks .. especially the ones that blast the single ring out from the center
[17:59:18] <virgomoon> those are cool :)
[17:59:25] <LindsayMac> ugh
[17:59:27] <naeluh> true
[17:59:33] <LindsayMac> no one likes an annoying smart ass
[17:59:34] <naeluh> I like those too
[17:59:36] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:59:37] <duch_kazatel> i do.
[17:59:41] <naeluh> haha
[17:59:48] <duch_kazatel> but that's because I'm an annoying smartass too.
[17:59:58] <naeluh> I got some more "tips" coming soon
[18:00:08] <naeluh> :-)
[18:00:08] <virgomoon> "We hate in others that which we hate most about ourselves."
[18:00:36] <LindsayMac> nah.. I have many more things I hate about myself. Thats not one of them
[18:00:47] <naeluh> virgomoon: is that a quote from you or someone else
[18:01:04] <virgomoon> it's my own wording for what I've heard from others, I believe
[18:01:06] <LindsayMac> but anyways, if you want to design.. learn to design. Otherwise find a designe rto partner with because otherwise you will never reach out of mediocrity and clunky sites
[18:01:21] <LindsayMac> ie: he made it up
[18:01:33] <duch_kazatel> eeehhhh.
[18:01:50] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac - that is not at all my experience.
[18:01:59] <naeluh> I heard someone say design mobile first one time
[18:02:10] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  huh?
[18:02:10] <duch_kazatel> i'm a programmer who can't design - that hasn't held back my career at all.
[18:02:16] <virgomoon> alright .. well, duch_kazatel, et al, thank you for all your input.  Seems I was just second-guessing myself.
[18:02:19] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  because you work with designers
[18:02:38] <naeluh> I bet duch_kazatel is a great designer is just pulling our chain
[18:02:44] <naeluh> he's*
[18:02:51] <naeluh> or wait I dont know
[18:03:04] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac - then your generalization doesn't make sense/.
[18:03:24] <LindsayMac> what?
[18:03:31] <duch_kazatel> " but anyways, if you want to design.. learn to design. Otherwise find a designe rto partner with because otherwise you will never reach out of mediocrity and clunky sites"
[18:03:37] <LindsayMac> I said if you don't want to learn to design you should find a designer to partner with
[18:03:43] <duch_kazatel> what's that bit about "reach out of mediocrity"?
[18:03:59] <naeluh> ok later on I gotta party started irl
[18:04:12] <LindsayMac> If you don't either learn to design well OR you partner with a designer.. as a developer your sites will never LOOK good
[18:04:24] <LindsayMac> ie: they will always have the clunky mediocre look ..
[18:04:25] <naeluh> get this party started irl good luck ladies and gentlemen
[18:04:34] <LindsayMac> because 1) you dont know how to design anything and 2) you don't use a designer
[18:04:45] <LindsayMac> ie" a non designer trying to design.. doesn't result in great work
[18:05:26] <duch_kazatel> you're saying the site will never come out of mediocrity, not the person.
[18:05:46] <LindsayMac> I'm saying the WORK will never come out of mediocrity
[18:06:00] <duch_kazatel> so my work will never come out of mediocrity because i can't design?
[18:06:05] <duch_kazatel> that really doesn't make much sense.
[18:06:06] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:06:20] <duch_kazatel> unless you're saying that the output itself (the end result) will not.
[18:06:37] <LindsayMac> No the work product
[18:06:42] <LindsayMac> sorry
[18:06:47] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[18:06:50] <duch_kazatel> that makes more sense.
[18:06:53] <LindsayMac> You will not be able to complete a project ..
[18:07:05] <LindsayMac> that has a major lacking in that area..
[18:07:27] <LindsayMac> omg that made no sense
[18:07:29] <LindsayMac> sprry
[18:07:34] <LindsayMac> brain is spinning right now
[18:07:53] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:08:10] <duch_kazatel> you can get away with shitty design (trust me i've seen it) - it really depends on the audience.
[18:08:11] <LindsayMac> But my point.. if you don't learn design principals well and learn how to use them OR team with a designer.. the work product will always live in the clunky, mediocre realm
[18:08:33] <LindsayMac> well yea.. you can GET AWAY WITH.. but it will live in that purgatory of "its a site.. it's there.. it works.."
[18:08:35] <duch_kazatel> i've used systems that generated millions of revenue that were ugly ugly ugly.
[18:08:36] <LindsayMac> and thats it
[18:08:54] <duch_kazatel> you're talking about general internet-facing stuff, not internal tools meant to get basic things done.
[18:08:59] <virgomoon> I don't know .. my current clunky seems to be well-received and paying the bills multiple times over
[18:09:07] <LindsayMac> yea .. because this guy designs/ builds WEBSITES
[18:09:10] <LindsayMac> (from what I could tell)
[18:09:18] <LindsayMac> lol "well received"
[18:09:26] <duch_kazatel> website does not mean it's facing the general public.
[18:09:26] <LindsayMac> like i said.. you can sit around and live in mediocrity and make money
[18:09:30] <LindsayMac> no one is saying you can't
[18:09:32] <virgomoon> see, duch_kazatel, and that's where the vast majority of the value of what we do is .. data consistency and performance
[18:09:54] <nerder> hello
[18:09:59] <duch_kazatel> i worked a bit on a data entry tool.  it wasn't very pretty, but it was functional as all helll.
[18:10:03] <duch_kazatel> *hell
[18:10:04] <nerder> i can talk about js as well?
[18:10:05] <LindsayMac> then maybe I misunderstood.. but I sttill feel that those clunky pieces of software that are widely used and serve a purpose could be SOO much better if they bring on a solid UX designer
[18:10:24] <LindsayMac> If you don't use UX you do loose some functionality of it
[18:10:41] <virgomoon> that might be true, LindsayMac, but that hardly means they're 'living in mediocrity' just because it doesn't fit your standard of 'pretty'
[18:10:47] <LindsayMac> because the form follows the function in that it helps to guide you to the interactions you are expected to make
[18:10:52] <duch_kazatel> nerder - go to the javascript channel for that.
[18:10:54] <LindsayMac> virgomoon:  no.
[18:10:57] <LindsayMac> not PRETTY
[18:11:04] <nerder> duch_kazatel, thx ;)
[18:11:05] <LindsayMac> if you thinking designing something means making it pretty, tou are wrong
[18:11:09] <LindsayMac> very wrong
[18:11:16] <virgomoon> well, I use 'pretty' as a very broad term
[18:11:18] <LindsayMac> design only enhances function...
[18:11:19] <LindsayMac> no
[18:11:27] <LindsayMac> pretty is superficial
[18:11:28] <LindsayMac> so no
[18:11:28] <duch_kazatel> the problem with many UX designers is they get too attached to *their* design.  in the case i'm talking about, the tool design and experience was actually better dictated by the end user.
[18:11:31] <virgomoon> it includes functionality as well
[18:11:53] <duch_kazatel> again, this was not a tool available to the general internet populace.
[18:11:54] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  sure.. but that is just a UX designer who isn't doing their job by COLLABORATING with their coder
[18:12:01] <LindsayMac> virgomoon:  No..lol
[18:12:09] <duch_kazatel> no, that was a case where a designer had no business being ;)
[18:12:13] <LindsayMac> making something PRETTY is NOT the same thing as DESIGNING something
[18:12:18] <LindsayMac> its just not
[18:12:24] <virgomoon> actually, in the sense I was speaking of, yes
[18:12:31] <duch_kazatel> oh jesus here we go.
[18:12:33] <duch_kazatel> semantics fight.
[18:12:35] <virgomoon> :)
[18:12:36] <LindsayMac> Oh so you made a new definition
[18:12:48] <virgomoon> come on, duch_kazatel, couldn't let your Friday night be boring
[18:12:49] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[18:12:55] <LindsayMac> i'm sorry but defining design as making something "pretty' is a little more than semantics
[18:13:04] <virgomoon> lol
[18:13:11] <duch_kazatel> you're getting all up in a ruffle for no good reason imo.
[18:13:18] <virgomoon> agreed
[18:13:26] <LindsayMac> Its because there is a lack of understanding of what design actually does
[18:13:40] <virgomoon> design is dictated by the need
[18:13:48] <duch_kazatel> sort of.
[18:13:51] <LindsayMac> I believe that any project, forward facing or not, could only benefit in functionality with the touch of an interface designer
[18:13:57] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[18:14:04] <duch_kazatel> that is not 100% true.
[18:14:23] <duch_kazatel> generally?  probably, but not as an absolute - i again point to the tool i mentioned before.
[18:14:38] <LindsayMac> I believe it is.. because while something "works" without one, it could work better with someone who has a solid understanding of HOW people use the system and the design decisions that would make it easier for them to use
[18:14:44] <virgomoon> well, my farm truck could use a touch of an auto detailer, too, but you don't see me spending the money to get one out here
[18:14:54] <LindsayMac> i dont actually KNOW the tool so I can't really say anything one way or the other
[18:14:58] <LindsayMac> you might as well be pointing to air
[18:14:59] <duch_kazatel> exactly ;)
[18:15:06] <LindsayMac> virgomoon:  you're loosing it again
[18:15:12] <duch_kazatel> the tool in question was modified per the requests of the people using it.
[18:15:15] <LindsayMac> auto detailer does not serve a function
[18:15:23] <virgomoon> au contraire, it's already gone
[18:15:26] <duch_kazatel> it's still in use and generates large amounts of money.
[18:15:28] <virgomoon> sure it does
[18:15:34] <LindsayMac> no
[18:15:35] <LindsayMac> it doesnt
[18:15:43] <duch_kazatel> holy wow.
[18:15:48] <virgomoon> ugh
[18:15:49] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: i have already made it clear that badly designed things can make money
[18:15:56] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac - people can disagree.
[18:16:04] <duch_kazatel> stop arguing just because you think you're right.
[18:16:10] <LindsayMac> how does detailing something equate to DESIGNING something ? it doesn't
[18:16:11] <duch_kazatel> you're arguing petty semantics at this poitnt.
[18:16:16] <duch_kazatel> to some people it does.
[18:16:23] <duch_kazatel> in some industries, that's what it is.
[18:16:24] <virgomoon> it's a metaphor
[18:16:26] <LindsayMac> because one is superficial "prettying" and one actually adds function and serves a purpose
[18:16:35] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  no. to no people who understand what design it
[18:16:45] <LindsayMac> virgomoon:  then it's an incorrect methaphor
[18:16:51] <duch_kazatel> holy wtf you're nuts.
[18:16:54] <virgomoon> lol
[18:17:01] <duch_kazatel> seriously just let it go.
[18:17:03] <virgomoon> he's having fun, though, duch_kazatel
[18:17:10] <duch_kazatel> I dobut it.
[18:17:12] <LindsayMac> a better one would be replacing some old fuel guage with a brightly lit, easy to read LED readout
[18:17:14] <duch_kazatel> *doubt it
[18:17:27] <virgomoon> true .. what if I can see the old one just fine, though?
[18:17:33] <LindsayMac> nuts? lol.. Go into the #design channel with designers and have this conversation
[18:17:35] <duch_kazatel> virgo - drop it.
[18:17:40] <virgomoon> and, on that point, I will agree with LindsayMac
[18:17:47] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[18:17:51] <LindsayMac> virgomoon: like i said.. i bunch of fucking times now.. old and clunky can work..
[18:18:01] <LindsayMac> but DESIGNED can be more efficient
[18:18:04] <LindsayMac> and make it "work better"
[18:18:07] <virgomoon> CAN be
[18:18:09] <virgomoon> exactly
[18:18:14] <duch_kazatel> there we co.
[18:18:16] <duch_kazatel> *go
[18:18:16] <LindsayMac> ugh.. wow.
[18:18:16] <duch_kazatel> CAN
[18:18:22] <LindsayMac> So who's playing semantics now
[18:18:28] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:18:30] <virgomoon> I'm looking at my truck right now, though .. and it'd look silly with an LED fuel gauge
[18:18:35] <duch_kazatel> you played that card earlier :)
[18:18:36] <virgomoon> and completely unnecessary
[18:18:38] <duch_kazatel> you invited it yourself.
[18:18:40] <LindsayMac> CAN be more efficient AND it CAN make it work better
[18:18:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:18:49] <duch_kazatel> that's totally valid.
[18:18:53] <LindsayMac> oh fuck.i'm dealing with idiots here
[18:18:57] <duch_kazatel> wat
[18:19:01] <duch_kazatel> ad hominem?
[18:19:02] <duch_kazatel> really?
[18:19:02] <virgomoon> just because you can do something doesn't mean you should
[18:19:04] <LindsayMac> have this conversation with any designers.
[18:19:06] <LindsayMac> go for it
[18:19:10] <duch_kazatel> i have.
[18:19:15] <LindsayMac> sure.
[18:19:18] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:19:21] <tw2113> i just entered the room and you're already insulting me LindsayMac
[18:19:21] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[18:19:33] <tw2113> oh wait, i deserve it :D
[18:19:37] <LindsayMac> :P
[18:19:37] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac why are you attacking people now/
[18:19:43] <LindsayMac> lol
[18:19:52] <LindsayMac> QUICK! JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON duch_kazatel!
[18:19:53] <LindsayMac> lol
[18:19:58] <duch_kazatel> wat
[18:20:01] <virgomoon> holy cow .. I want a new fuel gauge now
[18:20:06] * tw2113 plays Kriss Kross for everyone

[18:20:46] <LindsayMac> https://speakerdeck.com/marktimemedia/stop-making-things-pretty-and-start-designing
[18:20:56] <duch_kazatel> so anyway - how's everybody's friday night going?
[18:21:03] <LindsayMac> http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/

[18:34:52] <secretply> Can anybody help me with this problem? Problem is commented in the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/RMwZC/
[18:37:15] <duch_kazatel> woah your formatting is off.
[18:38:06] <secretply> I took off a lot of code, this is just for testing purposes.
[18:38:15] <TorpedoSkyline> +1 duch_kazatel
[18:38:18] <duch_kazatel> you're missing curly brackets.
[18:38:55] <duch_kazatel> and wtf version of IE is giving you an error?
[18:38:57] <TorpedoSkyline> secretply you're missing curly brackets and doing a lot of unnecessary stuff. You don't need to use .attr() to add styles. use .css();
[18:39:41] <secretply> I'll keep it in mind, thanks.
[18:40:08] <secretply> This is IE 10, compability mode doesn't work better but still not correct.
[18:40:18] <secretply> I mean does work better.
[18:40:42] <secretply> I have to do an overhaul on CSS code for older versions of IE but that's not my main focus right now.
[18:41:32] <secretply> Curly brackets around where?
[18:41:55] <duch_kazatel> you had an if and else statement that ommitted the,./
[18:41:56] <duch_kazatel> *them
[18:41:58] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[18:42:19] <secretply> I'm aware of that, if they're 1 line statements, they don't need braces.
[18:42:25] <dbcclarke> Hey does anyone know anything about jquery jqplotting? I need help with mines.
[18:42:26] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[18:42:33] <duch_kazatel> they do, though.
[18:42:45] <duch_kazatel> never, EVER let javascript decide what you meant.
[18:42:50] <duch_kazatel> always be explicit, never implicit/.
[18:43:18] <duch_kazatel> it's a very forgiving language, but that's not always a good thing.
[18:44:45] <secretply> Nevertheless, it still doesn't work with them.
[18:45:07] <duch_kazatel> fix them anyway ;)_
[18:45:40] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I
[18:45:42] <duch_kazatel> *I'm out.
[18:55:20] <secretply> Hmm interesting...the first loop doesn't even work even though it does on the localhost page I have.
[19:32:11] <IceD^> might be silly question, but....
[19:33:15] <IceD^> I'm issuing $.ajax with method: 'delete'. my server side code handles it and redirects to 'normal' page, jq (or browser?) follow redirect, but still tries to do delete
[19:33:57] <IceD^> "DELETE /url" in requests headers when redirecting
[19:35:37] <shoky> IceD^: what's the problem?
[19:37:20] <IceD^> $.ajax('/url1', method: 'delete') -> issues DELETE on /url1 -> DELETE /url1 sends redirect to /url2 (GET, triplechecked) -> jQ or browser handles redirect and redirects to /url2 but _with_ delete in headers
[19:37:38] <IceD^> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-ajax-and-redirect-since-jquery-1-4-2 - similary like this, but /w redirects
[19:37:43] <shoky> what does (GET, triplechecked)  mean?
[19:37:49] <IceD^> deletes*
[19:38:13] <IceD^> I triple checked I "just" redirect to /url2 (Location: /url2)
[19:38:24] <shoky> anyway a redirect is not supposed to change the http method, is it?
[19:38:33] <IceD^> how so?
[19:38:56] <shoky> i mean.. it should leave a DELETE request as a DELETE.. not change it to a GET, for example
[19:39:00] <shoky> when you redirect
[19:39:30] <IceD^> it's common framework (rails) practice
[19:39:47] <IceD^> when you destroy record, you redirect yourself to index
[19:39:54] <IceD^> let me make gist
[19:40:46] <shoky> i dont know rails or what's common to do there
[19:42:39] <IceD^> it's common practice to redirect somewhere after edit/delete
[19:42:47] <IceD^> for all RESTfull frameworks
[19:46:42] <IceD^> https://gist.github.com/iced/6144918
[19:46:44] <IceD^> here you go
[19:47:06] <IceD^> https://gist.github.com/iced/6144918#file-redirect-request-headers-problem-L1 - problem is here
[19:47:15] <neataroni>  /join django
[19:47:35] <shoky> IceD^: try 303 maybe
[19:47:54] <IceD^> is it normal at all?
[19:49:03] <shoky> sure?
[19:49:32] <IceD^> I'm pretty sure it's bug in jQ
[19:49:59] <shoky> jq doesn't handle redirects
[19:50:05] <shoky> it's the browser
[19:51:09] <ANoKneeMoose> Would anyone happen to know why a jQuery animation used in this fashion -> $(div).show("drop", 1000) would break after an onpopstate event (i.e., hitting the back button and having the HTML5 API/js do the rest)? I'm getting the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Property '1000' of object #<Object> is not a function [
[19:51:48] <ANoKneeMoose> jQuery UI*, more specifically
[19:53:33] <shoky> IceD^: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302  it explains clearly
[19:54:58] <IceD^> just checked - redirects after POST got GETs everywhere
[19:55:09] <IceD^> let me check patch as well ;)
[19:56:17] <shoky> what did you do
[19:57:02] <IceD^> made similar method, but with POST instead of DELETE. got redirected properly
[19:57:43] <IceD^> I really want to look that idiot who `invented` ajax into the eyes
[19:57:45] <shoky> 303 is the correct redirect to use here
[19:57:59] <shoky> should work for both DELETE and POST
[19:58:03] <shoky> unless you're using IE4
[19:58:22] <IceD^> chromium. works for post, doesn't work for delete
[19:58:38] <IceD^> but ty - let me try another browser ;)
[19:58:54] <shoky> 303 doesn't work for delete?
[21:36:55] <Mr_Grim> with $.ajax what is the best way to handle connection timeouts and retrys? let's say i want to attempt 3 retry's
[23:39:16] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm having a problem with the two bind statements on this: https://gist.github.com/bobbobbins/6145470
[23:39:53] <bobbobbins> it was working fine until i made it an ajax call, now it breaks…i tried switching it to on, and attaching it to something outside the ajax, but that didn't work either
