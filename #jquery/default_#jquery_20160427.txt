[02:12:30] <Sangeet> hello people
[04:10:41] <HowardwLo> hi all! if i have two input fields within a div, how do i get the second input field given the first?
[04:10:54] <HowardwLo> ie, if var this = first input

[04:30:12] <hellyeah> decx: hey can i show you my last effort?
[04:32:55] <robertparkerx> Can someone help me with this, http://pastebin.com/JghwDc8z
[04:33:47] <robertparkerx> The SerialArray is set but when I go to submit and fire addto_inventory it doesn't insert into the database at all. I'm not seeing any error reports.
[05:23:19] <jisan> hello
[05:24:06] <jisan> I need help with something
[05:24:12] <jisan> anybody?
[05:25:38] <AllTuna> For things such as animations and basic webpage flare, should I be seperating my jQuery scripts per page, or have one script which checks for the page?
[05:26:03] <robertparkerx> jisan what do you need help with
[05:28:16] <jisan> robertparkerx: please see this navigation http://modaoptometry1.com/ . when you click on a menu item, a top border slides up. I implemented this on my site by adding CSS class with border-top property when clicked. But I can't give the slide up effect.
[05:41:22] <robertparkerx> it appears to be working
[05:41:37] <robertparkerx> jisan, it appears to be working
[05:42:16] <jisan> thanks robertparkerx.
[05:42:45] <robertparkerx> jisan excellent website too!
[05:43:00] <jisan> thanks
[06:12:59] <stereosonic> Hello
[06:13:16] <stereosonic> I am looking to create a server list with jquery, but I am struggling with it
[06:13:47] <neo12> this just returns the target instead of the closest element console.log($( e.target ).closest('.price'));
[06:19:06] <jquery421> Good morning! I put a check on a button to verify if a radio button is clicked. if not, I give an alert, then return. But if I click the button again now action is fired. how should I do?
[06:22:32] <Demonen> stereosonic: Define "server list"? Struggling how?
[06:22:45] <stereosonic> yay a response
[06:22:58] <jquery421> Good morning! I put a check on a "next" button to verify if a radio in the page is selected. if not, I give an alert, then return. But if I click the "next button" again no action is fired. which is the problem?
[06:23:35] <neo12> i'm adding a class on event mouseenter, i'd like to remove that class when mouse is no longer hovering whats the name of that event>
[06:23:37] <stereosonic> Demonen: I am trying to create a server list like this http://goo.gl/s6GOrt where the "variables" are synced with the server
[06:23:37] <neo12> ?
[06:23:39] <Demonen> jquery421: Impossible to know without seeing some code. Make a fiddle or something?
[06:24:05] <jquery421> ok
[06:25:15] <Demonen> neo12: That would be a mouseleave
[06:25:24] <neo12> thks
[06:25:30] <Demonen> The pairs are over/out and enter/leave
[06:26:10] <Demonen> stereosonic: Okay, with you so far. What seems to be the problem?
[06:26:25] <stereosonic> I have no idea where to start to recreate the table
[06:26:52] <stereosonic> ive looked at the ajax calls but its still confusing
[06:27:19] <Demonen> Do you have the markup and everything set up, and just need to populate it with data? What is your data source?
[06:27:51] <jquery421> Demonen: I don't know how to do a working fiddle to reproduce the problem :(
[06:28:23] <Demonen> jquery421: Then just put your javascript in there and I'll see if I can spot it.
[06:28:35] <jquery421> http://kopy.io/GbxTg
[06:28:46] <jquery421> this is next button function
[06:29:40] <Demonen> Are you sure animating is set back to false?
[06:29:52] <jquery421> mmm
[06:30:08] <Demonen> What does "mmm", mean? I can't hear your tone of voice in text.
[06:30:33] <jquery421> maybe no
[06:31:27] <jquery421> I can try to add before the return
[06:31:46] <nicolasthery> hi there
[06:32:12] <Demonen> Just comment out line 6 to test the theory.  Sure, it might mess with your animation, or whatever, but at least you'll know where the problem is.
[06:32:15] <Demonen> Hello nicolasthery
[06:32:42] <nicolasthery> I just posted an issue on #jqueryui-dev
[06:32:56] <nicolasthery> Was it the right place or do I post it again here ?
[06:33:23] <nicolasthery> I want some help or a confirmation that this is a bug
[06:34:06] <Demonen> I have no idea what you posted in #jqueryui-dev, but generally speaking, crossposting tends to piss of people that are in both channels.  Wait for a response there?
[06:34:29] <nicolasthery> Well as there is no one in the other chan I'd like to as you here :(
[06:34:56] <nicolasthery> I know that I get pissed of where I get double questions ...
[06:35:30] <nicolasthery> I will not copy paste.... I have a CPU leak in jqueryui tooltip
[06:35:45] <nicolasthery> a setInterval that is never stopped
[06:36:20] <nicolasthery> I know the exact line where it happens
[06:36:30] <nicolasthery> I mean in jqueryui.js
[06:37:01] <Demonen> Sounds like an issue for #jqueryui-dev
[06:37:01] <jquery421> Demonen: without that line it works but twice I see the alert...
[06:37:56] <nicolasthery> Demonen: Is there here any help on jquery-ui tooltip configuration ?
[06:38:24] <Demonen> jquery421: Well, then you know roughly where the problem is.  Happy hunting.  I'm not going to debug your script for you, but if you make progress on your own I might assist.
[06:38:54] <Demonen> nicolasthery: I'm sure there is, but not from me. You do *not* want my help on jquery-ui, as I've used it exactly once.
[06:39:09] <nicolasthery> hihi okee
[06:39:22] <jquery421> Demonen: ok thanks, meanwhile I added an animating = false before return, now I have to find why I see twice the alert
[06:39:47] <nicolasthery> Ok I'll wait for an answer on jqueryui-dev channel
[06:40:11] <Demonen> jquery421: Add breakpoints. Step through the code.
[06:40:25] <jquery421> Demonen: ;)
[06:41:38] <nicolasthery> Anyway, if someone here wants specific details on this CPU leak that I found inside Tooltip Plugin of Jquery-UI.js, (line with comment #8644), just ask me here
[06:42:22] <neo12> i'm mouseenter/mouseleave events to add and remove a close, but it seems inconstant, sometimes it adds the class without removing on mouseleave....
[06:42:28] <neo12> using*
[06:42:35] <neo12> class*
[06:42:43] <Demonen> neo12: Fiddle?
[06:44:30] <nicolasthery> neo12: pay attention on events overlap, some times you get multiple calls and the order isn't consistant
[06:45:10] <nicolasthery> neo12: you should add console logging to understand events calls and their execution *order*
[06:45:46] <neo12> nicolasthery: right. how do i avoid event overlap?
[06:45:48] <nicolasthery> neo12: After that, you should maybe use flags variables to prevent bad calls
[06:45:56] <neo12> i see
[06:46:05] <nicolasthery> ;)
[06:52:05] <neo12> maybe the find() is causing some delay, is there a better way to do this? http://pastebin.com/uMZyypUN
[06:53:40] <nicolasthery> no its fine
[06:54:27] <nicolasthery> actually, if your code is that simple
[06:54:35] <nicolasthery> you should use css :hover
[06:54:52] <neo12> cool :)
[06:55:34] <nicolasthery> #watchlistItem:hover { <Here CSS of your .js-price-color class> }
[06:59:26] <neo12> nicolasthery: event is the list element, and the class is inserted in one of the child elements, would that still work?
[06:59:32] <neo12> on the*
[07:00:39] <nicolasthery> #watchlistItem:hover .price-color-change { <Here CSS of your .js-price-color class> }
[07:01:04] <nicolasthery> space is css mean child elements
[07:01:26] <nicolasthery> Btw this is not really jquery support ;)
[07:03:41] <neo12> nicolasthery: that works like a charm!
[07:09:38] <jquery421> Demonen: I tried adding an event.stopPropagation(); but no luck :(
[07:13:32] <jquery421> Demonen: with this one works! event.stopImmediatePropagation()!! :) But I didn't really understand why
[07:14:05] <Demonen> Suggestion:  Read the documentation for both.
[07:14:25] <nicolasthery> jquery421: returning false is not the same as one of them ?
[07:14:44] <jquery421> probably no
[07:14:59] <nicolasthery> (i mean isn't it the same)
[07:15:07] <Demonen> No.
[07:15:20] <Demonen> The event will still propagate even if it was stopped at that level.
[07:15:23] <jquery421> in the debug after the return false, the jquery init is running again
[07:15:46] <nicolasthery> ok
[07:15:54] <jquery421> I don't know why the framework does this
[07:16:34] <Demonen> "the init"?
[07:16:48] <Demonen> Is your code live on the wild web somewhere?
[07:17:08] <nicolasthery> lol at "wild web"
[07:17:16] <jquery421> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[07:17:32] <jquery421> second page
[07:17:41] <nicolasthery> panzanni !
[07:17:42] <jquery421> click on "scegli il livello"
[07:17:42] <nicolasthery> :p
[07:18:23] <jquery421> never heard that pasta brand!
[07:19:56] <Demonen> "You are not authorized to access this page", then nothing.
[07:20:12] <Demonen> I get a spinner on a white background, and that's it.
[07:20:28] <jquery421> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/
[07:20:36] <jquery421> log as test/test
[07:21:30] <Demonen> Hahaha, my password keeper is giving me HUGE RED WARNINGS about "simple passwords"
[07:21:43] <taplar> y not move the animating = true *right* before you start animating...
[07:22:48] <Demonen> "You are not authorized to access this page." still.
[07:23:09] <jquery421> :O
[07:23:29] <Demonen> I thought "No matter, whatever, I'll just look at the source."
[07:23:36] <Demonen> I did, and now I've closed the tab.
[07:23:57] <jquery421> well is still in develop, sorry
[07:24:11] <nicolasthery> gotta go ... see ya
[07:24:25] <Demonen> I wouldn't even know what .js to begin looking at.
[07:24:27] <nicolasthery> hope someone arrives on the Jqueryui-dev
[07:24:31] <Demonen> Holy macron what a mess.
[07:26:05] <jquery421> macron?
[07:26:09] <Demonen> Either isolate the problem in a jsfiddle.net post, or explain in much greater detail what is going on.
[07:26:28] <Demonen> Because there is no way I'm dipping my toes in that pool of poop.
[07:26:37] <jquery421> I'm trying to grant access of the colorbox page, non prob here
[07:26:46] <jquery421> yes sure man, I totally understand
[07:57:16] <lemonsparrow> hi.. I have a string like "due_date=1462089600&rep_strategy=306" from this I want to assign due date and rep_strategy to variables .. how ?
[07:58:07] <taplar> use split()
[07:59:25] <jquery421> Demonem: permission enabled, it should work now
[08:11:29] <Demonen> jquery421: I don't care, I've lost intrest in even looking at that rat's nest of code. Like I said, jsfiddle or explain in detail, I'm not digging through that to figure it out for you.
[08:22:03] <VectorX> i got a div with data-img='url to image' which on hover of the div i set in a img tag to display the image, but as it loads on hover there is a bit of a lag, how can i preload the images into the browser without being visible and make the process a bit more smoother
[08:23:02] <taplar> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/image-preloader/
[08:23:45] <taplar> straight from the googs
[08:24:41] <VectorX> taplar :)
[08:33:39] <VectorX> works nicely
[08:34:19] <VectorX> where does that img get created though
[08:34:36] <decx> no reason to attach that to the $ prototype
[08:34:39] <taplar> looks like it's created as a fragment
[08:35:18] <decx> also worth to have a callback in a preloader
[08:35:34] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6xe4S/
[08:36:41] <VectorX> mine is a simple example, nothing big https://jsfiddle.net/vw5nxmfy/
[08:38:01] <taplar> decx were you the one with the regex that parsed a param string into an object?
[08:38:30] <decx> like i'm gonna regex for something that can be done with 2 splits
[08:39:06] <taplar> swear i saw someone do that.  was interested in how they did it
[08:39:28] <decx> something with match most likely
[09:01:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:01:50] <hellyeah> i will try to disable button instead of trying event.Progonation()
[09:01:56] <hellyeah> that can be cleaner solution
[09:02:10] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i show you my last effort_
[09:02:31] <taplar> go for it
[09:04:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  click title of datepicker and click month or click Year select a year you will go spesific month and year. When you clcik backto current month you will get april 2016 http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/
[09:08:03] <hellyeah> this feature is implemented in jquery in different way and i asked developer about having this feature built in. But they prefer to give feature about traversing years and months with dropdowns so i used datepicker and dialog to sort this out
[09:08:06] <hellyeah> how does it look_?
[09:09:05] <taplar> seems to work
[09:09:37] <hellyeah> yes it worked
[09:09:42] <hellyeah> but do you like it
[09:09:49] <hellyeah> does my code look good?
[09:09:54] <hellyeah> am i cultivated?
[09:10:07] <hellyeah> you are like my teacher, my supporter :)
[09:10:25] <taplar> *shrug* as a user i'd probably just type in the date if it wasn't a recent date
[09:10:46] <taplar> as far as the code i'd have to look at it a bit
[09:11:02] <hellyeah> this is request of my manager
[09:11:16] <taplar> just a quick glace it looks like your doing similar stuff multiple places
[09:11:22] <hellyeah> i think jquery datepicker has totally decent implementation about that
[09:11:31] <MEGAGHZ> such a lib!
[09:11:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  i think you are talking about switch, case
[09:11:54] <taplar> $('.month1').prop('data-month', 0);
[09:11:55] <taplar> use data()
[09:12:05] <hellyeah> note it
[09:12:19] <hellyeah> taplar:  in each  case one line is different
[09:12:21] <taplar> cache and reuse selectors
[09:12:25] <hellyeah> i will use data()
[09:12:32] <taplar> so that could be generalized in a function probabaly
[09:12:42] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i cache selector as global variable_
[09:13:09] <hellyeah> or global variable is bad
[09:13:24] <taplar> scope it to your namespace
[09:13:26] <taplar> at most
[09:13:35] <hellyeah> what do you mean "generalized in a function"
[09:13:49] <hellyeah> taplar:  i dont know how to use namespace actually
[09:13:54] <hellyeah> i need to look for it
[09:14:10] <taplar> an IIFE or a jQuery closure is a namespace
[09:14:25] <taplar> or those are typically what people refer to
[09:15:14] <taplar> know what those are?
[09:15:27] <hellyeah> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[09:15:29] <hellyeah> ?
[09:15:47] <taplar> yeah
[09:15:56] <taplar> (function(){}( ... ));
[09:15:58] <hellyeah> okey
[09:16:03] <hellyeah> i will lok for it
[09:16:04] <taplar> crap
[09:16:10] <taplar> (function(){ ... }());
[09:16:10] <hellyeah> crap?
[09:16:18] <taplar> had the dots in the wrong place, :)
[09:16:26] <hellyeah> ehehehe
[09:16:42] <taplar> of a jquery closure is just your typical $(function(){ .. });
[09:16:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  it stands like anynomous function on the top
[09:16:50] <hellyeah> is that correct?
[09:16:53] <taplar> it is an anonymous function
[09:17:01] <taplar> but you execute it immediately
[09:17:49] <taplar> it's sole purpose is to allow you to scope all your variables down to it, so they are not global.  and since it works as a namespace it also helps prevent naming collisions
[09:18:09] <hellyeah> $(function(){ func1(); func2(); var func1 = function(){} func2 = function(){ });
[09:18:41] <hellyeah> $(function(){ func1(); func2(); var func1 = function(){} func2 = function(){ } });
[09:19:00] <taplar> it's the same as a doc ready.  just shorthand
[09:19:03] <hellyeah> i understand
[09:19:09] <hellyeah> yeah i know
[09:19:13] <hellyeah> okey
[09:19:19] <hellyeah> it is all about scoping i guess
[09:19:29] <hellyeah> i learnt smt about scope and hoisting
[09:19:55] <taplar> and as far as the generalized functions, if your doing the same thing in multiple places, except for a few things, that can be generalized
[09:20:00] <taplar> you just pass in what is different
[09:20:29] <hellyeah> ah
[09:20:36] <hellyeah> ic now
[09:20:43] <hellyeah> in the case statement i have same lines
[09:20:51] <taplar> btw, your also doing "new Date()" in side some each loops
[09:20:57] <taplar> you really should do that once and reuse it
[09:21:03] <hellyeah> i can write those line once and just write different line in case statement
[09:21:07] <taplar> getting the date is kinda heavy, iirc
[09:21:17] <hellyeah> understand
[09:21:20] <hellyeah> data and date
[09:22:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  did you like the idea?
[09:22:13] <hellyeah> or it seems "bad" idea
[09:22:18] <taplar> what idea?
[09:22:45] <hellyeah> clicking title to get monthsList and yearsList respectively
[09:23:00] <hellyeah> and going spesific month and year by clickin box inside dialog
[09:23:23] <taplar> it's not a bad idea I wouldn't say
[09:23:42] <taplar> though it might need some sort of indicator that that is possible
[09:23:56] <taplar> otherwise i'd have never thought to click the header other than the arrows
[09:24:29] <hellyeah> indicator
[09:24:32] <hellyeah> like what?
[09:24:37] <taplar> *shrug*
[09:24:47] <hellyeah> like an arrow
[09:24:55] <hellyeah> that indicate title
[09:25:04] <hellyeah> -> date <-
[09:25:15] <hellyeah> -> Years <-
[09:25:17] <taplar> in the least change your mouse cursor to be a finger
[09:25:21] <taplar> on hover
[09:25:27] <hellyeah> yes
[09:25:32] <hellyeah> cursor:pointer
[09:25:50] <taplar> and actually you could make it do like the arrows do
[09:26:00] <taplar> see how when you hover over them their background changes?
[09:26:25] <hellyeah> ah
[09:26:27] <taplar> and there is also hover text
[09:26:30] <hellyeah> i forgot adding those
[09:26:37] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:26:57] <hellyeah> those are cursor:pointer
[09:27:05] <hellyeah> hover text like tooltip
[09:28:31] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/x1j739pt/18/
[09:28:36] <hellyeah> content: ".." didnt work
[09:28:55] <hellyeah> anyway this is css question
[09:29:43] <hellyeah> i will focus on the points you meantioned
[09:37:00] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/x1j739pt/19/
[09:42:01] <taplar> i'm not event seeing differences in the bottom switch
[10:00:06] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you prefer disable element or using event.StopProgonation() ?
[10:03:49] <hellyeah> taplar:  when you click Years click event is triggered
[10:04:08] <hellyeah> taplar:  i bind an event to ui-dialog-title
[10:04:24] <hellyeah> taplar:  i dont want any event on Years
[10:04:37] <hellyeah> but not sure how can i avoid this event triggerr
[10:18:28] <taplar> don't do the delegate binding
[10:18:47] <taplar> *then.  bind on the dialog that your concerned about (months)
[10:23:51] <jquery595> &("#myDropdownList").val(myValue).attr("selected", "selected") doesn't change UI
[10:24:09] <jquery595> nor $("#myDropdownList").val(myValue).change()
[10:24:15] <taplar> val() returns the value, not a jquery object
[10:24:25] <taplar> unless you use it as it's setter version
[10:25:13] <taplar> or i may be blonde
[10:25:25] <jquery595> I was gogling for "jquery set value of dropwdown"
[10:25:41] <taplar> ok, i'm blonde
[10:25:50] <jquery595> auhauahuhauha
[10:26:13] <taplar> $("#myDropdownList").val(myValue).prop("selected", true)
[10:26:34] <taplar> or wait, this is a select?
[10:26:50] <jquery595> dropdown is not the same of select?
[10:27:10] <taplar> i'm asking.  are you using <select> ?
[10:27:19] <jquery595> one sec
[10:27:21] <taplar> input type="select"
[10:27:29] <taplar> bah, no just <select>
[10:27:40] <jquery595> yes
[10:27:45] <jquery595> just <select>
[10:28:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/p1mx781a/
[10:29:23] <jquery595> uff, mine doesn't work lke that
[10:30:39] <taplar> are you trying to set it as the text of the option?
[10:31:15] <jquery595> as var I have the optoin value
[10:31:36] <taplar> your variable contains the value that is in one of the options value=""
[10:31:39] <jquery595> so I want to set it by its option value
[10:31:48] <taplar> yeah, so that's what that is doing
[10:31:48] <jquery595> exactly
[10:31:54] <taplar> just without a variable
[10:32:09] <jquery595> I'm doing it on console
[10:32:21] <jquery595> I found that chaining a .change() to val()
[10:32:43] <jquery595> the field related to that option change
[10:32:52] <jquery595> but the dropdown UI still no
[10:33:08] <taplar> so your using something like jquery ui dropdown?
[10:34:07] <jquery595> no, the select comes from cms
[10:34:17] <jquery595> I'm adding JS to that page
[10:34:33] <jquery595> http://181.224.135.163/~tommasom/node/add/rapporto-di-lavoro
[10:34:36] <jquery595> same second page
[10:35:09] <jquery595> the dropdown is the one called "livello"
[10:35:38] <taplar> don't see that one
[10:35:54] <taplar> got it
[10:36:15] <jquery595> jQuery(liv).val(93).change();
[10:36:22] <jquery595> this makes something
[10:36:34] <jquery595> but still dropdown is set to "none"
[10:37:26] <jquery595> found this "Using .trigger("chosen:updated");" on stackoverflow
[10:37:29] <taplar> jQuery('#edit-field-livello-und').val(255).change(); works for me
[10:38:07] <jquery595> grrr
[10:38:20] <jquery595> liv = #edit-field-livello-und
[10:38:37] <jquery595> so why browser makes me sick?
[10:39:06] <jquery595> ops... var liv = "#edit-field-livello-und option:selected";
[10:39:09] <jquery595> my fault
[10:39:13] <jquery595> :(
[10:39:34] <taplar> the code only does what you tell it to do.  it's always our fault, :P
[10:39:44] <jquery595> unfortunately!
[10:40:04] <jquery595> anyway thanks a lot, one more brain is always helpful
[10:40:23] <jquery595> even if up your brain you're blonde :D
[10:40:28] <taplar> unless one is running low on coffee (is currently remedying the issue)
[10:40:46] <jquery595> just took it, lack of experience
[10:42:55] <jquery595> last thing, could you click on "Scegli il livello" and say me if you have authorization problems in the colorbox?
[10:45:10] <taplar> where?
[10:46:01] <taplar> yeah, unauthorized
[10:47:05] <MEGAGHZ> https://jsfiddle.net/xkrykpv5/
[10:47:20] <MEGAGHZ> I need to figure out why my animation stops only once
[10:47:46] <MEGAGHZ> and why is faster every time i click the btn
[10:48:08] <taplar> doesn't look like your storing the next interval
[10:48:51] <MEGAGHZ> explain more pls?
[10:49:33] <taplar> also after the first click of play both the play and stop will happen each time you click the button
[10:49:49] <taplar> removing the class does not remove the bindings
[10:49:58] <taplar> lookups are only for finding the elements to bind on
[10:50:01] <taplar> unless your doing a delegate
[10:50:26] <MEGAGHZ>  mmm
[10:51:34] <MEGAGHZ> so this is not the way to do this
[10:52:03] <AdamPDotty> delegates are what Trump has
[10:52:13] <MEGAGHZ> lol
[10:56:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xkrykpv5/1/
[10:57:11] <jquery595> taplar: thanks
[10:58:16] <MEGAGHZ> taplar: thanks buddy
[10:58:23] <taplar> sure
[10:58:29] <MEGAGHZ> I'll study this
[10:58:46] <taplar> let me know if you have any questions about it
[11:08:07] <MEGAGHZ> taplar: why you using settimeout instead of interval? since the animation might run forever until click
[11:08:33] <taplar> it's habit to avoid interval to avoid possible endless loops
[11:08:50] <taplar> and i don't have to clear it manually
[11:08:53] <taplar> i just let it die
[11:09:05] <MEGAGHZ> ok
[11:09:25] <taplar> heh, which in that case it could probably be made a little smaller
[11:10:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xkrykpv5/2/ :)
[11:15:41] <MEGAGHZ> nice, didnt know what .is
[11:18:14] <Jagst3r15> I have a list spitting out with the class of either true or false, and inside the list there is some text and a hidden video...on click of the true one I want the video to shhow, but when I click on it now all of the videos show...any idea? http://pastebin.com/VDMsxDBj
[11:18:26] <Jagst3r15> I assume my issue is on line 3
[11:24:03] <Jagst3r15> anyone?
[11:29:20] <shoky> Jagst3r15 you probably want something like $(this).find('.question-video-wrap').show()   depending on where exactly that element is in the DOM relative to clicked one
[11:29:21] <AdamPDotty> jQuery(this).find('.question-video-wrap').show();
[11:29:53] <Jagst3r15> ok let me try
[11:29:59] <AdamPDotty> seems, it takes 5 minutes to answer this :-)
[11:30:15] <shoky> more likely you want something like $(this).closest('.question-list').find('.question-video-wrap')   if it's not inside the clicked <li>
[11:31:15] <AdamPDotty> If it got more complicated you would use data-target or something.
[11:31:25] <Jagst3r15> jQuery(this).find('.question-video-wrap').show(); works (:
[11:31:32] <Jagst3r15> I see what I was doing wrong, thank you
[12:11:23] <Jagst3r15> if you have ul li ul li how would you go to the top level li?
[12:11:46] <Jagst3r15> if you are at an element within the second ul li .test for example
[12:11:55] <Jagst3r15> something like? jQuery(this).closest('li').closest('li').removeClass('active-slide');
[12:12:09] <Jagst3r15> where active-slide is the class on the first ul li.active-slide
[12:12:17] <taplar> classes on the uls would be awesome for helping that, :)
[12:13:23] <taplar> $(this).closest('.active-slide')
[12:42:15] <chrispg21> is there a trick to initializing js or jquery that comes in with a late loading html file?
[12:44:07] <robertmaxrees> it just runs, but you should avoid including js in files like that in the first place.
[12:45:02] <chrispg21> in the future id like to avoid it but for now im trying to fix someone elses stuff
[12:45:43] <taplar_lunch> such is life
[12:45:50] <chrispg21> im trying to add an on keyup event handler to a button that gets called via ajax with the script tags
[12:46:12] <chrispg21> with its own script tags
[12:46:28] <robertmaxrees> you should actually use event delegation for that.
[12:46:38] <chrispg21> i thought js had to be loaded with page
[12:46:46] <chrispg21> ah that sounds like the right track thanks
[12:47:42] * taplar_lunch feels like making "but for now im trying to fix someone elses stuff " his email status
[12:48:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:50:49] <taplar_lunch> or maybe "today I feel like 1/0"
[12:52:00] <taplar_lunch> hah.
[12:52:27] <taplar_lunch> "Hey baby, you look so good your divisible by zero!"  "What?"  "Unquantafiable!"
[12:52:33] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:53:15] <taplar_lunch> someone, some where, has to have used that one
[12:54:51] <taplar_lunch> "I swear officer, she said she was 13.  And I thought she was talking hexadecimal..."
[13:11:39] <taplar_lunch> boom: http://i.imgur.com/H0Wm6fk.jpg
[13:12:41] <Uhkis> you're*
[13:13:01] * taplar_lunch will never be good enough
[13:50:13] <tharkun> I'm looking for a table pluggin to sort a table like I recently saw on wikipedia. Does wikipedia use jquery? Is there something that does the job? What is my fine grained search term?
[13:50:40] <robertmaxrees> jquery sort table rows
[13:50:46] <robertmaxrees> lots of solutions out there.
[13:56:28] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: Thanks google has been a jerk all day. :)
[14:06:20] <berto> hello,
[14:06:30] <berto> what is the regex to check that a input start with a + and is only followed by number ? thanks
[14:07:19] <taplar> ... /^\+0-9/ maybe?
[14:07:22] <robertmaxrees> something like \+\d+
[14:10:34] <taplar> assuming your concerned with only integers
[14:11:14] <berto> taplar: yes basically I want to check that's international format phone number ( like +123456788999)
[14:11:23] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[14:11:29] <robertmaxrees> search google for phone number validators then.
[14:11:30] <berto> I tried /^\+0-9/
[14:12:03] <taplar> try roberts, mine only looks for a single following number
[14:12:34] <berto> yes it does not work too :D
[14:12:55] <berto> curiously, it accept a letter
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:13:18] <berto> \d should be only number no ?
[14:13:52] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "it accept a letter"?
[14:14:03] <berto> taplar: I can not do then ^\+0-9{0,20} ?
[14:14:03] <NoiseEee> berto: regex101.com goes a long way
[14:14:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:14:40] <berto> robertmaxrees: I wrote +12345abc and it return true.
[14:14:41] <berto> :D
[14:14:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qhgr13d2/ seems to work
[14:14:48] <berto> NoiseEee: thanks
[14:15:01] <berto> ha the +$
[14:15:07] <berto> meaning till the end no ?
[14:15:15] <taplar> $ = eol
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> err, right.  because \+\d+ is + followed by one or more numbers.  which yours meets.
[14:16:12] <berto> yes ! :D
[14:16:15] <berto> thanks guys :D
[14:16:42] <berto>  /^\+\d+$/ did the trick.
[14:17:23] <taplar> i'm assuming you only ever want 12 numbers?
[14:17:50] <berto> no it's fine.
[14:17:59] <taplar> ho'kay
[14:18:04] <berto> I mean it's for internal purpose we dont expect fake number :D
[14:18:10] <berto> just checking the format.
[14:18:30] <taplar> so +123 is valid
[14:18:43] <berto> I put 6 minimum
[14:19:07] <Uhkis> "fake number" might not be intentional
[14:19:33] <arc_> ya, validators are for mistakes as much as they are for malicious input
[14:20:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:20:11] <berto> I'm using an api to send SMS. I can check that the phone number is active.
[14:20:17] <robertmaxrees> validating international phone numbers is tricky business.
[14:20:32] <berto> I plan to add this check later on, just finishing my form first :D
[14:20:57] <robertmaxrees> lol i'll never understand that logic.
[14:21:26] <berto> which one ?
[14:24:16] <decx> easy phone input http://i.imgur.com/D1XLsLB.jpg
[14:25:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:25:52] <decx> also started my own https://jsfiddle.net/decx/mw2szcc7/
[14:26:40] <berto> stupid question, when I do ajax call, can I return on server side more that one "echo json_encode()" by ajax call ? or this would only work using node.js for example ?
[14:26:55] <robertmaxrees> berto you can return anything you want.
[14:27:01] <arc_> wow that's a lot of work for a joke :p
[14:27:19] <decx> never went anywhere tho
[14:28:15] <decx> how long could it take to draw a few circles
[14:29:17] <taplar> i wouldn't think you'd want to do more than one echo of json
[14:29:35] <decx> you just stack them
[14:29:50] <decx> [json1, json2]
[14:30:06] <taplar> yeah, collect all of it and echo at the end
[14:30:57] <berto> taplar: I want to do some kind of step creator. Like when you submit the form it returns : step one is finish, step two is finish, step three is finsh..
[14:31:18] <berto> beside making one ajax call by step..
[14:31:26] <berto> that's why I ask.
[14:31:55] <taplar> { step1: { finished: true }, step2: { finished: false } }
[14:32:00] <taplar> or whatevs
[14:32:14] <berto> taplar: yes but it will be return one atonce.
[14:32:31] <taplar> so it only returns info about the step inquired on?
[14:32:55] <berto> that's the thing I would like to be notify step by step.
[14:33:14] <taplar> are you talking about pushing out notifications?
[14:33:35] <berto> no, to push you need websocket or something like this.
[14:33:41] <taplar> right...
[14:34:34] <berto> so I need one ajax call by step then..
[14:34:49] <taplar> one call per step?
[14:35:54] <berto> I can not do one ajax call with all the information and do a echo json_decode(step1 : true); then echo json_decode(step2 : true); and to finish echo json_decode(step3 : true);
[14:36:11] <robertmaxrees> then combine all three into one object.
[14:36:14] <taplar> ^
[14:36:25] <berto> robertmaxrees: I dont want that :D
[14:36:25] <taplar> cause parsing {}{}{} will be a bitch
[14:36:32] <berto> then it's not notification then :D
[14:36:36] <taplar> well, less than plesant
[14:36:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:36:44] <robertmaxrees> "it's not notification"?
[14:36:51] <robertmaxrees> you mena you want to validate each field?
[14:37:11] <taplar> it sounds like your expecting this request to just hang around open until the third thing finishes
[14:37:22] <berto> taplar: yes.
[14:37:26] <taplar> -_-
[14:37:28] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.
[14:37:33] <berto> websocket then .. :D
[14:37:37] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:37:40] <berto> damn..
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> just validate each field when it loses focus.
[14:37:57] <robertmaxrees> or validate when the user submits and do it all in one go.
[14:38:03] <berto> robertmaxrees: no it's not about the form anymore :D
[14:38:10] <berto> it's more on server side now. D
[14:38:18] <berto> all the info are send to create multiple accounts.
[14:38:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:09] <berto> I wanted to return a OK | KO between each creation of accounts.
[14:39:27] <taplar> it's a single request though.  there is only one return
[14:39:33] <berto> yep
[14:39:42] <robertmaxrees> and that return can have data for each account.
[14:39:53] <berto> I will just to a ajax call for each step.
[14:40:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:40:16] <berto> account creation ..
[14:40:50] <taplar> you could always tell the requestor how to check if the thing is done, if you don't want to do websockets
[14:41:05] <berto> taplar: I will implement it later.
[14:41:11] <berto> v1 .. :D
[14:41:25] <berto> next year :P
[14:41:47] <taplar> what is the hesitancy of combining the results?
[14:41:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:42:00] <berto> taplar: it's more fancy :D
[14:42:04] <berto> that's the only purpose .
[14:42:08] <taplar> ?
[14:42:20] <berto> I dont care I use CURL do do my querys again this website :D
[14:42:25] <robertmaxrees> by "fancy" do you mean "more difficult"?
[14:42:31] <berto> maybe.
[14:42:32] <taplar> "more confusing"
[14:43:08] <taplar> i usually hear 'fancy' when i try some off the wall stuff and my team members see it...
[14:43:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[14:43:25] <taplar> "Don't be fancy"  "But it works!"  "No Mark.."
[14:44:12] <berto> well this script manage the creation of 4 different accounts, managing the "add" in members groups in some LDAP or web apps, I would rather prefer to be inform where it fails instead of having a spinner turnning for 1 minutes without knowing what it's going on.
[14:45:18] <berto> robertmaxrees: that's why I was using "notification". it's more about having a live state of the operation in the backend.
[15:08:45] <Yatekii> guys I do $.get().fail() and inside fail I print the data object. and it tells me the status code is 200 and the data is the one expected. how can it fail with status 200???
[15:08:52] <Yatekii> I also do not get an error message :S
[15:09:51] <taplar> are you expecting a json response and not returning a (valid) json response?
[15:10:32] <Yatekii> status text says OK
[15:10:40] <taplar> that's not the data
[15:10:45] <Yatekii> yes I am expecting one bit I didn't advise it to parse it yet
[15:10:53] <Yatekii> I just do a normal get request for now
[15:11:13] <taplar> show your call in a fiddle or something if you would
[15:11:56] <Yatekii> ok it seems like it detects the json from the filename
[15:12:02] <Yatekii> and tries to parse it
[15:12:03] <Yatekii> kek
[15:12:18] <Yatekii> and the json is broken apparently even tho I don't see what it is
[15:12:57] <taplar> https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
[15:15:11] <Yatekii> oh my ... keys have to be strings too ofc
[15:15:12] <Yatekii> dang
[15:15:13] <Yatekii> ty
[15:18:03] <Jagst3r15> if you look at lines 11-13 here what am I doing wrong?
[15:18:13] <Jagst3r15> nvm
[15:18:31] <Jagst3r15> actually here it is: http://pastebin.com/LS4r05hF
[15:18:44] <Jagst3r15> I have var last = activeIndex.eq(-1);
[15:18:49] <jquery549> how should I write this? jQuery(".next")[1].parent()
[15:19:17] <Jagst3r15> essentially when the last quesiton is true i want to console.log "this is the end" when it has no other case-slide elements to go to
[15:19:19] <Jagst3r15> any ideas?
[15:20:17] <taplar> jquery549: .eq(1).parent()
[15:20:42] <jquery549> eq! great!
[15:21:16] <jquery549> thanks a lot!
[15:21:19] <taplar> Jagst3r15: try last()
[15:21:39] <jquery549> why last()?
[15:21:52] <taplar> nvm, -x for eq is valid
[15:23:42] <taplar> oh!
[15:23:53] <taplar> your compairing an index against an element
[15:23:55] <taplar> different types
[15:24:24] <taplar> this === last.get()
[15:24:39] <jquery549> ok but I have 16 elements
[15:24:49] <jquery549> and now I need the second one?
[15:24:56] <taplar> did you name change from Jagst3r15 or sometyhing?
[15:25:09] <jquery549> mine?
[15:25:20] <taplar> yeah, i'm referring to his/her issue
[15:25:35] <jquery549> no I'm the same Italian of today
[15:27:09] <taplar> wait, that doesn't even make sense
[15:27:29] <jquery549> well I don't know how many italian asking here
[15:27:38] <taplar> activeIndex is a number and your trying to get the 'last' from it
[15:38:40] <Jagst3r15> taplar I need to use: this === last.get()
[15:38:42] <Jagst3r15> right?
[15:39:04] <taplar> you got problems on ln 7 and 8
[15:39:14] <taplar> what are you trying to do there?
[15:40:01] <Jagst3r15> taplar var activeIndex = jQuery(this).closest('.active-slide').index(); is to go to the next one
[15:40:14] <taplar> that gets you the index of the current one
[15:40:31] <taplar> which is a number
[15:41:19] <Jagst3r15> yes
[15:41:29] <Jagst3r15> then you'll see jQuery(jQuery('.case-slide').get(activeIndex + 1)).addClass('active-slide');
[15:41:48] <taplar> what about line 8?
[15:42:10] <Jagst3r15> that is garbage I think
[15:42:14] <taplar> yup
[15:42:17] <Jagst3r15> I was trying to flag the last one
[15:42:51] <Jagst3r15> do I need: if (this === last.get(- 1)) {
[15:43:32] <taplar> you could just check if next().length < 1 i would think
[15:44:18] <taplar> next() gets you the next following sibling.  if it doesn't return any element, then logically it's the last one
[15:44:55] <Jagst3r15> so....: if (next().length < 1) { ?
[15:45:08] <Jagst3r15> or this === if (next().length < 1) {
[15:45:11] <Jagst3r15> crap
[15:45:23] <Jagst3r15> if (this === next().length < 1) {
[15:45:44] <taplar> your pretty hung up on === :s
[15:47:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/tLhsy76t/
[15:47:48] <Jagst3r15> woo
[15:47:49] <Jagst3r15> I got it
[15:48:12] <Jagst3r15> that is pretty much what I did too (:
[15:49:17] <taplar> btw, two small things.  you should consider using an IIFE or jquery closure so you can pass in $ and use it for your logic.  and also you should cache $(this) if you do it a lot, which you are
[15:49:34] <Jagst3r15> ok, I will try to optimize
[15:49:51] <Jagst3r15> can you explain what you mean by cache?
[15:49:59] <Jagst3r15> you mean the browser will cache that
[15:50:03] <taplar> var $this = $(this);
[15:50:08] <taplar> and reuse $this
[15:50:19] <taplar> jQuery object instantiation is fairly heavy
[15:50:26] <Jagst3r15> ohhh ok
[15:50:49] <taplar> D.R.Y man, :)
[17:41:17] <sdegutis> My google-fu is failing me. How do you check whether a given jQuery object (set of elements) contains a given jQuery object (element)?
[17:42:09] <robertmaxrees> you mean a given element - jquery objects don't contain other jquery objects :)
[17:42:15] <robertmaxrees> i use filter().length ofr stuff like that.
[17:42:34] <sdegutis> I have a given sibling of this, and I'm trying to figure out if it's before or after $(this).
[17:42:50] <sdegutis> I guess .index
[17:43:10] <robertmaxrees> "before"?
[17:43:19] <sdegutis> .before inserts things
[17:43:28] <robertmaxrees> right... what do you mean "before"?
[17:43:34] <robertmaxrees> like, in relation to the element in question.
[17:43:36] <sdegutis> Oh sorry. I mean DOM-positioning.
[17:44:14] <robertmaxrees> you could check indexes against each other i suppose.
[17:44:23] <sdegutis> My other idea was to use this.nextAll() and check if it contains that.
[17:44:32] <sdegutis> Which I'd do with .index I think.
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> what are you building, out of curiosity?
[17:44:41] <sdegutis> this.nextAll().index(that) >= 0
[17:44:55] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: simple 10 line shift-click-to-toggle-multiple-checkboxes thing
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to compare indices then.
[17:46:08] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: why for?
[17:46:19] <robertmaxrees> why do indices matter?
[17:46:44] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: I'm using this[isAfter ? 'nextAll' : 'prevAll'].add(this) to figure out which rows to select.
[17:46:56] <robertmaxrees> are you able to make a simple fiddle?
[17:47:01] <robertmaxrees> because that still doesn't make sense.
[17:50:19] <syed_> HI everyone, I am using jquery cookie plugin for storing cookie and used it in WordPress website but I have some issues:
[17:50:34] <syed_> 1-cookie not expired
[17:50:49] <syed_> 2-code not work in safari browser
[17:50:54] <sdegutis> fricken, how do you add jquery to a fiddle?
[17:51:10] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis see the gear icon next to the "javascript" title in that box?
[17:51:18] <sdegutis> ahh thanks
[17:51:26] <robertmaxrees> click that and then on the "Frameworks & Extensions" dropdown
[17:51:31] <syed_> <script type="text/javascript"> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {   $(":checkbox").on("change", function(e){  		var checkboxValues;  		var CookieSet = $.cookie('checkboxValues');  		if(CookieSet == null){   			checkboxValues = {};   		}else{  			//$.cookie('checkboxValues', null);  			checkboxValues = CookieSet;  		}                  $(":checkbox").each(function(){           checkboxValues[this.value] = this.checked;         });    
[17:51:31] <robertmaxrees> syed_ show us your code.
[17:51:34] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:51:36] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel.
[17:51:41] <sdegutis> https://jsfiddle.net/2gx4rk82/
[17:51:43] <sdegutis> /cc robertmaxrees
[17:51:44] <robertmaxrees> syed_ https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:52:17] <sdegutis> it's probably obvious at this point that JS isnt my day job :/
[17:52:18] <syed_> ok wait let me send u jsfiddle.net link
[17:52:20] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis so what's the story?  what do i do?
[17:52:32] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: you ever use gmail or something where you can shift-click check boxes?
[17:52:41] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: it lets you toggle multiple at once
[17:52:47] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: click one, then shift-click another further away fromit
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> ah - right, get all between the first and last.
[17:53:01] <robertmaxrees> you're overthinking this :)
[17:53:36] <sdegutis> more clear: https://jsfiddle.net/2gx4rk82/1/
[17:53:45] <robertmaxrees> nah i know exactly what you want.
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> this is easy - one sec.
[17:53:51] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: oh no no, i know a much simpler way, i just dont know how to do it in jquery
[17:54:00] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: whats your idea?
[17:54:39] <robertmaxrees> just grab the index of the first clicked one and the index of the last clicked one.  use https://api.jquery.com/slice/ and .prop('checked', true) against that result set.
[17:54:41] <robertmaxrees> done.
[17:54:46] <robertmaxrees> no need to compare indices.
[17:55:00] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: well i will still need to order the indices
[17:55:11] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: but yeah thats simpler
[17:55:12] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis why?
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> what does order have to do with anything?
[17:55:31] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: i dont know if .slice(4,2) works
[17:55:49] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: but yeah thats simpler, thanks
[17:55:52] <robertmaxrees> except you'll never have that case.
[17:56:04] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: however it shouldnt just be true, it should be lastValue
[17:56:07] <robertmaxrees> .map() over the inputs that are checked.
[17:56:26] <robertmaxrees> it should be the same as the current checked box.
[17:56:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:56:30] <syed_> https://jsfiddle.net/ashikra/gy7bfwab/
[17:56:42] <robertmaxrees> syed_ you have a syntax error.
[17:56:43] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: the first one clicked and last one clicked might be in reverse order -- im not following you
[17:56:54] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: if you click the last one, then shift-click the first one, that should still work
[17:57:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the order in which they were clicked has nothing to do with what i'm suggesting.
[17:57:09] <syed_> https://jsfiddle.net/ashikra/gy7bfwab/
[17:57:19] <syed_> updated without syntax error
[17:57:51] <syed_> robertmaxrees: work fine in firefox and chrome but issue in safari
[17:58:13] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: "just grab the index of the first clicked one and the index of the last clicked one. use .slice and .prop('checked', true) against that result set" -- isnt that exactly what youre saying?
[17:58:41] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: i have variables representing "first clicked one" and "last clicked one" (using your terminology here), and i dont know which one is before the other
[17:58:44] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis sure - that has nothing to do with the order things were clicked in.
[17:58:58] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: ....
[17:59:03] <robertmaxrees> aaaah that's right becuase you could shift + click after making other selections.
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> right, makes sense.
[17:59:13] <sdegutis> ok
[17:59:15] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[17:59:20] <sdegutis> had me questioning my sanity for a second
[17:59:33] <robertmaxrees> you COULD, however, just check to see which one is greater than the other and go from there.
[17:59:38] <sdegutis> "does existence really exist? is all of this just in someone's imagination?"
[17:59:51] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: yeah i was just gonna sort the two things and apply it to slice
[18:00:10] <sdegutis> something like .slice.apply([indexA, indexB].sort()) or something
[18:00:17] <sdegutis> (i dont know JS very well)
[18:00:29] <daniel331> hello all. imlooking for an interesting jquery vertical option selector. a bit unusual. I want the selected option to fill up a lot of the page, with unselected options appearing smaller and greyer on top of and below it. very visually appealing. any ideas?
[18:00:32] <robertmaxrees> lol that's overcomplicating it imo.
[18:00:50] <robertmaxrees> daniel331 that's called an accordion.
[18:01:04] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis just call .slice() one way or another explicitly.
[18:01:07] <robertmaxrees> use an if.
[18:01:22] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: i cant do that, it would violate my integrity
[18:01:31] <robertmaxrees> why's that?
[18:01:38] <daniel331> robertmaxrees: I'm looking for an input element, not a UI widget like this one: https://jqueryui.com/accordion/ :-) ;-)
[18:01:38] <sdegutis> because its the wrong code
[18:01:50] <robertmaxrees> daniel331 then clarify.
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis huh?
[18:02:00] <sdegutis> im not gonna do if (a < b) { f(a,b) } else { f(b,a) }
[18:02:02] <sdegutis> that's just wrong code.
[18:02:06] <robertmaxrees> "i don't really know javascript" -> "that's wrong code"
[18:02:22] <sdegutis> i know good code, i just dont know how to use .apply in jS
[18:02:44] <robertmaxrees> it's a pain when working with jquery, but https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[18:02:54] <robertmaxrees> first argument needs to be the correct `this` object.
[18:03:12] <sdegutis> ah thats what i was missing
[18:03:14] <daniel331> my bad. im sorry. I'm looking for a jquery plugin which is an input element. rather than having a plain dropdown box, I want it to be a bit unusual. I want the selected element in the option list to be larger and a diferent colour than its sibling unselected elements. I bet there's somehting ready made out there just like this...
[18:03:14] <syed_> robertmaxrees any update for me ?
[18:03:34] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: would that be the thing im calling .slice() on in the first place?
[18:03:44] <robertmaxrees> syed_ no idea - nothing jumps out.  somebody else might know.  i'm not on a mac so i can't test.
[18:03:45] <sdegutis> if so, it seems weird to have to call me.slice.apply(me, args)
[18:03:50] <sdegutis> cuz me is in there twice
[18:03:58] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis that's actualy what you would need to do.
[18:04:08] <sdegutis> well its still better than if
[18:04:10] <robertmaxrees> daniel331 do you have a visual example?
[18:04:15] * sdegutis sighs at JS
[18:04:15] <robertmaxrees> i disagree :)
[18:04:17] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[18:04:25] <robertmaxrees> daniel331 can't see what's in your head.
[18:04:42] <daniel331> robertmaxrees: I dont but i know ive seen things like it. you're right that I should ask for examples of things I cant describe better tho.
[18:05:02] <robertmaxrees> daniel331 where have you seen things like it?  can you share?
[18:05:26] <daniel331> cant remember atm. I may have to do it myself. when im half way done i'll come back with a visual example ;-)
[18:05:34] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[19:30:07] <berto> is it possible to prevent the user to click outside a modal ?
[19:30:26] <robertmaxrees> transparent overlay is usually your best best.
[19:34:32] <andrew9183> make the modal fullscreen
[19:34:34] <andrew9183> :D
[19:34:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:34:51] <robertmaxrees> why not just take them to a new page, then/
