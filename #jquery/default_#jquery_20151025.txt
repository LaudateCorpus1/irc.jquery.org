[00:42:01] <ilhami> hey guys
[00:42:29] <ilhami> http://pastie.org/10505602
[00:42:32] <ilhami> having a problem here
[00:42:47] <ilhami> I want to animate the background color if the scroll is more than 400
[00:47:31] <ilhami> I need to include jquery color?
[01:33:42] <ZeuZ> would it work if you used .attr to append some custom-attribute ? say like .attr("custom-color","red"); ?
[02:59:34] <arup_r> ZeuZ: use data() for custom attributes
[06:36:46] <hellyeah> yo
[06:36:50] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:03:55] <Meir`> hellyeah, you better ask your question
[07:05:50] <hellyeah> i want to send json string as paramter to method. This way is better or stringify JSON object is more prefferable?
[07:07:05] <shoky> hellyeah what's the difference?  a "stringified json object" is a "json string"
[07:08:19] <hellyeah> stringified json object is json string
[07:08:25] <hellyeah> right
[07:08:47] <shoky> var json = JSON.stringify(your_data);   $.ajax({.., data: {paramName: json}})     should be fine
[07:09:15] <shoky> well that should be a post
[07:09:44] <shoky> it'll send a regular post param called "paramName" whose value is a json string which you need to parse back into data on the backend
[07:10:01] <hellyeah> this is what i have https://jsfiddle.net/j3moc6h7/
[07:10:23] <hellyeah> okey let me try smt
[07:10:56] <shoky> ok your way with contentType of json will send the whole request body as json.  it's ok if your backend knows how to deal with that
[07:11:20] <shoky> my way is usually easier, but it depends on the backend
[07:12:09] <shoky> but for a simple GET request with those small params you can just do a regular non json request
[07:12:13] <shoky> with regular params
[07:12:33] <shoky> e.g.  data: {project_name: '..', ...}
[07:12:42] <shoky> (and removing the "contentType")
[07:13:02] <shoky> oh sorry didn't notice the type: "POST"
[07:13:58] <shoky> anyway doesn't matter much. but usually simpler works best ;p
[07:17:03] <hellyeah> i guess it smt like that
[07:17:27] <hellyeah> shoky: i am kinda in tihs business
[07:17:53] <hellyeah> so i guess POST is for posting the result of method to the browser right?
[07:18:19] <shoky> hm?  POST is for sending data from the browser to the server
[07:18:41] <hellyeah> this data is returned by a method in the backend
[07:18:50] <hellyeah> ah
[07:18:54] <hellyeah> xS
[07:19:16] <hellyeah> but i will get data from the server to the browser
[07:19:19] <hellyeah> i am confused
[07:33:11] <hellyeah> this return success hiddenfield must have stringified json buÄ±t it is empty why is that https://jsfiddle.net/mduya7tm/
[07:35:35] <shoky> hellyeah the console.log should be inside the success callback, not after the $.ajax call
[07:37:11] <hellyeah> shoky: i got this value inside the success yes but i have to use this value in another place. Is that possible to do that?
[07:38:03] <shoky> hellyeah  you can use it in any place, the place doesn't matter, what matters is the timing. it has to be AFTER the success callback has already been called.  for example, code after the $.ajax call runs BEFORE the success callback
[07:39:05] <shoky> one way to deal with it is with promises,  $.ajax returns a promise, you can carry this promise around and have multiple "success" callbacks wherever you want. but the stuff you want happening after the request success has to be inside a callback
[07:39:20] <shoky> so.. maybe learn promises or something :S
[07:39:24] <shoky> i'm off
[07:41:22] <hellyeah> ic
[07:41:33] <hellyeah> promises?
[07:48:28] <hellyeah> shoky: let me try my chancew
[07:48:34] <hellyeah> i used async:false
[07:48:40] <hellyeah> and i got this error Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.
[07:48:55] <hellyeah> do you really suggest me to us promise
[08:39:15] <hellyeah> yo
[08:39:18] <hellyeah> anyone around
[08:39:36] <hellyeah> is it good source to learn about ajax promise? http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/making-promises-with-jquery-deferred.html
[08:45:05] <SirLagz> hellyeah: there's always people around :P
[08:48:35] <hellyeah> i just want to use the data out side of function that is assign inside success funcrtion just found out two ways to do this https://jsfiddle.net/mduya7tm/1/
[08:48:48] <hellyeah> this is the first way shoky suggest me to use promise
[08:49:00] <hellyeah> then i thought i am doing ajax for async call
[08:49:10] <hellyeah> so doing async: false is not the right option
[08:49:18] <hellyeah> is that true whatcha think about that?
[08:58:22] <ilhami> http://pastie.org/10506275 performance of this code is just bad :D
[09:06:12] <hellyeah> any comment?
[09:40:35] <bondibox> why aren't these statements equivalent? The second one won't run, tried it with and without a second semicolon after the '}'  http://pastie.org/private/xy3acyjvrbhdsmpbqmsgpw
[10:38:40] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I have a form, which contains normal text-input fields but also one file-upload field. Now I want to send the text-inputs together with the selected file to my php-script. How can I do that in jQuery?
[10:38:56] <JosefDe> I'm trying it with FormData() but I haven't found out how to combine it with textfields
[11:08:39] <hellyeah> yo
[11:08:42] <hellyeah> anyone around
[11:09:31] <hellyeah> i want to use the variable i assigned in the success function in the outside.
[11:09:40] <hellyeah> for this, promise is the way to go
[11:40:28] <BustyLoli-Chan> http://pastebin.com/xYcLHAAx can someone tell me how I would make the stuff (including the for loop) wait to continue executing until the hide animation is done?
[13:17:40] <robhol> BustyLoli-Chan: chuck the rest of it in a callback
[13:33:25] <jak2000> hi all
[13:39:39] <jak2000> if i have a div with 2 class: <div class="mydiv c1"> </div> how to know the name of the div? in the event .click?
[13:55:02] <lok> l;kl;kl
[14:06:57] <grambo> have any of you sent an ajax post to spring security in order to login a user before with basic authentication?
[14:22:10] <tolgon> hey guys, I found this fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/8mnQR/1/ - that does exactly what I need but when I try to implement it - http://pastebin.com/1ui5FgnR - myself, it stops working. The only thing I changed thusfar is adding a document ready and when pasting it back in the fiddle it still runs. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong sorry :(
[14:32:53] <jak2000>  how to add an attribute to theinput text that indicate... the number of the input text?
[15:06:18] <madprops> hi
[15:06:25] <madprops> is $("#details_page").live("pageshow" ... still relevant?
[15:12:05] <madprops> i cant seem to bind a pageshow event
[16:49:51] <STFUn00b> hi guys... is there a way to detect a focusout for the whole form?
[16:50:20] <STFUn00b> i don't want to do nothing if user moves through form's elements with tab key or mouse click
[16:50:41] <STFUn00b> but as soon as the focus is on some element that doesn't belong to a certain form... i want to trigger some action
[16:51:13] <STFUn00b> .on('focusout', function() { ... document.activeElement ... returns body element
[16:51:42] <STFUn00b> is there any other way around it, besides using some small setTimeout and then checking what element has focus?
[16:52:29] <shoky> focusin?
[16:54:43] <STFUn00b> yes... but how would i know that some element that doesn't belong to a form wasn't clicked (focused in) in the mean time?
[16:56:43] <shoky> i mean, focusin for the elements outside this form
[16:57:13] <shoky> or for all elements in some container, including the form
[16:57:47] <shoky> and you can filter the listener checking if the target element is in the form or not
[16:59:49] <shoky> e.g.  $('#container').on('focusin', function(e) { if ( $(e.target).closest('.myform').length > 0 ) { return; } ... })
[17:00:46] <shoky> there's prolly nicer way to do it, depending on your actual requirement
[17:01:01] <STFUn00b> ql
[17:01:03] <STFUn00b> i'll try it
[17:22:04] <ZeuZ> http://jsfiddle.net/2bqh5wrk/ --> what can I replace animate margin-left with? right doesn't work
[21:52:36] <jak2000> <input type='text' name='xtarima_izq_0' class='inputNoTarima2' id='xtarima_izq_0' size='10' value='' data-id='0' autofocus>   <--- how to get the data-id value?
[23:47:56] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[23:48:42] <JosefDe> I have normal textfields in my form and a file upload field. I want to send them together via jQuery. How can I do that?
[23:53:21] <JosefDe> has anyone an idea how I can achieve that?
[23:56:38] <Justice> JosefDe: send them via the form?
[23:57:27] <JosefDe> Justice: I can't do that. In the destination action I have 1 parameter, which represents the form. Then I'm accessing $_FILES to get the files
[23:58:24] <JosefDe> So e. g. doing $('#formxy').serialize() doesn't work for this case
[23:59:15] <JosefDe> And if I do (new FormData()).append('file',file) --> How do I add the form-object?
