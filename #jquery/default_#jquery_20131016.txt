[00:01:41] <jphase> Cork: On line 289 and 297 of https://github.com/jphase/wysiwyg/blob/master/js/wysiwyg.js I can't seem to get those execCommand's to work despite the documentation on MDN. I've seen some ugly examples with the deprecated $.browser failovers on stackoverflow but I didn't know if you might know something off the top of your head. Don't bother if you have to read up on API for it
[00:02:35] <jphase> anli_: .html() will turn the string into a DOM object automatically so the second is redundant
[00:02:46] <anli_> ok
[00:02:50] <anli_> thx
[00:03:02] <jphase> anli_: also, the trailing / isn't necessary when interpreting in JS btw. Some people prefer it though for some reason :\
[00:03:12] <jphase> jQuery* that is
[00:03:34] <anli_> When I create the structure with $(), I prefer the slashes
[00:03:44] <anli_> Else, I am not sure if it always is accepted
[00:03:45] <jphase> hehe, case and point
[00:03:51] <jphase> it is, but yeah
[00:03:52] <jphase> ;)
[00:03:54] <anli_> :)
[00:04:18] <jphase> it will add that for you, but it's common in jQuery DOM objects, most people think it looks prettier
[00:04:31] <anli_> yeah
[00:05:39] <shoky> anli_: jquery isn't an HTML parser really, it delegates most of the parsing to the browser in either case anyway
[00:05:48] <anli_> ok
[00:06:18] <Cork> shoky: tiny adjustment, it depegates all parsing to the browser
[00:06:29] <Cork> jquery only works with dom
[00:06:35] <shoky> Cork: not for  <tagWithNoAttrs>
[00:06:41] <shoky> that's what i meant anyways ;p
[00:06:44] <Cork> heh true
[00:06:49] <goosie2020> Hey jphase is it with you if I PM you?
[00:06:52] <Cork> though not sure i call that parsing :)
[00:06:55] <shoky> ;]
[00:06:56] <anli_> heh
[00:07:01] <goosie2020> I got pastebin links setup
[00:07:04] <jphase> goosie2020: hm, sure
[00:07:53] <siovene> Hi. Any reason why jQuery would use the GET method even if I used $.post()?
[00:09:03] <sasmit87> jphase: on submit my validation is working fine
[00:09:16] <shoky> siovene: i don't remember any reason off the top of my head, but seeing your $.post code would help
[00:10:20] <Cork> jphase: anyway to answer your question, never used execCommand
[00:10:24] <erlnoob> hello, i'm using version 1.10.2. my app returns a 400 Bad Request with a response body if a POST request fails due to bad user input. what $.ajax settings do i use if i want to handle this and make use of the returned response body? it seems to me the success attribute only fires when the response is 200 OK
[00:10:31] <jnewt> i added the jquery-ui.css,  jquery.js and jquery-ui.js, added the ui-button class to a link.  what else is required to get the ui widgets to work?
[00:10:41] <Cork> siovene: are you doing cors?
[00:11:06] <siovene> shoky, it's just $.post(url, function(...) { alert("success");})
[00:11:09] <shoky> erlnoob: you can handle it in the error callback
[00:11:15] <Cork> erlnoob: error: { 400:function() {} }
[00:11:17] <siovene> Cork, I don't know what that means, so I guess not.
[00:11:36] <erlnoob> Cork: shoky: then how do i get the response body?
[00:11:41] <siovene> shoky, might it be because I'm not posting any data?
[00:12:09] <Cork> erlnoob: xhr.responseText or siblings
[00:12:11] <siovene> I just want to POST to /do_something/1234/ where 1234 is the object id.
[00:12:28] <Cork> siovene: hmm, is the server doing a redirect?
[00:12:40] <Cork> (you might be seeing the redirect target)
[00:12:48] <siovene> Cork, not according to my logs, no. Chrome's dev tool just show the attempted GET.
[00:12:50] <Cork> other then that, no it shouldn't happen
[00:13:10] <shoky> siovene: and the GET is to the exact same url? including trailing slash and all
[00:14:11] <siovene> shoky, yes
[00:15:22] <shoky> siovene: are you sure a form isn't getting submitted by accident or something?
[00:15:37] <siovene> shoky, absolutely positive
[00:16:09] <shoky> i'm out of ideas ;p
[00:16:34] <shoky> server logs showing only the GET?
[00:17:10] <siovene> shoky, yes.
[00:17:20] <shoky> funky stuff
[00:17:30] <siovene> and more importantly, so is chrome's debug window
[00:18:21] <siovene> including the network tab
[00:19:25] <shoky> maybe post a screenshot of all that.. who knows :P
[00:20:27] <siovene> ah you were right
[00:20:38] <siovene> it posts as POST, but it gets 301 Moved permantently
[00:21:35] <shoky> cool
[00:32:12] <ablegreen> Hi. If you go to my site, open up the javascript console, click on the one button, there's only 80 calls to colorThief.getColor() when there should be 300. Why? http://zyx333333333.appspot.com/
[00:32:37] <ablegreen> All the code is at right click -> view source
[00:38:48] <Cork> ablegreen: not really related to the question but you should make sure your html is valid
[00:39:12] <Cork> it isn't allowed to have anything after </body> and your missing the </html> tag
[00:39:55] <ablegreen> oops
[00:41:10] <anli_> What is the status about having script inside head?
[00:41:18] <anli_> lol
[00:41:28] <Cork> ablegreen: about the load
[00:41:33] <Cork> it is dependent on the latency
[00:43:18] <Cork> flow: 1) image 1 is grabbed and added to the image; 2) image starts to load; 3) request for next image happens (ajax); 4) image loaded; 5) image 2 starts to load; ..... 30) image 15 starts to load; 31) image 16 fetched; 32) image 16 added to do; 33) image 15 aborted
[00:43:21] <ablegreen> Cork: What is dependent on the latency?
[00:43:43] <Cork> ablegreen: if you add a new url to the image tag before the old image is loaded you will abort the loading
[00:43:45] <ablegreen> Cork: also, I just moved the scripts to the top and added the closing html tag. The count went up to 100 which is a slightly improvement
[00:43:56] <ablegreen> Cork: I see.
[00:44:07] <Cork> ablegreen: so you need to remove the for loop
[00:44:16] <Cork> and only grab a new one from the load event
[00:44:24] <Cork> or possibly the error
[00:44:28] <Cork> (if it fails)
[00:44:43] <ablegreen> Cork: I have the img tag there (it will be display:none in the future) because it needs the crossOrigin attribute for the canvas to be able to access cross site
[00:44:43] <Cork> this will significantly slow things down though
[00:45:08] <Cork> ablegreen: ya, but an img tag can't hold more then one url
[00:45:39] <Cork> ablegreen: actually i just realized an error in my flow before
[00:45:43] <ablegreen> Grab a new what from the load event?
[00:46:16] <Cork> the flow is: 1) the loop happens and 300 request is queued; 2) 4 requests at a time is fired and the one coming back last will win
[00:46:34] <Cork> so ~ 3/4 images won't be loaded cause the load is aborted
[00:46:55] <Cork> the number will differ depending on how many requests the browser allows to the same domain
[00:47:10] <ablegreen> I see
[00:47:20] <Cork> ablegreen: yes, so you know the image is loaded before you create a new request
[00:47:31] <Cork> alternatively create one img tag per ajax call
[00:47:43] <Cork> ablegreen: either way you should not use for
[00:47:58] <ablegreen> How would I keep track of how many to load then?
[00:48:27] <Cork> a variable?
[00:48:37] <ablegreen> Okay, i will try.
[00:48:56] <Cork> function makeCall(index) { if(index > 200) { return; } }
[00:49:08] <Cork> *300
[00:49:50] <ablegreen> Okay let me try
[00:50:58] <fn> does anybody know how to fix clicking links on an ipad, while i have swipedown/up events? (links are not clicking anymore)
[00:51:09] <adammcarth> jphase: You still around?
[00:52:09] <adammcarth> jphase: I managed to track another error that's being thrown when I click submit: "SyntaxError: Unexpected string (status: parseerror)
[00:52:45] <adammcarth> I'm guessing that's because I'm not parsing the json response?
[00:53:19] <jphase> adammcarth: sorry
[00:53:28] <jphase> yeah, you can .parseJSON
[00:53:53] <jphase> depends on a few things, some of which can be the server response, how you're getting the data in jQuery and some other factors
[00:54:15] <jphase> you may be able to just use $.getJSON in your case
[00:54:39] <jphase> sometimes it's nice to use jQuery's aliases they provide when there is good reason to. that's why they're there :D
[00:55:47] <adammcarth> $.getJSON instead of $.ajax?
[00:56:01] <adammcarth> or inside $.ajax
[00:56:28] <jphase> adammcarth: I would at least look up $.getJSON beause your application sounds like the use for $.getJSON ... you can use $.ajax to accomplish the same thing though
[00:56:53] <adammcarth> jphase: Okay, I'll check it out thanks
[00:57:32] <jphase> np
[00:57:50] <Cork> jphase, adammcarth if you ever do ajax and need to parse the json response it is that the server isn't configured correctly
[00:57:50] <adammcarth> jphase: But in order to "get" the json I have to make a post request first, and I'm assuming that you can't make a post request with "get"JSON....
[00:58:04] <Cork> the correct solution is to fix the server to send the correct mime type
[00:58:13] <jphase> ditto
[00:58:15] <Cork> not parsing it through $.parseJSON
[00:59:10] <Cork> adammcarth: $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', dataType: 'json' })
[00:59:43] <Cork> the dataType is only needed if the url cares about requested content type
[00:59:53] <Cork> if it doesn't then you can just do $.post(url)
[01:01:51] <adammcarth> Cork: Thanks for your help man, appreciate it. What I don't understand is, nothing needs to go into the URL to complete this post request
[01:02:09] <Cork> adammcarth: what do you mean?
[01:03:11] <adammcarth> Cork: When doing it without AJAX, you post the form to "/comment", my application takes care of it, and just outputs a nicely formatted clunk of jQuery containing either the error (if validation failed) or the actual comment so I can animate it being added if validation succeeded
[01:04:32] <fn> no idea?
[01:04:58] <Cork> fn: didn't even see you ask a question
[01:05:09] <Cork> adammcarth: ok?
[01:05:29] <b3hnam> What is wrong in my code http://dpaste.com/1418608/
[01:05:29] <b3hnam> the results is not countable for foreach
[01:06:14] <shoky> b3hnam: that JSON is not an array, you can't forEach it
[01:06:29] <Cork> b3hnam: are you sure you get json?
[01:06:40] <Cork> ah
[01:06:43] <Cork> public :)
[01:06:54] <adammcarth> back sorry
[01:07:06] <Cork> ya, it's hashes
[01:07:08] <adammcarth> Cork: Yeah, so why would I need to worry about setting a dataType for the url?
[01:07:14] <Cork> *objects
[01:07:17] <adammcarth> doesn't make sense to me
[01:07:21] <Cork> maan too much rails >_<
[01:07:24] <ablegreen> Cork: It's better than before, but it stops at ~84 when I set the limit to 100. It's just latency right? http://dpaste.com/1418608/
[01:07:29] <ablegreen> Oops wrong link
[01:07:30] <adammcarth> hahahahaha, I don't even use rails!
[01:07:42] <ablegreen> zyx333333333.appspot.com
[01:07:53] <Cork> adammcarth: that was about "hash" i said up there
[01:08:17] <Cork> adammcarth: dataType is interesting if the script checks the accept header
[01:08:33] <fn> does anybody know how to fix clicking links on an ipad, while i have swipedown/up events? (links are not clicking anymore)
[01:08:34] <fn> Cork: ^
[01:08:37] <b3hnam> Cork: How can I be sure ?
[01:08:40] <Cork> adammcarth: as dataType sets that to json/script and so on
[01:08:53] <adammcarth> hmmmmm
[01:08:55] <adammcarth> sec
[01:09:09] <Cork> b3hnam: load the url and check the content-type header
[01:09:17] <Cork> b3hnam: but ya it is json, just not an array
[01:09:42] <Cork> adammcarth: so if your script doesn't care about the accept header it isn't needed to use dataType
[01:10:04] <b3hnam> shoky: How can I parse it ?
[01:10:05] <Cork> adammcarth: what IS needed though is that the server sets the correct content-type for the response
[01:10:46] <adammcarth> Cork: Yeah, I have content_type :json working correctly
[01:10:51] <adammcarth> the output and server stuff is perfect
[01:11:02] <Cork> b3hnam: results.feed
[01:11:18] <vaishali> #javascript
[01:11:36] <ablegreen> Interesting, I think the browser is caching some of the profile images. Maybe that's why the count isn't exactly at 100.
[01:11:38] <vaishali>  /join #jquery
[01:11:57] <Cork> adammcarth: and the response data header looks correct?
[01:12:21] <adammcarth> The response that jQuery receives?
[01:12:31] <shoky> b3hnam it's an object. you access its properties like any javascript object
[01:12:45] <Cork> ablegreen: no it should work find as you bind load before you add the url
[01:13:03] <Cork> adammcarth: the browser receives
[01:13:15] <Cork> adammcarth: use the browser network tab
[01:13:19] <Cork> *browsers
[01:13:51] <b3hnam> shoky: How can I debug it to find out the methods and items of the object?
[01:14:01] <adammcarth> the chrome console says it includes networking, will that be the correct place to look?
[01:14:06] <adammcarth> Never worked with this stuff before sorry
[01:14:17] <Cork> adammcarth: yes
[01:14:23] <shoky> b3hnam:  go to the URL and look at the object
[01:14:30] <adammcarth> It throws and error when I submit the form: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined
[01:14:34] <shoky> b3hnam: and/or  console.log(data)
[01:14:34] <adammcarth> That's a JS error though obviously
[01:14:38] <adammcarth> no idea why
[01:15:13] <Cork> adammcarth: that isn't in the network tab
[01:15:19] <Cork> check the request
[01:15:41] <adammcarth> Oh fail I found it hang on
[01:16:35] <adammcarth> Name: comment Method: post Status: 200 OK
[01:16:48] <adammcarth> I'm assuming that means it's gone through correctly, right?
[01:18:54] <Cork> adammcarth: the http status yes
[01:19:01] <Cork> now check the response headers too
[01:19:05] <adammcarth> Cork: Source code can be found here btw: https://gist.github.com/adammcarthur/7003472
[01:20:47] <Cork> adammcarth: you can remove  return data;
[01:20:53] <Cork> you can't return data from success
[01:22:21] <adammcarth> yikes
[01:22:25] <adammcarth> ok, removed it.
[01:22:40] <adammcarth> Can't find anything for response headers on the new version of chrome
[01:23:27] <Cork> adammcarth: click the request and then headers
[01:23:43] <adammcarth> Got it!
[01:23:50] <adammcarth> Cork: Now, what are you looking for?
[01:23:59] <Cork> Content-Type
[01:24:40] <adammcarth> text/html;charset=utf-8
[01:24:51] <Cork> theres your problem
[01:24:57] <Cork> your sending html not json
[01:25:15] <rootshift> #css
[01:25:30] <adammcarth> I'm sending html BACK? or sending html not json TO the server?
[01:25:37] <Cork> from
[01:26:14] <Cork> so the content is taken as html, so the json isn't json it is just a long blob of characters
[01:26:33] <adammcarth> Cork: Ok fixed it, it now returns: application/json;charset=utf-8
[01:26:35] <Cork> your server needs to send content-type: application/json
[01:26:39] <Cork> nice
[01:27:03] <Cork> now data should be an object or array (depending on what you send from the server)
[01:27:40] <adammcarth> Cork: if you take another quick peak at my source code
[01:28:12] <adammcarth> it's still calling completeFailiure();  which means error is occurring?
[01:28:25] <Cork> ?g json validate
[01:28:25] <b-ot> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. → http://jsonlint.com/
[01:28:35] <Cork> try running the response data through that
[01:29:05] <adammcarth> g json validate?
[01:29:15] <Cork> check b-ot's response
[01:29:47] <adammcarth> Cork: b-ot: Alright guys I'll give that a shot
[01:29:51] <adammcarth> Mum's nagging me to come to dinner
[01:29:56] <Cork> b-ot is a bot :)
[01:29:59] <adammcarth> speak later if you're still around :P
[01:30:02] <Clorith> Am I wrong in thinking $.on is what I want to attach events to ajax loaded DOM objects ?
[01:30:04] <adammcarth> oh.
[01:30:38] <Cork> Clorith: uh, on is a combination function for all the ways you can add event listeners so... "yes" :)
[01:30:46] <shoshy> hello, for some unknown reason i get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined " , after a .draggable({..}) which worked fine before. I don't do draggable('destroy') anywhere. or something a like. I saw in the Jquery UI source that the error is in (line 2197): var t = $("body"), o = $(this).data("ui-draggable").options; , $(this) which is the element, doesn't have any
[01:30:47] <shoshy> data property. I have no idea why. Jquery UI v: 1.10.3
[01:30:54] <shoshy> any help is much appreciated
[01:31:16] <Cork> Clorith: if you're looking for a replacement for live, then check the delegate syntax for on, or delegate
[01:31:20] <Cork> ?api delegate
[01:31:20] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:31:57] <Clorith> .delegate is for <1.7 thogh, .on is the preferred after that form what I understand
[01:32:27] <Cork> Clorith: prefered ya, but it is the same thing, and .delegate is only about delegation so it is linkable
[01:32:43] <Cork> Clorith: but ya, you can express the same thing with .on, just make sure to read the documentation first
[01:33:12] <Cork> (i hate .on cause it is so freaking hard to explain for ppl...)
[01:33:56] <Clorith> It just puzzles me how it works for my already loaded objects, but new ones won't trigger at all
[01:34:05] <Clorith> I'll look some more, maybe I have a typo i nthe new ones
[01:34:20] <Cork> Clorith: cause you arn't reading the document and arn't using the delegated format
[01:34:28] <Cork> that is EXACTLY what i was just talking about
[01:34:39] <Cork> and is exactly the "hard to explain" part...
[01:35:20] <Cork> Clorith: read the documentation, on can do the same thing as delegate, but you need to express it for the delegate listener
[01:35:30] <Cork> Clorith: else you're just getting a plain bind listener
[01:36:45] <Clorith> Ohhh, I see what I'm doing wrong!
[01:37:03] <Clorith> Yeha I'm binding it the old .live way, silly me =D
[01:37:43] <Clorith> Yup, works like a charm, cheers!
[01:39:23] <ablegreen> Yeah it works Cork. THanks a lot man!
[01:39:32] <shoshy> anyone? :(
[01:40:10] <Cork> opps i never sent my response :x
[01:40:19] <ArunG> :)
[01:40:28] <ablegreen> shoshy: what's your code?
[01:40:30] <Cork> shoshy: are you sure that that option data is exposed in later versions?
[01:41:12] <shoshy> ablegreen: got tons of code.. :(
[01:41:27] <shoshy> Cork: what do you mean by exposed? i've saw it in the jquery 1.10.3 code
[01:42:37] <ablegreen> shoshy: undo the changes (if they're not significant) to the point where it did work. Then work from there? I'm no expert but that is what I do when random errors occur.
[01:45:05] <shoshy> ablegreen: I agree, but i tried to do that, up until the point i didn't had major changes... and nothing.. I've searched for something in my code, debugged it.. put breakpoints on start,stop, events, I can see that it pops not when i drop, rather than on start event.
[01:45:06] <Cork> shoshy: only reason i can see is that this isn't the element you think it is
[01:45:48] <Cork> the element you target doesn't have ui-draggable set, so draggable haven't been set on it
[01:46:23] <shoshy> Cork: you solved it to me
[01:46:29] <shoshy> right..
[01:46:34] <shoshy> i've found the error...
[01:47:01] <shoshy> it seemed i had a condition inside the "helper" method i've implemented, that if there aren't any elements , i need to re-render the template
[01:47:05] <ripthejacker> how can I check if a string is present in a list of string derived from html elements
[01:47:22] <shoshy> Thanks a lot Cork, ablegreen!
[01:47:29] <Cork> ripthejacker: what?
[01:47:47] <ablegreen> shoshy: Np.
[01:47:50] <Cork> what is it you have an array of strings? a string? or what?
[01:47:56] <Cork> ripthejacker: ^
[01:48:03] <ripthejacker> Cork: ok gotit
[01:48:14] <ripthejacker> I meant I have a string 'h'
[01:48:36] <ripthejacker> and a list of string objects , so how do I check if 'h' in present in the list
[01:48:47] <ripthejacker> 'h' is also a string object
[01:49:05] <Cork> search then
[01:49:23] <Cork> str1.search(match)
[01:49:25] <ripthejacker> Cork: it's working now , I was trying 'h'[0], just 'h' works just fine
[01:49:46] <Cork> that doesn't check if it is in the string though
[01:49:48] <ripthejacker> i used $.inArray
[01:49:53] <Cork> O_o
[01:50:02] <Cork> you convert the string to an array and loop the array?
[01:50:28] <Cork> that... is kinda wasting resources quite a bit
[01:50:46] <ripthejacker> I want to search a string in an array of strings
[01:50:54] <ripthejacker> not in another string
[01:51:00] <Cork> ah
[01:51:10] <ripthejacker> I said list of string
[01:52:06] <BrazenBraden> One always has $(document).ready();  Can one have something like $('#my_element').ready(); as well? And what effect would that have?
[01:52:34] <Cork> no
[01:52:52] <BrazenBraden> ready() is stricky for document?
[01:53:10] <Cork> ready is a compatibility wrapper around the DOMContentLoaded and load event from the document
[01:53:20] <BrazenBraden> oh ok
[01:53:28] <Cork> and those arn't fired on anything other then document and body
[01:53:35] <BrazenBraden> i see
[01:54:04] <Cork> (well tecnically you could use it for img and iframes and the like, but ready has run once code that would make that not work)
[01:54:21] <BrazenBraden> so.. if one wants to know if an element is "ready", would one rather so $('#my_element').on('load', function()); ?
[01:54:29] <Cork> nope
[01:54:36] <Cork> an element can't be ready
[01:54:44] <Cork> or loaded
[01:55:16] <Cork> if the document has fired domcontentloaded/load the orignal html is parsed
[01:55:27] <Cork> if you modify the dom afterwards there is no event for it
[01:55:31] <BrazenBraden> but if the element does not yet exist and only comes into the dom later via ajax, must one always anticipate the new element by binding it to an always present element?
[01:55:48] <Cork> BrazenBraden: then you need to use the callback from the ajax call
[01:56:07] <BrazenBraden> on('ajax:success') ?
[01:56:15] <Cork> ya, you can use that on document
[01:56:22] <BrazenBraden> alright
[01:56:27] <Cork> but it fires everytime an ajax call has succeeded
[01:56:51] <Cork> it doesn't care what is in it or what it does
[01:57:15] <Cork> BrazenBraden: if you want to handle elements that might come, it is normally simpler to just use delegated event listeners
[01:57:16] <BrazenBraden> yea.. i have all my ajax calls bound to ids of forms and links
[01:57:37] <BrazenBraden> i read delegate is synonymous with .on()
[01:57:44] <Cork> no
[01:58:01] <Cork> on can do delegate and bind
[01:58:15] <Cork> the default for on is bind syntax
[01:58:18] <BrazenBraden> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[01:58:22] <Cork> yes
[01:58:37] <Cork> but you have to make sure you make the delegate syntax for on
[01:58:39] <Cork> else you get bind
[01:58:44] <BrazenBraden> oh right
[01:58:51] <BrazenBraden> yea i have come across the difference
[01:59:03] <Cork> also there is no problem with using delegate
[01:59:19] <Cork> there is no reason to remove that support as it is very light cost to have in the lib
[01:59:29] <BrazenBraden> ok.. no deprication type warnings or anything then?
[01:59:34] <Cork> nope
[01:59:44] <BrazenBraden> and it is not going to be removed from the API in up-and-coming versions?
[01:59:50] <Cork> nope
[01:59:55] <BrazenBraden> aight
[02:00:02] <Cork> no reason it is a cost of like 15 chars to keep it
[02:00:22] <BrazenBraden> well, the function name itself but not the logic behind it lol
[02:00:51] <Cork> this is literally all that delegate does: delegate: function( selector, types, data, fn ) { return this.on( types, selector, data, fn ); }
[02:01:33] <fn> Cork: u read my question? not? ):
[02:01:34] <Cork> (same for bind and the like)
[02:02:10] <Cork> fn: ah, sorry; no i don't know of a solution for that
[02:02:59] <Cork> fn: what is the problem you're seeing?
[02:03:07] <Cork> is the link clicked by mistake or what?
[02:10:58] <anli_> Is the attributes attribute the way of listing attributes of an element?
[02:11:21] <fn> Cork: yes
[02:11:30] <fn> Cork: can't touch the body/links
[02:11:32] <fn> if i touch them
[02:11:40] <fn> it would be a touchstart/touchmove event -.-
[02:12:52] <Cork> fn: ya, was about to say do you use a script to "speed up" links by firing it from touchstart?
[02:13:06] <Cork> that would give that kind of effect
[02:13:17] <Cork> and there isn't really a way around it
[02:13:43] <Cork> anli_: it's one of the ways ya
[02:14:12] <fn> Cork: my workaround atm is that i set a "noSwipe" variable to TRUE, while clicking
[02:14:23] <fn> and a setTimeout after 2seconds to delete this variable
[02:14:35] <fn> while swipe events, i check if true or not
[02:14:45] <fn> but, is this the only way for this issue?
[02:15:10] <Cork> not sure how stopping swipe on click would fix it if it is the problem i mentioned
[02:15:23] <Cork> are you using jqm?
[02:15:40] <BrazenBraden> Cork: ah ok, not much code.
[02:16:40] <fn> Cork: not mobile
[02:16:42] <fn> the normal version
[02:16:47] <Cork> ah
[02:17:09] <Cork> or do you mean jquery?
[02:17:18] <fn> yes
[02:17:26] * Cork nods
[02:17:30] <fn> would be jquerymobile with .vclick() an option?
[02:17:54] <Cork> fn: i'm a bit confused about your problem
[02:18:12] <Cork> is it that you want to prevent the swiping while someone is clicking a link?
[02:18:19] <fn> yes
[02:18:29] <Cork> ok i took it the other way around
[02:18:30] <fn> do you have an ipad?
[02:18:31] <fn> www.thepetedesign.com/demos/onepage_scroll_demo.html
[02:18:41] <fn> can you check this with a smartphone or tablet?
[02:18:43] <Cork> fn: then you want to try to fire the links from touchstart
[02:18:54] <Cork> that way they would fire before the swipe happens
[02:19:02] <Cork> and you wouldn't need the timer
[02:19:25] <fn> how can i do that? :/
[02:19:35] <fn> not sure how i can say, do clicks before swipes
[02:19:40] <Cork> ?g javascript link touchstart
[02:19:40] <b-ot> Cork: JavaScript Touch and Gesture Events iPhone and Android - The Code → http://backtothecode.blogspot.com/2009/10/javascript-touch-and-gesture-events.html
[02:19:49] <Cork> hmm
[02:19:50] <Cork> nope
[02:20:17] <fn> may u can take a look at the demo page
[02:20:25] <fn> my site is currently based on this one
[02:20:28] <Cork> fn: if i remember correctly you do something like $(document).on('touchstart', 'a', function() { window.location = this.href; });
[02:20:54] <fn> Cork: not all 'a'-tags are links, there are also functions on some 'a's
[02:20:56] <fn> :S
[02:21:08] <fn> or other elements with clicking actions
[02:21:18] <Cork> and those doesn't have links?
[02:21:26] <Cork> (hrefs)?
[02:21:44] <fn> they have, but only for setting bigger buttons
[02:21:47] <Cork> well then you have to check that the link isn't broken
[02:21:54] <Cork> and ignore the click if it is
[02:22:11] <fn> i also have $('.xxx).on('touchstart click', function() { ... } );
[02:22:12] <Cork> (tip don't use <a> unless it is a real link)
[02:22:32] <fn> its a link, if the users browser doesn't support javascript
[02:22:38] <Cork> fn: that should work except it isn't delegated
[02:23:35] <fn> doesn't work fine
[02:23:37] <fn> mhm
[02:24:02] <Cork> fn: the touchstart event should fire before swipe
[02:24:45] <fn> Cork: did you check the demo?
[02:24:49] <Cork> no
[02:25:54] <fn> can you?
[02:26:30] <Cork> it would take more time then i can spend getting it up on a touch device
[02:29:52] <adammcarth> Cork, just updated my gist with a real json output that I made. Is there something wrong with this code?: https://gist.github.com/adammcarthur/7003472
[02:31:21] <Cork> adammcarth: no that looks ok
[02:31:28] <adammcarth> hmmm :/
[02:32:09] <Cork> adammcarth: what is status saying in error?
[02:32:42] <Cork> oh, btw you can replace  error: function(xhr, status, error) { completeFailiure(xhr, status, error); } with  error: completeFailiure
[02:32:57] <adammcarth> oh cool
[02:33:04] <adammcarth> I'll do that now and let you know what it's saying in a sec
[02:33:06] <Cork> actually same for success
[02:33:45] <adammcarth> success: determineStatus,  ?
[02:33:49] <Cork> yes
[02:35:54] <adammcarth> ok done Cork
[02:35:55] <adammcarth> now
[02:36:01] <adammcarth> the status is
[02:36:07] <Jax> i'm loading a form via some ajax request and need to submit it but not via ajax.. how can i do this? i.e it should change the url above and post the data of the form to that url
[02:36:44] <Jax> just call .submit i guess
[02:37:54] <adammcarth> Cork:   xhr: [object Object] status: parsererror error: SyntaxError: Unexpected string
[02:38:31] <Cork> adammcarth: console.log(status)
[02:38:43] <Cork> and you have nothing after string?
[02:38:56] <adammcarth> nothing after which string
[02:39:11] <Cork> adammcarth: then take the json run it through jsonlint like i said before
[02:39:14] <Cork> your json is invalid
[02:40:54] <adammcarth> I find it remarkable that my json is invalid
[02:41:20] <Cork> adammcarth: well that is what the error says
[02:41:24] <adammcarth> accessing it without ajax returns perfect code like the example I showed you before
[02:41:47] <adammcarth> Cork: And that "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ownerDocument' of undefined" has nothing to do with it?
[02:42:05] <Cork> adammcarth: when is this happening?
[02:42:18] <Cork> where do you get that error
[02:42:37] <adammcarth> Cork: Each time you click submit, it keeps accumulating.
[02:42:45] <Cork> when
[02:42:46] <adammcarth> sec I'll get you the code that's causing it
[02:42:49] <Cork> as in what line
[02:44:02] <adammcarth> line 5, but it means nothing to you
[02:44:11] <adammcarth> Have you worked in sprockets or an asset pipeline before?
[02:44:38] <Cork> doesn't really matters grab the code line in your code that when it runs causes the error
[02:45:00] <Cork> comment/remove all the code in the event handler and add it back until you get the error
[02:45:15] <Cork> or use breakpoints or what ever
[02:45:40] <adammcarth> Cork: It's just tracing the error back to where I have //require theFileThatsPerformingTheCommentAjaxStuff
[02:45:49] <adammcarth> no help at all
[02:45:52] <adammcarth> I'll try doing what you just said
[02:45:57] <Cork> then it's most likely not related to this
[02:46:13] <Cork> so again verify that your json is valid
[02:46:16] <Cork> and start from there
[02:46:38] <Cork> (and it should be/it looks like and so isn't verifying)
[02:47:02] <adammcarth> Will do
[02:47:07] <adammcarth> thanks for your help, I appreciate it
[02:48:57] <bahamas> hello. I have a button that I want to change to an iframe when the user hovers over it. can anyone give me tips on how to do it?
[02:49:30] <adammcarth> Cork: I need to serialize data for a post request, right? It's not just get is it?
[02:50:01] <Cork> adammcarth: you need to grab the value from the form elements yes
[02:50:10] <Cork> serialize or serializeArray works
[02:50:35] <Cork> bahamas: change a button to an iframe??
[02:50:48] <Cork> i would say you can't
[02:51:00] <bahamas> Cork: I have a thumbs-up button. I want to replace it with the fb-like iframe
[02:51:05] <bahamas> when the user hovers over
[02:51:27] <Cork> what you can do is have the iframe load and when the button is hovered show the iframe ontop of it
[02:51:41] <Cork> and then bind a mousemove event on your document for when it's moved outside the iframe
[02:52:44] <bahamas> Cork: so the iframe is hidden at first and then I display it on top of the button?
[02:52:52] <Cork> yes
[02:53:56] <bahamas> Cork: should I give it a class to make sure it has the same styling as the button? positioning-wise at least
[02:54:10] <Cork> bahamas: you can't style it
[02:54:22] <Cork> that would have to be done in the iframes document
[02:57:00] <bahamas> Cork: even the position of the iframe is set in the iframe document?
[02:57:05] <Cork> no
[02:57:23] <Cork> you would have to set the position and width of the iframe from the parent document
[02:57:36] <Cork> and everything else in the child one
[02:57:48] <adammcarth> Cork: I've managed to eliminate all other errors. Now it's just that so called "parse error". It says unexpected string - do I need to parse this json reponse in jquery as well maybe?
[02:57:50] <Cork> well except for the border of the iframe
[02:58:14] <Cork> adammcarth: have you run it through the lint?
[02:58:45] <Cork> btw how big is the response?
[02:58:57] <Cork> (kb/mb)
[03:01:06] <adammcarth> 434 bytes
[03:01:20] <Cork> ok so you're not sending too much data
[03:02:18] <SolarBoom> Hi All, I use datepicker, and I want when click on a date to open new tab
[03:02:25] <SolarBoom> How to do that?
[03:05:32] <Cork> SolarBoom: use the onSelect callback
[03:06:38] <SolarBoom> Cork: and then?
[03:07:01] <Cork> well do the action you want
[03:09:14] <SolarBoom> Cork: actually I want to show only 12 months of year, and when user clicks on a month it shoul be opened in a new window
[03:09:31] <adammcarth> Cork: Yeah it was the JSON -.-
[03:09:39] <steinarts> SolarBoom: afaik you cannot -force- (ie. guarantee) it to open in a new tab, but window.open with target _blank normally pops a tab
[03:09:44] <Cork> adammcarth: and valid?
[03:09:59] <adammcarth> cork: Thanks for showing me those chrome developer tools btw. Sooo useful
[03:10:47] <adammcarth> Cork: All is well. It was producing one two many commas on a conditional json string(s)
[03:11:54] <steinarts> bookmark a json validator
[03:11:59] <steinarts> it's saved my arse more than 60 times
[03:19:41] <Ivru> Hello. I'm having a question about jqueryUI widget factory. Since, there's almost nobody on #jqueryUI, can I ask here ?
[03:20:05] <Cork> Ivru: this has taken over as the ui channel yes (was quite a while a go)
[03:20:31] <Ivru> Ok, cool
[03:22:05] <Ivru> So, I'm create my own widget (let's call it A), in the _init I initialize a listener over a button, that when it get clicked, launch a second widget (call it B) of my own. The problem is, when B is removed, the listener on A doesn't work anymore.
[03:22:11] <Ivru> any idea ?
[03:22:28] <Ivru> s/I\'m/I\'ve/
[03:23:09] <Cork> Ivru: could you show some code please
[03:26:11] <Ivru> Cork, http://pastie.org/private/bqjldqygrazz1x7ur1uimq
[03:27:06] <Cork> Ivru: and contact_form is widget B?
[03:27:17] <Ivru> yes
[03:27:36] <Ivru> Cork, both, A and B are dialogs
[03:28:21] <Cork> Ivru: try using this.element.remove() instead
[03:28:57] <Ivru> i'm using that cause I'm inside the ajax success function
[03:28:59] <Cork> other then that i can't see a reason why you couldn't create a new instance of second widget from the click callback
[03:29:21] <Cork> opps missed that you do call remove the line before
[03:29:24] <Ivru> this will refer to the function, not the widget
[03:29:33] <Cork> Ivru: the remove should call _destry on it's own
[03:29:42] <Ivru> oh
[03:29:59] <Cork> so that might be what goes wrong
[03:30:30] <Ivru> Nope. Still the same problem
[03:30:39] <Cork> hmm
[03:31:05] <Cork> and you've set and are you sending the context to $.ajax?
[03:31:13] <Cork> uh...
[03:31:19] <Cork> lets try that again...
[03:31:24] <Cork> * and are you sending the context to $.ajax?
[03:32:11] <Ivru> nope
[03:32:25] <Cork> that would mean this isn't the current widget
[03:32:41] <Cork> var self = this; and then use self inside ajax instead
[03:32:43] <Ivru> Cork, that wouldn't be the right widget ?
[03:32:54] <Ivru> I'm using that for self
[03:32:57] <Cork> Ivru: this would be window if i remember corectly
[03:33:17] <Cork> as ajax isn't setting this for the callbacks
[03:33:18] <Ivru> var that=this; $.ajax(...)
[03:33:34] <Cork> ugg...
[03:33:44] <Cork> read wrong sorry
[03:34:26] <Cork> and you're sure that points to the correct widget?
[03:34:35] <Ivru> yep
[03:34:45] <Ivru> hold on the pizza just got delivred
[03:34:46] <Cork> no clue then
[03:34:54] <Ivru> thanks for trying anyway :)
[03:52:53] <steinarts> does the listener even fire ?
[03:58:57] <Cork> steinarts: you might want to address that if you want an answer :)
[04:00:29] <Ivru> steinarts, you mean ?
[04:00:55] <Ivru> the listener fire the first time, but once the widget B is closed, it doesn't fired anything
[04:01:14] <Ivru> I could try with a $.on instead of .click
[04:01:25] <Ivru> but still, sounds very strange
[04:02:27] <Guest2003> Hey - I'm selecting the following with jquery: http://pastebin.com/H3gBZkUg like this: $.trim($(this).closest('tr').children().eq(4).html()); - Now I'd like to check if it has a class and return true/false, I was trying it like this, but I always get back false. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? $.trim($(this).closest('tr').children().eq(4).hasClass('label-important'));
[04:03:18] <Cork> Guest2003: so you want td's?
[04:03:50] <Cork> Guest2003: also don't trim a true/false value :)
[04:04:05] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').children().eq(4).hasClass('label-important') should work
[04:08:31] <Guest2003> Hey cork - thanks . The contents of a td element it is yes :) I tried the thing you said but doesn't work sadly, still gives back false no matter what.
[04:09:05] <Cork> Guest2003: but do any of the td have class="label-important" ?
[04:09:55] <Guest2003> No it's a <span> element inside the <td> that has the class. Inside is this: http://pastebin.com/H3gBZkUg
[04:10:32] <Cork> ok then you arn't checking for that
[04:10:40] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[04:11:20] <Cork> i suspect what you want is $(this).closest('tr').find('.label-important').length > 0
[04:11:51] <Guest2003> So I have a table and one of the tds has in it what I linked in the pastebin. If it has label-important I want to set a variable to "0" and if it has label-success I want a variable to "1"
[04:12:36] <Cork> so var variable = $(this).closest('tr').find('.label-important').length > 0 ? '1' : '0';
[04:12:55] <Cork> though why you would want a string 0 or 1 is beside me
[04:13:10] <Cork> true and false should work just as well
[04:14:07] <Guest2003> just as an example. It'll pop up a modal and fill in the placeholder text of some fields with the current data from the row the user clicked on
[04:14:40] <Cork> ah and the server expects the field to be 1 or 0 ok i follow
[04:14:51] <Cork> then what i gave you up there should work
[04:15:11] <Guest2003> Yes it does - awesome, thanks!
[04:19:44] <Guest2003> Aside - what's this notation called? ? '1' : '0'; I was expecting to have to use if statements and then this sorcery comes along lol
[04:20:25] <_rgn> ternary operator
[04:20:47] <_rgn> (as a side note, has nothing to do with jquery)
[04:21:16] <Cork> Guest2003: inline if
[04:21:25] <Cork> Guest2003: or inline condition statement
[04:22:10] <Guest2003> I'll look into that, looks neat. thanks
[04:22:51] <Ivru> ternary operator indeed

[04:24:26] <Cork> Guest2003: ^
[04:25:04] <Guest2003> awesome
[04:35:37] <Ivru> Asking it again : I'm creating my own widget (let's call it A), in the _init I initialize a listener over a button, that when it get clicked, launch a second widget (call it B) of my own. The problem is, when B is removed, the listener on A doesn't work anymore.  Here is the code: http://pastie.org/private/bqjldqygrazz1x7ur1uimq
[04:36:00] <Ivru> trying with a $.on(..) instead of the .click doesn't help
[04:36:33] <Ivru> seems when I destroy B, A get also destroyed... (but still visible)
[04:40:12] <anli_> Cork: Seems like I could not have html like <div/>, so $('<div/>') should have some jQuery intervention after all?
[04:41:00] <Cork> anli_: yes <div/> is xhtml not html
[04:41:21] <Cork> anli_: and <div/> works by error correction
[04:41:54] <anli_> Its not only that <div/> is stricter and xhtml, its forbidden in html, confused
[04:41:55] <Cork> anli_: though jquery has special code checking for <tagName>
[04:41:59] <anli_> aha
[04:42:16] <Cork> anli_: well there is nothing as <div/> in html
[04:42:19] <anli_> ok
[04:42:29] <Cork> anli_: the reason <div/> works is cause the parser does:
[04:42:44] <Cork> 1. <div/> (/ invalid so converts it to <div>
[04:42:59] <Cork> 2. the div isn't closed to follows the error correction to close the div tag
[04:43:40] <anli_> ah
[04:43:48] <Cork> <input/> is converted to <input> and that is a self closing html tag
[04:44:06] <anli_> $('<div></div>') is not only uglier, but more correct then?
[04:44:07] <Cork> so only one section of error correction
[04:44:17] <anli_> aha
[04:44:23] <Cork> anli_: except that uses a different code path in jquery
[04:44:45] <Cork> '<div></div>' is parsed as html and is converted through domfragment
[04:44:46] <anli_> I wonder where <div/> can go wrong then
[04:45:02] <anli_> ok
[04:45:05] <Cork> well it is pointless normally
[04:45:28] <anli_> $('<div/>') is prettier than $('<div></div>'), isnt it?
[04:45:39] <Cork> but $('<div>') is the same thing
[04:45:42] <anli_> yes
[04:45:49] <anli_> But you said pointless
[04:45:51] <Cork> and $('<div></div>') isn't
[04:45:56] <Cork> no
[04:45:58] <anli_> aah, now I see
[04:46:08] <Cork> $('<div/>') is pointless $('<div>') sin't
[04:46:11] <anli_> ah
[04:46:17] <Cork> *isn't
[04:46:25] <Cork> the extra / doesn't mean anything there
[04:46:50] <anli_> And is never needed, regardless of element, then
[04:46:57] <anli_> regardless of tag name, that is
[04:47:10] <_rgn> what he means, / is redundant
[04:47:18] <Cork> yes cause jquery doesn't treat it as html
[04:47:22] <heny`> hey, i have a collapsible menu whose state i am saving in a cookie. problem is: when i hide the menu based on the cookie the menu flashes before it hides. i already tried to hide the <body> until the js has been applied but then the whole page flashes white for a split second. is there any way i can get around this?
[04:47:30] <anli_> _rgn: yes, and my follow up question is if thats regardless of tag name
[04:47:45] <Cork> $('<div>') triggers jquery to do document.createElement('div')
[04:47:50] <anli_> yeah
[04:48:23] <Cork> js> print('<div>'.match(/^<(\w+)\s*\/?>(?:<\/\1>|)$/)[0])
[04:48:35] <Cork> <_<
[04:48:37] <anli_> And $('<div><div>foobar</div>') will not have an inner div enclosing foobar then
[04:48:57] <Cork> ya, that will work through error correction, but isn't valid
[04:48:59] <b-ot> Cork: <div>
[04:49:08] <Cork> opps
[04:49:12] <Cork> js> print('<div>'.match(/^<(\w+)\s*\/?>(?:<\/\1>|)$/)[1])
[04:49:24] <Cork> man the bot is slow...
[04:49:33] <b-ot> Cork: div
[04:51:10] <heny`> i already searched so much but didn't find a non-flickering solution :(
[04:51:55] <Cork> heny`: sounds like you are running your code too late
[04:52:04] <Cork> you should run it on dom ready
[04:53:05] <heny`> Cork: i'm already doing that - http://pastebin.com/3dW9fd9j
[04:53:25] <Cork> heny`: where is ready running?
[04:53:41] <heny`> in a seperate .js file
[04:53:46] <heny`> which is loaded from the html
[04:54:20] <Cork> head or bottom of the body?
[04:55:15] <heny`> do you mean where i load the js?
[04:55:16] <heny`> head
[04:55:27] <Cork> hmm
[04:55:51] <Cork> that should work...
[04:57:43] <bberry> Anyone here well versed with jquery ui? I have a pretty tough question >.<
[04:58:50] <Simon___> Hey alle
[04:59:13] <heny`> in my css the menu ul is not at display: none because of the cookie, it could be that the user has not collapsed it so it needs to be open. also users without javascript activated should see it non-collapsed ofcourse.
[04:59:50] <heny`> i tried to hide the body by inserting a display: none on the body before dom ready
[04:59:57] <heny`> and then display: block after dom ready
[05:00:04] <heny`> which flashes the whole page white for a split second
[05:00:32] <moijk> has jquery any features that makes adding on-events with variables as static parameters? (foobar( baz ) will call foobar with baz current value)
[05:00:39] <heny`> my page is pretty long, that's the problem i guess.
[05:00:46] <heny`> but there should be a way around it!?
[05:00:48] <moijk> or will one has to do the same trick as regular?
[05:02:00] <cannap> hi
[05:02:19] <cannap>  can any tell me how can i add the rule on line 57. to the validator? http://paste.laravel.com/ZmW
[05:11:38] <Simon___> Hey all, im trying to delete a TR i have appended to but when i have checked more than 2 checkboxes it will not remove() it and then it keep added more :S http://paste.laravel.com/Znc
[05:12:45] <Simon___> Hey all, im trying to delete a TR i have appended to but when i have checked more than 2 checkboxes it will not remove() it and then it keep added more :S http://paste.laravel.com/Znc
[05:19:06] <heny`> Cork: okay, since i had really mand div's i fixed it now by inserting those div's into the page after dom ready
[05:19:12] <heny`> that makes it flicker-free
[05:25:29] <blackmesa> Hi all. when I use  $('li[class=foo]')  from the chrome devtools console I only get the first element back. anyone can help me on this?
[05:30:18] <anli_> Ah nameless input should not disturb the form it is in, right?
[05:33:13] <blackmesa> anli_: was this for me?
[05:33:23] <anli_> oh, no
[05:33:30] <anli_> Not only :)
[05:33:45] <blackmesa> :)
[05:37:30] <bberry> if i do something like var idarray = $("#divarray").children().id; will that totally not work at all? id like to get an array of ids of all children in divarray
[05:37:36] <seutje> blackmesa: what other elements do you expect it to match
[05:37:46] <seutje> blackmesa: cause it won't match <li class="foo bar">
[05:38:06] <seutje> only those where the class attribute is *exactly* "foo" and nothing but "foo"
[05:38:16] <blackmesa> seutje: yes it should only select <li> with foo class.
[05:39:04] <blackmesa> but I just found out to use $$('li[class=foo]') for all elements
[05:39:50] <blackmesa> seutje: but it still selects <li class=foo id=bar>
[05:40:28] <seutje> yeah, it should
[05:40:39] <seutje> cause it has a class attribute and it matches "foo" exactly
[05:41:17] <seutje> if u want to exclude those that have an ID attribute, u'll have to go like $('li[class="foo"]:not([id])')
[05:42:17] <blackmesa> seutje: this one works fine
[05:42:49] <blackmesa> thx mate
[05:44:59] <blackmesa> seutje: is this also possible in xpath?
[05:45:12] <seutje> probably, not too big on xpath
[05:51:32] <steinarts> blackmesa: afaik xpath has a not()
[05:51:47] <SuperHans> Hello... http://jsfiddle.net/3HwgF/7/ <<--- im trying to get the buttons to display another text when its being clicked. instead of "click me" it should display "hide" . and then back to "click me" if hide is pressed
[05:52:20] <blackmesa> steinarts: hey thx I think I found something http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2155948/xpath-select-child-elements-that-do-not-have-a-specific-name
[05:54:53] <steinarts> SuperHans: figure out how to grap the button that is being clicked. then figure out how to store the current state, and then figure out how to edit the text of the button.
[05:54:59] <steinarts> s/grap/grab
[05:55:44] <SuperHans> steinarts: im trying :)
[05:59:26] <steinarts> SuperHans: also, stop using swedish in code, like.... right away =)
[06:02:04] <SuperHans> yea i know but its for a task in school and we were told to do it. thought i changed most of it for the fiddle but apparently i missed some :)
[06:04:17] <seutje> SuperHans: they force you to use swedish in HTML classes? o.O
[06:08:05] <SuperHans> not really. but a few of my classmates wanted us to use swedish names on our classes/id's to make it easier to understand. i dont know why :)
[06:08:24] <grafi> oô
[06:08:33] <grafi> oh oh oh
[06:13:55] <airdem> whats a good way to transmit HTML data from php to jquery?
[06:14:32] <seutje> http
[06:14:38] <grafi> dafuq
[06:15:17] <airdem> was thinkink to put it into a data-html="" attribute
[06:15:25] <airdem> *thining
[06:15:28] <airdem> lol :)
[06:16:10] <seutje> so ur using html to send extra html?
[06:16:16] <airdem> yes
[06:16:20] <seutje> enjoy the escaping :D
[06:16:51] <airdem> exactly :) thats why i wonder if there is a simple way to do this
[06:17:02] <airdem> would json help?
[06:17:17] <seutje> not rly, since ur ditching matkup and data in there together
[06:17:42] <seutje> suppose it's slightly less parsing, but I'm pretty sure data attributes are largely ignored during parsing
[06:33:12] <steinarts> javascript variables ?
[06:33:25] <slax0r> var variable_name = 'value';
[06:34:17] <steinarts> airdem: use javascript variables? var myhtml = "<div onclick='alert(1)'></div>";
[06:35:30] <Cork> eh...
[06:35:43] <Cork> html belongs in the html file not in js variables
[06:36:38] <steinarts> Cork: i agree, but im answering a question
[06:37:37] <steinarts> also, xhr kinda was invented to pass html to javascript variables ;P
[06:37:58] <Cork> well passing and storing is two different things
[06:38:20] <Cork> the problem isn't the variable but the string with html in it
[06:39:31] <steinarts> again, i agree. but i'd like to see jquery work without having strings with html
[06:40:10] <Cork> steinarts: that is simple
[06:40:17] <Cork> i never do for example
[06:45:05] <steinarts> thats nice, i have to go :)
[06:51:29] <g33kyboi> Hi
[06:52:35] <g33kyboi> I try to dynamically load html fragment into a div section of another page but I keep getting unrecognised expression error.
[06:52:42] <g33kyboi> here code: http://pastebin.com/KABdPprj
[06:53:07] <g33kyboi> the error too is on the same pastebin link. thanks
[06:53:28] <Cork> g33kyboi: $(resp) => $($.parseHTML(resp))
[06:54:30] <Cork> g33kyboi: and $('#errorMessage', $.parseHTML('Error occurred. Please try again.')) doesn't make sense
[06:54:54] <Cork> you most likely want $('#errorMessage').text('Error occurred. Please try again.')
[06:55:56] <g33kyboi> Cork: was doing that from a suggestion I got. I had this before $('#errorMessage').html();
[06:56:25] <Cork> g33kyboi: the second argument to $() can be a parent
[06:56:34] <Cork> what you have isn't valid at all
[06:56:39] <g33kyboi> yes... .text(string). thanks
[06:56:54] <g33kyboi> okay. I'll correct that now
[07:06:41] <sunuslee> hi, is javascript has this syntax?   var a=u'some-werid-strings'
[07:07:07] <sunuslee> i mean, is there a u prefix?  i could not find it online, but i can do this in my code. why?
[07:07:26] <Cork> sunbeam: not as far as i know no
[07:08:25] <Cork> sunbeam: looks like python
[07:08:47] <Cork> at least that is the only language i know of that uses u""
[07:10:48] <grafi> oô
[07:10:58] <grafi> what does u"" do Cork?
[07:11:08] <Cork> ?g python u string
[07:11:09] <b-ot> Cork: Unicode HOWTO — Python v2.7.5 documentation → http://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html
[07:11:27] <grafi> the more you know
[07:12:10] <sunuslee> Cork:  yeah, i mean. in javascript
[07:12:50] <Cork> sunbeam: ya, i know but like i said the only language i know of that uses it is python
[07:13:10] <Cork> u"" isn't even valid syntax in js
[07:13:15] <sunuslee> in someone's code. it was:   var weiboData = {'qqTitle': '\xe5\x88\x9a\xe4\xb9\xb0\xe7\x9a\x84'}
[07:13:38] <Cork> ya, that is unicode escaped for ascii
[07:14:10] <sunuslee> it's unreadable. so i change it to u'刚买的'
[07:14:11] <sunuslee> and it work
[07:14:17] <Cork> :)
[07:14:22] <Cork> ya js is unicode
[07:14:29] <Cork> always unicode
[07:14:31] <sunuslee> but, if it's just '刚买的'  then, it can not work
[07:14:41] <sunuslee> so, i don't know what is going wrong
[07:15:05] <Cork> try reproduce it in jsfiddle
[07:16:12] <sunuslee> ok, let me try
[07:19:02] <sunuslee> okay i found out, it's my mistake
[07:19:24] <sunuslee> with or without u prefix. it makes not diffierent

[07:46:34] <audioteks> Hey guys I need help integrating Google Maps into my jquery onload jsfiddle.net/PYpF4/82
[07:48:29] <audioteks> Http://jsfiddle.net/PYpF4/82/#&togetherjs=aDV2eFaiDj
[08:42:39] <BillCriswell> Does anyone know if there's a way in Chrome to view all the CSS rules in one place?
[08:47:58] <DarsVaeda> how do I find if an element has a specific parent somewhere up the tree?
[08:48:06] <DarsVaeda> do I use .closest?
[08:50:02] <WebDragon> BillCriswell: doubtful, unless you load it from the resources or sources tabs, but that does not necessarily indicate which values are being used
[08:51:28] <Gigs-> So yesterday we discovered a critical flaw in our large jquery app.  We AJAX in content all over the place, and every .on() we were doing was making a new binding every time someone triggered an ajax load.  Most of our events were idempotent so we didn't notice it sooner, but we did know our app got slower and slower over time on low resource devices.  We added .off() before every on, but is there a more general pattern to prevent this problem?
[08:53:23] <jedimind> dont use jquery for routing? :)
[08:54:49] <sacho> Gigs-, sure, Ajax_Stuff.init() -> if (Ajax_Stuff.hasInit) return; // otherwise, init
[08:55:22] <olivvv> Gigs: Event Delegation ?
[08:56:04] <duch_kazatel> yeah gigs event delegation.
[08:56:06] <duch_kazatel> bind once.
[08:56:08] <Gigs-> we do use delegation, this is like "ajaxed popup windows"
[08:56:20] <bberry> is there a "best way" to insert a div into another div via jquery?
[08:56:26] <Gigs-> sacho's suggestion might be best though
[08:56:27] <sacho> Gigs-, you definitely shouldn't have free-executing code that doesn't check whether you've already initialized
[08:56:53] <olivvv> Gigs:or for every module/gadget/stuff that you use an init() method and a destroy() method
[08:57:22] <Gigs-> sacho: well most of it does need to reinit, since the ajaxed in part of the dom gets destroyed when the ajaxed "window" is closed
[08:57:32] <olivvv> because you dont need to keep in memory what you are not using anymore
[08:57:49] <Gigs-> sacho: but we could use your suggestion to either make a "destructor" or selective init
[08:57:55] <sacho> selective init
[09:04:04] <bberry> how do i insert a div into another div via jquery?
[09:04:58] <olivvv> bberry:http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[09:08:32] <bberry> mmk. ty.
[09:12:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, when you enter something in a textbox and use the on blur event to save the values, it will not run when immediately after typing you go to the form submit button
[09:12:59] <nsanden_> im kinda stumped on how to do this, i want to be able to click the up/down buttons and have it move the div up or down http://jsfiddle.net/9nnMM/2/
[09:13:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is there a way to avoid this?
[09:18:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: good morning
[09:19:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hi
[09:19:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> nsanden_: play around wiht offset
[09:19:13] <BillCriswell> nsanden_: What have you tried?
[09:19:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: you have exmaple
[09:19:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> like jsfiddle
[09:19:40] <nsanden_> i dont think i made it very clear, when i say move up, i mean in the dom
[09:20:02] <nsanden_> so if you clicked the test2 move up button, the new order of divs would be test2, test1, test3, test4, test5
[09:20:27] <duch_kazatel> nsanden_ that's terribly inefficient.
[09:21:38] <NoiseEee> nsanden_: why do you care where it is in the DOM?  let CSS take care of positioning
[09:22:16] <nsanden_> because this would be an interface for sorting elements
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> nsanden_ why not swap contents of containers?
[09:22:32] <duch_kazatel> or use CSS?
[09:23:11] <nsanden_> i could probably hack together something to swap contents, but i cant think of how id use css
[09:23:41] <nsanden_> can you enlighten me
[09:25:03] <BillCriswell> nsanden_: http://jsfiddle.net/9nnMM/3/ I got the up for you, you have to get the down. =p
[09:25:53] <nsanden_> BillCriswell: thank you!
[09:27:05] <BillCriswell> nsanden_: No problem.
[09:31:05] <bee_keeper> hi, i have a full width image carousel.  i want to maintain a fixed height for the carousel but when i resize the browser width i want the image to be scaled and cropped for a best fit to the new browser size.  Can anyone recommend a good plugin for this?  And also, is this a credible solution?
[09:33:14] <BillCriswell> bee_keeper: http://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/ should be able to help you
[09:33:47] <BillCriswell> I wish he used a nicer background image there.
[09:37:49] <bee_keeper> BillCriswell: i suppose that fits the bill.  thanks.  it seems that if you want really perfect results you need to create the image to fit the dimensions you're working with

[09:45:56] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone... I'm having some issues with VERY SLOW animation using Isotope in IE8. I realize that IE8 is performing the animation using pure Javascript (ie. not CSS) but given the number of elements I'm using it doesn't seem like it should be working so slowly.
[09:46:11] <inv3nt0r> The page in question is http://roastudio.com/roa/
[09:49:06] <bberry> inv3nt0r: No idea. site looks nice tho :D
[09:50:05] <inv3nt0r> bberry: Thanks, it has a few issues yet to work out...
[09:50:51] <inv3nt0r> bberry: I think I'm going to create a conditional page for < IE8 users which doesn't use Isotope... Oddly a lot of people are still using that browser
[09:55:19] <bberry> :(
[09:57:00] <NoiseEee> wow inv3nt0r, that fancy building is in *chatham* ?
[10:02:28] <kilian123> does anybody want to test an responsive layout?
[10:02:50] <inv3nt0r> NoiseEee: Could be... Depends what building you mean
[10:03:10] <inv3nt0r> NoiseEee: The St. Clair HealthPlex if in Chatham if thats what you mean...
[10:03:30] <kilian123> any layout issues on http://www.vegpool.de/wegweiser/zuerich/index.html?style=responsive ?
[10:03:41] <kilian123> its a new responsive design i am working on
[10:03:43] <NoiseEee> inv3nt0r: neat
[10:04:38] <inv3nt0r> NoiseEee: Yes it is a nice building... very few right angles :)
[10:05:23] <bberry> why wont this work? it is probably something stupid...http://jsfiddle.net/NTKYB/
[10:07:13] <bberry> nevermind
[10:07:14] <bberry> im an idiot
[10:10:04] <kilian123> bberry: why do you put a function inside a function?
[10:10:17] <kilian123> why not $().click(function(append().....));?
[10:10:43] <kilian123> $("#addButton").on("click", function(){
[10:10:43] <kilian123>     $("#container").append("<p>Test</p>");
[10:10:43] <kilian123> });
[10:12:33] <kilian123> berry
[10:12:40] <kilian123> you refer to an ID instead of a class
[10:12:44] <kilian123> $(".container")
[10:12:51] <kilian123> not $("#container")
[10:13:27] <kilian123>     $("#addButton").click(function(){
[10:13:27] <kilian123>     $(".container").append("<p>Test</p>");
[10:13:27] <kilian123>     });
[10:13:28] <kilian123> this works
[10:13:37] <bberry> yeah, i got it.
[10:13:48] <bberry> accidentally switched one thing and not th eother
[10:22:29] <cronin> Why doesn't this register an on change event? http://jsfiddle.net/bU7DG/
[10:23:06] <Velveeta> it does..
[10:23:16] <Velveeta> oh i see what you're saying
[10:23:18] <cronin> When you first run it, an alert doesn't pop up.
[10:23:19] <Velveeta> when you run .prop
[10:23:29] <cronin> Yea, I want it to register when United States is set
[10:23:30] <Velveeta> because change events aren't triggered for programmatic changes
[10:23:42] <Velveeta> if you change the value programmatic, you have to manually trigger the change event
[10:23:50] <BillCriswell> cronin: You have to trigger that jawn.
[10:24:16] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/bU7DG/2/
[10:24:23] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Ayyyyyyyyy
[10:24:29] <Velveeta> ayyyyyyyy!
[10:25:20] <cronin> Interesting. I've never run across this issue before but good to know! I just needed to move it below the on change and then call .trigger('change'); Thanks Velveeta and BillCriswell

[10:27:36] <BillCriswell> We should like a couple of Fonsies.
[10:28:04] <BillCriswell> Fonzies*
[10:28:05] <Distraught> how do i remove a post var before its submited?
[10:28:12] <Distraught>   document.getElementById("style_code").value == null;
[10:28:13] <Distraught>   document.getElementById("yo").submit();
[10:28:17] <Velveeta> i thought we sounded like a group of t-bird'ish goombas, ay-oh-oh-ay!
[10:28:21] <Distraught> I am trying this with no result
[10:28:49] <Velveeta> you're not removing the var, you're just nulling it out
[10:28:59] <Distraught> Velveeta how can i remove this var?
[10:29:01] <BillCriswell> Distraught: Not even nulling it out.
[10:29:06] <Distraught> oh
[10:29:07] <Distraught> :S
[10:29:07] <Velveeta> you need to actually remove it from the dom
[10:29:17] <Velveeta> oh yeah, you're just comparing it to null
[10:29:18] <Distraught> so its .remove
[10:29:19] <Distraught> ?
[10:29:20] <BillCriswell> $('#style_code').remove()
[10:29:21] * Velveeta smacks himself.
[10:29:43] <Distraught> its still posting
[10:30:04] <Velveeta> so browsers are getting smarter about dom manipulation
[10:30:05] <bberry> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/QUS7R/1/
[10:30:12] <bberry> :P
[10:30:19] <BillCriswell> Distraught: Then there's something going on you're not telling us.
[10:30:25] <bberry> No idea why it works with <div>s but it does!
[10:30:53] <Velveeta> distraught: can you post a jsfiddle example?
[10:31:33] <BillCriswell> Distraught: Does the element you're trying to remove have id="style_guide"?
[10:31:46] <Velveeta> style_code*
[10:31:54] <Velveeta> bberry: glad to hear you got it working then :)
[10:32:00] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah whateva.
[10:32:23] <bberry> Velveeta: As am i. finally! >.<
[10:32:32] <Velveeta> :D
[10:32:51] <Distraught> http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:33:13] <Distraught> Well i found out i neet to remove and the style_category element if it has the value "default"
[10:33:32] <Distraught> in the fiddle i have written null
[10:34:20] <BillCriswell> Distraught: Need a better link than that. =p
[10:34:31] <Velveeta> yeah, that's to the main site
[10:34:31] <Distraught> hehe
[10:34:44] <Distraught> You need and the elements?
[10:35:16] <Distraught> well can i post a link to see what is all about?
[10:42:30] <jedimind> Distraught you have ot hit save
[10:42:36] <jedimind> then post the URL of that saved fiddle
[10:42:42] <jedimind> not just the link to jsfiddle.net
[10:44:26] <bberry> So i have this simple thing here.  As far as updating what is in the dom (my UpdateContainer function), is there a much better way of doing this then reloading the entire array?  I feel like itd be better to detect the changes in the array of objects and just update the container div with those changes.
[10:44:28] <bberry> http://jsfiddle.net/NTKYB/1/
[10:46:40] <duch_kazatel> bberry you can't "watch" vars like that.
[10:47:22] <bberry> :( i was thinking about making another array and comparing the two
[10:47:42] <Distraught>  var gg = $('#style_category').value;
[10:48:10] <Distraught> help?
[10:48:15] <bberry> duch_kazatel: Im a little bit concerned doing it this way because it could be operating on an array with many many objects in it
[10:48:29] <bberry> Distraught: var gg = $("#style_category").val()
[10:48:54] <Distraught> bberry thanx. Really. Thanx
[10:49:05] <bberry> :D
[10:49:52] <HD|Laptop> hey
[10:50:06] <HD|Laptop> can I in the focusout event determine which item got the focus?
[10:51:32] <duch_kazatel> HD|Laptop check out the event target - that should tell you where the event came from.
[10:51:46] <HD|Laptop> thx
[11:02:03] <HD|Laptop> duch_kazatel: ev.target is the inputbox where the focus was

[11:53:07] <jimmt> http://i.imgur.com/y6bQf1j.png is there a way I'd be able to reference the parent function's this.lastX or this.lastY from inside the mousedown function I'm defining?
[11:56:23] <jimmt> never mind
[12:07:57] <goosie2020> Whats the easiest way to do a simple alert with jQuery? Something that doesn't rely on a div with content in it like the "dialog" function does? Something like "jQuery.alert("Helloworld");"
[12:08:27] <g33kyboi1> I am using jquery validation plugin, I want to call another function at the end of the validation (if all the form field values are correct). But I'm not getting it right.

[12:36:56] <robschmuecker> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, you around?
[12:37:26] <uGoMobi> hey robschmuecker
[12:38:22] <robschmuecker> Hi Jasper, just responde to your comment on ticket #6356
[12:38:29] <robschmuecker> Hi Jasper, just responded to your comment on ticket #6356
[12:38:38] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: ok thanks
[12:39:17] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: we don't use sprites anymore
[12:39:28] <robschmuecker> I'll happily reformat the SVG's and export to PNG and create a PR.  Just wondering if there's a particular format for exporting the PNG's?  OK no more sprites - cool.
[12:40:06] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: actually I don't know about the PNG exporting
[12:40:13] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: we used Grunticon for it
[12:40:25] <uGoMobi> and afterwards someone did a PR to optimize them
[12:40:46] <robschmuecker> Also the SVG's seem to have a lot of unnecessary padding in the form of <g> </g>'s !  I'll get rid of that too.
[12:40:48] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: Grunticon: https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon
[12:41:00] <robschmuecker> ok grunticon ;)
[12:41:27] <robschmuecker> ok, I'm away from tomorrow morning until Sunday so will submit a PR next week sometime.
[12:41:55] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: great if you can do a cleanup, but it might be good to do that in a separate commit
[12:42:16] <robschmuecker> sure thing, will do.
[12:42:29] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: awesome, thanks!
[12:42:41] <robschmuecker> uGoMobi: ok, catch you next week Jasper. - Gotta go pack now :)
[12:43:03] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: we will probably release 1.4 RC on Monday, so this might not make it into 1.4.0
[12:43:32] <uGoMobi> but we will release 1.4.1 few weeks later so we can land it in there
[12:43:33] <robschmuecker> ok - is that a deal-breaker?
[12:43:43] <robschmuecker> ok cool. Good night
[12:43:47] <uGoMobi> we can't make any changes between RC and final
[12:43:56] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: ok, thanks again
[12:44:02] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: good night!
[12:44:04] <robschmuecker> pleasure - been a while !

[13:42:57] <Lazuratus> zakj: Finaly had a change to test it, and underscore.js' difference worked great! thx a lot!
[13:50:11] <shoky> plambwk: guessing you wanted something more like this http://jsfiddle.net/V8xau/2/
[13:50:30] <plambwk> lol ya
[13:50:33] <plambwk> thats exactly it
[13:50:45] <plambwk> did you only modify jquery?
[13:50:59] <shoky> also added the class to the <th>s
[13:51:04] <plambwk> i see
[13:51:17] <plambwk> thank you
[13:51:26] <shoky> np
[13:52:23] <plambwk> you added that class
[13:52:38] <plambwk> so the jquery didnt execute on the th's that were headings for the features
[13:52:41] <plambwk> like Architecture
[13:52:42] <plambwk> correct?
[13:53:05] <shoky> yeah and the ones in the header/footer
[13:53:21] <plambwk> cool
[13:53:24] <plambwk> makes sense
[13:53:24] <shoky> and also so that i can easily query for all of them
[14:11:54] <TeraJL> what type of mess can be done by the user settings an 'a' element on the page?... like <a href="javascript:makesomemess()">teste</a> etc? if i remove the "javascript:" from the beggining i'm clean?
[14:13:01] <Armistice> For example: Should I do $("div").find("p") when I can do $("div p") ? I mean...  are there any performance differences and what not?
[14:52:18] <zakj> Lazuratus: glad to hear it!
[14:58:20] <Ericx2x> Is it better to use jquery or css for this type of tab thing? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12883232/buttons.png
[15:04:18] <alexxxx85> can somene please tell me wich channel can i ask for asp.net questions?
[15:05:31] <duch_kazatel> alexxxx85 you can search - /list *searchword*
[15:05:40] <alexxxx85> thank you
[15:05:47] <duch_kazatel> the asterisks are wildcards
[15:08:54] <malorie> I'm placing random images via .html and I'd like to determine their height, so I can place them randomnly within a certain range. the thing is, that .height() sometimes returns an incorrect height. why is that happening? is .html() not finished when I call .height()?
[15:09:41] <duch_kazatel> malorie have a fiddle?
[15:10:15] <malorie> no. but I could post the relevant js, if that helps?
[15:10:56] <duch_kazatel> malorie don't post into the channel - use something like jsfiddle.
[15:11:05] <duch_kazatel> i'll see if I can help out.
[15:12:24] <malorie> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/wxdsL/
[15:13:46] <duch_kazatel> ah i see.  you're trying to get the height before it finishes loading probably.
[15:13:56] <malorie> yeah :\
[15:14:03] <malorie> I thought .html() was synchroneous, though?
[15:14:29] <duch_kazatel> you still have to have a callback when the image completes loading.
[15:14:38] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you wind up with this race condition.
[15:15:01] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14134393/get-image-height-after-image-has-loaded
[15:15:05] <duch_kazatel> something like that should help.
[15:15:24] <duch_kazatel> you need to load the image and then get the height - that callback will help.
[15:15:35] <malorie> swett, thanks :-)
[15:15:38] <duch_kazatel> np
[15:41:38] <nezZario> um
[15:41:57] <nezZario> I thought I could do $('foo').on('focus', function() { .. }, 'blur', function() { .. }); ?
[15:42:50] <eddiemonge> $('foo').on('focus', function() { .. }).on('blur', function() { .. });
[15:43:28] <eddiemonge> or $('foo').on('focus blur', function(e) { if ( e.type) {  }  if ( e.type) {  }  });
[15:43:38] <eddiemonge> might not be type but general idea
[15:45:04] <nezZario> eddiemonge: thanks for clearing that up

[15:49:05] <blindMoe> maybe data[i] does not exist?

[15:49:43] <blindMoe> console.log it and see if it is actually an array
[15:49:44] <eddiemonge> console.log it. you should never use alert for debugging
[15:49:47] <goosie2020> it is

[15:50:51] <eddiemonge> of
[15:51:00] <goosie2020> what do you mean
[15:51:05] <blindMoe> my guess would be data[i]
[15:51:18] <blindMoe> goosie2020: did you console.log(data) or console.log(data[i])  ?
[15:51:31] <eddiemonge> what did you console.log to get that output? could you gist or fiddle your actual code?
[15:52:00] <goosie2020> pastebin ok?

[16:12:56] <goosie2020> eddie...my man
[16:13:31] <goosie2020> no more eddie
[16:14:40] <zakj> goosie2020: remove the "$(function () {" and matching closing brace from your json response callback
[16:20:05] <eddiemonge> cannap: what is ajaxForm?
[16:21:26] <eddiemonge> goosie2020: you should use the echo ...; exit(); just in case
[16:21:26] <eddiemonge> zakj: not necessary

[16:24:45] <eddiemonge> nhulea: with what code?
[16:25:01] <nhulea> it seems there is a conflict between an iframe and a dialog

[16:26:06] <nhulea> hold on
[16:29:29] <zakj> goosie2020, eddiemonge: ha, off by one error. i <= data.length should be i < data.length
[16:29:59] <zakj> amazing how easy that is to miss
[16:30:13] <talntid> indeed
[16:32:55] <eddiemonge> if that fixes it
[16:33:07] <eddiemonge> the problem was with data[0], not data[4]
[16:33:12] <walidvb> hi guys, is there a plugin to drag a file from the browser to the desktop?
[16:33:26] <tripflex> is there no easy way to submit a form as json object?
[16:33:35] <zakj> eddiemonge: fair point; that is likely not the sole problem ;)
[16:34:14] <duch_kazatel> trip sure there is - go through your form data, convert the whole thing to JSON, then use $.ajax() to submit that to the server.
[16:34:24] <duch_kazatel> unless you're looking for a plugin or something.
[16:34:29] <tripflex> yeah that's what i was afraid of
[16:34:30] <duch_kazatel> err, tripflex
[16:34:38] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  why is that so terrible?
[16:34:39] <eddiemonge> tripflex: you mean as a string that can be decoded to json?
[16:34:47] <tripflex> i mean like
[16:35:00] <eddiemonge> or do you want .serialize() ?
[16:35:06] <tripflex> $('#myform').serialize() will give you input=vallue&input2=value2
[16:35:19] <tripflex> but is there an easy way like that to convert it to json
[16:35:23] <tripflex> from what i found there isnt
[16:35:40] <eddiemonge> do you really need it as json in the server?
[16:35:49] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-js-object-with-jquery
[16:36:19] <tripflex> heh
[16:36:22] <tripflex> i'm helping a friend out
[16:36:27] <tripflex> he has to submit data to this verification company
[16:36:34] <tripflex> and for some stupid reason they want a post with json data
[16:36:44] <malorie> duch_kazatel: hey, I'm facing a similar problem with loading random text into a div, and then calling a function on that div, but the .load() trick doesn't seem to work. do you happen to have any ideas here as well?
[16:36:50] <tripflex> now if it was my app he was running i would just post it using node or something
[16:37:05] <tripflex> but im just trying to slap together a quick html page to give to him
[16:37:41] <duch_kazatel> malorie you need a success callback when the text is inserted.
[16:38:08] <duch_kazatel> malorie how are you retrieving the text?
[16:38:30] <malorie> the texts are stored in a js array that's in scope
[16:38:36] <nhulea> here is a fiddle with the error in the console log http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/pSyhD/
[16:38:42] <nhulea> the error is Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://fiddle.jshell.net" from accessing a frame with origin "http://jsfiddle.net". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
[16:38:44] <malorie> so I'm basically accessing it via index :-)

[16:55:08] <malorie> duch_kazatel: you still with me? otherwise I'll go to bed and further investigate tomorrow :-)
[16:56:29] <cannap> i hate js :(
[17:03:49] <say2joe> blashemy!!!!!!!!!
[17:04:17] <cannap> works!!
[17:04:18] <cannap> yes
[17:25:23] <menikmati> why cant i do this? $('.clearfix.user_in_list .quiet')[i].text(); ?
[17:25:30] <menikmati> i get has no method text
[17:26:16] <duch_kazatel> because $('.clearfix.user_in_list .quiet')[i] is not a jquery object.
[17:26:23] <menikmati> i'm using it in a for loop by the way
[17:26:25] <duch_kazatel> $($('.clearfix.user_in_list .quiet')[i]).text() would work.
[17:26:37] <duch_kazatel> you're returining an object in an array
[17:26:58] <menikmati> ok so how would i use it in a for loop?
[17:27:14] <fender0107401> /exit
[17:28:34] <duch_kazatel> menikmati just showed you.
[17:28:43] <duch_kazatel> $($('.clearfix.user_in_list .quiet')[i]).text()
[17:28:51] <duch_kazatel> or craft an array that has jquery objects.
[17:30:33] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/GtbT5/
[17:30:42] <menikmati> would that work with .each?
[17:30:43] <tripflex> am i just going crazy because its been a hot minute since i used jquery
[17:30:56] <tripflex> can someone tell me what i have wrong in that code?
[17:31:19] <duch_kazatel> menikmati yes, it would.
[17:31:23] <duch_kazatel> oh wait.
[17:31:27] <duch_kazatel> menikmati show code.
[17:31:55] <duch_kazatel> tripflex you want .on()
[17:32:47] <duch_kazatel> tripflex oh that version of .change() uses .on.
[17:32:48] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[17:32:55] <menikmati> here http://prntscr.com/1xt148
[17:33:03] <menikmati> not sure how to get access to the span text
[17:33:08] <menikmati> using .each
[17:33:14] <tripflex> yeah that's what i thought it did
[17:33:18] <tripflex> was basically a shortcut for it
[17:33:38] <duch_kazatel> menikmati try $(this).text()
[17:33:53] <menikmati> sweet!
[17:33:55] <menikmati> thanks
[17:34:36] <duch_kazatel> tripflex oh you have bad markup - <div id="#CompanyTitleGroup">
[17:34:38] <duch_kazatel> that's wrong ;)
[17:35:48] <tripflex> ahhahaha
[17:35:50] <tripflex> oh man
[17:35:53] <tripflex> time to go home
[17:35:56] <duch_kazatel> don't worry, we've all been there ;)
[17:35:58] <tripflex> thanks you
[17:36:10] <duch_kazatel> np
[17:37:04] <tripflex> haha oh wow
[17:37:12] <tripflex> i def spent like 15 min trying to figure that out
[17:37:23] <tripflex> liek wtf why isnt it returning anything
[17:37:34] <Assimilater> menikmati: fyi each is also a method of jQuery.fn, meaning you can do $('.clearfix.user_in_list .quiet').each(function() {} );
[17:37:58] <duch_kazatel> don't worry - it took me and one other dev helping a third figure out what was wrong with his code once.  it was an extra semicolon at the end of a line.
[17:39:24] <duch_kazatel> took about 10 minutes.
[17:40:00] <nights> hi
[17:40:15] <nights> have a vertically fixed/scrolling cart
[17:40:27] <relipse> what is a common reason the $() always returns null?
[17:40:28] <nights> im trying with very simple logic decide if it should be fixed or scrolling
[17:40:36] <nights> however
[17:40:38] <nights> this expression
[17:40:40] <nights> if( $(window).height() < $('#menu_sidebar').height()+150 )
[17:40:49] <nights> seem to change depending on the scroll of the site
[17:40:52] <nights> how is this possible
[17:41:01] <nights> neither of the width of the container or browser height is changing
[17:41:52] <duch_kazatel> relipse is $ defined?
[17:42:32] <relipse> duch_kazatel, yeah but it doesnt look right: http://pastebin.com/SnpDudKH
[17:43:03] <duch_kazatel> nowhere in that code is $ defined.
[17:43:33] <relipse> i typed that into chrome console
[17:43:38] <relipse> and that is what it gave me
[17:43:45] <duch_kazatel> wait are you trying to use jquery?
[17:43:45] <relipse> i mean i typed $ into chrome console
[17:43:58] <duch_kazatel> back up - what are you trying to do?
[17:43:59] <relipse> yes thats why i'm in #jquery
[17:44:05] <relipse> jquery $ is not working properly
[17:44:14] <duch_kazatel> err, not with that code.
[17:44:15] <relipse> basically it is getting defined elsewhere and i'm not sure why
[17:44:21] <relipse> thats not my code
[17:45:01] <duch_kazatel> is jQuery defined on the page?
[17:46:05] <relipse> yeah
[17:46:26] <relipse> but something is robbing my $
[17:46:26] <duch_kazatel> then there's a noconflict or something else redefining $()
[17:46:33] <duch_kazatel> mootools on the page?
[17:46:38] <relipse> dont think so
[17:51:50] <MRX> I'm trying to use tooltips with jQuery UI (from http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/ )
[17:52:00] <MRX> but i can't use html formatting on the tooltips
[17:52:20] <MRX> for example: i cant make various lines on the tooltip, underline, etc
[17:54:32] <relipse> MRX, does it even support it?
[17:54:51] <MRX> i don't know
[17:54:54] <relipse> i dont see any html examples in that
[17:54:59] <relipse> so my guess is it doesnt suppor it
[17:55:05] <relipse> if you wanted toa dd custom support you could probably
[18:03:14] <MRX> i'm searching what stops it from parsing the html..
[18:17:03] <MRX> relipse, i could do it
[18:24:54] <Fick> I'm trying to figure out why my JQuery on click event is sending like 20 put requests to my server. The on click event is at the bottom of tournaments.js.coffee in this gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7017825
[18:29:45] <dcope> if i have a selector like $("td.control").click(function... why would it get called twice whenever i click on the td?
[18:48:14] <unnu> anyone know why my checkboxes arn't checking http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/1/
[18:56:18] <DarkGhost> unnu http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/4/ you had alot ofthings wromg
[18:56:19] <DarkGhost> wrong
[19:04:23] <unnu> still has issues darkghost
[19:04:42] <DarkGhost> ?
[19:16:44] <Decalmo> i've got a foreach loop that outputs a form and some other stuff... for each "inventory" item
[19:16:56] <Decalmo> (php foreach loop)
[19:17:29] <Decalmo> I've also got a form inside that loop to update the items quantity
[19:18:25] <Decalmo> im trying to use .nearest to output the results of the form submission, however I'm having trouble figuring out how to target the DIV, since the form and the target for output doesn't sit directly as a child/parent in the DOM
[19:18:29] <Decalmo> im also really new to jQuery
[19:19:35] <jphase> Decalmo: I'd have to see the DOM structure to be sure. Have you tried .closeset?
[19:20:03] <Decalmo> yea, I'm sorta messing it up
[19:20:08] <Decalmo> oh hey jphase!
[19:20:10] <Decalmo> hahah
[19:20:18] <Decalmo> I could show you the dom... lemme clean it up a little bit
[19:25:28] <Decalmo> tried to remove all the superfluous stuff here jphase http://paste.laravel.com/Zxy
[19:26:02] <Decalmo> basically the form is there... submits and successfully updates the database... I'd like for it to afterwards output the result up in that other div
[19:26:02] <jphase> Decalmo: what's the event bound to?
[19:26:08] <Decalmo> form submission
[19:26:15] <Decalmo> keep in mind
[19:26:17] <Decalmo> there are many of these
[19:26:25] <Decalmo> they loop for every inventory item the customer has
[19:27:07] <jphase> so, on form submit you want to figure out the "target div" but I don't know what that means exactly
[19:29:05] <jphase> Decalmo: what are you trying to target and on what event exactly?
[19:32:26] <Decalmo> oh sorry
[19:33:17] <Decalmo> yea basically after the form submits, the backend interactions are all good and whatnot... the result that is retrieved I'd like to output into that <div class="invAmount"> div
[19:33:29] <Decalmo> but if I use .nearest it doesn't seem to bubble up
[19:33:36] <Decalmo> i'd use an ID except I have any number of these things
[19:34:35] <sweave> hi i'm trying to get the current page link to be bolded on http://bobbyvcomposer.com/ .  i've tried a couple of tutorials like http://learnedstuffs.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/jquery-highlighting-the-menu-item-for-the-current-page/ but i can't get it to work.  suggestions welcome
[19:36:33] <yellowfish> yo
[19:43:41] <jphase> yo yo
[19:44:42] <Decalmo> yo
[19:45:02] <jphase> sweave: You'll probably want to just do that with css by adding a class to the active <li> item
[19:45:45] <sweave> hmmm i considered that at first but wont that only work with static sites and i'd have to put in a tag on each body page?
[19:46:17] <sweave> errr each pages <body> i mean
[19:46:58] <yellowfish> is there a way to do two simultaneous animations?
[19:48:39] <jphase> sweave: the correct way is to do this with css and then use a database value (like from a CMS) to change the active classes. The fact that you're working with static .html files is what's making it static. You *could* use the current window location but definitely not with files like "1.html" since there's zero relation to the page you're on
[19:50:45] <jphase> yellowfish: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1251300/how-to-run-two-jquery-animations-simultaneously#4719034
[19:52:56] <jphase> Decalmo: inside your form submit, try    $(this).closest('.row').siblings('.invAmount').children('h2').text(YourValue);
[19:54:44] * Velveeta holds his hands through the ropes and motions to jphase to tag him in!
[19:54:50] <sweave> i'm sorry jphase i'm not sure i understand.  i do plan on using a cms to generate pages.  but everything i've read regarding a css solution seem to indicate i need to put in an id in the body tage of each page which i'm not sure i can do in a css generated page.
[19:55:02] <sweave> i would prefer a css only solution
[19:55:34] <jphase> sweave: no, you'd just check to see if it's the active page (with PHP, or whatever server-side language you're using), then add class="active" to the <li> in your nav that's active
[19:55:37] <sweave> but i'm not sure how that is feasible
[19:55:38] <Velveeta> there's no way for css alone to be aware of what page is being viewed
[19:56:25] <sweave> hmmm i thought that is what my jquery attempt was doing
[19:56:51] <jphase> sweave: you *could* do something ghetto like check the url, strip out .html from "whatever.html" and use jQuery to make a page active based on a text match, but that won't work in many situations without major ghetto code hacks
[19:56:57] <jphase> best to do it on teh server sidez
[19:57:37] <Velveeta> right, because unless you have a page that's named consistently for every single category heading, as well as a separate category for every single page on the site, something like that isn't feasible
[19:57:43] * jphase tags out
[19:57:59] <Velveeta> like if you had multiple blog entires, and a person is viewing any given one of them, you'd probably want 'blog' to be bolded i would assume
[19:58:01] <sweave> as in what i was doing? or as in a css only solution?
[19:58:07] <sweave> yes
[19:58:08] <Velveeta> but you can't name every single blog entry 'blog.html'
[19:58:15] <sweave> definetely
[19:58:27] <Velveeta> so there'd be no way to reference the location and determine the current category to be bolded
[19:58:36] <sweave> okay
[19:58:44] <Velveeta> but on the server, you can say that "for any given blog entry, set 'blog' as the active category"
[19:58:59] <Velveeta> and then just have it add a class like "acitve" to that li
[19:59:16] <Velveeta> what cms are you using for this site anyway?
[19:59:24] <sweave> none at the moment
[19:59:37] <sweave> i will be setting up a wordpress for it
[19:59:41] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:59:44] <jphase> sweave: wordpress does this for you btw
[19:59:47] <sweave> was just trying to get this working before i  did
[19:59:51] <sweave> oh?
[19:59:58] <jphase> sweave: yeah, has it's own class
[20:00:01] <jphase> current_page_item
[20:00:06] <sweave> .... oh
[20:00:07] <jphase> some others too
[20:00:08] <sweave> T__T
[20:00:10] <Velveeta> woo hoo! problem solved :D
[20:00:25] <Velveeta> i don't use headings on my wordpress blog, so i wasn't even aware of that
[20:00:30] <Velveeta> it's just blog post after blog post :D
[20:00:37] <sweave> so it would do that automatically?
[20:00:42] <sweave> i would just have to define in my css
[20:00:48] <sweave> a .current_page_item
[20:00:52] <sweave> set of rules
[20:01:07] <jphase> sweave: yeah, just make your site in WordPress and inspect the <li> items, it's .current_page_item for active pages in the wp_nav_menu, and some others for other things
[20:01:09] <Velveeta> sounds like it, yep
[20:01:21] <jphase> like has classes for category or archive page in the body tag, etc.
[20:01:21] <sweave> oh
[20:01:26] <sweave> i see
[20:01:46] <sweave> four hours wasted T___T
[20:01:48] <jphase> css ftw
[20:01:54] <sweave> thank you both though :)
[20:02:06] <jphase> sure thing
[20:02:09] <Velveeta> gotta love it when that happens
[20:23:36] <relipse> MRX, any luck?
[20:23:48] <relipse> oh he gone
[20:28:04] <sunuslee> hi, how can a "wrap" a javascript onclick callback?
[20:28:46] <sunuslee> i mean, i use a third part liarbary, when i hit a buttom, i want to call my callback first, then the 3-rd part
[20:31:08] <jphase> sunuslee: you could use .pipe for that
[20:33:22] <sunuslee> jphase: what?
[20:33:44] <jphase> sunuslee: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[20:34:18] <Velveeta> i think what he's talking about is changing the execution order of bound event listeners
[20:34:34] <Velveeta> so his 3rd party app is binding a click event before he can, but he wants his own to execute before the 3rd party app
[20:34:35] <jphase> oh
[20:34:49] <Velveeta> so, i've done it before, but it's not a clean method by any means
[20:35:45] <Velveeta> you have to bind your listener, then pull the event data for that element from the jquery cache, then pop your listener off the bottom of that array and unshift it onto the top, and resave that event data
[20:35:55] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  yeah, that's what i mean
[20:36:39] <jphase> could you just pass a function that has the stuff in the .click event to the original callback and call it when appropriate?
[20:37:27] <Velveeta> that would depend on that 3rd party app and what it's set up to take
[20:37:49] <sunuslee> oh, i first get the 'callback function object' from the 3rd part lib, then make my own with my function. then re-bind it to buttom?
[20:38:02] <Velveeta> so, i'll throw this out there, but with the caveat that, like i said, it's not clean, and it's not advised, as it uses what's considered to be a jquery private internal method, which could change at any time
[20:38:21] <Velveeta> let's say your element in question is #myEl
[20:39:47] <Velveeta> you'd do something like this: var $el = $('#myEl').on('click', myHandler), events = $._data($el[0], 'events'); events.unshift(events.pop()); $._data($el[0], 'events', events);
[20:40:12] <jphase> hehe "yoink"
[20:42:38] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  is there a javascript way?
[20:43:01] <Velveeta> you mean a native js way? because jquery methods are javascript...
[20:43:16] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  yeah
[20:43:44] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  right now, i don't have to use jqeury framwork
[20:44:13] <Velveeta> sure, but it would involve manually creating an event listener object, iterating over the jQuery.cache object until you found the proper key by the element's expando property, and doing the same steps
[20:44:22] <Velveeta> it's not a pretty sight
[20:44:30] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  okay, i will try that. thank you very much!
[20:44:36] <Velveeta> is that 3rd party app attaching a native handler or a jquery listener?
[20:52:02] <sunuslee> Velveeta: it's native
[20:52:20] <Velveeta> i don't know that there's a way around it in that case then
[20:53:00] <Velveeta> maybe set a click listener on a child of that element to ensure that it fires first? if that's an option?
[21:03:31] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  that's what i did. it seems to work by using jquery. i am not sure if that right
[21:04:27] <sunuslee> old_cb = $('.selector').click;   $('.selector').click(function() {alert('LOLOL'); old_cb();})
[21:04:37] <sunuslee> that's all. what do you think?
[21:08:27] <Velveeta> "click" itself is a jquery function itself, which dispatches the currently-bound click events, it's not a click event listener itself
[21:10:41] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  yeah, so that i can call it
[21:12:08] <Velveeta> i can see that leading to recursion issues.. you're attaching a click event handler, which itself calls the queue of click event handlers, which includes a handler that calls the queue of click handlers, which contains a handler that calls the queue of click handlers, etc
[21:16:54] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  oh right..
[21:20:51] <sunuslee> Velveeta:  nope, there is NOT recursion issues…
[21:31:14] <ekx> I have a question about web hosting and redirects; can anyone recommend an appropriate channel to ask in?
[21:31:30] <sacho> sunuslee, $(this).click() would achieve the same thing in your snippet.
[21:45:12] <sunuslee> sacho:  what do you mean?
[21:46:44] <sacho> $('.selector').click(function () { alert('LOLOL'); $(this).click(); })
[21:48:04] <sacho> well, okay, not the same thing. Your code actually produces an error.
[21:48:14] <rookie84> hey everyone, I have a few games (jquery based) typing games basically, I want to use Angular for the entire interface
[21:48:17] <sacho> should have figured.
[21:48:30] <rookie84> is that feasible, or I will have to endup rewriting alot of code in angular?
[21:48:34] <rookie84> please advise.
[21:49:08] <Velveeta> yeah, that original code produces an error because it's calling $.fn.click with no scope
[21:49:33] <Velveeta> rookie84: i'm not sure, you might want to ask that in the angular channel
[21:49:48] <rookie84> ok I just found that channel, thankyou Velveeta.
[21:49:54] <Velveeta> no problem
[21:55:40] <zizzz> Hey guys is there a plugin out there for a vertical menu but the sub-menu's on hover open up like jQuery mobile nav opens up, kind of slides out from the left to right??
[22:00:00] <yellowfish> anyone know a simple jquery cookie function?
[22:02:08] <jphase> yellowfish: well you could write your own ajax interface with your server-side code, or you could use a plugin like https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie or something and use $.cookie
[22:02:56] <yellowfish> thanks jphase that's just what I need
[22:03:14] <jphase> np
[22:03:42] <Velveeta> if you're not actually using the cookie server side, but only on the client, you could also look into an app that uses local/sessionstorage where it's available, and falls back to cookie where it's not
[22:04:25] <Velveeta> i guess not sessionstorage for a cookie, but localstorage or indexeddb maybe
[22:12:41] <zizzz> Hey guys is there a plugin out there for a vertical menu but the sub-menu's on hover open up like jQuery mobile nav opens up, kind of slides out from the left to right??
[22:16:14] <__equinox> is it possible to know which AJAX function is called, when I have a site that does an ajax call
[22:18:48] <__equinox> or maybe the question is
[22:18:50] <__equinox> given a class
[22:18:55] <__equinox> is it possible to find the functionName
[22:18:58] <__equinox> that is called
[22:19:03] <__equinox> associated with events on that class
[22:24:59] <jphase> __equinox: you could do something like console.log(​$._data($('.yourClass')[0], 'events')); to get the events bound to that element if that's what you mean?
[22:25:40] <__equinox> jphase: yes, exactly what I needed
[22:25:41] <__equinox> thanks
[22:25:46] <jphase> np
[22:31:33] <lifechamp> Can I just run this in the browser as file:///<path>/client.html http://pastebin.com/hyApY5pA
[22:32:38] <lifechamp> can I change line 18 from "client.html" to "localhost" if I have node.js listening on port 80, and it should work?
[22:33:39] <lifechamp> or to: http://gb-penguin-eu.herokuapp.com/
[22:34:05] <lifechamp> (nothing happens when I run it with the heroku url -- nothing is returned)
[22:34:29] <jphase> lifechamp: do you have errors in your console about cross domain requests or anything?
[22:34:47] <lifechamp> pls remind me where i check those
[22:35:11] <jphase> ctrl + shift + j on windows, cmd + option + j on chrome/mac, or right click and "inspect element" then click "console" tab
[22:35:28] <jphase> windows/linux that is
[22:48:23] <kandinski> if there is some inline JS in a html document, and I'm modifying it in the Firefox inspector, how can I retrigger the code?
[22:57:24] <jphase> kandinski: you can paste it into your console
[23:36:33] <murugaratham> anyone knows what's wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/rp99r/

[23:47:52] <markamodo> Hello, I'd like to create a textarea for IE8 that automatically resizes based on the content put into it. I've attempted to utilize the plugin for this purpose described here: http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize/ but am unable to get this plugin to work.
[23:52:23] <markamodo> Instead, the text areas use the standard textarea scrollbar when additional text exceeds the space. I've attempted to use the demo from the same site to see if I am doing something wrong but the demo html document from the site does not work any better than my code. Would anyone be willing to assist me with creating textareas that expand and contract automatically based on what content is put in them?
[23:53:49] <DRWhite> hi all, anyon eknow anything much about performing POST of a form using AJAX?

[23:56:31] <Cork> markamodo: start by reading what the extension does (read the source)
[23:56:47] <markamodo> Thank you cork. I'll do that now.
[23:56:51] <Cork> that way you would be able to figure out what is expected to happen and what goes wrong
[23:57:29] <Cork> ?ask @ DRWhite
[23:57:29] <b-ot> DRWhite: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:57:37] <markamodo> that makes sense. I may not be able to understand all that it's doing but I'll do my best.
[23:57:49] <DRWhite> I did ask my question
[23:57:59] <Cork> markamodo: well you are welcome to ask for the partial you need help understanding
[23:58:11] <Cork> DRWhite: no you asked for a person not the question
[23:58:22] <DRWhite> I'm tryint to perform one and need ot know how to do it because I can't find a way to do it
[23:58:39] <DRWhite> so I need assistance from someone that has experience in the area
