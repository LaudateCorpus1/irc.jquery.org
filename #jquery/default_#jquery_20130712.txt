[00:13:55] <ezenechea> Hi people… I have a problem loading a custom jquery script on my site. But the error appears only on chrome
[00:14:20] <Lucaszz> elo
[00:15:19] <ezenechea> the site is fiscales.gob.ar
[00:15:37] <ezenechea> it works on all other browsers.
[00:17:34] <shmoon> hello quick'
[00:18:41] <shmoon> I do form.serialize() - gives me a serialized string, how can i get a JS object out of this ?
[00:18:53] <shmoon> or maybe get a JS object instead fo serialized string out of form
[00:19:54] <Lucaszz> http://pastebin.com/yuk6S7im Could you tell me how to export DataGrid class to globals/
[00:21:58] <Gazpacho> ezenechea: why do you have script URLs that start with //
[00:25:39] <ezenechea> Gazpacho: I don't know… Im going to take a look.
[00:25:54] <ezenechea> Gazpacho: like wich
[00:26:09] <ezenechea> Gazpacho:one?
[00:26:21] <Eviltwin_> Gazpacho: When they start with simply // that means they adopt the protocol of the page
[00:26:26] <Eviltwin_> http: vs https:
[00:31:11] <ezenechea> chrome shows an error: VM4127 on line 1
[00:31:52] <ezenechea> it's make no sense to me. Sorry about my english.
[01:14:46] <anew> if i need to click() on two elements, if i use the same id for both.. that will not work?
[01:17:19] <Cork> anew: no
[01:17:26] <Cork> you can't have an id on more then one element
[01:17:37] <Cork> they are uniq and if they exist on two element you have invalid html
[01:18:10] <anew> ok and what if i am getting .val() from two different id's
[01:18:12] <anew> same thing?
[01:18:31] <anew> i.e. can i use a class on two different inputs to get two different val()
[01:18:38] <anew> or do i need to use two different id's
[01:19:50] <Cork> ?.val @ anew
[01:19:51] <anew> yeah nevermind
[01:19:54] <anew> wont work either
[01:20:06] <Cork> anew: .val grabs the value from the first element in the response
[01:20:07] <ramkam2013> hello, i'm looking for an infinite scroll plugin, that can remove top items to avoid overloading the dom
[01:20:19] <anew> i am loading different templates and getting different val() but the var never overwrites itself
[01:20:25] <anew> i keep having the same one hmmm
[01:20:44] <ramkam2013> and reload the items if the scroll is going up instead of down :-)
[01:20:48] <ramkam2013> wonder if it exists
[01:21:12] <Cork> anew: check so you arn't using a global variable
[01:21:43] <anew> yeah thought that was it also
[01:22:07] <anew> but it's not.... u dont have to declare vas inside .click() do you ?
[01:22:11] <anew> var city =
[01:22:15] <anew> or can just write city =
[01:23:19] <ramkam2013> anew: javascript can sometimes be picky. use the var and ; and avoid yourself developpement and maintenance headaches
[01:23:49] <Cork> anew: if it is inside a click or not doesn't matter
[01:23:50] <mrHAT> (function () { var obj = {} }());  obj will not be available outside the anonymous function right ?
[01:24:04] <Cork> anew: if it isn't an argument it should always have a declaration (var)
[01:24:22] <Cork> mrHAT: correct
[01:24:24] <mrHAT> also, when i define a global variable will automatically be attached to the window object right ?
[01:24:54] <Cork> mrHAT: (function() { something = 1; })(); is the same thing as (function() { window.something = 1; })();
[01:24:56] <pkay> hello. is there some way i can trigger a .dialog() anytime i want, without linking it to a specific div or class?
[01:25:09] <ramkam2013> what's the best infini-scroll (both up and downwards)  jq plugin ?
[01:25:28] <anew> i need to fiddle this because i am at a loss here
[01:25:32] <Cork> pkay: you will have to have an element to make into the dialog
[01:25:55] <Cork> pkay: unless your ok with using confirm/alert
[01:27:39] <pkay> Cork: do you have time to look into some lines of code?
[01:27:54] <Cork> pb them and will see
[01:28:01] <Cork> depends on how complex they are
[01:28:37] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/8gAsS/ can anyone please help with this, the user on first div clicks back-select-states, everything works... but when the div appears a second time, the state is still leftover from the first click
[01:28:46] <mrHAT> Cork : i come from oop language like php and don't quite know much about js and how to organize stuff... i started re-doing some of my code and here is what i came up with: http://pastebin.com/aTbjvBui am i on the right track ? i'm defining objects for each of my modules and set methods and properties which i later access really easy...
[01:28:48] <anew> i dont even know if u can figure this out from what i have pasted gd damnit
[01:29:03] <pkay> i'll link you directly, then you'll see it in action - biblefindr.com - search for anything, say "job" . then view the source. i'm trying to replace the popup at line 28 with a jquery dialog
[01:29:14] <Cork> wow question overload :D
[01:29:22] <anew> user sees list of cities - clicks back and sees list of states
[01:29:46] <anew> clicks state - sees list of cities , but if the user now clicks back again the state which is saved is still from the first click
[01:29:48] <anew> i dont knwo why
[01:30:18] <anew> gah kill me
[01:30:42] <mrHAT> Cork : what i don't know is how is 'navActions' object handled... loads everything into the memory @ runtime ?.. i have no ideea
[01:30:42] <Cork> anew: $('[id="state-select-new"]').length
[01:31:10] <anew> 1
[01:31:29] <Cork> anew: and $('[id="state-select-new2"]').length
[01:32:11] <anew> 1
[01:32:18] <Cork> anew: but ya you would have to start debugging the code
[01:32:24] <anew> damnit
[01:32:30] <Cork> can't really tell whats going wrong there
[01:32:41] <anew> yeah figured
[01:32:43] <Cork> you have a little to many dependencies there
[01:32:48] <anew> it's to screwed up already
[01:33:22] <Cork> mrHAT: yes, that is how it works
[01:33:39] <mrHAT> i should keep that code style ?
[01:33:48] <mrHAT> is the best way to do it ?
[01:34:35] <Cork> pkay: add an <div id="popup" style="display: none"></div> at the end of the page
[01:34:47] <bso> hi
[01:35:00] <Cork> pkay: then just do $('#popup').html(event.target.innerHTML).dialog('show')
[01:35:15] <bso> I have some problem with jquery mobile is it the correct chan here ?
[01:35:22] <Cork> yes
[01:35:36] <Cork> you might have to wait for a response though
[01:35:45] <bso> Cork: ok thanks
[01:36:06] <bso> I would like have the panel open on page load
[01:36:26] <bso> is it possible ?
[01:36:30] <anew> cork how would you clear a variable ? var city = undefined;
[01:36:30] <anew> ?
[01:36:42] <Cork> anew: ya
[01:36:49] <Cork> without the var though
[01:37:21] <Cork> if it needs to be cleared, it should mean it is defined, so don't double define it
[01:38:00] <mrHAT> Cork: have you looked over my code ?
[01:38:32] <Cork> mrHAT: not more then answering your question
[01:38:39] <Cork> was there something more you wanted to ask?
[01:39:26] <mrHAT> yeah... i do all ajax requests using $_post and return a json string from the server
[01:39:37] <mrHAT> how is that parsed by $_post
[01:39:41] <mrHAT> array ?
[01:39:47] <mrHAT> object ?
[01:40:23] <Cork> mrHAT: well it depends on what the server sends
[01:40:25] <mrHAT> i currently access as data['jsonproperty'] but i dont know exactly what data is
[01:40:29] <Cork> json is both objects and arrays
[01:40:40] <mrHAT> ah yes
[01:40:46] <Cork> data is the name of the first argument to the function
[01:40:51] <Cork> function (data) {
[01:40:53] <vshjxyz> The success callback function is passed the returned data, which will be an XML root element or a text string depending on the MIME type of the response. It is also passed the text status of the response.
[01:40:59] <mrHAT> yes
[01:41:02] <vshjxyz> which means that it depends on the mimetype
[01:41:31] <Cork> well it can be a parsed object too
[01:41:31] <mrHAT> i'm not sending any mimetype on the server
[01:41:35] <vshjxyz> if the server sends a application/json
[01:41:39] <Cork> if you send json the mimetype should be just that
[01:41:47] <mrHAT> i guess it sends text
[01:41:51] <mrHAT> i dont specify anything
[01:42:16] <Cork> mrHAT: <?php header('content-Type: application/json'); ?>
[01:42:17] <vshjxyz> just debug and see ;) if you get text instead of json you can either force the $post to parse json or parse it by hand
[01:42:17] <mrHAT> don't know what it defaults to
[01:42:33] <Cork> mrHAT: text/html is the default for php (if that is what your using)
[01:42:45] <mrHAT> i dont want to rely on the server for that and this is why i needed to know what $_post will do
[01:42:46] <vshjxyz> The type of data expected from the server. Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, text, html).
[01:42:59] <Cork> mrHAT: you have to depend on the server
[01:43:07] <mrHAT> hmm
[01:43:10] <Cork> mrHAT: cause it is up to the server to tell the client what it sends
[01:43:12] <mrHAT> ok
[01:43:14] <Cork> if the server lies...
[01:43:21] <Cork> well the server lies
[01:43:28] <mrHAT> you are right
[01:43:30] <mrHAT> ok
[01:43:41] <mrHAT> so if i send application/json
[01:43:51] <mrHAT> what is a safe way to access the object
[01:43:54] <mrHAT> data.prop ?
[01:44:00] <mrHAT> data['prop']
[01:44:03] <mrHAT> would both work ?
[01:44:10] <vshjxyz> I think that jquery will guess if it's a json even if you send the wrong mimetype, so you'll probably have no issues at all
[01:44:13] <pkay> Cork: thanks, letme try it
[01:44:16] <Cork> data[] if it is an array data.key or data['key']
[01:44:21] <Cork> if it is an object
[01:44:35] <Cork> vshjxyz: no it won't
[01:44:38] <mrHAT> ok
[01:44:40] <mrHAT> yes
[01:45:02] <mrHAT> what if a property im accesing is undefined
[01:45:05] <Cork> vshjxyz: if you don't set the mimetype the client will take it as string
[01:45:05] <anew> $('#state-select-new').val() = null; ok this is not valid, how would i make the val() of this id empty then ?
[01:45:09] <mrHAT> what is a safe way to check againts that
[01:45:13] <Cork> mrHAT: it means it doesn't exist
[01:45:19] <mrHAT> if(data.prop === undefined) ?
[01:45:21] <Cork> mrHAT: console.log(data)
[01:45:25] <Cork> mrHAT: yes
[01:45:26] <vshjxyz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5787548/how-does-jquery-guess-the-better-datatype-in-ajax-method
[01:45:32] <mrHAT> ok
[01:45:38] <mrHAT> i got everything clear now
[01:45:39] <mrHAT> :)
[01:45:42] <vshjxyz> you're right ;) i was saying that because of the "intelligent guess" phrase
[01:45:50] <mrHAT> alltrough i would need to do some reading
[01:45:55] <titii> hi, is there a possible to make an event on change the content of the input field? i tried this $('.classicBasketItem .edit input.tel').on('keyup, change, paste'... but dont work
[01:46:24] <mrHAT> i was doing js difrently until now and always thought it would take me little time to learn everything
[01:46:25] <byungsin>  titii: there's always $( some obj). change ( )
[01:46:29] <mrHAT> it seams is vast terrain
[01:46:32] <Cork> titii: make an event on change the content?
[01:46:41] <byungsin>  mrHAT
[01:46:44] <titii> Cork: Yes
[01:46:55] <Cork> titii: that doens't really make sense
[01:47:09] <byungsin> try to use things like chrome dev tools
[01:47:11] <titii> byungsin: yes, but that event appear after focus out
[01:47:44] <byungsin>  @ titii : didn't know that
[01:48:04] <Cork> titii: so what is it your trying to do?
[01:48:17] <byungsin>  @titii  but doesn't IE have something like beforeChange event?
[01:48:29] <mrHAT> thanks Cork as always best helper here
[01:48:44] <anew> cork how can i set $('#state-select-new').val() = null; so the <input> now has no value ?
[01:48:58] <Cork> anew: .val('')
[01:49:10] <Cork> it can't be null
[01:49:21] <Cork> but it can be an empty string
[01:49:31] <titii> Cork: I have a input field with spinner plugin, that can in/de crease the value by the arrows up/down, other option is to change it be your self
[01:49:35] <seutje> you can't be null!
[01:49:56] <titii> Cork: after this i need to update some statistics of the value
[01:51:05] <titii> Cork: i tried this, but dont work the keyup, dont know why? - $('.classicBasketItem .edit input.tel').on('keyup, change, paste', function() {
[01:51:28] <Cork> titii: remove the comma
[01:51:30] <Cork> +s
[01:53:01] <titii> Cork: ah, thanks, but these events dont work by clicking on the arrows, hmmm..
[01:53:30] <Cork> titii: that would only work if the plugin generated fake events
[01:53:44] <Cork> you might have to register a click handler for the arrows
[01:55:21] <titii> Cork, ok, but how to bind the click event on .arrow-up, .arrow-down to this sentese? $('.classicBasketItem .edit input.tel').on('keyup change paste', function() { ?
[01:55:27] <Glyph1> has anybody here ever used the jquery selectbox plugin?
[01:55:36] <titii> Cork: to the some function, u know
[01:55:45] <Cork> titii: you prob need to make a separate selector
[01:55:59] <Glyph1> it only seems to work on the first selectbox
[01:56:23] <Cork> Glyph1: if you could make a fiddle of your problem it would help (and no i haven't used the plugin)
[01:56:25] <Cork> ?p
[01:56:34] <Cork> sigh... the bots are down >_<
[01:56:37] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[01:57:03] <titii> Cork: ok, but i would'nt like to have a duplicit content of a function
[01:57:23] <Cork> titii: you could use a named function and just assign it on both places
[01:58:19] <titii> Cork: ahm really? OK, I cant bind two selectors with one functionality<
[01:58:46] <Cork> you can but you can't separate the different event listeners
[01:59:17] <Cork> and as you want to do $('elm1').on('keyup change paste', func); $('elm2').on('click', func)
[01:59:19] <titii> Cork: mmt, i have an idea. Yes, but maybe i cant have the all events on both :) I try it
[01:59:23] <Cork> it is better to have it as two calls
[01:59:58] <titii> I mean I can
[02:00:01] <titii> srry
[02:00:05] <titii> k, thank u
[02:02:38] <pkay> Cork: any idea why the window.open popup is being blocked in my code?
[02:02:59] <pkay> Cork: even though it's only triggered after the user clicks
[02:03:00] <Cork> pkay: do you have the link again?
[02:03:18] <pkay> biblefindr.com - type something to search then view the source - line 28
[02:03:39] <pkay> Cork: search for jobab, and click on jobab
[02:03:47] <Cork> pkay: it is triggered from an ajax call
[02:03:59] <Cork> so you lose the user interaction event
[02:04:14] <pkay> ah, any work-around for this?
[02:04:25] <bso> I would like have the panel open on page load in jquery mobile, is it possible and how ?
[02:04:47] <Cork> make the call through window.popup
[02:04:52] <Cork> opps
[02:05:01] <Cork> window.open, instead of $.ajax
[02:05:17] <Cork> though that means you would have to lose eastoncheck.php
[02:05:46] <Cork> pkay: or make the resulting inline (jquery dialog for example)
[02:09:15] <anew> cork it seems i cant reuse a template... once i .html the template, it cant be put back into <script> tags so i can put new data into it
[02:09:40] <Cork> anew: uh what?
[02:09:47] <anew> lol
[02:09:49] <anew> will pastebin
[02:09:53] <Cork> what does <script> have to do with .html ?
[02:10:04] <anew> will show u
[02:10:40] <anew> http://pastebin.com/HmcxXrWy
[02:10:47] <Cork> hmm i think i know what your going to show me...
[02:11:10] <anew> so bah i copied the wrong id, but just pretend id="state-date" at the top
[02:11:32] <anew> so i render this template inside <script> tags... the problem is, if i want to re-render it... i cant because it doesnt exist anymore
[02:12:08] <Cork> anew: try wrap the content in the script tag in cdata blocks
[02:12:29] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA
[02:12:30] <anew> cdata blocks? trying to google that
[02:12:51] <Cork> not sure if that will make a difference
[02:13:08] <anew> ok, i guess i cannot use templating like this if i want to reuse them, i have to put it specifically in the js
[02:13:13] <Cork> but if you grab the content of the script tag, it shouldn't modify the original
[02:13:15] <arex\> Has anyone been successful in embedding jQuery as base64 data in an HTML document?
[02:13:42] <Cork> arex\: that would be quite a bit of overhead
[02:14:02] <Cork> but it should be possible i guess
[02:15:59] <arex\> it would be nice to have no dependencies :)
[02:16:17] <arex\> it is for a generated report, nothing performance critical
[02:16:37] <Cork> arex\: but the jquery lib would grow in size by ~ 60%
[02:16:53] <arex\> i don't see the problem with that :)
[02:17:00] <Cork> and you would have to pay that cost for evey page load
[02:17:06] <Cork> as it can't be cached
[02:17:19] <Cork> instead of just loading it once and then reuse it
[02:17:22] <arex\> yeah, the page won't be reloaded, as i said it is for a single page report
[02:17:29] <seutje> lol
[02:17:48] <Cork> arex\: why do you need jquery at all?
[02:17:52] <seutje> most ppl would already have a CDN version cached and ready to go
[02:18:01] <Cork> might just be simpler to write it natively
[02:18:06] <Cork> ya
[02:18:41] <arex\> oh well
[02:18:44] <arex\> i'll figure it out
[02:19:43] <anew> cork think i almost have it... http://pastebin.com/jSsmHEU7 how can i write this inside this variable?  i think the each is screwing it up ?
[02:20:33] <Cork> anew: this inside this?
[02:20:46] <Cork> anew: you mean the 0 part?
[02:22:29] <anew> i mean something is wrong with this syntax i dont knwo what
[02:22:48] <anew> i am trying to put it all inside tableTemplate so on the next line i can .html(_.tample(tableTemplate,...
[02:23:18] <Cork> anew: you should prob use item instead of items[0]
[02:29:59] <sokmar> hi, can anyone recommend a solid plugin for temporarily suspending an event firing on an element (click in particular), one that handles corner cases?
[02:33:55] <Iszak> sokmar why not just unbind it..?
[02:35:15] <sokmar> Iszak: abstraction, I don't want the code that does the suspension to know anything about the click handlers that are actually bound
[02:36:03] <Iszak> well it must know about the click handlers to re-bind it.
[02:37:15] <Iszak> You could have an abstract layer on all events that checks if that element events is frozen but that'll add significant overhead (but you're using jquery, so you probably don't care). The other alternative is to have a manager that unbinds and rebinds it, but for that to work, it needs to know what to rebind - it doesn't have to be hard coded.
[02:37:44] <Iszak> The second case would take all of an hour to write with unit tests.
[02:37:48] <Palani> Hi Guys can any one help me out....
[02:38:00] <Iszak> ?ask @ Palani
[02:38:00] <b-ot> Palani: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:38:26] <Eviltwin> Well you could give him a chance to finish his sentence first
[02:38:50] <sokmar> Iszak: first case sounds very intrusive, and I'm looking for an existing implementation so I didn't have to maintain it :P
[02:39:09] <Iszak> sokmar good choice but to be honest, some jquery plugins seem hit and miss.
[02:39:54] <Iszak> Eviltwin would you not agree that it's best to have a question on one message as opposed to strung out on 4 or 5?
[02:39:57] <Palani> I have a 2 diff time ranges like ( 08:00 AM - 05:00 PM) && (02:00 PM-04:00 PM)....I need to get those two hours our conflicts.....How to achieve that
[02:40:20] <Iszak> That is not a jquery specific question, but I will tell you, you're probably better off using a library.
[02:40:22] <Palani> I have a 2 diff time ranges like ( 08:00 AM - 05:00 PM) && (02:00 PM-04:00 PM)....I need to get those two hours  conflicts.....How to achieve that
[02:40:48] <Iszak> what I would do is normalize the times into 24 hour time and then use simple if statements to check if they're within range.
[02:40:50] <Eviltwin> Palani: This is not something jQuery will assist you with
[02:41:00] <sokmar> sigh, I'll just sidestep the issue completely, thanks anyway
[02:41:08] <Iszak> Eviltwin there's probably a jquery plugin for you, trololol.
[02:41:31] <Palani> @Eviltwin,,,,Yeap but I am asking there is any Jquery API is there?
[02:41:54] <Iszak> Palani no, not native to jQuery, there may be a plugin, but there is no need for it to be a plugin.
[02:41:58] <Eviltwin> There is no jQuery API that will assist you
[02:42:10] <Iszak> Palani perhaps have a look at moment.js
[02:42:33] <Palani> Ok fine
[02:43:33] <titii> Want ask, this slector cant select some parent of this object? Like: $(this).parent('.edit')?
[02:45:38] <Iszak> titii it depends of what "this" is.
[02:46:07] <titii> Iszak some child element
[02:47:01] <Iszak> titii yes you can.
[02:47:08] <dersiedler1> hi i have a question about the _on delegation. you can do delegation by using e.g a class name in the key of the map. how can i delegate to something like ".list a"?
[02:47:51] <Iszak> dersiedler1 simply by specifying as you did.
[02:48:01] <titii> I need something like this: html: <class=p1..<class=p2..<class=p3, jquery: $(this).parent('.p1'), where this is p3
[02:48:14] <dersiedler1> you think of: this._on(this.element, {                 'click .linklist a' :
[02:48:23] <dersiedler1> this doesn't work
[02:48:34] <Iszak> titii in which case parent will not work, parent simply gets the immediate parent which matches the selector. See ?closest @ titii
[02:48:35] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:48:58] <Iszak> dersiedler1 I've never seen that before, what is that from?
[02:49:23] <dersiedler1> it's an event handler i want to try to bind to a list with some a-tags in it
[02:49:41] <Iszak> I've only seen on() not _on()
[02:49:49] <dersiedler1> but the deleagtion doesn't work as expected
[02:50:05] <Iszak> is this backbone by any chance?
[02:50:19] <titii> Iszak: yes, thats it! thank u vvery much
[02:50:33] <dersiedler1> no it's form the jquery widget factoy @see: http://api.jqueryui.com/1.9/jQuery.widget/#method-_on
[02:50:45] <Iszak> jquery.. ui widget factory.
[02:50:55] <Iszak> Perhaps they would be able to better serve you.
[02:51:33] <dersiedler1> what's the chan for ui? #jquery-ui?
[02:52:04] <Cork> dersiedler1: this one
[02:53:02] <Iszak> I thought jQuery UI had it's own channel.
[02:53:04] <Iszak> #jqueryui
[02:53:17] <Cork> it was merged quite a bit back
[02:53:25] <Iszak> oh man I'm so out of it these days.
[02:53:31] <dersiedler1> hehe
[02:54:13] <dersiedler1> so no ideas about this issue at this time :)
[02:54:34] <Cork> dersiedler1: what was the question?
[02:54:49] <dersiedler1>  you can do delegation by using e.g a class name in the key of the map. how can i delegate to something like ".list a"?
[02:55:16] <dersiedler1> i tried this._on(this.element, {                 'click .linklist a'  but this doesn't work
[02:55:43] <Cork> dersiedler1: are you developing your own plugin or something?
[02:55:56] <dersiedler1> an own widget created via the widget factory
[02:56:06] <Iszak> dersiedler1 it should work see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L406
[02:56:11] <Cork> and what do you want to bind the event on?
[02:56:20] <Cork> the outer most element of the widget?
[02:56:37] <Iszak> ?eval 'click .linklist a'.match(/^(\w+)\s*(.*)$/)
[02:56:40] <bot-t> Iszak: ["click .linklist a", "click", ".linklist a"]
[02:56:43] <Iszak> see ^
[02:57:17] <dersiedler1> this.element i think it's assigned during widget creation.
[02:57:49] <Cork> it is
[02:58:08] <Iszak> dersiedler1 can you paste the whole code with the handler?
[02:58:15] <Iszak> what version of jquery ui are you using?
[02:59:12] <dersiedler1> this._on(this.element, {                 'click .linklist a' : function() {                     console.log('test');                     return false;                 }             });
[02:59:38] <dersiedler1> i'm using 1.9.0
[03:00:07] <dersiedler1> ah no 1.9.2
[03:00:13] <dersiedler1> of jquery-ui
[03:00:47] <Cork> dersiedler1: this._on('click .linklist a', function() {}) should work you don't need this.element
[03:01:06] <Iszak> well I can tell you it's not to do with the selector, look elsewhere.
[03:01:35] <Cork> and ya, the selector/event combo is valid
[03:03:33] <dersiedler1> ok so the selector is correct . hmm will try a little bit more.
[03:04:10] <dersiedler1> Cork the code from you doesn't work so far in my app. maybe it's something else. thanks for your help :)
[03:04:10] <Iszak> dersiedler1 could anything prevent the event from bubbling?
[03:04:48] <dersiedler1> no i have not prevent the bubbling
[03:06:08] <dersiedler1> the only thing is that the a-tags in the list will be created dynamically
[03:06:43] <dersiedler1> that's why i bind to this.element and delegate from there
[03:08:35] <emka> Hi, I have an iframe on facebook and trying to scroll main window to top with this code window.top.$("body, html").animate({scrollTop:0}, 'slow');
[03:08:47] <emka> but getting this error
[03:08:48] <emka> Error: Permission denied to access property '$'
[03:08:53] <emka> from the iframe
[03:09:04] <emka> any ideas how to solve?
[03:09:16] <emka> or if it is even possible
[03:10:50] <Cork> emka: if the main page is from a different domain; you don't have access to it
[03:11:03] <emka> and it is
[03:11:04] <emka> ok
[03:20:34] <Ulrar> Hi, using jQuery mobile I have a checkbox, and a label for="the_checkbox". It is modified by jQuery I guess to look mobile, and on desktop chrome with a iPhone user agent it works fine. But on my real android phone, that checkbox toggles between a home icon and a magnigying glass icon
[03:20:41] <Ulrar> Any idea what could cause that ?
[03:20:57] <Ulrar> Is there a way at least to remove the icons ?
[03:30:36] <spobat> any idea why I can't merge all those vendor files into a single js file?
[03:30:36] <spobat> http://ideone.com/nTVyot
[03:30:49] <spobat> I did 'cat' them on the terminal
[03:31:24] <spobat> are there maybe name conflicts?
[03:31:28] <Cork> spobat: cause your merging html into a script?
[03:31:37] <spobat> Cork: what?
[03:31:43] <Cork> you need to merge the content of the scripts, not the script tags
[03:31:49] <spobat> i did
[03:31:58] <Cork> syntax error near unexpected token `<'
[03:32:07] <Cork> that sounds like it doesn't
[03:32:09] <spobat> I get a bunch of $ not defined
[03:32:33] <Cork> then could you provide the real errors?
[03:32:35] <spobat> Cork: it tried to compile this stuff as "bash"
[03:32:50] <spobat> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ! vendor.js:13
[03:32:50] <spobat> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[03:33:06] <Cork> spobat: then verify that you merge them in the correct order
[03:33:16] <spobat> done :)
[03:33:24] <Cork> and no parser errors?
[03:33:36] <spobat> I did already
[03:33:44] <spobat> jquery comes first
[03:33:52] <Cork> then again, you need to provide the real data
[03:34:05] <BulleTTime> hey guys, i have a accordeon, but can i close 1
[03:34:17] <BulleTTime> without it goes on display:none ?
[03:37:30] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/NTEA2/ here the json is correct, on ajax the template renders and populates correctly.  if the user clicks the button twice however, it does not re-render, it just stays with the data from the first ajax call.  however the json is updated correctly ( so server side i'm correct)
[03:39:06] <mrHAT> $.post().always( function() {  this will execute even if request has failed for whatever reason?  }); ).fail(....
[03:40:59] <Cork> mrHAT: yes
[03:41:09] <Cork> always is the same as the old complete
[03:41:17] <mrHAT> ahh ok
[03:41:47] <anew> cork any ideas on that, i tried writing it different ways
[03:42:18] <Cork> anew: like i said, debug the code, and inspect what's in the different variables
[03:42:20] <anew> but it's still the same problem, the user clicks the second time and i get cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[03:42:25] <BulleTTime> hi anyone knows is it able to not hide the content divs of accordeon?
[03:42:30] <anew> the json is being returned properly cork
[03:42:36] <anew> the variables are changing
[03:42:44] <anew> but just populating the template i have no idea why it's not
[03:42:44] <Cork> anew: there is more variables in there
[03:42:58] <anew> where ?
[03:43:39] <Cork> uh... tableTemplate?
[03:43:44] <Cork> its a global variable
[03:44:12] <Cork> so make sure you don't have something coherency messing around with you
[03:44:21] <anew> wut, how tho, it's inside the ajax call
[03:44:29] <Cork> no its not
[03:44:33] <Cork> its a global variable
[03:44:49] <Cork> tableTemplate isn't defined, so it is auto defined as a global variable
[03:44:54] <anew> oh
[03:44:58] <anew> hmmm
[03:45:06] <anew> so before that line i have to write var tableTemplate = {};
[03:45:13] <Cork> no
[03:45:23] <Cork> just var tableTemplate = "...
[03:45:39] <anew> ah yeah i had that before, wasnt working either, let me try it again tho
[03:45:41] <Cork> or just pass the string directly to _.template(
[03:46:12] <anew> let me try that
[03:49:22] <anew> no, still the old variables...man
[03:49:30] <anew> i'm ready to trash it all and just do it in php
[03:49:41] <Cork> then again, you need to debug the code
[03:50:03] <Cork> dead code dump can't really debugged for this kind of problems
[03:50:10] <Cork> *really be debugged
[03:50:20] <anew> i console.log as much as i could
[03:50:24] <anew> maybe it's an underscore problem
[03:53:07] <mrHAT> Cork there is one thing i still don't have clear with data returned from server on an ajax request. i am doing  $.post(...),"json" and the url im posting to returns content type application/json header along with a json formatted string. I then access returned data like: data.somevar and data.somearr['somehthing'] and $.each(data.somearr.... but i've seen people doing a $.parseJSON on the
[03:53:08] <mrHAT> returned data before accesing the returned object? array?.. why ?
[03:53:50] <Cork> mrHAT: cause they don't configure the server correctly
[03:54:06] <Cork> so the server says it returns html, so jquery just returns it
[03:54:14] <mrHAT> ajj
[03:54:20] <Cork> so they have to manually convert the text to data
[03:54:30] <mrHAT> so the correct way to do this is setting the content type on the server
[03:54:33] <Cork> yes
[03:54:36] <mrHAT> and just rely on that
[03:54:44] <Cork> cause saying you return html when you actually return json is wrong
[03:54:50] <mrHAT> heh
[03:54:51] <mrHAT> right
[03:55:21] <Cork> like some server saying they send text/html when they actually send image/png
[03:55:40] <Cork> and then the admin ppl say "ya, but it is a .png file"
[03:56:03] <mrHAT> heh
[03:56:09] <Cork> if the server says its text/html it is an html file, no matter what the url ends with
[03:57:27] <Cork> this is especially true for php files, as then the server can't know what the data it returns is, so the script should always make sure to set this correctly
[03:57:39] <Cork> (or any type of server script format)
[03:58:58] <mrHAT> i'm using php json_encode(array(...)) and return that.. now i need to find out how reliable is json_encode :) and if strictly respects json format
[03:59:10] <mrHAT> like quoting
[03:59:15] <mrHAT> ...
[03:59:18] <Cork> json_encode is reliably
[03:59:22] <Cork> *reliable
[03:59:51] <Cork> it is intact the only way you should return json
[04:00:03] <mrHAT> i did some manual json but i switch to json_encode
[04:00:17] <Cork> uh sorry *infact
[04:00:19] <mrHAT> i know it was stupid the old way but then i thought it was ok..
[04:00:33] <mrHAT> *back then
[04:00:40] <Cork> it is very easy to miss escaping if you do it your self
[04:00:47] <mrHAT> yeah
[04:05:32] <anew> ok i might be the biggest idiot ever
[04:05:35] <anew> unconfirmed yet
[04:05:37] <anew> let me try something
[04:06:20] <sathish_> this is a question on Noty notification plugin
[04:06:47] <sathish_> Not sure why the following fiddles are working only in Mozilla, they are not  working inside chrome and IE.  http://jsfiddle.net/FPQQp/1/         http://jsfiddle.net/FPQQp/
[04:09:03] <Cork> sathish_: you can't load scripts from raw.github
[04:09:22] <Cork> sathish_: it will be the wrong content type and some browsers will block it
[04:09:54] <Cork> also http://needim.github.io/js/noty/jquery.noty.js doesn't exist
[04:10:02] <sathish_> ok I will try to use a CDN and try again
[04:10:11] <sathish_> but we were having a similar problem in our project
[04:10:28] <sathish_> I will check this quickly and get back
[04:17:18] <mrHAT> Cork i know this is basic stuff.. but how do you properly redirect to the current url
[04:17:35] <Cork> redirect to current?
[04:17:46] <Cork> you mean reload the current page?
[04:17:53] <sathish_> cork, you are right. It worked with CDN. But I still have the issue of it working in one page and not in another page. I think I have to just find the differences between the pages and figure out the problem
[04:17:59] <adsdas> im directed connected to page
[04:18:06] <mrHAT> Cork yes
[04:18:13] <Cork> mrHAT: window.location.reload()
[04:18:22] <sathish_> the error in this page is http://jsfiddle.net/cAsgK/
[04:18:39] <sathish_> Please ignore my previous message
[04:45:01] <mrHAT> Cork where to i see the output of console.log('message test');
[04:45:07] <mrHAT> i'm using firefox
[04:45:25] <Cork> ctrl+shift+k
[04:45:28] <mrHAT> and console shows nothing
[04:45:46] <mrHAT> ahh sorry
[04:45:55] <mrHAT> take that back :)
[04:52:44] <Palani> How to compare and get the common values from two diff array....For exp.. var a = ["a","b","c"]; var b = ["b","d","e"]....C has to return as var c = ["b"];
[05:08:24] <fixxxermet> wc
[05:29:23] <MrFox_> Palani: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-array-intersection-or-union
[05:38:29] <mrHAT> Cork so i have this http://pastebin.com/es64tzD8 that i'm posting trough ajax but of course i get the properties only .. is there anyway i can post the values without modifiying that object prop ? and set ... selector.val() ?
[05:48:19] <fsdf> I am getting only the first hidden value from many dynamic hidden fields looped over.  var group = $('input[type=hidden]').val();  full code http://www.bpaste.net/show/0ufiAgrTcW1nJOsMkXvJ/
[05:48:29] <fsdf> what might be the issue?
[05:48:53] <darkstar|> where would the best place be to start off with ajax, i've got some background with javascript and jquery?
[05:48:59] <fsdf> i want for rows>1
[05:49:11] <fsdf> thats why gt:0
[05:50:14] <darkstar|> ?
[05:50:49] <fsdf> I mean this $('#tableid tr:gt(0)').each(function() });
[05:51:09] <fsdf> oops
[06:14:45] <RabSimpson> hi folks, is it possible to render a submit button unclickable until a certain form field has a value which isn't blank?
[06:15:19] <Cork> RabSimpson: prop('disabled', true)
[06:15:35] <RabSimpson> brilliant, thanks cork :)
[06:15:37] <Cork> you could have to manually test if the field is what you want it to be
[06:15:49] <RabSimpson> i'll give it a go
[06:20:26] <Krambiorix> hi, is there anyone here that uses jquery's autocomplete?
[06:20:40] <Cork> Krambiorix: just ask the question
[06:23:27] <Krambiorix> to format the layout of the autocomplete i use $( "#mykoppelingen" ).data("ui-autocomplete")._renderItem( .... this works perfect, but i have multiple fields where i want to use autocomplete. The first one shows the right format, the second one shows the format of the first one....how can i override it?
[06:23:41] <Krambiorix> so the second time, the renderItem is not invoked
[06:24:26] <Cork> Krambiorix: you would have to bind them separately
[06:26:08] <Krambiorix> Cork, i do that (in 2 separate functions)
[06:26:32] <Cork> Krambiorix: it should work just fine then
[06:27:54] <Krambiorix> Cork, the first bind is $( "#mytags" ).data("ui-autocomplete")._renderItem ... the second one $( "#mykoppelingen" ).data("ui-autocomplete")._renderItem...
[06:28:25] <Cork> Krambiorix: jsfiddle.net
[06:40:58] <jita> In login and signup modals http://hypedsound.cloudshuffle.com/ I am unable to set focus on input using 'tab' key in google chrome, it scrolls to the bottom of the page instead. In safari, IE, it seems to work fine. Any idea ?
[06:43:08] <Cork> jita: that server is seriously slow at loading...
[06:43:41] <jita> Cork, yes :(
[06:45:06] <Cork> ... still loading...
[06:45:37] <Cork> ok, jita you would have to fix that server first
[06:45:55] <Cork> 2mins loading the initial page is more then i'm prepared to wate
[06:45:58] <Cork> *wait
[06:46:14] <jita> Cork, really? It opens for me instantly
[06:48:39] <Krambiorix> Cork, i tried to set up the jsfiddle, but can't make it to work ... http://jsfiddle.net/mWHPV/
[06:49:42] <Cork> Krambiorix: line 3 isn't valid
[06:49:50] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/mWHPV/2/
[06:51:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/mWHPV/5/
[06:51:16] <Cork> only thing left missing is the "tagit" plugin
[06:54:23] <Krambiorix> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/mWHPV/8/
[06:55:28] <RabSimpson> cork, got it working and with a nice bit of custom css too :)
[07:00:34] <Cork> Krambiorix: _renderItem should be extended on $(elm).data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem, not $.ui.autocompete
[07:01:02] <Krambiorix> Cork, i tried that already...
[07:01:14] <Cork> though i can't get your code to work
[07:02:07] <Krambiorix> Cork, yeah, me neither
[07:02:13] <Krambiorix> on my computer it works
[07:02:34] <catmando> hey all
[07:03:04] <Krambiorix> Cork, so it should be $( "#mykoppelingen" ).autocomplete.prototype._renderItem   in this case, right?
[07:03:17] <Cork> not prototype
[07:03:19] <Cork> read again
[07:03:36] <catmando> if anyone can help: why can i set an input's prop('files') in Chrome but not FF?
[07:03:41] <Krambiorix> Cork, sry, yeah, bit too tired today
[07:03:47] <Krambiorix> and we're friday!!
[07:03:47] <catmando> specifically
[07:04:17] <catmando> take this simple fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qMmPr/
[07:04:28] <catmando> it works in Chrome, but FF will not play nicey
[07:04:31] <catmando> any ideas?
[07:05:42] <Krambiorix> Cork, no difference
[07:06:13] <Krambiorix> the _renderItem is not invoked
[07:07:44] <catmando> nobody?
[07:10:31] <Cork> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/mWHPV/9/
[07:10:44] <Cork> catmando: don't be in such a rush
[07:10:54] <Cork> just wait for someone to look at it
[07:11:19] <catmando> sorry, bit tired and craky
[07:11:34] <Krambiorix> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/mWHPV/10/
[07:11:36] * catmando hands Cork a cookie to apologise
[07:11:57] <Krambiorix> Cork, in slider2  i added <b>  and now it doesn't work anymore
[07:12:15] <Krambiorix> ow wait, it does
[07:12:29] <Cork> works fine here
[07:15:44] <Krambiorix> Cork, solved using your fiddle!!! I had to put the autocomplete on the input field and not on the ul
[07:15:52] <Cork> catmando: works fine here
[07:16:21] <Krambiorix> Cork, thank you so much!!
[07:16:47] <Cork> catmando: what version of firefox are you testing in?
[07:17:03] <Cork> some of these file things are very new
[07:18:27] <Cork> hmm  wait no...
[07:19:38] <anew> var click = $('body').on('click', '.state-selects', function(e){...}); can i store all this in var click? doesnt seem to work ?
[07:19:58] <Cork> anew: no click will be a reverence to body
[07:20:14] <anew> how can i store all this into a var so i can call it later ?
[07:20:23] <anew> so i dont have to copy paste like 30 lines of code ?
[07:20:40] <Cork> you can't
[07:20:56] <Cork> you can trigger it though $('elm').click()
[07:21:06] <ajpiano> anew: or just name the function
[07:21:07] <Cork> or you would have to use a named function
[07:21:21] <anew> ah
[07:21:23] <anew> named function
[07:21:24] <anew> yes
[07:21:54] <anew> var function = function() { $()... }
[07:21:55] <anew> right ?
[07:22:08] <ajpiano> almost
[07:22:11] <anew> no
[07:22:13] <ajpiano> you don't put $() inside
[07:22:18] <anew> ah
[07:22:21] <anew> k let me try thx
[07:22:24] <ajpiano> i mean, you can
[07:22:54] <ajpiano> i thought you meant, var fn = function() { $(document).ready(fn) }; which would be weird
[07:22:55] <ajpiano> anyway, gl
[07:23:06] <anew> thx ajpiano .. i'll be back
[07:23:13] <Krambiorix> Cork, one more question about the autocomplete. How can i search on all item options? now i only search on item.label but it would be nice to search on item.usercreated
[07:24:41] <Cork> Krambiorix: uh, not 100% about this, but i think you need to use a sunction for source
[07:25:20] <Cork> Krambiorix: but it searches the value element, not the label
[07:25:29] <Cork> (unless value is missing)
[07:25:53] <ajpiano> Krambiorix: yea cork is right, you use a source: function() { }
[07:26:10] <ajpiano> then you can do any arbitrary data filtering you want, either by passing more params to the server req or filtering the data you get in response
[07:26:48] <ajpiano> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[07:28:55] <Cork> catmando: files looks like it is read only in firefox
[07:29:52] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, this doesn't work : http://jsfiddle.net/T44ue/
[07:30:41] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: View the console.
[07:37:38] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, just changing the source to a function doesn't do it
[07:38:08] <Cork> Krambiorix: you would have to modify what you pass to jquery
[07:38:14] <Cork> uh, sorry autocomplete
[07:38:50] <Krambiorix> Cork, i can't name them all "label"
[07:39:27] <ajpiano> Krambiorix: you don't just "change it to a function"
[07:39:35] <ajpiano> you have to read about how the option to use a function works
[07:39:37] <ajpiano> and implement it
[07:40:21] <ajpiano> Krambiorix:  getResult is async, it just returns an empty array
[07:42:05] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, hmmm
[07:42:23] <Krambiorix> indeed
[07:43:02] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, even when i use async:false, ?
[07:43:20] <ajpiano> i'll give you a hint, it's source: function(req, resp) {  $.ajax({success: function(data) {  resp(data);  } });   }
[07:43:39] <ajpiano> that's not the right way to solve the problem, the source callback is designed to handle the data source being asynchronous
[07:43:49] <ajpiano> cause it passes you the continuation 'response' function
[07:43:55] <ajpiano> to invoke when your data is ready
[07:44:31] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, you lost me
[07:44:50] <ajpiano> sorry?
[07:45:09] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, i don't understand
[07:45:11] <ajpiano> when you have gotten your data
[07:45:23] <ajpiano> you cal the 'response' function that is provided as an argument to the source callback
[07:45:34] <ajpiano> look at this demo http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[07:45:55] <ajpiano> and read http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[07:47:14] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, i don't understand what the getResponse is doing
[07:47:30] <Krambiorix> sry i meant response()
[07:47:51] <ajpiano> it's a function that the autocomplete passes to you, and then you call it
[07:48:03] <ajpiano> and it allows you to manage asynchronous code without blocking
[07:48:38] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, but then i can't re-use the result of the ajax call anymore
[07:48:39] <ajpiano> http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/cps/
[07:49:12] <ajpiano> what do you mean, reuse the result of the ajax call
[07:49:45] <ajpiano> you wouldn't necessarily use your getResult function in this solution
[07:52:49] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, after using it for autocomplete, i want to re-use the result later on in the function
[07:53:47] <ajpiano> you can do that
[07:56:13] <ajpiano> it's possible using deferreds, for instance
[07:56:27] <ajpiano> unfortunately i don't have time at the moment to explain a solution for your particular situation in detail at the moment
[07:58:13] <dAnjou> hey, can i chain selectors somehow without string manipulation? i don't want to build a string like "#foo .bar .baz" (note the spaces). i'd rather do something like $("#foo").$(".bar").$(".baz").
[07:58:23] <dAnjou> oh wait. there is children
[07:58:27] <dAnjou> nvm
[07:59:55] <anew> http://pastebin.com/Fx7Rbtft ok any idea why i get undefined on line 5 here... anyone know what syntax i'm missing
[08:01:28] <Cork> anew: check your error console
[08:02:41] <Pet^Aw> hi all
[08:02:55] <anew> cork it says undefined when i console.log
[08:03:02] <Cork> anew: and no errors?
[08:03:10] <anew> nope
[08:05:09] <Cork> anew: only thing i can say is the problem isn't with that part of the code http://jsfiddle.net/qxvA7/

[08:06:36] <spobat> how do I get the html text back of a element?
[08:06:43] <spobat> $('<div class="chat-entry >').getTheTextThere()
[08:06:51] <NoiseEee> spobat: see .text()
[08:06:55] <spobat> I want it to return <div class="chat-entry >
[08:07:10] <NoiseEee> thats not text, thats markup
[08:07:23] <NoiseEee> and you just used it in the selector, im confuzzled
[08:07:44] <spobat> markup?
[08:07:53] <spobat> that is not a method :p

[08:08:22] <Pet^Aw> Hello everyone, I have a problem with ui.autocomplete: i want to use textarea (id = "#write") like input for ui.autocomplete. If write characters from keyboard autocomplete work good, if try to write characters into textarea from $('# write').html('f') the autocomplete not start. Someone can help me ?
[08:08:38] <spobat> NoiseEee: neither text nor html produces the desired result
[08:09:35] <BillCriswell> spobat: You would need to get the parents html.
[08:10:19] <BillCriswell> spobat: Wait.. Why do you need that?
[08:10:36] <Krambiorix> ajpiano, now the only issue is that the letters aren't bold anymore when filtered in the autocomplete
[08:10:57] <spobat> BillCriswell: that was a very simple example :P
[08:11:05] <spobat> BillCriswell: okay, copy that
[08:12:59] <BillCriswell> spobat: http://jsfiddle.net/vbrAd/ found this code on stackoverflow, but I can't say I've ever needed to do anything like that?
[08:13:07] <worstadmin> Im having an odd jsonp issue Im getting my error: function(data) called. Its telling me "parsererror jQuery16203262476678690883_1373641183497 was not called". However Ive never specified this seemingly random string and my json is specified as "jsonp: 'posthaste'"
[08:13:11] <worstadmin> Any thoughts?
[08:14:01] <BillCriswell> Pet^Aw: I believe you want $('#write') ?
[08:16:23] <Pet^Aw> BillCriswell: i have a <textarea id="write" rows="4" cols="55"></textarea> used like input for autocomplete and 3 <li> where put the first 3 autocomplete suggestion
[08:17:18] <BillCriswell> Pet^Aw: Just know that $('# write') isn't correct.
[08:17:42] <Pet^Aw> BillCriswell: if i write into textarea with my keyboard the autocomplete script work good, if i try to "simulate" the keyboard write with the jquery command $('#write').html('f') the autocomplete not start.
[08:18:01] <BillCriswell> Pet^Aw: Oh!
[08:18:15] <BillCriswell> Pet^Aw: Do $('#write').val('f').trigger('keyup');
[08:18:23] <BillCriswell> Should get you going in the right direction.
[08:18:29] <Pet^Aw> ok i try now
[08:20:04] <BillCriswell> worstadmin: Does this explanation help? I looked around and it seemed the closest related to your issue... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1002367/jquery-ajax-jsonp-ignores-a-timeout-and-doesnt-fire-the-error-event/1002797#1002797

[08:26:29] <anew> billcriswell can you help
[08:26:43] <Pet^Aw> BillCriswell: .trigger('change')   not work
[08:27:29] <BillCriswell> Pet^Aw: Are there any errors? Just saying it doesn't work doesn't help at all.

[08:36:22] <anew>  http://jsfiddle.net/eejKE/ here is the entire thing... the user clicks 'state' (works) and goes back to see a list of states, the user clicks a state (works) and gets taken to see a list of cities - now if the user clicks 'state' to go back again to see a list of states it does not work.  i dont know why it works one time, but not the second. please help been on this for a day
[08:38:15] <chase-work> I have an event listener attached to the window listening for a pop state change, in safari it works, but in FF the pop state isn't detected.
[08:38:35] <anew> when the user clicks state -> the next page you cannot see here, but it is a list of all states in usa.  now the user clicks a state to see a list of cities (back to this page) and sees a list of cities, if the user clicks 'state' again it will not take the user back to see the list of states again
[08:40:00] <chase-work> but if i paste it into the console after the page has loaded, the pop state listener triggers

[08:47:04] <snover> ?faq
[08:47:05] <bot-t> FAQ: http://docs.jquery.com/FAQ
[08:47:28] <BlakeH> My question is, how can i append the option:selected" to the element reference?
[08:47:40] <snover> ?faq @ BlakeH
[08:47:41] <bot-t> BlakeH, FAQ: http://docs.jquery.com/FAQ
[08:48:26] <BlakeH> Unfortunately, you cannot concatenate strings to objects.
[08:48:49] <BlakeH> Im 99% certain that i've done this before.
[08:48:57] <BillCriswell> anew: Something came up at work :-/
[08:52:53] <dabear> BlakeH: .find
[08:53:09] <BillCriswell> BlakeH: $(element).find('option:selected')
[08:53:31] <BlakeH> That works, thanks BillCriswell
[08:55:05] <dabear> why would anyone event think of concating a string to an html element and expect another html element in return?
[08:55:15] <dabear> that makes no sense, in any language
[08:55:54] <jedimind> wat
[08:56:07] <Soltis> Let's say I have an empty div and I want to insert some text into it, followed by an input element. What's a reasonable way to do that?

[08:57:27] <Soltis> BillCriswell: Okay, thanks.
[08:57:43] <Krambiorix> in a click event function i try   e.target.closest("table")    but this returns e.target.closest is not a function   ... How can i solve this?
[08:58:37] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: $(e.target).closest('table')
[08:58:52] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, thanks! but why can't i do that?
[08:58:54] <BillCriswell> e.target is a dom element without jquery wrapping its sext self aroun it.
[08:59:02] <BillCriswell> its sexy self*
[08:59:04] <BillCriswell> around
[08:59:09] <dabear> Krambiorix: e.target is an html element object, not a jquery object
[08:59:29] <dabear> oh, forgot to scroll
[08:59:31] <Krambiorix> ooow okay, thanks !
[08:59:50] <BillCriswell> daaaaabears da bears da bears da bears.
[09:00:42] <Krambiorix> to store data on about a table , eg. documenttype, can i just put it in html like <table documenttype="test" ....
[09:01:41] <dabear> Krambiorix: yes, but use data attributes
[09:01:51] <dabear> <table data-documenttype="test">
[09:02:00] <Krambiorix> why use data atttr?
[09:02:02] <dabear> $("table").data("documenttype")
[09:02:07] <Krambiorix> ow
[09:02:47] <Krambiorix> thanks!!!!
[09:03:38] <dabear> Krambiorix: http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[09:04:17] <Krambiorix> dabear, thanks ... And is there something like last click event or something?
[09:04:29] <dabear> lastclick?
[09:04:52] <dabear> gotta do that your self, I guess
[09:05:01] <dabear> why you need that though, beats me :/
[09:05:42] <dblosevn> Hey guys, anybody got a recomendation for a jquery multi upload plugin that supports degradation and perl?
[09:06:44] <dblosevn> Ive liked the blueimp uploader for a while but I dont really know perl and it doesnt have a perl upload module.
[09:07:06] <Krambiorix> dabear, cause in the tagIt afterTagAdded  i want to get the clicked autocomplete element
[09:07:56] <dblosevn> and the shared environment my clients website is hosted in doesnt allow changes to php ini settings via php.ini or htaccess and I cant deal with a 1mb max upload size in php
[09:08:25] <dabear> Krambiorix: find a common container that contains all autocomplete elements, use .on("click", ".autoclickclasshere", function(e){   }  )
[09:08:37] <dabear> and store "e" somewhere you can reuse it
[09:10:49] <jawr> anyone know of any issues with kquery file upload where it uploads the file twice?
[09:10:52] <jawr> well
[09:10:54] <jawr> makes two posts
[09:21:18] <Krambiorix> dabear thanks!

[09:24:44] <Validatorian> Can I use jQuery's .one() method for handling a scroll? I have a modal window that I want to close if the user scrolls while it is up
[09:25:25] <killer> dabear: what i want is the ability to customize the <label> of just my choice
[09:29:18] <lexflex> hi
[09:29:31] <lexflex> question: what's the best way to implement a toggle between two functions in jQuery?
[09:30:45] <Cork> lexflex: one callback function and a switch case?
[09:31:01] <Cork> or an if/else if it only has two states
[09:31:08] <QuanSai> ugh
[09:32:37] <lexflex> Cork: where would you store the state (that you then access with switch)?
[09:35:38] <Cork> lexflex: is this from an event on an element?
[09:36:53] <catmando> Cork, thanks I had finally noticed that myself
[09:37:04] <catmando> i know you prlly don't remmeber the question
[09:37:11] <catmando> anyway, here's a question for everyone
[09:40:43] <lexflex> cork: not sure. I have a <a> element and on click I want to toggle a few things (slide in a side panel), including the appearance of the toggle button itself (through addClass/removeClass). So I'm not sure how to implement this toggle

[10:14:55] <kavi> can anyone help me
[10:17:55] <QuanSai> This damn $ is not defined stuff.
[10:17:56] <QuanSai> MY god.
[10:19:25] <BillCris_> QuanSai: Is that a serious issue?
[10:19:44] <QuanSai> BillCris_: To a prime-cut beginner like me, definitely.
[10:19:51] <QuanSai> BillCris_: I'm losing my mind.
[10:20:04] <Saaether> QuanSai means jquery isnt loaded
[10:20:20] <QuanSai> Saaether: Yeah, I've googled it. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong to load it.
[10:20:22] <BillCris_> <script src="jquery.js"></script> should be before any call to $.
[10:20:54] <smill> hey i'm trying to use .on(
[10:20:57] <smill> whoops
[10:21:03] <BillCris_> If you're using $ after you include jQuery it probably means that the link in <script src="..."></script> is wrong.
[10:21:05] <momomomomo> Remidner: $. is just a javascript function that is aliased to JQuery.
[10:21:13] <momomomomo> Reminder even
[10:21:22] <QuanSai> Alright.
[10:21:25] <QuanSai> Thanks, men.
[10:21:31] <BillCris_> Welcome.
[10:21:36] <BillCris_> Relax and try to enjoy it haha.
[10:21:54] <QuanSai> :P I wish.
[10:22:20] <smill> i'm trying to use .on() on elements that are dynamically created but its not working, is it because i dynamically created my elements with a wad of html? does jquery not parse it if its just append("<bunch of html>")
[10:23:06] <Saaether> smill that should work fine
[10:23:20] <BillCris_> smill: You have to add the on events after the elements are added to the DOM or you can do like $('.containerThanLoadsDynamicElement').on('click', '.dynamicallyCreatedElement', function(){ /* clicked */ });
[10:23:42] <BillCris_> s/containerThanLoadsDynamicElement/containerThatLoadsDynamicElement
[10:24:13] <smill> Saaether, BillGris_: thanks guys :)
[10:24:33] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[10:25:09] <BillCriswell> Event delegation is the better choice ( the second method I explained )

[10:54:47] <QuanSai> shoky: umm...
[10:54:47] <Saaether> QuanSai $('search_dooers_link') should be $('#search_dooers_link')
[10:54:54] <QuanSai> Oh
[10:54:56] <shoky> QuanSai: also, $('search_dooers_link')  looks for <search_dooers_link>
[10:55:23] <myosotis> QuanSai, your html is invalid
[10:55:45] <QuanSai> hmmm
[10:55:47] <myosotis> <a><li></a></li>
[10:55:48] <shoky> yep that too
[10:55:58] <myosotis> and bad html makes everything suck
[10:56:06] <shoky> and <div> shouldn't be child of <ul>
[10:56:19] <shoky> and <li> shouldn't be child of <div> ;p
[10:56:22] <QuanSai> yeah, I was trying anything
[10:56:33] <QuanSai> because I kept getting an error
[10:56:40] <QuanSai> I just threw everything around
[10:56:46] <QuanSai> out of frustration. :P
[10:56:48] <shoky> hint: don't
[10:56:57] <myosotis> bad html will make correct javascript code fail
[10:57:39] <QuanSai> oh
[11:12:44] <otahak> Anybody here work with google API's?
[11:17:54] <boo> Any ideas why this part of code does not work on the newest version of jquery? http://pastebin.com/1Wka4E1P There are no errors with firebug, but the result isn't the same as with jquery 1.4
[11:20:36] <otahak> anybody ever chat? lol
[11:20:56] <CWSpear> not on Fridays
[11:21:29] <myosotis> otahak, asking a more specific question is much more likely to get you an answer
[11:23:09] <j_wolf> sooooo......I'm working on some cross-browser compats right now...and I used the cycle plugin. In ie7, it displays the slideshow container for a brief second and then it 'collapses'. I cannot figure out why. There's no trailing commas
[11:23:42] <otahak> does anyone here work with google maps v3 JS api?
[11:24:17] <myosotis> if I say yes will you ask a specific question?
[11:24:35] <BillCriswell> j_wolf: overflow: hidden; on the container
[11:24:49] <j_wolf> BillCriswell: on the slideshow container?
[11:24:55] <BillCriswell> j_wolf: Yurp.
[11:26:09] <j_wolf> damn...no avail. Like I said you see it for a brief moment, then it disappears. didn't know if it was a known bug with cycle or not...trying to figure out which tree I should be barking up
[11:29:27] <BillCriswell> j_wolf: Do you have a width and height set on the container?
[11:29:44] <otahak> yes, myosotis
[11:30:02] <otahak> basically I wanted to ask someone which the best api would be to use for what Im attempting to build
[11:31:01] <j_wolf> BillCriswell: affirm. width is %, min-width is px, and height is px...do you think it has something to do with the containerresize option for jquery cycle?
[11:31:51] <BillCriswell> j_wolf: When I use to have that happen with cycle I typically set width, height and did overflow: hidden;
[11:32:21] <j_wolf> BillCriswell: hrm...I friggin hate ie7
[11:32:34] <BillCriswell> Haha, yeah. It's a jerk.
[11:36:42] <boo> When using this code - https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-postmessage/blob/master/jquery.ba-postmessage.js with jQuery 1.9 and this script http://pastebin.com/enPVbJMW firebug throws an error http://pastebin.com/kruEjaxQ is that related to new syntax when defining functions?
[11:38:41] <Konda> I'm trying to make a navigation menu with a fade and slide effect, my whole navigation bar gets affected by the script, if anyone can help me I'd be grateful! Here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5jyFF/
[11:38:59] <Saaether> boo http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[11:39:08] <Saaether> This property was removed in jQuery 1.9 and is available only through the jQuery.migrate plugin
[11:41:13] <boo> Saaether, and what's with the TypeError: $.receiveMessage is not a function ? I'm now in a bad situation, because I'm using 1.9, but not 1.4 is needed as well..
[11:42:52] <CWSpear> boo, I don't believe $.receiveMessage has ever been part of jQuery
[11:43:02] <CWSpear> So it may be a plugin you were using and then later removed?
[11:43:11] <Saaether> ya.. looks like its part of this plugin http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-postmessage/docs/files/jquery-ba-postmessage-js.html
[11:44:23] <boo> CWSpear, it's from a plugin in this link - https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-postmessage/blob/master/jquery.ba-postmessage.js the thing is that I should modify it to work with 1.9... It's probably something related to the way the function is defined
[11:48:03] <CWSpear> boo, you can always add the jQuery Migrage plugin
[11:48:09] <Saaether> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/05/08/jquery-migrate-1-2-1-released/
[11:48:12] <Saaether> download it
[11:48:55] <anew> if ( $('.state-select-js').val() === '' ){ is that allowed, how do i test if val is ''
[11:48:59] <j_wolf> BillCriswell: ugh...had nothing to do with jquery...I added some css-media-queries, and then added the media query js...but apparently my display:block wasn't over-riding the display:none for the mobile version.
[11:49:32] <BillCriswell> anew: is '' as in an empty string?
[11:49:42] <BillCriswell> or are you literally looking for ''
[11:50:20] <anew> well i have <input value ='' />
[11:51:47] <BillCriswell> Ok, so that inputs .val() would be equal to ''
[11:51:53] <anew> thx
[11:52:47] <boo> CWSpear, I know and thanks for that, but I was hoping that someone could just recommend a way of fixing it :)
[11:53:44] <CWSpear> well, downloading the migration plugin will fix it
[11:57:14] <boo> CWSpear, you are correct, just want to know what's the problem, as it just looks like a syntax problem on line 170 https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-postmessage/blob/master/jquery.ba-postmessage.js
[11:58:24] <CWSpear> I don't see any syntax problem on 170
[12:00:15] <Zitter> hi, how to append a content loaded via ajax after last table's row? Can I do something like .append(load()) ?
[12:00:47] <boo> CWSpear well firebug gave an error TypeError: $.receiveMessage is not a function therefore I assumed that it's somekind of a syntax problem
[12:01:16] <CWSpear> it's cuz you're using it and you have an error before that making that not get defined, I bet
[12:01:57] <CWSpear> You're having an error at line 67 cuz you're not using Migrate, and so it never gets to line 170, so $.receiveMessage never gets defined, so it causes an error later
[12:02:05] <CWSpear> SO, add Migrate Plugin and it will fix your issue
[12:03:03] <boo> CWSpear, that explains everything, thank you! :)
[12:03:14] <CWSpear> you're welcome
[12:04:58] <Konda> I'm trying to make a navigation menu with a fade and slide effect, my whole navigation bar gets affected by the script, if anyone can help me I'd be grateful! Here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5jyFF/
[12:22:49] <ZGirl> Does outerWidth do any rounding? I'm finding that the width returned is not quite wide enough to fit the contents if I use that to set the element's width explicitly
[12:23:24] <JonnyCash> https://squareup.com/careers any idea of something we can create a similar effect as "Square Headquarters"
[12:28:44] <CWSpear> just a parallax effect, JonnyCash
[12:28:56] <CWSpear> there are a number of parallax jQuery plugins
[12:29:06] <JonnyCash> any idea of a plugin that looks like this?
[12:29:09] <JonnyCash> we've been looking all day
[12:29:15] <graphettion> JonnyCash: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/15/parallax-content-slider-with-css3-and-jquery/
[12:33:42] <pachet> ZGirl well, the value returned is rounded because that's what the browser does
[12:33:59] <pachet> eg jquery uses element.offsetWidth, the value of which is rounded in most browsers
[12:34:44] <pachet> there are a couple of tickets open to move jquery over to subpixelly ways of determining the actual computed width
[12:34:47] <pachet> eg boundingRect
[12:34:56] <pachet> i think it's low prio though :[
[12:35:16] <pachet> short answer is, if you explicitly need floats, get the actual element reference and calculate them yourself
[13:04:46] <maxmoore14> can someone help me test this on an iphone or mac? http://jsbin.com/ugeweh/1/edit
[13:05:13] <maxmoore14> works fine in Chrome/FF/IE10
[13:05:20] <maxmoore14> no luck in Safari for Windows
[13:05:29] <eyeseye_> can anyone recommend a good library which will show a comparison/diff of two html inputs, where the output actually renders the html, as opposed to escaping it?
[13:05:39] <maxmoore14> hoping Safari on mac/iphone/ipad is ok
[13:06:30] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: Works here in Safari on my Mac.
[13:06:40] <dogarrhea> blah
[13:06:46] <dogarrhea> why are nickserv services unavailable?
[13:06:50] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: beautiful
[13:06:54] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: safari on windows is terrible software, i don't think its used by anyone
[13:07:16] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: they're up today?
[13:07:26] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: 100% agree, that's why I don't care if it works on that version. My prob is I don't have additional devices to test on
[13:07:35] <dogarrhea> NoiseEee: they're down
[13:07:45] <maxmoore14> I have a lot of users with old iphone 4
[13:07:52] <maxmoore14> not 4s. just 4
[13:07:54] <NoiseEee> dogarrhea: maybe hop on a different network, i can query nickserv for services
[13:07:58] <shoky> nickserv seems up to me
[13:08:10] <maxmoore14> anyone here have one to check?
[13:08:19] <dogarrhea> hrm i guess it was just slow
[13:09:14] <maxmoore14> alternatively - does anyone know an good browser/platform emulator for windows?
[13:26:59] <JonnyCash> graphettion: is this similar to that one? (thanks btw)
[13:27:42] <graphettion> Kind of, you'll have to change the speed of the pixels to get the effect.
[13:27:58] <graphettion> or fadeout
[13:28:16] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: I have browserstack haha
[13:28:46] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: I just started playing with that. Seems like a great tool. You like it?
[13:30:04] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: It's good for testing the basics, but debugging is a whole other story. It's just not as quick as I need it to be.
[13:30:21] <JonnyCash> graphettion:  you know which one i was referencing? The floating images right?
[13:31:23] <JonnyCash> it's more like you're  moving elements around the DOM with acceleration and stuff
[13:32:04] <graphettion> Yeah, all you have to do is modify that plugin to look like the site you showed.
[13:39:47] <brian_petersn> I am creating a printer friendly screen by using javascripts window.open and assigning that to a variable that then just doing document.write. I have jquery available in my local context and I am wondering if it is possible to manipulate the other documents DOM.
[13:41:55] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: do you happen to know a good resource for finding device usage stats? how many iphone 4 vs 4s vs 5, various android devices, etc.
[13:42:29] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: I've always just looked at the analytics for the site specifically.
[13:42:35] <myosotis> the best resource would be to gather the stats for your site
[13:42:51] <maxmoore14> my site is not live yet
[13:43:08] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: What kind of site is it?
[13:43:13] <myosotis> then just google browser usage stats... most should be just as bad as the others
[13:43:54] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: jqm app for restaurant industry
[13:44:10] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers has a nice list.
[13:44:12] <maxmoore14> soonest it goes live is 3+ months
[13:44:19] <BillCriswell> Loving all that green!
[13:44:29] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: considering a lot of the industry uses ipad, you best invest in an ipad to test.
[13:44:47] <maxmoore14> just trying to determine how important it is to support older devices
[13:45:27] <myosotis> maxmoore14, figure out how much it would cost to support each device, and let your client decide?
[13:45:29] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: is there a way to force the ipad into a legacy mode?
[13:45:52] <maxmoore14> so that I can test older versions?
[13:46:23] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: People update iOS very regularly.
[13:46:38] <NoiseEee> not as far as i know maxmoore14, but yeah, just make it os6 dependent or something
[13:47:05] <maxmoore14> cool. thanks all
[13:47:13] <BillCriswell> I want to say like... 85% of people are using the latest iOS
[13:47:40] <expondo> you guys, I've this gallery, how do I insert more images to it ? I've tryed almost everything, please ? http://pastebin.com/LSVGnnCE
[13:47:58] <expondo> 6 galleries in there, can't insert more images to each one of them
[13:49:21] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Android-Sucks.jpeg
[13:49:47] <BillCriswell> maxmoore14: That's from the latest keynote.
[13:50:10] <maxmoore14> BillCriswell: that's a good graphic. thx for that!
[13:50:17] <BillCriswell> welcome
[13:50:25] <BillCriswell> figure it doesn't get more official than that haha
[13:50:29] <maxmoore14> lol
[13:51:27] <BillCriswell> Those numbers make me happy. Wish IE's numbers looked like that.
[13:54:18] <badelat> Anyone tried using a contenteditable div in a jquery mobile page?  I can't get it to work, it shows up, but can't click into the field.
[13:56:09] <badelat> It works if I add contenteditable to the body tag.  I can edit the text in the jqm header, but still can't edit the text in the contenteditable field.
[13:59:06] <JonnyCash> anyone have a quora account?
[14:28:15] <epicowl> hello, does anyone know how I can use the jQuery object that I am loading for $ instead of django.jQuery? http://dpaste.com/1295795/ L13
[14:28:16] <epicowl> t always attaches to django.jQuery
[14:28:24] <epicowl> *it
[14:29:50] <codevinsky> can anyone help explain why i might be getting this error? http://hastebin.com/toquyoqiwu.sm
[14:32:11] <codevinsky> i guess it would help to explain that emitter is just the element that the current view inhabits
[14:37:04] <systemfault> epicowl: Not sure if that will help but take a look at the noConflict() function
[14:39:32] <Konda> I'm trying to make a navigation menu with a fade and slide effect, my whole navigation bar gets affected by the script, if anyone can help me I'd be grateful! Here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5jyFF/
[14:42:05] <asidjazz> so i got a form
[14:42:07] <asidjazz> w/ a input type=file
[14:42:16] <asidjazz> is there any easy native jquery way to grab that file in JS
[14:43:04] <shoky> `demo @ codevinsky
[14:43:06] <b-ot> codevinsky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:43:29] <codevinsky> unfortunately, it's a very large NDA application :(
[14:43:44] <shoky> fortunately, you can create a minimal testcase that reproduces your issue
[14:43:47] <codevinsky> but it's ok. I've figured out what the error -isn't-
[14:46:42] <shoky> codevinsky: my only guess is that your event binding is weird and doesn't properly reference the event handler function
[14:47:37] <codevinsky> it turned out to be the fact that i was trying to make the listener apply a different context… and you can't do that like you can with .click()
[14:48:49] <asidjazz> YOU'RE weird
[14:48:50] <asidjazz> YOU
[14:48:51] <asidjazz> moms weird
[14:48:56] <asidjazz> \o/
[14:49:06] <codevinsky> good one, buddy.
[15:01:43] <Konda> Do anyone have the link to the plugin that supports color animations in jquery? I've found some many different plugins on this site, http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project-release-api-compatibility/12x, and I dont know which one to choose.

[15:30:42] <darkpassenger> my $('.class_selector').click won't work , on the web page but will work in the console if typed manually, can anyone take a look and help me determine whats wrong ? http://pastebin.com/jmKFAhSZ
[15:32:37] <QuanSai> why doesn't this work? http://pastebin.com/Hj3bP1Ti  <-- any takers?
[15:32:49] <QuanSai> It simply won't do anything.
[15:36:26] <mrconfused786> hello
[15:40:49] <shoky> QuanSai: like i told you before,  $(document).ready(function() { ... })  is how you use $(document).ready
[15:41:22] <QuanSai> shoky: I didn't know what you were getting at. Alright. Let me see.
[15:41:30] <iRc123> What about my thingy ;)

[15:44:58] <mrconfused786> i have a set of 10 checkboxes and i only want do so some action on 8 of them.  i have an event listen attached to those 10 checkboxes
[15:45:21] <mrconfused786> how do i say for all of these 8 boxes which is NOT the one they clicked on turn off all other 7 boxes ?
[15:46:39] <mrconfused786> i've been doing for(i=0 i<["8 selectors for checkboxes"].length; i++) $(data[i])..attr('rel', null);
[15:47:05] <shoky> mrconfused786: cant know without seeing your html/code.. but could be something like..  $('.checkboxClass').not(this).prop('checked', false)
[15:47:16] <shoky> if by "turn off" you mean uncheck
[15:51:33] <iRc123> If I do: if $("#mydiv:hidden") { $(this).slideUp(); } does that only work if I got the visibility:hidden?
[15:52:32] <mrconfused786> shoky
[15:52:34] <mrconfused786> http://jsfiddle.net/99vWb/
[15:52:56] <mrconfused786> i can't do $() because i need to pass an array of the 8 selectors
[15:53:04] <mrconfused786> and not all 10
[15:54:52] <mrconfused786> shoky and they aren't checkboxes but styled liked them.
[15:58:03] <shoky> mrconfused786: don't know what result you're looking for
[16:01:55] <shoky> mrconfused786: maybe this will give you somethign to work with.. http://jsfiddle.net/99vWb/1/
[16:06:52] <QuanSai> shoky: http://pastebin.com/6kBKGPzR  <-- What about now? Doesn't do anything.  No errors in the console.
[16:07:05] <sunbeam> how can i find out which function is called when i submit a certain form?
[16:10:04] <shoky> QuanSai: you combined the jquery include and your own script into one <script>  that's wrong
[16:10:24] <shoky> QuanSai:  <script src="js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>  <script> ... </script>
[16:10:31] <QuanSai> shoky: Oh...
[16:13:16] <mrconfused786> shoky thanks
[16:13:17] <QuanSai> shoky: Still nothing.  Am I targetting the link wrong?
[16:14:45] <Propheteus> hi guys
[16:15:02] <QuanSai> 'ello
[16:15:48] <shoky> `demo @ QuanSai
[16:15:48] <b-ot> QuanSai: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:15:59] <QuanSai> Alright
[16:19:03] <shoky> QuanSai also look in your javascript console for errors
[16:19:24] <QuanSai> shoky: Yeah, I've been looking at the console. No errors whatsoever. I'll create a fiddle.
[16:25:12] <lifeiscontent> if I have a popover/modal and I want to close it if I click anywhere outside of the container how would I do that?
[16:31:16] <QuanSai> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/kwX4J/  <-- check it out?
[16:34:11] <Propheteus> guys, i need a quick tip plz, i am new to jquery / ajax world, i want to create a dynamic login page, when the user enter his username, it grab from the db his/her picture when he tab out of the username input field
[16:34:13] <Propheteus> is it doable ?
[16:40:16] <QuanSai> shoky: ?  Anyone?
[16:41:10] <blindMoe> QuanSai: you don't get any errors with that?
[16:41:37] <QuanSai> blindMoe: Nope. Not at all.  Just, when I click the link I'm targetting with click(), nothing happens.
[16:43:12] <blindMoe> What are you expecting to have happen?
[16:43:27] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/kwX4J/2/
[16:43:30] <blindMoe> seems to work fine to me
[16:44:39] <QuanSai> blindMoe: Well, when I click "Search Dooers," the div should work
[16:44:40] <QuanSai> um
[16:44:42] <QuanSai> wait
[16:45:07] <lifeiscontent> if I have a popover/modal and I want to close it if I click anywhere outside of the container how would I do that?
[16:45:09] <shoky> QuanSai: use jquery if you're using it..  e.g. $('#search_dooers').hide()
[16:45:37] <QuanSai> shoky: Like, to hide the rest of the divs I'm trying to hide?
[16:45:40] <shoky> QuanSai: anyways, getting an error with your code because some of those elements don't exist yet you're accessing their .style property: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of null
[16:46:07] <shoky> QuanSai: instead of: document.getElementById('search_dooers').style.display = "block";     do:   $('#search_dooers').show()
[16:46:11] <shoky> and so on
[16:46:44] <QuanSai> alright.
[16:46:58] <blindMoe> there are so many errors on that page I don't know where to begin ;l)
[16:47:08] <blindMoe> QuanSai: http://jsfiddle.net/kwX4J/9/
[16:47:42] <blindMoe> QuanSai: or this one: http://jsfiddle.net/kwX4J/10/
[16:47:44] <shoky> why stopPropagation?
[16:48:08] <blindMoe> QuanSai: First off you had multiple elements with the same ID .. no bueno.  You also had class=".span*"    that doesn't make much sense
[16:48:13] <blindMoe> shoky: force of habit
[16:48:28] <QuanSai> blindMoe: I'm using the Twitter Bootstrap.
[16:48:38] <blindMoe> QuanSai: that doesn't make .span* a valid class name
[16:48:57] <shoky> weird habit
[16:49:00] <blindMoe> that is a css selector .. you are looking for something like   class="span-12" or whatever it is in bootstrap
[16:49:12] <blindMoe> shoky: how so?
[16:49:29] <shoky> dunno.. it's only needed in specific cases
[16:50:02] <blindMoe> yeah but when helping people in here it seems to avoid extra questions from people when it propagates in their real code which is normally different than what they pasted
[16:50:45] <shoky> alrighty
[16:50:58] <fr4nk235> goooooood evening :D
[16:51:59] <guzzlefry_dev> Say I have $form, a JQuery object for a form, how can I select an element inside that using an attribute selector?
[16:52:46] <shoky> blindMoe: btw iirc return false already does stopPropagation for ya
[16:52:56] <blindMoe> shoky: oh really?  Nice.. didn't know that
[16:53:02] <shoky> ya
[16:53:06] <blindMoe> I got in the habit of doing both for some reason
[16:53:41] <guzzlefry_dev> I'm trying to find $('input[type="submit"]') inside it.
[16:53:51] <fr4nk235> y?
[16:53:56] <blindMoe> guzzlefry_dev: .children()  ?
[16:54:10] <shoky> blindMoe: well that's how it is in jquery. for regular event handlers it doesn't do stopPropagation for you
[16:54:34] <guzzlefry_dev> ah, I thought that only handled the immediately lower hierarchy level.
[16:54:56] <shoky> .find() for any descendants
[16:55:01] <guzzlefry_dev> ah, thank you
[16:55:05] <blindMoe> guzzlefry_dev: ahh yeah.. find()
[16:55:20] <guzzlefry_dev> I feel dumb for not guessing that one. :P
[17:03:47] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[17:03:58] <Toerkeium> do you know why it doesn't return nothing? http://www.pastebin.ca/2426199
[17:04:30] <Toerkeium> "return $.when.apply($, requests);" is undefined
[17:38:13] <shoky> Toerkeium: why aren't you returning anything from the innermost .then(..) ?
[17:38:26] <shoky> or, why have a .then there if you're not returning anything
[17:38:59] <shoky> that's the problem, i think
[17:39:28] <shoky> Toerkeium: also, var requests should be before the if (data.status == "OK") {  block
[18:16:50] <savid> Hi, I'm having trouble with using a FromData() object with jQuery's $.ajax call. I'm using the code shown here: http://sprunge.us/UTMg?js .  The form tag does have type="multipart/form-data", and I'm constructing FormData from the html form. It seems that when jQuery posts it, it sets the request content-type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded instead of multipart/form-data.  Any ideas why?
[18:27:42] <savid> Hah, well looks like I was using an outdated jquery. Upgraded to 1.10 and it's fixed.

[19:24:25] <jonathancutrell> has anyone successfully figured out how to prevent a setInterval from pausing on iPhone during a scroll?

[20:13:08] <Roundaround> jsc802: your site just game my RAM cancer
[20:14:30] <Roundaround> jsc802: I think automatically loading those images and scrolling is a bad idea.  either slow it down (a LOT), or make it just load images like that upon manual scroll
[20:15:48] <Roundaround> either way, you should be able to fix it just by manually scrolling to the bottom upon each image load completion
[20:17:04] <Roundaround> jsc802: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1890995/jquery-scroll-to-bottom-of-page-iframe
[20:39:22] <jsc802> ahh i see
[20:39:50] <jsc802> Roundaround thanks for the advice

[22:37:08] <killer> I m trying to replace input of 'firstname' and value ='First Name' on facebook.com login page but failing to do so , any suggestion how can i achieve so?
[22:39:30] <tw2113> greasemonkey script?
[22:44:26] <killer> what I m doing is :  if($("input[name='firstname' id='u_0_0']").val()=='First Namee'){$("#u_0_0").vale("test");};    but it is not working
[22:44:55] <tw2113> what's vale() ?
[22:45:44] <sunsean> Does anyone know why .context is deprecated in 1.10?
[22:49:16] <tw2113_too> killer, are you sure your selector is returning anything ?
[22:53:49] <tw2113> killer, do you have some version of jQuery loaded to use with it? It doesn't appear that the login page has jQuery loaded already
[22:58:09] <killer> tw2113: I m developing  an addon and yes the jquery is loaded , everything in the script is woring except the line above
[22:58:30] <tw2113> i don't think your selector is working
[22:58:35] <tw2113> just use the ID
[23:00:52] <killer> if ($("input[id='u_0_0']").val() == 'First Name'){   $("#u_0_0").val("test");
[23:00:52] <killer> };
[23:00:52] <killer> tw2113: I  m trying to edit faceebook login page
[23:01:24] <tw2113> how about just $('#u_0_0')
[23:01:37] <tw2113> i know what you're trying to do
[23:01:43] <tw2113> i just bet your selector fails
[23:02:22] <tw2113> if they coded their logged out page well enough, it should only have one ID like that, so no point in specifying the input part as well
[23:14:51] <ionico> hi, how can i translate this to jquery: parent.document.getElementById('layer').innerHTML = '10';
[23:15:41] <systemfault> I'd try: $(parent.document).find('#layer').html('10');
[23:15:58] <ionico> letme try
[23:16:34] <ionico> awesome works!
[23:16:36] <ionico> thanks
[23:21:13] <sunsean> .context is now depreciated. Anyone have alternative ways of saving the "query" or "find/filter" steps the user took to the current selector?
