[02:45:42] <undefined_bob> hellyeah: ya I'm reading a little bit alreay :)
[02:46:18] <undefined_bob> small typo in "A real world example with flexbox" - "current with and height"
[02:54:41] <hellyeah> damn it typo again
[02:54:46] <hellyeah> :/
[02:54:57] <undefined_bob> hehe its not too bad
[02:55:52] <hellyeah> thanks for warning btw
[02:55:59] <hellyeah> appreciated
[02:56:18] <hellyeah> i am to do something better
[02:57:00] <hellyeah> in the future
[02:57:07] <hellyeah> and hoping to find a good job
[02:57:25] <undefined_bob> I dont have a good job too
[02:57:28] <undefined_bob> so boring
[03:04:17] <hellyeah> i had
[03:04:32] <hellyeah> but people messed me around so much
[03:04:46] <hellyeah> cuz i am good at my job and people dont like it, dont apprciate it
[04:49:25] <fn> hey, got a array with years (1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2011)
[04:49:55] <fn> any idea how to sort them, so i get: 1999, 1998, 2000, 1997, 2001
[04:49:59] <fn> dynamiclly?
[05:00:33] <Cork> fn: how is that sorting? that's unsorting
[05:01:42] <Cork> you could do something like years.sort(function() { return Math.random(2) - 1; })
[05:04:29] <fn> "sort"
[05:04:37] <fn> but maybe I've got a solution, mom
[05:04:56] <Cork> fn: how is 2000 1997 2001 sorted?
[05:05:25] <Cork> that's just random
[05:12:05] <fn> x, x-1, x+1, x-2, x+2
[05:12:09] <fn> its not random!
[05:16:34] <fn> Cork: https://paste.534f.de/PGeX5179

[05:37:15] <hellyeah> and for grabbing attention of employer
[05:37:20] <hellyeah> i want to share what i know

[05:42:58] <hellyeah> fn are you asking lin of my blog? :D
[05:47:39] <fn> yes.
[05:49:55] <hellyeah> okay just check my english sorry :D
[05:50:04] <hellyeah> https://spinningcat.github.io/blog/
[05:50:25] <hellyeah> i fix typos right now i wrote some words wrong sorry for that
[06:02:03] <prillian5> How can I figure out with sortable (http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/) which Element is the previous and nextone in List of last dropped item?
[06:58:44] <fn> hellyeah: no problem
[07:44:52] <dimi1947> I have this radio button:https://hastebin.com/oqoqoneses.scala and I want to get the "yes" from it...what jquery code I will use
[07:45:30] <dimi1947> I can target the specific input with this:$('.price_show:checked')  by from this I do not know were to go
[08:26:12] <cannap> any know why this is if is true https://paste.laravel.io/38261400-78fa-4306-887b-c6c4b716ff62 when overlay is 1 ?
[08:26:15] <cannap> i cant figure out
[08:29:01] <Cork> cannap: how do you expect anyone to be able to answer that when you don't include what overlay is?
[08:29:39] <cannap> sry       const overlay = $(element).closest('.quantity-overlay')
[08:29:45] <cannap> it just a div then i check the .length
[08:30:01] <Cork> so that selector matches an element
[08:30:36] <Cork> if you want to ask why you need to create a jsfiddle with the html wrapping "element"
[08:32:13] <cannap> yes i checked the console log the console.log say 0 or 1 when is 0 or 1 the if is always true
[08:32:32] <Cork> so it has nothing to do with it most likely
[08:32:42] <Cork> make a working demo in jsfiddle if you want help
[08:39:41] <cannap> nvm the problem is something else
[08:47:26] <cannap> woa sometimes i try to hard xD
[08:55:08] <cannap> got it
[09:03:17] <bahamas> hello. I'm calling a function inside $(document).ready(). inside that function I'm setting the text and a css property on an element. however, these properties aren't set when I check the page. an idea what I'm doing wrong?
[09:03:51] <Cork> bahamas: jsfiddle.net
[09:30:57] <bahamas> Cork: this is the markup. the js is not like the one I'm actually using, because in my code I'm using the chrome.history API which is only available from an extension
[09:31:00] <bahamas> const microsecondsPerWeek = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
[09:31:11] <bahamas> https://jsfiddle.net/ykxefhy5/1/
[09:31:50] <Cork> well as long as you can reproduce the problem
[09:32:00] <Cork> ah
[09:32:12] <Cork> bahamas: $(document).ready(retrieveHistory()); is not what you want
[09:32:24] <Cork> that is the same as retrieveHistory(); $(document).ready(undefined);
[09:32:43] <Cork> you want to pass the function as a reference so without ()
[09:33:08] <Cork> currently you give the return value from retrieveHistory to .ready to run as a function
[09:33:15] <bahamas> you're right. I actually have $(document).ready(function() { RecentHistory.init(); });
[09:33:26] <bahamas> sorry for the confusion
[09:33:43] <jak2000> any advice? https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/   why not display the dialog modal form? thanks any hand?
[09:34:08] <Cork> jak2000: i've already answered this
[09:34:47] <Cork> bahamas: try to reproduce the problem you have, if you can't make jsfiddle show the problem then i can't really help you
[09:35:12] <jak2000> Cork escuse me not see
[09:35:14] <jak2000> checking
[09:35:33] <jak2000> browser console.
[09:35:43] <Cork> and the following lines too
[09:35:54] <jak2000> "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier"
[09:35:58] <Cork> exactly
[09:36:04] <jak2000> wich is this?
[09:36:23] <localh0st> jak2000: God, just learn how to debug it
[09:36:29] <jak2000> i only see this: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[09:36:32] <Cork> jak2000: ah, i never set the reset
[09:36:35] <Cork> *rest
[09:36:47] <Cork> jak2000: the configuration for the dialog is broken
[09:37:06] <Cork> the console will point you at the line the error is on
[09:37:25] <Cork> "set the reset" => "said the rest"
[09:37:56] <jak2000> form variable: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/1/
[09:38:22] <jak2000> see all levels
[09:38:34] <Cork> jak2000: check the error reference in the console
[09:38:45] <Cork> it points you at the syntax errors in the code
[09:41:58] <bahamas> Cork: if $(document).ready() was called, is it possible that an element is still not ready?
[09:47:24] <Cork> bahamas: if it is created through js, or ajax sure
[09:48:35] <jak2000> Cork i see the errors :)
[09:48:39] <jak2000> checking
[09:56:42] <bahamas> Cork: using $(window).load() works
[09:57:05] <bahamas> indeed, the code loads html files with jquery. so that might be the cause
[09:57:27] <Cork> bahamas: then you shouldn't use ready or load
[09:57:35] <Cork> use the callback from the ajax calls loading the html
[09:57:43] <Cork> else you will have a race condition
[10:03:27] <poboy> will someone help me understand this? if($("#dashboard-lists").hasClass('active'))  there's no {}  so is that saying "if dashboard-lists exists then it has class active?
[10:03:36] <poboy> https://kopy.io/9dLaH
[10:04:14] <bahamas> Cork: that works. thank you!
[10:04:20] <Cork> poboy: if without a block executes the first command after it until the first ; following it
[10:04:32] <poboy> ok thanks
[10:04:32] <Cork> (and is why it is normally considered bad practice
[10:04:34] <Cork> )
[10:04:44] <poboy> yeah.  this is not my code.  :)
[10:16:03] <Ice_Strike> Know good jquery plugin if I upload a photo it will automatically show a pic like a thumbnail. It is not a drag and drop feature.
[10:16:33] <Cork> Ice_Strike: you mean before you upload it?
[10:19:56] <Ice_Strike> Cork If that possible
[10:20:02] <Cork> sure it is
[10:20:24] <Cork> the plugin needs to use a canvas to convert the file object to an image and then scale it
[10:20:37] <Cork> (and then convert it to a blob
[10:20:39] <Cork> )
[10:21:14] <Cork> Ice_Strike: not a plugin but https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16500848/how-to-generate-a-thumbnail-image-after-adding-an-image-inside-an-input-type-fi
[10:21:37] <Cork> just bind it with $('#picker').on('change', previewFile)
[10:54:44] <Neo1> hi I have question
[10:54:53] <Neo1> Cork: do you know how check option?
[10:55:09] <Cork> option?
[10:55:17] <Cork> what option?
[10:55:17] <Neo1> Cork: I have option name and need choose option by name, not by value...
[10:55:39] <Cork> too little context
[10:55:53] <Neo1> by value easy , $('select').val('option_value');
[10:56:05] <Neo1> Cork: see this
[10:56:07] <Cork> so you want to get the current value from a select?
[10:56:26] <Cork> $('select').val()
[10:56:54] <Neo1> Cork: <select><option vvalue='1'>name1</option><option value='2'></option></select>
[10:56:59] <Cork> ...
[10:57:05] <Cork> just make a jsfiddle
[10:57:11] <Neo1> how to choose value 2?
[10:57:49] <Neo1> <option value=1>name1</option> and <option value=2>name2</option> ???
[10:58:07] <Neo1> I have name 2 , I need make selected select by name
[10:58:21] <Neo1> Cork: I don't know value
[10:58:28] <Neo1> only 'name 2'
[10:58:33] <Neo1> Cork: understood?
[10:59:08] <Neo1> How to make selected select using option name, instead value?
[10:59:24] <Neo1> Cork: do you think I need to use each?
[11:00:25] <Neo1> Cork: yes this is entrance, But this take much code... But I spent also much time asking here :(
[11:00:27] <Ice_Strike> Cork Hmmm thankyou
[11:00:40] <Neo1> Cork: do you know?
[11:02:45] <randymarsh9> taplar: hey man are you here
[11:03:08] <Neo1> randymarsh9: see how I can get text inside option? option[value="-1"]
[11:03:36] <Neo1> randymarsh9: see this <option>my_text</option> how I can choose text? Which selector need to use?
[11:03:59] <randymarsh9> Neo1: i think i had the same question, hang on
[11:03:59] <Neo1> option[text=my_text] doesn't work
[11:04:12] <Neo1> randymarsh9: and what you think?
[11:04:38] <Neo1> randymarsh9: I need make select selected by name
[11:04:46] <Neo1> I know how to do this by value
[11:04:56] <Neo1> val('value')
[11:04:56] <randymarsh9> Neo1: you want the text from the option right?
[11:06:37] <Neo1> no, I want use something like this $('option[text=mytext]). got that imput and then make selected it
[11:06:56] <Neo1> this
[11:06:58] <Neo1> wait
[11:07:21] <randymarsh9> well you can get the text by doing "$('#selector_name option:selected').text()"
[11:07:41] <Neo1> $('select').val( $('optiion[text=mytext]).val() ); I want make this
[11:07:56] <Neo1> how I can to reach option by name?
[11:08:02] <randymarsh9> and you can change a selection by doing "$('#selector_name").val(X)"
[11:08:32] <Neo1> randymarsh9: I can't, this select element don't selected still
[11:08:42] <Neo1> randymarsh9: there is not selected element
[11:08:58] <randymarsh9> ah
[11:09:01] <randymarsh9> then i'm not sure
[11:09:06] <randymarsh9> that's how i did it on mine
[11:09:37] <Neo1> randymarsh9: I have an option name , at first need got option for get value, and than make select selected by value
[11:09:49] <Neo1> how I can to reach option element by name?
[11:09:57] <randymarsh9> Neo1: i don't know i'm a jquery noob too, stick around maybe someone will be able to answer
[11:10:35] <Neo1> randymarsh9: maybe faster make search in each and make select
[11:11:47] <Neo1> randymarsh9: I found maybe $('.selDiv option:contains("Selection 1")')
[11:11:54] <Neo1> for know text
[12:00:08] <snowcatman> trying to use this example https://codepen.io/rockhill/pen/EtKsv on my page http://snowcave.ezyro.com/pages/buttontext2/buttontext6.html question is how do i get the text to show on my page? i am new to jquery.
[12:20:46] <robertmaxrees> gooooooood morning #jquery
[12:22:05] <poboy> hey robertmaxrees
[12:49:41] <snowcatman> trying to use this example https://codepen.io/rockhill/pen/EtKsv on my page http://snowcave.ezyro.com/pages/buttontext2/buttontext6.html question is how do i get the text to show in the majic 8ball? i am new to jquery.
[12:50:50] <robertmaxrees> snowcatman open your dev console :)
[12:51:29] <snowcatman> dev console?
[12:52:06] <robertmaxrees> your browser has a set of developer tools.  can right click, select "inspect" and then click "console" in the window that opens.
[12:52:08] <grapheti> F12
[12:52:11] <robertmaxrees> it'll tel you what errors you have.
[12:52:17] <grapheti> You prolly don't have jquery included
[12:52:19] <robertmaxrees> does f12 work for OSX?
[12:52:26] <grapheti> Oh, not sure.
[12:52:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:52:53] <robertmaxrees> snowcatman either way, grapheti is right, you're not including jquery onto the page./
[12:52:58] <grapheti> Option-Cmd-C I guess lol
[12:53:26] <snowcatman> k thank you
[13:01:00] <snowcatman> im still lost, guess i need to move the script to its own file, asumming the code is fine?
[13:01:18] <robertmaxrees> that's generally best, but you can make it work wiothout doing that.
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> where are you including jquery?
[13:02:06] <snowcatman> in the html file in <script>
[13:04:30] <traptrip> I'm thinking of ways to convert an html form input to JSON, with a naming convention suitable for PHP. e.g. <input type="checkbox" name="clothing[0][colors][0]" value="blue">. so that it ends up as an object: clothing.0.colors.0 = 'blue'; is there a jQuery way to do this efficiently, or would I need to write this myself?
[13:06:15] <snowcatman> http://snowcave.ezyro.com/pages/buttontext2/buttontext6.html the script is in this html page
[13:06:43] <snowcatman> thank you for your help robertmaxrees
[13:16:54] <snowcatman> ok, moved the script to its own file, but still the same error. i dont know how to fix it?
[13:17:15] <snowcatman> how do you define $
[13:18:15] <grapheti> snowcatman, I still don't see jquery on your page
[13:19:58] <snowcatman> wait, i was told to come here, becouse it was a javascript error?
[13:20:22] <grapheti> the error is telling you jquery is not on the page
[13:20:28] <grapheti> you need to reference it
[13:21:16] <grapheti> <script src="../path/to/jquery.js"></script> needs to be added above the script
[13:21:50] <taplar> Neo1: sorry, i was away from my desk
[13:21:51] <snowcatman> ok, how? becouse i took that example strait from here. https://codepen.io/rockhill/pen/EtKsv
[13:22:01] <grapheti> click the wheel next to js
[13:22:06] <grapheti> they added jquery
[13:22:19] <grapheti>  //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js
[13:23:46] <taplar> traptrip: you'll most likely have to write that yourself
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> snowcatman jquery isn't a defualt thing.
[13:29:02] <grapheti> wb
[13:29:07] <robertmaxrees> you gotta include it separately.
[13:29:47] <grapheti> I think he gots it
[13:29:58] <grapheti> you don't need this tho - <script scr="https://codepan.io/username/pen/aBcDef"></script>
[13:30:09] <snowcatman> ok
[13:30:15] <snowcatman> removing it
[13:30:28] <grapheti> kk
[13:30:28] <robertmaxrees> and it's src
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> as in "source"
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> not scr
[13:30:36] <grapheti> ^
[13:30:44] <grapheti> after that, you're solid
[13:32:08] <grapheti> When you get it working, I'm going to ask it, "Will I be in the dog house tonight?"
[13:32:30] <robertmaxrees> if you're married, obviously yes ;)
[13:33:00] <grapheti> I am. And damn!
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> #rip
[13:33:21] <grapheti> lol
[13:33:23] <taplar> that's why you need a sweet RV
[13:33:27] <grapheti> rip my rights
[13:33:56] <grapheti> https://youtu.be/VMOiwA0yytc?t=5s
[13:44:02] <snowcatman> well it still is not changed. but thank you for showing me there was more. i still am lost
[13:44:33] <robertmaxrees> still not working?
[13:45:05] <robertmaxrees> your jquery include is still bad.
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> needs to be src, not scr
[13:45:23] <snowcatman> ugh, thanks
[13:46:16] <snowcatman> ok, i need to whatch my spelling. it works now
[13:46:38] <snowcatman> thank you robertmaxrees and grapheti
[13:47:14] <grapheti> "As I see it, yes." :/
[14:03:36] <Neo1> )
[14:03:57] <robertmaxrees> (
[14:03:59] <Neo1> make task, so long do one task, all month almost
[14:04:12] <Neo1> and earn only 150$ :(
[14:04:58] <Neo1> but this is task not shame show people, it's my first real good work
[14:05:23] <robertmaxrees> why'd you under charge?
[14:05:41] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: what? 9 000 rubs is little/
[14:06:06] <robertmaxrees> ah.  thought you were stateside for a second.
[14:06:16] <robertmaxrees> no idea what the standards are elsewhere.
[14:06:38] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I estimate not good task, thought make veryfast, for 12 days and did from 28 august and only today finished :(
[14:06:52] <robertmaxrees> so first off:
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> any time you have an estimate, triple it.
[14:07:43] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I said him 20 000 rubs, he offer at first 8 000 rubs and that agreed for 9 000
[14:07:55] <ploggingdev> I am working on a disqus like comments system which can be embedded in external websites using iframes. What's the recommended way to allow login? My current approach is to use an event listener and call window.open(url). Any security implications I need to be aware of?
[14:07:55] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 300$ would be good
[14:08:06] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 is that what other people charge?
[14:08:27] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: what other people doing?
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> I'm asking if that's what other developers near you charge per hour.
[14:08:52] <ccampbell17> How come in this fiddle, when selecting multiple IDs, and using .is() false is printed? https://jsfiddle.net/gud68sx7/
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> ccampbell17 because you're selecting them wrong :)
[14:09:25] <robertmaxrees> $("#name", "#ruleDetails") should be $("#name, #ruleDetails")
[14:09:30] <ccampbell17> Haha heck yeah
[14:09:34] <ccampbell17> THANK YOU
[14:09:46] <robertmaxrees> you'r eusing a shortcut for .find() the way you have it :)
[14:11:02] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I trying get 10$ per hours, but nobody offer
[14:11:06] <ccampbell17> Thanks, really appreciate your help, I'll dig into that shortcut
[14:11:10] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see how beautiful it is https://imgbb.com/
[14:11:11] <ccampbell17> to learn more about it
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> uep.
[14:11:23] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 that's not what i'm asking.
[14:11:29] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 what do OTHER people charge per hour?
[14:11:42] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: it was calculator diet, there a few pages, dairy, statistics, my products, my dishes, my ration
[14:11:55] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 10$ is normal prices IMAO
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> "IMAO"?
[14:12:19] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, or you think more?
[14:12:26] <robertmaxrees> what does IMAO mean?
[14:12:43] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: for more need do more projects, I'm not so experienced do so fast :(
[14:13:01] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: mean my rude opinion
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> oh
[14:13:13] <robertmaxrees> you still haven't really answered my question.
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> get away from what you think you should make, etc.
[14:13:28] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: or IMHO my mind opinion, I forgot a literally definition
[14:13:29] <robertmaxrees> what do other people in your area make?
[14:13:54] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 1 500 - 2 000 $
[14:14:04] <robertmaxrees> per hour?
[14:14:10] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: can say 1000 - 2000 $ it's salary for programmers in months
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:37] <robertmaxrees> what do other freelance developers make per hour on freelance projects?
[14:14:55] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 2 000 will earn senior , 1000 will get all other staff,  majority developers getting 1000$
[14:15:03] <robertmaxrees> i give up
[14:15:21] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I don't know, other maybe more, 10$
[14:15:42] <robertmaxrees> the first thing you need to do is find out what other freelance developers charge per hour.
[14:15:56] <robertmaxrees> and then stick with that number for now.
[14:15:57] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: do you trying earn something on freelance? Why  you asking? There difficult earn 100$ if you newbie
[14:16:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm giving you advice.
[14:16:27] <robertmaxrees> when you do work below the average hourly rate, you devalue the market.
[14:16:33] <robertmaxrees> which is bad for everybody.
[14:16:36] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 10$ - 30$ magority, I watched top frilancer's profiles, there not big salary
[14:16:56] <robertmaxrees> so shoot for that range. and make sure your time estimates are good.
[14:17:09] <robertmaxrees> they can be hard to get right, but you should always add time to them.
[14:18:02] <ar2a> hi :) I was trying to get jquery ui's sortable to sort via child instead of row
[14:18:16] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, I know, Just this good agreed me, I though it's easy task. I would not to do this, but for experience it's useful
[14:18:40] <ar2a> https://i.imgur.com/t05LocW.png as you can see, the #notes div is sortable, but when i drag around, it drags each row around
[14:18:54] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: listen I got much experience even doing this task for 150$, It's also not bad
[14:18:56] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 which is fine, except that doesn't change the value of the work you do.
[14:18:56] <ar2a> I want to be able to drag each card (the divs inside row) around
[14:19:05] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 experience doesn't pay bills ;)
[14:19:45] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I got this project on fl.ru, there not like in international freelance sites. Here fix price
[14:19:55] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[14:20:25] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, but I started think about performance and speed. This is also good
[14:20:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:21:11] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I think need increase speed developing, then you can earn more, in any way this is worth do though where you work
[14:21:33] <Neo1> maybe I confused construct above sentence...
[14:21:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:21:45] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: why?
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> i didn't understand what you said.
[14:22:36] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see if I would did this task for 10 days not for month i can do still one and earn 300$ ? is it logical ? I seems yes
[14:23:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean if you developed faster, you could get more projects, which means you make more money?
[14:23:17] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:23:23] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I said in any way will useful increase performance, doesn't matter working you on freelance or something in office
[14:23:36] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't change my larger point.
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:23:51] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: now more understandable, in above I tried use 'though' first time, maybe was wrong
[14:24:23] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: what your point? increase hourly rate? This is doesn't' have sense...
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> 2 things:
[14:25:03] <robertmaxrees> 1: make sure your hourly rate is comperable with others in your area. 2: make sure your time estimates are accurate.
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> the best fix for the time estimates is to triple them.
[14:25:19] <Neo1> ok
[14:25:52] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I said this task cost 20 000 rubs, I thought this client, just he can't pay more and I was agreed
[14:26:01] <AwkwardCough> ar2a: do you have a code example of how you are applying?
[14:26:19] <ar2a> don't worry, I figured it out :). I was looking for the items: option
[14:26:21] <ar2a> scrolled past it the first time
[14:26:28] <ar2a> got a different ui problem now :/
[14:26:38] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 the issue is that when you start taking jobs like that for cheap, you drop the value of the work itself.  enough of that means that everybody makes less.
[14:26:39] <ar2a> not too sure its solvable with the way i render my ui though
[14:26:50] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I did this task behalf get experience, and maybe will do next also for not big pay, just for getting experience and building my framework
[14:27:37] <robertmaxrees> Neo1that doesn'
[14:27:42] <robertmaxrees> *that doesn't change my advice.
[14:28:16] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, I know, I tired offered more, but all clients refuse
[14:28:37] <plamb> if i redirect to URL that spawns a file download window, is there a way to detect when the user has clicked "save" in the file download window?
[14:28:48] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 150$ also not lays on the road...
[14:29:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:30:15] <ar2a> ok AwkwardCough i do have a question now
[14:30:21] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: and I'm not perfect developer, not expert. I decided take work just for experience.
[14:30:22] <AwkwardCough> shoot
[14:30:25] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: what?
[14:30:33] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 and again
[14:30:37] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my advice.
[14:30:38] <robertmaxrees> but okie.
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> Good luck :)
[14:31:03] <ar2a> https://streamable.com/wxb5w when i move from row-row, it fucks up. It's obvious why - https://i.imgur.com/8bKpsSM.png the row has 4 columns with space for 3. Is there a way to move the last one to the next column or something?
[14:31:17] <ar2a> to the next row**
[14:31:19] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I know, what you offer,  nothing do and wait while me hire rich client? You can sitting all month and nothing earn...
[14:31:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:32:10] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: you think there everybody gladly wants pay you much. No there everybody wants lime more cheaper
[14:32:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a pretty crappy place then.
[14:33:13] <Neo1> no, just pay money for nothing no one will not do
[14:33:31] <ar2a> not as easy as that actually, needs to start from the top and make sure each row only has 3 columns in it
[14:33:34] <ar2a> if not it has to reorganise
[14:34:16] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: you need work more fast and do more work, then you will earn more, It's a key on freelance, It's my mind.
[14:34:25] <ar2a> AwkwardCough:
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 that's not at all the case here.
[14:34:29] <robertmaxrees> but alright :)
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> whatever works for you.
[14:36:04] <AwkwardCough> ar2a so you want to basically check to see if there is room for it in the row or do you want it to push the one there is no room for to a new row?
[14:36:36] <ar2a> the latter
[14:36:39] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see how beautiful this look https://ibb.co/jROjeQ
[14:36:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:36:52] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I add this work to my portfolio...
[14:36:55] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[14:36:56] <ar2a> my idea was to go through every row, if theres more than 4 divs then move the final to the start of the next row and then scan that, going on and on and on
[14:37:04] <ar2a> but im a massive jquery/js noob
[14:40:24] <ar2a> AwkwardCough: https://ptpb.pw/GByT.js
[14:40:26] <ar2a> got this so far, and it works
[14:40:43] <ar2a> now the only thing to do is reorder
[14:41:34] <AwkwardCough> I may be wrong but I think sortable does this automatically if you dont have the individual rows split out in rows?
[14:41:55] <ar2a> that causes other issues
[14:42:01] <ar2a> also are you telling me not to put each row in a row tag :p
[14:42:03] <ar2a> silly
[14:42:57] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: my client very satisfied, He said me now, with me was very nice work, and he leave me tomorow positive review, What you still need for your self esteem?
[14:43:10] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 i don't need anything.
[14:43:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:43:30] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: do you know how to train champions, How growing them?
[14:43:44] <robertmaxrees> lol just let it go duder.
[14:43:45] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[14:44:32] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: but this is very nice client give me compliments, it's make me more confidence in my strengths. Motivate continue work
[14:44:43] <robertmaxrees> great.
[14:44:49] <AwkwardCough> ar2a I think you could put them in a single row and set a width on it and it will split them out
[14:44:59] <AwkwardCough> example I found http://jsfiddle.net/8mvLT/10/
[14:47:46] * taplar is happy today
[14:49:59] <plamb> did $(...).unload() get replaced by something else?
[14:50:42] <ar2a> AwkwardCough: I figured it out :)
[14:51:12] <ar2a> https://hastebin.com/xogudipale.js
[14:51:38] <taplar> plamb: try on('unload')
[14:51:43] <AwkwardCough> ar2a ah cheers
[14:52:23] <taplar> unload() was removed in 3x
[15:15:09] <Neo1> firefox maybe not support calc ?
[15:15:41] <Neo1> width : calc(40% / 3); I got each coll differ
[15:16:07] <taplar> that's a css question
[15:47:46] <graingert> plamb: if you install the shim it should print a console log with the fix
[16:02:43] <Neo1> guys, who like read which books for relax?
[16:09:33] <huck5> If a jQuery selector returns more than one result, will the results always be in the order "top of page to bottom of page"?
[16:09:49] <huck5> I.e., will the "highest in the page" element always be the first element in the array?
[16:10:19] <huck5> Or is that a ridiculous assumption to make.
[16:13:12] <taplar> huck5: i believe that is a safe assumption
[16:13:32] <huck5> Awesome! That saves some additional checking I would otherwise have to do. Cheers taplar
[16:13:36] <taplar> it traverses the tree, and should return them in the order encounted in the tree
[16:14:01] <huck5> Yeah, that was my initial assumption. But I thought I should check with a more knowledgeable source first. Thanks!
[16:35:29] <diony> hey guys need some help removing classes from divs and append new one via jQuery https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VMKVNd
[16:36:24] <taplar> what's the question?
[16:37:34] <taplar> you can use addClass and removeClass to change classes on objects
[16:40:40] <diony> @taplar how do i make sure it hapends for each div do i need for each??
[16:41:03] <taplar> no, it will iterate over the elements it found in the $(selector)
[16:41:09] <diony> ok cool
[16:42:12] <z1haze> in what version of jquery is $.ajax a promise?
[16:43:00] <taplar> i'm assuming it always has been, provided the browser has native promise support
[16:43:27] <z1haze> $.ajax().then is telling me its not a function
[16:43:48] <taplar> what version of jquery are you using?
[16:43:56] <z1haze> $.ajax(...).then(...).catch
[16:44:00] <z1haze> 2.2.4
[16:44:12] <taplar> that should be fine then
[16:44:25] <z1haze> index.js:71 Uncaught TypeError: $.ajax(...).then(...).catch is not a function
[16:44:37] <shoky_> .catch is only from 3.0
[16:44:52] <z1haze> gahh
[16:44:59] <shoky_> only in 3.0 jquery has real promises ;p
[16:45:01] <z1haze> what do I need to do for the older versions?
[16:45:06] <shoky_> .fail
[16:45:12] <z1haze> .then().fail()?
[16:46:06] <taplar> or just stick it in the then
[16:46:07] <shoky_> ya. though .fail doesn't have same semantics as .catch
[16:46:33] <taplar> then(successCallback, failureCallback)
[16:47:06] <z1haze> ah ok thanks guys
[16:48:04] <taplar> so what exactly does it do for non-promise browsers like IE?  i think i looked at the source once and saw something like window.setTimeout(something) or the like
[16:48:17] <taplar> though maybe that was in relation to the doc ready
[16:48:29] <shoky_> what does what do?
[16:48:46] <taplar> jQuery fake promises
[16:49:16] <shoky_> same as any promises library? promises don't need any special native functionality
[16:50:05] <taplar> so is it just like a timeout that is periodically checking the state i guess?
[16:50:37] <shoky_> no need to check anything periodically, it knows when its resolved/rejected
[16:51:02] <taplar> the xhr you mean?
[16:51:07] <shoky_> (because .resolve or .reject is called on the deferred)
[16:51:15] <shoky_> no , jquery fake promises
[16:51:24] <shoky_> deferreds
[16:51:57] <grapheti> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.promise
[16:52:04] <z1haze> taplar, so the callback is the function it will call, not the actual response?
[16:52:17] <jak2000> now run my fiddle!!! Cork thanks
[16:52:28] <z1haze> .then(function(successcallback, failurecallback) {... then i need a function called successcallback?
[16:52:33] <jak2000> now: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/9/  how to change the cell color when user pickup (chooose a color)?
[16:52:34] <shoky_> grapheti that's just the  $().promise  method, not really related
[16:52:42] <shoky_> or, not really relevant
[16:53:02] <grapheti> I promise you to shuddup!
[16:53:04] <taplar> i'm looking at the Deffered factory now
[16:53:27] <diony> taplar: hey can you check what im doing wrong please https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VMKVNd
[16:53:45] <grapheti> how u shoky_?
[16:53:54] <z1haze> taplar, can you explain the .then(successCallback, failureCallback) ?
[16:53:54] <taplar> diony: you can't repeat ids
[16:54:02] <shoky_> aight, sups
[16:54:08] <z1haze> it doesnt seem to follow the docs
[16:54:10] <grapheti> nm nm
[16:54:40] <diony> taplar: same name one is ID other is class?
[16:54:45] <taplar> z1haze: https://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/#deferred-then-doneCallbacks-failCallbacks
[16:54:48] <shoky_> z1haze: the callbacks are called "filters" in the .then docs
[16:55:26] <taplar> diony: one sec, you have your before and after markup in there.  that may be messing it up
[16:56:07] <diony> taplar: i am just explaining the end result in the code pen but running it elsewhere
[16:57:07] <taplar> what version of jquery is this using?  i'm not familiar with codepen that well
[16:57:22] <diony> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js
[16:57:41] <taplar> ok, so that's an incorrect usage of load() with 3x
[16:57:50] <taplar> you will want to use on('load', ... )
[16:59:19] <taplar> or if you take off the load from the codepen it will work
[16:59:41] <taplar> since codepen may be rendering the 'result' in a way that doesn't cause a load event to happen
[16:59:42] <z1haze> can i do $(el).html(error.responseText) ?
[17:00:00] <z1haze> nothing seems to be happening
[17:00:12] <taplar> console.log(error.responseText); ?
[17:00:24] <z1haze> its html thats getting returned
[17:00:31] <diony> taplar: let me take off on load
[17:00:33] <taplar> you see it log it if you do that?
[17:00:51] <z1haze> yea
[17:00:53] <z1haze> its all there
[17:00:58] <taplar> what is 'el'?
[17:01:20] <Neo1> element maybe
[17:01:52] <z1haze> thats just pseudocode
[17:01:58] <Neo1> I today got error relate to this .html()
[17:02:05] <z1haze> i just meant in general can you apply the responseText to html()
[17:02:09] <taplar> ok, so if you do console.log($(el).length); what do you get?
[17:02:12] <taplar> yes
[17:02:13] <z1haze> 1
[17:02:47] <taplar> then i don't see an issue with that syntax
[17:03:24] <Neo1> used $('class td:thn-child(1)').html("<i></I>"); and it's only once work and other selectors did nto called with 2 3 4 numbers
[17:03:43] <Neo1> just next used .text() instead
[17:03:43] <z1haze> wonder whats going on then
[17:03:57] <taplar> Neo1: what?
[17:04:23] <Neo1> I about that function .html() and selector nth-child()
[17:04:36] <Neo1> need do this in revers order
[17:04:39] <taplar> html() doesn't really matter in relation to what the selector is
[17:04:46] <taplar> it's going to operate off of the result stack
[17:04:59] <Neo1> yes it's count selector which I insert before maybe
[17:05:25] <taplar> i'm not understanding what issue you're stating
[17:05:51] <jak2000> updated my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/11/
[17:06:10] <jak2000> taplar any advice?
[17:06:34] <taplar> i missed the original question.  change cell color?
[17:06:43] <Neo1> $('table.my td:nth-child(0)' ).html('<i></i>'+var'); $('table.my td:nth-child(1)' ).text(var);, Second function can don't call
[17:07:07] <Neo1> need to do in revers order or insert call .html last
[17:07:08] <taplar> '<i></i>'+var' isn't valid
[17:07:26] <Neo1> I confused
[17:07:39] <jak2000> taplar yes
[17:07:42] <taplar> '<i>'+ var +'</i>' is probably what you were meaning to do
[17:07:59] <jak2000> first question, change cell color.... and second, initially how to color the cell....
[17:08:02] <Neo1> I used this <i> to add icon for edit button
[17:08:28] <taplar> ok, well if that's the case you had a trailing ' at the end that would be a syntax error
[17:08:38] <newbie> join #javascript
[17:08:59] <Neo1> taplar: no .html('<i class="fa fa-someicond"></i>'+var);
[17:09:14] <taplar> ok, that's valud
[17:09:22] <Neo1> taplar: if I used text instead, html bad output
[17:09:33] <taplar> text() escapes html
[17:09:44] <taplar> or rather, it creates it as a textNode
[17:10:12] <Neo1> yes
[17:10:18] <taplar> TextNodes are not rendered by the browser.  they are treated as plain text
[17:10:25] <Neo1> I did html for this button http://prntscr.com/goih02
[17:10:37] <Neo1> minus for delete row and pen for edit
[17:10:46] <taplar> ok?
[17:10:51] <Neo1> pen originate dialog
[17:11:00] <taplar> so html() worked for you
[17:11:15] <Neo1> worked when I called last
[17:11:30] <jak2000> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/15/   second question done....
[17:11:50] <Neo1> it work and all other nth-child(2) ... 3 4 5 did not work
[17:12:07] <taplar> did 3 4 5 return results?
[17:12:19] <Neo1> did not have time research why. I put that after tham
[17:12:21] <Neo1> yes
[17:12:26] <taplar> are you sure?
[17:12:27] <Neo1> was empty
[17:12:31] <Neo1> yes
[17:12:36] <taplar> what do you mean empty?
[17:12:46] <Neo1> wait I show code
[17:12:51] <Neo1> if find
[17:12:53] <taplar> yes please
[17:14:50] <taplar> jak2000: so I assume in the changeColor method you need to grab the value of that color selector to use it
[17:15:36] <Neo1> row 34 - 37 https://hastebin.com/okonizeraw.sm
[17:15:48] <Neo1> this is did not work when first call 37 row
[17:16:15] <taplar> console.log(row.closest('.product').find('td:nth-child(4)').length); and see what you get
[17:16:31] <Neo1> row.closest('.product').find('td:nth-child(1)').html("<i class=\"fa fa-pencil-square-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>"+msg['data']['name']);
[17:16:31] <Neo1>           
[17:16:40] <Neo1> no this code wholly working
[17:17:18] <taplar> all of this works?
[17:17:22] <Neo1> it's not work at first when I am making call at first this row.closest('.product').find('td:nth-child(1)')
[17:17:30] <Neo1> yes all perfect work
[17:17:37] <jak2000> taplar: var color = $("#xcolor").val();
[17:17:37] <taplar> lol
[17:17:43] <jak2000> how to change the color cell?
[17:17:43] <taplar> why are you showing it to me then?
[17:17:46] <Neo1> perfectly work
[17:17:53] <taplar> i was asking to see the version that you had that was not working
[17:18:02] <Neo1> you asked and I show
[17:18:09] <jak2000> the <td> cell have a class nameD: class='color'
[17:18:12] <taplar> no, i asked for the non-working version that you said didn't work
[17:18:25] <taplar> so i could potentially help you figure out why it did not
[17:18:51] <Neo1> taplar: see here http://prntscr.com/goiklt
[17:19:01] <taplar> jak2000: yeah, i'm trying to look at it, heh.  for some reason it seems selecting a color doesn't change the value, but doing the slider on the rhs of the popup does
[17:19:05] <taplar> kinda weird
[17:19:12] <Neo1> taplar: do you noticed order nth-child(1) placed last?
[17:19:24] <hellyeah> you try to change with .val() ?
[17:19:25] <Neo1> taplar: when I do in right order I got nothing
[17:19:48] <taplar> you're saying it you put that first then nothing works?
[17:19:58] <Neo1> nth-child()
[17:20:27] <Neo1> yes exactly, when I am writing that I am doing this in order
[17:20:36] <taplar> that doesn't really make sense
[17:20:41] <Neo1> taplar: why?
[17:20:49] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue
[17:21:06] <taplar> cause you are not creating new tds, so if you can find the 3rd or whatever, you can certainly find the 1st
[17:21:18] <Neo1> taplar: oh, tired,now, this need all place there, there html is big
[17:21:25] <Neo1> taplar: doesn't matter all work
[17:21:47] <Neo1> taplar: there reason maybe in this nth-child
[17:22:14] <Neo1> maybe this selector after put <i></i> started count not correctly
[17:22:37] <Neo1> with text work good in right order
[17:23:00] <taplar> Neo1: if you want help debugging why it didn't work, please make a fiddle demonstrating the issue
[17:23:24] <Neo1> taplar: passed this, When I making code frequently I dodn't understand why it's not work, and just guest how need right
[17:24:13] <Neo1> taplar: ok, not now. I dont want know reason why, much tired :(
[17:24:18] <hellyeah> taplar:
[17:24:28] <hellyeah> you will have hadhache
[17:24:33] <hellyeah> thats for sure
[17:24:51] <hellyeah> Neo1:  listen what he said
[17:25:42] <Neo1> taplar: in your practice sometimes happened when you do code and there some errors which you did not understand why they appear and what call them. It's the same case )
[17:26:18] <Neo1> hellyeah: ok. thanks for your advise
[17:27:04] <taplar> jak2000: got it, https://jsfiddle.net/99Lk3mak/16/
[17:27:32] <jak2000> checking
[17:27:33] <taplar> Neo1: if i come across an issue i don't understand, i investigate it until I do
[17:27:39] <taplar> that's the only way you learn
[17:28:29] <jak2000> done: var newHexColor = $('#xcolor').val();
[17:28:32] <jak2000> sorry
[17:28:33] <taplar> jak2000: i didn't change the text in the area, but that's just a small additional change
[17:29:06] <taplar> i attached the row in the button click: dialogColor.prop('row', wRenglon);
[17:29:08] <jak2000> beautiful...
[17:29:39] <Neo1> yes I understand, I also interesting know a reason why, but dig is time. and all solved good changed order
[17:30:22] <Neo1> today solved many errors
[17:30:31] <jak2000> exist a way for check if background color and text color Contrast? sameple imagine bacground color BLACK and txtColor: cherry   <--- horrible, but is perfect combination: backgroudn color BLACK and text color Yellow or White..... is possible detect 1rst case?
[17:30:38] <newbie> taplar:  you can have hadhache
[17:30:44] <newbie> because of Neo1
[17:31:16] <taplar> jak2000: oh, idk about that.
[17:31:34] <jak2000> not understand ?
[17:31:40] <taplar> no i think i do
[17:31:43] <jak2000> *sample
[17:31:53] <taplar> but i don't really know what the logic would be to determine if two colors are 'contrasting'
[17:32:04] <Neo1> jquery UI  bad display when it include above bootstrap. Bootstrap is breaking jquery UI. Need always include below
[17:34:13] <jak2000> taplar other thing: https://jsfiddle.net/99Lk3mak/16/   when you press changecolor button it display a black color initially right? how to get the color cell and put it on color input?
[17:34:31] <jak2000> i try in line32
[17:34:34] <jak2000> but not work
[17:34:38] <hellyeah> jak2000:  any posibility that will help you http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/
[17:34:50] <jak2000> hellyeah thanks reading
[17:35:09] <Neo1> I spent much time on this code  $("select.s_all_product option").filter(function() {
[17:35:09] <Neo1>       //may want to use $.trim in here
[17:35:09] <Neo1>       return $(this).text() == name;
[17:35:09] <Neo1>     }).prop('selected', true);
[17:35:19] <taplar> get the css('backgroundColor') off of the color td
[17:35:29] <taplar> jak2000: ^
[17:36:11] <taplar> you're essentially going backwards from the set, when you do the click logic
[17:36:40] <Neo1> impossible get block option using this $('select option[text=option_name]')
[17:36:50] <Neo1> exists for this filter
[17:37:00] <taplar> :contains() should search for text
[17:37:12] <Neo1> it's not correct search
[17:37:15] <Neo1> I tried this
[17:37:15] <jak2000> var wxcolor = wRenglon.find("td:nth-child(2)");
[17:37:23] <jak2000> alert(wxcolor.text());  give me the color
[17:37:26] <taplar> jak2000: use the find('.color')
[17:37:35] <jak2000> in first case: #CCFFCC
[17:37:35] <jak2000> ok
[17:38:01] <Neo1> if you use contains('a') it's will searched a and aa and each word which contains 'a'
[17:38:03] <jak2000> same: var wxcolor = wRenglon.find(".color");
[17:38:17] <taplar> right, but that's a bit nicer
[17:38:25] <Neo1> filter only helped
[17:38:27] <taplar> you're relying on a non-positional lookup, :)
[17:38:28] <jak2000> display:  #CCFFCC      but this not set the color: $("#xcolor").val(wxcolor);
[17:38:40] <taplar> jak2000: show me?
[17:38:56] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/21/
[17:39:44] <taplar> you're not getting the css('backgroundColor') off it
[17:40:30] <jak2000> var wxcolor = wRenglon.find(".color");   <--- this get the hex color, not?
[17:40:41] <taplar> no, that's the td
[17:41:07] <Neo1> "background-color:#CCFFCC;
[17:41:23] <taplar> ooooh, and if you do just css, it pulls it back in rgb version, fk
[17:41:57] <taplar> so yeah, text will work better there, https://jsfiddle.net/99Lk3mak/23/
[17:42:01] <hellyeah> use .css('backgroundColor')
[17:42:02] <Neo1> for change color need to reach element and call this function .css('background-color', 'your new calor');
[17:42:14] <hellyeah> i am sure you can convert it to whatever value type you want
[17:42:32] <Neo1> $('need selector').css('background-color', 'new color');
[17:43:45] <taplar> jquery understands that and camel case in the css getter and setter
[17:44:26] <hellyeah> i just did it accidentally :)
[17:44:28] <taplar> as the actual property on the element is in camel case
[17:44:51] <hellyeah> PascalCase, camelCase right
[17:44:52] <taplar> ex.  document.body.style.backgroundColor = '#888';
[17:45:22] <hellyeah> isnt it javascript?
[17:45:34] <taplar> jquery is javascript
[17:45:50] <hellyeah> yeah
[17:45:52] <hellyeah> hmm
[17:46:01] <hellyeah> may be i should say vanilla javascriot
[17:46:11] <hellyeah> javascript instead of just javascript
[17:46:11] <taplar> yeah, that's vanilla
[17:46:23] <Neo1> better use clean jQuery, Javascript has bad syntax
[17:46:35] <taplar> uh, it all depends on how you write it
[17:46:37] <jak2000> ok, testing
[17:46:38] <jak2000> thanks
[17:46:42] <taplar> like i said, jquery is javascript
[17:47:13] <Neo1> Can consider jQuery like a new language
[17:47:18] <taplar> not really
[17:47:40] <taplar> making a library doesn't constitute a new language
[17:48:46] <Neo1> I think javascript created to build libs, and jQuery to build plugins. Simply divide it for their apply
[17:49:16] <Neo1> taplar: no it's like, you can review it like new language because its have new functions
[17:49:29] <Neo1> there all new
[17:49:39] <taplar> so if I make an object, put api methods on it that do stuff, then i created a new language?
[17:49:40] <z1haze> how do you pass a callback to a function?
[17:49:54] <jak2000> done thanks taplar Neo1 hellyeah
[17:49:57] <taplar> z1haze: you give it the function nanme
[17:49:59] <Neo1> you can say if you know javascript you know jQuery, Now You need to learn all from zero
[17:50:00] <taplar> *name
[17:50:06] <taplar> i didn't say that
[17:50:20] <z1haze> i have a function that submits an ajax call, but i want to do something different upon different elements calling this function
[17:50:25] <taplar> but a 'language' constitutes more than just boilerplate abstraction
[17:50:29] <z1haze> so id like be able to pass in which function to call when it completes
[17:50:30] <Neo1> taplar: yes, you can create your own language using javascript
[17:50:47] <z1haze> do i pass in the name of the function as a string?
[17:50:53] <z1haze> and do [callback]() ?
[17:50:56] <Neo1> taplar: I remember task when was need create new language using exists language
[17:50:56] <jak2000> taplar wich is the chage you made here: https://jsfiddle.net/99Lk3mak/23/
[17:51:01] <jak2000> wich line?
[17:51:03] <taplar> no, a function name is essentially a variable
[17:51:08] <taplar> you just give it the function name
[17:51:16] <taplar> without the ()
[17:51:26] <taplar> () after the name causes the invocation
[17:51:58] <taplar> jak2000: line 33 i put text() on it
[17:52:00] <z1haze> so like.. function bindToForm(el, callback) { ... .... ajax().then( callback() ? // bindToForm($(this), initModal) ?
[17:52:15] <taplar> "callback()" <-- see the () ?
[17:52:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am not on that level
[17:52:31] <hellyeah> but i understand what you mean
[17:52:37] <hellyeah> jquery is not language for sure
[17:53:05] <hellyeah> i still dont know difference between vanilla and plain
[17:53:15] <hellyeah> vanilla js, plain js
[17:53:17] <taplar> they'd be the same
[17:53:22] <z1haze> but taplar when im using the () i am attempting to call the function, right?
[17:53:30] <taplar> yes
[17:53:32] <taplar> but you don't want to call it
[17:53:48] <taplar> you are giving the method as a callback which will be invoked -later-
[17:53:56] <z1haze> let me make a paste
[17:54:15] <taplar> $.ajax(...).then(refreshPage)
[17:54:22] <taplar> say refreshPage is a function
[17:54:22] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/365XGNG
[17:54:24] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[17:54:31] <z1haze> what if the method needs arguments
[17:54:56] <taplar> you'd either make an anonymous method to pass in, or bind the arguments to it, if they are not in scope
[17:55:08] <z1haze> they are in the scope
[17:55:22] <z1haze> can you show me an example?
[17:55:29] <taplar> which one of these are you asking about?
[17:55:49] <z1haze> bindToForm(el, initModal) .. initModal() takes el as an argument
[17:56:15] <taplar> 'callback' you mean?
[17:56:25] <z1haze> yes
[17:56:34] <taplar> ok, so you'd just do callback(el)
[17:56:39] <z1haze> cool
[17:56:40] <taplar> to invoke it
[17:57:18] <z1haze> so just like this? http://dpaste.com/05TWT1N
[17:57:38] <jak2000> escuse me i better and better the fiddle, fail if change the text of the td: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/24/
[17:57:39] <taplar> yep
[17:57:41] <z1haze> sweet
[17:57:58] <taplar> jak2000: do what?
[17:58:12] <taplar> lol
[17:58:19] <taplar> you hate me don't you, :)
[17:58:26] <jak2000> sorry
[17:58:31] <jak2000> :)
[17:58:51] <taplar> hit up ##javascript, see if they know how to get the hex version of the color out of the style rather than the rgb version
[17:59:30] <taplar> brb
[18:01:46] <jak2000> something: var color = $(this).css("background-color");
[18:02:44] <taplar> that's going to return the rgb version
[18:03:54] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740700/how-to-get-hex-color-value-rather-than-rgb-value#3627747
[18:05:53] <jak2000> okay
[18:08:41] <jak2000> by moment: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/99Lk3mak/25/   rgb :(
[18:09:17] * taplar points at the S.O. link
[18:10:57] <jak2000> S.O. Operating System?
[18:14:44] <jak2000> interesting: return '#' + rgb.substr(4, rgb.indexOf(')') - 4).split(',').map((color) => parseInt(color).toString(16)).join('');
[21:01:35] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[21:02:20] <randymarsh9> i'm trying to select the text inside the second list item of an unordered list
[21:03:12] <randymarsh9> i know i can use "$( "ul li:nth-child(2)" )" to target the right row, but which method would i use to get the actual text?
[21:03:56] <randymarsh9> .text() obviously...
[21:04:01] <randymarsh9> *facepalm*
[21:04:09] <randymarsh9> i love jquery!
[21:09:47] <is_null> randymarsh9: jquery loves you back <3
[21:28:27] <poboy> lol
