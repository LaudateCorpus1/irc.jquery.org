[12:26:12] <EugenA> is there an easy way to find out if an element is visible (viewport) or not?
[12:41:18] <how2hack> why is .insertAfter() not working in this example? https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/uf1srvj0/
[13:55:12] <thecliguy> Hello. How can I iterate through each item in buttonData? See line 209: https://github.com/nikolas/markdown-toolbar/blob/master/dist/markdown-toolbar.js#L209
[15:52:11] <sine0> hey folks
[15:52:18] <sine0> where is taplar the boss
[15:52:41] <sine0> I want to use some ul li drop downs and when I select I want that stored in a variable, whats the best way to do this
[17:02:31] <how2hack> sine0: he's enjoying the weekend
[17:11:13] <pavonia> sine0: What part exactly are you having problems with, or what have you tried? The best way to do X is a highly subjective matter
[17:25:38] <how2hack> does anyone know why is .insertAfter() not working in this example? https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/uf1srvj0/
[17:43:22] <sine0> pavonia: how2hack: Im just playing with a form and I will submit to ajax function at the end, probably using a json
[17:43:59] <sine0> I want to know the best way or the right way to monitor a form with a few fields like option drop downs
[17:48:23] <pavonia> Add a deferrered event handler for the form perhaps
[17:48:32] <pavonia> *delegated
[18:21:29] <how2hack> any idea what is it i'm doing wrong?
[18:27:49] <pavonia> I think you should shorten the selector to "#cart tr.header" or so
[18:29:46] <how2hack> yea, this is working: $(html).insertAfter('tr.header')
[18:29:58] <how2hack> why's that?
[18:30:29] <how2hack> should i use .after() instead?
[18:33:06] <pavonia> While your code has <table><tr> structure, the internal structure for tables is different, it has an implicit <tbody> in between which makes your selectors not apply
[18:34:39] <how2hack> oh that's right, i completely forgot about that...
[18:34:41] <how2hack> ty
