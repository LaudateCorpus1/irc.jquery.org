[00:27:39] <Kartagis> $("#nights").on("focus", function() { <--- I have this, and yet I get "the first parameter should be 'focus'". heh
[00:29:16] <Kartagis> why is that?
[00:46:04] <dw1> gremlins in the code
[01:16:32] <DelphiWorld> hey jQueryers

[01:16:49] <DelphiWorld> do you think a tab bar can seat in a footer?
[01:31:43] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to remove a div that have an attribute with concret value: http://jsfiddle.net/L52hspxc/3/ Anyone can help me please?
[01:38:13] <FilipNortic> abailarri: the way your doing it now is strange in more than a few ways...
[01:38:33] <abailarri> FilipNortic, what?
[01:38:50] <FilipNortic> what is the messageId attribute for?
[01:39:39] <abailarri> is a custom attribute
[01:40:02] <FilipNortic> and you can't access attribute with selectors just dom elements
[01:40:15] <FilipNortic> use the attr() method for that
[01:40:24] <POLLOS> Hi
[01:40:29] <POLLOS> I'm trying to create a table with custom search input per column. My problem is that the inputs are in a tr in my table, so when I'm querying, the inputs row disappears.  Is there a way to tell Dynatable not to take this tr in account ?
[01:41:48] <abailarri> FilipNortic, can you show me an example please?
[01:42:21] <FilipNortic> abailarri: you can filter which elements to select but what you select in the end is the dom element
[01:43:11] <abailarri> FilipNortic, I solved with this: http://jsfiddle.net/km7t2sqt/7/
[01:46:43] <FilipNortic> abailarri: So you wanted to remove the element not just the attrbute... sorry seems I missunderstood
[01:46:57] <abailarri> ,-)

[02:39:59] <Erwat> does anyone have any recommendations for playing a proper spritesheet with js?
[02:40:49] <Erwat> without canvas
[02:52:27] <Kartagis> I have 3 questions: 1- is there anything I can do with javascript that I can't with jquery? 2- if I know jquery, do I also know javascript? 3- I'm in the middle of level 5 in http://try.jquery.com and I've succeeded in about 96% of challenges. when is it okay to put jquery in mv cv? 3rd question is relative, sorry for that
[02:53:03] <granden> Hi, anyone who could recommend a nice jquery plugin that would let me load an mp3-file and play it? Because I got a site that lists alot of mp3s and gets really slow on loading
[02:57:41] <DelphiWorld_> hey guys,
[02:57:50] <DelphiWorld_> is it pocible to add icons to a tab widget in jqm?
[02:59:37] <prohobo> anything is possible with js!
[02:59:40] <prohobo> ANYTHING
[02:59:51] <DelphiWorld_> prohobo: answer! answer! :P
[02:59:59] <prohobo> i have no idea what jqm is
[03:00:04] <prohobo> but i know you can add icons
[03:00:10] <prohobo> how? beats me
[03:00:32] <DelphiWorld_> prohobo: tel me please;)
[03:00:57] <prohobo> im not kidding, im sorry i have no idea, i'd have to see what the script looks like
[03:01:09] <DelphiWorld_> prohobo: ;)
[03:02:15] <Kartagis> prohobo: can I direct my question at you?
[03:02:24] <prohobo> no
[03:02:37] <prohobo> just ask
[03:02:44] <Kartagis> I have 3 questions: 1- is there anything I can do with javascript that I can't with jquery? 2- if I know jquery, do I also know javascript? 3- I'm in the middle of level 5 in http://try.jquery.com and I've succeeded in about 96% of challenges. when is it okay to put jquery in mv cv? 3rd question is relative, sorry for that
[03:03:38] <prohobo> jquery is an abstraction of javascript, it's a set of pre-defined functions and methods
[03:03:51] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: jquery is a javascript lib, bro
[03:04:10] <Kartagis> yea I know
[03:04:24] <Kartagis> so 2 = yes I take it
[03:04:25] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: so if you know js first you'lle be fast learning js
[03:04:51] <prohobo> for #2, if you know jquery you know a lot about how JS works, but you only know the lib itself
[03:05:47] <Kartagis> so, no
[03:05:57] <prohobo> you can put jquery on your cv if you can take a client's requirements and build a client-side implementation of it
[03:06:03] <prohobo> using jquery
[03:06:19] <DelphiWorld_> prohobo: stupid question, i am a blind person so i couldn't understand it
[03:06:20] <thalfeld_> can I drop in an oppinion?
[03:06:22] <prohobo> ie. make me an image gallery
[03:06:23] <DelphiWorld_> what's a favicon?
[03:06:57] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: favicon is what you see at the top of a webpage
[03:07:09] <Kartagis> thalfeld_: please do
[03:07:14] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: thank, isn't the logo at the top?
[03:07:30] <thalfeld_> putting jquery on you CV and not Javascript - will send the wrong signal to people looking for someone with those skills
[03:07:44] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: sorry, I meant browser tab when I said webpage
[03:07:52] <DelphiWorld_> ah ;)
[03:08:14] <prohobo> also i suck at JS
[03:08:20] <prohobo> i dont even know if im using it properly
[03:08:25] <prohobo> but my stuff works
[03:08:39] <Kartagis> thalfeld_: so should I say Javascript (jQuery)?
[03:09:01] <prohobo> it's not a "should"
[03:09:08] <thalfeld_> the way you frase it there is probably the most truthfull way
[03:09:27] <Kartagis> prohobo: when you lookback, do you feel the need to refactor your code?
[03:09:29] <prohobo> it's the difference between knowing JS and using jQuery
[03:09:35] <Kartagis> look back*
[03:09:35] <prohobo> uh yes
[03:09:42] <prohobo> but JS is always a clusterfuck anyway
[03:09:47] <prohobo> sry for swearing
[03:09:53] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: ... your name make me think ...
[03:10:02] <Kartagis> no fucking problem
[03:10:11] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: in what way?
[03:10:23] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: do you speak arabic?
[03:11:08] <Kartagis> my language has a lot of borrowed words from Arabic, but no
[03:11:41] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: ok, cause the name "kartage or evean "qartage" is a city from tunisia:)
[03:11:51] <ezhil> Hi all,  I just want to add one more option along with copy|paste|cut|<my option> !! is that possible to achieve by using javascript?
[03:12:00] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: you are literally the first person to think Kartagis is Arabic. people tend to think it's Greek
[03:12:16] <DelphiWorld_> :)
[03:12:23] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: your language is hebrew?
[03:12:29] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: Turkish
[03:12:44] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: ah lol i forget it completly:)
[03:13:00] <Kartagis> forget what?
[03:13:15] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: that turkish also share some comon words with arabic
[03:13:23] <Kartagis> yeah
[03:13:40] <Kartagis> like kitap
[03:13:52] <DelphiWorld_> you mean the book?
[03:14:02] <Kartagis> I think it's kitab in Arabic
[03:14:09] <Kartagis> yeah, book
[03:14:14] <DelphiWorld_> lol, yup
[03:14:17] <DelphiWorld_> kitab right
[03:15:22] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: you are from Tunisia?
[03:15:32] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: no, algeria
[03:15:57] <Kartagis> oh we are close
[03:16:13] * Kartagis looks out the window and waves
[03:16:22] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: ;)
[03:18:54] <untaken_> I have a function which does a jQuery.ajax call. When I call my function within the <script> tag, it works fine, but if I call it within a jQuery(document).ready(function () {}  the ajax fails with the error 'InternalError: too much recursion'
[03:18:58] <untaken_> any ideas?
[03:19:53] <Cork> ?paste
[03:19:53] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:20:45] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: what's a lightbox?
[03:21:11] <Cork> ?g jquery lightbox
[03:21:11] <b-ot> Cork: Fancybox - Fancy jQuery lightbox alternative → http://fancybox.net/
[03:21:17] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: you know when you click on an image and it opens in an overlay?
[03:21:18] <Cork> ...
[03:21:32] <Cork> ?g jquery lightbox -fancybox
[03:21:33] <b-ot> Cork: Lightbox - Lokesh Dhakar → http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[03:21:37] <DelphiWorld_> Kartagis: dificult to understand this craps due to my blindness
[03:22:31] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld_: when you say "blind", are you talking about a literal blindness?
[03:22:56] <DelphiWorld> Kartagis:  truely blind, no eyes at all
[03:23:04] <Kartagis> oh
[03:23:15] <Kartagis> like, 100%?
[03:23:16] <DelphiWorld> basing my computing life on text to speech
[03:23:42] <DelphiWorld> Kartagis: not 100%, but 200% cause my eyes are completly empty without eyeball
[03:24:06] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld: oh, sorry to hear that
[03:24:17] <DelphiWorld> Kartagis: ;)
[03:24:26] <decx> i think you mean )
[03:24:49] <untaken_> okay, I have pasted my problem here. http://jsfiddle.net/cLeejsqu/
[03:25:07] <untaken_> it's not gonna show anything, but you can see the JS and javascript code
[03:25:51] <untaken_> if run RenerateTable() directly in <script></script> the page loads up with a table with rows, ie the ajax call worked
[03:26:10] <untaken_> but if I do it in the jQuery(document).ready(function () {} I get  'InternalError: too much recursion'
[03:26:39] <untaken_> I have tried this technique in the past, and it has worked, but for the life of me, I can't see what the issue is this time?
[03:28:16] <Cork> untaken_: again
[03:28:18] <Cork> ?paste
[03:28:22] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:29:17] <untaken_> s**t
[03:29:22] <untaken_> think I worked it out
[03:29:30] <untaken_> I had an extra body tag lol
[03:30:12] <prohobo> lol decx
[03:31:10] <untaken_> I was including a template in our work place which included a body, explains the recursion now
[03:37:17] <lilsammy> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/p6j0XXuG but I have a problem on mobile devices
[03:38:00] <lilsammy> because when scrolling on a desktop its smooth, scrolling on a phone doesn't work while scrolling it only processes the event after you left go of the screen and stop scrolling
[03:38:13] <lilsammy> any ideas would be helpful
[03:38:31] <Cork> lilsammy: not much you can do
[03:38:35] <lilsammy> shame
[03:38:36] <Cork> nothing to be precise
[03:38:42] <lilsammy> it makes it jump which isn't great
[03:38:47] <Cork> events are fired lazily on mobile
[03:39:21] <Cork> you could try using a position: fixed element instead of doing the js fiddle
[03:39:31] <Cork> or use background-attachment
[03:40:07] <lilsammy> Yeah I will have a play around knowing its not simple helps though
[03:40:09] <lilsammy> so thanks :)
[03:40:11] <Cork> background-attachment;: fixed should fix it
[03:40:32] <Cork> *background-attachment: fixed;
[03:40:54] <decx> position fixed is pretty atrocious itself on low to midrange phones
[03:41:07] <lilsammy> Cheers will give it a shot, it was a iphone 1 I was testing it on
[03:41:28] <lilsammy> iphone 1 is best iphone
[03:41:52] <decx> you can save a few ms by not doing a lookup in your scroll event
[03:42:20] <decx> cache your element and its offset beforehand if possible
[03:42:49] <Cork> lilsammy: http://jsfiddle.net/t8btjtsd/
[03:44:18] <lilsammy> Thanks Cork
[03:44:28] <ben72> I'm trying to upgrade a jquery ui component but getting "TypeError: $.widget is not a function ui.multiselect.js:314". any ideas? I'm including jquery-ui.js before
[03:51:57] <granden> Could I dynamiccly create an <audio> tag and get the mp3-file from an data-attribute on my link?
[03:52:01] <granden> IS it possible with jquery
[03:52:24] <Cork> sure
[03:52:31] <decx> you dont even need to create an audio tag for that
[03:52:51] <granden> decx: Ok, how should I play the mp3-file then?
[03:53:17] <Zelest> i heard adobe flash is the new black!
[03:53:23] <granden> Cork: Ok, cool. could I use something like the .html() function on the location I want to place it. Or do I need to do something special.
[03:53:55] <Cork> granden: if you want to create an audio element just do $('<audio>', { src: url })
[03:54:00] <Cork> and append it where you want it
[03:54:22] <Cork> granden: alternatively you can use the audio api and just play it without adding things to the dom
[03:54:28] <Cork> but then the user won't have any controls
[03:54:45] <Cork> so it depends on what you want to do
[03:55:09] <granden> I think I would like to add it to the dom, but remove it if they click on another audio-file link.
[03:55:59] <granden> Cork: If I want to add a class to that, should I use a function or just do $('<audio class='myClass',{src: url})?
[03:56:12] <granden> oh and a closing > of course :)
[03:56:28] <Cork> $('<audio>', { src: url, class: 'something' })
[03:57:10] <granden> on each of these runs I would like to remove all old audio elements. Is that possible?
[03:57:31] <granden> I mean, If the end user clicks on another link. It should remove the first player and add a new one.
[03:57:31] <Cork> sure $('.class').remove()
[03:57:42] <granden> Awesome! Thanks!
[04:03:22] <granden> And one last question about these audio elements. :)
[04:03:45] <granden> If I got an audio element if I know the id of it. Could I play it through javascript? As if the user have pressed play?
[04:03:58] <Cork> ?mdn audio
[04:03:59] <b-ot> Cork: <audio> - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
[04:04:39] <Cork> bah it doesn't list the dom functions
[04:05:08] <decx> $('#id').get().play()
[04:05:27] <decx> or just document.getElementById('id').play()
[04:05:29] <krambiorix> hi, how can i select the parent of .deletebutton ? ------>   $("body").on('click',"table tbody tr .deletebutton",function(e){
[04:05:29] <granden> Ok, cool thank you both very much! :)
[04:06:10] <Cork> krambiorix: $(this).parent()
[04:06:36] <decx> you've been here for month, parent() shouldnt be rocketscience
[04:06:36] <Cork> bah my browser hung...
[04:06:45] <decx> months*
[04:08:57] <Cork> granden: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#playing-the-media-resource
[04:09:47] <krambiorix> Cork, decx , i want to select it in the on click select   "table tbody tr .deletebutton"
[04:10:02] <decx> my browser hangs as well on that page Cork
[04:10:07] <Cork> krambiorix: you never select a parent based on a child
[04:10:19] <Cork> krambiorix: that breaks one of the fundamental rules of css
[04:10:36] <Cork> decx: lovely
[04:11:02] <Cork> krambiorix: so you can't select the parent in the string selector
[04:11:12] <FilipNortic> yeah they even promts and ask if the site is too slow and sends you to the multipage link
[04:11:46] <decx> to be fair the html is 1.3mb
[04:12:31] <FilipNortic> which would make multipage a great default
[04:12:41] <krambiorix> ok thanks
[04:13:06] <Cork> krambiorix: the solution is to move the class or add a new one
[04:13:36] <decx> FilipNortic it is
[04:13:38] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[04:14:42] <Erwat> when i want to add a div should i use jquery's way of doing it or pure javascript?
[04:15:04] <decx> if you use jquery use jquery
[04:15:17] <decx> all depends on your requirements
[04:15:43] <Cork> Erwat: also there isn't a "jquery's way"
[04:15:52] <Cork> there is multiple ways to do it in jquery
[04:15:53] <decx> if every ms counts then createElement, otherwise use $('<>')
[04:16:25] <Cork> decx: have you actually checked if $('<elm>') is slower?
[04:16:33] <Cork> i kinda doubt it is
[04:16:36] <Erwat> i have trouble reading jquery usage there
[04:16:42] <Erwat> createelement seems so much clearer
[04:16:46] <decx> off to jsperf ^^
[04:17:05] <Cork> Erwat: document.createElement('a') => $('<a>')
[04:17:14] <Cork> those two are almost identical
[04:17:20] <Cork> Erwat: document.createElement('a') => $('<a>')[0] (is identical)
[04:17:33] <Erwat> that's exactly what i mean
[04:17:44] <Erwat> doesn't say what's going on and then there's some array there too like wtf
[04:17:59] <Erwat> but a lot of people seem to use it so i don't know which way i should write it
[04:18:01] <Cork> it is an arrayh
[04:18:09] <Cork> jquery objects is always arrays
[04:18:50] <Cork> Erwat: if you need to create multiple elements i recommend to use a template engine
[04:19:19] <decx> 3times faster here with createElement cork
[04:19:34] <Erwat> Cork: no, that stuff makes understanding it even worse
[04:19:49] <Kartagis> Cork: so, var t=$('<table>');$(document).append(t); appends a table, right?
[04:19:59] <Cork> Erwat: you should not create elements in js if you don't have to
[04:20:07] <Cork> js is for function not content
[04:20:23] <Erwat> except function and content are very VERY related
[04:20:27] <Cork> Kartagis: except you can't append to document
[04:20:40] <Cork> Erwat: doens't change the fact
[04:20:49] <Kartagis> I must append to body, right?
[04:20:51] <Cork> html is meant to hold the content, css the style
[04:20:52] <Erwat> Cork: so it's better to have 70 divs lying around that aren't visible
[04:20:56] <Erwat> than to add divs at run time?
[04:20:57] <Cork> and js makes things happen
[04:20:59] <Kartagis> $(body) ?
[04:21:07] <decx> 'body'
[04:21:12] <Cork> Erwat: or onw <script type="template>
[04:21:15] <Cork> *one
[04:21:33] <Erwat> and that has literally 0 difference because they aren't visible
[04:21:34] <Cork> Erwat: if it is more then ex adding a wrapper for styling or something like that
[04:21:36] <Cork> yes
[04:21:36] <Erwat> and need to be moved around
[04:21:46] <Erwat> since performance is important
[04:21:46] <Cork> Erwat: it is a big difference
[04:21:52] <Erwat> structure can go f off
[04:21:52] <Cork> cause what is in the script tag isn't parsed
[04:22:13] <Cork> Erwat: then why do you ask what is the best structure if you don't care?
[04:22:25] <Cork> decx: do you have a link?
[04:22:29] <Erwat> because i care about which way i should write it for others to understand what i wrote
[04:22:31] <Kartagis> $('body') ?
[04:22:43] <decx> Cork http://jsperf.com/document-createelement-vs-jquery-create/3
[04:22:44] <Cork> Kartagis: $('body') or $(document.body)
[04:22:55] <Kartagis> hrm, thanks
[04:23:24] <Cork> wow
[04:24:01] <Uhkis> 79% slower, that's pretty huge
[04:24:10] <Cork> decx: for the fun of it http://jsperf.com/document-createelement-vs-jquery-create/4
[04:24:41] <Cork> so even wrapping the dom is faster then letting jquery do it all it self
[04:24:45] <decx> the original had var a = $(document.createElement('div')); which is 2x faster
[04:24:46] <Cork> (twice)
[04:24:56] <decx> ah that's what you did too
[04:24:57] <decx> ^^
[04:25:15] <Cork> i expected it to be faster, but not by that much
[04:25:21] <Cork> not even close to be honest
[04:26:04] <decx> yeah i would'Ve thought $(document.createElement) would be similar
[04:26:25] <Cork> i expected the values to be in the same order as they are
[04:26:36] <Cork> $('<>') uses regex to detect and grab the element
[04:26:38] <decx> all those tests for #,.,< must be expensive
[04:26:39] <decx> ^^
[04:26:47] <Cork> that takes some cycles
[04:27:16] <Cork> but i expected it to be in the range of ~10-15%
[04:27:29] <Cork> not 100-150
[04:52:01] <granden> decx: I tried that .get().play() and my browser returns, TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating '$('#audio-'+id).get().play()')
[04:52:12] <granden> Why is that?
[04:52:26] <Cork> $('#audio-'+id)[0].play() should work
[04:54:43] <decx> right would be get(0)
[04:54:55] <DannyButterman> Hi there
[04:55:02] <untaken_> if I have a group of checkboxes with a class name of 'blah' how would I get a change event to happen on checkbox that has changed? $('.blah').change( function() { alert('hi'); } doesn't seem to work?
[04:55:03] <decx> i thought get() on a collection with one element returns just that but it's still an array
[04:55:06] <untaken_> hi DonVitoCorleone
[04:55:20] <untaken_> DannyButterman: I meant ;)
[04:55:35] <Cork> bind the click event
[04:55:36] <DannyButterman> untaken ^^
[04:55:51] <decx> change should work
[04:55:58] <decx> something is afoot
[04:56:01] <untaken_> ahh
[04:56:06] <untaken_> ok
[04:56:16] <untaken_> will setup on jsfiddle
[04:58:01] <DannyButterman> I need to implement comboboxes in a form. Seems jQuery allow that. Found documentation on the website but I can't find a short answer to my need. How should I start first with a preloaded list of choices ?
[04:59:54] <GaborM> Hi guys
[05:00:05] <granden> Cork and decx: Thanks!
[05:01:09] <wodim> kek
[05:02:06] <DannyButterman> In fact I need to do almost the same thing as  the third example in this page : http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxCombo/
[05:02:12] <DannyButterman> though it's not jquery there
[05:02:32] <decx> dhtml :D
[05:02:40] <DannyButterman> and I couldn't find how to reproduce the text high light in the doc of this js framework
[05:03:19] <GaborM> Is there a way to print out a jQuery object as HTML ?
[05:03:27] <GaborM> I mean not just the content like with .html()
[05:04:07] <decx> append the object
[05:04:10] <GaborM> Oh sorry, figured it out
[05:04:11] <Cork> Cabanossi: $(target).text($('<div>').html(jqo.clone()).html())
[05:04:33] <Cork> if you want to have the html escaped in the page
[05:04:36] <GaborM> foo.[0].outerHTML works fine
[05:04:46] <DannyButterman> combobox anyone ?
[05:04:51] <GaborM> foo[0].outerHTML*
[05:05:21] <Cork> GaborM: except a little older firefox where outerHTML doens't exist
[05:05:31] <Cork> but ya, should be fine to use i think
[05:05:50] <Cork> ff11 added support
[05:05:56] <GaborM> Cork: Yeah I'm safe with it, it's for a node-webkit app :)
[05:06:05] <decx> DannyButterman you mean an input that is a faux-selectbox with an autocomplete
[05:06:27] <Cork> GaborM: and ff pre 11 is completely eol anyway
[05:06:37] <Cork> since a long time even
[05:07:40] <GaborM> Cork: Thanks for the heads up ;)
[05:07:42] <decx> when did they stop doing point releases for ff?
[05:07:45] <DannyButterman> decx, yes I do. plus it should highlight the best match in the list. I should also be able to detect a change of value for the input.
[05:08:33] <DannyButterman> decx, really like the example I gave above
[05:08:39] <decx> well use it
[05:08:44] <decx> ^^
[05:09:02] <decx> i dont think i've seen this kind of pattern
[05:09:15] <DannyButterman> decx, I would like to, but the behaviour isn't what I need, and I can't find a way to change it.
[05:09:37] <decx> https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/combobox.html
[05:09:43] <DannyButterman> decx no google results not IRC channel for that like jQuery has
[05:10:50] <DannyButterman> decx, it's the behaviour you find in ms access, and it's very user friendly for forms
[05:11:27] <decx> ms access, now that's a name i haven't heard in a while
[05:11:56] <DannyButterman> decx ^^ I know, but it had some good ideas, like that
[05:18:56] <Kartagis> how can I target an a element of which href is foo.html?
[05:19:24] <Cork> $('a[href="foo.html"]')
[05:19:28] <decx> dont
[05:19:37] <Kartagis> decx: why?
[05:19:44] <decx> it's slow
[05:19:58] <Cork> decx: it isn't normally that slow
[05:19:59] <decx> minimize the selector footprint with a class or context and then filter out with []
[05:20:05] <Cork> it might be bad depending on where
[05:20:06] <Kartagis> decx: it's not my problem, it's client's
[05:20:09] <Cork> but normally it might be ok
[05:20:20] <decx> it's ok if you preprend the tag like you did
[05:20:36] <Kartagis> thanks Cork
[05:20:36] <decx> but context always good ^^
[05:20:37] <Cork> ah, true don't do it for "any element"
[05:22:10] <Kartagis> Cork: like element foo of which bar attribute is foobar?
[05:22:24] <Cork> Kartagis: yes
[05:22:31] <Kartagis> Cork: okay
[05:22:47] <Cork> Kartagis: though note attribute selectors needs to traverse the dom to select the elements
[05:22:50] <Cork> so it is slow
[05:23:08] <Cork> so never ever use it in preformance cortical code
[05:23:13] <Cork> *critical
[05:23:25] <Kartagis> how can I target this and that at the same time?
[05:23:37] <Cork> this and that??
[05:23:55] <decx> separate with comma $('.one,.two')
[05:24:05] <Kartagis> Cork: two separate elements that need to be treated equally
[05:24:26] <Kartagis> decx: does that work with class and id?
[05:24:34] <decx> works with all selectors
[05:24:39] <decx> like in css
[05:26:04] <DelphiWorld> back
[05:26:43] <Kartagis> I'm wondering if jQuery(".dropdown-toggle,a[href='smtc-events-calendar'") is okay
[05:27:11] <decx> not if you omit the ]
[05:27:41] <Cork> decx: actually it is in webkit :)
[05:27:50] <Cork> they auto fix that
[05:27:58] <Cork> but ya, make valid selectors ^^'
[05:28:00] <decx> blimey
[05:28:17] <Cork> someone was bit by that in here yesterday
[05:28:21] <Kartagis> argh,
[05:28:32] <Cork> "this works in ie and chrome but doens't work in firefox"
[05:28:41] <Cork> "add the missing ]"
[05:30:23] <Kartagis> hrm
[05:30:42] <Kartagis> okay, there is a menu I am trying to fix
[05:30:51] <Kartagis> I added a mouseleave event
[05:31:01] <Kartagis> and I'm adding a class
[05:31:20] <Kartagis> however, it doesn't work the first time I hover
[05:31:39] <Kartagis> should I add a mouseenter too?
[05:45:44] <Woet> is there a short snippet that will re-sort table rows based upon the numerical value on one of the columns, or should I go for a library like tablesorter / data tables even though I don't need anything they offer (like the UI)?
[05:51:56] <DelphiWorld> guys any js error in my html?
[05:51:57] <DelphiWorld> http://paste.debian.net/125349/
[05:52:59] <Woet> check your console?
[05:53:13] <Woet> we're not here to read through your code for errors
[05:53:15] <DelphiWorld> Woet: not easy for me using text to speech
[05:53:45] <DelphiWorld> Woet: the js console is not readible for screen reader users
[05:54:52] <DelphiWorld> i am doing a div inside another div, will that be a problem?
[05:55:52] <DelphiWorld> Kartagis: may you help me?
[05:55:53] <dieck> DelphiWorld: any special reason you use jquery 1.10.2 when 1.11.1 is out?
[05:56:20] <DelphiWorld> dieck: no, no reason just choused it;)
[05:57:03] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld: for future reference, paste your js on http://jsfidle.net/ and hit Hint, that will you if you have any errors
[05:57:39] <DelphiWorld> Kartagis: the issue is those web site are not designed for screen readers users
[05:57:41] <DelphiWorld> lot of lockup
[05:57:59] * Kartagis shakes fist at those
[05:58:20] <DelphiWorld> dieck: updated acording to your remarque, thank
[05:59:11] <dieck> Kartagis: http://jsfidle.net/ is a sedo parked domain to sell, though it didn't quite sounded like you were spamming :)
[05:59:31] <Kartagis> jsfiddle.net, sorry
[05:59:49] <DelphiWorld> lol
[06:00:12] <DelphiWorld> dieck: what's latest jqm version?
[06:05:38] <DelphiWorld> <div style="clear: both"></div>
[06:05:43] <DelphiWorld> what do this sinify?
[06:07:59] <DelphiWorld> wb, BillCriswell
[06:08:05] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyyyyy
[06:08:39] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell:          <div style="clear: both"></div> what do this do?
[06:09:02] <dw1> you gotta learn to google basic stuff dude
[06:09:04] <dw1> <3
[06:09:15] <Kartagis> DelphiWorld: try asking your questions without highlighting people
[06:09:23] <DelphiWorld> dw1: this is more a visual thant a textual thing
[06:09:25] <BillCriswell> It'll cause any element below it and itself to not float next to the floated elements above it.
[06:09:54] <DelphiWorld> thank BillCriswell well explained
[06:10:20] <BillCriswell> Glad I could help!
[06:10:45] <DelphiWorld> offcource you did and with a pretty well explanation
[06:15:31] <Kartagis> I have a question: I have a menu at http://smtc.com.sp-hosting.net/ and the client wants the menu items to stay white on mouseleave. I've written jQuery(".dropdown-toggle,a[href='/smtc-events-calendar']").on("mouseleave", function() {
[06:15:31] <Kartagis>     $(this).css({"background-color":"white", "color":"black"});
[06:15:31] <Kartagis> }); but it affects all menu items at once. what did I do wrong?
[06:17:31] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: No reason for js here. You can use :hover on the li to style and then since the .dropdown-menu is a child of li it'll still be while
[06:17:36] <BillCriswell> still be white*
[06:18:08] <BillCriswell> .dropdown:hover a { background-color: #fff; } for instance.
[06:18:25] <Kartagis> hmm, let me try that
[06:18:55] <Kartagis> tried asking in #css, they said javascript question
[06:20:08] <BillCriswell> Well, it technically is, but if you can avoid JS you should haha.
[06:20:52] <BillCriswell> While asking others how they'd approach something could lead to a massive headache and tons of shitty advice there's occasional diamonds in the rough.
[06:24:29] <DelphiWorld> is there any way to animate a gif while my content is loading?
[06:29:05] <decx> Woet use sort() on a collection
[06:29:10] <decx> oh i was scrolled up
[06:29:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Smooth.
[06:30:02] <decx> -.-
[06:30:33] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: it didn't work :S
[06:30:35] <decx> Woet might as well have it http://jsfiddle.net/vzpwvct8/
[06:31:12] <Kartagis> I used .dropdown-toggle:hover a {background-color:#fff; }
[06:31:16] <Woet> yea, got it working by now. the performance isn't what i was hoping for though, will have to resort to server side
[06:32:45] <DelphiWorld> i have a div
[06:32:48] <DelphiWorld> inside another  div
[06:32:56] <DelphiWorld> but i'm unable to feed it with any html
[06:32:58] <DelphiWorld> any idea?
[06:33:11] <DelphiWorld> $('#newsfeed').rssfeed('http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/oddlyEnoughNews', {
[06:33:30] <DelphiWorld> this one is feeding #newsfeed, while #newsfeed is inside a div called "news"
[06:34:22] * DelphiWorld is dumb ;(
[06:34:25] <Kartagis> $('#news') assuming the id is news
[06:34:26] <DelphiWorld> newsfeed was commanted out :S
[06:34:43] <DelphiWorld> LOL
[06:36:23] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Just came up with this, might be useful: http://jsbin.com/siqiyijiyani/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:36:24] <DelphiWorld> now another issue;(
[06:36:31] <DelphiWorld> my newsfeed display in desktop but not in mob
[06:37:13] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Looks like you're getting closer.
[06:37:30] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Now it's just an issue of specificity which you should be able to figure out.
[06:37:48] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: hrm, the thing is, color doesn't stay black :S
[06:38:00] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Yes, that's due to specificity.
[06:38:35] <BillCriswell> Look at the dev tools and you'll see .navbar-default .navbar-nav > li > a is more specific than .dropdown:hover a
[06:38:59] <BillCriswell> You can just put the :hover on the li in that selector if you want.
[06:39:06] <Kartagis> hrm
[06:39:12] <Kartagis> gotta learn more
[06:39:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah, specificity is huge.
[06:40:06] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/siqiyijiyani/1/edit?html,js,output is this to me? i dont think ;)
[06:42:23] <BillCriswell> DelphiWorld: Thought you said something about a loading div.
[06:42:45] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell: no no, that was just my div was commented out;-)
[06:42:49] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[06:47:29] <decx> is('.loading') for the aria prop clever
[06:54:55] <t0th_-> hi
[06:56:23] <BillCriswell> decx: I definitely like how it looked.
[06:56:29] <BillCriswell> Read like english.
[06:57:03] <BillCriswell> decx: Been trying to brush on my accessibility stuff lately since I tend to forget about it all the time.
[06:57:14] <BillCriswell> It's just really not fun.
[06:59:06] <decx> neither is being handicapped
[07:00:47] <BillCriswell> decx: You never know really.
[07:01:27] <untaken_> what is the best practice when you have a form in a table and there are many rows and possibly a few table input fields in the td's? if I click submit, how would each row for each worked out backend? The obvious is having input tag names like mycheckbox_123 where 123 is an id. Is there a better way of doing this?
[07:02:27] <thin> I have a simple progress bar script that checks if 10 images have loaded. I have another script that creates a slideshow after window.load. How can I replace using window.load with a custom jquery event triggered at the end of my progress bar script?
[07:02:40] <BillCriswell> untaken_: You can use an array.
[07:03:06] <untaken_> BillCriswell: and these can be accessed with Jquery still with ease?
[07:03:30] <andrew9184_> thin, you can use jQuery.trigger to trigger custom events
[07:04:02] <thin> But what would be the code that replaces $( window ).load( function(){…});
[07:04:06] <andrew9184_> Gevox: how are you getting this file ?
[07:04:15] <BillCriswell> untaken_: You can use a class to get at them, but would you ever need to just like... get item[1259][name] for no reason?
[07:04:29] <thin> $( ??? ) .?custom_event?( function ) ?
[07:04:43] <andrew9184_> theres no code that replaces window.load
[07:04:52] <andrew9184_> you would possibly register the event listener inside window.load
[07:04:57] <decx> why trigger an event, just have a callback in your image loader
[07:05:05] <Jon30> does anybody know where i can find a gallery/slideshow similar to the one they are using in wikipedia? for example, click on the friends image on the right and a full size gallery slideshow will open: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends
[07:05:07] <andrew9184_> to avoid callback hell :)
[07:05:10] <untaken_> BillCriswell: sounds fair enough, I'll explore them. Thanks
[07:05:14] <decx> same principle
[07:05:32] <andrew9184_> i like event listening, its cleaner imo
[07:05:54] <andrew9184_> ie if you wanted something else to also happen when that event is trigger, you have many functions into that callback
[07:05:56] <BillCriswell> untaken_: No problem.
[07:06:15] <decx> but a custom trigger will just call a function anyway
[07:06:15] <Gevox> andrew9184_ i'd like to get it from url, you paste the url and i'll create thumbnail of it and have object the image as file, so i can upload it as file
[07:06:22] <thin> andrew9184_: because not all browsers trigger an image load event when they load an image from their cache. So, in the event my progress bar makes it to 100% I want to trigger the slideshow. But also in the event the progress bar never reaches 100% I still want window.load to create the slideshow as a backup
[07:06:29] <thin> but right now I’m just trying to explore how cusom events work
[07:06:36] <Gevox> andrew9184_ i googled alot, i think its not possible
[07:07:09] <decx> googled alot *chuckle*
[07:08:01] <andrew9184_> thin: are you using imagesLoaded ?
[07:11:57] * kevin waves
[07:12:25] <thin> andrew9184_: no I’m using a super simple script I wrote myself
[07:13:04] <thin> Is $(window).trigger(‘my-custom-even’); something that I can do?
[07:13:33] <BillCriswell> thin: Yup.
[07:13:38] <Nhygui> hello guys!!
[07:13:47] <thin> and then wrap my slideshow code in $(window).on(‘my-custom-event’, function{} )?
[07:14:15] <thin> ?
[07:15:02] <andrew9184_> yup
[07:15:52] <BillCriswell> That can work.
[07:15:56] <Nhygui> http://jsfiddle.net/k2xxxzup/
[07:16:15] <Nhygui> Ihave a problem with the content that load when the user click for to change the content
[07:16:38] <Nhygui> The onload content is resizable but the second is rigid
[07:19:11] <Nhygui> http://i.imgur.com/H5t4ZU1.png
[07:19:31] <Nhygui> The yellow background in this case doesn't resize
[07:20:50] <Nhygui> and here works perfect
[07:20:51] <Nhygui> http://i.imgur.com/6PZ051Y.png
[07:21:03] <Nhygui> I need that content will be resizable
[07:26:57] <Nhygui> someone can help me or think which can to be the problem?
[08:02:38] <Respek> so the guy yesterday: http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[08:13:01] <ThKo> Hi guys, I’ve got one *.html file which contains 4 different div data-role … When I link from data-role X to data-role Y, is it possible to transfer a variable to the second one? Thank you for your hints :-)
[08:13:20] <dmsuperman> "link from data-role X to data-role Y" what do you mean by that
[08:13:30] <dmsuperman> when you link from one page to another?
[08:13:33] <dmsuperman> you can use the query string for that
[08:14:21] <ThKo> <a href="#questions" data-icon="check">Fragen</a> For example…I’m using jquery mobile…My thought is now something like this: <a href="#questions“.myVar data-icon="check">Fragen</a>
[08:14:26] <ThKo> Sorry for linking :D
[08:14:51] <dmsuperman> so you're linking within the same page?
[08:15:12] <dmsuperman> how do you intend to use the variables?
[08:15:59] <dmsuperman> what does "transfer a variable to the second one" mean exactly?
[08:16:35] <ThKo> Yes. For example…I’ve got a listview with 20 questions in it…When I click on first question it opens a new data-role=„page“ in the same document. Now I’ve to make a query to my sqlite database to get the values of question with id 1 for example
[08:16:52] <ThKo> Where id which contains the number 1 is the transfered variable :)
[08:18:13] <dmsuperman> what do you mean by "it opens a new data-role="page" ?
[08:19:24] <ThKo> Mom, I’ll paste the code
[08:19:42] <dmsuperman> oh you mean with jquery mobile where it scrolls to the given node with an id matcing the href of the link
[08:20:02] <dmsuperman> how do you expect to use the variables? you don't have any javscript to switch between the pages
[08:20:21] <dmsuperman> so there would be no javascript which fires to run your sqlite query
[08:20:33] <ThKo> http://pastebin.com/PXbHMTP4
[08:20:52] <dmsuperman> please use jsfiddle so they're actual working examples. but anyway, I see no javascript here
[08:21:14] <dmsuperman> so it sounds like you need to first figure out how you're going to fire a sqlite query when you switch "pages"
[08:21:27] <ThKo> Yep, but for example:
[08:21:52] <ThKo> Is there a way like in php blabla.com?id=234&make=true for transfering variables in jquery mobile?
[08:22:05] <ThKo> Maybe I think to complicated
[08:22:37] <dmsuperman> again, transfer to *what*
[08:22:46] <dmsuperman> I don't see any code that would execute to be able to receive those variables
[08:23:25] <dmsuperman> how you're executing the code is going to influence how we pass it variables
[08:25:45] <ThKo> Ok I understand. I’ve found a way… <a href="second.html?paremeter=123" data-role="button">Send parameter</a> and then grab the variable by $(this).data("url").split("?")[1]; … Maybe not the best solution, but works
[08:25:49] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: ping
[08:25:59] <dmsuperman> where are you getting $(this) then?
[08:26:02] <BillCriswell> POONGNGG
[08:26:12] <dmsuperman> that still requires you to execute javascript that you still haven't shown me
[08:27:04] <ThKo> Something like this: $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', "#index", function (event, data) {
[08:27:13] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: what you said I could type affected the dropdown items as well, so I thought I'd target a[href="#"] instead of a
[08:27:15] <Valduare> hi guys im new to jquery   how do I change this to differenciate it from anotehr script $(document).ready(function() {
[08:27:49] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: I'd need to see what you're doing.
[08:28:00] <BillCriswell> You shouldn't have to target things by attributes like that.
[08:28:23] <Kartagis> Valduare: that's the way to execute stuff when the page loading is complete
[08:28:49] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: http://smtc.com.sp-hosting.net/
[08:28:59] <Valduare> hmm. I have some php that has a while loop to build different divs   and a script within the while but one of the scripts is overriding the other
[08:29:25] <Kartagis> targeting a was affecting dropdowns too
[08:29:35] <dmsuperman> ThKo: I doubt that $(this) will refer to the <a> tag in that event
[08:29:41] <Valduare> I tried changing the id of the dives in the different while loops and the different scripts so they only affected the specific divs but its still overriding
[08:29:48] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: What's the issue here?
[08:30:06] <dmsuperman> ThKo: you're changing your story though, before it was 2 pages within the same HTML document. Now you're linking to external files?
[08:30:20] <ThKo> dmsuperman: Yep I see my mistake
[08:30:31] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: the client was asking that the menu item should stay white on mouseleave
[08:30:51] <BillCriswell> That looks like it's happening.
[08:31:01] <Kartagis> so you said I should target .navbar-something > li:hover a
[08:31:04] <dmsuperman> If you're linking to a true external file which changes the URL in the browser, you can use the query string as you have it, then access it via "location.search"
[08:31:20] <Kartagis> but that was affecting submenus as well
[08:31:44] <Kartagis> so I thought I'd target a[href="#"]
[08:32:05] <dmsuperman> ThKo: if you're linking to a sub-page within the document, I doubt you can access the <a> tag from within the pagebeforeshow event. in which case why aren't you just putting the variables right into the pages themselves?
[08:32:55] <hlvwrk> nobody was answering this question in jqueryui-dev... figured I'd ask it here.
[08:32:56] <hlvwrk> question. I'm trying to load a custom jquerymobile build, and create a flip toggle switch on a form... it isn't working. Is there anything I need to do outside of loading jQuery, jQuery.Mobile.custom.js, the two stylesheets, and creating the form element (<input data-role="flipswitch" name="flip-checkbox-1" id="flip-checkbox-1" type="checkbox">)?
[08:33:14] <Valduare> Kartagis: any idea?
[08:33:15] <ThKo> I think at the moment i miss the forest for the trees. :-)
[08:33:55] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: You can do .navbar-something > li:hover > a to only target the first level lis.
[08:34:17] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: that was what I did
[08:36:02] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: I see li:hover a[href="#"] in your stylesheet. li:hover > a would get the same thing and give you the liberty to make those links actually go somewhere without touching your CSS later.
[08:36:31] <Kartagis> Valduare: sorry no. probably version conflict
[08:36:44] <Valduare> im very new- what do you mean version conflict
[08:37:16] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: look again now?
[08:37:26] <Kartagis> Valduare: jquery versions
[08:37:35] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: You don't have the :hover
[08:37:39] <Valduare> oh no its one jquery.
[08:37:59] <Valduare> I am using jquery.qrcode to generate a qr barcode for individual divs   in a php while loop
[08:38:10] <Kartagis> .navbar-default > li:hover > a {color:#000;background-color:#fff;}
[08:38:12] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: If the attribut eseletor way is working for you go for it though haha.
[08:38:25] <Kartagis> this is my line
[08:38:27] <Valduare> so im feeding php variables to the jquery.qrcode script to generate unique qr codes.
[08:39:10] <Valduare> problem is, it seems that once the first time it parses through the php while loop and runs the script. that qr code that was generated is used for every subsequent div
[08:40:04] <hlvwrk> Hallllllllo.
[08:41:05] <Valduare> wait i may have figured it out hah
[08:41:11] <ThKo> dmsuperman: Got it…Now I think this is the solution: http://jsfiddle.net/phillpafford/VXV3R/
[08:42:25] <Valduare> now onto next problem lol
[08:42:53] <hlvwrk> Question! When building a custom jQueryMobile package... what would be required to get the flip toggle switch widget functioning correctly? I can't seem to get it to display at all on my site.
[08:48:23] <hlvwrk> Eh.
[08:48:31] <hlvwrk> Anybody able to help with jQuery mobile woes?
[08:49:13] <ThKo> Ask your question ;)
[08:49:20] <hlvwrk> I did twice.
[08:50:05] <trewd6> how can I select these elements but with a parent class of .classGeneric $("#input1, #input2, #input3)
[08:50:18] <ThKo> Sorry, didn’t see it :)
[08:51:18] <hlvwrk> I'll try again. I'm trying to create a custom jquery mobile package that includes the flipswitch widget. Not a whole lot else. Are there any required items on the custom build that I need to check in order for jQuery Mobile to properly initialize? Also -- the package outputs the custom.js, a structure.css, and a theme.css.
[08:51:54] <hlvwrk> Is there anything I need to do in order to initialize the widget outside of simply adding in the input with the data type as seen on the site?
[08:52:10] <trewd6> how can I optimize this selector? $(".classGeneric #input1, .classGeneric #input2, .classGeneric #input3")
[08:52:21] <robertmaxrees> trewd6 drop the classes.
[08:52:31] <robertmaxrees> '#input1, #input2, #input3
[08:52:39] <trewd6> I need the class though
[08:52:45] <robertmaxrees> no you don't.
[08:53:00] <trewd6> robertmaxrees: with what I'm doing, I do.
[08:53:01] <hlvwrk> Why? You'll never have two of the same id's on the same page
[08:53:05] <robertmaxrees> IDs must be unique to each page - if you're repeating them, you need to fix that.
[08:53:18] <robertmaxrees> there should be no case where you ever have to target an ID through anything else.
[08:53:36] <hlvwrk> if anything, you should reverse them like robertmaxrees is saying. ID = not shared. Classes = shared.
[08:53:43] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[08:54:13] <hlvwrk> #PAGEID .targetInput
[08:54:15] <hlvwrk> etc.
[08:55:30] <hlvwrk> you could always...
[08:56:06] <trewd6> I am dealing with an existing framework that uses modals and shared ID's across elements
[08:56:23] <hlvwrk> shared ID's.
[08:56:25] * hlvwrk shudders
[08:56:26] <trewd6> and selectors are done .class #input
[08:56:47] <robertmaxrees> what framework is this?
[08:57:09] <robertmaxrees> because the reason you have to select like that is a munge - you have to limit the parent scope because IDs cannot be replicated on a page.
[08:57:20] <bakers> I want to call a given function foo() everytime a new element with class bar appears in the DOM. Can I use .live() for that?
[08:57:32] <hlvwrk> I'll try again. I'm trying to create a custom jquery mobile package that includes the flipswitch widget. Not a whole lot else. Are there any required items on the custom build that I need to check in order for jQuery Mobile to properly initialize? Also -- the package outputs the custom.js, a structure.css, and a theme.css. Is there anything I need to do in order to initialize
[08:57:32] <hlvwrk> the widget outside of simply adding in the input with the data type as seen on the site? The flip switches don't seem to show up at all.
[08:58:03] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk showing us what you have so far would be helpful.
[08:58:06] <robertmaxrees> bakers no.
[08:58:16] <hlvwrk> One sec.
[08:58:20] <robertmaxrees> bakers you'd need to use a mutation observer, but even that's poorly supported and hacky.
[08:58:41] <robertmaxrees> bakers instead, use a callback of some kind in the function creating elements.
[08:58:49] <Jon30> does anybody know where i can find a gallery/slideshow similar to the one they are using in wikipedia? for example, click on the friends image on the right and a full size gallery slideshow will open: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends
[08:59:50] <robertmaxrees> Jon30 https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-MultimediaViewer is what they're using.
[09:00:27] <Jon30> robertmaxrees: awesome! thanks
[09:01:17] <robertmaxrees> Jon30 i just inspected the carousel and searched the container's classname - that repo came up.
[09:01:39] <Jon30> robertmaxrees: this doesn't look easy to integrate into a website hmm
[09:01:51] <robertmaxrees> Jon30 probably not ;) it's apart of the mediawiki dealio.
[09:02:34] <robertmaxrees> just pick any carousel and use css to override some of the basic styles to get what you're looking for.
[09:04:01] <Uhkis> Jon30: try this? http://www.plusgallery.net/
[09:04:34] <hlvwrk> http://jsfiddle.net/s2rmh84k/
[09:04:38] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees: ^
[09:04:39] <Jon30> Uhkis: thanks :))
[09:05:08] <hlvwrk> Not sure what else is even needed here. The jquery mobile docs just say to add in the data-role and it will do the rest
[09:05:32] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk so you're tyring to understand what dependencies you need?
[09:06:04] <hlvwrk> Yes. That, and if I'm missing anything that might be needed to initialize the switch
[09:06:21] <no_gravity> anybody who likes/dislikes jqueryui.com ?
[09:06:32] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity that's a generic question.  what about it?
[09:06:43] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees: I hate the burnt orange.
[09:07:07] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: im looking for a rangeslider and wonder if jqueryui is a good solution.
[09:07:21] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity i'd just use nouislider if that's all you need.
[09:07:29] <robertmaxrees> don't load the entire library if you need one small part.
[09:08:00] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees:  see anything up with my fiddle?
[09:08:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking duder.
[09:08:19] <robertmaxrees> patience.
[09:08:21] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: is that the slider part  of jqueryui? or different code?
[09:08:25] <hlvwrk> sorry. ;)
[09:08:30] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity different code, but looks similar.
[09:08:45] <hlvwrk> no_gravity: would you use anything else from jquery ui?
[09:08:58] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk did you click the "flipswitch" option in the download builder?
[09:09:05] <hlvwrk> yep.
[09:09:19] <robertmaxrees> and you also grabbed the imageS?
[09:09:29] <Kartagis> hrm
[09:09:33] <no_gravity> hlvwrk: dunno
[09:09:44] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees: there were no images.
[09:09:44] <hlvwrk> it's all css.
[09:09:45] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: the nouislider looks a bit big
[09:09:55] <shoky> hlvwrk that jquery-ui is too old
[09:09:57] <hlvwrk> no_gravity: it can be restyled.
[09:10:04] <no_gravity> hlvwrk: probably
[09:10:09] <hlvwrk> shoky: which jquery UI would I need to update it to?
[09:10:17] <dmsuperman> ThKo: why are you passing the variables through the link instead of generating them when the page loads?
[09:10:19] <shoky> a new one, i donno
[09:11:03] <hlvwrk> erm
[09:11:22] <robertmaxrees> shoky he's having issues with the flipswitch in jqm.  that needs jqui, too?
[09:11:39] <shoky> no idea, i just saw the console error
[09:11:43] <no_gravity> hlvwrk: but on the page it does not tell you how
[09:11:58] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity your web developer tools.
[09:12:01] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity that's how we did it.
[09:12:29] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: what?
[09:12:30] <Kartagis> I'm trying to change a slider direction on a site, but the included bootstrap js doesn't have carousell stuff. what do I do?
[09:13:01] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity are you familiar with your browser's developer tools?
[09:13:23] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:13:36] <no_gravity> jesus, nouislider consists of 13 js files.
[09:13:45] <robertmaxrees> it should only be one.
[09:14:02] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/leongersen/noUiSlider/tree/master/src/js
[09:14:17] <robertmaxrees> erm, that's not where you donwload from.
[09:14:20] <robertmaxrees> http://refreshless.com/nouislider/download/
[09:14:29] <robertmaxrees> pick ONE of the JS and ONE of the CSS files.
[09:14:31] <robertmaxrees> not all of them.
[09:14:39] <robertmaxrees> you're looking at the files before it gets built.
[09:15:08] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: hmm...
[09:16:00] <robertmaxrees> that'll be smaller than including all of jquery ui to get one feature.
[09:16:12] <no_gravity> robertmaxrees: i prefer to download from github, so i can see what i download. dont like to download zip files.
[09:16:29] <robertmaxrees> no_gravity https://github.com/leongersen/noUiSlider/tree/master/distribute
[09:16:32] <no_gravity> zip files are so 1990
[09:16:34] <robertmaxrees> then dl from here.
[09:16:37] <robertmaxrees> LMAO
[09:16:38] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:16:48] <robertmaxrees> which is why jqueryui and jqm use them for downloads ;)
[09:18:27] <robertmaxrees> and btw, that zip file comes from github anyway, so it shouldn't be a big deal.
[09:20:32] <Kartagis> I'm trying to change a carousel direction on a site, but the included bootstrap js doesn't have carousell stuff. what do I do?
[09:20:41] <hlvwrk> shoky: updated to 1.11
[09:20:42] <hlvwrk> still same thing.
[09:20:44] <hlvwrk> http://jsfiddle.net/s2rmh84k/1/
[09:20:44] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that question doesn't really make sense.
[09:21:02] <hlvwrk> There has to be a reason why the toggleswitch doesn't initalize.
[09:21:37] <shoky> hlvwrk my guess is you're not including the right files.. but donno which you need ;p
[09:21:52] <shoky> and you don't need jquery-ui there at all, probably
[09:22:11] <hlvwrk> we have UI on the site for other purposes. I was just trying to mirror our setup
[09:22:39] <hlvwrk> as far as not including the right files. the custom package only outputs a single J
[09:22:42] <hlvwrk> JS* and two CSS files.
[09:22:45] <hlvwrk> I included them.
[09:22:52] * hlvwrk :('s
[09:22:54] <shoky> no idea what this custom package is
[09:23:21] <robertmaxrees> if I init it manually it works, soooo.
[09:23:22] <hlvwrk> I'm basically just trying to get the toggleswitch widget and swipe events
[09:23:28] <robertmaxrees> there's something else going one.
[09:23:29] <Ansikt> Hi.  What is a way to extend a jquery promise to return a nested promise?  For example:
[09:23:50] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s2rmh84k/2/
[09:23:55] <shoky> hlvwrk and you need a custom package for that?
[09:24:07] <hlvwrk> shoky, yes. all of the standalones i've found have SUCKED.
[09:24:25] <shoky> also:  http://jsfiddle.net/s2rmh84k/3/
[09:24:35] <shoky> no custom package there
[09:24:39] <hlvwrk> HM..
[09:24:45] <hlvwrk> that's the entire package.
[09:24:50] <hlvwrk> so I must have missed something.
[09:24:51] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk did you see mine?
[09:24:58] <robertmaxrees> it you just have to manually init it.
[09:25:01] <shoky> that's jquery-mobile, nothing custom
[09:25:03] <robertmaxrees> no idea why, but it's whgat you want.
[09:25:04] <hlvwrk> I did robertmaxrees. Maybe I missed the inits on the custom?
[09:25:09] <robertmaxrees> no clue
[09:25:18] <hlvwrk> Thank you!
[09:25:19] <hlvwrk> :)
[09:25:19] <Ansikt> If a user is creating a new foobar on my site, they call the newFoobar function and it returns a jqXHR.  Normally this is just the result of $.ajax() to my new foobar endpoint.  However, if they already have a foobar, I need to call the delete endpoint AND THEN the new endpoint.  How do I return a jqXHR object which references the .done() of both?
[09:27:00] <shoky> return $.ajax(..).then(function(data) { return $.ajax(..) });
[09:27:19] <shoky> Ansikt ^
[09:27:39] <Ansikt> would that really work?  Wouldn't  it just return the first one?
[09:28:05] <Ansikt> because the .then function is called async...so that return wouldn't go into the return value of the first one.
[09:28:37] <shoky> .then returns a new promise
[09:29:07] <shoky> takes care of it for you. it should work fine, if i understood what you need
[09:29:54] <Ansikt> shoky: You do, and from the docs, that looks correct!
[09:29:56] <ciqsteve> Q: I need to request 3 objects via ajax that I need to come back in the order requested.  I don't believe $(myel).each( $.ajax ) provides any assurance as the order of how things are returned.  I feel like what I need to do is chain the calls, but I'm not sure how... any help?
[09:29:57] <Ansikt> +1 shoky
[09:30:21] <Ansikt> ciqsteve: You are literally asking the same thing I was...ha!
[09:30:29] <Ansikt> ciqsteve: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[09:30:38] <shoky> heh
[09:30:39] <Ansikt> look at the last example
[09:30:47] <ciqsteve> Ansikt.. that's funny
[09:30:49] <P0rk> How do I select all "required" fields in a form? $("input").filter(function (){return $(this).attr("required")?$(this):null;}); seems ugly
[09:31:19] <Ansikt> P0rk: $('[required]')
[09:31:21] <ciqsteve> thanks for the link!
[09:32:06] <BillCriswell> P0rk: You'd just have to return true from that filter. `return $(this).prop('required');` would do the trick, but Ansikt might be a little better for you.
[09:32:20] <P0rk> I knew it was that easy. Thanks. Couldn't quite get the syntax right.
[09:32:32] <NoiseEee> i'd make Ansikt's selector a little more precise though, so your script isnt searching through the whle document
[09:32:39] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[09:32:57] <P0rk> so .map you have to return the element, correct? Filter is just true/null?
[09:33:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah I was thinking of just feeling that selector to filter
[09:34:01] <robertmaxrees> if you already have all the inputs selected, using .filter() on that can be nice, too.
[09:34:06] <robertmaxrees> so you're only working with those specific inputs.
[09:34:12] <BillCriswell> P0rk: truthy/falsy I'd imagine. not positive though... better to be clear and just do bool in my opinion
[09:34:51] <P0rk> I'm running through a form and adding icons to it. Required Icon for required fields. Hidden valid and error icons, etc.
[09:35:31] <P0rk> clear and revert icons on input fields. yuck
[09:36:45] <P0rk> I wish there was a parent selector in css.
[09:37:50] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: I was trying to incorporate http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16877562/twitter-bootstrap-carousel-cycle-items-right-to-left-rtl-reversed
[09:38:18] <BillCriswell> P0rk: It's coming, but doubt it'll be useable soon.
[09:38:37] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis but it's not using bootstrap, sooo... how can we help in this case?
[09:38:37] <BillCriswell> P0rk: You can google :has()
[09:38:56] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: it's not?
[09:39:16] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis thought you said it's not.
[09:40:19] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to find out what the source is, then. could you take a look?
[09:41:35] <geri> hi someone here with internet explorer?
[09:42:00] <P0rk> for attributes that should never change, do you still use .prop("id")? or is .attr("id") okay?\
[09:42:01] <robertmaxrees> geri lots of folks - you can also download a vm to look yourself.
[09:42:07] <robertmaxrees> P0rk always use .prop() for attributes.
[09:42:09] <robertmaxrees> never .attr()
[09:42:17] <P0rk> why does .attr() exist?
[09:42:20] <geri> robertmaxrees: its not for free
[09:42:32] <robertmaxrees> geri yes it is.
[09:42:34] <P0rk> thanks for the input. Will do, robertmaxrees

[09:45:22] <geri> can you test it without jquery?
[09:45:35] <Kartagis> there is an error here reported by jsfiddle. looks fine, but still...
[09:46:01] <geri> i mean jsfiddle
[09:46:21] <geri> it didnt work without jsfiddle
[09:47:39] <P0rk> if I store a function in an elements data-help attribute, does the function only get executed when the attribute is checked?
[09:47:56] <NoiseEee> why would you store a function there?
[09:48:17] <NoiseEee> why would it ever be executed when checked, even if you did?
[09:48:23] <P0rk> $(".someElement").data("Help",function() {displayHelp($(this));});
[09:48:29] <NoiseEee> no.
[09:48:33] <P0rk> grr.
[09:48:36] <NoiseEee> not the way to do it
[09:48:42] <shoky> that's not a data-help attribute
[09:48:52] <shoky> .data() never writes to any attribute, ever
[09:49:08] <P0rk> sorry. THanks for the clarification.
[09:49:11] <shoky> it's an in-memory cache. fine to store a function there. it will get executed when you call it.
[09:49:19] <NoiseEee> $(".someElement").on('click',function() { someEventHandler(); })
[09:49:54] <NoiseEee> i just don't see how it's too helpful, especially when trying to make sense of the code 4 days later
[09:50:01] <P0rk> NoiseEee, that's not going to work. It's not only onClick that I need to access the function...it's got a lot of hooks
[09:50:34] <NoiseEee> P0rk: you're free to set up as many event handlers as you wish
[09:50:44] <geri> robertmaxrees: can you test it like that? http://ideone.com/l9PGRV
[09:50:52] <P0rk> I am trying to work around the fact that you can't assign functions to elements like $("element").showHelp();
[09:50:59] <NoiseEee> just think about coming back to this code, handing it to others, how your IDE will make/not make sense of it, how you can re-use functions etc P0rk
[09:51:22] <NoiseEee> P0rk: you can certainly add a function call to showHelp(), no ?
[09:51:32] <NoiseEee> (if you have access to that function source)
[09:52:05] <P0rk> I was hoping to have multiple implementations of the "help" function all accessible through data-help.
[09:52:16] <P0rk> sorry .data("help")
[09:53:14] <P0rk> so, an error class would have different help features than a valid class or a blank class and accessing the same .data('help') for each would make it easy to determine which help element to show...
[09:54:15] <NoiseEee> <someElement data-help="somethingForAFunctionToUseAndReferenceThisParticularThing">  ?
[09:54:36] <NoiseEee> one function that acts upon whatever data in the data-help attribute?
[09:54:38] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[09:54:50] <NoiseEee> anyways... maybe pastebin some code or something, but think about the long-term consequences of what you're trying to do
[09:55:25] <robertmaxrees> wait, are they trying to like prescribe which function shoudl be used for which elements through their html or something?
[09:56:23] <geri> robertmaxrees: ?
[09:56:42] <robertmaxrees> geri sorry was away - what's up?
[09:56:56] <geri> robertmaxrees: i thought you power up the vm?
[09:57:07] <robertmaxrees> geri i was in a standup.  i can do that now.
[09:57:11] <robertmaxrees> or you could do it.
[09:57:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:57:21] <geri> robertmaxrees: i already tested it before
[09:57:40] <robertmaxrees> maybe i'm not sure what you're expecting to happen vs. what's actually happening.
[09:58:58] <robertmaxrees> ah I see it now.
[09:59:10] <geri> robertmaxrees: it doesnt work correct?
[09:59:23] <robertmaxrees> not the same way across every browser no.
[09:59:34] <geri> so its an issue of IE 10?
[09:59:46] <geri> i would like to know the workaround :D
[09:59:51] <robertmaxrees> and firefox ;)
[10:00:01] <geri> what about firefox?
[10:00:02] <robertmaxrees> they'
[10:00:06] <robertmaxrees> *they all work a little differently.

[10:00:46] <shoky> "As a bonus, the options don’t even show up in ie when in an iframe."
[10:00:47] <geri> how can i fix it?
[10:01:00] <robertmaxrees> shim
[10:01:01] <shoky> don't use ie10?
[10:01:07] <robertmaxrees> or don't worry about it.
[10:01:14] <geri> shoky: im not the user :D
[10:01:24] <geri> but there are users using IE10...
[10:01:28] <shoky> user with an old browser will not see the datalist..
[10:01:37] <geri> switch back to html4?
[10:01:43] <shoky> they'll still see the input
[10:01:58] <geri> switch back to html4?
[10:02:01] <robertmaxrees> geri use another input type or write/use a polyfill.
[10:02:01] <shoky> what?
[10:02:03] <geri> for the combobox?
[10:02:18] <geri> other input type?
[10:02:37] <robertmaxrees> sure - design it differently.  or find a widget or something ot use instead.
[10:04:02] <geri> which input type can i use?
[10:04:43] <robertmaxrees> whatever you want - you'll have to redesign in that case.
[10:05:07] <geri> but i want a combo box!
[10:05:31] <robertmaxrees> lol i don't know how to help you then - you either get to use a widget/polyfill, or change your design.
[10:05:35] <thin> How do I test if a variable has not been created?
[10:05:41] <robertmaxrees> thin if (variable)
[10:06:02] <geri> robertmaxrees: widget/polyfill?
[10:06:31] <ThKo> dmsuperman: Hi, still present? I think I’ve collect one’s thoughts ;D http://jsfiddle.net/kt0d9dkp/ Here’s my code. cid is alway undefined…pagechange instead of pageinit doesn’t fire…Any hints for me? :-) Thanks and sry for highlighting ;-) :-)
[10:06:44] <robertmaxrees> geri what about that doesn't make sense?
[10:07:18] <geri> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/p2rhhwub/ what about this?
[10:08:01] <robertmaxrees> don't use onChange in your html.
[10:08:37] <geri> robertmaxrees: but its html4....
[10:08:47] <thin> if( sjss ){ alert(7) }else{ alert(9) }
[10:08:50] <robertmaxrees> geri i think you're confused about what that means.
[10:08:55] <thin> reference error
[10:09:09] <geri> robertmaxrees: the other combobox was html5 code!
[10:09:11] <robertmaxrees> it's all HTML5 - you need to use event binding in javascript.
[10:09:25] <robertmaxrees> geri the version of html is defined in your doctype.
[10:09:34] <geri> robertmaxrees: ok
[10:09:58] <robertmaxrees> thin  if (sjss) {
[10:09:58] <robertmaxrees>  	alert(7)

[10:10:05] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[10:10:53] <ThKo> thin: use something like if( typeof var != ‚undefined‘ )
[10:11:02] <robertmaxrees> i just pasted a fiddle for that >.>
[10:11:19] <robertmaxrees> or declare the variable and set it as needed.
[10:12:20] <geri> robertmaxrees: what should i use instead onchanged?
[10:12:35] <robertmaxrees> geri bind in your javascript.  jquery makes it easy.

[10:19:37] <geri> robertmaxrees: better like this? http://jsfiddle.net/x2s1j0qf/
[10:20:26] <robertmaxrees> geri erm, that's not how you use jsfiddle, but ok.
[10:20:39] <geri> what do you mean?
[10:21:17] <robertmaxrees> geri http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x2s1j0qf/1/
[10:21:23] <robertmaxrees> there are checkboxes for those things.
[10:21:39] <geri> whats the difference? :D
[10:22:07] <robertmaxrees> rather http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x2s1j0qf/2/
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> the checkboxes make it easier...
[10:22:22] <P0rk> How do you guys determine what to include in markup and what to add by jquery...I don't want to discuss the relative merits of preparing for a javascript-less browser...assume jquery WILL work
[10:22:42] <geri> robertmaxrees: still cant see any difference....
[10:22:44] <P0rk> I was thinking that the extra adornments like icons for every field would be better added by jquery?
[10:22:57] <robertmaxrees> geri it's the easier/better way to use jsfiddle
[10:23:11] <geri> yeah but whats better?
[10:23:11] <robertmaxrees> P0rk i do everything I can via markup and use javascript/jquery to power the interactive, dynamic stuff.
[10:23:24] <geri> it see prints the same to the console
[10:23:25] <robertmaxrees> geri you're using the tools built into jsfiddle to accomplish what you were trying to do.
[10:23:37] <P0rk> ugg. In a form of 100 fields, that's 1000 lines of fluff

[10:52:36] <petey> Anyone have any idea why scrollTop would change the value OR not scroll to the correct value?
[10:52:44] <petey> scrollTop works second time I click it, but doesn't scroll to the proper element the first time
[10:53:32] <gabriel_schulhof> hlvwrk: Regarding your question about flipswitch: Are you including the init module in your custom build?
[10:53:45] <hlvwrk> I didn't I figured out that
[10:53:51] <hlvwrk> without it, I needed to manually init :P
[10:54:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep. That's right. Good work!
[10:54:43] <hlvwrk> Spent wayyyyy too long this morning trying to figure that out ;)
[10:55:00] <BillCriswell> petey: Are you loading images that affect the layout?
[10:55:20] <petey> BillCriswell, what do you mean? I am loading one large image, there are points on that image I need to scroll to
[10:55:30] <gabriel_schulhof> hlvwrk: Hmmm ... maybe we should document that better ...
[10:55:39] <petey> Even after complete page load, scrollTop changes
[10:55:52] <BillCriswell> petey: Can you set up a demo somewhere?
[10:56:02] <petey> BillCriswell, sure let me try
[10:56:34] <BillCriswell> I feel like you're not waiting for the image to load before trying to scroll. That's just my gut though.
[10:58:12] <petey> BillCriswell - what about even after image has loaded scrollTop changes?
[10:58:34] <mdev> <select id="test" disabled>
[10:58:41] <BillCriswell> If things are expanding and changing the position on the page it would happen.
[10:58:41] <mdev> how I set/remove that disabled thing
[10:58:51] <mdev> tried various things but have failed thus far
[10:58:55] <robertmaxrees> mdev .prop('disabled', true) will enable it.
[10:59:02] <BillCriswell> I could be misunderstanding something though petey so make a small demo.
[10:59:06] <robertmaxrees> .prop('disabled', false) will turn that off.
[10:59:25] <mdev> thanks
[11:02:17] <petey> BillCriswell, it's an angular app, still putting together a demo
[11:02:18] <petey> http://plnkr.co/edit/GZtTkAOyN8jZjIiRu0Xv
[11:02:37] <petey> under 'goToScroll' is where the issues lie
[11:02:40] <daynaskully> {Q} can i use a click on #element1 to send a click to #element2 (element 2 is layered under something and is part of a 3rd party app i can't control)
[11:02:56] <robertmaxrees> daynaskully sure - $('#element2').trigger()
[11:03:03] <robertmaxrees> *trigger('click')
[11:03:07] <daynaskully> thanks
[11:03:09] <robertmaxrees> assuming they used jquery on it.
[11:03:18] <daynaskully> i'll try it out
[11:04:51] <petey> Oh BillCriswell - you know what the issue is? The issue is that my body,html is set to h,w 100%
[11:05:03] <petey> The container I have this stuff in is overflow-y: scroll
[11:05:03] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[11:05:14] <petey> so the offset and position change because of me scrolling in the div
[11:05:23] <petey> So I need to solve the issue of scrolling inside a parent div
[11:09:53] <joespeakeasy> Can anyone point me in the right direction? I'm binding future textarea elements to autocompelete like this: $(document).on('focus.autocomplete', ".autocomplete-me", function () {}
[11:10:11] <robertmaxrees> bind further down than document, but that's the basic idea.
[11:10:48] <joespeakeasy> The elements are created with .clone. They appear on the dom, and they work with the autocomplete, but the autocomplete data actually appears across previous textarea elements.
[11:10:54] <joespeakeasy> okay… I'll try that.
[11:11:02] <robertmaxrees> that won't fix that issue.
[11:11:14] <joespeakeasy> is it the clone?
[11:11:21] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your code in the listener isn't right.  can you share that?
[11:11:33] <joespeakeasy> yes. absolutely.
[11:13:22] <Respek> Hi all :) lovely day here in MA, hope all of yours are as well!
[11:18:17] <decx> everyones so exultant about how lovely the day is, somebody has had to have rain. we hat 23°C/74°F and sun in germany as well
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> we want rain here.
[11:18:34] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a great day for us.
[11:18:38] <decx> "has had to have" is that right?
[11:18:46] <decx> seems riduculous
[11:18:56] <robertmaxrees> *has to have had rain
[11:19:04] <robertmaxrees> and not at all - we're in the middle of a huge drought
[11:19:09] <decx> doesnt look that much better -.-
[11:19:19] <decx> still with the drought
[11:19:30] <decx> and now the aquafiers are filled with toxic fracking water
[11:19:42] <decx> just give up on the westcoast
[11:19:56] <robertmaxrees> nah.  i love it here still.

[11:23:40] <AR45> robertmaxrees: Oh. Hehehe, ok.
[11:30:50] <joespeakeasy> robertmaxrees… it's working in the bin correctly… hmnn.
[11:30:51] <joespeakeasy> http://jsbin.com/satijokarivu/1/
[11:31:12] <joespeakeasy> I guess I will look at my source… it's probably just a misplaced character.
[11:38:52] <joespeakeasy> problem solved.
[11:38:56] <robertmaxrees> What was it?
[11:39:10] <joespeakeasy> well...
[11:39:43] <joespeakeasy> So the first element was rendered when the page loaded. The autocomplete was bound to that with the .on()
[11:40:04] <joespeakeasy> I cloned future textarea from the first element.
[11:40:52] <joespeakeasy> so if I used the autocomplete on the first element, before I cloned it, once it was cloned, the autocomplete info (the helptext/result text) went with it.
[11:40:54] <joespeakeasy> so...
[11:41:30] <joespeakeasy> I moved the element I was using as my clone template and hid it with CSS. Then executed a clone.
[11:42:14] <joespeakeasy> so the template element is never seen, because it's hidden, so the user won't us use the autocomplete feature on the template.
[11:42:30] <robertmaxrees> ah
[11:42:33] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[11:42:46] <joespeakeasy> it's a hack, but it works for now.
[11:44:09] <joespeakeasy> hey, thanks for your interest. really. I worked on it for an hour before coming here. And I figured it out working through it in the bin.
[11:44:20] <robertmaxrees> sometimes we just need a rubber duck.
[11:44:25] <joespeakeasy> it's was a small little thing…
[11:44:26] <joespeakeasy> right.
[11:44:32] <joespeakeasy> good luck

[12:10:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I wonder in this plugin: https://github.com/hdragomir/jQuery-Fullscreen-Event/blob/master/jquery.onfullscreen-1.0.0.js - where does he define $.browser ?
[12:10:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> because I am getting that $.browser.mozilla is undefined
[12:10:49] <robertmaxrees> that's from an old version of jquery
[12:10:58] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use jquery migrate or find another plugin

I have functions that accept an arguement, that I run on document.ready but I have two instances of the function in doc.ready function('thisselector') and function('thatselector') but when I have them both, it starts acting glitchy even though "thatselector" is not in the dom on this page
[12:15:00] <ChrisBinge_> so how can I pass 2 different selectors to my function without it blowing up?
[12:22:17] <fenris_afk> hy. is ".children" somehow broken in jquery-svg?
[12:22:34] <ThKo> Hi guys, short question: Every element which I’ve added with JS e.g. this line „$("#myquestions").append( "<li><a href='questionsData.html?cid=" + results.rows.item(i).id + "' data-role='button'>" + results.rows.item(i).question + "</a></li>" );“ is not styled like an element which I’ve inserted directly into the ul-tag…Any hints for me? Thank you :)
[12:24:24] <fenris_kcf> ThKo: first i'd recommend that _if_ you generate html with jquery, you should at least use the methods to set the attributes
[12:24:43] <fenris_kcf> (.attr, .addClass, etc.)
[12:24:50] <ThKo> Ah ok, I understand.
[12:25:16] <ThKo> My way is that I make a sql query to my sqlite database and after that I add the elements to my html structure.
[12:26:17] <fenris_kcf> how is it differently styled?
[12:26:24] <fenris_kcf> does it miss a class maybe?
[12:26:37] <badams> what's the best way to build/update a block of html via jquery? should I use a template, or just general dom manipulation?
[12:27:12] <ciqsteve> Q:  I have 10 elements, each with a data value (in the div -  data-my-number).   How can I get just those 10 numbers into an array?
[12:27:22] <ciqsteve> I can think of a long way to do it, but figure there is something more elegant
[12:28:00] <fenris_kcf> use .slice and .map?
[12:28:07] <fenris_kcf> (js-functions)
[12:28:16] <Nhgu> hello
[12:28:22] <fenris_kcf> hy
[12:28:34] <fenris_kcf> badams: what you mean by "build/update"?
[12:28:43] <badams> there's a list of items.
[12:29:12] <ThKo> fenris_kcf: It seems it hasn’t got stylesheets…But I’ve fixed it…After append(…) just insert .trigger( "create" )… :-)
[12:30:03] <badams> list of items, there's a click handler which grabs this div/content in the ul of items, and then does an update of text within it
[12:30:20] <badams> if you can create a dom el, you should be able to update it, practically speakign.
[12:31:26] <fenris_kcf> well, it depends on what you want to update
[12:31:49] <badams> well there are data attributes that need updating, and then they are currently just buliding out some html with a 'string'
[12:32:00] <badams> i'd prefer to make it more declarative than some string building.
[12:32:04] <badams> was looking at jquery templates.
[12:32:06] <fenris_kcf> there's ".attr(name, new_value)" for
[12:32:38] <fenris_kcf> but the hidden data-attribute is manipulated via ".data"
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() for attributes btw.
[12:32:59] <badams> basically, they are doing a $item = $this.parents().eq(5), then status = $item.attr('data-doc_stats') and so forth for about 5 data attributes.
[12:33:06] <badams> then they are writing out a stribg
[12:33:22] <robertmaxrees> and use .data() for data attributes.
[12:33:27] <badams> yea, i thought prop was considered the better way from what I remember.
[12:33:33] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[12:33:40] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[12:33:53] <badams> yea, i see that .data() is the way to, my issue is more abotu a better way to get and update these elements
[12:34:16] <badams> right now it's sort of kludgy, and hadn't used jquery templates, and wasn't sure if that was a reccomended route or not for this sort of thing
[12:34:29] <robertmaxrees> you can build up an element and edit it that way instead.
[12:34:45] <Toerkeium> I'm developing a "console" where the user will be able to see some changes which are going to be taken from a database. Do you know what's the best way to do it in order to not build a loop in the client?
[12:34:58] <badams> socket?
[12:35:21] <badams> robertmaxrees: what's the best way to go about templating? is that built into jquery, or is that a plugin/external thing?
[12:35:50] <robertmaxrees> that's a job for another plugin.
[12:35:55] <robertmaxrees> or library.
[12:36:00] <badams> ok.
[12:36:03] <robertmaxrees> underscore has one built in.
[12:36:30] <badams> ah ok. this proj is using underscore
[12:36:36] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[12:36:37] <badams> so that sounds good
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> http://underscorejs.org/#template
[12:38:21] <badams> sounds good. I can do data attributes via the template as well?
[12:38:36] <robertmaxrees> data attributes in html are what they are, so yes.
[12:38:40] <badams> ok.
[12:38:43] <robertmaxrees> data-my-thing="value"
[12:38:47] <badams> yup yup
[12:38:47] <badams> ok
[12:38:51] <badams> let me digest that. thnaks
[12:45:39] <jdo_dk> If i use a form with: <input type="text" required> and do the submit with js: $("#myForm").submit(); is required then ignored ?
[12:46:28] <NoiseEee> jdo_dk: unless you've specifically got a handler on your submit action that looks for 'required' inputs
[12:47:23] <jdo_dk> so $("myFOrm").submit() should still handle fields with required ?
[12:47:37] <NoiseEee> 'handle'? jdo_dk?
[12:47:38] <jdo_dk> handle like "validate" them?
[12:47:54] <NoiseEee> not unless you have a validation library hooked up and ready to act
[12:48:18] <jdo_dk> Bugger
[12:52:28] <ciqsteve> Q: can I sort of list of jquery elements in place?
[12:52:40] <NoiseEee> "in place" ?
[12:52:45] <ciqsteve> I'm grabbing elements from a numbered list by matching a selector
[12:52:59] <ciqsteve> but when I .each() throught the elements they dont come in # order
[12:53:04] <ciqsteve> yet they must
[12:53:14] <ciqsteve> :)
[12:53:26] <NoiseEee> ciqsteve: jsfiddle?
[12:53:51] <ciqsteve> I guess my first q is this, does jquery return items in the order it finds them in the dom?
[12:54:09] <ciqsteve> NoiseEee - too complicated to break out
[12:54:35] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: Did you google?
[12:54:37] <NoiseEee> ciqsteve: yes, it returns items in order
[12:54:40] <NoiseEee> iirc
[12:55:32] <ciqsteve> k thanks
[12:56:18] <NoiseEee> ... but when you iterate through an object, there is no guaranteed 'order'
[12:56:28] <ciqsteve> .each() for example
[12:57:00] <NoiseEee> a jquery object (which is not a regular object) is more like an array;  i do believe order is maintained
[12:57:24] <NoiseEee> again, feel free to fiddle to test or someone can pipe up if i'm mistaken etc
[12:57:24] <ciqsteve> yeah it doesn't look like it based on what I'm seeing
[12:57:57] <ciqsteve> I'll play with it some more thanks
[12:58:03] <aftab> Hello, I have 50+ images in each div with class col-md-4 inside a div with class row, I have set width to 100% for each image but some images have less height and it messes up the display of images in each row, please let me know how to fix this?
[12:59:14] <geri> hi, how can i get the correct col of the table when i select the cell? http://jsfiddle.net/7ad2zy9k/
[13:00:37] <geri> this only gives me the row correctly!
[13:01:28] <geri> sorry i mean the row is wrong
[13:11:27] <badams> how do i check to see what function has a handler on a particular element?
[13:11:30] <badams> is there a way to do so in chrome?
[13:13:18] <NoiseEee> i think there's an 'event listeners' tab in the Elements pane, badams
[13:15:17] <NoiseEee> but i've not played with it
[13:18:22] <aftab> Hello, I have 50+ images in each div with class col-md-4 inside a div with class row, I have set width to 100% for each image but some images have less height and it messes up the display of images in each row, please let me know how to fix this?
[13:19:14] <fenris_kcf> does not sound like a jquery-issue
[13:19:22] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ aftab
[13:19:22] <b-ot> aftab: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:19:55] <BillCriswell> What would you expect the images to look like?
[13:20:00] <BillCriswell> I'm confused.
[13:22:35] <aftab> I will paste the code on jsfiddle now
[13:23:58] <robertmaxrees> aftab is this an issue with jquery specifically, or something else?
[13:25:23] <aftab> robertmaxrees: I am not sure because with css I can fix the height but it doesn't work properly when resizing the window as it keeps the fixed height and changes the width
[13:25:31] <aftab> can i show you the screen shot ?
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> aftab that sounds like a CSS issue then.
[13:25:43] <robertmaxrees> you should probably hit up #css for that.
[13:25:46] <aftab> http://jsfiddle.net/19kr14ge/
[13:25:50] <aftab> ok
[13:33:17] <mbrzuzy> aftab, I don't see what the problem is.  Did you include css?
[13:33:44] <robertmaxrees> mbrzuzy it's not on topic for this channel - that's why we directed him to #css :)
[13:33:52] <mbrzuzy> ah
[13:35:17] <geri> robertmaxrees: hi, how can i get the correct row of the table when i select the cell? http://jsfiddle.net/7ad2zy9k/ ... the col is correct!
[13:36:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:36:17] <robertmaxrees> you want the current row and column when you click?
[13:36:25] <geri> i implemented mouse over
[13:36:38] <geri> and want to print the row, col of the selected cell
[13:36:55] <geri> only the col gets correclty printed
[13:37:20] <geri> robertmaxrees: yes for click and mouseover
[13:37:49] <geri> robertmaxrees: the row of the cell is always wrong
[13:38:04] <fenris_kcf> i'd just store this kind of information in "rel" or such
[13:38:15] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy.
[13:38:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7ad2zy9k/1/
[13:38:57] <geri> robertmaxrees: whats wrong in my code?
[13:39:06] <robertmaxrees> you're making it too complicated.
[13:39:11] <robertmaxrees> not even going to try to understand yours haha
[13:40:24] <robertmaxrees> if you wnat to use cellindex, you need to call it on the underlying DOM node, not the jquery object.
[13:40:48] <geri> robertmaxrees: which language do you use for the backend?
[13:40:54] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[13:40:54] <BillCriswell> NEver heard of cellindex
[13:41:04] <robertmaxrees> geri for my own projects, or at work?
[13:41:05] <geri> robertmaxrees: golang?
[13:41:09] <geri> robertmaxrees: both
[13:41:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:41:12] <doug_> geri: don't put separate click handlers on every row. use .closest('tr') or something more specific to find the row
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> doug_ or use the delegated listener I did.
[13:41:41] <doug_> robertmaxrees: yes that too :)
[13:41:43] <robertmaxrees> geri: for my own projects, a little node.  at work, coldfusion and java.
[13:41:54] <robertmaxrees> i would never suggest coldfusiuon for anything though.
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> terrible language.
[13:41:56] <geri> robertmaxrees: did you try golang?
[13:42:02] <robertmaxrees> i've looked at it.
[13:42:16] <geri> robertmaxrees: so?
[13:42:34] <robertmaxrees> didn't really tickle my brain very much.
[13:42:44] <BillCriswell> Why would there be a cellindex but not a rowindex
[13:42:49] <geri> robertmaxrees: you like to do think more complicated? :)
[13:43:10] <robertmaxrees> geri not necessarily.  just not really all that interested in go.  rust looks neat imo.
[13:43:27] <geri> robertmaxrees: rust syntax is pretty complicated
[13:43:39] <geri> and not that readable
[13:43:40] <robertmaxrees> sure, but i like the way it works with expressions.
[13:44:01] <geri> e.g.?
[13:44:07] <robertmaxrees> i like it personally.  i also like javascript so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:44:16] <robertmaxrees> kind of offtopic for the channel.
[13:44:25] <BillCriswell> Oh, duh, cause it's on the row.
[13:44:29] <BillCriswell> What a dumb dumb.
[13:44:30] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell hahaha
[13:44:45] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell it'd made sense for it to be on the TR as well though.
[13:44:47] <robertmaxrees> *TD
[13:44:53] <doug_> you can use .index to find the row index
[13:45:07] <geri> robertmaxrees: dont worry :)
[13:45:11] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I'd agree, but el.parentElement.rowIndex isn't too bad I suppose.
[13:45:16] <doug_> $('tr').index(someTrElement)
[13:45:25] <geri> robertmaxrees: i better wait until the make it 1.0
[13:45:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah there are a few ways to do it.
[13:46:30] <BillCriswell> doug_: This is probably a lot quicker than doing that.
[13:46:39] <geri> robertmaxrees: so rust can run in the browser as well?
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> geri sorry, you're still off topic.
[13:47:16] <geri> robertmaxrees: you dont join rust do u?
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:47:32] <BillCriswell> doug_: http://jsbin.com/kiviyo/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:47:41] <geri> robertmaxrees: i cant private message you :)
[13:49:20] <doug_> BillCriswell: that steps outside jquery's ability to work around DOM weirdness/differences though. your implementation is probably very fast though
[13:49:42] <robertmaxrees> doug_ yeah, he's avoiding the whole jquery portion of stuff.
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> which can increase speed meaningfully depending on the case.
[13:50:21] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you'd have to see how safe it can be of course. I just wasn't aware of the index thing.
[13:51:31] <doug_> BillCriswell: it's probably fine, but I have a mental wall of FUD whenever dealing with the DOM :D
[13:51:43] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[13:51:44] <BillCriswell> doug_: Haha totally understood.
[13:52:13] <BillCriswell> doug_: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/html/ looks good here.
[13:53:09] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8685739/difference-between-dom-parentnode-and-parentelement interesting haha
[13:53:27] <BillCriswell> The shit you learn console.dir()ing an element.
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> iiiinteresting
[14:08:59] <robertmaxrees> https://neil.fraser.name/software/JS-Interpreter/ this is neat.
[14:10:35] <doug_> robertmaxrees: it would be cool to look at how he implemented closure scope chains
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter
[14:16:42] <doug_> robertmaxrees: no unit tests?! I would be extremely impressed if it didn't have several bugs. great project though
[14:16:54] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha unit tests
[14:17:03] <robertmaxrees> you'd hate where i work right now :)
[14:17:09] <doug_> :O
[14:17:15] <robertmaxrees> we're working on fixing that now.
[14:17:23] <robertmaxrees> but our frontend has very little testing.
[14:17:32] <robertmaxrees> except for functional stuff.
[14:17:40] <doug_> everybody's frontend lacks proper testing
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> sure - our testing suites have gotten MUCH better.  good coverage of functional stuff these days.
[14:19:02] <doug_> source control + unit tests = no fear of making changes
[14:19:13] <robertmaxrees> just about.
[14:19:27] <robertmaxrees> we also do a UAT before releasing.
[14:19:34] <robertmaxrees> which catches stuff, too.
[14:20:26] <thebope> Testing is for chumps
[14:20:34] <thebope> Just bang out some code and push it on up
[14:20:44] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:21:15] <thebope> attach everything to the DOM and it all works out anyways
[14:21:27] <thebope> tons of global variables
[14:21:28] <doug_> and tell the users that when stuff breaks, go look at the console, and if it says red stuff, just refresh the page and try to do it differently :D
[14:21:37] <thebope> "It works on my machine"
[14:23:30] <thebope> Actually... that reminds me...
[14:23:38] <thebope> I should probably be writing some tests for this controller
[14:24:09] <doug_> "did you try turning it off and on again?"
[14:24:50] <thebope> hahaha, "Probably just a cache issue"
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> it's sad how often that's the case for us.
[14:25:22] <robertmaxrees> the CDN acting up :(
[14:25:36] <doug_> I never use CDNs
[14:25:54] <doug_> why would I give the CDN free tracking data
[14:25:58] <thebope> CDNs are for chumps
[14:26:07] <thebope> just take an old laptop and hook it up to the ethernet
[14:26:10] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:26:14] <thebope> and let 'er fly
[14:27:23] <doug_> if you put the code on your own site you can configure the caching properly so it doesnt even have to look at the server. CDNs deliberately make you check every time so they can track you
[14:27:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:28:42] <doug_> if your site has any usefulness at all, the user won't mind waiting an extra 0.2 seconds on the first load
[14:29:13] * thebope refrains from talking about usefulness is for chumps
[14:29:19] <robertmaxrees> or you serve a pretty large area and there's an actual need to have boxes that are physically closer.
[14:30:20] <thebope> Yea, we're an ad agency so we've got pixels firing all over the place
[14:30:37] <doug_> robertmaxrees: that's a legitimate reason though. most people use cdn's because that's what the cool kids do
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> doug_ we use them because we serve the US and Canada and do ecommerce.  we'll take every little bit we can get.
[14:31:43] <thebope> oh yea, thats why we need them, it's the actual ad serving, not the pixels that need the boxes closer
[14:32:44] <doug_> why doesn't someone attack them? blast them with random referrers
[14:34:40] <thebope> ad serving?
[14:34:42] <thebope> or the pixels?
[14:35:37] <thebope> I think online advertising tracking is such a... grey market anyways that it might be hard to tell if someone did
[14:35:52] <thebope> although I guess we would know based on what ads we served and to who
[14:35:58] <thebope> and we could cross check it with which pixels fired
[14:36:11] <thebope> I'm not on the data end of things though so it's a bit beyond my function scope
[14:36:13] <thebope> ;-)
[14:36:26] <doug_> I logged into my gmail on my sister's machine and left it logged in for a couple of days. sure enough, I started getting women's products as ads
[14:36:34] <frank_o> What would be the best way to go about adding a `destroy` method to the [Snap.js][1] mobile panel plugin? https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/blob/v2.0.0-rc1/src/snap.js
[14:36:37] <frank_o> I have never done this before so pointers would be appreciated. Is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10826046/how-to-have-an-instance-delete-itself-from-within-a-prototype-function-is-javasc the right place to start maybe?
[14:37:16] <doug_> frank_o: js uses a garbage collector
[14:37:37] <doug_> frank_o: there is no such thing as "freeing memory". the only way to release memory is to not have any references referring to it
[14:38:22] <frank_o> doug_: I see I see, well let me take note of that
[14:38:33] <robertmaxrees> frank_o are you having memory management problems?
[14:38:41] <frank_o> I need to be able to destroy it before reinitializing it on page change in jQuery Mobile -- otherwise it will only work on the first page: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/L3dkmkrx/1/
[14:38:54] <OHNERO> Hey guys, I am having an issue with showing a div after hover on a menu item. I can show the div but once I roll over the div (sub menu) it disappears obviously. How can I make it so when I hover over the menu item or the div they both stay open until either of them are mouseleave? http://jsfiddle.net/3fcamt3n/
[14:38:58] <doug_> frank_o: however, it is possible for a plugin to "shut itself down" by removing any data it set and clearing the reference to it from $.fn
[14:40:56] <doug_> frank_o: in your first example on SO, the 'k' variable is keeping the object alive. k = undefined will "free" the object
[14:40:59] <frank_o> doug_: Cool. So in the case of https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js/blob/v2.0.0-rc1/src/snap.js it basically just means resetting all of its variables?
[14:41:17] <robertmaxrees> frank_o are you trying to just deactivate an instance of a widget or something?
[14:41:40] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: Pretty much, yep
[14:42:35] <doug_> my understanding is, he's fighting jquery ui (again) and he needs to totally reinitialize something that jqui screwed up. is that about right frank_o ?
[14:43:01] <doug_> jqm I mean
[14:43:16] <frank_o> doug_: Sounds about right :)
[14:43:34] <frank_o> doug_: jqm pages (http://api.jquerymobile.com/page/) aka. the primary unit of content
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> frank_o why are you destrying the main menu in this case?
[14:43:57] <robertmaxrees> why not update the menu?
[14:44:19] <doug_> robertmaxrees: good luck with that. have they fixed that yet?
[14:44:30] <robertmaxrees> doug_ hrm?
[14:44:35] <robertmaxrees> no clue - i don't use jqui and jqm
[14:44:39] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: i dont think that is possible.
[14:44:53] <doug_> last time I fought jqm you CAN'T update it, so I totally brute force recreated the whole menu
[14:45:03] <frank_o> jqm and this "reality of multiple pages" is quite confusing. tons of js has to be rerun every time a new page is "shown".
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> frank_o http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23875815/how-to-use-snap-js-panels-with-jquery-mobile is this helpful at all?
[14:45:41] <frank_o> i'd use jqm's own native panel widget but it won't be fully scrollable until at least version 1.7.
[14:45:51] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: unfortunately not
[14:46:10] <frank_o> that one covers only the first page iirc
[14:46:12] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ dunno then.  good luck i guess.
[14:46:30] <frank_o> thanks
[14:46:43] <doug_> I should make a parody someday. It'll be a street fighter fight: jquery mobile vs web developer
[14:46:51] <doug_> jqm kicks the dev's ass btw
[14:46:59] <robertmaxrees> lol - they're trying to make it better.
[14:47:11] <doug_> I know. they are pushing the limit
[14:47:22] <doug_> but man I learned to avoid it :(
[14:47:29] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[14:47:38] <frank_o> sadly jqm is getting a lot of heat because a lot of devs produce shitty apps with it. same with phonegap.
[14:47:44] <robertmaxrees> and jquery.
[14:47:48] <robertmaxrees> and jquery ui.
[14:47:50] <frank_o> yes
[14:47:51] <robertmaxrees> and lots of other tools.
[14:47:53] <frank_o> there we go
[14:48:22] <frank_o> and the REAL talent.. they refuse to let the world know what they used (calling it a trade secret :P)
[14:48:24] <doug_> if you go with the flow, jqm is amazing. as soon as you step outside their expectations, you're toast
[14:48:49] <cuba_libre__> Hello guys.
[14:49:05] <frank_o> doug_: pretty nice definition
[14:49:07] <cuba_libre__> Can anyone tell me what is the best way to display an image with jQuery and then replace it?
[14:49:17] <frank_o> cuba_libre__: herro
[14:49:22] <robertmaxrees> append an image tag, then update the src prop.
[14:49:24] <cuba_libre__> Basically I'd like to display an image and then have an easy way of changing it
[14:49:38] <cuba_libre__> I see
[14:49:43] <cuba_libre__> thanks
[14:50:27] <frank_o> cuba_libre__: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded is also quite nice if you need to make sure the image has loaded before you continue
[14:50:42] <cuba_libre__> frank_o thank you
[14:50:48] <cuba_libre__> I will check it out
[14:51:07] <robertmaxrees> or just bind the to the load event of the image - that should work just fine.
[14:54:12] <doug_> cuba_libre__: if you want cool looking transitions there are hundreds of plugins that will do that for you
[14:54:28] <cuba_libre__> doug_ any examples in mind?
[14:55:34] <doug_> cuba_libre__: http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=slider
[14:56:39] <cuba_libre__> These seem to be sliders as for sliding the ux.
[14:56:49] <cuba_libre__> Or did you mean a specific plugin from the list?
[14:57:04] <frank_o> cuba_libre__: It seems to be a common consensus here that https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/ is the best slideshow plugin of all times. If you want extraordinary transitions, check out http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/.
[14:57:14] <frank_o> * of all time
[14:58:18] * frank_o has spent a LOT of hours digging through GitHub repos :-)
[14:58:35] <cuba_libre__> frank_o Thanks, this will cerainly come in handy.
[14:58:42] <frank_o> its kind of like digging through old vinyl records at the local thrift shop. becomes almost like an addiction.
[14:59:02] <cuba_libre__> frank_o I know that feel. Used to dig vinyls for samples
[14:59:09] <cuba_libre__> :D
[14:59:10] <phelix> I have 2 submit buttons on a form. I want one to submit the form but the other one to not submit the form and just reload the page. I can't seem to figure out how to do this? The submit form button is working fine but how would I get just a refresh of the page on the other button?
[14:59:11] <frank_o> cool :)
[14:59:28] <doug_> phelix: put type="button" on the refresh one
[14:59:33] <doug_> and it won't try to submit
[14:59:50] <phelix> ahh ok
[15:00:02] <cuba_libre__> frank_o So what's your favorite github gem?
[15:00:10] <doug_> phelix:  the default is type="submit" if you don't say
[15:00:34] <phelix> perfect! thank you..
[15:00:42] <robertmaxrees> phelix or directly bind a listener to that button and preventDefault() against the click event.
[15:00:43] <robertmaxrees> either/or/.
[15:00:53] <phelix> ok great thank you guys
[15:03:54] <frank_o> cuba_libre__: oooh tough one :D
[15:03:55] <Respek> frank_o: effect is going to be so great when it's out
[15:04:20] <Respek> frank_o: effeckt*
[15:04:57] <frank_o> Respek: for sure
[15:05:42] <frank_o> cuba_libre__: probably packery
[15:06:02] <greenwolf> where can I find good tutials on learning jquery?
[15:06:16] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a great place to start.
[15:07:15] <cuba_libre__> frank_o cool stuff
[15:07:19] <greenwolf> OK cool thanks
[15:07:44] <doug_> greenwolf: that and hang out in this room and attempt to solve people's issues. I found that to be an incredibly effective way to learn it once I was past the basics
[15:08:02] <frank_o> cuba_libre__: if you need some drum beats to your vinyl samples be sure to check out https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-beats too
[15:08:54] <cuba_libre__> frank_o haha cool. I prefer to slice them piece by piece though
[15:09:51] <frank_o> eeexcellent :D
[15:09:58] <doug_> a wise man commented on the stackoverflow chat: telling a developer that a library already does that is like telling a songwriter that there is already a song about love
[15:10:25] <dmsuperman> eh, not really apt
[15:10:30] <robertmaxrees> agreed.
[15:11:07] <robertmaxrees> libraries are like guitar pedals.  two pedals might be for "distortion", but the sound the generate can be wildly different.
[15:11:10] <dmsuperman> the intention behing programming is to do less work. the intention behind songwriting is to express what you're going through, even if it's not unique. not to be efficient
[15:11:14] <dmsuperman> lol
[15:14:16] <islalobo> we're using jquery cycle for a slidshow w/ drupal's views and we  are looking for a solution to allow the next/previous buttons to control the direction the image transition's in from.
[15:14:18] <doug_> Generic CACHE Level-2 Generic Error D:    <-- uh, intel, what the....
[15:15:04] <doug_> oops, wrong room, sorry
[15:20:23] <doug_> screw it, I can't be bothered to register again. I'll ignore channels that require identify
[15:20:45] <robertmaxrees> hahaha whyfor?
[15:20:51] <doug_> http://pastebin.com/xQ4t3pMb
[15:21:04] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:21:13] <doug_> ##hardware requires identify :(
[15:22:42] <robertmaxrees> it's easy to setup automatically.
[15:24:07] <doug_> I know, some trick with the password. i can't be bothered. when you identify then anytime you suspend/resume a laptop, you get un-identified because it thinks I am already logged in
[15:26:21] <robertmaxrees> then you ghost and reclaim your nick
[15:26:34] <robertmaxrees> which you could script out pretty easy.
[15:27:12] <enigmabomb> I’m having a hard time figuring out how to why jquery won’t execute my code on line 146. It appears to be loaded, but then it fails on any jquery code in the page. I’m out of ideas. http://programs.lucidworks.com/Cloudera-vs-Lucidwords.html
[15:27:20] <enigmabomb> (And it works locally)
[15:28:14] <doug_> enigmabomb: look at the debugger console
[15:28:18] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[15:28:19] <enigmabomb> Yep Im in it
[15:28:21] <robertmaxrees> jquery 1.2.6 ?
[15:28:29] <robertmaxrees> that'll be your first problem.
[15:28:43] <enigmabomb> Their jquery-latest is loading 1.2.6?
[15:28:50] <enigmabomb> If thats true im going to go ballistic
[15:28:58] <enigmabomb> omfg
[15:29:00] <doug_> lol
[15:29:07] <robertmaxrees>  * $Date: 2008-05-24 14:22:17 -0400 (Sat, 24 May 2008) $
[15:29:08] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[15:29:13] <enigmabomb> Sorry gents
[15:29:13] <robertmaxrees> found your first problem.
[15:29:17] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[15:29:23] <enigmabomb> Let me try actual jquery latest
[15:29:27] <doug_> they must have thought the late in latest means deadest
[15:29:33] <enigmabomb> And I suppose this i s a good lesson.
[15:29:43] <enigmabomb> It also speaks to what a rancid piece of crap marketo is
[15:30:04] <vapeboy> heya! I'm having problems with a slider: http://pastebin.com/kRS989V4
[15:30:07] <vapeboy> www.vapeboy.com
[15:30:19] <vapeboy> it works fine until I move away from the page and come back later
[15:30:32] <robertmaxrees> vapeboy http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[15:30:32] <vapeboy> and it's stuck on a slide with no text, and it' doesn't change anymore
[15:30:35] <enigmabomb> nice paralax vapeboy
[15:30:41] <vapeboy> can you please help me out?
[15:30:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll likely get more help if you reduce your example down into a fiddle.
[15:31:13] <vapeboy> I'm a total newb, how do I do that?
[15:31:36] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[15:33:23] <vapeboy> can you guys please make an exception? is there something obviously wrong with the script I've pasted?
[15:33:43] <vapeboy> I'm quite desperate - can't track down the problem, wasted my whole day on this
[15:34:13] <il> can't jquery do everything angularjs can do?
[15:34:21] <robertmaxrees> il kind of?
[15:34:26] <robertmaxrees> different separations of concern.
[15:34:39] <doug_> il: not really
[15:34:41] <robertmaxrees> people use them together in a lot of cases.
[15:35:03] <robertmaxrees> one is dom abtraction, the other is an MVC
[15:35:07] <doug_> il: jquery abstracts the DOM and has some ajax and animation and promise stuff. angular is completely different
[15:35:21] <enigmabomb> ok, now Im running a modern bootstrap (Yay) but it still won’t execute my code on line 147 http://programs.lucidworks.com/Cloudera-vs-Lucidwords.html
[15:35:45] <enigmabomb> The console makes me think its not loading jquery but it clearly is
[15:35:52] <vapeboy> robertmaxrees: can you please
[15:36:04] <vapeboy> "parse" my pastebin and tell me if there's an evident error?
[15:36:09] <doug_> vapeboy: paste the html in here in the top left. css in top right http://jsfiddle.net/fkc2boar/
[15:36:24] <robertmaxrees> enigmabomb try using a jquery closure instead.
[15:36:35] <doug_> vapeboy: in the future, you should make a fiddle so you won't need a nice guy like me to convert it to a fiddle :D
[15:36:54] <robertmaxrees> wrap your code in (function($) { })(jQuery);
[15:36:57] <enigmabomb> robertmaxrees isn’t that just an anonymous method?
[15:37:01] <enigmabomb> Ah ok
[15:37:02] <doug_> vapeboy: save it and paste the link here
[15:37:07] <Getty> Tried to work with this: https://github.com/birchroad/node-jspack horrible horrible disaster..... <hmpf>
[15:37:07] <robertmaxrees> enigmabomb you're in noconflict.
[15:37:53] <enigmabomb> Ah, the docs say no conflict will basically pretend jquery doesnt exist, and thats totally the problem im having!
[15:38:02] <enigmabomb> Can I remove that no conflict line?
[15:38:03] <doug_> enigmabomb: the docs dont say that
[15:38:09] <robertmaxrees> exactly.  they "turned off $"
[15:38:09] <vapeboy> doug_: thanks so much. the html and the css are huge and dispersed. it's quite a mess :\
[15:38:29] <vapeboy> can't you say if it's messed up by just looking at the <script>?
[15:38:31] <robertmaxrees> vapeboy we need a small test case or you should go look for a channel for a developer to help you.
[15:38:43] <enigmabomb> Ok, got it =)
[15:38:58] <vapeboy> doug_: it's wordpress and I'm a total newb
[15:39:06] <doug_> vapeboy: http://sscce.org/
[15:39:18] <doug_> you will get far more help if you help those you ask for help :D
[15:40:55] <vapeboy> doug_: I'm guess I'm wasting your time then :( sorry, and thanks anyway
[15:42:46] <enigmabomb> vapeboy: Just because of the sheer volume of questions channels like htis get, the format has been standardized to make it easier for people helping
[15:43:05] <enigmabomb> The price is right, so it’s worth it to follow the format.
[15:43:25] <robertmaxrees> that and it's hard for us to dump through all of your code and get acquainted with the style, layout, etc.
[15:43:57] <robertmaxrees> there could be tons of other factors at play.  small test cases sometimes even help people help themselves - they fix the error in the process.
[15:44:14] <vapeboy> will try standardizing it tomorrow
[15:44:28] <vapeboy> thanks for explaining that to me
[15:44:38] <enigmabomb> Also, vapeboy, this sounds like a very edge case. Why do you care?
[15:44:38] <vapeboy> can you at least replicate the issue on my live website?
[15:45:37] <enigmabomb> vapeboy: I’d say fix this problem by ditching the carousel. Problem solved. http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[15:46:14] <robertmaxrees> vapeboy is the issue that it goes to the second slide and does nothing after?
[15:46:21] <robertmaxrees> because i can confirm thats what i saw.
[15:46:27] <vapeboy> robertmaxrees: yep
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> did you hire a developer for this?
[15:47:46] <vapeboy> enigmabomb: haha, nice one
[15:48:05] <enigmabomb> vapeboy: Im dead serious. You want conversions, ditch that thing.
[15:48:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.
[15:48:31] <robertmaxrees> you're giving up a crucial spot on your site.
[15:50:33] <vapeboy> thing is, it's a template and I wouldn't know what to do with that space anyway
[15:50:38] <vapeboy> at this point, at least
[15:50:43] <vapeboy> so you guys are saying
[15:50:51] <vapeboy> that I'm better off if I make it fixed?
[15:51:04] <robertmaxrees> the industry says you'll probably get higher conversions.
[15:51:38] <vapeboy> wow, thanks
[15:51:45] <vapeboy> \o/
[15:52:35] <enigmabomb> Make it fixed, make it tout your value prop / product / or a sale
[15:52:40] <enigmabomb> Or most popular item
[15:52:45] <enigmabomb> And just move on with your life.
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:53:43] <enigmabomb> Anyhow, I have to go back to marketing for the folks Im helping today. Good luck vapeboy. Thanks for the help everyone. Sometimes its the littlelest things….. =)
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:32:05] <AcousticDan> quick question: I have this date 10/01/2014
[16:32:17] <AcousticDan> I need it formatted like October 1, 2014
[16:32:22] <AcousticDan> can this be done with jquery?
[16:33:54] <shoky> no
[16:35:04] <__joshua__> AcousticDan: use moment.js
[16:35:25] <AcousticDan> oh nice
[16:35:32] <AcousticDan> thanks __joshua__
[16:45:22] <solexious> Hello, I'm trying to search the DOM for a tbody tage with the id #cueRows and append to it, using this doesn't find it, bit if I remove tbody or #cueRows it does, just not together, any ideas?
[16:45:22] <solexious> $('#cueRows').append("foo");
[16:45:37] <solexious> s/tage/tag/
[16:46:29] <solexious> $('tbody #cueRows').append("foo");
[16:46:29] <solexious> ^ the actual line of code :/
[16:46:45] <robertmaxrees> $('#cueRows') is all you need.
[16:46:59] <AcousticDan> exit
[16:47:02] <robertmaxrees> all ids should be unique
[16:47:14] <solexious> robertmaxrees: Cool, dodn't know if I should check its a tbody too
[16:47:23] <solexious> thanks  :)
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> solexious just don't repeat IDs and you should be fine.
[16:47:51] * solexious tips hat
[17:06:24] <ZacHarney> Hi, is there a javascript/jquery library to create a gallery like on my flickr photostream at https://www.flickr.com/photos/zacharneyphoto/
[17:06:45] <ZacHarney> actually don't follow that link, they're all hidden
[17:07:06] <ZacHarney> like here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk
[17:13:16] <doug_> ZacHarney: :O   have you looked at how many pages there are? 980!
[17:16:03] <ZacHarney> wow!! no, i just picked his stream at random. I'm currently using packery.js but I really like the way flickr photostream rows are all even and how the photos, depending on size and ratio, display differently, so say panoramas are big and take up half or all of a row while a portrait is small.
[17:17:15] <frank_o> ZacHarney: this is not possible with packery afaik
[17:18:04] <ZacHarney> no, I know that, that's why i'm looking for a different library that does do that, unless it's a flickr only thing that no one's replicated yet
[17:18:10] <frank_o> ZacHarney: https://github.com/ionelmc/jquery-gp-gallery
[17:18:11] <tinkiete> hi to all
[17:18:58] <tinkiete> i got a problem when i click on a button, i want to change the id, of the button, so when i reclick on the same button, i can use that changed button to call a click event
[17:19:26] <tinkiete> this is my code http://jsfiddle.net/97b4u9fh/
[17:19:30] <tinkiete> it doesnt work
[17:21:47] <ZacHarney> frank i'm trying it out now
[17:29:55] <ZacHarney> frank_o it doesn't work properly with my image: http://tinypic.com/r/bgzszn/8 leaves too much white space. Do you know of any others that might work?
[17:57:56] <mdev> jquery is so awesome
[17:58:03] <mdev> is js done right
[18:02:59] <ZacHarney> does anyone know a good jquery/javascript library for Google+ style image grid like this: https://plus.google.com/photos/+ThomasHawk/albums/posts
[18:03:30] <ZacHarney> other than gp-gallery... it doesn't work properly for me
[18:08:56] <frank_o> ZacHarney: see http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[18:18:01] <ZacHarney> frank_o thanks, I'm pretty sure I know why it's not working though, some of the images are too long to continue on that row so they're moving into the next row, but I'm looking into some other code which should hopefully work because it calculates the necessary widths to make thing fit properly and trims images down. Seems to work here: http://fmaul.de/gallery-grid-example/
[18:35:31] <frank_o> ZacHarney: ooh i like that
[18:39:26] <frank_o> ZacHarney: should ask the author if he could turn it into an easy-to-use jquery plugin over at github
[18:40:07] <frank_o> imagine if he were able to combine it with packery oh lord
[18:41:31] <ZacHarney> I can't seem to get it to work, it errors out saying "TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluation 'items.shift()')"  items.shift() is in the buildImageRow function expression. I've copied and pasted the code directly from the source code, which works perfectly on his page, but errors on mine.
[18:42:31] <frank_o> time for that test case then my brother :)
[18:46:19] <ZacHarney> have a look here: http://pastebin.com/Tapi3WBP I've pasted the code specific to the error, outside of this code, nothing could be causing it, I just can't figure out why the function isn't getting the vars properly
[18:47:03] <frank_o> ZacHarney: no, you really need to read http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[18:48:57] <ZacHarney> I did, and by that pages definition, that pastebin is a reduced test case. That code there is the only thing relevant. Nothing else interacts with the plugin and nothing else could possibly be causing the error.
[18:50:51] <frank_o> ZacHarney: well its not a live test case with html and css that you can actually run, vs http://jsfiddle.net/ or http://codepen.io/ or even http://runnable.com/
[18:51:14] <frank_o> anyway i sent a mail to the author asking him to turn it into a jquery / packery-based plugin, if you stick around i'll let you know how it goes
[18:51:16] <rss81> is there
[18:52:03] <rss81> is there a way to paste code into chat?
[18:52:26] <EspadaV8> hi, does anyone know how to attach an event listener to a video pause event using 'on' in such a way that it will work when new videos are added to the page?
[18:52:47] <EspadaV8> $(document).on('pause'...) never fires
[18:52:52] <hlve|NE> Does anybody reccomend a jQuery plugin that would help accomplish a homepage image effect like this? (http://i.imgur.com/esFrrC7.png) The images would change with others, alternating position etc.
[18:53:02] <rss81> quit
[18:53:07] <EspadaV8> and doing something like $('video').on('pause'...) doesn't work for newly added elements
[18:53:10] <rss81> Quit
[18:53:47] <hlve|NE> o_O?
[18:53:56] <Markov_> Hey, looking for some help in removing focus from a button after the click event. The event is tied to the button, so after it executes the focus remains on the button and the css for :focus is applied. I've tested the issue by placing another input on the page and changing focus to that input after the click event, but I have no need for the input. I need to remove it and need another alternative to not focus on the button after the click
[18:53:56] <Markov_> event fires.
[18:54:26] <hlve|NE> markour, did you try blur() at all?
[18:54:35] <Markov_> no
[18:54:40] <hlve|NE> ?help
[18:54:40] <b-ot> hlve|NE: NO U! ( http://aether.gf3.ca/factoids )
[18:55:14] <hlve|NE> @ Markov_ http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[18:55:25] <Markov_> do I just add blur() to the target?
[18:55:36] <hlve|NE> trigger a blur on the target.
[18:55:50] <Markov_> awesome! Let me try that!!
[18:59:15] <EspadaV8> hmmm, pause doesn't bubble, so I need to remove/add the event every time new videos are added
[19:13:06] <ZacHarney> frank_o: thanks for emailing him, in the meantime can you have a look here please? http://jsfiddle.net/zacharney/wd9q9rfL/  still gives the same error in the console.
[19:22:54] <doug_> ZacHarney: hi
[19:23:46] <tw2113> yo
[19:26:50] <doug_> ZacHarney: var item shadows the incoming item
[19:27:20] <doug_> the item.length is not the same object as the next line - the var there hides the outer one
[19:28:00] <doug_> wait, nevermind, items vs item
[19:29:27] <ZacHarney> doug: In the original code, he's getting the items to pass into the function from a json file which return objects not elements. That seems to be where the error is. Just don't know how to make it work with elements directly and not json data.
[19:29:52] <ZacHarney> he has: $.getJSON('images.json', function(data) {
[19:29:53] <ZacHarney> 		var items = data.thumbs;
[19:30:03] <doug_> shift is an array function
[19:30:07] <ZacHarney> whereas i have var items = $('.gallery-items')
[19:30:09] <doug_> that is a jquery object right?
[19:30:42] <doug_> Array.prototype.shift.call(items) might work
[19:31:05] <ZacHarney> hold on i'll try that
[19:32:43] <doug_> a jquery object doesn't necessarily have to have elements in it though
[19:32:55] <doug_> although that scenario isn't common
[19:33:47] <ZacHarney> I told the script to console.log the var before it shifts and it returned [undefined x 37] instead of content...
[19:34:21] <doug_> I don't see that
[19:34:34] <doug_> I have a bunch of div.gallery-item elements
[19:34:52] <ZacHarney> it got the items from var items = realItems.slice()
[19:35:05] <ZacHarney> if i log out realItems it gives me what I want...
[19:35:29] <ZacHarney> as does logging realItems.slice()
[19:35:38] <ZacHarney> but the var isn't saving that properly
[19:36:28] <doug_> do you have an updated fiddle to look at
[19:37:19] <ZacHarney> no, I've been working in console on my local site
[19:37:38] <ZacHarney> hold on, i'll update with the console.logs
[19:39:32] <doug_> I got the one I looked at from irc logs so I'm not sure how old it is
[19:40:47] <ZacHarney> it's the current one
[19:50:53] <ZacHarney> I can't get it to work. It looks like the code is designed to work only with creating the img elements from an external json file. It doesn't seem to want to work with existing elements. I may just have to wait and hope the guy who wrote the code originally will make a js library/plugin from it, or just find another one that does the same thing.  If someone else can get it to work, please let me know, but otherwise, I don't know
[19:50:54] <ZacHarney> nearly enough javascript to refactor the whole thing to work for me.
[20:41:11] <R13ose> How do I do smooth scrolling in parallax when I click the menu items?  Right now only the first menu item I click is smooth scrolling and none of the others.  Code: http://pastebin.com/vgbV08vK
[20:49:16] <doug64k> R13ose: that needs to be html,body to work cross-browser
[20:49:57] <doug64k> R13ose: you realize that the first if is true if # is the first character in the href
[20:50:04] <doug64k> is that really what you want?
[20:50:15] <doug64k> not found check would be < 0
[20:50:23] <doug64k> it returns -1 if not found
[20:50:50] <doug64k> then you strip the # ?
[20:51:00] <doug64k> ah
[20:51:24] <R13ose> doug64k: my links are href="#about" etc
[20:54:26] <R13ose> doug64k: what should I update?
[20:57:25] <doug64k> R13ose: http://pastebin.com/4KGkY0pY should be better
[20:57:34] <doug64k> use jsfiddle so it's easy to run and test
[20:58:26] <doug64k> oops, should be scrollTop: pos
[20:58:30] <doug64k> line 9
[21:04:20] <R13ose> doug64k: that works, thanks.
[21:04:49] <ZacHarney> frank_o doug_ and anyone else interested, I finally got the G+ style grid working with this plugin: http://collageplus.edlea.com | jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/edlea/uZv3n/
[21:06:23] <doug64k> ZacHarney: nice
[21:32:35] <Zak> ™
[21:32:49] <Zak> ugh, sorry
[21:34:08] <Uhkis> ZacHarney: you can add external libs from the toolbar on the left so you dont have to copypaste like that
[21:37:09] <ner0x> If I'm looking for a count of the number of th's in the first tr of a table, what would the selector look like?
[21:42:37] <Uhkis> $('tr:first-child').children('th').length works
[21:43:19] <Uhkis> $('tr:first-child > th').length might be faster
[21:43:26] <Guest50000> i'm trying to make any form in a document show output on a single div. So far i have this: http://pastebin.com/5pA8eEKz but it doesn't seem to add a submit event handler to any form
[21:50:18] <doug64k> Guest50000: ajax probably fails
[21:50:26] <doug64k> did you check the network tab in the debugger>
[21:50:40] <doug64k> or it runs too early
[21:52:54] <doug64k> http://pastebin.com/YJbjUPJ0
[21:54:13] <doug64k> Guest50000: ^
[21:55:28] <dleynes661> I have a site that has multiple domain addresses but point to the same site.
[21:55:36] <dleynes661> Do I need to add some kind of code that will let search engines know that I have a primary domain?
[21:56:21] <doug64k> dleynes661: why would you "need" to?
[21:56:38] <dleynes661> Just curious in terms of SEO.
[21:56:42] <dleynes661> How google looks at it.
[21:56:49] <dleynes661> ...or analytics
[21:56:57] <doug64k> shared hosting is used everywhere, but I don't know much SEO
[21:57:53] <doug64k> dleynes661:  ##seo
[21:58:35] <dleynes661> thanks doug. got some help. canonical url
[21:58:58] <ZacHarney> Uhkis: yea I know, but I didn't make the collagePlus fiddle, it's from the developer of the plugin.
[22:00:39] <Uhkis> ZacHarney: oh
[22:04:21] <jamesbdev> Hi, is there a jQuery plugin that can make css animations start when the element scrolls into view? I want to create a "pop in" animation
[22:12:42] <doug64k> jamesbdev: there are several
[22:13:10] <jamesbdev> doug64k: Thanks for replying - a while ago I found a perfect one but I can't seem to find any that fit my use case again, just random stackoverflow posts
[22:13:26] <jamesbdev> doug64k: Could you please list some for me ?
[22:13:32] <doug64k> you can do it manually very easily
[22:15:24] <jamesbdev> doug64k: I know but at least the plugin I found before, it only fired once per element when it first entered the viewport which I don't really want to write the code to do that
[22:16:43] <jamesbdev> doug64k: the iphone 6 website http://www.apple.com/au/iphone-6/ has an exmaple of the functionality i'd like to accomplish - each element is only animated once when it initially enteres the viewport
[22:17:08] <jamesbdev> ** sorry the elements on that page specifically are the size measurements
[22:18:51] <doug64k> jamesbdev: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[22:19:52] <jamesbdev> doug64k: Thanks for that. I also found http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/ which accomplishes the same thing. Thanks for your help
[22:20:22] <doug64k> jamesbdev: there's a triggerOnce option
[22:20:23] <doug64k> k

[23:40:36] <fonko> how are you guys doing
[23:41:13] <fonko> hey if there is somebody there willing to take a look some strange behavior for a simple popup, here is my example http://jsfiddle.net/mxuo6L28/
[23:41:55] <fonko> im really not being able to figure out why this popup fires after the first click
[23:42:04] <fonko> you need to clic that div twice and it starts working
[23:42:35] <fonko> that was not what i intended to do ... i need it to be trigger the first time i click that div
[23:42:58] <fonko> im an ass haha
[23:43:05] <fonko> sorry... i have to click handlers
[23:43:08] <fonko> nevermind!
[23:43:13] <fonko> disregard my previous stupidity
[23:45:51] <Kartagis> fonko: I'm failing to see. wanna enlighten me? I'm clicking on the div with the id selected and I have to click twice
