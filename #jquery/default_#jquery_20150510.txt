[02:27:29] <serge> what testing framework should I use?
[03:31:40] <lilalinuxKL> How do you stringify a json object in jquery?
[03:31:50] <lilalinuxKL> Do I need a separate library?
[03:31:56] <arthurvr> lilalinux: Just use JSON.stringify()
[03:32:34] <lilalinuxKL> thank you

[03:52:06] <rSS_> hello pauled
[04:00:42] <pauled> hi rSS_
[04:01:25] <pauled> How I can a value of this: translations = {"trans1":"Accept","trans2":"Decline"};
[04:01:34] <pauled> I can read*
[04:03:34] <arthurvr> pauled: What would you like to read of that object? For example translations.trans1 would equal ”Accept”
[04:05:25] <pauled> arthurvr: thanks :)
[04:08:10] <Kartagis> anyway, I was told the other day that I couldn't use .attr() on some elements. what are they? I've just tried with input and div, and they both work
[04:26:27] <OliPicard> Hi Everyone, I hope you all having a good sunday
[04:27:04] <OliPicard> I've got a question about Jquery and Flask, I'm trying to figure out a way of sending json data to Jquery from a Flask app.
[04:27:56] <pauled> arthurvr: in that site: http://en.lichess.org/I9wIUDHo/black I am trying to retried some value (PlayingRightNow) but I don't find it. https://github.com/ornicar/lila/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=playingRightNow
[04:28:11] <pauled> retried/retrieve*
[04:28:34] <arthurvr> pauled: please build a reduced testcase, I can’t debug a whole code base for you :D
[04:29:14] <pauled> arthurvr: I can't, I am building an GM userscript
[04:29:37] <pauled> arthurvr: I don't control the server side.
[04:30:31] <pauled> do you think the translation written in JS are loaded in serverside?
[04:31:22] <Kartagis> anyway, I was told the other day that I couldn't use .attr() on some elements. what are they? I've just tried with input and div, and they both work
[04:31:25] <pauled> scala use JS in serverside?
[04:31:55] <OliPicard> im just trying to figure out a way of connecting Flask with JQ
[04:44:38] <shoky> Kartagis: you can use it on any elements. maybe they meant that for some things it's better to use .prop() than .attr()  e.g. for an input's value, or a checkbox's checked property
[04:45:43] <Kartagis> shoky: I remember now; they said it for a
[04:46:02] <shoky> Kartagis: you can use .attr() on <a> fine
[04:51:51] <pauled> Kartagis: example here attr() doesn't work http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[04:52:22] <pauled> Kartagis: at least in my browser chrome 42
[04:55:26] <pauled> it say: $( elem ).attr( "checked" ) (1.6)	"checked" (String) Initial state of the checkbox; does not change
[04:55:27] <pauled> $( elem ).attr( "checked" ) (1.6.1+)	"checked" (String) Will change with checkbox state
[05:07:12] <uskerine> I load HTML entities with .load(), I would like to apply some AJAX methods to those items once loaded, how can that be done?
[05:26:17] <FernandoBasso> uskerine: I could not understand your question.
[05:27:43] <uskerine> thansk FernandoBasso,  I was looking for this: $('#mainContent').load('html/addUser.html', function() { $.getScript( "js/addUser.js"); } );
[05:28:27] <FernandoBasso> Ah, okay, then then addUser.js has code that deals with the just loaded html.
[05:29:09] <uskerine> right
[05:29:09] <FernandoBasso> You said HTML entities. I thought of things like &lt; or &copy;
[05:29:22] <uskerine> well, you are adding HTML stuff with .load('html/addUser.html');
[05:29:25] <uskerine> basically populating a main pane
[05:29:34] <uskerine> maybe entity was misused
[05:30:03] <FernandoBasso> Perhaps, but I'm glad found a solution.
[06:14:23] <duderion> hi guys, does anyone of you have some experience with jstree (jstree.com)
[06:14:24] <duderion> ?
[06:14:57] <duderion> btw, i dunno if this is the right place to ask ;]
[06:47:07] <shoky> duderion i've used it in the past
[06:47:16] <duderion> ah ok ;]
[06:48:44] <duderion> i tried to create different node types from context menu, and now it works
[06:49:03] <duderion> all i habe to find out now is how to show different icons in the tree for those types
[06:49:08] <duderion> habe=have
[06:49:31] <shoky> i remember the jstree docs sucked when i used it, had to figure a LOT of things out by myself
[06:49:49] <shoky> but at least they were there to figure out ;p
[06:50:43] <duderion> yep, the doc sucks
[06:51:27] <duderion> it's soooo hard to find out the things you can do with it
[06:51:53] <duderion> but in the end, i didnt find a better tree-solution, even if jstree seems to be a bit yesterday ;]
[07:04:04] <uskerine> I load a main pane with   $('#mainContent').load('html/addUser.html', function() { $.getScript( "js/addUser.js"); } );
[07:04:17] <uskerine> every time the user clicks on a menu item (different menu items load different stuff)
[07:04:39] <uskerine> is it a safe behaviour or might it lead to sort kind of memory leak?
[07:07:12] <Kartagis> why am I gettingundefined is not a function here? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/f5cgzgcs/
[07:07:45] <Kartagis> shoky: this is what I was telling you about?
[07:07:56] <Kartagis> s/\?//
[07:09:33] <shoky> Kartagis: .attr is a jquery method, you're not using jquery there
[07:09:52] <Kartagis> yeah?
[07:09:54] <shoky> `g mdn setattribute @ Kartagis

[07:18:50] <Kartagis> I'm still amazed at how I can make such silly mistakes
[07:19:04] <Kartagis> thanks shoky
[08:23:33] <Renari> Does the scroll event not work on document?
[08:23:46] <Renari> https://jsfiddle.net/ycvnug0h/
[08:23:52] <Renari> this never outputs anything to the console
[08:29:44] <Uhkis> Renari: your document doesnt have anything to scroll
[08:30:10] <Uhkis> Renari: https://jsfiddle.net/ycvnug0h/1/
[08:30:10] <Renari> Ah, I was trying to capture a scroll event on a page that has nothing to scroll.
[08:30:14] <Renari> Is that possible?
[08:30:48] <Uhkis> very possible
[08:31:04] <Renari> I found this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mousewheel
[08:31:11] <Renari> so I assume it's not natively supported
[08:34:02] <Uhkis> Renari: https://jsfiddle.net/ycvnug0h/2/ for mouse wheel
[08:35:11] <Renari> Thanks, I thought it would be more similar to capturing key events with keydown.
[09:27:13] <gtwy> can someone take a look at this screenshot http://i.imgur.com/Oy7ao6S.png
[09:27:25] <gtwy> i addClass hidden
[09:27:27] <gtwy> and then take it away
[09:27:29] <gtwy> from that div that appears
[09:27:32] <gtwy> and when i take it away
[09:27:51] <gtwy> it leaves a gap
[09:27:54] <gtwy> any help would be appreciated
[09:50:48] <iam> hello
[09:50:53] <gtwy> hello
[09:51:04] <iam> http://qp.mniip.com/p/wtx why is this code making the whole element become hidden?
[09:51:14] <iam> i only want each individual folder to be hidden
[09:51:32] * iam puts code in jsfiddle
[09:52:06] <iam> http://jsfiddle.net/23Lr4yLg/
[09:54:22] <jb0t> iam: delegate to the child element you want to target
[09:55:22] * iam googles
[09:55:23] <jb0t> iam: also, you should only use an id once
[09:55:29] <jb0t> sec. fixing
[09:55:32] <iam> okay
[09:57:31] <arkin> How do I control the order my events are bound, I am trying to stop an ajax form submission if a file is uploading using  event.stopPropagation() but it still runs
[09:57:59] <arkin> nvm
[10:03:18] <jb0t> iam: probably not exactly what you want, but closer.  http://jsfiddle.net/9abnma07/9/   you had malformed html tags as well
[10:04:47] <iam> jb0t: okay, i'll look at that
[10:25:41] <iam> jb0t: http://jsfiddle.net/hvhj5hmt/
[10:25:49] <iam> i made some modifications but it still doesn't work
[10:26:14] <iam> you can see it calling both children...
[10:26:20] <iam> at least that's what i think it's doing
[10:26:28] <iam> if i could make it only call one this would work
[10:34:32] <jb0t> one moment. your html is all wrong
[10:35:38] <iam> <_<
[10:46:28] <jb0t> iam: http://jsfiddle.net/h0byeba0/

[10:47:33] <iam> magiccccc
[10:49:17] <iam> thank you
[10:49:25] <iam> this is extremely helpful
[10:49:41] <jb0t> yw.  if you want it to look like your original.. http://jsfiddle.net/h0byeba0/1/
[10:49:51] <jb0t> drops the style on the first list item
[10:51:23] <jb0t> this is actually better http://jsfiddle.net/h0byeba0/2/
[10:51:37] <jb0t> sub list is aligned as you had it originally
[10:51:49] <iam> yeah
[10:51:57] <iam> i already removed that ul
[10:52:00] <iam> works great though
[10:52:12] <iam> now i can finally finish the file managing part
[10:52:21] <jb0t> gl
[11:01:15] <uskerine> I am not sure if I will get any answer but let's try. Could someone give some examples on average web api/web services serving times? -doing a small/medium query and returning the JSON-
[11:05:10] <uskerine> jb0t, pretty simply
[11:05:14] <uskerine> simple*
[11:05:51] <jb0t> not sure what you are asking
[11:06:12] <jb0t> serving time has nothing to do with jquery
[11:06:35] <jb0t> a function of hardware and web server
[11:06:42] <jb0t> and network
[11:08:05] <jb0t> if you want to get a general idea you can use ff/chrome dev tools and look at the performance graphing tools
[11:11:10] <jb0t> uskerine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4zSG53Qlbk
[11:14:05] <jb0t> with the tool, you can go look at some sites that you know make ajax/json request (practically all of them these days).  i'm not sure how useful the info is though because as I said, it's a function of many variables
[11:15:16] <jb0t> if you are asking, 'should i use ajax/json for my api calls vs traditional full page request/response because it's faster?'  the answer is unequivocally YES
[11:16:20] <jb0t> websockets are even faster still
[11:17:21] <jb0t> though not by orders of magnitude
[11:32:34] <uskerine> jb0t, I have "measured" with curl in loclalhost that my webservice can take 50milliseconds to server a JSON of 30 registers of 5 fields
[11:32:55] <uskerine> just wondering on usual figures, and now there will be someone who would say that "it depends"
[11:33:10] <uskerine> and sure it depends, but there would be some reasonable ranges to have a rough estimation
[12:02:41] <jb0t> the app i'm working on right now is gunicorn + django + nginx (reverse proxy) + postgresql running in local virtual machine under virtual box on a quad core machine.  serving an 8k json generated from the databasee has an 80ms response time. serving the same size json data from a static file is 40ms pre cache.  7ms post cache.
[12:11:32] <jb0t> introduce load on any of these things, and response times will rise. scale any of them up, response times go down. hard to nail down an average in general terms.  easier to determine an average on specific hardware + services + network X shaped or throttled traffic.  that's all i'm saying.
[12:13:37] <uskerine> thanks jb0t, that gives me a rough idea that my 50ms might be not so bad
[12:13:55] <uskerine> at least it seems I am on the same order of magnitude
[12:14:09] <jb0t> indeed
[12:15:34] <uskerine> I am doing a quick prototype just sqlite+python+cgi+apache in a cheap virtual host machine, which as far as I know it should be the most inefficient setup in the world, so if at least I move later to some WSGI I guess things should improve
[12:16:00] <jb0t> if you want to flex your setup , curl isn't a very good tool.  you should use something like ab (apache bench) or similar so you can get concurrency going.  will paint a much better picture of what your environment can do
[12:16:18] <uskerine> thanks for the advice
[12:16:23] <uskerine> I'll have to look
[12:17:06] <jb0t> yeah.  cheap vhosts are cheap, but .. as you'd expect. you are frequently subject to spikes in load that have nothing to do with your app.  adjacent hosted customers can affect your performance.
[12:17:39] <jb0t> so, running a load test will likely produced very different results at different times.  during peak hours..etc
[12:17:46] <uskerine> good to know that too
[12:18:00] <jb0t> gl!
[12:18:36] <uskerine> I have been so -i would say even hated- for prototyping with CGIs that I was concerned about having larger times
[12:18:42] <uskerine> same for sqlite
[12:18:47] <uskerine> but maybe it is not so bad these days
[12:19:21] <jb0t> nah.  all bets are off when prototyping.  prototype with a clear conscious
[12:20:35] <jb0t> assuming you think like I do in that prototyping is all about function.  load testing is about performance.  the two are distinct. but that's one mans opinion
[12:20:48] <uskerine> I fully agree
[12:21:08] <uskerine> I was just curious to test the CGI and see if it was so unefficient as people tend to say
[12:21:24] <uskerine> because it has been the same argument for years (heavy process)
[12:21:39] <uskerine> but processors are by far much faster in 2015 than in 1998
[12:22:17] <jb0t> well, I don't use CGI.  but, anything will work.  until it doesn't.  be pragmatic.
[12:22:43] <uskerine> I am also curious about sqlite in real world applications, I know you can't do large things with that, but I found it so easy to use that I am wondering if low load web applications would work fine
[12:23:20] <uskerine> it is much easier to deploy than any other sql db, and at the end of the day, I do not use all that fancy stuff of larger databases
[12:24:08] <jb0t> very low traffic, it'll work.  but it has some serious drawbacks. though I'm not fully versed on the latest version. it *was* and may still be the case where transactions are full table locking.
[12:24:22] <jb0t> this is really unperformant in a web app
[12:24:43] <uskerine> in any case moving from sqlite to mysql or postgres is quite simple
[12:25:00] <uskerine> you just replace the driver, maybe some minor changes, but they are really minor
[12:25:02] <uskerine> syntax is the same
[12:25:36] <jb0t> if you are using a db abstraction, it's easier. but even then, there can be some niggles.
[12:25:54] <uskerine> what I like most about sqlite is the backup
[12:26:01] <jb0t> depends on the complexity of what you are doing i suppose.  simple use cases migrate easily.
[12:26:03] <uskerine> "cp myfile.db mybackup.db"
[12:26:26] <jb0t> postgres :  pg_dump -d mydb -f mydb.sql
[12:26:27] <uskerine> I am doing simple stuff
[12:26:35] <jb0t> :)
[12:27:58] <jb0t> sqlite can be very convenient for rapid prototyping in a local env where setting up a full blown RDBMS is prohibitive.
[12:28:22] <jb0t> i wouldn't touch it without an abstraction though
[12:28:34] <uskerine> that's why I am using it
[12:29:01] <jb0t> what language is your app in?
[12:29:22] <jb0t> python. sorry.
[12:29:26] <jb0t> a framework?
[12:29:59] <uskerine> No I am not using a framework
[12:30:05] <uskerine> I am doing everything in AJAX
[12:30:23] <uskerine> so the backend just services request (add and user, list customers, etc.)
[12:30:27] <uskerine> simple stuff
[12:30:42] <uskerine> so you just get the fields from the CGI
[12:30:43] <jb0t> you should look at some of the micro frameworks.  they can make your life much easier.
[12:30:53] <uskerine> ensure that you have everything and make the request
[12:31:17] <uskerine> I was looking for gunicorn and some WSGI library (i think they are called WSGI)
[12:31:19] <jb0t> flask or bottle  are both good.  even werkzeug by itself can help a ton
[12:31:20] <uskerine> I also read about django
[12:31:46] <uskerine> but at the end most of the time is spent in the front end
[12:32:05] <uskerine> maybe I am doing something wrong, but I spent 90% time in the front end and 10% in the backend
[12:32:19] <uskerine> and in the frontend most of the time you are learning/wondering how to use jQuery plugins
[12:32:40] <uskerine> and how those interact with the theme you just purchased/downloaded or whatever
[12:32:56] <uskerine> so a framework might help less in that scenario (my humble opinion, I am far from being an expert)
[12:32:58] <jb0t> i wouldn't say that. still though, there are probably lot's things you probably don't account for and the frameworks will handle for you. as well as giving you room to grow and consume new features you don't need just yet.
[12:33:19] <jb0t> as for easy. flask and bottle both have hello world intros.  it doesn't get much easier.
[12:33:21] <uskerine> yeah I agree, but for this one I wanted to do something really simple to show
[12:33:45] <uskerine> so it was faster to just use CGI and plain Python
[12:33:51] <uskerine> Python is actually really easy to work with
[12:33:57] <jb0t> bottle is a single python file. the definition of simple :)
[12:34:04] <uskerine> my last (and only) web application was done in Java, and it was much more complex to learn
[12:34:14] <uskerine> I'll check those ones
[12:35:23] <jb0t> you'll be glad you did
[12:39:41] <uskerine> bottle seems cool
[12:40:26] <jb0t> yep. be sure to compare to flask.  both are tiny. flask is just a little bigger, but with a larger feature set.
[12:40:34] <jb0t> see which suits you
[12:41:20] <jb0t> i've used both. and django.  i like all of them.  each can be more appropriate than the other depending on the scope of a project.
[12:43:52] <uskerine> what webserver does bottle need?
[12:43:52] <jb0t> if you truly want to be masochistic, but slightly less so than you are now by doing it ALL yourself.. at least use werkzeug.  it's not a framework, but more of a utility toolkit well suited for simple web apps.
[12:44:12] <uskerine> jb0t, using CGI is by far much easier than you think
[12:45:20] <jb0t> it can use any webserver. http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/deployment.html#switching-the-server-backend    i've used cherrypy.  you can use CGI with it if you like..
[12:46:50] <uskerine> I will end up using bottle, just for this small stuff I just started typing. I did not know anything about Python last week.
[12:47:15] <uskerine> just to show you that doing it iwthout frameworks is not so complex: http://pastebin.com/zxQLnYQH   this is a service to add an user
[12:48:49] <uskerine> I use HTTP auth from apache (really convenient)
[12:52:31] <jb0t> yeah. works. can quickly get unruly though if the app grows beyond the most simplistic one off.
[12:53:15] <jb0t> bottle just gives you some core features that help a ton.  url routing, templates, form utils and server bindings.
[12:53:31] <jb0t> and structure.
[12:56:44] <uskerine> I'll look for it
[12:57:01] <uskerine> for this stuff I am doing this cgi way is enough, it is just adding users and doing really basic queries
[12:57:19] <uskerine> for the presentation I did a trick so I have a single html and dynamically loads html with an AJAX request
[12:57:31] <uskerine> so I have small chunks of HTML in separate files loaded with AJAX
[12:58:08] <jb0t> cool.  yeah have a look.  no need to reinvent the wheel when you don't have to.
[12:58:20] <uskerine> sure I will do it
[12:58:32] <uskerine> I did not know bottle
[12:58:51] <uskerine> I was recommended other options in Python I did not like them (looking at the code and not understanding what is going on means that the framework is not so easy)
[12:59:02] <uskerine> but bottle seems straightforward
[12:59:40] <uskerine> and definitively I do not need django, I start from a theme in bootstrap and use bootstrap plugins, so backend is easier
[13:00:54] <laravelnewbie2> Hi, how to get this code :   $('.pronamic_cookie_position_top').appendTo('#headerfull');

[13:03:42] <laravelnewbie2> I might but the code in wrong file?
[13:04:00] <laravelnewbie2> I just put it in the header.php file for try

[13:04:54] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm currently using addClass and removeClass to toggle my navigation on and off (narrow displays, not desktop). would anyone be able to guide me as to how i could change it so that it 'slides out'? i'm thinking of a sliding reveal, as opposed to it actually moving. thanks in advance: http://activeliving.lifemc.co.uk/static/
[13:05:16] <laravelnewbie2> tectonic : empty
[13:06:01] <tectonic> laravelnewbie2: if $('.pronamic_cookie_position_top') doesn't show anything in your Chrome JS console, then it's not on the page
[13:07:24] <laravelnewbie2> ok.. hmm.. I put it in header.php maybe try another php file?
[13:13:29] <laravelnewbie2> I need to grab DIV from plugin.php file and from the header.php file
[13:14:17] <laravelnewbie2> I do that in jquery code.. but where to put the code,, cause right now the jquery code doesnt find the DIVS from those php files
[13:14:49] <laravelnewbie2> when I put the jquery code in header.php file or the plugin.php file
[15:10:14] <ilhami> hey
[15:10:24] <ilhami> it's bad to put the user id in a cookie with javascript?
[15:12:42] <forQuery> so when i use a jquery selector... it equals [iframe#docCanvas2, context: iframe#docCanvas2...  and works
[15:12:50] <Terminus> ilhami: what uid? the one that's stored in your db? i would say yes. you only want to store the session id in a cookie.
[15:12:51] <forQuery> but, when i use a chached selector... it equals [iframe#docCanvas2, context: document, selector: "#docCanvas2" and fails
[15:13:03] <forQuery> does anyone know how to convert the second selector into the same thing as the first selector?
[15:14:24] <ilhami> Terminus, I will need to use the user ID to query the DB though. :P
[15:15:37] <Terminus> ilhami: session id gets passed to your server, server looks up which uid is associated with the sid.
[15:16:07] <ilhami> Terminus, fine. I have stored a token in my db and also in a cookie. I can use that token to look up the user I guess.. :P
[15:16:09] <ilhami> hope that's fine
[15:16:51] <Terminus> ilhami: every proper web framework out there has a decent method of handling sessions. just use those.
[15:17:04] <ilhami> Terminus, I wrote my own session handler. I am sorry. :)
[15:17:29] <Terminus> =P
[15:18:03] <forQuery> the problem im having is... i cache the selector before the init function...   but then, when i try to use the cached selector, it doesnt work.  because, the context: seems different than if i use the selector without caching
[15:52:29] <isthisreallife> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined  why i get this error mesage even though jquery is loaded
[15:52:41] <isthisreallife> and when i type same thing in console it works
[15:57:06] <rcyr> isthisreallife: Order matters.
[15:57:18] <rcyr> Be sure you include jQuery before anything that uses it.
[15:58:20] <isthisreallife> thanks
[16:19:41] <craftbynick> Hi, I am not really understanding too well how this (http://pastebin.com/exgRxL8j) code base works.  It is working thats for sure just need help understanding how its working if someone can help.  Thanks.
[16:39:32] <fahadash> craftbynick: That is solely definition of "working"
[16:39:35] <vacho> should this work?? http://pastie.org/10181776
[16:39:52] <fahadash> I can have a code that is throwing tons of exception, but that could just be the acceptable behavior
[16:40:55] <vacho> can someone please look at my paste?
[16:43:29] <fahadash> vacho: It looks like it does
[16:43:42] <fahadash> as long as you include jquery script tag *before* the js code
[16:43:48] <fahadash> oh wait
[16:44:11] <fahadash> also wrap around your code inside <script type="text/javascript"> // your code
[16:44:12] <fahadash> </script>
[16:44:42] <fahadash> and add another <script> tag that includes jquery js file, either from a CDN or your own local
[17:15:21] <craftbynick> fahadash: actually all I am trying to do is make it where if the input value is 97% or higher then the popup module should come up... currently its set to 100% http://pastebin.com/fNviKtqB
[17:48:23] <iam> http://pastebin.com/wVjzurr6 i've been trying to debug this for a while but still have no idea how to fix it
[17:48:37] <iam> in the image, the arrow class is not being detected
[17:48:45] <iam> so when i click the arrow it doesn't do anything
[17:49:08] <iam> (on 179)
[17:49:47] <iam> but when i take the contents of folders and put it in a separate file everything works perfectly
[17:51:17] <iam> as seen here
[17:51:17] <iam> http://jsfiddle.net/dkzos3Lm/
[17:55:46] <iam> i think i have an idea as to what the problem is
[17:55:50] * iam will look in to this
[18:00:19] <iam> nope absolutely no idea
[18:00:25] <iam> even the generated page works
[18:00:48] <iam> but when it's live it doesn't work at all
[18:01:25] <user_corrupt> I have an HTML button with the following attributes:         class="blink" onclick="setInterval(blinker, 200)      and below that I have the following bit of script: http://pastie.org/10181835 the onclick event works, but I am trying to figure out how to pass it an argument that will define which button class to target for the effect...
[18:02:41] <iam> http://pastebin.com/D2JUeyck
[18:02:50] <iam> this is what it generates, and it works
[18:03:02] <iam> but when it is actually on the page it doesn't...
[18:04:15] <iam> jb0t: are you still here :P
[18:14:24] <iam> this is so weird
[18:15:37] <iam> it also works when i manually put the code in the div
[18:16:09] <iam> the code that i got from that same div by reading the page's source
[18:16:11] <iam> ...

[21:30:58] <michaelwheldon> hey all, been banging my head against this one for a few hours now. I’m having an issue with mousenter on nested elements. hoping someone can help (also I’m new to this group so feel free to yell at me if I’m not framing my question right ;) )!
[21:32:15] <michaelwheldon> $(".front-cta").mouseenter(function () {
[21:32:15] <michaelwheldon>     $('.front-call-bottom').show();
[21:32:17] <michaelwheldon>      $('.front-call').hide();
[21:32:18] <michaelwheldon> }).mouseleave(function () {
[21:32:19] <michaelwheldon>     $('.front-call-bottom').hide();
[21:32:20] <michaelwheldon>     $('.front-call').show();
[21:32:21] <michaelwheldon> });
[21:33:42] <michaelwheldon> im targetting my wrapper correctly (.front-cta) but for some reason, possibly due to how nested down it is in my drupal block, it will not work (it does work if i target a top level element in the dom or any img)

[21:36:02] <VectorX> hi guys, having some trouble with my code, when you click on the top number for scores, it will show a input box http://jsfiddle.net/1ygo5d73/5/
[21:36:16] <VectorX> but if you click out and back in it adds input code into that box
[21:36:39] <VectorX> like the span click event is getting added to the newly created inputbox, how can i prevent that
[21:44:20] <VectorX> im sure its something simple but i cant see how its getting the event
[21:57:26] <michaelwheldon> how can I target a wildcard? i.e. $(".front-block-*”). which would target front-block-1, front-block-2, etc?
[21:59:55] <Uhkis> ?g css wildcard selector
[21:59:56] <b-ot> Uhkis: css selectors - wildcard * in CSS for classes - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5110249/wildcard-in-css-for-classes
[23:00:58] <bambanx_> how i can select all with .text() != 0
[23:06:01] <hassoon> will doing the try.jquery.com instructions teach me ajax too? :s
[23:19:57] <Cork> bambanx_: you can't really do that
[23:20:07] <Cork> bambanx_: the dom don't have selectors for text
[23:20:08] <bambanx_> why?
[23:20:18] <bambanx_> using length or some?
[23:20:22] <bambanx_> filtering?
[23:20:33] <Cork> if the element is completely empty (no children or space)
[23:20:37] <Cork> you can use :empty
[23:20:52] <bambanx_> i am trying some like this without sucess : $(document).ready(function() {
[23:20:52] <bambanx_>         $("li")
[23:20:53] <bambanx_>             .filter(function(index) {
[23:20:53] <bambanx_>                 $(this).text() != "0";
[23:20:53] <bambanx_>             })
[23:20:53] <bambanx_>             .css("font-size", "24px");
[23:20:55] <bambanx_>     });
[23:20:57] <Cork> if it isn't completely empty and has children, then you need to rethink the design
[23:21:01] <bambanx_> ssorry for the paste
[23:21:04] <bambanx_> i mistaked
[23:21:05] <Cork> bambanx_: don't paste code in the channel
[23:21:21] <bambanx_> http://pastebin.com/zfSqbJw8
[23:21:56] <Cork> bambanx_: ya, but like i said, that isn't a dom selector (and really slow)
[23:22:27] <bambanx_> i am new man, what aproach can u recommend me?
[23:22:29] <bambanx_> use empty?
[23:22:30] <Cork> cause that means it has to find all lis in the page and then loop them, serialize the content of the element, and then check that value
[23:22:45] <Cork> no as you want to check for
[23:22:46] <bambanx_> just i wanna select all places where are things writed
[23:22:53] <Cork> '0' and not empty
[23:23:09] <Cork> i would recommend adding a class to those elements as the content is added
[23:23:11] <VectorX> asking again, having some trouble with my code, when you click on the top number for scores, it will show an input box http://jsfiddle.net/1ygo5d73/5/ but if you click out and back in another input code is appended inside the input box, how can i prevent this
[23:23:27] <bambanx_> ok thanks Cork
[23:24:24] <Cork> VectorX: $('this') => $(this)
[23:25:18] <Cork> VectorX: also you prob need to remove the old input if that is what you have problem with
[23:25:28] <Cork> (you can't append anything inside an input field)
[23:39:30] <VectorX> Cork thanks got it, updated code, can you tell me if it is optimal or if i should do anything better, http://jsfiddle.net/1ygo5d73/6/ basically click add new value click away and previous value is updated, this will be part of a ajax later which updated the db then gets the value from db back and updates the span but testing concept
[23:40:34] <Cork> VectorX: to start with, you should delegate the blur handler (and not bind it on every input)
[23:40:46] <Cork> but that is mainly for readability
[23:41:22] <Cork> looks fine except for that
[23:41:38] <VectorX> let me check on delegate
[23:43:00] <Cork> ?api delegate
[23:43:00] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[23:51:17] <VectorX> Cork is this ok http://jsfiddle.net/1ygo5d73/10/ ?
[23:51:44] <Cork> ugg, didn't notice that before
[23:52:01] <Cork> VectorX: never ever do class^=, class*= or similar
[23:52:14] <VectorX> no i just did that so both the scores get affected
[23:52:19] <Cork> if you have parts of a class you want to match, split the class name up
[23:52:45] <Cork> so in your case change ex class="score-teams" to class="score teams"
[23:53:07] <Cork> and when you used .score-teams do .score.teams
[23:53:18] <Cork> and when you want both just do .score
[23:53:23] <VectorX> got it
[23:54:01] <Cork> the reason for this is that browsers has optimizations for class selectors
[23:54:30] <Cork> and you work around them if you use class^= cause then you use the class attribute instead of the classes
