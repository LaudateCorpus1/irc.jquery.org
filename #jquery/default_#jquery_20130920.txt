[00:00:22] <__machine> Cork: so how do i check them all... since .length doesnt even work on objects and arrays?
[00:01:08] <_pingu> doug65536: no, I'm not sure. how can i analyze which part is the performance problem?
[00:01:34] <sylflo> is this possible to do a one page website with bootstrap and have horizontal scrolling ? I found some one page website with bootstrap but it's only vertical
[00:01:39] <raj> can I replace the .data() on an object instead of appending to it?
[00:01:53] <__machine> something like if (myvar || typeof myvar == 'array' && myvar.length || typeof myvar == 'object' && Object.keys(myvar).length) ... ?
[00:01:56] <doug65536> _pingu: well, there's using var st, en; st = new Date(); ... do stuff ... ; en = new Date(); console.log("time:", en-st);
[00:02:04] <doug65536> _pingu: or use a profiler, like chrome's
[00:03:14] <__machine> wow even that doesnt work because typoeof [] is "object"
[00:03:56] <doug65536> js> print([] instanceof Array)
[00:04:04] <b-ot> doug65536: true
[00:07:44] <Cork> __machine: you will have to build a quite complex check
[00:07:49] <__machine> doug65536: ok... but i cant use that style for "object" too? so... `if (myvar instanceof Array && myvar.length || somehow check if myvar is {} && Object.keys(myvar).length || myvar)` ... ?
[00:07:54] <Cork> __machine: so i would recommend writing a helper function
[00:08:13] <__machine> so jquery does not provide anything to do this?
[00:08:26] <Cork> jquery is mainly for dom manipulation
[00:08:41] <Cork> it only exposes functions that jquery needs internally
[00:08:57] <doug65536> __machine: don't forget one gotcha: typeof null === 'object'
[00:11:01] <__machine> so how do i test if a var is an "object" ?
[00:11:11] <Cork> typeof
[00:11:26] <__machine> but typeof [] also returns "object" ?
[00:12:09] <Cork> __machine: try something like: function isEmpty(val) { return (val == null) || ($.isArray(val) && val.length < 1) || ( typeof(val) == "Object" && Object.keys(val).length < 1); };
[00:12:19] <_pingu> doug65536: ok, I'll try. thanks
[00:12:23] <raj> do I have to removeData() to replace previously stored data with a new object?
[00:12:30] <raj> no one-shot method?
[00:12:44] <Cork> raj: not sure what you mean
[00:13:12] <Cork> raj: if you mean if you want to replace the data on the element, then no just overwrite it like you would any variable
[00:13:26] <raj> like $('#somediv').data({'test':'abc'}), and then later I just want $('#somediv').data({'test2':'xyz'})
[00:13:50] <raj> and i want {'test':'abc'} gone
[00:13:51] <Cork> raj: well if you after the second don't want test to be there yes you would
[00:14:10] <Cork> raj: though it sounds like your doing it the wrong way if you need that structure
[00:14:48] <raj> I just want to replace the values, but it's easier to just reapply the whole object to .data()
[00:14:54] <Cork> raj: a better option would be $('#somediv').data('myPlugin', {'test':'abc'})); $('#somediv').data('myPlugin', {'test2':'xyz'});
[00:15:13] <Cork> raj: you should not expect nothing else to be in there
[00:15:16] <Guest74559> hello
[00:15:20] <Cork> that tends to be a problem down the line
[00:15:32] <raj> what do you mean?
[00:15:35] <Cork> raj: when you need to store additional data on the element, and your old code blows it away all the time
[00:15:49] <raj> hmm
[00:15:51] <raj> I see
[00:16:10] <Cork> raj: $('#somediv').data('myPlugin1', {'something':'else'});
[00:16:18] <Cork> and when it tries to access it the data is cone
[00:16:24] <Cork> cause you did removeData() on the element
[00:16:53] <Cork> raj: you should always namespace your things or only touch the things you added
[00:17:03] <Cork> else you are bound to get conflicts down the line
[00:17:19] <raj> understood
[00:17:23] <raj> i corrected that
[00:17:37] <raj> thank you
[00:17:45] <Cork> np
[00:18:32] <raj> can I do $('#somediv').data({'myplugin': {'test':'abc'}}) and then with {'test2': 'xyz'}?
[00:18:39] <Cork> yes
[00:18:52] <Cork> raj: but why are you sending data an object
[00:19:00] <Cork> it is ('key', value)
[00:19:29] <Cork> so $('#somediv').data('myplugin', {'test':'abc'}) not $('#somediv').data({'myplugin': {'test':'abc'}})
[00:20:00] <raj> just in case that's what I already have
[00:20:02] <Cork> raj: i suspect $('#somediv').data({'myplugin': {'test':'abc'}}) will blow away all other data on the object just like remove (not sure there though)
[00:20:14] <raj> oh
[00:20:28] <Cork> unless $().data uses $.extend to loop over the object and merge them
[00:20:37] <xec> Cork: i think it should work
[00:20:50] <xec> Cork: docs say "An object of key-value pairs of data to update"
[00:20:54] <Cork> sounds like extra work for the browser anyway
[00:22:20] <raj> Cork, it doesn't blow it away, keeps it all
[00:22:27] <doug65536> cork __machine tiny bug above, typeof returns lowercase "object"
[00:22:32] <Cork> raj: ya, i just looked through the function
[00:22:41] <xec> it's not really necessary if you don't want to update multiple keys at the same time, but i don't think the perfomance would be noticably different
[00:22:46] <raj> amazing how that's faster for you then testing
[00:22:52] <raj> :)
[00:22:55] <raj> *than
[00:22:58] <Cork> raj: if name is an object, it runs extend on the name as the data
[00:23:58] <raj> cool
[00:23:59] <Cork> raj: it's cache[elmement_id][name] = data vs cache[element_id] = $.extend(cache[element_id], name);
[00:24:11] <Cork> the second will loop the objects in the cache
[00:24:16] <Cork> and merge in what's in name
[00:24:30] <Cork> the first just takes an object and sets the value from the data variable
[00:30:16] <martisj> so i've got this     $('a.add_connection, a.add_side_connection').live("click", function(e) {  and want to use .on() instead. we're on jquery 1.7.2. How can i listen for .add_side_connection with a parent of .sidebar_content and .add_connection with a parent of .find
[00:32:31] <Guest74559> I have a <li class="drag" data-id="1"><img src="img/int1.jpg" title="1" /></li>
[00:32:55] <Guest74559> And I'm using this: last_id=$("#slider li").find(":visible").filter(":last").data("id");
[00:33:08] <Guest74559> but returns undefined
[00:33:24] <martisj> should i just do this $('body').on('click', 'a.add_connection, a.add_side_connection', function(e) { ... } ?
[00:34:13] <TedMeister> Hi there, i have a JQM question, im trying to do something like this: $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open",{positionTo: 'body'});
[00:34:19] <TedMeister> or $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open",{positionTo: 'window'});
[00:34:31] <TedMeister> neither is working and the popup is being positioned to orign
[00:34:36] <TedMeister> which sucks if you are using a mobile
[00:35:28] <TedMeister> Anyone here that can tell me what i'm doing wrong, because when i look at the docs: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/popup/methods.html it telling me to do exactly this: $( ".selector" ).popup( "open", options );
[00:35:43] <TedMeister> where one of the options is positionTo	 The positioning to use.
[00:37:36] <TedMeister> The docs state that i can define the position in the link opening the popup, but there is not link for that, im doing it after a successful ajax call
[00:40:26] <emx> i have a div with an arbitrary height. i .animate() it with "height: 0". how do i animate it back to its original height? "height: ''" doesn't seem to cut it.
[00:43:36] <_pingu> doug65536: i did the profiling in chrome. deactivating the regex part of the script incresed speed from 20 to 0.4 percent. in internet explorer 9 from 20 to 3.5 percent. what do you recommend. you said the regex look not that bad
[00:45:23] <doug65536> _pingu: how much time though? how many seconds are we talking about. a split second?
[00:45:41] <mllie> What good libraries do we have that handle URLs?
[00:47:05] <_pingu> doug65536: i can see only percent columns. self and total
[00:48:15] <_pingu> doug65536: one moment i take a look in ie
[00:51:14] <anl_> Is the ckeditor class automatic on textareas?
[00:51:17] <_pingu> doug65536: the ie profiles shows 15.000 ms for that script
[00:51:43] <_pingu> doug65536: with regex activated
[00:53:17] <TedMeister> wtf
[00:53:23] <doug65536> _pingu: 15ms is probably the timer resolution. I doubt it can measure much less than that. that's 1 60th of a second
[00:53:31] <TedMeister> i even trying using a normal <a href for opening the window, still not able to get it to center to the window
[00:54:03] <_pingu> doug65536: 15000ms not 15ms. sorry
[00:54:17] <doug65536> _pingu: 15 seconds?!
[00:54:24] <_pingu> doug65536: yes.
[00:54:35] <doug65536> what is the length of the string?
[00:56:52] <_pingu> doug65536: 2547770
[00:58:50] <_pingu> doug65536: ie seems to be much slower than chrome
[00:59:49] <Gooder> I know $("#chart") means select the id=chart element, but what $("#chart", gadget.getView()) means?
[01:00:01] <Gooder> the second parameter is for?
[01:01:30] <doug65536> _pingu: 2.5MB string?
[01:02:17] <_pingu> doug65536: I don't know how much mb
[01:03:13] <doug65536> _pingu: js (implementation that I have tested) sucks at modifying strings - it has to build a new copy of the string each time it is changed
[01:03:24] <Blade> I have a form which submits when you press [enter] using jquery, now, if a browser has an auto complete and the user presses [enter] to select that auto complete, it submits the form. Is there anyway to check if the enter was pressed on a browser auto complete? That way I could make it not submit
[01:03:40] <doug65536> _pingu: for normal size strings it isn't bad. for massive strings, not good
[01:04:07] <doug65536> _pingu: how did you end up with a string that big? what are you doing with that?
[01:05:15] <emx> doug65536, the offset for 2^16 bits starts with 0 and ends with 65535. you got it wrong.
[01:05:36] <doug65536> emx: what?
[01:05:53] <emx> doug65536, just rename your nick to doug65535.
[01:06:06] <doug65536> 0 thru 65535 is 65536 different values
[01:06:28] <emx> yes, but that value never appears when coding.
[01:06:32] <emx> just do it :P
[01:08:03] <_pingu> doug65536: its shown in the side with syntax highlighting for some text. the highlighted text is surrounded by span tags, which have a click listener. thats all. a click on the highlighted text copies that part to a search field.
[01:08:40] <doug65536> _pingu: well, I am not too sure what to tell you... js sucks at manipulating large strings
[01:08:50] <doug65536> in chrome anyway
[01:08:58] <raj> does .attr('data', input) only take a string as input?
[01:09:03] <Blade> I have a form which submits when you press [enter] using jquery, now, if a browser has an auto complete and the user presses [enter] to select that auto complete, it submits the form. Is there anyway to check if the enter was pressed on a browser auto complete? That way I could make it not submit
[01:09:07] <doug65536> raj: no, any data type
[01:09:17] <doug65536> raj: oh, attr.
[01:09:21] <doug65536> raj: yeah, string
[01:09:28] <raj> k
[01:09:38] <doug65536> raj: not sure though
[01:09:39] <_pingu> doug65536: is it possible to work with one big regex? would that be better? or is there an in place search and replace?
[01:09:43] <Cork> raj: attr actually sets the content on the dom
[01:09:55] <Cork> raj: so yes you can only use strings, nothing else (and no object references)
[01:10:15] <Cork> raj: that is why jquery have the data cache
[01:10:20] <doug65536> raj: you probably want .data('name', value) which can take any data type
[01:10:20] <gavrochel> I want to get the data value from the last hidden element using this: $("#slider").find(":hidden").filter(":last").data("id") but it is not working
[01:10:26] <gavrochel> help please
[01:10:36] <Cork> raj: could you can serialize the data you have and attache that with attr
[01:11:01] <Cork> raj: .attr('data-some', JSON.strinfiy(input)) should work just fine
[01:11:14] <Cork> (as long as it inst a dom reference :) )
[01:11:37] <nitram201000> hi all. can anyone tell me whether jquery mobile needs an internet connection to work when used in conjunction with PhoneGap. I have a simple jquery mobile page (no phone gap code yet). When I build an iOS app using Phonegap, the links dont work unless WiFi is on on the iphone?
[01:11:40] <raj> Cork, it's cuz I was thinking of originally loading the html page with the data object as a data-* attribute of an element
[01:11:55] <Blade> I have a form which submits when you press [enter] using jquery, now, if a browser has an auto complete and the user presses [enter] to select that auto complete, it submits the form. Is there anyway to check if the enter was pressed on a browser auto complete? That way I could make it not submit
[01:12:02] <Cork> gavrochel: are you looking for$("#slider").find(":hidden").last().data('id') ?
[01:12:23] <Cork> raj: just use html escaped json and it should work fine
[01:12:44] <Cork> raj: .data parses json from the data- attribute by default
[01:13:05] <doug65536> _pingu: my first attempt at speeding it up would involve doing .match instead of .replace, remembering all the names, then splitting out the segments into an array of strings, using indexOf to find the matches... it wouldn't be trivial
[01:14:10] <doug65536> _pingu: in other words... you could use the matches and indexOf to find the segments that match, then replace on that small thing. and instead of modifying in place (and copying the string), you just replace on the match and build an array of segments. then join at the end
[01:14:31] <gavrochel> Cork I want to get data fro the first wich is hidden
[01:14:51] <Cork> gavrochel: so s/.last()/.first()/
[01:15:08] <doug65536> _pingu: what's killing you is js is building a whole new string every time it changes it
[01:15:12] <gavrochel> What?
[01:15:27] <Cork> gavrochel: just replace last with first in that line
[01:16:37] <Blade> Is it possible to check if enter was pressed on a browser auto complete/
[01:16:40] <Blade> in a form
[01:17:12] <doug65536> Blade: what kind of autocomplete? html5?
[01:17:14] <_pingu> doug65536: var text = 'aaa'; text = text.replace(/a/g, 'b') would build text 3 times? thats bad
[01:17:17] <Cork> Blade: enter would trigger the submit on the form
[01:17:24] <Blade> Browser auto complete
[01:17:34] <Blade> I have a form which submits when you press [enter] using jquery, now, if a browser has an auto complete and the user presses [enter] to select that auto complete, it submits the form. Is there anyway to check if the enter was pressed on a browser auto complete? That way I could make it not submit
[01:17:58] <doug65536> Blade: users should use tab to select the autocomplete value. I suppose the chance of people knowing that is 0.001%
[01:18:24] <gavrochel> Ok but how to get the last visibel element? $("#slider").find(":visible").filter(":last").data("id");
[01:18:28] <Cork> Blade: you could check if focus is on the autocomplete element when the submit happens
[01:18:29] <Blade> trying to make it user friendly as a lot use enter
[01:18:31] <gavrochel> It says undefined
[01:18:45] <Blade> cork: how do I get the auto complete element though?
[01:18:55] <Blade> cork: its on browser auto completes like chrome/firefox
[01:19:02] <doug65536> Blade: you could just kill the enter functionality and put a keydown handler on the input and do event.preventDefault() and maybe event.stopPropagation()
[01:19:12] <Blade> cork: not "auto complete" but like how it suggests text you've put in previous forms
[01:19:13] <Cork> gavrochel: are you really looking for :visible; as in all elements that doens't have display: none; or opacity: 0 or visibility: hidden ?
[01:19:22] <Cork> gavrochel: cause that is all :visible/:hidden does
[01:19:42] <Cork> Blacklite: document.activeElement
[01:19:43] <doug65536> Blade: if event.which === 13
[01:19:56] <Cork> doug65536: won't work
[01:20:04] <Blade> I know, I do use that, your mis understanding my question I think
[01:20:07] <Cork> the submit event triggers before the keyup on the element
[01:20:18] <doug65536> Cork: I said keydown right?
[01:20:32] <steinarts> Blade: do you want to mimic the browsers autocomplete or do you want to trigger it ?
[01:20:36] <Cork> doug65536: not sure if that works cross browser
[01:21:00] <Blade> steinarts: let me see if I can make it a screenshot example so you guys can better understand what I'm trying to explain one minute
[01:21:04] <gavrochel> I have a ul with li and some li are hidden {display:none}. I want to get the data form first visible, last visible, first hidden and last hidden
[01:21:06] <funhouse>  Does anyone know of any decent particle plugins? Or maybe other cool stuff like rain and fire?
[01:21:23] <doug65536> Cork: why wouldn't it
[01:23:34] <Blade> steinarts: http://i.imgur.com/y6K2d1g.png I want to make it NOT submit the form on [enter] if the user chooses one of those with enter
[01:24:03] <Blade> so auto suggest is a better word I suppose
[01:24:47] <doug65536> Blade: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Xh2Ft/
[01:26:45] <Blade> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/Xh2Ft/3/ as you can see I made it alert when enter is pressed, now try pressing enter on an auto suggest, still alerts.
[01:27:04] <doug65536> Blade: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Xh2Ft/6/
[01:27:57] <doug65536> Blade: I named it email so pressing the first letter of your email will probably show some autosuggest
[01:28:57] <Blade> still think your mis understanding though, I want it to submit on enter, but not if your choosing from an auto suggest from pressing enter
[01:29:11] <doug65536> Blade: good luck with the html5 implementation of autocomplete. it is total crap
[01:29:37] <Blade> I'm not using html5 auto suggest, I'm talking about how browsers have auto suggest in their broswers
[01:29:47] <doug65536> Blade: I suppose you could watch for cursor down...
[01:30:06] <Blade> Some users use [enter] though so >.>
[01:30:17] <doug65536> Blade: yeah? how
[01:30:55] <Blade> down arrow key, select the auto suggestion, press enter
[01:30:56] <Blade> ?
[01:31:04] <Cork> doug65536: cause browsers fiddle quite a bit with event orders for form and form elements
[01:31:13] <Cork> doug65536: it has bitten be a few times before
[01:31:49] <_pingu> doug65536: var text = 'aaa'; text = text.replace(/a/g, 'b') would build text 3 times? did i understand that right?
[01:32:04] <doug65536> _pingu: not necessarily, but most likely
[01:32:26] <_pingu> doug65536: ok, thanks! :-)
[01:32:53] <anl_> Is there a way to have an alternative config when using <textarea class="ckeditor" name="foo"></textarea>?
[01:33:11] <Cork> anl_: config?
[01:33:16] <Cork> anl_: what config?
[01:33:24] <anl_> config.js
[01:33:41] <Cork> anl_: what this is?
[01:33:47] <anl_> Maybe I can check class before doing CKEDITOR.editorConfig?
[01:33:58] <doug65536> Blade: so I said, "I suppose you could watch for cursor down", then you said, "some users use the enter key"... did I miss something
[01:34:00] <Cork> ok so you want to change config for ckeditor?
[01:34:16] <Cork> anl_: that should prob be asked in a channel for ckeditor
[01:34:48] <Blade> Yes as clicking and pressing the enter key are 2 different things. I'm currently searching for google for the answer but not even sure if its possible as the auto suggestion is in the browser itself
[01:34:59] <Blade> http://i.imgur.com/y6K2d1g.png see this picture to understand what I mean
[01:35:43] <doug65536> Blade: I know exactly what you mean. chrome doesn't submit if you hit enter in the autocomplete. which browser?
[01:36:02] <Blade> I made my form submit on [enter] using jquery
[01:36:19] <doug65536> Blade: then don't do that
[01:36:34] <Blade> I need to check in the function if enter was pressed while selecting an auto fill/auto suggest
[01:36:52] <doug65536> Blade: that stupid autocomplete it a total hack that browsers stick in there to be "helpful" without any proper events
[01:37:23] <Blade> Alright, so its not possible on jquery right?
[01:37:39] <doug65536> Blade: don't watch for enter press. make a submit button
[01:37:53] <Blade> alright
[01:37:57] <Blade> I appreciate your help a lot man
[01:37:57] <doug65536> Blade: an invisible one will probably work
[01:38:12] <Cork> depends on how you make it invisible
[01:38:15] <Blade> why invisible?
[01:38:17] <Cork> display: none doesn't work in ie
[01:38:35] <Cork> Blade: : background: transparent; color: transparent;
[01:38:36] <doug65536> Blade: well, if you wanted it visible, didn't you already have automatic submit on enter?
[01:39:13] <Blade> I do yes, but if your saying not to auto submit on enter, and to use a submit button instead why would I hide it? Or am I missing something
[01:39:14] <doug65536> Blade: one that won't submit when they press enter in autocomplete already
[01:39:23] <doug65536> Blade: don't hide it...
[01:39:39] <Cork> Blade: you can make it invisible if you wan't want the user to see it :)
[01:39:48] <Cork> Blade: but ya, normally it isn't a good idea
[01:39:49] <doug65536> Blade: if you already had a submit button, then enter already submitted the form. and it already did the right thing when using autocomplete
[01:40:12] <doug65536> Blade: so I extrapolated that you didn't have/want a submit button from that
[01:41:14] <Blade> alright man
[01:41:16] <Blade> I appreciate it a lot
[01:41:20] <Blade> thank you :)
[01:41:22] <doug65536> Blade: maybe you didn't know. sorry I assumed

[01:43:27] <anl_> Cork: The problem was that I did not know which of all ckeditor channels I should pick
[01:43:31] <gavrochel> Can someone help me in selecting a element with the :last selector? http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/B3pMB/
[01:43:52] <DRSK> I'm checking how close I am to the bottom of the page, and if I'm close I'm changing some CSS values. This works, but the problem is on the way "up" again, leaving the "close" area I'm trying to revert these CSS-changes, but the thing is the script is run on scroll, so the code changing the css "back" gets run basically each scroll event. Using .one() doesn't work because that'd only trigger it once, I need only to trigger it "once" after have been down
[01:43:52] <DRSK>  "close".
[01:44:02] <DRSK> Wow, that explanation deserves a gold medal btw
[01:44:46] <Cork> anl_: tried #fckeditor ?
[01:45:03] <anl_> Ah, it has that name, taking a look then, thanks
[01:45:09] <Cork> gavrochel: what do you want from it?
[01:45:22] <anl_> Wow, now I have a mate I can discuss this with, there was one person in #fckeditor
[01:45:26] <Cork> anl_: it used to be named fckeditor
[01:45:31] <anl_> I know
[01:45:40] <Cork> anl_: though have you checked #ckeditor ?
[01:46:15] <anl_> I tried #ckeditor but felt a bit alone
[01:46:42] <Cork> anl_: tried there forum?
[01:47:12] <anl_> I must admit I have not, you talked about a ckeditor channel, did you not?
[01:47:35] <Cork> anl_: ya, but some projects don't have lively irc channels
[01:47:43] <Cork> ckeditor might be one of them
[01:47:59] <Cork> there forum looks fairly active though
[01:48:21] <anl_> I think I would pick stack overflow over any forum btw
[01:48:29] <anl_> Over any other forum that is :)
[01:48:44] <anl_> I can ask in there
[01:49:00] <Cork> anl_: well stack has a tendency to get wrong information though
[01:49:08] <anl_> ok
[01:49:08] <Cork> lots of guesses and hunches
[01:49:14] <doug65536> gavrochel: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B3pMB/4/
[01:49:16] <anl_> Isnt it the same guys sitting in there?
[01:49:19] <Cork> works well for generic questions
[01:49:30] <gavrochel> Cork I want to get the data from the last element wich can be hidden or visible   http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/B3pMB/1/
[01:49:37] <DRSK> Cork » any tip how to only do stuff "once" within a scroll event? Not .one() once but once when scrolled past a specific "point"?
[01:50:04] <Cork> anl_: the channel or forum tends to be visited by ppl actually working on the project
[01:50:06] <doug65536> DRSK: use .off to detach the handler once your conditions are met and you've done your thing
[01:50:10] <anl_> ok
[01:50:28] <Cork> anl_: at least to my knowledge, so there comments tend to be a little higher hit to bull ratio
[01:50:34] <anl_> hehe
[01:51:01] <doug65536> gavrochel: first thing: nth-child needs to work with children, so you need ul: not li:
[01:51:12] <Cork> ah
[01:51:24] <DRSK> doug65536 » trying to ;p Not very successfully though
[01:51:29] <doug65536> gavrochel: 2nd, jquery wasnt loading in the fiddle, 3rd, use 5 if you want the 5th child, not n+5
[01:51:48] <Cork> gavrochel: so .find(':visible').first() .find(':visible').last() .find(':hidden').first() .find(':hidden').last()
[01:51:52] <Cork> gavrochel: should cover that
[01:52:21] <doug65536> DRSK: did you show code? did I miss it?
[01:52:36] <Cork> DRSK: you could have a variable and check if it's true/false
[01:53:25] <Cork> DRSK: i usually use that for infinite scroll
[01:53:35] <Cork> where i have a pending variable for if i'm fetchin more posts
[01:54:44] <doug65536> gavrochel: wait a minute... sorry 3rd thing is wrong

[01:58:31] <anl_> Hm, ckeditor was not big on SO
[01:58:41] <noaXess> hello
[01:59:09] <noaXess> i want use selectable widget's to post over a form.. so if a item is selected and form will be posted, tha value of the selected item should be posted..
[01:59:38] <noaXess> di i need hidden input fields and on selected state write value in that hidden field or is there a simpler way?
[02:00:34] <anl_> Hehe, the editor used in the ckeditor forum is a... ckeditor
[02:02:07] <anl_> Wow, cannot paste < in there ;)
[02:07:10] <SobhanHzk> hey!
[02:08:36] <Ricaz> How does <input id='file' type='file' /> work with events? $('#file').change() doesn't seem to fire when I select a file.
[02:12:22] <glambert> can I loop back in $(this).parent()s to find a <tr>?
[02:13:50] <Ricaz> glambert, yes
[02:14:15] <Ricaz> glambert, $(this).parent().find('tr'); iirc
[02:14:33] <Cork> glambert: are you looking for a tr parent?
[02:14:41] <glambert> wouldn't that find a tr within the parent of this?
[02:14:42] <Cork> if that is the case you want closest('tr')
[02:14:51] <Cork> glambert: yes
[02:14:52] <glambert> Cork, that looks about right
[02:16:55] <glambert> don't suppose anyone knows of a google chrome extensions dev channel anywhere?
[02:21:52] <sylflo> hi
[02:22:42] <sylflo> is this a good idea to do a horizontal and vertical scrolling for one page website with bootstrap ?
[02:33:04] <sylflo> I know i can do slider for horizontal. But I don't like it because if javascript is not enabled then you can't navigate on the website
[02:36:14] <Cork> sylflo: are you talking about replacing the scrollbars?
[02:40:02] <sylflo> No, the problem I had it's I want to do that with bootstrap http://peronczyk.com/
[02:40:50] <Cork> sylflo: well as long as you get a working page without js i don't see a problem
[02:41:22] <sylflo> but I find a lot of tutorial only with vertical sliding with bootstrap like that http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0XLB528
[02:43:46] <sylflo> ok I'll try, I think I find a way.
[03:09:45] <MACscr> I need a little help refactoring some code. I originally made my processValues function to where it would do the total for the section the "Total My Score" would be in, but now i need it actually at the bottom of the entire page and total up each section, but keep their scores still unique to their section. Right now im getting the same result in each section. http://jsfiddle.net/zm2Gq/6/
[03:10:03] <MACscr> i know why its doing that, but i am not sure how I should correct it. =P
[03:13:03] <MACscr> doug65536: if you get bored, you can jump in on this one. Though dont feel obligated at all.
[03:13:58] <doug65536> MACscr: looking
[03:24:16] <MPer> Hello. I got a strange problem, the .post call throws an error (WRONG_THIS_ERR) when building the params. I think it has to be the success handler function but it's so easy, just a if with two alerts ("success", "no success").
[03:25:22] <ravenzz> ?demo @ MPer
[03:25:23] <b-ot> MPer: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:28:08] <doug65536> MACscr: is this what you meant http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zm2Gq/16/
[03:28:39] <doug65536> MACscr: see console log output - it prints out what it got
[03:29:46] <MACscr> doug65536: pretty much, though didnt need a total of all sections. Just a total per section
[03:30:02] <MACscr> though i can work with that code to get that result
[03:30:08] <MACscr> thanks bud. i really appreciate it
[03:30:15] <doug65536> MACscr: you may notice that I changed the "made up" attribute names to have a data- prefix
[03:30:38] <doug65536> MACscr: attributes that begin with data- are reserved for programmer use and are guaranteed to never conflict with future attribute names
[03:30:55] <MACscr> ah, makes sense
[03:37:34] <anew> does anyone have a recomendation - you know on pinterest you can enter a url and it will select an image and upload it
[03:37:38] <anew> is there a jq plugin to do this
[03:42:38] <MACscr> anew: obviously you need more than just a jquery plugin
[03:42:55] <MACscr> you need some server side processing, etc
[03:47:25] <anew> hmmm
[03:47:35] <anew> yeah but the client side part
[03:47:49] <anew> there isnt something to view the image from the url u are wanting
[03:48:27] <MACscr> i dont use pinterest, so i have no idea what you are talking about. seems lame. =P
[03:53:27] <sahbeewah> that's also done server-side
[03:53:53] <anew> sahbeewah it's all serverside ?
[03:54:48] <sahbeewah> their server would retrieve the url, make a http request to your url from their server (they use python/django), then presumably parse the dom using something like beautifulsoup
[03:55:00] <sahbeewah> then they'll return the image urls they found back to you
[03:55:26] <anew> hmmm
[03:55:27] <anew> damn
[03:55:31] <anew> sounds like a lot of work
[03:58:35] <sahbeewah> yeah it's a lot of work to get it working to a professional level... but then they have a lot of devs
[03:58:37] <sahbeewah> and moolah
[03:59:09] <sahbeewah> try looking at http://embed.ly/
[04:28:19] <noregret> I have an <a> with a long url, what can I do to truncate it and at teh same time be able to copy it and use it ?
[04:28:45] <Velveeta> run it through a shortener like bit.ly or something?
[04:30:58] <noregret> Velveeta: well, i want it to be visible too, e.g. it shows the first 10 chars and if it's more, it adds 3 dots.. and when the dots are clicked, it shows the full url.. something like that.. is there a plugin for that or something
[04:33:07] <clime> Velveeta: do you remember the chrome-not-rerenderring-after-dom-updated-with-ajax-loaded-content case? $(window).trigger.scroll() did not helper:(. I also found out that the issue disappear if I dont attach my css3 spinner to the content that should be replaced.
[04:33:11] <Velveeta> not sure off the top of my head, we have a plugin internally for that sort of thing, but it's not anything i can share.. you can try searching for 'jquery ellipse plugin', i just did and got several results, but can't speak for how good any of them are
[04:33:27] <clime> * $(window).trigger('scroll') i meant
[04:33:37] <MPer> ravenzz, Sorry, took a while: http://www.qr-g.com/index.php login as test test, press the edit button beneath 'Pages' and press 'Speichern' on the right side. Page is in german.
[04:33:45] <Velveeta> clime: if you manually scroll the page does it fix it?
[04:33:55] <clime> Velveeta: yes
[04:34:26] <Velveeta> try wrapping your $(window).trigger('scroll') in a 1ms timeout: setTimeout(function () { $(window).trigger('scroll'); }, 1);
[04:37:23] <Velveeta> holy shit how did it get to be so late in the morning already? i gotta grab a shower and get outta here
[04:37:53] <clime> Velveeta: not even that helped, even with higher timeout
[04:38:25] <clime> Velveeta: xD, ill just remove the spinner, thx for help man
[04:38:27] <ShaneHudson> Hi all. Just diving into jquery plugin dev. Is there something I should know about with regards to logging to console? Doesn't seem to work, despite getting to the line fine
[04:38:45] <Velveeta> clime: no problem, i gotta get outta here for now anyway :)
[04:39:06] <TTomiK> I have a problem with UI Tabs... For some reason my parent url (www.domain.com) gets loaded into tab -container
[04:39:16] <Velveeta> shanehudson: console.log should work just the same in a plugin as it does anywhere else
[04:39:58] <ShaneHudson> Velveeta: odd. Ok thanks
[04:40:05] <TTomiK> I have copied the source code from ui -example and changed the href and div ID and added tab-script
[04:41:13] <TTomiK> anynone's got an idea why this happens ?
[04:41:43] <TTomiK> do I have to put a complete url with #tab1 to the HREF ?
[05:26:20] <MPer> I got a strange problem, the .post call throws an error (WRONG_THIS_ERR) when building the params. I think it has to be the success handler function but it's so easy, just an if with two alerts ("success", "no success").
[05:33:35] <DieguezZ> hi, i got some pages pointing to another that has a form. How can i get in the form the url they came from?
[05:35:02] <Cork> DieguezZ: the page you point to could grab the referer header from the first pages request and add it to the form
[05:35:15] <Cork> DieguezZ: if you don't control the second page; you can't
[05:35:35] <DieguezZ> [Cork] both pages are part of my website
[05:35:57] <Cork> DieguezZ: then use the referer header
[05:36:47] <DieguezZ> somethinig like value="<?php echo "http://". $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']; ?>" inside a hidden field cork?
[05:37:19] <Cork> DieguezZ: yes, though you shouild make sure to escape that
[05:37:29] <Cork> else you could get xss
[05:37:54] <DieguezZ> ty Cork :)
[05:49:04] <logix812> Unit testing touchevents. I Assume if I am testing a swipe or something I would trigger start and then send a series of moves followed by an end?
[05:49:40] <slax0r> does .data() setting mangle with the value? like urlencode?
[05:50:33] <Cork> slax0r: no .data() just stores the data in a javascript object
[06:05:27] <clime> hey I have got a strange problem with pjax (but I guess it's not specific to pjax only). When I load a page, made an ajax request request there, navigate to next page, and then click on back button, the ajax response is displayed which is just tiny html snippet. How to prevent this?
[06:07:30] <reloadz> hi! i use json the send back data nd it returns string "#namelv, #nameru, #nameen", i understand that i cant use this string as selectro... is there and way i can convert it as selector?
[06:08:07] <Cork> reloadz: you can use it as a selector
[06:08:40] <Cork> reloadz: what is the variable for the selector?
[06:08:49] <Cork> (or key if you prefer)
[06:09:41] <reloadz> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/B4c7v/
[06:10:15] <Cork> reloadz: first set your server to send a correct mimetype, and you won't need $.parseJSON
[06:10:43] <Cork> reloadz: and the selector should be obj.duplicate?
[06:14:10] <reloadz> Cork: yes! duplicate - witch input ID values duplicate in DB
[06:15:16] <Cork> reloadz: so have your server / script set Content-Type: application/json when it sends json
[06:15:32] <Cork> reloadz: that way the header will actually tell what data your sending and things will, work
[06:15:42] <Cork> for the selector
[06:15:58] <Cork> just $(obj.duplicate) should work
[06:21:19] <reloadz> Cork: changed header and toke out that line .... selector still not working :(
[06:21:20] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/B4c7v/1/
[06:21:56] <Cork> reloadz: what do you get in an console.log(data.duplicate) ?
[06:22:42] <reloadz> #namelv, #nameru, #nameen
[06:22:59] <Cork> and $('#namelv, #nameru, #nameen').length gives you 3 ?
[06:23:04] <Cork> (or at least > 0)
[06:23:51] <reloadz> 3
[06:24:02] <duckgoose> 4 5 6
[06:24:19] <duckgoose> I;m helping :0
[06:24:43] <reloadz> must say - fields are in dialog, but i thing it doesint care, because it still is counting .length
[06:25:09] <reloadz> so it must be selecting...
[06:25:14] <Cork> reloadz: what does $('[id="namelv"], [id="nameru"], [id="nameen"]').length give you?
[06:25:34] <ShaneHudson> I'm still getting undefined whenever I log a string in a plugin... that surely shouldn't happen
[06:26:12] <reloadz> 3 :D
[06:26:19] <Cork> ok so no duplicates
[06:26:38] <Cork> reloadz: and you ran the console line just above the .css() call line?
[06:27:00] <reloadz> yes
[06:27:12] <Cork> but the border doesn't change?
[06:27:49] <Cork> (have you checked so the css isn't added to the dom element? )
[06:28:01] <reloadz> css file
[06:28:39] <Cork> reloadz: no i meant check the element after the ajax call
[06:28:40] <reloadz> if I may pm you the link?
[06:28:50] <Cork> so style="border: ...." isn't set there
[06:28:56] <reloadz> no!
[06:29:08] <Cork> that makes no sense...
[06:29:21] <reloadz> can i send you the link?
[06:29:26] <reloadz> pm you the link!
[06:43:41] <MPer> is it possible to use a data- attribute as attribute for .sortable('toArray') ?
[06:44:03] <reloadz> Cork: OMG! I can't spell "border" right XD
[06:44:49] <MPer> it seems that I get the whole array of of sortables back instead of just the attribute.

[07:00:31] <Icehawk78> Hi, I'm trying to dynamically load a css file with jquery, and while I can see the file load in the console, the css styles contained within don't appear to be taking effect. Is there something more that I need to do than $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />').appendTo('head').attr('href','my_url');  ?
[07:04:02] <thrustcore> is there a datepicker with a time also?
[07:09:43] <ph88> do elements need to be placed in DOM before you can bind events ?
[07:11:20] <BillCriswell> ph88: No.
[07:12:04] <BillCriswell> var $div = $('<div/>').text('Hi'); $div.on('click', function(){ console.log('clicked'); }); $div.appendTo('body'); would be a nice quick test though.
[07:12:52] <ph88> oh i always thought that !
[07:13:26] <ph88> but for sure it has to become a html element first ... and not just a string of html
[07:16:45] <dAnjou> BillCriswell: for me $(".foo").on("click", function() {...}); didn't work when there wasn't already an element with that class present.
[07:17:16] <grafi> standard
[07:17:22] <dAnjou> i had to do $(document).on("click", ".foo", function(){});
[07:19:24] <BillCriswell> dAnjou: http://jsbin.com/uVOzuHI/1/edit seems to work fine
[07:22:13] <dAnjou> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/uVOzuHI/2/
[07:22:36] <dAnjou> http://jsbin.com/uVOzuHI/2/edit
[07:22:55] <BillCriswell> Of course that wouldn't work.
[07:23:19] <dAnjou> it worked with older jquery versions and .live()
[07:23:35] <dAnjou> but apparently that's deprecated and i should use .on() now
[07:23:54] <clime> to solve the problem with back button and ajax in chrome I needed to set Vary:Accept header on the ajax response
[07:24:35] <guy> I would expect inputReference.attr($.expando)
[07:24:44] <guy> to return unique element reference
[07:24:57] <guy> is there another property that jQuery uses/
[07:25:36] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help with jquery mobile ui. I'm trying to implement it here http://208.87.22.137:50000/about-residence but for some reason I can't scroll. Any ideas?
[07:41:03] <pi3r> Hi guys
[07:41:21] <pi3r> I'm looking for a way to access clipboard data but so far no luck ...
[07:41:48] <pi3r> zeroclipboard seems only capable of writing to the clipboard
[07:41:51] <pi3r> not reading
[07:42:58] <Ricaz> I have a loop, I want to add <li>s to an <ul>, but the <ul> already contains 2 <li>s; one has to be first and the other has to be last in the <ul>. How do I add in between?
[07:42:58] <codezombie> using chrome, I'm noticing that $.ajax with a POST type, and $.post do not send an OPTIONS request first. This causes a CORS issue, any reason this would not be sending the OPTIONS request first?
[07:43:47] <Ricaz> pi3r, have never worked with this before, but I could imagine grabbing clipboard data would cause a security issue?
[07:43:58] <Ricaz> I mean, if the client has copied a pw or something..
[07:49:36] <WebDragon> Ricaz: pop the last li off and store it, then append your li's and then reapply the stored one ?
[07:50:13] <NoiseEee> or use http://api.jquery.com/before/ http://api.jquery.com/after/
[07:50:43] <ph88> when i take the html() of a jQuery and try to put it in another one will i loose the bindings ?
[07:50:55] <WebDragon> s/loose/lose/ ?
[07:51:14] <ph88> lose
[07:51:47] <WebDragon> and I'm not sure I follow your question aright. have you tried this in jsfiddle?
[07:51:52] <ph88> no
[07:51:56] <NoiseEee> ph88: use clone(true) if you want the data/bindings to persist when you move nodes
[07:52:31] <ph88> how can i reference the original instead of clone ?
[07:52:45] <ph88> i need a bunch of jQuery objects to be in 1 object
[07:52:54] <WebDragon> store them in different vars ? :)
[07:53:05] <ph88> i have this http://pastebin.com/M4ewdzBk
[07:53:28] <ph88> o.html()  <-- i loose stuff here i think
[07:53:53] <WebDragon> s/loose/lose/ =P
[07:54:17] <WebDragon> (the singularly most annoying typomeme I've ever encountered in my lifetime)
[07:54:36] <WebDragon> loose = not tight
[07:54:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hello, When I use append("tr"), it also closes the tag automatically
[07:55:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> append("<tr>") i mean
[07:55:18] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: yep
[07:55:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I just want to append "<tr>" literally
[07:55:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> because the tds are generated in there
[07:55:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and at the end I append "</tr>" - any way?
[07:55:55] <WebDragon> select the tr after you append it
[07:56:02] <WebDragon> then append to it
[07:56:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> That's not ideal in my case :(
[07:56:17] <WebDragon> thus avoiding the problem entirely
[07:56:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can't it be done otherwise?
[07:56:30] <rdldew> WebDragon: My biggest pet peeve is something that 90% of Americans say and don't even realize it's incorrect. They use 'is' instead of 'are' in certain sentences. Example: There's a lot of variables in this block.
[07:56:35] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: what possible problem could there be?
[07:56:42] <rdldew> It should be 'There are a lot of variables in this block.
[07:56:47] <WebDragon> rdldew: ooo good one
[07:56:57] <rdldew> I hhaaatttteee that so much.
[07:57:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> NoiseEee, because I have many manual rows, then I need to select them each
[07:57:20] <WebDragon> ecky--ptang-zoob: or generate the tds first and then wrap() them with a tr and append that
[07:57:20] <NoiseEee> ph88: don't use o.html(), create jquery objects/elements and append them
[07:57:28] <WebDragon> you just need to adjust your logic flow
[07:57:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, say I have all tds in 1 string
[07:57:51] <rdldew> Ok, so now onto my conundrum...
[07:58:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how would I do that to append the tr with that string inside it?
[07:58:18] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: var newTR = $('<tr>').html(someStringOfTDsAndContent);
[07:58:20] <WebDragon> $mytdsallappendedtogether.wrap('<tr>')
[07:58:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, that would do it, thx
[07:58:46] <rdldew> I have something called defaultOptions.removeButton that refers to a class that the user will put on a remove button (obviously).
[07:58:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $('<tr>') would also create the tr?
[07:59:10] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes
[07:59:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> or do I need to append the newTR?
[07:59:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> to the tbody?
[07:59:25] <WebDragon> you do that afterwards
[07:59:29] <rdldew> The remove button will remove the last duplicated item, or itself (if it is the duplicated item), or the parent of itself (if that parent is the duplicated item).
[07:59:51] <NoiseEee> well, you'd then either append that <tr> to the body or add to the chain... .appendTo(theTableBodyReference)
[08:00:00] <WebDragon> "Don't press it! it's the history eraser button you fool!"
[08:00:03] <rdldew> Right now, I can create several items and make the user specify different classes, but I'd rather use a single thing to have clicked.
[08:00:05] <ph88> NoiseEee:  i have this now  http://pastebin.com/Spxx1YjR   but the <div class="content"> is closed to soon and my /div at line 13 is ignored
[08:00:20] <NoiseEee> ph88: review the comments we just made to ecky--ptang-zoob
[08:00:32] <rdldew> I'm trying to figure out how I could check if the removeButton is in the duplicated item or outside of the duplicated item and change what happens.
[08:00:39] <rdldew> Any ideas of a way to check that?
[08:01:01] <WebDragon> some form of parent()  or what is it.. nearest? closest? I forget. but it's in the jquery api somewhere
[08:01:18] <rdldew> Yeah, I was thinking of closest() too.
[08:02:26] <thrustcore> when I draw a Google Charts chart, how do I control 'hAxis.gridlines.count'? I tried adding 'hAxis.gridlines.count': 10 to my options: { } but the chart is not drawn with 10 grid lines
[08:04:26] <ph88> i try with wrap but it's not good http://pastebin.com/2WhfPqz3
[08:04:39] <Brodingo> thrustcore jquery?

[08:05:49] <WebDragon> ph88: jsfiddle > pastebin
[08:05:51] <thrustcore> Brodingo: I asked javascript and they didn't even acknowledge the question
[08:09:00] <ph88> WebDragon:  jsfiddle works http://jsfiddle.net/TqBzy/
[08:09:03] <Brodingo> thrustcore could post on the google forums
[08:10:18] <WebDragon> ph88: 'works' in the sense of what? I see no change in the resultant html pane
[08:11:24] <ph88> oh i see it's wrapped $el .. that's not suppose to happen .. only the contents of $el need to be wrapped
[08:13:04] <ph88> now i have this   http://pastebin.com/siVECg0M    but then o is not being wrapped ..
[08:16:38] <ph88> yey ! now it works, i found a nice function wrapInner :D
[08:21:07] <ph88> can i make this trigger the change event ?    .prop('checked', true);
[08:21:17] <ph88> for a checkbox
[08:21:52] <thrustcore> Brodingo: it was good advice you gave me, stumbled upon a thread where it's stated that this is an issue that is still `accepted', not resolved yet. Darn it.
[08:22:07] <anew> return false(); 'boolean is not a function'
[08:22:46] <dAnjou> that seems true
[08:22:48] <NoiseEee> ph88: if you want to trigger, use trigger().
[08:22:52] <dAnjou> *BADUMMTSS*
[08:22:58] <dAnjou> i'll show myself out
[08:23:27] <anew> i am getting this from an opensource script
[08:23:30] <anew> i wonder why they did that ?
[08:23:46] <dAnjou> because people make mistakes?
[08:24:34] <anew> not these people ohhhhh not these people
[08:24:36] <Brodingo> thrustcore at least its got attention, best of luck
[08:30:24] <tgodar>  $("select[^id='auctionSeller-seller']")  is that not valid?
[08:31:49] <NoiseEee> tgodar: ^ is for the value, not the attribute
[08:32:25] <tgodar> doh, thanks, was starting at it for too long
[08:34:26] <tgodar> there a better way to match an array of elements with names like foo[1], foo [2]?,
[08:35:20] <tgodar> than sub string matching of the id part like I am now
[08:42:35] <gnarf> tgodar also add a .foo class to them?
[08:43:45] <AlexanderBB10> London, UK  AWESOME -> http://cdn.n4bb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Victoria-London-620x400.jpg
[08:43:47] <tgodar> yeah, I should probably just do that... kinda F'ed up approach to decorators though where its a PITA to append a class, but thats another story
[08:44:31] <WebDragon> something in jsfiddle is preventing 1.10.1 and 2.0.2 from working for me, but 2.x (edge) and 1.9.1 both work fine on the same scripting
[08:46:34] <BillCriswell> WebDragon: Doesn't sound very fun.
[08:47:10] <WebDragon> indeed, had me scratching my head a bit
[08:49:09] <gnu_d> Hi, I don't understand here anything, guess I'm retarded or something: jQuery.each(this.members, function(index, member) {}, fails saying: "second argument to Function.prototype.apply must be an array", but the second argument is an Array, to test that I tried to push a value, it worked, I tried looping it with for ... in, it worked, I even tried to make a demo sandbox, it worked also, the last thing I tried is Object.prototype.toString.call(this.members), that 
[08:51:37] <gnu_d> the this.members is defined as this.members = [], if this isn't an array I'll commit suicide.
[08:54:33] <diphtherial> hey, i'm writing a small jquery plugin for my own use that renders a calendar "heatmap"
[08:55:02] <diphtherial> i have the part working where it takes a selector and injects a calendar into it, but what's the best way to add methods that can be called on this calendar later on?
[08:55:28] <diphtherial> e.g. $("#cal").viscal(); is working, but i'd later like to do $("#cal").update()
[08:58:09] <rdldew> This logic seems correct, but I don't understand why it's not
[08:58:09] <rdldew> http://jsfiddle.net/aVRun/4/
[08:58:32] <rdldew> Wait
[08:58:35] <rdldew> Maybe it is
[08:58:46] <gnu_d> How come this https://gist.github.com/gnud/a0bd864c0aa2e0df1475 works, but doesn't work inside another $.each loop, the same code.
[08:58:56] <rdldew> Nope, it's not. Dang.
[08:59:23] <kaldrenon> If I change the content of an element with $(thing).html(), can I animate the resize if it changes the dimensions of the parent?
[09:00:04] <kaldrenon> Alternatively, if I use $(thing).animate(), can I change the thing's html during that?
[09:00:49] <gnu_d> does anybody reads my questions?
[09:01:00] <diphtherial> gnu_d: it'd probably be more useful to show us the broken code instead of the working code
[09:01:00] <rdldew> People do. Some people don't know how to respond.
[09:01:16] <rdldew> I concur with diphtherial on that too
[09:01:19] <diphtherial> right, i'm actually reading over rdldew's code now and thinking about kaldrenon's problem as well...
[09:01:29] <diphtherial> (to let you know why no one's responded yet, heh)
[09:01:45] <rdldew> I just don't know enough to be able to answer questions yet. lol
[09:02:07] <rdldew> If I change my fiddle to this diphtherial http://jsfiddle.net/aVRun/6/
[09:02:12] <rdldew> It still doesn't work correctly
[09:02:50] <maxmoore14> anyone know if it is possible to have a JQM popup in a separate file to be used by multiple pages?
[09:03:05] <rdldew> No idea, sorry.
[09:03:05] <maxmoore14> can't find anything in the docs on it
[09:03:15] <rdldew> Have you tried it yet?
[09:03:16] <diphtherial> rdldew: it may be that your empty selection is evaluating to true
[09:03:21] <diphtherial> you should probably check that its length is > 0
[09:03:34] <gnu_d> diphtherial: here is the full code: https://gist.github.com/gnud/954931dc36c3918b95ec
[09:03:40] <diphtherial> e.g. $(".removeButton").parent(".divClass").length > 0 or somesuch
[09:03:56] <maxmoore14> found a bunch of similar questions searching around, but no answers
[09:04:00] <rdldew> Ah
[09:04:24] <diphtherial> rdldew: heh, in fact, yeah, that's the problem :) if ([]) { console.log("true!"); } prints "true!"
[09:04:53] <rdldew> Well, using length() might make it work. However, in the end it won't get to the solution I need.
[09:04:53] <diphtherial> js has some funny equivalence rules; there are multiple versions of the == operator, for instance, like ===
[09:04:56] <rdldew> Dang
[09:05:02] <rdldew> Yeah
[09:05:02] <diphtherial> rdldew: why is that?
[09:05:18] <rdldew> Well, see, I'm trying to have a single defaultOption.removeButton to be used.
[09:05:42] <diphtherial> gnu_d: why not use the $ instead of the jQuery alias in that inner each loop, out of curiosity?
[09:06:01] <noiredeb> hi
[09:06:05] <gnu_d> diphtherial: I thought that's the problem
[09:06:22] <gnu_d> diphtherial: so I changed it to JQuery.each
[09:06:23] <rdldew> The user will run my plugin, click a button which will duplicate a node. If the remove button is inside the duplicated node, I want it to remove the duplicated node and itself. If the remove button is outside of the duplicated node, I want it to remove the last duplicated item.
[09:06:27] <rdldew> Does that make sense?
[09:06:47] <gnu_d> diphtherial: I really don't understand
[09:06:56] <diphtherial> gnu_d: my intuition is that groups is empty, so your inner loop is never executing
[09:07:03] <diphtherial> gnu_d: it's hard to say without more information, though
[09:07:18] <gnu_d> diphtherial: how come I get this error then: TypeError: second argument to Function.prototype.apply must be an array
[09:07:48] <diphtherial> gnu_d: good question, heh; let me try out your code for a minute
[09:08:02] <diphtherial> (i'm kind of a jquery newbie myself; i have to look these things up, unfortunately)
[09:08:29] <rdldew> gnu_d: See if this helps. http://forums.greensock.com/topic/4049-help-with-error-1116-second-argument-to-functionprototype/
[09:09:25] <diphtherial> gnu_d: what is the type of 'groups'?
[09:09:37] <gnu_d> diphtherial: same, it's an array
[09:10:05] <diphtherial> gnu_d: you can't use .each() on that, then; you'd have to say $.each(groups, function() { ... })
[09:10:23] <diphtherial> that variant of .each that you're trying to use exists only with a selection of DOM elements
[09:10:41] <diphtherial> whereas the $.each() version will work with any iterable
[09:11:02] <gnu_d> diphtherial: but why it gets inside the loop then ?
[09:11:16] <gnu_d> diphtherial: but not in the second loop
[09:11:31] <diphtherial> hmm, let me test it out, one second
[09:11:36] <diphtherial> so groups is an array of what?
[09:12:36] <gnu_d> diphtherial: well, Strings I guess
[09:12:56] <diphtherial> huh, and strange, i take back what i said about $(groups).each() not working -- it actually does
[09:13:04] <diphtherial> http://jsfiddle.net/wqdmq/
[09:13:32] <diphtherial> or better yet: http://jsfiddle.net/wqdmq/1/
[09:14:19] <diphtherial> rdldew: what do you mean by 'node'? do you mean an arbitrary DOM element, like a div?
[09:14:37] <rdldew> Yeah. I'll show you a working example of what I've done so far.
[09:15:56] <gnu_d> diphtherial: you were right about the groups each function, but I still don't get it :D why it entered inside :D.
[09:16:04] <rdldew> http://demo.myradicalsolutions.com/duplicator/
[09:16:20] <rdldew> Ok, so click the first button on the right three times.
[09:16:31] <rdldew> You will have three new blue boxes on the left.
[09:16:52] <rdldew> No matter which Remove button you click, it will remove the last duplicated item.
[09:17:07] <tgodar> http://jsfiddle.net/uTDKj/2/ not sure my brain is working this morning, why can't i seem to write a next() selection that works?
[09:17:10] <diphtherial> i see; you just want it to remove its parent, i'm guessing?
[09:17:34] <rdldew> I would like to be able to click a Remove button that was just made and remove itself. But, if you click the remove last duplicate button on the right, to remove the last duplicate.
[09:17:36] <rdldew> Yeah, but…
[09:17:40] <rdldew> here's the catch
[09:18:16] <rdldew> I don't want separate classes specified. I'd like to make it a little more "intelligent" and detect which .removeDuplicateBtn was clicked and do the action like that.
[09:18:29] <rdldew> It will make it so the user will only need to specify one class for the remove button.
[09:18:51] <diphtherial> right, you don't have to; use a relative reference in your removeButton's click handler, e.g. this: $('.removeButton').click(function() { $(this).parent('.divClass').remove(); });
[09:19:25] <rdldew> Well that will work, but it will remove the parent of any remove button that was clicked.
[09:19:43] <starsinmypockets> How do I get the cursor into a text input? I'm trying $('#elem').focus() no love
[09:19:58] <diphtherial> rdldew: isn't that what you want, to remove the parent of the removeButton that was clicked?
[09:20:03] <rdldew> What are you trying to do starsinmypockets ?
[09:20:45] <maxmoore14> anyone know if it is possible to have a JQM popup in a separate file to be used by multiple pages? It looks like maybe this is a new feature coming in 1.4. Can anyone confirm?
[09:20:51] <starsinmypockets> Using backbone to load a multistep form - I want the cursor to be in a text input when the page is rendered
[09:20:52] <rdldew> diphtherial: These three use cases: http://pastebin.com/sDjddQJQ
[09:21:20] <rdldew> Hm, a bit too much for my feeble mind. lol
[09:21:27] <diphtherial> tgodar: the syntax for selecting input elements with the type attribute set to text would be "input[type=text]"
[09:22:31] <tgodar> diphtherial: just to make sure we understand each other that's a class I am trying to match with now...
[09:22:32] <starsinmypockets> rdldew - I just need to use jquery to put the cursor in a text input
[09:22:53] <diphtherial> starsinmypockets: $("#textbox").focus() should do the trick
[09:23:11] <starsinmypockets> yeah no love dunno - maybe a browser thing
[09:23:15] <rdldew> I was going to say the same thing.
[09:23:18] <tgodar> diphtherial: am I being dense?  Does next not traverse the DOM in that way?  do i need to go up a level then look?
[09:23:29] <rdldew> starsinmypockets: Load an example of your code into jsfiddle and share that.
[09:24:45] <diphtherial> tgodar: ah, apologies...let me look over your code again
[09:24:50] <diphtherial> seems that it's early for me too, heh
[09:25:40] <tgodar> yeah, maybe i need more coffee,  Feel silly, every simple thing I try today doesn't work , ty
[09:26:40] <diphtherial> tgodar: as for next(), i think it only traverses the immediate siblings
[09:26:50] <diphtherial> your <select> tag has no siblings, since it's inside a div on its own
[09:27:42] <tgodar> find maybe make more sense?  naw, suppose ill use some string manipulation and just search with #foo - thanks - jsut wanted to be sure I wasn't just making a typo or something
[09:28:18] <diphtherial> i agree that next() is tricky; better to search from the top or at least from the nearest common ancestor using find() imo
[09:29:07] <diphtherial> rdldew: this is just an idea, but perhaps you can tag duplicated elements somehow, perhaps with the data() method
[09:29:41] <diphtherial> then the task would be, given some removeButton, to first check itself and then all of its ancestors for that duplicated flag, and to remove the first element it finds
[09:29:57] <diphtherial> if that fails, then get the set of duplicated elements in the document and remove the last one
[09:30:06] <diphtherial> (again using the duplicated flag)
[09:30:20] <rdldew> Well, they technically get incremented IDs. Those IDs are usually pretty specific. They are usually 1 of 3 different IDs with an incremented value.
[09:30:46] <rdldew> That's a good idea though. I'll check out that method.
[09:31:11] <diphtherial> the format of the id is one way to 'tag' it, i suppose, although it strikes me as being kind of fragile
[09:31:23] <diphtherial> (you might for instance end up with elements that coincidentally have the same format)
[09:31:58] <diphtherial> fwiw, you can also search through data associated with elements using a selector, although the syntax eludes me right now
[09:33:17] <rdldew> I'll keep that in mind while I continue working out this crazy logic. lol
[09:33:46] <diphtherial> heh, yeah, it does seem a bit odd, honestly :)
[09:34:02] <diphtherial> i'm sure it makes sense in context
[09:34:09] <rdldew> It's what the 'boss' wants. lol
[09:34:27] <rdldew> I was ok with making the user of the plugin specify separate IDs for the remove buttons.
[09:39:00] <diphtherial> i happen to agree that it's better not to have that requirement, but working now is better than perfect never...
[09:40:27] <rdldew> Yup
[09:41:52] <platzhirsch> Would it work if I make an AJAX call in a method and return inside the response function the response itself, would the value to to the method caller?
[09:43:02] <noiredeb> do you know how can I activate a banner (script banner) inside a jquery code?
[09:43:05] <diphtherial> platzhirsch: no, the callback runs long after the original call has returned
[09:43:14] <diphtherial> (well, not necessarily 'long' after, but definitely not in the same scope)
[09:43:24] <platzhirsch> yes, get that.. damn
[09:43:37] <diphtherial> platzhirsch: i think there's a blocking flag to the ajax calls that causes the caller to wait
[09:43:53] <diphtherial> but that'll hang up the page, too, since javascript is single-threaded
[09:44:18] <diphtherial> why not allow the caller to specify their own callback, that you invoke from the ajax callback?
[09:44:51] <diphtherial> i realize it sounds kind of wacky, but it'd work, i think
[09:45:27] <platzhirsch> diphtherial: mh, not necessarily, I like the idea, I will take a look if it's applicable :)
[09:52:47] <anew> http://board.cubettech.com/demo/ can anyone hel me here, i cant see the js that triggers the add pin on the top
[09:55:24] <crash1hd> why does this not return me an array of heights? .makeArray( $('.pollHeading').css('height') )
[09:55:50] <_rgn> crash1hd: because that doesn't do what you think it does
[09:56:17] <_rgn> can't do something like $('.foo').css('height') and expect it to return an array
[09:56:31] <_rgn> always returns a value for just one element
[09:56:43] <crash1hd> righrt
[09:56:54] <crash1hd> so is there an easy way without using .each?
[09:56:55] <_rgn> you need to use map()
[09:57:04] <crash1hd> ok :) thanks
[09:57:58] <_rgn> $('.foo').map(function() { return $(this).css('height') });
[09:58:51] <_rgn> [1, 2, 3].map(function(n) { return n + 1; }); // => [2, 3, 4]
[09:59:49] <crash1hd> right :) thanks
[10:03:39] <HenryCH> Why does this change the shape of the input boxes and text? http://jsfiddle.net/vfMvf/1/
[10:03:46] <HenryCH> makes them a tiny bit smaller
[10:04:10] <HenryCH> I want them to stay exactly as they were, tried border and shadow  none doesn't help
[10:04:53] <_rgn> because you're changing the defaults
[10:05:38] <_rgn> doesn't change the shape? http://jsfiddle.net/vfMvf/2/
[10:09:02] <platzhirsch> I want to build a status loop, which continues to call itself until all jobs are finished, but I fear with this implementation it won't repeat the AJAX request, will it? https://gist.github.com/platzhirsch/964d0b609d4e7575793f
[10:12:59] <platzhirsch> oh, I swapped the arguments of setTimeout
[10:13:00] <platzhirsch> hit me
[10:22:33] <maxmoore14> anyone know if it is possible to have a JQM popup in a separate file to be used by multiple pages? It looks like maybe this is a new feature coming in 1.4. Can anyone confirm?
[10:28:31] <HenryCH> Thanks _rgn, that's strange, I could swear it was shrinking the text without the border and shadow lines :P , guess I messed something up
[10:29:32] <kaldrenon> Asked this a bit ago, don't know if anyone thought of an answer: If I change the content of an element with $(thing).html(), can I animate the resize if it changes the dimensions of the parent?
[10:29:36] <kaldrenon> Alternatively, if I use $(thing).animate(), can I change the thing's html during that?
[10:29:48] <DieguezZ> hi, i am sending a form with jquery. My problem is that i am getting the placeholder when a field is empty instead of showing it as empty. any ides?
[10:31:48] <wild_oscar> I am displaying a table that needs horizontal scroll. but since the number of rows will be big, having to go way down to find the scroll bar is not handy
[10:31:54] <wild_oscar> what would you suggest?
[10:33:09] <kaldrenon> wild_oscar: put the whole thing inside a containing element, give that element a size constraint, and enable vertical scroll for the element?
[10:33:44] <kaldrenon> e.g. put the table in a div and turn on  overflow: scroll; for the div with CSS
[10:34:38] <wild_oscar> yes, that is an option. I am trying that, actually, as I need to see how it behaves in terms of responsiveness
[10:39:25] <fission6> i have an image and then two buttons under it, i am trying to use $(button).prev('img') but its not returning the image for some reason, they are sybings
[10:41:27] <fission6> $(b).siblings('img') works, $(b).prev('img') doesn't
[10:49:49] <DieguezZ> hi, i am using this to make placeholders work in ie-8 the problem is that when i sumbit that form i am getting the placeholder instead of an empty field. http://bpaste.net/show/Bv6Ed0Rows6bGuwbIeps/ any ideas on how to fix this?
[10:52:12] <Zzaichik> I bet line 20 isn't working properly.
[10:52:39] <Zzaichik> ..or the way you think it is, I should say.
[10:53:05] <shoky> fission6: it's probably not the immediate previous sibling, then
[10:53:13] <fission6> yea
[10:53:46] <DieguezZ> sure Zzaichik any ideas on how to fix it? :S
[10:53:51] <shoky> you can try .prevAll('img').first()
[10:54:07] <fission6> yea
[10:54:12] <fission6> hanks
[10:58:06] <Zzaichik> I lied, line 11 is probably where it's breaking - you're assigning the placeholder to the input value. I not sure I understand why any of that is necessary. give a generic placeholder, add remove the placeholder text based on interaction or existence of an actual value. They should be separate attributes.

[11:09:36] <anew> live is now on right ?
[11:10:29] <Zzaichik> kind of?
[11:10:33] <blindMoe> anew: basically
[11:12:43] <anew> can i safely just cut 'live' and copy paste 'live' into every instance
[11:12:53] <DieguezZ> [Zzaichik] i solved it in other way, i just load that ie8 fix if its ie8 xD
[11:17:25] <Zzaichik> DieguezZ: okay cool. I bet my ways better. ;p
[11:18:27] <DieguezZ> [Zzaichik] ill try it your way :D
[11:20:50] <Zzaichik> lol
[11:20:54] <Zzaichik> I'm just playing man
[11:21:06] <Zzaichik> I don't really care what you do. :) If it works, it works.
[11:21:57] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/1/edit -- anybody have a vague idea to replace the default jQuery Mobile loader with https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress/?
[11:25:58] <bricker> So I like to store class names in variables for reuse, but sometimes they need the "." and sometimes not. There has to be a better way to manage it than `var className = "some-class"; $("." + className).find ...`
[11:28:12] <bricker> $({ class: className }).find ..., or something
[11:35:27] <Mrgoose2> howdy , quick question on traversing http://pastie.org/8342380
[11:35:38] <Mrgoose2> ive tried  $(this).closest("li").children("a")
[11:35:39] <Mrgoose2> and nothing
[11:38:03] <NoiseEee> Mrgoose2: that should be fine, try on JS fiddle
[11:38:43] <NoiseEee> or $(this).closest('li').find('a')
[11:41:48] <Mrgoose2> find gives me 2 matches
[11:41:52] <Mrgoose2> but children gives me 0 matches
[11:54:51] <FuryFoo> Hi , I'm trying to replace the "2" in the "2n+1" below with the var "logoNumber" but don't really know how to do this
[11:54:52] <FuryFoo> $(".logos img:nth-of-type(2n+1)").css("margin-left" , ((articleWidth - logoImgWidth*logoNumber - 10*logoNumber)/logoNumber));
[11:54:52] <FuryFoo> Any ideas please ?
[11:56:28] <platzhirsch> If I want to create an element through $("<div>"), is it possible to provide the content of the div in another argument or must it become part of the string? $("<div>yolo</div>")
[11:57:16] <BillCriswell> FuryFoo: You mean in the selector?
[11:57:32] <FuryFoo> @Bill : Yes
[11:58:21] <FuryFoo> I'm thing to make the selector a bit dynamic . I'm thinking to compose the selector in a var but not sure if that's possibile
[11:58:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you read a json file with jquery, is it possible to save it in a variable, makes changes inside the json and save the result to a different json file?
[11:58:54] <BillCriswell> FuryFoo: You could do $('.logos img:nth-of-type(' + logoNumber + ')');
[12:00:14] <FuryFoo> @Bill : Yep that works - seems that it was simpler than I though.
[12:00:17] <FuryFoo> Thanks man
[12:00:19] <BillCriswell> FuryFoo: Do you only want to select a specific child? What you're doing seems weird.
[12:00:32] <BillCriswell> You want the odd elements from that position?
[12:01:11] <FuryFoo> The var logoNumber does goes from 1 to 4+  and the selector choses the n+1 , 2n+1 and so on
[12:01:42] <FuryFoo> It's for some responsive design so logoNumber is calculated
[12:02:33] <BillCriswell> FuryFoo: Are you trying to select one element or a group of them?
[12:03:35] <FuryFoo> I'm selecting a group of elements : every second , every third and so on
[12:03:47] <BillCriswell> Oh ok just making sure.
[12:05:08] <FuryFoo> No problem - I already implemented the code a few mins ago and it works just fine
[12:05:57] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[12:14:54] <JFranks> Hmmm how would I make: http://jsbin.com/URiSeFi/1/edit?html,js,output smoother? Like add an effect?
[12:15:52] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!!
[12:16:14] <Bloomberg> <a class='left-menu-a' onClick="newtagleft('options')" data-idev='<?php echo $row['idEvento']?>' data-info='<?php echo $row['nombreEvento'];?>'><?php echo $row['nombreEvento'];?></a>
[12:16:54] <Bloomberg> If I'm doing some like this, how can I in the newtagleft function get the properties of tag?
[12:17:56] <JFranks> Bloomberg: http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:18:40] <Bloomberg> bu will be some like this  ::  $(this).attr('id') for example
[12:20:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you have a page on which only headers are present and all html values are set via jquery, is there a way to press a button and reload the page without any values added?
[12:20:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> reset it or something
[12:21:50] <JFranks> ecky: You mean reload the base URL without keeping the current page data?
[12:22:06] <ph88> doesn't F5 do that ?
[12:22:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes, remove all stuff that was added dynamically with jquery
[12:22:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes, but I want it reset without a page reloda
[12:22:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> reload
[12:22:33] <ph88> why ?
[12:22:36] <JFranks> window.location = "http://mysite.com/mypage.html";
[12:22:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that will reload :(
[12:23:08] <ph88> what's the use case ?
[12:23:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a html page with only table headers and now rows... the rows are added via jquery
[12:23:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no row*
[12:24:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then the user can edit the values in the row
[12:24:16] <JFranks> Right.. so the page data only exists in the client browsers.
[12:24:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and when he does and presses cancel, all original values should be restored
[12:24:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[12:24:35] <ph88> :P
[12:24:52] <ph88> then you save the original values in a variable
[12:25:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah but it's a lot
[12:25:28] <ph88> you only save it when he starts to edit
[12:25:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but then it would be inside the scope of the edit click handler
[12:25:58] <ph88> then when the user cancel you replace the value again and clear the memory
[12:26:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and the cancel button is a different handler
[12:26:04] <ph88> it would be max 1 value at one time
[12:26:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the edit button puts the whole page in edit mode
[12:26:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and all values are saved or cancelled at once
[12:26:31] <ph88> different handlers can read the same variable if you set it up right
[12:26:48] <ph88> that's bad design if you ask me ^^
[12:27:11] <ph88> why would you save a value that has not been updated ??
[12:27:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes, I proposed it different... but they want to do only 1 server call on save
[12:27:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> send 1 big json
[12:27:38] <JFranks> I've never tackled 'undo' .. always left that to the browser to tackle.. Especially with plugins like Lazarus that save input field data history to client side cookies..
[12:27:44] <ph88> but why save it again when it's not updated ?
[12:27:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ??
[12:28:16] <JFranks> Do a google search for 'Lazarus plugin' .. you'll find it..
[12:28:29] <JFranks> That will give each input an 'undo' history..
[12:28:29] <ph88> user has A B C D  ... he change B into F  ->  A F C D    and you send back to the server A F C D  ? instead of just the only updated value B  --> F   ?
[12:28:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes
[12:28:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It's not my idea
[12:28:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> they want to send everything, also the not updated stuff
[12:29:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but that's not the issue here :p
[12:29:13] <ph88> this is bad design and now adding more bad programming to work with the previous bad programming -___-
[12:29:34] <JFranks> ph88 has a point.. good design solves these challenges for you. ;)
[12:29:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but I didn't make the design :-|
[12:30:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i'm just workign on someone's stuff
[12:30:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> with that as the task
[12:30:18] <ph88> so afaik ... the browser reads the original HTML then makes DOM out of it ... javascript has access to DOM ... but now you want access to the original HTML
[12:30:24] <ph88> in fact what you want is a shadow DOM
[12:30:31] <ph88> otherwise you will have to parse all that text again
[12:30:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shadow dom, yes yes, that sounds good
[12:30:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :)
[12:31:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you think that will use too much memory?
[12:31:06] <ph88> so what about  var old_body = $('body').clone();
[12:31:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> save the whole dom in a var?
[12:31:14] <ph88> i think this is very very bad
[12:31:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> me too
[12:31:35] <ph88> put that line first before any other scripts
[12:31:43] <ph88> i mean after you load jQuery of course
[12:31:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok let me try
[12:32:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and then just $('body').html(old_body); ?
[12:32:50] <ph88> eh
[12:33:03] <ph88> if he cancel 1 action you want to restore the entire page ?
[12:33:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> there is only 1 cancel button, that cancels everything
[12:33:22] <ph88> i'm not even sure if your event handlers stay bind if you do that ... probably not
[12:33:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok then I just do a page reload :-|
[12:33:53] <ph88> o_O
[12:33:55] <ph88> are you doing this professionally ??
[12:34:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm making it the way they asked me too
[12:34:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'd totally do it different
[12:34:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if it was for myself
[12:35:10] <ph88> did you know that html was originally designed so that you could edit pages ?
[12:35:14] <ph88> i think it's called webdav now
[12:40:17] <bmercer> I'm sure there are examples of this, but my google-fu is weak... how do I write jquery that matches a single <tr> click for an ajax call?
[12:40:50] <bmercer> I'm sure it involves getting href="/thing/" and "this" but I cannot make it work together
[12:40:50] <_rgn> your question is vague
[12:42:29] <bmercer> I've got a table and I want to run in an ajax call on click
[12:42:48] <bmercer> but I don't want to write an onclick per row, just want to throw it in a single location
[12:43:28] <bmercer> so document ready, find what row was clicked, pass an id into the call, update the row after that row with the result from that query...
[12:43:37] <bmercer> code to follow
[12:44:13] <_rgn> yeah well don't use onclick
[12:44:18] <_rgn> (the html attribute)
[12:44:50] <bmercer> http://pastie.org/8342530
[12:44:58] <ph88> jsfiddle
[12:45:24] <bmercer> that table body is generated from an ajax call
[12:45:39] <bmercer> and I'm using bootstrap 2.x
[12:45:59] <ph88> looks like there is no table body
[12:46:00] <_rgn> 1. figure out a good selector for the rows, something like .row, 2. get the unique id for that row, whatever that is in your case, 3. do the ajax call, 4. use response
[12:46:16] <bmercer> whoops, that's a mistake :)
[12:46:50] <bmercer> _rgn: exactly... but my query isn't solid enough to figure that out, that's the thing I've not been able to make work :)
[12:46:53] <bmercer> *jquery
[12:47:31] <_rgn> one step at a time
[12:48:38] <bmercer> ok, so I need to first match the on("click"...) to the proper .row
[12:48:51] <bmercer> lets try that
[12:51:15] <Ziber> I have two events on a textbox, a blur and a keyPress. If one of the events is triggered, I want to cancel the other one. How would I be able to do this?
[12:51:38] <bmercer> event.disableDefault();
[12:51:41] <ph88> stop()
[12:51:44] <ph88> hammer time !
[12:52:13] <_rgn> bmercer: $('.row') returns all the elements that match the selector, so when you do $('.row').on(ev, fn) you're binding an event on those elements
[12:52:51] <Ziber> stop() doesn't even let one of them trigger.
[12:54:06] <ph88> Ziber: depends when and where you call stop()
[12:54:26] <bmercer> _rgn: Yes, though I'm starting to wonder if my data-toggle is interfering with that some how
[12:54:46] <ph88> bmercer: http://pastebin.com/FKE4EE2Q ??
[12:54:57] * ph88 bored
[12:55:01] <Ziber> ph88: at the end of each of them?
[12:56:04] <joksy> helloka...
[12:56:05] <bmercer> ph88: I think that's right... in fact I had something similar to that
[12:56:12] <bmercer> but it looks like data-toggle is intercepting the click
[12:56:15] <ph88> Ziber: no lol :P
[12:56:20] <bmercer> do you see that in my tr?
[12:56:38] <Ziber> ph88: Okay, where?
[12:56:41] <ph88> Ziber: at the start of your trigger you put the stop() before start running the other action
[12:57:13] <Ziber> ph88: hm?
[12:57:20] <ph88> bmercer: data-toggle is one of the html data-* attributes which don't have any function other then ... storing data !
[12:57:42] <joksy> hello.. =B)
[12:57:56] <ph88> Ziber: event keypress and event blur (is that even an event ?)
[12:58:38] <bmercer> ph88: ok, I'm not too familiar with them :)
[12:58:41] <Ziber> also, sort of a side-issue. They're both .on() binds, but I have them separately written (as in anonymous functions), within each .on(). Can I use the function parameter to replace $(this) so I only have to write the function once?
[12:58:41] * bmercer tries stuff
[13:00:02] <bmercer> it appears I was b0rk1n my js
[13:00:53] <bmercer> http://pastie.org/8342567 # this doesn't work... what am I missing?
[13:00:55] <bmercer> a comma???
[13:01:01] <bmercer> I always miss some mundane detail!
[13:01:10] <bmercer> (can you tell it's almost time to go home on a friday?)
[13:01:57] <_rgn> if you're missing a comma there will be a syntax error which will be shown in the console
[13:02:11] <Ziber> got stop() to work. :D
[13:02:12] <_rgn> so no need to guess where it might be
[13:02:31] <bmercer> DOH!
[13:02:34] <bmercer> found it
[13:04:57] <Mrgoose2> how do you oganize your jquery mobile projects? Do you have a seperate file for each $(document).on('pageshow',#pageid  or do you place them all in one file?
[13:08:13] <rdldew> It seems like it would be better to have separate files and use them as you would need.
[13:08:44] <rdldew> That way you're not relying on the browser to load the potentially very large file with all of the jQuery in it.
[13:09:26] <blindMoe> Mrgoose2: for things like phonegap projects I combine them in to one but during devel I keep them separate
[13:09:54] <Mrgoose2> blindMoe: i see, what about organizing of functions
[13:09:59] <Mrgoose2> that may be used by different pages
[13:10:08] <Mrgoose2> global functions rather
[13:10:10] <blindMoe> global include fine
[13:10:17] <blindMoe> stick themm all in one file and include it
[13:10:43] <blindMoe> your live site should only be including one combined js file to cut down on calls to the server
[13:12:17] <Mrgoose2> thanks
[13:13:45] <eTiger13> Mrgoose2: ideally you dont have global function. you have modules and dependency injection
[13:14:04] <Mrgoose2> not sure what that means, do you have any links that describe that?
[13:15:18] <bmercer> whew, another crisis averted :)
[13:15:38] <bmercer> they don't like this old timer play in the UI too often, but when I do I make sure to whore the joint up!
[13:18:00] <rdldew> What would you do if you had a counter variable that was being incremented and decremented, but you didn't want to get duplicate variables? e.g. counter variable is incremented on a click and then appended to an ID, decremented when the element with that ID is removed, incremented on a new click and such
[13:18:44] <eTiger13> rdldew: not have a counter and instead have an array
[13:19:18] <eTiger13> Mrgoose2: requireJS
[13:19:18] <rdldew> I was thinking that too. :/
[13:19:32] <rdldew> I just didn't want to have to do that. Oh well
[13:21:22] <hye> hi
[13:22:05] <hye> I have function A that does an ajax request. In function B, I call function A several times.  How can I show a message once all of those ajax requests have completed successfully?
[13:22:37] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ @ hye
[13:23:08] <Bloomberg> How can I pass properties like data-something=' ' with onlick event?
[13:23:31] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: you use event listeners, not inline JS
[13:23:35] <anew> shouldnt on = live in jq
[13:23:37] <eTiger13> Bloomberg: onclick? or on("click"
[13:23:44] <anew> can i not delete 'live' and replace it with 'on' ?
[13:23:47] <anew> doesnt seem to be working
[13:23:56] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: and the handler function can grab the data-whatever
[13:23:58] <Bloomberg> <a class='left-menu-a' onClick="newtagleft('options')" data-idev='<?php echo $row['idEvento']?>' data-info='<?php echo $row['nombreEvento'];?>'><?php echo $row['nombreEvento'];?></a>
[13:24:00] <Bloomberg> For example
[13:24:07] <NoiseEee> anew: requires a touch of a syntax chang
[13:24:13] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: don't use inline JS!
[13:24:21] <anew> where can i see what the syntax change is ?
[13:24:29] <Bloomberg> If in the function " newtagleft " how can I access to data properties
[13:24:53] <NoiseEee> anew: someParent.on('click','.classOfThings(orWhatWasThe.liveSelector',function(){})
[13:24:58] <hye> NoiseEee i looked at that, does look clean for nested ajax calls in a loop
[13:25:01] <boytoy_> Hey what do you guys recommend for client-side validation?
[13:25:10] <boytoy_> I found http://validity.thatscaptaintoyou.com/ and it's looking mighty fine!
[13:25:50] <anew> hmmm damn i'm missing the middle part
[13:25:53] <anew> cant figure out what to put there
[13:25:55] <eTiger13> anew: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:26:04] <NoiseEee> anew: pastebin your .live call
[13:26:10] <NoiseEee> anew: and what you have so far wit .on
[13:26:38] <anew> http://pastebin.com/T5jNQy18 i mean so far all i did was this lol
[13:26:40] <eTiger13> anew: you have to target a dom element that exists in the markup that things get appended to
[13:27:06] <eTiger13> so you have to find a parent of #next that will be in the dom
[13:27:16] <anew> i see
[13:27:22] <anew> <div class="imageContainer" >
[13:27:26] <anew> this is the parent of next
[13:27:32] <anew> so how would i now insert that into on ?
[13:27:51] <NoiseEee> $('div.imageContainer').on('click','#next',function() {})
[13:28:07] <anew> oh so i have it totally backwards ?
[13:28:07] <NoiseEee> assuming the imageContainer div is present at page load / when you assign
[13:28:11] <eTiger13> boytoy_: jquery validatation looks good http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[13:28:11] <anew> i see
[13:28:13] <anew> let me try
[13:28:40] <anew> noiseee why do u do div.imagecontainer and not just .imagecontainer
[13:29:03] <NoiseEee> anew: to be specific really, who knows if that class is on other things
[13:29:26] <anew> excellent
[13:29:30] <anew> good job NoiseEee
[13:29:39] <boytoy_> eTiger13: "this site is a work in progress"... "plz donate".. u gotta be kidding me :p
[13:29:49] <Ziber> I've seen a JQuery error for a while now, and I don't quite understand why. http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/ - try adding an item to one of the lists. devtools shows a jquery error.

[13:30:55] <Ziber> o.o
[13:30:59] <Ziber> Really?!
[13:31:00] <BillCriswell> It's just not working at all.
[13:31:08] <Ziber> Right, I know that.
[13:31:08] <BillCriswell> Which is an error... but no error message!
[13:31:25] <Ziber> Do you have devtools open to trace the error?
[13:31:36] <BillCriswell> Yeah, console is open.
[13:31:45] <eTiger13> boytoy_: the site is a work in progress. the plugin has been around for years
[13:32:01] <Ziber> huh.
[13:32:14] <eTiger13> boytoy_: "The plugin is written and maintained by Jörn Zaefferer, a member of the jQuery team, lead developer on the jQuery UI team and maintainer of QUnit. It was started back in the early days of jQuery in 2006, and updated and improved since then"
[13:32:17] <Ziber> Not console, there won't be logs or anything.
[13:32:37] <Ziber> Do you see the call stack?
[13:33:20] <eTiger13> Ziber: "query: INSERT INTO drag_items (`id`, `iid`, `text`, `update_ts`, `pos`) n											values('LezedJEy00', 'hMuuznbiRk', 'hello', '1379709186', '13')
[13:33:20] <eTiger13> error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'n											values('LezedJEy00', 'hMuuznbiRk', 'hello', '1379709186', '13')' at line 1"
[13:33:32] <eTiger13> check the ajax responses
[13:33:37] * Ziber blinks
[13:34:00] <Ziber> Oh, look at that.
[13:34:03] <Ziber> I hadn't even looked there.
[13:34:52] <OHNERO> Hey guys, I am having some trouble calculating an image height once the page loads on iPhone. Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/pXvxF/
[13:35:03] <OHNERO> Here is the page I am having trouble with: http://ct.paradoxsites.com/
[13:35:16] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/ahOZIjU/1/edit -- how come switching options inside the <select> won't trigger the alert?
[13:35:17] <OHNERO> Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't based on how fast the image loads
[13:35:24] <Naruki> Howdy. Can someone explain the "crossDomain" setting to me beyond the simple blurb found here? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:35:30] <jedimind> OHNERO you know you can avoid most of that if you just specify height/width on the <img> tag
[13:35:33] <jedimind> it also helps with your content loading
[13:35:38] <jedimind> but that may not always be possible
[13:35:40] <shoky> boytoy_: check your console
[13:36:13] <OHNERO> jedimind: I can specify a width/height because I am building it to be responsive with twitter bootstrap
[13:36:33] <boytoy_> shoky: ah that didnt come up in firefox
[13:36:43] <boytoy_> i see it in chrome though, thanks
[13:37:48] <diphtherial> hey, anyone happen to know of a fast way to search for an element with a particular data value?
[13:37:56] <diphtherial> i.e. one that was set via data()
[13:38:01] <Naruki> We use JSON on HTTPS, not JSONP.
[13:38:34] <Naruki> Not sure if that's specifically relevant to understanding the ins and outs, though
[13:39:21] <eTiger13> Naruki: do you know what jsonp is?
[13:39:31] <diphtherial> i'm a little nervous about using "td[data-key=32]" or whatever, since if the element is removed and reattached to the dom i'm not sure the attribute will be preserved
[13:39:31] <Naruki> Yes, but we aren't using it
[13:41:28] <Naruki> We had a situation where we made an ajax call from subdomainA.domain.com to subdomainB.domain.com, but it refused to send cookies rooted at .domain.com unless we set withCredentials=true.
[13:41:38] <Naruki> This happened on Firefox
[13:42:02] <raj> is ajax's url setting relative?
[13:42:11] <raj> if I leave out the domain and stuff
[13:42:24] <shoky> raj yea
[13:42:34] <OHNERO> Can someone tell me if this jQuery is okay? http://jsfiddle.net/HCp2s/
[13:42:44] <Ziber> What was the function I could use to stop two functions from triggering? event.disableDefault()?
[13:42:48] <raj> oooh, shoky, we're actually awake during the same hour
[13:42:55] <shoky> ;P
[13:43:12] <Naruki> Because we cannot discard Firefox users, the decision was made to set withCredentials=true on all Ajax calls just in case weird bugs popped up.
[13:43:58] <Naruki> Somebody suggested that setting crossDomain=true could accomplish the same task, but that seems to be strictly related to doing redirects from same domain to another domain
[13:43:58] <eTiger13> OHNERO: you should be caching your selectors
[13:44:33] <Naruki> the documentation is not entirely clear, and I cannot find people discussing it on Google without talking about JSONP
[13:45:00] <eTiger13> Naruki: have you tried reading the source for it
[13:45:06] <OHNERO> eTiger13: Good idea, ill do that now. Other than that does the code look okay? I had to set an interval to determine the width and height because on iPhone it loaded the bigger image.
[13:45:06] <Naruki> I tried
[13:45:08] <yaw> I find it difficult to understand caching because of the different contexts it's been used in :(
[13:45:11] <Naruki> my head melted a little
[13:45:34] <eTiger13> yaw: huh?
[13:45:47] <yaw> eTiger13: fetch 'em once and use every time?
[13:46:22] <eTiger13> yes
[13:46:44] <eTiger13> what do you mean "because of the different contexts it's been used in"?
[13:46:54] <eTiger13> you mean the word caching? or the cached selectors
[13:47:05] <yaw> eTiger13: the word caching
[13:47:25] <eTiger13> its the same in all context
[13:47:47] <eTiger13> save something once that is otherwise used multiple times for better performance
[13:50:01] <Ziber> on a keypress event, I can check to see if enter was pressed by event.keyCode == 13, right?
[13:50:29] <yaw> eTiger13: do you know where I can find documentation on how JavaScript HTML APIs are actually implemented? something like how `getElementById` works
[13:50:53] <Naruki> w3c.org?
[13:51:56] <NoiseEee> Naruki: you either have to use jsonp or set up CORS on the server; what you want to do is against same-origin-policy
[13:52:11] <Naruki> yaw: http://reference.sitepoint.com/javascript/Element
[13:53:04] <Naruki> same-origin is supposed to always send cookies, but Firefox has a bug when the subdomains are different (possibly because of HTTPS)
[13:53:51] <Naruki> using  withCredentials forces it to send the cookie anyway
[13:54:19] <yaw> Naruki: Thanks
[13:54:20] <Naruki> JSONP is for getting back data, which is unrelated to what I am talking about.
[13:54:26] <Naruki> And we already do use CORS
[13:54:37] <Naruki> but that's for stuff that goes cross-domain
[13:55:42] <Naruki> I wanted to understand what the crossDomain does explicitly so I could tell the other person that it WILL or WILL NOT work
[13:56:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why does chrome not load src="assets/js/core.js" and firefox does?
[13:56:58] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Need more details.
[13:57:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it doesn't load the JS file
[13:57:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I go in chrome to source code
[13:57:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and click on core.js
[13:57:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> nothing happens
[13:57:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> locally I mean
[13:58:22] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: Is there a weird security setting or something?
[13:58:37] <BillCriswell> Are you looking over file:///?
[13:59:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I guess, because online it does work
[14:01:43] <Naruki> The doc says that crossDomain allows FOR EXAMPLE server-side redirection to another domain. But it doesn't give the general rule. Is that example, in fact, the only effect of setting crossDomain=TRUE?
[14:02:11] <Naruki> so it has no effect on cookies or anything else?
[14:02:41] <Naruki> does anyone know whom to ask?
[14:03:15] <NoiseEee> Naruki: doesn't that depend on you setting cookies for .mySite.com  and not mySite.com  ?
[14:03:32] <eTiger13> yaw: mozilla developer network
[14:03:58] <eTiger13> having a conversation on twitter is dumb. why am i keeping it up?
[14:04:01] <Naruki> NoiseEee: I think we tried it both ways, but without forcing "withCredentials" it wouldn't go
[14:04:44] <NoiseEee> if you want cookies on both subdomains Naruki, you simply *must* set them to .myDomain.com and not myDomain.com
[14:04:45] <Naruki> the request went as a same-origin request (no preflight), but the cookies were not sent with it
[14:04:58] <Naruki> Okay, but that IS what we set them to originally
[14:05:17] <NoiseEee> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14462423/cross-domain-post-request-is-not-sending-cookie-ajax-jquery @ Naruki ?
[14:05:20] <Naruki> and they are still set that way. I am just saying we tried it the other way, too
[14:05:29] <yaw> eTiger13: I'm looking for how the method is implemented in code. Not how it's supposed to be used
[14:05:46] <eTiger13> getElementById is a native js function
[14:06:07] <snover> that is not a correct statement
[14:06:27] <eTiger13> ok its a native DOM interaction function
[14:06:37] <BillCriswell> Today was moving quick... slowed down a lot
[14:06:59] <eTiger13> geez snover always gotta be right dont ya? (even though you are)
[14:07:20] <snover> it is defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html
[14:08:46] <Naruki> NoiseEee: that person is actually doing a cross-domain POST. We are not.
[14:09:09] <NoiseEee> Naruki: switch the "POST" to "GET" ?
[14:09:18] <Naruki> No, we are doing a POST
[14:09:23] <NoiseEee> ....
[14:09:23] <Naruki> but on the same domain
[14:09:25] <yaw> so I have to checkout WebKit or Blink to find out how it's implemented
[14:09:50] <Naruki> the cookie was already set before calling the $.ajax()
[14:10:28] <Naruki> the only thing we could find was that the page was on a different subdomain from the server with the API
[14:10:30] <NoiseEee> Naruki: blah1.yourSite.com and blah2.yourSite.com might as well be completely different domains as far as Same Origin Policy is concerned with XHR/ajax
[14:11:07] <Naruki> NoiseEee: regarding cookies, yes?
[14:11:14] <NoiseEee> regarding everything.
[14:11:21] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript @ Naruki
[14:11:27] <Naruki> but the AJAX call successfully went to the server
[14:11:33] <Naruki> it just failed to send any cookies with it
[14:12:30] <eTiger13> because its a different domain is what NoiseEee is saying
[14:12:39] <Naruki> gotcha
[14:13:35] <NoiseEee> Naruki: where are you using "withCredentials"
[14:13:57] <NoiseEee> Naruki: check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8863571/cors-request-why-are-the-cookies-not-sent and compare your code to the answer?
[14:14:32] <kamikaz3> has anyone in here used the YUI calendar plugin ?
[14:15:31] <Naruki> NoiseEee: we do this before calling $.ajax(settings):        setting.xhrFields.withCredentials = true;
[14:15:35] <JesseC> Anyone ever use the real360 jQuery plugin made by Petr Vostrel? I'm having some trouble understanding how the sprites should be made. None of the ones I create work correctly with the rotation.
[14:25:34] <raj> shoky, at the end of all that hash trouble ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18808148/history-js-getfullurl-and-extractstate-and-pushstate-issue ), I basically just came around to using query strings
[14:26:14] <raj> just fyi
[14:27:22] <anew> so i'm using .on('click' ... i click it once everything works (it's a facebox popup)... but if i close the box and try clicking again, it doesnt work?
[14:30:56] <anew> i got it
[14:38:41] <Naruki> Thanks for the input, guys. Will have to test stuff to see if my understanding is correct.
[14:38:46] <Naruki> g'nite!
[15:06:06] <anew> how can i get full url with jquery including all subomdains ?
[15:07:48] <freeeno> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[15:08:10] <freeeno> anyone know what's the most likely cause
[15:08:18] <freeeno> how to debug it?
[15:09:24] <eTiger13> anew: window.location ?
[15:09:36] <eTiger13> freeeno: did you lint your json? jsonlint.com
[15:10:24] <freeeno> it's not my code and i dont know which part of the code and which file the json resied
[15:14:57] <anew> thx eTiger13
[15:32:51] <delboy1978uk> hi
[15:32:53] <blizzkid> ping delboy1978uk
[15:33:16] <delboy1978uk> ok so what you trying to click? does it have an id?
[15:34:05] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: let me explain what I want to do from scratch
[15:34:10] <delboy1978uk> ok
[15:35:16] <blizzkid> I'm trying to write a very simple interface to edit bind9 zone files (only the records, not the SOA). I read in the file, split it, and display the existing records row by row in 3 readonly input boxes
[15:35:28] <blizzkid> name, type and fqdn
[15:36:05] <blizzkid> on each row there's an edit button/link (to be decided) and  a delete button/link (to be decided)
[15:36:22] <blizzkid> when I click edit, it should remove the readonly attribute from the textboxes
[15:36:58] <blizzkid> to complicate it a little, it should only do so for the row that has been clciked
[15:42:23] <Velveeta> interesting, my colloquy never connected from work at all today… and i didn't even notice
[15:45:38] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: you still here? :)
[15:45:59] <delboy1978uk> yeah sorry on phone hold on
[15:46:09] <blizzkid> np
[15:53:38] <k1t_> Hey folks. If I have a UL and a DIV element inside a container and the DIV is in context, can I use sibling() to get the UL?
[15:55:43] <k1t_> Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/2XD6e/
[15:55:48] <k1t_> Should that work?
[15:56:24] <Velveeta> yes, it should work
[15:56:53] <Velveeta> but you should also know that just using $('#list') in that sense is probably gonna be just as fast, since it involves an id selector
[15:59:24] <k1t_> Hmmm Velveeta I don't think it's working: http://jsfiddle.net/2XD6e/2/ (finished the fiddle)
[16:00:09] <Garbee> k1t_, You aren't including jquery.
[16:00:09] <Velveeta> have you checked your console on that page? "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined "
[16:00:35] <k1t_> buaha Ty Garbee and excuse me Velveeta :) Sorry don't use fiddle much
[16:01:09] <k1t_> And it works. Thanks guys
[16:01:27] <k1t_> Will remember to include dependencies next to on fiddle ;)
[16:01:31] <k1t_> next time *
[16:01:34] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[16:02:57] <codepython777> how does one do a search on a FAQ page: http://wbpreview.com/previews/WB000C138/faq.html ? is there a package for searching?
[16:08:12] <delboy1978uk> blizzkid sorry was caught on the phone there
[16:08:23] <delboy1978uk> hold on till i scroll back and catch up
[16:08:27] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: np
[16:09:33] <delboy1978uk> ok each row button should have a class="edit-button" or something yeah?
[16:10:11] <boytoy_> At this Packery setup full of vids and photos: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/s7ydV/1/embedded/result/ -- since all divs are the same size it all looks kinda blocky. Anybody know of a nice way I can give random sizes to my divs and also fill out all empty spaces?
[16:10:20] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: yeah
[16:10:31] <delboy1978uk> ok so jquery
[16:11:20] <delboy1978uk> $('.edit-button').click(function(){  alert('button clicked');   });
[16:11:30] <delboy1978uk> i take it that is working?
[16:11:51] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk:  where do I put that? (like I said: total js/jquery noob)
[16:12:20] <delboy1978uk> total newb? ok at the bottom of your html….
[16:12:28] <delboy1978uk> (hold on i'll paste you)
[16:14:12] <delboy1978uk> http://pastie.org/8342916
[16:17:13] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: it doesn't work with <a href class="edit-button">, does it only work with <button>?
[16:17:38] <delboy1978uk> paste your row for me
[16:18:43] <blizzkid> http://pastie.org/8342926
[16:19:45] <delboy1978uk> it should
[16:19:57] <delboy1978uk> what browser you using? can you get a console?
[16:20:24] <blizzkid> Safari and FF
[16:20:57] <delboy1978uk> ok safari cmd alt i and bring it up look at the console, any errors?
[16:21:44] <blizzkid> yeah, ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $
[16:22:40] <blizzkid> but it's an error in the line print "</form>";
[16:24:31] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/
[16:24:39] <delboy1978uk> yeah jquery isn't loaded
[16:24:42] <delboy1978uk> hold on then
[16:25:01] <delboy1978uk> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[16:25:27] <delboy1978uk> paste that into the <head> section of your html
[16:25:38] <delboy1978uk> that loads jquery from googles server
[16:25:41] <blizzkid> yeah, that's much better
[16:25:45] <blizzkid> *ashamed*
[16:25:48] <delboy1978uk> lol
[16:26:02] <delboy1978uk> np, we all start somewhere
[16:27:00] <blizzkid> ok, so now I get the alert
[16:29:49] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: now, how would I make that button $id clicked? where $id is the (dynamically generated) id of the button?
[16:29:53] <delboy1978uk> ok so now you have to get the readonly text box
[16:30:30] <delboy1978uk> <input class="read-write" id="tb_name" type="text" value="$pieces[0]" readonly />
[16:30:38] <delboy1978uk> give it a class of read/write
[16:30:46] <delboy1978uk> that way we can find it
[16:30:56] <delboy1978uk> read-write sorry
[16:31:05] <blizzkid> ok, hold on
[16:31:34] <blizzkid> done
[16:32:37] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/3/
[16:33:38] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: ok
[16:33:51] <blizzkid> so far I understand
[16:34:22] <blizzkid> but.... what happens now when I have this on multiple rows and with multiple buttons? (or am I going too fast?)
[16:35:35] <delboy1978uk> no because $(this) is the button you clicked
[16:35:42] <delboy1978uk> .parent() is the td
[16:35:49] <delboy1978uk> and .parent() again is the tr
[16:36:00] <blizzkid> I see, cool
[16:36:05] <delboy1978uk> .find() looks within itself
[16:36:35] <delboy1978uk> so then you would use .attr() to set the attribute
[16:36:52] <delboy1978uk> or even .removeAttr('readonly');
[16:37:04] <blizzkid> so... input.removeAttr("readonly");?
[16:37:26] <delboy1978uk> although jsfiddle seems to screw up here
[16:37:37] <delboy1978uk> its good but its buggy i find
[16:38:01] <delboy1978uk> don't know whether I'm wrong or right, although it works for other attributes like disabled
[16:38:34] <Velveeta> what's the question? sorry, i'm watching tv and not paying attention :)
[16:39:22] <blizzkid> doesn't seem to work with input.removeAttr('readonly'), but no error
[16:39:48] <blizzkid> might try with disabled
[16:39:49] <delboy1978uk> try .attr('readonly',false);
[16:39:51] <Velveeta> oh, for a property like readonly, you probably want to use .prop instead of attr
[16:40:02] <delboy1978uk> yeah do that it usually works for me
[16:40:21] <delboy1978uk> oh yeah that too lol
[16:40:22] <blizzkid> Velveeta: removeprop() or prop("readonly", false)?
[16:40:26] <delboy1978uk> whats the difference
[16:40:27] <delboy1978uk> ?
[16:40:31] <Velveeta> blizzkid: .prop('readonly', false)
[16:40:51] <Velveeta> so, the .attr function represents the inline attribute on the element itself, which is not necessarily reflective of its actual dom state
[16:41:04] <Velveeta> .prop modifies the actual dom property in question
[16:41:23] <blizzkid> [Error] SyntaxError: Expected an identifier but found '.' instead
[16:41:31] <mdev> I hide and unhide a class but when I unhide it shows all messed up
[16:41:33] <Velveeta> similar to checked or disabled, you can set an attribute of checked="checked" and then set the dom property 'checked' to false, and the attribute is not reflective of the actual property value
[16:41:33] <mdev> why is that?
[16:41:51] <delboy1978uk> you've missed a semicolon or some crap out
[16:41:55] <Velveeta> mdev: when you say unhide, do you mean .show() or do you mean something else?
[16:42:19] <mdev> yes
[16:42:24] <mdev> .hide() and .show()
[16:43:16] <blizzkid> ok, no syntax error, no error in console whatsoever, but doesn't become editable.
[16:43:27] <Velveeta> mdev: not sure, is there a fiddle or something we can look out?
[16:43:44] <blizzkid> input.prop('readonly', false); --> right? (in your example delboy1978uk)
[16:43:57] <delboy1978uk> yeah try that
[16:44:06] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: that's what I tried
[16:44:15] <blizzkid> doesn't make it active
[16:44:20] <blizzkid> still readonly
[16:44:26] <Velveeta> blizzkid: is there an updated fiddle to see?
[16:44:51] <blizzkid> Velveeta: no, but I can quickly do it, hold on
[16:45:20] <blizzkid> well, Velveeta, just look at http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/3/
[16:45:41] <blizzkid> I added input.prop('readonly', false); after the alert
[16:48:16] <delboy1978uk> I'm trying all sorts here, this should be easy! have you tried it in your actual site rather than on jsfiddle?
[16:48:26] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: yeah
[16:48:33] <Velveeta> so, it *is* working properly, something seems to be resetting it
[16:49:06] <blizzkid> Velveeta: maybe because I use a href?
[16:49:35] <Velveeta> oh dammit, yes, i missed that :D
[16:49:36] <delboy1978uk> nah
[16:49:42] <delboy1978uk> eh?
[16:49:45] <delboy1978uk> look back
[16:49:55] <blizzkid> I'm a genious :p
[16:49:56] <Velveeta> it's possible that it's interpreting that empty href as href="" and refreshing the page
[16:50:11] <blizzkid> I changed it to div and that works indeed
[16:50:12] <delboy1978uk> lol heres how you get round that:
[16:50:23] <Velveeta> yeah that fixed it
[16:50:42] <Velveeta> here's a way of doing it with your anchor: http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/25/
[16:50:46] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/26/
[16:51:13] <delboy1978uk> i like preventDefault()
[16:51:44] <delboy1978uk> i didn't even notice that href sitting doing nothing lol
[16:52:32] <Velveeta> delboy: i don't know why i didn't go with preventDefault right off the bat, i use that shit on a daily basis :D
[16:52:39] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/27/ with your href back in
[16:52:40] <Velveeta> probably the beer… i blame the beer...
[16:52:48] <delboy1978uk> i blame the smoke
[16:52:50] <Velveeta> and yeah, i hadn't noticed the href either
[16:53:17] <delboy1978uk> i blame the government
[16:53:59] <blizzkid> ok, so that part is solved :)
[16:54:10] <delboy1978uk> anyway! that you sorted blizzkid? I'm getting back to check my bitcoin mining stats now!
[16:54:16] <delboy1978uk> that part lol
[16:54:24] <blizzkid> Now the second part...
[16:54:30] <blizzkid> (might be quick for you)
[16:54:35] <delboy1978uk> ok then lol
[16:54:45] <boytoy_> man i wish i had some weed right now
[16:54:48] <boytoy_> and some beer :/
[16:55:01] <blizzkid> if I click delete I should remove the element that corresponds to that row from the php array :D
[16:55:02] <delboy1978uk> wish i had beer!
[16:55:02] <Velveeta> i'm good w/ just the beer :D
[16:55:09] * boytoy_ continues devving on a coffee high
[16:55:20] * blizzkid hands you all some Belgian beer
[16:55:26] <delboy1978uk> i am drinking a lot of coffee
[16:55:34] <delboy1978uk> i love belgian beer!
[16:55:37] <boytoy_> delboy1978uk: yeah too much :D
[16:55:42] <boytoy_> blizzkid: ooh tasty
[16:55:48] <Velveeta> belgians do know their brewing for sure
[16:55:51] <boytoy_> never had that before
[16:56:09] <duch_kazatel> trappist monks and all that.
[16:56:10] <delboy1978uk> i was in belgium at my friends and  he gave me a gift of 3 bottle of genuine trappist monk beer
[16:56:11] <blizzkid> Velveeta: yeah, we have some 1000'ish different ones atm I guess
[16:56:35] <delboy1978uk> the 3 bottles were 7, 8, & 9% !!!
[16:56:36] <Velveeta> i love a good strong belgian ale
[16:56:50] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: yep, that's a light beer to us :D
[16:56:52] <duch_kazatel> by sister's husband brought along his bottle of Westvleteren 12 for my wedding.
[16:57:05] <duch_kazatel> great stuff.
[16:57:07] <delboy1978uk> and man! the secret ingredient is holy blessings from the almighty programmer
[16:57:07] <Velveeta> my absolute favorite beers are the oktoberfest brews
[16:57:17] <Velveeta> i love those marten malts
[16:57:21] <Velveeta> marzen*
[16:57:26] <duch_kazatel> I'm a huge fan of imperial stouts
[16:57:41] <blizzkid> but that aside, delboy1978uk you think that it might be a quick fix?
[16:57:41] <delboy1978uk> those monks sure know how to get you high on beer
[16:58:07] <delboy1978uk> whats a quick fix?
[16:58:36] <blizzkid> when I click delete the item in the php array that corresponds to that row should be deleted
[16:59:12] <briefcaseofguts> anyone know why when i try to write a plugin and its evaluated, "this" is a (window) object and it breaks chrome
[16:59:13] <Velveeta> so, the php array doesn't exist in the client
[16:59:18] <blizzkid> (basically the first row is the first el of the array)
[16:59:24] <delboy1978uk> what delete button? i thought it was an edit button we just made
[16:59:31] <blizzkid> Velveeta: I realize that
[16:59:35] <Velveeta> briefcaseofguts: is it in a nested function inside the plugin?
[16:59:41] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: yeah, second button is the delete button,
[16:59:44] <delboy1978uk> so your adding a delete one now?
[16:59:51] <blizzkid> yep
[16:59:58] <delboy1978uk> and when you click it, it deletes a row?
[17:00:03] <blizzkid> yep
[17:00:15] <delboy1978uk> and removes it from database/file/data-source?
[17:00:22] <blizzkid> and it deletes the element from the php array
[17:00:28] <briefcaseofguts> Velveeta: naw (i think), the code is jQuery.fn.filterstuff = function (text, mode) { return this.each( /* do filter */ })})
[17:00:41] <blizzkid> (only after "save" a new file is generated)
[17:00:42] <delboy1978uk> there is no php by this stage
[17:00:57] <briefcaseofguts> the return this.each breaks ... b/c this is now Window... but it used to work fine (then chrome updated to blink maybe?)
[17:00:57] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: nah, I have some php generating the rows
[17:01:05] <delboy1978uk> its all html by the time js starts
[17:01:26] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: I realize that, but we can reload the page if needed
[17:01:32] <briefcaseofguts> its called like my_select.filterstuff('asdf', seriousmode)
[17:01:34] <delboy1978uk> where is the php getting this info from?
[17:01:39] <BillCriswell> http://www.bentobox.io/ I'd love to know what the big fuss about this is? Highly rated on reddit and hackernews right now.
[17:01:45] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: it reads a bind9 zone file
[17:02:01] <delboy1978uk> what the heck is one of those?
[17:02:23] <delboy1978uk> so would php need to delete that line from this file then?
[17:02:38] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: no, not immediately
[17:02:45] <blizzkid> only after user hits "save"
[17:03:01] <briefcaseofguts> BillCriswell: the tutorials seemed above average to me
[17:03:02] <delboy1978uk> ah right ok
[17:03:03] <blizzkid> like that, if he changes his mind nothing is lost
[17:03:21] <delboy1978uk> so you edit stuff on the fly, adding and removing, then hit save
[17:03:32] <delboy1978uk> where it posts everything to get processed
[17:03:56] <blizzkid> yep, and when you hit save, a new temp file is generated, conformity check done, and if ok old file gets overwritten
[17:04:21] <delboy1978uk> ok cool so you just want to visually remove those rows?
[17:04:33] <delboy1978uk> and make a note of ids to delete
[17:04:41] <blizzkid> correct
[17:05:13] <delboy1978uk> ok we need a hidden div or something we can dump the deleted id's into
[17:05:23] <blizzkid> so we might change <tr> to <tr id="1">
[17:05:33] <delboy1978uk> isn't the id the table name?
[17:05:41] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: I'd prefer a POST variable
[17:05:53] <delboy1978uk> whatever you'r happy with
[17:05:56] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: no the table holds all records
[17:06:07] <blizzkid> 1 record = 1 row
[17:06:14] <delboy1978uk> ok so id your rows
[17:06:22] <blizzkid> yeah
[17:07:03] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[17:09:10] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/KLgEU/28/
[17:11:27] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: that seems to work, apart from *my* $lineid++ being completely ignored (it's getting late)
[17:11:47] <blizzkid> now, I'd still prefer a POST variable instead of a div ;)
[17:12:05] <delboy1978uk> explain what you mean
[17:12:51] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: php while loop print $lineid; $lineid++;
[17:13:13] <delboy1978uk> paste your loop
[17:13:33] <delboy1978uk> $lineid = 1 ?
[17:13:41] <delboy1978uk> did you set it to begin with?
[17:15:10] <blizzkid> yeah, but I overlooked a closing bracket, so put the ++ outside the loop. (like I said: it's getting late, 2:15 AM)
[17:16:09] <blizzkid> ok, so far it works ok
[17:16:43] <delboy1978uk> nice one i gtg
[17:17:25] <blizzkid> ok, thanks already. I'll try to figure out how to put in POST variable instead of div :)
[17:17:29] <blizzkid> thanks again!
[17:17:32] <delboy1978uk> hope this helped you get started with jquery awesomeness!
[17:17:47] <blizzkid> btw, any *good* book to start with?
[17:17:48] <delboy1978uk> i still don't know what your meaning by that?
[17:17:57] <delboy1978uk> jquery novice to ninja
[17:18:07] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: nevrmind, I'll work it out
[17:18:19] <blizzkid> see you!
[17:18:27] <delboy1978uk> echo $_POST['variable']?
[17:19:03] <blizzkid> delboy1978uk: don't think it's *that* easy :)
[17:19:18] <delboy1978uk> well where is this variable?
[17:19:44] <blizzkid> it's a php thing, but I'll put stuff in a hidden input field, that'll make it easier
[17:19:59] <blizzkid> now, I'm going to sleeeeeeppppzzzzzz
[17:20:20] <delboy1978uk> kk catch u l8r
[17:20:27] <blizzkid> thanks again, and thank you Velveeta too!

[18:01:46] <MACscr> anyone in here got IE? Can you test this for me and tell me if you can enter a number in any of the input fields that is larger than 5? http://jsfiddle.net/zm2Gq/19/
[18:02:08] <duch_kazatel> MACscr which version(s) of IE?
[18:02:44] <MACscr> any. Im on a mac, so i have none of them
[18:02:55] <MACscr> please report which version you are trying though
[18:03:25] <duch_kazatel> IE10, and yes I can enter a number larger than 5.  same with firefox.
[18:04:20] <MACscr> odd. i cant in FF or Chrome
[18:04:35] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "enter a number larger than 5"?
[18:04:48] <MACscr> can you enter the number 6
[18:04:55] <duch_kazatel> lol no but I can enter 10
[18:05:14] <MACscr> hmm, guess i need to figure a way to limit it to a single digit as well
[18:05:53] <Velveeta> there's a size property that should limit it to single digit
[18:06:07] <Velveeta> admittedly, i just jumped into this conversation, so i may be way off track
[18:06:13] <MACscr> as in html size="1" ?
[18:06:18] <duch_kazatel> you could also check the change event and let the user know when they put in a value that's too big.
[18:06:45] <Velveeta> as in <input size="1" />
[18:06:55] <MACscr> right, i have that already
[18:07:07] <Velveeta> the change event won't fire until blur though, so it depends on what's acceptable for validation purposes
[18:07:18] <Velveeta> if you want it to fire live, you'd want a keypress or something
[18:07:19] <duch_kazatel> Change fires on blur for me.
[18:09:10] <MACscr> oh, woops, i would think it would be maxlength="1"
[18:10:08] <MACscr> that seems to work
[18:24:37] <diphtherial> hey, anyone here have much experience with writing plugins? i'm wondering how i can expose my settings object to other methods in my plugin's class
[18:24:47] <diphtherial> right now it's defined inside of my init method
[18:27:23] <diphtherial> never mind, just moved the object to the top level of the plugin and updated it from init, seems to work fine
[18:37:30] <Velveeta> a lot of people like writing plugins when what they should be writing are widgets w/ the UI factory
[18:38:07] <Velveeta> if you have options that need to be exposed for customization, or that may need to be altered after the fact, and/or you have state that needs to be tracked, you should be using the widget factory vs a plugin
[18:38:40] <Velveeta> plugins should be used for one-time executed actions, like iterating over objects (.each()) or setting display properties (.css, .show, .hide, etc)
[18:50:17] <Ziggy`> http://jsfiddle.net/4ef5r/3/ - Could I somehow go through every anchor in list item, and add padding to it, and increment the padding when there's a child..
[18:55:01] <Velveeta> with css or javascript?
[18:57:22] <Ziggy`> Velveeta: Pretty sure I can't do it with css
[18:57:35] <MACscr> hmm, if I have panels like so http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/16/ with a continue button, what do you guys think would be the smoothest technique to make sure the user is brought to the top of the next panel when they hit continue versus to the next continue button?
[18:57:37] <Ziggy`> Velveeta: But if you know a trick, then show me,
[18:58:02] <Ziggy`> Velveeta: I could manually do .tree li { padding-left: 30px; } .tree li li { padding-left: 50px; } ..
[18:58:17] <Ziggy`> But I have a tree that can be very nested.
[18:58:40] <Velveeta> ziggy: probably the best way to do it would be with a combination of css and js
[18:59:07] <Velveeta> macscr: you'll probably want to calculate the offset().top of each accordion area and set the scrollTop to that value
[18:59:09] <Ziggy`> I'm looking for way..
[18:59:11] <Ziggy`> ways*
[19:00:33] <Velveeta> ziggy: you could define css classes for things like li > a { padding: whatever } and then li > a + ul.hasChildren { padding: whatever }, and fire some js that would do something like $('ul:has(li)').addClass('hasChildren');
[19:00:55] <Velveeta> so you're only searching for hl's that have children, and setting a class on them, which would then trigger a css rule
[19:01:06] <Velveeta> rather than hardcoding a padding value into your js
[19:01:47] <Ziggy`> Yeah, but still.. that doesn't really solve it.
[19:01:55] <Velveeta> how does it not?
[19:02:05] <Velveeta> unless i'm missing part of the problem you're trying to solve
[19:02:37] <MACscr> if they are nested, should they already build off each other?
[19:02:47] <Ziggy`> Setting the padding of li > a + ul.hasChildren { padding-left:50px; } .. no matter how deep it is, it will be 50px for every single one.
[19:03:16] <Velveeta> ziggy: you want the padding compounded?
[19:03:31] <MACscr> ah, its because your adding the padding to the anchors instead
[19:03:38] <Ziggy`> I want the padding on the anchor itself.
[19:03:43] <Ziggy`> not the list item.
[19:03:47] <Velveeta> right, the padding would be on the anchor itself
[19:05:07] <MACscr> Ziggy`: is this for a menu?
[19:05:55] <MACscr> unless you are selling a script, i would just right out a few nested css rules and be done with it
[19:06:03] <MACscr> er, write
[19:06:41] <Velveeta> li > a + ul.hasChildren is much more elegant than writing several nested css rules though
[19:06:57] <Velveeta> the adjacent sibling selector targets the tag to the left of the +
[19:07:02] <Velveeta> in this case, the anchor
[19:07:19] <Velveeta> so any anchor followed immediately by a ul.hasChildren element will inherit the properties of that rule
[19:08:33] <Ziggy`> li > a + ul.hasChildren will actually set the padding to the next ul element
[19:08:44] <Velveeta> no, it targets the anchor
[19:08:56] <Ziggy`> http://jsfiddle.net/4ef5r/5/
[19:08:58] <Ziggy`> take a look
[19:09:03] <Velveeta> that's how the adjacent sibling selector works, it targets any anchor followed by a ul.hasChildren
[19:09:50] <Velveeta> wtf, that's not right :D
[19:10:23] <Velveeta> oh goddamnit, i had it backwards
[19:10:43] <Velveeta> it targets the 2nd sibling where the 1st sibling exists
[19:11:37] <Velveeta> in that case, you'll probably have to do it entirely in js
[19:13:03] <MACscr> grr, I dont get it, why is it that all i did was simply add some logic for doing the scroll offset and now my preventDefault() isnt working and its trying to post the form? http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/17/
[19:13:55] <Velveeta> because you're throwing an exception as part of that click now
[19:14:48] <Velveeta> collapseh === null
[19:15:37] <Velveeta> those .collapse nodes don't have a .in node to target with your $('.collapse .in') selector
[19:18:27] <Velveeta> you probably want to reference $('.panel-collapse.in')
[19:18:32] <Velveeta> no space
[19:19:36] <MACscr> pardon my ignorance, but what exception?
[19:27:07] <Velveeta> sorry, was answering a space question on Facebook :D
[19:27:10] <joobz> hey guys.. is there a way to create some sort of listener or event handler, such that when a DIV with a particular ID is added to the DOM, my JS can trigger? I don't want to bind this to the actual code that adds the element to the DOM, rather I want to watch the DOM and fire when it appears.. if this is possible? I'm thinking it can be done with a timer loop, but prefer to have it run more so as a listener type event
[19:27:22] <MACscr> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/19/. I updated my code a bit, still not sure about the exception part
[19:27:28] <MACscr> no problem at all
[19:28:08] <Velveeta> Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) { } has no method 'scrollTo'
[19:28:55] <Velveeta> $.scrollTo is undefined
[19:28:57] <MACscr> ah, poop, i should have looked at the console
[19:29:53] <Velveeta> joobz: we have something similar at my company, and it does involve a timer, setInterval to be exact
[19:30:05] <joobz> ahh
[19:30:09] <Velveeta> we use it to fire a callback when an element becomes visible
[19:30:43] <Velveeta> and it polls every 25ms for element.is(':visible'), you could use something similar for document.getElementById(id) !== undefined
[19:31:23] <joobz> ya.. just trying to do it without the extra load
[19:32:32] <Velveeta> right, i don't think there's a way to do it without polling the dom
[19:32:56] <Velveeta> unless you bind to the function that inserts it, which you said you didn't wanna do
[19:33:11] <Velveeta> now, you could *sort of* decouple those with a deferred object
[19:33:19] <joobz> I cant.. im running this JS ontop of another page that i dont have control over
[19:33:27] <Velveeta> ahhhh then nevermind
[19:33:39] <Velveeta> that page doesn't broadcast any events?
[19:33:39] <joobz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7434685/event-when-element-added-to-page
[19:33:42] <joobz> have a look at that post
[19:33:48] <joobz> go down to the guy where he talks about livequery
[19:33:59] <joobz> i cant seem to find that livequery library anymore.. maybe it's depreciated
[19:34:15] <joobz> they also talk about DOM Mutation Events in there, but that's depreciated
[19:35:06] <Velveeta> yeah, and mutation observers were never fully supported across browsers
[19:36:26] <joobz> ahh
[19:36:30] <Velveeta> livequery probably wouldn't work for you either… that answer states "The answer above was only meant to detect that an item has been added to the DOM through the plugin."
[19:36:52] <joobz> that's all i want though
[19:36:53] <Velveeta> and since you don't have access to modify the code that injects the element, it's pretty safe to say you can't make that code inject it through whatever mechanism livequery had set up
[19:36:57] <joobz> to detect that an element is in the DOM
[19:37:14] <joobz> I can inject through my code
[19:37:27] <joobz> like i can manipulate the generated DOM
[19:37:42] <joobz> I just can't manipulate the JS that generated the DOM
[19:37:48] <joobz> .. if that makes sense :P

[19:38:09] <Velveeta> it uses a setTimeout also, so it's just polling the dom anyway
[19:38:21] <Velveeta> i don't think you're gonna find any more elegant solution than that
[19:38:35] <joobz> ahh
[19:38:46] <joobz> thanks Velveeta
[19:38:46] <Velveeta> and it's polling every 20ms
[19:38:49] <joobz> in terms of setTimeout
[19:38:52] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:38:57] <joobz> i am looking for div class=moo
[19:39:21] <joobz> what do you think the most efficent way is to check it's there in the timer
[19:39:31] <joobz> .. given i am already wasting i/o wtih the timer :P
[19:40:02] <joobz> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ this is what im using BTW Velveeta
[19:40:08] <joobz> .. which is why im limited
[19:40:11] <Velveeta> the most efficient way would be if you know the area of the document that it's scoped to at least, cache that dom reference and use that cached reference for your .moo parsing going forward with your polling
[19:40:26] <Velveeta> ahhhh ok it's a greasemonkey script
[19:41:50] <joobz> ya
[19:42:13] <joobz> have you played with greasemonkey? it looks pretty cool
[19:43:46] <joobz> BTW Velveeta .. in the interest of minimizing i/o, do you think i can better optimize if ($("div.moo").is(":visible")) { } for the timer condition?
[19:43:49] <MACscr> Well i added the scrollTo plugin, but still no luck. No errors this time either. http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/19/
[19:44:52] <MACscr> ah, nvm, figured out one part
[19:45:35] <Velveeta> joobz: i haven't done any greasemonkey development myself, but i've written a few chrome extensions, which i'm assuming is a similar matter… if you want to fire a callback when div.moo is added to the document, then doing the .is('visible') check is superfluous
[19:46:26] <joobz> thanks Velveeta
[19:46:32] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:46:34] <joobz> I had to google superfluous btw :P
[19:46:58] <Morl0ck> Hello
[19:47:14] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:50:01] <Morl0ck> I have a question
[19:50:17] <Morl0ck> using the $.extend in a plugin
[19:50:43] <Morl0ck> http://jsfiddle.net/Morlock0821/86Bsr/
[19:51:13] <Morl0ck> I wanna know how to do defaults for all the arrays in boxes
[19:55:22] <Velveeta> there's no way to have defaults for N number of indexes of objects in an array like that, using $.extend
[19:55:44] <Velveeta> you'd have to write a custom function that recursively checks your defaults and applies it to your options object
[19:55:58] <Velveeta> er i guess not 'recursively' but 'iteratively'
[19:56:26] <Morl0ck> i figured that, i was hoping that there was some way :(
[19:58:17] <Morl0ck> Thank
[19:58:18] <Morl0ck> s
[20:00:15] <joobz> hmmm Velveeta
[20:00:26] <joobz> it's not finding the div, even though it's defeinitely there
[20:00:33] <joobz> how can i print the DOM itself?
[20:00:53] <joobz> i tried alert($(document).html()); but it said undefined
[20:02:24] <Velveeta> use $('body').html()
[20:02:42] <Velveeta> but the better way would be to just open a dom inspector, body.html can be a lot of content
[20:05:00] <HarryPitfall> $('html').html() isn't the entire page? (head + body) ?
[20:06:20] <joobz> im seeing weird stuff
[20:06:29] <joobz> in firebug, if i right click the element and inspect it
[20:06:39] <joobz> it comes up, i see div class=moo
[20:06:46] <joobz> but when i view source, it's not in there
[20:06:55] <joobz> when i view generated source, it's not in there either
[20:06:57] <Velveeta> view source is only the source code that was pushed out from the server
[20:06:59] <joobz> only in firebug it sees it
[20:07:09] <joobz> ya, i tried view generated source too and it's not in there
[20:07:18] <joobz> but it is, when i right click and inspect with firebug
[20:07:22] <Velveeta> i've never tried the generated source option, i typically work in chrome these days
[20:07:35] <joobz> view generated source is meant to show you the dom
[20:07:41] <joobz> .. it has in the past for me
[20:09:03] <MACscr> ok, ive tried like a dozen different combinations and i cant seem to get the height() of the new panel after its opened. Seems to always give the height at the original state of the page. Shouldnt that height be changing when next.collapse('show') is ran first? http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/22/
[20:10:13] <mdev> window.alert($('.check_box_number_two').val());
[20:10:16] <mdev> keeps saying on
[20:10:25] <mdev> I want the text value from the checkbox
[20:13:24] <mdev> oh nevermind I didn't set the value :P
[20:13:29] <mdev> I set the text outside hehe
[20:17:31] <mdev> laugh.
[20:27:38] <mdev> this is how I feel using jquery these days http://i.imgur.com/6IPgZrz.gif
[20:27:55] <mdev> wish I had started using it sooner, instead of sticking with raw javascript :)
[20:36:20] <mysteronyx> mdev you're probably better off for it.
[20:44:47] <Velveeta> mdev: nice :D
[20:45:54] <Velveeta> there are still some purists out there that "only want to write in native javascript" but they're few and far between, and are only making things harder on themselves.. why not just write in assembly language :D
[20:51:01] <sahbeewah> sometimes performance is important, and vanilla js is several orders of magnitude faster than jquery in most tasks
[20:51:16] <Velveeta> oh definitely
[20:51:17] <sahbeewah> javascript is the assembly language of the web
[20:51:53] <Velveeta> but when it comes to things like binding event listeners, convenience and a normalized API far outweigh the speed in my eyes
[21:04:34] <Velveeta> so the wife is watching the iheartradio festival in vegas on a livestream right now, and muse is on
[21:04:55] <Velveeta> and i keep forgetting that they're not as terrible as most of the other music that's come out in the past decade or so
[21:25:07] <mdev> I click something that minimizes a box
[21:25:18] <mdev> i need to react after it finishes, how can I do that?
[21:25:36] <mdev> I have callback on click but it fires too fast, and i need to redraw stuff
[21:56:25] <Velveeta> mdev: you still around?
[22:02:15] <MACscr> Velveeta: hmm, i still cant figure out why i cant get the height of #collapseTwo after its opened. Doesnt javascript typically run in order? http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/22/
[22:04:13] <Velveeta> <looking at it now>
[22:07:27] <MACscr> i cleaned it up a bit, this should be a bit more efficient http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/23/, but still measures the .panel closed
[22:09:43] <Velveeta> ok i think i have the answer
[22:10:12] <Velveeta> you're running through some plugin or widget 'show' function, which is animating the opening of each accordion section
[22:10:31] <Velveeta> which means that it's set to slide open little by little over the course of milliseconds, but your code continues to execute as normal
[22:10:46] <Velveeta> meaning that the immediate next line that grabs its height still sees it as 0px
[22:12:07] <MACscr> well i guess is the design of the collapse plugin flawed in the fact that it starts users at the bottom anyway? i guess im not 100% sure why i need to use the scrollTo plugin in the first place
[22:12:44] <MACscr> btw, all the plugins im using are part of twitters bootstrap. the scrollTo plugin is the only one that im using that isnt
[22:14:18] <Velveeta> right, i'm tracing through the bootstrap code right now to see if it emits any events you can tie into for the end of its animation… as far as it "starting users at the bottom", it's not, it's keeping users in the same place they already are, it's just that they have to scroll to the bottom to click that continue button in your case
[22:14:50] <MACscr> ah, just found these two
[22:15:02] <MACscr> show.bs.collapse - This event fires immediately when the show instance method is called.
[22:15:02] <MACscr> shown.bs.collapse - This event is fired when a collapse element has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
[22:15:22] <Velveeta> shown.bs.collapse
[22:15:28] <Velveeta> yep, i was just coming back to paste that for you
[22:15:59] <Velveeta> guess i should have checked the documentation instead of the code, would have found that event name faster :D
[22:16:19] <Velveeta> so you need to tie your height calculations to a next.on('shown.bs.collapse', function () {});
[22:16:49] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/24/
[22:16:53] <MACscr> sweet. works
[22:17:01] <MACscr> thanks for helping me troubleshoot that
[22:17:13] <Velveeta> and in that function, you should probably receive 'e' and immediately do a $(this).off(e) so as to remove the event to prevent multiple bindings, unless you want to bind all of them up at load time as opposed to per-click
[22:17:43] <Velveeta> no problem
[22:22:03] <MACscr> grr, the action is kind of ugly on my actual code though. Having it scroll down to the bottom and then back to the top is kind of janky
[22:25:21] <MACscr> nvm, your suggestion worked
