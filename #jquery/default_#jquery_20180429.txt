[05:14:13] <shadowswalker> hey guys, how do I loop between elements selected with $('.class-name'); I know .each(function(i, x){}) method but it gives x as a DOM element not as jquery object
[13:09:39] <jalvarez> hello
[13:10:42] <jalvarez> Im trying to access a function inside an iframe
[13:11:17] <jalvarez> I can get the iframe by getElementById but after that I cant get the function to take action
[13:18:07] <pavonia> Try $("#frameid").get(0).contentWindow.myfunc()
[19:10:33] <DavidDenver> I need a simple cross-browser, pan and zoom, with clickable html image map.  Is there anything out there like that?  Simple pixel coordinates are preferred, this isn't for a gps/long/lat based map.
[19:13:29] <DavidDenver> this doesn't seem to be a busy room, so I'll leave the client open and check in to see if anyone has posted any solutions.  thanks.
[21:43:58] <comet23> why is $ defined but jQuery is not defined?
[23:34:17] <dw1> when using arrow functions with .on events, where does 'this' go
[23:34:25] <dw1> hmm https://hackernoon.com/javascript-es6-arrow-functions-and-lexical-this-f2a3e2a5e8c4
[23:37:08] <shoky_> dw1: for events you can use event.currentTarget instead of this
[23:37:19] <shoky_> (where event is the argument to the event handler function)
[23:37:29] <dw1> cool
[23:37:46] <shoky_> or, use a regular function :p
[23:37:55] <dw1> so like e=>{ e.currentTarget }
[23:37:59] <dw1> hehe
[23:39:18] <shoky_> yea
