[00:11:00] <[E]sc> sahbeewah, thanks for your reply, they are both standalone functions, and are called separately when the page loads, but the handleTimeoutAndReset function calls the startTimer function within it as well.  i hope that helps
[00:31:24] <sahbeewah> [E]sc, I'm asking if that block of code, for instance, is perhaps inside a document.ready anonymous function or if it's just within script tags somewhere
[00:32:17] <[E]sc> sahbeewah, it's within the document.ready.
[00:33:35] <sahbeewah> then i think you'll find that window.pageRequestTime is not referencing what you think it is
[00:37:25] <[E]sc> sahbeewah, interesting,... however, i found that the startTimer within the handleTimeoutAndReset function is not being called for some reason.  Is there an error in my code or a logic concept problem?
[00:40:57] <sahbeewah> no idea, is handleTimeoutAndReset being called?
[00:41:11] <sahbeewah> is the ajax request being sent? just trace through it
[00:43:02] <sahbeewah> for the record, declaring those functions doesn't automatically call them
[00:45:27] <sahbeewah> also, functions have access to their outer function's variables, so passing those same variables as function parameters seems kind of pointless
[00:45:37] <[E]sc> sahbeewah, the handleTimeoutAndReset function is being called, and the ajax to the js.php is being sent, but not the startTimer(); after the ajax, maybe i should use a success after the ajax is returned?
[00:56:58] <sahbeewah> works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/dFtqH/

[02:56:29] <diverdude> Hello....why is the click handler not invoked for images that are appended? http://jsfiddle.net/MJ8zB/3/
[03:01:47] <[E]sc> diverdude, try placing the $('#ctrcontainer').html(++ctr); inside the click function.
[03:02:53] <diverdude> [E]sc, that makes no sense. that does not solve the problem
[03:03:11] <diverdude> [E]sc, ctr should be updated when clicked on image. not when clicked on button
[03:06:56] <[E]sc> oh i see what you want..
[03:07:09] <[E]sc> http://jsfiddle.net/9pDrH/2/ try that...but i could be wrong... i'm new at jquery
[03:08:34] <diverdude> [E]sc, mm what did you change?
[03:09:08] <diverdude> ohh you added class in on function
[03:09:15] <diverdude> nicely seen
[03:09:51] <[E]sc> yes... maybe it doesn't make sense..but it works out...
[03:10:15] <diverdude> yes you are right..thats how it works :)
[03:10:17] <diverdude> thanks
[03:11:54] <[E]sc> no problem.

[03:54:56] <spygame> hey all, i'm looking for some nice and comprehensive article about extending a jquery plugin, i would really appereciate your help
[04:07:11] <paulens> hello
[04:08:41] <paulens> is there away to manipulate the contents of a text area?
[04:08:57] <paulens> i would like to make a simple text editor with bbcode
[04:14:57] <intellilogic> I want to make this work ->  var oData=$(this).data('foo'); oData.oValidate("blablabla");    I tried:  $.fn.oValidate(string){ console.log($(this).foo + string }  //not a function.  It's looking for a selector I imagine?  So how?
[04:15:59] <intellilogic> close paran on console.log.  it's just handwritten example.
[04:17:03] <sacho> why do you want to add a function to arbitrary strings/objects?
[04:17:34] <sacho> What's wrong with OhValidate(OhData...)
[04:20:11] <intellilogic> I need to pass the string as well.  Seems more useful than oValidate(oData, "blablabla");
[04:20:40] <intellilogic> Simular to the other oData.functions I use from jQuery
[04:21:44] <sacho> "oData" is not a jquery collection.
[04:24:50] <intellilogic> so what I need is $.fn.extend
[04:40:00] <intellilogic> SomeObj.x;//3 sting="bar";  function Foo(obj, string){ console.log(obj.x); console.log(string); }  Foo(SomeObj, string);  I want to convert this to work:  SomeObj.Foo(string);  then I can say this.x...  How?
[04:47:20] <sacho> all the time you could have possibly saved typing data.validate() instead of validate(data) you've lost while asking how to do it
[04:47:40] <sacho> it just doesn't make sense to do what you want.

[07:45:30] <paulens> hello, i'm trying to get selectionStart with jquery. if i do document.getElementById("derp").selectionStart, it returns integer, but if i do $("#derp").selectionStart, it returns "undefined"

[07:53:25] <paulens> please help...
[08:02:30] <willc> So I am importing a json object via a txt file using $.getJSON("file.txt", function(data){ }); followed by $("ul#list).append($("<li />", {html: data.item}); - My problem occurs when I attempt to access $("ul#list li"); For an unknown reason I am unable to populate an array with the list items. If I use $("ul#list li").each(function(){ alert("hi!"); }); it comes up empty. All my attempts to
[08:02:30] <willc> access the <li> elements via selectors has been fruitless. Is there something I'm missing?
[08:05:59] <willc> I thought perhaps it may be a way of preventing duplicated data.
[08:08:57] <soldoutactivist> Are you trying to access ul#list in the same method that you used to create the li's?
[08:10:00] <willc> Outside of the $.getJSON()
[08:10:03] <willc> after
[08:11:51] <soldoutactivist> Immediately after the getJSON method? Or after getJSON has hit the callback?
[08:13:03] <willc> Immediately. Which makes me think I need to set it up to create and return the list upon the complete callback.
[08:13:25] <soldoutactivist> Yes, getJSON being async means ul#list is empty.
[08:14:04] <soldoutactivist> Place your jquery accessing the list in the callback.
[08:20:56] <paulens> i'm trying to get selectionStart with jquery. if i do document.getElementById("derp").selectionStart, it returns integer, but if i do $("#derp").selectionStart, it returns "undefined"
[08:21:03] <paulens> why?
[08:53:58] <paulens> hello, i'm trying to get selectionStart with jquery. if i do document.getElementById("derp").selectionStart, it returns integer, but if i do $("#derp").selectionStart, it returns "undefined". why is this happening?
[09:00:52] <joroci> paulens got a link>
[09:00:53] <joroci> ?
[09:01:07] <paulens> joroci: nope
[09:01:17] <paulens> joroci: i can paste it to jsfiddle..
[09:01:21] <joroci> k
[09:04:00] <paulens> http://jsfiddle.net/7YXmH/
[09:04:03] <paulens> joroci: ^^
[09:04:24] <paulens> i know, the button shouldn't be called "bold", lol
[09:05:37] <paulens> joroci: if i change the jquery selectors to pure javascript (getElementById), it works
[09:08:02] <soldoutactivist> $(element)[0].selectionStart
[09:08:56] <soldoutactivist> Since selectionStart is only for form inputs, I assume that jquery decided not to clutter up every other object with it.
[09:09:33] <Qdest> Been trying to implement a proper "pause on hover" on a setTimeout() I'm using. Resetting it works, just clearTimeout() and we're good. But pausing it and resuming from where it "was" is another story entirely. I've been experimenting with performance.now(), however I can't unset it. Even if I set it to undefined, next time I set it it continues from where it was o.O
[09:12:18] <paulens> soldoutactivist: thx, it works now :)
[09:12:41] <soldoutactivist> I forgot, but you might run into IE problems.
[09:12:50] <soldoutactivist> Unless you're smart and don't support it.
[09:21:02] <paulens> soldoutactivist: yes, i'm smart and don't support it. lol. if seriously, i would like it to work on IE10 at least
[09:22:03] <soldoutactivist> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff974768(v=vs.85).aspx
[09:22:09] <soldoutactivist> Looks to work IE9+
[09:23:03] <paulens> yup, that will do it :)
[09:38:37] <ColdKeyboard> I have updated my jquery to 2.0.3 and now I get error TypeError: $(...).live is not a function [in firebug] for line $('#sidebar-lista a').live('click', function(e) { ... });
[09:38:51] <ColdKeyboard> Any suggestion how I should change the live event to make it work again?
[09:41:31] <soldoutactivist> use .on
[09:41:41] <soldoutactivist> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:42:31] <Velveeta> wow, people were still using .live?
[09:48:06] <dwarder> what other things besides ajax requests and animations(i.e. slideUp) create somewhat another thread, i.e. the code after the statement continues to execute even though it is not finished yet?
[09:49:01] <Velveeta> it's not that they create another thread, it's that they're done in an asynchronous fashion using timeouts
[09:49:09] <soldoutactivist> Anything with a callback. Though threads is a bad way to reference what's going on.
[09:49:10] <Velveeta> so anything that uses a timeout of some kind to do what it does
[09:50:55] <Velveeta> and not necessarily anything with a callback, because you could pass a callback to a function that runs synchronously, and it'll just get called at the end of that function with anyt other code being called in the meantimeâ€¦ it's not a very useful pattern to write your code that way though :)
[09:51:27] <Velveeta> but anything that, in the end, runs through setTimeout or setInterval, or requestAnimationFrame
[09:51:30] <dwarder> soldoutactivist: Velveeta: is ther a hint in api that could tell me that this 'operation' will do async stuff or has a callback or a timeout
[09:51:45] <Velveeta> i don't know if there are other ones or not, but off the top of my head, those would all cause that behavior
[09:53:02] <soldoutactivist> While Velveeta is right that a method taking a callback can call that callback immediately, it is a safe bet to assume a method taking a callback will be async.
[09:53:27] <Velveeta> rightio, like i said, it's not a very useful pattern to write a synchronous function w/ a callback
[09:54:15] <soldoutactivist> Well, array.sort(sorterMethod) is something that takes a method in the callback "style" but is synchronous.
[09:55:43] <Velveeta> that's a good point, also, jquery functions like $.each
[09:56:11] <Jon47> that's not a callback function though - that's recursion
[09:56:19] <Velveeta> so we'll amend my statement to say synchronous functions that don't iterate over some kind of object, and take a callback, aren't a very useful pattern ;)
[09:56:27] <soldoutactivist> $.each isn't recursive
[09:57:01] <Jon47> well anyway, a callback is a specific subset of function parameters
[09:57:24] <Jon47> just because a method takes a function as a paramter doesn't make that fucntion a callback function
[09:57:32] <soldoutactivist> It wouldn't do to have something asynchronous that didn't have a callback, because you'd never know when it was done.
[09:58:16] <Jon47> soldoutactivist: you could use another pattern like futures/deferreds
[09:58:39] <soldoutactivist> That's just hiding how you declare the callback.
[09:59:28] <Velveeta> well, that's using a different pattern than callback functions, with the same end result
[09:59:47] <Velveeta> it helps to better organize your code so you don't end up with that sideways christmas tree of callback hell
[10:00:10] <soldoutactivist> You're not wrong. Except that you're still using callbacks.
[10:00:24] <soldoutactivist> You've only changed how you declare the callback.
[10:01:07] <Jon47> i joined halfway through the conversation - what was the original question?
[10:01:15] <Velveeta> not exactly, because a callback is specifically a function parameter to be passed for later usage by the function you're calling, whereas a deferred setup is a function you setup to be used at the time the deferred object is resolved or rejected, regardless of where it's resolved or rejected from
[10:01:25] <Velveeta> subtle difference, but they are different patterns
[10:02:11] <Velveeta> the original question was that other than things like $.ajax and some of the animation functions like slideUp, what other functions give you that asynchronous behavior of calling them and having your execution chain immediately continue
[10:02:39] <Jon47> binding event handlers
[10:02:53] <Velveeta> we threw out answers of anything that runs through setTimeout/setInterval/requestAnimationFrame, and pretty much any function that takes a callback parameter
[10:03:14] <Velveeta> and then we got sidetracked by the nuances of callback parameters in functions
[10:03:19] <soldoutactivist> It's still a callback. Promises didn't reinvent the wheel. That's what I'm saying.
[10:03:23] <soldoutactivist> Sidetracked indeed.
[10:04:32] <Velveeta> that's like saying event aggregators and mediation are the same thing, they behave similarly, but they're separate patternsâ€¦ the end goal is often the same, but that doesn't make them the same thing
[10:04:49] <soldoutactivist> It makes the underlying reaction the same. The callback.
[10:05:44] <Velveeta> so if i write 2 pieces of code, one of which uses a global variable to accomplish its task, and the other uses a local variable, but the end result is the same, would you say those 2 variables are the same type of declaration?
[10:06:09] <Velveeta> because essentially what you're saying is that a callback and a deferred object are the same type of declaration because they perform the same task in one kind of scenario
[10:07:09] <anildigital> ember vs angular?
[10:07:27] <soldoutactivist> That's a technical difference. A deferred object is just a complicated callback that can be passed around.
[10:07:57] <Jon47> a complicated object that can be used to assign new callbacks
[10:09:00] <soldoutactivist> Jon47: Yes, object, not callback. At the end of the day, some mechanism within that object says, "When this is done, call this method".
[10:09:12] <soldoutactivist> It's just encapsulating the overall async paradigm.
[10:09:44] <Jon47> yeah i agree
[10:09:48] <Jon47> i don't see the point of this discussion
[10:10:03] <soldoutactivist> I think we've gotten out our hipster dev pipes.
[10:10:13] <Velveeta> lol
[10:10:21] <Jon47> Hahaha, well carry on then
[10:10:36] <Velveeta> yes, a deferred object implements callbacks in its resolution methods, but the deferred pattern itself is not the same as the callback pattern, that's what i'm getting at
[10:10:46] <Velveeta> because a deferred can be resolved from anywhere in your code
[10:11:08] <Velveeta> whereas a callback can only be fired from the function it's passed to, or some function it in turn passes it on to
[10:13:08] <soldoutactivist> All true. But in terms of the original question: anything that can be deferred or "promised" is the same as the method accepting a callback since they are both async.
[10:13:57] <Velveeta> that much i can concede to <wraps another layer of hipster scarf around himself, completely obscuring his head from view>
[10:14:15] * soldoutactivist puffs pipe.

[11:30:04] <dotz> Hi. Guys, is it possible to get a widget when all I have is a DOM element?
[11:31:15] <rmah> a widget?
[11:32:50] <dotz> rmah, yes, first I create a widget like $("#field-1").myWidget(), then I'd like to be able to get a reference to 'myWidget' from #frame-1 selector. The deal is, I am using various widgets and I need to call .getValue method on them, but I don't know what are the types of those widgets, so I can't just call $(...).someWidget('getValue')
[11:34:08] <rmah> dotz: I actually think you can do that
[11:34:44] <dotz> rmah, cool, how? I thought about calling some .baseClass('getValue') but it looks like things don't work that way.
[11:35:37] <rmah> say you setup a spinner with $("#foo").spinner(options)
[11:35:51] <rmah> to get the value, you just do $("#foo").spinner("value")
[11:35:54] <rmah> it's that simple
[11:36:18] <rmah> jquery ui takes care of the details
[11:36:36] <yedi> is there a better way to do $($(<something>).get(any_index))
[11:37:09] <yedi> s/better/more performant or cleaner .... basically don't wanna have to rewrap the object twice
[11:37:32] <rmah> $(dom_node) is lightning fast
[11:37:38] <rmah> if that's too slow, just store it in a var
[11:59:05] <dotz> rmah, ok, cool, I got this.
[11:59:17] <dotz> rmah, my original question was, how can I get "spinner" when all I have is $("#foo")
[12:19:04] <rmah> dotz: there is no "spinner"
[12:19:49] <dotz> well, I think there is, as it gets its _create method called once and no more than once, so I guess, that there is some information about that
[12:19:53] <dotz> saved somewhere
[12:32:26] <ph88> dotz: put it in a var
[12:32:38] <dotz> ph88, no other solution, right?
[12:32:55] <ph88> it's the nicest solution of good programming imo ^^
[12:33:22] <ph88> because you directly have a memory address for lookup instead of using an algorithm to find it in a collection which you have already done before
[12:54:05] <hirsty> hey all any AJAXers in here :D or any good with $.get :P
[12:54:59] <phiz> are you taking a survey or do you have an actual question?
[12:55:12] <hirsty> yes sorry
[12:56:11] <hirsty> I have a $.get set up to compare information with that displayed into a div, only wanting to refresh the div if there is any difference in the html, but seems to be refreshing every time atm
[12:56:21] <hirsty> anyone mind lending a hand? :D
[12:57:02] <hirsty> allow me to create a fiddle
[12:57:29] <soldoutactivist> You'd be better off passing a timestamp when the content was last compiled and add that as a data- field to the div. Then just check against that timestamp.
[12:57:36] <soldoutactivist> Much easier than checking the content itself.
[12:58:29] <hirsty> thing is it is due to change on call
[12:58:51] <hirsty> as that php script then uses some functions to get the current song
[12:59:19] <soldoutactivist> Then store the song name and when it changes, change the div.
[13:00:02] <hirsty> let me show you my current setup

[13:33:22] <Xabster> Hi. I'm looking for a selector to that fills this requirement: I have elements (classes) like this: AAAAABBAAABABABBBBAAABBB where A and B are different classes. I want to select the last A in a sequence. Like, all the A's that are followed by a B, any ideas?
[13:33:56] <grafi> Xabster im not following
[13:33:56] <grafi> oÃ´
[13:37:01] <Xabster> $("#Violations_128920 .t-grouping-row + :not(.t-grouping-row)")
[13:37:42] <Xabster> that selects something. :) it selects a NOT t-grouping-row that is preceded by a t-grouping-row... but i want to select the t-grouping-row. I guess a .prev is all I need?
[13:37:44] <Velveeta> you want to find all individual a's that are followed by b's?
[13:37:49] <Xabster> yes
[13:38:00] <Velveeta> so not like a cluster of 3 a's that happen to be followed by b's
[13:38:05] <Velveeta> just the 1 a in that cluster that is
[13:38:08] <Xabster> only the last of those A's
[13:38:11] <Velveeta> gotcha
[13:38:51] <Velveeta> i can't think of a single selector that would do it, but i can think of a selector plus filter that would do it
[13:39:01] <Xabster> dont know what that is
[13:39:23] <Velveeta> $('.A').filter(function(){ return $(this).prev().hasClass('B'); });
[13:39:28] <Velveeta> er sorry
[13:39:41] <Velveeta> $('.A').filter(function(){ return $(this).next().hasClass('B'); });
[13:39:44] <Velveeta> next, not prev
[13:40:04] <Velveeta> that'll grab all A-classed items, then filter the list down to just the A's that have a next sibling with class B
[13:41:25] <Xabster> thanks, changing it a bit
[13:41:30] <Xabster> because B can be any NOT A
[13:41:59] <Xabster> so something like $('.A').filter(function(){ return !$(this).next().hasClass('A'); }); ?
[13:42:09] <Xabster> not sure about the !

[13:49:05] <odium> do I just do var string = $( document ).height()+' '+$( document ).width()
[13:57:05] <grafi> odium yes

[14:22:14] <unnu> hello #jquery
[14:22:24] <unnu> how is everyone today?
[14:24:44] <arminrosu> @Solarboom: if you're using jqui, there is a specific option for that: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-showOn
[14:24:56] <arminrosu> no need for extra event binding

[14:52:20] <TAoB> Evening Jquery. I'm having an issue if anyone is available to offer assistance.
[14:55:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> unnu: good
[14:56:31] <grafi> TAoB just ask
[14:56:59] <TAoB> I'm building a website with a fixed header that employs jquery's scroll top function to shrink the header on scroll. The site is also responsive. On the mobile view, the navigation in the header collapses to a single menu button, which when triggered, opens revealing the hidden navigation options.
[14:57:21] <TAoB> This all works fairly well. I'm experiencing some unexpected behavior however, on the mobile view. After scrolling down the navigation shrinks as it should. Once the menu button is clicked, the page will auto scroll to the top, expanding the header. once the header has fully expanded the menu options are revealed.
[14:57:38] <TAoB> Is there a way to stop the page from auto scrolling to the top and expanding the header when the mobile menu is opened?
[15:02:37] <grafi> have an example online?
[15:02:57] <unnu> Rohan_Bhangui :D
[15:05:09] <TAoB> let me toss a jfiddle together quick.
[15:09:10] <TAoB> http://jsfiddle.net/GtF3p/
[15:09:52] <TAoB> You'll have to resize the browser window to below 480px. scroll down, then click the menu button. The page will auto scroll to the top, expand the header and then open the menu.
[15:11:58] <grafi> TAoB a's with href="#" will always go to the top
[15:12:07] <grafi> TAoB http://jsfiddle.net/GtF3p/1/
[15:12:23] <grafi> TAoB i replaced the Menu a with a span
[15:12:30] <grafi> no more scrolling to top
[15:12:45] <TAoB> so simple. thank you very much grafi.
[15:12:52] <grafi> np
[15:20:58] <TAoB> grafi once the a tag is changed to a span, it will no longer open the menu.
[15:21:54] <grafi> opens just fine for me
[15:22:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> unnu: what you up to
[15:22:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> just chilling like me :D
[15:27:35] <TAoB> got it thanks.
[15:28:47] <grafi> TAoB you could possibly also set the href="#menu-toggle" so it "moves" to the menu element, which of course is already on screen so no movement is neccessary
[15:29:08] <TAoB> let me try that :)
[16:05:35] <woodcut78> poutine: 1
[16:21:32] <TAoB> I have an image gallery set up inside an ordered list. Id like to be able to click on an a thumb and expand the li to full screen. Is there a simple way to accomplish this with jquery?
[16:32:28] <safani> Hello all
[16:33:52] <safani> I have delegated a click listener to all table rows in a table.  There is also a button in this row that does something on click.  How can i stop the tr from activated my function set on delegate?
[16:38:57] <grafi> what now
[16:39:55] <grafi> hm
[17:57:41] <unnu> quick JS question: http://jsbin.com/iYemIri/2/edit says my function isn't defined?
[18:01:13] <unnu> Anyone got any ideas?
[18:01:38] <pixelpimp> unnu: don't use onclick in the markup.  attach an event listener through javascript
[18:01:48] <unnu> aight
[18:02:27] <unnu> doesn't tell me why the function isnt defined
[18:02:43] <pixelpimp> http://jsbin.com/iYemIri/3/edit
[18:03:17] <unnu> thanks man
[18:03:27] <pixelpimp> you've got some scoping issues, i'd say
[18:03:48] <pixelpimp> what's available in your onload function is not the same as what's available in your markup
[18:04:58] <pixelpimp> http://jsbin.com/iYemIri/3/ <- here, with the scope you're expecting
[18:05:10] <pixelpimp> i would not do it that way.
[18:05:40] <pixelpimp> also a lot of jquery functionality you could be using here (this is #jquery, after all...)
[18:05:51] <unnu> turst me i know
[18:06:14] <Velveeta> yeah, any function you reference within the markup like that needs to be available in the global scope
[18:10:23] <unnu> pure JS pisses me off anymore?
[18:23:07] <Jon____> Hello! Can anyone take a look at my script: http://bpaste.net/show/EhkHFMKyYVQTRY6WbK6i/
[18:23:17] <Jon____> I'm getting duplicate content once in a while and I can't figure out why
[18:41:08] <TAoB> Hey, Can someone show me how to create a div or even better a ul with a li that when clicked expands to fullscreen?
[19:08:36] <tehopeologist> hey all, how can i rotate an a link 180 degrees?
[19:08:43] <tehopeologist> it's giving me an error =/
[19:09:14] <Velveeta> rotate a link 180 degrees?
[19:09:19] <Velveeta> and what kind of error?
[19:09:34] <tehopeologist> the link has a background image
[19:09:53] <tehopeologist> so i'm trying to rotate the image 180 degrees with animation when the link's clicked
[19:10:04] <dwarder> i can use $.when with slideUp and slideDown as arguments right? it will wait till they finish and then executes .done() right?
[19:10:38] <tehopeologist> nvm i think i found it
[19:11:21] <Velveeta> dwarder: i believe so, yes, but are you trying to do those animations on the same element?
[19:11:54] <dwarder> Velveeta: nope
[19:12:01] <dwarder> Velveeta: different elements
[19:12:11] <Velveeta> so can you show an example of what you're doing?
[19:12:34] <Velveeta> like $.when(elem1.slideUp(), elem2.slideDown()).done(someCallback) ?
[19:12:51] <tehopeologist> ug i thought i had it
[19:13:09] <dwarder> Velveeta: right
[19:13:22] <Velveeta> yeah i think that should work
[19:13:27] <dwarder> Velveeta: thank you
[19:13:32] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:13:41] <tehopeologist> can you help me with this rotate thing?
[19:13:59] <Velveeta> tehopeologist if you can show us an example of what you're trying to do, sur
[19:14:00] <Velveeta> e
[19:14:07] <tehopeologist> sure lemme see if i can whip something up
[19:16:06] <tehopeologist> so i have this
[19:16:07] <tehopeologist> http://jsfiddle.net/8FjCR/
[19:16:14] <tehopeologist> well
[19:16:18] <tehopeologist> let me put something in place instead
[19:16:19] <tehopeologist> sec
[19:17:32] <tehopeologist> here
[19:17:32] <tehopeologist> http://jsfiddle.net/8FjCR/1/
[19:17:36] <tehopeologist> that's how i have this link setup
[19:17:44] <tehopeologist> just used a placeholder image instead of what i'm actually using
[19:17:53] <tehopeologist> i basically need that image to rotate when clicked
[19:18:06] <tehopeologist> so a toggle rotate from normal and 180 degrees
[19:19:31] <tehopeologist> now trying to add rotate: http://jsfiddle.net/8FjCR/2/
[19:19:34] <tehopeologist> and it doesn't work =/
[19:21:31] <Velveeta> tehopeologist: http://jsfiddle.net/8FjCR/6/
[19:21:46] <Velveeta> there's an example with 90deg
[19:21:55] <tehopeologist> ahhhhh
[19:21:58] <tehopeologist> so use css to rotate
[19:22:02] <Velveeta> yep
[19:22:03] <tehopeologist> and just apply that to a toggle class
[19:22:06] <tehopeologist> beautiful
[19:22:11] <tehopeologist> thank you <33
[19:22:19] <Velveeta> you'll need to use different prefixes for different browsers of course
[19:22:37] <Velveeta> and the ms version doesn't take a degree value, it takes 0-3 for 90deg increments i believe
[19:22:53] <tehopeologist> okay thanks for the heads up
[19:22:57] <Velveeta> so it'll depend on what kind of browser support you need
[19:22:59] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:24:48] <TAoB> Can someone show me how to create a div or even better a ul with a li that when clicked expands to fullscreen?
[19:38:13] <Goopyo> whats the last jquery thats compatible with the old IE?
[19:38:53] <pixelpimp> 1.10.2
[19:39:04] <Goopyo> appreciated
[19:39:18] <Goopyo> any major benefits of using a newer one?
[19:39:23] <pixelpimp> no old IE support
[19:39:39] <Goopyo> hah
[19:44:22] <Velveeta> is the AMD-ification only gonna be done to the 2.x branch, does anybody know?
[19:46:51] <soldoutactivist> "no old IE support" means the filesize decreases a good percentage.
[19:48:40] <soldoutactivist> Okay, so good is only 9%. 93k to 84k. But still.
[19:49:06] <pixelpimp> surprised it's that little :(
[19:51:55] <soldoutactivist> Velveeta: It looks like AMD will move forward on both branches.
[19:52:21] <Velveeta> suh-weet!
[19:52:42] <thebigkiwi> what's the best way to debug 'undefined' errors?
[19:53:09] <Velveeta> i typically click through to the line in question and set a conditional breakpoint for when varname === undefined
[19:53:22] <Velveeta> and then when that gets triggered, check the call stack to see where it's coming from
[19:53:40] <soldoutactivist> thebigkiwi: Velveeta: Or you could just add debugger; to the top of your method.
[19:53:59] <thebigkiwi> Ok, i have > 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'j("#nivoslider-48").nivoSlider')
[19:54:01] <Velveeta> true, but the bulk of the undefined errors i encounter are deep in the bowels of jquery itself
[19:54:09] <Velveeta> from some weird call that was passed down the stack
[19:54:26] <thebigkiwi> tried no.conflict mode but that didnt help
[19:54:35] <soldoutactivist> Velveeta: thebigkiwi should have some idea where the undefined error came from.
[19:55:17] <thebigkiwi> soldoutactivist: Velveeta: yeah its from the Nivo Slider plugin, jQuery is defined before the code is launched as well
[19:56:10] <soldoutactivist> If the undefined throws an uncaught error, you can look at the trace stack. That is, if your plugin isn't in a minified package, otherwise...
[19:56:10] <Velveeta> also, 'debugger' will catch everytime it runs through the code block in question, which, depending on the nature of the function, could be a dozen times or more before an undefined error runs through it, that's why i prefer conditional breakpoints ;)
[19:56:38] <thebigkiwi> stack: "eval codeâ†µeval@[native code]â†µ_evaluateOnâ†µ_evaluateAndWrapâ†µevaluate"
[19:56:50] <soldoutactivist> Are you using eval?
[19:57:05] <thebigkiwi> thats just what the console is telling me about the error
[19:57:25] <soldoutactivist> What browser are you using?
[19:57:26] <thebigkiwi> pretty much out of my depth here
[19:57:28] <thebigkiwi> using safari
[19:57:43] <thebigkiwi> site > http://photos.vmusic.com.au
[19:57:49] <soldoutactivist> Try it in chrome, which prints a sane and actual stack.
[19:57:52] <thebigkiwi> ok
[19:58:17] <Velveeta> how do you recreate the error on there?
[19:58:30] <thebigkiwi> wait for the page to load, the top image should be a slider
[19:59:03] <thebigkiwi> not sure when it stopped working, client emailed me this morning pissed off
[19:59:05] <soldoutactivist> The error is that you don't wait for nivoSlider to load.
[19:59:35] <Velveeta> yeah, you're using window.load vs document.ready
[19:59:43] <thebigkiwi> oh ok, ill change that
[20:00:46] <thebigkiwi> damn that didnt fix it
[20:01:26] <thebigkiwi> this is what im getting now as an error in chrome >> https://gist.github.com/chillybin/c1b0ce82937eec1fce04
[20:01:41] <soldoutactivist> thebigkiwi put the js for the nivo plugin after jquery
[20:01:55] <soldoutactivist> The nivo plugin is called before jquery when jquery doesn't exist.
[20:02:17] <thebigkiwi> really? ok, ill pop it in the footer, i thought it came after when i checked
[20:02:48] <soldoutactivist> I'm sorry, I'm stupid skimming, that was the css file.
[20:02:59] <soldoutactivist> I don't see the nivo script being called at all.
[20:03:18] <soldoutactivist> Unless its rolled into another js script.
[20:03:33] <thebigkiwi> wow, youre right what a stupid plugin
[20:03:45] <thebigkiwi> it calls the css
[20:04:53] <soldoutactivist> I bet money--not a lot--that the wordpress version was updated recently? And the plugin calls a hook to inject the javascript that it shouldn't.
[20:05:18] <soldoutactivist> Obviously, you didn't let this go to the client not working.
[20:05:30] <soldoutactivist> So if something was going to change, it's probably wordpress itself.
[20:05:32] <thebigkiwi> i actually thing its got an auto code to only use the wordpress editor, but ive coded this in php
[20:05:53] <thebigkiwi> <?php echo do_shortcode('[nivoslider slug="homepage"]'); ?>
[20:06:11] <thebigkiwi> so some how its not including jquery when i use the manual shortcode like that
[20:07:07] <soldoutactivist> Ah, the fun of wordpress plugins.
[20:07:19] <thebigkiwi> yeah, paid money for this too, basterds
[20:13:26] <thebigkiwi> fixed it now  thanks
[20:14:13] <adamsilver> Why I am unable to manipulate html elements using jquery after loading them via pjax (https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax)?
[20:24:43] <adamsilver> what is the replacement of .live()?
[20:24:59] <adamsilver> I see it was deprecated
[20:25:37] <soldoutactivist> on
[20:26:39] <Goopyo> how do you submit a form normally after you do js to it?
[20:27:02] <Goopyo> nvm
[20:28:01] <dwarder> is there a notion of first index in an abject?
[20:28:16] <Velveeta> nope
[20:28:21] <dwarder> as if i did for(var index in object){}
[20:28:36] <Velveeta> the way the browser implements the order of properties on an object to iterate over is browser-dependent
[20:28:52] <dwarder> Velveeta: that is ok for me
[20:28:56] <Velveeta> some will iterate over them in the order they were created, others will sort them logically
[20:32:06] <rmah> anyone ever use dropzone?
[20:32:20] <rmah> I get an "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined" in the browser
[20:32:34] <rmah> but googleing shows that this error only occurs if you use it server-side
[20:32:48] <Velveeta> if you use what server side?
[20:33:12] <rmah> perl.  but it's not supposed to matter
[20:33:31] <Velveeta> require has nothing to do with perl
[20:33:34] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone know how I can have an event be listened for in another file?
[20:33:45] <rmah> Velveeta: that's what I said
[20:33:46] <LoneSoldier728> i am trying to have it vent.on in one file
[20:33:49] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: you'll ahve to be more explicit than that
[20:33:49] <rmah> this is in the browser
[20:33:50] <LoneSoldier728> and vent.trigger in another
[20:34:04] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19626706/how-to-connect-an-event-from-different-files-javascript-backbone
[20:34:10] <LoneSoldier728> that is the question posted on SO
[20:34:22] <Velveeta> rmah: right, so what do you mean googling showed that an undefined error for require only shows it should be a factor if you're using perl on the server? the 2 have absolutely nothing to do with each other
[20:34:28] <Velveeta> they're not even the same language
[20:34:29] <LoneSoldier728> basically I am calling var vent and extending the events
[20:34:37] <LoneSoldier728> so it has trigger and on as proto
[20:34:40] <rmah> Velveeta: that's my point
[20:34:53] <Velveeta> you haven't made a point yet.. i'm trying to figure out your point...
[20:35:03] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to then call vent.trigger on one file and I want it to be listened to on another (vent.on)
[20:35:03] <rmah> 1) I get an "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined" in the browser
[20:35:12] <Velveeta> if you're getting an error about require being undefined, it's because you're not including require.js in your page
[20:35:16] <LoneSoldier728> so I can print it out on the console... seem
[20:35:21] <rmah> 2) when I google, the only reference to that error is about when dropzone is used server-side with node.js
[20:35:25] <rmah> but I'm not
[20:35:30] <rmah> I'm using it as normal on the client
[20:35:35] <rmah> hence my confusion
[20:35:37] <LoneSoldier728> velveeta are you referring to me?
[20:35:47] <LoneSoldier728> oh he used require too
[20:35:53] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: i'm bouncing back and forth between both of you, but that last one was for rmah
[20:36:15] <LoneSoldier728> rmah what is ur issue? maybe i can help
[20:36:18] <rmah> Velveeta: it's not supposed to be necessary
[20:36:21] <LoneSoldier728> I have been working with require
[20:36:36] <rmah> LoneSoldier728: I'm trying to use dropzone.js
[20:36:55] <rmah> the docs say, "add this <script src="/js/dropzone.js"></script>"
[20:37:06] <rmah> and then add a <form> with class of "dropzone"
[20:37:14] <rmah> and the appropriate action path, of course
[20:37:19] <Goopyo> if I add an element with jquery and want t detect a click on it later I have to do .on on it right?
[20:37:20] <rmah> and it should "just work"
[20:37:29] <LoneSoldier728> oh cool, yeah havent used it yet
[20:37:52] <rmah> it seems to fail on this line: Em = typeof Emitter !== "undefined" && Emitter !== null ? Emitter : require("emitter");
[20:38:09] <rmah> Emitter is not defined anywhere in dropzone.js
[20:38:12] <rmah> any idea what it is?
[20:38:21] <Velveeta> so it's trying to use require.js, which you don't have loaded
[20:38:34] <Velveeta> emitter is a node module, Event.Emitter
[20:38:40] <LoneSoldier728> so ya any light on my situation : )
[20:39:10] <rmah> ah, fixed it
[20:39:16] <rmah> I included the pre-build .js
[20:39:18] <rmah> god dammit
[20:40:05] <Goopyo> if I add an element with jquery and want t detect a click on it later I have to do .on on it right?
[20:40:32] <soldoutactivist> Yes.
[20:40:35] <LoneSoldier728> ya goopyo
[20:40:43] <Velveeta> hold on, watching the end of walking dead
[20:40:57] <LoneSoldier728> ha nice, ive been missing it
[20:41:04] <Velveeta> ok, commercial
[20:41:05] <Goopyo> weird wont reach console log for me
[20:41:11] <Velveeta> let me read that SO page you linked
[20:41:33] <Goopyo> http://pastebin.com/8QXPk9DJ
[20:41:59] <Goopyo> want to detect clicks on element added in line 6 on line 20
[20:42:44] <LoneSoldier728> kk thanks
[20:43:04] <LoneSoldier728> Goopyo then do .on
[20:43:25] <Goopyo> I did, did you check out line 20?
[20:43:26] <LoneSoldier728> oh you have it in line 20
[20:43:35] <LoneSoldier728> is there a problem
[20:43:36] <LoneSoldier728> with it?
[20:43:37] <Goopyo> console wont log with a semicolon
[20:43:42] <Goopyo> forgot it in the paste
[20:44:06] <LoneSoldier728> what issue are you having goopyo
[20:44:16] <Goopyo> The on event isn't binding
[20:44:32] <Goopyo> clicking on the button wont console.log('yo')
[20:45:13] <Velveeta> does .remove-addon exist at the time document.ready is fired?
[20:45:27] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: i'm still trying to figure out exactly what's trying to be accomplished in that SO link
[20:45:39] <Goopyo> no thats what I'm saying, I'm adding it after on line 6
[20:45:51] <Goopyo> after document is ready
[20:46:04] <LoneSoldier728> it is working for me
[20:46:07] <Velveeta> goopyo: then you're getting an empty jquery set to bind that listener to during document.ready, you need to bind it higher
[20:46:10] <Velveeta> in the dom
[20:46:10] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/yK8tH/
[20:46:15] <LoneSoldier728> goopyo check that out
[20:46:27] <LoneSoldier728> so velveeta
[20:46:28] <Velveeta> do something like this: $(document).on('click', '.remove-addon', function () {
[20:46:45] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to change pages ultimately
[20:46:53] <LoneSoldier728> based on a success trigger
[20:47:06] <LoneSoldier728> but since they are separate files using require.js
[20:47:14] <LoneSoldier728> another file has to listen to it be triggered
[20:47:22] <LoneSoldier728> so it knows to remove the view and render a new one
[20:47:25] <Goopyo> Velveeta: I thought the main purspose of on (ex live) was to detect dom changes after document ready?
[20:47:57] <LoneSoldier728> well .on should only be affected if the click is done... so it might be something else
[20:48:02] <Goopyo> Although that worked
[20:48:06] <Velveeta> goopyo: on isn't the ex-live function, it's a combination of the ex-bind/delegate/live functions
[20:48:06] <LoneSoldier728> in ur code since the js fiddle works correctly
[20:48:15] <Velveeta> it behaves differently depending on the parameters you pass to it
[20:48:39] <Goopyo> gotcha. Appreciate the help guys
[20:48:41] <Velveeta> using $(document).on(event, selector, callback) simulates the old live functionality
[20:49:38] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: so, i'm not positive that i'm reading this properly, but it doesn't look like you're properly creating vent
[20:49:44] <Velveeta> or else it doesn't look like you're using it properly
[20:49:58] <LoneSoldier728> yeah it is possible, i am unaware of that part
[20:50:18] <LoneSoldier728> am i including it wrong?
[20:50:25] <Velveeta> you're creating it as a Backbone.Events object, but assigning a listener and a trigger function to it like if it was a dom node
[20:50:36] <Velveeta> what exactly is 'vent' symbolic of?
[20:50:43] <LoneSoldier728> an event
[20:50:49] <LoneSoldier728> that occurs
[20:50:57] <LoneSoldier728> so when vent triggers netPage
[20:51:01] <LoneSoldier728> nextPage*
[20:51:07] <LoneSoldier728> I want in to print to the console
[20:51:24] <LoneSoldier728> when doing console.log(vent)
[20:51:32] <Velveeta> oh wait i see what's going on now
[20:51:34] <LoneSoldier728> I do have the methods on, trigger, etc... available
[20:51:47] <Velveeta> so what you're saying is that the page is changing properly, but it's not hitting your console.log output?
[20:52:04] <LoneSoldier728> it doesnt change right now... let me explain the whole thing
[20:52:11] <Velveeta> well, before you do
[20:52:22] <Velveeta> let me explain to you one reason it won't work regardless, the way it's currently written
[20:52:27] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[20:52:35] <Velveeta> you're defining 'vent' in both modules, but they're not representative of the same object
[20:52:41] <Velveeta> they just happen to have the same name
[20:52:45] <LoneSoldier728> aha ok
[20:52:48] <Velveeta> so whatever you do to one won't be reflected in the other
[20:52:54] <Velveeta> you need to do what's called dependency injection
[20:53:06] <Velveeta> meaning you declare that variable in one place, and then pass it into the other to be used there
[20:53:14] <LoneSoldier728> i tried doing that originally
[20:53:17] <Velveeta> typically, you do that from some parent module
[20:53:22] <LoneSoldier728> as you can see i pass it in after the model
[20:54:00] <Velveeta> right, i do see that
[20:54:03] <LoneSoldier728> i think i actually can call it by
[20:54:04] <LoneSoldier728> this.vent
[20:54:07] <Velveeta> but you're still declaring it in the other module
[20:54:08] <LoneSoldier728> i tried just vent
[20:54:13] <Velveeta> yes, this.vent would work for that
[20:54:16] <LoneSoldier728> ya that was before i declared it
[20:54:28] <LoneSoldier728> let me try thanks
[20:54:28] <Velveeta> gotcha
[20:54:33] <Velveeta> no problem, that *should* work
[20:54:40] <LoneSoldier728> right moment of truth
[20:55:26] <LoneSoldier728> hm saying undefined ah
[20:56:11] <LoneSoldier728> i dont see it available
[20:56:15] <LoneSoldier728> in teh proto either
[20:56:28] <Velveeta> try receiving it in your initialize function in that module
[20:56:36] <Velveeta> and explicitly assigning it to this.vent or something
[20:56:46] <LoneSoldier728> in the search view?
[20:56:54] <Velveeta> yep
[20:57:18] <LoneSoldier728> so instead of trigerring it in the nextPage function
[20:57:26] <LoneSoldier728> trigger it in the intialize you are saying?
[20:58:08] <LoneSoldier728> undefined right away
[20:58:11] <Velveeta> actually, nevermind, because the backbone constructors should automatically take care of that assignment for you i would think
[20:58:11] <LoneSoldier728> in the initialize
[20:58:39] <Velveeta> if you add a function called initialize, and receive a parameter called options, then console.log that object
[20:58:51] <Velveeta> see if it contains a model and a vent property on it
[20:59:11] <LoneSoldier728> aha
[20:59:17] <LoneSoldier728> ya options
[20:59:21] <LoneSoldier728> has the
[20:59:27] <Velveeta> the initialize function should automatically be invoked by backbone
[20:59:28] <LoneSoldier728> vent obj
[20:59:33] <LoneSoldier728> ya it is
[20:59:43] <Velveeta> ok, then from your initialize function, assign something like: this.vent = options.vent;
[20:59:53] <LoneSoldier728> ok i have that set
[20:59:55] <LoneSoldier728> already
[20:59:57] <Velveeta> i would think backbone would automatically set up vent as a property of 'this', but maybe not
[21:00:22] <LoneSoldier728> ya i thought that as well
[21:00:42] <LoneSoldier728> so should I be able to call
[21:00:44] <LoneSoldier728> options.vent
[21:00:47] <LoneSoldier728> .trigger
[21:00:47] <b-ot> LoneSoldier728: broadcasting an event out
[21:01:15] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[21:01:22] <LoneSoldier728> how do i pass it from the intialize
[21:02:14] <Velveeta> i just told you, within initialize, set this.vent = options.vent
[21:02:23] <Velveeta> and then from anywhere else, you can call this.vent.whatever
[21:02:41] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/agUTcYSS
[21:02:43] <LoneSoldier728> i did
[21:03:08] <Velveeta> why are you triggering nextPage from your init function?
[21:03:13] <LoneSoldier728> just to see
[21:03:15] <LoneSoldier728> if it prints
[21:03:17] <Velveeta> oh
[21:03:21] <LoneSoldier728> and it isnt
[21:03:22] <LoneSoldier728> working
[21:03:53] <Velveeta> well that's because it's triggering before you bind its listener
[21:04:09] <Velveeta> that's being run the instant you create your view object, which is 3 lines before you bind the nextPage listener
[21:05:03] <LoneSoldier728> should i be able to call it in the nextPage function like this ----- options.vent.trigger('nextPage')
[21:05:16] <Velveeta> no, this.vent.trigger
[21:05:27] <Velveeta> that's why you're assigning it to this.vent
[21:06:14] <LoneSoldier728> ya says it is undefined
[21:06:46] <Velveeta> put up a new paste somewhere
[21:08:07] <nardev> i want to select each group of radio buttons and go through group with each however this what i have now goes trough each radio button individually, this is what i have: $(".box:visible input[name^='group']").each
[21:08:09] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/vi7ezkxj
[21:08:09] <LoneSoldier728> there
[21:09:50] <Velveeta> try using your _this variable
[21:09:55] <Velveeta> _this.vent.trigger
[21:10:29] <Velveeta> you should try to maintain proper scope throughout your functions, but without taking the time to walk you through doing that in this instance, since you're using _this everywhere else, i'd say use it here too
[21:10:56] <Velveeta> and you can probably scrap the initialize function when you're done with that, if that works
[21:10:57] <LoneSoldier728> i did try that originally
[21:11:14] <LoneSoldier728> on the first this inside my search function tho
[21:11:18] <LoneSoldier728> I do have the vent object
[21:11:25] <LoneSoldier728> so i am not sure why it is lost
[21:11:35] <LoneSoldier728> down the chain let me see if _this
[21:11:42] <LoneSoldier728> in the search fucntion has it
[21:11:48] <Velveeta> oh yeah, that's why
[21:11:56] <Velveeta> i didn't notice it was wrapped inside the search function
[21:12:05] <Velveeta> if you're gonna use that, it should be outside your search function
[21:12:21] <Velveeta> or else redeclared within each function you're gonna use it
[21:12:53] <LoneSoldier728> ya i have it passed in
[21:13:02] <LoneSoldier728> should i declare
[21:13:06] <LoneSoldier728> this outside ?
[21:13:18] <Velveeta> passed in from where?
[21:13:34] <Velveeta> this line doesn't pass it in: _this.model.save({music: response}, {success: _this.nextPage});
[21:13:35] <LoneSoldier728> well
[21:13:38] <LoneSoldier728> that is actually useless
[21:13:42] <Velveeta> and that's where you're calling your nextPage function from
[21:13:50] <LoneSoldier728> it is just this.model
[21:13:57] <Velveeta> what you should really be doing is calling it like this:
[21:14:09] <Velveeta> _this.model.save({music: response}, {success: $.proxy(_this.nextPage, _this)});
[21:14:21] <Velveeta> and then within nextPage you can just use 'this' instead of _this
[21:15:18] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[21:15:27] <LoneSoldier728> that makes sense
[21:15:31] <LoneSoldier728> and I realized
[21:15:43] <LoneSoldier728> passing _this in the nextPage function is actually this.model
[21:15:47] <LoneSoldier728> thats why there is a problem
[21:16:52] <Velveeta> well, technically, '_this' shouldn't exist inside your saveToLocalStorage function
[21:16:57] <Velveeta> because it's defined in your search function
[21:16:58] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[21:17:05] <Velveeta> you should be using just 'this' in all of those functions
[21:17:32] <Velveeta> and anywhere you're passing one as a callback, like in the case of this.nextPage being passed as a success callback, you need to wrap it in a $.proxy call to maintain the proper scope of 'this'
[21:17:32] <LoneSoldier728> I was doing it so the this was not lost
[21:17:52] <LoneSoldier728> wat is $.proxy
[21:18:09] <Velveeta> it's a function that returns a properly-scoped version of a function, using the scope you supply
[21:18:21] <LoneSoldier728> and if I try to pass in saveToLocalStorage sucess: _this.nextPage, _this I get an error btw
[21:18:23] <Velveeta> $.proxy(this.nextPage, this) returns a function that executes this.nextPage with the scope of 'this'
[21:18:35] <Velveeta> because you didn't do it like i said
[21:18:40] <Velveeta> you're not using $.proxy
[21:18:45] <Velveeta> re-read what i'd posted up there
[21:18:48] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[21:18:54] <gregf_> hello
[21:18:55] <LoneSoldier728> ah
[21:19:03] <LoneSoldier728> didnt notice that
[21:19:58] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[21:20:10] <LoneSoldier728> i guess i can see where this is in scope too and change it
[21:20:20] <LoneSoldier728> so now it does not error
[21:20:28] <LoneSoldier728> but the router file is not picking it up?
[21:20:45] <Velveeta> is there a place i can see this in action live?
[21:20:54] <Velveeta> instead of having you repost another paste every 30 seconds?
[21:21:35] <LoneSoldier728> ya i know
[21:21:37] <LoneSoldier728> unfortunately not
[21:21:42] <LoneSoldier728> but i can paste bin it : /
[21:21:52] <Velveeta> ok
[21:22:01] <Velveeta> i'm heading to bed in about 5 minutes btw
[21:22:08] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/hJkdZmZj
[21:22:22] <LoneSoldier728> kk sorry ya, any min left can help
[21:22:27] <LoneSoldier728> so the top is the router
[21:22:31] <LoneSoldier728> it did not change
[21:22:40] <Velveeta> right
[21:22:49] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/vi7ezkxj
[21:22:51] <LoneSoldier728> same as that
[21:23:24] <LoneSoldier728> just added the $proxy to the code in the pastebin i just re-entered here
[21:23:25] <Velveeta> so i still say your _this shouldn't be initialized properly, since it's undeclared in saveToLocalStorage
[21:23:46] <Velveeta> oh wait
[21:23:50] <Velveeta> i see, you're passing it in as a parameter
[21:24:19] <LoneSoldier728> it does work
[21:24:24] <LoneSoldier728> btw on tthe same page
[21:24:27] <LoneSoldier728> i added this line
[21:24:29] <LoneSoldier728> after the trigger
[21:24:31] <Velveeta> ok, so here's another problem
[21:24:36] <LoneSoldier728> this.vent.on('nextPage', console.log('trigged'));
[21:24:40] <Velveeta> {success: storeMusic })
[21:24:43] <LoneSoldier728> and on trigger
[21:24:47] <Velveeta> in your search function
[21:24:51] <LoneSoldier728> it does display to the console
[21:25:00] <LoneSoldier728> it just has to be picked up in the router
[21:25:10] <Velveeta> you need to wrap that in a $.proxy call also
[21:25:15] <Velveeta> you're still losing scope
[21:25:34] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/zpZsaz9q
[21:26:04] <LoneSoldier728> well storeMusic is an actualy function within the search function
[21:26:06] <Velveeta> that *shouldn't* work, but you're saying it does?
[21:26:15] <mintmoney> can anyone tell me a method to parse some data from the callback url get request by inputs.io for a successful payment?? https://inputs.io/api
[21:26:22] <Velveeta> ok, it's hard to tell with the way the indentation is in here
[21:26:25] <LoneSoldier728> ya sorry
[21:26:45] <LoneSoldier728> i know i had that problem, and I can do what you said but I just made my piece with it to keep it in scope
[21:26:53] <LoneSoldier728> everything works good now even the trigger
[21:26:57] <LoneSoldier728> but just need the router file
[21:27:01] <LoneSoldier728> to listen to the change
[21:27:11] <LoneSoldier728> because the trigger and on function works
[21:27:13] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/zpZsaz9q
[21:27:17] <Velveeta> well what you need to do is spend some time refactoring all of this properly to maintain scope from top to bottom
[21:27:24] <LoneSoldier728> ya i will
[21:27:31] <LoneSoldier728> i just want to get it to be functional
[21:27:36] <Velveeta> until then, i'm sure you're losing scope somewhere and this.vent is not referencing the same object depending on what function you're in
[21:27:49] <Velveeta> i'm saying that in order to get it to be functional, you need to refactor it to maintain scope properly
[21:28:11] <LoneSoldier728> well the this in nextPage is the same this
[21:28:14] <LoneSoldier728> in search
[21:28:28] <Velveeta> you have some cases now where you have a private function inheriting scope through its closure, other cases where you're passing scope in as a parameter, and now a 3rd case where you're calling a function with its scope via $.proxy
[21:28:41] <LoneSoldier728> ya i know its messy lol
[21:28:53] <Velveeta> i know, and i'm saying that in order to get this working properly, you need to clean all that up
[21:29:13] <LoneSoldier728> ok so just doing
[21:29:20] <LoneSoldier728> this on everything should work technically right?
[21:29:23] <LoneSoldier728> without passing it in
[21:29:26] <LoneSoldier728> or calling proxy?
[21:29:48] <Velveeta> first, i would move storeMusic out of search, there's no reason for it to be in there
[21:29:49] <LoneSoldier728> i can just console it and see if it is
[21:29:59] <Velveeta> then use 'this' in all of your functions
[21:30:11] <LoneSoldier728> the problem i had with storeMusic
[21:30:15] <Velveeta> and anywhere you're passing a function as a callback to another function, you need to wrap it in a proxy call
[21:30:43] <LoneSoldier728> so storeMusic
[21:30:47] <LoneSoldier728> has to be in a proxy call
[21:30:51] <LoneSoldier728> in the search function then
[21:30:54] <LoneSoldier728> in the callback
[21:30:55] <Velveeta> yes
[21:30:55] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[21:31:00] <LoneSoldier728> easy fix then
[21:31:08] <Velveeta> and you would call it as $.proxy(this.storeMusic, this)
[21:31:08] <LoneSoldier728> and
[21:31:19] <LoneSoldier728> do i just passs this
[21:31:19] <LoneSoldier728> k
[21:31:20] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[21:31:39] <Velveeta> you pass 'this' to the proxy function, yes, but not as a parameter to the storeMusic function itself
[21:31:45] <Velveeta> like you have 'that' as a parameter, get rid of that
[21:31:55] <LoneSoldier728> is there a way to do that outside of jquery just wondering
[21:32:04] <LoneSoldier728> i am going to use the jquery version but saying is it hard
[21:32:06] <LoneSoldier728> without it
[21:32:15] <Velveeta> it's not hard, no
[21:32:28] <Velveeta> you could also do something like this:
[21:32:41] <LoneSoldier728> if i call from storeMusic
[21:32:47] <LoneSoldier728> this.anotherFunction
[21:32:51] <LoneSoldier728> should I be passing
[21:32:53] <LoneSoldier728> this in it as well
[21:33:00] <LoneSoldier728> _this.clearLocalStorage(_this);
[21:33:04] <LoneSoldier728> i was doing that originally
[21:33:05] <Velveeta> nope
[21:33:14] <LoneSoldier728> so it should maintain scope
[21:33:15] <Velveeta> if you're calling the function directly, there's no need to pass the scope
[21:33:38] <Velveeta> but when you pass it asynchronously, as a callback to another function, then when that function later executes it, it doesn't have the original scope available anymore
[21:33:49] <Velveeta> so you have to pass that scope along w/ the function so that it can be executed later with that scope
[21:34:54] <LoneSoldier728> great
[21:34:55] <LoneSoldier728> fixed it
[21:35:03] <Velveeta> and is it actually working?
[21:35:08] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/J56Qkvbd
[21:35:09] <LoneSoldier728> yep
[21:35:12] <Velveeta> sweet
[21:35:17] <LoneSoldier728> so now
[21:35:24] <Velveeta> now, try removing the initialize function
[21:35:41] <Velveeta> you shouldn't need it, backbone should automatically assign 'vent' to the local object scope when you pass it in the way you're passing it in
[21:35:50] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[21:35:51] <LoneSoldier728> let me see
[21:35:59] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[21:36:00] <LoneSoldier728> nope
[21:36:03] <LoneSoldier728> its erroring
[21:36:19] <Velveeta> new paste?
[21:36:26] <LoneSoldier728> without it
[21:36:30] <LoneSoldier728> the this has no vent
[21:36:32] <LoneSoldier728> object
[21:36:50] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/XazB0auX
[21:36:51] <Velveeta> alrighty then, i guess put it back, i could have sworn it would do that part automatically
[21:37:09] <LoneSoldier728> me to, because i have the model passed in
[21:37:15] <LoneSoldier728> and it works fine with this.model
[21:37:47] <Velveeta> aha! i found it
[21:37:51] <Mrgoose2> Do you all still experience transition flicker in jquery mobile 1.4 beta?
[21:37:54] <Mrgoose2> oops
[21:37:59] <LoneSoldier728> it might be be because
[21:38:00] <Velveeta> it *will* automatically assign them, but you have to reference it as this.options.vent
[21:38:15] <LoneSoldier728> aha
[21:38:17] <LoneSoldier728> correct
[21:38:18] <gregf_> hi, i'm creating select box programmatically and setting an onchange event , but when i change the selectbox option the function does not get called at all on ie8
[21:38:19] <LoneSoldier728> it is in the options
[21:38:22] <Velveeta> looks like standard properties are merged that way, and nonstandard properties are left on the options object
[21:38:29] <nardev> why does this goes through the list based on number of radio buttons rather than based on number of groups OF radion buttons. "$('input[name^="group"]:radio').each(function(index){ console.log(index +": "+$(this).attr("name"));});"
[21:38:32] <Velveeta> so this.model is valid because that's a standard property
[21:38:41] <Velveeta> but this.vent isn't standard, so you have to reference it as this.options.vent
[21:38:44] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[21:38:47] <LoneSoldier728> great it works on this end
[21:38:52] <LoneSoldier728> let me see if it works
[21:38:54] <LoneSoldier728> on the router
[21:39:01] <LoneSoldier728> well
[21:39:10] <LoneSoldier728> on the router actually i have it being called as vent.on
[21:39:20] <Velveeta> well on the router that's fine
[21:39:23] <Velveeta> you're creating it there
[21:39:28] <Velveeta> i'm talking about within the view
[21:39:39] <LoneSoldier728> ya kk
[21:39:46] <LoneSoldier728> it works now on the view without the initialize
[21:39:52] <Velveeta> sweet
[21:39:58] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/f2rkN7An
[21:40:00] <LoneSoldier728> so now
[21:40:05] <LoneSoldier728> I need the router to pick it up
[21:40:20] <Velveeta> it's still not?
[21:40:20] <LoneSoldier728> and i am havint it just print to the console which it is not doing
[21:40:50] <LoneSoldier728> well
[21:40:52] <Velveeta> the console.log in your nextPage function, is it outputting 'trigged' properly?
[21:40:55] <LoneSoldier728> if in the vent.on function
[21:41:01] <LoneSoldier728> I do this in the router file
[21:41:05] <LoneSoldier728> vent.on('nextPage', console.log('printT'));
[21:41:13] <Velveeta> on that won't work
[21:41:14] <LoneSoldier728> it calls printT
[21:41:16] <LoneSoldier728> before
[21:41:32] <Velveeta> you need to wrap that in a function wrapper
[21:41:42] <LoneSoldier728> vent.on('nextPage', this.printCons, this);
[21:41:44] <Velveeta> .on expects a function for a callback, what you're passing it is the return of a function
[21:41:49] <LoneSoldier728> i tried that which is in the original
[21:42:09] <LoneSoldier728> printCons being a function that just has a console.log in it

[21:42:30] <Velveeta> in the original you should just be calling vent.on('nextPage', printCons)
[21:42:57] <LoneSoldier728> perfect!
[21:43:03] <LoneSoldier728> thanks

[21:45:04] <nardev> why does this selector goes through each radio button instead just to loop as much as there is different groups? http://jsfiddle.net/nardev/3AsCm/2/
