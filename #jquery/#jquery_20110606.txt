[00:00:04] <babonk> Is there a way to fadeIn some html without referencing an id?  like $("#myElement").append("a").fadeIn()?
[00:00:22] <Rahly> i find, json to be faster though, easy to decode and use php/js/perl;
[00:00:31] <juha____> babonk: well, you need selector
[00:00:53] <juha____> babonk: how else jquery is going to know what element to fadein? but it doesn't have to be id, can be anything ;)
[00:01:01] <Rahly> append the letter a?
[00:01:11] <Rahly> thats kinda weird
[00:01:21] <babonk> well not a
[00:01:28] <babonk> but rather <li><span>...</span></li>
[00:01:34] <babonk> a was placeholder
[00:02:31] <JKarsrud> babonk: what do mean not reference an id?
[00:03:09] <JKarsrud> Your selector can reference any kind of element, it doesn't have to be selected with an id, it can be class, pseudo element selectors or attribute selectors
[00:03:33] <Rahly> wish jquery had a shortcut to document.createElement
[00:03:36] <babonk> was wondering if i could do it on the fly?
[00:03:53] <JKarsrud> Rahly: $('<div>; ?
[00:03:59] <babonk> like fadeIn some html without giving a selector
[00:04:03] <JKarsrud> Rahly: $('<div>'); ?
[00:04:10] <Rahly> not the same, that invokes the parser
[00:04:11] <JKarsrud> babonk: not for fadeIn, no
[00:04:19] <Zackko> how do i get jquery to show errors in my firebug console?
[00:04:22] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. With hashchange event handling, if you set    var hashRef=window.location.hash how do you get the value of the hash rather than a reference to the hash?
[00:04:24] <JKarsrud> that works off jquery.fn
[00:04:32] <Skola> it already does usually Zackko
[00:04:33] <JKarsrud> Rahly: ehm, yes
[00:04:35] <Rahly> causes the dom to parse the html then do a createElement
[00:04:35] <JKarsrud> but works :P
[00:04:40] <Rahly> yes
[00:04:51] <JKarsrud> but I agree
[00:04:52] <Rahly> but $(document.createElement('div')) is faster
[00:04:58] <JKarsrud> sure is
[00:04:59] <babonk> document.location.hash works for me
[00:05:01] <Rahly> just wish there was a shortcut
[00:05:05] <Zackko> hmm well im switching over from jwee to jquery and nothin seems to work but i see no errors...very strange
[00:05:11] <Skola> Rahly roll your own
[00:05:12] <Whirl3d> I thought I was copying the value of the hash, but when I try hashRef.substr(2)  (for example) it doesn't work
[00:05:16] <Skola> :p
[00:05:17] <Rahly> like $.create('div')
[00:05:27] <JKarsrud> Rahly: make a plugin for it then?
[00:05:28] <JKarsrud> :)
[00:05:30] <Rahly> Skola: oh i have, just wish it was built in
[00:05:35] <JKarsrud> shouldn't exactly be hard :D
[00:05:48] <Skola> $.fn.create -> lulz
[00:05:49] <JKarsrud> but I see your point
[00:05:52] <Skola> would be useful actually
[00:05:55] <Rahly> the plugin wouldn't be as fast though
[00:06:00] <JKarsrud> Skola: shouldn't be on the fn tho?
[00:06:06] <Skola> you're right
[00:06:07] <Skola> ;p
[00:06:14] <JKarsrud> $.create even
[00:06:23] <Skola> Rahly doesn't have to be jQuery plugin right
[00:06:34] <juha____> Rahly: how many elements are you creating if you're running into performance problems?
[00:06:34] <Skola> just an alias function basically
[00:06:49] <Rahly> juha, a few thousand
[00:08:39] <Rahly> i get a 30% improvement from $('<div></div>') to $(document.createElement('div')); but another 15% improvement if just doing the document.createElement() without jquery
[00:09:00] <juha____> Rahly: append could be faster than creating elements with javascript.. like $(document).append('<div>' + content '</div>');
[00:09:31] <Rahly> i do an append anyway
[00:09:40] <juha____> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327047/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-create-html-elements-using-jquery
[00:09:42] <Rahly> its slower
[00:09:45] <juha____> interesting comments
[00:09:59] <juha____> pretty old though
[00:10:02] <babonk> Do you guys actually notice a difference in how fast JS is with using jquery or not?
[00:10:08] <babonk> i guess my site is small enough that the difference is negligible
[00:11:33] <Rahly> i had a function being called 100000 times, and it used $.fn.attr() to set an attribute... changed that to setAttribute() and got a 250% improvement in speed
[00:11:41] <Skola> haven't done a whole lot of profiling
[00:11:53] <Skola> but jQ is pretty damn fast at most things
[00:12:08] <Rahly> it is, if you are not calling them a lot
[00:13:13] <babonk> i think only a really hard working JS site would notice a  difference
[00:13:31] <Skola> well a lot of very busy sites use jQ
[00:13:57] <Rahly> busy vs js heavy are 2 different things in my book
[00:14:05] <Skola> yep true
[00:14:26] <Rahly> some of our software isn't busy, but is extremely js heavy
[00:14:47] <Rahly> because its a web app vs a web page
[00:15:36] <Rahly> hell, our js, is 200k even when compressed with the closure compiler
[00:15:47] <Skola> lol wow
[00:15:52] <Skola> all client-side??
[00:15:54] <babonk> rahly: what type of site?
[00:15:58] <Rahly> yes
[00:16:07] <Rahly> medical
[00:16:14] <Rahly> for doctors and hospitals
[00:16:29] <babonk> complex javascript interface?
[00:16:33] <Rahly> very
[00:16:56] <Rahly> i just got them moved over from ext to jquery, cuz ext was like 2 megs by itself
[00:18:01] <Rahly> cut js down to 300k total instead of like 3-4 megs, not including all the css pages and junk still left over
[00:19:06] <Whirl3d> how do I determine the element type of a dom object I selected by class in jquery.....like $(".topics")   where some topics are anchors, some are divs...
[00:19:54] <Rahly> .prop("nodeType") ?
[00:19:58] <Zackko> If I set the opacity using .css(), is it cros browser compatible?
[00:20:08] <Rahly> or .prop("tagName") ?
[00:20:18] <Skola> Zackko ja
[00:20:21] <ryanseddon> nodeName
[00:20:25] <ryanseddon> not type
[00:20:26] <Zackko> :)
[00:20:27] <Whirl3d> ?.prop
[00:20:34] <Whirl3d> is bot-t down?
[00:20:56] <Rahly> yeah, at first i was thinking he said type of element i thought he meant type
[00:21:15] <Rahly> tagName is the most universal i think
[00:21:33] <gnarf> Whirl3d: do you want to test it, or get it?
[00:21:54] <gnarf> Whirl3d: tagName is gonna be an upper case version of the tag name
[00:22:04] <gnarf> but, you can always .is("div")
[00:22:11] <gnarf> if you want to test for one
[00:22:12] <Whirl3d> I need to handle div topics differently than anchor topics
[00:22:44] <Rahly> and you can always use toLowerCase() too
[00:22:45] <Whirl3d> <-duh   Thanks gnarf that was stupid of me.
[00:22:58] <Whirl3d> is("div") is perfect...
[00:23:14] <Skola> why not $.each($('a.topics'), function () { // do something ...
[00:23:21] <Skola> and the same for div.topics
[00:24:18] <Rahly> esp since you are treating them different, you could seperate the code like so
[00:26:04] <Zackko> im trying to set the opacity using .css() then call .fadeIn() and its not fading in the opacity, any ideas why?
[00:26:26] <Rahly> not using rgba ?
[00:26:37] <gnarf> Zackko: might sound strange, but have you tried fadeTo? otherwise, show me some code on jsfiddle.net
[00:26:48] <Zackko> ok leme try real quick
[00:27:01] <Skola> I avoid fadeIn and fadeOut
[00:27:09] <Skola> probably nothing wrong with them
[00:27:15] <gnarf> Rahly: rgba has nothing to do with opacity animations
[00:27:17] <Skola> but I've run into crap like that before
[00:27:19] <Rahly> i find i like css transitions the best
[00:27:38] <Skola> how about performance though
[00:27:40] <Skola> have been wondering
[00:27:44] <Skola> CSS3 vs .animate()
[00:27:51] <arminrosu> and backwards compatibility
[00:28:06] <Skola> well that can be fixed with fallback to jQuery
[00:28:17] <Rahly> css3 transitions are way faster because its all done with C code instead of js
[00:28:17] <Skola> but is CSS3 preferable performance-wise
[00:28:30] <Skola> alright
[00:28:41] <Zackko> fadeTo worked, must be how they handle fadeIn wont override the opacity set using css
[00:28:45] <Zackko> thanks
[00:28:47] <SugaSlide> css transisions kinda strip my pc
[00:28:50] <SugaSlide> performance wise
[00:29:03] <arminrosu> yup, they aren't optimized yet
[00:29:09] <Skola> indeed
[00:29:15] <arminrosu> i.e. aren't using the graphics card
[00:29:18] <Skola> and diff between browsers is humongous
[00:29:28] <Rahly> but still faster than js
[00:29:34] <Skola> not always Rahly
[00:29:41] <Skola> unfortunately
[00:29:42] <arminrosu> depends on your proc.
[00:29:49] <Whirl3d> fadein and fadeout are broken...there's a trouble ticket...i don't know the exact ticket
[00:30:26] <Rahly> waht v of jquery?
[00:30:46] <Whirl3d> 1.6.1, I believe. defnitely in 1.6
[00:30:59] <Rahly> 1.5 was ok then?
[00:31:06] <Skola> doubt it
[00:31:10] <Whirl3d> not certain
[00:31:20] <gnarf> there was an opacity bug in 1.6
[00:32:21] <Whirl3d> gnarf, then the discussion is just open for the default behavior in 1.6.1, right? Isn't there some discussion about whether display should be set to "none" when using fadeIn/Out?
[00:32:50] <Whirl3d> <--could be halucinating...wouldn't be the first time.
[00:32:59] <gnarf> Whirl3d: fadeIn / fadeOut probably are checking for is(":visible")
[00:33:21] <Rahly> doesn't look like it
[00:33:41] <gnarf> i don't care enough to dig atm cuz noone has shown me the bug yet ;)
[00:34:02] <Rahly> interesting though, that fadeIn uses opacity: "show" and fadeOut uses opacity: "hide"
[00:34:43] <gnarf> meaning...
[00:35:14] <Rahly> don't remember them being valid css opacity values
[00:35:16] <Whirl3d> on the subject, anybody know why firebug gives me the error  "error in parsing opacity, definition dropped" (not using fade)
[00:35:18] <kephu> hi
[00:35:26] <kephu> anyone here use flexigrid?
[00:35:35] <gnarf> Rahly: they aren't look in the $.fx code for the show/hide special functions
[00:35:48] <gnarf> and youll see the check for visibility, and how it calculates what to fade To
[00:35:54] <kephu> ...or can recommend some other jquery plugin that receives json and spits out nifty tables?
[00:36:05] <gnarf> meaning, if you call fadeOut() on something 0.5, fadeIn() will prolly bring it back to 0.5
[00:37:04] <Rahly> right but i don't seen genFX being used for fadeIn and fadeOut, like slideUp and slideDown do
[00:37:14] <pallet> I need to do js function that is called when I tab or mouse out of a form field, how do I do it?
[00:37:57] <Whirl3d> pallet, .onBlur
[00:40:03] <Rahly> and i don't see anything special with opacity in "animate" which means it uses it as css
[00:40:33] <Whirl3d> here's a stupid js question...if, inside a "for" loop, I have a conditional statement that says, if true, skip to the next value, what does that look like?   if (condition) return? or would that exit the loop and the function?
[00:40:52] <Zackko> is there a std way of creating dom elements in jquery? i see a bunch of stuff for appending n such but no .create() or something
[00:41:11] <gnarf> Zackko: $("<div>") creates a div
[00:41:23] <Zackko> oo thts pretty cool
[00:41:58] <Zackko> what a ridiculously useful function tht $() is lol
[00:42:48] <Rahly> yes
[00:43:07] <Rahly> i naturally wrapper all jquerys in a (function($) {})(jQuery); now
[00:43:10] <GoGoGarrett> Nice, got it working :]
[00:44:05] <Zackko> if you grab an el using $(), is the .className property still there? i want to make sure i overwrite the only class on the obj
[00:44:37] <Whirl3d> Zackko, .attr("class", "newclass");
[00:44:50] <Zackko> good call tyvm
[00:48:14] <Whirl3d> when loading files through ajax, what are some ways to ensure that IDs don't get duplicated
[00:48:28] <Rahly> huh?
[00:48:47] <Rahly> what does ajaxing have to do with Ids?
[00:48:55] <Whirl3d> I have 5 pages, each with a div id='overview'   I'm loading them through ajax, their div's would conflict
[00:49:05] <Whirl3d> *ids
[00:49:20] <Rahly> overview-<number> ?
[00:49:24] <Skola> then give them a class instead
[00:50:10] <Rahly> they'd work too, if you don't need to tell which is which
[00:50:17] <palhmbs> can some jquery guru give me some hints on why Opera is so broke with http://harvest.ubuntu.com/opportunities/ ???
[00:50:18] <Rahly> *that'd
[00:50:25] <Skola> I'd say both would be best
[00:50:29] <Whirl3d> I need to be able to address them independently. I think I will just add the page name to the div's ID   like    legal-overview   just wondered if there was a better way
[00:50:36] <palhmbs> it seems that the whole page just has to refresh to do a simple bit of jquery
[00:50:38] <palhmbs> here is the launchpad bug issue -- https://bugs.launchpad.net/harvest/+bug/722947 --- which is totally unhelpful
[00:50:53] <palhmbs> needs a better description of the problem
[00:50:57] <Rahly> could also give them unique class names too
[00:53:30] <Whirl3d> I'm working on a cms, so who knows what the content will be. I just want to be sure when loading them that I don't end up with multiple ids... I was looking at serialize, but that's prolly too much
[00:53:35] <Superman_> ..
[00:54:28] <abstrusenick> Whirl3d: what kind of cms are you creating?
[00:54:32] <Rahly> i try to keep all my names short, because searching is affected by length of the string
[00:58:27] <Zackko> wjhats the easiest way to traverse a form once you grab it with $()?
[01:02:16] <pallet> I need to do js function that is called when I tab or mouse out of a form field, how do I do it?
[01:02:40] <Woet> pallet: $("#form").blur(function(){ alert('bye!'); } );
[01:03:01] <Woet> replace #form with the ID of either the form or the input field, whatever you want to catch
[01:03:10] <pallet> awesome
[01:03:14] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[01:12:19] <orolin> exit
[01:14:43] <pallet> Woet, I know there's a whole host of validation plugins, but I'm writing facebook application and I don't want loads of additionals, do you by any chance have a simple email validation function ?
[01:15:04] <zem> does anyone know why python's time.timezone == 28800 (+8) while javascript's getTimezoneOffset() == 25200000 (+7) ?
[01:15:39] <pallet> Woet, ignore my last one, I've found one
[01:21:49] <Zackko> how do you create a document fragment in jquery? and is doc fragment supported in all browsers come to think of it?
[01:23:02] <pallet> The Onblur, only works when you tab out, can I add another for when I simply leave the field by any means?
[01:24:43] <markj> Zackko you create it like usual, i dont believe there is a jquery specific way
[01:24:50] <Zackko> ok kool
[01:26:04] <markj> also Zackko, see: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html#miscellaneous for the supported browsers
[01:26:20] <Zackko> thank you :)
[01:27:13] <Zackko> how do i create a text node?
[01:27:37] <markj> ?g mdc create text node @ Zackko
[01:27:42] <markj> no bot ;[
[01:27:46] <markj> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.createTextNode
[01:28:06] <Zackko> well i meant in jquery haha
[01:28:20] <Zackko> im basically switching all my old code over to jquery
[01:28:38] <phrearch> haha, this is sick. http://syntensity.com/static/poppler.html
[01:28:52] <phrearch> pdf renderer in javascript
[01:29:10] <phrearch> pretty cool though :)
[01:29:49] <Zackko> nice
[01:30:28] <phrearch> https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki
[01:30:37] <phrearch> seems like it can compile any language to js
[01:32:37] <makinen> what's wrong with this statement: alert( $(#quickprint:visible) );
[01:33:00] <abracsi> Hi guys. does anyone know if jqueryui intends on making their draggables compatible with touch devices? i know there is a plug in out there somewhere for it, but would be nice to have out of the box...
[01:35:59] <phrearch> abracsi: how about jquery mobile?
[01:36:17] <phrearch> does that support those kind of interactions?
[01:36:34] <bittyx-laptop> makinen: you're missing quotes around the selector?
[01:37:22] <abracsi> phrearch - it's not really phones i was fussed about.. it's more tablets (iPads) that you're likely to demo your software on at exhibitions etc
[01:38:30] <phrearch> abracsi: ah ok
[01:40:54] <makinen> bittyx-laptop: thanks :D too obvious error
[01:42:16] <mateo_> Hello, i try to insert some element into a div with fixed height, and scroll that div to an inserted element in the same handler, it doesn't work, is there a proper way to do this ?
[02:07:35] <ndee> hey there, I have 5 divs and I want to show them one after another with a fadeIn, fadeOut effect, endlessly. What's the best way to do that? I tried to work with window.setTimeout but that somehow messed up the timing.
[02:13:29] <BlaDe^> if a .class { content:url(/path/to/img); } then my $('.class').hover(function() { $(this).append('<div class="tooltip">...whatever...</div>'); }); doesn't work -- any ideas why?
[02:18:16] <pilgo> I have a <textarea> with id="id_text". I can only get it's value with id_text.value and not $('#id_text').value nor $(this).value. What gives?!
[02:18:28] <Woet> pilgo: because it's .val()
[02:18:42] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/val/
[02:19:23] <pilgo> Woet: Great, thanks!
[02:26:53] <catcatcat> hi, how can I disable windows scrollbar, or hide it ?
[02:27:23] <illumina> body{ overflow: hidden;} ?
[02:28:03] <catcatcat> illumina: tried that did not work, i am trying to fix something on bloody IE7
[02:28:46] <catcatcat> i did this:  $("body").css("overflow", "hidden"); but then when i say, $("body").css("overflow", "auto"); i got two scrollbars instead
[02:29:11] <illumina> html ?
[02:29:12] <fire> hi. $('.viUI_package-holder').hasClass('active').fadeTo(). is there a possibility to change hasClass to somelike hasNotClass('active') ??
[02:29:31] <illumina> so, $('body, html').css({ "overfow": "hidden"});
[02:29:53] <catcatcat> hmm let me try that, thanks
[02:30:48] <timing_> and just put it in normal css instead of js
[02:31:13] <illumina> I have trouble with cross-browser animation speed - using cycle plugin…
[02:31:37] <catcatcat> illumina: nope did not work, it is not disabling
[02:31:42] <VictorCl2> hi
[02:32:12] <illumina> do you have any live preview ?
[02:32:51] <VictorCl2> why does this works $shownLi = $("ul.image-gallery li:visible");  $shownLi.length  .... but not this $("ul.image-gallery li").is(":visible");  $shownLi.length
[02:33:03] <VictorCl2> what makes the difference?
[02:33:31] <iszak> VictorCl2, because is returns a boolean
[02:33:45] <Klevre> Is it possible to get help for infinite scroll jquery plugin?
[02:33:47] <iszak> VictorCl2, the equivalent would be .filter(':visible')
[02:34:12] <VictorCl2> ok will check it out
[02:34:13] <VictorCl2> thanks
[02:34:30] <Klevre> I'm trying to figure out how we're supposed to add next page link after getting new content
[02:38:21] <VictorCl2> how can I get the last visible child of a list ?
[02:38:50] <Skola> $('li:visible:last')
[02:38:53] <Skola> does that work?
[02:39:23] <Skola> think it does
[02:39:36] <iszak> VictorCl2, is it of multiple lists or only one?
[02:39:52] <VictorCl2> only 1
[02:40:13] <iszak> then use :last
[02:40:23] <Rahly> or .last()
[02:40:39] <Skola> KISS ;p
[02:40:50] <Rahly> visible is the slowest query though
[02:41:18] <iszak> who cares about performance, you're using a javascript framework.
[02:41:20] <VictorCl2> .last(":visible")   , like that?
[02:41:42] <Rahly> $("li:visible").last();
[02:41:49] <Rahly> or their way
[02:42:21] <Rahly> jquery has a lot of timtowtdi
[02:43:18] <makinen> $(document).bind('keypress', 'down', key_down);
[02:43:33] <VictorCl2> cool thanks
[02:43:35] <makinen> why does that bind the function to _every_ key press event?
[02:43:50] <Rahly> cuz you asked it to?
[02:44:17] <Rahly> wouldn't it be better to bind to 'keydown' ?
[02:44:20] <makinen> okay how do I bind it to the down arrow only?
[02:44:21] <Klevre> http://www.infinite-scroll.com/ -- after loading new content, how are we supposed to update the next page link?
[02:45:31] <Rahly> Klevre: however you want to update it
[02:45:48] <Klevre> Rahly: You mean?
[02:46:09] <Rahly> yes i mean
[02:46:16] <Skola> hahaha
[02:46:21] <Skola> yes you're mean
[02:46:31] <Rahly> heh
[02:46:44] <Skola> no but seriously
[02:46:51] <Skola> Klevre, what do you mean?
[02:46:51] <makinen> Rahly: I want to trigger the dunction when a certain key has been pressed. Is it possible to give the key as an argument for bind or do I have to check the keycode in the event?
[02:46:53] <Skola> :[]
[02:47:07] <Skola> you can update it via ajax
[02:47:18] <Klevre> Skola: Are you familiar with that particular plugin?
[02:47:18] <Skola> or infinite scroll prolly provides you with a callback?
[02:47:36] <Klevre> It gives me a callback of specific data, not all data on the new page
[02:47:55] <Skola> yeah, and that data loads in your page?
[02:48:01] <Klevre> specific to the new content. The content and the navigation are in two different divs
[02:48:11] <Skola> you can still do manipulation of your nav within the callback
[02:48:14] <Rahly> makinen: test for keycode
[02:48:24] <Klevre> Skola: Jow?
[02:48:30] <Klevre> How*
[02:48:56] <Skola> got code to show me?
[02:49:08] <Klevre> http://klevre.nihplod.com/~klevre/project/mosaic/?subreddit=pics
[02:49:21] <Klevre> http://klevre.nihplod.com/~klevre/project/mosaic/js/base.js
[02:52:13] <pilgo> How do i move the i-beam to the end of the text in a textarea?
[02:53:04] <mazzachre> Is it possible to make a plugin that uses ajax function? I want to run an ajax function and then update each element with the result... So I can do $.('a').myPlugin('updatelink'); and in myPlugin updatelink function do $.ajax('myserver', {... success: function() {//Update href here with result from ajax function}}); but can I do that? Or should I just do it as a function outside and not make a plugin function for it?
[02:53:26] <Rahly> ibeam is a cursor, can you event position the cursor?
[02:53:36] <Rahly> *even
[02:53:59] <Rahly> mazzachre: yes its possible, ugly though
[02:54:34] <Rahly> sounds like it should be more of a ui plugin than a jquery one
[02:56:45] <mazzachre> Rahly: possibly... I have to "mend" a page hosted and managed by some other CMS, and I need to add a parameter to the links (to another page on their site) with some parameter (That I get via Ajax, because some stuff that have to be run in our backend) and then "mend" the form on that page with said argument (add it to a specified hidden field)
[02:57:14] <mazzachre> It is very ugly, but they are very uncooperative, so it is the only way I can see how we can do it...
[02:57:50] <Rahly> i've always found a control (ala widget) should be done in ui, not as a jquery plugin.  otherwise it should be done in the code of the page
[02:58:10] <mazzachre> Possibly I should just do it in the code of the page...
[02:58:31] <Rahly> really depends on the reuse you think you'll need
[02:58:56] <mazzachre> I am also looking for a graceful fallback if scripting is not supported (Which, on mobile webpage is a concern)
[02:59:40] <mazzachre> Rahly: Well, currently we have to do this for 3 customer pages, and we will need many more in the future (If we find a good solution)
[03:01:41] <Rahly> make your own ui namespace or use jquery ui?
[03:02:38] <mazzachre> But it is all in the background... not really a ui.
[03:07:03] <Rahly> anyone have a problem with .find() ?
[03:07:53] <Rahly> $('.class1 .class2') works but   $('.class1').find('.class2'); fails sometimes
[03:08:39] <mazzachre> Not to my knowledge... I use find in some instances and it always seems to work.
[03:08:51] <Rahly> interesting thing though    $('.class1').get(0).querySelectorAll('.class2');  works
[03:08:52] <Clonix> for me the same
[03:09:18] <mazzachre> Rahly: How "fails sometimes"?
[03:09:47] <Rahly> it works most of the time, but every now and again it just fails with certain elements, and i can't figure out the connection
[03:10:11] <mazzachre> As in "not finding the element" or as in "throws error"?
[03:10:18] <Rahly> not finding the element
[03:12:08] <Rahly> ok i take that back,  it happens in a .each .find
[03:12:11] <mazzachre> OK, is this on a dynamicly created page? Have you checked that the element is actually there, when the script is run? I have had problems before where dynamically generated pages were not always ready when $.ready() is called (Because it is called the instant the page is loaded and DOM tree is generated) so stuff that is added by other scripts may or may not be there when some other script is run, depending on threads and stuff
[03:13:07] <Rahly> $('.class1').each( function() { $(this.find('.class2'); /* nothing */ this.querySelectorAll('.class2'); /* correct elements */ });
[03:13:23] <khelll> Hello, can anyone give me a hand in this little thing http://pastie.org/2026604
[03:13:35] <Rahly> yes
[03:13:36] <heatxsink> is there an example of a long list of items that are touchable and scrolling said long list?
[03:14:01] <Rahly> because when debugging it, i run the statements $(this).find('.class2') // fails
[03:14:13] <heatxsink> err for mobiled
[03:14:14] <Rahly> but this.querySelectorAll('.class2'); works
[03:14:23] <heatxsink> mobile*
[03:14:27] <Rahly> and $('.class1 .class2') works
[03:15:02] <BlaDe^> I have a title element which contains *Item one *Item two
[03:15:17] <BlaDe^> I want to convert that to <ul><li>Item one</li><li>Item two</li></ul> -- what's the best way?
[03:15:45] <Rahly> i like my stuff readable
[03:16:52] <RandomMadName> Hi! May I interrupt?
[03:18:16] <mazzachre> Rahly: That is strange...
[03:18:29] <Rahly> what is?
[03:18:59] <mazzachre> BlaDe^: How do you have that list?
[03:19:01] <VictorCl2> how can I check if a class exist in the document?
[03:19:21] <Rahly> $('.class').length > 0 ?
[03:19:27] <nVeeYAM> hey guys. I need advise. I am writing a script which will make an $.post() call to a php file. The PHP file will print_r() an array of either 1 array value which would be true, or 2 or more of which the first key would be false and the remaining values would be reasons for false (errors). my $.post call does give me the "array" back, but not in a readable format for javascript/jquery
[03:20:09] <Rahly> you should use something like json_encode($array) in php
[03:20:25] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: what is your mime type set to?
[03:20:35] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: for the response of the POST
[03:21:00] <Rahly> doesn't matter what the mime type is, print_r is not a parsable format for js
[03:21:03] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: content type not mim type
[03:21:34] <Rahly> well for anyone
[03:21:42] <heatxsink> Rahly: agreed, but the content type has to be the right, i've run into that one before, unless there some kind of cool new magical way of doing it
[03:21:46] <BlaDe^> mazzachre what do you mean ?
[03:21:51] <Rahly> if anything, var_export() would be next in like, but json_encode should be first
[03:22:00] <Rahly> *in line
[03:22:17] <BlaDe^> I want to convert *Item one *Item two into an array I guess.. in PHP i'd use explode( ), there must be some split method in js
[03:22:32] <Rahly> i don't think there is a mimetype for a print_r :P
[03:22:40] <Rahly> unless you count text/plain
[03:22:45] <heatxsink> Rahly: agreed.
[03:22:46] <nVeeYAM> well my return is "echo json_encode(array());
[03:22:49] <nVeeYAM> if that makes sense?
[03:23:03] <nVeeYAM> sorry i feel like such a chop that I cannot provide you with  more useful feedback :)
[03:23:07] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: can you gist your php or pastebin it or something?
[03:23:07] <nVeeYAM> im very new to jquery
[03:23:09] <Rahly> as long as you have the json functions
[03:23:19] <nVeeYAM> heatxsink, sure :)
[03:23:40] <Rahly> lol, heatxsink its only one line
[03:24:14] <Rahly> it should be "header('Content-Type: application/json'); print json_encode(array());"
[03:25:02] <Rahly> although, an empty array comes back as an array not an object
[03:25:12] <heatxsink> Rahly: yup
[03:25:23] <heatxsink> Rahly: i just want to take a look at the whole thing
[03:25:24] <Rahly> php can't differentiate between an array and an associative array
[03:25:56] <nVeeYAM> http://pastebin.com/ML2CKLMi
[03:26:03] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: thx
[03:26:15] <nVeeYAM> sorry, i only started to think about using json this morning
[03:26:18] <Rahly> don't forget the header
[03:26:28] <nVeeYAM> Rahly: I'm sorry, header?
[03:26:29] <nVeeYAM> :)
[03:26:59] <Rahly> header('Content-Type: application/json');
[03:27:19] <Rahly> before you print/echo
[03:27:24] <nVeeYAM> ahhh
[03:27:55] <Rahly> that should tell jquery that you are sending json, should come back to the post
[03:29:57] <nVeeYAM> awesome, added it :)
[03:30:06] <Rahly> errr ok
[03:31:50] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: did it work?
[03:34:23] <nVeeYAM> heatxsink: I think so
[03:34:35] <nVeeYAM> I can count the array elements in jquery so i think we have a winner :P
[03:35:00] <Rahly> i'm starting to store data in my db, as json objects, easier to push out to a client
[03:35:38] <heatxsink> Rahly: what language?
[03:35:46] <heatxsink> nVeeYAM: sweet!
[03:36:05] <Rahly> huh?
[03:36:09] <Rahly> language?
[03:41:01] <Anze> hi, i'm having troubles with masonry plugin, it does calculate left:0px for all elements - see here left menu http://www.e-trgovine.si/
[03:49:31] <fructose> I'm trying to "embed" a value in a table row so I can retrieve it later with jQuery, but my only idea so far is setting it as the class, but the problem is that it's already a member of a class. Any thoughts?
[03:50:22] <Skola> you can set multiple classes
[03:50:23] <Rahly> $tablerow.data("name", "value"); ?
[03:50:40] <Skola> yes that's much better
[03:53:57] <Pfeifakopf> hi. how can i fadein the flow-divs, with clicking on the h3?  http://postimage.org/image/2sxa2i9qc/
[03:54:14] <fructose> Skola: The problem is knowing which class is the value
[03:54:27] <Skola> why is it a problem
[03:55:06] <Pfeifakopf> i tried it with next, but this didnt work
[03:55:28] <Skola> you mean like $('h3').fadeIn()?
[03:56:10] <fructose> Skola: Pretty straight-forward. If you don't know which one is the value, you don't know which one is the value.
[03:56:48] <Skola> don't be butthurt over it
[03:56:54] <Skola> you could test for the value of the row
[03:57:01] <Pfeifakopf> i mean: $('h3').click()(function(){$(".flow").next().fadeIn('slow');}
[03:57:04] <Skola> if you really can't know
[03:57:36] <Pfeifakopf> something like that...
[03:57:51] <fructose> Skola: The example would be class="foo val1234" ... how could I narrow it down to the "1234". the [name|="value"] selector doesn't seem to work for classes
[03:58:34] <Skola> $('h3').click(function () { $(this).next().fadeIn('slow');} Pfeifakopf
[03:59:05] <Skola> you could do a regexp on the class
[03:59:14] <Skola> not the most solid idea, but
[03:59:37] <Skola> if you have time for it look at .data()
[04:00:22] <fructose> Yeah, I did, but I'd much rather add information inline than attach it with JS
[04:00:41] <Pfeifakopf> hmm. ok. works fine. thanks Skola
[04:00:48] <Skola> no problem
[04:01:02] <Skola> fructose you can do a regular expression on the class
[04:02:15] <markj> cant you just find any classes that start with val then split the classname to get the value? or is 'val' just an example?
[04:02:17] <Rahly> actually for classes it would be   [value~=classname]
[04:02:39] <Rahly> like   [class~=val1234]
[04:04:08] <Rahly> classes are space separated, not hyphen separated
[04:04:19] <fructose> Rahly: I would think that'd just give you the element, but not the class, no?
[04:04:59] <Rahly> yes, but if you are using the selector like that, you already know the class :P
[04:05:01] <fructose> Rahly: The goal isn't finding the class, it's that I already have an element and want to extract (hidden) data from it
[04:05:15] <VictorCl2> today I learn about this site -> http://www.lorempixum.com/    pretty usefull
[04:05:19] <Rahly> i wouldn't use class names like that
[04:05:24] <Rahly> thats what .data is for
[04:05:33] <Skola> he wants in the dom
[04:05:35] <markj> if you really dont want to use .data use data attributes
[04:05:50] <markj> data-yourattributename="whatever"
[04:05:54] <Skola> don't data attribs break in bad browsers?
[04:06:06] <markj> its invalid in old browsers but it wont break anything
[04:06:15] <Rahly> well attributes in general break the format of the data
[04:06:44] <markj> what do you mean they break the format?
[04:07:09] <Rahly> it forces all values to be strings, not what you put in
[04:07:44] <Rahly> .data gives you back what you put in
[04:07:51] <markj> fair enough
[04:08:15] <markj> its not a huge problem if you know what the var type should be, but i guess if it could be a string or an int it might be
[04:08:36] <Rahly> well it does if you use a dom element or object
[04:09:16] <Anze> hi, i'm having troubles with masonry plugin, it does calculate left:0px for all elements - see here left menu http://www.e-trgovine.si/
[04:09:19] <Rahly> for example... $ele.attr("value", dom) = stores the string "[object]"
[04:09:37] <Rahly> but $ele.data("value", dom); stores the dom object or jquery object
[04:10:16] <markj> i wouldnt recommend data-attributes in that instance :) data is the better option but he doesnt seem to like the idea
[04:10:53] <Pfeifakopf> Skola: I have on more question. could i animate an element inside the the div .flow with clicking on the some h3
[04:11:20] <Rahly> the only thing better than .data() is .setUserData()
[04:11:21] <Skola> yes
[04:11:40] <fructose> Rahly, markj: Yes, it feels a bit messy... since it's dynamically-generated, I'd still have the same problem of figuring out how to attach the data to each row later or perform the JS inline
[04:12:24] <Skola> it's a matter of getting used to it
[04:13:14] <fructose> But the data-attr solution is certainly easy enough... I just hope it doesn't cause browser issues
[04:13:48] <logo440> Hi everybody!
[04:13:55] <logo440> Is there a way to disable vertical scrolling without having problems with the content jumping?
[04:14:03] <logo440> If I use sth like $('element').css({"overflow":"hidden"}) the content in FF jumps to the right because of the new space.
[04:14:09] <logo440> If I use $(window).scroll(function() {$(window).scrollTop(0)}); the event handler is to slow and there is a little scrolling down before the scrollTop(0) is called.
[04:15:04] <Rahly> why not just $(window).scrollTop(0) without the scroll()
[04:15:12] <Pfeifakopf> i tried this... $("#productList h3").toggle(function() {$(this).next(".animate", this).animate(...); }); Skola
[04:16:00] <Skola> $("#productList h3").toggle(function() {$(this).next(".flow").children(".someselector").animate(...); });
[04:16:06] <Skola> more something like that
[04:16:34] <logo440> Rahly: because i want to disable scrolling for a time
[04:20:22] <Rahly> not sure what you want to do... for everytime you scroll, you are scrolling to the top... it doesn't make sense
[04:20:36] <logo440> i want stop scrolling
[04:20:38] <Rahly> you could just use overflow-y: hidden
[04:20:47] <logo440> yep
[04:21:00] <logo440> but in this case the content jumps to the right
[04:21:06] <logo440> in ff
[04:21:55] <Pfeifakopf> Skola: thanks a lot!
[04:22:30] <Skola> no problem
[04:25:28] <muszek_> hi... I'd like to select a bunch of elements and join (implode) their attributes together... can it be achieved elegantly in one line?  my lame code: http://jsfiddle.net/muszek/Pq66U/1/
[04:27:21] <Skola> I think underscore.js lets you do a reduce on a group of dom elements
[04:28:48] <muszek_> Skola: thanks
[04:28:58] <Skola> so like _.reduce($('yourelements'), function (i, elem, memo) { return memo + elem.attr('lol'); });
[04:29:24] <jayflux> Skola out of interest do you use a CMS or a framework when building sites
[04:29:32] <Skola> I use node.js
[04:30:03] <Skola> building my own portfolio site now, with my own CMS
[04:30:08] <Skola> lots of fun
[04:30:18] <jayflux> oh right, one you've written yourself? in PHP?
[04:30:19] <muszek_> Skola: node.js for all of server-side code?
[04:30:25] <Skola> yes
[04:30:31] <jayflux> ah ok
[04:30:41] <jayflux> What if it was for a client?
[04:30:54] <Skola> same now
[04:31:00] <muszek_> does that make a lot of sense? (serious question)
[04:31:12] <Skola> ja it does I think
[04:31:19] <Skola> I'm working on a CMS
[04:31:23] <muszek_> cool
[04:31:29] <Skola> so I'll just reuse it and add to it
[04:31:41] <Skola> right now there aren't a lot of good CMS yet
[04:31:43] <Skola> for node
[04:31:50] <Skola> so that's a good excuse :D
[04:31:59] <Skola> but it's easy to make sites with node
[04:32:03] <Skola> don't need a cms
[04:32:09] <jayflux> I dont know much about node.js
[04:32:17] <Skola> my current portfolio/cms is 1300 lines of code
[04:32:22] <Skola> in coffeescript
[04:32:34] <Skola> and that includes templates and css
[04:32:40] <jayflux> thats good
[04:33:38] <Skola> the coffeescript is like 400 lines
[04:33:44] <Skola> the resulting JS is about 800
[04:34:12] <jayflux> Yeah I will have a good read up on coffeescript one day
[04:34:59] <Skola> the docs kick ass
[04:35:10] <Rahly> iKlggcrtfm will be better
[04:35:21] <Skola> what's that you keep mentioning
[04:35:28] <Skola> I know what the last 4 letters stand for but
[04:35:30] <Skola> :[]
[04:35:51] <Rahly> funny, i didn't even see that until you mentioned it
[04:36:03] <Skola> lol
[04:36:23] <jayflux> Skola: I heard duhsuehicrtfm will be the dog's nuts
[04:37:49] <Skola> sounds good
[04:37:52] <Skola> :[]
[04:51:10] <greg_f> In js possible to use '1 in [1, 2, 3, 4]'?
[04:51:52] <xec> greg_f: that looks funky, whats it supposed to do
[04:54:14] <greg_f> xec: it should check if element present in array...
[04:56:03] <xec> greg_f: hmm, without really knowing im gonna answer you just because noone else is: im guessing you would need to loop the array and check each value if it matches
[04:56:31] <greg_f> oh
[04:57:40] <xec> greg_f: maybe some help here? http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/testing_for_a_v
[04:58:29] <Woet> greg_f: array.indexOf(1);
[04:58:38] <Woet> returns -1 if it's not found, returns the key if it's found
[04:58:58] <greg_f> Woet: thanks a lot
[04:59:14] <greg_f> xec: thanks too!
[05:01:19] <xec> Woet: will indexOf() find content of the array?
[05:01:24] <Woet> yes
[05:01:43] <Woet> and you can just use if(array[1] !== undefined) to search by ID
[05:01:50] <xec> oh. i figured it would only match the key
[05:02:48] <xec> but thats what it would return
[05:02:51] <xec> nevermind me
[05:03:17] * Woet neverminds xec
[05:03:23] * xec hides
[05:12:51] <roger_padactor> weird thing happening with dialog box with multiple datepickers.  $('.date').each(function(i,elm){$(elm).datepicker();}); works but I click on the first inputbox nothing happens. Click on the second. datepicker opens. click on the first again and it opens. bug?
[05:15:23] <makinen> how can I select the first li elemnent inside ul?
[05:16:20] <Skola> $('ul li:first')
[05:17:07] <Rahly> ul > li:first would be faster
[05:17:11] <aro> i have this JSON string: {"Error":{"popup":"Postal Code 48108SADGASDGSA not found for ANN ARBOR, MI"}} - why is it that when i do an alert on $( json.Error.popup ).length it returns 0? assuming that 'json'
[05:17:23] <Skola> would it?
[05:17:30] <Rahly> yes
[05:17:53] <Rahly> because > forces it to look for children of ul, instead of anywhere in the tree
[05:18:47] <Skola> :o
[05:19:00] <Skola> I thought ul li would do as well
[05:19:26] <Skola> if there are no other dom elements to parse other than li's
[05:19:39] <roger_padactor> how do you remove the focus on an input?  So the cursor isn't there?
[05:24:35] <aro> anyone know
[05:24:40] <Skola> yeah
[05:24:43] <Skola> :[]
[05:24:50] <aro> or can jquery not pull lengths of json objects
[05:25:04] <aro> would i be better off using typeof instead?
[05:25:11] <Skola> what?
[05:25:14] <Skola> to see if it's defined?
[05:25:18] <aro> <aro> i have this JSON string: {"Error":{"popup":"Postal Code 48108SADGASDGSA not found for ANN ARBOR, MI"}} - why is it that when i do an alert on $( json.Error.popup ).length it returns 0? assuming that 'json'
[05:25:35] <Skola> hm
[05:25:42] <Skola> use json.Error.popup.length?
[05:25:45] <Skola> I think
[05:26:01] <Rahly> i use to live in MI
[05:26:12] <aro> where in MI?
[05:26:39] <Rahly> newar Saginaw/Bay CIty
[05:26:47] <aro> oh cool, i have a few friends there
[05:27:02] <jrbass> so i have an intresting problem/situation. i have this 'projector screen' type thing, when i click the pull tag, it comes down, and a video loads. then you can click it to close it up again...
[05:27:06] <Rahly> why are you jquerifying a string?
[05:27:18] <aro> its an object, not a string
[05:27:20] <jrbass> the thing is, when it comes down, it goes over a link. and when it goes back up, the link loses function
[05:27:20] <aro> i meant object
[05:27:37] <Skola> you mean you can't click it jrbass?
[05:27:39] <Rahly> ummmm json.Error.popup is a string according to your example
[05:27:48] <Skola> is there perhaps a div over the link?
[05:27:50] <Adnarim> Hello, could someone help me with my slider?
[05:27:54] <jrbass> yea, doesnt rollover/hover anymore
[05:27:57] <jrbass> but it does in IE
[05:28:09] <Skola> go look if there's a div over the link :[]
[05:28:19] <Rahly> most browsers have a problem with :hover in that you need a tag name
[05:28:24] <jrbass> theres only one div, and that animates() up
[05:28:28] <Rahly> for example DIV.class:hover { }
[05:28:54] <Rahly> .class:hover { } may or may not work
[05:29:02] <jrbass> wanna see it for yourself i'll give you the link
[05:29:59] <Adnarim> Could someone help me with a little change in my slider?
[05:30:37] <Skola> state your problem
[05:30:40] <Skola> helps
[05:31:03] <Rahly> alert(json.Error.popup); // works
[05:31:14] <jrbass> Rahly: its just a regular link
[05:31:23] <jrbass> its a heading link on my blog
[05:31:29] <Rahly> A.class:hover ?
[05:31:38] <Adnarim> I had a slider with 2 handles, and changed range to false, so now i have just one left, but now i want it to fill from 0 to the handle
[05:31:43] <Skola> jrbass send me link if you want
[05:32:39] <jrbass> a:hover
[05:32:42] <nVeeYAM> how can I count or get the amount of array fields in a json array from jquery?
[05:33:39] <Rahly> nVeeYAM: thats a huge traversal
[05:34:09] <Adnarim> i'm new to jquery and can't figure out how to get a fill in the slider
[05:34:25] <nVeeYAM> if my array has 3 values, what function can I use to return "3"?
[05:34:36] <jrbass> Adnarim: a fill?
[05:34:41] <nVeeYAM> i want to use it for a for loop
[05:34:58] <Rahly> array.length
[05:35:15] <Adnarim> uhm, like a green background for example between 0 and where the handle is
[05:35:20] <samuelj> Can someone advise why the following is displaying an alert box with no content?
[05:35:24] <samuelj> var ideaPartial = '';
[05:35:24] <samuelj>  15         $.get("partials/idea.html", function(data){
[05:35:24] <samuelj>  16           ideaPartial = data;
[05:35:24] <samuelj>  17         });
[05:35:25] <samuelj>  18
[05:35:25] <samuelj>  19         alert(ideaPartial);
[05:35:32] <Rahly> whoa, use pastebin
[05:35:44] <samuelj> sorry i thought it would be ok for just a few lines
[05:36:06] <Rahly> .get is async, ideaPartial will not be populated until after the ajax happens
[05:36:29] <samuelj> oh, so it's calling alert before get is finished?
[05:37:27] <Rahly> yes
[05:37:37] <Rahly> put the alert in the function, and it'll come out
[05:37:49] <samuelj> ok thanks
[05:38:02] <samuelj> i can't put the alert in the function
[05:38:06] <Rahly> why not?
[05:38:16] <samuelj> because i don't really want the alert, it's an example
[05:38:26] <samuelj> i just need to access ideaPartial on other events
[05:39:01] <Rahly> which you can still do, just after the ajax is done
[05:39:12] <krille> Hi, I cant install the nivo-slider and i dont know what the problem is, please help. I can give you a link so you guys can see all my files.
[05:39:25] <Adnarim> jrbass: do you understand what i mented with the fill?
[05:39:41] <samuelj> yeah ok, Rahly do i need to impose some sort of wait? or are we just talking a few milliseconds
[05:40:16] <Rahly> i'm talking about network latency and delayed routes possibly
[05:40:30] <Rahly> ajax is expensive network wise
[05:40:39] <jrbass> not really
[05:40:56] <samuelj> ok thanks
[05:41:00] <jrbass> yay! Skola for president!

[06:00:28] <Woet> Adnarim: give me the link to it
[06:00:32] <samuelj> hey everyone, can anyone help me figure this out? http://pastie.org/2027121  the error is in the pastie... basically it's just not displaying the template on .post success
[06:01:28] <Adnarim> Woet: gues i had to click save xD here's the link http://jsfiddle.net/nzzFu/
[06:01:43] <Skola> samuelj
[06:01:47] <Skola> what's tmpl supposed to be?
[06:02:02] <samuelj> it's a jquery method? Skola
[06:02:08] <samuelj> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[06:02:39] <Woet> Adnarim: what is dragFill doing there?
[06:03:10] <Adnarim> woet: i was trying xD
[06:03:25] <Skola> samuelj version?
[06:05:06] <samuelj> 1.6 Skola
[06:05:47] <Adnarim> woet: should i remove it again?
[06:05:53] <Woet> Adnarim: yes.
[06:06:01] <Adnarim> woet: oke, done
[06:06:50] <Adnarim> woet: what should i do to make it fill till the handle?
[06:06:55] <Woet> Adnarim: and did you try removing all unnecessary code (e.g. the slide functions?)
[06:07:02] <Woet> going back to the basic
[06:07:44] <AdvoWork> whats the best way to check for a checkbox being ticked? im doing: if($('#chosen_sortnew').length > 0) {  but its always 1, even if checked..
[06:07:48] <AdvoWork> even if not checked i mean
[06:08:51] <woozly|job> $.getJSON( ..., function () {}); <--- in function didn't see global variables :( why?
[06:09:01] <samuelj> Skola: you got any suggestions?
[06:09:29] <woozly|job> var MyGlobal = 123; $.getJSON(... function() { alert(MyGlobal); }); <--- causes 'Not define variable
[06:09:39] <Adnarim> woet: I don't know what is unneccessary, I'm not familiar with jquery yet, but i had to edit this for where i work.
[06:09:58] <Woet> Adnarim: then you should read the docs
[06:10:06] <Woet> Adnarim: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[06:10:11] <Woet> it has working source and lots of examples.
[06:11:02] <Woet> Adnarim: for example, why is range set to false?
[06:11:06] <Woet> Adnarim: try range: "min"
[06:11:26] <Adnarim> woet: because i wanted it to be 1 handle instead of 2, which it was before
[06:11:35] <Woet> Adnarim: then set range to "min"
[06:11:57] <Woet> Adnarim: straight from the docs at http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
[06:12:02] <Woet> "If set to true, the slider will detect if you have two handles and create a stylable range element between these two. Two other possible values are 'min' and 'max'. A min range goes from the slider min to one handle. A max range goes from one handle to the slider max."
[06:12:10] <Woet> so it's either true, "min" or "max"
[06:12:21] <Adnarim> woet: woow, great, it now works :D
[06:12:27] <Woet> yay!
[06:12:30] <Woet> good job miranda
[06:12:37] <Adnarim> woet: oh i thought only boolean was allowed
[06:12:48] <inumedia> How would I get the height of a div with overflow: auto?  o-o
[06:12:51] <Woet> docs say otherwise
[06:13:18] <Adnarim> apparently :)
[06:13:19] <inumedia> Er, not the height but the actual height with the scroll bar?
[06:13:30] <samuelj> http://pastie.org/2027121 -- anyone got any thoughts on this? The error's included, though it's just not bringing up the partial :( any help would be greatly appreciated
[06:13:32] <Adnarim> woet: thanks for your help, now my website is done :D
[06:13:36] <Woet> yay!
[06:14:32] <Woet> Adnarim: why didn't you look at the documentation?
[06:14:41] <Woet> it has a list of all options and their values
[06:14:42] <Woet> and examples
[06:14:45] <Woet> it's quite useful :)
[06:14:53] <Adnarim> woet: I guess i missed it =X
[06:15:06] <Adnarim> woet: yeah i'll keep it in mind for next time :D
[06:16:16] <Woet> Adnarim: did you try doing /whois Woet
[06:17:00] <Adnarim> woet: no why?
[06:17:05] <Woet> you should
[06:17:19] <Adnarim> lol
[06:18:48] <paul_uk> hey all, can anyone a plugin that changes the selectbox to a nice UI?  Something that doesn't use JQ UI as well.
[06:28:53] <AdvoWork> has jquery got a way to do say: field = '<input type="checkbox"  ' + if(.... !=  undefined; { checked=true } else { //nothing } ?
[06:29:14] <gym_jane> .seen aamir
[06:29:14] <hsbot> aamir was seen 1 week, 2 days and 3 hours ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Away!
[06:29:47] <Vegar> is there a nice way to do drag-and-drop rearranging of table rows?
[06:30:48] <xec> AdvoWork: .val() can check or uncheck checkboxes http://api.jquery.com/val/
[06:32:15] <AdvoWork> xec,  im constructing a form and its input fields based on that check, so i need to set it to checked or not checked. I had if .. undefined etc var chosen = "checked=true" else var chosen = ""  }  BUT for not checked it just does ="" in my code, god knows how
[06:32:26] <gym_jane> hi xec, i was wondering if you could point me in the right direction
[06:33:29] <gym_jane> i need a a sticky box at the bottom of my screen, on click it should hide and show. any links or tutorials on something similar?
[06:33:47] <xec> AdvoWork: sorry, i couldnt make much sense of that, could you maybe construct a demo in jsfiddle.net?
[06:34:10] <xec> gym_jane: how do you click something that is hidden? :)
[06:34:28] <gym_jane> well not hidden but collapsed really
[06:34:49] <gym_jane> would have a little button on top right that allow you to slide it down and up
[06:36:20] <xec> gym_jane: i would probably just make one from scratch, shouldnt be too hard. have you found anything on google?
[06:37:26] <djQuery> AdvoWork: $('<input />', {type: 'checkbox', checked: ((myvar!===undefined && myvar)?'checked':'')})
[06:38:04] <gym_jane> xec, unfortunately i haven't and i been looking for a while now
[06:38:26] <gym_jane> kinda under pressure hence had to bother you :@
[06:38:37] <djQuery> Vegar: see ?ui.sortable
[06:38:46] <Vegar> djQuery: thanks
[06:38:53] <djQuery> .seen bot-t

[06:39:01] <djQuery> damn lazy bot
[06:40:18] <Vegar> does jquery work on mobile devices (android/opera)?
[06:40:40] <djQuery> Vegar: yes and there is a whole jquery mobile as well
[06:40:49] <Vegar> neat
[06:40:57] <Vegar> jquery rocks
[06:41:00] <djQuery> Vegar: http://jquerymobile.com/
[06:41:55] <Vegar> right, so jquery mobile is for UI mostly?
[06:42:06] <djQuery> Vegar: mostly
[06:44:02] <xec> gym_jane: http://jsfiddle.net/4X2Ps/2/
[06:44:46] <gym_jane> xec, you are star! didn't expect that. checking it now thank you
[06:47:23] <gym_jane> any reason why that doesn't work in Chrome?
[06:47:59] <djQuery> gym_jane: works on my chrome 13.0.782.10
[06:48:50] <gym_jane> perhaps i am doing something wrong in my texteditor
[06:48:52] <gym_jane> works online
[06:48:54] <gym_jane> you are right
[06:49:12] <gym_jane> does it have to use two divs?
[06:49:59] <xec> gym_jane: i put in the other one to have something to click after its hidden.. you might not want to slide it all the way out
[06:50:16] <gym_jane> kool
[06:50:22] <newbie> Hello
[06:51:02] <gl0w> Anyone interested in helping troubleshoot a bit? :)
[06:51:52] <xec> gym_jane: i didnt mean that to be a finished solution, just an idea to get you started.
[06:52:18] <xec> gl0w: whats the issue? and do you have a live url?
[06:52:41] <gym_jane> xec what am i doing wrong here then? http://pastebin.com/TjKetngY
[06:52:50] <gl0w> Its a handler.apply issue and yes I do.  Mind going PM?
[06:55:46] <xec> gym_jane: try document ready wrapper
[06:55:51] <gym_jane> k
[06:57:28] <gl0w> how bad is it to use a lot of .live calls? Should I switch them all to delegate? Is it possible that having too many could eventually cause a handler.apply is not a function error?
[06:57:29] <ryanneufeld> Vegar: jquerymobile does more than just UI
[06:58:18] <ryanneufeld> Vegar: it also caches the pages in the DOM as you navigate, it's all done via ajax, so when you go back, there is not an additional HTTP Request
[06:58:43] <ryanneufeld> gl0w: if you have a lot of them you might want to take a step back and look at how your app is designed.
[07:00:18] <gl0w> I intend to consolodate them later, but its highly dynamic and needs a lot of specific actions. Is there a better way of doing that?
[07:03:28] <gl0w> I am getting n.handler.apply is not a function, when I single-click on a textarea that has both focus and dblclick handlers on it.
[07:05:24] <gl0w> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/401599/

[07:18:47] <SoulRaven> hi
[07:19:44] <SoulRaven> is any solution to detect when a field is invalid on a form, before submitting, using ajax and click trigger?
[07:20:53] <pouyt> $('form').submit(function(){})
[07:21:45] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/hMTKv/
[07:22:29] <SoulRaven> now i trigger a click on the submit button, for start the html5 validation, but i want if a field is invalid to not submit the data
[07:23:12] <ThomK> Even if type in Chrome console directly $('#foo').fadeIn(1000).delay(1000).fadeOut(1000) there is exception, so dunno. :(
[07:24:02] <orolo> ?html5
[07:24:17] <SoulRaven> ?
[07:24:26] <orolo> what is that great website that shows all of the html5 tags?
[07:24:40] <orolo> (sorry, i thought bot-t might know).
[07:25:05] <xec> orolo: http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements perhaps?
[07:25:07] <samuelj> Any chance anyone could take a look at this? http://pastie.org/2027121 -- I'm so confused! It just won't load the partial on callback from post
[07:25:23] <Odd_Bloke> Hello all.  With JQuery Mobile in Chromium, I'm using a <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"> containing several <li><a href="#subpage">Foo</a></li>.  When I click on one of these, the button glitches to full screen and then the page transitions.  I don't see this on http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/buttons/ which I copied.
[07:25:28] <Odd_Bloke> Any thoughts on what might be causing it?
[07:25:33] <orolo> xec, no, it's more of a complete, single serve website for html5. i'll find it. thank you.
[07:27:02] <xec> ThomK: does jQuery('#foo').fadeIn(1000).delay(1000).fadeOut(1000); work?
[07:27:32] <NodoLibero> hi

[07:29:41] <xec> ThomK: on any browser? do you have a url/testcase?
[07:29:48] <samuelj> anyone? I'm so stuck!
[07:30:09] <hillct> Good morning all. I'm looking at this example http://jsfiddle.net/cF6Ya/ and trying to determine how to convert the 'events' structure into valid JSON, presumably by implementing the Date element not as a JS Date object but as a scalar epoch time integer. As far as I know, the .valueOf() a date object is supposed to be the epochTime anyway, so I haven't been able to work out why that doesn't work. I wonder if anyone can provide some guidan
[07:30:10] <hillct> this point. Thank you.
[07:30:21] <NodoLibero> tman: it is
[07:31:46] <ThomK> xec: On Firefox there is exception: TypeError: types is undefined
[07:33:44] <Guest81252> how do i get the value of css position absolute, left
[07:33:52] <tman> NodoLibero: should firebug update the href ?
[07:33:58] <tman> because it's not, i have it highlighted
[07:34:03] <tman> and the js is firing
[07:34:15] <tman> but the href isn't updating, if i console it it returns what i'd expect.
[07:34:18] <xec> ThomK: must be a bug somewhere else in your code, i think... http://jsfiddle.net/x6kpq/ - works fine for me
[07:34:21] <pouyt> Guest81252: .position().left
[07:36:24] <NodoLibero> tman: the DOM gets updated on mine (ff and chrome)
[07:36:37] <NodoLibero> and so does on the console
[07:37:40] <tman> hmm ok, weird.
[07:37:44] <tman> does in the console
[07:37:46] <ThomK> xec: I'm running not minified version and exception is thrown at jquery-1.6.1.js line 2571, where is types = types.split(" ");
[07:37:51] <tman> but not whemn i click the links
[07:37:57] * tman keeps playing with it.
[07:38:27] <xec> ThomK: did you get the error from the jsfiddle i posted too?
[07:40:33] <ThomK> xec: no :P
[07:41:32] <xec> ThomK: if i were you, i'd look for other things that could be wrong, i dont think its that oneliner thats making it bug.
[07:42:01] <ndimatteo> does anyone know how to get this plugin to SHOW the scrollbar, in case the user wants to just navigate without clicking? http://www.queness.com/post/356/create-a-vertical-horizontal-and-diagonal-sliding-content-website-with-jquery
[07:42:17] <ndimatteo> (it's a full-screen jquery slider)
[07:43:17] <xec> ndimatteo: remove overflow: hidden; css rule on body and #wrapper
[07:44:37] <xec> ndimatteo: on the other hand, that destroys the script for some reason :D
[07:44:40] <ndimatteo> xec: I tried that in firebug and the slider stops firing
[07:44:50] <ndimatteo> haha yep!
[07:45:35] <xec> ndimatteo: ok, overflow: auto; on #wrapper
[07:45:40] <Odd_Bloke> I've confirmed that I'm having the same display problem on an Android phone.
[07:46:18] <xec> ndimatteo: you can keep the one on body, really
[07:46:37] <ndimatteo> xec: thanks man, that was an easy fix :)
[07:46:50] <xec> yw :)
[07:47:00] <xec> lucky guess
[07:52:02] <kmindi> hi, how can I tell jquery to add percent to the current size. I want to do this with amount  beeing a percent value: $('#'+lData.leftId).width("+="+amount+'%');
[07:53:51] <Juzzy> do you need to divide by 100 too?
[07:54:06] <Juzzy> you could just .append() it
[07:55:07] <kmindi> what do you mean by .append(ing) it?
[07:55:13] <kmindi> i need to resize the div
[07:55:22] <skylamer`> u can use css after
[07:55:27] <hillct> In case anyone is curious, the solution to my issue was JS Date.valueOf() == UnixEpochTime * 1000 as shown here http://jsfiddle.net/cF6Ya/1/
[07:57:49] <kmindi> or maybe better question for what im trying to do: is there an animation for sizing? which accepts +=5% for example to make something 5% higher/wider with animation?
[08:02:33] <toxz> is it usefull to init vars with "var" or is it useless?
[08:02:36] <markj> kmindi you can use += when you use .css or animate
[08:03:36] <SoulRaven> is any solution to capture if a field is invalid, when is used require atribute?
[08:03:38] <markj> toxz if you dont declare a var using the var keyword, it will become part of the global scope, i.e. a property of the window object, which you dont want
[08:03:51] <markj> well you might in some cases, but in general you wont
[08:04:09] <markj> if you use var it will scope the variable to the function it is within
[08:04:16] <markj> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[08:04:32] <toxz> uuuu - thats a good point to use "var"
[08:04:45] <toxz> markj - thx
[08:04:56] <systemfault> You should always use var :)
[08:05:19] <toxz> i thought its like new xyz()
[08:05:29] <toxz> not for scoping
[08:05:45] <markj> toxz you can do this too though: var x = 'x', y = 'y', z = 'z'; no need to repeatedly type var
[08:05:58] <pouyt> SoulRaven: you here?
[08:06:28] <SoulRaven> yes
[08:06:37] <pouyt> this.checkValidity()
[08:06:45] <pouyt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917984/submit-a-html-5-form-with-ajax
[08:06:56] <SoulRaven> i have try, and is give trow an error
[08:07:27] <pouyt> works on opera
[08:07:58] <toxz> where do you hide you internal datas for elements in the html dom - as which elements or attributes. i know use hidden inputs or ids or classes. has anyone the "killer" approach for doing thisß
[08:08:00] <toxz> ?
[08:08:13] <SoulRaven> pouyt: but not in chrome
[08:08:38] <pouyt> SoulRaven: in chrome it does not fire the .submit event
[08:11:47] <markj> use .data toxz
[08:11:54] <AdvoWork> if ive got numerous tds (class="new_rows" with a specific id for each "new_row + an id (incremented number, e.g new_row_7  ive counted how many are based on $(".new_sort_row").length, but how can i get all those numbers? ie id want the 7
[08:11:57] <kmindi> markj: but there is no += which accepts percentage values right?
[08:12:01] <timing_> toxz: or just data-foo attrributes ?
[08:12:04] <pouyt> SoulRaven: 	$('#x input[type=submit]').click(function () {
[08:12:04] <pouyt> 	alert($(this).parent()[0].checkValidity());
[08:12:04] <pouyt>     return false;
[08:12:04] <pouyt> });
[08:12:10] <martin_____> hi, how do I run an ajax request when the page loads?
[08:12:34] <timing_> martin_____: inside $(document).ready(function(){})
[08:13:53] <SoulRaven> pouyt: this is my code
[08:13:53] <toxz> markj  - if i generate server side code i need to put attributes into the html to identify elements (i.e. IDs) so i dont have them in my .data!?
[08:13:53] <SoulRaven> http://jsbin.com/exuhu4/edit

[08:15:58] <timing_> martin_____: so far nothing :-)

[08:16:50] <akahn> I'm trying to append a link to the text() of an element, but what happens is only the URL gets added to the text, not the actual link.
[08:17:01] <akahn> here's the code http://pastie.org/2027780
[08:17:17] <pouyt> SoulRaven: gtg, make sure "this" is ref to the form, or just manually select the form
[08:17:25] <akahn> is there a better way to get the actual text that isn't get(0)?
[08:17:55] <martin_____> timing_: can I PM you the site's URL?
[08:18:29] <cerzi> is it possible to nest some kind of image carousel inside a jqueryUI modal dialog? how easy would it be to modify an image carousel plugin to allow the user to make a selection, which closes the modal and shows the selected image on the original page?
[08:20:12] <phlp> akahn: did you try commit.html(message);
[08:21:17] <akahn> phlp: hm, good idea. that seems to yield the same result though
[08:22:11] <akahn> i think the issue is with the get(0) call...
[08:22:29] <timing_> martin_____: why don't you use chrome debugger?
[08:22:30] <skyp3r> hi@ll
[08:22:46] <timing_> martin_____: I don't have time to solve this issue privately, sorry
[08:23:48] <martin_____> timing_: I don't have Chrome
[08:24:45] <martin_____> solved it
[08:25:08] <timing_> martin_____: nor firefox?

[08:26:13] <phlp> akahn: instead of get(0) try return $('<div/>').append(link).html();

[08:42:43] <tman> has anyone had a problem with ie7 links shifting slightly when clicked?
[08:42:51] <tman> using jquery to change colour inline but ...
[08:43:04] <tman> not sure why that would cause the position to change.
[08:43:32] <tman> only happens the first time u click the link, then it stays ( this is in an unordered list)
[08:44:11] <phlp> tman: are you using .css ?
[08:44:23] <samuelj> Does that question make sense?
[08:44:36] <tman> aye
[08:45:19] <phlp> samuelj: .live or .delegate
[08:45:42] <tman> ah fixex it
[08:45:49] <tman> was the opacity setting.
[08:46:14] <samuelj> phlp: so i dont need to use ready?
[08:47:31] <phlp> samuelj: you do. i meant to replace the click handler with one of those

[09:19:40] <phlp> CasW: never used it but seen this recently http://fittextjs.com
[09:20:23] <CasW> Oh, and don't you dare let us catch you using FitText on paragraph text. This is for gigantic display text only!
[09:20:38] <CasW> So it doesn't fit for me, although I'll check if it works

I dont know what numeric index the option has, only that its attribute value is "cars"..

[09:48:15] <binni> can I edit all ajax post and get that are sent so that there is addeed "/apps" to the front of the URL they are using?
[09:48:52] <binni> one command that sees to it that it's add to all post and get.
[09:48:57] <rns> anyone know why this is reloading the entire page still?  http://dpaste.com/551132/
[09:50:20] <Tidwell> rns: you're including jquery too, right?
[09:51:06] <Tidwell> rns: ohh, you forgot the opening { in your object literal your passing to .post
[09:51:16] <binni> found it, use ajaxSend and then settings["url"] = "/apps"+settings["url"];
[09:53:19] <Tidwell> rns: and if that is supposed to be an object literal, it needs keys - if its not and your just passing the 2 vals as arguments, then get rid of the closing }
[09:53:43] <systemfault> Heh... learn JS my friend.
[09:53:56] <shiftins> anyone here familiar with the flowplayer js api?
[09:54:28] <CasW> Does anyone know how to (simply) get the offset? The text outside of my div?
[09:54:33] <CasW> (Size of it)
[09:55:35] <Tidwell> CasW: not sure what you're asking... example?
[09:56:18] <CasW> Well, I have text, and I put it in a resizable div, but the text is larger than the div, so I want to resize that div
[09:56:39] <Vaerros> rns: you have some syntax errors there, but anyway, I think $.post is the culprit
[09:57:53] <RobW> http://jsfiddle.net/wpaflight/zRQ8z/ any ideas how to overcome scrolling when an iframe is present?
[09:58:01] <Vaerros> rns: whoops, ignore that
[09:58:07] <RobW> for example, if your mouse is over part of the facebook like, the jscrollpane doesn't work
[09:58:23] <Vaerros> rns: http://jsfiddle.net/ycFhE/3/ this seems to work
[09:59:00] <Tidwell> CasW: put the text inside of an element inside the div and get the size of that element - or put the text into some other element before putting it where you want and pull the size from that
[10:00:14] <rns> Vaerros, thanks for taking a look at this.  I tried that code, but it still seems to be reloading the entire page.
[10:01:40] <rns> Vaerros, wait, nevermind.  That code doesn't even submit anythign.  Just makes the save button greyed out
[10:02:49] <Tidwell> rns: here http://pastebin.com/bQB9LtL6
[10:03:37] <Tidwell> rns: you'll notice the culprit being the syntax errors in the call to $.post
[10:04:54] <rns> Tidwell, that just seems to make the save button greyed out now
[10:05:03] <maxhoy> Hi. Is there a good way to cycle between even and odd items when using jquery templates?
[10:05:19] <Tidwell> rns: look in console, its making the ajax request
[10:05:31] <Tidwell> rns: because you don't have an action defined on the form, its just posting to itself
[10:05:55] <RobW> http://jsfiddle.net/wpaflight/zRQ8z/ any ideas how to overcome scrolling when an iframe is present?
[10:05:56] <RobW> for example, if your mouse is over part of the facebook like, the jscrollpane doesn't work
[10:06:16] <rns> Tidwell, so what should I make it post to then?
[10:06:47] <Tidwell> rns: ... wherever you need the form to post to ...
[10:07:18] <rns> Tidwell, I need it to post to the same page, which is what I am doing for the non-ajax request....
[10:07:30] <astropirate> I have event handlers X, Y, Z registered for a given event (in that order). If X gets called first, how can it stop all of the other handlers from being called without actually unbinding them?

[10:14:11] <yanick> hi, if I'm binding .ajaxSuccess() do some element to have a global notification for each request, and the response is a JSON one, the $.post callback will receive the response as JSON object, but how can I get that response in the .ajaxSuccess callback?
[10:17:05] <Tidwell> yanick: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/  its about halfway down the page.  The second argument passed into the callback has .responseHTML or .responseXML

[10:28:25] <Tidwell> yanick: it does the same thing using responseHTML?
[10:28:28] <supsup> (css question) 1. http://jsfiddle.net/zPz6W/  2. click on a non-grey link (non-visited).  3. right click in Result window and click "Back" --until you click on the results window, the link does not have the visited style -- why?
[10:28:53] <systemfault> joshontheweb: On hover, start a timer (setTimeout) that at the end, it makes the thing appear and on mouseout, clear the timeout
[10:29:15] <MagusOTB> the checkboxes ghet labelles incorrectly and don't toggle like they should.
[10:29:22] <MagusOTB> *labelled
[10:29:48] <yanick> Tidwell, undefined as well. the response is JSON, not XML
[10:30:30] <yanick> Tidwell, I guess responseText is evaluated somewhere to pass it on to the request callback... but why isn't that information NOT available to the global callback?
[10:30:35] <ip-route> somebody use jqgrid ?

[10:38:33] <yanick> Tidwell, no problem, I'm trying to find out where the JSON data is actually set in the request's response

[10:47:52] <ogzy> at my web app i have div area which loads a canvas when the page is loaded, the canvas is not typed int html file but created during after processing some js files, it is creating a visualization, the canvas is like: <canvas widht="1280" height="350" style:"position: absolut;"> i want to remove the style property of the produced canvas, how can i do it?
[10:48:34] <wolfe> hmmms
[10:48:43] <wolfe> 900+ users here x.x
[10:48:50] <phlp> $('canvas').attr('style','')
[10:49:21] <wolfe> these psuedo selectors are nice :))
[10:49:35] <phlp> or .removeAttr('style')
[10:50:07] <ogzy> phlp: the thing is the canvas is producing after a while when the page is loaded, it is processing some json files and producing the graph, where should i process removeAttr, on page load?
[10:50:56] <stefancrs> anyone? how to avoid a submit-loop in a live submit-handler? :)
[10:51:14] <stefancrs> aha
[10:51:18] <stefancrs> die instead of unbind
[10:51:24] <RobW> anyone?
[10:51:30] <RobW> ....
[10:53:08] <Tidwell> RobW: The only recommendation i could find is to use full body scrolling when using an iframe on the iframed page... since you don't have control over that, i think you may be stuck trying to debug the plugin - does it do it with any generic iframe (i could only isolate it happening in your example when you scroll, then click off the scroll bar on one of the arrows)
[10:53:48] <RobW> Tidwell: yes happens for any iframe, see current issue here: http://36beta.com/web/36creative/blog/ (sidebar)
[10:53:52] <ogzy> phlp: mainly i want to remove style attrb right after the canvas element is created and loaded at the page?
[10:54:18] <RobW> Tidwell: body of page shouldn't scroll when your mouse is over FACEBOOK iframe (like or pictures), instead, that slider should scroll.
[10:54:34] <Draconisle> exit
[10:57:30] <phlp> ogzy: what is creating this canvas? your code?
[10:58:04] <ogzy> phlp: some js files indeed, i just use them, they are using json file format to create a visualiation
[10:58:50] <Tidwell> RobW: hrm :( so its probably a legit bug - you may have to dig into the plugin yourself and debug it - i personally think mucking with scrollbars is terrible for accessability, but have had to impliment it at designer's request - wish i could be more help
[11:01:01] <phlp> ogzy: just remove the style after calling the plugin or whatever it is
[11:01:20] <yanick> Tidwell, there is a fourth argument, not included in the documentation, containing the response
[11:02:02] <yanick> Tidwell, if the response is text, the 4th argument will be a string. For a JSON request, the 4th argument will be an object like { response: ... }
[11:02:29] <yanick> hrm.... the actual JSON object, because "response" is part of the server response
[11:02:40] <yanick> from my implementation
[11:03:00] <Tidwell> yanick: holy crap.  Talk about documentation fail...  good to know - may want to post that on the jquery api page so they can update it
[11:03:14] <yanick> yes, I should
[11:03:14] <CasW> I have a string, let's say "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.", and that string has to be in a resizable div, which has a max-width, is it possible to let the text automatically go on a new row?
[11:03:20] <CasW> (Sorry for the bad english)
[11:04:05] <CasW> So, an example:
[11:04:05] <CasW> | Lorum ipsum |
[11:04:05] <CasW> | dolor sit        |
[11:04:05] <CasW> | amet            |
[11:07:29] <ries> Hello! when doing a ajax request to a other domain, is it possible to retreive the response headers? even though the request goes to a other domain?
[11:10:06] <SumSigma> hey I am using jQuery inside of a .net updatepanel and trying to get the jQuery to persist inside of partial post backs.  Anyone have experience with this?  It 'almost' works when i use .live
[11:21:17] <geestring> if I have multiple divs with the the class "events," how do I iterate through all of them and fadeIn with a delay? so I want them to sequentially fadeIn
[11:30:26] <sunsys> Can $.ajax() do a cross domain request on IE7 ?

[11:35:11] <sunsys> I know that there is a crossDomain(added 1.5) , but not sure if that will work on IE7 ? Can anybody help
[11:35:48] <schz> hi everyone, i need some help. how can i write a selector for a option in a select dropdown with a specific value?
[11:36:56] <gnarf> schz: $('#selectId option[value="value"]') ?
[11:37:09] <gnarf> schz: to what purpose tho?
[11:37:15] <gnarf> why do you want to select that option?
[11:37:53] <schz> i want to disable it
[11:38:16] <schz> i think i was just missing the quores around value
[11:38:20] <schz> thank you gnarf
[11:38:55] <cbobo> if I am using the template language, type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"  and I have a variable that is an array how can I search though it but stop on a certion element?
[11:41:05] <schz> cbobo use .each() and then when you have the one you want you can exit out of the loop with return(true)
[11:44:31] <iateadonut> how do you set the onclick attribute with a css class?  i want all of the input buttons of a certain class to run a javascript function when clicked.   something like $('.classname').click(function); ?
[11:45:33] <Qantourisc> jamesarosen: sounds right
[11:45:52] <Woet> iateadonut: does that code you mentioned work?
[11:46:58] <iateadonut> no
[11:47:19] <iateadonut> nevermind, yes it does.
[11:47:19] <Qantourisc> iateadonut: is it online to view ?
[11:47:23] <Tidwell> iateadonut: are you inserting the inputs into the dom after that has been called?  if so you want to use .live
[11:47:23] <Qantourisc> iateadonut: a ok :)
[11:47:25] <Tidwell> lol
[11:48:15] <Woet> iateadonut: then you just answered your own question in the same sentence
[11:48:16] <thegozt> anyone know of a good jquery plugin for cookies?
[11:48:18] <Woet> :)
[11:48:26] <Woet> enjoy your donut
[11:48:33] <iateadonut> that was actually a suggestion from #javascript and they told me to ask in jquery.
[11:49:17] <systemfault> Heh.
[11:50:45] <yanick> is it possible to inject arguments in an ajax request through a global ajax event before the request is being sent?
[11:51:06] <Tidwell> thegozt: not sure why you would need a plugin.  Theres plenty of good one-off cookie examples in pure JS without resorting to tacking more shit onto the jquery namespace.  scroll down to the bottom here: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html
[11:51:09] <yanick> I'm trying to use .ajaxSend(), but modifying the options.data doesn't change anything
[11:52:05] <Woet> yanick: show me your code
[11:52:10] <schz> thanks for the help everyone
[11:53:33] <yanick> Woet, http://pastie.org/2028709    ... but the request does not send the modified data, only the original one
[11:54:16] <Woet> yanick: options.data is a global variable?
[11:54:36] <yanick> Woet, it's a function argument
[11:55:01] <yanick> Woet, the 3rd function argument of .ajaxSend
[11:57:13] <Woet> yanick: i've never used the ajaxSend/ajaxSuccess, so I won't be able to help you. I just use .ajax, .get, .post and .load
[11:59:09] <LakWork_> ajaxSend and ajaxSuccess are state handlers. You can globally subscribe to those events to trigger behaviors. For example, if you subscribed to ajaxSuccess at the document level you could have a success message render *any time* an ajax request completes anywhere on the page
[11:59:39] <LakWork_> @Woet
[12:00:09] <Woet> thanks LakWork_, i'll look into it
[12:00:31] <LakWork_> You bet
[12:01:02] <Lundy> heya guys, how can I get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/D3cTM/ wot time trying to do is when u click start ... it should set "start_date" as todays date and the end_date 30 days from today ...
[12:02:25] <Woet> Lundy: what if it's the 30th of june?
[12:02:31] <Woet> then your scripts will turn it into the 33th of june :)
[12:02:53] <Woet> wait, sorry - it will turn it into the 60th of june :
[12:03:04] <Lundy> well thats the problem ...
[12:03:26] <Lundy> it would need to add on 30 days, so like if its 30th June... 30 days from then is 29th July
[12:03:32] <phlp> http://www.datejs.com

[12:16:42] <jaequery> hi anyone here from jquery ui team?
[12:17:15] <ajpiano> jaequery: what's up
[12:18:02] <gnarf> jaequery: just ask the question? :)
[12:18:57] <sphinxxxx> anynone know a plugin similar to the one they use here for zoom? it seems to be very fast
[12:18:59] <sphinxxxx> http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/AD2022/
[12:19:01] <amid_hasan> can't make my photo gallery to work: http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/b9xTb/4/
[12:19:39] <cbobo> how do I apply the html for a value inside of a loop?
[12:20:07] <cbobo> Example: {{each tables}} <div id="${$value.id}">works fine</div> {{/each}}
[12:20:12] <Layke> Anyone know any plugin which can do something like this flash affect to images? http://www.lakecomovillas.net/
[12:20:14] <cbobo> however, how can i do something like this:
[12:20:27] <cbobo> <div id="${$value.id}">{{html value.rawdata}}</div>
[12:20:42] <Layke> Doesn't have to be identical, just some carousel with some image effect.
[12:21:36] <cbobo> {{html data}} maybe i should post that on the wiki eh
[12:23:18] <LakWork_> is anyone aware of an html-enabled markdown viewer? I want to be able to open .MD files
[12:23:29] <phlp> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/b9xTb/5
[12:23:45] <Jon47> Layke.. here are some neat css3 transitions, not supported by older browsers though: http://www.joelambert.co.uk/flux/transgallery.html
[12:23:59] <amid_hasan> phlp , thanks!!!
[12:25:06] <Layke> Jon47: Impressive.
[12:25:26] <amid_hasan> phlp: so to make multidimensional array (escentially an object), I would use { } around each set, and call the property with array.property?
[12:25:27] <MagusOTB> is there a way to delegate a given class to be autocomplete()'d?
[12:25:39] <MagusOTB> so that all elements of that class now and in the future become autocompletes
[12:26:00] <amid_hasan> phlp: thank you for removing my brain fart
[12:26:17] <Layke> Jon47: Does it have a noscript version? (As in, only show one image and don't rotate them)?
[12:26:19] <Jon47> MagusOTB.. you might be able to put the autocomplete initialization code into the "focus" event of those elements..
[12:26:22] <cody--> does something like this not work in IE7: $('.chart-query.selected input[name^=id]:checked').length
[12:26:40] <Layke> noscript as in less than CSS3 and no JS I guess.
[12:26:57] <MagusOTB> Jon47: Hmm. I'll try that. It wouldn't be too hard to make them autocompleted as they're created, it just seems cleaner to have it in one place.
[12:27:19] <Jon47> I'd recommend just doing it as they're created
[12:27:28] <Morkel> Is it possible to set an id to the "Send" Button in a .dialog? https://gist.github.com/1010897
[12:27:48] <Jon47> layke graceful degradation .. I dunno, it's not my page ;)
[12:28:06] <Jon47> but if you want fancy transitions, css3 is the way to go, you can't really do much without it
[12:29:03] <tbranyen> Jon47: yeah nobody has been doing transitions before it :-p
[12:33:13] <Chilaquiles> hey guys I have this click event that I wrote in my page http://pastebin.com/RisNLvpV
[12:33:53] <Chilaquiles> but how can I call a specific function on the page process.php so I can get true of false from that function and then based on that print a message?
[12:35:01] <cbobo> if I have a .click( function() { //stuff in here// });
[12:35:01] <cody--> Set your php page up to return json and set something like $return['complete'] = false
[12:35:13] <cbobo> can i view global variables inside of the //stuff in here// ?
[12:35:33] <Caraes_Naur> window.foo is always accessible
[12:35:43] <cody--> yes, if there declared as var blah = ""
[12:35:46] <MagusOTB> Does using jquery widget functions twice on something cause problems?
[12:35:57] <alaing> hi i'm trying to load in a script file using .getScript but the script is not being run
[12:36:22] <alaing> it finds the file and runs the success function
[12:36:42] <alaing> but the script in the file is not being run
[12:36:44] <MagusOTB> like, if use $('someselector').autocomplete() multiple times, will they stack and cause issues?
[12:38:51] <Tidwell> MagusOTB: depends on how the plugin is written - try it and find out
[12:39:01] <alaing> shouldn't .getScript run my function?
[12:39:35] <abjorn> qweries!
[12:39:49] <Chilaquiles> please help!!!
[12:39:54] <abjorn> sup?
[12:40:03] <alaing> wassup Chilaquiles ?
[12:40:54] <Chilaquiles> hey guys I have this click event that I wrote in my page http://pastebin.com/RisNLvpVh
[12:41:01] <Chilaquiles> sorry the link is wrong
[12:41:09] <Chilaquiles> http://pastebin.com/RisNLvpV
[12:41:40] <Chilaquiles> and then I want to call a specific function from the page process.php, how can I do that?
[12:42:22] <alaing> Chilaquiles: what i normally do is pass in a "flag"
[12:42:47] <Chilaquiles> how is that?
[12:42:52] <alaing> so on in my form I set a hidden item with a value
[12:43:11] <alaing> i then have an if statement to see what the value was
[12:43:34] <alaing> there maybe a better way
[12:43:58] <Chilaquiles> Do I have to have a form?
[12:44:14] <alaing> No
[12:44:48] <alaing> what is $('#textbox')?
[12:45:01] <alaing> a text field?
[12:46:08] <Chilaquiles> yep
[12:46:30] <Chilaquiles> I have a button and an text field
[12:46:37] <alaing> which is within a form?
[12:46:43] <Chilaquiles> when I click the button I want to process what I have in the text field
[12:47:01] <alaing> sure not a problem i understand what you trying to do
[12:47:07] <Chilaquiles> ok
[12:47:12] <Chilaquiles> Do you want to see my whole code?
[12:47:28] <alaing> would be an idea
[12:47:36] <alaing> :)
[12:48:36] <alaing> try jsfiddle.net
[12:48:43] <Chilaquiles> I hope you can understand it
[12:48:56] <Chilaquiles> because I have php and html
[12:49:15] <alaing> just show me the html for the moment
[12:49:36] <alaing> so i can see your structure

[12:51:37] <dereknelson01> Hello I am not sure if there is any discussions going on but can anyone help me with a jsonp request
[12:53:06] <alaing> Chilaquiles: hmm quiet tricky
[12:53:31] <alaing> by looking at you code your html looks malformed
[12:53:32] <Chilaquiles> I know
[12:53:42] <Chilaquiles> why?
[12:53:58] <alaing> your input/text fields should be within a form element
[12:55:44] <alaing> basic form http://jsfiddle.net/SwqyC/1/
[12:56:24] <alaing> if the js is disabled or fails it should still submit your page and process it accordingly
[12:57:22] <Chilaquiles> let me check that
[12:57:26] <dereknelson01> Well if anyone can help I have never done jsonp before and this is the page I am working on: http://nelson54.github.com/FlashDB/
[12:57:53] <cbobo> Is there any way to do something like
[12:57:59] <dereknelson01> I am using google app engine to generate the jsonp feed that I am requesting
[12:58:00] <cbobo> {{if data == "first"}} ?
[12:58:07] <Chilaquiles> isn't method=POST?
[12:58:09] <alaing> if you worried about security then use POST but it also allows you to send more data to your server
[12:58:16] <Chilaquiles> ok
[12:58:29] <alaing> Get just adds the data to the url
[12:58:37] <Chilaquiles> let me show you my second version
[12:59:02] <Chilaquiles> http://jsfiddle.net/SwqyC/2/
[12:59:05] <Chilaquiles> chech it out
[12:59:08] <Chilaquiles> check

[13:02:18] <sacrebleu> how do I send a javascript object as json in a single URL variable via the data: of an $.ajax?
[13:02:22] <Chilaquiles> djQuery: is not doing what I want so that's why I'm asking for help
[13:02:42] <gnarf> sacrebleu: you need to use JSON.stringify()
[13:02:49] <systemfault> Hmm
[13:02:51] <sacrebleu> is that part of jQuery?
[13:02:56] <alaing> Chilaquiles: i notices you not using a valid doctype
[13:02:59] <gnarf> sacrebleu: nope, part of JSON2.js
[13:03:06] <gnarf> also builtin in "newer" browsers
[13:03:20] <Chilaquiles> alaing: is that important for what I wanna do?
[13:03:21] <systemfault> gnarf: Why the hell doesn't jquery have a stringify? :(
[13:03:26] <sacrebleu> gnarf: should I escape it too?
[13:03:33] <gnarf> systemfault: because jQuery doesn't need stringify
[13:03:40] <sacrebleu> systemfault: it has a get not a stringify, stupid (it is)
[13:03:49] <systemfault> sacrebleu: I saw :(
[13:03:51] <gnarf> sacrebleu: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[13:03:55] <systemfault> It is stupid..
[13:03:59] <alaing> Chilaquiles: no but it can cause all sorts of issues if you start using some plugins that require a specific doctype
[13:04:02] <gnarf> sacrebleu: you don't need to escape
[13:04:19] <alaing> Chilaquiles: do you know how to process POST in php?
[13:04:40] <gnarf> sacrebleu: if you're using $.ajax it will escape it
[13:04:49] <Chilaquiles> alaing: sort of
[13:04:50] <gnarf> systemfault: what does jQuery need stringify for?
[13:05:14] <gnarf> the "parseJSON" only exists because we need it
[13:05:20] <brugby> Ive got some weird recursion bug that is occurring. Any help would be appreciated: http://pastie.org/2029020
[13:05:34] <systemfault> gnarf: To send JSON via ajax? Why does jQuery did half the job (parseJSON) and can't provide a stringify.
[13:05:37] <alaing> Chilaquiles: ok seeing as you want to post rather then GET you neeed to tell jquery the method
[13:05:52] <gnarf> systemfault: because there is already https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js ?
[13:05:54] <systemfault> gnarf: The biggest advantage of jQuery is how nicely it abstract DOM problems.
[13:06:11] <systemfault> gnarf: Then remove parseJSON... if I follow your logic.
[13:06:18] <gnarf> systemfault: we NEED parseJSON
[13:06:20] <gnarf> so we have it
[13:06:27] <gnarf> we use it for a lot of things
[13:06:32] <gnarf> data-* attribs
[13:06:33] <gnarf> ajax
[13:06:35] <gnarf> etc
[13:06:49] <Chilaquiles> alaing: but thats what I did in version 2
[13:06:51] <gnarf> we don't want to increase the size of the library for stringify
[13:07:00] <gnarf> since if you need it, https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js already exists
[13:07:26] <remysharp> anyone tell me the difference between deferred.always and deferred.then?
[13:07:47] <gnarf> remysharp: always runs for either fail or resolve
[13:07:56] <alaing> hye remysharp just like to say i luv your podcasts
[13:07:58] <gnarf> remysharp: then is (resolveCallbacks, thenCallbacks)
[13:08:26] <brugby> the size shows as 1, but yet its occurring 200+ times for some crazy reason.
[13:08:32] <remysharp> gnarf: cheers.
[13:08:36] <alaing> Chilaquiles: no you didn't you just added it in the html
[13:08:43] <gnarf> remysharp: .always( fn ) == .then( fn, fn )

[13:11:25] <Chilaquiles> ok thanks
[13:13:01] <brugby> im so confused.
[13:14:37] <dereknelson01> Is there like a #jquery-support channel?
[13:15:05] <swiggy> is it possible to take a div and its contents, and use appendTo to move it into another div
[13:15:19] <swiggy> example: $('#divcontent').appendTo('#divcontent2');

[13:15:25] <Chilaquiles> ok
[13:19:13] <rns> I am using variables in my URL which are requured to figure out what record in the DB to update.  How would I pass this in via ajax?

[13:19:44] <ccmonster> can someone help me with my issue. This function is getting fired hundreds of times and it makes no sense why to me.
[13:19:54] <ccmonster> Any help would be appreciated: http://pastie.org/2029020
[13:19:54] <alaing_> look at $.ajax part and the hidden element i placed after your text field
[13:22:25] <alaing_> ccmonster: events maybe bubbling
[13:22:38] <ccmonster> yea, e.stopPropagation();?
[13:22:45] <Chilaquiles> alaing: what is this .serialise()?
[13:23:08] <ccmonster> takes elements in a form and serializes them into an array for posting/getting etc
[13:23:57] <alaing_> Chilaquiles: sorry typo it should be serialize
[13:24:16] <Chilaquiles> what is that?
[13:24:27] <alaing_> then in your process.php you should be able to pick it up using $_POST('flag')
[13:24:59] <alaing_> takes all the values and serializes it to send to your server
[13:25:10] <ccmonster> its based on the name of the form elements though, not the id/classes
[13:25:18] <alaing_> ?serialize @ Chilaquiles
[13:25:19] <ccmonster> key = form.element.name
[13:25:26] <ccmonster> value = form.element.value
[13:25:31] <ccmonster> for a basic understanding
[13:25:53] <alaing_> hmm no bot
[13:25:57] <Chilaquiles> alaing: is doing the same thing
[13:26:00] <Chilaquiles> :(
[13:26:01] <ccmonster> jesus, i dont get how this event is firing so much. wtf.
[13:26:27] <alaing_> ccmonster: could you try and delegate the event?
[13:26:52] <alaing_> Chilaquiles: do you have firefox with firebug plugin?
[13:26:54] <ccmonster> what you mean?
[13:27:14] <Chilaquiles> alaing: No, Im looking at the Chrome debugger
[13:27:38] <Chilaquiles> alaing: and there are no differences with your code and my code
[13:27:44] <alaing_> ccmonster: .delegate?
[13:27:56] <ccmonster> im not sure what delegate will do for me
[13:28:15] <alaing_> instead of binding click events to all the a you simply place it in a parent contain
[13:28:47] <alaing_> ccmonster: hold on
[13:29:10] <ccmonster> k
[13:29:38] <rns> when you hijack a form's post submission with ajax, does the post data still submit with the same name as the original form?
[13:30:02] <ccmonster> isnt delegate essentially bind/live?
[13:30:20] <snover> in the same way that $ is essentially getElementById
[13:30:41] <alaing_> ccmonster kind of
[13:30:52] <ccmonster> not entirely sure in this case what the advantage is...
[13:31:07] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2029020
[13:31:18] <ccmonster> basically, when i console out in the call, it shows one event.
[13:31:54] <ccmonster> when i console out in the 'does the stuff' portion, firebug locks up for a seconds and gives me a recursion issue,
[13:32:30] <Chilaquiles> alaing_: Am I doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/SwqyC/5/
[13:32:48] <alaing_> ok take for example on line 2 of your example searcher.element.children('li').children('h2').children('span').click(function(e){
[13:32:50] <Chilaquiles> alaing_: It seems like is not posting what it suppose to
[13:33:41] <ccmonster> ...ok
[13:34:21] <ccmonster> what about it?
[13:34:52] <samuelj> Hey, I'm trying to insert a open ended form tag to an <li> with .prepend, but it's closing the form tag? And i can't quite figure out why. Something I'm missing?
[13:34:53] <alaing_> you could use delegate on searcher.element,delegate("li h2 span","click",function(e){
[13:35:06] <amid_hasan> how do I identify current position in array and display it inside an element?
[13:35:27] <ccmonster> and what would the advantage be here?
[13:35:29] <amid_hasan> if display.data("count",i); i is the position
[13:35:53] <alaing_> ccmonster: you not binding click events to each span and having to search through the dom
[13:36:02] <ccmonster> ah.
[13:36:11] <alaing_> Chilaquiles: what does the console logigng?
[13:36:14] <ccmonster> so more efficient from a traversal standpoint?
[13:36:20] <alaing_> yes
[13:36:35] <alaing_> I normally use delegate in place of .love
[13:36:38] <alaing_> .live
[13:37:00] <amid_hasan> nevermind, figured it out
[13:37:28] <alaing_> because .live  the event does right through your dom where .delegate places a listener on a particluar element so the event bubbles up to that top element without going through the rest of the dom
[13:37:43] <ccmonster> oknoway, the bubbling or refiring issue is still occurring
[13:37:56] <alaing_> and you cna add as maynew elements as you like
[13:38:00] <ccmonster> it really confuses me
[13:38:20] <alaing_> ccmonster: can you get a working demo?
[13:38:28] <ccmonster> hmm...uh possibly yea.
[13:38:35] <samuelj> any ideas anyone?
[13:39:51] <alaing_> ccmonster: do you use firefox with firebug?
[13:41:04] <ccmonster> yeap. sure do
[13:41:21] <alaing_> ccmonster: do you have firequery?
[13:41:53] <ccmonster> nope. i dont think so.
[13:41:58] <ccmonster> i can snag it really quick
[13:43:12] <alaing_> ccmonster: you should its a great add on. it can inject jquery into an webpage with a single click of a button and it shows you and bind events/
[13:43:21] <alaing_> or .data added to elements
[13:43:34] <ccmonster> nice nice.
[13:43:38] <ccmonster> ok hold on. just installed firequery
[13:43:49] <ccmonster> even still, need to figure out what is re-firing or why
[13:43:49] <alaing_> lets just say i never leave home without those three babies on my machine
[13:44:09] <alaing_> ccmonster can you setup a demo?
[13:44:28] <ccmonster> i am doing that
[13:46:00] <alaing_> Chilaquiles: what is it posting?
[13:46:17] <Chilaquiles> username not registered
[13:46:21] <cmmagid> In the spirit of XPath.  Is there a way (preferably in ff) to find the jQuery selector when the focus is in the field I want to find the selector for?
[13:47:35] <cmmagid> In other words.   I want to find the selector for the thing I have my cursor on.
[13:48:13] <cmmagid> Sorry for the noob question.   I hope this list is ok for noobs
[13:48:56] <GoGoGarrett>  :selected / :focued? maybe i'm not sure exaclty
[13:49:07] <pootpoot> :hover ?
[13:49:14] <alaing_> cmmagid: $(":text").focus(function(){console.log(this)})
[13:49:24] <phlp> $(':focus') works but is not recommended by the docs, $(document.activeElement) is http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector
[13:49:49] <gnarf> I think I added that recommendation... ;)
[13:50:12] <phlp> nice work :)
[13:50:12] <newuser> hi all , does jquery have something like extractScripts ? like prototype does? i need it to parse some embedded javascript in html that i receive with an jquery ajax call
[13:50:49] <CasW> In what sense?
[13:51:09] <alaing_> .getScripts? @ newuser
[13:52:07] <cmmagid> Thank you alaing_: seeking clarification.  What does :text refer to.  It looks like a selector
[13:52:34] <alaing_> :text relates to text fields ie input type="text"
[13:52:44] <newuser> alaing, well if i understand getScript takes an url as a parameter, i allready have the data in the success:function (data) {} in my ajax call, how can i parse the embedded javascript in that
[13:52:50] <alaing_> :select for select lists
[13:53:47] <alaing_> newuser: so your data is simply script text or a full html page?
[13:54:48] <alaing_> cmmagid: this might help http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:55:19] <ccmonster> oknoway, so replicating this in fiddle is a PITA
[13:55:20] <newuser> alaing, it's part of an html page and has embedded javascript, it's just a table with some select, and in the onchange i have some javascript callback that jquery doesn't parse
[13:55:37] <newuser> alaing, it's not a full <html></html> page
[13:56:36] <alaing_> newuser: getScript should run the code then
[13:56:50] <ccmonster> oknoway, alaing_ , here is my fiddle but it doesnt appear you can trigger dialog in fiddle?
[13:56:58] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/FuJe7/
[13:57:18] <alaing_> newuser: actually just change the datatype to script and it should run the script
[13:59:08] <newuser> alaing, if i change the datatype to script it won't parse ok the html .. so i have it set to html. any other options?
[14:00:08] <ccmonster> alaing, here is a modified version. It's not identical to the pastie, but it should deliver the gist. http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/FuJe7/3/
[14:00:14] <alaing_> newuser: stick the script into its own external file?
[14:00:27] <newuser> alaing, this page i'm working on it's really messed up, it get's composed by lots of ajax calls so i don't believe it's valid html at all, but with prototype they seem to work it out, that's why i was wondering
[14:01:41] <newuser> alaing, i read that if you make an ajax call with jquery, it automatically evaluates the embedded javascript, so no need to extract it and evaluate it by hand. is it true?
[14:02:06] <xsamurai> i know the syntax is wrong http://jsfiddle.net/FZr95/ , how would i write this so i get the expected results of showing html in an alert box
[14:02:54] <rns> how do I detect all forms on the page with a single line?  Something like var form = $("#basicForm"); but abstracted for any form submitted?
[14:03:49] <shesek> xsamurai, are you serious? oO
[14:04:05] <ccmonster> rns = $('form')
[14:04:11] <ccmonster> it will return an array of all the forms
[14:05:00] <rns> ccmonster, so will that make this ajax work for any form submitted on the page (instead of the specific basicForm)? http://dpaste.com/551218/
[14:05:22] * abjorn hugs bot-t
[14:05:33] <abjorn> nooo bot-t is missing again :(
[14:06:02] <ngharo> :'(
[14:06:10] <Tidwell> xsamurai: alerts don't work that way.  If you want html in a modal-esque overlay, you're going to have to create it yourself
[14:06:29] <Guest69494> what's wrong with that ? http://pastebin.com/3HETZ2Wn Iam using clone and effects are apply on the same element :/
[14:06:46] <Socrattes> Where can I look for the javascript libraries automatically registered by wordpress?
[14:06:47] <ccmonster> rns, no.
[14:07:04] <xsamurai> Tidwell: thats disappointing , i assumed it was basic to have html content in alert box
[14:07:29] <xsamurai> i can use color box or the like to display html content
[14:07:36] <phlp> ccmonster the error is caused by the append where you call build_feedback_select, you are passing the feedback object then doing an each on it. i'm guessing you wanted config.feedback_options?
[14:07:41] <systemfault> xsamurai: Pretty much nobody use alert/prompt/confirm anymore..
[14:07:46] <rns> ccmonster, how would I achieve that result/
[14:07:57] <ccmonster> hmm phlp ....im looking.
[14:08:12] <alaing_> phlp: i was just about to say that lol
[14:08:14] <ccmonster> what line phlp ...
[14:08:17] <Guest69494> http://pastebin.com/RruP5z4J i do not understand why with clone, differents effects applied on the same elements instead of differents elements
[14:08:23] <xsamurai> systemfault: except for spam sites with Nigerian bankers promising 5million
[14:08:29] <systemfault> :D
[14:08:30] <phlp> ccmonster: 19 here http://pastie.org/2029020
[14:09:21] <ccmonster> ahhhh isssh!
[14:09:31] <ccmonster> my eyes! how dare i miss such a simple typo.
[14:09:33] <ccmonster> muchas gracias
[14:09:39] <phlp> :)
[14:10:51] <alaing_> ccmonster: easily done
[14:11:08] <alaing_> time for some slepe
[14:11:12] <alaing_> sleep
[14:11:25] <alaing_> see ya peeps
[14:11:34] <ccmonster> thanks both of ya :0
[14:12:08] <ccmonster> acutally quick q, how do i put the array in feedback_options? it doesnt populate right
[14:12:48] <ccmonster> drr, just remove the dbl quotes. my fault.
[14:13:04] <alaing_> no probs
[14:13:19] * alaing_ is shutting down slowly
[14:14:01] <Edler> hey guys, what does this error mean: Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new d.fn.init(a,b,g)} has no method 'handleError'
[14:14:08] <Edler> ? handleError
[14:14:33] <rns> anyone know how to get this ajax to work for any form submitted?  http://dpaste.com/551218/
[14:16:41] <Edler> anyone help
[14:16:53] <Edler> handleError isn't present in the current jquery but was present in like jquery 1.2
[14:16:58] <Edler> anyone has any info on that ?
[14:19:09] <centr0> rns: use .each() and iterate over the form elements binding .submit()
[14:19:35] <ngharo> Edler: try using an uncompressed jquery
[14:20:21] <rns> centr0, so hard code in the form names?
[14:22:53] <centr0> rns: $('form').each(function() { this.submit(function() { ... });});
[14:24:37] <rns> centr0, I'm not sure I understand.  Are you able to to modify this?  http://dpaste.com/551218/
[14:25:02] <Edler2> ngharo: there ?
[14:25:49] <p3sho_> hi guys! for some reason, $(".QuestionText", "#" + questionId) fails on IE8 with: Object doesn't support property or method 'getElementsByTagName'
[14:26:01] <p3sho_> any hint on what might be causing that and how to fix it
[14:26:10] <p3sho_> using jquery 1.5.2
[14:26:25] <ngharo> Edler2: ?
[14:27:30] <p3sho_> strange thing is, it works on IE7 and IE9
[14:27:34] <p3sho_> but not IE8
[14:27:37] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2029432
[14:27:44] <ccmonster> rns : http://pastie.org/2029432
[14:28:16] <gnarf> p3sho_: can you make a fiddle?
[14:28:22] <Monstroplante> I all, can someone tell me why is fail: $.each(['a'], function(){$('<a/>').text(this).appendTo('body');});
[14:28:25] <gnarf> and test on jQuery 1.6?
[14:28:49] <ngharo> gnarf: doesn't his second argument need to be an element or jq object?
[14:29:21] <gnarf> ngharo: good point - not sure if that works with selectors
[14:29:22] <p3sho_> gnarf: what's a fiddle?
[14:29:31] <Zerxer> I think it does work with selectors
[14:29:34] <Zerxer> at least on the later versions
[14:29:43] <p3sho_> I tried with element, but let me try a jq element
[14:29:45] <Zerxer> ?context
[14:29:46] <gnarf> jsfiddle.net
[14:29:49] <Zerxer> oh yea
[14:29:51] <Zerxer> no bot-t
[14:29:51] <Zerxer> :(
[14:29:53] <ccmonster> $.each(obj,function(i,item){ $('<a/>').text($(this).text().appendTo('body'); })
[14:29:55] <p3sho_> and I also tested on 1.6
[14:29:59] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery
[14:30:13] <gnarf> "contextA DOM Element, Document, or jQuery to use as context"
[14:30:16] <ccmonster> oops, typo, but that should give you the gist
[14:31:32] <Zerxer> gnarf: works for me with a selector, just tested
[14:31:46] <Monstroplante> $.each(['a'], function(){console.debug(this);});
[14:31:55] <necromancer> is there anything better than Jcrop for image cropping nowadays? Jcrop hasn't been updated since 2009...
[14:32:06] <Monstroplante> 'this' is the current element...
[14:32:15] <Monstroplante> so, this is a string
[14:32:23] <rns> ccmonster, hmm that seems to make the entire page reload
[14:32:24] <Edler2> guys whats's the best ajax (iframe) image upload plugin for jquery
[14:32:24] <Edler2> ?
[14:32:33] <Monstroplante> so $('<a/>').text(this) shoud return a jquery object
[14:33:06] <Monstroplante> but $.each(['a'], function(){$('<a/>').text(this).appendTo('body');}); fail
[14:34:44] <ajpiano> Monstroplante: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide29
[14:35:03] <ajpiano> check the code example there, i think it's the problem you're having
[14:35:38] <rns> anyone know how to get this ajax to work for any form submitted?  http://dpaste.com/551218/
[14:35:51] <necromancer> Edler2: i use SWFupload
[14:36:51] <necromancer> Edler2: i'm sorry not swfupload, jquery.form - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[14:37:00] <necromancer> i use swfupload for multiple files
[14:37:10] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2029432
[14:37:21] <ccmonster> the preventDefault should be before the post is all
[14:37:49] <ccmonster> hola ajpiano  ltns
[14:39:45] <ajpiano> hiya
[14:40:01] <ccmonster> quick way to take an obj and push it via ajax param?
[14:40:14] <ajpiano> $.param(obj)
[14:40:34] <cbobo> is this jq valid?
[14:40:36] <p3sho_> ok, this sucks, it works isolated in the fiddle, but doesn't work on the site...
[14:40:47] <cbobo> $('#dialogmsg > #items').hide(); ?
[14:40:49] <rns> ccmonster, still is reloading the page...any ideas?
[14:40:52] <p3sho_> and it fails exactly on that line and only on IE8 :/
[14:40:52] <ccmonster> so in the data: $.param(myobj) will pass correctly?
[14:41:03] <ccmonster> console.log() your stuf to figure out whats up
[14:41:04] <snover> cbobo: it’s valid but it’s also the stupidest selector ever
[14:41:07] <ajpiano> ccmonster, you should just be able to pass the object as data directly
[14:41:14] <snover> if you want to select #items, select #items
[14:41:21] <snover> there can be only one
[14:41:22] <gnarf> snover: :)
[14:41:28] <ccmonster> ah.
[14:41:32] <cbobo> ya well, there are two
[14:41:33] <ccmonster> figured i would have to do some more mess.
[14:41:38] <cbobo> cuz the guy before be fucked up
[14:41:40] <centr0> rns: http://pastie.org/2029496
[14:41:46] <centr0> try that.
[14:42:21] <ccmonster> and if i want to throw some more into the obj, a quick $.param($.extend(obj,obj2beadded)) will do it?
[14:42:42] <necromancer> anybody here use Jcrop? what does the minSize setting do?
[14:42:42] <ajpiano> again
[14:42:43] <snover> cbobo: you can NOT have more than one element with the same id
[14:42:47] <ajpiano> you can just pass the result of extend
[14:42:52] <ajpiano> to the data argument
[14:42:55] <ccmonster> ah. drrr
[14:42:56] <ccmonster> my bad
[14:43:20] <ccmonster> apparently i such at comprehension. read it, just didnt sink in :|
[14:43:21] <ccmonster> lol
[14:44:10] <rns> centr0, that makes the page reload in an infinite loop = )
[14:51:13] <mafoo_> is there a toggle event type for delegate
[14:52:17] <mafoo_> or should i use click and put an if()  .. else statment inside
[14:55:12] <danheberden> mafoo_ you need to track your 'toggle' on your own in that case
[14:55:23] <mafoo_> yeh
[14:55:25] <mafoo_> thought so
[14:55:27] <mafoo_> oh well
[14:58:50] <rns> anyone know how to get this ajax to work for any form submitted?  http://dpaste.com/551218/
[15:00:03] <Rahly> i wonder why people even use forms when they ajax anymore
[15:00:24] <Jayflux> nothing wrong with using forms along with ajax
[15:01:13] <d4rklit3> why isn't there a asfiddle.net
[15:01:16] <Rahly> actually, there kinda is, its like reinventing the wheel, esp if you are just going to cancel the submit
[15:01:34] <Jayflux> so what you do instead Rahly
[15:01:46] <Rahly> just ajax, and skip the form
[15:01:51] <Jayflux> you still need to build the form
[15:01:55] <Rahly> if i use the form, i use the submit
[15:02:02] <Rahly> no
[15:02:17] <Rahly> you can have inputs without forms
[15:02:22] <ngharo> $(form).serialize() is one reason too, backwards compatibility is another
[15:02:22] <Jayflux> you talking about just having inputs?
[15:03:18] <Jayflux> but then serializing won't work will it Rahly
[15:03:25] <Jayflux> or itl be more of a hassle
[15:03:40] <ajpiano> Rahly: just because you can doesn't make it valid or a good idea
[15:03:46] <ajpiano> just because ajax exists doesn't mean you shouldn't use form tags
[15:03:52] <Jayflux> ^^
[15:05:09] <Rahly> i don't use serializing anymore
[15:05:25] <Jayflux> well if you did it would be easier to retain the form element
[15:05:53] <ajpiano> Rahly: you just manually construct data objects from form elements that aren't inside of forms?
[15:06:27] <rns> can I use .each with hardcoded form names to get this ajax to work for any form submitted?  http://dpaste.com/551218/
[15:06:41] <Rahly> i construct the post objects, but its an easy one liner
[15:07:05] <ajpiano> congrats
[15:07:07] <Jayflux> should work yeah rns
[15:07:09] <Rahly> i don't use the standard post methods anymore
[15:07:18] <ajpiano> dude you are just on another plane
[15:07:25] <GoGoGarrett> I broke all my code! :[
[15:07:40] <Rahly> i think posting json objects and getting json back seems more elegant
[15:08:11] <ajpiano> getting json back is elegant, sending json instead of using standard form paradigms is less than elegant
[15:08:28] <ajpiano> the form submit event is a very useful thing
[15:08:28] <cmmagid> thanks alaing_:  brilliant I am finally getting it.  Thank you!
[15:08:39] <ajpiano> and also it's technically invalid to have inputs that aren't inside of forms
[15:09:31] <Rahly> i like being able to send complex data structures rather than key/value pairs
[15:10:04] <ajpiano> it's useful, for sure, i've sent plenty of json in my day
[15:10:21] <ajpiano> and it's perfectly legitimate to use $.ajax outside of a form
[15:10:37] <d4rklit3> can i use jquery for <option> tags
[15:10:39] <ajpiano> but it is just silly to use input elements not inside of forms because of that
[15:10:45] <d4rklit3> to create dynamic dropboxes
[15:11:00] <danheberden> and i hate when sites don't use a form tag and my enter key does jack shit
[15:11:10] <Jayflux> ^^^
[15:11:10] <ajpiano> that too
[15:11:16] <Edler2> anyone knows any ajax image upload jquery plugin ?
[15:11:16] <Jayflux> another reason to keep the form element
[15:11:18] <ajpiano> exactly, form submit is an ideal time to do validation, etc.
[15:11:24] <danheberden> like, once i murdered a family of puppies it made me so mad
[15:11:39] <phlp> you animal
[15:14:11] <d4rklit3> hello?
[15:14:47] <rns> Jayflux, like this?  http://dpaste.com/551246/

[15:38:36] <MindSpark> hi, can someone tell me why $.post is not working on ie ?
[15:39:00] <Rahly> it probably works
[15:39:23] <MindSpark> Rahly, it's working on everything else except ie
[15:39:27] <MindSpark> the callback is not called
[15:39:59] <Rahly> i'd say its failing for some reason... whats the error callback give you?
[15:40:16] <MindSpark> I added the following line, now it calls the callback, but the request itself is not called
[15:40:16] <MindSpark> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" />
[15:40:26] <MindSpark> Rahly, there's no error
[15:40:53] <Rahly> well you can replace the post with the equiv .ajax, and set an error
[15:41:52] <MindSpark> Rahly, is the data parameter sent to the error function the actual error ? I tried to alert data, but even that is not working
[15:41:53] <mbroadst> any ideas?
[15:41:59] <MindSpark> nothing happens
[15:42:08] <sic1> ?: If you do a $el.one( 'load error', function( e ) { // if e.type error or load } ); it unbinds BOTH handlers...its not like a one of each right?
[15:42:36] <sic1> it unbinds both handlers when either of those events are triggered i mean
[15:42:44] <sic1> correct?
[15:44:51] <MindSpark> anyone?
[15:44:57] <Rahly> nothing about that does unbinding
[15:45:30] <Rahly> not sure what the error is, MindSpark... IE should tell you
[15:46:07] <ryanneufeld> anyone know of a jquery plugin that can sort the elements of a table with out the user drag&drop?
[15:46:23] <MindSpark> Rahly, what do I code the error() method to do/?
[15:46:27] <Deciphered> Does anyone know of any CDN'd lightboxes or similar? Looking from something for purely demonstrational purposes
[15:47:31] <Rahly> console.log? see whats in the developer tools?
[15:47:57] <del> hi
[15:48:11] <del> i am new to jquery need some help

[15:49:22] <del> the link only shows how to use but where i can download the plugin
[15:49:31] <BrandonZacharie> arg... i meant the one callback would be called for both events once

[16:41:20] <ericmuyser> using the twitter api and retweet text is being cut off because it adds "RT @name" to the beginning of the text. anybody know the fix? same problem as http://trac.adium.im/ticket/13550
[16:45:54] <LakWork_> ericmuyser this doesnt seem like a bug to me
[16:46:23] <bksf> lol
[16:50:09] <ericmuyser> LakWork_: well, it's kind of dumb. it cuts off the actual 140 tweet and prefixes it with an RT @name that wasn't present in the tweet. cuts off URLs in the tweet. problematic. asking in @twitterapi. http://bit.ly/mNNum9
[17:04:17] <donssp> i guys , im begginer in javascript and jquery, i have a menu, when i pass the mouse over the option "Representadas" the div #sub_menu is displayed, but when i do the mouseout event this layer is hideden, i would like to pass the cursor over the #sub_menu, and only when i move the cursor out of the layer #sub_menu and the opt "Representadas" the #sub_menu is hidden
[17:04:26] <donssp> http://jsfiddle.net/RXDrx/
[17:08:21] <donssp> sorry about my bad english hehe , can someone help me ?
[17:09:28] <BrandonZacharie> im on it right now
[17:10:11] <BrandonZacharie> a quick fix would be to use setTimeout and make sure you bind the the #sub_menu element on mouseover
[17:10:32] <BrandonZacharie> give me a second to demonstrate
[17:12:18] <ericmuyser> nvm fixed using tweet.retweet_status.text
[17:13:29] <donssp> ok , thankx
[17:18:42] <BrandonZacharie> http://jsfiddle.net/RXDrx/2/
[17:19:09] <BrandonZacharie> its sloppy but you'll get the point
[17:20:37] <BrandonZacharie> you need to bind to the sub  menu also so that it doesnt close when move your mouse from the menu to the sub menu
[17:21:21] <BrandonZacharie> plz excuse me engrish
[17:25:02] <donssp> you got , thanks so much , now i´ll study your script hehehe, thanks man ^^

[18:08:05] <Edler> guys please someone help
[18:08:18] <Edler> all i want is a lightweight small ajax module to upload an image in jquery
[18:08:20] <davehimself> Edler: what's teh issue?
[18:08:34] <Edler> i've tried like 5 ajax file upload modules so far
[18:08:39] <Edler> and every one of them has given up on me
[18:08:50] <Edler> i want one that works and is very light and easy to integrate
[18:08:52] <Edler> any suggestions
[18:08:53] <Edler> ?
[18:09:28] <davehimself> i've not worked with any
[18:09:36] <Edler> :(
[18:09:45] <Edler> one of them crashed because in the ne jquery
[18:09:47] <Edler> new*
[18:09:55] <Edler> jQuery.handleError doesn't exist
[18:10:00] <Edler> but exists in jquery 1.2.1
[18:17:19] <jethrot> how can I figure out the type of this?
[18:17:26] <jethrot> ie is a table row, or a td, or a table or a div..
[18:17:39] <iszak> this.tagName
[18:17:45] <iszak> this.is('tr')
[18:17:50] <iszak> or $(this).is('tr')
[18:18:07] <djQuery> why doesnt the item come to the top via z-index when clicking on it. http://jsbin.com/aboma3/3/edit
[18:18:33] <djQuery> Click on customers and drag it. it should be on top of orders at that point
[18:18:55] <bssleyahu> guess its a question better suit for Stack Overflow...
[18:19:44] <djQuery> there is also type
[18:19:48] <iszak> djQuery, because they're both got the same z-index
[18:20:35] <djQuery> iszak: I set all of them to have a z-index of 2 then set the clicked item to have a z-index of 3
[18:21:01] <jethrot> says tagName undefined
[18:21:11] <jethrot> iszak
[18:22:18] <jethrot> oops I put it in $()
[18:22:24] <djQuery> iszak: in both the css and the style it should have a z-index of 3 and all others should have a 2
[18:22:28] <iszak> djQuery, well your delegate is wrong then
[18:22:53] <djQuery> iszak: well the console.log is working so the delegate must be correct
[18:23:12] <djQuery> .tablewidget.ui-state-highlight{z-index: 3;}
[18:23:13] <iszak> djQuery, not here
[18:23:26] <iszak> oic
[18:23:35] <iszak> djQuery, it only occurs when you click it, not dragging
[18:23:42] <djQuery> right
[18:23:54] <iszak> use the jquery ui events
[18:24:10] <iszak> aka start/drag/stop/create
[18:24:10] <djQuery> iszak: hmmmmm click on fires on mouseup doesnt it
[18:24:35] <jethrot> how to find a td inside a tr by class name?
[18:24:43] <jethrot> (class id)
[18:26:21] <jonathansampson> $("tr td.className");
[18:26:59] <jonathansampson> Of course there isn't much purpose to include the general TR reference in that selector.
[18:27:17] <jethrot> what if I have a "this"
[18:27:22] <jethrot> like, the row...
[18:27:32] <jethrot> this=a <tr> containing <td>s
[18:27:45] <djQuery> jonathansampson: this might be of use    $('tbody>tr td.classname')
[18:27:59] <jethrot> this is in a .live()
[18:28:18] <djQuery> $(this).find('td.classname');
[18:28:19] <jethrot> I tried using .children(".key") to no avail
[18:29:09] <jonathansampson_> Sorry; too difficult to type on the iPad - on my PC now.
[18:29:33] <jonathansampson_> So you're trying to find a .td from an anchor?
[18:29:53] <jonathansampson_> $("a").live("click", function(e){ /*...*/ }); <- this?
[18:29:54] <jethrot> I'm in a live() and it handed me a table row that I clicked..
[18:30:00] <jethrot> called 'this'
[18:30:15] <jonathansampson_> Okay, so you would use that row for a context: $("td.myClass", this);
[18:30:16] <jethrot> I am trying and failing to get the <td class="key"></td> that is inside this row
[18:30:32] <jonathansampson_> The second parameter is the context of the selector.
[18:30:41] <jethrot> can i var tdKey=$("td.key",this); ?
[18:30:42] <jonathansampson_> "this" represents the TR that you wish to look inside.
[18:30:56] <jonathansampson_> tdkey would be a reference to that td in this case, sure.
[18:31:30] <jonathansampson_> Do you need to store a reference, or can you just begin chaining methods after your selector?
[18:31:45] <jethrot> how to get the contents of the <td>?  the text inside?
[18:31:47] <jonathansampson_> Why pass the results of the jQuery function into a var?
[18:31:52] <jethrot> key.innerHTML ?
[18:31:56] <jonathansampson_> $("td.key", this).text();
[18:32:14] <jonathansampson_> Note that this will strip all HTML, if you have any, and give you only the plain text version of the contents.
[18:32:20] <jonathansampson_> $.text()?
[18:32:46] <barbi> Hi, Newbie to jQuery and interested in contributing. Any way to identify novice tickets?
[18:32:48] <jethrot> why would this be empty?
[18:33:05] <jonathansampson_> jethrot, 'this' meaning the TR?
[18:33:12] <jethrot> the td.key
[18:33:36] <jonathansampson_> Make sure you're actually finding that TR - if you don't find it there won't be anything returned from $.text();
[18:33:47] <jonathansampson_> Try this: alert( $("td.key", this).length );
[18:34:02] <jonathansampson_> If it says "1", it was able to find the TD. If it doesn't, you need to look at the code again to see what's wrong.
[18:34:45] <jethrot> says 0
[18:35:07] <jonathansampson_> Then there either is not td with the class name you're trying, or it's not in the TR you're using.
[18:35:29] <jonathansampson_> Can you confirm there is a <td class="key"> inside the TR?
[18:36:12] <jonathansampson_> If you can post your jQuery and HTML to http://jsbin.com I could help you better.
[18:36:43] <jethrot> try it here: http://gudagi.com/datatables/datatest.php  -- see "table 3" -- click row
[18:37:37] <jonathansampson_> looking.
[18:38:44] <jonathansampson_> Which line is the jQuery code you're working with?
[18:39:10] <jethrot> look for "Click event handler" under "*** dt3" comment
[18:39:52] <jonathansampson_> Lines 191-194?
[18:40:32] <jethrot> unknown
[18:40:32] <jonathansampson_> No TD in that row has a classname of "key".
[18:40:36] <jethrot> probably
[18:40:40] <jethrot> yes i noticed that
[18:40:49] <jethrot> but it IS a row.. but its hidden
[18:40:51] <jethrot> e-gads
[18:41:00] <jethrot> stupid datatables
[18:41:06] <jonathansampson_> So you're looking for another TR that has .key?
[18:41:15] <jethrot> key is a hidden column
[18:41:20] <jethrot> so it is not rendered
[18:41:28] <jethrot> therefore its not in the dom
[18:41:40] <jonathansampson_> Ah; I was going to say - I'm inspecting with firebug and I see nothing with .key :)
[18:41:47] <jethrot> there is one in the head i bet
[18:41:52] <jethrot> <thead>
[18:42:21] <jonathansampson_> Nothing on the page has .key for a classname.
[18:42:35] <jonathansampson_> In firebug I ran alert( $(".key").length ); and got 0
[18:43:03] <jethrot> jonathansampson_ view source, find class="key"
[18:43:41] <jonathansampson_> ...interesting. One second.
[18:44:27] <Phoenixz> If I have a $('form').submit(){}, how can I detect what button was used to cause that submit?
[18:44:52] <jethrot> jonathansampson_ trying a different method
[18:52:55] <donssp> see ya guys , good night
[18:53:04] <BrandonZacharie> Phoenixz: in short... you cant
[18:53:11] <BrandonZacharie> however
[18:53:46] <BrandonZacharie> you can add a name and value to a button and read that to determine what button was clicked
[18:54:43] <jonathansampson_> Phoenixz http://jsbin.com/oquju6/edit
[18:55:18] <jonathansampson_> I gave my buttons a common class, and during the click checked other attributes like the ID. Pretty much what BrandonZacharie just said.
[18:55:24] <BrandonZacharie> <input type="submit" name="button1" value="Submit" />
[18:56:07] <BrandonZacharie> in your post you would see button=Submit
[18:56:16] <jonathansampson_> Phoenixz Here's a function demo with code: http://jsbin.com/oquju6/edit
[18:56:16] <BrandonZacharie> i meant "button1"
[18:56:25] <jonathansampson_> functional*
[18:57:41] <jethrot> how to compare two strings in javascript case sensitive?
[18:58:06] <BrandonZacharie> equality comparisons are case sensitive by default
[18:58:26] <BrandonZacharie> i.e. 'FOO' !== 'foo'
[18:58:51] <jonathansampson_> ?js 'foo' === 'FOO';
[18:59:04] <jonathansampson_> I could have sworn there was a bot in here that processed javascript.
[18:59:20] <BrandonZacharie> if you wish t-tbot is gone
[18:59:48] <jonathansampson_> Bummer.
[18:59:53] <BrandonZacharie> my engrish is horribad today
[19:00:55] <BrandonZacharie> .seen t-tbot
[19:00:55] <hsbot> BrandonZacharie: I have never seen t-tbot.
[19:01:20] <jonathansampson_> Bots, never there when you need them :)
[19:01:21] <ryanneufeld> ?load
[19:01:27] <ryanneufeld> dang
[19:01:34] <ryanneufeld> still no bot-t
[19:01:35] <jonathansampson_> ryan, doesn't seem to be working :(
[19:01:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:01:50] <BrandonZacharie> .seen bot-t
[19:01:50] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 1 day, 15 hours and 36 minutes ago, quitting with the message: Client Quit
[19:02:12] <ryanneufeld> .seen paulirish
[19:02:12] <hsbot> ryanneufeld: I have never seen paulirish.
[19:02:22] <jonathansampson_> .seen paul_irish
[19:02:22] <hsbot> paul_irish was seen 30 minutes and 40 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: boaz: pm me paypal
[19:02:48] <Phoenixz> BrandonZacharie: jonathansampson_ sorry, was on phone.. Thanks! I'll check the examples!
[19:03:11] <jonathansampson_> Phoenixz Inexcusable! :)
[19:03:30] <GoGoGarrett> If I had a man-crush, he may or may not be on my list. who's to asy
[19:03:33] <jonathansampson_> Unless you were using that phone for dialup :)
[19:03:56] <BrandonZacharie> jonathansampson_ and i came up with the same thing.... his link should should do the trick for you
[19:06:31] <enerel> i need a firefox style horizontal tab menu with drop down, or horizontal slider control when there is not enought space on the browser window. is there any plugin?
[19:07:14] <jonathansampson_> enerel There's a lot of buzz around jQuery UI's menu plugin. Have you checked it out?
[19:07:35] <enerel> i will check it
[19:07:38] <jonathansampson_> I've not, so I cannot vouch for its ability to exactly what you're looking for, but it's the first place I would look.
[19:08:39] <GoGoGarrett> ryanneufeld You know how i pulled from facebooks api to populate the image gallery,  He instead insisted on using another type of plugin haha.
[19:08:40] <jethrot> what does this mean? can't convert undefined to object
[19:08:40] <jethrot> [Break On This Error] (function(a,b){function cy(a){return f...h]&&f.event.trigger(c,d,b.handle.elem
[19:10:33] <jonathansampson_> Can you show us a bit more code, jethrot?
[19:10:45] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: thats funny
[19:11:04] <jonathansampson_> Feel free to use http://pastebin.com/
[19:17:13] <zoggy> hmm adding images to a drop down list..
[19:18:04] <jonathansampson_> zoggy Do you have a question?
[19:18:25] <jethrot> jonathansampson_ just look at the url i gave you earlier
[19:18:49] <zoggy> http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/jquery-image-dropdown
[19:18:50] <jonathansampson_> jethrot Please send again - a lot has happened since then :)
[19:18:57] <zoggy> naa, just was pondering idea.. looking for resources
[19:28:36] <coldboot|air> Is there a way, in CSS, to tell an svg image to expand proportionally to the size of its container? All I have figured out is you get to pick either width or height to max out, but you will get overflow in some of the four combinations of image size to container size.
[19:29:11] <zoggy> width: 100%;
[19:29:23] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air I believe setting one explicit value and the other "auto" will do this for you.
[19:29:48] <zoggy> there are a billion image resize jquery plugins though
[19:29:55] <JonathanSampson_> width:100% will work as long as the width is greater than the height, else you'll have vertical-overflow.
[19:30:35] <kojiro> What's the best way to get the text contents of an <option val="something_i_dont_want">Something I do want</option>?
[19:30:37] <zoggy> http://css-tricks.com/how-to-resizeable-background-image/
[19:30:46] <kojiro> in particular, the option that's currently selected.
[19:31:08] <JonathanSampson_> $(":option[val='something_i_dont_want']").text();
[19:31:17] <ch3mical> $('option:selected').text()
[19:31:24] <kojiro> :)
[19:31:44] <JonathanSampson_> Oh, ch3mical is right then.
[19:31:46] <kojiro> perfect, thanks!
[19:31:59] <JonathanSampson_> I also had a typo :)
[19:32:34] <ch3mical> Personally, I like to make sure I get the options from the right selectbox by doing $('#selectID option:selected')
[19:33:14] <zoggy> i dont think you even have to do option: but just :selected
[19:33:15] <JonathanSampson_> Personally, I prefer splitting up on my context from my targets: $("option:selected", "#selectID").text(); Hehe.
[19:33:22] <zoggy> $('#blah :selected').text();
[19:33:50] <JonathanSampson_> zoggy Sure, as long as nothing else on the page is selected :)
[19:34:04] <JonathanSampson_> Well, you provided #blah, so no worries there.
[19:34:20] <rpflo> JonathanSampson_: I think it assumes #blah is a <select> element
[19:34:33] <zoggy> #blah limits your scope
[19:34:39] <JonathanSampson_> Using option might be faster though, assuming it uses getElementsByTagName().
[19:34:50] <zoggy> now if you have 2 id's with selectable stuff.. then yes could be bad.. but thats just bad coding anyways
[19:35:02] <zoggy> well duplicate id's rather
[19:35:03] <kojiro> in my case I'm selecting from an already-defined <select>
[19:35:09] <kojiro> in fact, in a jquery callback
[19:35:21] <kojiro> so it's just $(this).find(":selected")
[19:35:30] <kojiro> (.text())
[19:35:46] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: Say your container is 10x2, and your image is 10x4, if you set the width of your image to 100%, then it will set its height to 4, which is bigger than the container.
[19:35:56] <zoggy> if you are using a callback.. couldnt you just use the callback id?
[19:36:18] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air Correct. You could either hide your overflow, or cut your losses.
[19:36:20] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: So there needs to be some intelligence to detect which side should be maximized to achieve maximum size without going over.
[19:36:52] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: So there's no way to do this without using JavaScript, right?
[19:37:00] <JonathanSampson_> codeboot|air I don't think CSS will be the only technology used to solve this then. You'll likely need to use some JavaScript or jQuery (if that simplifies the issue for you).
[19:37:27] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air I don't think so - not if you're actually performing logic and comparing values over against container dimensions.
[19:37:34] <coldboot|air> Ack, this is another way in which CSS fails.
[19:37:54] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air CSS doesn't fail - it's meant to style, not perform conditional logic based on math.
[19:38:09] <JonathanSampson_> Well, IE has some expressions that you can run, but that isn't really an option if you want cross-browser support.
[19:38:12] <zoggy> why not set height and width to 100%
[19:38:20] <zoggy> wont adhear to aspect ratio obviously...
[19:38:21] <JonathanSampson_> zoggy That would stretch the image.
[19:38:22] <coldboot|air> zoggy: That will stretch the image and make it look silly.
[19:38:55] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air Have you thought about making the image the bg of the container, and then centering it that way? That way all sides are uniformly cropped?
[19:39:17] <JonathanSampson_> This would only work if the image and the container are _almost_ the same dimensions.
[19:40:46] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: Under the hood, CSS is using math to calculate the size of things. This should be no exception.
[19:41:09] <ch3mical> k, have fun all
[19:41:44] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air The only thing I can think of that would be remotely close to that would be the relationship between pixels and em. I don't know of any other feature in CSS that does what you're suggesting in all honesty.

[19:42:08] <jethrot> can you make your name sorter?  jsampson?
[19:42:10] <jethrot> shorter
[19:42:28] <rpflo> jethrot: Jo->[tab]
[19:42:38] <jethrot> :P
[19:43:15] <JonathanSampson_> I would prefer keeping it full-length. Sorry for the pain in typing it out :) I know the agony; I use my iPad to chat here from time to time and it's torture.
[19:43:23] <rpflo> jethrot: No, really, your IRC client should autocomplete it with tab
[19:43:44] <jethrot> JonathanSampson,
[19:43:51] <JonathanSampson> Bingo ;)
[19:43:56] <jethrot>  http://gudagi.com/datatables/datatest.php
[19:44:19] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: I can't have the image cropped at all.
[19:44:48] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air Unfortunately I think you'll have to include a tincy-bit of JavaScript to the mix then.
[19:45:24] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: Just setting something to `width="100%"` is checking the size of the container to generate the size of the object. Having an extra check in there to set `height="max" width="max"` to expand both sides until one is maxed out would make sense, I think.
[19:45:43] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: Yeah, I thought that would be the answer. I'm trying to build this functionality into Scott Chacon's showoff presentation software.
[19:45:45] <JonathanSampson_> coldboot|air I agree.
[19:46:26] <rpflo> Where are the jQuery docs, not the website, the source in the repository or something ...
[19:46:52] <JonathanSampson_> rpflo You can view them on github.
[19:47:17] <rpflo> JonathanSampson: which repo?
[19:47:34] <JonathanSampson_> Note also you can download the development version of jQuery from jQuery.com which is non-minified. Great for casual reading :)
[19:47:55] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: On what event would you get this JavaScript to resize the image? If its container changed size?
[19:47:57] <JonathanSampson_> http://github.com/jquery/jquery
[19:48:14] <JonathanSampson_> coldbook|air You could do it on the .load() for the image itself.
[19:48:20] <rpflo> JonathanSampson: I'm actually looking to clean up some of the examples
[19:48:34] <coldboot|air> JonathanSampson_: Then if you resize the container, it'll break.
[19:48:38] <JonathanSampson_> rpflo Ah; You'll need to jump into one of the jQuery meetings and volunteer.
[19:48:47] <JonathanSampson_> coldbook|air Bind it to multiple events.
[19:48:52] <rpflo> JonathanSampson: I'm in the repo, I have my own fork, I just don't see the docs in there
[19:49:07] <JonathanSampson_> rpflo Ah; I'm not sure if the docs are in there. Sorry.

[19:55:50] <MACscr> Is there a plugin or function for jquery that would enable the live viewing of a log file? Would almost work like the tail command in linux
[19:56:30] <JonathanSampson_> MACscr Sounds like long-polling.
[19:57:20] <JonathanSampson_> Basically you would request the latest records from the server, and the server would hold the connection opened until it had new records to send back. Once received, the DOM is updated, and a new request is made (which will be help open until new data arrives).
[19:57:27] <JonathanSampson_> Wash. Rinse. Repeat :)

[20:24:23] <Karai> Hello, I am having a very frustrating issue and I was wondering if anyone could take a moment to have a look? For some reason, Firefox 4 does not want to detect my variable, but Chrome works flawlessly... http://k17.me/player
[20:25:44] <BrandonZacharie> GoGoGarrett: correct
[20:28:15] <ThrushAAX> Karai: what/which variable?
[20:28:23] <Karai> var audio
[20:33:27] <ThrushAAX> have you tried renaming it to something else?
[20:34:01] <ner0x> If I wanted a scrollable how would I go about it?
[20:34:11] <Karai> I think the issue might be that I have my code separated into a few different files to try and manage clutter... I'm reorganizing them now and seeing if that helps~
[20:34:47] <ThrushAAX> yeah, I see you defined it in one function, and were accessing it in another... which you should not be able to do
[20:35:08] <Karai> mm~
[20:35:12] <Karai> it works in chrome, somehow haha
[20:36:07] <ThrushAAX> in chrome its somehow in the global namespace
[20:36:35] <ThrushAAX> I'm not sure if its actually the variable
[20:37:14] <ThrushAAX> it actually looks like it may be grabbing it from the id O_O
[20:37:39] <ThrushAAX> unless thats just a special feature of the chrome javascript console..
[20:38:16] <BrandonZacharie> Karai: were you refering to 'var audio' in 'http://k17.me/player/includes/scripts/player_controller.js' ?
[20:38:33] <Karai> BrandonZacharie: yes
[20:39:34] <BrandonZacharie> Karai: there is an element with the id audio which gets auto mapped to the global namespace
[20:40:26] <BrandonZacharie> Karai: it is not the same value as is assigned to the 'audio' variable in your closure
[20:40:43] <Karai> hrm...
[20:42:01] <BrandonZacharie> Karai: actually i lied
[20:42:12] <BrandonZacharie> Karai: $('#audio').get(0) === window.audio

[21:13:02] <amid_hasan> ie  $('.div').click(function(){ var clicked = $(this).html(); // use clicked as a selecter in $('a#[clicked]').append('blah');});

[22:00:51] <madprops> im trying $(this).attr("src", "site_media/banner.jpg") + '?' + Math.random();
[22:01:10] <danheberden> has that same image already been loaded?
[22:01:17] <Karai> $(this).attr("src", "site_media/banner.jpg" + '?' + Math.random());
[22:01:48] <Karai> $(this).attr("src", "site_media/banner.jpg?" + Math.random());
[22:02:11] <BrandonZacharie> madprops: you must make that a valid querystrinf
[22:02:18] <amid_hasan> speaking of Math.random(): how do you generate a random number withing a range. i.e. var min = 1; var max = 30; doRandom();
[22:02:34] <amid_hasan> what's the function to get random numbers within a defined range?
[22:02:42] <BrandonZacharie> madprops: i.e. '...?_=' + Math.random()
[22:02:44] <danheberden> ?eval 30 * Math.random();
[22:03:04] <Karai> the random munber coudl be the variable name, not the value, so that would be valid
[22:03:16] <danheberden> basically, Math.random() always gives you a number between 0 and 1
[22:03:21] <danheberden> so if you need a range, from 0 to X
[22:03:24] <danheberden> just X * Math.random()
[22:03:39] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: i wrote a function for that... one moment please
[22:03:48] <danheberden> if you need a range from Y - X, then it's (x-y)*Math.random()+y
[22:03:50] <amid_hasan> BrandonZacharie: this is exciting
[22:03:57] <amid_hasan> awaiting your awesome function
[22:03:59] <amid_hasan> :P
[22:04:12] <JonathanSampson_> Really coming alive in here since I went away :)
[22:04:32] <danheberden> function randomRange(start,max) { return ( (start-max)*Math.random()+start ); }
[22:05:01] <danheberden> that might need a +1 in there somewhere
[22:05:06] <mangos-> how can i simulate a click to a <a> ?
[22:05:19] <BrandonZacharie> if (!Array.prototype.random)
[22:05:19] <BrandonZacharie> Array.prototype.random = function Array_prototype_random(min, max) {
[22:05:19] <BrandonZacharie> 	var l = this.length >>> 0,
[22:05:19] <BrandonZacharie> 		min = Math.max(min || 0, 0),
[22:05:19] <BrandonZacharie> 		max = Math.min(max || l, l);
[22:05:20] <amid_hasan> What about a function that generates 5 random numbers and does not duplicate numbers already selected?
[22:05:21] <BrandonZacharie> 	
[22:05:24] <BrandonZacharie> 	return this[Math.floor((Math.random() * (max - min)) + min)];
[22:05:28] <JonathanSampson_> mangos $("a").trigger("click");
[22:05:34] <JonathanSampson_> Be more specific about which a though.
[22:05:44] <BrandonZacharie> sorry
[22:05:49] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/BrandonZacharie/mxDXh/
[22:05:55] <GoGoGarrett> Math.floor(Math.random() * maximum)
[22:06:49] <amid_hasan> what is jquery edge?
[22:06:57] <Zackko> Im creating some page elements on the fly in jquery, adding classes etc, and when im done, id like to fade it in, But after appending it to the document using .append(), i cant for the life of get fadeIn(), show() or anything of that nature to work properly. Doesnt matter if i set .css('display', 'none') first, or go .hide() first, w/e, it it will not animate the opacity or anything. any ideas fellas? This has been driving me crazy for 2 d
[22:07:02] <Zackko> :)
[22:07:10] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: latest version
[22:07:10] <mangos-> JonathanSampson: <a href="#" id="pane1">
[22:07:28] <JonathanSampson_> $("a#pane1").trigger("click");
[22:07:38] <mangos-> thanks! :)
[22:08:15] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: you may use that function as such: ['a','b','c','d'].random()
[22:09:11] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: and/or  as such: ['a','b','c','d'].random(min)
[22:09:15] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: and/or  as such: ['a','b','c','d'].random(min, max)
[22:09:57] <amid_hasan> BrandonZacharie: this is what I got so far. no luck implementing your function... help? http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/mxDXh/6/
[22:10:16] <amid_hasan> should call Array_prototype_random(1,30);?.
[22:10:59] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan:its a prototype of Array
[22:11:31] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: so you would call it like 'my_array.random()'
[22:11:45] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko Check out http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=long+polling+jquery
[22:11:49] <JonathanSampson_> Ooops, wrong link.
[22:11:59] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko http://jsbin.com/eqira3/edit
[22:13:13] <madprops> any idea why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/Zb3Sr/
[22:13:44] <madprops> it matches the src but the image doesn't change
[22:14:15] <JonathanSampson_> madprops I don't see anything that `this` is referencing.
[22:14:17] <JonathanSampson_> Where's the markup?
[22:16:04] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/BrandonZacharie/mxDXh/7/
[22:16:18] <madprops> JonathanSampson, http://jsfiddle.net/Zb3Sr/1/
[22:16:54] <JonathanSampson_> madprops You're using `this` as though it's referencing an IMG, however in the context it doesn't. Let me work up an example.
[22:18:03] <BrandonZacharie> anyone else needz help? i'm going to get yanked out of here soon
[22:18:18] <mangos-> BrandonZacharie: yeah if you could :P
[22:18:41] <mangos-> http://www.brasileirao.org/new-widget.html
[22:18:41] <BrandonZacharie> mangos-: where shall my blood be spilt?
[22:18:51] <mangos-> i'm trying to get one of those tabs to auto load onload
[22:18:57] <JonathanSampson_> madprops http://jsbin.com/oxezi3/edit
[22:18:58] <mangos-> #pane1 for ex
[22:19:00] <mangos-> how might i do that?
[22:19:04] <BrandonZacharie> mangos-: ok, im on it
[22:19:16] <JonathanSampson_> Mangos - Voce falar portuguese? :)
[22:19:24] <JonathanSampson_> Sorry, English only in here - nobody smack me.
[22:20:00] <mangos-> sim :)
[22:20:18] <JonathanSampson_> $(function(){ $(".tabs a:first").trigger("click"); });
[22:20:26] <Zackko> Hey guys im building some dom elements on the fly and then appending that container to my document, but id like it to fade in. I cant for the life of me get fadeIn(), show(), animate() or anything to work. If i set display to none, or opacity to 0, or go .hide() or anything before appending to the document, the animation i call afterward for showing it never works. It just never shows (ie remains display none, or w/e). animations like this
[22:20:26] <Zackko> fine on elements that were already in the dom and had display none via the stylesheet
[22:20:37] <BrandonZacharie> mangos-: you just need to trigger the first tab
[22:21:01] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko Did you not see my code I provided earlier? :)
[22:21:09] <amid_hasan> Does anyone have sample code on how to make a dependend drop down? Two select inputs, with data coming from json?
[22:21:12] <madprops> JonathanSampson, i didn't put the entire jquery code, that is inside a $('img').error(function(){} hence $(this)
[22:21:23] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko http://jsbin.com/eqira3/edit
[22:21:26] <BrandonZacharie> mangos-: $('.tabs').eq(0).trigger('click')
[22:21:46] <JonathanSampson_> BrandonZacharie .tabs references his UL. Shouldn't the click take place on the anchor?
[22:21:46] <GoGoGarrett> I have a question Brandon
[22:21:51] <Zackko> JonathanSampson: no im sorry i got kicked i never saw it
[22:21:54] <mangos-> wow so simple
[22:22:03] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko No problem. Did you catch it this time?
[22:22:09] <GoGoGarrett> How can I get a value returned from css position's I'm trying this -  if( parseInt($(this).css('left')) > 10 ) {
[22:22:13] <BrandonZacharie> JonathanSampson_: correct
[22:22:33] <Zackko> i got your link yes
[22:22:33] <BrandonZacharie> mangos-: take a look at JonathanSampson_ 's example... that should work for you
[22:22:40] <mangos-> it did BrandonZacharie
[22:22:45] <mangos-> thanks for both of your help, appreciate it
[22:22:47] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko Cool; check it out. It should do what you're trying.
[22:23:02] <JonathanSampson_> Mangos Obrigado voce por o opportunidade :)
[22:23:10] <Zackko> it looks like what im doing to an extent, let me show you my code
[22:23:10] <mangos-> :D fala muito bem portugues!
[22:23:12] <amid_hasan> This room is kickin' tonight
[22:23:30] <JonathanSampson_> Mangos - Thanks. I'm sure your Portuguese is better than mine though ;)
[22:23:50] <JonathanSampson_> amid_hasan We keep it real ;)
[22:24:46] <amid_hasan> How do you do dependent drop down menus. See zocdoc.com for a live example. I think they are pulling json data into dropdowns. Looks like jquery...
[22:24:48] <amid_hasan> ?
[22:25:17] <BrandonZacharie> amid_hasan: unfortunately, i have just about run out of time
[22:25:33] <JonathanSampson_> BrandonZacharie Thanks for all the help this evening.
[22:25:56] <amid_hasan> Thank you for your guidance BrandonZacharie
[22:26:24] <mangos-> thanks BrandonZacharie
[22:26:27] <BrandonZacharie> JonathanSampson_: no, thank you and everyone else for your support
[22:26:49] <BrandonZacharie> i'll be back tomorrow if i'm not too busy with work
[22:26:57] <JonathanSampson_> BrandonZacharie Same here.
[22:27:16] <JonathanSampson_> I kind of neglected my duties this evening over at StackOverflow - need to not get so swept up in #jquery :)
[22:27:19] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks for the help today =]
[22:29:11] <Zackko> JonathanSampson: http://jsbin.com/abume5/edit
[22:29:17] <Zackko> sorry it took so long lol
[22:29:42] <Zackko> thats all the code you need to see, theres a few comments in there to guide you
[22:29:43] <JonathanSampson_> Let me take a look.
[22:29:48] <madprops> JonathanSampson, it still doesn't work, i have no idea why that if is not working
[22:31:21] <JonathanSampson_> madprops You'll need to provide more code than you did before. The example I shared with you worked.
[22:37:07] <Zackko> JonathanSampson: get a chance to browse my code?
[22:37:21] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko Looking at it now.
[22:37:25] <Zackko> ok thnx
[22:37:37] <JonathanSampson_> Tough to test without having the HTML, etc. Working on a replica.
[22:38:09] <Zackko> Well, theres nothing other than the container in the html anyhow, i guess you just dont have the json valuesi use for the textnodes
[22:38:19] <Zackko> nothing that youneed*
[22:38:49] <Zackko> i could try to put together a lil more code to make it functional if youd like?
[22:41:29] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/mQpgC/1/  This is strictly pointless and for learning, but How can i reassign left/right positions back to 0 to make this loop around
[22:46:21] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko It's difficult because there are also some vars that aren't even declared in the block that I'm looking at.
[22:46:32] <niftylettuce> <label><input></label> vs <label><input>
[22:46:34] <niftylettuce> what say you folk?
[22:46:35] <Zackko> yea im mocking up some defaults for you bud
[22:46:35] <JonathanSampson_> For instance "textValue" is used, but I don't see it declared anywhere.
[22:46:55] <JonathanSampson_> I've got a little more than half of it re-made, and functional.
[22:47:05] <niftylettuce> oooo not #html5
[22:47:06] <niftylettuce> sorryz
[22:48:13] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko Here's what I've done so far - http://jsbin.com/ateho4/edit
[22:48:33] <JonathanSampson_> Not super clean - would definitely clean it up with more time.
[22:49:19] <JonathanSampson_> Zackko I'm very sorry, man, but I need to head out. I hope this is helpful in some measure and perhaps I'll catch you in here later.
[22:49:21] <Zackko> ok, let me takea look and finish my mock up
[22:49:27] <Zackko> urgg
[22:49:32] <Zackko> i was basically done haha
[22:49:37] <JonathanSampson_> Hehe.
[22:49:38] <Zackko> but if you haftoo go man its ok
[22:49:57] <JonathanSampson_> If you don't get it on your own, jump over to http://stackoverflow.com and the guys will help you there for sure :)
[22:50:34] <Zackko> thanks man
[22:50:50] <JonathanSampson_> You're welcome, Zackko.
[22:50:55] <JonathanSampson_> Tchau, Mangos. Boa noite.
[22:51:34] * JonathanSampson_ nods off into magical jQuery land.
[22:54:42] <GoGoGarrett> unicorns and dollar signs
[22:57:28] <Hierofant> Unicracks
[23:16:18] <Zackko> JonathanSampson: I know you took off but if you get this, thanks man, i got it wrking. Turns out i had a duplicate element on the page and jquery was getting confused as to where to append the review and somehow tht haulted the animation
[23:18:17] <Karai> If I declare a variable outside of a function, say, var audio, and then assign a value to audio, will it assume i am meaning the global variable or will it create a new variable in local scope?
[23:18:23] <Karai> :\
[23:18:33] <Superman_> how to enable and disable whole form with jquery?
[23:19:49] <Zackko> Karai: I believe it will reassign the global one
[23:20:15] <Karai> Okie dokie, I am having a lot of what I believe to be scope issues so I am hoping this iwll fix everything...
[23:20:26] <Zackko> if you use var inside the function it MIGHT make a new var
[23:20:40] <Zackko> im not a js pro, just messin myself
[23:20:41] <Karai> I know js is very loose on syntax so I wasn't sur eif omitting the 'var' would tell it to use a predefined variabl eo rnot
[23:20:56] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/mQpgC/7/   Why wont the .position().left value update :/
[23:21:06] <Karai> sans typos x_x 3:20am, getting hard to type haha
[23:21:10] <Zackko> def makes a diff using var, but idk exactly what it does in every case
[23:21:42] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[23:21:46] <wkmanire> Man, its been a while.
[23:21:46] <Zackko> Karai: i can jsbin it for you
[23:22:12] <Karai> Nah, that's fine, I'll muck around som emore
[23:25:26] <Karai> Well, that worked... Now more errors :v yay firefox
[23:25:29] <wkmanire> I sure wish M$'s MVC2 played nicer with Backbone.js
[23:25:33] * wkmanire grumbles....
[23:26:41] <wkmanire> Hard to believe that a little over a 1000 line framework could be this useful though. Backbone rocks.
[23:28:24] <Zackko> Karai: I was right, if you use var, it will makea variable in the local scope, if you dont use var, it changes the global
[23:28:57] <Karai> awesome :)
[23:29:08] <wkmanire> Zackko: Correct. it doesn't matter how deeply nested into function calls you are, assigning a variable that wasn't declared with var will attach it to the global scope.
[23:29:18] <Zackko> :)
[23:29:23] <Zackko> at least im learning haha
[23:29:28] <Karai> :D
[23:29:37] <Zackko> ^ And so is this guy
[23:29:45] <wkmanire> he he
[23:30:01] <wkmanire> <---- and so is this guy.
[23:30:38] * wkmanire is wired on guarana powder and coke zero. :D
[23:30:59] <Zackko> lolz that'll do it
[23:31:15] <Zackko> i was doing similar things last night trying to fix a jquery issue
[23:32:26] <wkmanire> My brazillian friend sent me some "Guaraná Ralado".  It basically tastes and smells like mud... but holy crap does it pack a punch.
[23:32:41] <Karai> fevhnjfe ivthis makes no sense
[23:33:05] <ryrych> hi
[23:33:15] <wkmanire> ryrych: Howdy.
[23:33:20] <Karai> some of my functions require me to specify $audio in the arguements (even though it is global) and others do not...
[23:33:51] <devinrolsen> yay for success!! http://tinyurl.com/3hzngcl, I made this little bookmarlet script that will let you gather a global report of all non-used selectors in your long style sheets over all your site pages (not just a per page scenario).
[23:34:03] <devinrolsen> bookmarklet*
[23:34:52] <ryrych> what do you think is the best way to give know your inner code that an error occured? In jQuery UI plugin. Now I remember it via .data() and reads later
[23:34:56] <ryrych> more pr0 way?
[23:35:08] <wkmanire> devinrolsen: Nice. Did you use the document.styleSheets API?
[23:36:19] <devinrolsen> no, basicly found a good pattern to minify a stylesheet with JS, then narrow down only the selectors and parse each one out over the document's elements with jquery.
[23:36:52] <devinrolsen> so, the more pages you keep browsing the report keeps updating the bad selectors to good selectors (if an element is found).
[23:37:12] <wkmanire> I see.
[23:37:13] <devinrolsen> so the move pages you view, the more accurate the report is, if you will.
[23:37:19] <devinrolsen> more pages*
[23:37:23] <wkmanire> That makes sense.
[23:37:38] <wkmanire> I`ve worked on a few different mature projects that have these monstrous stylesheets.
[23:37:46] <wkmanire> Something like this would be a big help.
[23:37:59] <devinrolsen> yeah me too, actually its why I made it haha.
[23:38:20] <devinrolsen> I don't want to hand audit any more.
[23:39:29] <devinrolsen> the only problems it still has is (when loading it up via bookmarklet) you cant start the script from the web sites home page.
[23:39:58] <devinrolsen> and also any javascript that adds to the DOM wont reflect in the report.
[23:40:05] <devinrolsen> still working on that last one.
[23:41:04] <wkmanire> That's kind of a hard one.
[23:41:13] <wkmanire> I know there are some different event libraries that will give you DOM changed events.
[23:41:36] <wkmanire> I think they're polling and counting children or something similar, unless there is a new HTML5 event I am unaware of (which is likely)
[23:41:54] <wkmanire> Check out microjs.com and search through the event libraries, you might find something useful there.
[23:43:52] <ryrych> anyone? :)
[23:44:49] <devinrolsen> wkmanire well the difficult part is setting them on all elements inside an iframe.
[23:45:08] <wkmanire> ryrych: Your question was a bit too general for me to feel confident in giving you any advice.
[23:45:09] <devinrolsen> cross domain is not an issue is kicking off the script from the bookmarklet.
[23:45:37] <wkmanire> devinrolsen: Especially if that iframe has an off domain src.
[23:45:56] <wkmanire> ah, just saw your last post.
[23:47:10] <ryrych> wkmanire: I would like plugin code to be aware of an error – how would you alert it?
[23:47:47] <Deele> how was defined many css rules simultaniously?
[23:47:47] <wkmanire> ryrych: Is it a native exception or is your page throwing it manually?
[23:48:40] <Deele> like alternative to .css('x','y').css('k','l')
[23:49:38] <Deele> nvm
[23:49:45] <wkmanire> Deele: What did you find?
[23:50:37] <ryrych> wkmanire: is an Ajax error, I handle it with .error, but, later my code must know that it happened
[23:50:58] <ryrych> I save the state with .data
[23:51:08] <wkmanire> ryrych: You can attach multiple events to .error
[23:51:47] <wkmanire> When your plugin is initializing itself, have it attach a handler to the error event and then set some instance member.
[23:53:28] <devinrolsen> yeah wkmanire, http://pastebin.com/RwrL5Uh8 when ever I add this code to the load() test for the iframe, only links that are clicked in the iframe console out something.. its very strange.
[23:54:42] <wkmanire> devinrolsen: Why strange? You are explicitly binding to the iframe's contents.
[23:55:04] <KingDosser> Hey coldhead
[23:55:11] <ryrych> wkmanire: it is a bit tricky to explain, but I’ll try: it is a lightbox; all animation is performed in a custom queue; in one part of the queue I load content; if an ajax error occurs, I must show a message to a user that it happened but keep the queue, that is display this message as a part of the animation queue – finish this queue; but a few functions in the queue need to be aware of the error so I must let them know somehow
[23:55:18] <devinrolsen> well I figured all elements (not just anchors) would console log.
[23:55:58] <wkmanire> devinrolsen: I didn`t read your original statement carefully. I see what you mean now.
[23:56:25] <wkmanire> devinrolsen: find('*'), right.
[23:56:36] <devinrolsen> yeah.
[23:56:41] <wkmanire> Does it have the same behavior in other browsers?
[23:57:12] <devinrolsen> * is a CSS2 selector that should point to all elements. (dont quote me on CSS2)
[23:57:21] <ryrych> wkmanire: let’s say I load an image but an error occurs; normally I would display this image but now, istead of the image I display the error message, not breaking the queue
[23:58:11] <wkmanire> devinrolsen: Yes, I was aware, and even so, jQuery does get all elements with that selector regardless.
[23:58:34] <wkmanire> ryrych: Well, if you are using .data to persist state for your plugin, and each member of the queue has access to that data then you should be able to store something like lastError in it and default it to null.
[23:58:36] <Karai> I know this isn't exactly the right spot but I am here so I'll ask: Does anyone know why FireFox isn't reading song length properly for OGG files in the <audio /> element? http://k17.me/player/
[23:59:00] <wkmanire> then each member of the queue would share the requirement of having to check that lastError member to configure its logic.
[23:59:04] <devinrolsen> ok, lets get crazy with it, going to try looping over each ('*') and see if I can bind and get a different result.
[23:59:57] <ryrych> wkmanire: actually I do it, and it works, but I wonder if it is pr0 :D
