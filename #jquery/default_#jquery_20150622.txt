[00:23:39] <simpy> how to export the mulitple events through i calendar
[00:28:10] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows a way to add a couple of values to a submit event that doesnt involve prenventDefault and adding hidden fields etc? its a lot of data and its getting long and hard to debug :\
[00:29:39] <AcidBeard> Nope
[00:29:42] <parveen> simpy , check this http://keith-wood.name/icalendarRef.html
[00:30:23] <parveen> http://keith-wood.name/icalendarRef.html
[00:34:00] <parveen> Is there any way i can pass multiple start , end date with title in iCalender jquery ?
[00:35:54] <fig_guest403> how to export the multiple event using icalendar in jquery
[00:42:46] <Bjerre> mornin fellas
[00:42:53] <AcidBeard> Or night
[00:42:58] <AcidBeard> Perspective
[00:43:13] <Bjerre> depends on what mood you're in
[00:49:04] <Bjerre> Hmm, anyone who can recommend a good image slider? I will have a back and next button which will move the image to the left/right and move the new/old one in. They will all have the same ratio and I will add several more pictures later on so the code should not be looking for a specific filename.
[00:49:48] <Bjerre> there is no need for an auto run of the slider either
[00:54:00] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I read float-values like: "10.000,25" with parsley or something similar?
[01:00:22] <PrimalHunter> Hi, I'm running into an issue with cross site requests. Would it be covered by this channel? :/
[01:06:29] <Cork> PrimalHunter: possibly, try asking
[01:09:13] <PrimalHunter> I do have two parts of an application on a single host but on different ports. Thus it's a cross request. From what I understand modern browsers should support CORS which means by setting "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" should allow request from any host. For some reason it doesn't seem to. At least not with jQuery 2.1.3?
[01:09:45] <Cork> PrimalHunter: the responding server have to answer with that
[01:09:51] <Cork> also is the request a get or post?
[01:11:51] <PrimalHunter> It's a get ... but maybe I just found the issue - the options request gets a 401.
[01:12:13] <Cork> get requests doesn't cause a options request
[01:12:22] <Cork> only post/put requests does
[01:12:31] <Cork> and that is why i asked
[01:12:50] <Cork> if you do a post/put you also have to answer to the OPTIONS request
[01:12:51] <Kartagis> can someone help with ajax implementation in Drupal? I've got a nasty issue
[01:13:03] <Cork> Kartagis: #drupal
[01:13:12] <Cork> or is it ##drupal, don't remember
[01:13:35] <Cork> they are adding a lot of especial methods in drupal
[01:13:39] <Cork> so it is better if you ask there
[01:14:01] <Kartagis> Cork, #drupal, but I've been dealing with this issue for weeks now, I thought I could ask here too
[01:14:26] <Cork> Kartagis: you're not very likely to get drupal specific answers here
[01:15:52] <PrimalHunter> thanks cork, i'll look into that. The code uses $.ajax with type: "GET". There has to be a better way. *starts digging* :D
[01:16:22] <Cork> PrimalHunter: $.ajax is normally the best option
[01:16:31] <kokut> Hello, i'm trying to POST some inputs i created and somehow before the form.submit(); is called they have the right values but when i try var_dump($_POST) all the values are there (so the post is passing at least the variables initialized) but they are all "undefined" what am i missing? Is it something PHP related?
[01:16:43] <Cork> PrimalHunter: sure you can use $.get(), but it doesn't save you too much
[01:17:23] <Cork> kokut: check the browser console
[01:17:27] <kokut> do i have to json_decode that to even be able to print it as a string or something?
[01:17:33] <AcidBeard> Nope
[01:17:36] <Cork> inspect what values the browser actually send
[01:17:46] <kokut> i did, i commented the form.submit(); and they have the right values
[01:17:55] <Cork> no i meant in the network tab
[01:18:00] <kokut> oh
[01:18:06] <Cork> check what params is actually sent over the network
[01:19:08] <kokut> well its says its all undefined
[01:19:15] <Cork> there you go
[01:19:24] <Cork> so something is failing in the script
[01:19:25] <kokut> which is pretty weird since i just checked and the values are fine before form.submit();
[01:19:38] <AcidBeard> Put it in codepen
[01:19:46] <Cork> or even better jsfiddle
[01:19:50] <AcidBeard> Or that
[01:19:55] <kokut> its too long and only applies to my project
[01:20:10] <Cork> well then you're on your own
[01:20:22] <kokut> i'm going to try to fix it
[01:20:23] <Cork> can't say what goes wrong without the html+script
[01:20:27] <kokut> you just help me a lot
[01:20:42] <kokut> i didnt knew you could check post values on the browser
[01:32:56] <Bjerre> Hey guys. Any idea on how to make this not looking for a specific image name? I want to add a lot of images later on but won't be able to edit the html, only add images to a specific folder. Hard to show this on a jsfiddle since it will be locally hosted though: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/
[01:33:57] <Cork> Bjerre: js can't access unknown resources
[01:34:19] <Cork> it has to know about them one way to another (url saved in js, img tags in html, url's stored in css)
[01:34:40] <Cork> cause there is no way for js to list resources on the target server
[01:34:52] <Bjerre> but Cork if we know the folder name and let's say that the image names are image_1, image_2 etc
[01:34:54] <Cork> (well unless the server provides a list somehow)
[01:35:19] <Cork> Bjerre: then you would have know how many images would be in there
[01:35:27] <Cork> or js would have to fire http requests for each image
[01:35:32] <Bjerre> the thing is that it will add up over time Cork
[01:35:39] <Cork> and check if the resource exist that way (and you don't want to, it will be really slow)
[01:35:48] <Bjerre> I see
[01:36:02] <Cork> Bjerre: ya i get that, but the server side still have to tell it
[01:36:18] <Cork> simplest is to store a .json resource
[01:36:22] <Cork> and just pull that first
[01:36:33] <Bjerre> ah ok
[01:36:37] <Cork> ['img1','img2','img3',...]
[01:36:38] <Bjerre> and edit the json?
[01:36:52] <Cork> and then you just ajax fetch that json file and get what files exists
[01:37:07] <Cork> (and through that what resources exist)
[01:41:00] <Bjerre> I remember using some kind of 3d looking image previewer a couple of months ago Cork. I had 20 images of an object and you could rotate it. The code looked something like this: 'img/image####.jpg|1..20|1',
[01:41:09] <Bjerre> but as you said, I need to know how many to show
[01:41:14] <Bjerre> (20)
[01:41:18] <Bjerre> damn
[01:41:52] <Cork> Bjerre: the core of the problem is that js is always on the remote side of a network connection
[01:42:10] <Cork> so the server needs to provide an efficient way to find this info
[01:42:13] <Bjerre> ye I guess so
[01:42:35] <Cork> without having to resort to firing a ton of http requests to look for a 404
[01:42:47] <Bjerre> does it matter if the project will not run on the web? I believe I will show this on a single monitor only
[01:43:29] <kokut> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/kq1h08hv/ u see anything wrong?
[01:43:50] <Cork> Bjerre: if you run it in something like node.js/phantomjs/slimerjs then sure
[01:43:58] <Cork> Bjerre: but if you run in a browser it won't work
[01:44:06] <kokut> that is making all my fields undefined and i dont have a clue why
[01:44:09] <Bjerre> ok Cork
[01:44:12] <Bjerre> thanks
[01:44:19] <kokut> it was working before :\
[01:44:30] <Cork> kokut: too little info to tell
[01:44:43] <Cork> the form and the js meant to send it is needed
[01:44:45] <kokut> Cork: but that is all the code that is failing
[01:45:00] <Cork> ok, then ya, it fails cause the form is missing
[01:45:05] <kokut> i'm looking at the form in the DOM with all the inputs undefined
[01:45:20] <kokut> no i can see the form right there the fields all have undefined values
[01:45:49] <Cork> kokut: i'm not psychic, i can't see what you see
[01:45:53] <kokut> console.log(variable_added_to_field) shows the correct value
[01:46:15] <Cork> provide the needed info, or like i said; your on you're own
[01:46:17] <kokut> u see the fiddle? thats all the code that is failing
[01:46:43] <Cork> kokut: like i said the fiddle doesn't have the needed info
[01:47:58] <kokut> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/kq1h08hv/1/
[01:47:58] <arc_> the purpose of a fiddle is to show how your code interacts with something, that's just code
[01:50:46] <kokut> u seen the updated version?
[01:51:29] <kokut> this is driving me freaking nuts man :\
[01:51:34] <kokut> it looks fine
[01:53:21] <arc_> i assume the variables are initialized somewhere ...
[01:56:08] <Bjerre> I dont get it Cork, can I change the next and back button in the navigation variable? Or what are these comments for? Couldn't find the FAQ for this plugin http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/1/
[01:56:24] <Bjerre> I want to remove the original ones and add my own
[01:56:36] <kokut> arc_: okay im gonna try that but it should work anyways i mean otherwise console.log(var) shouldnt be showing the correct values, also its adding the correct name to the inputs :\
[01:57:00] <Cork> Bjerre: you would have to check the documentation for slidesjs to answer that
[01:57:24] <Cork> what i mentioned before is generic javascript limitations
[01:59:54] <kokut> please man can anyone give me at least a clue about what could be the problem?
[02:01:59] <arc_> this code cannot run. get it to a point where it can run in jsfiddle and then someone might be able to help you
[02:02:20] <arc_> you need to include the html
[02:02:25] <kokut> arc_ this code is not for jsfiddle
[02:02:34] <kokut> it has many variables that are echoed with PHP etc
[02:02:40] <kokut> also a lot of ajax
[02:03:15] <Cork> kokut: to be able to help you the code doesn't have to run
[02:03:21] <Cork> what it has to though is show the flow
[02:03:32] <Cork> as in the submit button the code modifying the form
[02:03:34] <Cork> THE FORM
[02:03:54] <Cork> without that one can't start to track down what happens and where things goes wrong
[02:04:12] <Cork> and all we can verify that what you're seeing is what you're seeing
[02:04:22] <Cork> (and not what you're missing)
[02:04:39] <Bjerre> Im tired Cork, nevermind on my last question :E
[02:04:46] <Bjerre> thanks though :)
[02:05:04] <Cork> np
[02:06:23] <kokut> cork, arc_ http://i.imgur.com/BqdrcCb.png
[02:07:51] <arc_> what is params[xey] supposed to be
[02:08:00] <arc_> from what this says, i would have thought that should be value
[02:08:22] <arc_> you are passing a variable to the function but you aren't using that parameter at all in the code
[02:08:30] <kokut> mmh yea you are right
[02:08:36] <kokut> damn
[02:09:48] <kokut> that was from a previous version that had objects i needed to pass with the form
[02:09:55] <arc_> i see
[02:11:00] <kokut> lol its working, ty arc_
[02:11:11] <kokut> and Cork
[02:19:55] <bweston92> For some reason $.ajax posting dataType as json it encodes the json into a form object rather then sending with a json payload, any ideas?
[02:23:56] <Cork> bweston92: $.ajax doesn't ever encode things as anything other then params
[02:24:09] <Cork> if you want to encode the request data as json you have to do that you're self
[02:24:34] <Cork> also dataType affects the Accept header, it doesn't say anything about the request encoding
[02:26:07] <Cork> bweston92: if you want to submit json you have to 1. set contentType: "application/json" (not dataType) and secondly encode the data with JSON.stringify
[03:12:28] <andygmb> anyone recognize this .form() function and know what it belongs to? http://dpaste.com/3XDF4D6 doesnt appear to be in the base jquery
[03:12:29] <inthl> using $(this).css('font-size') reads the size of that element in px. but assuming that it is set as e.g. "1.5vw;" ...how would I get that number 1.5, meaning as its relative value?
[03:16:31] <andygmb> nevermind on the above, turns out it's a semantic-ui form :)
[03:21:02] <Cork> andygmb: you would have to use the document.styleSheets find the rule applying the font-size
[03:21:12] <Cork> and then find the raw property in there
[03:21:25] <andygmb> inthl: not andygmb Cork :p
[03:21:33] <Cork> opps
[03:21:44] <Cork> inthl: .css uses the computedStyle value and it is always in px
[03:24:21] <inthl> hm
[03:42:11] <Bjerre> I dont get why the custom buttons won't work, even if it says in the documentation of sliderJS that you're supposed to use the same class names to get it working: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/3/
[03:44:06] <Cork> Bjerre: the element has to be inside #slides
[03:44:54] <Cork> Bjerre: from the lib '$(".slidesjs-next", $element).click(function(e) {'
[03:46:34] <Bjerre> oh I see Cork, that's odd
[03:47:33] <Bjerre> where did you find the lib Cork? Having a hard time to get good documentation out of the site
[03:47:47] <Cork> Bjerre: you linked it in the fiddle
[03:48:02] <Cork> https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slidesjs/3.0/jquery.slides.min.js
[03:48:14] <Cork> just remove the .min from the url
[03:48:29] <Bjerre> oh ofcourse
[03:49:29] <Bjerre> how would you do Cork to call the class without putting it in container div?
[03:49:42] <Bjerre> or do I really have to do that?
[03:49:49] <Bjerre> I'm sorry if I ask stupid questions
[03:50:01] <Cork> Bjerre: if you absolutely need to have the buttons outside the element
[03:50:08] <Cork> either patch the lib
[03:50:35] <Cork> or do the triggering the lib does in your own code
[03:55:36] <Bjerre> I think I need help Cork. Not sure how to do the trigger thing you were talking about.
[03:55:43] <Bjerre> If you got time that would be awesome
[03:57:09] <Cork> var plugin = $('#slides').data('plugin_slidesjs'); plugin.next(plugin.options.navigation.effect);
[03:57:19] <Cork> something like that should trigger the slide to the next image
[03:57:31] <Cork> (completely untested)
[03:57:44] <Bjerre> ok, thanks
[03:57:48] <Bjerre> hehe
[04:03:51] <Bjerre> I love you Cork
[04:04:16] <Cork> i take it work? :D
[04:04:21] <Cork> *worked
[04:04:21] <Bjerre> yes
[04:04:33] <Cork> noce
[04:21:44] <Bjerre> a little question Cork: Would you recommend having the same variable for both in a single function? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/yrte0bk2/
[04:21:50] <Bjerre> it works so no worries, just curious
[04:22:40] <Cork> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/yrte0bk2/1/
[04:22:50] <Cork> opps
[04:23:02] <Cork> you want ready not a simple scope
[04:23:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/yrte0bk2/2/
[04:24:29] <Bjerre> thanks Cork
[04:40:51] <Chulbul> I have a one form, having one billing address section and one checkbox button for shipping address same as billing, when I click on checkbox it automatically pulls billing data and fills it inside shipping fields using jquery. Now I have used formvalidaiton.io plugin for validaiting forms, validation is working fine on both billing and shipping but when it autofills the data after clicking checkbox, validation doesn't work ...
[04:41:00] <Chulbul> it seems as if I have to bind it with live event
[04:42:39] <taplar> what event invokes the validation?
[04:43:26] <Chulbul> click , blur
[04:43:31] <Chulbul> taplar
[04:43:38] <Chulbul> http://formvalidation.io/settings/
[04:44:15] <taplar> so it validates as they change it, not only on submit
[04:45:30] <taplar> if you wish, in your logic that does the copy part, at the end you could $(selector).trigger('blur') the other field to make the validation happen
[04:45:56] <taplar> though i have to wonder, if it was validated in the first area, why you would want to force a second validate in the second, for a copy at least
[04:47:53] <Cork> taplar: it depends a bit, by default it binds on the submit event as far as i know
[04:48:07] <Cork> but it also supports some other events
[04:49:15] <Chulbul> hey Cork , whatsup ..
[04:49:29] <Cork> same same
[04:50:08] <Kartagis> does Conti ever talk here?
[04:50:10] <Kartagis> :D
[04:50:32] <Cork> most ppl never talk in here
[04:50:41] <taplar> which i don't get
[04:50:45] <Chulbul> Cork , its like I have to reinitialize validation or reset it. How do I do that.
[04:51:25] <Cork> Chulbul: no it should do the rechecking again without you doing anything
[04:51:42] <Cork> though if you don't have a valid form it might break things
[04:51:47] <taplar> unless..... is your secondary field dynamically added to the page?
[04:52:31] <Chulbul> fields are not added dynamically, only data from one group of fields to other .. if i don't click on checkbox, validations are workign fine.
[04:52:47] <taplar> but all form fields are already present on page load
[04:52:54] <Chulbul> yes
[04:52:59] <taplar> nvm then, :)
[04:54:15] <Chulbul> taplar , what is nvm :p
[04:54:42] <taplar> i was wondering if you were adding your second area dynamically and thus might be a time of binding issue
[04:55:59] <Chulbul> no .. Im just adding data dynamically on checkbox click on already available fields, but validation plugin is unable to validate it if there are already errors on those particular fields
[04:56:41] <taplar> errors on the origin or the destination?
[04:57:52] <Chulbul> taplar,  there is no error but validation error messages are not going anywhere and due to which I couldn't submit form. I cant see any error on console
[04:58:28] <taplar> Chulbul: can you create a fiddle demonstrating the issue?  would be easier to help then.
[05:00:52] <Chulbul> taplar , ok
[05:13:43] <Bjerre> I'm not sure on how to explain this.... the project that I'm working on is made on a single page but has a lot of animations etc. When you get to the "scene" which has the code provided in this http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/54/ it works as intended. The keybindings for left and right arrow moves between the images (2 in the fiddle only). However, if I leave the "scene" and go back to it again, the last clicked button is still a
[05:13:55] <Bjerre> is there a way to reset the script when going to the new "scene"?
[05:15:23] <Bjerre> I don't want to use window.location.href = window.location.href since there will be a really slow loading time and the background image will disappear for a second
[05:16:50] <taplar> There is a known event that happens when they 'leave the scene'?
[05:18:18] <taplar> you could try to execute .click() on the default element you want to show either on arrival to the scene or leaving the scene so it 'resets'
[05:19:45] <Bjerre> taplar that's true
[05:25:21] <Bjerre> taplar: it didnt help
[05:25:33] <Bjerre> it's like memorizing the last keybind press
[05:25:39] <Bjerre> or where it was when last visited
[05:26:04] <Bjerre> the animation works for the click but using left and right arrow will still go back to the previous state
[05:26:09] <SuperTyp> hi in jQuery mobile how can I add a logo to my header that fits the width and is responsive?
[05:26:18] <Bjerre> and it's not working properly, moving between only 2 of 8 buttons
[05:27:57] <Bjerre> my bet would that this is where it goes wrong taplar  var index = +current - 1;
[05:28:33] <Bjerre> but Im not sure
[05:28:38] <Bjerre> heck, what do I know
[05:29:08] <taplar> when you say 'last visit' your navigating away from the page?
[05:30:04] <Bjerre> nah, it's quite hard to explain. I'm using a really easy editor (tumult hype) and they use scenes to navigate between. The problem is that it's acting like a onepage, not giving different hashtags
[05:30:20] <taplar> so it's a spa?
[05:30:23] <Bjerre> yea
[05:31:08] <Bjerre> therefor it's impossible for me to show how it works in jsfiddle
[05:31:13] <Bjerre> and where the problem is
[05:31:42] <taplar> and doing a forced click on the default button didn't reset it?
[05:31:59] <taplar> or you just have arrows?
[05:32:29] <Bjerre> it only started the animation and show the correct image, but when I use the arrows or click on the next/back buttons it will go to the image and button that was pressed in the beginning
[05:33:03] <taplar> ah, ok, do that, but also re-do: current = $buttons.eq(0).data('index');
[05:33:07] <taplar> without the leading var
[05:33:41] <Bjerre> on "scene" load or in the main code?
[05:33:46] <taplar> you should probably doing that already on clicking a button, otherwise your next and previous are already jacked up
[05:34:51] <taplar> which it looks like you already are: current = $(this).data('index');
[05:35:58] <Bjerre> hmm ye taplar
[05:36:01] <Bjerre> this is really strange
[05:36:30] <Axy> How can I get the text in an element without getting the text in children it contains? Here is an example: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqaZWw I would like to get text in "containers" but not the <a>'s.
[05:38:37] <notchris> Axy: .not(‘a’)
[05:38:44] <Axy> O_O
[05:38:50] <Axy> checking! notchris
[05:39:29] <notchris> .not(‘ specify elements or selectors here’) will generally deselect those items from a larger selection
[05:39:40] <Chulbul> taplar , how about sharing live site url on your private chat window :p . I dont know but on jsfiddle its not working.
[05:39:44] <notchris> As long as they exist when you’e attempting to specify
[05:41:30] <taplar> Chulbul: not working?  meaning the logic isn't working or you are unable to reproduce error on fiddle?  you can share with the room.  no one bites, :)
[05:41:34] <SuperTyp> hi in jQuery mobile how can I add a logo to my header that fits the width and is responsive?
[05:42:05] <Chulbul> when I add my js on jsfiddle it doesn't save anything , it redirects to main page, but when I don;t add js .. I was able to update it
[05:43:01] <Chulbul> taplar .. no one bites :D hahaha
[05:43:05] <Axy> notchris, can you apply it to my exampe? I can't seem to make it work.
[05:43:43] <notchris> Axy: Where’s you example
[05:43:49] <notchris> your
[05:43:56] <taplar> Chulbul: what's the link to the fiddle?
[05:43:57] <Axy> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NqaZWw this one
[05:44:01] <Chulbul> taplar , http://superpac.qa-staging.com/ .. click on get started and you will be able to see a popup with form and validaition ;)
[05:44:53] <notchris> Axy: You want to select only the a's?
[05:44:55] <notchris> or not the a's
[05:45:00] <Axy> not the a's
[05:45:01] <Chulbul> taplar , when you will be on treasure tab, first click save and then click on checkbox, you will be able to see whats going on there
[05:45:08] <Axy> I want to get the text in the divs, but excluding a's
[05:45:35] <Axy> basically, I want to get the text in an element excludig it's children's content (but only the element) notchris
[05:45:40] <Axy> but excluding a's also work
[05:45:55] <Axy> (I'm asking both because maybe both have different solutions) notchris
[05:46:07] <taplar> Chulbul: alright, trying to go to the treasurer tab, net is being slow right now
[05:46:18] <Chulbul> taplar , ok
[05:46:40] <taplar> oh, i have to use the arrow
[05:46:44] <taplar> arrows
[05:46:55] <Chulbul> yes
[05:47:23] <Chulbul> click save, there will be erros then click checkbox .. it will pouplate the fields and then again click save
[05:47:34] <Chulbul> it suppos to submit the form but it doesn;t
[05:47:39] <Chulbul> thats the problem
[05:49:25] <taplar> interesting
[05:49:44] <Axy> notchris, should I wait for your reply :3 ?
[05:50:01] <Chulbul> taplar yes it is :)
[05:50:01] <notchris> Axy: Yea
[05:50:08] <Axy> ok then
[05:50:10] * Axy is waiting
[05:50:29] <Chulbul> * chulbul is also waiting :D
[05:52:27] <Chulbul> taplar , are you still looking into it ?
[05:52:37] <taplar> Chulbul: yep
[05:52:50] <Chulbul> ok
[05:52:56] <toomus> Hi all
[05:53:13] <Chulbul> Hi toomus
[05:53:56] <toomus> I have some form, which is loaded by AJAX
[05:54:04] <taplar> Chulbul: what did you bind to for your validation? #getStartedForm ?
[05:54:25] <toomus> By I can't trigger submit() on it
[05:54:57] <notchris> Axy: http://jsfiddle.net/populartruth/xvd2t3mp/
[05:55:25] <notchris> Axy: Or, if you want to select only text nodes, http://jsfiddle.net/populartruth/xvd2t3mp/1/
[05:56:19] <Axy> notchris <3
[05:56:26] <Axy> I owe you a milkshake
[05:56:48] <Chulbul> taplar , hey gotta go now, will catch you tommorow :)
[05:57:02] <notchris> Axy: Nah you’re good man. IF you want to apply CSS to the text nodes, wrap them in a span or p or div first
[05:57:14] <notchris> Axy: It’s bad practice to style plain text nodes
[05:57:19] <Axy> thanks!
[05:57:20] <Axy> will do
[05:57:23] <notchris> ;)
[05:57:33] <Axy> I just needed to reach the content, but that's also great to know
[05:57:43] <notchris> For sure, and just for reference
[05:57:54] <Axy> thank you once again
[05:57:57] <notchris> You’re selecting text nodes because nodeType = 3 means text nodes
[05:58:05] <notchris> You could also do !== 1
[05:58:15] <notchris> 3 is more specific
[05:58:23] <toomus> Why this click handler can't find form loaded with AJAX? http://pastie.org/10253008
[05:58:50] <notchris> toomus: We need full example
[05:58:56] <notchris> toomus: Make a fiddle
[05:59:49] <taplar> toomus: did you try putting a console.log in that function to make sure it is executing?
[06:00:08] <taplar> toomus: and technically you only need #save-btn on your binder
[06:00:34] <taplar> toomus: ids are unique to a page view
[06:00:35] <toomus> taplar: Yes, it executes, but  $('#change-name-form') is empty
[06:00:57] <toomus> but when i try to run this code from consolw, it works
[06:02:11] <taplar> yeah, at this point we'd need a fiddle
[06:02:28] <notchris> -_-
[06:03:59] <toomus> taplar: If you know Ruby on Rails :P
[06:05:52] <taplar> i do not
[06:09:29] <toomus> taplar: Scenario: User clicks button to edit chat thread name. Then with AJAX loaded is form, which allows to type new name. And then I try to submit it this way http://pastie.org/10253008#
[06:11:42] <toomus> taplar: Click is executed, but form can't be found
[06:12:34] <taplar> toomus: but you are able to execute the selector in the console and it will find it
[06:12:35] <toomus> taplar: But straight from concole I can trigger submit() on this form
[06:12:53] <toomus> taplar: Yes, this is strange
[06:13:52] <taplar> toomus: right, and given that your using a delegate binding, which should help prevent timing issues, it seems your still having a timing issue.  thus us asking for a fiddle to see more
[06:15:07] <toomus> taplar: It looks like code inside click handler doesn't see DOM changes
[06:17:44] <toomus> taplar: Or maybe I'm loading form in wrong way?
[06:18:36] <toomus> taplar: http://pastie.org/private/wv4n7eqdz0dfjrocimj8va
[06:24:30] <toomus> taplar: changing content of the element with .html() function it's a good solution?
[06:25:18] <taplar> toomus: that's in your js file?
[06:25:35] <Bjerre> Someone who knows how to reset the javascript on a single page application? Hard to show on jsfiddle but what happens is that the previous animation and select is still active if I leave the scene and comes back in. The back and next button also acts really wierd, skipping between only two buttons (8 buttons in the real project) http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/54/
[06:26:47] <toomus> taplar: The response is rendered in server side
[06:27:13] <taplar> toomus: but is that code in a .js file or apart of a servlet page?
[06:27:47] <DaFiN> hello, i am trying to use cycle2 carousel .. overlays in specific
[06:27:58] <taplar> toomus: it looks like your trying to intermingle js code with servlet commands
[06:28:01] <DaFiN> but, it seems to not update the data on screen
[06:29:54] <toomus> taplar: It's not the problem. Ruby on Rails allows you to mix server side code (eg. data loaded from DB) with JS. This is called js.erb
[06:31:32] <notchris> If you use .hide() on a container
[06:31:39] <notchris> And it contains a bunch of elements, including form elements
[06:31:50] <notchris> Can I then show() a specific element
[06:31:55] <notchris> Without showing the parent again
[06:32:17] <toomus> taplar: OK, .html() function is the issue
[06:32:23] <taplar> toomus: interesting.  anyway, html() is a valid way to change the contents of an element
[06:32:49] <toomus> taplar: When I change it to .replaceWith() it works
[06:33:44] <taplar> replaceWith will replace #thread-title with the html you give it
[06:33:49] <taplar> is that desired?
[06:34:30] <toomus> taplar: ups, you are right :P
[06:35:36] <Bjerre> taplar: I successfully reset the animation on the scene load with  $('.btn').removeClass('active');  $('.textanimation').removeClass('textanimationforward');  I still need the current .btn targeted to be removed as well
[06:35:38] <Bjerre> any idea?
[06:35:46] <Bjerre> we're so close of getting it working :)
[06:36:38] <Bjerre> and you might wonder why? Well, what happens when I load the scene again is that when using prev and next buttons it will move between two images only which is really odd. Crazy bug
[06:36:53] <Bjerre> and it also starts on the previous clicked on before changing scene
[06:37:02] <Bjerre> which can not be removed on a new click
[06:37:11] <taplar> Bjerre: and you tried $('.btn:first-child').click() to start on the first button again?
[06:37:30] <taplar> or :first, i forget which
[06:37:54] <Bjerre> dont want it to start on first button though taplar but yes, something similar to that I tried. more like $('.btn-one').click()
[06:38:47] <Bjerre> it doesnt matter which button I press when starting the scene again because it will still bug out and think we're on the previous button before leaving the scene
[06:39:58] <Bjerre> to be more specific, it will accept the new click and start on that one, but the prev and next buttons act differently (memorized the last clicked before leaving scene)
[06:40:10] <taplar> i think i put this before, but maybe not.  did you try re-initializing your current variable again?
[06:40:28] <Bjerre> it's on load taplar
[06:40:31] <Bjerre> on scene load
[06:40:33] <Bjerre> so yes
[06:41:19] <Bjerre> this is what happens when I try to implement real code into an editor for newstarters
[06:41:23] <Bjerre> :/
[06:41:30] <taplar> what do you mean load?
[06:42:10] <Bjerre> the javascript loads when spa loads the new "scene"
[06:42:21] <Bjerre> it might not be on every load though
[06:42:24] <Bjerre> since it's variables
[06:42:25] <Bjerre> and global
[06:42:37] <Bjerre> maybe that's the problem
[06:42:45] <taplar> so in your fiddle, the top line where you var current = blah....  is actually inside a function that happens multiple times?
[06:43:09] <Bjerre> thats right
[06:43:18] <taplar> ah, well then
[06:43:27] <Bjerre> so its inside a function to be more specific
[06:44:00] <taplar> Bjerre: are your bindings also in that function?
[06:44:08] <Bjerre> everything is inside that function
[06:44:11] <taplar> AH!
[06:44:14] <taplar> bad bad bad!
[06:44:15] <taplar> :D
[06:44:19] <Bjerre> haha
[06:44:28] <taplar> your binding multiple times to the variables
[06:44:29] <Bjerre> well, that's how you add javascripts in tumult hype
[06:44:36] <Bjerre> yea
[06:44:39] <taplar> also, the old bindings will keep their references to the old variables
[06:44:48] <Bjerre> sounds like thats it
[06:44:49] <taplar> so that's your prob
[06:47:18] <Bjerre> gonna see what I can do taplar, give me a couple of minutes :)
[06:47:34] <taplar> cool, i shall continue devouring my oatmeal
[06:58:28] <Bent0> Could someone explain what the function (resp) does in this snippet?
[06:58:29] <Bent0> 			$.post(SERVERROOT + "ajax_release-admin?action=dodelete"+ids, function(resp){
[06:58:29] <Bent0> 				location.reload(true);
[06:58:29] <Bent0> 			});
[06:59:37] <taplar> that callback is the success function
[07:00:24] <Bent0> But what does the ¨resp¨ do? Check if there is any http response?
[07:00:41] <taplar> resp is the data returned from the request, i believe
[07:00:54] <taplar> if there was any
[07:01:01] <Bent0> ok so it just checks if there was any response whatsoever and then reload
[07:01:22] <taplar> doesn't check.  as your not using the resp variable, you could take it out
[07:02:05] <Bent0> roger understand it now :) cheers
[07:07:51] <notchris> How do I show an element within a hidden container
[07:07:58] <notchris> The container will remain hidden
[07:08:20] <notchris> I tried to append the element outside of the hidden container, no luck
[07:08:34] <Cork> notchris: you move it out of the hidden container
[07:08:54] <notchris> Cork: The element remains hidden though
[07:09:11] <Cork> you can't show a child of an element that is display: none, visibility: hidden/collapse or opacity: 0
[07:09:23] <Cork> notchris: as long as the element is a child, it will
[07:09:34] <Cork> like i just said, no way around that
[07:09:39] <notchris> No way?
[07:09:47] <Cork> yes
[07:09:51] <notchris> That sucks
[07:09:59] <decx> if you already tried appending outside then you just had a mistake in there
[07:10:02] <Cork> only two ways to do it is 1. move the child out of the hidden parent
[07:10:13] <Cork> or 2. remove the "hiding" of the parent
[07:14:35] <joe9_> Can anyone please help with this? http://dpaste.com/0SAG64C is the script. It
[07:14:36] <joe9_>         does not proceed further if I uncomment the line // var localJQuery =
[07:14:36] <joe9_>         jQuery.noConflict(); When that line is commented, I get all the alerts/console.log messages. the script does not proceed further even with just this line: jQuery.noConflict(); I tried with @grant none or without the @grant
[07:15:43] <joe9_> it is probably a greasemonkey quirk. Just want to check if anyone here has experience with it.
[07:15:50] <Cork> joe9_: that looks like a pure greasemonkey question
[07:15:55] <notchris> Ahhh
[07:15:59] <notchris> TY guys
[07:16:00] <Cork> cause ya, that should work
[07:16:05] <joe9_> Cork: ok, thanks.
[07:17:54] <decx> iife that
[07:18:32] <zlude> Hello! I need to change a field based in a value from another field, so I've used  $("#id").change, however that's just changing when I 'click' out from the field, how can I fix that? Can I use some way to change without 'clicking out' needed? like "real time changing", thanks.
[07:18:41] <decx> like what is .query?
[07:18:59] <taplar> zlude: look at keydown or keyup
[07:19:08] <Cork> zlude: on('input', func)
[07:19:14] <Cork> and no not keydown/up
[07:19:24] <taplar> oh, interesting
[07:19:34] <decx> yes, del and backspace are also keydown
[07:19:35] <Cork> ?mdn input event
[07:19:44] <zlude> Cork, thank you! and thank you too anyway taplar.
[07:19:50] <Cork> and left right
[07:20:02] <Cork> but the big problem is that paste doesn't trigger keydown/up
[07:20:20] <Cork> (or cut)
[07:20:31] <decx> it's a can of worms alright
[07:24:01] <zlude> Cork, is that $( "#id" ).on( "input", function() { .. } ?
[07:24:11] <Cork> })
[07:24:13] <Cork> but ya
[07:25:02] <zlude> I'm doing $( "#id" ).on( "input", function() { console.log("changed"); }); Nothing happens at console
[07:25:18] <decx> fiddle up
[07:26:00] <Cork> zlude: http://jsfiddle.net/x08uu0wp/
[07:32:48] <zlude> Cork, I found the problem.. Look: http://jsfiddle.net/x08uu0wp/1/
[07:33:02] <zlude> Any ideas how to fix that?
[07:33:52] <Cork> sounds like the lib you're using is using return false; or stopPropagation
[07:33:59] <Cork> and... you would have to modify the lib to fix it
[07:34:00] <decx> noted, maskMoney is an event hog
[07:34:25] <decx> https://github.com/plentz/jquery-maskmoney/issues/44
[07:35:47] <Cork> ya, it uses return
[07:36:04] <decx> no changes in 3 years
[07:37:08] <Bjerre> taplar: I'm not fully understanding how to get it running
[07:37:34] <Bjerre> taplar: I tried adding the code to an external .js and wrap it in the head but that didnt work
[07:41:00] <taplar> Bjerre: so are you only binding once now?
[07:45:51] <Bjerre> no taplar I'm not sure on how to split the code up for onload and not
[07:46:07] <Bjerre> some parts are needed on the scene, otherwise it wont work at all
[07:47:17] <taplar> Bjerre: what do you mean 'on the scene'?
[07:48:45] <Bjerre> taplar: In my editor all the different "pages" are called scenes. The pages or scenes will be combined to a SPA when preview or export. I'm not sure on how to describe it
[07:49:23] <Bjerre> to the scenes/pages I can add javascript for "on scene load", "on scene unload" "click" etc etc
[07:50:05] <taplar> Bjerre: so your scenes are included javascript is what your saying
[07:50:22] <Bjerre> I guess so
[07:51:40] <Bjerre> it looks like this: function foo(hypeDocument, taplar element, event) { /*INSERT JSFIDDLE CODE HERE*/ }
[07:51:41] <taplar> Bjerre: but you've moved the one piece into an external js file and included it in the head you said
[07:51:48] <Bjerre> yes I did
[07:52:17] <Bjerre> haha didnt mean to type taplar
[07:52:22] <Bjerre> but you get the drift
[07:52:31] <taplar> Bjerre: ok, so are your scenes added dynamically or are they all there on page load?
[07:52:48] <Bjerre> they are added dynamically
[07:53:05] <Bjerre> so it starts with scene 1, then I can bind a button to start scene 2
[07:53:10] <Bjerre> or "jump to"
[07:53:30] <taplar> once you start scene 2, you perform an ajax request to load it and add it to the page
[07:58:08] <taplar> ?
[07:58:15] <Bjerre> I'm not sure taplar
[07:58:28] <Bjerre> the editor is so strict in what to do and not, I have no idea how it actually works
[07:58:42] <taplar> lol, your killin me smalls
[07:58:42] <Bjerre> that's the problem, I started out with this and now I'm stuck
[07:59:00] <Bjerre> after this project I wont do anything with it again
[07:59:01] <Bjerre> ever
[07:59:17] <taplar> ok, lets back up.  that function that does the binding.  when do you call it
[07:59:44] <Bjerre> I call it on the same "scene" of what you see in the jsfiddle
[07:59:53] <Bjerre> it doesnt look like that though but you get the idea
[08:00:10] <Bjerre> I tried to load it on the previous scene but then it wont work
[08:00:18] <Bjerre> which is really weird, it should be global since it's variables
[08:00:22] <taplar> but what causes it?  when you switch to the scene or what?
[08:00:38] <Bjerre> yes, it's an onload when the scene starts
[08:00:45] <taplar> anything with var in front of it is a local variable
[08:01:23] <taplar> ok, so that's your issue
[08:01:30] <hk3380> i want to make an enhancement to flickr to show me the last message of a thread when i hover over it. what's the best way to do it? i started with a userscript, but it turns out it needs OAuth calls to get the post message and that means I'd have to expose the secret_key provided by the API. what's an alternative that works for my case?
[08:01:42] <taplar> what you might try to do is after you have done it once, remove that event from the onload
[08:02:07] <Bjerre> that's the point taplar, there is nothing that removes it
[08:02:11] <Bjerre> even if its only onload
[08:02:18] <Bjerre> some stuff will still be there
[08:02:54] <Bjerre> so I need the reverse thing to add to on scene unload
[08:03:16] <Bjerre> or not reverse, but something that resets it
[08:03:20] <Bjerre> or removes it
[08:03:38] <Bjerre> taplar this shitty application is driving me crazy
[08:03:44] <taplar> in that case try this
[08:03:56] <Bjerre> shitty I mean tumult hype
[08:03:58] <taplar> in that function store your handlers in variables
[08:04:02] <Bjerre> not the one you coded 99% of
[08:04:08] <taplar> store them in global variables, maybe even with localStorage
[08:04:20] <taplar> so that your bind like $(selector).on('click', variable1)
[08:04:31] <joe9_> Is there some function to check if jquery is running/loaded fine? just something to check if it is ok to start using jquery functions?
[08:04:38] <taplar> then in your unload event you can do $(selector).off('click', variable1)
[08:04:47] <taplar> to remove the event handler
[08:08:12] <taplar> joe9_: you can do (typeof jQuery !== 'undefined') i would think
[08:09:10] <taplar> joe9_: but if your wanting to make sure it's ok to start your code, just wrap it in a $(function(){  /* go for it */ })  and it won't execute until all elements are loaded
[08:09:46] <taplar> joe9_: or $(document).ready(function(){ /* go for it */ }); depending on coding tastes
[08:09:54] <taplar> same thing though
[08:25:12] <workerbeetwo> Hi. Id like to have a section/pane split with a movable "bar" to resize the sections. is there a jquery plugin for this?
[08:27:34] <Bjerre> ehm tapl
[08:27:40] <Bjerre> no he's gone :(
[08:31:15] <Bjerre> taplar: I solved it
[08:31:23] <Bjerre> it's so silly
[08:31:30] <taplar> awesome
[08:31:34] <Bjerre> I removed var on var current = $buttons.eq(0).data('index');
[08:32:05] <taplar> right, that will make it a global variable
[08:32:26] <Bjerre> no the opposite right?
[08:32:34] <taplar> no, var makes a variable local
[08:32:38] <Bjerre> yes
[08:32:40] <Bjerre> but I removed it
[08:32:46] <Bjerre> I removed var
[08:32:50] <taplar> right
[08:33:06] <taplar> we're agreeing, :)
[08:33:09] <Bjerre> funny how that made it work
[08:33:13] <Bjerre> haha cool
[08:33:40] <Bjerre> and it starts on nothing now, which I wanted
[08:33:47] <taplar> you most likely still have the issue of multiple bindings, which is not good, but now they are all using the same global variable
[08:33:52] <Bjerre> it also starts on btn-one when I press right arrow
[08:33:59] <Bjerre> yea
[08:34:21] <Bjerre> are you good with css?
[08:34:48] <taplar> as a one eyed man
[08:35:16] <taplar> what's the q?
[08:35:17] <Uhkis> so no 3D? ;)
[08:35:26] <taplar> i'm king in a blind world, :D
[08:35:26] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/ouf4L7x4/
[08:35:31] <Bjerre> it's not obeying overflow

[08:36:42] <Bjerre> I picked the school with .net

[08:36:56] <Bjerre> if you remember
[08:37:16] <taplar> cool
[08:37:24] <Mooniac> how do I get the selected choice in a selectmenu?
[08:37:54] <Mooniac> instance method? selectWidget?
[08:38:52] <taplar> Bjerre: what overflow are you trying to enforce?  you got width and height 100% on that guy
[08:39:44] <Bjerre> ok taplar. Well it's the background-container class that is supposed to be inside the sphere
[08:40:28] <hlvwrk> anybody?
[08:41:02] <Bjerre> did you even ask something hlvwrk ?
[08:41:09] <hlvwrk> wrong chan
[08:41:11] <hlvwrk> sorry.

[08:44:36] <Bjerre> Uhkis: are you doing 3D animations with css3?
[08:44:40] <taplar> Bjerre: not sure about your css question.  i think i know what your trying to do, but not sure
[08:45:12] <Bjerre> taplar: the old version: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dtqzu7a/
[08:45:19] <Bjerre> as you can see it's not moving sub pixel level
[08:45:42] <Bjerre> so it's really not smooth
[08:45:52] <Bjerre> dubstep effect ftl
[08:56:36] <joe9_> When working with jquery, is there a recommended firefox version? 38.1 is the latest version in my distro. Not sure if that would be too new for jquery.
[08:58:30] <taplar> joe9_: http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[08:58:39] <joe9_> taplar: thanks.
[09:15:37] <Mooniac> how can I get the actual string value for $( "#selector" ).selectmenu( "option" ). I need to be able to process the selected choice in the event handler for the selection event
[09:26:45] <gnarf> cc everyone: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/issues/104
[09:33:06] <taplar> Mooniac: http://jsfiddle.net/6w399hxy/
[09:35:23] <Mooniac> great, thanks, it's .selectmenu().val()
[09:35:50] <Uhkis> gnarf: doesnt smaller version of that already exist (at least on the irc pages)
[09:36:04] <gnarf> Uhkis: yes, it would be replaced with this new one
[10:12:51] <Es0teric> how do i move an element from one area in the dom to another?
[10:14:11] <taplar> Es0teric: i believe inserting it into a new location will automatically remove it from the original place.  otherwise you can use $.detach()
[10:14:18] <taplar> ?api detach
[10:14:24] <taplar> !api detach
[10:14:32] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[10:26:56] <arthurvr> yo everybody

[10:33:25] <Bootinbull> has anyone used Fancybox and had trouble getting it to close when trying to use $.fancybox.close() for an onclick() event?
[10:39:07] <taplar> Bootinbull: fiddle?
[10:39:45] <burba> hello has anyone experience in open source here
[10:40:08] <saransh__> Hi, i am having a issue with sticky js in safari
[10:40:22] <burba> I would like some easy tickets to get started with
[10:40:38] <saransh__> http://beaconstac.staging.wpengine.com/beacon-101/
[10:40:52] <saransh__> when i scroll down, i get a little jitter in
[10:40:58] <saransh__> sidebar and header
[10:41:09] <saransh__> where as in chrome and firefox it works fine
[10:41:26] <saransh__> can, anyone please suggest a solution?
[10:41:38] <Bootinbull> taplar: I'm at work right now (it's another project) so I don't have the code. Basically, it opens shows a form. The button has a validate() function in the onclick as well (and it comes back when info in the form). The form gets submitted via an ajax call - the form submits... but the fancybox will not close.
[10:56:09] <saransh__> please can anyone suggest what's the issue with safari?
[10:56:31] <saransh__> why sticky js doesn't work well in safari?
[10:57:03] <Uhkis> probably because safari is worse than ie
[10:57:40] <saransh__> <Uhkis>: Please can you visit http://beaconstac.staging.wpengine.com/beacon-101/
[10:57:50] <saransh__> there is a jitter in header and sidebar
[10:57:54] <saransh__> when i scroll down
[10:58:09] <saransh__> where as it works great in chrome in firefox
[10:58:30] <Uhkis> sorry, i dont have safari
[11:10:24] <zsoc> Alright. So I'm using a custom implementation of ketchup (which hasn't been touched in a billion years...) - what's the 'current' suggestion for this sort of thing? A relatively extensible form validation lib but that comes out the box usable?
[11:48:36] <lindii_> anyone using the dropzone plugin knows how to access custom attributes?
[11:51:18] <taplar> custom attributes?
[11:53:54] <lindii_> taplar: yeah like $("div#container").dropzone({params: {user: $(this).data("id")}});
[11:54:17] <lindii_> i cant access $(this).data("id")
[11:54:42] <taplar> in what context are you using 'this' ?
[11:55:56] <lindii_> <div id="container" data-id="1">
[11:57:05] <taplar> i mean what does the function look like that is doing that dropzone statement
[11:58:56] <lindii_> taplar: when i log this i get [Dropzone, jquery: "1.11.2", constructor: function, selector: "", toArray: function, get: function…]
[12:00:38] <taplar> again, what does the function look like that you are doing that statement in?  it will determine what 'this' is
[12:07:27] <taplar> or you might try something like... var $container = $('#container'); $container.dropzone({params:{user:$container.data('id')}});
[12:12:28] <lindii_> taplar: awesome that works
[12:13:02] <lindii_> taplar: guess im confused using "this"
[12:13:45] <taplar> k
[12:14:20] <taplar> 'this' is relative to the context, for instance in a function, this would reference the function, or object the function is attached to
[12:14:56] <taplar> for a selector event handler $(selector).on('click', function(){ /* this in here is the object found in the selector */ });
[12:15:15] <taplar> so you have to be careful about how you use it
[12:15:43] <taplar> by storing it in a variable $container, you solidified at that point what this should be, so later when you used the variable, it didn't have to figure out how to interpret 'this'
[12:16:07] <lindii_> taplar: yeah now it makes sense
[12:51:13] <alaing> hi
[12:52:45] <taplar> yo
[12:55:41] <rindolf> alaing: hi , how are you?
[12:55:55] <alaing> rindolf: good thanks, you?
[12:56:23] <rindolf> alaing: I've built a new llvm package for Mageia Linux Cauldron.
[12:56:32] <rindolf> alaing: it was time consuming.
[12:56:36] <alaing> llvm?
[12:57:44] <rindolf> alaing: Low-Level-Virtual Machine.
[12:57:57] <rindolf> alaing: it's a compiler framework.
[12:57:58] <alaing> ah....sweet
[12:58:21] <alaing> rindolf: yeah could imagine that to be time consuming
[12:59:25] <rindolf> alaing: yes.
[13:01:22] <alaing> rindolf: rather quiet in here
[13:02:14] <GetAJorb> HI.  How do i make a query from a previous query like $("form").("input")
[13:02:18] <GetAJorb> ?
[13:02:27] <alaing> query?
[13:02:33] <rindolf> GetAJorb: there's a method for that.
[13:02:34] <GetAJorb> selection?
[13:02:38] <rindolf> GetAJorb: something like .select
[13:02:53] <shoky> .find
[13:03:11] <alaing> $('form').find('input')
[13:03:17] <GetAJorb> Thanks guys!!!
[13:03:42] <alaing> if you need to go back to form then use .end()
[13:03:57] <GetAJorb> Oh, neat
[13:04:43] <GetAJorb> but I was thinking of assinging them to tow different vars... if I assign 'form' to x and 'input' to y will x still work to refer to 'form'
[13:04:52] <GetAJorb> *two
[13:06:29] <GetAJorb> just wondering if the reference gets broken since I call find('input') on it...
[13:06:34] <GetAJorb> I'll test it out
[13:09:05] <alaing> GetAJorb: I woudl advise you to cache the selectors if you goign to use them more than once
[13:10:04] <alaing> like var $form = $('form'), $input = $form.find('input'), $selectElem = $form.find('select')
[13:10:35] <GetAJorb> Yeah that's what I wanted to do
[13:10:38] <GetAJorb> :)
[13:11:04] <GetAJorb> sorry I was unclear
[13:11:38] <alaing> GetAJorb: no problem hopefully that solves your issue and you can go forth and create some more awesomeness
[13:12:29] <GetAJorb> I will do my best!
[13:35:15] <hcker2000> if I have a jquery object with a bunch of top level nodes how can I get a count of nodes of a specific type?
[13:35:28] <hcker2000> in this example I need to find all root level div's

[13:53:19] <morlenxus> Hey, can someone help me with positioning a jqueryui dialog? I tryed using position, but this seems to be somehow unexepected: http://office.5monkeys.kicks-ass.net/test.php
[13:55:19] <ganeshaditya1> Hey, I am making a blog using Jquery and Flask and I am struck at this point. See at the homepage of my blog, there will be a listing of all the blog posts. Now each blog post is put in a panel which has a lot of html elements. I thought of having a dummy div and using the append method on it. I was wondering if there is a elegant way to handle this.
[13:56:16] <ganeshaditya1> I mean constructing a string with all the html code for each panel in  a loop and then calling a append method on the dummy div.
[13:56:56] <ganeshaditya1> Something like panel_code = "<div ...." followed by $('#dummy').append(panel_code);
[13:58:21] <ganeshaditya1> Wondering if there is a better way to do this.
[13:59:31] <ngharo> use some kind of templating
[13:59:45] <ngharo> handlebars.js perhaps
[14:00:47] <ganeshaditya1> Thanks I will look into it.
[14:02:04] <morlenxus> ngharo: Can you help me with the position issue?
[14:23:23] <ngharo> morlenxus: looks like you already fixed it?
[14:24:06] <morlenxus> ngharo: Yeah, i'm on the way.
[14:24:12] <morlenxus> Thanks anyway.
[14:54:14] <cjohnson> hcker2000: mashcraft the solution is to use .filter() on the set and then count it
[14:55:22] <cjohnson> ;)
[14:56:04] <cjohnson> I have a question for others, using jquery validator I want to add a custom method and then I want that method to be usable via form node attributes (I don't use config objects just inline html config)
[14:56:08] <cjohnson> how can I do that?
[14:56:55] <cjohnson> hcker2000: if you have a partial dom you have to add it to a temporary placeholder element because $(aBunchOfHtml) will only parse the first node in the HTML afaik
[14:56:58] <cjohnson> so something like this
[14:57:11] <cjohnson> $('<div>').append(aBunchOfHTml).find('> div').length
[19:10:00] <tekhneek> I have a jCrop/jQuery related question. Is that acceptable to ask in here?
[19:21:50] <tekhneek> I'm using jcrop to crop images on the client side. When I start to adjust the crop, the image disappears in the preview pane. Has anyone had this issue before?
[19:58:26] <aro> when pulling .html() for a node, will the child elements .data properties be pulled also?
[20:01:10] <aro> ne1 know
[20:05:00] <shoky> aro: if you mean data set by calling .data() then no
[20:06:16] <aro> what can i do to pull that?
[20:06:33] <aro> we are pulling an element via .html(), and for some reason, none of that stuff is there
[20:14:56] <aro> hello?
[20:15:41] <aro> i am passing an object to a function by reference, that function adds .data() parameters
[20:15:53] <aro> for some reason, they arent available in the original function after the fact
[20:17:17] <arc_> isn't the whole point of setting data that you then reference it by calling data
[20:17:40] <arc_> not that you insert some string into your html and then try to parse it out of the whole innerhtml later
[20:21:02] <aro> What should i do then?
[20:21:29] <aro> I am passing an object, $col, to another function, which then adds .data() properties. Shouldnt these be available in the calling function after the fact?
[20:23:19] <arc_> use data() to read it back out where you need it
[20:24:00] <aro> i did, it is returned as null
[20:24:38] <arc_> okay, can you set up a test case on jsfiddle
[20:24:44] <aro> ok
[23:16:55] <inthl> I'd need a hint where to find docs or a tutorial for the following responsive layout problem: there are two columns, say 1 and 2, and they are being displayed as: [1 | 2 ] ...that is easy for sure. now I'd like, for say mobile devices, that these cols are one below the other, ...what is easy as well. but the difference is that it should be the 2-column first, then the 1-column, as in:
[23:16:59] <inthl> 2
[23:17:00] <inthl> 1
[23:17:13] <intent> What is it called when there is an element at the top of the site that is hidden until you press something to reveal it, then it drops in like this (lock icon in the middle): http://www.vbtise.com/
[23:17:14] <inthl> ...and in the wider view, as mentioned, 1 | 2
