[00:11:22] <ranum> anybody?
[03:20:13] <anli> Is there a way to not emit an event when I switch to developer tools?
[03:20:24] <anli> (chrome)
[03:25:20] <anli> Why is on_blur not defined in https://jsfiddle.net/csahkmqh/ ?
[03:29:41] <Cork> anli: no, cause focus moves when you do
[03:30:04] <anli> Cork: Yes, and I want to have the browser intact when I inspect elements
[03:30:08] <Cork> anli: what you can do in some cases (much harder in other) is to pause the page with a keyboard shortcut before you move the mouse
[03:30:27] <anli> ah, true
[03:30:27] <Cork> but ya, it doesn't always work
[03:31:45] <anli> Ah, F8 seems to blur before pausing
[03:31:58] <anli> or some other event...
[04:01:50] <sonu_nk> hi there.. $.extend( true, object1, object2 ); is giving me $ is undefinded.. other all script working ..
[04:05:21] <Cork> sonu_nk: you most likely call it before jquery has been loaded
[04:09:23] <sonu_nk> Cork, its in plugin and i am trying to fix this issue.. becuase the plugin not working just with issue..
[04:10:18] <sonu_nk> Cork,  jquery is loading in header and this script is is in footer...
[04:10:53] <Cork> sonu_nk: if $ is undefined, then either 1. the plugin is written correctly and assumes that $ is jquery globally, or 2. jquery isn't loaded yet
[04:11:12] <Cork> uhhh... *is written incorrectly* XD
[04:11:46] <Cork> all plugins should always be wrapped in (function($) {})(jQuery);
[04:11:53] <sonu_nk> Cork, go it.. more var object = $.extend({}, object1, object2); that was present in jquery 1.12 version ?
[04:12:07] <Cork> it has always been pressent
[06:23:02] <[E]sc> i'm using jquery to checkValidity for a form and prevent it from sending unless it's valid.  it will check the first require input field but then it keeps looping on that first one, even after I've typed in the box.  is this a bug ? or something wrong with my code?
[06:42:54] <salad>  i have these parts that i want to have on the same page, one is this https://jsfiddle.net/h8fm6v7c/37/ and the other is this https://www.cssscript.com/demo/css-flexbox-image-carousel/ but when i put them together something is broken https://jsfiddle.net/geaj4aLx/
[06:43:06] <salad> jquery seems broken and idk why
[07:01:06] <Cork> [E]sc: show the code (jsfiddle) so we can check
[07:01:57] <[E]sc> Cork, actually fixed it thanks.  I had to add oninput to cancel out the oninvalid for the custom validity message.
[07:02:39] <Cork> salad: jsfiddle expects the content of the body in html, not the entire page
[07:03:01] <Cork> so ya, the html is broken and all kind of things will blow up then
[07:03:18] <salad> seems that jquery was not enabled
[07:03:24] <salad> now it works
[07:07:03] <Cork> salad: ya, that too, but you really need to fix the html part anyway
[07:59:30] <salad> yes, but that comes after things work with the jquery, the first part is just pasted, scripts and css included.
[07:59:46] <salad> and now they do, i added more stuff etc
[08:17:01] <ranum> hello - does anybody know if elements that are dragged using jQuery UI can maintain their responsiveness within a resized browser? The elements often seem to end up completely off the screen.
[08:17:51] <MikeD_> can you ask that again, maybe with a fiddle example ?
[08:18:31] <Cork> from memory (though it was many years since i did it) yes you can
[08:18:48] <Cork> though it might require some fiddling with the css
[08:30:15] <ranum> Here's a very rudimentary example. If you drag that image to the far right, it's completely cut off the page when the browser resizes https://jsfiddle.net/nrcfexm2/
[08:31:49] <ranum> Whereas if you don't drag/drop it, the image is responsive on the webpage
[08:33:55] <Cork> cleaned up example https://jsfiddle.net/nrcfexm2/1/
[08:34:19] <Cork> and fixed some additional html errors https://jsfiddle.net/nrcfexm2/2/
[08:35:02] <Cork> ranum: the image isn't scaling with the page without draggable so how does this depend on it exactly?
[08:36:16] <Cork> and just to prove that https://jsfiddle.net/nrcfexm2/3/
[08:41:28] <ranum> ok, it seems to be scaling now, but if you drag the image and drop it on the far right, the image is no longer visible on the webpage
[08:43:14] <ranum> is there a way to get the image to appear in a resized browser, even if it's dropped on the other side of the screen?
[08:56:53] <ranum> 1 - load page , 2 - (while browser window is maximized) use draggable to move image to right edge of screen 3 - resize browser window 4 - image is no longer visible on page. Is there some way to solve this display issue?
[12:00:42] <ranum> Anyone have any idea about the concern?
[14:20:42] <Buoy172> $(this) doesn't work with arrow functions. Can someone help me fix this: https://pastebin.com/fXPtL6gK
[14:21:36] <Buoy172> How do I select a child as a jQuery element, in the each() loop?
[14:21:39] <robertmaxrees> Buoy172 that's part of the point with arrows.
[14:22:03] <Buoy172> without witty remarks please, just give me a solution ;)
[14:22:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm not being witty >.>
[14:22:18] <robertmaxrees> if you check the docs at https://api.jquery.com/each/, you'll see that $.fn.each passes two args to the callback
[14:22:23] <robertmaxrees> index, element
[14:22:32] <Buoy172> oh!
[14:22:38] <Buoy172> really? Let me check...
[14:23:20] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/HC688J2.png
[14:23:40] <robertmaxrees> also: i wouldn't use .each() here.
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> use .map() instead.
[14:24:50] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/50660c9ae853
[14:26:06] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't have to run the jquery constructor a bunch of times.
[14:26:40] <Buoy172> robertmaxrees: thanks, and I think it should be "return $(element)"
[14:26:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:26:48] <robertmaxrees> just return element
[14:27:00] <robertmaxrees> the .map() returns a jquery object already :)
[14:27:40] <Buoy172> yeah but after it I put this for testing: alert(this.options[45].text()) and it didn't work
[14:27:53] <Buoy172> but with "return $(element);" it DID work
[14:27:57] <robertmaxrees> you want .eq()
[14:28:03] <robertmaxrees> you want a jquery object.
[14:28:08] <Buoy172> yes
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> not an array of jquery objects.
[14:28:25] <robertmaxrees> so this.options.eq(45).text()
[14:28:38] <Buoy172> oh, let me try that
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/Lks8uyur/
[14:29:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:30:32] <ranum> robertmaxrees: any idea to my question above?
[14:30:45] <Buoy172> Thanks, robertmaxrees. You're an expert :)
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> ranum wasn't here when you posted it ;)
[14:31:12] <robertmaxrees> Buoy172 hahaha nah, just a decent amount of experience.
[14:31:39] <ranum> <ranum> hello - Is there some way to solve this display issue? steps: 1 - load page , 2 - (while browser window is maximized) use draggable to move image to right edge of screen 3 - resize browser window 4 - image is no longer visible on page.
[14:31:55] <ranum> ex: https://jsfiddle.net/nrcfexm2/3/
[14:32:04] <robertmaxrees> ranum so you want to move the image when the window resizes?
[14:32:53] <ranum> Yes, I want the image to move as the browser resizes, and keep the image on the screen
[14:33:08] <robertmaxrees> hrmm
[14:34:56] <ranum> but the way it's working now, the image gets pushed out of the page when moved to the right edge, after resizing the browser.
[14:34:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'll want to bind a listener to the window resize event and then check if the image is in the viewport, then reposition it as necessary.
[14:36:16] <ranum> can you show me an example of that?
[14:36:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:36:29] <robertmaxrees> i can help guide you through the process :)
[14:36:45] <ranum> ok
[14:36:59] <robertmaxrees> so what about that doesn't make sense?
[14:39:16] <ranum> how do I know where to reposition to?
[14:39:54] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.
[14:40:30] <robertmaxrees> the easiest would be to grab the top/left position of the image and then check the left + img width
[14:41:29] <robertmaxrees> then compare that against the width of the viewport.  then subtract some number (say, half the image width) from that left position and set that as the new left
[14:41:33] <robertmaxrees> same thing with top/height
[14:42:16] <ranum> this would result in a responsive design?
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[14:42:39] <robertmaxrees> are you asking about responsive design?  or are you trying to fix an issue with the image?
[14:42:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:43:45] <ranum> both
[14:44:59] <robertmaxrees> responsive design is a completely different beast.
[14:47:44] <ranum> is there a way to implement draggable into responsive design?
[14:48:32] <ranum> I know the image will resize, but the same issue exists where it gets cut out of the browser window
[14:59:49] <robertmaxrees> just came back.
[15:00:31] <robertmaxrees> ranum for the image specifically you'll need to do what I suggested above.
[15:03:45] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:03:47] <ranum> gotcha. So it's possible to maintain a responsive design while having the flexibility of using draggable in this context?
[15:04:01] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:04:09] <robertmaxrees> you'll just have to handle the image different.y
[15:04:58] <ranum> I see. Would and other element which is dropped onto the web page be handled using the same logic?
[15:05:16] <robertmaxrees> how many draggables do you have?
[15:06:07] <robertmaxrees> fwiw another thing to consider in all of this is that people generally don't resize their windows down like that when interacting with a webpage
[15:07:17] <ranum> Good point. If I drag the element to the top right of a 13" screen, then load the screen on a 50" screen, will the element still be in the top right corner?
[15:07:39] <robertmaxrees> not if you aren't saving the positions
[15:08:37] <ranum> I can save the html of the page after the element is dragged
[15:09:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:09:04] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[15:09:41] <ranum> why not?
[15:10:13] <robertmaxrees> 2 big reasons stand out: 1) you'll be storing all of that markup and will have to figure out a strategy for syncing back to a server
[15:10:24] <robertmaxrees> 2) that's a nice way to enable xss attacks
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> *script injection, rather
[15:13:31] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nrcfexm2/4/
[15:14:33] <robertmaxrees> :) problem solved.
[15:16:21] <ranum> hmm nice
[15:16:31] <robertmaxrees> from https://stackoverflow.com/a/37329568/923919
[15:17:26] <ranum> but the image gets cut off at browser width of 600 px for some reason
[15:19:06] <robertmaxrees> you aren't using the w3schools css are you
[15:20:29] <ranum> I am
[15:20:47] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that :/
[15:20:55] <robertmaxrees> not really meant for reuse.
[15:21:01] <robertmaxrees> nor is their site very good
[15:22:58] <robertmaxrees> Anyway, I gotta get going.  Enjoy!
[15:25:50] <ranum> thanks
[16:22:41] <pavonia> Is there a way to get additional error information in the .ajax() error handler? The second argument is just "error", the third is empty
[16:23:04] <taplar> what exactly are you looking for?
[16:23:21] <taplar> the first argument is the xhr, which you should be able to grab the response code off of
[16:24:26] <pavonia> Let me try that ...
[16:28:21] <pavonia> taplar: What value should I look at? xhr.response is undefined
[16:28:32] <taplar> try status, or statusCode
[16:30:17] <pavonia> status is 0, statusCode seems to be a function
[16:33:28] <taplar> k, status of 0 is odd.
[16:33:34] <taplar> that almost makes me think the request did not happen
[16:38:07] <pavonia> The request is successful with 200 according to Firebug but no data seems to be transferred, though the ContentLength is > 0
[16:38:38] <taplar> what kind of response content is being returned?
[16:39:26] <pavonia> application/json
[16:39:42] <taplar> ok, and on the ajax request are you providing a dataType property?
[16:40:09] <pavonia> Hhm no
[16:40:36] <taplar> ok, and when you say application/json, is that what you are returning, or are you saying that's the Content-Type header value?
[16:40:55] <taplar> *on the response
[16:41:16] <pavonia> That's what the server sends as Content-Type
[16:41:51] <taplar> k.  so have you put a console.log as the first thing in the success method to see if it even goes in there?
[16:42:24] <taplar> because there are a couple possibilities here that are typical
[16:43:13] <taplar> it's often the case that people will have responses that return the Content-Type as application/json and then will try to parse the response in the success, but with that header it will already be parsed, and will be an error, which will cause the error() method to happen, iirc.
[16:43:24] <taplar> the other common case is that the response being returned is not valid json
[16:43:44] <pavonia> The success handler doesn't seem to be called
[16:44:07] <taplar> ok, so if you see the request in your network console and it does, indeed, return with a 200, that leans towards the second common case
[16:44:17] <taplar> invalid json returned
[16:44:31] <pavonia> Is there a way to output the plain data it receives from the server, without any parsing?
[16:44:59] <taplar> you could put dataType: 'text' on the ajax request options and that should make it not auto parse it, i believe
[16:45:38] <taplar> that should cause it to not try to parse it and the success method should get the response data as just a string
[16:49:09] <taplar> but you could also grab the response text out of the network console and stick it in some online json validator
[16:49:30] <taplar> or some IDEs have json validators if you identify the file as a json file
[16:51:16] <pavonia> dataType: "text" didn't work either. This is the ajax() call, perhaps it's something obvious: https://pastebin.com/raw/5vYiYFxP
[16:51:46] <pavonia> The strange thing is that there is no response content shown in the console
[16:52:13] <taplar> What is the response text in the network console for that request?
[16:55:05] <taplar> And what is the url of the page that you are running the script on?
[16:59:31] <pavonia> taplar: It doesn't show any response text, just says the length is 39B. The URL is that from the code above, it's a server running on localhost
[17:00:13] <taplar> so the page you are on is also on http://localhost:8001
[17:00:32] <pavonia> Yes
[17:00:46] <taplar> and the response code to the request in the network tab is 200
[17:00:58] <pavonia> Right
[17:01:20] <taplar> but if you click on the request in the network tab, and then on the right hand side click the response tab you don't see any text?
[17:01:42] <pavonia> Exactly :S
[17:02:05] <taplar> that would seem to suggest that you are not returning json
[17:02:30] <taplar> i mean, it's not returning anything at that point
[17:03:10] <taplar> If your response is setting the Content-Type to application/json it needs to always return json.  Even if the response is just {} or []
[17:04:19] <taplar> Or potentially return a 204, rather than a 200, to signify no content
[17:05:37] <taplar> So I would probably start by sticking http://localhost:8001/gettime/ into one of your browser tabs so you can see the response from it, and figure out what's up with your endpoint that it is not return json like it is expected to be
[17:08:34] <pavonia> If I'm calling that from the URL bar manually, the JSON is returned correctly
[17:09:12] <pavonia> It's just weird
[17:12:41] <taplar> well that doesn't make sense
[17:12:41] <taplar> If that is true, then you are most likely getting some CORS error, but you said you are calling it from the same protocol, server, and port
[17:12:41] <taplar> any error in your console?
[17:13:46] <taplar> try changing the url in your ajax to just 'gettime/'
[17:14:08] <taplar> or even without the ending slash
[17:17:33] <pavonia> So I restarted the server with debug infos enabled and now it magically works :|
[17:17:47] <taplar> without changing the url in the ajax?
[17:18:21] <pavonia> Yes. Still a parse error in the JSON, but at least it's a 200 response with text
[17:18:33] <taplar> heh, well cool.  small steps
[17:21:40] <pavonia> Ha, changing dataType from "application/json" to "json" fixed it
[17:22:02] <pavonia> taplar: Thanks for you help! No idea what the problem was, but it works now :)
[17:22:15] <taplar> well, if your response is setting the content type on it, you don't even need that
[17:22:44] <taplar> If you do not specify a datatype option, jQuery will look at the response Content-Type to try to figure out what to do
[17:23:05] <pavonia> Ah indeed
[17:23:12] <taplar> but for readability, and just to make sure, you might leave it in there
[17:23:45] <taplar> so, *shrug*, just your flavor of development
[18:43:36] <ranum> I'm having issues keeping draggable images responsive when using bootstrap
[18:44:45] <ranum> ie, image goes off the screen. how can this be solved?
