[01:08:25] <jop008> Goodmorning here. Can someone help with this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/110/ I got Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [value^=http://] jquery-1.9.1.js:442 when I attach a hyperlink
[01:11:58] <jop008> When I remove the jquery mobile js script code the problem is gone
[01:13:53] <ggdevelop> Hi, I hava a $(document).ready(function... and inside it a login function which return 1 or 0 if it seccuses to login, after that I hava consol.log to print the return value, which it undifine. it seems that the code continue running and not wait for the return value. Why is that? and how can I make it to wait the function to end and return it value?
[01:20:48] <ravenzz> ggdevelop ajax calls are asynchronous by default
[01:21:10] <ravenzz> so yes your script continues its execution
[01:21:16] <ravenzz> ?ajax101
[01:21:18] <b-ot> ravenzz: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpgÂ and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[01:21:27] <ravenzz> see this ^
[01:27:18] <jop008>  Can someone help with this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/110/ I got Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [value^=http://] jquery-1.9.1.js:442 when I attach a hyperlink
[01:32:30] <ggdevelop> ravenzz: so how can I make it synchronous?
[01:33:26] <ravenzz> ggdevelop you don't want to do so
[01:33:38] <ravenzz> because it will block the execution of your scripts
[01:34:09] <ravenzz> jop008 cos http:// should be quoted
[01:34:51] <ravenzz> you may want to fix the plugin (jqte)
[01:35:09] <ravenzz> file a bug or something
[01:36:16] <ggdevelop> ravenzz: why not I want to call: var isLogin=login() and only if isLogin value is 1 to cuntinue with my code. it must be synchronous.. as much as i know..
[01:37:04] <ravenzz> ggdevelop ideally you make the ajax request and on success you do something
[01:37:23] <ravenzz> you can define a callback function for the success status
[01:37:39] <ravenzz> as well as an error one
[01:38:25] <ggdevelop> is there any example for such a case?
[01:39:31] <ravenzz> yep see the documentation
[01:39:39] <ravenzz> ?ajax @ ggdevelop
[01:39:51] <peppo_pig> hi, how I can hide an option in a select list? I want to hide/show dinamically. must works with ie8 .... :(
[01:41:12] <ravenzz> how/when do you want to show/hide the option?
[01:42:37] <peppo_pig> I've 10 select box, with inside 22 oprion list, all are equals. If you coose eg option 1 from the first I must hide from the other
[01:42:56] <peppo_pig> If you change the selected option, I must show again in the other
[01:44:38] <peppo_pig> .hide /.show in ie8 doesn't work ....
[01:44:53] <jphase> it does hehe
[01:45:56] <jphase> oh sorry, just read that last part
[01:46:54] <jphase> peppo_pig: there's probably something else wrong with your code that IE8 doesn't like. Perhaps an extra , at the end of an array or object
[01:47:11] <quangle> ya
[01:47:17] <jphase> .show and .hide definitely work in any browser that should be legally on the internet
[01:47:18] <quangle> ie8 doesnt like ,
[01:47:46] <jphase> var poop = { something: 'here', another: 'thing', }     =    bad news bears in ie8
[01:48:33] <quangle> ya thats lame
[01:48:36] <peppo_pig> I found this solution, http://fiddle.jshell.net/FAkEK/100/
[01:48:54] <peppo_pig> but I'm not able to integrate with more than 1 select
[01:50:04] <jphase> peppo_pig: just .each through the selects
[01:54:22] <jphase> peppo_pig: put your html into a fiddle and I'll help you
[01:55:23] <peppo_pig> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/3VyLU/1/
[02:02:41] <giustoXricordarv> peppo_pig, nice nick

[03:36:38] <hmtabc> hello there
[03:36:44] <hmtabc> may i ask a question?
[03:37:16] <jphase> you just did :)
[03:37:31] <hmtabc> oh yes
[03:38:07] <hmtabc> what is the method of attributing for jquery ui
[03:38:08] <hmtabc> ?
[03:38:17] <hmtabc> i am just new to it
[03:38:32] <hmtabc> want 2 use it on my website
[03:38:46] <hmtabc> have downloaded the zip
[03:39:27] <hmtabc> can i directly use it and the source itself includes all attribution reqments?
[03:39:31] <jphase> just unzip the file and put the js in your js directory, the css in your css directory, and start using it after you include
[03:39:49] <jphase> you need jquery to run it, but I think that comes bundled as well
[03:40:04] <hmtabc> yeah i'm already using jquery
[03:40:19] <hmtabc> by cdn from google if i remember
[03:40:37] <jphase> hmtabc: http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/getting-started/
[03:42:48] <hmtabc> THanks jphase, but i only didn't find attribution info there. Does the source code itself contains sufficient and complete attribution for mit license, if u can tell plz.
[03:43:42] <jphase> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt
[03:44:59] <jphase> I'm honestly not entirely sure if that comes with the bundle
[03:45:07] <hmtabc> k
[03:45:22] <jphase> it's in their repo though so I'd look for it
[03:45:49] <jphase> yeah looks like it's just in the root of their repo
[03:46:46] <hmtabc> 1 more thing, is it wise to keep all folders js, css etc in one folder e.g. jqui, to keep the thing organized?
[03:48:57] <jphase> I typically drag the css into my css dir and then drag the UI theme folders in that folder along with it (so they're in their own folder but within my css folder)
[03:49:25] <jphase> and I put their js in my js folder, it's all up to you really
[03:52:58] <hmtabc> ok thanks jphase. THis was useful. :)
[03:53:07] <jphase> sure thing
[03:55:07] <hmtabc> Would like to ask if someone here knows abt attribution reqment for jquery ui, by their own experience,.......... i mean is it sufficient to directly use jquery ui after uploading the folders, or do we need to give a link to the jquery ui website on our webpage too?
[03:59:22] <hmtabc> how do u use it, i mean.
[04:00:03] <jphase> hmtabc: you don't have to link to the jquery ui site. you can use it for commercial and non-commercial use by just adding it to your site
[04:00:18] <hmtabc> oh thanks.
[04:00:29] <hmtabc> this is exactly i wanted to know
[04:01:17] <hmtabc> jphase, i would now start the work. Thanks.
[04:17:55] <wishypw> hi guys, can anyone advise me of a colorbox chatroom? perhaps on another irc server?
[04:18:12] <wishypw> (there doesn't seem to be on one freenode
[04:18:14] <wishypw> )
[04:20:49] <Crucials> whats a colorbox chatroom?
[04:22:36] <wishypw> the jquery plugin 'colorbox' by jack moore
[04:22:51] <wishypw> http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[04:25:12] <Crucials> what is the problem you're having?
[04:25:18] <Crucials> if someone knows, they'll answer :)
[04:32:43] <wishypw> y'know.. i just figured it out after a good few hours! :) thanks all the same
[04:33:33] <Boggie> http://jsfiddle.net/C7DBq/ - Hello folks, after several tries for working this out, i failed. I am trying to use the hidden text box that is shown only when the user clicks the hyperlink to set the label's text value, but I failed with all my attempts. Anything you see I might have overlooked or done wrong?
[04:33:38] <Boggie> Thanks in advance.
[04:36:44] <Crucials> Boggie: again, what is ment to happen? You want for 'The Label' to change to whatever you put in the input box?
[04:36:51] <Boggie> yes exactly :)
[04:38:34] <Crucials> $("lblChangeText").text(userInput); should probably be $("#lblChangeText").text(userInput);
[04:38:51] <Crucials> # for divs :)
[04:39:11] <Boggie> that was it, thanks! :)
[04:58:22] <Hilton> How can I get .animate() to return a color to it's previous property?
[05:18:33] <dekiss> what is this equal to this.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.className+=" open";
[05:18:36] <dekiss> in jquery
[05:20:07] <Crucials> are you going up 2 parents and adding a class?
[05:29:05] <Tomashe> im considering mapquest and leafetj, what do u think?
[05:48:17] <gdr7> hi
[05:48:22] <gdr7> Quick question about first-child
[05:48:36] <gdr7> I am using $('div:first-child').text('Change me');
[05:49:01] <gdr7> the first div I have has a series of child elements... like <div><strong>x</strong><p>y</p><strong>z</strong></div> for example
[05:49:14] <gdr7> using that jquery, I'd expect only the first strong to say "Change me"
[05:49:21] <gdr7> is that a correct assumption?
[05:49:32] <gdr7> because I am finding that the entire div is replaced and says "Change me"
[05:49:40] <gdr7> so I'm not seeing "y" or "z" displayed
[05:49:54] <gdr7> have I misunderstood how first-child works or am I doing something incorrectly?
[05:51:18] <jop008> Can someone try this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/110/ and make a hyperlink I got an error message using chrome Some say no error on the console I got Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [value^=http://] I can reward you if you find a solution!
[05:58:34] <dekiss> how can I cancel bootstrap click event on input element?
[06:12:12] <gdr7> guys, any ideas about the first-child question above?
[06:12:23] <gdr7> i'm sure its a simple answer
[06:20:06] <gdr7> guys?
[06:20:44] <sx_> because first-child return all first-childs
[06:22:39] <doug65536> gdr7: it's probably far more efficient to do $('div').children().first().text('Change me')
[06:23:01] <gdr7> doug65536: thank you
[06:23:04] <gdr7> I will do that
[06:23:11] <gdr7> for my own interest, why isn't div:first-child working?
[06:24:07] <doug65536> are you sure the first-child is selecting what you expect?
[06:25:26] <gdr7> no
[06:25:35] <gdr7> i thought it would only select "strong"
[06:25:40] <gdr7> but it seems to be seleting all of div
[06:25:49] <doug65536> gdr7: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/w7qHA/ works for me
[06:26:10] <jayayseakay>  guys just got a quick question, whats the best way to make one of those scrollers. Where you click something and it scrolls to a certain div?
[06:26:20] <doug65536> yes I see the behavior http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/w7qHA/1/
[06:26:57] <doug65536> gdr7: my suggestion works though http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/w7qHA/3/
[06:27:10] <gdr7> Try adding <p>Test</p>
[06:27:12] <gdr7> after your first p
[06:27:15] <gdr7> then running
[06:27:19] <gdr7> it replaces everything
[06:27:21] <gdr7> not just the first one
[06:27:23] <doug65536> I did, see my last fiddle
[06:27:34] <gdr7> http://jsfiddle.net/w7qHA/4/
[06:27:59] <gdr7> ah
[06:28:04] <gdr7> so what exactly is $('div:first-child').text('Changed!') doing?
[06:28:18] <gdr7> my understanding is it would select the first div it finds, and select the first child of that div
[06:28:23] <gdr7> clearly it's not doing that
[06:28:27] <gdr7> it just seems to be selecting the whole div
[06:28:58] <Crucials> I think it would be selecting the first child that is also a div?
[06:29:18] <doug65536> gdr7: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/w7qHA/5/
[06:29:38] <doug65536> first child selects the first child of its parent! https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/:first-child
[06:29:50] <sx_> yeah..http://jsfiddle.net/w7qHA/6/
[06:30:13] <gdr7> doug65536L yeah I read that doco
[06:30:21] <gdr7> intuitively it isn't doing that though
[06:30:29] <sx_> $("div:first-child") just return itself.....
[06:30:32] <gdr7> unless I am misunderstanding what 'div:first-child' is doing
[06:30:33] <doug65536> gdr7: did you run the fiddle I made that does what you want
[06:30:39] <Crucials> basically gdr7 - it just finds the first div
[06:30:50] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/w7qHA/5/
[06:30:53] <gdr7> doug65536 - yes, thank you
[06:30:54] <Crucials> not the first child
[06:31:03] <gdr7> I am just curious, so I can learn, why what I was doing doesn't work
[06:31:41] <gdr7> Crucials: so what is the point of first-child?
[06:31:44] <Crucials> :whatever is a pseudo class that helps you filter what it is you're selecting. It doesnt actually travel down heirarchy i don't think
[06:31:45] <dekiss> how can I cancel remove handler with jqeury
[06:31:48] <doug65536> gdr7: my honest answer: because pseudo selectors are strange and unintuitive
[06:31:49] <gdr7> wouldn't div.eq(0) do the same?
[06:31:50] <sx_> it seems clear...:)
[06:32:04] <Crucials> yes, i think it would
[06:32:04] <gdr7> sx_: $("div:first-child") just return itself.....
[06:32:22] <gdr7> sx_ by looking at the code how do you come to that conclusion?
[06:32:22] <doug65536> gdr7: of course it does... it returns the first child OF ITS PARENT
[06:32:52] <gdr7> if you have <div><strong>test1</strong><p>test2</p></strong> - isn't test 1 the first child of the parent (div) ?
[06:33:20] <gdr7> I thought the code 'div:first-child' is saying find me the first div, and find the first child of that div
[06:33:24] <Crucials> gdr7: http://jsfiddle.net/w7qHA/7/
[06:33:26] <doug65536> gdr7: not in the cracked out minds of the CSS standards committee it isn't
[06:33:54] <sx_> http://jsfiddle.net/w7qHA/8/
[06:34:04] <Crucials> remove the :first-child and they would both be changed
[06:34:36] <gdr7> Crucials: so no difference between first and first-child?
[06:34:45] <gdr7> It is very unintuitive
[06:35:05] <Crucials> I dont know if there is any difference really
[06:35:10] <gdr7> $('div p:first-child').text('Changed!') makes more sense
[06:35:16] <doug65536> gdr7: forget what you think it should mean. read the doc on what it does mean and get on with your day
[06:35:27] <doug65536> :)
[06:35:40] <dekiss> http://pastie.org/8647930
[06:35:44] <dekiss> please check this
[06:36:07] <dekiss> how can I cancel all those event handlers?
[06:36:18] <dekiss> its 3 liens code
[06:36:34] <doug65536> dekiss: this.toggle doesn't make sense. remove "this."
[06:37:09] <doug65536> dekiss: actually, that doesn't make sense either...
[06:37:23] <doug65536> dekiss: is toggle a function or is it '[data-toggle=dropdown]'
[06:37:29] <doug65536> I think you have two "toggle"'s
[06:38:15] <dekiss> no idea
[06:38:22] <dekiss> how can I cancel every event handler?
[06:38:43] <gdr7> Ah!
[06:38:44] <doug65536> dekiss: bad idea, but you can with element.off()
[06:38:50] <gdr7> div :first-child works as expected
[06:38:52] <gdr7> with a space
[06:38:55] <dekiss> where should I add that
[06:38:59] <gdr7> without a space, doesnt' work as expected
[06:39:03] <gdr7> so I just needed a space :)
[06:39:04] <Crucials> gdr7: good to know
[06:39:05] <gdr7> thanks everyone
[06:39:41] <dekiss> doug65536 ?
[06:39:48] <dekiss> I added that doesn't work
[06:40:09] <doug65536> dekiss: in your code, it would be $(element).off()
[06:40:35] <doug65536> to just remove that click handler, you can do $(element).off('click.dropdown.data-api').on(...
[06:40:45] <doug65536> to recreate the handler without duplicating
[06:41:06] <doug65536> .off() removes everything
[06:41:16] <doug65536> .off('foo') removes the foo handler
[06:41:47] <dekiss> I did that wont help
[06:42:30] <doug65536> dekiss: then why did you ask
[06:43:37] <dekiss> doug65536 pla man can you do example pls
[06:44:30] <doug65536> dekiss: of removing handlers?
[06:44:54] <dekiss> doug65536 please do example
[06:44:59] <dekiss> I am not sure what I need to do :S
[06:45:05] <dekiss> I am confused
[06:45:55] <dekiss> doug65536 I need to remove all event handlers -_-
[06:46:47] <cuqa> hey, can someone tell me why the following doe snot work
[06:47:29] <cuqa> http://pastebin.com/rTn7kvgx
[06:48:03] <malusalexandru> Hi guys! I have a problem implementing a Jquery alternative to an observe_field in Rails 3. gist: https://gist.github.com/maimutza/cfb3bda8d4a246d16eed
[06:48:56] <cuqa> it does not toggle the class, however the checkbox input field is correctly selected/deselected
[06:49:47] <doug65536> dekiss: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/B5WN7/
[06:50:56] <doug65536> dekiss: you don't need to remove all event handlers. you are asking an XY question
[06:51:25] <doug65536> dekiss: you think if you could remove all event handlers your problems would be solved, but removing all event handlers is almost always a bad idea
[06:51:31] <doug65536> what are you really trying to solve
[06:52:19] <stev3> hey is it possible to unselect a selected radio button?
[06:52:33] <dekiss> doug65536 please tell me how toremove event handlers
[06:52:41] <dekiss> from here why they are not removing :S
[06:53:03] <doug65536> dekiss: I did tell you how to remove event handlers, and I wrote an example that removes and reattaches handlers
[06:53:48] <dekiss> ok this
[06:53:50] <dekiss> bootstrap
[06:54:03] <dekiss> when you click checkbox inside drop down menu it closes the dro pdown menu
[06:54:06] <dekiss> want to prevent that
[06:54:44] <doug65536> dekiss: then in your checkbox click event handler, call event.stopPropagation() and make that event handler take a parameter called event
[06:55:05] <dekiss> doug65536 I don't want to edit bootstrap files
[06:55:13] <gdr7> one final question
[06:55:15] <dekiss> so Ican update them later without rewriting the fix
[06:55:24] <doug65536> dekiss: did I say edit bootstrap files?
[06:55:27] <gdr7> div :first-child (with the space), will hit the first child of every div it finds
[06:55:36] <gdr7> how do I just hit the first child of the FIRST div it finds?
[06:55:42] <dekiss> can you pls write it down :S
[06:55:43] <dekiss> doug65536
[06:55:56] <doug65536> gdr7: div:first :first-child maybe
[06:56:29] <gdr7> yeah I tried that
[06:56:31] <gdr7> no luck
[06:56:34] <stev3> http://jsfiddle.net/J6cF6/ halp
[06:56:35] <gdr7> first one I tried :)
[06:57:26] <doug65536> dekiss: how about you write it down in jsfiddle and I'll try to fix it
[06:57:35] <Woet> stev3: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics
[06:58:06] <dekiss> oh man
[06:58:07] <stev3> Woet, that's unhelpful
[06:58:09] <dekiss> mercy
[06:58:22] <Woet> stev3: it's not, please read it so you can see what is wrong with your code
[06:58:36] <Woet> also, you didn't select jquery on the left of jsfiddle
[06:58:46] <Woet> so even if your code was proper it wouldn't work
[06:58:49] <doug65536> gdr7: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Jfw59/
[06:58:59] <dekiss> doug65536 cab you please explain this to me ?  $('html').on('click.dropdown.data-api', function () {
[06:59:15] <Woet> stev3: hint, look at your console and read the jquery basics docs.
[06:59:16] <stev3> Woet, even if i did all of that, it wouldnt work
[06:59:30] <Woet> stev3: doing all of what?
[06:59:33] <doug65536> dekiss: it sets up an event handler that will handle any click.dropdown.data-api event on the whole page
[07:00:16] <stev3> Woet, all this http://jsfiddle.net/rG4Bh/
[07:00:32] <Woet> stev3: that works.
[07:00:51] <stev3> i'm obviously not getting the desired effect lol
[07:01:37] <gdr7> doug... hmm, i betetr have another go then!
[07:01:58] <cuqa> hey, can someone tell me why the following doe snot work
[07:02:01] <cuqa> http://pastebin.com/rTn7kvgx
[07:02:03] <cuqa> it does not toggle the class, however the checkbox input field is correctly selected/deselected
[07:02:33] <dekiss> I use javascript
[07:02:43] <dekiss> then I have hard time learning jquery libraries
[07:03:08] <dekiss> what is click.dropdown.data-api  event?
[07:03:15] <dekiss> doug65536 ^
[07:03:35] <gdr7> doug... silly me
[07:03:37] <gdr7> syntax error
[07:03:42] <gdr7> was doing div.first, not div:first
[07:03:52] <gdr7> right you are, it works :)
[07:04:09] <doug65536> dekiss: it's an event from some plugin. you can make an event called 'my.grandmother' and you could handle it with .on('my.grandmother') if you wanted to
[07:04:48] <Crucials> cuqa: could you quickly recreate it on jsfiddle.com ?
[07:05:14] <doug65536> dekiss: a quick google search told me it is bootstrap-dropdown's event
[07:05:32] <dekiss> doug65536 I don't understand
[07:05:37] <dekiss> when will this event happen?
[07:07:09] <doug65536> dekiss: what version of bootstrap?
[07:07:25] <stev3> http://jsfiddle.net/xeFUA/ <-- how can i get this to work without the alert?
[07:07:29] <dekiss> not sure
[07:07:43] <dekiss>  v2.3.2
[07:07:47] <dekiss> doug65536 ^
[07:08:07] <doug65536> dekiss: that event will happen when the user clicks a dropdown (obviously)
[07:09:24] <doug65536> dekiss: bootstrap documentation sucks but here's the dropdown doc http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#dropdowns
[07:09:42] <krastavac> do you know some facebook like jquery scrollbar?
[07:10:24] <Crucials> cuqa: you still here?
[07:11:02] <doug65536> cuqa: it should work. are you sure you don't have a css bug? the dimmed class will get added to the tr
[07:11:17] <doug65536> toggled on*
[07:11:58] <doug65536> cuqa: i.e. did you manually test adding/removing a dimmed class on a tr in the html to check
[07:13:40] <doug65536> stev3: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/xeFUA/2/
[07:13:48] <cuqa> Crucials: http://jsfiddle.net/3UY25/
[07:13:56] <doug65536> stev3: lol?
[07:14:12] <cuqa> there is always either one thing working :[
[07:14:21] <Woet> stev3: did you try saying what the desired effect is?
[07:14:33] <Woet> just showing code and saying "it's not the desired effect" doesn't really help
[07:15:30] <Crucials> cuqa: basically as far as I understand, when you call ".trigger('click')" it clicks #learn tr AGAIN, therefore toggling it off
[07:15:36] <Crucials> so it toggles on and off instantly
[07:16:10] <Crucials> what is it you're trying to achieve exactly?
[07:17:17] <cuqa> toggle the checkbox and if checkbox is unchecked then change opacity to 0.5
[07:17:24] <Crucials> cuqa: what actually happens when you click: http://i.imgur.com/LwJviD9.gif
[07:17:26] <cuqa> if checkbox is checked, then opacity should be 1
[07:17:42] <Crucials> slow motion P
[07:18:17] <cuqa> maybe there is a better way than .trigger('click') do achieve the toggle of the checkbox
[07:18:54] <Crucials> try .attr("selected", "selected");
[07:19:10] <doug65536> .prop('checked', true)
[07:19:25] <Crucials> that sounds better
[07:20:47] <Crucials> but you would have to also set it false when its unchecked
[07:21:16] <doug65536> cuqa: wait a minute, "checkbox"? it's a radio button
[07:22:04] <cuqa> it's a checkbox?
[07:22:18] <stev3> doug65536, Woet ... obviously it's to be able to uncheck the radio button?
[07:22:26] <Woet> it unchecks the radio button.
[07:22:35] <stev3> lol
[07:22:40] <stev3> are you being serious or?
[07:22:54] <Woet> can you please stop being so vague?
[07:22:57] <Woet> your code literally says
[07:22:58] <doug65536> sure you can "uncheck" a radio button, but it's borderline nonsense
[07:23:01] <Woet> when this gets checked, uncheck it
[07:23:08] <Woet> it does exactly that
[07:23:09] <doug65536> a radio button has one thing selected, that's the whole point
[07:23:14] <Woet> so what DO you want it to do?
[07:23:25] <cuqa> i do not have radio buttons
[07:23:25] <decx> i aint seeing no radiobutton, what are you people talking about
[07:23:29] <stev3> well, doug65536 it doesn't have to be posted, so...
[07:23:37] <stev3> not really?
[07:23:48] <Woet> so again, stev3, what are you trying to do?
[07:23:52] <doug65536> if it's a checkbox, use type="checkbox" and stop abusing type="radio" with hacks?
[07:23:52] <stev3> Woet, i want to be able to check the radio button.. and then... uncheck it
[07:23:57] <Woet> IT DOES THAT.
[07:24:03] <Woet> holy shit
[07:24:07] <stev3> LOL
[07:24:15] <stev3> Woet, do you have autism? or are you trolling
[07:24:23] <stev3> i want it to act like a radio button in every other way doug65536
[07:24:27] <Woet> i don't have either
[07:24:32] <Woet> state what the fuck you are trying ot do
[07:24:35] <Woet> i've asked it 7 times
[07:24:39] <Woet> don't describe it technically
[07:24:42] <decx> oh i got the wrong conversation/fiddle combo
[07:24:44] <stev3> doug65536 got it after the first lol
[07:24:46] <Woet> provide context
[07:24:56] <Crucials> there are two conversations happening about checkboxes and radio buttons
[07:25:00] <Crucials> as far as i gather
[07:25:00] <stev3> Woet, i want to be able to check the radio button.. and then... uncheck it
[07:25:01] <decx> :_D
[07:25:04] <stev3> at the moment, it doesnt check
[07:25:13] <Woet> what the fuck
[07:25:21] <Woet> you are trying to turn a radio button into a checkbox?
[07:25:23] <Woet> why.. on earth
[07:25:24] <stev3> http://jsfiddle.net/4gk8x/
[07:25:29] <stev3> oh now you get it
[07:25:42] <Woet> yea, i'm very bad at understanding retarded ideas
[07:25:43] <Woet> sorry about that
[07:25:52] <Woet> if you want a checkbox, use a checkbox
[07:25:52] <stev3> you cant even understand a retard idea?
[07:26:00] <Woet> [16:23:52]  <doug65536>	 if it's a checkbox, use type="checkbox" and stop abusing type="radio" with hacks?
[07:26:16] <stev3> im pretty sure you can check two checkboxes at once though?
[07:26:33] <doug65536> so you want to make it have nothing selected if you click the selected radio button, and otherwise act like a radio button, right?
[07:26:48] <Woet> if you want multiple things to be selected, use checkbox
[07:26:53] <Woet> if you only want one option to be selected, use radio
[07:27:01] <Woet> not sure how this can possibly be unclear
[07:27:02] <stev3> ye. thats why im using a radio button lol
[07:27:13] <Woet> so why are you trying to make it behave as a checkbox..?
[07:27:16] <stev3> Woet, you're being really obtuse and aggressive
[07:27:20] <stev3> i'd rather you didn't talk to me
[07:27:27] <Woet> then /ignore me
[07:27:30] <stev3> calling me a retard when you're the one haivng trouble LOL
[07:27:34] <stev3> it's ridiculous
[07:27:53] <Woet> i've asked you to provide context about 10 times now
[07:28:03] <Woet> show the UI you're trying to achieve
[07:28:10] <Woet> so we can tell you how to properly do it
[07:28:14] <Woet> instead of these horrendous hacks
[07:28:25] <stev3> i want all the functionality of a radio button
[07:28:36] <stev3> but i also want to uncheck it
[07:28:46] <stev3> that's literally it
[07:29:21] <doug65536> stev3: so what about keyboard interface then, that will require more hackery
[07:29:48] <doug65536> stev3: I can hack it to work like you want for mouse though
[07:30:16] <stev3> that would be fantasic, though i didnt expect so much hackery to be involved
[07:30:35] <doug65536> stev3: you're defeating the intended usage of radio button
[07:30:55] <stev3> i'm not sure i am, doug65536 ?
[07:31:01] <stev3> can a radio button not be left unused?
[07:31:20] <doug65536> in the 1970's radios really had buttons like that to preset radio stations with a mechanical mechanism
[07:31:43] <doug65536> you can only be on one station at a time right? that's where it got its name
[07:31:52] <doug65536> you can't be on "no radio station"
[07:31:57] <stev3> can a radio button not be left unused?
[07:32:42] <stev3> perhaps i can have an extra button and have people select that to mean no selection..
[07:33:04] <Woet> yes, that's how radio buttons have worked since the day they were invented
[07:33:25] <doug65536> stev3: do that or, use checkboxes and in the click handler, uncheck all the "other" options. that way it will work fine even for odd browsers or disabled people without a mouse, etc
[07:34:15] <Crucials> cuqa: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/3UY25/1/
[07:35:25] <Crucials> cuqa: actually, this http://jsfiddle.net/3UY25/2/
[07:36:19] <Woet> stev3: http://jsfiddle.net/hKj8Z/
[07:36:20] <Woet> if you insist.
[07:36:45] <stev3> i actually just figured it out for radio buttons <3
[07:36:47] <Woet> but usually you have <input type="radio"> None <input type="radio"> 10 <input type="radio"> 20
[07:36:53] <Woet> which has been that way for years
[07:37:04] <stev3> okay
[07:37:10] <stev3> that's unsightly though :(
[07:37:27] <cuqa> Crucials: that does not work
[07:37:31] <cuqa> but I found a fix now
[07:37:42] <cuqa> trigger('click') was indeed the problem
[07:37:57] <cuqa> $(this).find('input[type=checkbox]').prop('checked', $(this).find('input[type=checkbox]').attr('checked') == 'checked' ? false : true);
[07:38:08] <doug65536> removeAttr is not ideal. .prop('checked', false) is drastically more efficient and straightforward
[07:38:34] <stev3> http://jsfiddle.net/VnZLZ/
[07:38:52] <Woet> stev3: doesn't work with keyboards
[07:39:03] <Woet> and it completely defeats the purpose
[07:39:06] <stev3> i doubt anyone will be using their keyboard on my form
[07:39:24] <Woet> because fuck usability right
[07:39:27] <doug65536> stev3: to hell with disabled people?
[07:39:29] <Woet> fuck blind people
[07:39:32] <stev3> ROFl
[07:39:34] <stev3> autism
[07:39:35] <stev3> everywhere
[07:39:41] <stev3> ass burgers
[07:39:43] <Crucials> cuqa: mine didn't work?
[07:39:47] <Woet> TIL people who care about usability have autism
[07:40:02] <Woet> poor stev3 and his twisted views
[07:40:04] <stev3> yes
[07:40:09] <stev3> i hate blind people
[07:40:12] <stev3> all the cripples in fact
[07:40:17] <doug65536> I think it's more autistic to FORCE a radio button to not be a radio button
[07:40:32] <Woet> doug65536: true, true
[07:40:33] <stev3> i will demonstrate my hate for them via these radio buttons
[07:40:45] <stev3> that will show them they are not welcome
[07:40:50] <cuqa> Crucials: no, didnt work  for me
[07:41:08] <Crucials> works for me, was it not what you intended?
[07:41:36] <Crucials> if its toggled, it becomes dimmed, and if untoggled, it undims?
[07:44:29] <cuqa> maybe u posted the wrong link, it doenst work at all for me
[07:44:51] <Crucials> http://jsfiddle.net/3UY25/3/
[07:46:15] <cuqa> doesnt work for me .. but whatever now :/
[07:46:23] <Crucials> odd
[07:46:25] <decx> btw you should always either connect your inputs to a label with label for, or wrap the input&text inside a label
[07:46:28] <cuqa> using firefox
[07:46:50] <cuqa> or no, it was opened with chromium
[07:47:19] <cuqa> works with firefox ;)
[07:47:31] <Crucials> works with chrome for me :P
[07:48:21] <Crucials> the way you were doing it was a bit strange because you were looking for clicks on the <td>
[07:48:35] <cuqa> tr
[07:48:36] <Crucials> and then you would get double clicks if someone clicks the actual checkbox
[07:48:40] <Crucials> <tr>, yeah
[07:48:46] <cuqa> yea, usually the checkbox is hidden
[07:49:08] <cuqa> so this did not really matter
[07:49:15] <Crucials> i see
[07:50:13] <decx> use input type="hidden" for hidden inputs
[07:52:36] <decx> then again, with a hidden checkbox you can have a no-js fallback
[08:59:32] <krastavac> do you know some jquery scrollbar i could use with bootstrap?
[09:27:43] <ekkis> morning everyone.  I'm struggling with $.validate() in that my function returns a false and that should prevent form submission but it does not? could anyone help? maybe I don't have this structured properly
[10:14:29] <alleZSoyez> hi everyone... anyone else having issues with :button selector?
[10:15:07] * ekkis didn't realise there was such a selector
[10:16:50] <Technical_13> Can anyone assist me with http://jsfiddle.net/ShoeMaker/DZaE2/ which is suppose to add up all of the values in daily_views and return that sum and the rank on page http://stats.grok.se/json/en/latest30/foo
[10:18:16] <Technical_13> That is the root component of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Technical_13/SandBox/getPageViews.js That I'm working on which will loop through and get multiple results for multiple pages.
[10:33:06] <shoky> Technical_13: getting a cross-domain error. you can't ajax to a different origin unless the server explicitly supports it
[10:33:41] <Technical_13> So how do I retrieve that information?
[10:34:01] <Technical_13> I don't have the URL directly to the api.
[10:34:11] <Technical_13> or I could try jsonp
[10:34:16] <Technical_13> or &callback=
[10:34:19] <Technical_13> or something..
[10:34:42] <shoky> Technical_13 if the server doesn't support it, you can't. only using a server-side proxy
[10:34:48] <Technical_13> http://stats.grok.se/jsonp/en/latest30/foo seems to work...
[10:34:55] <shoky> and this server doesn't seem to support CORS or JSONP
[10:35:01] <shoky> yes, it works, but not through ajax
[10:35:25] <shoky> oh
[10:35:32] <shoky> yeah then you can use that jsonp url
[10:35:50] <shoky> hang on
[10:37:20] <shoky> Technical_13: http://jsfiddle.net/DZaE2/1/
[10:37:59] <Technical_13> perfect... I'll add that to my script and see how it works.. :)
[10:39:58] <DobreJoe> Hi. I'm trying to execute several setTimeout functions in a loop but I get the following error: Don't make functions within a loop. How could I get the repetitions happen?
[10:40:09] <DobreJoe> Here's my weave: http://liveweave.com/PZXWxG
[10:40:18] <grafi> weave
[10:42:01] <grafi> DobreJoe that seems to be more of a courtesy warning from the editor code works just fine
[10:42:28] <shoky> doing setTimeouts in a loop is a bad idea though, it's not doing anything
[10:42:43] <shoky> that is, each iteration is setting identical timeouts
[10:42:56] <shoky> the loop finishes immediately
[10:43:21] <grafi> setting shoky in a timeout
[10:43:22] <grafi> :P
[10:43:40] <shoky> that too ;p
[10:43:42] <DobreJoe> how could I make some setTimeout repetitions?
[10:44:06] <shoky> put the whole thing in a function, and call the function from the setTimeout callback
[10:44:19] <shoky> recursively, sort of
[10:44:35] <DobreJoe> I see... will tryi
[10:45:36] <krastavac> on facebook and twitter that last one scrollbar is also default, it is impossible to be overriden??
[10:49:14] <Technical_13> shoky: That is so wierd... the fiddle works, but when I copy the paste into the console on https://en.wikipedia.org it says it is attempting to get the infor in the console, but then does nothing..
[10:50:29] <Technical_13> What could be causing that?
[10:50:35] <shoky> Technical_13: [blocked] The page at 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page' was loaded over HTTPS, but ran insecure content from 'http://stats.grok.se/jsonp/en/latest30/foo?callback=pageviewsCallback&_=1390157411887': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.

[11:02:12] <paulvd> i have a div which changes height and width, what is the best way to run a script only when it resizes
[11:04:08] <grafi> how does it resize?
[11:04:30] <paulvd> its a slider
[11:04:32] <paulvd> http://francecom.staging.wpengine.com/
[11:04:52] <paulvd> i have successfully added classes to the active, next and prev slides
[11:05:00] <paulvd> just want to change them when it slides
[11:06:17] <grafi> so hook into the slider?
[11:06:24] <paulvd> i have tried .resize
[11:06:30] <paulvd> attrchange plugin and mutate plugin
[11:06:33] <paulvd> but none of them seem to work
[11:07:54] <paulvd> what hook into the slider
[11:08:46] <grafi> the slider plugin should know when it slides and what slide is the active one
[11:08:52] <grafi> or not?
[11:10:15] <paulvd> unfortuantely it does not
[11:10:24] <paulvd> or else i wouldnt have been doing it
[11:10:40] <paulvd> this is the only carousel i found which accepts html
[11:11:36] <royalty> paulvd, um I'm pretty sure you can put html in any carousel that simply slides through a list
[11:11:37] <royalty> in the li
[11:11:50] <paulvd> the way its there now?
[11:11:55] <paulvd> did you see that carousel
[11:12:15] <royalty> yeah
[11:12:21] <royalty> can't you just put those elements
[11:12:23] <royalty> into the li
[11:12:36] <paulvd> i tried 2-3
[11:12:38] <royalty> <li> <div class="shadow">
[11:12:41] <royalty> etc etc
[11:12:48] <paulvd> they were ignoring the html inside the li
[11:12:54] <paulvd> weird though
[11:13:01] <royalty> you sure it wasn't just styling issues?
[11:13:06] <paulvd> yes
[11:13:11] <paulvd> infact
[11:13:11] <royalty> weird
[11:13:36] <royalty> thing is where is the actual main image
[11:13:40] <paulvd> yes thats why i had to settle down to this one
[11:13:41] <royalty> all I see here in this website
[11:13:43] <royalty> is the carousel
[11:13:58] <paulvd> actual main image?
[11:14:06] <royalty> yeah so
[11:14:09] <royalty> the slider is just ummm
[11:14:24] <royalty> composed of those postcard looking things?
[11:14:32] <royalty> with the titles tours in northeast france?
[11:14:36] <paulvd> yes
[11:14:40] <royalty> oh man
[11:14:43] <royalty> lol
[11:14:46] <royalty> use bxSlider
[11:14:47] <paulvd> slider/carousel/whatever
[11:14:57] <paulvd> bxslider can do this ?
[11:15:01] <royalty> yeah
[11:15:05] <royalty> you can throw html in the lis
[11:15:14] <royalty> it is even responsive if you want it to be
[11:15:18] <royalty> but you probably don't
[11:15:37] <royalty> paulvd: http://bxslider.com/ have fun
[11:15:58] <paulvd> i have used bx slider
[11:16:02] <paulvd> before
[11:16:02] <royalty> oh
[11:16:06] <royalty> and?
[11:16:09] <paulvd> but not on this one
[11:16:13] <paulvd> but bxslider is a simple slider
[11:16:18] <paulvd> this one is not a simple one
[11:16:28] <royalty> I mean... what is not simple about it?
[11:16:52] <paulvd> the fact that the rest of the slides are beneath others?
[11:16:58] <royalty> oh true
[11:17:05] <royalty> ahhhh
[11:17:07] <paulvd> bxslider cant do this
[11:17:13] <royalty> haha I see sorry I feel a bit bad now
[11:17:16] <royalty> totally missed that
[11:17:48] <paulvd> np
[11:17:56] <paulvd> i have achieved half 70% though
[11:17:57] <grafi> paulvd what slider do you use then? any links?`
[11:18:12] <paulvd> just not getting how to grab resize part
[11:18:30] <paulvd> this one
[11:18:30] <paulvd> http://www.responsivejqueryslider.com/carousel_responsive.html
[11:18:36] <grafi> if it doesnt support any kind of events its probably easy enough to hack it so it works for you
[11:18:39] <royalty> paulvd: there is also flexslider http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[11:18:44] <royalty> I think it would do what you need
[11:19:01] <grafi> i mean you basically just need to know when the slides change, yes?
[11:20:06] <paulvd> yes
[11:20:15] <paulvd> so i thought i would do a check on the active slide
[11:20:23] <paulvd> when it changes height or width
[11:20:39] <royalty> paulvd: here is a better page for it http://flexslider.woothemes.com/basic-carousel.html
[11:20:39] <paulvd> so i tried this http://meetselva.github.io/attrchange/
[11:20:51] <royalty> but yeah check it out if all else fails
[11:20:52] <royalty> lol
[11:21:25] <paulvd> royalty: flexslider does not give you the layout i want
[11:21:40] <royalty> pualvd: oh ok
[11:23:22] <paulvd> i used this code to set the classes
[11:23:22] <paulvd> http://pastebin.com/GLJbXN8G
[11:31:56] <royalty> paulvd: you know that next button
[11:32:02] <royalty> paulvd: on the slider
[11:32:19] <royalty> paulvd: why can't you just move the classes forward an element when you click it?
[11:32:26] <royalty> paulvd: oh nevermind
[11:32:37] <royalty> paulvd: I forgot that it has to be automatic as ell
[11:32:38] <royalty> well
[11:32:41] <paulvd> no
[11:32:46] <paulvd> dont need automatic
[11:32:49] <paulvd> can disable that
[11:33:04] <royalty> oh then you can just do that if you want
[11:33:09] <paulvd> when i put autoplay: 0 or false, it still slides
[11:33:51] <royalty> that sucks man
[11:34:05] <royalty> it's hard to help when you use a proprietary slider lol
[11:37:38] <paulvd> i know
[11:37:55] <paulvd> i have no other option now
[11:40:44] <royalty> paulvd: maybe try asking for support from them
[11:41:04] <royalty> you paid for their product so it is the least they could do
[11:49:35] <kpl> To prevent the normal postback of a <form> and instead make an ajax call to a server, is the principle to $(formelement).bind('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault();   ajax_server_code_here; }  ??
[11:50:40] <royalty> kpl: I have another solution lol
[11:51:12] <royalty> kpl: but yeah that sounds about right... but you are missing the people who have JS disabled
[11:51:18] <royalty> kpl: not a big deal imo
[11:52:59] <kpl> For 2.0.3 should I use "on" instead of "bind"?
[11:53:21] <royalty> kpl: I forgot exactly what to use but I think you are safe using .submit(
[11:55:16] <kpl> From docs I get the impression that "bind" still works in jQ>=1.7, but unlike "on" binds directly without delegation
[11:56:38] <kpl> While "submit" actually  is a shortcut for .on( "submit"
[11:57:33] <royalty> I'm kind of a newb, what does without delegation mean?
[12:00:00] <kpl> That the element must exist when the jQ "bind" is called, and binding is done directly on the element.
[12:00:19] <royalty> oh
[12:00:36] <royalty> well if you prefer that then use .bind
[12:00:43] <royalty> lol
[12:00:57] <royalty> I feel bad for saying that actually now that I said that but thanks for enlightening me
[12:02:40] <royalty> I've actually written a pure javaScript function that handles form submission and adding an ajaxFunction instead of the submit function in
[12:02:59] <royalty> it also handles front end validation
[12:03:34] <royalty> kpl, if you were the first besides me to try it out, I would be honored, hahaha
[12:04:03] <royalty> it's working and it has documentation
[12:06:29] <gumble> does javascript not wait for my $.post request to be finished but just run ahead in the meantime???
[12:06:50] <royalty> gumble, your post request is running in the background if that makes sense
[12:06:57] <gumble> dam n
[12:07:03] <royalty> $.post is designed by default to be asynchronous
[12:07:14] <gumble> what if I need my function to return a value that I get as an answer in a post request?
[12:07:28] <gumble> is it enough when I put the return in the success handler?
[12:07:29] <Crucials> you can call a function when its done
[12:07:37] <gumble> or is the function long finished then?
[12:08:09] <royalty> umm you can grab the result of your post request and throw it somewhere on the page
[12:08:52] <gumble> I am modifiying a plugin of someone else I want to just fit into his code you know what I mean? I mean I have a piece of code like ..... product_price = my_ajax_calculator(); .... and I want my_ajax_calculator to return the new price so that the other plugin calculates with it
[12:08:57] <gumble> is that no way possible?
[12:09:33] <royalty> gumble: that sounds possible...
[12:09:53] <gumble> royalty: can you tell me how? I don't get it atm, maybe I am just to tired
[12:10:26] <gumble> if the my_ajax_calculator does not wait for the ajax to finish and returns something else or nothing in the meantime, it doesn't work or not?
[12:10:51] <royalty> gumble: okay so basically his ajax request is grabbing that price, right? so you just find where his success function is and do what you want with it?
[12:11:27] <royalty> gumble: you could run your plug in right after his calculator calculates what it needs to
[12:12:23] <royalty> gumble: it will probably get messy but yeah I think you can do it
[12:12:33] <royalty> gumble: not entirely sure what you are trying to do though
[12:14:13] <gumble> royalty: no he calculates the price with a javasxcript function and does some modification like: .... product_price = calculate price() .... convert_units(product_price); display(product_price)... he basically does a lot of stuff with the product price after he calculated it. exactly the same has to be done with mine. so it would be perfect if I could just somehow put my product_price = my_ajax_calculator(); somewhere directly after
[12:14:13] <gumble> his calculation. so that I check if I need to overwrite the price, and if yes I do so. afterwards he just goes on and does the whole bunch off stuff he does with the product price afterwards
[12:14:19] <gumble> I hope that is understanable
[12:14:25] <gumble> *understand-able
[12:15:15] <gumble> is that possible? or somehow to tell the code to just wait for the result?
[12:16:30] <royalty> gumble, I believe there is an option to make the request synchronous within $.post(), so basically the page will freeze until the price pops up
[12:16:44] <royalty> I think...
[12:17:44] <gumble> just found some $.when)function(){   ...    }).then(function(){  ...   });
[12:17:49] <gumble> looks like the only way..
[12:17:58] <royalty> and all I am understanding is that he does something with the price, I still don't know what you are trying to do
[12:18:13] <royalty> why are you using ajax?
[12:19:09] <gumble> I am trying to overwrite the original product_price while still letting him do all the customizations he does to the product price afterwards
[12:19:27] <royalty> gumble: are you grabbing anything from the server?
[12:19:58] <gumble> royalty: because the product price calculation is very, very complicated. it is based on user-entereed formulas....I have something that can do that on php site, doing it synchronosly on js side is just too much work
[12:20:02] <gumble> it is to much work anyway
[12:20:31] <gumble> royalty: I am posting the inputs and which formula should be used and am calculating the product price with php
[12:22:07] <royalty> gumble, ohhhh so you want to give the price to your serverside php to change it then run his JS?
[12:22:55] <gumble> royalty: I want to get the product price from the server side then let his js run over it afterwards
[12:23:40] <royalty> gumble: oh yeah, that doesn't sound very hard...
[12:24:22] <gumble> royalty: ok, I am listening, I really have no idea atm..
[12:24:31] <royalty> gumble: I am missing how the user interacts with it though
[12:24:44] <royalty> gumble: so essentially you have a form right?
[12:24:50] <gumble> yes
[12:24:51] <royalty> gumble: the user sticks in stuff in it
[12:24:56] <gumble> royalty: yap
[12:25:13] <royalty> gumble: then you want to post their stuff to your serverside php
[12:25:30] <royalty> gumble: your serverside php gets the price, and his js runs on it after
[12:25:47] <royalty> right?
[12:26:16] <gumble> yes
[12:26:20] <royalty> okay
[12:26:24] <royalty> now
[12:26:26] <gumble> but his js needs to run before and afterwards
[12:26:33] <royalty> why before?
[12:26:43] <gumble> so he has like 100 lines of code and actually need to overwrite the price at line 50 or something
[12:26:54] <gumble> because if not, he overwrites the code himself again
[12:27:03] <gumble> the js was not made to be modified I think :D
[12:27:12] <royalty> ummm
[12:27:16] <royalty> any chance you will show it?
[12:27:30] <gumble> I think I'll just use $.when()
[12:27:34] <royalty> alright
[12:27:36] <royalty> give that a try
[12:27:37] <royalty> good luck
[12:27:40] <gumble> very ugly but I rlly don't think there is a better approach
[12:27:49] <gumble> royalty: thanks a lot for the help :)
[12:29:45] <royalty> gumble: no problem
[12:34:18] <decx> is there a best practise to check if an element exist and if not append it somewhere? apart from: if (!$('.myelement')) { $('.myparent').append('.myelement') }
[12:35:10] <decx> *+.length
[12:35:14] <kpl> royalty: I was interrupted by a phone call here, so I wasn't able to answer immediately. You mentioned some code you had written. It's js and not jQuery?
[12:36:02] <kpl> royalty: There is a jQuery based example here: http://www.giveupalready.com/content.php?186-jQuery-Ajax-Form-Tutorial&s=5edcf1f77ec8678309ae067ca1cd6f48
[13:18:11] <Tomashe> Hey guys , there is a way using jquerymobile to apply touch slide event?
[13:48:43] <krastavac> http://areaaperta.com/nicescroll/ how is this scrollbar on <html> made on this page? i tried plugin couldn't make it on <html> or <body>
[14:04:56] <jacoluta> http://jsfiddle.net/W2CVH/ Any suggestions on how to move the element without the clear visual iterations on the element?
[14:09:08] <shoky> jacoluta what do you mean? you can animate, or use css transitions  http://jsfiddle.net/W2CVH/1/
[14:09:59] <jacoluta> shoky: I basically just want a smooth movement
[14:10:19] <jacoluta> while(keydown) keep going
[14:11:30] <jacoluta> which is does. but you can see where is stops, then starts again
[14:15:51] <floatmastaP> is it possible to break on class addtion / removal in chrome?
[14:27:58] <shoky> floatmastaP you can break on attributes modification, yea
[14:30:23] <Onionnion> can someone tell me why this isn't working? it's a simple .change() operation that should be disabling the button but the .change() function isn't even being called http://jsfiddle.net/Windsock/4akVT/
[14:31:27] <shoky> Onionnion: it's working fine. change event occurs only when you press enter or move out of the input
[14:31:39] <shoky> maybe you want keyup or something
[14:31:47] <Onionnion> ah I see
[14:37:48] <Onionnion> ok thanks

[14:43:34] <Vacuum> this is object oriented, but I always work this way.

[14:51:44] <Hilton> Can anyone suggest a plugin like Select2 (combination input/autocomplete/select) with fewer bugs? Select2's drop box keeps appearing off screen (bottom of page).
[15:10:46] <Eagle5> hello can someone help me with this http://pastebin.com/pk1mG9dW
[15:20:54] <coldhead> Eagle5: what is the problem you are experiencing?
[15:21:10] <Eagle5> nothing is show
[15:21:11] <Eagle5> ing
[15:21:19] <Eagle5> and console errors
[15:21:24] <Eagle5> http://www.isu.hadiismail.com/index.php
[15:21:26] <Vacuum> css link is broken
[15:21:26] <Eagle5> on here
[15:21:48] <Vacuum> remove the script in your body
[15:22:03] <Vacuum> and remove the <script> tags in your .js file
[15:22:14] <coldhead> from this file: http://www.isu.hadiismail.com/js/olympicdata.js
[15:22:38] <coldhead> also it's generally a good idea to use relative paths rather than absolute paths that include the domain name
[15:22:48] <coldhead> because you'll have to change your code if you move URLs
[15:23:16] <Vacuum> add type="text/javascript" to your script tags, it's common
[15:23:21] <Eagle5> Vacuum, i dont even use that file lol
[15:23:26] <Eagle5> and true coldhead thanks
[15:24:02] <Eagle5> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[15:25:24] <Eagle5> WORKS
[15:25:25] <Eagle5> IT WORKSS
[15:25:27] <Eagle5> thank you
[15:26:05] <Vacuum> place your script ini ia js file and call the function in a anonymous function
[15:26:07] <Vacuum> (function() { getData(); })();
[15:26:29] <Vacuum> between script tags in your body
[15:26:50] <Vacuum> it's common to do a SIAF
[15:27:06] <coldhead> but is it useful here?
[15:27:58] <Vacuum> Well, SIAF is just common use
[15:28:31] <coldhead> i know but i like to do things for a reason :)
[15:30:07] <Vacuum> it's not necessary or prohibited, your right. When I write js, I always call the object initialization using a SIAF inside my body like this (function() { Object.init(); })(Object, jQuery, $)
[15:31:06] <coldhead> that's very sensible
[15:31:54] <Vacuum> how'd you mean?
[15:32:34] <coldhead> it gives you peace of mind and passes in the global objects you care about
[15:33:57] <Vacuum> Well, I'm vacuum
[15:34:11] <AmLearning> i ran the command sudo dpkg --configure -a and it has to
[17:38:11] <hailwood> Hey guys, if I have a plugin that triggers an event (say play) I should be able to bind to it with $('#elementEventTriggersOn').on('play.myEvent') correct?
[17:38:33] <hailwood> Basically later on I want to be able to remove the specific binding from the event instead of all of the bindings to that event.
[17:39:35] <shoky> hailwood: yea that's correct
[17:40:46] <hailwood> shoky, Strange, I am using videojs and using clipPlayer.on('play', someFunc) works, using clipPlayer.on('play.myEvent', someFunc) is not getting called, any ideas why that would be?
[17:41:43] <shoky> mm i dunno, would need to see it live
[17:42:48] <hailwood> shoky, Darn, live code is behind a login system unfortunately
[17:46:30] <shoky> hailwood wait what's clipPlayer ?
[17:51:14] <hailwood> clipPlayer is the videojs instance more specificially I am doing this in a videojs component so var clipPlayer = this.player_; which is a jquery object
[17:51:31] <shoky> ok so that's not a jquery object
[17:51:40] <shoky> so doesn't support event namespaces
[17:52:30] <shoky> you can do the .on('play.myEvent', .. )  on the <video> element
[17:55:26] <hailwood> shoky, Ah cheers, got it! grabbed the underlying video element from the videoJs instance and wrapped that so, $(clipPlayer.el_).on(...
[19:07:53] <alnr> what is the simplest way to submit a form with juqery and urlencode each field?
[20:18:12] <dekiss> $("#editButton").click(function() {
[20:18:12] <dekiss>   $("#editButton").css("background-image", "url(img/buttons/save.png)");
[20:18:12] <dekiss> });
[20:18:16] <dekiss> why this is not changing image?
[20:21:33] <dekiss> this is sliding up the image to some point then it restores $("#editButton").click(function() {
[20:21:33] <dekiss>   $(this).slideUp();
[20:21:33] <dekiss> });
[20:21:35] <dekiss> why?
[20:23:03] <dekiss> because I had !important
[20:37:06] <sabotender> I am trying to use jquery's ajax call to request an image from a php script. i am not entirely sure how to get php to pass the image, since php can only access those files
[20:50:13] <dekiss> I don;t understand
[20:50:48] <dekiss> if $( uses document.querySElector why then I can't do $(eleemnt).style.backgroundImage=".. ??
[20:50:49] <lasha> sabotender: why can't you just have php return a URL string to the image?
[20:51:14] <lasha> because $(element) returns a jquery object
[20:51:16] <lasha> if you did....
[20:51:25] <lasha> $(element)[0], then it will work
[20:51:33] <lasha> or....
[20:51:33] <sabotender> lasha: because the the browser cannot access files beyond the documentroot
[20:51:33] <dekiss> what is inside this object
[20:51:36] <dekiss> hm let me see
[20:51:45] <lasha> $(element).get(0).style....
[20:52:04] <sabotender> I need to figure out how to pass image data from php to jquery via ajax call
[20:52:32] <lasha> where is the image data located?
[20:53:03] <sabotender> beyond the documentroot. only php can access this directory
[20:53:08] <dekiss> lasha thanks
[20:53:48] <lasha> dekiss: no problem.
[20:53:49] <lordmortis> couldn't you just serve it via an URL
[20:53:50] <dekiss> sabotage what is image data?
[20:53:56] <dekiss> image source code?
[20:54:02] <sabotender> who is sabotage?
[20:54:10] <dekiss> sabotender
[20:54:13] * sabotender snickers
[20:54:19] <dekiss> just get it with ajax
[20:54:22] <lordmortis> sabotender: couuldn't you just have something like: getmyimage.php?id=theimageid that returns the image data via a file open call?
[20:54:56] <dekiss> to what you refer when you say image data guys?
[20:55:24] <dekiss> lordmortis file open will not run the php code right?
[20:58:10] <sabotender> lordmortis: i do not believe that will work
[20:59:46] <dekiss> sabotender I think file open will not execute the script
[20:59:52] <dekiss> will just read the source code
[20:59:58] <lasha> if php can open a file, or access the file system
[21:00:08] <lasha> then you can certainly have it reuturn a URL
[21:00:23] <lasha> or at least the base64 represetation
[21:00:32] <lasha> which you can inject into the DOM
[21:00:38] <dekiss> I am confused
[21:00:45] <sabotender> maybe ajax will load it if php 'echoes' the image? sort of like how it will pull a text or numerical result?
[21:00:47] <dekiss> I didn't udnerstood you lasha
[21:00:59] <dekiss> sabotender what is "image data"?
[21:01:29] <dekiss> I am not sure what you want to get
[21:01:30] <sabotender> dekiss: the bytes that make up the image itself
[21:01:34] <dekiss> image file source code or.?
[21:01:37] <dekiss> aha
[21:01:38] <dekiss> so
[21:01:42] <dekiss> yes
[21:01:50] <dekiss> echo the source code of the image file with php
[21:02:01] <dekiss> then do ajax and pull this text
[21:02:03] <sabotender> huh, no thats not what i meant
[21:02:13] <sabotender> I promise it won't work
[21:02:28] <sabotender> you can NOT use a URL to access a file beyond the document root
[21:02:29] <dekiss> what you want to do I am not sure, you want to get source code of the image file?
[21:02:53] <dekiss> yes browsers have policy against that
[21:02:56] <sabotender> you have to get php to pull the data, then send this data on.
[21:03:02] <sabotender> php is the middle man here
[21:03:06] <dekiss> you can, if you give access to some file to some client
[21:03:19] <sabotender> but I want to grab this data via a jquery ajax request
[21:03:22] <dekiss> sabotender tell me what you want to do, I don't understand
[21:03:30] <dekiss> what you want to get
[21:04:53] <sabotender> image directory(inaccessable via web) -> PHP (which has permission to access the directory) -> ajax (client-side, loading data passed on from PHP)
[21:05:10] <dekiss> sabotender if you tell me what you want to do
[21:05:13] <dekiss> I might help
[21:05:17] <dekiss> I asked many times
[21:05:21] <sabotender> image directory != ajax
[21:06:04] <sabotender> what are you asking me? you are asking me to reword the same stuff I already said, I honestly cannot say it any better than that
[21:06:30] <dekiss> ok then
[21:06:32] <sabotender> but this issue may be inappropriate for this channel. I will try in #PHP again
[21:06:32] <dekiss> have fun
[21:06:37] <dekiss> don't message me anymore
[21:06:45] <sabotender> O_o
[21:13:22] <dekiss> why this returns empty sting console.log($("#editButton")[0].style.backgroundImage);
[21:13:28] <dekiss> background iamge is set with css
[21:24:00] <floatmastaP> JQUERY GENIUSES: what is wrong with this statement $("#genre-box ul li a.selected.active").val().toLowerCase();
[21:30:09] <floatmastaP> would you like to know?
[21:30:15] <floatmastaP> .val() is not valid
[21:30:22] <floatmastaP> .text() should be used instead!
[21:31:36] <floatmastaP> THE MORE YOU KNOW!

[22:32:55] <tgx> i know this is a self invoked function
[22:34:47] <tgx> if the $ is the parameter comming to the function
[22:35:19] <tgx> what is (Jquery ), what is it for
[22:39:46] <DanS326> hello?
[22:39:52] <tgx> hi
[22:41:02] <Uhkis> tgx: afaik that's the part which casts all those $Â function calls to jquery
[22:41:59] <tgx> can i pm you
[22:42:25] <tgx> i mean can i  private message you
[22:43:18] <Uhkis> yes
[22:45:47] <DanS326> ... I love it when I go somewhere with a problem then while setting up the JSFiddle for it I find the error
[23:00:57] <grafi> DanS326 thats kind of the best case scenario ;)
[23:02:08] <DanS326> was trying to use ajax in jquery and nothing I seemed to do would give me the responce .. even tho I could see it in firebugs logs
[23:03:22] <DanS326> finally I saw it I was trying to asign the response to a variable then alert the variable ... and while pasting I noticed  -->var responce = "": <--
[23:07:39] <tgx> hi all I need some help to understand  what  '$' and 'Jquery'   means in this function (function($)){  ...  })(Jquery)
[23:10:44] <Cork> tgx: same as function wrapper($) {}  wrapper(jQuery);
[23:11:56] <Cork> tgx: jQuery is the real object that holds all of jQuery
[23:12:08] <Cork> tgx: $ is just a short hand variable to access the same object
