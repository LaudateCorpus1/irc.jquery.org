[03:46:58] <cxeq> does getJSON use parseJSON automatically
[03:47:27] <cxeq> "The success callback is passed the returned data, which is typically a JavaScript object or array as defined by the JSON structure and parsed using the $.parseJSON() method. It is also passed the text status of the response."
[03:48:03] <cxeq> or is that suggesting that most people will want to use parseJSON next
[03:48:20] <Cork> cxeq: as long as the server returns json and not something else
[03:48:35] <Cork> note return json means Content-Type: application/json
[03:48:43] <Cork> or Content-Type: text/javascript
[03:51:41] <cxeq> thanks Cork
[05:44:00] <develoooper> Hey guys , I need a library creating visual flows like https://botmock.com (but not jsplumber library) , anybody knows like that library ?
[05:47:48] <develoooper> Anybody here ?
[05:48:40] <Cork> needs to be a lib or just a website for flowcharts?
[05:49:50] <develoooper> Cork: need a library
[05:49:57] <Cork> donno then
[06:16:56] <tikok> hello, I would like to have a key value pair which can make sub level. I don't really know how to represent that. Do you have any ideas or plugins ?
[06:42:32] <puddle> hi! Is there an even that gets fired when user closes the window/tab, refreshes the tab/window and when they leave to another website through a link? onbeforeunload works for the first two but doesnt fire when user just goes to an external link and actually leaves the website
[07:20:51] <Cork> puddle: onunload and onbeforeunload is the two events that exist; but be aware that they are heavily abused so browsers are reducing support more and more
[07:20:59] <Cork> puddle: and there are talks about removing them all together
[07:21:18] <Cork> (opera has never supported them)
[07:21:53] <puddle> Cork, thanks, so I shouldnt really look for an event that is fired when you dont close the browser but leave the site?
[07:22:13] <Cork> puddle: why do you need it?
[07:22:28] <puddle> Just logging when the user leaves
[07:22:29] <Cork> you should build your site so you don't have to care about it at all
[07:22:55] <puddle> kinda hard to explain why thats needed
[07:23:04] <Cork> logging it would require delaying following links and closing the tab
[07:23:21] <puddle> alright thanks
[07:23:22] <Cork> so the connection can complete before it unloads the document and kills all the connections
[07:23:29] <Cork> and that is why it is normally a bad idea
[08:02:55] <Duikb00t-home> o/ Has someone an idea what is wrong with my code? :) https://kopy.io/rgPqe  WHat I am trying to to : I wnat to check if a class exists in the dom and then do a scrollTo
[08:02:56] <Duikb00t-home> thanks
[10:15:29] <ExeciN> can I use something similar to .change() but on other elements than <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements?
[10:16:08] <ExeciN> specifically I want my code to run whenever the contents of a table change
[10:29:51] <reynierpm> should not JSON.stringify here ==> https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/yuh2m158/ convert my Javascript Array to a JSON object so I get a JSON on the backend?
[10:37:17] <localh0st> reynierpm: it should be correct IMO
[10:37:42] <localh0st> in fact it's not an object but the json string
[10:40:29] <localh0st> reynierpm: this is JSON object: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(agr))
[10:41:37] <shoky_> that's a JS object :p
[10:41:56] <shoky_> JSON is always just text
[10:43:52] <localh0st> yeah, that's why name 'JSON object' is stupid, it's not an object, it's just a bunch of letters ;p
[10:50:15] <saphaperoc> I currently have the code that is at https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/pnsnomkj/. I need each image to be wrapped in a div tag when it is displayed instead of just the image. What would I put in this? Sorry, I am new to jQuery and JavaScript
[10:54:50] <reynierpm> localh0st, ok, I was missing the parse
[10:56:22] <reynierpm> localh0st, I keep seeing this on my URL "?parent=109802&agreements_id=%5B%22111876%22%5D"
[10:56:43] <reynierpm> the %5B is because [ and the %5D is for ]
[11:01:41] <saphaperoc> I am trying to find a cleaner way to wrap <div> around the image than this: https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/pnsnomkj/1/

[12:23:37] <newbie-node_> Does anyone in here work with NodeJS? the #nodejs is locked :/
[12:31:55] <newbie-node_> how can I get a message to emit saying "user has left the game" using socket.io on a node app? just placing my emit command in my 'disconnect' function doesn't quite work
[12:33:06] <taplar> maybe hitup a node or socket.io room?
[12:33:19] <newbie-node_> node room is locked unfortunately
[12:38:05] <taplar> there isn't a nodejs room
[12:38:19] <taplar> there is a node, node-dev, node-irc, etc
[12:38:23] <taplar> use /list to search
[13:29:12] <smido> Hi, I am trying to programatically set the location for the waze live map (https://www.waze.com/livemap), using jquery: $('input.query').first().val('Los Angeles');. This works - to fill in the input, but I am unable to "press enter" in the input, or somehow submit the search. The page seems to be using jquery and backbone. Is here someone able to help ?
[13:33:22] <taplar> you could try to fake create an enter event with trigger()
[13:33:46] <taplar> but depending on how it is implemented it may have to be a real enter which you can't programatically create
[13:47:19] <smido> taplar: that's it - i've also tried that, but it didn't really work. so you say a real enter cannot be faked
[13:47:34] <smido> ?
[13:47:42] <taplar> they cannot, no
[13:48:07] <taplar> consider the security implication of if logic could do so
[13:48:35] <smido> I hope it's related to the backbone event system, so it would probably be possible to trigger it using backbone. But I didn't find a backbone IRC channel yet
[13:49:12] <taplar> #documentcloud
[13:49:40] <taplar> according to the topic of the #backbone room
[14:04:41] <smido> i'll give it a try
[14:08:32] <saphaperoc> I have a working photo gallery that uses JSON to pull images from a Flickr album. I now want to implement lightbox, which means I need to get the img url in an <a> tag around the image. The <a> tag would replace the position of the div in this code: https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/r8d49u2p/
[14:09:12] <saphaperoc> I'm having trouble getting the URL in the part that wraps around the image
[14:11:47] <taplar> so you are wanting to get the url off of the img?
[14:13:03] <taplar> why not build build the div with the url on it in the part where you are creating the img tags?
[14:15:03] <saphaperoc> I want to but <a> tags around the image with the href link the same as the image source link
[14:17:24] <saphaperoc> instead of the <div> tags that I have, rather unintuitively, wrapped around the image tag
[14:18:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/r8d49u2p/1/ ?
[14:20:01] <saphaperoc> taplar: Yes! Thank you! I will study that. Sorry, I am kinda new to jQuery
[14:20:46] <taplar> it's cool
[15:38:20] <original> Hello. I have this function that adds the class "featured block" to all li elements that have a children "menu-destacado" class. How can I add a new class only to the first li? https://jsfiddle.net/9wuqg2dz/1/
[16:09:46] <TViernion> hey guys, i'm bulding an app with Angularjs as the framework, does it already have a way in place to convert an element into an input?  I was talking with someone yesterday
[16:24:35] <sherm4n4tor> Been looking around but cannot find an answer.  Is there a way to get an <A> tag :visited,:hover color?
[16:29:29] <saphaperoc> Could someone help me run the first script before the second please? (See https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/r8d49u2p/5/)
[16:36:31] <sherm4n4tor> https://jsfiddle.net/r8d49u2p/7/
[16:37:12] <sherm4n4tor> You can put it above the script you want to run first.
[16:37:53] <saphaperoc> The justified gallery part needs to be run after the flickrGallery script has loaded all the photos
[16:37:57] <sherm4n4tor> Oh, sorry, I misread
[16:38:21] <sherm4n4tor> do you know if there's a callback for flickrGallery()?
[16:39:16] <saphaperoc> Sorry, but what is that?
[16:41:18] <saphaperoc> Here's the flickrGallery.ja file https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/
[16:42:39] <sherm4n4tor> if that plugin has a function to let you know it's done loading and you can load up the next script
[16:43:55] <saphaperoc> Not sure. Here's the plugin https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/
[16:54:22] <jak2000> hi all
[16:54:36] <jak2000> how to upload a file with jquery?
[16:58:40] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you mean via ajax?
[17:24:55] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes
[17:25:02] <jak2000> i am reading: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2302344/jquery-form-plugin-file-upload
[17:25:09] <jak2000> cn you please explain me this:
[17:25:15] <jak2000> $('#fileUploadForm').ajaxForm();
[17:25:26] <jak2000> when was execute this code?
[17:25:45] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/2302348/923919
[17:25:54] <robertmaxrees> looks pretty cut and dry to me.
[17:25:59] <robertmaxrees> that's how you initialize the plugin.
[17:27:27] <jak2000> ok
[17:27:53] <jak2000> then the uplad is started in this line: <input type="submit" value="Submit" />   wehn user  click on button submit right?
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> it's started whenever the user submits the form.
[17:28:21] <robertmaxrees> clicking that button would be one way to do that.
[17:28:52] <jak2000> ok
[17:29:23] <jak2000> i have 2 forms....... 1 of they is a Dialog Form.... if i submit these form, the main form, would NOT reload right?
[17:30:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:30:26] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't.
[17:31:20] <jak2000> strange... reload...
[17:31:23] <jak2000> testing....
[17:31:44] <robertmaxrees> shjow your js?
[17:35:20] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: https://pastebin.com/vW5rBDQ4
[17:35:29] <jak2000> Main Form: Line 140
[17:35:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not JS.
[17:35:41] <robertmaxrees> show the rendered stuff pls
[17:35:42] <jak2000> Dialog Form: Line: 189
[17:35:48] <jak2000> html
[17:35:52] <jak2000> part i upload Js
[17:36:21] <robertmaxrees> feel free to upload the rendered stuff and then toss me a link when you're done.
[17:36:24] <jak2000> https://pastebin.com/sD4Spksx   see line 1-55
[17:36:37] <jak2000> Js code
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> so $("#frm_upl_file").ajaxForm(options); is where you initialize these, right?
[17:37:16] <robertmaxrees> and i assume you're intending that for both?
[17:37:36] <jak2000> YES INITILIZE...
[17:37:38] <jak2000> sorry for caps...
[17:37:44] <robertmaxrees> that won't work that way.
[17:37:47] <robertmaxrees> IDs are unique per page.
[17:37:51] <robertmaxrees> gotta use a class there instead.
[17:38:13] <jak2000> Ids are uniqe
[17:38:15] <jak2000> where not?
[17:38:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:38:32] <robertmaxrees> you said you have 2 forms, right?
[17:38:43] <jak2000> yes
[17:38:48] <jak2000> 2 forms have different ids...
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> $("#frm_upl_file") will only ever select the first form it finds.
[17:38:58] <jak2000> yes
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> so then where's trhe initialize for the other form?
[17:39:03] <jak2000> no proble,
[17:39:28] <jak2000> mmm need init the first form? Main form?
[17:39:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:39:45] <jak2000> $("#frm_upl_file")  <--- is the form of the Dialog...
[17:40:02] <robertmaxrees> is that triggering a page reload when you submit it?
[17:40:10] <jak2000> yes
[17:40:13] <jak2000> not know why
[17:40:25] <robertmaxrees> so your problem has nothing to do with the "main form" heh
[17:40:44] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($("[id='frm_upl_file']").length); right before youy initialize it.
[17:40:49] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[17:41:16] <jak2000> line 5: console.log($("[id='frm_upl_file']").length);
[17:41:19] <jak2000> ok checking
[17:42:08] <jak2000> 1
[17:42:15] <jak2000> console say: 1
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> hrmmmm.
[17:42:54] <robertmaxrees> and no errors in your console?
[17:43:09] <jak2000> no no errors
[17:43:18] <jak2000> <button class='btn'>Subir Foto</button>   this is the submit button okey?
[17:43:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the rendered html with the rendered JS.
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> since the JS doesn't care about whatever is in the java
[17:44:32] <jak2000> done
[17:44:34] <jak2000> done!!!
[17:44:36] <jak2000> with your sample
[17:44:37] <jak2000> ufff
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:45:39] <jak2000> done
[17:45:43] <jak2000> worked with your sample
[17:45:51] <jak2000> friend... how to submit a form manually?
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> call .submit() on it >.>
[17:46:16] <robertmaxrees> so lost right now.
[17:47:53] <jak2000> thanks
[17:48:05] <robertmaxrees> did you fix your problem?
[17:48:18] <jak2000> $("#frm_upl_file").submit();
[17:48:19] <jak2000> testing
[17:48:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:50:07] <jak2000> done
[17:50:10] <jak2000> fixed the problem..
[17:50:20] <robertmaxrees> what was the fix?
[17:50:26] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[17:51:02] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.  so what was the fix?
[17:51:50] <jak2000> followed your sample...
[17:51:51] <jak2000> only
[17:52:12] <robertmaxrees> you meant he stack overflow link i sent?
[17:52:51] <jak2000> yes
[17:52:56] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> lol that was the first answer to the one you sent.
[17:53:13] <jak2000> how todo: when user click on "I've read and understand this" button
[17:53:22] <jak2000> how to close, but after 5 seconds?
[17:53:41] <robertmaxrees> so you mean when they click, wait 5 seconds and then close?
[17:53:46] <jak2000> yes
[17:53:52] <robertmaxrees> or prevent them from being able to click for 5 seconds?
[17:54:11] <jak2000> <robertmaxrees> so you mean when they click, wait 5 seconds and then close?   <--------
[17:54:17] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that???
[17:54:54] <jak2000> for gave a chance to user see 1 message....
[17:55:02] <jak2000> "File Uploaded"...
[17:55:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean when they click that button, it'll trigger the upload?
[17:56:32] <jak2000> yes
[17:56:46] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-buttons
[17:56:51] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> just gotta customize that click callback
[17:59:42] <jak2000> yes $( this ).dialog( "close" );
[17:59:53] <jak2000> but how to wait 5 seconds?
[18:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to wait 5 seconds.
[18:00:08] <robertmaxrees> you want to wait untilt he ajax call finishes.
[18:00:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/db5SX/9748/
[18:00:20] <robertmaxrees> for an example.
[18:01:10] <jak2000> ok
[18:01:31] <jak2000> think too in setTimeout
[18:04:10] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/db5SX/9749/   (:
[18:10:31] <taplar> setTimeout expects the first argument to be a callback
[18:16:35] <zampa> so i have a buch of checboxes i want to return a 1/0 for depending if they are checked or not.. whats the simplest way to do that?
[18:18:27] <jak2000> taplar :(
[18:19:29] <taplar> zampa: return where?
[18:19:33] <taplar> jak2000: sup?
[18:20:19] <jak2000> not understand
[18:20:24] <jak2000> setTimeout expects the first argument to be a callback  <----
[18:20:25] <jak2000> reading
[18:20:32] <jak2000> i am reading: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1836105/how-to-wait-5-seconds-with-jquery
[18:20:38] <taplar> window.setTimeout( $(this).dialog("close"), 5000 );
[18:20:47] <taplar> ^-- what is the first argument there?
[18:20:48] <saphaperoc> Could someone look at the last line of this and tell me what is causing the syntax error if you don't mind?   https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/2wdapoef/2/
[18:21:36] <taplar> saphaperoc: you are not including jquery in the fiddle
[18:21:54] <taplar> in the javascript area, click the "javascript <cog>" in the top right corner
[18:22:51] <saphaperoc> I have it on the page this is on, but here is the one with jQuery:   https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/2wdapoef/3/
[18:23:53] <saphaperoc> I get this error in Chroms:   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'done' of undefined
[18:23:53] <taplar> functionOne isn't returning anything
[18:24:01] <jak2000> see: setTimeout(
[18:24:02] <jak2000>   function()
[18:24:02] <jak2000>   {
[18:24:02] <jak2000>   }, 5000);
[18:24:06] <jak2000> (error escuse me)...
[18:24:42] <taplar> saphaperoc: functionOne needs to return 'r' i assume
[18:25:03] <saphaperoc> I have return r ..?
[18:25:13] <taplar> inside the method in the doc ready
[18:25:21] <taplar> not functionOne
[18:25:34] <taplar> ready() returns the jQuery object iirc
[18:25:59] <saphaperoc> Sorry, I'm still trying to figure jQuery out... Do you mind putting it in the jsfiddle?
[18:26:02] <taplar> even if it did return the r, you are not returning what it returns from functionOne so that wouldn't work anyway
[18:26:10] <taplar> one sec
[18:26:33] <saphaperoc> The goal is to run functionTwo only after functionOne has completed
[18:27:47] <taplar> does flickerGallery do something asynchronously?
[18:27:48] <saphaperoc> So I'm not sure if what I'm trying to do is the best way to do this or not
[18:28:49] <saphaperoc> flickrGallery pulls all the pictures from a particular Flickr album and puts them in a div. Here's the plugin if you want to see:  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/
[18:29:38] <saphaperoc> And then justifiedGallery justifies all the images in a neat gallery
[18:29:41] <taplar> i don't see anything async in here
[18:30:34] <taplar> do you actually tell it urls to go get the images from, or do you just point it to img elements or such?
[18:31:17] * taplar doesn't know much about flickr
[18:31:26] <saphaperoc> It uses the Flickr API to get all the images from a particular album. It returns the image URLs in JSON format
[18:32:01] <taplar> k, so it's doing some form of ajax
[18:32:11] <saphaperoc> Yes
[18:33:24] <taplar> k, so i found the docs (http://ptflickrgallery.sourceforge.net/doc/files/jquery-flickrGallery-js.html) and i'm not seeing where the author has added any kind of hooks into the process, or to get a deferred for the process.
[18:33:24] <saphaperoc> Here's the Flickr API JS file: https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/x91Lu0hv/
[18:35:10] <saphaperoc> taplar: That's not what I am using
[18:35:44] <saphaperoc> I added the deferred so it would load and finish pulling the images before the justifiedGallery runs
[18:36:00] <taplar> but you are just creating a deferred.  it's not attached to that process in any way
[18:36:20] <saphaperoc> Yes, I created it
[18:36:42] <saphaperoc> I am not sure it that's how I should be trying to do it or not
[18:36:53] <taplar> no, that's what i just said
[18:37:00] <taplar> it's not associated with the flickr in any way
[18:37:04] <taplar> you're just creating one
[18:37:09] <saphaperoc> Yes
[18:37:51] <taplar> which is why i'm trying to see if the plugin has a way to provide a callback that it will run when it is done, or if it returns a promise/deferred from flickrGallery.  so far i'm not seeing one
[18:38:22] <jak2000> robertmaxrees like me your ajax...... call...
[18:38:29] <jak2000> but only or know other way...
[18:38:34] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 huh?
[18:38:47] <jak2000> ajax call back with delay 5 seconds...
[18:38:56] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[18:39:02] <taplar> jak2000: did you understand what i said about the function?
[18:40:25] <taplar> saphaperoc: from what i can see with this plugin, without modifying it, i don't know that you can do what you are wanting to do.
[18:40:58] <saphaperoc> So there's no way to just have it load completely before running the justifiedGallery script?
[18:41:05] <taplar> if possible you might want to try to get in contact with the author and ask about it
[18:41:13] <jak2000> yes
[18:41:15] <taplar> you don't know how to tell when it is 'done'.  that's the problem
[18:41:16] <jak2000> taplar yes
[18:41:50] <taplar> jak2000: k, so you fixed that in the fiddle you shared?
[18:42:30] <jak2000> not
[18:42:33] <jak2000> ...testing... :)
[18:42:41] <saphaperoc> I've been trying to modify it... It originally had a very heavy and clunky lightbox and I stripped it down to just displaying the images. Is there a way I could add something to the end of the script to know when it's done?
[18:42:55] <taplar> yes, if i
[18:43:13] <taplar> *'m reading this right it calls the buildThumb when it has retrieved the images
[18:43:43] <saphaperoc> yes
[18:44:07] <taplar> you can modify the plugin to creat ea deferred in the initialization that it returns that then inside that method gets resolved.  or rejected in the error method
[18:46:14] <saphaperoc> taplar: Here's the original:  https://github.com/LukaszCzerwinski/jQuery-Nice-Gallery-Flickr/blob/master/js/Flickr.Gallery.js
[18:47:27] <taplar> line 18 would return from that method call
[18:47:35] <taplar> so that method would need to return a deferred
[18:47:45] <jak2000> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/urz7qafb/
[18:48:07] <jak2000> :(
[18:48:09] <jak2000> not close....
[18:48:18] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's not what you want to do.
[18:48:21] <taplar> the context of 'this' changes
[18:48:29] <saphaperoc> taplar: Sorry, but how would I do that?
[18:48:43] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what plugin are you suing to upload the file?
[18:48:58] <robertmaxrees> *using
[18:48:59] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: jquery.form.js
[18:49:05] <robertmaxrees> link to docs pls
[18:49:18] <jak2000> i am follow: http://www.simplecodestuffs.com/file-upload-with-progress-bar-using-jquery-in-servlet/
[18:49:28] <robertmaxrees> don'
[18:49:33] <robertmaxrees> woops 1 sec.
[18:49:37] <taplar> saphaperoc: that method will have to do the var something = $.Deferred(); in it, which you will return that.  then inside the method that handles the good and bad cases (ln 88 or so) in there it would reject or resolve that deferred, once you got an error, or after it builds the results.
[18:49:41] <jak2000> http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[18:49:58] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 see where it has that callback for ajaxForm?
[18:50:23] <jak2000> here: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/  ?
[18:50:26] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:50:29] <jak2000> $('#myForm').ajaxForm(function() {
[18:50:30] <jak2000> yes
[18:50:39] <robertmaxrees> that's where you want to put the modal close logic.
[18:50:44] <taplar> lol
[18:51:18] <jak2000> ok
[18:52:27] <jak2000> tablar, send me 4 bud lights....
[18:52:28] <jak2000> :p
[18:52:32] <jak2000> *taplar
[18:52:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/urz7qafb/1/
[18:52:41] <taplar> hmm?
[18:52:52] <robertmaxrees> wait http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/urz7qafb/2/
[18:53:08] <saphaperoc> taplar: So like this?  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/2wdapoef/4/
[18:53:28] <jak2000> robertmaxrees... not display the dialog..
[18:53:51] <robertmaxrees> not valid code.
[18:53:51] <taplar> no, you have to modify the plugin.  again, any deferred that you make external to the plugin will not be connected to the plugin
[18:54:05] <taplar> you understand this correct?
[18:54:06] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 just an example - i don't have the plugin loaded there.
[18:54:10] <jak2000> ok
[18:54:27] <saphaperoc> taplar: Not really...
[18:54:38] <taplar> do you understand what a deferred is?
[18:55:28] <saphaperoc> I know I have to modify the plugin, just not where.
[18:55:29] <saphaperoc> It prevents other scripts from running while it's running, right?
[18:55:38] <taplar> no, not at all
[18:55:44] <taplar> the opposite
[18:56:01] <taplar> a deferred is associated with logic that runs asynchronously
[18:56:06] <taplar> *can run
[18:56:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:56:23] <taplar> it will finish at some point in time in the future
[18:56:26] <taplar> don't know when
[18:56:34] <taplar> but it will finish, good or bad
[18:56:37] <saphaperoc> So... if I need to run the justifiedGallery after flickrgallery, do I need to defer justifiedGallery?
[18:56:49] <taplar> hold on, you need to learn this mojo man, :)
[18:57:11] <saphaperoc> That I do ;)
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a different (and many argue, better) way to manage callbacks.
[18:57:43] <taplar> So for instance when you make an ajax call, as part of the ajax logic it returns a deferred.  that deferred is associated with the work of the ajax call
[18:57:52] <taplar> it ends after the ajax call finishes, good or bad
[18:58:13] <taplar> by giving it callbacks, you tell it, "hey, when this finishes, when ever that is, do this stuff"
[18:58:26] <saphaperoc> That's what I need
[18:58:38] <taplar> right, but the key point there is the association
[18:58:45] <taplar> the deferred is associated to the ajax call
[18:58:58] <taplar> the deferred you need, needs to be associated with that flickr ajax logic
[18:59:11] <taplar> just creating a random deferred does not associate anything
[18:59:35] <saphaperoc> Ahhh, makes sense
[19:00:16] <taplar> so, if you make the flickr plugin return a deferred it makes, then you have an association
[19:00:34] <taplar> it will then be up to the flickr plugin to resolve/reject that deferred when it is done
[19:00:50] <taplar> at which point any logic you have attached to that deferred return, can run
[19:01:09] <taplar> but you have to establish that association and resolve/reject logic
[19:01:47] <saphaperoc> Ok, so I have the file trimmed down to this right now  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/1/
[19:02:03] <saphaperoc> Which just displays the images in div#gallery
[19:02:23] <taplar> yep, so first, get the flickrGallery call returning a deferred
[19:02:51] <taplar> or better yet, lets go at it from a different angle
[19:03:16] <taplar> line 36, that's your callback for the get photos it seems
[19:03:33] <taplar> and it looks like it's handling the good and bad cases
[19:03:56] <taplar> which buildThumbs looks like the good case, yes?
[19:04:06] <saphaperoc> Yes sir!
[19:04:19] <taplar> alright, so here is our good/bad split.
[19:04:43] <taplar> so what causes that to happen?
[19:04:55] <saphaperoc> So if good, buildThumb, if bad, log error in console
[19:05:06] <taplar> because at the good/bad split is where we will resolve or reject
[19:06:30] <taplar> what action do we take that makes that split happen?
[19:06:39] <saphaperoc> So I need something that says if good and the thumbnails are built, then go on to the justifiedGallery script
[19:06:49] <taplar> small steps, ;)
[19:07:19] <taplar> you are evaluating there the good/bad split of something.  what is that something?
[19:07:52] <saphaperoc> The results of trying to get the list of photos ...?
[19:07:59] <taplar> exactly
[19:08:00] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich is betther .then or .done?
[19:08:06] <robertmaxrees> .then
[19:08:37] <taplar> so we try to get the photos, which results in the good/bad split.  and we know for the good/bad split we are going to want to resolve/reject a deferred.  but to resolve/reject a deferred we need.... ?
[19:09:07] <saphaperoc> a deferred   ?
[19:09:10] <taplar> boom
[19:09:23] <taplar> so what do you think you should do?
[19:10:07] <saphaperoc> var something = $.Deferred();
[19:10:16] <taplar> go for it man
[19:10:28] <taplar> though name it something more informative than 'something', ;)
[19:11:17] <saphaperoc> Well I already see prty and buildThumb in here, so one of those?
[19:11:31] <taplar> huh?
[19:12:00] <taplar> what line are you thinking of putting your deferred creation?
[19:12:36] <saphaperoc> I was thinking it would either go in line 36 or 43
[19:13:02] <taplar> but that's inside the good/bad split, no?
[19:13:14] <taplar> that's after the request has returned
[19:13:24] <taplar> we need our deferred before hand
[19:13:27] <saphaperoc> it is... so put it before the good/bad splif?
[19:13:30] <taplar> because we need 1 deferred
[19:13:41] <taplar> you want to put it before the call even starts
[19:14:03] <taplar> getPhotos is the starts of your logic split right?
[19:14:14] <saphaperoc> yes
[19:14:25] <taplar> so before you start that, you want your single deferred that will be used by both paths of the split
[19:14:39] <taplar> one operation, one deferred
[19:14:57] <saphaperoc> So put it on top of  flickr.photosets.getPhotos  ?
[19:15:03] <taplar> yep
[19:15:39] <saphaperoc> And "something" could be anything?
[19:15:53] <taplar> yep, but it helps to make it meaningful for later reading
[19:16:21] <saphaperoc> gallery-list?
[19:16:32] <taplar> is it a gallerylist?
[19:16:40] <taplar> or is it a gallerylistdeferred?
[19:16:47] <taplar> ;)
[19:17:04] <taplar> can't have '-' in variable names
[19:17:16] <taplar> js will think you are trying to subtract and error
[19:17:46] <saphaperoc> Well I am good at algebra ;)
[19:17:55] <saphaperoc> But anyway, like this  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/2/  ?
[19:18:10] <taplar> yep
[19:18:30] <saphaperoc> So is that all I needed in the plugin js?
[19:18:33] <taplar> alright, so any time you call flickrGallery and it goes through this logic, before it tries to get the photos, it will create a deferred
[19:18:56] <taplar> but, we still don't have anything resolving or rejecting the promise
[19:19:08] <taplar> *deferred
[19:19:37] <taplar> so just some knowledge.
[19:19:50] <taplar> deferred.resolve() <-- this tells the deferred that it was successful
[19:19:57] <saphaperoc> So that will go in the good/bad split?
[19:20:04] <taplar> deferred.reject() <-- this tells the deferred that it was not successful
[19:20:15] <taplar> you can optionally give the methods inputs
[19:20:20] <taplar> yep
[19:20:48] <saphaperoc> Do I want deferred.resolve()  after the HTML structure in the plugin js?
[19:21:15] <saphaperoc> Since I dont want to run the justifiedGallery until the HTML is there
[19:21:23] <taplar> so as far as i can tell, buildThumb isn't doing anything asynchronously, so you don't really have to pass the deferred in there
[19:21:46] <taplar> so this should be a simple as calling resolve or reject as the last thing of the good and bad paths, respectively
[19:22:28] <saphaperoc> Like this?  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/3/
[19:22:54] <taplar> yes, however your variable name is not the same as what you made
[19:23:22] <saphaperoc> ?
[19:23:36] <taplar> you created 'gallerydeferred', not 'deferred'
[19:23:58] <saphaperoc> Duh, sorry :)
[19:24:02] <taplar> np
[19:24:10] <saphaperoc> https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/4/
[19:24:44] <taplar> alright!  we are creating a deferred, making the request, then resolving or rejecting it depending on the good or bad case!
[19:24:55] <taplar> so now what are we missing?
[19:25:17] <saphaperoc> What goes with that in the html and justufuedGallery?
[19:25:33] <taplar> yep, so what is the issue with that?
[19:25:41] <saphaperoc> It's not there ;)
[19:25:46] <taplar> where is it?
[19:26:47] <saphaperoc> Is that where I go back to this  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/2wdapoef/  ?
[19:27:13] <taplar> your logic is outside the plugin, right?
[19:27:32] <saphaperoc> yes. that is in the scripts section of my HTML
[19:27:42] <taplar> but our deferred is inside our plugin
[19:27:48] <saphaperoc> Correct
[19:28:00] <taplar> what's the goal there then?
[19:28:12] <saphaperoc> Connect them together?
[19:28:16] <taplar> which way?
[19:28:18] <oojacoboo> it is possible to remove elements from a jq object without affecting the DOM?
[19:28:32] <saphaperoc> taplar: With the deferred and variable?
[19:28:34] <taplar> oojacoboo: you can filter()
[19:28:47] <oojacoboo> taplar: how would that work out?
[19:29:06] <oojacoboo> oh, I see - constructs a new object
[19:29:38] <taplar> saphaperoc: right, but do you want to move your outer logic into the plugin, or move the deferred from the plugin to the outer?
[19:30:36] <saphaperoc> I was trying to move the deferred to the outer, but what is the best?
[19:30:42] <taplar> that is
[19:30:52] <taplar> you want your plugin to be independent
[19:31:13] <taplar> so we need to get the deferred created in the plugin back out to the other logic for it to use it
[19:32:11] <saphaperoc> So put  var gallerydeferred = $.Deferred();  in the outer?
[19:32:29] <taplar> nope, then it wouldn't be associated with the photo retrieval anymore
[19:32:39] <taplar> what you have right now is good, we just have to add to it
[19:33:00] <taplar> so think about what we have with the deferred
[19:33:36] <saphaperoc> It resolves if there's no error
[19:34:01] <taplar> 'it' ?
[19:34:12] <saphaperoc> The deferred
[19:34:16] <taplar> where is that at?
[19:35:25] <saphaperoc> before getPhotos
[19:35:34] <taplar> where is that at?
[19:35:51] <saphaperoc> In the plugin  ...?
[19:35:59] <taplar> you jumped out too far, heh
[19:36:47] <taplar> the deferred is before getPhotos.  and both those are in ...
[19:37:09] <saphaperoc> function
[19:37:21] <taplar> ah, which function?
[19:37:53] <saphaperoc> function(gDiv, settings)
[19:38:07] <taplar> read a little to the left
[19:38:19] <saphaperoc> Setup
[19:38:23] <taplar> there
[19:38:32] <taplar> when you see something like Setup: function()
[19:38:46] <taplar> what that is doing is creating a function and assigning it to that name, inside an object
[19:38:57] <taplar> ex. { test: function(){} }
[19:39:34] <taplar> var x = { test: function(){} }; x.test();
[19:39:42] <taplar> get it?
[19:40:09] <saphaperoc> So the function is assigned to something
[19:40:20] <taplar> yep.  it's just another way of grouping funtions
[19:40:22] <taplar> *functions
[19:40:25] <saphaperoc> But what is the something?
[19:40:40] <taplar> the something?
[19:40:46] <taplar> oh
[19:41:04] <taplar> look at line 13
[19:41:24] <taplar> that's what it is nested under
[19:41:46] <saphaperoc> prty ?
[19:42:18] <taplar> yep, it's creating an object and storing it in the prty variable.  one of the object keys being Setup which is our method
[19:43:14] <saphaperoc> So I do something with var prty in the script in my html
[19:43:16] <taplar> but back to our issue.  so our deferred is being created in the Setup function
[19:43:16] <saphaperoc> ?
[19:43:46] <taplar> and we just saw that Setup belongs to prty
[19:43:55] <saphaperoc> Yes
[19:43:56] <taplar> so some where in the logic it must be doing prty.Setup()
[19:45:35] <taplar> see it?
[19:46:02] <saphaperoc> It makes snese
[19:46:11] <taplar> i mean you see where it is being called?
[19:46:55] <saphaperoc> Above prty (line 9)
[19:47:07] <taplar> yep, but what is that?
[19:47:55] <taplar> or more importantly, how does that get invoked?
[19:49:00] <saphaperoc> I'm not quite sure
[19:49:15] <taplar> does it look familiar at all?
[19:50:06] <taplar> the method name doesn't make you think of something?
[19:50:32] <saphaperoc> It look familiar
[19:50:41] <saphaperoc> But I don't know why
[19:50:47] <taplar> 'flickrGallery' has a nice ring to it
[19:51:18] <taplar> you haven't seen that in any of your other code or anything?
[19:51:37] <saphaperoc> prty.Setup?
[19:51:45] <taplar> no, flickrGallery
[19:51:46] <chuck_testa> JQUERY SUCKS ASS
[19:51:52] <chuck_testa> no?
[19:52:16] <saphaperoc> taplar: I've seen that
[19:52:29] <taplar> where at?
[19:52:47] <saphaperoc> $(document).ready(function() {
[19:52:47] <saphaperoc>                 $("#work").flickrGallery({
[19:52:56] <taplar> :)
[19:53:05] <taplar> so what does that make you think?
[19:54:00] <saphaperoc> That my deferred goes in that
[19:54:14] <taplar> That's your initialization method
[19:54:18] <saphaperoc> Yes
[19:54:23] <taplar> that's the method that the plugin exposes for you to use
[19:54:42] <saphaperoc> Yes, and I put my options under that (API Key, etc)
[19:55:34] <taplar> ok, so you are calling flickrGallery() which is turning around and calling Setup(), which is creating the deferred and then calling getPhotos() which is then as a result resolving or rejecting the deferred.  yes?
[19:56:10] <saphaperoc> Yes
[19:56:24] <taplar> but you want your deferred back out where you called flickrGallery() from
[19:56:45] <taplar> how do we do that?
[19:56:47] <saphaperoc> It doesn't really matter to me as long as it works :)
[19:57:12] <taplar> it should though.  'it works' vs 'i understand it' is very important
[19:57:25] <taplar> especially if you have to maintain the stuff.  i'm not always going to be here, ;)
[19:58:06] <saphaperoc> I know, but won't keeping it in the plugin be easier to understand?
[19:58:33] <taplar> i'm not sure i understand what you mean by that
[19:59:20] <taplar> you mean the deferred?
[19:59:26] <saphaperoc> yes
[19:59:37] <taplar> if you keep it in the plugin it would never be used, no?
[19:59:53] <taplar> we are creating it so that it can be used by the outside logic
[20:00:10] <saphaperoc> Oh, yes :banghead:
[20:00:10] <taplar> that is it's whole purpose
[20:00:45] <taplar> so given the chain of events that we have, how do we get the deferred back outside?
[20:01:55] <saphaperoc> I have to assign something in the plugin the variable of galleydeferred and put the $.Deferred() outside?
[20:02:04] <taplar> why?
[20:02:10] <taplar> the assign i mean
[20:02:31] <saphaperoc> The   var gallerydeferred   part?
[20:02:40] <taplar> function call -> function call -> create deferred
[20:02:56] <taplar> what do we know about function calls?
[20:03:30] <saphaperoc> They're like
[20:03:31] <saphaperoc> $(document).ready(function() {
[20:03:31] <saphaperoc>                 $("#work").flickrGallery({
[20:03:36] <taplar> in general
[20:03:38] <taplar> what is a function?
[20:04:08] <taplar> i think you are over thinking this.  simple stuff.  what do we know about functions
[20:04:14] <saphaperoc> Something to reference something in jQuery
[20:04:25] <taplar> completely independent to jquery
[20:04:33] <taplar> just javascript.  what do we know about javascript functions?
[20:04:52] <saphaperoc> Something that does a certain task
[20:05:00] <taplar> and then?
[20:05:23] <saphaperoc> goes on to the next thing?
[20:05:37] <taplar> sum(1, 2); sum(5, 4); sum(7, 10);
[20:05:42] <taplar> that doesn't really make sense
[20:05:55] <taplar> what am i missing?
[20:06:12] <saphaperoc> The end?
[20:06:19] <taplar> what do you mean?
[20:06:34] <saphaperoc> The script has to end before going on to the next one
[20:06:43] <taplar> how does it end?
[20:06:55] <taplar> and function, not script
[20:08:10] <saphaperoc> A function is just something like this, right?
[20:08:14] <saphaperoc> function myFunction(p1, p2) {
[20:08:14] <saphaperoc>     return p1 * p2;
[20:08:14] <saphaperoc> }
[20:08:18] <taplar> boom!
[20:08:21] <taplar> what is that
[20:08:26] <taplar> you've yet to say that, :)
[20:08:50] <saphaperoc> What is which part?
[20:09:05] <taplar> "Something that does a certain task" ....
[20:09:14] <taplar> AND returns a result
[20:09:21] <saphaperoc> Yes
[20:09:27] <taplar> yes!!! lol
[20:09:49] <taplar> functions can return results
[20:10:13] <taplar> and we have function call -> function call -> create deferred
[20:11:31] <saphaperoc> So I call the function, call prty part, then create deferred
[20:11:32] <saphaperoc> ?
[20:11:39] <taplar> that is what you are doing right now
[20:12:51] <saphaperoc> So create the deferred in the outside instead of inside the plugin?
[20:13:08] <taplar> no man
[20:13:24] <taplar> you are calling a function, which calls another function, which creates your deferred
[20:13:30] <taplar> and functions can return things
[20:13:35] <taplar> so....
[20:13:43] <saphaperoc> So just call the function
[20:13:48] <taplar> and ....
[20:13:55] <saphaperoc> return gallerydeferred
[20:13:58] <taplar> yes
[20:15:35] <saphaperoc> Like this?  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/2wdapoef/5/
[20:15:54] <taplar> that's outside of the plugin...
[20:16:07] <saphaperoc> yes
[20:16:10] <jak2000> taplar....
[20:16:15] <taplar> which is not where the deferred is
[20:16:38] <taplar> at this point i really feel like you are trolling me
[20:17:39] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[20:17:41] <saphaperoc> No, I am certainly not. I just don't see where to return it. Do you know of a good resource where I can study jQuery?
[20:17:53] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[20:17:56] <taplar> this isn't jquery, the is vanilla js logic
[20:18:02] <robertmaxrees> but also: learn js.
[20:18:04] <taplar> the return part that is
[20:18:16] <taplar> look, you created the deferred in the Setup.  that is where the deferred currently is
[20:18:34] <taplar> you have to return it out, all the way back to where the logic chain began
[20:21:03] <jak2000> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/2q8qzcmg/
[20:21:06] <jak2000> its good?
[20:21:42] <robertmaxrees> why would you use a timeout duder?
[20:21:55] <robertmaxrees> you realize that timeout could finish well before/after the ajax call, right jak2000?
[20:22:20] <jak2000> yes
[20:22:25] <jak2000> hi robertmaxrees!!
[20:22:29] <jak2000> i am at home
[20:22:30] <robertmaxrees> so why do you keep trying to do this via a timeout?
[20:22:40] <robertmaxrees> when i've given you the answer multiple times?
[20:23:46] <jak2000> ok,
[20:23:49] <jak2000> understandding
[20:23:52] <jak2000> see please: https://pastebin.com/garFY9rN
[20:23:52] <taplar> saphaperoc: you still with me or are you reading the learn.jquery.com ?
[20:24:05] <saphaperoc> I was reading up a little
[20:24:16] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's almost 250 lines.  what does that have to do with my question?
[20:24:26] <jak2000> when finish, upload the file, call complete ... line: 29
[20:24:33] <taplar> k, if you want to do that i'll take the opportunity the head to the house, ;)
[20:24:35] <jak2000> you recommended me
[20:24:43] <jak2000> set tehe timedout here:
[20:24:44] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you mean $("#message").html("<font color='blue'>Su Archivo se Subio con Exito!!</font>"); ?
[20:24:45] <saphaperoc> But when you say back to where the logic chain began, does that mean the return goes before where I created the deferred
[20:24:47] <jak2000> $("#frm_upl_file").ajaxForm(options);
[20:24:49] <jak2000> line 35?
[20:25:02] <jak2000> yes:  $("#message").html("<font color='blue'>Su Archivo se Subio con Exito!!</font>");
[20:25:04] <taplar> no, when you do a return, what comes after the return is what gets returned
[20:25:05] <robertmaxrees> where are you confused?
[20:25:31] <saphaperoc> so there's the resolve and there's a return?
[20:25:49] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you put that modal close in that complete.
[20:25:59] <taplar> return is a javascript operation
[20:26:24] <taplar> it says, return from this function back to where it came from, and optionally return what follows
[20:26:43] <taplar> return (1 + 2);  would exit out of the function, returning the value 3
[20:26:48] <taplar> to where ever it was called from
[20:27:04] <saphaperoc> so return you go around the image url?
[20:27:07] <jak2000> yes in completete woud be....
[20:27:08] <saphaperoc> would go *
[20:27:14] <taplar> you return last
[20:27:15] <jak2000> see line 53?
[20:27:32] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 instead of making me shuttle around your file, try asking a question ;)
[20:27:33] <jak2000> $("#frm_upl_file").submit(); here i think, after submit, setttimeout... and close.
[20:27:38] <taplar> return always exists the function it is in.  so you can't have any logic after it that you want to execute, as it will not
[20:27:43] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 no
[20:27:51] <jak2000> ok you recommend me on 'complete' ?
[20:28:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you put the dialog close logic in the complete callback.
[20:28:04] <taplar> function() { return 3; console.log('this console would never happen'); }
[20:28:06] <jak2000> ok
[20:28:09] <saphaperoc> taplar: so simply put return;
[20:28:20] <taplar> no, that doesn't return anything
[20:28:28] <taplar> return <what to return>;
[20:28:34] <jak2000> other question its correct use settimeout or use your advice with a ajax callback with delay:5 ?
[20:28:54] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 the delay:5 was only there to force jsfiddle to wait.  in practice you wouldn't use tyhat.
[20:29:03] <robertmaxrees> you don't force the user to wait longer than they have to.,
[20:29:37] <saphaperoc> return function; ?
[20:29:45] <taplar> you aren't wanting to return a function
[20:29:52] <taplar> you are wanting to return the deferred
[20:30:15] <saphaperoc> return gallerydeferred;
[20:30:16] <saphaperoc> ?
[20:30:18] <taplar> yes
[20:30:44] <saphaperoc> and put that right after gallerydeferred.resolve();   ?
[20:30:59] <jak2000> i want wait 1 second or 2..... for user see the blue message
[20:31:03] <taplar> if you do that at the end of Setup, then deferred will be returned to the method that called it, in this case the flickrGallery function
[20:31:49] <saphaperoc> So where do I want to put it then?
[20:31:52] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 why?
[20:31:55] <taplar> at the end of Setup
[20:32:09] <saphaperoc> Right before the  }  ?
[20:32:25] <taplar> is that the end of the function?
[20:32:48] <jak2000> ok
[20:32:50] <jak2000> ya understand
[20:32:51] <jak2000> thanks
[20:33:15] <saphaperoc> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/5/
[20:33:33] <taplar> yay!
[20:33:48] <taplar> Setup is now returning the deferred we created
[20:33:58] <taplar> what does that mean?
[20:34:29] <saphaperoc> I can run justifiedGallery?
[20:34:36] <taplar> no
[20:34:49] <taplar> what does returning the deferred do?
[20:35:26] <saphaperoc> It ends the function and returns the buildThumb part  ..?
[20:35:37] <taplar> huh?
[20:35:40] <taplar> buildThumb?
[20:35:58] <saphaperoc> prty.buildThumb();
[20:35:58] <saphaperoc>                     gallerydeferred.resolve();
[20:36:14] <taplar> the return has nothing to do with buildThumb
[20:36:22] <taplar> you are returning the deferred.  that's it
[20:38:31] <taplar> where is the deferred being returned to?
[20:39:00] <saphaperoc> Setup
[20:39:07] <taplar> you were in Setup
[20:39:55] <saphaperoc> So the function?
[20:39:59] <taplar> which one?
[20:40:25] <taplar> if you're not specific i'm going to keep poking you, :)
[20:40:31] <saphaperoc> flickrGallery
[20:40:36] <taplar> alright
[20:40:54] <taplar> so the deferred is being returned to flickrGallery.  so what's the next step?
[20:42:55] <saphaperoc> Get that on the page?
[20:43:12] <taplar> you're still missing a piece
[20:43:35] <taplar> with what you have now, is the deferred available to the outer logic yet?
[20:44:04] <saphaperoc> I guess not...
[20:44:15] <taplar> why not?
[20:44:33] <saphaperoc> It has been returned but not called?
[20:44:47] <taplar> it's been returned from Setup to flickrGallery
[20:44:54] <saphaperoc> yes
[20:44:58] <taplar> right
[20:45:29] <taplar> the function flickrGallery is available outside the plugin, anything inside of it is not
[20:45:30] <saphaperoc> So now I need to get it from flickrGallery
[20:45:33] <taplar> yes
[20:46:00] <saphaperoc> So is that just
[20:46:01] <saphaperoc> $(document).ready(function() {
[20:46:01] <saphaperoc>             $("#work").flickrGallery({
[20:46:12] <taplar> flickrGallery is a function
[20:46:43] <saphaperoc> yes
[20:46:56] <taplar> so think about all the things we've done so far related to that statement
[20:47:13] <saphaperoc> I have to call the function?
[20:47:21] <taplar> dude
[20:47:37] <taplar> what do you think you are doing in that document ready?
[20:47:52] <taplar> it's not a trick quesiton
[20:49:51] <taplar> we know things about functions
[20:51:10] <saphaperoc> So what do I need to do then?
[20:51:38] <taplar> do what i said.  think about what you've done so far and what you know about functions
[20:52:45] <taplar> as was the case with Setup
[20:53:58] <saphaperoc> So far, I've added a deferred to Setup, have the good/bad split with resolve/reject, and have returnned the deferred to flickrGallery. I know that functions do things and return the result.
[20:54:12] <taplar> yep
[20:55:05] <saphaperoc> So I need to return that part somewhere?
[20:55:11] <taplar> boom
[20:55:34] <saphaperoc> So return flickrGallery to the main function?
[20:55:48] <taplar> return -from- flickrGallery
[20:55:51] <taplar> but yes
[20:56:20] <saphaperoc> so put   return flickrGallery;   at the end of the function?
[20:56:37] <taplar> flickrGallery is the function name.  you don't want to return the function
[20:57:16] <taplar> what should be returned
[20:57:16] <saphaperoc> sorry, return Setup;
[20:57:22] <taplar> that's the other function
[20:57:30] <taplar> wait, yes
[20:57:39] <taplar> if you mean return at the Setup call
[20:58:46] <saphaperoc> I already have it this far  https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/6/
[20:59:16] <taplar> yep, so you are missing your return in the flickrGallery as you stated
[21:00:10] <saphaperoc> https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/7/
[21:00:25] <taplar> Setup is the other function
[21:00:35] <taplar> you want to return the deferred
[21:00:57] <saphaperoc> so have 2 different return gallerydeferred ?
[21:01:25] <taplar> yes.  Setup returns the gallerydeferred to flickrGallery, but right now flickrGallery isn't doing anything with it.
[21:01:38] <taplar> so if you return -that-, then it will be returned out of flickrGallery
[21:01:47] <saphaperoc> https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/8/
[21:02:05] <taplar> no, that variable doesn't exist in flickr
[21:02:10] <taplar> look at it this way
[21:02:18] <taplar> prty.Setup($(this), opts);
[21:02:22] <taplar> that is being called
[21:02:39] <taplar> anything that is returned, you can imagine that it is popping out the left side of it
[21:02:49] <taplar> it doesn't have a name, it's just showing up there
[21:03:10] <taplar> you can store it in a variable by putting 'var x = ' in front of it
[21:03:15] <taplar> or
[21:03:30] <taplar> you can just stick return in front of it and it will throw it right along out of the function
[21:04:16] <saphaperoc> Put a return in front of which?
[21:04:23] <taplar> that method call
[21:04:41] <taplar> return prty.Setup($(this), opts);
[21:05:01] <saphaperoc> https://jsfiddle.net/hjpd/o660zr0m/9/
[21:05:20] <taplar> without line 20, yes
[21:05:52] <saphaperoc> Ok, done!
[21:06:02] <taplar> -that- will cause it to return the result of setup out of flickrGallery, but to do that it has to execute it first, which will create the deferred and return it, which then gets returned outside the plugin
[21:06:32] <taplar> so now you just need to store that deferred returned from the plugin in your outer logic in a variable, and then you can attach whatever logic to it that you want.
[21:06:33] <saphaperoc> Makes more sense now, thank you! So now if I want that before justifiedGallery...??
[21:06:57] <taplar> and with that, my azz is going home.
[21:06:58] <taplar> :D
[21:07:23] <saphaperoc> Thanks, I will work on it some more. Thanks again so much for your time!!
[21:08:21] <taplar> np man.  others are available if you still have questions, but i would highly recommend looking into an intro to javascript book or tutorial.  it would greatly benefit you to get some of these concepts down square under your belt
[21:08:52] <taplar> as such, hasta luego all
[21:08:56] <saphaperoc> Do you think I can rely on my JS class at college to teach it well enough?
[21:09:10] <taplar> i don't see why not
[21:09:33] <taplar> lots of good net tutorials out there too.
[21:09:41] <saphaperoc> Well I have that coming up. I will try to get some online classes done thissummer so I have a decent grasp before then though
[21:09:53] <taplar> good deal.  take care
[21:10:02] <saphaperoc> You too
[21:25:15] <jak2000> robertmaxrees want a beer?
[21:28:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:28:30] <robertmaxrees> you're obsessed ;)
[22:51:39] <nights> hi
[22:51:43] <nights> for some reason this line
[22:51:49] <nights> $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: $('#checkout_reviewpanel').offset().top + $('#checkout_reviewpanel').height() }, 500);
[22:52:15] <nights> behaves very differently on jquery-3.2.1 vs jquery-1.8.2
[22:52:39] <nights> i checked the values of top and height and they are the same for both versions, what could be the difference?
[22:56:56] <nights> no actually i take the latter back
[22:57:08] <nights> $('#checkout_reviewpanel').offset().top;  changed between the versions
[22:57:19] <nights> guess thats it. cheers
[23:02:52] <arosen> nights: how did it change?
[23:07:57] <nights> actually it was another problem
[23:08:08] <nights> i understand the issue though
[23:08:10] <nights> $('#checkout_reviewpanel').slideDown( 500 );
[23:08:10] <nights> $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: $('#checkout_reviewpanel').offset().top + $('#checkout_reviewpanel').height() }, 500);
[23:08:14] <nights> i had these two lines
[23:08:30] <nights> this order of these lines makes more sense
[23:10:23] <nights> but for some reason it didnt matter before, but in latest jquery offset().top would give 0 unless the slideDown already started on the line before
[23:10:53] <nights> although you would think it would get a different value after the slide animation would start... so i'd say this is a bug in jquery 3.2.1
[23:22:28] <jrroe> is it valid to have multiple $(function () {} ?
