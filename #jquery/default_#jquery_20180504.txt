[05:49:03] <mazert_> hello everyone, I would like to select all input elements where data-bind attribute start with a given string
[05:49:13] <mazert_> for example : $("input[data-bind~='KendoDatePicker']")
[05:49:41] <mazert_> but i've got zero results, where I'm wrong ? Thanks in advance
[05:50:19] <Cork> mazert_: i would recommend adding a class to those elements
[05:51:36] <mazert_> I already have a class but i need to select through data-bind attributes
[05:52:04] <Cork> wait you want to select the actual attribute?
[05:52:21] <Cork> (else just use the class)
[05:52:34] <mazert_> Cork: no, I want to select the input elements
[05:52:52] <Cork> ya, and that is what i meant you should use a class for
[05:53:02] <Cork> searching for partial content in an attribute is slow and messy
[05:53:52] <mazert_> You surely right, but it is for an hotfix and manually adding classes to these input elements will take to long time
[05:54:16] <mazert_> I'm ok to search for partial content :)
[07:01:47] <Cork> mazert_: how is the value set on the element?
[07:02:20] <Cork> (and also what is the content you're trying to select it from?)
[07:55:07] <mazert_> Cork: the value is set manually on the element, and I want to update dynamically the content of each input[data-bind|="kendoDatePicker"]
[07:56:10] <Cork> hmm if you haven't solved it already make a jsfiddle
[08:00:51] <mazert_> Cork: ok, here : https://jsfiddle.net/jpxqr2un/
[08:03:36] <Cork> mazert_: there is no kendoDatePicker in -bind
[08:03:53] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/jpxqr2un/1/
[08:05:12] <mazert_> Cork: oh sorry, i pasted the wrong line : https://jsfiddle.net/jpxqr2un/2/
[08:05:43] <Cork> ok, and what exactly is it you want to do to this element?
[08:06:52] <mazert_> i want to change de value of data-bind, more precisly : adding a entry in the dictionnary.
[08:07:51] <Cork> well you don't have a dictionary
[08:07:55] <mazert_> Cork: but my problem is to access the element first (only though data-bing attributes cause i have multiple of these input)
[08:08:02] <Cork> you just have a space separated key: value string
[08:08:30] <Cork> (meaning there isn't anything in native js or jquery to help you parse that)
[08:10:23] <mazert_> Cork: ok well, but here i didn't pasted the entire value I have (too long for demo purpose), so trust me it is a dictionnary
[08:10:48] <Cork> and by "dictionnary" you mean json object?
[08:13:31] <Cork> anyway that is your problem https://jsfiddle.net/jpxqr2un/3/
[08:28:03] <mazert_> Cork: yes I mean a Json object. Ah ok, so we have to search the substring whatever its position in the attribute value.
[08:28:29] <Cork> mazert_: as it isn't what the dom has special selectors for ya
[08:28:35] <mazert_> I thought it was possible to use |=
[08:29:10] <Cork> it has : not -
[08:29:12] <Cork> so no
[08:30:32] <mazert_> ok i see, well your solution is satisfactory for me
[08:30:38] <mazert_> thanks you very much
[10:41:56] <MikeD_> I have an app with jquery sparklines near the right edge of the window, and the tooltip sometimes causes horizontal scrollbars ... is there a way to force the tooltip to right-align to the mouse?
[12:13:03] <toothfairy_> Hi, having some smaller problems with a slider... The div slides down, but not up... Any ideas?  https://dpaste.de/Jkt2
[12:25:04] <shoky> you can use .slideToggle()
[14:45:51] <Levin^> hello
[14:45:52] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MGvRvV
[14:45:56] <Levin^> instructions inside!
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:47:29] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you can't ask your question here?
[14:48:04] <Levin^> to avoid flood, but ok
[14:48:10] <Levin^> Question: How do I add text before the extension of an image url?
[14:48:15] <Levin^> Example: flower.jpg goes to flower-150x150.jpg
[14:48:44] <Levin^> I thought it makes simpler for whoever is looking to help
[14:49:19] <robertmaxrees> it surfaces the question to the channel better :)
[14:49:33] <Levin^> oh
[14:49:57] <robertmaxrees> so it looks like you got started on that.
[14:50:08] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[14:50:23] <Levin^> I tried regex but it didn't react, so I was unsure
[14:50:33] <robertmaxrees> "it didn't react"?
[14:50:42] <Levin^> it did nothing
[14:50:43] <robertmaxrees> first off - open your console.
[14:50:51] <robertmaxrees> uncomment those lines and look at your console.
[14:51:15] <robertmaxrees> that's your first problem ;)
[14:51:46] <Levin^> it shows nothing :/
[14:51:58] <Levin^> oh
[14:52:11] <Levin^> the codepen console shows nothing, but my browser does
[14:52:29] <robertmaxrees> "the codepen console"?
[14:52:35] <Levin^> yes
[14:53:05] <Levin^> it has a console at the bottom left of the screen
[14:53:07] <robertmaxrees> what's the codepen console?
[14:53:15] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> i ignore that hahaha
[14:53:26] <Levin^> lol
[14:53:33] <robertmaxrees> so do you see the first issue with that error?
[14:53:47] <Levin^> replace is not a function
[14:54:04] <Levin^> right now I tried replaceWith(), but it seems it doesn't read regex
[14:54:07] <robertmaxrees> uncomment both lines.
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> so it works like this:
[14:54:28] <robertmaxrees> 1) you need to grab the value of the src property
[14:54:34] <robertmaxrees> 2) you need to manipulate that string
[14:54:41] <robertmaxrees> 3) you then set the source property with the new string.
[14:55:06] <robertmaxrees> so start with 1 - how do you get the source property value.
[14:55:46] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ELvJBz this version is much closer to where you want to be.
[14:55:49] <Levin^> .attr('src')
[14:55:59] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:56:09] <robertmaxrees> so now how would you manipulate that string?
[14:58:55] <robertmaxrees> >>>
[14:59:00] <robertmaxrees> *>.>
[14:59:30] <Levin^> a sec lol
[15:04:08] <Levin^> ok, I get its .attr()
[15:04:10] <Levin^> hmm
[15:05:02] <Levin^> oh, it worked
[15:09:46] <Levin^> ok, done
[15:09:47] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MGvRvV
[15:10:04] <Levin^> but, do I need to rewrite <img> as I did there?
[15:10:23] <Levin^> is append() useful there?
[15:15:11] <Levin^> oh, not needed
[15:15:26] <Levin^> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:49:16] <robertmaxrees> back.
[15:49:45] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ there's a better way to do this.
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> do $small.attr('src', $filename);
[15:50:40] <robertmaxrees> although now i have questions :)
[16:00:43] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: oh?
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> well, why do you need to resize the images that way in the first place?
[16:02:23] <Levin^> check the Downloads sidebar at this page:
[16:02:24] <Levin^> http://seppia.com.br/escola-park-tool-abre-unidade-em-belo-horizonte-cursos-ja-estao-disponiveis-para-inscricao/
[16:02:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:44] <Levin^> it's working the way it should now :)
[16:03:02] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:03:10] <robertmaxrees> you just want smaller versions of the images, right?
[16:03:17] <Levin^> yea
[16:03:25] <robertmaxrees> because your code has flaws.
[16:03:34] <robertmaxrees> like it assumes you'll only ever have one image.
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> it also requires a second download for the new iamge.
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> *image
[16:03:44] <Levin^> now I'm writing that part of the code
[16:03:57] <Levin^> if there's no low-res image, use the high-res
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> if you can't render them the right way at first, use CSS.
[16:04:08] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MGvMmy
[16:04:25] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't need the network overhead to request the image again.
[16:04:53] <Levin^> oh
[16:07:38] <Levin^> but in my real environment, there's only one image rendered
[16:07:51] <robertmaxrees> right, but
[16:08:02] <robertmaxrees> okay so on pageload you've still got that image tag, right?
[16:08:05] <Levin^> if you check my link, you can see there's only one image and two links
[16:08:13] <robertmaxrees> so the browser hits that and downloads the image.
[16:08:24] <robertmaxrees> then you change the source, and the browser goes and downloads the second one.
[16:08:29] <robertmaxrees> even though you only used one.
[16:08:35] <Levin^> oh
[16:08:40] <robertmaxrees> the browser still has to download both.
[16:08:45] <robertmaxrees> just use CSS in this case.
[16:08:50] <robertmaxrees> if you can'
[16:09:07] <robertmaxrees> *can't render the images out the right way on pageload, css is your next best bet.
[16:09:22] <Levin^> hm
[16:10:11] <robertmaxrees> also: the less js you need to execute, the better ;)
[16:10:16] <robertmaxrees> especially for stuff like this.
[16:10:39] <Levin^> hm
[16:11:11] <robertmaxrees> trust me on this one :)
[16:13:50] <Levin^> okei master
[16:21:53] <Levin^> o_o
[16:21:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:22:23] <Levin^> if you open the Network tab of your inspector and search for the keywork "baixa"
[16:22:32] <Levin^> it only shows the image once
[16:22:36] <robertmaxrees> i donm'
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> *don't have your page open any more.
[16:22:46] <Levin^> oh
[16:22:49] <Levin^> http://seppia.com.br/escola-park-tool-abre-unidade-em-belo-horizonte-cursos-ja-estao-disponiveis-para-inscricao/
[16:23:24] <robertmaxrees> looks like a race condition.
[16:23:39] <robertmaxrees> filter on 8003
[16:24:16] <Levin^> hmm
[16:25:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:25:24] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:25:28] <robertmaxrees> do what you want duder.
[16:25:35] <robertmaxrees> just trying to bestow some experience.
[16:25:58] <Levin^> lol
[16:26:09] <Levin^> you're helping
[18:48:04] <k0nichiwa> datatables kind of jquery plugin maybe someone knows this:
[18:48:23] <k0nichiwa> var rows = oTable.rows( { page: 'current' } );
[18:48:51] <k0nichiwa> that selects rows from visible page, rows.data() will obtain the array of data, but i dont know how to get specific row, say rows.row(k)
[18:49:07] <k0nichiwa> actually .. i think i have a workaround, i can get all the data and i can get all the nodes, which is what i needed
[18:49:23] <robertmaxrees> like, the data for a specific row?
[18:50:02] <robertmaxrees> k0nichiwa you want https://datatables.net/reference/api/row()
[18:50:03] <k0nichiwa> no i know how to get that
[18:50:12] <robertmaxrees> so you want the data for a row?
[18:50:17] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/api/row().data()
[18:50:21] <k0nichiwa> the above rows = ... allows me to select rows visible on the page
[18:50:38] <k0nichiwa> for rows visible on the page, i need the data, and the nodes, nodes being array of TR
[18:50:49] <k0nichiwa> as i said i think i have a way to do it
[18:50:56] <k0nichiwa> i can do rows.data() and rows.nodes()
[18:51:02] <k0nichiwa> i was trying rows.row(k), didnt work
[18:51:13] <k0nichiwa> so im happy, i think i have a way to get what i need
[18:51:21] <robertmaxrees> what is it that you ultimately need?
[18:51:47] <k0nichiwa> welll i have a table with some lat and lon coords, when user taps row im going to select it and make a pin on my map bounce
[18:51:54] <k0nichiwa> if you want to know the current goal
[18:52:06] <k0nichiwa> so i think ij good to go , thx
[18:52:16] <robertmaxrees> (trying to better understand the problem you're currently trying to solve, that's all:))
[18:52:19] <robertmaxrees> well then rad.
[18:52:28] <k0nichiwa> i couldnt figure out what an api-instance allowed me to do
[18:52:35] <k0nichiwa> doc on rows says it returns an api-instance
[18:52:52] <k0nichiwa> but i can copy and paste examples
[18:55:23] <k0nichiwa> copy and paste examples, thats what i learned at w3schools
[18:55:29] <robertmaxrees> D:
[18:55:32] * k0nichiwa has a phd from w3schools
[18:55:32] <robertmaxrees> that's... scary ;)
[18:55:54] <k0nichiwa> dr of scriptology
[18:58:52] <k0nichiwa> so i have an actual element object, not obtained via jquery $(...) , is there some way i can use jquery hasClass to determine if it has a class ?
[18:59:03] <k0nichiwa> dattables handded me the raw TR element
[18:59:07] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting the element?
[18:59:12] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[18:59:18] <k0nichiwa> via table.rows().nodes()
[18:59:20] <robertmaxrees> you can do $(theObject).hasClass()
[18:59:27] <k0nichiwa> thanks
[19:00:07] <k0nichiwa> i could use raw javascript but jquery is less likely to have x-browser issues
[19:00:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:00:19] <robertmaxrees> yes and no heh
[19:34:20] <jak2020> robertmaxrees!
[19:34:25] <jak2020> friends
[19:36:00] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:36:56] <jak2020> you use bootstrap?
[19:37:44] <robertmaxrees> i do.
[19:38:12] <robertmaxrees> as do the folks in ##bootstrap :)
[19:38:28] <jak2020> webdev question: 1) not exist more classes for create different buttons, styles colors?
[19:38:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:39:20] <robertmaxrees> (sorry, that question made no sense lol)
[19:41:41] <jak2020> robertmaxrees are you on bootstrap channel?
[19:42:14] <robertmaxrees> nopw
[19:42:17] <robertmaxrees> *nope...
[19:43:13] <jak2020> ok, here
[19:44:03] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:44:07] <robertmaxrees> so what are you asking?
[19:44:26] <jak2020> for buttons exist the class btn btn-info btn-warning btn-sucess <---- coloring blue, gray, green, orange... but i want more colors, how to do?  without styling... bootstrap havent more classes? and ot exist other framework?
[19:44:44] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to change what those colors are?
[19:45:02] <jak2020> mmm not like change
[19:45:04] <jak2020> i want more
[19:45:07] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[19:45:11] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:45:14] <jak2020> but not want style the button...
[19:45:35] <robertmaxrees> like, do you have buttons that aren't info, warning, success, etc?
[19:46:42] <jak2020> yes
[19:46:47] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[19:46:58] <jak2020> pink
[19:47:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:47:02] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[19:47:04] <jak2020> yellow
[19:47:09] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing color with purpose.
[19:47:49] <robertmaxrees> you want to theme bootstrap for your purposes.
[19:48:08] <jak2020> i want dislpay 7 buttons
[19:48:37] <robertmaxrees> what makes those buttons different?
[19:49:03] <jak2020> 1 print report1 other print report2 other see the detail other send a email... and so on
[19:49:23] <robertmaxrees> then what you want are primary or secondary buttons with icons.
[19:49:44] <robertmaxrees> do you also want to customize the colors of the buttons?
[19:49:57] <jak2020> yes
[19:50:00] <jak2020> like this:
[19:50:02] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/
[19:50:11] <robertmaxrees> then you want to follow this guide
[19:50:41] <robertmaxrees> the idea is that you don't want to customize the buttons - you want to change your theme colors to keep things consistent.
[19:54:23] <jak2020> robertmaxrees: https://mdbootstrap.com/components/buttons/
[19:54:31] <jak2020> not know if is a good choise
[19:55:08] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:55:33] <robertmaxrees> i give up lol
[19:55:49] <jak2020> give? mmmmm
[19:55:52] <jak2020> recommend me use?
[19:55:56] <robertmaxrees> ,,,
[19:56:05] <robertmaxrees> i linked you to the documentation to do this yourself.
[19:56:14] <robertmaxrees> why'd you ignore that?
[19:56:51] <jak2020> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/ <--- this?
[19:56:56] <robertmaxrees> yes
[19:58:00] <jak2020> mmm not ignored
[19:58:09] <jak2020> i read,
[19:58:19] <robertmaxrees> so then use it?
[20:00:39] <jak2020> ok
[20:01:00] <jak2020> other question: how to create a <select> <option>    <- the options simulate buttons ?
[20:01:17] <robertmaxrees> you want a select menu whose options are buttons?
[20:02:27] <jak2020> yes
[20:02:47] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/
[20:02:52] <robertmaxrees> combine this with buttons.
[20:02:55] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[20:03:37] <jak2020> ok, thanks
[20:04:03] <jak2020> robertmaxrees materialize is an option?
[20:04:24] <robertmaxrees> that's another option...
[20:05:16] <robertmaxrees> but that's going to come with its own ways of doing thingsd.
[20:05:40] <robertmaxrees> *things.  you don't want to fight your frameworks/libraries.
[20:08:38] <jak2020> :)
[20:24:08] <k0nichiwa> ui radio checkbox widget, know how to stop propagation ?  clicking it is causing a click event on underlying control
[20:24:34] <k0nichiwa> if i dont make the input checkbox into a jquery chckbox, putting event.stopPropagation() in the click  handler works
[20:24:51] <k0nichiwa> but if i make it a jqiuery checkbox, it no longer works and i get a click on the underlying control
[20:26:12] <Nirvash> k0nichiwa — Have you already tried preventDefault()? https://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[20:29:03] <k0nichiwa> yeah
[20:29:12] <k0nichiwa> what im going to try now is caputre the click in the underlying span
[20:29:19] <k0nichiwa> if i kill propagation there im good
[20:32:07] <k0nichiwa> that seems to work .. now if i can just fix the styling
[20:32:30] <k0nichiwa> ive found if u have a problem with a widget its likely easiest if possible to modify its container
[20:33:05] <k0nichiwa> uhm no, not prevent default, i did stop propagation but doing it in the containing span workec
[20:44:59] <k0nichiwa> hm cant get it to work it slike it wont change state, but reguilar html checkbox is ok (comment out the .radichckebox() line )
[20:45:13] <k0nichiwa> i guess ill just try to copy n paste some css to make the reuglar checkbox look better
