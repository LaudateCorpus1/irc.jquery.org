[00:34:15] <GanzAndere> https://github.com/caffeinalab/siriwavejs I am trying to use this here at: https://dev.psychedelicsdaily.com/radio/ - It's not displaying. I'm not sure why, I think I'm doing everything correctly
[00:35:26] <GanzAndere> The canvas loads, but doesn't display anything.
[00:36:45] <GanzAndere> https://paste2.org/V9jdvtGZ <- console.log
[00:36:56] <GanzAndere> It's there. object exists. I can fire the SW.start() function
[00:37:01] <GanzAndere> It just won't display anything.
[00:39:37] <GanzAndere> Canvas loads in firefox/chrome. no animation. :/
[08:15:44] <juinn> any one about please?
[08:17:00] <juinn> http://jsfiddle.net/edfveb82/   why when selecting a month or year is the datepicker hiding please?
[08:17:51] <MikeD_> juinn: mouseleave?
[08:18:20] <juinn> yes i want the datepicker to hide on mouseleave...but not when your trying to select month or year
[08:19:22] <MikeD_> well in order to have those drop-downs display in front of everything else, including the frame of the datepicker, they're in <body> and positioned to look like they're dropped-down
[08:19:38] <MikeD_> so when you mouse onto the dropdown, you're leaving the datepicker
[08:19:54] <juinn> i see....
[08:20:39] <juinn> how can i stop from hiding though? =/
[08:24:50] <juinn> something like this?
[08:24:50] <juinn> http://jsfiddle.net/edfveb82/1/
[08:24:56] <juinn> although its not working
[08:27:30] <MikeD_> the dropdown has a class, you could check for that class and NOT hide
[08:27:57] <MikeD_> or you can abandon the mouseleave event
[08:28:11] <MikeD_> people still don't get that
[08:28:39] <juinn> MikeD_: thats what im trying to do here http://jsfiddle.net/edfveb82/2/
[08:49:51] <MikeD_> that's not conditional though, so every time you do any of those actions/events, you stop the default?
[08:50:04] <MikeD_> wait, i didn't read the second param
[09:04:28] <SpecialTech> would there be an easy way to ask c-level positions what their website stack is? I feel like they wouldn't understand the term "stack".
[09:05:19] <MikeD_> would you expect them to know the tools their people are using in the first place?
[09:05:47] <SpecialTech> Not too detailed, but enough to know how there website works a bi
[09:06:03] <SpecialTech> their*
[09:06:51] <MikeD_> probably easiest to name 2-3 common stack configurations as options to provide context and see what they say
[09:07:44] <SpecialTech> That's true.
[09:07:48] <SpecialTech> Thanks.
[09:25:22] <hd1> https://news.d8u.us/ trying to toggle divs on here, between '#menu1' and '#home', toggling #home woks, #menu1 does not -- anyone have a moment to debug?
[10:05:24] <MikeD_> hd1: .show is more important than display: none?
[10:05:37] <MikeD_> i wouldn't expect that to be true, but I never use !important
[10:07:16] <hd1> huh?
[10:08:30] <MikeD_> idk now, home changed to menu2
[10:09:13] <hd1> yes
[10:09:48] <MikeD_> fwiw #inputEmail is supposed to be unique for the entire DOM
[10:10:50] <MikeD_> line 8:  you missed the e in a#xisting
[10:12:34] <hd1> fixed
[10:14:17] <MikeD_> bootstrap is leaving .show class on your display:none element
[10:14:53] <MikeD_> if you open the dev tools and disable the .show rule for display: block !important; you'll see this code functions as intended
[10:16:47] <taplar> seems like bootstrap would have built in logic for the tabs, instead of having to change the visibility manually like that
[10:16:57] <MikeD_> fwiw - using placeholder text instead of a label is a "style choice" that is arguably wrong.
[10:17:14] <taplar> smells like possibly a configuration issue
[10:17:17] <MikeD_> but i'm not going to fight that fight  :)
[10:17:49] <taplar> http://twitterbootstrap.org/twitter-bootstrap-tabs-example/
[10:36:42] <hd1> taplar: am looking at that
[10:41:38] <juinn> MikeD_: what you think? http://jsfiddle.net/vL6ros5n/
[10:42:02] <juinn> when month or year select then it doesn;t close :)
[10:42:26] <MikeD_> it's still not right
[10:42:51] <juinn> what you mean? =/
[10:43:25] <MikeD_> it still closes before I'm finished using it
[10:43:59] <MikeD_> if I mouse out of the dropdown, the whole thing goes away
[10:45:29] <MikeD_> we solved this problem by registering a click handler on document to close the calendar if the thing you are clicking isn't a child of a calendar
[10:46:26] <MikeD_> because some people with spazzy mouse skills will sometimes mouse out of the calendar but they haven't actually selected a date.. and it's user-abusive to assume their dexterity issues are a signal they're done with the contorl
[10:46:33] <MikeD_> control
[10:46:45] <vinxz> Hi all guys, is there a way to do reverse dns with jquery?
[10:47:11] <taplar> no
[10:47:31] <taplar> jQuery is for manipulating the dom, not anything network related
[10:47:59] <MikeD_> does that include fetch vs ajax ?
[10:48:21] <taplar> that's javascript related
[10:48:29] <taplar> dns isn't inherently js related
[10:49:18] <GanzAndere> Is there a way to chain .addClass and .fadeIn ?
[10:49:30] <MikeD_> that said, if vinxz reframes the question as "can i ask a webservice for reverse dns results ... using jquery" then yes.
[10:49:37] <GanzAndere> https://bpaste.net/show/7a8f3bb16454 <- comes in very abruptly when I add/remoe class. I want to fade this class in. Any idea?
[10:49:50] <taplar> sure
[10:49:55] <taplar> but that's not what he asked, :P
[10:50:00] <GanzAndere> no me
[10:50:02] <GanzAndere> i asked it :D
[10:50:05] <GanzAndere> good morning
[10:50:30] <taplar> trying to find the doc but i thought addClass returned the element it acted upon
[10:50:36] <MikeD_> taplar: understood.  We're devs, so being sticklers for word usage is part of the territory
[10:50:56] <GanzAndere> taplar, right. I'm just curious to know mylogic is unsound and how to make it sound
[10:50:57] <taplar> ya, addClass returns the element it acted upon.  so addClass(blah).fadeIn() should work
[10:51:06] <MikeD_> doesn't fadein have a callback you can use for the addClass when fadein is done?
[10:51:15] <GanzAndere> taplar, well it works but the side effect is odd
[10:51:23] <GanzAndere> taplar, let me show case it
[10:52:33] <vinxz> MikeD_: I can't include any external service in my code
[10:52:41] <GanzAndere> taplar, https://dev.psychedelicsdaily.com/radio/
[10:53:02] <GanzAndere> taplar, when the music is not plaing, I want to fadeOut the background css animated gradient
[10:53:12] <MikeD_> vinxz: then you're back to the unqualified (and definitive) "no."
[10:53:17] <GanzAndere> I can't seem to figure out how to do this. It just comes in abruplyt since we add class and remove class
[10:53:34] <taplar> what does the class do?
[10:53:40] <GanzAndere> sicne you add class, browser just attaches it to the element, and then fades it in, which means it will abruptly display first, then try to fadein
[10:53:41] <taplar> what's its definition?
[10:53:43] <GanzAndere> it's backwards.
[10:54:06] <GanzAndere> https://bpaste.net/show/6329104b8212
[10:54:07] <MikeD_> http://api.jquery.com/fadein/  use the 'complete' parameter of the fadeIn()
[10:54:08] <GanzAndere> this what class does
[10:54:36] <GanzAndere> Well, other things fade it's fine. I think the problem is that i have to not use add/remove class maybe
[10:54:53] <GanzAndere> b/c logically, since you attach a class, style takes form instantly, and then you fade it in, makes no sense
[10:54:55] <GanzAndere> it's already displayed
[10:55:10] <GanzAndere> fade in only does display the hidden element by using animation
[10:55:12] <taplar> i'm wondering if you could use css steps as part of that class to fade in and out the effect
[10:55:13] <GanzAndere> but it's already visible.
[10:55:14] <taplar> brb
[10:55:22] <GanzAndere> I'm thinking.
[10:55:27] <GanzAndere> perhaps ohhhhh
[10:55:29] <GanzAndere> hangon.
[10:55:39] <MikeD_> foo.fadeIn( 2000, function(){ foo.addClass('bar') } )
[10:55:53] <GanzAndere> How about, if event is not fired, dont' remove class, but modify class, and change the animation: pause.
[10:55:57] <GanzAndere> wait. that will do it.
[10:56:03] <GanzAndere> I just want the animation to stop, not the whole colors to go away.
[10:56:09] <GanzAndere> right, that makes more logical sense.
[10:56:12] <GanzAndere> okay. takling to myself here
[10:56:13] <GanzAndere> doh
[10:56:37] <GanzAndere> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state
[10:56:38] <GanzAndere> found it!
[10:57:25] <MikeD_> you found something, not sure that's 'it'
[11:02:15] <GanzAndere> I got it.
[11:02:25] <GanzAndere> .radioplayer {animation-play-state: paused; }
[11:03:03] <GanzAndere> function showVisuals(){ $('.psy').fadeIn(1500);$('.radioplayer').css('animation-play-state', 'running');}
[11:03:15] <GanzAndere> and paused for hideVisuals()
[11:03:20] <GanzAndere> works beautifully.
[11:03:37] <GanzAndere> https://bpaste.net/show/1d52ffa1ceda <- new code
[11:07:43] <GanzAndere> https://dev.psychedelicsdaily.com/radio/ <- live
[11:07:54] <GanzAndere> Man. That looks nice. Damn, I'm good.
[11:08:02] <GanzAndere> With your help, I mean. Otherwise I suck.
[11:08:04] <GanzAndere> :D
[11:38:40] <taplar> that was a longer step away than i though it'd be
[12:15:12] <GanzAndere> taplar, ha
[12:42:31] <relipse> It seems like $('myradio[value="No"]').prop('checked',false); is also triggering the .change() event? I thought it's not supposed to do that
[12:43:21] <taplar> i wouldn't think it would
[12:45:40] <relipse> Well something is happening because of that
[12:45:47] <relipse> And I'm getting infinite Ajax requests after that
[12:48:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4sy01nf/ nah, it doesn't
[12:56:10] <relipse> taplar, thanks for the help...
[12:56:16] <relipse> I'm not sure what is happening, back to the drawing board
[13:09:13] <relipse> Is it possible to bind an event to $('myradio[value="No"]').removeAttr('checked'); If I remove that line of code, the infinite Ajax requests stop. But if I add it back in, I get an infinite amount of Ajax requests as if the on change is getting called when I know it can't be
[13:09:56] <taplar> i look more into what is triggering that ajax
[13:10:03] <taplar> *i'd
[13:22:49] <SpecialTech> Has anybody worked with Owl Carousel in magento? Is there a way to turn off the animation from the console?
[13:23:51] * mystica555-LT attempts to fix a bug with a TRAC plugin.. using jquery, its replacing a form field with a template of text.. but its not checking if the form field has anything pre-filled, such as if you "back" then "Forward" again in your browser, and indiscriminately replaces the content.. Attempting to find a way to check first
[13:24:20] * mystica555-LT notes that i'm relatively new to JS/Jquery programming so i figure y'all might have a few good pointers/heads ups for me before I start crashing head first into some trial and error
[13:24:37] * taplar notes that conversations are usually done in normal text, not /me
[13:24:46] * mystica555-LT likes talking in the third person ;)
[13:25:04] <mystica555-LT> taplar: thanks for at least some reply however :)
[13:25:50] <taplar> so, what is the problem?
[13:26:56] <mystica555-LT> well, the problem is if you go backward and forward to the page, any text you enter, is overwritten with the template body text
[13:26:59] <mystica555-LT> in a textarea
[13:27:36] <mystica555-LT>     var tt_name = $("#field-type").val();
[13:27:42] <mystica555-LT> seems to be the code causing it to overwrite the textarea
[13:28:13] <taplar> that's getting the value of the field-type element
[13:28:13] <taplar> what's the textarea identifier?
[13:31:26] <mystica555-LT> this is a good description of the bug itself, in trac's trac (how meta..) : https://trac-hacks.org/ticket/11544
[13:31:37] <mystica555-LT> let me check the source here..
[13:32:07] <mystica555-LT>                         <textarea id="field-description" name="field_description" class="wikitext trac-resizable" rows="10" cols="68">
[13:32:07] <mystica555-LT> </textarea>
[13:32:36] <taplar> wait, so that track plugin is doing the replacement, not your jquery logic?
[13:32:47] <mystica555-LT> i'm trying to fix -their- jquery logic
[13:32:56] <taplar> gotcha
[13:33:14] <taplar> ok, so, some where they are doing someting with $('#field-description')
[13:33:22] <mystica555-LT> its a plugin im trying to use internally here for our own group's TRAC and i need it to work to the point i won't be shooting my own hand off after being angry at it
[13:33:22] <mystica555-LT> ;)
[13:33:51] <taplar> have you found the part that is doing the value change to that element?
[13:34:36] <mystica555-LT> im not quite sure what im looking for so i breakpointed every bit in their script that had a .val ; and that line i pasted first is the one that after it passes, the field changes..
[13:34:50] <taplar> thought i should ask, is this a free plugin or are you paying them for support?
[13:34:52] <mystica555-LT> but i may not be breakpointing it at the right places..
[13:34:54] <mystica555-LT> it is free
[13:35:06] <mystica555-LT> and hasnt been really touched in a few years; a few small fixes on their end
[13:35:11] <mystica555-LT> but for other bugs
[13:35:15] <taplar> k
[13:35:36] <mystica555-LT> so im trying to i guess, figure out where i need to look to properly affect a fix
[13:35:46] <taplar> so yeah first thing to do would be to track down where the code is making the change
[13:39:41] <robertmaxrees> i gotta find a new mouse for work.  hrmmm.
[13:39:49] <mystica555-LT> https://snag.gy/r8J37M.jpg  https://bpaste.net/show/0b24dfbcb97f
[13:39:54] <mystica555-LT> this is actually the bit that makes it change
[13:40:03] <mystica555-LT> after breakpointing more
[13:40:30] <taplar> i like my microsoft mouse with the 5 buttons
[13:40:39] <mystica555-LT> the descrption is what gets re-filled into the textarea
[13:41:23] <taplar> ok, what makes reapplyTemplate true?
[13:43:26] <taplar> because ultimately what you're going to want to do, from my guessing, is check if the field has the default value that the textarea would normally have.  if it doesn't, then you wouldn't do that logic
[13:45:54] <mystica555-LT> im wanting to know if it has "any" value
[13:46:27] <taplar> so you only want it to put the default if the value is blank then?
[13:46:42] <mystica555-LT> because the concept here is that if I add my own text to this template of 'phenomenon / description / recommendation' (to be changed to other words in any new templates made) and then my own text gets wiped out
[13:46:46] <mystica555-LT> correct
[13:46:58] <taplar> so that's your conditional
[13:47:08] <mystica555-LT>   var reapplyTemplate = result["warning"] != "1" && !preview;
[13:47:15] <mystica555-LT> is what sets the reapplytemplate bit
[13:48:31] <taplar> && (reference to the element).value.trim() === "";
[13:48:38] <mystica555-LT> ok lets try that
[13:53:17] <SpecialTech> So I'm using owl.trigger('stop.owl.autoplay'); in order to turn off my own carousel, it's targeting the correct element, but it's still allowing the animation. Any thoughts?
[13:57:45] <mystica555-LT> ok so when you say reference, and the textarea is instantiated with " <textarea id="field-description" name="field_description" is it the id or the name?
[13:57:50] <mystica555-LT> or am i missing the concept
[13:58:28] <taplar> a reference is just the dom reference to it, regardless of how you get it
[13:58:52] <taplar> you could look it up with js or through jQuery, or that plugin may already have a reference to it.  in whatever manner, you just need a reference to it
[14:00:12] <mystica555-LT> hmm. im definitely not quite certain on the concept of 'reference' then in js .. (very very new to js programming; im a entry level C / midlevel php / entry level python coder .. )
[14:00:21] <mystica555-LT> (know bash like the back of my hand too)
[14:01:00] <taplar> you know about pointers in C?
[14:02:00] <taplar> though maybe that's past intro level
[14:02:45] <taplar> are you familiar with what the DOM is?
[14:03:40] <mystica555-LT> i do know pointers
[14:03:47] <mystica555-LT> the DOM i am sort of familiar with
[14:04:03] <mystica555-LT> $( "#myDiv" ).css( "border", "3px solid red" ); being a api.juery.com example
[14:04:14] <taplar> ok, so a reference is sorta similar to a pointer
[14:04:26] <mystica555-LT> so I presume I should try $ "#field-description").   due to the id=field-description
[14:04:38] <mystica555-LT> so I presume I should try $( "#field-description" ).   due to the id=field-description
[14:04:40] <taplar> your page when it is loaded gets parsed and creates the DOM that the browser uses to render the page
[14:05:06] <taplar> you could do that, sure
[14:05:24] <taplar> if you go that route you'll want to use .val().trim instead of value.trim() since it is a jQuery object and not a basic Element
[14:05:32] <taplar> .val().trim()
[14:06:51] <taplar> though I would look at the existing logic to see how it finds the element to change the value of it
[14:07:00] <taplar> because it may be doing something more dynamic than relying on the element to have that particular id
[14:07:21] <taplar> you'll probably want to emulate however they are getting their reference
[14:08:01] <taplar> "fixing the problem i can see" instead of looking at the larger picture is a great way to bite you in the ass later
[14:09:05] <mystica555-LT> hmm
[14:09:56] <mystica555-LT> indeed, but when this is my literal second or third attempt at mucking with javascript (a previous one was integrating a credit card validation thing into a website input field) im attempting baby steps to even understand what is going on at the middle level, if not below, or above..
[14:10:36] <taplar> i'm just giving you a warning i feel i should.  it's up to you what you actually do, ;)
[14:11:16] <taplar> imo, no one who ever knew what they were talking about has ever said development is easy
[14:11:42] <taplar> r/easy/simple
[14:14:03] <mystica555-LT>       var reapplyTemplate = result["warning"] != "1" && !preview && $("#field-description").val().trim() === "";
[14:14:11] <mystica555-LT> seems to have fixed it "so far"
[14:14:28] <taplar> sweet
[14:14:39] <mystica555-LT> taplar: i'm just attempting to go at it the way i learned php: give myself a problem, fix it; learn more as i give myself more problems to fix
[14:15:02] <taplar> sure
[14:15:15] <mystica555-LT> i'll try and figure out more about how their own code selects things
[14:15:19] <taplar> however in this case you are working with an exsting code base
[14:15:22] <mystica555-LT> yeah
[14:15:29] <mystica555-LT> so its a bit opaque to me still
[14:15:32] <taplar> which may already have things you can leverage, instead of reinventing
[14:15:45] <taplar> which is part of my point about looking around and what/how it is doing things
[14:18:49] <taplar> in the least though, you might put the fix you found in that ticket you linked earlier and see if anyone responds with a more preferred alteration.
[14:19:20] <taplar> if no one responds, *shrug*, but also anyone else that might have that issue also has a pointer to a potential fix, :)
[14:20:10] <jak2000> hi all
[14:20:22] <jak2000> a plugin for display a calendar?
[14:20:56] <taplar> google has one i believe
[14:21:47] <mystica555-LT> "(02:21:16 PM) danielk: Emacs is a good OS. The only thing it lacks is a good text editor."
[14:21:57] <mystica555-LT> says a vim user ;)
[14:21:57] <robertmaxrees> oooooooooold joke hahahhaa
[14:23:08] <mystica555-LT> (02:21:29 PM) danielk: ....but then, I heard that Emacs has a vim extension.
[14:23:13] <mystica555-LT> i didnt see that lol

[14:23:51] <mystica555-LT> lol
[14:24:57] <jak2000> taplar... wich you use?
[14:26:59] <taplar> https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed
[14:27:12] <taplar> with options.  we embed one in one of our applications in an iframe
[14:27:12] <taplar> super simple
[14:27:54] <jak2000> can we add events per day hour?
[14:29:01] <taplar> probably not, without some how pointing it to a private calendar you'd have to have the users logged in to be able to see.  unless they have a way to do that with making public calendars, *shrug*
[14:29:06] <taplar> dunno
[14:32:30] <jak2000> ok
[14:32:33] <jak2000> thanks
[14:33:18] <ckb> hi guys. When inserting HTML into the DOM, is there a way I can trigger a function after all images are loaded? I know on initial page load $(“window”).on(‘load’, …) works, but wasn’t sure about inserted elements
[14:37:08] <taplar> you can put on load bindings to the images
[14:38:24] <taplar> so potentially what you could do is create a deferred for each image
[14:38:46] <taplar> bind an on load handler for each image, and resolve its deferred when it happens
[14:38:59] <taplar> then you can do a $.when on all the deferreds and do logic once they all have resolved
[14:39:42] <mystica555-LT> taplar: and see, ive come across my first bug on the bugfix ;)  There is other logic that will totally replace the content of the textarea when you change the type of the ticket..
[14:39:51] <mystica555-LT> which no longer fires because its checking that the field is blank
[14:39:54] * mystica555-LT looks further
[14:40:10] <taplar> :D
[14:40:15] <mystica555-LT> iterative learning i call this
[14:40:52] <mystica555-LT> but hey, adding this to our companywide TRAC instance is something i have a deadline of the end-of-month; if i get it sooner rather than later, yay
[14:40:54] <taplar> just be careful not to get sucked into band-aid programming
[14:41:26] <mystica555-LT> i don't think i will be; my main job here is security, and one of the requirements was to make a security report template ; so i figure this is the way to do it to fit within our current ticketing process
[14:41:36] <mystica555-LT> and im attempting to just fix it to that end
[14:42:17] <mystica555-LT> (first real task of this new job of mine; the process of figuring out how to even get the development environment up for the trac server was very instructive)

[15:43:01] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:57:06] <Woet> that plane doesnt actually exist yet
[15:57:39] <taplar> hmm?
[16:00:28] <taplar> now i'm thinking of making one with something about getting beaten with the mile high club
[16:00:56] <Woet> its a 737MAX
[16:00:59] <Woet> they havent been delivered yet
[16:01:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:01:34] <taplar> not really the point though
[16:01:35] <robertmaxrees> kind of orthogonal to the jokje
[16:02:00] <Woet> never said it was the point
[16:02:15] <robertmaxrees> heh'
[16:02:32] <Woet> i just wish the amount of united material and news posts was the same as that plane
[16:02:34] <Woet> non-existent.
[16:02:35] <taplar> you affiliated with boeing?
[16:02:43] <Woet> no
[16:02:49] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:03:20] <taplar> that the material didn't exist, or that the incident didn't exist?
[16:03:57] <Woet> the material, its blown way out of proportion.
[16:04:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree.  I'd agree there's a lot of misinformation about what actually transpired and the reason behind it.
[16:04:51] <taplar> lol, in the interest of not polluting the room, you're free to your opinion
[16:05:32] <Woet> in the end, all you need to know: if a cop tells you to move, move.
[16:05:45] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:06:00] <taplar> again, you're free to your opinion
[16:06:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:06:09] <Woet> im aware, thanks
[16:06:14] <mouse> the fact that there is a subset of society that thinks bashing someone's head against an armrest because they don't want to obey an instruction that is contrary to everything in life
[16:06:19] <mouse> scares me
[16:06:44] <Woet> mouse: so I can live in your house?
[16:06:50] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'ma have to agree that we should probably drop the topic.
[16:06:53] <mouse> the fuck does that mean woet
[16:06:59] <robertmaxrees> since it's really emotionally charged.
[16:07:02] <Woet> mouse: how are you gonna get me out of your house?
[16:07:05] <robertmaxrees> hey alright - drop it please.
[16:07:10] <mouse> you didn't pay to get in my house
[16:07:47] <Woet> payment doesn't entitle you to guaranteed access.
[16:07:52] <robertmaxrees> aaand last warning.
[16:07:53] <robertmaxrees> please.
[16:08:21] <mouse> seems like we should re-accomodate woet
[16:08:26] <mouse> from this channel
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> moving on then - how's everybody's friday?
[16:11:00] <jak2000> any idea: the user click on a link pointing to a mp3, how to play it?
[16:11:18] <robertmaxrees> https://kolber.github.io/audiojs/
[16:11:20] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> quick google searches ;)
[16:11:44] <taplar> pretty good for a friday
[16:12:01] <taplar> i'm happy that i got through a couple complicated cards this week
[16:12:11] <robertmaxrees> very nice.
[16:12:20] <robertmaxrees> anything particularly noteworthy?
[16:12:51] <SpecialTech> Woot, I have like 10 cards i'm working on today :(
[16:12:52] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: yes
[16:12:55] <jak2000> thanks
[16:13:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees your age is? 22 years?
[16:13:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:13:16] <robertmaxrees> ... nope.
[16:13:18] <SpecialTech> He's trying to hit on you
[16:13:27] <SpecialTech> might as well ask a/s/l
[16:13:28] <taplar> not sure that i can say much about it at this point.  just a new service with lots of validation that i was trying to get right, and other people kept asking me questions while i was trying to focus and driving me crazy, lol
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> taplar those are the worst!
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> when people keep bugging you i mean.
[16:13:48] <SpecialTech> i get those type of people everyday
[16:13:49] <SpecialTech> :(
[16:14:04] <jak2000> taplar have 31 years you? more young?
[16:14:12] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 why are you asking for people's age?
[16:14:20] <robertmaxrees> also: lol that he thinks i'm that much younger than tapler
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> *tapl
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> wtf you know what I mean hahahahaha
[16:14:40] <taplar> lol
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> iirc taplar is younger than I am.
[16:15:15] <taplar> nope
[16:15:16] <SpecialTech> we're all the same age in the scope of all grand things
[16:15:40] <jak2000> robertmaxrees only a question i have >40
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:15:59] <taplar> at least i think i'm older maybe from some social sites of yours i've seen
[16:16:16] <robertmaxrees> well sheeeit
[16:17:17] <taplar> but yeah, like Special said, knowledge isn't really dependent upon age
[16:17:30] <robertmaxrees> lots of things aren't imo.
[16:17:36] <SpecialTech> I read rob's blog like 2years ago
[16:17:45] <robertmaxrees> i last posted like 2 years ago.
[16:17:46] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:17:59] <SpecialTech> I know that was the last time I saw any updates lmao
[16:18:32] <taplar> there's how you know robert is younger than me.  he blogs
[16:19:02] <taplar> ^_^
[16:19:15] <SpecialTech> but youre using smileys, you can't be that much older
[16:19:16] <SpecialTech> :d
[16:19:24] <robertmaxrees> coupla years.
[16:19:35] <robertmaxrees> I just turned 30 on sunday fwiw
[16:20:00] <SpecialTech> oh wth
[16:20:07] <SpecialTech> youre only a couple years older than me
[16:20:08] <SpecialTech> haha
[16:20:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:20:18] <taplar> my mom uses smilies
[16:20:26] <SpecialTech> and youre my jquery role model lmao
[16:20:31] <robertmaxrees> pffff
[16:20:36] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[16:20:46] <robertmaxrees> what's funny is how rarely I've been using jquery lately.
[16:21:07] <SpecialTech> I mean, between you, taplar, and shoky, you've taught me the most hah
[16:21:26] <SpecialTech> what have you been using lately?
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> I've been in CSS land mostly.  And node.
[16:21:40] <SpecialTech> I've been learning a lot of angular/react lately, still struggling, but yea
[16:21:53] <taplar> those two informed me of a lot, so me to you is just transference, or whatever
[16:22:22] <SpecialTech> I started in IRC with CSS
[16:22:35] <SpecialTech> used to give a lot of my time there along side jedimind lol
[16:22:47] <robertmaxrees> aka drej
[16:22:51] <SpecialTech> si
[16:22:53] <SpecialTech> ;d
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> cool dude
[16:23:57] <taplar> i haven't seen decx around as much in a while
[16:24:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  he's been floating.
[16:24:16] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell's been wicked busy last I checked.
[16:24:27] <SpecialTech> do you know massdebates?
[16:24:54] <taplar> know of him
[16:25:11] <SpecialTech> thats another cool dude willing to expand others knowledge haha
[16:25:32] <robertmaxrees> i remember mass
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> he's still around sometimes afaik
[16:25:48] <SpecialTech> if you need wp help, he's a good person to reach out too in #wordpress
[16:26:31] <SpecialTech> he's also really active in the zurb foundation community
[16:26:36] <taplar> i've yet to have to work on a wordpress site.  and i think i'm happy about that.
[16:27:31] <SpecialTech> I just think it's easy money for an easy job depending on the requirements.
[16:28:00] <SpecialTech> i never accept anything that's outside of my scope of do-able.
[16:28:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you're just churning out theme installs, it's an OK gig.
[16:31:30] <Jeron> Not sure if I should post my question or here looking for help? Anyone here that can help with some basic code?
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> Jeron as long as it's jquery, we can help :)
[16:32:12] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service for code and ask away!
[16:33:13] <SpecialTech> robert have you used owl carousel by any chance?
[16:33:30] <SpecialTech> its a magento based extension
[16:33:37] <robertmaxrees> it's actually not magento.
[16:33:46] <robertmaxrees> there's a magento plugin for it.
[16:33:51] <SpecialTech> I thought it was, thats mostly where I've seen it haha
[16:34:00] <robertmaxrees> we use the jquery plugin version here.
[16:34:17] <SpecialTech> is there a global stop autoplay function I can call from the console?
[16:35:07] <SpecialTech> I've tried to trigger the 'stop.owl.autoplay' function, and it won't stop
[16:35:35] <robertmaxrees> how did you trigger it?
[16:35:36] <SpecialTech> and then when I search in the code base for it, it seems like it's missing for that specific version.
[16:35:48] <robertmaxrees> because i don't think that's a function.
[16:36:22] <SpecialTech>     owl.trigger('stop.owl.autoplay');
[16:36:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[16:36:32] <robertmaxrees> that's an event.
[16:36:38] <Jeron> :) Thank you, I have 6 Images and a paragraph below them, I would like when I click on one of the images, the content of the paragraph below will change. I have given each image an Id and the paragraph.
[16:36:42] <robertmaxrees> and you're trying to trigger that event, which isn't what you want.
[16:36:58] <robertmaxrees> Jeron great!  show us your html at https://jsfiddle.net/
[16:37:05] <robertmaxrees> and whatever js you';ve tried.
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> just enter the html, js, and css into their respective boxes and hit "save" up top.
[16:38:21] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTech i'm not seeing any methods for doing what you wnat.
[16:38:42] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:38:45] <robertmaxrees> https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/demos/autoplay.html
[16:38:52] <robertmaxrees> well shoot!  i was wrong.
[16:40:53] <SpecialTech> hahaha
[16:40:59] <SpecialTech> I taught you something today ;D
[16:41:18] <SpecialTech> yea I definitely think this is an outdated version
[16:41:26] <SpecialTech> because I don't see any stop in this version
[16:41:29] <Jeron> Sorry to make it complicated. I'm using wordpress with Visual Composer, so I can't paste the html I have. and the jquery that I do have https://jsfiddle.net/87jq2kp9/ is very minimum.
[16:41:42] <SpecialTech> and the sad thing is, the comments were stripped.
[16:41:47] <SpecialTech> so i'll never know
[16:42:58] <SpecialTech> Jeron that's javascript, and you'll need to structure the html, one tip is copy and pasting the element from console to fiddle.
[16:43:42] <Jeron> xD well I feel noobish, ok I'll structure it real quick
[16:43:45] <Jeron> ty
[16:51:16] <Jeron> Ok https://jsfiddle.net/87jq2kp9/1/
[16:51:51] <robertmaxrees> alright, so first off your html is back.
[16:52:08] <robertmaxrees> *bad
[16:52:13] <robertmaxrees> you're missing some quotes.
[16:52:30] <robertmaxrees> they should all be src="blank.html" id="about1"
[16:52:36] <robertmaxrees> etc
[16:52:57] <robertmaxrees> 2nd, you should really pop in all the stuff you wanna show into the page as well and hide it with CSS.
[16:54:40] <Jeron> Ok so create the paragraphs and display:none them?
[16:54:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a class called 'hide'
[16:55:01] <robertmaxrees> that sets display: none for you.
[16:56:29] <robertmaxrees> now, you need a way to tie each image to each paragraph, right?
[16:57:50] <Jeron> yes
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink the html in that case.
[16:58:17] <Jeron> well I'm not using this, I'm using wordpress
[16:58:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:58:35] <robertmaxrees> can't you create custom markup?
[16:58:49] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[16:59:48] <relipse> test
[17:04:27] <Jeron> Sorry rob, Don't mean to make it difficult. I can create a custom markup on it yes, but I'm using a Drag and drop page builder for WordPress.
[17:05:32] <robertmaxrees> Jeron so lemme back up - are you like completely new to jquery?
[18:29:39] <taplar> these cards are crabs
[18:32:50] <taplar> peanut and crab jokes.  highly allergic sense of humor
[18:58:42] <mystica555-LT> tapout: i had a crabcake sandwich for lunch ( if you are in vabeach and like foodtrucks, https://www.captncrabby.com/ )
[18:58:50] <mystica555-LT> taplar is gone.
[18:58:51] <mystica555-LT> :(
[18:58:56] <mystica555-LT> sorry
[20:14:12] <apple> hello
[23:45:33] <Moondhum> Hello, I am trying to show/hide content when respective button is pressed https://jsfiddle.net/t8fqzknt/20/ please help.
