[00:06:28] <HAPPYFUNBALL> is it possible to do a fuzzy match with $.parents()?
[00:14:44] <HAPPYFUNBALL> hm
[01:43:35] <Ayub19> why do I get a timeout error when returning jsonp response from server ?
[04:09:33] <Kheeper> hello fellows ... can any of you tell me why this isn't working and explain what am I doing wrong - http://pastebin.com/jtudTmX2
[04:11:59] <Kheeper> is saying ... TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating '$('#errors').show_errors ({
[04:15:37] <Kartagis> Kheeper: for  one, try $(document).ready(function () { instead of $(document).ready (function () {
[04:17:31] <Jattenalle> is the errors.js file even loaded? you have no checks, at all
[04:18:07] <Kheeper> it should be
[04:18:32] <Kheeper> yes it is
[04:18:53] <Jattenalle> it's not loaded synchronously on most browsers
[04:18:58] <Jattenalle> so you need a way to check when it's done
[04:19:03] <Jattenalle> so say google
[04:19:31] <Jattenalle> ie: it will get added as a src to the document, and the browser might fetch it in a different thread while execution continues
[04:19:36] <Jattenalle> make sure it's loaded BEFORE you try to call it
[04:20:11] <Kheeper> okie give me second to tested
[04:20:58] <Jattenalle> a simple console print at top of your errors.js, and another one just before the function call should do the trick
[04:21:24] <Kheeper> top you right is loaded after calling the function
[04:21:33] <Kheeper> *yop
[04:21:42] <Jattenalle> there ya go :)
[04:21:45] <Kheeper> so how do I fix that?
[04:21:50] <Kheeper> :D
[04:22:04] <Jattenalle> you need to stop the entire site and wait for it to be done loading
[04:23:16] <Kheeper> hmm loading ... wheel always wonder why others use them :D (just making fun)
[04:23:21] <Jattenalle> or you could just do what any sane person does, and include the script the normal way
[04:23:26] <Jattenalle> :P
[04:23:43] <Kheeper> I'm not normal person :D
[04:23:55] <Kheeper> I'm .... crazyyyyyyy
[04:25:29] <Jattenalle> well a simple setTimeout(100, myCheckFunc); function myCheckFunc(){ if(!error_function){ setTimeout(100, myCheckFunc); }else{ someFancyFlag = true; } }
[04:25:33] <Jattenalle> something like that at least
[04:25:43] <Jattenalle> typing code on a single line in IRC is hell
[04:25:43] <Jattenalle> :P
[04:26:07] <Kheeper> can imagine that but hey some people do that in code :D
[04:26:22] <Jattenalle> or you can just make it directly call initializeAllMyStuff() instead of setting someFancyFlag
[04:26:37] <Jattenalle> #BestVariableNames2014
[04:27:12] <Jattenalle> anyhow, gotta run, good luck!
[04:27:18] <Kheeper> okie thanks men ...
[04:34:03] <Kheeper> okie just add $(window).load() before calling the function
[05:41:43] <CssNoob> Good evening guys
[05:42:45] <SirLagz> evening
[05:42:56] <arthurvr> hi guys!
[05:43:20] <CssNoob> :|
[05:46:52] <SirLagz> 988 line .js file...maybe I should start splitting it up lol
[05:49:21] <arthurvr> You shouldn't start splitting up files when they become to long. You should do it from start man
[05:49:31] <arthurvr> lol :-)
[05:50:31] <SirLagz> arthurvr: obviously :P
[05:55:31] <SirLagz> I'm doing a post to a page, at times this page will do a redirect. Is there a way that I can catch this redirect in $.post() ?
[06:52:00] <BRashid> I am looking for a way to make a few numbers appear like on the matrix. So if I want to get 100 as an output it first goes through let's say 0-9 for each number before it gets 100. Is there a way to do this?
[07:19:18] <pedda> hi there
[07:20:08] <pedda> i'm struggeling with some event binding
[07:27:14] <Cydrobolt> hi
[07:27:28] <Cydrobolt> im getting this error when I use bootstrap's dropdown
[07:27:30] <Cydrobolt> 3jquery.min.js:5 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createDocumentFragment' of null
[07:27:52] <Cydrobolt> every time I hover over the dropdown, this error occurs
[07:41:02] <Alina-malina> I cant make a click inside each()  loop :-/ http://paste.pound-python.org/show/b20hBORWpTPlPrvLgf3h/   how to make a click happen without onclick event inside each loop?
[07:41:48] <mr_Shrimp_> Which jquery spliter plugin is among the most mature?
[07:42:47] <AlexR> Alina-malina: the code you're showing isn't doing anything about a click event, what do you mean you can't make a click inside an each loop?
[07:42:56] <Alina-malina> oh just a moment please
[07:43:03] <Alina-malina> http://paste.pound-python.org/show/BCmLKU5EUFoiotOLBgdk/  here it is
[07:44:09] <Alina-malina> when i write a separate function to click on clickable, it doesnt react on anything
[07:45:18] <Alina-malina> and this is the function to make a click: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ag6L9f8QAFxiwxZr77pY/
[07:47:26] <AlexR> Alina-malina: you're using the wrong selector on your .on() event.  The selector you're using is for ids (#), not classes (.).  Try $(".clickable")
[07:48:44] <pedda> if a plugin adds some magic on "change" to an element and i would like to add some moren magic to the same element on "change" too, how can i achieve this?
[07:48:51] <Alina-malina> AlexR, no still same :-
[07:51:50] <Alina-malina> AlexR, maybe it is inside each loop thats why i cant use click event against that class of clickable?
[07:55:21] <AlexR> What do you mean it's inside each loop?  What you've shown me is two completely separate pieces of code. Is that not how it actually is?
[07:55:45] <axilla> you shouldn't be using ID's for stuff like removeable alina
[07:55:52] <axilla> ID's should be unique
[07:55:56] <axilla> there should be only 1 id on a page
[07:55:58] <axilla> use classes
[07:55:59] <Alina-malina> i am using classes now
[07:56:01] <axilla> ok
[07:56:08] <Alina-malina> but it doent work
[07:56:10] <axilla> can you update your code
[07:56:13] <AlexR> pedda, those events don't override each other.  You can just add additional ones without worry of overriding old ones
[07:56:15] <Alina-malina> ok jst a moment
[07:57:50] <pedda> AlexR i'm struggeling in the context of validating a "fake file upload field", the validation happens on change, so does the setting of value in my fake field
[07:58:20] <AlexR> Can you show some code?  jsfiddle.net
[07:58:21] <pedda> vithout validation, this approach works as expected: http://codepen.io/claviska/pen/vAgmd
[07:58:35] <Alina-malina> axilla, http://paste.pound-python.org/show/lPuIekVURVg3RTkcKOtW/
[07:59:02] <pedda> if i enable my php/ajax based validation, the value (coming from the name of selected file) doesn't work anymore @AlexR
[07:59:07] <AlexR> Alina-malina: the time at which you are binding your click events -- those elements don't exist on the page yet
[07:59:21] <Alina-malina> hmm
[07:59:31] <AlexR> you can do a $("body").on("click", ".clickable", function(){});
[08:00:13] <AlexR> or you can bind individual items after they've been added by doing the binding within the loop after they're appended
[08:00:24] <pedda> $(document).on('change', '.btn-file :file', -> $(document).on('click', '.btn-file :file', ?
[08:00:56] <pedda> can namespacing of events help?
[08:02:10] <Alina-malina> AlexR, heh super it worked wow
[08:02:20] <Alina-malina> AlexR, thanks for your help!! very nice!!
[08:02:24] <AlexR> You're welcome
[08:02:52] <AlexR> namespacing doesn't matter too much unless you're planning to remove events and need to specify what event to remove
[08:03:01] <pedda> ah .. kk
[08:04:26] <pedda> what doesn't work in the provided example is actually the triggering of fileselect event, as if the on('change') behaviour related to validation would prevent the triggering of on('fileselect') in the shown example
[08:04:59] <mr_Shrimp_> When was the first version of jQuery released?
[08:05:52] <Masent> Hi Guys!!
[08:06:04] <Masent> I'm getting an error in this script :::: var result = JSON.parse(iframeContents);
[08:06:17] <Masent> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 3 column 1 of the JSON data
[08:06:23] <Masent> someone know why?
[08:06:49] <pedda> AlexR ... i realise i have overlooked the fact that my validation unbinds all events.. as the generated js code from my plugin looks like this: jQuery(".form-applicationJob *[name*='applicationJob[job]']").unbind().on("keyup blur change", function() {
[08:06:54] <mr_Shrimp_> Masent: Can you create a pastebin?
[08:07:09] <Masent> just for that short line?
[08:07:11] <pedda> i think i can handle that issue on my own now.. shame on me
[08:07:23] <AlexR> okey doke.  good luck, let me know if you have other issues
[08:07:33] <mr_Shrimp_> Masent: I think the JSON is malformed.
[08:07:55] <Masent> how can I fix it?
[08:08:22] <mr_Shrimp_>  Is the value of ifameContents created by you?
[08:08:47] <Masent> yes
[08:08:54] <pedda> check if  iframeContents needs to be sanitized before parsing
[08:08:56] <AlexR> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=when+was+the+first+version+of+jquery+released
[08:09:30] <mr_Shrimp_> AlexR: I was hoping for year, day, minute, second.. :))
[08:10:02] <AlexR> August 26, 2006
[08:10:35] <AlexR> 12:46am eastern
[08:11:07] <mr_Shrimp_> Cool..
[08:11:27] <mr_Shrimp_> Which time zone?
[08:11:34] <AlexR> 11:10 AlexR: 12:46am eastern
[08:12:30] <AlexR> per http://blog.jquery.com/2006/08/26/jquery-10/
[08:41:25] <Masent> http://jsbin.com/livepahaya/1/edit
[08:41:38] <Masent> My issue is here
[08:42:41] <Masent> Someone can help to do pass the value of that dynamic value to my url target
[08:54:32] <Masent> http://jsbin.com/tikizapimo/1/edit
[08:55:04] <Masent> show me this :: SecurityError: The operation is insecure.
[09:08:42] <Velveeta> you can't programmatically set the value of a file input
[09:09:02] <Velveeta> otherwise, you could request any file from their system, including system files that may have secure info about the machine
[09:10:44] <Masent> what do you suggest me?
[09:24:17] <Alina-malina> AlexR, i am getting this error :-/ TypeError: e is undefined
[09:24:19] <Velveeta> why are you having to set a file input's value programmatically?
[09:24:40] <AlexR> show me code alina
[09:24:45] <blackkbot> Alina-malina you are trying to use e somewhere where it isn't defined
[09:25:06] <Velveeta> i'm guessing it's for some event listener callback... are you receiving e as a parameter to your callback function?
[09:25:13] <Alina-malina> AlexR, http://paste.pound-python.org/show/ByCHlnLQ9RnmWRtflmqG/
[09:25:43] <Velveeta> yep, there's the problem... add e to your function parameters in your callback
[09:26:35] <Alina-malina> erm
[09:26:37] <AlexR> that's not the right code... it doesn't contain any es
[09:27:00] <Velveeta> yeah, that too :D
[09:47:55] <Alina-malina> AlexR, http://paste.pound-python.org/show/E6QecQ8dO1XdKjWz3JVe/  still same error, i dont understand where it comes from
[09:48:55] <AlexR> it's not coming from that chunk of code
[09:49:00] <AlexR> you aren't looking in the right place
[11:28:24] <warehouse13> Are jQuery Template libraries very common with jquery users or are they ignored?
[11:29:08] <abortionist> bye for now
[11:49:53] <warehouse13> ok I guess it's the latter:)
[11:55:31] <AlexR> you mean for rendering common html?
[11:55:51] <AlexR> @warehouse13
[11:56:48] <warehouse13> Alexer-, yes.. like jsviews etc
[11:57:01] <AlexR> i personally have always used handlebars
[11:57:27] <warehouse13> oh I see
[11:57:28] <AlexR> it's a more functional version of mustache
[11:58:06] <warehouse13> I see.. I'll have a look at it.. thanks
[12:51:06] <HAPPYFUNBALL> hey
[12:51:18] <HAPPYFUNBALL> how efficient is a search trhough a DOM?
[12:51:40] <HAPPYFUNBALL> i feel like I do them quite a bit
[12:51:46] <HAPPYFUNBALL> and am concerned about performance
[13:39:00] <floatmastaflex> why is this bad: if ((var nextPager = $('.view').find('.pager-next a')).length >= 1)
[13:39:24] <wa5ted> hey if i have a .each looping over some elements
[13:39:34] <wa5ted> how can i get the pseudo element:before of that element
[13:39:49] <wa5ted> that element being $(this) which is defined each time the .each goes through all the elements
[13:41:22] <shoky> you can't select a pseudo element
[13:42:51] <shoky> you can manipulate a regular element (e.g. add a class to it) and then reference that in your psuedo-selector in your CSS e.g.   .someClass:before { ... }
[14:53:12] <floatmastaflex> ok, so I am using ajaxComplete to do various things. however, i'm running into a little issue with multiple ajax completions from various parts of my codebase causing problems. Is there any way to monitor for *specific* ajax completions?
[17:33:47] <pessimism> I have a form that generates a table on the same static page. I used preventDefault() to stop the submit button from refreshing the page. The problem with this is that I no longer get the input errors e.g. for input[type="url"]. How do I preserve the errors without refreshing the page?
[17:39:49] <Velveeta> we'd need an example of what you have in place to be able to help you figure out how to do that
[17:40:00] <Velveeta> can you throw together a code sample in pastebin or jsfiddle?
[17:40:06] <pessimism> Velveeta: https://ndarville.com/projects/metapoll
[17:40:07] <wa5ted> Velveeta: hey man
[17:40:12] <Velveeta> hola hola
[17:40:20] <wa5ted> pessimism: wee need code exposure
[17:40:24] <wa5ted> so we can play around
[17:40:26] <Velveeta> that's not a code sample
[17:41:41] <pessimism> just wanted to give it a shot
[17:41:43] <pessimism> ohwell, later
[17:41:50] <Velveeta> jesus
[17:41:55] <Velveeta> how fucking lazy can you be
[17:45:08] <Velveeta> and i actually found the answer to his problem too
[17:45:16] <wa5ted> Velveeta: i want this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgKptbCj_jc
[17:45:20] <jeffreylevesque> if anyone would like to lend me an extra eye (maybe a pair), suggestions would be cool - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/tree/master/src/js
[17:45:22] <Velveeta> oh well, he can spend the next 37 hours debugging it i guess
[17:45:49] <wa5ted> jeffreylevesque: what are we looking at
[17:46:05] <jeffreylevesque> anything jquery related
[17:46:28] <wa5ted> im so confused what your question is
[17:47:50] <Velveeta> you'll get the best feedback if you ask targeted questions, jeff
[17:47:54] <jeffreylevesque> Wondering if my jquery code is ideal, just in general
[17:48:20] <jeffreylevesque> I've gotten tired today, have to do some python sql tomorrow
[17:48:23] <Velveeta> like, is there a portion of your jquery code that you're thinking is suboptimal? because nobody's gonna want to wade through all of it from top to bottom just to point things out at random
[17:48:39] <wa5ted> ^ beat me to it
[17:49:10] <jeffreylevesque> true
[17:49:45] <wa5ted> Velveeta: watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0L_iyeoiqE
[17:49:48] <wa5ted> the entire thing
[17:49:53] <wa5ted> you willl die alughing
[17:50:05] <wa5ted> thinkxl: watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0L_iyeoiqE
[17:50:12] <jeffreylevesque> i have a form consisting of various html form fields, and then fields for uploads.  variaous fields are submitted on one ajax post method, while the file upload array fields are submitted via a different second post method
[17:50:38] <acidjazz> wait
[17:50:42] <acidjazz> these fields vare various
[17:50:47] <acidjazz> how various are we talking about
[17:51:09] <acidjazz> like owuld you say the spectrum of their variableness is extremely wide
[17:51:10] <thinkxl> what is it
[17:51:21] <jeffreylevesque> just predefined fields
[17:51:30] <wa5ted> thinkxl: there is a game called counterstrike global offensive and the guy unboxes a rare item
[17:51:32] <wa5ted> watch
[17:51:35] <jeffreylevesque> though two of them are array, where i can add more fields
[17:51:36] <wa5ted> its funny
[17:51:40] <thinkxl> wtf
[17:51:45] <thinkxl> lol
[17:54:07] <Velveeta> well, i only opened one file, and it's pretty huge, and i've been drinking, so i'm not gonna be full of pointers here
[17:54:20] <Velveeta> but for one thing, this code seems to be very implementation-specific
[17:56:27] <jeffreylevesque> true
[17:57:07] <jeffreylevesque> though, it is capable of being generic based on the forms ability to add more dependent and independent variables
[17:57:37] <jeffreylevesque> variables = form fields within it's respective form array field
[17:58:09] <Velveeta> right, but it's still tightly coupled to the naming conventions you've put in place.. your delegated event listeners are bound up to listen for inputs by name, as opposed to some kind of class name convention
[17:58:26] <jeffreylevesque> ahh yea
[17:58:27] <Velveeta> so it's only extensible insofar as you name the new form fields the exact same way
[17:58:53] <jeffreylevesque> that may later need remodeling
[17:59:28] <Velveeta> also, i'm assuming this is being written specifically to fill some need in your own site or something, which is why those field names are so specific
[17:59:42] <Velveeta> and if that's the case, are you using any kind of client-side templating library like handlebars or anything?
[17:59:58] <jeffreylevesque> no, sir
[18:00:03] <Velveeta> because if so, all of those string literally html fragments you have in html_form.js, i'd move out to a template
[18:00:20] <jeffreylevesque> not sure what handle bars are.  I've used jquery-validation - nothing fancy other than that
[18:00:22] <Velveeta> gotcha, well, i'd probably still move them out to something in the dom, and just reference them as needed
[18:00:38] <Velveeta> you can do something like this (i'll throw together a quick jsfiddle example)
[18:04:02] <jeffreylevesque> i'm taking a look at handlebars
[18:04:04] <jeffreylevesque> looks cool
[18:06:55] <Velveeta> so you can do something similar without handlebars, by just moving your template out of the js string literals and into the dom, and referencing them as needed, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7pxo7q8q/
[18:06:58] <jeffreylevesque> not sure how i'd dynamically use that with respect to all the necessary on events
[18:07:34] <Velveeta> that takes the top chunk of code from your html_form.js file, and moves those 2 first templates (for analysis and training) into the dom
[18:08:23] <Velveeta> and then it just tries to reference them by id, which is constructed based on the val().toLowerCase() value, plus "-session", and if it finds an element with that id, it sets the template equal to that element's .html(), otherwise, it nulls out the reference
[18:12:17] <jeffreylevesque> Velveeta: i don't see the jsfiddle result.  Your snippet dynamically covers the first two fieldsets?  Is it a good idea to have inline script tags like you have done?
[18:12:30] <jeffreylevesque> this looks fancier than what i have previously done
[18:12:44] <Velveeta> there is no jsfiddle result to be displayed, it's just a proof of concept, not a working demo
[18:13:07] <Velveeta> and yes, it's fine to have inline scripts like that for the purposes of providing client-side html markup snippets like that
[18:13:25] <Velveeta> however, if it made you more comfortable with the concept, you could always stick them in divs that are just hidden w/ css
[18:14:00] <jeffreylevesque> this is a similar concept to jquery handlebars?
[18:14:25] <jeffreylevesque> the benefit of your suggestion, is shorter code?
[18:14:43] <jeffreylevesque> i think i will make an issue, and try to implement this
[18:15:21] <jeffreylevesque> is this consider better practice, faster to process than my method of creating dom elements strictly in jquery?
[18:16:16] <jeffreylevesque> well, not quite handlebars - but, cool custom jquery / html code
[18:17:45] <Velveeta> it's more about ease of maintenance than code optimization... your inline strings would actually process faster, i'm pretty sure, because there's dom parsing being done in my method
[18:18:12] <Velveeta> but it removes a lot of the clutter from the code, making it easier tor ead and understand, and means that your templates can be altered in the markup at will, if that's ever desired
[18:18:55] <Velveeta> it's a partial separation of concerns, moving the markup to the markup where it belongs, and out of the js, and keeping the js organized around the process being done, as opposed to a compilation of markup and then performing some prodcess on it
[18:21:01] <Velveeta> it's a similar concept as putting the styles into external css files instead of inlining them on the elements... you can do it either way, but one way comes with easier maintenance concerns going forward
[18:21:01] <jeffreylevesque> true
[18:21:07] <jeffreylevesque> i've always been curious though
[18:21:32] <jeffreylevesque> if you have dynamic HTML dom elements, should they be in the DOM, even if not displayed (css:hidden)?
[18:21:54] <jeffreylevesque> css:hidden, or don't create elements in the DOM
[18:22:28] <Velveeta> when you say dynamic html elements, do you mean dynamic in that they don't exist at load time, or do you mean dynamic in that they change their content?
[18:23:08] <jeffreylevesque> when an event is triggered, a dom element is created vs when an event is triggered, an existing dom is made 'display:block'
[18:23:27] <jeffreylevesque> something of that nature
[18:24:58] <Velveeta> ok, so that's static content, at least from what i was reading in the chunk of your code i used as an example... it's not created until some event is triggered, but the content that *is* created isn't variable, like it doesn't take say, the id of the element that triggered it, and output that as part of the generated content
[18:25:31] <Velveeta> so the content itself can be stored in the dom, and i'm not saying that when the event is triggered, you simple show the div, i'm saying that when the event is triggered, you pull the content template from the dom and inject a new instance of it
[18:26:11] <Velveeta> the same operation you're currently doing, but instead of the content living in a js string literal that you just evaluate and inject into the dom each time the event is triggered, you pull a copy of it out of the dom, in the container where it's housed, and inject that template back into the dom in the target location
[18:27:37] <Velveeta> if it was something simple like '<input class="edit" />' i'd probably just inline it in the js, but this is a lot more complex markup, so it's a lot more visual clutter in your code, which should instead be located in the markup where it reads a lot more naturally
[18:34:42] <Mark_2> can anyone help me figure out how to install this js plugin on my webpage?
[18:34:52] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/test#0
[18:35:11] <Mark_2> http://glide.jedrzejchalubek.com/
[18:35:14] <Mark_2> im having a bit of trouble.
[18:36:56] <Velveeta> what is this, i don't even..
[19:09:22] <ilhami> hello
[19:09:29] <ilhami> anybody here who is not sleeping? :-)
[19:13:01] * Velveeta sleeptypes "no"
[19:13:38] <ilhami> I have problems dude. Really big problems. :P
[19:14:39] <Velveeta> like, 99 of them?
[19:14:51] <blackkbot> like 98 because the bitch is dead
[19:14:55] <blackkbot> oh wait thats a problem
[19:14:58] <blackkbot> 100
[19:15:08] <Velveeta> damn
[19:16:54] <acidjazz> dang
[19:18:03] <Velveeta> so i count 3 non-sleeping people here so far... and still no explanation of any problems?
[19:18:17] <ilhami> Hehe. well I am trying to fix it. :s
[19:18:30] * blackkbot falls asleep
[19:20:26] <ilhami> haha I fixed it partially. :-D
[19:21:28] <Velveeta> we helped, that's how good we are
[19:22:48] <ilhami> http://displayking.de/index.php ok go here. I am trying to make a function that highlights the url based on the clicked item. My icon and text are two separate things and e.g. when I hover over the navicon I change the image to a blue one instead. So now I made it work by changing an image but right now it's set to use the same image for all 5 icons. There is an url for each icon. How will I solve that?
[19:23:37] <ilhami> now it works only with one image. :-) if you click on all of the icons you will see the home icon lol
[19:24:46] <blackkbot> use css?
[19:24:52] <blackkbot> don't use js to change images
[19:24:59] <blackkbot> on hover or click
[19:25:05] * Velveeta gives a thumbs-up.
[19:25:13] <ilhami> nah it's not on hover or click. It's on current page.
[19:25:20] <Velveeta> well, it's also on hover
[19:25:29] <ilhami> on hover I do use css
[19:25:38] <ilhami> can I do the same for .current?
[19:25:42] <blackkbot> :active
[19:25:44] <blackkbot> no
[19:25:46] <blackkbot> hmm
[19:25:52] <Velveeta> i would probably make transparent versions of those images and use a background color change so there's no wait on the load time
[19:26:02] <Velveeta> either that, or render them as font icons and treat them the same as the text they sit next to
[19:26:15] <blackkbot> velveeta is right thats what i was thinking
[19:26:26] <blackkbot> but i was going in a bad direction and stoppped
[19:27:08] <ilhami> Velveeta: should I do the first thing you said?
[19:27:16] <ilhami> or?
[19:27:32] <ilhami> they are svg images btw.
[19:27:38] <Velveeta> well, either one is a potential solution, but i think the industry trend is leaning towards font icons these days
[19:27:58] <ilhami> or svg documents whatever
[19:28:00] <Velveeta> i used to do something similar with transparent images and a background color
[19:28:11] <ilhami> can svg be made transparent?
[19:28:16] <blackkbot> of course
[19:28:18] <Velveeta> the problem with that technique though, is that you have to set the foreground color equal to whatever the container background is
[19:28:34] <blackkbot> no way
[19:28:36] <Velveeta> e.g. you have them in a yellow container right now, so you'd have to make a yellow image with a transparent cutout where the color is to show through at
[19:28:48] <Velveeta> so it gets pretty ugly for an implementation going that route
[19:28:58] <blackkbot> can't you clip
[19:29:00] <blackkbot> clip mask
[19:29:16] <blackkbot> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/
[19:29:18] <Velveeta> good question, i'm not sure, i don't play with clip masks :)
[19:29:25] <Velveeta> but i've seen some neat stuff done with them
[19:29:41] <ilhami> it's not my images btw.
[19:29:46] <ilhami> and not my site.
[19:29:55] <ilhami> I am helping some other guy.
[19:30:16] <ilhami> he told me to use those images.
[19:30:42] <blackkbot> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/#toc-the-mask-property
[19:30:48] <blackkbot> oh then just do what he said
[19:31:22] <ilhami> if there is just a good way to map those images with each nav item
[19:32:34] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/1M4r
[19:32:37] <ilhami> this is the function as of now
[19:33:00] <blackkbot> ie doesn't support mask
[19:33:02] <blackkbot> at all
[19:34:05] <ilhami> so will I basically have to check each url?
[19:34:43] <Velveeta> just apply class names to the anchors and reference the icons that way
[19:35:28] <ilhami> aah wait.
[19:35:32] <Velveeta> you have a home link, repair, additional, etc
[19:35:32] <ilhami> I have it.
[19:35:51] <Velveeta> just add class names like that to the anchors, and then a current class, and add css rules for .home.current, .repair.current, etc
[19:36:16] <Velveeta> looks like right now you're just using an id selector of #navicon2 to set the background url
[19:36:59] <blackkbot> $('a[href='+window.location.href).each(function(){$(this).addClass('current');});
[19:37:50] <Velveeta> oh you're talking about that aspect of it
[19:38:01] <blackkbot> lose the if and use a different selector
[19:38:20] <Velveeta> yeah, unless you're doing url checking on the back end adding a class name when the page is rendered, you'll have to do something similar to blackkbot's suggestion after page load
[19:38:33] <ilhami> should I use your code instead of what I have blackbot?
[19:38:40] <blackkbot> try it
[19:38:47] <blackkbot> see if it works for you
[19:39:37] <Velveeta> you'll still need to set up new css rules for what that .current class means
[19:39:43] <Velveeta> for each individual icon
[19:39:53] <blackkbot> unless you use mask and say screw ie
[19:40:05] <z1haze> Hello, I am trying to change the href of a link using jquery, but I need to be able to specify the link without adding a class to it.. can it be does like in css you can do :nth(3) ?
[19:40:13] <Velveeta> because right now it looks like it's just using js to set an inline background-image style on the current item
[19:40:28] <ilhami> Velveeta: I have an idea.
[19:40:37] <ilhami> blackkbot: I will go back to mine and try something.
[19:40:58] <Velveeta> z1haze: yes, you can reference it with a selector like that, it just ties it specifically to that dom location and doesn't make it very portable
[19:41:03] <blackkbot> hes gone isn't he
[19:41:13] <blackkbot> oh zee one
[19:41:24] <blackkbot> not zl  stupid fonts
[19:43:17] <ilhami> is there something called hasCSS ?
[19:43:19] <ilhami> a function
[19:43:42] <ilhami> hasClass
[19:43:42] <ilhami> :d
[19:43:43] <ilhami> great
[19:44:08] <Velveeta> yeah hasClass
[19:44:13] <blackkbot> i like the dom classList.contains and add toggle remove stuff rather than jquerys fwiw
[19:44:37] <Velveeta> again, if you're scrapping IE support
[19:45:11] <Velveeta> when the world is on IE11+ in like 47 years, it'll be a much better place
[19:45:27] <blackkbot> ie9 whatever
[19:45:28] <ilhami> heh
[19:45:41] <blackkbot> but mask god damn ie is horrible
[19:46:02] <Velveeta> classlist doesn't exist in ie9 if that's what you're saying
[19:46:06] <Velveeta> at least, according to caniuse
[19:46:23] <Velveeta> 10+
[19:46:40] <Velveeta> but i say 11+ because *that's* when it'll get to be a much more beautiful world to work in :D
[19:46:51] <blackkbot> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff972267(v=vs.85).aspx
[19:46:54] <blackkbot> wtf
[19:47:41] <blackkbot> yeah i know screw ie9 i want nothing to do with that
[19:48:08] <Velveeta> i want nothing to do with it myself... but i also like my paycheck... and my corporate overlords want something to do with it...
[19:48:40] <blackkbot> i suppose i could shim it to fill it in with jquery but then id have to figure out jquerys
[19:49:15] <Genitrust> anyone know how to pass a cookie to an ajax request that's going to a REST API?
[19:49:44] <Genitrust> or does anyone know what i can search to find the answer to this?
[19:49:44] <Velveeta> i was asked to shim the control property for inputs, and i did, but it was so ugly for IE8 because it required an event trigger to shim dynamic content
[19:50:16] <Velveeta> genitrust: look at the headers property: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[19:50:30] <Velveeta> you can probably set up your cookie data with that
[19:51:09] <Velveeta> although it should be passing cookie info automatically if you're contacting an endpoint that complies with its cookie security
[19:52:25] <Genitrust> thx Velveeta
[19:52:40] <Velveeta> are you contacting a domain that's separate from the one that cookie is set up for?
[19:52:48] <Genitrust> yup, i'm connecting to a separate API
[19:53:22] <Genitrust> looks like i just need to do (in the ajax object argument), 'headers': {'Cookie': 'sessionid=blahblah'} ?
[19:53:26] <Genitrust> does that look about right?
[19:54:16] <Velveeta> not sure off the top of my head, i don't typically send custom headers in my requests
[19:54:23] <Velveeta> but play with it and see if it works
[19:54:43] <Genitrust> thanks
[19:54:51] <Genitrust> i've been trying to figure this out for over a week honestly.
[19:55:16] <blackkbot> really isn't it in the api?
[19:55:55] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/dgfw trying something like this now.
[19:56:21] <blackkbot> you did nothing what i said
[19:56:26] <blackkbot> but ok
[19:56:29] <ilhami> I did try your solution.
[19:56:47] <blackkbot> no?
[19:56:56] <Genitrust> blackkbot: i'm making the API =[
[19:57:13] <ilhami> I tried with your code.
[19:57:18] <ilhami> right before
[19:57:31] <blackkbot> yeah i messed it up
[19:57:32] <blackkbot> lol
[19:57:33] <Velveeta> ilhami: why are you setting the background image with js instead of just using regular css?
[19:57:52] <Velveeta> lines 142-145 in that example are completely unnecessary
[19:57:56] <blackkbot> $('a[href='+location.href+']')
[19:58:00] <Velveeta> er rather 7-10
[19:58:04] <blackkbot> duhh i forgot the ]
[19:58:08] <blackkbot> lol
[19:58:39] <ilhami> ok let me try with css then.
[19:59:21] <Velveeta> “Velveeta: you'll still need to set up new css rules for what that .current class means”
[19:59:45] <ilhami> I have an idea. 2 sec.
[20:00:30] <Velveeta> jackiechanwtf.jpg
[20:01:25] <blackkbot> $('a[href$='+location.pathName+']')
[20:03:00] <blackkbot> lowercase pathname
[20:03:13] <ilhami> can't I add .current somehow to the hover rules I have. It's the same rules I want applied..
[20:03:17] <blackkbot> damn it
[20:03:23] <ilhami> ?
[20:03:37] <blackkbot> $('a[href$="'+location.pathName+'"]')
[20:03:58] <Velveeta> yes, you can add .current to your hover rules
[20:03:59] <ilhami> #navicon1:hover .current something like this doesn't work.
[20:04:06] <Velveeta> but not that way
[20:04:07] <blackkbot> not on hover
[20:04:12] <blackkbot> a.current
[20:04:22] <blackkbot> hovering the current should do what?
[20:04:25] <Velveeta> because that's telling css "any current-class that's a child of a #navicon1:hover element"
[20:04:30] <Velveeta> use a comma
[20:04:47] <Velveeta> #navicon1:hover, #navicon.current { }
[20:04:56] <Velveeta> er #navicon1.current
[20:05:50] <blackkbot> like html,body{} is for both body and html but html body{} is only body
[20:06:06] <Velveeta> right
[20:06:22] <ilhami> finally!
[20:06:50] <ilhami> but now there is a final problem.
[20:07:14] <blackkbot> this sounds like we are going in a nazi direction
[20:07:29] <ilhami> nazi direction? :S
[20:07:33] <Velveeta> and not the good kind of nazi direction i'm guessing
[20:07:45] <ilhami> what ya mean?
[20:07:50] <blackkbot> the "final solution"
[20:08:02] <blackkbot> its the nazi plan to exterminate jews
[20:08:07] <ilhami> :-D
[20:08:07] <blackkbot> but continue
[20:08:15] <blackkbot> not killing jews
[20:08:24] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/EYcyVRZ.jpg
[20:08:31] <ilhami> http://displayking.de/ go to this url instead.
[20:08:36] <ilhami> that will not work heh
[20:08:36] <blackkbot> explaining your problem
[20:08:42] <blackkbot> that is the cutest hitler ever
[20:08:53] <Velveeta> and also, wtf parents
[20:09:11] <ilhami> It should just pick Startseite per default
[20:09:27] <ilhami> should I just add that class in the html then?
[20:10:25] <blackkbot> umm no
[20:10:46] <Velveeta> or you can just assign your "$('a[href$="'+location.pathName+'"]')" to a variable, and if thatVariable.length === 0, just hand-select the 'home' anchor and add current to it
[20:11:36] <ilhami> before I tried to check window.path.href == '/' lol
[20:11:38] <ilhami> that didnt work.
[20:12:19] <ilhami> or was it window.location.href*
[20:12:25] <ilhami> sorry
[20:12:42] <blackkbot> yeah location.pathname
[20:13:05] <ilhami> will that work?
[20:13:13] <Velveeta> one way to find out
[20:13:18] <ilhami> try it.
[20:13:20] <ilhami> :-D
[20:13:32] <Genitrust> for the ajax documentation on jquery's site, the xhrFields object documentation says: "An object of fieldName-fieldValue pairs to set on the native XHR object."
[20:13:50] <Genitrust> where does the fieldName/Value go?
[20:14:05] <Genitrust> where can i find it? the header?
[20:14:09] <Genitrust> oh wait...
[20:14:57] <Velveeta> i don't think you're looking for that property
[20:15:13] <Velveeta> that's meant to set properties on the native xhr object (like it says), which typically supports the following properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
[20:15:32] <blackkbot> damn it
[20:16:42] <Genitrust> hmm =|
[20:16:46] <Genitrust> k another question... http://pastie.org/private/r0zq7vc5ilrzgmxzwwgauw
[20:16:50] <Genitrust> wtf. that's my question. lol
[20:17:01] <ilhami> that worked nice :)
[20:17:07] <Genitrust> does this mean that the browser ignores the '*' for allowed hosts from the API server?
[20:17:08] <ilhami> ooooh
[20:17:09] <ilhami> wait
[20:17:18] <blackkbot> $('a[href$="'+location.href.split(location.pathname).pop()+'"]')
[20:17:27] <ilhami> nah it works.
[20:17:59] <Velveeta> genitrust: that's what i would gather from that error text
[20:18:43] <Genitrust> that's bull sht. if the server says wildcard * is fine... the browser should obey it, right?
[20:18:56] <Velveeta> not if the browser deems that to be a bad security practice
[20:19:19] <blackkbot> yeah the browser determines what you can do in js
[20:19:28] <Genitrust> sooo , some other browser decides to allow it? if any of these browser devs are here, you guys should know *NOT* to dictate this...
[20:19:37] <Genitrust> ok i'm just venting. you guys are right :(
[20:19:49] <Genitrust> so basically... wildcard '*' would be allowed if it weren't localhost?
[20:19:56] <Genitrust> :D ?
[20:20:04] <blackkbot> try jquery
[20:20:06] <blackkbot> jsfiddle
[20:20:07] <blackkbot> sorry
[20:20:14] <Genitrust> good point blackkbot
[20:21:50] <ilhami> thanks for your help.
[20:21:57] <Genitrust> so eh, how can i test my code if the browser's gunna be like this? -.-
[20:22:14] <blackkbot> test your code on jsfiddle.net
[20:22:17] <blackkbot> right?
[20:22:32] <blackkbot> its a domain that isn't localhost
[20:22:36] <Genitrust> but jsfiddle cannot access my dev API running on 127.0.0.1 -.-
[20:22:43] <blackkbot> oh .... lol
[20:22:50] <blackkbot> open your router
[20:22:55] <ilhami> use postman?
[20:23:01] <ilhami> :-D
[20:23:06] <Genitrust> open my router? i haz no router
[20:23:06] <ilhami> won't that work
[20:23:07] <ilhami> ?
[20:23:12] <Genitrust> postman = ?
[20:23:22] <ilhami> what do you want tested?
[20:23:31] <ilhami> sorry didnt read whole convo
[20:23:55] <Genitrust> i wanna test some html/js running on 'localhost' with a different server running on 127.0.0.1 -.-
[20:23:58] <blackkbot> try connecting to your page
[20:24:00] <blackkbot> pool-96-243-179-179.tampfl.fios.verizon.net
[20:24:12] <Genitrust> blackkbot: that won't work; this isn't external facing
[20:24:33] <blackkbot> you can't make it
[20:24:55] <ilhami> you need to forward some ports afaik
[20:25:03] <ilhami> I am not an networking expert.
[20:25:33] <Velveeta> set your hosts file with a fake domain name
[20:25:41] <Velveeta> and point it to 127.0.0.1
[20:25:45] <blackkbot> or localhost
[20:27:56] <ilhami> it's 05.27 :-D
[20:28:02] <ilhami> AM
[20:28:23] <sshaginyan> Guys
[20:28:25] <Velveeta> no no no, meester.. it's only 10:27pm
[20:28:40] <blackkbot> i gotta agree with Velveeta here
[20:29:04] <sshaginyan> How would I do a regex such as /[abcd(%[0-9][0-9]ef)]/
[20:29:09] <ilhami> you must live in murica. :-S
[20:29:21] <blackkbot> why the name Velveeta anyways? i hate that cheese but it does make a nice salsa con queso
[20:29:21] <Velveeta> sshaginyan: try something like this: /[abcd(%[0-9][0-9]ef)]/
[20:29:33] <Velveeta> blackkbot: that's about the only nice thing it makes :D
[20:29:47] <blackkbot> grilled cheese too
[20:29:49] <Velveeta> it's an old and not terribly exciting story, but i've been using this name online for about the last 20 years now
[20:29:53] <blackkbot> but you gotta be careful
[20:29:55] <Velveeta> i actually have the twitter handle too
[20:30:10] <blackkbot> really? the company didn't beat you to it?
[20:30:14] <sshaginyan> Velveeta: So basically I want to match a or b or c or d or % num num or e or f.
[20:30:44] <Velveeta> blackkbot: they sure didn't :D i even got features in some article about people that beat companies to their names on twitter, apparently.. i found out after it was posted
[20:31:14] <Velveeta> sshaginyan: you'll have to break that up into different clauses with or's
[20:31:18] <Velveeta> something like this:
[20:31:19] <blackkbot> [abcdef]|(%\d{2})
[20:32:01] <blackkbot> this /([abcdef]|(?:%\d{2}))/
[20:32:03] <Velveeta> damnit, it ate my regex
[20:32:10] <Velveeta> yeah, something like what blackkbot just posted
[20:32:24] <blackkbot> yeah gotta put something before the /
[20:32:51] <sshaginyan> blackkbot: Can I also do /([abcdef]|(?:%\d{2}))+/
[20:33:09] <Velveeta> blackkbot: here it is :D http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/12-ordinary-people-who-beat-major-brands-their-own-twitter-handle-160154
[20:33:13] <sshaginyan> blackkbot: What if I want to mix and match
[20:33:23] <blackkbot> any combination of those sure
[20:33:33] <blackkbot> ababaa%12abba would match
[20:33:44] <blackkbot> might need to escape the %
[20:33:46] <sshaginyan> So a%08bc%99def
[20:33:53] <Velveeta> funnily enough, the person that owns the @kraft twitter handle is also a regular person, also in an engineering type of capacity, and from the same city as me :D
[20:34:01] <sshaginyan> blackkbot: no % fine
[20:34:42] <blackkbot> ok i rarely trust characters that aren't alphanumeric
[20:35:22] <sshaginyan> Cool man thanks
[20:38:06] <blackkbot> Velveeta yeah most people are regular people :-P and it shouldn't be too surprising that people who are computer saavy got the twitter names before everyone else
[20:38:21] <Velveeta> yeah, i was surprised it wasn't taken when i went to get it
[20:38:41] <blackkbot> kraft has no reason to get on twitter
[20:38:49] <blackkbot> who would subscribe
[20:38:52] <Velveeta> they need to focus on their queso recipes
[20:38:58] <blackkbot> lol
[20:38:59] <Velveeta> i get a surprising number of mistweets
[20:39:11] <Velveeta> which i typically forward on to @EatLiquidGold to stay on friendly terms
[20:39:20] <Velveeta> maybe one of these days they'll offer to buy the name off of me :D
[20:39:31] <blackkbot> ehhh
[20:40:59] <blackkbot> liquid gold is a bit rich
[20:41:20] <Nautilus> I'm looking at http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/ for a background slider, wondering if people think thats a good one or have alternates to suggest
[20:41:58] <blackkbot> css?
[20:42:59] <Genitrust> damn =[
[20:43:15] <Genitrust> it looks like the xhr object's 'getAllResponseHeaders' does NOT give you the 'Set-Cookie' header. damn it >[
[20:43:59] <Nautilus> blackkbot: dont want to reinvent a slider, but did you have something built to suggest?
[20:47:04] <blackkbot> using css transitions to slide an image over and  set the z-index -99999 and position:fixed
[20:53:25] <Nautilus> that doesnt do the thumbnail strip and things
[20:53:40] <acidjazz> this does https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX5DebXH4Uw
[20:56:28] <blackkbot> oh well i thought it was just for a background
[20:56:39] <blackkbot> if its for that thing then sure do that thing lol
[21:02:01] <Nautilus> blackkbot: thanks for the feedback

[22:07:46] <Majick> Question about $.ajax. Why does the object assigned to the request sometimes have a responseJSON property and sometimes not? The requests are all successful.
[22:09:27] <Majick> In the .done part of the request I'm trying to get just the response, but the data doesn't seem to exist outside of that function. All attempts are 'undefined'
[22:28:24] <duckx0r> This is maybe a dumb question, but is it possible to use jquery to set the value of an input element without actually changing its "value" attribute?
[22:29:50] <duckx0r> sort of like, if you have <input value="0" /> and then change its value using the browser to something else. It doesn't change the "value" attribute of the element
[22:34:37] <duckx0r> nevermind, i got it.
[23:30:17] <CssNoob> :)
