[05:12:58] <baako> hi guys, class="foo bar" how do i get the last class e.g. bar if i did not know it was called bar? I know it will always be the last class
[05:14:38] <baako> got it
[05:15:01] <Cork> baako: i would quite strongly recommend against doing that
[05:15:33] <Cork> you will write code that will break if it gets new functionality in the future
[05:15:36] <baako> $(this).attr('class').split(' ').pop(); Cork
[05:15:45] <Cork> ya, again a bad idea
[05:15:54] <baako> Cork, why?
[05:16:01] <Cork> see two lines up
[05:16:27] <Cork> you require that the class attribute never change or your code will break
[05:17:03] <baako> Cork, it wouldnt because am the one adding it via js
[05:17:12] <baako>                     ul.append('<li class="scrollable-selector__item ' + type + '">' + data[i].SubBuilding + ' ' + data[i].Building + ', ' + data[i].Street + ', ' + data[i].City + ', ' + data[i].Postcode + "</li>");
[05:17:18] <Cork> baako: ugg...
[05:17:24] <baako> see the "type"
[05:17:34] <baako> thats what I want to get in an on click event
[05:17:37] <Cork> baako: if you need to be able to reference it later add a data-type
[05:17:55] <baako> Cork, great idea
[05:17:59] <Cork> cause else if anything else needs to add a class to that elemebnt it will break your code
[05:18:28] <Cork> (i didn't mean your code will break you, but that new code needed will, cause your code expect to own the entire element)
[05:18:40] <Woet> baako: as mentioned countless times before, ask your *actual* question
[05:22:31] <baako> Woet, I did ask my question and Cork suggested something much better
[05:22:49] <baako> Woet, what question should I have asked?
[05:23:23] <Cork> baako: there is a difference between asking how do i get the last value in class, and how do i best access the class i add at position y
[05:23:50] <deva_> I am parsing comments from a json file and inserting them for user to view. Now I have another json file which contains each comment id (like_id) and user_id... If any entry of comment_likes.json matches user_id and like_id with user_id and comment_id in the $.each #9, I would like to insert a image/heart if there is a match (type of matched is 1 in comment_likes.json), any ideas?  https://dpaste.de/2GvG
[05:24:10] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery  i am getting 500 error by this code
[05:24:43] <Cork> deva_: i would prob just use a css class
[05:25:34] <Cork> Rockwood: default action for a button is submit
[05:25:44] <deva_> Cork: But how to detect of each comment if it was liked and apply the css when match?
[05:25:47] <Cork> Rockwood: so if this code is inside a form anywhere it will submit it
[05:26:04] <Cork> Rockwood: simplest solution is to set type="button" on the button element
[05:26:45] <deva_> Cork: the css/html needs to be injected into the html of that $.each somehow
[05:27:12] <deva_> feeling lost on how to accomplish that
[05:28:14] <Cork> deva_: i would loop the likes file and build an object of arrays {<user_id>: [<like_id>,<like_id>,<like_id>]}
[05:28:39] <Cork> then you can just do map[user_id].indexOf(like_id) > -1
[05:29:00] <Cork> else you would have to loop the likes object for every comment
[05:29:03] <Woet> baako: you asked "how do i get the last class e.g. bar if i did not know it was called bar?", which is the weird workaround you thought of solving the issue
[05:29:12] <Cork> might be ok too, except if you have a loot of comments it can be slow
[05:29:21] <Rockwood> Cork, https://kopy.io/Gkceo
[05:29:28] <Woet> baako: instead, ask your actual issue: "I'm adding a class using JS and need to retrieve it later for an onclick, how can I do that"
[05:29:52] <Cork> Rockwood: what do you want me to do with that?
[05:30:04] <deva_> Cork: thank you, and how would you inject the html when matching?
[05:30:08] <Rockwood> Cork, in case of }elseif(operation === 'finishquiz') i am getting 500
[05:30:28] <Woet> Rockwood: JS doesn't send 500 errors.
[05:31:06] <Cork> if(map[].indexOf() > -1) { row.find('.comment-box').addClass('liked'); }
[05:31:20] <deva_> Cork: ahh :), thanks a lot will try
[05:31:21] <baako> Woet and Cork thanks. I understand your point now. I didnt think how Cork was thinking because seen I am adding the class with JS, i didnt think of future events which might cause this to change
[05:31:28] <baako> thanks for pointing it out :)
[05:32:06] <Rockwood> server only cause of 500 or route defined?
[05:32:41] <Woet> Rockwood: I don't speak that language, but as mentioned, JS does not cause or send 500 errors.
[05:32:56] <Rockwood> ah okay
[05:33:04] <Rockwood> thanks for help
[05:33:07] <Cork> well only server ever generates http status
[05:33:18] <Cork> so ya, it can't be js
[05:33:36] <Cork> (as you have to have a http connection to be able to get a status)
[05:34:03] <Rockwood> ah okay
[05:34:12] <Rockwood> now i get it
[05:34:38] <Cork> whos fault it is isn't defined by that though :)
[05:35:00] <Cork> it might be the server having a problem, or the client going somewhere it shouldn't
[05:35:47] <Rockwood> your this point is valid in my case "the client going somewhere it shouldn't"
[05:36:04] <Cork> ya, and that was my first answer too
[05:36:17] <Cork> you have a button that is used as a button, but is a submit action
[08:04:18] <baako> https://kopy.io/TwwSN I have prevented a submit action so i can do a quick check. If the change first statement fails i want to normal form action to happen. how do I undo it?
[08:05:28] <Cork> baako: you don't
[08:05:34] <deva__> Cork: what about something like this? think I am missing something because like_id do not get collected it seems .... https://dpaste.de/fxFQ
[08:05:38] <Cork> you do it the other way around
[08:06:09] <baako> Cork, what u mean other way round
[08:06:27] <Cork> deva__: no you need to loop likes and then check for linke_id in each loop
[08:06:42] <Cork> baako: only call event.preventDefault() if something fails to validate
[08:08:14] <Cork> deva__: are all the comments for the same user?
[08:08:47] <Cork> meaning will user_id always be "1"
[08:08:49] <deva__> Cork: what would you use to collect all the like_id's into the array? ({<user_id>: [<like_id>,<like_id>,<like_id>]})
[08:09:14] <Cork> what i suggested wans't a flat array
[08:09:52] <Cork> deva__: what i suggested is something like var liked = {}; $.each(likes, function(i, o) { liked[o.user_id] ||= []; liked[o.user_id].push(o.like_id); }
[08:10:53] <deva__> Cork: understand, thanks a lot
[08:13:33] <deva__> Cork: I receive syntax error on the "|| = [];" Unexpected token =
[08:13:51] <Cork> deva__: shouldn't be a space between those
[08:14:07] <Cork> ||= not || =
[08:14:40] <Cork> liked[o.user_id] ||= [] is the same as liked[o.user_id] = liked[o.user_id] || []
[08:17:07] <Lenswipee> How's it going Corky?
[08:17:28] <Cork> ok, i guess
[08:17:42] <Lenswipee> That's good :-)
[08:20:01] <deva__> Cork: hmm still same without space
[08:20:54] <baako> Cork, i added  e.preventDefault(); in the if statement that i want to prevent the form submmit but the form still submit
[08:21:23] <baako> https://kopy.io/fouSH
[08:22:04] <baako> fixed it
[08:24:40] <deva__> Cork: was missing the last );
[08:24:55] <Cork> deva__: bah, too much other languages javascript doesn't have ||=
[08:24:57] <deva__> Super thank you!
[08:25:01] <Cork> np
[09:25:19] <deva__> receiving a: Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list error on this line: if(liked.indexOf(like_id) > -1) { row.find(".comment-'"+ like_id"'").after("<input type="button" value="Like" id="like_'"+ like_id"'" class="like" style="" />");};  .. But to me it appears to be there, any ideas?
[09:25:50] <Cork> deva__: please make a jsfiddle with the code
[09:26:00] <Cork> debugging code in the channel is close to impossible
[09:27:41] <deva__> ok
[09:32:11] <deva__> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/qmd2n56f/
[09:33:36] <Cork> deva__: your quites are mixed
[09:33:47] <Cork> (some use ' and some use ")
[09:33:56] <Cork> and the different formats isn't concted correctly
[09:34:16] <Cork> deva__: also i would prog recommend using elements instead of building it as html
[09:34:24] <Cork> (else you risk getting xss)
[09:34:49] <Cork> that is true for what you use for the resto of your code too btw
[09:34:55] <Cork> resto==rest
[09:50:05] <baako> Cork, i have a div which has some input fields. I am wondering what is the best way to chck if any of the input within this div has a class "error"
[09:50:42] <Cork> baako: from where?
[09:50:56] <Cork> meaning in what context are you wondering about this state
[09:51:13] <Rockwood> ty
[09:51:15] <Rockwood> cya
[09:51:49] <Uhkis> i wonder if hasClass() would help in trying to figure out if something has a class
[09:52:08] <Cork> Uhkis: only if you have the input as an element
[09:52:18] <Cork> .find() might be a better option in some cases
[09:52:31] <Cork> it all depends on from where he is checking
[09:52:36] <baako> Cork, an error class gets added when they is a server side validation error. The class is adding by laravel.The div it gets added to is hidden.  I want to remove the hidden class if any of the input field in this div has the error class
[09:53:18] <Rockwood> baako, why are you trying this?
[09:53:21] <Cork> baako: so the function runs as a response from the server?
[09:53:46] <Cork> (that is the context i was asking about)
[09:53:49] <baako> Cork, no function should run when the page loads
[09:54:02] <Cork> as the server responds with the new form?
[09:54:03] <baako> so when the server comes back with the error message, the page gets refresh
[09:54:08] * Cork nods
[09:54:14] <Uhkis> so basically you want $('.error').show() ?
[09:54:25] <Cork> then just do $('div input.error').closest('div').removeClass('hidden)
[09:54:45] <Cork> or .show() if it isn't a class
[09:55:43] <Cork> (you could use :has(), but i prefer to make the code express that this is a none performat action)
[09:56:33] <Cork> the full call should prob be $('div.hidden input.error').closest('div.hidden').removeClass('hidden')
[09:56:42] <baako> Cork, that works but i need to add a hidden class to another element
[09:57:09] <Cork> baako: well then you need to walk the dom from the div to that element and set the state
[10:00:16] <baako> Cork, was hoping to do something like this https://kopy.io/JxoCF
[10:06:59] <baako> Cork, do i need to loop to do it?
[10:14:29] <baako> Cork, i ended up with https://kopy.io/5mfDY does the job
[10:14:39] <baako> not sure if its the best way forward but it works
[10:22:12] <deva__> tnx Cork, will look into elements ... What about if(liked.indexOf() > -1) {} by the way, how do I refer to each id when array looks like https://jsfiddle.net/kbmr68e5/ ?
[10:45:15] <fellipe> hi everyone. I have a <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64, .... id="photo">  and I'm trying to change the height and widht, but no success. I tried: $("#foto_fundo").prop("style").width = some_number but nothing changes. How to do it?
[10:51:58] <taplar> css('width', some_number)
[11:07:48] <oriberu> Using DataTables' Responsive extension, is it possible to add data from hidden columns to an existing child row and not add a new control icon for the hidden data?
[11:17:46] <Guest72769> hmm, the class exists but no html inserted... Any ideas? https://jsfiddle.net/kbmr68e5/2/
[11:19:49] <taplar> can you add an example of the "liked" to that fiddle?
[11:23:26] <Guest72769> taplar: oki
[11:25:24] <Guest72769> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/kbmr68e5/3/
[11:28:23] <taplar> "$("div.comment-" + liked[key).afte" is that a typo on the "[key" in the fiddle or is that reflective of your code?
[11:30:34] <Guest72769> taplar: sry, just typo in fiddle, in code $("div.comment-" + liked[key])
[11:31:13] <Guest72769> corrected it now
[11:34:07] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kbmr68e5/5/
[11:34:18] <taplar> that log is logging an array.  Not really something that you can use in a selector
[11:38:20] <Guest72769> taplar: ahh, I suspected that... How do I retrieve each value correctly to use there?
[11:38:38] <taplar> if you want to use each one, that's another loop
[11:53:09] <Guest72769> taplar: Still having problems reaching the values, just get the "1" :), do you know? https://jsfiddle.net/wnfjk20d/
[11:55:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kbmr68e5/6/  your object key is the user_id
[11:59:16] <Guest72769> taplar: yes, wondering how to get the other value
[11:59:26] <Guest72769> its the one I need
[11:59:44] <taplar> you need the like_ids?
[12:02:27] <Guest72769> yes
[12:02:55] <taplar> so that's just liked[key].forEach
[12:26:35] <Guest72769> taplar: tnx, starting to look better, but strange its still not inserting the html even though the class ( div class="comment-box comment-87"> )  is there https://jsfiddle.net/wnfjk20d/1/  and to what I understand the .after() executes after that class has been inserted
[12:34:53] <taplar> after() inserts the element you give to the after, after the element you previously selected
[12:35:12] <taplar> so $(something).after('<div>') would insert a div after the something you selected
[12:36:33] <taplar> $('<div>').insertAfter(something)  would do the same thing, but the order is flipped, as you can see
[12:37:55] <Guest72769> taplar: works now :)  Had to move the code inside of the function loadComments() { ... was outside, thanks a lot for your help
[12:39:02] <taplar> good deal
[12:45:30] <jjrabbit> sup guys
[12:45:37] <robertmaxrees> mornibg
[12:45:40] <robertmaxrees> *morning
[12:45:46] <jjrabbit> does anybody else think jquery is insane
[12:45:52] <jjrabbit> there is a method for everything
[12:45:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> not for everything, but it can be very helpful.
[12:46:22] <jjrabbit> i was trying to select the first element of a list of objects
[12:46:27] <jjrabbit> and sure enough there already is a first()
[12:46:40] <jjrabbit> pretty cool
[12:47:58] <taplar> insane in the membrane
[12:48:26] <jjrabbit> *insane in the brain!*
