[01:28:47] <tsukasa_> hey guys, how can i have a function return a value from inside a $.ajax() call?
[01:29:26] <tsukasa_> eg function a { $.ajax(success: return true, error: return false) }
[01:29:50] <tsukasa_> i tried making it a synchronous request but i believe that didnt work...
[02:02:20] <Cork> tsukasa_: you can't, you can return the deferred object from ajax and use that though
[02:03:10] <Cork> function makeCall() { return $.ajax(...); } makeCall().done(function() { /* this is true */ }).fail(function() { /* this is false */ })
[02:03:59] <Cork> tsukasa_: synchronous is depricated and not supported for much longer in jquery so it is better to not even go that way (it is also bad for user experience)
[02:07:54] <tsukasa_> Cork: yeah the only reason i want synchronous in the first place is because its a user reg form that checks to see if the email is already present
[02:08:24] <Cork> tsukasa_: so disable the submit button until the check is done
[02:09:07] <tsukasa_> not a bad idea
[02:09:13] <Cork> or even better, do it as the user moves away from the user field, and require it to be "ok:ed" before enabling the submit button
[02:09:32] <Cork> and if it isn't show a "this user name is taken" beside the field
[02:09:49] <tsukasa_> i have both, but the last field is store name which does the same check onblur
[02:10:04] <tsukasa_> so you can click from that field to submit and its a race to see what finishes
[02:10:05] <tsukasa_> lol
[02:10:25] <Cork> tsukasa_: ya, btw don't forget to have the validation server side too
[02:10:31] <Cork> else the form won't be safe
[02:10:43] <tsukasa_> yeah
[02:10:47] <Cork> (meaning you have to validate the data as the final submit happens)
[02:11:22] <Cork> and in those cases it is just to make the user experience smoother
[02:11:35] <Cork> and then i would prob just abort the validation calls if the user hits submit
[02:11:45] <Cork> and handle "user taken" errors from the normal server instead
[02:11:55] <Cork> will be a less janky experience
[03:21:13] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:22:27] <jomofcw> I want to be able to refresh/submit a form by two way : when a value of this one has changed, and when the user explicitely submit it (clicking the submit button for example). Is their a way to know which one called the submit trogger, please ?
[03:22:33] <jomofcw> *Is there
[03:23:01] <Cork> "a value of this one has changed"??
[03:23:09] <Cork> what exactly is that suppose to mean?
[03:24:39] <jomofcw> Hello Cork !
[03:25:50] <jomofcw> For example, whith the "change event" of a SELECT. To give you the context : it's a form where I display a price. The price could change according to the value of the form. The submit button is there to add the product to the cart when the user finished to complete/change the value of the form.
[03:26:35] <Cork> jomofcw: well then you have the answer just there, when it is changed the change event is fired
[03:26:43] <Cork> and when the submit it clicked the submit event is fired
[03:26:57] <jomofcw> Cork the change event submit the form to get the new value.
[03:27:04] <jomofcw> *the new price
[03:27:10] <Cork> uh...
[03:27:18] <jomofcw> I would like to be able, in the submit event, to know what trigger it.
[03:27:23] <Cork> well then you can't identify the user clicking the submit
[03:27:29] <Cork> as both will fire the submit event
[03:27:42] <Cork> you could add a value for the fake submit event
[03:28:03] <jomofcw> Yup that's what I'm doing curently, just asking my self if there is a better way to do it.
[03:28:13] <Cork> something like $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit', [ 'is fake' ]);
[03:28:52] <Cork> well if they shouldn't be the same it might be worth thinking over if the change event should trigger a submit
[03:29:59] <jomofcw> Cork it appears to me to be the better way to be able to process the query on the server side then. But I could be wrong.
[03:30:19] <Cork> jomofcw: you can still process the same amount of data
[03:30:27] <Cork> you don't need to fire the submit event to do it though
[03:30:34] <Cork> (as i suspect your using ajax)
[03:30:51] <Cork> just do $(this.form).serialize() and you will get the same data
[03:31:11] <Cork> and then do a separate ajax call from the change event
[03:31:25] <jomofcw> Cork right I use ajax
[03:31:39] <Cork> (then you can even add an extra value to indicate that it isn't a normal submit so the server can know too)
[03:32:48] <jomofcw> Cork oh right ! And so in the handled ajax call, i'll add a data like "load_type":"fake_submit" or something like that and detect it on the server side... nice one !
[03:33:04] <jomofcw> Thanks a lot Cork ^^ !
[03:33:09] <Cork> well as it isn't a submit i wouldn't use that term, but ya
[03:33:27] <Cork> more like load_type: 'value update'
[03:33:30] <Cork> or something like that
[03:33:38] <jomofcw> Yea I agree, that's why I add "or something like that" :P.
[03:33:46] <jomofcw> Thanks for your help.
[03:33:49] <Cork> np
[03:34:17] <Cork> jomofcw: btw you might want to use serializeArray or serializeObject (a plugin for jquery)
[03:34:26] <Cork> else you can't do the data: {} easily
[03:35:24] <Cork> var data = $(this.form).serializeArray(); data.push([ name: 'load_type', value: 'value_update' ]); $.ajax(url, { data: data })
[03:35:34] <Cork> is how you would use serializeArray
[03:36:54] <Al_nz1> can live edit html in chrome and see changes (ie not changed on server)
[03:37:21] <Cork> Al_nz1: sure? (not sure what you're asking)
[03:38:51] <jomofcw> Cork core serializeArray would be enough, nop ? What case need serializeObject ?
[03:39:21] <Cork> jomofcw: serializeObject gives you an object of the same type you would normally write for data: {}
[03:39:46] <Al_nz1> CorkL view source. change it and have the changes reflected in the webpage
[03:39:59] <Al_nz1> like a local refresh (without going back to server)
[03:40:00] <Cork> jomofcw: so you get { <name>: <value>, <name>: <value> } instead of [{ name: '<name>', value: '<value>' }, { name: '<name>', value: '<value>' }]
[03:40:26] <Cork> Al_nz1: ya, i got that part, but what are you asking about?
[03:40:32] <Cork> if it exist? how to do it? or what?
[03:40:44] <Al_nz1> if possible?
[03:40:47] <Cork> sure
[03:40:52] <Al_nz1> how?
[03:41:10] <Cork> right click inspect
[03:41:20] <Cork> right click the element you want to edit and select "edit html"
[03:41:44] <Cork> when you focus out of the edit window the page will be updated
[03:42:07] <Cork> (this is basically how it works in all browsers as far as i remember)
[03:42:22] <Cork> not 100% sure about safari
[03:43:42] <Al_nz1> is this f12?
[03:43:53] <Cork> its in the developer tools yes
[03:44:00] <Cork> or developer console or...
[03:44:06] <Cork> (many names for the same thing)
[03:44:41] <Al_nz1> damn, maybe its the way i am serving the files
[03:44:45] <Al_nz1> but i get a blank window
[03:44:57] <Cork> that's the console
[03:45:01] <Cork> you want the element tab
[03:45:16] <Cork> (if you had right clicked the element instead you would have ended up there directly)
[03:46:03] <Cork> and no how you serve the files won't matter if it is visible it has to be in the dom
[03:46:29] <Al_nz1> ok
[03:46:30] <Al_nz1> nice
[03:46:37] <Al_nz1> working now
[03:50:44] <Al_nz1> what does the ::before and ::after mean?
[03:51:03] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before
[03:55:59] <Al_nz1> nice ok. I am just trying to be bug a dropdown inside a row, but when I added a special dropdown, it duplicated the dropdown on the row
[03:59:16] <Al_nz1> trying to work out whats going on
[03:59:22] <Al_nz1> the chrome trick is helpful
[04:05:33] <Al_nz1> Cork: the dom from browser doesnt paste well?
[04:05:38] <Al_nz1> at least not into hastebin
[04:06:22] <Cork> well, it is tag sope as far as the browser are conserned
[04:06:42] <Cork> but if you adjust the html you edit in the edit view and copy that it should be fairly ok
[04:07:05] <Al_nz1> maybe this helps: https://hastebin.com/lanisufari.xml
[04:10:10] <Al_nz1> why the heck have i got the dropdown twice???? https://snag.gy/eC6unN.jpg
[04:12:40] <Cork> Al_nz1: cause you insert it twice for some reason
[04:15:25] <Al_nz1> Cork: where?
[05:30:06] <_Justice_> isnt there a quick way to have a selector of element that contains an attribute but caring about value of it ?
[05:30:27] <_Justice_> $('.class[attribute]').something...
[05:30:27] <_Justice_> ?
[05:33:43] <_Justice_> nwm that was correct for some reason it just didnt work o.O'
[05:43:59] <Cork> [].class or .class[] both should work
[06:00:42] <rezzo> Hi, how to get the values to select --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/
[06:02:41] <Woet> rezzo: what have you tried so far?
[06:02:55] <rezzo> this --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/1/
[06:03:31] <Woet> rezzo: there is no such option in the dropbox.
[06:03:33] <Woet> dropdown *
[06:03:38] <Woet> so it cannot be selected.
[06:03:46] <rezzo> this is closer --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/2/
[06:04:48] <Woet> rezzo: thats not how you add an option to a select
[06:04:53] <rezzo> now I get all in list --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/3/
[06:05:08] <rezzo> but I need all years and month
[06:05:22] <Woet> rezzo: then add them to the HTML.
[06:16:08] <rezzo> why doesnt it add <option> --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/4/ ?
[06:19:58] <Woet> rezzo: what makes you think thats the correct way of adding an option?
[06:20:15] <Woet> rezzo: why cant you simply put the years and months in the HTML code itself?
[06:22:02] <rezzo> hmmm... yeah I could, this is easier for me at the end
[06:52:47] <__hassoon__> guys i need some help with this issue
[06:53:13] <__hassoon__> why doesn't select2() work for me, i call it on a select element, but it doesn't work
[06:53:45] <__hassoon__> not even that, it does work when i call it in the browser's code input area, i mean in firebug
[06:54:09] <__hassoon__> but when i call it in the file, it does not work
[06:54:15] <__hassoon__> this is driving me insane
[06:55:24] <__hassoon__> i wrote that, but it's not working: $('.field-contrat .new-contrat:last-child').css("border","2px solid red").find('[name^="id_statut_contrat"]').css("border","2px solid green").select2();
[06:55:55] <__hassoon__> i used the .css() to make sure that i'm on the right element, and it turned out to be right
[06:58:17] <jodeen> Quick question! Has jquery-ui lost AMD support since v1.11?
[07:01:34] <_Justice_> Any ideas why it works in chromium but not in firefox? http://jsfiddle.net/vFt5K/31/
[07:08:04] <Cork> _Justice_: it doesn't even work in all cases of blink
[07:08:13] <Cork> you want position: relative; z-index: 2;
[07:08:33] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vFt5K/35/
[07:09:19] <Cork> i would prob not use float though
[07:11:18] <Cork> _Justice_: http://jsfiddle.net/vFt5K/36/ is how i would recommending doing it
[07:11:34] <Cork> (as it doesn't require the input field to be full width)
[07:22:48] <_Justice_> Cork: hm
[09:39:27] <rezzo> how to get variable activeYear in $(".year a[title=activeYear]").addClass("myClass");
[09:49:57] <rezzo> Hi, how to check if a title contains number 2017?
[09:51:20] <rezzo> --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/10/
[09:55:49] <Cork> rezzo: i would recommend using .filter(function() { return this.title.match(/2017/) })
[09:55:55] <Cork> opps
[09:56:08] <Cork> rezzo: i would recommend using .filter(function() { return /2017/.test(this.title); })
[09:58:19] <rezzo> Cork: instead of if ($('.select-month a').indexOf(activeYear) > -1 ) {     	$(this).addClass("active");     }
[10:00:20] <Cork> rezzo: i don't get what you're trying to do down there
[10:00:29] <Cork> you unconditionally set active on line 17
[10:00:32] <rezzo> That I wanna check is to see if attribute "title" contains variable , then addClass
[10:00:36] <Cork> and then conditionally set it on line 23
[10:00:48] <Cork> but as it will always be there, why set it again?
[10:01:39] <Cork> are you thinking $(this) would be relative to the if case?
[10:04:22] <rezzo> yeah, I got the year active when clicking on it
[10:04:40] <Cork> ya, that's line 17
[10:04:43] <rezzo> so now I have to check if months has that year inside title
[10:04:45] <Cork> but line 23 sets the same thing
[10:05:28] <Cork> this only change reference in functions, not form if cases or switches or for loops or so on
[10:05:56] <rezzo> Cork: line 23 should set active class at the a tag with title="year"
[10:06:07] <rezzo> <a> tag *
[10:06:08] <Cork> *is meant to*, but ok
[10:06:32] <jomofcw> Is there a way to get the dataType of an ajax response, please ? (the one guessed by the dataType "intelligentGuess")
[10:06:55] <rezzo> Cork: ok, do you understand what Im looking for?
[10:08:01] <Cork> rezzo: https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/12/
[10:08:53] <Cork> jomofcw: are you talking about some plugin for something?
[10:09:06] <Cork> there isn't a generic dataType intelligentGuess
[10:09:20] <rezzo> Cork: oh thats exacly what I was looking for =)
[10:10:46] <rezzo> nice, now it lights red on those too =) --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/14/
[10:11:56] <jomofcw> Cork nop, core jQuery AJAX.
[10:12:28] <jomofcw> "dataType (default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html))"
[10:12:35] <jomofcw> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:13:04] <jomofcw> I would like to be able to detect if the response is JSON, and if yes, do something, if not, do something else.
[10:13:22] <Cork> heh.. wow are they calling checking the mimetype guessing...
[10:13:38] <Cork> that's insane...
[10:14:16] <Cork> jomofcw: how that works is just an object in jquery that maps the content-type header to a keyword
[10:14:27] <Cork> let me dig it up
[10:15:40] <Cork> jomofcw: $.ajaxSettings.contents
[10:15:58] <Cork> test the regex value against the content-type and if it matches it is the key
[10:17:36] <jomofcw> where do I get the content type ? From response header ?
[10:17:40] <Cork> ya
[10:17:43] <jomofcw> OK thanks ;)
[10:17:57] <Cork> xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Type')
[10:20:21] <Cork> jomofcw: if your interested https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L145
[10:22:17] <jomofcw> I give it a look, thanks !
[10:22:33] <jomofcw> find this thing interesting too : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4295386/how-can-i-check-if-a-value-is-a-json-object
[10:23:03] <Cork> ya, but that is about sniffing though, not what jquery does
[10:23:37] <Cork> and that is kida why i reacted to your original question
[10:23:42] <Cork> cause sniffing is never a good idea
[10:23:54] <Cork> simplifying mimetypes is fine

[12:10:27] <robertmaxrees> "remove custom range in datepicker" meaning?
[12:11:13] <Violinist> does thsi look rite?
[12:11:14] <Violinist> .daterangepicker.ranges ul li:last-child
[12:11:39] <Violinist> $(".daterangepicker.ranges ul li:last-child")
[12:12:08] <robertmaxrees> that's how you select an element - still trying to understand your original question.
[12:12:11] <Violinist> ok got it
[12:12:11] <Violinist> $(".daterangepicker .ranges ul li:last-child").hide();
[12:12:22] <robertmaxrees> that just hides them fwiw.
[12:13:20] <Violinist> yeah i know
[12:13:24] <Violinist> theres no other way
[12:13:33] <robertmaxrees> to do what?
[12:13:41] <robertmaxrees> like, can you clarify your question?
[12:17:44] <MikeD_> Violinist: it's going to depend on what datepicker you're using
[12:18:17] <Violinist> umm okay lol

[13:17:42] <Al_nz1> Hi All
[13:17:52] <Al_nz1> I have a function that adds rows to my form
[13:18:13] <Al_nz1> but I need to increment - for the moment the id on the first select picker
[13:18:15] <Al_nz1> https://hastebin.com/enofojetav.http
[13:18:22] <Al_nz1> anyone able to assist please?
[13:21:07] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: grab the ID and change it?
[13:21:32] <Al_nz1> NoiseEee: yes - how is the question. Im looking at : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/347798/changing-an-elements-id-with-jquery
[13:22:04] <NoiseEee> newRow.find('#statscode0').first().attr('id','#statscode'+someNumberYouHaveFiguredOutBasedOnHowManyHaveBeenClonedSoFar)
[13:23:31] <Al_nz1> NoiseEee: yeah pretty close to the SO answer. Whats this first/prev? stuff?
[13:23:42] <Al_nz1> first being first instance of?
[13:23:58] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: when you're .find()- ing something, you always get a collection in return
[13:24:02] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: indeed
[13:25:16] <Al_nz1> makes perfect sense
[13:29:11] <NoiseEee> just do that before you append it, obv
[13:29:48] <Al_nz1> For once my (your!) code seems to be working as intended without too much error!
[13:30:21] <Al_nz1> Is there a way to select all id=statscode[x]
[13:30:51] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: well, there's only supposed to ever be one ID of anything in a document right?
[13:31:03] <Al_nz1> yes
[13:31:10] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: but... if you gave them all a class of "statscode" for example, taht would be an easy way to round them all up
[13:32:01] <Al_nz1> so change this : <select class="selectpicker form-control" id="statscode0" data-live-search="true" title="Type first 3 characters">
[13:32:04] <Al_nz1> to something like
[13:32:11] <Al_nz1> <select class="selectpicker form-control stats" id="statscode0" data-live-search="true" title="Type first 3 characters">
[13:32:22] <Al_nz1> then I can select on class stats ?
[13:33:29] <NoiseEee> yep
[13:33:36] <NoiseEee> even select.class to make the browser do less work
[13:37:03] <Al_nz1> brilliant
[13:37:08] <Al_nz1> just brilliant
[13:37:09] <Al_nz1> thanks
[13:37:36] <Al_nz1> I dont think my naming convention is very good though in the class
[13:37:58] <Al_nz1> how about selectpicker form-control statsCodepicker ?
[13:38:11] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: np, good luck. and usually when I see an ID like "something1" or "something0" I question the need for the ID in the first place
[13:38:27] <NoiseEee> Al_nz1: whatever makes sense to you, just be consistent
[13:38:34] <Al_nz1> ok
[13:45:00] <Al_nz1> NoiseEee: ok - sorry one more thing. As I add each new row, I need some other code to be run. https://hastebin.com/bubelozepe.php - this is currently in docready - but needs to be called each time I add a row?
[13:45:23] <Al_nz1> do I just wrap it all in a function?
[13:45:41] <Al_nz1> then call that during add row?
[13:48:45] <robertmaxrees> how else would you handle that Al_nz1?
[13:49:16] <Al_nz1> well - in the interests of learning I just had a go at it myself.....
[13:49:24] <Al_nz1> just working out the error
[13:49:29] <Al_nz1> something about
[13:49:44] <Al_nz1> annot instantiate an AjaxBootstrapSelect instance without selectpicker first being initialized!
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> what do you think that error means?
[13:52:20] <Al_nz1> I need to inistalise selectpicker - but I dont understand how its initalised, or when
[13:54:54] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/truckingsim/Ajax-Bootstrap-Select/issues/108
[13:58:03] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: i read that - but didnt see a answer?

[14:01:27] <ericP> ideas?
[14:02:40] <robertmaxrees> check your console.
[14:05:16] <ericP> the unexpected "<"?
[14:05:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:05:48] <ericP> any idea what that's about?
[14:06:03] <ericP> them html being echo'd back looks ok
[14:06:03] <robertmaxrees> are you getting that on your site?
[14:07:11] <ericP> in real life, i'm just getting the issue where the jQuery("<html>...") gives me back a selection of the title and the items under <body>
[14:07:38] <ericP> which is what i'm seeing here as well (you can change the selector to "*" to see that)
[14:08:42] <ericP> so the jsfiddle emulates my issue (can find 2nd level p but not top-level div) plus gives me an extra "<" issue which i can't explain
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> ah, probably becuase you're returning that as JS
[14:17:28] <robertmaxrees> ericP https://jsfiddle.net/73ygfz74/3/
[14:17:51] <robertmaxrees> this fixes the error.
[14:23:20] <devslash> is it possible to use jquery to disable a button so click events are ignored
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> .prop('disabled', true) should do that.
[14:24:08] <devslash> its not working
[14:24:14] <devslash> thts the first thing i tried
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sy7wmpq5/
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> oh and he quit already
[14:26:32] <ericP> robertmaxrees, tx for fixing the error
[14:26:46] <ericP> any ideas for how to get find("div")?
[14:27:17] <robertmaxrees> ericP newp.  i seem to recall that working just fine, but I have no idea why it's returning mutliple elements for that jquery call.
[14:28:10] <robertmaxrees> though most cases i've seen that, it's using .load().
[14:28:12] <ericP> i could construct a DOM tree, find the body, and copy the contents into a new element, but that seems a big hackish
[14:28:44] <ericP> yeah, load does fine with it but it turns out i don't wnat to stick it into an element (likely to have id conflicts)
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> you can use load just like .ajax()
[14:29:09] <robertmaxrees> with a .then()
[14:29:10] <robertmaxrees> last i checked.
[14:29:38] <ericP> load automagically adds it to an element, right?
[14:30:08] <devslash> is this thre right way to trigger a change event on a text field ? $("#createaccountusername").change(function(e) {
[14:30:09] <ericP> maybe i can make a fresh jquery object with no ids in it and load it into that
[14:30:22] <devslash> i put an alert in there and its not executing
[14:36:51] <robertmaxrees> devslash are you dynamically creating that element?
[14:37:03] <devslash> no
[14:37:03] <robertmaxrees> are you rem,embering to docready that code or put it before the closing body tag?>
[14:37:20] <devslash> yea i think i fixed it just a sec
[15:27:20] <pila> hey i want to live update some numbers in a dashboard, and i would have that "flashy" effect when a number updates. does somebody know where i can find something like that?
[15:29:20] <janemba> jo
[15:29:24] <janemba> hi
[15:31:44] <qbert> hey guys, why so quitet ?
[15:32:26] <robertmaxrees> people are probably busy.
[15:40:41] <janemba> I'm using bxslider jquery plugin. It works fine but I would like to do something different. Is it possible to request each image each a click on arrow is done ?
[15:42:04] <MikeD_> $el.attr('type');  <-- should this be .prop() instead of .attr() now?
[16:06:26] <magi3> hey  - I've been developing a site at https://www.domain.com, but users can also navigate to https://domain.com, and the site still renders (from GET), and SSL works.  Ajax POSTs from browsers that loaded the naked domain differ in headers in four ways: no" X-Requested-With" header, no cookie, but adding in "Origin", and has the naked domain as the "Referer".  I understand that his might...
[16:06:27] <magi3> ...technically be cross domain, so is there a way this is usually handled?
[16:07:12] <magi3> *Handled from the client side, such that cookies are set, etc.
[16:07:37] <robertmaxrees> not client-side.  that's server-side stuff.
[16:07:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd just redirect users to always go to www.
[16:10:18] <magi3> @ robertmaxress thanks, then.
[16:14:20] <fooman2011> Hello. I'm using input type number fields. Could you please tell me if there is an easy way to format the numbers with thousand separator ?
[16:17:41] <robertmaxrees> fooman2011 because they're numbers, you can't change the format.
[16:17:55] <robertmaxrees> if you want to display them differently, you have some limited options.
[16:18:08] <fooman2011> And if I use a text instead
[16:18:17] <robertmaxrees> then you can have your separator
[16:18:33] <fooman2011> Could you tell me how to do this ?
[16:18:46] <robertmaxrees> tons of tutorials out on the web that explain it.
[16:19:23] <fooman2011> without using plugin ?
[16:20:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy stuff.
[16:20:06] <fooman2011> ??
[16:20:11] <robertmaxrees> what?
[16:20:46] <fooman2011> I'm searching since 4 hours and I found nothing. All examples are using an external plugin.
[16:20:59] <fooman2011> What keywords are you using for the search ?
[16:21:01] <robertmaxrees> you're probably searching with the word "jquery"
[16:21:15] <robertmaxrees> javascript format number thousands
[16:22:00] <fooman2011> oh yeah sure there are a lot of tuto for this but my question is "how to branch this format code to the jquery component ?"
[16:22:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:22:16] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to "branch" anything.
[16:22:50] <fooman2011> how to display the formated number value inside the input text ?
[16:23:00] <robertmaxrees> .val(theFormattedNumber)
[16:23:08] <fooman2011> first I have to listen input change right ?
[16:23:30] <robertmaxrees> now you're asking a different question :)
[16:24:00] <fooman2011> my question is only about the display
[16:24:06] <robertmaxrees> "first I have to listen input
[16:24:06] <robertmaxrees> change right ?
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> heh that question seems to be about how to bind an event listener.
[16:25:17] <fooman2011> what event listener to use, change ? keyup ?  I'm looking for the easiest way to have a input field that is like an Excel cell with a specific format.
[16:25:29] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19470499/how-to-format-input-box-text-as-i-am-typing-it
[16:25:35] <robertmaxrees> this should have some good answers for you.
[16:26:15] <fooman2011> yeah thanks :)
[16:29:53] <Es0teric> if i have a click and its inside of a <p><a>, how do i get the parent of <p> ?
[16:30:42] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() to select it.
[16:41:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ahh yes... .closest('section') did it for me
[17:06:07] <fooman2011> Is it possible to override the val method only for one component ? All examples seems to override the JQuery.val method. There is only one val method for all components ?
[17:06:40] <robertmaxrees> fooman2011 what do youi mean by "component"?
[17:07:44] <fooman2011> I mean I have an 7 input text. One of them has id="foo". I would like to override the val method for "foo" only
[17:07:54] <fooman2011> component is input text
[17:08:07] <robertmaxrees> So you mean for a specific jquery object.
[17:08:15] <fooman2011> yes
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> try $theSavedObject.val = function() {}
[17:08:39] <robertmaxrees> though overriding core jquery methods is something to avoid imo.
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> why do you want that?
[17:09:36] <panovia> You can check the ID of $(this) in the handler and do something else if tit matches that foo one
[17:09:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:09:47] <panovia> *it :s
[17:10:16] <fooman2011> because as you know when the use press keys to write text in the input I reformat it. As instance the use enter "1000000" and I reformat it "1 000 000". But when i get the value i woule like to have "1000000" and not "1 000 000".
[17:10:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, do that explicitly in your handler.
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> instead of implicitly by overriding a method,.
[17:10:49] <fooman2011> ?
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> what are you stuck on there?
[17:11:35] <fooman2011> when the user call val to get the value I need to "unformat" the string
[17:12:08] <robertmaxrees> you want to convert it to a number
[17:12:25] <fooman2011> I want to return the "original value"
[17:12:31] <robertmaxrees> *the number
[17:12:36] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[17:12:40] <fooman2011> yes, the value, before formating
[17:12:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't exist unless you save it somewhere.
[17:13:32] <robertmaxrees> so you either need to explicitly strip/format or store the number in a spot that'll persist/.
[17:25:11] <fooman2011> it's ok
[17:25:15] <fooman2011> thanks for your help
[17:26:38] <robertmaxrees> figure it out?
[18:13:05] <halfcab123> Shoky: I finally got the solution lol
[18:13:57] <halfcab123> It's because I was using client side templating within server side templating I have to escape the mustaches
[18:14:45] <halfcab123> So they were getting removed on server side before they hit the client -___-
[18:22:17] <taplar_> aww, fooman left
[18:23:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:23:59] <taplar_> i was gonna suggest a data element
[18:58:46] <robertmaxrees> today is one of those days that makes me wonder why the let me use computers.
[19:00:26] <taplar_> lol
[19:14:51] <halfcab123> shoky: matter of fact, I didn't even have to escape the mustaches, I could simply load the template from an external file
[22:32:27] <Alturic> Hey guys, is there anyway to "gather" what if condition failed? So something like if (!event_type || !event_start) { console.log('the condition(s) that failed'); } ?
[22:33:23] <Alturic> event_type and event_start are var's pointing to .val()'s
[23:18:24] <ezio> is there some type of event associated with navigation to an anchor tag?
