[00:07:14] <geri> i have a function in js which returns: return {         latitude: latitude + (offsetLatitude * (180 / Math.PI)),         longitude: longitude + (offsetLongitude * (180 / Math.PI))     } ...... how can i access the latitude of the object?
[00:07:31] <geri> oh wrong chan
[04:31:15] <d3m0n> I have a css animation loader that spins, when it finishes loading I remove it via jquery. Is it possible to have it land exactly where it started including the loading time?
[04:31:57] <d3m0n> Eg. it might add 0.1-0.5s to the load just so i can complete the animation
[06:10:32] <uskerine> exit
[06:10:34] <uskerine> quit
[06:30:43] <Yatekii> https://jsfiddle.net/Yatekii/b2Ls8c0L/22/ any idea why my click does not work on the mailbox items? :S
[06:30:47] <R13ose> Code: http://pastebin.com/zrQHAJax This is applying the class active for all the a tags.  How do I make this apply for one section at a time when I scroll?
[06:38:52] <R13ose> Yatekii: If you remove active from the mailbox.active.item, that works for me.  Also if you want to use this on all items, you have to use a class or id higher then mailbox.
[06:39:33] <Yatekii> why higher than mailbox?
[06:40:30] <Yatekii> R13ose: does not work for me with removed .active. and even if. that would make the whole line pointless :D
[06:41:23] <R13ose> Yatekii: what do you want to happen?  If you only want the mailbox item to have the class active then this is fine but if you want to do this for all of them then you need to go higher.
[06:41:24] <m1su> you don't have a mailbox class on the inactive items
[06:41:41] <m1su> so $('a.mailbox.item').click wont work on those
[06:42:19] <R13ose> yep
[06:42:29] <Yatekii> m1su: i know but it doesn't work on the active one either
[06:42:42] <Yatekii> so no point on fixing the other stuff if the important part doesn't work.
[06:44:27] <R13ose> Yatekii: You are removing and then adding back at the same time.
[06:44:37] <Yatekii> ok I see it now
[06:45:00] <Yatekii> orry guys, I suk
[06:45:03] <Yatekii> ty!
[06:45:20] <Yatekii> R13ose: I was confused because it didn't rint either.
[06:45:22] <Yatekii> *print
[06:45:25] <R13ose> :P
[06:45:32] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[06:45:34] <Yatekii> but I guess I never tried clicking on the active one
[06:46:02] <Yatekii> sorry, as you have seen I aint got no clue what I am doing :S
[06:51:52] <jac0bz1> Hello! I made this small plugin that adds an class and remove it again when the elements is done animating.. http://pastebin.com/qDe22NPb Problem is, if I for instance  whant to show a div with an show animation and close animation, it will fire both animations, since i attach my plugin to the same element twice. Any way I can unbind my plugin after the animation ends?
[07:07:12] <R13ose> jac0bz1: jsfiddle for that would be good
[07:34:25] <R13ose> Code: http://pastebin.com/fX8fijMU  This is applying the class active for all the li tags.  How do I make this apply for one section at a time when I scroll?
[08:30:59] <Jordy> Having the javascript and HTML parts in jsfiddle, then clicking save/run makes the page loading never finish aka infinite loop.
[08:31:00] <Jordy> http://pastebin.com/2JiQRTf9
[08:31:04] <Jordy> How can I fix that?
[08:38:02] <AdamPDotty> You should not reuse i in the inner loop.
[08:39:50] <Jordy> AdamPDotty, do you give unique names to your loop integer variables? if yes, example?
[08:40:12] <AdamPDotty> lazy variation: start with i then j k ...
[08:40:45] <AdamPDotty> full version: buttonGroupIndex and buttonIndex
[08:42:30] <Jordy> thx
[08:50:26] <decx> use a higher order function instead
[09:12:36] <jazi> hello
[09:13:04] <jazi> what is the difference between   base.$el = $(el);     and  base.el = el;
[09:13:06] <jazi> ?
[09:14:28] <jazi> reference link is https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/difference-between-jquery-object-and-dom-element/
[09:14:47] <prohobo> does anyone know how to get a slideUp effect without the inner elements shrinking? https://jsfiddle.net/e03unp4c/
[09:14:51] <prohobo> also hello :P
[09:17:03] <decx> add a class with 0 height and overflow hidden instead of using outdated animation methods
[09:18:52] <jazi> prohobo https://jsfiddle.net/e03unp4c/4/
[09:19:19] <decx> no
[09:19:23] <prohobo> lol
[09:19:54] <prohobo> decx you mean with a transition attr?
[09:20:15] <prohobo> like height: 0; overflow: hidden; transition: 0.6s height;?
[09:20:23] <prohobo> 1 second
[09:21:50] <prohobo> GOD DAMN IT I AHD IT
[09:21:56] <AdamPDotty> jazi: $(el) is a jQuerySet containing that element, el is the element
[09:23:01] <decx> dont use that plugin generator
[09:26:36] <neo12> why is formData remain after the append ? "console.log" gives me an empty object - formData.append('file', $file, $file.name);console.log(formData);
[09:29:19] <AdamPDotty> >> var formData= []; formData.append('file', $file, $file.name);console.log(formData);
[09:30:03] <neo12> i already have var formData = new FormData();
[09:31:17] <decx> what are these extra arguments in append supposed to be
[09:31:36] <neo12> file and name
[09:31:39] <decx> also you append to a node not an array
[09:31:42] <neo12> actual file and name
[09:31:48] <decx> no
[09:31:53] <decx> append takes a node or string
[09:32:40] <decx> so it's an error trifecta
[09:32:40] <neo12>  var $file = $("#userfile")[0].files[0];
[09:32:58] <neo12> thats what i have
[09:33:03] <decx> doesnt matter
[09:33:14] <decx> append doesnt work like that on either side
[09:33:16] <neo12> should it be $("#userfile")?
[09:33:24] <decx> not on arrays and not with extra arguments
[09:33:43] <neo12> do you have url?
[09:54:05] <EdwardIII> hey i need to embed my code in another page that already has jquery and a bunch of other stuff
[09:54:18] <EdwardIII> pretty sure noConflict won't help here as they use jQuery not $ for their calls
[09:54:26] <EdwardIII> what's a sane approach?
[10:00:43] <jrockjiggz> EdwardIII: I always did something like var $$$ = jQuery.noConflict();  then $$$(function($){ /*Use normal $ in here*/ });  or i guess you could use jQuery(function($){ /* use $ here too */});
[10:01:11] <decx> just wrap it in an iife
[10:01:45] <EdwardIII> jrockjiggz: i think the problem is the other way around though, my jQuery is breaking their jQuery
[10:02:08] <decx> iife
[10:02:40] <prohobo> iife
[10:03:18] <jrockjiggz> EdwardIII: have your jquery load before their scripts
[10:03:23] <EdwardIII> but iife will still leave their code broken right? mine will work, but when they try and do like jQuery.some_weird_plugin they'll get undefined because it's referring to my jQuery object, not theirs
[10:03:36] <EdwardIII> jrockjiggz: well that's the problem, it does, then it breaks their code
[10:03:50] <decx> but they already load jquery?
[10:04:01] <jrockjiggz> why would you load jquery twice
[10:06:36] <EdwardIII> my app is like a general thing, the site it's being embedded into might be weird old version or do something stupid like break .load
[10:06:54] <EdwardIII> in this instance they have a fairly decent version but i don't think removing jQuery from the main app's build is going to be practical
[10:09:08] <jrockjiggz> var $jq = jQuery.noConflict();
[10:09:34] <jrockjiggz> jQuerry.noConflict() // Give $ back to script; create new alias to jQuery.
[10:10:06] <EdwardIII> but the other global jQuery object will remain overriden, right? the one called jQuery
[10:10:15] <decx> what
[10:10:22] <decx> just dont load another one
[10:10:26] <decx> what's so hard to get about that
[10:11:41] <jrockjiggz> var oldJQuery = $; /* load new jquery */; var $$$ = jQuery.noConflict();  var $=oldJQuery;
[10:12:13] <jrockjiggz> scratch that
[10:12:24] <prohobo> i swear to god ima punch this fiddle in the dick
[10:12:56] <jrockjiggz> var oldJQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); /*load new*/; newJquery = jQuery.noConflict();   now you have the two;  oldJquery, newJquery
[10:13:52] <momomo> if i do <a onclick... and someone uses the keyboard to tab to the link and presses enter .. it won't fire, right ?
[10:14:02] <momomo> is there another event that will do both ?
[10:15:39] <jrockjiggz> momomo: what event are you trying to capture
[10:15:50] <jrockjiggz> onFocus?
[10:15:51] <decx> click will catch this just fine
[10:16:21] <momomo> jrockjiggz, no, i have a link that onclick does soemthing .. but the user might also use enter to navigate
[10:16:43] <decx> works just fine
[10:16:51] <jrockjiggz> momomo: the user might use enter to navigate??
[10:16:52] <decx> click is a ctachall
[10:16:59] <prohobo> click is: mouse click, keyboard activation, or finger tap
[10:17:00] <momomo> decx, yes, it seems so
[10:17:25] <momomo> i thought it didnt
[10:17:56] <prohobo> this gets slightly more tricky if you have an input and a fake submit button
[10:18:09] <prohobo> then you have to actually catch the keypress
[10:18:11] <decx> no really
[10:18:17] <decx> not
[10:19:12] <prohobo> well you have to catch the keyboard press, find the input that is currently focused, then trigger click on its related button
[10:19:29] <decx> that would be ridiculous
[10:19:36] <prohobo> how would you do it then
[10:19:49] <decx> enter on a form submits it
[10:19:57] <prohobo> we're not talking about a form
[10:20:11] <prohobo> just a form-like input and button
[10:20:11] <decx> then you dont get html if you use inputs outside of forms
[10:20:36] <prohobo> what if you have a multistage clientside workflow
[10:20:52] <decx> bunch of bs
[10:20:59] <prohobo> lol
[10:21:45] <prohobo> im sorry decx
[10:57:26] <crockstylie> Hi, I want to toggle check my checkbox on wrapper click.
[10:57:27] <crockstylie> https://jsfiddle.net/6fpmpbuc/
[10:57:40] <crockstylie> It doesn't work, I can't find out why ^^"
[11:02:29] <rgman> crockstylie: It's because the click event is linked with the cell that holds de checkbox input. I'm guessing you want to toggle when the label is clicked.
[11:03:05] <rgman> I think it's better if you use the <label> element instead.
[11:05:47] <crockstylie> rgman, it's a simplified table for testing purpose, but in my final table there is no label.
[11:09:50] <theeboat> Hi, I'm using a bootstrap table with a checkbox in one of the fields. I am using jquery to read the checked boxes then prompting the user to confirm they wish to delete the items they've selected. This then triggers another function performing the deletion. The problem that I am having is that when the user does this multiple times it takes the rows they had selected previously and tries to delete this also. http://jsbin.com/canexa
[11:10:17] <theeboat> I am fairly new to javascript and jquery so will take any criticism and advise. Thanks
[11:11:01] <bango2> theeboat, what should i be putting in the popup boxes
[11:14:38] <bango2> theeboat, i dont think the link you referenced us is relevant to your problem
[11:14:45] <theeboat> I'm using the bootstrap modal to prompt the user to confirm whether or not they wish to delete the items displayed which is basically looping through all the rows in the table which have had a checkbox selected.
[11:15:41] <bango2> theeboat, can you give us some code for reference
[11:15:50] <bango2> otherwise we cant really help you
[11:24:50] <theeboat> bango2, http://jsbin.com/canexakowe/edit?html,js,output i've updated this with some more code
[11:30:19] <DjBonadoobie> theeboat: i may be missing something... but there's no html elements in the body for the supply js/jq to act upon in that bin
[11:35:08] <bango2> theeboat DjBonadoobie is right. We can't really test this on anything, we cant even see the relevant logs
[11:37:22] <theeboat> Sorry, my session crashed and it recreated another one. http://jsbin.com/rezinutifi/1/edit?html,js,output What are you referring to when you say the relevant logs?
[11:41:52] <bango2> the console logs
[11:42:00] <bango2> but looks like we have what we need now
[11:44:25] <theeboat> no probs
[11:55:18] <R13ose> How do I remove the active class in li's after the page loads?  code: http://pastebin.com/t7hZLtXL
[11:56:19] <bango2> theeboat i dont know how to help you. i dont have access to the deleteRoute function, so i can't recreate the issue youre having in the first place.
[11:56:43] <robertmaxrees> R13ose uh, by removing it?
[11:57:38] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: how?  My code doesn't remove the active class.
[11:57:48] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're targeting the correct elements.
[11:59:39] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I thought I am.
[11:59:41] <DjBonadoobie> R13ose $('#cb-main-menu ul li') you're already calling an id with #cb-main-menu, so the ul li should be unnecessary unless that's not the element you want... are you wanting some of the children of $('#cb-main-menu)?
[12:02:02] <R13ose> DjBonadoobie: There are 5 li's and I want to call all of them expect the first one.  These are children of #cb-main-menu.
[12:02:51] <DjBonadoobie> ok, so then you should maybe try $('#cb-main-menu > ul > li').not(':first').removeClass("active");
[12:03:23] <DjBonadoobie> ">" moves through to the specified children of the #cb-main-menu
[12:05:20] <R13ose> DjBonadoobie: still not removing the class.
[12:05:31] <robertmaxrees> R13ose show us your html
[12:05:35] <robertmaxrees> make a quick fiddle
[12:05:42] <DjBonadoobie> that^
[12:05:50] <R13ose> Can I pm one of you?
[12:05:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:05:56] <robertmaxrees> share it to the channel.
[12:06:00] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be anything private.
[12:06:47] <DjBonadoobie> all you need is the snippet of the affected area. don't need the entire html
[12:06:57] <theeboat> bango2 i've placed the deleteRoute function in, all this does is request a cgi script via ajax. http://jsbin.com/huyowexeka/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:11:31] <R13ose> This is working now.
[12:11:45] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue, then?
[12:13:44] <R13ose> The issue was not using >'s
[12:14:25] <robertmaxrees> so too many li elements were getting the class removed?
[12:15:15] <DjBonadoobie> he was just focusing on the element with the id #cb-main-menu, wasn't traversing dom to get to correct elements
[12:15:48] <robertmaxrees> except $('#cb-main-menu ul li') would get you all ancestor LIs under there.
[12:15:55] <robertmaxrees> were there nested lists or something?
[12:16:44] <bango2> sense is not made lol
[12:16:55] <R13ose> the li elements were getting removed but I needed multiple classes to be removed as they were doing the same thing.
[12:17:04] <robertmaxrees> this still isn't making sense.
[12:17:17] <robertmaxrees> i really don't understand why people are cryptic and secretive about their markup.
[12:17:19] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[12:19:33] <R13ose> I needed to do this $('#cb-main-menu > ul > li').removeClass('current-menu-item current_page_item'); ontop of the line to remove the active class.
[12:19:54] <robertmaxrees> there we go - so you also needed to remove other classes.  active wasn't the only issue.
[12:20:15] <R13ose> the active line was because I was missing the >'s
[12:22:34] <robertmaxrees> aaaand not making sense agin.
[12:22:36] <robertmaxrees> *again
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> lol good luck :)
[12:23:20] <R13ose> I needed to put in this '#cb-main-menu > ul > li' instead of '#cb-main-menu  ul  li'
[12:23:33] <robertmaxrees> except the latter should still have worked.
[12:24:02] <bango2> yes > only narrows the scope. without the > youd still have all elements fall under that scope, plus maybe ones you dont want
[12:24:19] <robertmaxrees> > is just "direct descendents"
[12:51:41] <codecutter> log is giving me "function next() { [native code] }" http://pastebin.com/wEwn70XL
[12:52:59] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the keys of the formData object?
[12:53:06] <codecutter> yes
[12:53:22] <codecutter> formdata https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/keys
[12:53:31] <robertmaxrees> so .keys() returns an iterator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols
[12:53:36] <robertmaxrees> that's an ES6 feature.
[12:53:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't use $.each() on those.
[12:54:09] <codecutter> how about for loop?
[12:54:14] <codecutter> will that work?
[12:54:53] <robertmaxrees> you have to use a particular kind of for loop.
[12:55:24] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're treading in pretty unsupported territory right now.
[12:55:28] <robertmaxrees> no IE support at all.
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> or safari.

[12:55:56] <codecutter> i need to process a form via ajax
[12:56:05] <robertmaxrees> "process" or send?
[12:56:16] <codecutter> send
[12:56:34] <robertmaxrees> then just serialize the form
[12:56:38] <codecutter> i have an upload file
[12:56:50] <codecutter> so its like a multipart form
[12:57:11] <robertmaxrees> so you want to upload a file AND formdata?
[12:57:20] <codecutter> except upload inut file is not inside the form
[12:57:29] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[12:57:30] <codecutter> ats input field*
[12:57:53] <codecutter> i suppose i can place it inside
[12:58:01] <codecutter> thats not a problem

[13:55:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't want formData.
[13:55:11] <robertmaxrees> i don't know why you keep using that - it's not supported in IE at all.
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> at least, not in the ways you need it to be.

[13:58:38] <codecutter> i get no complaints
[13:58:51] <robertmaxrees> ?

[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> var $form = this.select('postForm'); ?
[13:59:26] <codecutter> thats frameword stuff
[13:59:29] <codecutter> thats not it

[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> dunno then..
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see a fiddle.
[14:00:11] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[14:00:13] <codecutter> nvm
[14:00:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:01:02] <codecutter> nevermind :)
[14:01:08] <robertmaxrees> heh okay?
[14:01:16] <codecutter> nope

[16:39:38] <mtree> no problem, sorry just tried to make sure we are on the right direction. I want to match words starting with given string
[16:40:04] <robertmaxrees> so "volks" would match "Volkswagen is in blue color"
[16:40:20] <mtree> yes
[16:40:32] <mtree> but "olks" won't match anything
[16:40:34] <robertmaxrees> what about "vol blu" ?  would that have to match as well?
[16:41:03] <mtree> yes, that should match "Volkswagen bla bla" and "Volvo is bla bla"
[16:41:04] <robertmaxrees> because if not, it's a super simple thing to do.
[16:41:13] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[16:41:32] <mtree> check array contents, first el and last one
[16:41:36] <robertmaxrees> "vol blue" should match "Volkswagen bla bla" ? or "Volkswagen is in blue color"
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> please be explicit and clear - that's all i'm asking, yo.
[16:41:58] <mtree> both contains words starting with "vol" and "blu"
[16:42:05] <mtree> so they should be matched
[16:42:08] <robertmaxrees> eep.
[16:42:53] <robertmaxrees> would it matter if it were out of order?  so it "vol blu" could match "blue volkswagen" ?
[16:43:12] <mtree> no it should not matter
[16:43:40] <mtree> so in perfect solution "vol blu" matches "blue volkswagen" :)
[16:43:45] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:43:48] <mtree> sorry for me being so enigmatic
[16:43:53] <mtree> im not native speaker
[16:44:01] <mtree> and i'm just starting to learn programming
[16:44:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably split the words into an array and test to see if each of the search terms match the beginnings of words in the available results.
[16:44:36] <robertmaxrees> instead of using a regex.
[16:45:42] <mtree> so first of all we split by "spaces" everything, array of potential search results and search string
[16:46:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:46:27] <mtree> haha, i don't think I understand
[16:46:42] <mtree> can you please provide me some sort of example?
[16:46:51] <robertmaxrees> i'll guide you in fixing this ;)
[16:47:01] <mtree> thanks
[16:47:32] <robertmaxrees> so I might start by splitting the search term into an array and storing that in a var.
[16:47:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd split on spaces.
[16:49:10] <mtree> done
[16:50:03] <robertmaxrees> so now I'd filter the manufacurers against the search terms - something like manufactirers.filter(function(currentManufacturer) {})
[16:50:42] <robertmaxrees> in that, i'd split the current one and use array.every()
[16:50:48] <robertmaxrees> that part I'll help you with heh
[16:52:03] <robertmaxrees> understand the basic idea though?
[16:52:43] <mtree> yes, I think so
[16:58:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/yLdn3/242/
[17:09:11] <mtree> thats great!
[17:10:07] <mtree> there's one issue though, query string should only match beginnings of particular words
[17:10:17] <robertmaxrees> easy
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> change that indeoxOf
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> to be === 0 instead of > -1
[17:12:31] <mtree> this is great
[17:12:48] <mtree> thank you veryt much
[18:23:08] <anom> Don't suppose anyone knows how i'd rewrite this without the jquery? 				clearTimeout($.data(this, 'scrollTimer'));
[18:23:22] <anom> the $.data() part, I can't figure out what that even is.
[18:23:28] <anom> It's nothing to do with the data- attribute
[18:23:38] <robertmaxrees> it's a private api
[18:23:47] <robertmaxrees> well, kind of.
[18:23:47] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> i was thinking of $._data
[18:25:33] <anom> mmm
[18:25:54] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[18:26:39] <anom> Been asked to remove jquery from a site that I didn't even make, and I'm just stumped how to rewrite this part with the $.data()
[18:26:54] <robertmaxrees> find another place to store information.
[18:27:17] <jphase> localStorage is an option
[18:27:26] <robertmaxrees> not one that you need here though,.
[18:27:52] <robertmaxrees> just create an object in a scope you can access when these get created/cleared.
[18:34:22] <jphase> Can anyone see any noob mistakes or reason why my method isn't firing and displaying 'test' in the console here?  https://jsfiddle.net/jphase/ubmay4ty/
[18:34:36] <robertmaxrees> other than the console error?
[18:34:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:35:22] <jphase> well that's what I'm trying to identify actually
[18:35:33] <robertmaxrees> don't use latest - use a numbered version: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ubmay4ty/1/
[18:35:47] <robertmaxrees> latest isn't guaranteed to be a functional release.
[18:35:59] <jphase> oh, nice - thx robertmaxrees
[18:36:03] <jphase> :)
[18:36:09] <robertmaxrees> fshosho
[19:22:09] <fredoman> hi there!
[19:22:17] <robertmaxrees> hello
[19:22:29] <fredoman> i know you robertmaxrees :D
[19:22:36] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[19:22:41] <fredoman> is the 3 or 4th time I am reading your nick
[19:22:47] <robertmaxrees> hah, fair enough.
[19:22:48] <fredoman> :)
[19:23:04] <fredoman> hahaha
[19:23:28] <fredoman> I am playing with jquery and I am getting crazy
[19:23:39] <fredoman> i have a jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/08pqg0hk/
[19:24:05] <fredoman> somebody could help me?
[19:24:15] <robertmaxrees> where's your javascript?
[19:24:28] <robertmaxrees> ask your question.  if somebody can help, they will.
[19:24:53] <fredoman> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[19:25:00] <fredoman> well, I have a html structure
[19:25:07] <fredoman> i know some details
[19:25:08] <robertmaxrees> as seen there.
[19:25:29] <fredoman> and i need to get an specific ID what is generated by a weird process
[19:25:45] <fredoman> i tried to comment them on the jsfiddle
[19:26:06] <robertmaxrees> why do you need it?
[19:26:16] <robertmaxrees> like, can you clarify what you're appending?
[19:26:32] <fredoman> i need to append a div
[19:26:50] <robertmaxrees> what does it have to do with the ID, i mean?
[19:26:57] <fredoman>   <div id="randomID_1_container" class="randomID_container"></div>     is a container for many elements
[19:27:45] <robertmaxrees> can you flesh out the fiddle a bit more with where you'll have multiple elements?
[19:27:51] <fredoman> wait a second, I commit a mistake on the jsfiddle, here is the new version
[19:27:52] <fredoman> https://jsfiddle.net/08pqg0hk/1/
[19:28:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, still need a more fleshed out example.
[19:28:49] <robertmaxrees> like, are there multiple <div id="randomID"> elements?
[19:29:07] <fredoman> here is the new version for the jsfiddle
[19:29:07] <fredoman> https://jsfiddle.net/08pqg0hk/2/
[19:29:09] <robertmaxrees> and then multiple <div id="randomID_1_container" class="some_container"></div> in each of those?  if so, are there any available classes?
[19:29:33] <fredoman> now I feel that is better explained inside the jsfiddle
[19:29:43] <robertmaxrees> not quite.
[19:29:46] <fredoman> is it clear?
[19:29:52] <robertmaxrees> are there multiple <div id="randomID">s?
[19:30:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/08pqg0hk/3/
[19:30:16] <robertmaxrees> like this?
[19:32:15] <fredoman> affirmative, now I update it: https://jsfiddle.net/08pqg0hk/4/
[19:32:41] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want the some_containers?
[19:33:20] <robertmaxrees> $('.some_container').each(function() { var theId = this.id });
[19:34:09] <fredoman> correct, but i need the '.some_container' that is under #myParameter
[19:34:21] <fredoman> because there are more .some_container under other divs
[19:34:25] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[19:34:32] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think you'd do?
[19:34:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/08pqg0hk/5/ <- with jquery added btw
[19:36:16] <fredoman> i need just the first one, is it possible>
[19:36:17] <fredoman> ?
[19:36:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:36:30] <robertmaxrees> show me what you know so far.
[19:36:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:37:16] <fredoman> ok, one second :)
[19:39:38] <fredoman> sweet!
[19:39:39] <fredoman> https://jsfiddle.net/08pqg0hk/6/
[19:39:59] <fredoman> and the music on the background: we are the champions - Queen!!!
[19:40:02] <robertmaxrees> use the console btw.
[19:40:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/08pqg0hk/7/
[19:40:18] <fredoman> hey robert, thank you so much!
[19:40:21] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that's basically it.
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> didn't even need my help :)
[19:41:01] <fredoman> i really appreciate your time :)
[19:41:05] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[19:41:08] <fredoman> do you believe in God?
[19:41:16] <fredoman> thank you so much!
[19:41:17] <robertmaxrees> Nope.
[19:41:23] <robertmaxrees> but you're welcome :)
[19:41:25] <fredoman> in that case, let me bless you :)
