[00:04:03] <takelong> im not good at jQuery and currently stuck with an issue
[00:06:21] <takelong> so I have this in my ajax http://pastebin.com/BzDEqnAk
[00:43:11] <solice> i would use something like handlebars for that
[00:43:12] <solice> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[00:48:19] <solice> takelong: you want to avoid creating markup in jquery as much as possible
[00:48:43] <solice> handlebars is much better for that
[02:29:59] <afidegnum> hello, i m using chosen to render selet fields but when i click on the form to edit, the list drop down i can't see the form, http://gsam.ga:9191/projects/pm/999167/activity_add
[03:21:02] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Is there any good way to render TIFF-files in Chocolat.js?
[03:21:26] <JosefDe> I've tried to do it with TIFF.js, but then Chocolat.js breaks
[04:56:38] <ahooo> hi
[04:56:56] <ahooo> how to stop jqm fuckin with my document.title?
[07:05:16] <jquery485> how to check if var number contains number 1 or 2 or 3?
[07:05:40] <jquery485> var number = 1 || 2 || 3; <---- doesnt work
[07:06:10] <jquery485> I want number to could be 1 or 2 or 3
[07:30:46] <jquery485> hello
[07:31:23] <jquery485> var element1 = pink;
[07:31:32] <jquery485> var element2 = green;
[07:32:52] <jquery485> $(this).(element1 + element2);
[07:33:17] <jquery485> $(this).addClass(element1 + element2);
[08:18:48] <ace_me> I am opening a modal and inside there I am tryng to render a multiselect ehynds jquery ui multiselect dropdown with http://pastebin.com/7emsJjmJ but the rendered multiselect is created in the body instead to be in the dialog
[08:25:22] <MikeD_> it's in the body so it can be over/in-front of other content
[08:26:19] <MikeD_> that also creates some hassle if you were hoping to style that content via descendant selectors in css
[08:30:40] <arup_r> I want to remove whose data value doesn't match with provider_id. But my code https://jsfiddle.net/don829f9/ not working
[08:30:44] <arup_r> any fix?
[08:30:56] <arup_r> i mean how to fix it?
[08:31:58] <MikeD_> you are comparing a number with a string
[08:32:43] <MikeD_> your filter function also lacks a "return"
[08:32:43] <ace_me> MikeD_ I was hoping to see it in my dialog ! is it possible to render it there inside dialog please ?
[08:33:11] <ace_me> maybe a hint
[08:33:22] <arup_r> yes return is the issue.. didn't notice
[08:34:53] <arup_r> MikeD_: how do I handle the string and interger type handing while comparing
[08:35:28] <arup_r> provider_id is the value from another dropdown field in my app.
[08:36:34] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/don829f9/1/
[08:38:21] <arup_r> well .data() returns Number. So I have to convert it
[08:39:00] <arup_r> fixed. thanks
[08:39:45] <arup_r> will it be good idea to use `!=` instead of `!==` .. to take the advantage of JS coercion?
[08:41:53] <shoky> no, being explicit is best
[08:44:00] <MikeD_> shoky: does that include String(foo) instead of "" + foo
[08:48:06] <shoky> i suppose. the former is better in any case ;p
[09:03:30] <ace_me> MikeD_ I was forgotting to add the css
[09:25:29] <anli_> When I use telerik, in which script file is $find declared?

[11:36:45] <lilalinux> I have a page with some anchors. If the current page is called without a target (i.e. without #), I would like to use a default anchor. Scrolling won't be enough, as I'm using :target selectors. Is that possible or do I need a redirect?
[11:57:29] <Cork> lilalinux: you can use window.history.pushState()

[12:42:22] <Forbidden_> Is there a way to store an elements click event to a variable, trigger new click event and then restore it back?
[12:42:59] <taplar> are you wanting to just bypass the click event?
[12:43:59] <Forbidden_> no I need to change it for a specific situation and then replace the original click event back on it
[12:44:26] <taplar> it would be better to use a delegated binding, imo
[12:44:30] <Forbidden_> so I figured if I can capture it to a var and then set it to something new, trigger the click and then reset back to default from var - would work
[12:44:57] <Forbidden_> what do you mean delegated bind, add new class and then set click on that class and remove it from that class when done?
[12:45:37] <taplar> pretty much, though you wouldn't be changing the binding.  just making the filter selectors match in which case you want them to match
[12:46:07] <Forbidden_> gotcha, so it would only affect based on the class I append
[12:46:17] <Forbidden_> that would work, thanks. I didn't think about that until you mentioned it
[12:46:32] <taplar> however it seems like your using events to direct logic
[12:46:42] <taplar> why not call the other method from the first click handler?
[12:47:05] <Forbidden_> I did and it isn't triggering it for whatever reason
[12:47:28] <Forbidden_> this is a third party script that I am working with - $(this).parent().find('#mk-filter-portfolio ul li a').click(function() { that is the original click
[12:47:48] <Forbidden_> and I do a find based on class to find a specific anchor tag and .trigger('click');
[12:47:51] <Forbidden_> no luc
[12:47:52] <Forbidden_> luck
[12:48:06] <taplar> no, what i'm saying is why do you have to do the click?
[12:48:19] <taplar> why not just call whatever you would be binding to that click handler for the other thing
[12:48:53] <Forbidden_> there is a few things going on inside their onlick
[12:48:59] <Forbidden_> on click
[12:49:10] <Forbidden_> unless I'm not understanding you
[12:49:32] <taplar> $(this).parent().find('#mk-filter-portfolio ul li a').click(function() { if (specificCase) { otherMethod(); } });
[12:50:52] <Forbidden_> hmm didn't know you could do the find like that
[12:50:58] <taplar> btw, $(this).parent().find('#mk-filter-portfolio ul li a') could really just be $('#mk-filter-portfolio ul li a')
[12:52:08] <Forbidden_> taplar: so what would go inside of if(specificCase) ?
[12:52:25] <taplar> whatever your condition is.  you said you only wanted to do it in a specific case
[12:54:00] <taplar> my main point with this is that there is some overhead with generating events.  so if you can call the methods you want directly instead of proxying their execution through an even trigger, it's better.
[12:54:18] <taplar> however if your more comfortable with that, give the delegate listener option a try so your not juggling bindings
[12:54:20] <Forbidden_> yeah, just on the initial load to load that item first then I need to remove it afterwards
[12:54:38] <Forbidden_> yeah I am going the delegate listener route I think this will work better
[12:55:27] <Forbidden_> taplar: thanks again.
[12:55:33] <taplar> np, gl
[13:10:13] <ajf-> This simple code that prevents a form being submitted works on this fiddle without issues: http://jsbin.com/cerofirila/edit?html,console,output  yet on my site it doesn't prevent the form submission no matter what. How can I debug this and find out what is going on?
[13:10:26] <Forbidden_> where is the link to your site?
[13:10:55] <ajf-> It's on my local drive sorry. Are there any common reasons why that would happen? It's the exact same code
[13:12:37] <Forbidden_> taplar: no luck, what would $(this).parent()... reference in your example above?
[13:13:05] <Forbidden_> so the fiddle is your code?
[13:13:20] <ajf-> yes, it is. Exactly that.
[13:13:42] <ajf-> I am not sure what could be causing the form submission not to be prevented.
[13:15:29] <ajf-> and same jQuery version as well.
[13:15:52] <Forbidden_> more than likely in your local source you are receiving a js error from somewhere else and it isn't hitting your on submit method
[13:16:06] <ajf-> note that I have no errors, and that the "Document is ready" does get hit and printed in the console.
[13:16:14] <Forbidden_> load the page with firebug or inspector open and see if you have any errors
[13:16:35] <Forbidden_> in firebug you can click persist and it will store your errors on submit so you don't lose it
[13:17:00] <ajf-> Nothing, just a sourcemap not parsing and a blocked ad from AdBlock.
[13:17:04] <ajf-> I'll try Firebug.
[13:18:34] <taplar> Forbidden_: dunno what 'this' would be.  i just copied what you had originally pasted
[13:18:41] <Forbidden_> gotcha
[13:22:35] <ajf-> Forbidden_: no errors in Firebug either with persist on: http://imgur.com/a/5s1ys
[13:22:47] <ajf-> and the form still not being prevented.
[13:23:10] <ajf-> should I try something like localtunnel to see if I can share the site?
[13:23:58] <Forbidden_> anything that would help us see what you are seeing would help - it isn't easy guessing
[13:26:00] <taplar> i don't see the message from the event binding
[13:26:15] <taplar> 'Trying to submit form'
[13:26:20] <ajf-> Forbidden_ does this work for you? http://ccuqluvkdk.localtunnel.me/blog
[13:26:49] <Forbidden_> it is loading
[13:27:02] <Forbidden_> slow, but loading
[13:27:05] <ajf-> taplar I see it on the small console tab. I am not sure if the actual browser console will show it for JSBin
[13:27:16] <ajf-> Forbidden_ the form is right above the footer
[13:27:17] <taplar> no i mean in your pic
[13:27:41] <taplar> i see the document is ready message, but not the other one
[13:27:49] <ajf-> Ah, no, because it doesn't work. On my local drive it just submits the form right away. No message, nothing. It just submits and reloads
[13:27:52] <Forbidden_> ajf-: don't see the form
[13:27:55] <taplar> right
[13:27:56] <ajf-> not even the console.log
[13:28:03] <taplar> so, that would seem to say it's not binding to the form
[13:28:16] <Forbidden_> taplar: correct, but his code looks right
[13:28:18] <ajf-> Forbidden_: do you see this: http://imgur.com/a/66kOZ
[13:28:28] <Forbidden_> I think it may be something else
[13:28:34] <taplar> that's not html dude
[13:28:49] <taplar> have you tried logging the length of the selector right before the binding?
[13:29:10] <ajf-> yes, and logging the selector right away. It works and it finds it.
[13:29:28] <Forbidden_> nope, the localtunnel isn't loading everything correctly
[13:29:30] <taplar> so length is > 0
[13:29:54] <ajf-> Shoot.
[13:31:23] <ajf-> taplar: console.log($('form.subscription-form').length); >>> 1
[13:31:33] <ajf-> right in there
[13:31:49] <taplar> in the script, not the console
[13:33:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wk4fLn7p/
[13:33:05] <taplar> right?
[13:34:25] <PlanC> is there no way to get a jQuery.get() or am I doing something wrong?
[13:34:31] <ajf-> Forbidden_ you can type here
[13:34:40] <taplar> PlanC: what do you mean?
[13:35:01] <PlanC> taplar, I'm sending a request to a URL and saving its data in a variable
[13:35:11] <PlanC> but I can't reach that variable outside the jQuery.get() function
[13:35:18] <taplar> right, because it's async
[13:35:27] <taplar> you have to use the value inside a callback
[13:35:37] <PlanC> how does that work?
[13:36:05] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:36:08] <taplar> wahbam
[13:36:34] <taplar> essentially when you execute an async process, such as an ajax request, following logic will continue to run while the request is still pending
[13:36:56] <taplar> so you have to give it callbacks that it will execute at the time that it finishes successfully or with error
[13:37:10] <taplar> that site will tell you more regarding those details
[13:37:29] <PlanC> checking it out now
[13:37:45] <PlanC> going to see if I can get the data sent to a callback function and update the variable from there
[13:38:26] <taplar> sure, you can update a more global variable from a callback.  the thing you have to be careful about is that you have to make sure that future methods that are going to use that variable know that the ajax is finished
[13:38:37] <taplar> and the only reliable way to do that, really, is with the callbacks
[13:39:04] <taplar> unless you know for certain that the call takes X amount of time and they won't do the other thing until X * something so you know it will happen afterwards
[13:41:15] <PlanC> what I'm trying to do is to avoid additional requests to the same URL
[13:41:17] <PlanC> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11978996
[13:41:22] <PlanC> this downloads the SVG data and inlines it
[13:41:41] <PlanC> I've created an object which saves the image URLs and their data
[13:42:10] <PlanC> so if the function finds an already existing image URL it'll just process that from the object instead of downloading it from the URL again
[13:42:55] <taplar> k
[13:44:07] <taplar> so I assume you have some sort of process that is kicking off those retrievals, and some other process is trying to potentially use them before the requests are finished?
[13:45:16] <PlanC> I'll paste the function, sec
[13:47:14] <PlanC> http://pastebin.com/50FF5UBW
[13:48:40] <taplar> oh, so are you saying that images on the page could have the same src?
[13:49:41] <PlanC> yeah exactly
[13:50:03] <PlanC> now async or not, the variable should be updated, right?
[13:50:05] <taplar> in that case what i might suggest is before your get i would insert a placeholder in your collection
[13:50:26] <taplar> so that further attempts would find it in the object and not repeat the request
[13:51:27] <PlanC> I'm not seeing how that would help
[13:51:48] <taplar> ln 14
[13:51:56] <taplar> you're checking if it has the data
[13:52:09] <taplar> but you're only inserting it into the object once the request finishes
[13:52:21] <taplar> you're not keeping track that you've previously started a request for it
[13:52:42] <taplar> by inserting a dummy value in there that ln 14 will be true and will return so you do not do it multiple times
[13:54:12] <PlanC> but how would I know if the image has been loaded before?
[13:54:26] <PlanC> because the svgFiles variable doesn't work
[13:54:44] <taplar> why do you say that?
[13:55:28] <PlanC> because it doesn't get updated inside the jQuery.get
[13:56:17] <taplar> so you're saying after ln 28 if you console log what you just set it doens't work?
[13:56:18] <PlanC> if it did then the "return false;" would easily catch it
[13:56:24] <taplar> no it wouldn't dude
[13:56:26] <taplar> lol
[13:56:28] <taplar> it's async
[13:56:54] <taplar> you understand that the speed at which javascript is able to process logic is very fast compaired to request resources over the net?
[13:57:16] <taplar> that look will most likely kick off all the get requests before any number of them finish
[13:57:21] <taplar> *loop
[13:58:16] <PlanC> ah I see, but I was under the impression that the .each() would be processed in order
[13:58:28] <taplar> which it does
[13:58:42] <taplar> but none of that guarentees that the get() from the previous iteration finished
[13:59:16] <PlanC> ah right... I was missing out on that all along
[13:59:20] <taplar> :)
[13:59:28] <taplar> which is why i suggested inserting a dummy before the get
[13:59:31] <PlanC> that explains why I can see the variable in the console
[14:00:27] <taplar> so a dummy insert until it can be replaced by the finishing get request will probably fix your duplicate requests for the same image
[14:00:42] <taplar> however your probably going to have an issue then with ln 44.  but baby steps, :)
[14:03:21] <PlanC> taplar, now that I understand the logic I think I'll be able to apply a solution
[14:03:31] <taplar> awesome, :)
[14:03:58] <taplar> it's a different mindset when dealing with async.  takes a little to kick in
[14:05:25] <PlanC> especially since I've mainly been coding PHP
[14:08:38] <PlanC> thanks for the help btw
[14:08:56] <taplar> np man
[14:22:04] <PlanC> alright there's a new problem
[14:22:17] <PlanC> I think there's some browser rule that could be causing this
[14:22:19] <PlanC> http://pastebin.com/1wJ09iNu
[14:22:43] <PlanC> basically I have the data now and I'm trying to dump the SVG data into two <div>'s
[14:23:02] <PlanC> now the strange part is that the latest <div> is filled with the SVG, but the first one is not
[14:23:05] <taplar> use an else
[14:23:15] <PlanC> that's not the issue though
[14:23:21] <taplar> ln 13, put it in an else to the if
[14:23:47] <taplar> or maybe that's not an issue as your returning
[14:23:47] <PlanC> that part is working though
[14:23:56] <PlanC> yeah it doesn't reach that if it's set
[14:24:07] <PlanC> that part is working fine and it's only requesting the file once
[14:24:12] <PlanC> but the part in the bottom
[14:24:23] <PlanC> $(".test1").html(svgData);  ==> EMPTY
[14:24:27] <PlanC> $(".test1").html(svgData); ==> SVG DATA
[14:24:38] <PlanC> *test2
[14:25:34] <taplar> does test2 appear in the markup before test1?
[14:25:48] <taplar> ah shouldn't matter
[14:25:55] <taplar> really?  test1 is empty?
[14:26:39] <taplar> and console.log($(".test1").length); inside that get method returns > 0 ?
[14:27:51] <PlanC> it's completely empty
[14:27:53] <PlanC> just checked again
[14:28:10] <taplar> ^ if you do that console log in the logic what does it print out?
[14:28:53] <PlanC> the data's there for both .test1 and .test2
[14:29:12] <PlanC> I just checked by adding console.log(svgData) after each $(".test1").html() line
[14:29:28] <taplar> that checks the data, not the elements
[14:29:43] <taplar> console log the element selectors to make sure they exists at that point in time
[14:29:57] <PlanC> going to check that now
[14:30:15] <PlanC> would be strange if there weren't there since I added them with HTML
[14:30:15] <taplar> if you get 0 then either they don't exist or your selector is incorrect
[14:30:59] <PlanC> they're all there
[14:31:05] <taplar> hmm
[14:31:10] <taplar> what kind of elements are they?
[14:31:14] <PlanC> just checked with console.log
[14:31:16] <PlanC> <div>
[14:31:28] <PlanC> there's really no explanation because the circumstances are the same for both elements
[14:31:38] <taplar> well that doesn't make sense.  i'd need to see it failing at this point
[14:31:42] <taplar> can you make a fiddle?
[14:31:42] <PlanC> the data's there too for both elements
[14:32:20] <PlanC> I'll try, but I'm not sure if the requests will be stopped by cors
[14:39:54] <PlanC> here it is:
[14:39:55] <PlanC> https://jsfiddle.net/604ujfh9/
[14:40:11] <PlanC> but you have to disable cors to make it work
[14:41:42] <taplar> wonder if we can find an svg on the net that is linkable
[14:42:06] <PlanC> tried searching for one without luck
[14:42:12] <PlanC> I think it's easier if you save it locally
[15:08:04] <taplar> PlanC: out of curiosity, try this logic https://jsfiddle.net/x1huwxa1/
[15:11:05] <subsonic> I have a script where you need to click an element twice for something to confirm.  It works, but I was wondering if there's a leaner way to do this: http://codepen.io/atourkow/pen/XdoOMz
[15:14:41] <taplar> delegates might make it cleaner
[15:16:33] <PlanC> taplar, tried that just now
[15:16:37] <PlanC> only provides 1 img
[15:16:42] <taplar> :(
[15:16:53] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[15:17:23] <subsonic> taplar: As in, just do it all in $('window').on('click', ...);  and check if the element clicked is td.title?
[15:17:32] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to get the outer height of a first level elements
[15:17:38] <GeekMonkey> and not include the child
[15:18:12] <taplar> subsonic: one sec, trying to do an example for you
[15:18:36] <subsonic> Great
[15:20:33] <PlanC> taplar, I think that it probably is a browser security measure that only allows the data to be used once
[15:20:57] <PlanC> the strange thing is that the dev console doesn't show any errors
[15:21:00] <taplar> you can only append the same element once
[15:21:08] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KSwX0nDwyn0SUkBN4oX
[15:21:11] <taplar> if that's what is happening that would make sense
[15:21:32] <taplar> but other things that are not Elements can be appended any number of times
[15:21:53] <GeekMonkey> Currently it is shows 34 when I hover ITEM A
[15:22:05] <GeekMonkey> but 68 when I hover ITEM B
[15:22:16] <GeekMonkey> I want it to read only 34
[15:23:38] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey so you're having an issue calculating the correct total height?
[15:23:46] <GeekMonkey> yes
[15:24:52] <GeekMonkey> Any ideas
[15:25:00] <robertmaxrees> making a fiddle to experiment.
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:25:39] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('.submenu li a')
[15:26:10] <robertmaxrees> that's getting everything that matches that selector.
[15:26:26] <GeekMonkey> I am hoping to just go one deep
[15:26:35] <robertmaxrees> then use the direct child selector.
[15:26:37] <robertmaxrees> >
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> or use .children() instead of .find()
[15:28:13] <GeekMonkey> that is not working
[15:28:17] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[15:28:18] <GeekMonkey> I must be doing it wrong
[15:28:23] <robertmaxrees> probably :)
[15:28:42] <robertmaxrees> why do you need these heights btw?
[15:29:12] <taplar> subsonic: dunno if it's leaner, but here ya go https://jsfiddle.net/rotp1fuk/ <-- does most of it except changing that botton "Off" text
[15:29:19] <GeekMonkey> For a menu that is created via wordpress... to make a nice slide reveal effect
[15:29:31] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees https://kobra.io/#/e/-KSwX0nDwyn0SUkBN4oX
[15:29:31] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey you don't need the heights for that fwiw.
[15:29:42] <GeekMonkey> fwiw?
[15:29:48] <robertmaxrees> fow what it's worth
[15:31:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you want to expand the current child menu when you hover over a parent?
[15:31:40] <GeekMonkey> yes
[15:32:25] <PlanC> tablar, I'll just run it as it is and download all the images
[15:32:51] <PlanC> tablar, I've already noticed that similar images give 304 Not Modified as they're cached by the browser
[15:32:54] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey one sec.
[15:33:31] <GeekMonkey> thx
[15:34:00] <subsonic> taplar: I love the use of .data().
[15:35:01] <taplar> cool
[15:35:41] <subsonic> I can see an issue of traversing all the elements might be a problem is there's a lot, or they are dynamically loaded
[15:35:57] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmtgyaf6/
[15:36:01] <robertmaxrees> this is dirty, but you get the idea.
[15:36:06] <taplar> subsonic: the titles are dynamic?
[15:36:25] <subsonic> Well, more are loaded in on scroll
[15:36:37] <taplar> then your fine.  they are delegate listeners
[15:36:45] <subsonic> Ahh, ok
[15:36:47] <taplar> oh, but the $allTitles would be messed up
[15:36:50] <taplar> :s
[15:37:13] <taplar> so you'd just want to do that lookup every time instead of caching it in a var
[15:37:46] <subsonic> yeah
[15:38:57] <subsonic> what's your thoughts on just including <td data-original-html="the orig title"> when it loads?
[15:39:13] <taplar> luv it, :)
[15:40:05] <taplar> heh, or you could get cssy on it
[15:41:01] <taplar> <td class="title"><span>The Original Title</span></td> and then have a CSS rule of .title.clicked span { display: none; }
[15:41:47] <taplar> then the toggle of the class drives that whole thing
[15:42:02] <taplar> different options, :)
[15:42:41] <taplar> lets see what that could look like
[15:42:44] <subsonic> The problem there is then updating to "Click again to complete".
[15:44:34] <subsonic> Could do something like <td class="title"><span class="click-no">The orig title</span><span class="click-yes">Click again to complete</span></td>
[15:44:44] <subsonic> But that's a lot of dupe code
[15:52:08] <Epoch`_> so, I have a select (drop down, whatever) and set it's value through $("#some").val("foo");  but, that doesn't work if there's an event associated with it like $("#some").change() or $("#some").on("change", foo());   What gives?
[15:54:11] <Epoch`_> Also, I'm using jQuery UI to make that #some a SelectMenu type
[15:56:08] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees thx
[16:07:45] <taplar> subsonic: that's what i was going to work towards to show, but some stuff is going on in the office
[16:08:53] <subsonic> Yeah, don't worry about it (unless you're finding the problem fun).  I get the gist :)
[16:17:58] <roflmyeggo> is there a benefit to using $('#myDiv ul li') over $('#myDiv li') if #myDiv contains a few different items besides the UL?
[16:18:36] <robertmaxrees> just more specific.
[16:18:42] <robertmaxrees> probably no actual difference otherwise.
[16:18:43] <subsonic> Is it any faster?
[16:18:52] <subsonic> I've always been curious about that
[16:19:27] <robertmaxrees> maybe?  any speed difference would be entirely negligible.
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[16:20:05] <robertmaxrees> for more info.
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> however, any performance differences will likely have no noticable impact in the real world.
[16:22:18] <robertmaxrees> long story short, always focus on writing readable code first.
[16:31:25] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: ok thanks :D
[16:32:01] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: are there any optimizations really worth pursuing in the wild as a general rule
[16:32:15] <roflmyeggo> scope from an ID if possible basically?
[16:32:24] <roflmyeggo> if you are selecting non-ID element
[16:34:25] <robertmaxrees> honestly, storing selectors.
[16:35:39] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, as far as selecting stuff is concerned, that first thing about jquery selector extensions is an OK one - there are a few cases that can really slow things down, though those are pretty exceptionals.
[16:38:11] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: that makes sense, wise words, thanks
[16:38:53] <dgsjm> anyone familiar with interact.js?
[16:42:41] <robertmaxrees> dgsjm nope, but sometimes we're able to help.
[17:02:48] <dgsjm> hm ok. might be specific to that module
[17:02:57] <dgsjm> and it's not really jquery related
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> ah.  you can feel free to try.
[17:03:27] <dgsjm> well its a module for touch and gesture handling
[17:03:29] <dgsjm> http://interactjs.io/
[17:03:48] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  what's the question?
[17:03:57] <dgsjm> but it seems to prevent the browser's native "pinch and zoom" functionality.
[17:04:14] <dgsjm> and i'm having trouble finding out how to fix that
[17:04:14] <robertmaxrees> ah, on the whole page you mean?
[17:04:29] <dgsjm> no, actually only on the element that has "interact" applied
[17:04:50] <dgsjm> i can pinch zoom all over the page, except on the <canvas> element that is "interact-ified"
[17:05:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, sounds about right.
[17:05:03] <dgsjm> im thinking it locks up some events and preventsDefault or something
[17:05:54] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[17:06:04] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't be surprised if that's the case.
[17:06:06] <dgsjm> is there a general/universal way to remove scripted handlers and revert to native browser functionality for a particular event?
[17:06:20] <robertmaxrees> afaik, not really.
[17:06:24] <dgsjm> bummer
[17:06:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd put in an issue on github with them.
[17:07:17] <dgsjm> ok ill try that. i posted a question to the project on gitter
[17:07:23] <dgsjm> no reply yet
[17:07:30] <dgsjm> but thanks for listening :P
[17:07:32] <robertmaxrees> how long ago did you post that?
[17:07:46] <dgsjm> not long. about 2 hours ago
[17:07:53] <robertmaxrees> lol yeah probably gonna take longer than that.
[17:08:21] <taplar> i thought it was said he posted to the project on glitter.  now i feel let down
[17:08:24] <dgsjm> i figured. plus im not sure how active the project is.
[17:08:33] <dgsjm> haha. point me to the glitter.
[17:08:40] <robertmaxrees> according to https://github.com/taye/interact.js/issues ?
[17:08:44] <robertmaxrees> probably pretty active.
[17:09:13] <dgsjm> not sure what this means: https://github.com/taye/interact.js/issues/412
[17:10:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:15:05] <taplar> clearly it's a statement about processed meats
[17:16:26] <taplar> ya know, hotdogs
[17:16:36] <dgsjm> ;) and now im hungry
[17:18:14] <dgsjm> this does not seem to do anything: https://github.com/taye/interact.js/blob/master/src/interactablePreventDefault.js
[17:21:41] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i'd have to see the stuff break.
[17:21:57] <robertmaxrees> or you've found a bug
[17:22:10] <dgsjm> yea i hear ya
[17:37:35] <Motoservo> How, with Jquery, would find all divs on a page that are inside a container with .collapse and count the divs that are inside of each div? I want to some logic on each item in the set of divs and add a class depending on that number found. Then move to the next set and do the same.
[17:38:06] <robertmaxrees> $('.collapse').find('div div').length maybe?
[17:38:16] <robertmaxrees> if i understand the question correctoly.
[17:38:18] <robertmaxrees> *correctly.
[17:38:44] <Motoservo> Was my first try but it counts all the divs found, because there are mulitple containers.
[17:39:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean for each .collapse separately?
[17:39:44] <Motoservo> Expected a few and got 42. But maybe the anwer to the meaning of life should suffice.
[17:39:49] <Motoservo> Yeah, each seperately.
[17:40:01] <robertmaxrees> right, you'd use a .each() in that case.
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.collapse').each(function() {}); blah blah blah
[17:40:30] <Motoservo> looked that that but hadn’t yet connected the dots. I’ll look again at the docs.
[17:40:35] <Motoservo> Okay, I’ll have another go.
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> yeha, give it a shot.  if oyu get lost, make an example on https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:40:52] <Motoservo> Looks easy enough.
[17:40:55] <Motoservo> cool.
[18:33:10] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[18:34:34] <dgsjm> $('#hotdogs').rotate();
[19:35:23] <deecee> Hey all. I'm trying to determine whether the ajax response contains JSON or just some html. This page ( http://stackoverflow.com/q/7288136 ) suggests two possible solutions:  setting datatype to 'json' & defining 'error', or using the 4th parameter like this: function(data, status, xhr, dataType)
[19:36:03] <deecee> Any reason to prefer one or the other?
[19:36:38] <Dan39> deecee: do you expect it to possibly not be json?
[19:37:02] <Dan39> are you not controlling the other side?
[19:37:03] <deecee> Dan39: If it's not json, it means the session timed out and it redirected to the login page.
[19:37:15] <deecee> This seems like a simple way to handle that case
[19:37:39] <Dan39> maybe detect if its ajax request and instead of redirecting to html page, return an http error?
[19:37:42] <Dan39> thats what i do
[19:38:19] <Dan39> then the success function doesnt even run
[19:38:29] <deecee> I believe (but don't know) that that would be more work since i'm using asp.net MVC. I'd have to customize the authorization checks.
[19:39:14] <Dan39> no idea on that side, i mostly use php or pretty much straight python (cherrypy)
[19:39:48] <deecee> right. The auth checks here are all built in. Possible to customize, but it'd be tedious.
[19:39:56] <Dan39> bummer
[19:40:14] <deecee> i think this quick fix should do the job though
[19:40:14] <Dan39> doesnt sound like an ideal thing to use for ajax scripts tbh
[19:40:53] <Dan39> deecee: i wonder about using jquery's getJSON
[19:41:03] <Dan39> i use that but dont expect to ever get non-json
[19:41:14] <deecee> why's that? sure, it could be a bit more explicit about what it's doing, but this doesn't feel terribly hacky
[19:41:41] <deecee> it's just treating non-json responses as another type of failure to handle
[19:42:17] <Dan39> ahim not an expert, sorry
[19:43:01] <deecee> nor am I. This is the first time I've done this.
[19:43:09] <Dan39> using datatype json may be useful deecee like you thought at first
[19:43:26] <Dan39> tias.
[19:43:59] <Dan39> jquery might run the error function instead of success if it gets html page, im not sure tbh :P
[19:44:04] <deecee> indeed. setting up to try it now.
[19:44:05] <Dan39> tias :D
[19:44:22] <Dan39> if it does work like that, i dont see why that wouldnt work fine for your case
[19:44:42] <deecee> I don't think it'll error because I didn't tell it "datatype: 'json' "
[19:44:50] <Dan39> o why not...?
[19:48:06] <Dan39> well good luck, im heading out
[19:49:37] <deecee> thanks Dan39
[19:50:12] <Dan39> btw, f asp.net :P
[20:08:06] <rand0m> hello! can anyone help me with something
[20:08:43] <rand0m> Im trying to re-run a piece of code on load, orientationchange and on resize
[20:08:49] <rand0m> as written here http://pastebin.com/LkQWDBQH
[20:08:56] <rand0m> but the code doesnt seem to work as expected
[20:09:12] <rand0m> any pointers to what I'm doing wrong would be much appreciated
[20:10:02] <taplar> anything in particular not work?
[20:10:28] <rand0m> when I resize my browser, the code does not work
[20:10:47] <taplar> one issue your going to have is line 8
[20:11:03] <taplar> your binding an event listener there
[20:11:13] <taplar> if that method fires multiple times, you will get multiple bindings
[20:12:09] <rand0m> if I use one, will it work?
[20:12:26] <taplar> you don't want to bind another event inside an event handler
[20:12:34] <taplar> *typically
[20:14:05] <taplar> i would suggest pulling that logic out of the outer binding first.  then in regards to the viewportWidth, update it with the outer event handler and have the two share that variable
[20:14:26] <taplar> is probably where i'd explore first
[20:16:16] <rand0m> hmmm
[20:17:10] <rand0m> do you mean resize orientationchange load #inside doc ready
[20:17:12] <rand0m> ?
[20:17:36] <taplar> the responsibility of resize orientationchange load would be to change the viewportWidth
[20:17:43] <taplar> then all the other binding would do is use it
[20:18:21] <rand0m> eh?
[20:18:27] <taplar> hold on, :)
[20:18:29] <rand0m> im not changing any viewpoer width :)
[20:18:33] <rand0m> port*
[20:18:37] <rand0m> im juct checking it
[20:18:41] <rand0m> just
[20:18:41] <taplar> ln 3
[20:18:51] <taplar> your getting it every time
[20:18:59] <rand0m> oic
[20:19:01] <taplar> for a resize or whatever, it can change
[20:19:12] <taplar> and your using it in the binding that your making every time
[20:19:15] <rand0m> yes
[20:19:24] <taplar> and since it is a local variable it will be scoped so that each binding has a different one
[20:19:29] <taplar> === not good
[20:20:00] <rand0m> doesnt that mean, whenever  the event is fired, the calculation happens again?
[20:20:35] <taplar> as it is every time the outer event happens, it will create a new scroll binding with it's own value for that variable
[20:20:55] <taplar> so then if you resize 10 times, there will be 10 scroll handlers all with different values for that guy
[20:21:06] <taplar> all competing to see who finishes last to give you a correct answer
[20:21:20] <taplar> which if one with an older value than what your width currently is, it will be wrong
[20:21:20] <rand0m> oic
[20:21:31] <taplar> one sec, i'll throw together a small fiddle for you
[20:21:44] <rand0m> sure thanks
[20:22:13] <rand0m> so in this case i should only run scroll binding once
[20:24:09] <deecee> Huh, that's unexpected. Ajax response, status 200, empty content.
[20:24:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/8qbs7jom/
[20:25:01] <taplar> deecee: what were you expecting a 401?
[20:25:11] <taplar> wait that's unauthorized, crap.
[20:25:27] <taplar> 201
[20:25:43] <deecee> taplar: 401 is a possibility, considering that I don't know exactly how the authorization redirect works.
[20:25:54] <taplar> 204, lol
[20:26:14] <deecee> i think it might start as a 401, but intercept (serverside) and redirect to the login page
[20:26:19] <taplar> what method are you using?
[20:27:28] <deecee> i have 2 different ones:  $.ajax  and whatever is generated by Razor's ajax helper, which is probably also $.ajax
[20:27:45] <taplar> no i mean, get/post/put/delete?
[20:27:48] <deecee> first things first, i'm checking the page source for obvious things
[20:28:08] <deecee> oh, right. This is post
[20:28:15] <taplar> and what operation are you doing?
[20:28:26] <deecee> oh, i now realize i have no idea how post works when you get redirected
[20:28:35] <taplar> a redirect would be a 301
[20:28:51] <taplar> followed by hopefully a 200
[20:29:05] <deecee> sure
[20:29:21] <deecee> would the response still be normal html for a post?
[20:29:31] <taplar> all depends on the endpoint
[20:29:40] <taplar> there is no standard
[20:29:43] <deecee> it could be. that's good enough.
[20:30:21] <deecee> i'm doing post-redirect-get, but this might be outside that flow
[20:30:58] <rand0m>  alright :D
[20:31:03] <rand0m> thank you taplar :)
[20:31:06] <taplar> rand0m: get the idea? :)
[20:31:07] <rand0m> it works
[20:31:09] <rand0m> yes
[20:31:57] <rand0m> on load calculate size and save; and on scroll / other events use the saved size
[20:31:59] <rand0m> makes sense
[20:32:18] <taplar> and resizing/orientation change will also update it
[20:33:24] <taplar> i'm curious what your doing though
[20:33:55] <rand0m> this is for fixing the header
[20:34:42] <taplar> ah, the whole it moves until it would go off screen and then sticks to the top thing
[20:34:48] <rand0m> when the page is scrolled, im adding a class to header which changes the header style
[20:35:01] <rand0m> I want this to happen only on tablets and mobiles
[20:35:16] <rand0m> so I've wrote the code to run the logic appropriately
[20:35:23] <taplar> you know for things like this it would be really awesome is media queries knew how to check scroll distance, :)
[20:35:25] <rand0m> yes
[20:35:48] <rand0m> is it possible o_O ?
[20:35:58] <taplar> not that i know of.  just wishfull thinking
[20:36:06] <rand0m> hah :D
[20:36:16] <taplar> i was going to suggest media queries until i saw the scroll thing
[20:36:21] <rand0m> oh I also have another question
[20:36:26] <rand0m> let me set up a fiddle
[20:52:10] <rand0m> here: https://jsfiddle.net/wrh6fg30/
[20:52:19] <rand0m> I'm trying to create a parallax effect
[20:52:27] <rand0m> but somethings afoot here
[20:54:31] <rand0m> aaahhhh
[20:54:42] <rand0m> I need to run $(window).stellar(); instead of $().stellar()
[20:55:03] <taplar> yup, i was just seeing that in the docs.  was trying to figure out if it needed to be window or something else
[20:57:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wrh6fg30/1/
[20:57:48] <taplar> there's a data attribute on the #parallax element to change it's scroll speed
[21:00:00] <rand0m> yes yes :)
[21:00:13] <rand0m> sadly I use latest jquery and this doesnt work with latest jquery
[22:40:35] <rand0m> ciao people
[22:40:40] <rand0m> thanks for all the elp
