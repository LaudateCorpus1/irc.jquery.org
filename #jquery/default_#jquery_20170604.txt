[02:02:28] <warden23> Hi, If a div has two classes, how do I select it using hasClass.. would it be .hasClass('class1', 'class2'); ?
[02:02:54] <warden23> For example: <div class="class1 class2"> :)
[02:03:38] <warden23> Reason for this is that if I have 4 div's and only 1 div has class2 I want to select it using both classes not just class2
[02:14:02] <warden23> I'll go about it another way. Anyone know why my jquery won't work? When I click [ Next ] checkout-payment-container should show. https://jsfiddle.net/b5srsk1z/24/

[11:58:59] <jak2000> hi all
[12:28:57] <DeadlyHero> Hello, I have multiple forms on my web, and I need to get that one form which is submited, with ajax, so How I can do that?
[13:45:12] <MACscr_> there has to be a better way to do this http://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/33265/. I havent even added the logic toggle things when clicked.
[13:58:16] <AgentCarmichael> Hello, can I write this with less code? https://jsfiddle.net/ncdwhojo/
[14:04:04] <pavonia> AgentCarmichael: https://jsfiddle.net/ncdwhojo/3/
[14:05:45] <AgentCarmichael> Very nice, thanks.
[14:58:33] <unm4sk> Hey. I'm wondering what is $.ajax interpreting as error? Right now i'm literally checking for errors in my success clause of AJAX, while error is for 500 errors etc.
[14:59:34] <unm4sk> For example, if username or password is invalid for user, do I really need to check for that in the success clause of AJAX call or can I make it go to error clause?
[16:55:42] <AgentCarmichael> Why does this code produce tons of error messages in the browser console at high speed? https://jsfiddle.net/pLcdz4oj/
[16:56:06] <AgentCarmichael> (that is, when you click on the div)
[16:56:37] <AgentCarmichael> The error is: Uncaught TypeError: r.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[16:59:12] <sodhi> Did you include jQuery UI?
[16:59:34] <AgentCarmichael> That's probably the reason then.
[16:59:37] <AgentCarmichael> I didn't.
[17:00:00] <AgentCarmichael> The point is that that code call is wrong though.
[17:01:00] <AgentCarmichael> The syntax is .fadeOut(speed,callback) and I did .fadeOut(speed,number)
[17:01:44] <AgentCarmichael> I'm trying to understand what the JS engine is trying to do when I call it this incorrect way.
[17:03:03] <sodhi> It's trying to apply 'easing', which is a jQuery UI option. Otherwise you need to call a function.
[17:03:35] <sodhi> If you want the callback, that is.
[17:05:15] <AgentCarmichael> I just included jQueryUI into my page but the same bug remains.
[17:05:49] <AgentCarmichael> It makes no sense to me how it doesn't trip up if I provide a number when it expects a callback.
[17:07:22] <sodhi> Easing doesn't have numeric values, I think. Try looking at the man :)
[17:07:33] <AgentCarmichael> Reading.
[17:09:49] <sodhi> Afair you can call fadeOut(duration, [,easing] [,complete]). So: fadeOut(400), fadeOut(400, function() { // woo, we succeeded }) *and* fadeOut(400, _value_, function() { // woo! }) are all valid.
[17:10:12] <sodhi> where _value_ is some string, that is a valid value for the easing.
[17:10:45] <AgentCarmichael> Ah, I see it was added in a newer jQuery version. I was reading the old one.
[17:11:37] <sodhi> :-)
[17:12:09] <AgentCarmichael> Ok, then why does it bug out on a numeric value? It applies easing.. and.. hm.
[17:12:54] <AgentCarmichael> As indeed the documentation states, [easing] takes a string but I give it a number..
[17:13:29] <AgentCarmichael> Unless it auto-parses to string.. dunno.
[17:13:38] <shoky> (which its implicitly converting to a string)
[17:14:32] <AgentCarmichael> Well, then why does it give the error that easing is not a function? There must be something deeper going on.
[17:14:38] <shoky> it'ss not the type that is the issue, it's the value..
[17:14:45] <shoky> "1000" is not a valid easing
[17:14:49] <shoky> only "linear" and "swing"  are
[17:15:02] <shoky> (and if you include jquery-ui then there are more options too)
[17:15:21] <AgentCarmichael> So we established that it's an invalid value. Why does hte JS engine keep endlessly looping over it as an error instead of erroring out once and that's it?
[17:15:40] <AgentCarmichael> Perhaps because easing is an animation..
[17:16:24] <shoky> because it's trying to animate, using the easing, in each animation "frame" or "tick"
[17:16:47] <AgentCarmichael> It seems that that's a lot of ticks per second.
[17:16:50] <shoky> the reason its endless is because it never reaches the target value
[17:16:54] <AgentCarmichael> Thanks for the explanation.
[17:16:55] <shoky> such are animations..
[21:16:35] <simbalion`> Is it possible to provide two different selectors to a script?
[21:17:08] <simbalion`> like ('.first|div.second')?
