[03:41:45] <rewte> Can anyone help me with updating JQuery on my server files for a Wordpress site?
[03:42:20] <rewte> I downloaded jquery-2.2.3.min.js
[03:44:32] <rewte> I see the JS folder in the CherryFramework subdirectory, and I see the Prior Jquery-1.7.2.min.js..... but there are some 11 or 13 other jquery files in the directory...
[03:44:41] <rewte> Does only this one file need to be updated?
[03:52:59] <baako> morning guys i want to turn this  https://jsfiddle.net/csrno0d5/2/ so it looks like this https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGgvwO76KWTYXFLNXR3Tkw3bGs. basically when you
[04:02:16] <Ou42> @baako radio buttons in jqm: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.0/docs/forms/radiobuttons/
[04:05:28] <Ou42> @baako but it also looks a little like this: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/collapsible/
[04:06:33] <baako> its not jquery mobile
[04:09:04] <Cork> rewte: replacing 1.x with 2.x is prob a bad idea
[04:09:40] <Cork> rewte: also some methods has been deprecated in later 1.x series so you can't just straight up replace 1.7 with a 1.9+ one
[04:10:04] <Cork> the scripts depending on it has to be checked so they support the new version
[04:15:35] <baako> Ou42, http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/collapsible/
[04:15:54] <baako> is it possible to download only a small site of jquert mobile library
[04:16:04] <Ou42> yes
[04:16:17] <baako> also does jquery mobile still act weird with jquery?
[04:17:46] <Ou42> dunno. "Download builder: Customize for speed" http://jquerymobile.com/
[04:18:34] <Ou42> @baako : http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[04:19:42] <Ou42> @baako : http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#custom-icons
[04:20:28] <baako> that might be better but will try the jquery mobile and see
[04:20:55] <baako> maybe not
[04:32:56] <Ou42> good luck
[05:13:42] <ahoo> why is there a difference between .find('option').detach() and .detach('option') ?
[06:18:01] <AdamPDotty> Was that a philosophical question?
[06:24:59] <ahoo> hehe
[06:25:05] <ahoo> no actually
[06:25:41] <ahoo> but we can discuss it philosophically if you're up to
[06:25:43] <ahoo> it
[06:25:56] <ahoo> which would of course be OT, though
[06:34:51] <AdamPDotty> It is a difference whether you detach something or detach from something.
[06:37:18] <Ou42> care to elaborate?
[06:40:15] <AdamPDotty> $('.container').detach('.content');
[06:40:25] <AdamPDotty> container != content
[06:40:39] <AdamPDotty> looks obvious enough to me
[06:43:12] <ahoo> but
[06:43:23] <ahoo> that's a different thing than my example
[06:43:40] <ahoo> $('.container .content').detach()
[06:43:49] <ahoo> and $('.container').detach('.content')
[06:44:20] <ahoo> first one selects .content inside .container and detaches all found elements, right?
[06:45:10] <ahoo> second one selects the container and then detaches all elements that match the selector in .detach
[06:45:14] <ahoo> i can't see the difference
[06:46:37] <AdamPDotty> okay, there I missed something
[06:47:01] <AdamPDotty> detach() without parameter indeed removes the element itself
[06:47:11] <AdamPDotty> so the effect should be the same
[06:47:58] <AdamPDotty> I think the second version is more obvious
[06:48:14] <AdamPDotty> but you are right, the effect should be the same
[06:48:44] <berpcor|2> Hello )
[06:49:09] <berpcor|2> I am training to create plugins using jQuery.
[06:49:42] <berpcor|2> Of course, I am using $.extend to override config object.
[06:49:53] <berpcor|2> The question is.
[06:50:33] <berpcor|2> What if I want to protect some properties from overriding?
[06:50:40] <berpcor|2> Can I do this?
[06:51:42] <berpcor|2> Or I should create two properties for config. One - inner, that I can't modify. Another is for overriding.
[07:00:45] <ahoo> sure you can
[07:00:53] <ahoo> you define pattern.
[07:15:10] <hellyeah> hey
[07:15:38] <hellyeah> what is the simplest way to delete current day selection in jquery ui datepicker?
[07:18:43] <Xatenev> hellyeah: $.datepicker._clearDate()
[07:23:45] <hellyeah> i didnt see that function in api
[07:23:53] <hellyeah> do i need to write this with my own?
[07:32:20] <Xatenev> hellyeah: no
[07:32:36] <Xatenev> hellyeah: I found it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9435086/how-do-i-clear-reset-the-selected-dates-on-the-jquery-ui-datepicker-calendar
[07:32:44] <Xatenev> its obviously an undocumented function of the datepicker api
[07:35:37] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  ah thank you
[07:38:59] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  this is nice but this is nice exactly what i am after
[07:39:02] <hellyeah> today is may 9
[07:39:17] <hellyeah> when you click input box it shows may 9 i want to remove that
[07:39:26] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/CoryDanielson/tF5MH/
[07:41:03] <hellyeah> i think he changed inner structur of datepicker
[08:25:36] <Slereah> Hello
[08:30:51] <AwkwardCough> heyo
[08:31:30] <Slereah> Currently trying to have a file download at the click of a button without having to change window
[08:32:40] <Slereah> I've got something like this : http://pastebin.com/UWfbc1nh
[08:32:50] <Slereah> But it no works so far
[08:33:13] <Slereah> a does give <a href="blob:http://localhost/95bc83bb-4ff7-400a-9c0d-29565b939452" download="Title HBBTV.json"></a>, which seems to be correct
[08:33:27] <Slereah> But I am not prompted to download it upon launching the script
[08:33:31] <Xatenev> Slereah: How about <a href="path" download="file_name.pdf">Download</a>
[08:34:00] <Slereah> Well ideally I would like the prompt to happen without clicking another button
[08:34:18] <Xatenev> you said at the click of a button
[08:34:24] <Xatenev> that is the button, you click it and it downloads the file.
[08:34:33] <Slereah> Yes, but the button launches the script, and the file is generated on the fly
[08:34:48] <Slereah> Hence i can't just put in the link on the button
[08:35:00] <Xatenev> window.location='file';
[08:35:09] <Xatenev> or window.open('file')
[08:35:37] <Slereah> I tried that, but since it's a Json file, it opens it in the browser directly
[08:41:45] <baako> hi guys i am using jquery ui for the accordion

[08:59:39] <baako> doesnt jquery ui work with jquery 2.1.3? i am trying to create a jsfiddle in the javascript where you click on the setting icon. you can choose which version of jquery you want to use. When i choose 2.1.3 it doesnt give you the option to choose jquery ui version but if you choose jquery 2.1.4 or 2.0.2 it give you the option for jquery ui version
[09:04:32] <AwkwardCough> baako: jsfiddle just doesnt include it like that, also https://jsfiddle.net/zbcys98a/
[09:05:13] <baako> AwkwardCough, try it for jquery 2.1.3
[09:07:23] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/zbcys98a/1/
[09:09:47] <baako> i dont know whats going on
[09:10:55] <AwkwardCough> uh its seems to be working, what is the problem again?
[09:13:33] <AwkwardCough> https://jsfiddle.net/zbcys98a/2/
[09:17:13] <AwkwardCough> Ronald245: do you mean divs that contain script tags?
[09:41:25] <Guest43381> i need help
[09:42:21] <Guest43381> this is my code : <div style="width:100px;height:360px;border:1px solid #000;">   <button type="button">Change Lights </button>     <svg height="100" width="100">     <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="red" />   </svg>   <svg height="100" width="100">     <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />   </svg>   <svg height="100" width="100">     <circle cx="50" cy="
[09:42:33] <taplar> please don't paste code in the chatroom
[09:42:41] <taplar> make a fiddle or pastie or something
[09:42:59] <Guest43381> how do you do that ?
[09:43:04] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[09:43:34] <AwkwardCough> put your code in the corresponding boxes then hit save
[09:44:13] <Guest43381>  <div style="width:100px;height:360px;border:1px solid #000;">   <button type="button">Change Lights </button>     <svg height="100" width="100">     <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="red" />   </svg>   <svg height="100" width="100">     <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />   </svg>   <svg height="100" width="100">     <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke
[09:44:31] <Guest43381> can you just help
[09:44:54] * AdamPDotty slaps Guest43381 around a bit with a large trout
[09:45:04] <AwkwardCough> put it in a jsfiddle then we can better help you so we dont have to sift thru word wrapped code
[09:45:26] <taplar> and we ask for working examples of the problem
[09:45:30] <Guest43381> <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/embed/"></script>
[09:45:57] <Guest43381> i can't do the function
[09:46:27] <AwkwardCough> http://jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/1/
[09:46:29] <taplar> what function?
[09:46:52] <Guest43381> i need to make the button work the traffic light
[09:46:59] <Guest43381> this is what i tried to do
[09:47:00] <Guest43381> <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/jspatel/3y9bqrhc/embed/"></script>
[09:47:06] <taplar> you can't do that
[09:47:19] <taplar> but besides that.  there is no logic that you've provided, just the markup
[09:47:33] <Guest43381> when i click the button the light will first go red
[09:47:44] <Guest43381> then yellow and then green
[09:47:52] <Guest43381> i need to make it as asimple as possible
[09:48:05] <Guest43381> ive never done computing before
[09:48:19] <AwkwardCough> you should take a look at learn.jquery.com then
[09:48:33] <AwkwardCough> but in regards to your problem, your binding on the lights themselves, not the button
[09:49:15] <Guest43381> how do i do that ?
[09:49:30] <taplar> put an id or a class on the button and bind to that
[09:49:56] <taplar> and keep state of what light is currently shown to know what change you need to do
[09:51:18] <Guest43381> <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/embed/"></script> i did the id
[09:51:32] <taplar> why do you keep linking that
[09:51:36] <taplar> just link the url
[09:51:52] <Guest43381> https://jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/
[09:52:20] <taplar> i don't see an id
[09:52:27] <taplar> and you put the markup back in the javascript block
[09:52:37] <taplar> it needs to be in the block labeled "HTML"
[09:53:47] <Guest43381> i did
[09:53:49] <Guest43381> https://jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/2/
[09:54:18] <taplar> ok, i see the id, but it's on a circle, not the button
[09:54:23] <Guest43381> i know im really like annoying and stuff but thanks for the help
[09:54:36] <taplar> and your js isn't included with that fiddle
[09:54:41] <Guest43381> okay i need to make the id on the button ohh yhh i get it
[09:55:03] <Guest43381> but where in the button code would it put it ?
[09:55:39] <taplar> <input type="button" id="someId">
[09:58:54] <Guest43381> https://jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/4/
[09:59:31] <taplar> you have tf1 repeated on the button and first circle.  ids can't be repeated
[09:59:43] <taplar> but other than that, yeah, so do your logic based off the clicking of the button
[10:00:19] <Guest43381> now i have to do on click "tf1" change to trasnparent and "tf2" to yellow
[10:00:32] <Guest43381> oh this is the id for the BUTTON
[10:01:16] <Guest43381> where would i put the on click and change "tf1" to "red"
[10:01:40] <Guest43381> https://jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/5/
[10:02:56] <Guest43381> https://jsfiddle.net/phf17n8x/6/
[10:09:28] <Guest43381> can someone please help
[10:09:32] <AdamPDotty> Guest43381: the red markings mean something
[10:10:00] <Guest43381> what?
[10:10:05] <Guest43381> ==
[10:10:46] <Guest43381> help
[10:10:51] <AwkwardCough> red markings mean errors on your jsfiddle. In this case you are missing some quotes
[10:11:08] <AdamPDotty> before you work an a feature, fix the syntax!
[10:16:08] <AwkwardCough> and they left before I found what homework assignment they were working on
[10:20:59] <AdamPDotty> I'm still with you (kind of)
[10:22:40] <AwkwardCough> I shall cherish that :D
[12:20:33] <Guest33204> i need help

[12:23:59] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/
[12:24:10] <Guest33204> that is my code i need help making the function
[12:24:13] <taplar> the homework assignment has returned!
[12:24:16] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:24:20] <Guest33204> yesss
[12:24:23] <taplar> on that note, i'm going to lunch
[12:24:23] <robertmaxrees> sooo where's the JS?
[12:24:25] <robertmaxrees> what've you tried?
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:25:06] <robertmaxrees> also, that's invalid HTML.  you never close your div.
[12:25:20] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/jspatel/3y9bqrhc/
[12:25:26] <Guest33204> that is what iv'e tried
[12:25:33] <Guest33204> oh yh let me fix it
[12:26:18] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/1/
[12:27:04] <Guest33204> i need to make the traffic light work like a traffic light but only when i click the button every time then it will change color my code i have to click the cricle
[12:27:08] <Guest33204> please help
[12:27:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to raise a big red flag here for you and point out that jquery and svg don't mix terribly well.
[12:28:18] <Guest33204> i don't know i just need help
[12:28:23] <robertmaxrees> i'
[12:28:26] <Guest33204> this my broken function
[12:28:27] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/3y9bqrhc/9/
[12:28:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:28:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/2/
[12:28:44] <robertmaxrees> so you have this.
[12:28:49] <robertmaxrees> what do you need to have happen instead?
[12:29:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/3/ this one actually functions.
[12:29:34] <Guest33204> i need the button to change color
[12:29:40] <decx> wouldnt go as far as to use the word "functions"
[12:29:44] <robertmaxrees> so bind to the button instead of circles.
[12:30:26] <Guest33204> first click on button the red and yellow appear and the  third one is transparent, then on the second click 1st to circles are transparent and last is green, then the pattern to repeat
[12:30:32] <Guest33204> yh i need help doing that
[12:30:36] <robertmaxrees> great.
[12:30:43] <robertmaxrees> so start by binding to the button instead.
[12:31:15] <Guest33204> how do i do that ?
[12:31:23] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:31:26] <Guest33204> im terribly bad at computing
[12:31:33] <robertmaxrees> you're already bound to the circles.
[12:31:36] <robertmaxrees> to it to the button instead.
[12:31:41] <robertmaxrees> what about that is ambiguous?
[12:31:59] <robertmaxrees> $("circle").click(function() { - do you understand what this part of your code is doing?
[12:32:19] <Guest33204> oh yh
[12:33:24] <Guest33204> so shall i write button instead
[12:34:20] <Guest33204> first i was going to inside the button tag i was going to write on click "circle id" change to "red"
[12:34:37] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[12:34:46] <robertmaxrees> change to using the button for starters :)
[12:35:31] <Guest33204> done
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> show me :)
[12:36:09] <Guest33204> i know that im annoying and making my self look like a idiot, i just don't understand so just walk me through it , thanks
[12:36:13] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/6/
[12:36:30] <robertmaxrees> this is a channel for help and learning - so long as we see progress, we're good :)
[12:36:37] <Guest33204> oops worng one
[12:36:37] <robertmaxrees> we're just not going to do it for you.
[12:36:42] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/7/
[12:36:49] <Guest33204> no i don't want that
[12:36:54] <Guest33204> i want to know how to do it
[12:37:15] <decx> try to abstract it so you dont have to juggle strings like that
[12:37:16] <robertmaxrees> right :)
[12:37:28] <decx> like fillOpacity or something
[12:37:31] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 so now your next problem - do you see it?
[12:37:34] <Guest33204> brb
[12:41:45] <Jagst3r15> hello friends!
[12:42:44] <Guest33204> back
[12:42:59] <Guest33204> the problem with my code is i don't want to do it like that
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 huh?
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> right, you want it when you press the button.
[12:43:21] <robertmaxrees> do you see why your code doesn't work now?
[12:44:25] <Jagst3r15> I was having a weird issue in Chrome 50 (the latest one) where the sockets weren't being released and it was causing the video to show as pending (e.g. it would never load)..now I added a fix down by lines 56-58 based on this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16137381/html5-video-element-request-stay-pending-forever-on-chrome ...but the problem is that this way literally removes the video...
[12:44:41] <Jagst3r15> how would I implement the timestamp version that someone mentions in that thread..broken down test case is here: http://output.jsbin.com/hoyuwetura
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 I'd ask in ##javascript instead.
[12:44:54] <Jagst3r15> ok
[12:45:01] <Jagst3r15> this issue has been killing me
[12:45:04] <Jagst3r15> stupid Chrome :(
[12:53:00] <Guest33204> I DID IT
[12:53:02] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/x6rrtuxj/8/
[12:53:13] <Guest33204> I  NEED HELP WITH THE GREEN
[12:53:19] <robertmaxrees> uh..
[12:53:20] <mmmveggies> Guest33204: mazel tov :)
[12:53:22] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick.
[12:53:30] <Guest33204> but i want to
[12:53:31] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly the wrong way to do this heh,
[12:53:44] <Guest33204> i have to
[12:53:48] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:53:48] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:53:52] * taplar queues up some backstreet boys
[12:53:56] <decx> think about a way to not have to hardcode stuff
[12:54:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:54:12] <robertmaxrees> you were using .click() a second ago.
[12:54:18] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use that any more?
[12:54:34] <decx> 3 items, you start at 0, button increments that number until you hit items.length, after that you decrement until you hit 0
[12:54:49] <decx> as a traffic light goes red yellow green yellow red
[12:54:51] <robertmaxrees> decx something tells me that went way over their head ;)
[12:55:03] <robertmaxrees> also, not in the states :)
[12:55:16] <Guest33204>  my friend told me to use it and i don't under stand it
[12:55:16] <decx> how's that
[12:55:34] <robertmaxrees> decx ours just go green yellow red, then back to green.
[12:55:40] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 it's much easier to use.
[12:56:00] <Guest33204> my one or you're one ?
[12:56:05] <robertmaxrees> .click()\
[12:56:06] <decx> so you just floor it from red
[12:56:08] <decx> weird
[12:56:16] <taplar> but accurate
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 - http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/ you should read the guide, but starting with http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/ would be a great idea for you.
[12:58:11] <Guest33204> but i still don't understand why  i can't use the  on click
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't.  shoving that much code in there is a bad idea.
[12:58:37] <robertmaxrees> and it's easier to maintain.
[12:59:04] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted to learn :)
[12:59:13] <taplar> there's more to 'solving the problem' than the immediate problem
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> right, and if you want to learn, you might as well learn the "better way" to do it.
[13:04:57] <Guest33204> can i have a id in a var ?
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:05:26] <robertmaxrees> you can absolutely get an element's ID.
[13:06:20] <Guest33204> https://jsfiddle.net/3y9bqrhc/10/
[13:06:32] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:06:38] <Guest33204> so after the " shall i put the id of my circle ?
[13:06:56] <robertmaxrees> why would you put it in an array?
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37004734/how-to-use-javascript-to-make-a-button-change-an-svg-elements-colour lol
[13:09:29] <Guest33204> the whole of the schools across the country have tasks like that
[13:09:32] <decx> scrap fill, use style fill&fillOpacity
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out that it's almost identical.
[13:10:18] <robertmaxrees> decx they can't even figure out how to use an array correctly.  i'm going to guess they're really a true beginner.
[13:10:32] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 i'd really suggest doing a tutorial of some kind to help you get your bearings.
[13:10:37] <decx> well that's a good thing then
[13:10:45] <decx> cause instead of juggling strings you just put 1 or 0
[13:10:55] <decx> with fillOpacity
[13:11:15] <Guest33204> you people are rude as hell
[13:11:19] <Guest33204> get some manners !
[13:11:22] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 pardon?
[13:11:23] <decx> go fuck yourself
[13:11:29] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:11:32] <Guest33204> geek nerds
[13:11:36] <taplar> degraded fast
[13:11:37] <AwkwardCough> :/
[13:11:45] <Guest33204> so way in over your self
[13:11:55] <robertmaxrees> alright - everybody chill.
[13:11:55] <taplar> we're not the ones asking for help
[13:11:59] <decx> hey if i'm gonna get called rude ima go all in
[13:12:06] <robertmaxrees> Guest33204 nobody here was being rude towards you before you said that.
[13:12:06] <Guest33204> not even going to bother
[13:12:35] <AwkwardCough> well then... went 0 to 60 real quick
[13:13:03] <robertmaxrees> not going to give them the chance.
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[13:13:40] <AwkwardCough> if only we had some sort of signal to help determine what went wrong....
[13:13:46] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha.
[13:13:50] <decx> guest in the nick
[13:14:15] <mmmveggies> wow I was JUST about to link to a fiddle where I solved his problem :p
[13:14:17] <robertmaxrees> saying they wanted to learn to do it the right way and then totally ignored and argued against any advice we gave?
[13:14:28] <taplar> eh, homework.  i'm not going to solve it
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:14:40] <robertmaxrees> skirts the issue, too.
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> they need to learn how to do it themselves.
[13:15:28] <mmmveggies> it's my subtle approach to keeping CS jobs employee-favored
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:15:41] <mmmveggies> solve their problems so they don't have to think... eventually they'll just hire someone :D
[13:15:49] <taplar> i take offense to the nerd part though.  i get paid.  i'm a geek
[13:15:49] <AwkwardCough> I take offense to the geek part though... get paid. im a nerd
[13:15:57] <taplar> fk man
[13:15:57] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:16:02] <decx> hiveminded
[13:16:09] <mmmveggies> jesus
[13:16:10] <decx> you god damn snowflakes
[13:16:15] <AwkwardCough> pair programming :D
[13:16:15] <taplar> lmao
[13:17:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm taking the plunge into python 3.x now D:
[13:17:24] <mmmveggies> hooray! embrace the future!
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> i don't wanna (crycry)
[13:17:39] <Uhkis> RIP robertmaxrees
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> IT WAS A GOOD RUN FOLKS.
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> nah it's for a small app and i want to use http://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/
[13:18:19] <taplar> trinities are never good, well, maybe the original was alright
[13:18:39] <mmmveggies> that's why React went straight from 0.12.0 to 13.0
[13:18:40] <AwkwardCough> if you ever want to jump into the turn you should totally do http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ semi fun puzzle challenges
[13:18:53] <mmmveggies> and node went straight from 0.12 to 4.0
[13:18:53] <fiord> after Bitbucket's video on pair programming I can never think of it without laughing
[13:19:05] <robertmaxrees> that video is magical.
[13:19:12] <fiord> agreed :D
[13:19:13] <taplar> ? that the one with the paired potty?
[13:19:13] <b-ot> that thank a lot yu deserve a great that that

[13:19:33] <taplar> ya
[13:19:36] <mmmveggies> spooning is webscale
[13:22:26] <taplar> hmm, py 3 was released in '08?  way you were talking i thought it was something new
[13:22:53] <robertmaxrees> there was a big backlash when it came out because it changed quite a bit and CHANGE IS THE WORST OKAY?
[13:23:15] <taplar> cerealistly!
[13:36:01] <mmmveggies> honestly, python is the most notorious example of major-version squatting that I know
[13:36:12] <mmmveggies> so... it has to *partially* be their fault
[13:49:18] <taplar> can't trust snakes anyway
[13:49:36] <taplar> sorry, that's racist
[14:15:48] <Squarism> given a div width id="root", there exist a nested hierarchy which contain div elements with class="node". Given any tag (with say id="myLoc"), nested in described hierarchy - how can i find the "previous" class="node" element?
[14:16:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:16:17] <Squarism> oh.. node's are never wrapped inside each other
[14:16:37] <robertmaxrees> so you want the previous sibling element that matches a given selector?
[14:18:04] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, lemme show
[14:18:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:22:24] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/g05xw3es/
[14:22:41] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:23:02] <robertmaxrees> btw this isn't valid - can't put divs in spans, but I get your thinking.
[14:23:17] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:23:32] <Squarism> within any of those class="node" tags i wanna be able to find the previous, given the ID of the class="node" tag
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> "the id of the class="node" tag.
[14:24:01] <robertmaxrees> so you mean, if given "a3", you want to get to a2?
[14:24:04] <roger1> I'm playing with jquery.mobile and it seems like I need to include:  data-role='page' on my body tag to get the page to load. Though, for some reason that is messing up some css elements from another framework i'm using. Is there any way aroudn this?
[14:24:10] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, exactly
[14:24:14] <robertmaxrees> Squarism or if given a5, you want a4?
[14:24:17] <gambl0re> hi robert
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> hello gambl0re
[14:24:25] <Squarism> Robdgreat, right
[14:24:30] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, right
[14:25:04] <robertmaxrees> roger1 you could not use the jquery mobile css or include the other framework after to see if the specificity wins out, but it's not likely.
[14:25:38] <robertmaxrees> Squarism i might look at this a little differently - give these all data attributes and then filter to get the one you want.
[14:25:44] <robertmaxrees> instead of using DOM traversal.
[14:27:07] <robertmaxrees> then you could just nab that value, decrement by one, and .filter() all the .node elements for that one.
[14:27:16] <roger1> robertmaxrees: i'm not including jquery mobile css
[14:27:22] <robertmaxrees> roger1 no idea then.
[14:28:49] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, im not sure i understand you now
[14:29:24] <robertmaxrees> where are you confused?
[14:29:49] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, the html i sent was an example of a possible layout.. it should be considered totally dynamic
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> Squarism i don't know what that means in this case.
[14:30:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/g05xw3es/1/ but osmething like this
[14:31:29] <robertmaxrees> gotta go to lunch.  enjoy.
[14:31:39] <Squarism> robertmaxrees, hmm.. you might be ontoi something.. but the ids arent numeric
[14:32:29] <Squarism> maybe i can find all node beneth root, locate myLoc in and its index.
[14:32:38] <Squarism> then take previous
[14:45:06] <berpcor|2> http://jsbin.com/rolosemezi/edit?html,js,output
[14:45:49] <berpcor|2> Why I get Window object as this when I call doSomething function?
[14:46:13] <taplar> cause it's not bound to anything else
[14:46:32] <taplar> what else would it be?
[14:46:35] <Cork> berpcor|2: dosomething() doesn't have a this
[14:46:39] <eddy> hi guys how do i find out if i have an eventlistener on an id?
[14:46:40] <eddy> $( "#accordion" ).accordion({ collapsible: true });
[14:46:41] <Cork> so it gets the global window object
[14:46:58] <Cork> berpcor|2: you want console.log(dosomething.call(this))
[14:47:10] <Cork> or send it as a normal variable
[14:47:46] <taplar> or bind that function directly
[14:47:58] <taplar> $('body').on('click', 'button', doSomething);
[14:48:04] <Cork> ya
[14:48:39] <Cork> berpcor|2: also i think what you're trying to do is simplest done through .trigger('click') on the body element
[14:48:40] <eddy> i have this code which seem to work on jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/m50jxyp7/ but on my site it doesnt seem to work
[14:48:43] <Cork> (man i hate jsbin)
[14:48:44] <berpcor|2> Cork: Got it. Thanks. )
[14:48:57] <eddy> so i want to find out if they is actually an event listner on that id
[14:49:10] <Cork> i tried to give you a fix but jsbin loses the changes as always
[14:49:17] <berpcor|2> Cork: Actually, I try to understand what means this in different situations. Scope understadning.
[14:49:37] <Cork> berpcor|2: this is set with .call or .apply
[14:49:57] <Cork> it is an explicit defined variable for each function
[14:49:57] <taplar> eddy: which id?  the accordion appears to be working, if it's the bottom element
[14:50:12] <berpcor|2> Cork: or... when I am listening to some actions (on...)?
[14:50:26] <eddy> taplar, on the jsfiddle yea but on my site it aint
[14:50:37] <Cork> berpcor|2: on internally (inside the browser) does the same thing as .call
[14:50:38] <taplar> ok, any console errors?
[14:50:45] <eddy> taplar, what do you mean bottom element?
[14:50:51] <Cork> berpcor|2: so no actually, it is the same thing
[14:50:57] <taplar> the section 1 section 2 part
[14:51:07] <berpcor|2> Cork: Oh, interesting...
[14:51:51] <eddy> taplar, no error
[14:51:56] <Cork> think of it as this: function on(callback) { when(triggered) { callback.call(element, event); } } //psudo code
[14:52:05] <eddy> taplar, yes the section 1 and 2 part
[14:52:15] <taplar> console.log your selector right before your doing the accordion on it and make sure it's finding it (length > 0)
[14:52:51] <taplar> and http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[14:53:29] <taplar> wish we could program b-ot with that as like ?debug
[14:55:26] <eddy> taplar, how do you console log a selector if you dont mind me asking
[14:55:39] <taplar> console.log($('selector'));
[14:55:53] <taplar> put .length on it if you want to just see the number
[14:55:57] <berpcor|2> Cork: One more thing about javascript... function someFunc(e){}; e.preventDefault(); Where is this e from? Why this is e? I understand that function gets some arguments and here can be any name. But how do I know what exactly gets any function: my, custom functions or any other (like functions during ajax calls)?.. I use it for a long time. But I don't understand the underlying concept...
[14:56:11] <taplar> e is the event
[14:56:16] <Cork> berpcor|2: it is event
[14:56:30] <Cork> berpcor|2: it is the second argument to call() in my example
[14:56:31] <taplar> it can be named anything, however, but tradition is e or event or something like that
[14:56:39] <berpcor|2> Cork: Yes, it is  a shorthand from event.
[14:56:43] <berpcor|2> I know it.
[14:56:52] <Cork> berpcor|2: as any function based language you can name the variables in a function what ever you like
[14:56:54] <berpcor|2> It is just name.
[14:57:05] <Cork> it is just that
[14:57:31] <berpcor|2> How do I know what arguments functions gets. I'll give you an example... moment...
[14:57:44] <Cork> berpcor|2: you would have to look at documentation
[14:57:54] <Cork> there isn't really a way to "know" in javascript
[14:57:59] <decx> arguments is a reserved name for an array of all args
[14:58:15] <Cork> decx: actually it isn't an array
[14:58:19] <Cork> it is an array like object
[14:58:20] <decx> right array like
[14:58:31] <Cork> it lacks a lot of array functions
[14:58:38] <Cork> like length :)
[14:58:56] <decx> still no length?
[14:58:57] <taplar> heh, is that to promote people to actually declare their inputs? ;)
[14:58:59] <decx> even with ...?
[14:59:09] <eddy> taplar, thanks i see the issue because i have a one page app which loads other pages depending on what the user is doing
[14:59:19] <taplar> cool
[14:59:24] <eddy> console.log($('#accordion').length); runs when the home page is loaded and doesnt run again after
[14:59:32] <taplar> there ya go
[14:59:35] <Cork> decx: ... isn't arugments its a new overflow name that's completely slipped my mind right now
[14:59:47] <eddy> so i might need to add it to an on click listner
[14:59:52] <decx> spread
[15:00:15] <berpcor|2> http://jsbin.com/vuduzizave/edit?html,js,output
[15:00:15] <Cork> decx: ya you have to do Array.prototype.<function>.call(arguments, options) for a lof of array things with arguments
[15:00:22] <Cork> decx: right
[15:00:44] <Cork> berpcor|2: please use jsfiddle
[15:00:48] <Cork> jsbine is a mess
[15:00:57] <Cork> *jsbin
[15:01:18] <taplar> and Cork already told you you have to look at the docs
[15:01:28] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/x9d0h72s/
[15:01:44] <decx> you're actually better of just for looping through them as all the array methods actually create a new array that just sits there in memory
[15:02:12] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[15:02:30] <Cork> berpcor|2: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[15:03:26] <Cork> taplar: actaully it isn't exactly deferred.done
[15:03:37] <Cork> cause the arguments you get from deferred isn't defined
[15:03:48] <Cork> what you get from jqxhr is though
[15:03:48] <taplar> yeah, i wasn't sure if there was another page
[15:04:01] <berpcor|2> This is exactly like I was thought about it... Averall: my custom functions - I set what functions get. Any native functions for javascript or any other library, like jquery - I see docs.
[15:04:15] <berpcor|2> Is it correct?
[15:04:29] <Cork> berpcor|2: ya
[15:04:44] <Cork> javascript isn't a liverary though :)
[15:04:52] <Cork> javascript is the language jquery is a lib
[15:05:20] * Cork types like crap when he hangs on one arm...
[15:05:40] <berpcor|2> I am just was wundering, when somebody in their video lessons so easily told what means one argument or another. They've just knew it by reading the docs. Now I understand )
[15:05:56] <taplar> and repetition
[15:05:59] <berpcor|2> *wondering
[15:06:25] <Cork> ya, you will remember what a lot of the functions take/returns
[15:06:40] <berpcor|2> Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
[15:06:45] <taplar> it's like explaining a tv remote to someone
[15:06:58] <Cork> document.requestAnimationFrame(function(time) {});
[15:07:25] <Jagst3r15> any idea why video.get(0).prop('src', ''); would trigger TypeError: e.get(...).prop is not a function
[15:07:38] <Cork> Jagst3r15: cause prop is a jquery function
[15:07:40] <decx> get retrieves a dom node
[15:07:46] <Cork> Jagst3r15: replace .get with .qe
[15:07:49] <taplar> you type fast for a one handed guy, lol
[15:07:50] <berpcor|2> taplar: Good analogy...
[15:07:56] <Jagst3r15> :)
[15:07:58] <decx> .que()?
[15:08:16] * taplar replaces hand with arm
[15:08:18] <Cork> bah... .eq()
[15:08:27] <rewte> Can someone help me with a question about updating Jquery in a wordpress site?
[15:08:42] <Jagst3r15> hi taplar..guess what? I found the issue
[15:08:42] <Cork> rewte: i already answered that the last time you asked
[15:08:50] <taplar> sup?
[15:09:00] <rewte> It rolled off the screen overnight while i was away
[15:09:05] <rewte> How do I see further back?
[15:09:12] <Cork> rewte: check the channel topic
[15:09:20] <Jagst3r15> taplar in Chrome's latest version when the sockets hit 6 it will throw a video pending issue
[15:09:21] <Cork> "Channel logged"
[15:09:31] <taplar> ah
[15:09:36] <Jagst3r15> chrome's latest version has issues closing out sockets when audio/video ends
[15:09:52] <taplar> that sux
[15:10:05] <Jagst3r15> yeah..but I am trying to assign a variable to the source
[15:10:09] <Jagst3r15> and then destroy it
[15:10:14] <Jagst3r15> but then add it back in on end
[15:10:25] <Jagst3r15> the source of the video that is
[15:10:27] <Cork> Jagst3r15: i don't think that will work
[15:10:36] <taplar> your going to destroy it while it's playing?
[15:10:37] <Jagst3r15> why is that
[15:10:41] <Jagst3r15> no on end
[15:10:45] <Cork> the socket way below the javascript
[15:11:12] <Cork> javascript isn't even suppose to be able to tell if the socket is open or the browser plays from cache
[15:11:40] <Jagst3r15> I'm going off of this Cork : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16137381/html5-video-element-request-stay-pending-forever-on-chrome#answer-30728621
[15:11:40] <berpcor|2> And how can I loop through all arguments of method I have no documentation for?
[15:12:00] <berpcor|2> You told that it is array...
[15:12:09] <berpcor|2> of data
[15:12:12] <taplar> what method?
[15:12:18] <taplar> is this method from an api?
[15:12:19] <berpcor|2> Any.
[15:12:21] <Cork> berpcor|2: you can check the local variable "arguments"
[15:12:22] <berpcor|2> Yes.
[15:12:24] <decx> console.log(arguments)
[15:12:29] <Cork> berpcor|2: though note it will only be the values
[15:12:31] <Cork> not what they are
[15:13:27] <taplar> i find it rare though that apis don't have some documentation.  atleast in javascript land.  maybe poor documentation, but some
[15:13:32] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/x9d0h72s/1/
[15:13:39] <taplar> and you can always troll the source and take a peak
[15:13:55] <taplar> if it's not minified,
[15:14:04] <Cork> decx: btw, no arguments isn't a reserved word https://jsfiddle.net/z4542w77/
[15:14:06] <Jagst3r15> Cork does that answer sem reasonable?
[15:14:09] <rewte> So can I create a backup folder with copies and see if replacing it works?
[15:14:18] <decx> wow
[15:14:29] <decx> well it's javascript
[15:14:34] <decx> var undefined = true;
[15:14:41] <taplar> :/
[15:14:49] <Cork> Jagst3r15: it removes the video element, that MIGHT work
[15:15:04] <Cork> though i wouldn't guarantee it
[15:15:23] <Jagst3r15> hmm
[15:15:28] <Cork> rewte: sure, it is just a js file
[15:15:40] <Cork> rewte: it isn't like it will permanently ruin anything
[15:15:56] <rewte> So when I look in the JS folder,.... there are some 20+ Jquery files
[15:16:03] <rewte> I only replace that one
[15:16:06] <rewte> jquery-1.7.2.min.js
[15:16:10] <berpcor|2> Cork: Oh, it was not pseudo code... "arguments" is a variable...
[15:16:21] <Cork> ya
[15:16:42] <rewte> sorry.. yeah to me?
[15:16:56] <Cork> rewte: well i would prob change so it loads a jquery-1.11.min.js or something like that
[15:17:02] <Cork> instead of replacing the original
[15:17:24] <Cork> as the version number is in the file name
[15:17:41] <Cork> (also note i haven't touched any cms in years)
[15:17:58] <rewte> Hmmmm... this is at the edge of my understanding....not really a programmer
[15:18:00] <Cork> (to my profound happiness)
[15:18:01] <berpcor|2> Cork: So, it is reserved name of variable by default for any function of API?
[15:18:18] <berpcor|2> But when I redeclare it, I do not get any error...
[15:18:21] <Cork> berpcor|2: no not reserved
[15:18:31] <Cork> berpcor|2: it is a default defined local variable
[15:18:40] <decx> update wordpress, 1.7.2 must be wp 3
[15:18:43] <Cork> but you can replace it if you want
[15:20:30] <Cork> berpcor|2: a slight modification of my last example https://jsfiddle.net/z4542w77/1/
[15:21:19] <Jagst3r15> Cork do you have 5min to take a look at a JSBin I made?
[15:22:28] <Cork> Jagst3r15: not unless you link it :)
[15:22:37] <Jagst3r15> http://jsbin.com/hodedo/edit?js,output
[15:22:49] <berpcor|2> Cork: Thank you again.
[15:22:53] <Jagst3r15> I added some logic to handle the src/source additions and removals but it is throwing some errors now
[15:23:49] <Cork> Jagst3r15: videoPlay.get(0).find('source') <--
[15:24:04] <Cork> .get(0) is the same as videoPlay[0]
[15:24:12] <Cork> it will give you the raw dom element
[15:24:36] <Cork> if you want to use jquery you need to get the wrapped jquery element
[15:24:47] <Jagst3r15> on which line Cork?
[15:24:54] <Cork> also you don't need to filter out a single element with .eq(0)
[15:25:00] <Cork> just do videoPlay.find()
[15:25:07] <Cork> Jagst3r15: several lines
[15:25:36] <berpcor|2> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/6bt118vu/
[15:25:42] <Cork> you should basically remove all .get(0) and .eq(0) lines except when you do .get(0).play()
[15:26:21] <Cork> (well and .pause() and .stop())
[15:26:32] <Jagst3r15> Cork so I can replace videoPlay.get(0).find('source').remove(); with videoPlay.find('source').remove();
[15:26:36] <Cork> berpcor|2: dosomething() executes the function
[15:26:44] <Cork> berpcor|2: you want to pass it as a reference so no ()
[15:26:53] <Cork> Jagst3r15: yes
[15:27:07] <Cork> videoPlay is just $(this) anyway
[15:27:12] <Cork> so it is just one element to begin with
[15:28:05] <Cork> berpcor|2: also variables isn't defined in the function declaration
[15:28:07] <Jagst3r15> Cork...like this? http://jsbin.com/hodedo/edit?js,output
[15:28:24] <Cork> function doSomethin()<--- {}
[15:28:59] <Cork> Jagst3r15: no find() isn't valid
[15:29:10] <Cork> you don't need find if you don't want to find another element
[15:29:26] <Jagst3r15> on what line sir?
[15:29:36] <Cork> just do videoPlay.<function>
[15:29:47] <Cork> ex videoPlay.prop()
[15:30:36] <berpcor|2> Cork: So, again, I should see the docs and find out what arguments function gets by default and to get it inside  my function I should declare it in function doSomething(e){...}?
[15:30:53] <decx> really gotta slag that click function Jagst3r15 there's too much going on in there
[15:31:19] <Cork> berpcor|2: you can name it what ever you like
[15:31:21] <Jagst3r15> decx I will optimize it after, taplar already showed me how to do most of that
[15:31:26] <Jagst3r15> I just need to fix this socket issue
[15:31:26] <Cork> berpcor|2: the documentation is to know what the content is
[15:31:49] <Cork> berpcor|2: function doSomething(fi, fa, fo, fum) {} is totally valid (and will work)
[15:32:16] <decx> just write your own callback once then you'll understand
[15:32:34] <Cork> ya
[15:32:51] <berpcor|2> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/6bt118vu/1/ doesn't seems to be working...
[15:32:52] <Jagst3r15> Cork - like this? http://jsbin.com/hodedo/edit?js,output ... if so that throws an error
[15:33:14] <Cork> berpcor|2: well you need to use the variable you picked :)
[15:33:17] <Cork> and not "variables"
[15:33:44] <berpcor|2> Cork: Variables is defaulr for pure API functions?
[15:34:06] <Cork> no
[15:34:35] <Cork> Jagst3r15: ok i don't know why that one fails
[15:34:59] <Cork> need a bit more to go on then "throws errors"
[15:36:37] <Cork> berpcor|2: the only "magic" variables you need to remember for functions are "this" and "arguments" the rest are explicit
[15:37:16] <berpcor|2> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/6bt118vu/1/
[15:37:33] <Cork> forgot to hit update
[15:37:43] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/6bt118vu/2/
[15:37:58] <berpcor|2> Both isn't working...
[15:38:14] <Cork> berpcor|2: doSomething(CustomNameForArgument) <--
[15:38:26] <Cork> .log(variables) <--
[15:38:26] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 "variables" is not defined anywhere.
[15:38:30] <Cork> those need to be the same
[15:38:35] <Cork> what ever name you pick
[15:38:55] <robertmaxrees> console.log(variables); >- console.log(CustomNameForArgument);
[15:39:15] <Jagst3r15> Cork so http://jsbin.com/hodedo/edit?js,output the erros I see jquery-1.11.3.js:8234 Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request.
[15:39:31] <Cork> Jagst3r15: ah...
[15:39:35] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 i thought we covered this last week...
[15:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you're htting a browser bug in chrome.
[15:40:04] <Jagst3r15> I think there are ways around it
[15:40:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:40:11] <Jagst3r15> what am I supposed to do, wait 5 months for them to fix it?
[15:40:26] <robertmaxrees> i linked you to fixes last week.  what happened with those?
[15:40:33] <Cork> i would prob load the player in an iframe for chrome
[15:40:37] <Cork> and just reload that page
[15:40:50] <robertmaxrees> (it's really important to provide that context for people so they understand what problem you're trying to solved)
[15:40:52] <robertmaxrees> *solve
[15:41:09] <Jagst3r15> I think I tried a few of those without any luck
[15:41:54] <Jagst3r15> needless to say my code isn't the cleanest but Chrome is being a piece of crap
[15:42:12] <Cork> most browsers are...
[15:42:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm just pointing out that it's really salient to tell people that the issue you're having is due to a confirmed browser bug.
[15:42:23] <berpcor|2> Cork: Variables are passed to function no matter if I use it or not. How does interpreter knows when he should insert some unknown for ma value instead of parameters I set for functions? And how does he knows exactly what he should replace?..
[15:42:33] <berpcor|2> *for me
[15:42:52] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees a bug that has been in chrome for 3 years lol
[15:42:59] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 sure, it's still a bug.
[15:43:01] <Cork> berpcor|2: all arguments end up in the arguments variable
[15:43:10] <Jagst3r15> well the fixes i have tried dont work
[15:43:18] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 that's fine, it's still relevant information.
[15:43:22] <Cork> berpcor|2: the arguments are mapped from left to right as long as there are any value to enter (or variable to put in them)
[15:43:27] <robertmaxrees> not providing that context throws people in a loop.
[15:43:41] <Cork> berpcor|2: if there are any argument variables left they become undefined
[15:44:01] <berpcor|2> Cork: Got it. Then...
[15:44:57] <Jagst3r15> I think I am just S.O.L. (:
[15:45:51] <robertmaxrees> cork provided an option up above.
[15:46:40] <Jagst3r15> Cork what do you mean by load the player in an iframe sir?
[15:47:00] <Cork> instead of embedding the player directly in the main page
[15:47:15] <Cork> create a separate page with just that part of the html/js
[15:47:28] <Cork> and when the video ends just do window.reload() in the iframe
[15:47:38] <Cork> and the entire dom will be thrown away
[15:47:43] <berpcor|2> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/3z4knvnt/1/
[15:47:48] <Jagst3r15> won't there be a visible refresh?
[15:47:54] <Cork> if that doesn't close the socket then nothing you can do will
[15:48:09] <Cork> Jagst3r15: sure, but so will removing the video element
[15:48:21] <Jagst3r15> why?
[15:48:29] <Jagst3r15> aren't you just swapping the source?
[15:48:30] <Cork> uh... cause your removing the image?
[15:48:44] <Cork> Jagst3r15: the fix you lined did video.remove()
[15:48:49] <Cork> *linked
[15:49:34] <Jagst3r15> Cork my solution was based on that. I am storing the source as a variable and then adding/removing it based on video start/end
[15:49:58] <Cork> i don't think removing source elements will cause the socket to close
[15:50:04] <Jagst3r15> hm
[15:50:18] <Jagst3r15> well shit
[15:54:02] <berpcor|2> Cork: Are you still here? Too many questions? )
[15:54:23] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel
[15:54:36] <Cork> berpcor|2: you dind't ask a question as far as i saw
[15:54:44] <Jagst3r15> obertmaxrees...how come this one doesn't throw that promises error (http://output.jsbin.com/patipal) and this one does (http://jsbin.com/hodedo/edit?output)
[15:54:48] <Jagst3r15> doesn't make any sense
[15:55:06] <Cork> (writing the question in the pb is normally not the best choice)
[15:55:18] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[15:55:31] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/3z4knvnt/1/
[15:55:56] <berpcor|2> it was at [02:47:44] )
[15:55:58] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 in chrome you mean?
[15:56:10] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees yeah
[15:56:24] <Cork> berpcor|2: if you by redeclare what happens if an argument has the name as a higher scope variable
[15:56:25] <Jagst3r15> I did a diff and there isn't much difference
[15:56:39] <Cork> berpcor|2: then the answer is that you can't reach the higher variable
[15:56:42] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 how are you triggering the error?
[15:56:46] <Cork> as the name gets taken locally
[15:57:28] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees by going to the end of the initial video and the trying to click on one of the "click me" lis
[15:57:36] <Cork> berpcor|2: my point was that you should ask the question in the channel, and not just link a pb
[15:57:52] <Cork> berpcor|2: else ppl tend to miss the question (as you didn't ask one)
[15:58:11] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 so what are the differences between the two?
[15:58:39] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees https://www.diffchecker.com/c0z6mdta
[15:58:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:58:54] <robertmaxrees> so what does that mean to you?
[15:59:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking you to look at it and experiment.
[15:59:33] <berpcor|2> Cork: Another words, again, docs should also give me information what exactly arguments (order number) I should use to pass my own ones for I could not override usefull information?..
[15:59:58] <berpcor|2> Cork: Ok, I'll ask the questions in the channel.
[16:00:00] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 the docs imply the order of the arguments.
[16:00:11] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 you can name them whatever you want in your callbacks.
[16:00:17] <Cork> ya
[16:00:23] <Cork> the docs give you what they contain
[16:00:26] <robertmaxrees> it's apart of knowing the language.
[16:00:28] <Cork> not what you my name them
[16:00:31] <robertmaxrees> and the library
[16:02:33] <berpcor|2> You didn't understand the last sentence. ) I mean that indirectly I can get knowledge about how I can pass my own data to function without missing the information which is passed to a function by API or some plugin. But I understood you. )
[16:02:48] <berpcor|2> *which is already passed
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can't really do that.
[16:03:06] <taplar> so much confusion over parameters
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> you can't "override" whatever the api specifies as the callback arguments.
[16:03:26] <Cork> well you can
[16:03:29] <Cork> with .bind()
[16:03:34] <Cork> but i wouldn't recommend it
[16:03:52] <robertmaxrees> right, but that's a whole different beast imo.
[16:03:56] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees hmm.. videoPlay.prop('src', ''); and videoPlay.find('source').remove(); in the } else if (jQuery(this).hasClass('false')) { statement are the cause...
[16:04:00] <Cork> ya
[16:04:22] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 so what does that tell you?
[16:04:28] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/6bt118vu/4/
[16:04:30] <Cork> berpcor|2: do you know about scope inheritance?
[16:04:33] <berpcor|2> The next question )
[16:05:05] <Cork> berpcor|2: uh...
[16:05:12] <Cork> variable still isn't defined...
[16:06:07] * Cork feels like this is going in a loop...
[16:06:11] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees maybe the stuff I am doing to the source messes it up
[16:06:22] <Jagst3r15> it is being triggered too soon
[16:06:34] <berpcor|2> I can't understand it...Why not? When you call test(), you pass arguments there.
[16:06:37] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 right, do you remember anything about the core bug?
[16:06:47] <berpcor|2> So, variables is set.
[16:06:52] <Cork> berpcor|2: cause like i told you several times
[16:06:55] <berpcor|2> Jquery do the same.
[16:07:01] <Cork> arguments is a special variable
[16:07:03] <taplar> jquery is javascript
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 right.
[16:07:13] <Cork> berpcor|2: it gets implicitly defined by the language
[16:07:18] <robertmaxrees> err, taplar is right.
[16:07:23] <berpcor|2> I understand it. It is just a function wit a name of $
[16:07:39] <berpcor|2> *object
[16:07:42] <Cork> berpcor|2: if you want to define an argument variable you need to define it
[16:07:47] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees well wasn't it something to do with an event firing right after play?
[16:07:49] <Cork> you can't just invent a name and use it
[16:08:06] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 it has to do with using things in the wrong order, basically.
[16:08:29] <Cork> berpcor|2: https://jsfiddle.net/6bt118vu/5/
[16:09:04] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees right
[16:09:15] <Cork> berpcor|2: like i told you a while ago there are two magic variables "this" and "arguments"
[16:09:23] <Cork> the rest are explicitly defined for every function
[16:09:36] <robertmaxrees> *as arguments
[16:10:20] <taplar> *should be explicitly...
[16:10:41] <Cork> i meant it as if you don't define them they won't exist
[16:12:26] <berpcor|2> But variables is magic, I shouldn't define it...
[16:12:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:12:37] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing things.
[16:12:38] <Cork> uh...
[16:12:47] <robertmaxrees> let's show you a contrived example.
[16:12:56] <berpcor|2> Confusing? Yes, I guess. But I want to understand...
[16:13:12] <Jagst3r15> Cork I think this method works
[16:13:14] <Jagst3r15> (:
[16:13:33] <Jagst3r15> I am monitoring the sockets in chrome://net-internals/#sockets and they don't go over 1 now
[16:14:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zouzvbgr/
[16:14:30] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 really contrived, but see how giveMeACallback takes an argument and calls it with someFunction('foo', 'bar');?
[16:17:00] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees it's finally working :D
[16:17:36] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:17:44] <Jagst3r15> what a pain in the d!ck
[16:17:55] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: I understand you example, as I think. Let me rephrase my question one more time...
[16:17:59] <Jagst3r15> now I need to clean up my code based on what taplar gave me
[16:18:01] <Jagst3r15> (:
[16:18:04] <Jagst3r15> thank you all
[16:18:08] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 your question means that you don't understand :)
[16:18:42] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: You are right, probably. I try to find a way to your answer then...
[16:19:25] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 basically, giveMeACallback specified what gets sent to the callback.
[16:19:27] <robertmaxrees> period.
[16:19:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't.  at all.  your function can optionally accept each of those arguments.  or it can ignore them.  that part is up to you.
[16:19:45] <berpcor|2> Moment, I'll create a jsfiddle...
[16:30:46] <robertmaxrees> [moment intensifies]
[16:31:20] <taplar> kelly clarkson?
[16:31:31] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 said it'd be a moment.  very long moment.
[16:31:42] <berpcor|2> )
[16:31:49] <berpcor|2> Minute more, please...
[16:33:35] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/51s8q982/
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:34:11] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:34:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> try asking in the channel.
[16:35:09] <taplar> your not including jquery in your fiddle
[16:35:15] <robertmaxrees> also, you want to now why the "arguments" variable isn't defined in https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/51s8q982/1/
[16:35:28] <robertmaxrees> because you aren't referencing "arguments", you're referencing "variables"
[16:36:05] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Oh, do you mean from the upper level, so to speak?
[16:36:10] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 huh?>
[16:36:16] <taplar> ln 20
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> the actually object is named "arguments"
[16:36:20] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's called.
[16:37:01] <robertmaxrees> *actual
[16:37:23] <robertmaxrees> console.log(arguments); would work because that's what it's called.
[16:38:01] <berpcor|2> Damn...
[16:38:09] <taplar> ?
[16:38:11] <berpcor|2> My mistake was just...
[16:38:25] <berpcor|2> The wrong name of magic variable...
[16:38:28] <berpcor|2> 0_0
[16:38:32] <robertmaxrees> that's what Cork kept saying earlier.  The two magical objects are "arguments" and "this".  that's what they're called.
[16:38:42] * taplar dislikes 'magical'
[16:38:47] <berpcor|2> It was just a typo ))
[16:38:53] <robertmaxrees> i do, too, but that's what they kept telling him.
[16:38:54] <berpcor|2> And it was the reason...
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid using the "arguments" btw.
[16:39:10] <robertmaxrees> explicitly pass things.
[16:39:22] <berpcor|2> You just need to tell word 'typo' )
[16:39:38] <robertmaxrees> i didn't know if you were confused or not by what it was called.
[16:40:02] <robertmaxrees> people kept correcting you on that and you kept not changing it.
[16:40:34] <berpcor|2> Thank you a lot for your patience.
[16:40:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah def
[16:43:19] <berpcor|2> Cork: Thank you too. My bad. My inattention.)
[17:26:29] <taplar> too much fun...
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> hahhahah
[17:27:24] <robertmaxrees> sure yeah that, while i'm working old IE bugs.
[17:28:14] <taplar> glad I don't have to mess with those, :)
[17:28:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:30:33] <taplar> old IE, bugs.  or old, IE bugs ?
[17:30:48] <robertmaxrees> bugs that happen only in Old IE.
[17:31:14] <robertmaxrees> being basically the only frontend guy on windows means I deal with most of these.
[17:31:36] <taplar> what's the oldest IE you guys see hitting your site?
[17:31:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahah that's not what I care about but I think we'll see 6 crop up.
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> but we only go back to 8.
[17:32:08] <taplar> ah
[17:32:22] <robertmaxrees> we make enough money on it to make it worthwhile.
[17:32:52] <taplar> i still remember when 7 came out and you could no longer open a popup fullscreen.  my first app here almost lost it's s*
[17:33:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:37:39] <taplar> hmm, you ever seen one of these videos about NeoKylin?
[17:38:02] <robertmaxrees> i heard about it.
[17:38:19] <taplar> at least graphically it looks like an xp clone
[17:39:58] <taplar> i thought they were trying to get ubuntu to make them an os
[17:41:30] <robertmaxrees> who knows.
[17:41:32] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:43:58] <Z3R0> quick q, I was looking at the onchange event for select, I am using an object, however the value of the options is the id, and the display is display_name, I would like to be able to also select the description of the object, from the onchange event, but I don’t have access to the object from select because it doesn’t exist yet (it’s foreached, within the select as options…) any thoughts?
[17:44:18] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you mean?
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> like in a fiddle?
[17:44:38] <Z3R0> sure sec
[17:45:08] <Z3R0> soon as my net starts cooperating
[17:45:23] <Z3R0> or is fiddle down?
[17:45:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ is up here.
[17:46:06] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: As I remember, you asked me if I understand scoping in javascript or not. I read documentation now, and now my answer is no, I didn't understand it. It absolutely different from php I often work with. Everything I knew and did using javascript was on intuitive level...
[17:46:25] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what thing was thgat?
[17:46:52] <Z3R0> https://gist.github.com/SeoRoman/5426e4317a2dc31c5601472bdd3280c5
[17:46:56] <Z3R0> weird wouldn’t load here
[17:47:19] <robertmaxrees> Z3R0 errr... shgow me html.
[17:47:21] <robertmaxrees> rendered markup.
[17:47:24] <robertmaxrees> not templating.
[17:47:28] <Z3R0> ya sorry one sec
[17:47:34] <Z3R0> realized that afterwards
[17:48:05] <taplar> also your mixing inline bindings and nested functions
[17:48:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:48:24] <robertmaxrees> onchange is bad.
[17:48:25] <taplar> event will not be available in the global scope, iirc
[17:48:37] <robertmaxrees> .oin('change', function() {}) is what you want.
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> function event() { exists outside of scope for you.
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> so you can't access is there anyway.
[17:49:05] <Z3R0> well I got all that… the problem is accessing the data I want
[17:49:14] <robertmaxrees> "accessing the data" meaning...
[17:49:15] <Z3R0> because the object is there (via php) but the data isn’t displayed anywhere
[17:49:26] <taplar> uh, js can't access php
[17:49:28] <robertmaxrees> so do you output it to the page?
[17:49:35] <robertmaxrees> because if you don't, JS and PHP don't mix.
[17:49:38] <Z3R0> for instance, value = $object->id and display = $object->display_name…. but I want to utilize $object->description (but it’s not on the frontend anywhere…) so yea...
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> js knows DOM.
[17:49:50] <taplar> js = client, php = server
[17:49:50] <Z3R0> ok, so it HAS to be displayed somewhere, even if it’s a hidden input or something
[17:49:52] <robertmaxrees> so you need to print that to the page somehow.
[17:49:59] <robertmaxrees> print out an object.
[17:50:22] <Z3R0> ^ ?
[17:50:26] <taplar> throw them in hidden fields
[17:50:30] <taplar> or something
[17:50:31] <robertmaxrees> eeeehhhh...
[17:50:44] <Z3R0> I could do hidden, just wasn’t sure if that was the way to go
[17:50:46] <taplar> idk, something with data elements maybe?
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> you could do something like var window.myData = YOURDATAHERE; where YOURDATAHERE is output with a JSON encoding lib or something similar.
[17:50:53] <Z3R0> hmmm data might work
[17:51:18] <robertmaxrees> he have a thing here called "dataLayer" that contains that kinds of stuff.
[17:52:48] <taplar> you talking about a model?
[17:53:12] <robertmaxrees> heh, no.  this was more of a stopgap before we widely adopted bootstrap.
[17:55:32] <Z3R0> what’s teh opposite of closest() for transversal ?
[17:55:38] <taplar> if object description is unique to the select, yeah i'd stick it on the select as a data
[17:55:40] <robertmaxrees> .find() is similar.
[17:56:03] <Z3R0> does that go from SelectA.find(selectorB) .. will it stop on first selector match ?
[17:56:17] <robertmaxrees> no.  that finds all descendents that match your selector.
[17:56:31] <Z3R0> anythign that transverses downward, to next ?
[17:56:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:57] <Z3R0> closest(selector) transverses up to next matching selector
[17:57:04] <Z3R0> but not “all” just closest...
[17:57:11] <Z3R0> I want inverse, next matching, downward...
[17:57:25] <taplar> you can always get eq(0)
[17:57:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:57:29] <Z3R0> but not “all” matching downwards
[17:57:38] <robertmaxrees> there is no direct analogue for what you want.
[17:57:46] <decx> querySelector
[17:57:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:58:02] <robertmaxrees> decx--
[17:58:09] <decx> :o
[17:58:43] <Z3R0> ah .first() ;)
[17:58:50] <Z3R0> $(this).find(‘.x’).first()
[17:58:53] <taplar> wrapper for eq(0) sure
[17:58:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:58:59] <robertmaxrees> same diff.
[17:59:00] <Z3R0> probbaly
[17:59:04] <robertmaxrees> not the same as .closest() fwiw.
[18:00:10] <taplar> your after the first one
[18:00:13] <taplar> is there more than one?
[18:00:23] <taplar> maybe dumb question
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> .closest() starts at the current element and goes up.  it could match on the element you started with :)
[18:00:38] <robertmaxrees> and depending on the kind of structure you have, .find() should be fine.
[18:01:58] <taplar> ooc, what was your negative with querySelector?
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> now you're in native DOM land, which means you need to get back to jquery land.  or maybe you don't.
[18:02:43] <decx> right it doesnt matter unless you have a shit load of .x
[18:03:01] <eddy> hi guys i want to create something generate those html elements http://kopy.io/GH3uZ from this data https://jsfiddle.net/zz6t49kf/1/
[18:03:06] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're doing and how much you want to confuse the next guy who comes along.
[18:03:47] <taplar> console.log instead of alert pls!
[18:03:56] <eddy> the kopi shows an example of what i want then jsfiddle shows the json. i will like to those that for each record and append it to the "accordin" id
[18:04:02] <eddy> how do i start please
[18:05:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't use alerts
[18:05:05] <taplar> anyway, i'm gonna head out and play with the homework assingments, errr, traffic lights
[18:05:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:05:30] <taplar> going to be a while before i forget that one
[18:05:47] <robertmaxrees> so eddy what are you trying to accomplish?
[18:05:53] <robertmaxrees> that inner $.each() is totally unnecessarily.
[18:05:58] <robertmaxrees> *unnecessary
[18:06:01] <eddy> robertmaxrees, the end result should look like this http://kopy.io/3cmAc
[18:06:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not very good markup.
[18:06:22] <decx> the alerts
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> can you move that h3 inside the div?
[18:06:52] <robertmaxrees> and you could .map().get().join(''); this pretty easilly.
[18:08:06] <decx> accordion is weird like that
[18:08:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:08:21] <eddy> robertmaxrees, am still an amater with jquery
[18:08:32] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what part is confusing?
[18:08:50] <eddy> ideally i want to create those html elements and add it inside the accordion
[18:08:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:08:59] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost with my explanation?
[18:09:15] <eddy> so it end up looking like this https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGgvwO76KWTYXFLNXR3Tkw3bGs
[18:09:24] <eddy> dont know how to do it robertmaxrees
[18:09:37] <decx> you want a template of sort
[18:09:49] <robertmaxrees> i just explained one way.  or you could use a templating engine of some kind.
[18:10:34] <eddy> robertmaxrees, but i still need to generate the html for each of the values in the json
[18:10:41] <robertmaxrees> ... right.
[18:10:49] <robertmaxrees> we're explained a few different ways to do that.
[18:11:09] <robertmaxrees> *we've  - could you explain where you're confused or lost so we can help?
[18:11:46] <eddy> so h3 will have the id, type, exp_month and exp_year
[18:12:03] <robertmaxrees> so do you not know how to make elements with jquery?
[18:12:10] <decx> good
[18:12:11] <eddy> then robertmaxrees year
[18:12:14] <eddy> yea*
[18:12:15] <decx> dont go down that route
[18:12:21] <decx> use a real template
[18:12:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use a templating engine instead if you can/.
[18:12:37] <robertmaxrees> you can do this with jquery but it's pretty gross.
[18:12:51] <eddy> will the template generate the html structure for each of the records in the json decx
[18:12:56] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:13:01] <robertmaxrees> that's what a templating engine dooes.
[18:13:02] <robertmaxrees> *does
[18:13:09] <robertmaxrees> you feed it a format and your data and it spits out HTML.
[18:13:35] <eddy> robertmaxrees, [{"id":"card_187wcdHV08ug7","type":"Visa","cardno":"**** 4242","exp_month":6,"exp_year":2019, "fee": 0.50},{"id":"card_189KaFH","type":"MasterCard","cardno":"**** 4444","exp_month":5,"exp_year":2017, "fee": 0.50}];
[18:13:39] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/zz6t49kf/3/ here's the most simple template system you'll find. but it gives you an idea
[18:13:42] <robertmaxrees> i looked at the fiddle, dude.
[18:13:45] <eddy> that is what i get back from the jquery ajax
[18:14:03] <eddy> so i need to structure it and style it into the htm
[18:14:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:14:13] <robertmaxrees> we know exactly what you need to do.
[18:14:17] <robertmaxrees> we're offering solutions.
[18:14:23] <decx> eddy: check the fiddle
[18:14:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to phrase this.
[18:16:00] <eddy> decx, https://jsfiddle.net/zz6t49kf/4/
[18:16:14] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:16:30] <decx> so add your div to the template
[18:16:32] <eddy> when you click on it it should expand those show https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByGgvwO76KWTYXFLNXR3Tkw3bGs
[18:16:33] <decx> magic
[18:16:46] <robertmaxrees> eddy right, he'd not doing it for you.
[18:16:59] <robertmaxrees> he's given you an example.  build upon it :)
[18:17:02] <eddy> robertmaxrees, i know
[18:17:06] <decx> and this template function is just an example too
[18:17:23] <decx> it's pretty damn cool and short, but any mature template system will be better
[18:17:57] <eddy> decx, you have a recommandation?
[18:18:06] <decx> i like handlebars with jquery
[18:18:15] <eddy> your example is good but i dont like it because it has "script"
[18:18:21] <eddy> it the html body
[18:18:30] <decx> doesnt matter where you get the template html string from
[18:18:37] <robertmaxrees> if you already have underscore in your project you could use that, too.
[18:18:43] <decx> right
[18:18:57] <robertmaxrees> lots of options.
[18:31:34] <robertmaxrees> aaand it's quiet again
[18:33:41] <eddy> doesnt work for me decx
[18:33:49] <robertmaxrees> show us what you tried.
[18:33:54] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't work" doesn't tell us anything.
[18:34:59] <eddy> http://kopy.io/0eth8
[18:35:10] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[18:35:12] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[18:35:28] <eddy> dont done
[18:35:33] <decx> you dont declare a function in another function
[18:35:33] <robertmaxrees> also, you're initializing the accordionbefore you append the elements.
[18:35:40] <decx> dont just copy and paste
[18:35:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:36:29] <eddy> http://kopy.io/EL5rU
[18:36:42] <eddy> robertmaxrees,
[18:36:43] <eddy> Uncaught TypeError: data.map is not a function
[18:37:05] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[18:37:12] <robertmaxrees> what is "data" here?
[18:37:16] <robertmaxrees> simplate2 ?
[18:37:17] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:37:39] <decx> ©
[18:37:49] <robertmaxrees> you're changing things on us.
[18:38:09] <decx> doesnt make sense what you do here
[18:38:17] <decx> you can create a templaet string like that
[18:38:25] <decx> but not with accordion and not with the id
[18:38:55] <eddy> data is a jquery ajax to a php server which then feed back a json
[18:39:00] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:39:04] <eddy> which is shown in the original jsfiddle
[18:39:20] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:39:43] <eddy> that template thing wouldnt work
[18:39:44] <robertmaxrees> way fractured :) update http://kopy.io/0eth8 with whatever is relevant.
[18:39:47] <robertmaxrees> it would.
[18:39:50] <eddy> they should ne another way
[18:39:58] <robertmaxrees> you just aren't using correctly.
[18:40:07] <robertmaxrees> there's no data var there fwiw.
[18:40:17] <robertmaxrees> i think you meant to pass "d"
[18:40:25] <eddy> robertmaxrees, http://kopy.io/0eth8 line 3
[18:40:31] <eddy> and line 7
[18:40:46] <decx> you still init the accordion before it has content
[18:41:02] <decx> and you still use the function i told you not to use
[18:41:08] <robertmaxrees> eddief1 then d isn't what you think it is.
[18:41:11] <decx> and it's still inside a function
[18:41:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:41:29] <eddy> which which function did you tell me not to you?
[18:41:53] <decx> we told you to use a real engine
[18:42:01] <decx> i remember specific examples
[18:42:08] <robertmaxrees> like handlebars or the one in underscote.
[18:42:08] <decx> namely handlebars and underscore
[18:42:11] <robertmaxrees> *underscore
[18:42:12] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:42:17] <decx> you go to these pages
[18:42:23] <decx> and they will teach you how to use them
[18:42:27] <eddy> am confused and lost
[18:42:59] <robertmaxrees> about what?
[18:43:13] <eddy> "we told you to use a real engine"
[18:43:16] <eddy> which engine?
[18:43:22] <robertmaxrees> we just renamed 2.
[18:43:27] <eddy> "namely handlebars and underscore"
[18:43:30] <eddy> what is that?
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:43:35] <robertmaxrees> templating engines.
[18:43:48] <decx> you even asked me for an exmaple
[18:43:55] <decx> how do you not remember what we wrote like 10 minutes ago
[18:44:08] <robertmaxrees> what about those sentences is ambiguous?
[18:45:52] <eddy> i didnt knwo underscore is some type of library
[18:45:57] <eddy> know*
[18:46:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.  that was implied when we brought it up :)
[18:48:29] <decx> you have the patience of a saint
[18:48:35] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[18:48:37] <robertmaxrees> i try :)
[18:48:43] <decx> meanwhile i go off on people at the slightest chance ^^
[18:49:41] <robertmaxrees> honestly i think a lot of the problem is folks never know where to start and can't figure out how to break their problem down.
[18:50:31] <eddy> jquery aint my thing
[18:50:35] <eddy> C# .net is
[18:50:47] <robertmaxrees> a lot of your confusion has nothing to do with jquery and more to do with javascript.
[18:50:50] <eddy> i try to do bits and pieces with jquery
[18:51:14] <eddy> unfornately this project started with jquery before me other wise i will use angularjs
[18:51:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:51:29] <robertmaxrees> they do two different things.
[18:51:34] <robertmaxrees> in fact, many people use them together.
[18:53:17] <eddy> i like jquery when i am doign simple things but when i try to do things new thats when i dont understand the logic of jquery
[18:54:08] <eddy> logically i thought all i added to do was loop over each json then assign wach of the values in the json to a html element i wanted and then render it
[18:54:16] <eddy> but that wasn't the case
[18:54:27] <decx> well you can do it that way, but it's hell to maintain
[18:54:37] <arc_> all jquery does is give you a way to more easily select sets of elements, and methods to operate on them
[18:54:44] <arc_> anything outside of that is javascript
[18:54:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:54:58] <arc_> like loops for example
[18:55:05] <jnewt> https://jsfiddle.net/hhtdopdx/3/  i'm trying to understand how to use history.  i have the fwd/ back working, but refresh breaks everything because it loads only the content, not the rest of my index page.
[18:55:11] <robertmaxrees> templating engines are much easier to use for things like that eddy
[18:55:33] <eddy> yea but thats something i have to learn again which might take days
[18:55:42] <eddy> just to do something that is simple
[18:55:51] <robertmaxrees> sounds like really you just need a crash course in JS and jquery
[18:57:00] <eddy> maybe robertmaxrees
[18:57:10] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, that decx showed you is the rough idea.
[18:57:14] <eddy> if i had that much interest in front end development
[18:57:26] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[18:57:36] <robertmaxrees> trying to save you headaches mano.
[18:58:25] <eddy> ideally i got save the html from php but that is really bad practice which i dont want to do ahaha
[18:58:29] <robertmaxrees> and it's less about interest and more about need.
[18:59:11] <eddy> robertmaxrees, my html are not standard along they are embbed in a javascript function
[18:59:24] <eddy> which is why you saw that b+=
[18:59:24] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:59:29] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:59:34] <robertmaxrees> that's just called string concatenation.
[18:59:53] <eddy> so how will do add that to the understand stuff
[19:00:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:00:09] <arc_> are you typing on a phone
[19:00:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm really confused.
[19:00:31] <arc_> i thought maybe "standard along" was supposed to be standalone
[19:00:48] <robertmaxrees> ooor and "understand" should be "underscore"
[19:00:53] <robertmaxrees> *oooh
[19:00:59] <eddy> arc_, am tried lol
[19:01:01] <arc_> lol, autocorrect
[19:01:13] <robertmaxrees> http://underscorejs.org/#template
[19:01:46] <eddy> robertmaxrees, all my html are mixed with javascript something like this http://kopy.io/EL5rU
[19:01:53] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[19:01:56] <robertmaxrees> that's the wrong way to do that.
[19:02:00] <robertmaxrees> you want a templating engine.
[19:02:09] <eddy> robertmaxrees, too late to change it
[19:02:37] <robertmaxrees> it wasn't too late what, 30 minutes ago?
[19:02:39] <eddy> underscore wouldnt work with the way this was structure
[19:02:51] <robertmaxrees> which is why you don't use that structure.
[19:02:56] <eddy> took 1500 of 2 people to get this project where it is
[19:03:03] <eddy> 1500 hours
[19:03:11] <robertmaxrees> very minimal changes would be needed for that part to work.
[19:03:17] <robertmaxrees> are you building an ecommerce system?
[19:03:25] <eddy> robertmaxrees, it is
[19:03:35] <robertmaxrees> :) you have my sympathy - that's the industry I work in.
[19:03:37] <decx> your template would just be lines 6,7,9
[19:03:52] <robertmaxrees> you want to get payment selection and those things right.  do not take shortcuts with that code.
[19:03:53] <decx> you can feed that into any templating engine as that string
[19:04:00] <eddy> decx, it just a small set of what i need to do
[19:04:24] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you really need some client-side templating love then.
[19:04:27] <eddy> is they another library apart from underscore?
[19:04:37] <robertmaxrees> the one decx mentioned.
[19:07:20] <eddy> decx, with the example you show https://jsfiddle.net/zz6t49kf/4/
[19:07:41] <eddy> why did i get an error when i tried to do it here http://kopy.io/0eth8
[19:07:53] <eddy> the error was Uncaught TypeError: data.map is not a function
[19:08:03] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with his code btw.
[19:08:14] <robertmaxrees> what is "data" inside that function?
[19:08:29] <decx> the function expects and array of objects
[19:08:33] <decx> -d
[19:08:48] <robertmaxrees> are you getting back a json string perhaps?
[19:09:01] <robertmaxrees> try a console.log(typeof data) in that function - what do you get?
[19:09:42] <eddy> d is a json
[19:09:56] <robertmaxrees> do that console log in thet function.
[19:09:59] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[19:10:14] <eddy> 1 sec
[19:11:07] <eddy> robertmaxrees, its a string
[19:11:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:11:12] <robertmaxrees> see the problem?
[19:11:24] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to run an array method on a string.
[19:11:39] <robertmaxrees> need to parse the JSON out before you can work with it.
[19:11:59] <decx> better to have the server send the right type instead tho
[19:12:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:12:13] <robertmaxrees> unless the JSON library outputs it as a string.
[19:12:21] <robertmaxrees> in which case, you'll have to parse client-side
[19:12:46] <decx> and build your query string with an object
[19:14:27] <eddy> JSON.parse
[19:14:31] <eddy> did the json
[19:14:34] <robertmaxrees> client-side, sure.
[19:14:45] <eddy> decx, i will use your example in jsfiddle thanks
[19:15:00] <decx> you need to restructure some stuff
[19:15:02] <decx> let's see
[19:19:07] <decx> eddy check it out https://jsfiddle.net/07w55tyj/
[19:30:36] <eddy> decx, thank you so much
[20:13:29] <sjclark> Hello =) Does anyone have any experience with Velocity.js (and potentially jQuery animation delays / queuing?) - I'm looking for some help with a basic animation chain
[20:13:44] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and ask your questiuon.  if somebody can help, they will.
[20:16:14] <sjclark> Ok thanks =) Essentially, I have an (svg) triangle with text at each corner (grey by default)
[20:16:24] <sjclark> *bah... gimme a sec
[20:16:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to give you a big ProTip™ here and point out that you should setup a jsfiddle instead.
[20:16:39] <robertmaxrees> and then ask your question.
[20:17:11] <sjclark> :P I'm going to paste imgur & jsfiddle, just got the newline character wrong
[20:17:33] <robertmaxrees> err, no newlines in IRC :)
[20:17:47] <robertmaxrees> as in, your question shouldn't need that much explanation :)
[20:21:44] <sjclark> Essentially I have an SVG Triangle with some text at each corner (http://i.imgur.com/2teJy1N.png). What I'm attempting to do is have the triangle rotate (120 degrees, over 1000ms) and have the text thats pointed to toggle to orange text. This then repeats - ie. triangle spins... pointing at text.. which toggles classes. I have a pretty strong grasp
[20:21:44] <sjclark>  of HTML/CSS, but I'm still in process of acquainting myself with JS. Trying to get my head around .delay .queue setInterval etc. Currently I have very terrible hacky velocity code (https://jsfiddle.net/zp3y2rag/)
[20:22:03] <robertmaxrees> wee.
[20:22:10] <robertmaxrees> *err, you're thinking about this the wrong way.\
[20:22:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:22:23] <robertmaxrees> also: put your markup in the html section.
[20:27:20] <decx> does that just repeat?
[20:27:29] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[20:27:33] <robertmaxrees> callbacks, yo ;)
[20:29:06] <arc_> i know this is not what you're asking about, but shouldn't two of those appear as if they are "active" at a time
[20:30:48] <sjclark> RIGHT: updated (still horrendous jsfiddle) https://jsfiddle.net/zp3y2rag/
[20:31:36] <sjclark> decx: repeats (if you were talking to me?)
[20:31:56] <decx> doesnt look like it repeats
[20:32:01] <sjclark> arc_: ahhh.... yes... or moresos one? One piece of text should be orange at a time
[20:32:16] <decx> i'd just have css animation rules for each of those elements
[20:32:22] <decx> 0 js required
[20:32:33] <sjclark> decx: correct... like i said, its terrible hacky non-looping code, i have the triangle rotating back to 0deg with a 0sec transition
[20:32:33] <decx> or a real svg animation
[20:33:05] <sjclark> decx: i looked into doing SVG animation (tried Adobe Animate & Flash) and found it a terrible headache - some method / tool you'd reccomend?
[20:33:14] <decx> css animation
[20:33:15] <sjclark> I've looked into canvas too... (Same problem)
[20:33:19] <decx> transform
[20:33:29] <decx> what you do in velocity already
[20:33:32] <decx> just without the js
[20:33:39] <jak2000> hi decx! remember me?
[20:33:47] <sjclark> decx: css animations with big delays for the text toggles?
[20:33:50] <jak2000> you created a canvas sample
[20:33:59] <decx> sjclark: right
[20:34:07] <decx> jak2000: yep
[20:34:40] <sjclark> decx: I looked into that for a bit, ended up trying to do keyframe animations with staggered animation delays
[20:35:00] <sjclark> ie nth-child(2) animation-delay: 5000
[20:35:18] <decx> right
[20:35:45] <sjclark> decx: I can't particularly remember why I gave up on that, was like 3 am - you think CSS Animations would be the way to go for this?
[20:36:37] <sjclark> decx: still feel shit having to somewhat hack the positions of the text to match up - have a suspicion svg or canvas is technically what I should be doing but seems like so much overhead. (http://i.imgur.com/2teJy1N.png)
[20:36:54] <SpecialTechnique> Is there some kind of regex to exclude all wording except random number/letter generators? I'm trying to block all pages except anything coming in with /event/a8b8asd91239asd9ad9dasd
[20:41:16] <decx> sjclark: just make a png spritesheet, it's justa few lines so it'll be pretty efficient
[20:41:30] <decx> and you have greater creative control over your animation
[20:42:10] <decx> with css animation it WOULD be pretty lame on further review
[20:43:10] <decx> for canvas you'd have to be familiar with canvas itself, but with an elegant function you could do it in a few lines
[21:38:48] <printForever> I cant run jQuery code in COnsole
[21:38:51] <printForever> its reporting
[21:38:57] <printForever> TypeError: jQuery is undefined
[21:39:04] <printForever> I tried jQuery.noConflict()
[21:39:06] <printForever> I tried $
[21:39:10] <printForever> I tried jQuery()
[21:39:13] <printForever> it wont work...
[21:44:10] <Ou42> maybe this: https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/running-jquery-in-the-browser-console/37817/2
[21:44:58] <printForever> Ou42, I dont get it
[21:45:27] <printForever> Ou42, you've read that I'm unable to use $ because it throws an undefined error?
[21:46:11] <Ou42> the $ is undefined or what you're trying to access?
[22:43:14] <jak2000> decx friend are you there? i need a advice
[23:09:30] <jak2000> i am try: http://jsfiddle.net/pmy1nmuy/16/
