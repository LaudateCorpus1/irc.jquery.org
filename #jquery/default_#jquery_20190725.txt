[11:03:21] <Levin^2> hello
[11:03:34] <Levin^2> I'm having a bit of trouble of making this highlighter work
[11:03:38] <Levin^2> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gVMNBa
[11:05:41] <Levin^2> I'm trying to make the class 'bright' to be removed after .5s
[11:20:03] <emsjessec> is it possible to detect when a jquery selectmenu is selected instead of changed?
[11:20:11] <emsjessec> i'm using it as a page navigation
[11:20:18] <emsjessec> the first item is automatically selected
[11:20:46] <emsjessec> the dropdown gets triggered and i click the first item.  the first item is already selected so 'selectmenuchange' does not fire
[14:19:03] <primitivMedia> https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_filters.asp -- this can be used with a select element and it's option yes?
[14:19:11] <primitivMedia> instead of a table
[14:19:47] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[14:21:45] <primitivMedia> nvm it does

[15:27:24] <Exuma> how do I trigger a click() handler before a submit() handler
[15:27:37] <Exuma> i have a situation where people have to click one of 2 buttons in a form
[15:27:47] <Exuma> but i dont want them to submit the form without clicking one of the buttons
[15:27:54] <Exuma> so i want to trigger an error if they submit via enter
[15:28:10] <Exuma> but the submit() handler keeps getting called first so i cant append what i need to into the form before submit() gets called
[17:13:57] <sioux_> Hi guys. In ajax success, i have this $.each(dataAttachments, function(i, d) {
[17:15:08] <taplar> k

[17:38:56] <sioux_> thanks alot =)
[17:39:05] <taplar> ;)
[18:08:55] <grapheti> Weird. When you build small testable code it's much easier.
[18:10:54] <taplar> that's the drean
[18:10:58] <taplar> *dream
[18:14:02] <grapheti> You mean that programmatic programming book was right? I've been writing software wrong this whole time!
[18:14:07] <grapheti> I want my years back!
[18:14:16] <grapheti> pragmatic*
[18:14:51] <taplar> I mean, it's all relative.  Writing testable code can also be a pain in the azz.
[18:15:34] <grapheti> tru
[18:16:00] <grapheti> dependency injection bb
