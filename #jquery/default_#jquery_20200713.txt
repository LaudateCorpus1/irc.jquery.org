[07:16:44] <manornk> Hi, I want to upload video using jquery, and then display frames bellow and trim it. Any suggestion of a plugin, or a way to build this
[12:00:59] <celina> Hello! I am trying to implement JQuery UI sortable into my project but i cannot access the download. It shows a page with Error 502 saying download.jqueryui.com "host error" and I was wondering if anybody knows what I can do now?
[12:31:57] <fanhako> hi, how do I set up default option for a plugin ? For example, I don't want to do this every time $table.DataTable({language:{url:myUrl}}), I just want $table.DataTable()
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> celina try https://jqueryui.com/download/all/ :)
[13:04:03] <robertmaxrees> fanhako you can't - but you could save that object to a var and use that instead.
[13:04:35] <robertmaxrees> so var myOptions = {language:{url:myUrl}}); then $table.DataTable(myOptions);
[13:06:14] <celina> robertmaxrees thank you so much! have a good day :)
[13:06:21] <robertmaxrees> you too!
[18:33:07] <weijunli> weijunli> hello, please scroll back/find Text `Vission`. I want to reduce the size of that section wrapper <section class=´ftco-mission´> without breaking the desing. My goal is to make the things smaller
[18:33:07] <weijunli> <weijunli> https://colorlib.com/preview/theme/aspiration/about.html
[18:33:07] <weijunli> <weijunli> I am trying directly on devtools but without success
[18:34:01] <robertmaxrees> weijunli what are you trying?
[18:34:20] <robertmaxrees> weijunli what do you mean "without breaking the design"?
[18:34:40] <weijunli> robertmaxrees, keeping it responsive
[18:35:01] <weijunli> robertmaxrees, tried stuff like max-height
[18:35:06] <robertmaxrees> weijunli it technically IS responsive right now, so you need to be more specific.
[18:35:24] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want #css instead :)
[18:35:25] <weijunli> robertmaxrees, all I need is to make the whole section with a smaller height
