[00:32:47] <ph88> does anyone know some good reading on how to keep client side and server side state in sync ?
[00:34:23] <granden> .change() If I use it in combination with the range-sliders in jquery ui. Will it change it times i move the "dot" on the slider or when I have dropped/released it?
[00:34:48] <Whiskey> What is esyest way to how can i explain this?
[00:35:25] <Whiskey> to get total px that a user has on the monitor, i mean i have 27inch and some maybe have 20inch so them can´t not see that mutch as i can
[00:36:27] <granden> It depends on the resolution? I guess you could have a monitior with the same resolution even if it is 27inch or 20inch. THen they would have the same amount of pixels just different density/size.
[00:37:12] <Whiskey> yeh but how do i find that out
[00:38:51] <Hooloovoo> Whiskey: What you got is basically $(window).width()
[00:39:03] <Hooloovoo> Which gives you the width of the browser window in pixels.
[00:39:10] <granden> Whiskey: You would not need jquery for it, screen.width and screen.height is fine
[00:39:18] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:39:30] <Whiskey> think about set max size on my elements on the page
[00:39:33] <granden> That would give you the users native screen resolution .
[00:39:44] <granden> Ok, then dont use screen.height/width :)
[00:40:13] <Whiskey> its only has to work if the browser is fully open and not resized or something
[00:40:16] <cambazz> how can i require a field during form validation conditionally?
[00:40:23] <cambazz> like if one field is input
[00:40:36] <cambazz> it should require the other one as well to be input
[01:07:37] <IamTrying> http://www.browser-update.org/ - is there any jQuery small plugin. Which tells all IE, Firefix, Opera, Safari, Midori browser users to use Google chrome and gives download option too ?
[01:08:27] <IamTrying> My users are all IE users and Safari from Mac. I want them to get Google chrome only else no service provided.
[01:09:37] <moijk> What is wrong with safari?
[01:10:43] <IamTrying> moijk, no WebRTC
[01:10:57] <IamTrying> and do not want to waste our team time on those users.
[01:11:53] <Cork> IamTrying: uh firefox has webrtc
[01:11:59] <bananashapedmood> anyone got an idea why when i form.serialize() my form -- all the input values work fine - but no matter what i type in the textarea - it will  not have a value/it is blank? it wont post either
[01:12:12] <Cork> and mono culturing the browser is really a bad choice
[01:12:32] <IamTrying> Cork, yes but has bugs for TCP still and Google chrome has all fixed regular so want to route all users to Google Chrome only.
[01:13:07] <IamTrying> any users coming without Google Chrome i want to prompt  a JNLP download of Google Chrome
[01:13:13] <Cork> IamTrying: you really should think that over
[01:13:40] <Cork> it is actions like that that gave us ie6...
[01:13:41] <moijk> Just test on features, because eventually it'll get support and then it is bad to redirect.
[01:14:52] <IamTrying> Its nightmare to pickup calls in mid-night saying "your application do not work" , just because users are using IE, Safari, Firefox. Problem gets solved just if they use Google chrome Cork , moijk
[01:15:16] <Cork> IamTrying: so then sniff for it and inform them in the page
[01:15:23] <Whiskey> Whats wrong here
[01:15:24] <Whiskey> $(body).css({"max-width": $(window).width() - 20})
[01:15:45] <Cork> Whiskey: $('body')
[01:15:53] <Cork> or $(document.body)
[01:16:29] <Whiskey> yeh ofc its not a variable
[01:16:53] <Whiskey> did not work good do :/
[01:18:20] <Whiskey> something overwrite body width, anyway possible to set max width that not can be overwritten of something else?
[01:19:00] <Cork> not in style
[01:19:07] <Gorroth> Hello, everyone
[01:19:10] <Cork> css rules can use !important
[01:20:34] <Gorroth> Do any of you know how to add some sort of draggable "frame separator" that can be placed inside a dialog?  Basically, I want to have a text area in the top half of a dialog and a text area in the bottom half as well.  Between them, I want some sort of draggable horizontal bar I can slide up and down to change the sizes of the top/bottom halves.
[01:20:39] <Whiskey> how do you applay that in $("body").css({"max-width": $(window).width() - 20} !important
[01:20:59] <Cork> Whiskey: you can't
[01:21:00] <Whiskey> i did try to "" set around it but did not work ether
[01:21:11] <Whiskey> so you have to set it direct in cSS
[01:21:21] <Cork> Whiskey: .css modifies the style on the individual dom elements
[01:21:30] <Cork> and those doesn't support important
[01:22:34] <Cork> Whiskey: you would have to create a document.styleSheets rule
[01:22:35] <Whiskey> ok so i have to make a ID or Class thats wrapped around the whole page, and then applay it to that one
[01:22:57] <Whiskey> if i understand you correct
[01:23:11] <Cork> ?mdn document.styleSheets
[01:23:13] <b-ot> Cork: document.styleSheets - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.styleSheets
[01:24:04] <Whiskey> Cork you lost me i don´t get it lets try see if this works
[01:25:56] <Whiskey> yeh that slow the problem
[01:28:32] <Whiskey> Cork: something i don´t understand is if i set it in CSS it works, but if i let JS set it it won´t work
[01:28:55] <Cork> Whiskey: if you create css rules through js it would work
[01:29:03] <Cork> but .css is NOT css rules
[01:29:26] <Cork> it is just a helper to modify the style property of the dom element
[01:29:53] <Whiskey> can i set the rules in css and then let js modify it?
[01:30:04] <Cork> well js can override it
[01:30:13] <Cork> though the style property on the dom element
[01:30:26] <Whiskey> you talk about the document.styleSheets?
[01:30:28] <Cork> or you can modify the rule through the object i showed you
[01:30:34] <Cork> well no
[01:30:47] <Cork> but document.styleSheets is the actual rules
[01:31:05] <Cork> so yes that can create the same thing you do in stylesheets statically
[01:31:36] <Cork> though warning you don't want to modify the styleShreets rule list a lot, cause it is slow (it updates the entire page)
[01:32:03] <Cork> and by a lot i mean, many times
[01:32:14] <Whiskey> but its the only wawy
[01:32:20] <Cork> but one time when the page loads or something like that should do
[01:32:26] <Whiskey> what i do is that i see how many PX a user can use, and only way to do that is in JS
[01:32:27] <Cork> Whiskey: btw what are you trying to do?
[01:33:49] <Whiskey> $("body").css({"max-width": $(window).width() - 20}) <-- as it says i try to not let the page be bigger then the screen can show
[01:34:11] <Cork> uh, why not just do max-width: 100%; ?
[01:34:15] <Cork> no need for js there
[01:34:58] <Whiskey> hmm can you do tthat
[01:35:21] <Garbee> 80% is the output of that calculation Whiskey...
[01:35:38] <Garbee> Window.width() -20
[01:35:45] <Cork> uh no
[01:36:01] <Garbee> Or is that working in pixels?
[01:36:06] <Cork> ya
[01:36:22] <Cork> also 100% takes the scrollbar into account
[01:36:28] <Garbee> Oh. Nvm then. Stupid morning moment.
[01:36:42] <Whiskey> Cork i don´t think that will work in my code but lets try it
[01:36:42] <Cork> and a sidenote calc(100% - 20px) could do it if you needed it
[01:36:55] <Cork> ?mdn css calc
[01:36:57] <b-ot> Cork: calc - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc
[01:38:19] <Whiskey> nope
[01:38:30] <Cork> why wouldn't it work?
[01:38:48] <Cork> you might want to set the same thing on html
[01:38:56] <Whiskey> no clue it did not work as the other way did
[01:39:02] <Cork> you have a link?
[01:39:32] <Whiskey> naaa but the body is a table thats why :)
[01:39:43] <Whiskey> the table don´t have any limited size, thats why its need px :D
[01:39:44] <Cork> is a table?!?
[01:39:48] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:39:55] <Whiskey> body {display: table}
[01:40:00] <Cork> ugg...
[01:40:04] <Cork> you kinda asked for it then
[01:40:36] <Whiskey> i have that to let all the other elements fallow the size automatic its quite nice
[01:40:47] <Whiskey> untill you get to big element :)
[01:41:09] <Cork> well a better option would prob be to leave the body as is
[01:41:13] <Cork> as it is a special element
[01:41:24] <Cork> and have an extra element inside it for the table rule
[01:42:33] <Whiskey> yeh i did that now but its still need to be set somehow
[01:43:06] <Cork> well if you have a max-width on the element with the display:table is should work
[01:43:19] <Cork> as long as you don't have any margins or similar around it
[01:43:49] <Cork> what it sounds like your trying to do should be doable quite easily in pure css
[01:44:18] <Whiskey> the problem is that the thing inside that one is like 3000px
[01:44:20] <Cork> but ya, if you could provide a link or a fiddle it would be easier to give you a solution
[01:44:33] <Cork> max-width on the table should still win
[01:44:45] <Cork> though the element inside might escape its parent though
[01:44:47] <Whiskey> yeh it does but not in %
[01:45:00] <Whiskey> its need px
[01:45:14] <Cork> if you set max-width: 100%; on body html and the table element
[01:45:17] <Cork> it should work
[01:45:42] <Whiskey> ok i don´t feel like doing this i try make fiddle
[01:49:13] <granden> Have a bit of headache after having some problem with this site, http://sponsorplaza.se/list3.php if You mave the first slider it should alert "Test" if you look at the sourcecode on line 478. But Nothing happens. And I dont get any JS-errors.
[01:51:55] <OnkelTem> Hi all. What does the construction mean: $().bind('mousemove.celledit', ...)? I mean ".celledit" suffix
[01:52:57] <OnkelTem> a kind of namespacing?
[01:53:30] <Cork> granden: well nothing is set to happen except the update of a few values
[01:53:51] <Cork> granden: you need to call the filter function or something if you want it to happen as you slide
[01:54:57] <granden> I only want it to happen after the user have dropped the slider
[01:55:24] <granden> not during. Because I'm going to do a ajax refresh of the page. And it would be alot of ajax calls if it would be during the slide
[01:55:31] <Cork> so do it in the change event
[01:56:38] <granden> Cork: Ok, thanks.
[02:00:10] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/b3UwB/1/ my fiddle
[02:01:55] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/b3UwB/2/ Cork <--- px set in .Test rule works fine
[02:02:05] * Cork looking
[02:03:55] <Whiskey> while % mess it up :D
[02:04:39] <HBSorensen> Hi, I have an issue with the spinner widget : The up arrow is missing when another input is used inside a different div than the first one. Any ideas?
[02:05:09] <Cork> Whiskey: hmm i don't see the difference actually
[02:05:21] <Cork> is the missing image the cause?
[02:05:32] <Cork> anyway i gtg soon
[02:06:41] <Whiskey> ooo
[02:06:48] <Whiskey> you have to change image to text
[02:07:10] <Whiskey> Switch View: Text, click on text :)
[02:07:26] <Cork> and im off
[02:07:36] <Whiskey> ;/ its still there :)
[02:07:47] <Anticom> Off to where Cork?
[02:07:50] <Anticom> morning ^.^
[02:11:49] <Whiskey> is it not CSS problems is it js problems is it not js problems is it something else :)
[02:15:30] <beepbeep_> having some inArray problems, can anyone explain this? http://jsfiddle.net/XaTXd/
[02:17:13] <melling> beepbeep, params are value then array, not array then value
[02:17:17] <melling> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.inarray/
[02:17:46] <beepbeep_> well fml.
[02:17:54] <melling> lmao
[02:18:02] <beepbeep_> I can't explain this
[02:18:06] <beepbeep_> like, this actually worked
[02:18:08] <beepbeep_> in production
[02:18:25] <beepbeep_> except when user searched for values with "&" in it.
[02:18:34] <beepbeep_> :S
[02:19:05] <melling> haha, i hate those bugs where afterwards it fforces you to reconsider every line of code you've ever written
[02:47:54] <rightnow> Sometimes i have var url = "http://mypage.com" and sometimes url = "http://mypage.com/?page=1"   anyone have any idea how i can do this:  addToUrl(url, { setting: 'bla' })  and have  http://mypage.com/?setting=bla   and http://mypage.com/?page=1&setting=bla
[03:46:22] <moldy> hi
[03:46:37] <moldy> how do i replace the inner html of an element with the element being clicked on?
[03:59:13] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to set the "left" value of an element to another element, but missing on something I guess ? http://jsfiddle.net/6cf2z/
[04:07:31] <monk3y> paulvd: still around?
[04:09:36] <monk3y> paulvd: when you retrieve the 'left' value from #a, it already has 'px' appended. You just need to remove the redundant '+ "px"' appendage when you set #b's left.  (hence; $("#b").css("left", $a);)  Console.log is your friend.
[04:10:20] <paulvd> cool thanks
[04:40:15] <chachan> hey guys, is .load() an async call?
[04:40:47] <chachan> or does it wait until for the server side response to continue?
[04:40:59] <chachan> -until-
[04:45:11] <chachan> anyway, I'm using now the complete callback to do what I wanted :)
[04:54:13] <ankurk> just asking you all can see my messages right?
[04:56:37] <yuka> ankurk ye
[04:58:33] <shoky> chachan yes it's async
[04:58:45] <chachan> shoky, thanks :)
[05:06:23] <CryCry> how to use the handlebars compatible with ajax?
[05:06:32] <CryCry> Русские есть?

[05:21:41] <ankurk> yuka thanks! :)
[05:37:29] <dantxo> What can I do to get rid of this warning? event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[05:38:07] <dantxo> I read that v1.11 solves it but I'm using it and I still get the warning
[05:38:35] <dantxo> and I would like it to go away
[05:49:45] <dantxo> no one? really?
[05:52:31] <ravenzz>  dantxo why bother?
[05:54:30] <Hooloovoo> dantxo: Well you could probably hack the jQuery version you have to not use that function. But why do that when it'll go away in the next version?
[05:55:03] <guy> Has anyone used http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider/ ? worth the money?
[05:59:14] <ankurk> is it possible to check the lengths of all input fields at once?
[05:59:25] <ankurk> and show some sort of length zero error?
[06:20:24] <shoky> var totalLength = $('input').map(function(){return this.value.length}).get().reduce(function(a,b){return a+b});
[06:21:11] <ShawnRisk> I am using this code: $('iframe').load(function() { $(this).contents().find('.phm').css('height', '278' + 'px'); }); to change a dynamically loaded iframe but get this error in chrome: Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame from accessing facebook.com.  What a I doing wrong?
[06:21:57] <shoky> ShawnRisk: you can't touch the contents of an iframe from a different origin
[06:22:06] <shoky> can't access them
[06:22:20] <shoky> would be a horrible security hole
[06:22:40] <ShawnRisk> shoky: even after the code is loaded on my site?
[06:22:52] <shoky> what code is loaded on your site?
[06:22:59] <shoky> facebook's code?
[06:24:45] <ShawnRisk> shoky: the code that is inside the iframe
[06:24:58] <shoky> ShawnRisk: it's not loaded on your site, it's loaded in a user's browser
[06:25:24] <ShawnRisk> shoky: and there is no way to access that?
[06:25:29] <shoky> and just like the browser doesn't let you access a different tab's contents.. this is the same thing
[06:25:36] <shoky> no
[06:25:38] <ShawnRisk> okay
[06:25:50] <ShawnRisk> can I use Facebook API to render the code not in an iframe?
[06:26:01] <shoky> no idea
[06:26:32] <ShawnRisk> okay thanks
[06:40:04] <krastavac> can i put jquery object in js var like this? http://jsfiddle.net/eKFTW/
[06:40:18] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:41:13] <krastavac> can you tell whats wrong in that code, it should equals widths of th's and td's
[06:41:35] <BillCriswell> krastavac: I just think you're using the wrong selectors. tbody1 would look for <tbody1> </tbody1>
[06:42:06] <krastavac> that is on purpose
[06:42:21] <krastavac> <tbody style="font-size:12px; " id="tbody1"></tbody>
[06:42:41] <BillCriswell> You'd want #tbody1 to select that, just tbody1 would select a <tbody1> element.
[06:43:04] <krastavac> you are right forgot #
[06:44:16] <krastavac> TypeError: element.width is not a function
[06:44:34] <krastavac> var width1 = element.width();
[06:45:22] <BillCriswell> It's not a jQuery object, you'd need to do $(element).width()
[06:46:58] <krastavac> ok
[06:47:24] <krastavac> its js object? tds.each(function(index, element) {
[06:47:42] <krastavac> get width of element
[06:47:54] <krastavac> those td's dont have ids
[06:48:35] <BillCriswell> They don't need ids.
[06:48:45] <BillCriswell> Since td is an element.
[06:50:02] <krastavac> so I can cast js node into jquery with $(jsnode). ?
[06:50:27] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:50:30] <krastavac> ok
[07:23:29] <effortDee> stupid Q
[07:26:08] <jsc802> does anyone have the useragent addon in firefox so they can view a site as an iphone
[07:26:30] <effortDee> jsc802 nope but
[07:26:39] <effortDee> try this https://app.io/safari
[07:27:23] <jsc802> i have a specific question about why a simple selector in something im working on isnt working i was hoping someone could look at but you need that addon in order to see the site
[07:27:26] <jsc802> ill put it in a pastebin
[07:28:13] <BillCriswell> jsc802: Are you detecting iPhone and applying css based on that?
[07:31:05] <jsc802> here is the problem:
[07:31:06] <jsc802> http://pastebin.com/pJmrEZR5
[07:33:16] <Cyttorak> hi
[07:34:10] <BillCriswell> What the fuck is the deal with auto play ads
[07:35:04] <BillCriswell> I will no longer visit pastebin.
[07:35:17] <Cyttorak> is there any known bug with jquery selectors selecting by name and some mobile browsers?
[07:35:22] <sunbeam> Hi, i am embedding videos to my site, youtube and vimeo, however before each video is played I would like to show my own ads
[07:35:27] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[07:35:29] <BillCriswell> Cyttorak: Not that I'm aware of.
[07:35:38] <fabioportieri> jsc802: you're not using .on delegate form
[07:35:54] <Cyttorak> thanks BillCriswell
[07:36:26] <Cyttorak> i have the follwing selector: $('input[name=billCode]:checked').val()
[07:36:34] <logikos> I want to replace the contents of an existing container with markup that i get back from an ajax call, i'm currently useing .html(stringfromserver) to do this and it works fine unless there are strings not contained within html tags .. such as stringfromserver="test node here<div>some other crap here</div>more text node" then only the <div> and its contents are placed into the container
[07:36:48] <BillCriswell> jsc802: Yes. Whats fabioportieri said. $(document).on('click', 'a.hlink', function(){ ... }); should work for any new link added.
[07:36:57] <logikos> apart from wraping the string in additional markup, what is the best way to achive my goal?
[07:37:04] <Cyttorak> i saw examples with :input: name="billCode" etc, what's the "correct" way?
[07:37:33] <logikos> most of the time the string is all wraped in markup, however sometimes i just var_dump($something) or die('something')
[07:37:36] <BillCriswell> Cyttorak: input would just get input elements, :input would get like selects and textareas and shit too. Your code should work.
[07:38:02] <Cyttorak> it works, but I am suspecting some older mobile browsers fail somehow with that selector
[07:38:03] <effortDee> im using this on a checkbox to then show a password form if they have an account http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/ why wont it work locally??
[07:38:13] <BillCriswell> Cyttorak: Why?
[07:38:27] <Cyttorak> well it is a more elaborated history
[07:38:48] <Cyttorak> i use that selector in order to fill a parameter for an ajax call
[07:38:56] <Cyttorak> it workd perfectly
[07:39:04] <Cyttorak> but some reports from production server
[07:39:16] <Cyttorak> indicates that parameter sometimes gets "undefined" value
[07:39:22] <BillCriswell> effortDee: Are you trying to get the JS locally?
[07:39:33] <jsc802> thank you
[07:39:37] <BillCriswell> Look at the "Network" tab in the dev tools and see if anything is red.
[07:39:53] <Cyttorak> and I am be able to reproduce it makin selector to fail, so I am thinking it is some type of error with old browsers of old mobile devices
[07:40:14] <effortDee> BillCriswell
[07:40:17] <effortDee> yes on my local machine
[07:40:24] <effortDee> i've linked to jquery, i have it downloaded
[07:40:53] <Cyttorak> effortDee: chorme does not allow you to load js files and other resources locally
[07:40:58] <Cyttorak> chrome*
[07:41:01] <BillCriswell> effortDee: Are you using a local server or do you have like file:// in your url?
[07:41:16] <effortDee> i've tried loading it from <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"> too
[07:41:22] <effortDee> file://
[07:41:49] <logikos> please, anyone know how i might replace the contents of a container with a string containing html .html(string) will work but stips out text nodes not wraped in markup
[07:41:50] <effortDee> i know im being stupid here :o
[07:42:00] <BillCriswell> effortDee: Anything in the "Network" pane of the devools red?
[07:42:16] <BillCriswell> dev tools.
[07:42:52] <effortDee> failed to load resource
[07:42:57] <BillCriswell> logikos: .text(string) ?
[07:43:00] <effortDee> which im guessing is the link toe the jquery
[07:43:13] <BillCriswell> effortDee: Sounds like a safe bet.
[07:43:17] <effortDee> weird
[07:43:21] <effortDee> so what should i be linking too
[07:43:32] <effortDee> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js">
[07:43:34] <effortDee> $('#isAgeSelected').click(function() {
[07:43:36] <effortDee> $("#txtAge").toggle(this.checked);
[07:43:38] <effortDee> });
[07:43:40] <effortDee> </script>
[07:43:40] <effortDee> shit sorry
[07:43:47] <effortDee> thats in my <head>?
[07:44:28] <BillCriswell> effortDee: You need to start a new script tag.
[07:44:36] <effortDee> do i?
[07:44:41] <effortDee> with the script inside?
[07:44:44] <BillCriswell> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script> <script> .... </script>
[07:45:01] <effortDee> rgr
[07:45:07] <logikos> BillCriswell: that seems to htmlentities() the string ... so it prints < as &lt;
[07:45:20] <effortDee> no red now :D
[07:45:23] <effortDee> in network
[07:45:59] <BillCriswell> effortDee: If your script is in the head you'll also need to wrap it in a document ready.
[07:46:01] <Cyttorak> it seems even IE7 is able to work properly with that selector, damn...
[07:46:19] <effortDee> ah because
[07:46:20] <effortDee> i know
[07:46:22] <effortDee> ty!
[07:46:24] <BillCriswell> so $(function(){  /* Your Code */ }); since it can't do anything till the document is ready.
[07:46:28] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:46:53] <BillCriswell> $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); is easier to read and does the same thing... not as short, but easier to grok.
[07:47:18] <effortDee> yep got that
[07:47:20] <effortDee> its because its in head
[07:47:28] <effortDee> thanks for reminding me
[07:47:31] <effortDee> all working correctly now
[07:47:35] <effortDee> thankyou so much BillCriswell
[07:47:48] <effortDee> keep on rocking dude! or folking or rapping or whatever your music taste may be
[07:48:01] <effortDee> mucho gracias
[07:48:06] <effortDee> kind sir
[07:49:12] <Cyttorak> muchas* gracias
[07:49:14] <Cyttorak> XD
[07:50:01] <effortDee> thankyou
[07:50:04] <effortDee> i was just in tenerife as well
[07:50:05] <effortDee> :(
[07:50:24] <effortDee> i speak 0 spanish but a bit of french so was weird
[07:52:02] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:53:02] <Cyttorak> hehehe
[08:00:09] * Webmetz headdesks. I put a coda slider on a page, and now it interfered with a jquery dropdown menu...and I have no idea where http://powers.webmetz.com/we-build-revenue/
[08:13:54] <sunbeam> Hi, i am embedding videos to my site, youtube and vimeo, however before each video is played I would like to show my own ads
[08:13:57] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[08:14:28] <snover> pretty sure that is against the terms of use of those services.
[08:16:44] <sunbeam> why?
[08:17:27] <snover> why what
[08:17:42] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: setTimeout().
[08:18:11] <BillCriswell> setTimeout(function(){ /* Play Video */ }, lenghtOfYourAdsInMicroseconds );
[08:18:25] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: any example of this you know?
[08:18:32] <sunbeam> I also need to play it halfway the youtube video and pause it
[08:19:05] <decx> read up on youtube api and vimeo api
[08:19:20] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Exactly what decx suggests.
[08:19:22] <decx> not extactly jquery specific
[08:19:27] <decx> exactly
[08:20:20] <sunbeam> the displaying should use jquery
[08:20:39] <decx> believe me, that will be the least of your worries
[08:21:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah, delay playing the video for the length of your first ad, then when the current time of the video is half the total time you pause the video for the length of the second ad.
[08:21:51] <decx> i'd have a callback on the ad and set up the embeds there
[08:21:53] <BillCriswell> It's really just pausing the video at certain times for certain amounts of time.
[08:22:13] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: ok thanks got it
[08:22:20] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: so this is possible for vimeo and youtube?
[08:22:47] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I'm not familiar enough with their APIS to know for certain.
[08:23:28] <decx> it's pretty straight forward if you choose one, but supporting both in one system is a bigger hassle
[08:23:58] <decx> unless you use something like embed.ly
[08:24:08] <snover> BillCriswell: it would be great if you didn’t help people violate terms of service 👎
[08:24:41] <snover> vimeo use is contingent upon non-commercial use
[08:25:23] <Webmetz> Hmmm....host the video yourself and splice the ads in?
[08:25:36] <snover> that would be copyright infringement
[08:25:40] <ankurk> I am getting this error on line 4 & 5, Cannot call method 'toLowerCase' of undefined in this function http://pastebin.com/v8EvgUd0
[08:25:45] <ankurk> any idea why?
[08:25:50] <BillCriswell> snover: Then he shouldn't build it. =)
[08:26:06] <snover> BillCriswell: i’m aware, which is why i gave the thumbs-down
[08:26:40] <decx> yeah there's plenty of video hosters that have a better monetization than youtube if you produce original content
[08:26:44] <BillCriswell> ankurk: Where is toLowerCase() being used?
[08:27:10] <snover> decx: i’m going to go out on a limb and say that sunbeam is not trying to monetise their own content…
[08:27:26] <ankurk> It's not used anywhere
[08:27:32] <decx> i dont want to assume but yeah seems like it
[08:27:55] <sunbeam> snover: thanks
[08:27:58] <sunbeam> Webmetz: not possible for me
[08:28:10] <BillCriswell> ankurk: Ah, you're using .each wrong.
[08:28:44] <decx> according to duch, any use of each is wrong ;)
[08:28:57] <BillCriswell> $('input[type="hidden"]').each(function(i,value){ ... }); is what you probably want.. also value is a weird name for that variable, shoudl be "input" or something.
[08:29:03] <jkoudys> lol
[08:29:40] <sunbeam> snover: if you are sure this is not allowed i wont do it
[08:31:39] <ankurk> BillCriswell: I did this now, http://pastebin.com/SJQqWaDh
[08:31:49] <ankurk> but it's not console logging 'ac'
[08:32:37] <BillCriswell> do console.log( hidden_value, title, hidden_value === title ) inside the each and make sure they're what you think they are.
[08:33:54] <ankurk> I think I solved the issue :)
[08:33:59] <ankurk> thanks man!
[08:34:03] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:38:28] <decx> good lord the the wordpress 3.8 admin is hideous
[08:38:33] <decx> oh, sorry wrong network
[08:39:50] <jonez> I need a nudge in the right direction. is there a reliable way to detect javascript without doing something async?
[08:40:19] <yellowfish> 1what do you mean "detect" javascript?
[08:40:23] <decx> what do you mean? detect if a specific resource is loaded?
[08:41:36] <duch_kazatel> jonez you mean test if javascript is enabled?
[08:42:02] <decx> now we play the waiting game
[08:42:05] <jonez> ya. I'm making a form system that works with and without js
[08:42:17] <duch_kazatel> you wouldn't need to worry about it...
[08:42:21] <duch_kazatel> *shouldn't
[08:42:23] <jonez> sorry I switched away from the window :)
[08:42:42] <duch_kazatel> you have <noscript> tags.  that's about the best you're going to get.
[08:43:09] <BillCriswell> <noscript>You don't deserve the internet</noscript>
[08:43:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah basically.
[08:43:27] <snover> 1. use progressive enhancement. 2. nothing on the web works without javascript anyway so stop caring
[08:43:30] <duch_kazatel> you really don't need to worry about whether or not JS is enabled anymore IMO.
[08:44:10] <jonez> I have heard there are knockoff tablets without js
[08:44:15] <decx> i like a good fallback, blank pages where i have to go through 50 hosts in my noscript menu annoy me
[08:44:36] <snover> jonez: and where did you hear that
[08:44:41] <tandroid> Don't buy a knockoff tablet
[08:45:07] <jonez> snover, the internet
[08:45:16] <BillCriswell> jonez: I bet they're in the trash a week after they're bought haha.
[08:45:24] <duch_kazatel> jonez what is your form form?
[08:45:26] <duch_kazatel> *for
[08:45:32] <jonez> it's a general system
[08:45:39] <snover> jonez: gee, thanks…
[08:45:43] <jonez> actually, I am using html_quickform2
[08:45:44] <snover> that’s very specific.
[08:45:56] <duch_kazatel> "a general system" targeted at what audience?
[08:45:58] <snover> i also heard on the internet that there’s a zombie unicorn invasion
[08:46:01] <duch_kazatel> are people buying things from you?
[08:46:05] <duch_kazatel> a social network?
[08:46:11] <snover> better stock up on rainbow repellant
[08:46:13] <jonez> I am working on a website. in this case it is a "membership information request form"
[08:46:33] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* what does the website do?
[08:46:41] <jonez> if js is enabled, I use jquery to do some animation and to submit the form
[08:46:47] <ankurk> If I have a <img> tag in a <li> tag, how would I get the <li> tag?
[08:46:58] <decx> do you have analytics for your audience already? if so you can tell if it's worth your time to make a no-js version
[08:47:06] <duch_kazatel> (it won't be worth it)
[08:47:08] <BillCriswell> jonez: Then Javascript being enabled shouldn't matter.
[08:47:13] <snover> if you can’t request membership information without animations you really shouldn’t even bother
[08:47:38] <jonez> BillCriswell, I thought the same thing until I modified the form's template to handle form errors.. with js blocked, it just shows a box without much in it.
[08:47:41] <duch_kazatel> jonez if you want to do it the smart way, setup the form to work 100% without javascript, then use JS to capture your submit, etc...
[08:47:52] <jonez> duch_kazatel, that is what I have done
[08:48:36] <duch_kazatel> then there shouldn't be an issue.
[08:48:44] <jonez> the trouble is that if js is blocked, I do not want to display the "form errors" div unless there are actually errors
[08:48:59] <duch_kazatel> then set the css for that div to display: none;
[08:49:06] <duch_kazatel> and set your JS to show/hide it.
[08:49:19] <duch_kazatel> and either way, there's no reason to accommodate the fraction of users who aren't using javascript at this point imo.
[08:50:13] <WebBirthday> Sooo...any idea what about the coda jquery slider can stop the menu in http://powers.webmetz.com/we-build-revenue/  but not any other page?
[08:50:41] <jonez> duch_kazatel, when I originally wrote the site it did not use any js. now I'm enhancing a bit.
[08:50:41] <jonez> I'll think more about it.
[08:50:56] <duch_kazatel> i really wouldn't worry about it.
[08:51:15] <duch_kazatel> WebBirthday only include the code on that page?
[08:51:24] <duch_kazatel> WebBirthday or only enable it if the URL matches certain criteria?
[08:51:37] <jedimind> http://commitlogsfromlastnight.com/
[08:52:29] <BillCriswell> "fuck you gandi"
[08:53:22] <WebBirthday> duch_kazatel, I already have it working like that
[08:53:47] <duch_kazatel> jonez i think it's important to consider how much you'll make off of folks without JS.  you might end up actually losing money spending time on supporting them.
[08:53:51] <duch_kazatel> WebBirthday sorry, then what's the issue?
[08:54:11] <h4k1m> hello guys
[08:54:28] <h4k1m> anyone knows a good plugin to show a message when a task is completed
[08:54:43] <h4k1m> (a form has been submitted for example)
[08:54:48] <WebBirthday> the problem is, whenever the slider jquery is active, the drop down menu is not
[08:54:59] <duch_kazatel> h4k1m you mean a modal?
[08:55:05] <h4k1m> right
[08:55:13] <h4k1m> but a light modal
[08:55:18] <jedimind> BillCriswell these are cracking me up so much
[08:55:33] <h4k1m> some qtip stuff but not really a tip
[08:55:40] <duch_kazatel> "a light modal" - huh?
[08:55:46] <duch_kazatel> you want a tooltip or a modal?
[08:55:54] <h4k1m> a tooltip
[08:55:59] <duch_kazatel> try powertip
[08:56:02] <h4k1m> that's the world I would use
[08:56:17] <h4k1m> ok thanks duch_kazatel
[08:56:45] <BillCriswell> I guess it just scams commits for profanity?
[08:57:30] <SamuraiDio> Hi,
[08:57:39] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ever see the video where they set up the computer to take a picture of the user ever time they commit?
[08:57:43] <SamuraiDio> How does jQuery implements method overload?
[08:57:50] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell no and that's genius.
[08:58:16] <BillCriswell> I think I saw it in a video Paul Irish was in... forget what the subject matter was though.
[08:58:17] <duch_kazatel> SamuraiDio probably through accessing the function args via their array-like object, though I've never looked myself.
[08:58:29] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel what I really  want is a popup that shows at the top of the page to say that the form has been submitted successfully
[08:58:36] <anli_> Can I have a click ignored and passed to the element below instead?
[08:59:04] <jedimind> anli_ yes and no
[08:59:04] <duch_kazatel> "passed to the element below instead"?
[08:59:16] <WebBirthday> Ah, it is something that has to do with http://powers.webmetz.com/wp-content/themes/Powers/js/jquery-1.2.6.min.js  ...whenever that is implemented the menu stops working...
[08:59:16] <BillCriswell> http://mroth.github.io/lolcommits/
[08:59:20] <anli_> As if the div receving the click did not exist
[08:59:35] <duch_kazatel> anli_ yes.
[08:59:57] <duch_kazatel> anli_ sure can - $('selector').on('click', function(e){e.preventDefault(); $('otherThing').click();});
[09:00:06] <duch_kazatel> not sure if that's really what you want though.
[09:00:22] <anli_> I already got an answer in another channel :)
[09:00:22] <duch_kazatel> h4k1m why not just make that yourself?
[09:00:24] <anli_> thanks however
[09:00:35] <anli_> http://caniuse.com/pointer-events
[09:00:38] <duch_kazatel> why do people waste multiple folks' time doing that?
[09:01:00] <duch_kazatel> "JUST GONNA SHOTGUN OUT TO A FEW CHANNELS MAKE IT A RACE"
[09:01:05] <jedimind> duch_kazatel he didnt
[09:01:11] <anli_> Oh, but its not really an active channel, its #css
[09:01:13] <jedimind> duch_kazatel i answered him in #css because he asked other questions not related to this in that channel
[09:01:19] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[09:01:22] <duch_kazatel> still bothers me.
[09:01:24] <jedimind> duch_kazatel *hugs*
[09:01:31] <BillCriswell> You're all jerks.
[09:01:33] <jedimind> there's nothing wrong with covering his bases
[09:01:43] <anli_> I found it useful, I was really pleased
[09:01:45] <duch_kazatel> eh, ask in one place before going elsehwere imo.
[09:01:53] <jedimind> for example, i gave him a css solution, and you gave him a js one to cover his bases
[09:01:53] <duch_kazatel> but whatevs.
[09:01:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: How long before you can ask elsewhere?
[09:01:59] <jedimind> since the css one doesnt apply to >IE10
[09:02:01] <jedimind> err <
[09:02:08] <anli_> This discussion about wasting peoples time is a real waste :)
[09:02:12] <jedimind> ++
[09:02:22] <duch_kazatel> eh, I usually wait until I'm fairly certain the given room can't help.
[09:02:39] <jedimind> duch_kazatel generally, i agree with your sentiment
[09:02:39] <duch_kazatel> then again i'm rarely asking questions these days SO MAYBE I'M JUST A JADED ASSHOLE
[09:02:42] <duch_kazatel> >:(
[09:02:42] <BillCriswell> anli_: Get back up on the stand!
[09:02:46] <jedimind> im just saying, in this case, its a bit of the exception
[09:02:48] <BillCriswell> Heresay.
[09:02:54] <duch_kazatel> heresy
[09:03:00] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/4Kw1Pbc.jpg aww
[09:03:01] <jedimind> hearse-y
[09:03:02] <duch_kazatel> it's nbd honestly.
[09:03:06] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel I should have searched for a notification plugin :/
[09:03:24] <duch_kazatel> h4k1m kay.  i would've built it out myself prolly.
[09:03:31] <anli_> BillCriswell: Aaaw :)
[09:04:07] <BillCriswell> Lunch.
[09:04:09] <h4k1m> duch_kazatel, I dont have time now
[09:04:17] <h4k1m> will have to ask google
[09:04:21] <duch_kazatel> h4k1m lol it's a div that you show/hide.
[09:04:24] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[09:05:01] <h4k1m> you re right
[09:05:14] <jedimind> BillCriswell where you going? can i come ?
[09:05:25] <duch_kazatel> ugh it's only 9:05 here D:
[09:05:33] <jedimind> no wonder you're grumpy! :)
[09:05:46] <jedimind> read some of these : http://commitlogsfromlastnight.com/
[09:06:16] <duch_kazatel> i saw that. been pokin' slowly today
[09:06:46] <dAnjou> hi, i have a question about development practices with jquery (since i'm more of a backend guy). how do i keep track of what function is triggered by what action? so for example i may have a couple of <a>, <button> and so on with IDs and there are "actions" associated with them like $('a#foobar').click(...)
[09:07:13] <grafi> weirdest shit oô
[09:07:17] <dAnjou> so how can i instantly know whether an <a> or a <button> has an action associated with it
[09:07:18] <duch_kazatel> dAnjou what do you mean "keep track"?
[09:07:25] <dAnjou> -^
[09:07:38] <duch_kazatel> dAnjou check out firebug/chrome's dev tools/ie11's dev tools./
[09:07:47] <duch_kazatel> any browser's dev tools, really.
[09:08:07] <dAnjou> i know those tools but what's the workflow?
[09:08:20] <duch_kazatel> select the element you want to look at and check?
[09:08:41] <WebBirthday> you know what, I am gonna try a different slider
[09:08:44] <WebBirthday> maybe that will work
[09:09:06] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind that sometimes the event isn't directly bound, but instead the script makes use of event delegation, so the binding happens higher up the document.
[09:10:10] <duch_kazatel> dAnjou are you trying to troubleshoot something?
[09:10:52] <duch_kazatel> or just looking for general info?
[09:11:31] <dAnjou> duch_kazatel: general info
[09:12:12] <dAnjou> i know that it might not be possible to determine this technically
[09:12:20] <dAnjou> like by code analysis
[09:12:24] <duch_kazatel> it will, just not as easily as you might be thinking.
[09:12:34] <dAnjou> i don't think anything ;)
[09:12:48] <duch_kazatel> learn how to use a given browser's developer tools.  learn how do use their debuggers and element inspectors.
[09:13:13] <dAnjou> i'm just looking for inspiration
[09:13:45] <BillCriswell> I went to Wawa.
[09:14:12] <dAnjou> but for example i have <a id="foo" ...> and $('a#foo') and $('#foo')
[09:14:26] <dAnjou> quite inconsistent but with multiple devs it can happen
[09:14:36] <duch_kazatel> sure.  and the first one should be shot.
[09:14:37] <dAnjou> how can i find these quickly?
[09:14:38] <duch_kazatel> but go on.
[09:14:45] <duch_kazatel> go into your codebase and search for #foo
[09:14:54] <dAnjou> hmm
[09:15:13] <duch_kazatel> or go into your inspector/debugger and poke through there.
[09:15:21] <dAnjou> not really convenient but i guess that's how it is then
[09:16:34] <duch_kazatel> that's why enforcing some simple standards is important - things like $('a#foo') vs $('#foo') shouldn't be happening.
[09:17:07] <duch_kazatel> the first one is completely unnecessary, and so shouldn't be there.  code review is a good way to catch this.
[09:17:21] <dAnjou> yeah, well. i would accept "naming scheme" as a good enough answer ;)
[09:17:48] <anli_> a#foo will under any circumstances be a link, cant that be a good thing to know?
[09:18:05] <duch_kazatel> anli_ you're making the selector engine do extra work unnecessarily.
[09:18:14] <duch_kazatel> you can only ever use an ID once on a page.
[09:18:17] <anli_> Well, I think it is fast so its not a problem
[09:18:29] <anli_> I will never use an id more than once
[09:18:31] <duch_kazatel> it's not as fast as just $('#foo')
[09:18:35] <dAnjou> duch_kazatel: on one page it's a link on another a button ;)
[09:18:42] <anli_> Is the difference noticeable by a user?
[09:18:49] <anli_> Not having an atomic clock
[09:19:02] <duch_kazatel> again, it's all about holding your codebase to a high enough standard.
[09:19:21] <anli_> I always try to get the highest standard, and optimizing on speed seldom gives me that
[09:19:21] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use inefficient selectors, go ahead, but if you aren't sure what an ID is for, perhaps you might consider renaming them.
[09:19:42] <duch_kazatel> if you're reusing IDs accross pages in an inconsistent way, you may have other problems to consider.
[09:20:06] <anli_> I never reuse id, I try to actually not use them in the first place, if possible
[09:20:28] <duch_kazatel> and that's smart.  but using $('a#foo') makes absolutely no sense to me.
[09:20:52] <anli_> Unless we must know foo has not been made a name of something else than a a-tag
[09:21:05] <anli_> But I agree its not really nice looking
[09:21:06] <duch_kazatel> that's when i refactor.
[09:21:14] <Velveeta> refactor ALL the things!
[09:21:15] <duch_kazatel> it's not that it isn't nice looking, it's totally unnecessary.
[09:21:20] <dAnjou> duch_kazatel: the current one does this: <a onclick="if ( $('button.save').hasClass('focus') ) { xxxxxx.client.showMenu('{% trans "Save Your Changes " %}', '<p>' + '{% trans "You should save your changes before proceeding!" %}' + '</p>', false, { '{% trans "Save" %}': function() { $('form').submit(); }, '{% trans "Discard" %}': function() { $(this).dialog('close'); window.location='{% url
[09:21:22] <dAnjou> interview.views.client.company_settings %}'; } }); $('button.save').removeClass('focus'); return false; }" href="{% url interview.views.client.company_settings %}"{% ifequal view_name 'company_settings' %} class="focus"{% endifequal %}><img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/transparent.gif" class="icon medium settings"/>{% trans 'Settings' %}</a>
[09:21:36] <duch_kazatel> dAnjou wait you have inline event handlers?
[09:21:39] <anli_> dAnjou: seriously?
[09:21:41] <duch_kazatel> that's a whole nother level of problems.
[09:21:41] * dAnjou provides eye bleach
[09:21:43] <duch_kazatel> that's your issue.
[09:21:58] * Velveeta thanks dAnjou for the bleach, and rinses thoroughly.
[09:22:12] <dAnjou> i was as shocked as you
[09:22:22] <anli_> lol
[09:22:40] <Velveeta> do you guys have a code review process in place?
[09:23:07] <duch_kazatel> that's precisely the kind of thing we reject here.
[09:23:09] <dAnjou> let's not talk about this kind of stuff ;)
[09:23:14] <duch_kazatel> unless you have a really amazing reason
[09:23:16] <anli_> heh
[09:23:20] <dAnjou> i'll get angry then
[09:23:26] <duch_kazatel> that's what i'd do tbh.
[09:23:29] <duch_kazatel> start stabbing bitches.
[09:23:33] <Velveeta> lol
[09:24:15] <dAnjou> anyway
[09:24:22] <dAnjou> duch_kazatel: thanks for your insight
[09:24:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah you're real SOL at that point.  if there's a blend of $('a#foo'), $('#foo'), and inline handlers, you're gonna have a bad time.
[09:25:04] <dAnjou> unlike the dev before me i'm actually interested in best practices
[09:25:05] <dAnjou> ;)
[09:26:03] <duch_kazatel> hah.  you'll get there.
[09:26:07] <duch_kazatel> it's a process.
[09:27:21] <dAnjou> not really trying though. i'm rather staying on the server side
[09:27:23] <dAnjou> :P
[09:27:49] <duch_kazatel> imo you should do as much server-side as you can.  don't use javascript until you need to.
[09:28:21] <snover> boy is that bad advice.
[09:28:23] <dAnjou> my motto already
[09:28:35] <duch_kazatel> why is that bad advice?
[09:29:00] <anli_> Its not either good or bad, it just do not make sense
[09:29:23] <duch_kazatel> lmao.
[09:29:31] <anli_> :)
[09:29:33] <snover> performance, perceived and actual, will always be better if you can do things on the local machine. reducing the amount of heavy work the server has to do means you have lower infrastructure cost.
[09:29:51] <duch_kazatel> we've found that to not necessarily be true here, snover.
[09:29:54] <duch_kazatel> there's a balance.
[09:30:00] <anli_> Come one, you will never perform calculations client side
[09:30:05] <tandroid> But what if I buy an off brand tablet and don't have js :)
[09:31:08] <duch_kazatel> it really depends on the stack.
[09:31:21] <Elirips> Hello. How can I check if a element inside the dom is of type 'input button' or of type 'input text/password' ?
[09:31:28] <tandroid> Servers are much more powerful than most local machines. It makes sense to do calculations on the server side in my opinion.
[09:31:30] <snover> it really doesn’t. you can’t defeat the speed of light.
[09:31:49] <anli_> foo.is(':text')
[09:32:03] <anli_> Or :password, I think
[09:32:06] <Elirips> anli_: thank you. just found 'ctrl.is('input:text')'
[09:32:07] <tandroid> snover: that makes no sense
[09:32:12] <duch_kazatel> $('input[type="buttom"]')
[09:32:13] <Elirips> wonderfull :)
[09:32:19] <duch_kazatel> i've seen the argument befor.e
[09:32:20] <anli_> lol
[09:32:22] <duch_kazatel> and it's really dependent.
[09:32:38] <anli_> $('input[type="cunt"]');
[09:32:44] <anli_> sorry
[09:32:59] <Elirips> :)
[09:33:20] <alxy> hello, I have a problem with this jquery/bootstrap setup. I looks like jquery doesnt do aanything for me: http://jsfiddle.net/e2SPU/
[09:33:22] <duch_kazatel> snover in our case, having the client chew through a bunch of JSON to turn that into markup was actually slower then transmitting markup.
[09:33:34] <alxy> it should at least echo these test alerts
[09:34:42] <duch_kazatel> i will concede that it can be faster to do things like you're suggesting, at a certain point that stops being true.
[09:35:16] <snover> duch_kazatel: and i suppose you were sending the minimum amount of data, properly using document fragments, and yielding back to the main UI thread periodically?
[09:35:24] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[09:35:32] <duch_kazatel> it's a lot of data.
[09:35:41] <snover> that’s the “minimum amount of data” part
[09:35:51] <duch_kazatel> it was as minimal as we could get.
[09:35:56] <duch_kazatel> we also have to support back to IE8.
[09:36:39] <snover> this is what kind of data? i’m going to guess grid or table?
[09:36:46] <duch_kazatel> search results in this case.
[09:37:12] <duch_kazatel> we're also running on a fairly... unusual stack.
[09:37:38] <snover> and you couldn’t transform and render 25–50 results quickly?
[09:38:11] <tandroid> alxy: you're using jsfiddle incorrectly. It already adds the html, head and body tags. all script should go in the js section and styles in the css section
[09:38:16] <duch_kazatel> not in our case.  our search page is used and abused.  we have to shoehorn its functionality to do lots of other things.
[09:38:31] <duch_kazatel> we're working on rehashing the solution entirely down the road.
[09:39:08] <alxy> tandroid, yes, I know, I was ust looking for a quick place to paste...
[09:39:32] <tandroid> alxy: pastebin is good for that.
[09:40:00] <dirthead> Is there a way to get the actual width of a horizontal set of radio buttons?
[09:40:34] <duch_kazatel> .width()?
[09:41:14] <dirthead> duch_kazatel: well, is doesn't return the true width of the buttons. It is something less than the true width.
[09:41:23] <alxy> tandroid wait Ill update it
[09:41:27] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "true width"?
[09:41:34] <alxy> but it doesnt work locally as well
[09:41:42] <duch_kazatel> do you mean including all padding/margins/borders?
[09:41:52] <dirthead> I think so...
[09:42:28] <dirthead> .width() seems to return something like the width of the text, which is less than the width of the buttons
[09:42:50] <alxy> http://pastebin.com/6wWqLaty
[09:42:55] <alxy> It doesnt do anything for me
[09:43:02] <alxy> doesnt log anything in console
[09:43:04] <alxy> no errors
[09:44:22] <duch_kazatel> dirthead have a code sample?
[09:44:32] <Whiskey> :)
[09:44:44] <dirthead> duch_kazatel: I could work one up.
[09:45:17] <tandroid> alxy: I'm looking at it now
[09:45:26] <alxy> tandroid, dont have to
[09:45:28] <alxy> just solved it
[09:45:33] <alxy> I dont know why
[09:45:39] <alxy> but if bootstrap is included
[09:45:45] <alxy> basic error messages dont show up
[09:45:56] <tandroid> alxy: oh I see
[09:45:57] <alxy> commented out and saw the syntax error immediatly
[09:46:04] <alxy> missing closing ready func ;)
[09:46:13] <tandroid> Ahh that will do it!
[09:46:27] <alxy> But I have no idea why the errors dont show up
[09:46:31] <alxy> not ice :(
[09:46:41] <alxy> but thanks any way :)
[09:48:02] <tandroid> no problem!
[09:49:10] <trewd6> how come this icon doesn't display on top of the input? http://jsfiddle.net/9Wp3E/
[09:50:18] <tandroid> trewd6: There is nothing in that jsbin
[09:50:26] <tandroid> *jsfiddle
[09:53:30] <Cork> yup yup... http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/14jan/uf005188.gif
[09:55:06] <trewd6> tandroid: http://jsfiddle.net/9Wp3E/1/
[09:56:20] <dirthead> duch_kazatel: Here is a code sample trying to use the height of horizontal radio buttons. It is a code snippet from a class, so you can't run it. http://jsbin.com/ibOZifaM/1/edit
[09:56:24] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha
[09:57:08] <duch_kazatel> dirthead without seeing the markup, it's hard to help.
[09:57:34] <dirthead> duch_kazatel: ah, well that's all generated from JS at runtime.
[09:57:57] <tandroid> trewd6: your image is way too big
[09:58:57] <tandroid> trewd6: but, this is how you would do it: http://jsfiddle.net/9Wp3E/2/
[09:59:03] <duch_kazatel> dirthead so you can't give me a functioning example?  .width() gives you the rendered width of a thing.  depending on what you're selecting the width of, etc, you'll get results you might not expect.
[09:59:46] <Cork> trewd6: http://jsfiddle.net/9Wp3E/3/
[09:59:56] <Cork> another option :)
[10:00:11] <Cork> ugg or the same option >_<
[10:00:11] <dirthead> maybe I'll try putting together a small example
[10:00:40] <tandroid> Cork: reinforcement of the same idea :)
[10:00:51] <Cork> trewd6: sidenote you can't have display: inline; on position: absolute;
[10:00:57] <Cork> it is impossible
[10:01:18] <tandroid> and background images will not work on inline.
[10:01:22] <Cork> position: absolute forces display: block;
[10:01:29] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaaaaay css 101
[10:01:46] <tandroid> in #jquery of all places
[10:02:02] <duch_kazatel> right?!  it's good stuff to know.
[10:02:11] <Cork> what i don't really get is why firefox doesn't render the image though...
[10:02:31] <tandroid> Not sure what you mean, Cork
[10:02:32] <duch_kazatel> what are we looking at?
[10:02:34] <tandroid> It does for me
[10:02:40] <trewd6> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/9Wp3E/4/
[10:02:42] <Cork> ugg
[10:02:44] <Cork> forget it
[10:02:51] <Cork> it's me blocking the domain >_>
[10:02:57] <Cork> forgot i do that in this browser
[10:03:08] <tandroid> Oh I see
[10:03:18] <tandroid> trewd6, add background-size: 100%
[10:03:25] <trewd6> tandroid: thank you, works
[10:03:38] <Cork> trevor: or background-position: 50% 50%;
[10:03:48] <Cork> right now you only see the transparent part of the image
[10:04:09] <Cork> as the element is 40x40 but the image is 512x512, round with transparent corners
[10:04:16] <WebBirthday> Good Reason: something.gov  site is broken, need help badly....                     < it happens, not to me, mind you, but I have heard it happening
[10:04:31] <WebBirthday> ooops, didn't see the chat log progress
[10:04:33] <WebBirthday> My bad
[10:04:35] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:04:37] <duch_kazatel> i am lost.
[10:04:48] <tandroid> Yeah what?
[10:04:48] <duch_kazatel> i need a beer.
[10:04:59] <WebBirthday> Was responding to the person asking for codereview
[10:05:14] <krambiorix> hi, i want to time how long a function takes to end... How can i do that?
[10:05:27] <Cork> console.time
[10:05:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I hear tht.
[10:05:51] <BillCriswell> and console.time('Started some shit'); .... console.timeEnd('finished some shit')
[10:06:03] <BillCriswell> Er wait, used that wrong.
[10:06:08] <Cork> krambiorix: console.time('your-id') console.timeEnd('your-id')
[10:06:11] <duch_kazatel> lol i was about to say.
[10:06:17] <duch_kazatel> name yer timer.
[10:06:23] <BillCriswell> console.time('foo'); console.timeEnd('foo')
[10:06:43] <krambiorix> Cork , cool! thanks
[10:07:13] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OvexoBew/1/edit can aything think of a more clever way to do this?
[10:07:13] <BillCriswell> Preferably no JS.
[10:07:25] <BillCriswell> And keeping it DRY.
[10:07:55] <Whiskey> Cork :D
[10:08:15] <Whiskey> Time to check the fiddle now?
[10:08:42] <Cork> BillCriswell: i know a few ways
[10:08:54] <Cork> but i don't think i know of a way to do it cross browsers
[10:09:06] <Cork> also your example breaks if it word wraps
[10:09:40] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah. but you inadvertently get to style colors by line!
[10:09:45] <BillCriswell> As long as there's only two.
[10:09:56] <BillCriswell> style text by line*
[10:10:15] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/b3UwB/ <-- thats the fiddle Cork
[10:10:26] <BillCriswell> Cork: Wanted to avoid canvas and masking, not sure I can.
[10:10:41] <jeff___> hi
[10:10:48] <tandroid> jsbin is so much better than jsfiddle. I'm just realizing this
[10:11:08] <jeff___> I really need some help with a jquery error in the opentok api... please please help
[10:11:10] <remysharp> tandroid: <3
[10:11:10] <Cork> tandroid: except it breaks quite often
[10:11:21] <tandroid> Cork: oh that's no good
[10:11:22] <remysharp> Cork: when does it break?!
[10:11:36] <duch_kazatel> jeff___ post your code example and explain your problem.  if somebody can help, they will.
[10:11:44] <Cork> remysharp: every other update the js breaks
[10:11:49] <jeff___> ok..
[10:11:59] <Cork> and i need to inject js in the page to fix it to get the site running
[10:12:00] <BillCriswell> The only oddness I get with jsfiddle is some times the js won't run on the inital load.
[10:12:08] <BillCriswell> with jsbin*
[10:12:10] <BillCriswell> not fiddle.
[10:12:41] <Cork> kinda liked the old jsbin :)
[10:12:49] <Cork> was dead simple
[10:12:54] <BillCriswell> I wish I could give you something more definite than "sometimes" remysharp.
[10:13:24] <jeff___> OpenTok errors, here is the code: https://gist.github.com/iftikhar0005/8673070  please help
[10:13:25] <Cork> Whiskey: i'm still not sure what i'm suppose to look at
[10:14:16] <Whiskey> Cork: Switch View: Text <-- click on text and then you see what happens
[10:17:15] <jeff___> Anybody knows what this error is:
[10:17:17] <jeff___> [ERROR] opentok: UIComponent :: replaceElementId does not exist in DOM. TB.min.js:36 p TB.min.js:36 window.opentokdebug.h.(anonymous function) TB.min.js:36 aG TB.min.js:36 (anonymous function) TB.min.js:36 onLoad TB.min.js:36 _.load TB.min.js:36 U TB.min.js:36 b.initPublisher TB.min.js:36 sessionConnectedHandler 335:179 (anonymous function) TB.min.js:36     Uncaught Error: UIComponent :: replaceElementId does not exist in DOM. TB.mi
[10:17:18] <remysharp> Cork: you mean *your* updates or our new builds?
[10:17:44] <jeff___> Opentok errors help please: https://gist.github.com/iftikhar0005/8673070
[10:17:53] <duch_kazatel> jeff___ stop asking.
[10:17:57] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will.
[10:18:42] <jeff___> ok, i am going nuts with the error...i;ve been awake all night..sorry
[10:18:59] <duch_kazatel> it's fine, but you're spamming the channel, which will make people less inclined to help.
[10:19:00] <Whiskey> Cork, did you get the problem
[10:19:30] <Cork> remysharp: i meant the jsbin.com site
[10:19:57] <remysharp> Cork: ah, well that's not good. There was recently a problem where strict was deployed and fucked up a bunch of things.
[10:20:07] <BinaryKitten> i've never heard of opentok
[10:20:09] <remysharp> But we're adding more and more tests
[10:20:27] <duch_kazatel> jeff___ this code same is either incomplete, or you're not doing something very basic.
[10:20:32] <Cork> remysharp: one of the annoying parts is ex the fix you added for the localStorage
[10:20:45] <Cork> and it keeps regressing over and over again
[10:21:13] <Cork> there are a few other similar things i've seen from time to time
[10:21:14] <remysharp> Cork: not sure I follow. It would be really valuable if you could file an issue for me?
[10:21:28] <Cork> remysharp: the site works right now
[10:21:48] <Cork> remysharp: but we talked about this a few months back, and the site didn't load if localStorage was not available
[10:21:56] <jeff___>  <duch_kazatel>  it was just fine, but suddenly stopped working..what is it that i am missing ?
[10:22:17] <BinaryKitten> jeff___ what is it?
[10:22:19] <Cork> the fix you added then kept regress > refixed > regress and so on
[10:22:24] <remysharp> Cork: ah yes. That was a stupid security issue. I think I remember it now. It's not changed in a long time though.
[10:22:54] <Cork> remysharp: was i know it was broken back in november at least
[10:22:55] <jeff___>  <BinaryKitten>  here it is https://gist.github.com/iftikhar0005/8673070
[10:23:08] <jeff___> it is an api from opentok
[10:23:17] <BinaryKitten> ok jeff___ but what is openTok?
[10:23:32] <remysharp> Cork: yeah, that's possible. I'll take a look at the issues. I'm sure it's not been a problem again, but I always run with localStorage enabled.
[10:23:34] <BinaryKitten> and what's the connection with jQuery?
[10:23:38] <Whiskey> :/
[10:24:02] <Cork> remysharp: ya, and i'm a bit of a ten-foil-hat kind of guy :)
[10:24:17] <jeff___> i am not an expert on Jquery... but i am getting this error and it seems to be related to Jquery
[10:24:18] <Cork> so i disable most things and enable them if i think the site should have something
[10:24:19] <jeff___> [ERROR] opentok: UIComponent :: replaceElementId does not exist in DOM. TB.min.js:36 p TB.min.js:36 window.opentokdebug.h.(anonymous function) TB.min.js:36 aG TB.min.js:36 (anonymous function) TB.min.js:36 onLoad TB.min.js:36 _.load TB.min.js:36 U TB.min.js:36 b.initPublisher TB.min.js:36 sessionConnectedHandler 335:179 (anonymous function) TB.min.js:36     Uncaught Error: UIComponent :: replaceElementId does not exist in DOM. TB.mi
[10:24:19] <BinaryKitten> Cork ten?
[10:24:21] <remysharp> Cork: ha! that's cool - it's always worth having you guys :)
[10:24:43] <Cork> BinaryKitten: tin-foil-hat
[10:24:53] <BinaryKitten> jeff___ i don't see where jQuery is in that
[10:25:22] <Cork> so most sit i visit has no js and cross domain resource loading is blocked :)
[10:25:39] <Cork> localstorage, third party cookie off
[10:25:40] <Whiskey> Cork: do you find the problem?
[10:25:43] <Cork> and so on
[10:25:45] <BinaryKitten> seems an error in the javascript library provided by tokbox ... but not sure how that is jQuery .. which is a different framework
[10:25:51] <Whiskey> Cork: Or do you still not get it
[10:25:57] <BinaryKitten> jeff___ have you tried talking to tokbox?
[10:26:20] <jeff___> i have, but they are lazy bums...they don't reply
[10:26:42] <BinaryKitten> well not much we can do to help with a different framework
[10:27:02] <BinaryKitten> unless by sheer happenstance there is someone here that knows both jQuery and openTok
[10:27:11] <Cork> Whiskey: you don't want it to change width or what?
[10:27:33] <Whiskey> well i need to set the width after what screen user has as we talked about some h ago, and js have to masure that
[10:27:51] <Whiskey> so it use max width after how mutch width a user has on the screen'
[10:28:21] <BinaryKitten> Whiskey so i can't make the browser fit over 2 screens?
[10:28:26] <BinaryKitten> or rotate my display?
[10:28:29] <BillCriswell> jeff___: A live demo would help.
[10:28:46] <Cork> Whiskey: i know we have talked about this over and over again over the months, but i really don't see anything in that page that needs js for layout
[10:28:52] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell still think it's not really a jQuery related issue that jeff___ is having
[10:29:11] <jeff___> ok
[10:29:19] <BillCriswell> Could be a good point haha.
[10:29:38] <Whiskey> Cork, you can´t set it whit %
[10:29:46] <newbsduser> can change order of <li> elements of a <ul> random?=
[10:29:55] <Whiskey> try that and see if you can get that working, its need PX and PX will be diffrent depend on what screen you has
[10:29:56] <BinaryKitten> jeff___ sorry, but if we answered every other framework's issues we'd have no time to fix issues we have with jQuery
[10:29:57] <Cork> Whiskey: if you answer the question i could try :)
[10:30:09] <newbsduser> i just want to change order of <li> elements in a <uk>
[10:30:11] <Whiskey> that was an answer :)
[10:30:14] <newbsduser> i just want to change order of <li> elements in a <ul>
[10:30:18] <jeff___> ok
[10:30:21] <Cork> so you want the width to stay constant as you expand the second section?
[10:30:24] <jeff___> thanks anyways
[10:30:26] <BinaryKitten> newbsduser easy..
[10:30:34] <BinaryKitten> sorry jeff___ :(
[10:30:43] <BillCriswell> newbsduser: tsort() might be of use to you.
[10:30:54] <BinaryKitten> tsort?
[10:31:02] * BinaryKitten hasn't heard of that
[10:31:03] <BillCriswell> It's a jquery plugin.
[10:31:16] <BinaryKitten> ooh shiney
[10:31:16] <BillCriswell> http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/ this one.
[10:31:20] <newbsduser> BillCriswell, can i use  tsort for divs too?
[10:31:20] <BillCriswell> BEen useful in the past .
[10:31:22] <Cork> newbsduser: and if you want to do it without a plugin you would have to move the dom elements
[10:31:49] <BillCriswell> newbsduser: Yes.
[10:31:55] <BinaryKitten> depends if you want to sort it.. or just re-order them
[10:32:55] <BinaryKitten> remysharp hows the lower half of the country these days?
[10:33:00] <BillCriswell> newbsduser: $('.items .item').tsort({order:'rand'})
[10:33:16] <remysharp> BinaryKitten: warm and wet.
[10:33:21] <duch_kazatel> welp
[10:33:21] <BinaryKitten> heh
[10:33:31] <BinaryKitten> it's cold and wet up north
[10:33:36] <newbsduser> i will use it in jquery mobile
[10:33:39] <newbsduser> hope it works
[10:33:40] <newbsduser> let me try
[10:33:40] <BinaryKitten> it's like theres a wall and winter's coming
[10:33:48] <jedimind> best thing ive seen today: http://www.buildwithchrome.com/
[10:34:28] <BillCriswell> Oh god. Why did youhave to show me this.
[10:34:38] <BillCriswell> Close close close.
[10:34:48] <BillCriswell> Yes I'm sure I want to leave this page Chrome.
[10:34:59] <tandroid> Exactly what I just did. It's too much.
[10:35:04] <tandroid> too much fun
[10:35:30] <tandroid> I opened it in firefox. Is that bad?
[10:36:24] <newbsduser> BillCriswell, Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tsort'
[10:36:59] <BillCriswell> newbsduser: It sounds like you used the wrong path to the plugin?
[10:37:18] <BillCriswell> Is it 404ing?
[10:39:10] <jedimind> im sorry i cant hear you over the sound of my LEGO
[10:39:18] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha.
[10:41:23] <Whiskey> Cork: like 20-40px less the the screen that user is on
[10:41:56] <Whiskey> like if screen is 1920, it wuld be 1900px, and it its 1200 it would be 1180px
[10:43:41] <xmode> can someone help me out with this http://jsbin.com/InIBuCA/3/edit
[10:44:02] <xmode> i just want the tr once loaded to change color
[10:44:07] <xmode> but its not working
[10:44:28] <BillCriswell> You didn't include jQuery.
[10:44:47] <BillCriswell> Heads up thought, shouldn't have an id that starts with a number.
[10:45:01] <duch_kazatel> that's actually invalid.
[10:45:06] <ZzaichikK> ^^
[10:45:22] <duch_kazatel> and also, completely unnecessary (and slow!) to use tr[id=1]
[10:45:26] <ZzaichikK> you could use data attr instead if it's that important but no id/classname can start with a number
[10:45:30] <duch_kazatel> #1 does the exact same is is faster.
[10:45:51] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I just feel weird saying "you can't use an id that starts with a number" because you can and it'll work, but it's just because browsers are ok with it.
[10:45:51] <xmode> how can i fix this
[10:46:15] <RedShift> hey all, got some homework, small movie site thing with movies divided into categories, and I need to have a list of checkboxes to select which categories I want to see
[10:46:35] <BillCriswell> RedShift: Sounds easy enough.
[10:46:37] <duch_kazatel> xmode - http://jsbin.com/InIBuCA/6/edit?html,js,output
[10:46:43] <RedShift> what would the best way be to hide/show movies not belonging/not belonging to the categories?
[10:46:49] <xmode> let me see
[10:47:10] <BillCriswell> RedShift: You looking to use a plugin or are you building it from scratch?
[10:47:10] <RedShift> I was thinking about labelling the movies with the categories and then do something like $("#categoryx").hide() or .show() respectively
[10:47:22] <xmode> thanks duch works prfect
[10:47:30] <duch_kazatel> xmode of course.
[10:47:41] <xmode> :) apreaciated
[10:47:48] <duch_kazatel> RedShift i'd label using classes or data- attributes instead of IDs.
[10:47:56] <duch_kazatel> since a givevn ID can only appear once per page.
[10:48:05] <duch_kazatel> *given
[10:48:11] <RedShift> no plugins unfortunately, I have to do it with the standard jquery library, obviously there are better ways to do this but I'm not allowed to use them
[10:48:20] <RedShift> ok that's what I was thinking
[10:48:29] <xmode> i will remember that
[10:48:46] <ZzaichikK> personally, I don't like using id's unless absolutely necessary. Classnames for everything; easier to remember
[10:49:31] <RedShift> hmm data attributes, that sounds interesting
[10:49:35] <RedShift> that might be even better
[10:49:40] <RedShift> (new to HTML 5)
[10:50:19] <zubelgenubi> question about jqmobile - upgrading to 1.4 - I can't get the collapsible set headers to theme differently from the content. data-theme works, but also themes the content. data-content-theme not working
[10:51:11] <zubelgenubi> <div data-role="collapsible-set" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="a" data-collapsed-icon="arrow-r" data-expanded-icon="arrow-d">
[10:51:26] <zubelgenubi> shows headers and content as "b"
[10:51:31] <zubelgenubi> tips on diagnosing?
[10:51:59] <BillCriswell> RedShift: Did you get a source of data for the movies or is that all up to you?
[10:52:09] <RedShift> no did not get a source
[10:52:20] <BillCriswell> I'd love a nice "sample data" website.
[10:52:34] <RedShift> just some objectives to achieve, I just looked up some movie posters on google images and I'm using those
[10:52:59] <BillCriswell> "I need 100 movies with a fields: title, year, director"
[10:53:04] <BillCriswell> I should build that.
[10:53:09] <decx> rotten api?
[10:53:19] <BillCriswell> Never looked at that.
[10:53:26] <decx> it's pretty sweet
[10:53:30] <BillCriswell> Ah, have to register.
[10:56:12] <BillCriswell> Heh, API has an undocumented one: http://www.imdb.com/xml/find?xml=1&nr=1&tt=on&q=city+of_god
[10:56:28] <BillCriswell> Switching xml to json 404's. ='(
[10:57:18] <Whiskey> Ba Cork :(
[10:59:43] <bowenac> anyone see anything wrong with this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/XkJAP/
[11:00:17] <bowenac> (this).parent('.classname').find('.classname') isn't working
[11:00:28] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to select?
[11:00:45] <Lope> what's wrong with this? $a.parent().siblings().css('background-color','yellow');
[11:01:11] <BillCriswell> Lope: Nothing.
[11:01:38] <bowenac> dutch_kazatel was that to me?
[11:02:03] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:02:25] <bowenac> I'm trying to show the hidden div if the select = Yes
[11:02:31] <bowenac> but also work for each cloned item
[11:02:38] <decx> bowenac .hiddenItem isnt a child of .circle_custom
[11:02:58] <duch_kazatel> bowenac I can't find your broken code in there.
[11:03:04] <decx> jQuery(this) refers to .circle_custom
[11:03:13] <decx> and you try to find inside that
[11:03:29] <bowenac> right I am using         jQuery(this).parent('.selectDropDown').find('.hiddenItem').css('display','block');
[11:03:39] <duch_kazatel> where?
[11:03:43] <duch_kazatel> bowenac where is that code?
[11:04:01] <bowenac> if I use         jQuery('.hiddenItem').css('display','block'); it will change all of them
[11:04:01] <duch_kazatel> inside your On?
[11:04:09] <bowenac> yes
[11:04:12] <decx> .selectDropDown doesnt have hiddenItem as a child either
[11:04:33] <bowenac> child?
[11:04:39] <bowenac> does find only work for children?
[11:04:42] <duch_kazatel> yes
[11:04:46] <bowenac> next doesnt work either
[11:05:01] <duch_kazatel> .find() does a deep search of the current node.
[11:05:05] <bowenac> I thought find stepped through
[11:05:14] <bowenac> ok
[11:05:17] <decx> next works for me
[11:05:24] <decx> this.parent().next()
[11:05:37] <duch_kazatel> right, because it's the node after the current parent.
[11:05:45] <bowenac> it will control the cloned though
[11:06:53] <bowenac> this.parent().next() causes each new clone hidden to be displayed
[11:07:00] <Lope> I've done similar things successfully. but now I'm struggling with this: <a href='g($(this));'>test</a> function g($a) { $a.hide();   }
[11:07:14] <Lope> if I console.log $a.length it has length 1
[11:07:20] <bowenac> because its then cloning the hidden shown
[11:07:32] <decx> yeah with the cloning you add another layer of complexity bowenac but your initial problem was targeting the right element
[11:07:58] <zubelgenubi> Collapsible set problem in jquery mobile: http://jsfiddle.net/84T3Z/
[11:08:17] <zubelgenubi> Also, why does my logout button drop below the footer bar? (chrome)
[11:10:37] <Lope> why does <a href='javascript: f(this);'>foo</a> this give me Window instead of the a element?
[11:10:56] <duch_kazatel> because inline javascript is an awful thing.
[11:10:58] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[11:11:06] <Lope> yeah, onclick events work better.
[11:11:19] <duch_kazatel> you mean onclick=""?
[11:11:27] <duch_kazatel> because those are still awful.
[11:11:37] <Lope> they work.
[11:11:40] <duch_kazatel> but the reason is likely because the script executes on the page level.
[11:11:49] <duch_kazatel> setting the href like that changes out the URL.
[11:12:07] <Lope> oh, yeah I'll just dump the a tag thing.
[11:12:35] <decx> why are people so reluctant to use buttons for buttons instead of anchors?
[11:12:37] <duch_kazatel> put your js in a separate file entirely imo.
[11:12:55] <Lope> yeah I will
[11:13:09] <zubelgenubi> is there a different channel for jq mobile?
[11:13:29] <BinaryKitten> decx usually due to old ie which used to block button based events if the button wasn't in a form
[11:13:55] <decx> oh right, now i remember
[11:14:30] <BillCriswell> Underscore is so aweosme.
[11:14:46] <thaifood> hi
[11:15:14] <thaifood> what's the best free carousel/slider please ?
[11:15:25] <duch_kazatel> bxslider is a popular one.
[11:15:26] <bowenac> ok here is an updated one with a hidden div that is being used for the clone so that it clones with it hidden http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/XkJAP/2/
[11:15:27] <decx> depends who you're asking
[11:15:45] <duch_kazatel> I think the best carousel/slider is the one you don't use.
[11:15:49] <thaifood> thanks duch_kazatel
[11:15:59] <decx> bxslider, flexslider, coda slider,
[11:16:02] <thaifood> oh i'm using one baby ! :-)
[11:16:02] <bowenac> so the on change still only works for the initial one is that because the cloned aren't part of the dom?
[11:16:32] <BillCriswell> bowenac: You need to pass true to clone to copy events too.
[11:16:40] <thaifood> thanks decx !
[11:17:02] <decx> i like flexslider personally, handles loading slides dynamically pretty good
[11:17:22] <thaifood> cool
[11:17:53] <thaifood> coda slider looks like it's now   http://liquidslider.com/
[11:18:08] <bowenac> sweet that worked thanks
[11:18:10] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/XkJAP/3/
[11:19:12] <decx> seems like it, but why would they give up on an established brand
[11:19:17] <decx> strange
[11:19:34] <BillCriswell> It amazes me how popular sliders have gotten.
[11:20:10] <thaifood> BillCriswell that's because apple users can't read :-)
[11:20:12] <thaifood> need pictures
[11:20:17] <decx> what's better than 1 header picture?
[11:20:18] <BillCriswell> Did they ever provide good results towards a goal?
[11:20:19] <decx> 10!
[11:20:20] <decx> ;)
[11:20:24] <BinaryKitten> bowenac http://jsfiddle.net/XkJAP/4/
[11:20:42] <BillCriswell> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[11:20:46] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaaaaaaay
[11:20:56] <Lope> how can I do the current element AND it's siblings? $(e.target).siblings().css('background-color','yellow');
[11:21:14] <thaifood> BillCriswell no pictures, did not read :-)
[11:21:30] <decx> i remember the hacker news discussion about that site BillCriswell . it's pretty polemic in its argumentation
[11:21:38] <BillCriswell> Lope: andSelf
[11:21:44] <bowenac> BinaryKitten whats the difference from that and the updated one I posted that works?
[11:21:53] <RedShift> nice, my category system is working
[11:22:06] <RedShift> even used bitmasking, they've got nothing on me
[11:22:06] <Lope> BillCriswell:  where?
[11:22:17] <Lope> .siblings().andSelf() ?
[11:22:49] <BillCriswell> Lope: Think that'll work.
[11:23:20] <BillCriswell> decx: I could agree with that.
[11:23:56] <BinaryKitten> bowenac it uses delegation
[11:24:04] <BillCriswell> Lope: Crap, that's deprecated.
[11:24:23] <synth_> if i have a input with "data-name" set, how can i use that as a selector?
[11:24:35] <decx> $('[data-name]')
[11:24:40] <synth_> awesome, thank you
[11:24:43] <BillCriswell> Lope: Might be better off just doing .closest('.parent').find('.foo')
[11:27:13] <BillCriswell> RedShift: Sounds fanyc.
[11:27:41] <RedShift> yes
[11:27:42] <RedShift> yes it is
[11:29:31] <BillCriswell> Genre is a weird word.
[11:29:54] <zubelgenubi> Hey all, JQM 1.4 issue: i figured out that data-content-theme is not inherited by listviews inside a collapsible. Is this a bug? or is there a way to change this behavior? the theming inherited properly in 1.3...
[11:30:10] <Lope> is it easy to get keyboard presses in? like left and right arrows? (no input elements in page)
[11:31:29] <duch_kazatel> Lops sure.  they're still events.
[11:31:36] <duch_kazatel> err, Lope
[11:31:43] <duch_kazatel> I'd read up about events and delegation.
[11:31:44] <decx> with jquery it is #straighttomarketing
[11:32:29] <BinaryKitten> bowenac when cloning items etc like you are delegation can reduce memory usage
[11:32:41] <BinaryKitten> but each way is a valid way
[11:32:54] <BinaryKitten> just two choices :)
[11:33:00] <duch_kazatel> bowenac left.
[11:33:08] <BinaryKitten> bah
[11:33:13] <BinaryKitten> left during my typing
[11:33:19] <BinaryKitten> :(
[11:33:21] <BinaryKitten> oh well
[11:33:27] <BinaryKitten> delegation ftw!
[11:33:36] <BinaryKitten> </point.
[11:33:37] <BinaryKitten> >
[11:33:43] <synth_> :<
[11:33:56] <decx> i learned something from if BinaryKitten :)
[11:34:12] <duch_kazatel> event bubbling is a good thing.
[11:39:45] <krambiorix> are there other options for jquery ui theming than themeroller?
[11:41:56] <jastor> krambiorix, Yes . By doing everything by hand
[11:42:01] <jedimind> ^ that
[11:44:44] <thaifood> Are there any free sliders that have panels on the side too ?
[11:45:26] <decx> panel on the side?
[11:45:47] <thaifood> like this:  http://sunriverstudios.com/index.php
[11:46:05] <thaifood> that one says TM slider in the js file but i don't know where to get one
[11:46:28] <thaifood> i like the panel text that follows the image
[11:51:20] <jsc802> is there any way to do a $('#Form').submit(function(e){ but only if a certain input box is used
[11:51:48] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 sure - capture the submit and test for the input box.
[11:52:58] <jsc802> http://www.lunabazaar.com/mf02-mexican-amor-flag.aspx <-- i only want add to cart submit to have message, not search bar submit
[11:54:59] <BillCriswell> RedShift: I wanted to play around with underscore a little bit so I tried out your homework: http://jsbin.com/OqupoKe/1/edit
[11:55:18] <BillCriswell> It doesn't update the view or anything but it console.table() the results.
[11:55:50] <RedShift> nice code
[11:56:48] <RedShift> I like the fact that you allowed movies to be multiple genres
[11:56:51] <RedShift> mine didn't have that
[11:57:24] <BillCriswell> RedShift: You said checkboxes so I assumed that.
[11:57:31] <BillCriswell> Otherwise I'd think they wanted a select.
[11:57:39] <BillCriswell> they'd want a select*
[11:58:12] <RedShift> I think the point of the excercise was to allow multiple selections
[11:58:30] <RedShift> so you could display only your favorite genres
[11:58:46] <BillCriswell> Right. I'd assume that too.
[12:02:35] <BillCriswell> I should have tried to do this in angular. =/
[12:03:38] <BillCriswell> Cause I feel the need to learn that shit.
[12:03:46] <duch_kazatel> backbone imo
[12:03:55] <BillCriswell> Need to learn that shit too.
[12:04:00] <BillCriswell> Need to learna lot of shit.
[12:04:05] <evilbug> shiiiit...
[12:04:14] <duch_kazatel> you started pokin' at underscore - same dude.
[12:04:58] <BillCriswell> My gut is telling me to learn Angular. The last time my gut told me something it was right.
[12:05:18] <evilbug> BillCriswell: no doubt.
[12:05:44] <duch_kazatel> meh.  i don't like templating like that personally.  but i'm crazy apparently.  riot.js is a thing of beauty.
[12:06:05] <evilbug> i like jade.
[12:06:10] <BillCriswell> I saw you post something about that the other day, looked at the website then forgot about it.
[12:06:34] <BillCriswell> I should look again.
[12:07:04] <BillCriswell> I liked the looks of HAML, never actually used it though.
[12:07:15] <BillCriswell> evilbug: Are you using express?
[12:15:10] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/LvsYc/   <-- how do i upload the image to my server with a submit button?
[12:16:57] <duch_kazatel> tables by using a form
[12:17:19] <duch_kazatel> tables what's your server-side language?
[12:17:20] <BillCriswell> tables: You have to use the right enctype.
[12:17:25] <tables> what would the input be for the image that's supposed to be uploaded?
[12:17:40] <BillCriswell> type="file" like you have.
[12:17:47] <duch_kazatel> tables you have to setup your server to accept it.
[12:18:03] <BillCriswell> enctype="multipart/form-data" on the form as well.
[12:18:05] <BillCriswell> I'm tired.
[12:18:47] <BillCriswell> Also, type="post"
[12:18:55] <trewd6> Can I still access this div after i've hidden it? $("#parentDiv").next('div.input-error').show();
[12:19:14] <tables> <input type='file' id="imgInp" />           <-- so the file uploaded gets sent to the server?
[12:19:41] <BillCriswell> trewd6: Yes.
[12:20:09] <duch_kazatel> trewd6 yes, it's still in the document.
[12:20:11] <BillCriswell> tables: Yes, if you're in php I think the data related to the upload is in $_FILE
[12:20:24] <trewd6> BillCriswell: the selector is returning length[0] when I do that eventhough it's in my code
[12:20:46] <duch_kazatel> trewd sounds like a bad selector.
[12:20:51] <tables> BillCriswell, thx
[12:21:00] <BillCriswell> What duch_kazatel said fo sho.
[12:21:29] <BillCriswell> tables: No problem.
[12:23:15] <trewd6> BillCriswell: it's finding it the first time but when it tries the second time it doesn't... weird
[12:23:53] <duch_kazatel> trewd6 how are you hiding it?
[12:24:07] <duch_kazatel> wait you're using .next();?
[12:24:22] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, good catch lol.
[12:24:32] <duch_kazatel> that's your problem.
[12:24:42] <trewd6> duch_kazatel: elem.next('div.input-error').hide();
[12:25:00] <trewd6> duch_kazatel: why?
[12:25:54] <duch_kazatel> hrm, maybe not.  could you share some code with us in a fiddle?
[12:27:44] <trewd6> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/43bk3/1/
[12:27:50] <trewd6> duch_kazatel: weird it works on jsfiddle
[12:27:59] <trewd6> I have the same code thoguh
[12:28:28] <BillCriswell> trewd6: Are you moving the div?
[12:28:29] <navneet_> hi
[12:29:32] <alaing> who needs help? I'm in a helping mode
[12:29:49] <trewd6> BillCriswell: nope
[12:30:21] <jedimind> alaing my back itches in a spot i cant reach
[12:30:58] <alaing> jedimind: I'll scratch yours if you scratch mine :-P
[12:31:10] <jedimind> deal!
[12:31:15] <trewd6> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/43bk3/2/
[12:31:18] <trewd6> there it is reproduced
[12:31:59] <alaing> trewd6: what you trying to achieve?
[12:32:27] <trewd6> the div (blah) stops showing  after the first time
[12:32:39] <trewd6> try to focus and blur and you won't see the div anymore
[12:32:44] <trewd6> you only see it on the first blur
[12:33:39] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking .tooltip is moving your element.
[12:33:54] <alaing> trewd6: ah, with you now
[12:34:35] <slick-zendog> if you got two problems i feel bad for you son
[12:34:35] <BillCriswell> trewd6: The tooltip slips in between the input and the error message.
[12:35:07] <trewd6> BillCriswell: but i'm specifically asking for div.input-error
[12:35:13] <trewd6> so it should grab the next available one
[12:35:18] <BillCriswell> trewd6: That doesn't mean shit in .next
[12:35:31] <BillCriswell> .nextAll() might work?
[12:36:07] <trewd6> BillCriswell: you're right
[12:36:08] <BillCriswell> Think you might be better off doing .closest('.input-group-lg').find('.input-error')
[12:36:09] <trewd6> it does
[12:36:18] <BillCriswell> Why would I lie to you?
[12:36:21] <BillCriswell> =)
[12:36:35] <BillCriswell> That would be a pretty mean think to make up.
[12:36:40] <BillCriswell> I wish I was that clever.
[12:38:33] <alaing> lol @ BillCriswell
[12:38:56] <trewd6> BillCriswell: elem.closest('.input-group-lg').find('.input-error') however does not work
[12:39:03] <trewd6> :)
[12:39:23] <trewd6> LIES!!
[12:40:02] <alaing> Ah, it should work
[12:40:15] <trewd6> http://jsfiddle.net/43bk3/5/
[12:40:17] <trewd6> does not work
[12:40:26] <alaing> unless you removed the class .input-error
[12:40:57] <trewd6> here http://jsfiddle.net/43bk3/7/
[12:41:10] <alaing> thats because you not doinging anything with it
[12:41:15] <alaing> elem.closest('.input-group-lg').find('.input-error').show()
[12:41:17] <alaing> ?
[12:41:54] <trewd6> ok then i lied
[12:41:58] <trewd6> thanks guys
[12:42:11] <alaing> I think you need to apologise to BillCriswell :-D
[12:42:30] <alaing> anyone going to jqueyr uk?
[12:42:37] <alaing> jquery even :-D
[12:43:38] <BillCriswell> A jQuery event would be a good time I bet.
[12:43:58] <duch_kazatel> a lolsy event, at least.
[12:44:27] <BillCriswell> I went to a Drupal Conference once. Not sure I'll do that again.
[12:44:56] <duch_kazatel> i feel like that'd be a depressing one
[12:45:04] <duch_kazatel> "welp.  all 5 of us are here..."
[12:45:52] <BillCriswell> There were a lot of people, everyone seemed cool, but I just wasn't that up to speed with Drupal. There was like beginner and expert talks, nothing in the middle.
[12:46:09] <krambiorix> i want to connect my divs like this: http://www.nait.ca/images/content/HorizontalHierarchy.jpg   how can i do that?
[12:46:54] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Ehhh
[12:47:50] <alaing> krambiorix: suggest you use pen and paper :-P
[12:47:58] <alaing> and possibly a ruler
[12:48:14] <alaing> BillCriswell: I went to jQuery UK last year.
[12:48:19] <alaing> was pretty interesting
[12:48:27] <alaing> but the side talks were good as well
[12:48:51] <krambiorix> alaing, they didn't talk about connecting divs in jquery?
[12:49:02] <BillCriswell> I'd mostly go for the side talks.
[12:49:53] <alaing> BillCriswell: this year they having 3 tracks
[12:50:15] <alaing> krambiorix: i think you will find you did ask it in this channel
[12:50:30] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/demo/home/jquery.html ?
[12:51:01] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yeah i found that too but it's too much functionality... I only need the line
[12:52:07] <alaing> theres a simplier one, BillCriswell I havent come across that. any idea what the browser support is like for that plugin. not to worry if not
[12:52:16] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Do you need interactivity?
[12:52:20] <BillCriswell> alaing: I have no idea haha.
[12:52:23] <dAnjou> MrFox: away nicks kind of suck
[12:52:43] <dAnjou> yeah
[12:52:45] <alaing> krambiorix: https://github.com/wesnolte/jOrgChart
[12:52:46] <BillCriswell> alaing: I'd probaly just make an image to be honest if it didn't need to be interactive.
[12:53:33] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, no intereactivity needed
[12:53:39] <alaing> BillCriswell: wow it supports everyting from ie6 up
[12:53:44] <dAnjou> MrFox[afk]: http://freenode.net/poundfreenode.shtml#considerate
[12:53:55] <krambiorix> alaing, great suggestion (you see; if you try , you can do it) :P
[12:54:07] <alaing> krambiorix: so can google :-P
[12:54:12] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: I'd use an image. Forget all that.
[12:54:16] <BillCriswell> alaing: Damn.
[12:54:47] <alaing> I have to do an org chart in IE7
[12:55:02] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i could but what about my divs?
[12:55:10] <alaing> I like the flashy plugin
[12:55:32] <alaing> my chart had to be drawn up using data from DB
[12:55:39] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: That seems like it should be an unordered list to me, and I'd probably just hide it.
[12:58:22] <alaing> BillCriswell: that one I posted does just use  ul w hiwhc you hide
[12:58:34] <BillCriswell> alaing: I must have missed that.
[12:58:43] <BillCriswell> Was logged out briefly.
[12:58:59] <alaing> 	krambiorix: https://github.com/wesnolte/jOrgChart
[12:59:13] <alaing> uses ul which you can hide
[12:59:29] <alaing> it builds a table and links all the crap together
[12:59:37] <BillCriswell> Ah. interesting.
[13:01:35] <krambiorix> hmm the thing is , all my boxes are divs
[13:01:54] <MrFox> sorry guys :DD
[13:02:16] <MrFox> its an automatic thing
[13:02:24] <dAnjou> then turn it off
[13:02:28] <MrFox> gonna find a asetting to turn it off
[13:03:10] <MrFox> done
[13:03:17] <dAnjou> thanks
[13:03:17] <alaing> krambiorix: why does it have to be divs?
[13:04:04] <krambiorix> alaing,  hmm i can change them to be li's ... I found this: http://www.capricasoftware.co.uk/projects/jquery-orgchart/demo1.html   but i want it horizontal
[13:05:35] <BillCriswell> Not sure it supports that.
[13:05:44] <BillCriswell> I'd really just us an image.
[13:06:17] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, then i have to put all my divs in the very very correct place
[13:07:54] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: I wouldn't even do that. <img src="whole-damn-chart.gif" alt="">.
[13:08:09] <BillCriswell> This is a lot of work to put into something that's just displaying some information.
[13:09:45] <alaing> I agree with BillCriswell
[13:09:52] <alaing> if you dont want it to be interactive
[13:09:59] <alaing> and its not dynamic
[13:10:14] <alaing> then just serve up that img you posted here?
[13:10:50] <shodan45> this an ok place for questions on datatables (datatables.net)?
[13:10:56] <alaing> you could easily style it whatever you liked using your favrouite imaging software or MS Office product
[13:10:59] <krambiorix> but all my div css is dynamic
[13:11:22] <alaing> div css isdynamic?
[13:11:33] <krambiorix> depending on data in database, they have a red background or border...
[13:11:37] <alaing> please explain more
[13:12:02] <alaing> so they are dynamic then
[13:12:12] <krambiorix> alaing, yes
[13:13:03] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Post the output to jsbin.
[13:13:39] <BillCriswell> If it's just a mess of divs with no structure you'll just have to position them all individually, which is going to suck.
[13:14:32] <BillCriswell> You'll also need some extra classes applied to elements so you can use like background images or something to draw the lines.
[13:14:42] <BillCriswell> There really is no good way if all you have is a mess of divs.
[13:15:09] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i don't have much code yet, just some divs relatively put on the page
[13:16:49] <alaing> krambiorix: we just want to see how these divs are structured
[13:17:06] <krambiorix> one wrapper div  with (now) 5 divs in it
[13:17:24] <alaing> but its starting to get late....
[13:17:35] <alaing> eyes are sagging
[13:17:56] <alaing> take cares ppl
[13:22:56] <krambiorix> ok forget it, i won't use it :D  thanks anyways BillCriswell  / alaing !!!
[13:23:35] <alaing> krambiorix: no probs hope you fin a solution
[13:27:18] <zim> Hi all can I target more than one thing? $('body').on('click', '.foo AND .bar', function (event) {
[13:27:52] <shoky> '.foo, .bar'
[13:28:05] <zim> shoky: TY
[13:29:49] <petey> is it possible to pluck out something like an li, and paste it back in there
[13:29:51] <petey> i have a client who doesn't like the fact that the carousel "rewinds" back to the beginning
[13:30:07] <petey> so I'm looking to pull out the li and paste it back in there
[13:40:48] <BillCriswell> petey: Are you trying to skip all the slides in between the start and end?
[13:41:40] <petey> billcriswell, something like that
[13:41:42] <petey> continuous scrolling
[13:42:17] <BillCriswell> petey: Which slider are you currently using?
[13:42:42] <BillCriswell> cycle2 handles it the way you seem to want: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/prevnext.php
[13:43:01] <petey> This is just a custom written slider with a mask and moves the list to the left as it scrolls
[13:43:14] <petey> the problem is once you hit the end it "rewinds" and I'd like to see if there's an easy method to fix this
[13:43:31] <flobin> hi, I have a small jquery question dealing with a site that is pretty awful (it's not mine, my friend asked me to add a slider to it): http://vw.robinberghuijs.com/vietnam/vrijwilligerswerk_vietnam.html
[13:43:44] <flobin> basically jquery isn't loading and I can't figure out why
[13:43:44] <petey> THat is what I want billcriswell, but is there a specific type of logic behind this?
[13:43:53] <petey> I suppose I will go through the code, thanks!
[13:44:02] <flobin> if anyone could help me figure out why jquery isn't loading, that'd be awesome
[13:44:16] <BillCriswell> petey: I'd imagine it just grabs the previous and next as it needs it without just having one long row of images.
[13:44:20] <ace263> does anyone know anything about php2 that facebook made?  is it even public?
[13:44:50] <petey> Damn I have one long row of images :(
[13:45:27] <BillCriswell> flobin: It's loading.
[13:46:06] <BillCriswell> flobin: The issue is that the site is loading the latest version of jQuery, but a plugin on the site is using deprecated stuff.
[13:46:23] <flobin> BillCriswell: aha! which plugin would that be?
[13:46:40] <flobin> BillCriswell: in lines 222 - 226 (view source) I have a bit that should give every <p> a green border, as a test to see if it's working
[13:46:47] <flobin> so that's what I thought jquery wasn't loading at all
[13:46:49] <BillCriswell> EvoSlider it looks like.
[13:46:59] <flobin> ah, thanks, BillCriswell!
[13:47:43] <flobin> may I ask how you can tell?
[13:47:43] <BillCriswell> flobin: Could save yourself some headache by using jQuery 1.8 probably
[13:47:51] <BillCriswell> I looked at the error console.
[13:48:46] <BillCriswell> I'd use //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js instead of http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js for my jQuery call.
[13:48:57] <flobin> right, cool
[13:49:00] <BillCriswell> flobin
[13:49:27] <BillCriswell> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js will always be the latest code, shouldn't be used in production.
[13:49:39] <duch_kazatel> aye
[13:50:08] <flobin> yeah, I wasn't planning on keeping that, I was using that because I thought jquery wasn't loading at all and I wanted to try some different things
[13:50:35] <flobin> so in the error console, what tells you the wrong version isn't loading? I need to get better at diagnosing this kind of stuff, so if you have any tips, that'd be great
[13:50:47] <BillCriswell> flobin: Got it. Another issue is SpryMenuBar.js is 404ing
[13:51:03] <flobin> yeah, that one I saw, I have no idea what it is
[13:51:21] <flobin> he just asked me to put the slider in, so I'm just going to do that, first anyway
[13:52:02] <BillCriswell> flobin: I just saw "Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined " which usually means Microsoft Internet Explorer usually, so I figured a plugin was doing some browser detection.
[13:52:14] <flobin> aha
[13:52:18] <BillCriswell> and I know jQuery totally removed that in 1.9
[13:52:29] <flobin> well, that is very clever
[13:53:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, so 1.8.3 is the latest version you can use in unison with that slider dealie.
[13:53:23] <flobin> yup, thank you very much!
[13:53:28] <flobin> it seems to be working now
[13:53:37] <flobin> more or less anyway
[13:53:49] <BillCriswell> No problem! Glad it's working.
[14:21:01] <ShawnRisk> I am using the HTML5 audio tag, and wondering how to make my code this: http://pastebin.com/n65HHm1W work on a mobile browser?  Right now the mobile opens a new audio player, doesn't use the audio player on the page, any ideas?
[14:21:55] <IamTrying> 1) www.mainsite.com - has a iframe1 which loads www.site1.com   2) inside the iframe1 it has another iframe2 3) http://fpaste.org/72561/39094755/   - but why this iframe is not opening?
[14:24:39] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk which mobile browser?
[14:25:05] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: using Chrome but any mobile browser
[14:25:49] <duch_kazatel> http://pupunzi.open-lab.com/2013/03/13/making-html5-audio-actually-work-on-mobile/ - this help at all?
[14:26:52] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I read that but didn't help
[14:27:05] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[14:28:04] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: is my jQuery code wrong?
[14:28:17] <duch_kazatel> didn't get a chance to comb over it tbh.
[14:28:39] <ShawnRisk> tbh?
[14:28:42] <duch_kazatel> to be honest
[14:29:42] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: well shouldn't audio just work on a mobile browser until my code is wrong?
[14:29:51] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea.
[14:29:56] <ShawnRisk> oh
[14:30:08] <duch_kazatel> i don't know how good audio support is.
[14:43:22] <ShawnRisk> anyone else can help with my code?
[14:49:13] <waiiiirc> just post your issue, someone usually helps
[14:50:00] <duch_kazatel> i tried to help but wasn't able to.
[14:52:00] <waiiiirc> ah ic
[14:53:17] <bowenac> can someone explain this to me specifically the on change parent parent parent etc http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/BLbxj/
[14:53:57] <bowenac> it seems to only work by using $(this).parent().parent().parent().next('.customShowHide').css('display', 'block');
[14:54:30] <bowenac> which the parent is .form-row
[14:54:35] <bowenac> but using and $(this).parent('.form-row').next('.customShowHide').css('display', 'block'); doesnt work
[14:55:42] <bowenac> can you only target the immediate parent?
[14:55:49] <decx> yes
[14:55:55] <bowenac> can I not use it like getElementById
[14:55:59] <decx> parents() to look higher
[14:56:06] <bowenac> and target the specific parent
[14:56:27] <bowenac> is there an easier way or is doing it that way ok
[14:56:42] <bowenac> to get three targets up
[14:56:55] <bowenac> .prev?
[14:57:17] <ShawnRisk> I am using the HTML5 audio tag, and wondering how to make my code this: http://pastebin.com/n65HHm1W work on a mobile browser?  Right now the mobile opens a new audio player, doesn't use the audio player on the page, any ideas?
[14:57:32] <bowenac> prev doesnt work either
[14:57:42] <bowenac> has to be an easier way than parent parent parent parent haha
[14:57:46] <nycreal> or .closest('.form-row') to get the nearest parent that matches the selector
[14:58:35] <bowenac> that works thanks
[14:59:09] <nycreal> np
[14:59:59] <ShawnRisk> I only have 15 to 20 mins left before I have to go
[15:00:53] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: an id
[15:00:55] <ShawnRisk> any ideas?
[15:02:59] <nycreal> hm haven't done anything with audio players on mobile
[15:03:25] <nycreal> so the problem is a new audio element gets created instead of using the existing one?
[15:04:02] <nycreal> in your run() function, you use audio[0].load() and audio[0].play() instead of the "player" local variable
[15:04:10] <nycreal> maybe that's causing an issue?
[15:04:14] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: They open a new page with just the audio player, and not using the one that is on the page.
[15:04:40] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: what is the local variable?  The id?
[15:04:56] <nycreal> function run(link, player){
[15:04:56] <nycreal>                         player.src = link.attr('href');
[15:04:56] <nycreal>                         par = link.parent();
[15:04:56] <nycreal>                         par.addClass('active').siblings().removeClass('active');
[15:04:56] <nycreal>                         audio[0].load();
[15:04:56] <nycreal>                         audio[0].play();
[15:04:56] <nycreal>         }
[15:05:05] <nycreal> you use player.src at the beginning
[15:05:10] <nycreal> but audio[0] at the end
[15:05:38] <nycreal> it shouldn't make a difference tbh but since your're passing audio[0] as a parameter, i'd stay using the parameter variable within that function
[15:05:50] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: should I use player.load() and player.play()?
[15:06:03] <nycreal> i'd try that to see if it changes anything
[15:06:32] <ShawnRisk> okay
[15:08:10] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: no change
[15:08:42] <sdwrage> Hey all. Anyone here good with bxslider?
[15:09:25] <nycreal> not sure then, never used audio tag for mobile yet
[15:09:37] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: nuts, thanks for the help
[15:09:57] <ShawnRisk> nycreal: no other ideas?  This is weird.
[15:12:06] <ShawnRisk> I have to get going
[15:12:07] <ShawnRisk> thanks again
[15:12:13] <nycreal> hm i found this for the html5 audio api: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/
[15:12:23] <nycreal> seems to be a different approach than what you tried
[15:13:06] <ShawnRisk> yes it is different
[15:13:33] <ShawnRisk> I will be on later
[15:13:58] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am having a serious BXSlider issue: http://kingsdown.com/since-1904/
[15:15:05] <sdwrage> if you get to the last slide, it pops the first one under the last and the navigation no longer works
[15:34:37] <groundup> I have an object which is built like {'category':{'subcat':'subsubcat':true}} subcat and subsubcat aren't always present. I am trying to create a select box which gets the keys for the first level as the first select. Then if there is a second, use those keys, and so on. Are there any examples out there? My head just doesn't want to work right now
[15:36:07] <duch_kazatel> groundup you're going to have to test to see if there are any child properties.
[15:36:09] <duch_kazatel> manually.
[15:37:31] <groundup> http://jsfiddle.net/VANLh/ is what I'm working with
[15:39:15] <gnarf> you keep binding a ton of events there groundup
[15:39:21] <gnarf> you want one change event for each select
[15:39:26] <gnarf> figure out the "state" of things inside of it
[15:39:33] <duch_kazatel> and you don't need to use $.each() there, eiuther.
[15:39:36] <gnarf> don't go binding more events inside of event handlers
[15:39:38] <gnarf> bad idea
[15:39:49] <groundup> ok
[15:40:42] <groundup> The chain is when one of the "child" elements changes.
[15:41:02] <groundup> If cat1 changes, it needs to change cat2 and cat3
[15:43:44] <groundup> duch_kazatel, how do I add the options?
[15:44:21] <duch_kazatel> for (var prop in object) {if (object.hasOwnProperty(prop){/* your stuff here */}}
[15:44:27] <duch_kazatel> jquery's each is slow.
[15:45:20] <systemfault> But how many keys does his object have?
[15:46:19] <groundup> The top level has 9. Each with anywhere from 1 to ~20 keys. Each of those anywhere from 0 to ~10. Not much.
[15:46:21] <duch_kazatel> meh, i prefer to use the native loop instead so when the data expands I don't have to worry about it.
[15:46:22] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[15:46:31] <duch_kazatel> i've learned to be overly devensive.
[15:46:33] <duch_kazatel> *defensive
[15:46:52] <systemfault> Yeah... because any DOM call is going to be a ton slower than most $.each
[15:46:54] <groundup> I hear ya. TBH, I'll worry about making it faster after I get it working heh
[15:47:08] <duch_kazatel> sure - that's why you cache what you can.
[15:47:15] <duch_kazatel> i'm just in the habit at this point.
[15:48:23] <groundup> So, how do I make cat2 and cat3 change without "chaining" those events?
[15:54:22] <groundup> Maybe I should change the array to be a single dimension.
[15:54:27] <groundup> *object
[15:55:09] <duch_kazatel> you could detect the change event on each.
[15:55:13] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[16:01:14] <Guest99210> What might be the right language/tool for making a website that offers online drawing pad like MS paint or some UML modeling tool or a mixture?
[16:03:16] <duch_kazatel> javascript and canvas maybe?
[16:05:50] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  what is canvas?
[16:08:37] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas
[16:08:41] <duch_kazatel> a way to draw stuff
[16:16:18] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,   I would choose vectors for drawing uml or circle square lines or MS paint type of things. what technology/language would  can I use to make that drawing functionality on my website?
[16:16:37] <groundup> Okay, I got it working, but I am sure that I could have done it better: http://jsfiddle.net/VANLh/1/
[16:16:38] <duch_kazatel> probably svg + javascript.
[16:16:56] <duch_kazatel> lol i see you're in ##javascript.
[16:17:00] <duch_kazatel> i'll let them handle it ;)
[16:17:44] <decx> Guest99210 http://leimi.github.io/drawingboard.js/
[16:17:53] <decx> good start
[16:19:01] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 why do you keep askng "what technology/language"?
[16:19:12] <duch_kazatel> what else would us be able to use?
[16:23:56] <duch_kazatel> welp
[16:24:51] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,   1, what tools might be used? jQuery, flash? any other? 2. for comercial apps or extreme hardwork. you have to worry for stealers if the code is open
[16:25:05] <duch_kazatel> there's not much you can do.
[16:33:06] <tds5016> it looks like when I do put, with ajax's data: member... the value doens't get sent.
[16:34:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:34:05] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle?
[16:37:37] <zim> Hi all. Is there some jquery goodness to json encode a form?
[16:37:46] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/dzs6L/
[16:37:59] <tds5016> that's an example of it not sending data in my version of chrome.
[16:38:21] <duch_kazatel> zim http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[16:39:25] <zim> duch_kazatel: that just turns it into a string. foo=bar&bar=foo
[16:39:41] <duch_kazatel> define "json encode"
[16:39:59] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/dzs6L/1/
[16:40:03] <tds5016> that's the better version. sorry.
[16:41:14] <zim> {"foo":"bar","bar":"foo"}
[16:41:23] <zim> duch_kazatel: ^^
[16:41:28] <systemfault> jQuery only knows about form
[16:41:29] <duch_kazatel> ah, and toss that as a string via the put?
[16:41:41] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to manually craft that.
[16:42:04] <tds5016> duch_kazatel: is that to me?
[16:42:10] <duch_kazatel> no, to zim
[16:42:22] <tds5016> oh, sorry. similar sounding potential solution. lol.
[16:42:22] <duch_kazatel> and tds5016 you said your params aren't getting passed, right?
[16:42:32] <tds5016> I don't believe they are.
[16:42:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's because put doesn't support params.
[16:42:56] <tds5016> shit....
[16:43:00] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[16:43:02] <tds5016> is there a way around that?
[16:43:03] <duch_kazatel> sorry man.
[16:43:05] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:43:08] <zim> TY bugger. wrong chanel but is there a php function to arrayify  foo=bar&bar=foo
[16:43:19] <duch_kazatel> not that i know of.
[16:43:31] <tds5016> what in the hell? how are you supposed to put as update of REST if passing params isn't a thing?
[16:43:32] <duch_kazatel> but i don't do PHP
[16:43:49] <systemfault> tds5016: What do you want to do?
[16:44:00] <tds5016> send values to PUT to have models on my backend update.
[16:44:30] <systemfault> zim:  think there's parse_str
[16:44:45] <zim> Hi all systemfault ty
[16:44:57] <tds5016> essentially.... PUT http://ip/model?prop=value&value=value
[16:45:00] <synth_> is it possible to select based on attr that has a value? i know i can do $("[data-type]") for instance, but could i only select an element where an element has data-type="name"?
[16:45:03] <tds5016> something basically like that.
[16:45:05] <systemfault> tds5016: Doesn't make sense.
[16:45:11] <zim> systemfault: sorry halfway through asking ##php :-)
[16:45:30] <duch_kazatel> synth_ $("[data-type="name"]");
[16:45:31] <tds5016> systemfault: wht doesn't make sense? I wasnt to pass the value of prop and value to a put method
[16:45:34] <systemfault> tds5016: The only verb that allows query strings is GET>
[16:45:37] <systemfault> ->
[16:45:45] <synth_> thanks duch_kazatel
[16:45:52] <duch_kazatel> np synth_
[16:45:54] <synth_> figured it would be something easy like that
[16:45:55] <tds5016> I want to send strings to the server to allow the values to be updated on the server.
[16:46:09] <systemfault> tds5016: Then you want to send the info using the body of the request.
[16:46:18] <tds5016> how would I do that?
[16:46:30] <tds5016> with a jquery ajax request?
[16:46:40] <systemfault> Like I said, jQuery makes it stupidly difficult.... but yes, with $.ajax
[16:47:13] <tds5016> how would I do that?
[16:47:30] <tds5016> I've tried adding it with the data attribute; what am I missing? lol.
[16:48:46] <systemfault> It's been a while... but something like $.ajax({ url: '/sadasdsad/asdasdasd/', type: 'PUT', data: JSON.stringify({ lol: 42 }), processData: false, contentType: 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'}).done(........
[16:49:37] <systemfault> Or you can simply use data: ObjectHere if the server supports application/form-data
[16:51:47] <tds5016> appears not to have worked.
[16:51:55] <tds5016> application should work with application/form-data
[16:52:10] <tds5016> I'm expecting to the get this in the request.args section of the request though.
[16:52:12] <tds5016> on twisted.
[16:52:17] <tds5016> sooo... I might be going about that wrong.
[16:53:50] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/63QW4/
[16:53:55] <tds5016> that'sw hat I'm currently working with.
[16:54:00] <tds5016> it looks to not be working.
[16:54:26] <systemfault> If your server supports application/form-data, you don't need to make it that complicated.
[16:54:41] <tds5016> assuming it doens't it still doesn't work.
[16:54:47] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/63QW4/1/ should be enough
[16:55:10] <systemfault> But seriously... there could be something wrong serverside
[16:55:31] <systemfault> What is the server returning?
[16:55:34] <tds5016> there's a good chance of that at this point :-(
[16:55:35] <systemfault> What is the error
[16:55:46] <tds5016> server is running everything okay. it just doens't get any arguments.
[16:56:16] <systemfault> Is there a know problem or something special with you server-side environment?
[16:56:18] <systemfault> *known
[16:56:22] <systemfault> *your :(
[16:56:25] <tds5016> nope.
[16:56:27] <tds5016> not that I know of.
[16:56:30] <tds5016> I'm using twisted.
[16:57:23] <systemfault> You really need PUT?
[17:02:48] <enigmabomb> Im having a hard time using the val selector to get a drop downs value. It always says undefined. Here's the relevant code: http://pastebin.com/wQ8R5hU2
[17:03:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/DKvkj/
[17:03:44] <duch_kazatel> works for me.
[17:04:06] <duch_kazatel> make sure your javascript is running AFTER the HTML
[17:04:06] <JP_> Hi there, I'm having a few problems with dialog. I'm new to Jquery.  I want to make the read more bit also work with its title ie service 1  Any idea what to do? Here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/XQf44/
[17:04:21] <enigmabomb> ok I'll try that
[17:04:28] <enigmabomb> I'm running it past the body tag. Intereting.
[17:04:40] <duch_kazatel> woah - needs to be right before </body>
[17:04:42] <duch_kazatel> it can't be after.
[17:05:56] <duch_kazatel> JP_ you might want to learn about how to write functions.
[17:07:05] <JP_> duch_kazatel erm ok, what do I have to do to make this work?
[17:07:37] <duch_kazatel> first of all you're duplicating a lot of work - consider adding a class to your different dialogues and initing that way instead.
[17:08:38] <JP_> so this #dialog_1 into class etc
[17:09:35] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:09:38] <duch_kazatel> add a class to each.
[17:09:50] <duch_kazatel> like class="dialog"
[17:10:00] <tds5016> any other ideas on how I'd pass the arguments?
[17:10:47] <duch_kazatel> JP_ also it's invalid to have anything OTHER than lis as direct children of a <UL>
[17:12:59] <JP_> ah ok do I but the class i next to the div or in the <a>?
[17:13:14] <JP_> *put
[17:13:17] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[17:13:33] <JP_> ok thank you
[17:13:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/XQf44/1/
[17:13:45] <duch_kazatel> put it on each div.
[17:13:52] <duch_kazatel> <div class="dialogBox" id="dialog_1">
[17:14:40] <duch_kazatel> oh woah you have to init each separately.
[17:14:42] <duch_kazatel> hold up.
[17:14:46] <duch_kazatel> sorry one sec.
[17:14:58] <duch_kazatel> let me wrap up what i'm doing
[17:15:03] <enigmabomb> JSFiddle is awesome Ive never used this before
[17:15:31] <JP_> ok
[17:16:42] <duch_kazatel> well so wait what will each of these dialogs contain?
[17:17:55] <JP_> They will contain diffenernt text, so Service 1 will have its own text  Service 2 will also have its on text etc etc
[17:18:33] <duch_kazatel> because the smart way would be to init one dialog and then swap out the test based on which thing you clicked.
[17:19:56] <JP_> Ok, each dialog will have different infomation
[17:20:13] <tds5016> hey. can someone help me figure out how to send PUT data with JSON data to send across?
[17:21:12] <JP_> but I'm not sure how to init
[17:21:32] <duch_kazatel> yeah, so you init one and then change out the text when you show it.
[17:22:00] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/JDqLk/
[17:22:02] <tds5016> that's what I have.
[17:22:07] <tds5016> what I want to do is send JSON data
[17:22:41] <JP_> how do I do that?
[17:22:55] <duch_kazatel> i'm in the middle of something.,
[17:23:07] <JP_> ok
[17:23:07] <duch_kazatel> give me a few.
[17:24:51] <shoky> tds5016 http://jsfiddle.net/JDqLk/1/
[17:26:45] <duch_kazatel> shoky you should help out JP_ :)
[17:26:58] <shoky> heh
[17:27:22] <duch_kazatel> i won't have time to.
[17:28:49] <tds5016> shoky:  thanks!
[17:30:34] <JP_> Please :)
[17:32:49] <shoky> JP_ http://jsfiddle.net/XQf44/2/
[17:37:15] <JP_> shoky how do I make it so that the titles are clickable? Do I add this class="dialogBox"  id="dialog_1" etc
[17:37:51] <shoky> what do you mean.. titles are clickable?
[17:38:07] <shoky> you can click them ;p
[17:38:56] <JP_> Hmm.. only the read more  bit does not the  titles ie Service 1 etc
[17:39:10] <shoky> oh those titles
[17:39:18] <shoky> you add click handlers..
[17:41:53] <JP_> so type .on( "click", handler )  in the jquery  and give it a target class ?
[17:42:34] <groundup> Okay, I made a bunch of changes: http://jsfiddle.net/VANLh/2/ does that look better?
[17:42:41] <mitqueries> hey all, i can't get this script to work: http://jsfiddle.net/NF9D3/1/
[17:42:46] <mitqueries> obviously google.com is a standin
[17:43:18] <mitqueries> any ideas? this should be easy
[17:43:33] <shoky> JP_ http://jsfiddle.net/XQf44/3/
[17:43:48] <duch_kazatel> mitqueries what are you trying to do?
[17:44:12] <duch_kazatel> that should work.
[17:44:16] <mitqueries> get the response from the url using a GET request and add the data to the div duchkazatel
[17:44:20] <JP_> shoky Super thank you soo much for that :)
[17:44:22] <mitqueries> it's not :/
[17:44:32] <duch_kazatel> mitqueries it should work if the server allows it.
[17:44:57] <mitqueries> duch_kazatel: if the server is returning a 403 error wouldn't that hsow up?
[17:45:15] <mitqueries> that is to say, how do i see if its the server's fault
[17:45:22] <duch_kazatel> use a console
[17:45:40] <mitqueries> ?
[17:45:41] <groundup> $('#1').append(response);
[17:45:54] <mitqueries> yes groundup
[17:46:35] <shoky> mitqueries ajax is asynchronous, the success callback will be called much later than the line $('#l').append(response)
[17:46:48] <shoky> you need to put that append inside the callback
[17:47:07] <shoky> ?ajax101
[17:47:07] <b-ot> shoky: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:47:17] <mitqueries> shoky, i tried putting it inside $.get("url", function(data) { stuff } ); but it didn't work
[17:48:04] <shoky> mitqueries then use a console and browser devtools
[17:48:18] <shoky> preferably chrome if you want to know about cross-domain errors ;p
[17:48:43] <duch_kazatel> firebug tells you, it's just not as obvious.
[17:48:55] <shoky> where does it say it?
[17:48:56] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/UgSXnes.png
[17:49:58] <shoky> aren't those just response headers?
[17:50:25] <shoky> and if not, that's damn confusing
[17:51:23] <duch_kazatel> they are - but that should tell you if the remote server doesn't allow you to embed that content.
[17:52:10] <mitqueries> shoky: no errors are being returned
[17:52:56] <shoky> duch_kazatel yeah but you won't get those headers on many servers
[17:54:07] <duch_kazatel> i've found it to work whenever i need it to.
[17:54:08] <duch_kazatel> but meh
[17:54:36] <mitqueries> shoky: ok when i use document.write(data) it responds
[17:54:42] <mitqueries> sos it's not hte server duch_kazatel
[17:54:48] <duch_kazatel> kay
[17:55:04] <duch_kazatel> you said google was a stand in so it was hard to help
[17:55:19] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/QQB6Q/1/
[17:55:21] <shoky> duch_kazatel ^
[17:55:40] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[17:56:26] <duch_kazatel> i don't see the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header.
[17:57:08] <synth_> http://jsfiddle.net/K3jrj/ could someone explain to me why the child elements in this li are showing? shouldn't hiding the container li hide it's children?
[17:57:14] <mitqueries> shoky, duch_kazatel: ok i can get the response and write it to the console
[17:57:22] <mitqueries> it just won't append to my div!
[17:57:30] <shoky> duch oks didn't realize you meant that's the indicator
[17:57:50] <duch_kazatel> shoky yeah if the header isn't present, it's a no-go.
[17:58:08] <shoky> yea i know, just thought you meant there's a different way to see it
[17:58:09] <duch_kazatel> synth_ that's invalid markup./
[17:58:34] <duch_kazatel> synth_ http://jsfiddle.net/K3jrj/1/
[17:59:00] <duch_kazatel> shoky aaaah.  red means "broken", and yeah it's a bummer because you then have to know the header is missing.
[17:59:07] <duch_kazatel> not totally intuitive I'll agree, but it works for me.
[17:59:50] <duch_kazatel> synth_ once your markup is valid things work correctly.
[18:00:10] <shoky> ya i'll stop harassing you about it
[18:00:14] <synth_> duch_kazatel so how should a person correctly use http://fontawesome.io/icon/cog/ in an unordered list without affecting the base li styling?
[18:00:33] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.
[18:00:50] <duch_kazatel> you want the cog AND the LI?
[18:02:16] <duch_kazatel> synth_ if you just want to add the cog, <i class="fa fa-gear"></i>
[18:02:51] <duch_kazatel> like so: http://jsfiddle.net/K3jrj/2/
[18:03:05] <duch_kazatel> and with that i need to go.  enjoy folks.
[18:03:34] <synth_> bah he left
[18:04:28] <shoky> synth_ i didn't understand your issue
[18:05:49] <synth_> i guess i'm just going about this wrong. i have a global style for my li elements but when i add the fontawesome classes to my li elements, it destroys the font settings i have set up
[18:06:25] <shoky> that didn't clear things up.
[18:07:03] <synth_> shit, wait a second
[18:07:31] <synth_> ...this whole time i thought their examples were using <li> instead of <i>
[18:07:51] <shoky> that would've been unfortunate
[18:08:02] <synth_> yeah, now i gotta go change a bunch of my code around lol.
[18:09:59] <synth_> yeah switching <li> to <i> solved my issues. haha.
[18:10:03] * synth_ feels stupid.

[19:35:50] <micalexander> anybody else up for the challenge
[19:35:54] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/7pmba/2/
[19:35:57] <bowenac> so siblings works
[19:36:06] <bowenac> but it only works for the first
[19:36:15] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: my code should work
[19:36:21] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ micalexander
[19:36:22] <b-ot> micalexander: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:36:51] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: are you trying to trigger a click as if the user clicked on it?
[19:37:16] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: if you don't have a js click handler bound to that anchor tag when you trigger click, it will not do anything
[19:37:24] <micalexander> ryanneufeld: it seems like chrome console is even more useless than before ever since their update. the console just gives me <error> with a number to the left of it every time the div is clicked
[19:37:38] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: what is the error?
[19:39:11] <micalexander> clicking on the arrow next to the error gives me a lot of out put  https://gist.github.com/micalexander/146613c22b4cf9c8d3a0
[19:39:24] <ryanneufeld> ah, yeah
[19:43:58] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ffh3M/
[19:44:03] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: ^^
[19:46:06] <micalexander> That did it and now I need to know why...WHAT THE HELL WAS I DOING WRONG
[19:46:08] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ffh3M/ if you un-comment the code that I've commented out, you'll see the console.log but you'll notice that without that click handler. Nothing happens
[19:46:28] <micalexander> true
[19:46:33] <ryanneufeld> okay, so what happened here, is that when you triggered the click handler, the event bubbled up
[19:46:37] <micalexander> so whats the deal with that
[19:46:38] <ryanneufeld> so you had a click on the parent
[19:46:48] <ryanneufeld> then due to how browsers and jquery work
[19:47:32] <ryanneufeld> when you triggered the click on teh anchor tag
[19:47:54] <ryanneufeld> it was bubbled up an also triggered the click handler on the video-wrapper div
[19:47:58] <ryanneufeld> which then bubbled up to the media
[19:48:05] <ryanneufeld> which triggered the click handler you already had
[19:48:13] <ryanneufeld> and viola, you have an infinite loop
[19:48:35] <micalexander> so exactly what is bubbled up
[19:49:08] <micalexander> like all of them get clicked at the same time
[19:49:10] <ryanneufeld> the click event
[19:49:13] <ryanneufeld> no
[19:49:23] <ryanneufeld> it's more like they get clicked in order upwards to the parent
[19:50:11] <ryanneufeld> so what I did was check to see if the event target was the anchor tag, and if it was *not* then don't click
[19:50:24] <micalexander> so I think I saw something like this on stack. basically you excluded the "a" from being clicked
[19:50:31] <ryanneufeld> yes
[19:50:38] <ryanneufeld> effectively that's what I've done
[19:50:54] <ryanneufeld> since the assumption I've made is that the anchor already has it's own click handler
[19:51:10] <micalexander> gotcha, what that .is all about...is that jquery or javascript?
[19:51:22] <ryanneufeld> ?api is
[19:51:22] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[19:51:42] <micalexander> nice
[19:51:50] <micalexander> thanks
[19:51:53] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: check this out http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ffh3M/3/
[19:52:04] <ryanneufeld> or don't fine whatever
[19:52:07] <ryanneufeld> LEAVE!
[19:52:29] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: you're back!
[19:52:34] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: check this out http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ffh3M/3/
[19:52:43] <ryanneufeld> watch your console for an illustration of the loop
[19:52:54] <ryanneufeld> and you'll see what I was pointing at
[19:54:07] <ryanneufeld> micalexander: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ffh3M/5/ better example
[19:55:02] <TheAncientGoat> Hi guys, is there a way to disable data-cache? It's causing huge leaks in my angular chrome extension
[20:01:37] <ryanneufeld> TheAncientGoat: how do you mean? The browser will have it's own caching mech
[20:02:09] <ryanneufeld> TheAncientGoat: but if you're using $.ajax() you probably want to see ?api ajax
[20:03:00] <ryanneufeld> ?api jquery.ajax @TheAncientGoat
[20:03:00] <b-ot> TheAncientGoat: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:03:01] <TheAncientGoat> Dom caching it seems. Not as in for resources/scripts etc, but I have a ton of detatched dom nodes when switching between views in angular
[20:03:19] <kruug> I'm attempting to access the WUnderground API via json calls, but I'm not quite sure how to parse the result.  Is anyone familiar with nested json responses?
[20:03:57] <TheAncientGoat> ryanneufeld: I'm not actually using any direct jquery calls
[20:03:58] <ryanneufeld> TheAncientGoat: have you asked in #angularjs ?
[20:04:13] <ryanneufeld> you might have better luck over there
[20:04:22] <TheAncientGoat> I've been working with them for over a week trying to solve the issue
[20:04:31] <ryanneufeld> okay
[20:04:45] <ryanneufeld> I haven't a clue
[20:04:46] <ryanneufeld> so, yeah
[20:04:48] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[20:04:54] <TheAncientGoat> But I only realized now that jquery is one of the leak components (i've had a few)
[20:05:44] <ryanneufeld> I doubt very much that it's jquery leaking
[20:05:52] <ryanneufeld> more likely it's how you're using it that's causing the problem
[20:06:18] <ryanneufeld> DOM nodes aren't left in a detached state unless you put them there by calling detach afaik
[20:06:40] <TheAncientGoat> ryanneufeld: I'm not using jquery at all though, just indirectly through angular
[20:06:54] <ryanneufeld> then this is an angular bug
[20:07:21] <TheAncientGoat> and their jquery lite bindings are fine, but fullweight jquery leaks like mad
[20:07:34] <ryanneufeld> I dunno man
[20:07:39] <ryanneufeld> I don't know angular at all
[20:07:55] <ryanneufeld> I wish you luck good sir
[20:08:13] <TheAncientGoat> I think its complicated by  the fact that I'm working on a chrome extension that has a strange split frontend/background script arch
[20:08:23] <TheAncientGoat> ryanneufeld: Thanks.
[20:08:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that might even be a chrome bug :p
[20:09:38] <TheAncientGoat> ryanneufeld: Yep. I've tried to isolate if its chrome, pouchdb, bootstrap, angular, jquery, masonary... ah, the pitfalls of modularity
[20:13:43] <kruug> ryanneufeld: Would you be willing to assist with an API call that I'm trying to make?  And parsing/handling the returning data?
[20:15:47] <cadz> Hi anyone here?
[20:17:04] <cadz> Hi anyone here?
[20:20:45] <cadz> Anyone here?
[20:22:52] <TheAncientGoat> cadz: yes
[20:23:41] <cadz> TheAncientGoat:  Do you know any jquery plugin that i can use on monitoring an order? Basically the stages of an order, like a status bar?
[20:26:01] <TheAncientGoat> cadz: There are millions of jquery plugins
[20:26:39] <cadz> TheAncientGoat: please help me, I cant find anything that fits my needs. Ive been googling for hours now
[20:26:55] <gofishing> What are you looking for?
[20:27:06] <cadz> any jquery plugin that i can use on monitoring an order? Basically the stages of an order, like a status bar?
[20:27:39] <cadz> Do you understand what i need? or i need to post a picture?
[20:28:31] <TheAncientGoat> cadz: Well, you'll need to provide the tracking data somehow
[20:28:39] <TheAncientGoat> As in the progress of the order
[20:29:07] <cadz> TheAncientGoat: Yes, I can do that if only there's a plugin for that, or do I have to build it manually?
[20:29:50] <TheAncientGoat> You'll have to build the data provision code for that definitely.  Updating it visually using jquery is the easy part
[20:30:28] <cadz> TheAncientGoat: So you havent seen any plugin for that too? Building it manually seems to be the only way here.
[20:30:38] <gofishing> I understand.. why does it need to be javascript?
[20:30:44] <TheAncientGoat> I mean, if you want the whole thing, then you'd be looking into some kind of order tracking framework built with php or django or something
[20:31:03] <gofishing> Is the order in javascript?
[20:31:07] <cadz> gofishing: What can you suggest sir?
[20:31:22] <BillCriswell> cadz: I have no idea what you're asking for.
[20:31:37] <TheAncientGoat> Is it a client server application, or purely client side?
[20:31:40] <gofishing> Where do you get your data? A database?
[20:32:02] <cadz> gofishing: yes from database then it needs to be displayed in a status bar (the status of the order)
[20:32:37] <cadz> My first plan was just to  fetch the status from the DB then display it using normal JS, but i was instructed to find a plugin for this.
[20:33:15] <BillCriswell> Why would you need anything more than changing the text of an html element for this?
[20:33:58] <cadz> Okay, Ill go with my first plan then. Thanks a lot sirs
[20:34:01] <gofishing> Yes that is my point. You can just do it in html
[20:34:23] <gofishing> Status: shipped
[20:34:37] <gofishing> Status: in route
[20:35:18] <gofishing> And make a progress bar with destination points
