[00:01:27] * tw2113 meta descriptions some of his websites
[00:02:14] <coldhead> "the SEO consultant said we need to put this Word Doc in our meta description. with the images and the corporate logo"
[00:03:11] <tw2113> i'm keeping it sensible, but I'd like to possibly get more traffic to this domain
[00:04:04] <Whirl3d> also, sa2304, when you write a jquery plugin, you don't use $(this) in the main function because 'this' is already a jquery object
[00:06:33] <sa2304> thanks
[00:06:58] <Whirl3d> also, you want .each here
[00:07:43] <systemfault> I wish jquery would have a good and standard way of creating a plugin..
[00:08:09] <Whirl3d> there are several good standard ways.
[00:08:39] <coldhead> tw2113: just get linked to by mashable
[00:08:43] <systemfault> No, there's none… but whatever.
[00:08:44] <coldhead> and get yourself a beer
[00:09:05] <sa2304> like a some IDE?.. )
[00:09:13] <tw2113> ?
[00:09:24] <tw2113> ah
[00:09:24] <sa2304> >>  a good and standard way of creating a plugin..
[00:09:30] <tw2113> i was seeing "got" instead of "get"
[00:10:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/LRfsn/6/
[00:11:00] <Whirl3d> systemfault, sure there are. There's a github with all of them. Lemme look it up.
[00:14:23] <Whirl3d> systemfault, here is a really thorough explanation of the default way to write a plugin: http://stage.learn.jquery.com/plugins/a_plugin_development_pattern/
[00:15:07] <systemfault> Whirl3d: It's still the same old joke..
[00:15:33] <systemfault> Whirl3d: The same shitty and useless pattern that you can see in the authoring section on the main site
[00:15:43] <Whirl3d> it works
[00:15:49] <Whirl3d> I use it every day
[00:15:53] <systemfault> Only for ultra-simple plugins.
[00:16:04] <systemfault> It gives no way to deal with complexity.
[00:16:20] <systemfault> You call a function, you lose your "this" unless you .apply all the time.
[00:16:27] <tw2113> systemfault stop pining for a "unified" resource and go make one, propose the jQuery people link to it directly
[00:16:29] <systemfault> It's very… awfully bad
[00:16:36] <tw2113> :D
[00:17:08] <Whirl3d> sounds a little snobbish to me. but I don't know much , so...
[00:17:14] <systemfault> tw2113: Yeah :/
[00:17:56] <Whirl3d> i just wish someone would write a position: plugin that worked for everything
[00:18:01] <systemfault> Whirl3d: If you want to see a clean way to write a plugin, see the jquery ui widget factory
[00:44:53] <aro> is there a way to tell what invoked a click action?
[00:49:17] <aro> for some reason, i have a submit button, and when i click it, its binding (.on) is hit twice. If i set stopImmediatePropgation(), it is only invoked once. What gives?
[01:14:18] <sdepold> hi. is it correct, that i cannot use strict-mode for jquery plugins when i declare that mode inside a closure where jquery is passed to?
[01:14:34] <sdepold> like (function($){ $.fn.foo = function(){}  })(jQuery)
[01:15:01] <sdepold> it seems that $ is not passed by reference to a strict mode block
[01:15:08] <guy> how to I pass parameter to the callback function in this context?
[01:15:09] <guy> .animate([..], [..], callback)
[01:15:14] <guy> do*
[01:15:40] <sdepold> isn't it just .animate({ top: 20, left: 30 }, function(){}) ?
[01:16:06] <guy> right. It is recursive thing that calls itself.
[01:16:12] <sdepold> and function will be triggered once the animation is done
[01:16:35] <guy> true.
[01:16:39] <sdepold> sry i might have missed a part of the discussion
[01:16:58] <guy> not really. let me try to mock an examle.
[01:19:01] <sdepold> did anyone used strict mode in jquery plugins?
[01:19:38] <sdepold> (funny part is that the google closure compiler actually strips the "use strict" routine, so it's not strict mode anymore after minification
[01:22:07] <guy> https://gist.github.com/2e2639e47578dfeae554
[01:22:11] <guy> sdepold: to give an idea.
[01:23:09] <sdepold> what is .eq doing?
[01:26:03] <sdepold> ah i guess .eq will return a specific element of the found items right ?
[01:26:14] <sdepold> the code looks kinda ok-ish
[01:26:18] <sdepold> where is the prob?
[01:27:46] <guy> That's more acurate code.
[01:27:46] <guy> https://gist.github.com/668534c527b3ba918788
[01:27:50] <guy> accurate*
[01:30:17] <guy> https://gist.github.com/c6fe323f1cdbfe4cdcab
[01:31:06] <sdepold> i still don't know what the problem is
[01:31:47] <guy> ay.menu.elements.eq(--offset).animate({opacity: .1}, 2000-(ay.menu.elm_count-offset)*10, ay.menu.hide_last_elm(offset));
[01:32:13] <guy> the problem is the third argument. The callback. How do I pass parameters to it? Obviously this is wrong.
[01:32:55] <Whirl3d> why not just use this for your callback ($(ay.menu.elements.last().hide());
[01:33:14] <guy> Whirl3d: ?
[01:33:55] <Whirl3d> this is why we use jsfiddle. I'll be right back
[01:34:20] <guy> https://gist.github.com/5de27ab16e8355b717b4 uh. idiot. It was that simple.
[01:38:36] <Whirl3d> did you just call me an idiot because I was trying to help by setting up a fiddle for you. FUCK OFF
[01:39:19] <sdepold> just do function(){ay.menu.hide_last_elm(offset)}
[01:39:33] <sdepold> so u define a custom function which then calls the original one
[01:40:01] <guy> Whirl3d: ... ? what.
[01:40:09] <guy> I never called you an idiot.
[01:40:14] <sdepold> i guess he called himself an idiot
[01:40:29] <guy> It is pretty clear from the context.
[01:40:57] <sdepold> nevermind guys

[04:11:07] <nights> hi
[04:11:23] <nights> i want to update a div and fire a new ajax call on success on my ajax request
[04:11:35] <nights> for now both of them work, but not together
[04:13:02] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/KxUZs/
[04:13:05] <nights> im doing it like this
[04:13:17] <nights> unfortunately update only work if i remove the success part
[04:44:47] <Aha2Y> How can i make "$('button-1').append('');  });
[04:44:47] <Aha2Y> " append to a input with class input?
[04:47:08] <Bemmu> Aha2Y: not sure what you are wanting to do
[04:47:37] <Aha2Y> http://hackz.ch/dev/vkeyboard.php
[04:47:54] <Aha2Y> For example, If i click on a button it appends the char to the input box
[04:50:55] <Bemmu> $('input[name=input]').val($('input[name=input]').val() + 'x')
[04:52:12] <Aha2Y> ty
[04:55:50] <wavez> I'm trying to show a div using the click event of an anchor but it's not working for me. I'm referring to these demos but none use anchor tags, so something must be different about them.
[04:55:51] <wavez> http://api.jquery.com/show/
[04:57:13] <Bemmu> put what you are trying to do in a pastebin and I'll take a look
[04:57:26] <asher^> im guessing youre not preventing the default behaviour
[05:00:26] <fatninja> I have <div id="a"></div> , how to prepend the div with "X" , so I can get X<div id="a"></div>
[05:00:50] <BBJames> Hello #jquery
[05:01:26] <fatninja> .before()
[05:01:27] <fatninja> :D
[05:01:53] <Aha2Y> Bemmu: it did not work :< http://hackz.ch/dev/vkeyboard.php http://hackz.ch/js/keyboard.js
[05:03:00] <BBJames> I need to do two things, one on blur and a different one when a certain element is clicked(which will also cause on blur). is it possible to only do the click if that happens?
[05:03:18] <fatninja> any ideas how to make an asynchronous loop that sends ajax requests every 10 seconds ?
[05:06:19] <Bemmu> Aha2Y: At least you probably mean .button-1 and not button-1
[05:06:31] <Aha2Y> Yes i tried both.
[05:07:27] <wavez> this has my relevant code sections. I added the event.preventDefault(); but I don't see any change.
[05:07:28] <wavez> http://pastebin.com/rDYz2xNG
[05:07:36] <wavez> The bottom link is the one I'm testing right now.
[05:07:54] <wavez> the one with id="login"
[05:08:34] <wavez> oh wait, I see a problem
[05:08:53] <wavez> I'm not selecting login-box using class, I'm us id
[05:09:29] <Bemmu> Aha2Y: Are you using Chrome Developer tools btw? Very helpful
[05:10:02] <Aha2Y> Bemmu: http://pastebin.com/y3vs6AGh
[05:10:05] <Aha2Y> I have FireBug.
[05:10:27] <wavez> that isn't fixing it for me though
[05:10:41] <Bemmu> Aha2Y: Your $('input').val() is ambiguous because you have two inputs
[05:10:59] <Aha2Y> No look at the pastebin :P
[05:11:40] <Bemmu> $("button")click
[05:12:24] <Bemmu> dot missing at least
[05:12:29] <Nece228> hello i link my form to html file
[05:12:35] <Nece228> how to actually get the form data
[05:12:58] <Aha2Y> nope :<
[05:13:19] <sente> Nece228: read introductory material
[05:14:09] <Aha2Y>   $(".button-1")click($(".input").append("1"));
[05:14:28] <Nece228> sente: yeah i know i send forms to server
[05:15:23] <Bemmu> Aha2Y: before click
[05:15:30] <sente> yeah, and then you need something on the server to process the form data
[05:15:43] <Aha2Y> before click?
[05:15:47] * Aha2Y is confused now...
[05:16:19] <xec> Aha2Y: click() takes a function (handler) as parameter
[05:16:32] <BBJames> Hi guys, if someone could help me with this would be awesome. http://jsfiddle.net/2Quqc/
[05:18:39] <xec> Aha2Y: also you put the . in the wrong place, ".click(" not "click("
[05:19:48] <Aha2Y> xec: http://pastebin.com/k5UuDCt3 <- Like that?
[05:20:05] <Bemmu> And if you are using firebug, didn't it warn you about that missing dot?
[05:20:19] <xec> Aha2Y: depending on your markup, yes
[05:20:56] <Aha2Y> It still doesn't work :<
[05:21:05] <xec> Aha2Y: but it doesnt make much sense to append something to an input
[05:21:08] <xec> what are you trying to do
[05:21:18] <Aha2Y> http://hackz.ch/dev/vkeyboard.php
[05:22:42] <xec> Aha2Y: that doesn't explain much
[05:23:41] <BBJames> anyone :( ?
[05:24:02] <Aha2Y> Shit i closed my client :<
[05:24:12] <Aha2Y> xec: Did u saw the page i pasted?
[05:24:35] <xec> Aha2Y: yes
[05:24:58] <xec> Aha2Y: but it doesn't really explain what you're trying to do....
[05:25:21] <Aha2Y> I want when i click the button it appends a "1" to the input box
[05:27:30] <Aha2Y> Just for learning purpose.
[05:27:33] <xec> BBJames: i think maybe this code is a bit misguided - you want it to be a search box and a button that submits it?
[05:27:59] <xec> Aha2Y: then you can read the value using .val() and set it using .val("new content")
[05:28:04] <BBJames> What it will be is a search box that pops down with suggestions
[05:28:20] <Aha2Y> huh?
[05:28:26] <xec> hold on
[05:28:27] <BBJames> if a suggestion is clicked search for that, otherwise search for whats in the input on blur, xec
[05:29:35] <xec> Aha2Y: http://jsfiddle.net/tF869/
[05:29:51] <Aha2Y> lol
[05:29:54] <Aha2Y> ok
[05:30:04] <Aha2Y> So i can't use append?
[05:30:12] <Aha2Y> Because .val only adds it one time.
[05:30:28] <xec> one time?
[05:30:40] <xec> you can't append text to an input with .append() afaik
[05:31:04] <Aha2Y> Is there another way?
[05:31:38] <Aha2Y> To a textarea/label?
[05:31:39] <xec> BBJames: ok, the blur is always going to fire before the click if i'm not mistaken, so this approach isn't going to work unless you do something funky with setTimeout delay or something
[05:31:52] <xec> Aha2Y: what's wrong with the way i showed you?
[05:32:07] <Aha2Y> That it only adds the content one time,
[05:32:12] <Aha2Y> I want it multiple times
[05:32:13] <xec> Aha2Y: what?
[05:32:16] <rootty> hi all!
[05:32:24] <xec> Aha2Y: what makes you think that
[05:32:53] <xec> Aha2Y: clearly if you click the button multiple times you add more 1's to the input
[05:33:01] <Aha2Y> well
[05:33:09] <Aha2Y> http://hackz.ch/dev/vkeyboard.php <- Click two times it only adds one time.
[05:33:33] <xec> Aha2Y: did you see my jsfiddle?
[05:33:53] <xec> Aha2Y: do you see a difference between that and your implementation?
[05:33:59] <Aha2Y> sorry my bad
[05:34:00] <Aha2Y> ty
[05:35:45] <BBJames> I was thinking maybe theres a way to say, if on blur was a click on x then don't do anything.
[05:37:03] <Aha2Y> Xec, One thing http://jsfiddle.net/tF869/2/ <- it also edits the button value ._.
[05:37:52] <xec> BBJames: not that i know of, seeing as they are not the same event you can't prevent the other that easily (without timeout trickery for instance). if you're looking for a autocomplete though, there are a lot of readymade plugins already
[05:38:33] <xec> Aha2Y: yes, because your button is also an input
[05:39:11] <xec> Aha2Y: my example was contrived, you will need to select the input properly. in your case it looks like you've given it a class, so select on that instead?
[05:39:13] <Aha2Y> got it ty
[05:39:15] <Aha2Y> :D
[05:39:20] <Aha2Y> it works perfect xec.
[05:41:29] <BBJames> hmm.
[05:42:52] <rootty> I am writing an phonegap app with jquerymobile. But  I can't debug my ajax requests in Firebug(XmlHttpRequest errorm or smth.) , but in WP7 emulator it works. I set $.support.cors and $.mobile.allowCrossDomainPages to true, but it doesn't helps
[05:43:15] <xec> BBJames: but i think this may be a case of you trying to do X and thought of solution Y so you're asking about Y when there is a better way of doing X
[05:43:32] <rootty> any solutions how to debug jquery.ajax from file://.../myjs.js?
[05:43:58] <BBJames> Well dec, I have already completed it apart form this one problem, so i don't fancy going over it again with the plugin
[05:44:22] <BBJames> it works at the moment (sort of) but I have 2 ajax events that fire (which isn't ideal)
[05:44:27] <BBJames> xec*
[05:45:26] <xec> rootty: iirc you can send ajax requests to local files
[05:45:52] <rootty> xec, iirc ?
[05:46:00] <xec> if i remember correctly
[05:46:04] <xec> i recall doing that in firefox anyway
[05:47:32] <nmee> Hi guys, how come the .tmpl() plugin was discontinued, and what is the general recommendation to use instead?
[05:47:59] <rootty> xec, i trying to comunicate with webservice on the server from local file. And it doesn't work. I read that the reason is sandboxing of browsers.
[05:48:51] <rootty> but if i upload app to the phone, it works
[05:49:05] <xec> rootty: yes, correct - what part are you trying to debug? your code or the webservice?
[05:49:17] <rootty> my code
[05:49:26] <rootty> specially jquery.ajax request
[05:49:42] <rootty> it completly not working in my desktop browser
[05:49:48] <xec> rootty: then you can use a local file with some dummy data and send ajax requests to that instead
[05:51:39] <rootty> xec, good trick, but I am participating in internship and the webservice isn't my. I think I couldn't reproduce it.
[05:52:46] <xec> well, you wouldnt need to reproduce the entire service, just the response results
[05:55:04] <rootty> but than, how I'll test my jquery.ajax code? As far as I understand you, you mean to call another "fake" function instead of $.ajax ?
[05:56:01] <Aha2Y> How can i make a \ in jQuery?
[05:56:07] <Aha2Y> \ seems to break out of ""
[05:57:02] <xec> rootty: no you use the standard $.ajax() but point to a local file that has some fake data in the same format you would expect from the webservice
[05:58:08] <xec> Aha2Y: maybe escape it? but i doubt this has anything to do with jQuery - you need to learn javascript before jquery
[05:58:22] <rootty> xec, oh..
[05:58:26] <rootty> ok
[05:59:08] <BBJames> dec timeout seems to work reasonably well so thanks.

[06:06:06] <xec> LucaS05: jsperf.com is nice for comparing two small bits of code, but if you want to find bottlenecks you could take a look at YSlow or google pagespeed

[06:34:44] <xec> mydog2: ok¨
[06:35:28] <xec> mydog2: thats fine, what happens if you now do: aa("test");
[06:35:45] <yanick_> xec, the problem with the slider solution that you provided is that when I trigger the slide event, I don't get the ui argument to receive values. I can go around this by fetching the widget's slider values, but I think it's a dirty hack....
[06:35:46] <mydog2> xec,  - on the far right side of the insert line.. i see the triangle in the red square
[06:36:10] <xec> mydog2: yes clicking that gives you a multiline input
[06:36:15] <yanick_> xec, $('#slider').trigger('slider'); should trigger the slider event and have ui receive the correct value at all times
[06:36:53] <xec> yanick_: yeah i was thinking about that earlier, dunno if you can do that tbh
[06:37:11] <yanick_> xec, I guess it's a jQuery UI limitation
[06:37:14] <yanick_> ... but a dumb one
[06:37:43] <mydog2> xec,  - ok.. the test worked...
[06:37:44] <xec> yanick_: well, like you say you can retrieve it yourself
[06:38:03] <yanick_> xec, yes, I'll have to do it...
[06:38:30] <xec> yanick_: but there may be an easier way, why are you manually triggering the event?
[06:38:40] <mydog2> xec,  - another question.. if i load a test url.. and i go in firebug.. can i create test jscript that would manipulate the DOM/xpath?
[06:39:04] <xec> mydog2: i'm not sure i understand the question
[06:39:05] <mydog2> i'm starting to investigate phantomjs.. and i'm trying to see what dev/debug tools are available..
[06:39:10] <yanick_> xec, I want to update a label on the slider creation. it's not much, I could just hardcode it, but i'd like to have it all concise to the slider creation
[06:39:33] <yanick_> xec, since all the code *is* in the slider event, I wanted to simply call that event on creation
[06:39:37] <yanick_> but ui is undefined :(
[06:39:51] <Aha2Y> xec: http://hackz.ch/dev/vkeyboard.php :P
[06:40:01] <xec> yanick_: isn't it easier to do it the other way round?
[06:40:20] <xec> yanick_: if i understand correctly you're doing something on slider load?
[06:41:17] <xec> yanick_: what if you listen to the slidecreate event and do that stuff then
[06:41:29] <yanick_> xec, like I said, since all the code is in the slide event, I wanted to trigger that even to update on creation. Other than that, the other option is to have an external function that the slide event calls and I ignore ui, and refetch the slider in that function; which funciton I can call whenever I want to update the label
[06:41:48] <yanick_> xec, becuse the create event's ui arg is undefined
[06:41:51] <yanick_> anyway
[06:42:14] <xec> yanick_: it will be defined when the slider itself is triggering it
[06:42:42] <yanick_> xec, no, it is not. Anyway. doesn't matter. I'll have a generic function...
[06:43:41] <mydog2> xec - when you access the dom of a page..  do you use xpath.. or the selectors?
[06:44:46] <xec> mydog2: xpath is for XML, you would use DOM manipulation?
[06:45:11] <mydog2> xec, - xpath works on html as well..
[06:45:44] <mydog2> xec,  - i'm doing some web scraping. and looking into various tools
[06:53:12] <bartmax> hi
[06:53:13] <bartmax> anyone ?
[06:53:29] <BBJames> Is there a simple way to get the next select after the current select, with x container
[06:54:03] <BBJames> sometimes there is a validation div in the middle so next(select) doesn't work.
[06:54:15] <bartmax> ? next
[06:54:15] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[06:54:19] <xec> BBJames: in a css selector you could use the + next sibling selector
[06:54:22] <bartmax> :)
[06:56:00] <xec> but that could match multiple elements, depending on markup - what you want is probably .next()
[06:56:04] <bartmax> you have <div><select/></div><div><select/></div> ?
[06:56:52] <BBJames> I have <div><select/><div>select x is require</div><select/><select/></div>
[06:57:27] <bartmax> you can use next('select') should work with no problems ?
[06:57:36] <BBJames> bartmax it doesn't work
[06:57:41] <bartmax> fiddle pls.
[06:57:47] <bartmax> and yes there's a way.
[06:57:48] <bartmax> ;)
[06:57:59] <bartmax> if the selects are not siblings...
[06:58:01] <BBJames> it works when there is no validation in-between, wil fiddle now
[06:58:08] <bartmax> thats weird
[06:58:41] <bartmax> ? nextAll
[06:58:41] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[06:58:51] <bartmax> ? nextUntil
[06:58:51] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[07:00:04] <bartmax> maybe you need to do something like: .nextAll(selector:first)
[07:00:33] <bartmax> maybe you need to do something like: .nextAll('select:first')
[07:02:33] <BBJames> Thanks, heres that fiddle you asked for http://jsfiddle.net/NegJZ/
[07:03:10] <bartmax> tryied nextall already ?
[07:04:17] <xec> looks like it works, bartmax, BBJames, http://jsfiddle.net/dETh3/
[07:05:17] <BBJames> sorry my original had a couple errors,
[07:05:18] <BBJames> http://jsfiddle.net/NegJZ/2/
[07:05:22] <BBJames> I will try that now xec
[07:05:28] <BBJames> sorry *sex
[07:05:31] <bartmax> sorry phone
[07:05:40] <xec> :D
[07:06:36] <sanam> hello every one
[07:06:56] <sanam> I have a link for editing any news
[07:06:57] <BBJames> perfect, http://jsfiddle.net/NegJZ/3/ thanks dec and bartmax
[07:07:01] <BBJames> xec*
[07:07:04] <xec> rofl
[07:07:14] <sanam> I just want to edit my news content using jquery lightbox
[07:07:23] <sanam> does any one can help me?
[07:07:23] <bartmax> glad could help.... :)
[07:07:28] <bartmax> how are you xec ?
[07:07:38] <bartmax> ? ask @sanam
[07:07:44] <bartmax> bah
[07:07:47] <bartmax> ? ask
[07:07:53] <bartmax> boooot ?
[07:07:59] <xec> i am wildly entertained! :D
[07:08:04] <bartmax> ;(
[07:08:09] <xec> ?ask @ sanam
[07:08:14] <xec> nooo fail
[07:08:14] <bartmax> ha!
[07:08:19] <bartmax> no we are two :D
[07:08:21] <bartmax> now
[07:08:26] <xec> rofl
[07:09:01] <xec> sanam: just state your question :)
[07:09:22] <bartmax> who's sentence is this? it's javascript sentence., who's javascript sentence is this? it's bot. who's bot? bot is dead baby... boy is dead.
[07:09:56] * bartmax tries to resurrect bot with no luck
[07:09:59] <xec> thin, mate - thin.
[07:10:13] <bartmax> thin ?
[07:10:29] <bartmax> oh no! sanam pm me :D
[07:10:38] <sanam> xec: I need to edit something by PHP using forms displayed in a jquery lightbox
[07:10:40] <xec> maybe if you did "it's not a sentence, it's javascript"
[07:10:57] <bartmax> well ...
[07:11:04] <bartmax> that would be much better
[07:11:51] <bartmax> but just for the fact im trying to say the bot is dead, i think i could get a +1 for effort on creativity on saturday 11:11 am
[07:11:59] <xec> sanam: awesome. what is your question? :)
[07:12:13] <bartmax> rolf
[07:12:27] <bartmax> saturdays are funny
[07:12:56] <sanam> xec: how can I display a result of select query from php in a jquery lightbox
[07:13:21] <xec> sanam: what do you mean by "a select query"?
[07:13:27] <bartmax> mysql pretty sure
[07:13:41] <sanam> for example: select * from news where id=3;
[07:13:45] <bartmax> ;)
[07:13:59] <xec> yeah, i'm just trying to make sure he knows this is #jquery, not #php or #mysql
[07:14:16] <sanam> data of each column should be place in form fields,
[07:14:28] <sanam> and the form should be display in jquery lightbox
[07:14:37] <sanam> or a dialog box
[07:14:40] <xec> it seems my attempt failed miserably
[07:15:04] <xec> sanam: do you have a url that returns the data you want?
[07:15:17] <bartmax> yup... let me try. sanam you do it normaly in HTML, display right on the page. when you get the data there, wrap into a div with a class lightbox and call from javascript lightbox on that class
[07:16:55] <sanam> yes, I have a URL <a href="edit.php?id=3">Edit</a>
[07:17:00] <sanam> as an example,
[07:17:26] <sanam> I have selected all news from my news table and displayed in a table,
[07:17:35] <sanam> each record has edit link
[07:18:09] <sanam> now I need to click on edit and a lightbox should be opened to edit the news with the id which I have in my link
[07:18:09] <xec> sanam: do you have multiple things on the same page that you want to be able to edit with the same lightbox form?
[07:19:20] <sanam> I have 10 rows from my news table
[07:19:27] <sanam> and each row has the edit link
[07:19:48] <sanam> and the purpose of this link is to edit the specific news
[07:19:59] <sanam> and it has to be edited via a lightbox
[07:20:45] <xec> ok, in that case you will probably want to load the contents from the edit.php into the lightbox, right?
[07:20:51] <bartmax> hey xec, do you preffer prototype revelein module o just reveleing module pattern ?
[07:20:56] <sanam> Yes
[07:21:03] <sayakb> i'm have this link on a user forum that lets the users preview a topic by hovering on a "preview" link for 1 second (it opens a modal after that). within that one second, i want something like a pie chart to fill up (something like a circle filling up clockwise). anyone has an idea how i can achieve that?
[07:21:36] <xec> sanam: then you want to look at this: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:21:56] <sanam> but we can use some Ajax techniques to do this
[07:22:07] <xec> .load() does use ajax, yes
[07:22:20] <bartmax> sayakb: get a animated png or gif with that animation and then just use it on hover
[07:22:43] <xec> sanam: essentially it lets you get html from a page, select the part you want, and insert it where you want
[07:22:54] <sayakb> bartmax: sure, just wanted to have fun with a bit of html5 + jquery :)
[07:23:33] <sanam> I need to put my all retrieved data in form fields to be able to edit my record
[07:23:43] <bartmax> sayakb: ok. there are lot of plugins for chart in canvas and svg... google for em then
[07:24:00] <sanam> there is one thing which confused me,
[07:24:05] <sayakb> bartmax: thanks
[07:24:16] <xec> sayakb: if you want fancy shapes and stuff you probably don't want jquery, maybe look at http://raphaeljs.com/
[07:24:21] <sanam> how can I extract when I loaded my data from my php file
[07:24:32] <xec> sanam: read the link i gave you
[07:24:45] <bartmax> sanam: you make the php return that data in an html form fashion
[07:25:46] <qp^> */join #wordpress
[07:25:50] <qp^> fbfgu damn sry¨
[07:25:57] <xec> bartmax: i totally didn't understand your question, what on earth is revelein?
[07:26:11] <bartmax> xec bad english.. hold on
[07:26:34] <sayakb> xec: thanks, looks useful indeed
[07:26:38] <bartmax> revealing module pattern vs prototype revealing module pattern
[07:26:44] <qp^> brauchst du deutsch ;D

[07:32:29] <qp^> good bye seo ;D
[07:33:33] <xec> bartmax: i think i already answered you, though ;)
[07:33:46] <bartmax> ????
[07:34:10] <xec> if i have no clue what you're on about i obviously do not have a preference ;)
[07:34:20] <xec> tbh i'm a huge fan of avoiding over-engineering
[07:34:29] <sanam> xec:thank you
[07:34:40] <sanam> but only problem has been left,
[07:34:57] <sanam> that how can I put each column data in a form field,
[07:35:00] <bartmax> xec i see
[07:35:01] <anli_> Can I make a table use 100% of its surrounding divs width?
[07:35:22] <bartmax> anli_: mmm width:100% ?
[07:35:27] <anli_> Tried that
[07:35:29] <bartmax> anli_: i guess that doesnt work.
[07:35:32] <anli_> Got bigger
[07:35:35] <xec> sanam: you would do that serverside with php? your edit.php should return a form that is filled out
[07:35:41] <bartmax> anli_: can u fiddle ?
[07:35:49] <anli_> I also tried to set the width of a table using px instead of %
[07:35:55] <anli_> Seems that it is not respected
[07:36:00] <anli_> Its too much to put in a pastebin
[07:36:03] <sanam> xec: Oh, Thank you so much,
[07:36:09] <sanam> I get it,
[07:36:46] <xec> anli_: a div and a table is too much for a pastebin?
[07:37:51] <anli_> No, but its not only a div and a table
[07:38:26] <xec> anli_: that is all the information you have given us so far, and expect us to know what the problem is
[07:38:46] <xec> anli_: in any case this is a #css issue
[07:44:48] <ner0x> Anyone familiar with jQuery dataTables ?
[07:45:10] <bartmax> ner0x: used a little... got lot of trouble.
[07:45:14] <bartmax> but are amazing
[07:45:19] <bartmax> if you stick to what they are :D
[07:45:31] <bartmax> *my personal experience*
[07:45:48] <ner0x> I'm trying to redraw a table in which I don't have the original return value for .dataTable();   is there a way to call the object and use fnDraw() ?
[07:46:43] <bartmax> ner0x: cant be able to help you tho ... used too little...
[07:54:04] <ner0x> No biggie. I'll just refresh the page. lol
[07:58:32] <magentar> is it normal that $.browser.msie returns "undefined" instead of false?
[08:00:16] <mydog2> xec, - still here?
[08:00:48] * xec hides behind some shrubbery
[08:04:36] <zozo> hi
[08:04:43] <zozo> how are you ?
[08:08:11] <mydog2> xec --- got some basic test js.. when running a js file.. does the js logic get processed starting at the top of the file.. to the end, top down so to speak?
[08:08:25] <mydog2> with the exception of functions obviously..
[08:09:10] <timini> $('#target') returns an array with one element in, is there anyway to just get the element without doing $('#target')[0] ?
[08:09:10] <xec> yes, javascript is top-down processed
[08:12:46] <pflock> I have a php file which gives me an image based on the POST variables. How do I use the code which the php file returns and make an image out of it?
[08:13:03] <xec> mydog2: functions are no exception, you would need to define a function before it is called
[08:14:44] <MrSaints> pflock: when you use jQuery's ajax function (which is essentially what $.post is), the data from the ajax source is returned and you can use this with any dom insertion function (e.g. append).
[08:15:28] <pflock> MrSaints: Thats what I've done. I used $.post and tried to append it but it doesn't work somehow..
[08:15:48] <MrSaints> pflock: if you can provide me a jsfiddle of your source perhaps I can help you better
[08:15:49] <xec> what exactly does the php file return
[08:18:18] <pflock> I am getting Object PNG [...] has no method appendTo
[08:20:28] <xec> pflock: maybe you can do something like this http://blog.team-noir.net/2010/03/how-to-use-images-base64-encoded-inline-an-img-tag/
[08:21:48] <pflock> thanks, I'll try that
[08:21:58] <xec> but to be honest, i think it would be much more straight-forward to just use GET instead of POST, insert an image element with the url+params and let the browser handle the http for you
[08:22:11] <Eviltwin> Absolutely
[08:22:25] <MrSaints> pflock: I would avoid inlining images, especially if they are huge
[08:23:45] <MrSaints> The latter method is preferrable and once again, if you can put up a fiddle of your js perhaps we can help you better
[08:32:37] <anli_> In ie, I can choose another browser version and see what my webpage will look as using that version, however, there are two settings, what is the name of those two settings in english?
[08:32:51] <anli_> Not just only one setting
[08:35:15] <anli_> Is there a reason why I want to change browser mode but not document mode+
[08:37:44] <MrSaints> anli_: are you asking about the difference between browser and document mode?
[08:40:05] <anli_> I found out that "browser mode" is used as an incorrect name for "user agent"
[08:40:13] <anli_> But you are right, I was asking about that
[08:40:40] <anli_> Maybe I was a bit hasty asking
[08:40:41] <MrSaints> Ah right. Yea, browser mode basically changes the user agent and version string. Useful if you want to test stuff out
[08:41:21] <anli_> Yeah, would not hurt if they called it "user agent", I had to waste a minute googling :)
[08:43:17] <anli_> Has IE usage gone from 20.1% to 18.3% just in 3 months?
[08:43:22] <anli_> wow
[08:43:28] <anli_> http://w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_explorer.asp
[08:44:54] <MrSaints> Interesting. Might be partially due to the fact it has been banned in Germany lol
[08:45:36] <anli_> But its still unreal
[08:45:38] <anli_> :)
[08:45:41] <anli_> Banned???
[08:45:49] <anli_> How can a browser be banned
[08:46:10] <anli_> I understood if you said Vatican instead of Germany
[08:46:52] <MrSaints> Issues with Motorola and patents
[08:47:23] <MrSaints> Not sure if the verdict has been enforced yet, but if so, that would mean byebye to W7 and Xbox as well.
[08:47:25] <anli_> How is Motorola and IE related? :)
[08:47:42] <anli_> O boy, how stupid people are
[08:47:45] <anli_> :)
[08:47:53] <MrSaints> Check the news
[08:47:54] <anli_> Can I continue using mIRC?
[08:48:00] <MrSaints> Pretty weird
[08:48:01] <anli_> At least if I change the font
[08:48:05] <anli_> yeah
[08:55:37] <Mekzholan> I've just read, that .append() will move (and not clone) when used with an existing DOM element. So I've got two questiongs about that:
[08:55:37] <Mekzholan> 1. How could I change that to do a copy (= clone) instead of moving it?
[08:55:37] <Mekzholan> 2. What's faster and better on the resources (think of mobile): cloning or recreating that DOM element (the DOM element here is simple, it' just text or an <img>)?
[08:56:57] <ajpiano> Mekzholan: use .clone(
[08:56:59] <ajpiano> ?cloe
[08:57:03] <ajpiano> ?clone
[08:57:04] <caniuse> ajpiano: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[08:57:07] <N0VA> hi everyone, i have a list of array's and i get the ID of an element and want to use that ID to target the right Array but i can't get it to work yet. http://jsfiddle.net/ca9f4/
[08:57:17] <ajpiano> 2. benchmark : http://jsperf.com
[08:57:22] <Mekzholan> ajpiano: thanks, that answers 1. :)
[08:59:05] <Mekzholan> ajpiano: that'll show me the used CPU. But what about other ressources like RAM?
[08:59:20] <Mekzholan> is there a theoretical answer as well?
[09:00:34] <N0VA> i do get the ID (when i test an alert with the var) but can't get anything out of the array i try to target with the name
[09:01:16] <N0VA> woops ❯ http://jsfiddle.net/ca9f4/1/ thats the right version
[09:01:58] <ajpiano> Mekzholan: oh i thought you said perform
[09:02:09] <ajpiano> i don't know if't possible to figure that out, the cpu/ram impact
[09:02:36] <ajpiano> Mekzholan: but best of luck if you can ;) im out!
[09:02:50] <N0VA> darn '' around the $c, returns ❯ $cfacebook (but with $clr[0] i get ❯ $)

[09:07:45] <paulk-desktop> hi
[09:08:48] <paulk-desktop> I want to show some animation when the user clicks on a link and when it's done, get to the page, but not before
[09:09:37] <N0VA> paulk-desktop: http://api.jquery.com/animate/ go down to Basic Usage, see the // Animation complete. part? thats where you can do whatever you want when its done
[09:09:50] <paulk-desktop> anything better than returning false to the onclick function and then use a callback to a javascript function that will redirect to the page?
[09:11:13] <paulk-desktop> I basically don't want to use
[09:11:14] <paulk-desktop> window.location
[09:11:18] <paulk-desktop> window.location.href, etc
[09:11:27] <N0VA> dont think there is any other way, that or fake a click
[09:11:40] <paulk-desktop> alright
[09:11:49] <N0VA> $('#topsecretlinktosendyouawaytoadifferentsite').click();
[09:13:21] <BBJames> Hi, can't I do array[] = newvalue; in jQuery?
[09:13:44] <N0VA> BBJames: var something = ['abc','123']; i believe
[09:13:53] <N0VA> var is optional
[09:14:06] <BBJames> I want to do an each then on each iteration add a new value
[09:14:14] <N0VA> http://jsfiddle.net/ca9f4/2/ it takes the name and all but as a result i get the first letter of the array it is suppose to target
[09:14:16] <Famic> BBJames: myarray.push('newvalue')
[09:14:31] <BBJames> ok thanks Famic
[09:14:40] <N0VA> all i want to do is target a Array based on a ID i get (and set to var)
[09:19:34] <Famic> N0VA: you'd probably be better off with $C['facebook']
[09:20:01] <N0VA> What?
[09:20:32] <N0VA> each network = 2 colors, would that still work
[09:20:58] <Famic> sure, you can store arrays in an array
[09:21:11] <N0VA> oh perfect :)
[09:21:51] <N0VA> how exactly would that look?
[09:23:49] <Famic> $C['facebook'] = ['#012241','#1fb8f2'];
[09:24:14] <N0VA> is there a way to make it one line? so $C = [facebook['012241','1fb8f2'], youtube	= ['5e1616','fb9393']];
[09:24:20] <N0VA> ah
[09:24:37] <Famic> you may need a $C = [] before you van set a specific index
[09:24:57] <Famic> maybe an object would be better than an array too
[09:25:27] <Famic> $C = { "facebook": ['#012241','#1fb8f2'], "youtube": ['#012241','#1fb8f2'] }
[09:25:41] <Famic> then $C.facebook
[09:26:52] <N0VA> thanks, but i'm still left with the problem my var to get the info is turning into text
[09:27:06] <N0VA> $clr = '$C.' + $(this).find('div').eq(0).attr('id'); gives me $C.youtube for example
[09:28:01] <Famic> you could always use eval(), but make sure you know what yo'ure doing, because as we say "eval is evil"
[09:28:49] <Famic> I guess I shouldn't even name it
[09:28:57] <N0VA> :|
[09:28:58] <Famic> stick with the array
[09:29:48] <N0VA> ok
[09:32:08] <N0VA> its getting close Famic
[09:32:17] <N0VA> console.log($C['facebook'][0]); shows the right info
[09:32:49] <N0VA> but $clr = '$C["' + $(this).find('div').eq(0).attr('id') + '"]'; makes the same but using it gives me $ as a result
[09:34:31] <Famic> $C shouldn't be in quites
[09:34:36] <Famic> *quotes
[09:35:11] <Famic> $(this).find('.widgetSq').css('box-shadow','inset 0 2px 1px -1px' + $C[$(this).find('div').eq(0).attr('id')]);
[09:35:56] <Famic> $(this).find('.widgetSq').css('box-shadow','inset 0 2px 1px -1px' + $C[$(this).find('div').eq(0).attr('id')][0]);
[09:36:39] <Famic> also you don't need .eq(0) when you want the first one
[09:36:52] <sean`> lol
[09:36:54] <sean`> wth
[09:37:00] <N0VA> ah :x
[09:38:43] <N0VA> got it, thanks a lot Famic!
[09:39:20] <Famic> yw
[09:40:44] <N0VA> step one was to make it work, so now to make it more efficient :) and the least amount of characters
[09:41:33] <Famic> it's good practice to do something like var $this = $(this) at the beginning of the .each() function
[09:41:58] <Famic> on a global note, don't ask jquery to find the same objects again and again, just store a reference to them
[09:43:52] <Arist_> how can i remove data from dialog box when i close or edit it ? thanks.
[09:48:48] <Mekzholan1> ajpiano: the test is now at http://jsperf.com/jquery-clone-or-recreate
[09:59:57] <mydog2> hey xec -- mind if i ask another question??
[10:00:24] <mydog2>  can this be made to work.. ie xpath in a queryselector??  >>   document.querySelectorAll("select[contains(@id,'CLASS_SRCH_WRK2_INSTITUTION$46$')]");
[10:00:55] <mydog2> the xpath is valid, in that i fire up firepath.. insert the xpath. get the node.
[10:05:33] <Cork> al3xa: ?
[10:05:49] <Cork> al3xa: any reason your trying to send me files?
[10:06:09] <al3xa> nah, it's just me being dumb with IRC client(s)
[10:06:30] <Cork> al3xa: try #freenode
[10:06:43] <al3xa> Cork, thx
[10:06:46] <Cork> np
[10:08:17] <xec> mydog2: afaik querySelectorAll is for css selector
[10:09:05] <xec> mydog2: what are you trying to match?
[10:17:03] <Guest13010> anyone here familiar with jCarousel?
[10:17:35] <Guest13010> ill paypal you 20 bucks if you can solve an issue :)
[10:17:51] <xec> Guest13010: whether they are or not, they won't be able to help without a proper question, just state your question and maybe someone can answer
[10:25:35] <Lyfesaver> I am trying to slim down my jquery ui, as I got everything at first, not knowing what I would need by the time the site was done. If i am using just accordion, dialog and datepicker, do I need all 4 of the items in the core section?
[10:25:44] <Lyfesaver> core, widget, mouse and position are the 4
[10:28:10] <xec> Lyfesaver: not mouse, apparently. just go to http://jqueryui.com/download click deselect all components and then check the ones you want
[10:28:16] <xec> dependencies get checked for you
[10:28:25] <Lyfesaver> ohhh
[10:28:28] <Lyfesaver> good tip
[10:28:29] <Lyfesaver> tyvm
[10:30:24] <Lyfesaver> ya xec... i discoved that i disable jquery ui in the header..... all 700+ times on the page load in less than half a second
[10:30:37] <Lyfesaver> with jquery ui loaded, well u saw the results
[10:30:42] <Lyfesaver> sometime more than 7 seconds
[10:30:56] <Lyfesaver> so i am hoping slimming it down will help
[10:31:13] <xec> it won't
[10:31:24] <Lyfesaver> well that is two ppl that have told me that =)
[10:31:25] <Lyfesaver> lol
[10:31:32] <xec> you're not struggling with download time, you are struggling with execution time
[10:31:45] <Lyfesaver> ahhhh very good point
[10:31:49] <Lyfesaver> very good point
[10:31:55] <Lyfesaver> shucks
[10:31:57] <Lyfesaver> lol
[10:32:52] <Lyfesaver> i am going on 96 hours on this one issue
[10:33:02] <Lyfesaver> i am going to end up in a looney bend
[10:33:08] <Lyfesaver> or breaking my PC
[10:33:13] <Lyfesaver> whichever comes first =)
[10:34:06] <Lyfesaver> i just dont know what to do
[10:34:18] <Lyfesaver> i got ppl telling me "it cant be done"
[10:34:31] <Lyfesaver> which i believe that "I" might not be able to do it
[10:34:35] <xec> Lyfesaver: we can't really help you at all if you don't have a specific question, what is "it"
[10:34:36] <Lyfesaver> but i cant believe that it cant be done
[10:34:47] <vivekm> IN the code @ http://jsfiddle.net/9hMhD/ Can someone tell why 'HEADER_REQUEST_TYPE' global variable is not replaced while REQUEST_PUT_MESSAGE is replaced correctly (in ajax headers)
[10:35:40] <xec> vivekm: do you know what a "map" or "object literal" is in javascript?
[10:35:42] <Lyfesaver> "it" is the loading of 700+ movies and it taking FOREVER, i am sorry xec, i thot u remembered me and the issue i was having
[10:35:44] <Lyfesaver> 2ndly
[10:35:45] <Lyfesaver> sry
[10:35:51] <Lyfesaver> but i was not asking for help
[10:35:56] <Lyfesaver> just more venting than anything
[10:36:00] <Lyfesaver> but i will shut up now
[10:36:03] <xec> ;)
[10:36:48] <vivekm> xec: i keep forgetting js. i rarely work on it.
[10:36:51] <xec> Lyfesaver: if it makes you feel better, it's frustrating to see people struggle without beeing able to help as well ;)
[10:37:05] <Lyfesaver> lol ya I know what u mean bro =)
[10:37:10] <xec> vivekm: well, jQuery is javascript, and this is one of the very basic things you need to know
[10:37:31] <vivekm> xec: tx, dude!
[10:37:41] <Lyfesaver> well Xec, i think u gave me some tips last night, but they were beyond my skillset =(
[10:37:50] <Lyfesaver> and the guy who wrote the webapp that i am skiining
[10:37:59] <xec> vivekm: from the snippet you posted it looks like you have the headers syntax mixed up
[10:38:04] <Lyfesaver> is insisting that what I am trying to do can not, under any circumstances
[10:38:08] <Lyfesaver> be done without AJAX
[10:39:25] <Lyfesaver> I was told that the razor @ calls are all run at load time and can not be places in a JS to be run at script load time... would you say that is correct xec?
[10:40:15] <xec> Lyfesaver: if by "@ calls" you mean server side C# code, then yes - they are evaluated server-side
[10:40:26] <Lyfesaver> ya thats what i meant
[10:40:40] <xec> Lyfesaver: but their result can be passed to javascript relatively easily
[10:41:02] <Lyfesaver> but i would still need to fetch those results for all 700 at page load, yes?
[10:41:12] <Lyfesaver> and store them later for use in JS
[10:41:14] <Lyfesaver> right?
[10:41:24] <shoky> hy
[10:41:30] <Lyfesaver> hy shoky
[10:41:59] <shoky> are you showing all 700 at page load
[10:42:01] <xec> Lyfesaver: i don't see any reason why you would load all the details of 700 items on 1st page load, but it sure is possible
[10:42:17] <Lyfesaver> i dont WANT to
[10:42:28] <xec> then why are you ;)
[10:42:38] <Lyfesaver> it is the only way that I.. with my little understanding of JS can figure out how to do it
[10:42:55] <xec> then i suggest you read some tutorials on how ajax works
[10:43:14] <Lyfesaver> ya shoky i am showing 700 items on page load... that part is fine, btu i am also having the page build divs with item details for each 700 at page load
[10:43:18] <Lyfesaver> that is what is killing me
[10:43:20] <Lyfesaver> the details
[10:43:32] <Lyfesaver> so u agree... AJAX is my only option?
[10:43:39] <shoky> you can build those serverside, no>
[10:43:39] <shoky> ?
[10:43:57] <shoky> when the page loads i can see 700 movies details ?
[10:44:04] <Lyfesaver> yes
[10:44:05] <xec> Lyfesaver: as far as i can tell, it would be beneficial, yes - seeing as you are not actually displaying any of these details
[10:44:13] <xec> until you click an item
[10:44:17] <Lyfesaver> right
[10:44:38] <shoky> so i cant see 700 movies details when page loads?
[10:44:42] <shoky> only when clicking ?
[10:44:51] <Lyfesaver> right they are all built
[10:44:54] <xec> shoky: yeah, they are in the html but hidden by js
[10:45:00] <Lyfesaver> but are hidden in dialogs til clicked
[10:45:08] <Lyfesaver> ya, what he said
[10:45:09] <shoky> then 700 movies details are NOT shown on page load
[10:45:12] <shoky> be exact
[10:45:15] <Lyfesaver> correct
[10:45:18] <xec> so he's doing like 700 calls to .dialog() on page load :D
[10:45:21] <Lyfesaver> SHOWN being the key word
[10:45:27] <shoky> then you DONT need to load all of them on page load
[10:45:35] <shoky> you only need to load what you want to be visible
[10:45:36] <shoky> on page load
[10:45:37] <Lyfesaver> its okay... u guys can laff at me... i will laff with u =)
[10:45:38] <xec> exactly
[10:45:41] <shoky> the rest you can load with ajax
[10:45:47] <shoky> no one is laughing at you..
[10:45:52] <Lyfesaver> i know =)
[10:45:57] <Lyfesaver> saying it was okay if u wanted to =)
[10:46:00] <Lyfesaver> LOL
[10:46:09] <tw2113> only load what you need
[10:46:20] <xec> Lyfesaver: you just stated you have limited js skills - it's okay, we wer alle begininers once
[10:46:24] <xec> were*
[10:46:27] <Lyfesaver> =)
[10:46:37] <Lyfesaver> okay so i have to use ajax then
[10:46:45] <tw2113> did anyone tell him about the secret alert() bug?
[10:46:45] <Lyfesaver> anyone have a good tip on where to go to learnit?
[10:46:55] <Lyfesaver> no tw2113
[10:46:58] <zps> hi n1 der?
[10:47:12] <tw2113> best not start ten Lyfesaver
[10:47:14] <tw2113> then*
[10:47:19] <tw2113> *runs away giggling*
[10:47:22] <Lyfesaver> LOL
[10:47:24] <Lyfesaver> =)
[10:47:36] <Lyfesaver> anyone have a good tip on where to go to learn AJAX as quickly as possible
[10:47:42] <Lyfesaver> been working on the for a month now =)
[10:47:43] <Lyfesaver> lol
[10:47:45] <xec> Lyfesaver: this might be helpful http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html#chapter-7
[10:47:50] <Lyfesaver> kk bro thx
[10:47:53] <tw2113> if there actually is some alert() bug, i'll be surprised, i was just teasing
[10:48:03] <Lyfesaver> hehe tw2113 =)
[10:48:07] <shoky> in IE i'd be surprised if there weren't
[10:48:20] <Lyfesaver> capt 7 xec?
[10:48:23] <tw2113> touche, but thanks for reminding me of that "browser" shoky
[10:48:24] <shoky> at least 5 alert bugs
[10:48:25] <Lyfesaver> chap 7*
[10:48:37] <Lyfesaver> ahh ya
[10:48:38] <xec> Lyfesaver: yes, chapter 7 is ajax
[10:48:41] <Lyfesaver> sry thats what link said
[10:48:46] <Lyfesaver> it just did not load to 7 for me
[10:48:56] <Lyfesaver> right on
[10:49:01] <Lyfesaver> giving it a read now =)
[10:49:18] <tw2113> I need to read that whole book
[10:49:20] <shoky> try going slowly, not as quickly as possible
[10:49:49] <shoky> memory works better that way
[10:50:05] <xec> Lyfesaver: what shoky said - spend some time with the material, the quicker you go through it, the more likely you will have issues in the future
[10:50:53] <tw2113> i know that rmurphey_afk does in fact have some clout in the area of javascript knowhow
[10:51:05] <Lyfesaver> k
[10:55:02] <Lyfesaver> okay quick question
[10:55:12] <Lyfesaver> am I going to have to use JSON for this?
[10:55:24] <Lyfesaver> if so i am goign to have to add the extensionsmethod in the webapp
[10:55:42] <shoky> dont rush thing
[10:55:43] <shoky> things
[10:56:09] <Lyfesaver> kk
[10:56:46] <shoky> JSON will probably come in handy, yes. but it's not neccessary
[10:57:02] <xec> Lyfesaver: you can send whatever you want from the server, in your case it might be easier to just send some html
[10:57:14] <Lyfesaver> thats what i am gathering so far... not NEEDED but it might be the best way to go
[10:57:23] <Lyfesaver> kk xec
[10:57:32] <Lyfesaver> i think it best to try it without JSON first anyway
[10:57:35] <Lyfesaver> see how it acts
[10:57:47] <Lyfesaver> but i still have a lot of reading to do first =)
[10:57:48] <tw2113> mmm json
[10:57:50] <Lyfesaver> lol

[11:08:33] <tw2113> it's like an ATM of data
[11:08:50] <zps> what are the different uses of jquery?
[11:09:05] <zps> 1
[11:09:07] <shoky> 2
[11:09:33] <shoky> zps: jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
[11:09:36] <tw2113> i'm shocked http://appjs.org/
[11:09:41] <zps> slider,??
[11:09:44] <tw2113> "Windows and Mac ports are still under heavy development. You can try it on Linux for now."
[11:09:55] <tw2113> how often does linux get first billing?
[11:10:22] <zps> tq shocky

[11:17:56] <Lyfesaver> a raid?
[11:18:01] <shoky> a movie
[11:18:06] <Lyfesaver> ahhhh
[11:18:36] <Lyfesaver> ya zps... reminds me more of multinode BBSes
[11:18:37] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:19:37] <zps> BBses?
[11:20:02] <aphid> heh, i ran a bbs back in .. '91?
[11:20:16] <Lyfesaver> ya i ran a WWIV from 89to 92
[11:20:28] <Lyfesaver> BBS is an oldschool min dial u internet
[11:20:33] <Lyfesaver> mini*
[11:20:38] <Lyfesaver> or u could telent
[11:20:52] <Lyfesaver> Bulliten Board System
[11:20:55] <Lyfesaver> is what BBS stood for
[11:21:03] <Lyfesaver> i htink they are still around
[11:21:07] <Lyfesaver> some of them anyway
[11:22:06] <switz> hey guys. i'm looking for a plugin that will help with lists (ul). just a few simple things like fixed headers (so they scroll with the list and switch when you hit a different part of the list) along with customized scroll bars. looking for a very lightweight solution. any ideas?
[11:22:34] <Lyfesaver> jquery ui does all that does it not?
[11:23:40] <switz> does it? i've never seen jqueryui for scrollable, just draggable droppable etc.
[11:24:21] <sviatovigt> can I add jquery code for an element that is half hidden beneath another with z-index=-1?
[11:24:34] <switz> direct link Lyfesaver?
[11:24:52] <Lyfesaver> http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[11:25:10] <switz> yeah, couldn't find anything there. a more direct link?
[11:25:10] <Lyfesaver> look under interactions switz
[11:25:16] <Lyfesaver> hmmmmm
[11:25:29] <switz> I don't think it has what I'm looking for...
[11:25:35] <Lyfesaver> damn kk
[11:25:41] <Lyfesaver> i am new to it myself
[11:25:51] <Lyfesaver> i just thot i saw something like that within the demos
[11:26:10] <Lyfesaver> but it might have been the telerik MVC UI that had it
[11:27:11] <zps> n1 horny?
[11:33:21] <tw2113> well i see where WP gets a lot of their admin stuff, jquery UI
[11:33:39] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:33:53] <tw2113> i've never tinkered with the library much
[11:34:19] <zps> 800-998-9938 (in the United States or Canada)
[11:54:55] <shippy> need a hint on this one if anyone is around:     <script type="text/javascript">

[11:55:24] <gnarf> shippy: NEVER paste code in IRC- use a pastebin
[11:55:36] <Lyfesaver> why not use jsfiddle or pastebin?
[11:55:40] <gnarf> please send me a private message when you get done spamming
[11:55:56] <gnarf> I'll give you permission back to speak in the channel
[11:56:06] <gnarf> ?p @shippy
[11:56:24] <shippy> hey... sorry about that all
[11:56:29] <shippy> i thought i copied the URL
[11:56:29] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:56:31] <Lyfesaver> it happens
[11:56:35] <shippy> but i misclicked  and ended up dumping everythign lol
[11:56:50] <shippy> how much of it did you see?  i thnk i accidently did 50+ lines
[11:57:02] <Lyfesaver> maybe 20 lines
[11:57:05] <Lyfesaver> if that
[11:57:09] <shippy> ah ok.. not quite as terribad
[11:57:13] <Lyfesaver> just put it all in apaste or jsfiddle
[11:57:17] <shippy> anywho... here it is: http://pastebin.com/WjKXA6wi
[11:57:31] <gnarf> shippy: i stopped it at the line after the commented alert "hello" + this.Goal.id
[11:57:41] <shippy> gnarf: thx for that
[11:58:11] <gnarf> shippy: that doesn't seem like the same code block ;)
[11:58:19] <Lyfesaver> lol
[11:58:20] <gnarf> shippy: and whats the issue you're having
[11:58:47] <shippy> haha ya, i have a bunch of filler in it that isn't related to my issue.. so i copied the full cod ein paste bin, removed bits, but then screwed up
[11:59:13] <rhizmoe> anyhoo
[11:59:29] <shippy> ok well, that alert doesn't seem to fire.. but in the div and div2 area i can see that the values match my if condition
[12:01:41] <shippy> oh, i get it
[12:01:43] <shippy> i
[12:01:51] <shippy> i'm assuming that hello function is running everytime the scrollbar changes
[12:01:55] <shippy> but it isnt
[12:01:57] <shippy> its just firing once
[12:04:10] <shippy> this works: http://pastebin.com/q3JjMQGU
[12:09:51] <somersb3> Hei. what is a good choice to implement a dashboard on the web page ?
[12:12:04] <xec> not to
[12:37:50] <whateverb> Im trying to make every row colums(<ul>) same height as row's heighest column
[12:37:51] <whateverb> http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/6/
[12:38:21] <whateverb> but how can I separate those columns with each() function
[12:40:13] <whateverb> right now its working for every ul tag together, I need to separate them by $('.row')
[12:46:11] <rodyhaddad> when you do something like: $("<div><ul><li></li></ul></div>"), the 3 DOM elements seem to be created. Does jQuery actually goes through each one and creates it (document.createElement), or does it just create the div, and use innerHTML for the others?
[13:19:18] <whateverb> why isn't it working? http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/14/
[13:28:17] <innociv> I have a bit of an issue using window.addEventListener("storage", etc);  The issue is that different browsers handle this differently.  The spec says to tell all *other* windows when storage is updated.  Old versions of IE, Firefox, and Opera all fire the event on *all* windows, including the one that invokes it.  How can I make sure my code behaves the same no matter the browser?
[13:28:39] <termite> anyone have any experience with qunit? I am writing some tests and I keep getting global failure error and I can't figure out why
[13:28:44] <innociv> Or how can I test if it's firing the "storage" event it in the window that is invoking it in the first place or not?
[13:29:36] <shoky> rodyhaddad: it uses innerHTML for that. (more specifically it creates a documentFragment into which it inserts an empty div, then it sets this div's innerHTML to your html string, and so on)
[13:30:09] <shoky> and it also caches the fragments for later use
[13:35:22] <dev_fluid> hello..if I have abn element whose style has been altered by class application, inline styles AND jquery, is there some easy way to take ALL of its current stylingsd and apply it to another element?
[13:37:28] <shoky> whateverb: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2qF6w/17/
[13:42:13] <shoky> whateverb: tho i like this more - http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2qF6w/18/
[13:46:36] <whateverb> thanks shoky!!
[13:57:47] <innociv> Is there a way I can patch the "storage" event so it works according to spec on all browsers?..
[13:59:43] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10567356/how-do-i-account-for-different-storage-event-behavior-between-browsers I put up a question here to be clearer.
[14:06:31] <raj> johnkpaul-afk, just saw you're hosting at the next jqnyc event. Looking forward to it ;)
[14:11:27] <Tomashe> there is a way to know if i scolled my page more then 100px from top?
[14:12:26] <innociv> $('document').scrollTop() ?
[14:12:39] <Tomashe> let me see
[14:12:45] <shoky> $('document')?
[14:13:03] <shoky> nope
[14:14:20] <Tomashe> there is a way to check on scroll ?
[14:14:46] <Tomashe> i want to add a class when scrollTop more then 100px and when less remove it
[14:14:49] <Tomashe> how do i do that ?
[14:14:50] <shoky> Tomashe there's scrollTop() method on jquery objects
[14:15:07] <shoky> and there is the scroll event you can listen to
[14:15:08] <shoky> on
[14:15:48] <Tomashe> how do i listen to scroll event?
[14:16:25] <shoky> see ?scroll
[14:16:28] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[14:17:04] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:17:08] <Tomashe> ok i will check that
[14:18:14] <Tomashe> thanks
[14:18:19] <shoky> hy raj
[14:18:41] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10567356/how-do-i-account-for-different-storage-event-behavior-between-browsers the localStorage "storage" event has inconsistent behavior in different browsers.  What do I do about that?
[14:19:03] <raj> hey shoky :)
[14:20:51] <raj> what're you up to?
[14:24:31] <shoky> not much ;) chilling some more before goin back to work tomorrow
[14:24:35] <shoky> sup
[14:25:10] <ravenzz> uhm is there a way to use $.getJSON synchronously?
[14:25:29] <shoky> yes (i think) but that is not recommended
[14:26:04] <systemfault> It's not recommended because it's stupid.
[14:26:40] <systemfault> If the server lags, the browser will freeze.. until it gets the response.
[14:26:44] <ravenzz> I have this jsonp request within a function, and on success I'd need to return a value from the data object
[14:27:09] <shoky> you'd need to return a value?
[14:27:12] <shoky> rethink your needs
[14:27:19] <ravenzz> but because it is asynchronous it fails every time
[14:27:30] <systemfault> Then work with the flow...
[14:27:32] <shoky> you can put whatever you want happening on success, in the success handler
[14:27:37] <systemfault> Instead of fighting it.
[14:28:20] <_ramok> hi
[14:28:22] <_ramok> and good evening
[14:28:24] <ravenzz> actually there could be a way to do that but I should reorganize the whole code
[14:28:29] <ravenzz> just to add this support
[14:28:37] <_ramok> is there a plugin where i can load pictures first when the part i want to display is in the view?
[14:28:39] <shoky> it shouldn't need a whole re-organization
[14:28:48] <ravenzz> i'll show you some code
[14:29:09] <shoky> unless it was very badly organized regardless of being synchronous
[14:29:31] <shoky> but yes you'd need to rewrite SOME stuff
[14:29:33] <ravenzz> the thing is that before this I didn't had the need to do a xhr request
[14:29:46] <systemfault> ravenzz: It's often like that :/
[14:30:30] <ravenzz> http://pastebin.com/Xh7B1zTk it is basically some js for a browser extension/bookmarklet
[14:30:42] <ravenzz> it run this code on twitter
[14:30:59] <ravenzz> and add image previews to the tweets
[14:31:13] <raj> shoky, you've been off?
[14:31:23] <ravenzz> I would like to add the dribbble support
[14:31:38] <shoky> raj, i was pretty much off the whole week, i am sometimes so very lazy ;)
[14:31:40] <ravenzz> line 55
[14:31:50] <shoky> this is why i am poor :(
[14:32:08] <ravenzz> but I basically need to play with the dribbble API in order to get the thumb
[14:32:26] <raj> well, you can't work _every_ week
[14:32:32] <shoky> :)
[14:32:43] <ravenzz> line 75 the xhr request
[14:32:54] <shoky> lately if i work 4 days then its a good week
[14:33:14] <raj> that sounds like a good week to me
[14:33:22] <raj> u finished finals?
[14:33:45] <shoky> hm what finals?
[14:33:52] <raj> oh, u were taking an exam last week
[14:34:03] <raj> figured it was finals, since everyone in the US of A is taking finals these days
[14:34:06] <systemfault> ravenzz: The only clean way to do it imho… is to change the signature of  drbl from function(elem) to function(elem, callback)
[14:34:07] <shoky> ahh that was 2 weeks ago
[14:34:30] <shoky> it was actually a second try, i failed the first time.
[14:34:44] <systemfault> ravenzz: Then do the getJSON call.. then when everything is done, you call the callback that was passed.
[14:34:45] <shoky> and now i failed the second time :) i hate exams
[14:34:51] <shoky> will need to redo this course sometime ;(
[14:35:05] <raj> dude, just leave that shit, move to the US and let's start this new business
[14:35:18] <shoky> hehh dude i want it to be super-easy to get a job
[14:35:25] <shoky> and i'm like 60% done  :\
[14:35:32] <raj> israel, with your drip irrigation. Forget that. We run sprinklers when it rains
[14:35:34] <raj> balllinnnn
[14:35:41] <shoky> hehh
[14:35:48] <shoky> what new business, btw ;)
[14:36:14] <ravenzz> systemfault I could use a callback but the thing is that i should move to a function the code from line 68 to 72
[14:36:36] <raj> the one I'm building night and day
[14:36:48] <shoky> ravenzz: moving stuff into functions is a great thing to do.
[14:36:50] <ravenzz> the I probably won't need to pass the callback, but it could be a method in the main object
[14:37:02] <systemfault> ravenzz: I guess.
[14:37:18] <shoky> raj i dont really know what it is :) something with cars?!
[14:38:28] <Sazpaimon> if I remove a video element in jquery, the video still continues to download
[14:38:37] <raj> exactly, hop on the next el al and we'll talk ;)
[14:38:46] <shoky> LoL
[14:39:02] <Sazpaimon> I also cannot re-add the video element, it won't render in the browser
[14:39:05] <shoky> el al is pricy :S
[14:39:16] <raj> israir?
[14:39:35] <shoky> nah i'll go with something european
[14:39:39] <systemfault> Eww Israel :/ I wouldn't like to live there
[14:39:56] <shoky> too many israelis here
[14:40:05] <systemfault> No problem with them..
[14:40:16] <raj> haha
[14:40:28] <shoky> its pretty nice in my neighbourhood
[14:40:46] <Sazpaimon> :/ guess i'll ask later
[14:40:47] <shoky> and i've lived in the US too
[14:40:49] <systemfault> But let's be honest… who would like to live in a place where all your neighbours hate you...?
[14:41:02] <systemfault> That's pretty much what happens there.
[14:41:03] <shoky> my neighbours like me
[14:41:16] <raj> prolly had more israely neighbors in LI than in Israel
[14:41:22] <shoky> :P
[14:41:47] <systemfault> Well.. in the case of Israel, I had in mind the other surrounding countries… (neighbours)
[14:41:57] <shoky> duh
[14:42:05] <raj> excellent tourist destinations
[14:42:09] <shoky> ;)
[14:42:17] <raj> if you're into waterboarding and blindfolds
[14:42:23] <shoky> ;D
[14:42:49] <systemfault> There are some really nice technology companies there
[14:42:58] <raj> ya there are
[14:43:51] <systemfault> IIRC, the Pentium M (What eventually evolved to be the Intel Core architecture was invented there)
[14:44:08] <shoky> ICQ also :\
[14:44:25] <systemfault> shoky: That wasn't a great moment :/
[14:44:29] <systemfault> ICQ sucks :P
[14:44:34] <shoky> it was for them
[14:44:38] <raj> yeah, cuz they lost my freaking account
[14:44:45] <shoky> ICQ was the first IM client
[14:44:47] <shoky> of course it'd suck
[14:44:59] <systemfault> Also.. don't forget that PHP still has a hebrew error message..
[14:45:06] <shoky> that didnt stop AOL from buying them for tons o cash
[14:45:07] <raj> ya?
[14:45:07] <systemfault> I wonder why they haven't changed it...
[14:45:18] <shoky> whut really?
[14:45:28] <systemfault> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_resolution_operator
[14:45:31] <raj> hebrew php error
[14:45:32] <systemfault> Read the PHP section
[14:45:41] <systemfault> $ php -r ::
[14:45:42] <systemfault> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM
[14:45:50] <shoky> hah wtf
[14:45:52] <shoky> :D
[14:46:05] <ravenzz> got it working \o/
[14:46:06] <systemfault> (It's not really hebrew.. but romanization of it)
[14:46:14] <shoky> yah
[14:46:18] <ravenzz> it was easier than how i have imagined ;9
[14:46:25] <raj> cool
[14:46:26] <systemfault> ravenzz: That's it baby!
[14:46:43] <raj> never saw that before
[14:46:43] <shoky> why tf would they call it that long romanized name
[14:46:51] <shoky> instead of TWO_COLONS
[14:46:58] <shoky> that is just awful
[14:47:50] <systemfault> shoky: The article tells why… But I wonder why they haven't changed it to english yet..
[14:48:13] <shoky> where does it tell why/
[14:48:29] <shoky> Israeli-developed hardly answhers why
[14:48:32] <shoky> answeres
[14:48:33] <shoky> @#$%@.
[14:48:34] <systemfault> But heh… PHP has never been the kingdom of consistency...
[14:48:34] <systemfault> The name "Paamayim Nekudotayim" was introduced in the Israeli-developed[1] Zend Engine 0.5 used in PHP 3. Although it has been confusing to many developers who don't speak Hebrew, it is still being used in PHP 5, as in this sample error message:
[14:48:45] <shoky> yeah that doesnt explain shit
[14:49:22] <shoky> other than php is a shitfest
[14:49:56] <systemfault> Weird saturday is weird.. :/
[14:54:25] <ravenzz> man this thing is sweet http://vimeo.com/41495357
[14:55:28] <shoky> nah
[14:55:56] <ravenzz> I like the folding effect
[14:56:18] <systemfault> :/ I know what is shittier than PHP… my internet connection today.
[14:56:55] <ravenzz> basically vimeo is slow anyway
[14:57:10] <ravenzz> or maybe it doesn't like me :p
[14:57:14] <shoky> this is much cooler: http://acko.net/blog/abusing-jquery-animate-for-fun-and-profit-and-bacon/
[14:58:10] <shoky> only works on chrome for me
[14:58:13] <systemfault> wut
[14:58:27] <systemfault> There are nice things that are chrome only :P
[14:58:37] <systemfault> Have you tried the new "CSS filters"?
[14:58:38] <ravenzz> ah yes I have seen that one, the idea is cool, but the design is not the best in the world ;)
[14:59:50] <shoky> i saw some filters demos
[15:00:02] <ravenzz> systemfault yes very cool, but it will take 5 years to become a standard
[15:00:03] <Sazpaimon> when I remove an html5 video element, the video continues to download
[15:00:16] <systemfault> Sazpaimon: The web isn't about standards anymore.
[15:00:35] <Sazpaimon> okay but what does that have to do with my issue
[15:00:38] <systemfault> Sazpaimon: It's about "Is X supported by the browsers I need" :/
[15:00:43] <systemfault> Nothing.. :/
[15:00:55] <systemfault> I don't know what is your issue Sazpaimon
[15:01:01] <Sazpaimon> [17:59] <Sazpaimon> when I remove an html5 video element, the video continues to download
[15:01:10] <Sazpaimon> i think you meant to highlight ravenzz
[15:01:11] <ravenzz> Sazpaimon have you tryied to stop the video before the remove it
[15:01:28] <Sazpaimon> ravenzz, html5 videos have no stop method, but even pausing it continues to download
[15:01:50] <Sazpaimon> ive tested in chrome and firefox and they both exhibit the same behavior
[15:02:14] <shippy> quick question: http://pastebin.com/rS3nWMZx
[15:02:16] <ravenzz> well pause?
[15:02:42] <Sazpaimon> as I said, "even pausing it continues to download"
[15:03:45] <ravenzz> ok I haven't deal with html5 video so far
[15:03:49] <ravenzz> but can you provide a demo?
[15:03:54] <systemfault> shippy: Doesn't matter, the function call should be in the .ready though
[15:04:20] <Sazpaimon> ravenzz, i mean I can give you a link to my site
[15:05:09] <Sazpaimon> i dont have any simple code though
[15:05:12] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10567356/how-do-i-account-for-different-storage-event-behavior-between-browsers the localStorage "storage" event has inconsistent behavior in different browsers.  What do I do about that?
[15:05:29] <shippy> systemfault: I see.. what if about this?   Would this work?  I want to make sure I understand how JS loads in the browser.. if it matters what order I put things: http://pastebin.com/hME7T2ZD
[15:05:56] <systemfault> shippy: Sure
[15:06:27] <systemfault> shippy: What ready does it that it defers the execution of the javascript inside until the whole DOM tree is built
[15:07:07] <ravenzz> Sazpaimon uhm ok what about the preload attribute?
[15:08:29] <shippy> systemfault: Gotcha.  I could bury the definition for this blah() function in another JS file that is loaded on my page, after this one.. and it would still work?
[15:10:02] <systemfault> shippy: Yes
[15:10:29] <shippy> systemfault: thanks for the help
[15:10:34] <systemfault> :)
[15:11:03] <ravenzz> Sazpaimon anyway it is an expected behaviour. even non html5 player continue to buffering the video
[15:12:35] <ravenzz> you can probably serve the video within an iframe and change its src when you don't need it anymore. otherwise you should change how your video server streams the content
[15:14:01] <Sazpaimon> ravenzz, it's expected behavior to continue to download the video even when the video element iself no longer exists?
[15:14:25] <ravenzz> do you remove it from the dom?
[15:14:27] <ravenzz> or hide it?
[15:14:36] <Sazpaimon> $("video").remove();
[15:14:52] <Sazpaimon> http://fiddle.jshell.net/NyXgv/show/light/ try it yourself
[15:15:13] <ravenzz> well it could be
[15:15:13] <Sazpaimon> (warning: full recall is playing in that fiddle)
[15:15:43] <ravenzz> if you think at how progressive streaming works
[15:16:12] <ravenzz> you basically download a temporary copy of the video
[15:16:28] <ravenzz> so it is not about the DOm?
[15:17:35] <Sazpaimon> if i add a window.stop() it kills the download
[15:17:46] <Sazpaimon> don't know if that's really what i want though
[15:19:00] <Sazpaimon> because running that in, say, firefox will stop animated gifs
[15:20:52] <phellarv> Anyonw awake? I have a problem in a loop where I try to create several div-elements using .add - It only shows the last one, even though I can see from the log that the loop have several iterations.
[15:21:02] <phellarv> Jquery Mobile
[15:22:35] <phellarv> http://pastebin.com/YkyQ4duk
[15:22:46] <phellarv> Anyone here care to take a look at the code?
[15:24:17] <innociv> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10567356/how-do-i-account-for-different-storage-event-behavior-between-browsers the localStorage "storage" event has inconsistent behavior in different browsers.  What do I do about that?
[15:25:16] <ravenzz> Sazpaimon yes, it is not a good idea
[15:34:24] <poppiez> isn't it possible to fetch remote RSS feeds using jquery?
[15:35:21] <StevenCodes22> poppiez,  With php yeah
[15:35:26] <StevenCodes22> maybe just ajax
[15:36:10] <ravenzz> Sazpaimon this seems to work http://fiddle.jshell.net/NyXgv/1/
[15:40:08] <poppiez> StevenCodes22: thx :)
[15:41:43] <StevenCodes22> poppiez,  np
[15:47:12] <shoky> ?demo @ phellarv
[15:47:13] <bot-t> phellarv, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:49:21] <amid_hasan> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[15:49:32] <shoky> h
[15:54:34] <phellarv> shoky: Uhm - I cannot do that, since this is a phonegap project for Android.
[15:55:31] <shoky> you can't recreate the issue in jsfiddle?
[15:55:36] <phellarv> shoky: But the basic idea is in the code - I cannot understand why I'm only getting the last .add from the iteration to show.
[15:55:37] <shoky> it doesn't have to look like your app
[15:56:05] <shoky> that code is awfully indented and out of context
[15:58:16] <eplehue> Hello. I was wondering if anybody knows how to get more than 5 items using a navbar with jquery mobile. I am building a web app for iPad. And 5 is not enough for me.
[15:58:31] <shoky> phellarv: did you not mean $('<div>')  where you put  $('div') ?
[15:59:31] <shoky> and $('<h3>') and $('<p>') ?
[16:00:50] <shoky> er
[16:01:29] <shoky> .
[16:02:41] <Carlitta87> can sumone guide me as to how to implement a jcarousel with a modal pop up feature?
[16:07:31] <shoky> Carlitta87: what have you got so far
[16:07:38] <MACscr> i must be having a brain fart as im trying to do something extremely simple, yet its not working: http://jsfiddle.net/VuUEV/1/
[16:07:54] <MACscr> the panel doesnt seem to show/slide down when click on the link
[16:08:14] <Aha2Y> Does jQuery have a way to check if a button is pressed (Keyboard)
[16:08:36] <MACscr> Aha2Y: js does, so yes. Did you even try googling it?
[16:08:49] <shoky> MACscr: you have spaces in your selectors
[16:08:56] <Aha2Y> MACscr: No, just wondered if it was posible. :)
[16:09:06] <shoky> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VuUEV/2/
[16:09:32] <MACscr> shoky: lol, i knew it was something simple. thanks!
[16:09:58] <eplehue> Is it possible to get more than 5 items in a navbar? (Yes i tried google :P no luck there)
[16:10:09] <shoky> horizontally, you mean?
[16:10:14] <eplehue> yes
[16:10:19] <shoky> no idea ;p
[16:10:26] <MACscr> of course you can
[16:10:30] <eplehue> its so strange.
[16:10:58] <eplehue> i tried it, but jquery just puts the buttons on two lines
[16:11:07] <MACscr> show us an example
[16:11:13] <MACscr> sounds like a simple css issue
[16:11:27] <eplehue> http://www.greitdesign.no/iqueue
[16:12:22] <eplehue> i am in the beginning of the process, so i havent edited the default css and js yet
[16:12:42] <phellarv> shoky: I'm not sure if I follow you?
[16:13:29] <shoky> phellarv: yeah disregard what i last said
[16:13:31] <MACscr> eplehue: so your asking for help on something you havent even tried troubleshooting yet?
[16:13:42] <shoky> phellarv: still, like i said that code is totally out of context
[16:13:53] <shoky> and very annoying to read
[16:14:05] <phellarv> shoky: Hehe - Why?
[16:14:12] <shoky> MACscr: he's asking about jquery mobile, not CSS
[16:14:17] <MACscr> eplehue: a simple firebug check shows that the widths are set to 20%, thus 5 items
[16:14:23] <shoky> phellarv: because of the indentation
[16:14:24] <MACscr> shoky: so?
[16:14:31] <eplehue> MACscr: believe me. I have tried editing it and following up on a tip I got, but it didnt work. So i reverted back it to default
[16:14:46] <shoky> obviously you can change anything you want with CSS
[16:16:11] <MACscr> trying to put more than 5 in that nav is just stupid anyway
[16:16:20] <eplehue> Why?
[16:16:20] <MACscr> of course it can be done though
[16:17:00] <phellarv> shoky: I basically want to add divs inside a div using the an array of objects return from the facebook api.
[16:17:13] <MACscr> lol, uh, because of the resolution width available in portrait mode on 80% of devices?
[16:17:23] <phellarv> s/the an/an/
[16:17:34] <MACscr> if you need a lot of nav items use a pull down menu
[16:17:38] <shoky> phellarv: first of all: http://pastebin.com/4P17AvrK
[16:17:40] <ajpiano> eplehue: this is what MACscr means ;) http://cl.ly/3H0L1h0f3d3X0K1s1J0d
[16:18:19] <eplehue> MACscr: i get that. but this web app is only going to be used on an ipad
[16:18:29] <eplehue> on an internal server
[16:19:00] <MACscr> then adjust accordingly
[16:19:05] <MACscr> its a simple css change as i mentioned
[16:19:09] <MACscr> takes 5 seconds
[16:19:38] <eplehue> I'll try it
[16:19:49] <shoky> phellarv: what do you mean to do with this line:     var a = $("#content").add('div').data("theme", "a") ...
[16:19:51] <eplehue> Sorry. I am not exactly a pro here :) Still learning
[16:20:53] <phellarv> I want to add a div inside $("#content") - Which is a div inside the <body>.
[16:20:54] <MACscr> eplehue: but you know css well right? I mean, you wouldnt be using a framework like this without knowing the basics of web design would ya?
[16:21:04] <shoky> phellarv: that's not how you add a div
[16:21:19] <shoky> phellarv: first of all, you mean .append()  not .add()
[16:21:26] <eplehue> MACscr: I know the basics yeah.
[16:21:43] <shoky> phellarv: second,  you mean  .append('<div>')
[16:21:43] <MACscr> also, if your making something specifically for an ipad, i have no idea why you were even using this framework
[16:21:58] <phellarv> shoky: Mmm - Ok, but can I manipulate it with .data?
[16:22:00] <eplehue> MACscr: How come?
[16:22:56] <MACscr> because the tablet side of things is more an afterthought IMHO. Its mainly geared towards smaller resolution devices. At least thats my experiences with it.
[16:23:00] <shoky> phellarv: yes but not like that.  var div = $('<div>').data('theme',...).data(.., ..).appendTo('#content')
[16:23:03] <shoky> for example
[16:23:43] <MACscr> plus you can pretty much design an "app" in a regular desktop fashion and have it work well on a tablet
[16:23:43] <eplehue> MACscr: Ok. I understand what you mean.
[16:23:51] <shoky> phellarv: but for now you should be doing:  var div = $('<div>');    div.data(....);     $('#content').append(div);
[16:24:57] <phellarv> shoky: Thanks, I'm going to try that right now.
[16:29:27] <Carlitta87> shoky: ive been able to do a carousel...but i got frustrated....i really need a break... :(
[16:35:12] <PhonicUK> hey all, I'm having an issue where the helper for a .draggable() element is no where near the cursor
[16:35:18] <PhonicUK> and isn't obeying the containment option
[16:35:42] <PhonicUK> its contraining itself to the parent even though i'm using a 'wider' selector
[16:35:59] <whateverb> can I change someVar value in URL with jquery without refresh? www.mydomain.com?someVar=1 to www.mydomain.com?someVar=2
[16:36:58] <PhonicUK> whateverb, nope - but you can change the value of anything after the # without a refrehs
[16:37:02] <PhonicUK> *refresh
[16:37:04] <PhonicUK> why?
[16:38:02] <whateverb> Im using ajax to switch calendar weeks so I would like to give user change to refresh page then or save url to maintain week current position
[16:38:34] <PhonicUK> then use a fragment
[16:38:52] <PhonicUK> its how google maps etc does it so you can bookmark a location
[16:39:17] <whateverb> oh, thanks..looking into it
[16:45:00] <PhonicUK> grrr
[16:45:06] <PhonicUK> I do:
[16:45:10] <PhonicUK> $(".toolboxicon").draggable({containment: "document", scroll: false, revert: true, helper: "clone"});
[16:45:35] <PhonicUK> but it won't drag outside the current element
[16:46:04] <ajpiano> PhonicUK: document isn't a string, it's an elemen
[16:46:35] <PhonicUK> ajpiano, the documentation says you can specify document as a string
[16:46:43] <shoky> Possible string values: 'parent', 'document', 'window', [x1, y1, x2, y2]
[16:46:46] <ajpiano> interesting
[16:46:47] <PhonicUK> ^
[16:46:55] <ajpiano> isn't containment: false the exact same thing as "document" anyway
[16:47:15] <PhonicUK> lets find out
[16:47:32] <PhonicUK> behaves the same, still won't drag outside the element
[16:47:53] <shoky> i wish .resizable() containment also had the [x1, y1, x2, y2]  option :((
[16:48:09] <ajpiano> i can't really help unless i see a fiddle
[16:48:24] <ajpiano> alsh stop watching hockey and drinking beer :|
[16:48:27] <PhonicUK> i'll see if i can replicate it in something small
[16:50:42] <PhonicUK> hmm, jsfiddle is broken
[16:50:49] <PhonicUK> ah
[16:50:59] <PhonicUK> no, it is broken
[16:53:39] <whateverb> If Im using $.ajax in .each function does then success: callback starts in the end of the each loop?
[16:56:36] <PhonicUK> okay i found the problem
[16:56:50] <PhonicUK> the classes the helper is inheriting is stopping it from being positioned properly
[16:58:21] <valenn_> Need some help with jsonpCallback not firing
[16:58:45] <shoky> whateverb: sucess callback starts when the ajax request is successful
[16:59:02] <valenn_> not got right to error state
[16:59:11] <valenn_> but I'm getting 200 in my api
[16:59:22] <valenn_> *no right to error stata
[17:00:21] <valenn_> the callback is not firing
[17:00:45] <valenn_> console message - Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type application/json.
[17:05:39] <systemfault> valenn_: Perhaps you're not sending the proper JSONP from the server.
[17:05:58] <systemfault> Seems that you're sending JSON
[17:07:22] <PhonicUK> hmm
[17:07:32] <PhonicUK> when I drop a draggable
[17:07:46] <PhonicUK> whats the best way of knowing what element i just dropped on to?
[17:09:34] <PhonicUK> nevermind
[17:10:35] <valenn_> thanks
[17:11:33] <someprimetime> setup an event listener on the container
[17:27:57] <PhonicUK> hmm
[17:28:10] <PhonicUK> event.stopPropagation(); doesn't seem to behave properly with .droppable
[17:29:14] <PhonicUK> aah
[17:29:18] <PhonicUK> its got an extra option for it
[17:30:37] <PhonicUK> horray

[17:49:11] <systemfault> Well… he was annoying.
[17:49:52] <ThrushAAX> then just don't respond....
[17:50:42] <\mSg> already left
[17:50:52] <\mSg> oh, and came back :D
[17:50:59] <Dr-Bombay> the begging was worse than the pasting
[17:51:54] <ThrushAAX> the rudeness is worse than the begging ;-p
[17:52:12] <ThrushAAX> oooohhh, that lined up
[17:53:54] <iiipppi> please help me with these conflict......http://jsfiddle.net/zUqta/2/
[17:54:30] <ThrushAAX> looking
[17:56:04] <iiipppi> problem with....script....
[17:57:57] <ThrushAAX> iiipppi: what part doesn't work
[17:58:05] <ThrushAAX> does firebug give you any errors?
[17:58:56] <iiipppi> ThrushAAX : eislider and lightbox had conflict i guess..
[17:59:42] <iiipppi> no conflict doesn't work....like this  <script>jQuery.noConflict(true);</script>
[18:00:04] <ThrushAAX> they shouldn't have an issue working together
[18:00:17] <ThrushAAX> and you shouldn't need to do that noConflict() thing
[18:00:25] <iiipppi> ah.....
[18:00:37] <iiipppi> then what is the solution...?
[18:00:45] <ThrushAAX> 2 things
[18:00:54] <ThrushAAX> 1: remove that noConflict
[18:01:20] <ThrushAAX> 2: remove the extra include of <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"></script>
[18:02:09] <iiipppi> OMG !!!!
[18:02:14] <iiipppi> It's working !!!
[18:02:29] <ThrushAAX> yeah, jquery plugins work great together
[18:02:54] <iiipppi> Thank you so much !!!!!! I had a problem with these for 2day...
[18:02:55] <ThrushAAX> noConflict is when you use something that isn't jquery and that something messes with the $
[18:03:10] <ThrushAAX> haha, no problem, your welcome
[18:03:21] <iiipppi> Thank you !!!!! :) !!!!!
[18:09:11] <Dr-Bombay> bah
[18:20:38] <Dr-Bombay> just what the heck IS a "social game" anyway
[18:21:42] <Dr-Bombay> i associate that phrase more with people sitting around a table playing cards, not someone on the bus staring at their phone and oblivious to the rest of the world
[18:22:10] <mydog2> xec, - hey
[18:23:55] <mydog2> i've got a test page.. it has ah href that runs a javscript function. is there a way to directly run that function from a jquery script?
[18:24:40] <mydog2> in other words, does jquery permit running the function in the href.. i would imagine there's a simple way to do this..
[18:26:28] <ThrushAAX> uhhhmmm, normally you do a .on('click', some_function ) for those kinds of things
[18:27:46] <Dr-Bombay> move it out of the href and into your script as a click handler, like a civilized person :)
[18:28:51] <innociv> how do i fire the same event as the "storage" event fired by localStorage?
[18:30:56] <Dr-Bombay> are you using a jquery plugin for local storage
[18:31:32] <Whirl3d> Good evening. Can anyone tell me a logical reason that .clone() would clone the id attribute of an element if they are supposed to be unique? It seems unnecessary if you actually plan to do anything with the clone. Especially if your forget to change the id...
[18:34:38] <hgh> on this site http://colloquiums.org the jquery layer is sometimes delayed to a degree greater than i'd like to see.  id like to know if there if there is some obvious mistake in the placement of the jquery script, or just what the issue is
[18:35:25] <ThrushAAX> Whirl3d: why would clone automatically change anything? its not a clone then...
[18:35:26] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d: clone returns an element that is not associated with a document, so it doesn't have the constraint on ids than you think it does
[18:35:44] <ThrushAAX> what if you wanted to remove the id of the original?
[18:36:03] <Whirl3d> That sounds like a special use case to me
[18:36:17] <Whirl3d> whereas I regularly append a clone of a template item to the dom
[18:36:27] <Whirl3d> with the same friggin id because I'm retarded
[18:36:43] <Whirl3d> then I spend an hour or two trying to figure out why my selectors are messing up.
[18:36:43] <ThrushAAX> hgh: have you tried y-slow firebug extension?
[18:37:16] <Whirl3d> I think I'm just gonna monkey patch it to do what I want until I can find a good reason to keep it the way it is.
[18:37:30] <ThrushAAX> Whirl3d: don't select your templates by id?
[18:37:42] <Whirl3d> yes
[18:37:55] <Whirl3d> that's the problem. See
[18:37:55] <ThrushAAX> I would do something like $("#template_section > .particual_template").clone()
[18:38:15] <innociv> Dr-Bombay, no
[18:38:44] <Whirl3d> actually, I keep my template-able items all over the place rather than just in a single section
[18:38:45] <shoky> Whirl3d: removing the id attribute would just be more work for jquery
[18:38:56] <Whirl3d> I'm having to do it anyways
[18:39:03] <shoky> and would not really be a clone, as Dr-Bombay said
[18:39:10] <Dr-Bombay> whirl3d: clone follows the principle of least surprise. It merely clones, assuming that you will do anything else that needs to be done differently from a clone
[18:39:16] <hgh> ThrushAAX: no
[18:39:31] <Whirl3d> sure, but I'm willing to sacrifice the idea semantics for a product that saves me from hours of work.
[18:39:50] <Whirl3d> *ideal
[18:40:06] <innociv> i want to know how to fire the event in normal javascript. I'm not sure if jquery makse that any easier
[18:40:19] <innociv> I want to fire the actual "storage" event, not a custom one
[18:40:19] <shoky> .removeAttr('id')   is hours of work?
[18:40:28] <Whirl3d> that's after the fact
[18:40:36] <Whirl3d> I often forget to add that line.
[18:40:45] <Whirl3d> Now, I just monkeypatch clone to do it for me.
[18:40:48] <ThrushAAX> hmm, apparently what I do is <script id="messageTemplate" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">htmlhere</script> then just $("#messageTemplate").template("message");
[18:41:01] <shoky> then maybe your element should not have had an id in the first place
[18:41:11] <ThrushAAX> though no idea what template system you are using...
[18:41:11] <Whirl3d> probably true.
[18:41:20] <Whirl3d> not using a system.
[18:41:43] <innociv> like "$(window).trigger('storage', 'test'); " doesn't do anything so I'd guess not
[18:41:48] <ThrushAAX> hgh: check if out! it gives lots of info on the site and what is slowing it down
[18:42:20] <Whirl3d> Like if I have a thumbnail factory that clones the thumbnail holder source (which includes the bg div for the thumbnail, the anchor, the image (without a src attribute).
[18:42:45] <Dr-Bombay> lol "webvtt"
[18:42:49] <Dr-Bombay> "web butt"
[18:42:56] <Dr-Bombay> huhuhuhuh
[18:43:02] <shoky> if you clone something that has an id, and the fact that it has that id bothers you, then you'd be needing to change the id anyway no? i dont see the issue
[18:43:44] <shoky> guess i should rephrase that
[18:43:47] <shoky> but i wont
[18:44:04] <Whirl3d> well, shoky, with all due respect, it's_not_ an issue for you. I have a perfectly good solution that works for me, I was just making sure there wasn't something important that I was missing
[18:44:24] <shoky> misuse of ids, it seems
[18:45:05] <shoky> with all due respect, whether the issue is yours or mine, i still dont SEE it
[18:47:12] <Whirl3d> In the last week, I have spent at least six hours messing up my code over something really stupid: I forgot that a deep copy of one of my elements contained an ID attribute. My mistake, not jquery's or anything. And as I went back to a couple of older projects that I gave up on, sure enough there was the same problem. I realized that I was using clone incorrectly, but also realized that by
[18:47:12] <Whirl3d> changing the thing about clone that I forget, I was able to regain som productivity.
[18:47:15] <Whirl3d> not a big deal.
[18:51:21] <shoky> k ;p
[18:52:16] <brownies> hi
[18:52:23] <shoky> sup
[18:52:47] <brownies> i am using backbone to programmatically insert <li> elements into a <ul> but it seems the page rendering widget of JQM does not kick in to render those <li>s in the nice way that it should
[18:52:57] <brownies> which event(s) should i be binding to in order to render this out?
[18:54:53] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: yo
[18:54:56] <someprimetime> i'm writing a modal plugin
[18:55:01] <someprimetime> what options should i have in it
[18:58:55] <rhizmoe> for $('#foo').on("ajax:success") will that catch any successes in children of #foo? http://pastie.org/3902896
[18:59:12] <rhizmoe> and children's children, natch
[18:59:39] <innociv> var evt = document.createEvent("Events"); evt.initEvent("storage", false, false); is close.. What else am I missing?
[19:02:09] <phellarv> Probably a bit off-topic, but how do I re-apply a css for a page?
[19:02:50] <phellarv> I now where to put the call, but not what call to put there.
[19:04:25] <antaranian> hi ladies
[19:09:29] <innociv> phellarv, make a jsfiddle maybe? it should be $('style').load() if it's possible.
[19:09:38] <innociv> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/StorageEvent I'm looking here but still can't figure how to create and fire a "storage" event.
[19:12:20] <Dr-Bombay> innociv: you're missing a dispatchEvent call on the storage object?
[19:12:34] <Dr-Bombay> sending a fake storage event seems like a really weird thing to do tho
[19:12:40] <innociv> That's not the problem. The problem is that the storage event isn't the proper event..
[19:12:47] <innociv> Well I want to send one that looks real.
[19:12:51] <aphid> innociv - seen http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html#storage-event ?
[19:13:17] <Dr-Bombay> innociv wants to cause a storage event, not just handle one
[19:13:34] <aphid> without changing anythign in the storage?
[19:13:42] <innociv> yes, basically
[19:13:58] <innociv> The issue is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10567356/how-do-i-account-for-different-storage-event-behavior-between-browsers
[19:14:19] <innociv> I'm trying to make all the browsers handle the event the same, which means making spec compliant ones fire the event when they're not supposed to.
[19:14:57] <aphid> that looks ... unfortunate
[19:15:19] <innociv> Yeah.
[19:15:50] <innociv> I made a way to check if it's compliant or not.  Now I need to fire the event manually when it is.
[19:16:37] <aphid> The problem with the cutting edge is that someone has to bleed.
[19:17:09] <innociv> This isn't that new.
[19:17:12] <innociv> localStorage was in IE8.
[19:17:26] <innociv> It's just that it's not spec compliant in many older browsers, or even in IE9.
[19:18:45] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/fUyav/25/ hm also, what am I doing wrong in setting that function? Says it's not one
[19:20:55] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/fUyav/30/ ah well I'll just do this for the function name.  But anyways, yeah still, the event thing..
[19:21:01] <ColKurtz> hey #jquery
[19:24:06] <Dr-Bombay> A software manager had a problem and wasn't sure what to do. "I know," said the manager, "I'll go agile." Now the manager had two problems.
[19:24:38] <systemfault> Agile doesn't even have a meaning anymore...
[19:24:58] <systemfault> It's * except big design up front…. even if it's shit.
[19:37:24] <ColKurtz> Does Same Origin apply even if you want to perform a GET request for HTML?
[19:38:01] <systemfault> Yes monsieur
[19:41:15] <ColKurtz> what about loading an image dynamically? Could you just create a new $("<img />").appendTo("#container); and change it's src to a URI on a different domain?
[19:42:22] <Dr-Bombay> same-origin does not apply to image sources
[19:42:33] <ColKurtz> Yeah that's what I figured
[19:53:27] <ColKurtz> ty
[19:58:14] <innociv> ColKurtz, yes but then you need to .load() i believe
[19:59:11] <doughj3> I'm having an issue with $.inArray(), it is apparently not finding the an element even though it's in the array. This only happens when it's the last element.
[19:59:13] <ColKurtz> yeah load as well as a way to check if it's in the cache
[19:59:21] <doughj3> But I can't reproduce it with a simple test case.
[19:59:48] <psyolus> When using jQuery.ajax with type 'jsonp', is it possible to specify what parameter to use for the name of the callback ('jsonp' instead of the documented 'callback', for instance)?
[20:00:16] <doughj3> Nevermind. Think I got it.
[20:00:25] <ColKurtz> psyolus yes I'm pretty sure. I was looking into this recently. Read the documentation on jsonp
[20:00:41] <psyolus> Oh, whoops. It's the jsonpCallback parameter.
[20:00:45] <psyolus> Herp.
[20:01:06] <ColKurtz> lol
[20:01:18] <psyolus> No, wait. That just sets the callback. Not the parameter.
[20:03:01] <psyolus> Ah. Just jsonp.
[20:03:44] <digitalcakestudi> I'm using a .each() of a few forms I have were I need to get the values in hidden fields. But then I need to append a calculation to a button in that form.   where as this = the form how do I select the button with a class of place-button?
[20:05:16] <ColKurtz> digitalcakestudi try making a jsfiddle.
[20:05:52] <Whirl3d> var btn=$(this).find(".place-button");
[20:06:12] <digitalcakestudi> http://jsfiddle.net/   sorry its ugly code
[20:06:53] <Whirl3d> lol. you didin't include the fiddle information.
[20:07:07] <digitalcakestudi> oh looks like I didnt save
[20:07:15] <digitalcakestudi> http://jsfiddle.net/zB7Jx/1/
[20:07:50] <digitalcakestudi> so jQuery(this.button).append("> " + m + " Miles Away") is whats wrong
[20:08:37] <digitalcakestudi> thanks find is what  I was looking for
[20:08:42] <Whirl3d> jQuery(this).find(".buttonclass").append(...
[20:09:02] <digitalcakestudi> Thanks for the help Whirl3d
[20:09:30] <Whirl3d> sure. Just remember if you have more than one element of that class it will find them all. Even if they are nested.
[20:10:41] <digitalcakestudi> yeah I have a hacked form list where I have made a form for each location so I can store the lat, log so I can send them as arguments on selection
[20:10:57] <digitalcakestudi> I'm sure I'm doing it all :)
[20:11:00] <digitalcakestudi> wrong
[20:11:25] <digitalcakestudi> but it works no so who cares :)
[20:11:39] <Whirl3d> where do you get the source latlong stuff from?
[20:11:40] <digitalcakestudi> cant say the same for my typing though
[20:11:54] <digitalcakestudi> geocode ruby gem
[20:12:02] <digitalcakestudi> and google places api
[20:12:24] <Whirl3d> cause you could just store the pairs in the objects  using .data
[20:12:30] <Whirl3d> and access it that way.
[20:13:09] <Whirl3d> if you have a placename with a lat and long , $("element").data("placename", {lat:latvalue, long:longvalue});
[20:13:09] <digitalcakestudi> making a designated driver request app for drunk people.
[20:13:24] <psyolus> What is the point of the jsonp callback if the data is passed to the success function, anyway?
[20:13:50] <systemfault> sigh...
[20:14:21] <systemfault> Because there's no such thing as JSONP… it's javascript.
[20:14:38] <systemfault> What you receive from the server is a function call...
[20:14:42] <digitalcakestudi> the problem is the lat/log are stored in ruby and I dont know if I can get them in the js so I would end up rending them to the dom one way or another
[20:15:33] <psyolus> Right. So why are both the callback and the success functions going?
[20:15:41] <psyolus> Shouldn't it just be the callback?
[20:16:00] <systemfault> psyolus: The "callback" receives the javascript object then it's passed by jquery to the success handler.
[20:17:18] <systemfault> psyolus: When you call the JSONP service, you specify a callback function that the server (PHP or whatever) will pad the JSON with
[20:18:05] <systemfault> http://lol.lulz?callback=rofl        then you'll receive the following javascript: rofl({"lol": "zomg", "rofl": 10 });
[20:44:12] <psyolus> Sorry. Hardware failure.
[20:47:00] <mda_> I have about 4000 dialog pages, where their content is wrapped by the same html code....is there an easy way to inject that rather than have a hardcoded copy in every file?  Say a javascript that won't break jquery's dialog mechanism?  (It's actually jQuery mobile, but the channel is silent.)
[20:55:36] <zps> morning
[20:56:28] <Whirl3d> any way to determine the actual width of an element with display='none' (without changing it to display:"inlineblock", opacity0 for just a second)?
[20:56:55] <Whirl3d> zps, morning
[21:08:50] <oojacoboo> Whirl3d you could use visibility: hidden instead
[21:10:42] <shippy> anyone use sublime?
[21:11:03] <tw2113> text?
[21:12:36] <shippy> ya
[21:12:50] <tw2113> i do i do
[21:12:56] <tw2113> i even made a custom irc command for it
[21:12:57] * tw2113 suggests to download http://www.sublimetext.com/ for all your text editor needs
[21:13:10] <shippy> can i ask you a question about snippets?
[21:13:23] <tw2113> you can, but i can't guarantee a helpful answer
[21:13:38] <shippy> I see all these snippets in the 'browse packages' drop down (PHP folder for example)
[21:13:39] <tw2113> but i'd try
[21:13:46] <shippy> but I can't trigger any of them with tab
[21:14:10] <shippy> do I need to load these in somehow?  they don't show up under Tools->Snippets either
[21:14:11] <shippy> oddly enough
[21:14:30] <tw2113> have you simply tried typing out the trigger and then hitting tab?
[21:14:37] <shippy> ya
[21:14:46] <tw2113> instead of ctrl+shift+p, type, enter
[21:15:02] <shippy> oh wait, nevermind
[21:15:04] <shippy> it works now
[21:15:49] <tw2113> the fun is making your own
[21:16:08] <shippy> definitely.. I use cakephp a lot and I don't see much in that dept
[21:16:18] <tw2113> i went simple for one
[21:16:21] <tw2113> "jqready"
[21:16:40] <tw2113> which gives me a script block with $(document).ready(function() { etc
[21:17:04] <shippy> nice.. the jquery package snippet is great so far
[21:17:12] * zps slaps bot-t around a bit with a large trout
[21:17:13] * bot-t dodges zps's attack and slaps back!
[21:17:18] <shippy> i don't know how i lived without sublime text before this.. i'm coming from komodo edit
[21:17:44] * zps slaps shippy around a bit with a large trout
[21:18:52] <IvanBliminse> Does anyone know how to delcare a variable inside a jquery event ( IE $(select).whatever(function(){ var x = 1; }); ) that has the same scope as variable declared outside of the jquery function?
[21:19:17] <IvanBliminse> I tried, naively, window.var = { } ... didn't work
[21:20:02] <tw2113> declare the variable outside the event, assign it inside?
[21:20:21] <tw2113> just a guess that's worth a shot
[21:21:08] <IvanBliminse> I was trying to keep from declaring that variable, that way if the event never happens it will never get declared, but I need it to persist once the event function ends.. like in a counter
[21:21:49] <tw2113> i'm no pro with js still, but that's probably what i'd end up doing
[21:24:26] <tw2113> *burps*
[21:25:49] <lcj> can anyone recommend a good tutorial with a clean why to make a left-navigation-menu that has a little icon/arrow (actually much like Finder on mac or the sublimetext editor's left nav) that expands the menu on click on the icon/arrow and reveals the navigations 3rd level?
[21:28:30] <IvanBliminse> answer to my own question, you do attach it to window.. my mistake was i was doing var window.x = { }  instead of just   window.x =  { }
[21:52:51] <rodd> Hi, is there any way that I can set my plugin to a 'live' state, that is, enable it to newly added items? short example: $( '.box' ).myPlugin(); that obviously won't trigger for new elements, added by an ajax call

[22:26:39] <pixeltarian> does anyone know of a library or plugin or framework for diagrams?
[22:26:43] <pixeltarian> like so: http://gyazo.com/02c65c329519df4378e0e59742ea62ea
[22:27:06] <pixeltarian> Not thought-bubble diagrams, but square footage of structures diagrams.
[22:31:39] <amh345> Can anyone help me out with this? ive seen it before but i cant seem to find it again.   im grabbing some content from a div and dumping it to another div.  that's all well and good. the thing i cant figure out is i want to create a div and wrap said content before i place it in the -new- parent div.
[22:32:35] <amh345> there's stuff like $(content).appendTo("<div class='child_div>") …  but i think there's a better way to do it, no?
[22:33:12] <amh345> maybe it's innerHtml
[22:43:11] <tw2113> ?append
[22:43:11] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[22:43:14] <tw2113> ?appendto
[22:43:15] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[22:43:25] <tw2113> i'm sure both would work
[22:47:54] <amh345> ok, i figured it out.   it was append :)
[22:49:15] <tw2113> just remember, with append() you pass in what you want appended to append()
[22:49:26] <tw2113> with appendTo() you pass in the element you want things appeneded to
[22:49:36] <amh345> now there's a new issue.  it's adding a class for each item clicked. which is correct.  but im passing some data when an item is clicked. the data is what's getting inserted into the new div.   only problem is each time i click it adds that data to all the divs, since it's a div class.  i dont know if that makes sense.
[22:50:00] <tw2113> non-unique class?
[22:50:23] <amh345> i guess that's what ill have to do. or at least give it a standard class but unique id.
[22:50:50] <tw2113> probably in the click event, you can use "this" and hopefully append it to just the current one
[22:51:27] <tw2113> $(this).append() vs $('.foo').append
[22:51:41] <tw2113> i think my syntax is right with the first one
[22:52:35] <amh345> $(this) …  how is the class defined then?
[22:52:54] <amh345> $('new_class').append(values)
[22:53:29] <tw2113> $('.foo').click(fuction(){ $(this).append(); });
[22:53:38] <amh345> ohhhhhh
[22:54:05] <amh345> i dont think that'll go. ill post a quick pastie of what i've got
[22:54:14] <tw2113> jsfiddle.net
[22:54:21] <tw2113> interactive instead of text only
[22:54:38] <amh345> right right. ok setting it up ow
[22:54:39] <amh345> now
[22:55:09] <amh345> this is going to be a bit of a trick. there's a ton of code around it
[23:00:39] <amh345> tw2113: ok, this works and reproduces the problem.   there's no css formatting though. http://jsfiddle.net/8fxTx/1/
[23:00:53] <amh345> if you click 'add to cart' you'll see it add to both some_div divs
[23:01:06] <mda_> The jquerymobile channel is as silent as tumbleweed.  I even tried Cat Daddying!
[23:01:06] <amh345> which makes sense with the way it's coded. but incorrect to how i'd like it to function
[23:06:07] <tw2113> unsure really
[23:07:21] <amh345> i thnk if i just create a common class and a unique id- that might work
[23:07:34] <tw2113> what you have right now doesn't allow for clicking the add to cart many times without compounding
[23:08:22] <amh345> yeah. im not sure if there was a better approach.
[23:08:29] <tw2113> i'm sure there is
[23:08:29] <amh345> probably was. heh
[23:08:44] <tw2113> just not found by yourself yet
[23:10:08] <amh345> yeah. ill deal with it later.
[23:13:19] <tw2113> i use WordPress a lot, I still haven't figured out an effective way to properly select stuff within post loops
[23:13:32] <tw2113> using jQuery individually on each one
[23:15:43] <amh345> i havent touched wordpress yet
[23:15:58] <amh345> heres a question.  how would i insert a js var into a string like this? ("<div class='some_div'>")
[23:16:20] <Arist_> how can i clear data from jquery dialog form before i open it and clear up after i update the form data ?
[23:17:28] <amh345> ok, i see how it's done.
[23:18:10] <amh345> append("<div class='some_div' id=" + value_id + ">");
[23:19:43] <amh345> $("#"+value_id).append(value_name); not exactly the nicest look code. heh
[23:19:55] <amh345> but.. it does the trick
[23:20:11] <ndss56> tw2113: you have to read all the posts into a jquery DOM object. Select appropriate Post/Node by traversing the DOM object. Goodluck.
[23:23:42] <tw2113> so basically group all the posts together in jQuery, then somehow choose and act on each post individually
[23:23:54] <tw2113> got it
[23:24:57] <tw2113> ndss56 would something like bind() be good in this case?
[23:25:19] <tw2113> or on()
[23:25:39] <ndss56> tw2113: why bind()/on()?
[23:25:52] <tw2113> just trying to think things out a little
[23:25:57] <tw2113> and curious about those two anyway
[23:26:23] <ndss56> tw2113: each post has a link?
[23:26:31] <tw2113> usually
[23:26:46] <tw2113> i'm not actually trying to solve an issue like this at the moment
[23:26:57] <tw2113> it's just always been in the back of my head, rattling around
[23:26:59] <Dr-Bombay> there are security risks to throwing an arbitrary string in the middle of an HTML fragment
[23:27:38] <ndss56> tw2113: i'd probably use on() over bind(), assuming i even need to use it.
[23:28:09] <tw2113> yeah, the bind page said on is preferred more after 1.7
[23:29:06] <Dr-Bombay> amh: you really should create your element without the attribute, then set the attribute
[23:31:10] <tw2113> which is preferred for not letting anchor links from going? preventDefault() or return false?
[23:32:38] <Dr-Bombay> just imagine if value_id happened to be '""><iframe src="http://pwned.org/"'
[23:35:51] <tw2113> nevermind, found my answer in the comments of preventDefault
[23:39:26] <tw2113> ?load
[23:39:26] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
