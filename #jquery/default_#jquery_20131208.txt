[05:53:02] <Jagst3r21> I cannot get this to work, for local storage. I am trying to hide a notification bar IF the user clicks close. it should bee hidden until the user clears their browsing data or whatever
[05:53:05] <Jagst3r21> http://hastebin.com/dulopebiwo.coffee
[05:56:58] <Jagst3r21> anyone? :(
[06:06:04] <hayalet> http://jsfiddle.net/uR8Gj/4/ also it seems that you are using .coffee extension for non-coffeescript
[06:07:19] <Jagst3r21> that is odd
[06:08:45] <Jagst3r21> hayalet do i need a message on my site warning users we are using localstorage
[06:08:50] <Jagst3r21> or is that only for cookies
[06:09:58] <hayalet> Jagst3r21: as far as i know EU cookie policy affects everything that acts like cookies so local storage too
[06:10:09] <Jagst3r21> I am from the US though
[06:10:22] <Jagst3r21> I thought it was only for EU based sites
[06:10:59] <Jagst3r21> I think as long as it is noted in terms of service it is fine (?)
[06:12:34] <hayalet> Jagst3r21: Well, I'm not an expert in policies, but too much information given to user about cookies/localStorage/anything in this case isn't that bad, I guess you should google the topic
[06:12:50] <Jagst3r21> ok, thank you sir
[06:12:53] <Jagst3r21> and thanks for the code
[06:13:10] <Jagst3r21> i see what i was doing wrong, maybe too little sleep because that was not that hard xD

[07:24:53] <Guest90610> hi
[07:26:59] <Guest90610> I want to addClass to a div according to a programatic condidtion. how can I do that? http://pastie.org/8537502
[07:43:29] <bigbugjava> Hi, I call database and getting an object from there, the object is array of objects, and each one has inside (arrive: "yes" fsname: "dagi"no_arrive_reason: "whatever" number: "2"). I want to add these details to DataTable, cant succeed doing so with www.datatables.net site, anyone has an example on how to do so?, thanks ahead
[08:01:14] <bigbugjava> anyone datatable help?!
[08:12:22] <Absolute0> I am binding input and change events to my fields but only the change seems to register: http://pastie.org/8537594
[08:12:55] <shoky> Absolute0: remove the comma between the event names
[08:13:01] <Absolute0> ah, spanks!
[08:13:23] <ravenzz> and cache that $(this)
[08:13:32] <Absolute0> that this biatch
[08:13:40] <Absolute0> :P
[08:13:40] <ravenzz> move that bus
[08:13:41] <ravenzz> !
[08:14:02] <Absolute0> are $() calls expensive?
[08:14:46] <ravenzz> well you either query the dom or create a new jQuery object
[08:15:06] <ravenzz> so yes, expecially in the first case
[08:15:35] <Absolute0> Is "$this" the conventional variable to which you assign $(this)?
[08:15:42] <Absolute0> *variable name
[08:16:05] <shoky> depends whose convention
[08:16:11] <ravenzz> it is up to you
[08:16:14] <Absolute0> I've seen it used a few times
[08:16:22] <Absolute0> seems like a nice way to name it.
[08:17:31] <shoky> it's not used in the jquery source code for example
[08:17:50] <Absolute0> "this" would be the worse possible var you could use
[08:17:53] <ravenzz> it is like self vs that
[08:17:55] <Absolute0> on the other hand
[08:17:56] <ravenzz> who cares man
[08:18:10] <Absolute0> true dat
[08:18:23] <ravenzz> you wouldn't use this eh
[08:19:14] <ravenzz> I mean you can't
[08:19:32] <Absolute0> var this = $(this)?
[08:19:44] <shoky> can't
[08:19:48] <Absolute0> var this = "";
[08:19:48] <Absolute0> SyntaxError: Unexpected token this
[08:19:50] <Absolute0> correct
[08:20:03] <Absolute0> this = ""
[08:20:04] <Absolute0> ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment

[08:30:00] <atoll> I have a very strange bug in a btn-group. The first button has an id="taille-32" and $("#taille-32") gives undefined while the second button has id="taille-34" and $("#taille-34") gives correct object. Any idea how that would even be possible ?
[08:34:26] <atoll> this is officially the strangest bug i've ever met
[08:36:19] <bigbugjava> atoll show example, might be able to help
[08:36:41] <atoll> K i've solved it, there was a space that was introduced in the database that was in the id that i didn't see
[09:30:27] <Guest90610> the .parents(".someClass")  gives us the parent in any level of heirarchy for a child. but does .children do the same?
[09:30:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you there
[09:30:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> wanted to talk to you about <select> elements
[09:31:33] <lietu> Guest90610: try .find
[09:32:02] <Guest90610> lietu,   like for example?
[09:32:17] <lietu> err .. like .find(".someClass")
[09:32:27] <lietu> $('body').find('.someClass')
[09:32:51] <Guest90610> lietu,  this will find all the childres and subchildren of body?
[09:33:03] <lietu> .. with the class someClass, yes
[09:33:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> lietu: are you sure Guest90610 did not mean direct children?
[09:33:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[09:33:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> he wanted grandchildren as well
[09:33:36] <Guest90610> Rohan_Bhangui,  ya. I didnt meant direct children
[09:33:36] <lietu> Rohan_Bhangui: no, but what he said was "any level of hierarchy"
[09:33:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> carry on :)
[09:33:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya .find is the way to go
[09:34:01] <Guest90610> yes. Rohan_Bhangui  wanted grands . any way else than find too?
[09:34:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> but if he is doing for body
[09:34:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> wouldnt it be better for him to do
[09:34:13] <Guest90610> Rohan_Bhangui,  no, iam doing for some other div
[09:34:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("body .someClass")
[09:34:48] <lietu> Rohan_Bhangui: well that was a stupid hypothetical example, you would really never include body in that selector
[09:34:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> true but none the less
[09:35:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lietu: im just using your exmaple
[09:35:12] <lietu> depends on if you know the selector or not
[09:35:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[09:35:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[09:35:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> but if its like $(this.parent()
[09:35:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> then yes .find
[09:35:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> *$(this).parent()
[09:37:55] <Guest90610>  $("body .someClass") will do same as .find?
[09:57:53] <sunbeam> how do I toggle changing a content of a span to - and + ?
[09:59:50] <pixelpimp> .text('-') for one instance, .text('+') for the other.  And an if to decide which to use.
[10:00:06] <limpc> hmm how do i attach a variable to an object, like for example, I have a mouseover event for showing a menu, and need to attach a timer handle to close the menu after a delay on mouseleave.  I need the handle so I can cancel it if the user moves the mouse back into the menu before the timer executes
[10:00:14] <pixelpimp> You can either read the previous .text() of the element, or store a variable and flip it based on that.
[10:00:37] <limpc> (there's like 50 items with their own menus, so I cant just do var myHandle... )
[10:01:01] <sunbeam> pixelpimp: yes
[10:01:03] <sunbeam> correct
[10:01:09] <sunbeam> but isn't it possible to do with toggle?
[10:01:50] <pixelpimp> !api jquery.toggle
[10:01:50] <b-ot> pixelpimp: No matches.
[10:01:54] <pixelpimp> !api toggle
[10:01:55] <b-ot> pixelpimp: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:02:01] <pixelpimp> Not exactly what you need.
[10:02:39] <pixelpimp> If you want a CSS solution and a one-liner for JS, you can toggle a class
[10:02:45] <pixelpimp> !api toggleclass @ sunbeam
[10:02:45] <b-ot> sunbeam: .toggleClass(): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[10:03:31] <pixelpimp> Then use `span:after { content: '-'; } span.plus:after { content: '+'; }` and toggle .plus
[10:11:49] <sunbeam> thanks pixelpimp
[10:33:06] <onosendi> Say I have a list of data, and each item has multiple forms. What's the best method to populate the forms based on the item? For instance, say it was a list of users, and I could click an 'edit' button, and a form would drop down with the users data. Should this be done with javascript, or actually put the form in the loop of data, resulting in a shitload of forms.
[10:46:24] <ravenzz> onosendi each edit link should link to the edit page, then you can enhance it with js ie have a shared form I guess
[10:55:11] <Lewix> Is it correct https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c8fc497af75c10304b37

[11:17:43] <Guest67292> can someone help with this problem? it works with one element, but when you add multiple elements, it keeps creating new timers instead of clearing the preceding one. http://jsfiddle.net/5BrpM/

[11:49:16] <marks-c1> would anyone know  any common occurrences why ajax would not redirect to a location? Im getting the correct echo statement back, but not redirecting when it matches the result...

[12:08:44] <Rashad> Hello.
[12:09:19] <JesperA> _Yeah hi
[12:10:35] <Rashad> I am trying to do this: $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "chat.html" });
[12:10:36] <Rashad> But I get: POST http://localhost:3000/chat.html 404 (Not Found)
[12:10:38] <Rashad> Is this because I am testing on localhost? or is there something wrong with my http server? or is it some other thing?
[12:11:05] <MarkyC> Rashad: Does localhost:3000/chat.html exist?
[12:11:09] <Rashad> Yeah.
[12:11:21] <Rashad> And I can access it from the browser with no problems.
[12:11:59] <marks-c1> limpc can I not do a window.location on success?
[12:12:37] <limpc> sure, you can. but you're talking about ajax not window.location
[12:12:45] <limpc> marks-c1: post a jsfiddle
[12:13:04] <Rashad> Ok I accessed my website from my IP address instead of localhost, and I still get the same problem.
[12:13:37] <Rashad> But now it looks like this: POST http://xx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000/chat.html 404 (Not Found)
[12:15:25] <Rashad> I am using node.js as the server btw.
[12:16:40] <shoky> Rashad: your server is responding to a GET but not a POST, it seems
[12:17:16] <Rashad> Yeah I just tried GET and I got no errors.
[12:17:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: the only way to do the custom select is via js using preferably .map method
[12:17:52] <Rashad> However shouldn't GET load chat.html? The page doesn't change when I try GET.
[12:18:04] <shoky> ajax doesn't change the page
[12:18:52] <Rashad> It only brings the data?
[12:19:05] <shoky> it sends a request and receives a response
[12:19:11] <shoky> nothing more
[12:19:14] <Rashad> Aha.
[12:20:04] <MarkyC> LDawg: Your get request is failing: http://jsfiddle.net/2GAJb/2/
[12:26:11] <LDawg> markyC the problem is not the request but the response object I get from it. (that was just pseudocode). I get a HTMLDocument, but what can Jquery do with that?
[12:30:54] <shoky> LDawg:  var html = $('<div>').append( $.parseHTML(response) );   html.find('#container')...
[12:31:25] <shoky> LDawg: but be aware that it's not a good idea to try parsing a full html page.  small snippets (something that can go into a div) are best
[12:32:22] <shoky> LDawg:  oh if you have an HTMLDocument  you can just do  $(html).find(...)
[12:32:26] <LDawg> its for a chrome extension. I need to parse a whole page and get a div out of it
[12:35:01] <shoky> ok well, just know it's the browser doing the parsing. and it can parse out some tags like <html>  and maybe other unexpected shit thats in a full page
[12:35:11] <shoky> jquery's not an html parser
[12:37:25] <tw2113> can jquery make me coffee yet shoky ?
[12:38:41] <DelphiWorld> hi jqueryists
[12:39:14] <daGrevis> Hi! It would be great if could take a look at my problem and try to help me! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20458585/add-item-to-input-programmatically It's about selectize.js.
[12:40:20] <shoky> tw2113 definitely better than i can make it
[12:41:08] <LDawg> i do with jquery with i want lol
[12:41:09] <tw2113> totally ruined my plan to say "ugh, what's even the point then?" :D
[12:41:35] <tw2113> LDawg, do you hammer in nails with a screwdriver too?
[12:42:00] <LDawg> if i have no hammer, yes
[12:42:14] <tw2113> when you do have a hammer?
[12:42:58] <shoky> then everything looks like a tw2113 waiting for me to smash it
[12:43:23] <shoky> er that was not supposed to be out loud
[12:43:43] <tw2113> don't worry, i won't tell him shoky
[12:44:01] <shoky> you made me chuckle. i'll murder you
[12:44:12] <DelphiWorld> lol
[12:44:31] <tw2113> i'm already dead on the inside, why not go full circle
[12:44:41] <shoky> i'll get dizzy
[12:45:01] <tw2113> to quote the song that's currently playing
[12:45:09] <tw2113> Is this what I get for loving you?
[12:46:04] <shoky> you win
[12:51:47] <tw2113> is this the world we live in? where love is a game you win?
[12:53:03] <soee_> how can i find all lists (ul) with class .foo inside container and apply some class to them or do some animation ?
[12:53:17] <abjorn> tw2113: yes.
[12:53:23] <Lewix> MarkyC: yes
[12:53:35] <shoky> yes
[12:53:39] <tw2113> $('.container ul.foo').addClass('bar');
[12:54:02] <tw2113> my selector may be a bit much, but you get the idea
[12:54:09] <tw2113> gotta go
[12:54:09] <abjorn> $('#truelove').length === 0; // true
[12:54:11] <abjorn> :'(
[12:54:29] <MarkyC> Lewix: I haven't tested it, but I'm going to assume your code won't work with those quotes. I'd suggest not using Word as an IDE. Try Notepad++, or even just regular old Windows Notepad
[12:56:15] <Lewix> MarkyC: MarkyC, i wont use the quotes just the after solution. I just wanna have an idea if there's a better way to solve this
[12:58:39] <MarkyC> Lewix: You're pretty close. Remember that dynamic_content is an ID, and IDs are prefixed with a hash in jQuery/CSS selectors-> #dynamic_content
[12:59:21] <soee_> if i have class like: menu-level-1, menu-level-2 etc. can i selec all elements vhere the level number is greater than 1 ?
[12:59:26] <MarkyC> Also, I'm not too sure event.preventDefault() does anything in that context. I don't see where an event variable would have been created.
[13:00:16] <Lewix> MarkyC: thanks. everytime i use jquery i miss a little detail like that
[13:00:54] <Lewix> MarkyC: well, in the situation a default event has been set somewhere in the code
[13:02:28] <funkwarrior> hi all, I'm struggling with a multiple selection of data attributes using filter
[13:03:57] <marks-c1> anyone good with ajax?
[13:04:31] <shoky> `ask @ marks-c1
[13:04:31] <b-ot> marks-c1: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:05:24] <marks-c1> sorry shoky, why would ajax be posting into the url bar and not post to the direct php file?
[13:05:28] <dainbrain> derp
[13:05:38] <marks-c1> no console errors
[13:05:52] <shoky> marks-c1: hmm? what do you mean, exactly
[13:06:16] <shoky> ajax doesn't touch the url bar or the current url
[13:06:31] <shoky> unless you put some code that does it in the ajax callback
[13:06:56] <marks-c1> http://jsfiddle.net/gXrca/12/ that the bin, it originally wasn't posting to the url bar, and i was getting the returned statement from the php file that I was echoing but now I'm not even getting that
[13:07:14] <marks-c1> nothing to tell me whats happening
[13:07:37] <shoky> first of all, add an error handler to the ajax request
[13:07:55] <marks-c1> ok
[13:08:11] <shoky> see if you're getting an error. 2nd, check your browser's devtools network tab and look at the request/response to see if it's what's expected
[13:08:38] <shoky> oh
[13:08:38] <marks-c1> ok
[13:09:02] <shoky> also uncomment the e.preventDefault() and add e as an argument to the event callback
[13:09:04] <srruby> Is it better to select via class or name ? I have a bunch of select tags that I need to attach behaviour to via .change . What is the best practice ? Thanks, John
[13:09:14] <shoky> marks-c1: and handle the form's submit, not the button's click
[13:09:55] <marks-c1> right ok, ill still put in the error handler too
[13:10:11] <marks-c1> ill give that a try shoky
[13:13:57] <shoky> marks-c1: and you might wanna $.trim the response otherwise the newlines from your php will also be in it

[13:22:57] <funkwarrior> Hello, I'm struggling with my filter function in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Funkwarrior/TA87x/4/
[13:23:51] <funkwarrior> I can show only the items with exact single filter data, not the items containing the filter data and others… any suggestion? http://jsfiddle.net/Funkwarrior/TA87x/4/
[13:32:26] <dainbrain> haven a strange issue that's hard to track down... $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight(); is working fine in browser (chrome safari) but not in fullscreen iOS web app
[13:33:12] <dainbrain> about to stab myself in the eye with something
[13:54:39] <jax1> hello
[13:55:01] <jax1> i got something like this: <td><form…></form></td> <td><button></td> how can i get <form> when clicking on button? want to submit it
[13:56:17] <tw2113> add an ID to the form, use that for your selector?
[13:57:26] <Jax> ah got it $(this).closest('td').prev('td').find('form').submit();
[13:58:46] <tw2113> sounds like a lot of work for something that'd likely have an ID already
[14:00:17] <dainbrain> or if not an id at least an action/method attribute
[14:00:56] <puchacz> hi, why would NOT something like $('this').attr('src', '/static5/app/mlt/mva-icons/up8x8-highlight.png'); work please?
[14:01:04] <puchacz> I put a breakpoint and this line is executed
[14:01:18] <puchacz> it is in hover(first_function,...) on image
[14:01:40] <shoky> puchacz: $(this)  not  $('this')
[14:01:54] <puchacz> shoky - of course, thanks!
[14:02:04] <puchacz> btw - is illuminations worth getting?
[14:07:09] <Tomashe> Hey guys i got some issue with jquery countdown and IE which i think the issue is something between the jquery and the ie

[14:33:50] <OveRRide> Hey guys, lets say you have animate loop running on multiple elements with unique ids but the same class. you are animating them by class… '.claassname' … everything is going fine unitl i .remove() one of the elements by its unique id… then all the other animations which i expect to remain unchanged… stop
[14:34:20] <OveRRide> is this normal jquery behavior? is there some workaround i can implement?

[15:24:33] <sunbeam> when the users opens the site this div serves as the background of all content
[15:24:43] <sunbeam> when the user starts scrolling I want this div to scroll into another image
[15:24:45] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[16:54:44] <sahilsk> Hi, i've a huge chunk of data continously coming through ajax from backend. what would be the best way to show it on front-end?
[16:55:59] <sahilsk> Hi, i've a huge chunk of data continously coming through ajax from backend. what would be the best way to show it on front-end?  Data is huge so, if do $("#textFiled").val() + newData, then i afraid later it cna run out of memory or may slow down clietn browser as textField at some point in time will contain huge data in itself. coping and replacing it all will slow down the browser
[16:56:39] <grafi> sounds like you shouldnt do that then :P
[17:08:35] <james948> hi there. Is anyone available to troubleshoot an issue I'm having with jquery but only in iOS Safari, iOS Chrome and Safari 7.
[17:08:55] <Velveeta> safari 7? holy crap
[17:09:01] <Velveeta> you stay on the bleeding edge
[17:09:11] <james948> Halala.
[17:09:13] <james948> CRAZY HERE>
[17:09:16] <james948> on this bleeding edge!
[17:09:41] <Velveeta> so what's the problem? i may not be able to help, in my inebriated state, but i can sure try!
[17:09:51] <james948> Wonderful :)
[17:09:56] <james948> http://box.james-veitch.com/this-weeks-menu/
[17:10:07] <james948> run the slider back and forth a few times;
[17:10:17] <james948> it breaks on the second or third try on saf 7 et al.
[17:10:33] <Velveeta> looks tasty enough
[17:10:33] <Velveeta> ok
[17:10:35] <james948> I've tried everything
[17:10:55] <Velveeta> i guess i should try to shrink my browser to the size of a tablet browser
[17:10:57] <james948> :)
[17:11:05] <james948> It breaks in normal size too.
[17:11:07] <Velveeta> nice responsiveness, btw
[17:11:10] <james948> :)
[17:11:14] <james948> it's a theme I've customised.
[17:11:16] <Velveeta> well i have no scrollbar in normal size
[17:11:43] <james948> I'm not much of a coder; just css, html really so someone else made this for me but can't work out what is wrong and since he doesn't have a mac or iPhone he claims he can't work out wha'ts wrong.
[17:11:55] <james948> there's an arrow on the right
[17:11:58] <james948> in the middle.
[17:12:16] <Velveeta> gotcha
[17:12:28] <james948> breaking for you now?
[17:13:02] <Velveeta> so i'm in mac/chrome, which is apparently working fine
[17:13:13] <Velveeta> however, i have an ios7 emulator, let me get it spawned up
[17:13:16] <james948> yes.
[17:13:24] <james948> fine in chrome.
[17:13:28] <james948> busted in safari on the mac too.
[17:13:48] <james948> if you have the latest version of safari desktop it is broken there too.
[17:14:28] <Velveeta> hold on, kfc commercial + alcohol
[17:14:42] <Velveeta> j/k, loading xcode so i can spin up my emulator
[17:14:50] <james948> ah. the ultimate combo!
[17:14:52] <james948> awesome.
[17:15:11] <james948> have you tried it in regular old safari on your mac though?
[17:15:19] <Velveeta> though i do quite literally have to remember how to launch the emulator
[17:15:19] <james948> It should be broken there though too.
[17:15:25] <Velveeta> my safari isn't 7
[17:15:31] <Velveeta> but i can try it anyway
[17:15:39] <james948> Ah. i think it works in previous versions.
[17:15:53] <Velveeta> yeah i'm 6.0.5
[17:17:17] <Velveeta> yeah, works fine on my safari, one minute, to the googlez
[17:17:33] <james948> : )
[17:19:11] <Velveeta> BOOM, i figured it out, suck that, apple
[17:19:22] <james948> REALLY?
[17:19:28] <james948> You figured out what the problem was?
[17:19:28] <Velveeta> not your problem
[17:19:32] <james948> DAMN
[17:19:34] <Velveeta> just how to get my ios simulator launched
[17:19:35] <james948> :)
[17:19:38] <Velveeta> :D
[17:19:39] <james948> haha. Ok.
[17:20:38] <hendry> if I have a JSON file that I need to render some HTML out of, would I use some other templating engine typically to do that?
[17:20:44] <Velveeta> ok, i can confirm the issue at least
[17:20:49] <james948> Phew!
[17:20:51] <james948> Good news.
[17:20:53] <james948> Step 1.
[17:20:54] <james948> of 800
[17:20:56] <Velveeta> rightio
[17:21:14] <Velveeta> hendry: i would definitely advocate using a client-side templating engine, yes
[17:22:51] * Velveeta rages into a Hulk body as he watches some fantasy football options come to life that he neglected to pick up on.
[17:22:54] <hendry> Velveeta: what would that be? I think people mention ember js to me
[17:23:30] <Velveeta> hendry: ember is more than a client-side templating library, it's more of a front-end development stack.. you want to look into something like mustache or handlebars or dust js
[17:23:58] <Velveeta> james948: downloading a safari nightly build so i can attach a debugger to my ios7 emulator
[17:24:07] <Velveeta> i had one already, but not sure where i left it on disk
[17:24:09] <james948> WOW>
[17:24:11] <james948> thanks!
[17:24:58] <bongjovi> Could anyone recommend a simple jquery slider (with touch support preferably)?
[17:25:26] <james948> Before I came on here I posted on the forum and jakecigar just wrote the following (if it's helpful) "One big difference in webkit browsers is that the "ready" event occurs more quickly than other browsers. In other browsers the images are loaded. In webkit browsers they are not.   I assume your code works in firefox and IE.  You can try using $(window).load( instead of $(document).ready( or you can make sure your images have defined 
[17:29:05] <hendry> Velveeta: not sure how to integrate mustache and jquery. I also need URLs like ?id=f79602aca880fb54-f65945357u119345 to do different views in my Web app
[17:29:47] <Velveeta> hendry: if you want to do view-handling based on url, then you need something bigger than just a client-side tempating library, which might be why someone recommended ember to you
[17:34:41] <Velveeta> also, james948: i don't know that i buy into that theory about .load vs. .ready
[17:34:47] <Velveeta> but i'm exploring, so i may be wrong
[17:35:04] <james948> ok. Np.
[17:35:16] <james948> i'm james948 on Skype if login to the wp install helps.
[17:36:18] <Velveeta> my guess is that the wp login will be unnecessary, it'll probably just be some kind of display quirk, but who knows
[17:38:11] <james948> What can I do about it?
[17:38:54] <freebirD2> you guys, I'm loading a div down, like this: $(".message_box").slideDown("slow");
[17:39:14] <freebirD2> after that I would like to scroll hte page down using anchor, please, help
[17:39:23] <freebirD2> with js, page goes only until the middle of the way
[17:45:29] <james948> Are you still working on it velveeta?
[17:45:31] <james948> (sorry)
[17:45:48] <Velveeta> james948: yep, it's during football, so i'm distracted, but yes, i am still looking into this
[17:46:22] <james948> haha. Ok. Thanks !
[17:50:46] <freebirD2> please, how do I scroll to the end of a page, there's an anchor in there, using jquery please ? I'm trying like this: $(document).scrollTop( $("#down").offset().top );
[17:50:48] <freebirD2> wont work
[17:55:19] <Velveeta> <still looking> @james948
[17:55:40] <freebirD2> get it
[17:55:43] <freebirD2> $("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: $(document).height()});
[17:55:51] <Velveeta> freebird2: just put a named anchor on the section of the page you're trying to scroll to, and programmatically trigger the click on it?
[17:56:11] <Velveeta> i don't know if that'll actually work, but it seems easier than trying to screw with scrollTop
[17:58:44] <james948> Och I've got to go to sleep; it's 2am here.
[17:58:52] <Velveeta> yowza
[17:58:55] <james948> thanks so much for trying velveeta
[17:59:00] <Velveeta> i can't find anything obvious
[17:59:01] <Velveeta> just fyi
[17:59:14] <james948> thanks anyway. I'll drop by tomorrow morning and see who's around.
[17:59:33] <Velveeta> sounds good, i'll be in the office by then
[17:59:40] <Velveeta> if i find anything by then i'll let you know
[18:03:56] <Promess> howdy, would anyone be able to assist me with some questions i have?
[18:04:42] <Promess> I'm attempting to push some ajax for a vote option that has to compile a list of variables from different fields. I'm not quite sure how to do it though.
[18:06:02] <shoky> and the questions are?
[18:06:52] <Promess> i'm doing a request from a third party api that has a list of items that i've parsed through and selected the ones that I want to in my database right?
[18:07:53] <Promess> i want the data to be hidden from on the page being viewed, but I need that response to be then submitted via ajax to my php which will then handle it
[18:08:21] <Promess> what is the best way to store, and subsequently, push that ajax out?
[18:08:54] <Promess> i've assigned an id of the row that matches option
[18:09:56] <kansai> hi folks , does sedo parking pay for xxx domain ? if they pay how much for how many hit for ??
[18:11:14] <shoky> Promess: didn't really understand what you're doing, or your question
[18:11:26] <shoky> paste your code somewhere
[18:12:53] <Velveeta> kansai: please rephrase your question in the form of something jquery'ish
[18:13:17] <Promess> shoky http://pastebin.com/H27UUUnE
[18:13:52] <Velveeta> promess: jsfiddle is preferable to pastebin, as it's interactive and allows us to actually muck w/ the code
[18:13:59] <Promess> ah k
[18:14:03] <Promess> i'll do it there, sorry
[18:14:07] <Velveeta> no problemo
[18:14:19] <Velveeta> pastebin is just read-only, jsfiddle is easier for us to get elbows-deep in :)
[18:16:13] <shoky> Promess:  "action=addSong&"+$(this).attr("id")    you didn't give a name to the id param
[18:16:34] <Promess> http://jsfiddle.net/7Mkd7/
[18:16:49] <Promess> yeah, i'm kind of confused about how to move foward from here actually
[18:16:50] <Velveeta> and then there are people like shoky, who can diagnose your problem on the more sober end of the world
[18:17:10] <shoky> jsfiddle won't help much with mostly php  code ;p
[18:17:30] <Velveeta> right, i noticed that after i posted my request for a fiddle
[18:17:40] <Velveeta> and then started reading through it, and then mostly gave up :)
[18:17:44] <shoky> heh
[18:17:47] <Promess> if you notice, right now I have it in 3 different fields, I think I will be precompiling the data from there.
[18:17:55] <Velveeta> i figured i'd see where his fiddle wound up at w/ regards to the php code
[18:18:12] <Promess> yeah, sorry about the cluster f
[18:18:36] <shoky> Promess: another thing.. id's in html must be unique
[18:18:42] <shoky> if they're not, you're doing it wrong
[18:18:46] <Promess> they're unique
[18:18:52] <shoky> no
[18:19:04] <Promess> there's no id 0-9 as an int
[18:19:08] <shoky> your 3 inputs have the same id
[18:19:15] <shoky> id="<?php echo $id; ?>"
[18:19:16] <Promess> oh, right
[18:19:23] <Promess> so, that's kind of my question, right?
[18:19:47] <Promess> i need all 3 to be submitted in a json object to my php
[18:19:59] <Velveeta> so form submission doesn't rely on the id attributes
[18:20:04] <Promess> no
[18:20:11] <Velveeta> but if you're making your field names based on the same field, that could be problematic
[18:20:19] <Promess> yeah
[18:20:30] <Promess> that's why i'm here asking! :D
[18:20:38] <Velveeta> :)
[18:20:44] <Velveeta> let me take another look
[18:20:54] <Promess> my problem is i don't know how to differentiate them when they each have different values. i need each one w/ the same id, but i want their values to be submitted
[18:21:31] <Promess> the s.php is going to validate them, and then insert them into the db
[18:21:53] <Velveeta> so i see you reusing the $id field for the id="" attribute, but the values are all pulled from different pieces of data, e.g. $title, $duration, $url
[18:22:05] <Promess> yes! :D
[18:22:11] <Velveeta> however, you're iterating over $xml->track, how many of those records are there?
[18:22:12] <Promess> i couldn't think of a better way to do that
[18:22:18] <Promess> 50
[18:22:22] <Velveeta> oh boy
[18:22:32] <Velveeta> ok, then you'll probably want to do something like this
[18:22:41] <Promess> and i don't know js enough to do squat
[18:22:53] <Promess> i'm making up for a classmates failure to do this project that's due tuesday
[18:23:05] <Velveeta> name="songtitle[<?php echo $id; ?>]" value="<?php echo $title; ?>"
[18:23:10] <Promess> and i'm in the last 20% but this and my voting system will be the more challenging
[18:23:31] <Promess> is the entering each into an input field the easiest way to do it?
[18:23:33] <Velveeta> name="duration[<?php echo $id; ?>] value="<?php echo $duration; ?>" etc
[18:24:04] <Velveeta> so what that will do is make each of your values an array, keyed by the $id value
[18:24:18] <Velveeta> so you'll have type[$id][$propertyName]
[18:24:30] <Velveeta> e.g. duration[record48]['duration']
[18:24:47] <Velveeta> so that way you can identify each unique record, and each property of that unique record
[18:25:20] <shoky> looking at his click handler
[18:25:36] <shoky> it seems he wants only the 3 inputs next to the div he clicked
[18:25:39] <shoky> Promess is that right
[18:25:46] <Promess> exactly correct shoky
[18:26:06] <shoky> if so.. and if you really want json, can try smth like:   $('div.addmusic').click(function() { var obj = {}; $(this).siblings('form').find('input').each(function() { obj[this.name] = this.value }); $.ajax({..., contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify(obj) }); });
[18:26:18] <shoky> er that's long.
[18:26:24] <tordh> hi all
[18:26:49] <shoky> Promess: and remove all those id's
[18:27:40] <Promess> hrm
[18:28:25] <Promess> i'm not really seeing it shoky, how does that work?
[18:28:48] <shoky> $(this).siblings('form').find
[18:28:58] <shoky> $(this).siblings('form').find('input')   finds the 3 inputs next to the clicked div
[18:29:20] <shoky> i loop over them and for each one create a key:value in the empty obj object
[18:29:30] <shoky> and then send that as json data
[18:29:52] <Promess> nice
[18:29:54] <Promess> i see it now
[18:29:58] <Promess> great explanation btw
[18:30:05] <Promess> dang man
[18:30:10] <Promess> and remove the ids?
[18:30:20] <Promess> do you think that's the best way to do it?
[18:30:27] <shoky> well
[18:30:31] <tordh> does someone have a minute for a complete nooby script kid?
[18:30:42] <shoky> probably there's no need for those hidden inputs.
[18:30:45] <Promess> stand in line tordh :P
[18:30:56] <Promess> how should i hide the data while keeping it there then?
[18:31:00] <tordh> ok Promess
[18:31:12] <shoky> Promess: i'd put that data as data-xxx attributes on the <div class="track"> element
[18:31:20] <tordh> <- standing in line
[18:31:27] <Velveeta> tordh: go ahead and throw your question out
[18:31:34] <shoky> and then access it from the click handler like:  $(this).closest('.track').data('songtitle')
[18:32:11] <shoky> or if you want it can just be on the .addmusic div itself, doesn't matter
[18:32:24] <shoky> (.closest searches up the dom)
[18:32:37] <Promess> can i im you shoky?
[18:32:47] <shoky> no good here?
[18:33:04] <shoky> i gotta go take a shower anyway
[18:33:08] <Promess> ah
[18:33:10] <Promess> uhh
[18:33:14] <shoky> you're in good hands with Velveeta  tho
[18:33:16] <Promess> i think i understand what you're talking about
[18:33:17] <tordh> well, how do I add a function to a html script? I'm calling a jQuery script via <a href="#kontakt" rel="m_PageScroll2id"> and would like to add more functions to it
[18:33:44] <Promess> so you would do <div data-duration="555555" data-title="XXXXX", and then grab each data field?
[18:34:38] <shoky> yes. can also do   var data = $(this).closest('.track').data();  then access data.duration  data.title  etc
[18:35:15] <Promess> wow nuts
[18:35:16] <Promess> cool
[18:35:20] <Promess> thank you so much shoky
[18:35:23] <Promess> u da bes
[18:35:43] <shoky> ;]
[18:37:40] <Velveeta> tordh: not sure what you're asking.. just how to add page-level javascript to be executed?
[18:42:23] <tordh> no
[18:42:30] <tordh> ok worth a try¨
[19:11:49] <Cache_Money> I have 2 divs, each with a <button class="once">Once</button>.  I only want to allow the user to click each button once.  How would I do this?
[19:11:57] <slick-> guys
[19:12:09] <slick-> i can honestly say
[19:12:11] <slick-> without this channel
[19:12:16] <slick-> i would no thave been able to start my business
[19:12:18] <slick-> in web dev
[19:12:24] <slick-> also #php
[19:13:49] <Cache_Money> Do I need to give each button an id and create two separate event handlers?
[19:22:12] <grafi> just disable the button after it has been pressed?
[19:53:50] <nahtnam> Hey, i need help with affix
[19:53:53] <nahtnam> I am using affix but the sidebar keeps on scrunching
[20:02:43] <grafi> nahtnam show code
[20:06:08] <nahtnam> grafi: http://pastie.org/private/fecz7nylkvhnuclxlwumw
[20:14:21] <EvilEpoch> Greetings to all, I am The EvilEpoch.
[20:14:57] <nahtnam> Welcome EvilEpoch
[20:15:20] <EvilEpoch> The EvilEpoch is having difficulties with selecting a particular item on the DOM.
[20:18:33] <EvilEpoch> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/43aee7d21e0904dfb327 That is the code
[20:18:54] <EvilEpoch> The EvilEpoch is trying to select that first div right in the li
[20:19:07] <EvilEpoch> after the delete icon has been clicked but cant seem to get it
[20:19:17] <EvilEpoch> either get undefined or can only get the immediate parent
[20:20:53] <EvilEpoch> grr The EvilEpoch thinks he knows... needs to probably get the parent LI then the first child div
[20:27:05] <rainabba> Using just jQuery (not plugins), what's the most direct way to populate a SELECT with OPTIONs given a JS array of options?
[20:29:26] <EvilEpoch> Yep The EvilEpoch got it
[20:29:27] <EvilEpoch> thanks guys
[20:32:34] <Snowleaksange> hmm is there any generic way to add rows to table, regardless if there are no rows in the table, some rows, or want to add last row?
[20:35:40] <Gazpacho> the generic way is to insert tr elements where you want them, otherwise i'm not sure what you're asking
[20:38:17] <Snowleaksange> i dont thin nth-child works when theres no children.  so if empty i have to select table and use append.  if there are rows that i can select nth row and use before/after
[20:38:29] <Snowleaksange> but i just found an unrelated bug that is confusing matters brb
[20:42:25] <echosystm> $(document).on('tap', 'a', function() { ... })
[20:42:32] <echosystm> the function never gets called
[20:42:36] <echosystm> on my phone
[20:42:46] <echosystm> changing tap to "touch" makes no difference
[20:42:49] <echosystm> what's going on?
[20:49:47] <Gazpacho> is there a jquery plugin for making ham
[20:49:51] <Gazpacho> i want ham on my web page
[20:52:28] <Gazpacho> snow: just write an insertAt function that does the empty check and use it everywhere
[21:06:30] <Promess> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=KFrP8Gyxfb
[21:08:49] <Promess> any ideas? i saw someone join it
[22:05:59] <Cache_Money> Is it possible to tell what the zoom level of the browser is?
[22:53:58] <Promess> which is better .ajax or .post?
[23:01:30] <pixelpimp> yes.
[23:19:12] <Cork> Promess: it is basically the same thing
[23:19:33] <Cork> Promess: .post is a short hand for .ajax
[23:50:06] <Promess> how can i append a new bit to a multidemensional array?
[23:52:14] <Cork> Promess: arr.push()
[23:54:38] <Promess> so i have an array ('event'=> test,'stuff'=>doing) and i want to append another array ('what'=>thefuck), i've tried using push, i've tried creating a new array called and doing a.push(b) and it still doesn't work
[23:54:42] <Promess> any suggestions cork?
[23:54:53] <Cork> that's not an array
[23:55:01] <Cork> that's not even js
[23:55:40] <Promess> err lol it's the print_r from php that i returned testing ajax, sorry, var data = $(this).closest('.plus').data();
[23:56:11] <Cork> Promess: arrays are [data,data,data,data]
[23:56:33] <Promess> i'm trying to append one more to that
[23:56:41] <Cork> what php calls arrays are often objects (or hashes in other languages)
[23:56:50] <Promess> yeah
[23:57:09] <Promess> sorry, that was just the alert of the response i get back from php which i intended to show me what the output looked like
[23:57:13] <Cork> well on what level area you trying to modify it?
[23:57:40] <Cork> Promess: then you should have shown the json version instead
[23:59:00] <Promess> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=VOcgV5k96k can you suggest how i would append that data that i'm trying to push?
[23:59:21] <Cork> the fiddle is empty
