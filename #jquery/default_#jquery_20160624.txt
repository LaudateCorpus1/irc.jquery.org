[03:58:34] <LeGorille> hi, can any one tell me what the best way to loop inside this json array and populate a select field
[03:58:43] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/podu81Lj/
[04:28:21] <sshawuk> anybody about?
[05:04:31] <LeGorille> hey guys can anyone help
[05:04:34] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/podu81Lj/
[05:04:42] <LeGorille> console says v is null
[05:11:31] <Uhkis> LeGorille: finish the fiddle and ask again.
[05:12:32] <LeGorille> hmmm it is finished
[05:13:08] <LeGorille> the json on top is how option.values looks like
[05:13:30] <Uhkis> all i see is few lines of json
[05:13:58] <LeGorille> yes but they all look the same way
[05:14:27] <LeGorille> ok let me put more data
[05:16:57] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/podu81Lj/1/
[05:17:12] <LeGorille> that's the json for option
[05:34:38] <LeGorille> anyone?
[05:36:04] <Uhkis> still a broken fiddle
[05:37:57] <LeGorille> :) dude, have you even tried to take a look, or you simply analyzed how good looking the fiddle is
[05:38:48] <Uhkis> if you're not making an effort, why should i?
[05:38:59] <LeGorille> that all the code I have
[05:39:09] <LeGorille> the json is coming for a ajax script
[05:39:18] <LeGorille> I logged that part and copied it
[05:41:51] <d2k> Hi, I have a very basic random img script inside a function which replaces the css background of a div. I have a running for of this for desktop but somehow the mobile version seems to need if cases  to support img based css assigments because the script works but since the javascript image call can be described as a own image each time it gets loaded such css assigments wont get loaded: background-repeat:no-repeat; background-position
[05:42:05] <LeGorille> this should be better
[05:42:26] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/podu81Lj/2/
[05:42:45] <d2k> sorry i need to paste the text again:
[05:43:35] <d2k> Hi, I have a very basic random img script inside a function which on reload replaces the css background of a div. I have a running script of this for desktop but somehow the mobile version seems to need if cases  to support img based css assigments because the script works but since the javascript image call can be described as a own image each time it gets loaded such css assigments wont get loaded: background-repeat:no-repeat; backgr
[05:43:49] <d2k> background-size:100%  Here is a code snippet: http://dpaste.com/19T6ZA9  ...maybe you can help, thanks in advance!
[05:45:55] <d2k> Note: In the mobile version the image does not appear at all but it gets loaded.
[05:46:30] <d3m0n> Anyone work is DataTables before know if it's possible to pass multiple search keywords and combine the result?
[05:47:39] <d2k> you can use awesomecomplete, it's a tiny and fancy script for placing static keywords which you may insert dynamicly. Just guessing however.
[05:48:26] <Uhkis> LeGorille: so what you're trying to do is add <option>'s to a <select> ?
[05:50:29] <LeGorille> yes
[05:50:48] <LeGorille> but I get this : TypeError: v is null
[05:53:08] <d2k> d3m0n: sorry, I was talking about a keyword suggestion for search-inputs, nvm, please, atm I'm working on a search page but in the frontend so I got confused with your question
[05:53:24] <Uhkis> LeGorille: https://jsfiddle.net/podu81Lj/3/
[05:54:01] <d3m0n> Yeah no worries, I am manually input the search but need to do multiple searchs
[05:54:06] <d3m0n> inputting*
[05:58:31] <d2k> d3m0n: Ok, Hm, no idea, maybe you could show my searchpage to people in order to demonstrate the effect. It has multiple keywords support (basiclly it's opencart)
[06:00:52] <d2k>  /UNIGNORE d3m0n
[06:00:52] <d3m0n> d2k thanks, actually looking at the docs I may be able to create my own regex
[06:02:03] <d2k> d3m0n: I've sent you a PM
[06:26:01] <LeGorille> thanks a lot Uhkis
[06:26:07] <LeGorille> I appreciate your help
[06:34:40] <d2k> I would appreciate any hints and help on my issue, description and instructions for reviewing the issue are inside this snippet: http://dpaste.com/14TMMM2
[06:36:49] <d2k> Right now just for testing I made the basic css background image !important to at least show the first img of the random array
[07:00:06] <kontoo> given a template element in my dom: <template id="my-template"><p>foo</p></template>, why does $("#my-template").children.first() return nothing?
[07:00:18] <kontoo> I expect it to return the <p> element
[07:19:46] <xec> kontoo: maybe .children() instead?
[07:22:28] <decx> what a weird way to use a template
[07:23:05] <taplar_> is <template> a true template?  I didn't think you could do selectors on the internals of a template
[07:24:10] <xec> afaik it's just an element that isn't displayed
[07:24:26] <xec> it should still be part of the DOM
[07:24:59] <decx> gotta be super convenient to use a template but still having to select manually
[07:25:02] <decx> ^^
[07:25:45] <taplar_> come on decx.  its not like he could throw a class on it or anything
[07:25:55] <LeGorille> hey guys, can anyone help with this fiddle:
[07:25:56] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/eyassine/mw7h4j1w/1/
[07:27:12] <decx> in jquerys map the iterator comes first
[07:27:17] <decx> dont ask why
[07:27:36] <xec> LeGorille: $.map returns an array too, not sure if you can feed that directly to .html()
[07:27:44] <decx> also option instead of options
[07:27:47] <decx> also no jquery
[07:27:54] <decx> so lots
[07:28:09] <decx> wait what's with the each
[07:28:15] <decx> even more weird stuff
[07:28:33] <LeGorille> :)
[07:28:37] <LeGorille> really ?
[07:28:41] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/mw7h4j1w/2/
[07:29:19] <taplar_> "disabled: false"
[07:29:22] <taplar_> -_-
[07:29:57] <xec> i also don't know why you're doing [0]
[07:30:16] <decx> right that's pointless too
[07:31:00] <decx> what were you thinking with that wrapper each anyway
[07:33:17] <LeGorille> I was trying to loop inside the options
[07:33:27] <LeGorille> and then populate the select field
[07:33:30] <xec> .map is a loop already
[07:33:34] <xec> so you dont need both
[07:34:12] <decx> yeah but even so you'd set a new html() everytime
[07:37:04] <LeGorille> what do you mean ?
[07:37:20] <LeGorille> I need the options to be reset
[07:41:19] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/mw7h4j1w/5/
[07:43:18] <taplar_> and xec: "The HTML template element <template> is a mechanism for holding client-side content that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded but may subsequently be instantiated during runtime using JavaScript."
[07:43:23] <taplar_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[07:45:20] <kontoo> Lokila__: ah, the link clarifies it. the templates content is not part of the document until activated
[07:45:32] <taplar_> right
[07:48:53] <LeGorille> taplar_ what's handlebar ?
[07:49:01] <LeGorille> handlebars
[07:49:09] <taplar_> it's a templating library
[07:49:26] <taplar_> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[07:51:07] <LeGorille> it's a pretty big file
[07:51:26] <xec> taplar_: yeah, not rendered doesn't mean it won't be in the DOM though
[07:52:08] <taplar_> the template will be in the dom.  the children of it wouldn't be.  they would be accessable with innerHTML or something like that.  That doc talks about it
[07:52:43] <taplar_> LeGorille: 156kb is a large file?
[07:53:32] <LeGorille> :) yes I think so
[07:53:35] <taplar_> minified version is 70kb
[07:53:40] <xec> taplar_: that doc is clearly using .querySelectorAll to find <p> elements inside the template...?
[07:53:52] <xec> sorry, the <td> elements
[07:54:22] <taplar_> t.content.querySelectorAll
[07:54:26] <taplar_> ah, ok
[07:59:11] <xec> taplar_: hmmm. you got a point about the .content property there - like .children() wouldnt find it, you'd have to do [0].content.children or something instead i guess
[07:59:42] <taplar_> unless sizzle checks for that kind of stuff, which iirc it doesn't.  i know i've had issues with templates in the past
[08:00:08] <taplar_> i just always $($(selector).innerHTML) it, heh
[08:00:16] <taplar_> unless i use handlebars
[08:00:51] <taplar_> who doesn't like a templating library that does the looping for you and doesn't use $(), :)
[08:02:28] <xec> taplar_, kontoo: https://jsfiddle.net/utckzwoz/
[08:03:05] <xec> so .children() does not work, like you expected taplar_
[08:34:46] <d2k> I have solved my random img onreload css-bg-img replacement script. I just linked to the wrong path, nvm, please. Thanks a lot!
[08:58:54] <ambro718> Hi. How do I receive the response of a $.ajax request incrementally (plain text response)?
[08:59:27] <taplar_> you don't.  the ajax request executes the success method once the entire response has been received
[09:00:07] <ambro718> you man, there is no way with jquery? I suppose there is a way directly with XMLHttpRequest?
[09:00:22] <taplar_> jquery is using the XMLHttpRequest
[09:00:30] <taplar_> what your after may be something like long polling or websockets
[09:00:33] * taplar_ brb
[09:01:05] <ambro718> no I just need to have the pieces of response data available as they are received by the browser.
[09:04:20] <taplar_> which isn't how ajax works
[09:05:36] <taplar_> it's not even how http works
[09:06:40] <ambro718> pretty sure http doesn't dictate the response must not be looked at until it's completely received
[09:08:17] <taplar_> your server is going to return the response all at once, iirc
[09:08:45] <taplar_> there may be a delay over the line, but your server isn't going to send some, wait a bit, then send more
[09:08:59] <taplar_> it has to know it all, otherwise it can't compute the content-length header
[09:09:16] <ambro718> that's exactly what my server does, actually, my server reads the POSTed content and generates the output from that incrementally ;)
[09:09:37] <ambro718> it's not exactly black magic to do this
[09:10:29] <taplar_> it may create it incrementally, but it should send it all once your done.  but i may be wrong.  been a while since i did any low level socket programming
[09:10:54] <ambro718> I mean I wrote the HTTP server code myself, I damn well know how it works :)
[09:10:59] <gonch> hi, i wonder if you can help me, i have this jquery to deal with a textarea - http://pastebin.com/R1P5xEmz it doesnt disable the button when the remaining chars is less than 0 - any ideas?
[09:11:11] <Macaveli> what is the jquery code that is executed when the window / page is finished loaded at his latest?
[09:11:12] <ambro718> taplar_: it doesn't sent Content-Length but Transfer-Encoding:chunked ...
[09:12:48] <taplar_> ah
[09:12:57] <taplar_> this may be helpful then http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6789703/how-to-write-javascript-in-client-side-to-receive-and-parse-chunked-response-i
[09:14:06] <ambro718> yeah this is helpful, I suspected it must exist :)
[09:14:15] <ambro718> thaks
[09:14:18] <VectorX> whats wrong here, https://jsfiddle.net/eg18d6f8/1/ when i click the "Click here" i get a console error VM327 jquery-1.12.4.js:1502 Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object Object] iframe
[09:14:36] <taplar_> sure.  sorry i wasn't aware of that right off, :(
[09:15:17] <taplar_> Macaveli: document ready will wait for the page to be parsed into the dom.  document on load will wait for the entire page to load, meaning images loaded as well
[09:15:50] <speedio> im trying to make an expandable menu with jquery, but cant figure out why the child li class is not shown .. i created a pen to show my problem.. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rLjWMK , how can i solve this? thanks
[09:16:31] <taplar_> gonch: make a fiddle with the issue if you would
[09:17:29] <gonch> how do i use jquery with a fiddle?
[09:17:56] <taplar_> there is a dropdown in the top right corner of the javascript area, you can choose your version there
[09:18:19] <taplar_> VectorX: modal in your fiddle is an object.  you can't append a string to object for a selector
[09:19:15] <taplar_> VectorX: use find() off of the modal
[09:23:05] <notchris> How to say
[09:23:13] <notchris> Every 6 elements
[09:23:59] <taplar_> speedio: your doing a global lookup for your inner match, not finding the element related to the active one
[09:24:47] <taplar_> $('li.active .sub-menu').first().slideToggle();
[09:25:13] <taplar_> notchris: can you elaborate?
[09:25:23] <gonch> taplar_: https://jsfiddle.net/fg1nfr4e/
[09:26:01] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/fg1nfr4e/1/
[09:27:32] <speedio> taplar_: i saved the pen with your answer but it didnt work :/
[09:27:52] <notchris> taplar_: If you have 20 li's in a row
[09:27:57] <notchris> Wrap every 3 in a div
[09:32:16] <taplar_> gonch: dude, your changing the disabled state in your handler after your changing it in the length check function
[09:32:19] <notchris> taplar_: https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/prcmok93/1/
[09:32:39] <taplar_> both testChars and updateCountdown are changing the disabled state of the button
[09:33:21] <taplar_> notchris: it's not valid markup to wrap trs in anything other than a thead or tbody
[09:33:40] <taplar_> or a table, of course.  your browser will reject anything else
[09:33:46] <notchris> ahh
[09:34:09] <notchris> taplar_: https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/prcmok93/2/
[09:34:10] <notchris> Still not working
[09:34:14] <taplar_> one of the more restrictive elements in html, :)
[09:34:25] <gonch> taplar, yea, should i make the diasble a function?
[09:35:04] <taplar_> so your disabling if it is too long or it is invalid format?
[09:35:40] <taplar_> personally i'd probably include the too long as part of my invalid format check
[09:36:53] <taplar_> notchris: https://jsfiddle.net/prcmok93/3/
[09:37:10] <taplar_> not sure why your trying to wrap though.  free floating trs aren't valid markup either
[09:37:37] <Macaveli> i have an input with name and id personal_info[LASTNAME] how do I select it?
[09:37:54] <notchris> Hmm
[09:37:57] <notchris> Still not working
[09:38:20] <taplar_> notchris: that last fiddle for me shows a double nested tbody
[09:38:26] <taplar_> when i inspect the table
[09:38:51] <taplar_> Macaveli: why do you hate yourself?  lol
[09:38:59] <taplar_> can you change that?
[09:39:14] <Macaveli> taplar_ I didn't create the code I just need to implement some js
[09:39:30] <speedio> taplar_: do you know why it wont work? appreciate the help
[09:41:00] <taplar_> Macaveli: https://jsfiddle.net/ayevkyna/
[09:41:47] <taplar_> speedio: can you share your updated logic?
[09:41:55] <Macaveli> thanks taplar_
[09:42:03] <taplar_> sure
[09:44:30] <speedio> taplar_: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rLjWMK , i think the problem is that .first finds searchs upwards instead of down?
[09:44:53] <taplar_> first() is just a filter.  it returns the first element in the result set
[09:45:05] <taplar_> same as eq(0)
[09:45:26] <speedio> taplar_: ok
[09:46:19] <taplar_> there we go!
[09:46:28] <taplar_> $('li.active').parents('.sub-menu').show();
[09:47:19] <speedio> taplar_: not working.. 'Save Customer Info' should be shown as well?
[09:47:52] <taplar_> is the active only going to be on the top level sub-menus?
[09:48:23] <speedio> taplar_: nevermind, used both and it worked now.. thanks so much :)
[09:48:31] <taplar_> k
[09:49:30] <speedio> taplar_: so first() did select both the parent and child sub-menu?
[09:49:45] <taplar_> no first() is just a filter
[09:50:00] <taplar_> https://api.jquery.com/first/
[09:50:08] <speedio> ok.. so what did cause it to not work before?
[09:51:08] <taplar_> you were not going up.  the active sub-menu has a sub-menu above it that is hidden
[09:51:47] <taplar_> li.active's parent sub-menu is hidden
[09:52:08] <taplar_> you were just trying to show the nested sub-menu, but since the parent is hidden, doesn't matter if the children are not hidden
[09:52:42] <taplar_> which is why i was asking if the active class was only going to exist at the top sub-menu level
[09:52:53] <taplar_> cause if so, your css rule could be changed to make that a little easier
[09:53:22] <Sal> hi
[09:53:53] <Sal> http://jsbin.com/satupohadu/edit?js
[09:54:35] <Sal> does this module need to be initialized ? because that event listeners on mu win Chrome and Android 6 chrome works
[09:54:39] <taplar_> you got some errors
[09:54:54] <Sal> on iOs and on Android 5, doesn't
[09:54:58] <taplar_> missing a semi colon after the searchSubmit()
[09:55:24] <Sal> yes, that was a last insert, in real code there is
[09:55:42] <Sal> but, do i need to init listeners?
[09:55:55] <Sal> or are they just initialized because of the var assignment?
[09:56:16] <taplar_> 'listeners' ?
[09:56:27] <Sal> $('#search-id').on('keypress keydown',
[09:57:25] <taplar_> that will bind when the function executes, which is immediate since it's in an IIFE.  I'd be curious where your including this on your page as your not in a doc ready.  have you tried logging the length of your selector to make sure your finding it?
[09:58:16] <Sal> logging the lenght? how is that?
[09:58:26] <taplar_> console.log($(selector).length)
[09:58:31] <taplar_> if it's > 0 it found it
[09:58:45] <taplar_> if == 0 then either it doesn't exist yet, or your selector is bad
[09:58:45] <Sal> but, i could just change it putting the var init inside a document ready?
[09:58:48] <Sal> is that it?
[09:59:07] <taplar_> it depends.  if your script is at the bottom of your page and that element is not dynamically created it should work fine
[09:59:11] <VectorX> taplar_ thanks, i did not notice that, but you are correct
[09:59:25] <Sal> it is a t the bottom
[09:59:45] <Sal> and it is working on win chrome and andoid 6 chrome
[09:59:49] <taplar_> so should be fine, but you could l
[09:59:57] <taplar_> log it anyway just to make sure
[10:00:01] <taplar_> bbl, got some meetings
[10:00:11] <Sal> thanks

[11:02:12] <php> How might I detect if someone is typing outside of an input field?

[11:08:13] <yield> Hi all, I'm using jquery 1.12.3 along with the plugin jstree 3.3.1. This app also uses dojo. It is working great. Now I'm also loading a non amd style third party library, which I wrapped around a define(). When loading this library, jstree just becomes unresponsive. How can I track down this issue? Sorry, I know this is vague, but I have no idea about what to look for.
[11:41:23] <jose3_> HELLO! I want to creat keyboard shortcuts for something I am building: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b81b06ad8ec83184867920c8bc5c1a03 . How do i combine  shortcuts? like right now its only listening for only two keys, left and right. i want a user tohit control+left. also what are the numbers representing the kys called? Charcodes?
[11:41:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to detect if keydown has happened for a modifier, but NOT keyup.
[11:42:26] <robertmaxrees> it's a little hairy but doable.
[11:43:35] <jose3_> hmmm ok let me check into that
[11:43:36] <jose3_> thanks
[11:43:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13539493/how-to-detect-keyboard-modifier-ctrl-or-shift-through-javascript
[11:43:47] <robertmaxrees> some ideas might be in here.
[11:44:14] <robertmaxrees> there's also a getModifierState method iirc.
[11:44:17] <robertmaxrees> search around on google.
[11:45:17] <php> How might I detect if someone is typing outside of an input field?
[11:45:18] <php> Like when you start typing on Google and it focuses on the input so your search goes through
[11:45:38] <yield> jose3_, look at jquery's plugin called hotkeys
[11:45:54] <jose3_> @robertmaxrees thanks
[11:45:55] <robertmaxrees> php global event listener.
[11:46:07] <jose3_> Id prefer not to use another plugin
[11:46:31] <php> robertmaxrees, I want to detect it but not do the function when they are in a text field
[11:46:35] <php> so only when not focused on a field
[11:46:48] <robertmaxrees> php then you check if $(this).closest('someClassorSomething');
[11:47:04] <robertmaxrees> * if ($(this).closest('someClassorSomething').length) {};
[11:47:07] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[11:47:18] <yield> jose3_, it will probably just save you some work, it is as simple as $(document).bind('keyup', 'F2', function () { ... }), and you can combine modifiers
[11:47:30] <php> um
[11:47:44] <robertmaxrees> or negate that, w/e.
[11:47:46] <robertmaxrees> you get the idea
[11:47:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:47:56] <robertmaxrees> yield woah that plugin still uses .bind()?
[11:48:45] <yield> robertmaxrees, one can also use .on I guess :p
[11:48:56] <robertmaxrees> *should ;)
[11:49:23] <php> robertmaxrees, does $("body").on('keydown', ...); also get fired when I click on a text field and type?
[11:49:35] <robertmaxrees> php event bubbling.
[11:49:41] <php> whats that
[11:49:42] <robertmaxrees> events bubble up through the page.

[11:50:00] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> basically, when an event fires, it notifies its direct parent about it, which notifies its parent, etc etc etc.
[11:50:28] <robertmaxrees> all the way to the root node.
[11:50:34] <robertmaxrees> not ALL events do this, but most do.
[11:50:40] <php> ok
[11:51:13] <robertmaxrees> so in your case, i'd actually check the event target.
[11:51:43] <php> I have an idea
[11:51:47] <php> http://stackoverflow.com/a/10344293
[11:51:50] <php> Can merge it with that
[11:51:56] <robertmaxrees> if (!$(event.target).is('.someClass').length) {}
[11:52:10] <robertmaxrees> you could, but there's no need to.
[11:52:16] <php> oh
[11:52:30] <robertmaxrees> you can use classes or other selectors since you're in jqueryland
[11:52:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:52:58] <php> if (!$(event.target).is('input').length) { /* do shit */ }
[11:53:00] <php> ???
[11:53:18] <robertmaxrees> it's too early and the coffee hasn't kicked in.
[11:53:25] <robertmaxrees> no need for the length in that case.
[11:53:39] <php> if ($(e.target).is('input')) {
[11:53:39] <php>         return;
[11:53:39] <php>     }
[11:53:41] <php> oops
[11:53:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:53:47] <php> client showed that as 1 line
[11:53:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd invert that - check the negated version.
[11:54:13] <php> Why's that?
[11:54:24] <robertmaxrees> since you care about the case where the user ISN'T typing in an input.
[11:54:39] <php> http://i.imgur.com/VOq3rcd.png
[11:54:41] <VectorX> in this example, after you check the Autoplay button, how would you pause or reset the auto slide on hover over the slide so it doesnt side while mouse over image https://jsfiddle.net/f5hxuf76/
[11:54:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm not a fan of structuring code like that.
[11:55:01] <php> 't's in a function
[11:55:07] <php> I assume you like lots of if/elses?
[11:55:07] <robertmaxrees> doesnt matter imo.
[11:55:09] <php> :P
[11:55:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:55:28] <robertmaxrees> i actually dislike them - that's why when i use them, i make sure they're as clear as possible.
[11:55:49] <php> with this, i stop the code dead in its tracks if its input
[11:55:56] <php> otherwise i continue
[11:56:07] <robertmaxrees> still find it less readable personally, but to each their own.
[11:57:30] <php> robertmaxrees, http://i.imgur.com/5LrvEFq.png
[11:57:32] <php> readable enough
[11:57:36] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[11:57:41] <robertmaxrees> also: screenshots of code make me cry.
[11:57:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:57:55] <php> better than pastebinning
[11:58:02] <robertmaxrees> another place where we disagree hahaha
[11:58:04] <php> for code u dont need to copy lel
[11:58:16] <robertmaxrees> bpaste et al are easier to read than a screenshot.
[11:58:22] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) but meh.
[12:20:57] <bambams> For some reason my form success handler is not getting expected parameters.
[12:21:13] <bambams> jQuery("#my-form").ajaxSuccess(handler);
[12:21:34] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[12:21:35] <bambams> But handler is getting called with a single parameter containing just the event arguments. I can't seem to access the data...
[12:21:59] <bambams> Probably anxient since the software has been maintained for a couple of years: v1.11.1
[12:22:04] <bambams> ancient*
[12:22:18] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxsuccess/#ajaxSuccess-handler
[12:22:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not ancient.
[12:22:26] <robertmaxrees> use .then()
[12:22:43] <robertmaxrees> unless you really need the event handler version.
[12:22:51] <robertmaxrees> in which case just specifcy the args and you're good to go.
[12:24:21] <bambams> No, it's not receiving the args. That's what is so bizarre. arguments.length === 1.
[12:24:33] <robertmaxrees> then you have another problem.
[12:25:53] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't pass around the deferred instead?
[12:31:08] <bambams> I'm not invoking $.ajax myself. It's being invoked by jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js, I believe.
[12:31:26] <taplar> fun
[12:31:33] <robertmaxrees> the one from microsoft?
[12:31:43] <bambams> Yes.
[12:32:31] <bambams> If I look at the call stack I can see an event handler being called with the exact arguments that I expect. But it takes another pass through the jquery library before calling *my* handler and the args are lost... :(
[12:32:42] <robertmaxrees> that seems reall suspect to me.
[12:32:49] <robertmaxrees> the lib should be preserving them just fine.
[12:32:50] <z1haze_work> is there a way to count elements between other elements on a page? example would be counting the .video div's between the .video-section-title h1's https://gyazo.com/ba608a477817641c421dd28e74a3cf38
[12:33:20] <bambams> Actually it seems like jquery-migrate-1.2.1.js is actually where the args are lost... Don't even know what that is. This is a software product developed by a team over many years..
[12:33:41] <robertmaxrees> jqmigrate makes it so old method calls and things keep working.
[12:33:56] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't make sense since ajaxSuccess has always supplied the same 3 args to the callback.
[12:33:58] <taplar> z1haze_work: take a look at nextUntil()
[12:36:00] <z1haze_work> thank you
[12:36:46] <bambams> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GLt4f-cSjkYVFZOUhmZ1FCS28/view?usp=sharing
[12:37:07] <robertmaxrees> unless somebody modified the source of jq / jqm, i have no idea.
[12:37:24] <bambams> dispatch there has the correct args. The anonymous function being focused is what throws them away.
[12:38:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:39:26] <bambams> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4GLt4f-cSjkU1VpdXM1RjlDbVU/view?usp=sharing
[12:39:42] <bambams> The anonymous function on this line is getting the right args. But as you can see, it ignores them...
[12:40:07] <bambams> I don't understand how this leads to my handler. Too many layers. But it seems silly that it's getting called with the ajax event handler args and is not passing them on...
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> also...
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you bind the handler to the document instead?
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> i think i know what your problem might be.
[12:47:42] <robertmaxrees> bambams
[12:49:04] <bambams> robertmaxrees: It worked that way, but I switched to this because my closure was not working as expected and this seemed to fixed *that*... :-/ So perhaps I should go back to binding to the document and try to work out why my closure isn't working.
[12:49:11] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[12:49:19] <robertmaxrees> it's actually not valid to bind to the element
[12:49:23] <robertmaxrees> for ajax event handlers.
[12:49:27] <robertmaxrees> that would explain why.
[12:49:40] <robertmaxrees> so lets handle the closure issue :)
[12:49:42] <bambams> Indeed.
[12:51:52] <z1haze_work> taplar: look at this: https://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/ how would i count them?
[12:52:03] <robertmaxrees> .length
[12:52:07] <taplar> ^
[12:53:10] <z1haze_work> so $(el).nextUntil(anotherEl).length?
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> something like that, yeah.
[12:54:06] <z1haze_work> it says it takes elem, i, until as params? what are the i and elem?
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that?
[12:54:50] <z1haze_work> in my ide
[12:54:55] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:55:00] <robertmaxrees> it does not take thise.
[12:55:03] <z1haze_work> ok
[12:55:10] <robertmaxrees> selector or element and filter
[12:55:12] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[12:56:24] <taplar> optionally put a span around the group and change your strategy, >:D
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[12:56:54] <Uhkis> you mean: put a different spin on the span?
[12:57:13] <taplar> oh, is there a span?
[12:58:05] <taplar> or Uhkis is being mean to me
[12:58:07] <Uhkis> i dont know, i just saw the word span and change your strategy
[12:58:28] <Uhkis> and thought spin span would be your kind of joke
[12:58:35] <Uhkis> clearly i was wrong =(
[12:58:48] <robertmaxrees> you were just trying to bridge the span between you two.
[12:58:49] <taplar> ah, you caught me is a semi serious moment i guess.
[12:58:52] <taplar> lmao
[12:58:55] <robertmaxrees> he was out of his element.
[12:58:56] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[12:59:13] <arc_> wow
[12:59:19] <Uhkis> what, you have serious moments?!
[12:59:23] <taplar> semi
[12:59:33] <taplar> all i can achieve is a semi
[12:59:33] <arc_> i think that might have been too subtle
[12:59:38] <taplar> taplar - 2016
[13:01:02] <taplar> i....want.....some-thing-else.....to get me through this....semi charmed kind of life
[13:01:05] * taplar keeps singing
[13:01:38] <bambams> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/wehoyudelo/edit?html,js,output
[13:02:01] <bambams> Long story short, that's essentially what I'm doing. But it's Friday and a deadline of 5 PM is looming and my closure-fu isn't working.
[13:02:21] <bambams> The idInput appears to be the last one bound instead of the specific instance for that specific button. Which doesn't make sense to me...
[13:02:33] <robertmaxrees> well back way up.
[13:02:40] <robertmaxrees> 'cause there's some weird stuff going on here.
[13:02:47] <taplar> sorry...
[13:03:04] <Uhkis> true, one shouldn't be on irc asking for help if the deadline is hours away
[13:03:22] <robertmaxrees> first off - jQuery(document).ajaxSuccess(success)\;
[13:04:17] <robertmaxrees> second, idSelector = jQuery("id-input") - this isn't selecting enything.
[13:04:42] <robertmaxrees> unless you're running this in an environment that actually supports <id-input> as an element.
[13:05:18] <z1haze_work> how would i select (for example) the fourth item after an element
[13:05:46] <robertmaxrees> get the index of the current element, then get the sibling whose index matches that + 4
[13:06:11] <bambams> robertmaxrees: Ah, yeah, second one should have been e.data("id-input")... >_<
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> bambams you realize that a lot of those aren't valid selectors, yeah?
[13:06:36] <robertmaxrees> err, rather, that one.
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> unless you have a . or # in front of it?
[13:06:56] <bambams> robertmaxrees: It's not a selector. It's a data key. :)
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> it's used a selector.
[13:07:35] <bambams> That was a typo. Fixed. :)
[13:07:36] <taplar> 'e' is hurting my brain
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> bambams so did you read what i said about the way you're binding this?
[13:08:06] <Uhkis> taplar: stop the drugs man!
[13:08:10] <taplar> lmao
[13:08:13] <taplar> nyce
[13:08:14] <robertmaxrees> .on() and .ajaxSuccesS() are differnet.
[13:08:15] <bambams> taplar: theDownloadButtonElementJqueryObject
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> you can't do a delegated listener for ajax events like you do other events last i checked.
[13:08:33] <taplar> yeah, i'm reading, just 'e' is usually an error object
[13:08:43] <taplar> err, event
[13:08:59] <bambams> Just seems weird to have a global ajax handler... When you could have multiple ajax requests in a page...
[13:09:13] <bambams> How do you know which one you're processing?
[13:09:35] <robertmaxrees> it's weird to use them in the first place, and the event object that gets passed has that info.
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> event.target or event.currentTarget depending on your needs should get you there.
[13:10:26] <taplar> and why are we doing a delegate event handler for every one of the things, instead of giving them a shared selector...
[13:10:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:10:39] <taplar> probably already been pointed out
[13:10:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd worry about that next though.
[13:16:40] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: i cant figure it out.. i see no method to get the nth sibling
[13:17:11] <robertmaxrees> can you get all siblings? :)
[13:17:42] <z1haze_work> yea but thats not what i want
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:17:52] <z1haze_work> :\
[13:17:52] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[13:18:01] <robertmaxrees> you get all siblings and then get https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> $theElement.siblings().eq(14); or whatever.
[13:18:28] <z1haze_work> hmm i was just trying that and it wasnt givig me the correct element
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> how far off was it?
[13:18:41] <z1haze_work> $(this).siblings().eq(index + length);
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> i'ma guess by, say, 1?
[13:18:46] <z1haze_work> it was only giving me the original element
[13:18:52] <z1haze_work> no
[13:19:04] <taplar> siblings() does not include yourself
[13:19:04] <z1haze_work> it was giving me the element im starting with
[13:19:12] <taplar> iirc
[13:19:14] <Uhkis> are you sure both of those were numbers, not strings? :)
[13:19:18] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:19:19] <z1haze_work> it must be + 1 then
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> lots of check there.
[13:19:38] <z1haze_work> let me see if it was just off by +1
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:19:49] <fxmulder> is there a way to populate a select field when the user drops it down?
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> so you weren't sure if that was the case?
[13:20:31] <taplar> var thefamily = self.parent.children; thefamily.eq(thefamily.index(self) + offset)
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[13:20:51] <taplar> slightly pseudocode
[13:20:55] <robertmaxrees> though ideally you'd already have all of these stored in an object.
[13:22:05] <taplar> fxmulder: you mean a <select>?
[13:22:25] <fxmulder> taplar: yeah
[13:22:35] <taplar> how are you able to drop it down if it is not populated?
[13:22:52] <robertmaxrees> why would you populate it then and not before?
[13:23:10] <AwkwardCough> is there something else that is suppose to change the contents of the select before dropping down?
[13:23:30] <fxmulder> you can still drop an empty select field, it is dependent on another text field
[13:23:41] <robertmaxrees> why not update it after you fill out the text field then?
[13:24:46] <fxmulder> well I don't want to update after every key press and a delay seems hackish' they could drop down the select before the delay finishes
[13:24:58] <robertmaxrees> then do it when the input loses focus.
[13:25:39] <fxmulder> the input could lose focus when they click the drop down though
[13:25:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:25:51] <robertmaxrees> which is fine.
[13:25:53] <fxmulder> that may work thoguh
[13:25:58] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:26:13] <fxmulder> so long as it renders again after populating
[13:26:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> you mean shows the added items?>
[13:26:54] <fxmulder> I have to make a json request to populate so they'll get an empty list initially
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[13:27:14] <taplar> or make it unselectable until it is populated
[13:27:55] <fxmulder> I'll try the unfocused route to see what that produces
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> you realize that there WILL be some kind of delay, right?
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> like, that's ajax for ya.
[13:28:54] <decx> why ajax in select content
[13:29:03] <decx> if it's so much then a select is the wrong thing to use
[13:29:26] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet you it's like a county dropdown for a state or something.
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily ideal.
[13:29:34] <robertmaxrees> but not uncommon.
[13:36:20] <aperyon> hi all! id like to fade out a div, load data into it (div stays hidden) and then fade in. the problem is, the load function makes the div visible again. how do i go about this?
[13:38:15] <z1haze_work> I need some logic to ensure that my elements are always a multiple of 4. because im using flex display space-between.. so want to just clone and display none some hidden elements to keep the flow correct.. but im stuggling on my logic
[13:38:32] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[13:38:53] <z1haze_work> need a fiddle for this?
[13:39:27] <z1haze_work> i just want some logic to put for if the length of my items if is not a multiple of 4, inert the correct number of hidden elements to fill it up
[13:39:46] <taplar> hidden...
[13:40:19] <bambams> robertmaxrees: target and currentTarget are both 'document'. -_- Therefore, I have no context for which request it is or where it was called...
[13:40:34] <z1haze_work> im trying to use some modulus but when for example there's 3 items
[13:40:46] <bambams> And context doesn't appear to come through to my handler using jQuery(document).ajaxSuccess(function() {}).
[13:40:50] <z1haze_work> the modulous is 3 so it tries to add 3 more hidden elements, but only should add 1
[13:40:52] <bambams> Got lots of references to document though. >_>
[13:40:54] <aperyon> Even if i try with opacity 0 it pops up again immediatly once the load is done
[13:41:53] <bambams> Oh, there we go, arguments[2].context works.
[13:42:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check the args.
[13:43:42] <darkling> z1haze_work: You probably want to add 4-(n%4) items, not n%4 items...
[13:46:50] <bambams> robertmaxrees: But only because that was a manually started $.ajax() call.
[13:47:04] <robertmaxrees> bambams sorry, got pulled away.
[13:47:08] <robertmaxrees> dealing with a pretty nasty bug.
[13:47:09] <robertmaxrees> D:
[13:47:14] <bambams> robertmaxrees: The Microsoft-style unobtrusive AJAX form has no context. Nothing. All I have is document. :(
[13:47:24] <bambams> robertmaxrees: Sorry to hear that. :(
[13:47:28] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just use your own ajax calls?
[13:47:46] <bambams> robertmaxrees: Company policy. The dev. manager would lose his shit if I started doing everything differently. :P
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> heh, but the tool they gave you doesn't do the job ;)
[13:48:57] <bambams> Yeah, well, it's the "beloved" Microsoft tool so obviously that is right and I am wrong. >_>
[13:49:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm all for consistency, too, fwiw.  i might flag them and let them know the story.
[13:52:12] <notchris> How can I remove a stylesheet from an iframed page
[13:52:14] <notchris> On the same domain
[13:52:15] <notchris> $('iframe').contents().find($('link[rel="stylesheet"]')).remove();
[13:52:17] <notchris> Did not work
[13:54:15] <PantsOfChocolate> so i have a random jquery/ javascript question, so when i submit a pge with a payment, hit complete order, go to a page that says its been submitted then hit back the credit card info is still there. So whats the best way to handle this? on button click? on unload? on load of page?
[13:54:24] <robertmaxrees> notchris is that even selecting anything?
[13:54:38] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChocolate handle what?
[13:54:44] <robertmaxrees> you want to clear the inputs?
[13:55:19] <PantsOfChocolate> yea
[13:55:26] <PantsOfChocolate> i dont want people to like accidentally rebuy thigns
[13:55:38] <PantsOfChocolate> or you know
[13:55:42] <PantsOfChocolate> get their shit stolen
[13:56:06] <robertmaxrees> autocomplete="off"
[13:56:22] <robertmaxrees> though that may not fix your problem.
[13:56:24] <PantsOfChocolate> really? so if you finish a submit then hit back thats due to autocomplete?
[13:56:28] <PantsOfChocolate> ah damn
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure we worry about that at my company.
[13:56:47] <PantsOfChocolate> dont get my hopes up youve been helping me skate by  as a javascript engineer for years
[13:56:57] <notchris> robertmaxrees: $('iframe').contents().remove();
[13:57:00] <notchris> fails to work as well
[13:57:19] <robertmaxrees> notchris that's... not what I asked?
[13:57:24] <notchris> Yes it is
[13:57:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:57:27] <bambams> robertmaxrees: To be fair, we very rarely do things the hard way in JavaScript. Most of the site functions purely from the "unobtrusive" forms.
[13:57:39] <notchris> I mean, yes, it is selecting the iframe
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> notchris i mean $('iframe').contents().find($('link[rel="stylesheet"]')).length
[13:57:53] <robertmaxrees> bambams i'm not saying to do it the hard way.
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> just that in this case it doesn't seem like the right tool :)
[13:58:05] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[13:58:38] <bambams> robertmaxrees: Main reason I'm using $.ajax() is because I need two requests per button click: first, post to the server, generate a PDF document, store it in the database, and return a record ID. Then download that PDF using that ID.
[13:59:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  that's sane.
[14:00:55] <bambams> I really do wish we were working at a bit lower level because then I'd have more control to solve problems. It's frustrating when the framework just doesn't do something you need... Only workaround seems to be a hack.
[14:01:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm not familiar with the framework, but you should be able to get what you need out of what's supplied to the callback for ajaxSuccess
[14:01:29] <notchris> Weird
[14:01:30] <notchris> Blocked a frame with origin "https://www.ctsciencecenter.org" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> notchris same port, protocol, and domain?
[14:01:40] <notchris> Even though I set the origin on the page I'm requesting
[14:02:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:02:11] <notchris> robertmaxrees: https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/peo-redesign/
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a different protocol
[14:03:27] <notchris> How?
[14:03:35] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm i cannot read.
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> this has been a rough day hahaha
[14:03:45] <notchris> all good
[14:04:00] <notchris> Requested page has Access-Control-Allow-Origin:https://www.ctsciencecenter.org
[14:04:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't need that if you're already on the same domain.
[14:04:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd make sure there's no trickery with redirects.
[14:04:42] <notchris> Well the other domain is tickets.ctsciencecenter.org
[14:04:46] <notchris> Not on same server though
[14:04:50] <notchris> It's our ticketing website
[14:04:50] <robertmaxrees> server doesn't matter.
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> URL does.
[14:04:57] <notchris> hmm
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> i am now off to go handle some stuff.  enjoy folks.
[14:12:52] <z1haze_work> ugh, when i add elements to the dom during a .each() the index of my elements actually changes but jquery doesnt update it
[14:20:20] <z1haze_work> i need a way to keep 4 items in each row with markup like this: so using jquery to clone() elements and hide them to fill in the gaps https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/oprqjhk0/3/ any thoughts?
[14:21:06] <z1haze_work> im confused myself too much on this
[14:23:07] <dranve> hello guys, i have HUGE js file which is "minified" is there any decent online web-based tool which would format that back to normal?
[14:23:26] <z1haze_work> did you google this?
[14:27:09] <dranve> z1haze_work, milion solutions none works fine :)
[14:27:24] <dranve> z1haze_work, maybe this one.. https://www.dirtymarkup.com/
[14:27:27] <dranve> just trying
[14:35:05] <z1haze_work> how dont they work
[14:54:21] <notchris> I have an iframe that I can modify the contents
[14:54:26] <notchris> But nothing is having an effect
[14:54:31] <notchris> Even $('#test').contents().remove();
[14:54:36] <notchris> Does not do anything
[14:55:30] <cannap> are you sure you can manipulate iframes?
[14:55:41] <cannap> i mean wtf who is using iframes
[14:57:18] <arc_> what do you mean you can modify the contents
[14:57:24] <arc_> you say you can, and then you say you can't
[14:57:57] <cannap> you can say $('#iframeid').remove();
[14:58:04] <arc_> : /
[14:58:08] <cannap> but not the content in the iframe
[14:58:11] <cannap> not sure
[14:58:59] <bango2> yeah arc_ there are only special cases where you can modify the contents of an iframe
[14:59:16] <arc_> i know
[14:59:30] <arc_> i want to know why he thinks he can modify the contents, if his tests show he can't
[14:59:45] <bango2> oh sorry that was directed at notchris
[14:59:50] <cannap> i dont know xD
[14:59:51] <arc_> ya
[15:00:54] <bango2> notchris thats generally considered cross site scripting, and there are safeguards against it. is your iframe content in the same domain as the page hosting the iframe?
[15:01:07] <notchris> bango2: Yes
[15:01:13] <notchris> bango2: Im abiding by CORS
[15:01:20] <notchris> bango2: https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/peo-redesign/
[15:01:35] <notchris> My request response origin matches
[15:01:47] <cannap> you can do the same scroll shit with pure css
[15:01:52] <bango2> subdomain is different
[15:02:05] <cannap> or an ajax call
[15:02:12] <arc_> your console has an error
[15:02:15] <bango2> are you wanting to resize the iframe height to fit? notchris
[15:02:24] <bango2> thats what i was wanting to do when i was having to learn about this stuff
[15:03:13] <notchris> bango2: No
[15:03:20] <notchris> I want to modify the content of the frame
[15:03:26] <notchris> Which I DO have access to
[15:03:37] <notchris> Even set document.domain = "ctsciencecenter.org";
[15:03:39] <notchris> On both
[15:03:44] <bango2> i dont think it will allow that from a different subdomain. i was trying to do the same thing
[15:03:53] <arc_> if you look at your console you will see your issue
[15:04:22] <arc_> also if i type jquery code into the console, i get 'jQuery is not defined'
[15:04:24] <notchris> There's no errors in my console
[15:04:31] <notchris> https://i.imgur.com/Nw1wJrC.png
[15:04:35] <arc_> Invalid 'X-Frame-Options' header encountered when loading 'https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/default.asp': 'ALLOW-FROM *' is not a recognized directive. The header will be ignored.
[15:04:41] <notchris> I removed it
[15:05:07] <arc_> lol.. so there was an error, you just fixed it before responding to me
[15:05:08] <arc_> okay
[15:05:38] <bango2> hahaha
[15:05:40] <bango2> same
[15:06:17] <notchris> No
[15:06:21] <notchris> I removed it before I asked
[15:06:27] <notchris> Maybe it took some time to refresh
[15:08:09] <notchris> ?
[15:08:12] <notchris> So no errors
[15:08:16] <notchris> And my headers are correct
[15:08:22] <notchris> Still cant modify the frame
[15:08:35] <arc_> idk, something strange is going on. when i first tried to just do $('#test').length; it returned 0
[15:08:43] <arc_> then i started trying to select other stuff and it kept returning 0
[15:08:48] <arc_> then eventually it started working
[15:08:55] <arc_> and now $('#test').length; returns 1
[15:09:01] <notchris> But try doing
[15:09:08] <notchris> $('#test').contents().remove();
[15:09:12] <arc_> yes that does not work
[15:09:21] <notchris> So weird, right?
[15:11:53] <arc_> yeah idk i'm not that experienced with cors
[15:18:45] <cannap> notchris giveup
[15:18:48] <cannap> this will not work xD
[15:19:15] <cannap> it will just on work on clientside
[15:19:25] <cannap> while you visit the page
[15:19:27] <printForever> got a page that is trashing my fancybox and reseting it...
[15:19:35] <printForever> need a second pair of eyes to take a look
[15:19:39] <printForever> because I'm going freaking nuts
[15:19:54] <printForever> I disabled what I could, but the error is still there
[15:20:28] <printForever> http://bit.ly/28WisHs
[15:20:39] <notchris> ?
[15:20:48] <printForever> when clicking on the image
[15:20:57] <printForever> lightbox should appear (fancybox)
[15:20:59] <printForever> but it does not
[15:21:12] <printForever> the black overlay is missing
[15:21:15] <cannap> @printForever, http://screencloud.net/v/sY9D
[15:21:20] <printForever> the image opens...
[15:21:24] <cannap> ah
[15:21:28] <cannap> yea you say it as last
[15:21:42] <cannap> where is the overlay
[15:21:46] <cannap> name?
[15:21:58] <printForever> overlay is missing
[15:22:05] <cannap> i dont know
[15:22:08] <printForever> and you need to click on the image 2x so it would g large
[15:22:31] <cannap> yea you made something wring
[15:22:33] <cannap> wrong
[15:22:45] <cannap> or as k the developer from this plugin
[15:22:48] <cannap> ask
[15:22:52] <printForever> I've tested this as pure HTML before moving it to WP
[15:23:05] <printForever> it worked just fine
[15:23:16] <cannap> same jquery version?
[15:23:25] <printForever> same jQuery version
[15:23:56] <cannap> dont know sry
[15:24:01] <printForever> k
[15:24:07] <printForever> taplar, you here?
[15:24:36] <printForever> Cork?
[15:24:50] <printForever> my debugging skills are not on par with this one
[15:24:56] <taplar> yup
[15:25:02] <printForever> I can't find what is reseting the freaking fancybox
[15:25:27] <printForever> when clicking on the image, it looks like it's opening correctly but then it just goes small, smaller than a thumbnail
[15:25:45] <printForever> also, overlay is missing, so I'm guessing there has to be some issue with CSS, but that's not a problem
[15:26:32] <printForever> this is the url bit.ly/28WisHs
[15:27:57] <taplar> what specifically am i clicking?
[15:29:08] <taplar> cause other than not seeming to have an option to make the larger image go away, it seems to work fine for me
[15:32:26] <jose3_> I have this code: $('#collapseOne').collapse('toggle'); which works
[15:33:06] <jose3_> however, this isnt normal accordion (bootstrap) behavior because if you click it, it will close the other portions. This is allowing me to have multiple ones open
[15:34:14] <shoky> printForever: you're missing fancybox css file no?
[15:34:42] <shoky> also you're including your own code before including fancybox
[15:42:51] <printForever> taplar, just click on an image
[15:43:26] <printForever> taplar, the image is being enlarged by Fancybox but not by 1st click, it opens on 2nd
[15:47:48] <printForever> shoky, the css file is there, check the source
[15:48:22] <shoky> printForever: where?
[15:48:45] <printForever> horry sheet
[15:48:52] <shoky> ;o
[15:49:03] <printForever> thank you!
[15:49:08] <shoky> ;p
[15:49:22] <printForever> grade A moron, right here
[15:51:26] <printForever> but I did include it... it didn't parse
[17:09:17] <nux> how would i access an objects value (like object.created), but call it from a variable. i have wantedValues = [ 'id', 'created'];  array.forEach(function(name) { console.log(data.{variable here?!?!!}) });
[17:09:29] <nux> i hope that question isn't as confusing as my search for an answer
[17:09:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean the variable is the name of the property?
[17:10:04] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe make a simplified test case?
[17:10:21] <nux> oo i think i got it. object[variableForKey]
[17:10:25] <nux> thanks for letting me blog to you all
[17:10:32] <robertmaxrees> yep - don't foreach though.
[17:10:41] <robertmaxrees> well, depending - do you want to know if they all exist?
[17:10:47] <robertmaxrees> or which ones don't?  etc.
[17:10:51] <nux> if (data[name].length) { }
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need length on there.
[17:11:21] <nux> some google result said that's how i would check if an object key exists. i will remove it as it does seem unusual
[17:12:07] <nux> ah - works perfect now. thanks
[17:24:46] <vb2> How can i start or access a a plugin/addon in firefox via jquery event?
[17:25:07] <robertmaxrees> bind a listener in the addon.,
[17:45:49] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[17:56:18] <fxmulder_> so that didn't work, if I update the select field when the text field unfocused and test this by clicking the select field, I get an empty list that doesn't update
[17:56:37] <fxmulder_> if I close the select and reopen it then it updates
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you're doing?
[17:56:59] <robertmaxrees> maybe even setup a test case?
[17:57:35] <fxmulder_> Yeah I'll have to do that when I get home tonight
[19:01:37] <tables> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/  <-- when i select a date, how can i change the page?
[19:01:43] <tables> or put a query in like a submit button would
[19:02:00] <tables> i want query=selecteddate
[19:02:26] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[19:05:13] <robertmaxrees> tables you bind using this and then set the window.location.href
[19:06:14] <tables> can you show me syntax?
[19:06:21] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[19:06:25] <robertmaxrees> of which part?
[19:07:34] <tables> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf71utd9/
[19:07:41] <tables> can you help me?
[19:07:44] <robertmaxrees> lol;
[19:07:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use fiddles.
[19:08:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf71utd9/1/
[19:08:33] <robertmaxrees> this is.
[19:09:09] <robertmaxrees> so where are you confused?
[19:15:26] <robertmaxrees> Welp
[19:23:53] <_mariacheline> Hi everyone
[19:24:03] <robertmaxrees> hello
[19:25:11] <_mariacheline> new to jquery, i don't get why this code isn't working? :/ https://jsfiddle.net/b1xw2qjd/
[19:25:47] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle?
[19:26:11] <_mariacheline> Yea, there's this .about thats suppose to slideup but not doing it
[19:26:20] <_mariacheline> I followed this instruction from youtube
[19:26:35] <robertmaxrees> display: none;
[19:26:39] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to slide.
[19:26:45] <_mariacheline> Well
[19:27:23] <robertmaxrees> also: you didn't include jquery in that fiddle fwiw.
[19:27:42] <_mariacheline> I wanted it to be hidden at first
[19:27:51] <_mariacheline> Oh .. lol yea
[19:27:51] <robertmaxrees> slideUp hides things...
[19:28:17] <_mariacheline> Hm
[19:28:19] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to animate it opening or something?
[19:28:48] <_mariacheline> I want to be able to click the learn more then this about page will slideUp
[19:29:03] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you thinking "slideup" means?>
[19:29:28] <_mariacheline> Yea, i got that it hides things
[19:29:33] <_mariacheline> Does it?
[19:29:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it animates the height to hide it.
[19:30:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/slideup/
[19:30:46] <robertmaxrees> the first demo shows you the effect.
[19:31:43] <_mariacheline> Uhm, i tried with slideDown but nothing happened
[19:31:50] <robertmaxrees> show me :)
[19:32:30] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it sure seems to work in that fiddle.
[19:32:47] <_mariacheline> hold on a sec
[19:37:06] * robertmaxrees plays jeopardy music
[19:38:00] <_mariacheline> Alright.. it did work o.O
[19:38:15] <_mariacheline> I don't know why it doesnt work on my text editor
[19:38:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:38:27] <robertmaxrees> what editor are you using?
[19:38:41] <_mariacheline> Atom
[19:38:58] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:39:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about how you're running the in your text editor.
[19:39:15] <_mariacheline> Alright folks, i'm stupid
[19:39:24] <_mariacheline> Mispelled jquery..
[19:39:24] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[19:39:29] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaah
[19:39:32] <_mariacheline> Lol
[19:39:36] <robertmaxrees> you know you can use $ instead right?
[19:39:41] <_mariacheline> I hate when this happens :l
[19:39:48] <_mariacheline> No, the link
[19:40:03] <robertmaxrees> what link?
[19:40:47] <_mariacheline> <script src="jquerylinkhere"> this
[19:40:57] <_mariacheline> on the html, i just mispelled it
[19:41:04] <robertmaxrees> oooh you mean script tag.
[19:41:08] <_mariacheline> Anyway, thanks for helping still :)
[19:41:10] <_mariacheline> Yeas
[19:41:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.  that explains a lot hahaha :)
[19:41:24] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[19:41:35] <_mariacheline> Yea, thank you for helping of course :-)
[19:41:51] <robertmaxrees> definitely!  that's why we're here.
[19:45:57] <tables> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf71utd9/3/  <-- how do i make this change the page to whatever i want on onSelect?
[19:46:12] <robertmaxrees> btw use console.log
[19:47:00] <robertmaxrees> and i told you earlier.
[19:47:03] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href
[19:47:55] <tables> can you show me syntax?
[19:48:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:48:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not how we do things here.
[19:48:10] <tables> alert(date) shows the date
[19:48:15] <tables> how do i put the date on the page?
[19:48:25] <robertmaxrees> you could set .text() for an element.
[19:48:27] <tables> mysite.com/mypage?query=06/23/2016
[19:48:28] <robertmaxrees> or append it somewhere.
[19:48:29] <tables> is what i want
[19:48:32] <tables> or something like that
[19:48:40] <robertmaxrees> as a link?  to go to that page?
[19:49:52] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf71utd9/4/
[19:50:00] <robertmaxrees> yo don't do it for him.
[19:50:14] <robertmaxrees> dude needs to learn to be self sufficient :)
[19:50:31] <sillyslux> yea sry
[19:50:56] <sillyslux> there's history and .pushstate have fun learning that :)
[19:51:07] <robertmaxrees> i think he wants to actually go to that page.
[19:51:13] <robertmaxrees> not just modify the address bar.,
[19:51:40] <sillyslux> hmm
[19:51:46] <robertmaxrees> which is easy.
[19:51:50] <sillyslux> tables, what do you want?
[19:52:00] <robertmaxrees> i just want to see him try beyond saying "can you show me syntax"
[19:54:16] <sillyslux> seemingly took off with history.pushState
[19:54:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[20:02:45] <tables> does history.pushState change the page?
[20:02:50] <robertmaxrees> no
[20:02:55] <tables> what changes the page?
[20:03:00] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:03:02] <tables> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf71utd9/4/
[20:03:03] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href
[20:03:10] <robertmaxrees> that's the third time i've said that.
[20:04:26] <tables> just use window.location.href instead of history.pushState?
[20:04:35] <robertmaxrees> you set it to whatever value you wanrt.
[20:04:36] <robertmaxrees> *want
[20:04:40] <robertmaxrees> it's not a function.
[20:04:49] <tables> can you show me in fiddle?
[20:04:50] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href = yourThing
[20:05:16] <tables> can you show me in fiddle please?
[20:05:20] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:05:20] <tables> lol, i'm new to jquery
[20:05:21] <robertmaxrees> why?
[20:05:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:05:25] <robertmaxrees> oit's basic JS.
[20:05:28] <robertmaxrees> not jquery
[20:05:37] <tables> i don't know how to use window.location.href
[20:05:43] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you.
[20:05:46] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href = yourThing
[20:05:51] <tables> what is yourThing?
[20:05:58] <robertmaxrees> whatever data you want it to be.
[20:06:01] <robertmaxrees> could be a string.
[20:06:04] <robertmaxrees> could be the date
[20:06:13] <tables> what string do i put there?
[20:06:18] <tables> you'd have to show me in fiddle
[20:06:20] <tables> i'm confused
[20:06:21] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:06:22] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[20:06:27] <robertmaxrees> have you ever written JS?
[20:06:29] <tables> no
[20:06:30] <tables> lol
[20:06:34] <tables> i'm new to javascript too
[20:06:37] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[20:06:44] <robertmaxrees> that explains a lot ^ check this guide out.
[20:07:08] <robertmaxrees> gotta crawl before you can walk.
[20:08:16] <robertmaxrees> let's start with this: you said you wanted to append date=whatever to the url, right?
[20:08:23] <sillyslux> also learn https://developer.chrome.com/devtools or https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en
[20:08:42] <robertmaxrees> or just use fixingthesejquery.com and learn about all three dev tools at once :)
[20:08:57] <robertmaxrees> but debuggers and the console aren't really helpful if you don't know any js.
[20:09:24] <tables> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf71utd9/4/ <-- how can i make this go to the page instead of alerting it?
[20:10:05] <robertmaxrees> let's start by building the url you want.
[20:10:16] <robertmaxrees> also: use your console instead of alerts.

[20:50:54] <jiffe> alright so here is my example: http://nsab.us/public/jquery/
[20:51:22] <jiffe> so the select field is going to be dependent on whats in the text field
[20:51:48] <jiffe> so if I type something in the text field and then click on the select field, I need to populate that select field sometime in between that action
[20:52:46] <jiffe> using the blur() method of the text field, clicking on the select field still drops down an empty list, if I close and reopen the select, the items then show
[20:52:59] <jiffe> so I'm not sure how to fix that
[21:06:22] <sillyslux> you could disable that select until ajax finishes
[21:07:30] <jiffe> I don't think I want to disable it
[21:07:55] <jiffe> I'm looking for a smooth transition going from typing in the text box to clicking on the select, with a delay while the select box loads
[21:09:53] <sillyslux> to delay the users click on select you'd have to http://stackoverflow.com/a/20906852
[22:09:13] <GeekMonkey> is there a jquery function that allows me to know if the person came from outside url
[22:09:54] <systemfault> Not really, only the server-side would know and only if the user hasn't disabled the REFERER HTTP header.
[22:10:25] <GeekMonkey> what if we modified the url?
[22:11:13] <GeekMonkey> mysite.com/?referral=email
[22:12:30] <systemfault> Then sure
[22:12:49] <GeekMonkey> how would I do that??? :-D
[22:14:37] <systemfault> parse window.location.search
[22:14:59] <GeekMonkey> search?
[22:15:06] <GeekMonkey> $(location).attr('href');
[22:15:18] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't do that.
[22:15:51] <systemfault> If the user goes to mysite.com/?referral=email    then window.location.search will be equal to    ?referral=email
[22:18:23] <bberry> If i have a File type from a file reader and i need to send an ajax PUT request to an external server (aws), can i just do ajax({ url: 'someurl.com', method: 'PUT',
[22:18:35] <bberry> data: myFile })
[22:20:36] <bberry> docs dont really mention anything about doing that sort of thing...  The functionality im trying to mimic is like this.... http://hastebin.com/jicazoxijo.js
[22:24:48] <GeekMonkey> systemfault... yup that works perfect thanks
[22:24:55] <systemfault> GeekMonkey: Great :)
[22:26:15] <systemfault> bberry: Perhaps you can if you set data: myFile, processData: false and perhaps by adding a contentType
[22:26:24] <systemfault> bberry: jQuery wasn't designed for XHR2.
[22:27:10] <bberry> gotcha.  I think im just gonna wrap the vanilla js in a fn and have a cb param, or Promise or something
[22:27:21] <systemfault> Great
[22:37:01] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to get it if the url matches... then simulate button click
[22:37:13] <GeekMonkey> I want a certain modal popup to come up

[22:46:04] <GeekMonkey> is not working
