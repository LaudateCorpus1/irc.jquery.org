[10:46:29] <Toerkeium> Hello everyone
[10:48:54] <Toerkeium> do you know how can I accomplish this? https://pastebin.com/LHVeGCPR without receiving the error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name" after clicking on "Aceptar" button
[13:31:00] <AdamPDotty> Toerkeium: Check what you get back for your "confirm" function! I guess okAction is empty.
[13:34:08] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium for starters, don't attach event handlers like that.
[13:35:49] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium do something like this instead: https://bpaste.net/V37Q
[13:36:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're still having issues, then your problem lies elsewhere.
