[04:26:09] <sine0> thykka: are you here, god of jquery
[04:26:29] <sine0> Cork: is god of jquery also
[04:27:23] <sine0> I need help debugging my page
[04:48:18] <sine0> what is the best way to deal with multiple plugins all wanting to use a different version of jQuery and pulling it in themselves
[04:48:52] <Cork> nag the developers of the plugins to not embed jquery in jquery plugins
[04:49:00] <Cork> cause it is a terrible idea
[04:49:09] <Cork> cause as website developer you can't deal with it
[04:49:31] <Cork> except possibly by embedding each plugin in its own iframe
[04:51:18] <sine0> so the answer is, no.
[04:53:09] <Cork> well there is a second option, that i prob would choose if i really needed the plugin
[04:53:20] <Cork> i would fork it and remove all auto inclution of jquery
[04:53:48] <Cork> (and instead depend/require the website admin to include what is required for the plugin to work)
[05:04:38] <solsTiCe> hi. Is there a way (a plugin or whatever) to check that my jquery code does not use a css id that is not (anymore) in html ?
[05:05:32] <Cork> that is very VERY hard to do, as html can be added/rmoeved from ajax responses or generated
[05:09:22] <solsTiCe> even just the original html at least
[05:09:48] <avernos> is it possible to refresh / reload when refocusing on a tab ?
[05:10:05] <Cork> i mean it wouldn't give much help for a lot of projects, heck i don't think i have a single project that it would help any
[05:10:23] <Cork> avernos: refresh the entire page?
[05:10:43] <solsTiCe> avernos: I am using document.visibilityState
[05:10:54] <solsTiCe> Cork: this is for debugging.
[05:11:03] <solsTiCe> or double check change I made
[05:11:07] <avernos> Cork, hopefully not, rather some contents. but im up for any
[05:11:22] <avernos> solsTiCe, thanks, ill take a look :D
[05:11:44] <solsTiCe> $(document).on('visibilitychange', function() {
[05:11:44] <solsTiCe>     if (document.visibilityState == 'visible') {
[05:11:44] <solsTiCe>       $('#refresh').trigger('click'); // use the same code than above
[05:11:44] <solsTiCe>     }
[05:11:44] <solsTiCe>   });
[05:11:55] <Cork> don't dump multi lines in the channel...
[05:12:03] <avernos> wow, thanks much appreciated
[05:12:05] <solsTiCe> yeah.
[05:12:26] <solsTiCe> sorry. it was only 4 of them
[05:12:33] <avernos> did some browsing, got a bunch of 2011 stuff that was quite a bit misleading and got me thinking wasnt easy
[05:19:05] <Cork> avernos: you could do it with requestAnimationFrame
[05:19:52] <Cork> but ya, you will always have to detect the state through different means
[05:20:20] <avernos> i guess keyword for state is visibility
[06:40:12] <sine0> I managed to unload one of the 6 instances of jQuery running and it fixed the site..
[06:40:45] <sine0> might as well just run the latest imo and get rid of all the others
[06:54:11] <diverdude> Hi, I have selected a collection of jquery objects using jquery css selector. Now i want to iterate through all the objects in the selection and build a dictionary from these. The obvious way would be to call .each(...) on the collection, but my problem is that i need to use the resulting dict for an ajax call. Thus i have to wait for the each to finish b4 i do the ajax call. How do I do that?
[06:59:16] <pavonia> diverdude: What the problem exactly? .each() is synchronous
[06:59:27] <pavonia> *What's
[06:59:52] <diverdude> pavonia: are you sure? i think its async
[07:00:36] <pavonia> Pretty sure, though the documentation doesn't mention it explicitly
[07:00:54] <diverdude> pavonia: i think its async
[07:01:05] <pavonia> Why do you think that?
[07:02:19] <diverdude> pavonia: moment i will test again
[07:02:22] <pavonia> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7371942/is-jquery-each-function-synchronous
[07:06:42] <Cork> pavonia: but ajax isn't
[07:07:24] <Cork> diverdude: you have a few options inject placeholders for each element to response when you get them back
[07:07:30] <Cork> then the order doesn't matter
[07:07:59] <Cork> or make a recursive function loop (that processes the next element when the previous ajax call comes back)
[07:09:33] <pavonia> Cork: Unless I misunderstand the question, the AJAX request isn't related to the problem
[07:10:16] <Cork> hmm, possibly
[07:22:35] <diverdude> pavonia: ok i stand corrected. Thanks
[07:26:07] <diverdude> Hi, I am using the following to get the classlist from a jquery object: $(val).prop("classList")   However i need to edit the resulting list without editing the DOM. How do i make a copy of the list?
[07:34:10] <diverdude> I tried using .clone but it seems like not working
[07:37:05] <Cork> diverdude: firstly don't modify classList use.addClass/removeClass
[07:37:18] <Cork> diverdude: secondsly why do you need to make a change not visible in the dom?
[07:38:12] <diverdude> Cork: because i need to use a class as an identifier on serverside. So i am sending it to the server. However i want to first remove other classes in the list
[07:38:32] <Cork> diverdude: don't
[07:38:38] <Cork> use .data() and store the reference there
[07:38:39] <diverdude> Cork: why?
[07:38:48] <Cork> don't use class="" as your data storage attribute
[07:39:16] <diverdude> Cork: but i am also using it to reference the element. I can use it for multiple things
[07:39:51] <Cork> diverdude: ya, but you shouldn't treet the class attribute as something your current code is the only thing touching
[07:40:13] <Cork> that will make extending the site in a few years annoyingly super hard
[07:40:30] <diverdude> Cork: thats true?
[07:40:33] <diverdude> -?
[07:41:01] <Cork> i've been there taking over after other that does $().attr('class
[07:41:12] <Cork> *i've been there taking over after other that does $().attr('class', 'active')
[07:41:26] <Cork> and my "nice-style" class gettings removed all the time
[07:41:38] <Cork> making adding features impossible
[07:41:49] <diverdude> yes that makes sense
[08:26:27] <thykka> eyy
[19:03:23] <sine0> I think I had this nailed before.. but how do I get a list of children and then delay in adding a class, this i what I have so far with .each: https://bpaste.net/show/b1ece22c9538
[19:03:48] <robertmaxrees> you need to create an animation queue for .delay()
[19:03:56] <robertmaxrees> you can use the native setTimeout instead.
[19:04:18] <sine0> ok cool
[19:04:39] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting it to do it to all of them at once?
[19:04:41] <robertmaxrees> or one at a time?
[19:05:45] <sine0> one at a time
[19:07:27] <robertmaxrees> that's a little more difficult.
[19:07:53] <sine0> but whys o why, seems like it would be a common request :d
[19:09:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
