[01:49:19] <stanmancan> I have a site with an image gallery and the images are pretty big, I was thinking it would be best to load the site and once the site is done loading then start loading the pictures in the background
[01:53:56] <MACscr> Shouldnt this work for a input field with the corresponding id? $('#mascot_name').val('foobar');

[07:29:01] <hirsty> hey all, anyone used the mbtooltip ext? if so, any clue how to get it working on touch?
[07:29:42] <hirsty> tried touchend, focus touch events with no luck - linked up to an <a>
[07:39:27] <Mark____> can anyone tell me why im getting this error? Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('https://www.youtube.com') does not match the recipient window's origin ('http://lifeto.cafe24.com').
[07:40:01] <hirsty> Cross Origin controls maybe @Mark____

[07:51:49] <juslintek> Hi, how to kill action binded by showHideAjaxContainer on http://www.kiekreikia.lt/ fancybox held ajax container. Trying advisionPortfolioContainer.find('.eg-ajax-closer').die('click'), dvisionPortfolioContainer.find('.eg-ajax-closer').off('click'). It doesn't work. I do it before binding new event function on click.
[07:52:57] <juslintek> Because now ajax container closer closes only ajax container and I want to close fancybox, so I need to bind new action on that element and kill old one. Or maybe make them work together.
[07:55:42] <mcfdez87> Hello. Anyone has used x-editable plugin? I combined it with select2 and when I select an option of the dropdown the data-value is filled with a string "object Object". Any suggestion please?
[08:02:53] <Mark____> could anyone help me installing infinite scrolling js inside of iframe? im having a bit of a problem here. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35270213/installing-infinite-scroll-within-iframe
[08:04:58] <jmdrawneek> Any idea why a if ($(this).attr("aria-expanded", "true")) would be true is this has aria-expanded=false? http://pastebin.com/JgDTPv4x
[08:05:41] <hirsty> -shivers at the metion of frames-
[08:23:11] <sigdk> this shouldn't be hard... why is the validate() called "multiple" times ? I want to do it only on submit: https://jsfiddle.net/L75q0452/2/
[08:25:17] <shoky> jmdrawneek: that sets it to true.  guess you want   if ($(this).attr("aria-expanded") === "true")
[08:26:23] <jmdrawneek> shoky: Thanks for answering. Eventually saw my error.
[08:29:01] <shoky> sigdk: you can set onclick,onkeyup,onfocusout options to false
[08:48:43] <Mark____> could anyone help me installing infinite scrolling js within iframe? im having a bit of problem.
[09:04:30] <shoky> Mark____: maybe something like this..?  var ifrm = jQuery('#window_frame');
[09:04:30] <shoky> ifrm[0].contentWindow.jQuery(ifrm.contents().find('body')).jscroll(...)
[09:04:43] <Mark____> um… what’s that?
[09:05:26] <shoky> a possible solution? assuming the iframe is in the same origin
[09:05:44] <shoky> and that you want to run the jscroll on the <body> element. otherwise you can change the .find('body')
[09:07:18] <Mark____> whoa that’s beyond my understanding of the jquery
[09:07:19] <Mark____> sec/
[09:07:39] <Mark____> have you already checked out my problematic website?
[09:08:03] <Mark____> and could you be more specific as to how i can use that code you pasted?
[09:08:08] <shoky> yes. that code seems to maybe sorta do some infinite scrolling on your iframe, but hard to tell
[09:08:35] <shoky> Mark____  you can run that code when you want to run the jscroll on your iframe
[09:08:59] <shoky> btw why not just run it inside the iframe page itself ?
[09:10:09] <Mark____> i already tried using this code on the page that gets loaded inside the iframe. https://jsfiddle.net/ecvngasg/
[09:10:15] <Mark____> and i got error
[09:10:21] <Mark____> cross origin.
[09:10:28] <shoky> huh
[09:10:50] <shoky> if it runs from inside that page then there shouldn't be any cross origin issue.. especially if it's not on a different origin :)
[09:11:07] <Mark____> yeah.
[09:11:14] <shoky> where did you put that code exactly
[09:11:15] <Mark____> i’ll give it one more try then..
[09:11:20] <Mark____> um sc.
[09:11:21] <Mark____> sec.
[09:11:22] <shoky> k
[09:11:45] <Mark____> so basically,the iframe is inside the .window div that appears when you click on the ‘공지사항’ on the bottom of this website : http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[09:11:55] <Mark____> the iframe loads a CMS board
[09:12:27] <Mark____> and i put the jscroll.js and initialization code inside that board.
[09:12:34] <Mark____> i think i’ll try to give it one more try see if you can do something from there.
[09:15:29] <shoky> Mark____ your iframe's html is all messed up..
[09:15:40] <Mark____> yeah i just checked that
[09:15:45] <Mark____> don’t know what’s causing it though
[09:15:48] <shoky> Mark____  you have  <script>  that starts the .jscroll but it doesnt finish
[09:15:56] <Mark____> sec.
[09:16:41] <imox> hello, I use the bootstrap datepicker http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/events.html but on the changeDate event the event will fired twice
[09:17:16] <Mark____> okay, now i fixed it by pasting those lines inside a js file and linking it to the html file.
[09:17:23] <Mark____> but no js function.
[09:20:56] <shoky> Mark____ .board_content  doesn't have any content
[09:21:21] <Mark____> it’s an empty div that i created just so the contents actually go into that div
[09:21:23] <Mark____> but sec…
[09:21:53] <shoky> you need to run the scroll thing on the right container..
[09:22:40] <Mark____> hmm..
[09:22:55] <Mark____> what div would that be though?
[09:23:42] <Mark____> maybe i should create a wrapper or something.
[09:24:32] <Mark____> nope, still dont’ work.
[09:24:39] <shoky> Mark____ it needs to be a container which contains the items and the "next" button, etc.. otherwise how do you expect jscroll to find them
[09:24:51] <Mark____> hmm.
[09:25:16] <Mark____> i thought it can find it because it’s all in the same document, no?
[09:25:19] <Mark____> but i guess not.
[09:25:30] <Mark____> sorry. still learning things/
[09:25:31] <shoky> it's for scrolling a certain element, not the whole document
[09:26:01] <Mark____> every line you type doesn’t quite strike me in the right direction but i see what you are saying.
[09:26:06] <Mark____> but the div won’t work.
[09:26:09] <Mark____> any suggestion?
[09:26:19] <shoky> .board maybe, donno
[09:26:31] <Mark____> sec..
[09:26:40] <shoky> thought you already know how to get jscroll working on a regular page
[09:26:55] <shoky> i've never used it myself
[09:26:59] <Mark____> it’s working.
[09:27:00] <Mark____> but,
[09:27:02] <Mark____> sec...
[09:27:13] <Mark____> i did. i just didnt have to think too hard on it
[09:28:19] <Mark____> okay, .board works, but it screws up the pagination once it loads one additional content
[09:28:25] <Mark____> i don’t even know where that .board comes from .. sec
[09:31:55] <Mark____> oh well,
[09:32:01] <Mark____> at least it works. *half
[09:32:09] <Mark____> thanks for the help. shoky
[09:32:18] <shoky> jscroll wont just magically work on any html/layout
[09:32:39] <shoky> np
[09:33:14] <Mark____> now i gotta figure out why it messes up with the pagination.. ha
[09:33:20] <hellyeah> hey
[09:34:10] <Mark____> hi hellyeah
[09:34:15] <hellyeah> pls check line 147 - line 150 select dates then click pencil button there is an infinite loop or smt like that why is that? http://jsfiddle.net/1ndnqchu/25/
[09:34:24] <Mark____> not good at jquery sorry.
[09:34:29] <hellyeah> nope
[09:34:40] <hellyeah> thanks anyway :=)
[09:34:41] <taplar> make a smaller fiddle
[09:35:18] <shoky> hellyeah uhh
[09:35:22] <hellyeah> sure there is lots of functionality i will try that
[09:35:23] <shoky> hellyeah you can find this out yourself
[09:35:38] <shoky> if you have an infinite while loop, then the while condition is staying true
[09:35:40] <hellyeah> ye
[09:35:42] <hellyeah> :X
[09:35:48] <shoky> dont ask for help on such a trivial issue :\
[09:35:52] <shoky> wasting people's time
[09:36:02] <shoky> just read your code
[09:36:05] <shoky> line by line
[09:36:10] <shoky> is everything correct?
[09:37:33] <shoky> are you doing something to cause the while condition to change?
[09:38:10] <hellyeah> actually that must work http://jsfiddle.net/1ndnqchu/26/
[09:38:15] <hellyeah> okey i am sorry for that
[09:38:26] <shoky> because?
[09:38:33] <shoky> are you doing anything to change the while condition?
[09:38:40] <hellyeah> yeah
[09:38:46] <shoky> what?
[09:38:49] <hellyeah> ops
[09:38:53] <shoky> ops.
[09:38:53] <hellyeah> just a sec
[09:39:02] <hellyeah> no ye
[09:39:09] <hellyeah> i increase tempvalue 1
[09:39:14] <shoky> where are you doing that?
[09:39:32] <hellyeah> line 150
[09:39:42] <shoky> temp + 1   ?
[09:39:42] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/1ndnqchu/27/
[09:39:46] <hellyeah> yes
[09:39:50] <shoky> that doesn't increase anything
[09:39:53] <hellyeah> suck
[09:39:55] <hellyeah> my bad
[09:40:07] <shoky> also  you can't just add 1 to a date
[09:40:18] <shoky> you can setDate if you want to change it
[09:40:19] <hellyeah> getDate() give me a number
[09:40:23] <taplar> 1 what? day?  hour?  minute?
[09:40:44] <hellyeah> i suppose getDate give me day value hmm i am mistaken
[09:41:22] <shoky> hellyeah yea sorry so they are numbers not dates here, but you don't want that..
[09:41:32] <shoky> 1 <= 30
[09:41:42] <shoky> but  1st of february >= 30th of january
[09:42:06] <shoky> anyways if you want to increase a date by one day  date.setDate(date.getDate() + 1)
[09:42:17] <shoky> but  just doing     x + 1;
[09:42:29] <shoky> won't cut it ;p
[09:43:42] <hellyeah> okey there is no infinite loop now
[09:43:43] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:48:04] <hellyeah> i will do smaler fiddle :XD
[09:48:26] <taplar> +1
[09:48:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:48:55] <hellyeah> i guess i need to eliminate extra functionality
[09:49:06] <hellyeah> i need minimal functionality for that
[09:49:26] <hellyeah> hmm but this time can you look line 147-150 why it didnt give me the range http://jsfiddle.net/1ndnqchu/31/
[09:50:19] <hellyeah> i think while must be execute for times
[09:51:16] <hellyeah> just execute one time
[09:51:23] <taplar> smaaaaaaaler......fiiiiiiiidddddllllleeeeee
[09:51:33] <Mark____> um,
[09:52:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am at work i promise i will do at home :p
[09:52:25] <taplar> this isn't work then?
[09:52:38] <hellyeah> this fiddle?
[09:52:41] <taplar> yup
[09:53:09] <hellyeah> it works just one time
[09:53:10] <shoky> hellyeah i didnt understand your question..
[09:53:25] <shoky> "it didnt give me the range" ?
[09:53:31] <shoky> who is supposed to give you a range
[09:53:34] <shoky> how
[09:53:53] <hellyeah> while(temp <= to){
[09:54:01] <hellyeah> temp is smaller or equal to "to"
[09:54:02] <shoky> all you're doing is setting temp to  "from" date, and increasing it until it is not smaller than "to" date
[09:54:07] <hellyeah> console temp
[09:54:19] <hellyeah> and increase temp check again
[09:54:46] <hellyeah> and console.log(temp)
[09:54:56] <hellyeah> so i increased temp right
[09:55:11] <hellyeah> it must be 8 Feb, 9 Feb, 10 Feb, 11 Feb
[09:55:38] <shoky> hellyeah:  temp.setDate(temp.getDate + 1);
[09:55:41] <hellyeah> damn
[09:55:46] <hellyeah> i saw it now
[09:55:55] <sigdk> why does jfiddle complain when I try to add this: http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.1.1/css/bootstrap-combined.min.css ?
[09:55:59] <hellyeah> shoky: this is not excusze
[09:56:18] <hellyeah> dont get me wrong i just have 70 percentage loss in my seeing perspective
[09:56:24] <hellyeah> but i am sorry for that
[09:56:26] <hellyeah> really sorry
[09:56:55] <hellyeah> it is okey now
[09:56:56] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:01:07] <hellyeah> yehahaha
[10:02:00] <sigdk> I'm trying to create an elementary example with validate, yet it fails: https://jsfiddle.net/L75q0452/7/   Any hints are highly appreciated
[10:02:38] <hellyeah> sigdk:why not "required" ?
[10:03:09] <sigdk> excuse me ?
[10:03:52] <hellyeah> html5 has reqired attribute
[10:04:00] <hellyeah> probably that will work for you
[10:04:10] <hellyeah> but you may need something else
[10:04:20] <sigdk> hellyeah, and avoid the validate ?
[10:04:33] <hellyeah> well iirc
[10:04:39] <hellyeah> if input box is empty
[10:04:50] <hellyeah> it should avoid to you proceed further
[10:04:52] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/L75q0452/9/
[10:05:00] <hellyeah> but check the docs
[10:05:36] <hellyeah> that can help you http://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/html5-form-validation/
[10:07:43] <sigdk> nah... I have already a plugin, I want to do also other sort of validations
[10:08:54] <hellyeah> server side?
[10:13:54] <hellyeah> i know it is really simple can you check line 151 why it gave me an error http://jsfiddle.net/1ndnqchu/34/
[10:14:04] <hellyeah> or find method only get "class"
[10:15:39] <taplar_busy> are you appending the clone to the body at some point?
[10:17:17] <taplar_busy> yep.  so ids are unique on a page
[10:17:40] <hellyeah> i guess forgot that
[10:17:50] <hellyeah> thats why i used clone constantly
[10:17:51] <hellyeah> :P:P:P
[10:17:59] <taplar_busy> how would that fix that?
[10:18:20] <DFar> Hello, i'm stuck with my menu in jqm listview, it display "normaly"  but when i press goback on an iphone the page became empty. someone could help me ?
[10:18:29] <hellyeah> well
[10:18:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:18:46] <hellyeah> well
[10:19:40] <hellyeah> $('body').append(clone) or clone.clone().appendTo('body');
[10:19:47] <hellyeah> i am really confused at that
[10:19:54] <hellyeah> first one seems work
[10:21:13] <hellyeah> i guess i need to clean up this mess when i get home
[10:21:18] <hellyeah> and properly documented
[10:21:22] <Mark____> you are learning fast though
[10:21:26] <hellyeah> at least i got somewhere
[10:21:29] <taplar_busy> self-document
[10:21:43] <taplar_busy> clone.clone()
[10:21:44] <Mark____> last time i saw you, you didn’t know anything about the jquery just throwing yourself into anything
[10:21:44] <hellyeah> i remember self-document means
[10:21:45] <taplar_busy> wtf?
[10:21:51] <hellyeah> variable name, function name
[10:21:56] <Mark____> but now it seems like you leaned a lot.
[10:22:07] <hellyeah> taplar_busy: wtf to me?
[10:22:12] <taplar_busy> yup
[10:22:25] <hellyeah> taplar_busy: did i say something wrong?
[10:22:32] <hellyeah> did i do something wrong?
[10:22:36] <taplar_busy> read my statement before that
[10:22:49] <hellyeah> :P:P:P
[10:22:56] <hellyeah> appendTo().clone()
[10:22:59] <hellyeah> it is
[10:23:09] <hellyeah> my memory is silly sometimes sorry
[10:23:14] <Mark____> anyways nighty night
[10:23:28] <hellyeah> Mark____:
[10:23:33] <hellyeah> i am kinda fast learner
[10:23:39] <Mark____> good.
[10:23:45] <Mark____> impicking few things up as well
[10:23:46] <hellyeah> except i am doing some rubbish time to time
[10:23:56] <Mark____> maybe too many times.
[10:24:00] <hellyeah> i plan to read eloquent javascript again
[10:24:28] <hellyeah> Mark____: doin silly things are also important
[10:24:39] <taplar_busy> not really
[10:24:42] <hellyeah> it show you have enough encourage for learning stuff
[10:24:51] <hellyeah> taplar_busy: dont agree with me
[10:24:55] <hellyeah> he knows better
[10:24:57] <taplar_busy> it means you need to read your code more, :P
[10:25:05] <hellyeah> also that
[10:25:06] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:25:20] <taplar_busy> doesn't matter what you think it does.  only what it does do
[10:25:25] <hellyeah> taplar_busy: sometimes my mind manipulates me to type wrong things
[10:26:07] <hellyeah> taplar_busy: you are really busy certainly
[10:26:12] <hellyeah> you are in big project?
[10:26:50] <hellyeah> anyway gotta go

[11:35:01] <graphettion> It seems every time I try it on our site, it doesn't work.
[11:35:03] <markh> /quit
[11:35:06] <taplar_busy> lol
[11:35:26] <graphettion> I'll try again. :P
[11:35:38] <markh> caught red handed
[11:37:23] <graphettion> like confucious
[11:37:23] <rapha> NoiseEee: I'm not talking about <input type=file> or a local file. I've recorded some audio through getUserMedia (for which the user already had to give permission) and now I want to upload that binary data through a hidden input field.
[11:38:40] <NoiseEee> rapha: and you don't want to send it right away?
[11:39:07] <DFar> Is someone available for jquery mobile misunderstanding ?
[11:39:12] <NoiseEee> rapha: ie: not XHR for some reason?
[11:39:24] <taplar_busy> i can provide many missunderstandings
[11:39:31] <taplar_busy> i'm like a pro
[11:39:48] <graphettion> taplar_busy: That example compares the text to the tag elements when filtering. Is there any way to just sort it using tags (no comparison)
[11:40:19] <taplar_busy> not sure i understand the question
[11:41:03] <graphettion> Let's say every row has the same tag number
[11:41:10] <graphettion> I want to categorize those rows
[11:41:23] <graphettion> row 1 has data-tags="1"
[11:41:26] <graphettion> etc.
[11:41:48] <taplar_busy> ah, no clue.  not that familiar with isotope
[11:42:12] <taplar_busy> but as I showed in the fiddle, it seems like you want your tags to be the tags themselves, not their position in the original array
[11:42:13] <graphettion> np, I'm just trying to figure out how to filter it like that because the site is using partials.
[11:42:54] <DFar> I have a jqm listview menu loaded by ajax, when i press goback on iOS, my listview is not .ui-page-active, and not showing. Any Idea, Thanks
[11:42:57] <graphettion> well, I'm trying to understand what we have and what I can do on JSFiddle to isolate the problem.
[11:43:03] <graphettion> That doesn't seem to be working though.
[11:43:04] <graphettion> lol
[11:43:43] <graphettion> I appreciate your help though. It has got me to understand the problem more.
[11:44:07] <taplar_busy> cool
[11:44:27] <rapha> NoiseEee: no. The thing is that the object it is bound to might be new (i.e., not exist yet on the server). So if I would send it through XHR, then I would have to do extra work. Sending it along with the rest of the form would be easier.
[11:45:06] <NoiseEee> rapha: im not sure thats possible.  i'd upload it right away, create a token on the server, and send the token back so the form knows which file to associate it with
[11:45:17] <NoiseEee> rapha: i do a similar thing w/ file uploads over XHR and needing to know more about them
[11:50:03] <rapha> NoiseEee: I used a thing called MediaStreamRecorder before which I'm abandoning for RecorderJS because the former is not maintained any more. BUT the one thing that worked beautifully before was uploading the recorded audio to the server, and the did it with a hidden input field. So I'm pretty sure it's possible, just haven't yet figured out what the secret sauce is.
[11:50:20] <NoiseEee> ahh ok rapha good luck
[11:50:40] <rapha> NoiseEee: if you think on it, why would it not be possible? You can send any random string through a hidden input field. So why not encode binary data as such a string...
[11:50:47] <NoiseEee> right i suppose
[11:51:06] * rapha has an idea
[11:51:16] <robertmaxrees> how much data?
[11:51:31] <rapha> robertmaxrees: somewhere in the vincinity of 50kB
[12:25:12] <rapha> NoiseEee: so I figured it out ... you just use a FileReader to base64-encode the Blob.
[12:25:31] <NoiseEee> thanks for the followup rapha
[12:28:09] <rapha> sure :)
[13:14:03] <s34n> how can I post raw content without field names via jQuery.post?
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> serialize it or otherwise figure out a way to construct a custom post body?
[13:15:32] <s34n> robertmaxrees: I have constructed the post body. But when I $.post it, jquery uses it as a field name =""
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean by that?
[13:15:56] <robertmaxrees> and maybe show what you're doing?
[13:16:37] <s34n> if I $.post('/somewhere', 'rawcontent'), jquery posts rawcontent="" to /somewhere
[13:16:53] <robertmaxrees> right, as a querystring param.  you want is as apart of the postbody?
[13:17:38] <s34n> I want the post body to be "rawcontent"
[13:19:13] <robertmaxrees> i always just use $.ajax() and make processData: false or whatever it is.
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> since you can't change that flag using $.post() i don't think.
[13:20:31] <robertmaxrees> at least not until 3.0 comes out.
[13:21:43] <s34n> the docs say that strings don't get processed, but mine gets processed
[13:22:15] <robertmaxrees> where on http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ does it say that?
[13:23:32] <s34n> under 'data'
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> "
[13:23:45] <robertmaxrees> A plain object or string that is sent to the server with the request.
[13:23:49] <s34n> "It is converted to a query string, if not already a string."
[13:24:08] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that on the post string.
[13:24:12] <robertmaxrees> err, post page.
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean on $.ajax()
[13:25:00] <s34n> ah. yeah. thx
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> try using $.ajax() directly instead.
[13:43:38] <graphettion> It doesn't work - https://jsfiddle.net/x9oxwcjj/18/ :(
[13:45:46] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot going on in there.
[13:46:06] <graphettion> mhm, lots of newb code
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> so... one step at a time.
[13:46:16] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[13:46:35] <graphettion> There's a list in the database that I would like to filter.
[13:46:46] <graphettion> I identify those items by the tag attribute and a number.
[13:47:04] <graphettion> I'm trying to filter them as categories.
[13:47:14] <robertmaxrees> you have like 4 different libraries going on at once here.
[13:47:25] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap, jqui, isotope, and tokenfield
[13:47:43] <graphettion> I don't think they are conflicting in code.
[13:47:53] <robertmaxrees> it can though ;)
[13:47:58] <graphettion> true
[13:49:09] <robertmaxrees> pair things down as much as possible.
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> like, solve one problem at a time.
[13:50:48] <graphettion> I think I am. I'm using this example - http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/nFrte
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> notice how that example only loads two things?
[13:55:36] <graphettion> what two things?
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> click "settings" in the top right and then the javascript tab in that modal.
[13:57:01] <graphettion> jquery 2.2.0
[13:57:06] <robertmaxrees> and isotope.
[13:58:25] <graphettion> I only see Frameworks and Extensions: jQuery
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> click "external resources" on the left.
[13:59:39] <graphettion> I'm on it.
[14:05:13] <graphettion> Oh, I mean I did that.
[14:05:19] <graphettion> Clicked JavaScript setting
[14:05:22] <graphettion> jQuery 2.2.0
[14:05:34] <robertmaxrees> right, you also have a ton of other external resources included.
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> get rid of everything but isotope.
[14:06:11] <graphettion> The website uses tokenfield to browse categories
[14:06:25] <robertmaxrees> are you setting up isotope or tokenfield right now?
[14:07:10] <graphettion> I'm working on a website that does. I'm not sure what you're getting at.
[14:07:32] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle you're messing with is to setup isotope, so just include isotope and what you need there.
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of all libraries for your site - those are irrelevant.  you jsut want jquery and isotope for your fiddle right now.
[14:08:01] <graphettion> kk
[14:08:42] <graphettion> https://jsfiddle.net/x9oxwcjj/19/ - done
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:09:31] <graphettion> :P
[14:09:34] <robertmaxrees> back up for a sec.
[14:09:36] <graphettion> I'll fix it
[14:09:38] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish here?
[14:09:50] <graphettion> sort by categories via numbers
[14:10:00] <robertmaxrees> what does tokenfield have to do with this?
[14:10:13] <graphettion> data-category="1" if I have three of these guys, I want them to show
[14:10:29] <robertmaxrees> rght, so you want to use isotope for filtering?
[14:10:52] <graphettion> Yes, the database uses knockout js to get the tags from the database
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> the DB has nothing to do with what the js is doing btw.
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:11:14] <graphettion> true
[14:11:48] <graphettion> They are using the token for the user to insert tags into the input field
[14:11:50] <graphettion> then sort them
[14:12:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.  start with your isotope setup first.  get that working.
[14:12:10] <robertmaxrees> then focus on tokenfield.
[14:12:57] <graphettion> Not sure how to get isotope working without selecting a tag to identify the filtering
[14:13:08] <graphettion> Do I type something in the input box?
[14:13:17] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[14:13:39] <graphettion> that should be easy enough then
[14:13:50] <robertmaxrees> check out the isotope docs
[14:35:12] <omenius> http://pastebin.com/GazRHpcH
[14:35:35] <omenius> is there something wrong here? I't works with brackets live view (chrome), but not outside brackets
[14:36:08] <robertmaxrees> assuming the markup is good, should be fine.
[14:36:32] <omenius> everything else works, but inside $(document).ready(function(){}) nothing works
[14:36:42] <omenius> okay
[14:37:00] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[14:38:21] <omenius> yeah, It fails to get one js script, tablesorter that sorts one table
[14:38:33] <robertmaxrees> that would break things.
[14:39:07] <omenius> yeah, I will try to fix this. Ty for help
[14:40:57] <graphettion> The docs says this should work - https://jsfiddle.net/x9oxwcjj/21/ - http://isotope.metafizzy.co/v1/docs/sorting.html
[14:41:39] <robertmaxrees> wrong docs.
[14:42:00] <graphettion> Alright, I hit the fail button.
[14:42:02] <graphettion> lol
[14:42:07] <robertmaxrees> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering.html
[14:42:14] <robertmaxrees> the ones you linked to are for v1.  you're using v2.
[14:42:41] <omenius> robertmaxrees: you are the man, the site works now :)
[14:42:41] <graphettion> errr! I'll get this one day!
[14:42:47] <robertmaxrees> omenius deffo.
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> graphettion also: use .data() for data attributes.
[14:43:21] <robertmaxrees> not .attr()
[14:43:32] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/data/ for some good info.
[14:51:51] <graphettion> Man, I suck at this. lol
[14:52:01] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[14:52:15] <graphettion> I really don't know what to do - https://jsfiddle.net/x9oxwcjj/22/
[14:52:32] <robertmaxrees> are you currently just trying to filter things?
[14:52:52] <graphettion> I figured out sorting is probably best for categories.
[14:53:01] <graphettion> Since isotope JS has a sorting feature
[14:53:21] <graphettion> So I'm trying to sort the data tag.
[14:55:17] <graphettion> It looks so simple but it's really hard for me.
[14:55:22] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want to on the data attribute?
[14:56:27] <graphettion> yeah, sort the data-category
[14:57:32] <graphettion> But when I type Red, I need to associate that to "1"
[14:57:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.
[14:57:40] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:57:43] <robertmaxrees> that changes things.
[14:57:49] <robertmaxrees> are you able to get "1" working for starters?
[14:58:05] <graphettion> no
[14:58:11] <graphettion> I'll try that.
[14:58:14] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:58:18] <robertmaxrees> simplify the problem first.
[14:59:12] <graphettion> I wouldn't even know how to approach that.
[14:59:22] <graphettion> with this sorting thing
[14:59:39] <robertmaxrees> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/sorting.html
[14:59:53] <graphettion> category: '[data-category]'
[14:59:56] <graphettion> using that
[15:00:16] <graphettion> $grid.isotope({ sortBy : 'category' });
[15:00:18] <graphettion> using that
[15:00:30] <robertmaxrees> you need to read the whole page duder.
[15:01:06] <robertmaxrees> you're just slinging around code expecting it to work.
[15:01:32] <graphettion> I know. You're right.
[15:01:45] <graphettion> I've just been working on this for like 3 days.
[15:01:52] <bobdobbs`> take a break
[15:01:55] <bobdobbs`> go for a walk
[15:02:02] <robertmaxrees> take a break, slow down, and read docs first.
[15:02:06] <bobdobbs`> read a comicbook. then come back to it.
[15:02:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're just sort of trying things without understanding what you're doing.
[15:06:09] <graphettion> yeah, I'll take a break
[15:06:10] <graphettion> thanks guys!
[15:37:34] <_twg_> I'm hoping someone can help me.  I have a department that is using Prezi for slideshows.  It has been working fine until last week.  My IT department can't find anything wrong with the browser.  Is there a way that I can invoke the fullscreen mode using jquery/javascript?

[15:40:35] <_twg_> Thanks robertmaxrees
[15:43:05] <Guest77894> Hello :) I try to have a menu like youtube , can someone help me? my problem is the css :) https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=gxqLskGoQN /  https://www.youtube.com/
[15:43:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're having css issues, hit up #css :)
[15:55:15] <bellez> I have my code set up to add a input field when I click on a button however, if there is text in the input field it copies that as well, how can I clear out the input field?
[16:00:51] <_twg_> robertmaxrees: I used the link you sent but when I coded this, http://kopy.io/umzAk#5LGhHBolYI47OG, it did not work at all.  The iframe that the prezi uses is iframe_container .
[16:01:19] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[16:01:40] <_twg_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fullscreenElement' of null
[16:01:46] <robertmaxrees> so fix that first ;)

[17:01:09] <marxe> Hi, I used to toggle a responsive menu but when I aggrandi my browser my items have gone if I did not press the menu that triggers the toggle , an idea of ​​how to make the window wider when the items respawn ?
[17:01:29] <robertmaxrees> "aggrandi"?
[17:01:41] <marxe> expanded
[17:02:16] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're applying things in js based on the window's width - why not use responsive styles instead?
[17:03:46] <marxe> $(".navbar-list").toggle();
[17:03:57] <robertmaxrees> what does the toggle do?
[17:04:50] <marxe> it works but if I open the menu and then closes the window and then expanded my items were missing
[17:05:08] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you mean?
[17:06:59] <marxe> sure https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/
[17:07:11] <robertmaxrees> okay, so how do I replicate your prob;em?
[17:07:52] <marxe> open the menu, close the menu and expanded the window, there are no button login / register
[17:08:18] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah.
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> what's what $(".navbar-list").toggle(); is going to do.
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> it's setting display: none; on those elements.
[17:08:50] <robertmaxrees> you should use css here and add/remove classes explicitly instead of toggling that.
[17:09:01] <marxe> how i can do ?
[17:09:06] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[17:09:24] <marxe> for do that
[17:09:41] <robertmaxrees> there are three parts - which part do you need help with?
[17:09:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:10:22] <marxe> add and remove classes :)

[17:10:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/removeclass/
[17:11:20] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/ is a really good guide btw.
[17:15:31] <marxe> thx
[17:15:33] <marxe> :)
[17:15:52] <z1haze> why does http://dpaste.com/1S0XJWC result to this: https://gyazo.com/d9429a94f290fb47b2ac66820b97b57c please
[17:16:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:16:34] <z1haze> it wont use my variable it literally just uses the text channel
[17:16:36] <z1haze> in socket.on()
[17:16:42] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel.
[17:16:54] <z1haze> how?
[17:17:00] <robertmaxrees> you're askign about vue.
[17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:17:07] <z1haze> im just asking about javascript
[17:17:11] <z1haze> its not specific
[17:17:22] <z1haze> is there anything wrong with my script though
[17:17:26] <z1haze> like scope or anything
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> also, you need to pass this in both functions.
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> the ready AND the socket.
[17:18:12] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't fix it, i have no idea.
[17:18:19] <z1haze> so its a scope issue? even though its declared outside of the vue instance
[17:18:27] <z1haze> it uses the socket variable just fine
[17:18:34] <z1haze> and it doesnt seem to need to be passed in
[17:18:49] <robertmaxrees> wait you mean the channel var?>
[17:19:02] <z1haze> yes
[17:19:11] <z1haze> if you looka t the screenshot its not parsing it..
[17:19:14] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming whether or not it's working as expected?
[17:19:15] <z1haze> its just literally putting channel
[17:19:27] <robertmaxrees> the screenshot is a piucture of the code.
[17:19:34] <robertmaxrees> which is really unhelpful.
[17:19:40] <z1haze> its a picture of the rendered script
[17:19:58] <robertmaxrees> which, as far as I can tell, is identical.
[17:19:59] <bellez> I am still "new" to javascript and jquery. I have figured out a lot on my own but I have a problem with a project. I was wondering, if I have an "admin" page, and they want to down the road add a form field to a page like a log in/creation page... how do I make those changes permanent and not lose it all after they refresh
[17:20:24] <robertmaxrees> bellez you have to send that information to the server and store it somewhere.
[17:20:26] <z1haze> in socket.on() wouldnt you suspect to see 'my-channel' intstead of channel
[17:20:37] <robertmaxrees> z1haze uh... no?
[17:20:44] <bellez> so somehow store it in the database?
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> that's how JS works.
[17:20:48] <robertmaxrees> bellez yeah.
[17:20:58] <z1haze> i see
[17:21:07] <z1haze> i was expecting to to show the rendered value
[17:21:14] <bellez> I have really come to hate databases :(
[17:21:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze huh?
[17:21:21] <robertmaxrees> "rendered value"?
[17:21:33] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't render.
[17:21:43] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not even sure what that means)
[17:21:45] <z1haze> well, thinking of a server side language when you echo variable, it doesnt just print out htevariable name, it prints its value
[17:21:58] <z1haze> i just thought it was the same
[17:22:03] <robertmaxrees> not in the slightest.
[17:22:27] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't render at all.
[17:22:32] <z1haze> right, ok well thanks i should be ok then
[17:22:38] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the idea that server-side languages output HTML.
[17:22:59] <robertmaxrees> javascript can do that, but there's no intermediary before it gets to the browser.  the code you put in a file is the code you'll get out on the other side.
[17:23:02] <z1haze> mm im 'conflating' that they output thevalue of variables
[17:23:12] <z1haze> alright
[17:23:14] <z1haze>  i understand
[17:23:22] <robertmaxrees> conflating is a real word fwiw ;) no need to put it in quotes.
[17:23:51] <z1haze> i know i just dont think thats the right word
[17:23:56] <robertmaxrees> it absolutely is.
[17:24:50] <z1haze> i wasnt trying to combine the ideas, i just literally thought thats how it works, in that case do i just trust that the value being passed in is accurate.. how cna i check?
[17:25:00] <robertmaxrees> you're combining the idea of server-side languages printing values with the idea of how variables in javascript work.
[17:25:05] <robertmaxrees> and you use the console.
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/ is a good guide.
[17:25:24] <z1haze> you at first suggested i bind this to both functions
[17:25:32] <robertmaxrees> i didn't understand the question.
[17:25:37] <z1haze> oh alright
[17:25:37] <robertmaxrees> because you sent two identical screenshots.
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> and i thought you were talking about scope issues.
[17:25:48] <z1haze> yea sorry i got mixed up
[17:25:51] <robertmaxrees> it's cool.
[17:30:18] <marxe> robertmaxrees i'm lost for display my button :/ https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/1/
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:34:46] <robertmaxrees> so your hidden/show classes should be inside of a responsive check in your css.
[17:34:57] <robertmaxrees> also, this is really redundant code.
[17:35:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/okL9xjp1/2/
[17:35:38] <robertmaxrees> still needs cleanup, but you see the issue.
[17:40:10] <marxe> https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/5/
[17:40:25] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what i suggested.
[17:41:16] <marxe> can you show me an example? :)
[17:41:24] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries
[17:42:03] <marxe> yes in my css : @media screen and (max-width: 860px)
[17:42:09] <marxe> line 22
[17:42:44] <quangl> hi
[17:42:56] <robertmaxrees> marxe so first you should use a more generic className.
[17:42:59] <taplar> aloha
[17:43:25] <robertmaxrees> marxe just to make sure it gets asked - have you tried using any of the many available menu libs outthere?
[17:44:09] <marxe> No, I try to do from scratch
[17:44:23] <robertmaxrees> marxe also, your hide/show class needs to be inside the css.
[17:44:29] <robertmaxrees> *inside the media query.
[17:44:55] <MACscr> Am i going about this wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/5r40r5v7/
[17:45:10] <marxe> ok it's done
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> >.> and does it work?
[17:45:52] <robertmaxrees> MACscr afvoid selecting using attributes as much as possibloe.
[17:45:55] <robertmaxrees> use classes instead.
[17:46:11] <robertmaxrees> if you absoltuely can't, use .filter() if possible.  sizzle can get a little weird.
[17:47:23] <MACscr> well a class wouldnt make sense for a specific target as a class is typically used more than once on a page. now an ID would make sense, but thats not available in this situation.
[17:47:27] <marxe> line 27 : https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/7/
[17:47:41] <robertmaxrees> MACscr huh?  what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> marxe do you understand the idea behind what i'm suggesting?
[17:48:09] <MACscr> exactly whats on the fiddle. i need to change the price listed between the spam tags
[17:48:11] <MACscr> span
[17:48:13] <marxe> no :'(
[17:48:26] <arc_> a class doesn't have to be used more than once on a page
[17:48:27] <robertmaxrees> MACscr why do this client side, if you don't mind my asking?
[17:48:43] <robertmaxrees> marxe you want to add/remove a class that'll only have impact at a certain screen size.
[17:49:00] <MACscr> because im doing something the store solution doesnt natively support?
[17:49:02] <robertmaxrees> marxe you want to hide/show that nav only at that small size.  so use media queries to control that.
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> MACscr can we have more context?  sorry, just trying to make sure we're giving you sound advice?
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:50:01] <MACscr> i appreciate it, but id rather just solve this particular small issue so i can move on to my next issue
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> erm, then we can't really answer your question :(
[17:50:39] <MACscr> why not? do you really not understand what i am trying to do based on my fiddle?
[17:50:56] <MACscr> i have simplified it as much as possible
[17:50:59] <robertmaxrees> i understand you're trying to replace some text, but whenever i see something selection on data attributes, it's code smell.
[17:51:08] <robertmaxrees> if you absolutely HAVE to do that, then I'd suggest using .filter()
[17:51:28] <MACscr> have you not worked with third party code? its almost always going to smell
[17:51:37] <robertmaxrees> i have, actually.  plenty of times.
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> but using attribute selectors is usually a painful idea, hence my suggestion to use .filter()
[17:52:38] <robertmaxrees> the issue is data attribute values can be changed out from under you but not be reflected in the markup, and attribute selectors are hard to read.
[17:53:18] <MACscr> how is data-ttitle="foo" harder to read than class="bar"?
[17:53:30] <robertmaxrees> it's the square brackets and stuff around it.
[17:53:36] <robertmaxrees> ang that doesnt' change my other point :)
[17:54:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5r40r5v7/1/ i'd go for something like this just to be safe.
[17:54:47] <jqueryUser> anyone know how to setup global variables in greasemonkey?
[17:55:00] <taplar> define 'global'
[17:55:30] <jqueryUser> being able to access variables from with in multiple functions without having to pass them.
[17:55:48] <taplar> so just a global variable
[17:56:00] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser declare them before and outside of your other functions.
[17:56:10] <robertmaxrees> var myVar = 'foo'; // the rest of your code here.
[17:56:31] <jqueryUser> Like before $(document).ready(function() {
[17:56:31] <marxe> https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/10/
[17:56:33] <jqueryUser> ??
[17:56:46] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser is all of your other code inside of that document ready?
[17:56:57] <jqueryUser> yeah
[17:57:03] <robertmaxrees> then at the top of the doc ready.
[17:57:09] <robertmaxrees> don't pollute the global namespace ifyou can avoid it.
[17:57:35] <taplar> probably could just use an IIFE.  greasemonkey scripts run after the page loads
[17:57:50] <robertmaxrees> taplar he's already inside of a document ready so no need :)
[17:57:54] <robertmaxrees> already have a scope to work with.
[17:58:05] <taplar> yeah i was just thinking avoid the ready
[17:58:16] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah for a bigger refactor, sure.
[17:59:16] <jhoffmcd> Is it worth assigning jQuery objects to null when they are no longer needed?
[17:59:23] <robertmaxrees> jhoffmcd what do you mean?
[17:59:32] <robertmaxrees> by "jquery objects" i mean.
[17:59:52] <taplar> once they go out of scope they'll be cleaned up
[18:00:01] <taplar> if there isn't a reference to them
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:00:06] <jhoffmcd> If you cache $('.somenode') by assigning it to a var, then are done with it at some point
[18:00:22] <robertmaxrees> most js engines use reference counting.  no reason to treat jquery objects different than any others.
[18:00:37] <robertmaxrees> if you're seeing perf issues, it's usually not memory because of holding onto objects.
[18:00:44] <jhoffmcd> ok good to konw
[18:00:45] <robertmaxrees> or at least, not in most scenarios.
[18:01:04] <jhoffmcd> what if you want to make sure that object is never used again?
[18:01:11] <taplar> huh?
[18:01:18] <taplar> it's in the dom...
[18:01:26] <jhoffmcd> the reference to it
[18:01:32] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:01:35] <jqueryUser> Still no luck with the global variable. Google says something about unsafewindow
[18:01:44] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser show us your code.
[18:01:54] <jhoffmcd> Not sure why, just wondering how jQuery does its thin
[18:02:02] <robertmaxrees> jhoffmcd it's javascript.
[18:02:04] <taplar> jquery is javascript dude
[18:02:06] <robertmaxrees> so it's not doing anything differently.
[18:02:35] <jhoffmcd> sure, i get that, just want to make sure I'm not abusing it
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> just write javascript :)
[18:02:58] <robertmaxrees> you won't have any issues at that point.
[18:03:07] <taplar> so long as your not seeing performance issues, and it's readable and understandable, abuse the f out of it
[18:03:16] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:03:16] <jhoffmcd> lol, alright
[18:03:30] <jhoffmcd> well no performance issues yet
[18:03:34] <robertmaxrees> you usually run into more issues when you're trying to outsmart the engine.
[18:04:41] <jhoffmcd> I read an article that mentioned performance and setting jquery objects to null
[18:04:48] <jhoffmcd> so i was curious is that was an actual thing
[18:04:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[18:07:38] <jqueryUser> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/dL48zdZq
[18:08:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> GM_addStyle('.iso { \
[18:09:31] <robertmaxrees> that's throwing errors in my linter
[18:10:20] <robertmaxrees> also createNewQuestion(eval(objPass).onPass, ['Pass', 'Fail']); is a little funky.
[18:10:21] <jqueryUser> That's probably cause i didn't put the // @grant       GM_addStyle at the top in paste
[18:10:33] <jqueryUser> yeah the code is so big i cut out a lot of it
[18:10:51] <robertmaxrees> so you want to avoid eval as much as possible.  i wonder if that's part of the problem.
[18:12:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd maybe check in a greasemonkey channel as see what they have to say.
[18:13:21] <jqueryUser> robertmaxrees I think i found the fix. I just put it above the document.ready and it works in the functions
[18:13:39] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:16:10] <jqueryUser> nevermind it also works right after document.ready I didn't test that when you told me to do it before.
[18:16:24] <robertmaxrees> hah okay.  i thought i was losing my mind for a second.
[18:17:37] <jqueryUser> lol sorry. Thanks for the help.
[18:17:41] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :D
[18:24:23] <marxe> https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/10/ what do i do ?
[18:28:12] <marxe> robertmaxrees
[18:28:12] <marxe> robertmaxrees can you show me the solution ? :)
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> marxe i'll help you figure it out.
[18:28:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you think the problem is?
[18:28:39] <robertmaxrees> btw: there's no such thing as display: show;
[18:28:42] <robertmaxrees> you want display: block;
[18:29:06] <marxe> yes right
[18:29:06] <robertmaxrees> also, that .navbar-list { has a display: none; on it already.  you don't need to use that hide calss.
[18:30:23] <marxe> if I removed it appears
[18:31:23] <robertmaxrees> kill the hide class.
[18:31:29] <robertmaxrees> you just want to add/remove the show calss.
[18:32:27] <robertmaxrees> and your js is still weird.
[18:32:44] <robertmaxrees> just check if you have a show class.  if net, add it.  if you do, remove it.
[18:32:47] <robertmaxrees> simple stuff.
[18:37:37] <marxe> https://jsfiddle.net/zerzerrez/okL9xjp1/14/
[18:38:48] <robertmaxrees> you know the order of your css matters, yeah?
[18:39:41] <robjloranger> i need some pointers trying to run a series of animations. currently my code fires all at once not waiting for the previous to finish. http://pastebin.com/taZ4shwy
[18:39:43] <drej> that whole C of CSS is complicated
[18:39:50] <robertmaxrees> drej :)
[18:40:07] <robjloranger> is there a jquery/jquery ui animation lesson/tutorial?
[18:40:21] <taplar> i don't see.... an animation
[18:40:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:40:37] <robjloranger> lol, maybe that's my issue
[18:40:53] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/effects/custom-effects/
[18:40:57] <taplar> i also don't see a duration as being an optional parameter for toggleClass
[18:41:11] <robertmaxrees> also, the docs for .animate() are super helpful.  you want the success callback.
[18:41:19] * taplar hugs the docs
[18:41:33] <robjloranger> i was using toggle class because my colors are in hsla and i just want to 'pulse' them brighter. toggleClass has optional parameters in jquery ui
[18:41:45] <taplar> humm
[18:41:49] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs, either way.
[18:41:52] <robertmaxrees> you want the callback.
[18:42:14] <marxe> I have to change what?
[18:42:30] <robertmaxrees> marxe you need to move your show class and put it below the other one.
[18:42:40] <robjloranger> ok, thanks robertmaxrees
[18:42:50] <robertmaxrees> marxe .navbar-list { put it after these styles.
[18:49:11] <marxe> robertmaxrees thank you for your patience and your explanation, i'm beginner but it works :)
[18:49:33] <robertmaxrees> marxe you should check out learn.jquery.com and also look up some css tutorials.  they'd really help you.
[18:55:51] <arc_> robertmaxrees may i pm you
[18:56:02] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[19:42:59] <jqueryUser> Instead of using eval what's another option?
[19:43:13] <taplar> to do what?
[19:44:12] <jqueryUser> I have this right now. eval(buttonId).onPass
[19:44:26] <jqueryUser> buttonId is the ID of an element
[19:44:36] <jqueryUser> .onPass is part of an object
[19:45:14] <taplar> you can lookup by id with $('#theid')
[19:45:22] <Mark____> can anyone take a look at this and tell me what it does? https://jsfiddle.net/cvgz85kt/
[19:47:42] <taplar> Mark____: what part are you asking about?
[19:48:05] <robertmaxrees> Mark____ it sets a lot of css based on screen width and height.
[19:48:06] <Mark____> i realize it gives those layers width value and height value
[19:48:18] <taplar> all of that could be done with pure css fwiw
[19:48:28] <robertmaxrees> usually that's compensating for bad css.
[19:48:36] <Mark____> but what’s the difference between that and just css height and widths?
[19:48:46] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser you know you can lookup properties using strings, right?
[19:48:46] <Mark____> yea
[19:49:12] <jqueryUser> so buttonId.onPass would work?
[19:49:26] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser i'd have to see the code in question.
[19:49:27] <jqueryUser> var buttonId = $(this).parent().data('id');
[19:49:40] <robertmaxrees> what's a sample value?
[19:51:04] <taplar> Mark____: if your going to keep that logic, for whatever reason, cache your lookups outside of your resize binding
[19:51:38] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser ?
[19:52:49] <jqueryUser> q1 is what value
[19:53:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that.
[19:53:27] <robertmaxrees> create an object - myVar = {q1: 'whatever stuff here', q2: 'etc' }
[19:53:37] <robertmaxrees> then read those props using strings.
[19:53:43] <robertmaxrees> myVar[myString]
[19:53:44] <jqueryUser> var q1 = {question:"Test PSU", onPass:"q3", onFail:"q2"};
[19:53:48] <jqueryUser> that's my object
[19:53:58] <robertmaxrees> right, you want q1 as apart of a bigger object.
[19:54:19] <robertmaxrees> var myQuestions = {q1: {question:"Test PSU", onPass:"q3", onFail:"q2"}, q2: {}} etc
[19:54:27] <jqueryUser> oh i see what your saying
[19:55:06] <jqueryUser> how does that work in the code? myQuestions.q1.question?
[19:55:33] <robertmaxrees> if you were using normal JS, yes, but you want to use a string, so it'd by myQuestions[myVar].question
[19:55:54] <jqueryUser> that is pretty awesome. Let me give that a shot
[19:58:17] <jqueryUser> TypeError: myQuestions[q1] is undefined
[19:58:33] <robertmaxrees> what's your variable named?
[19:58:53] <taplar> object.propName === object['propName']
[19:59:06] <robertmaxrees> you want your buttonId var there instead.
[19:59:23] <jqueryUser> var myQuestions = {q1:{question:"Test PSU", onPass:"q3", onFail:"q2"},	q2:{question:"Remove PSU", onPass:"end", onFail:"end"}};
[19:59:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:59:36] <robertmaxrees> so you're using a variable in the []
[19:59:39] <robertmaxrees> not the value.
[20:00:39] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser so you have var buttonId = $(this).parent().data('id');, right?
[20:00:46] <jqueryUser> right
[20:00:54] <robertmaxrees> so you want to use buttonId there.
[20:00:56] <robertmaxrees> not q1
[20:03:05] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm building an iPhone app that rotates a 3d model. I need a JS library where I can pinpoint and label different areas of the model. Where the "pointer" moves as the model rotates. Hope that makes sense.
[20:03:41] <robertmaxrees> checkit tall order - how are you showing the 3d model?
[20:03:45] <robertmaxrees> sometimes tells me it'd need to hook into that.
[20:04:03] <robertmaxrees> *something
[20:04:43] <jqueryUser> Found the issue. myQuestions['q1'].question It needed ''
[20:04:51] <robertmaxrees> jqueryUser right.
[20:04:57] <robertmaxrees> but you're not using the string.
[20:05:00] <robertmaxrees> you're using a var there.
[20:05:13] <jqueryUser> yeah i was just using it as testing
[20:05:25] <robertmaxrees> lol welp
[20:07:14] <checkit> robertmaxrees: these screencaps might help: http://imgur.com/a/D0PaP
[20:07:28] <robertmaxrees> i really don't like screencaps.
[20:07:32] <robertmaxrees> either way, i know what yoiu want.
[20:07:40] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing really jquery-related that can help :/
[20:08:51] <checkit> robertmaxrees: I don't either but... But thank you for looking.
[20:09:02] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in a place like ##javascript.
[20:09:17] <robertmaxrees> or a channel dedicated to whatever you're using for viewing the 3d stuff.,
[20:11:06] <graphettion> Do you think this is a good implementation of searching? Tags and search? - https://safetyskills.com/courses
[20:11:31] <robertmaxrees> honestly?  no.
[20:11:43] <graphettion> That's what I thought.
[20:11:52] <robertmaxrees> one input.  no tags or anything.
[20:11:59] <graphettion> Can you tell me why though?
[20:12:06] <graphettion> Trying to figure out a good explanation.
[20:12:09] <robertmaxrees> you're asking the user to categorize and do half your job.
[20:12:31] <graphettion> The argument the developers have is - under oil and gas - then I can search management.
[20:12:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:12:49] <graphettion> Like if you pick the Oil and Gas tag
[20:12:55] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason i'm searching is because i don't know/don't care about your taxonomy.
[20:12:56] <graphettion> then you can search for management on that page
[20:13:08] <robertmaxrees> if I knew/cared, i'd naviga tethere instead
[20:13:22] <graphettion> So do you think just having a search is good?
[20:13:46] <robertmaxrees> having good search is good.
[20:13:56] <taplar> personally, the dual search inputs is weird
[20:14:02] <graphettion> I'm trying to persuade the devs to remove it.
[20:14:08] <graphettion> I agree.
[20:14:12] <graphettion> It's conflicting too when you code it.
[20:14:15] <taplar> my first question is "which one do i use?"
[20:14:38] <graphettion> But that's another thing. The input gives you some terms to go off of.
[20:14:45] <graphettion> But I don't think that matters either.
[20:14:52] <taplar> what's the difference between searching and browsing?
[20:14:55] <graphettion> People are going to search for whatever they want anyway.
[20:15:26] <graphettion> specifically looking for something vs viewing a catalog
[20:15:30] <graphettion> *shrugs*
[20:15:48] <taplar> seems like the browsing would be more like a menu listing
[20:17:07] <graphettion> good point taplar
[20:17:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need solid taxonomy and then a solid search setup with good synonyms.
[20:17:24] <robertmaxrees> (my company does a decent job at the search side)
[20:17:29] <robertmaxrees> also, faceting if it's not overkill.
[20:17:37] <graphettion> I think this would be good
[20:17:37] <graphettion> http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/wfaGu
[20:17:44] <graphettion> It searches for all text terms
[20:17:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:17:48] <graphettion> not just the title
[20:17:58] <robertmaxrees> don't use isotope for something like this.
[20:18:06] <graphettion> What should I use?
[20:18:11] <robertmaxrees> you need a robust backend.
[20:18:17] <robertmaxrees> SOLR or something like that, depending.
[20:18:29] <robertmaxrees> but don't load all your course data into the client machine.
[20:18:36] <taplar> ^
[20:18:49] <robertmaxrees> hence avoiding isotope.
[20:18:53] <graphettion> it's loading it via KnockoutJS
[20:18:58] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[20:19:04] <robertmaxrees> you're still filtering all that data client-site
[20:19:06] <robertmaxrees> *side
[20:19:11] <robertmaxrees> how many courses total are there?
[20:19:23] <graphettion> No idea, but a lot.
[20:19:32] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want to do that at all.
[20:19:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll quickly hit a wall there.
[20:19:51] <graphettion> yeah, we talked about just having 20 on the page
[20:19:56] <graphettion> and stuff
[20:20:00] <robertmaxrees> so a user can only search 20 total courses?
[20:20:13] <graphettion> no, when they search for something else it loads
[20:20:17] <graphettion> I dunno.
[20:20:23] <robertmaxrees> lol don't do that.
[20:20:26] <graphettion> lol
[20:20:35] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating that part.
[20:21:20] <taplar> I could see something like.  Initial landing page.  "We offer courses in..."  and list the categories that they could choose to view.  Click on one and it shows them.  Along with the additional search ability
[20:21:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm seeing something really similar to an ecommerce solution.
[20:22:18] <robertmaxrees> basic top navigation grouped by department, subnavs focused appropriately.
[20:22:18] <graphettion> So it should all be done in ASP.NET?
[20:22:29] <graphettion> (what we use)
[20:22:30] <robertmaxrees> or whatever server-side you've got, sure.
[20:22:38] <robertmaxrees> frontend could do some ajax-y goodness.
[20:23:08] <graphettion> yeah, there's a lot of work that needs done on that page.
[20:23:18] <graphettion> Right now, I'm just focusing on making it filter properly.
[20:23:29] <graphettion> May just need to strip the page and start from scratch.
[20:23:32] <robertmaxrees> except you're using isotope which is exactly waht you don't want to do.
[20:23:41] <graphettion> Yeah.
[20:23:41] <robertmaxrees> since you have a ton of data you're working with.
[20:23:45] <taplar> who are you building this for?
[20:24:02] <graphettion> I work at SafetySkills. I just got hired recently.
[20:24:10] <taplar> I mean, who are your end users?
[20:24:11] <graphettion> And overwhelmed with all this code.
[20:24:19] <graphettion> Mostly public sector.
[20:24:46] <graphettion> We create courseware like How to Maintain an Airplane
[20:24:47] <graphettion> FAA
[20:24:48] <taplar> Has there been any sort of discussions about the needs your trying to meet?
[20:24:50] <graphettion> would want that
[20:25:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, this sounds like a product catalog.
[20:25:13] <taplar> pretty much
[20:25:16] <graphettion> Vaguely.
[20:25:21] <robertmaxrees> lol not vaguely.
[20:25:24] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[20:25:24] <taplar> you have things, and your selling things
[20:25:33] <robertmaxrees> your products are courses instead of material goods.
[20:25:45] <graphettion> Yeah, we have an LMS (keeps track of students scores, reports, etc)
[20:25:51] <robertmaxrees> i know what an LMS is.
[20:25:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:25:59] <robertmaxrees> learning management system :)
[20:26:01] <graphettion> Sorry, I'm used to ppl who don't.
[20:26:09] <taplar> <---
[20:26:12] <robertmaxrees> i grew up in the academic world.
[20:26:28] <graphettion> Many ppl don't. At least from my experience.
[20:26:30] <robertmaxrees> either way, you should be looking at amazon, ebay, etc. for examples.
[20:26:51] <robertmaxrees> my company's site gets some praise for our search system even though it needs a LOT of love.
[20:27:15] <graphettion> Eh, I would just be happy if it functioned.
[20:27:25] <taplar> i like newegg's approach to categorization and searching
[20:27:36] <robertmaxrees> taplar yeah, it's a different skin on what everybody does.
[20:27:40] <graphettion> Yeah, they breadcrumb it.
[20:27:52] <robertmaxrees> you mean the left-hand side drilldown?
[20:27:58] <taplar> yeah
[20:28:03] <robertmaxrees> those are called "Facets"
[20:28:07] <robertmaxrees> they do faceted search.
[20:28:07] <graphettion> Yeah, that's a good feature.
[20:28:12] <taplar> which explode into the models with multiple links
[20:28:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah they have to do that because of compatibility
[20:28:56] <robertmaxrees> http://www.build.com/index.cfm?page=search%3Abrowse&term=chrome+kitchen+faucet this is what we do.
[20:28:57] <taplar> we're doing more of that on our site.  actually the project i'm on now is dealing with loading faceted serach data
[20:29:09] <graphettion> So basically the answer I am getting is just do a back-end search for courses.
[20:29:14] <robertmaxrees> graphettion yep.
[20:29:16] <graphettion> kk
[20:29:20] <robertmaxrees> you can enhance that later with ajaxy goodness.
[20:29:20] <graphettion> Thanks guys!
[20:29:32] <robertmaxrees> but your company is probably losing free money right now.
[20:29:49] <graphettion> Loosing free money?
[20:30:06] <robertmaxrees> having a good search interface often means more customers.
[20:30:15] <robertmaxrees> they want to buy from you - gotta help them get what they want :)
[20:30:46] <taplar> http://www.dillards.com/c/shoes-women-shoes
[20:31:02] <robertmaxrees> dillards does pretty well.  lots of clothing stored to.
[20:31:06] <robertmaxrees> *stores do
[20:31:08] <graphettion> Yeah, that's why they are hiring. To gather the market requirements to get that in palce.
[20:31:12] <graphettion> place*
[20:31:39] <taplar> it's been our big focus for the past few years really
[20:31:40] <robertmaxrees> graphettion :) y'all should look to ecom for inspiration.
[20:31:42] <graphettion> I just started so I'm trying to analyze all this.
[20:31:47] <robertmaxrees> taplar do you work for dillards?
[20:31:50] <taplar> yeah
[20:31:54] <graphettion> cool
[20:31:56] <robertmaxrees> hah
[20:32:05] <taplar> not on the ecom team, but yeah
[20:32:18] <robertmaxrees> that's awesome.
[20:32:24] <robertmaxrees> how long have you been there?>
[20:32:30] <taplar> 8 years
[20:32:39] <graphettion> robertmaxrees: Would it be bad to use ASP.NET and knockout or just ASP.NET?
[20:33:02] <robertmaxrees> graphettion do you understand what role knockout plays there?
[20:33:20] <graphettion> Gets data model info and brings it to the view.
[20:33:30] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.
[20:33:39] <robertmaxrees> honestly, i'd suggest starting with just the asp.net side of things.
[20:33:41] <robertmaxrees> enhance it later.
[20:33:45] <graphettion> kk
[20:33:53] <robertmaxrees> if you need ajaxy goodness, make it more complicated ;)
[20:34:07] <graphettion> Sorry, I just feel very overwhelmed with this.
[20:34:13] <robertmaxrees> taplar wow.  that's how long i was at my last company.
[20:34:16] <graphettion> It's a big project for just stepping into it.
[20:34:39] <robertmaxrees> graphettion nah, no need. you're figuring it out. focus on an MVP.
[20:34:40] <graphettion> grats taplar
[20:34:51] <taplar> i'll keep going until they kick me out, heh
[20:34:56] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:35:09] <robertmaxrees> i worked for a company that did print conversion for dillard's newspaper ads.
[20:35:15] <robertmaxrees> among other things.
[20:35:19] <robertmaxrees> dark days.
[20:35:28] <graphettion> of DOS!
[20:35:33] <taplar> interesting.  was it based in AR?
[20:35:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:35:45] <robertmaxrees> northern california.  we worked with the newspapers.
[20:35:51] <taplar> ah
[20:36:30] <robertmaxrees> brb
[20:38:44] <taplar> graphettion: side note, in regards to your site.  have you considered making the nav selection a sticky?
[20:39:29] <graphettion> Yeah, I know a lot about html, css, and sass. More web design related stuff.
[20:39:35] <graphettion> But I'm fairly new.
[20:39:42] <graphettion> So working with what they have right now.
[20:39:46] <taplar> :)
[20:39:53] <graphettion> But we are prolly going to use bootstrap.
[20:40:00] <robertmaxrees> back
[20:40:07] <graphettion> navbar-fixed-top
[20:40:31] <taplar> does that do the auto sticky once you scroll down past it?
[20:40:35] <graphettion> I'm good at landing pages, but less good at programming this crap.
[20:40:45] <robertmaxrees> "crap"?
[20:41:10] * taplar thinks he sounds like a UXer
[20:41:36] <graphettion> Pretty much.
[20:42:10] <graphettion> I want to learn to program well.
[20:42:31] <robertmaxrees> then stop thinking of it as "crap" :)
[20:42:47] <graphettion> I didn't mean programming as crap.
[20:42:51] <graphettion> I meant the site.
[20:42:53] <graphettion> As crap.
[20:42:54] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[20:42:59] <robertmaxrees> don't think of it that way :)
[20:43:16] <taplar> think of it as your gateway to showing them how awesome you are
[20:43:20] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[20:43:22] <graphettion> Do I think of it as one of Thomas Edison's lightbulb?
[20:43:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:43:32] <robertmaxrees> even though the first version of that sucked.
[20:43:37] <graphettion> lol
[20:43:49] <robertmaxrees> let's put it this way: we have an internal tool that we think is fucking terrible in every way imaginable.
[20:43:55] <robertmaxrees> it's a nightmare for devs and our end users.
[20:44:19] <robertmaxrees> but any time somebody that has experience with similar systems comes in and sees ours, they think it's amazing.
[20:44:26] <taplar> lol
[20:44:32] <graphettion> So, in other words, build the site to where you want to be represented.
[20:44:41] <graphettion> And successful.
[20:44:43] <robertmaxrees> build the best thing you can.
[20:44:53] <robertmaxrees> even if it's not the best, do what you can to make it better
[20:45:02] <graphettion> yeah
[20:45:09] <taplar> and encourage others to do the same
[20:45:14] <graphettion> I really am trying. I just get frustrated.
[20:45:15] <robertmaxrees> hell, our legacy systems are in coldfusion.  even then, there are some things we're really proud of with that platform.
[20:45:24] <graphettion> And sometime's wonder if I can even do this.
[20:45:32] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[20:45:33] <taplar> one day at a time
[20:45:36] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[20:45:41] <robertmaxrees> and you'll always be learning.
[20:45:43] <robertmaxrees> I'm still learning.
[20:45:53] <graphettion> Ewww. Coldfusion.
[20:45:57] <graphettion> Glad I'm not doing that.
[20:46:06] <robertmaxrees> hell, half of what makes me a good sr. dev is knowing that i don't know very muchf.
[20:46:25] <robertmaxrees> and modern cf is better, but it's still cf.  we've done some great stuff with it, but we're moving on.
[20:47:19] <graphettion> That's cool. Learning multiple languages even though some may not be the best is still pretty damn awesome.
[20:47:29] <robertmaxrees> it's actually a lot easier than you'd think.
[20:47:44] <taplar> the more languages you see and things you encounter, the more patterns your exposed to
[20:47:48] <robertmaxrees> I've worked with .net (asp and c#), python, cf, lots of js...
[20:48:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar is right.  and you'll begin to notice the similarities.
[20:48:07] <graphettion> Oh, I know some.
[20:48:13] <graphettion> polymorphism
[20:48:17] <graphettion> constructors
[20:48:18] <graphettion> blah
[20:48:20] <taplar> beyond that
[20:48:24] <taplar> solution patterns
[20:48:28] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[20:48:38] <graphettion> Like Entity Framework and ActiveRecord
[20:48:41] <graphettion> similaries?
[20:48:46] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[20:48:47] <taplar> no, like
[20:48:50] <taplar> think about your site
[20:49:03] <taplar> and how robert started talking about other solutions
[20:49:09] <taplar> he's seen those patterns
[20:49:10] <robertmaxrees> more like common design patterns for problems.  how you might abstract things out.
[20:49:25] <robertmaxrees> it's all about understanding your real problem.
[20:49:37] <graphettion> I see what you mean.
[20:49:42] <graphettion> What's the purpose of the page.
[20:49:50] <graphettion> You could quickly determine that.
[20:49:59] <robertmaxrees> how could i make it better.
[20:50:02] <graphettion> Based on your experience.
[20:50:04] <graphettion> yeah
[20:50:06] <taplar> hey, this thing is like this other thing.  which has been figured out and working well for years
[20:50:19] <taplar> might be something to try, :)
[20:50:23] <robertmaxrees> it's how we know when to which which library/framework/
[20:51:02] <graphettion> I very dedicated to doing it. I just get frustrated sometimes because something is not working and I spend 3 days on it. And it's just AHHH!!!
[20:51:08] <graphettion> But I am persistent.
[20:51:12] <taplar> phsss, 3 days
[20:51:16] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha 3 days.
[20:51:25] <robertmaxrees> you see that search thing i tossed out?
[20:51:33] <fas3r> Hello
[20:51:37] <graphettion> What search thing?
[20:51:39] <taplar> bonjour
[20:51:46] <robertmaxrees> the build.com search page i linked earlier?
[20:51:54] <graphettion> oh, my bad, didn't catch it
[20:52:00] <fas3r> how to set the value of a <var></<var> element with jquery ?
[20:52:03] <graphettion> or may forgot
[20:52:07] <robertmaxrees> fas3r there's no var element.
[20:52:08] <graphettion> What about it?
[20:52:11] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean xml.
[20:52:32] <robertmaxrees> graphettion 6 weeks to build that.  the JS is bad, the CF is bad.  the styles are bad.
[20:52:36] <robertmaxrees> 6 looong weeks.
[20:52:53] <graphettion> What was you thinking the whole time?
[20:52:55] <taplar> good search is hard, especially when you have to integrate with other systems, most legacy
[20:52:59] <robertmaxrees> "it'll get done"
[20:53:19] <taplar> the important thing is to realize that your doing your job
[20:53:21] <robertmaxrees> taplar i had to hook it to our new backend, which was working with our new solr setup.
[20:53:21] <graphettion> So it's a search app for home improvement
[20:53:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:53:24] <fas3r> robertmaxrees:  it must be one :D https://addtocalendar.com/ ( check the example to the bottom )
[20:53:25] <graphettion> neat
[20:53:25] <taplar> and your superiors know that
[20:53:35] <robertmaxrees> graphettion they hired you because they have confidence.
[20:53:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise they wouldn't have
[20:53:47] <robertmaxrees> fas3r ?
[20:54:14] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/var aaah.
[20:54:16] <robertmaxrees> try .text()?
[20:54:27] <graphettion> Time to learn some ASP.NET.
[20:54:29] <graphettion> lol
[20:54:33] <taplar> just go in there each day with an attitude that your doing to do the best you can.
[20:54:50] <robertmaxrees> you won't get it perfect.  you're rarely get it right on the first try.  but you'll learn.
[20:55:05] <taplar> i make it a point that my superiors know i'm a "what do you need me to do?" guy
[20:55:23] <robertmaxrees> even better - just BE that guy.
[20:55:29] <robertmaxrees> jump on chances to try shit.
[20:55:33] <taplar> :)
[20:55:35] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: I tried .val and .text no luck
[20:55:42] <graphettion> yeah
[20:56:22] <taplar> i've switched teams a couple times now, not because I didn't like my old team, but there was a need.
[20:56:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y23L3qmu/
[20:56:25] <taplar> feel the need!
[20:56:27] <robertmaxrees> fas3r works fine.
[20:56:29] <taplar> fill
[20:56:33] <taplar> lmao
[20:56:42] <robertmaxrees> hahaha my manager refuses to let me move to another team.
[20:56:49] <robertmaxrees> the only thing he wants is for me to get promoted to team lead.
[20:56:57] <taplar> nice
[20:57:05] <graphettion> That's a good problem to have!
[20:57:08] <robertmaxrees> very.
[20:57:20] <robertmaxrees> we have a kickass group here.
[20:57:33] <taplar> we're mixed in we have some traditional teams like that, but we have other agile teams with tech leads
[20:58:00] <robertmaxrees> we do a hybrid agile, but teams stay static and focused on particular areas.
[20:58:05] <graphettion> I hope to be as awesome as you guys. You give programming a good name.
[20:58:14] <taplar> lies!
[20:58:17] <robertmaxrees> slander!
[20:58:18] <graphettion> lol
[20:58:24] <graphettion> libel!
[20:58:30] <robertmaxrees> ninjas!
[20:58:30] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[20:58:36] <taplar> lol
[20:58:43] <graphettion> :P
[20:59:01] <graphettion> Aiight, 'nuff talk. Time to learn.
[21:04:06] <robertmaxrees> i just want to play guitar right now.
[21:04:25] <taplar> i'm trying to figure out my crapy ux, :|
[21:04:38] <robertmaxrees> just do what I do.
[21:04:40] <robertmaxrees> drink.
[21:04:44] <robertmaxrees> wait - that's terrible advice.
[21:05:09] <taplar> i gave that advice to a guy who didn't come to work today due to being sick
[21:05:23] <robertmaxrees> party time!
[21:05:35] <danielyaa5_> Im trying to get my views to be resizable but am getting weird behavior, can anyone help me out? https://jsfiddle.net/danielyaa5/74g987qn/32/
[21:06:06] <taplar> what's werid?
[21:06:10] <taplar> or weird even
[21:06:21] * taplar gives up
[21:07:14] <danielyaa5_> like if I expand width of V1 the border dissappears around v2. Or if I change height of v1 it only slightly effects height of V3.
[21:07:15] <taplar> one thing you have quite a few lookups in your callback
[21:07:40] <taplar> woah
[21:07:43] <taplar> dude
[21:07:53] <taplar> your binding your resizable in the resize handler?
[21:08:01] <robertmaxrees> yodawg.
[21:08:31] <taplar> surely resizable has options to change parameters after the fact
[21:08:57] <ShadeS> ok so I am doing  var section = $('<section></section>'); then i am doing $(header).after(section); then I am doing $(section).addClass('row first'); i have a while loop that dynamically adds stuff, THEN I have $('.row.first').after(section); but this last *.after(section) is not being added, any idea why? It seems taht if I type in $('.row.first').after('<section></section>') works, but I'd like to reuse variables if I can because DRY
[21:09:05] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[21:09:08] <robertmaxrees> hey ShadeS make a fiddle.
[21:09:16] <ShadeS> I think/suspect it has something to do with this .addClass
[21:10:05] <danielyaa5_> robertmaxtrees: ill look for an option. but have you ever added resizable to a flexbox? Can you tell me anything about resizable that may help me?
[21:10:08] <ShadeS> robertmaxrees: jsfiddle doesn't like it when i paste my .html contents into it
[21:10:24] <robertmaxrees> ShadeS try anyway?
[21:10:30] <robertmaxrees> it's easier to see at the very least.
[21:10:45] <taplar> $('.row.first').after(section);
[21:10:53] <ShadeS> ok
[21:10:54] <robertmaxrees> danielyaa5_ err.  taplar was heping you fwiw.
[21:10:54] <taplar> i thought you added those classes -to- section
[21:10:55] <ShadeS> https://jsfiddle.net/930quu7j/
[21:11:07] <robertmaxrees> ShadeS oh lol that's not how you use jsfiddle
[21:11:08] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[21:11:24] <danielyaa5_> robertmaxrees: whoops.
[21:11:36] <robertmaxrees> ShadeS https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/930quu7j/1/
[21:11:40] <danielyaa5_> taplar: Can you help me out?
[21:11:44] <ShadeS> if I take line 30 and turn it into $('.row.first).after(section) it doesn't do the behavior I"m expecting/hoping for
[21:11:52] <robertmaxrees> ShadeS what's streams about?
[21:12:49] <ShadeS> it just generates some random tweets
[21:12:50] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're loading some stuff and then appending it?
[21:13:01] <taplar> danielyaa5_: so as I said I see two issues with this.  first you are doing dom lookups in a resize event handler.  those can/will fire -a lot- so you'll most likely see a performance issue from that
[21:13:22] <ShadeS> this js fiddle is actually making this much harder to read
[21:13:31] <taplar> danielyaa5_: the second issue is that your reinitializing your resizables AND rebinding to them on every resize event
[21:13:36] <robertmaxrees> that's not your issue here actually.
[21:13:40] <robertmaxrees> ShadeS you need a templating engine.
[21:13:45] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't want a while loop there.
[21:14:02] <ShadeS> robertmaxrees: that's the 'skeleton framework' i'm told to work off of
[21:14:08] <robertmaxrees> wat
[21:14:10] <robertmaxrees> really?
[21:14:15] <ShadeS> yes really
[21:14:20] <robertmaxrees> they're making you use jquery as a frontend templating engine?
[21:14:34] <ShadeS> i dont' know what you mean by frontend templating engine
[21:14:59] <robertmaxrees> something like dust or underscore's templating.
[21:15:15] <danielyaa5_> taplar: ok thanks I'll look into that
[21:15:24] <robertmaxrees> makes this sort of stuff easie.
[21:15:40] <ShadeS> there are four things I need to do, show user new tewets some how, display timestamps of tweets, design your interface so you want to look at and use the procut you're making (the step i'm on), and allow a user to click on a username to get a timeline
[21:15:47] <robertmaxrees> either way, while loops don't have scope, so you should check out using forEach instead.
[21:16:06] <taplar> danielyaa5_: also take a look at this: http://api.jqueryui.com/resizable/#method-option
[21:16:25] <taplar> you should be able to change your options with that, so you don't have to reinitialize over and over
[21:16:41] <ShadeS> robertmaxrees: yes, the program stresses functional programming very much but in this particular assignment it is what it is
[21:17:15] <taplar> also this: windowHeight * (.83)
[21:17:18] <robertmaxrees> ShadeS this isn't about being functional - you've got var declarations that aren't doing what you think they are.
[21:17:28] <taplar> that could be 83vh instead
[21:17:36] <taplar> no need to do the math or change it
[21:17:51] <robertmaxrees> just trying to help you make this MUCH easier.
[21:18:20] <robertmaxrees> also, no need to do $(section).addClass('row first'); - section is already a jquery object.
[21:18:39] <ShadeS> var header = $('<header><h1><a href="index.html">Welcome to<br>Twittler!</a></h1></header>'); $body.prepend(header); $(header).addClass('primary-header container group'); var section = $('<section></section>'); $(header).after(section); $(section).addClass('row first'); $('.row.first').after(section)  <--- this last line doesn't add another <section></section> after the first <section></section> and I'm not sure why
[21:18:52] <danielyaa5_> taplar: So if I console log $( ".selector" ).resizable( "option" ) it will show me all the current settings?
[21:18:56] <robertmaxrees> hey so please stop sharing code in the channe.
[21:18:59] <robertmaxrees> it's super hard to read :)
[21:19:01] <ShadeS> robertmaxrees: oh well the vars inside of the loop weren't created by me, also the var $body.ready was part of the original document
[21:19:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[21:19:47] <robertmaxrees> you're moving that section tag around.
[21:19:53] <taplar> danielyaa5_: looks like that's the case
[21:20:21] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.
[21:20:22] <robertmaxrees> enjoy kids.
[21:22:00] <danielyaa5_>  #taplar: You were right about the resize, Im pretty sure its messing stuff up. Any idea why V1 gets bigger but won't get smaller? https://jsfiddle.net/danielyaa5/74g987qn/27/
[21:23:09] <taplar> it's stretching and shrinking for me..?  atleast vertically
[21:23:29] <taplar> and horizontal
[21:23:39] <taplar> said those backwards
[21:24:27] <danielyaa5_> taplar: Shrinks smaller than initial width?
[21:24:45] <taplar> yep
[21:25:28] <danielyaa5_> taplar: wth, it also jumps right the moment I start adjusting it.
[21:25:36] <ShadeS> ok
[21:25:48] <ShadeS> here is a bpaste that better highlights my issue: https://bpaste.net/show/bc9ef72ab0bb
[21:26:14] <ShadeS> I'd like to be able to $('.row.first').after(section) instead of having ot retype<section></section>
[21:30:21] <ShadeS> for some reason if I do $(header).after(section) it will add section, INITIALLY, but if i call $(header).after(section) again it won't add another one
[21:30:26] <ShadeS> i don't get this behavior at all
[21:31:24] <ShadeS> I thought I understood this 'after' business but apparently I don't, once I declare var section = $('<section></section>'), section seems to disappear afte rI add it once
[21:31:27] <ShadeS> what gives ??
[21:32:34] <ShadeS> this is really bizzard behavior
[21:33:13] <ShadeS> I can still console.log(section) after I declared it but I can't use it with .after() anymore
[21:33:17] <ShadeS> is this how it's supposed to work?
[21:36:24] <arc_> it could be a lot easier to figure out your issue if we could see your code
[21:40:32] <ngharo> ShadeS: you're doing this pretty much: var $something = $('.row.first'); $something.after($something);
[21:41:04] <ngharo> i dunno, that just seems like a weird behaviour
[21:46:26] <ShadeS> ngharo: i wanted to create a <section></section> after the header, which I am able to do just fine, then i add a class to this section, 'row first'; now I want to add another section after this first section
[21:48:08] <taplar> ShadeS: so what are you confused about?
[21:52:43] <ShadeS> if I do $(header).after(section) it will add a <section></section> after the </header>; if I do it again, it will not add additional <sections></section>'s after the header
[21:52:55] <taplar> right, it moves it
[21:53:05] <ShadeS> define 'it' in both cases please
[21:53:25] <taplar> jQueryObject.after(anotherJQueryObject);
[21:53:35] <taplar> that moves the first element after the second element
[21:53:51] <ShadeS> moves, not ADDs ?
[21:54:14] <taplar> the second element has to be in the dom already.  it optionally adds the first element if it's not already attached
[21:55:33] <taplar> if you want to create another one you'll either have to do it with a string, as your bpaste showed, or clone the element
[21:55:39] <ShadeS> so if (section) has /aready been added/ it will just move it arround and not actually ad it AGAIN?
[21:55:45] <taplar> right
[21:55:57] <ngharo> you can .clone() if you want to create a copy
[21:56:11] <taplar> your telling it put -this element- after -this other element-
[21:56:14] <taplar> not create anything
[21:56:42] <ShadeS> because if I do something like $('.row.first').after('<section></section>'); $('row.first').after('<section></section'); it will add TWO sections after the original one which has the row first class
[21:56:59] <taplar> because your giving it a string which jquery has to parse into and create an object
[21:57:07] <taplar> in that case it does not already have an object
[21:57:42] <ShadeS> ok i think that's starting to make a little more sense
[21:57:54] <ShadeS> weird way of doing things but ok I guess that's just 'how it is'
[21:58:05] <taplar> yup, your manipulating dom nodes, :)
[21:58:20] <taplar> if you want new ones, you have to tell it
[21:59:40] <ShadeS> so I think i can just fix this with .clone().after(section); ?
[21:59:53] <taplar> that would create a new one and append it to that section
[22:00:04] <taplar> err, after that section
[22:00:46] <ShadeS> that just ereased something
[22:01:01] <taplar> $('.row.first').after('<section></section>');
[22:01:10] <ShadeS> i'm hoping to reuse this section variable
[22:01:17] <taplar> your putting it after a brand new section that is not attached to the dom
[22:01:18] <ShadeS> so i don't have to retype <section></section>
[22:01:20] <taplar> so you'd lose it
[22:01:37] <taplar> so what's the goal here?
[22:01:48] <taplar> two sections, the first of which having the classes row and first?
[22:02:07] <ShadeS> yes i first create a header, i $body.prepend(header)
[22:02:19] <taplar> what classes should the second section have?
[22:02:24] <ShadeS> i then add classses to the header, then i create a section variable that's <section></section>
[22:02:40] <ShadeS> it will probably be row.second
[22:03:02] <taplar> mmm, that'll get a bid weird but ok
[22:03:05] <ShadeS> this clone isn't working like I thought
[22:03:05] <taplar> *bit
[22:03:22] <ShadeS> idk why it'd be weird, i'd like to have a header, section, section, on the page
[22:03:37] <taplar> i was talking about the .first, .second, ...
[22:03:52] <ShadeS> well i have to tag them so I can manipulate them accordingly
[22:04:09] <ShadeS> if there's no .first or .second then any changes to <section> will change all sections
[22:04:14] <taplar> why not just reference them by index or put a data-row on them?
[22:04:26] <ShadeS> because i don't know what i'm doing
[22:04:30] <taplar> k, one sec
[22:04:32] <ShadeS> and there's several ways to "do it wrong"
[22:04:38] <ShadeS> and only like a handful or one way of doing it 'correctly'
[22:04:55] <ShadeS> idk how to do front end stuff but i'm having to do so for this course
[22:04:58] <ShadeS> it's really annonying
[22:05:08] <taplar> oh, it's a class
[22:05:22] <taplar> well it that case, :)
[22:06:00] <ShadeS> it's precourse work i'm having to do to be accepted into a bootcamp
[22:06:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pfdzz7qw/
[22:06:10] <taplar> so show me what you got so far
[22:06:27] <ShadeS> and i'm really wasting so much time trying to figure out how to reuse a variable (which i'm told you should reuse variables instead of retyping strings all the time) but i'm having such a hard time doing so
[22:08:38] <ShadeS> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/pfdzz7qw/1/
[22:09:59] <taplar> i'm going to take out the streams part for now as it's undefined
[22:10:12] <ShadeS> ok
[22:10:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pfdzz7qw/3/
[22:10:18] <ShadeS> that doesn't really make a difference for now
[22:10:22] <taplar> right
[22:10:38] <taplar> ok, so line 7 your creating a new section
[22:10:53] <taplar> then your putting header after it
[22:11:14] <ShadeS> wait what?
[22:11:20] <ShadeS> I thought I was putting section AFTER header!
[22:12:03] <taplar> ah, i'm being stupid
[22:12:13] <taplar> after puts the data after it, hold on
[22:12:18] <ShadeS> yes
[22:12:35] <taplar> ok, so you create a header, put it on the page, then you create a section, put it after the header
[22:12:41] <ShadeS> yes
[22:12:52] <taplar> but then you do after again with the same element
[22:12:53] <ShadeS> now I wanted to add yet another section, after header, reusing my section variable
[22:13:01] <taplar> which will not have any affect as it's already after it
[22:13:20] <ShadeS> define 'it' and "it's"
[22:13:30] <taplar> your section is already after your header
[22:13:37] <ShadeS> yes
[22:13:47] <taplar> right, so if you want a new one, you'll have to clone your section
[22:13:48] <ShadeS> so now apparently I can't put anotherOneAfter()
[22:14:05] <ShadeS> so I should clone it before I add classes to it?
[22:14:35] <taplar> you could have section with just row on it
[22:14:41] <taplar> and then when you go to append it, clone it
[22:14:58] <taplar> then put the class on the cloned element
[22:15:21] <ShadeS> i'm not trying to append/nest the second section with in the first
[22:15:25] <ShadeS> i'm trying to add it after the first one
[22:15:32] <taplar> appending to the dom
[22:15:49] <taplar> or attaching
[22:16:01] <ShadeS> i thought append was to append to the element as a child
[22:16:08] <taplar> append() is
[22:16:18] <taplar> but the word append is contextual, :P
[22:16:29] <ShadeS> that adds to confusion
[22:16:32] <ShadeS> i can't seem to clone it properly
[22:16:37] <ShadeS> when i use clone it just breaks everything
[22:16:41] <taplar> what's your fiddle look like
[22:17:32] <ShadeS> so i have that first $(header).after(section); then I add        $(section).clone().after(section);
[22:17:39] <taplar> no
[22:17:41] <ShadeS> this thing I added, breaks the whole thing and no sections show up
[22:17:46] <taplar> after(section.clone())
[22:17:52] <ShadeS> whaaaaaaaaaat
[22:18:00] <taplar> you clone the section so it's a new element
[22:18:10] <taplar> so the original is not moved
[22:18:12] <ShadeS> that wasn't the syntax i was looking at in the jquery api
[22:19:16] <ShadeS> ok i have to put this specifically before i add the classes and stuff to it i guess
[22:19:28] <ShadeS> otherwise it doesn't do like I want it to it'll copy everything in the first section, to the 2nd
[22:19:38] <taplar> the first example in the docs have the clone on a lookup result
[22:19:40] <ShadeS> i guess i need to do itimmediately after I create the first one
[22:19:51] <taplar> but all you need is a jquery object, which you already have.
[22:21:46] <ShadeS> so... $(header).after(section) puts a section after header
[22:21:56] <taplar> puts that header after that section
[22:21:58] <ShadeS> when I $(header).after(section.clone()); it creates another one
[22:22:01] <taplar> since they are objects already
[22:22:04] <taplar> yup
[22:22:20] <ShadeS> when I $(section).addClass('row first'); it adds these class attributes to the SECOND section
[22:22:48] <taplar> update your fiddle?
[22:22:51] <ShadeS> if I $(section).first().addClass('row first') it still adds these class attributes to the second section
[22:22:55] <ngharo> are all sections going to be 'row'?
[22:23:07] <ngharo> because there are ways to target 'first' elements in css natively and in jquery
[22:23:17] <ngharo> perhaps you don't have to tag them with classes
[22:23:18] <ShadeS> https://jsfiddle.net/pfdzz7qw/4/
[22:23:52] <taplar> ok, so your attaching two sections
[22:24:01] <taplar> but the thing is the reference section is still just the first one
[22:24:24] <ShadeS> if it's the first one why are is addClass adding ('row first') to the second one?
[22:25:17] <taplar> it's not
[22:25:26] <ShadeS> it is on my page . . .
[22:25:26] <taplar> the second one is the first one after the header
[22:25:52] <taplar> your telling it to put the section after the header, not the other section
[22:26:04] <ShadeS> the clone, is before the first one, not AFTER it?
[22:26:09] <taplar> yep
[22:26:14] <ShadeS> that's really weird behavior
[22:26:16] <taplar> nope
[22:26:27] <ShadeS> i think it is really weird
[22:26:28] <taplar> like i said your telling it to go after the header
[22:26:31] <taplar> immediately after
[22:26:50] <taplar> it's not going to guess where you want it to go.  your telling it where to go
[22:27:04] <ShadeS> so if I were to $(section).after(section.clone()); it would add the clone AFTER the first section?
[22:27:32] <ShadeS> apparently so
[22:27:40] <taplar> it would be after whatever section is
[22:28:31] <ngharo> ShadeS: the "normal" way to add content after another is to append to a container of some sort
[22:29:00] <ShadeS> $(header).after(section); $(section).after(section.clone()); $(section).addClass('row first'); will add the classes to the FIRST section but should I really type out something like $(section).first().addClass('row first') ?
[22:29:14] <taplar> i was going to ask, is this the entirety of the problem?  meaning you don't have any existing html on the page at all?
[22:29:47] <ShadeS> well if I try to edit the html the jquery frys any existing changes with the first two lines: var $body = $('body'); $body.html('');
[22:29:59] <taplar> aaah, so yeah
[22:30:01] <ShadeS> asif done on purpose ot force me to use jquery to make /any&&every/change
[22:30:05] <taplar> in that case just append to the body
[22:30:17] <ShadeS> append what do the body?
[22:30:28] <taplar> your header, section1 and section2
[22:31:02] <ShadeS> i have $(body).prepend(header)
[22:31:09] <ShadeS> because i want header to be a child of body
[22:31:15] <taplar> that's fine, body is empty so it doesn't really matter
[22:31:16] <ShadeS> i guess since it's the first one it doesn't matter
[22:31:55] <ShadeS> but your'e saying I should $(body).after(section) ineastead of $(header).after(section) ?
[22:32:01] <taplar> no
[22:32:06] <taplar> i'm saying just switch to append
[22:32:29] <ShadeS> erm, which append from what and to what/
[22:32:36] <taplar> $body.append(...)
[22:32:51] <ShadeS> you mean change $body.prepend to $body.append ?
[22:32:59] <taplar> sure, but you don't have to that one
[22:33:23] <ShadeS> right, that's what i thought you meant by 'just switch to append' I thought you meant to switch $body.prepend(... to $body.append(...
[22:33:33] <taplar> the point is after() is used to put elements immediately after other elements.  but in your case you don't care about that
[22:33:42] <taplar> your just wanting header then section, then another section
[22:33:45] <taplar> which is appending
[22:33:56] <taplar> *to body
[22:34:02] <ShadeS> oh
[22:34:15] <ShadeS> is that more proper than doing after?
[22:34:23] <taplar> in this case it makes more sense
[22:34:42] <taplar> otherwise after the first section append you'd have to do an after on it, rather than the header
[22:34:48] <taplar> append simplifies this use case
[22:35:02] <ShadeS> something slightly changes when i switch those two
[22:35:07] <ShadeS> it formats just slightly different
[22:35:12] <taplar> update your fiddle
[22:35:18] <taplar> i can't see, :)
[22:36:32] <ShadeS> wait hold on a second here let me get this clear
[22:36:38] <taplar> sure
[22:37:07] <ShadeS> so for my header, section, section, I want to be doing $(body).append(..... instead of $(header).after(section; $(section).after(section.clone())
[22:37:19] <taplar> yep
[22:37:30] <ShadeS> any reason I should be just appending them to body?
[22:37:44] <ShadeS> I thought that if I after, it would guarantee being placed AFTER the last element
[22:37:51] <taplar> nope
[22:37:52] <ShadeS> but if I append to BODY then the order might not be like i want
[22:37:54] <taplar> append() is last
[22:40:20] <taplar> if you append to the body, the order is the order you append them
[22:42:05] <ShadeS> ok i think i am getting a better grasp of fuxing w/ this
[22:42:25] <ShadeS> once i put this refresh in the middle then i can move on to the next step
[22:42:40] <taplar> so you got it in the order you want?
[22:42:43] <Mark____> could anyone help me applying this js inside an iframe? http://manos.malihu.gr/repository/custom-scrollbar/demo/examples/scrollbar_themes_demo.html
[22:42:47] <ShadeS> i think so taplar
[22:42:54] <ShadeS> but i also got a much better understanding of jquery just now i think
[22:43:00] <ShadeS> which i guess is more important than styling it
[22:43:07] <ShadeS> cause it was more or less styled the way i wanted
[22:43:09] <taplar> cool, so i wanted to mention one thing after you got that down, :)
[22:43:11] <ShadeS> just wasn't correctly adding stuff
[22:43:17] <ShadeS> what
[22:43:48] <taplar> most of these variables, such as header and section, are already jquery objects.  so there's no need to do $(header) and $(section) before you use them
[22:44:14] <ShadeS> so it should just be header.addClass?
[22:44:20] <taplar> yep
[22:44:23] <ShadeS> without the $
[22:44:26] <ShadeS> ?
[22:44:37] <ShadeS> or with ?
[22:45:03] <taplar> since you named your variable that, yes.  when you see a variable with $ on the front, most js programmers do that to denote that the variable is a jquery object so they don't have to guess if they need to wrap it.  but it's up to taste.
[22:45:28] <ShadeS> but $body still needs to be $body ?
[22:45:38] <taplar> yep, cause that's how it was defined on ln 2
[22:45:46] <ShadeS> i guess for simplicity sake i should change header to be defined as $header for consistence
[22:45:50] <ShadeS> y
[22:45:55] <taplar> +1
[22:46:42] <taplar> also if you haven't taken it out yet, $(section).first(), you can remove the first()
[22:47:07] <ShadeS> why
[22:47:14] <taplar> section only contains one element
[22:47:21] <ShadeS> how does it know that I want to addClass to just the FIRST section
[22:47:44] <taplar> cause that's the reference you have
[22:48:01] <ShadeS> i don't follow, 'that's the reference you have'
[22:48:22] <taplar> when you do var something = $('<html>');
[22:48:34] <taplar> it creates a jquery object with the elements inside it as a result set
[22:48:40] <taplar> in your case your only creating one
[22:48:53] <taplar> cloning does not automatically add that second one to that result set
[22:48:54] <ShadeS> i'm not sure i follow
[22:49:23] <ShadeS> so if the clone line was after the addClass line, the 2nd section wouldn't also have 'row first' ?
[22:49:36] <taplar> no
[22:49:44] <ShadeS> that's weird
[22:49:51] <taplar> your only adding the class to the result set of section
[22:49:55] <ShadeS> if i'm cloning something i thought it would be a full clone not just a skeleton clone
[22:50:03] <ShadeS> 'result set' ?
[22:50:25] <taplar> jquery objects have an internal array of raw dom elements
[22:50:32] <taplar> their result set
[22:50:45] <taplar> which can be gotten from creating elements like you are, or doing a page lookup for elements
[22:51:15] <taplar> when you do someJqueryObject.clone()
[22:51:31] <taplar> it creates brand new elements for all the elements in the result set
[22:51:37] <taplar> but, it does not add them to the result set
[22:52:29] <taplar> have you read over any of the try.jquery.com or learn.jquery.com?
[22:52:30] <ShadeS> idk the difference between a result set and elements
[22:52:40] <ShadeS> yes i just did try.jquery before i tried tackling this
[22:52:51] <taplar> the result set is just an array in the jquery object of elemenets
[22:52:54] <ShadeS> it uses a lot of $(body) syntax
[22:54:15] <ShadeS> so $section.addClass('row first'); only adds row first to the first section.... how would I addClass to the SECOND section element?
[22:54:39] <taplar> you'll have to store the clone before you append it, and put the class on that
[22:54:49] <taplar> is the easiest way
[22:56:52] <ShadeS> i dont' know what you mean by store the clone
[22:57:02] <ShadeS> there's no direct way to $section.next() it or something?
[22:57:03] <taplar> var section2 = section.clone()
[22:57:11] <taplar> no
[22:57:16] <ShadeS> what really?
[22:57:22] <taplar> you only have the first element
[22:57:27] <taplar> there is no next as far as it is aware
[22:57:49] <ShadeS> no nextSibling or anything?
[22:58:03] <taplar> you could look it up in the body
[22:58:13] <taplar> but simply storing it would be more efficient
[23:00:07] <ShadeS> beacuse I was going to do something like $section.first().next();
[23:00:24] <ShadeS> still don't get why $section.addClass('row first') only adds it to the first section and not all of them
[23:00:34] <taplar> cause you don't have all of them
[23:00:43] <taplar> already said that, :|
[23:00:45] <ShadeS> what do you mean all of 'them' ?
[23:00:54] <ShadeS> yeah I missed that I guess I didn't understand something when you said it
[23:00:55] <taplar> section only contains the first one, not the cloned one
[23:01:28] <ShadeS> but if I $('section').addClass then it would have applied them to BOTH ?
[23:01:33] <ShadeS> i think that's what i was trying to get at
[23:01:41] <taplar> yes
[23:01:45] <ShadeS> ok word
[23:01:46] <taplar> because that would be a lookup
[23:01:50] <taplar> which would find them all in the body
[23:01:53] <ShadeS> WORD.
[23:01:58] <taplar> but you don't want that
[23:01:58] <ShadeS> i'm starting to 'get this'
[23:02:00] <taplar> in this case
[23:02:02] <ShadeS> no i don't not in this case
[23:02:14] <taplar> :)
[23:10:28] <taplar> ugh, i'm going to have to crash soon.  you doing ok now?
[23:59:15] <Mark____> can anyone help me with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35283943/custom-scrollbar-gets-loaded-but-not-visible/35284018#35284018
