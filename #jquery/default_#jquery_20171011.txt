[01:48:31] <Guest47416> Hello is this Jquery Chat room?
[01:50:44] <Guest47416> BB. I will use email to ask for help. Thank you.
[01:55:19] <Woet> ok
[02:19:49] <V7> Hey all
[02:20:14] <V7> When border-radius is changed on mouseover to see difference I need to change it's padding i.e.
[02:20:20] <V7> Do you know how to fix it ?
[02:48:43] <Cork> V7: i would recommend just toggling a class (or use :hover) and set the info you need there
[02:49:06] <V7> addClass doesn't work too
[02:49:10] <Cork> you normally want to keep css in the stylescheet not scattered around in your js file
[02:49:15] <Cork> what?
[02:49:30] <V7> It add's class, but nothing changes (visually)
[02:49:45] <Cork> can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[02:50:41] <V7> It's strange that it works if I'm implmeneting it in jsFiddle
[02:51:13] <Cork> not really
[02:51:17] <V7> So ... the fix was .css( "border-radius", "0px 0px 0px 0px" ).css( "background", "#fff" );
[02:51:19] <Cork> it just means the error is somewhere else
[02:51:32] <Cork> are you sure the selector matches?
[02:51:43] <V7> Changing background redraws border
[02:51:48] <V7> Cork: yes
[02:52:02] <Cork> do you have an !important in your css file?
[02:52:06] <V7> yes
[02:52:10] <Cork> ...
[02:52:25] <Cork> you can't override an !important with .css
[02:52:28] <V7> I told you it just doesn't redraw it
[02:52:39] <V7> ))
[02:53:00] <V7> Changing Background redraws border-radius
[02:53:09] <V7> How weird it is, but it's true
[02:53:26] <Cork> if you have !important on those values in the css file you can't override it with js
[02:53:52] <V7> So how then background changes border-radius ?
[02:54:04] <Cork> cause you don't have !important on the background?
[02:54:10] <V7> I have
[02:54:20] <Cork> again, reproduce the problem in jsfiddle
[02:54:47] <Cork> (what you state can't be correct so your missing something)
[03:01:42] <V7> could be
[06:46:39] <Ice_Strike> $('input[name="name"]').on('change', function() { });
[06:46:49] <Ice_Strike> Why it could not detect input change when user type?
[06:48:15] <Ice_Strike> Oh it work, have to blur out
[07:15:39] <Cork> Ice_Strike: you want the input event
[07:34:19] <dimi1947> can you remind me please which method hides an element from the DOM..it is STILL there though,it is just hidden
[07:34:31] <cannap> display:none
[07:34:40] <Cork> .hide() is the method
[07:34:47] <cannap> ah what
[07:34:49] <cannap> sure? :P
[07:37:06] <dimi1947> Cork:thanks...and if I want to unhide it?
[07:37:19] <Cork> guess?
[07:37:27] <dimi1947> show()
[07:37:30] <Cork> bingo
[07:37:40] <dimi1947> thx
[07:37:54] <Cork> also have a look at api.jquery.com
[08:10:03] <jak2000> hi all
[08:11:09] <jak2000> i am cloning a div.... https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/b7q5tdsw/2/    all work fine... but i test on production and not work...not know why i am lost hours or more... exist other way for do this:     $(this).next('select.clselect2').html(xsel);
[08:13:26] <jak2000> not fill the second select (in my production code) :(
[08:21:16] <jak2000> cork escuse me ask directly, any advice?
[08:22:54] <Cork> jak2000: so the fiddle works but not in production?
[08:23:23] <Cork> can you define what doesn't work?
[08:25:06] <Cork> jak2000: uh... you'r adding a <select> inside a select element...
[08:25:59] <jak2020> yes, the values/options of second select depend of the first select....
[08:26:41] <Cork> no your creating <select><select><option>A</option><option>B</option></select></select>
[08:26:56] <jak2020> mmm sample select1 can contain Drink/cars   and second (if select1 was selected 'Drink) secondwould be filled only with drinks: cocacola pepsi, budligth, tea and so on...
[08:27:48] <jak2020> ann then need add a div wait
[08:30:14] <jak2020> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/b7q5tdsw/3/
[08:30:43] <jak2020> but, work, any idea how to do this line:  $(this).next('div.cldivSelect2').html(xsel);   different way?
[08:31:08] <Cork> jak2020: your still adding a select inside a select
[08:31:36] <Cork> ah, no you added an extra div around it...
[08:31:42] <Cork> (why not just remove the extra select...)
[08:32:21] <jak2020> yes
[08:32:21] <Cork> jak2020: i'm not sure what it is you're trying to do...
[08:32:43] <jak2020> ok first.... i want clone.... al the main div
[08:32:44] <Cork> for the select problem i would just do https://jsfiddle.net/b7q5tdsw/4/
[08:33:36] <Cork> and a fix for the broken option html https://jsfiddle.net/b7q5tdsw/5/
[08:33:40] <jak2020> ok understand
[08:34:26] <Cork> jak2020: if what you're asking about is why the original select element isn't in the clone instead of the new one
[08:34:33] <Cork> then well... it is cause you replace it
[08:34:34] <jak2020> ahh yes /option...
[08:35:06] <jak2020> i am ask, .. here work when you select any option on first select....
[08:35:15] <Cork> you would have to keep a pristine copy of the row if you wanted that to work
[08:35:35] <Cork> jak2020: i have no clue what you just said...
[08:35:52] <jak2020> ok
[08:36:12] <jak2020> in the fiddle the work was done, but i change my production code and not work
[08:36:24] <Cork> what doesn't work?
[08:37:00] <jak2020> 1) user select any option in select1, 2) fill select 2.  <--- this step not work on my production code
[08:37:34] <Cork> so you most likely have something inbetween the two selects
[08:37:39] <jak2020> my question is: other way for do: $(this).next('select.clselect2').html(xsel);
[08:37:52] <Cork> you query .next('selector') so if the next element doesn't match you will get nothing
[08:38:18] <Cork> i would prob do $(this).nextAll('select.clselect2').first().html(xsel)
[08:39:30] <MikeD_> seems like a strange way to relate a dependent select
[08:39:46] <jak2020> Cork test....
[08:40:03] <jak2020> testing $(this).nextAll('select.clselect2').first().html(xsel);
[08:40:40] <Cork> well you could also do $(this).closest('div').find('select.clselect')
[08:40:47] <jak2020> other way is get the id of the element(select1) in this case: select_00  and split... get the 00 and force the job via id
[08:41:06] <Cork> jak2020: i would prob remove the id and use a class (without the number) instead
[08:41:25] <Cork> so <div class="meal"></div>
[08:42:34] <jak2020> Cork: worked:  $(this).nextAll('select.clselTipoProducto2').first().html(json.xhtmlProductos);
[08:43:13] <jak2020> a mre bit eeasy question.... same fiddle:
[08:44:09] <jak2020> *more
[08:44:19] <jak2020> forget. :)
[08:45:42] <jak2020> how to do this: the users start typing data... and by error press F5, how to say a message: really you want reload the page?
[08:47:59] * jak2020 checking: <Xatenev> jak2020, like jQuery(window).bind("unload"
[09:32:18] <samsamek> How do you get request a URL and get the output content (json object)?
[09:54:57] <V7> Hey all ;)
[09:55:15] <V7> Is possible to make this child element to SlideUp/SlideDown https://jsfiddle.net/aq9yjv9n/17/ and how ?
[10:00:11] <Cork> V7: you would have to dig into what api datatables provide
[10:00:52] <V7> Yes, but I'll show you a fiddle
[10:10:44] <V7> https://jsfiddle.net/aq9yjv9n/19/
[10:10:53] <V7> Could you please check it out
[10:10:57] <V7> As you see doesn't work
[10:12:49] <V7> I mean opacity works, but
[10:13:24] <V7> This one doesn't https://jsfiddle.net/aq9yjv9n/20/
[10:13:36] <V7> When I'm changing opacity to height
[10:13:46] <V7> So it can't change height slowly ...
[10:14:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/aq9yjv9n/21/
[10:15:44] <V7> Yeah taplar it works, but is it possible to change opacity to height ?
[10:15:53] <V7> I mean to change height ( not the opacity )
[10:16:45] <taplar> why couldn't you?
[10:17:01] <taplar> try it and see
[10:17:03] <V7> I've tried, but I can't set height on yt
[10:17:05] <V7> tr *
[10:26:54] <V7> So any one ?
[10:27:21] <V7> Height of tr just unsets
[11:30:09] <dimi1947> imagine that you have 2 or more input boxes or divs and by the click of a button you want to hide only the last one...I used hide() for that but after hiding the last element clicking the icon once more the next to last div is not hidden cause the hide operation is affection the allready hidden div:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/y8cfvuev/   click the minus icon to see for yourself
[12:36:37] <definitelynotjq> Is it possible to get a data-id from an event.target?
[12:37:00] <taplar_> data() works on any jquery object
[12:37:13] <definitelynotjq> It doesn't seem to work on e.target o.O
[12:37:19] <taplar> cause it's not a jquery object
[12:37:29] <definitelynotjq> K
[12:37:40] <taplar> so to fix that you .... ?
[12:37:42] <definitelynotjq> So that doesn't answer my question
[12:37:46] <taplar> lol
[12:37:47] <definitelynotjq> Idk
[12:37:51] <taplar> $(event.target) dude
[12:37:58] <definitelynotjq> Orly
[12:38:02] <definitelynotjq> Didn't know you could use that as a selector
[12:38:04] <definitelynotjq> Hrmm
[12:38:14] <taplar> $() can take a selector or dom element
[12:38:24] <definitelynotjq> TIL
[12:38:25] <definitelynotjq> :)
[12:38:26] <taplar> it doesn't do a lookup in the latter
[12:39:32] <definitelynotjq> Woot, and now it works
[12:39:34] <definitelynotjq> Ty ty
[12:39:37] <taplar> sure
[13:01:40] <jQueryQs> Hey guys, https://jsfiddle.net/g407mzks/ How can I check for each option value? I tried adding an each statement before the if() but I never got an error, I just need to check if each option value is -1 if it is, add the warning
[13:03:07] <taplar> where's the loop?
[13:03:27] <jQueryQs> It's not in that fiddle, but it was wrapped around the if else statement
[13:03:58] <taplar> can you put that version in the fiddle?
[13:03:59] <jQueryQs> I just figured I did it wrong, and would like to see where I should be adding the each loop
[13:05:02] <kim366> Let's say I have an array of objects and I want to get another array, which is for each element .someProperty. Is it possible to do that without a loop?
[13:05:13] <taplar> so can you state, simply, the logic that you are trying to achieve?
[13:05:18] <robertmaxrees> kim366 huh?
[13:05:48] <taplar> kim366: use the map() method off of the array
[13:05:58] <kim366> Ah, sounds promising
[13:06:24] <robertmaxrees> kim366 are you working with a jquery object or a native array?
[13:06:38] <kim366> No, it's not actually jquery, sorry
[13:06:40] <robertmaxrees> and are you trying to get only elements meeting a specific criteria or transform it into some kind of data?
[13:07:02] <jQueryQs> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/g407mzks/2/
[13:07:23] <taplar> uh, lol
[13:07:29] <jQueryQs> so I realized that my var is only grabbing one value (the first option available) not each one
[13:07:35] <taplar> right
[13:07:41] <kim366> nvm, actually. I was thinking wron in general
[13:07:47] <taplar> again, can you say in english what it is you are trying to do?
[13:07:54] <taplar> "when ...., then i want ..."
[13:08:33] <taplar> or "when ..., then ... should ..."
[13:08:39] <taplar> etc
[13:09:56] <jQueryQs> if user clicks "first" check required selects, if option value == 1 add warning
[13:10:05] <taplar> which option value == -1?
[13:10:10] <taplar> any or all?
[13:10:13] <jQueryQs> all
[13:10:30] <taplar> so, conversly, you don't want to add an error if none of them are -1
[13:10:48] <taplar> true?
[13:10:53] <jQueryQs> true
[13:11:19] <taplar> so you can check that by doing $(selector).filter(function(){ return this.value === '-1';  }).length;
[13:11:34] <taplar> if length is 0, none are -1
[13:12:41] <jQueryQs> so I can just replace my current if with my filter? and do the logic in there?
[13:12:58] <kim366> taplar: I wanted something that I didn't want..
[13:13:08] <taplar> kim366: lol, what?
[13:13:17] <kim366> I didn't know I didn't want it :)
[13:13:20] <taplar> jQueryQs: give it a shot, :)
[13:13:40] <robertmaxrees> kim366 what is it that you wnat?
[13:14:01] <kim366> I want to iterate through an array and get the individual values of each object
[13:14:18] <kim366> For which I will use $.each, since that's nice
[13:14:26] <taplar> map
[13:14:47] <kim366> Is it actually possible to rename object properties?
[13:14:48] <taplar> and like robert asked earlier, is this still a jquery object?
[13:15:13] <kim366> I have [{id: 15}, {id: 21}] and I want [{value: 15}, {value: 21}]
[13:16:19] <kim366> It is an array
[13:16:25] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[13:16:39] <kim366> Ok, I see
[13:17:24] <taplar> though, is there a reason why the array is being constructed in that manner to begin with?
[13:17:31] <taplar> if you are going to change the keys?
[13:17:53] <kim366> Because I am reading my own json and I am providing it to a library
[13:18:07] <kim366> I could rename the keys in the json, I guess
[13:18:09] <taplar> does anything else in your logic use it in the id form it is in?
[13:18:24] <taplar> :)
[13:20:15] <kim366> No, not yet. It is early enough to change
[13:20:35] <kim366> I at first wasn't thinking about just passing the whole array
[13:36:05] <jQueryQs> taplar thanks :D
[13:36:24] <jQueryQs> and im here thinking i needed an each loop :;
[13:38:27] <taplar> filter does the loop for you
[13:39:49] <robertmaxrees> descriptive of a result, instead of prescrptive of the method
[13:40:52] <jQueryQs> robert is that related to me?
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[13:41:31] <robertmaxrees> if you think you need to loop, you probably don't.
[13:43:10] <jQueryQs> good advice :D
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> and if you DO need to loop, don't use for loops.
[14:17:18] <jQueryQs>  taplar, so it keeps checking the first conditional
[14:17:45] <taplar> show me?
[14:18:59] <jQueryQs> https://jsfiddle.net/tpLhhf6o/2/ taplar
[14:19:41] <jQueryQs> so i tried two different conditions in the else if I changed it from ! to === 0 to make sure that warning doesn't exist. Warning is removed when a user selects an option
[14:20:08] <taplar> you're not doing the .length
[14:20:21] <taplar> filter() will always return a jquery object, which objects are truthy
[14:22:10] <jQueryQs> what do you mean by I'm not doing the .length
[14:22:28] <taplar> line 3
[14:22:51] <taplar> that's always going to be true as it is
[14:23:41] <jQueryQs> so something like this then? https://jsfiddle.net/tpLhhf6o/3/
[14:26:01] <taplar> yeah, though I don't believe you need the else clause
[14:26:16] <taplar> else if, that is.  just an else i would think would work for this situation
[14:26:29] <taplar> either some are -1 or none are
[14:26:40] <jQueryQs> k
[14:27:29] <jQueryQs> testing now thanks again
[15:04:47] <Neobenedict> hi i'm looking for some dynamic "tag" system like how outlook does emails (you type the email, and outlook "groups" it and can also replace the contents while still keeping the original value in the background) - anyone know something similar
[15:06:42] <Neobenedict> found something http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/
[15:14:20] <jQueryQs> taplar thanks a ton!
[15:14:21] <jQueryQs> :)
[15:16:46] <taplar> got it?
[15:17:13] <jQueryQs> yup
[15:18:10] <definitelynotjq> Is it just me or does .scroll only detect vertical scrolling?
[15:18:37] <definitelynotjq> taplar aka mr expert all knowing alien person
[15:19:02] <taplar> i was fixing to try it out in a fiddle.  i would expect it to catch both
[15:19:26] <definitelynotjq> Ahhh
[15:19:42] <definitelynotjq> Yeah I have $(document).on("scroll", ".filterPreviewFrame", function(){ etc }
[15:19:46] <definitelynotjq> And it doesn't seem to fire
[15:20:48] <grapheti> Neobenedict, https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/ ?
[15:21:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/89tuL9j6/  yeah it catches both scrolls
[15:21:42] <definitelynotjq> Hrmmmm wtf then
[15:21:51] <taplar> which makes me ask what type of element 'filterPreviewFrame' is
[15:22:10] <taplar> because if it is an iframe, scroll events probably don't propagate out of it
[15:22:14] <definitelynotjq> It's a div
[15:22:18] <definitelynotjq> That horizontally scrolls
[15:22:18] <taplar> hmm
[15:22:50] <definitelynotjq> Hmmm is right
[15:22:51] <definitelynotjq> :/
[15:24:06] <grapheti> http://jsfiddle.net/z4qmz/ - that looks cool
[15:24:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/89tuL9j6/1/  div works too
[15:25:15] <definitelynotjq> Ok, so it's not detecting vertical scroll there either
[15:25:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/89tuL9j6/2/
[15:25:26] <shoky> scroll events don't bubble up from elements, i think
[15:25:32] <taplar> so it appears the issue is that scroll doesn't bubble from the element
[15:25:50] <definitelynotjq> That last fiddle doesn't work
[15:25:53] <taplar> right
[15:25:56] <definitelynotjq> Ok
[15:25:58] <taplar> as per my and shoky's statement
[15:26:05] <grapheti> no one asked you shoky!
[15:26:16] <definitelynotjq> Bubble up from elements?
[15:26:23] <definitelynotjq> What does that mean o.O
[15:26:34] <taplar> event propagate up from child to parent nodes
[15:26:35] * shoky throws acid in his own face
[15:26:37] <taplar> unless they don't
[15:26:40] <grapheti> :O
[15:26:46] <shoky> on*
[15:27:23] <definitelynotjq> So basically I can't detect scroll then?
[15:27:28] <shoky> definitelynotjq: you're trying to catch the scroll event on a different element from where it was triggered
[15:27:33] <taplar> not without directly binding on the element
[15:27:42] <definitelynotjq> I can't direct bind because it's loaded via ajax
[15:27:48] <definitelynotjq> So it will never fire
[15:27:54] <definitelynotjq> that why I'm using the document.on
[15:27:55] <taplar> you can directly bind in the ajax logic that creates the element
[15:28:06] <definitelynotjq> Hrmmm wuyt
[15:28:23] <taplar> the ajax adds the div to the page, yes?
[15:28:26] <definitelynotjq> Yes
[15:28:36] <grapheti> batman kissing batman in front of the sunset shoky - http://i.imgur.com/H2ah5A7.jpg
[15:28:36] <taplar> so in that same logic, after it adds it, it could do the direct binding
[15:28:50] <definitelynotjq> Ohhhhhhh I know what you're saying
[15:29:09] <shoky> that was uncalled for, grapheti !
[15:29:13] <definitelynotjq> But the goal is that there are multiple horizontally scrolling ajax added divs, that I want to all horizontally scroll when you scroll any of them
[15:29:15] <grapheti> LOL
[15:29:18] <definitelynotjq> Does that make sense?
[15:29:26] <definitelynotjq> I want them to scroll in sync with eachother
[15:29:34] <taplar> right, but you have to deal with the nature of the scroll event not bubbling
[15:29:39] <taplar> wait, what?
[15:29:43] <definitelynotjq> Lol
[15:30:07] <taplar> you scroll one div, you want the others to scroll too?
[15:30:17] <definitelynotjq> Yep
[15:30:24] <taplar> >.>
[15:30:40] <grapheti> some hawt scroll spy action?
[15:30:47] <taplar> in any case, direct binding is what you'd have to do for the scroll event
[15:31:03] <definitelynotjq> But to .each() them would be a nightmare
[15:31:03] <definitelynotjq> o.O
[15:31:08] <taplar> y?
[15:31:15] <definitelynotjq> With them being dynamically added and such?
[15:31:32] <taplar> are you adding them all at once, or one at a time or.... ?
[15:31:47] <definitelynotjq> 1+ at a time
[15:31:57] <taplar> so you bind just on the one you are fixing to append
[15:32:11] <definitelynotjq> I'm confused
[15:32:19] <definitelynotjq> Cause I want you to scroll any of them, and all of them to scroll
[15:32:36] <taplar> var $newGuy = $(someHTML);  $newGuy.on('scroll', ...);  $(parentSelector).append($newGuy);
[15:33:24] <shoky> you can also use .on()  on multiple elements of course
[15:33:25] <definitelynotjq> Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[15:33:31] <taplar> ^
[15:34:02] <definitelynotjq> I had to add all those h's to dramatize
[15:34:10] <taplar> i felt it
[15:34:13] <shoky> i'm still reading them
[15:34:21] <definitelynotjq> LOl
[15:34:28] <grapheti> I think I'm at 22.
[15:34:46] <taplar> at some point of reading them i started being concerned you were actually expressing pain
[15:34:46] <definitelynotjq> Well there are 119
[15:34:57] <grapheti> lmao
[15:35:13] <definitelynotjq> :P
[15:35:23] <definitelynotjq> Grrr I don't wanna code this
[15:35:28] <grapheti> pain or orgasm ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[15:35:35] <definitelynotjq> I think I'll nap first
[15:35:41] <grapheti> rip
[15:35:44] <definitelynotjq> Lol
[15:35:48] * taplar hesitates to respond to grapheti
[15:36:03] <grapheti> :D
[15:36:32] <grapheti> shoky, have you tried this vue.js?
[15:37:07] <shoky> nopes but i know it, not rly new anymore ;p
[15:37:20] <grapheti> hehe
[15:37:34] <taplar> i started lingering around their s.o. pages lately
[15:37:53] <grapheti> I'm in <3 with it
[15:38:24] <taplar> how do you ... <3
[15:38:27] <taplar> k
[15:38:35] <grapheti> print out the source code ez
[15:38:35] * taplar *ahem*
[15:38:49] <taplar> we can tell, your <3 is in full vue
[15:38:59] <grapheti> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9LTY37lQdU
[15:40:46] <taplar> lol
[15:41:10] <taplar> i wasn't sure where that was going for a moment
[15:41:45] <grapheti> Eh, just gonna give Evan You a handy if we meet at a restaurant.

[15:52:15] <jak2000> hi all"
[15:52:27] <taplar> aloha
[15:52:41] <jak2000> is possible save data (html table with 6 rows) on memory? (stream) ?
[15:53:07] <taplar> what are you calling a 'stream'?
[15:54:44] <jak2000> in a object
[15:54:51] <jak2000> wait
[15:55:09] <jak2000> same as session variabel (server side) save any data
[15:55:36] <taplar> you can stick a string value in localStorage/sessionStorage
[15:56:47] <jak2000> how to?
[15:57:04] <jak2000> i can save to a temporary table (wth ajax) but... not want do this
[15:57:17] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[16:00:42] <taplar> jak2000: please keep the questions within the public room
[16:05:54] <jak2000> ok
[16:06:56] <jak2000> taplar: can i save a entire HTML table?
[16:07:32] <taplar> sure
[16:07:37] <jak2000> localStorage.setItem('myTAble1', $("#mytable").html());
[16:07:42] <jak2000> something like this?
[16:07:44] <taplar> yep
[16:08:06] <taplar> iirc the limit on localStorage as far as mobile devices go, one had a limit of 2MB
[16:08:15] <taplar> but most the others were like 4MB or more
[16:08:58] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[16:11:53] <jak2000> ok in the morning my friend Cork helped me with cloning a Div
[16:12:21] <dsc_> Ah, Cork - good guy
[16:12:47] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/b7q5tdsw/5/  <---- here the fidlle work.....
[16:13:31] <jak2000> but in my production code not, i think the bootstrap have something that fail
[16:14:00] <jak2000> the clone was done.... all ok, but the line: 25 not do the work, same as in the fidle....
[16:15:21] <jak2000> in the moring i am say: <jak2020> Cork: worked:  $(this).nextAll('select.clselTipoProducto2').first().html(json.xhtmlProductos);  but i forced change the value via ID (i dont see it)
[16:15:35] <jak2000> i continue with the problem, no error on console, only not fill the second Select...
[16:16:30] <jak2000> exist a plugin or way verify: if this: $(this).nextAll('select.clselTipoProducto2').first().html(json.xhtmlProductos);  or: $(this).next('select.clselect2').html(xsel); where fail?
[16:17:12] <taplar> you'll most likely want to console log the result of your nextAll() and next() to see what they are finding
[16:17:36] <jak2000> mmm
[16:18:01] <jak2000> console.log($(this).next('select.clselect2')) ?  or  console.log($(this).nextAll('select.clselTipoProducto2').first());   ?
[16:18:13] <taplar> without the first(), and both
[16:18:46] <jak2000> console.log($(this).next('select.clselect2')) ?  or  console.log($(this).nextAll('select.clselTipoProducto2'));
[16:18:52] <jak2000> cheking....
[16:19:31] <taplar> because if it's not working, first you would need to verify that it is finding elements to change
[16:21:21] <jak2000> cheking:
[16:21:22] <jak2000> console.log('=============='+$(this).next('select.clselTipoProducto2'));
[16:21:22] <jak2000>                     console.log('=============='+$(this).nextAll('select.clselTipoProducto2'));
[16:22:35] <jak2000> in both cases say: ==============[object Object]
[16:22:38] <jak2000> now?
[16:29:34] <jak2000> taplar?
[16:32:32] <taplar> take out the "=====" part
[16:34:51] <jak2000> ooo
[16:34:54] <jak2000> in both cases: [prevObject: m.fn.init(1), context: undefined]
[16:35:05] <taplar> so neither found any elements
[16:36:17] <jak2000> without clonning the dive i get the: [prevObject: m.fn.init(1), context: undefined]
[16:37:01] <taplar> that shows no results
[16:37:51] <jak2000> check this image: https://postimg.org/image/4ruj227mu3/
[16:37:55] <jak2000> wich is wrong?
[16:38:35] <taplar> that select has nothing after it
[16:38:43] <taplar> next() and nextAll() work on siblings
[16:38:59] <taplar> those select have only one sibling, which is the label before it
[16:39:01] <jak2000> the event change is on.... the first select
[16:39:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/b7q5tdsw/5/  <-- this fiddle you had.  all those select are on the same level, belonging to the same parent, they are all siblings
[16:40:05] <jak2000> ooo
[16:40:13] <jak2000> then how to fix my problem?
[16:40:24] <jak2000> bootstrap work with dv and divs...
[16:41:47] <jak2000> see: https://pastebin.com/HVEqT2KV
[16:43:30] <taplar> so i'm not entirely clear from https://postimg.org/image/4ruj227mu3/ what you are wanting to do with the second one  if you change the first one
[16:43:34] <jak2000> i solved the problem..... get the id:  'selTipoProducto1_01' split the name and get the '01' and force witht the id...
[16:44:53] <jak2000> ok first select have: initially: 1) Drinks 2) Cars 3) Travels...
[16:45:32] <jak2000> secodn select is empty...... if user select: Drinks i want fill the second select with: 1)Bud Light 2) Coca cola, 3) water 4) teal..
[16:45:36] <jak2000> understand me?
[16:46:01] <taplar> k
[16:46:18] <taplar> so yeah, the use of 'next' in that case is kinda awkward
[16:46:25] <jak2000> yes understand
[16:46:29] <jak2000> but how to solve?
[16:46:43] <taplar> you know you are changing 'x', and it should change 'y'.  just target 'y'
[16:46:59] <jak2000> yes
[16:47:12] <jak2000> but remember the controls was cloned.....
[16:47:43] <jak2000> i solved this:
[16:47:46] <taplar> so one 'x' is associated with multiple 'y'?
[16:47:56] <jak2000> yes
[16:48:07] <taplar> are there multiple 'x' elements?
[16:48:23] <jak2000> yes
[16:48:34] <jak2000> but the relation is '1 to many'
[16:48:38] <taplar> and one 'x' element should only affect a subset of 'y' elements?
[16:48:47] <jak2000> yes
[16:48:54] <taplar> how are 'x' elements segregated?
[16:49:15] <jak2000> is a catalog saved on a table.
[16:49:21] <taplar> no, in the markup
[16:49:51] <taplar> visualize boxes
[16:50:05] <taplar> imagine a box with an 'x' and a bunch of 'y' in it
[16:50:19] <jak2000> ok
[16:50:20] <taplar> then imagine a bunch of those boxes
[16:50:29] <jak2000> yes...
[16:50:32] <taplar> is your markup setup in such a way similar to that?
[16:51:27] <taplar> the box border being the parent elements that separate the 'x' from each other
[16:51:50] <jak2000> yes: a box named: Drinks and  under/into it 'bud light' 'coca cola'  'water' 'tea'   other box: Travels: 'Japan' 'India' 'Brazil' <-- right?
[16:51:59] <jak2000> yes
[16:52:22] <taplar> so each 'x' has a parent on some level, that has siblings the each one has it's own 'x' inside it?
[16:53:00] <jak2000> mmm
[16:53:14] <jak2000> yes
[16:53:29] <taplar> alright, does each of those parent's have a common class on them?
[16:53:53] <jak2000> yes
[16:54:33] <taplar> alright so you can start off by doing something like
[16:54:48] <taplar> $(theXelement).closest(classOnTheParent)
[16:55:01] <jak2000> dude: closest is my frend.. ok testing
[16:55:10] <taplar> this will go up the dom tree to find the parent that contains the 'x' and it's associated 'y', understand?
[16:55:19] <jak2000> yes testing
[16:55:21] <taplar> k
[16:55:28] <jak2000> can i explain how to solved?
[16:55:41] <taplar> if you get it working, i don't really need to know, :)
[16:56:08] <jak2000> but i want if is horrible if is good or bad.
[16:56:13] <jak2000> :)
[16:56:22] <taplar> heh, fine
[16:57:08] <jak2000> i solved the problem..... get the id:  'selTipoProducto1_01' split the name and get the '01' and force witht the id...
[16:57:17] <taplar> yeah, don't do that
[16:57:25] <jak2000> var selTipoProducto = $(this).val();        var xArr = this.id.split('_');        var xId = xArr[1];
[16:57:35] <jak2000> and then: $('#selTipoProducto2_' + xId).html(json.xhtmlProductos);
[16:57:37] <jak2000> :)
[16:57:42] <taplar> you can't repeat ids
[16:57:49] <taplar> that would only target one other element
[16:57:58] <jak2000> but i have unique ids.
[16:58:11] <taplar> so you're going to repeat that lookup and html() setting?
[16:58:12] <jak2000> ok checking your way
[16:59:05] <taplar> $(x).closest('.classOnSharedParentOfTheXandY').find('.classOnAllTheY').html(json.xhtmlProductos);
[16:59:10] <taplar> that's really what you want
[17:04:02] <jak2000> the class X='clselTipoProducto' Y='clselTipoProducto2'
[17:05:10] <jak2000> class parent X,Y: clonedInput
[17:05:50] <jak2000> explain me $(x)  please...
[17:07:21] <taplar> x would be the x element that was changed
[17:07:36] <jak2000> $this()
[17:07:39] <taplar> the 'this' or e.target in the event handler
[17:07:42] <jak2000> error $(this)
[17:09:20] <jak2000> checking: console.log($(this).closest('.clonedInput').find('.clselTipoProducto2'));
[17:09:53] <taplar> what is 'clonedInput'?
[17:10:56] <jak2000> the main div
[17:10:59] <jak2000> [prevObject: m.fn.init(0), context: undefined, selector: ".clselTipoProducto2"]
[17:11:16] <taplar> there are multiple clonedInput's?
[17:11:28] <jak2000> only 1
[17:11:36] <taplar> that's not going to work then
[17:11:38] <jak2000> because not clined (hit button click).
[17:11:54] <taplar> as i said, the parent that you do closest to, needs to be a parent that contains only one x
[17:12:45] <jak2000> ok
[17:17:21] <jak2000> see my class x: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/o63y67mq/
[17:17:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/nue255ff/
[17:17:51] <jak2000> line 1 to 54
[17:18:34] <jak2000> ok
[17:18:36] <jak2000> checking
[17:25:40] <jak2000> done........... done the work :)
[17:26:21] <jak2000> thanks
[17:26:33] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[17:28:07] <jak2000> have a url for learn more about this? closest.... next, prev... i understand that exist official documentation.....  but any for dummies dummies ?
[17:28:44] <taplar> learn.jquery.com
[17:28:53] <taplar> and to some extent, try.jquery.com
[17:30:03] <taplar> but learn.jquery.com is more conversational of an approach, vs the documentation which is more slim and straight to business
[17:31:33] <jak2000> ok thanks
[17:32:49] <jak2000> ok continue now with:  localStorage.setItem('myTAble1', $("#mytable").html());
[17:33:18] <jak2000> wich is better localstorage or cache?   wich can retreive data if browser was closed (crash).
[17:33:31] <taplar> localStorage persists through browser closes
[17:33:44] <taplar> provided the users are not in a private session and do not clear their cache
[17:33:44] <jak2000> ok. thanks
[17:34:08] <jak2000> you worked with bootstrap?
[17:34:17] <taplar> sessionStorage is like localStorage, but it differs in that it clears when the browser is closed
[17:34:28] <taplar> to some extent, yes.  mostly just with the styles
[17:40:40] <jak2000> ok, have a close button and not understand how to close, but now i see this the trick: data-dismiss="modal"
[17:42:54] <jak2000> exist a way, in the broser for see a localstorage variable? the content?
[17:43:15] <jak2000> localStorage.setItem('myTable_01', $("#myTablePesoProd_01").html());
[17:46:35] <taplar> yeah, that's how you do it
[17:47:38] <jak2000> oo interssting: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9404813/how-to-view-or-edit-localstorage
[17:47:53] <johnrisby> hi all. using semantic ui with sylius (sylius uses it by default). I can't find site.variables anywhere. should it be there? or should I create my own? if I create my own, where and what do I need to make it work? thanks
[17:49:02] <jak2000> done done....
[17:49:36] <jak2000> opened, a new chrome window and go to local storage for see and not say. anything
[17:49:55] <taplar> ?
[17:50:10] <jak2000> yes. same window as my system:
[17:50:30] <taplar> what are you doing that you are saying you see nothing?
[17:50:57] <jak2000> same chrome window:   see: https://postimg.org/image/1tq16u1qi3/
[17:51:22] <taplar> k?
[17:51:43] <jak2000> new chrome window: http://postimg.org/image/3aw68lkfxn/6d2bc46a/
[17:51:59] <jak2000> here not see the: 'myTable_01'
[17:52:17] <jak2000> you say, if chrome was closed... the data persist on local storage.
[17:52:43] <taplar> you're looking at the localstorage for some google.com.mx site...
[17:53:26] <taplar> go to your console and do: localStorage.getItem('myTable_01')
[17:53:26] <jak2000> oo now understand
[17:54:18] <jak2000> strange: i do this:
[17:54:20] <jak2000> localStorage.setItem('myTable_'+xrenglon, $("#myTablePesoProd_"+xrenglon).html());
[17:56:15] <jak2000> with <table id='#myTablePesoProd_01' class='table table-striped table-bordered table-hover'><thead>....</tfoot></table>  and in localstorage only saved: <thead> .... </tfoot>   not <table></table> part..... why?
[17:56:32] <taplar> html() gets the innerHTML
[17:56:46] <taplar> localStorage.setItem('myTable_'+xrenglon, $("#myTablePesoProd_"+xrenglon).prop('outerHTML'));
[17:57:00] <jak2000> ok
[17:58:28] <jak2000> done
[17:58:44] <taplar> and on that note, i'm heading home, ^_^
[17:59:05] <taplar> hasta luego everyone
[17:59:19] <jak2000> driving?
[18:01:53] <V7> Hey all ;)
[18:02:21] <V7> How it would be the most right way to implement "document.querySelector(this).querySelector('tbody').addEventListener('click', ..." in jQuery ?
[18:02:46] <V7> Is it "$( this ).find( "tbody" ).on( "click", ... " ?
[18:12:34] <robertmaxrees> V7 that's one way.
[18:13:09] <robertmaxrees> V7 though i gotta ask - why are you binding an event listener like that?
[18:13:14] <robertmaxrees> kind of unusual
[18:13:30] <V7> WHat is usual ?
[18:13:52] <V7> Which is usual * ?
[18:14:01] <robertmaxrees> what is that event handler body doing?
[18:16:09] <V7> It gets row of closest tr, checks if it showed and sets it classname
[18:16:27] <robertmaxrees> "closest" tr of what? the clicked td?
[18:16:36] <robertmaxrees> also: why is it $(this)?
[18:17:16] <V7> ... $( this ).find( "tbody" ).on('click', 'td.details-control', function () {
[18:17:22] <V7> Yes the clicked td
[18:17:35] <V7> This is from drawCallback
[18:17:51] <V7> $( this ) I mean
[18:18:12] <robertmaxrees> do you need to access some data from within the callback?
[18:18:41] <robertmaxrees> I'd wonder if that handler wouldn't stack inadvertentlky.
[18:18:45] <robertmaxrees> *inadvertently
[18:19:48] <V7> stack ?
[18:20:11] <V7> robertmaxrees: This callback is from dataTables's call
[18:20:36] <robertmaxrees> right, but do you need the 'this' there?
[18:20:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:20:40] <V7> From $( this ).DataTable({ "drawCallback": ...
[18:20:48] <robertmaxrees> you could be able to bind that listener outside of that callback is what I'm saying.
[18:20:55] <robertmaxrees> iunstead of having to re-bind it every time it runs.
[18:20:55] <V7> Here's an example
[18:20:58] <V7> https://datatables.net/blog/2014-10-02
[18:21:11] <V7> robertmaxrees: I'm generating tables dynamically
[18:21:26] <robertmaxrees> you can still use event delegation in those cases, but okie :)
[18:21:46] <V7> Btw is it possible to bind these handles after creation ?
[18:22:04] <robertmaxrees> "after creating"?
[18:22:10] <V7> I mean after .DataTable({ });
[18:22:23] <V7> "dataTables drawing"
[18:22:40] <V7> I have these id's, but
[18:22:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?  still lost.
[18:22:44] <SkyLeach> hey all.  Can anyone tell me why I can test functions that use $_data(<elem>,<property>) in the scratchpad, but when I run it in the page it says that $._data is undefined?
[18:23:00] <robertmaxrees> V7 anything you put after the datatables init can bind just find.
[18:23:09] <SkyLeach> JQuery._data, sorry
[18:23:12] <robertmaxrees> you could also use a delegated listener on a parent element and have it to the same thing.
[18:23:29] <V7> YOu mean where tables are ?
[18:23:31] <robertmaxrees> SkyLeach can you fiddle up an example?
[18:23:45] <robertmaxrees> V7 I mean the parent element of the table, yeah.
[18:23:57] <robertmaxrees> V7 are you familiar with what $('element'
[18:24:06] <V7> <div id="bar"><table></table><table></table></div> ?
[18:24:20] <robertmaxrees> $('#bar').on('click', 'td', function() {});
[18:24:26] <robertmaxrees> so long as bar exists, that'll work.
[18:24:38] <V7> Yes $( selector ) or jQuery( slector ) or $.( selector )
[18:24:57] <V7> robertmaxrees: What here is #bar ? tr ?
[18:24:57] <robertmaxrees> $.(selector) isn't the same as those.
[18:25:02] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[18:25:07] <robertmaxrees> #bar is <div id="bar">
[18:25:08] <V7> oops
[18:25:12] <V7> oh
[18:25:18] <robertmaxrees> that's an id selector.
[18:25:35] <V7> Yes, but what element could include td ?
[18:25:41] <V7> By deafult I mean
[18:25:50] <V7> So I thought it was tr
[18:26:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:26:05] <robertmaxrees> not sure wha3t you're asking.
[18:26:12] <robertmaxrees> delegated handlers can be on any ancestor.
[18:26:27] <V7> You wrote $('#bar').on('click', 'td', function() {}); so I thought that #bar is <tr id="bar">
[18:26:46] <V7> Because td is after tr
[18:26:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:26:52] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have to be a direct parent.
[18:26:54] <robertmaxrees> just an ancestor.
[18:27:10] <V7> So that's the point
[18:27:15] <V7> THankyou robertmaxrees :)
[18:27:18] <V7> Thank you *
[18:27:35] <robertmaxrees> that's how delegation works - events "bubble up" from an element through all their ancestors.
[18:27:44] <robertmaxrees> save for a few cases.

[18:28:40] <SkyLeach> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/qp4c43v5/2/
[18:29:32] <robertmaxrees> SkyLeach and when you run that in your dev tools it works as expected?
[18:30:13] <SkyLeach> yes
[18:30:31] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you type $.fn.jquery in your console?
[18:30:42] <SkyLeach> docs: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[18:31:03] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating .data and ._data
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[18:31:21] <SkyLeach> .data is actually old IIRC, changed to _data in 1.8
[18:31:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:31:31] <robertmaxrees> it is and always have been .data()
[18:31:35] <SkyLeach> anyhow, same result either way
[18:31:43] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you type $.fn.jquery in your console?
[18:32:17] <V7> "3.2.1"
[18:32:24] <robertmaxrees> that was for SkyLeach heh
[18:32:30] <SkyLeach> $.fn is undefined
[18:32:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> there's your answer.
[18:32:50] <robertmaxrees> if jquery isn't on the page, chrome uses $ as a special shortcut.
[18:32:59] <SkyLeach> not using chrome
[18:33:02] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[18:33:12] <robertmaxrees> FF?
[18:33:15] <V7> Just wanted to зфкешсшзфеу ЖВ
[18:33:19] <SkyLeach> FF 55.0.3
[18:33:21] <V7> oh
[18:33:25] <V7> Just wanted to participate ;)
[18:33:26] <robertmaxrees> SkyLeach yeah, does the same thing.
[18:33:37] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[18:33:57] <SkyLeach> I see... so why is the documented function (JQuery.data) coming up as undefined?
[18:34:00] <robertmaxrees> do console.log($.fn.jquery) in your js.  you'll probably get the same error.
[18:34:05] <robertmaxrees> because you're not loading jquery.
[18:34:06] <V7> SkyLeach: Just connect a jQuery from some cdn
[18:34:07] <SkyLeach> that explains why it works in the console, but not why it doesn't work in jquery
[18:34:18] <SkyLeach> sorry in the page
[18:34:24] <robertmaxrees> or it's getting noConflict run at some point.
[18:34:32] <robertmaxrees> hence my console log suggestion
[18:34:42] <SkyLeach> if you notice in the fiddle, jquery is definitely included
[18:34:52] <robertmaxrees> because ._data is not the method.
[18:35:08] <SkyLeach> https://jsfiddle.net/qp4c43v5/3/ switched it to .data()
[18:35:19] <robertmaxrees> back way upo.
[18:35:26] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[18:35:26] <V7> So here's $_data
[18:35:35] <V7> So here's $._data *
[18:35:51] <SkyLeach> I want to check the functions bound to an event
[18:36:06] <robertmaxrees> SkyLeach why not abstract them out and use jquery for all of them instead?
[18:36:07] <V7> I get [a#func_me]
[18:36:59] <V7> When clicking get SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[18:37:11] <SkyLeach> because I'm writing userscripts.  It's a hell of a lot easier to wrap events in promises if they are extracted than to write a bunch of code to redefine them.
[18:37:23] <V7> o.o
[18:37:35] <robertmaxrees> SkyLeach so you're trying to re-use handlers already on the page?
[18:37:42] <SkyLeach> yup
[18:37:59] <SkyLeach> capture, undefine, wrap, redefine
[18:38:20] <robertmaxrees> that's interesting.
[18:38:26] <SkyLeach> s/define/register
[18:38:52] <robertmaxrees> err, wait - do you actually need the original logic or are you just trying to stop the handler from running?
[18:39:16] <SkyLeach> nah, I don't need any of that.  the function definition bound to the handler is all I need.
[18:39:27] <SkyLeach> I can then pass it to a promise without caring one bit what the function does.
[18:39:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qp4c43v5/4/
[18:39:47] <robertmaxrees> this is a little closer, though that gets you a string.
[18:41:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qp4c43v5/7/
[18:41:32] <robertmaxrees> this'll do what you really want.
[18:41:53] <robertmaxrees> maybe.
[18:41:58] <SkyLeach> no, that's the assignment function
[18:42:07] <SkyLeach> not the function bound to the event.
[18:42:19] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just kicking around ideas :)
[18:43:34] <SkyLeach> doing some more research
[18:43:44] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i'd go native DOM methods for this.
[18:43:49] <SkyLeach> incidentally, when it works you should see a new object logged to console with a property for every event handler bound to the element.
[18:43:49] <robertmaxrees> instead of using jq.
[18:44:02] <SkyLeach> no, this isn't in native js
[18:44:06] <SkyLeach> this is a jquery-only thing
[18:44:12] <SkyLeach> afaik
[18:44:12] <robertmaxrees> back up a little more.
[18:44:20] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the handler bound using onclick?
[18:44:26] <robertmaxrees> or is it bound some other way?
[18:44:43] <SkyLeach> I'm trying to get a list of all functions registered with the event handler
[18:44:54] <robertmaxrees> right, and how are those functions bound?
[18:45:04] <robertmaxrees> jquery's handlers are distinct from native DOM handlers.
[18:45:32] <SkyLeach> not sure tbh
[18:45:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:46:02] <robertmaxrees> so why do you care about what the original handlers are doing?
[18:46:43] <SkyLeach> I'm pretty sure that jquery is working off the DOM event handlers
[18:46:52] <SkyLeach> at any rate, the problem is closures
[18:47:16] <SkyLeach> if I simply attempt to do this on my own, I don't get the same version of the function that may be already bound, things can and probably will break
[18:47:57] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to promisify the original handlers?
[18:49:35] <robertmaxrees> are they doing an async operation or something?
[18:50:57] <SkyLeach> many of them are, yes
[18:51:05] <robertmaxrees> like ajax calls?
[18:51:15] <SkyLeach> ajax and web worker
[18:51:18] <robertmaxrees> and you need data from those ajax calls?
[18:51:57] <SkyLeach> yes in some cases.  In other cases the underlying REST service gives you a temporary block on requests if you make more than 1/sec but some requests take more than a second to complete.
[18:52:15] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[18:52:31] <SkyLeach> right now my hack is with setTimeout at 1 second per ajax call I want to make
[18:52:40] <SkyLeach> but it's really ugly and sometimes breaks
[18:53:06] <SkyLeach> and also I've come across some additional 'love to have' reasons for wrapping event bound functions
[18:53:38] <robertmaxrees> i guess my concern is that the entire exercise seems like it's harder than it needs to be.
[18:54:01] <SkyLeach> robertmaxrees, if I get it worked out, I'll ping you
[18:54:19] <SkyLeach> for now though I'll brb and I wanted to check here if there was something well known I was missing first.
[18:54:28] <SkyLeach> it looks like my problem is evolving anyhow.
[18:54:33] <SkyLeach> https://jsfiddle.net/qp4c43v5/8/
[18:54:41] <SkyLeach> the results of the call is undefined, not the call
[18:54:46] <SkyLeach> so I'm making progress
[18:55:09] <robertmaxrees> you know that .data() doesn't do what you think it does, right?
[18:55:15] <robertmaxrees> it's for data attributes
[18:55:29] <robertmaxrees> .prop()/.attr() are for other data attributes.
[18:55:39] <robertmaxrees> err, *other attributes
[18:57:43] <V7> robertmaxrees: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-contributing-to-jQuery
[18:57:49] <V7> You're on TV :)
[18:58:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:58:16] <robertmaxrees> ig,
[18:58:18] <robertmaxrees> *oh
[18:58:33] <robertmaxrees> cool
[18:58:38] <V7> ;)
[19:09:47] <V7> So ... I have this code: https://hastebin.com/zicotejizo.js
[19:10:28] <V7> As the result I get this: https://i.imgur.com/andapMC.png
[19:10:58] <robertmaxrees> what is "tbl"?
[19:11:09] <V7> var tbl = $( "#" + name ).DataTable({
[19:11:24] <V7> As in their example: https://datatables.net/blog/2014-10-02
[19:12:00] <robertmaxrees> i'ma guess that .DataTable() isn't returning what you think it is.
[19:12:24] <robertmaxrees> that example is chaining off jquery selectors, not the datatables init
[19:12:49] <V7> You mean this ?
[19:12:58] <V7> $( this ) ?
[19:13:12] <robertmaxrees> i mean tbl
[19:13:44] <V7> Hmm ... They have var table = $('#example').DataTable( {
[19:14:00] <V7> You mean that tbl is not table here ?
[19:14:07] <robertmaxrees> on https://datatables.net/blog/2014-10-02#Starting-point ?
[19:14:11] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[19:14:18] <V7> Yes yes
[19:14:29] <robertmaxrees> it's suuuuper hard to debug using a screenshot of an error and a small snippet of code that has missing bits.
[19:14:33] <V7> Here's some var row = table.row( tr );
[19:14:33] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle?
[19:14:42] <V7> I'll try
[19:14:42] <mjones> So I'm calling a function that I defined like this: $(window).on('load', function () { myFunction(); }); This works in firefox, but not chrome. Anyone know why this might be? In chrome no error is shown in the log, it just appears like the function is never called...
[19:15:06] <robertmaxrees> mjones the load event could have fired before that handler was bound.
[19:15:12] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you're using window load?
[19:15:47] <mjones> Hmm. The function depends on the Facebook SDK being loaded and initialized.
[19:16:30] <robertmaxrees> what's the facebook recommendation for implementing?
[19:16:58] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart, right?
[19:20:18] <mjones> Right, so I have that code included in a JS file. And the function I would like to call after that is a slightly modified version of this: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.getLoginStatus/
[19:20:54] <mjones> Which I have defined in a seperate JS file
[19:22:16] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/advanced-setup#onload
[19:24:31] <mjones> Damn. Good find. Let me try that out
[19:25:07] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:29:23] <mjones> robertmaxrees: works like a charm. Still not sure what the issue was though... Maybe you were right about the handler not being bound
[19:32:21] <robertmaxrees> can be all kinds of things./
[20:12:49] <jak2000> hi all
[20:15:54] <jak2000> strange i generate a table: $("#myTablePesoProd_"+xrenglon)  with jsp, and with js, after after was displayed and user changed values.... save:  localStorage.setItem('myTable_'+xrenglon, $("#myTablePesoProd_"+xrenglon).prop('outerHTML'));  i check the localstorage value of this table and i see the html table code but with initial values, why?
[20:16:08] <jak2000> robertmaxrees friend give me a hand escuse me for ask directly
[20:16:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:16:48] <robertmaxrees> because outerHTML isn't grabbing the current state of the form.
[20:16:52] <robertmaxrees> it's grabbing the markup of the form.
[20:17:15] <robertmaxrees> setting aside the nitty gritty there - why are you storing all of that markup?>
[20:17:27] <V7> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/94wgwqsb/17/
[20:17:37] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[20:17:57] <V7> As you see + button will work if "drawCallback" is commented
[20:18:04] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:18:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:18:26] <robertmaxrees> sooooo....
[20:18:32] <robertmaxrees> why a3re you bulding this using native dom methods?
[20:18:47] <jak2000> because
[20:19:30] <jak2000> i have in  row some, inputs, and 1 of them is a button that say a html table.... then when user... close the modal form and want going again to see wich values captured i want show again...
[20:19:50] <jak2000> how to fix my problem? ajax?
[20:19:51] <V7> I\ve tried before to create table with jQuery, but DataTables didn't see these tables, but JS generated saw
[20:19:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 uh
[20:20:01] <jak2000> understand?
[20:20:07] <jak2000> i am explained? :)
[20:20:17] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 ajax isn't going to change anything - outerHTML is the issue.
[20:20:28] <robertmaxrees> you really need to store an state object.
[20:20:31] <robertmaxrees> *a
[20:20:34] <jak2000> yes how  to?
[20:20:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you can .map() over the inputs and get an array of name: value objects.
[20:21:07] <robertmaxrees> V7 you need a templating engine instead.
[20:21:11] <robertmaxrees> or just write htmk.
[20:21:13] <jak2000> uh........
[20:21:15] <robertmaxrees> *html
[20:21:30] <V7> For what ?
[20:21:43] <robertmaxrees> V7 for the table.
[20:21:50] <V7> Why ?
[20:22:03] <robertmaxrees> because what you have now is super hard to read and reason about.
[20:22:13] <V7> Oh you're about an example ?
[20:22:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:22:21] <robertmaxrees> i'
[20:22:26] <robertmaxrees> *i'm talking about your fiddle.
[20:23:44] <robertmaxrees> eitrher way.
[20:23:50] <jak2000> ok then is better save with ajax on a temptable..... not?
[20:24:07] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 never store html.
[20:24:12] <robertmaxrees> html is not data.
[20:24:26] <robertmaxrees> v7 my point about var tbl = $("#" + name).DataTable({ still stands.
[20:24:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't think that returns what you think it returns.
[20:25:09] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes understand .... but inplace of use localstorage for save an html table i can use ajax for save my data in a temptable...
[20:25:10] <jak2000> ok thanks
[20:25:15] <jak2000> thanks
[20:25:30] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that choice depends on a variety of factors.

[20:32:51] <Chill-Surf> Hi there, I am struggling to store a number which i am able to print in the console log but not in the browser printed data. all i need is in line 15 and 32
[20:32:54] <Chill-Surf> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NaBWKR?editors=1111
[20:34:23] <robertmaxrees> Chill-Surf looks like that ping method is async.
[20:34:27] <Chill-Surf> you can easily see from the link that the console prints the response time for each individual website correctly but in the browser you can see only the last result being shown for all sites
[20:34:46] <Chill-Surf> whats async?
[20:34:50] <robertmaxrees> asynchronous.
[20:35:35] <Chill-Surf> all i need is in line 15 for the "text2" vaiable to be stored correctly. you can see in line 14 that i print delta correctly
[20:35:42] <robertmaxrees> that's noit going to be possible.
[20:35:53] <robertmaxrees> anyting that relies on that var must be within the .then() callback.
[20:36:35] <Chill-Surf> robertmaxrees thanks for helping me out
[20:36:41] <robertmaxrees> sure
[20:36:50] <Chill-Surf> how am i able to store it correctly to another global variable?
[20:37:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:37:03] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[20:37:19] <robertmaxrees> ping is asynchronous - when that fires, the code doesn't stop.
[20:37:26] <robertmaxrees> it keeps going.  it doesn't wait for ping to finish.
[20:37:39] <Chill-Surf> how am i able to make it synchronous?
[20:37:56] <robertmaxrees> you're already storing that value globally, but that code may or may not finish by the time your code in the intrerval runs.
[20:38:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to make it synchronous because that would lock the page.
[20:38:38] <robertmaxrees> you want your code in the .then() cakkbacj,.
[20:38:42] <robertmaxrees> *callback
[20:39:07] <Chill-Surf> when i add it there i get the time (text2) corrrectly but not text1 and text3
[20:39:14] <Chill-Surf> just a moment to show you
[20:41:17] <Chill-Surf> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/KXBKdq?editors=1111
[20:41:27] <Chill-Surf> robertmaxrees check it out please
[20:41:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:41:37] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yzqLYz?editors=1111
[20:41:39] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[20:41:45] <robertmaxrees> kind of.
[20:42:39] <robertmaxrees> but let's back up.
[20:42:39] <V7> robertmaxrees: I've modified their script on page https://datatables.net/blog/2014-10-02 to show what is in "table" variable: so it returned: P {context: Array(1), selector: {…}, tables: ƒ, table: ƒ, draw: ƒ, …} ... made this at fiddle and got: s {context: Array(1), selector: {…}, tables: ƒ, table: ƒ, draw: ƒ, …}
[20:42:44] <robertmaxrees> what's your end goal here, Chill-Surf
[20:43:09] <robertmaxrees> V7 the way you modified the code means it works differently than the version on that page.
[20:43:13] <Chill-Surf> i need to ping some servers or sites
[20:43:26] <Chill-Surf> andbe able to see the time and server correctly
[20:43:27] <V7> I've just added sconole.log
[20:43:31] <V7> console *
[20:43:37] <robertmaxrees> V7 your code did more than that.
[20:43:55] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm not looking at the same thing...
[20:44:04] <robertmaxrees> which section on that page are you talking about?
[20:44:08] <robertmaxrees> Chill-Surf okay.
[20:44:09] <V7> This's userscript: https://hastebin.com/pixenireze.js
[20:44:21] <robertmaxrees> V7 right - that's how yopu should do it.
[20:44:31] <robertmaxrees> notice out the event binding it outside of the datatable init?
[20:45:07] <robertmaxrees> Chill-Surf so you want to ping 1 site every 5 seconds?
[20:45:17] <robertmaxrees> or all three sites every 5 seconds?
[20:46:04] <Chill-Surf> no every minute
[20:46:09] <Chill-Surf> or 3minutes
[20:46:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[20:46:22] <Chill-Surf> i have it set to 5seconds jsut for testing
[20:46:33] <robertmaxrees> every n period of time ;)
[20:46:54] <V7> robertmaxrees: oh
[20:46:56] <V7> https://i.imgur.com/yV4KbQd.png
[20:47:17] <V7> This gave me this: https://hastebin.com/sobamexeqa.js
[20:47:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:47:33] <V7> So ... "drawCallback": function( settings ) { can't get table at the start
[20:47:42] <robertmaxrees> sure it can.
[20:47:47] <V7> undefined
[20:47:48] <robertmaxrees> just not the initialized one.
[20:47:50] <V7> Isn't it ?
[20:48:22] <robertmaxrees> lol this is why i kept saying you want your code in a delegated handler outside of the init
[20:48:44] <robertmaxrees> Chill-Surf so... where do you think you're going wrong? :)
[20:49:02] <Chill-Surf> you fixed me what i wanted
[20:49:03] <V7> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to see it
[20:49:05] <Chill-Surf> thanks a lot!
[20:49:22] <robertmaxrees> Chill-Surf def.
[20:49:28] <robertmaxrees> fyi
[20:49:36] <robertmaxrees> don't use document.write

[20:50:20] <Chill-Surf> i need to use documend append and create element
[20:50:26] <Chill-Surf> i found earlier today
[20:50:32] <Chill-Surf> thats my first javascript code
[20:50:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:50:34] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[20:51:31] <V7> robertmaxrees: Okay
[20:51:38] <V7> I see and thank you ;)
[20:51:41] <robertmaxrees> V7 def
[20:51:50] <V7> But I get the same: Cannot read property '_detailsShow' of undefined
[20:51:52] <V7> :D
[20:52:19] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:52:28] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[20:52:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:55:59] <V7> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/94wgwqsb/24/
[20:56:18] <V7> Btw on this fiddle it just doesn't show details
[20:56:42] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue you're having?
[20:57:10] <V7> In main: Cannot read property '_detailsShow' of undefined, in fiddle: details are not shown
[20:57:35] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:57:43] <robertmaxrees> so then your fiddle is different from your site?
[20:57:59] <V7> Yes I'm generating tables
[20:58:16] <V7> This jsut html one
[20:58:20] <V7> (fiddle)
[20:58:29] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:58:46] <V7> yeah ... I know ...
[20:58:55] <robertmaxrees> and you just want to hide/show rows?
[20:59:05] <V7> SlideDown
[20:59:17] <V7> But yup hide/shiw in general
[20:59:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/94wgwqsb/26/
[20:59:53] <robertmaxrees> so this works
[20:59:59] <robertmaxrees> hopied from https://datatables.net/examples/server_side/row_details.html
[21:00:04] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[21:00:07] <robertmaxrees> anyway, gotta jet.
[21:00:09] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeee
[21:00:13] <ashzade> Hey everyone. I need help solving a problem that I've spent at least 10 hours on that I feel is basic. I have a form that loads with 10 fields and then through ajax has additional fields added to it. I need my code to act on the field on page load and on any new elements added.
[21:00:49] <ashzade> I have my code wrapped in one function that I run on dom.ready. this doesn't work on elements added via ajax.
[21:01:11] <V7> Thank you very much !!
[21:01:21] <V7> I'll try to make something from this one
[21:01:22] <Chill-Surf> robertmaxrees thanks again for all your help!

[21:31:21] <V7> https://jsfiddle.net/94wgwqsb/28/
[21:31:37] <V7> Why tr doesn't SlideDown and SlideUp ?
[21:32:22] <V7> And console.log( $( "td.details-control" ) ); says [prevObject: r.fn.init(1)], but selector tbl.on('click', 'tr td.details-control', function() { works somehow ...
[21:35:00] <V7> Anyone ?
[21:44:06] <wa5ted> heyooo people
[21:44:21] <wa5ted> anyone from ye old here?
