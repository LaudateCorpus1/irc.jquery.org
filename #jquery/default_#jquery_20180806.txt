[02:31:08] <Jonno_FTW> cdnjs and jsdelivr have different versions of latest jquery.min.js, 3.3.1 and 3.2.1 respectively
[07:29:43] <stennowork> good day, i have a strange problem with jquery. on document. ready, a function creates certain elements wrapping around a checkbox, and an onclick handler written to that wrapper element. in the handler, after executing the rest of the callback, the .click event of the checkbox gets called with the_checkbox.click()
[07:30:18] <stennowork> in that callback, the_checkbox.prop("click", true); is set
[07:30:53] <stennowork> err
[07:31:05] <stennowork> the_checkbox.prop("checked", true)
[07:31:44] <stennowork> now in another callback, that is bound to click on the checkbox itself, i found that the checked prop of the checkbox is still false, even though it got set in the wrapper callback earlier
[07:31:48] <stennowork> how can that be?
[07:32:28] <stennowork> i do .preventdefault and .stoppropagation in the checkbox click callback
[07:33:42] <stennowork> it's basically, if (somecondition) { the_checkbox.prop("checked", true); the_checkbox.click(); } in the wrapper function
[07:34:27] <stennowork> idk how to even debug this.
[07:36:01] <stennowork> how can the prop of the checkbox be set to true but in the onclick event be false?
[07:36:18] <stennowork> even though it has been explicitely set to true
[07:43:57] <stennowork> here is a jsfiddle of the problem: you see that the console.log in the click handler will output false, even though outputting true is expected
[07:43:58] <stennowork> https://jsfiddle.net/rs6nc3q2/5/
[07:46:33] <stennowork> and you can see in the rendered markup that the checkbox actually gets checked
[07:46:45] <stennowork> but in the triggered callback its still false
[07:49:20] <stennowork> you will also see that the `this` is correctly the checkbox
[07:49:32] <stennowork> yet the value isn't updated there yet and i have no idea why that would be
[07:49:49] <stennowork> any help or insight regarding that would be apprechiated
[08:00:49] <stennowork> apparently this is a vanilla javascript problem, i will ask there
[08:11:47] <anli> How to I decide which iframe that should receive keystrokes?
[08:20:09] <Woet> anli: what is your jQuery question?
[08:20:56] <anli> It seems like it became (how do I make a frame input keyboard strokes), which I managed to do inside the frames script with window.focus();
[08:21:06] <anli> So jQuery was not needed
[09:59:46] <elit3x_> Trying to make an ajax call to sendgrid - getting  Cross-Origin Request Blocked -- https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contacts-api-recipients/add-recipients  -- Does anyone have any experience with the sendgrid API?
[10:22:36] <pavonia> elit3x_: https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/API/cors.html
[10:24:09] <elit3x_> pavonia,I did see that, but i am confused. To me it seamed that the issue that page was explaining was specific to sending email... If you are not allowed to use the API from web browsers why do they provide examples in API docs for javascrip / jquery?
[10:25:40] <pavonia> What examples?
[10:29:05] <elit3x_> pavonia, https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contacts-api-recipients/add-recipients --> Click try it out --> Code Generation --> Javascript
[10:30:31] <pavonia> Hhm, weird
[10:32:24] <hollusion> why does $element.data('something') automatically convert to json but NOT type cast boolean?
[10:32:40] <hollusion> *automatically parse json
[10:34:46] <taplar> hollusion: example?
[10:35:21] <hollusion> ill try to reproduce
[10:35:35] <taplar> i know it converts lots of things
[10:36:03] <hollusion> hmmmmmmm strange
[10:36:11] <hollusion> JSON.parse('{"test": "false"}')
[10:36:18] <hollusion> i tried this in dev console
[10:36:21] <taplar> because of the "" around the false
[10:36:25] <taplar> it's a string
[10:36:34] <stennowork> ^
[10:36:43] <hollusion> well then check this JSON.parse("false")
[10:36:45] <stennowork> try '{"test":false}' instead
[10:36:53] <taplar> "false" isn't valid json
[10:37:04] <shoky> isn't it?
[10:37:14] <taplar> hmm
[10:37:19] <stennowork> works for me, its false
[10:37:20] <taplar> i thought json had to be in {} or [] ?
[10:37:23] <stennowork> as expected
[10:37:24] <shoky> but "false" has no quotes around the word false
[10:37:25] <stennowork> nah
[10:37:28] <shoky> inside the string
[10:37:31] <stennowork> right
[10:37:36] <stennowork> it'd have to be '"false"'
[10:37:39] <shoky> ^
[10:37:41] <stennowork> for it to be parsed as string
[10:37:52] <shoky> taplar: nope
[10:38:03] <taplar> huh, guess i've never had lose json like that
[10:38:44] <stennowork> i think it was planned like that at some point but then crockford decided otherwise for some reason
[10:39:38] <taplar> part of me almost started to argue "but it's a string, not an object"... but there all objects, >_<
[10:40:05] <shoky> not in JSON :p
[10:40:13] <stennowork> in json, everything is a string
[10:40:18] <shoky> no..
[10:40:27] <stennowork> json is a string
[10:40:33] <stennowork> thats what i meant
[10:40:46] <shoky> right
[10:40:49] <stennowork> if you serialize to json, the result will be a string
[10:41:13] <taplar> which is an object
[10:41:18] <taplar> a String object
[10:41:29] <shoky> my point was,  in JSON,  a string is not an object
[10:41:37] <shoky> (only in JS)
[10:41:44] <taplar> yeah, i'm talking about js
[10:42:07] <stennowork> are primitives even objects in js
[10:42:20] <taplar> numbers are Number's
[10:42:21] <stennowork> they have object-like properties at least
[10:42:41] <taplar> afaik, everything is build on top of the Object class
[10:42:42] <stennowork> a number has typeof "number"
[10:43:00] <stennowork> if you do new Number(23); then typeof is object
[10:43:09] <stennowork> but you can do 2..toString() for example
[10:43:36] <shoky> null and undefined have no object wrappers :p
[10:43:50] <stennowork> isn't typeof null 'object' actually
[10:44:07] <stennowork> yeah it def. doesn't go the ruby way
[10:44:11] <shoky> yea
[10:44:20] <taplar> mmm, too much serious conversation for a monday
[10:44:27] <stennowork> ruby is a bit too insane in that regard
[10:44:57] <stennowork> Class.class == Class
[10:51:13] <fgasper> Hi all. Question: Why does .getScript() create DOM to parse the JS? Why not use Function()?
[10:54:22] <taplar> dunno the answer to that one
[10:57:27] <fgasper> Ah, there’s a comment that I didn’t see earlier:
[10:57:29] <fgasper> / Use native DOM manipulation to avoid our domManip AJAX trickery
[10:58:05] <fgasper> … whatever that means …
[10:58:22] <pavonia> How would you do it with Function()?
[10:58:51] <fgasper> Function(js)()
[10:59:25] <fgasper> (“js” being the JS source as a string)
[11:01:03] <taplar> i'm curious, if you do an eval() does the logic have access to local variables?
[11:01:14] <fgasper> eval(), yes; Function(), no
[11:01:30] <fgasper> There’s a discussion of it here:
[11:01:31] <fgasper> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
[11:03:33] <fgasper> Looks like that has just always used DOM …
[11:04:04] <hollusion> it seems like GET rquests are messing with json
[11:04:12] <taplar> yeah, I dunno if there was consideration for that specifically.  more of a developer question, possibly
[11:04:21] <hollusion> if i send json via POST the booleans stay booleans
[11:04:28] <hollusion> if i do it via GET they become strings
[11:06:20] <taplar> hollusion: example?
[11:12:06] <hollusion> i believe its a node express issue
[11:12:19] <hollusion> ill ask over there for advice first, thank you
[11:12:41] <taplar> you could check the network console of the request to see how it is being returned on the requests
[11:12:48] <taplar> look for differences
[11:15:37] <shoky> hollusion: make sure to set content-type header on the request, and that you're actually sending a JSON string (for the ajax 'data') and not a JS object. you probably need to use JSON.stringify()
[11:16:24] <hollusion> $.get(url, data, function (res) {
[11:16:36] <hollusion> shouldnt passing an object as data handle everyting by itself?
[11:16:58] <taplar> if you give get an object it will turn it into a query string
[11:17:03] <taplar> it won't be json at that point
[11:17:11] <hollusion> i see
[11:17:26] <taplar> same thing with post though
[11:17:46] <shoky> jquery doesn't do anything do help you send json requests
[11:17:48] <taplar> you have to do what shoky said to send actual json
[11:17:49] <shoky> to*
[11:18:08] <taplar> but sending real json in a get request is kinda strange
[11:18:17] <taplar> imho
[11:18:28] <shoky> yep
[13:07:23] <royalty> I'm having trouble editing data attributes of a cloned element
[13:07:27] <royalty> I'm doing a deep clone
[13:07:40] <royalty> hmmm
[13:07:48] <royalty> maybe i just shouldn't do a deep clone
[13:07:50] <royalty> let me see
[13:08:09] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[13:08:13] <robertmaxrees> but how are you editing them?
[13:10:00] <royalty> this will take a while to mock up lol
[13:10:07] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> so how are you editing them?
[13:10:14] <royalty> i'm using .data('option', newvalue)
[13:10:22] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's breaking?
[13:10:52] <royalty> basically when i actually click on the checkbox (i'm editing the data for) I have a console.log on click for the data and it's spitting out the old value
[13:11:01] <royalty> not the new value i set in the clone
[13:11:05] <royalty> and this is the clone
[13:11:23] <royalty> this is probably hard to visualize
[13:12:17] <royalty> so to keep it brief I have an element I'm cloning like let promoCode = $('#promo-form-copy .promo-code').clone(true);
[13:12:32] <royalty> hmmm
[13:12:40] <royalty> let me try something before I continue
[13:13:12] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting the data?
[13:13:37] <royalty> data is already attached, so I just want to change one character in the data
[13:13:46] <robertmaxrees> so how are you getting the data back out?
[13:13:55] <royalty> oh
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> are you using .data() for that or some other means?
[13:14:01] <royalty> I append the cloned element in the dom
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> and then how do you pull the data back out.
[13:14:19] <royalty> promoCode.find('#seasonpromocodes-0-restrict-usage').data('toggle-option', '#usage-restrictions-' + promoCodes.count);
[13:14:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> #seasonpromocodes
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> -0-restrict-usage
[13:14:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad sign.
[13:14:43] <royalty> so this is the cloned element
[13:14:43] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating IDs on your page.
[13:14:50] <royalty> well no i'm not actually
[13:14:55] <royalty> i update the cloned element before i append
[13:15:05] <robertmaxrees> something is amiss then.
[13:15:06] <royalty> using attr();
[13:15:11] <royalty> yeah, lol
[13:15:42] <robertmaxrees> clkoning elements with IDs is a generally bad idea fwiw.
[13:15:46] <royalty> I'm basically copying a form in order to get add extra promo code or remove extra promo code
[13:16:13] <royalty> so when a user clicks add promo code
[13:16:20] <royalty> it copies a hidden promo code form
[13:16:40] <royalty> then i change all the id's/name data of the inputs to work like I want
[13:16:57] <royalty> then I have to worry about the toggle functionality I have going on some checkboxes/inputs
[13:17:06] <royalty> so far the id's/naming are getting updated fine
[13:17:25] <royalty> the toggle functionality is uhhh, reliant on that data attribute being correct
[13:17:33] <royalty> I've done something similar before
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> i'
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> *i'd bet part of your issue is the handlers are directly bound to the wrong elements or something similar.
[13:18:24] <royalty> well maybe, but another part is that the data is not properly being over-ridden as far as i could tell, i'll mess around a bit
[13:19:16] <royalty> let me see if i can recreate my problem in a jslint
[13:19:29] <royalty> with only the appending/data going on
[13:19:42] <royalty> jsfiddle i mean
[13:28:35] <royalty> yeah
[13:28:38] <royalty> i was able to recreate it
[13:28:39] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/1brqzyd3/9/
[13:28:55] <royalty> so after you add the input then click on it, the data value is showing the old value
[13:29:10] <royalty> but in the clone it shows the new value, before it's appended
[13:29:42] <royalty> I didn't bother changing the name of the input
[13:29:50] <royalty> but that's working on my version anyway
[13:31:30] <taplar> i'm confused, this seems to work
[13:32:05] <how2hack> i'm curious, why was toggle(function(){}, function(){}) removed?
[13:32:29] <royalty> taplar, if you click on it after it's appended
[13:32:37] <royalty> you'll see the old data
[13:32:52] <taplar> i'm seeing the new data
[13:33:13] <taplar> you realize that the new elements are appearing above the original, right?
[13:33:14] <royalty> lol hold on
[13:33:17] <royalty> i could be getting confused
[13:33:19] <royalty> hahaha
[13:33:24] <royalty> yeah give me a sec
[13:33:40] <royalty> ugh
[13:33:42] <royalty> yeah it's working
[13:33:42] <royalty> lol
[13:33:51] <royalty> i must be doing something wrong in mine then
[13:34:24] <royalty> it seems you could do it with .attr but also with .data?
[13:34:52] <taplar> attr() is the general purpose method.  data() is specific for data attributes
[13:35:10] <royalty> yeah, probably wouldn't make a difference which one i used
[13:35:17] <royalty> well
[13:35:24] <taplar> there are also some other differences between the two
[13:35:36] <taplar> data() will do some caching and also type conversions
[13:35:48] <taplar> attr(), afaik, expects the values to be strings only
[13:37:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:38:36] <royalty> ok
[13:41:31] <royalty> it probably has something to do with that i'm finding it by it's id
[13:41:36] <royalty> changing the data
[13:41:40] <royalty> then i'm changing it's id
[13:42:01] <royalty> maybe if i did that in the example it would break like i expect
[13:42:22] <royalty> i'll try changing it in a bit
[13:49:48] <how2hack> how can i check if data-x is set? strict comparison against undefined?
[13:50:53] <robertmaxrees> .data('x') == null
[13:51:03] <robertmaxrees> or just !$('.foo').data('x');
[13:51:14] <how2hack> ty
[14:19:49] <royalty> I think some other js might be interfering or something
[14:20:06] <royalty> doing a boiled down example it seems to be working
[14:20:15] <royalty> of my exact html/js
[14:20:16] <royalty> damn
[14:31:19] <royalty> could it be i'm using an older version of jquery?
[14:31:37] <royalty> I suppose I could test that pretty easily
[14:31:40] <robertmaxrees> what version are you using?
[14:31:46] <royalty> checking now
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> you can go to your console and enter $.fn.jquery
[14:32:17] <robertmaxrees> that'll telkl you.
[14:32:21] <robertmaxrees> *tell
[14:32:36] <royalty> 2.1.4
[14:33:22] <royalty> ugh that didn't make a difference in my fiddle
[14:35:28] <royalty> how can it be working exactly in an example
[14:35:40] <royalty> and failing on my dev env
[14:35:46] <robertmaxrees> what makes the example different?
[14:35:56] <royalty> less html
[14:35:57] <royalty> lol
[14:36:18] <royalty> but how would this affect a data-attribute
[14:36:20] <royalty> not being set
[14:36:32] <royalty> i'm going to copy paste the js from the example just in case
[14:36:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the case that's failing. my guess is you have a much more fundamental issue going on.
[14:37:18] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/64t0ks7p/11/
[14:37:26] <royalty> this is almost exactly like the real deal
[14:37:34] <royalty> it's working
[14:37:49] <royalty> if you keep adding promos and click restrict usage on each
[14:38:06] <royalty> it opens/closes the correct thing, that means the data- attributes are getting updated for sure
[14:38:15] <royalty> even on jquery 2.1.3
[14:43:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:45:31] <royalty> I'm checking every script that's being added now and removing it
[14:48:18] <taplar> it's like finding waldo
[14:49:13] <royalty> i know, right
[15:04:44] <royalty> every script is removed except jquery
[15:04:54] <royalty> and my code that's the exact code from the example
[15:04:59] <royalty> and my local it still won't work
[15:05:25] <royalty> maybe i need document ready wrappers
[15:06:11] <taplar> have you ever done a join.me ?
[15:06:32] <taplar> you've gotten me curious as to what you are doing/seeing
[15:06:38] <royalty> lol
[15:06:44] <royalty> i've never done that
[15:06:51] <royalty> give me a second, i want to try on dom ready
[15:06:52] <royalty> first
[15:06:59] <royalty> i have a feeling it's a really stupid problem
[15:07:36] <taplar> meh, looks like join.me requires an account registration now.  lame
[15:08:54] <royalty> damn that didn't work
[15:10:41] <royalty> i really don't understand how my js lint is working and my dev isn't at this point
[15:11:16] <royalty> I'm going to grab a coffee/eat a snack
[15:16:18] <how2hack> hmmm isn't self.data('sortby', 'desc') supposed to set the elemnt attribute "data-sortby" to "desc"?
[15:16:59] <royalty> what is self? isn't it supposed to be $(this)?
[15:17:09] <how2hack> yes: self = $(this)
[15:17:26] <royalty> then yes it is
[15:17:38] <how2hack> i wonder why it isn't working...
[15:17:39] <royalty> but you won't see it update in the html
[15:17:54] <royalty> but when you actually check the data of the element it's there
[15:17:58] <royalty> so it can be tricky like that
[15:18:22] <how2hack> i don't need it in the dom, i need it to check else if (self.data('sortby') === 'desc')
[15:18:45] <how2hack> it's never executing that else if
[15:19:55] <shoky> then check why
[15:20:02] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/Lmnr5dk1/
[15:20:51] <shoky> you never set it to anything in this code
[15:21:18] <how2hack> isn't line 10 setting it?
[15:21:29] <shoky> line 10 will never get executed?
[15:22:11] <shoky> nor will 14
[15:22:11] <how2hack> why not? everytime i click the span i can see the console.log('asc')
[15:22:24] <shoky> they are in an 'if' which is false..
[15:22:35] <shoky> (unless you've set the data to something somewhere else)
[15:22:53] <how2hack> by default sortby is 'asc'
[15:23:06] <shoky> then line 10 sets it to 'desc' :p
[15:23:37] <how2hack> then something else must be resetting it to 'asc'...
[15:23:51] <shoky> or it's not the same element you've set it on
[15:24:39] <how2hack> hmm i'm clicking the same span, and i'm always seeing the console.log('asc')
[15:25:10] <shoky> make a working fiddle
[15:25:12] <shoky> showing the problem
[15:26:40] <how2hack> it's working fine on jsfiddle :P
[15:26:56] <shoky> maybe LoadHomeList  or something else replaces that whole DOM structure?
[15:27:08] <shoky> so it's not really the same span anymore
[15:27:59] <how2hack> that's exactly it, it's recreating the html based on the new json data
[15:28:30] <how2hack> without saving the sorting
[15:28:35] <shoky> prolly shouldn't recreate the header columns :p
[15:29:23] <how2hack> hmm actually it's not
[15:29:39] <shoky> or otherwise, save the sorting elsewhere, not on replaced elements
[15:30:12] <how2hack> i'm checking to make sure, and LoadHomeList does not recreate the header columns
[15:32:07] <how2hack> ok it's another function that reloads the whole html
[15:32:26] <shoky> fun
[15:47:42] <how2hack> so i have to load just the new html, it's an ul, between header and footer, how can i replace the one in the dom with the one in memory?
[15:48:33] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[15:50:27] <how2hack> ofc... i'm thick today
[16:41:11] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:41:27] <taplar> evening
[16:51:46] <how2hack> what's the best way to unset the data attribute? .data('sortby', '') or .data('sortby', null)? does it matter?
[16:52:06] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[17:34:11] <royalty> guys
[17:34:23] <royalty> my problem was that i didn't bother to change the label for values
[17:34:30] <royalty> i had no idea that was a thing....
[17:34:40] <royalty> how the hell
[17:34:47] <royalty> did that have anything to do with what i was doing
[17:34:55] <robertmaxrees> labels?
[17:35:01] <royalty> yeah the for="" value
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[17:35:09] <robertmaxrees> tied to the input.
[17:35:13] <royalty> since when
[17:35:18] <robertmaxrees> forever.
[17:35:20] <taplar> 4eva
[17:35:23] <royalty> I didn't get the news apparently
[17:35:31] <robertmaxrees> since forms have beenm a thing afaik
[17:35:44] <taplar> it allows you to click the text and focus to be put on the input
[17:35:47] <royalty> that is quite evil
[17:36:08] <taplar> also fancy shmancy checkbox styling
[17:36:11] <royalty> evil that i didn't know
[17:36:35] <robertmaxrees> you can also skip the for attribute and just wrap the label around the input.
[17:40:08] <how2hack> can i put a parent() inside not()?
[17:40:21] <taplar> what are you trying ot test?
[17:41:04] <how2hack> i want to addClass() only if this parent doesn't have x class
[17:41:32] <taplar> "this parent" is an odd phrase
[17:41:48] <taplar> if the parent of the element does not have the class?
[17:41:55] <how2hack> yes
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> !$(this).parent().hasClass('foo');
[17:42:02] <taplar> yeah, don't put that in not()
[17:42:06] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[17:42:11] <robertmaxrees> gross selectors
[17:44:29] <how2hack> so it is not possible to do it without the if? in one line i mean
[17:44:56] <taplar> you're having to do a traversal to perform the conditional.  it's not a simple selector
[17:45:05] <taplar> and selectors typically only go down
[17:45:53] <how2hack> i was asking to put it inside to do something like: self.not(self.parent('li.coin-profile')).addClass('desc')
[17:46:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no.
[17:46:09] <robertmaxrees> self.net is weird also
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[17:46:14] <taplar> you could do a method and do it like that, but it's not as readable
[17:46:53] <how2hack> i have a class that adds an arrow, but i don't want to show that arrow in the header option
[17:47:03] <how2hack> in the first header option*
[17:47:05] <taplar> jqElement.not(function(){ ...something that returns true/false... });
[17:47:36] <taplar> wait, that css class adds the arrow?
[17:48:02] <how2hack> yes a background-image
[17:48:12] <taplar> and by header do you mean to th's?
[17:48:35] <how2hack> yes, but i'm not using a table, just a header with ul and li
[17:48:53] <taplar> can you throw up a quick fiddle?  this sounds like it might could just be a css solution
[17:50:13] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/
[17:50:35] <taplar> and the associated css?
[17:50:50] <how2hack> it is a mess, as i'm also trying to do the first if when the other header options have the data-sortby
[17:50:58] <how2hack> one sec
[17:51:49] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/1/
[17:53:02] <taplar> so the bottom for rules?  is that the logic in question?
[17:53:06] <taplar> *four
[17:53:44] <taplar> or 60 and 61?
[17:53:49] <how2hack> what's that?
[17:54:08] <taplar> which css rules are putting your arrows you want to not show on the header
[17:54:18] <how2hack> oh
[17:54:40] <how2hack> yes 60 and 61
[17:55:13] <taplar> ok, so right now you are specifically saying to do that.  what is the condition you want that not to work on?
[17:55:33] <taplar> .coin-profile
[17:56:02] <how2hack> li.coin-profile > span should not have the desc arrow
[17:56:34] <taplar> you should be able to modify those rules like so: article#coin-ranking > header > ul > li:not(.coin-profile)
[17:57:26] <taplar> or optionally do something like: article#coin-ranking > header > ul > li:not(.no-sort)
[17:57:31] <taplar> and then just put that class on whatever
[18:07:14] <how2hack> at last... self.parent().not('li.coin-profile').find('span').addClass('desc')... i'm really slow today :(
[18:08:09] <how2hack> but looks like it's easier with css, i just wanted to do it with jquery
[18:57:12] <how2hack> is it possible to toggle variable values?
[18:57:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:58:27] <how2hack> the last problem i have with the sorting script is that, the first column has inverse order from the rest of the columns
[18:58:28] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/2/
[18:58:45] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:58:46] <how2hack> so i use a variable and ternary
[18:59:27] <how2hack> the problem is the if has a || and in this case the variable doesn't have the correct value
[18:59:50] <how2hack> because self.data('sortby') haven't been set yet
[19:00:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:00:04] <how2hack> how can i overcome that problem?
[19:00:11] <robertmaxrees> you've got a lot of global vars here, first of all.
[19:00:23] <how2hack> should i not use var to declare them?
[19:00:27] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[19:00:31] <robertmaxrees> sort = $(this).data('sorton')
[19:00:44] <robertmaxrees> order has a similar problen.
[19:00:48] <how2hack> sort is already declared outside
[19:01:01] <robertmaxrees> outside this click handler? O.o
[19:01:04] <how2hack> they're declared outside, the default values
[19:01:06] <how2hack> yes
[19:01:09] <robertmaxrees> as far as "toggling", you'll have to manually handfle that on your own.
[19:01:41] <how2hack> is there an easy way to get the toggling i'm trying with theOtherWayAround?
[19:02:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.  you'll have to do it manually.
[19:22:50] <how2hack> one last thing (the other was just retarded i don't need any variable for that...)
[19:22:51] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/7/
[19:23:38] <how2hack> why only the second column is setting the variable cond to true when i click it, but the last two dont?
[19:23:40] <robertmaxrees> :| not an ok word buuuut i assume you just mean that it was the wrong solution.,
[19:24:27] <how2hack> i may not be ok, but it's the truth sometimes i'm dumb, instead of seeing how easy it is i complicate it...
[19:24:31] <how2hack> it*
[19:24:32] <robertmaxrees> when you say "second column": you mean the price column?
[19:24:36] <how2hack> yes
[19:25:07] <how2hack> if you click it one time then the first, the if || will be true
[19:25:08] <robertmaxrees> and you're asking about if (self.data('sortby') === 'asc' || (self.parent().hasClass('coin-profile') && cond)) { ?
[19:25:22] <robertmaxrees> clicking it is causing an error for me.
[19:25:36] <how2hack> but if you click the third or fourth column then the first, the if || won't be true
[19:25:58] <how2hack> TypeError: Actions[t.getLast(...)] is undefined?
[19:26:14] <robertmaxrees> getJSON is undefined.
[19:26:24] <robertmaxrees> and self changes each time you click.
[19:26:25] <how2hack> oh i forgot to comment it
[19:27:29] <how2hack> i already took care of that, the second function does not replace all html (including the header), just the ul
[19:27:43] <robertmaxrees> 'self' still changes with each click though.
[19:27:56] <how2hack> i know
[19:28:06] <how2hack> but neither all nor cond use self
[19:28:16] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:28:46] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm not understanding what the issue is then.
[19:28:59] <robertmaxrees> brb
[19:37:55] <how2hack> ok the issue is that when i sort any of the other columns (not the first one), and then i click the first one, i want the if to be executed and not the else
[19:38:53] <how2hack> that's why i put the OR, the problem is that it is only working for the first column, when i sort the last two columns and then click the first one, the if is not getting executed
[19:39:16] <robertmaxrees> have you console logged out those values?
[19:40:00] <how2hack> only the if and else, i'll do the values now
[19:43:17] <how2hack> i don't understand it... it's doing something weird
[19:44:59] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/11/ check it out please
[19:46:07] <how2hack> all.parent().not('li.coin-profile').find('span').data('sortby') this is not working
[19:46:54] <how2hack> the span, self, is getting data-sortby but for some reason the next click it losses the attribute
[19:47:27] <how2hack> doesn't happen with the price column...
[19:54:11] <Phanes> Christel just posted this "denial" on the freenode blog https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake
[19:54:15] <Phanes> This blog is essentially an ad for the Handshake ICO scam with a one-line "denial" of involvement mixed in there. It's obviously very unethical of Christel to not mention her own involvement in the scam which the blog post promotes.
[19:54:19] <Phanes> Consider Andrew Lee's involvement, Andrew Lee is Christel's boss at London Trust Media and he also controls the majority of freenode voting rights. Andrew Lee also heads the handshake ICO scam. Coincidence?
[19:54:22] <Phanes> Oh, and about those donations she speaks of: https://twitter.com/ISCdotORG/status/1025461692132519936
[19:54:26] <Phanes> Don't support freenode and their ICO scam, switch to a network that hasn't been co-opted by corporate interests. OFTC or efnet might be a good choice. Perhaps even https://matrix.org/
[20:04:35] <how2hack> i can't find the problem in the fiddle, you mind checking? https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/15/
[20:04:55] <robertmaxrees> what am I checking?
[20:05:26] <how2hack> first: click second colum then the first one
[20:05:33] <how2hack> second: click third column then the first one
[20:05:50] <how2hack> third or fourth column
[20:05:53] <robertmaxrees> basically, why does the first column retun undefined?
[20:06:15] <how2hack> no, when clicking the first column it returns a string
[20:06:36] <how2hack> that evaluates in the if, but it doesn't happen with the other columns
[20:06:37] <robertmaxrees> "Cryptocurrency" is the first column?
[20:06:39] <how2hack> yes
[20:07:19] <how2hack> and when i said no, i meant yes, i misread
[20:07:42] <robertmaxrees> so self vs all
[20:09:50] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[20:10:06] <how2hack> you see something wrong in the code?
[20:10:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah i dunno.  i'm convinced that all vs self vs isSet is where your headaches are.
[20:10:25] <robertmaxrees> i can't really dig deeper atm tho.
[20:29:49] <how2hack> can anyone help me? why is the last console.log undefined when it shoudnt? https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/su104cqz/18/
[20:50:41] <shoky> how2hack did you find the problem
[21:07:19] <how2hack> shoky not yet
[21:07:45] <how2hack> i must be blind or something
[21:10:21] <shoky> how2hack: sortby/sorton
[21:14:21] <how2hack> ?
[21:14:41] <how2hack> i'm looking at it but i don't see anything wrong
[21:14:50] <shoky> you have sortby in some places, and sorton in others
[21:17:54] <how2hack> sorton is the sort parameter the api accepts, sortby is the order parameter the api accepts
[21:19:03] <how2hack> you think there's the problem?
[21:31:09] <shoky> oh i thought they're the same, nevermind. i'm offto bed, good luck
[22:50:13] <pmercado> Hi, a conceptual front-end question: how is called the way to "click and modify inmediately in backend" as opposite to "changes UI elements and then click save nutton to modify backend" ??? both have been named ?
