[03:27:06] <uskerine> hi, is there any simple solution to translate into two or three languages a static html website?
[03:27:19] <uskerine> javascript is valid too
[04:36:57] <printForever> why does click on a button registers as two clicks?
[04:42:31] <printForever> Hello?
[04:42:49] <printForever> why does <button> fires two events instead of one?
[05:09:20] <Neo_122> which plugin good for hightlight jQuery ?
[05:09:32] <printForever> robertmarxxes CLICK and SUBMIT are NOT the same thing
[05:53:25] <WhirledPress> I am trying to write a plugin that allows any element within a scrollable div to determine it's current "scroll position" and I just don't get how scrolling works. Any suggestions?
[06:42:12] <WhirledPress> as far as I can tell .scrollTop, position, and offset are completely unrelated
[06:56:49] <Arlenx> hi, should i replace all occurrence of [version] with 1.4.5? i'm trying to understand how to use jquery from this link: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/pages/
[06:59:10] <obinoob> hi the closest method search up the chain till parent element right? if so imagine a few nested div how i get the div with class flash https://jsbin.com/kenexoguge/edit?html,output
[07:01:11] <WhirledPress> .closest searches up the chain all the way.... so if you have a class .flash and you have several nested divs. from inside one of the divs you would say $("#nesteddiv").closest(".flash")
[07:02:30] <obinoob> WhirledPress: so $(this).closest('.flash').remove() would remove the parent div ?
[07:02:35] <obinoob> but it doiesn't
[07:02:57] <WhirledPress> that's because $(this) is the document when you bind click to it
[07:02:58] <WhirledPress> $("
[07:03:58] <WhirledPress> wait..
[07:04:29] <WhirledPress> if you say flash.fadeOut(3000).remove(); I don't think it will work.
[07:05:03] <obinoob> $(this) is the button object
[07:09:20] <WhirledPress> does jsbin autosave?
[07:12:40] <WhirledPress> https://jsbin.com/kihagahinu/edit?html,js,console,output
[07:13:30] <WhirledPress> click the test button to check if the .flash element exists. Then click the close window, click test again and it will be gone.
[07:36:58] <obinoob> WhirledPress: so why it wasn't working?
[07:38:16] <obinoob> WhirledPress: I mean the basis is there you basically just changed the way event is bind to the ".close" object
[07:38:32] <WhirledPress> For one thing, you called .fadeOut(300) which I am not sure if that method returns the original jquery object or a promise...
[07:39:27] <WhirledPress> and then you called .remove, but I don't think it chains like that. I think you have to use a callback function to do the remove part
[07:40:58] <WhirledPress> http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/
[07:41:34] <WhirledPress> you'll notice in all the examples, they use the callback function of the fadeout method to remove the element.
[07:42:24] <WhirledPress> but you might have been able to say $(elem).fadeOut(300).done(function () {$(this).remove();});  or something like that.
[07:46:04] <obinoob> WhirledPress: I get that, but I'm console.log($(this).closest('.flash').length) before that block of code (in my computer) and I get 0! and script is being called after html get parsed to dom
[07:46:33] <obinoob> so I'm not sure what's wrong with it but one thing i know I haven't found ;)
[07:47:14] <WhirledPress> so if you click the test button it says found 1, right?
[07:47:36] <WhirledPress> then you click the close button and it fades out and removes itself...
[07:47:51] <WhirledPress> so you click the test button again and it says 0 found, right?
[07:51:40] <WhirledPress> which block of code are you talking about?
[07:57:11] <obinoob> WhirledPress: it says 0 but I've found the reason why either way it should work
[07:57:33] <WhirledPress> what says 0
[07:57:55] <obinoob> WhirledPress: I have two js files that are registering the same event $(document).on('click','.close', function () { ...
[07:58:24] <coolternet> anyone can help me with my function ? https://fkcd.ca/USE
[07:58:48] <obinoob> WhirledPress: so if I change to $('.close').on('click', function () { it works
[08:00:00] <WhirledPress> coolternet, just at first glance, do you mean .data("index") instead of .attr("data-index");?
[08:00:34] <coolternet> data-index is a data-global of my button
[08:01:18] <WhirledPress> and no need to do el.closest("tr").find("#price")...because #price is an ID that can only be used once in your document.
[08:34:44] <coolternet> and here
[08:34:44] <coolternet> http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/9W8qh/
[08:35:02] <coolternet> im trying to sum all price showed in price column
[08:36:43] <obinoob> whats the difference between the two events https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c2193e661ffb36d83df6d873bc92baac
[08:38:22] <obinoob> because only the second event works!!
[08:38:34] <obinoob> can't find a proper answer
[08:39:20] <WhirledPress> try console.log($(this))...I think it will be the document in the first and the close button in the second
[08:39:47] <obinoob> I can only think of good reasons to use event delegation...
[08:39:58] <WhirledPress> coolternet, what's the problem ?
[08:40:15] <WhirledPress> obinoob, what does that mean?
[08:40:22] <coolternet> WhirledPress: http://jsfiddle.net/9W8qh/106/ here
[08:40:51] <WhirledPress> Try it like this: $(document).on("click", function (e) { var $this=$(e.target); ...
[08:41:10] <obinoob> the first example is far better than the second that bubbles up the dom and the capture phase is also worst I guess in the second example
[08:41:11] <WhirledPress> though I would almost never bind to $(document)...
[08:41:40] <WhirledPress> oobinoob, but any number of things can stop the event bubbling
[08:41:55] <obinoob> WhirledPress: I always bind to object
[08:42:13] <WhirledPress> Well, it's not good practice.
[08:42:14] <obinoob> WhirledPress: but this is the first time it is not working
[08:42:20] <obinoob> WhirledPress: not sure why
[08:42:34] <obinoob> WhirledPress: what is not good practice?
[08:44:17] <WhirledPress> coolternet, gimme just a second.
[08:44:48] <WhirledPress> obinoob, binding to document is a lot like .live used to be. It's bad practice because any number of things could intercept the event before it bubbles all the way up.
[08:45:13] <obinoob> WhirledPress: and i guess is the only way you can ensure it is executed for elements that did not exist in the DOM at the time of binding
[08:46:14] <obinoob> WhirledPress: I guess so, but I've searched my code for '.close' and nothing is making use of it...
[08:47:06] <obinoob> WhirledPress: for now i'm trying to understand why it isn't working
[08:58:27] <WhirledPress> coolternet, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/9W8qh/107/
[08:59:29] <WhirledPress> obinoob, but anything up in the hierarchy from .close could be capturing the click event and preventing it from bubbling.
[08:59:37] <coolternet> damn thx !
[09:00:01] <WhirledPress> coolternet, you don't need all those steps, I was just documenting it for you.
[09:00:22] <coolternet> yeah i understand
[09:00:24] <coolternet> thx !
[09:00:27] <WhirledPress> np
[09:03:11] <WhirledPress> obinoob, let's say that I wanted to have a close button on a div that held my nav menu. I might bind a click event handler to the div that returned false--stopping the close button from propogating.
[09:03:25] <WhirledPress> so binding it to document would mean that it would never work.
[10:35:53] <obinoob> WhirledPress: I found out why :D bootstrap was binding to data-dismiss: <button type="button" class="close-flash-box" data-dismiss="alert" aria-hidden="true">Ã—</button>
[10:38:26] <obinoob> WhirledPress: it was quite a lesson... event delegation to document is some serious problem source
[10:39:04] <obinoob> WhirledPress: well I junt wanted to let you know, thank you for your time ;)
[10:46:19] <Duikb00t-home> Im trying to setup 'automatic columns' https://jsfiddle.net/hqxutm6j/
[10:46:26] <Duikb00t-home> i think im almost there but i miss something small?
[10:49:40] <Duikb00t-home> Got it! https://jsfiddle.net/hqxutm6j/2/
[11:13:26] <DelphiWorld> hey guys
[11:13:28] <DelphiWorld> https://dpaste.de/05hK
[11:13:37] <DelphiWorld> why my link click isn't handled here?
[15:39:54] <WhirledPress> if I use  var lnk=$(something); and var others=$(somethingelse), is it okay to say lnk=others.add(lnk)?
[15:45:20] <Buoy172> WhirledPress: yes
[15:45:33] <WhirledPress> thnx
[15:50:27] <WhirledPress> when using bind to bind events, does the event get bound to all elements of the jquery collection or just the collection as a group?
[15:56:31] <WhirledPress> sry. figured out the bind issue. But what is the jquery equiv of elem.offsetParent?
[16:47:40] <WhirledPress> What's the best selector for choosing all decendent elements with defined id attributes? $("source").filter(function () {return $(this).attr("id")!==undefined?$(this):null;} or $("source").find('*['id
[16:56:41] <pavonia> Why not just $("source [id]")?
[17:27:53] <saul> im looking for a dashboard widget set with things like animated graphs, something like a scale or gauge widget perhaps
[17:48:07] <WhirledPress> I need to have two animations happen roughly at the same time--one is pure css, one is jquery .animate...any ideas?
[18:23:23] <babyswizz> I am trying to figure out what is wrong with this code https://paste.pound-python.org/show/lKaAXBSqeZD03LFXQRDe/
[18:23:34] <babyswizz> can anybody help me here?
[18:30:36] <cannap> what is the problem
[18:31:10] <cannap> why bind and not on
[18:35:20] <babyswizz> cannap, well it doesn't send any request
[18:35:49] <cannap> do you see a request in the network tab?
[18:35:55] <cannap> try to change bind to on
[18:39:36] <babyswizz> where exactly do I check for it?
[18:39:59] <babyswizz> Where in the network tab do I look?
[18:41:07] <cannap> open dev tools
[18:41:12] <cannap> network tab
[18:41:34] <cannap> then you should see a request or something when you press the button...
[18:44:58] <babyswizz> I got a Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list on line 22
[18:59:08] <babyswizz> cannap, I think I got a hang on what went wrong
[19:01:09] <babyswizz> So the button actually lives within a form which also intends to hit the same endpoint. I wanted to use ajax to actually stop the button from making the request using the form and use ajax instead
[19:02:30] <cannap> does the page refresh when you hit the button?
[19:02:40] <babyswizz> But I noticed that when ever I take out the form tag ajax does make the request but when the form is present, ajax does nothing and the form makes the request
[19:02:46] <babyswizz> Yes it does
[19:02:58] <babyswizz> When the form tag is present
[19:03:11] <cannap> try this https://paste.laravel.io/e8KqV
[19:03:37] <babyswizz> if I take out the form tag it doesn't
[19:03:42] <cannap> this is because the normal behavior of the browser
[19:03:51] <cannap> or change type=button
[19:04:01] <cannap> submit will always submit
[19:04:21] <cannap> i forgot about this but e.preventDefault(); will stop the browser and let you do own stuff
[19:05:45] <cannap> as example when you do a rightclick you can say e.preventDefault and the normal context menu will not open instead you can add you custom as exmaple
[19:05:53] <cannap> sry my english sucks i try hard to explain xD
[19:06:31] <babyswizz> I understand you very well
[19:06:42] <babyswizz> your english is good
[19:07:39] <babyswizz> But then why does this work https://paste.laravel.io/q3WYG
[19:08:07] <babyswizz> without the e.preventDefault
[19:10:18] <babyswizz> cannap, your code still doesn't work
[19:10:26] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/8nktj5q7/2/
[19:10:41] <cannap> i have no i dea what you made wrong
[19:10:45] <cannap> i use this every day
[19:10:56] <cannap> ok i dont use jquery much
[19:10:59] <cannap> but it should work
[19:11:04] <cannap> do you know how to debug?
[19:12:12] <babyswizz> Not very good with javascript debugging
[19:13:20] <cannap> f12 and check console for error and network for see whe you click anythign changes
[19:13:30] <cannap> f12 just when you have win dont know how to open with a hotkey on mac
[19:15:35] <babyswizz> ok, thanks
[20:39:59] <WhirledPress> strange question. can you return a value in an event handler like $("elem").bind("somevent",function () {return something;});   var something=$("elem").trigger("somevent");
[20:52:24] <WhirledPress> I guess all the regulars are out marching for science today.
