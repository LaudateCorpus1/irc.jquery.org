[02:49:40] <ctmarco> Hello all hot to get input value after blur?
[02:49:58] <ctmarco> $("input").val ?
[03:01:04] <[0xAA]> yes, using that as function
[03:19:58] <skywater> hi everyone :)
[05:24:47] <jerit> my scroll event isn't shrinking the header for some reason. I wonder if I'm putting the scroll on the right element http://www.loganyoung.za.net
[05:25:27] <Cork> jerit: you put it on the element that has the scrollbar
[05:25:49] <Cork> so in your case $('html', body')
[05:26:49] <jerit> are you sure it's 'html, body'? The site uses an MDL layout which messes with the way things scroll
[05:26:58] <jerit> I'm had it on window, html, body, main
[05:27:03] <jerit> none seem to do anything
[07:34:10] <troop> hi. how can i select automaticaly an option from select after append?
[07:54:12] <Cork> troop: easiest is to just set the value on the select element with .val()
[08:18:41] <troop> thanks Cork
[08:20:22] <dglambert> morning
[08:28:26] <tomred_> Can anyone give me some guidance.  I'm trying to get the selected option text string  - https://jsfiddle.net/88qqqor5/28/
[08:29:20] <tomred_> I don't understand how I apply a select to my object.
[08:40:12] <AdamPDotty> why Do you need the text?
[08:40:30] <Cork> tomred_: myselect.find('option:selected').text()
[08:42:24] <AdamPDotty> hehe just did it with vanilla: this.options[this.selectedIndex].textContent
[08:42:41] <tomred_> Cork, Thanks.  Should filter have worked too?
[08:42:47] <Cork> no
[08:42:54] <Cork> it is child elements
[08:43:05] <Cork> filter filters the selection result
[08:44:08] <tomred_> Ah, I see. That's important to know.
[09:03:29] <troop> i have a select and i assigned it to a variable for example slct = $('#someSelect'); now how can i get option:last's attr from slct variable?
[09:09:07] <minikN> Is anyone able to tell me if {"rules":["file: { required: true }","name: { required: true }"]} is equivalent to {"rules":file: { required: true },name: { required: true }} ?
[09:09:52] <Cork> troop: slct.find('option').last()
[09:09:56] <Woet> minikN: why would it be?
[09:10:08] <Woet> minikN: parse it and you'd see it more clearly.
[09:10:38] <Cork> minikN: the second one isn't even valid
[09:11:02] <Cork> {"rules":{ file: { required: true },name: { required: true }}} would be though
[09:11:27] <Cork> minikN: the content of rules would be an array with a string in it
[09:11:39] <Cork> (in the first example)
[09:12:18] <minikN> Woet, Cork gimme a sec, I make it more clear what I'm actually asking
[09:33:43] <minikN> It doesn't work the way I want. I'm trying to built up my validation rules (Normally looking like this: https://laravel.io/bin/OeP7K) dynamically with a function. I'd look something like: https://laravel.io/bin/d98Bw I don't know if you get what I mean
[09:52:49] <minikN> Cork, Woet https://laravel.io/bin/KkEL9
[09:53:11] <Woet> minikN: your original question was "are they equivalent"
[09:53:23] <Woet> minikN: if you want help with actual code, you could have just asked. put a test case on jsfiddle
[09:54:03] <minikN> It's still the same question I guess, it comes down to whether line 4-11 is equivalent to line 26-33. If so, it should work.
[09:54:29] <Woet> minikN: why cant you try it?
[09:54:55] <Woet> minikN: btw, they're identical in your paste.
[09:55:37] <minikN> (equivalent apart from extention and minlength missing of course. I could try yeah, but the function isn't finished, and I wanted to make sure if my dynamically created object is equal to what it should be before I continue
[09:55:57] <Woet> minikN: why dont you just try it?
[09:59:10] <jtoy> Howdy Hoe!
[09:59:50] <Cork> minikN: yes, settings the rules as rules: rules will work
[10:00:01] <jtoy> I want to get the position of a single element from the top of the html container or top of the browser window. Offset and position don't work for me though
[10:00:06] <Cork> would have been much easier if you just asked that question to start with
[10:00:31] <Cork> jtoy: top of browser window isn't possible
[10:00:42] <Cork> top of browser content window is
[10:00:56] <jtoy> yes that is what I want
[10:01:58] <Cork> that is what $(elm).offset() gives you
[10:03:02] <jtoy> but i want the position from the top regardless of scroll position
[10:03:41] <Cork> so you want it relative to the document top then?
[10:03:45] <Cork> not the window
[10:04:05] <jtoy> yes
[10:04:14] <Cork> that isn't what you asked :)
[10:04:40] <jtoy> I wasnt sure on the wording there
[10:06:29] <jtoy> i think i found what I need
[10:07:48] <Cork> i think you need to use getBoundingClientRect for that
[10:08:09] <Cork> checked around in jquery helper and offset doesn't provide a way to not do window.pageXOffset reduction
[10:27:54] <LIERO> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ygXdvE
[10:28:09] <LIERO> does anyone have any idea why this doesnÂ´t work with Chrome?
[10:28:37] <LIERO> the obvious culprit is html, body { height:100% ; overflow-x:hidden; }
[10:28:42] <LIERO> but I cannot remove it
[11:14:39] <snfgf> hello
[11:14:47] <snfgf> i have list of list items
[11:15:09] <snfgf> myListItems, I want to select everything BUT one item that has a particular id
[11:15:39] <snfgf> myListItems.filter('not(' + myId + '))?
[11:15:44] <snfgf> something like that perhaps
[11:15:45] <snfgf> ?
[11:15:49] <taplar> .not('#theid')
[11:15:55] <snfgf> cool :)
[11:41:15] <snfgf> how do i create an empty jquery array that i can add objects to?
[11:41:35] <taplar> $()
[11:41:47] <taplar> what are you calling 'objects
[11:41:51] <taplar> ' though?
[11:42:11] <taplar> because a jquery object is intented to store dom nodes, not just random objects
[11:49:10] <snfgf> guys
[11:49:14] <snfgf> http://pastebin.com/fsVrMAiC
[11:49:31] <snfgf> should something like this work, to return a list of the objects that match?
[11:50:41] <taplar> are you looking for whole word matches?
[11:50:48] <snfgf> no
[11:50:52] <snfgf> i want partial word matches
[11:51:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd use indexOf() > -1
[11:51:37] <taplar> yeah, i was fixing ot make a fiddle
[11:52:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3rb556ct/
[11:52:53] <snfgf> thanks
[11:53:10] <snfgf> works very nice
[11:57:08] <snfgf> is there a quick way to get all elements in myList that aren't in matchedItems?
[11:57:24] <snfgf> without looping through one and checking the other?
[11:57:41] <taplar> myList.not(matchedItems) perhaps
[11:59:18] <snfgf> taplar, ty, works well
[12:01:20] <MassDebates> Can I test the speed of two similar javascript lines?
[12:01:30] <MassDebates> I haven't found anything that allows me to write it and time it.
[12:01:36] <MassDebates> unless if I write it on my own
[12:01:58] <taplar> i usually just write my own little thing
[12:02:03] <MassDebates> with console.time or whateveR?
[12:02:10] <taplar> get the Date.now() before it and compare with Date.now() afterwards
[12:02:22] <MassDebates> okay, thanks
[12:02:39] <taplar> and you'll probably want to loop the line a few thousand times to get any sort of compariable difference
[12:03:20] <MassDebates> Right
[12:03:50] <robertmaxrees> jsperf
[12:06:27] <robertmaxrees> though be carefuly when falling into that trap.
[12:07:07] <MassDebates> I'm not allowed to touch our github anymore
[12:07:14] <MassDebates> I'm doing a timer
[12:07:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't need github...
[12:07:27] <MassDebates> To log in and create a test case?
[12:07:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:07:43] <robertmaxrees> just an account.
[12:07:57] <MassDebates> oh right
[12:07:57] <MassDebates> DUH
[12:07:59] <MassDebates> lmao, I can just make a separate one
[12:08:15] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:08:21] <robertmaxrees> you should already have a github account, right?
[12:08:34] <MassDebates> I have the member account of our group github thing
[12:08:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean one in an org?
[12:09:15] <MassDebates> I think so
[12:09:24] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[12:09:28] <MassDebates> I'm making a separate one though. I don't want to piss off anyone
[12:09:32] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:09:37] <robertmaxrees> it won't impact anything about your org.
[12:09:38] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[12:09:45] <MassDebates> Okay
[13:38:27] <qakhan> hi all, i am using dataTable responsive. i am trying to add dynamically a button by press Add button in last column of row.
[13:39:24] <qakhan> i can see new button was added but not showing in last column of first row when i click on + sign
[13:39:34] <qakhan> here is my code.    https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/4/
[13:40:00] <qakhan> newly created button html can be seen in console
[13:40:18] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/api/row.add()
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> you want this.
[13:41:51] <qakhan> robertmaxrees i am modifing row. i am adding a button in the row
[13:43:31] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the markup isn't what you think it is.
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> inspect it.
[13:43:48] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/examples/ajax/null_data_source.html
[13:45:17] <robertmaxrees> looks like the docs have plenty of info.  same with SO
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:46:49] <Lucenut> Hey guys. I just installed jquery.doubleScroll.js
[13:47:18] <Lucenut> Works great with a fixed width. But I'm trying to use it on a div that is percentage.
[13:47:59] <Lucenut> I saw there's a resetOnWindowResize
[13:48:09] <Lucenut> But I can't figure out how to do it.
[13:48:21] <Lucenut> Anyone familiar with it?
[13:48:32] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle and docs?
[13:48:57] <Lucenut> Hmm. Never done that before.
[13:49:20] <robertmaxrees> should be a pretty simple test case.
[13:50:15] <qakhan> robertmaxrees is https://datatables.net/examples/ajax/null_data_source.html for me?
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> qakhan you're the only one asking about datatables :)
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm just tossing out potential solutions.
[13:50:38] <robertmaxrees> not sure if any of them would actually work.
[13:51:51] <qakhan> robertmaxrees if i am not using responsive datatable then i can see dynamic added button
[13:52:13] <robertmaxrees> alright.  no idea tbh.  datatables has a forum.  have you tried there?
[13:55:22] <qakhan> no help there
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> you made a post?
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> how long did you wait?
[13:58:26] <qakhan> i did not make post there yet. i made 1 post in Nov 2016 and still waiting for that post response.
[13:59:34] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just sayin'
[14:02:52] <jerit_> I'm seriously starting to feel like this transition thing isn't possible at this point... Really disappointed in 24 hours I've yet to make any progress on it
[14:02:54] <jerit_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41832137/my-header-shrink-transition-is-incomplete-what-have-i-missed
[14:03:38] <robertmaxrees> jerit is the JS adding and removing that class correctly?
[14:04:18] <jerit_> robertmaxrees: looks okay in the dev console
[14:05:05] <robertmaxrees> coupla thoughts: throttle that scroll handler and cache those jquery selectors before the handler.
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd ask in #css
[14:05:30] <jerit_> I've been asking there all day... they're remarkably unhelpful
[14:05:49] <jerit_> [21:05] <robertmaxrees> coupla thoughts: throttle that scroll handler and cache those jquery selectors before the handler.         <<< no idea what you mean
[14:07:10] <robertmaxrees> so $() can be a little slow, and scroll handlers fire many times per seconds.  that can cause slowdowns.  so do var Header = $(".portfolio-header"); before you bind.
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> also do you have multiple $(".mdl-layout__content") elements?
[14:07:50] <jerit_> no, just the one
[14:07:53] <jerit_> it's on my <main>
[14:08:05] <robertmaxrees> then store $(".mdl-layout__content") in a var before, as well.
[14:08:10] <robertmaxrees> and reference that var inside.
[14:08:17] <MikeD_> jerit_: fwiw, i kinda hate that effect
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> also no need for shrink to be defined in there, as well.
[14:08:48] <jerit_> MikeD_: here's what I started with https://getmdl.io/templates/portfolio/index.html
[14:08:53] <jerit_> it's quite jarring
[14:09:00] <robertmaxrees> also, search google for javascript throttle
[14:09:01] <MikeD_> maybe you have a good use for it, but the demo (http://callmenick.com/_development/resize-header-on-scroll/) feels icky to me
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> or just use ^
[14:09:30] <jerit_> MikeD_: that's actually the same demo I worked from to write this
[14:09:52] <jerit_> if you have an easier alternative I'd love to try it
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> also, check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change
[14:10:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit #css for more info on getting the CSS to work right.
[14:10:46] <MikeD_> no suggestion... mostly just that it seems like you're working too hard for a gimmicky effect
[14:12:42] <jerit_> it might be gimicky but even a gimic is better than essentially wasting 200-300px of real estate on a permanent basis by leaving the header and menu static
[14:13:11] <robertmaxrees> heh why does that logo need to be that big?
[14:13:16] <taplar> you could do the quick reveal option
[14:13:17] <robertmaxrees> or be made sticky at all?
[14:13:18] <MikeD_> true - i generally ignore the header no matter what size it is, so *shrug*
[14:14:20] <MikeD_> the quick reveal option =?= breakaway pants?
[14:14:46] <taplar> scroll down, the menu slides up out of view, scroll up some, it pops back in
[14:15:06] <taplar> think any mobile device browser
[14:16:23] <taplar> hiddenworld.taplar.com <-- choose one of the level summary options so you get a scroll bar, and you can see it
[14:17:17] <MikeD_> hmm... i couldn't pass up a visit to hiddenworld... but it's proxy blocked :(
[14:17:38] <taplar> ah
[14:18:01] <MikeD_> i know you mean - i use firefox on android
[14:33:34] <jtoy> hello
[14:33:58] <MikeD_> hi
[14:34:43] <jtoy> How can I get an elements position from the top of the document? I want to absolutely position an item to the right of another element and heve their tops align
[14:35:23] <taplar> have you tried $theElement.offset().top ?
[14:36:45] <MikeD_> i suggest making a jsfiddle.net example
[14:38:54] <qakhan> taplar can you please loot at my question?
[14:39:19] <taplar> datatables?  what did i do to piss you off man?
[14:39:35] <qakhan> hahahah
[14:40:01] <qakhan> you did not do anything. just asking if you can help
[14:43:41] <taplar> i resized the iframe after hitting the add button, and it looks like your button is being added, it's just hidden
[14:44:42] <qakhan> yes, new button is being added but not showing in row
[14:46:58] <taplar> i'm seeing it in the row, provided the iframe is large enough to include the company column
[14:49:08] <qakhan> why its not showing next to company name
[14:49:25] <taplar> what do you mean next to?
[14:49:34] <taplar> you're using html().  that replaces whatever is there
[14:50:29] <taplar> use append() instead of html() if you want to add the button next to the existing company text
[14:53:43] <qakhan> taplar still not showing new button in last row
[14:54:00] <taplar> what size do you have the iframe at?
[14:54:07] <taplar> is the company column showing at all?
[14:55:07] <jerit_> so I've got my page arranged so that it makes more sense
[14:55:14] <qakhan> taplar here is my new code with .append    https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/5/
[14:55:41] <taplar> that's still using html
[14:56:16] <jerit_> only problem now is that the header doesn't stay in view when you scroll so I don't know if the transition is working
[14:56:25] <qakhan> sorry old link here is new link https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/6/
[14:57:00] <taplar> https://fiddle.jshell.net/6faumn44/7/
[14:58:04] <qakhan> taplar i cannot use div width 80%, it can be max 40%
[14:58:20] <taplar> i'm just showing you that the button is being put there
[14:58:37] <taplar> if you are limited to 40%, dunno what you tell you man
[14:58:38] <qakhan> i know
[14:59:04] <Guest35452> Hello :)
[14:59:25] <Guest35452> I need some jquery help, is this the right place?
[15:00:00] <taplar> yep
[15:00:10] <qakhan> think about it. if a user open this table on smart device then table will hide columns.
[15:00:44] <qakhan> if columns hide then there is no button
[15:00:52] <taplar> sure, i understand that
[15:01:04] <taplar> i'm saying i don't know of a work around
[15:01:35] <taplar> is it possible for the company column to be closer to the front?
[15:01:36] <qakhan> if table is not response then everything will be out of screen
[15:01:38] <Guest35452> Anyone know anything about the Instagram API? I have a jquery plugin (instafetch.js) displaying my images, but I want to show pictures with a specific hashtag only. Cant seem to figure it out
[15:09:05] <sillyslux> Guest35452, was that you? https://github.com/thomasvaeth/instafetch.js/issues/2
[15:09:11] <Guest35452> Yes
[15:18:29] <robertmaxrees> Guest35452 http://stackoverflow.com/a/36142229/923919
[15:18:32] <robertmaxrees> this relevantto you?
[15:21:03] <sillyslux> "get your app reviewed by Instagram first", oh.. what are they afraid of?
[15:21:38] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) probably a simple gate to prevent people from recreating instagram itself.
[15:21:47] <robertmaxrees> using their infrastructure.  something like that.
[15:21:51] <sillyslux> oh good point
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> prety common thing.
[15:27:39] <Guest35452> Unfortunately instagram updated their API june or july 2016
[15:29:06] <jerit_> my jquery doesn't throw any errors but the transition isn't working :/ https://jsfiddle.net/bhup0juj/1/
[15:29:45] <jerit_> or at least... it works on the fiddle
[15:30:02] <robertmaxrees> i actually know the dude who was the chief ios engineer at instagram'
[15:30:31] <robertmaxrees> jerit i'd ask in #css
[15:31:03] <Guest35452> Could you ask him?
[15:31:13] <Guest35452> Kidding ofcourse. That's pretty cool
[15:31:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:31:21] <robertmaxrees> he's the head of react native these days.
[15:31:47] <robertmaxrees> or at least was.  not sure what he's up to.
[15:32:02] <robertmaxrees> was at my company before he left for insta
[15:32:39] <jerit_> robertmaxrees: my event handler isn't getting hit
[15:32:41] <taplar> 0.3s transition time...
[15:34:01] <robertmaxrees> btw https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bhup0juj/2/
[15:34:09] <robertmaxrees> so the handler isn't getting hit on your site?
[15:35:45] <jerit_> I added a console.log("you scrolled"); into the function and it never logged anything
[15:35:52] <jerit_> http://www.loganyoung.za.net is the site if you wanna look
[15:36:36] <MassDebates> jerit_:  I've looked at your scrolling detection. I can't see it doing any at all, but I see the code there.
[15:36:53] <MassDebates> jerit_: I'd guess it's done detecting before I get a chance to scroll and open up console panel
[15:37:10] <robertmaxrees> even doing it manually doesn't work.
[15:37:14] <MassDebates> jerit_:  I'd suggest looking into when it fires with regards to the DOM and what's been processed
[15:37:40] <MassDebates> Let me do this with an f5 and reopen console. Just to make sure I'm not giving you a red herring. (i'm more CSS-y than Jquery-y)
[15:38:02] <robertmaxrees> figured it out.
[15:38:05] <MassDebates> Hm, yes
[15:38:41] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:38:59] <jerit_> only I can take working code and fuck it up so that it mysteriously breaks in my implementation -_-
[15:39:02] <MassDebates> I opened it up, I can get about 40-ish scroll ticks before it stops.
[15:39:07] <robertmaxrees> the window isn't scrolling.
[15:39:17] <robertmaxrees> a child element is.
[15:39:28] <jerit_> O-o
[15:39:38] <MassDebates> http://imgur.com/a/786e6
[15:39:49] <robertmaxrees> right
[15:39:52] <robertmaxrees> css.
[15:39:52] <MassDebates> It looks like it stops scrolling when the header element is done being rendered.
[15:39:59] <MassDebates> Stops scrolling detection*
[15:40:01] <robertmaxrees> ie when the css renders.
[15:40:13] <MassDebates> That doesn't make this a CSS problem.
[15:40:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm noit saying it does.
[15:40:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm sayinghe's bound to the wrong element.
[15:40:27] <MassDebates> #CSS is an innapropriate place for Jerit_ to be directed to.
[15:40:30] <jerit_> so what's the solution?
[15:40:30] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:40:35] <robertmaxrees> i'mnot suggesting that MassDebates
[15:40:41] <robertmaxrees> i don't know why you keep insisting that i am.
[15:40:47] <MassDebates> That's what I was told.
[15:40:52] <robertmaxrees> by whom?
[15:40:57] <robertmaxrees> jerit one sec.
[15:40:58] <MassDebates> I thought you might send me to #jquery but they're telling me to come here
[15:41:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:41:12] <MassDebates> "I thought you might send me to #jquery but they're telling me to come here " woops, forgot quotes.
[15:41:13] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[15:41:25] <MassDebates> per Jerit_
[15:41:27] <jerit_> [22:30] <robertmaxrees> jerit i'd ask in #css
[15:41:32] <robertmaxrees> that was a long time ago.
[15:41:33] * jerit_ shrugs
[15:41:34] <MassDebates> wait
[15:41:35] <MassDebates> what
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> for a different question.
[15:41:40] <MassDebates> DUde that was 22:30
[15:41:40] <robertmaxrees> jerit $('.mdl-layout').on('scroll', () => console.log('foo'));
[15:41:46] <MassDebates> DUDE
[15:41:47] <MassDebates> THATS
[15:41:52] <MassDebates> WHAT
[15:41:52] <MassDebates> I POINTED AT
[15:41:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah over an hour ago for a different question.
[15:41:54] <MassDebates> JERIT CMON MANG
[15:41:58] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[15:41:59] <taplar> lets drop it
[15:42:14] <jerit_> 22:30 by my clock was 10 minutes ago but maybe I misunderstood you, sorry
[15:42:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> it's fair.
[15:42:24] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> it's because the windows isn't the scrolling element.
[15:42:39] <robertmaxrees> .mdl-layout__content is.
[15:43:34] <robertmaxrees> the height: 100% on html, body, and .mdl-layout is what's causing that.
[15:43:49] <MassDebates> Yeah I see it now
[15:43:52] <MassDebates> (window)
[15:44:46] <MassDebates> So I was able to get scroll ticks because it was scrolling the window because it wasnt done with mdl-layout yet
[15:44:47] <MassDebates> neat
[15:44:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:44:54] <MassDebates> apparently about 45 of them
[15:45:11] <robertmaxrees> all dependent on your browser, connection, computer, mouse, etc.
[15:45:19] <MassDebates> yes
[15:45:28] <MassDebates> Wow, that's a sneaky thing. The overflow of an element vs a window
[15:45:32] <robertmaxrees> jerit that answe your question?
[15:45:34] <MassDebates> You'd think that browsers would have different styles
[15:45:34] <robertmaxrees> *answer
[15:45:51] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates that's why this is hard setting all of those itself.
[15:46:03] <robertmaxrees> probably includes a reset of some kind to smooth out those differences.
[15:48:39] <robertmaxrees> jerit_ you good?
[15:49:10] <jerit_> well the transition is happening but nothing is getting smaller and my menu bar isn't moving
[15:49:17] <jerit_> otherwise the jquery works
[15:49:18] <robertmaxrees> site link again
[15:49:23] <robertmaxrees> pls
[15:49:24] <jerit_> http://www.loganyoung.za.net
[15:49:39] <MassDebates> Good stuff, now it's CSS.
[15:50:42] <robertmaxrees> not seeing any styles apply.
[15:51:11] <MassDebates> the actuation is there. It's detecting some form of a scroll. I'm just saying it's now a CSS issue
[15:51:20] <robertmaxrees> grats :)
[15:51:44] <robertmaxrees> .portfolio-logo-row and stuff
[15:51:50] <robertmaxrees> don't respect that .smaller class.
[15:51:51] <MassDebates> jerit_:  now would be the time to go back and ask in #css about this.
[15:52:10] <robertmaxrees> this is simple enough for this channel >.>
[15:52:12] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[15:52:55] <MassDebates> Not my channel - I've no power! I just wanted to push him into the habit of appropriate channel inquiries
[15:53:19] <MassDebates> However, he probably SHOULD throw in the javascript necessary to handle the other containers in his header
[15:53:39] <robertmaxrees> nah, fix the css so all those child elements respond to the class on that parent.
[15:53:45] <robertmaxrees> instead of modifying a ton of dom nodes.
[15:54:14] <MassDebates> That'll work better
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> mmhmm
[15:56:39] <taplar> btw, isn't this a typo? ".portfolio-header. {"
[15:56:45] <taplar> saw it in the fiddle too
[15:56:45] <robertmaxrees> probly
[15:58:26] <crst> Hi guys, I'd like to scale a table's contents to always fill/display one line per cell, with the same font size for each cell, but the max fontsize possible. It's not important how small the text will be. How could I achieve this?
[15:59:43] <MassDebates> I mean, I could think of a couple ways in CSS but you likely need something different
[16:00:39] <crst> MassDebates: you talking to me? I think it's not possible with css alone.
[16:01:31] <MassDebates> Yes, I was talking to you
[16:02:12] <crst> Ok, you think this could be done in pure css?
[16:02:16] <MassDebates> It's likely you need something more robust than just CSS changing the appearance. I would like to know more context before I suggest it.
[16:02:23] <MassDebates> Why are you doing this? What's it for
[16:05:28] <crst> I'm trying to make a blog. See the table here: https://www.crstin.com/en/logipcron/   I'd like to visualize data nicely, kind of an overview and, if you want more info you can zoom in...
[16:06:17] <MassDebates> You mean this? https://www.crstin.com/en/logipcron/#the-logfile
[16:06:51] <crst> yepp
[16:08:15] <crst> I'll definitely be posting more tables and data
[16:08:17] <MassDebates> crst:  https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/
[16:08:40] <MassDebates> Please see the above article and this example: https://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php
[16:09:21] <MassDebates> This uses Media queries to "snap-in" the new looks - a reformatted table that's more appropriate for viewing on mobile. While your needs are slightly different, I feel this gives you valuable information that you can use to do what you need to do.
[16:09:48] <MassDebates> CSS can do what you want. The most difficult part is the "max fontsize possible" -> this can still be done.
[16:10:28] <MassDebates> Javascript will be useful in that fontsize negotiation. You can still do it with pure CSS in both appropriate and hackish ways with varying levels of effort
[16:10:58] <MassDebates> Up to you, of course. Here's what I'd do, if I were you:
[16:11:26] <MassDebates> Go to #css and ask a person named " innovati " about this. He'll love you for it, and will give you a plethora of attractive options
[16:11:48] <MassDebates> he also made EQCSS - I think he has some pre-baked solutions in stock for this specifically.
[16:18:37] <crst> MassDebates: Thank your thorough thought on this. Well, when innovati loves me for asking him about this I should definitely do it :)
[16:18:53] <MassDebates> Speak of the devil.
[16:19:01] <innovati> eyy
[16:19:11] <MassDebates> crst:  Ask this dude. He's like
[16:19:11] <MassDebates> crst:  Well he's really cool.
[16:19:15] <MassDebates> (sorta.)
[16:19:24] <innovati> :O
[16:19:27] <crst> lol, Hi innovati
[16:19:39] <crst> How are you doing?
[16:19:50] <innovati> hi, I'm okay
[16:19:52] <innovati> what's up
[16:20:33] <crst> MassDebates told me I should reach out to you and tell you about my problem with displaying tables
[16:20:42] <MassDebates> I did. That's me!
[16:20:54] <crst> :D
[16:21:00] <MassDebates> crst: Hi guys, I'd like to scale a table's contents to always fill/display one line per cell, with the same font size for each cell, but the max fontsize possible. It's not important how small the text will be. How could I achieve this?
[16:21:09] <MassDebates> I'm trying to make a blog. See the table here: https://www.crstin.com/en/logipcron/   I'd like to visualize data nicely, kind of an overview and, if you want more info you can zoom in...
[16:21:24] <MassDebates> MassDebates: You mean this? https://www.crstin.com/en/logipcron/#the-logfile
[16:21:42] <MassDebates> what do you think innovati
[16:21:49] <MassDebates> This seems like right up EQ's alley
[16:22:22] <MassDebates> I showed him this: https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/ to kick off, and that can handle some of the stuff, but I think EQ would really be able to do some heavy lifting
[16:22:32] <innovati> well if you're looking for a jQuery solution what about http://fittextjs.com/ or https://github.com/zachleat/BigText
[16:22:35] <MassDebates> I have no idea why I'm so excited to see EQ get used for something, but this seems like a great opportunity
[16:22:54] <bjsnider> is it possible to post values to a php form?
[16:22:58] <MassDebates> That's nice, but that's only solving part of his problem.
[16:23:06] <innovati> what's the other part?
[16:23:18] <taplar> bjsnider: say what?
[16:23:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[16:23:22] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:23:27] <robertmaxrees> tha convused me, too.
[16:23:37] <robertmaxrees> *confused
[16:24:10] <innovati> here's how I do responsive tables http://codepen.io/tomhodgins/post/responsive-tables
[16:24:16] <bjsnider> i'd rather not have to go that far
[16:24:18] <MassDebates> Font size negotiation can be done with fittext or similar, but I'm just saying that EQ could do heavy lifting
[16:24:28] <innovati> what heavy lifting?
[16:24:46] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider huh?
[16:24:48] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/tomhodgins/post/responsive-tables#element-queries-5
[16:24:54] <taplar> bjsnider: i'm confused by your question be cause you do not post to a form.  you post to an endpoint
[16:24:54] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider what are you trying to do?
[16:25:24] <innovati> here's an example of a responsive table styled using that technique http://codepen.io/tomhodgins/pen/akrRqX
[16:25:35] <bjsnider> i'd like to avoid using anything but php to post
[16:25:47] <taplar> php doesn't post
[16:25:53] <taplar> php is a backend language
[16:25:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:25:58] <bjsnider> but i have a table full of names in each row, and checkboxes. i need to limit the naes to the row that is checked
[16:26:02] <taplar> you can use it to process a request, but it does not make requets
[16:26:04] <robertmaxrees> you must post from your frontend using html or js
[16:26:29] <bjsnider> right now i'm posting using html
[16:26:46] <bjsnider> but i post the entire table instead of just the selected row
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> are you passing the status of a checkbox for each?
[16:27:00] <taplar> bjsnider: couple ways you can do that then
[16:27:14] <taplar> 1) you can do an ajax request and only send the element that are checked
[16:27:28] <taplar> 2) you can disable the elements that are not checked prior to submitting and they will not be sent
[16:27:29] <bjsnider> which i could deal with using php in the action code, by checking based on an id number, but i'd rather limit the post to the sleected row
[16:29:56] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[16:30:00] <robertmaxrees> if you don't mind my asking.
[16:34:18] <bjsnider> maybe i should post using javascript too. i suppose that would allow for bouncing the result message back to the form script
[16:34:30] <robertmaxrees> sure, you could use ajax.
[16:34:43] <taplar> 'too'?
[16:36:08] <bjsnider> so i should do if table tr has a checkbox that isn't checked, remove the name attributes?
[16:37:03] <taplar> which approach are you thinking of going?  ajax or non?
[16:37:13] <bjsnider> ajax
[16:37:24] <bjsnider> i want that result message
[16:37:43] <taplar> then you would just select the fields that belong to a row that have the checked checkbox(es)
[16:37:55] <taplar> you wouldn't change the names or anything
[16:39:30] <crst> MassDebates: innovati: I actually really don't mind when it's like this https://www.crstin.com/en/logipcron/#the-logfile (updated view)   The only thing is that this setting only works for this table.   IMHO the responsive tables are super nice, but work for data which is more homogenously like in the examples you showed or equal in width.   when my inhomogenous data jumps to the next line it looks just horrid.  The data per se is also not super import
[16:39:30] <crst> ant, it's mor important that one can get a quick glance.
[16:40:25] <bjsnider> does jsfiddle really need an ev certificate? is it taking credit card data and whatnot?
[16:41:52] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) maybe some kind of law for german companies.
[16:43:34] <innovati> crst check the responsive styles on a table like this: http://staticresource.com/plg/import2.php
[16:44:35] <innovati> crst this one is better - it has a number of fields like yours, but when the browser is too narrow ti display the table in its full size, instead it switches to a set of styles that treat each <td> as though it's like its own <tr> http://staticresource.com/plg/new-record.php
[16:44:53] <innovati> each <tr> becomes its own miniature table in the responsive view
[16:46:58] <crst> innovati: make that 10 rows and fill some cells with much longer text. the breakpoint to mobile is of course nice but I'm not sure if I'd like to show big chucks of "unimportant" data to a mobile viewer.
[16:47:34] <innovati> Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ okay
[16:50:25] <crst> 3 rows, about max 20 chars, If I only had data like this :)
[17:02:58] <eyemiru> Hi guys, is it possible to reverse a gif with jquery only?
[17:03:11] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't really interact with files.
[17:09:33] <taplar> what do you mean 'reverse'?
[17:09:45] <eyemiru> run it backwards
[17:09:49] <taplar> ooooh
[17:09:51] <taplar> nvm
[17:10:07] <eyemiru> well, a php solution will do it then
[17:10:23] <eyemiru> thought maybe the frontend will handle it somehow ;)
[17:17:50] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[17:19:30] <robertmaxrees> i think i'm gonna go home after my 3:30 meeting and finish from there.
[17:19:41] <taplar> nice
[17:20:23] <robertmaxrees> i've actually been preferring working on my home rig lately.
[17:20:45] <taplar> i wish we had a better remote policy
[17:22:46] <robertmaxrees> https://goo.gl/Z1j0WV this is my current home rig.
[17:22:54] <robertmaxrees> a little cobbled together but it works well.
[17:23:08] <taplar> i hate you
[17:23:12] <eyemiru> looks good
[17:23:20] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:23:27] <eyemiru> I switched from 3 to 2 monitors
[17:23:31] <taplar> 3 mons, i'll get there some day
[17:23:37] <taplar> eh, maybe just 2
[17:23:48] <eyemiru> had not so much space
[17:23:50] <robertmaxrees> i only use three when i'm streaming and/or when i'm working from home.
[17:24:10] <eyemiru> so, youtube and website + code, I guess? ;)
[17:24:16] <taplar> you twitch or something?
[17:24:20] <robertmaxrees> sometimes yeah.
[17:24:34] <robertmaxrees> eyemiru i remote into my work machine so one monitor gets that dedicated.
[17:24:37] <robertmaxrees> run everything off that.
[17:24:40] <taplar> i haven't tried it yet, for fear it would affect performance of whatever game
[17:24:46] <robertmaxrees> then code, docoumentation, etc on the other
[17:25:03] <robertmaxrees> taplar there's a new nvidia-specific codec for the 9xx (i think) and higher cards.
[17:25:10] <robertmaxrees> it's slightly lower quality but offloads to the GPU.
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> and you get barely any perf impact.
[17:25:22] <Woet> oh are we doing this? nice, here's mine: http://i.imgur.com/nHbIjyX.jpg
[17:25:39] <eyemiru> I like!
[17:25:42] <robertmaxrees> nice.  i wish i could get mached monitors.
[17:25:45] <robertmaxrees> *matched
[17:25:53] <robertmaxrees> razor wireless?
[17:26:03] <Woet> yea, but using it cabled most of the time
[17:26:09] <robertmaxrees> corsair kb?
[17:26:19] <Woet> nah razer too
[17:26:23] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:26:38] <eyemiru> Woet: isn't the keyboard a bit too inconvenient for coding?
[17:26:49] <Woet> eyemiru: i use my macbook
[17:26:52] <eyemiru> I see
[17:26:58] <Woet> windows is for gaming and random stuff only
[17:27:33] <robertmaxrees> how would that KB be inconvenient for coding?
[17:28:02] <eyemiru> keys too big and you are not fast enough
[17:28:13] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:28:15] <eyemiru> at least that's what I see
[17:28:22] <Woet> im pretty fast with either
[17:28:30] <Woet> but i prefer the lower travel on the macbook
[17:28:33] <Woet> and os x in general
[17:28:40] <eyemiru> and it's fucking loud typing on them
[17:28:43] <Woet> thats true
[17:28:50] <Woet> theres options with brown switches though
[17:28:53] <robertmaxrees> depends on the switch.  my 710+ isn't too bad.
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> also a lot of cherry switches don't need to be bottomed-out to register.
[17:31:34] <Woet> robertmaxrees: you should mount your monitors if you're allowed to
[17:31:40] <Woet> makes it look 10 times better and gives you a lot more space
[17:31:53] <Woet> either to the wall or a clamp you can attach to the desk itself
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> no point.  the ones on the right and left don't have mounts.
[17:31:59] <robertmaxrees> also money.
[17:32:01] <Woet> ah ok
[17:32:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:32:06] <Woet> the mount themselves i paid like 15 EUR each
[17:32:16] <eyemiru> he can't change the desk anymore after he mounts them
[17:32:18] <Woet> but yea if they dont have VESA then theres no point
[17:32:31] <robertmaxrees> i also don't want to modify the desk or have to patch my walls when i sell.
[17:32:39] <robertmaxrees> and the desk has plenty of space for my needs.
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> it's a big desk.
[17:33:31] <robertmaxrees> plus that monitor stand for the left one gives me a nice little spot to lean my work laptop up against the wall.
[17:42:51] <taplar> heh, Woet's setup makes it look like he's looking out windows
[17:43:51] <taplar> is it sad that my main take away from that pic is that that is a large mousepad?
[17:44:05] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:44:21] <taplar> seriously, look at the area of it as compaired to the laptop
[17:44:21] <robertmaxrees> gotta get dat csgo in
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> you look at mine?
[17:44:54] <taplar> woah, hey now
[17:44:56] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:45:16] <robertmaxrees> got you some
[17:45:18] <robertmaxrees> *get
[17:45:19] <taplar> *sigh*  i'm outclassed every where
[17:45:31] <robertmaxrees> that new video card is making me jelly though!
[17:45:38] <taplar> heh
[17:46:02] <robertmaxrees> that's probably my next upgrade.
[17:46:45] <taplar> i seriously didn't realize mine was that old.  i'm going to be going from an effective core clock of 6k to 10k.  it's going to be a crazy bump
[17:46:58] <Woet> get the nvidia 10 series
[17:46:59] <robertmaxrees> not just that
[17:47:05] <taplar> i am, :)
[17:47:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:47:10] <Woet> 1070 if you can, 1080 if you want
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> but the temp, cores, etc.
[17:47:18] <robertmaxrees> all of that's going to be better.
[17:48:11] <taplar> i was telling awkwardcough that i thought it was kinda funny that it recommended a 500 psu where as my current one recommended a 550 psu.  but then he pointed out that it has 2 fans vs 3 on my current one
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> also a smaller die with lower power consumption.
[17:48:39] <taplar> Woet: i'm getting the msi 1080
[17:48:44] <Woet> i have the evga one
[17:48:47] <Woet> with watercooling
[17:48:53] <Woet> slightly louder when idle but a lot quieter under load
[17:49:08] <taplar> i haven't gone down the watercooler route yet.  i've thought about the self contained ones before though
[17:49:14] <Woet> yea this one is it
[17:49:33] <Woet> http://www.fudzilla.com/images/stories/2016/June/evga-gtx-1080-hybrid.jpg
[17:49:34] <Woet> this one
[17:49:47] <robertmaxrees> nice
[17:49:54] <Woet> same thing for cpu
[17:49:57] <taplar> dunno that i need one.  the main game i play is not -that- graphical intensive.  it's pretty behind the times graphics wise.
[17:50:06] <Woet> self contained is nice since its their fault if it leaks
[17:50:07] <Woet> not mine
[17:50:17] <taplar> nice
[17:50:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't generate enough heat on any of my gear to need water cooling.
[17:50:56] <Woet> VR generates a lot of heat
[17:51:04] <taplar> heh, ever seen some of those vids where they submerge the mobos?
[17:51:18] <Woet> ya, i wouldnt want that
[17:51:31] <Woet> its high maintenance
[17:51:35] <Woet> especially if you want to make changes
[17:51:41] <taplar> oh i'm sure
[17:51:52] <robertmaxrees> not saying they don't generate a lot of heat, just saying my rig isn't crazy enough to need anything more than decent air cooling.
[17:51:54] <taplar> i just like to watch peeps do crazy stuff
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:52:04] <robertmaxrees> like peltier coolers.
[17:52:06] <Woet> if i buy a house (instead of renting) i'd like to have a server/desktop in another room
[17:52:12] <Woet> and just make a hole in the wall and run all the cables
[17:52:16] <Woet> that way sound doesnt matter at all
[17:52:21] <robertmaxrees> Woet i've seen those.  LTT did that in fact.
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> only needed one cable iirc.
[17:52:39] <robertmaxrees> thunderbolt carried everything for him.
[17:52:44] <Woet> yea theres fibre kvms that do everything
[17:52:49] <Woet> but im not sure about the latency when encoding/decoding it
[17:52:57] <robertmaxrees> none really.
[17:53:05] <robertmaxrees> no real decoding.
[17:53:05] <taplar> i used to dream about having my own net server at home.  generator back and all
[17:53:09] <robertmaxrees> just signal plittinmg
[17:53:12] <robertmaxrees> *splitting
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> taplar one of these days...
[17:53:23] <taplar> heh
[17:55:05] <robertmaxrees> my wife actually wants me to build one.
[17:57:57] <bjsnider> for ajax pages that auto-update with new data, i guess that's a function that runs a db query every x number of seconds?
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[17:58:32] <robertmaxrees> some of them use server push to handle that.
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, recursive ajax calls.
[17:58:58] <bjsnider> server push?
[17:59:13] <robertmaxrees> the server pushes updated data to the client.
[17:59:22] <robertmaxrees> using websockets or something else.
[17:59:33] <robertmaxrees> depends on the browser support you need.
[17:59:59] <bjsnider> well, assuming nothing older than ie 8 or so
[18:00:44] <robertmaxrees> then you're looking at either doing a fallback or recursive ajax calls.
[18:00:46] <bjsnider> or assume just latest ff/chrome
[18:01:08] <robertmaxrees> which is it heh
[18:01:24] <bjsnider> the latter
[18:01:33] <robertmaxrees> then check out websockets and stuff.
[18:01:54] <bjsnider> how would it know there's new data to display?
[18:02:08] <robertmaxrees> the server pushes new data.
[18:02:19] <robertmaxrees> and the frontend is sitting and waiting for that connection.
[18:02:33] <bjsnider> how does the server know there's new data?
[18:02:40] <robertmaxrees> from the db?
[18:02:42] <robertmaxrees> it queries.
[18:03:00] <bjsnider> at regular intervals
[18:03:09] <robertmaxrees> could store a cache, check the query against the cache, and send different data.
[18:03:14] <robertmaxrees> few different ways.
[18:04:50] <robertmaxrees> why does the data need to update in near-realtime though?
[18:05:48] <bjsnider> just wondering how often the queries are typically run, eg. every minute, every 30 seconds etc.
[18:06:03] <robertmaxrees> and again i'd have to ask my question.
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> because this all really depends on the application.
[18:06:10] <bjsnider> twitter has a system that tell you there's an update but doesn't actually show the updates without intervention
[18:06:53] <robertmaxrees> what're you building?
[18:07:04] <bjsnider> i never said it had to update in near-realtime
[18:07:16] <robertmaxrees> so why does it need to update automatically then?
[18:07:59] <bjsnider> it would be useful to alert users that an update they might be interesting in adding is already there, added by soemone else
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[18:13:31] <sillyslux> haha seen Woet 's setup, remembered the ergotron dual lx i once had and now for the 100s time surfing on http://www.ergotron.com/en-us/ again, hah, i want it back
[19:26:41] <sdwrage> Has anyone ran into an issue with the DataTables plugin and certain columns not being searchable?
[22:00:22] <cluelessperson> hi all, can someone tell me why this javascript/jquery doesn't scroll the page down to the next one?
[22:00:23] <cluelessperson> https://jsfiddle.net/5buducgw/2/
[22:06:13] <Woet> cluelessperson: do you know what kind of parameter scrollTop takes?
[22:06:27] <cluelessperson> Woet, Hmm.  No. :)
[22:06:34] <Woet> cluelessperson: that'd be a good thing to check
[22:08:56] <cluelessperson> Woet, I'm thinking it takes a position/coordinate
[22:09:10] <Woet> cluelessperson: theres no need to think, its well documented
[22:09:24] <cluelessperson> Woet, http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/css_scrolltop.asp
[22:09:46] <Woet> cluelessperson: w3schools is pretty bad, but it tells you right there.
[22:09:51] <Woet> cluelessperson: "Specifies the vertical scrollbar position in pixels"
[22:15:09] <cluelessperson> Woet, ah, I forgot to correct the variable.  Thanks
[22:15:13] <Woet> np
[22:16:12] <cluelessperson> Woet, hm,  so in that jsfiddle, it works, and rotates to top, but on my page, it doesn't rotate to top
[22:16:35] <Woet> cluelessperson: time to fix whatever other code that interferes with it then
[22:16:51] <cluelessperson> Woet, there's no, the page is very simple.
[22:17:10] <Woet> cluelessperson: i dont know what you expect me to tell you.
[22:17:23] <Woet> cluelessperson: if it works on jsfiddle it will work everywhere else.
[22:20:21] <cluelessperson> Woet, https://cluelessperson.com/resume/index.html
[22:20:29] <cluelessperson> versus
[22:20:30] <cluelessperson> https://jsfiddle.net/5buducgw/5/
[22:20:54] <Woet> cluelessperson: works fine here
[22:21:11] <cluelessperson> Woet, the second page does not work
[22:21:24] <Woet> cluelessperson: you mean clicking on page 2?
[22:21:56] <cluelessperson> yes
[22:22:25] <Woet> cluelessperson: did you check the console?
[22:23:13] <cluelessperson> Woet, Uncaught type error, I don't get it in jsfiddle
[22:23:31] <Woet> cluelessperson: you know the code isnt the same on your site right?
[22:24:02] * cluelessperson copies to be sure
[22:24:04] <Woet> cluelessperson: you should probably check on which line that error occurs..
[22:25:49] <cluelessperson> Woet, line 4
[22:26:04] <Woet> cluelessperson: okay... now compare that line with the line of jsfiddle...
[22:26:18] <Woet> cluelessperson: if you don't start in putting more effort yourself i'll give up
[22:27:19] <Woet> okay, i see you updated the code
[22:31:41] <Woet> cluelessperson: its because theres a <script> element on jsfiddle that it attaches to
[22:31:54] <Woet> cluelessperson: which isnt on your site (since your code in your <head> tag)
[22:32:12] <Woet> cluelessperson: you should read up on .closest and .next because they wont do what you want them to do
[22:59:17] <cluelessperson> Woet, sorry for disappearing, had to drive home
[22:59:20] <cluelessperson> don't intend rudeness
[22:59:33] <cluelessperson> I'm reading undefined
[22:59:41] <cluelessperson> which means it doesn't find it
[23:32:30] <cluelessperson> So yeah, as far as I can tell, it's the same code.
[23:32:32] <cluelessperson> https://cluelessperson.com/resume/index.html
[23:50:54] <ngharo> cluelessperson: https://jsfiddle.net/5buducgw/10/
[23:56:19] <cluelessperson> ngharo, Thanks, but I found another solution
