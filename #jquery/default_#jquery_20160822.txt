[06:16:46] <chipyy> Hey people, here i have some jquery code where i am using ajax: http://pastebin.com/pucfDwfr
[06:17:25] <chipyy> now i have question, if checking in php would be valid, how could i cancel this action? and what does it serve succesfull there?
[06:37:54] <chipyy> Hey people, here i have some jquery code where i am using ajax: http://pastebin.com/pucfDwfr
[06:38:17] <chipyy> now i have question, if checking in php would be valid, how could i cancel this action? if i echo"error" in php?
[06:51:37] <Cork> chipyy: simplest is prob to send back a http 4xx status
[06:51:52] <Cork> chipyy: alternatively you can send a value and check the return value
[06:55:19] <chipyy> when i send data to PHP file and check it there ( for login user) and if something isnt good can i stop with echo or somehow different?
[06:55:52] <chipyy> because i dont what does success function
[06:55:58] <chipyy> or how its function..
[06:58:05] <chipyy> so i would like that on the button press will pick up values which are stored in data. In php it checks if this is the same like any user in database
[06:58:34] <chipyy> and if isnt, i would like that on my page would appear some message
[06:59:03] <chipyy> if the user exist and password is the same then i would like to create session,cookies,...
[07:00:33] <chipyy> and i am begginer in Ajax :)
[07:00:48] <souravbadami> I'm using jquery datetimepicker plugin on bootstrap modal over a textbox.
[07:01:06] <souravbadami> It's not showing up properly. Here's the view --> https://i.imgsafe.org/adb3bb85e1.png
[07:03:55] <chipyy> i couldnt even start datetimepicker .. but i guess your missing some css
[07:06:03] <souravbadami> chipyy: It's rendering when I inspect the elements.
[07:09:18] <chipyy> i little bit changed: http://pastebin.com/X1yrn2hj ,php http://pastebin.com/Tybrwrsx , what u mean with rendering?
[07:10:24] <chipyy> eh i was thinking that you are talking about my code...
[07:10:33] <souravbadami> chipyy: I mean, the entire css is being loaded.
[07:11:12] <chipyy> did u already change some css by yourself or added some css code?

[07:52:22] <Duikb00t> Hmm I am probably missing something very stupid here, https://www.pastery.net/pwmqkm/  but why I am only able to open ( on click ) my sidebar once?
[08:03:34] <Woet> Duikb00t: working demo on www.jsfiddle.net please
[08:03:45] <Duikb00t> Gimmea-seccond-plz
[08:09:53] <Duikb00t> Here you go Woet https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/
[08:10:02] <Duikb00t> You can close it, but can't open it again ><
[08:11:17] <Woet> Duikb00t: wheres the code thats supposed to close it on click?
[08:11:44] <Duikb00t> That's a bit the question,
[08:11:59] <Duikb00t> Wasn't there a way in the 'on' property a way I can add that as well?
[08:12:17] <Woet> Duikb00t: your hasClass if should be inside the on click
[08:13:48] <Duikb00t> Hmm I don't think so?
[08:13:57] <Duikb00t> I want when the page loads, that the menu shows up for 1500ms
[08:14:02] <Duikb00t> and then closes
[08:14:15] <FilipNortic_> Duikb00t: you have to check for the class inside as well
[08:14:19] <Woet> Duikb00t: okay, but you want it to close on click..
[08:14:25] <Woet> Duikb00t: so your code that closes it should also be in the on click.
[08:14:51] <Duikb00t> exactly.
[08:15:05] <FilipNortic_> maybee withou the timeout
[08:15:25] <Duikb00t> Exactly
[08:15:48] <Duikb00t> I should just add hide-menu-animation that class
[08:23:06] <Duikb00t> Hmmm https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/2/  >< still only goes for 1 time
[08:30:16] <AwkwardCough> Duikb00t: you might want to evaluate $('header nav')
[08:43:09] <Duikb00t> bah can't figure it out merde
[08:44:52] <Cork> what's the problem?
[08:47:16] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/5/
[08:47:17] <Duikb00t> I would like to have a sidebar menu which shows for 1500ms (or smthing) when I open my webpage. After that it should close and show a icon to show menu again
[08:47:18] <Cork> solved
[08:47:56] <Duikb00t> oh :D wtf
[08:48:03] <Cork> you add the class in one if case
[08:48:09] <Cork> and remove another class in the other
[08:48:12] <Cork> but you never reset
[08:48:19] <Duikb00t> Ohhh stupid me ><
[08:48:29] <Duikb00t> Is it also possible to prevent clicking twice when I enable the timeout? https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/6/
[08:48:33] <Cork> actually the removeClass i added is wrong
[08:49:46] <Cork> sure, you just have to ignore clicks while the timer is active
[08:52:33] <Duikb00t> how do you mean: the removeClass you added is wrong?
[08:53:49] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/8/
[08:54:52] <Cork> actually it might be cleaner to just use a class...
[08:55:29] <Duikb00t> That's things I should do more: var nav = $('header nav');
[08:55:37] <Duikb00t> I repeat myself too much
[08:55:54] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/9/
[08:56:03] <Cork> opps forgot to clean up all the cases...
[08:56:26] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ug9ogcnh/10/
[08:56:32] <Cork> missing one
[08:56:57] <Cork> ah, no that isn't the same
[08:57:04] <Cork> so ya /10/ should work
[08:57:31] <Cork> though i would prob merge the hide-menu-animations and show-menu-animations classes
[08:57:37] <Cork> no reason for it to be two separate classes
[08:57:40] <Duikb00t> Thanks a lot I got it now
[08:57:55] <Duikb00t> I have to say
[08:58:01] <Duikb00t> I never used "nav.removeData('timeout');" before
[08:58:03] <Duikb00t> removeData

[10:49:18] <GeekMonkey> Morning
[10:49:45] <GeekMonkey> I am wondering if someone can help me with a js script to make it work for each canvas area

[11:54:50] <ironbeard> I'm having trouble selecting elements of an SVG that's loaded in an <object> tag. My google-fu has shown me that others have had this issue, but none of their solutions seem to work for me. I'd like to select an SVGs <path> object and change it's ``fill`` property with jQuery if possible
[11:55:50] <robertmaxrees> ironbeard jquery doesn't really handle svg very well since jquery'
[11:56:08] <robertmaxrees> *jquery's really a dom abstraction library - you could check out something like http://keith-wood.name/svg.html to help fill in those galps.
[11:56:12] <robertmaxrees> *gaps
[11:56:37] <ironbeard> robertmaxrees: I fiddled around with the jquery-svg extension by Keith Wood, but wasn't able to figure out how to get what I want (but it also looks a bit dated)
[11:56:51] <robertmaxrees> it probably is a bit dated.
[11:56:53] <ironbeard> yeah, fair enough. Maybe I'll just try to learn his lirbary a bit better
[11:57:03] <robertmaxrees> either way, you'll be much better served by just learning the native api.
[11:57:33] <ironbeard> robertmaxrees: thanks for the explaination though :)
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:07:01] <alturic> hey guys, is there a way to get UTC time, 2 hours ago in yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss format or am I looking at writing a chunk of code?
[13:07:26] <MassDebates> Should be pretty easy.
[13:07:30] <taplar> look at moment.js
[13:07:56] <MassDebates> Couldn't he use date?
[13:08:05] <MassDebates> and chuck out the diff from current time?
[13:08:18] <taplar> current time of the user?
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> the date object in JS is confusing af fwiw.
[13:08:27] <robertmaxrees> really funky api.
[13:08:37] <taplar> moment handles all that crap for you
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> date math is especially weird.
[13:09:47] <alturic> Yea, I mean I can get UTC, I can get data, hell I can format it, but getting 2 hours ago is a pita.
[13:10:05] <taplar> if you want to do it vanilla, i'd say convert it to long and then do your math
[13:10:21] <robertmaxrees> or d.getHours() - 2
[13:10:41] <taplar> how does that work if it's 01:00 ?
[13:10:55] <robertmaxrees> the date object will handle the day conversion for you.
[13:10:58] <taplar> cool
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/80ag98h0/
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> but if you're really going to do much with dates, I'd really suggest moment.js
[13:14:54] <alturic> I think I'm going to try moment, see what happens.
[13:22:53] * taplar sings some kelly clarkson
[13:24:16] <ironbeard> I have a JSON object that's a list of dictionaries, each dictionary has a 'pk' identifier. If I know the pk of the dictionary I want, do I still have to loop through the list to get that dictionary?
[13:24:43] <taplar> yep
[13:25:20] <taplar> assuming your saying your structure is [ { pk: '...' }, { pk: '...' }]
[13:25:28] <ironbeard> taplar: Fair enough. I guess the serializer that's giving me the JSON is the lame part. Thanks :)
[13:26:05] <taplar> you can do a filter though, instead of a for each
[15:57:24] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[15:59:45] <arc_> is this robertmaxrees http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/weeee
[16:00:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[16:00:40] <robertmaxrees> i was just reminded of that video a week ago.
[16:01:04] <arc_> probably because you say that so much :p
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> hah, nah - i said something about "strife" and immediately my head went to the whole "gonads and strife" bit./
[16:02:36] <arc_> lol
[16:25:00] <lttg> Am I in the right place to ask a question about jquery ajax docs?
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:26:22] <lttg> thx. I'm a tinkerer, not an experienced developer. Spent about an hour today getting $.ajax to work. Was trying for POST and using jsonp because of cross-domain.
[16:26:51] <lttg> What I think I figured out is that jsonp forces a GET, but unless I missed it, this is not clear in the docs.
[16:28:30] <lttg> So, method was set to 'POST' but in dev console, it was getting forced to GET. I tinkered with the settings in .ajax. crossDomain: true was fine, but dataType: 'jsonp' consistently changed POST to GET.
[16:28:36] <shoky> lttg: jsonp forces a <script> element to be added to the DOM.  and <script>'s are fetched via GET yes..
[16:29:00] <shoky> lttg: jsonp is a hack that cannot be used like normal ajax
[16:29:28] <lttg> Ok, so... is this worth submitting a change request for the documentation? I feel like there are a lot of questions on SO and other places about this, and it took me about an hour to find a post that said jsonp is always GET.
[16:29:32] <shoky> there is no such thing as POST jsonp.  also setting crossDomain is not something you're supposed to do
[16:29:51] <shoky> no, it's not jquery's docs purpose to explain what jsonp is really :|
[16:30:29] <lttg> so don't use the crossDomain setting?
[16:30:42] <shoky> and the docs link to another site about jsonp
[16:32:02] <shoky> sorry, not fully true what i said about crossDomain option, i guess
[16:32:16] <shoky> but.. no don't use it
[16:32:28] <lttg> I am confused. I am looking at the 'method' setting on the jquery.ajax page. It's a short entry: The HTTP method to use for the request (e.g. "POST", "GET", "PUT").
[16:33:24] <shoky> "For more information on JSONP, see the original post detailing its use."
[16:34:08] <shoky> if you really want to.. go ahead and submit a change request ;p
[16:35:09] <shoky> but uhh. you're using dataType: 'jsonp'  so you need to obviously look at the docs for that as well
[16:35:29] <shoky> and they are:  "jsonp": Loads in a JSON block using JSONP     with a link to jsonp explanation
[16:35:42] <shoky> so docs seem fine to me
[16:35:42] <lttg> I am reading that block you referenced.
[16:36:12] <shoky> if you don't know what jsonp is or does, then you shouldn't be using it
[16:41:04] <shoky> and most likely the server you're trying to access doesn't even support jsonp
[16:41:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:41:15] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty common thing.
[16:42:05] <lttg> Thank you for your opinion. I read the section you referenced, and it discusses the callback function, but I don't see an explicit statement of overriding method.
[16:42:40] <robertmaxrees> overriding method as in the http method?
[16:44:39] <shoky> yea. they tried to do a POST jsonp and are dismayed that it "turns into" a GET ;p
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the very nature of jsonp would suggest that you can't use it to post.
[16:45:48] <lttg> I prefaced this by saying that I am not an experienced developer, so you could chill out a bit. There are a ton of SO questions about similar issues, so I'm not alone in this.
[16:46:02] <taplar> :)
[16:46:07] <robertmaxrees> "you could chill out a bit"?
[16:46:34] <arc_> lttg may i ask why you want it to be POST
[16:46:40] <shoky> i apologize for my portrayal of your dismay
[16:46:59] <robertmaxrees> i can see where the confusion might be, but the docs are really for jquery - they link to the docs for JSONP and JSON where appropriate.  not really sure what else they should do.
[16:47:40] <arc_> the purpose of jsonp is to do cross-site requests, so POST seems like the opposite of the point
[16:47:44] <lttg> I have a js client running from a static page that is trying to access a local server
[16:47:46] <shoky> i suppose they could link to a better article explaining JSONP better/simpler
[16:47:52] <lttg> the port number is causing cross-domain errors
[16:47:55] <lttg> I got it all working
[16:48:11] <lttg> but thought it might be worth saving other noobs the trouble
[16:48:23] <robertmaxrees> you can feel free to submit something to the docs repo.
[16:48:25] <lttg> a single line added to the method section of the docs...
[16:48:44] <shoky> lttg if it's your server that you're trying to access then you should go for the CORS solution, not a hack like jsonp
[16:48:44] <robertmaxrees> but the very nature of JSONP would suggest that it can't be anything other than a GET (shrug)
[16:49:14] <shoky> (and if you do want to still do jsonp - you have to explicitly configure your server to enable it..)
[16:49:16] <lttg> I agree with that now that I've earned the knowledge after an hour of googling
[16:49:42] <robertmaxrees> lttg i'm getting a really combative vibe off of you - we're not saying you're wrong, just providing a viewpoint.
[16:49:48] <lttg> I've configured the server to support it, getting a complete transaction cycle.
[16:49:59] <lttg> That's probably my writing style. My apologies.
[16:51:57] <lttg> When I read this:
[16:51:58] <lttg> The HTTP method to use for the request (e.g. "POST", "GET", "PUT").
[16:52:17] <iDentity1337> Guys, I need some help. I'm trying to get some data from an API (JSON), but CORS striked me. So I added 'callback=?' to the URL, now Unexpected Token : strikes me
[16:52:43] <lttg> I feel like it would be very helpful to say right after something like: setting dataType to 'jsonp' will force a GET regardless of 'method' setting. Making the implicit explicit
[16:53:05] <shoky> jsonp does a lot more than just force a GET though
[16:53:45] <shoky> that's just one consequence
[16:53:58] <shoky> again - you opted to use jsonp - knowing what jsonp is is on you
[16:54:55] <iDentity1337> any help?
[16:55:34] <taplar> unexpected token, like a parse error of the results?
[16:55:51] <shoky> iDentity1337: adding callback=?  is for making a JSONP request
[16:56:07] <shoky> iDentity1337: the server has to explicitly support that.. it won't just magically work.
[16:56:46] <iDentity1337> well dumbasses didn't make their API cross-origin, so now I gotta figure it out myself
[16:56:49] <shoky> taplar they're getting that because the server is not responding with a JSONP formatted response
[16:56:52] <shoky> (i.e. javascript)
[16:56:58] <taplar> ah
[16:57:03] <iDentity1337> it's returning pure JSON
[16:57:16] <shoky> iDentity1337: if they didnt enable it, then you can't do it from the client
[16:57:17] <iDentity1337> but I can't access it with GET
[16:58:35] <arc_> sigh
[17:04:39] <iDentity1337> Oh well :|
[17:05:03] <iDentity1337> No luck from my side, if someone wants to try on their, here's the API link: http://api.gametracker.rs/demo/json/server_info/193.192.59.162:27038
[17:05:34] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[17:06:30] <shoky> iDentity1337: doesn't seem that they support either CORS or JSONP, so yah you can't access it from the client
[17:06:45] <shoky> do they have docs?
[17:06:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:07:04] <iDentity1337> this is their docs (ikr) : http://api.gametracker.rs/
[17:07:11] <iDentity1337> it's just examples of calling the api
[17:07:31] <shoky> yea.. not helpful :)
[17:07:41] <iDentity1337> could PHP make the call ?
[17:07:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:07:46] <robertmaxrees> server-side could.
[17:08:25] <iDentity1337> But I want my loven AJAX
[17:08:43] <taplar> shoot them an email telling them about their CORS issue
[17:08:51] <iDentity1337> will do.
[17:09:28] <morenoh149> hello
[17:09:44] <morenoh149> has anyone fiddled with classList.add and jquery?
[17:10:15] <morenoh149> I'm doing $().sidebar('toggle') as shown here http://semantic-ui.com/modules/sidebar.html#/definition
[17:10:31] <morenoh149> but I would like to add a classname before the togggle and remove it after the toggle.
[17:10:36] <morenoh149> How can I do this?
[17:12:43] <taplar> there are some callbacks under the settings tab
[17:16:19] <morenoh149> taplar: so is it likely classList.add()/remove() were executing before $().toggle() finished?
[17:16:31] <morenoh149> I'm also trying to understand jquery
[17:16:41] <taplar> what exactly were you trying?
[17:17:01] <morenoh149> add a classname, perform jquery, remove classname
[17:17:17] <taplar> do you have a fiddle with your attempt?
[17:19:54] <morenoh149> are jquery operations synchronous?
[17:20:03] <robertmaxrees> depends on which you're talking about.
[17:20:11] <morenoh149> is there a table?
[17:20:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:20:31] <taplar> unless there is an animation or an ajax involved, assume sync
[17:20:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:20:48] <morenoh149> mmm the toggle is an animation
[17:21:08] <taplar> yep, so if you are trying to remove the class after the toggle it would execute before it finishes
[17:21:13] <taplar> thus those callbacks the api provides
[17:29:45] <morenoh149> how would the callback be defined? $.fn.sidebar.onVisible = () => console.log('visible') ?
[17:30:09] <robertmaxrees> which jquery function?
[17:30:20] <taplar> i'm not familiar with the plugin, but i assume it would be provided when you do the toggle
[17:31:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jillix.github.io/jQuery-sidebar/ this one?
[17:31:35] <morenoh149> http://semantic-ui.com/modules/sidebar.html#/usage robertmaxrees
[17:32:06] <taplar> .sidebar('behavior name', argumentOne, argumentTwo) <-- not sure if the callback would go in arg1 or arg2
[17:32:14] <taplar> it's not very clear to me, :s
[17:32:20] <morenoh149> damn
[17:32:21] <robertmaxrees> "attach events(selector, event)"
[17:32:32] <morenoh149> I'm not too experienced w jquery either
[17:32:37] <robertmaxrees> maybe that?
[17:32:46] <morenoh149> >     $('#sidebar-navigation').sidebar('toggle').onVisible = () => console.log('visible!')
[17:32:49] <morenoh149> doesn't work
[17:33:00] <morenoh149> but     $('#sidebar-navigation').sidebar('toggle') works
[17:33:01] <robertmaxrees> right, because that's not the syntax for registering a callback.
[17:33:44] <morenoh149>      $('#sidebar-navigation').sidebar('onVisible', () => console.log('foo')) ?
[17:33:51] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[17:34:16] <robertmaxrees> http://semantic-ui.com/modules/sidebar.html#triggering-showhide-with-other-content
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> here you go.

[20:31:43] <z1haze> any backbone users in here who can explain how to structure an app for me? all of these little todomvc application examples dont really explain how to make an application of any size
[20:32:05] <z1haze> for example, how do you do the navigation, is it a view in itself or no?
[20:38:48] <StoBrendo> hi there do anyone know if there is a function to free any focus from any input?
[20:39:43] <StoBrendo> i've tried even $('*').focusout();
[21:06:53] <z1haze> StoBrendo, try blur()
[21:07:17] <StoBrendo> z1haze: ok thanks

[22:46:19] <jose3_> I have a question about dom manipulation
[22:46:46] <jose3_> suppose I have two divs: X Y that are both text-centered
[22:47:17] <jose3_> is there a way to remove x without Y immediately getting centered. Can I make it transition to its center location smoothly?
[23:05:31] <int-main> I am updating my page using $(body).load("xyz") but I am getting error in console Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated
[23:51:11] <jose3_> hello
