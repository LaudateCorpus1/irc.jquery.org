[00:11:17] <zumba_addict> why am I getting an error "parent is not a function" on this code - let parent = $('.playerModule').parent();
[00:15:58] <rcyr> Because you need to load jquery before using it :(
[00:39:31] <zumba_addict> hi rcyr, just saw your message
[00:39:50] <zumba_addict> we're using Jquery npm module
[00:40:13] <zumba_addict> looks like its not a full blown jquery
[00:41:12] <zumba_addict> looking at our package.json, the version matches this one - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery
[00:41:32] <rcyr> Ha
[00:43:24] <zumba_addict> any suggestions?
[00:43:24] <zizzl> Hey anyone know of a plugin that will allow me to use images to replace a checkbox so I can create my own?
[00:46:19] <zumba_addict> If you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the Developing jQuery Core forum or in #jquery on irc.freenode.net.
[00:46:24] <zumba_addict> :D
[00:47:06] <zumba_addict> this webpack, es6 is such a pita
[01:04:11] <zumba_addict> oh wow, if in debug mode, the $ won't work. But if I turn of debugging, it works
[01:29:26] <Cork> zizzl: like i told you yesterday, just set the image in a label
[01:29:37] <Cork> zizzl: no need for javascript, css can do it just fine
[01:34:16] <Cork> zizzl: thrown together, but it should give you the concept http://jsfiddle.net/da71esja/
[01:36:13] <zizzl> Cork I think mine didn't work because I have <input><br><label> ... using a WordPress plugin unfortunately
[01:36:33] <Cork> zizzl: so change the css selector
[01:37:02] <Cork> input[type="checkbox"] + br { display: none; }
[01:37:18] <Cork> and input[type="checkbox"] + br + label { /* same as before */ } should solve that
[01:40:34] <zizzl> Thanks Cork
[02:16:54] <z1haze> is there anyway in jquery for use load() without specifying the target or whatever its called
[02:17:10] <z1haze> like can i just say load there right where i call the script
[03:35:07] <Cork> z1haze: no, cause javascript dom doesn't work like that
[03:35:37] <Cork> z1haze: think of javascript as running completely separate from the html
[03:35:52] <Cork> z1haze: and then you locate where in the dom tree you want to do things
[03:36:08] <z1haze> i understand
[03:36:37] <z1haze> if i include a script with script src= and in the script i do document.write .. does that write directly where i import the script
[03:36:57] <Cork> z1haze: you can do something like <script id="something">$.get(url).done(function(data) { $('#something').after(data); });</script>
[03:37:22] <Cork> z1haze: kinda, but you should avoid document.write
[03:37:32] <z1haze> why avoid that?
[03:37:36] <Cork> z1haze: document.write is a VERY old deprecated feature
[03:37:51] <Cork> and depending on when this code runs it might blow away the entire page
[03:37:53] <z1haze> why is it depracated
[03:38:06] <Cork> cause it is buggy and not compatible with the dom
[03:38:17] <Cork> document.write was added before dom was speced
[03:38:29] <Cork> (it is a dom0 function)
[03:38:38] <z1haze> well i tried using jquery to append my html
[03:38:44] <z1haze> but that didnt work for some reason
[03:38:47] <Cork> so browsers has to do a ton of hacks trying to get it to work somewhat
[03:39:10] <Cork> did you try what i just gave you?
[03:39:23] <z1haze> the url is external i cant get external urls
[03:39:39] <Cork> ah, ya cors isn't allowed unless the server explicitly allow it
[03:39:44] <Cork> you would have to use <iframe> there
[03:39:59] <z1haze> im building this site for a guy using the enjin platform, its a gamer based community website thing
[03:40:10] <z1haze> have you heard of ejin
[03:40:13] <z1haze> enjin*
[03:40:33] <z1haze> basically its all point and click ready to go stuff, modules built in.. it reminds me of phpnuke from back in the early days
[03:41:29] <z1haze> anyway, you can create 'html' modules and dump or own code into it, but i want a way to just include my code that i wrote from remote sources, so i can use/reuse the same code if need be without having to keep redoing it, plus i like to keep all my files safe and sound on my server
[03:41:43] <Cork> you can't
[03:42:01] <Cork> unless the remote source explicitly allow the browser to let the cors call through
[03:42:14] <Cork> (it has to state it in a http header)
[04:17:26] <hellyeah> yo
[04:17:48] <hellyeah> i know it is simple question may be kind of low level profile question but still learning stuff tho.
[04:18:09] <hellyeah> i try to add delegation to the button when button is click i expect messageChecker is invoked
[04:18:17] <hellyeah> what is my mistake here https://jsfiddle.net/9noekr2k/2/
[04:40:02] <JyZyXEL> where can i view the source code for jquerys implementation of isNumeric()?
[04:46:22] <JyZyXEL> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L211 found it!
[04:59:13] <Mandevil\splat> Hello. I've just found that trigger('remove') on any element in my DOM will remove that element.
[04:59:29] <Mandevil\splat> Is that some kind of default behaviour or something?
[04:59:35] <Mandevil\splat> I don't have any custome 'remove' handler.
[05:00:08] <Cork> O_o
[05:02:24] <Mandevil\splat> How can I find where the handler is in Firebug?
[05:05:36] <Mandevil\splat> Utter mystery... I can't see that remove handler anywhere.
[05:06:09] <Cork> Mandevil\splat: wow very interesting
[05:07:09] <Mandevil\splat> $('body').trigger('remove') --> removes the whole page...
[05:07:17] <Cork> Mandevil\splat: it is part of jQuery.event.trigger
[05:07:31] <Cork> if it doesn't find any jquery handler
[05:07:42] <Cork> it does elm[eventName]()
[05:08:00] <Cork> so $('body').trigger('remove') becomes $('body')[0].remove()
[05:08:05] <Mandevil\splat> Uh.
[05:08:10] <Mandevil\splat> What's the purpose of this?
[05:08:13] <Cork> this is completely new to me
[05:08:16] <Cork> i donno
[05:08:50] <xec> wow, that is funky
[05:08:58] <Mandevil\splat> At any rate thanks for enlightening me.
[05:09:03] <Mandevil\splat> Because this is very confusing.
[05:09:42] <Cork> Mandevil\splat: it is the code that triggers the default action on an element
[05:10:07] <Cork> and ya, this looks like an unintended side effect
[05:10:30] <Mandevil\splat> Hm, no one ever ran into this?
[05:11:00] <xec> i guess most people try to trigger actual events :)
[05:11:12] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event/trigger.js#L137
[05:11:19] <Cork> that is the line causing it
[05:11:24] <Cork> and it is still pressent in 3.x
[05:12:00] <Cork> Mandevil\splat: i try to avoid fake events as long as it is possible
[05:12:10] <Mandevil\splat> Cork: "Fake events"?
[05:12:10] <Cork> but ya, this really sounds like a weird case
[05:12:16] <Cork> remove isn't a dom event
[05:12:21] <Cork> hence a fake event
[05:12:36] <Mandevil\splat> Cork: It was custom event I was implementing.
[05:12:39] <Cork> (commonly refered to as custom event)
[05:12:47] <Cork> heh :)
[05:12:50] <Cork> as i said
[05:12:57] <Mandevil\splat> I guess I just forgot "return false;"
[05:13:44] <Cork> ugg, no don't use return false
[05:13:50] <Cork> use event.preventDefault()
[05:13:54] <Cork> never return false;
[05:14:08] <Mandevil\splat> Hm, ok.
[05:14:22] <Mandevil\splat> You mean, function(event) { event.preventDefault(): } ?
[05:14:25] <Cork> return false; kills the event so other event handlers can't use it
[05:14:26] <Cork> yes
[05:14:42] <Mandevil\splat> OK, thanks for correcting me :)
[05:14:43] <Cork> event.preventDefault() stops the "browser default action" but leaves it for js
[05:16:22] <Mandevil\splat> Yeah, stuff works now. Thanks for your help!
[05:17:11] <d3m0n> Is it possible to do a selector like this? :not([data-filter="green"])
[05:17:39] <d3m0n> I know this code doesnt work but I mean something similar
[05:17:43] <Mandevil\splat> Can't you use [data-filter^="green"]?
[05:18:57] <Mandevil\splat> Actually it's [data-filter!="green"]?
[05:18:58] <Cork> d3m0n: yes you can
[05:19:21] <d3m0n> Seems I have to attach an element to it
[05:19:29] <d3m0n> to the :not
[05:19:48] <Cork> d3m0n: what are you trying to do?
[05:19:58] <d3m0n> Hide everything but
[05:20:01] <d3m0n> that ele
[05:20:23] <xec> d3m0n: :not([data-filter="green"]) will select every element on the page that doesnt have green filter
[05:20:23] <Cork> a correct line would be something like $('#group li').not('[data-filter="green"]').hide()
[05:20:38] <Cork> you don't want to select everything based on an attribute
[05:20:40] <Cork> it is very slow
[05:20:42] <d3m0n> xec: You woul think but it doesnt
[05:20:57] <d3m0n> http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/bVOGOX
[05:21:04] <Cork> d3m0n: if you really need to go through the entire page, you should use a class instead
[05:21:27] <d3m0n> Well it would be the same thought process
[05:21:31] <d3m0n> Everything BUT the class
[05:21:41] <xec> d3m0n; it does actually
[05:21:45] <Cork> except that is faster
[05:22:02] <xec> d3m0n: you're hiding <body> for instance, because it doesnt have green filter...
[05:22:07] <Cork> $(':not(.filter-green)') isn't splendid, but ok
[05:22:20] <Cork> ya, that problem too
[05:22:20] <d3m0n> xec: ahh ok
[05:22:28] <d3m0n> Makes sense
[05:23:02] <Cork> d3m0n: what you could do is something like $('*').not($('.filter-green').parents()).hide()
[05:23:14] <xec> you could do [data-filter][data-filter!="green"]
[05:23:16] <Cork> not super good either, but a possible option
[05:23:30] <xec> to make sure you're only selecting elements that have that attribute
[05:23:45] <Cork> make it two classes in that case >_>
[05:23:56] <Cork> $('.filter:not(.green)')
[05:24:10] <Cork> +
[05:24:13] <Cork> opps
[05:24:17] <xec> d3m0n: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvyxXm
[05:24:33] <d3m0n> Cork yeah
[05:24:40] <d3m0n> I might just do that
[05:24:48] <d3m0n> esp if its the fastest way
[05:24:56] <Cork> really classes is what you want to use if you want to select groups of elements
[05:25:07] <Cork> it is explicitly why it was added to the html/dom spec
[05:25:13] <d3m0n> ALso thanks xec thats cool i never knew you could combine them like tat
[05:25:18] <xec> but yeah, i agree with Cork
[05:25:43] <d3m0n> Thanks guys
[05:25:46] <d3m0n> Ill go ahead and do that
[05:31:18] <d3m0n> http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/bVOGOX there we go
[05:31:32] <d3m0n> Thanks again guys
[05:32:51] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Can anyone help me with "picturefill" please?
[05:50:34] <Ice_Strike> Is there a way to get a text width?
[06:06:49] <Duikb00t> Hi there, is there a better way then doing this? http://paste.ee/p/Fb0Pn
[06:07:19] <Duikb00t> Or should I write all my code for having a responsive site with js features in the resize handler?
[06:08:29] <Uhkis> use a responsive slider and css
[06:09:11] <Duikb00t> So not bx slider?
[06:09:38] <Duikb00t> Seems someone made a version '4' https://github.com/stevenwanderski/bxslider-4
[06:10:15] <Uhkis> flex and owl are responsive iirc
[06:10:27] <Duikb00t> ok cthx
[06:34:43] <wangxm> why
[06:38:09] <midori-rus> Hello could anybody help me to understand how to use OR operator in datatables?
[06:45:27] <hellyeah> hey
[06:45:28] <hellyeah> yeah i got it return false provide me to exit the function. I wanna show message text if any of the button has orange color. In this example i have 30 buttons .the function works good if first button has orange color. But i haveto generalize this approach. Any suggestion here  line 22-39 http://jsfiddle.net/1qgqz4mv/63/
[06:47:41] <hellyeah> guess solved the issue
[06:48:02] <hellyeah> solved the issue it seems
[07:25:32] <Ice_Strike> using jquery, how to select value 2 and 3 from multiple list box?
[07:27:55] <hellyeah> can you do a fiddle?
[07:28:01] <hellyeah> minimal fiddle may be
[07:34:40] <taplar> Ice_Strike: are you talking about a select with a size greater than 1?
[07:35:57] <Cork> ya, can't be much else
[07:36:02] <Ice_Strike> hellyeah http://jsfiddle.net/v193b4rm/1/  I would like Team 1 and Team 2 to be selected when the page load and then it need to execute $("#team).trigger("change"), once that is then then $(".button).trigger("click")
[07:37:22] <Cork> Ice_Strike: you would have to query the option and set prop('selected', true=
[07:37:24] <Cork> *)
[07:37:48] <Ice_Strike> Ah
[07:38:06] <Cork> that isn't needed for normal select
[07:38:08] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/v193b4rm/2/ for starters
[07:38:13] <Cork> but that is the simplest solution for multi
[07:38:26] <hellyeah> taplar: i try different way this is my development here http://jsfiddle.net/1qgqz4mv/81/
[07:39:04] <taplar> hellyeah: ok... ?
[07:39:09] <hellyeah> ye
[07:39:31] <hellyeah> but warning messagwe will appear only
[07:39:40] <hellyeah> if button has certain color
[07:39:52] <hellyeah> when you click button it will check for colored button
[07:40:03] <hellyeah> if there is nolored button message diseppear
[07:40:05] <hellyeah> it is nice
[07:40:08] <Ice_Strike> taplar I see, then how to execute $("#team).trigger("change") after it has been selected?
[07:40:35] <taplar> you can just call it afterwards
[07:40:41] <taplar> off of $teams
[07:41:15] <Cork> Ice_Strike: http://jsfiddle.net/v193b4rm/4/
[07:41:21] <robhol> ... deciding logic based on color seems kind of questionable
[07:41:36] <robhol> sounds like you have some issues with the semantics in that code
[07:45:39] <taplar> hellyeah: wait, are you saying it the button that has a green background is clicked then the message will go away?
[07:46:35] <taplar> cause that doesn't seem to be working if so
[07:47:44] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:47:46] <hellyeah> just a sec
[07:47:57] <hellyeah> check this one http://jsfiddle.net/1qgqz4mv/83/
[07:48:09] <hellyeah> i do that thing just for orange button
[07:48:10] <taplar> you can click the button to see if it working, lol
[07:48:20] <hellyeah> ica be red, green, orange, gray, blue
[07:50:39] <taplar> another thing to point out.  you have a 'hidden' class, but your only using it in one part
[07:50:49] <taplar> other places your checking the css display
[07:50:56] <taplar> seems inconsistent
[07:51:56] <hellyeah> hidden i didnt decide i will use or not
[07:52:04] <hellyeah> when you click arrow button
[07:52:16] <hellyeah> div is expanded and warning message is hidden
[07:52:26] <hellyeah> i dont know i should use that approach or not
[07:52:34] <hellyeah> well
[07:52:42] <hellyeah> i am checking css display because
[07:52:55] <hellyeah> when you click the button şit will be hided
[07:53:02] <hellyeah> but hidden button still in the dom
[07:53:18] <hellyeah> so i just tell to js dont check display:hidden button
[07:53:24] <hellyeah> because it is not there
[07:53:43] <hellyeah> dont worry about it check if any other colored button is there
[07:54:02] <taplar> right, what i'm saying is if you wanted to be a little more consistent instead of hide() and show() you could addClass('hidden'), removeClass('hidden') and filter('.hidden') instead of checking the css directly
[07:54:10] <hellyeah> hope
[07:54:15] <hellyeah> yuou understand what i meant
[07:54:21] <hellyeah> i dont trust my english muıch
[07:54:44] <hellyeah> let me note it
[07:55:01] <hellyeah> when uyou said inconsistent
[07:55:09] <hellyeah> i supposed you said "non sense"
[07:55:15] <taplar> no
[07:55:17] <taplar> um
[07:55:22] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[07:55:26] <taplar> lol, crap, making me think of a synonym
[07:55:39] <taplar> different
[07:55:49] <taplar> not the same
[07:56:19] <hellyeah> okey i will check that you said
[07:56:28] <hellyeah> after taking some break
[07:56:28] <taplar> it's just a little thing, both work
[07:56:29] <hellyeah> brb
[07:56:35] <xec> those are antonyms?
[07:56:40] <taplar> just seeing it all together can kinda make you wonder why the difference is there
[07:56:52] <taplar> nooooo, lol, not another word
[07:57:27] <taplar> looks like antonym is the opposite of synonym
[07:57:33] <taplar> so i meant synonym
[07:57:55] <xec> but surely, "consistent" doesn't mean "different"?
[07:58:01] <taplar> inconsistent
[07:58:28] <xec> lol. right.
[07:59:05] <xec> you said consistent, he said inconsistent, and it got confusing
[07:59:22] <taplar> [06:50] <taplar> seems inconsistent
[07:59:49] <xec> 13:54:02 <taplar> right, what i'm saying is if you wanted to be a little more consistent ....
[08:00:06] <taplar> uh huh... ? :D
[08:00:23] <xec> nevermind
[08:00:46] <xec> as long as you two understand each other I'm gonna step back :)
[08:01:41] <taplar> hey if i'm being confusing definately let me know.  i'm just not seeing it right now
[08:02:12] <taplar> definitely
[08:02:15] <taplar> blah
[08:19:47] <hellyeah> taplar: do you mean something like that? http://jsfiddle.net/1qgqz4mv/87/
[08:20:38] <taplar> close, the show() would be removeClass('hidden')
[08:20:47] <taplar> and for the if you can use hasClass('hidden') to get a boolean
[08:21:25] <Duikb00t> Anyone worked with this? https://github.com/pixelcog/parallax.js/
[08:21:37] <taplar> filter was more for line 44
[08:24:32] <hellyeah> i suppose
[08:24:48] <hellyeah> filter will find button that has hidden value as class
[08:25:05] <Duikb00t> By using the example from their website (  parallax ) i just see no image appear :(
[08:25:27] <hello9> anyone ever fill out a browser based authentication popup with jquery/ajax?
[08:25:53] <hellyeah> but iif i dont use hide and show
[08:25:57] <hellyeah> i cannot get animation
[08:26:15] <hellyeah> hide and show give you animation with duration parameter
[08:26:27] <taplar> ah
[08:26:33] <robhol> hello9: uh.. browser based as in the window the browser shows you on Basic auth etc?
[08:26:41] <hello9> @robhol yep
[08:26:48] <robhol> That can't be done in js
[08:27:39] <Duikb00t> Some suggestion for a god parallax tool for js
[08:27:42] <robhol> what are you trying to do?
[08:34:25] <hellyeah> taplar: probably you wonder why i try to use animatrion
[08:34:55] <taplar> hellyeah: i was actually trying to see if transition would work with display, but doesn't seem to want to
[08:35:17] <hellyeah> ic
[08:35:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:35:52] <taplar> ah
[08:35:53] <taplar> hold on
[08:35:57] <hellyeah> you mean when it is not display:noe
[08:35:59] <hellyeah> none
[08:36:06] <hello9> @robhol can it be done from the server?
[08:36:16] <hellyeah> okay
[08:36:32] <robhol> I get the feeling we're XY-ing hard here :p
[08:36:43] <robhol> What are you actually trying to do?
[08:37:24] <hello9> Long story short, there is an external site that I'm trying to embed in an iframe, and want to skip the auth popup (i.e login and start the session without the user being bothered)
[08:37:30] <taplar> hellyeah: why do you have your .buttonClass defined twice in your css?
[08:37:55] <hello9> @robhol since the auth popup isnt basic i cant just stick username:password@url on it
[08:38:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:38:22] <hellyeah> just the mistake i did in hurry i guess
[08:38:39] <hellyeah> i checked word-spacing works for the letter inside the button
[08:38:44] <hellyeah> appearently it doesnt work
[08:39:08] <robhol> hello9: take a step back. Not the filling in stuff, not the url stuff, but the thing you're actually trying to do that got you started down that line :p
[08:39:15] <taplar> hellyeah: there's a visibility option that you might checkout for transitions  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3331353/transitions-on-the-display-property
[08:39:53] <hellyeah> sure thanks
[08:40:49] <hellyeah> so
[08:41:03] <hellyeah> it can be used instead of hide() and get animation cool
[08:41:14] <taplar> possibly, yeah
[08:41:20] <hellyeah> taplar: does it bother you to use hide()
[08:41:26] <hellyeah> or show()
[08:41:31] <hellyeah> is it depreceated?
[08:41:37] <taplar> no, just the mixing of show and hide and a hidden class
[08:41:52] <hellyeah> humm okey i will take a look
[08:42:11] <hellyeah> btw today i heard button.click(function() is depreceated
[08:42:19] <taplar> is it?
[08:42:23] <hellyeah> button.on('click', function() is preferred
[08:42:32] <taplar> i knew that, but didn't know it was deprecated
[08:42:33] <hellyeah> i dont know exactly but someone told me
[08:43:00] <hellyeah> wondering why something is deprecated actually
[08:43:07] <taplar> doesn't say it is on the docs
[08:43:07] <hellyeah> is it because of version switch
[08:43:12] <hellyeah> or security reason
[08:43:21] <hellyeah> or performance problems hmm
[08:43:28] <taplar> click is a wrapper for on()
[08:43:39] <taplar> but if you use on() you can easily switch to the delegate version
[08:43:41] <hellyeah> on() is just syntatic sugar?
[08:43:44] <taplar> no
[08:43:48] <taplar> on() is the workhorse
[08:43:53] <taplar> click() is wrapper
[08:43:58] <hellyeah> humm btw if you check code
[08:44:03] <hellyeah> i used delegate also
[08:44:09] <hellyeah> to invoke method
[08:44:10] <robhol> I thought "delegate" was .NET lingo :p
[08:44:18] <taplar> nah
[08:44:22] <hellyeah> what is lingo mean
[08:44:23] <taplar> and where hellyeah ?
[08:44:34] <hellyeah> ops
[08:44:38] <hellyeah> sorry i changed it
[08:44:41] <taplar> language specific to a given subject = lingo
[08:44:44] <hellyeah> first try to us e delegate
[08:44:52] <hellyeah> then i changed it to callback function
[08:45:10] <hellyeah> line 45
[08:45:18] <hellyeah> callback function of hidden
[08:45:21] <hellyeah> ops hide()
[08:45:26] <taplar> yeah, just a callback, not a delegate
[08:46:50] <hellyeah> i tried to handle this
[08:46:56] <hellyeah> delegate first
[08:46:58] <hellyeah> anyway
[08:47:08] <hellyeah> callback function is like do this and do that
[08:47:15] <hellyeah> "do that" is callback function
[08:47:19] <hellyeah> can i think like that
[08:47:35] <taplar> it's a function definition
[08:47:51] <hellyeah> for example hide(duration, function()
[08:48:10] <taplar> yup.  do something, then do callback
[08:48:16] <hellyeah> function is callback function
[08:48:17] <taplar> but that's not always the case
[08:48:26] <hellyeah> right first hide the element then callback
[08:48:28] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:48:31] <hellyeah> humm
[08:48:32] <taplar> like for ajax calls and their success, fail, complete callbacks
[08:48:45] <hellyeah> i think first ajax is done
[08:48:51] <taplar> that's also a then do, but what to then do is more complex
[08:48:56] <hellyeah> i mean parsing url address etc.
[08:49:03] <hellyeah> then do success, failure, callback
[08:49:13] <taplar> but it's an or in that case
[08:49:18] <hellyeah> i didnt use then yuet
[08:49:31] <hellyeah> an or in ?= what do you mean?
[08:49:44] <taplar> it doesn't do success and failure and callback
[08:49:47] <taplar> it does one of them
[08:50:00] <taplar> or two if you have complete in there also
[08:50:03] <hellyeah> as a sequence right
[08:50:08] <taplar> no
[08:50:09] <hellyeah> because it is async call
[08:50:11] <taplar> conditional
[08:50:14] <hellyeah> it is singe thread
[08:50:16] <taplar> err
[08:50:19] <hellyeah> single*
[08:50:32] <hellyeah> may be i am wrong
[08:50:36] <hellyeah> js is single thread
[08:50:42] <hellyeah> it is sync language
[08:50:48] <hellyeah> so async is not single threaded
[08:50:58] <taplar> could be, doesn't have to be
[08:51:12] <hellyeah> js can be multi threaded?
[08:51:18] <taplar> you can have workers
[08:51:21] <taplar> iirc
[08:51:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:51:35] <hellyeah> thats new
[08:51:56] <hellyeah> workers you mean there is a main thread
[08:51:57] <taplar> crap, my laptop is forcing reboot.  bbs
[08:52:08] <hellyeah> okey
[08:52:09] <taplar> google javascript workers.  it's an object thing iirc
[08:52:19] <hellyeah> i will check
[08:53:19] <hellyeah> okey i will add a feature
[08:53:25] <hellyeah> may be you like i will see
[08:58:31] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:58:46] <hellyeah> hey
[09:04:22] <rindolf> hellyeah: sup?
[09:05:29] <hellyeah> not much
[09:05:33] <hellyeah> how about you?
[09:07:10] <rindolf> hellyeah: I'm sorting my bookmarks.
[09:07:34] <rindolf> hellyeah: and I ran into an annoying bug in X on MAgeia Cauldron.
[09:10:26] <PlanC> what's the best way to load an external SYNC JS script as an ASYNC?
[09:10:58] <PlanC> currently I've placed the SYNC tags in the bottom of the HTML document and once everything's loaded, I have jQuery move the contents up
[09:25:57] <EmmaBourbon> Morninh.
[09:28:56] <rindolf> EmmaBourbon: hi.
[09:29:00] <rindolf> EmmaBourbon: sup?
[09:29:25] <EmmaBourbon> not to much, hanging out. Hoping to learn some more jquery today.
[09:29:26] <hellyeah> rindolf: take your time, enjoy your stay xD
[09:29:39] <hellyeah> EmmaBourbon: what part of jquery
[09:29:48] <hellyeah> do you have any spesific topic today?
[09:30:09] <hellyeah> whatever you learn try to fiddle it
[09:30:34] <EmmaBourbon> Well, mostly just trying to get it to work. My JavaScript doesn't load or something. I've been working on it for a few days.
[09:30:42] <EmmaBourbon> I found jsfiddle the other day! It works just fine there.
[09:30:49] <EmmaBourbon> I think its Chrome.
[09:31:16] <hellyeah> did you check console?
[09:31:34] <hellyeah> i think chrome is the browser hanging out best with js
[09:32:04] <hellyeah> did you use $(document).ready
[09:32:13] <hellyeah> did you referrence your js at the end of bodt
[09:32:14] <hellyeah> y
[09:32:57] <hellyeah> brb
[09:36:16] <EmmaBourbon> i will get back to you on those things.
[09:57:06] <Twirl> hello, how can i select the second children? because i'm using ('selected').children().first().children...
[09:57:20] <Twirl> and i got a lot of children
[09:57:26] <Cork> Twirl: .children().eq(1)
[09:57:39] <Twirl> cool, ty
[09:57:43] <Cork> also you might want to use .each and loop them
[09:57:51] <Twirl> not this time
[09:58:46] <_Noobie_> I'm trying to target a div inside a modal.  I have two modals on the same page.  What would be the best way.  I'm currently doing $('.modal-body').append($holder);  But that calls all modals.
[09:59:54] <Cork> _Noobie_: well you could give it an id, or you could hold a reference from where it was created
[10:00:10] <Cork> or if it is located in different parts of the dom, you could use dom relation
[10:00:23] <_Noobie_> How would I do a reference?
[10:00:37] <Cork> depends on what you use to create the "modal"
[10:01:38] <_Noobie_> Well the modal is lives in the html even if the jquery doesnt' run.
[10:04:38] <Bheam> hi
[10:05:31] <Bheam> is there something i can do inside an event to return pretending i didn't do anything? IOS has some hardcoded events from CSS :hover, and if i interfere with these i change the behavior - i need to return from a function without telling IOS the event was even handled?
[10:05:49] <Bheam> i tried returning true or false but doesn't work the way i need :/
[10:06:07] <Bheam> any suggestions?
[10:13:21] <naschine> stop event propagation? I'm not quite sure I understood what you're trying to do though...
[11:03:43] <bojanlazic> How do I change this arrows with images https://jsfiddle.net/5uzjc8a6/1/ ?
[11:13:57] <Es0teric> how do i remove a class once a specific div is passed?
[11:14:29] <zzaichik> .removeClass()
[11:16:18] <Es0teric> no.. i mean when i scroll and i pass the end of a div called #pageContainer, i want to remove the class of a specific div, zzaichik
[11:18:24] <arc_> Bheam detect whether the device is using ios and unbind that event handler
[11:19:07] <hlvwrk> really easy tbh
[11:19:59] <Es0teric> hlvwrk are you talking to me?
[11:20:24] <hlvwrk> no, to Bheam.
[11:20:25] <johndoe2> Es0teric http://bfy.tw/2l4V :)
[11:20:56] <Es0teric> johndoe2 you dont have to be a dick about it
[11:21:01] <Es0teric> maybe i already did google it?
[11:21:08] <zzaichik> you're going to have to get the position of #pageContainer plus it's height, subtract that from window.scrollTop and when that number reaches zero, .removeClass()
[11:21:13] <johndoe2> Es0teric but it did provide you with what you needed right?
[11:22:01] <zzaichik> Yeah ^^ that's exactly what the first stackoverflow link says to do.
[11:22:02] <johndoe2> Es0teric googling something for you is actually being nice to you... at least in my part of the world.
[11:22:56] <Es0teric> zzaichik so the position would be $('#pageContainer')offset().top()
[11:22:56] <Es0teric> right?
[11:23:08] <Es0teric> * $('#pageContainer').offset().top()
[11:23:11] <decx> top is a property of offest not a method
[11:23:14] <zzaichik> offset().top
[11:23:26] <Es0teric> zzaichik gotcha
[11:23:49] <bojanlazic> How do I change this arrows with images https://jsfiddle.net/5uzjc8a6/1/ ?
[11:23:57] <decx> change the css
[11:26:01] <bojanlazic> not working
[11:26:48] <johndoe2> bojanlazic flexslider.css line 134 - the arrows are a icon font. I would it keep it an icon font rather than images - it looks much more crisp on retina devices for example, and it won't add yet another http request. But if you really want to change it, take out the font, and add your background image to .flex-prev and .flex-next respectively.
[11:27:29] <bojanlazic> johndoe2: thanks
[11:27:32] <decx> works fine https://jsfiddle.net/decx/5uzjc8a6/2/
[11:27:59] <johndoe2> kitty!
[11:28:17] <Es0teric> zzaichik i have this: var div_top = $('#packageRightRail').offset().top, containerItem = div_top + $('#packageRightRail').innerHeight() - $(window).scrollTop();
[11:28:33] <Es0teric> but it just gives me negative numbers
[11:28:52] <decx> look at this Es0teric http://jsfiddle.net/decx/srrxqg4x/
[11:28:56] <devslash> I want to have an event triggered whenever the user types text into a text field without waiting for the field to lose focus. which jQuery event would be best for this ? keypress,keyup or keydown ?
[11:29:26] <johndoe2> devslash I would use keyup
[11:29:40] <johndoe2> but that would trigger the event every time the person types 1 character
[11:31:26] <Es0teric> decx so that removes the class of the container if its greater than the position?
[11:31:30] <Es0teric> meaning its reaching the bottom, right?
[11:31:59] <decx> that's what it does
[11:36:29] <zzaichik> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/9begsLsL/1/
[11:37:15] <decx> you generally want to avoid doing these lookups inside the scroll event
[11:37:35] <zzaichik> yeah it's pretty demanding ^
[11:41:30] <zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/9begsLsL/2/
[11:41:50] <zzaichik> Es0teric: ^
[11:42:21] <decx> and only 13 minutes after i fiddled the same thing ^^
[11:42:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:42:32] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[11:47:40] <zzaichik> are people just in the mood to be dicks today or what?
[11:47:46] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[11:49:21] <Duikb00t> Some dodgy things are happeing for my BXslider
[11:49:31] <Duikb00t> For some reason it only shows up when I scale my window.
[11:49:46] <Duikb00t> Should I put it in a resize handler or something/
[11:50:07] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t without seeing your code there's no way to know what's going on.
[11:50:48] <Duikb00t> I can show the code but not a preview :s
[11:50:53] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[11:51:01] <robertmaxrees> i can almost guarantee that you don't need a resize handler - in fact, you probabl want the exact opposite.
[11:51:41] <Duikb00t> robertmaxrees http://paste.ee/p/nKM6G
[11:52:05] <robertmaxrees> errr, you could make a fiddle of this pretty easily.
[11:52:08] <Duikb00t> If you only want the html output
[11:52:17] <Duikb00t> i can setup that as well
[11:52:28] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, is this ALL of your JS?
[11:52:38] <Duikb00t> No :)
[11:52:41] <robertmaxrees> becuase then I'd wonder if you're in a document ready, what your css looks like, etc.
[11:53:25] <Duikb00t> The whole JS looks like: http://paste.ee/p/qyhwv
[11:54:09] <robertmaxrees> what's with the nested document ready calls?
[11:54:23] <bojanlazic> Could you use this plugin http://tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/ with navigation, and how hard would it be to implemente?
[11:54:32] <Duikb00t> Can you specify a line?
[11:54:44] <robertmaxrees> the // Smooth Scrolling menu elements
[11:55:10] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t either way, i'm not sure what your issue is.  i'd need to see a functioning example.
[11:55:37] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic not sure what you mean by "with navigation"
[11:56:08] <bojanlazic> if i go to the othere section and I want to get back or go to section n5
[11:56:36] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic all that library does is give you page transitions. the rest would be up to you.
[11:56:42] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, you could do that.
[11:56:59] <bojanlazic> and how hard would that be to implemente?
[11:57:04] <Duikb00t> robertmaxrees -- am I allowed sending you a link in a pvt msg?
[11:57:04] <zzaichik> here we go. http://jsfiddle.net/9begsLsL/3/
[11:57:26] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t if you can sent to me via pm, you can share it to the channel :)
[11:57:45] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic shouldn't be too difficult depending on your defenition and what all you want to do.
[11:58:19] <xebra> hi, when yo do jQuery(.whatever).after('<div>foo</div>'), is the new element created at once (synchronous), or can there be "race condition" issues? In other words, can I access the element on the next line of code, or is that not guaranteed?
[11:58:24] <Duikb00t> robertmaxrees > uploading
[11:58:25] <robertmaxrees> zzaichik you could literally just do $(window).scroll(whereBePageContainer);  btw.
[11:58:44] <robertmaxrees> xebra it's guaranteed - DOM interactions aren't async.
[11:59:04] <Bheam> arc_: does ios set css hover as an actual javascript event handler?
[11:59:22] <xebra> robertmaxrees, thank god. And thank you.
[12:00:16] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[12:00:39] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t make a fiddle though.  try to isolate your issue.
[12:00:46] <robertmaxrees> instead of sharing your whole site.
[12:01:02] <bojanlazic> robertmaxrees: could you give me the basic idea or snipet of how would you do it ?
[12:01:12] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic huh?
[12:01:30] <robertmaxrees> bojanlazic i have no idea what you're trying to accomplish, and that's me basically doing it for you.
[12:01:34] <robertmaxrees> soooo no :P
[12:02:37] <bojanlazic> I wanna use navigation with that plugin
[12:02:51] <robertmaxrees> that's ephemeral - "navigation" can mean all kinds of things.
[12:03:08] <robertmaxrees> and depending on how your site is build, that may or may not make sense with what you're trying to do.
[12:03:37] <robertmaxrees> feel free to take a crack at it yourself - asking somebody in here to do it for you is kind of counter-productive.  the point of this channel is for you to learn how to do it yourself :)
[12:26:51] <arc_> Bheam sorry, you referred to it as an event so that's what i took it as. try this http://retrogamecrunch.com/tmp/hover-fix
[12:28:47] <Bheam> heh
[12:29:02] <Bheam> well that's one way, for me, i preferred the way :hover was handled by ios
[12:29:20] <Bheam> but there is no way to clear the hover state, so had to put in a js fix for that
[12:30:10] <Bheam> basically hook up to a wrapper div and make an event on that, then :hover is transferred to that element when i click outside the link in question
[12:40:47] <claytonzaugg> how do you surround an <img> tag with a <div> through jquery
[12:41:04] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+surround+element+with+div :)
[12:41:24] <claytonzaugg> Excellent, even better! That's the search string I was looking for!  Thanks as always robertmaxrees
[12:45:48] <taplar> lol
[12:46:03] <taplar> i keep waiting for you to bust out lmgtfy
[12:46:13] <robertmaxrees> one of these days ;)
[13:00:26] <ceramicskulls> How can I get it so the 0 shows? http://jsfiddle.net/unm35fe0/
[13:00:55] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[13:01:23] <robertmaxrees> also, check out using $.fn.map and Array.prototype.reduce for that operation instead.
[13:03:06] <taplar> if you put the price class on the span or found the inner span, you could do this.innerHTML to same a jquery wrap too
[13:03:14] <taplar> *save
[13:12:21] <durwasa> Hi eveyone, I am a newbie when it comes to jQuery (and to the programming world as well) ... As per the suggestion of one of the member of this irc channel I made an application of mine the front end exclusively on jQuery and the backend on express ... https://github.com/durwasa-chakraborty/mail-client-jec link to the git repository... Can anyone please review it as to what all I should do to hone my skills in jQuery what all I should understand and learn
[13:12:21] <durwasa>  before I start contributing to jQuery ? -regards and sorry for the verbose question :P :P
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a big request. did you have any particular questions?
[13:13:14] <robertmaxrees> also, the best way to learn how to contribute it so start doing it and take in feedback from there.
[13:14:03] <durwasa> robertmaxrees, :P sorry but I asked about how to start contributing to jQuery and some gentleman told me that the first to get familiar with jQuery
[13:14:10] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:14:39] <taplar> i would suggest to hang out in here
[13:14:44] <taplar> lots of information flying around
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:15:06] <robertmaxrees> ask questions, offer help, that sort of thing.
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> you can also submit PRs to the project any time.
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> check out https://contribute.jquery.org/ for more on that,.
[13:15:31] <taplar> or just now and again you could also peruse the jquery chat logs in your down time
[13:15:44] <durwasa> robertmaxrees, probably he was right because it took me a 12 days to get along with this application (esp the ajax part takes some time to understand) ...
[13:16:08] <robertmaxrees> durwasa sure, and that's fine.  there's no singular, simple answer to your question.
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> you need experience and to just do it.
[13:16:36] <durwasa> robertmaxrees, taplar, sir I am a college student so every time is my down time and every time is my free time :D :D
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> check out the site i linked.
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> get to contributing ;)
[13:17:10] <durwasa> robertmaxrees, taplar is there any 'low hanging fruits' or 'first bug' kind of thing ?
[13:17:10] * taplar cracks whip
[13:17:24] <robertmaxrees> durwasa check out the bug tracker in the repo.
[13:17:24] <durwasa> robertmaxrees, ok right away
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> like, you're just gonna have to do it.
[13:18:36] <ceramicskulls> @robertmaxrees I noticed that the parseFloat is what removes the 0 when combining for the final total price, is there a way to be able to keep it? I looked into toFixed() but if parseFloat is removing it, toFixed won't work? Also, can I just remove the math.round stuff? It seems like parseFloat does the same exact thing already.
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls .toFixed() will work.
[13:18:52] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[13:19:07] <robertmaxrees> parseFloat gets you the number, toFixed makes it display correctly.
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> math.round isn't what you want - you want to display the number with a fixed number of decimals.
[13:20:24] <ceramicskulls> Yea, I just noticed
[13:20:35] <ceramicskulls> ok thanks robertmaxrees, understood now!
[13:20:35] <robertmaxrees> that's why you want .toFixed()
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[13:20:58] <ceramicskulls> and my code is a lot cleaner now
[13:20:59] <ceramicskulls> :D
[13:21:19] <taplar> durwasa: one small thing i notice on your https://github.com/durwasa-chakraborty/mail-client-jec/blob/master/public/javascripts/custom.js is your two variables are global.  Those could most likely be scoped down.
[13:21:52] <robertmaxrees> also, you're using both success and .done()
[13:21:58] <robertmaxrees> use just .done()
[13:22:19] <taplar> oh snap
[13:22:21] <robertmaxrees> store your selectors in variables.  use curly braces.
[13:22:22] <taplar> this is an email thing
[13:22:29] <taplar> please tell me your validating the emails on the back end
[13:22:35] <taplar> big risk of being hijacked
[13:22:59] <durwasa> taplar, okk
[13:23:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't need that .duccess call.
[13:23:23] <robertmaxrees> *success
[13:24:03] <durwasa> so put that success code snippet in the .done(function()) ?
[13:24:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:25:34] <durwasa> taplar, i have given a serious thought because the password is in plaintext ... I should have used Google+ api or any such api for instance ( i found a npm module named passport)
[13:26:16] <taplar> my concern was more about bots taking over your script, manipulating the email addresses, and using your server to spam people
[13:26:18] <durwasa> bt can you suggest a lighter mail client because as you said unfortunately I am not validating the emails on the back end ... :(
[13:26:40] <robertmaxrees> also - $('#send-to').val('Click any volunteer'); no-no.
[13:26:49] <robertmaxrees> set that in your html, not your js.
[13:27:04] <taplar> i would suggest to keep your email addresses on the back end
[13:27:05] <durwasa> ok placeholder i'll set the value
[13:27:13] <taplar> and have relations to them on the front end
[13:27:24] <taplar> so users can't make emails go just any where
[13:28:17] <durwasa> ok ok gotit taplar :) :) like volunteers email id should be at backend and some req should be issued before the email address is revealed
[13:28:18] <robertmaxrees> durwasa so https://bpaste.net/show/1d501c98c3c7
[13:28:28] <taplar> no, don't reveal it
[13:28:30] <taplar> label it
[13:28:40] <taplar> "Volunteer 1" or something descriptive
[13:28:47] <robertmaxrees> but store all those selectors in vars.
[13:28:49] <taplar> then on the back end when you get that, you map it to an email
[13:31:00] <durwasa> okk... taplar && robertmaxrees one more doubt this is more of a js doubt and it might sound really stupid bt lexical scoping and variable scope is very intimidating concept in js atleast i found it hard to understand so the scope of variable is global if declared on top ... now I am not able to understand the above mentioned points that how it becomes vulnerable if variables are declared on top
[13:31:30] <taplar> var makes it local to the scope you declare it in
[13:31:39] <taplar> and children can access it
[13:32:08] <taplar> so whatever the highest scope it needs to be shared in, put it there
[13:32:48] <taplar> in the case of mailContent in your example
[13:32:58] <taplar> it's only used in the change handler
[13:33:04] <taplar> so it could be declared in there
[13:33:05] <durwasa> yes
[13:34:03] <taplar> i should google and see how pervasive 'let' is now...
[13:35:04] <taplar> ah es6
[13:36:22] <durwasa> ok gotit :) :) thnx and thnx robertmaxrees for the paste :)
[13:37:19] <durwasa> taplar, the abstraction of email id that you suggested like mapping of id with some email address, can that be done without using any database client ?
[13:37:28] <taplar> sure
[13:37:47] <taplar> you could do that what a simple associative array in your code
[13:37:59] <durwasa> ok ok like a hash map ?
[13:38:03] <taplar> yeah
[13:38:10] <taplar> any key, value collection
[13:38:19] <durwasa> ok :) on it ! :)
[13:38:30] <taplar> and if the key isn't in the collection, user error!
[13:39:33] <taplar> this will also have the added bonus of your email address not being readily available on the client for crawlers to harvest and add to spam lists
[13:41:18] <durwasa> Yes i would just remove the input data type just one radio button to capture the selection
[14:00:00] <durwasa> taplar, https://bpaste.net/show/ab91edbb35ee something like this ?
[14:00:55] <taplar> looks like it
[14:01:03] <taplar> but you'll want to validate that the key is in the map
[14:01:15] <taplar> instead of just trying to get it, in case they send in something not there
[14:09:43] <_Noobie_> I'm trying to create a slide in-out navigation.  When i click my button, jquery fires and changes the visibility state from hidden to visible. Any ideas?
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> .animate()
[14:10:21] <_Noobie_> what would be the best values to use in anmite?
[14:10:34] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on how you're trying to animate it.
[14:10:43] <robertmaxrees> i can't see what you've got in your head so that's ephemeral.
[14:11:19] <taplar> there's also the jqueryui menu, which doesn't animate, but the base is already pre-existing for you, fwiw
[14:11:32] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees http://codepen.io/ThatWebGuy/pen/rOoMRK
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ read the animate() call.
[14:12:08] <robertmaxrees> check the docs.
[14:12:21] <robertmaxrees> or use css transitions.
[14:14:00] <robertmaxrees> and what's with that .canvas-slide?
[14:14:53] <_Noobie_> That's my attempt at making the siteWrapper slide to the left 300px.  robertmaxrees
[14:15:03] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the right: 300px; in there.
[14:15:09] <robertmaxrees> either way, check out the docs for .on()
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> err, .animate()
[14:15:23] <_Noobie_> I've got them up and reading them now.
[14:15:26] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[14:16:50] <robertmaxrees> also, might want to reconsider where you put that navigation.
[14:17:03] <_Noobie_> why is that?
[14:17:15] <robertmaxrees> because people expect navigation to be on top or on the left.
[14:17:18] <robertmaxrees> not the right.
[14:17:53] <_Noobie_> well with the logo I have to end up using putting the hamburger on the left would not work.
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:18:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to redesign things then.
[14:18:16] <robertmaxrees> because the right will confuse people.
[14:18:36] <robertmaxrees> top or left becuase that implies that you're about to change page context - it's based on how most languages read.
[14:18:44] <_Noobie_> yeah.  I've been on tons of websites where the navigation is on the right.  Not saying it was hidden on the right but it was on the right.
[14:18:52] <robertmaxrees> "tons"?
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> examples?
[14:19:26] <_Noobie_> one example is bootstrap
[14:19:32] <_Noobie_> it has a left and right menu.
[14:19:45] <robertmaxrees> right - the menu you're building is distinct from their right-hand menu.
[14:20:05] <robertmaxrees> if you want what they do, always show it.
[14:20:34] <_Noobie_> most people use their phone with their right hand which would put the menu on the right hand side.
[14:20:53] <robertmaxrees> i can see why you think that's a good idea, but comprehension and expectations are still more important.
[14:21:06] <_Noobie_> moving it to the left would make them have to either use both hands or switch to their left.
[14:21:08] <robertmaxrees> that's why the nav is left or top and then large enough to easily reach with your thumb.
[14:21:29] <taplar> do phone sites typically have menus?  seems like a space hog
[14:21:41] <robertmaxrees> taplar they usually have a buton of some kind for main navigation.
[14:21:46] <robertmaxrees> to expose the menu.
[14:21:50] <_Noobie_> depends on the site.
[14:23:11] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ any reason you're not using any of the prerolled navigation plugins that'll do this for you?
[14:23:52] <_Noobie_> I was using the built in bootstrap one but was having some issues with the logo in the navbar-brand
[14:24:07] <robertmaxrees> what were the issues?
[14:24:36] <ornerymoose> https://github.com/Geodan/DualListBox : Has anyone had success pre-populating the right-side box with a separate json file? Or is it only possible to pre-populate the left-side box?
[14:25:10] <_Noobie_> For the logo to be readable (thin font) I had to keep it so big that it made it hard for the navigation to be shown between 768px to 1330px
[14:25:32] <robertmaxrees> woah what?
[14:25:47] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need a smaller version of the logo then for mobile presentation.
[14:26:11] <_Noobie_> I do but I didn't design the logo and the client doesn't want it touched.
[14:26:12] <_Noobie_> lol
[14:26:19] <robertmaxrees> errr, then that's the compromise.
[14:26:20] <_Noobie_> this project is turning into more of a pain.
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> protect your client from themselves.
[14:26:59] <_Noobie_> Yeah.  Not having a graphics person on my staff kills me.  People have stuff made everywhere else and then I get stuck with it.
[14:27:23] <robertmaxrees> at this point you're giving up site usability for a logo.
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good tradeoff.  make things usable, reduce logo size - even if it can't be read.
[14:28:03] <_Noobie_> Yeah.  I wish the logo used a web font so I could modify it the way I need it to be.
[14:28:31] <robertmaxrees> nah, normally they don't include web fonts.  literally just make the image smaller.
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> or present it at "Full size" on pageload and then reduce it down as the user scrolls.
[14:28:56] <_Noobie_> I did, they didn't approve.
[14:29:07] <robertmaxrees> then they don't want a mobile site.
[14:29:11] <robertmaxrees> that sucks.
[14:29:34] <Anniepoo> I'd communicate with the client - explain the tradeoff, and why logos can't just be scaled, and suggest they devote a small amount of resources to getting a workable smaller logo from a graphic artist
[14:29:48] <robertmaxrees> or find another tradeoff.
[14:29:50] <_Noobie_> On mobile, would you move the logo above the menu button?  That might give me some more room.
[14:29:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:30:01] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go to lunch
[14:30:06] <Anniepoo> how about making the logo a watermark behind the UI?
[14:30:28] <_Noobie_> little lost on that Anniepoo
[14:31:25] <Anniepoo> that is, make the logo larger, tone it down, and then use it as the background behind all the controls.  If your mobile site is an 'accessory' off the desktop site the branding still works
[14:32:10] <_Noobie_> I see what your saying.
[14:32:17] <Anniepoo> alternatively, suggest to client that they should have a graphic artist fix this. A good GA can make a smaller, readable version.
[14:34:24] <Anniepoo> I'm working on a site with a train image in the logo. It's complex and doesn't look good at small scale. Our (very good) GA provided a smaller version as well, with a simpler version of the train in it
[14:35:27] <_Noobie_> The logo switching, do you do it as a css background-image?
[14:40:08] <_Noobie_> Anniepoo do you use sprites very often?
[14:50:13] <Anniepoo> I don't do a lot of mobile development
[15:23:43] <compact> http://jsfiddle.net/nz5fsf79/ <-- any idea why the total weight isn't using maths equation?
[15:24:08] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty big fiddle.
[15:24:15] <robertmaxrees> what do i do here?
[15:24:46] <compact> enter the QTY and weight
[15:24:52] <compact> then 'Add a product'
[15:25:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, becuase .val() retrieves text.
[15:25:16] <robertmaxrees> need to parseFloat() for adding things together.
[15:25:41] <robertmaxrees> also, $.each(test_arr, function(i, item) {  is the wrong version of each.
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> you want text_arr.each()
[15:29:20] <compact> ok ill look at that, thanks heaps! also one more thing, if I edit the "qty" and have already set the "length, height, width". the "tl cube" doesn't change
[15:29:27] <compact> until i edit the length, height or width again
[15:29:37] <compact> however if change the QTY, the weight does change
[15:30:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:31:11] <compact> I have the following values. QTY = 2, Weight = 1, Length = 120, height = 120, Width = 120
[15:31:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[15:31:36] <compact> "TL Cube" then equals 3.4560000000000004
[15:31:44] <robertmaxrees> "tl cube"?  you mean "total cubic"?
[15:32:00] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:32:02] <compact> "TL Cube" in the same row
[15:32:04] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of fields.
[15:32:10] <compact> if I change the QTY = 1, "TL Cube" doesn't get updated
[15:32:12] <compact> yup :\
[15:32:22] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a very good testr case fwiw.
[15:32:43] <compact> ill take some screenshots
[15:32:50] <robertmaxrees> screenshots are even less helpful.
[15:32:59] <robertmaxrees> $('#tbl1').on('keyup', '[data-type="operand"]', function () { - don't bind on data attributes, and step through the handler.
[15:34:54] <compact> so i should bind on each input name then?
[15:35:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> you should use a class.
[15:35:11] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are meant for storing data, not selecting.
[15:43:19] <compact> i changed it to $('#tbl1').on('keyup', '.input-text', function () { but still no luck
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> that was more of just a suggestion to make code cleaner.
[15:43:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd still step through it.
[15:43:49] <compact> ah k
[15:52:32] <converge> anyone knows the best way to do observeFields ?
[15:53:31] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[15:54:09] <converge> observe fields, like when you select an option at a select box, and the second select box is filled with db information
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> that's the "change" event.
[15:57:56] <berpcor> Hello.
[15:58:00] <berpcor> $("input:checkbox").on('change', function() {...
[15:58:12] <berpcor> Doesn't work with dynamically created elements.
[15:58:17] <bango2> true
[15:58:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener instead.
[15:58:21] <bango2> but if you add the onchange again
[15:58:24] <bango2> itll work
[15:58:28] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[15:58:38] <robertmaxrees> if you do that, anything you bound to will get re-bound.
[15:58:44] <berpcor> I read docs. It is said that on has live functionality.
[15:58:45] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener.
[15:58:51] <robertmaxrees> correct, keep reading the docs.
[15:58:55] <bango2> delegated listener huh
[15:59:00] <robertmaxrees> you skipped the second example.
[15:59:06] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:59:52] <berpcor> I see that I've missed the second param.
[15:59:58] <robertmaxrees> particularly http://i.imgur.com/sXICob8.png - the second example is what you care about.
[16:00:05] <robertmaxrees> you are also targeting the wroing element.
[16:00:13] <robertmaxrees> you bind to the parent, not the element directly.
[16:01:38] <berpcor> So... $("parent").on('change', "child", function() {
[16:01:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:01:52] <robertmaxrees> the parent needs to exist at the time of binding, which is usually at pageload.
[16:03:24] <bango2> TIL about delegated events
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> *delegated handlers.
[16:03:46] <berpcor> Can I always select body as parent for example?
[16:03:50] <robertmaxrees> events (almost) always bubble.
[16:04:01] <robertmaxrees> berpcor you can, but bind as far down as you can get away with.
[16:04:30] <bango2> your link says delegated events
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> sure does ;) it makes a little more sense if you think about it in terms of the handler, though.
[16:05:12] <robertmaxrees> delegated event handlers.
[16:05:16] <robertmaxrees> because the event isn't delegating at all.
[16:05:24] <berpcor> Ok. Got it. For some time ago I used on without the second parameter, and there was a time when it was working... Or I thought it was working...
[16:05:35] <robertmaxrees> berpcor it works if you bind it higher up.
[16:09:54] <berpcor> http://pastebin.com/3JMyuFLq
[16:10:14] <robertmaxrees> just do the table in that case.
[16:10:29] <robertmaxrees> "dynamic table" tells me the tbody is getting swapped out.
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> or the whole table.
[16:11:52] <robertmaxrees> is it the whole table?
[16:11:55] <berpcor> $("table").on('change', "input:checkbox", function() {
[16:12:38] <berpcor> Oh... I thought it won't work, but it works...
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't that work?
[16:13:12] <berpcor> Because $("tbody").on('change', "input:checkbox", function() { didn't work.
[16:13:34] <berpcor> And it is parent for any tr and td
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> depends on what is "dynamic"
[16:13:50] <berpcor> datatables plugin
[16:13:52] <robertmaxrees> right, but if the tbody element is getting removed/replaced/whatever.
[16:14:01] <berpcor> Oh... yes.
[16:14:08] <berpcor> It probably can be.
[16:15:43] <berpcor> So... one more time. As a parent I can use any closest parent element of my target element. But this element should always be on the page.
[16:16:01] <berpcor> Am I right?
[16:16:05] <robertmaxrees> you can bind to any persistent ancestor element, yes.
[16:16:10] <robertmaxrees> do so contextually though.
[16:16:23] <robertmaxrees> so if you have a widget, bind to the parent "widget" element, not some child of it.
[16:16:38] <berpcor> Ok. Got it again.
[16:16:57] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:17:00] <berpcor> Thank you very much for explanation.
[16:17:17] <robertmaxrees> thanks for listening.
[16:17:46] <berpcor> )
[16:30:48] <acidjazz> i found out a really good way to write jquery
[16:30:50] <acidjazz> https://www.facebook.com/ac1djazz/videos/10153756191925742/
[16:32:00] <robertmaxrees> have you tried a slightly smaller mask?
[16:32:13] <robertmaxrees> i feel like that one is almost too reasonably sized.
[16:34:19] <converge> Im doing an ajax call and the return is an [object Object], how can I populate a html select box with this information that is in this object ?
[16:34:35] <robertmaxrees> that's not the return ;)
[16:34:48] <robertmaxrees> console.log(data); or whatever you called it.
[16:34:52] <robertmaxrees> you'll see the object therew.
[16:36:07] <converge> robertmaxrees: the return contains an html page, but ths result should be an db select, some idea ?
[16:36:18] <robertmaxrees> fix the server.,
[16:36:24] <robertmaxrees> so you only get back the data you need.
[16:36:44] <converge> robertmaxrees: fix the server, what do u mean ?
[16:36:54] <robertmaxrees> the server should not return an HTML page.
[16:53:23] <_ix> afternoon fellows. i'm using this dumb Logi Info thing and trying to embed some jquery ui inside. from the dev console, jQuery.ui exists, but I can't seem to do anything with the widgets... $('#my_select').combobox(); reports an error.
[16:53:37] <_ix> i'm just using the jquery ui cdn, so i assume that has the widgets inside.
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[16:53:48] <_ix> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).combobox is not a function
[16:53:58] <robertmaxrees> have you loaded jquery?
[16:54:16] <_ix> also using the jquery cdn for jquery
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.  i'd have to see your code.
[16:55:12] <_ix> it's a minified proprietary mess
[16:55:18] <robertmaxrees> for your code?
[16:56:23] <_ix> yeah. like i said, i'm using this Logi Analytics thing. it's an xml templating application built over the top of .net and churns out html.
[16:56:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about logi analytics.
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> i care about your code.
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> the specific stuff you're using to load jquery and all that.
[16:57:34] <converge> robertmaxrees: fixed the server problem, now I have the return, but how to popuplate the html select item ?
[16:57:57] <robertmaxrees> converge probably looping through and appending items to the select.
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle with an example of your data if you're still lost.
[16:58:16] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've tried.
[16:58:32] <_ix> robertmaxrees: I'm just calling $('#my_select').combobox(); inside of $(document).ready()
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> _ix and you're not getting 404s for any of the jquery files?
[16:58:57] <robertmaxrees> they're properly loading?
[16:59:05] <robertmaxrees> your code is after the jquery includes?
[16:59:11] <robertmaxrees> you're loading things in the correct order?
[16:59:36] <_ix> robertmaxrees: It appears so. I can use jQuery, and jQuery.ui exists from the console.
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> try $.fn.combobox
[16:59:56] <_ix> Shouldn't I be able to call $('#my_select').combobox();
[17:00:12] <_ix> undefined
[17:00:19] <robertmaxrees> then you're missing something.
[17:00:20] <_ix> Do these CDNs include the Widgets?
[17:00:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what link you're using so i have no idea what you're looking at.
[17:00:57] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing references to that method name?>
[17:01:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox are you talking about this?
[17:01:23] <_ix> Yes
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use that.
[17:02:01] <_ix> Good grief.
[17:02:09] <robertmaxrees> click the "view source" link.
[17:02:41] <_ix> I'm an idiot. Thanks robertmaxrees.
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> custom widgets
[17:03:21] <_ix> I see that now.
[17:04:39] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[17:19:36] <acidjazz> is ther a way in js/jquery to detect say a bunch of float: left divs on when they break to a new line?
[17:19:46] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of.
[17:27:49] <vrishab> Hi .. I have a textfield ( id = id_shortName ). I update its value from elsewhere using  $("#id_shortName").val("somevalue")
[17:28:12] <vrishab> The value is updated in the textfield .. but no event is fired as a result .. I want some event to be fired ..
[17:28:29] <robertmaxrees> don't fire an event- call a function instead.
[17:28:52] <vrishab> why shouldn't it fire a change event .. ?
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> because you want to call logic - don't proxy that through the DOM
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> directly call the function you want instead.
[17:30:42] <vrishab> no .. I understand that calling the function is a perfect solution .. and it will work .. but I'm surprised why a change event is not fired .. Event handling looks cleaner than an explicit call .. no ?
[17:30:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:31:12] <robertmaxrees> you have logic you want to run after you populate a value.
[17:32:13] <vrishab> ok got it .. !!
[17:32:19] <vrishab> thanks !
[18:32:38] <vrishab> How to manually trigger a form validate ?
[18:32:45] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[18:33:28] <vrishab> Meaning .. I have setCustomValidity("..") .. and all is set .. But, currently the validation is done when the user clicks the submit button ..
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> what are you using for validation?
[18:33:44] <vrishab> I use my own custom validation .. no plugin .
[18:33:54] <robertmaxrees> then there's literally no way for us to know.
[18:34:26] <robertmaxrees> like, in a general sense i would abstract everything out and manually call it on form submit.
[18:34:54] <vrishab> Custom validation in the sense .. they are simple js functions ..
[18:35:41] <vrishab>     <input class="text-long" id="id_shortName" maxlength="15" name="shortName" pattern="[a-zA-Z ]{4,15}" type="text" required />
[18:35:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, none of that is helpful.
[18:36:10] <robertmaxrees> without a jsfiddle, all I can offer is what i said a few ago :)
[18:37:27] <vrishab> Ok ... next time I will get jsfiddle for sure ... I've not used jsfiddle ..
[18:37:57] <converge> hwo can I get the value "123" here ? <option value="123"> foo </option> , I tried val() and text(), but it dont get the value
[18:38:01] <converge> '123'
[18:38:20] <converge> I tried $("#itemType option:selected" ).val();
[18:38:35] <robertmaxrees> $("#itemType" ).val();
[18:40:44] <vrishab> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/mh42Lqa8/
[18:41:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, using the built-in html5 validation?
[18:41:11] <vrishab> click submit without entering anything ..
[18:41:19] <vrishab> yes ... html5
[18:42:00] <vrishab> basically validation is triggered when user click submit .. which is fine ... But I also want to trigger it manually ..
[18:42:03] <vrishab> is it possible ?
[18:42:41] <robertmaxrees> you're aware thgat html5 validation has limited support, right?
[18:43:13] <BobLobLawBlog> just use a linter
[18:43:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:43:28] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help in this case at all fwiw.
[18:43:33] <robertmaxrees> vrishab https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#Constraint_Validation_API
[18:43:43] <BobLobLawBlog> I never use a validator anymore
[18:43:59] <robertmaxrees> BobLobLawBlog linting and validation have nothing to do with one another.
[18:44:05] <robertmaxrees> and you should validate.
[18:44:06] <BobLobLawBlog> i know
[18:44:09] <BobLobLawBlog> but linting is cool
[18:44:16] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with what he was asking?
[18:44:20] <BobLobLawBlog> and there is html5 validator
[18:44:29] <BobLobLawBlog> is no*
[18:44:47] <robertmaxrees> there are built in ways to validate.
[18:45:55] <BobLobLawBlog> I don't see the value
[18:46:06] <BobLobLawBlog> do you validate your js, css, and php as well?
[18:49:29] <vrishab> robertmaxrees, thanks for the link .. that helps !!!
[18:51:17] <robertmaxrees> back.
[18:51:29] <hailhydra> what is the best place to get help with grunt ?
[18:51:30] <robertmaxrees> BobLobLawBlog we're talking about user input validation.
[18:51:51] <robertmaxrees> BobLobLawBlog and i don't write php, but i do validate my CSS and js and html.
[18:52:20] <robertmaxrees> hailhydra #grunt
[18:52:52] <hailhydra> I've posted there a few times and it's a graveyard
[18:53:03] <robertmaxrees> hailhydra that's the right channel.
[18:53:09] <robertmaxrees> #Node.js might be able to help too?
[18:53:20] <hailhydra> I'll try that one
[18:53:51] <bostonmacosx> evening all
[18:54:05] <bostonmacosx> is there any trick to get ".find" and IE11 working nicely together?
[18:54:15] <robertmaxrees> by using it.
[18:54:21] <robertmaxrees> no trick.
[18:54:37] <robertmaxrees> *assuming your markup is valid.
[18:56:34] <bostonmacosx> welll....
[18:56:49] <bostonmacosx> it works in FF and Chrome and doesn't in IE
[18:56:52] <robertmaxrees> if you're having issues, show us the case where it's not.
[18:56:58] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, that smells like a markup validity problem.
[18:57:03] <bostonmacosx> ok
[18:57:09] <robertmaxrees> IE11 is much more stringent than chrome and ff on those kinds of things.
[18:57:10] <bostonmacosx> I'm using a jQuery plugin as well
[18:57:23] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle to demonstrate the issue.
[18:57:50] <bostonmacosx> ok will do...
[18:57:56] <bostonmacosx> love th fiddle
[18:58:02] <robertmaxrees> :) yep.
[19:11:02] <bostonmacosx> what is the best way to get a jquery plugin into afiddle
[19:29:46] <robertmaxrees> bostonmacosx use the "external resources" on the left.
[19:31:01] <bostonmacosx> yeah I don't have it on a HTTPS or a CDN so it fails as text/html and not text/javascript for the mime type
[19:31:09] <robertmaxrees> rawgit
[19:31:13] <robertmaxrees> if it's on github.
[19:31:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just show me whgat you've got.
[19:31:25] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't function.
[19:31:30] <bostonmacosx> yea it is but it still says it won't...
[19:31:57] <bostonmacosx> Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benmajor/jQuery-Touch-Events/master/src/1.0.4/jquery.mobile-events.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[19:32:04] <robertmaxrees> terrr...
[19:32:05] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle.
[19:32:16] <robertmaxrees> and by rawgit i meant https://rawgit.com/
[19:32:49] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't wory.
[19:33:09] <robertmaxrees> *work - it sounds like your issue was with .find(), so that's the only code i need to see.  that and the relevant html.
[19:44:31] <robertmaxrees> welp
[20:14:43] <themagmaforce> hi there guys, i'm trying to send data (post) using ajax cross-domain (i own both servers/domains), but when i do it, it get switched to "options" and no data is sent
[20:15:24] <robertmaxrees> what kind of request is it?
[20:16:23] <themagmaforce> $.ajax, type=post, and a json data with some test strings
[20:16:31] <robertmaxrees> json or jsonp?
[20:16:54] <themagmaforce> $.ajax({ type post default, i'm not sure
[20:16:59] <robertmaxrees> (showing us the code would be awesome)
[20:17:09] <themagmaforce> wait :), sorry
[20:21:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:21:20] <robertmaxrees> that's taking a while, and i gotta go soon.
[20:22:09] <themagmaforce> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/439b89743b8483c7b802
[20:22:59] <robertmaxrees> so let's back up - do you actually need to authenticate here?
[20:23:07] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you're specifying a function for the xhr?
[20:23:31] <themagmaforce> that's for checking the progress (for images)
[20:23:55] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS would be a good read for you.
[20:23:58] <themagmaforce> i will remove it for now
[20:24:19] <themagmaforce> oh thanks :)
[20:24:27] <robertmaxrees> aaaabd i need to go home.  enjoy.
[20:50:19] <tomasm-> Is there a way for a container (in my case, a list of items connected to a nav link) to drop UP (above), ie position absolute against bottom: 0px (rather than top: 0px), so it doesn't overflow past the screen? I suppose I'd need a way using javascript to detect that the item flows off the screen and could better fit the other direction.
[21:26:44] <CronX3r> gf
[21:37:44] <bostonmacosx> ok back from earlier
[21:37:45] <bostonmacosx> https://jsfiddle.net/nfog1b1f/
[21:37:59] <bostonmacosx> so this works in FF and Chrome but not in IE11.....
[21:45:07] <shoky_> bostonmacosx:  add "var" before  var parent = $(this).closest('.row');
[21:45:14] <shoky_> er.. before  parent = $(this).closest('.row');
[21:45:29] <shoky_> do it for cart too..
[21:45:38] <shoky_> and stop alerting :|
[21:45:39] <bostonmacosx> why? if I may ask
[21:45:52] <bostonmacosx> I'm just protoyping a page so it is alert for now
[21:46:28] <shoky_> because without it you're accessing the global "parent" property (which is for getting the parent window), and it's problematic in IE
[21:46:39] <shoky_> you shouldn't alert when prototyping either
[21:46:43] <shoky_> console.log all the way
[21:48:45] <bostonmacosx> ok thanks for that....
[21:53:24] <bostonmacosx> if I put var in front of it I lose access to it in the script as a whole
[21:53:59] <shoky_> then declre it in a more outer scope
[21:54:17] <shoky_> but not in the global scope
[21:54:26] <shoky_> off to bed, good luck ;p
[21:55:34] <bostonmacosx> not global scope?
[22:03:44] <hailhydra> Can someone take a look at my gruntfile? No help from #grunt or #Node.js
[22:03:45] <hailhydra> https://dpaste.de/AMaY
[23:56:35] <confoozed> Hi!  I have a great animation working with  $thingy.show( 'scale', 100 * counter );    - I want  to also animate from slightly to the left of the target position, and animate opacity from  0 - 1 at the same time but I can't seem to parse it out.  Any documentation suggestions much appreicated.
[23:56:58] <confoozed> (with jquery ui - sorry I should have added that)
