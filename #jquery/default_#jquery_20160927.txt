[00:00:15] <alexel> hi, i'm trying to get a variable outside a functions scope ( i think )  http://pastebin.com/3htr7bf5 - and it dosen't work, can anyone help me  - this is out of my expertise, but the programmer i was supposed to work just dumped me, and i have a deadline in a couple of hours.
[00:47:47] <user_corrupt> I have the following script hiding divs until radio buttons are clicked: https://jsfiddle.net/ru2nn5wd/19/ How do I make the radio button labeled "Passive" totally unclickable unless one of the radio button above that include the label "verb to be" are clicked?
[01:49:11] <mechanist> hello
[01:49:16] <mechanist> I have this simple radio button menu
[01:49:21] <mechanist> https://jsfiddle.net/obxpqqc0/
[01:49:29] <mechanist> I want it changes when I click Go from radio button form to list form if 'Static Mesh' is checked
[01:49:37] <mechanist> I need of a proper javascript
[02:39:36] <user_cor_> line 10 of the following script defines a variable: https://paste.ee/p/hwl7H line 18 defines a function that uses that variable as a parameter. Line 33 calls that function and tries to provide that variable as an argument, but it's out of scope. How can I fix that?
[02:52:23] <Cork> user_cor_: move var verbTense into the ready function
[02:52:35] <Cork> (not the setting of the value though)

[04:01:59] <Uhkis> :DD
[04:02:00] <Cork> XaroRSA: please ask questions not for a person
[04:02:04] <Uhkis> that's what she said
[04:05:02] <XaroRSA> I missed your answer from yestereday
[04:05:20] <XaroRSA> i had to leave, and the chat logs dont go that far back
[04:05:29] <Cork> check the topic
[04:05:30] <XaroRSA> it was about that steelseries thing
[04:06:23] <XaroRSA> sourcerer
[04:08:49] <XaroRSA> mmm, i dunno
[04:09:17] <XaroRSA> it looks to me each time i call the initialization function, it only uses the initial object
[04:09:43] <XaroRSA> only if i use new steelseries.Led('canvasLinear1')
[04:09:54] <XaroRSA> then i get a clean object back that i can test
[04:11:18] <XaroRSA> if i am using ' new steelseries ' on each render, will it clog up memory?

[06:01:43] <Bhumi> can anyone help me to solve this?
[06:05:41] <Bhumi> anyone there?
[06:11:07] <shoky_> Bhumi you have a complicated question/fiddle, if anyone can help they will, no point in useless "anyone?" spam
[06:12:25] <Bhumi> shoky, i have just asked once to know anyone can help me to solve complicated issue
[06:13:56] <shoky_> yep
[07:46:09] <NTrash> How would I write this using the $.post() method? https://jsfiddle.net/ajzs48zg/1/
[07:48:08] <momomo> this is not working: o.selected = items.has('[item='+o.item+']');
[07:48:19] <momomo> why ?
[07:48:42] <momomo> o.selected = bar.find('> * > .items > .item[item=channels]') does work  ..
[07:48:54] <momomo> and items has the same chidlren
[07:50:06] <momomo> for simplicity, but this does: items.parent().find('>[item='+o.item+']');
[07:50:20] <BulleTTime> hi, does jquery use requestAnimationFrame for animations?
[07:52:51] <shoky_> BulleTTime: jquery 3 does, yes
[08:09:34] <Cork> NTrash: $.post("#", serialize).done(function).fail(function() {})
[08:10:13] <Cork> momomo: what is o
[08:10:35] <Cork> the dom select element? or a jquery object?
[08:10:35] <kali_> hi everyone. trying to make a simple function in jquery that adds buttons to an existing div in html, according to how many slides there is in a gallery. right now im having problems making the buttons even exist. after the jquery code is run, they dont get shown in the html output. my latest, non working iteration looks like this https://jsfiddle.net/w0n5ekaq/ , i have tried some different versions of how to initialise the var $butto
[08:11:29] <Cork> kali_: it depends on how the gallery works
[08:11:44] <Cork> some stores the original html content as strings and replaces the content in the page
[08:11:50] <Cork> you can't insert dom elements for those
[08:14:43] <kali_> Cork: okay you mean, i cant just insert the buttons?
[08:17:49] <NTrash> Cork: thanks for pointing me in the right direction regarding $.post() syntax
[08:28:15] <NTrash> Trying to convert $.ajaxSubmit() to $.post(), can anyone spot the problem? https://jsfiddle.net/ajzs48zg/5/
[08:35:20] <momomo> it's just an options object ... it's item that's relevant
[08:35:27] <momomo> Cork, ^^
[08:37:30] <r3zam> hey guys , i have this code http://pastebin.com/WwcATqY7 , i want to do console.log something if status of response is true or break it if the status is false , how can i manage that ?
[08:38:28] <Cork> NTrash: i already answered that...
[08:39:38] <Cork> NTrash: prob cause you don't find the element you're looking for, the second one always succeeds as .find returns a jquery object so it is always truthy
[08:40:03] <Cork> r3zam: break?
[08:40:13] <Cork> as in..? throw an error?
[08:40:37] <Cork> r3zam: also you can't ever return from a success handler
[08:40:42] <r3zam> Cork: yea , something like that , cause i need to stop if one of ajax requests got false status
[08:41:06] <Cork> (you want the .then() handler)
[08:41:49] <r3zam> Cork: actually i dont know how to change it to do the stuff , i used .then but i dunno how to pass response status and check it in .then
[08:41:54] <Cork> r3zam: i don't think you can; i hit the same problem a while back but i don't remember the solution i picked
[08:42:26] <Cork> r3zam: btw can you fix the server?
[08:42:30] <Cork> then you don't need that hack
[08:42:41] <Cork> (the server needs to send the correct content-type)
[08:43:24] <Cork> $.when($.ajax().then(function(data) { return data.status; })) is all you would need in that case
[08:44:26] <r3zam> Cork: its not about the content-type , i need to manage multiple step of importing something, server will return in json if the step correctly done or got an error , so i need to make multiple ajax requests on condition that if last one is completed do the next or response with error message
[08:44:53] <Cork> r3zam: i get that, but yes it is the the need for parsing the response means the server lies about what content it sends
[08:45:01] <Cork> and says it sends html when it is actually json
[08:45:12] <decx> you want a generator?
[08:46:11] <r3zam> Cork: i got what you saying now ;) , i will correct that , but any idea of cleanest way to handle multiple ajax requests ?
[08:46:32] <Cork> this is an extremely common error and it drives me nuts the every one fixes it with a hack client side instead of stopping the server lying
[08:46:49] <Cork> r3zam: you are doing it basically correct
[08:46:58] <Cork> the only problem is stopping when one fails
[08:47:11] <Cork> .when doesn't handle that
[08:47:32] <Cork> it waits until everything has closed (for one reason or another) and gives you the results
[08:48:01] <Cork> if you want to abort if one fails you will have to write your own when like implementation
[08:48:56] <decx> just spread the arguments in whens done()
[08:49:09] <Cork> decx: it won't abort if one fails though
[08:49:15] <Cork> and that is the problem here
[08:49:29] <Cork> the rest is simple
[08:49:47] <decx> then write a recursive ajax
[08:49:53] <Cork> yup
[08:50:06] <r3zam> decx: what do you mean by recursive ajax ?
[08:50:08] <Cork> well then it would be one request at a time
[08:50:23] <decx> did you ever write a recursive function?
[08:50:26] <Cork> r3zam: call a function that makes the next ajax call when the previous one is complete
[08:50:27] <decx> that, with ajax ;)
[08:50:53] <Cork> r3zam: the question is though, why do you want to stop the ajax calls if one fails=
[08:50:55] <Cork> *?
[08:51:08] <r3zam> decx: i know the recursive , but i dont know how to make it wait untill ajax request is done
[08:51:11] <Cork> cause recursive will make it take a lot more time
[08:51:35] <r3zam> Cork: boss want it :|
[08:51:43] <Cork> r3zam: function nextCall(index) { $.ajax().done(function() { nextCall(++index); }) }
[08:51:45] <decx> you have a function that calls ajax at a specific url, now in the callback/then you just call that same function with the new urla argument
[08:51:57] <Cork> run that on an array
[08:56:32] <NTrash> Getting error serialize is not defined https://jsfiddle.net/uwo3w89c/3/
[08:57:11] <r3zam> Cork: something like this one : http://pastebin.com/yV6zVZED , how can i pass types ?
[08:57:40] <Cork> r3zam: the return in the post makes no sense
[08:57:55] <Cork> r3zam: move that into the .done callback
[08:58:01] <Cork> and to the installTemplate last
[08:59:46] <r3zam> Cork: http://pastebin.com/b8QzwKF6
[09:00:16] <Cork> r3zam: you don't need the else case, just remove it and move the instalTemplate into the // Do Code (last)
[09:00:33] <Cork> well
[09:00:42] <Cork> the else case is needed if you want to handle things failing
[09:00:47] <r3zam> Cork: i want to do some coding if response if successfull
[09:00:51] <Cork> then you need to call it from there
[09:01:04] <Cork> ya, but you don't need the return <anything>
[09:01:18] <Cork> if you don't call installTemplate everything will just stop
[09:01:23] <Cork> no need for a return
[09:01:56] <r3zam> Cork: yup , got it , how can i pass types array to the installTemplate ?
[09:02:07] <Cork> r3zam: btw template_name and type needs to go into an array
[09:02:16] <Cork> and the value needs to be the index of that array
[09:02:27] <Cork> else you don't have anything to go on for how long the loop should happen
[09:02:56] <Cork> (the original nextCalls(index))
[09:05:26] <r3zam> Cork: http://pastebin.com/WvRCs7X9
[09:05:50] <Cork> r3zam: you need to move line 10 too
[09:06:16] <Cork> r3zam: basically .done is the (newer now quite old) way of doing success in jquery
[09:06:18] <r3zam> to .done ?
[09:06:21] <Cork> yes
[09:06:36] <Cork> it is much cleaner so i recommend using it in stead
[09:06:50] <Cork> and it lets you do cool things like passing the callback around in the code if you need to
[09:07:01] <Cork> so the callback consumer doesn't have to be at the same place in the code
[09:07:50] <r3zam> Cork: right , dont we need a condition to stop when array is done ?
[09:08:17] <Cork> r3zam: yup before the $.ajax call you need to check if arr[index] exist
[09:08:38] <Cork> a simple if(arr[index] == undefined) {}
[09:08:46] <Cork> opps
[09:08:48] <Cork> a simple if(arr[index] == undefined) { return; }
[09:11:59] <lilalinux> Apparently .data() doesn't use the data-* attribute. Can I still use data-* attributes as css selectors in css resources?
[09:12:22] <Cork> lilalinux: .data uses data- attributes as a source (if it doesn't have the value)
[09:12:39] <Cork> but it doesn't update it as data- attributes can only contain strings and .data can store anything
[09:12:58] <Cork> (including references to other dom elements)
[09:13:28] <lilalinux> so, css selectors won't reflect the current state?
[09:13:59] <Cork> as the value doesn't exist in the dom (at all), no
[09:14:08] <Cork> use .attr('data-key', value) if you need it there
[09:14:10] <lilalinux> thx
[09:14:16] <Cork> (or possibly consider using a class)
[09:17:11] <decx> dont just consider, if you can add an attribute you can also add a class, which has the benefit of being a class
[09:18:13] <Cork> heh ya, i expressed it a lot weaker then i actually feel
[09:18:27] <Cork> ppl shouldn't be so afraid of classes as they are, it is the butter of web development :)
[09:33:09] <r3zam> Cork: decx: thanks guys , it work perfectly
[10:05:24] <lilalinux> I have an element with a click handler inside a draggable element. How can I prevent the click event, if the outer element is actually dragged
[10:14:45] <BulleTTime> hi, anyone can test on mobile? (tablet)
[10:15:22] <BulleTTime> i was here a few days ago, someone wanted me to show my poor js animation example on mobile..
[10:15:33] <BulleTTime> not sure who it was
[10:54:55] <arnas> hey
[10:55:52] <arnas> $.get( "test.php", function( data ) { alert( "Data Loaded: " + data ); }); let's say I have this in a function. If data is equal to true, I want the function to return true, if data is false, I want the function to return false. How can I do that?
[10:59:23] <arnas> anyone?
[11:47:35] <KnightsOfNi> What happens if you do an animate 'left' property on an element that is fixed positioned with left: 50% ?
[11:48:29] <robertmaxrees> why not try it and find it?
[11:48:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:50:34] <robertmaxrees> KnightsOfNi https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qf44eshk/
[11:51:03] <KnightsOfNi> thanks :)
[11:51:17] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to make test cases of that kind of stuff (shrug)
[11:54:53] <KnightsOfNi> you're right
[11:57:42] <hlve> I'm always right.
[11:57:47] <robertmaxrees> hahaha

[13:11:55] <jquery196> Hi.. how to get this to get a max and min number
[13:11:55] <jquery196> https://jsfiddle.net/soa6rg94/
[13:11:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:56] <jquery196> a User should only allows to put between nr 1 - 15
[13:11:57] <robertmaxrees> why not check the value on input?
[13:11:57] <jquery196> robertmaxrees.. okey. by check higher than 15 or lower than 1 ?
[13:11:58] <robertmaxrees> if (theValue > 15 || theValue < 1) {}
[13:12:00] <jquery196> will try that =)
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably have to parseint the number fwiw.
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> *the value i mean
[13:22:30] <jquery196> robertmaxrees : https://jsfiddle.net/soa6rg94/1/
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:22:30] <jquery196> the number can still be over 15
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> tjos osmn
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> *this isn't what I suggested.
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> also, $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/[^\d].+/, ""));  - this is still a string.
[13:22:30] <jquery196> how did you mean =)
[13:22:30] <robertmaxrees> you need to convert it to a number instead.
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> also: contenteditable doesn't use .val()
[13:23:23] <jquery196> robertmaxrees : is this close ? https://jsfiddle.net/soa6rg94/3/
[13:23:41] <robertmaxrees> you have way too many lines in there.
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/soa6rg94/4/
[13:24:06] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:24:07] <robertmaxrees> see the issues?
[13:24:54] <jquery196> robertmaxrees: I will look later,, need to go. if you find the solution please update =)
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> i won't do it for you.
[13:25:09] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[13:26:16] <bomb> Help the guy, robertmaxrees. Don't be lazy.
[13:26:21] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:26:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not being lazy.
[13:26:54] <robertmaxrees> channel's all about teaching people how to fish.
[13:28:18] <bomb> Yeah, just kidding.
[13:28:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:29:04] <bomb> Something is troubling my mind lately.
[13:29:36] <bomb> Can you tell me what's the advantage of two-way data-binding, compared to good ol' jQuery way?
[13:29:49] <robertmaxrees> all about perspective.
[13:30:20] <robertmaxrees> in 2-way data binding, the argument is that everything syncs up nicely - it handles keeping the model and the view all in sync without you have to manually do anything yourself.
[13:30:38] <robertmaxrees> however, some people think it's a poor model, because it's hard to actually to correctly.
[13:32:15] <bomb> Yes, it sounds really good on the paper. But I also keep hearing they're actually anti-pattern.
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> It really depends on who you talk to.
[13:32:46] <robertmaxrees> I'm of the opinion that it's the wrong solution.  I really like the approach facebook has taken, which is that it's all one-way.
[13:33:54] <bomb> Talking about React? I though that makes use of two-way data binding too.
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> react + flux avoids 2-way data binding entirely.
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> flux is the magic there.
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> you COULD setup 2-way data binding, but that's the wrong way to do it imo.
[13:37:21] <piercedwater> is it atypical to have an ajax request every second on a site for an app?
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:37:50] <bomb> It's called short-polling.
[13:37:56] <piercedwater> what would the correct method be
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> why are you getting data every second?
[13:38:09] <piercedwater> chat app
[13:38:19] <piercedwater> to check for msgs
[13:38:23] <robertmaxrees> you want to look at something like sockets instead.
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> ajax is the wrong thing to use for that.
[13:38:38] <piercedwater> ok
[13:38:43] <piercedwater> thanks
[13:38:52] <bomb> Yeah, you'd want to use websockets.
[13:39:17] <bomb> If you want to use AJAX for some reason, have a look at long-polling instead.
[13:40:00] <neilpdx> you can still use javascript right?  there is a nodeJS server app i think it is called node.io?
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> node.io is for scraping and processing data.
[13:40:36] <robertmaxrees> you can use js client and server for sockets.
[13:40:50] <robertmaxrees> ots of libs out therel
[13:40:57] <bomb> neilpdx: Sure. For server-side, you have variety of options.
[13:41:29] <robertmaxrees> am i invisible?
[13:42:03] <bomb> Not to me.
[13:42:11] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> y'all acting like i'm not saying anything.
[13:43:36] <neilpdx> :) yes robert sorry :)
[13:43:43] <neilpdx> i think that i was thinking baout socket.io
[13:43:45] <neilpdx> sorry about that

[13:56:32] <robertmaxrees> toss 'er out
[13:56:47] <bolovanos_> probably remember my test page from yesterday http://bolovanos.atspace.cc/bootstrapTest/example/scrollspy.html
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:57:03] <bolovanos_> follow my test behaviour sequence pls
[13:57:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:57:10] <robertmaxrees> how about htis:
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> describe the bug you're setting.
[13:57:21] <bolovanos_> ok nvm - it is not important for it
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> then tell me what you're expecting to have happen.
[13:58:07] <bolovanos_> open page - click on @mdo3 in menu - it will smoothly scroll to that content
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:58:34] <bolovanos_> than use arrow up - it will instantly jump to the nearest #mdo
[13:58:40] <bolovanos_> in this case #mdo3
[13:59:00] <bolovanos_> if you do this to the top lvl #fat
[13:59:13] <bolovanos_> and than same sequence from the begining - it stops jumping
[13:59:19] <bolovanos_> but smoothli scrolls up
[13:59:45] <bolovanos_> smoothly
[13:59:53] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is the jumping on scroll?
[14:00:00] <bolovanos_> problem is am I am after smooth version
[14:00:04] <bolovanos_> yes
[14:00:21] <bolovanos_> it happens when "window.location.hash = $hash;	" is activated
[14:00:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:00:34] <robertmaxrees> you should take a look at the docs.
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> something tells me there's an option to handle this.
[14:01:09] <bolovanos_> I was using document.location - but I have found out that in some browsers it is not writeable
[14:01:16] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> document.location is meant only to send people to different pages.
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> oh woah.
[14:01:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah you don't want that.
[14:01:56] <bolovanos_> no - just rewrite hash
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> window.location.hash is usually what you want for that.
[14:03:43] <bolovanos_> btw commenting "window.location.hash = $hash;" ends up with "Unable to get property 'top' of undefined or null reference" when menu items are clicked
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean the one on line 46?
[14:05:28] <robertmaxrees> because that error is going to happen no matter what.
[14:05:41] <bolovanos_> no one at 15
[14:05:58] <robertmaxrees> uncomment it.
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> ah, easy.
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> if you don't set a hash, $(hash).offset() breaks.
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> this code seems really... messy.
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> i see exactly where you got it from though :)
[14:15:20] <bolovanos__> robertmaxrees, have you been writing something during outage?
[14:15:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:15:31] <bolovanos__> found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1489624/modifying-document-location-hash-without-page-scrolling
[14:15:40] <bolovanos__> it seems to be way more complicated
[14:15:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:15:51] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> why are you updating the hash like that?
[14:16:41] <bolovanos__> what do you mean "like that"?
[14:16:48] <robertmaxrees> why are you updating it on scroll?
[14:18:13] <bolovanos__> it seems to me as a logical conclusion when scrollspy is highlighting menu items accordingly to viewport position
[14:18:47] <robertmaxrees> so i'd love to agree with you, buuut...
[14:18:49] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
[14:19:02] <robertmaxrees> notice how they don't?
[14:19:07] <bolovanos__> seems to me that you do not like it
[14:19:20] <bolovanos__> can you pls make that page more specific?
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> the whole page.
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> scroll down.
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> notice how the section updates on the right?
[14:19:38] <robertmaxrees> but the URL doesn't change?
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> swapping the URL out from under the user when they didn't click to make that happen can be unexpected.
[14:20:42] <bolovanos__> is this conclusion made upon experience or some study on this topic
[14:20:47] <bolovanos__> not arguing - just asking...
[14:20:47] <robertmaxrees> experience.
[14:20:50] <bolovanos__> ok
[14:20:54] <robertmaxrees> the way almost every other site in the world operates.
[14:21:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm sure there are studies on the subject.
[14:21:40] <bolovanos__> 1) if something is one way - does not mean that it is right... 2) would love to see them :)
[14:22:01] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:22:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, I am well aware that trends !== good.
[14:22:14] <bolovanos__> I know - but you know that story about penicilin
[14:22:36] <bolovanos__> and that was coincidence - I have something to support my behaviour :)
[14:22:38] <robertmaxrees> however, there is something to be said when you see everybody else requiring a click to update the URL.
[14:22:39] <bolovanos__> at least
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> and that is?
[14:22:59] <robertmaxrees> and if you say "logical conclusion"...
[14:23:53] <bolovanos__> your guess is right :)
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not a very good argument.
[14:24:20] <robertmaxrees> you are not your users.
[14:24:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:25:08] <robertmaxrees> generally, changing things out from under the user in a way that's not expected should be carefully considered.  the user will make the assumption that the link they recieved is the link they'll then later copy out of the URL if they didn't click on anything.
[14:25:38] <bolovanos__> or otherwise - if you look for example on maps
[14:25:43] <robertmaxrees> the user feedback we get generally confirms this.
[14:25:50] <robertmaxrees> that's a distinct case, though.
[14:25:55] <bolovanos__> ok - taking my map example back
[14:25:59] <robertmaxrees> a web page != a map applicating ;)
[14:25:59] <bolovanos__> u must click
[14:25:59] <bolovanos__> brb
[14:26:05] <robertmaxrees> *application
[14:26:43] <bolovanos__> ok - will thing about that - but on page of this type - all information on one page
[14:26:49] <bolovanos__> I thing it is different story
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[14:26:52] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[14:26:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:26:59] <robertmaxrees> as the bootstrap docs themselves show you.
[14:27:12] <robertmaxrees> and many other sites follow that same pattern.
[14:27:45] <bolovanos__> ok - got your opinion ... - u got mine :)
[14:27:53] <bolovanos__> thank you for it!
[14:28:13] <robertmaxrees> my opinion happens to be shared by (and backed with) examples, as well as lots experience at my company.
[14:28:14] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> feel free to totally disregard my advice ;)
[14:29:04] <bolovanos__> it remembers me this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U
[14:29:07] <bolovanos__> :)
[14:29:18] <robertmaxrees> not the same thing at all.
[14:29:20] <robertmaxrees> But sure!
[14:29:20] <bolovanos__> no offence
[14:29:26] <robertmaxrees> Thanks for being super rude about it though.
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> Totally appreciate it :)
[14:30:30] <bolovanos__> :)
[15:06:45] <hlve> is there a cleaner way to do this true/false boolean? var isOtherLang = (lang.code === "jap" || "chi" || "kor" );
[15:07:03] <robertmaxrees> interestingly enough, that doesn't work the way you think it does.
[15:07:56] <hlve> i didn't think that would work.
[15:08:28] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec
[15:08:33] <hlve> basically have a ton of language codes that i need to check if lang.code returns with either of them
[15:10:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean if lang.code is any of them in the list?
[15:10:27] <hlve> yes
[15:10:53] <robertmaxrees> put 'em in an array and use .indexOf()
[15:11:11] <robertmaxrees> if (allLanguageCodes.indexOf(lang.code) > 1) {}
[15:15:25] <hlve> Eh. So any way around that if switch? Basically setting a PDFjs option to false if it returns another language, and true if english
[15:15:47] <robertmaxrees> you mean the "if conditional"?
[15:15:51] <hlve> yes
[15:16:05] <robertmaxrees> you could use a ternary-style conditional i guess.
[15:16:26] <hlve> not going to get a boolean true/false out of just basic js, eh?
[15:16:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could use Array.prototype.some here.
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjes9urm/
[15:18:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fjes9urm/1/
[15:18:42] <robertmaxrees> with the ternary version.
[15:26:01] <hlve> thx homie
[15:42:13] <bomb> robertmaxrees: What do you think about VueJS?
[15:42:25] <robertmaxrees> Lots of people love it.
[15:43:14] <robertmaxrees> i don't have any experience with it, but the syntax seemed a little funky.
[15:44:01] <bomb> Yeah, it's somewhere between Angular and React. Template syntax resembles Angular.
[15:44:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[15:44:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm not a fan of angular.
[15:46:08] <bomb> Still, having a template makes more sense than JSX.
[15:46:17] <robertmaxrees> i much prefer JSX syntax.
[15:47:01] <robertmaxrees> which, btw, is your templating engine.
[15:53:24] <bomb> JSX isn't terrible, actually. I just prefer not to mix stuff.
[15:53:24] <bomb> But it more sense with stuff like React Native.
[15:56:00] <robertmaxrees> i used to feel the exact same way, but if you componentize correctly with react it actually makes a lot of sense
[16:00:05] <bomb> Where do you put your CSS styles in a component you write in JSX?
[16:00:28] <bomb> Vue has something called single file components.
[16:00:35] <bomb> Have a look at the image: http://vuejs.org/guide/single-file-components.html
[17:35:15] <noaXess> hey all...
[17:35:36] <robertmaxrees> goooood afternoon :)
[17:38:41] <noaXess> have upgraded to jquery-ui 1.12.1 (jquery 3.1.1), all fine so far.. expect tooltip, in a dialog, i can't set collision option, see this pic: http://imgur.com/a/z1FH9
[17:38:50] <noaXess> i tried all collision options, but no luck
[17:38:54] <noaXess> any hint?
[17:39:18] <noaXess> i wnat, that tooltip goes over dialog border or tooltip swith here to the left side of te mouse
[17:40:59] <robertmaxrees> hrmn.
[17:41:05] <robertmaxrees> gotta simplified fiddle or something?
[17:41:12] <noaXess> wait...
[17:41:25] <noaXess> hm.. its in a big project.. let me think how to reproduce..
[17:42:02] <noaXess> before updgrade i use 1.11.4 and ther no such problems
[17:42:17] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a JQUI change then.
[17:42:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd guess you have a css conflict of some kind.
[17:44:20] <noaXess> what to search for?
[17:44:26] <noaXess> ah.. wait...
[17:44:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd use your inspector and go from there maybe?
[17:45:42] <noaXess> yeah
[17:46:23] <noaXess> inspector is not easy.. cause tooltip div will be femoved from DOM if you move mouse out of object..
[17:47:42] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's not the tooltip styles that you need to look at.
[17:47:55] <noaXess> i also found nothing..
[17:48:07] <robertmaxrees> no idea tbh.
[17:48:11] <noaXess> i have a special overwrite css, where i overwrite som ecss rules.. but also if i remove them, same prob
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no idea then.
[17:56:40] <noaXess> ok.. thanks for hints.. have a good n8 ;)
[17:56:57] <robertmaxrees> "n8"?
[18:19:57] <steadystatic> If you use $.ajax to POST a form and a file…do you have to refresh or change window location to upload subsequent form submissions?
[18:20:23] <robertmaxrees> nope
[18:20:29] <steadystatic> The form data is encoded like var formData = new FormData($(‘#someForm’)[0])
[18:20:45] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:21:39] <steadystatic> Weird - I bumped into this StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/a/166284 recommendingf using an iFrame or plugin
[18:22:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you're concerned with old IE.
[18:22:30] <steadystatic> I’ll have to debug my Spring REST controller to see what’s up - its some error with the file I send though I see it in the request payload params just fine.
[18:22:46] <steadystatic> Yeah not a concern for this application…hmm
[18:27:35] <steadystatic> I thought maybe the previous XHR requests were staying open
[18:27:50] <steadystatic> But timeline doesn’t indicate anything like that here’s my code so far:
[18:27:52] <steadystatic> http://dpaste.com/00EXFJA
[18:28:20] <robertmaxrees> should be fine.
[18:29:42] <steadystatic> OK thanks for taking a look, off to set some Java breakpoints sounds like
[19:47:52] <printForever> <a href="#" title="PLAY"><span class="icon-play"></span>PLAY
[19:48:05] <printForever> how to remove just the text PLAY
[19:48:09] <printForever> and leave the span
[19:48:11] <printForever> <a href="#" title="PLAY"><span class="icon-play"></span>PLAY</a>
[19:48:46] <robertmaxrees> .html() and .replace()
[19:50:03] <printForever> hmmmm
[19:50:09] <printForever> was trying not to use replace
[19:50:20] <printForever> .html selects all
[19:50:31] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[19:50:40] <robertmaxrees> without juggling around with textnodes.
[19:50:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/df69mvfh/
[19:51:47] <printForever> epic!
[19:51:52] <robertmaxrees> easy peasy.
[19:52:00] <robertmaxrees> though if you don't want to use replace...
[19:54:13] <printForever> ...
[19:54:22] <robertmaxrees> that wouldn't be the way to go.
[19:54:30] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/df69mvfh/1/
[19:54:41] <printForever> seems that my approach is not working
[19:54:41] <robertmaxrees> whaaaaa
[19:54:48] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[19:54:51] <printForever> I've pasted it under line 7
[19:55:06] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to swap between play and pause?
[19:55:09] <printForever> yes
[19:55:19] <robertmaxrees> wrong way to do it.
[19:55:24] <robertmaxrees> just hide/show them.
[19:55:31] <printForever> I want to do it like this
[19:55:35] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:55:51] <printForever> because
[19:55:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:56:00] <printForever> I don't want to create two buttons
[19:56:07] <robertmaxrees> that's the way you SHOULD do it though.
[19:56:13] <robertmaxrees> why do it "the wrong way"?
[19:56:24] <printForever> because I believe its the right way
[19:56:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:56:32] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[19:56:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy then :)
[19:56:34] <printForever> why is nothing happening on line 14?
[19:56:51] <robertmaxrees> make a more flushed out fildd.e
[19:56:52] <printForever> I'm targeting <a> I'm getting html
[19:56:57] <printForever> but replace isn't doing anything
[19:57:25] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/df69mvfh/2/
[19:57:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:58:09] <robertmaxrees> do .html() returns a string.
[19:58:15] <robertmaxrees> and .replace() operates against that string.
[19:58:20] <robertmaxrees> and then returns a string.
[19:58:27] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to run .attr() against a string.
[19:58:41] <robertmaxrees> open your console and you'll see the errors.
[19:59:05] <printForever> I just opened it lol
[19:59:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:59:35] <printForever> still nothing
[19:59:44] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:59:47] <robertmaxrees> did you fix the errors?
[20:00:30] <printForever> ... I'm not getting them in the console
[20:00:33] <printForever> I have some other errors
[20:00:40] <printForever> but not the ones after the click
[20:00:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/df69mvfh/4/
[20:00:48] <printForever> I'm switching the classes corectly
[20:00:52] <robertmaxrees> open console, reload page, click play.
[20:00:56] <robertmaxrees> error.
[20:01:17] <robertmaxrees> the error is that you cannot run .attr() on a string, which is what .replace() returns.
[20:01:35] <printForever> I already changed it
[20:01:36] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/df69mvfh/5/
[20:01:55] <printForever> I'm talking after the change concernign the attr
[20:01:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:02:00] <robertmaxrees> you're not paying any attention.
[20:02:09] <robertmaxrees> $(this).html().replace('PLAY', 'PAUSE'); returns a new string.
[20:02:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to set the html with that new string.
[20:02:21] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't magically modify it in place.
[20:02:33] <printForever> o.O
[20:02:45] <robertmaxrees> just like literally every other jquery method.
[20:02:52] <robertmaxrees> even native js doesn't work that way.
[20:03:15] <printForever> now I understand
[20:04:14] <printForever> Can I do it all in one line?
[20:04:17] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:04:34] <robertmaxrees> well, "do it all" as in what?
[20:04:37] <printForever> ok
[20:04:41] <robertmaxrees> all of thise text replacement stuff?
[20:05:28] <printForever> GOT IT
[20:05:53] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/df69mvfh/6/
[20:06:02] <printForever> thank you robertmaxrees
[20:06:05] <robertmaxrees> errr
[20:06:08] <robertmaxrees> scope that var down.
[20:06:15] <printForever> why?
[20:06:20] <robertmaxrees> it's global right now.
[20:06:23] <robertmaxrees> global vars are bad.
[20:06:31] <printForever> its not
[20:06:41] <robertmaxrees> yes, it is.
[20:06:47] <printForever> -_- but...
[20:06:51] <printForever> its inside of IF
[20:06:58] <robertmaxrees> and?
[20:07:04] <robertmaxrees> you never declare it with var, let, or const.
[20:07:05] <printForever> I don't follow
[20:07:11] <robertmaxrees> therefore, it's in the global namespace.
[20:07:15] <printForever> oh
[20:07:19] <printForever> ooooh
[20:07:22] <printForever> riiiight
[20:07:27] <robertmaxrees> you should also store $(this) and $(this).find("span") into vars and use those instead.
[20:07:35] <robertmaxrees> you should also use .prop() instead of .attr()
[20:07:51] <robertmaxrees> or, y'know, just do the two links in markup like I suggest and hide/show as appropraite.
[20:07:57] <robertmaxrees> really don't see the downside to that.
[20:11:18] <printForever> you have all the points
[22:30:16] <stoyvo> hmm, anyone have luck with jQuery(':focus') in electron?
[23:02:34] <chewymcfats> Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to append images to div's based off of their data card values. For instance - If a random card on my page has a datacard value set to 1, I want to apply the first image from my image array to it
[23:04:33] <chewymcfats> Im building a memory card game, currently the game works, but you match numbers from 1 - 10,  i have ten images and what image 1 to be appended to whichever location that one gets randomly sent to.
[23:20:01] <user_corrupt> I've got the following function: https://paste.ee/p/hFMX5 Line 5 changes the contents of "objectivePronoun" with the value of "reflexivePronoun". Line 3 tries to use .data to add an element such as "originalPronoun='test'" but it does not work (no errors). Ideas?
[23:25:10] <user_corrupt> ok, I see that my expectations are off
[23:25:39] <user_corrupt> is there a way to just add an arbitrary element like "original-pronoun='me'"?
