[00:13:13] <pixolin> Hello. I have a webpage with a grid of products, each having a list of icons that describe the products capabilities. I want to be filter the products that by clicking an icon, only products with that capabilty show up.
[00:14:11] <pixolin> I found some code snippet which uses input fields with type checkbox, to get the select/unselect status but I would imagine giving the icons the right class, this isn't necessary?
[00:15:05] <pixolin> has anyone dealt with a similar solution and can point me to a website with code example/tutorial so I get a better idea how to achieve this please?
[00:21:31] <pixolin> well, I just found http://luis-almeida.github.io/filtrify/ and will try if that works for me. Thanks for your kind attention.

[04:28:11] <Dramors> Hey people, quick question. How do I go about adding disabled to a textarea? $('.mytextarea').attr('disabled');? Is that going to work?
[04:42:55] <Rejected> Dramors, it should work provided you pass a second argument of 'true' to the attr method, like so: http://jsfiddle.net/Qg2eH/1/
[04:43:12] <Dramors> Rejected: thank!
[04:43:22] <Rejected> no problem :)
[04:53:00] <sqlnoob> Can anybody suggest a minimal jquery popup library with the option to create a overlay over the page that can not be closed.
[05:25:39] <sqlnoob> I think $(document).ready() is called once DOM are ready. anything that can be called when the DOM is being ready
[06:08:50] <Doddlin> hey all! I have a, hopefully, simple question
[06:09:13] <Jattenalle> the answer si 42
[06:09:36] <Doddlin> I’m posting a value from PHP like ”1 office” where 1 is the ID and office is the slug. How would I separate that variable into 2?
[06:09:54] <Doddlin> Jattenalle, I wish…
[06:10:08] <Jattenalle> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[06:10:10] <Jattenalle> there you go
[06:10:29] <Jattenalle> var array = string.split('separator');
[06:11:17] <Doddlin> I guess that would do it, I’ll try! :)
[06:11:36] <Jattenalle> or you can use .indexOf(' ') and use that to get the leftmost part of the string
[06:11:41] <Jattenalle> and split it using that
[07:23:48] <t432> i am making an ajax call to delete something, it reutns back with 405 (not allowed) error but it does that job.
[07:23:55] <t432> the job*
[07:24:01] <t432> shall I move on?
[08:03:23] <t432> why i'm i getting an error 405 (not allowed), it does the what i want it to do.  I would ignore but I need to do something else on sucess.
[08:04:05] <t432> anyone?
[08:04:23] <Dramors> Because that's what your server responds with, seemingly incorrectly?
[08:04:55] <t432> right.
[08:05:03] <t432> what could be the possible cause?
[08:05:09] <Dramors> Look to your server code or speak to the person in charge of it
[08:28:45] <h00> I am dynamically adding/removing elements to a form. When I call $('#formId').submit(), these new elements are not showing up in $('#formId').serialize(), only the elements which existing originally show. is there anything special that I need to account for when appending elements to a form?
[08:31:05] <BillCriswell> h00: That doesn't sound right.
[08:31:25] <ngharo> when are you calling serialize()?
[08:31:27] <BillCriswell> Are you sure you're serializing the right form?
[08:31:49] <h00> serialize is called within the form.submit
[08:32:06] <BillCriswell> h00: I think we'd need to see your code.
[08:32:43] <h00> BillCriswell, k. ill work on that
[08:34:23] <BillCriswell> h00: Here's a quick demo of it working I came up with. http://jsbin.com/jihemiye/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:34:46] <BillCriswell> h00: http://jsbin.com/jihemiye/2/edit
[08:36:18] <h00> hmmm that's is similar to what I am trying
[08:44:58] <h00> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/154a191da67164d1ff6a
[08:45:15] <h00> the js is missing other code that ties into the app, but that is the relevant part.
[08:47:21] <h00> the select-type is printed in the serialize, however the selects that are added in updateGroups are not
[08:51:30] <ngharo> "For a form element's value to be included in the serialized string, the element must have a name attribute."
[08:54:51] <h00> hah, just noticed the name thing
[08:54:52] <h00> fail
[08:54:59] <h00> thanks =)
[09:11:08] <JenniferB2> how can I make jquery do a jsonp request only if it is cross domain?
[09:16:59] <decx> var zetype = (iscrossdomain) ? 'jsonp' : 'json; [...] $.ajax(.... type: zetype
[09:35:20] <bjensen82> Hi I am changing an element dynamically for example <div id='user'></div> js: $("#user").data("user-id", 4); $('div[data-user-id="' + 4 + '"]').length returns 0..how do I make jquery pick up the change and return the element?
[09:37:17] <shoky> $('div').filter(function() { return $(this).data('user-id') === 4 }).length
[09:40:44] <rednovae> i'm using the jquery autocomplete plugin. Whenever I select something with this plugin, it writes what I have selected to the bottom of the document. How can i disable/rid myself of this functionality?
[09:42:53] <bjensen82> shoky: That works. Thanks, care to tell my why that works and using a simple selector wont?
[09:45:40] <shoky> bjensen82: cause .data() doesn't write to any data-* attribute on the element. (it only reads from data-* attributes the first time you use it on an element)
[09:46:24] <bjensen82> shoky: I see. Would using attr() yield the same result as .data() ?
[09:47:03] <shoky> using attr() would actually write to the attribute
[09:47:16] <shoky> so the selector would find it
[09:47:51] <decx> stick to the filter and data
[09:52:36] <bjensen82> decx: for performance reasons ?
[09:52:45] <bjensen82> shoky: thanks for the enlightenment
[10:43:54] <MichaelR> so can anyone help me with nth-child?
[10:44:15] <MichaelR> because when I try to use it I get: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :nth-child
[10:45:59] <droid909> hello, i have 2 js files in each one i have this jQuery.noConflict(); (function( $ ) { my code})( jQuery );   i'm trying to access a function that is in another file, why it is not found?
[10:46:16] <droid909> error: not defined
[10:46:53] <MichaelR> did you link to that file?
[10:47:05] <droid909> MichaelR: sure
[10:47:19] <droid909> MichaelR: it works if i call this function from withing the same file
[10:47:22] <MichaelR> then I have no idea >.<
[10:47:46] <droid909> MichaelR: i guess it is all in this noConflict thingie
[10:47:57] <droid909> MichaelR: i use prototype too, so i have to
[10:48:14] <decx> it's :nth-child(n) MichaelR
[10:49:22] <MichaelR> does it have to be n?
[10:49:29] <decx> n is a number
[10:50:01] <droid909> hmm, i ugess i can define fucntions as  fucntion window.myfunction() { } this should work rigiht?
[10:50:33] <MichaelR> i is set to a number
[10:50:38] <MichaelR> i is a number between 1-6
[10:50:59] <decx> well there's your problem
[10:51:06] <MichaelR> it wont work with a veriable>
[10:51:12] <decx> you cant do $('div:nth-child(i)')
[10:51:23] <decx> because your javascript wont have any idea that i is a variable
[10:51:45] <MichaelR> oh you're right I have to break out the quotations
[10:51:45] <decx> $('div').eq(i) is the most clean approach
[10:52:09] <droid909> guys, can i define functions like this?
[10:52:35] <decx> you can but you shouldnt need to
[10:54:02] <droid909> decx: i have 2 js files in each one i have this jQuery.noConflict(); (function( $ ) { my code})( jQuery );   i'm trying to access a function that is in another file, why it is not found?
[10:54:21] <decx> no idea
[10:54:28] <droid909> decx: it works ok if i call it from the same file
[10:55:04] <decx> you shouldnt need to put noconflict there
[10:55:35] <droid909> decx: but i have too, i need to have prototype.js include
[10:55:39] <droid909> included
[10:56:48] <decx> yeah but that doesnt matter in your plugin file
[10:57:24] <decx> (function($){})(jQuery) the jQuery in the trailing () "imprints that on all $ inside the function
[11:04:41] <droid909> decx: hmm, yes i know, i have an issue that i can't call a functon
[11:07:32] <droid909> decx: the problem is scoping i guess
[11:07:47] <droid909> (function($) {
[11:07:54] <droid909> scopes my functions
[11:08:08] <droid909> that is why they cannot be seen from another "scope"
[11:21:03] <cariaso> I've inherited some code which uses <body doc-events > but I've had no luck figuring out what doc-events is, or should be doing. if I inclde the doc-event I get a "TypeError: object is not a function". Can anyone tell me what doc-events is?
[13:21:53] <PantsOfChoco> duch leave your computer damnit
[13:47:09] <hikiko> hello, I'd like to refresh a div in a foo.php with the contents of a bar.php every few msec, I ve found some examples online and tried something like that: http://pastebin.com/hbhgApNb but I cant make it work, is there anything I'm missing (like browsers caching or sth?) I dont know js and jquery... thanks :)
[15:01:09] <MichaelR> why does this not work:
[15:01:09] <MichaelR> 	$('a:visible:nth-child('+menu_index+')').addClass('menu-button-active');
[15:05:37] <MichaelR> by not work I mean it does nothing
[15:06:57] <shoky> most likely because the selector doesn't match anything in the dom
[15:07:11] <shoky> `demo
[15:07:11] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:16:13] <MichaelR> shoky, could you help me find the proper selector then?
[15:16:19] <MichaelR> mrabinovsky.com/test
[15:16:32] <MichaelR> I'm looking to select one of the menu items with the arrow keys
[15:17:18] <MichaelR> if you look at the console you will see when you press an arrow key it asignes a number to a global variable. I am then trying to match that global variable to the nth-child
[15:21:29] <MichaelR> just for reference, this does work:
[15:21:38] <MichaelR> $( 'a:visible:nth-child('+menu_select+')' ).each(function( index ) {
[15:21:39] <MichaelR> 	console.log( index + ": " + $( this ).text() );
[15:22:39] <shoky> MichaelR: $('#menu1 .menu-button').eq(menu_index)
[15:23:04] <shoky> MichaelR: your current code is sort-of working. the index is wrong though, but the class is added
[15:23:23] <MichaelR> If the class is added why doesn't it show up?
[15:24:06] <shoky> because you have tons of conflicting css rules
[15:24:17] <shoky> .menu-button:visited
[15:24:24] <shoky> .menu-button:link
[15:24:31] <shoky> .menu-button-active
[15:24:41] <shoky> :visited is the one being applied last in this case
[15:26:49] <shoky> and it's because .menu-button:visited and .menu-button:link  have higher css specificity than .menu-button-active
[15:27:05] <MichaelR> so how do I fix that?
[15:27:07] <shoky> change .menu-button-active { .. }  to:  .menu-button.menu-button-active { .. }
[15:27:08] <MichaelR> do you know?
[15:27:20] <shoky> that way it's a more specific selector
[15:27:25] <MichaelR> hmmm gime one sec
[15:27:28] <shoky> hm actually that might not be enough
[15:28:19] <shoky> you might need to have :visited and :link versions for the active one just like you have for inactive..  but better to rethink your css probably
[15:29:02] <MichaelR> what you said fixed it. Though it showed me that I have to remove the class as well xD
[15:30:18] <frank_o> Greetings everyone! I am absolutely in shambles over this. What it is about jquery.embedly.js that disables iscroll.js when emulating a touch screen mobile device in Chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/w3pvW/
[15:31:00] <MichaelR> for some odd reason its starting at services and not at main
[15:31:16] <shoky> told you the index is wrong
[15:31:17] <xilyin> fyi you can build that menu with pure css/html
[15:31:33] <MichaelR> xilyin the point is to navigate using the arrow keys
[15:31:43] <xilyin> ahhh
[15:32:25] <MichaelR> I'm just going off the loop :/
[15:35:05] <MichaelR> well I fixed it, given what was wrong. I'm not sure why the index is right at the moment but hey it works
[15:36:23] <MichaelR> Thanks a bunch for all the help
[15:39:13] <shoky> MichaelR: it's because nth-child counts the <br> too
[15:39:32] <MichaelR> ahhh
[15:40:53] <MichaelR> there are no breaks between the menu items though, are they added automatically?
[15:41:44] <shoky> there's just one <br> at the beginning. you have this in the html:  <div id="menu1">MAIN MENU</br>
[15:41:51] <MichaelR> yes
[15:41:54] <shoky> </br>  counts as <br>
[15:42:12] <shoky> (doesn't make sense there anyway)
[15:43:10] <MichaelR> I thought my menu would go inline with main menu if I didn't have it there
[15:43:54] <MichaelR> and it closing your br like I do just an old way of doing things?
[15:43:55] <shoky> i meant that a </br> doesn't make sense, as that's a closing tag
[15:44:10] <shoky> maybe you mean <br/> ?
[15:44:16] <shoky> a "self-closing" tag
[15:44:34] <shoky> though <br> can't really be closed i think so it doesnt matter
[15:44:52] <shoky> anyways the browser just counts </br> as a <br>
[15:45:52] <MichaelR> I remember reading a long time ago that closing your BR (might be self closing and I forgot) was the proper way of doing it, lol. Guess I need to get on with the times.
[15:46:09] <xilyin> xhtml requires the closing of tags, html5 , <br> is sufficient.
[15:46:10] <shoky> maybe in xhtml or something
[15:47:21] <MichaelR> lol now I need to think of a way to make the enter key make you follow the URL on the button
[15:47:44] <MichaelR> and if that URL is javascript:void(0) just change menus
[15:49:07] <frank_o> Anybody aware of a tool that will compare two JS libs and see if they have conflicting namespaces etc.?
[15:49:07] <xilyin> can do window.location.href = location;
[15:50:53] <jumanji> hi guys how can I make this output the expected? http://jsfiddle.net/3PM9H/1/
[16:05:59] <MichaelR> would something as simple as enter_id = this.id; work for checking the id of the element on which I press enter?
[16:06:20] <MichaelR> well I tried it and it didn't, so rather is there something simple I am missing.
[16:18:46] <bilb_ono> can someone help me understand why this ajax request isn't being filled?: http://jsbin.com/depud/1/edit?html,js,console,output I tried to make it as simple as possible
[16:27:43] <MichaelR> so this works but instead of giving me an ID it gives me the Class
[16:27:44] <MichaelR> var enter_id = $('a', this).attr('id');
[17:42:21] <w00tner> hello
[17:43:20] <w00tner> i have a SPA, with several sections, in my #intro section i have a button that logins with fb, when you succesfuly login it hides the login button. it works fine
[17:43:34] <w00tner> but i would like to take the user to the next section (#list)
[17:43:52] <w00tner> i already set the <a href="#list"> but it does not take me
[17:43:52] <thinkxl> w00tner: are you using routes?
[17:44:16] <thinkxl> on the click callback using location.href = "#list" ?
[17:45:00] <w00tner> this is what happens whe i login
[17:45:01] <w00tner> http://pastie.org/9423704
[17:45:08] <w00tner> show a sidebar and hide a button
[17:45:20] <w00tner> i want to take the user to another section when logged
[17:46:11] <thinkxl> w00tner: http://pastie.org/9423707 this doesn't work?
[17:46:38] <w00tner> let me try it, thanks thinkxl
[17:56:54] <w00tner> thinkxl, do you know if location.href works with Phonegap ?
[17:57:11] <thinkxl> w00tner: not sure, it worked in the browser?
[17:57:38] <thinkxl> w00tner: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22247816/window-location-href-doesnt-work-in-phonegap-app
[17:59:52] <w00tner> window.location.replace("link.html");
[17:59:57] <w00tner> lets try
[18:00:48] <thinkxl> w00tner: tell me if it works, need to know too
[18:02:05] <w00tner> ok i will
[18:09:59] <w00tner> thinkxl, it does not seem to work
[18:10:07] <thinkxl> bummer
[18:13:18] <w00tner> mabye window.location.href = ('#list');
[18:14:52] <thinkxl> w00tner: using some router may work
[18:15:38] <w00tner> i will check on that
[18:15:40] <w00tner> thanks
[21:55:14] <sammich_> can you not set the default active tab in jQM (jQUI) tabs?
[21:56:20] <sammich_> calling the method on it doesn't even do anything
[21:57:15] <shoky> what method
[21:57:20] <sammich_> the active classes don't get added to the tabs, but at least the instance knows that the active tab has been changed
[21:57:33] <sammich_> $().tabs('option', active', 1)
[21:59:12] <sammich_> http://jsfiddle.net/vdU3K/2/
[22:00:25] <sammich_> I can $(li:eq(1) a').click() to activate a tab, but that's just not right
[22:01:22] <shoky> welp i know it works with jqui, donno bout jqm
[22:01:32] <coingamer> whats the diff between $(document).on("click",".sampleClass",callbackFN()) and $(".sampleClass").on("click",callbackFN());
[22:01:59] <sammich_> coingamer: delegation. .sampleClass might not exist at the time
[22:02:28] <coingamer> am using it for AJAX application
[22:02:33] <sammich_> btw, don't put in the parenthesis after the callbackFN
[22:02:51] <coingamer> just for example i have written here
[22:03:07] <coingamer> so on("click") doesnt work but document does work
[22:04:57] <coingamer> @sammich_ what is the best place to learn jQuery in details
[22:05:00] <coingamer> detail*
[22:05:16] <sammich_> http://learn.jquery.com/?
[22:05:48] <coingamer> with real time aplication samples
[22:06:13] <coingamer> like using in AJAX
[22:06:21] <Woet> coingamer: learn the basics first
[22:06:31] <Woet> and the learning center has Ajax chapters
[22:07:14] <shoky> sammich_: seems jqm doesn't do it properly, but adding some css it can work:   http://jsfiddle.net/9Sb3C/
[22:07:34] <sammich_> I found this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7407
[22:08:21] <sammich_> ah, I should've checked that
[22:08:34] <sammich_> the li has the class but not the a
[22:08:56] <coingamer> Thanks man @woet
[22:09:04] <sammich_> thanks, that's a better situation than just completely nothing
[22:14:03] <sammich_> okay, that's been worked around. find('.ui-state-active a').addClass('ui-btn-active');
