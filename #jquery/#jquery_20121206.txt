[00:18:30] <Mohsen_Hassani> Where can I see the archive of jquery plugins people have created?
[00:23:19] <ejo> it is lost
[00:23:22] <tw2113> the internet?
[00:25:23] <tigger1> hi
[00:25:47] <tigger1> How do i use jquery themes on my website? I wrote a link-tag, but that doesn't seem to do the trick.
[00:25:57] <tigger1> In my case it was ui-lightness
[00:27:27] <boulet101010_> you need to apply some classes
[00:27:52] <alex88> Hi, I'm reading http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring (the context part) and it seems that $('#element').myPlugin() makes 'this' inside the plugin be the #element selected element…
[00:28:29] <alex88> but when I do a console.log of this I get [context: #document, selector: "#image-comments"] not the dom element
[00:28:34] <alex88> in fact this.hide() doesn't work
[00:28:47] <tigger1> I applied ui-widget and ui-widget-content
[00:29:00] <tigger1> but it doesn't look like the examples on the jquery-website at all
[00:29:14] <alex88> this is the code http://pastie.org/5487766
[00:29:19] <boulet101010_> ewww, can't help more sorry, don't know a lot about jquery theme
[00:29:19] <tigger1> for example the font is much too big, although I never altered font size anywhere
[00:29:26] <tigger1> okay
[00:29:32] <tigger1> thx anyways
[00:30:54] <boulet101010_> alex88: reading
[00:31:27] <alex88> boulet101010_, thanks!
[00:32:52] <tigger1> n1 else?
[00:32:55] <tigger1> no
[00:32:56] <tigger1> ?
[00:32:59] <alex88> boulet101010_, tried with this.each() and it never gets called
[00:33:09] <boulet101010_> it's normal that this is the #element
[00:33:22] <boulet101010_> what do you want it to be?
[00:33:46] <alex88> boulet101010_, mmhh, but why if I do this.hide() it doesn't hide?
[00:34:11] <alex88> and console.log(this) gives the [context: #document, selector: "#image-comments"] and not the jquery object?
[00:35:09] <boulet101010_> http://jsfiddle.net/meafD/1/
[00:35:27] <boulet101010_> it hides
[00:36:34] <alex88> boulet101010_, oh, what an idiot.. i was using # and not . :S
[00:36:39] <alex88> sorry for the time waste boulet101010_
[00:37:07] <boulet101010_> owh
[00:37:08] <boulet101010_> owh
[00:37:13] <boulet101010_> =)
[00:37:17] <boulet101010_> noprob mate
[00:37:33] <boulet101010_> have a nice morrning/afternon/eve depending on where you live
[00:38:45] <alex88> morning here, maybe that's why :D
[00:38:51] <alex88> you too ;)
[00:41:12] <boulet101010_> got my eyes sticked together
[00:41:19] <boulet101010_> so same here
[01:04:15] <jamesgorrie> Ahoy - just found myself with some spare time and was wondering if anyone knew of any plans for jQuery to modularise?
[01:07:20] <tw2113> i thought jquery was a bit modular already
[01:08:56] <jamesgorrie> How so?
[01:08:56] <jamesgorrie> I am thinking more for file size - ask for what you want etc.
[01:09:17] <tw2113> "https://github.com/jquery/jquery "Modules (new in 1.8)"
[01:10:51] <rabbi1> how do i get the entire content of including <li>...</li> onclick of <a> tag http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/26/
[01:11:45] <tw2113> so you want all the html between the <li> tags rabbi1 ?
[01:12:41] <rabbi1> tw2113: yeah, all html between <li> and also <li></li> as well
[01:12:50] <tw2113> ah
[01:13:09] <BinaryKitten> .closest('parentSelectorYouWant').html()
[01:13:12] <tw2113> i was able to get all but the wrapping <li>
[01:13:24] <BinaryKitten> ah
[01:13:27] <tw2113> but not the <li> included
[01:14:50] <redixot> hello everyone
[01:15:11] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: closest will not give the content on (this)
[01:15:19] <redixot> can someone help me with javascript problem im facing...
[01:16:53] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/26/ as mentioned here , i get all the content of <ol>, but i need only <li> based on the click i make.
[01:17:37] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/27/
[01:18:35] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: cool, but <li> class is missing ...
[01:18:46] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[01:20:20] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/31/
[01:21:14] <tw2113> win@
[01:21:15] <tw2113> !
[01:21:16] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 http://jsfiddle.net/fUMfE/32/ = slightly better
[01:21:40] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: great, thanks
[01:21:53] <rabbi1> but 31 was better i guess, what's special about 32 ?
[01:22:02] <BinaryKitten> 32 = better than 31
[01:22:08] <BinaryKitten> less processing needed
[01:22:25] <BinaryKitten> .html with a function requires the html be loaded and processed
[01:22:40] <BinaryKitten> it's 1 extra call that's not required
[01:22:50] <BinaryKitten> 32 = better for performance
[01:23:43] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: thanks a lot :)
[01:23:46] <BinaryKitten> np
[01:23:55] <BinaryKitten> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.outerHTML  for more information
[01:24:42] <BinaryKitten> i've found this really awesome library that works really well alongside jQuery..
[01:24:55] <BinaryKitten> http://vanilla-js.com/
[01:25:00] <BinaryKitten> its the bizness
[01:25:13] <BinaryKitten> i hear that even jQuery has taken ideas from it
[01:25:37] <rabbi1> BinaryKitten: get(0) will get the exact <li> clicked right ?
[01:26:08] <BinaryKitten> rabbi1 .get(0) returns the domElement for the first item that matches the previous selector
[01:26:21] <BinaryKitten> which because we've done .closest  that should return only 1
[01:27:01] <BinaryKitten> wow... apparently Vanilla JS is already used on more websites than jQuery, Prototype JS, MooTools, YUI, and Google Web Toolkit - combined.
[01:27:35] <MeMReS> does e.preventDefault(); have trouble running locally? by locally i mean from file based url?
[01:28:04] <BinaryKitten> you'll need to provide more context MeMReS
[01:28:20] <BinaryKitten> it has no problem running at all
[01:28:28] <BinaryKitten> but it won't prevent other events happening
[01:28:36] <BinaryKitten> it just prevents the default action
[01:28:44] <BinaryKitten> like a link navigation
[01:28:46] <BinaryKitten> etc
[01:29:01] <MeMReS> <a id="pc1lm" href="#">Learn More</a>   $("#p1lm, #pc2lm, #pc4lm, #pc6lm").live("click", function(e){ e.preventDefault();  e.stopImmediatePropagation(); doSomething; return false;  });
[01:29:13] <BinaryKitten> .live?
[01:29:25] <BinaryKitten> might want to switch to .on style now
[01:29:54] <BinaryKitten> anyway i have to go
[01:30:01] <BinaryKitten> work becons
[01:30:43] <MeMReS> i was using .on but .live seems to work 50/50.. instead of running my code it'll reload the page =/
[01:31:05] <BinaryKitten> .live is no longer supported in newer versions of jQuery
[01:31:26] <codygman> So I'm a little confused as to why this is happening, a coworker edited my code and now a jquery post is redirecting the entire page:

[01:32:18] <BinaryKitten> MeMReS $('selectorOfClosestStableParent').on('click', 'selector of children', fn)
[01:35:07] <MeMReS> each are wrapped in div then span tags how would i go it?
[01:38:30] <MeMReS> hmm doesn't seem to matter
[01:44:19] <jamesgorrie> tw2113: thanks for that - now to dipin
[01:56:32] <MeMReS> span tag not a stable element?
[02:01:37] <greek> Hi I have an array of checkboxes in my form. If I use .hide() on some of these (to narrow down my list), and submit the form, will the invisible checkboxes' values still be processed?
[02:01:58] <greek> It's the same as a hidden input field I am hoping
[02:04:47] <greek> Ok solved
[02:16:00] <codygman> buttons made dynamically should still get the same css applied right?
[02:16:19] <WesleyL> yes
[02:22:26] <Eduard_Munteanu> I'm not sure where this question belongs... I'm implementing a RESTful web app, with DELETE/PUT methods. Should these methods return a full page, or would a separate GET request be more appropriate?
[02:24:09] <javalover> i have a very weird issue
[02:24:19] <javalover> in my code, the one i'm loading images i use background-url
[02:24:32] <javalover> and now I want to replace that with a video....and the video is loading through an iframe...
[02:24:40] <javalover> is it possible to change the background-url to an iframe?
[02:28:00] <vlad_starkov> Question: Why $('.my-element').position().left returns decimal value?
[02:33:52] <boulet101010_> because offsets can be floats
[02:33:57] <boulet101010_> they aren't int
[02:40:01] <seutje> vlad_starkov: we're all subpixel ppl in a subpixel world
[02:41:03] <vlad_starkov> Thnx
[02:42:22] <boulet101010_> seutje: so poteic
[02:43:03] <seutje> boulet101010_: I was actually trying to make a parody on material girl
[02:43:14] <seutje> but I didn't want to go as far as to call him a subpixel girl
[02:48:21] <javalover> is anyone here!?
[02:48:36] <seutje> there's like 840 ppl here
[02:48:44] <seutje> - a few bots
[02:49:16] <boulet101010_> olga is a funny submaterial girl ;)
[02:51:20] <Vill> greetings! does anyone have a time for chat with young web developer, that is - with me?
[02:53:43] <boulet101010_> Vill: #web
[03:00:00] <alex88> hi guys, I'm actually fetching a json with a list of comments, that should be outputted in html, that part is already done, now i want to poll the server for new comments.. but when rendering I don't want to replace the comments, just add the newer ones, how can that be done? kind of a sync between showed comments and comments to be shown
[03:01:24] <Vill> .append( content [, content] ) adds "content" to selected element, can be tricky if you will try to add some tags, which will be overlapping with previous ones
[03:01:43] <Vill> happened to me yesterday evening
[03:24:48] <wolfehr> hey all, having a bit of a brain misfire today. I'm validating a group of inputs, each of which has a name like foo[i] (with i being different for each element). Can I get javascript/jquery to treat this collection of inputs as an iteratable object (rather than splitting the [] piece off of the name value and then looking for all elements that match)?
[03:26:41] <wolfehr> alternatively, can I define a variable selector match, e.g. $('input[name="blah[(.*)]"') or something similar?
[03:27:19] <wolfehr> and yes I can, rtfm as usual....
[03:33:57] <pedda> hi there
[03:34:28] <pedda> i it possible to access some jquery plugin functionality within a non jquery js code ?
[03:34:44] <pedda> like i have some images, which are replaced dynamically..
[03:35:00] <NielsNL> can someone confirm that the accordion widget is broken in Jquery 183 and jquery-ui 192?
[03:35:17] <pedda> the replacement script is non jquery, but i would like to adapt the reflect() method as soon as an image changes, to update the reflection
[03:52:48] <_basic6> i'm looking for something that'll let the user select an integer value >= 1 (default), maybe with a little + and - button to increase/decrease, ideas?
[04:17:32] <arian> kentaromiura, can you look at my accordion?
[04:37:47] <kentaromiura> arian: which one?
[05:03:07] <Davey> How can I get an object of name:"value" key pairs for a form's inputs?
[05:03:55] <Davey> basically, an object representation of the string created by .serialize()
[05:09:08] <Davey> well, that was easy :P
[05:14:21] <mandarks> hey guys, im trying to get the width of an elements which it set to 100%, in my dev tools the computed height of that element is 447px.. what i do a console.log on the $('#selector').width(), it returns 100, no specification of unit of measurement.. how can i get it to return the computed height in px
[05:14:38] <mandarks> *when
[05:17:22] <mandarks> ?
[05:19:41] <MeMReS> using ajaxSubmit, it shows my what I'm about to submit, and I'm submitting to a php page but i get no response? no alert saying anything not even failure.. =/
[05:22:28] <xec> mandarks: .width() should return width in pixels. are you sure it's not 100px wide when you evoke the method?
[05:24:31] <xec> mandarks: also compare to .outerWidth()
[05:24:48] <mandarks> that would make sense because its box expands out to 440px but started with display none
[05:24:54] <syntax> how do i select a input under a specific id
[05:25:05] <syntax> #id>input?
[05:25:22] <xec> syntax: if it is a direct child, yes
[05:25:32] <Jon47> syntax: correct, but be aware that it won't work in some older browsers
[05:25:36] <mandarks> thanks xec
[05:25:46] <xec> syntax: if arbitrary descendant, just do a space "#id input"
[05:26:07] <mandarks> syntax: is this what you mean $('input#id-name')
[05:26:10] <syntax> ah ok space
[05:26:31] <xec> Jon47: what, like netscape?
[05:26:34] <xec> :d
[05:26:38] <xec> :D*

[05:31:39] <sssilver> Hello everyone. I am using jQuery.extend({}, myobj) without the first param being true, however the entire object with all its hierarchy and sublevels is getting copied
[05:31:44] <sssilver> I want only the top level to be copied
[05:31:47] <sssilver> what am I doing wrong?
[05:33:58] <Jon47> xec hehe, ya, i think only IE6 at this point, bad memories of having to support IE6
[05:34:41] <xec> Jon47: yeah indeed. you can still use > in jquery selectors though (even in ie6)
[05:35:13] <Jon47> ah, right on, forgot what channel i was in ;)
[05:48:16] <Davey> kentaromiura: that doesn't have the same semantics
[05:48:33] <kentaromiura> that's not what you asks?
[05:51:25] <Davey> kentaromiura: no, this is what I need: http://jsfiddle.net/xy9Mg/
[05:51:45] <Davey> it shouldn't pick up empty fields, nor the submit button

[06:13:39] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/ruvet/ can anyone tell me how i can shorten this code ?
[06:15:01] <EHLOVader> sorry ruby_on_tails tl;dr
[06:15:21] <ruby_on_tails> hardly 15 lines :P
[06:15:36] <ruby_on_tails> EHLOVader: i mean, i think i am repeating the same triggers
[06:15:58] <ruby_on_tails> is there  a way to attach the triggers to 2 diff events  and combine the code to make it smaller ?
[06:17:26] <EHLOVader> I don't see a way to refactor it, but I am not a jquery expert..
[06:17:41] <EHLOVader> it isn't long or too much of a cost burden though, I don't think it will cause you any troubles
[06:19:13] <ruby_on_tails> EHLOVader: no cost burden, just fun
[06:20:54] <EHLOVader> ruby_on_tails:  you remind me of this, from back in my Unix lab college days http://www.ioccc.org/
[06:21:23] <EHLOVader> there are quite a few impressive subbmissions, and the winners are all mind blowing
[06:21:33] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:21:41] <EHLOVader> here is one with output provided http://seanooi.net/1988-international-obfuscated-c-code-contest-winner/
[06:22:19] <kentaromiura> ruby_on_tails: you can use if (e.keyCode == 37 || e.keyCode == 39)
[06:22:35] <EHLOVader> kentaromiura: nope
[06:22:45] <EHLOVader> those are .next or .prev
[06:22:48] <EHLOVader> depending
[06:22:58] <kentaromiura> oh right
[06:23:08] <ruby_on_tails> kentaromiura: but the code inside is different
[06:23:09] <ruby_on_tails> cannot use that
[06:23:15] <ruby_on_tails> yea
[06:23:16] <kentaromiura> sorry didn't saw that
[06:23:19] <kentaromiura> :)
[06:23:24] <EHLOVader> I thought of that, or using '.aClass, .bClass' in the $(document) one too
[06:23:26] <kentaromiura> anyway gimme a sec
[06:23:45] <ruby_on_tails> it feels a very bad repeat :(
[06:24:06] <ruby_on_tails> to attach the same code twice
[06:24:12] <ruby_on_tails> to 2 diff events
[06:24:17] <EHLOVader> it is factored down to the least common elements
[06:24:47] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:24:51] <EHLOVader> I forget would $(document).keyup be the same? events bubbling up?
[06:25:24] <sunbeam> Hi, I've got a input field (actually doesn't really have to serve as a field but more as a background image button) where the user can click on, and when he clicks/uploads a file, he should see the file name in an input field
[06:25:31] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can best do this?
[06:25:41] <ruby_on_tails> EHLOVader: i think so,the code works
[06:26:35] <frankblizzard> I have a question about jquery (ui) draggables. So i can drag my 100x100px element around and I set up a containment - so it should stay inside this containing div right? but I can drag it to the right and bottom outside of that div exactly 100px (my elements size). How can I fix that? looks like only the top left pixel need to be inside the containment..? any ideas?? thx
[06:26:56] <frankblizzard> I am using a cutom generated draghelper div btw
[06:27:50] <EHLOVader> nop, ruby_on_tails I was thinking of combining the body part and the two documents, but they have different selectors
[06:28:04] <EHLOVader> and the event maps can only be assigned to one selector that way
[06:28:09] <bkeating> where do you guys get your JS news, etc? What RSSs' are worth subscribing too?
[06:28:26] <ruby_on_tails> EHLOVader: i can change document to body
[06:28:58] <EHLOVader> doesn't matter... you aren't using any other selectors on the keyup
[06:29:04] <EHLOVader> and the two clicks use different selectors
[06:29:09] <EHLOVader> cannot be put together
[06:29:11] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:29:15] <ruby_on_tails> ok i will live with it then
[06:29:22] <Anticom2> hi all, i'm having a dom element with html5 data data-maphilight="{alwaysOn=true}" attached... now if i try to select my element using [maphilight] selector, i get an empty jq collection :/
[06:29:25] <Anticom2> any ideas?
[06:29:36] <EHLOVader> you can though... chain the ons can't you?
[06:30:53] <ruby_on_tails> EHLOVader: how ?
[06:31:00] <ruby_on_tails> oh well
[06:31:02] <ruby_on_tails> hmm yes
[06:31:03] <ruby_on_tails> will do that
[06:31:21] <kentaromiura> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/ruvet/1/
[06:31:21] <EHLOVader> I think it works, what is the return for the chaining, it was jquery right?
[06:31:33] <EHLOVader> eek
[06:31:34] <kentaromiura> I don't like using the same map, but you got it
[06:31:45] <EHLOVader> you are going for job security now aren't you ruby_on_tails?
[06:32:24] <EHLOVader> use arbitrary unicode characters for the variable names, and create a paper copy with the translations... like a decoder ring for your code
[06:32:59] <ruby_on_tails> EHLOVader: naah not really
[06:33:18] <EHLOVader> did you glance at the obfuscated code demoed on seanooi?
[06:33:39] <ruby_on_tails> nope
[06:33:46] <ruby_on_tails> kentaromiura: thanks that gave me an idea
[06:33:57] <kentaromiura> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/ruvet/2/
[06:34:03] <kentaromiura> use two different maps
[06:34:17] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:34:19] <EHLOVader> 1988 winner of the IOCCC outputs "The twelve days of christmas" Lyrics
[06:34:32] <kentaromiura> also you can optimize it by caching $(documemt
[06:34:50] <kentaromiura> and $("#portfolio li.active")
[06:36:02] <EHLOVader> eh, that is a mixed bag kentaromiura... it may make it perform better but adds a line of code, to remove a handful of chars from two lines
[06:36:08] <kentaromiura> http://jsfiddle.net/ruvet/3/
[06:36:11] <EHLOVader> I was going by size... for some reason I only heard that
[06:36:28] <kentaromiura> for bigger maps can be better
[06:36:40] <kentaromiura> also is faster than switch case
[06:38:59] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[06:39:03] <ruby_on_tails> caching is a good idea
[06:39:04] <ruby_on_tails> but
[06:39:14] <ruby_on_tails> is it required ? i wont be using document anywhere else in the js
[06:39:22] <ruby_on_tails> oh i have already used it twice
[06:39:23] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[06:44:09] <Aha2Y> How could i do something like http://pastebin.com/r5hWr9K9 ?
[06:52:07] <misteroneill> Aha2Y: not with a regex, that's for sure. why not just use jquery - $('.NavTabs').find('a.SplitCtrl').replaceWith('TEST');
[06:54:30] <rideh> I'm using a template system that leaves my page specific script blocks loading before a footer import which has all my js imports. This is leaving code fired before jQuery is loaded. I do want the performance boost from loading the js at the end of the document. How do I get around this?
[06:55:40] <boulet101010_> reloadz: hi!
[06:58:54] <Aha2Y> Because that doesn't work MissionCritical ._.
[07:06:53] <firstclassfunc> how does jquery attach data to a DOM element?
[07:08:41] <reloadz> boulet101010_: hi! :)
[07:09:08] <VinSpee> firstclassfunc I believe since 1.7 it uses the data-* attr
[07:10:35] <VinSpee> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:11:21] <boulet101010_> everything's fine ?
[07:16:13] <xec> firstclassfunc: .data() will only read data-* attributes. for writing it attaches to the DOM element somehow - i'm not sure on the details but it's in here somwehere: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js
[07:20:25] <danzik17> firstclassfunc: basically, an identifier is attached to the element which corresponds to a property of jquery's internal cache object.  the reason for that rather than attaching an object directly is to avoid memory leaks in IE if i remember correctly
[07:20:30] <erichynds> iirc jquery attaches an expando to the DOM element, then stores any data internally in an object.
[07:24:56] <firstclassfunc> xec: you can attach data directly to the element without it being added to the DOM, but .data() will read data-attributes from the DOM also.
[07:26:37] <NoiseEee> ... the downside being you can never look up elements in the DOM by data reference if you choose to write with .data()
[07:28:14] <firstclassfunc> you can do $(elem).attr('data-identifier', 'abc123') if you want to do be able to identify by some DOM reference
[07:29:43] <xec> firstclassfunc: yes, that's essentially correct. what i meant is that .data() won't write to html5 data-* attributes - http://jsfiddle.net/yaXtd/
[07:32:04] <sunbeam> Hi, I've got a input field (actually doesn't really have to serve as a field but more as a background image button) where the user can click on, and when he clicks/uploads a file, he should see the file name in an input field
[07:32:06] <firstclassfunc> xec: ah, I see. you said it "attaches to the DOM element somehow"; I assumed you meant it was e.g. visible in the DOM
[07:32:08] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can best do this?
[07:33:10] <xec> firstclassfunc: yes, i believe it should be, but not as an attribute but an expando property. but don't take my word for it, i'm not 100% sure
[07:35:36] <rotham> $('.AnalysisSelect input:checked')  <-- this doesnt work.. how can i get all .AnalysisSelect checkboxes that are checked?
[07:35:52] <firstclassfunc> xec: ahh OK, very interesting. I didn't know about expando properties w.r.t. the DOM
[07:40:18] <halcyon1234> rotham: a space means children.  You want input.AnalysisSelect:checked
[07:40:30] <rotham> oh
[07:40:31] <rotham> derp
[07:40:45] <halcyon1234> I do that all the time.
[07:40:47] <xec> firstclassfunc: might just be an identifier though, http://jsfiddle.net/yaXtd/1/
[07:43:58] <firstclassfunc> xec: where is test2 stored?
[07:44:35] <firstclassfunc> inside of console.dir(el.get(0)) I mean, if at all
[07:45:33] <xec> that's just it. the only thing i can find is that number 1 (increases with each call so it's likely the ID, check out http://jsfiddle.net/yaXtd/2/ )
[07:46:14] <xec> actually http://jsfiddle.net/yaXtd/3/ but you get the point
[07:47:14] <xec> firstclassfunc: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L32 "...their data ends up in the global cache"
[07:47:24] <firstclassfunc> xec: hmm OK, wasn't sure what to look for. I'm fairly ignorant when it comes to the underlyings
[07:47:40] <xec> yeah me too, i'm just figuring this out as we go :P
[07:48:05] <xec> erichynds seems to know what he's talking about :)
[07:48:07] <Dahman> hello
[07:48:10] <Dahman> friends
[07:48:22] <Dahman> i have a big subject
[07:48:33] <firstclassfunc> gather round y'all
[07:48:36] <xec> like "love" or "war"?
[07:48:51] <FernandoBasso> How do I make an <option> become 'selected'? I am trying something like $('#' + e).attr('selected: selected');
[07:48:54] <Dahman> how to bypass the access denied when we manipulate an iframe
[07:48:55] <kentaromiura> like "c64" vs "vic20" ?
[07:49:43] <Dahman> o people !
[07:50:08] <xec> FernandoBasso: try .prop("selected", true)
[07:51:21] <FernandoBasso> xec: Works! Thanks a bunch.
[07:54:04] <xec> kentaromiura: everybody knows that if you want the chicks you go for the Amiga 500 http://www.starringthecomputer.com/snapshots/betrayed_amiga_500_2.jpg
[07:54:22] <kentaromiura> xec IDK, I had the intellivision
[07:54:25] <kentaromiura> :/
[07:55:02] <xec> lol, i had to google that - looks awesome
[07:55:29] <kentaromiura> my finger still hurts thinking of it
[07:55:35] <kentaromiura> fingers*
[07:56:16] <kentaromiura> but yeah it was awesome, especially this: http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CC0QtwIwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiJSkqjq_fR4&ei=CcDAUIBwxuK1Bsr0gWA&usg=AFQjCNELNhF33DzCAuaaIrEtJRgEYU7j7g
[07:56:22] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/Me8j3/
[07:56:32] <anew> guys i'm lost how the hell is there an uncaught syntax error here
[07:56:38] <anew> it is on the line of console.log
[07:56:42] <anew> says there is '.'
[07:56:59] <anew> unexpected token '.'
[07:57:02] <anew> i dont see anything anywhere
[07:57:18] <kentaromiura> ahem
[07:57:22] <nerk> morning and happy friday eve!
[07:57:34] <kentaromiura> you put console.log('again'); in an object literal
[07:57:48] <nerk> wondering if anyone knows how to make dialogs/popups in jquery.mobile not inject the ui-dialog-active hash?
[07:57:56] <kentaromiura> anew: ^
[07:58:11] <nerk> specifically "#&ui-state=dialog"
[07:58:23] <nerk> can that be disabled?
[07:58:36] <anew> eh? should be " you mean ?
[07:58:37] <nerk> as hitting back and forward doesn't make it appear anyways
[07:58:48] <nerk> and causes weird loading behaviour
[07:59:10] <xec> anew: do you know what an object literal is?
[07:59:41] <anew> no googling it now
[07:59:52] <xec> anew: { "key": "value" } <-- valid { "key": "value", console.log("blah") } <-- invalid!
[08:00:12] <anew> ah doh... but after the parenth it should be ok right
[08:00:24] <anew> validate( console.log() {} ); ?
[08:00:25] <xec> yes
[08:00:27] <anew> k
[08:00:31] <xec> no whatP
[08:00:35] <xec> lol
[08:00:39] <xec> -p+?
[08:00:46] <anew> -p+
[08:00:46] <anew> ?
[08:00:53] <xec> anew: i thought you meant after the )
[08:01:15] <anew> so nowhere inside validate() can i console.log anything ?
[08:01:29] <xec> anew: if .validate() expects an object, you can't pass a console.log() call to it
[08:01:37] <anew> bleh
[08:01:41] <anew> fine
[08:02:10] <kentaromiura> sorry
[08:02:12] <xec> anew: what are you trying to do, exactly?
[08:02:16] <anew> validate() not running not sure why, wanted to console.log up in there
[08:02:20] <kentaromiura> didn't want to sound too technical
[08:02:41] <anew> kentaromiura , u didnt i'm just a noob lol
[08:03:05] <kentaromiura> well at least you leart something
[08:03:06] <kentaromiura> :)
[08:03:31] <anew> also, guys... what is a quick way to find out what the page is using - $ jQuery or something they wrote themselves
[08:03:36] <anew> anyway to test which works which doesnt
[08:03:43] <nerk> woot, that was easy  data-history="false" on the popup div
[08:03:49] <anew> i guess here i made function($) so will $ work for all wrappers inside that?
[08:04:24] <xec> anew: yes you're fine - as long as "jQuery" exists
[08:04:30] <xec> $ will be jQuery
[08:04:49] <anew> u mean as long as i close it with (jQuery);
[08:04:49] <anew> ?
[08:05:01] <nerk> if you are worried about other versions of jquery injected into your pages, then you can assign the namespace yourself with jQuery.noConflict();
[08:05:04] <anew> hmmmm not sure why ().validate() is not running then i thought maybe the wrapper was wrong
[08:05:09] <xec> with that construct, yes. but that will only work if jQuery is included already
[08:05:15] <nerk> eg. var $JQ=jQuery.noConflict();
[08:05:19] <anew> sorry what do you mean 'included'
[08:05:52] <xec> loaded
[08:06:02] <nerk> or you can do it via a javascript closure
[08:06:16] <anew> u mean <script src blah blah> right
[08:06:49] <xec> anew: hehe maybe. if the src is an url to the jquery source, and i the html before your script :)
[08:06:56] <xec> s/i/in
[08:07:38] <anew> hmmok thanks guys
[08:09:30] <Gx4> does anyone have a clue why my $.downloadFile post gets status canceled?
[08:10:38] <xec> what a patient man
[08:19:23] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/QpFYz/ how come i'm getting even for the third div class when it should be odd next to each <p>?
[08:20:04] <Luyt> I have a very large webpage with at the top a banner in which I want to load a random css background image. I do that know in the document.ready(), but would it also be possible to preload the image (with a bit of JS in the header) and then insert it in the DOM as soon as both the image and the document have finished loading? What would be a good approach?
[08:21:53] <anew> what's a good way to test if the $ wrapper is working, something easier than $.click() ?
[08:23:55] <xec> anew: you could do console.log($().jquery) and see if you get a version number in the console
[08:24:08] <sunbeam> Hi, I've got a input field (actually doesn't really have to serve as a field but more as a background image button) where the user can click on, and when he clicks/uploads a file, he should see the file name in an input field
[08:24:12] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can best do this?
[08:26:19] <anew> hah very interesting xec let me try that
[08:26:42] <anew> 1.6.2
[08:26:44] <anew> bleh
[08:27:06] <suppp> is there a way evaluate expectations with jasmine inside html generated with jQuery ?

[08:47:13] <sgharms> agggggg.
[08:47:16] <sgharms> sorry wrong paste
[08:47:18] <sgharms>     return c.shouldShow( 'setMaxPrice' );
[08:47:41] <FlyingFoX> is the documentation for jquery1.3.2 still available somewhere?
[08:47:52] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: is there anything left for me to do on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/829
[08:47:54] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by sgharms (2w, 3d ago): Menubar
[08:49:11] <slick-> anyone here ever had problems with the Facebook javascript SDK
[08:49:16] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/QpFYz/
[08:49:21] <slick-> in ie7
[08:49:27] <someprimetime> why the hell is it adding even to 1 and 3 in the third div?
[08:50:36] * sgharms tries to remember a time jQuery wasn't on github...
[08:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: kborchers knows the menubar code better, but I'll comment on style issues.
[08:55:53] <nerk> jsfiddle is broken, someprimetime
[08:55:58] <nerk> however, your selector is flawed
[08:56:07] <nerk> you'd want div p:even
[08:56:09] <nerk> not just p:even
[08:56:14] <someprimetime> oh shit i had that originally
[08:56:16] <someprimetime> before i saved it
[08:56:17] <someprimetime> thanks man
[08:56:20] <nerk> np
[08:56:20] <someprimetime> (duh)
[08:56:51] <someprimetime> and when is jsfiddle going to just start charging because i'd gladly pay for service with some kind of uptime guarantee
[08:57:05] <nerk> first time I have ever seen it down actually
[08:57:11] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: sorry I missed your reply in a netsplit :(.  Would you mind re-transmitting?
[08:57:14] <nerk> it's usually pretty reliable
[08:57:39] <nerk> from all the ping timeouts and such.. I almost wonder if one of the interwebz lovely hubs died
[08:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: jzaefferer and kborchers knows the menubar code better, but I'll comment on style issues.
[08:57:50] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: n/m see updates now
[08:58:45] <kborchers> sgharms: scott_gonzalez i have been away from menubar for a while so i would have to re-familiarize myself with it and that PR
[08:59:25] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: kborchers OK to both.
[08:59:53] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: When you say "spacing" you mean between parentheses defining the arg-list and the arguments, not "use tabs versus spaces"
[09:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> Though, use tabs not spaces :-)
[09:00:17] <sgharms> I thought that /was/ jQuery style, to do that.
[09:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously don't use tabs for the spacing :-P
[09:00:35] <sgharms> o_O
[09:00:36] <sgharms> no
[09:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: Which line specifically?
[09:01:43] <sgharms> l68:  spacing
[09:03:48] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: I guess on the upside, this PR will be the perfect thing to extract a jQuery UI style guide from because I'm blundering past every one of them :-/
[09:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: I don't see any comment on that line.
[09:04:08] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: let me just add a line note in GH
[09:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[09:04:59] <wroathe> .
[09:09:53] <supsup> has anyone ever seen this?  page has jquery 1.7 on it.   $().jquery returns 1.7 .   then someone redefines jquery to be 1.5.  then they completely move jQuery to a new namespace in another object via jQuery.noConflict(true) which somehow reverts $ on global scope back to 1.7
[09:11:21] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: Please verify my interpretation of your comments, please.
[09:11:39] <shoky> supsup: yep
[09:12:03] <supsup> shoky how does it remember what the OG jQuery was?
[09:13:11] <sunbeam> Hi, I've got a input field (actually doesn't really have to serve as a field but more as a background image button) where the user can click on, and when he clicks/uploads a file, he should see the file name in an input field
[09:13:15] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can best do this?
[09:13:27] <shoky> supsup:  it saves the original..
[09:13:49] <supsup> so if u ever redefine $ it saves the old version of $ inside of itself?
[09:14:14] <supsup> 1.5.oldversion= 1.7 (roughly)?
[09:14:19] <shoky> supsup:  one of the first things in the jquery src is:  _jQuery = window.jQuery   _$ = window.$
[09:14:29] <shoky> saving the original jQuery and $
[09:14:42] <supsup> ya figured was looking at that.
[09:14:49] <supsup> just never knew it did that.
[09:15:38] <supsup> ok i get it.  Basically i should of just looked at the source code.  What was idea of doing that gymnastics to be able to do this one casE?
[09:16:01] <shoky> what?
[09:16:28] <supsup> storeing the previous def locally inside the new def.
[09:17:17] <supsup> nm i think i know. it's so noConflict will even work mostly
[09:17:20] <shoky> it's just for noConflickt
[09:17:26] <supsup> but can also be used for this weird case
[09:17:52] <supsup> which i guess is a no conflict of sorts.
[09:18:30] <supsup> like the API page says: removeAll A Boolean indicating whether to remove all jQuery variables from the global scope (including jQuery itself)
[09:18:45] <supsup> but thats not true if it was used to not conflict with a pervious version of jquery
[09:19:06] <shoky> the boolean just says whether to  remove jQuery as well as $
[09:19:15] <supsup> but it does not remove it
[09:19:24] <shoky> to remove the current one.
[09:19:33] <shoky> putting back whatever was there before it
[09:19:40] <supsup> it says All jquery vars
[09:19:44] <supsup> not to repalce anything
[09:19:46] <shoky> meaning $ and jQuery
[09:19:48] <shoky> not just $
[09:19:51] <supsup> i'm just saying i read it like that.
[09:20:03] <shoky> i'm just explaining the meaning
[09:20:16] <supsup> $ and Jquery are still there after the call
[09:20:32] <shoky> dude, go look at the source for noConflict()  it's like 5 lines
[09:20:36] <supsup> i did
[09:20:48] <shoky> it doesn't remove them
[09:20:52] <shoky> it replaces them with the original
[09:20:54] <shoky> ok?
[09:20:54] <supsup> i get the source, i'm nto trying to be a dick lol.  I did not get the Api def
[09:22:04] <supsup> i was going off api def.  It does not mention replace at all except for other library, i did not get the other library could be jquery itself
[09:22:51] <shoky> but you do get it now.
[09:23:01] <supsup> yes thanks
[09:23:49] <wolfehr> is it possible to determine if a jQuery plugin is bound to a DOM element? The JS that does the binding is loaded multiple times via AJAX and I can't check the state by adding a class or whatever as this is removed each time the content is reloaded
[09:24:26] <shoky> wolfehr: there's no such thing as a plugin being bound to a DOM element
[09:24:35] <shoky> wolfehr: it's wholly dependent on what the plugin does
[09:24:45] <shoky> if it doesnt do anything for example..
[09:24:54] <shoky> nothing is bound, you have no way of knowing .. anything.
[09:24:54] <wolfehr> so a plugin can't bind to a dom element?
[09:24:57] <shoky> (nothing to know)
[09:25:03] <shoky> what does that even mean?
[09:25:26] <wolfehr> so how does a plugin know what happens to a DOM element it's initialised on?
[09:25:44] <wolfehr> there has to be an association somewhere
[09:26:06] <shoky> it has different ways .. attributes, properties, DOM data, some local map in the plugin method..
[09:26:24] <shoky> anyway there is no general answer to your question because it doesnt make sense
[09:26:35] <shoky> however, if you ask the actual question you wanna ask, naming the actual plugin
[09:26:40] <shoky> then we'll have something to talk about ;p
[09:27:00] <wolfehr> file upload plugin (jQuery File Upload by blueimp)
[09:27:38] <wolfehr> multiple pages of a reg form, loaded by ajax, one stage of which contains $('#fileupload).fileupload(blah).
[09:28:27] <wolfehr> when going to other sections of the reg form (the content is replaced with the new section) and coming back to the section that has the file upload (the filupload initialisation is occurring in this content loaded via ajax) it increases the number of times the file upload is triggered
[09:29:05] <wolfehr> binding is what i referred to, as if i bound  an event handler to the same event multiple times, what's happening here would occur
[09:29:51] <wolfehr> I can't destroy the old association as I get an error stating the object doesn't exist, but clearly some connection is being retained
[09:30:33] <wolfehr> I could just set a global var I guess, that would persist and then enable me to check that to force it not to create another instance of the plugin
[09:30:40] <shoky> you're removing #fileupload from the DOM and then adding it back and calling .fileupload(..) again on it ?
[09:30:49] <shoky> what kind of element is #fileupload
[09:31:14] <wolfehr> not explicitly removing it, the content is being replaceWith()'d (whether that's the same, I'd assume so). it's an input
[09:31:37] <shoky> yea i didnt mean explicitly removing that element
[09:31:43] <shoky> but, it's being removed
[09:31:51] <wolfehr> yep, and what you've mentioned is pretty much the case
[09:33:05] <shoky> well, i think you need to call .fileupload('destroy')  before the replaceWith
[09:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> sgharms: Replied to your comments. Basically the rule is SPACES EVERYWHERE. :-)
[09:34:07] <shoky> wolfehr: also.. the only problem you mentioned is 'it increases the number of times the file upload is triggered'
[09:34:17] <shoky> wolfehr: what's the actual symptom of that
[09:34:44] <wolfehr> if i perform an action handled by filupload it's triggered however many times I've reloaded the content with ajax
[09:35:11] <wolfehr> I don't get how its maintaing a connection to a non-existent element (that's my main query on all of this)
[09:35:26] <shoky> what is the action?
[09:35:43] <wolfehr> clicking file upload, or dragging a file onto the droppable area
[09:36:03] <shoky> well it doesnt need a connection to that original #fileupload element
[09:36:10] <shoky> in order to be active on the page
[09:36:28] <shoky> and bind event handlers multiple times (not to that element, but to the document element, for example)
[09:36:55] <shoky> for example $(document).on('drop.fileupload', ... )
[09:37:02] <shoky> or whatever, just made that up
[09:37:22] <wolfehr> sure, I get that, but I'd have thought a plugin would have some kind of inherent connection to the element it's instantiated with, I guess not
[09:37:27] <shoky> so, call $('#fileupload').fileupload('destroy')
[09:37:38] <brend_> well
[09:37:42] <shoky> it might also have some connection to that element
[09:37:59] <wolfehr> yeah, I know that's a solution, it's just not one I want to perform in that section of code, as everything is separated quite nicely atm
[09:38:01] <shoky> but when that element is removed, fileupload plugin doesnt get notified in anyway, probably
[09:38:23] <shoky> wolfehr: it's either destroying, or not removing the element in the first place at all.
[09:38:33] <shoky> i dont think you have any other options
[09:38:49] <shoky> besides.. editing the plugin itself:P
[09:38:49] <wolfehr> I'll just prevent it reinitialising by storing it's state in a var outside of the ajax replace
[09:38:58] <shoky> uh
[09:39:16] <wolfehr> it makes sense to me :P
[09:39:27] <shoky> whether that works or not is really dependant on what the fileupload plugin does
[09:39:32] <shoky> good luck :P
[09:40:04] <wolfehr> thanks for clarifying those bits, I thought plugins were a little more dependent on the elements they were initialised with, but I guess that's author driven
[09:40:07] <shoky> i suppose it'll keep working.. but i donno if clicking the new #fileupload will do anyhing
[09:40:41] <shoky> wolfehr: yes, jquery plugins are nothing more than functions. they can do anything they want
[09:43:01] <joshsmith> mollykate: hallo
[09:43:59] <mollykate> joshsmith: hi
[09:44:31] <sgharms> scott_gonzalez: thank you, I need heuristics
[09:45:31] <sunbeam> when the user clicks "browse" at an input type="file" field
[09:45:40] <sunbeam> how can I enforce this ?
[09:46:24] <shoky> enforce?
[09:46:50] <sunbeam> simulate
[09:46:57] <sunbeam> nvm i see its not possible out of security reasons
[09:47:04] <shoky> ya dont think its possible
[09:47:11] <shoky> without ugly ugly hacks that barely work
[09:49:30] <sunbeam> well there's custom file upload
[09:49:55] <shoky> and does it simulate a click on an input type="file" bringing up the browse dialog ?
[09:50:07] <shoky> without you actually clicking ?
[09:59:08] <sunbeam> ehm no
[09:59:31] <sunbeam> shoky: i simply want to have an image (banner image) where the user clicks on
[09:59:39] <sunbeam> then he can pick a file (has to be image)
[09:59:45] <sunbeam> then that image replaces the banner image
[09:59:47] <someprimetime> you could simulate a click() event but IIRC that won't work in FF
[09:59:49] <sunbeam> You understand what I mean?
[09:59:54] <someprimetime> but why would you even want to do that?
[10:00:06] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: sorry you'll have to provide an explicit means to do so
[10:00:07] <sunbeam> someprimetime: ^^
[10:00:25] <sunbeam> http://zippyshare.com/
[10:00:28] <sunbeam> so how do they do it
[10:00:29] <someprimetime> so this is probably for an avatar change or something
[10:00:31] <someprimetime> right?
[10:00:38] <Gho5t> someprimetime: irrelevant
[10:00:44] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: flash
[10:00:46] <Gho5t> don't argue with people's requirement
[10:00:47] <Gho5t> s
[10:00:57] <someprimetime> it's not irrelevant, since i'm trying to figure out how to handle it from a UI perspective
[10:01:03] <someprimetime> yeah but that's flash
[10:01:07] <someprimetime> i'm not arguing, dingus
[10:01:16] <dblosevn> lmao ^^
[10:01:30] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: wait let me get another example
[10:01:34] <Gho5t> he wants a file upload to open when a banner is clicked on
[10:01:40] <Gho5t> "buttt whyyyy"
[10:01:49] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: you're not going to get me one because its unpossible.  you have to explictly provide a file input for them to click.
[10:01:56] <someprimetime> because i needed an example @Gho5t
[10:02:02] <someprimetime> so quick to white knight over here
[10:02:20] <Gho5t> an example... you really don't get it?
[10:02:23] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok then flash, and alternatively when flash is not available, show normal input
[10:02:27] <Gho5t> no so quick to be tired of people doing that
[10:02:42] <someprimetime> then don't answer since i wasn't asking you!
[10:02:45] <someprimetime> real simple stuff!
[10:02:46] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: so now your image banner is flash?
[10:02:58] <dblosevn> NoiseEee: yes you have to provide a file input for them to click but it doesnt mean they have to be able to see it, you can overlay it over top of the banner size it to the size of the banner and set its opcaity to 0
[10:03:04] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i can use an image and put it IN flash just like zippyshare does
[10:03:09] <someprimetime> i'm gonna take a stab at this
[10:03:14] <Gho5t> i get it. you don't know how so you question the requirements. maybe next time you don't answer
[10:03:16] <sunbeam> dblosevn: yes
[10:03:31] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: so give dblosevn's idea a shot, sounds innersting
[10:03:50] <dblosevn> peops do that all the time
[10:03:58] <sunbeam> yea im just looking for a good example
[10:04:02] <dblosevn> so you can create a custom style for your file inputs
[10:04:08] <sunbeam> dblosevn: do you know a script or something that provides functions for this?
[10:04:16] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: he just told you how to do it
[10:04:17] <sunbeam> or any example i can google for
[10:04:18] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: figure it out.
[10:04:30] <dblosevn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5813344/how-to-customize-html-input-type-file
[10:04:34] <dblosevn> theres an example
[10:04:35] <sunbeam> o kthanks
[10:04:38] <sunbeam> thanks
[10:04:40] <dblosevn> 3 seconds on google
[10:05:56] <dblosevn> is there a channel for iis development anyone knows of I cant find one :-(
[10:06:41] <brend_> dblosevn: dude
[10:06:49] <dblosevn> ive been stuck for 3 days with a simple requirement no combination of keywords ive tried has helped me on google
[10:07:05] <dblosevn> brend_: what now ? :-) lol
[10:07:30] <brend_> haha
[10:07:42] <brend_> nothing man
[10:07:51] <dblosevn> tru tru, jus messin with ya
[10:09:52] <brend_> dblosevn:  have you tried msdn
[10:09:53] <brend_> ?
[10:12:26] <dblosevn> a channel or the actual msdn lol
[10:12:41] <xec_> dblosevn: if by iss development you mean asp.net you can try ##asp.net ;)
[10:12:44] <xec_> iis*
[10:13:13] <brend_> i would suggest asp.net also
[10:13:16] <dblosevn> I need to require IIS, Hostable webcore to be installed before leting my application install
[10:13:39] <xec_> sounds funky
[10:14:10] <dblosevn> ya, id much rather use a different web server but the corporate requirements, require me to use microsoft technologys
[10:14:56] <dblosevn> they let me slide with php for the actual application but wouldnt budge on me using iis for the webserver
[10:15:05] <shoky> y u so funky, corporate requirements
[10:15:05] <b-ot> (å±®'Ð”')å±®
[10:15:15] <xec_> rofl
[10:15:26] <dblosevn> and the application is an offline app so it has to install its own web server
[10:16:00] <brend_> damn
[10:16:55] <shoky> dblosevn i got a friend who might be able to help you
[10:17:01] <shoky> on irc
[10:17:09] <shoky> i can get him to come to freenode
[10:17:12] <dblosevn> be awesome ill even pay
[10:17:16] <shoky> sec
[10:17:25] <brend_> lol
[10:17:30] <dblosevn> ive hired 2 people already on this both failed and wasted my time
[10:17:56] <brettster> hey guys - I'm trying to add a close and open class to an accordion. on the h2's they all have a predefined class of close - but on the section of the accordion that's open. i want the h2 to have a class of open.
[10:17:57] <brettster> http://pastie.org/5489860
[10:18:00] <brettster> please help.
[10:18:16] <dblosevn> skypes cool too, if he dont wanna come on freenode
[10:18:21] <Heather_> is there any function that can trigger an event if the user closes the webbrowser or the page that the site is shown on? I've unload() but it seems to trigger on lots of thing that can be done e.g back and forward buttons etc.
[10:18:40] <gx_> Is there any known issue with IE8 not recognizing $('#form').submit()  ?
[10:18:55] <gx_> script is working fine in all browsers but IE8
[10:19:11] <dblosevn> Heather_: unload is it, unfortunately theres no way ive found to detect a close
[10:20:58] <shoky> sup LordPapi
[10:21:04] <dblosevn> brettster:  $('.accHeader').click(function(){ $('.accHeader').addClass('close');$(this).addClass('open');
[10:21:10] <LordPapi> hi
[10:21:13] <LordPapi> how are u doing
[10:21:19] <shoky> dblosevn plz ask LordPapi :p
[10:21:34] <brend_> counting today ive been stuck for a week with mysql query
[10:22:28] <ShinyObjects> Hey all - I have a flash app that needs to know when the user clicks outside of it. It doesn't matter where.
[10:22:40] <someprimetime> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/BATXB/
[10:22:43] <someprimetime> kinda messy
[10:22:43] <dblosevn> LordPapi: Question been working on this for a few days now, I need to require iis hostable web core cgi default document staticcontent and a few other modules to be installed in before allowing my click once application to run
[10:22:55] <dblosevn> I cant seem to find anyway so far to do that
[10:22:59] <ShinyObjects> I know how to get JS talking to Flash and vs. vs, but one thing I'm having trouble with is getting the DOM to detect if the flash object has focus
[10:23:01] <someprimetime> but basically you could use the html5 file api to preview the image
[10:23:12] <someprimetime> and store the base64 endoded URI into the background-image
[10:23:20] <someprimetime> and that *would* probably work
[10:23:49] <someprimetime> jsfiddle is being slow right now though
[10:23:53] <ShinyObjects> I tried just setting up a click listener on the body object, but I  need it not to trigger when the user clicks within the Flash object
[10:24:18] <ShinyObjects> (or at least to detect that the Flash object has focus and just not do anything)
[10:24:24] <shoky> LordPapi dblosevn  ok sorry my match wasn't a good one for this q
[10:24:27] <dblosevn> ShinyObjects: I thought flash stole the click from the browser and it didnt propagte up
[10:24:36] <ShinyObjects> dblosevn: I thought so too
[10:24:37] <LordPapi> dblosevn honestly i dont know, but do u need it before installing the clickonce, or running?
[10:24:44] <ShinyObjects> dblosevn: it looks like it's still firing anyway :(
[10:24:57] <someprimetime> sunbeam: me reluctantly using codepen http://codepen.io/joe/pen/CcHbx
[10:25:14] <dblosevn> LordPapi: it doesnt matter but definitely before the app trys to usee hwc
[10:25:26] <someprimetime> re: previewing the image selected you could either upload it and do it in the success callback, or if you want to use the html5 file api https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications#Example.3a.c2.a0Showing_thumbnails_of_user-selected_images
[10:25:40] <dblosevn> LordPapi: I started writing an assembly to run one time after install but i cant seem to find a way to get a list of installed packages
[10:25:56] <ShinyObjects> If I can just detect that the click was on the Flash element though then I can do nothing when that happens. I can't figure out how to do that
[10:26:38] <dblosevn> LordPapi: I know how to install the packages from the command line but would prefer not to reconfigure iis, if its already installed, and only add the packages i need
[10:26:52] <LordPapi> oh
[10:26:59] <dblosevn> LordPapi: so getting that list is killing me lol
[10:27:09] <LordPapi> heh
[10:27:15] <dblosevn> can use pkgmgr to install the packages
[10:27:16] <LordPapi> sory i cant help
[10:27:44] <dblosevn> :-( its all good ill try another indian on elance, burned through 2 of them already this week
[10:28:17] <dblosevn> oh and one american too im on a role this week
[10:29:09] <LordPapi> lol
[10:29:23] <LordPapi> i thought microsoft was providing some api for this
[10:29:31] <LordPapi> but i dont really know
[10:29:38] <dblosevn> none that ive found
[10:29:58] <dblosevn> my app works great if i manually install HWC and the other required modules
[10:30:04] <brend_> dblosevn:  have you tried here http://forums.iis.net/
[10:30:18] <dblosevn> doesnt error at all if the modules arent installed just plain doesnt start the web server
[10:31:30] <dblosevn> i may if i cant hire somebody to do it, im not even supossed to be working on this, i just want it off my plate lol
[10:32:13] <dblosevn> ive burned more hours managing devlopers on this then were actally going to pay somebody to do it lmao
[10:33:01] <brend_> =/
[10:34:29] <brend_> damn 46 degrees today.. the hell
[10:34:50] <dblosevn> its about 80 here lkmao
[10:35:14] <halcyon1234> jqm: Can I define a show/hide transition for a collapsable?
[10:35:17] <someprimetime> it's a beautiful 57 in san francisco
[10:35:26] <Gho5t> 37. go f**** yourselves

[10:36:57] <Gho5t> mmm
[10:37:07] <dblosevn> brend_: thought you were in brazil... homey just got back from down there said it was hot hot hot
[10:37:09] <aniasis> what happened to #jquerymobile?
[10:37:30] <halcyon1234> aniasis: Folded into #jquery
[10:37:32] <aniasis> ajpiano, what's up
[10:37:34] <dblosevn> aniasis: they prolly depreciated that too :-P
[10:38:11] <brend_> dblosevn:  i was in brazil last week doing a workshop.. it was hot.. but today is the hell here
[10:38:30] <dblosevn> ?english @ brend
[10:38:30] <bot-t> brend, Ingles por favor English Please Anglais s'il vous plait Englisch bitte..
[10:39:05] <brend_> haha
[10:39:19] <brend_> Im i typing chineese?
[10:39:30] <dblosevn> ... but today is the hell here...
[10:39:36] <dblosevn> whats that even mean
[10:39:52] <brend_> here is extremely hot
[10:40:08] <dblosevn> oh 46 celcius?
[10:40:19] <brend_> right
[10:41:53] <dblosevn> i keep forgetting we had to make up our own unit of measuremnet for everything lmao
[10:43:11] <brend_> time for a cold corona
[10:43:32] <NoiseEee> where is 46C and also stocks corona?
[10:43:38] <NoiseEee> nowhere
[10:44:26] <sunbeam> dblosevn: one question, when i modify the size of the input field (thats on opacity: 0) I still can only trigger the browse when i click on a certain area of the image
[10:44:57] <dblosevn> sunbeam: most browser will trigger the dialog if you click anywhere on the input
[10:45:16] <sunbeam> yea but outside (the image is bigger than the input) it wont
[10:45:18] <dblosevn> sunbeam: older versions of ie might be an exception
[10:45:39] <dblosevn> sunbeam: resize the input...
[10:45:50] <sunbeam> i did
[10:45:59] <dblosevn> resize it bigger?
[10:46:27] <sunbeam> .upload-file-container input{opacity: 0; filter: alpha(opacity = 50); width: 140px !important; height: 105px !important; display: block;}
[10:47:14] <sunbeam> it will only resize the browse button, but max width of 40px
[10:48:02] <sunbeam> is there another input type apart from file?
[10:48:08] <sunbeam> that can trigger the file upload diaglog
[10:48:10] <sunbeam> dialog
[10:48:15] <dblosevn> plenty of other types only one of them are a file input
[10:48:41] <sunbeam> hmm
[10:49:24] <dblosevn> and file doesnt support the click event so your basically screwed if you cant make the file input the size of the image
[10:49:55] <dblosevn> ive never tried to make it that big before but ive always been able to get it big enough to work for me
[10:50:27] <sunbeam> its strange that you cannot modify the height of the box where the file name is in
[10:50:35] <sunbeam> or even hide it
[10:50:40] <sunbeam> so only the browse button appears
[10:51:33] <sunbeam> the only way is to clone it, and set 3 absolute positions
[10:51:37] <sunbeam> but that's like really ugly
[10:52:39] <dblosevn> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/MNEdP/ I made mine 1024x600 dont see what your issue is
[10:53:04] <sunbeam> dblosevn: click outside the browse button
[10:53:10] <sunbeam> and outside the input field with red background
[10:53:12] <dblosevn> works in the entire document area
[10:53:25] <sunbeam> not on ff 17.1
[10:53:26] <dblosevn> any where i click pops the  file dialog
[10:53:31] <dblosevn> ff is gay
[10:53:34] <sunbeam> lol
[10:53:38] <dblosevn> use chrome like normal people
[10:53:49] <tw2113> fuck chrome
[10:54:06] <dblosevn> at least chrome is compliant
[10:54:49] <dblosevn> firefox used to be close but now... its shit and has been for over a year
[10:55:06] <misteroneill> for exampleâ€¦ ?
[10:55:30] <sunbeam> for example what dblosevn just demonstrated :)
[10:56:39] <dblosevn> misteroneill: firefox if even possible has gotten even more horrible at memory management, crashes all the time, doesnt render stuff properly, shall i go on?
[10:57:17] <systemfault> The only thing that firefox is good at.... font rendering.
[10:57:23] <systemfault> Chrome sucks at that.
[10:57:38] <awc737> is it possible to set a form type="file" to a file with jquery?
[10:58:31] * tw2113 is on Firefox 19.02a
[10:58:44] <tw2113> oops 19.0a2
[10:58:54] <misteroneill> dblosevn: i'm not 100% sure about the "render stuff properly" but i've never had a problem. memory problems/crashing having nothing to do with "compliance"
[10:59:17] <sunbeam> dblosevn: btw the solution seems styling the label
[10:59:26] <tw2113> Chrome users thing every other browser is inferior
[10:59:33] <dblosevn> misteroneill: it used to be if you developed for firefox it worked in everything except ie, thats no longer anywhere near the case
[11:00:27] <dblosevn> sunbeam: ya that would work dont know why i didnt think of that
[11:00:52] <dblosevn> then firefox comes out with 8 major releases in less then a year and now this is what we got
[11:01:21] <misteroneill> i guess i don't experience nearly as many problems - or any problems - with firefox that you do
[11:01:30] <dblosevn> more then 8 actually they were at 7.0 the beginning of last year, there at what now 19?
[11:01:31] <misteroneill> memory, sure
[11:01:44] <misteroneill> they're just doing what chrome does
[11:01:49] <misteroneill> (version-wise)
[11:02:04] <dblosevn> dont get me wrong im not exactly happy with google lately either
[11:02:17] <dblosevn> they broke the hell out of one of my apps with version 19+
[11:02:34] <dblosevn> changing there implementation of the touch events
[11:02:41] <awc737> lol wtf isÂ C:\fakepath\apple-touch-icon.png
[11:02:47] <awc737> I'm not even on windows
[11:02:56] <awc737> that isÂ alert( $(this).find(':input[name="file-1"]').val() )
[11:02:57] <dblosevn> hence fakepath?
[11:03:05] <tw2113> anyone complaining about how fast Fx's version inflated, and saying to use chrome instead, is a blind hypocrit
[11:03:14] <awc737> where did javascript even get that from though?
[11:03:32] <tw2113> google just managed to hide the version # better and never mentioned it
[11:03:48] <sunbeam> dblosevn: also doesn't seem to work
[11:03:49] <awc737> an I set $(this).find(':input[name="file-1"]').val() equal to a real path value?
[11:03:51] <sunbeam> damn
[11:03:54] <awc737> can* i set
[11:04:06] <NoiseEee> awc737: god no
[11:04:17] <NoiseEee> awc737: .val('/etc/passwd')
[11:04:21] <awc737> haha
[11:04:27] <awc737> wait but it would be on your own computer...
[11:04:28] <NoiseEee> .val('/system32/bad.dll')
[11:04:35] <awc737> well I guess a server 2 lol
[11:04:36] <NoiseEee> yeah well whatever, god no you cand do that
[11:04:39] <NoiseEee> cant
[11:04:41] <tw2113> why are you trying to pre-populate the value of a file input?
[11:04:51] <awc737> I am validating a form, and re-setting the old input
[11:04:55] <awc737> I'm not sure what to do for the file
[11:05:00] <NoiseEee> awc737: you don't get to do that, period.
[11:05:09] <NoiseEee> you can maybe hide one with CSS and just re-show it or something
[11:05:17] <awc737> hide one what?
[11:05:19] <tw2113> awc737, check if the value is not null
[11:06:00] <NoiseEee> awc737: dupe the original <file type='input'> or something and just css it out; then on non-validation, show it again ?  anyways not really following but you're SOL setting a file input
[11:06:29] <awc737> I don't mind not setting a file input, your right its insecure. I just need to know the proper way of not making them upload again, on validation
[11:06:31] <dblosevn> sunbeam: but get this it works in chrome, safari, opera, and ie suprisingly it doesnt work in the almighty ff lmao

[11:09:16] <awc737> does this look right?Â } else if ($(input).is('file')) {
[11:09:21] <dblosevn> ooo this is a hell of a hack but you could make the input follow the mouse on mousemove over the image lmao

[11:11:34] <Katemare> hello! I'm using Wikiembed plugin for Wordpress to embed MediaWiki articles into blog. it divides an article into sections and represents thew as tabs. by default, the first tab is selected. I need that by default no tab would be selected. I'm googling it for an hour or so... would be glad for help!
[11:12:42] <brend__> damn stackoverflow
[11:13:00] <awc737> } else if ($(this).attr('type') == 'file') {...
[11:13:15] <eddiemonge> awc737: no
[11:13:23] <awc737> lol
[11:13:35] <awc737> i will try again
[11:13:50] <awc737> wait this workedÂ } else if ($(input).attr('type') == 'file') {
[11:14:45] <Katemare> I've already tried the first and only related Stackoverflow solution. it doesn't seem to affect the situation.
[11:14:52] <awc737> eddiemonge that last one looks proper?
[11:15:01] <misteroneill> awc737: .is(':file')
[11:15:09] <misteroneill> that also works
[11:15:12] <misteroneill> or should :)
[11:15:21] <eddiemonge> Katemare: is that a jquery plugin?
[11:15:36] <Katemare> yes. it uses jquery.
[11:15:44] <awc737> thanks misteroneill i Like it
[11:16:01] <Katemare> you can see the page in question here: http://rpgverse.ru/wp/?p=51
[11:16:44] <brend__> uff russian
[11:17:08] <Katemare> sorry %)
[11:20:43] <eddiemonge> Katemare: if no tab is selected, then whats shown
[11:21:36] <dblosevn> sunbeam: ha works in all browsers http://jsfiddle.net/8gZG7/3/
[11:22:13] <Katemare> eddiemonge: just tabs. no content until you click a tab. that's what I want to see.
[11:26:03] <eddiemonge> Katemare: just add a class of ui-tabs-hide to the first one shown when tabs is called
[11:26:43] * shay eats shesek 
[11:26:52] <ohgr> I'm having an issue with slideDown() forcing the element to be display:block. Ive searched Google, and came across a suggestion to force the display:inline-block within the callback of the slideDown(). that did not seem to work, so i tried another that suggested wrapping the element in a div styled display:none - http://jsfiddle.net/d3BHL/2/ is the example I followed. however, this simply hides
[11:26:52] <ohgr> my element even though i have it set to display:inline-block
[11:26:54] <Katemare> I tried that. it seems that tab-setupping script removes it.
[11:27:11] <ohgr> if anyone has any tips to get the slide to not go display:inline-block, it would be super appreciated!
[11:27:21] <ziz_> hey guys can any of you recommend a Paralax plugin/tutorial ?
[11:27:23] <dblosevn> awc737: select is a select not an input type=select file is an input[type="file"] is .is('input[type="file"]') would work

[11:29:11] <awc737> thanks is[:input also worked
[11:31:16] <Katemare> I have to go now. if someone can suggest a solution, please, PM it to me. I'll also visit later. thank you!
[11:31:22] <dblosevn> ya, but that will just tell you if its an input not if its a file input
[11:31:25] <hlve[workaholic]> any reason why a ajax post would return a 405 Method Not Allowed, other than something serverside that may or may not be blocking it?

[11:34:32] <NoiseEee> hlve[workaholic]: what are you trying to do?
[11:34:38] <NoiseEee> what method are you using?
[11:35:24] <ezrafree> hello
[11:35:33] <mattvanhalen> hi, so i'm using the autocomplete plugin, but i basically just want to use the matcher. i don't want the dropdown to display when the user types - i'm going intercept the event. but i can't find a way to stop the dropdown from showing up.  any ideas? i can't find any options to stop it, and i don't want to simply hide it with css, because it'll still make the dom element and take resources to do so
[11:35:52] <ezrafree> is there anything special I have to do to get jquery to find html that i've dynamically generated?
[11:36:32] <ezrafree> i have two dialogs, one which the html is hardcoded, and the other I am generated the html in my jquery, and the latter does not seem to be submitting the file upload properly
[11:37:04] <NoiseEee> ezrafree: different forms?
[11:37:14] <ezrafree> NoiseEee: yes
[11:37:23] <NoiseEee> ezrafree: check the enctype on the one that isnt working?
[11:38:15] <ezrafree> yeah the enctype is the same, the markup for the two forms is identical
[11:38:54] <ezrafree>  simply put the html into the DOM in jquery on one form, and i hardcode the html in the html document on the other form
[11:38:58] <NoiseEee> so you've got enctype='multipart/form-data' on both then ezrafree?
[11:39:05] <ezrafree> NoiseEee: correct
[11:39:14] <NoiseEee> and what do you mean by "does not seem to be submitting the file upload properly" ?
[11:39:41] <NoiseEee> and how are they being submitted?  paste some relevant code perhaps
[11:41:36] <ezrafree> NoiseEee: i am submitting the form to an iframe, in one case from within a dialog modal (jquery-ui dialog modal), and in the other case i am submitting the form through the html
[11:42:17] <NoiseEee> i have 0 history with -ui, try debugging i guess
[11:42:19] <NoiseEee> !fix
[11:42:27] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:43:10] <ezrafree> np, i am mainly just asking whether or not it's possible that html which I placed in the DOM through jquery, would have trouble being accessed in comparison to markup which is hard coded
[11:43:33] <NoiseEee> it wont have problem being accessed, but it might not have the event listeners/handlers you're expecting
[11:43:41] <ezrafree> i feel like i've run into this before and that's been my experience, so i was just looking for some comments or validation
[11:43:57] <ezrafree> NoiseEee: i see, okay that's a good start then
[11:44:08] <NoiseEee> ie: if you're assigning events handlers when the page is loaded and before the form exists, unless you use event delegation, the new stuff won't have the handlers attached
[11:44:12] <BabySuperman> I do $.ajax with jsonp to get some data, I can see in chrome debugger I'm getting a 200 response and the data--but I get a parsererror.  I'm not trying to do actual jsonp, i just have to use thatm ethod because the server only returns a response for that kind of request (get/post/everything else fails)
[11:44:22] <BabySuperman> How do I get that response info even if I'm getting parsererror?
[11:46:15] <brend__> NoiseEee:  thats ur site?
[11:46:49] <NoiseEee> brend__: no
[11:47:01] <brend__> i like the slider effect
[11:48:58] <Fidelix> Hello! Why can't I do something like var some = $(this).closest('tr'); some.remove();
[11:49:25] <NoiseEee> i give up, why can't you Fidelix?
[11:49:45] <BillCriswell> Fidelix: You can.
[11:49:59] <Fidelix> BillCriswell: I tried. Let me try again...
[11:50:37] <BillCriswell> Fidelix: You're trying to get the closest parent and not the closest child, right? That's something that threw off a coworker earlier.
[11:50:48] <Fidelix> BillCriswell: that's right.
[11:50:54] <BillCriswell> Ok, then you got it right.
[11:52:08] <Fidelix> Well, when I try that my whole js stops working. No errors on the console.
[11:52:34] <BillCriswell> Fidelix: We need to see some code.
[11:52:50] <Fidelix> BillCriswell: with pleasure. http://paste2.org/p/2570248
[11:53:56] <Fidelix> e.preventDefault stops working immediately after I do that.
[11:55:27] <BillCriswell> Fidelix: What if you put that at the end of the function?
[11:57:08] <coder7ofnine> i woul dlike to bind this (which is a class) to a slider slide function
[11:57:39] <coder7ofnine> slide: function(e, ui) { this.update(e,ui) },  where this is my class
[11:57:39] <Fidelix> BillCriswell: I found the problem
[11:59:01] <Fidelix> You see... I can't set the variable to $(this).closest('tr'); because this will be something else in the ajax context.
[11:59:31] <Fidelix> Instead I need to copy the current context of this, like: var clicked = this;
[11:59:39] <Fidelix> And only then set var row = $(clicked).closest('tr');
[11:59:54] <NoiseEee> Fidelix: you might as well cache that too since you're looking it up twice
[12:00:09] <Fidelix> NoiseEee: what do you mean? What am I looking up twice?
[12:00:27] <NoiseEee> Fidelix: line 31 should be row.find(<etc>)
[12:00:40] <Fidelix> NoiseEee: yeah, I changed that.
[12:01:01] <Fidelix> Thanks for your time!
[12:01:05] <Fidelix> BillCriswell++
[12:01:06] <Fidelix> NoiseEee++
[12:04:15] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:04:18] <shoky> BabySuperman: have you tried using multiple datatypes?   e.g. dataType: 'jsonp text'
[12:04:42] <BabySuperman> shoky, no what the hell! lol
[12:05:21] <shoky> read about it in the $.ajax 'dataType' docs, i'm not sure thats what you're looking for but maybe
[12:05:54] <BabySuperman> shoky, It gets "success" status now :)  but, I still cant access the data anywhere it seems, hrmm
[12:06:20] <shoky> is your success callback being called?
[12:07:19] <BabySuperman> shoky, the API im using is broken, it only works with jsonp but it isn't jsonp, so it wont wrap the request in the callback
[12:07:29] <shoky> uh
[12:07:36] <BabySuperman> shoky, at least based on myunderstanding of JSONP,I just have to wait for the server designer to fix the problems
[12:07:47] <shoky> what does "works with jsonp but isnt jsonp" mean
[12:07:57] <BabySuperman> shoky, doing a regular $.getJSON returns 301 status error, but ajax + JSONP gets 200 + I can see the response text, but I can't access it anywhere
[12:08:01] <shoky> if it doesnt wrap the response in a callback.. its not jsonp
[12:08:08] <BabySuperman> yep.
[12:08:09] <BabySuperman> it's not jsonp
[12:08:13] <BabySuperman> but im sending a jsonp request
[12:08:19] <BabySuperman> <script src=...>
[12:08:39] <BabySuperman> that allows me to get the data, but regular AJAX requests fail... for some reason he misconfigured the server and im waiting for him to fix it
[12:08:48] <BabySuperman> this was working in the mean time, kinda, but i can't get the response data
[12:09:27] <shoky> that's the point..
[12:09:49] <shoky> jsonp allows you to get at the data because the assumption is the server wraps it in a callback ..
[12:10:29] <shoky> you should be using CORS headers
[12:10:33] <shoky> instead of JSONP
[12:10:51] <shoky> and if you wanna do JSONP, server must support it
[12:15:28] <BabySuperman> shoky, yep I understand that
[12:15:40] <BabySuperman> shoky, how do I set CORS headers?  googling
[12:16:06] <shoky> that's the server guy's job
[12:16:08] <iamtakingiteasy> hello, as far as i understood, the <jquery input>.val('some nasty value with html special symbols like ", < or >') performs some kind of escaping, replacing '"' with '&quot;' for instance. what kind of escaping exactly it is performing and how do i do the same without soem awful hack like this one:
[12:16:10] <shoky> ?g enable CORS
[12:16:11] <bot-t> shoky, enable cross-origin resource sharing - http://enable-cors.org/

[12:17:25] <buddyquaid> can someone help with with jquery-color plugin?
[12:17:27] <iamtakingiteasy> is thare a way to mimic val()'s behaviour?

[12:23:53] <buddyquaid> shoky:
[12:23:55] <shoky> i dont know what you're doing exactly.
[12:24:25] <buddyquaid> basically exactly what you just did. I get an RGBA from php that the user sets and need to put it in css
[12:25:16] <shoky> buddyquaid: works for me.

[12:29:14] <wumbei> hi
[12:29:42] <wumbei> hello?
[12:30:15] <tw2113> hi
[12:30:28] <BillCriswell> howdy?
[12:32:56] <buddyquaid> so using itâ€¦ if I wanted to take a php value and set the background color I would do this? jQuery("#mydiv").css("backgroundColor" : jQuery.Color('<?=$mycolor ?>')"); ??
[12:33:19] <NoiseEee> buddyquaid: uh but the php has already been written
[12:33:37] <buddyquaid> yesâ€¦ Hmmâ€¦..what to do.
[12:34:03] <buddyquaid> set a variable before this in javascript?
[12:34:11] <buddyquaid> or sameproblem.
[12:34:52] <tw2113> buddyquaid, what is in $mycolor and when is it set?
[12:34:59] <gx_> anyone a jquery expert that can help me figure out why a form wouldnt be submitting in IE8? It's something i'd have to share via pm
[12:35:17] <tw2113> and are you trying to grab values in the browser window and convert after php has already been run?
[12:35:41] <buddyquaid> tw2113: $mycolor is set by the user in their settings. It comes in as rgba value
[12:35:53] <tw2113> k
[12:35:54] <buddyquaid> example: rgba(124, 128, 143, 0.721569)
[12:36:19] <tw2113> so echo $mycolor; // rgba(124, 128, 143, 0.721569);
[12:36:28] <systemfault> :/
[12:36:50] <systemfault> Inline JS produced by PHP... really?
[12:37:06] <danheberden> systemfault: heh, and styling information no less
[12:37:52] <tw2113> that's a long string of text
[12:39:07] <systemfault> If it's really dynamic, you could at least echo that color in the data attribute of some tags then retrieve it with JS to finally apply it as a background.
[12:39:52] <wumbei> I'm having a problem with getJSON(). it keeps returning null even though the file it's linking to has data inn it
[12:40:09] <tw2113> systemfault, i think the bigger challenge at the moment is getting rgb to hsl

[12:42:05] <awc737> but in concept, you know what I'm doing, and you pointed out the security issue
[12:42:21] <awc737> I'm not concerned with the language that is executing the upload, just the fact of whats happening

[12:46:25] <bartmax> i have a $(document).ajaxError(function () ... ) way to catch all not cached ajax errors on site. this function is global, problem is, when i navigate in the middle of an ajax request (hence an abort) the function is also called and displays as an error. Question is: is there a way to catch only 'errors per se' without the abort ones or somehow to determine at function runtime if the error was actually an error or an abort and don't fire up the error if
[12:46:47] <wumbei> shoky: well it doesn't show anything on the page

[12:51:03] <gx_> that was based off example code for the stripe api, not sure exactly. but if i take it out, it doesnt work right
[12:51:13] <shoky> gx_:  and.. calling .submit(...) like that doesnt submit the form, it sets a submit event handler.

[12:55:23] <shoky> does it even find the form?
[12:55:50] <shoky> anyway if you dont get it, set up a testcase on jsfiddle
[12:55:50] <gx_> thats what im wondering about
[12:56:01] <shoky> console.log( form$.length )
[12:56:19] <gx_> ok, ill try that out
[12:56:31] <gx_> so far form$[0] submits in ff, so im trying in IE8 now
[12:57:15] <bartmax> readystate 4 vs readystate 0 can be ?
[12:59:25] <gx_> no dice, ill try in jsfiddle although im not really sure how ill be able to set it up. lots of different stuff going on w/ stripe api
[13:00:11] <shoky> minimal testcase is best
[13:00:18] <shoky> no stripe api needed, whatever that is
[13:01:06] <gx_> stripe.com
[13:02:07] <bartmax> ok, checking against 0 or 4 works, not sure if the best way tho
[13:02:40] <gx_> shoky, forgive me for being such a novice, but is there an easy way to see if the form is registered in the dom?
[13:02:53] <gx_> i looked in firebug but there is so much info im not sure what to look for
[13:03:39] <shoky> what do you mean , registered in the dom?
[13:03:57] <shoky> exists in the dom?
[13:04:08] <shoky> that's what the  console.log( form$.length )  was for
[13:07:03] <gx_> gotcha. ok, thanks
[13:08:35] <Eviltwin> Oh God
[13:08:43] <Eviltwin> $ as a variable name suffix now?
[13:11:09] <santa4> yes/
[13:11:12] <santa4> .
[13:14:08] <BillCriswell> Never seen it as a suffix.
[13:14:12] <BillCriswell> Looks really weird there.
[13:15:21] <sunbeam> is there a nth-child selector where you can select 1-6 wityh?
[13:15:26] <sunbeam> or a way to do this i mean?
[13:15:41] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: jQuery or CSS?
[13:15:50] <BillCriswell> You can do :lt(7) in jQuery.
[13:16:20] <sunbeam> css
[13:18:23] <BillCriswell> li:nth-child(-n+6)
[13:18:55] <sunbeam> ahh thanks
[13:18:56] <BillCriswell> sun ^
[13:18:58] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:19:55] <BillCriswell> You could actually want :lt(6) with jQuery.. forget about 0 all the time.
[13:20:18] <hlve[workaholic]> any reason why a ajax post would return a 405 Method Not Allowed, other than something serverside that may or may not be blocking it?
[13:20:27] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://jsbin.com/uguziz/1/edit if you need to mess arond!
[13:22:09] <sunbeam> thankss
[13:22:39] <sunbeam> and each of 7? like 7, 14, 21 etc
[13:24:45] <BillCriswell> :nth-child(7n) would get every 7th element.
[13:25:34] <sunbeam> ok thanks
[13:25:47] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://css-tricks.com/useful-nth-child-recipies/ this is a nice compilation of useful ones.
[13:25:55] <sunbeam> thanks let me read
[13:26:20] <BillCriswell> Chris does a really good job of making clear examples.
[13:27:59] <sunbeam> btw one more thing, i think html5 provides such support but its not possible cross-browser, when i pick an image file with file selector, i want it to be as background of a certain div,
[13:28:22] <sunbeam> is there a way to do this, as action when the user selects a file with the file browser?
[13:28:33] <sunbeam> (input file i mean)
[13:29:02] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Not sure. I'd need to mess around with a bit. Don't have much support with that.
[13:29:12] <BillCriswell> much.... fuck waht work am I looking for.
[13:29:14] <BillCriswell> Oh, experience.
[13:29:51] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: probably with the file api, yeah
[13:30:53] <sunbeam> hehe
[13:30:55] <sunbeam> ok
[13:31:03] <BillCriswell> Ah, there is an #html5, nice.
[13:31:37] <sunbeam> IE has no file API support yet damn
[13:31:58] <tw2113> IE doesn't even have decent debugging tools
[13:32:27] <NoiseEee> http://www.htmlfivecan.com/ is awesome
[13:33:53] <sunbeam> too bad, like for most new html5 features theres some js lib/plugin that provides cross browser support for it
[13:34:10] <NoiseEee> or you can decide IE doesn't get it
[13:41:07] <sunbeam> hmm
[13:41:25] <sunbeam> yea I can just put a box below that when a new file is selected
[13:41:29] <sunbeam> do you know what event that is?
[13:41:44] <gx_> shoky: so in IE8, form$.length = 0, in other browsers, length = 1
[13:42:17] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: 'change' event of the input type='file'
[13:42:57] <sunbeam> ok
[13:44:53] <BillCriswell> I'll need to read about this Filesystem stuff NoiseEee
[13:48:41] <veQue> http://www.doxdesk.com/img/updates/20091116-so-large.gif
[13:51:10] <kripster> could someone help with the following scenario(http://jsfiddle.net/Ztv7t/4/) i want to on the click of a radio button to collapse?? any ideas please
[13:51:36] <ziz_> hey guys can any of you recommend a Paralax plugin/tutorial ? easy to use / understand ?
[13:53:56] <kripster> anyone help with the following scenario? http://jsfiddle.net/Ztv7t/4/
[13:54:27] <shoky> gx_: then the issue is not with the .submit() call, it's something else
[13:55:22] <gx_> yeah, i figured out why IE8 didnt recognize the form, I had an extraneous "<- in the parent element
[13:56:54] <kripster> anyone give advice to a newbie http://jsfiddle.net/Ztv7t/4/
[14:00:22] <dblosevn> sunbeam: did you see my working crossbrowser solution i sent you earlier?
[14:06:23] <Bankzilla> veQue that's awesome lol
[14:06:43] <veQue> ^_^
[14:12:43] <ogk1000> whats a good simple pastebin for JS ?
[14:12:45] <tab1293> is there a function in jquery similar to prevUntil() which traverses up through the sibling elements in the tree but instead of selecting all the elements until the specifier,  just selects the specifier element?
[14:13:06] <NoiseEee> " up through the sibling elements " ?
[14:13:38] <tab1293> NoiseEee: whoops not up just searches them
[14:14:12] <NoiseEee> doesn't siblings([selector]) do that?
[14:14:16] <tab1293> preceeding sibling elements
[14:15:51] <ogk1000> I am concerned this might be bad practice, any thoughts on how to do this better? http://collabedit.com/cnfr5
[14:17:28] <therealk_> Does anyone know of any plugins for jquery that allow you rotate a div, similar to raphael free transform http://alias.io/raphael/free_transform/ ,but of course not in svg world
[14:17:53] <ogk1000> therealk_, http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-rotation-animation-plugin/full_screen_preview/2696696
[14:18:03] <ogk1000> jedimind, can you peep that link I posted above?
[14:28:49] <therealk_> Any ideas on a good way to draw a line between the center of the div and the rotate handler, as in the free transform?
[14:41:44] <joshsmith> $('#NoiseEee .pants').slideDown('fast')
[15:03:04] <laprice> can someone tell me where I'm going wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/kjnXw/1/ ??? I should see a three bar chart.
[15:29:04] <shoky> laprice: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/kjnXw/7/
[15:30:16] <veQue> i want a toggle button that clear/undo  it should clear data from textinputs and replace them
[15:30:33] <veQue> best way is toggle?
[15:31:25] <veQue> i think i got this
[15:32:04] <shoky> laprice:  and if you wnt to keep using .setData, then call .setupGrid() afterwards before .draw()
[15:35:15] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/23
[15:35:29] <veQue> oh wait
[15:35:36] <veQue> dont look at that i forgot the $
[15:35:54] <veQue> got it
[15:36:01] <shoky> too late
[15:45:23] <lizardbrain> easist way to parse json string into object?
[15:46:54] <coldhead> JSON.parse(str)
[15:49:10] <shoky> and hardest?
[15:50:35] <laprice> shoky: Ah, I didn't have the right number of brackets around the data [[0,0], [0,0], [0,0]] not [[[0,0], [0,0], [0,0]]] ; thank you.
[15:51:10] <coldhead> shoky: writing your own regular expression engine and then writing a regex to parse it
[15:51:35] <shoky> now, what's the middle path?
[15:52:18] <Caelum> is there something like an onClose: function() {} option for jquery-ui's dialog?
[15:52:26] <shoky> Caelum: for sure
[15:52:36] <shoky> Caelum: did you check the API docs
[15:52:49] <shoky> events, specifically
[15:53:34] <Caelum> ahh I just pass a close: option, now I get it
[15:53:48] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/24/ hi cant get the button itself to change
[15:53:55] <veQue> i've tried many many things
[15:54:22] <veQue> tried this keyword, tried css tried .height .text .html
[15:54:24] <veQue> nothing
[15:54:35] <shoky> veQue: 'color' is for text color
[15:54:37] <veQue> the text input changes but not the button itself
[15:54:51] <veQue> shoky: shouldnt that change the "Hi" then at least?
[15:55:16] <shoky> no, because jqmobile adds other elements which actually contain the "Hi"
[15:55:24] <veQue> crap!
[15:55:26] <veQue> thanks
[15:55:38] <veQue> what about css height?
[15:55:54] <Caelum> why does returning false form an onsubmit handler scroll the page to the top, and how do I stop that
[15:55:54] <shoky> you'd still be only changing the #button element
[15:56:28] <shoky> veQue: i'm sure there are better ways to style jqmobile stuff.. dont know how myself sry
[15:56:38] <veQue> hmm because in my actual code it does everything i want but change the button
[15:56:41] <coldhead> shoky: eval() is the middle path
[15:56:55] <veQue> i just want to change it from Clear to undo and change the actual color
[15:57:11] <shoky> coldhead: nice. i learned a lot today, and i'm also a better person now.
[15:58:17] <coldhead> and for my part, i have a surfeit of nose grease
[15:58:40] <shoky> veQue: you should probably look deeper in the jqmobile docs, and google for best ways to do these things
[15:58:54] <veQue> shoky: i'm on it
[15:59:01] <veQue> =o)
[15:59:13] <shoky> veQue: and when you ask about it here make sure you mention that it's jqmobile related
[16:00:43] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/WZ9pf/ ok i think i found something helpful
[16:01:13] <shoky> css is winnarz
[16:04:07] <Caelum> my page was scrolling to the top because I had <a href="#"> DUH
[16:04:18] <coldhead> lol
[16:05:06] <Caelum> I just made a cool thingie with a dialog, and when you close it it scrolls to the required field and focuses it
[16:06:08] <shoky> <3 cool thingies
[16:06:22] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, cool thingies are pretty... cool
[16:12:52] <veQue> shoky: ahah!
[16:13:08] <veQue> apparently the ui from mobile adds spans all around
[16:13:58] <shoky> orly
[16:15:29] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/y39QP/26 yeh i partially fixed it.. just need to narrow down the selector
[16:18:01] <donburks> Does anyone have experience with detecting swipe events in jQuery Mobile?
[16:18:10] <ryanneufeld> donburks: yup
[16:18:11] <ryanneufeld> I do
[16:18:21] <ryanneufeld> im?
[16:18:25] <donburks> Deal.
[16:34:41] <lizardbrain> https://gist.github.com/6b3409e914c9105a496f
[16:34:48] <lizardbrain> need help with $.ajax
[16:35:01] <lizardbrain> look for alert('this never fires');
[16:35:07] <lizardbrain> i dont get that alert
[16:35:18] <lizardbrain> i see the request for http://10.1.0.1:3990/json/status?lang=en in webconsole
[16:35:58] <lizardbrain> i put the json the url replies in comment
[16:36:02] <lizardbrain> below url:
[16:41:07] <shoky> lizardbrain: and what's the status of that request?
[16:41:32] <lizardbrain> 200
[16:41:41] <shoky> lizardbrain: and is there an error in console. and change alert to console.log
[16:41:53] <lizardbrain> no errors
[16:41:58] <shoky> lizardbrain: and put a console.log also in the 'complete' callback
[16:42:07] <shoky> or add an error callback
[16:42:13] <lizardbrain> i had console.log first but tried alert as i didnt see anything
[16:42:29] <lizardbrain> complete fires
[16:42:44] <shoky> console.log(status)
[16:42:49] <shoky> add an error callback, console.log the arguments
[16:43:24] <lizardbrain> error: function(error) { console.log(error); },
[16:43:24] <lizardbrain> ?
[16:43:43] <shoky> eh. error: function() { console.log(arguments) }
[16:44:45] <shoky> arguments are (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[16:45:04] <lizardbrain> error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { console.log(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) },
[16:45:09] <shoky> sure
[16:45:24] <shoky> better yet-  console.log('ERROR', jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[16:46:03] <shoky> (you could also literally put console.log(arguments) btw )
[16:46:56] <lizardbrain>  responseText:"", status:0, statusText:"error"
[16:46:57] <lizardbrain> hmm
[16:47:05] <lizardbrain> must be parse error on json
[16:47:19] <lizardbrain> as its [HTTP/1.0 200 OK 16ms]
[16:47:50] <shoky> that json looks fine
[16:48:21] <shoky> it is.
[16:49:14] <lizardbrain> hmm
[16:49:19] <shoky> you copied that json from the actual response in the browser devtools?
[16:49:42] <shoky> mm anyway i think for a json parse error it'd say parse error
[16:49:58] <lizardbrain> g2g bbl
[16:51:03] <coldhead> bot-t: tell lizardbrain I will never forget you.
[16:51:04] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[16:51:10] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[16:51:11] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[16:51:41] <coldhead> bot-t: now that you mention it, i did sort of suspect
[16:51:42] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[16:52:04] <coldhead> bot-t: see, that's the kind of response that gives it away
[16:52:05] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/

[16:52:58] <bot-t> coldhead, #9746 (domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" to passed <script>s ... - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[16:56:41] <zuloyd> hi
[17:05:38] <coldhead> hi zuloyd
[17:05:45] <coldhead> how's it going
[17:07:18] <airdem> could it be that .hasClass does not work on $(this)? it always returns false one.
[17:08:03] <Cronoh2> id be more willing to bet you doing something wrong
[17:08:44] <airdem> Cronoh2, uploading the code. one moment please
[17:08:54] <coldhead> ?hasclass
[17:08:55] <bot-t> .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[17:08:59] <coldhead> ?is
[17:08:59] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[17:11:53] <kanja> Is there any documentation about the $.cache object? I can't find anything and accoring to chrome it's eating up like 20% of my active ram
[17:18:29] <shoky> kanja: that's where jquery stores its DOM data, such as .data(...) stuff and info about event bindings
[17:18:52] <shoky> so if you have tons of .data() stuff.. or tons of events binded.. that could be it, for example
[17:19:14] <shoky> but you won't find documentation about it, as it's internal
[17:20:57] <coldhead> you could ask #jQuery-dev
[17:21:02] <coldhead> those guys love the internals
[17:21:30] <shoky> pervs
[17:25:17] <kanja> total pervs
[17:25:44] <coldhead> ah sweet mystery of life
[17:25:48] <coldhead> can you blame them?
[17:26:35] <kanja> just enough to feel shame about it
[17:26:46] <kanja> since I do it myself
[17:26:51] <coldhead> oh sure, no question of the shame
[17:46:50] <Fallout2man> How do I hide jQuery mobile's Ajax loader?
[17:46:54] <Fallout2man> the spinner gif
[17:47:09] <Fallout2man> I tried removing it from the folder so it simply couldn't be found and it's still getting displayed.
[17:51:54] <lizardbrain> shoky ideas?
[17:51:55] <bot-t> (1 hour 50 secs ago) <coldhead> tell lizardbrain I will never forget you.
[17:52:07] <lizardbrain> lol
[18:03:05] <lizardbrain> oh wait
[18:03:15] <lizardbrain> you can't $.ajax another host can you
[18:14:17] <coldhead> no you can't
[18:14:21] <coldhead> except via JSONP
[18:14:52] <MeMReS> can i have multiple ready()'s?
[18:15:14] <tw2113> in the scope of the page or nested?
[18:15:59] <tw2113> <script>$(document).ready(function(){ });</script><script>$(document).ready(function(){ });</script>
[18:16:04] <tw2113> would be fine as far as i know
[18:16:13] <tw2113> different code in each
[18:16:15] <MeMReS> that's what im doing,
[18:16:26] <lizardbrain> $(document).ready() appends the function to an array
[18:16:32] <lizardbrain> which are all exec'd
[18:16:53] <tw2113> you should be fine MeMReS
[18:16:59] <MeMReS> using load() on a div and the code being loaded has a <script> tag
[18:16:59] <tw2113> take notes coldhead
[18:17:39] <lizardbrain> $(function(){}) == $(document).ready(function(){})
[18:17:41] <lizardbrain> iirc
[18:20:01] <MeMReS> I'm using jQuery Form, trying to figure out why it doesn't work in IE but does in FF..
[18:20:34] <MeMReS> works in chrome too.. just not ie..
[18:21:26] <lizardbrain> one of the main reasons for jq is cross-browser if something is not working in them all make sure the failing browsers are not caching old code
[18:21:34] <MeMReS> well.. that's just magical.. it decided to work in IE too..
[18:30:24] <Fallout2man> well damnit
[18:30:29] <arschmitz> Fallout2man: information for configuring defaults and calling the loader can be found at http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/methods.html and http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[18:30:32] <Fallout2man> none of the loader methods in the mobile docs work
[18:30:53] <donburks> I am fairly confident there is an error with that statement.
[18:31:00] <Fallout2man> arschmitz I've already read the docs and tried both changing the globals and tried the explicit loader hiding methods
[18:31:04] <Fallout2man> Neither of them worked
[18:31:42] <arschmitz> if you put together a jsbin with what your doing ill be happy to take a look
[18:31:51] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: What confounds me the most is that I am NOT USING AJAX. I've got a small multi-page template that's 100% local and yet when I load it into my content delivery platform (Veeva) it displays that loader gif whenever I use the menu to navigate to another page.
[18:31:55] <Fallout2man> And nothing makes it go away
[18:32:29] <coldhead> jquery mobile uses ajax for navigation by default
[18:32:33] <coldhead> you're*
[18:32:46] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: At this point I'm just going to go nuclear and write a special method to police all onloads to look for any div with .ui-loader and auto-remove it from the UI
[18:33:20] <enderx86> is there a built-in "location" variable in jQuery? e.g. $(location)
[18:33:33] <coldhead> window.location ?
[18:33:35] <arschmitz> Fallout2man: what ever works for you but the loader does work
[18:33:46] <enderx86> coldhead: i know window.location
[18:33:54] <enderx86> oh, i see
[18:34:08] <enderx86> but wouldn't it be $('location') and not $(location)?
[18:34:19] <shoky> it'd be window.location
[18:34:33] <enderx86> but you can use $(location)
[18:34:35] <enderx86> instead
[18:34:39] <enderx86> i get it now
[18:34:41] <enderx86> it's like $(document)
[18:34:52] <enderx86> coming from a java programmer, i'm not used to having these global variables, you see
[18:34:53] <shoky> except not really?
[18:34:55] <enderx86> java background*
[18:35:09] <shoky> $() can be run on any arbitrary object
[18:35:14] <coldhead> $(location) would become $('http://whatever.com')
[18:35:16] <enderx86> i know that... lol
[18:35:25] <enderx86> coldhead: thanks
[18:35:37] <shoky> in short.. no reason to ever do $(location)
[18:35:42] <shoky> unless you have your own location var
[18:35:43] <coldhead> <http://whatever.com>lol</http://whatever.com>
[18:35:47] <enderx86> I'm just not used to having these global variables. $('form') makes more sense to me than $(location) because location is a global object
[18:35:59] <shoky> $(location) shouldn't make sense to you
[18:36:12] <enderx86> but i'm looking at some code that makes use of it
[18:36:13] <coldhead> DON'T TELL HIM HOW TO FEEL SHOKY
[18:36:19] <shoky> OWWWIE
[18:36:28] <coldhead> that must be a different var location;
[18:36:31] <coldhead> which is ew
[18:36:33] <shoky> ^
[18:36:47] <coldhead> see for instance THIS GOMFUSION
[18:37:04] <coldhead> right i am going to listen to a bunch of japanese post rock for our sings now
[18:37:05] <coldhead> sins*
[18:37:21] <enderx86> shoky/coldhead: i'm staring at some code that goes, $(location).attr('protocol')
[18:37:27] <shoky> tanoshii!
[18:37:41] <coldhead> that's horrendous, enderx86
[18:37:48] <enderx86> coldhead: why is it horrendous?
[18:37:56] <coldhead> it might be a jQUery-themed plugin that deals with the location object
[18:37:57] <kanja> coldhead: any recommendations for postrock?
[18:37:59] <coldhead> but why god why
[18:38:00] <shoky> enderx86: do you understand it?
[18:38:07] <enderx86> it returns 'http
[18:38:10] <enderx86> 'http'
[18:38:13] <enderx86> for a http URL
[18:38:18] <shoky> wha
[18:38:31] <coldhead> kanja: these guys are pretty great lately http://sparkspitter.bandcamp.com/
[18:38:42] <enderx86> coldhead: why is it horrendous?
[18:39:01] <coldhead> because jQUery is for querying DOM elements and the location object is not a DOM element
[18:39:09] <enderx86> i see :-)
[18:39:16] <coldhead> if you want the protocol you access window.location.protocol
[18:39:26] <coldhead> no need to use some kind of plugin to make it look like jquery
[18:39:31] <coldhead> that's just gomfusing
[18:39:39] <Whirl3d> Hey all, shoky, coldhead, how are things?
[18:39:51] <enderx86> coldhead: is document a DOM object? if i had to guess, it would be the root DOM object
[18:39:53] <shoky> heh
[18:39:56] <shoky> it's not a plugin actually
[18:40:12] <coldhead> you are kidding shoky
[18:40:32] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MkCjT/
[18:40:32] <coldhead> YOU ARE NOT KIDDING
[18:40:36] <coldhead> WHY THE FUCK DOES THAT WORK
[18:40:40] <coldhead> HELP ME ZOMBIE JESUS
[18:40:43] <shoky> .attr defers to .prop
[18:40:49] <shoky> probably that
[18:40:58] <shoky> and prop is pretty much the same as doing location.protocol
[18:41:14] <coldhead> ?eval $(location)
[18:41:19] <bot-t> coldhead: ReferenceError: location is not defined
[18:41:24] <shoky> iz not brawser
[18:41:27] <coldhead> that is so wrong
[18:41:45] <shoky> hey Whirl3d ;] whazzup
[18:41:54] <coldhead> i am going to use this forevermore
[18:41:59] <coldhead> thanks shoky, enderx86
[18:42:01] <shoky> lawl
[18:42:03] <Whirl3d> Just trying to wrap my head around WordPress. And you?
[18:42:08] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: I'm just frustrated because I have no idea what's causing this. I've tried binding explicit calls to: $.mobile.loading('hide'); at the bottom of my pageinit, pagebeforechange AND pagechange events
[18:42:09] <coldhead> my code is going to be 70% more WTF
[18:42:18] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: Still zee spinner, it taunts me
[18:42:21] <Fallout2man> ;p
[18:42:38] <shoky> Whirl3d: same ol' ;]
[18:43:35] <shoky> enderx86:  bottom line is that just happens to work, and remains horrendous
[18:43:56] <shoky> enderx86: and it has no advantage whatsoever over 'window.location.protocol'
[18:44:04] <arschmitz> fallout2man: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/loader.html
[18:44:18] <arschmitz> there are examples of doing text only
[18:44:24] <arschmitz> to remove the gif
[18:44:33] <Whirl3d> Shoky, if you are bored and want to play around with a cool idea, I had a great idea that seems like it should already exist.
[18:45:13] <shoky> i'll surely listen if you wanna throw it my way ;P
[18:45:18] <coldhead> it has the advantage of being unreadable and funny looking
[18:45:50] <Whirl3d> Okay, so when you register at a new site, some sites lets you use your Facebook login or Google or twitter...etc.
[18:46:01] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: Actually I think I found a more ideal solution. I just used find/replace to remove all of the default html from my custom jQuerymobile file. It's just for this one presentation...should work....*crosses fingers*
[18:46:16] <Fallout2man> I don't need or want the spinner at all
[18:46:33] <Whirl3d> But I am creating a pretty extensive registration form and I don't wany my users to have to retype everything. If it already exists in their FB or Twitter or Google profiles.
[18:46:58] <enderx86> shoky: that makes sense
[18:47:35] <Whirl3d> So imagine your standard input field and then at the end (when focused), just like the (x) to clear field icon appears, you would have the twitter, google, facebook, etc. icons
[18:47:51] <Whirl3d> click on one of those icons and it autopopulates your field with those settings.
[18:48:24] <Whirl3d> the icon then becomes solid so you know where the info came from
[18:48:32] <arschmitz> body .ui-loader{display:none;} will stop it from ever showing
[18:48:37] <coldhead> i'm imagining that and i have to say it's quite a turn on
[18:48:47] <arschmitz> Fallout2man^^
[18:49:41] <Whirl3d> also, the  icons would be color if you are logged in (50% opacity if the data is available, but not used and 100% opacity if used).
[18:50:25] <Whirl3d> The remaining service icons would be 40% opacity black. Click on them and it logs you in and asks if you want to auto-fill all fields or just that one.
[18:50:48] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: I used that page to find out that $.mobile.loading( 'hide' ); was how to hide the spinner programmatically...still did not work. At this point I'm seriously starting to think this may not actually be a jQuery problem but may be a Veeva (content delivery platform) issue.
[18:51:05] <Fallout2man> arschmitz: Because I removed all of the default html and there is no way it should be getting added now...but it is
[18:51:07] <shoky> sounds like it could be a nice plugin for CMS's
[18:51:19] <Fallout2man> Hrmm.....
[18:51:21] <Fallout2man> I know
[18:51:23] <Fallout2man> firebug lite!
[18:51:30] <Fallout2man> I might be able to view the DOM that way
[18:51:37] <Fallout2man> figure out what's getting wonky
[18:52:15] <arschmitz> yeah might be to do with veeva im not familier with it
[18:57:40] <enderx86> what does div role='search' do in html5?
[19:00:13] <shoky> enderx86: i think that's an aria attribute
[19:02:57] <sylon> hi is it possible to refer to the jquery object from inside its paramters?
[19:03:01] <sylon> see this http://pastebin.com/z4iej2yk
[19:04:46] <shoky> sylon: that depends on the plugin. many times $(this) or this  is the element
[19:05:44] <sylon> shoky: this is the function that i am passing to the plugin
[19:05:59] <sylon> but i need to do something with the element the plugin is initiated on
[19:06:09] <shoky> sylon: i understand. the answer to your question depends totally on how the plugin is written and what its doing internally
[19:06:41] <sylon> shoky: ok how does it need to be written to enable this
[19:09:38] <shoky> sylon: when the plugin calls funcParam, it needs for example to set the 'this' context to the element.. e.g.  options.funcParam.call( the_element, the_id );
[19:10:54] <shoky> .call and .apply  let you set the context
[19:11:09] <shoky> sylon: read this thoroughly http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[19:16:05] <airdem> there seems to be a problem with this regexp function here http://alexandregiannini.blogspot.de/2011/05/escaping-strings-for-jquery-selectors.html
[19:16:26] <airdem> i am using it in my script but it escapes all the special chars with a single \ instead of \\
[19:16:44] <airdem> can somebody with regexp skill confirm if this expression is correct?
[19:17:47] <shoky> airdem: can you make a jsfiddle showing that happen
[19:19:38] <shoky> airdem: ah
[19:20:09] <shoky> airdem:  you only write the two backslashes if you're writing a string literal in javascript e.g:  var selector = 'bla\\bla'
[19:20:18] <shoky> ?eval 'bla\\bla'
[19:20:19] <bot-t> shoky: "bla\bla"
[19:20:23] <shoky> see.
[19:21:02] <airdem> For example, if you have an element with id="foo.bar", you can use the selector $("#foo\\.bar"). http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[19:21:10] <shoky> right.
[19:21:12] <shoky> but look:
[19:21:18] <shoky> ?eval "#foo\\.bar"
[19:21:19] <bot-t> shoky: "#foo\.bar"
[19:21:57] <shoky> one of those 2 backslashes already gets escaped away by the JS engine reading your string literal
[19:22:03] <shoky> the regex is fine.
[19:22:45] <airdem> var str = "maj^7"; $('#'+escape(str)) <-- shouldt this result in $('#maj\\^7') to work?
[19:23:54] <shoky> only 1 backslash is really needed.
[19:24:12] <airdem> hmm my code is not worming at some point. i thought it was because of the regexp
[19:24:32] <shoky> when you write your own string literal , you need to write 2, because they become the 1 needed backslash. because if you only wrote one backslash JS would think you're trying to escape the next char
[19:24:48] <airdem> yeah makes sense to me now
[19:27:15] <coder7of9> if i mousedown on my slider control then mouseup and hit the right arrow the slider control advances. how can i disable advancing if the mousedown has been relaesed.
[19:27:33] <bigmeow> hi all
[19:30:38] <airdem> shoky: line 137 is the problem. click() and addClass are not working there. https://gist.github.com/4fed016861b43e0247a3
[19:31:29] <airdem> shoky, you can reproduce the error by clicking on the 7 at "Basic Intervals" and looking into firebugs console http://www.folienrheinmain.de/GuitarChords/
[19:32:39] <airdem> there is no real error but the corresponding button match (in thiscase <button id="#maj^7">) does not get the class but only displays class="" in firebug
[19:33:08] <airdem>  <button id="#7">
[19:33:27] <airdem>  <button id="#maj^7"> if you click on maj7 instead of 7 at "Basic Intervals"
[19:36:30] <airdem> shoky, too much nonsense? :P
[19:40:23] <shoky> airdem: the regex is fine, the jquery selector is fine
[19:40:54] <shoky> airdem: and the addClass('toggle') is fine.  but after that, your each loop keeps running, and calls $('#chords button').removeClass('toggle');
[19:40:58] <shoky> so the class is removed...

[19:41:08] <bot-t> airdem, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[19:43:18] <coder7of9> if i re init a slider with new values must i first call detroy?
[19:43:32] <airdem> shoky, i feel so dumb right now ...
[19:43:38] <coder7of9> new values: step,low, high, etc
[19:43:46] <airdem> shoky, how can i exit the loop?
[19:43:48] <coder7of9> min max rather
[19:44:07] <shoky> airdem: return false;
[19:44:38] <airdem> shoky, thank you for your thinking powers. :P
[19:44:55] <shoky> :P why dont you call $('#chords button').removeClass('toggle');  only once _before_ the each loop
[19:45:25] <airdem> shoky, alos true. feeling dumber and dumber hahaha
[19:45:37] <airdem> *also
[19:45:50] <shoky> ;p at least yer progressing
[19:47:07] <shoky> coder7of9: if you just change the options (e.g. .slider('option', 'max', 500) )  then you dont need to destroy it
[19:47:49] <shoky> coder7of9: only need to destroy it if you're calling .slider({ new options here })
[19:48:05] <shoky> which is for initializing it
[19:58:34] <coldhead> good times
[20:02:19] <hugo_moss> good times?
[20:03:15] <shoky> grand
[20:05:29] <coldhead> the best of times
[20:05:41] <coldhead> shoes filling with blood
[20:09:01] <shoky> sounds wet
[20:20:28] <Caelum> I had some new shoes that really tore up my left foot to the point of bleeding. All this technology and humans still can't make shoes that don't require a blood sacrifice.
[20:26:04] <shoky> that must hurt your sole
[20:26:37] <coder7of9> when iu try to set the value option of a slider with a decimal value it always fails. is it possible
[20:27:39] <shoky> coder7of9: use a wider range of min..max
[20:29:10] <shoky> (because its not possible to use non-integer vlaues)
[20:30:26] <coder7of9> min 1 max 2.4  then if i programmaticall set 1.7 it fails .. i can change my code and do some math
[20:30:30] <shoky> coder7of9: err sorry, there's the 'step' option
[20:30:47] <shoky> you need to set  step: 0.1 for example
[20:30:54] <coder7of9> yes the slider is perfect but i i programatically set value then it fails.
[20:31:14] <coder7of9> $slider.slider(value,val)
[20:31:55] <coder7of9> $slider.slider(value,1.70)  fails so i will change to cm. odd
[20:31:57] <shoky> no.
[20:32:09] <shoky> .slider('option','value',val)
[20:32:25] <shoky> read the docs.
[20:32:40] <coder7of9> i will try. nut  $slider.slider(value,50)  does work. so it is a decimal issue
[20:32:42] <coder7of9> ok momenbt
[20:34:19] <coder7of9> same result with .slider('option','value',val)  1.70 fails and 50 works. so it appears to be a decimal issue.
[20:34:28] <coder7of9> thanks.
[20:34:33] <shoky> it works for me
[20:34:36] <coder7of9> really
[20:34:45] <coder7of9> 1.70

[20:36:23] <coder7of9> nice.something else going on then.
[20:36:30] <coder7of9> thx
[20:37:44] <coder7of9> mm this gave me an idea, i thinki know why
[20:39:11] <coder7of9> another question. is it unwise to reinitialize (init) a live slider  and if i do must i first call detroy.
[20:39:27] <shoky> its unwise if there is no reason for it ;)
[20:39:38] <shoky> and if you do it you need to destroy it first ya
[20:39:42] <coder7of9> the scale changes from metric to imperial
[20:39:45] <coder7of9> ok
[20:40:04] <coder7of9> i would prefer just tyo update
[20:40:08] <coder7of9> trying
[20:40:09] <coder7of9> thx
[20:42:02] <coder7of9> got it. thanks!!!

[20:56:43] <redengin> does jquery have an api for document.stylesheets?
[20:56:55] <snover> no
[20:57:14] <enderx86> if you type $("<tr>") and there are no <tr> elements on the page, does jquery create one?
[20:57:32] <buzzedword> enderx86: no, it returns an empty object
[20:57:33] <enderx86> oh, that would be $("tr")
[20:57:46] <buzzedword> enderx86: if you wanted to create an object, you can use $("<tr/>")
[20:58:00] <enderx86> i see...
[20:58:21] <redengin> enderx86, but you still have to insert it to the document somewhere
[20:59:57] <enderx86> appendTo
[21:00:13] <buzzedword> enderx86: right-- all you get is a new HTML element already wrapped as a jquery object, but completely detached from the DOM. Think of it as a jquerified document fragment.
[21:00:37] <enderx86> lol
[21:00:57] <coldhead> beautifully put, buzz
[21:01:21] <enderx86> coldhead, where do you get your moniker?
[21:01:32] <enderx86> it's supposed to be 'cool headed'

[21:04:47] <coldhead> enderx86: it's a long and dull story
[21:05:56] <enderx86> buzzedword: I could help you with social skills and idle chatter
[21:06:15] <enderx86> buzzedword: All you need is LOVE, love, love, love...

[21:56:36] <ruby_on_tails> whats wrong with this $("#table .listing").on("click", ".show_more", function(){});
[21:56:43] <ruby_on_tails> it says Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[21:58:07] <coldhead> sounds like $ !== jQuery
[21:59:47] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: but this works $("#table .listing .show_more").click(function(){})
[21:59:58] <coldhead> might be an old jQuery then
[21:59:59] <ruby_on_tails> i changed it to .on to get support on live elements and it threw that error
[22:00:06] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:00:10] <ruby_on_tails> yea seems so
[22:00:12] <coldhead> what's $.fn.jquery show

[22:00:16] <coldhead> ah
[22:00:21] <coldhead> ye olden days

[22:17:51] <Caelum> so our users want a minor UI change which means I have to completely redo the db design for this, blech
[22:18:09] <ejo> wow, that's some nice coupling
[22:19:42] <Caelum> well...sometimes it works out that way
[22:20:17] <veQue> @_@
[22:20:29] <veQue> i want to go to sleep
[22:20:48] <veQue> but i cant till i learn more
[22:20:56] <veQue> bah learning
[22:21:51] <Caelum> what are you learning?
[22:22:17] <veQue> well i guess i'm going back into jquery basics
[22:22:28] <veQue> trying to figure out this guys' code
[22:22:43] <veQue> keep geeting a weir error when i tried to mod his cod
[22:22:56] <veQue> i think it has something to do with global. or local variables
[22:23:09] <ejo> well that pretty much covers it
[22:23:34] <veQue> yeh
[22:23:36] <ejo> !
[22:23:46] <veQue> still it made no sense what so ever
[22:24:10] <veQue> i had a variabe and it passed thru a function and all of a sudden the variable became undefined
[22:24:12] <veQue> O_O
[22:24:35] <ejo> are you using Chrome developer tools or Firebug or something to step through it?
[22:25:08] <Caelum> variables are passed by copy in js no?
[22:25:54] <veQue> hmm
[22:26:14] <veQue> still should that matter?
[22:26:32] <veQue> the var is still defined
[22:27:48] <veQue> feels like another day wasted
[22:27:55] <veQue> i wanted to be done
[22:28:03] <veQue> days go by so fast
[22:28:43] <Caelum> days, years, lives
[22:28:57] <veQue> it's my fault.. so hard to break the ice back into my code, then when i do it's time i go to sleep
[22:29:08] <veQue> Caelum:
[22:29:19] <veQue> yeh, well to top it off toothache
[22:29:29] <veQue> minor one just to annoy
[22:29:31] <avinashrbhat> hi, all. can i add a new item into jquery.ui.menu widget dynamically after init? if not how can i achieve that?
[22:29:37] <veQue> gotta find a dentist
[22:30:43] <veQue> avinashrbhat:  you dont mean addClass?
[22:30:50] <avinashrbhat> no
[22:31:05] <avinashrbhat> i want to add a new menu item
[22:32:36] <veQue> wish i could picture it better, but if i've learned anything from learning jquery. most likely it's possible
[22:33:23] <avinashrbhat> well @veQue, the officcial document has no methods listed in it
[22:58:15] <avinashrbhat> @veQue, if you are still intrested in the solution: add the menu as you may see fit, and just call the refresh method, thanks.
[22:58:15] <b-ot> avinashrbhat, no YOU ARE still intrested in the solution: add the menu as you may see fit, and just call the refresh method, thanks.

[23:12:54] <shal3r> I have a button to download XLS file (which takes some time to generate) and i'm using jQuery to disable button after clicking it so user cannot click it twice. Is it possible to enable this button again after user gets his XLS file?
[23:16:52] <ndimatteo> hey all, I have an interesting question: Let's say I'm using this gist: https://gist.github.com/854622 in conjunction with wordpress. I need scripts to reload on an ajax call, but some script is in a js file, and some is written on the page
[23:17:11] <ndimatteo> the stuff written on the page is done so because the php is generating some of the content
[23:17:34] <ndimatteo> (ie. creating an array for jquery to use in a function call)
[23:18:20] <ndimatteo> I'm aware of a few methods but none seem to fit the bill. But I feel like I'm just missing something
[23:19:00] <ejo> wait, you said "interesting question"... then you said "wordpress"
[23:19:11] <ejo> xD
[23:19:23] <ndimatteo> that gist handles recreating the script on the page, but it will only do stuff contained between <script> and </script> as opposed to recreating links to files
[23:19:40] <ndimatteo> the other method would be just wrap all my shit in a function and initiate it again in ajax
[23:19:49] <ndimatteo> in a js file
[23:19:51] <ndimatteo> but I got both
[23:20:07] <ndimatteo> and ejo, i know i know. I need a CMS for the client
[23:20:18] <ejo> ;) just playin
[23:20:19] <ndimatteo> hence the use of wordpress
[23:20:36] <ejo> i'm in a forced-to-use-it situation too
[23:21:49] <ndimatteo> haha, I hear ya
[23:22:44] <ndimatteo> I think the main issue is that I can't just throw all my js into a function that needs reinitiated and call it when the ajax request goes through BECAUSE some of the js is being generated with the php
[23:23:18] <ndimatteo> I don't know how I could pass data from php through to a function in another js file
[23:23:24] <ndimatteo> which is why i'm just writing it on the page
[23:23:38] <ndimatteo> I feel like an idiot, there's gotta be an easier way to do this
[23:28:28] <ndimatteo> anyone have any ideas
[23:38:38] <nights> hi
[23:38:45] <nights> i cant seem to override the background color on a td by adding a "selected" class to each td...anyone know why?
[23:42:51] <karate_> hey--new to Javascript in general and i'm using jQuery to highlight Menu items on my page. I'm using .each primarily and the script works, provided the user remains on the Menu item's main page. However, if they move to a sub-Menu page, I can't figure out how to keep the Main Menu item highlighted. Could anyone help a kid out?
[23:43:10] <karate_> I'd be happy to message you my code
[23:44:27] <slite> karate_: making a jsfiddle example probably helps...
[23:45:28] <karate_> slite: thanks... i'm at jsfiddle now (never used that either!) but let me take a look and see if i can get something up real quick
[23:57:06] <oojacoboo> $("option:selected").val(); or .html() ?
[23:57:12] <oojacoboo> or .text() :P
[23:58:04] <oojacoboo> nm, I know I want val, just didn't know if option supported that method
[23:58:20] <oojacoboo> or that method supported the option element rather
[23:58:28] <aqeel> hi room
[23:58:53] <aqeel> var k = e.charCode ? e.charCode : e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which;....use this || operator..???
[23:58:59] <aqeel> please explain..
