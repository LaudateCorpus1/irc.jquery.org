[00:04:18] <baako> Hi guys if i use ajax and return a json obj from php can i then use angular js and do a for loop over the json object? or does the return have to be in a different format?
[00:07:17] <tohuw> How do I correct this function? Sorry, I’m not very JS savvy. http://jsfiddle.net/dkk35grs/
[00:08:10] <baako> tohuw: what are you trying to do?
[00:08:52] <tohuw> baako: To change the class of the element on focus or click, and revert it on unfocus. I wanted to use a function to stay DRY, but I’m not sure how.
[00:09:11] <tohuw> There may be a much easier method of doing all of this…
[00:10:10] <baako> so you want to grey out the input field when it off focus?
[00:10:54] <tohuw> baako: actually, I want to change the size of it and set some other styles, hence the class change
[00:20:43] <baako> tohuw: http://jsfiddle.net/baako/dkk35grs/1/
[00:20:50] <baako> think thats what you wan
[00:23:30] <baako> http://jsfiddle.net/baako/dkk35grs/2/ thats it
[00:24:04] <tohuw> baako: neither seem to work, in that the class does not change
[00:26:19] <tohuw> I was attempting to make a generic function to toggle classes, that I could call on blur, focus or click events
[00:36:35] <tohuw> baako: if it makes things more clear, this is the expanded version of what I’m trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/tohuw/vhsLjcdw/2/ I just don’t like the repetition.
[01:38:45] <vedu> Hello. I have $inputs that looks like a NamedNodeMap (as per its 'attributes' in the browse debugger). I can fetch the first element by $inputs.get(0)
[01:39:13] <vedu> Now I want to prepend a value to $inputs.get(0).value. How can I do that?
[02:11:48] <Poison[BLX]> vedu: I suspect you can simply do: var v = $inputs.get(0).value; $inputs.get(0).value = "prefix" + v; ... if I'm guessing what $inputs is.
[02:38:42] <vedu> Poison[BLX]: yes. thanks :)
[02:39:27] <vedu> I wasn't sure that I could do ...value = "xyz". But I cn

[03:16:00] <ilhami> hey
[03:16:43] <ilhami> I have two links because of this crap bootstrap in a dropdown. I want to check which one is selected with jquery. How should I do this? Should I give each <a> a id and then use that?
[03:17:34] <ilhami> an id***
[03:18:02] <sacho> what do you mean "which one is selected"
[03:18:27] <ilhami> I have to get the text of the protocol that is selected, either HTTP or HTTPS
[03:18:52] <ilhami> and bootstrap uses anchor tags for dropdown list items apparently.
[03:19:22] <ilhami> understand sacho ?
[03:19:47] <ilhami> it would have been easier with a normal <select>
[03:20:57] <sacho> I don't see what that has to do with determining which one is selected
[03:21:02] <sacho> or how adding ids would help you
[03:21:41] <ilhami> oh yeah that is right :D that doesn't help me much
[03:22:19] <ilhami> couldnt I make an if statement to check somehow which one is selected?
[03:23:09] <ilhami> sacho, help me out here.
[03:24:15] <ilhami> I could make an on click on each anchor?
[03:24:26] <Omar-> ilhami create a fiddle, it's easier to understand what you want
[03:24:48] <ilhami> Omar-, sure bro :P
[03:24:55] <Omar-> :)
[03:25:51] <sacho> I don't know what a "crap bootstrap in a dropdown" is
[03:26:11] <ilhami> lol
[03:26:31] <ilhami> seriously guys does jsfiddle not support bootstrap?
[03:33:08] <ilhami> http://jstraight.com/1207/1 see the dropdown menu?
[03:33:52] <ilhami> I want to get the value of the selected one.
[03:34:30] <ilhami> I don't like to work with bootstrap tbh. It's a pita.
[03:34:58] <bacobart> bootstrap a pita? sounds like you just don't understand it:P
[03:35:25] <ilhami> bacobart, it sucks. A lot of people don't like it.
[03:35:51] <ilhami> why is boostrap avoiding <select>?
[03:36:28] <bacobart> it isn't
[03:36:30] <bacobart> your code is.
[03:36:35] <ilhami> ok wait.
[03:36:43] <bacobart> you're using a dropdown menu instead of a select
[03:36:46] <sacho> ilhami, the .click() handler has the selected element
[03:36:47] <bacobart> idk why you're doing that
[03:36:52] <ilhami> Avoid using <select> elements here as they cannot be fully styled in WebKit browsers.
[03:37:06] <ilhami> From Bootstrap documentation
[03:37:17] <ilhami> Avoid using <textarea> elements here as their rows attribute will not be respected in some cases.
[03:37:22] <bacobart> not being able to fully style the select element isnt a bootstrap limitation then now is it
[03:38:03] <ilhami> it doesn't have one exampe with select in its documentation
[03:38:25] <ilhami> find me one if there is one
[03:39:34] <bacobart> you can just add a <select class='form-control'> in yoru code and have a select
[03:39:47] <bacobart> if you want to have more options in styling you'll probably have to use a plugin like chosen select or whatever
[03:40:48] <ilhami> form-control doesn't do it. I want it placed like the dropdown menu was
[03:40:58] <bacobart> yeah
[03:41:00] <bacobart> can't have it both ways
[03:41:11] <bacobart> atleast not out of the box
[03:41:25] <Omar-> ilhami simple code is $(".dropdown-menu li a").on("click", function () { value = $(this).text(); });
[03:41:43] <ilhami> Omar-, yeah never mind. That code is not valid since I have changed to a <select>
[03:41:57] <ilhami> why is it not possible to have the <select> inline?
[03:48:29] <ilhami> bacobart, it is possible :)
[03:48:31] <ilhami> actually
[03:48:34] <ilhami> I am almost there.
[03:49:24] <bacobart> ilhami, http://jsfiddle.net/brainbolt/52VtD/4/
[03:49:26] <Omar-> ilhami if select, use change instead of click
[03:49:39] <bacobart> thats an inline select in bootstrap
[03:49:41] <ilhami> bacobart, wait 2 sec.
[03:49:46] <ilhami> I have made it myself.
[03:49:56] <bacobart> ok
[03:50:34] <ilhami> want to see the code? :P
[03:50:51] <bacobart> sure
[03:51:14] <ilhami> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ea6e28fb9702f56a0e73 this did it.
[03:52:32] <bacobart> looks about right
[03:52:51] <ilhami> awesome. appreciate your help.
[03:53:25] <Omar-> ilhami http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/1dfdotfb/
[03:53:55] <ilhami> var conceptName = $('#aioConceptName').find(":selected").text();
[03:53:59] <ilhami> I think I can just use this :P
[03:54:20] <ilhami> where #aioConceptName is my select id
[03:55:04] <ilhami> yep that worked fine.
[03:55:11] <Omar-> ilhami http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/1dfdotfb/1/
[03:55:56] <ilhami> but I dont want the value on change :P
[03:55:58] <ilhami> I want it on submit
[03:56:09] <ilhami> don't worry bro. I got it.
[03:56:23] <Omar-> ilhami then do it on submit
[03:56:35] <ilhami> I did lol
[03:57:05] <Omar-> $(".whateverFormID").on("submit", function () { $("select option:selected").text() });
[03:57:37] <Omar-> ok good :)
[03:58:08] <ilhami> $("#add-url").submit(function(event) { is this wrong?
[03:58:18] <Omar-> no not at all
[03:58:23] <ilhami> does it have to be .on("")
[03:58:25] <ilhami> oh good :)
[03:58:37] <Omar-> $("#add-url") should be form ID not button
[03:58:45] <ilhami> yeah it is.
[03:58:46] <Omar-> using .on is always preferable
[03:59:12] <Omar-> if you want to delegate event, you should use .on
[03:59:30] <Omar-> for example $(document).on("event", "element", function
[03:59:33] <Omar-> this is delegation
[03:59:47] <ilhami> we will see :P so far I am fine with just .submit.
[03:59:59] <Omar-> this will add listener even to dynamically added elements
[04:00:09] <Omar-> do what you see best
[04:53:50] <arthurvr> Hi everybody!
[05:29:25] <cin_> hi
[05:31:03] <cin_> i am using v1.11.1 and ui v.1.11.3, is there any reason why i can't change the maxDate and minDate option in the selectpicker? i tried it in jsfiddle and everything is fine but in my environemnt not, i have no other js errors or something everything fine?
[08:49:54] <vibrasfear> how would i highlight an element like highlight() does in ui without ui?
[08:53:45] <vibrasfear> got it.
[08:59:08] <JFlash> hi!! anyone familiar with cheerio  ?   (scraping module for node.js)
[08:59:31] <JFlash> I'm confused why I have to use this sintax to access the text value of each node:        --->      links.first()[0].next.data
[08:59:53] <JFlash> here the code:  http://pastie.org/9947389
[09:01:36] <nodedfree> http://pastebin.com/NZrnesnZ > is that possible to insert the ajax call into function and wait until it finishes?
[09:02:39] <nodedfree> i need the function to return the ajax callback.. right now the res variable returns with the whole ajax object (instead of only the status)
[09:27:43] <nodedfree> http://pastebin.com/RaGb8zgn   >>>>  http://postimg.org/image/yfvj74w1d/   >>>> how come?! status is appeared only with the whole result object ? -.-
[09:59:12] <neredsenvy> Does $('.form-page').each(function() { ... });  ( .each(..) ) function have a hasNext attribute or a way to check if current iteration is last
[10:21:25] <BinaryKitten> neredsenvy the function you pass to each received the argument for the index
[10:22:16] <ilhami> I need a toggle slider :P
[10:22:19] <ilhami> enable disable
[10:22:21] <ilhami> you know one?
[10:22:36] <BinaryKitten> if you do var formPages = $('.form-page');  formPages.each(function(idx) { var isLast = (idx == formPages.length-1); });
[10:22:43] <BinaryKitten> @ neredsenvy
[10:23:00] <BinaryKitten> ilhami - define "toggle slider"
[10:35:15] <checkit> Hey guys... I have a a modal that I'm dynamically populating with form data (hidden on the page). The form displayed in the modal is based off of a dropdown selection... I'm using the maskinput plugin $(".year").mask("9999"); but when the form is populated within the modal the selector doesn't seem to be working.
[10:35:25] <checkit> I've had this problem before but I can't recall what the solution was.
[10:42:29] <ilhami> I need a slider I can enable and disable. You know what I mean dude? :D
[10:42:33] <ilhami> BinaryKitten,
[10:43:53] <Uhkis> so a checkbox? :D
[10:44:37] <ilhami> nooooo lol
[10:44:40] <ilhami> are you serious? :D
[10:44:57] <ilhami> you know the button you can drag left and then the app is enabled
[10:45:03] <ilhami> when dragging to the right disabled
[10:45:08] <ilhami> and you can also click it
[10:46:38] <Uhkis> so a themed checkbox
[10:48:12] <ilhami> you can call it that I guess
[10:48:13] <thinced> ilhami: so basically you want this: https://github.com/abpetkov/switchery
[10:48:24] <thinced> nice themed checkboxes
[10:50:03] <ilhami> yeah something like that :D
[10:51:07] <thinced> so there you go
[10:52:04] <ilhami> :D
[10:53:40] <ilhami> that one looks too much like iOS though
[11:01:58] <goddard> how can i assign some html variable i recieve from ajax to .html() ?
[11:12:09] <nodedfree> goddard, what do you mean exactly?
[11:21:38] <goddard> nodedfree im trying to return HTML data in my ajax success
[11:21:53] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm in a real bind here... I'm trying to figure out how I can make a multidimensional array/object to store dynamic form data... var income should be able to hold {'Primary':{'Name':'test','attr2':'foo','attr2':'bar'}, 'Secondary':{'bla':'bla'}} such that additional data belonging to either Primary or Secondary are pushed into the appropriate key... Any help please?
[11:21:53] <checkit> This is what I've got so far and it aint workin: http://jsfiddle.net/hpxjpLke/1/
[11:23:25] <nodedfree> goddard, success: function (d) { console.log(d); } will arrange your mind a bit
[11:26:12] <sacho> checkit, http://jsfiddle.net/hpxjpLke/2/
[11:26:31] <sacho> not sure what the point of income is, though
[11:35:47] <checkit> sacho: Whoa, that was fast a certainly a lot closer to what I'm looking for. Being primarily a backend developer this is the closes I can get to the example I'm looking for: http://3v4l.org/hZMOj
[11:36:50] <checkit> I am storing the stringified value of the collection in a hidden input field to be post and parsed on the backend. var income = [] is defined outside my selector/function... source is the internal object/array to store values to ultimatly push into income... i hope this makes sense...
[11:37:07] <sacho> ah
[11:37:19] <sacho> well, similarly
[11:39:44] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/hpxjpLke/4/
[11:40:27] <checkit> Holy crap dude!!! That's it!!!!
[11:41:17] <sacho> you can also do things like var Primary = income.Primary; Primary.push()..
[11:41:35] <sacho> in that sense it's similar to php
[11:42:01] <sacho> the only difference is usually you'd use an object({}) when you want an associative array(with string keys), and an array([]) when the keys are sequential numbers
[11:42:21] <checkit> sacho: You are the man! (or woman, can't tell by your username). lol
[11:43:02] <sacho> the it
[11:43:09] <checkit> So can I then take that and JSON.stringify it and shove it back in the input? And, when another item needs to be added to the index, read the string out of the hidden field and add new objects?
[11:43:41] <sacho> sure, you could do that
[11:45:20] <ilhami> anyone knows where I can find those nice enable disable sliders?
[11:47:01] <guzzlefry> ilhami: jquery-ui?
[11:47:10] <ilhami> does it have a on/off slider?
[11:47:19] <guzzlefry> oh wiat
[11:47:25] <guzzlefry> you mean a toggle switch?
[11:47:32] <ilhami> yeah whatever they are called man :P
[11:47:36] <guzzlefry> I'm not sure on that.
[11:47:37] <goddard> if i have an = sign in my json it returns null
[11:47:37] <ilhami> I don't know its name.
[11:49:29] <guzzlefry> goddard: You don't assign values in JSON with the assignment operator (=).
[11:49:37] <guzzlefry> { name: value }
[11:55:18] <eBureau> can anyone me point me in the right direction to achieve this 'soft slide scrolling effect' https://www.acamica.com/ ?
[11:57:36] <goddard> guzzlefry it is apart of my HTML not an assignment
[11:57:39] <goddard> its in quotes
[12:02:38] <checkit> sacho: Is there a way to do so something like income.{VAR}.push(); VAR being Primary or Secondary so I don't use a logic check?
[12:02:52] <sacho> income['Primary'].push()
[12:03:05] <sacho> or var prop = 'Primary'; income[prop].push()
[12:07:19] <checkit> You sir are a legend... Last thing I need to figure out is how to get that back into the form hidden field so it can be part of my post data as JSON parseable from the backend....
[12:30:53] <checkit> sacho:  You sir are a legend... Last thing I need to figure out is how to get that back into the form hidden field so it can be part of my post data as JSON parseable from the backend....
[12:31:20] <sacho> JSON.stringify(income) and assign it as the input field's value
[12:35:15] <Wolfram74> i'm just starting with jquery/javascript and some of the scoping things are eluding me
[12:35:25] <Wolfram74> I have these two snippets of code http://dpaste.com/1FF3FSC
[12:35:55] <Wolfram74> approach 2 works, but is ugly, I don't understand why approach 1 doesn't work
[12:36:39] <Wolfram74> ah, ordering
[12:36:41] <Wolfram74> ffff
[12:37:05] <Wolfram74> it's a gorram button, won't the rest of the code have loaded?
[12:42:06] <Wolfram74> not too chatty for 700 residents...
[12:52:56] <shoky> Wolfram74: it's because at line 3 add_dice is undefined still.  the function will be hoisted like you want, if you change line 5 to:  function add_dice() {
[12:54:04] <Wolfram74> but, i thought since it was a button it would be able to access methods written below it
[12:54:15] <Wolfram74> just a silly preconception to have and should be discarded?
[12:54:37] <shoky> yep. don't see what it being a button has to do with anything about javascript ;p
[12:54:58] <Wolfram74> i mean, it's a time independent call
[12:55:01] <Wolfram74> it's not serial
[12:56:13] <shoky> it's javascript. and the way you have it is equivalent to:   var add_dice = undefined;  $(...).on("click", add_dice);  add_dice = function() { ... };
[12:56:35] <shoky> the variable is hoisted, but not its initial value
[13:10:39] <Wolfram74> ho well

[13:59:48] <ntcbow> ilhami: you already asked on #web, if the request is coming from a chrome-extension it shouldn't be a request to http://localhost:4567 but rather something like chrome-extension://
[14:08:38] <ilhami> ntcbow, I see. Works now :D
[14:14:38] <ntcbow> :)
[14:22:22] <ilhami> ntcbow, :P you are an expert?

[14:26:35] <ntcbow> well then i'm a boss
[14:27:01] <ntcbow> and yes i'm a god as well
[14:27:13] <ilhami> no you are not.

[14:28:33] <ilhami> rcyr, I cannot stand disbelief tbh. :/
[14:28:39] <ntcbow> rcyr: What the hell is wrong with you, god doesn't need your help to defend "itself"
[14:29:02] <ilhami> I am allergic to disbelief.
[14:29:05] <rcyr> ilhami: The world is filled with disbelievers, deal with it.
[14:29:19] <ntcbow> ilhami: What the hell is wrong with you, god doesn't need you to define himself a god
[14:29:40] <ilhami> rcyr, true that
[14:30:18] <ntcbow> hey you can call me everything but a disbeliever!
[14:30:47] <ntcbow> in fact you can, but then your wrong again
[14:31:41] <ilhami> well in my religion you are a disbeliever.
[14:32:44] <ntcbow> hah then your religion is wrong, and you too for choosing the wrong religion
[14:32:45] <rcyr> ilhami: For your religion, more than half of the humans in the world are disbelievers. (That's if you count the so-called "sister-faiths"
[14:33:04] <ntcbow> see, here everything is fine, heavenly
[14:33:20] <ilhami> ok just stop now. Can we get back on topic?
[14:33:27] <rcyr> Sure
[14:34:09] <ilhami> fact is that this toggle switch doesn't work :s
[14:34:36] <ntcbow> any questions regarding chrome-extensions?
[14:34:36] <ntcbow> or jquery?
[14:34:54] <ntcbow> i may not be an expert, but i'll hjelp if i can :)
[14:35:12] <ntcbow> believe me ;)
[14:40:24] <ilhami> okay. can you tell me why my popup.js is not loaded?
[14:41:10] <ntcbow> how do you know it isn't?

[18:31:28] <Zixtyy> http://jsfiddle.net/pkwgq4x9/
[18:35:00] <sacho_> what's slidedown
[18:39:21] <Zixtyy> http://api.jquery.com/slidedown/
[18:39:33] <Zixtyy> An animation
[18:42:43] <shoky> Zixtyy: you have an extra  });  there , caused by partial copypasting
[18:45:07] <shoky> also it's slideDown not slidedown, and slideDown only works if the element starts off hidden with display:none
[18:45:12] <Zixtyy> Aaaand it works. Cheers.
[18:46:03] <Zixtyy> Thank you for your help, knew it would be obvious. I've been borrowing code trying to get it working ._.
[19:26:38] <Wolfram74> this is peculiar, i'm toying with ajax
[19:26:38] <Wolfram74> http://dpaste.com/2NRNQ9D
[19:27:00] <Wolfram74> the error for when i run 12 instead of 11 is that data is undefined
[19:27:12] <Wolfram74> but 11 runs without misisng a step
[19:27:15] <shoky> Wolfram74:  success: modifyCell
[19:27:37] <Wolfram74> and it'll just assume it has the relevant data?
[19:27:46] <shoky> modifyCell(data) is trying to call modifyCell and pass back the return value
[19:28:14] <shoky> $.ajax will pass the data to the success callback you pass there
[19:28:36] <shoky> that's defined in the docs, no assumptions needed
[19:29:19] <Wolfram74> eventually I will gain intuition for when I'm supposed to pass vs execute a function
[19:29:34] <shoky> what you had is equivalent to:   var v = modifyCell(data);  $.ajax({..., success: v});
[19:29:40] <sacho_> you usually want to pass a function when the function you're calling expects a function parameter
[19:29:45] <shoky> written like that it should be obvious what's wrong
[19:30:25] <Wolfram74> for certain definitions of obvious, probably
[19:31:08] <shoky> it will be soon if you keep at it
[19:32:45] <Wolfram74> thanks for the spot check, shoky
[19:35:01] <shoky> ;s
[20:39:26] <Chaos3ngel> hey guys ^^
[20:42:33] <Chaos3ngel> may need a little help ^^ trying to ajax send form data on click of submit button in that form... but im trying to use a single jquery action which is assigned to a class of forms, cause i need to use same form multiple times on the same page... any solution?!
[21:04:28] <narcarsiss> sacho_: Thanks.
[23:03:39] <Prometheian> I'm return a 406 from my service and it isn't firing off ajax's failure method. Is that stricting 400?
[23:04:16] <rcyr> Prometheian: Post your code on a pastebin.
[23:04:22] <Prometheian> kk
[23:05:30] <Prometheian> http://www.hastebin.com/icexowaxig.coffee
[23:11:41] <Prometheian> Backend is returning "" and a 406.
[23:12:17] <Prometheian> hmm, it's ignoring 400 as well
[23:15:47] <Prometheian> hurr durr error not failure
