[06:38:57] <impostord> Hey. What is the standard way of escaping user input when using the $.html() method? for e.g. $foo.html('<div>' + user_input + '</div>')
[06:57:36] <Feldmaus> impostord: Use .text() instead
[07:07:52] <impostord> .text doesnt parse the html
[07:10:36] <impostord> isnt there some standard way to escape user input for html context?
[08:40:12] <Cork> impostord: .text escapes html
[09:28:51] <impostord> Cork: it also places the text in the dom
[09:29:03] <impostord> how can I simply escape the input?
[09:29:04] <Cork> impostord: sure it does and?
[09:29:33] <Cork> $('<div>').text('<script> /* hack me */ </script>').html()
[09:38:20] <impostord> thanks
[09:49:26] <impostord> Ive checked out a copy of jquery-ui. How can I build a .js dist?
[09:49:36] <impostord> I cant find any relevant grunt tasks.
[09:55:26] <Cork> have you checked the end of Gruntfile.js?
[09:55:37] <Cork> the first or second one looks like what you want
[10:04:23] <impostord> Cork: ah, thanks
[10:04:50] <impostord> I see that mgol has a few commits in the last 2 days.
[10:04:58] <impostord> possibly a new release soon?
[10:22:14] <Cork> impostord: will see wouldn't bet on it
[10:31:10] <mgol> impostord: more PRs to come, we first need to get the UI test suite pass with jQuery 3.2-3.5, for now it only mostly passes with <=3.1.
[10:33:30] <Cork> mgol: nice to hear! been very dead around jquery-ui for a long time!
[10:34:45] <mgol> I've already eliminated almost all Migrate warnings from showing up during the UI test suite, now I'm focusing on passing it with jQuery 3.2. These updates are long overdue so it takes time to do them all.
[10:40:25] <Cork> mgol: nice, thx for taking it on!
[10:50:02] <snatcher> is there a method to get disabled select/input val()?
[10:55:37] <snatcher> .val() works on disabled <input> but doesn't on disabled <select> looks like a bug to me
[10:57:27] <impostord> mgol: great work man!
[10:58:06] <impostord> I was about to fix all these jquery migrate warnings in my copy of jquery ui. but now ill just wait a bit. possibly build from dev-master myself :)
[12:47:02] <Cork> snatcher: should work wine on disabled select elements
[12:49:31] <Cork> snatcher: wfm: https://jsfiddle.net/edo6m3fn/
[14:03:56] <snatcher> my bad, also disabled <option>
[14:14:07] <destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/495uphrs/   line 23 im trying to hide add dom element, but how can i remove it please guys?
[15:46:26] <taplar> destramic: line 21 is appending the element html.  The element will not be appended to the DOM.  A copy of it will be appended to the DOM
