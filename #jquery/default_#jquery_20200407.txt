[04:17:43] <Bluerate> hello all, how to turn this javascript code into Jquery https://paste.ofcode.org/nCEvMpbcfwURAfvLQfCbgG ...
[04:34:17] <thykka> jquery is javascript code...
[04:34:40] <thykka> but there's a HTML comment inside, so it won't work
[04:34:55] <thykka> <!-- Get Employee Data -->
[04:35:00] <thykka> ^ not a valid comment in JS
[04:39:06] <Bluerate> thykka: the complete and running here https://codepen.io/dabeng/pen/xyMGrR ... specifically turn these lines to JQuery https://paste.ofcode.org/Yr7UgQM6F6vqS5xB6c3ueY  .. cause I need that to work in Odoo
[04:40:18] <Bluerate> if i tried with $("#chart-container").addClass('orgchart');
[04:40:26] <Bluerate> how to add the options
[04:56:07] <Cork> Bluerate: what does it look like before you started converting it?
[04:56:13] <Cork> cause it already looks like jquery to me
[04:56:45] <Cork> well a jqeury plugin to be exact
[05:53:52] <thykka> Bluerate, have you installed the OrgChart jQuery plugin into Odoo?
[10:47:24] <yumei> Hello there :)
[10:48:57] <yumei> I was wondering if anyone here had a method to check if jQuery was loaded (like an event to listen to), it can be done by checking "window.jQuery" with a JS timer, but I find it pretty ugly, any suggestion ? Thanks :)
[11:20:42] <makr8100> yumei: $(document).ready() won't suffice?
[11:21:19] <makr8100> I know it's not checking specifically what you're looking for, but for practicality it's usually a good way to go about it
[11:21:24] <yumei> $(document).ready()  is already using jQuery :)
[11:22:25] <makr8100> so if $(document).ready() is called then JQuery is loaded, am I right or am I right?  :P
[11:24:43] <makr8100> Do you want to fire an event or do you want to do something conditional elsewhere?
[11:25:05] <yumei> using " $ " before the library is loaded ends up with " $ is not defined ", whatever jQuery function you may use
[11:26:11] <yumei> I'm in a tough case where I'm using an external twig template with jquery inside and the cms behind this loads jquery at the very end of the page (after the twig insertion)
[11:26:29] <makr8100> Ic...  I usually load JQuery first in the header, and put my scripts that rely on the DOM in the body at the bottom.  That usually solves the issues that JQuery not being loaded causes.  You definitely need to include JQuery in front of any code that relies on it
[11:26:39] <makr8100> :|
[11:26:45] <makr8100> welp...  that was stupid of them
[11:27:18] <makr8100> ya I think you're going to have to do an ugly interval or timeout workaround
[11:27:46] <yumei> yeah cause ' document.addEventListener("load", function()  ' won't do anything for me apparenlty
[11:28:23] <yumei> Thank you anyway for your time makr8100
[11:34:17] <makr8100> yumei: I was up for some code golf, this should work (not that you wouldn't have figured it out but I was somewhat bored) https://pastebin.com/uHVrqFpv
[11:36:19] <yumei> makr8100 was about to make the exact same function, so thank you :D
[11:38:31] <yumei> I think I'll just fire an event when condition is true so every twig will be able to listen to this event before using jQuery, cheers !
[11:40:22] <yumei> Well... end of the day for me !  Take care everyone ;)
