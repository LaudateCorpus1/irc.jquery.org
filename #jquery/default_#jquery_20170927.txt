[02:20:42] <jquery396> >ppl still can't w8 until the an answer. ppl have fixed workdays
[02:23:12] <Neo1> jquery396: what does mean w8?
[02:24:05] <jquery396> see the log
[02:24:24] <jquery396> [w-eight, wait]
[02:24:42] <Neo1> ok
[02:26:48] <Neo1> jquery396: better you write full word, Here people are good know English not all
[02:27:31] <Cork> Neo1: you are correct, though it isn't about english, its irc slang and isn't specific for english
[02:27:33] <Neo1> jquery396: how correct?
[02:27:43] <Neo1> Cork: I made error?
[02:28:00] <Cork> Neo1: i just said you where correct...
[02:28:03] <Neo1> Cork: Here people are not all know English ?
[02:28:21] <Cork> the comment was about w8 be about english
[02:28:24] <Neo1> Cork: I seem it's wrong sentences
[02:28:26] <Cork> cause it isn't
[02:29:14] <Neo1> I know, but I doubt where is correct place 'all' in sentences
[02:29:42] <Neo1> all people, or people all?
[02:29:54] <Cork> the entire sentence is wrong to be honest
[02:30:09] <Neo1> Cork: and how correct?
[02:30:18] <Neo1> Cork: do correct
[02:31:01] <Cork> "it's better to not use abbreviation, as many ppl that are in here aren't good at english" or something like that
[02:31:09] <Cork> but ya, offtopic for this channel
[02:31:44] <Neo1> Cork: and you native?
[02:31:52] <Cork> no
[02:32:03] <Cork> at this hour most aren't
[02:32:13] <Neo1> Cork: and this is wholly wrong? (Here people are good know English not all)
[02:32:20] <Cork> Neo1: offtopic
[02:32:31] <Cork> try ##english or something
[02:32:54] <Neo1> Cork: ok, say just I don't know )
[02:33:36] <Neo1> Cork: simply say - I don't know how is correct, I'm not native, I am learning English too )
[02:33:55] <Neo1> Cork: passed this offtopick
[02:34:02] <Cork> Neo1: like i said offtopic, meanting drop it or take it to a chennel where it is ontopic
[02:34:11] <jquery396> anyway, fn?
[02:34:15] <Neo1> Cork: ok
[02:34:22] <Neo1> jquery396: what means fn?
[02:34:28] <Cork> ...
[02:34:36] <Neo1> jquery396: what does fn mean?
[02:34:37] <jquery396> not what, rather who
[02:34:45] <Neo1> jquery396: ok
[02:35:13] <jquery396> okay, Cork, maybe you can take a look?
[02:35:25] <Cork> jquery396: also just cause someone say "i don't have time now" doesn't mean they promise to look at it later
[02:35:40] <Cork> so i would suggest stop nagging him
[02:35:50] <jquery396> over here https://jsfiddle.net/wt0eL0xp/6/
[02:36:21] <Cork> jquery396: i did but you rejected the solution about two weeks ago so i stay away from it
[02:37:22] <jquery396> this one is a bit different
[02:37:56] <jquery396> first, semantics are even closer to reality, second, script is kinda broken because of wrong scope
[02:38:10] <jquery396> can't quite figure how to fix that
[03:31:59] <frankallen> hello, if I search only google for an actor and google shows me the movies, there is a little slider for the movie covers
[03:32:16] <frankallen> is there any plugin for a look a like/feeling?
[03:36:38] <jquery396> and here it dumps jquery guts http://jsbin.com/mexokudene/edit?html,js,console,output
[03:41:52] <jquery396> :'(
[03:51:27] <Koopz> can somebody please test the last example on the website? http://marcj.github.io/css-element-queries/
[03:52:00] <Koopz> if i understood correctly the console should be spammed with messages
[03:52:14] <Koopz> but my browsers don't do anything
[03:55:12] <Koopz> ah sorry not the performance test
[03:55:57] <Koopz> the one above
[05:00:07] <Neo1> I have error
[05:00:19] <Neo1> Koopz: can you help me?
[05:00:26] <Neo1> Moonspell, hi
[05:00:36] <Neo1> Moonspell, are you there?
[05:01:08] <Neo1> Moonspell, do  you know how unchecked checkbox?
[05:01:30] <Neo1> I am using this code and this doesn't work $('#vitamins').prop('checked', 'false');
[05:01:47] <Neo1> Here example https://codepen.io/kselax/pen/oGZqLN
[05:02:09] <Neo1> when we press check, all good, and we cant unchecked why?
[06:44:01] <jquery396> so, the result is, fn's solution didn't work, rest are idling/busy/questioning themselves, very useful, thanks for the weak help attempts, you tried
[07:29:39] <AdamPDotty> another quiet day on the western front
[09:17:01] <goodafternoon> hi there, is it possible to do $('table.myclass').find('tr').data('mydata', 'my new value'); ?
[09:17:12] <goodafternoon> it seems not to work
[09:46:17] <Cork> goodafternoon: that should work just fine ya
[09:46:33] <Cork> or $('table.myclass tr').data('mydata', 'my new value') would do the same
[10:54:33] <nisseni> Is there a way to prevent a class from being added to the body tag? I have a plugin that's adding "left-menu-open" and I can't really find where it's added. So it would be awesome if it could be prevented.
[10:54:58] <Cork> nisseni: no you can't really do that
[10:55:10] <Cork> you could override the styling in the css though
[10:56:28] <nisseni> I've done if($('body').hasClass('left-menu-open') { $('body').removeClass('left-menu-open'); }  - but that just makes it slide in.
[10:56:51] <nisseni> Cork: not sure how to achieve that. The menu should still be possible to toggle.
[10:57:33] <Cork> nisseni: also it will only trigger when you check for it
[10:57:46] <Cork> nisseni: you most likely have a transition in your css
[10:57:48] <nisseni> Yeah
[10:58:24] <Cork> you could do something like .css('transition', 'none').removeClass('left-menu-open').css('transition', '')
[10:58:27] <Cork> that MIGHT work
[10:59:21] <nisseni> Cork: forgot to mention that the class is added with jquery somewhere in the loading of the page.
[10:59:46] <Cork> nisseni: you could just search through the source for 'left-menu-open'
[10:59:51] <Cork> shouldn't give too many hits
[11:00:06] <nisseni> Cork: did that, no results - can't really understand what's happening.
[11:00:21] <nisseni> Cork: I hoped to catch it earlier, like in the session, but I can't get the session variables.
[11:00:28] <Cork> could be it concuts an array or multiple strings
[11:00:42] <Cork> shouldn't be too hard to find
[11:00:52] <Cork> heck look for "'left"
[11:09:53] <Rob235> hey
[11:11:08] <Rob235> I've been using jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js with bootstrap but I want to use animate() now.  should I just switch to the full jquery? is there a better library I can import?
[11:11:43] <taplar> what kind of animations do you want to do?
[11:11:53] <taplar> lots of animations can be done with just css
[11:12:50] <taplar> otherwise https://github.com/jquery/jquery should talk about how to build your own slim version if you care to
[11:12:59] <taplar> 'effect' includes the animate method
[11:13:11] <taplar> or 'effects', sorry
[11:13:19] <Rob235> I guess I just want some opacity and translation animations
[11:13:35] <taplar> i'd go pure css, imho
[11:13:43] <Rob235> ok i'll look that up thanks
[12:27:28] <Es0teric> what is a regex function that returns true on a match in jquerty
[12:27:32] <Es0teric> *jquery
[12:32:01] <VeryBewitching> Specifically 'true' ?
[12:32:44] <VeryBewitching> var has_match = (new RegExp('<regex>')).test(value);
[12:34:39] <Es0teric> VeryBewitching i need to test against this var reg = new RegExp('\Log in\ig');
[12:34:49] <Es0teric> but it returns false eventhough the text exists
[12:35:20] <taplar> what exactly are you doing?
[12:35:31] <Es0teric> taplar i want to test against a string "Log in"
[12:35:42] <Es0teric> if it exists then do x if not do y
[12:35:46] <taplar> plz share the logic you currently have
[12:36:23] <Es0teric> taplar [12:34 PM] •  « Es0teric »	VeryBewitching i need to test against this var reg = new RegExp('\Log in\ig');
[12:36:32] <taplar> there is no jquery there
[12:36:42] <Es0teric> exactly
[12:36:46] <Es0teric> how do i do it in jquery?
[12:36:49] <taplar> you don't
[12:36:59] <taplar> you select the element, and operate off of it
[12:37:20] <taplar> for instance regex.test($(selector).html())
[12:37:50] <Es0teric> this shit is driving me insane
[12:38:19] <Es0teric> taplar i tried this  $('.IdPSelectTextDiv').text().match('\Log in\ig'); and it returns null
[12:39:07] <taplar> i believe that is invalid regex
[12:39:18] <taplar> match(/Log in/ig)
[12:39:38] <Es0teric> still null
[12:40:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/v6jw5okm/
[12:41:04] <taplar> if it returns null, according to the docs that is a not found
[12:42:50] <Es0teric> i literally
[12:42:57] <Es0teric> just did a regex test on one of those sites
[12:43:01] <Es0teric> and its returning a result
[12:43:27] <taplar> console.log($('.IdPSelectTextDiv').text());  verify it's value is what you expect it is
[12:43:55] <Es0teric> it returns two things
[12:43:58] <Es0teric> undefined and the string
[12:44:06] <taplar> an array?
[12:44:18] <Es0teric> console.log($('.IdPSelectTextDiv').text());
[12:44:18] <Es0teric> VM9046:1 Missing message for idpPreferred.labelLog in with GoogleEnter your university's nameMissing message for idpList.label
[12:44:20] <Es0teric> undefined
[12:44:20] <Es0teric> thats what returns
[12:44:41] <taplar> a single string of that?
[12:44:50] <Es0teric> yes
[12:44:57] <taplar> i don't see Log in in that string
[12:44:59] <Es0teric> but it also returns undefined
[12:45:03] <taplar> oooh, i see it
[12:45:07] <Es0teric> yeah
[12:46:18] <Es0teric> so why is it returning the string and undefined is my question
[12:46:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/v6jw5okm/1/
[12:46:28] <taplar> so it is an array?
[12:46:45] <taplar> 'string and undefined' isn't 'a string', like i asked
[12:47:01] <Es0teric> dude
[12:47:03] <Es0teric> literally
[12:47:07] <Es0teric> its not an array
[12:47:11] <Es0teric> i just pasted whats returned
[12:47:25] <taplar> then it's not returning the string and undefined
[12:47:28] <taplar> it's returning a string
[12:47:35] <taplar> which has undefined in it
[12:48:02] <Es0teric> taplar https://puu.sh/xKg7e/273cecf15a.png
[12:48:18] <Es0teric> thats whats returned... literally
[12:48:18] <Es0teric> so how do i get past that
[12:48:53] <Uhkis> 1) paste html + js on jsfiddle.net
[12:49:40] <Es0teric> Uhkis not possible.. its dynamically generated
[12:49:53] <taplar> you can grab the generated source
[12:50:30] <Es0teric> i have zero patience today
[12:50:34] <Es0teric> and this shit is annoying tf out of me
[12:50:41] <taplar> what does console.log($('.IdPSelectTextDiv').length); give you?
[12:51:02] <taplar> and you'll have to have patience with us cause we can't debug what we can't see
[12:53:13] <taplar> the console is saying undefined because console.log() doesn't return a value
[12:53:41] <taplar> so it's logging the string as part of it's method, but it doesn't return anything so the result of it is undefined
[12:54:10] <taplar> if you pop open the console and just do console.log('wee') it does the same thing
[12:59:49] <grapheti> You always do console.log('💩');
[13:00:07] <taplar> i don't have time for that carap
[13:00:12] <taplar> *crap
[13:00:13] <grapheti> LMAO
[13:02:01] <grapheti> They don't have anything better to do than just post shit.
[13:02:13] <taplar> 'they'?
[13:02:28] <grapheti> the others from linux

[13:04:45] <taplar> you a linux answer'er?
[13:05:06] <grapheti> lol, nah
[13:05:58] <grapheti> just tried to continue the chain of jokes and failed :D
[13:06:06] <catbadger> hiyo
[13:06:13] <catbadger> any jqgrid ninjas in here today?
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> catbadger just ask your question. if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:07:11] <catbadger> :)
[13:07:21] <robertmaxrees> you'd be surprised how often we're about to answer questions even if we don't use the library
[13:07:45] <catbadger> so I have a jqgrid. it's sorting my data. I didn't tell it to sort my data.
[13:07:50] <catbadger> wondering why
[13:08:29] <grapheti> sounds like a default option that needs to be turned off
[13:08:47] * taplar can't find proper documentation on the plugin
[13:08:52] <taplar> just some wiki site
[13:09:10] <catbadger> I know. and i can turn it off by setting a flag, but the boss wants to know why other jqgrids in the system do not need the flag.
[13:09:12] <catbadger> :/
[13:11:52] <taplar> are you doing an orderBy any where?
[13:13:34] <grapheti> or "sortname":"OrderID" ?
[13:15:15] <grapheti> I have to say. That plugin has probably the worst documentation I've ever seen.
[13:15:31] <taplar> 'what' documentation?
[13:15:54] <taplar> all i found was a wiki with change logs
[13:17:14] <catbadger> I am not
[13:17:29] <catbadger> I am fixing the problem in this grid by adding sortname: null
[13:17:42] <catbadger> but i don't need to do that elsewhere.
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> are these other widgets on the same page or on different pages?
[13:18:26] <grapheti> taplar, yeah, there's none. The only things I can see for options is to go into an example lol
[13:18:57] <catbadger> different backbone views, technically it's all one page.
[13:19:10] <taplar> are you initializing them all the same?
[13:19:34] <robertmaxrees> ^ and is anybody messing with the plugin directly?
[13:20:13] <catbadger> no one has changed the plugin in over a year.
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't mean the files.
[13:20:43] <catbadger> sorry then i need you to clarify please.
[13:20:48] <robertmaxrees> like... maybe somebody is doing something clever like $.fn.theWidgetName.someProp = 'foo'; or something.
[13:21:01] <catbadger> oh no
[13:21:37] <catbadger> the old dev made some small modifications to jqgrid, but nothing to do with sorting. Our API does the sorting and we jut need to display it more or less verbatim
[13:21:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:22:03] <taplar> best i can suggest is to see if there are differences in how you are initalizing them.  some of the options in the source seem to use orderBy if you use them.  if there are initialization differences, i'd start commenting them out one by one and see when the sorting stops
[13:28:55] <grapheti> not sure if this will help but here ya go - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8126712/jqgrid-disable-sorting
[13:29:14] * grapheti shoots in the dark
[13:29:39] <taplar> i think he said he knew how to disable.  just wanted to know why it was different
[13:29:46] <grapheti> ah
[13:31:01] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/ivFma7E.gif
[13:31:21] <taplar> heh
[13:31:24] <catbadger> thank you guys

[13:38:58] <Guest50709> Hello, How can I get rid of this scrolling effect? Its causing me a lot of problems (https://ley257caba.com)
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> fix that error.
[13:42:23] <Guest50709> robertmaxrees,  that error is not related to the scroll (i will fix it too though)
[13:45:42] <Lorena_> Hello, I need to get rid of this scrolling effect, how can I do it? https://www.ley257caba.com/
[13:46:49] <robertmaxrees> Guest50709 errors will cause other issues fwiw.
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> Guest50709 check out function scrollbar(){ in main.js
[13:47:42] <robertmaxrees> that might be your issue.
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> or Lorena_ hahahaha either/or
[13:48:11] <grapheti> lmao
[13:48:21] <taplar> twins
[13:48:28] <taplar> evil twins
[13:48:38] <grapheti> nah conjoined
[13:48:40] <robertmaxrees> different IPs, too hahahaha
[13:48:55] <taplar> twins with proxies
[13:49:05] <robertmaxrees> twinsies with proxies
[13:49:15] <Lorena_> working toghether
[13:49:21] <grapheti> awww
[13:49:26] <robertmaxrees> figured ;)
[13:49:36] <taplar> wonder ........ twins
[13:52:07] <Lorena_> here's my code, what could be the issue? function scrollbar(){          $('body').mCustomScrollbar({                         axis            :"y",              callbacks:{                 whileScrolling:function(){                     var pos=this.mcs.top;                     if(pos<=-200){                         $('.to-scroll').addClass('hide-scroll');                     }else{                         $('.to-scroll').removeClass
[13:52:43] <robertmaxrees> hey sooo
[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> don't paste code in the channel :)]
[13:52:55] <robertmaxrees> garbled unreadable mess.
[13:53:26] <Lorena_> sorry, I didn't know, I'm new at this chat
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> and try deleting that whole thing.
[13:54:17] <Lorena_> ok
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> also make sure that other error gets fixed.
[13:54:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it could cause other issues.
[13:57:28] <Al_nz1> Hiya all - can someone please take a look at this fiddle - its not working as I havent written all the code, but is designed to show my approach to the problem https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/w4avu3er/12/ - I am interested if anyone can think of a better way to do it. It relates to a scoring matrix of questions.
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do here?
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 it looks like you're doing some kind of validation or something?
[14:01:25] <Al_nz1> hi robertmaxrees
[14:01:33] <Al_nz1> trying to score the questions
[14:01:56] <Al_nz1> so depending on the answers to the top two question determines which groups of questions are "marked"
[14:02:04] <robertmaxrees> so then
[14:02:08] <Al_nz1> I keep the groups of questions in arrays
[14:02:35] <Al_nz1> but additionally and RED question automatically overrides and sends the score to "HIGH"
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> why not store those weights within data attributes or in the objects?
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> instead of writing code that tries to do that on a case by case basis?
[14:03:30] <Al_nz1> so any red question answered 1 means today score = HIGH
[14:03:57] <Al_nz1> otherwise the black questions are marked on the basis of the total score where each question = 1
[14:05:08] * robertmaxrees looks up at the question i asked.
[14:05:15] <taplar> heh
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm just gonna start ignoring people when they ignore my questions heh.
[14:06:44] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: the weights are stored in the question, when they select the dropdown the value = 0 or 1
[14:06:59] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/G6l4YV1.jpg
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> right so the issue here is you're then writing code that doesn't just use that info.
[14:07:24] <robertmaxrees> it's very clearly tied to that data.,
[14:07:31] <robertmaxrees> gotta decouple that a bit instead.
[14:07:47] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I am writing code to use that data
[14:07:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:08:08] <Al_nz1> if ($('.childpresent').val()==1 && ('.adultpresent').val==0) like this?
[14:08:17] <robertmaxrees> right, but your code is tied to that data in a way that causes you to have to create a new function for every specific case.
[14:08:30] <Al_nz1> exactly - and that is the question - is there a better way
[14:08:40] <grapheti> he just told you lol
[14:08:42] <Al_nz1> all the functions are giving me a headache
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> i just told you the better way >.>
[14:08:56] <grapheti> robertmaxrees  why not store those weights within data attributes or in the objects? 1:02:58 PM robertmaxrees  instead of writing code that tries to do that on a case by case basis?
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> it's super hard to help any further because you example handler doesn't really explain what's different between each onbe.
[14:09:43] <Al_nz1> all he said was store the weights in the data attributes. but the weights (1 or 0) are in the value=
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> and your psuedocode is hard to understand.
[14:10:08] <Guest50709> robertmaxrees, lol. I just introduced her to irc chatrooms. We are in two different countries, no proxies, dont worry.
[14:10:19] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: how do you think I feel lol
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> Guest50709 i figured it was two separate people ;)
[14:10:43] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 SO really what you need to do is write a true test case.
[14:11:13] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I have a working way - its just super ugly
[14:11:25] <robertmaxrees> so make a reduced test case out of that and show us?
[14:11:58] <taplar> if your weight is just binary, i'd probably make that a class
[14:12:02] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: would it be sufficent to show how one of those cases is marked?
[14:12:29] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 if I'm looking for the difference between multiple handlers, how would 1 be sufficient?
[14:12:43] <taplar> <select class="childquestion"> .... </select> <select class="childquestion important"> ... </select>
[14:13:06] <taplar> or something
[14:13:08] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: it would show the approach I am using - other cases would be handled in a similar fashion
[14:13:18] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 again...
[14:13:32] <robertmaxrees> if I'm looking for the  differences between handlers, how would seeing one show me what the differences are?
[14:15:50] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 no need to PM dude.
[14:16:24] <robertmaxrees> if you have a private paste, I don't wanna see it.
[14:16:47] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: no need to repeat yourself
[14:17:18] <robertmaxrees> i've asked you to not PM in the past and you haven't listened to that either :)
[14:17:21] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[14:17:21] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:18:27] <Al_nz1> you PM so....different rules?
[14:18:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> as far as my logs go back, i've never initiated a pm with you.
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like help, please keep it in the channel :)
[14:22:52] <Al_nz1> you have!!!
[14:23:22] <Al_nz1> Sept 13
[14:23:29] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) you're free to PM me if you want to talk about that separately.
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:25:55] <robertmaxrees> for the record, you're right.  i did.  it was to give you some advice to get better help in the channel.  sorry.
[14:28:57] <Al_nz1> for the record i have no issue with it.
[14:29:15] <Al_nz1> just think one should be consistent ;-)
[14:30:12] <hmhrex> I'm using the tab navbar component from the Bootstrap library. Each tab has a form with a submission button at the bottom at that triggers ajax for that form. When that submission goes through it goes to the next tab. I also want this to re-submit if you leave that tab (instead of hitting the submission button), and Bootstrap has a javascript event
[14:30:12] <hmhrex>  for that (hidden.bs.tab, https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/#events). However, I'm running into a situation where when the form submits, it goes to the next tab, which then triggers the Bootstrap event. So it fires the submission twice. Obviously I don't want this to happen, so would I be able to prevent that while still being able
[14:30:12] <hmhrex> to reuse the function they both trigger?
[14:30:20] <hmhrex> Hopefully that makes sense.
[14:31:18] <hmhrex> For example, here are the triggers:
[14:31:27] <hmhrex> https://thepasteb.in/p/j2hlQzGkPN3IP
[14:32:19] <hmhrex> Sorry, those don't look as nice currently because I've been trying multiple solutions.
[14:42:21] <SideFX> I am trying to replicate this JS: window.scrollTo(0,500); in JQuery but slowed down so it doesn't just jump up immediately but scrolls up
[14:46:31] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/832860/how-to-scroll-the-window-using-jquery-scrollto-function#5042073   related SideFX
[14:56:39] <SideFX> taplar TY
[15:21:46] <Lorena_> is there a default .deltaFactor or scrollamount value that works well in different browsers and computers?
[15:22:20] <taplar> what do you mean?
[15:22:28] <Lorena_> what I need is to make the scrolling in this page go more naturally: https://www.ley257caba.com/
[15:22:42] <Lorena_> it seems to be scrolling too fast
[15:23:30] <Lorena_> and when I change the deltaFactor value, it goes well in my computer but in others it doesn't
[15:24:38] <taplar> where's the script that does that transition?
[15:25:06] <Lorena_> is called: jquery.mCustomScrollbar.js
[15:27:12] <taplar> if it's too fast, you'll need to find the css or js that is determining that scroll speed and reduce it
[15:29:07] <Lorena_> I did it, but when I change it , it behaves differently in every computer
[15:30:43] <taplar> the speed is most likely going to be dependent upon the browser vertical space
[15:31:01] <taplar> which isn't really a constant
[15:35:53] <Lorena_> that's right, but is there a way to make it "more standard"? I mean, that behaves more naturally
[15:36:10] <taplar> i dunno what naturally means
[15:36:55] <Lorena_> hmmm, more normal, like if I'm scrolling in, for example, google
[15:37:11] <taplar> so, slower?
[15:37:14] <Lorena_> yes
[15:37:36] <taplar> increase the time allotted for the transition
[15:38:18] <Lorena_> ok, I'll try that
[16:08:37] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[16:48:42] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:50:36] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[20:25:35] <Al_nz1> how do you dynamically generate an array of visible select pickers https://jsfiddle.net/w4avu3er/53/
