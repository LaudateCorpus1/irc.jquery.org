[04:42:34] <lissitzki> hi
[04:43:22] <lissitzki> i don't know why but this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/  do not change color on click when on site
[04:43:27] <lissitzki> on fiddle is working well
[04:44:03] <lissitzki> i tried also with a minimum css
[05:06:12] <nobbieHELPpls> Hello, I need to get link inside div, I can't work it out.... Someone has an idea?
[05:06:38] <Sangeet> I need some mini project suggestions.I made addressbook recently as i started programming after tha gap of 2 years(i will use PHP,JS,JQUERY)
[07:46:53] <lissitzki> hi
[07:47:13] <Woet> hi
[07:47:26] <lissitzki> if i change a color with .css() method, is it possible to modify it with css :hover?
[07:48:17] <Woet> lissitzki: try it and see
[07:50:14] <lissitzki> it dosent'
[07:51:03] <Woet> lissitzki: you're welcome
[07:51:15] <lissitzki> so should i add another jquery method for changing color on hover?
[07:51:51] <Woet> lissitzki: so you're saying that when you use .css your existing :hover css stops working?
[07:51:59] <lissitzki> yes
[07:52:06] <Woet> lissitzki: please share your test case on https://jsfiddle.net
[07:52:13] <lissitzki> ok thanks
[07:53:54] <Robdgreat> Woet laying down sound doctrine
[07:54:48] <lissitzki> on jsfiddle i can't reproduce it.
[07:54:58] <lissitzki> it is actually working well
[07:55:53] <Woet> lissitzki: and now you know what you thought was the issue was in fact not the issue
[07:56:57] <lissitzki> here you are
[07:56:58] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/
[07:57:31] <lissitzki> the gray text should change color on hover as well
[07:57:35] <lissitzki> but they don't
[08:00:31] <Woet> lissitzki: please minimize your test case to only relevant code
[08:00:38] <Woet> lissitzki: and there's no ":hover" anywhere.
[08:01:02] <lissitzki> in css
[08:01:14] <Woet> lissitzki: there is no :hover in css.
[08:01:35] <Woet> lissitzki: theres not even any mention of color in css.
[08:02:07] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/
[08:02:14] <lissitzki> a:hover {  color: red;}
[08:02:40] <Woet> lissitzki: now there is a mention of it - all links (including the gray ones) are turning red for me.
[08:02:52] <Woet> lissitzki: https://s.woet.me/GwxdLwBgls.png
[08:03:33] <lissitzki> then you need to click DORMIR for example
[08:03:46] <lissitzki> then you'll have the gray ones
[08:03:54] <Woet> lissitzki: as I asked before, please minimize your test case to only relevant code
[08:05:12] <Woet> lissitzki: try " color: red !important;"
[08:05:35] <lissitzki> yes
[08:05:40] <lissitzki> that did the trick
[08:05:48] <lissitzki> i was minimizing  it
[08:05:59] <Woet> lissitzki: 281 lines of HTML is not minimized
[08:06:09] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/3/
[08:06:30] <lissitzki> i was minimizing it is something not done yet man
[08:06:38] <lissitzki> thanks anyway
[08:37:10] <NewDeveloper002> Hey guys I tried to make a slider but it ended up being buggy and doesn't work well. Can anyone take a look and help me figure out what's wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/aynayLya/4/
[12:22:42] <Faizan> Hi. I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask as my query is related to a plugin, Select2. I've created this codepen https://codepen.io/ftahir192/pen/paeYzV and have managed to write some jquery that when selecting an item from the dropdown menu, it shows the selected option underneath the search bar as opposed to inside it (like the default behaviour of the plugin)
[12:23:09] <Faizan> However, when pressing the "X" button to remove the tag, nothing happens. I can remove it by deselecting it from the dropdown menu, however.
[15:06:12] <devi8> btw this is the better channel to discuss jquery. in Javascript, they get a little put out with jquery questions...though jquery is just javascript..
[15:07:35] <devi8> Faizan, plus there are some great folks that hang out here and help a lot.
[15:16:27] <Faizan> devi8: Thanks for that. I'm not sure when this channel gets active - I asked a question both a few hours ago and last night but not sure if anybody saw it
[15:16:49] <devi8> Yeah it used to be active all the time, but now on the weekends, not so much
[15:17:25] <Faizan> I've gotten somewhere with my little script I think
[15:17:37] <Faizan> At least the code is making more sense to me now
[15:17:55] <devi8> that's quick. jquery is really great.
[15:18:13] <Faizan> It's still not registering the click for some reason, but I think the underlying code is there
[15:18:31] <devi8> it could be select2 library is handling the click events
[15:18:49] <devi8> I'm not familiar with select2, so I'm not sure how it handles selection
[15:19:01] <Faizan> I'm not sure, the "X" and even the <ul> is custom code and doesn't use any select2 classes
[15:19:30] <Faizan> https://codepen.io/ftahir192/pen/paeYzV I'm wondering if anybody has a quick minute and might know why the anchor tag's click listener is not being registered?
[15:19:56] <devi8> Faizan, the first line of code invokes the select2 library
[15:20:16] <Faizan> Ah that's true
[15:20:49] <devi8> I don't think you even have to build the ul, it should do it for you
[15:21:21] <Faizan> The problem was it builds the <ul> inside the search form, and I wanted to move it outside as it is now
[15:21:36] <Faizan> The code I took inspiration from unbinds some event handler using .off('click.select2-copy')
[15:21:42] <devi8> in fact, you are trying to handle the change event on the select object where you build the ul...that's the proble
[15:21:59] <devi8> I'll fix it and see if that's what you want. You are close..gimme just a minute
[15:22:18] <Faizan> Okay, very much appreciated
[15:44:32] <Faizan> I'm wondering if I have to unbind the event handler like the original code did, devi8
[15:57:51] <devi8> sorry, I got called away...I just looked at select2 and there are tons of options. I am sure you can find a solution there. I'll look some more--had to answer the door.
[16:06:49] <devi8> In fact, if you look at the docs, they have the option of removing items by selecting the "tags" option ..it adds x boxes to selected tags
[16:16:31] <Faizan> No worries devi8 - I've got the click registering now so I've made some progress
[16:17:07] <Faizan> The problem with the tags option is the placement of the tags
[22:35:57] <gonzaga> hi
