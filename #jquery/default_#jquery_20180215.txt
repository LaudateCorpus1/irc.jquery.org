[06:04:45] <Jetimon> Cheers guys
[06:05:58] <Jetimon> any idea how to create statefull button in jquery + bootstrap 4 with some nice spinner during Ajax call?
[06:06:44] <Cork> Jetimon: just add a class on the button before you make the call and remove it on .always()
[06:07:52] <Jetimon> Cork: is .always() called after success and failure too?  I suppose since it's called 'always' ;)
[06:08:02] <Cork> yes
[06:09:05] <Jetimon> cool, thanks :)
[07:16:34] <mrush> cat i not use .parent() on a class selector? more generally, certain api calls require certain selector types?
[07:20:39] <Cork> mrush: .parent() doesn't care what you run it on, but be warned, it only checks the direct parent
[07:20:50] <Cork> mrush: if you want to find a parent matching the selector use .closest()
[07:21:50] <Cork> mrush: meaning if you have <div><span><a></a></span></div> and run $('a').parent('div') it will give you an empty result
[08:04:18] <blusoup> I was hoping someone could guide me in the right direction. I want listen for a click on a button, which in turn will check the hash location of a page. If it is not the same as before I want to start an interval of 5 seconds. In that I want 3 if statements. 1: Has the page changed? Clear interval. 2: Were there any errors? Clear Interval. 3: Has the loop run more that 5 times clear interval.
[08:04:52] <blusoup> Could someone please gove me some advise on how I would create this? Thank you
[08:07:18] <Cork> blusoup: why do you need to check if the hash changes?
[08:07:35] <Cork> just have what changes it trigger the function if the button has been clicked
[08:11:38] <blusoup> i'm trying to fire an event when a button is clicked. But the page change is too slow and so I want to create this trigger where it can check when the has has changed and if it has then only fire the trigger. So basically. Click Button, then check if the hash changed. If it has fire trigger. Otherwise keep checking.
[08:11:47] <blusoup> I dont know if that makes sense?
[08:12:02] <Cork> blusoup: ya, but what changes the hash?
[08:12:27] <Cork> a better solution then to start a timer and keep checking, is to have the code actually doing the work tell you
[08:13:20] <blusoup> when you click the button the hash changes, but its too slow. so the trigger never fires.
[08:13:27] <blusoup> Anything you can suggest would be great
[08:13:36] <Cork> you say what happens, but not why
[08:13:54] <Cork> is the button a link with a #<something>? or what changes the hash
[08:16:06] <blusoup> You fill in a form. And then click click Next, but its an iframe. So the page does reload, but the hash changes. And the form opens a next section. Yeah its an #customer-check button
[08:16:17] <Cork> sigh
[08:16:29] <Cork> yes i've gotten that you click the button and something changes the hash
[08:16:37] <Cork> but i need an answer to _WHAT_ changes it
[08:18:52] <blusoup> sorry i'm lost
[08:19:16] <Cork> ok, you have a button and when it clicks is a form submitted, javascript triggered or what?
[08:19:38] <Cork> something changes the url, it doesn't just do it to spite you
[08:19:45] <blusoup> yeah the form is submitted
[08:20:04] <Cork> ok, so the form is something like url="#<something" ?
[08:20:37] <Cork> meaning is it the url attribute in the form changing the url or what does
[08:25:01] <blusoup> yeah #currentAddress
[08:25:53] <blusoup> i'm sorry I know this is making very little sense
[08:26:11] <blusoup> struggling to articulate exactly what I want
[08:26:52] <Cork> the problem is if what you say is true you can't handle it with javascript as it will reload the page
[08:27:03] <Cork> so javascript will be stopped
[08:28:19] <blusoup> ok
[08:28:22] <blusoup> ok
[08:31:34] <blusoup> So I wont be able to add an event listener for the forward and back buttons, then add a timer on that to see if the hash has changed?
[08:32:36] <Cork> like i said, if you have a page reload you would have to check if location.hash == '#currentAddress' on page loads
[08:32:48] <Cork> cause javascript is stopped and unloaded when a page reloads
[08:35:01] <EugenA> trying to use jquery tooltips, but they always appear with left: 0. Why it calculates wrong "left"?
[08:40:15] <Cork> EugenA: might be the parent is absolute or something like that
[08:40:26] <Cork> could you reproduce it in a jsfiddle?
[09:11:46] <loginoob> Is it better to check "if a class is present then remove it" than "Just doing removeClass"
[09:12:26] <Cork> loginoob: removeClass will already check if it exists so you don't need to check it first
[09:13:01] <loginoob> oh ok.
[09:15:07] <loginoob> Cork: Why doesn't it says that in documentation?
[09:15:17] <Cork> loginoob: doesn't really need to
[09:16:01] <loginoob> yeah, sorry. I didn't think it through.
[09:16:08] <Cork> cause the basic design goal of jquery design is that things shouldn't crash if there is nothing to do
[09:16:33] <Cork> that is why $('#does-not-exist').each() doesn't crash
[09:16:50] <Cork> (if that was for example prototype.js it would)
[09:16:51] <loginoob> ok
[09:17:39] <loginoob> thank you very much for the explanation
[09:17:45] <Cork> np
[10:14:20] <lissitzki> ehi
[10:14:44] <lissitzki> simple code here won't run in my site https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/Lk3tt5uh/16/
[10:15:19] <lissitzki> i wonder if i can put $(window).scroll() inside a $(document).ready()
[10:15:37] <lissitzki> i tried and is no working
[10:15:53] <lissitzki> so why not working on the site?
[10:16:17] <lissitzki> i mean how make it work if document ready cannot work?
[10:27:10] <taplar> lissitzki: that logic should work with or without a document ready.
[10:27:53] <lissitzki> iok, then what can cause the problem? dynamic generated element?
[10:28:30] <taplar> are you getting any console errors?
[10:29:39] <lissitzki> no
[10:30:09] <taplar> have you tried putting a console log in the scroll handler to see if it prints out?
[10:32:28] <lissitzki> i'll do
[10:57:50] <K__L> In list.js, is there a way to get a more accurate fuzzy search? Right now I am trying to search off my card's title/name, and following the plugin rules it should be set for exact match, but it doesnt seem to reflect that. (posting code in a sec)
[11:00:08] <K__L> here is my code: https://bpaste.net/show/95dc75074824
[11:03:51] <taplar> this doesn't look like a jQuery plugin
[11:05:02] <taplar> you might try ##javascript
[11:05:04] <K__L> Oops, my app around it is jquery, but you're right. I'll take it to #javascript
[11:05:07] <K__L> sorry about that!
[11:05:11] <taplar> np
[12:18:37] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/97ytgyae/ it has two elements that have the classname of wrapper_servp(line 1 and 17)
[12:19:30] <dimi1947> what I want to do is remove the element whose input,it's name attribute contains the word form...in other words the second one
[12:21:53] <grapheti> I'm looking at it like this - https://i.imgur.com/zcFfgG2.gif
[12:23:02] <grapheti> You can remove an element with this - https://api.jquery.com/remove/
[12:23:57] <dimi1947> I know the method to remove an element..the problem in my case is how to target the one I want
[12:25:22] <grapheti> dimi1947, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors
[12:26:47] <dimi1947> that is not going to help either...maybe I was not clear...I CAN remove the inputs from the DOM but the container stays...something I do not want
[12:26:58] <grapheti> or https://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[12:28:08] <grapheti> Let me know when you got some jQuery up.
[12:29:15] <dimi1947> some code you mean?
[12:29:21] <grapheti> So when you click "no" you want the price input to disappear?
[12:29:44] <dimi1947> no...
[12:30:00] <grapheti> Not sure what you want, sorry.
[12:30:16] <dimi1947> give me a second to show you another fiddle...maybe you will understand better
[12:31:48] <dimi1947> look this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/
[12:32:22] <dimi1947> click edit and then the plus sign and fill the inputs....when you are done tell me
[12:33:01] <grapheti> k
[12:33:03] <grapheti> done
[12:34:05] <dimi1947> Imagine now the following
[12:36:30] <dimi1947> Upon clicking save...the data are sent with ajax to the server...and there is a chance the server replies with error at which point I have decided that the inputs filled from the user at this last ajax request should be REMOVED from the DOM...so...I am trying to finde ways to remove them...but only these
[12:42:20] <grapheti> sigh, have a meeting, maybe someone else can help
[12:51:16] <taplar> you want to find the elements who's name starts with 'form'?
[13:13:01] <Guest7135> how come google maps keeps giving me new version
[13:13:57] <robertmaxrees> because they do updates?
[13:14:12] <Guest7135> ya but im specify version=

[13:15:28] <Guest7135> 3.30?
[13:15:38] <Guest7135> i told it to give me 3.9
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> don't you specify the version via the url you load?
[13:15:55] <Guest7135> yes
[13:16:01] <robertmaxrees> also: there is no 3.9
[13:16:09] <Guest7135> but its just a param &v
[13:16:24] <Guest7135> so its completely fake
[13:16:28] <Guest7135> just like google u know
[13:16:42] <Guest7135> hey google r u recording me?
[13:16:47] <Guest7135> nooooo, never

[13:29:36] <SpecialTech> ugh whats up with intel lately
[13:29:44] <SpecialTech> it keeps crashing my os
[13:29:57] <taplar> the cia can be like that these days
[13:30:16] <SpecialTech> it's been a pain, I can't even work properly.
[13:30:19] <phoenixdeac> When using a $.when.apply($, promiseList).then(function(results))... Assuming all promises were resolved successfully, are the results returned in an array for all the promises? Or is the function(results) called one by one for all the executed promises?
[13:30:43] <robertmaxrees> phoenixdeac one call for the .then()
[13:30:49] <robertmaxrees> when they've all resolved.
[13:31:05] <phoenixdeac> ah ok, thank you robertmaxrees. the one call is an array of the responses it seems?
[13:31:28] <taplar> wouldn't you need to use the arguments variable at that point?
[13:31:46] <taplar> i thought the then for a when was (response1, response2, response3, ...)
[13:32:34] <phoenixdeac> hmm.. which would be  an array of responses taplar? response[1, 2, 3...]?
[13:32:56] <taplar> arguments[0], arguments[1]
[13:33:06] <taplar> arguments is a keyword variable for all functions
[13:33:29] <phoenixdeac> ahh i see.. thank you.. been testing a bit, but don't think i've hit the right use case... will play w/ that a bit
[13:33:30] <taplar> similar to 'this'
[13:35:45] <taplar> you could test it by creating some dummy $.Deferred
[13:39:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p9frwc25/1/
[13:44:36] <phoenixdeac> ahh thanks a ton @taplar and @robertmaxrees
[13:44:52] <phoenixdeac> my googling wasn't as conclusive there, really appreciate that
[14:06:06] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/97ytgyae/10/ I have two elements with class wrapper_servp and one of them(the second) has inputs with a name attribute value that contains the string form in it...Hoq can I target the second one only?
[14:08:15] <taplar> i tried to ask about this earlier.  are you wanting to target the inputs that have a name starting with 'form'?
[14:08:56] <dimi1947> let me put it this way...
[14:09:41] <dimi1947> I want to remove from the DOM with class wrapper_servp that it's inputs have form in the name attribute value
[14:09:59] <taplar> so that's your selector
[14:10:10] <dimi1947> yes...
[14:10:15] <Guest7135> bad google
[14:10:31] <taplar> '.wrapper_servp' will lookup the class
[14:10:56] <dimi1947> yes...but that is not enough
[14:10:56] <taplar> '[name^="form"]' will lookup names that start with form
[14:11:19] <dimi1947> is there a way to combine these two in a selector expression?
[14:11:34] <robertmaxrees> you want the parent that contains a particular child?
[14:11:47] <dimi1947> yes....in other words
[14:13:59] <dimi1947> maybe children() can be usefull here
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd use filter with a function
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b54hgyx2/
[14:16:32] <dimi1947> I tried this and it did not work https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/97ytgyae/13/....so maybe filter is the way to go
[14:17:02] <robertmaxrees> a valid expression is helpful for this, too ;)
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> $( ".wrapper_servp" ).children( "input[name*='form']" ) means "get me all inputs whose name starts with form that are direct children of elements with class wrapper_servp
[14:17:42] <robertmaxrees> "
[14:19:00] <dimi1947> so I suppose it is wrong cause the inputs are not direct children in this case
[14:19:15] <robertmaxrees> nor do you want the inputs.
[14:19:38] <robertmaxrees> you want the parent element./
[14:20:37] <dimi1947> I want to remove the parent elements...the input serves as to WHICH element I want to remove
[14:21:04] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> so your initial approaech wouldn't work because it'd get you the child elements.
[14:22:53] <dimi1947> so..what can I try
[14:23:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ already gave you a fiddle.
[14:25:26] <dimi1947> I tried the code and it does not work...and for testing/simplicity I target only inputs...seeforyourself https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/97ytgyae/24/
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> look at the console duder.
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> you're not including jhquery on yours.
[14:28:01] <dimi1947> oh....
[14:28:14] <dimi1947> I had completely forgotten it...
[14:28:27] <dimi1947> now it is ok...the code works...thx
[15:00:11] <sunrunner20> how do I make a an anchor's text change when its clicked?
[15:00:30] <robertmaxrees> an event handler.
[15:00:38] <sunrunner20> I'm a complete noob to jquery so if there's a tutorial or documentation I need to read point me at it
[15:00:53] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ :)
[15:00:58] <sunrunner20> how do I do that? I haven't touched JS in like 18 years
[15:01:22] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/ + http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[15:02:04] <robertmaxrees> basically, select the element, use .on() to bind your handler which changes the text.
[15:06:24] <sunrunner20> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:06:44] <sunrunner20> I think the events tutorial/documentation gave me an example sufficient that I can google what I don't know
[15:07:04] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  if you need more help, feel free to ask away :)
[15:08:24] <sunrunner20> I try not to ask such basic questions but I'm in a time crunch and need this particular task completed today
[15:08:45] <sunrunner20> haven't had a chance to go through the docs
[15:18:25] <Almoullim> Hello
[15:19:00] <Almoullim> I'm trying to make a list of div's sortable but its not working for i don't know what reason
[15:19:05] <Almoullim> https://jsfiddle.net/almoullim/opzLa7Lt/10/
[15:23:06] <grapheti> Check your console first. Fix that.
[15:23:10] <grapheti> Add jQuery UI
[15:23:44] <grapheti> https://jsfiddle.net/opzLa7Lt/13/
[15:29:39] <Almoullim> Hello, I forgot to add it in jsfiddle but i have in my files but still somehow doesn't work. maybe something wrong with the other files then
[15:30:57] <Almoullim> ok, i fixed it.. Thx!
[15:31:19] <grapheti> :D
[15:36:49] <sunrunner20> robertmaxrees, I'm doing something wrong- https:/pastebin.com/xhkAz5FN
[15:37:17] <sunrunner20> its ugly right now cause I'm just trying to get it to work at all
[15:37:27] <sunrunner20> its not changing the text
[15:38:32] <sunrunner20> ok so it's not running at all
[15:39:28] <robertmaxrees> sop
[15:39:30] <robertmaxrees> *so
[15:39:40] <robertmaxrees> is your code before or after the html needed?
[15:41:08] <sunrunner20> its before
[15:41:22] <robertmaxrees> do you have a document ready?
[15:41:41] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[15:41:55] <sunrunner20> i'm guessing no because I have no idea what that is
[15:42:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> check out that link.
[15:45:39] <sunrunner20> did
[15:45:41] <sunrunner20> added it
[15:45:42] <sunrunner20> no change
[15:45:54] <robertmaxrees> mind showing your new code?
[15:47:32] <sunrunner20> https://pastebin.org/u26Buuzw
[15:48:16] <robertmaxrees> weird.  pastebin won't load for me.
[15:48:30] <sunrunner20> it is an element that already has a bootstrap collapse assigned to it, maybe bootstrap is preventing the event from propigating?
[15:48:46] <sunrunner20> does gist load robertmaxrees ?
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:50:06] <robertmaxrees> oh now the bin works.
[15:50:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/csba7vba/2/
[15:50:26] <robertmaxrees> so your code works fine.
[15:50:35] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating the link or something?
[15:51:15] <sunrunner20> no the anchor is in the original html
[15:51:34] <sunrunner20> its a collapsible section to hide the advanced search features
[15:51:45] <sunrunner20> trying to make it indicate if its open or closed
[15:52:22] <robertmaxrees> should work fine.  i'd have to see it in action.
[15:52:52] <sunrunner20> can't do that unfortunately
[15:53:00] <sunrunner20> so it seems my guess was right
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> you can't make an isolated test case?
[15:54:54] <robertmaxrees> either way - it sounds like you want to bind to the open/close
[15:54:59] <robertmaxrees> not to the click.
[16:05:33] <sunrunner20> hrm, found a stackoverflow post discussing what I want and its almost identical to what I want
[16:06:26] <sunrunner20> guess I'll deal with it when I know more
[16:07:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:07:05] <sunrunner20> the bootstrap js is greek to me right now
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> which feature are ytou using?
[16:08:07] <sunrunner20> collapse
[16:08:08] <sunrunner20> version 4
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/ ?
[16:08:40] <sunrunner20> yea
[16:08:44] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#events
[16:08:46] <robertmaxrees> see this?
[16:09:20] <sunrunner20> no
[16:09:21] <sunrunner20> missed that
[16:09:25] <sunrunner20> must be blind
[16:09:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:17:54] <sunrunner20> still doesn't work
[16:18:02] <sunrunner20> must be doing something wrong but idk what
[16:18:30] <sunrunner20> oh well, I'll get the rest of it done and have a more experienced front end dev look at it tom.
[16:19:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:19:54] <robertmaxrees> you're not repeating that ID, right?
[16:20:59] <sunrunner20> correct
[16:21:56] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[16:22:40] <sunrunner20> I figured out one issue
[16:22:51] <robertmaxrees> yes?
[16:23:01] <sunrunner20> had the event bound to the wrong element
[16:23:19] <robertmaxrees> hah, gotta make sure your handler is on the right thing :)
[16:23:21] <sunrunner20> but that didn't fix it like I hoped
[16:23:45] <sunrunner20> I'm a green skinned noob
[16:23:51] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[16:23:56] <sunrunner20> going to screw that up for sure
[16:24:02] <robertmaxrees> gotta get on that test case train :)

[16:34:45] <V7> Hey all
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> sup
[16:35:50] <V7> So, could anyone help with: var foo = $('#foo').clone( ); alert( pic.width ) gives 0
[16:36:21] <V7> So is it the right way to clone an object ?
[16:36:33] <V7> alert( foo.width ) *
[16:37:42] <Guest83193> Cork: thanks for telling me about closest
[16:38:37] <robertmaxrees> what is pic v7?
[16:38:48] <V7> robertmaxrees: it's typo
[16:38:53] <V7> foo.width *
[16:39:41] <robertmaxrees> V7 and what does cloning have to do with the element size?
[16:40:44] <V7> Btw robertmaxrees the main reason is to get an elements real size without ( which needs to remove width, height attributes, style etc. )
[16:41:09] <robertmaxrees> without what?
[16:41:15] <V7> So I thought that I would achieve this by cloning an object, removing from it styles and getting it's real size
[16:41:19] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nh3n38sn/2/
[16:41:23] <V7> robertmaxrees: without styles
[16:41:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:41:37] <V7> For example: style="width: 100px"
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> it's still in the DOM, which the CSS is applied to.
[16:41:49] <robertmaxrees> why do you want that info?
[16:42:20] <V7> I have some dom which is changed in it's styles
[16:42:32] <V7> It's size
[16:42:37] <V7> So I need to get it's real size
[16:42:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost heh
[16:42:46] <V7> ...
[16:43:02] <robertmaxrees> why do you need it's "real size"?
[16:43:08] <robertmaxrees> trying to understand the root problem.
[16:43:09] <V7> Does it matter ?
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:43:22] <robertmaxrees> since there might be an alternative approach.
[16:43:24] <V7> Ok. Let's assume it's image.
[16:43:40] <V7> For example, it has style="width: 100px"
[16:43:40] <robertmaxrees> so you want the raw height/width of an image?
[16:43:53] <V7> Let's assume, yes.
[16:44:02] <robertmaxrees> it's relevant, duder.
[16:44:23] <robertmaxrees> because there's an image-specific way to do thisl
[16:44:42] <V7> Ok, how you would do this with an image ?
[16:45:41] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1093364
[16:46:11] <V7> So here you're creating new image object from source
[16:46:25] <V7> This will download new image if browser doesn't support cache, is it ?
[16:46:46] <robertmaxrees> the vast majority of browsers will have the image cached.
[16:47:15] <robertmaxrees> if that's not good enough, have the server pump out data attributes onto the image tag with the original height/width
[16:47:17] <V7> Ok, this is a variant. btw is it possible to clone an object like I've tried ?
[16:47:32] <robertmaxrees> V7 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nh3n38sn/2/
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> that's how you clone using jquery.
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> but that's not going to circumvent the styles applied to the tag.
[16:53:43] <mrush> i cant tell why i am getting 'too much recursion' error from enumerate_branch(), i am limiting the recursion https://jsfiddle.net/m26bLrod/5/
[16:54:24] <robertmaxrees> mrush that depends on how many times it runs.
[16:58:17] <V7> robertmaxrees: btw is it normal that $(window).on('load', function() { doesn't work in jsfiddle ?
[16:58:42] <robertmaxrees> V7 not sure.
[17:00:08] <mrush> robertmaxrees: are you saying the limit logic broken
[17:00:20] <mrush> s/broken/is &/
[17:00:20] <b-ot> Correction, <mrush> robertmaxrees: are you saying the limit logic is &
[17:00:42] <robertmaxrees> mrush that would seem to be the case.
[17:00:57] <mrush> robertmaxrees: ty
[17:00:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting a few thousand iterations on it.
[17:01:15] <mrush> lol okay then i'll look into that
[17:01:48] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[17:01:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:01:52] <V7> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/atu2behL/7/
[17:01:57] <robertmaxrees> mrush this is simple :)
[17:02:04] <V7> So as you could see it's 0
[17:02:08] <robertmaxrees> let branch = []; you do that at the beginning of enumerate_branch
[17:02:08] <V7> mb
[17:02:28] <mrush> robertmaxrees: d'oh
[17:02:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:02:52] <mrush> thanks man (:
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> V7 that image doesn't have any of those attributesd.
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> and images are inline elements by default.
[17:04:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/atu2behL/9/
[17:10:56] <V7> It's inline
[17:11:09] <V7> now
[17:11:12] <V7> was *
[17:11:15] <V7> Btw yup
[17:11:23] <V7> I've made a mistake there
[17:29:57] <V7> ;Thank you very much robertmaxrees
[17:35:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:14:08] <V7> Is it possible to convert js's context's data's alpha channel to default php's imagepng alpha cannel value ?
[18:18:30] <V7> For example, 125 alpha value in php will give 4 in context's data, but ( ( 255 - color[ 3 ] ) / 2 ) will give 125.5
[18:18:36] <V7> So is there any right solution to convert context's alpha value to php's image png alpha value ?
[19:17:02] <Sveta> https://jsfiddle.net/Lzycmna8/6/ why'd the data-page-title attribute not get added?
[19:56:01] <ngharo> Sveta: take a look at your console
[20:04:43] <Sveta> Ta.
[20:34:34] <V7> Hey all
