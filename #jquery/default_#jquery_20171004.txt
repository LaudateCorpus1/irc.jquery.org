[08:20:24] <Nece228> hello, anyone can tell why line 32 doesnt work as intended?

[08:28:44] <Cork> Nece228: https://jsfiddle.net/e3n7w4jk/6/
[08:28:48] <Cork> check the console log
[08:28:55] <Cork> stuff_se returns undefined
[08:29:50] <Cork> most likely cause the two objects doesn't overlap with there keys
[08:30:23] <Cork> 05-04, 05-19 for one and 05-10, 05-15 for the other
[08:35:26] <Nece228> Cork: yeah, i see, then i need to create a seperate key for stuff_se
[08:36:24] <Cork> Nece228: ya
[08:37:41] <Cork> might be simplest to just take Object.keys(stuff).concat(Object.keys(stuff_se)).sort()
[08:37:51] <Cork> and then just loop that array and build from taht

[10:02:41] <DrMedRasen> hey guys
[10:02:53] <DrMedRasen> lets say i have several divs of class item
[10:03:04] <DrMedRasen> how can i select the eg. third occurence of it

[10:20:07] <grapheti> interesting he
[10:20:08] <grapheti> heh*
[11:14:45] <taplar> that's pretty smart
[11:17:12] <taplar> though if your custom font is very different from the default, the swap of the style might look weird
[12:42:23] <marcisb> https://pastebin.com/Y3w8ng6Y - Why my alert(1); Not working into the callback function in $.post(); ?
[12:43:58] <taplar> what response code is that request getting?
[12:44:20] <taplar> and check your console for errors
[12:46:30] <marcisb> Its send post
[12:47:03] <marcisb> Where i can see response code into chrome?
[12:47:10] <marcisb> Developer tools network?
[12:47:14] <taplar> yes
[12:49:07] <sky> I'm using .ajax.. with complete: ... doesnt work correctly because the DOM is not updated before complete is fired
[12:49:23] <sky> whats my mistake? trying to update content based on the new ajax dom modifications
[12:49:34] <taplar> sky: show us what you're trying
[12:49:46] <marcisb> taplar i get status code 200
[12:49:46] <sky> the ajax modifys some content in the page
[12:50:00] <sky> the content is yet to show up by the time compelte fires
[12:50:11] <taplar> marcisb: what is the response content returned?
[12:50:24] <taplar> sky: please make a fiddle or pastie with the logic you are performing
[12:50:35] <sky> thats it!
[12:50:40] <marcisb> taplar, {"text":"v ttvvt","id":"123"} Its from input
[12:51:03] <taplar> 'from input'?
[12:51:09] <sky> .ajax( with success: loading a change to the dom (appending html), then on complete I fire a function to modify the new bits of html)
[12:51:10] <marcisb> Yes
[12:51:29] <taplar> i'm not sure what that means.  i'm asking what is the response from the ajax request in the network tab
[12:52:01] <marcisb> taplar, Response looks like this {"text":"v ttvvt","id":"123"}
[12:52:16] <taplar> ok, so that's valid json so that's not the issue
[12:52:34] <taplar> does the parent get removed?
[12:53:43] <marcisb> No it also not working
[12:53:46] <marcisb> : (
[12:54:03] <marcisb> In tutorial video it removed parent element which clicked
[12:54:13] <marcisb> Bet here it isnt working i cant figure out why
[12:55:09] <taplar> try changing the call to this and see what logs
[12:55:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uvh79jpd/
[12:55:36] <marcisb> ok
[12:58:05] <marcisb> taplar https://pastebin.com/ELR4Vr63 I got this error
[12:58:38] <taplar> use on instead of bind
[12:58:50] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:58:59] <taplar> take note of the input order
[13:00:01] <taplar> actually bind and on may have the same order, so maybe ignore that
[13:00:58] <taplar> though, why are you calling bind off of the post()?
[13:05:47] <dimi1947> is it possible that the serialize method can work on whatever form there is on a page regardless of the element that is chosen as a selector
[13:06:02] <dimi1947> ??
[13:06:11] <taplar> it'll operate on what was found with $()
[13:09:24] <dimi1947> in theory yes....I agree...the weird in my case is that it has effect also on another form of the page it's NOT being inside $()
[13:09:26] <guideX> how to get a select option by data-id? console.log($('#lstClaimantCompanyState option[data-codeid="' + codeid + '"]').length);
[13:09:31] <guideX> that ^ is not working
[13:09:38] <sky> so is there any way I can wait for the dom to be updated after my append?
[13:09:52] <taplar> the dom will be updated after the append
[13:09:53] <sky> so I can fire a function to operate on the appended content
[13:10:22] <taplar> guideX: i'd suggest using find() and giving it a function to match on the data-id
[13:10:31] <taplar> or filter()
[13:11:11] <taplar> $('#lstClaimantCompanyState').find('option').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('id') === 'whatever'; })
[13:11:23] <guideX> thanks taplar
[13:11:59] <taplar> dimi1947: can you show an example of the behavior that you are seeing?
[13:12:09] <marcisb> How to clear cache in chrome developer tools
[13:12:10] <marcisb> ?
[13:12:26] <marcisb> Is it important to clear cahce because old js file is there but i have new
[13:12:29] <marcisb> ?
[13:12:31] <taplar> you can go into the options (cog) and there is an option to turn off cache while the console is open
[13:12:38] <taplar> otherwise, i think there is a checkbox toggle some where
[13:12:44] <marcisb> WHy it happens i edited js file but in browser i see old file
[13:12:46] <marcisb> ?
[13:13:13] <taplar> ya, network tab has a disable cache checkbox
[13:13:17] <marcisb> ok
[13:17:48] <sky> so, cant wait for dom update after append event?
[13:17:58] <taplar> you don't have to, it will be updated after the append
[13:18:37] <dimi1947> taplar:I will have it ready tommorrow,the HTML is messed up and I cannot get a working example in a few minutes
[13:18:42] <sky> got it twisted. I want to call a function that can only succeed after the dom has updated
[13:18:56] <sky> I cant do this right after .append, doesnt work... dom not updated
[13:19:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uk4p6p8u/
[13:19:56] <taplar> which is why i asked you to share the logic you are doing
[13:20:11] <taplar> and you only gave me descriptions about what you were doing
[13:20:11] <sky> I have...
[13:20:12] <marcisb> taplar i converted ir in $.ajax() and it works but i cant understand why
[13:20:18] <taplar> i can't debug descriptions of code
[13:20:33] <sky> ah, maybe cause im inside document ready?
[13:20:39] <marcisb> In $.post() not working but in $.ajax() it works fine
[13:21:10] <taplar> marcisb: share the working version?
[13:21:47] <marcisb> https://pastebin.com/ejHspfCb
[13:21:50] <marcisb> This works fine
[13:22:05] <sky> $(document).ready(function() {.ajax({success:append(); myfuncfails();})});
[13:22:23] <taplar> marcisb: that ajax call isn't doing the 'json' thing the $.post was doing
[13:22:27] <taplar> so there is a difference there
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> sky that's not valid/.
[13:22:50] <taplar> sky: again, please share what you're actually doing
[13:22:55] <taplar> not descriptions
[13:22:55] <sky> sigh
[13:23:07] <robertmaxrees> sky the code example you just provided is totally invalid fwiw.
[13:23:09] <sky> ooooooooooook
[13:23:17] <sky> I will write a sample.
[13:23:23] <taplar> i mean, if you don't want us to help you, you don't have to
[13:23:45] <taplar> but we're not psychic
[13:26:13] <sky> https://pastebin.com/PhHS2Fzy
[13:26:59] <robertmaxrees> sky .before and its ilk are all synchronous.
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> are you maybe repeating that ID?
[13:27:11] <guideX> taplar: thanks again, I made some modifications, I couldn't get something in the original working, perhaps the data or filter parts? not sure... https://pastebin.com/raw/5zdfpzmu
[13:27:31] <guideX> but the loop is working great, not sure if there's anything wrong with that, maybe it's slower
[13:27:42] <sky> the html gets inserted successfully..
[13:27:45] <taplar> what's the value of codeid?
[13:27:59] <robertmaxrees> sky so what is that function supposed to do?
[13:28:04] <taplar> for shiggles try changing '===' to '=='
[13:28:14] <taplar> data() will do type coersion
[13:28:18] <sky> in fact, if I insert <script>myFunc();<\/script> in the end of the before'd html it also fails
[13:28:21] <guideX> well basically, the lstClaimantCompanyState has a list of states, and the "state" variable has that state etc
[13:28:24] <sky> the function operates on the before'd html
[13:28:35] <guideX> hm ok cool
[13:28:59] <sky> if i just use alert() instead of myfunc, it shows the alert before the dom is updated as well
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> sky any console errors?
[13:29:07] <sky> nipoe
[13:29:16] <robertmaxrees> something seems awfully amiss here then./
[13:29:21] <sky> jquery 1.9
[13:29:30] <taplar> if you mean dom not updated by it not showing on the screen that is entirely plausable
[13:29:31] <sky> maybe i needa update
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[13:29:38] <taplar> the alert() will fire before the redraw
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:29:47] <taplar> but the dom will still have been changed
[13:31:51] <sky> my functiob does something like $('#myhtmlelement').getValue()
[13:31:55] <robertmaxrees> "
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> "getValue"?
[13:32:18] <taplar> why are you being vague on what it does?
[13:32:23] <sky> .datepicker('getDate').getUTCDay()
[13:32:31] <sky> i dont see the relevance, shrug
[13:32:39] <sky> just tryng to keep it simple
[13:32:45] <robertmaxrees> sky so something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x1kd0g2w/1/ ?
[13:32:52] <robertmaxrees> because if so, I can tell you what your issue probably is.
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> but since i don't know what that function is actually doing, it's hard to say.
[13:33:26] <robertmaxrees> my guess is that you're likely selecting the wrong element.
[13:33:30] <grapheti> > myFuncThatFailsToOperateOnAppendedContentCauseDOmNotUpdated()
[13:33:33] <grapheti> lool'd
[13:33:52] <sky> the selection/function works fine when I put it on a change event or something
[13:34:00] <robertmaxrees> can you show us some more detail?
[13:34:12] <taplar> q -> p issues are 'fun'
[13:34:34] <robertmaxrees> sky because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x1kd0g2w/2/
[13:35:10] <robertmaxrees> so something here doesn't add up.
[13:35:40] <taplar> i started to suggest the [id=""] length console check
[13:36:21] <robertmaxrees> ^ i might do this.  but without knowing the contents of the various functions and the markup in play, it's suuuuper difficult to really suggest anything.
[13:36:29] <SideFX> I have url: "/results/faxinvoice/",  in an AJAX call but the site I'm on is secure but the call is trying to do http, and getting blocked by the browser
[13:36:42] <sky> the function gets a value from an element that is not touched during the ajax call. the function is a switch that looks at existing value, then hides elements that were added form the ajax call
[13:36:43] <taplar> can you hit is with https?
[13:37:01] <taplar> sky: we -cannot- debug descriptions
[13:37:11] <sky> i will rewrite more.
[13:37:20] <sky> love this stuff
[13:37:22] <SideFX> Yeah it should be able to be called with https
[13:37:30] <robertmaxrees> sky try this: put console.log('foo'
[13:37:35] <taplar> SideFX: i'd suggest taking the protocal off
[13:37:49] <robertmaxrees> *console.log('foo') at the top of that special function. verify it's getting hit in the first place.
[13:38:00] <SideFX> taplar I'm not sure what take the protocal off means?
[13:38:02] <robertmaxrees> if it is, then the issue is likele with that function, not the ajax call/dom manipulation.
[13:38:34] <taplar> SideFX: say the url is "http://me.com", you can do just url: "//me.com" and it will use whatever protocal the page was loaded with
[13:39:11] <SideFX> Interesting, let me give that a try
[13:49:57] <sky> argh, jsfiddle is even roughing me up
[13:50:13] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you've got?
[13:52:44] <sky> https://jsfiddle.net/ta7q5wff/
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:53:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ta7q5wff/1/
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/b241Uzj.png
[13:53:54] <robertmaxrees> so that's how you add jquery + jquery ui.
[13:54:06] <robertmaxrees> and that myFunc matches what's in your codebase?
[13:54:10] <robertmaxrees> if so, I'm getting an error.
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> sky what datepicker are you using?
[13:56:17] <sky> not reallylet me fix that
[13:56:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ta7q5wff/2/
[14:01:46] <sbs> hi
[14:01:54] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[14:02:03] <sbs> can anyone help with a bootstrap timepicker issue ?
[14:02:19] <sbs> I can't seem to get it working in a modal dialog.
[14:02:24] <sbs> is there a trick of some sorts ?
[14:02:50] <robertmaxrees> sbs i might try ##bootstrap
[14:03:05] <sbs> trying atm
[14:12:24] <sky> https://jsfiddle.net/ta7q5wff/9/
[14:12:28] <sky> ah well
[14:12:38] <sky> now that I wrote all new sample code it works
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> sky but still broken on your site?
[14:21:10] <robertmaxrees> try https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ta7q5wff/10/
[14:22:26] <sky> i figured it out
[14:22:29] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[14:22:37] <sky> my datepicker object was not inited in time
[14:22:48] <sky> doh
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:22:58] <robertmaxrees> gotta init it first :)
[14:25:57] <sky> yea. i get got sometimes
[14:25:59] * sky shakes fist
[14:28:44] <sky> is there a way to coordinate setDate and beforeShowDay? specifically, if I want to block tuesday and thursday from being selected by setdate: 1
[14:30:10] <robertmaxrees> so you want to make certain dates non-selectable?
[14:30:20] <sky> that part I have done with beforeshowdate.
[14:30:30] <sky> but, if I put setDate:1, then that date gets selected anyway
[14:31:02] <robertmaxrees> ah.  you'd need to make that apart of the logic that calls setDate
[14:32:08] <sky> robertmaxrees: ideas on how?
[14:32:29] <sky> seems like this is gonna get convoluted ..
[14:32:31] <robertmaxrees> well - what's calling setDate?
[14:32:36] <sky> the datepicker init
[14:32:53] <sky> so I need to figure out what to pass to setdate by comparing what it moght be?
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> seems odd that your init would block certain days from being selectable but not then not know if setDate is valid.
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> why call setDate at all?
[14:33:52] <sky> well, its a default
[14:34:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd setup your backend to output the object you use to init and have that handle that default date then.
[15:20:36] <lindenhurst> trying to get this to click through to the next step, any ideas? - https://jsfiddle.net/r65n75n1/
[15:32:15] <marcisb>  parsererror, error thrown: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input   WHat is this error?
[15:36:58] <taplar> lindenhurst: where's your click handler?
[15:37:14] <taplar> marcisb: that's suggesting invalid json format
[15:38:04] <marcisb> {id: 'id'} Is this invalid?
[15:38:24] <taplar> no
[15:38:32] <taplar> {"id":"id"}
[15:38:35] <marcisb> I have this in post in data
[15:38:55] <marcisb> id is variable from attribute rel
[15:38:57] <lindenhurst> marcisb, I think you use double quotes for valid json
[15:39:03] <taplar> ^
[15:39:07] <lindenhurst> https://jsonlint.com/
[15:39:08] <taplar> and you quote keys
[15:39:37] <marcisb> For example i have var id which gets rel atribute which is number
[15:39:42] <lindenhurst> taplar: I wasn't sure where to put it in the scope
[15:39:47] <marcisb> {id : ¨id¨}
[15:39:58] <taplar> marcisb: you're not listening dude
[15:40:18] <marcisb> double quotes where?
[15:40:23] <taplar> every where
[15:40:27] <taplar> keys and string values
[15:40:42] <lindenhurst> these are double quotes "
[15:40:42] <marcisb> Yes but key is from var
[15:40:48] <lindenhurst> you put double quotes around the key/values
[15:40:53] <lindenhurst> "id": "id"
[15:40:54] <lindenhurst> like that
[15:40:58] <taplar> what are you talking about?
[15:41:04] <taplar> are you building json from objects?
[15:41:09] <marcisb>  var id = $(this).attr('rel');
[15:41:19] <marcisb> i need id there
[15:41:26] <taplar> are you building json from objects?
[15:41:27] <marcisb> {id : ¨id¨}
[15:41:42] <marcisb> I will show code
[15:41:56] <taplar> you don't build json manually
[15:42:05] <taplar> you make your objects and then send them to JSON.stringify()
[15:43:16] <taplar> lindenhurst: you can put it any where really.  but in the doc ready would be fine
[15:43:42] <lindenhurst> taplar: alright, I'll work on that
[15:43:42] <lindenhurst> ty
[15:44:17] <taplar> actually it has to be in the doc ready cause the 'i' is scoped to that closure
[15:47:59] <lindenhurst> getting closer - https://jsfiddle.net/r65n75n1/1/
[15:48:34] <taplar> you can't scope the i down to the click method.  you'll lose it's value
[15:48:48] <taplar> it would need to be scoped to the doc ready, or scoped to something else
[15:50:04] <lindenhurst> I see - https://jsfiddle.net/r65n75n1/4/
[15:50:09] <lindenhurst> ty taplar
[16:12:53] <lindenhurst> I'm getting TypeError: this.tabledata is undefined - https://jsfiddle.net/r65n75n1/5/
[16:13:15] <lindenhurst> I don't see a fix in the code
[16:14:24] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:16:00] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy
[16:16:06] <robertmaxrees> not all of them have tabledata
[16:16:47] <lindenhurst> ohhh
[16:16:54] <lindenhurst> which ones? I'm blind lol
[16:17:24] <lindenhurst> ah, you mean in the json
[16:17:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:17:52] <lindenhurst> ty robertmaxrees
[16:18:23] <robertmaxrees> easy way to check that next time is a simple console.log(this); as the first thing in the callback.
[16:19:37] <lindenhurst> nice ty
[16:20:31] <lindenhurst> so it's all but the last one
[16:21:30] <lindenhurst> do I have to add tabledata to the last one? is that the only fix?
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> well
[16:25:12] <robertmaxrees> there are a few opinions around that.
[16:25:55] <robertmaxrees> lindenhurst are the valid cases where tabledata wouldn't contain anything?
[16:25:59] <robertmaxrees> *there
[16:28:01] <lindenhurst> yes, there is
[16:28:12] <lindenhurst> it's kind of like a slide with steps
[16:28:21] <lindenhurst> and the end of the slide, no steps need to be made
[16:29:43] <lindenhurst> I mean, I could make it an empty object if I have to
[16:35:07] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> was away for a sec.
[16:35:26] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, if "empty" is a valid state, then made the tableData object and have it be empty./
[16:39:17] <lindenhurst> np
[16:41:02] <robertmaxrees> contracts and all that jazz
[16:43:16] <lindenhurst> fun
[16:43:33] <lindenhurst> it got rid of the error, but added three more rows lol - https://jsfiddle.net/r65n75n1/6/
[16:43:52] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:43:57] <robertmaxrees> close./
[16:44:13] <lindenhurst> hehe yeah
[16:44:14] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[16:44:22] <robertmaxrees> tabledata should still have all those props
[16:44:29] <lindenhurst> kk
[16:45:00] <robertmaxrees> like.
[16:45:01] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[16:45:18] <robertmaxrees> match your full object structure always.
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> even if values are empty.
[16:45:34] <robertmaxrees> and then check in your render if you should/shouldn't render that oiut.
[16:46:33] <lindenhurst> https://jsfiddle.net/r65n75n1/7/
[16:46:51] <lindenhurst> makes sense
[16:47:01] <robertmaxrees> the idea is that the structure never inherently changes.
[16:47:10] <robertmaxrees> only the data changes.
[16:47:34] <lindenhurst> good idea
[16:53:10] <lindenhurst> deleting these last rows is gonna be tricky
[16:54:25] <robertmaxrees> don't delete 'em.
[16:54:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the minimum data you need to render a row?
[16:55:02] <lindenhurst> just those 9 steps
[16:55:09] <lindenhurst> I don't need the 3 last rows
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> right, so.
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> you could alwyays add a flag to the JSON for the output to check if it should render.
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[16:56:55] <lindenhurst> not sure how to do that
[16:57:11] <robertmaxrees> well, wait.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> some of the others only have a few of the fields populated.
[16:59:09] <lindenhurst> some of the others?
[16:59:38] <lindenhurst> the json structure should be matching now
[17:00:50] <lindenhurst> for the "tabledata" anyway
[17:01:09] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/9PHKgoK.png
[17:01:23] <robertmaxrees> these all have some unpopulated data.
[17:01:30] <robertmaxrees> so which fields must be populated.
[17:02:06] <lindenhurst> step, operating, equipment, info, and ppe
[17:02:13] <lindenhurst> operation*
[17:02:45] <lindenhurst> but I set the others to empty string
[17:02:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:02:56] <robertmaxrees> so then your function would do something like return tabledata.step && tabledata.operating && tabledata.equipment
[17:02:57] <robertmaxrees> etc
[17:03:29] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, don't send out rows that shouldn't be displayed at all.
[17:03:55] <lindenhurst> I'm confused.
[17:04:24] <lindenhurst> I got the error and that led to me matching the json data which created rows
[17:04:39] <lindenhurst> that I didn't want on the page
[17:04:58] <lindenhurst> So I added the matching json data and it fixed the error but added 3 new rows
[17:05:50] <lindenhurst> I understand why it's adding the 3 rows, but don't know how to get rid of it
[17:06:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering why they're in the JSON at all if you don't want them.,
[17:06:37] <lindenhurst> oh, I thought that's what you told me
[17:06:43] <lindenhurst> to have a matching structure
[17:06:50] <robertmaxrees> but
[17:06:59] <robertmaxrees> why were they there in the first place?
[17:07:15] <robertmaxrees> iof you don't want them to render, why are you including that data in the JSON at all?
[17:08:01] <lindenhurst> I want the 9 steps to render, but not the three rows
[17:08:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:08:20] <lindenhurst> do I remove the three "tabledata" objects from the json data?
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need them, why are they there?
[17:08:33] <lindenhurst> last three
[17:09:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ see my last question :)
[17:09:46] <lindenhurst>  robertmaxrees  match your full object structure always.
[17:09:52] <robertmaxrees> again
[17:10:00] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need them, why are they in the JSON in the first place?
[17:10:06] <robertmaxrees> going back before that suggestion.
[17:10:16] <robertmaxrees> they were already there - i'm wondering why.
[17:10:46] <lindenhurst> I get an error if I remove "tabledata" from the last three in the json data
[17:10:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> whya re those rows in there in the first place?
[17:11:05] <robertmaxrees> i keep asking the same question.
[17:11:15] <lindenhurst> I'm not getting it sorry
[17:11:20] <robertmaxrees> why are those three rows in the JSON if you don't need them?
[17:11:23] <lindenhurst> cause it loops through them all
[17:11:27] <lindenhurst> that's why it's there
[17:11:34] <lindenhurst> cause I have empty objects there
[17:11:35] <robertmaxrees> if they're not going to be displayed, why does the data have them?
[17:11:53] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting the data from?
[17:12:06] <lindenhurst> It's like a slide with steps
[17:12:18] <lindenhurst> let's say I have 11 slides
[17:12:21] <lindenhurst> 9 steps
[17:12:25] <lindenhurst> I don't need steps on 2 slides
[17:12:40] <lindenhurst> but I get an error if I leave it out on the 2 slides
[17:13:26] <robertmaxrees> by slide you mean "carousel"?
[17:14:00] <robertmaxrees> here's where I'm getting lost.
[17:14:22] <robertmaxrees> you have three objects in that array that you don't want to render out, right?
[17:14:23] <robertmaxrees> the last three.
[17:14:34] <robertmaxrees> right?
[17:15:06] <lindenhurst> I need the other data for other things, but I don't need "tabledata"
[17:15:28] <robertmaxrees> okay.  that's what I was getting at.
[17:15:44] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah, convenience method that checks to see if those props are defined.  if they are,. render it out.
[17:15:46] <robertmaxrees> if not, skip it.
[17:15:54] <lindenhurst> sorry I think I'm just frustrated with it at this point lol
[17:16:31] <lindenhurst> ah, check if the object is empty
[17:16:50] <robertmaxrees> check if those props are empty.
[17:16:56] <lindenhurst> right, gotcha
[17:17:02] <lindenhurst> sorry long day lol
[17:17:10] <lindenhurst> and I can describe anything for shit
[17:17:14] <lindenhurst> can't*
[17:18:01] <lindenhurst> I appreciate the help
[17:19:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r65n75n1/8/
[17:20:39] <lindenhurst> dam you!
[17:20:46] <lindenhurst> thank you so much
[17:35:30] <Onepamopa> guys, is there a selector $('.something').each(function (){    but "all" instead of "each" ? I need to check a bunch of checkboxes with the same class - whether or not all are checked or all are unchecked.
[17:35:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:36:12] <robertmaxrees> you just want to know if all checkboxes with a class are checked?
[17:36:24] <Onepamopa> more precisely - if all are unchecked
[17:36:37] <taplar> $(checkboxSelector).filter(':checked').length < 1
[17:37:48] <z1haze> can you make a delegated listener on the document?
[17:38:03] <z1haze> like $(document).on('click', '.privacy-policy', e => {
[17:38:15] <taplar> sure
[17:38:28] <z1haze> wonder why mine isnt workin
[17:40:16] <z1haze> anything weird with using arrow function on this?
[17:40:33] <taplar> depends on what you're doing in the arrow
[17:41:06] <z1haze> nothing with 'this'
[17:42:04] <taplar> should be fine then
[17:43:21] <z1haze> lol nvm
[17:43:26] <z1haze> i wasnt even requiring the file hahaha
[19:34:05] <goodenough> What's the difference between var foo = function(){};   vs   var foo = (function(){});
[19:36:46] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:38:12] <mariacheline> Is jQuery a thing in React.js?
[19:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's not (function() {}()); or (function() {})() goodenough
[19:38:44] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline jquery isn't included by default in riot afaik
[19:39:16] <mariacheline> Riot?
[19:39:22] <robertmaxrees> err, woops.
[19:39:24] <robertmaxrees> hahah misread that.
[19:39:31] <mariacheline> League lol?
[19:39:34] <mariacheline> XD
[19:39:44] <robertmaxrees> nah, riotjs is another js framework
[19:39:50] <mariacheline> Oh.. lok
[19:39:54] <mariacheline> Lol**
[19:40:00] <robertmaxrees> and react doesn't include jquery by default.
[19:40:11] <robertmaxrees> in fact, i'd probably avoid using jquery with it.
[19:40:12] <mariacheline> I mean can it be used?
[19:40:21] <robertmaxrees> it can be, but I'd seriously question why.
[19:40:22] <mariacheline> Yea I wouldn't either
[19:40:38] <mariacheline> How do you pass data to the backend?
[19:40:54] <robertmaxrees> using forms/ajax >.>
[19:41:24] <mariacheline> Isn't ajax part of jQuery? Lol sorry noob
[19:41:50] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline there's an ajax function, but you can do ajax outside of jquery.  it's not a jquery-oinly thing.
[19:42:49] <mariacheline> Oh.. I see
[19:42:56] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how you do it with react?
[19:43:02] <mariacheline> Yea kinda
[19:43:14] <mariacheline> I'm just wondering
[19:43:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a flux pattern lib to handle that part.
[19:43:48] <marcis> what is  XMLHttpRequest object?
[19:43:51] <marcis> How it looks?
[19:43:57] <mariacheline> And not ajax?
[19:44:00] <robertmaxrees> marsc it's one way to do ajax.
[19:44:40] <robertmaxrees> AJAX is short for "Asynchronous Javascript And XML" - the XML part is no longer really used and is often replaced with JSON these dayus.
[19:45:07] <robertmaxrees> but AJAX just means "your javascript is sending/recieving data to/from a server asynchronously"
[19:45:09] <mariacheline> I thought flux is just a pattern
[19:45:17] <growp> hello
[19:45:17] <mariacheline> Like a methodology
[19:45:32] <growp> how do you determine which attribute value the event has
[19:45:33] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline reread what i said :)
[19:45:43] <robertmaxrees> growp hrm? clarify?
[19:45:44] <mariacheline> Confused XD
[19:46:00] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline i said "i'd use a flux pattern lib to handle that part."
[19:46:02] <growp> <h1 value="HELLO">
[19:46:11] <robertmaxrees> as in "I'd use a library to follows the flux pattern"
[19:46:13] <growp> console.log(h1.attribute)
[19:46:16] <growp> something like that
[19:46:20] <robertmaxrees> growp erm
[19:46:23] <growp> and it returns HELLO
[19:46:25] <robertmaxrees> value isn't valid on h1 tags
[19:46:34] <mariacheline> I'd havo to read more about flux
[19:46:36] <growp> but do you understand what i am trying to do?
[19:46:55] <robertmaxrees> growp you mean "how do I read an attribute value in an event handler?"
[19:46:59] <growp> yes
[19:46:59] <growp> that
[19:47:07] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('id')_
[19:47:07] <growp> i don't know how to english technical terms
[19:47:10] <robertmaxrees> err, no _
[19:47:15] <mariacheline> What kind of library?
[19:47:19] <growp> jquery
[19:47:20] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('id'); <-
[19:47:26] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline huh?
[19:47:42] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline flux is a pattern.  there are a few libraries that follow that pattern.
[19:47:47] <mariacheline> What kind of flux lib?
[19:47:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean "which"?
[19:47:58] <mariacheline> Like redux -.-
[19:48:12] <robertmaxrees> redux is a flux-style lib.
[19:48:35] <robertmaxrees> when you say "what kind of flux style lib?", the question is kind of strange.
[19:48:58] <robertmaxrees> that's like saying "what color is the blue sky?"
[19:49:06] <mariacheline> XD
[19:51:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:51:26] <growp> https://jsbin.com/catuzubeze/edit?html,js,console,output
[19:51:42] <growp> it's not working =/
[19:51:47] <robertmaxrees> growp first off
[19:51:50] <robertmaxrees> e is the event object.
[19:51:54] <mariacheline> Still confused xD
[19:51:58] <growp> okay?
[19:52:10] <robertmaxrees> growp so it's not the element itself.
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[19:52:36] <growp> but e.target.value gives me the right value of the innerHTML thing
[19:52:40] <robertmaxrees> growp do you want the value of the clicked button?
[19:52:44] <growp> no
[19:52:50] <growp> i want the value of the value attribute
[19:52:52] <robertmaxrees> then what do you want?
[19:52:56] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:52:59] <robertmaxrees> which value attribute?
[19:53:05] <growp> whichever is clicked
[19:53:12] <robertmaxrees> that's literal;ly what i just said.
[19:53:13] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:53:16] <growp> button value="float"
[19:53:20] <growp> will return "float"
[19:53:22] <robertmaxrees> and for that, you want a delegated event handler.
[19:53:27] <growp> i found a flaw
[19:53:29] <growp> brb
[19:54:02] <robertmaxrees> growp https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cj27b2cn/
[19:54:03] <mariacheline> Anyway I've been banging my head learning react and react router
[19:54:19] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[19:54:20] <growp> <button value="num">1</button> ====> "num"
[19:54:24] <growp> that will return num
[19:54:30] <robertmaxrees> growp look at my fiddle.
[19:54:44] <growp> <button value="float">.</button> =====> "float"
[19:54:47] <robertmaxrees> duder
[19:54:50] <robertmaxrees> already show3ed you how.
[19:54:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:55:52] <growp> it's not what i want
[19:55:57] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:56:14] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted the value attribute of the button that was clicked.
[19:56:16] <robertmaxrees> that does exactly that.
[19:56:17] <growp> <button value="num">1</button>
[19:56:17] <growp> yes
[19:56:19] <growp> but no
[19:56:20] <mariacheline> How long till you create a discord chat app like using react when you completely know jack sht
[19:56:21] <mariacheline> ?
[19:56:23] <growp> you see the attribute value
[19:56:31] <robertmaxrees> Groenleer yes.
[19:56:32] <growp> that attribute has the text "num" in it
[19:56:37] <growp> i want to return "num"
[19:56:37] <robertmaxrees> err, growp
[19:56:52] <robertmaxrees> growp...
[19:56:59] <robertmaxrees> that's what my fiddle does.
[19:57:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cj27b2cn/
[19:57:15] <robertmaxrees> look at your console

[19:58:35] <mariacheline> You know discord? I kinda have to make somethig like that in react js but just the front end part
[19:58:53] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline and you're asking about how long that'll take?
[19:59:32] <growp> it doesn't do that =/ it's giving me the value of the inner html of the property
[19:59:39] <growp> oh wait
[19:59:43] <growp> i am dumb sorry
[19:59:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:59:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:59:53] <robertmaxrees> it's grabbing the value.

[20:00:02] <mariacheline> Yes
[20:00:17] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline literlaly nobody can answer that but you.
[20:00:49] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline lots of factors to account for.
[20:01:12] <mariacheline> You're right..
[20:01:52] <robertmaxrees> do you have a rough idea of how long it'll take you to do?
[20:10:48] <mariacheline> No idea..

[20:14:03] <avidaicu> hi all
[20:16:35] <mariacheline> I'm just ranting sorry lol
[20:17:30] <robertmaxrees> mariacheline all good :)
[20:17:30] <avidaicu> How to ignore the default value when an option already exists in multiple dropdowns - https://jsfiddle.net/L7svcmac/3/
[20:17:45] <avidaicu> any help much appreciated
[20:17:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:17:57] <robertmaxrees> "ignore" as in...?
[20:18:22] <avidaicu> i mean not include the default 'please Select' option
[20:18:43] <avidaicu> everything else but
[20:18:44] <robertmaxrees> check if the value contains "Please Select"
[20:18:56] <avidaicu> yea
[20:19:08] <robertmaxrees> Also: your handler is a little strange.
[20:19:17] <avidaicu> I tried that too although it doesn't work using jquery 1.7.2
[20:19:27] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "doesn't work"?
[20:19:37] <robertmaxrees> .val().indexOf('Please Select') > -1
[20:21:18] <robertmaxrees> there's a much easier way to do this :)
[20:21:36] <avidaicu> https://jsfiddle.net/L7svcmac/4/
[20:21:45] <avidaicu> didn't work either
[20:21:56] <avidaicu> how would you have done it?
[20:22:13] <robertmaxrees> well, your last one doesnt' work because your logic is afterthe aler.
[20:22:18] <robertmaxrees> *after the alert.
[20:22:41] <avidaicu> yea true
[20:30:38] <avidaicu> what about https://jsfiddle.net/L7svcmac/5/
[20:31:05] <robertmaxrees> avidaicu why are you doing $('#table1').find('select option[value='+$(this).val()+']:selected') ?
[20:31:05] <avidaicu> still not sure how I would exclude the default value
[20:32:20] <avidaicu> couse I need to dig down and find the value that's chosen
[20:32:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:32:26] <avidaicu> in the droplist
[20:32:31] <robertmaxrees> you can do that with $('select').val()
[20:32:41] <avidaicu> sorry not too experienced but eager to learn
[20:32:51] <robertmaxrees> ^ learning moment right there :)
[20:33:10] <avidaicu> ok thanks
[20:37:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L7svcmac/7/
[20:37:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like this.
[20:38:24] <robertmaxrees> since the default value is an empty string, you can just do if (currentValue) - empty strings are falsy.
[20:39:28] <avidaicu> thanks
[20:40:11] <avidaicu> although it needs to default back to the default value if it finds a duplicate
[20:40:58] <robertmaxrees> $(this).val('');
[20:40:59] <avidaicu> eg. 'Ireland Ireland' should default back to 'Ireland Please Select'
[20:43:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, ^
[20:46:18] <avidaicu> hmm
[20:46:25] <robertmaxrees> lost?
[20:46:47] <avidaicu> yea
[20:46:55] <avidaicu> lol
[20:47:03] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've tried.
[20:47:28] <avidaicu> .map(function()?
[20:47:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:47:40] <robertmaxrees> to reset the value?
[20:47:58] <robertmaxrees> skip that for a second.
[20:48:08] <avidaicu> but it doesn't reset it
[20:48:16] <robertmaxrees> you want to reset the value if a duplicate has been chosen, right?
[20:48:31] <avidaicu> yea
[20:48:36] <robertmaxrees> so.
[20:48:53] <robertmaxrees> where in the code are we handling when a duplicate has been chosen?
[20:49:12] <avidaicu> I thought the code is already resetting something but it's not workiing
[20:49:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not resetting anything.
[20:49:28] <robertmaxrees> it's logging out when a duplicate has been found.
[20:49:31] <avidaicu> ok
[20:49:44] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your dev tools?
[20:49:50] <avidaicu> yea
[20:49:51] <avidaicu> return currentSelectValue === currentValue;
[20:49:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:50:06] <robertmaxrees> look at where it's logging out duder.
[20:50:07] <avidaicu> if (valueAlreadySelected && currentValue) {
[20:50:10] <robertmaxrees> bingop
[20:50:12] <robertmaxrees> *bingo
[20:50:18] <robertmaxrees> those var names are pretty clear :)
[20:50:26] <avidaicu> yea
[20:50:34] <robertmaxrees> so you'd put that logic in ther.e
[20:51:36] <avidaicu> ok
[20:51:59] <robertmaxrees> if you get lost again share the updated fiddle :)
[20:52:57] <avidaicu> ar we storing the default value anywhere yet?
[20:53:04] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[20:53:14] <robertmaxrees> you just want to kick them back to "please select", right?
[20:53:24] <avidaicu> yep
[20:53:33] <robertmaxrees> no need to store anytthing, then.
[20:53:34] <avidaicu> let me try first
[20:53:39] <robertmaxrees> if you try my suggestion, you'll see it works.
[20:53:45] <robertmaxrees> $(this).val('')
[20:57:34] <avidaicu> got it  - https://jsfiddle.net/L7svcmac/11/
[20:57:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:58:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L7svcmac/12/
[20:58:10] <robertmaxrees> literally just needed $(this).val(''); :)
[20:58:34] <avidaicu> that didn't work
[20:58:39] <robertmaxrees> works fine here
[20:58:43] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[20:58:56] <avidaicu> ah sorry it did now
[20:59:03] <avidaicu> I tried that
[20:59:13] <avidaicu> https://jsfiddle.net/L7svcmac/14/
[20:59:30] <robertmaxrees> also: why use an alert there?
[20:59:31] <avidaicu> you're a legend, thanks mate!!!
[20:59:49] <avidaicu> could have used dev tools too
[20:59:58] <robertmaxrees> :) avoid alerts.
[21:00:01] <robertmaxrees> they break things.
[21:00:31] <avidaicu> thank you so much, really appreciate it
[21:00:42] <robertmaxrees> definitely
[21:01:40] <avidaicu> I'm going to try and inject some text in the html so that it displays some validation text instead
[21:02:27] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with that data-bind attribute?
[21:02:37] <robertmaxrees> you using a framework or some kind of library?
[21:03:06] <avidaicu> we use knockout for our forms
[21:03:12] <avidaicu> knockout.js
[21:03:28] <robertmaxrees> errm
[21:03:48] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you doing your validation via knockout?
[21:04:06] <avidaicu> learning curve
[21:04:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:04:15] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
