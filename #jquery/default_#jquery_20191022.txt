[04:42:06] <Paradisee> hello guys
[04:42:22] <Paradisee> i have 5 inputs which accept 1 number each
[04:42:54] <Paradisee> when the user type a number the cursor goes to the next input and so on
[04:43:06] <Paradisee> it works on desktop pcs, but not on android
[04:43:36] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0QA9K5Q#line-11
[04:43:41] <Paradisee> any help?
[05:21:13] <Cork> Paradisee: mobile browsers does a lot of funky things with the inputs (in some cases they even put an overlay and not using the page input at all)
[05:21:38] <Cork> Paradisee: my recommendation is to add a textfield under in the page and print debug data in there from the event
[05:21:43] <Cork> so you know where it fails
[05:22:12] <Paradisee> well i know for sure its the keycode
[05:22:21] <Paradisee> it does not go into that condition
[05:22:37] <Cork> also i would prob reconstruct it to use input instead of keyup, as keyup doens't work with pasted data, and quite badly with ime
[05:23:05] <Cork> and by input i mean on('input', ) instead of keyup(
[06:25:46] <Paradisee> Cork: i solved the problem changing  to: let key = event.which || this.value.substr(-1).charCodeAt(0);
[06:25:57] <Paradisee> and i've used an input event aswell
[06:26:11] <Paradisee> now i need to solve another strange problem
[06:26:27] <Paradisee> i basically need to use a mutationObserver on a tag
[06:26:46] <Paradisee> but i get this: Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'observe' on 'MutationObserver': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'.
[06:26:57] <Paradisee> observer.observe(targetNode, config);
[06:27:16] <Paradisee> where targetNode is a getElementsbyTagName
[06:30:00] <Paradisee> might be the node is still not there?
[06:40:40] <Paradisee> solved with a recursive method
[07:04:55] <jubalh> in https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity-im.github.io i would like the reference.html moved to guide/070/reference.html (and guide/latest/reference.html). but this file includes (via jquery)  main_fragment.html and  	toc_fragment.html. those fragments are generated by profanity. thats why we include them like this. so when i move all 3 files to guide/070/ and adjust the paths in them. they still dont
[07:05:01] <jubalh> show. and i dont know why. i tried absolute and relative paths in jquery. do you have any idea?
[07:06:08] <Cork> jubalh: not sure how this is related to this channel
[07:06:23] <Cork> jquery uses ajax to grab a resource from an url
[07:06:30] <Cork> if the resource exists it loads it
[07:06:46] <Cork> how the resource url is generated is completely up to the project
[07:07:06] <jubalh> Cork: because i think maybe jquery is either not supporting relative location or i'm doing something wrong
[07:07:15] <jubalh> and maybe someone in this channel who is familiar with jquery can help me doing it
[07:07:20] <Cork> jubalh: jquery doesn't support anything
[07:07:28] <Cork> it just gives the url to the browser
[07:07:47] <Cork> and as long as you run it in a normal webbrowser relative, absolut and full urls are fully supported
[07:07:55] <jubalh> hmm
[07:07:57] <jubalh> i see
[07:08:04] <jubalh> strange. I'll try it again
[07:08:59] <Cork> jubalh: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/xhr.js#L27
[07:09:23] <Cork> and xhr.open === (new window.XMLHttpRequest()).open()
[07:10:18] <jubalh> so $("#ref_toc_include").load("guide/070/toc_fragment.html");  should work
[07:11:15] <Cork> as long as the current page is a sibling to guide ya
[07:11:28] <Cork> note where the js is doesn't matter
[07:11:39] <Cork> the html page is what sets the relative path
[07:12:03] <Cork> (why relative urls is normally avoiced in favor of absolute)
[07:13:22] <Cork> and it also means the relative path will change if you use navigation.history.pushState
[07:13:33] <jubalh> so if reference.html is located in guide/070 and toc_framgent is too then $("#ref_toc_include").load("toc_fragment.html"); should just work, right?
[07:13:42] <Cork> yes
[07:14:05] <Cork> check in the browser network tab in developer tools and you will see what url the browser requests
[07:16:17] <jubalh> If I do so, it looks like this http://iodoru.org/f/showprof.png instead of like this https://profanity-im.github.io/reference.html
[07:16:29] <jubalh> ok' will try those tools
[07:16:42] <Cork> ya, don't ask us to debug images
[07:16:49] <Cork> cause that is bordering to rude...
[07:17:43] <jubalh> I even pasted you the link to the repo
[07:17:51] <jubalh> so that actually you can take a look at the sources
[07:18:07] <jubalh> the image is the alternative of breaking the actual website my friend
[07:18:15] <Cork> ya, but i don't render html in my head, so if you have rendering problems the source isn't helping
[07:18:40] <jubalh> what i would do if it were a subject that i'm knowledge of would be to clone the thing, and run xdg-open reference.html
[07:18:48] <jubalh> and then i wouldnt need to render it but could see it
[07:19:03] <jubalh> i'm not a webdeveler, and i only take care of this open source project website because nooone else is doing it
[07:19:23] <jubalh> i'm not sure why it's so hard to get a little help with it.
[07:21:02] <Cork> cause if you want someone to pull the code, set up the site and debug your problem for it; it isn't "a little help" then it is paid help
[07:21:14] <Cork> if you want free help; that you can get here
[07:21:15] <jubalh> laughable
[07:21:28] <Cork> YOU have to do the legwork, and ppl can help you understand what you are looking at
[07:21:40] <jubalh> which is what is happening here
[07:22:27] <Cork> except you want us to magically figure out why you get rendering errors from a picgure of the page...
[07:22:38] <jubalh> do you know how much free time i invest in helping open source projects? and then when one needs a bit help from a webdeveloper he tells you that if you ask him a question, that he also is nto able to answer, he tells you it should be paid work
[07:22:58] <jubalh> even though i tried my best to find it out myself, to post the ilnk to the repo, by showing ap picutre of what is happening
[07:23:01] <jubalh> this is super sad
[07:23:15] <Cork> ok, i'm off, find someone else to help you
[07:23:29] <jubalh> I'll try
[18:53:21] <caliel> good morning #jquery
[18:53:41] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:54:32] <caliel> in a twig template, I test for some conditions, and if I have one or multiple conditions I create a <div data-rel="popup"> element. In my code I have something like $.each('*[data-rel^="element"]').function() { execute ajax }
[18:55:02] <caliel> The problem is when I have multiple "popups" element, I would like to execute one after one. How can I do that?
[18:55:44] <robertmaxrees> caliel any particular reason you want to do that?
[18:56:39] <robertmaxrees> like - why do you want to execute each one in turn?
[18:57:10] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[18:58:02] <caliel> robertmaxrees: i.e. I have an User which has to change password because credentials is expired AND has to upgrade her profile... So I will have a popup for a credentials call, and a popup for a profile call.
[18:58:23] <robertmaxrees> sorry - I dropped after I said "bbiab"
[18:58:35] <robertmaxrees> and hrm.  something here seems... strange.
[18:58:36] <caliel> Using $.each() as I do, only the very last popup (modal) is executed
[18:58:46] <robertmaxrees> also - that's the wrong each fwiw.
[18:59:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry, gotta drop again.  bbiab.
[19:03:30] <caliel> Good night #jquery
