[02:49:36] <diverdude> hi, I have these buttons: https://jsfiddle.net/f397ubxh/ where i have defined the :active state in css. I want to trigger this state from jquery on a key press, such that its shown visibly what arrowkey is pressed. How do i set :active from jquery?
[05:38:06] <asdfgh> hello a good iamge crop library that allow me to crop an image and then upload it to the server
[05:49:02] <thykka> you don't need a library for that
[05:49:32] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage
[06:05:27] <asdfgh> thykka, canvas? hmm never used... are supported on mobile too ?
[06:06:32] <thykka> y
[06:07:41] <asdfgh> thykka, so basically you are saying that i can crop the img inside the canvas and then upload
[06:07:42] <asdfgh> ?
[06:07:57] <thykka> yup
[06:08:15] <IhrFussel> Hello... 'return false' inside a .submit() should work in every browser correct?
[06:09:56] <IhrFussel> $("#msgf").submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); ser = $('#sendi').val(); if(ser==""){ return false } << that's my code
[06:10:36] <thykka> you're already preventing the default, not sure if returning false does much there
[06:11:28] <thykka> it does additionally stop propagation
[06:11:41] <IhrFussel> After that condition the post query executes which I want to prevent though so a condition is needed
[06:13:20] <asdfgh> thinced_, maybe with cancas we will work with recent browsers only
[06:13:27] <asdfgh> is not too risky?
[06:13:41] <thykka> asdfgh, https://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas
[06:14:00] <thykka> if you care about IE8, then yeah, it's a problem
[06:14:03] <thykka> but who does?
[06:18:46] <IhrFussel> Okay it was a user error, not jquery
[06:21:51] <asdfgh> thykka, Ok you are right but, what does it mean "basic support" how can i undestand if this image "manipulation" is a "basic" opration ?
[06:22:13] <thykka> by reading the information provided
[06:23:20] <thykka> caniuse links to the specification of the feature, which in this case is https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-canvas-element
[06:23:36] <thykka> and we can see drawImage is defined in that spec
[06:24:10] <asdfgh> ok
[06:25:45] <asdfgh> thanks
[06:28:23] <asdfgh> thykka, wait..pardon, with canvas i can crop that image but, is it also possible to load a image there via "upload" input field?
[06:28:51] <thykka> yes, although you wouldn't technically be uploading anything, as canvas processing happens client-side
[06:29:00] <karstenk> I would like to animate a svg logo file. What is best way to do it?
[06:29:18] <thykka> animate how?
[06:30:17] <karstenk> building all objects together and split  something like this is for a non-profit project club logo animation at top of the touchscreen locked screen
[06:30:26] <karstenk> :)
[06:30:32] <asdfgh> thykka, ok
[06:30:34] <karstenk> some cooul effekt
[06:30:52] <karstenk> you can inspire me
[06:31:01] <thykka> karstenk, should be doable with CSS or SVG animations
[06:31:20] <thykka> depending on the complexity, some JS could be beneficial
[13:05:35] <z1haze> $.ajax can .then right?
[13:09:25] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/e04503ba79ad im not getting my console.log('done') but no errors and the ajax call is happening  to select shipping method
[13:21:02] <z1haze> you can .then an $.ajax right? My console log here isnt triggering, but the select shipping method ajax call is working: https://bpaste.net/show/e04503ba79ad
[13:27:14] <robertmaxrees> pop a console log in the catch
[13:27:18] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of jquery?
[13:27:59] <robertmaxrees> also: $.get() returns a promise, too.
[13:28:51] <robertmaxrees> z1haze
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:50:03] <z1haze> hey, sorry man. im here now. checking
[13:51:30] <z1haze> interesting, so it is triggering the catch but a status of 200
[13:51:32] <z1haze> im confused
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> what data are you getting back?
[13:52:30] <z1haze> a promise _i think_
[13:52:33] <z1haze> responseText: "{↵  "action": "COShipping-SelectShippingMethod",↵  "queryString": "",↵  "locale": "default"↵}"
[13:52:39] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> you can't get a promise back from the server you're posting to.
[13:53:00] <z1haze> well im not really sure what you call the http response of a catch
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> you.. don't?
[13:53:11] <z1haze> it has the abort, alwys, catch, promise, readtySTate, etc
[13:53:17] <robertmaxrees> the actual response from the server.
[13:53:19] <robertmaxrees> checky our network tab.
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> and look there.
[13:53:23] <z1haze> i know that man
[13:53:28] <z1haze> im just saying i dont know what you call it
[13:53:36] <robertmaxrees> is it json?
[13:53:45] <z1haze> when you catch its never json
[13:53:49] <robertmaxrees> dude
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> look at the network tab for the raw response from the server.
[13:53:59] <z1haze> ha let me know you what i mean
[13:54:00] <z1haze> i am!
[13:54:12] <z1haze> im saying i dont know what this object is called, hang on
[13:54:18] <robertmaxrees> so then share it :)
[13:54:21] <robertmaxrees> my guess is your dataType is breaking things.
[13:54:36] <z1haze> https://www.dropbox.com/s/vy2r19l2cr6g8kk/see.PNG?dl=0
[13:54:49] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm asking for.
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> but close enough - that's not valid JSON
[13:55:26] <z1haze> https://www.dropbox.com/s/dc1h93bdzwfxw1j/see2.PNG?dl=0
[13:55:29] <z1haze> it is i think
[13:55:39] <z1haze> {
[13:55:39] <z1haze>   "action": "COShipping-SelectShippingMethod",
[13:55:39] <z1haze>   "queryString": "",
[13:55:39] <z1haze>   "locale": "default"
[13:55:39] <z1haze> }
[13:55:45] <z1haze> that looks like json to me
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> kill the dataType from your ajax config.
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't fix it, paste the json into a paste service - my irc client likes to screw with data.
[13:57:32] <z1haze> it did fix it.. but its json so i dont undersatnd
[13:58:23] <robertmaxrees> could be bad quotes around properties, a bad dataType defined by the server for the response, etc.
[13:58:36] <robertmaxrees> basically, don't manually set the dataType unless you really need to.
[13:59:06] <z1haze> sounds good
[13:59:18] <z1haze> so just for my knowledge the first screenshot is the object that is caught
[13:59:21] <z1haze> what is that actually called
[13:59:28] <z1haze> that's what i was saying i dont know what that is
[13:59:40] <z1haze> i thought it was the ajax instance
[13:59:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the actual response from the server pasted into a paste servive.
[13:59:46] <robertmaxrees> *service
[13:59:51] <robertmaxrees> and that the jqXHR object
[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> which is a promise.
[14:00:12] <robertmaxrees> but that whole object isn't coming from your server.,
[14:01:52] <z1haze> i know that
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:02:09] <z1haze> so i was correct when i said, just conflated what you were asking
[14:02:25] <z1haze> anyhow im not going to worry aobut why it didnt like the dataType
[14:02:27] <z1haze> im good without it :D
[14:02:47] <robertmaxrees> i was just asking for the response from the server, so sending me a screenshot of the jqXHR in the console was confusing :)
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> and i would worry about it since that means your server isn't properly configured
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> or you're not actually outputting JSON
[14:03:28] <z1haze> yeah, and either way i can't fix it because all ican do is call res.json and pass it an object
[14:03:31] <z1haze> heh
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> could be a header misconfiguration :)
[14:03:50] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[14:04:02] <z1haze> right, i cant change those
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why not?
[14:04:18] <z1haze> only can call res.json if i want to return json
[14:04:22] <z1haze> man, we went through this the other day
[14:04:27] <z1haze> so much i cant do
[14:04:36] <robertmaxrees> super confused but alright
[14:04:49] <z1haze> you forget the talk about using a salesforce ecommerce platform
[14:04:54] <robertmaxrees> oh that.
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> i barely remember what i ate for breakfast, and i eat the same thing every day ;)
[14:05:09] <z1haze> its very black box like, so yeah
[14:05:12] <z1haze> haha dang man
[14:05:25] <z1haze> im actually hungry now, bbl
[14:05:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, well aware.  i'm currently wrestling with the liveagent snap-in
[14:09:27] <z1haze> deja vu
[16:11:52] <z1haze> anyone who uses jquery.validate I am having a small issue after I started implemented code splitting and dynamic module loading.. i guess it has sometihng to do with the validate() not being executed on dom ready anymore. but my issue is that when i call the validate function to setup the form validation its adding all of the errors to the page
[16:13:28] <makr8100> vanilla js question: delete myObj['myKey'] removes the key, but then leaves behind myObj[''] = 'undefined'
[16:13:33] <makr8100> why?
[16:15:22] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 huh?
[16:15:57] <z1haze> O.o
[16:15:57] <makr8100> I'll make a fiddle, gimme a sec
[16:16:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1vdj3tbn/2/ not sure i'm following your issue.
[16:16:39] <z1haze> robert you use jquery.validate?
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you sure it's not running the initi on pageload?
[16:16:46] <robertmaxrees> *init
[16:16:46] <makr8100> of course that was oversimplification of code, hold on a minute
[16:17:04] <z1haze> to my knowledge the only way to initialize it is to call validate() and pass settings
[16:17:32] <z1haze> when i was doing it on on load it was fine, but now im doing a on demand module loading so its delayed and it immediately validates the form and applies errors.. very strange side effect
[16:17:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:18:27] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea then.
[16:18:29] <z1haze> if theres a quiet way to initialize it that may be the key but i do not believe that's athing
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> do you happen to be calling the .form() method somewhere?
[16:20:57] <z1haze> on validator?
[16:21:05] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:21:14] <z1haze> nope
[16:21:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno then.
[16:21:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it :)
[16:21:29] <z1haze> yeah, its also only doing this to one of the forms on the page
[16:21:33] <z1haze> the other seems normal
[16:22:49] <makr8100> ah, firefox only...  worked in chrome
[16:26:46] <z1haze> had, type
[16:26:55] <z1haze> wow, botched that. had a typo
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> oh, issue caused by a typo?
[16:27:20] <z1haze> had .valid().checkForm(), needed .validate().checkForm()
[16:27:23] <z1haze> yeah
[16:27:23] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:30:01] <makr8100> https://jsfiddle.net/makr8100/atcknbr9
[16:30:33] <makr8100> gah...
[16:30:34] <makr8100> https://jsfiddle.net/makr8100/atcknbr9/4/
[16:31:22] <makr8100> well it's behaving for me now but my original isn't... >.<
[17:14:43] <makr8100> aha!  now it's good an broken https://jsfiddle.net/makr8100/atcknbr9/10/
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> :|
[17:15:16] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug?
[17:17:16] <makr8100> click back and forth between the buttons
[17:17:29] <robertmaxrees> and what's the bug?
[17:17:42] <makr8100> wait...  id is undefined in that fiddle, not the same issue I was seeing
[17:19:11] <makr8100> jeez it's still not doing it...  In my actual site the object h contains "" = "undefined"
[17:19:46] <robertmaxrees> string undefined?
[17:19:59] <makr8100> yes, but the key is double quotes
[17:20:09] <makr8100> I screwed up the fiddle again anyways, working on it again
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're doing some type coercion somewhere.
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd head over to ##javascript for more help makr8100
[17:22:04] <al_nz1> I have literally just pasted this code from my IDE into a jsfiddle and it works in the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/ygj5Lqes/3/ - but I get null for gender when run locally  - anyone know why that might be?
[17:24:03] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 first - use console.log() instead of alert
[17:24:14] <robertmaxrees> second - actually scope your vars :)
[17:25:35] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what scope should gender me
[17:25:36] <al_nz1> be
[17:25:44] <robertmaxrees> to the event handler?
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/j1n3y650/
[17:26:20] <al_nz1> but thats a side issue, I can type $("input[type='radio'][name='radioGender']:checked").val() into my browser console locally and I get ""
[17:26:21] <robertmaxrees> tho i'm confused abvout why you're doing it that way.
[17:26:45] <robertmaxrees> try $("input[type='radio'][name='radioGender']").length in your dev tools - what do you get?
[17:27:26] <al_nz1> 3
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> then do $("input[type='radio'][name='radioGender']:checked").length
[17:29:18] <al_nz1> its working now....
[17:29:26] <al_nz1> I am not quite sure what I did to fix it
[17:29:29] <al_nz1> but there you go
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> probably a caching issue
[17:29:34] <al_nz1> maybe it was your influence
[17:29:46] <al_nz1> (nah just take the credit ok?) :-)
[17:30:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:32:55] <al_nz1> curse it
[17:33:00] <al_nz1> its back to giving me nothing
[17:33:13] <al_nz1> length and checked length are 3 and 1
[17:33:19] <robertmaxrees> so stick that second .length check at the top of the handler.
[17:34:11] <al_nz1> the one with checked
[17:34:22] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:36:43] <al_nz1> yes it says 1
[17:37:04] <robertmaxrees> what about console.log($("input[type='radio'][name='radioGender']:checked").val());
[17:37:04] <al_nz1> when i click the button
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> if that console.log of the .val() is working but you're still gett "null", make sure you make the corrections I noted before.
[17:38:00] <al_nz1> nothing
[17:38:05] <robertmaxrees> with the .val()?
[17:38:11] <al_nz1> yes
[17:38:29] <robertmaxrees> what about $.fn.jquery?
[17:38:55] <al_nz1> in browser console?
[17:39:02] <al_nz1> or console.log it?
[17:39:07] <robertmaxrees> just pop in your console
[17:39:33] <al_nz1> 1.9.1
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> and you scoped that "gener" var down, right?
[17:39:52] <robertmaxrees> *gender
[17:39:54] <makr8100> I give up on this madness
[17:39:58] <makr8100> delete h[''];
[17:40:00] <makr8100> done
[17:40:11] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 i'd fix the underlying issue
[17:40:19] <robertmaxrees> you're just masking a more severe bug
[17:40:55] <makr8100> a complete copy/paste won't reproduce and I can't duplicate my dynamic content
[17:42:07] <robertmaxrees> also: for...in loops are a bad idea.
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> and your issue is likely that you're getting type coercion between .data() and and your concatenation stuff.
[17:43:41] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes I did var gender
[17:43:49] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[17:45:01] <al_nz1> https://pastebin.com/QNrUHE0D
[17:45:21] <robertmaxrees> okay hold WAY up
[17:45:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:45:40] <robertmaxrees> delete the alert completely.
[17:45:49] <al_nz1> https://pastebin.com/x8c48U4s
[17:46:17] <al_nz1> ok alert gone
[17:46:27] <robertmaxrees> now update the fiddle with all this new code
[17:46:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:46:36] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it's not 100%
[17:46:41] <robertmaxrees> functional
[17:47:51] <al_nz1> yes it works in the fiddle - but it always ahas
[17:47:56] <al_nz1> has worked in fiddle
[17:48:15] <robertmaxrees> show me with all the code?
[17:48:32] <al_nz1> you mean doc ready as well? or
[17:49:03] <robertmaxrees> just the click handler for now.
[17:49:28] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/e45nwur8/2/
[17:49:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:49:44] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[17:49:52] <robertmaxrees> there's extra code in your pastes that's not in this fiddle.
[17:50:38] <al_nz1> those inputs arent even in the fiddle inputs
[17:50:54] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[17:50:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno why i'm even trying.
[17:51:09] <robertmaxrees> if you can't repro the issue in a fiddle and don't wanna show me all the relevant code, dunno.
[17:51:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry :(
[17:51:20] <al_nz1> teamviewer?
[17:51:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:51:29] <al_nz1> :)
[17:51:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm at work duder ;)
[17:51:47] <robertmaxrees> plus https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions
[17:51:52] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need something that involved.
[17:52:20] <al_nz1> well, I could take all that other code out so its not a factor....how about that?
[17:52:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:53:20] <al_nz1> since this code locally is in a modal, let me create the modal in the fiddle
[17:58:54] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:59:08] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/y6homsL4/3/ - with the modal
[17:59:11] <al_nz1> still works!
[17:59:29] <makr8100> found it, was being modified by a different function that I have no idea why it was running...  well at least it's safer now, thanks for looking
[18:48:25] <robertmaxrees> so al_nz1 - are you actually getting Null as the value?
[19:00:07] <Taplar> you're definitely getting null as a response
[19:00:34] <Taplar> g'night
[19:29:32] <sydbarret> can you help by telling me why the checkbox is not on the left? https://jsfiddle.net/vfbmx8d2/  ?
[23:00:47] <sydbarret> hi, i have similar to this https://jsfiddle.net/o03kr1ua/3/
[23:00:59] <sydbarret> also a button at the top to process the selected rows
[23:01:17] <sydbarret> how can i perhaps first render the id of the rows and make them invisible
[23:01:38] <sydbarret> and the when button is hit loop through it
[23:01:50] <sydbarret> im using flask with jinja
[23:04:40] <sydbarret> the button to submit is a datatable button
[23:09:01] <pavonia> What exactly are you trying to do? Show the table only when a button is clicked?
[23:12:10] <sydbarret> pavonia no, loop through the checkboxes that are checked
[23:23:18] <sydbarret> oh its already implemented in the button i guess
