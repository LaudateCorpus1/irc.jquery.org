[00:03:41] <uncovery> hey guys, I am trying to change the CSS of an element via it´s ID, but I get a ¨Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #element-id¨  in the console, any idea whats wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/1019772/
[00:22:31] <pavonia> "404 That page doesn't exist."
[00:25:15] <uncovery> sorry
[00:25:20] <uncovery> thanks for helping
[00:25:41] <uncovery> I developed into another question now...
[00:26:34] <uncovery> from what I know, HTML 5 allows any ID name as long as there are no spaces in it. is JQuery different here? can I use commas? dashes?
[00:30:53] <pavonia> Not sure about commas but dashes for sure
[00:31:37] <pavonia> uncovery: Have you tried escaping with '\'?
[00:32:13] <uncovery> ok thanks!
[00:32:15] <uncovery> will do that
[00:50:15] <Cork> you can litteraly use ANY character in ids, classes and attributes
[00:50:21] <Cork> inclusive spaces
[00:50:31] <Cork> pavonia, uncovery: ^
[00:50:46] <Cork> you just need to escpe them if you plan to use them in a selector
[00:56:08] <shoky> heh you can't use space in classes :P
[00:56:56] <Cork> well you can as far as css is conserned, but it will have problem from the attribute parser
[00:56:58] <shoky> in a class, that is. in the class attribute, sure
[00:57:13] <Cork> same with attribute names (as space spearates them too)
[00:57:25] <Cork> but css doesn't care
[00:57:57] <Cork> and actually i haven't tried adding a class with classList.add('some space')
[00:58:00] <shoky> sure, it's just meaningless to talk of a space in a class
[00:58:06] <shoky> and classList.add deoesnt work
[00:58:14] <Cork> it gives you error?
[00:58:19] <shoky> yea
[00:58:24] <Cork> interesting
[00:58:37] <shoky> InvalidCharacterError: String contains an invalid character   in firefox
[00:59:30] <shoky> what would the value of the class attribute be, if that were possible
[00:59:44] <shoky> that's why i say meaningless :p
[00:59:55] <Cork> possibly a entity encoding i guess
[01:01:47] <shoky> not worth it, thankfully
[07:12:34] <JProgram> hello
[07:14:08] <JProgram> why does iframe not append to the body after i do iframe.load?
[07:14:26] <JProgram> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54005315/iframe-download-doesnt-appear-on-browser this is my problem
[07:15:20] <Woet> JProgram: why are you using hidden iframes instead of ajax?
[07:15:42] <Woet> also, .load is not meant for iframes. not sure what gave you that idea.
[07:15:43] <JProgram> Oh I tried but couldnt make it work
[07:16:01] <JProgram> Im only trying to trigger a download, then do actions after its loaded
[07:16:03] <Woet> so share your actual non-iframe code
[07:16:05] <Woet> with ajax
[07:16:31] <JProgram> yes
[07:16:45] <JProgram> could you give an example perhaps? im sorry im new to js
[07:26:50] <JProgram> Woet
[07:26:52] <JProgram> https://jsfiddle.net/qezrhyfv/34/
[07:26:58] <JProgram> im getting a 403 error when i  do this
[07:27:01] <JProgram> what's wrong with this code
[07:27:21] <Woet> 403 error is a server error
[07:27:23] <Woet> ask your app
[07:27:48] <JProgram> is the js code right though
[07:28:27] <Woet> check your network tab on chrome
[07:28:30] <Woet> if the request is sent properly
[07:30:18] <JProgram> Woet i dont see error back end
[07:30:26] <JProgram> because the controller is called and the excel is exported
[07:30:31] <Woet> JProgram: 	check your network tab on chrome
[07:32:15] <JProgram> i look at export
[07:32:20] <JProgram> it says post 200 status OK
[07:32:43] <JProgram> failed to load response data
[07:33:20] <JProgram> Woet how do i  get 403 when everything seems fine
[07:33:26] <Woet> JProgram: check your network tab on chrome
[07:33:33] <JProgram> well i did
[07:33:35] <Woet> it tells you the request data and response data
[07:33:49] <Woet> javascript code is not capable of causing 403.s
[07:33:54] <Woet> 403s
[07:44:58] <JProgram> Woet ok i made it work
[07:45:08] <JProgram> its posting but im not receiving an excel download
[07:45:09] <JProgram> why?
[07:46:01] <JProgram> im using ajax but im not getting a download
[07:46:57] <JProgram> "use ajax, it will work then"
[07:47:04] <JProgram> >uses ajax, it doesnt work
[07:47:07] <JProgram> lmao nice help
[07:47:15] <JProgram> Woet
[07:47:21] <Woet> JProgram: because you're not doing anything in the success handler.
[07:47:26] <Woet> JProgram: I never said "use ajax and it will work"
[07:47:33] <Woet> JProgram: all depends on your (lacking) learning skills
[07:47:36] <JProgram> that;s the part i dont know
[07:47:38] <Woet> JProgram: anyways, since you wanna be this way, good luck.
[07:47:42] <JProgram> and i was looking for
[07:48:07] <JProgram> yeah right as if you were so helpful in the first place
[07:48:12] <JProgram> damn im gonna miss it
[12:42:54] <gambl0re> hello?
[14:43:49] <jjrabbit> what's up guys
[14:44:16] <jjrabbit> i'm trying to animate an alement upwards, and back down to its original location but i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong
[14:44:27] <jjrabbit> anyone mind taking a look
[14:44:28] <jjrabbit> ?
[14:44:56] <jjrabbit> https://jsfiddle.net/47qaL0v2/
[15:15:39] <AleDev> hi
[15:16:05] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[15:16:46] <AleDev> I am having problem with ajax request
[15:16:54] <robertmaxrees> alright, what's up?
[15:17:08] <AleDev> is this the right place?
[15:17:15] <robertmaxrees> are you using jQuery?
[15:17:46] <AleDev> yes, the main concern in about CORS
[15:18:00] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, ask away.
[15:19:16] <AleDev> in chrome with an extension I can disable cors and I make the request without problem
[15:19:39] <AleDev> but in android chrome is the problem
[15:20:38] <robertmaxrees> for CORS, you mean?
[15:20:48] <AleDev> I try to do an app to access a service by ajax, in desktop work but don't in android
[15:21:14] <robertmaxrees> do you control the server you're trying to ajax data from?
[15:22:10] <AleDev> cos is debugger panel say the error I guess that it the problemen in androi also
[15:22:25] <robertmaxrees> do you control the server you're trying to ajax data from?
[15:23:21] <AleDev> nop the server is manage by other and not is my own
[15:23:31] <robertmaxrees> then there's nothing you can really do :(
[15:23:56] <robertmaxrees> the only way around it would be to create a proxy service on your server and have that as a go-between
[15:24:30] <AleDev> I try to change the header to change the origin and other stuff but is helpless
[15:24:35] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:24:37] <robertmaxrees> you can'
[15:24:59] <robertmaxrees> *you can't fix it from your side - the server you're calling is in control.
[15:25:47] <jjrabbit> aaaand that's why CORS exists
[15:26:27] <AleDev> when y change the header the error is "provisional headers are shown"
[15:26:42] <robertmaxrees> AleDev that has nothing to do with your error :)
[15:27:20] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of - it's because the request is never completed.
[15:27:24] <robertmaxrees> so the headers are irrelevant.
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> you can'
[15:27:42] <robertmaxrees> *you can't fix the issue from your side at all.  the server has to allow you to do ajax calls from another domain
[15:28:03] <robertmaxrees> i could look to see if that service offers a public API endpoint or JSONP or something
[15:28:15] <robertmaxrees> Otherwise, you'll need to create a proxy on your webserver and use that.
[15:28:52] <AleDev> I thought if I could do a kind of proxy run in background that may handle the header
[15:29:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:29:10] <AleDev> build on client
[15:29:19] <robertmaxrees> no - you cannot fix this from the client.
[15:29:30] <robertmaxrees> it would have to be via your server.
[15:31:01] <AleDev> it would be interesting understand how work the chrome extension that allow cors
[15:31:33] <AleDev> a kind of reverse engineering
[15:31:35] <robertmaxrees> that's changing browser settings that remove that restriction.  but that is not something you can do with in-page javascript.
[15:31:54] <robertmaxrees> CORS is a very important sercurity feature.
[15:33:09] <AleDev> I thought to make in java for andriod an extension of webview component that may have disable that part of security
[15:33:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of work to circumvent CORS.
[15:33:41] <robertmaxrees> what's the API you're hitting?
[15:33:44] <AleDev> that could be a way
[15:34:40] <AleDev> is about ATM cash avaibility in real time
[15:34:45] <robertmaxrees> !
[15:34:46] <robertmaxrees> woah
[15:35:23] <robertmaxrees> what other information is available from that APIO?
[15:35:26] <robertmaxrees> *API
[15:35:35] <AleDev> there many apps that show atm location but not all that have cash rightnow
[15:36:06] <AleDev> only apply to my country Uruguay
[15:36:31] <robertmaxrees> there's likely a very good reason they're not allowing 3rd party API calls.
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> at least not from the client.
[15:36:50] <AleDev> aha that the point
[15:37:10] <jjrabbit> robert you know a lot about webdev, do you know how i can animate an element around a page using javascript to update its coordinates?
[15:37:24] <robertmaxrees> jjrabbit there are a few ways to do that.
[15:37:29] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[15:38:12] <AleDev> the forget to ofuscate the code and I trick the code to simplied dropdown
[15:38:22] <robertmaxrees> AleDev that's not a good idea.
[15:38:33] <robertmaxrees> AleDev so they basically don't want you to hit their api.
[15:38:40] <robertmaxrees> which means you shouldn't.
[15:39:27] <jjrabbit> i want an element to move up or down on the screen (via animation) when i update its coordinates
[15:39:46] <robertmaxrees> so where are you stuck?
[15:39:48] <AleDev> only get the names and in a minimalist style of the places working
[15:39:59] <jjrabbit> ideally i want it to always have an "animation" property, and i simply supply the new y coordinate
[15:40:09] <robertmaxrees> AleDev doesn't matter heh.  they don't want you hitting the api - they're actively trying to stop you from doing it.
[15:40:35] <robertmaxrees> jjrabbit that's a simple function.
[15:41:12] <jjrabbit> i think i'm doing it wrong though, i'm trying to add/remove classes on it but its acting janky
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[15:41:27] <robertmaxrees> share a fiddle out to the room :)
[15:41:29] <jjrabbit> ok don't laugh though
[15:41:35] <jjrabbit> https://jsfiddle.net/47qaL0v2/
[15:41:56] <robertmaxrees> okay so back up.
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> you just want it to go up or down?
[15:42:26] <jjrabbit> i want the up button to increment y pixels, and down button to decrement y pixels
[15:42:29] <robertmaxrees> and what should happen if you press, say , "down" twice"
[15:42:38] <robertmaxrees> *"down" twice
[15:42:49] <jjrabbit> it goes an extra 50 pixels down
[15:42:54] <jjrabbit> but animated
[15:43:04] <AleDev> ok thanks for help me understand why something dont work
[15:43:07] <AleDev> by by
[15:43:25] <jjrabbit> see you in the next oceans 11 movie
[15:43:27] <jjrabbit> aw
[15:43:56] <jjrabbit> jk
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> okay so there are a few things to consider here.
[15:45:23] <robertmaxrees> 1: what kind of browser support are you hoping for?
[15:46:07] <jjrabbit> chrome + safari
[15:46:30] <jjrabbit> ie is dead to me
[15:46:40] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be but alright lol
[15:46:47] <robertmaxrees> unless your analytics say otherwise.
[15:47:03] <jjrabbit> they seem to agree
[15:48:01] <jjrabbit> did you hear even edge is going to use chrome's engine
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> not just the engine, but yes.
[15:48:20] <robertmaxrees> which is too bad, really.
[15:48:21] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[15:48:23] <jjrabbit> even the microsoft devs know they suck
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:48:35] <robertmaxrees> that's not why they're switching.
[15:48:46] <robertmaxrees> the industry has some endemic issues and they're not willing to fight against them any more.
[15:48:50] <robertmaxrees> either way
[15:48:56] <jjrabbit> hmm cool
[15:49:13] <jjrabbit> i heard it's because devs aren't willing to make their apps work on edge
[15:49:20] <jjrabbit> or just don't care
[15:49:42] <robertmaxrees> because many devs are too used to the bugs present in chrome ;)
[15:49:54] <robertmaxrees> so ANYWAY - part of your issue is that you're setting static values.
[15:50:04] <jjrabbit> yes
[15:50:18] <robertmaxrees> the super simple way to do this would be with jquery's animate./
[15:50:20] <jjrabbit> so would i make a global variable for that or something else
[15:50:36] <robertmaxrees> and then read the value, add 50 or w/e, and animate from there.
[15:50:41] <jjrabbit> i was hoping to start using native CSS for this
[15:51:05] <robertmaxrees> basically the same story, then.
[15:51:33] <jjrabbit> so would i read its current y coordinate?
[15:51:42] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> you read the current y, add 50 to it, then setting with the new one.
[15:51:56] <jjrabbit> .position() ?
[15:52:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm super rustty with css animations for stuff like this.
[15:52:33] <jjrabbit> oh
[15:52:43] <robertmaxrees> but experiment around.
[15:52:47] <jjrabbit> but you would use the jquery method right?
[15:52:55] <robertmaxrees> also you shouldn't need to keep adding/removing the moveItem class.
[15:52:56] <robertmaxrees> that seems odd.
[15:53:00] <jjrabbit> yea
[15:53:06] <jjrabbit> that's the part that's screwy
[15:53:27] <jjrabbit> that's what all the examples used and i wasn't sure what class to give it otherwise
[15:55:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out https://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/css-animation/ for some basics on css animations
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> should be some valuable info int here.
[15:55:29] <jjrabbit> is that john resig's blog
[15:55:46] <jjrabbit> just joking heh
[15:55:49] <robertmaxrees> ??
[15:55:51] <jjrabbit> lol
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> HUH?
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> *huh
[15:56:18] <jjrabbit> the japanese glyphs made me think of his js ninja book
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:56:42] <jjrabbit> seems like something he would put on his page
[15:57:59] <robertmaxrees> https://johnresig.com/ his site's a little more spartan ;)
[15:59:03] <jjrabbit> his work speaks for itself
[15:59:11] <jjrabbit> random question, have you ever met john
[15:59:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:59:23] <robertmaxrees> he's not involved with jquery any more.
[15:59:31] <jjrabbit> not even code review?
[15:59:49] <robertmaxrees> he handed the project over years ago.
[15:59:58] <jjrabbit> to who
[16:00:07] <robertmaxrees> the jQuery foundation.
[16:00:14] <robertmaxrees> who then got folded into the JS Foundation.
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[16:00:23] <jjrabbit> just wondering
[16:00:32] <jjrabbit> since i like the library and use it i like to keep track
[16:00:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:00:51] <jjrabbit> basic info i should know i guess lol
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> https://blog.jquery.com/2012/03/06/announcing-the-jquery-foundation/ for some info about the transition
[16:02:41] <jjrabbit> damn
[16:02:43] <jjrabbit> that was in 2012?
[16:02:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> been a while.
[16:17:20] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: so i can get it to move but i'm not sure how to animate it
[16:17:22] <jjrabbit> https://jsfiddle.net/05kjn7Lw/
[16:17:47] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't store var currentY = $('#myItem').position().top; in a global var wiw.,
[16:17:54] <robertmaxrees> *global var fwiw
[16:18:03] <jjrabbit> yea that's hacky
[16:18:26] <jjrabbit> this is just a proof of concept :)
[16:18:43] <jjrabbit> (famous last words hahaha)
[16:19:46] <jjrabbit> aaaand it's in production
[16:22:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3ufmb2dk/1/
[16:23:33] <jjrabbit> i wish transform: translateY(): took a "current-coordinate" paramater
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean so you could set an offset?
[16:24:15] <jjrabbit> no i thought it's cause i needed it
[16:24:18] <jjrabbit> but yours works without it
[16:24:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:24:38] <jjrabbit> how come you don't need keyframes for this
[16:24:44] <robertmaxrees> because you don't?
[16:24:45] <robertmaxrees> you'
[16:24:49] <jjrabbit> lol
[16:24:50] <robertmaxrees> *you aren't doing anything complicated.
[16:24:59] <robertmaxrees> you just want to aniamte when a particular property changes.
[16:25:08] <jjrabbit> ok so "animation" is for a fancy animation
[16:25:08] <robertmaxrees> and it's a simple animation
[16:25:15] <jjrabbit> "transition" is for simple movements?
[16:25:20] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[16:25:34] <jjrabbit> this whole time i was saying animation but i wanted a transition
[16:25:36] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: ty!
[16:25:46] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20586143/css-animation-vs-transition
[16:26:28] <jjrabbit> never gets easier
[16:26:30] <jjrabbit> lol
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:27:22] <jjrabbit> exactly my issue thanks
[16:28:13] <jjrabbit> when you click the up/down arrows really fast it gets a little glitchy
[16:28:20] <jjrabbit> do you know if there's a way to "queue" commands?
[16:28:39] <jjrabbit> is that a thing?
[16:29:17] <robertmaxrees> that gets to be a PITA in cases like this.
[16:29:24] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual use-case?
[16:30:00] <jjrabbit> i'm trying to do something like this lol
[16:30:07] <jjrabbit> https://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/
[16:30:29] <robertmaxrees> so....
[16:30:32] <jjrabbit> the filter effect is really nice
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> why not just use that?
[16:30:37] <jjrabbit> LOL
[16:30:42] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:30:47] <jjrabbit> i tried
[16:31:10] <jjrabbit> it doesn't really fit into my use case
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> so you want to recreate a masonry/shuffle style plugin?
[16:31:20] <robertmaxrees> i guess i don'
[16:31:21] <jjrabbit> see, i don't
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> *don't see how this is at all similar in that case.
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> what do you actually want to accomplish?
[16:31:47] <jjrabbit> i want THAT effect, but for a list style layout
[16:32:11] <jjrabbit> that plugin uses absolute positioning and screws everything up with how my app works
[16:32:32] <robertmaxrees> so the plugin DOES accomplish what you're looking for.
[16:32:37] <robertmaxrees> but you ran into issues with it?
[16:33:01] <jjrabbit> it does to a degree, but it also forces some compromises that i'm not willing to make
[16:33:14] <jjrabbit> like not working in li
[16:33:18] <jjrabbit> list items
[16:33:35] <jjrabbit> which is my current layout
[16:33:45] <jjrabbit> i mean it works in a li but it removes the numbers
[16:34:43] <jjrabbit> it has some quirks that instead of wasting my time figuring out how to workaround i thought i could save time but just making my own implementation
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:55] <jjrabbit> i know lol
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> you're gonna spend much more time doing that.
[16:35:05] <jjrabbit> well
[16:35:14] <jjrabbit> if i wanted all the functionality of this plugin then you'd be correct
[16:35:37] <jjrabbit> but the effects this guy uses are just CSS transitions
[16:35:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:35:47] <robertmaxrees> famous last words :)
[16:35:58] <jjrabbit> gotta learn sometime!
[16:36:12] <robertmaxrees> the transitions aren't going to be the hard part imo.
[16:36:23] <robertmaxrees> it's the logic to determine where to position things that is.
[16:36:33] <jjrabbit> if i was doing a grid style i would agree
[16:36:55] <jjrabbit> but like i said since i'm doing list items i feel much more confident about it
[16:39:51] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: anyway thanks robert udaman
[16:40:10] <robertmaxrees> sure

[16:45:02] <toaderas> Hello, I am trying to do an animate to gradually increase the padding-top, if !important can't be used with it, any other ways?
[16:45:10] <toaderas> to ensure that padding gets applied
[16:45:14] <toaderas> regardless of other styles
[16:45:35] <robertmaxrees> toaderas how are you setting the padding-top??
[16:45:43] <robertmaxrees> can you share out a fiddle of your code?
[16:45:50] <toaderas> robertmaxrees: this._parentElement.animate( { "padding-top": "50" }, 400);
[16:45:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:46:06] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle?
[16:46:45] <gambl0r3> hey robert, hows going?

[16:57:09] <gambl0r3> congratulations
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> anyway!
[16:57:53] <jjrabbit> anyway jquery is still the best js library in 2019 !!
[16:57:58] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:58:10] <robertmaxrees> dunno if I'
[16:58:16] <robertmaxrees> *i'd say "best"
[17:00:19] <jjrabbit> longest running?
[17:00:25] <jjrabbit> still number on!!
[17:00:29] <jjrabbit> one
[17:00:32] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:00:41] <gambl0r3> jjrabbit, what are you even talking about?
[17:00:53] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> jjrabbit that's an interesting question though/
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder what the oldest, actively maintained libraries are for JS.
[17:04:08] <robertmaxrees> with some kind of solid userbase.
[17:13:27] <AlbertoP> is there a simple way to allow scientific notation for double values?
[17:13:56] <robertmaxrees> "allow" where?
[17:14:26] <AlbertoP> sorry, I rephrased and removed a piece :\
[17:14:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:14:35] <AlbertoP> in jquery-validation
[17:14:53] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[17:15:10] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you're talking about still :|
[17:15:49] <AlbertoP> so, I am using asp.net core, which does client-side validation with the jquery unobtrusive plugin
[17:16:06] <AlbertoP> I ask for a value in the double.MinValue - double.MaxValue range...
[17:16:20] <AlbertoP> the default value is set in scientific notation: 1e-6
[17:16:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.  so really, you want to accept scientific notation for numbers so you can compare.
[17:17:08] <AlbertoP> the range is fixed correctly in the generated html (data-val-range looks good)
[17:17:20] <AlbertoP> but yes, that's what I'd need
[17:17:23] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27151311/how-to-use-scientific-notation-in-js
[17:17:55] <AlbertoP> uhm that's not my issue...
[17:18:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> you need to write a custom validator
[17:18:32] <robertmaxrees> rather, custom rule
[17:18:56] <AlbertoP> ok
[17:19:04] <AlbertoP> I'll dig
[17:19:31] <AlbertoP> seems odd it's not default though... it's a pretty common need, I'd say
[17:20:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue it's not that common.
[17:20:28] <AlbertoP> uhm
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> probably pretty contextual to the industry you work in though.
[17:20:58] <AlbertoP> I guess the web world doesn't use that much (maybe)
[17:21:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[17:22:20] <AlbertoP> well... even the calculator you find at the grocery store can do that ;-)
[17:22:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:22:56] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there's a good reason for that.
[17:23:10] <AlbertoP> which would be?
[17:23:22] <robertmaxrees> computers are terrible at math.
[17:23:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:23:30] <AlbertoP> lol
[17:23:58] <robertmaxrees> exhibit 1: ertoP
[17:24:04] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[17:24:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z61tvhfk/1/
[17:24:40] <AlbertoP> hehe well my actual job is being a computational scientist, so I am unfortunately well aware of that :P
[17:25:05] <robertmaxrees> also: interesting that you're not just ajaxing the form to your backend to validate instead.
[17:25:16] <AlbertoP> trying to learn some web tech for an idea I have... it's been a rocky road so far :)
[17:25:32] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:27:22] <AlbertoP> it's a simple form, with server and client-side validation. In asp.net, if you use data annotations, they automatically apply the corresponding client-side validation via jquery... the downside is that they don't do it so well! :P
[17:28:13] <jjrabbit> robertmaxrees: yea there's gotta be a site that tracks that. when everybody starts using npm they'll probably have pretty good data on it
[17:28:23] <AlbertoP> so you end up with a form that shows the user, say 3.2e-2... the user does not change it, submits, and gets a validation error LOL
[17:28:28] <jjrabbit> anyway talk to you later
[17:28:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean, basically everybody IS using NPM at this point so lol
[17:28:34] <robertmaxrees> enjoy
[17:28:51] <robertmaxrees> AlbertoP hah, bummer
[17:29:13] <jjrabbit> hah yea so they probably have pretty good stats
[17:31:14] <robertmaxrees> my brain is going numb from unit testing.
[17:31:15] <robertmaxrees> jeeeeze
[21:52:52] <jjrabbit> robert you still up?
