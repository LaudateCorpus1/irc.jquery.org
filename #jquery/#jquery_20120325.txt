[00:14:36] <jrockjiggz> AbstractAce: ever finish your lightbox?
[00:18:09] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, yes
[00:18:11] <AbstractAce> long time ago ;)
[00:19:03] <jrockjiggz> can i see it?
[00:19:25] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, like a demo? or a screenshot
[00:19:30] <AbstractAce> i can try the latter, im on dialup at the moment
[00:20:30] <jrockjiggz> wow sorry to hear that
[00:20:43] <jrockjiggz> just wanted to see the code
[00:21:02] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, its pretty simple, i will share it with you once i get my broadband back :)
[00:21:19] <AbstractAce> irc and imgur is as far as i can go on this dialup
[00:22:06] <jrockjiggz> no worries
[00:22:48] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, do you want to see how it looks
[00:24:26] <jrockjiggz> sure!
[00:33:08] <AbstractAce> man i am pissed jrockjiggz
[00:33:14] <AbstractAce> the problem ive been racking my brains over for 2 days
[00:33:17] <AbstractAce> was right there in front of me
[00:33:18] <AbstractAce> :|
[00:34:52] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, http://i.imgur.com/WfPTQ.png
[00:35:13] <AbstractAce> the design is messed up a bit, and you might not feel like its a lightbox but thats because i selected the lightbox for screenshot
[00:35:49] <AbstractAce> wait ill upload a better picture
[00:36:34] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, here http://i.imgur.com/rdQze.png
[00:38:27] <jrockjiggz> cool, i wanted to see how you approached it
[00:39:08] <jrockjiggz> i've got an old lightbox running on my site, and i want a new one, i'm looking at ready-made solutions, but a lot of it is bloat
[00:39:38] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, you can try shadowbox, it is what i used at first but i wanted to add this feature where people can like and dislike the picture
[00:39:42] <AbstractAce> and view comments and so on
[00:39:44] <AbstractAce> so yeah i made my own
[00:40:48] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, http://notey.it/n/Nnc i have to work more on the image resolution problems but i'll get there ;)
[00:42:41] <jrockjiggz> are your data coming from attributes? data-width="600" data-poster="somwthing" ?
[00:43:17] <jrockjiggz> hmm ok
[00:57:52] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, yes, and the data attributes have values echoed using php from the database
[00:57:55] <raj`> yo
[00:58:29] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, you should have lightbox_2 or whatever number statusid var is in the dom already
[00:58:36] <AbstractAce> and hide it using display: none; or .hide in jquery
[00:58:38] <AbstractAce> i did the latter
[00:59:11] <jrockjiggz> yes i have it in the dom, and show/hide it and load ajax when called upon
[00:59:42] <AbstractAce> why ajax?
[01:00:04] <AbstractAce> i used the data-attributes because that would be faster and less server hammering :)
[01:00:15] <raj> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s89FLmDTFI
[01:00:50] <AbstractAce> these average users dont know the trouble we go through to give them a good interface, they flame at the first thing they find wrong.
[01:00:57] <AbstractAce> until they get used to it.
[01:07:19] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, you will not add this class to your css, and toggle it on trigger of lightbox.. "modalOverlay'
[01:07:21] <AbstractAce> it disables the bg
[01:08:17] <systemfault> wtf... shit rap made by some low-life piece of shit :#
[01:44:02] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know how to setup jquery validate to use remote with multiple responses?
[01:44:15] <jrockjiggz> multiple different results
[01:50:07] <AbstractAce> jrockjiggz, explain your question a bit more maybe with an example too
[02:38:27] <tman> im trying to understand .when().. i have an element that's using .load and then in another function i'm trying to execute it when the load is completed and i thought i could use $.when($(".wrapper.productsContainer")).then(function() {
[02:38:30] <tman> but it's failing...
[02:39:53] <tman> oh nevermind it is working..
[02:40:03] <tman> :)
[02:42:09] <BlaDe^> hi guys... I have a <div> with a bunch of images is.. I want to use a jQuery UI slider to adjust the size of the images... how would I go about doing it nicely?
[02:48:33] <gloomer> BlaDe^
[02:48:45] <gloomer> probably use css to scale images, and modify the css with the jquery slider
[02:55:26] <BlaDe^> gloomer: ok i'll look at that
[03:01:17] <BlaDe^> thanks
[03:05:08] <tman> $(".button1").attr('href') <- produces "listing.php?id=52"
[03:05:17] <gloomer> did that  work for ya Bladez
[03:05:21] <tman> so how come parseInt($(".button1").attr('href')) return NaN ?
[03:05:32] <tman> shouldn't it return 52?
[03:06:23] <gloomer> no
[03:08:31] <tman> gloomer how come?
[03:08:40] <tman> parseInt docs say it accepts a string
[03:08:54] <tman> or..
[03:09:02] <tman> do i have to store that in a variable
[03:09:06] <tman> i thinks taht problem
[03:11:55] <tman> hmm nope wtf
[03:19:09] <tman> nm i got it
[03:19:17] <tman> has to be on it's own
[03:20:51] <wumpus_> hello guys
[03:21:05] <wumpus_> what's wrong in this? .addClass('success').delay(1000).removeClass('success')
[03:21:22] <wumpus_> success class get removed istant
[03:21:29] <wumpus_> ignoring delay
[03:24:04] <wumpus_> is better to use a setTimeout?
[03:25:06] <tman> urlStr.substring(15)
[03:25:10] <tman> there we go
[03:27:17] <Kit-10> ?.delay
[03:27:17] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[03:27:37] <Kit-10> wumpus_ i don't think delay will help you here
[03:27:55] <gloomer> tman sorry
[03:28:02] <Kit-10> since .delay is only for queued items and addClass/removeClass are not queued
[03:28:03] <gloomer> its because it takes a string of numbers only
[03:28:09] <gloomer> your passing a string of numbers plus text
[03:28:29] <wumpus_> i should add something like this .queue(function() {$(this).removeClass()}); ?
[03:28:38] <Kit-10> nope
[03:28:42] <Kit-10> just do as you said
[03:28:47] <Kit-10> use setTimeout
[03:28:49] <wumpus_> ok
[03:29:27] <Kit-10> wumpus_ store your item in a var
[03:29:37] <Kit-10> then use that var in the function passed to setTimeout
[03:29:54] <wumpus_> ok
[03:30:44] <Kit-10> eg var myitem = $(selector).addClass('x');  setTimeout(function() { myitem.removeClass('x'); }, 5000);
[03:32:08] <wumpus_> yeah got it, thank you
[04:16:07] <jrockjiggz> is there a way to select EL that is not display: inline;
[04:16:36] <jrockjiggz> or :has( css({ display: "block"}) ..
[04:17:30] <jrockjiggz> hmm nm
[04:19:27] <K3|Chris> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:19:43] <K3|Chris> $('div.left').css('float'); gives you left/right/none
[04:20:33] <Advocated> If ive got lots of auto completes sending off to a php file, is it a bad idea to have on my inputs, things like data-table_name data-field_name so i can make one auto complete which choses which table to use and therefore which field too?
[04:24:42] <aqeel> hi room
[04:25:08] <RiggsFolly> Hi, Is there anyone familiar with TableSorter? Especially the trigger('update') amd .trigger('sorton',sorting) mechanisms.
[04:25:25] <aqeel> any know of good site where i can make use of rgba in older browser......may be htc hack?
[04:25:58] <RiggsFolly> I am getting a o is undefined from the UpdateHeaderSortCount method and I cannot see why
[04:26:34] <K3|Chris> aqeel: a fallback to a normal solid color is usually the way I do it
[04:27:14] <aqeel> well agreed but if javascript is enabled then that is a good way to apply in old browsers
[04:27:23] <K3|Chris> aqeel: only in IE 6-8 btw
[04:27:28] <aqeel> yes
[04:27:39] <aqeel> i al targeting those breowsers...
[04:27:41] <aqeel> am*
[04:28:00] <K3|Chris> I just use regular old CSS to do this, first define the #/rgb color, then the RGBA
[04:28:15] <K3|Chris> IE6-8 sees the first and applies it, ignores the second, new browsers applies the second
[04:28:22] <Woet> aqeel: why are you targeting IE6?
[04:28:33] <aqeel> but if javascript is enabled then no harm done if they can see the effect as well
[04:28:37] <K3|Chris> Woet: cuthulu told him to
[04:28:55] <K3|Chris> *cthulhu
[04:29:04] <aqeel> well not ie 6 but it uses same filter as 7
[04:29:09] <Woet> aqeel: why are you targeting IE7?
[04:29:16] <aqeel> so 6-8 is in one boat
[04:29:53] <aqeel> well 6,7,8 have saame filter but slight difference then why not apply for it if can work out
[04:37:02] <aqeel> so please any
[04:37:13] <aqeel> source for rgba for older browsers...
[04:40:09] <K3|Chris> http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/
[04:40:13] <K3|Chris> bottom of that post
[04:40:30] <K3|Chris> "filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000050,endColorstr=#99000050);"
[04:40:38] <K3|Chris> I'd guess that's HEXA
[04:42:04] <aqeel> i saw that site,.....i am looking for short hand something like css3pie.com
[04:42:10] <aqeel> some htc if possible
[04:42:38] <aqeel> i came across one site but forgot to bookmark nd now am in the open wild again
[04:43:04] <aqeel> it is #AARRGGBB...
[04:43:14] <aqeel> alpha,reb,blue,green
[04:43:44] <aqeel> thanks for taaking some time for me
[04:44:18] <aqeel> well am still searching too
[05:06:22] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> I want something like this
[05:06:22] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> http://jsbin.com/uwewi/
[05:06:29] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> But this is my code

[05:06:46] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> I can't do it properly
[05:07:32] <gloomer> let me see
[05:13:43] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> gloomer?
[05:13:50] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> No chance?
[05:14:00] <gloomer> ya i can fix it
[05:14:03] <gloomer> just the checkboxes?
[05:14:05] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> yeeyyyy
[05:14:11] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> yeah yeah yeahs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[05:16:35] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> yes! I have no problem with the jquery... It will go handy right?
[05:16:41] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> Pretty please :)
[05:17:24] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> *ajax
[05:19:07] <gloomer> sure
[05:23:35] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> gloomer, I'm kinda running out of battery? Mind asking a favor?
[05:23:50] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/5mpry/
[05:24:07] <gloomer> im sure you can clean it up
[05:24:47] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> got it
[05:24:49] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> thanks!
[05:25:47] <gloomer> notice i changed the classes slightly as well

[05:27:32] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> Thanks! x 10000000000000
[05:27:50] <gloomer> just remember radio buttons :)
[05:27:52] <gloomer> they are made for that
[05:27:59] <gloomer> checkboxes are better for yes/no
[05:29:46] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> IKR so I will just change it
[05:29:48] <yeah_yeah_yeahs> :)
[05:37:32] <lenswipe> dabear_, poke
[05:49:58] <jakoch> does anyone know a decent jquery plugin supporting websocket stuff?
[05:50:53] <aqeel> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-websocket/
[05:51:33] <jakoch> thx!!
[05:51:35] <sean`> JakeSays, why not use socket.io
[05:54:46] <lenswipe> sean`, aqeel, got a minute to look at something?
[05:55:01] <lenswipe> http://95.146.93.86/prismvc/bookings/add
[05:55:03] <sean`> be careful what you wish for
[05:55:07] <lenswipe> lol
[05:55:18] <lenswipe> see on that page?
[05:55:31] <lenswipe> i have a big where people can choose a user and then "add" them using the "add lecturer button"
[05:55:51] <sean`> add participant
[05:55:54] <lenswipe> yeah that
[05:56:00] <sean`> we can add php errors
[05:56:01] <sean`> awes
[05:56:05] <lenswipe> yeah X
[05:56:06] <lenswipe> XD
[05:56:12] <lenswipe> im handling the onclick of the button, the creation of the new element, the checking to make sure they can only add someone once etc etc
[05:56:19] <lenswipe> it occurs to me that thats a bit clunky
[05:56:19] <sean`> okay
[05:56:24] <sean`> minute is over
[05:56:28] <lenswipe> would i be better using a js framework for that?
[05:56:41] <lenswipe> and if so which one
[05:56:51] <lenswipe> i was looking at sproutcore but im not sure if it does what i need
[05:57:01] <sean`> well
[05:57:07] <sean`> frameworks are really koole
[05:57:14] <sean`> and will help you do your things efficiently
[05:57:19] <lenswipe> right now im just using jquery and im writing a lot of code for very little funtionality
[05:57:20] <sean`> but you don't always need them
[05:57:41] <lenswipe> on the other hand if im learning how to use a framework and then find two weeks later it doesnt do what i need then im kind of wasting my time
[05:57:42] <sean`> if you feel you should, then you should try at least
[05:57:44] <sean`> see how it goes
[05:58:04] <lenswipe> well im looking for a framework that would do that well with very little code, can you recommend one?
[05:58:44] <aqeel> layout what are your requirements ......what is your dsesign.....and then gor for what u want.....framework or individual code
[05:58:59] <lenswipe> huh?
[05:59:27] <aqeel> well framework is predefined stuff
[05:59:28] <lenswipe> i want something that will let me do what ive just described with less code and is supported by IE, FF and Chrome
[05:59:34] <sean`> lenswipe, backbone is pretty awes
[05:59:37] <sean`> but there are a lot
[05:59:45] <sean`> lenswipe, google todomvc by addyosmani
[05:59:53] <lenswipe> ok
[05:59:56] <sean`> it's a todo app built in differetn frameworks
[06:00:09] <sean`> and it will help you fidn the one that fits your patterns
[06:00:15] <gloomer> lenswipe no matter how you go about it your going to write alot of code unless your doing it all the time
[06:00:24] <sean`> they're all good, it's just about what fits
[06:00:38] <aqeel> your goal and requirements that is
[06:00:42] <lenswipe> ok
[06:01:03] <lenswipe> i was looking at sproutcore
[06:01:50] <sean`> todomvc
[06:01:55] <lenswipe> ok
[06:05:42] <lenswipe> is it possible to only use say ember.js in one of my views?
[06:08:51] <lenswipe> sean`, wonder if you can help with something else
[06:09:55] <sean`> ?ask @ lenswipe
[06:09:56] <bot-t> lenswipe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:10:07] <lenswipe> sean`, do you still have my app open?
[06:10:09] <lenswipe> if not open it again
[06:10:11] <lenswipe> youll notice that
[06:10:13] <lenswipe> err*
[06:10:28] <lenswipe> youll notice that when you add someone, the buttons dont work on their div
[06:10:35] <lenswipe> however the one that comes with the page does have working buttons
[06:10:37] <lenswipe> any ideas?
[06:14:12] <johnkpaul> lenswipe: I don't know the specifics, but perhaps take a look at
[06:14:15] <johnkpaul> ?live @lenswipe
[06:14:15] <bot-t> lenswipe, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[06:14:28] <johnkpaul> and then, since live is deprecated, use
[06:14:31] <lenswipe> johnkpaul, ?
[06:14:33] <johnkpaul> ?on lenswipe
[06:14:34] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Couldn't find "on lenswipe" in jQuery Docs.
[06:14:39] <johnkpaul> ?on @lenswipe
[06:14:39] <bot-t> lenswipe, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:14:44] <lenswipe> but why does the other one work?!
[06:14:55] <lenswipe> the one i create on pageload works, but the one i create using jqueyr doesnt
[06:14:57] <lenswipe> jquery*
[06:14:58] <lenswipe> O_O
[06:15:05] <johnkpaul> because event handlers are bound to specific elements
[06:15:12] <johnkpaul> if they are new elements, the event handlers aren't there
[06:15:19] <johnkpaul> you need to add them again
[06:15:27] <lenswipe> but surely bootstrap takes care of that
[06:15:27] <johnkpaul> you can unbind/bind to all again
[06:15:31] <johnkpaul> or you can use live/on
[06:15:34] <johnkpaul> bootstrap?
[06:15:35] <lenswipe> i see
[06:15:37] <lenswipe> yeah
[06:15:39] <johnkpaul> this is a jquery question, no?
[06:15:39] <lenswipe> bootstrap.js
[06:15:41] <johnkpaul> what bootstrap?
[06:15:46] <lenswipe> hang on
[06:15:47] <johnkpaul> :/ sorry, I was only there for your last sentence
[06:15:51] <lenswipe> its k
[06:15:55] <lenswipe> im using bootstrap frontend framework
[06:16:05] <lenswipe> twitter bootstrap
[06:16:09] <lenswipe> which uses jquery
[06:16:33] <johnkpaul> hm, bootstrap is just a set of wigets when it comes to js
[06:16:39] <johnkpaul> it's not a "Framework" in the traditional sense
[06:16:40] <lenswipe> right
[06:16:43] <lenswipe> ok
[06:16:47] <johnkpaul> so no, I doubt it takes care of that for you
[06:16:51] <johnkpaul> it just has some plugins OOTBN
[06:16:53] <johnkpaul> OOTB*
[06:16:59] <lenswipe> ok
[06:17:08] <johnkpaul> anyway, read through the .live() documentation
[06:17:14] <lenswipe> but what i mean is
[06:17:16] <johnkpaul> and then when you undertand it, read through the .on() docs
[06:17:22] <lenswipe> the first one works but the second one doesnt
[06:17:25] <lenswipe> err the other ones*
[06:17:31] <lenswipe> so i need to re-bind them to event handlers
[06:17:37] <johnkpaul> yes
[06:17:49] <johnkpaul> they were never bound in the first place, becaue they are new elements
[06:17:55] <lenswipe> how well do you think twitter bootstrap would work with something like ember,js?
[06:18:00] <johnkpaul> gotta go, ask questions if you have them
[06:18:06] <lenswipe> damn
[06:18:13] <lenswipe> sean`, ?
[06:32:19] <tash> out of curiosity, I have a modal form that doesn't auto open when the page is loaded. It opens when I click on a button. So, does that mean that the input elements' in that modal can't be retrieved by $("#id").val();  since the form isn't loaded until the button is presses...e.g. after the DOM loads?
[06:32:59] <tash> i meant, input elements' values ^
[06:33:29] <tash> I'm trying to pass the input elements' values through .get, but they are empty =\
[06:36:30] <coppa> okay at last I uploaded my projects to git https://github.com/binarymind/Magic-jQuery/ and https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-navigate
[06:42:34] <clu3> is there a simple plugin that makes my table sortable? what i don't like about tablesorter is it really changes the style of my existing table
[06:43:56] <coppa> clu3: i personaly use this one http://www.datatables.net/
[06:44:03] <coppa> don't know if good for you
[06:44:09] <asher^> jquery ui sortable?
[06:44:20] <clu3> thanks coppa, i'll have a look
[06:44:26] <clu3> asher^, it changes my css
[06:45:00] <asher^> you can modify that though
[06:45:29] <asher^> oh, do you want it sortable like drag-drop, or like click header?
[06:45:35] <clu3> yep, but i'm not good at css so that's a real pain for me
[06:45:39] <clu3> asher^, just lick the header
[06:45:42] <asher^> ah ok
[06:45:44] <clu3> *click
[06:46:45] <tash> can anyone help me with getting the value of some input elements in a modal form?
[06:46:49] <tash> sorry if you saw the question already
[06:49:03] <shamess> tash: if the form is just hidden, you should still be able to do $().val() on them. If the form isn't even in the dom yet, then you obviously can't get a val from it... Unless i'm misunderstanding what you're saying?
[06:49:27] <tash> let me check really quick
[06:52:40] <tash> shamess: yeah, it isn't loaded in the dom when the pae loads...$("#dialog-form").dialog( { autoOpen: false ....
[06:53:29] <tash> so, as you can see it isn't there automatically ... I'm doing a .click on a button, and when that button is clicked, the modal form is then opened and has several input elements in it.  I need those values somehow...how?
[06:54:14] <shamess> Once those input elements are in the dom, you should be able to access them normally with $('#id').val()
[06:54:41] <shamess> Check that you're typing the ID correctly, and that the input has the correct ID, and that you're not trying to grab the data before they're in the DOM.
[07:01:49] <tash> shamess: that's what I think is the problem...when I load the page and view source, the form doesn't exist...it doesn't until I click on a button that says "Add New Schedule" and that hooks into the modal script and opens the modal form.
[07:03:15] <shamess> So don't do the $.get till you know the form is there (but won't it just be empty anyway?)
[07:03:56] <tash> may be easier to see now: http://pastie.org/3666011
[07:03:57] <Fiveways> I have a simple form with a checkbox(billing address same as shipping address?) that hides a few address fields when checked and shows them when its unchecked -- https://gist.github.com/2194671
[07:04:42] <tash> that <div> at the bottom, line 165 is the form that opens when the "addnew" button is clicked ... line 150
[07:04:43] <Fiveways> i've moved on to the page to edit the shipping info and the fields in this form get populated w/ data from the db
[07:04:59] <Fiveways> what would be the best way to show/hide that div without it clearing the data already in the form?
[07:05:51] <K3|Chris> visibility: hidden ?
[07:05:53] <tash> shamess: so for example, I'm trying to get the value of "jobdesc" by doing that get on line 132
[07:06:15] <K3|Chris> still renders the object, just doesn't show it
[07:06:21] <Fiveways> yeah
[07:06:21] <tash> ah! but my vars aren't there right now ... so yeah, where would I do something like var jobdesc = $("#jobdesc").val(); ?
[07:06:33] <Fiveways> I just didn't know if there was another way to change the behavior of the .toggle()
[07:06:48] <K3|Chris> .toggle does display: hidden I'm sure
[07:07:19] <Fiveways> thanks
[07:07:37] <AbstractAce> is there anyway i can disable scrolling
[07:07:48] <K3|Chris> overflow: hidden ?
[07:07:54] <shamess> tash: I'm not sure, but shouldn't your $.get() function be passing   jobnum: $('#jobnum').val()  ?
[07:08:18] <tash> lemme try
[07:09:17] <Fiveways> K3|Chris: so I should just have it check the checkbox state and toggle the visibility accordingly
[07:09:44] <AbstractAce> K3|Chris, doesn't that just hide the scrollbar, wouldn't it be still scrollable via the scroll mouse button
[07:10:01] <K3|Chris> AbstractAce: fairly sure you can't scroll
[07:10:24] <K3|Chris> Fiveways: don't know about your particular circumstance, but sure sounds good
[07:18:33] <tash> shamess: my get is fine if I pass it static values, but not when I try to pass it values from .val() :(
[07:37:29] <ChrisEar1> Hi, I was wondering if someone could please help me with the .on() method
[07:37:56] <ptriller> ChrisEar1, in what regarf ?
[07:38:03] <ChrisEar1> I have a line $(".class").on('click',function(){...});
[07:38:12] <ChrisEar1> which works great when the page loads
[07:38:33] <ChrisEar1> but if I then add additional items to the DOM after load with the class ".class", they do not inherit the click event
[07:38:44] <ChrisEar1> how would I achieve this?
[07:39:15] <asher^> .live
[07:39:32] <ChrisEar1> I thought .live was deprecated in favour of .on though?
[07:40:02] <asher^> oh, i didnt know
[07:40:07] <ptriller> live is deprecated
[07:40:38] <ptriller> ChrisEar1, well, but thats the always the crux with ajax dom replacement
[07:41:14] <asher^> $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);
[07:41:25] <ptriller> One way (the datepicker does that) is that it adds a css class to the elements that aready have the event bound and then wehen the dom is changed youc an select the new ones with a new selector
[07:41:44] <aqeel> try re invoking the code by placing after the page content loads...
[07:41:48] <ChrisEar1> is there a DOM changed event I can look for?
[07:43:21] <aqeel> function with on say function a(){....}....now after the content load function......load()......put function a().....thus reinvoking the function
[07:44:17] <ChrisEar1> I think that makes sense, thanks everyone :)
[07:45:46] <aqeel> chrisEar1.....
[07:45:58] <aqeel> may be you are placing the code order wrongly...
[07:47:19] <aqeel> make your load before the on and whenever content chnges the class will always be there\....
[07:57:49] <Raydiation> what am i doing wrong? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/571004/ the first input method gets called, the one inside the keyup gets never executed
[08:02:15] <Raydiation> aah, $(document) not $("document")
[08:06:30] <pneftali> hi guys - using the autocomplete ui, how can I catch the event when the call to ajax starts ?
[08:07:06] <pneftali> because i want to show a loader gif when it starts, and hides it after the response
[08:08:43] <AngryAngel> Hello
[08:09:05] <AngryAngel> http://moonlightmedia.tv/
[08:09:18] <AngryAngel> Why is the A-Z being displayed differently in Firefox/IE
[08:09:39] <AngryAngel> Firefox has all the correct properties but IE is just displayed some messy shit (excuse the language)
[08:10:00] <AngryAngel> If I hover above "A" and click on "A item" nothing happens in FireFox
[08:10:19] <AngryAngel> When I do it in IE, I get a message saying "A item was clicked"
[08:10:27] <asher^> is there an easy way to change the colour of a jquery ui button?
[08:10:32] <AngryAngel> But I don't have onClick:function in my code
[08:10:44] <AngryAngel> So what's going on
[08:11:42] <smares> cheers! when using $.ajax() within an object function, is there a better way to make the object available via this other than using a proxied function as success param?
[08:11:47] <poppiez> when doing this.$el.delegate(selector, eventName, method); how do you trigger the event? I can't get the delegate to fire when doing $('#myElem').trigger('click');
[08:14:20] <AngryAngel> Actually I did have the "onClick:function" so never mind
[08:14:23] <AngryAngel> Ignore what I wrote
[08:22:50] <StPiere> i have an jQuery object $el ... how can i select the first ul after $el ?
[08:23:32] <smares> is the ul inside el?
[08:23:37] <StPiere> no
[08:23:40] <StPiere> after it
[08:24:01] <StPiere> like <input type="text" /><ul class="errors"></ul>
[08:24:47] <StPiere> and $el is input node
[08:24:54] <smares> next()?
[08:25:10] <StPiere> like $el.next('ul') ?
[08:25:24] <smares> yes
[08:25:26] <StPiere> thanks
[08:35:58] <wroathe> I'm trying ot make a jquery plugin and I'm following some commonly used patterns in doing so. I see many people accept an options object literal and extract information about functionality from that...
[08:36:14] <wroathe> The other pattern I see is that most people return this.each(function()... in their plugins
[08:36:24] <wroathe> And do the business logic inside of that closure
[08:36:42] <wroathe> For some reason though my options parameter isn't accessible inside of that closure
[08:36:45] <smares> the return this.each is for chaining
[08:37:39] <smares> and what do you mean not accessible?
[08:37:47] <smares> are you accessing this.options or options?
[08:37:52] <smares> this is modified within the closure
[08:38:18] <wroathe> https://gist.github.com/f1992d3f8e508bf7d111
[08:39:47] <wroathe> And yeah. I figured that's why people were doing this.each
[08:39:58] <wroathe> But it's perplexing why my options would be undefined within that closure.
[08:44:21] <ptriller> Hi, Is it possible to have "inactive" entries in the autocompleter ? They should basically behave like the "disabled" option in a<select>
[08:44:46] <wroathe> And also this.options is an empty array for some reason...
[08:44:57] <wroathe> Inside of that closure
[08:45:11] <wroathe> The options I'm passing in look like { postponed: [3, 6, 9] }
[08:46:16] <wroathe> Omg
[08:46:22] <wroathe> var options is being hoisted
[08:46:28] <wroathe> Fucking javascript
[08:46:41] <wroathe> Not sure how I missed that before
[08:50:07] <Nomikos> I can see how that would be confusing, to say the least..
[08:56:54] <asher^> is there a way i can change the value of a dropdown menu with jquery in such a way that it triggers the actions that it would if a user changed it?
[08:58:18] <AngryAngel> http://moonlightmedia.tv/contact/
[08:58:19] <AngryAngel> http://moonlightmedia.tv/wallpapers/
[08:58:26] <AngryAngel> Can someone go to both of those pages
[08:58:31] <AngryAngel> Then hover on "A"
[08:58:40] <AngryAngel> And see if it gives you the same words/list
[09:05:06] <AngryAngel> http://moonlightmedia.tv http://moonlightmedia.tv/wallpapers/
[09:05:31] <AngryAngel> Why when you hover on "A" it's different in Chrome/IE (it's not being displayed properly)
[09:05:45] <AngryAngel> But when I hover on "A" with firefox everything is fine (displayed properly)
[09:06:31] <jonathansnook> asher^: Something like http://jsfiddle.net/7BCea/ perhaps. (although I feel like there's an easier way that would trigger the event automatically)
[09:08:43] <asher^> jonathanochs thanks
[09:14:46] <granden> Hi, I'm in the beginning of learning jquery and really like it. But I got a bit of problem.
[09:15:01] <granden> I'm following this serie of video guides, http://blog.themeforest.net/tutorials/jquery-for-absolute-beginners-day-13/
[09:15:08] <granden> and its the #13 I got problem with.
[09:15:26] <granden> My code can be found here, http://agfoto.se/jquery/lesson13.html
[09:15:42] <granden> and http://agfoto.se/jquery/submit_to_db.phps
[09:16:24] <granden> It is supposed to add those three fields to a database asynchronosly
[09:17:47] <ptriller> granden, add an error handoler to your ajax request, the server returns a 500 error
[09:18:51] <Pietertjepeter> hi
[09:18:59] <Pietertjepeter> how to get only the div ur on with hover ?
[09:19:07] <ptriller> $(this)
[09:19:22] <granden> ptriller: Hmm
[09:19:27] <ptriller> Pietertjepeter, thats always the element with the triggered event
[09:19:29] <granden> ok thanks.
[09:19:37] <Pietertjepeter> thanks
[09:19:48] <AngryAngel> Where's my answer :/
[09:19:57] <AngryAngel> I can't figure out this problem not even sure what to google for
[09:21:38] <ptriller> AngryAngel, Not sure what you mean, it looks the same on ff IE and Chrome here
[09:21:51] <granden> ptriller: Hmm, as I understand 500 is an error that the server can not handle my request. Looking at the code from the lesson it is pretty much exactly the same except I got my connection adress etc.
[09:21:51] <AngryAngel> ....It does?
[09:21:55] <AngryAngel> When you hover on "A"
[09:22:10] <AngryAngel> Go on /wallpapers/ or /contact/ with Chrome/IE
[09:22:13] <AngryAngel> Then hover
[09:22:21] <ptriller> there is a broad yellow div with "A item"
[09:22:26] <AngryAngel> Exactly
[09:22:28] <AngryAngel> "A item"
[09:22:31] <AngryAngel> Not "Awake" or "Awaken2"
[09:22:35] <AngryAngel> Why is the content different
[09:22:44] <AngryAngel> I would understand if the style was different
[09:23:03] <ptriller> yes, but its "A item" for all three browsers here
[09:23:09] <AngryAngel> ...It is?
[09:23:18] <AngryAngel> If I use Chrome
[09:23:24] <AngryAngel> And go on /Home/
[09:23:29] <AngryAngel> I see "Awake"
[09:23:37] <AngryAngel> When I go on /wallpapers/ I see "A item"
[09:23:44] <AngryAngel> When I go on /contact/ I see "Awake Awaken 2"
[09:23:59] <AngryAngel> Firefox = "Awake Awaken2" everywhere, all pages.
[09:24:04] <ptriller> Ahh, I used the wallpaper link
[09:24:06] <AngryAngel> IE = Chrome
[09:25:10] <AngryAngel> So ptriller, anything different?
[09:25:31] <AngryAngel> Or it's just "A item" all browsers/all pages?
[09:27:36] <AngryAngel> The best/worst part is that I downloaded Chrome AFTER I implemented everything
[09:27:45] <AngryAngel> So while I was using Chrome, no changes have been made
[09:27:59] <AngryAngel> So it's not a cache issue, I also cleared cache in firefox/ie/chrome
[09:28:11] <ptriller> Hmm its "Awake Awake2" on all browsers
[09:28:24] <VioByte> hmmm is it possible to do a onclick check for data- attribute?
[09:28:26] <AngryAngel> lolwhat :/
[09:28:26] <ptriller> on the url: http://moonlightmedia.tv/home/
[09:28:32] <andre27> ciao
[09:28:36] <andre27> list
[09:29:09] <ptriller> Opera and Safari is fine, too
[09:29:09] <AngryAngel> ptriller, but it's different
[09:29:15] <AngryAngel> If you go on wallapers/contact?
[09:29:25] <AngryAngel> wallpapers*
[09:29:29] <AngryAngel> And when you say they're fine
[09:29:34] <Lonestar99> would this be correct --> $("#bb").click(function(FunkName) { } --> how would i go about calling onclick?
[09:29:36] <AngryAngel> You mean they all display "Awake" and "awaken2" ?
[09:29:52] <AngryAngel> Opera & Safari display "Awake" "Awaken2" ?
[09:29:56] <ptriller> wallpapers: "A item" for all
[09:29:56] <AngryAngel> All pages?
[09:30:07] <ptriller> AngryAngel, Yes
[09:30:17] <AngryAngel> "A item" in safari/opera?
[09:30:53] <ptriller> On "Home" its "Awake Awake2" for all browsers on "wallpaper2  ITS 2a ITEM2 FOR ALL
[09:30:58] <ptriller> sorry .. caps
[09:31:04] <AngryAngel> Okay ty
[09:31:13] <AngryAngel> How will I ever solve this
[09:31:15] <AngryAngel> This is insane
[09:33:23] <AngryAngel> I think I may know what the problem is
[09:33:37] <AngryAngel> http://gtmetrix.com/leverage-browser-caching.html
[09:35:20] <AngryAngel> YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:35:22] <AngryAngel> Lol
[09:35:24] <AngryAngel> It works :D
[09:35:44] <VioByte> Now give yourself a cookie and get back to work :)
[09:36:02] <AngryAngel> Can't afford such luxury
[09:36:08] <VioByte> peanut?
[09:36:12] <AngryAngel> ptriller, thank you anyway :p
[09:36:12] <VioByte> :(
[09:36:20] <AngryAngel> I'll just give myself a pat on a shoulder
[09:36:59] <VioByte> so what happens whe you can't solve something?? do you slap yourself?
[09:37:03] <VioByte> when*
[09:37:07] <VioByte> i do.
[09:37:21] <AngryAngel> Pretty much
[09:37:25] <AngryAngel> facepalm all day every day
[09:38:12] <VioByte> yep.. thats the way todo it... then when you solve something, it makes the victory much sweeter.
[09:38:51] <VioByte> but until that point, you feel like a noob.
[09:38:54] <VioByte> :)
[09:42:04] <VioByte> $(document).on('click', '[data-action="run"]', function(ev) { alert($(this).attr('data-task')); });
[09:42:18] <VioByte> hmm is that even valid?
[09:44:16] <VioByte> http://jsfiddle.net/Ys7Pj/
[09:44:25] <VioByte> i really don't think its doable
[09:46:57] <VioByte> never mind.. its doable
[09:47:03] <VioByte> pfft.
[09:47:20] <Lonestar99> is there a way to execute a --> $("#bb").click(function() { }   with click of  div id="bb" && div id="pg" ??
[09:47:53] <Lonestar99> two divs id one function...
[09:49:38] <Lonestar99> i do not what to rewrite the same code for  $("#pg").click(function() { ... code ... }
[09:50:14] <VioByte> Lonestar99: $('#foo, #bar, #baz').click(function() {  myfunction(); });
[09:50:24] <VioByte> example
[09:50:31] <Lonestar99> oh ok that solves that thanks
[09:51:02] <wumpus_> hello guys i'm using :contains()
[09:51:19] <wumpus_> to get an element from its text
[09:51:32] <wumpus_> but i need an exact match
[09:52:06] <wumpus_> for example <div>john</div> <div>i'm john</div>
[09:52:28] <wumpus_> it should select only john
[09:52:50] <Lonestar99> VioByte:  that did not work ...
[09:53:19] <Lonestar99> sorry
[09:53:21] <wumpus_> is there any way to do that?
[09:53:25] <Lonestar99> my bad
[09:53:45] <VioByte> wumpus_: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[09:54:06] <Lonestar99> ok thanks
[09:54:13] <Lonestar99> bad syntax on my part
[09:54:18] <wumpus_> yeah i read that Vio but $("div:contains('john')")
[09:54:18] <Lonestar99> off 2 beach laters
[09:54:23] <wumpus_> will match both div
[09:54:23] <Lonestar99> thanks again
[09:54:35] <VioByte> hmm
[09:55:57] <Lonestar99> i was doing $("#div1","#div2") --> $("#div, #div")
[09:56:00] <Lonestar99> laters
[09:56:15] <VioByte> lol
[09:56:56] <asher^> whats the simplest way to copy an object value rather than its reference?
[09:58:56] <shoky> simplest? obja.value = objb.value;
[09:59:41] <asher^> that does a reference i think
[09:59:51] <shoky> nah
[10:00:04] <shoky> but you have to say what you mean by 'object value'
[10:01:04] <asher^> i want the value of the thing rather than just creating a reference to it, so i can delete the original
[10:01:23] <wumpus_> VioByte i found an answe on my question in contains comments
[10:01:44] <wumpus_> but the guy use $.expr[":"]
[10:01:53] <wumpus_> where should i put that?
[10:02:00] <shoky> asher^, what thing? what do you mean by its value ?
[10:02:37] <shoky> what is the value of this object:   { foo: 5, bar: 20 }
[10:02:38] <shoky> ?
[10:17:17] <ptriller> Hmm I am trying to understand the autocompleter code, but I fail utterly. I want to add "disabled" results in the autocompleter div

[10:54:03] <grifx> hi all
[10:54:14] <grifx> i've got a list.
[10:54:46] <grifx> a <ul> list, in this list, .bird, or .dog <il> element
[10:54:59] <grifx> how can i said
[10:55:30] <grifx> $('ul').not( '.bird')
[10:55:45] <grifx> $('ul li').not( '.bird')
[10:56:42] <KasperKRK> grifx, try jQuery.not();
[10:57:04] <grifx> but how can i write it
[10:57:32] <peter_ss> hey guys do you know if there is a way to position a div or span below or besides the current cursor in textarea?
[10:57:46] <ajpiano> grifx: you want to find a ul *inside* of the current ul?
[10:57:56] <ajpiano> grifx: it helps if you have a paste or demo of your markup and code
[10:58:00] <ajpiano> ?demo @ grifx
[10:58:01] <bot-t> grifx, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:58:57] <KasperKRK> grifx,    listCache = $('ul').find('li);     widthOutBird = listCache.not('.bird');    maybe. Try test it
[10:59:08] <KasperKRK> *withOutBird ;)
[11:00:36] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/AVuzN/
[11:01:25] <grifx> KasperKRK: why you don't write : $('ul li') ? why you use find ?
[11:01:57] <unlimitedesire28> by downloading jquery i get only one file, no index as i saw in saw in some tutorials, should i create a html page and include it so i can start jquery?
[11:02:07] <KasperKRK> grifx, sorry, it's my bad habit

[11:03:10] <ravenzz> hey folks can someone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/Vtt3w/ ? I haven't used map() before. I need to combine foo and bar, and have a new array of elements with the same structure of the foo's ones
[11:04:24] <grifx> $('ul li:not(.bird)').hide(); isn't working
[11:04:25] <KasperKRK> grifx, http://jsfiddle.net/AVuzN/3/
[11:04:42] <KasperKRK> list = $('ul li').not('.bird');
[11:04:58] <KasperKRK> return list without div with bird class
[11:04:59] <grifx> KasperKRK: cool thanks
[11:05:03] <ajpiano> grifx: you should probably read see ?ftj
[11:05:04] <bot-t> grifx, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:05:14] <ajpiano> it will teach you a lot of techniques that will help you at solving your problems
[11:05:24] <grifx> ok
[11:05:25] <grifx> $('ul li:not(.bird)').hide();
[11:05:27] <grifx> but
[11:05:29] <grifx> in the doc
[11:05:47] <grifx> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[11:05:52] <unlimitedesire28> what is smart
[11:06:24] <grifx> idon't know why $('ul li:not(.bird)').hide(); isn't working
[11:06:34] <KasperKRK> oO
[11:06:40] <KasperKRK> grifx, What you try to do?
[11:06:56] <grifx> KasperKRK: what you write is good
[11:07:04] <grifx> but, i read something on the doc
[11:07:11] <grifx> that's didn't work
[11:07:11] <KasperKRK> you want hide all elements with bird class?
[11:07:32] <grifx> if i read the doc  :$('ul li:not(.bird)').hide();
[11:07:35] <grifx> must work
[11:08:03] <ajpiano> grifx: it does work. http://jsfiddle.net/AVuzN/4/
[11:09:08] <ravenzz> helq?
[11:09:37] <dabear_> helq??
[11:09:57] <ravenzz> help :p
[11:09:59] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/AVuzN/6/
[11:10:09] <grifx> ajpiano: why my doesn't work
[11:10:21] <ajpiano> grifx: you aren't including jQuery in yours.
[11:10:29] <grifx> oh
[11:10:40] <grifx> ajpiano: ok jsfiddle is new for me
[11:10:41] <grifx> thanks
[11:11:08] <grifx> coool
[11:11:24] <ravenzz> bird is the word
[11:11:26] <ravenzz> !
[11:11:55] <grifx> How can i uncheck elements ?
[11:11:59] <grifx> like
[11:12:13] <grifx> ('.checkbox').unCheck
[11:12:23] <ajpiano> $(".checkbox").prop("checked", false)
[11:12:24] <KasperKRK> grifx, maybe you should use google?
[11:12:28] <ajpiano> also that
[11:12:42] <grifx> KasperKRK: there is nothing on the doc
[11:12:45] <KasperKRK> or try it with yourself before send question?
[11:13:04] <KasperKRK> grifx, yap...
[11:13:04] <KasperKRK> https://www.google.pl/search?gcx=w&sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=how+uncheck+input+jquery
[11:13:07] <grifx> but i'm not lucky , i thind it doesnt work
[11:13:21] <grifx> i use bing sorry
[11:13:26] <ravenzz> lol
[11:13:36] <grifx> i'll try google now
[11:13:43] <KasperKRK> goood (:
[11:13:54] <ravenzz> dabear_ have you read my question?
[11:14:41] <peter_ss> hey guys do you have any idea or tips to show a div or span below a cursor position?
[11:14:54] <ravenzz> uhm?
[11:14:56] <ravenzz> hover
[11:14:57] <ravenzz> :?
[11:15:05] <ajpiano> ravenzz: i love how patient you are
[11:15:08] <grifx> var test = "bird". do you think that $('.'+test).hide() will work ?
[11:15:15] <ajpiano> and how hard you try to solve problems
[11:15:17] <ajpiano> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/Vtt3w/1/
[11:15:22] <ravenzz> lol
[11:15:44] <peter_ss> ravenzz during keypress
[11:16:31] <ravenzz> ajpiano I can't guess who is trying to help me if he/she doesn't tell me anything. thank you anyway. let me check
[11:16:52] <ajpiano> ravenzz: you really need to try to help yourself more
[11:17:01] <ajpiano> like, actually writing out a map command and seeing what happens
[11:17:05] <ajpiano> and wrestling with it for awhile
[11:17:07] <ajpiano> would be a lot better
[11:17:08] <unlimitedesire28> this was easy man, thanks for ignoring :) might need help later
[11:17:23] <ajpiano> than just be like "um, i don't know how to use map, and i haven't tried"
[11:17:38] <ajpiano> i don't even know why i just faciliitated the opposite of that :|
[11:18:02] <grifx> KasperKRK: google is very fast
[11:18:15] <ravenzz> I know, that's something I should change about myself
[11:18:22] <grifx> KasperKRK: do you have other trick
[11:18:34] <ravenzz> I am damn lazy
[11:18:35] <ravenzz> sorry
[11:19:07] <ajpiano> ravenzz: lets make a deal
[11:19:07] <ravenzz> I won't ask again before having tried for at least 15minutes
[11:19:08] <ajpiano> from now on
[11:19:11] <mosdef100200> Hi there anyone know where might find a source to achieve this in jquery http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow/
[11:19:16] <ajpiano> i will just tell you to try things
[11:19:20] <ajpiano> instead of solving the problem
[11:19:27] <ajpiano> and yeah, that sounds good too
[11:19:33] <ajpiano> ravenzz: it helps to take an incremental approach to solving this
[11:19:53] <ajpiano> just like, put map with an empty function and see what that looks like, then just build it out iteratively
[11:20:54] <grifx> ajpiano: i search something on google i don't find
[11:21:21] <ajpiano> grifx: searching for something on google doesn't mean "typing in your first guess in to google, looking at it for a minute, and then giving up"
[11:21:46] <grifx> $('ul li:not(.bird)').attr('class','test'); if i want to do this and another thing on the same line
[11:21:50] <ajpiano> you look around at different things till you find something that might work, or you adapt something that works etc
[11:22:00] <ravenzz> ajpiano np, basically that's the way how I learn things...I know how to learn at least :)
[11:22:07] <ajpiano> :)
[11:22:23] <maZtah> how to get only the first matched element with this line?
[11:22:25] <maZtah> $("#sign_up_extra_form [style*='display: none']");
[11:22:36] <ajpiano> ?first
[11:22:36] <bot-t> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[11:22:50] <maZtah> oh damn
[11:22:51] <ravenzz> anyway I have to fix a thing downstairs, I'll be back in 10 minutes. That isn't still done
[11:22:59] <grifx> ajpiano: where can i put function(){} on my line : $('ul li:not(.bird)').attr('class','test');
[11:23:05] <ravenzz> I should get only the 9871321298 elem
[11:23:15] <ajpiano> ravenzz: work on it :)
[11:23:22] <KasperKRK> grifx, try it -> tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[11:23:31] <johnkpaul> ?learn @grifx
[11:23:32] <bot-t> grifx, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:23:32] <maZtah> ajpiano: and the first two?
[11:23:49] <grifx> KasperKRK: it's my last question
[11:23:56] <johnkpaul> ?slice @maZtah
[11:23:57] <bot-t> maZtah, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[11:23:58] <grifx> please
[11:23:59] <ajpiano> maZtah: you can use slie
[11:24:02] <maZtah> okay, thanks
[11:24:06] <ajpiano> grifx: .each(function() { });
[11:24:16] <ajpiano> then you will run the function in the context of each element that was matched
[11:24:22] <ajpiano> you can't just "put function on the line"
[11:24:26] <ajpiano> and have it magically work
[11:24:31] <johnkpaul> :D
[11:24:37] <johnkpaul> hey ajpiano, how's it going
[11:24:53] <ajpiano> alright, thx for the PR
[11:25:00] <ajpiano> :)
[11:25:26] <johnkpaul> the PR?
[11:25:46] <johnkpaul> oh
[11:25:48] <ajpiano> pull re..
[11:25:49] <ajpiano> :D
[11:25:51] <johnkpaul> ha
[11:25:52] <johnkpaul> I got it
[11:25:54] <johnkpaul> immediately after
[11:26:05] <johnkpaul> no problem, I'll tackle something a little more meaty in the future
[11:26:26] <ajpiano> haha yea there is a lot to do
[11:26:27] <ajpiano> :|
[11:26:49] <johnkpaul> yeah, and most of my times this weekend and last was dedicated to taxes, as I'm sure others are feeling too
[11:27:04] <johnkpaul> and there is a lot to do, but a lot is done, it's pretty cool seeing how much material is already there
[11:27:30] <ajpiano> yeah :)
[11:27:38] <ajpiano> i am stuck only seeing it for what it needs :)
[11:27:55] <ajpiano> hoping to get that rectified over the next few weeks with the help of some #jquery-ers :)
[11:28:05] <johnkpaul> yeah, the plight of the core contributors :)
[11:28:15] <grifx> i'm a jquery KILLLER
[11:28:17] <johnkpaul> it seems like there are a few people submitting new content
[11:28:26] <grifx> thanks
[11:28:38] <grifx> i make something soo good
[11:28:49] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: there've been drips and drabs
[11:29:03] <grifx> thanks ajpiano  and KasperKRK  for patience
[11:29:18] <grifx> bye i need to eat
[11:29:32] <grifx> i have to eat...
[11:29:49] <grifx> for survive
[11:31:05] <ravenzz> ajpiano I am trying to do a "join" on the id
[11:31:09] <ravenzz> btw
[11:31:16] <ajpiano> a "join" ?
[11:31:22] <ajpiano> this isn't sql
[11:31:41] <ravenzz> I know, I am sure you got it :o
[11:32:07] <ajpiano> ravenzz: you're gonna end up having to concat the two arrays together and then filter out dupes
[11:32:19] <ravenzz> so foo will contain only the element with id 9871321298
[11:32:26] <ravenzz> in this exampe
[11:32:27] <johnkpaul> from not being here for the beginning, asking for a join on an id in jquery is really confusing
[11:32:29] <ravenzz> +l
[11:32:31] <johnkpaul> ?filter @ravenzz
[11:32:32] <bot-t> ravenzz, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:58:36] <ravenzz> ajpiano http://jsfiddle.net/Vtt3w/3/ ;)
[12:16:08] <Whirl3d> is there any way to do a sprite without using the background position trick?
[12:16:25] <Whirl3d> LIke maybe clipping?
[12:17:01] <Whirl3d> sorry, I thought I had #css open.
[12:17:25] <johnkpaul> :)
[12:20:20] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/9uMe4/
[12:20:45] <grifx> how can i do to run the script on the bind when the page is load
[12:21:42] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/9uMe4/1/
[12:21:45] <grifx> sorry
[12:22:21] <grifx> I want to execute the script that's on the bind, when the page is load
[12:22:50] <grifx> http://jsfiddle.net/9uMe4/2/ grrr
[12:23:08] <conor_ireland> what would be the best way to make instapaper be able to have re-orderable items?
[12:23:11] <Advocated> If ive got lots of auto completes sending off to a php file, is it a bad idea to have on my inputs, things like data-table_name data-field_name so i can make one auto complete which choses which table to use and therefore which field too?
[12:27:05] <grifx> How can i execute the code that is on the bind on the load of the page too : http://jsfiddle.net/9uMe4/2/
[12:30:12] <johnkpaul> ?ready @grifx
[12:30:12] <bot-t> grifx, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[12:31:09] <grifx> johnkpaul: so i have to create a function
[12:31:27] <grifx> johnkpaul: and call him twice, with .ready and with bind
[12:31:38] <johnkpaul> yeah
[12:32:25] <grifx> but i've a $(this).
[12:32:37] <grifx> johnkpaul: jquery will understand
[12:33:07] <johnkpaul> no, it won't
[12:33:22] <johnkpaul> you'll need to bind that this value appropriately
[12:33:29] <johnkpaul> ?proxy @fr0ggie
[12:33:29] <bot-t> fr0ggie, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:33:34] <johnkpaul> oops, I meant @grifx
[12:33:51] <ravenzz> you don't need to use each anyway
[12:34:05] <ravenzz> you can bind on the selection directly
[12:35:44] <johnkpaul> that's true, listen to ravenzz, grifx
[12:36:09] <grifx> ok
[12:36:17] <johnkpaul> also, now that I read your ocde more carefully, you don't need proxy, you can just trigger the change event
[12:36:22] <johnkpaul> ?trigger @grifx
[12:36:23] <bot-t> grifx, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:36:38] <ravenzz> as I like the easy things I wouldn't use proxy
[12:36:44] <ravenzz> ah ok
[12:37:00] <grifx> ah yes
[12:37:16] <grifx> i forgot trigger
[12:37:44] <ravenzz> bind is good
[12:38:12] <grifx> ravenzz: i havn't to use each ?
[12:39:20] <ravenzz> you need to define your function, on domready select the radio inputs, use each on them (pass the yourFunction as function instead of an anonymous one)
[12:39:52] <ravenzz> then use bind to attach the same function to the change event
[12:40:26] <grifx> ravenzz: trigger isn't a good idea ?
[12:40:55] <ravenzz> you mean bind and then trigger?
[12:41:42] <grifx> ravenzz: yes
[12:42:00] <grifx> it's works fine, but many it's ugly
[12:42:05] <grifx> maby*
[12:42:08] <ravenzz> i guess so
[12:42:15] <ravenzz> i this particular example
[12:42:46] <grifx> irc is really cool
[12:42:57] <grifx> Now i'm not alone
[12:42:59] <grifx> thanks
[12:47:17] <fr0ggie> hmm?
[12:48:33] <johnkpaul> sorry, fr0ggie, didn't mean to mention you
[12:51:25] <fr0ggie> no worries
[12:52:27] <Advocated> Any ideas on this please http://jsfiddle.net/6jtTd/  i've basically just added the small section for data: { test : "test", term : $(this).val() },  but it doesn't appear to be sending it through. Any ideas please?
[12:54:45] <johnkpaul> Advocated: I don't think that's how you specifiy a data source for an autocomplete
[12:54:48] <johnkpaul> are you using jquery ui?
[12:55:03] <Advocated> i am indeed
[12:55:18] <Advocated> it was working fine til i've added that data in there
[12:55:27] <Advocated> because i want to send additional params across
[12:55:45] <johnkpaul> you mean across in your ajax request?
[12:56:36] <johnkpaul> Advocated: look at this example http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[12:56:41] <johnkpaul> that's how you should send etxra data
[12:57:20] <Turbohao> greetings
[13:04:16] <Whirl3d> you know what would be nice to have in $.map....  a returnUnique option...that would somehow do your filter option and then it could be aware of any previously returned values and only return the current value if it hasn't been returned before...
[13:05:35] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: are you mapping over dom elements?
[13:05:39] <johnkpaul> jquery ahs a .uniq I believe
[13:05:41] <johnkpaul> ?uniq
[13:05:42] <bot-t> johnkpaul, jQuery.unique() - Sorts an array of DOM elements, in place, with the duplicates removed. Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[13:07:31] <Whirl3d> Naw. I'm filtering the data before generating the DOM elements as one big html string...but I would love to be able to use the syntax $.map(collection, function (elem) { returnUnique(elem.series);});
[13:09:26] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: then why not define a return unique function yourself
[13:10:22] <disappearedng> Any nice announcment bar plugins? I want a one line bar that I can queue messages to it and the user can see what the past announcements are
[13:23:51] <Whirl3d> sometimes I get all wrapped up in jquery's goodness that I forget that it's really just javascript! http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Z9xdc/2/
[13:26:01] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't know if I'd endorse the mofidiation to the array prototype
[13:26:11] <johnkpaul> especially because you're making assumptions about the type of the elements inside the array
[13:26:16] <johnkpaul> have you ever heard of underscore.js Whirl3d?
[13:26:41] <Whirl3d> no, sir, I have not. I am assuming it helps with naming conventions?
[13:27:55] <Whirl3d> Just what I needed. You are a wealth of really valuable knowledge. Thanks.
[13:29:19] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[13:29:44] <johnkpaul> it's a set of utility functions defined on _
[13:29:48] <johnkpaul> that are really helpful
[13:29:53] <johnkpaul> and would have made that code trivial
[13:31:21] <Whirl3d> Where has underscore.js been all my life. I have had to develop most of these functions myself at some point. Wow. Thanks a ton.
[13:34:13] <johnkpaul> no problem, whenever you feel like you're doing something over and over again, someone's probably library-ized it
[13:34:13] <oojacoboo_> Whirl3d: a "list" ?
[13:34:40] <oojacoboo_> the lib keeps referring to a "list", what's a list?
[13:35:10] <Whirl3d> an Array
[13:35:30] <oojacoboo> why not call it an array :/
[13:36:05] <RandalSchwartz> if it's like Perl, an array is the container... a list is the value
[13:36:16] <RandalSchwartz> and that's a pretty common distinction as I recall.
[13:36:19] <oojacoboo> ah, that'd make more sense
[13:36:19] <Whirl3d> becuase they add a bunch of methods to the array, making it a list, not an array
[13:36:45] <Whirl3d> or what he said, LOL
[13:37:02] <oojacoboo> I'm curious to see some demos of this
[13:37:26] <johnkpaul> of underscore.js?
[13:37:30] <oojacoboo> yea
[13:37:37] <oojacoboo> some use cases
[13:37:40] <johnkpaul> Backbone.js relies on it, there's a huge example of it
[13:38:10] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/backbone.html
[13:38:24] <johnkpaul> it's also one of the best examples of code documentation
[13:38:29] <johnkpaul> in my opinion
[13:40:13] <Whirl3d> so, how can I check to see if a script is loaded inside another script. I will need to verify that underscore.js is loaded before my script, how can I do that without manually checking every markup?
[13:41:06] <johnkpaul> if(_)
[13:43:09] <johnkpaul> although Whirl3d, that's probably not the best idea without some regression testing
[13:43:18] <johnkpaul> how does your html templating work?
[13:43:33] <johnkpaul> do you have a single header that you could include this in? or a js build process?
[13:44:47] <Whirl3d> On this project, I am at liberty to do whatever I want-seriously. I would LOVE suggestions. It's a simple, simple, site
[13:57:54] <oojacoboo> johnkpaul: thanks for that, sorry I was getting a fridge delivered
[13:58:12] <oojacoboo> I guess I don't quite understand how the models work in js
[14:00:19] <ptriller> How do I get the previous Sibling in the DOM of a tag I got in an .each loop ?
[14:00:37] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: models?
[14:00:47] <oojacoboo> model*
[14:00:53] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: is this wordpress or something?
[14:01:06] <johnkpaul> ptriller: $(this).prev()
[14:01:16] <oojacoboo> is that not the point of backbone, to provide the model layer?
[14:01:19] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: sorry, I'm still confused, how th modelw ork?
[14:01:20] <johnkpaul> oh
[14:01:30] <johnkpaul> it actually provides botht he model and the view
[14:01:33] <johnkpaul> and a routing system
[14:01:41] <oojacoboo> ah
[14:01:45] <ptriller> johnkpaul, hmm the doc confused me there it was talking about a selected set
[14:01:55] <oojacoboo> even still, this notion of a model in js is confusing to me
[14:02:21] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: what about the js part is confusing
[14:02:32] <oojacoboo> well, js is inherently based on the DOM
[14:02:39] <johnkpaul> a model is an abstraction of information regardless of programming language
[14:02:39] <johnkpaul> oh
[14:02:40] <johnkpaul> no it's not

[14:02:49] <oojacoboo> well, within the browser
[14:02:50] <johnkpaul> ?g rhino
[14:02:50] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Modeling tools for designers - http://www.rhino3d.com/
[14:02:53] <oojacoboo> I'm familiar with SSJS
[14:02:57] <johnkpaul> ha, that's not the rhino I'm looking for
[14:03:30] <johnkpaul> oh, then what do you mean?
[14:03:35] <oojacoboo> I guess I'm just confused how backbone is going to manage your model across multiple DOM instances
[14:03:43] <johnkpaul> js is not inherently b ased on the DOM, that's a big part of the point of backbone/other mv* frameworks
[14:03:51] <oojacoboo> so, if I refresh the page, how does the data persist?
[14:03:53] <johnkpaul> DOM instances?
[14:03:54] <oojacoboo> the objets*
[14:03:59] <johnkpaul> oh, that's up to you
[14:04:06] <johnkpaul> override backbone.sync to whatever backend you want
[14:04:12] <johnkpaul> localstorage or an ajax server side
[14:04:13] <oojacoboo> mmm
[14:04:18] <johnkpaul> :) this is a conversation for #documentcloud
[14:04:21] <johnkpaul> but since no one else is talking
[14:04:25] <oojacoboo> yea...
[14:04:42] <johnkpaul> ptriller: let me know if you're still confused $(this).prev() should work
[14:05:08] <oojacoboo> johnkpaul: does localstorage persist across a refresh?
[14:05:09] <ptriller> johnkpaul, I am writing some test code now, lets see how this turns out :)
[14:05:40] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: yeah, that's the point
[14:06:38] <oojacoboo> I guess the main benefit in my eyes would be the templating b/c that's a disaster manually, or can be over time as the complexity increases
[14:06:54] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: backbone has it's own solution for that too using _.template
[14:07:11] <oojacoboo> yea, but you can use handlebars or mustache, no?
[14:07:18] <johnkpaul> yes, you can
[14:07:55] <oojacoboo> I'm curious about getting into implementing some of these things, we just have a fully developed platform, so it's tough
[14:08:27] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: http://addyosmani.com/scalablejs/
[14:08:53] <oojacoboo> oh God, star wars ><
[14:13:35] <raj> anyone know why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/1/
[14:13:50] <raj> it's supposed to remove and used options from the $select_template being added
[14:13:58] <raj> but if you select Dogs, and then Cats
[14:14:04] <raj> Dogs in the first box
[14:14:11] <raj> then Cats in the subsequent box
[14:14:17] <raj> , the 3rd box still shows Cats
[14:22:34] <ptriller> Hmm I cant seem to find a way to get the "tagname" of an $( this ) object
[14:22:49] <Whirl3d> You are going to have to get all the options selected already and remove them every time you add a sort level.
[14:27:02] <johnkpaul> ptriller: $(this).get(0).nodeName
[14:27:06] <johnkpaul> or this this.nodeName
[14:27:08] <johnkpaul> or tagName
[14:27:14] <johnkpaul> I never remember which is the correct one to be honest
[14:28:34] <yakko> hey guys, I have <div id="posts"></div> and I want to insert code inside it, how do I do it? $("posts").html += ""; $("posts").append(""); ???
[14:29:03] <shoky> $('#posts').append(...)
[14:31:47] <yakko> shoky: won't append write it after the div? or inside it?
[14:32:05] <shoky> yakko: inside
[14:32:13] <shoky> why don't you read the docs
[14:32:18] <shoky> for .append()
[14:32:20] <yakko> shoky: oh cool, I was thinking wrong lol
[14:32:35] <yakko> shoky: I'm writing a documentation for something else right now, sorry I know it's a lame question
[14:33:07] <shoky> that didn't stop you from asking on irc
[14:33:33] <shoky> ?append
[14:33:33] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:41:51] <Whirl3d> raj, what about this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GuBjH/5/
[14:41:56] <Whirl3d> is that what you are looking for?
[14:42:19] <Whirl3d> I cloned the last select field each time, removing that's field's selected option before appending it
[14:42:26] <Whirl3d> That way you never get dups
[14:51:38] <oojacoboo> why is _everything_ a TypeError
[14:51:45] <oojacoboo> so annoying
[15:03:10] <djayb6> hello
[15:04:32] <n00by> anyone managed to setup https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload on rails?
[15:04:41] <djayb6> I know that I must use event delegation to make events work after inserting ajax response, but what should i do to make basic (non-event) js work ?
[15:06:01] <djayb6> I put all my javascript instructions in a main file at the end of the body (which is never modified)
[15:21:43] <oojacoboo> can someone please explain the use of $(this) with the .on() method?
[15:22:15] <oojacoboo> I've had mixed success, where, in cases $(this) applied to the element which was delegated to, and others where the delegated element was referred to
[15:22:38] <oojacoboo> and in both cases I am almost positive I was using delegation, not self binding
[15:28:37] <xenaxon> is it ok to use jquery inline?
[15:30:41] <oojacoboo> xenaxon: if you don't give a shit about what you're doing
[15:32:38] <johnkpaul> oojacoboo: can you make up a jsfiddle where it is the delegated to element?
[15:32:43] <djayb6> nobody has an answer to my question ?
[15:33:09] <oojacoboo> johnkpaul: are you saying that's typically not the case?
[15:33:21] <oojacoboo> meaning that it's generally the delegated object?
[15:33:30] <oojacoboo> delegatory object* or whatever
[15:33:42] <johnkpaul> I don't have a good understanding of the correct jargon
[15:33:56] <oojacoboo> the object holding the binding*
[15:34:04] <oojacoboo> vs the one being bound
[15:34:14] <johnkpaul> usually this is the individual element where the event happened on
[15:34:28] <oojacoboo> right
[15:34:42] <oojacoboo> I had a case just yesterday where I had to use event.target :/
[15:34:47] <oojacoboo> $(this) wouldn't work
[15:34:48] <johnkpaul> so if you are using something like $("div").delegate("span","click",function(e){this});
[15:34:51] <johnkpaul> the this should be the span
[15:34:53] <johnkpaul> not the div
[15:35:09] <oojacoboo> does that work the same with the on() method?
[15:35:27] <oojacoboo> delegate is being deprecated, no?
[15:35:28] <johnkpaul> it should, .delegate just delegates (hehe) to the on method
[15:35:35] <johnkpaul> yes, it is
[15:36:39] <djayb6> ?
[15:37:25] <oojacoboo> johnkpaul: I found the instance where that was the case, and it's actually working correctly as there was another issue causing that, thanks for clearing that up though, it seemed to be a bit confusing
[15:37:48] <oojacoboo> I guess the main issue is that you'd think this would refer the the object, which is the element you are delegated to
[15:38:15] <oojacoboo> mainly b/c it's the object you're performing the binding (action) on
[15:38:34] <oojacoboo> but eitherway, that saves me steps, so I like it better, just the logic… well :/
[15:38:41] <johnkpaul> hmm, I guess since .live/.delegate was originally a way to mimic the regular bind with newly geneated elements
[15:38:48] <johnkpaul> most people expect it the other way, but I see your argument
[15:39:06] <oojacoboo> johnkpaul: if I don't think about it too much, I expect it that way too :P
[15:39:10] <oojacoboo> too much thinking...
[15:39:19] <johnkpaul> if you originally used .unbind("click.my_namespace").bind("click.my_namespace")
[15:39:23] <johnkpaul> :)
[15:51:56] <ptriller> stupid js .. why is the empty string "false" .. I want everything except empty string
[15:54:48] <oojacoboo> $foo != "";
[16:16:59] <ptriller> stupid internet explorer .. foild again by your evil schemes
[16:34:12] <tw2113> evil schemas?
[16:40:13] <raj> Whirl3d, yes, that works correctly
[16:40:20] <raj> I don't understand what the issue with mine is though
[16:40:44] <coldhead> well well well, the eternal raj
[16:40:55] <raj> eternal?
[16:40:59] <raj> i die more everyday
[16:41:18] <djayb6> I would like to execute a certain function only when $.ajax() is executed
[16:41:23] <djayb6> is it possible ?
[16:41:28] <raj> djayb6, in the callback?
[16:41:50] <johnkpaul> ?ajaxcomplete @djayb6
[16:41:50] <bot-t> djayb6, .ajaxComplete(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[16:42:21] <johnkpaul> or actually
[16:42:24] <johnkpaul> ?ajaxstart
[16:42:24] <bot-t> .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[16:42:32] <johnkpaul> ?ajaxstop
[16:42:32] <bot-t> .ajaxStop(handler): Register a handler to be called when all Ajax requests have completed. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/
[16:42:36] <johnkpaul> one of those might be more appropriate
[16:42:39] <johnkpaul> and they are global events
[16:42:46] <raj> alright, obv the allstars show up and shit on my answer
[16:43:31] <djayb6> thanks johnkpaul !
[16:43:31] <johnkpaul> :( didn't mean to convey that at all
[16:43:36] <djayb6> and thanks raj :p
[16:44:12] <djayb6> but I needed something global ;)
[16:47:07] <tw2113> .effect
[16:47:11] <tw2113> ?effect
[16:47:12] <bot-t> tw2113, UI/Effects/effect - Uses a specific effect on an element (without the show/hide logic). http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/effect
[16:47:16] <tw2113> there we go
[16:47:48] <raj> johnkpaul, I know you didn't
[16:47:52] <raj> just happened :)
[16:49:22] <johnkpaul> well definitely props for answering a question
[16:49:33] <raj> haha!
[16:49:39] <raj> doesn't matter that it was incorrect
[16:49:41] <raj> lmao
[16:49:46] <johnkpaul> no, I'm serious, it wasn't incorrect
[16:50:04] <johnkpaul> for the wording of the question you were posed, it wasn't incorrect
[16:50:25] <raj> ok, good :)
[16:50:29] <johnkpaul> you're right, if you want something to run when $.ajax is executed, passing it in the callback is the way to do it
[16:50:30] <raj> thanks
[16:50:34] <johnkpaul> :)
[16:54:43] <raj> Whirl3d, I see you did it a little bit differently
[16:54:49] <raj> you made sortOrder sort of a global
[16:54:56] <raj> is that where I faultered?
[16:55:09] <raj> cuz I still don't see the issue with my code
[16:55:13] <zef88> Hello, when trying to get mouse position, why could e.pageY  be returning "NaN" ?
[16:59:08] <zef88> Hello, when trying to get mouse position, why could e.pageY  be returning "NaN" ?
[16:59:37] <raj> zef88, what does e.pageX return?
[16:59:49] <zef88> pageX returns the right number
[17:00:59] <Nomikos> Nice one, got a url? I'm curious now
[17:11:40] <gentlemandroid> Anyone want to give a newb some advice?
[17:12:11] <gentlemandroid> I'm building a database for a survey conducting company
[17:12:45] <raj> go go gae
[17:13:08] <unlimitedesire27> ^#leb
[17:13:28] <unlimitedesire27> #leb
[17:14:40] <raj> why does this not work--> http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/1/ and this works--> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GuBjH/5/
[17:14:59] <coldhead> one of them has a bug?
[17:15:16] <raj> why does this not work--> http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/1/ and this works--> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GuBjH/5/ . You can see it not work by selecting Dog, and then Cat in the following box, and noticing that Cat is still in the 3rd box
[17:15:24] <raj> (more complete question) :)
[17:15:40] <raj> coldhead, cool, can you tell me more? :)
[17:21:07] <shoky> raj, first of all, you should use .end()
[17:21:11] <shoky> instead of .parent('select')
[17:21:19] <shoky> to 'end' the .find()
[17:21:50] <raj> shoky, oh, I didn't use .end() to end the find
[17:21:53] <raj> I needed the parent of it
[17:22:07] <shoky> yes
[17:22:23] <shoky> that isn't the problem, yeah
[17:23:04] <shoky> anyway why not just debug it?
[17:23:09] <raj> meaning?
[17:23:17] <raj> i've been trying to debug! :)
[17:23:19] <raj> i can't figure it out
[17:23:24] <raj> it looks good ot me
[17:23:43] <shoky> i mean putting a breakpoint somewhere and stepping each step
[17:23:47] <shoky> in a debugger
[17:23:48] <raj> i see that higher_used_sortcriteria has the correct values in it
[17:23:54] <shoky> like in chrome's developer tools
[17:23:59] <shoky> or firebug
[17:24:22] <raj> cuz i don't know how to step through the debugger
[17:24:33] <shoky> always good to learn that ;) it's very simple
[17:25:19] <shoky> or you could just put lots of logging to see why you're not calling .remove() on the element you wanna remove
[17:26:42] <raj> shoky, that's exactly what I did
[17:26:46] <raj> and I just couldn't figure it out
[17:26:58] <raj> i need to learn this stepping through though
[17:27:16] <shoky> got chrome?
[17:27:48] <raj> yep
[17:27:50] <raj> that's what I'm using
[17:27:59] <shoky> ctrl-shift-i for developer tools
[17:28:08] <shoky> go to scripts tab, find your script
[17:28:35] <shoky> click on the line-number of the line you wanna 'break' at (where you wanna start manually stepping)
[17:28:45] <shoky> it should highlight, meaning you set the breakpoint
[17:29:29] <raj> yup
[17:29:32] <raj> done
[17:29:45] <raj> shoky, how do I find the line I want in jsfiddle though
[17:29:53] <raj> since fiddle has all that extra crap
[17:29:57] <shoky> uhm
[17:30:09] <shoky> lets see
[17:30:29] <shoky> there should be some statement you could put there
[17:30:34] <shoky> like 'debugger;'
[17:30:36] <shoky> in your code
[17:30:44] <shoky> but i forget how it works exactly
[17:31:21] <shoky> yeah try putting in your code: debugger;
[17:31:31] <shoky> hmm
[17:32:16] <shoky> ok dunno ;)
[17:32:32] <raj> k
[17:32:37] <raj> that's some keyword?
[17:32:42] <raj> i mean special word
[17:33:01] <shoky> yeah
[17:33:17] <shoky> it seems to work some of the times
[17:33:18] <raj> you can't even search through the script with the Search Scripts field in console
[17:33:19] <shoky> in jsfiddle
[17:33:35] <raj> i was looking for $select_template
[17:33:46] <shoky> put debugger; in your code
[17:33:51] <shoky> and run it
[17:34:00] <shoky> the debugger should pop up
[17:34:07] <raj> k
[17:34:22] <shoky> if you're in developer-tools that is
[17:34:28] <shoky> scripts tab
[17:34:28] <raj> nice
[17:34:30] <raj> that worked
[17:34:42] <shoky> so then you're paused on that line
[17:34:48] <shoky> F8 resumes normally
[17:35:00] <shoky> f10 steps over the current line
[17:35:11] <shoky> f11 steps into it (if its a function call)
[17:35:33] <raj> can I step back?
[17:35:53] <shoky> don't think so, but you can always run it again ;p
[17:36:05] <shoky> and put breakpoint in different spots
[17:36:09] <raj> and what's the difference btwn stepping over the current line and stepping "into it"?
[17:36:46] <raj> oh, i see, it's under show/
[17:36:48] <shoky> if there's a function call, stepping 'into' will jump to that function so you can see what happens inside the call
[17:36:53] <raj> my script, that is
[17:37:01] <coldhead> step over returns immediately
[17:37:08] <shoky> if you step over it'll just run the function call
[17:37:32] <shoky> if the function returns immediately ;p
[17:37:40] <raj> oh
[17:37:42] <raj> i understand
[17:37:53] <shoky> play with it, you'll get the hang of it
[17:37:59] <coldhead> that's what she said
[17:38:16] <shoky> you can see the differnet objects/variables and their current state on the right side
[17:38:52] <raj> haha
[17:43:04] <raj> why is getOrdinal listed undr Closure?
[17:43:07] <raj> *under
[17:47:03] <shoky> dunno, does that bother you
[17:48:56] <raj> i just wanted to understand what it meant
[17:50:25] <shoky> closures are the variables in a function's scope, when you keep a reference to them after the function returns
[17:51:12] <raj> shoky, you mean non-local variables?
[17:51:23] <shoky> well actually any function you declare inside another function is called a closure
[17:51:32] <raj> well, it's not declared
[17:51:39] <raj> correct?
[17:51:54] <raj> it hs to be set to a variable or within ( ) or voided, no?
[17:51:56] <shoky> what's not?
[17:51:57] <raj> *has
[17:52:01] <shoky> $(window).load(function(){
[17:52:01] <shoky> function getOrdinal(n) {
[17:52:12] <shoky> getOrdinal is defined within another (anonymous) function
[17:52:17] <raj> that's allowed?
[17:52:18] <shoky> hence it's called a closure
[17:52:21] <shoky> sure
[17:52:24] <raj> oh
[17:52:35] <shoky> functions are first-class types in javascript
[17:52:41] <shoky> you can use a function like you use a variable
[17:52:43] <raj> my discussion with someone in ##js left me thinking i couldn't
[17:53:01] <shoky> jsfiddle is doing it i guess in your case
[17:53:15] <raj> k
[17:53:22] <shoky> try debugging outside of jsfiddle to get a clearer picture of what's happening in your code
[17:53:43] <shoky> just download the external scripts or whatever that you need
[17:53:46] <shoky> ;p
[17:54:29] <raj> k
[17:54:45] <raj> btw, I breaked on line 52 in show/ script
[17:54:56] <raj> and I've got all these errors on the bottom (8 in total)
[17:55:03] <raj> can you tell me why those are there?
[17:55:11] <raj> Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/3/ from frame with URL http://fiddle.jshell.net/Yyvbg/3/show/. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[17:55:56] <shoky> dunno man it's cause you're doing it in jsfiddle
[17:56:04] <shoky> hardly a 'pure' environment
[17:56:05] <raj> oh
[17:56:06] <raj> k
[17:56:09] <raj> noted
[17:57:12] <raj> thanks for the mini-lesson shoky :)
[17:57:51] <shoky> np
[17:58:46] <g0th> hi
[17:59:21] <shoky> helo
[17:59:35] <g0th> what exactly are jquery's offset().left and offset().top doing ??
[17:59:47] <shoky> ?offset
[17:59:47] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[18:00:01] <g0th> I mean I want to get the same behaviour without jquery
[18:00:16] <shoky> then have a look at jquery's code ;)
[18:00:17] <g0th> but I don't understand all those stuff in the source
[18:00:29] <shoky> such as?
[18:00:35] <g0th> did you look at it?
[18:00:41] <g0th> it seems extremely complicated
[18:00:43] <shoky> not recently
[18:01:12] <shoky> being all-browser-compatible usually is
[18:01:22] <romsok> Hi, I was wondering if someone can help me out. I am using jquery ui SELECTABLE. in it I define a "stop" function. In the function I am trying to identify the selected list element - but the javascript  code fails on that
[18:02:12] <romsok> $("#mylist").selectable({
[18:02:12] <romsok> 		stop: function() {
[18:02:12] <romsok> 			
[18:02:12] <romsok> 			alert("selected: " + $(".ui-selected"));
[18:02:12] <romsok> 			var c_id = $(".ui-selected").attr("id");
[18:02:12] <romsok> 			alert("id: " + id);
[18:02:16] <g0th> is there any nice way to get offset().left without jquery?
[18:02:25] <shoky> romsok don't paste here, use jsfiddle
[18:02:30] <romsok> k
[18:02:32] <romsok> one second
[18:02:39] <shoky> g0th what do you mean by nice ?
[18:02:46] <g0th> doable by me
[18:02:52] <shoky> yes, copy & paste from jquery
[18:02:54] <shoky> wtf?
[18:03:04] <g0th> I cannot just copy and paste
[18:03:08] <g0th> it calls all kinds of functions
[18:03:16] <g0th> in the end I will have the whole jquery code there
[18:03:31] <shoky> you want to be compatible with all browsers dont you?
[18:03:35] <g0th> yes
[18:03:42] <g0th> but I just need offset().left
[18:03:45] <g0th> not all the other jquery stuff
[18:03:46] <shoky> then coding without jquery is not 'nice'
[18:03:54] <g0th> it is not up to me
[18:03:54] <shoky> accept it ;)
[18:03:59] <g0th> if it was I would use it immediately
[18:04:07] <raj> dojo 2012
[18:04:14] <g0th> my project depends on another project
[18:04:28] <g0th> but the other one behaves wrongly because it uses offsetLeft
[18:04:40] <g0th> so I asked them to change it to ...offset().left etc
[18:04:50] <g0th> but they say that they want to keep it jquery free
[18:05:33] <romsok> ok here it is
[18:05:34] <romsok> http://jsfiddle.net/C6fCs/
[18:06:09] <shoky> romsok, whats the prob
[18:06:49] <romsok>  var c_id = $(".ui-selected").attr("id"); this thing fails
[18:07:06] <romsok> console error cant get attribute of "undefined"
[18:07:40] <shoky> var c_id = $(".ui-selected").attr("id");
[18:07:40] <shoky>         alert("id: " + id);
[18:07:41] <romsok> now I look at the elements, and jquery definitely appends the class ui-selected to the <li>
[18:07:44] <shoky> you called it c_id
[18:07:47] <shoky> and then you reference 'id'
[18:09:17] <g0th> shoky: ok, so my guess is there is no easy way?
[18:09:27] <romsok> alright, that was dumb
[18:09:37] <romsok> wonder what the error on the console meant
[18:10:02] <romsok> I guess Jack Daniels and coding don't mix well
[18:10:20] <romsok> jk
[18:11:02] <coldhead> romsok: http://xkcd.com/323/
[18:15:49] <shoky> g0th, just had a look at the code
[18:15:55] <shoky> it doesn't seem complex at all
[18:17:23] <shoky> fairly straightforward
[18:17:35] <shoky> barely any dependency on other jquery functionality
[18:32:00] <raj> shoky, no luck
[18:32:04] <raj> i don't see what the issue is
[18:32:13] <raj> seems to me like it would work
[18:32:24] <shoky> do you see the .remove() being called..
[18:32:29] <raj> yes
[18:32:35] <shoky> on the correct object?
[18:32:41] <raj> although I'm not that adept at the stepwise stuff yet
[18:32:51] <raj> shoky, that I'm not sure about
[18:32:57] <raj> but the object is correct
[18:33:05] <raj> in that it contains Dogs and Cats
[18:33:09] <raj> so I presume it should be removed
[18:33:27] <raj> I haven't quite mastered the stepwise debugger though
[18:33:35] <raj> (i really need to get better at that to excel in js though)
[18:34:41] <shoky> i'll take a look
[18:34:59] <coldhead> raj: watch some videos on using the debugger
[18:35:04] <coldhead> you can learn the basics in like 5 minutes
[18:35:19] <raj> coldhead, can you suggest one?
[18:35:27] <coldhead> anything aul irish did, pretty much
[18:35:29] <raj> everyone I've seen just does the very basics that I already know
[18:35:29] <coldhead> paul*
[18:35:33] <raj> like where the script tab is
[18:36:34] <coldhead> this one seems to cover breakpoints et al
[18:36:36] <coldhead> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfm5u_JI2gk
[18:37:04] <coldhead> hey Davey!
[18:39:35] <coldhead> so cold
[18:39:37] <shoky> raj, $($higher_precedence_elems[i]).val()  is pretty convoluted, instead try:  $higher_precedence_elems.get(i).val()   ;p
[18:39:54] <coldhead> shoky++
[18:39:55] <shoky> sorry  .eq(i)
[18:40:19] <shoky> ah get is ok too
[18:41:27] <Whirl3d> raj, did you get your sort selector figured out.
[18:43:12] <shoky> raj
[18:43:20] <shoky> the problem is:  $("select[name='sortby_1']")
[18:43:28] <shoky> you're always cloning the first select box...
[18:45:20] <Whirl3d> Oh, wait a second... are you trying to make it so that you could chose to sort by : dog, then cat, then duck and then if you wanted to change any of them, they would only have the available options to sort by?
[18:45:55] <shoky> he's trying to make it so if you choose dogs then cats, then in the 3rd select box you wont have neither 'dogs' nor 'cats'
[18:46:06] <Whirl3d> I know, I made the one that works.
[18:46:16] <shoky> i see
[18:46:18] <Whirl3d> but the issue si that if you select dogs, cats, ducks
[18:46:37] <Whirl3d> and then want to change the order so Cats is in pos 1 no problem
[18:46:47] <Whirl3d> but then dogs is out of the race all together
[18:47:12] <Whirl3d> So each select field has to be updated each time a sort option is chosen/unchosen
[18:47:20] <shoky> yes, the design specifics should be worked out before writing any code ;p
[18:48:34] <Whirl3d> Still it wouldn't be that difficult to do. Any select field could simply apply the "active" or "hidden" classes to the same set of options every time something changes
[18:48:53] <shoky> wouldn't be difficult, no
[18:49:49] <Whirl3d> With my current model, you can easily select mice twice, for exanple
[18:50:18] <shoky> dunno, i was just tackling the problem as he presented it
[18:50:29] <shoky> tho i see now i was wrong about what the prob is
[18:50:40] <shoky> this code is much messier than it should be
[18:51:57] <coldhead> so terribly cold
[18:52:16] <shoky> yer head?
[18:53:30] <coldhead> amongst other parts
[19:00:01] <raj> shoky, sorry, got summoned to help bring some stuff in
[19:00:27] <raj> Whirl3d, yes to your question
[19:02:30] <raj> shoky, that code snippet from jsfiddle is the slimmed down version that just takes into account adding a box to the end
[19:02:38] <raj> what Whirl3d mentioned was my actual goal
[19:02:46] <raj> where it can only sort by what's remaining
[19:03:20] <raj> my full code tried tackling that goal http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/12/
[19:03:44] <raj> Whirl3d, I see that (at least for adding an additional sortbox) your code works, but i wasn't sure as to why mine didn't
[19:04:34] <Whirl3d> raj, to be honest, I looked at your code and couldn't figure out what you were trying to do or why you expected it to work or not work.
[19:04:42] <raj> really?
[19:04:44] <raj> hmm
[19:05:14] <raj> Whirl3d, this is the slimmed down version of mine http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/3/
[19:06:18] <shoky> i'll clean your code up some so we can figure out what you're trying to do ;p
[19:06:28] <raj> omg, it's that bad?
[19:06:39] <raj> I tried commenting it to be clear too, shesh
[19:06:42] <raj> *sheesh
[19:13:34] <Lonestar99> good evening --> what does the following do?  $("#nx").click();  If id nx is clicked then???
[19:13:47] <raj> nothing
[19:13:58] <raj> or might simulate a click
[19:14:08] <raj> actually, I think that's what it does
[19:14:08] <Whirl3d> Listen, kid. If you thought I meant that to hurt your feelings, you need to spend about 5 minutes in "timeout" in the #CSS channel. I didn't mean any offense,
[19:14:22] <Lonestar99> lol
[19:15:01] <shoky> raj
[19:15:02] <Lonestar99> raj:  what i am looking for is when id nx is clicked then ....
[19:15:10] <shoky> while cleaning your code i may have accidentally fixed it :P
[19:15:21] <shoky> i swear i didn't mean to :)
[19:15:22] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/4/
[19:15:29] <shoky> just wanted to clean it
[19:15:38] <shoky> less for loops, more .each()
[19:15:39] <coldhead> Lonestar99: somewhere in the code there is probably a callback function that tells the browser exactly what to do when that element is clicked
[19:15:44] <coldhead> you need to find tha tcode
[19:15:53] <coldhead> and if that code doesn't exist then there is no callback
[19:15:59] <coldhead> and click() does nothing
[19:16:53] <raj> shoky, just changing for loops to .each fixed it?
[19:16:54] <Lonestar99> coldhead so I must use --> $("#nx").click(function() { ... }  ??
[19:17:26] <shoky> raj, probably because your code was unneccesarily convoluted you had some small bug
[19:17:33] <shoky> that automagically fixed by doing things cleaner
[19:17:39] <raj> hmm
[19:17:59] <coldhead> Lonestar99: http://jsfiddle.net/NgZD5/
[19:18:04] <coldhead> yes
[19:18:38] <shoky> raj you called .find() too many times, probably one of the times it gave you something you weren't expecting
[19:18:47] <raj> oh
[19:18:56] <raj> so .each was better cuz then you were able to use $(this) ?
[19:19:01] <shoky> yeah
[19:19:16] <shoky> also no need for sloppy indexes
[19:19:21] <raj> right
[19:19:29] <raj> ok, so note-to-self, use .each instead of for loops
[19:19:49] <shoky> first read ;)
[19:19:50] <shoky> ?each
[19:19:50] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:19:51] <raj> someone told me to only use .each if I need closure
[19:20:04] <raj> otherwise use forloops
[19:20:14] <Whirl3d> for loops can be faster
[19:20:35] <shoky> make it faster after it works
[19:20:40] <raj> word
[19:20:40] <caniuse> raj: bond
[19:20:49] <raj> NICE
[19:21:26] <Lonestar99> coldhead this what I am trying to accomplish --> http://pastebin.com/jQy8PjWs
[19:22:07] <coldhead> why don't you use TWO functions, Lonestar99
[19:22:09] <coldhead> one for each case
[19:22:15] <coldhead> rather than one tricky gomblicated function
[19:22:20] <raj> shoky, so is my approach to selection changes for boxes that have already been established okay?
[19:22:24] <Whirl3d> code still doesn't work, shoky
[19:22:33] <Whirl3d> you can select horses twice
[19:22:52] <Lonestar99> coldhead:  was actually thinking, that just was not sure if it was the best way
[19:23:03] <raj> Whirl3d, you mean if an option is changed?
[19:23:05] <VioByte> i suck at regex so can anyone tell me the expression to find "apple" in something like "doyouwantanappletoeat"?
[19:23:25] <Whirl3d> I selected DOGS, then HOrses, then changed 1 to horses
[19:23:31] <Whirl3d> shouldn've have been able to do that
[19:23:37] <Whirl3d> horses was already taken
[19:24:09] <raj> right
[19:24:10] <Whirl3d> I would actually use one set of options, ,then an input field
[19:24:25] <coldhead> Lonestar99: here is the way you are trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/Q8na2/
[19:24:33] <Whirl3d> when the input field recieves focus, swap it out with a dynamically created Select field with only the available options
[19:24:35] <coldhead> see how it's got all this e.target bollocks
[19:24:46] <coldhead> that's jQuery's way of telling you to simplify
[19:24:50] <coldhead> functions should do one thing well
[19:24:54] <raj> not sure what you mean Whirl3d
[19:24:59] <coldhead> just have more functions
[19:25:11] <Whirl3d> working it up in a fiddle now
[19:25:15] <Lonestar99> coldhead:  ok thanks  will try it in a bit, thanks
[19:25:24] <coldhead> good luck Lonestar99
[19:26:28] <Lonestar99> thank you
[19:26:48] <shoky> raj honestly i didn't really understand your higher_precedence_elems table
[19:26:53] <coldhead> NEWSPAPER FACSIMILE
[19:27:29] <raj> shoky, it's so I can assess what options I need to remove
[19:27:44] <coldhead> you have a great nick, shoky
[19:27:48] <coldhead> i enjoy it everytime i see it
[19:27:51] <shoky> thank u
[19:28:00] <shoky> im so glad it gives you sensual pleasure
[19:28:17] <shoky> though i usually go by antishok
[19:28:18] <coldhead> i didn't say sensual
[19:28:22] <shoky> so
[19:28:27] <coldhead> it's more cerebral
[19:28:39] <shoky> are you high
[19:28:40] <coldhead> like knowing that someone owes you a lot of money
[19:28:53] <owen1>   $('.replies td.delete').live('hover', invite.handlerIn, invite.handlerOut);
[19:28:54] <coldhead> no, i have nearological disease
[19:28:57] <shoky> oh nice
[19:29:01] <shoky> i'm pretty high
[19:29:05] <coldhead> respect
[19:29:08] <raj> nice shoky
[19:29:11] <coldhead> stoners are good people
[19:29:12] <owen1> handlerIn is not doing anything. any ideas?
[19:29:16] <coldhead> except those wife beating ones
[19:29:26] <coldhead> or rap "artists"
[19:29:33] <shoky> they ain't true to the bud
[19:31:56] <owen1> i have issue with live.   $('.replies td.delete').live('hover', invite.handlerIn, invite.handlerOut);
[19:32:00] <owen1> is not working..
[19:32:11] <shoky> it give eror
[19:33:17] <coldhead> can you be more specific owen1 ?
[19:33:41] <shoky> also, live is deprecated
[19:34:23] <coldhead> yah but it should still work
[19:34:26] <coldhead> baby steps, bro
[19:34:35] <coldhead> SHE DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE
[19:34:40] <shoky> is it live as in 'to live' or as in 'we're going live' ?
[19:35:24] <shoky> i need to know so i can pronounce it wholeheartedly in my head.
[19:35:25] <coldhead> both
[19:35:27] <shoky> DAMN YOU
[19:35:29] <coldhead> first one then the other
[19:35:36] <StevenCodes22> lol
[19:36:44] <shoky> stackoverflow has this to say about it
[19:36:45] <tash1> http://pastie.org/3669392 If the conditional on line 17 is true, I'm alerting "Successfully added!", but I'd also like to close the dialog form ... so I tried putting $( this ).dialog( "close" ); right under line 19 and it doesn't close the dialog.  Anyone have any tips?
[19:36:45] <shoky> I would guess (and I do pronounce it as) live as in the verb, so it rhymes with div. This is because the opposite of .live() is .die(), which is also a verb (likewise with .bind() versus .unbind()).
[19:36:57] <shoky> EDIT [4/5]: according to this blog post from a couple years back (thanks James Padolsey), Brandon Aaron (an ex-contributor to jQuery) said it's live as in "live broadcast
[19:37:10] <shoky> so you're goddamn right coldhead
[19:37:21] <shoky> right and cold
[19:37:30] <owen1> coldhead: let me try .on('hover', functionA, functionB) instead
[19:37:48] <shoky> owen, and jsfiddle it
[19:37:54] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/ - I'm trying to do this slideshow presentation of some external HTML pages - can somebody please point me in the right direction?
[19:38:22] <Whirl3d> you can't namespace focus?
[19:39:01] <mikkelb> It's for some HTML draft designs I've been doing for this large site and I'm looking for the most convenient way to present them.
[19:39:08] <min|dvir|us1> Hi. When I type text and then delete it, the element disappears from the DOM. http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/
[19:39:34] <shoky> what element
[19:39:40] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: #text
[19:40:34] <shoky> what makes you say that
[19:40:49] <shoky> it's still there.. you just changed its text
[19:40:57] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: did you delete it?
[19:41:04] <shoky> yes
[19:41:14] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: when you remove all the text, the element doesn't disappear?
[19:41:27] <shoky> the random text?
[19:41:31] <min|dvir|us1> http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/1/
[19:41:32] <shoky> it's still there
[19:41:34] <min|dvir|us1> No.
[19:41:38] <min|dvir|us1> OK, look.
[19:41:42] <shoky> LOOKING
[19:41:43] <min|dvir|us1> Type text, then delete it all.
[19:41:54] <shoky> did it.
[19:42:00] <min|dvir|us1> Element is gone?
[19:42:05] <shoky> the random text which is in #text element still appears.
[19:42:11] <min|dvir|us1> Not for me.
[19:42:17] <shoky> the random text disappears?
[19:42:27] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: #text is no longer a part of the DOM.
[19:42:33] <shoky> what makes you say that :)
[19:42:54] <shoky> Ok, look.
[19:42:56] <shoky> you did:
[19:42:56] <shoky>  $('#text')
[19:42:56] <shoky>                         .text(getRandomText(prng, 4, 6))
[19:43:11] <shoky> which put the random text into the #text element............
[19:43:12] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: you seem incompetent.
[19:43:14] <shoky> haha
[19:43:26] <shoky> why dont you answer my question?
[19:43:35] <shoky> if you're so competent
[19:43:46] <raj> wow, that's rude
[19:43:48] <shoky> what makes you say that #text is no longer a part of the DOM?
[19:43:53] <min|dvir|us1> Does anyone know why #text disappears after typing text into #password, then deleting it? http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/1/
[19:43:57] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/3/ - I'm trying to do a slideshow presentation of some external HTML pages - but what am I missing?
[19:44:29] <shoky> min, ITS STILL A PART OF THE DOM
[19:44:41] <shoky> i am checking the DOM in chrome
[19:44:44] <shoky> it's still there
[19:44:45] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: not on my screen. Are you sure you're looking at the new link?
[19:45:00] <shoky> min|dvir|us1, does the random text disappear OR NOT?
[19:45:05] <shoky> why cant you answer a simple questions
[19:45:05] <owen1>  $('.replies td.delete').live('hover', invite.handlerIn, invite.handlerOut); this doesn't work on a tr that i inject into the page.
[19:45:08] <shoky> -s
[19:45:17] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: Quite obviously the text disappears.
[19:45:21] <min|dvir|us1> If the DOM element is gone the text is gone.
[19:45:29] <min|dvir|us1> Stop asking me questions I've already answered.
[19:45:35] <shoky> in the new link it disappears, yes
[19:45:39] <shoky> in the old one, no
[19:46:03] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: yes, my mistake.
[19:46:12] <shoky> no shit
[19:46:22] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: your mistake for asking retarded questions.
[19:46:28] <mikkelb> getting some bad vibes off min|dvir|us1 here
[19:46:33] <shoky> no mistake on my part
[19:46:39] <raj> Whirl3d, any luck getting it to work even for changes in existing choices?
[19:46:42] <owen1>  $('.replies td.delete').on('mouseenter', invite.handlerIn); this doesn't work as well
[19:46:49] <min|dvir|us1> mikkelb: same from you. :)
[19:47:01] <mikkelb> from me, ive barely said anything
[19:47:10] <min|dvir|us1> Anyhow, any thoughts?
[19:47:24] <shoky> thoughts?
[19:47:30] <mikkelb> min|dvir|us1: your life must really be shit judging by the way you treat other people
[19:47:32] <Whirl3d> Yeah. It's too messy
[19:47:36] <shoky> why do you wan't to hear our thoughts
[19:47:38] <Whirl3d> I would approach the problem differently
[19:47:43] <shoky> incompetent bunch that we are
[19:47:54] <min|dvir|us1> shoky: because I have a problem that I need to solve. If you don't have any thoughts, thanks anyway!
[19:48:11] <raj> Whirl3d, how so?
[19:48:47] <Whirl3d> I would make it a two step process ...click a button to add a level of sort complexity, then the select appears
[19:48:48] <raj> Whirl3d, in this version I tried addressing that http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/12/
[19:49:10] <min|dvir|us1> Seems like .replaceAll() is malfunctioning, or I'm understanding how it works incorrectly. http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/1/
[19:49:17] <min|dvir|us1> (I've also tried .replaceWith().)
[19:49:53] <Lonestar99> why does --> var nxx = (bs + 1);  equal 01 and not 1 ?
[19:50:04] <min|dvir|us1> Lonestar99: almost surely because bs is a string.
[19:50:05] <Eviltwin> Lonestar99: Probably because bs is "0" not 0
[19:50:17] <Lonestar99> k that is what i thought
[19:50:22] <Lonestar99> ok let me fix that
[19:50:22] <Whirl3d> and then I think you should have all of your sort options should be checkboxes
[19:50:33] <Whirl3d> or radio buttons
[19:50:36] <raj> why?
[19:50:50] <Whirl3d> just to make it more difficult from both ends
[19:51:01] <raj> huh?
[19:51:04] <shoky> min|dvir|us1
[19:51:05] <Whirl3d> No, then you wouldn't have to worry about removing the elements each time
[19:51:06] <shoky> ?replaceAll
[19:51:07] <bot-t> .replaceAll(target): Replace each target element with the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/replaceAll/
[19:51:11] <shoky> there you go
[19:51:19] <raj> Whirl3d, but select boxes are the UI i'd like
[19:51:21] <shoky> oh.
[19:51:22] <shoky> sorry
[19:51:48] <Whirl3d> Maybe create a class that you can apply to the selected options that hides them
[19:52:04] <raj> how is that any different though?
[19:52:05] <Whirl3d> and on change, apply the selected class to all options
[19:52:14] <raj> than .remove()
[19:53:11] <min|dvir|us1> Does anyone know why #text disappears from the DOM after typing text into #password, then deleting it? http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/1/ Ctrl+F "replaceAll".
[19:53:25] <Whirl3d> cause it would still be there, you just couldn't select it
[19:53:43] <Whirl3d> then to re-add it, just remove the selected class from all options
[19:55:20] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us1: How about this? http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/2/
[19:56:59] <min|dvir|us1> Eviltwin: doesn't retain the font. No matter -- is there no way to use replaceAll/replaceWith?
[19:57:46] <raj> Whirl3d, I think I'd run into the same issues, no?
[19:59:09] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us1: I think it's because render runs twice and you end up replacing the element with itself
[20:00:03] <min|dvir|us1> Eviltwin: it doesn't run twice.
[20:00:33] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/6/ - I'm trying to do a slideshow presentation of some external HTML pages - but what am I missing?
[20:01:17] <min|dvir|us1> Eviltwin: also, either way, it's the clone.
[20:01:58] <min|dvir|us1> Hmm.
[20:02:08] <min|dvir|us1> $originalText doesn't seem to actually be a clone.
[20:02:36] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us1: http://jsfiddle.net/AAkkc/3/
[20:02:43] <Eviltwin> It is a clone
[20:02:53] <Eviltwin> However this runs once with it empty right at the start
[20:02:59] <Eviltwin> At which point var isPasswordEmpty = !prng; is true
[20:03:14] <Eviltwin> At which point $originalText.replaceAll('#text'); puts the clone in the DOM in place of what was there
[20:03:31] <shoky> min|dvir|us1, when you replace it with $originalText then you're putting $originalText on the DOM. then when you do $originalText.replaceAll($('#text')) y
[20:03:34] <shoky> yea i was just typing that ;p
[20:03:41] <optraz> i want to altered a <p> text, what method should I use?
[20:04:29] <min|dvir|us1> Eviltwin: I'm not following.
[20:04:33] <shoky> it's like calling $('#text').replaceAll($('#text'))
[20:04:35] <Eviltwin> optraz: Use .text() to get the text then .text(...) to substitute a replacement
[20:04:48] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us1: So let's call what's in the DOM at load "A"
[20:04:51] <min|dvir|us1> Eviltwin: I saw all you added  was .clone().
[20:04:53] <Eviltwin> And the clone "B"
[20:04:56] <min|dvir|us1> OK.
[20:04:57] <Eviltwin> When this code runs
[20:05:00] <Eviltwin> "B" gets created
[20:05:07] <Eviltwin> And is an honest to god clone of the element
[20:05:12] <min|dvir|us1> Right.
[20:05:17] <Eviltwin> Then you call .passcasso(...)
[20:05:23] <min|dvir|us1> Right.
[20:05:40] <Eviltwin> Either when you click inside or maybe right when it gets initialized, the render method runs
[20:05:45] <Eviltwin> With an empty password
[20:05:54] <Eviltwin> At which point var isPasswordEmpty = !prng; is true
[20:06:04] <Eviltwin> At which point $originalText.replaceAll('#text'); runs
[20:06:14] <Eviltwin> Because $originalText represents an honest to god element
[20:06:32] <Eviltwin> It puts that actual element ("B") in the DOM at that location
[20:06:37] <Eviltwin> And removes the original ("A")
[20:06:46] <Eviltwin> Now because it has id="text"
[20:06:53] <raj> Whirl3d, just in playing with classes, seems exactly the same really
[20:06:58] <Eviltwin> And it's in the document
[20:07:07] <Eviltwin> All of your $("#text")'s now refer to "B"
[20:07:10] <raj> i'm just replacing .remove() with .addClass()
[20:07:20] <optraz> Eviltwin: okay, to get the text of <p>, we get it using $("#foo p").text(); ?
[20:07:22] <mikkelb> yo Eviltwin could i borrow u for a quick sec?
[20:07:27] <min|dvir|us1> Eviltwin: OK, gotcha.
[20:07:29] <Eviltwin> At which point $originalText.replaceAll("#text") puts "B" right after "B" and then removes "B"
[20:07:38] <Eviltwin> optraz: Yes
[20:07:49] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: Just ask your question
[20:10:41] <Whirl3d> raj, this seems like the kind of thing that would really not be as useful in an end product as the amount of time it takes to solve it. EvilTwin could do it in his sleep, but honestly, I don't want to spend any more time on something I'll never use...but only because I am way behind on a deadline.
[20:11:24] <raj> k, no prob, thanks for looking
[20:13:54] <shoky> raj want me to take a look?
[20:14:14] <raj> please do :)
[20:14:20] <shoky> i'd need the most recent link ;p
[20:14:21] <raj> i'm getting no where with my code
[20:14:29] <shoky> or an old one ;p
[20:14:31] <romsok> could someone please point to a code example of a Jquery UI Dialog: capturing the button pressed and making an ajax call?
[20:14:50] <raj> shoky, this is what worked when you fixed it with .each http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/4/
[20:15:06] <shoky> ok and explain what you want to achieve
[20:15:18] <shoky> i wasn't following
[20:15:30] <raj> I want for a selected option to be removed from the next box that shows
[20:15:43] <shoky> from the next? from all others?
[20:16:26] <raj> if an option is Changed in a box that already had an option selected, it should remove any box that is later to it (lower precedence) and remove that option from any of the other boxes that are lower precedence
[20:16:28] <shoky> what should happen when you select an option that you already selected
[20:16:31] <shoky> o
[20:16:53] <raj> the top most box has the highest precedence, btw
[20:16:55] <shoky> and should options re-appear..?
[20:17:14] <raj> yeah, options should reappear if higher precedence boxes no longer have that option chosen
[20:17:20] <tash1> I'm making an ajax call to insert something into the DB, and I want my page to reload, how can I do that?
[20:17:24] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: cool thanks
[20:17:26] <shoky> ok that was worth mentioning ;p
[20:17:32] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/6/ - I'm trying to do a slideshow presentation of some external HTML pages - but what am I missing?
[20:17:57] <raj> this is my non-working code that tried accomplishing that http://jsfiddle.net/wWUdf/12/
[20:18:29] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: Well this is really a jQuery Cycle Plugin question, not a jQuery question
[20:18:31] <shoky> <raj> if an option is Changed in a box that already had an option selected, it should remove any box that is later to it (lower precedence) and remove that option from any of the other boxes that are lower precedence
[20:18:38] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: I would suggest starting here: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/faq.html
[20:18:42] <shoky> it should remove boxes?
[20:18:45] <Eviltwin> Make sure you've seen everything there
[20:18:46] <shoky> or options?
[20:18:47] <shoky> or both?
[20:19:18] <raj> both
[20:19:38] <shoky> if it removes the boxes, how can you remove options from them?
[20:19:42] <raj> so if a higher precedence box changes it's option to, say, Mice (where it was originally Horses)
[20:19:46] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: isn't Cycle just for the sliding itself? All the other stuff like loading the external HTML page, get the paginator going etc. aren't those more general jQuery questions?
[20:19:51] <raj> if Mice was already selected in a lower precedence box
[20:19:55] <raj> that box should be removed
[20:20:04] <shoky> ok you did not mention that either
[20:20:14] <raj> and Mice should be removed from the options of any of the lower precedence boxes
[20:20:20] <raj> and horses should be added back in
[20:20:40] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: While you have 5 tiny lines of JavaScript, there's 1500 lines of JavaScript in that plugin
[20:20:45] <Eviltwin> And I've never used it before myself
[20:20:50] <someprimetime> is there a more efficient way of doing this: $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().find('#js-liked-comment');
[20:20:59] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: see ?closest
[20:21:07] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: that didn't work
[20:21:20] <Eviltwin> If it's actually a fixed number of parents you're looking for, you're probably doing something horribly wrong in your HTML structure
[20:21:25] <mikkelb> Cool, thanks man
[20:21:58] <someprimetime> eh it's not that bad.. i'm inside a <ul> and i'm looking for another <ul> outside of the current one but all contained within the same parent div
[20:22:00] <shoky> raj do you care if it is efficient or not ?
[20:22:10] <raj> preferrably yes? :)
[20:22:21] <raj> what's inefficient?
[20:23:01] <shoky> i mean, the easiest way would be to run over all lower-precedence select-boxes and put all original options in them and then remove the ones needed to be removed
[20:23:02] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Well I can tell you that closest works as advertized
[20:23:07] <someprimetime> lol
[20:23:07] <Eviltwin> Have you looked at what it advertizes?
[20:23:16] <someprimetime> yeah that's why i tried using it earlier
[20:23:20] <someprimetime> maybe my html is messed up.
[20:23:27] <Eviltwin> Quite possibly
[20:23:33] <raj> shoky, that seems fine
[20:23:36] <shoky> ok
[20:23:42] <raj> what would the alternative be anyway?
[20:23:57] <raj> cuz that's what i was doing in my crappy, non-working code
[20:24:45] <shoky> the alternative would be to only re-add the options that are missing
[20:25:17] <raj> oh
[20:25:25] <shoky> if it was huge selectboxes with N options.. then it would matter :P
[20:25:32] <raj> nope, it isn't
[20:25:36] <shoky> so i figured
[20:34:32] <raj> shoky, the name is supposed to change too, like if a box is removed, so that the ordered naming stays consecutive (that was the one thing my code actually worked in doing)
[20:38:13] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky HAY Y AREN'T YOU HERE
[20:38:19] <abjorn> where's bot-t :(
[20:38:30] <abjorn> :'(
[20:38:55] <raj> he was here
[20:40:40] <mushin> could someone please help me figure out how i can get this script to return the browser width as 390px less than it actually is? http://pastebin.com/y4S8mbT8
[20:41:57] <mushin> have tried and failed a lot and would be super thankful if someone could help out :)
[20:42:55] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/6/ - I'm trying to use jQuery Cycle to present some designs I did. But how do I load entire HTML pages into each <li>?
[20:46:02] <Lonestar99> how do i convert -1 which is a string into a number ??
[20:46:55] <Lonestar99> parseFloat only works with positive "number" strings
[20:46:57] <raj> parseInt()
[20:47:18] <raj> if it's an integer
[20:47:58] <Lonestar99> k let me try that
[20:49:41] <shoky> well raj, this is what ive done so far http://jsfiddle.net/Yyvbg/6/
[20:49:58] <shoky> i think its enough for me right now ;) doesnt work too good yet
[20:50:11] <shoky> because it resets the selection on lower boxes
[20:50:16] <shoky> but you can fiddle with that
[20:50:27] <shoky> (and i didnt update the ordinal text)
[20:51:35] <raj> shoky, i don't see what's wrong with it
[20:51:39] <raj> besides the ordinal text
[20:51:42] <shoky> with mine?
[20:51:55] <raj> ya
[20:52:06] <raj> oh, I see, if a box is removed, things don't fix
[20:52:42] <raj> wait, yes they do
[20:52:46] <raj> so what's wrong with it?
[20:52:59] <shoky> no the prob is that it resets the selected option on lower boxes if you change the selection on an upper one
[20:53:12] <shoky> if you select cats in the 3rd box
[20:53:19] <raj> oh, right
[20:53:21] <shoky> then change the selection on the 1st box to whatever (not cats)
[20:53:43] <shoky> it happens cause i copied over all the options ffrom the original
[20:53:49] <shoky> but its easy to fix
[21:01:39] <abjorn> coldhead!
[21:03:04] <hobs> coldhead.
[21:04:03] <dr0id> coldhead,
[21:04:50] <hobs> coldhead;
[21:04:51] <coldhead> wat
[21:04:59] <coldhead> brb: nosebleed
[21:05:00] <hobs> I just like saying your name
[21:06:13] <kzoo> is there a way which i can re-initialize jquery event bindings after if i add a new clickable element to a page?
[21:06:25] <coldhead> likewise, hobsy, respect
[21:08:58] <Lonestar99> when i am ready to distribute my jquery code how is the best way to compress or encode, so no common user will mess with the code?
[21:10:08] <Lonestar99> something like min versions of jquery codebase...
[21:11:44] <klocatelli> you could shove it through closure compiler
[21:12:27] <Lonestar99> klocatelli: ok will look into that. thanks
[21:12:47] <martisj> klocatelli: what is closure compiler?
[21:13:39] <klocatelli> https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/
[21:14:32] <klocatelli> part of google's closure tools project
[21:16:16] <Lonestar99> is this the same thing --> http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
[21:17:37] <klocatelli> yes and no
[21:17:56] <klocatelli> that's for compiling a single file (the text field)
[21:19:21] <klocatelli> but if you want more advanced things like dependency checking/loading or using the closure library (which is a bit redundant if you're using jquery) or other things, you need the CLI
[21:19:41] <klocatelli> but you probably don't need or want those things, so...
[21:19:43] <Lonestar99> klocatelli:  ok, cause that web service compiler did not work lol
[21:19:54] <klocatelli> what do you mean did not work?
[21:21:02] <Lonestar99> klocatelli: or the appspot link compiler did not work for me,gonna try your link
[21:24:48] <Lonestar99> klocatelli:  http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home --> whitespace --> works
