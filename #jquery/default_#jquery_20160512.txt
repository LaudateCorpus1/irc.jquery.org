[00:07:51] <urmal_> jonez, I figured out what the issue was.  AJAX was never sending POST data to the PHP file for some reason when I was using serialize()
[00:08:13] <urmal_> not sure what to attribute it to, but manually grabbing values seems to have done it for me.
[00:08:47] <jonez> urmal_, cool
[00:08:59] <jonez> perhaps after a while you will be able to optimize the code a bit
[00:09:16] <urmal_> jonez, indeed.  thank you very much for helping me.  you are very kind :)
[00:09:25] <jonez> (I have js which I know can be much better written, but it works so I leave it alone)
[00:09:39] <jonez> urmal_, np, happy to help :)
[02:53:55] <Gore> hi, i have span id="xxx" span span, how can can I select _only_ the middle one?
[02:54:19] <Gore> $('#xxx span') gives me both
[02:56:26] <jerit> Gore try <span id="xxx"><span class="select-this-one"><span class="the-other-one">
[02:56:39] <jerit> then select $('#xxx .select-this-one')
[02:57:02] <Gore> can´t, it´s amazon + greasemonkey
[02:58:24] <jerit> $('#xxx span:first-child')
[02:59:06] <Gore> tried, oddly enough I got an empty string there
[02:59:09] <Gore> :/
[02:59:21] <jerit> $('#xxx span:first-child').val()
[02:59:21] <jerit> ?
[02:59:30] <jerit> you're not really being clear as to what you're trying to do
[02:59:40] <jerit> so its difficult to help you to achieve it
[02:59:58] <Gore> http://i.imgur.com/MMewTt7.png
[03:00:09] <Gore> I want "         Anthology: 1980-2005 (2CD)"
[03:04:20] <jerit> $('#xxx span:first-child').html()
[03:04:57] <jerit> Gore note that calling .html() will also give you the 3rd span as well so you need to work out how to strip that out
[03:05:15] <Gore> yeah, that´s basicly my problem
[03:05:55] <jerit> Gore https://jsfiddle.net/4v346f1x/
[03:06:38] <jerit> you could substring the output so that it only outputs everything until the next span. html() returns the contents as a text string so should be relatively simple
[03:07:43] <Gore> doesn´t need substr a length, I don´t have that
[03:08:01] <SledgeSRV> hey guys i have a div that is loaded with jax. inside that div is a form that i want to select using jquery. how do i correctly select that form by id?
[03:08:24] <SledgeSRV> ajax not jax lol
[03:11:11] <jerit> Gore use .indexOf() as in this paste https://jsfiddle.net/4v346f1x/1/
[03:11:52] <jerit> you can .indexOf('<span') to get an accurate look
[03:12:21] <SledgeDJ> hey guys i have a div that is loaded with ajax. inside that div is a form that i want to select using jquery. how do i correctly select that form by id? thnks in advance.
[03:13:28] <jerit> SledgeDJ are you really using 2 users to ask the same question?
[03:13:53] <SledgeDJ> got booted from server
[03:14:05] <Gore> jerit saved the day thank you
[03:14:22] <SledgeDJ> see...
[03:14:24] <SledgeDJ> :-)
[03:14:35] <jerit> SledgeDJ okay well can you show me some html? Without knowing the rendered html in the div its hard to say
[03:15:21] <jerit> SledgeDJ initially I'd opt for a $('div#ajax form') selector
[03:24:20] <SledgeDJ> jerit: http://jsbin.com/deloxepado/edit?html,output    everything inside .cart is inserted with ajax. the form i want to select it #qty-form so i can do ajax form submission on qty change
[03:27:03] <iateadonut> i'm trying to change the attr('href') of $('.class').  how can i say $(this) within a class?
[03:28:34] <iateadonut> for example, href='something' , so i want to change it to 'something#hash'
[03:28:52] <jerit> holy crap nuggets SledgeDJ what even is that nesting
[03:29:20] <iateadonut> i tried this:  $('.something').attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + '#something');
[03:29:26] <SledgeDJ> jerit: ya someone else cretted this html it is a mess
[03:29:30] <iateadonut> i'm wondering what that $(this) should be instead
[03:30:06] <SledgeDJ> jerit: i will probablly clean it up soon but first i need to be able to select this form
[03:31:11] <jerit> iateadonut you're trying to change <a class="something" href=""> to <a class="something" href="#something"> ?
[03:31:40] <baako> shocky
[03:32:00] <iateadonut> <a class="something" href="href1"> to <a class="something" href="href1#something">
[03:32:01] <iateadonut> and
[03:32:01] <iateadonut> <a class="something" href="href2"> to <a class="something" href="href2#something">
[03:33:11] <jerit> SledgeDJ I think you can get away with $('.cart #qty-form')
[03:33:35] <jerit> You can try being more specific too $('.cart form#qty-form')
[03:34:47] <jerit> iateadonut $('a.something').attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + '#something')
[03:35:08] <jerit> if that doesn't work, explicitly specify $('a.something').attr('href', $('a.something').attr('href') + '#something')
[03:35:45] <iateadonut> i treid the first one; the second one won't work i think
[03:36:12] <jerit> why won't it work? The attribute hasn't been changed yet
[03:36:27] <iateadonut> because each instance of the class has one.
[03:36:29] <iateadonut> i'll try it
[03:37:48] <iateadonut> the second one changes all the hrefs to href1#something
[03:39:20] <iateadonut> i think i just have to use .each in order to use $(this).
[03:39:37] <jerit> sounds like a plan yeah
[03:41:00] <SledgeDJ> jerit: thanks
[03:41:41] <jerit> ^^
[04:02:35] <FilipNortic> $('#statscategorytable').find("tr:gt(0)").remove();
[04:02:49] <FilipNortic> does this remove all but the first row in a table?
[04:07:08] <AdamPDotty> yep
[05:48:06] <Gore> what does this do: $("span", $('#container').html()
[05:48:13] <Gore> )
[05:49:55] <nxplus> Gore: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[05:51:00] <Gore> $("span", $('#container').html())  it´s a selector or not?
[05:52:00] <nxplus> it adds the html content of the element with id container to all span elements
[05:52:29] <Gore> puhh, thanks
[05:56:36] <Gore> nxplus where is this documented?
[05:57:01] <Gore> expected it here: https://api.jquery.com/element-selector/
[06:00:55] <nxplus> Gore: sorry I missed something.. I believe this is what you want: $("span").html($('#container').html())
[06:00:56] <nxplus> ?
[06:01:33] <Gore> nope, I want to know what $("span", $('#container').html()) exactly means and where I can find that in the documentation
[06:01:41] <AdamPDotty> The expression looks for a span inside the selector given by container's html.
[06:01:58] <AdamPDotty> risky business
[06:02:38] <Gore> I want to understand this: http://technify.me/user-experience/javascript/jquery/remove-an-element-from-an-html-string-with-jquery/
[06:02:48] <Gore> and how he got to the expression
[06:03:04] <AdamPDotty> Should be the same as $($('container').html()).find('span')
[06:03:04] <Gore> $("span", theString)
[06:04:20] <nxplus> Gore: see answer of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2672034/multiple-parameters-for-jquery-selector
[06:04:56] <Gore> ah, undocumented then I guess :o
[06:05:00] <AdamPDotty> Might even be the same as $('#container').children('span').
[06:05:39] <AdamPDotty> Not sure about differences there.
[06:05:44] <Gore> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery1
[06:05:53] <Gore> jQuery( selector [, context ] )
[06:05:59] <Gore> thanks
[06:51:18] <rollingWolf> SOmeone has any idea why a bunch of jquery addons all of a sudden would stop working and claiming uncaught typeerror $(...).<name> is not a function?
[06:51:38] <rollingWolf> jquery works, and datatables work, but thats about it
[06:52:16] <shoky> rollingWolf: my first guess would be that you've included jquery twice
[06:52:36] <rollingWolf> shoky, Ok sec let me check that
[06:52:37] <shoky> e.g. you included it again when including datatables, or something
[06:53:16] <rollingWolf> shoky, Right, I see ehre that jquery 2.2.0 hjas been included in the dataables js .. Thanks :)
[06:53:22] <shoky> :)
[06:53:37] <rollingWolf>  * Included libraries:
[06:53:39] <rollingWolf>  *   jQuery 2.2.0, DataTables 1.10.11, Responsive 2.0.2
[06:53:47] <rollingWolf> Cheers ^^ have an awesome day
[06:56:34] <rollingWolf> shoky, Ok back, downloaded a fresh datatables.min.js without jquery this time still the same error ...
[07:01:57] <shoky> rollingWolf: can't help without seeing a testcase/jsfiddle/code
[07:05:55] <rollingWolf> shoky, Figured as much :/
[07:06:33] <rollingWolf> shoky, Ive gone through all JS files thats large enough for the possibility to contain jquery without anything turning up :/
[07:07:02] <shoky> does removing datatables completely fix the errors for the other plugins?
[07:07:15] <rollingWolf> shoky, Good one
[07:07:39] <rollingWolf> no it didnt
[07:08:11] <shoky> figure out what else you changed :S
[07:08:57] <SledgeDJ>  jerit: you still around?
[07:09:07] <rollingWolf> shoky, Yea Im backtracking
[07:10:10] <jerit> SledgeDJ am now
[07:10:14] <jerit> sorry, got DC'd
[07:13:18] <rollingWolf> shoky, Completerandomness
[07:14:36] <SledgeDJ> jerit: experiencing somethign very odd... the form is submiting and is working as the quantity changes but the ajax form is failing. I d not get success. i think it is coming back blank. an ideas?
[07:15:38] <rollingWolf> shoky, I saved after each change to see if it worked. I tried changing .fullCalendar  (one of the functions that didnt work) to .fullcalendar and then back to .fullCalendar which made it work again . but whats really weird is that it suddenly started working on another page i hadnt edited on yet that was bokring a couple of minutes ago
[07:15:43] <rollingWolf> shoky, Complete randomness
[07:15:59] <rollingWolf> borking*
[07:16:51] <rollingWolf> lets see of datepicker works them
[07:17:06] <rollingWolf> yes
[07:19:13] <SledgeDJ> jerit: any ideas?
[07:29:24] <jerit> SledgeDJ can't really say without knowing what the form does with the data or how it behaves after its done that
[07:30:29] <jerit> Does it post to an MVC controller? Does it submit to an API? Is the submission handled to return an HTTP Response Message on a Json Result? There's a lot to consider in troubleshooting this
[09:21:48] <merkazu> morning, is it possible to append text containing html entities literally to a div? ie, not transforming &amp; into & or &apos; into '
[09:22:08] <taplar> you can set text()
[09:22:48] <merkazu> i do need append, i don't want to override the entire div's content with it
[09:23:58] <shoky> so append with text()
[09:26:23] <merkazu> so $('#target').append(string.text())?
[09:26:42] <shoky> no. just use .text(), not .append()
[09:33:28] <taplar> actually append doesn't transform those.. https://jsfiddle.net/hpb0q54z/
[09:34:19] <shoky> uh it transformed them..?
[09:34:33] <taplar> ah, crap right
[09:34:57] <taplar> i was thinking the html was visible, not the & transforming
[09:37:05] <shoky> yah. anyways if he really has html in the div beforehand then just using text() won't work.. can .append() a span and fill the span with .text()
[09:37:56] <taplar> i'd agree, and then you don't have free floating content nodes, :)
[09:40:57] <taplar> booya, or go vanilla https://jsfiddle.net/hpb0q54z/1/
[09:41:59] <Gore> I select some stuff from a website, put it in a form I inject in the same website and post it to another website. All with greasemonkey. Now the other website throws an error because my content is not utf-8. How can jquery `help there?
[10:13:35] <Blinky_> Hi all, How do I select the html within the hidden_result element?
[10:14:39] <nxplus> Blinky_ : no different from selecting on a non-hidden element?
[10:14:58] <nxplus> since it is still in the dom
[10:19:05] <ahoo> $('.foocontrol', $(this))
[10:19:11] <ahoo> am i doing it right?
[10:19:37] <decx> you dont need to wrap this to set it as context
[10:20:08] <ahoo> i think i do
[10:20:15] <decx> no
[10:20:17] <ahoo> this code is in an event handler
[10:20:25] <decx> doesnt matter
[10:20:34] <ahoo> but this and $(this) are different things!
[10:20:53] <decx> they are but that doesnt matter for the context argument
[10:21:05] <ahoo> oh
[10:21:18] <ahoo> now i got it. thanks :)
[10:24:10] <_TWG_> Mornin everyone.
[10:26:46] <lilalinu_> Why doesn't ":selected" return the selected options?

[10:27:55] <prillian5> I have load jquery.mobile 1.4.5 after jquery1.11.2.
[10:28:12] <prillian5> on("click" work, on("tap" doesn't.
[10:28:15] <prillian5> Any Idea why?
[10:28:34] <prillian5> no errors thron in the browser-console
[10:29:11] <prillian5> This work: $('.textKachel').on("click",function(){console.log("test");});
[10:29:22] <prillian5> This don't : $('.textKachel').on("tap",function(){console.log("test");});
[10:31:58] <jose3_> Hello, I am using a plugin called formvalidation.io and something has gone awry. I am not entirely sure what it is, but I believe this is the offending code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/df806dcf8c960c1fa58d2256c6eeafb3 .
[10:31:58] <jose3_> For some reason, I have to click the submit button two times. Does anyone have any insight as to what might be causing this issue?
[10:32:19] <_TWG_> Please don't paste code directly in the chat.  Use pastebin or some other site for your code.
[10:32:55] <prillian5> _TWG_: oki doki
[10:38:36] <nxplus> _TWG_ : I'm assuming it's actually ok with short lines of code? (although perhaps that one was on the border)
[10:41:23] <_TWG_> Best rule of thumb is to always to use something like Pastebin as when the chat gets busy, it can get lost quickly.
[10:41:59] <nxplus> that's true, I agree
[10:42:46] <nxplus> prillian5 : why is it not working? is the tap supported?
[10:43:08] <prillian5> I don't know, I think so.
[10:43:18] <prillian5> jquery-mobile support it
[10:45:52] <nxplus> and you have load order: jquery.js then jquery-mobile.js ?
[10:46:32] <_TWG_> prillian5 try this http://kopy.io/0Mwzu
[10:48:17] <prillian5> nxplus: yes, load both. jquery-mobile is loaded .. .class ui-mobile is set for <html>
[10:48:44] <prillian5> _TWG_: not working. Maybe I try to trigger another element. One moment
[10:50:13] <AdamPDotty> hmpf, <iframe onload=""> works, where $('iframe').load() doesn't.
[10:54:11] <nxplus> AdamPDotty: does the iframe element exist at the load call?
[10:55:41] <AdamPDotty> yes, I alert iframe.length first
[10:57:08] <nxplus> hmm.. same in all browsers?
[10:59:06] <AdamPDotty> I just tried chrome https://jsfiddle.net/3Lat4r71/
[10:59:11] <AdamPDotty> lets see what else I got here
[10:59:48] <decx> it's easy
[10:59:58] <decx> jsfiddle puts your javascript in a window load
[11:00:04] <decx> by that time your iframe already did load
[11:01:33] <mohsen_> Hi
[11:01:50] <AdamPDotty> I thought .load fires instantly if it is attached after the load event.
[11:02:07] <mohsen_> Is it okay to put jquery scripts outside <head>?
[11:02:21] <AdamPDotty> hmm no
[11:02:38] <mohsen_> It won't run?
[11:02:45] <AdamPDotty> in most cases it will run
[11:03:02] <AdamPDotty> but its hard to maintain
[11:03:20] <nxplus> mohsen_ : it's only by tradition you put scripts in the head
[11:03:31] <decx> nobody puts scripts in head anymore
[11:03:34] <AdamPDotty> best practice
[11:03:37] <decx> what is this 2001
[11:03:41] <nxplus> but not maybe today
[11:04:01] <decx> just before </body> is the appropriate place
[11:04:16] <decx> unless you have something like modernizr which doesnt care about body content anyway
[11:04:38] <mohsen_> It's a wordpress website, so if I wanna put it inside <head> I've to put it inside header.php file. So if my script is just related to a single page.
[11:05:07] <mohsen_> It will run in all pages.
[11:06:54] <decx> that's not how you do it in wordpress
[11:07:07] <decx> you register and enqueue styles and scripts in your functions file
[11:08:06] <mohsen_> Even javascript scripts?
[11:08:39] <decx> especially
[11:08:57] <decx> prevents your plugins from double loading stuff that you already registered in your theme
[11:10:21] <mohsen_> Should I echo the script in the functions file?
[11:10:44] <decx> https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_register_script/
[11:11:22] <mohsen_> Thanks
[11:19:58] <jerit> SledgeDJ you still there? Got your problem sorted out or what?
[11:56:01] <Akimb> Trying to make load more button and append some elements. The things is when I click the button it doesn't work(no get request is send). What could be the problem? http://pastebin.com/UhetbmgL
[11:57:02] <decx> .data-category isnt a valid property
[11:57:24] <decx> it's just .data - category
[12:01:34] <Akimb> The event handler doesn't react at all
[12:02:15] <Akimb>  contentButton.data-category I was trying to fetch data-category attribute, that was a bug, yes
[12:02:25] <Akimb> But that is not the root of the problem
[12:02:36] <decx> well that's probably when the function stops
[12:03:09] <Akimb> I put console.log with some at the top
[12:03:11] <Akimb> no response
[12:03:11] <Akimb> hmm
[12:03:40] <Akimb> with some text*
[12:05:01] <Akimb> works now. I was get the contentButton by getElementById and not jquery. Didn't know I can't use them interchangeably
[12:05:22] <taplar> you can, you just have to wrap the Element
[12:06:32] <Akimb> I see, anyway, thanks for the help
[12:21:12] <kulelu88> Hello all
[12:21:46] <kulelu88> how do I convert my function here: https://pastee.org/q732p . to render in jquery mobile like this: http://www.w3schools.com/jquerymobile/tryit.asp?filename=tryjqmob_lists_split
[12:22:27] <Akimb> What could be the problem ? when I use regular unicode letters, the response is good and no errors, but when I use something that utf8 supports, I get -> http://pastebin.com/5qxke4WJ
[12:36:00] <kulelu88> anybody?
[12:48:05] <taplar> Akimb: maybe the \ has to be escaped?  not sure
[12:57:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jhkbdub3/
[13:05:47] <_gm_> Hello all, I have a unique task where I need to modify content of a modal window, but the script must load before the content to be modified.
[13:06:25] <_gm_> I don't have access to the head nor can I include the script down near /body
[13:06:45] <_gm_> I also am not able to use async or defer
[13:06:56] <_gm_> can jQuery help me accomplish this?
[13:07:18] <taplar> you have control over the creation of the content in the modal?
[13:08:23] <_gm_> Not exactly - there is a simple HTML editor that allows the script tag.  The contents are boxed-in on the modal.
[13:08:53] <taplar> so... your script must come first, and you don't have control of what is generating the modal?
[13:09:18] <_gm_> That is correct.
[13:10:03] <_gm_> Using the Chrome console I can write a function that performs what I want since the modal is fully loaded at that time.
[13:10:06] <taplar> then short of some sort of polling to see when it's available to modify it, i'm not sure what you could do.  You could do possibly a MutationObserver, but they don't have widespread support yet
[13:10:39] <taplar> someone else may have a better idea
[13:10:51] <_gm_> I was researching an event listener
[13:11:04] <taplar> creation of dom elements doesn't fire events
[13:11:20] <taplar> which is a gap MutationObservers are trying to fill
[13:11:22] <_gm_> also, when the modal is drawn, the BODY class changes to include "modal-open"
[13:12:05] <_gm_> So I thought maybe I could use that to detect when it is drawn.
[13:12:17] <taplar> class changes also don't fire events, ;)
[13:12:23] <_gm_> darn
[13:13:36] <_gm_> The modal includes address info and a MapQuest map - who uses MapQuest?!  I want to nix the MapQuest map and create Google & Apple maps links using the address info. (no map display inline)
[13:16:23] <_gm_> jQuery, bootstrap-popover, easyXDM, tinyMCE are loaded
[13:18:01] <_gm_> oh and FullCalendar, a jQuery plugin
[13:18:08] <_gm_> which is what's powering the interface
[13:18:19] <kulelu88> how do I render content from an array into a split listview in jquery mobile?
[13:26:04] <nxplus> kulelu88: just loop the array with $.each and add all the <li>'s ?
[13:27:50] <kulelu88> nxplus: this is what I am currently doing: https://pastee.org/knddd
[13:29:01] <nxplus> and does it work?
[13:32:27] <kulelu88> nxplus: let me show you a screenshot of how it render
[13:32:29] <kulelu88> renders
[13:32:43] <nxplus> or if you have jsfiddle
[13:32:47] <nxplus> a
[13:33:16] <decx> probably need to listview('refresh')
[13:35:51] <kulelu88> nxplus: https://unsee.cc/detorisu/
[13:37:02] <kulelu88> if most of my dependencies are local, how/what is the quickest way to create a JS example? jsfiddle requires me to find online script versions
[13:37:15] <nxplus> hmm, try to set it up with jquery, something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gajotres/8uac7/ (overkill example)
[13:37:24] <nxplus> and like decx pointed out, use refresh at the end
[13:38:59] <nxplus> kulelu88 : best way is trying to create a simplified example with jsfiddle if you can
[13:39:13] <kulelu88> okay let me try doing that
[13:39:31] <nxplus> that just illustrates the issue
[13:43:14] <harroooonnharry> https://jsfiddle.net/gLf5zhk4/ why wont it run?
[13:43:44] <AwkwardCough> open your console
[13:45:35] <harroooonnharry> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[13:45:58] <AwkwardCough> so jQuery isn't included in that fiddle
[13:49:25] <kulelu88> do I need to specify dependencies in my html on jsfiddle?
[13:50:09] <arc_> jsfiddle has an interface for linking js libraries
[13:50:27] <arc_> the cog icon next to where it says javascript lets you select jquery for example
[13:50:36] <arc_> and then on the left it says external resources
[13:50:43] <arc_> and you can link whatever you want there
[13:50:51] <harroooonnharry> thanks i got it working.
[13:51:16] <decx> dont use jquery animation methods tho
[13:51:31] <harroooonnharry> what should i use decx?
[13:51:37] <decx> css
[13:51:37] <kulelu88> let me show you guys what i have. It doesn't render on jsfiddle sadly
[13:51:50] <kulelu88> https://jsfiddle.net/7x9x2cvd/
[13:52:14] <harroooonnharry> https://jsfiddle.net/gLf5zhk4/3/ is this the correct way to hover over the image?
[13:52:34] <nxplus> kulelu88 : you are missing the jquery reference
[13:53:21] <kulelu88> nxplus: where?
[13:53:30] <nxplus> sorry, my mistake, just notices the & not defined, maybe switch load order of jquery mobile and jquery
[13:53:47] <nxplus> $
[13:53:51] <nxplus> I meant
[13:55:01] <kulelu88> still not working nxplus :P
[13:55:32] <nxplus> do you still get the "(index):69 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined" in the console?
[13:55:38] <harroooonnharry> https://jsfiddle.net/gLf5zhk4/3/ why is it the animation does not run on the first hover if you hover over the second time it works?
[13:57:32] <kulelu88> I don't get any Uncaught ReferenceErrors
[14:03:31] <kulelu88> nxplus: how did that other jquery mobile example render, where mine wont?
[14:04:49] <nxplus> I'm unsure how they are rendered in jsfiddle, if the order is dependent of the order you add the references
[14:06:03] <kulelu88> but that is my code. I assume I need to make adjustments for the "load items" part to get it showing like your example
[14:08:38] <nxplus> kulelu88 : made a simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/8uac7/3357/
[14:08:44] <nxplus> can you use that?
[14:22:17] <decx> two things tho, don't append to the dom in a loop, don't needlessly call refresh every iteration
[14:24:33] <harroooonnharry> pastebin.com/UUf2GeAU is there a better way to animate or is this code correct?
[14:26:08] <nxplus> I stripped down the movie list example I pasted earlier and didn't analyze it enough, but that's true the refresh should probably be called after the loop
[14:55:02] <butor> Hi guys, I built a cool website with picture using bootstrap and col-md to display pictures of items. Now I m looking for a cool plugin that will allow the user to click on one of the picture to display the real picture in full size AND some kind of slider to display another pictures of the same item. Any advice ?
[15:11:20] <The_Photographer> Hi guys, Why when I click the buttom "Add Task" on first time, the windows is not showing? -->> https://tools.wmflabs.org/video2commons-test/
[15:12:19] <The_Photographer> data is already loaded
[15:14:01] <_TWG_> butor: Google
[15:15:14] <butor> <_TWG_> thanks bro
[15:18:22] <_TWG_> There are a bunch of plugins that do that so it's hard to recommend just a few.  Depends on what all you want them to do butor
[15:21:24] <AwkwardCough> The_Photographer: that link only has a link to wikimedia which goes to a login
[15:34:44] <nindustries> Hi guys, any idea why my form submit isn't hooked on my page? https://datapeak.hazcod.com/order/register    JS in question: http://pastie.org/pastes/10834651/text
[15:35:35] <AwkwardCough> so your not seeing the 'called' message?
[15:35:52] <nindustries> nope :/
[15:36:14] <AwkwardCough> console.log($('#formreg').length); as the first line of your jquery closure
[15:36:39] <nindustries> I found it AwkwardCough !
[15:36:44] <nindustries> regform instead of formreg :)

[16:24:50] <coraxx> Who knows how to work with jsTree ? :-)
[16:36:09] <nxplus> coraxx : what's the issue?
[16:37:01] <coraxx> nxplus: thx for responding :-) ... my issue is simple ... I want to use jsTree to display a 4-level tree structure ...and the data ..
[16:37:06] <nxplus> depending on how complex it is, I might be able to contribute
[16:38:05] <_TWG_> coraxx: I might be able to help as well.
[16:38:09] <coraxx> ...should be dynamic ... JSON AJAX  i.e. ... all examples online only shows 2-level trees :-(  ... how to do AJAX on 4-level trees ?
[16:38:25] <coraxx> _TWG_: thanx :-)
[16:39:23] <_TWG_> coraxx: Can you send a link to the example you are looking at?
[16:40:29] <coraxx> _TWG_:  the only example I'm working my code from is this --> https://www.jstree.com/docs/json/
[16:43:11] <coraxx> In the section "Using AJAX" they display 2 Root nodes ... and when you click one of the nodes the script loads the children ...however the node "One More" is loaded to early for my use ...only when clicking "Child 2"-node should it be loaded.
[16:43:19] <_TWG_> coraxx: if you look at line 19 you will see where you set the limit.  http://kopy.io/EC1Km
[16:44:22] <coraxx> _TWG_: ok ... good.
[16:44:53] <_TWG_> Let me know if that fixes it.
[16:45:18] <coraxx> _TWG_: And how to I make sure a child-subset is loaded only when clicked on AND with the correct url ?
[16:45:43] <_TWG_> Use kopy.io to send me what you have and I can look it over real quick.
[16:46:47] <coraxx> http://kopy.io/hH3AO
[16:49:06] <_TWG_> coraxx:  which line are you worried about?
[16:49:08] <nxplus> it seems weird if the lazy loading works that way on jstree, by default it should always load on clicking nodes
[16:50:11] <_TWG_> Yes
[16:50:25] <coraxx> _TWG_: lines 8-20
[16:50:55] <_TWG_> It should automatically do that.
[16:51:53] <coraxx> _TWG_: I've just inserted the "max_depth" paramter ...however right now the tree level is infinite :-)
[16:52:33] <_TWG_> That's odd because my example code came from https://www.jstree.com/demo/ and it was the first post.
[16:55:48] <coraxx> _TWG_: it seems the "statically" only put in 2 levels from root
[16:55:58] <coraxx> *they
[16:56:37] <_TWG_> yes it does
[16:57:29] <_TWG_> Be right back.  Have someone walking into my office.
[16:58:03] <coraxx> my problem is that I don't yet get the "grammar" of the jQuery and jsTree ... so I'm trying to deduct from examples and my experience with programming, how to write the code.
[16:58:18] <coraxx> _TWG_: ok :)
[17:23:36] <s34n> I have an element e for which $(e).on('drop', h) does not fire h
[17:23:59] <s34n> I do not stopPropagation on the event for any descendants of e
[17:27:24] <coraxx> http://kopy.io/fdk2A
[17:30:13] <coraxx> nxplus: check my above link ... there you will have my "real" question :-)
[17:33:28] <s34n> coraxx: https://github.com/vakata/jstree#populating-the-tree-using-ajax-and-lazy-loading-nodes
[17:35:15] <coraxx> s34n: thanx :D ...I will take a good look at that
[17:36:53] <nxplus> coraxx : build a static 4-level test structure and try it out on the example, and about lazyloading nodes, according to docs there is a boolean to control that
[17:38:41] <coraxx> nxplus: I tried building the static tree, but I couldn't ... I get the inifinity child-node problem.
[17:40:49] <nxplus> can you post the json?
[17:41:24] <WebDevB> Hey everyone... I'm working on someone else's code and I can't for the live of my figure out why they'd does this?
[17:41:38] <WebDevB> 	if ($('#box-discount button').length) { }
[17:42:15] <WebDevB> isn't this just going to check the length of the button?
[17:43:24] <nxplus> WebDevB :it's just checking for variable emptiness
[17:43:44] <WebDevB> mxplus? of a button?
[17:44:10] <coraxx> the sessions (root) http://kopy.io/xX2dD
[17:44:28] <nxplus> WebDevB :  i.e. if the selector gives any result
[17:45:15] <coraxx> the shoots (children) http://kopy.io/5vnkr
[17:46:22] <nxplus> coraxx : isn't that 1 level
[17:47:48] <nxplus> coraxx : according to jstree docs: "Any nested nodes are supplied in the same manner in the children property of their parent."
[17:48:21] <coraxx> nxplus: I'm actually reusing the children from level 1 ..in level 2 and so on.
[17:48:52] <coraxx> nxplus: meaning ?
[17:50:36] <nxplus> well, like in the example "using json" on https://www.jstree.com/docs/json/
[17:51:12] <nxplus> I was thinking you could build a simple complete test structure up to 4 levels, like that.. and try it out
[17:52:50] <coraxx> nxplus: I don't now the grammar ...my attempt to deduce it has failed ...using the examples from the pages you just sent wont help as none of them have more than 2 levels.
[17:55:00] <coraxx> *know
[17:55:40] <nxplus> going from your root example: just add another array of nodes like so http://kopy.io/BHVL8
[18:00:28] <coraxx> nxplus: just added your correction .. now the tree wont expand.
[18:01:47] <coraxx> nxplus: instead of looking at my failed code (and interpreation) .. why not look at what I seek to accomplish ...somebody have had to make an example of multilevel tree ...where the content is loaded dynamically ?
[18:02:53] <nxplus> hmm.. i just realized that it might be better to try and get the lazy loading working right away
[18:03:00] <nxplus> like http://jsfiddle.net/vakata/2kwkh2uL/5/
[18:03:12] <nxplus> from the tutorial s34n posted
[18:04:49] <coraxx> nxplus: interesting ...how did it get node 3 and 4 ?
[18:04:59] <nxplus> I am assuming you have the data somewhere accessible from an api
[18:06:03] <nxplus> coraxx : it is defined by the json, parent id etc.
[18:07:07] <coraxx> nxplus: yup ..but can you point to the actual data that says "Child node 3" ?
[18:10:03] <coraxx> nxplus: http://kopy.io/iHslK   <-- cant find the text or a reference to the text "Child node 3" in that.
[18:10:06] <nxplus> coraxx : it's in the http request, which node,  id=2, like http://www.jstree.com/fiddle?lazy&id=2
[18:10:31] <nxplus> you configure jstree to send the clicked node id with the ajax request
[18:11:27] <coraxx> nxplus: SEE THAT WAS THE MISSING KEY I WAS LOOKING FOR ... in non of the examples I've seen does it say that 'id' is POST'ed og GET'ed via HTTP !!!!
[18:14:58] <coraxx> nxplus: so the next question naturally becomes ... how you I send the "level" of the tree in the request.  as to elements/nodes can have the some ID, but be two different types.
[18:15:14] <coraxx> *to=two
[18:16:47] <nxplus> coraxx : yes, I think the documenation is a bit vague on jstree.com but it is mentioned under "Using AJAX"
[18:17:46] <nxplus> I think all nodes must be unique?
[18:17:51] <nxplus> ids
[18:18:27] <moonbeast> hi there, I have a login function that seems to be posting twice, is anyone able to see why https://jsfiddle.net/6hwcrmoz/
[18:18:42] <coraxx> nxplus: it is in the documentation ? ...can you tell where (what line) in the section "using AJAX" it says the id is passed via HTTP ?
[18:19:05] <coraxx> nxplus: damn ... then that would be a problem :-(
[18:19:19] <nxplus> "and a param will be passed indicating which node is being loaded"
[18:19:43] <nxplus> like I said it seems vaguely described
[18:20:55] <coraxx> nxplus: totally agree ... when you a writing in the context of javascript, then if nothing else is written its presumed that "passed" referers to variable given to javascript function ...NOT post'ed via HTTP.
[18:20:57] <nxplus> however, the tutorial seem to cover enough
[18:21:03] <coraxx> *youa = you are
[18:24:40] <Shai-Tan> I have $('#last_name, #first_name').blur( function(e){... How do I know which field the blur has occured on? this.something??
[18:24:43] <Shai-Tan> s/field/element
[18:24:43] <b-ot> Correction, <Shai-Tan> I have $('#last_name, #first_name').blur( function(e){... How do I know which element the blur has occured on? this.something??
[18:27:07] <moonbeast> ok ignore me if anyone was looking at my earlier post
[18:27:09] <nxplus> coraxx: I would read through that github tutorial to get a better understanding of jstree, you will probably also be dealing with events and more configuration later on..
[18:27:15] <coraxx> nxplus: THANK YOU so much for your time ... now I've have something to work on :-) ... hopefully I will get better at this GUI programming ...
[18:27:35] <coraxx> nxplus: I'm usually the backend programmer.
[18:27:37] <nxplus> yeah no problem, had very little to do this evening :)
[18:27:57] <coraxx> nxplus: yup sure will ...have already bookmarked and cloned the github page.
[18:28:21] <coraxx> nxplus: just curious ...where are you from in the world ?
[18:30:55] <Shai-Tan> I have $('#last_name, #first_name').blur( function(e){... How do I know which element the blur has occured on? this.something??
[18:55:05] <kodyk> hello
[18:58:57] <kodyk> Anyone here?
[19:21:39] <Sal> can someplease gimme a solution to stop touchmove on <body> ?
[19:22:38] <Sal> when i add a listener and preventDefault, every div stop scrolling, not only the body

[19:24:12] <Sal> anyone knows?
[19:41:16] <Shai-Tan> I get the name of an element with var fieldName = e.target.id; and thats fine, but how do I get the value of that element?
[19:41:44] <Shai-Tan> fieldValue = $(fieldName).val(); ???
[19:41:46] <Shai-Tan> or something
[19:50:06] <Sal> Shai-Tan, yep, use .val()
[19:50:43] <Shai-Tan> Sal, thanks
[19:51:28] <Sal> if its an input, or text() or html() if its a div, p or whatever
[19:52:47] <Shai-Tan> its an <input id="last_name" ... >
[19:53:16] <Shai-Tan> but it is coming back with undefined if I use var fieldName = e.target.id; var fieldValue = $(fieldName).val();
[19:54:17] <Shai-Tan> var fieldValue = $("#"+fieldName).val(); ??
[19:54:37] <Shai-Tan> yes,that did it
[19:54:48] <Shai-Tan> thats Sal, pointing my in the right direction
[19:55:11] <Shai-Tan> may your riches be filthy and your women filthier
[19:55:25] <Sal> hope that too

[23:06:39] <arc_> i'm trying to write a userscript for a site. i want to hide some text. unfortunately, the text is <p> <a>text i don't want to hide</a> <a>text i want to hide</a> other text i want to hide </p>
[23:06:57] <arc_> i'm not sure what the proper way of doing this is
[23:07:52] <arc_> idk why basically every site i ever want to make a userscript for has basic markup issues like this
[23:10:45] <D-rex> arc_:are you trying to hide on click?
[23:12:00] <arc_> nah just on load
[23:16:36] <arc_> lol. i'm just going to store the first anchor in a variable and delete the contents of the <p> and then reappend the contents of the var
[23:17:11] <D-rex> you could achive the hiding with css
[23:17:20] <arc_> how?
[23:19:47] <alex324> Hello , I would like to return an object inside a function like so: http://pastie.org/private/6ouzx86lidyff4m88ulalw (line 13) -- is it possible?
[23:21:50] <D-rex> arc_: http://pastebin.com/2T4En9aN
[23:22:56] <arc_> D-rex but the last text is not inside a span
[23:23:00] <arc_> that's the problem
[23:23:12] <arc_> i have no control over the html, that's why i'm writing a userscript
[23:40:30] <D-rex> arc_: try this for the css option http://pastebin.com/r6d9x1WA should work
[23:49:40] <bobdobbs> I'd like to attach a click event to an element which doesn't yet exist in the DOM. My understanding is that I should be able to do this with 'on().
[23:49:51] <bobdobbs> This is what I have: https://pastee.org/qa4yr
[23:50:19] <bobdobbs> That element doesnt exist when the page loads. It gets injected by a script.
[23:50:48] <bobdobbs> However, my script doesn't have my desired outcome: if I click on the link I don't get a message to the console
[23:52:43] <D-rex> try changing click to mousedown
[23:53:21] <D-rex> had a similar problem wne using mustache templates...thats what did it for me
[23:53:24] * bobdobbs googles mousedown
[23:53:44] <D-rex> change the word click to mousedown
[23:55:04] <bobdobbs> D-rex: ok, in my js file, I've made that alteration. But I still don't get the desired outcome. However...
[23:55:46] <bobdobbs> If I first assure that the element exists in the DOM, and then I paste the rewritten function into the console... then I get the outcome I want.
[23:56:06] <bobdobbs> I'll double check to make sure I'm writing to the correct file
[23:57:55] <bobdobbs> Yes. I'm definitely loading the correct file
[23:58:10] <bobdobbs> So... why would my script not be "working"?
[23:59:03] <D-rex> bobdobbs: see if his works http://pastebin.com/JHwAya29
