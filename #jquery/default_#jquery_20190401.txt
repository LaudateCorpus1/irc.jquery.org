[07:28:36] <IamTrying> var img = $('#' + beebox).find('div').eq(0); img.find('img').attr('src', 'images/green-icon.png');  How to tell img.find ( first image) and img.find( second image) ?
[07:30:12] <Cork> IamTrying: why are you splitting these up into separate finds?
[07:30:57] <Cork> $.map($('#' + beebox + ' img'), function(elm) { return elm.src; })
[07:31:06] <Cork> will give you the src of the different images
[07:31:23] <IamTrying> OK - thank you Cork
[07:31:48] <Cork> (especially as you call a div img...)
[10:23:32] <Nialcen> Hi everyone
[10:24:53] <Nialcen> Tryin' to use croppie, very simply for now, but at very start of my test, it throws an error at me that I can't handle to solve, as everything I checked seems to be right. Someone got few minutes to take a look ?
[10:25:24] <Cork> make a jsfiddle with a demo of the problem
[10:36:27] <denisbr> Hi! I´m using an ajax requisition and using the return from requisition into a iframe. ONLY in the chrome browser, I get a canceled status (in the developer tools) and after I get a 200 status (ok), in the same requistion. Anybody have any suggestion?
[10:43:06] <Cork> denisbr: you have to show the code
[10:43:51] <denisbr> Cork, moment
[10:56:37] <denisbr> Cork, https://pastebin.com/0NFWpj3r
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> denisbr what does the first request fail with?
[11:19:09] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, sorry?
[11:19:36] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused by your problem statement
[11:19:47] <robertmaxrees> mind tring to rephrase it? :)
[11:23:00] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, Well, when I do the ajax requisition and open the frame, the chrome return a canceled status and after return me the iframe content
[11:23:16] <taplar> r/requisition/request
[11:23:20] <robertmaxrees> "ajax requisition"??
[11:23:20] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[11:23:33] <Ziberius> requisition = request?
[11:23:37] <taplar> yeah
[11:23:42] <taplar> they're doing an ajax request
[11:24:04] <robertmaxrees> denisbr also: what does the ajax call have to do with a "frame"?
[11:24:06] <taplar> you're not filling out a form to try to get something.  you're making a web request, :)
[11:25:12] <Ziberius> He's creating an iframe with the result of the request
[11:25:21] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[11:25:47] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, the ajax create a pdf file and then I open the pdf content into iframe
[11:25:47] <taplar> https://pastebin.com/0NFWpj3r  he's grabbing parts of the response to make the url
[11:26:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what fails?  we can't see your dev tools or anything.
[11:31:41] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, see https://ibb.co/T00Z4MF
[11:32:37] <denisbr> In the blue border I´m displaying the requests
[11:34:04] <robertmaxrees> click on the one that fails and look at the "headers" tab
[11:40:55] <denisbr> https://pastebin.com/1HsaBhDx
[11:44:45] <robertmaxrees> there should be a lot more info there
[11:50:24] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, Only this information
[11:50:49] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[11:51:10] <denisbr> https://ibb.co/b2vqvcn
[11:51:11] <robertmaxrees> have you tried looking at the server side of things and see if there's more info there?
[11:51:28] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, is a localhost server
[11:51:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:51:46] <robertmaxrees> cool?
[11:51:50] <robertmaxrees> so... have you tried looking at the server side of things and see if there's more info there?
[11:52:56] <Ziberius> if it's localhost it should be ease :-D
[11:53:21] <robertmaxrees> wait a sec...
[11:53:44] <robertmaxrees> is the page you're on the same port, protocol, and domain and the ones with the iframe?
[11:54:25] <robertmaxrees> also, check what your server is doing with the X-Frame-Options header
[11:56:05] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, yes ... The same port, protocol and domain... Before return the pdf content into frame, return this canceled status
[11:56:10] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[11:56:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it in action.  sorry :)
[11:57:07] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, I understand, but, I can´t publish it into public server now :-)
[11:57:20] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[11:57:46] <taplar> one thing I might try, to rule out jQuery, cause this really shouldn't be a jQuery thing
[11:57:54] <robertmaxrees> ^ great point
[11:58:00] <taplar> the part where you are appending the iframe
[11:58:05] <taplar> you're appending it to the body?
[11:58:26] <denisbr> I will test
[11:58:47] <taplar> you're appending it to the body?
[11:58:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:59:31] <denisbr> taplar, I, I´m appeding to the body
[11:59:47] <taplar> so try changing it to: document.body.innerHTML += 'your html here'
[12:00:05] <taplar> rather than creating the iframe in $()
[12:00:06] <denisbr> ok
[12:06:38] <denisbr> taplar, I replaced by your suggestion and works... But I don´t understand difference between "document.body.innerHtml" and "appendTo(document.body)"
[12:07:13] <taplar> appendTo is jQuery.  innerHTML is straight javascript
[12:07:30] <taplar> so there's possibly something with jQuery trying to turn your html into DOM nodes that is conflicting some how
[12:07:47] * taplar runs to get lunch
[12:10:22] <denisbr> taplar, ok... Thanks for help me
[12:10:30] <denisbr> robertmaxrees, thanks for you too :-)
[16:04:13] <iwuey> trying to set expires= into my cookie but now i cant get the Expire time + 30 in the cookie https://jsfiddle.net/a1cgh8np/
[17:24:08] <makr8100> I'm trying to connect jquery ajax to an api that has documentation for curl.  It specifies -u which means I need to provide an argument username:password - any clue how I could do this in jquery?
[17:25:14] <makr8100> eh, nevermind...  I just realized I'll then be putting a username and password client-side...  I'll do php and mask it
[17:25:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:25:43] <makr8100> I should think about my stupidity before I post P:
