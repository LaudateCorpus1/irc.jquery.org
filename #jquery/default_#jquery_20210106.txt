[06:30:55] <IHasFingers> hi guys, i need some help please. I am creating a pop up form, the buttom pop up when you click on a button with id c-btn. When you click on this, it should make an ajax request to get the data needed for the form and if successful show the form. I tried https://kopy.io/Xa3e3#line-11 but got nothing, the console log does shows and as well as console.log(result); however the form does not pop up

[11:38:40] <IHasFingers> Cork, hi
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> IHasFingers make a jsfiddle instead.
[12:34:33] <robertmaxrees> IHasFingers also, that click handler doersn't make ansy sense.
[12:34:38] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't
[12:34:57] <IHasFingers> Hi robertmaxrees am doing it now
[12:35:03] <IHasFingers> give me about 5 mins please
[12:44:56] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/IHasFinger/1kcv387h/5/ Basially Have a few question as I am looking for some suggestions please. What I am doing is a claims form when an admin is processing a claim, they need to ask/answer some questions, based on the answer it will make a call to the backend, save the answer and then get the next question(if any). The structure of the question json return by request.php looks like
[12:44:56] <IHasFingers> https://kopy.io/YaVoz
[12:45:48] <IHasFingers> my questions are: (1) should I valid backend or front, if yes how? (2)How can i best handle the next, previous buttons in jquery
[12:45:59] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[12:46:02] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time.
[12:46:12] <robertmaxrees> so for starters, you just want to know how to handle validation?
[12:46:42] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, yes as am rubbish with frontend I was just going to do it backend
[12:46:57] <robertmaxrees> you should ALWAYS validate backend, regardless.
[12:47:09] <IHasFingers> and forget the frontend, i know you ideally do it in backend
[12:47:10] <robertmaxrees> for things like security issues and the like.
[12:47:18] <robertmaxrees> you should ALSO do it frontend.
[12:47:42] <robertmaxrees> you could return errors with validation issues from the backend on submit and then display those on the frontend.
[12:47:42] <IHasFingers> am not doing it front end
[12:48:03] <IHasFingers> will just saw message if it failed, etc
[12:48:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> can you re-phrase your question, then?
[12:49:01] <robertmaxrees> really confused by your responses.
[12:50:13] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, which one?
[12:50:50] <robertmaxrees> "should I valid backend or front, if yes how?"
[12:51:03] <robertmaxrees> you should always validate backend.
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> that's always priority #1 - frontend validation can be easily bypassed.
[12:51:43] <IHasFingers> yes I know that. I wanted to do both front and back
[12:51:55] <IHasFingers> but will do back only
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> once backend is implemented, you should add frontend validation for user convenience.  you could have your backend return validation issues and simply display that information to the user.
[12:54:14] <IHasFingers> what about question 2 please
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> you bind event listeners for them.
[12:54:41] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not really sure what you're asking with that one)
[12:55:31] <IHasFingers> https://jsfiddle.net/IHasFinger/1kcv387h/7/
[12:56:11] <IHasFingers> basically the question is shown 1 by 1, for example https://kopy.io/YaVoz this is question 2.
[12:56:23] <IHasFingers> if you answer Yes the next question is question 3
[12:56:34] <IHasFingers> if you answer no the next question is question 4
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> right.  so where's the confusion?
[12:56:44] <IHasFingers> if you answer not sure the next question is question 7
[12:57:35] <robertmaxrees> on click, check what question you're on and request one higher from the server.
[12:57:38] <robertmaxrees> boom, done.
[12:58:42] <IHasFingers> when the question is displays, the next button should only show up when you pick the required amount of answers( min/max in the link)
[12:59:21] <IHasFingers> the question form input html is built in jquery and append to the id
[12:59:30] <IHasFingers> how can I check this?
[12:59:35] <robertmaxrees> what are you checking?
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> "the question form input html is built in jquery and append to the id" "how can I check this?"
[13:00:21] <IHasFingers> lets say the question was a checkbox and you need to tick 3 options, if you tick less than 3 the next button should not show
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> validate the form - when it meets certain criteria, show the button.
[13:01:08] <IHasFingers> still need to do front end validation then
[13:01:12] <robertmaxrees> in that case, it could be as simple as an .on('input', '.question-option', function() {
[13:01:17] <robertmaxrees> or w/e class you'd give 'em.
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> bind to the modal's root element and call it a day.
[13:03:21] <IHasFingers> zero idea what you are talking about :)
[13:03:37] <robertmaxrees> where did i lose you?
[13:11:39] <robertmaxrees> IHasFingers ?
[13:12:26] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, sorry am here
[13:12:48] <IHasFingers> got lost at on('input', '.question-option', function() {
[13:12:56] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> just a delegated handler.
[13:13:35] <IHasFingers> as i was thinking if its possible to create a function which takes in the name field and the min/max values and then does some check to see ifits valid or not
[13:13:49] <IHasFingers> might have to show it regardless and then do it backend
[13:13:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean...
[13:13:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7dL1zow4/
[13:14:04] <robertmaxrees> something like this is pretty trivial.
[13:17:20] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, thats great, please what will this work if you were to pass it a min of 2 and max of 3 for example? https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7dL1zow4/
[13:17:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:17:42] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to be able to set a range?
[13:18:12] <robertmaxrees> if (numberOfChecks >= 3) { just update this.
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[13:26:25] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, thank you. last question as am  building my input like this. https://kopy.io/bvsi7#line-11
[13:26:47] <IHasFingers> something it could be a select option, or another html input type
[13:27:00] <IHasFingers> does $theModal.on('input' cover all of those
[13:27:19] <IHasFingers> or i have to make one for select and the others
[13:27:26] <robertmaxrees> huh
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:27:35] <robertmaxrees> asking two different questions here.
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> 1. not sure if selects emit the "input" event.  2. go back and look at the entire line of code.
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> it's $theModal.on('input', '.some-descriptive-classname', function() {
[13:28:49] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, yea I know was removing the others bas its the class name and function :)
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:30:41] <robertmaxrees> your question and your last statement don't make any sense.
[13:31:15] <IHasFingers> robertmaxrees, sorry just tried not slept much seen the baby came
[13:31:50] <robertmaxrees> all good.  just not clear about what you're asking.
[13:31:54] <IHasFingers> think will call it a day now. Thanks for your help. Really appreciate it
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> sure.  what we're here for.
