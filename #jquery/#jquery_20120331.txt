[00:00:53] <smares> hey guys, I have a div with ID Blah and it contains a lot of checkboxes
[00:01:16] <smares> I want to select all checkboxes whose value contains an arbitrary string
[00:01:39] <smares> $('#Blah input[type="checkbox"]') returns all of them
[00:01:58] <Cronoh> loop through the children check their properties
[00:02:01] <smares> $('#Blah input[type="checkbox"][value~="meh"]') returns nothing
[00:02:11] <smares> although I have checkboxes with "meh" as value
[00:02:41] <smares> I also tried leaving out the type selector doing only input[value...]
[00:03:53] <smares> just noticing in the docu...
[00:04:01] <smares> does ~= scan whole words only?
[00:04:05] <Cronoh> i think you will need to loop.
[00:04:13] <Cronoh> i dont think you can use selectors like that
[00:04:21] <Cronoh> but i havent used jquery in like a year lol srs
[00:04:25] <smares> apparently it matches "man" in "milk man" but not in "man-news"
[00:06:29] <smares> have to use *= and not ~=
[00:19:11] <Defusal> hi everyone
[00:19:30] <Defusal> does anyone know why enableSelection() does not always work?
[00:19:52] <Defusal> if you use $('body').disableSelection()
[00:20:25] <Defusal> i want to dialog selection for the whole page except certain elements that are later created
[00:44:35] <Defusal> i would like to restrict text selection to only inside certain elements
[00:44:57] <Defusal> so that you can't drag inside a dialog window and select other parts of the page too
[00:45:04] <Defusal> does anyone know how i can do this?
[00:46:51] <intellilogic> Using firefox and firebug, examining someone else's page trying to understand the javascript, any tips on see what JS caused an action?  I don't want to search through all the files or go through a million break points.  Any suggestions / ideas?
[00:46:57] <intellilogic> Using firefox and firebug, examining someone else's page trying to understand the javascript, any tips on see what JS caused an action?  I don't want to search through all the files or go through a million break points.  Any suggestions / ideas?
[00:47:19] <intellilogic> Whoops, twice - fail
[00:47:20] <intellilogic> sorry
[00:58:55] <Defusal> sigh
[00:59:41] <beancurd> :(
[00:59:43] <Defusal> even when i manage to disableSelection() on all the right elements and enableSelection() on the dialog box, it still allows me to drag from the dialog box outside and selects text that is otherwise unselectable
[00:59:56] <Defusal> if anyone has any idea how to solve this, i'd really appreciate it :(
[01:06:12] <sjeijk> hi all can anyone help me a little bit, I have fancy box implemented on a site and I want some nice captions when I hover on the images, so I combined it with another script that puts a div on the images and on hover it displays. Only problem now is, that if I click the image/caption fancy box won't work anymore. Any help appreciated.
[01:06:29] <sjeijk> in progress here http://dev.advieszaken.nl/index.php?id=22
[01:09:46] <sjeijk> nvm got it to work :s  sometimes it just helps if you ask it in IRC
[01:09:46] <mikekelly> Hi all :)

[01:10:35] <mikekelly> I can't seem to get the :input selector to work in zepto, does that sound normal?
[01:17:07] <_zoggy_> jquery 1.7.2 is out. plz update topic
[01:18:00] <_zoggy_> jqueryui.com says 1.7.3 is latest. goof?
[01:23:57] <jita> How could i read the user property of this variable [<img user="ubuntu" src="/media/images/americano_1.jpg.400x300_q85_crop.jpg" alt style="display: none; ">] ?
[01:23:58] <jita> i tried
[01:24:10] <jita> foo[0].user
[01:24:13] <jita> it says undefined
[01:24:28] <jita> yet foo[0].src works fine
[01:25:05] <_zoggy_> $(#foo).attr('user')
[01:37:06] <jita> _zoggy_, thanks
[01:38:03] <jita> _zoggy_, is there a way to create or alter value of a span? Like i want to insertAfter a span only if it does not exist in the first place, if it exist it should replace that with the older one thus not creating another new span element
[01:43:18] <_zoggy_> sure, just set it. look up attr on jquery site
[01:43:25] <_zoggy_> ? attr
[01:43:26] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/

[02:28:54] <minna> Hello, i'm getting conflicting answers about mobile cache? Is it true that only 25kb of JS is cached?
[02:31:04] <arek_deepinit> minna: what that question means?
[02:31:32] <pilch> I have an ecommerce product page and it it has two versions.  One which shows a single item and another version which shows mutltiple variations of the product. Both pages have different code for the online price.  [10:23:30 | Edited 10:23:47] Richard Hellier: $("#ctl00_cph1_prodCollection_ctrl0_lblCollOnlinePrice div").text(); will show me the first items price for the mutilple pages and $("span#ctl00_cph1_pD_ctrl0_lblOnlinePrice").t
[02:32:06] <minna> arek_deepinit: Hm?
[02:32:54] <pilch> .. on the single item page.  What I want to be able to do is to introduce some IF logic and say if $("#ctl00_cph1_prodCollection_ctrl0_lblCollOnlinePrice div").text(); isn't present on page display $("span#ctl00_cph1_pD_ctrl0_lblOnlinePrice").text();
[02:32:56] <arek_deepinit> minna: extend your question
[02:33:31] <pilch> I have ventured into the world of IF's just yet with my JQuery and I have looked within jquery.com and several ovther places and i still can't grasp the solution
[02:35:05] <minna> arek_deepinit: On some sites i read that iOS only caches 25kb of JS, if it is larges it does not cache, on other sites i read that JS and CSS that are 1-4MB are cached but that html that are larger than 25kb is not cached.
[02:35:22] <minna> arek_deepinit: I was wondering if anyone here have experience with this first hand.
[02:35:39] <pilch> does anyone understand what I'm trying to accomplish?
[02:36:29] <arek_deepinit> minna: i think its up to browser settings
[02:36:34] <arek_deepinit> its for sure not hard coded
[02:51:05] <KnowWhat> hi there
[02:51:12] <KnowWhat> i wanna get whole querystring in jquery
[03:05:26] <KnowWhat> can i get whole query string in jquery?
[03:06:07] <g0th> moin
[03:06:27] <KnowWhat> moin?
[03:06:31] <g0th> morning
[03:06:44] <mnemoc> it actually means "good" :)
[03:06:48] <KnowWhat> evening here though
[03:07:11] <mnemoc> KnowWhat: welcome to IRC, where everyone has his own timezone
[03:08:28] <g0th> I want to use jquery's draggable plugin and all other jquery stuff, I clicked on download, selected all, unzipped. to use all can I just use "development-bundle/ui/jquery-ui-1.8.18.custom.js" ?
[03:08:50] <g0th> or do I need any other files from the zip file?
[03:09:46] <g0th> resp. js/jquery-ui-1.8.18.custom.min.js if I am done developing
[03:12:01] <g0th> hmm, seems not
[03:12:05] <g0th> it is not working :(
[03:14:09] <g0th> ok, I simply kept the old jquery stuff and now it works, so that answers my question I guess
[03:19:25] <KnowWhat> mnemoc, thanks, but i wanna get the whole query string in jquery .ajax function, how can i do that
[03:22:07] <g0th> Ã¿hmm, I have a question about draggable
[03:24:14] <g0th> I have a big container and a small container (inside the big one) and within that small container something (lets call it A) of width/height that should be draggable. But if I click on A to "drag" it I want it to drag the whole small container. How to do that?
[03:24:55] <g0th> i.e. the small container is the thing I want to drag, but I would prefer to specify width/height/etc from another element
[03:25:00] <g0th> to trigger the dragging
[03:26:20] <g0th> the small container encodes all positioning information within the big container (basically we just care about it's left property), whereis A encodes how the individual objects look like (in particular width/height/etc)
[03:27:31] <g0th> anyone?
[03:35:17] <g0th> handle!
[03:58:39] <arphen> hi
[03:58:55] <arphen> will functions bound with .toClick carried out before or after default behaviour?
[03:59:16] <arphen> can i bind some action not o perform until default behaviour has happened
[04:21:02] <ura> hi
[04:21:16] <ura> Is it possible to append an array of DOM elements?
[04:21:35] <ura> $(document.body).append([$('<hr>'), $('<hr>')])
[04:22:38] <ura> When I'm passing an array of DOM elements I'm getting an error (inside internals of jquery). But it's said in jQuery API that content could be an array of DOM elements.
[04:24:15] <Haprog> ura: jQuery object !== DOM element
[04:24:37] <ura> ah, thanks :)
[04:24:38] <Haprog> you can get the dom element of a jQuery object with [0]
[04:24:49] <Haprog> $('<hr>')[0] for example
[04:25:13] <Haprog> I'm not 100% sure that would work when creating a new element though.
[04:25:56] <ura> I added .get(0) and everything works like a charm :) Thanks!
[04:26:00] <Haprog> np :)
[04:34:10] <g0th> hmm
[04:34:28] <g0th> when I drag an object, during the dragging procedure the overall container changes its left position
[04:35:00] <g0th> this somehow leads to the strange behaviour that now the mouse cursor is no longer over the center of the dragged object
[04:35:10] <g0th> instead it is "shifted" by this "left position" change
[04:35:28] <g0th> how to correct this behaviour to something that makes more sense?
[04:36:49] <g0th> the draggable thing has absolute positioning wrt the container
[04:36:57] <g0th> so it "should" not matter that I move the container
[04:37:04] <g0th> but apparently it does matter
[05:06:31] <g0th> anyone?
[05:10:07] <g0th> another thing: I have several jquery objects that I access through a "reference" array (basically using the index of the array), but now I use jquery's draggable ui and I drag those objects around, at the end I would like to modify "stuff" based on the index of the object that I move around. Is the only option i have to store the index temporarly as e.g. an id of the object, then query the id at the end (when we finnished dropping) and then 
[05:10:44] <g0th> hmm, where would I store this id?
[05:11:09] <g0th> can I use the ui object from the event for this somehow?
[05:11:52] <g0th> like ui.helper.id?
[05:12:07] <g0th> or ui.helper.className?
[05:12:41] <g0th> I kind of feel like this is ugly, to use html content to store javascript parameters that have nothing to do with the html content
[05:12:57] <g0th> silence ...
[05:13:53] <g0th> oh, or I could use a global js variable to store the index in when I start dragging and then access it again from there
[05:16:06] <g0th> arg, no the second method doesn't work
[05:16:15] <g0th> because when I call start I again won't know the index :(
[05:16:24] <g0th> this is really annoying
[05:18:18] <g0th> I have very clear reasons not to store the index in the id of the elements
[05:18:22] <g0th> performance reasons mostly
[05:19:51] <asher^> anyone know an extension like jcrop that allows multiple selection areas?
[05:29:12] <g0th> ok I solved my issue: I can do ar.indexOf(jqueryObject)
[05:30:11] <g0th> now, with jquery's draggable plugin: is there a way to get access to the initial jquery object (not the clone) for events?
[05:31:03] <g0th> oh, is it just "this"?
[05:33:56] <arphen> how can i write this more concisely :                               $("<div>").addClass("footertest").attr("data-role","footer").attr("id",pg.attr("data-url")+"footer").attr('data-position','fixed').html('test').appendTo($.mobile.activePage).trigger("create");
[05:34:55] <arphen> because im gonna have to add a few more containers
[05:37:24] <gaius65> How can I add a element as first element inside of an $('div#xy') ?
[05:38:09] <Zeph88> gaius65: http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[05:40:31] <gaius65> Zeph88: Sry, insert!
[05:44:33] <g0th> hmm, when I do something like this:  var A=$(htmlElement); jArray=[A]; var self=this; A.draggable({ stop: function(e,ui) {var index=self.jArray.indexOf(this); console.log(index); } });
[05:44:38] <g0th> then I always get -1 for the index
[05:44:41] <g0th> why?
[05:45:20] <g0th> hmm resp. how do I access A from the stop function?
[05:45:39] <g0th> or even better how to get the jArray index from the stop function?
[05:48:34] <g0th> $(this).data('draggable') ?
[05:49:28] <g0th> this is also not working :(
[05:55:48] <g0th> anyone?
[06:00:56] <g0th> hi
[06:01:39] <g0th> if I drag a jquery object, how do I access this initial jquery object during the "stop" event?
[06:01:56] <g0th> $(this).data('draggable') doesn't seem to work :(
[06:02:04] <g0th> I basically have this:
[06:03:07] <Articate> So, my current jquery script works in firefox, but not in IE
[06:03:23] <Articate> and older version works in both, so I'm guessing it's something in the code
[06:03:29] <Articate> are there any usual culprits?
[06:03:52] <Articate> (that is, my own script - not jquery itself)
[06:04:34] <g0th> var A=$(el); this.jArray=[]; this.jArray[0]=A; var self=this; A.draggable({ stop: function(e,ui) { var inst=$(this).data('draggable'); var index=self.jArray.indexOf(inst); console.log(index); } });
[06:04:40] <g0th> but I always get -1 for the index???
[06:04:54] <beancurd> Articate: bring up IE devtools and see if any errors come up.
[06:05:30] <Innocentus> What should be preferred? A plugin which fires an event or calls a callback function?
[06:06:08] <g0th> do you receive any "answers" from the callback function?
[06:06:57] <Articate> yeah, found an error. Thanks for the tip, beancurd :)
[06:07:14] <Articate> is there a similar tool for firefox, btw?
[06:07:29] <Articate> firebug can't catch such errors, can it?
[06:07:59] <Articate> (oh wait, maybe it can)
[06:09:04] <PavelloZ> have you tried firebug? :)
[06:09:19] <beancurd> np, yeah firebug will catch it, also chrome dev tools.
[06:09:41] <g0th> var A=$(el); this.jArray=[]; this.jArray[0]=A; var self=this; A.draggable({ stop: function(e,ui) { var inst=$(this).data('draggable'); var index=self.jArray.indexOf(inst); console.log(index); } });
[06:09:42] <PavelloZ> opera's dragonfly too
[06:09:49] <g0th> why do I always get -1?
[06:10:09] <Innocentus> g0th: I want to add this to a custom plugin. Now I would like to notify somehow, that download is completed.
[06:10:22] <Innocentus> g0th: I can do this by calling a given callback function - or by firing an event
[06:10:44] <Innocentus> g0th: the question is if an event in jquery is rather meant for DOM only - and not for api / plugins
[06:10:45] <g0th> hmm, better ask other guys in here since this is jquery plugin specific
[06:10:54] <Innocentus> g0th: it is implementation specific
[06:11:43] <g0th> I asked myself similar questions for my project
[06:12:13] <g0th> in one case the function was returning something in which case events seem to be the wrong choice but I guess it is still possible
[06:12:30] <g0th> generally events are prefered I think, but better also ask someone else
[06:12:48] <g0th> var A=$(el); this.jArray=[]; this.jArray[0]=A; var self=this; A.draggable({ stop: function(e,ui) { var inst=$(this).data('draggable'); var index=self.jArray.indexOf(inst); console.log(index); } });
[06:15:05] <g0th> how do I get the draggable object??
[06:21:03] <xec> Innocentus: you can, like jQuery UI usually does, do both a callback and a custom event
[06:23:42] <xec> g0th: i'm not 100% on this, but you seem to be adding a jquery collection to an array, and then trying to find it by passing the result of a .data() call to indexOf(), which doesn't make too much sense to me
[06:25:04] <g0th> xec: what should I do instead?
[06:25:45] <g0th> how do I get the draggable jquery object?
[06:26:33] <g0th> one idea might be to make the overall container "droppable" and use ui.draggable there
[06:26:36] <xec> g0th: inside the stop callback?
[06:26:41] <g0th> yes
[06:27:24] <xec> I don't see one in the docs?  http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[06:27:36] <g0th> what do you mean?
[06:27:45] <g0th> it is not possible to get the jquery draggable object?
[06:27:53] <xec> nevermind i was looking at the options not events
[06:28:45] <xec> well, what is $(this) ? is'nt that sufficient? or maybe console.log() the ui parameter
[06:30:13] <g0th> $(this) didn't work
[06:31:30] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/ugTPn/
[06:32:29] <xec> g0th: "this" is the dragged element
[06:33:00] <g0th> that also didn't work
[06:33:42] <xec> g0th: in what sense, you dont get the jsfiddle i pasted to log the element?
[06:33:45] <g0th> it looks correct
[06:34:01] <suark> Hi all.... how do I test if an element exists in the DOM structure already? (from what I can tell if I call $('#id') it will create it if it doesn't exist already)
[06:34:03] <g0th> but if I do:             var index=self.status.actionList.indexOf(inst);
[06:34:08] <g0th> then index==-1 all the time
[06:34:20] <xec> what is inst?
[06:34:25] <xec> could you make a demo?
[06:36:03] <xec> i gotta go in a couple min, but you're more likely to get help if you manage to make a decent demonstration of the problem.
[06:36:06] <g0th> http://pastebin.com/8XLsfRnS
[06:36:24] <g0th> line 239+
[06:36:32] <xec> suark: you can check the length property. also, $("#id") will NOT create anythin
[06:36:33] <xec> g
[06:37:11] <xec> g0th: what is in actionList?
[06:37:33] <xec> DOM elements?
[06:37:58] <suark> xec: Thanks heaps! :) I'm still learning, and that hint helps a lot. :)
[06:38:08] <g0th> no jquery objects
[06:38:35] <g0th> line 221
[06:38:46] <xec> g0th: what if you put DOM elements in there instead?
[06:39:39] <g0th> you people suggested to me to use jquery in the first place
[06:39:54] <g0th> I spent like 8 hours on transitioning from html element to jquery elements
[06:40:54] <Innocentus> hi
[06:42:04] <xec> g0th: i don't know who "you people" are, or the backstory, i'm just asking to see if you realize the point i'm making. i'm also not going to stare at 250 lines of static code trying to figure out what it does. see ?demo
[06:42:05] <bot-t> g0th, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:42:07] <Innocentus> I made a plugin as recommended in http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods
[06:42:19] <Innocentus> But now I don't know how a function can call another one?
[06:42:25] <Innocentus> this.function() doesn't work
[06:42:36] <Innocentus> who can a plugin method call another plugin method?
[06:42:49] <Innocentus> or should I store internally used plugin methods somewhere else in plugin?
[06:42:54] <Innocentus> Please clarify
[06:42:59] <pifantastic> ?p @ Innocentus
[06:43:00] <bot-t> Innocentus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:43:43] <Hornet> "Just dont use any of that gay queerie stuff to make the website, were a family business."
[06:44:03] <g0th> xec: ok, sorry
[06:44:05] <xec> lol Hornet
[06:44:15] <suark> Innocentus function a(arg) { b(arg); }
[06:44:24] <g0th> xec: lets just say there are reasons for using jquery elements
[06:44:52] <g0th> I think I will try the droppable approach instea
[06:45:17] <g0th> i.e. I will make all those decision on the big container, there I can use ui.draggable
[06:45:37] <g0th> it seems that it is not possible to get the jquery element corresponding to my array
[06:45:39] <xec> g0th: so what you're doing at the moment is trying to find a jquery collection in an array by searching for a DOM element
[06:46:09] <g0th> by searching for a jquery element
[06:46:20] <g0th> I am trying to get the jquery element from within the stop function
[06:46:30] <g0th> resp. a collection
[06:47:09] <xec> g0th: what is inst? it's not a jquery collection
[06:47:19] <xec> g0th: of course you won't find any because there are no DOM elements in the array. that said, i'm not sure you can achieve this, i believe you would get a new collection by calling $(this)
[06:47:28] <g0th> I want inst to be the jquery element corresponding to the draggable
[06:47:40] <g0th> ok
[06:47:47] <g0th> so I cannot get the "original" collection?
[06:48:01] <xec> not unless you cache it somehow
[06:48:08] <g0th> how?
[06:48:16] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: here an example: http://jsfiddle.net/h3Fce/1/
[06:48:28] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: I try to call another plugin function
[06:48:35] <g0th> I could disable the clone handler
[06:48:44] <g0th> then ui.handler would be my draggable jquery object, no?
[06:48:58] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: oops - corrected version here: http://jsfiddle.net/h3Fce/2/   !!!
[06:49:27] <xec> if all you want is an index, maybe store it on the element's .data() ?
[06:49:38] <g0th> again, how?
[06:49:48] <xec> how to use .data()?
[06:49:50] <g0th> when I start dragging I have the same problem
[06:49:54] <g0th> I don't know the index
[06:50:00] <pifantastic> Innocentus: http://jsfiddle.net/Qjy5y/1/
[06:50:10] <pifantastic> Innocentus: a few problems
[06:50:12] <xec> g0th: is this a sortable?
[06:50:16] <g0th> no
[06:50:28] <pifantastic> Innocentus: First, you have to use () to execute a function, so `this.next` won't execute, you need `this.next()`
[06:50:49] <xec> i'm sorry i gotta go. but if you can make a demo, someone will probably be able to help
[06:51:02] <g0th> hmm, I could submit non-working code to github
[06:51:09] <g0th> and give the github link
[06:51:10] <pifantastic> Innocentus: Second, in this example, you are setting the scope of your methods to be the Dom Element. That means inside your method functions, `this` refers to an Element, not the `methods` object.
[06:51:14] <g0th> but I think it is simply not possible
[06:51:18] <g0th> and I need to use droppable
[06:51:40] <g0th> can I make something droppable before I add it to the dom?
[06:51:56] <xec> i think you can
[06:52:06] <g0th> ok, one last question
[06:52:14] <xec> not 100% sure on that though
[06:52:15] <g0th> if I move the big (droppable) container
[06:52:30] <g0th> then suddenly my mouse is no longer over the draggable object
[06:52:32] <g0th> but "shifted"
[06:53:07] <g0th> how can I make sure that the mouse pointer is always over the object, if necessray let it jump
[06:53:31] <xec> don't move the droppable?
[06:53:32] <xec> :D
[06:53:51] <xec> until after you've dropped
[06:53:53] <g0th> when I move the droppable it looks very strange that the mouse is suddenly at a completely different place than the thing I move
[06:54:08] <g0th> well I want to move it
[06:54:30] <g0th> the draggable has an absolute position towards it
[06:54:52] <g0th> so its position wrt the window should be adjusted accordingly
[06:54:57] <xec> you lost me, or are you confusing draggable with droppable
[06:55:07] <g0th> forget about droppable
[06:55:12] <suark> Innocentus: http://jsfiddle.net/h3Fce/4/
[06:55:13] <g0th> I move a draggable around
[06:55:22] <g0th> then the mouse is always exactly in the middle of it
[06:55:31] <g0th> but if I move the underlying parent container it is not true anymore
[06:55:45] <g0th> how can I make it true again ^^
[06:55:47] <Innocentus> hi again
[06:56:14] <g0th> resp. I don't understand what the mouse position reflects
[06:56:25] <xec> g0th: why are you moving the parent?
[06:56:32] <Innocentus> hi again
[06:56:38] <Innocentus> sorry, my connection
[06:57:15] <suark> Innocentus: http://jsfiddle.net/h3Fce/5/
[06:57:33] <suark> Maybe not the most elegant - but it works for me
[06:57:53] <Innocentus> suark: very nice, thanks
[06:58:04] <g0th> xec: I make a demo that's the simplest way, ouff
[06:58:06] <suark> You're welcome.
[06:58:18] <g0th> but then I pollute my github history with bad commits
[06:58:19] <g0th> anyway
[06:58:44] <xec> g0th: why pollute github? just make a jsfiddle?
[06:58:51] <g0th> xec: basically because moving an object around should change the current time and changing the current time changes the position of the container
[06:59:06] <g0th> of a huge project with movies/etc?
[06:59:30] <xec> no, a small demonstration of your issue
[06:59:42] <xec> surely you don't need the entire project
[06:59:51] <g0th> ouff
[07:00:07] <g0th> this will take much longer than commiting to github
[07:00:15] <g0th> like 100 times longer
[07:00:27] <g0th> I need to setup a whole demo without any template
[07:00:36] <PavelloZ> create a branch :)
[07:00:45] <g0th> already did
[07:00:53] <xec> "a whole demo" shouldnt be more than about 12 lines
[07:00:56] <PavelloZ> so its not polluting if you can delete it afterwards
[07:01:06] <g0th> the commit history remains
[07:01:27] <PavelloZ> even if you dont use no fast-forward?
[07:01:33] <g0th> before I make the demo I will try to figure it out myself again first
[07:01:49] <suark> g0th: can you isolate where the problem is occurring?
[07:01:50] <g0th> ok, it is possible that way
[07:03:20] <g0th> yes
[07:03:42] <g0th> if I comment out line 235,236 in pastebin.com/8XLsfRnS
[07:03:45] <g0th> then it works
[07:04:23] <g0th> those line basically do the following: they change the .left from $(self._bar)
[07:04:32] <g0th> and the draggable is a child of $(self._bar)
[07:05:42] <g0th> basically the draggable should always remain at the same place
[07:05:47] <g0th> and the bar should move
[07:07:32] <g0th> hmm, I have a dirty solution that should work...
[07:08:53] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: ok, now I also want to get the element (this) on which the plugin has been called on: http://jsfiddle.net/h3Fce/7/
[07:09:10] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: but this don't work in the other function - it is undefined - but it is necessary to get it
[07:09:31] <pifantastic> Innocentus: don't use suark's example
[07:09:34] <pifantastic> http://jsfiddle.net/Qjy5y/1/
[07:09:35] <pifantastic> ^
[07:09:38] <pifantastic> use that
[07:10:01] <pifantastic> sorry suark, but your example doesn't make sense
[07:11:43] <suark> That's ok.... I'm learning too.
[07:11:56] <suark> ....but it does work...
[07:12:05] <suark> :)
[07:13:11] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: thank you people for your help :)
[07:14:36] <suark> Innocentus: you're welcome...  not knowing the correct way to do it, I'd be trying to pass variables as much as I could...  also you may wish to be going through as much of the documentation as possible...
[07:16:17] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: where can I store globally used variables? :/
[07:16:28] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: in a plugin
[07:17:18] <suark> where you declare a variable without the var keyword, the variable will be global... but it's probably not the best.... RTFM....
[07:17:21] <pifantastic> Innocentus: http://jsfiddle.net/Qjy5y/2/
[07:17:33] <pifantastic> Look at `foo`
[07:18:08] <pifantastic> Innocentus: if you explain what you want your plugin to do, we may be able to guide you better
[07:18:10] <pifantastic> ?xy
[07:18:11] <bot-t> You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[07:21:23] <suark> Innocentus: maybe if you could be clearer about what you're trying to achieve... (i.e. not such a generic examplee)
[07:37:54] <rns> anyone know if I can put something in document.ready() from outside of the head tags?
[08:06:40] <LukeNukem_> <div style='background-color: #111111; height:600px; width:800px;' class='img_display_holder'><img class='status_img_lightbox' id='status_img_lightbox_"+statusid+" style='margin: 0 auto;' src='"+img+"'/>
[08:06:42] <LukeNukem_> comes up as

[08:12:33] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: I want to access the options variable which has been initialized in init() - but it is undefined when access from another plugin method - why?
[08:19:36] <Innocentus> pifantastic / suark: An idea? :/
[08:20:11] <Hadrian> hi
[08:20:14] <Hadrian> is anybody here?
[08:20:43] <Innocentus> me
[08:20:59] <Hadrian> what are you discussig in this chat room?
[08:29:31] <Innocentus> quite quite now, :)
[08:29:42] <Innocentus> I want to access the options variable which has been initialized in init() - but it is undefined when access from another plugin method - why?
[08:31:36] <adept> hi all. Just looking for people preference really. I'm building a simple slideshow viewer and was thinking of pre-loading. What are peoples preffered methods to do this?
[08:31:51] <adept> on page load, or slideshow init, or when it's called to display images?
[08:32:23] <Hadrian> i'm searching for a girl...
[08:32:36] <craZZter> I'm having a bit of an issue with the fancybox plugin. I load the content using ajax. But events defined using .on() does not seem to be available on the elements in the box. Sorry - I'm pretty much a jquery n00b :-9
[08:33:05] <Hadrian> i'm searching for a girl...
[08:33:39] <craZZter> Hadrian: Not sure jquery would be your best approach...
[08:34:02] <Hadrian> what does jquery mean?
[08:35:39] <Innocentus> oh
[08:36:09] <Innocentus> Hadrian: you are in the wrong channel then, jquery is meant for jquery users and developpers
[08:36:14] <adept> craZZter: Check your jquery version. It could be an old version that didn't support .on(). Otherwise check it's actaully loaded and not conflicting with ovther libs :)
[08:41:06] <craZZter> adept: I'm running latest version. .on() is working just fine. I might not have explained myself too well... If I assign a 'click' event to a button (#foo), and display that button in my fancybox, then the event does not fire when the button is clicked. Normally that's no problem. It seems like the content of the fancybox is somehow moved out in the DOM so the events are not available somehow
[08:46:42] <pifantastic> craZZter: are you assigning the event to the element before the element is created?
[08:46:48] <pifantastic> craZZter: if so, you need to use live()
[08:46:51] <pifantastic> ?live @ craZZter
[08:46:53] <bot-t> craZZter, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:54:30] <craZZter> pifantastic: ohhh yes - ofc! Thx a lot :-)
[09:02:11] <Innocentus_> http://jsfiddle.net/fwtUU/2/
[09:02:25] <Innocentus_> Why isn't the options variable not global for plugin`?
[09:02:33] <Innocentus_> the other variable is
[09:07:10] <pifantastic> Innocentus_: You are using $.extend incorrectly
[09:07:24] <pifantastic> ?extend @ Innocentus_
[09:07:25] <bot-t> Innocentus_, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[09:14:29] <g0th> hi
[09:14:48] <g0th> is it possible to define a container for jquery's draggable object at the start event?
[09:16:03] <Innocentus> http://jsfiddle.net/fwtUU/4/
[09:16:21] <Innocentus> pifantastic: options is undefined
[09:16:47] <pifantastic> Innocentus: And why do you think that is?
[09:17:04] <pifantastic> ?xy @ g0th
[09:17:04] <bot-t> g0th, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[09:24:51] <g0th> pifantastic: I want a horizontal moving element that should only be movable to the left as long as el.left>A and only be movable to the right as long as el.left+el.width>A
[09:26:17] <g0th> the other way round but anyway
[09:26:24] <g0th> moving to the right resp. moving to the left
[09:26:33] <pifantastic> g0th: And you cannot create the container before hand?
[09:26:46] <g0th> A changes very dynamically
[09:27:14] <g0th> but it is fixed during the moveing
[09:27:43] <g0th> I could of course create a container before hand and update it each time any of its parameters change
[09:27:46] <g0th> but that's super ugly
[09:28:32] <pifantastic> g0th: I wonder if you can use the drag event
[09:28:45] <pifantastic> and once you get to a certain point, disable drag
[09:28:52] <pifantastic> either by returning false
[09:28:55] <pifantastic> or triggering a mouseup
[09:29:05] <pifantastic> just a theory though
[09:29:42] <g0th> hmm
[09:29:49] <g0th> but then I would have to grab the element again to move it
[09:30:03] <raj> how does a jquery object .trigger() something? is it only triggered once that object is created?
[09:30:53] <g0th> is it possible to define a container for jquery's draggable object at the start event?
[09:31:25] <pifantastic> g0th: have you tried setting the "containment" property in the start event?
[09:31:35] <g0th> yeah
[09:31:40] <g0th> it didn't work
[09:31:41] <pifantastic> and it doesn't work?
[09:31:43] <pifantastic> hmm
[09:31:48] <g0th> does it need to be in a dom?
[09:32:05] <pifantastic> g0th: you can specify a coordinate window
[09:32:11] <pifantastic> Possible string values: 'parent', 'document', 'window', [x1, y1, x2, y2].
[09:32:18] <pifantastic> Isn't that what you're looking for?
[09:32:24] <g0th> yes kind off
[09:32:37] <g0th> what do I choose for y1/2?
[09:32:48] <g0th> -Infinity and +Infinity?
[09:33:15] <pifantastic> g0th: I would go with 0 and $(document).height()
[09:33:27] <pifantastic> if you want it to be the whole page
[09:33:54] <g0th> hmm, but it is not the page coordinates
[09:33:57] <g0th> right?
[09:34:03] <g0th> I want coordinates relative to the parent
[09:34:30] <g0th> resp. I want to compare the coordinates to el.left/etc
[09:34:32] <pifantastic> my guess is that the coordinates need to be relative to the page
[09:34:46] <pifantastic> so just do the math to determine them with respect to the parent
[09:34:52] <g0th> omg
[09:34:55] <g0th> ok I try
[09:35:03] <g0th> but this is silly/stupid computations
[09:35:24] <pifantastic> If this was easy we wouldnt get paid to do it
[09:43:14] <g0th>               $(this).draggable("option","containment",[-1,-1,1,1]);
[09:43:24] <g0th> (and similarly with "-1px" etc...
[09:43:30] <g0th> this does not do anything
[09:45:21] <g0th> pifantastic: any idea what this array parameter does?
[09:45:40] <g0th> it does not seem to contain anything
[09:46:48] <g0th> ouff
[09:46:59] <g0th> this documentation is so bad, I have to read the source to get anywhere
[09:47:15] <pifantastic> g0th: I looks like you do not need the "px"
[09:49:54] <g0th> in either case it is not working
[09:50:32] <pifantastic> http://jsfiddle.net/GSwkY/
[09:50:33] <pifantastic> g0th:
[09:50:35] <pifantastic> ^
[09:50:39] <pifantastic> that is a simple example
[09:51:05] <pifantastic> it "contains" the draggables to the top left corner in a 300px box
[09:57:34] <g0th> hmm does it take the center position as a basis?
[09:57:42] <g0th> center position with respect to the window
[09:57:47] <pifantastic> g0th: nope, top left
[09:57:53] <pifantastic> top left is 0, 0
[09:58:01] <g0th> it takes the center in my case somehow
[09:58:02] <g0th> hmm
[09:58:20] <g0th> I mean to decide whether the element is contained or not
[09:58:26] <pifantastic> oh
[09:58:40] <pifantastic> then you will need to subtract half your element's width and height from the container
[09:58:48] <pifantastic> to constrain it properly
[09:58:49] <g0th> if that's true
[09:58:59] <g0th> why does nobody write this down in the documentation
[09:59:04] <g0th> it is like the most important thing
[09:59:56] <pifantastic> g0th: I agree, you should file a ticket to half the documentation updated
[10:01:15] <Ring0`> Hello. How in jQuery I merge the [] stuff like if('input[type=checkbox][value=no]')

[10:08:19] <shoky> and what's the prob?
[10:15:34] <Guest17099> shoky i just want an idea on how it can be done ?
[10:15:54] <shoky> step by step?
[10:16:04] <shoky> ?ajax
[10:16:04] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:16:14] <shoky> ?append
[10:16:14] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:16:24] <shoky> ?click
[10:16:24] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[10:16:34] <shoky> those should get you started...
[10:16:58] <Guest17099> awesome...thanks a lot :)
[10:17:13] <shoky> ;)
[10:20:41] <arphen> can i reference a normal function in a .click() bind?
[10:20:46] <arphen> or does it have to be anonymous
[10:20:57] <shoky> you can always use a named function instead of an anonymous one
[10:21:47] <erebel55>  does anyone know how to center a div vertically with js? i'm trying to center the slider in this based on the window height http://jsfiddle.net/erebel55/pwjSG/11/

[10:33:20] <nero_> hi all, what is the best way to set up a reverse proxy to bypass Cross Origin policy on my dev box?
[10:33:48] <nero_> was trying to configure nginx as a reverse proxy but it only seems to be issuing a 301 and redirecting the request instead of proxying it :/
[10:34:08] <antihero> is there a way to serialize a form in a non-retarded way, like an object of name: value?
[10:34:30] <arphen> i think you can parse it to json?
[10:41:59] <arphen> is it possible at all that it makes a difference wether i bind an anonymous function or a named one to my.click?
[10:43:44] <pifantastic> arphen: it depends.
[10:44:12] <Innocentus> pifantastic: I want that options variable is global and initiliazed in init method so it can be used in another method, too
[10:44:34] <pifantastic> Innocentus: last time I looked at your code, you were not using $.extend correctly
[10:44:57] <pifantastic> Innocentus: you were extend defaults with options, but options starts out undefined, so it is essentially a no-op
[10:44:58] <Innocentus> pifantastic: right :) but this has been corrected now
[10:45:05] <pifantastic> cool
[10:45:21] <arphen> pifantastic, could you take a a look at this? http://pastebin.com/n49aYkyT
[10:45:44] <arphen> if you control+f "FUNCTION" you will find an attempt to add a function
[10:45:53] <arphen> it works for the anonymous way, but not for the named way
[10:46:00] <Innocentus> pifantastic: ok, here is the corrected code now - but there is the problem, that options and defaults are both null: http://jsfiddle.net/fwtUU/5/
[10:46:08] <pifantastic> arphen: holy chaining
[10:46:22] <arphen> i asked yesterday if there was any more elegant way to do that
[10:46:29] <arphen> i hate how the code looks
[10:46:33] <arphen> i'm very willing to refactor
[10:47:07] <arphen> i don't see where I'm going wrong with the .click binding
[10:48:31] <pifantastic> Innocentus: I don't think this is the direction you want to go in. The way you've structured your code, the options you pass to test() will apply to every element you've called the .test() plugin on, instead of being unique to each element
[10:48:37] <pifantastic> but whatever the case, http://jsfiddle.net/PxwgG/2/
[10:48:58] <toothr> arphen, why don't you just build a string?
[10:49:20] <pifantastic> Or use templates
[10:49:27] <arphen> i need a unique function for the onclick of the <a> elements
[10:49:28] <toothr> arphen, jQote2 i've used
[10:49:43] <toothr> seemed pretty decent, don't know if there's anything else better
[10:50:00] <arphen> i'd rather stick with few components...
[10:50:27] <toothr> arphen, you can use it to compile a function you include, instead of requiring an extra lib
[10:51:00] <arphen> thank you for your suggestion toothr but i'm trying to find out why i can't bind a named function to .click()
[10:51:09] <jacof> http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/X7Kfu/ <- tipz ?
[10:51:26] <arphen> i can cope with how it looks, it works exactly like i want it to
[10:51:41] <arphen> i can hide the complexity of the code by using folds
[10:51:49] <arphen> the thing is i have the exact same code in multiple places
[10:51:56] <toothr> arphen, jquery also has built in templates now it looks like
[10:52:09] <toothr> no, this is a plugin, sorry.
[10:52:45] <pifantastic> arphen: sorry, what's the problem exactly?
[10:52:51] <arphen> the structure is not my main concern, as mentioned it works exactly like i want it to, i just want to make it a named function instead of an anonymous
[10:52:59] <arphen> search for "FUNCTION"
[10:53:07] <arphen> i have the same function twice
[10:53:15] <arphen> once as an anonymous, once as a named
[10:53:21] <arphen> it only works for the anonymous though
[10:53:24] <Innocentus> pifantastic: so the options should be stored in data of element?
[10:54:10] <pifantastic> Innocentus: That is one approach, yes
[10:54:36] <Innocentus> pifantastic: what would you recommend to me? how do you do such things?
[10:54:37] <arphen> pifantastic, any idea though? ( not trying to be hasty here)
[10:54:59] <pifantastic> arphen: click: addfooter()
[10:55:04] <pifantastic> that does not make sense
[10:55:09] <pifantastic> click requires a function
[10:55:16] <pifantastic> but you are passing it the result of a function
[10:55:30] <pifantastic> a result which happens to === undefined
[10:55:43] <arphen> oh thanks
[10:55:49] <arphen> so i do click: addfooter?
[10:56:09] <arphen> or how do i reference the function
[10:56:10] <pifantastic> If you want addfooter to execute when the element is clicked, yes
[10:56:16] <arphen> <3
[10:56:24] <arphen> it makes so much sense thank you
[10:56:28] <arphen> i feel like i learned something today
[10:56:43] <pifantastic> then it's a good day
[10:56:51] <pifantastic> but I also urge you to read a book on JavaScript
[10:57:03] <pifantastic> because that is a very fundamental thing that you *have* to know
[10:57:46] <arphen> the thing that confused me was that an anonymous function defines with function(){} but the parentheses are just part of the definition
[10:58:25] <arphen> also, wouldn't you agree that learning by doing is the most effective way ?
[10:59:47] <arphen> I've read through lots of books about C/c++/java/python and i've never felt that i learned anywhere nearly as much as with my own projects
[11:01:59] <Innocentus> pifantastic: what would you recommend to me? how do you do such things?
[11:02:01] <arphen> anyway it works <3
[11:03:46] <pifantastic> Innocentus: what do you want this plugin to do/
[11:04:17] <Innocentus> pifantastic: the problem is that plugin got a callback function which calls itself. this function need to be stored somewhere inside the plugin.
[11:04:30] <Innocentus> pifantastic: for each element there can be an own self-calling callback function
[11:04:51] <pifantastic> Innocentus: Explain at a higher level what your plugin is supposed to accomplish
[11:06:02] <Innocentus> pifantastic: the plugin does an animation on an element and then the animation is repeated after completion of first animation and so on
[11:06:24] <g0th> pifantastic: I now wasted half of my day trying to figure out what this container box does
[11:06:29] <g0th> pifantastic: and I still have no clue
[11:06:39] <g0th> it seems I got the left boundary worked out but the right one???
[11:06:53] <g0th> [x,y,w,h] ?
[11:06:58] <pifantastic> g0th: no
[11:07:07] <pifantastic> [x1, y1, x2, y2]
[11:07:13] <g0th> but that also seems wrong
[11:07:14] <pifantastic> x1, y1 is the top left corner
[11:07:17] <g0th> when I test it
[11:07:20] <pifantastic> x2, y2 is the bottom right corner
[11:07:24] <g0th> that's wrong
[11:07:27] <g0th> it does something else
[11:07:36] <pifantastic> g0th: prove it in a fiddle
[11:07:48] <g0th> it is right in the most simple cases
[11:07:50] <pifantastic> I showed you a fiddle that worked perfectly
[11:07:55] <g0th> but when you have several elements within each other
[11:07:59] <g0th> it behaves sooo strange
[11:08:22] <pifantastic> g0th: you have draggable elements within draggable elements?
[11:08:44] <pifantastic> Innocentus: What animation is it doing? And is that animation just supposed to loop forever?
[11:09:11] <g0th> ahh I think I got it
[11:09:37] <g0th> what it does is: the left end of your draggable object must be bigger than the left end of the contain
[11:09:51] <g0th> and the left end of your draggable must never leave the right end of the contain
[11:10:01] <g0th> I thought that the right end must never leave the contain
[11:10:10] <g0th> but apparently it is the left end that cannot leave it
[11:10:18] <g0th> so strange
[11:11:15] <Innocentus> pifantastic: yes, but after the animation finished and before calling itself again, it checks, if the next element has been already downloaded
[11:11:41] <Innocentus> pifantastic: if it hadn't been downloaded,the function exits and the downloaded-handler will restart the function then
[11:12:54] <pifantastic> Innocentus: What do you mean "element has already been downloaded"
[11:13:00] <pifantastic> elements are notâ¦.downloaded
[11:13:26] <Innocentus> pifantastic: in this case they have to be downloaded (images) before they can be used - otherwise the user won't see anything
[11:13:53] <jacof> http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/yhv76/11/ Finally !
[11:14:12] <pifantastic> Innocentus: So it sounds like you actually want to bind a listener to an image element's load function, yes?
[11:14:24] <Doxin> when doing $.post("/api/do_login/",{'username':username, 'password':pass, 'csrfmiddlewaretoken':csrf},do_login,"json") it seems as if only the csrf token actually makes it to the server, the username and password attributes are missing.
[11:15:09] <pifantastic> Doxin: are you sure those variables are defined when you call .post ?
[11:15:23] <Doxin> pifantastic: pretty damn sure.
[11:15:33] <pifantastic> Doxin: you need to be absolutely sure
[11:15:42] <Doxin> pifantastic: wouldn't that trip an error though?
[11:15:48] <pifantastic> Doxin: no
[11:15:52] <tw2113> null variables suck
[11:15:54] <g0th> pifantastic: ok so it is [x1,y1,x1+width(draggable),y1+width(draggable)], but somehow it only works after the second drag, the first drag has no containment
[11:16:16] <Doxin> pifantastic: wtf?
[11:16:18] <g0th> so setting the contain in start is not working
[11:16:20] <Innocentus> pifantastic: but also the animation should be started for already downloaded elements - the download event should only be used if the next element isn ot available
[11:18:44] <Advocated> I'm doing:  var re = new RegExp("^" + this.term, "i") ;  what exactly does the ^ do? "Find any character outside the given set" but what exactly does that mean? It seems to only be matching the start of the word, not the end :S
[11:19:11] <shoky> ^ does that when inside []
[11:19:30] <pifantastic> Doxin: console.log(username, password) *just* before calling $.post
[11:19:48] <Doxin> pifantastic: yeah, I borked there.
[11:19:56] <shoky> in your case it marks the beginning of the string
[11:19:59] <Doxin> pifantastic: javascript has some horrible handling for unset variables
[11:20:01] <pifantastic> Advocated: that is exactly what ^ means, it signifies the beginning of the string
[11:20:14] <pifantastic> Doxin: not if you understand how they work
[11:20:38] <Doxin> pifantastic: i'd like a warning at the very least if i try to use an unset variable
[11:20:50] <Advocated> pifantastic, so how would I make it so it searches the whole string then? tried  var re = new RegExp("^" + this.term + "^" , "i") ;   but that doesnt work
[11:21:05] <pifantastic> Advocated: removed the "^"
[11:21:05] <shoky> ^ is the beginning
[11:21:21] <pifantastic> Advocated: removed both of them actually
[11:21:38] <Advocated> doh, thanks, perfecty
[11:21:41] <Advocated> -y
[11:22:34] <antihero> Is there an easy way to get the ?blah=hi bit after my url?
[11:23:06] <codeputty> ?mdc window.location @ antihero
[11:23:08] <bot-t> antihero, window.location - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[11:23:24] <gnarf> antihero: location.search
[11:32:00] <g0th> pifantastic: arg now it is again not working
[11:32:12] <g0th> pifantastic: it seems to depend highly when the option is called
[11:32:22] <g0th> I wasted like 6 hours on this damn thing
[11:32:26] <g0th> just to figure out the containment
[11:34:18] <Innocentus> pifantastic: but also the animation should be started for already downloaded elements - the download event should only be used if the next element isn ot available
[11:36:55] <g0th> this is just depressing :(
[11:39:34] <rockfruit> if I have a handler url for an autocomplete widget, and I want to update the ?=&= url parameters for the handler url (after .autocomplete() is called) - where can I access the properties of the live autocomplete instance?
[11:39:53] <antihero> codeputty: Can I get it as an object like  {foo: 'bah'} without having to do a bunch of string parsing?
[11:40:46] <m0> Hello, I am looking at the source code for jQuery, and I am trying to figure out how the .on is being done, it is not using any Mutation Events such as DOMNodeInserted, does anyone know how it works? Cause it works when dynamically loaded elements appear on the page.
[11:44:18] <Advocated> I've got 4 elements, and I'm doing: $("#client, #supplier, #employee").css("visibility", "hidden"); and then: $("#pt").css("visibility", "visible"); so i'm basically hiding 3 elements and showing 1. The thing is, those change, so next time i may hide the pt, and show the client. Any idea how I can make this prettier, ie can i make an array of those names, and somehow hide all but that one?
[11:46:44] <Advocated> ie i could make an array of all the elements (so all 4 of them), and then pass the odd one out
[12:01:58] <lejf> anyone got the solution? http://jsfiddle.net/LRj9T/6/
[12:03:41] <FNTom> I'm having issues with an calling a timer within a widget, the timer works fine. I create another widget, the timer works fine, however when I use both timers in both widgets at once, the first one stops being called.
[12:04:59] <FNTom> Is there something wrong with the method I'm using? I think parent might be getting overwritten or something, but not sure how to resolve the issue.
[12:05:03] <FNTom> parent = this; this.options.interval = setInterval(function() { parent.timer(parent); }, 40);
[12:07:46] <scott426> I'm trying to teach myself jquery and javascript. I am having a problem with setting a variable from within a function. See https://gist.github.com/2267148
[12:10:25] <rodyhaddad> scott426, your nested function, the one that set msg to goodbye, is not being executed anywhere :Padd a () after it's closing curly bracket
[12:15:07] <scott426> thanks, i'll give it a try
[12:16:31] <Innocentus> http://jsfiddle.net/fwtUU/4/
[12:16:37] <Innocentus> How can I access the options variable?
[12:16:41] <Innocentus> It won't work this way
[12:21:06] <theCole> Innocentus: it is working -- it is just undefined
[12:21:12] <theCole> because you have not defined it
[12:21:19] <theCole> =D
[12:22:14] <Innocentus> theCole: the init method is called before with options
[12:22:43] <Innocentus> theCole: the other method, which is called afterwards, should be able to access the options
[12:24:33] <Innocentus> theCole: any idea? :
[12:25:34] <Innocentus> anyone an idea? :/
[12:28:59] <theCole> Innocentus: tsting
[12:35:24] <theCole> Innocentus: you define options locally
[12:35:31] <theCole> so when you extend
[12:35:36] <theCole> you are not reaching global scope
[12:36:47] <theCole> Innocentus: init : function( options ) {
[12:36:58] <theCole> that when you $extend in side that method
[12:37:08] <theCole> you are define options locally by adding it as a param
[12:40:15] <Innocentus> theCole: so as pifantastic told me I will have to store the options in data-attribute, right?
[12:40:45] <theCole> there is no absolute way
[12:41:01] <theCole> depends on what you are trying to accomplish
[12:41:22] <theCole> there is no way you HAVE to do it Innocentus
[12:41:41] <theCole> Innocentus: what is your goal here?
[12:42:19] <Innocentus> theCole: there is a callback function which calls itself again and again after some checks - this callback requires option data
[12:43:36] <theCole> so maybe try using some variables and methods other than "test"
[12:43:41] <theCole> because you are getting name collisions here
[12:43:50] <theCole> Innocentus: this is probably why you are confused
[12:44:16] <theCole> Innocentus: you are creating variables and methods and then over riding them and doing something else

[12:57:41] <lejf> anyone got the solution? i want the images to be visible in the gray area when dragged to it.. and i need to have the overflow on the parent div http://jsfiddle.net/LRj9T/6/
[12:57:47] <Doxin> registering an event handler like this: $("body").ajaxError(catch_ajaxerror) doesn't seem to trigger.
[12:59:32] <theCole> Doxin: did you make an ajax request with an error?
[12:59:37] <theCole> Doxin: why put it on the body?
[12:59:47] <theCole> Doxin: probably should put it on a div to display
[13:00:05] <Doxin> theCole: doesn't matter, I just want to log it to the debug console for now.
[13:00:29] <theCole> Doxin: then maybe you didn't get an error
[13:00:34] <theCole> which is why it is not triggering
[13:00:48] <Doxin> theCole: then why isn't the success handler firing?
[13:00:59] <jrockjiggz> Doxin: overflow: hidden is your problem.. why do you need that?
[13:01:10] <Doxin> jrockjiggz: wrong person?
[13:01:28] <theCole> i dunno, Doxin share you code and i can try to see why
[13:01:40] <jrockjiggz> Doxin: yup sorry
[13:01:47] <jrockjiggz> lejf: overflow: hidden is your problem.. why do you need that?
[13:01:52] <Doxin> theCole: https://github.com/dikzak/DoxList/ it's the ajax request in do_login
[13:02:01] <Doxin> theCole: in list/doxlist.js
[13:02:14] <Doxin> theCole: in list/static/doxlist.js even
[13:02:33] <theCole> is there a site where i can see this live?

[13:03:39] <Doxin> theCole: the login view works perfectly fine
[13:03:56] <Doxin> theCole: console.log("sending request") fires, but console.log("got request") doesn't.
[13:05:46] <Doxin> theCole: also, adding the brackets there could potentially run it before the document is ready
[13:06:21] <theCole> Doxin: any particular reason you are using python?
[13:06:32] <theCole> Doxin: unrelated to the issue -- just wondering

[13:07:22] <theCole> Doxin: ever heard of node.js and couchdb?
[13:07:40] <Doxin> theCole: nope, and i don't really care either \o/
[13:07:42] <Doxin> anyways, bbl
[13:07:48] <Doxin> theCole: thanks for the halp so far

[13:48:33] <adept-phil> hi all. I'm building a custom image fading slideshow and need advice with my preloading feature. I know how to preload individual images by creating an img element and then assigning an src and using .lodaed() before placing in the DOM, however I'm a little confused as how to achieve this with an object of images. Can anyone help?
[13:49:17] <jedimind> with an object of images?
[13:50:02] <adept-phil> sorry, array
[13:50:17] <adept-phil> long day lol
[13:51:39] <adept-phil> when my slideshow viewport is brought into view, I display a preloading overlay by default whilst I preload images. I want to remove the pre-loader once all of them images have loaded.
[13:54:26] <adept-phil> if I use .each will it wait for the current image to preload beofre moving to the next iteration of the .each()?
[13:54:52] <Doxin> theCole: I don't care for this project
[13:55:10] <adept-phil> eg imageArray.each( /*  code to preload this current image */ );
[13:55:11] <theCole> Doxin: fair enough
[13:55:47] <Doxin> theCole: the odd thing about my problem is that I can see the request happen and finish successfully in the chrome inspector.
[13:59:18] <Doxin> theCole: any idea why the success handler wouldn't be called even if the request finishes successfully
[13:59:20] <Doxin> ?
[14:02:28] <theCole> Doxin: nah i did not try to replicate it since i did not feel like setting up python on my machine
[14:02:34] <theCole> try doing it like the query examples
[14:02:37] <theCole> jquery
[14:02:54] <Doxin> theCole: hmm
[14:02:58] <theCole> Doxin: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:03:03] <theCole> =P
[14:03:16] <Doxin> theCole: mine isn't too much different from that, is it?
[14:03:51] <theCole> h/o maybe i can pull your stuff out to jsfiddle
[14:06:20] <Doxin> theCole: oh! it seems that i'm using malformed json :I
[14:06:39] <Doxin> ffs
[14:06:51] <Doxin> theCole: protip: don't use single quotes in json.
[14:07:08] <theCole> lol
[14:07:52] <Doxin> damnit
[14:09:13] <theCole> Doxin: so did that fix it?
[14:10:04] <Doxin> theCole: yes.
[14:10:13] <theCole> Doxin: nice

[14:24:40] <raj> vesan, why?
[14:24:55] <raj> there are only 2 $selected's

[14:25:25] <vesan> forever until it errors out
[14:25:27] <raj> how can I do this then?

[14:31:31] <raj> for real?
[14:32:15] <vesan> it's related to this http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Why-does-Internet-Explorer-block-some-file-downloads

[14:32:30] <vesan> "By design, non-user-initiated file downloads are blocked in IE. That inherently means that it should not be possible to download more than one file as the result of a single user-click."

[14:35:28] <vesan> that open two new browser windows so it might work depending on your case
[14:36:28] <raj> nice vesan
[14:36:43] <raj> so if that's a download, it'll work?
[14:36:57] <raj> (without opening a new tab)
[14:37:06] <vesan> I'm not really sure if it works
[14:37:34] <vesan> might work nicely if Content-Disposition is attachment in HTTP headers

[14:55:38] <sec^nd> ntry: I'm using this atm $('input[name="files[]"]').val()
[14:55:53] <sec^nd> should I use this instead $('input[name="files"]').val() ?
[14:55:59] <sec^nd> name of input is files[]
[14:56:13] <ntry> yes, but val only gives you the firs element
[14:56:19] <ntry> try each()
[14:56:30] <ntry> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[14:57:03] * sec^nd remebers trying each before but will try again
[14:57:54] <ntry> $('input[type="file"']).each(function(){ $(this).val(); });
[14:58:01] <ntry> should work
[14:59:37] <jedimind> you cannot extrude the value of a file input type
[14:59:42] <jedimind> for security reasons
[15:00:02] <sec^nd> ntry: I still only get one file
[15:00:09] <sec^nd> jedimind: what ?
[15:00:10] <jedimind> iirc
[15:00:15] <sec^nd> and why not ?
[15:00:15] <Schyzo> Hello everyone
[15:00:18] <jedimind> oh you cant set it, but you can read it
[15:00:19] <jedimind> nevermind
[15:01:02] <ntry> sec^nd: can you send me a link?
[15:01:27] <sec^nd> not really :/
[15:01:37] <sec^nd> going to pastie
[15:01:47] <Schyzo> I have an issue when trying to setup a simple call with ajax: I have a button doing an ajax request and it gets a json response. So far so good, but I need to update the ajax call once completed (a click on the same button will not request the same url)
[15:02:04] <jedimind> and even when reading, i think you can only get the file name, not the full path to file
[15:02:23] <Schyzo> It seems I can't manage to call the function again as I am going through a loop here... Would somebody have an idea ?
[15:03:55] <Schyzo> http://pastie.org/3705755
[15:04:55] <sec^nd> http://pastebin.ca/2134372
[15:04:58] <sec^nd> ntry: ^
[15:06:37] <ntry> $('input[type="file"]')
[15:06:45] <ntry> ] missing
[15:08:21] <ntry> and there is only one input in your code
[15:08:29] <ntry> sec^nd: ^
[15:09:16] <sec^nd> ntry: thats what I'm trying to do
[15:09:27] <sec^nd> ntry: its a file input that accepts multiple selected files
[15:09:40] <ntry> ah
[15:09:49] <ntry> hm
[15:10:05] <ntry> ok then each is not what you need
[15:12:05] <sec^nd> ntry: so any other ideas ?
[15:14:20] <sec^nd> I want to use this http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[15:14:33] <sec^nd> but I'm not sure how to use it on the page or the server side
[15:17:08] <ntry> i just wrote a testcase, looks like there is no other way
[15:18:23] <ntry> hehe i like the path from chrome C:\fakepath\testpic1.png
[15:18:33] <sec^nd> mhm
[15:18:47] <sec^nd> somehow jquery file upload is doing it
[15:18:50] <ntry> well looks like you only get the first value
[15:18:55] <ntry> yes
[16:08:16] <ihdev> hey guys, I have a backbonejs + jquery ui question. I am trying to create a "meeting app" where you drag people into a meeting using jquery UI droppable. How do I update the meeting model using the even triggered by the dropt? (i.e. the meeting model starts off with an empty array of "in attendance" and needs to be updated when someone adds a person by dropping them)
[16:08:45] <ShaunR> is it possible to identify an element by it's content?  for example i need to grab an <a> with the word stuff in it?
[16:10:39] <instance_eval> ShaunR: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[16:15:43] <shoky> ihdev, i dont rly know backbonejs, but it sounds like you should just add that person to the empty array in your viewmodel
[16:18:30] <ihdev> shoky, I think the challenge is I don't know backbone too well either :p
[16:18:36] <ihdev> haha
[16:18:47] <shoky> ;p
[16:18:59] <shoky> i use knockoutjs
[16:19:05] <shoky> loving it
[16:19:49] <shoky> there i'd just .push(new Person(...)) to the observable array in the model
[16:20:04] <shoky> and then magic ensues
[16:35:46] <ihdev> shoky, yeah knockout is pretty sexy. i haven't played with it much - don't love that the data is bound to html but in this case it may not be a bad idea
[16:41:55] <g0th> hi
[16:42:29] <shoky> hy
[16:43:00] <g0th> can someone explain me all those parameters of jquery's draggable plugin? like ui.position, ui.originalPosition, ui.offset, e.pageX, etc?
[16:43:34] <g0th> when I move resp. drag an option that is contained within some big container
[16:43:59] <g0th> e.pageX is the x-coordinate of my mouse with respect to window?
[16:44:57] <g0th> is that the same as ui.position + $(theparent).offset().left ?
[16:45:41] <g0th> no matter what I try I always get a very strange behaviour where the draggable object is getting further and further away from the mouse
[16:47:18] <g0th> I should note that the container changes its position during teh dragging
[16:49:35] <g0th> is there a good documentation about the dragging plugin anywhere?
[16:56:00] <shoky> jsfiddle yer problem
[17:08:42] <RudyValencia> How do I remove a CSS :hover declaration with jQuery so that it can take over the duty of handling a dropdown's hovers?
[17:10:33] <jovrtn> don't think you'll be able to turn off the hover pseudo-class since jquery/JS can't access them (they're not part of the DOM)
[17:10:59] <jovrtn> you could do something like
[17:11:15] <jovrtn> give your body tag a .jquery class
[17:11:27] <jovrtn> or rather a .no-jquery
[17:11:38] <jovrtn> and use that in any selector that has a :hover psuedo-class
[17:12:19] <RudyValencia> I could just put that on the div the hovers are in and then have jquery remove the no-jquery class too, right?
[17:12:59] <jovrtn> right
[17:15:49] <erebel55> is something like this possible?
[17:15:49] <erebel55> â$("#symbol").attr("position",Â $("#âââbox0").âââââââââââââââââââââââposition());â
[17:15:53] <erebel55> it doesn't seem to be working
[17:17:41] <jovrtn> you mean the css position property?
[17:18:06] <jovrtn> you'd do something like
[17:18:17] <jovrtn> .css('top',$("#âââbox0").âââââââââââââââââââââââposition().top)
[17:20:19] <erebel55> ahh duh css sorry don't know why i used attr
[17:20:29] <erebel55> ahh ok, i didn't know if i could do the entire position structure at once
[17:20:31] <erebel55> that will work tho
[17:20:32] <erebel55> thanks
[17:21:17] <jovrtn> np
[17:32:31] <atlas_> is there someway to make .select() work on regular text (non inputs) ?
[17:34:46] <jovrtn> atlas_: found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985272/jquery-selecting-text-in-an-element-akin-to-highlighting-with-your-mouse
[17:36:42] <atlas_> jovrtn: thanks! that looks interesting...just reading it now. What I'm trying to do is have the user highlight any text on the page and when they do so, a button appears by the text
[17:36:56] <jovrtn> ahh
[17:37:17] <jovrtn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732396/highlighted-text-popup-widget-what-to-call-it-and-where-to-find-the-javascrip
[17:37:20] <atlas_> kind of like on iOS when you highlight text, some options appear above the text (Copy, paste, etc)
[17:37:23] <jovrtn> lots of stuff comes for that when i googles
[17:38:12] <atlas_> ahhh yes that link looks good - it really is kind of like a tooltip, but it triggers on highlighting the text
[17:39:55] <atlas_> jovrtn: does .select() work on regular text?
[17:40:25] <atlas_> ..or only inputs?
[17:40:54] <jovrtn> from the docs: The select event is sent to an element when the user makes a text selection inside it. This event is limited to <input type="text"> fields and <textarea> boxes.
[17:42:33] <atlas_> hmmm yea, damn. Is there any event that checks for regular highlighted text?
[17:45:47] <jovrtn> check out the document.selection object
[17:46:44] <atlas_> thanks jovrtn, checking it out, seems to work ok actually
[17:46:58] <jovrtn> cool
[17:47:05] <jovrtn> good luck with your script :)
[17:50:39] <atlas_> jovrtn: the document.selection methods works well, but it seems to trigger on any click: http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:51:08] <atlas_> woops, sorry real link coming
[17:51:33] <atlas_> http://jsfiddle.net/vvMjP/
[17:56:02] <ihdev> in backbone js - how do I target a specific model based on a click (i.e. clicking on a delete span in an <li> deletes that model, which should auto update the view)
[17:58:05] <ihdev> think of a people list. in my events in the view I have "click span.destroy"        : "clearPerson" - what should I write into the clearPerson() function?
[17:59:16] <jovrtn> atlas_: you need some logic in the click handler to check whether a selection has been made
[18:01:01] <atlas_> jovrtn: ahhhh...right...im so bad with this stuff. do you do freelance work for this kind of stuff?
[18:01:50] <jovrtn> yeah I do contracted work mostly
[18:02:47] <atlas_> are you on skype? maybe we can arrange something..
[18:03:18] <jovrtn> sure, though there are probably a few prepackaged scripts that already do what you're trying to achieve
[18:04:03] <atlas_> there's actually a bigger picture here ... but would require some explanation, lol ... whats ur name on skype?
[18:04:12] <jovrtn> same
[18:05:04] <atlas_> awesome, catch you there
[18:09:06] <Lonestar99> howdy folks

[18:16:49] <Lonestar99> freaking cable connection -->need to disable a click event when pagination reaches the end... is there an event to disable "click" of an element?
[18:17:07] <coldhead> ?off
[18:17:08] <bot-t> coldhead, .off() - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[18:17:11] <coldhead> ?unbind
[18:17:11] <bot-t> .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[18:17:55] <Lonestar99> unbind or off?
[18:18:51] <coldhead> Lonestar99: how did you bind it?
[18:18:57] <coldhead> if you used on, use off
[18:19:06] <coldhead> if you're a caveman using click or bind, use unbind
[18:19:47] <Lonestar99> yeah click
[18:20:06] <Lonestar99> $("#foo").click();
[18:20:22] <coldhead> unbind then
[18:20:35] <Lonestar99> k testing rhanks
[18:23:44] <Lonestar99> coldhead i used the following --> $("#bb,#pv,#nx,#lg").click(function(stt) { ... });
[18:24:57] <coldhead> $("#bb,#pv,#nx,#lg").unbind('click')
[18:25:07] <Lonestar99> ok thnaks
[18:25:14] <coldhead> those are terrible IDs :)
[18:25:25] <coldhead> i couldn't begin to guess what any of them do
[18:25:53] <Lonestar99> yeah it is cryptic , gona distribute the code
[18:27:39] <coldhead> so you're making it deliberately unreadable?
[18:27:42] <coldhead> that's sad :(

[19:26:12] <f0rkn1ght> Randomage, if($(this).attr("checked")){} something like that
[19:26:21] <martisj> morning
[19:26:46] <Randomage> I meant the event.
[19:26:58] <Randomage> It seems that change is the right one.
[20:05:08] <Lonestar99> howdy why do the following .on() and .off() not work correctly--> http://jsfiddle.net/3qtLe/1/
[20:13:47] <shoky> you didn't specify any event handler
[20:13:55] <shoky> ?on @ Lonestar99
[20:13:56] <bot-t> Lonestar99, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:16:30] <Lonestar99> bot-t:  i tried bind and unbind and got the same results...
[20:16:34] <bot-t> Lonestar99, .undelegate() - Remove a handler from the event for all elements which match the current selector, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/
[20:16:36] <Lonestar99> gonna try something
[20:21:38] <Lonestar99> bot-t using latest jquery
[20:21:47] <shoky> lonestar, you're talking to a bot
[20:21:55] <Lonestar99> oh lol
[20:21:58] <shoky> i answered your question
[20:22:01] <shoky> <shoky> you didn't specify any event handler
[20:22:41] <Lonestar99> k event handler ... k will read the link
[20:23:08] <shoky> .on('click', function(event) { /* click event handler code.. */ })
[20:23:29] <Hornet-> is there a selector that matches <option> content?
[20:23:40] <Lonestar99> shoky:  what if i am not using a function... what event handler do I add?
[20:23:41] <Hornet-> eg I need to find all option tags with text 'foo'
[20:24:05] <Hornet-> it's not an attribute, so that won't work :\
[20:24:05] <shoky> Lonestar99 why are you using .on?
[20:24:57] <Hornet-> :contains
[20:25:47] <Lonestar99> not sure, b/c i used bind and unbind and got the same results
[20:26:06] <shoky> Lonestar99, then why were you using bind
[20:26:17] <shoky> you want something to happen on click?
[20:27:09] <shoky> an event handler has to be a function
[20:28:03] <Lonestar99> what i want to do is enable  .click on pagination and .click off when user reaches the last page...
[20:30:03] <shoky> that depends how you initially set up the click handling..
[20:30:33] <shoky> anyway, $('#pv').on('click')   doesn't do anything
[20:32:30] <fris> shoky you need a variable for data
[20:33:24] <fris> $('#pv').on("click", function(event){
[20:33:24] <fris> etc
[20:40:28] <Lonestar99> this is still incorrrect right --> $("#bb,#pv,#nx,#lg").unbind('click'); ??
[20:41:40] <abjorn> Crap, I've run out of Top gear episodes. WHAT AM I GONNA WATCH ON NETFLIX NOW?!
[20:48:56] <Hornet-> abjorn: disregard top gear, acquire anime
[21:05:20] <Rinthe> can i use the .attr to replace content in 'href' ?
[21:06:16] <systemfault> Yep.
[21:06:29] <systemfault> Would have taken less time to just try itâ¦.
[21:11:14] <blendedbychris> is there a framework of sorts that that allows for periodic "refetching" of elements (say a div) via ajax given some expiry (maybe a data-expires attribute)
[21:11:20] <blendedbychris> s/that/
[21:11:38] <astropirate> blendedbychris, yes
[21:11:43] <astropirate> setIntervel()
[21:11:51] <blendedbychris> astropirate: heh okay :)
[21:11:54] <astropirate> :p
[21:12:08] <blendedbychris> didn't know if anyone made some fancy framework to do it already
[21:12:17] <blendedbychris> library/plugin/whatev
[21:12:31] <astropirate> thee might... people write frameworks for everything...
[21:12:34] <astropirate> specially in JS
[21:12:39] <astropirate> its both healthy and non healthy
[21:14:29] <blendedbychris> astropirate: if i am going to build this do you think it'd be better if i had several setInterval timers going for each element i want to expire or just one timer at a given interval?
[21:14:33] <blendedbychris> performance-wise
[21:14:53] <blendedbychris> i'd say i would have about 6 timers max
[21:17:09] <abjorn> Hornet-: I've watched all of the good anime on Netflix, already. There isn't much, unfortunately, most of it's shit.
[21:17:14] <blendedbychris> and if they are called at the same time would they just be sequentially called? (I read that js is single threaded etc)
[21:18:02] <Hornet-> abjorn, tbh that doesn't surprise me much
[21:18:08] <Hornet-> netflix are hardly discerning
[21:18:16] <astropirate> blendedbychris, I'd just make multiple. and yes indeed JS is single threaded
[21:18:46] <astropirate> But.. I don't believe its guarenteed that they will be called in the order they were registered
[21:18:51] <abjorn> Hornet-: It doesn't help that I think most anime is shit.
[21:19:13] <blendedbychris> astropirate: not so sure that that is necessaryâ¦.. as long as it doesn't somehow mix up two separate function calls
[21:19:22] <Hornet-> well, it depends what you think of as 'anime'
[21:19:38] <Hornet-> most stuff people are exposed to IS shit
[21:19:44] <Hornet-> eg bleach, naruto, etc
[21:20:04] <blendedbychris> astropirate: well anyhoo thanks for the direction :)
[21:20:11] <abjorn> bleach manga is good, up until they beat aizen and it all just got very, very boring moreofthesame kinda thing.
[21:20:17] <blendedbychris> i'll cross the "clash" rode if/when it happens
[21:20:55] <Hornet-> anything that goes on for that long goes into cash cow territory, and it becomes a revenue stream rather than a story
[21:21:08] <blendedbychris> oh on a side noteâ¦ can I query for any element that has a data-expires attribute?
[21:22:03] <Hornet-> https://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/looflirpa/ here we go...
[21:22:30] <blendedbychris> like $('.data-expires') â¦.. (but the attribute)
[21:23:33] <blendedbychris> ooh nm attribute selector would work just fine
[21:37:43] * aashrith slaps aashrith around a bit with a large trout
[21:43:10] <blendedbychris> does data() get data-role attribute as well or do i have to use attr ?
[21:43:18] <blendedbychris> like data('role')
[21:43:54] <blendedbychris> ahâ¦ indeed it doesn't
[21:47:16] <Eviltwin> Um... it does
[21:47:49] <blendedbychris> oh ?
[21:48:07] <blendedbychris> oh dang i read some outdate info
[21:48:22] <blendedbychris> Regarding HTML5 data-* attributes: This low-level method does NOT retrieve the data-*attributes unless the more convenient http://api.jquery.com/data method has already retrieved them.
[21:48:54] <blendedbychris> so specifically jQuery.data() wont?
[21:49:00] <blendedbychris> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[21:49:33] <blendedbychris> on a side note why doesn't $('[data-expires]') give me all elements with that attribute?
[21:50:10] <Eviltwin> blendedbychris: Are you saying that you've added data-* attributes after using .data()
[21:50:23] <Eviltwin> It says it fetches them the first time you use .data() but not after
[21:50:58] <blendedbychris> i have data-expires="â¦" from the intial load of my elements
[21:51:34] <blendedbychris> should i access it with .attr('data-expires') or .data('expires')
[21:52:06] <Eviltwin> .data('expires')
[21:52:25] <Eviltwin> The DOM shouldn't be used to store data, only, perhaps, to communicate the initial state
[21:52:52] <Eviltwin> Which is why .data('expires', ...) doesn't store the data as an attribute
[21:53:02] <blendedbychris> that's fine.
[21:53:14] <blendedbychris> that is indeed what i am doingâ¦ initial stateâ¦ f
[21:53:31] <blendedbychris> data('expires') works well
[21:53:39] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[21:53:40] <blendedbychris> any idea why that attribute selector won't work?
[21:53:51] <blendedbychris> $('[data-expires]')
[21:54:04] <blendedbychris> oh it does :(

[22:03:51] <eboy> Lonestar99: Oh really? Tell me more
[22:04:18] <eboy> I'm the right person to be your business partner
[22:04:18] <Lonestar99> it is not a social startup, more of a business tool...  http://buildasearch.com
[22:04:28] <eboy> I have whipped up peoples' ideas very quickly in the past.
[22:04:58] <eboy> A facebook clone (4 days), a flickr-like photo sharing web site (3 days), and a Google-like seach engine (2 weeks - longer because you have to stop spam!)
[22:05:47] <Lonestar99> sweet
[22:06:16] <eboy> That's a nice idea you have, looks useful
[22:06:21] <eboy> I'm sure you have more awesome ideas
[22:07:43] <eboy> lol
[22:07:49] <rodyhaddad_> XD
[22:09:31] <Lonestar99> user pastes a few lines of html stuff
[22:17:51] <mo0nykit1> Does jQuery have a convenience function that returns an jQuery object from a jQuery array, without having to use the $(arr[idx]) notation? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/574367/
[22:18:04] <Eviltwin> mo0nykit1: see ?eq
[22:18:04] <bot-t> mo0nykit1, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[22:18:59] <mo0nykit1> Eviltwin: Thank you
[22:20:36] <abjorn> Damn you, adblock, and your cat pictures.
[22:21:13] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/145UsXNk there are multiple .post img on a page, i just want it to show the .meta-bar for each .post. But this makes it so that all .meta-bar are shown even without hovering, ideas?
[22:23:34] <Eviltwin> Try doing $('.meta-bar').hide() before this
[22:24:06] <Rinthe> Eviltwin: in both functions?
[22:25:08] <Eviltwin> No before line 1 in your paste
[22:25:30] <Eviltwin> Or after line 8 should work too
[22:25:58] <Rinthe> Eviltwin: I added it before, it hides the bar, but when i hover over image, it doesnt show up
[22:26:11] <Eviltwin> Rinthe: What does your HTML structure look like?
[22:27:02] <Rinthe> <div class="post"><a href=""><img></a> <div class="meta-bar"></div> </div>
[22:27:25] <Eviltwin> Do you know what .closest does?
[22:27:42] <Rinthe> finds the closest element right
[22:27:46] <Eviltwin> No
[22:28:00] <Rinthe> oh...
[22:28:03] <Eviltwin> Finds the closest ancestor of an element
[22:28:10] <Eviltwin> That matches the selector
[22:28:12] <mo0nykit1> How do I test if a jQuery query matches an element in the DOM? Boolean($("#does_not_exist")) always returns true
[22:28:32] <Eviltwin> $("#does_not_exist").length > 0
[22:28:39] <Eviltwin> Or simply if($("#does_not_exist").length) { ... }
[22:28:43] <Rinthe> Eviltwin: so what should i use?
[22:28:46] <mo0nykit1> thanks..
[22:29:06] <Eviltwin> Rinthe: I would suggest .closest('.post').find('.meta-bar')
[22:30:17] <Rinthe> Eviltwin: worked great, thank you!
[22:45:24] <Stuffness> I'm guessing the answer is no, but is there any way for a js script to know its script tag src url?
[22:45:33] <Eviltwin> No
[22:46:04] <Stuffness> thanks
[22:46:04] <Eviltwin> All scripts in a page become part of the same runtime
[22:46:08] <Eviltwin> There's only one scope
[22:46:11] <Stuffness> yep that's what I figured
[23:23:37] <Validatorian> anyone know what the correct way to code this is? http://jsfiddle.net/KujHt/
[23:42:06] <ircleuser> hi everyone
[23:48:45] <blendedbychris> is it possible to see timeout timers?
[23:49:30] <astropirate> blendedbychris, what do you mean
[23:49:40] <blendedbychris> actually i got the id can i get information about a timer?
[23:49:45] <blendedbychris> like duration or something?
[23:50:00] <astropirate> not sure
[23:50:02] <astropirate> checkout MDN
[23:50:15] <astropirate> for its properties and methods
[23:53:48] <r0ver> Hello. At my work we have spent the whole last month thinking how should be the web and i'd like to share the result with you: http://t.co/HM15BtnS we call it web4.0  or postSemanticHyperGalacticWeb - we started a twitter campaing, join us, look for #postSemanticHyperGalacticWeb hashtag and retweet it, thanks!
[23:54:40] <oksushi> needs more gifs
[23:55:35] <r0ver> it is imposible to make all the people happy, some says a marquee is missing, now more gifs... :D
[23:56:08] <oksushi> put it on the features list for web 5.0
[23:57:31] <blendedbychris> does this look right? http://pastie.textmate.org/private/wr3vtxg1jswyaqrgh8etyq << for some reason that setTimeout() doesn't call the function inside of it
[23:57:47] <r0ver> oksushi: that's a good one1
[23:58:26] <blendedbychris> I get an id for .data('timer')
[23:58:46] <blendedbychris> oh wait
[23:59:28] <blendedbychris> expires is just an epoch timeâ¦ needs to be the differences between now and epoc
[23:59:48] <landypro> blendedbychris, is setTimeout being called?
