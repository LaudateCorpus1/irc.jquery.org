[11:22:33] <rapidwave> Looking to use jquery grid for spreadsheet. documentation is a little vague. Is plain object just any defined object?
[11:23:17] <rapidwave> The example looks like it's just a basic empty object
[11:28:52] <rapidwave> I copied the example, now console says pqGrid does not exist https://gist.github.com/ojabi/6b4043af207190a2174feb56322ca1d9
[11:40:54] <rapidwave> Got it! I was referencing jquery more than once. Now the grid is showing up.
[11:41:24] <rapidwave> Now to figure out how to have save buttons
[16:25:17] <chazy> hi, i'm using css('animation-play-sate', 'paused'); to stop or resume a css animation, but i'd like an smooth slow down transition, i tried changing the 'animation-duration' but it resets the whole animation
[16:25:23] <chazy> is there another way of doing this?
[16:25:52] <robertmaxrees> "an smooth slow down transition"?
[16:25:56] <robertmaxrees> mind being more specific?
[16:26:27] <robertmaxrees> (a jsfiddle showing what you're talking about would be a big help)
[16:30:10] <chazy> https://jsfiddle.net/rspeugc3/
[16:30:41] <chazy> when i click the car img i want the background animation to stop but slowing down
[16:31:01] <robertmaxrees> "top stop but slowing down"?
[16:31:15] <chazy> yes, instead of instantly stopping
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean instead of stopping, you want them to decelerate.
[16:31:25] <robertmaxrees> this is a CSS question :)
[16:32:05] <chazy> hmm yes it should be possible by adding a class or something but isn't there a way to trigger it with jquery?
[16:32:17] <robertmaxrees> you're using jquery to edit CSS.
[16:32:50] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/ease-out-in-ease-in-out/ you're looking for info on easing, either way: https://css-tricks.com/ease-out-in-ease-in-out/
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> ask for more info in #css :)
[16:38:22] <chazy> thanks, i'll ask there
[20:09:35] <chazy> any idea what this error is? Uncaught TypeError: S.easing[this.easing] is not a function from jquery.min.js:2:57887 (3.5.1)
[20:10:17] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't have an easing function/method.
[20:10:50] <chazy> is it a bug?
[20:10:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:11:01] <robertmaxrees> something is trying to call the easing function.
[20:11:12] <chazy> well, this line is triggering that error: $( '#car' ).toggle( "bounce", { times: 1 }, "slow" );
[20:12:10] <robertmaxrees> ah, that's likely an easing jquery doesn't support out of the box.
[20:12:10] <chazy> wouldn't that be a bug?
[20:12:37] <chazy> oh my bad it's from jquery UI
[21:53:28] <impliednude> okay, so I am using the numbers library for jquery. Something weird is happening on my system, on jsfiddle the same code I use it shows comma's. however, on my server it isn't. What might be causing it?
[21:54:19] <robertmaxrees> when you say "on jsfiddle" and "on my server", are you accessing the page from the same computer?
[21:55:00] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> I am accessing from the same computer
[21:55:07] <robertmaxrees> no clue then without seeing it.
[21:55:40] <impliednude> I am just wondering if there might be a reason that its partially working on server but fully on jsfiddle
[21:55:50] <impliednude> aka, where should I Start my debugging at
[21:55:53] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it, i have literally no way to know.
[21:56:03] <robertmaxrees> not even sure i've ever heard of that plugin or what it does.
[21:57:15] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> makes it very easy to format to locale and render currency
[21:57:43] <impliednude> its basically $(.classname).number(true, 2) and will format all within said classname without any issues normally
[21:57:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[21:58:10] <robertmaxrees> there are other, built-in ways to handle that.
[21:58:25] <impliednude> are any of them able to do it with 1 line of code clientside?
[21:58:42] <robertmaxrees> why would the number of lines matter?
[21:58:55] <impliednude> because I am a newbie with javascript
[21:59:04] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[21:59:59] <robertmaxrees> as far as troubleshooting, maybe you're loading something one one and not the other, like some css or something.  maybe you're not loading the plugin correctly somewhere.  maybe there's a js error preventing the plugin from running correctly.
[22:00:25] <robertmaxrees> did you check to make sure you're not getting any errors or 404s?
[22:01:59] <impliednude> no 404's or the like
[22:02:14] <impliednude> I am using requirejs since its required on the system to load it
[22:02:54] <impliednude> the lib doesn't need any external files besides the js and a sourcemap
[22:03:04] <impliednude> both loaded properly and after jquery
[22:04:08] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[22:06:49] <impliednude> I know I could do regex to change it.
[22:06:58] <impliednude> Seen plenty online to do so.
[22:07:05] <robertmaxrees> internationalization is built-in to the browser.
[22:07:30] <robertmaxrees> and there are a ton of tools to support it.
[22:08:10] <robertmaxrees> the only jquery plugin i can find called 'numbers' is like 6 years old - that the one you're using?
[22:08:57] <impliednude> it came with magento 2 and yep
[22:09:17] <impliednude> and I know I could do toLocaleString right to convert it to commas right?
[22:10:54] <robertmaxrees> that gets into ##javascript territory :)  though i gotta ask - why do this client-side?  do you expect to need different ones?
[22:12:51] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> yep. its a world wide business -sighs- also it needs to be dynamic based on input from a input box
[22:13:19] <robertmaxrees> this an ecom operation?
[22:13:23] <impliednude> yep
[22:13:40] <impliednude> if the customer put in 10 pallets, I needed to convert it over whatever standard the clientside uses
[22:13:40] <robertmaxrees> then client-side jquery plguins are a bad call.
[22:14:05] <impliednude> the actual ecom portion is handled via php
[22:14:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to have the user set their locale, attach that to their session, and have your backend handle all this logic.
[22:14:54] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> lets say that I am dynamically showing the customer what each pallet will weigh, as well as volume.
[22:15:18] <impliednude> none of those values are fed into the system at all
[22:15:24] <robertmaxrees> it should.
[22:15:46] <impliednude> I mean nothing the customer does has an effect on the backend operations
[22:15:55] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm saying it should :)
[22:16:00] <impliednude> anything that does is handled by the system already
[22:16:07] <robertmaxrees> your backend should be sending that data to the client.
[22:16:07] <impliednude> why? if a customer puts in and wants an estimate
[22:16:32] <impliednude> its more of a pamphlet than anything
[22:16:43] <impliednude> that estimate
[22:16:44] <robertmaxrees> can the user add to cart?
[22:17:05] <robertmaxrees> either way, you want to let your backend handle things like calculations, especially when dealing with different currencies and the like.
[22:17:15] <impliednude> its not nust currencies
[22:17:20] <impliednude> its weights and volumes
[22:17:22] <robertmaxrees> hence "and the like"
[22:17:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:17:53] <impliednude> if a customer requires 200 pallets, and wants to know the volume, based on multiplication
[22:18:06] <impliednude> js is just fine
[22:18:21] <robertmaxrees> lol okay then :)
[22:18:24] <robertmaxrees> what would i know?
[22:19:11] <impliednude> tell me the downfall of using javascript to perform a simple calculation?
[22:19:39] <impliednude> especially if that value isn't used anywhere else
[22:19:54] <impliednude> the only value that gets added to the cart is how many pallets or items
[22:20:03] <impliednude> not the volume
[22:20:12] <robertmaxrees> console.log(1.1 * 3.2);
[22:20:45] <impliednude> no fractions. item * quantity
[22:20:51] <robertmaxrees> okie.
[22:22:29] <robertmaxrees> so no tax calculations happeninbg?
[22:22:39] <impliednude>  nope not in javascript
[22:23:19] <robertmaxrees> alright.  guess i'm used to having to check quantities and taxes and things.
[22:24:38] <impliednude> the sites basically a way of handling the influx of orders, it gets sent via json to a 3rd parties erp. they call to confirm with the customer and finalize all that stuff with them.
[22:25:06] <impliednude> The e-com is just to streamline the business and reduce the work overall on that end.
[22:25:18] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  yeah, if we misrepresented anything to our customers, etc, we get into deeeeep shit.  just trying to help you avoid pitfalls :)
[22:25:26] <impliednude> yeah.
[22:26:00] <impliednude> anything like volume its easy with javascript overall. or estimate on price, or how much it will weigh
[22:26:14] <impliednude> all simple multiplication and the like
[22:26:26] <impliednude> hence why I went with javascript for that
[22:26:31] <impliednude> 4 lines of code
[22:26:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's the concern for me :) if decimals are at all involved, i get away from js and/or make sure to use an up-to-date library to handle it.
[22:27:06] <robertmaxrees> if you don't expect decimals, then you're g2g :)
[22:27:19] <impliednude> yeah, thankfully no decimals hehe.
[23:17:33] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3L9vokn1/1/ figured it out
[23:22:52] <robertmaxrees> :) didn't want to polyfill https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat ?
[23:29:31] <impliednude> yeah
[23:29:39] <impliednude> one thing at a time ^_^
