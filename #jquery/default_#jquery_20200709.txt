[00:10:56] <jak2000> checking
[00:11:27] <jak2000> try change but not was fired...
[00:11:49] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[00:12:55] <jak2000> creating fiddle
[00:15:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/kef9nvux/
[00:15:26] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[00:15:30] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple test case :)
[00:17:37] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/dr5m847o/
[00:17:54] <robertmaxrees> ...
[00:18:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:18:33] <robertmaxrees> so where's the change handler you tried?
[00:19:28] <jak2000> oo yes
[00:19:45] <robertmaxrees> also: it's not multiple="multiple" - just need "multiple" there.
[00:25:26] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/ta6zsej5/2/   test please
[00:25:37] <jak2000> 2 things 1) how to get the selected txt option?
[00:25:40] <jak2000> (not the value)
[00:25:49] <jak2000> and how to separate by ","
[00:26:08] <robertmaxrees> it's an array.
[00:26:17] <robertmaxrees> .val() is an array of values.
[00:26:25] <robertmaxrees> what do you want to do with each one?
[00:27:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean the most recently selected value?
[00:27:25] <jak2000> 1 separete with comas
[00:27:32] <jak2000> and 2) get the text values selected
[00:28:06] <robertmaxrees> use .join(',') on the array.
[00:29:48] <jak2000> ok, done
[00:29:53] <robertmaxrees> working?
[00:29:54] <jak2000> and how to get the textvalue?
[00:29:55] <jak2000> yes
[00:30:03] <jak2000> xvalues.join(',')
[00:30:08] <robertmaxrees> Why do you need the "textvalue"?
[00:30:18] <jak2000> only for user
[00:30:21] <jak2000> purposes..
[00:30:29] <jak2000> the user see the values selected...
[00:30:45] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/xM8xOzt.png
[00:30:46] <robertmaxrees> done
[00:31:33] <jak2000> yes, how to translate this values selected: 88, 113, 198   to a div?
[00:32:06] <robertmaxrees> so you can repeat information the user already has? lol you can grab the selected nodes using .find(':selected') on the select element.
[00:34:22] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[00:34:24] <jak2000> worked
[00:34:36] <robertmaxrees> might rethink your approach here fwiw.
[00:45:37] <nanthencodeneeth> i wrote a small script .Here it is .How to get the value after the $getjson has executed .Here is my doubt.I am new to javascript.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62806992/value-inside-function-call-not-getting-reflected-outsid...
[00:46:13] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneethq because getJSON is an asynchronous function.  anything that relies on that value needs to be in that callback.
[00:47:05] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees can you please some more tips . Idod nt fully understand it
[00:47:23] <nanthencodeneeth> what does value need to be in callback mean
[00:47:36] <robertmaxrees> nanthencodeneeth sure - see where you have that " price=data[key].price;" stuff?  you need to put any other code in there.
[00:48:00] <robertmaxrees> you can't rely on the value existing outside of there because that's how async stuff works.
[00:49:35] <nanthencodeneeth> ok how to get the value after the value has been got
[00:49:45] <nanthencodeneeth> i am really new to this concept
[00:49:45] <robertmaxrees> in that callback :)
[00:49:55] <robertmaxrees> you can't rely on it outside.
[00:50:07] <robertmaxrees> if you're still having issues, share more code to explain your actual issue.
[00:50:20] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise I'm just going to keep saying "your code needs to be in the callback".
[00:54:46] <nanthencodeneeth> https://pastebin.com/raw/TteDLWF5 robertmaxrees
[00:54:56] <nanthencodeneeth> here is my full code
[00:55:39] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so where *specifically* are you having issues?
[00:55:58] <nanthencodeneeth> can you please help me by guiding how to <input type="hidden" name="price'+i+'">'+printprice+'Rs</input> is printing as 0
[00:56:24] <nanthencodeneeth> i am geting it as json which is 5
[00:56:47] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're trying to append all those prices from the getJson call??
[00:56:56] <nanthencodeneeth> yes
[00:57:08] <nanthencodeneeth> but 0 is getting appended
[00:57:13] <nanthencodeneeth> i want json value
[00:58:08] <robertmaxrees> you just need to put it all in that callback.
[00:58:30] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/QR4A
[00:59:06] <robertmaxrees> (that's just the change function btw)
[01:02:18] <nanthencodeneeth> no it s not working robertmaxrees
[01:02:31] <robertmaxrees> any Js errors or anything?
[01:02:38] <nanthencodeneeth> no error
[01:02:50] <nanthencodeneeth> but value is showing as 0
[01:03:01] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything here :)
[01:03:11] <robertmaxrees> let's reduce this down to something simpler.
[01:03:41] <nanthencodeneeth> ok
[01:04:06] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[01:04:11] <robertmaxrees> var nosvalue = $(this).val();
[01:04:13] <nanthencodeneeth> ok
[01:04:23] <robertmaxrees> move that to the top of the change callback.
[01:04:32] <robertmaxrees> after nameofselectedsublist
[01:04:56] <robertmaxrees> also: what is "$.each(data, function(key, val) {" doing?
[01:05:17] <robertmaxrees> or is it just printPrice you're trying to get?
[01:06:03] <robertmaxrees> like, is console.log("Print price........" + printprice); correct?
[01:06:26] <nanthencodeneeth> yes
[01:07:03] <robertmaxrees> try https://bpa.st/6UWQ
[01:07:09] <robertmaxrees> moved that $(this).val() call.
[01:08:44] <robertmaxrees> if you're still having issues, show me your latest code.
[01:12:57] <nanthencodeneeth> robertmaxrees now it is working thank you so much you are great
[01:13:08] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that did?
[01:13:15] <robertmaxrees> why didn't you do that when I first suggested it? lol
[03:37:42] <nanthencodeneeth> I have posted a doubt regarding jquery and php.Can i ask it here .If this is wrong place please ignore https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62809521/date-passed-from-input-type-date-seems-to-be-empty-and-outputs-1970-01-01

[15:12:10] <forgotmynick> hi. when doing .post, how does jquery know if it's a fail? is it from any response that isn't 200?
[15:12:49] <robertmaxrees> there are a few response codes that can cause it to be rejected, as well as an issue with the format of the data vs, say, you dataType config option.
[15:14:46] <robertmaxrees> forgotmynick
[15:17:17] <forgotmynick> robertmaxrees: thanks. but lets say its json, how should i structure the response to contain the necessary information? the documentation is a puzzle https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[15:17:30] <robertmaxrees> it just needs to be valid JSON.
[15:17:43] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing your code?
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> forg
[15:21:42] <robertmaxrees> * forgotmynick
[15:26:56] <morenoh11> can you have more than one jquery-ui progressbar on a page? are there any pitfalls trying to make two dom elements a progressbar?
[15:34:45] <robertmaxrees> what do the docs say?
[15:36:48] <morenoh11> robertmaxrees: docs say nothing regarding conflicting progressbars on a single page
[15:37:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:37:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g9dz081w/ morenoh11 :)
[15:40:44] <morenoh11> I had the wrong selector, thanks
[15:40:53] <robertmaxrees> ah, gotcha.
