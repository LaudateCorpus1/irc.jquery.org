[01:18:50] <Fritx> hi, I have a form with multiple selects, some of the options have a certain data attribute. is it possible to get the values of that data attribute for the currently selected options ???

[04:05:00] <AdamPDotty> #css
[04:16:52] <hellyeah> styling in js and styling in css really matter on how browser behaves?
[04:19:15] <slax0r> yes, and you get a performance impact
[04:20:18] <hellyeah> positive, negative?
[04:24:19] <slax0r> hellyeah: what do you think? instead of just giving the browser a css file, and telling it, here, parse and apply these styles, you are now giving it a javascript file, telling it, here, parse and execute this file, where it then applies css rules to the dom, and then has to apply sthe affected styles
[04:39:01] <hellyeah> slax0r:  it is really neat
[04:39:06] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:39:26] <hellyeah> this execution steps seems load browser's memory
[04:39:35] <hellyeah> which is not good to load it with css
[04:44:19] <jomofcw> Hello !
[04:44:45] <jomofcw> Is there a callback AJAX for "after content replace" ? When using load() method for example.
[04:45:46] <hellyeah> you mean doing something after success callback happen?
[04:48:41] <jomofcw> hellyeah hello ! Yup kinda, but I would be sure that will happen after the content has been inserted. What I'm doing : using jQuery colorbox and jQuery form (from malsup) I want to resize the colorbox, after the AJAX form has been updated.
[04:49:18] <jomofcw> In fact after few test, it seems that the success callboack of jQuery form do the trick.
[04:50:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:50:27] <hellyeah> well if i understand you correctly
[04:50:33] <hellyeah> ajjax will be done
[04:50:42] <hellyeah> after it finish success will be executed
[04:50:50] <hellyeah> success may work for you
[04:50:53] <hellyeah> i am sorry gotta launch
[04:53:23] <jomofcw> hellyeah ok thanks ;).
[06:06:04] <PCatinean> hey guys
[06:14:29] <PCatinean> I have this block of code: http://hastebin.com/yifepotaxi.coffee
[06:14:40] <matthewbe> hi
[06:14:56] <PCatinean> Can one tell me how I can make it raise a error by raising it in onload function?
[06:15:03] <PCatinean> I tried throw and all that it did not seem to hit
[06:15:52] <matthewbe> in my interface, i have a lot of animation as hide('slow'), show('slow'). I have a list of folders and you can expand recursively all its subfolders etc. At one point, if I interact heavily with the application, hide() and show() don't work properly anymore...
[06:16:53] <matthewbe> for example, after calling hide(), the element is still display:block, but it adds styles like overflow hidden height, width, padding, ...
[06:17:03] <matthewbe> like it's going to start an animation, but freezes
[07:45:58] <matthewbe> hah closed my chrome, re-opened, and now everything works normal :-/
[08:19:48] <marahin> Hello. Is there a way to send blob alongside with some parameters through AJAX?
[08:20:05] <marahin> Honestly, a BLOB and a string.
[08:20:11] <marahin> What's the easiest way to achieve that for a newbie?
[08:24:07] <Arobot> How do you return value from jquery functions?
[08:26:10] <hellyeah> Arobot:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/gwma45ca/
[08:26:28] <hellyeah> with return keyword
[08:26:46] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/gwma45ca/1/
[08:28:18] <hellyeah> Arobot:  what are you trying to do actually?
[08:28:42] <Arobot> http://codepen.io/KungFuPandemonium/pen/vKVdjR?editors=1111
[08:29:03] <Arobot> Store jquery function inside a variable
[08:29:16] <Arobot> but it stores juqery object instead
[08:32:17] <hellyeah> Arobot:  a is NaN
[08:33:05] <hellyeah> ah sorry
[08:33:10] <hellyeah> when you click the day
[08:33:11] <Arobot> look at console
[08:33:13] <hellyeah> you get the number
[08:33:13] <Arobot> yeah
[08:33:24] <hellyeah> isnt that what you meant?
[08:33:50] <hellyeah> what is cons?
[08:34:14] <hellyeah> do you want to get day number?
[08:34:18] <Arobot> yeah
[08:34:30] <Arobot> just to an execution context that is outside
[08:34:39] <Arobot> of that juqery function
[08:34:54] <Arobot> storing jquery statements just shows the jquery object
[08:35:18] <Arobot> its not like native JS when you can just var val = myFunction()
[08:37:07] <hellyeah> what is "cons"
[08:37:08] <hellyeah> ?
[08:37:47] <Arobot> where do you see cons?
[08:37:58] <hellyeah> there is error on console
[08:38:11] <hellyeah> pen.js:149 Uncaught ReferenceError: cons is not defined
[08:41:56] <Arobot> what is pen.js? I have only 9 lines of code in my codepen
[08:42:00] <Arobot> I cant see this error
[09:03:32] <AwkwardCough> cons sounds like a variable that was never created but is trying to get used
[09:11:02] <taplar> what did it do time for?
[09:11:44] <taplar> hellyeah: you around bro?
[09:19:44] <BenMerkley> http://pastebin.com/dWQp8QYc
[09:20:33] <BenMerkley> Having an issue where i want a fction to run on focus and on click, for tabbign to it it has caused issues when i tried was wondering if anyone could lend a hand
[09:22:05] <taplar> so right now you doing stuff on click, but you want the same thing on focus and blur?
[09:22:38] <BenMerkley> I want it to run when tabbed to and run when clicked,
[09:22:52] <taplar> so 'click focus'
[09:22:56] <BenMerkley> it is a search popup so when  you click the icon it opens and closes
[09:23:30] <taplar> or just 'focus', if click gives it focus it would still fire
[09:23:30] <BenMerkley> yeah i tried that but becuase the element was focused when it was clicked again it would run
[09:24:34] <BenMerkley> but i cant click it again to close it
[09:24:41] <BenMerkley> cause it is technically still focused
[09:24:44] <taplar> so 'focus blur'
[09:25:03] <taplar> oh but you want to be able to close it on click
[09:25:15] <BenMerkley> yeah
[09:26:28] <BenMerkley> nvm! got it
[09:26:43] <BenMerkley> with some this.blur() to remove the focus from the element
[09:33:37] <hellyeah> taplar:
[09:33:49] <hellyeah> i am sorry i wasnt in front of computer
[09:33:53] <hellyeah> i am here right now
[09:34:12] <taplar> yo, i put a link in here yesterday a little before i left work.  if you check the logs you should be able to find it
[09:34:29] <hellyeah> <AwkwardCough> cons sounds like a variable that was never created but is trying to get used how is that possible?
[09:34:48] <hellyeah> let me check taplar thank you so much. i appreciated
[09:39:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
[09:39:39] <hellyeah> is this the one right?
[09:40:23] <taplar> looks right
[09:41:12] <hellyeah> hmm so i need to use bootstrap datepicker instead of jquery ui datepicker. Thats nice to know but it is little tricky adopt it :D
[09:42:19] <hellyeah> ah
[09:42:21] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:42:23] <hellyeah> may be i am wrong
[09:42:46] <hellyeah> may be it is just enough to ref that file and i have that functionality
[09:43:09] <hellyeah> usage is the same with jquery ui datepicker $('.datepicker').datepicker()
[09:43:39] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[09:49:18] <taplar> try it and see
[09:55:45] <hellyeah> taplar:
[09:56:00] <hellyeah> yeah i will try that i will report you abour result
[09:56:38] <taplar> no need to report.  if it works for you, cool
[09:57:48] <hellyeah> oeky :D
[11:13:59] <Duikb00t-home> o/

[11:53:33] <Paradisee> hello
[11:53:51] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0W6E02D
[11:53:57] <Paradisee> why doesn't it print nothing on the console?
[11:54:05] <Paradisee> but i get a correct 200
[11:54:19] <robertmaxrees> the data format may be bad.
[11:54:27] <Paradisee> it might be. ty
[11:58:54] <Paradisee> doesn't seem to be the problem
[11:59:02] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing a copy of the data?
[11:59:16] <robertmaxrees> or did you find the issue?
[12:00:06] <Paradisee> i did not.
[12:00:17] <robertmaxrees> then could you share a copy of the data coming back?
[12:00:21] <Paradisee> it's a python module, will you understand it?
[12:00:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:00:34] <robertmaxrees> i want the data coming back, not your server-side code.
[12:00:35] <Paradisee> i create the json from python
[12:00:51] <robertmaxrees> right - i don't want the pythong, i want the json :)
[12:00:56] <Paradisee> wait
[12:00:57] <robertmaxrees> s/pythong/python
[12:00:58] <b-ot> Correction, <robertmaxrees> right - i don't want the python, i want the json :)
[12:01:18] <taplar> take the json returned on the request (from the network tab) and stick it in here: https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
[12:01:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:18:50] <StephenS> when I use jquery and I remove options from select dropdown, the last item is removed, however its still in the select dropdown field, and it disappears once I hover that field, any ideas?
[12:19:15] <Paradisee> the json looks fine.
[12:19:18] <Paradisee> what else could be the problem?
[12:19:48] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee so the JSON validates?  could be that weird chrome cache bug.  have you tried using .fail() and seeing if something is failing?
[12:20:13] <Paradisee> gonna try
[12:21:46] <StephenS> any idea?
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> StephenS i'd have to see it.
[12:22:08] <Paradisee> doesn't print nothing...
[12:22:23] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee then it might be that caching bug.
[12:22:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i have no idea without seeing it.
[12:22:41] <Paradisee> on firefox?
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee are you on firefox or chrome?
[12:22:56] <Paradisee> ff
[12:23:00] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:23:17] <robertmaxrees> then not the caching bug.  and you're SURE you're passing back valid json?
[12:23:22] <robertmaxrees> like, you validated it and everything?
[12:23:32] <robertmaxrees> not by hand but by using a validator.
[12:23:33] <StephenS> eh I fixed it
[12:23:39] <robertmaxrees> StephenS what'd you do?
[12:23:42] <StephenS> but not by jQuery coding standards
[12:24:07] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/h94kAM8m that
[12:24:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused by the problem you're solving, but ok.
[12:24:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:33:44] <arc_> hm i wish i had thought of this before but i guess it doesn't matter if an element is visible or not when you're using .click()
[12:33:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:34:26] <arc_> i was trying to figure out a non-hacky way to click on a dropdown menu button, thinking i had to actually activate the menu first
[12:34:45] <robertmaxrees> why not abstract out the function for it and call that instead?
[12:34:51] <arc_> userscript ;D
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[12:35:05] <arc_> that's like 99% of what i use javascript/jquery for
[12:35:24] <arc_> i like making websites work how i want them to
[12:35:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:38:39] <Uhkis> i prefer replacing such sites
[12:38:43] <arc_> :p
[12:38:50] <arc_> frequently that is not an option
[12:39:18] <robertmaxrees> arc_ what sorts of issues are you fixing?
[12:39:53] <arc_> at the moment i'm just adding keyboard shortcuts to the quickbooks web app for a friend of mine
[12:40:18] <robertmaxrees> have you ever thought to reach out to these places with your ideas?
[12:40:20] <taplar> quickbooks!  not quick enough!
[12:41:00] <arc_> i have asked for features to be added a few times. usually doesn't work. plus it takes way less time to just do it myself than to wait for a response
[12:41:19] <robertmaxrees> where did I say you couldn't also implement them yourself? :)
[12:41:32] <arc_> didn't, just saying
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> :) i'd do both.
[12:42:15] <z1haze_work> how do i fix an issue with a .hover() function where an event is firing a every tiem the mouse moves while its hover, but it should only fire the when its hovered, 1 time
[12:42:27] <z1haze_work> do i need to change to .on('mouseenter' ?
[12:42:39] <arc_> sounds about right
[12:42:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work https://api.jquery.com/hover/
[12:42:57] <robertmaxrees> "The .hover() method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events. You can use it to simply apply behavior to an element during the time the mouse is within the element."
[12:43:08] <robertmaxrees> z1haze sounds like maybe you need to change where you're binding.
[12:43:21] <z1haze_work> hmm
[12:43:43] <z1haze_work> then it shouldnt be firing multiple times then
[12:43:59] <robertmaxrees> which is why i said it sounds like you need to change where you're binding :)
[12:44:43] <z1haze_work> why if i dont need do an anything on mouseout
[12:44:46] <z1haze_work> what*
[12:44:57] <robertmaxrees> then nothing will ever happen on mouseout?
[12:45:18] <z1haze_work> i have some crazy stuff going on in my staging server that isnt able to be replicated in my sandbox server, so i cant show whats happening unfortunately
[12:45:33] <robertmaxrees> what's the "crazy stuff"?
[12:46:12] <robertmaxrees> also: you're aware .hover() binds a listener for mouseenter and mouseleave, right?
[13:00:05] <taplar> crazy stuff.  three ladies
[13:00:23] <taplar> what am i saying...
[13:00:25] <taplar> one lady
[13:37:22] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3HDT2SZ
[13:37:26] <Paradisee> what's wrong with my code?
[13:37:37] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:37:37] <Paradisee> why am i not able to create markers on the google map?
[13:37:49] <robertmaxrees> is the getJSON call not logging anything?
[13:38:17] <Paradisee> it doesn't print nothing on the console. but i see the calls
[13:38:24] <robertmaxrees> then there's your problem.
[13:38:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix that getJSON call.
[13:38:38] <Paradisee> i don't get how.
[13:39:45] <Paradisee> on chrome it prints the objects
[13:40:18] <Paradisee> Object {lat: "10", lng: "20"}
[13:40:55] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/4171e45efdc1
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you use this instead of the getJSON call?
[13:42:54] <Paradisee> InvalidValueError: initialize is not a function
[13:43:09] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?>
[13:43:33] <Paradisee> my bad
[13:43:42] <Paradisee> btw doesnt show nothing
[13:43:54] <Paradisee> on chrome it show it worked
[13:44:01] <taplar> 'anything'
[13:44:14] <robertmaxrees> you've got something really really strange going on then.  any errors or anything like that?
[13:44:28] <Paradisee> but on chrome i can print whatever i want
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> cross-browser issues with jquery are rare.
[13:44:40] <Paradisee> but i still dont get these marks on the map
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a big part of what it does.
[13:44:47] <robertmaxrees> your json call is failing.
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> so we need to figure out what the problem is there.
[13:44:55] <Paradisee> why you say that
[13:44:57] <robertmaxrees> that will fix everything else for you.
[13:45:12] <Paradisee> if i put an alert i see the object in both browsers
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> if https://bpaste.net/show/4171e45efdc1 doesn't show anything in your console, then something is really broken.
[13:45:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:45:51] <robertmaxrees> so if you use alert it work in FF?
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> but console.log doesn't?
[13:46:03] <Paradisee> ya
[13:46:06] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> that means you're filtering logs out of the ff console
[13:46:18] <taplar> lol
[13:46:23] <Paradisee> im not.
[13:46:24] <taplar> nyce
[13:46:29] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:46:36] <robertmaxrees> then you're looking at the wrong console.
[13:46:37] <Paradisee> i already checked that before
[13:46:44] <Paradisee> lol.
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> make sure everything under "js" and "logging" are enabled in the dev tools.
[13:47:18] <Paradisee> they are.
[13:47:23] <Paradisee> https://www.livecoding.tv/paradisee89/
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> then something is way broken.
[13:47:32] <robertmaxrees> heh, no thanks ;)
[13:48:42] <arc_> if it comes up in the log in chrome and not in firefox, the problem is almost definitely not the code
[13:48:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:48:58] <Paradisee> we're agree with that
[13:49:49] <robertmaxrees> when's the last time you restarted FF?  i've have both it and chrome wig out sometimes and all i needed was to close all instances of it and make sure the process died.
[13:49:58] <Paradisee> dunno
[13:50:03] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:50:18] <Paradisee> not going to restart it right now.
[13:50:34] <Paradisee> and i don't really care if it doesn't print.
[13:50:45] <Paradisee> i just wanna make sure these markers shows ff on the map
[13:50:46] <robertmaxrees> except that's how you're going to debug this.
[13:50:56] <taplar> or debugger;
[13:51:19] <robertmaxrees> sure, but the console may or may not work, so you can't log out evaluations while debugging.
[13:51:33] <Paradisee> i can still use alert
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> alerts are bad for debugging.
[13:51:42] <Paradisee> or even chrom
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> they change program flow.
[13:51:55] <robertmaxrees> and how do you plan to use chrome to debug a problem with firefox?
[13:52:20] <Paradisee> as i said, "i'm not going to restart ff right now"
[13:52:28] <Paradisee> i'll do it later on
[13:52:31] <Paradisee> once i've done
[13:52:33] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) lol
[13:52:36] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[13:52:50] <Paradisee> too many shit opened
[13:53:18] <taplar> you can make firefox remember the last tabs open, fwiw
[13:53:35] <Paradisee> got 3 ff opened
[13:53:43] <Paradisee> with at least 50+ tabs
[13:53:47] <Paradisee> per each ff
[13:54:02] <robertmaxrees> I'm interested to see how you're planning on debugging one browser by using another.
[13:54:37] <Paradisee> it is not my work.
[13:54:42] <Paradisee> i work on the backend
[13:54:57] <robertmaxrees> then why ask why it's not working in ff in the first place?
[13:55:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm so lost hahahahaha
[13:55:23] <Paradisee> we were looking at theproblem and we figured out that was ff
[13:55:29] <Paradisee> i don't see any problem :)
[13:55:40] <Paradisee> just restart it and should work again (i hope)
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> the console should, yeah.
[13:55:49] <Paradisee> but i can't do it, right now.
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> that may or may not fix the actual underlying bug (shrug)
[13:56:07] <Paradisee> ifc,
[13:56:08] <Paradisee> ofc.
[13:56:21] <Paradisee> but i don't think it will fix it
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:56:46] <taplar> i'm still blown away by 150 tabs
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> 150+ tabs even
[13:57:00] <taplar> it's like tab hoarding
[13:57:11] <Paradisee> i should use bookmarks
[13:57:16] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[13:57:16] <Paradisee> but are annoying
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[13:57:45] <Paradisee> dunno, i prefer to have each tab opened instead
[13:58:05] <robertmaxrees> why?  is it the "go to open page" thing?
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> becuase it'll pull from your bookmarks the same way.
[13:58:44] <taplar> if you label them descriptively, you can search for them in your url...
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:59:20] <taplar> i got the jquery logs and my irc client done like that, all i have to type is 'irc' in the url and i can choose from the two
[13:59:25] <arc_> if i have more than like 25 tabs open, it gives me anxiety
[14:00:03] <Paradisee> ya but i just hate doin that
[14:00:07] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:00:16] <robertmaxrees> you're entire machine will run faster.
[14:00:20] <Paradisee> i dunno, i always did in this way
[14:00:28] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet FF hasn't updated in a while, either.
[14:00:31] <Paradisee> it's fast enough anyway
[14:01:01] <taplar> how often do you go through to see if any of the tabs are duplicates?
[14:01:16] <Paradisee> i don't have duplicated tabs
[14:01:36] <arc_> but you don't check
[14:01:41] <Paradisee> cus i know.
[14:01:48] <arc_> if you say so
[14:01:50] <robertmaxrees> you're holding state on over 150 tabs?
[14:01:53] <robertmaxrees> in your head?
[14:01:56] <Paradisee> absolutely
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> i call nonsense on that.
[14:02:20] <arc_> somebody needs to listen to the you are not so smart podcast, tagline 'a celebration of self-delusion'
[14:02:20] <taplar> tab 67, what is it? go!
[14:02:57] <taplar> ooooooh, non-immediate response
[14:03:03] <taplar> *tsk tsk tsk*
[14:03:09] <Paradisee> i don't know the number of each tab
[14:03:16] <Paradisee> i just remember the position
[14:03:27] <taplar> luv it
[14:03:30] <robertmaxrees> i shudder to think what your swap looks like.
[14:04:04] <taplar> this makes me think of the ending of the 'the server is down' video
[14:04:14] <arc_> you mean the website is down?
[14:04:18] <taplar> sorry, ya
[14:04:24] <arc_> that series is amazing
[15:53:34] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[16:00:03] <mcfdez> Hello. Anyone can help me to console log this fiddle please? https://jsfiddle.net/vskuehwh/1/
[16:00:21] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:00:43] <robertmaxrees> so columnClicks is declared as an array, but you then do columnClicks['customers'] = []
[16:00:51] <robertmaxrees> which means you're adding normal properties to that object.
[16:01:00] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want it to behave like an associative array, yeah?>
[16:03:09] <mcfdez> robertmaxrees, yes
[16:03:19] <robertmaxrees> those don't exist in JavaScript :)
[16:04:26] <robertmaxrees> so sadly you cannot do what you're looking to do.
[16:05:24] <taplar> just go with an object, and if/when you want to loop over all the keys in order, you can loop on Object.keys() or something else
[16:05:39] <taplar> though 'in order' might be weird
[16:05:40] <robertmaxrees> "loop over all the keys in order" - except you can't guarantee an order.
[16:05:57] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to do lots of enumeration, just use an array.
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> or even a little.  you can .filter() or whatever for the data you want.
[16:07:54] <yosi> I have a simple queary. I want to have a blog section on my site but I dont want to have 400 pages of blog posts. I am not using any MVC framework, can I do it in jquery alone or do I have to use some sort of mvc?
[16:08:10] <robertmaxrees> yosi you have to have a backend of some kind.
[16:08:22] <robertmaxrees> doesn't have to be MVC, but it does need to be on a server.
[16:09:19] <yosi> Maybe its just too complex for me right now, I am just using simple $.post() calls to get some example info from a json file but I cant use that for actual markup and such can I?
[16:09:34] <robertmaxrees> err, you can, but that's a really convoluted way to do it.
[16:09:42] <taplar> how are you managing that json file?
[16:09:45] <yosi> I mean the character strings get way too long
[16:10:24] <robertmaxrees> "way too long" meaning...?
[16:10:31] <robertmaxrees> how much data are you shipping around?
[16:11:07] <yosi> I thought there was some limit to how ling a json string could be?
[16:11:30] <robertmaxrees> not imposed by the language.
[16:11:42] <yosi> like I cant hold a whole blog post in one blog.post[0].entry or whatever can i?
[16:11:50] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[16:11:53] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[16:11:55] <robertmaxrees> but you could.
[16:11:56] <yosi> well poop
[16:12:02] <yosi> maybe I can do trhis then
[16:12:16] <yosi> what would be a better way?
[16:12:20] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use jquery for it though.
[16:12:28] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to use jquery for this?
[16:12:34] <taplar> store your blog posts in a database
[16:12:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:12:47] <taplar> get them a subset at a time, or each by reference
[16:12:52] <yosi> just to practice / improve my javascripting
[16:13:13] <robertmaxrees> so my number one biggest suggestion there is "build good stuff - practice good habits"
[16:13:26] <yosi> I will transform it into a mean app eventually but im nubly
[16:13:29] <robertmaxrees> in this case, if you really want to do it client-side, check out a js templating engine.
[16:13:43] <yosi> its just on github.io for now I didnt think I could use a db?
[16:13:48] <robertmaxrees> ah, nope.
[16:13:54] <robertmaxrees> being good with javascript is as much about knowing when to NOT use it.
[16:14:00] <robertmaxrees> then you want a client-side templating engine.
[16:14:01] <yosi> lol
[16:14:03] <yosi> true
[16:14:33] <yosi> jade \ hogan or something?
[16:14:39] <robertmaxrees> or dust.
[16:14:45] <robertmaxrees> or underscore.
[16:14:51] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use jade.
[16:15:41] <yosi> im just getting back into the web thing, I took a hiatus due to vision loss but now I have some adaptive stuff and am taking classes
[16:15:48] <robertmaxrees> awesome!
[16:16:24] <yosi> so I know a few things but somethings im totally lost on lol
[16:16:41] <yosi> dust looks amazing!
[16:17:03] <robertmaxrees> we use it where i work.  i like it quite a bit.
[16:18:15] <yosi> can I use this without a db?
[16:18:44] <robertmaxrees> it's just a javascript templating engine.
[16:18:44] <robertmaxrees> so yeah.
[16:19:57] <yosi> works for my current needs!
[16:20:30] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[16:58:02] <sp1rs> anyone familiar with service worker ?
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> lots of people are.
[17:00:35] <robertmaxrees> sp1rs if you have a question, go ahead and just ask.
[17:00:42] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will :)
[17:01:17] <sp1rs> working on service worker push notification on desktop, the problem is when i maximized the chrome browser i am not able to see the notification, but when i dont maximized it worked any idea why ?
[17:02:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[17:03:17] <taplar> you got some sort of media queries going on that aren't accounting for the large size?
[17:03:43] <robertmaxrees> push notifications aren't in the window last i checked.
[17:04:00] <taplar> ah
[17:04:21] <robertmaxrees> could have that wrong though.
[17:06:09] <sp1rs> robertmaxrees: i am on mac
[17:06:21] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:52:46] <fructose> I'm trying to fix a site that retrieves and replaces parts of a page instead of the whole thing, which is causing issues when asynchronous calls end up coming back for parts of a page that have already been replaced. Does anyone know a way to fix this globally (as opposed to modifying each case to account for this possibility)?
[17:54:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:54:24] <neilpdx> my first thought is to use a global variable to store the "state" of each part, but, I know that globals are deprecated
[17:54:38] <robertmaxrees> globals aren't deprecated, but that's a hack to handle the problem.
[17:54:54] <neilpdx> ok thank you for sharing that with me as I am still learning javascript
[17:55:11] <robertmaxrees> you should avoid globals as much as possible, fwiw.
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> fructose When you say "when asynchronous calls end up coming back for parts of a page that have already been replaced", do you mean you have mutliple ajax calls running at the same time?
[17:55:30] <neilpdx> yes you helped me troubleshoot a problem with my jquery that was caused by using globals
[17:55:34] <robertmaxrees> trying to understand waht issue you're having?
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun.
[17:58:37] <fructose> robertmaxrees: To give an example, you load the Basic Dashboard page, which in turn starts retrieving the widgets on that page via AJAX. But before they are done loading, you click the Advanced Dashboard button, which is the same page, but with different widgets. However, requests for the Basic Dashboard are still coming back and running, when they should be ignored/cancelled
[17:59:05] <robertmaxrees> that means you want to cancel the original ajax call.
[17:59:17] <robertmaxrees> though normally you'd prevent input in those cases, depending on how long they run.
[18:00:08] <fructose> robertmaxrees: Is there a "cancel unwanted AJAX calls" functionality in jQuery you're referring to?
[18:00:50] <robertmaxrees> you can cancel active ajax requests.
[18:01:13] <robertmaxrees> but that's not built-in to jquery.
[18:01:14] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446594/abort-ajax-requests-using-jquery
[18:02:08] <fructose> Right, but that's not a global solution. You'd have to track and abort each one.
[18:02:17] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to store them, yes.
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> there's no global solution, really.
[18:02:47] <robertmaxrees> not without storing a reference to all those requests.
[18:03:10] <taplar> on average how long does it take for them all to finish?
[18:05:23] <fructose> Well, it looks like $.active keeps track of the number of requests. There really isn't anything that will actually list them?
[18:06:30] <robertmaxrees> $.active is an internal variable that they use for their own purposes.  also it's $.ajax.active iirc.
[18:07:24] <robertmaxrees> and jquery's not going to store references to all pending ajax requests.  you could extend $.ajax() yourself to do it, but i'd really encourage rethinking your setup to work around this.
[18:09:18] <fructose> I already tried encouraging that, but unfortunately this isn't my project
[18:09:53] <fructose> Well, at this point, that is fortunate I suppose
[18:10:03] <robertmaxrees> strange that they won't let you take any ownership and try to fix it if they're having you work on it.
[18:10:08] <robertmaxrees> strange way to run a project.
[18:11:19] <fructose> Not big on admitting they're bad at what they do... human nature I guess
[18:11:41] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say it's bad or good.  just different requirements now.
[18:11:42] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[18:11:45] <fructose> Dunning-Kruger effect it's called, right
[18:11:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:11:57] <robertmaxrees> dunning-kruger is a different concept.
[18:12:41] <fructose> Thought it was the one where untalented individuals rate themselves highly when in fact they below average or worse
[18:13:02] <robertmaxrees> that's when your relative lack of skill in a field is such that you have no idea how good or bad you are.  we're protective over our ego so we default to thinking we're great.
[18:13:19] <robertmaxrees> and i was more saying that their decisions weren't necessarily bad the first time around :)
[18:13:28] <fructose> Oh, they were bad
[18:13:49] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  either way, there's really no internal state that jquery holds on all pending ajax requests.
[18:14:03] <taplar> on average how long does it take for them all to finish?
[18:14:09] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah hahaha.  that question.
[18:17:46] * taplar taps the mic
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> fructose ^
[18:22:52] <taplar> guess it's not important
[18:26:22] <neilpdx> i'm not ready to start working with AJAX in my project yet, but, do any of you use AJAX with the Python Django web framework?  Have you had success?
[18:26:32] <robertmaxrees> lots of people have.
[18:27:05] <taplar> what's the concern?
[18:31:05] <taplar> i'm going to have to start attaching then() to my questions
[18:31:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:32:44] <taplar> gah!  i missed a joke
[18:33:07] <taplar> i could have been like.  "sure, though some people have ran into errors or always's"
[18:34:20] <robertmaxrees> but then what would you have said?
[18:34:24] <robertmaxrees> boom
[18:34:35] <robertmaxrees> i've resolved to make more puns.
[18:34:39] <taplar> ^_^
[18:35:12] <taplar> insanity is a state of mind.  HAPPINESS... i mean happiness
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> helluva typo
[18:36:23] <taplar> hellyeah
[19:15:07] <taplar> i was telling AwkwardCough today that I think it would be funny if, if you ever get into the situation where your upset with someone to the point were you say "Your Dead To Me!"
[19:15:26] <taplar> as soon as they start talking after that statement, you should jump back surprised and yell "ZOMBIE!"
[19:50:12] <neilpdx> :)
[23:54:37] <arif__> Does anyone know what event is fired when the controls in blueimp gallery are shown?
[23:54:49] <arif__> I went through the docs but couldn't find it
