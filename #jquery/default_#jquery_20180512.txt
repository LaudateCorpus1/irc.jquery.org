[16:26:54] <BCB> how do I update css on success of an ajax call
[16:42:16] <BCB> need a little help with dynamic updating of client-side CSS
[17:05:04] <webdude_> BCB, you define a function for the success on the ajax call and then just use the regular .css() to update it in that function
[17:06:17] <BCB> webdude_: thanks.  I just figured out that success: didn't seem to work with out a subsequent error: call.
[17:06:21] <BCB> let me try that
[18:13:03] <SideFX> I have a class that when clicked on makes an ajax call, I want the .done(function()) to change the color of the class that was clicked
[18:13:28] <SideFX> The $(this) doesn't seem to be attached the the class
[18:29:12] <pavonia> SideFX: That's a bit confusing. You cannot click on classes, only on elements that have classes. So you'd have to check the class for the clicked element in your handler
[18:33:33] <SideFX> I figured it out, I had the $(this) inside the success: and not inside the parent function

[23:19:01] <ryan_ford> unless your asking about css positioning, which this isn't really the place for those kinds of questions
