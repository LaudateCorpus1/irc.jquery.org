[04:33:07] <Encrypt> Hello everybody
[04:33:38] <Encrypt> I am working on a project with Semantic UI
[04:34:43] <Encrypt> I have created a form and I would like to give the possibility to users to add a new field in a form
[04:35:39] <Encrypt> For instance, imagine the case of a contact form, that would be "add phone number"
[04:36:12] <Encrypt> I have not managed to find how to do it with Semantic UI
[04:36:34] <Encrypt> How should I do it?
[04:37:14] <Cork> Encrypt: https://gitter.im/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI
[04:39:56] <Encrypt> Thanks Cork
[05:21:56] <Blinky_> Hi all wondering if someone could help.  I am trying to get a tool tip to show the html formatting that is conatined in a string, placed into a li using jquery - this is the example, as you can see when hovering the html is displayed not processed, any ideas? - http://jsbin.com/hagaduyomo/edit?html,output
[05:23:59] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/ua7gwxao/
[05:24:04] <Cork> you need to wait for the dom to load
[05:24:39] <Cork> Blinky_: that said i would recommend using a <script type="text/template"></script> instead it becomes much cleaner
[05:25:27] <Blinky_> Cork, sorry mate I am a little confused, I get the tooltip but I can see the <b> in the text.  If I place the html into the tooltip outside of the jquery the I have a bold word and not <b>
[05:27:06] <Cork> ah, missunderstood what you asked for
[05:27:15] <Cork> Blinky_: the default tooltip supports text only
[05:27:25] <Cork> you would have to use a js replacement to show html
[05:27:53] <Cork> Blinky_: about the template anyway https://jsfiddle.net/ua7gwxao/1/
[05:28:00] <Blinky_> The foundation one does support html as I am currently using it on the same page, it is just when I place the li in using jquery the html formatting fails.
[05:29:04] <Cork> Blinky_: how are you adding the tooltime with the fundation then?
[05:29:07] <Cork> cause it doesn't work here
[05:29:12] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ua7gwxao/2/ <--
[05:29:26] <Cork> the original line also uses the built in tooltip
[05:29:45] <Blinky_> This is the test line for the tooltip what formats the html
[05:29:46] <Blinky_> <li class="button small board_users" id="111" data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="<b>Testing</b> tooltip" >Test</li>
[05:30:06] <Cork> yes, but where do you get it from that you can have html in there?
[05:30:10] <Blinky_> If I use the same line but add the tooltip title using jquery it prevents the formatting
[05:30:16] <Cork> cause the tooltips aren't replaced so it doesn't support html
[05:30:22] <Cork> example
[05:30:26] <Cork> cause i can't reproduce
[05:32:30] <Blinky_> I cant get the tooltip to work in fiddle but I am looking at a working tooltip.  Strange
[06:12:59] <ta7an> guys anyone around? this problem is driving me crazy, i'm using select2 to display back a list of available options with the user's keypresses via ajax
[06:13:20] <ta7an> but in the php side, i always get 'undefined variable: op'
[06:13:32] <ta7an> and i have no idea where in the world did the op variable come from
[06:14:02] <Uhkis> and how is that a jquery question?
[06:14:33] <ta7an> Uhkis: select2 is q jquery plugin
[06:14:38] <ta7an> *jquery *
[06:14:38] <Uhkis> try ##php
[06:17:30] <ta7an> Uhkis: i'm not agreeing with you
[06:17:37] <ta7an> but okey will figure it out
[06:26:58] <Blinky_> ta7an, you will need to provide some code so we can have a look
[06:37:42] <ta7an> Blinky_: here: html element: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/50b4655b45790158ae284050beef9168 || js code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5789b512204808627aeffa048724376f || php controller code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/72e5ba4180f8bc83ba78133ffd586b34
[07:14:29] <robsco> i want to write some js that will sit on a 3rd party website.  how can i detect the existence of jquery (and version) on the site, and if it's not present, inject it?  actually the injecting isn't a problem really
[07:21:51] <Cork> robsco: the by far best option is to with the script provide a requirement for jquery x.y
[07:22:04] <Cork> injecting jquery is a bad idea as it will cause problem for ppl
[07:22:13] <Cork> simpler is better in this case
[07:25:27] <robsco> Cork, thanks, think i'll make it the last-resort option, for the user to opt-in for if they really can't put jQuery on their site
[07:26:10] <Cork> robsco: it would mean you would have to avoid using all of the load helper features of jquery cause you can't use them
[07:26:27] <Cork> like $(document).ready() and the like
[07:26:31] <robsco> ahhh yeah
[07:26:40] <Cork> so again, i REALLY recommend not to go there
[07:26:47] <robsco> not gonna need that necessarily, might even just go pure js
[07:26:52] <Cork> cause you get a long list of annoying async behaviour you have to handle
[07:26:54] <robsco> thanks anyway
[07:27:03] <Cork> both in the script and the site owner will have to deal with it too
[07:27:28] <Cork> robsco: ya, if you want to avoid forcing the  user to include jquery just use vanilla js
[10:54:00] <Jeron> hey #jquery
[10:54:46] <Jeron> https://jsfiddle.net/8f7nasob/ How do I go about solving my checkbox being checked on page load
[10:55:27] <Woet> ..?
[10:55:34] <Woet> what is there to solve and how is it related to jquery?
[10:56:57] <Jeron> I was hoping you may know what I could do to get it to load unchecked. I thought the onclick code was jquery
[10:58:36] <Jeron> sorry wook
[10:58:39] <Jeron>  I was hoping you may know what I could do to get it to load unchecked. I thought the onclick code was jquery
[11:02:14] <Woet> i mean, theres no jquery in your jsfiddle
[11:02:16] <Woet> so thats not possible
[11:02:23] <Woet> did you try looking at the HTML?
[11:02:29] <Woet> it's fairly obvious why it's checked.
[11:05:30] <Jeron> the only thing I see is checked="checked" but I've tried changing that to false,unchecked and still same result
[11:05:43] <Woet> have you considered googling what the syntax is?
[11:06:19] <Jeron> ahh I figured it out :) I just deleted the checked= and it's loading right now
[11:06:36] <Jeron> you got me on the right path and I thank you for that
[11:06:44] <Jeron> sorry for the noobness
[11:28:40] <newbie666> hello
[11:28:56] <newbie666> any idea why my bootstrap tabs and other stuff don't work on a tablet?
[11:29:09] <newbie666> maybe i need to bind touch to click jquery ?
[11:29:29] <newbie666> anyone?
[12:08:25] <mllie> When running this on mobile, when pressing cancel the radio button is still selected. What am I missing? http://jsfiddle.net/yr3zebdh/5/
[15:03:58] <MikeD_> JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( foo ) ) vs $.extend( true, {}, foo )
[17:45:50] <hahuang65> is there an easy way to reload the current page, but in a different format?
[17:46:04] <taplar> elaborate?
[17:46:31] <hahuang65> if I'm on www.foo.com/bar?baz=qux and I want to go to www.foo.com/bar.json?baz=qux
[17:46:56] <taplar> that's a manipulation of the window.location
[17:47:16] <hahuang65> how might one manipulate it?
[17:47:23] <taplar> ask around ##javascript
[17:47:28] <hahuang65> okay thank you :)
[17:47:31] <taplar> sure
[18:23:36] * taplar is thankful for #jquery
[18:24:25] <taplar> it's like crickets in some other rooms
[19:19:38] <gonsays> hey guys,  I have these 2 fields http://imgur.com/6DJjMul with this code https://pastebin.com/vs3J8Fw4 - how can I join matrix_level1_color and matrix_level1_time and post it as matrix_level1?
[20:14:11] <robertmaxrees> gonsays are you doing this via ajax or via a normal form post?
[20:16:24] <gonsays> robertmaxrees, normal form post, but I've solved it manipulating the add.php, thank you! :D
[20:16:30] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[22:14:38] <hanshenrik> which 1 is functionally closest to the following code, .prop or .attr ? ele.setAttribute("foo",ele.foo="bar");  ? or more verbosely, ele.foo="bar"; ele.setAttribute("foo","bar");
[22:21:30] <snover> that doesn’t make much sense. setting a property of an element is the same as setting the equivalent attribute of the element. just set the property.
[22:24:00] <snover> (assuming "foo" is actually a standard DOM property…)
[22:28:35] <hanshenrik> hmm, actually ive had some problems with just doing 1 of ele.something="foo"  OR  ele.setAttribute("something",foo);  and have been doing ele.setAttribute("something",ele.something="foo"); ever since, but it was a long time ago
[22:29:21] <hanshenrik> actually it might have been about a textarea value in internet explorer
[22:29:33] <hanshenrik> not sure
