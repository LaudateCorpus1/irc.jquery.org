[02:13:49] <Cork> digimer: the recommendated solution is to set a cache header from the server
[02:14:05] <Cork> there you can set how old the cache can be before it matters
[02:14:19] <Cork> (like 10 minutes or something like that)
[02:14:37] <Cork> THAT is the recommended solution
[02:15:00] <Cork> digimer: for clarity, it isn't jquery caching anything it is the browser, it is even transparent to jquery
[02:15:34] <Cork> what cache: false does is append a timestamp to the url so it never gets a cache hit
[02:15:53] <Cork> but that means you will cause network load when you might not need to
[02:30:08] <pila> hello, anyone familiar with highcharts? i have multiple series (8) 2 have very high numbers, and the other 6 have quite low numbers, so the layout gets pretty messed up because of those high numbers, is there a way to normalize this?
[02:42:38] <Cork> pila: i would recommend asking in there support forums
[04:16:46] <folabi> hello guys
[04:16:50] <folabi> i need some help on jqm
[04:16:55] <folabi> I'm using $.mobile.changePage but i notice an unwanted refresh, i'm pretty sure it is normal but i want to avoid this.
[04:17:00] <folabi> What i'm trying to get is this :
[04:17:06] <folabi> When i click on "Start date" I would like to have "Start the" on the nextpage hightlight and only "DepartureDateTab" datepicker visible.
[04:17:11] <folabi> You can see there is a quick hightlight. You will understand better with this jsfiddle link : https://jsfiddle.net/x4wo2yrk/
[04:17:15] <folabi> hope somebody can help
[04:24:31] <v01d4lph4> Hello jQuery gods! I had a problem and I have scoured most of internet but couldn't find a solution.
[04:25:07] <v01d4lph4> My problem is that I am downloading a mp3 binary as blob and then loading it into <audio> element.
[04:25:41] <v01d4lph4> Since I am using ajax, I have to wait for the whole file to download using  if (xhr.status == 200) {         audioLink.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(xhr.response);             }
[04:26:21] <v01d4lph4> I was wondering if there is a way so I could start streaming the audio parallel, with the download running in the background.
[04:26:40] <v01d4lph4> Current implementation is something like - http://tech.chitgoks.com/2015/09/12/download-mp3-stream-via-ajax-then-load-to-html5-audio/
[04:38:02] <Birliban> hi, could someone help me out with the twitter typeahead plugin... I have this https://jsfiddle.net/d1e1kLz3/2/ but I dont get any suggestion from the plugin. Console says no errors...
[05:40:21] <blinky_> Morning all, I have a script for add space to a select option list which works great, however, I can only get it working correctly if I use monospace font, could someone please have a look and let me know how I can fix it to use a different font? - https://jsfiddle.net/zn8mur2h/
[05:46:01] <Cork> Birliban: only recommendation i can give you is to set breakpoints and debug the plugin
[05:47:44] <Cork> blinky_: only real option is to not use a dropdown
[05:48:02] <Cork> blinky_: <select> is a replaced element so css can't control it
[05:48:57] <Cork> and as none monospace fonts has different sized characters it becomes quite hard to figure out how many spaces you would have to add to align them
[05:50:08] <Cork> blinky_: for example you could use jquery ui autocomplete
[05:51:38] <Cork> blinky_: ex. https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[06:09:20] <blinky_> Cork, ok cheers, I will have a look at changing over, does the autocomplete option have the ability to complete what I am trying to achieve?
[06:09:38] <Cork> yes
[06:09:48] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[06:09:54] <Cork> you can style each entry how every you like
[06:10:18] <blinky_> great cheers
[06:17:18] <digimer> Cork: Thanks for the follow up. I had already added '<head> <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="max-age=0" /> <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache" /> <meta http-equiv="expires" content="0" /> <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Tue, 01 Jan 1980 1:00:00 GMT" /> <meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache" /> ... </head>', but it seemed like chrome ignored it all
[06:17:43] <Cork> digimer: i wouldn't recommend using meta tags for tyhat
[06:17:45] <Cork> *that
[06:17:48] <digimer> in our case, the webui is not for a web page, per se, but for an appliance we've built that has a web UI
[06:17:49] <Cork> set real http headers
[06:18:15] <digimer> oh? I'm not sure how to do that... My communication with the webserver if via cgi scripts on the server
[06:18:33] <Cork> cause meta http-equiv only works if the proxy can parse and understand html
[06:18:46] <Cork> while the http header is for everyone that understands http
[06:19:16] <Cork> digimer: you would have to look into how the cgi program can set headers then
[06:19:22] <digimer> there is no proxy, at least not in the traditional sense
[06:19:22] <Cork> it most likely can
[06:19:28] <digimer> OK
[06:19:36] <Cork> digimer: proxy as in the cache proxy in the browser
[06:19:48] <digimer> ah
[06:19:49] <Cork> or there can be transparent proxies between your server and the client and so on
[06:20:01] <Cork> and all of them need to get this cache info
[06:25:06] <digimer> well that was surprisingly easy
[06:25:50] <digimer> just print what I want to set as headers... So long as the last print had two new lines to break header from body, you're good to go
[06:25:53] <digimer> thanks, Cork

[07:08:20] <fas3r> I execute a function when clicking on a button. When clicked, I use "    $('div.formExtendL3').filter(':visible')    " to interact on all div with class formExtendL3 which are visible .  However, How can I do to add a condition to exclude the closest div with the class formExtendL3 ? ( Basically, to not trigger the action on the parent div where was clicked the button) Can I use not and closest ?
[07:10:25] <shoky> fas3r: yep. e.g.   .not( $(this).closest('...') )
[07:10:41] <`ULT> Hello, I added a click event to div.product-thumb but i want exclude the button inside this div. How can I achieve this? I have tried not but this is not working.

[07:32:26] <Cork> lambaoy: what are you trying to do=
[07:32:28] <Cork> *?
[07:32:38] <lambaoy> cut the text
[07:32:48] <lambaoy> substring
[07:32:49] <Cork> well you're not saving the result
[07:32:51] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/fzhtu86c/3/
[07:33:48] <lambaoy> Cork, I want output on html to change too
[07:33:59] <Cork> on html?
[07:34:04] <lambaoy> yes =)
[07:34:09] <Cork> you mean you want to change the content of the element?
[07:34:16] <Cork> cause there is no html
[07:34:16] <lambaoy> yes
[07:34:36] <lambaoy> <div id="demo">hello again</div>
[07:34:40] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/fzhtu86c/4/
[07:34:59] <Cork> note that if you have elements with event handlers or something inside demo
[07:35:04] <Cork> those will be lost after this
[07:35:12] <lambaoy> the result should be "hello" only

[07:36:29] <Cork> but again, note that this replaces everything inside demo, so if you have any event handlers or bound javascript or anything like that
[07:36:33] <Cork> those will stop working
[07:36:54] <lambaoy> thats fine =)
[07:36:58] <lambaoy> thx u
[09:55:45] <tocka> could someone tell me why am i not getting anything back?
[09:55:46] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/hhf2m6tw/1/
[09:56:28] <tocka> I will have multiple tables with the same table and I want to calculate their widths by suming up <tr> tag widths
[09:56:28] <tocka> :|
[09:57:45] <tocka> Ok fixed it :D
[09:57:49] <tocka> included jquery ui
[09:57:52] <tocka> instead of jquery..
[09:58:57] <tocka> its a bit weird now.. Its only returning the size of the first to cells
[09:58:58] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/hhf2m6tw/2/
[09:59:06] <tocka> if the size of the 3 cells is different
[09:59:13] <tocka> then its ok.. why is it like that :|
[10:05:16] <pavonia> tocka: Works fine for me, even if all three have the same width
[10:05:26] <tocka> yep it does :D
[10:08:18] <Cork> tocka: $($(this).find('tr:first th')).each => $(this).find('tr:first th').each
[10:08:27] <Cork> no need for the extra jquery wrapping
[10:08:33] <tocka> O_o
[10:08:35] <tocka> well this look fancy
[10:09:04] <Cork> tocka: i meant this https://jsfiddle.net/hhf2m6tw/3/
[10:09:10] <Cork> no need for the extra $() in there
[10:09:38] <tocka> ohh.. got it :)
[10:09:39] <tocka> thanks!
[10:10:16] <Cork> tocka: also instead of tr:first you could think about using thead/tbody might make things cleaner
[10:10:31] <Cork> depending on what you are trying to do at least
[10:11:10] <tocka> what im trying to do is to set a fixed size to a table depending of what I defined in the <th> tags
[10:11:23] <tocka> Like get the width of $("th").attr("width");
[10:11:26] <tocka> sum it up
[10:11:32] <tocka> and add it to a table
[10:11:39] <tocka> so it would have a set width
[10:11:46] <tocka> because right now it expands through the full page
[10:12:22] <tocka> basically every month the table will be growing
[10:12:33] <tocka> and the data is displayed vertically
[10:12:39] <tocka> so yeh..
[10:12:55] <Cork> hmm, that shouldn't be a problem
[10:13:21] <tocka> well i did it already:)
[10:13:23] <tocka> thanks!:)
[10:13:38] <Cork> tocka: sounds like you have width: 100%; somewhere on the table
[10:13:56] <Cork> cause it should take the width of the columns by default
[10:14:08] <tocka> ffs
[10:14:09] <tocka> :|
[10:14:13] <tocka> yes..
[10:14:27] <Cork> could you reproduce a table in jsfiddle that shows the problem you're talking about?
[10:14:58] <tocka> its ok Cork, i sorted it out.. Basically the problem is sort of with the foundation framework
[10:15:16] <tocka> im talking about CSS framework
[10:15:24] <tocka> it has table { width:100%; }
[10:15:27] <Cork> so override the width
[10:15:40] <Cork> .table-extended { width: auto; }
[10:15:45] <tocka> yep
[10:15:48] <tocka> thats what im going to do
[10:15:49] <tocka> :|
[10:15:51] <Cork> heh
[10:17:06] <tocka> thanks again:)
[10:42:54] <Es0teric> question -- if i am calling a plugin on a specific js file but its returning undefined, what could be the cause of that?
[10:43:39] <taplar> the plugin doesn't return a value?
[10:44:03] <Cork> Es0teric: javascript doesn't have files
[10:44:04] <Es0teric> taplar no like.. lets say if i call bp.react.start(); that would return undefined but if i call bp.react it shows all the methods within it
[10:44:15] <Cork> it is in the javascript scope or it isn't
[10:44:35] <taplar> start() doesn't have to return anything
[10:45:12] <Es0teric> taplar hmmm but its not actually doing what start() does
[10:45:12] <taplar> does it return something?
[10:45:14] <Cork> and ya, start: function() {} would return underinfed
[10:45:46] <Cork> Es0teric: you would have to debug the function to understand why
[10:46:01] <Cork> return value doesn't really tell you anything in that regard
[10:46:10] <Es0teric> i see
[11:12:41] <folabi> hi guys
[11:12:56] <folabi> i need little help on jqm
[11:13:56] <folabi> do somebody know how to wait until $.mobile.changePage finish
[11:15:06] <folabi> without using the method $(document).on("pageshow" ...
[11:15:22] <folabi> this is my code :
[11:15:22] <folabi> $("#datepicker-departure, #datepicker-return").click(function () { 	$.mobile.changePage('#search-date') 	var dateTab = $(this).attr("id") == "datepicker-departure" ? "departuredate-tab" : "returndate-tab"; 	console.warn("this : " + dateTab); });
[11:16:15] <folabi> i'm trying to have my console.warn execute when $.mobile.changePage finish
[11:20:09] <taplar> http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagechange/
[11:20:35] <taplar> take note of the deprecated mentionings for that and for the changePage though
[11:21:29] <folabi> thanks taplar
[11:22:02] <folabi> but i need to if the click have been made on "datepicker-departure" or "datepicker-departure"
[11:25:44] <Es0teric> finally figured it out.. had to add the call on a .done() method in ajax
[12:07:56] <hhee2> guys, i have a from. how can i do when form submit failed, send form to another failback server? is it real?
[12:08:28] <hhee2> forgot, i need ajax
[12:08:58] <taplar> you are using ajax already?
[12:12:11] <hhee2> taplar, in this case not yet. in another part of system - yes, i am. i just think the more handy way to do it
[12:12:44] <taplar> i'm not disagreeing.  just inquiring about your situation
[12:13:17] <hhee2> taplar, got it. i just never did it before, not im' thinking :)
[12:13:21] <hhee2> now*
[12:14:13] <hhee2> taplar, i can do simple thing use $.ajax function
[12:14:58] <hhee2> i've just started work as junior webdeveloper
[14:41:30] <beshoo> I heat SAFARi
[14:41:40] <beshoo> https://instaranker.com/panel/test.html
[14:41:55] <beshoo> why this click me is not able to work on the F*** safari
[14:44:21] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pointerup
[14:44:25] <taplar> it's not supported
[14:53:45] <beshoo> even on.("click")
[14:54:54] <taplar> what?
[14:56:33] <Es0teric> how do i hook on to an ajax call that is occuring on a specific div?
[14:56:47] <Es0teric> without overwriting the actual file that the ajax call is in?
[14:57:18] <taplar> an ajax call isn't in a file
[14:57:19] <taplar> it can be in a function
[14:57:22] <beshoo> https://instaranker.com/panel/test.html
[14:57:26] <beshoo> check it
[14:57:36] <beshoo> not work on the safari
[14:57:45] <taplar> beshoo: i already looked at your code and I told you why
[14:57:52] <beshoo>  $(document).on("click", ".activityStatusButton", function() {
[14:57:56] <taplar> pointerup is not supported by safari, as shown by that mdn link
[14:58:06] <beshoo> even on click
[14:58:06] <beshoo> ?
[14:58:46] <taplar> i would assume it would be, but I don't know.  and the mdn doesn't list it
[14:59:01] <beshoo> SFARI is dump browser
[14:59:12] <beshoo> i dont know how apple made it
[14:59:32] <taplar> ok?  what do you want us to do about it
[14:59:41] <beshoo> i am losing my users cos this f**** brwser
[14:59:54] <beshoo> just to understad why
[14:59:55] <beshoo>  $(document).on("click", ".activityStatusButton", function() {
[15:00:03] <beshoo> not working on it
[15:00:13] <beshoo> which is a very easy jq code
[15:00:27] <taplar> have you tried to use a basic js binding and see if that works?
[15:00:45] <beshoo> no i am using jq with all my pages
[15:01:04] <taplar> try a basic one and see if it works.  if it does not, then it may be that safari doesn't support click
[15:01:06] <beshoo> i have tons of jq code , do i have to change it all
[15:01:21] <taplar> i'm talking about debugging.  not a whole sale replacement
[15:01:33] <taplar> you're over reacting man
[15:04:00] <goodenough> $('.activityStatusButton').on('click'
[15:04:07] <goodenough> that doesn't work?
[15:05:03] <taplar> actually i misread this.  mdn does say safari supports click
[15:05:25] <robertmaxrees> beshoo any console errors or network problems?
[15:06:34] <robertmaxrees> hah welp
[15:06:47] * taplar shrugs
[15:06:56] <Es0teric> taplar i have a better question actually... how do i parse a get variable string into an array of objects?
[15:07:17] <taplar> you mean a uri component string?
[15:07:48] <taplar> ?key1=value1&key2=value2 <-- ?
[15:07:57] <Es0teric> taplar yes
[15:08:03] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways
[15:08:15] <Es0teric> which is the most efficient one, robertmaxrees ?
[15:08:20] <taplar> afaik, you have to manually write the split and build logic.  idk of a built in way
[15:08:26] <robertmaxrees> "efficient" or...?
[15:08:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees scratch that
[15:08:49] <Es0teric> just which is one of the ways to do it
[15:08:51] <taplar> you could probably write a regex for a replace() to grab them all too
[15:08:57] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's one way.
[15:09:04] <Es0teric> whats another?
[15:09:06] <robertmaxrees> or you can do a split and a map.
[15:11:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/63f3hdqg/
[15:11:03] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.,
[15:11:36] <robertmaxrees> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[15:11:39] <robertmaxrees> here's another.
[15:12:59] <robertmaxrees> depending on the final format you're looking for.
[15:19:07] <Es0teric> ok so if i am on $(document).ajaxComplete(function( event, xhr, options)) {} right? how do i check for a new ajax call after all the other ajax calls have loaded?
[15:20:07] <taplar> you lost me on the last part
[15:20:47] <Es0teric> ok so after all the other calls have loaded right?
[15:20:51] <robertmaxrees> ^ heh
[15:20:59] <Es0teric> how do i check for a new one AFTER all of that
[15:21:30] <taplar> what are you calling 'loaded'?
[15:22:11] <Es0teric> taplar ajaxComplete
[15:22:15] <Es0teric> oh
[15:22:20] <Es0teric> all ajax calls that trigger on pageload
[15:22:37] <robertmaxrees> you want to differentiate between an autocomplete call and the calls that happen on pageload?
[15:22:47] <Es0teric> yes
[15:23:38] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:24:06] <Es0teric> because i need to hook on an ajax call to call a refresh method... and i cant modify the original file its in
[15:24:18] <Es0teric> which is making it even more frustrating
[15:24:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[15:24:24] <robertmaxrees> why can't you?
[15:24:29] <Es0teric> my boss said i cant
[15:24:34] <Es0teric> thats more than enough reason i need
[15:24:39] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[15:25:03] <Es0teric> yeah
[15:25:09] <robertmaxrees> why do people say "DO THIS TASK BUT YOU MAY NOT TOUCH XYZ FILES TO DO SO"
[15:25:16] <robertmaxrees> like, what?
[15:25:16] <Es0teric> even if it means duplicating the file and just adding one line
[15:25:23] <Es0teric> for it to be overwritten
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> you can'
[15:25:34] <Es0teric> i cannot
[15:25:39] <robertmaxrees> *can't really "overwirte" like that.
[15:25:40] <Es0teric> so i need to find an alternate way
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> that's totally absurd tho.
[15:25:52] <Es0teric> yeah i agree
[15:26:03] <robertmaxrees> so while you start looking for a new job, you can look at the URLs in that global ajax handler.
[15:26:19] <Es0teric> i mean its not that bad
[15:26:33] <robertmaxrees> holding files as sacred is pretty scary imo
[15:26:41] <taplar> ^
[15:26:47] <Es0teric> its a wp site man
[15:26:50] <Es0teric> i initially did it in the child theme
[15:26:52] <Es0teric> which should be ok
[15:26:55] <Es0teric> but that was not allowed
[15:27:05] <Es0teric> so i have to find another way
[15:27:14] <taplar> what does js have to do with a wp theme?
[15:27:23] <Es0teric> taplar seriously?
[15:27:29] <taplar> i am
[15:27:48] <Es0teric> have you even worked with wordpress before?
[15:28:07] <taplar> if you are writing custom js logic and it's bound so tightly that you have to use a specific wp theme, that to me screams it's too tightly coupled
[15:28:22] <Es0teric> taplar doesnt matter
[15:28:34] <Es0teric> its a wp theme that was bought and heavily modified in the child theme
[15:28:36] <taplar> well, with an argument like that
[15:28:47] <Es0teric> with that being said
[15:28:51] <Es0teric> this does not help my main issue at hand
[15:31:19] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric i gave you a solution fwiw :)
[15:31:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees that doesnt work for me
[15:32:11] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:32:21] <robertmaxrees> checking the url in the global ajax event handler?
[15:33:32] <Es0teric> the problem is that its all calling the same fetch
[15:33:42] <Es0teric> ajax endpoint
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> with different URLs, right?
[15:35:10] <robertmaxrees> querystring params and stuff?
[15:38:52] <Es0teric> there are no different urls
[15:39:05] <Es0teric> its just POST requests to an ajax endpoint, robertmaxrees
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> okay, so the post body is different for each?
[15:44:20] <tsukasadt> I need to run an AJAX request that resubmits the request if it fails to produce a valid result, but I can't base valid status on the status code. Easy, I test the results, instead. Here's my problem, how can I do this without building a backlog in the active memory?
[15:45:26] <taplar> what backlog are you referring to?
[15:47:16] <tsukasadt> Everytime the XHR runs, the memory usage of the process increases and it keeps doing so until the result is either valid or the browser crashes.
[15:48:09] <taplar> sounds like something isn't scoped properly then
[15:48:14] <tsukasadt> Here's the code: https://thepasteb.in/p/NxhrcR2p648noTO
[15:49:37] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric see my question?
[15:49:41] <taplar> yeah, as soon as the next ajax call starts and that menthod ends, the previous vars should be available for garbage collection.
[15:49:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause my solution still applies there.
[15:50:02] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees post body is not different from each
[15:50:08] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:50:26] <robertmaxrees> so it's literally the same ajax call every time?
[15:50:39] <robertmaxrees> the autocomplete ajax call is the same as all the other ones fired on pageload?
[15:50:47] <taplar> tsukasadt: though if that is being called a lot you could potentially pull that method out and name it so that it's not being created for each ajax call.
[15:51:05] <tsukasadt> taplar, any way to force it to be trashed? I connect to the system via RDP, so it also locks up the RDP connection until the browser crashes or it succeeds. :S
[15:51:56] <taplar> i'm unaware of any way of js to request the gc run
[15:52:12] <taplar> you just have to make sure variables no longer have a reference for them to be eligible
[15:52:36] <taplar> since those are vars in the method, those would be unreferenced after that function ends
[15:53:15] <tsukasadt> Yeah, but the function doesn't end until the call is successful. It could end up nested in the dozens.
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> aaaand i give up hahaha
[15:53:34] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no
[15:53:36] <Es0teric> its not the same
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric wat
[15:53:47] <Es0teric> its called in different instances
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric what's different between them then?
[15:53:52] <taplar> the success method ends, after the returns from starting the next ajax call
[15:53:57] <robertmaxrees> i care only about the url and/or body.
[15:54:00] <taplar> if it goes in the catch part
[15:54:06] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees -- one gets called on infinite scroll
[15:54:09] <Es0teric> thats the one that i want to target
[15:54:32] <robertmaxrees> does anything about the uri or body make that one unique?
[15:54:47] <Es0teric> no
[15:55:02] <robertmaxrees> so you're literally making the same ajax call over and over on that page?
[15:55:05] <tsukasadt> I suppose I'm stuck, then. ty for taking a look, taplar. :)
[15:55:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees im not.. the theme that was created is
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> "you're" is generic there.
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying you wrote the code, simply what the page is doing.
[15:55:36] <Es0teric> yeah
[15:55:40] <Es0teric> thats what the page is doing then
[15:55:40] <robertmaxrees> i dunno how any of that makes sense, then.
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> what point is there to firing the exact same ajax call over and over like that?
[15:56:03] <Es0teric> im the wrong person to ask
[15:56:04] <taplar> tsukasadt: i'd definitely see about pulling the success method out, naming it, and referencing it.  that would definitely reduce the amount of method creations you are causing
[15:56:06] <Es0teric> idk why its doing that
[15:56:21] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so why are you trying to hook into that call again?
[15:56:29] <Es0teric> because i have emojis
[15:56:33] <Es0teric> and i need them to load on that call
[15:56:55] <Es0teric> right now they load everywhere else BUT when the ajax call gets more content for the infinite scroll
[15:56:56] <robertmaxrees> and the code handling the scroll doesn't have a callback you can hook into?
[15:57:01] <Es0teric> no
[15:57:08] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you then.
[15:57:10] <Es0teric> this is whats making it so difficult to do
[15:57:18] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of SOL unless you fire on all ajax calls then.
[15:57:26] <Es0teric> thats what im saying
[15:57:31] <Es0teric> but my boss wants me to find an alternate way
[15:57:43] <Es0teric> which doesnt seem to make sense... the way i did it by modifying the is the only way
[15:57:51] <Es0teric> *the file
[15:58:01] <tsukasadt> taplar, you mean like this: https://thepasteb.in/p/Z4hVcy1QOMzAmtX
[15:58:02] <Es0teric> the file that the infinite scroll is using to fire the event
[15:58:43] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric then you're stuck.  your boss is telling you to do something that is pretty unreasonable.
[15:58:48] <robertmaxrees> unless he knows something we don't.
[16:04:36] <AwkwardCough> taplar is having network issues
[16:04:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees he sent me this though..https://github.com/joelpurra/jquery-mutation-summary
[16:05:09] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[16:05:14] <Es0teric> so im supposed to look for the mutator of where the infinite scroll is loading
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> that';s a really really bnad idea.
[16:05:23] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[16:05:31] <Es0teric> idk how im going to make it work though
[16:05:38] <Es0teric> i dont like how it works for this specific case
[16:06:01] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[16:06:07] <robertmaxrees> don't need a plugin.
[16:06:18] <robertmaxrees> great way to cause an infinite loop buuut (shrug)
[16:08:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees there was an infinite loop before
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) your boss is suggesting to increase pageload time and hook in using another way to potentially cause an infinite loop.
[16:10:51] <Es0teric> yeah
[16:13:02] * taplar lives again!!!!!!!
[16:17:26] * robertmaxrees hides
[16:19:16] <taplar> whahahahahahaha
[16:22:13] <taplar> i want to watch more of the senate thing, but i think they hacked my network connection
[16:22:17] <taplar> only explanation
[16:22:32] <robertmaxrees> russia
[16:22:39] <taplar> wurd
[16:22:58] * AwkwardCough 
[16:44:55] <Violinist> england is the problem
[17:46:19] <otahak> howdy folks. I need help figuring out how to send a specific bit of data through x-editable, as attempting to do so in ajaxOptions: {data: var} seems to override the x-editable object it attempts to send by default
[17:49:12] <otahak> nvm found a better way thanks anyway!
[18:44:49] <onec> I am trying to communicate between a webpage and a nodejs express server using jquery ajax jsonp method. However, in node, when i try to display req.body it displays as undefined even though i specify it. any thoughts? My code is here https://pastebin.com/PHQaxxyk
[18:45:37] <robertmaxrees> method: "POST"
[18:45:45] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[18:45:59] <robertmaxrees> though that's not really JSONP any more iirc.
[18:47:06] <robertmaxrees> basically, req.body is populated when you post data to the server and then parse it using middleware.
[18:47:36] <taplar> didn't think you could do post with jsonp
[18:47:41] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[18:47:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:48:14] <robertmaxrees> onec if you control the server, why use JSONP?
[18:48:36] <onec> When i try to use a regular jquery get it throws an error because of that cross origin thing
[18:48:52] <robertmaxrees> so why not put the page on the same server?
[18:49:17] <onec> All im trying to do is scrape a webpage of a given URL in javascript, so my solution was to have a server do it and return the result to the webpage bc it is hard to scrape pages in javascript. is there a better way to do this?
[18:49:36] <taplar> is the response from the webpage json?
[18:49:49] <robertmaxrees> onec just random pages?
[18:50:12] <taplar> because jsonp is specifically expecting json as the response
[18:50:20] <robertmaxrees> jsonp is the wrong tool, basically.
[18:50:27] <onec> given a word, it will just go to http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/<word> and get the pronounciation
[18:50:39] <taplar> not an answer to my question
[18:51:39] <taplar> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duck <-- that's not json
[18:52:13] <onec> oh ok yeah. not json. what would be the best way to get the html of this page in javascript?
[18:52:29] <taplar> make the request from server side
[18:52:51] <taplar> if you can't change that source to allow your ajax request, which i'm assume you cannot
[18:53:01] <onec> how can i communicate between the web page and the server?
[18:53:24] <taplar> your page -> your server -> their server -> response to your server -> response to your page
[18:53:27] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[18:53:36] <robertmaxrees> are you building a plugin or something?
[18:53:45] <onec> the regular $.get() method doesn't work if i own the web page and the server i thought?
[18:53:47] <robertmaxrees> like, you said you're building a scraper?
[18:54:12] <onec> no im not building a scraper. nodejs has scraping libraries. im just using them in my application
[18:54:20] <robertmaxrees> so what are you building?
[18:54:45] <onec> users types a word into a text box, the page returns the pronounciation is all i need
[18:55:03] <onec> the pronounciation is taken from the html source of wiktionary page
[18:55:11] <robertmaxrees> okay, that's where that comes into play.
[18:55:13] <robertmaxrees> so.
[18:55:25] <robertmaxrees> is the text input hosted on your own page?
[18:55:28] <onec> yes
[18:55:34] <robertmaxrees> then cors isn't an issue.
[18:55:42] <robertmaxrees> since you're using your server-side to scrape.
[18:55:48] <onec> so i can use the regular $.get method?
[18:55:51] <robertmaxrees> since your server is making the request, you're fine.
[18:55:59] <robertmaxrees> if the get is pointing back to your own box, yeah.
[18:56:50] <onec> oh. so if im temporarily just using localhost as the server then it wont work
[18:57:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:57:23] <robertmaxrees> is your long term goal to use ajax to hit wiktionary?
[18:57:38] <robertmaxrees> or always go through your own server?
[18:58:01] <onec> ohhh. i misunderstood. so i can get the html of the wiktionary page directly from my web page?
[18:58:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:58:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:58:10] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm getting at.
[18:58:19] <robertmaxrees> wikitionary probably doesn't allow cors.
[18:58:36] <robertmaxrees> so if you're using ajax (which $.get() uses under the hood), you'll need to hit your own box.
[18:59:05] <robertmaxrees> so it's $.ajax() -> your box -> grab and scrape 3rd party site -> return scraped data.
[18:59:14] <onec> ok. so lets say i have a node server runinng on my machine that takes a word and gets the pronounciation. how do i pass it a word and print the result
[18:59:41] <onec> would it be $.get()?
[18:59:56] <taplar> really depends on how/when you do the scraping
[18:59:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:00:14] <taplar> are you scraping upon request?
[19:00:17] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax({ url: 'http:/foo.com', method: 'GET' }) is the same thing.
[19:00:21] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[19:00:22] <taplar> or like a cron job thing?
[19:00:25] <robertmaxrees> you'd use a normal get request.
[19:00:46] <onec> im not sure what a cron job is, but yes, it would scrape the page once it receives the word
[19:01:00] <onec> and oh ok thanks robertmaxrees
[19:01:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah so the workflow i mentioned.
[19:01:07] <onec> alright understood
[19:01:12] <robertmaxrees> to the url is your own servber.
[19:01:39] <robertmaxrees> so url: "http://yourserver.com?word=foo"
[19:02:28] <robertmaxrees> then req.query.word is your word on the server side.
[19:02:53] <onec> do i not need to pass a data object in the get method like the second to last example https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[19:03:04] <onec> if i pass the word in the url
[19:03:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the get method necessarily.
[19:03:20] <robertmaxrees> and the data object is slapped in as querystring params for get requests.
[19:05:34] <onec> I tried doing that and now it passes a cors error
[19:05:35] <onec> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:3000/pronounce?word=duck. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).
[19:06:00] <robertmaxrees> are you serving the html page up via the same server and hitting it via http://localhost:3000
[19:06:01] <taplar> is port 3000 in your url?
[19:06:24] <onec> yes
[19:06:26] <onec> https://pastebin.com/uvQV4BC2
[19:06:29] <onec> this is my code
[19:06:37] <robertmaxrees> not the code.
[19:06:40] <robertmaxrees> the actual page itself.
[19:06:48] <robertmaxrees> are you serving it via the server, as well?
[19:07:02] <robertmaxrees> like, is http://localhost:3000 in your address bar?
[19:07:07] <onec> no
[19:07:10] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[19:07:13] <onec> its the file in my directory
[19:07:27] <robertmaxrees> gotta serve it with the server
[19:07:42] <onec> oh. so do i need to set up like a wamp server on my computer or is there an easier way
[19:07:52] <robertmaxrees> you can use express to serve the page.
[19:07:55] <taplar> can your node server not serve up the html page?
[19:08:06] <robertmaxrees> taplar i don't know that he knows how to do that :)_
[19:08:13] <onec> yeah i don't sorry
[19:08:18] <robertmaxrees> it's not that hard.
[19:08:19] <taplar> well, if he knows how to make it scrape, :D
[19:08:34] <robertmaxrees> https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html
[19:09:26] <onec> ok one sec
[19:12:39] <onec> ok the webpage is hosted on the same server. no cors error. now it says that req.body is undefined
[19:13:57] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:14:01] <robertmaxrees> because you're not posting data.
[19:14:07] <robertmaxrees> you're doing a get.
[19:14:30] <robertmaxrees> so you want req.query
[19:14:55] <onec> it works!
[19:14:58] <onec> thank you so much
[19:16:11] <robertmaxrees> aces
[19:16:34] <taplar> cron jobs on the brain
[19:17:59] <fred15> hi there, I hope you are doing well. Quick silly question about the following code:
[19:18:16] <taplar> if it's multiline code, please make a fiddle
[19:18:30] <fred15> hi taplar, i will
[19:23:47] <fred15> @taplar
[19:23:48] <fred15> https://jsfiddle.net/ujfszx41/
[19:24:22] <taplar> i'm assuming '$get' is a namespaced jQuery variable?
[19:24:28] <fred15> I don't understand why using $get('ElementId')
[19:24:52] <fred15> maybe, I don't know. The code is old and messy
[19:25:04] <fred15> thank you very much for your time and for helping me
[19:25:06] <taplar> just going off of syntax i'd think it'd have to be
[19:25:17] <taplar> so which part are you having an issue with?
[19:26:45] <fred15> because of new migration, we are using jquery-2.2.3.min.js
[19:27:21] <fred15> and that part doesn't work anymore, it crash. I was looking the documentatio for that $get and I just found $.get() which is different
[19:27:49] <fred15> some old areas contains $body = $get('body');
[19:28:07] <taplar> yeah, someone namespaced $ as $get for some reason
[19:29:24] <taplar> so $get('#ClientID'); is most likely the same as $('#ClientID'); functionally
[19:31:23] <taplar> though this is very strange, the whole if logic and putting the array on the jquery object
[19:31:46] <taplar> personally i'd be interested if you could revert back to what you had that worked, and console.log($get) to make sure that it is jQuery
[19:31:48] <fred15> I tried it
[19:32:23] <fred15> this $('#ClientID').ClientPartnerIDs -> crash
[19:32:38] <fred15> let me take a look :)
[19:32:38] <taplar> right, cause $ most likely doesn't exist.  someone namespaced it as $get
[19:35:24] <fred15> taplar
[19:35:26] <fred15> function Sys.UI.DomElement.getElementById()
[19:35:32] <taplar> yeah, that's not jquery
[19:35:43] <fred15> lovely...
[19:36:12] <fred15> the more code I saw, the more I understand why they fired the previous guy here...
[19:36:18] <taplar> so, you have another hunt on your hands.  figure out wth that is, :)
[19:36:47] <fred15> Thank you so much! Muchas gracias! Domo arigatou!
[19:37:07] <taplar> de nada
[19:37:22] <fred15> God bless you :D
[19:38:09] <taplar> hasta manana mi amigos
[19:39:55] <fred15> date una vuelta por https://es.stackoverflow.com :D
[20:27:43] <beshoo1> hello all , why this is not working on safari  $(document).on("click", ".activityStatusButton", function() {})
[20:29:03] <robertmaxrees> got a test case that isn't working?
[20:29:44] <robertmaxrees> also: do you mean all safari or safari mobile?
[20:30:33] <robertmaxrees> beshoo1
[20:30:35] <beshoo1>  safari mobile?
[20:30:38] <beshoo1>  safari mobile
[20:30:44] <robertmaxrees> so it's on safari mobile?
[20:30:47] <beshoo1> it dos not work at all
[20:31:00] <beshoo1> yes on mobile , but i dont know on disktop since i dont have mac
[20:31:05] <robertmaxrees> safari mobile has a bug that doesn't allow delegated handlers to work on <body>
[20:31:20] <robertmaxrees> *on or past <body>
[20:31:27] <beshoo1> i am sure there is a workarround
[20:31:36] <beshoo1> what is your advice
[20:31:40] <robertmaxrees> bind lower than body.
[20:31:44] <robertmaxrees> or use a different handler.
[20:31:51] <robertmaxrees> like touchstart
[20:31:53] <robertmaxrees> or touchend
[20:31:55] <robertmaxrees> if it's mobile.
[20:33:01] <beshoo1> well i test something like $(document).on("click touchend" ... to support PC and mac , but the problem the action fired 2 time when i am on android
[20:33:17] <beshoo1> sorry for my english
[20:33:42] <beshoo1> i am from Syria , so please excuse  me
[20:33:49] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to handle it.
[20:33:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd just bind lower though.
[20:33:57] <beshoo1> kindly advice
[20:34:16] <beshoo1> yes i did bind "click touchend"
[20:34:16] <robertmaxrees> since binding that high can quickly lead to later headaches.
[20:34:54] <beshoo1> but when i used that on android  "click touchend"  i got a problem
[20:35:11] <robertmaxrees> right, so don't bind to document or body and just use click.
[20:35:13] <robertmaxrees> bind lower.
[20:35:45] <beshoo1> can i bin the global div ?
[20:35:53] <robertmaxrees> so long as it's lower than body.
[20:36:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd try that out.
[20:36:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, google is your best friend here :)
[20:36:14] <robertmaxrees> I gotta go.
[20:36:17] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[20:36:24] <beshoo1> i am here since google give up :)_
[20:36:36] <beshoo1> but THANK YOU
[20:36:46] <beshoo1> let me test it now
[20:38:07] <beshoo1> BTW on mac safari do we have same problem
[20:38:17] <beshoo1> i dont know and i can not test since i have no mac
[21:24:07] <liqcel> noob question
[21:24:36] <liqcel> does this not work for all instances of this class? $('.sku_button').click(function(){
[21:25:19] <liqcel> I want the function to be called when any element with that class is clicked
[23:30:13] <beshoo1> i have a dimmer nad inside it there is a button , i want to click it , now the code is $(".globalbody").on("click", ".addTimeButton", function() {}) which  .globalbody is a div after <body> content evry thing . since (safari mobile has a bug that doesn't allow delegated handlers to work on <body>)
[23:30:33] <beshoo1> i was using $(document)
[23:30:46] <beshoo1> now any thing in dimmer is not working
[23:34:13] <pavonia> Could you make that a fiddle? It's not clear to me what you are asking
[23:35:49] <beshoo1> mmmmm kind hard
[23:36:08] <beshoo1> let me try
[23:53:14] <beshoo1> i got the problem but i dont know how to solve it , the dimmer is auto created and injected inside body but outside of my global .globalbody div contener
