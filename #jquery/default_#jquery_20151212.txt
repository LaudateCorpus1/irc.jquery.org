[04:29:13] <easyOnMe> hello folks
[04:29:48] <easyOnMe> I need some help with this code here http://jsfiddle.net/uekop32L/10/
[04:30:36] <easyOnMe> for some reason I could not figure out the reason why after I fill all the droppables to the right with at least one box and the draggable goes missing by fading out
[04:30:44] <easyOnMe> please anyone can explain to me
[04:30:57] <easyOnMe> my knowledge of jquery is about beginner's level only
[04:34:44] <easyOnMe> <momomo>: hi
[04:34:50] <easyOnMe> can you help me
[04:35:09] <easyOnMe> <banandana>: hi
[04:35:14] <easyOnMe> mind if I ask for help
[04:35:26] <arc_> can you not highlight random people
[04:35:48] <easyOnMe> arc_: just trying my luck for help
[04:35:52] <easyOnMe> I have been waiting
[04:36:00] <easyOnMe> for quite sometime already
[04:36:16] <arc_> your out: function is fading it out
[04:36:37] <arc_> that's what i said last night
[04:36:51] <easyOnMe> arc_: No I never heard anything from you last night
[04:37:32] <arc_> [01:20:21] <arc_> well, when you drag out, you are removing it
[04:37:41] <easyOnMe> I even ask for help how to make the jquery work but I got no reply
[04:38:04] <easyOnMe> arc_: yes of course
[04:38:28] <easyOnMe> but what I mean is when I drag the draggable to each droppable everything works perfectly fine
[04:38:48] <easyOnMe> the issue is if I completed filling in those droppables with at least one draggable
[04:39:01] <easyOnMe> the original draggable to the left gets fadedOut
[04:39:13] <easyOnMe> that is the problem
[04:39:44] <easyOnMe> arc_: do you understand what I mean
[04:39:58] <arc_> well i can't really tell you why it only triggers when you fill both boxes, but if you remove the out: function, it doesn't do what you are describing anymore
[04:40:47] <easyOnMe> arc_: if I remove the out function then it fails to meet the user requirements
[04:41:24] <easyOnMe> besides the out function should only work on the droppable when the draggable is drag out of it AND not against the draggable itself to the left
[04:42:07] <easyOnMe> I mean against the original draggable from the left that is being cloned when dragged
[04:42:35] <easyOnMe> that sort of issue is what I do not figure out after I corrected the code last night of some other issues
[04:46:10] <arc_> easyOnMe drag the draggable below its box, on the outside of the main div, then up into the droppable
[04:46:16] <arc_> then do it again for the second box
[04:46:35] <arc_> now it doesn't disappear
[04:46:50] <arc_> so it must be because you have to drag the draggable through one droppable
[04:47:04] <arc_> which is for some reason triggering the "out" function
[04:47:33] <arc_> so what i would say is to make each of the two .boxes into separate unique ids
[04:47:41] <arc_> so they aren't interacting with each other
[04:50:22] <arc_> nope, i tried that and it didn't fix it
[04:51:45] <arc_> but now, removing stickers by placing them inside .stickers is working
[04:53:57] <arc_> easyOnMe do you understand what i'm saying
[04:55:31] <arc_> out is being triggered even though you have not dropped it
[04:56:20] <arc_> the condition is not filling both boxes, but simply dragging the .sticker outside of one .boxes
[04:57:14] <arc_> so to fix this, you need to select .new and create a separate out function for that
[04:57:35] <arc_> you are adding .new to any .sticker that is dropped into .boxes
[04:57:55] <arc_> so you can use that to distinguish between one that has been dropped into .boxes
[04:58:08] <arc_> and a new one that is coming from .stickers
[05:10:09] <arc_> also, when you use addClass() you don't want to use '.'
[05:10:25] <arc_> because the method wants a class name, you just write the class name
[05:11:41] <arc_> and now all that explanation is off the screen
[05:13:44] <arc_> well easyOnMe hopefully you read what i said and learn from it. this is what i think you want it to do http://jsfiddle.net/uekop32L/11/
[05:30:14] <easyOnMe> arc_: noted and I will have a look at the code
[05:31:09] <arc_> k
[05:31:20] <arc_> do you understand what the problem was
[05:33:23] <easyOnMe> thanks for your time appreciate it so much
[05:33:39] <arc_> you are welcome, but do you understand what the problem was
[05:39:32] <arc_> ok, well i tried
[05:39:33] <arc_> good night
[05:43:48] <easyOnMe> arc_: I looked at the code the only difference is that you include this line of code that only discriminates the class new to get removed when it is drag out of the boxes class
[05:44:55] <easyOnMe> and this sort of prevents the deletion of the original sticker class from getting remove
[05:44:55] <easyOnMe> arc_: if you have a better explanation please do so
[05:45:13] <easyOnMe> sorry for my delayed reply as I was caught up on analyzing the code and the code you gave
[05:46:50] <easyOnMe> arc_: are you still there
[05:54:55] <momomo> easyOnMe, what kind of help are you looking for? what's your qustion?
[05:55:19] <easyOnMe> oh I got is solve already but I just need some refinement though
[05:55:36] <easyOnMe> momomo: http://jsfiddle.net/uekop32L/11/
[05:56:26] <easyOnMe> I just want that each box to the left will only accept one instance of class .sticker
[05:56:51] <easyOnMe> so if I already dropped one to the box it will only revert back
[05:57:17] <easyOnMe> in order words only allow one yellow box for each of the droppable boxes to the left
[05:58:41] <momomo> i am not familiar with this library
[06:00:15] <easyOnMe> oh ok
[06:00:17] <easyOnMe> thanks
[06:26:22] <easyOnMe> <arc_>:are you still around man
[06:42:16] <Shapeshifter> Hi. I've seen people do $(selector).is("*") is a few places. What's this supposed to mean? Checking for existence? E.g. https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/frontend/app/assets/javascripts/spree/frontend/checkout/payment.js.coffee right at the beginning
[07:03:46] <easyOnMe> Shapeshifter: mind if I asked for help
[07:25:13] <rarila> Hello!
[07:25:25] <newbie> hi there
[07:25:57] <Deinos> can I ask someone about velocity.js or animations in general?

[07:27:45] <easyOnMe> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/5/
[07:28:40] <easyOnMe> I just want one draggable to get appended to the each droppable... If there is already an existing draggable on either droppable the draggable will be reverted back instead of getting appended...
[07:29:11] <easyOnMe> Problem is when I run the code and tested it after I dropped one draggable to one of the droppable the draggable cease to be a draggable
[07:36:31] <Deinos> is anyone here?
[07:37:11] <Deinos> i tried using fiddle but it keeps throwing a 500 error , server error, at me

[07:55:03] <Deinos> I need to bother someone with an animation question
[07:56:00] <Deinos> is it possible to pause an infinite animation in velocity.js, add new settings, then continue from that position with said settings?

[09:02:33] <OscarEvertsson> Hello! I have a question regarding the compability with the normal jquery and jquery mobile. To start of with, I’m hosting a wordpress site and tried listening to “swipe” events. It works great, the only problem is that the links on my page stoped working and I get some sort of warning saying “Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.
[09:02:33] <OscarEvertsson> For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.”
[09:03:17] <OscarEvertsson> It should also be added that I use jquery 1.11.3 and mobile-1.4.5
[09:29:20] <Deinos> can someone tell me why the acceleration only increases?
[09:29:21] <Deinos> https://jsfiddle.net/nej7tLwc/
[09:51:14] <FilipNortic> Deinos: cause X is always qite large?
[09:52:31] <Deinos> hm well no
[09:52:36] <Deinos> let me show you the new fiddle
[09:52:45] <Deinos> https://jsfiddle.net/nej7tLwc/2/
[09:53:06] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: mind if I ask for help
[09:53:28] <easyOnMe> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/5/
[09:53:57] <easyOnMe> I want to allow only one draggable to get attached to the droppables to the left
[09:54:10] <Deinos> if the slider value (ui.value) is 0 X is 5000, with every point in value 48 gets distracted from 5000 to a maximum of 4800
[09:54:22] <Deinos> so that theres a minimum rotation speed of 200ms
[09:54:40] <Deinos> well at least in theory
[09:54:56] <Deinos> but if I move the slider back, the speed doesn't decrease
[09:55:06] <Deinos> it actually increases
[09:55:08] <FilipNortic> Deinos: try changing 48 to 480 and see what happends
[09:55:52] <FilipNortic> or 200 atleast
[09:56:19] <easyOnMe> newbie|2: are you still onlne
[09:56:21] <easyOnMe> online
[09:56:27] <newbie|2> yep
[09:56:29] <easyOnMe> newbie|2: did you manage to obtain help
[09:56:52] <newbie|2> well ... Im the one with the velocity problem which I still couldnt solve
[09:56:57] <newbie|2> https://jsfiddle.net/nej7tLwc/2/
[09:57:05] <easyOnMe> newbie|2: oh ok I do not know what that is
[09:57:17] <easyOnMe> so I do not want to confuse you any further
[09:57:25] <easyOnMe> I thought I can lend a hand
[09:58:10] <Deinos> https://jsfiddle.net/nej7tLwc/3/
[09:59:33] <easyOnMe> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/5/
[09:59:42] <easyOnMe> can anyone help me with my problem also
[09:59:48] <easyOnMe> please
[09:59:59] <Deinos> as you can see, even if you stop the rotation by hand with the button, it keeps a different rotation speed
[10:03:08] <Deinos> any idea FilipNortic ?
[10:04:04] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: I get a TypeEroor  in the console when i drag and drop
[10:04:20] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: what error
[10:04:27] <easyOnMe> how can I see that error myself
[10:04:32] <easyOnMe> please tell me what to do
[10:04:38] <easyOnMe> so that I can correct it myself
[10:06:39] <FilipNortic> hasClass() is a boolean you can't use dragable on it
[10:09:03] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok then how will I prevent the draggable from appending itself again into the droppable boxes if those boxes already have one box inside them
[10:09:30] <easyOnMe> each droppable should only have one draggable inside and once this happens the draggable must revert when drop
[10:09:35] <easyOnMe> when dropped
[10:10:27] <FilipNortic> you can use booleans in if statments
[10:12:08] <rarila2> Still need some help: What could be the reason that inp.on("keyup": fnc); fires in my widget but this._on(inp, {"keyup": fnc}) doesn't?
[10:15:03] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok I get your point but any ideas how to implement what I wanted to happen as described earlier
[10:16:01] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/7/
[10:16:18] <FilipNortic> how far of are you from here?
[10:17:12] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: what do you mean
[10:17:42] <easyOnMe> what I wanted is to allow only one draggable to get attached to any droppable
[10:17:43] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: and don't send yourself alerts use console.log or consloe.debug. When js stop working look at the console for errors
[10:17:56] <easyOnMe> ok noted with thakns
[10:17:56] <easyOnMe> thanks
[10:18:13] <easyOnMe> now the jsfiddle you send it did not work as I wanted it to
[10:18:37] <easyOnMe> when you drag the draggable object it reverts back even if the droppable contains nothing in it
[10:19:33] <FilipNortic> just add a class when you attach a dropable
[10:19:44] <FilipNortic> and if it has that class revrt
[10:20:43] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok wait I will get back to you
[10:21:55] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: and you have to check on the element you drop it in to not on the dropable
[10:22:17] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok but how do I implement that then
[10:22:20] <easyOnMe> any ideas
[10:26:20] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: I tried using the hasClass to check whether the droppable has the class already but it draggable reverts back even if the droppable contains nothing
[10:28:07] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic:  if ($(ui.draggable).hasClass("sticker")) <======== This will not work as it checks whether the draggable is of class sticker which it will always would and so even if the droppable contains nothing it will still revert as the if condition will always be true
[10:28:48] <FilipNortic> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/8/
[10:29:02] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: ^^
[10:30:48] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: this almost works
[10:31:13] <easyOnMe> but then if say you took out the draggable out then the droppable becomes empty
[10:31:34] <easyOnMe> if you put the draggable back it will no longer accept as it keeps reverting
[10:32:12] <easyOnMe> the solution you give is almost there but it only works the first round of dropping
[10:32:12] <FilipNortic> then you run remove class on the droppable when you remove the draggable
[10:32:44] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: this should be easy for you to fix
[10:32:56] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok let me figure this out first
[10:33:01] <easyOnMe> I will try it first
[10:34:28] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: one more thing online 18
[10:34:57] <easyOnMe> $(this).addClass("taken"); this keyword refers to the ui object right
[10:35:08] <easyOnMe> and not the droppable div in question
[10:36:56] <FilipNortic> no it append taken to the droppable
[10:37:29] <FilipNortic> it's the droppable you want to know if its "taken"
[10:38:53] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: as an alternitiv you can do $(this).children(".sticker").length>0
[10:39:12] <easyOnMe> ok let me try that
[10:39:13] <easyOnMe> thanks
[10:39:18] <easyOnMe> I will get back to you
[10:42:30] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/14/
[10:42:38] <easyOnMe> I thought it worked already
[10:43:05] <easyOnMe> but then when you try dragging more of sticker into the same droppable the condition seems unable to work
[10:43:33] <easyOnMe> it keeps of accepting
[10:44:46] <FilipNortic> http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/9/
[10:44:54] <FilipNortic> yeah you broke it
[10:47:45] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: thanks man
[10:47:54] <easyOnMe> you the savior of the day
[10:48:04] <easyOnMe> really appreciate your help and learned a lot from you today
[10:49:04] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: yw but this isn't really that advanced keep using console.log and console.debug and look at the elemnts before asking for help and you will get better faster
[10:49:47] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: speaking of the console.debug are you referring to the console in my own browser or from the console of jsfiddle
[10:50:05] <easyOnMe> you know the console in firebug of mozilla is that the console you are referring to
[10:50:33] <FilipNortic> console.debug() is a method and you see the output in the browser console
[10:51:17] <FilipNortic> i put a few in the fiddle in sent you.
[11:04:03] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok
[11:04:04] <easyOnMe> thanks man
[11:05:07] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: man how do you get this level of skill
[11:05:27] <easyOnMe> It took me 10 hours to just even reach that point where I came here begging for help
[11:05:39] <easyOnMe> for you it was just a matter of minutes
[11:06:08] <easyOnMe> I have been using jquery and jqueryUI on and of for three years
[11:06:21] <easyOnMe> and my skill is even nowhere near intermediate level
[11:06:56] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: I have difficulty understanding how things work with jquery
[11:07:41] <easyOnMe> I am able to successfully use and implement some of jquery and jqueryUI's functionalities but I had tremendous difficulty debugging my work
[11:08:01] <easyOnMe> any suggestions as to how I can hone my skills
[11:09:01] <FilipNortic> easyOnMe: yeah like a told you alert() is not a good the bugger
[11:09:26] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok other than using console any other tips
[11:12:59] <FilipNortic> other then that $(this).length almost always will be 1, no
[11:14:00] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: are you asking me a question
[11:15:27] <FilipNortic> no in this version of your fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/5/ you had the line : if($(this).length>1)
[11:16:05] <FilipNortic> or maybr it was length>0
[11:17:09] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: no I was still experimenting that idea
[11:17:24] <easyOnMe> since I had a very fuzzy understanding of things that idea never worked
[11:17:33] <easyOnMe> I spent 2 hours in that idea
[11:18:11] <easyOnMe> so when you gave me your own implementation the understanding was easier since I spend another of other ideas I had
[11:18:32] <easyOnMe> maybe I need more exposure and experience using jquery and jqueryUI
[11:18:40] <easyOnMe> but I am loving this man
[11:18:56] <easyOnMe> one more thing though
[11:20:24] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: I got some bug
[11:20:39] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/9/
[11:20:46] <easyOnMe> everything was working as expected
[11:20:52] <easyOnMe> but when I tried playing around with it
[11:21:28] <easyOnMe> sometimes after you drag out of the droppable instead of fading out it creates another copy of itself and sticks to the outside area
[11:21:39] <easyOnMe> this one had me courious
[11:21:48] <easyOnMe> what could be the reason to this
[11:25:02] <FilipNortic> yeah i saw some wierd stuff happen before there aswell some times it fades out the elemnt but dosent remove it and stuff like that. but no I've got no leads
[11:25:40] <easyOnMe> I tried using the console.debug but it does not seem to generate any leads either
[11:29:31] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: how can I find any leads then
[11:29:38] <easyOnMe> just give me some where to start
[11:29:42] <easyOnMe> I want to solve this issue
[11:29:45] <easyOnMe> thanks in advanc
[11:29:48] <easyOnMe> advance
[11:32:18] <FilipNortic> i would guess that when you move them between boxes the order when (append clone) and the fadeout remove triggers isn't isn't fixed
[11:32:52] <FilipNortic> no clue how to make that work correctly though
[11:44:58] <easyOnMe> FilipNortic: ok thanks
[11:45:04] <easyOnMe> at least I got something to start with
[11:58:28] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. Is this a valid json structure ? -- http://pastie.org/10628008
[12:02:30] <FilipNortic> http://jsonlint.com/
[12:03:05] <Vivekananda> thanks FilipNortic I was looking for something like that too . had forgotten
[12:04:29] <FilipNortic> if you google json validator it's like the first non ad promoted hit
[12:05:40] <Vivekananda> FilipNortic, yeah I was just doing it. I ran it through there but I cannot very well understand how to change this to get to the correct form. The ending result I need is the form I just pasted on the pastie
[12:09:25] <Vivekananda> nevermind. I think I figured it
[12:09:44] <FilipNortic> yeah you wrapped it backwards
[12:32:58] <Dirkos> I need to make a photo slideshow, any good tips on the sliding? Since when using the fade it sometimes stucks a bit
[13:52:57] <flowerss> from this link, why does new YAxisPoint(5) change the y value, instead of the x? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[14:22:59] <flowerss> ...?
[14:25:23] <shoky> flowerss: because YAxisPoint already binds the x value to 0. in this line  var YAxisPoint = Point.bind(emptyObj, 0/*x*/);
[14:26:45] <flowerss> so then you pass one less argument whenever an argument is bound?
[14:28:23] <shoky> that's what it means to bind an argument. it means you bind it to a specific value. and therefore, you don't pass a value for it when calling the new function
[14:30:25] <shoky> disregarding the "this" binding,  it's as if you did  var YAxisPoint = function(y) { return Point(0, y); }
[14:30:51] <flowerss> ok thanks
[14:32:52] <flowerss> maybe you can help with this, which is why I'm trying to understand it, why must the value be bound, for example if I try to pass item['.key'] it doesn't work.  I don't see the difference though.  line 9 https://github.com/firebase/reactfire/blob/master/examples/todoApp/js/todoAppFirebaseExplicit.js
[14:34:05] <flowerss> specifically: removeItem.bind(null,item['.key']), but I can't do removeItem(item['.key'])
[14:34:31] <shoky> flowerss:  because you need to pass a function there.  and removeItem(item['.key'])  is not a function,  it's the return value of a function call
[14:34:58] <shoky> you don't want to call it right away when the component is rendered. only on a click event
[14:35:04] <flowerss> ah ic, thanks very much
[14:35:09] <shoky> removeItem(item['.key']) means call it right now
[14:35:54] <flowerss> fascinating
[14:36:47] <shoky> another way would have been:  onClick={ function() { _this.props.removeItem(item['.key']); } }
[14:36:53] <shoky> does the same thing
[14:37:14] <shoky> (at least i'm assuming that works in jsx, not too experienced with it myself)
[15:03:34] <nerium> Any one know a mobile framework similuar to jquery mobile?
[15:55:34] <Guest3461> https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/key-concepts/ here it says about Ajax and Firebug. It refers to Chrome, shouldnt it be firefox? just sayin in case it helps
[16:50:33] <williamtdr> Hi all! If I have a div attached with absolute positioning to the right side of the page, and I want to ease it over to the left where it is then attached there, is there a way I can do that with animate?
[17:42:39] <game0> guys, I'm trying to read json response from jquery
[17:42:50] <game0> and the problem is in my code
[17:43:02] <game0> can someone help me with that
[17:43:12] <game0> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8060d4f0266a12d0a028
[17:44:00] <game0> and my json response is this
[17:45:01] <game0> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b4b8b193f70c315a3dcf
[17:45:39] <shoky> williamtdr: you can do something like   div.css('left', div.offset().left).animate({left: 0})
[17:45:46] <game0> the problem is that the browser is giving me error and I tried the json code with json formatter and it's show me ok
[17:47:00] <shoky> game0: is it a cross-origin request?  what error are you getting?   don't use async: false.
[17:47:37] <game0> yes, the server is using cors and I'm trying to connect to it
[17:48:20] <shoky> if the server has cors enabled then don't do  dataType: 'jsonp'
[17:48:23] <game0> the error saying is in "FolderDetails":[ Uncaught syntax error
[17:48:32] <shoky> that's only for when you don't have cors and need to use the jsonp hack
[17:48:48] <shoky> just  uncaught syntax error?
[17:48:51] <shoky> no more info?
[17:49:24] <shoky> anyway don't use dataType: 'jsonp'  if your server doesn't support jsonp
[17:49:30] <game0> now it failed to read the json because cors problem
[17:49:40] <game0> I've change jsonp to json
[17:49:49] <shoky> then your server doesn't have cors enabled properly
[17:49:58] <shoky> if it's the regular cors error
[17:50:39] <shoky> btw the original page is loaded from a server, yes? not from the filesystem
[17:50:53] <game0> shoky, let me get it straight cause I'm new in this, first I have to enable cors on the server
[17:51:02] <game0> if the server send me error
[17:51:17] <shoky> what is the error
[17:51:48] <game0> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8089/alfresco/service/digirepo/content.json?guest=true. (Reason: CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing).
[17:51:59] <game0> that's the error throw firefox
[17:52:32] <shoky> ok. then yeah , the cors header is missing from the server response
[20:07:51] <docmur> Is there a way to prevent firefox or gnome from watching to store my password?  I turned caching off.
[20:21:29] <Woet> docmur: ..?
[20:23:04] <docmur> Wow ya let me rephrase:  Is it possible to use jQuery or Pure JavaScript to tell Firefox or Chrome to NOT ask me to store my password?  I'm running into an issue with Firefox where if it stores the password to my login on my web system, it won't validate
[20:24:29] <Woet> docmur: no, that's up to the user.
[20:24:36] <Woet> docmur: fix your web system.
[20:25:12] <rarila> Hello! What could be the reason that inp.on("keyup": fnc); fires in my widget but this._on(inp, {"keyup": fnc}) doesn't?
[20:25:15] <docmur> It's not my system, it's a firefox issue, we don't see this on any other browser
[20:25:25] <docmur> I've already submitted a ticket
[20:25:35] <Woet> docmur: of course it's an issue with your system
[20:26:13] <Woet> docmur: put your test case on www.jsfiddle.net or link the live site
[20:34:57] <leftover> hey guys, can someone explain the second answer in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23985322/react-and-multiple-form-fields
[20:35:26] <leftover> i don't understand the logic behind handleChange function(key) { return function(e) {
[20:35:32] <leftover> like.. how does e get passed ...
[20:36:34] <leftover> i really don't understand how the two functions get nested, and that e gets passed to nested one..
[20:39:11] <docmur> You would have to keep the jsfiddle open for days and still have it link back my server side, doesn't really matter, if I can't stop it, then I'll just have to tell users to NOT store the password or block Firefox
[20:56:34] <wa5ted> its good to be back
[22:14:44] <pizzapie> hey guys, can someone clarify this, if I have a higher order function and pass it two parameters, the second one drops to the nested function automatically if each function has only one parameter?
[23:32:38] <easyOnMe> good morning everyone
[23:32:44] <easyOnMe> I mean good day
[23:33:11] <easyOnMe> morning arc_
[23:33:43] <easyOnMe> I made progress on the work last night
[23:33:53] <easyOnMe> its just that I have two weird stuff happening
[23:34:30] <easyOnMe> firstly, when I count the blocks when it invokes the out function is doubles the deduction
[23:34:42] <easyOnMe> would you mind taking a lot at the code arc_
[23:35:19] <easyOnMe> <arc_>:http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/15/
[23:35:42] <easyOnMe> anyone can also take a look at the code and please provide feedback
[23:37:38] <arc_> easyOnMe it's the same thing again. this is why i was trying to ask you if you understood what the problem was yesterday
[23:37:54] <easyOnMe> arc_: no arc
[23:38:01] <arc_> just listen
[23:38:04] <arc_> place a sticker in the lower left box
[23:38:07] <easyOnMe> the problem yesterday is solve already
[23:38:18] <arc_> then drag it out of the box, making sure that you don't touch any other box
[23:38:19] <easyOnMe> ok continue
[23:38:26] <arc_> now it will only subtract by one
[23:38:43] <easyOnMe> yes yes you are absolutely true
[23:38:58] <arc_> so it's because out doesn't fire only once per drag
[23:39:26] <easyOnMe> the problem is when the out is invoke and it touches the other boxes it gets invoke many time over depending on how many boxes it touches
[23:39:29] <easyOnMe> correct
[23:39:41] <easyOnMe> this is the problem now that I wanted to correct
[23:39:44] <easyOnMe> any ideas
[23:40:27] <arc_> you don't want users to be able to place multiple stickers in one box, correct
[23:40:43] <easyOnMe> arc_: correct
[23:40:58] <arc_> so why don't you just set count to $(new).length; instead of trying to count them
[23:41:16] <arc_> sorry
[23:41:21] <arc_> $('.new').length;
[23:41:26] <arc_> been a long day
[23:41:39] <easyOnMe> arc_: man we're cool here
[23:41:42] <easyOnMe> mistakes happen
[23:41:56] <easyOnMe> ok let me check whether my understanding of you suggestion is correct
[23:42:27] <easyOnMe> if I use $('.new').length does it mean it will only count all the .new classes in current existence
[23:42:37] <arc_> yes
[23:43:19] <easyOnMe> ok, so this means that gets invoke twice, once in the appending part and the other in the removing part
[23:43:41] <easyOnMe> $('.new').length <===== I mean this gets invoke twie
[23:43:43] <easyOnMe> sorry man
[23:43:48] <easyOnMe> twice
[23:43:54] <arc_> you would use it anytime you want to update the number of stickers that exist
[23:44:03] <arc_> so yes that would be when you add one or remove one
[23:44:04] <easyOnMe> ok cool
[23:44:10] <easyOnMe> thanks
[23:44:22] <easyOnMe> let me update the code again and check it
[23:46:41] <easyOnMe> arc_: sorry man it does not work as expected
[23:46:52] <easyOnMe> arc_: http://jsfiddle.net/fnxddmh0/16/
[23:47:22] <arc_> the point was to set the variable 'count' to that value
[23:47:33] <arc_> instead of using it as an iterator
[23:48:33] <easyOnMe> arc_: ok
[23:48:37] <easyOnMe> one min
[23:50:26] <easyOnMe> arc_: it does not update the removal part properly
[23:50:50] <arc_> it does, but where you have your console.debug, it's outputting before the fadeout has finished, and therefore before the item has been removed
[23:51:16] <arc_> if you then type console.debug(count); directly into the console log, it will show the correct value
[23:52:01] <easyOnMe> arc_: so you mean I use console.log instead of console.debug
[23:52:41] <arc_> i honestly don't even know what the difference between those is. the point is that the value is updating, but you are outputting it before it updates
[23:53:48] <easyOnMe> arc_: arc the removal part I place the console right after the removal of the object
[23:53:53] <easyOnMe> please check again
[23:54:14] <easyOnMe> you mean the console.log placed outside the if block is it
[23:55:05] <arc_> you can type that line directly into the console itself, to check the current value
[23:55:27] <arc_> there is nowhere in this current script where you can place that line and it will give the correct value, unless you create a new event or something
[23:55:42] <arc_> but it's just for debugging purposes anyway
[23:56:55] <easyOnMe> arc_: I did type console.log(count) and it says undefine
[23:59:03] <arc_> k .. i guess that's a jsfiddle thing
[23:59:36] <arc_> variable only exists while the script is running, because of some weird scope nonsense
[23:59:53] <easyOnMe> arc_: what do you think if I flag this drop and out and depending on the flag update the count using count as a global variable
