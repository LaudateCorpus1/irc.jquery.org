[01:00:13] <Guest53589> Hi, is it possible to raise performance related bugs in jquery..
[01:01:27] <Guest53589> like, if some code is changed, then if it runs 10X times faster, then shall we open a bug .
[04:52:44] <Duikb00t> hi
[04:53:59] <Duikb00t> I have a AJAX handler with a success handler for a jQuery UI Autocomplete. I know it has a select: method to grab the 'selected' value. now I need not the selected value but the selected element.
[04:54:23] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/T1NnY  see line (30)
[04:57:18] <Cork> Duikb00t: use ui.item
[04:57:26] <Cork> it is the second argument to the select function
[04:57:40] <Duikb00t> :D                 console.log(ui.item);
[04:57:43] <Duikb00t> I was just trying that ;p
[04:58:24] <Duikb00t> But that generates the 'vull returned value from the success handler.
[04:58:25] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/5qEE6
[04:59:00] <Duikb00t> Would be great if I could access: console.log(ui.item.city);
[04:59:12] <Cork> ah... you mangle the source in the source method
[04:59:21] <Cork> so you can't access it in select cause it doesn't exist
[04:59:31] <Duikb00t> indeeeed
[04:59:31] <Cork> use _render and leave the original object intact
[04:59:34] <Duikb00t> oh
[04:59:48] <Duikb00t> Because I have to autocomplete a webform based on the el.city el.zipcode el.name ....
[05:00:02] <Duikb00t> I have to pass those values into a textfield ( that's the end point ) just fyi :)
[05:00:03] <Cork> ya, that is what _render is there to do
[05:00:22] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[05:00:31] <Duikb00t> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[05:00:34] <Duikb00t> ola to fast
[05:00:35] <Duikb00t> thx
[05:01:03] <Duikb00t> I can just be added in the autocomplete handler oO :D nice
[05:01:48] <Cork> it depends on what version of jquery you're using
[05:01:54] <Duikb00t> 3
[05:01:58] <Cork> older versions require you to use .data('autocomplete')
[05:02:36] <Cork> .data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem = function( to be precise
[05:02:47] <Duikb00t> Seems it's not yet going into: _renderItem: function( ul, item ) {
[05:02:48] <Duikb00t> 1 second
[05:02:54] <Duikb00t> Double checking jquery version
[05:03:03] <Cork> it is ui version not jquery core
[05:03:11] <Duikb00t> * jQuery JavaScript Library v3.1.1
[05:03:16] <Duikb00t> oh ok
[05:03:31] <Duikb00t> I am using jquery-ui with only the autocomplete option checked. In the configurator.
[05:03:45] <Cork> doesn't matter the version does though
[05:04:17] <Cork> but you can try .autocomplete().data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem = function(ui, item) {};
[05:04:21] <Duikb00t> :  /*! jQuery UI - v1.12.1 - 2017-02-14
[05:05:00] <Duikb00t> uhhh
[05:05:27] <Duikb00t> I don't see it yet in that kind of syntax :p
[05:06:10] <Duikb00t> hmm Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined  almost
[05:06:45] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/yzd8h  blah shows up but data throws an error. http://kopy.io/yzd8h
[05:07:27] <Cork> Duikb00t: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[05:07:47] <Cork> that should work on a fairly modern version of jquery ui
[05:08:32] <Cork> (haven't tried with autocomplete("instance") my self but it should work)
[05:08:34] <Duikb00t> yeah I was checking some google sites and indeed with my version: 'ui-autocomplete' should work.
[05:08:55] <Cork> ya, but notice that it doesn't send it as an object to the initiator
[05:09:06] <Cork> that matters a lot
[05:10:05] <Duikb00t> hmm
[05:10:09] <Duikb00t> hmm !!! :D
[05:13:30] <Duikb00t> A level deeper: '   return this._renderItem(t, e).data("ui-autocomplete-item", e);'
[05:13:34] <Duikb00t> is where the error occurs.
[05:13:56] <Cork> uh
[05:14:05] <Cork> what are you talking about?
[05:14:15] <Cork> just define the function correctly and it will work just fine
[05:14:25] <Duikb00t> Im talking about the .data
[05:14:33] <Cork> what data?
[05:15:29] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/siluc
[05:15:31] <Duikb00t> that data
[05:24:54] <mar77i> hmm. I think I got closer to this fadeIn/fadeOut problem of mine.
[05:25:02] <Cork> Duikb00t: ya, cause your modifying the object structure
[05:25:13] <Duikb00t> uuuhh
[05:25:16] <mar77i> is there a simple way to loop over all children recursively?
[05:25:23] <Cork> Duikb00t: and the _renderItem doesn't generate the dom structure autocomplete depends on
[05:25:43] <Cork> mar77i: first level children or grand children?
[05:26:00] <Duikb00t> Cork:  true when I use ul from the docs I got no errors
[05:26:02] <Duikb00t> but no results
[05:26:15] <Cork> Duikb00t: ya, as you have to add them in the function :)
[05:26:22] <Duikb00t> ye
[05:26:26] <Duikb00t> did that
[05:26:31] <Duikb00t> but then nothing shows up :D
[05:26:31] <Duikb00t> haha
[05:26:36] <Cork> _renderItem hooks into very deep in the autocomplete structure
[05:26:43] <Duikb00t> oh
[05:26:46] <Duikb00t> but but but
[05:26:49] <Cork> the structure required is quite explicit
[05:27:28] <Duikb00t> But at least I should be able to grab some properties with the values
[05:27:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: renderItem is suppose to return an li object and not a ul btw
[05:27:53] <Cork> Duikb00t: not as long as you replace the object in source
[05:28:03] <mar77i> Cork: all of them.
[05:28:13] <Cork> mar77i: of what -_-'
[05:28:21] <Cork> children or grandchildren
[05:28:40] <Cork> Duikb00t: source should return an array of objects
[05:29:02] <Duikb00t> hm
[05:29:02] <Duikb00t> ok
[05:29:02] <Cork> so just do response(data)
[05:29:23] <Cork> and then in the _renderItem function do ui.item.city or the like
[05:29:41] <Cork> and add that to a newly created $('<li>') object
[05:30:06] <Cork> and append it to the ul that is the first argument given to the function
[05:30:23] <Cork> (and return the element)
[05:30:39] <Cork> Duikb00t: as the example shows here http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[05:31:10] <Duikb00t> Ok I understand so far what should happen,...
[05:31:13] <Duikb00t> response.data
[05:31:19] <Duikb00t> in the        source: function( request, response ) { ?
[05:31:20] <Duikb00t> one
[05:31:37] <Cork> no not response.data
[05:31:40] <Cork> response(data)
[05:31:56] <Cork> data is what you got from the ajax call
[05:32:04] <Cork> and response is how you give it to autocomplete
[05:33:02] <mar77i> Cork: sorry was somewhere else. all of the children and grandchildren :)
[05:33:15] <Cork> mar77i: .find('*')
[05:33:43] <Cork> though you probably want to use a class filter or something like that
[05:33:47] <mar77i> does that also include text nodes or only elements?
[05:33:48] <Cork> or you will match A LOT
[05:33:51] <Cork> no
[05:34:07] <Cork> text nodes aren't elements so the dom doesn't help you select them (it actively hides them)
[05:34:16] <mar77i> good.
[05:34:41] <Cork> well depends on what you want to do, it can be quite annoying too :D
[05:34:47] <mar77i> hmm, the tree isn't lage at that point, but it turns out to be important for compatibility.
[05:34:50] <Duikb00t> olala
[05:37:13] <mar77i> my jquery doesn't seem up to my programming needs, so $('.thingy').find("*") is the same as $('.thingy *'), right?
[05:37:14] <Duikb00t> omg c0rk it's hard to fix
[05:37:28] <Cork> kinda yes
[05:37:47] <Cork> it is a bit more performant, as the browser doesn't have to traverse the entire dom to find the elements
[05:38:04] <Cork> (css selectors work from the right to the left, not left to right)
[05:38:11] <mar77i> Cork: wait, which one?
[05:38:15] <Cork> the former
[05:38:32] <Cork> $('.thingy') finds all elements with the thingy class
[05:38:45] <Cork> and then .find('*') finds all child elements of those
[05:38:54] <mar77i> of course.
[05:39:07] <Cork> $('.thingy *') finds all elements and then filters out those that don't have a .thingy parent
[05:39:50] <mar77i> hmm. how do I add the ancestor there, too?
[05:39:50] <Cork> (by walking from the target element up the parent tree and checks for the class)
[05:40:03] <Cork> ancestor?
[05:40:17] <Cork> you mean you want to check for a middle element?
[05:40:29] <Cork> $('.thingy .other *')
[05:40:40] <Cork> or $('.thingy').find('.other *'=
[05:40:42] <Cork> *)
[05:41:10] <mar77i> ... var x = $('.thingy'); x.splice(x.length, 0, x.find("*"))
[05:41:23] <Cork> O_o
[05:41:27] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[05:41:56] <Cork> ah
[05:42:06] <Cork> x = $('.thingy
[05:42:12] <Cork> butter finger...
[05:42:17] <mar77i> I want $(".thingy") U $('.thingy').find("*")
[05:42:28] <Cork> x = $('.thingy'); x = x.add(x.find('*'))
[05:42:44] <mar77i> seems okay, thanks :)
[05:43:02] <Cork> $('.thingy').find('*').addBack() might work too
[05:43:08] <Cork> (i think it does)
[05:44:30] <mar77i> wow
[05:53:41] <mar77i> something's broken. so this browser wants to make me believe it doesn't know about "Math".
[07:06:19] <user132109128309> http://jsfiddle.net/c9modp0r/3/ trying to run through each link and apply the link from the top to each under h2 any ideas? only one link coming through
[07:20:58] <Cork> user132109128309: you need to use $(this).nextAll('h2').first()
[07:21:14] <Cork> user132109128309: the current solution will modify all h2 tags every time
[07:23:05] <user132109128309> Leg end! thanks so much
[07:23:09] <user132109128309> works a treat :)
[07:59:19] <user132109128309> Hey cork any ideas in this one http://jsfiddle.net/c9modp0r/14/
[07:59:29] <user132109128309> I cant get it to go around the div?
[07:59:36] <user132109128309> with .next
[08:00:43] <Cork> ya, like i said you need to use nextAll(
[08:00:49] <Cork> *ya, like i said you need to use nextAll().first()
[08:00:52] <Alina-malina> I am trying to add text to child of a <li id='myuniqueID'><div class="someclass">here</div> how vcan i do this?
[08:01:20] <Cork> Alina-malina: make a jsfiddle of the problem you're trying to solve
[08:02:01] <Cork> user132109128309: also $(this, 'div') isn't doing anything of value so you can just as well do $(this)
[08:02:26] <Cork> (specifically it selects this that is a child of a div...)
[08:03:11] <Uhku> Alina-malina: $('#myuniqueID > .someclass').text('here');
[08:04:43] <Alina-malina> let me try Uhku
[08:05:04] <Cork> it will replace the text in the div though
[08:05:26] <Cork> (and was one of the reason i asked for a jsfiddle)
[08:07:16] <user132109128309> http://jsfiddle.net/c9modp0r/14/
[08:09:26] <Alina-malina> ah it worked thank you so much Uk
[08:09:33] <Alina-malina> Uhku^
[08:09:47] <Alina-malina> i did not know about the '>' operator
[08:09:49] <Alina-malina> very convenient
[08:10:46] <Cork> Alina-malina: > just means only select direct children
[08:10:56] <Alina-malina> yes heh, today i learn something new
[08:10:58] <Cork> if the depth doesn't matter you don't need it
[08:10:59] <Alina-malina> thanks everyone
[08:11:04] <Alina-malina> no it doesnt
[08:11:28] <Cork> (and you're better of leaving it out in those cases as it is slower)
[08:12:21] <sillyslux_> does > really slow it down? i'd expect it to be faster
[08:12:41] <Cork> sillyslux_: the browser needs to do a more complect check for parents
[08:12:45] <Cork> so yes it is slower
[08:13:26] <sillyslux_> and what if there are very many and very deep children, but only a few direct ones?
[08:13:39] <MikeD_> ">" ?  are you talking about the difference between .children() and .find() ?
[08:13:51] <Cork> sillyslux_: each one of those elements would have to check if the direct parent is the matching one
[08:13:58] <Cork> sillyslux_: so again it would be slower
[08:14:03] <Alina-malina> Cork, make it slower? heh then what is the solution then for not slow one?
[08:14:23] <Cork> Alina-malina: unless you explicitly need to only match direct child
[08:14:34] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[08:14:39] <Cork> $('#myuniqueID .someclass').text('here');
[08:15:00] <Cork> that will match the .someclass and check if it has a parent #myuniqueid
[08:15:30] <Cork> MikeD_: i'm talking about how selector matching works in the browser
[08:16:02] <Cork> and no $().children() isn't using selector so it is always as fast as it gets (even faster then ids)
[08:16:48] <Cork> also worth mentioning, the performance difference is very small
[08:17:02] <Cork> but when it adds up with a lot of selectors it can make a real difference
[08:17:36] <Cork> (so the comment is more so this is known, not so much cause "oooh that will give you horrible performance")
[08:18:22] <Alina-malina> Cork, thanks that work great
[08:23:29] <MikeD_> $('#myuniqueID .someclass').text('here');  really gets all the .someclass and checks for the parent?!?  that seems crazy
[08:24:22] <MikeD_> i would have assumed that would get #myuniqueID first, then .find() the .someclass elements from the tree below #myuniqueID
[08:24:29] <slax0r> no, te selector gets only those '.someclass' elements that are under #myuniqueID
[08:25:07] <MikeD_> $('#myuniqueID .someclass').text('here') vs $('#myuniqueI').find('.someclass').text('here')  ?
[08:32:39] <dglambert> morning
[08:33:38] <Miyagii> Guys someone got a minute? I've got problem with my slider :(
[08:34:47] <dni-> whats the problem ;)?

[08:36:58] <Miyagii> when i click on it it is sometimes showing two images
[08:37:21] <dni-> wow
[08:37:28] <dni-> why you dont use a nice slider plugin?
[08:37:47] <dni-> http://bxslider.com/ for example
[08:38:30] <Miyagii> dni-: because i want to learn how to do it myself :D im a newbie, one month in webdev
[08:38:41] <dni-> look at the source code ;D
[08:38:54] <dni-> this if looks dubios
[08:38:55] <dni-> if (numer -1 == 1) {
[08:39:01] <dni-> not sure what you want to achieve
[08:39:02] <dni-> ^^
[08:39:19] <Miyagii> when i click left arrow
[08:39:25] <Miyagii> it should go back to previous slide

[08:40:01] <dni-> you could do this with jquery
[08:41:03] <Miyagii> dni-: give me some advice how :)
[08:43:12] <dni-> mom
[08:43:58] <yuka> I have a string with www.url.com/alias/#myhash, in my code I do something simple like: window.location.hash=""; this removes the myhash, but browser is leaving the # symbol. is there a way to remove that from url address bar of browser?

[08:49:19] <dni-> something like this
[09:24:25] <verax5> yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[10:17:09] <realies> can you hook click events to items that don't exist yet?
[10:17:26] <realies> e.g. something that you wont have to re-load every time you dynamically create an object
[10:26:17] <graingert> realies: yes with event delegation
[10:26:41] <graingert> realies: but it's best to create the event handlers as you create the elements
[10:27:03] <graingert> realies: if you use something like react it will setup the handlers for you
[10:27:37] <realies> graingert, just read about .live()
[10:28:14] <realies> which apparently is old
[10:28:48] <realies> replaced with .on?

[11:22:25] <D437> Hello?
[11:23:15] <D437> http://pastebin.com/aLpyNptu
[11:23:38] <D437> Could someone help me writing a function that is triggered by an onSelect event?
[11:23:48] <D437> I'm very very new to jquery
[11:24:45] <IhrFussel> I'm using jquery on my website and it worked flawlessly until I updated my browser...can anybody confirm the JS loads correctly in their browser?? I get 2 errors "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ] jq.js 1" and "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined (index):67" ... the link is http://bit.do/ihrfussel
[11:25:18] <D437> So, I have a datepicker and based on what time the user chooses, I have to populate a dropdown box based on that time
[11:25:51] <IhrFussel> jq.js is the jquery file*
[11:27:30] <IhrFussel> When I look at the Jquery file in the development console everything is gibberish...wrong encoding???
[11:27:50] <D437> Hellooo? Anyone at all?
[11:28:01] <hlve> Hi!
[11:29:06] <hlve> IhrFussel, $ is not defined means jQuery hasn't loaded yet.
[11:29:42] <IhrFussel> hlve, but it worked before I updated my browser....the development console says the 10 first chars of jq.js are "]�����"
[11:29:55] <hlve> looks broken.
[11:30:15] <hlve> I'm not touching your link with a ten foot pole. Sorry.
[11:30:22] <D437> Can anyone help me write a function that is triggered by an onSelect event? I have a datepicker and a dropdown box with times in it. Based on the date picked, I want to limit the times displayed
[11:30:32] <hlve> D437, ask again, maybe other people will hear you a 3rd time
[11:30:44] <D437> http://pastebin.com/aLpyNptu
[11:31:11] <hlve> Create a jsfiddle with your code, D437
[11:32:28] <IhrFussel> hlve, http://imgur.com/e5ZqZlsl.png
[11:33:04] <hlve> why not output jq.js into a pastebin or fiddle?
[11:33:27] <hlve> the characters you said were there aren't telling me anything besides "the file looks corrupt"
[11:33:59] <IhrFussel> I'm not stupid, I'm a server admin and know that "cat jq.js" displays everything correctly
[11:34:48] <D437> https://jsfiddle.net/eznbssfy/
[11:35:14] <D437> I can't get the datepicker to load here, I don't know why
[11:35:19] <IhrFussel> And since it displayed fine before update everything points to Opera 43 being the issue
[11:36:00] <hlve> So check the Opera 43 changelog and see if there are any known issues with JS not rendering correctly
[11:36:03] <hlve> o_O
[11:36:25] <hlve> I didn't call you stupid. I simply pointed out a "This looks like X"
[11:36:31] <user132109128309> Trying to wrap a link around each heading and using the href from each image any ideas how I could do this? http://jsfiddle.net/c9modp0r/24/
[11:37:05] <hlve> D437, you didn't call the datepicker plugin as an external resource
[11:38:30] <D437> hlve: I have no idea what that means! I'm sorry! Should I include the <script> files in the head?
[11:39:00] <hlve> idk which datepicker plugin you're using lol
[11:39:28] <hlve> To get the datepicker to show up, you're using a jQuery plugin on your end.
[11:39:41] <hlve> You need to reference that file on jsfiddle to have it show up.
[11:40:05] <D437> The one that comes by default with jquery: https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[11:40:12] <hlve> that's jqueryui
[11:40:16] <hlve> not the same thing.

[11:45:17] <skypce> hi all
[11:45:43] <skypce> how can i use function of var inside document ready, please see my code: http://pastebin.com/K2mJjXmC
[11:46:18] <D437> ok, I got it
[11:46:19] <skypce> i need use global vars of function sizing  inside of document ready
[11:46:25] <D437> hlve: Here you go http://jsfiddle.net/8w8v9/2760/
[11:47:07] <hlve> @ D437  http://jsfiddle.net/8w8v9/2761/ ?

[11:50:33] <user132109128309> Trying to wrap a link around each heading and using the href from each image any ideas how I could do this? http://jsfiddle.net/c9modp0r/24/
[12:11:03] <user132109128309> anyone got any ideas?
[12:42:45] <taplar> user132109128309: can you state what you are trying to do again?
[12:43:08] <user132109128309> sure
[12:43:38] <user132109128309> Im trying to loop through all the links that are attached to each element so say 4 links for 4 images
[12:43:52] <user132109128309> I then want to add each of those links to each header underneath the images
[12:44:16] <user132109128309> i juts cant seem to join it all up to connect or communicate with one another
[12:44:20] <user132109128309> and need a bit of help
[12:44:27] <user132109128309> does that make sense?
[12:45:00] <user132109128309> http://jsfiddle.net/c9modp0r/24/
[12:46:20] <taplar> add or move the link under the header?
[12:48:19] <user132109128309> add
[12:48:27] <user132109128309> i need to add it to the h2
[12:48:47] <taplar> ok, so first, it looks like you are able to loop over each of the links, right?
[12:49:15] <user132109128309> right
[12:49:45] <taplar> alright, so how would you think you'd go about finding the header you need to add it after?
[12:50:03] <user132109128309> .next() or maybe .find()
[12:50:22] <user132109128309> or .nextAll()
[12:50:22] <taplar> in the context of the dom, how are the two related?
[12:50:42] <user132109128309> ok any chance of an amended fiddle?
[12:50:50] <duch_kazatel> user132109128309 he's helping you learn :)
[12:50:53] <taplar> i haven't changed anything.
[12:51:09] <user132109128309> I know... can you?
[12:51:18] <duch_kazatel> user132109128309 that's now how we work here :)
[12:51:23] <duch_kazatel> *not
[12:51:52] <user132109128309> ok
[12:52:06] <taplar> so think of a normal page.  take the body and head tags.  how are they related?
[12:53:04] <user132109128309> sorry i havent got time
[12:53:12] <taplar> ah, ok.  gl then
[12:53:17] <user132109128309> desperate for this and i know im nearly there
[12:53:19] <user132109128309> cheers
[12:53:59] <taplar> fwiw, knowing the relation will point you towards the methods you need to use for the solution
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> aaaand he's already gone.
[12:54:18] <taplar> lovely start to the day, :)
[12:54:21] <laravel7> how to pass args to line 13? http://codepad.org/B5YCvQK7
[12:54:58] <robertmaxrees> it's there already laravel7
[12:55:45] <laravel7> TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'args[2]')
[12:56:23] <robertmaxrees> console.log(args)
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> what is that, right before that line?
[12:58:12] <laravel7> args are defined all 3 elements, call is at line 1, but at line 13 whole args variable is undefined
[12:59:07] <robertmaxrees> so if you console.log(args) right before that line, it's undefined?
[12:59:07] <taplar> is page.open a deferred thing?
[13:02:56] <laravel7> code and output http://codepad.org/BqsYKo7b
[13:07:24] <taplar> not sure if it's relevant, but have you tried system.args instead?  http://phantomjs.org/api/system/property/args.html
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> http://phantomjs.org/api/webpage/method/evaluate.html
[13:08:00] <robertmaxrees> Closures, functions, DOM nodes, etc. will not work!
[13:08:38] <taplar> aaaaaah
[13:11:52] <taplar> that's interesting.  so by it saying closures will not work, you can' even do and IIFE to make the function that will be evaluated to scope the args into it
[13:12:04] <robertmaxrees> exactly what he's tryign to do there.
[13:13:57] <laravel7> var title = page.evaluate(function(i should pass string here, not array?)
[13:14:33] <taplar> look at the second example on that page
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> you cannot define what those args are - those are defined by phantom fwiw
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, check out thje docs
[13:16:33] <laravel7> http://codepad.org/sV7iXf9p
[13:16:50] <robertmaxrees> again
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> you can't define those argws.
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> those are defined by phantom.
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9838119/pass-arguments-with-page-evaluate
[13:17:57] <laravel7> pass it behind the anon function
[13:18:16] <laravel7> yes
[13:19:03] <taplar> you're missing the second argument to the evaluate
[13:19:21] <taplar> which is shown in that SO and in the docs example 2
[13:21:06] * taplar currently watching some dam footage
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:21:17] <robertmaxrees> which footage?
[13:21:33] <taplar> http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-live-updates-oroville-dam-watch-flurry-of-work-underway-to-repair-1487090246-htmlstory.html
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah
[13:22:04] <robertmaxrees> tho the times has gotten a few big things wrong about what's going on.
[13:22:28] <taplar> well, the times, they are a changin
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:22:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm seeing RVs and stuff EVERYWHERE here.
[13:23:24] <IhrFussel> hlve, I just tested it with another .js file and that one loads correctly
[13:23:35] <taplar> hmm, i'm not getting sound from these vids
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> taplar sounds about right.
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> pretty common.,
[13:23:58] <robertmaxrees> not really much to say.
[13:24:06] <robertmaxrees> dude's are dropping bags of rocks into some water.
[13:24:13] <IhrFussel> I checked both files with the file command and they both are "ASCII text"
[13:28:36] <taplar> "repopulation" plan.. yeah baby  *bow chicka wow wow*
[13:28:41] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:28:56] <taplar> that's why they call him "the mayor"
[13:29:15] <taplar> sorry, sherrif
[13:31:34] <sillyslux> oh robertmaxrees, is that somewhere near you?
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux yep.  about 40 minutes from here.
[13:31:49] <robertmaxrees> one of the next towns over.
[13:31:57] <hlve> IhrFussel, I really think one of the JS files got corrupt
[13:32:01] <sillyslux> would you be affected from a breach?
[13:32:04] <hlve> the symbols you pasted weren't ASCII text.
[13:32:11] <sillyslux> or your house?
[13:32:35] <IhrFussel> hlve, no I renamed jq.js in jquery.js and it's fixed
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux not directly.  all that water would go south of oroville and say well away from here.
[13:32:44] <hlve> o_O
[13:32:46] <robertmaxrees> *stay
[13:32:48] <sillyslux> cool
[13:33:04] <hlve> ...O_o. Maybe the cache was busted?
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah. we've dealt with enough water in our house to last us a while hahaha
[13:33:11] <sillyslux> always good if it hits somebody else
[13:33:20] <robertmaxrees> but all the people from that town were told to come here.
[13:33:22] <hlve> what happened at the Oroville Dam?
[13:33:24] <hlve> Shit break?
[13:33:33] <sillyslux> not yet
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> hlve the auxillary spillway started eroding like crazy.
[13:33:38] <sillyslux> and seems as it won't
[13:33:49] <robertmaxrees> water level's dropping, but maybe not fast enough right noiw.
[13:33:53] <hlve> well, stay safe homie
[13:33:54] <IhrFussel> http://imgur.com/fxkxEKyl.png << some sort of cache issue I'm guessing?
[13:33:56] <robertmaxrees> storms later in the week might become a big problem.
[13:34:17] <hlve> IhrFussel, have you tried busting your cache completely and seeing if all is fixed?
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> i've even got coworkers who are staying at evacuee shelters because of it.
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> totally batty
[13:36:23] <IhrFussel> hlve, I admit I didn't delete the cache v ia settings I only tried the "reload without cache" trick
[13:36:45] <robertmaxrees> IhrFussel that has a tendency to not work.
[13:36:53] <robertmaxrees> especially when it's for assets and not the page itself.
[13:37:17] <hlve> ^ ;o
[13:40:04] <IhrFussel> robertmaxrees, hlve I'll remember that for the future...thank you for helping :)
[13:40:26] <hlve> next time don't assume someone is calling you stupid when they suggest something :)
[13:40:48] <hlve> we're all here to help eachother, homie
[13:41:00] <taplar> not me.  fk that
[13:41:36] <hlve> lol
[13:41:37] <taplar> i'm here for the ladies
[13:41:45] <hlve> so many ladies.
[13:44:37] <IhrFussel> hlve, I think I was just a bit upset about the whole situation and overreacted quite a bit...sorry for that
[13:50:07] <hlve> all good dude
[13:57:51] <hlve> is there a good alternative to jqui tabbable?
[14:04:09] <hlve> p_P?
[14:04:31] <robertmaxrees> i got nothing other than suggesting bootstrap
[14:04:41] <robertmaxrees> if you're using it already.
[14:05:08] <hlve> I'm not. trying to get rid of jQUI from our project, and we're only using Slider and Tabable
[14:05:08] <hlve> ;/
[14:05:55] <taplar> i dunno how complex your tab logic is.  there's always the option to build your own with css rules and tricks
[14:05:59] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:06:03] <robertmaxrees> or even just JS.
[14:06:08] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be too hard either way.
[14:09:10] <hlve> preventPdfFocus($(":tabbable").first()[0]);
[14:09:15] <hlve> o_O
[14:25:17] <hlve> nvm. figured it out --
[14:38:04] <MikeD_> why doesn't .text() honor html entities?
[14:38:28] <hlve> because not all html entities are text.
[14:38:41] <MikeD_> such as?
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> anythjing that isn't a textnode?
[14:38:56] <hlve> ^
[14:39:01] <MikeD_> &iques;
[14:39:46] <hlve> checkbox inputs for example.
[14:39:50] <MikeD_> i'm trying to imagine a &foo; token that wouldn't be a "character" - even if it's an ugly square
[14:40:12] <robertmaxrees> they're still entities.
[14:40:43] <hlve> what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[14:40:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/84317oqe/
[14:40:51] <MikeD_> i think i used the wrong word then... what's the name for &foo; encodings of characters?
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> entities
[14:41:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't want the character, you want the entity?
[14:41:44] <robertmaxrees> so instead of >, you want &gt; ?
[14:42:29] <MikeD_> nm, it's &iquest;  (i forgot the t)
[14:42:31] <hlve> use .html for that?
[14:42:32] <robertmaxrees> or do you only want the entity if it's not in some particular set?
[14:43:00] <MikeD_> it's the simplest stuff that i trip over
[14:43:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:44:02] <MikeD_> &bull; and &copy; and &nbsp; and &lt; are all so short, i assumed "inverted question mark" was also as short as possible
[15:51:11] <User__> Hi there I am trying as I may have asked earlier to add a link from around an image and apply it to each h2 there after inside a .each loop could anyone help out at all? http://jsfiddle.net/wemy0x6p/1/
[15:51:54] <robertmaxrees> remember taplar's advice? :)
[15:52:01] <User__> Yes!
[15:52:38] <robertmaxrees> so you want to put the link after the h2.
[15:52:42] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[15:52:46] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to find the current h2?
[15:53:06] <User__> no?
[15:53:17] <User__> Ive tried many ways?
[15:53:22] <User__> lol
[15:53:34] <User__> not from my position of a
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> so .closest() is a GREAT tool here.
[15:53:38] <User__> Ahhh
[15:53:45] <User__> so taht would go up?
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> ah way.
[15:53:48] <User__> that*
[15:53:56] <robertmaxrees> you're alternating between divs and p tags
[15:54:08] <robertmaxrees> any reason you don't have a common wrapper around each combo?
[15:54:21] <User__> How do you mean sorry?
[15:55:04] <User__> The reason this is laid out like this is because the link is coming through from PHP and it wraps the img in a link but also adds in two <p> tags around this
[15:55:12] <robertmaxrees> look at your html - notice how there's that wrapper did #grid, then a p followed by a div followed by a p followed by a div?
[15:55:20] <User__> i need to get the link and then go back to the h22
[15:55:25] <User__> I know
[15:55:41] <User__> I need i be like this I can't get it out any other way
[15:55:41] <robertmaxrees> so why not wrap each "pair" in a shared element?
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> should be trivial to add an extra element around each pair but ok.
[15:56:08] <robertmaxrees> that would make this super easy heh.
[15:56:13] <User__> yeah
[15:56:17] <User__> quite
[15:56:22] <robertmaxrees> err
[15:56:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:56:28] <robertmaxrees> so then you're g2g?
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:57:02] <User__> sorry mate i'm not with you
[15:57:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:57:17] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[15:57:28] <User__> you reckon use .closest?
[15:57:28] <robertmaxrees> you can still use .closest() to grab that parent p tag.
[15:57:39] <User__> Ok makes sense
[15:57:43] <robertmaxrees> then use .next() to get that div that contains the div
[15:57:44] <User__> and then?
[15:57:46] <robertmaxrees> then append to there.
[15:57:52] <User__> Ahh i see
[15:58:10] <User__> ok cheers i'll give it a go
[15:58:26] <robertmaxrees> but fsrs, much with your backend to get those tags on it.
[15:59:10] <User__> I would love to you see it's a custom shortcode where client can just come in an add a simple link on an image
[15:59:28] <User__> It then turns into a blog feed loop
[15:59:37] <robertmaxrees> that should be a relatively simple change.
[15:59:38] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[15:59:39] <User__> and I am having orobs with the h2
[15:59:46] <User__> on hover
[16:02:57] <User__> sorry i'm still confused could you give me a hinter?
[16:04:05] <User__> .closest().next() ?
[16:04:49] <robertmaxrees>  err.
[16:04:59] <User__> gt it!
[16:05:02] <User__> lol
[16:05:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:05:07] <robertmaxrees> just gotta read the docs yo.
[16:05:43] <User__> just sometimes i suppose it feels like you have to bend your own mind to get there?
[16:06:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:06:12] <robertmaxrees> the docs provide tons of examples and good info.
[16:06:18] <User__> suppose
[16:06:20] <User__> thank you!
[16:30:55] <User__> cheers for the help got it in the end all fixed up!
[17:56:51] <dashu> can someone please help me ? i got 3 ajax calls in a a click event. sometimes some dont even get called because of if conditions. is there a way to make sure that a function is called after all 3 ajax calls are completed. i cant work with complete because it is actually one ajax call in a loop and as said there are if conditions.
[17:57:00] <dashu> i am stuck with jquerry 1.8
[17:57:21] <robertmaxrees> sure - show us the code?
[17:57:22] <dashu> and it is legacy code
[17:57:34] <robertmaxrees> and do you need to know if all three finished, or if whatever ones get fired finished?
[17:57:53] <dashu> whatever once get fired finish
[17:57:59] <robertmaxrees> YEAH, CAN DO THAT.
[17:58:03] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:58:04] <dashu> is $.wg
[17:58:07] <dashu> oh
[17:58:16] <robertmaxrees> that's actually really easy.
[17:58:29] <dashu> is $.when(3dasf,lclick),done(function)
[17:58:31] <dashu> a way
[17:58:55] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[17:58:59] <robertmaxrees> except you have a variable number of ajax calls, right?
[17:59:06] <dashu> yep
[17:59:17] <fvox13> in an event handler, when I use e.preventDefault(), how do I then cause the default to happen, i.e. is there an e.resumeDefault() or e.allowDefault() I can call when my event handler is done running?
[17:59:17] <fvox13> probably an elementary question, but I've been using jQ for years and never needed it....
[17:59:26] <robertmaxrees> dashu you'll use $.when.apply($, foo), where foo is an array of the calls.
[17:59:48] <taplar> fvox13: why not only prevent it in the case it should be prevented?
[18:00:12] <robertmaxrees> dashu so basically, you push each one into that array, and then when they're all there you use that $.when dealio.
[18:00:30] <dashu> :o that works ?
[18:00:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:00:59] <robertmaxrees> $.when.apply($, yourArrayHere);
[18:01:06] <dashu> ill try that as soon as im at work again.
[18:01:06] <fvox13> taplar: as an example, I have $(".delete-intercept").submit(function(e), which uses confirm() to ask the user if they want to delete or just deactivate... and dynamically changes a hidden form input's value to "true" or "false".  After that happens, I want to submit the form to the server as normal
[18:01:17] <dashu> thanks alot
[18:01:37] <robertmaxrees> fvox13 you'll need to use .on('submit' and check for extra data you can pass via .trigger()
[18:01:45] <taplar> fvox13: you can call submit() on the dom Element and it will bypass the jQuery handler
[18:02:15] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[18:02:16] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[18:02:42] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor not doing that because it's not immediately apparent to most people what you're doing unless you comment the hell out of it.
[18:04:16] <fvox13> robertmaxrees: taplar:  thanks!
[18:04:50] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Hey man, my while loop in my code is making my system hang for some reason. I'm not sure why :[
[18:04:51] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/7b55f2b7e98fd4b95d34f1c07c801198
[18:04:56] <Darmani> Could you take a look?
[18:06:39] <robertmaxrees> probably because you never meet that condition.
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> because that .fomat() call is returning one format and the .add() call it returning another.
[18:07:21] <robertmaxrees> *is
[18:07:25] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess at least.
[18:08:00] <Darmani> oh shit
[18:08:00] <Darmani> duh
[18:08:09] <Darmani> thanks man I don't know why I didn't notice that
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[18:08:42] <robertmaxrees> could stand to pass around named functions fwiw.
[18:08:52] <robertmaxrees> and abstract out a little.
[18:09:05] <Darmani> how so?
[18:09:26] <robertmaxrees> so basically, you have a bunch of discrete actions, right?
[18:09:34] <Darmani> yeah
[18:09:48] <robertmaxrees> so why not pull them into functions and call them?
[18:09:57] <robertmaxrees> that gives you named things to work with.
[18:10:07] <Darmani> which ones though
[18:10:11] <robertmaxrees> all of them.
[18:10:16] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[18:10:16] <Darmani> oh lol
[18:13:31] <robertmaxrees> wait
[18:13:31] <robertmaxrees> eventDates[new Date(eventDate2)] = new Date(eventDate2);
[18:13:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:13:54] <robertmaxrees> you're creating an object whose keys and values are the same thing?
[18:14:14] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: oh shit I guess that's a bit redundant huh... lol
[18:14:21] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:14:28] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want an array.
[18:14:32] <Darmani> javascript is my second language D:
[18:14:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:14:44] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:15:13] <Darmani> Well it's an array of objects which are essentially "moment" objects
[18:15:22] <robertmaxrees> eventDates[new Date(eventDate2)] = new Date(eventDate2); isn't an array
[18:15:47] <cannap> !=
[18:15:52] <Darmani> eventDates[] is an array isn't it?
[18:15:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:16:01] <robertmaxrees> that's just how you access object properties.
[18:16:07] <Darmani> oh
[18:16:16] <cannap> array of objects
[18:16:18] <cannap> or maybe wrong
[18:16:21] <robertmaxrees> wrong.
[18:16:27] <cannap> :/
[18:16:34] <Darmani> :\
[18:16:39] <robertmaxrees> the square brackets is just how you access objecxt properties.
[18:17:05] <robertmaxrees> arrays have specific rules about property names (they're numbers instead of strings)
[18:17:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the format of the data coming back from that ajax call?
[18:17:52] <Darmani> json
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:17:58] <robertmaxrees> that's obvious.
[18:18:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean and object or an array.
[18:18:08] <Darmani> oh sorry lol
[18:18:10] <robertmaxrees> (is it surrounded by [] or {})
[18:18:38] <Darmani> I believe it's {} but let me double check
[18:18:50] <robertmaxrees> do you have control over that format?
[18:18:53] <cannap> [] <- most array -> object {}
[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:19:09] <cannap> not?
[18:19:16] <cannap> do i miss something
[18:19:17] <robertmaxrees> "most array"?
[18:19:22] <cannap> its array
[18:19:25] <cannap> ^^
[18:19:27] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:19:28] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: It's an array of objects.
[18:19:36] <robertmaxrees> Darmani.  alright. 1 sec.
[18:20:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry, wrestling with a puppy.
[18:20:09] <Darmani> It's an "event" objects with a start_date/end_date
[18:20:11] <Darmani> no worries lol
[18:20:40] <cannap> wait you asked about this yesterday
[18:20:41] <cannap> or
[18:20:52] <cannap> you cant get the dates from jqueryui?
[18:21:35] <Darmani> I asked about a different problem yesterday. Still related to this but that was a different issue.
[18:21:49] <Darmani> cannap: I have the dates. Now I'm trying to compare them and add them to my eventDates array.
[18:21:52] <robertmaxrees> Darmani so basically, you're trying to fill an array with all unavailable dates?
[18:22:30] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to fill up the dates between the start_date of one object and the end_date of that same object.
[18:22:39] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[18:22:44] <Darmani> So in a calendar it will look like all the dates for that Event are blocked out.
[18:22:47] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:22:55] <cannap> he searched a other problem...
[18:22:55] <Darmani> :thumbsup:
[18:22:56] <cannap> lol
[18:22:57] <cannap> xD
[18:23:08] <robertmaxrees> what are you using to display these?
[18:23:12] <Darmani> cannap: How do you even know?? I never spoke to you lol
[18:23:27] <cannap> what
[18:23:35] <taplar> back to the issue?
[18:23:36] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: datepicker
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> Darmani jquery ui's?
[18:23:56] <Darmani> yup yup
[18:24:32] <cannap> flatpickr can do this
[18:24:45] <robertmaxrees> not really a good solution if he's already using a datepicker fwiw.
[18:25:00] <taplar> iirc datepicker had a way to do stuff with date ranges
[18:25:04] <Darmani> seriously -__-
[18:25:04] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[18:25:16] <taplar> you'd have to look at the docs
[18:25:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#min-max
[18:25:27] <robertmaxrees> Darmani you just give it the ranges.
[18:26:01] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: wouldn't it be this one? https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range
[18:26:17] <robertmaxrees> that's for selecting.
[18:26:23] <robertmaxrees> you want to restrict, no?
[18:26:55] <taplar> i was thinking of something else.  i thought there was an isSelectable option or something that you could give a method that should return true or false
[18:26:57] <Darmani> umm... what do you mean by restrict
[18:27:21] <robertmaxrees> Darmani you havge ranges of dates you want to "block" on your calendar.
[18:27:42] <Darmani> yeah, I guess that's "restricting"
[18:27:50] <robertmaxrees> that's what jquery ui calls it.
[18:27:53] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs.
[18:27:57] <robertmaxrees> but you can feet it ranges.
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> instead of what you're trying to do.
[18:28:07] <robertmaxrees> it handles that for you.
[18:28:34] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShowDay <-- this is what i was thinking of i believe
[18:28:34] <Darmani> But... Will it work with my Event objects?
[18:28:49] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the docs?
[18:28:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:28:55] <robertmaxrees> because they show you.
[18:28:59] <Darmani> taplar: That's what I have with my function tap
[18:29:24] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: ehh we'll try it :)
[18:29:30] <taplar> so... what's not working with it?
[18:29:38] <cannap> https://github.com/kylestetz/CLNDR
[18:29:47] <robertmaxrees> taplar he';s getting an infinit loop scenario with his while loop.
[18:29:53] <robertmaxrees> but the entire idea is unnecessary
[18:30:09] <robertmaxrees> canuk
[18:30:16] <robertmaxrees> err woops bad autocomplete
[18:30:20] <robertmaxrees> cannap still nto helpful.
[18:30:23] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/7b55f2b7e98fd4b95d34f1c07c801198
[18:30:28] <robertmaxrees> he doesn't need a full other plugin.
[18:30:40] <robertmaxrees> just needs to reead the docs.  also plenty of SO posts about it.
[18:30:52] <Darmani> I have it setup where the calendar blocks the start and end dates. I need to block the dates in between.
[18:31:04] <robertmaxrees> right,  that's what the restriction stuff doies for you.
[18:31:06] <robertmaxrees> you feed it ranges.
[18:31:07] <Darmani> taplar: Just so you know what Rob is helping me with.
[18:31:19] <taplar> just found your original snipplet
[18:33:41] <taplar> eh, i'm confuzzed.  your beforeShow is always returning true.
[18:33:46] * taplar goes back to banging on his app
[18:33:48] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/7b55f2b7e98fd4b95d34f1c07c801198#file-calendar-js-L25
[18:33:53] <Darmani> like so?
[18:34:00] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the docs?
[18:34:15] <Darmani> taplar: it returns true but only the ones with the Event object get shown in the calendar.
[18:34:33] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Are you talking about this page? https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#min-max
[18:34:38] <Darmani> Or is there something I'm missing
[18:34:40] <robertmaxrees> again
[18:34:42] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:34:53] <robertmaxrees> but also: search google.
[18:35:06] <robertmaxrees> plenty of people have asked this same question: how do i restrict multiple date ranges
[18:35:34] <Darmani> okay okay...
[19:20:23] <Zythyr> Need help. I want to append the value of an attribute of a SVG element. This appending will be done continously (adding points to a path). What is the best memory efficent way to do it? Currenlty I am doing path.attr("d", path.attr("d") + someNewValue);
[19:21:19] <robertmaxrees> is memory a problem for you?
[19:23:13] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees It could be depending on the browser. I am basicallying using mouse position to get x and y coordinate and adding to the position to the path. I think rewriting the path continously will give poor performance, so I am just appending to the path with new coordinates
[19:23:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd give it a shot and profile first.
[19:23:49] <robertmaxrees> just to conmfirm that it's as intense as you think it is.
[19:25:44] <Zythyr> My entire code is not yet built so i can't test perofmance. :(
[19:25:54] <Zythyr> I have another question.
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like premature optimization to me then.
[19:26:11] <Zythyr> hmm good point
[19:28:44] <Zythyr> I have element A with child element B,C,D. I want to create a new element F and move all the child elements to F. How can I do this? Basically I want to go from A >> B,C,D to A >> F >> B,C,D
[19:29:27] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery?
[19:29:48] <robertmaxrees> protip: don't try to work with SVG with jquery
[19:33:25] <tucan> im moving away from jquery ui autocomplete and trying to use magic suggest or similar autocomplete, can someone help me rewrite it
[19:33:52] <robertmaxrees> tucan you can ask questions here and we can help :)_
[19:34:25] <tucan> im not even sure which one to use, i just need something simple
[19:34:44] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you're moving away from the jqui one?
[19:34:46] <tucan> magic suggest had highest rating on a site
[19:35:29] <tucan> well the lib seems too big, im not doing anything else besides autocomplete
[19:35:48] <robertmaxrees> and you're not already using something like bootstrap yeah
[19:35:51] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:36:02] <tucan> im using bootstrap 3
[19:36:33] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead
[19:36:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:40:18] <tucan> oh cool
[19:40:49] <tucan> my current code using jquery ui autocomplete is this https://paste.perldancer.org/2B0SjiHXqzzf3
[19:40:49] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees I am lightly using JQuery. Majority of my code is in Angular. Only when working with DOM e lements, I have to use JQuery.
[19:41:09] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr are you working with SVG in this case as well?
[19:41:33] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees Yes, I am working with SVG. Why is there an issue?
[19:41:47] <tucan> can i get help rewriting that to Typeahead or am i asking a bit too much
[19:42:16] <tucan> i included the scripts, not sure what to do
[19:42:25] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr jquery is a DOM abstraction library - SVG isn't really the same thing.
[19:42:33] <robertmaxrees> the apis are a little different.
[19:42:43] <robertmaxrees> tucan you can work on it while we answer questions.
[19:42:59] <robertmaxrees> tucan not sure what you expect us to do when you say "can i get help rewriting"
[19:43:27] <tucan> it looks very different
[19:43:32] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees I am manually writing all the SVG elements/attributes using createElementNS and setAttributeNS.
[19:43:53] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr then i'd head over to ##javascript :) they can help you with that :D
[19:44:01] <robertmaxrees> tucan it should.
[19:44:07] <robertmaxrees> so how can we help?
[19:44:49] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees The question I have is unreleated to SVG specifically.
[19:45:06] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr not true.
[19:45:09] <robertmaxrees> you want to apply it to SVG.
[19:45:09] <Zythyr> I have element A with child element B,C,D. I want to create a new element F and move all the child elements to F. How can I do this? Basically I want to go from A >> B,C,D to A >> F >> B,C,D
[19:45:14] <robertmaxrees> unless you're backing off that.
[19:45:18] <robertmaxrees> in whjich case, it's easy.
[19:45:28] <robertmaxrees> you can use $() to create new elementrs.
[19:45:53] <Zythyr> Does it matter if iI want to apply it on SVG? I JQuery is working fine using selector to find my SVG parent element.
[19:46:08] <robertmaxrees> it's going to run into problems eventually.
[19:46:12] <robertmaxrees> there are limitations.
[19:46:22] <Zythyr> Yes, I figured out how to create a new element, but how do I grab all the child element of element A and move them to element F?
[19:46:39] <robertmaxrees> in DOM, var $myNewElement = $('<div>'); $myNewElement.append($someOtherThing.children()); $someOtherThing.append($myNewElement);
[19:46:41] <robertmaxrees> somethjing like that.
[19:48:04] <Zythyr> robertmaxrees Thanks. In your example, are we going to have duplicates of the children? One set of children inside someOtherThing and another copy inside myNewElement
[19:49:13] <robertmaxrees> if you read the documentation for .append() at http://api.jquery.com/append/, you'll see it says: "If an element selected this way is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be moved into the target (not cloned):"
[19:49:16] <robertmaxrees> and gives an examplke
[19:49:51] <Zythyr> Ohh great! Thank you for the clarification!
[19:50:04] <Zythyr> Sorry I am overall a noob to Javascript in genereal
[19:50:05] <robertmaxrees> the docs are a great resource.
[19:50:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd also hit learn.jquery.com
[19:50:25] <robertmaxrees> and heed my advice w/r/t jquery and svg.
[19:50:25] <Zythyr> Thank u :)
[19:50:28] <robertmaxrees> you'll thank me later.
[19:50:37] <Zythyr> w/r/t? What is that
[19:50:49] <robertmaxrees> "with regards to"
[19:50:50] <tucan> robertmaxrees: they both use jquery so would $.get gonna be the same with Typeahead?
[19:51:00] <robertmaxrees> tucan yep.
[19:51:03] <robertmaxrees> pretty much
[19:51:22] <tucan> oh hmmm
[19:51:31] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[19:51:58] <Zythyr> I read that JQuery has minimal support for SVG, but if I wam writing the SVG elements manually using createElementNS and setAttributeNS, and only using JQuery as selector, will I still havae issues?
[19:52:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[19:52:29] <robertmaxrees> bnecause now you're doing awkward mixing and matching.
[19:52:34] <robertmaxrees> why use jquery at all in that case?>
[19:54:06] <Zythyr> The reason for JQuery is because I am using AngularJS. For the specific task I am trying to do, ANgularJS uses JQuery Lite.
[19:54:16] <Zythyr> Do you have a suggestion for a libarry to use for SVG stuff?
[19:54:16] <robertmaxrees> for svg
[19:54:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[19:54:23] <robertmaxrees> why not just the DOM
[19:54:32] <robertmaxrees> you're already halfway there.
[19:57:40] <Zythyr> Are you using using DOM functions to select elemements, appened, etc..
[19:58:01] <tucan> robertmaxrees: the 4th solution is for bootstrap3?
[19:58:48] <tucan> can i just put that in my autocomplete.js or do i need .ready()
[19:58:55] <Zythyr> Typo: Are you saying
[20:00:33] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr SVG isn't dom
[20:00:44] <robertmaxrees> tucan no idea without seeing your page
[20:00:48] <robertmaxrees> Zythyr https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG
[20:00:57] <robertmaxrees> it's its own standard.
[20:01:08] <robertmaxrees> so you're not using DOM methods, hence why jquery isn't really a good fit.
[20:01:46] <Zythyr> Ahhh okay now I understand what you mean.
[20:01:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:02:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry, shoulda clarified earlier.
[20:02:36] <Zythyr> No, not your fault. I am a noob. lol
[20:05:11] <robertmaxrees> haha
[20:05:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry mang.
[20:30:41] <tucan> robertmaxrees: i have no idea what gruntfile is
[20:30:56] <robertmaxrees> wat
[20:31:01] <tucan> it says i need to enable typeahead in plugin list
[20:31:06] <tucan> in that file
[20:31:09] <robertmaxrees> whjat file?
[20:31:26] <tucan> gruntfile.js
[20:31:33] <robertmaxrees> link in github pls
[20:31:40] <tucan> https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead
[20:31:47] <robertmaxrees> err.
[20:31:54] <robertmaxrees> you aren't adding all of those files to your projkect, are you?
[20:32:08] <tucan> all files?
[20:32:22] <robertmaxrees> whjy do you need the gruntfile?
[20:32:46] <tucan> i guess i dont, i dont know what it is
[20:33:02] <tucan> bootstrap3-typeahead.min.js i includd that
[20:33:04] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead#download
[20:33:28] <robertmaxrees> just need one of those.
[20:33:51] <robertmaxrees> then include after your bootstrap lib js files.
[20:34:05] <robertmaxrees> you can to a custom build that integrates with bootstrap, but you don't have to.
[20:36:40] <tucan> robertmaxrees: thats what my html looks like http://paste.scsys.co.uk/552005
[20:37:01] <robertmaxrees> seems about right.
[20:37:15] <tucan> i included  bootstrap3-typeahead.min.js and trying to write myautocomplete.js
[20:37:19] <tucan> but im lost
[20:37:25] <tucan> here's what i have so far
[20:37:25] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost?
[20:37:42] <robertmaxrees> did you read https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead#usage ?
[20:38:03] <tucan> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/552006
[20:38:32] <tucan> yes
[20:38:37] <robertmaxrees> k
[20:38:48] <robertmaxrees> so what's not happening?
[20:39:05] <tucan> none of my words show up
[20:39:51] <tucan> does my script look ok?
[20:40:32] <robertmaxrees> so you didn't read the docs.
[20:40:47] <robertmaxrees> source: function(query, processSync, processAsync) { mwhere do you see references to this?
[20:41:22] <tucan> i tried to copy/paste from some guy on stackoverflow
[20:41:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:41:38] <robertmaxrees> read their docs instead.
[20:41:43] <robertmaxrees> they explain how to use ajax here.
[20:42:00] <robertmaxrees> chekc out https://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-Typeahead#options
[20:42:04] <robertmaxrees> see "source"?  the first arg?
[20:42:32] <tucan> yes
[20:42:57] <robertmaxrees> so check out what the docs say about how it works.
[20:43:19] <tucan> jquery ui had that option too
[20:43:37] <robertmaxrees> tucan bad idea to mix bootstrap and jqui fwiow.
[20:43:48] <tucan> i dont know what i'm supposed to change/ leave alone
[20:43:57] <robertmaxrees> "The function accepts two arguments, the query value in the input field and the process callback. The function may be used synchronously by returning the data source directly or asynchronously via the process callback's single argument."
[20:44:02] <robertmaxrees> so what's different between that and what you have?
[20:44:50] <tucan> i dont know
[20:45:08] <robertmaxrees> so yours says source: function (query, processSync, processAsync) {
[20:45:15] <tucan> yes
[20:45:18] <robertmaxrees> but the docs say "The function accepts two arguments, the query value in the input field and the process callback. "
[20:45:23] <robertmaxrees> see the issue now?
[20:46:30] <tucan> should i remove the process Sync bit?
[20:46:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd remove both and just use "process"
[20:47:04] <RM982> what's wrong with this accordion menu? http://codepen.io/FX187/pen/Lxapmz
[20:47:16] <RM982> the hidden list wont show when I click in the parent
[20:47:25] <robertmaxrees> RM982 open your console
[20:47:35] <tucan> robertmaxrees: keep just query?
[20:47:50] <robertmaxrees> tucan go0nna have to.
[20:47:53] <robertmaxrees> you need it.
[20:47:55] <robertmaxrees> per the docs.
[20:48:03] <RM982> robertmaxrees: firebug doest not show any error
[20:48:17] <robertmaxrees> RM982 try clicking the link.
[20:48:24] <robertmaxrees> or open it and then reload.
[20:48:26] <tucan> robertmaxrees: what do you mean by use "process"
[20:48:28] <RM982> nothing happens, no error
[20:48:36] <robertmaxrees> RM982 i see an error.
[20:48:50] <robertmaxrees> tucan exactly liek what the docs say.
[20:49:04] <RM982> robertmaxrees: weird, can you paste it?
[20:49:06] <robertmaxrees> tucan are you familiar with javascript at all?
[20:49:11] <robertmaxrees> RM982 jquery isn't defined.
[20:49:15] <robertmaxrees> need to include it.
[20:49:21] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use firebug.  just use the native tools.
[20:49:29] <robertmaxrees> firebug is basically no more.\
[20:50:19] <tucan> robertmaxrees: very little
[20:50:26] <tucan> robertmaxrees: like this? http://paste.scsys.co.uk/552007
[20:50:47] <robertmaxrees> tucan gotta fix the other refs to processAsync, too.
[20:51:02] <robertmaxrees> also, don't need those rewturns in there anby more either.
[20:51:24] <RM982> robertmaxrees: I don't know if its added properly in codepen, anyways I am including jquery in my local environment and menu does not work
[20:51:30] <tucan> robertmaxrees: what refs
[20:51:37] <robertmaxrees> tucan ...
[20:51:38] <robertmaxrees> processAsync?
[20:51:45] <robertmaxrees> anywhere ytou used that needs to be changed now.
[20:51:49] <robertmaxrees> since you're no longer using that arg.
[20:51:49] <tucan> yea i removed return line
[20:52:41] <tucan> ok i removed that
[20:52:45] <tucan> what else
[20:52:49] <robertmaxrees> i dunno.
[20:52:59] <robertmaxrees> tucan i'm not going to literally tell you each liuttle thing to change.
[20:53:03] <tucan> do i need $document.ready()
[20:53:03] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'm just coding through you.
[20:53:16] <robertmaxrees> if your js is after you rmarkup, newp.
[20:53:33] <tucan> oh ok
[20:53:50] <tucan> i havent done js in a while
[20:53:55] <robertmaxrees> RM982 easy to see what the issue is.
[20:54:08] <robertmaxrees> RM982 add console.log($(this).next('.menu_child').length); iun that handler.
[20:54:11] <robertmaxrees> see what comes backl?
[20:56:11] <tucan> i was kinda hoping you could write an example i can use/learn from
[20:56:18] <robertmaxrees> tucan that's not how we work here :)
[20:56:33] <robertmaxrees> tucan we help you figure it out, otherwise you're asking us to do free work :)
[20:57:32] <RM982> robertmaxrees: I only get 2 unrelated warnings
[20:57:36] <RM982> ReferenceError: reference to undefined property i.disabled[Learn More]  jquery.min.js:3:12764 ReferenceError: reference to undefined property j.opts.start[Learn More]
[20:57:46] <robertmaxrees> RM982 then your console is messed up.
[20:57:51] <robertmaxrees> you should be getting 0 with that pen.
[20:57:58] <robertmaxrees> every time you click that link.
[20:58:17] <RM982> but why?
[20:58:20] <robertmaxrees> your issue is that .next() is for siblings, but .menu-parent has none.
[20:58:29] <robertmaxrees> because it's a child of a span.
[20:58:42] <robertmaxrees> so .next() won't ever reach that ul.
[20:59:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd do .closest('.list-group-item') to get that shared parent and then .find() the thing you want off that
[20:59:16] <nsosa> hello, I'm submitting a form with jQuery form.submit() but I would like the page to refresh as well how can I do that?
[20:59:29] <tucan> robertmaxrees: looking at the docs, i still dont know what to do with my params  'search' and 'searchtype'
[20:59:31] <robertmaxrees> nsosa huh?
[20:59:51] <robertmaxrees> tucan no idea what you're talking about.
[20:59:57] <RM982> robertmaxrees: but the span closes before the hidden ul, it is like <li><span></span><ul></ul></li>
[20:59:58] <robertmaxrees> your example doesn't have those vars in there.
[21:00:00] <nsosa> robertmaxrees: I have a form, and I'm using the jQuery submit to send the form, the problem is that things on the page do not refresh after the form is submitted
[21:00:10] <robertmaxrees> RM982 the class isn't on the span.
[21:00:18] <robertmaxrees> nsosa code?
[21:00:37] <robertmaxrees> RM982 .menu_parent is on the child of the span.
[21:01:03] <RM982> I see it now, thanks
[21:01:21] <robertmaxrees> RM982 i'd still use that .closest() and .find() combo so the order of the elements doesn't matter.
[21:01:27] <robertmaxrees> less tightly couples your markup to your logic.
[21:01:31] <robertmaxrees> whichj is always a good thing :)
[21:02:15] <nsosa> robertmaxrees:http://dpaste.com/2V81EZT
[21:02:15] <tucan> robertmaxrees: in my jquery ui solution, i have source: function(t, n) { $.get("/words", { search: t.term,  searchtype: e.val() }, function(e) { n(e)  })
[21:02:27] <robertmaxrees> tucan you're not using that any more tho.
[21:02:28] <tucan> is that still valid with Typeahead
[21:02:32] <robertmaxrees> so why refer back to it?
[21:02:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to look at how typeahead works and read about it.
[21:02:52] <tucan> perhaps thats regular jquery code
[21:02:52] <robertmaxrees> the jqui solution will differ in implementation./
[21:03:01] <tucan> :(
[21:03:18] <robertmaxrees> that second arg is the data that gets passed to get.
[21:03:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to figure out how to nab that data in the new way.
[21:03:47] <robertmaxrees> nsosa that'll reload the page.
[21:03:47] <tucan> process?
[21:03:54] <robertmaxrees> tucan huh?
[21:04:02] <robertmaxrees> saying a work with a question mark is a bad way to ask a question lol
[21:04:21] <nsosa> robertmaxrees: it reloads the page but there are things that are not refreshed
[21:04:22] <tucan> robertmaxrees: when you say 2nd arg, you mean process variable?
[21:04:38] <robertmaxrees> tucan i mean for $.get()
[21:04:46] <robertmaxrees> nsosa then you need top fix your backend.
[21:04:58] <robertmaxrees> because that means you're responding with the new page before you're done building it.
[21:05:07] <robertmaxrees> nsosa othjerwise you're reloading the page twice...
[21:06:16] <robertmaxrees> tucan you shoud check out learn.jquery.com and also refer to the api docs.
[21:07:46] <tucan> robertmaxrees: i'm looking at https://api.jquery.com/get/ but not sure what this new way is
[21:07:59] <robertmaxrees> the call itself doesn't change.
[21:08:06] <robertmaxrees> and that's the wrong get.
[21:08:22] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[21:08:25] <robertmaxrees> this is the right one.
[21:08:48] <nsosa> robertmaxrees: it  was a backend problem, you were right
[21:08:49] <nsosa> thanks!!
[21:08:53] <robertmaxrees> nsosa definitely.
[21:08:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[21:09:00] <tucan> oh ok
[21:10:22] <tucan> robertmaxrees: i still dont know what to do, can you give me more pointers
[21:10:48] <robertmaxrees> i don't know where you're lost.
[21:10:51] <robertmaxrees> so it's hard for me to help.
[21:10:52] <tucan> are you saying that code i pasted is correct
[21:10:57] <robertmaxrees> i never said that.
[21:11:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying i can't guide you if i don't know what errors you're getting etc.
[21:12:10] <tucan> should i go to chrome's developer tool and tell you what error i got
[21:12:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:12:29] <robertmaxrees> you should go there, read them, and then try to fix them.
[21:19:47] <tucan> i found something on stackoverflow
[21:20:02] <tucan> but i dont have a good understanding
[21:20:14] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:20:24] <robertmaxrees> just copy/pasting things is generally a bad call.
[21:20:48] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you won't just read the docs and repimplement tho.
[21:26:21] <tucan> i forgott to add data-provide="typeahead"
[21:31:33] <tucan> still doesnt work
[21:32:05] <robertmaxrees> getting console errors?
[21:33:09] <tucan> yes but not from that script
[21:33:37] <robertmaxrees> what are they from?
[21:35:09] <tucan> you're referring to  ctrl + shift + j in Chrome?
[21:35:28] <tucan> in console, i see false
[21:35:38] <tucan> and then All js files are loaded
[21:35:52] <tucan> no errors as far as i can tell
[21:36:25] <robertmaxrees> okay.  and then when you try to use the autocomplete, what happens?
[21:37:54] <robertmaxrees> also: cick click the filter to the right of the clear icon in the upper left and check the "hide network" box.
[21:38:05] <robertmaxrees> that'll help cut down on some of those errors.
[21:38:17] <robertmaxrees> though only do that after you make sure you're not getting 404s for your own fils.
[21:41:32] <tucan> nothing happens
[21:41:42] <tucan> im expecting errors but i dont see any
[21:41:55] <robertmaxrees> what about your network tab?
[21:41:58] <robertmaxrees> that showing anything?
[21:43:51] <tucan> nothing is there
[21:44:03] <tucan> i normally check XHR section
[21:44:09] <robertmaxrees> even when you try to run searches?
[21:44:13] <robertmaxrees> then something is very wrong.
[21:44:14] <tucan> for ajax stuff
[21:44:18] <tucan> yes
[21:44:30] <robertmaxrees> can you link to the page in question?
[21:44:33] <robertmaxrees> or make a test case?
[21:47:45] <tucan> i forgot to link my script
[21:48:26] <tucan> now i see it
[21:48:37] <tucan> i see XHR
[21:49:16] <tucan> words?search=shit
[21:49:36] <tucan> but i dont see any dropdown
[21:50:02] <robertmaxrees> any errors now?
[21:50:15] <tucan> i expect a list of 5 words drop down that matches or contain 'shit'
[21:50:37] <robertmaxrees> do you see any erros in your console now that the file is linked?
[21:51:32] <tucan> i do
[21:51:52] <robertmaxrees> awesome! try fixing them then :)
[21:52:13] <tucan> jquery.min.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at Function.grep (jquery.min.js:2) at Typeahead.process (bootstrap3-typeahead.min.js:1)   at e (jquery.min.js:2) at Object.success (myautocomplete.js:4)
[21:52:19] <tucan> trying to
[21:52:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like ou're passing a bad arg or something then.
[21:52:47] <robertmaxrees> is your return data properly formatted?
[21:53:03] <tucan> on the backend?
[21:53:11] <tucan> i believe so
[21:53:24] <robertmaxrees> so you checked to make sure that's in the format the new autocomplete expects?
[21:53:51] <tucan> im not sure what the new autocomplete expects heh
[21:53:58] <tucan> going to doc again
[21:56:44] <tucan> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/552009
[21:56:51] <tucan> thats what i have currently
[21:57:19] <robertmaxrees> why are the returns there?
[21:57:26] <robertmaxrees> iirc you don't need them.
[21:58:32] <tucan> ok i removed return keyword
[21:58:39] <tucan> 2x
[21:58:50] <robertmaxrees> errors gone?
[21:59:40] <tucan> nope
[21:59:45] <tucan> same errors
[21:59:53] <robertmaxrees> then check your data format.
[22:00:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like that's where your issue is.
[22:01:20] <RM982> $('.menu_parent').on( 'click', function (event) {     $('.menu_child').hide('200');    });  ...how can I avoid this rutine to operate over the closest element with class "menu_child" ?
[22:01:46] <robertmaxrees> RM982 i already told you how.
[22:02:16] <robertmaxrees> RM982 if you're still confused, mind making a new fiddle/pen ?
[22:02:19] <RM982> uhh? I never asked about this
[22:02:28] <robertmaxrees> heh, i already explained it tho.
[22:02:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:05:21] <tucan> how do i check what data is returned
[22:06:04] <robertmaxrees> tucan you can log it out, check out the response in the network tab, hit the resource url directly...
[22:06:06] <robertmaxrees> lots of options.
[22:07:22] <tucan> robertmaxrees: isee headers response cookies preview
[22:07:30] <tucan> not sure where it is
[22:07:46] <robertmaxrees> take a wild guess.
[22:07:49] <tucan> wtf its y2k
[22:07:55] <robertmaxrees> netsplit.
[22:08:08] <robertmaxrees> click those tabs - which one has the data in it?
[22:08:58] <tucan> none of them do
[22:09:05] <robertmaxrees> response should.
[22:09:12] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you hit your searhc url directly?
[22:10:20] <tucan> search url directly is fine
[22:10:34] <tucan> my backend code is completely ok
[22:10:35] <robertmaxrees> what's the response code for it in your network tab then?
[22:10:49] <tucan> 200
[22:10:59] <robertmaxrees> but the response is totally empty?
[22:12:19] <tucan> in response tab i just see the html returned
[22:12:33] <robertmaxrees> wait what
[22:12:36] <robertmaxrees> html?
[22:13:18] <tucan> yes
[22:13:32] <tucan> i should be getting json
[22:13:49] <tucan> dont know why i get html
[22:14:03] <robertmaxrees> hit the page directly.
[22:14:05] <robertmaxrees> and then view source.
[22:15:17] <tucan> search?search=hello&searchtype=english
[22:15:24] <tucan> directly like that?
[22:15:31] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[22:15:36] <robertmaxrees> if that's how you fetch results.
[22:16:22] <tucan> my ajax call is with  words?hel
[22:16:30] <robertmaxrees> ....
[22:16:37] <robertmaxrees> so why wouldn't you hit the same url?
[22:16:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused.
[22:16:49] <robertmaxrees> if you hit it with a particualr url, use that url.
[22:16:52] <robertmaxrees> don't use a different one.
[22:17:05] <robertmaxrees> using a different one will likely give you a different result.
[22:17:22] <tucan> no?
[22:17:27] <robertmaxrees> ...
[22:17:30] <robertmaxrees> they're two different urls.
[22:17:35] <robertmaxrees> why would they be the same thing?
[22:17:37] <tucan> the ajax stuff matches partial text
[22:17:55] <robertmaxrees> so?
[22:17:57] <tucan> the search form post matches full
[22:18:07] <robertmaxrees> which means they're different.
[22:18:19] <tucan> yea they should be
[22:18:36] <robertmaxrees> sooooo what's the problem?
[22:18:43] <robertmaxrees> use the same url.
[22:18:52] <tucan> no why
[22:19:16] <robertmaxrees> because it's different from your real-world test case.
[22:19:36] <tucan> i dont understand
[22:21:08] <robertmaxrees> i've PM'd you.
[22:21:13] <robertmaxrees> we're talking in circled.
[22:21:17] <robertmaxrees> *circles.
[22:21:20] <robertmaxrees> hit me up there.
[22:29:35] <acidjazz> whoa whoa who here is pm'ing w/out my consultation
[22:38:57] <otahak> hey guys. I need help selecting a child on the 3rd level. how would I do this correctly? $url = $(this).children('.caption h4 a').attr('href');
[22:40:45] <otahak> lol nvm. .find()
[22:49:48] <jak2017> hi all
[22:50:57] <jak2017> exist a way for know the number of days in a month? i want the user choose(selec/option): Year, choose(select/option) Month, and then select the day, but if user choose February .....
[22:51:26] <robertmaxrees> jak2017 use a datepicker.
[22:51:30] <robertmaxrees> there's tons and they handle this for youy.
[22:51:32] <robertmaxrees> *you
[22:52:13] <jak2017> robertmaxrees yes actually i use jquery datepicker but the user, want select/option :(
[22:52:19] <jak2017> any control?
[22:52:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:52:28] <robertmaxrees> "select/option"?
[22:52:33] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to hand-roll something (and i don't see why you would), the built-in Date constructor can give you that info.
[22:52:39] <robertmaxrees> or for added ease - moment.js
[22:53:32] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i gotta go.
[22:53:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[22:56:16] <jak2017> robertBusy have any sample?
[22:56:17] <jak2017> thanks
