[00:58:27] <`ULT> hi guess i`m stucked
[00:58:35] <`ULT> *guys
[00:58:49] <Cork> *stuck
[00:58:50] <Cork> :)
[00:59:03] <Cork> just ask the question if you have one
[00:59:36] <`ULT> ^^
[00:59:49] <`ULT> again a problem with icheck
[01:00:10] <`ULT> I can show you a fiddle
[01:00:11] <`ULT> 1 moment
[01:00:20] <Cork> i wasn't here at the end, did you get that problem solved?
[01:00:34] <`ULT> yes, that was something realy weird.
[01:01:06] <`ULT> [17:00:51] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/8bs2ev
[01:01:50] <`ULT> Cork i will made two fiddles: one without icheck and one with icheck
[01:01:55] <Cork> that sounds like a bug in the plugin
[01:02:18] <Cork> `ULT: on a different note, why do you use js for styling a checkbox?
[01:02:33] <Cork> you know you can do that with pure css right?
[01:03:32] <`ULT> yes, i read this article on fronteed
[01:03:34] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/8c1txl
[01:04:10] <Cork> ya, though that isn't what i was talking about
[01:04:26] <`ULT> what do you mean than?
[01:04:39] <Cork> let me make an example
[01:05:06] <`ULT> thx!
[01:05:26] <`ULT> but i thougt there arguments sounds legit to use icheck
[01:05:50] <Cork> except you can make a css one that works in any decent browser
[01:06:07] <Cork> sure it will break in ie6 and older
[01:06:11] <Cork> but honestly who cares
[01:06:26] <`ULT> thats sounds better idd
[01:06:31] <`ULT> ie6 i dont need to support
[01:06:51] <`ULT> if it`s oke in 8 i`m fine.
[01:10:12] <Cork> `ULT: http://jsfiddle.net/tehndtoq/
[01:10:19] <Cork> that is just a quick mockup
[01:10:43] <Cork> you prob want to grab an image or a symbol font for the check symbol
[01:10:46] <`ULT> looks very nice to me.
[01:11:06] <`ULT> this is working in ie 7/8?
[01:11:20] <Cork> i only test ie9+
[01:11:23] <Cork> but it should
[01:11:37] <`ULT> and the other usual browsers
[01:11:37] <Cork> the browser needs to support :before that's the only requirement
[01:11:45] <`ULT> aah oke. thank you!
[01:12:05] <Cork> well :before and the folowing selector
[01:12:09] <Cork> ( + )
[01:12:21] <`ULT> so you recommend this instead of the icheck plugin?
[01:12:52] <Cork> well i'm not a fan for using js for styling/layout unless it really isn't possible without
[01:13:01] <Cork> recommend might be a bit strong
[01:13:25] <`ULT> sounds legit to me. thank you.
[01:13:30] <Cork> the web today has gone very fanboyism on js for everything
[01:13:33] <Cork> and i really don't like that
[01:13:40] <`ULT> my problem is also fixed with css styling instead of the icheck plugin
[01:15:19] <Cork> (btw the solution i gave you is what i developed for the site i manage)
[01:15:27] <Cork> so it is what i use my self
[01:15:28] <Uhkis> Cork: so true, internet goes pretty broken if you disable js
[01:15:40] <Cork> Uhkis: luckely not THAT broken
[01:15:59] <Cork> but far too often it is required without any defense for requiring it
[01:16:24] <Cork> "oh, you can't see this page cause js needs to do $('body').removeClass('hide')"
[01:16:30] <Cork> jquery forms ^
[01:17:14] <Cork> so a browser stylesheat that sets .hide { display: block !important; } is a usable workaround...
[01:17:24] <Cork> i mean.. seriously?!?
[01:17:36] <Uhkis> i've done the other way around in my projects, hide with js
[01:17:44] <Cork> well that is the correct way
[01:17:51] <Cork> how you SHOULD do it
[01:18:23] <Cork> but i feel some sites break none js viewing just for breaking none js viewing
[01:20:24] <`ULT> cork, can you see this screenshot also?
[01:20:25] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/8c1y7c
[01:20:34] <`ULT> this is what happening
[01:21:09] <Cork> `ULT: the plugin most likely wraps the input elements so you're .parent() breaks
[01:21:21] <Cork> just me guessing though
[01:22:07] <`ULT> you can see it live on: https://jsfiddle.net/SUTMf/43/
[01:22:26] <`ULT> i have tested .parents() dont think that is the problem.
[01:22:42] <`ULT> but maybe i am wrong, i`m a noobie xD
[01:23:23] <`ULT> when you check the checkbox, you see realy apart behavior
[01:25:03] <Cork> heh yay mixed content blocking >_>
[01:26:31] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/SUTMf/43/
[01:26:33] <Uhkis> fixed ;)
[01:26:56] <Cork> O_o
[01:27:04] <Cork> you can get jsfiddle to use http??
[01:27:06] <Cork> didn't know that
[01:28:02] <Cork> `ULT: $(this).parents("tr") this is a dangerous thing to do
[01:28:12] <`ULT> Uhkis, what do you have done? it is still not working correct? ;)
[01:28:14] <Cork> you most likely want $(this).closest("tr") not .parents
[01:28:36] <Cork> `ULT: he got the plugin loading by getting jsfiddle to use http instead of https so the loading wasn't blocked
[01:28:37] <`ULT> oke, why it is dangerous?
[01:28:48] <Cork> cause parents will select all parent elements matching the selector
[01:28:57] <`ULT> and we only need the closest
[01:28:58] <Cork> not just the one you current expect to be there
[01:29:04] <Cork> exactly
[01:29:08] <`ULT> thanks!
[01:29:23] <Cork> (it is a common mistake for some reason, so don't feel bad about it)
[01:29:30] <`ULT> will read about it
[01:29:56] <Cork> .closest() is basically the exact same thing as .parents().first()
[01:30:03] <Cork> except .closest() is a bit faster
[01:30:11] <`ULT> nice :)
[01:30:13] <Cork> (though the difference should be so small it shouldn't matter)
[01:30:24] <`ULT> i like speed!
[01:30:48] <Cork> `ULT: ok, so over to the question, you need to define "doesn't work"
[01:30:53] <Cork> meaning, what should happen
[01:30:57] <Cork> and what happens instead
[01:31:27] <`ULT> allright i try!
[01:31:31] <`ULT> I make a screenshot
[01:31:46] <`ULT> press the first checkbox: bestel mee
[01:32:27] <`ULT> the price left from it (235) need to add to totaal toebehorens
[01:32:31] <`ULT> (when it is checked)
[01:32:52] <`ULT> when the box is unchecked, the price need to be subtracted from totaal toebehorens (price = 0)
[01:33:58] <`ULT> you you add  console.log (($this)); on line 109 you can see what is happening
[01:34:18] <`ULT> the first action (change) is skipped
[01:34:37] <`ULT> it looks like the loop is running at the second action
[01:36:51] <Cork> hmm
[01:36:59] <Cork> ok i need to read though this
[01:37:04] <Cork> i just saw another thing
[01:37:17] <Cork> you change the value of the checkbox based on if it is checked or not
[01:37:25] <Cork> that is pointless and you don't need to do that
[01:37:45] <Cork> though you have the hidden fallback element after the checkbox instead of before
[01:37:49] <Cork> and that will break things
[01:38:49] <Cork> you should have <input type="hidden" class="toggle-options" name="accessories[319]" value="0"><input type="checkbox" name="accessories[319]" value="1" class="toggle-options"><label>Bestel mee</label>
[01:38:56] <`ULT> cork, that is a dirty way to fix the bacend php stuff
[01:39:07] <`ULT> to add the product to the cart
[01:39:14] <Cork> the way i show you should solve it too
[01:39:18] <Cork> without needing js to do that
[01:39:34] <`ULT> moment
[01:39:49] <Cork> cause if the checkbox isn't checked the hidden value will be sent to the server
[01:39:58] <`ULT> will trie to understand that
[01:40:02] <`ULT> try
[01:40:06] <Cork> if the checkbox is checked first the hidden value will be send, and then the checkbox value
[01:40:16] <Cork> so the checkbox value will overwrite the hidden value
[01:40:25] <Cork> it is how forms are designed to work with checkboxes
[01:40:52] <Cork> so all backends support it (unless possibly if you write it in c and do bad post parsing :) )
[01:42:15] <`ULT> [10:37:03] <Cork> i just saw another thing
[01:42:16] <`ULT> [10:37:17] <Cork> you change the value of the checkbox based on if it is checked or not
[01:42:26] <`ULT> can you give me the linenumbers?
[01:42:42] <Cork> `ULT: 122-125
[01:42:57] <`ULT> yes i thougt that.
[01:43:23] <Cork> well i think you have it in 132 - 136 too
[01:43:28] <`ULT> true!
[01:43:29] <Cork> but not fully sure there
[01:43:46] <`ULT> 121-128 is working for default checkboxes and can be disabled
[01:44:02] <`ULT> and 130 - 139 is for icheck
[01:44:36] <`ULT> i give you the live working exacmple without icheck, than you can see what is going on
[01:44:39] <`ULT> 1 moment
[01:44:58] <Cork> `ULT: i'm sorry but i think i'll have to leave this to someone else
[01:45:01] <Cork> i need to get back to work
[01:45:11] <`ULT> aah oke, thanks for your help
[01:45:39] <`ULT> i think i will try the css styled checkboxes you gave me.
[01:45:52] <`ULT> than everything is working correct.
[01:46:10] <Cork> ya, well i had a bit of a trouble figuring out what you had problem with...
[01:46:12] <`ULT> and maybe you later can see at rules 121 - 128, the reason why i use that
[01:47:06] <Cork> "bit of a trouble"... *sigh*
[01:47:17] <Cork> i really is unfocused right now...
[01:48:15] <`ULT> ^^
[02:12:58] <toomus> Hi all
[02:13:08] <Uhkis> hello!
[02:14:25] <toomus> I want to ask you what is the best practices for making realtime suggestions
[02:15:10] <toomus> I mean when user is typing in some input field, I want to ask server for suggestions
[02:15:51] <Cork> toomus: not sure what you mean
[02:15:59] <Cork> best practises about what?
[02:16:16] <Cork> how to do it to not hammer the server?
[02:16:31] <toomus> Cork: yeah, exactly that I mean :)
[02:16:47] <Cork> well the cleanest solution is to use a timer on keyinput
[02:17:00] <Cork> and not fire a question to the server until the timer fires
[02:17:09] <Cork> and on each keyinput reset the timer
[02:17:37] <Cork> so the effect gets that the lookup doens't happen until say 20 ms of key inactivity
[02:17:42] <toomus> Ah you mean not to ask server until user stop typing?
[02:18:06] <Cork> then you can change the timeout until you get a rate limit you think balances the responsiveness and server load
[02:18:14] <Cork> yes
[02:18:29] <toomus> Cork: great idea, THX :)
[02:18:30] <Cork> if you set the timer to 10 ms it will basically be instant
[02:18:41] <Cork> and if that gets to be too much load just up the timeout
[02:19:04] <Cork> it is easy to implement too so you can do it very cleanly
[02:20:49] <Cork> $('input.autocomplete').on('input', function() { clearTimeout($(this).data('timer')); $(this).data('timer', setTimeout(function() { /* make call */ }, 50)) });
[02:21:08] <toomus> Cork: awesome, thx :)
[02:22:25] <Uhkis> <input type="text" class="autocomplete" data-timer="somethingorother">
[02:22:55] <Cork> <_< preferably not :/
[02:23:07] <Cork> though i think clearTimeout would handle that
[02:23:17] <Cork> it is quite accepting of weird input :)
[02:23:46] <Cork> but ya, the code i gave expects timer to not be used outside that code line
[02:24:00] <Uhkis> wouldn't it just get undefined if the data-timer is missing?
[02:24:22] <Cork> ya, and that is expected
[02:24:32] <Cork> the first time you type it is undefined
[02:24:44] <Cork> the second character clears the old timer (unless it has already fired)
[02:24:45] <Cork> and so on
[02:26:31] <Uhkis> Passing an invalid ID to clearTimeout does not have any effect (and doesn't throw an exception).
[02:26:44] <Uhkis> so tolerant function! :D
[02:26:46] <toomus> Cork: It works :) THX :)
[02:27:02] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, and that is why i commented on data-timer="some-random-string"
[02:39:17] <km4> hi guys, http://jsfiddle.net/7pq436L9/ can reduce this code ? its fine ?
[02:40:45] <Cork> km4: it most likely can
[02:40:54] <Cork> but first, what is the click thing meant to be?
[02:42:38] <Cork> also what is the point of doing slider.push('slider'); ?
[02:42:47] <km4> click call result. Result take true or false, like answer in polls yes or no
[02:42:49] <Cork> (statically)
[02:43:30] <Cork> cause you do <type>.push(type); in every if case
[02:43:43] <Cork> so i get a bit confused about what is the point of it
[02:44:14] <km4> push a element on array and get how many this slider exist. in higcharts I got value of all slider(slider.length)
[02:44:40] <Cork> ya but why not just ex. slide_results.length?
[02:44:56] <Cork> why have a slider = ['slider', 'slider', 'slider', 'slider', 'slider']
[02:45:15] <Cork> and a bar = ['bar','bar' ,'bar']
[02:45:47] <Cork> it looks just wasteful to me
[02:45:50] <km4> all this slider, bar, popup etc is the type template my trigger
[02:46:04] <Cork> ya i get that
[02:46:12] <Cork> but you already have the type in the variable name
[02:46:16] <km4> and I use http://www.highcharts.com/demo/column-drilldown this chart
[02:46:20] <Cork> why store it as a load of duplicated strings?
[02:47:38] <km4> http://hastebin.com/urafadehir.cpp this is my 'json' with all triggers
[02:47:52] <Cork> anyway this would do the same as your code http://jsfiddle.net/7pq436L9/1/
[02:48:34] <Cork> only difference is that you get types.slider_results instead of slider_results
[02:49:08] <Cork> but ya, again i don't see the point of storing the string duplicated
[02:51:01] <km4> ok I check and testing this.
[02:56:23] <km4> Cork: works fine :) nice code
[03:10:53] <anew> when i run $get and get an error, can i store that error in a var and reprint it ?
[03:16:24] <anew> where is everyone today
[03:17:05] <Kamuela> anew do you mean $.get
[03:17:23] <anew> yes
[03:17:49] <Kamuela> like $.get(url).success(data) { console.log(data); });
[03:18:42] <Shadow> Hi, can anyone help with this please. http://pastebin.com/8rASjwXk Where have I gone wrong with the var name
[03:18:42] <anew> yes but there is an error, so when i do console.log nothing comes back
[03:19:40] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/hd0wcanj/
[03:19:43] <anew> Kamuela,
[03:20:22] <anew> the redirect is to another domain... so i get the error, but i need the url that it produces from the error
[03:21:12] <Kamuela> anew, https://jsfiddle.net/hd0wcanj/1/
[03:22:46] <anew> Kamuela, damn... not hta tdidnt print to console... it's a "no access-control-allow-origin' error
[03:23:05] <anew> so i get no results from the $.get... but i just need the url that the console says
[03:24:15] <km4> maybe use $.getJSON(url, function(data){ }); or $ajax ?
[03:25:42] <anew> http://i.imgur.com/H4vDRGY.png
[03:25:46] <anew> this is the error i get in console
[03:25:58] <anew> that url on the top with 4244 is what i need
[03:26:08] <Kamuela> anew, you'll need to setup CORS if you have access to the server
[03:26:31] <anew> i dont need any data from the other server
[03:26:35] <anew> i just need the url !
[03:28:10] <Shadow> can anyone tell me whats wrong with the var name, please
[03:29:27] <anew> please anyone
[03:29:53] <km4> Shadow: its work http://jsfiddle.net/campu1bb/
[03:30:25] <goschtl> hey, is there i jquery plugin which can allow users only once to fill out a html-form (quizz)
[03:30:32] <goschtl> once
[03:32:12] <Cork> goschtl: you can't really control that reliably
[03:32:23] <Cork> goschtl: client side can always be worked around
[03:32:46] <Cork> and server side could block on ip, but that can result in both false positive and false negative
[03:33:20] <goschtl> Cork: ok thanks
[03:33:37] <Cork> and to be clear
[03:33:51] <goschtl> i thought maybe there is a plugin already where i can show what options i have. i already thought that it could be difficult
[03:33:53] <Cork> false positive is cause quite large networks is behind nats
[03:34:10] <Cork> and false negative is when one person has dynamic ip or multiple ips
[03:34:18] <Shadow> km4: it should display the tile. e.g. Demo
[03:34:36] <Cork> goschtl: well you can't ever implement security in js
[03:34:44] <Cork> it has to happen server side
[03:35:00] <Cork> hmm s/js/client side/
[03:35:21] <Cork> cause if you do it client side the user could just post it to the server without running the blocking code
[03:35:26] <Cork> and your security would fall flat
[03:36:06] <goschtl> Cork: ok thx for info
[03:41:46] <instance> hey I'm trying to customize the css on jquery mobile, by making my own css and linking it, but it doesn't seem to be working. Any help?
[03:44:09] <Shadow> Why is this not displaying the var name in the alert. http://jsfiddle.net/campu1bb/1/
[03:45:59] <Cork> Shadow: don't use alert for debugging
[03:46:01] <Uhkis> Shadow: because this.title is empty
[03:47:04] <Shadow> Uhkis: this.title.a didn't work either
[03:47:07] <instance> anyone here familiar with jquery mobile?
[03:47:10] <Kamuela> Shadow, you'd have to say something like $(this).child('.title').text()
[03:47:19] <Cork> Shadow: http://jsfiddle.net/campu1bb/2/
[03:47:32] <Cork> no not child
[03:47:59] <Kamuela> isn't it though?
[03:48:06] <Cork> there isn't a child function
[03:48:12] <Cork> you might be thinking of children()
[03:48:13] <Kamuela> well lol, that'll do it
[03:48:21] <Kamuela> would children do it?
[03:48:48] <Cork> sure .children or .find both work in this case
[03:48:54] <Kamuela> also, what is trim doing in that context Cork ?
[03:48:55] <Shadow> Cork: I don't want the Demo and Demo2 to show in the result box like the lng and lat
[03:49:11] <Cork> Shadow: ok, then what is it you want to do?
[03:49:42] <Cork> i just fixed the code you wrote
[03:49:55] <Cork> so if what you wrote isn't what you want i can't do much about that
[03:51:06] <Uhkis> we're not psychic :-)
[03:51:13] <Shadow> Cork: was trying to get the data the same as lng and lat, but that was as close as I could get
[03:51:34] <Cork> Shadow: well the only title in there is the class element
[03:52:04] <Cork> so if you don't want that element what title are you looking for?
[03:58:06] <instance> can someone help me? it seems like I can't figure out how to edit these damn jquery mobile elements in css???
[03:58:21] <Shadow> Cork: on the jsfiddle page why does it display in the results box for the name and not the lat and lng
[03:59:13] <Cork> Shadow: it displays both
[03:59:39] <Cork> or rather it displays lat and name (as you wrote the code)
[03:59:59] <Cork> Shadow: http://jsfiddle.net/campu1bb/3/
[04:00:04] <Cork> slightly modified
[04:00:56] <Shadow> sorry not the console.log. In the results box of jsfiddle it displays Demo and Demo2
[04:01:13] <Cork> yaa?
[04:01:26] <Cork> those are test link texts
[04:01:32] <Cork> what else should show?
[04:02:00] <Shadow> Is it going to output Demo and Demo2 on my page, as I don't want that
[04:02:12] <Cork> uh it doesn't output anything
[04:02:18] <Cork> it displays the html you have in the page
[04:02:53] <Cork> and yes if you put <a>Demo</a> and <a>Demo2</a> in the page they will show
[04:03:26] <Shadow> ok thats fine then. I was thinking that jquery was doing that.
[04:03:43] <Cork> jquery just loops the elements....
[04:03:47] <Shadow> Sorry and thank you for all your help
[04:03:50] <Cork> or don't you know what your own code does?
[04:17:27] <anew> shouldnt a simple php echo show up in consolf if i'm doing $.get to the url ?
[04:17:47] <Uhkis> if you grab the data, yes
[04:18:47] <anew> $.get("url.com, function(data){console.log(data););
[04:19:06] <taplar> typo on the missing "?
[04:19:10] <Cork> make sure the request works
[04:19:10] <anew> yes
[04:19:17] <Cork> meaning returns a 200 result
[04:19:29] <Cork> also attach a .fail() handler
[04:20:01] <Cork> $.get("url.com", function(data){console.log(data);).fail(function(xhr,status,throw) { console.log(status, throw); });
[04:20:10] <taplar> missing closing } on your cussess
[04:20:12] <taplar> success
[04:20:16] <anew> i mean when i run this i get success... but then nothing spits out from the php file
[04:20:16] <taplar> wow
[04:20:23] <Cork> ah
[04:20:35] <Cork> anew: check what you get in the network console of the browser
[04:20:51] <anew> 200
[04:21:03] <Cork> no i meant what data you get there
[04:21:22] <Cork> so you're not debuggin js when php fails
[04:21:32] <anew> oh hmm....  network->xhr
[04:22:28] <anew> sorry... where does it show data in network... all i see is get/200/xhr/
[04:22:36] <taplar> response or something
[04:22:47] <Cork> depends on the browser
[04:23:03] <taplar> yeah, just go to network, click on the request and options will show on the right
[04:23:22] <Cork> in some of them, again it exist in all browsers
[04:23:25] <Cork> where depends though
[04:24:43] <taplar> since it looks like a simple get request, you could just stick it in your browser window too
[04:24:50] <taplar> if your echoing a string it should show on the page
[04:29:42] <anew> sorry was in the bathroom
[04:31:32] <anew> http://i.imgur.com/JYkuYiT.png
[04:31:35] <anew> that's all i see in the console
[04:31:40] <anew> nothing on the right
[04:31:57] <taplar> i'm assuming its the php request?
[04:32:00] <taplar> click it
[04:33:35] <anew> ah
[04:33:45] <anew> ok after i click it says no properties
[04:34:07] <Uhkis> how about loading the url normally in your browser to test it
[04:34:07] <Cork> you should have a "Response" tab at the top of the new section
[04:34:33] <anew> actually it's printing something out from somewhere else in the code
[04:34:33] <Uhkis> also: is it on the same domain?
[04:34:35] <anew> ok thanks guys
[04:34:43] <anew> under response yeah i had to cilck it
[04:35:01] <anew> but why doesnt it show in console when i console.log?
[04:35:22] <Uhkis> anew: how about showing the actual code
[04:36:10] <taplar> just going to throw this out there just so it's said.  are you seeing any console logs?  it could be switched off
[04:36:37] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/jwjxhkkm/
[04:36:40] <anew> code is just that
[04:38:00] <anew> eh how do u see if it's switched off or not
[04:38:05] <taplar> oh
[04:38:16] <taplar> second parameter of a success callback is textstatus
[04:38:18] <Uhkis> anew: you're missing protocol for url.com
[04:38:25] <anew> actually just tested it's on console.log
[04:38:25] <Uhkis> or that's not the actual code
[04:38:47] <anew> what u mean protocol
[04:38:54] <anew> that's the actual code, i just repleced my url with url.com
[04:38:56] <anew> that's exactly what i have
[04:39:14] <taplar> he's saying your missing http or https
[04:39:25] <Uhkis> yeah, better replace the most important part :-)
[04:39:33] <anew> ah ok i have that... http://url.com
[04:40:01] <Cork> that would indicate cross domain though
[04:40:34] <anew> argh sorry, url is fine... i just edited out my actual url sorry
[04:40:39] <anew> http://samedomain.com
[04:40:45] <taplar> heh
[04:40:56] <Cork> so '/path/to/resource.php'
[04:42:17] <anew> no.. .'http://samedomain.com/path/to/resource.php'
[04:42:41] <Cork> normally it is better to just use an absolute path instead of a full url
[04:43:00] <Cork> cause if you ex do http://samedomain.com => https://samedomain.com you will again do cross domain
[04:43:12] <taplar> or do //samedomain.com
[04:43:32] <Cork> true, but if you move it to another domain you're back at it again :)
[04:43:44] <taplar> ya
[04:43:45] <Cork> so if it isn't cors, just don't allow it to ever be
[04:44:00] <anew> ok
[04:46:38] <morphyeys> hello guys, how to delete the value of field with id hotel_id ?
[04:46:53] <morphyeys> I've tried $('#hotel_id').val(''); and empty but that's not what I need
[04:46:58] <Cork> $('#hotel_id').val('')
[04:47:07] <Cork> uh
[04:47:08] <taplar> anew: so what do you see with this https://jsfiddle.net/jwjxhkkm/1/
[04:47:12] <morphyeys> hmm maybe that's what I need
[04:47:19] <morphyeys> I am trying to remove the hotel_id= from the URL
[04:47:27] <anew> let me try
[04:47:28] <Cork> the url...
[04:47:31] <taplar> y?
[04:47:43] <Cork> morphyeys: jquery is for handling elements not the url
[04:48:12] <Cork> morphyeys: you could do window.location.href =window.location.href.replace('hotel_id=', '')
[04:48:17] <Cork> though note this will reload the page
[04:48:49] <Cork> optionally you could use the history.pushState
[04:51:04] <anew> success status: success
[04:51:17] <anew> taplar i think i have something, that did something
[04:52:30] <anew> woot
[04:52:34] <anew> data showing what i need now
[04:52:37] <anew> damn awesome
[04:52:47] <taplar> cool
[04:52:51] <anew> thanks man
[04:57:49] <Pazician> Hello everyone, how should I write if I want to add a class on a element with a class of "added", but the class called "added" is only added if the user has clicked the button
[04:58:01] <morphyeys> thanks
[04:58:09] <Cork> uh
[04:58:17] <Cork> why would it matter how the class was added?
[04:58:29] <Pazician> This is how I've tried: http://pastebin.com/gSawfUb0
[04:58:32] <Cork> $('.added').addClass('the-class')
[04:58:45] <Pazician> Cork: I tried, but it didn't work
[04:58:57] <Cork> then you did something else that failed
[04:59:13] <Pazician> Cork: Let me try again
[04:59:15] <Cork> make a jsfiddle showing the problem you're trying to solve
[04:59:26] <taplar> just from that code snipplet, 'added' variable looks undefined
[04:59:38] <Cork> true
[05:00:03] <Cork> Pazician: also from the pb do you want to check if the clicked element has the class
[05:00:10] <Cork> and if it does add the new class?
[05:00:18] <Pazician> Cork: Yes, exactly
[05:00:35] <Cork> cause then you want $(this).filter('.added').addClass('fa-arrows');
[05:00:41] <Cork> (no if needed)
[05:01:14] <Cork> also $(this).on('click', function() { indicates you add click handlers in a loop
[05:01:21] <Cork> and that isn't something you should do
[05:01:27] <Cork> so ya, more context is needed
[05:02:26] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, I understand but I really don't understand why it doesn't add the class to the element, since it's added later on when you click on the element and it gets the class "added"
[05:02:56] <Cork> well to start with added isn't defined
[05:03:17] <Cork> and ya, you're hiding too much context for anyone to give useful comments
[05:03:28] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/jwjxhkkm/2/ taplar when i add this to your code it says data.text() is not a function i'm trying to split the results
[05:03:32] <Pazician> http://puu.sh/jYrow/82eecf2fbe.png - there's no "fa-works", but it should work just fine, right?
[05:03:42] <Cork> no images or pbs
[05:03:57] <Cork> make a jsfiddle demo showing the code needed to understand the problem
[05:04:17] <taplar> anew: data should already be text
[05:04:23] <Cork> don't make ppl jump to hoops trying to help you
[05:07:15] <Pazician> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/56sqrL94/
[05:07:45] <Cork> Pazician: well ya, that wont work
[05:08:10] <Cork> as the code flow is: 1. bind a click handler on window, 2. filter window for a class .added (doesn't exist)
[05:08:23] <Cork> and then a click anywhere on the page adds a added to a button
[05:08:52] <Cork> so ya, this is obviously not even close to the work your actually working with
[05:09:06] <Cork> *to the code you're working with*
[05:09:36] <Pazician> Cork: Thank you, I'm running already late, I gotta run for a quick meeting, brb - I hope you'll be here in a few minutes
[05:09:57] <anew> can i .append() <script></script> ?
[05:10:17] <Cork> yes, but you shouldn't do it
[05:11:00] <Cork> append will grab app script tabs in the html section and call globalEval on the content in them
[05:11:16] <Cork> uh... *grab all* i type like crap...
[05:11:23] <anew> Cork i have external js link that i need to append a number to
[05:11:29] <anew> only way i can think of doing it is with append
[05:11:56] <Cork> "append a number too"?
[05:12:00] <Cork> to the url you mean?
[05:12:59] <anew> yes, so i have http://js.com and i need to make it http://js.com/1234
[05:13:36] <Cork> well the best option is to inject a script tag in the header of the page
[05:14:10] <anew> that's not with append, what is that with ?
[05:14:16] <Cork> $(document.head).append($('<script>', { src: "url" + "1234" }));
[05:14:28] <anew> ah great
[05:14:34] <Cork> though ya i would prob not use jquery for that
[05:14:44] <Cork> it does too much magic if you give it script tags
[05:14:56] <anew> i have to get this number with ajax.... so everything is already created after the fact
[05:15:04] <Cork> actually
[05:15:10] <Cork> another option is to just use $.getScript
[05:15:33] <Cork> and is prob the better option if your going to trigger globalEval anyway
[05:16:38] <anew> Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened.
[05:16:41] <anew> damn i got this error
[05:16:55] <Cork> oooh...
[05:17:03] <Cork> your using document.write... good luck with that...
[05:17:26] <Cork> (hint never ever EVER accept a script that uses document.write)
[05:17:31] <Cork> or document.write.ln
[05:17:32] <Cork> uh
[05:17:35] <Cork> *document.writeln
[05:17:48] <anew> argh
[05:17:49] <anew> kill me
[05:17:52] <anew> so what can i do
[05:18:08] <Cork> you have to add the script statically in the body of the page
[05:18:16] <Cork> cause it has to run as the page parses the first time
[05:18:20] <Cork> or document.write won't work
[05:18:33] <Cork> alternatively you can rewrite it to not use document.write
[05:18:46] <Cork> (and this is why you should never accept them)
[05:19:00] <anew> motherf....
[05:19:12] <anew> both arent an option
[05:19:26] <anew> man
[05:19:26] <Cork> you could load the content in an iframe
[05:19:35] <Cork> and have the link statically generated in the iframe
[05:19:44] <Cork> that is about your only other option
[05:19:54] <anew> i create the iframe with jq ?
[05:19:58] <Cork> sure
[05:20:19] <Cork> you could create an iframe point it at a php resource
[05:20:27] <Cork> and have the php generate the correct script url
[05:20:53] <anew> the number i need to append is the problem... so i need to i guess send this number back to my server
[05:20:55] <Cork> it is actually good in another way as the script will be completely isolated from the rest of your page
[05:21:02] <anew> hmmm ok
[05:21:05] <Cork> exactly
[05:21:18] <anew> so get number with ajax, send number back to server... on button click create iframe with appended number
[05:21:36] <norc_> Hi. Is there any notable difference between IE and Firefox/Chome with regards to $.ajax and $.Deferred? (I have a large library that misbehaves badly randomly when calling into an $.ajax wrapper under IE)
[05:21:45] <Cork> $('#target').append($('<iframe>' , { src: '/path/to/script.php?number=1234' }));
[05:21:50] <Cork> anew: ^
[05:22:05] <norc_> And before I start debugging into the depths of this library I was wondering whether this could be some well known IE issues.
[05:22:15] <Cork> norc_: what version of ie?
[05:22:36] <norc_> Cork: IE10, let me figure out whether its running in standards mode
[05:22:41] <anew> Cork can i append the number at all inside jq in one go... .i dont want to have to send it back to server, etc
[05:22:50] <anew> no i guess not
[05:22:53] <anew> has to all be static
[05:22:58] <anew> argh ok, thanks let me try
[05:23:02] <Cork> anew: nope the script has to be statically in the html the iframe loads
[05:23:08] <anew> ok
[05:23:13] <Cork> so you can't load a blank page and add the script with js
[05:23:28] <Cork> cause then you would be back at the added after initial load again
[05:23:40] <Cork> anew: start to see why document.write is a real pain? :D
[05:23:51] <anew> yeah this really turned into a big thing here
[05:24:58] <norc_> Cork: Correction, this is IE11. Used jQuery version is 1.7.2
[05:25:08] <norc_> And no compability mode activated.
[05:25:17] <Cork> norc_: hmm not sure if 1.7 has deferred
[05:25:21] <norc_> Cork: It does.
[05:25:35] <Cork> oh 1.5 ya that was way older then i thought
[05:25:52] <Cork> norc_: what is the problem your getting btw?
[05:26:38] <norc_> Cork: Specifically this ajax wrapper (which under the hood causes velocity templates with crazy tons of Java Code mixed in to be rendered) resolves the $.ajax deferred with null objects.
[05:26:54] <Cork> O_o
[05:26:56] <Cork> java code??
[05:27:01] <Cork> or did you mean javascript?
[05:27:05] <norc_> No Java.
[05:27:10] <Cork> <_<'
[05:27:29] <Cork> i suspect you have the problem right there...
[05:27:37] <Cork> and no i haven't seen anything like that
[05:27:56] <Cork> only problem i have with ie11 is some rendering glitches
[05:28:00] <Cork> ajax works fine
[05:28:07] <norc_> Cork: The Java is just part of the views of the server architecture. To the JavaScript library there is just a HTTP resource.
[05:28:14] <norc_> Alright.
[05:28:20] <norc_> Deferred too I suppose?
[05:28:28] <Cork> ya
[05:28:37] <Cork> i write all my ajax that way now days :)
[05:28:59] <norc_> Cork: Its absolutely beautiful. I even started using $.Callbacks to implement some Observer patterns.
[05:29:11] <Cork> ya, same here
[05:29:20] <Cork> well not started but ya i've used it for a long time
[05:29:30] <Cork> makes callbacks much cleaner to implement
[05:29:50] <Cork> and not to forget the code becomes much more readable
[05:29:59] <norc_> Hehe, well I'm used to the Observer pattern from Qts signal/slot architecture. It just took me a while to figure out JavaScript. :)
[05:30:17] <norc_> Yeah, especially observer solves dependency and callback hell problems.
[05:31:15] <norc_> Now I wish for usuable events. ;)
[05:31:22] <Cork> but ya... i consider java on the web to be absolutely forbidden
[05:31:40] <Cork> i've canceled several services cause they require it...
[05:31:50] <Cork> flash is close to the same though
[05:32:05] <Cork> i'm a little more accepting there, but just a little
[05:32:25] <Cork> (currently don't have java or flash installed)
[05:32:52] <taplar> i dislike flash, but it's probably mostly my setup.  i have it set up auto update, but it doesn't.
[05:33:16] <Cork> i hate it cause it is (and always has been) a crappy implementation
[05:33:29] <Cork> and hence all the cves for it
[05:33:37] <norc_> Cork: Have you ever worked with JSF?
[05:33:45] <Cork> a little, WAY back
[05:33:57] <Cork> i avoid java for anything except mobile now days
[05:34:23] <Cork> though it looks like even mobile starts to grow usable alternatives
[05:34:29] <norc_> Cork: That is probably the only decent approach to serving browsers with Java code. I guess in a way Java can be fine, but it just doesn't fit the modern style of "fastest release to market".
[05:34:46] <Cork> no there is no decent solution for serving java to browsers
[05:34:53] <Cork> it should just never happen; period
[05:35:11] <norc_> Being forced to spent 6 months writing interfaces, factories, exception handlers and type checks before you can implement any of your interfaces just doesn't help when you want something done in a reasonable amount of time.
[05:35:23] <norc_> Hehe
[05:35:47] <Cork> ya, let the visitor get all the headache instead...
[05:36:13] <norc_> Cork: Well I develop my applications in Ruby on Rails, though I suppose I should really take a look at ASP.NET :)
[05:36:23] <Cork> <_<'
[05:36:33] <Cork> you're really playing my tune huh...
[05:36:39] <norc_> Am I now?
[05:36:43] <Cork> <-- not a big fan of asp.net either :)
[05:36:54] <Cork> but that is cause it has really bad performance
[05:37:08] <norc_> Hehe. Well, Im a big fan of Visual Studio.
[05:37:19] <anew> Cork i cant use .getScript ?
[05:37:34] <Cork> anew: uh see my comment from like 30 mins ago...
[05:37:47] <Cork> "<Cork> another option is to just use $.getScript"
[05:37:58] <Cork> and the following effects of doing so
[05:38:19] <Cork> anew: though note, getScript won't solve your problem with document.write
[05:38:23] <anew> you mentioned using getScript, but then said after that since it's document.write "good luck"
[05:38:43] <Cork> anew: document.write has to run at document first parsing time
[05:38:53] <Cork> so you can't ever load the script async
[05:39:02] <Cork> it has to run blocking on the initial parser
[05:39:19] <Cork> or it will blow away the document as it executes (and some browsers block that)
[05:39:42] <anew> sigh
[05:39:43] <anew> ok
[05:40:06] <Cork> anew: have a look at the script your loading
[05:40:22] <Cork> if your lucky they might do something like document.write('<script....')
[05:40:32] <Cork> and then you could just load that url instead and that MIGHT work
[05:40:41] <anew> let me see
[05:40:58] <Cork> most ppl aren't stupid enough to actually use document.write except for generating script tags now days (and even that is quite stupid)
[05:41:15] <anew> yeah but then this whole passing the numbers thing screws everything up
[05:41:29] <anew> i wont tell the programmer your last comments :D :D :D
[05:41:33] <Cork> ya, the script is obviously not meant to be dynamically loaded
[05:42:13] <Cork> anew: the thing is there are modern way to do what they are trying to do without using document.write
[05:42:20] <Cork> and it isn't that hard to do it
[05:42:21] <anew> oh i agree
[05:42:25] <anew> this was probably written years ago
[05:42:37] <Cork> for example if you want "just add this script and the element will show up"
[05:42:49] <Cork> just give the script tag an id and inject the dom elements after it
[05:42:54] <Cork> and you've solved the problem
[05:43:06] <Cork> anew: one can always hope
[05:43:14] <Cork> i've seen ppl write it just a few days ago though so...
[05:43:47] <anew> lol
[05:43:52] <anew> ok iframe time
[05:43:59] <anew> this should work i hope
[05:44:06] <Cork> ya, it should
[05:44:06] <anew> or else jump out the window time
[05:44:20] <Cork> unless the script explicitly checks if it is loaded in an iframe
[05:44:24] <anew> oh lord
[05:44:29] <Cork> then... you're kinda screwed :)
[05:44:47] <anew> how can i see if the script is doing that
[05:44:57] <anew> before i even start...
[05:45:10] <Cork> you could search if it uses window.parent anywhere
[05:45:16] <Cork> or just parent
[05:45:37] <anew>  jQuery(this).parent().html(temp_var);
[05:45:40] <anew> has parent a couple times
[05:45:41] <Cork> no
[05:45:48] <Cork> just "parent" or "window.parent"
[05:45:51] <anew> ok
[05:45:52] <anew> ok then no
[05:45:55] <anew> ok i'll try then
[05:52:25] <anew> Cork if i load the script on page load, can i append the number to the script with jq after ? that should work?
[05:52:38] <anew> i just wouldnt knwo where to .append since i'd be appending to a url on the page
[05:52:40] <Cork> nope
[05:52:43] <anew> ffs
[05:52:50] <Cork> cause that will load the script without the number as load time
[05:53:10] <Cork> and then when you change the url it won't do anything (as a script tag can't load more then one script)
[05:53:22] <anew> ok
[05:58:16] <anew> the iframe actually produces an entire window...
[05:58:29] <anew> argh damn this is not possible
[05:58:35] <anew> because i will get that iframe  popup every time
[05:59:23] <Cork> you get a popup??
[06:01:01] <Cork> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/21j1bn69/
[06:01:35] <anew> http://pastebin.com/mNTzg1HS
[06:02:07] <Cork> you don't need to have the iframe in the page
[06:02:15] <Cork> so line 3 can be removed
[06:02:31] <Cork> check the fiddle for reference
[06:02:45] <Cork> also note the php needs to generate a full valid html page
[06:02:54] <Cork> includeing <html></html>
[06:03:24] <anew> line 3 is what appears after i do $('#lockercode').append
[06:03:31] <anew> with yours i get the popup also
[06:04:11] <Cork> you get a popup from the iframe?!?
[06:04:19] <Cork> or do you mean you get the scrollbar?
[06:05:29] <anew> you can see it appear on the page, the only difference with the css you added is that it disappears after 2 seconds
[06:14:50] <norc_> Cork: It seems like the amount of parallel XHR is an issue. Our IE11 seems to just stop working after 5 parallel XHR requests.
[06:15:13] <Cork> hmm, works fine here
[06:15:55] <norc_> Cork: Well, it could be the library still, but at least I have narrowed down the race condition. Somehow the amount affects the $.ajaxWrapper call.
[06:16:23] <norc_> Cork: and from what I have gathered, browsers seem to ahve builtin limits for concurrent XHR requests.
[06:16:32] <Cork> yes they do
[06:16:39] <Cork> to not ddos the servers
[06:17:46] <Cork> the limit differ a bit between browsers but it is usually between 6 and 8
[06:18:18] <norc_> Cork: Looks I need to shut this off for our domains then. I intentionally scaled our API server to handle several dozen requests simultaneously. :)
[06:18:57] <Cork> well you still need to handle dozens, just not from the same client
[06:20:05] <norc_> Cork: I do not expect for a single client to put out more than say 20 to the API, and 10 to another (totalling 30 from the client, and 20 for the API per client).
[06:20:25] <norc_> My server should be able to handle up to a hundred maybe
[06:20:34] <norc_> Which is enough for our use case.
[06:20:38] <Cork> ya a client won't make more then 10 simultaneous connections to the same ip at once
[06:20:44] <Cork> well rather the same domain name
[06:21:07] <Cork> and that includes loading html and img content
[06:21:07] <norc_> Cork: That fits the issue exactly actually.
[06:21:25] <norc_> Cork: And it must be IE specific (since FF and Chrome seem to be happy with 20 requests)
[06:21:35] <Cork> they will just queue them
[06:21:46] <Cork> firefox for example have a limit of 6 connections
[06:21:46] <norc_> Oh. That also explains the interface responsiveness.
[06:22:06] <Cork> so if you load 6 large images ajax won't run at all
[06:22:20] <norc_> Cork: The bizarre thing is that my XHR request gets resolved with a null object if it gets congested.
[06:22:23] <norc_> That shouldn't happen at all.
[06:22:40] <norc_> (Or rather the XHR promise gets resolved)
[06:22:46] <Cork> norc_: have you checked for a fail callback?
[06:23:13] <Cork> cause what i suspect is that you get a rejected request for some reason
[06:24:39] <norc_> Cork: I only use done/fail. The fail is not called but the done is called.
[06:24:47] <norc_> Let me check the network debugger.
[06:24:51] <Cork> hmm weird
[06:25:20] <Cork> norc_: that sounds like it might be a jquery bug actually
[06:25:33] <Cork> norc_: have you tried in a newer jquery version ? 1.11 for example?
[06:26:06] <norc_> Cork: Upgrading breaks this JS framework.
[06:26:18] <Cork> have you tried with jquery-migrate.js?
[06:26:45] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.js
[06:26:55] <norc_> Cork: Yeah.
[06:27:01] <Cork> hmm ouch...
[06:27:18] <norc_> Cork: It is a really badly written JS library with a total of 200,000 lines of code.
[06:28:04] <norc_> They even implemented SHA with nothing but string functions... really beautiful code.
[06:28:17] <Cork> <_<
[06:29:04] <Cork> think it sounds like a time for rewrite
[06:29:24] <Cork> java and badly written js, a splendid combination
[06:29:28] <norc_> Cork: It was purchased, so its not ours.
[06:29:58] <norc_> Cork: I mean the software itself is pretty neat and worth for what it does - but trying to extend it is horrible.
[06:30:24] <norc_> Cork: The whole reason Im writing my own JavaScript libraries, is because it allows me to add functionality to the websites without having to deal with any of the frameworks software stack.
[06:31:04] <norc_> All I need to do is trust that its event system calls my library in the right moment, and serve some velocity templates (which right now doesnt work nicely in IE11 as my problem demonstrates)
[06:42:38] <norc_> Cork: I suddenly noticed that the webserver actually returns for these queries. This is getting more bizarre with every moment.
[06:43:22] <norc_> Cork: It actually returns a null json object on these cases, although the request header and body are identical (except the user-agent of course) to the requests in Chrome/FF.
[06:43:33] <norc_> So its definitely that awesome software.
[06:43:55] <Cork> :)
[06:44:18] <Cork> time to stop blaming ie and start blaming ua sniffing ^
[06:44:21] <Cork> * ^^
[06:44:38] <norc_> Cork: My guess at this point is that it has in fact to do with concurrent XHR, that IE11 does not queue them (which the server cannot handle) - while FF and Chrome enqueue them (allowing the server to handle it)
[06:45:05] <Cork> norc_: no ie rate limit them too
[06:45:21] <Cork> i don't remember the rate limit for ie though
[06:46:01] <Cork> norc_: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/03/20/roundup-on-parallel-connections/
[06:46:15] <Cork> a bit old though...
[06:46:24] <Pazician> Cork: Shouldn't this work out? https://jsfiddle.net/56sqrL94/1/
[06:46:56] <Cork> Pazician: see my older answer
[06:47:11] <Cork> $() is not a "when it matches do"
[06:47:22] <Cork> it searches for elements and returns the one it found
[06:47:40] <Cork> so no, the last line won't ever execute as added isn't added on page load
[06:47:53] <Cork> also $(this) at the top isn't something you should use
[06:48:16] <Cork> but again, share the context your trying to use so we can help you with the real problem
[06:48:44] <Cork> instead of spending infinite time debugging a psudo problem that later won't match anything

[06:56:29] <daynaskully> did the .show and .hide change how it shows/hides? it use to fade in/out and now it does some fancy bouncy thing going from like 0 height
[06:58:20] <Cork> daynaskully: that line makes no sense
[06:58:26] <Cork> what are you asking?
[06:58:53] <daynaskully> .show and .hide uses some fancy effects when it never did before?
[06:58:54] <`ULT> hi cork, i see that you are using box-sizing for styling your checkboxes.
[06:59:10] <daynaskully> it swings in and boucnes by default
[06:59:21] <Cork> daynaskully: did you give them a number as the argument?
[06:59:23] <daynaskully> when before i remember it being simply fading
[06:59:28] <daynaskully> or visible on/off
[06:59:40] <`ULT> webkit and moz-box are not necessary?
[06:59:49] <daynaskully> just fast/slwo
[07:00:13] <Cork> `ULT: it is just to make the different browsers give the element the same size
[07:00:31] <Cork> but no it isn't necessary, but you prob want to keep it
[07:00:42] <`ULT> so just box-sizing is enough for the most browsers?
[07:00:51] <Cork> `ULT: i recommend just taking the example and run them in the different browsers and see how they change when you do
[07:01:06] <`ULT> okido thx
[07:01:11] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing#Browser_compatibility
[07:02:25] <Cork> so it depends on how much backwards compatibility you need you have to have
[07:03:16] <Cork> daynaskully: there shouldn't be any effects applied on show/hide by default
[07:03:29] <Cork> daynaskully: so check if you have a plugin that adds that
[07:19:02] <zumba_a__> good morning folks, what's the proper way to handle pending xhr request when api server is unreachable? My Chrome decides to set it as (failed) and net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE which jquery's .fail is failing to capture
[07:25:08] <Cork> zumba_a__: uh .fail should fire just fine
[07:25:19] <Cork> you can't catch the exception though
[07:25:23] <Cork> if that is what you mean
[07:25:27] <zumba_a__> for me, it doesn't go inside it
[07:25:31] <Cork> just check if the xhr.status == 0
[07:25:42] <Cork> it should work just fine
[07:26:01] <zumba_a__> so maybe, the deferred that our backbone is using is wrong
[07:26:14] <zumba_a__> i mean backbonejs
[07:26:33] <zumba_a__> we are using this.item.fetch().done(function() { ..})
[07:26:46] <zumba_a__> and I added .fail at the end
[07:27:42] <zumba_a__> this is how i'm doing the testing Cork
[07:28:13] <Cork> it might be something in there code that breaks
[07:28:33] <Cork> but ya $.ajax().done().fail(function(xhr) { if(xhr.status == 0) {} }); works fine
[07:28:51] <zumba_a__> we have a carousel that makes a call to the api every 20 seconds. So I disconnect my vpn so that our fetch call will fail. On the network tab, it will show as pending for 2 mins. Chrome then will mark it as failed with ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE
[07:28:55] <Cork> actaully helped someone with that the other day
[07:29:14] <zumba_a__> i don't have xhr.status though
[07:29:19] <zumba_a__> i'll add it
[07:29:25] <Cork> well if you don't have it you should get all errors
[07:29:38] <zumba_a__> it's not spitting anything out
[07:29:43] <Cork> it is just to filter out specifically when the server couldn't be reached
[07:29:47] <zumba_a__> k
[07:29:52] <zumba_a__> so my code should work
[07:30:20] <zumba_a__> i'm really not sure why it's not using the .fail
[07:30:28] <zumba_a__> been troubelshooting it for almost 2 days now
[07:31:22] <zumba_a__> ah, i have an idea
[07:31:44] <zumba_a__> i'll comment out the existing code and use $.ajax directly inside that function being called
[07:31:53] <`ULT> hi cork, i see that you have used  font-family: FontAwesome; as font.
[07:32:30] <`ULT> is it possible to use this: http://fontawesome.io/icon/check-square/ as the inside (content) of the checkbox instead of the x
[07:32:51] <`ULT> <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>
[07:32:53] <Cork> `ULT: sure that is what i use actually
[07:33:02] <`ULT> yeah i thougth that :p
[07:33:03] <`ULT> nice
[07:33:04] <Cork> just set the content: to the value from there css
[07:33:12] <Cork> and your set
[07:33:44] <`ULT> you mean instead of x > <i class="fa fa-check-square"></i>
[07:33:52] <Cork> no
[07:33:55] <Cork> https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.css
[07:34:02] <Cork> look for "fa-check-square"
[07:34:20] <Cork> then copy the content: "<something not printable>" from there
[07:34:21] <`ULT> nice, i didnt know that.
[07:34:22] <Cork> and your done
[07:34:27] <`ULT> thank you!
[07:34:40] <Cork> np
[07:34:53] <zumba_a__> Cork, I've commented our code and trying $.ajax call now :)
[07:35:04] <zumba_a__> i'm going to simulate the same scenario
[07:36:02] <zumba_a__> my $.ajax call is working. Now disconnecting vpn and see if .fail will capture it
[07:36:37] <zumba_a__> it's now showing as pending in network tab of crhome dev tools
[07:37:58] <zumba_a__> still showing as pending
[07:38:38] <zumba_a__> ok, finally gave up I see the first pending as (failed) in network tab
[07:38:48] <zumba_a__> yes, you are right
[07:38:58] <zumba_a__> i see my failed message in console
[07:39:14] <zumba_a__> so why in the other code, .fail is not working? :(
[07:40:28] <Cork> zumba_a__: prob cause backbone is doing something that loses that info
[07:40:36] <zumba_a__> k
[07:40:41] <Cork> can't help you there haven't used backbone much
[07:40:58] <zumba_a__> yup, it's good that jquery is doing it correctly
[08:04:48] <Shadow> Hi how can I use this $('#results').data('searchcounty'); to set the dropdown value that has a select id="countyLocation"
[08:13:28] <Guest1000000> Hello.

[08:19:55] <anew> hey stupid question... when i create an iframe with jquery, that's going to show something is loading in the top tab of the browser correct
[08:21:18] <anew> ok looks like the entire page doesnt reload, but the iframe has to load, why does this show in the browser, but doing an ajax call doesnt for example?
[08:59:32] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/vqjm0xjx/
[08:59:38] <anew> saying r.ip here is not definied, any ideas ?
[09:02:25] <anew> bracket problem nvmnd
[09:20:04] <anew> Cork are you there, last question and i'm done
[09:20:51] <anew> i called the iframe and appended the number... but inside the iframe there is a call_locker(); code.... when i run that after callign the iframe, it says call_locker is not defined
[09:28:20] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/j30esory/1/
[09:28:22] <anew> here
[09:28:37] <anew> line 23 ... it is saying call_locker is not defined
[09:31:39] <VectorX> hi i got this html <div class="the-sign main-content"></div> <div class="the-sign main-text"></div>  i want to get the entire class name when it starts with 'main-' for this ?
[09:31:49] <VectorX> ie on click
[09:34:07] <anew> can anyone help with that
[09:34:23] <VectorX> so if this clicked i need to get the text "main-text" in a var
[09:34:41] <robertmaxrees> anew is that function defined in the iframe?
[09:35:12] <robertmaxrees> beacause basically http://stackoverflow.com/questions/251420/invoking-javascript-code-in-an-iframe-from-the-parent-page
[09:35:40] <anew> robertmaxrees, yes it's in the iframe
[09:35:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then check out the SO article.
[09:35:54] <robertmaxrees> the iframe exists in a different document.
[09:35:55] <anew> but the parent and iframe are both the same domain
[09:35:57] <anew> so it should work?
[09:36:07] <anew> no
[09:36:10] <robertmaxrees> domain doesn't matter in this case.
[09:36:15] <anew> arghhhh
[09:36:34] <anew> man
[09:40:17] <anew> window.frames['name'] actually it looks like i can do it with this? i sthat correct robertmaxrees  ?
[09:47:17] <anew> document.getElementById('myframe1').contentWindow.call_locker();
[09:47:22] <anew> same thing, get that it is not a function...
[09:47:55] <robertmaxrees> so you only have one #myframe1 in the page?
[09:48:11] <anew> yes...
[09:49:05] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="myframe1"]').length);
[09:49:08] <robertmaxrees> try this after appending the iframe.
[09:49:22] <robertmaxrees> what do you get in the console?
[09:49:32] <anew> 1
[09:49:34] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[09:49:43] <anew> :'(
[09:49:46] <robertmaxrees> then the function is not available in that scope.  dunno what to tell you.
[09:49:52] <robertmaxrees> where to do define call_locker?
[09:49:53] <anew> motherf.....
[09:49:58] <robertmaxrees> is it in a document ready or something?
[09:50:33] <anew> in the iframe, i have <script/> with the source file that has call_locker in it
[09:51:05] <robertmaxrees> and if you directly load the iframe source, you can access that function in your console?
[09:51:35] <anew> what do you mean by 'directly load'?  but yes after the iframe loads, i see the <script/> with the src js file
[09:51:55] <robertmaxrees> you're setting a url for the iframe source - hit that url.
[09:52:07] <anew> k
[09:55:15] <anew> weird... when i have $('<iframe>', { src: '/iframe.php', css: { display: 'none' } }).appendTo('#lockercode'); it appears... but when i do $('<iframe id="myframe1"> ', { src: '/iframe.php', css: { display: 'none' } }).appendTo('#lockercode');
[09:55:16] <anew> it doesnt
[09:55:59] <anew> does that make any sense...
[09:56:00] <robertmaxrees> $('<iframe id="myframe1"> ', { - try killing that space.
[09:56:09] <robertmaxrees> $('<iframe id="myframe1">', {
[09:56:52] <anew> https://jsfiddle.net/suxuq10u/
[09:56:56] <anew> top works bottom does now
[09:57:12] <robertmaxrees> does or does not?
[09:57:41] <anew> on my link, the top one works (iframe appears) when i do line 3 the iframe does not appear
[09:58:43] <robertmaxrees> you're reloading the page before trying to run the second one, right?
[09:59:22] <daynaskully> {Q} when using $("someclass").append(some-hidden-element-id); how can i stop it from removing the original element?
[09:59:46] <robertmaxrees> clone it first.
[09:59:53] <robertmaxrees> but that would make an invalid page.
[09:59:59] <robertmaxrees> give that element a class instead.
[10:00:14] <daynaskully> ahh clone, nice. and yea i'll use a parent selector with child element/class
[10:00:22] <robertmaxrees> uh
[10:00:31] <robertmaxrees> but the element won't have that id, right?
[10:00:37] <robertmaxrees> you cna't have the same ID more than once on a page.
[10:00:55] <daynaskully> the id was only for getting the particular element, but if i wrap it with <div id=whatever><element></div> i can go whatever > element
[10:01:07] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[10:02:07] <anew> hey sorry was in the bathroom let me read
[10:02:23] <anew> is that for me? give the iframe a class?
[10:02:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:02:34] <anew> what do you mean reaload the page, the iframe loads on its own
[10:02:37] <robertmaxrees> my last message to you was " you're reloading the page before trying to run the second one, right?"
[10:02:46] <robertmaxrees> you're not trying to append the iframe twice, right?
[10:02:59] <robertmaxrees> like test the first one, reload the parent parent, test the second one?
[10:03:39] <anew> no just once
[10:03:44] <anew> ah
[10:03:45] <anew> no
[10:03:51] <anew> i'm testing the first one seperatly
[10:03:54] <anew> first one iframe appears
[10:04:09] <robertmaxrees> dunno thgen.  no console errors or anything?
[10:04:26] <anew> for the iframe... no... only says call_locker is not a function
[10:04:50] <robertmaxrees> for the parent window
[10:05:22] <anew> nope nothing
[10:05:52] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.  i'd have to see it running.
[10:08:51] <anew> argh
[10:13:02] <anew> yeah this makes no sense
[10:13:06] <anew> as soon as i add id=""
[10:13:08] <anew> it stops appearing
[10:13:17] <robertmaxrees> when you inspect element?
[10:13:19] <robertmaxrees> or just in the page?
[10:13:43] <anew> when i inspect element
[10:13:50] <anew> the iframe appears, but everythign inside does not
[10:14:04] <robertmaxrees> wonky.
[10:14:05] <anew> when i have only <iframe> contents appear, when i have <iframe id=""> it's empty
[10:14:14] <anew> let me try class for the hell of it
[10:16:02] <anew> yeah.ntohing
[10:16:03] <anew> the f
[10:16:14] <robertmaxrees> what if you do it using normal string syntax.
[10:16:19] <robertmaxrees> instead of the object props setup?
[10:16:23] <robertmaxrees> or set the id using the object?
[10:16:25] <anew> what's normal string?
[10:17:10] <robertmaxrees> $('<iframe id="myframe1" src="iframe.php"').appendTo('#lockercode');
[10:17:48] <shoky> anew: from here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes   Important: If the second argument is passed, the HTML string in the first argument must represent a simple element with no attributes.
[10:18:03] <robertmaxrees> hah, that would do it.
[10:18:35] <anew> oh
[10:18:43] <anew> so i should do what u just wrote then robertmaxrees
[10:18:59] <robertmaxrees> or ditch the id attribute and put it in the object.
[10:27:04] <anew> man having two older sisters is a fkn nightmare
[10:27:06] <anew> ok let me change this
[10:28:25] <anew>  src: '/iframe.php' so i should change this to src: var
[10:28:26] <anew> ?
[10:31:30] <anew> damn no didnt work either
[10:31:43] <anew> neither did $('<iframe id="myframe1" src="iframe.php"').appendTo('#lockercode');
[10:33:41] <shoky> anew: you're missing a > there
[10:33:56] <anew> oh
[10:33:56] <anew> duh
[10:34:02] <daynaskully> when i'm using $('items').each and want to select the first item, should i use a counter or put an $(item).first before my each?
[10:34:03] <anew> shoky you been in this room for years lol
[10:34:09] <shoky> ;p
[10:34:26] <NoiseEee> daynaskully: yeah just take the .first()
[10:34:32] <anew> ok iframe is there with the id, fingers crossed the rest will work
[10:34:39] <NoiseEee> daynaskully: and obv. then you don't need the each
[10:35:09] <daynaskully> well i still want to do some stuff within each, but only a single additional thing to the first item
[10:35:26] <anew> no.. stil... Uncaught TypeError: el.contentWindow.call_locker is not a function
[10:35:28] <daynaskully> just wondering what was the best way
[10:35:43] <NoiseEee> well then daynaskully, no, the .first() will automatically reduce the jquery object to a single item
[10:35:49] <NoiseEee> daynaskully: you'd have to count.

[10:37:31] <anew> here
[10:37:50] <anew> and getting call_locker is not a function
[10:38:08] <anew> code is there in the frame i can see it
[10:38:25] <NoiseEee> anew: does "iframe.php" have a global JS function called call_locker?
[10:38:49] <zumba_a__> folks, I found the code that changed our fetch. I knew it, it was prototype. However, I'm not sure if something is wrong with this code but I can guarantee that the .fail isn't working - http://pastebin.com/13E9ZHrq
[10:38:58] <anew> yes because i can use call_locker if i put the contents of iframe.php directly on the page NoiseEee
[10:39:23] <NoiseEee> "put the contents of iframe.php directly on the page", what does that mean anew?
[10:39:48] <NoiseEee> anew: as now, you're calling the function "call_locker()" in the iframe.php document
[10:40:00] <anew> NoiseEee, i mean, inside iframe.php there is <script>http://js.com/code</script>... that's the only thing in it
[10:40:17] <anew> if i put <script>http://js.com/code</script> on the primarey? page everything works fine
[10:40:19] <anew> call_locker works
[10:40:37] <zumba_a__> Cork: hopefully you can help me
[10:41:59] <NoiseEee> anew: so you;re saying that the iframe.php page DOES have a global function called call_locker available?
[10:42:04] <NoiseEee> anew: pasting real code would be helpful
[10:42:34] <NoiseEee> anew: but keep in mind that just because you've appended an iframe to your document, it doesn't mean the document in the iframe has been completely loaded right away
[10:42:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:42:55] <NoiseEee> anew: in other words, make sure the iframe document has loaded before you go tryign to do things with it / call methods it has
[10:43:05] <anew> how do i make sure it's loaded before i move to the 'next step' ?
[10:44:23] <NoiseEee> give it a callback when you create it, perhaps... try the third demo in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12267010/how-can-i-detect-whether-an-iframe-is-loaded
[10:49:51] <anew> could i check if the div exists? if it does continue, if not wait 500ms ?
[10:49:57] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea
[10:50:12] <robertmaxrees> use .load()
[10:52:26] <DarkSector> Why are my links being autoclicked?
[10:52:32] <anew> bots
[10:52:36] <DarkSector> I have them in document.ready()
[10:52:43] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[10:53:11] <DarkSector> Okay
[10:54:51] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/bjn4eaj6/ how do i rewrite the top to the bottom so i can see if the iframe is loaded
[10:55:11] <daynaskully> {Q} how can i pull a specific class value off of an element? so if i have <img class="class1 class2 index-of-3 class4"> and want to grab "index-of-x" where x could be any digit and do some stuff based on what x is
[10:55:30] <daynaskully> or should i use a data-attribute?
[10:55:54] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes
[10:56:10] <anew> actually i just put in a setimeout... still getting the not a function
[10:56:13] <anew> just to test..
[10:57:06] <robertmaxrees> anew lol timeouts are never the answer ;) if you load the iframe source as a window and run that function from the console, things work, right?
[10:57:25] <anew> what do you mean source as a window?
[10:57:32] <robertmaxrees> already explained this earlier:
[10:57:44] <robertmaxrees> take the src for the iframe, load that in a window.
[10:58:12] <anew> src of the iframe, when i put it on the base page (or however you call it) call_locker works
[10:58:18] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/w4nhzh27/1/
[10:58:25] <DarkSector> It just triggers the methdos
[10:58:28] <robertmaxrees> okay, then it's either CORS or something else, anew
[10:58:41] <anew> it cant be cors because i'm loading an iframe...
[10:58:48] <robertmaxrees> anew iframes are subject to cors.
[10:58:57] <robertmaxrees> DarkGhost what methdos?
[10:58:58] <robertmaxrees> *methods
[10:59:03] <robertmaxrees> fff, DarkSector
[10:59:03] <anew> hmm that's not what Cork told me earlier
[10:59:17] <anew> and if it was a cors issue it would say in console... this just says call_locker doesnt exist
[10:59:17] <robertmaxrees> if you're trying to access the contents of the iframe, you're subject to cors.
[10:59:22] <DarkSector> robertmaxrees, nextPageLink.click(console.log("next clicked"));
[10:59:22] <DarkSector>             previousPageLink.click(console.log("previous clicked"));
[10:59:38] <DarkSector> I was under the impression click() registers a listener
[10:59:44] <robertmaxrees> DarkSector because .click() wants a reference to a function
[10:59:49] <Uhkis> im sure Cork did not say that
[10:59:54] <anew> iframe is a totall new page
[10:59:59] <anew> Cork is the one who told me to do all this
[11:00:18] <robertmaxrees> DarkSector you're running the console.log and assigning its return to the event binding.
[11:00:23] <DarkSector> robertmaxrees, oh so it has to be click(function(){console.log('foo')})
[11:00:25] <robertmaxrees> thats why you see the logs on pageload.
[11:00:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:00:31] <DarkSector> oooh
[11:00:34] <DarkSector> okay, TIL
[11:00:43] <robertmaxrees> or console.log.bind(this, 'foo')
[11:01:25] <DarkSector> very cool
[11:01:38] <mellybean> Hey guys, I'm trying to add a new line character in an HTML attribute, but it looks like all the whitespace is getting stripped in set.Attribute : http://jsfiddle.net/TzVd3/421/ anyone know how one would do that?
[11:02:53] <DarkSector> robertmaxrees, another question I had was regarding the scope. I have getNext() in my <a> but it can't seem to find it
[11:02:54] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/w4nhzh27/3/
[11:03:11] <robertmaxrees> 2 things:
[11:03:16] <robertmaxrees> 1: onclick is bad mkay
[11:03:19] <DarkSector> ok
[11:03:40] <robertmaxrees> 2: getNext() is looking in the global scope.  you define getNext() within a function.
[11:03:49] <robertmaxrees> functions have scope - you can't "reach" a child scope.
[11:03:53] <robertmaxrees> but you can reach a parent scope.
[11:03:53] <DarkSector> I also tried window.getNext = function(){}
[11:03:59] <DarkSector> It couldn't find it
[11:04:01] <robertmaxrees> so use .on() to handle your event bindings instead.
[11:04:06] <DarkSector> gotcha
[11:07:05] <sistemas02> hello  I am having trouble creating a draggable interface using a symfony table
[11:08:44] <daynaskully> for doing $(element).each which changes dynamically; how can i bind that properly to gave a $(this).on click for the child elements?
[11:09:20] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead, daynaskully
[11:09:53] <sistemas02> can this be done:  <td id="draggable{{ iteraProducto.id }}">
[11:10:40] <robertmaxrees> sistemas02 do what now?
[11:10:41] <DarkSector> robertmaxrees, why can't I access variables defined with window? https://jsfiddle.net/w4nhzh27/9/
[11:10:48] <DarkSector> What am I doing wrong?
[11:11:03] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[11:11:19] <DarkSector> robertmaxrees, when I run my script
[11:11:25] <robertmaxrees> window.previousPageLink = $("#previouspagelink"); why are you doing those outside of the document ready?
[11:11:27] <sistemas02> robertmaxrees  I am trying to make a td draggable to a sidebar.
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> the elements don't exist yet, DarkSector
[11:11:42] <DarkSector> Oh right, sorry, I forgot to fix that
[11:11:42] <robertmaxrees> sistemas02 can you make a fiddle or something to replicate?
[11:11:49] <DarkSector> Initially I had defined it within document.ready()
[11:11:54] <DarkSector> but I still can't seem to access those
[11:11:56] <robertmaxrees> DarkSector and don't put those on window
[11:12:16] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/w4nhzh27/10/
[11:12:28] <DarkSector> So should I define them in $ scope?
[11:12:41] <DarkSector> Because I want them to be accessible from everywhere
[11:12:41] <robertmaxrees> just define them in that function.
[11:12:45] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[11:12:55] <robertmaxrees> explicitly pass data around instead.
[11:13:20] <sistemas02> not sure how it interacts with symfony2
[11:13:37] <robertmaxrees> sistemas02 is your question about jquery or symfony2?
[11:13:50] <robertmaxrees> because jquery doesn't care about the backend - just the rendered markup.
[11:13:53] <sistemas02> jquery interaccion with symfony in ids
[11:13:59] <sistemas02> ahhh
[11:14:01] <sistemas02> ok
[11:14:02] <sistemas02> thanks
[11:16:54] <daynaskully> robertmaxrees:: an example of what i have basically; not sure how to delegate this guy http://jsfiddle.net/6k8ysh66/
[11:17:00] <daynaskully> note the 3rd item wont be clickable
[11:17:20] <robertmaxrees> right... that's why you use delegation ;)
[11:17:31] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried for delegating that listener?
[11:18:08] <daynaskully> i'm not sure how, i know how to do it for specific id/classes that are known, but clueless in this case tbh
[11:18:17] <robertmaxrees> $('#stuff2click').on('click', 'li', function() {
[11:18:25] <daynaskully> lol
[11:18:26] <daynaskully> oh
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6k8ysh66/1/
[11:18:33] * daynaskully shoots face
[11:18:34] <robertmaxrees> that's a delegated listener.
[11:18:44] <robertmaxrees> notice the second selector in therE?
[11:18:52] <daynaskully> yep
[11:18:56] <daynaskully> total face palm
[11:35:22] <anew> Cork u there ?
[11:35:52] <shoky> anew he's not usually here at these hours
[11:36:00] <anew> ah ok will try tomorrow morning
[11:36:05] <anew> i guess this iframe thing is not going to work
[11:36:06] <robertmaxrees> why not just ask the channel?
[11:36:23] <anew> well he was explaining to me about the iframes in the morning, maybe i'm doing what he explained wrong
[11:36:24] <robertmaxrees> also: what if you try your code in the console?
[11:36:41] <anew> if i type call_locker(); in console it says undefined
[11:36:46] <anew> (after i call the iframe)
[11:37:41] <shoky> in console you can choose the context frame which the console is running in (most convenient in chrome)
[11:37:52] <robertmaxrees> you have to call it "through" the iframe like we explained earlier.
[11:37:55] <sebbers_> is it possible to render the source of a backend script (php,java, c#) file inside a panel of a chrome extension? the idea would be to continue debugging in the dev tools extension without having to revert back to the source ide(intellij, visual studios, etc)? is there a term to describe that sort of feature like "server side source rendering"?
[11:38:13] <robertmaxrees> sebe now without shipping the source code to the browser.
[11:38:19] <robertmaxrees> which might not be the best idea ever.
[11:39:23] <anew> wow that's crazy i never knew that... so when i chose #myframe1 (the iframe) and type in call_locker();
[11:39:27] <anew> it still says undefined
[11:39:28] <sebbers_> so basically the site would need to have an api that sends it text of its source?
[11:39:30] <anew> :facepalm:
[11:39:32] <robertmaxrees> anew so there you go.
[11:39:51] <robertmaxrees> sebbers_ think real hard about why that might not be the best idea though :)
[11:40:01] <shoky> anew and what if you just type call_locker
[11:40:01] <anew> but i dont get it, i see the code in the iframe
[11:40:12] <anew> ah... o
[11:40:15] <shoky> o
[11:40:18] <anew> ok shoky if i type in call_locker yes
[11:40:25] <sebbers_> the server side code could render malicious code?
[11:40:30] <shoky> anew what does call_locker return?
[11:40:38] <anew> so if i am in iframe in console, i type in call_locker it returns function call_locker()
[11:41:13] <shoky> what does the function call_locker return?
[11:41:40] <anew> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://url.com/script_include.php?id=344725&tracking_id=4340"></script>
[11:41:41] <anew> this
[11:41:59] <shoky> it returns that? as a string?
[11:42:17] <anew> eh when i click call_locker in console that's what i see
[11:42:44] <shoky> not asking about clicks, just what the function actually is coded to return
[11:42:50] <shoky> like... return 5;
[11:43:40] <anew> eh dunno, it calls something inside that script which is what i'm trying to access
[11:43:57] <shoky> anyway, is there a problem now?
[11:44:33] <anew> well in console call_locker works, but https://jsfiddle.net/w8vabq8p/ this whole thing doesnt work
[11:45:01] <cfolgar> trying to change the value of a select control is a lot harder than I thought. it could be that Im new to js.
[11:45:04] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?  have you tried console logging/etc.
[11:45:05] <shoky> are you waiting for the frame to be loaded?
[11:45:28] <cfolgar> I can change the value of the select, but ti doesnt change the html :(
[11:45:53] <shoky> cfolgar html is not meant to change, so that's good
[11:46:18] <shoky> the runtime value of the select should still be changed, so that's good too
[11:49:47] <cfolgar> what if I actually want to change the value that the user sees in the select box once an event happens? right now, I want to make it such that if they click a button, the value of the select box goes back to the default option and value.
[11:50:10] <cfolgar> i cant get that to happen in js. i can only get the underlying value to change, but to the user, it still looks like nothing happened.
[11:50:22] <cfolgar> this is bad for my particular UX
[11:50:36] <cfolgar> so Im just wondering how I can accomplish this in js.
[11:52:39] <robertmaxrees> .val()
[11:52:47] <robertmaxrees> unless you're trying to actually modify things.
[11:52:51] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[11:54:33] <shoky> cfolgar here's an example for ya  http://jsfiddle.net/5anr10zy/
[12:01:25] <Crendel>  Is it possible to use a single bloodhound instance for different queries ?
[12:02:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean for different search boxes?
[12:02:49] <robertmaxrees> because i don't se why not.
[12:03:24] <Crendel> Yea like say the objects in my array were {name, age,address} and i was using typeahead each input box would only search using the the key i want instead of making 3 seperate bloodhound instances
[12:03:39] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to do that.
[12:04:11] <Crendel> reading the bloodhound docs and the ket seems to be set on the init of the bloodhound object so not sure how
[12:04:16] <Crendel> key*
[12:04:38] <robertmaxrees> "the key"?
[12:04:48] <fas3r> hello
[12:05:07] <Crendel> datumTokenizer
[12:05:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, that
[12:05:55] <fas3r> when using : Child Selector (“parent > child”), does child have to be the first child element of the parent ?
[12:05:57] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of any way to work around that.
[12:06:06] <robertmaxrees> fas3r it can only be "one level" deep.
[12:06:14] <jsk> Hi, I'm having a hard time searching for this but I thought that this was legal and encouraged. It returns [] to me, what am I doing wrong? $('<div></div>').find('div')
[12:06:24] <Crendel> So the normal approach would be creating 3 seperate bloodhound objects ?
[12:06:26] <robertmaxrees> jsk there's no child div there.
[12:06:31] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: should I prefer find in that case ?
[12:06:31] <robertmaxrees> Crendel in that case, yes.
[12:06:47] <robertmaxrees> fas3r i favor .find() always.
[12:07:13] <fas3r> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:07:47] <Crendel> Also say i have var arr = some large array; and then when i initalize bloodhound i link it as local: arr. If i creating multiple bloodhound instances is the arr getting copied or is it being accessed by reference ?
[12:08:01] <robertmaxrees> reference.
[12:08:24] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: stupid question, can find have more than one selector ?
[12:08:34] <robertmaxrees> fas3r it can take a selector, yes.
[12:08:35] <jsk> robertmaxrees: yes, thank you, I was thinking of filter. Remove() works like find and I have no top level parent. Ideas?
[12:08:40] <robertmaxrees> so anything you can pass to $()
[12:08:51] <robertmaxrees> jsk what are you trying to accomplish?
[12:09:45] <jsk> i have html response like '<div id="one">..</div></div id="two">..</div>' and want to remove "one"
[12:09:51] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[12:10:18] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i'd highly suggest modifying that response to have a single root node.
[12:10:24] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to have nothing but headaches.
[12:10:27] <fas3r> jsk: are you using load or html to render an ajax answer ?
[12:11:01] <jsk> fas3r: yes
[12:11:24] <jsk> robertmaxrees: unfortunately i'm not able to modify that
[12:11:39] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:11:45] <robertmaxrees> whoever is in charge of it should.
[12:11:53] <fas3r> so just after loading the ajax html content ( response), do $('#div1').remove() .
[12:12:52] <robertmaxrees> use .filter in that case.
[12:13:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/06pgfnb3/
[12:14:21] <jsk> i don't disagree
[12:14:24] <jsk> :)
[12:14:40] <jsk> yes i just got something like that working. thanks for your help robertmaxrees  fas3r
[12:15:03] <robertmaxrees> generally you would avoid having a response like that fwiw.
[12:19:50] <daynaskully> i'm trying to select an element based on a specific data-attribute (in order to get a separate attribute from that element, but it's not working) http://jsfiddle.net/s571r393/
[12:20:36] <robertmaxrees> avoid selecting on data attributes.
[12:21:31] <daynaskully> oh, i was missing div[data-my-id
[12:22:55] <zumba_a__> .then is also for successful promise right?
[12:23:19] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[12:23:35] <zumba_a__> k
[12:24:01] <zumba_a__> i'm thinking of changing our .done to .then because our .fail isn't executing
[12:24:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:24:19] <robertmaxrees> use .done() for successful requests.
[12:24:30] <zumba_a__> we are using it this way
[12:24:45] <zumba_a__> we updated our backbonejs fetch to use Jquery deferred
[12:25:05] <zumba_a__> so this.item.fetch().done(function() { }).fail(function() {});
[12:25:27] <zumba_a__> when something fails, it doesn't go to .fail
[12:25:48] <robertmaxrees> what does .fetch() return?
[12:25:54] <zumba_a__> a promise
[12:26:00] <robertmaxrees> and how are you defining a "fail"?
[12:26:18] <zumba_a__> i used it like the above code
[12:26:35] <zumba_a__> .fail(function(error) {console.log(error) })
[12:26:48] <zumba_a__> with native $.ajax and .fail, it worked
[12:26:54] <shoky> using a deferred/promise doesn't automatically give you a .fail condition
[12:27:02] <shoky> $.ajax does
[12:27:09] <zumba_a__> this is what we have in the code, http://pastebin.com/HueaXZFP
[12:27:20] <zumba_a__> oh
[12:27:39] <zumba_a__> i've spent 2 days now trying to fix this issue but unsuccessful
[12:28:20] <shoky> maybe that Backbone.Model.prototype.fetch  thing doesn't have a fail condition, doesn't reject the deferred
[12:28:25] <shoky> who knows
[12:28:29] <zumba_a__> k
[12:28:40] <zumba_a__> the fetch is a very simple code
[12:29:02] <shoky> we can take a look at very simple code, if you want..
[12:29:55] <zumba_a__> our fetch that calls it?
[12:30:05] <zumba_a__> or backbone's fetch?
[12:30:25] <shoky> Backbone.Model.prototype.fetch
[12:30:42] <shoky> the one that actually resolves or rejects the deferred
[12:30:49] <zumba_a__> ok one sec
[12:32:05] <zumba_a__> http://pastebin.com/FLZH2QJ0
[12:32:16] <zumba_a__> I copied that from backbone.js
[12:32:38] <shoky> thought you said it's very simple ;)
[12:32:48] <shoky> that's hardly enough to figure out what it's actually doing
[12:32:49] <zumba_a__> oh, i'm sorry
[12:32:53] <zumba_a__> i meant short
[12:32:56] <shoky> this is a backbone question
[12:32:59] <shoky> wrong channel sir
[12:33:02] <zumba_a__> k
[12:34:00] <zumba_a__> what would be the proper question to backbone? Does fetch have a fail condition
[12:34:52] <shoky> i guess.. or does it ever reject the provided deferred. (which would cause .fail to be called)
[12:35:10] <shoky> not that this question alone will help you solve anything ;)
[12:37:12] <jak2016> is possible export a Html Table to excel?
[12:45:05] <Es0teric> how do i reference multiple div IDs that will reference the same method?
[12:45:11] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[12:45:19] <NoiseEee> jak2016: copy and paste
[12:45:53] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i want to reference #packages-lg, #packages-sm, #packages-xs, #packages-grid because all of them use .selectize()
[12:47:05] <zumba_a__> thanks shoky
[12:49:00] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ?
[12:49:36] <robertmaxrees> $('#packages-lg, #packages-sm, #packages-xs, #packages-grid');
[12:49:39] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[12:51:04] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees would that actually work?
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> i dunno.
[12:51:53] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot!
[12:52:12] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/tHHcAni3
[12:52:13] <Es0teric> doesnt work
[12:52:21] <Es0teric> it doesnt display the input fields as it should
[12:52:23] <robertmaxrees> one string.
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> not many.
[12:52:29] <robertmaxrees> $('#packages-lg, #packages-sm, #packages-xs, #packages-grid');
[12:54:31] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well that works but it doesnt trigger the js as it would when its a single ID
[12:54:59] <robertmaxrees> then selectize probably isn't running an each under the hood.
[12:58:22] <cfolgar> whats the point of calling a function in js script by doing: $(myFunc) as opposed to myFunc()
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> document ready
[12:58:37] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/BGR1Jq0p
[12:58:48] <robertmaxrees> passing a function to $() is shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[12:59:02] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric make a fiuddle.
[13:02:24] <Crendel> Hi i have a twtter typeahead question .
[13:02:27] <Crendel> I know it has a templating option and multiple datasets  but if i have an object array with { name, state } do i have i have to make an array for each each state in order to have the state show as the header for a group of objects that belong to that state ?
[13:05:14] <cfolgar> question: sometimes I see people use myItem.disabled = True and other times I see $('#myItemId').prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[13:05:25] <cfolgar> which is preferred and why?
[13:05:32] <cfolgar> they seem to do the same thing no?
[13:05:47] <robertmaxrees> the second creates a whole new jquery object to lug around.
[13:05:51] <robertmaxrees> depends on the codebase.
[13:10:03] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah my problem now is that selectize wont work on multiple input fields in the same page
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/
[13:10:31] <robertmaxrees> seems to work here just fine.
[13:11:15] <Crendel> anyone know ?
[13:11:18] <Es0teric> yeah but it doesnt work for me, robertmaxrees
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[13:11:24] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:18:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/ovxqkwom/
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:20:03] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i selected jquery
[13:20:06] <Es0teric> why does it not work
[13:21:30] <robertmaxrees> doesn't like the plugin name for some reason.
[13:21:45] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees so how am i supposed to fiddle it?
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> look at your network console.
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> the issue is not jquery
[13:25:24] <jak2016> NoiseEee other technique?
[13:26:17] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well its loading it correctly from rawgit
[13:26:23] <Es0teric> unless rawgit is the problem
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric that error in the console means the plugin is not loading.
[13:26:41] <robertmaxrees> dunno what else to tell you.
[13:35:27] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/ovxqkwom/2/
[13:35:30] <Es0teric> there we go
[13:35:31] <Es0teric> that should work fine
[13:35:37] <Es0teric> so what would the problem be?
[13:46:43] <Crendel> is it bad to do for(obj in objects){ obj = objects[obj]; //work with obj } ?
[13:47:10] <Crendel> where objects is an object
[13:55:48] <andrew9183> that’s fine, but why would you alias it to obj
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> also, for...in is kind of a funky thing to begin with.
[14:08:40] <Crendel> anyone good with bloodhound ?
[14:09:57] <robertmaxrees> there's a #bloodhound
[14:10:14] <Crendel> :o thanks then
[14:10:31] <Crendel> well
[14:10:40] <Crendel> is that twitter bloodhound ?
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the twitter thing.
[14:11:15] <robertmaxrees> that channels probably for the apache project.
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[14:13:27] <Crendel> yea i have array of objects { name, state} and wondering if i have to create seperate bloodhound objects and seperate typeahead objects in order to have the Type ahead show template have the state as its header
[14:13:50] <Crendel> and if i have to seperate my dataset
[14:14:06] <Crendel> Example of this being http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#custom-templates
[14:14:11] <Crendel> the Muiltiple dataset example
[14:15:01] <Crendel> excpet my dataset isn't seperated
[14:17:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:17:15] <robertmaxrees> you want to reuse the same template?
[14:17:28] <Crendel> do you see there example
[14:17:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[14:18:33] <Crendel> And how they use the template object to have the NHL and NBA header
[14:18:55] <Crendel> Well i want that but for each deffering state
[14:19:29] <Crendel> Would i have to seperate my main array into states ? and create seperate bloodhound objects and seperate typeahead objects ?
[14:24:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:25:18] <robertmaxrees> describe the end result you're looking for.
[14:26:55] <Crendel> Jsut like what they have but insteaad my data set is [{name, state}] and instead of how there is grouped by NBA and NHL. mines is grouped by the states found in my main array
[14:28:28] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're talking about twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/#multiple-datasets
[14:28:35] <Crendel> yea
[14:28:47] <robertmaxrees> you have different states as headings and want all of them to share a particular template?
[14:29:59] <Crendel> well i finished coding an example
[14:30:02] <Crendel> http://plnkr.co/edit/95j6Ydu8ZM3Ht3dxa5T0?p=preview
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> you could always put together a simplified example and get that going.
[14:30:07] <Crendel> basically is that the best way to do it
[14:30:12] <Crendel> ;)
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[14:45:00] <sportman> heyall, im finding myself in a bind, my hosting doesn't support anysort of node js or websockets
[14:45:24] <sportman> but i want to determine when a server flag for alerts is set, and then display the alert to the frontend user without them refreshing
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[14:45:40] <sportman> should i just be doing a timer? and check for the flag every 15 seconds, if the flag is found do a full refresh?
[14:45:44] <robertmaxrees> what does your host support?
[14:45:49] <robertmaxrees> and how are you setting the flag?
[14:46:00] <sportman> im using wpengine and wordpress
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> so you can access this data via your browser already?
[14:46:19] <sportman> was considering just having the flag be set in the db, and have a wpajax endpoint
[14:46:27] <robertmaxrees> because at that point all you can really to ajax.
[14:46:31] <sportman> or i was considering having a static json file
[14:46:36] <robertmaxrees> *you can really only do ajax.
[14:47:08] <sportman> yea it just bums me that i cant use sockets io, or webscokets
[14:47:22] <sportman> i dont want to overload the server with this stupid ajax call happening every 15 seconds from every open browser
[14:47:44] <robertmaxrees> sockets wouldn't solve that particular problem fwiw.
[14:47:59] <sportman> ah i wasnt sure how sockets and node worked i guess?
[14:48:13] <robertmaxrees> just a different kind of overhead.
[14:48:14] <sportman> form what it looked like was that it could actualyl push something to the users
[14:48:21] <robertmaxrees> it can, sort of.
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> but the perf implications are roughly the same.
[14:48:43] <sportman> so if i had sockets, when the db value was set i coudl also be setting up sockets to push
[14:48:45] <sportman> ah
[14:48:46] <sportman> ok
[14:48:51] <sportman> i guess that makes me less worried
[14:49:13] <sportman> i'm also considering just finding a push service api provider that also does an embedable js
[14:49:25] <sportman> but that would be down the road
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> why not find a less shitty host?
[14:49:40] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:49:53] <sportman> i have tried over 20 in the past 5 years
[14:50:06] <sportman> this is the only one that i actual feel confident shit wont break on
[14:50:11] <robertmaxrees> like, heroku would give you exactly what you need.
[14:50:21] <robertmaxrees> AWS is easy enough to setup for fault tolerance, too.
[14:50:30] <sportman> its not about ease of set up
[14:50:43] <robertmaxrees> if it was about ease, i wouldn't suggest aws ;)
[14:50:48] <robertmaxrees> and heroku is pretty tolerant.
[14:50:48] <sportman> :p
[14:51:04] <sportman> wpengine just works, so so so well
[14:51:14] <sportman> they def limit things
[14:52:09] <sportman> i just, havent had to think about server issues for a year
[14:52:16] <sportman> and its nice to finally have peace of mind
[14:52:22] <sportman> if the server needs more ram they actually give it more ram
[14:52:39] <sportman> i have padig $500 a month for managed servers and they still call me at 4 am and are like oh your server is having problems
[14:52:47] <sportman> im like why didnt you give it more ram
[14:52:56] <sportman> oh we cant do that you have to do it through the web portal
[14:53:05] <sportman> what is the point of paying for managed...
[14:53:12] <sportman> nightmares
[14:53:19] <robertmaxrees> that's why i like AWS/Heroku ;)
[14:54:11] <sportman> you havent had to think about things at all since using it?
[14:54:42] <robertmaxrees> i have a quiet little service running on heroku that sustains decent amounts of traffic that i've had 0 issues with.
[14:55:09] <robertmaxrees> aws is a little more complicated, but once you get the setup down, you're golden.
[14:55:45] <sportman> eh
[14:55:59] <sportman> id much rather work around little limitations and not have to worry
[14:56:05] <sportman> whats considered a good amount of traffic?
[14:56:41] <robertmaxrees> this particular one handles around 100 requests per minute right now.  we exposed it to 6x that without any issues.
[15:00:49] <claytonzaugg> Is there a tutorial or walkthrough to get a loader like this http://codepen.io/naoyashiga/pen/HnCub but just the outter most ring applied to a CSS created circle?
[15:01:04] <CAPITANOOO> is better soft e micro o micro e soft
[15:03:01] <robertmaxrees> CAPITANOOO huh?
[15:03:43] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, would you have any advice for my question?
[15:04:52] <claytonzaugg> Nevermind robertmaxrees, I figured it out, I changed the 10 in the for loop to 1
[15:04:54] <claytonzaugg> Thank you!
[15:05:14] <robertmaxrees> then don't use a for loop?
[15:07:24] <claytonzaugg> lol even better *shakes his head with a grin* such ease, much simple
[15:08:13] <thinkeyP> Is there any function called when changing page in jquery mobile?
[15:17:02] <crisumi> So let's say I wanted to have a drag and drop div-- where you can drag specific elements into it, and it'll place those elements in the div. Now this will require some auto-adjusting as the user won't SPECIFICALLY place the item exactly where they want it, but rather just a pre-defined section on the div or something
[15:17:16] <crisumi> does this make sense? and is it possible with jquery or maybe a library available?
[15:17:20] <robertmaxrees> you want it to snap into place?
[15:18:11] <crisumi> yeah sure. and let's say i'm building a brochure--- maybe  there's 2 spots for product images and 2 spots for coupons-- of which there will be elements available for dragging, but prod images won't be allowed to snap into a coupon spot, etc
[15:18:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui has all those tools.
[15:18:28] <crisumi> that is a much better description: snapping into place heh
[15:18:53] <crisumi> i saw this:
[15:18:53] <crisumi> https://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/draggable/snap-to.html
[15:19:23] <crisumi> is that essentially what you reference?
[15:19:32] <robertmaxrees> part of it, yeah.
[15:19:35] <crisumi> seems like it's too nice of jquery to have so much out of bo
[15:19:36] <crisumi> box*
[15:19:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui jas that out of the box.
[15:19:48] <robertmaxrees> not jquery
[15:19:54] <crisumi> i meant ui sorry
[15:20:17] <crisumi> what other parts of the jquery ui do you think i'd need? i'm attempting to just create an exercise for myself to learn more about it
[15:20:28] <robertmaxrees> check out everything w/r/t draggable and droppable
[15:20:29] <crisumi> or is it all under draggable?
[15:20:34] <crisumi> ok perfect.
[15:20:45] <crisumi> i wasn't sure if you'd be like ohhh grab this library or somethign
[15:21:03] <crisumi> but i can mess with the ui for a bit :D ty ty
[15:21:23] <crisumi> question though
[15:21:32] <crisumi> would there be a better reason to use something like SVG?
[15:21:51] <crisumi> obviously jquery ui may be better for the description i gave, but let's say someone wanted to design some type of div by dragging, dropping, etc
[15:22:04] <crisumi> i've seen some svg examples but i don't understand WHY svg vs jquery
[15:22:05] <robertmaxrees> depends on what all you need/.
[15:22:15] <robertmaxrees> and svg and jquery serve entirely different purposes.
[15:23:01] <crisumi> hmm
[15:23:11] <robertmaxrees> you could built a solution using javascript and svg for instance.
[15:23:12] <crisumi> i saw a create your ow ncoupon type thing using svg
[15:23:20] <crisumi> hmmm
[15:23:45] <crisumi> where woudl i find info about SVG --- besides how the SVG is generated ,etc. whenever i try to google it just shows about SVG objects, not say SVG with html5 or whatever it is that makes it work
[15:23:46] <crisumi> haha
[15:23:52] <crisumi> to me, svg is an image type
[15:24:04] <robertmaxrees> that's basically all it is.
[15:24:10] <crisumi> i can't find the main docs or something regarding how to do crazy stuff with it, like using JS to add to it
[15:24:18] <crisumi> maybe i'm coming at it from the wrong angle
[15:24:21] <robertmaxrees> !g mdn svg
[15:24:22] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: SVG | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG
[15:24:30] <robertmaxrees> ^ start here.
[15:24:44] <crisumi> ok cool. i appreciate it robertmaxrees
[15:24:55] <crisumi> trying to learn something new and obscure (to me at least)
[15:25:36] <crisumi> :D
[15:26:00] <crisumi> the only thing i've ever found was svg.js
[15:26:12] <crisumi> but wasn't really what i was wanting in terms of reference
[15:26:19] <crisumi> anywho, happy hunting for me!
[15:31:43] <SmashingX> hi, I have this form: http://jsfiddle.net/nedxkpw3/ I would like to know if there’s any way that I can replace that specific value (999999.99999) with NA and how can I do it?
[15:32:23] <robertmaxrees> .val('NA')
[15:41:06] <Je5s> with plupupload where do you add remove file functionality
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> you mean like a handler for when a file is removed?
[15:42:47] <Je5s> i have an x on each file that is uploaded. i want to delete the file that x is by.
[15:43:06] <Je5s> generally speaking how does this work.

[16:33:03] <MZ|Alex> I need to catch all clicks on screen, how bad is it to do something like $("*").click( myCatchAllFunction );  ?
[16:33:14] <robertmaxrees> terrible.
[16:33:24] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to capture all of them?
[16:33:30] <robertmaxrees> that also doesn't provide any guarantees fwiw.
[16:33:54] <MZ|Alex> I'm not sure other way to do it
[16:34:01] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need to do that?
[16:35:10] <MZ|Alex> hmm I want to do something like what http://www.oculus.com does on his menu dismisal: you click anywhere, and the menu closes
[16:35:38] <MZ|Alex> to try it, you have to resize the browser so the "mobile" version appears with that 3-lines icon on it
[16:36:16] <MZ|Alex> I just want to catch any user interaction to dismiss the menu, just like that site does
[16:37:44] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener on body then.
[16:38:11] <MZ|Alex> good, there's a name I can google now, I was clueless about this
[16:38:26] <robertmaxrees> hell, you could just do something like $('body').on('click', function(e) { console.log(e.currentTarget) });
[16:38:30] <robertmaxrees> see if that gets you started.
[16:38:39] <MZ|Alex> thanks!!
[16:39:40] <MZ|Alex> is is .click() a shorthand for on('click',f)  ?
[16:40:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:40:27] <MZ|Alex> thanks! that'll get me entertained for a while :)
[17:13:06] <Mehrzad> Hi. What is the event for when the user navigates to a page including using the "back" key?
[17:13:29] <robertmaxrees> document ready / the popstate
[18:28:25] <acidjazz> documentary ready / the popstate by robertmaxrees
[18:28:44] <acidjazz> 65% on rotten tomatoes
[18:54:34] <MZ|Alex> is there any way to detect when a media query has executed?
[18:55:18] <MZ|Alex> I need to run some functions only if the layout changes because of a media query has run.
[19:03:13] <alturic> If I knew I was going to eventually (as in they generate in real-time on the server) always have say... 50 files in a given directory, and each file is a <button> on a page... is there any way to have angular or jquery "know" if the 50 files exist? So if files 1-10 exist, the <button> has a different class to it versus a non-existent file? I'm trying to wrap my head around if this is something
[19:03:13] <alturic> strictly server-side or if it could be done client-side... I'm thinking even if it was client-side capable, it would have to try hitting all 50 files in order to know if they existed... blah.
[19:04:35] <acidjazz> MZ|Alex: you're gonna have to obey sizign like css does
[19:04:42] <acidjazz> MZ|Alex: css doesnt have any callbacks or anything
[19:06:10] <MZ|Alex> Im just going to check if attribute changes then (the one that mediaquery affects)
[19:09:50] <MZ|Alex> jquery is really easy to catch, I'm loving it!
[19:16:14] <acidjazz> ah css attributes
[19:16:24] <acidjazz> well you're gonna eithe rhave to have an interval check
[19:16:28] <acidjazz> or check upon a .resize
[19:20:43] <MZ|Alex> on resize seems to be ideal for this :)
[20:17:35] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/sf33z88e/1/ hi, right now the script is getting the name attribute of the fields... can i change that into id or class????

[22:08:37] <Uhkis> sounds like you're doing it wrong
[22:08:40] <Uhkis> make a fiddle

[23:24:31] <Autochre> What are hemroids
[23:25:01] <Autochre> someone told me hemroids were things that grew inside your ass.  They told me that hemroids could fall out your anus.  Is this true?
[23:25:07] <Cork> a similar place where you've come from?
[23:25:25] <Autochre> what I've come from #quassel
[23:25:26] <Cork> go spam somewhere else
[23:25:49] <Autochre> I was referred to ##politics from #quassel but couldn't talk there so I picked a random channel I could talk in
[23:25:57] <daemon> Cork, don't feed the trolls
[23:25:58] <Autochre> What are hemroids?  is it humroids?
[23:26:14] <Autochre> no seriously, what are hemroids
[23:26:48] <slax0r> lol
[23:27:14] <Autochre> no seriously I think I have some hemroids
[23:27:21] <Autochre> and i don't want them to fall out of my anus
[23:27:30] <Autochre> I've had diarrhea and had to shit outsidde
[23:27:35] <Autochre> in the grass
[23:27:54] <Autochre> wait I looked it up in google
[23:28:05] <Autochre> it says "hemorrhoids" when I enter "what are hemroids"
[23:28:24] <Autochre> hemroids are known as piles
[23:28:32] <slax0r> Cork: can't you ban?
[23:28:35] <Cork> no
[23:28:42] <slax0r> ignore it is then
[23:28:58] <Autochre> Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anal canal.
[23:29:02] <Autochre> There, I got my answer
[23:29:18] <Autochre> so if I have diarrhea, does it mean I have hemorrhoids
[23:29:41] <Autochre> my poo that I left on the grass had orange spots in it, it was light brown with a hint of green
[23:29:50] <Autochre> could they be hemorrhoids?

[23:32:08] <daemon> ah
[23:32:11] <daemon> that will do
[23:32:14] <Cork> ya
[23:32:24] <Cork> i usually ping the staffers
[23:32:30] <daemon> so did I
[23:32:39] <daemon> I wonder how many pm's those guys get
[23:32:41] <Cork> it helps better then hunting for ops in this channel...
[23:32:44] <daemon> oh
[23:32:49] <daemon> I pinged the access list with +o or higher
[23:32:55] <Cork> ya, that is ops
[23:33:01] <Cork> ops can't k-line :)
[23:33:06] <Cork> staffers can
[23:33:08] <daemon> yep
[23:33:29] <daemon> I wonder why people spam IRC now days
[23:33:36] <nchambers> boredom
[23:33:37] <daemon> most of the world is on facebook or other
[23:33:56] <Cork> not really
[23:34:01] <daemon> it was ridiculous when IRC popular, now it just seems retarded.
[23:34:06] <Cork> open source is still mainly irc or mailing lists
[23:34:18] <daemon> thats true
[23:34:18] <nchambers> ^
[23:34:21] <nchambers> + forums
[23:34:42] <Cork> forums do happen, but it isn't even close to as popular
[23:35:09] <nchambers> yeah it just seemed weird not to include them, since they do play a role, albeit a minor one
[23:38:56] <RustyJ> IRC spammers and antagonists(flooders, nickserv auths, etc.) are beyond lame. There is very little if any competition for users. In the golden age they would do it to chase people to other networks. Spam and flood, spam and flood.
[23:40:24] <Uhkis> at least that spammer wasn't one of those totally random lines for hours
[23:40:43] <idiot> hello
[23:42:39] <idiot> I am almost 30 years old. I have never worked and have been applying(fast food, retail, entry level) just to be told I am not what they are looking for (We have reviewed your application for this position and will be proceeding with other candidates at this time.) or they are not hiring. No interviews. Cannot volunteer as there is no where near too. Cannot afford college and cannot move. Been trying for 10 years
[23:44:52] <Uhkis> not sure if worthy of the nickname or troll
[23:45:06] <Cork> troll
[23:45:10] <Cork> no question about it
[23:45:26] <idiot> Not a troll
[23:45:31] <idiot> Not a trollOr worthy of nick
[23:46:03] <idiot> I have some screenshots of recipes that I would like to put on 4x6 cards but still be able to read the words. Is there a way to do this are am I going to have to print them out on full sheets of paper?
[23:46:56] <daemon> Cork, my room is only 60% of the size of this one and hardly gets trolls at all -_- must be because jquery is a common name
[23:47:30] <Cork> daemon: the number of users in the channel doesn't really reflect how "big" the channel is
[23:47:42] <Cork> it is more about how well known the project the channel belongs to is
[23:48:02] <Uhkis> more users attract more trolling/spamming too i'd say
[23:48:21] <Cork> not to my experience no
[23:48:36] <Cork> except for those bots that goes into random channels listed on /list
[23:49:10] <Cork> it is always funny to see those bots going into the irc ops channel and starts spamming there
[23:49:17] <Cork> k-lined in about 2 sec flat XD
[23:49:35] <Uhkis> weird that there's no antispam bots on freenode
[23:50:06] <daemon> Uhkis, I proposed the idea to lilo time ago, the idea went to devel; but ... fate interuppted and crystal did not want to continue the project.
[23:50:08] <Cork> freenode is very VERY conservative about power utilization
[23:50:26] <Cork> heck they even instruct ops to not have +o on by default
[23:50:42] <Uhkis> why is that btw
[23:50:49] <Cork> power abuse
[23:51:19] <Cork> a longer reasoning is on there faq page
[23:55:36] <Cork> Uhkis: https://freenode.net/channel_guidelines.shtml
[23:55:55] <Cork> so not in the faq but in the guidelines
[23:56:20] <Uhkis> "shtml" :)
[23:56:54] <idiot> I have some screenshots of recipes that I would like to put on 4x6 cards but still be able to read the words. Is there a way to do this are am I going to have to print them out on full sheets of paper?
[23:57:56] <toomus> Hi all
[23:58:55] <toomus> How to select textarea.my-class or input.my-class?
[23:59:10] <Uhkis> toomus: just like that
[23:59:29] <toomus> But in one $('...')
[23:59:29] <Cork> toomus: separate them by a comma
[23:59:39] <toomus> Ah OK
[23:59:47] <Cork> IN the string
[23:59:50] <Cork> not as two strings
