[02:18:04] <Cork> konrados: you can't ever add events to html
[02:18:22] <Cork> konrados: you could try adding a delegated event handler to a parent and hoping the event bubbles
[04:23:50] <iamarun> help ! i want jquery ui autocomplete to not substitute the value selected but want to some task and close menu
[04:27:10] <iamarun> anyone can help
[04:27:19] <Cork> what is the question
[04:27:28] <Cork> you've only made a statement this far
[04:28:03] <iamarun> well have this textbos that does search using ajax and get items and shows as autocomplete
[04:28:22] <iamarun> when the user presses the items they want it substitutes a value on the text box
[04:28:39] <iamarun> i don't want it to substitute the value in the text box
[04:28:50] <Cork> uh "they"
[04:30:17] <iamarun> * when the user presses the item it substitutes the value
[04:30:24] <iamarun> sorry in a hurry
[04:30:33] <Cork> so add a select event handler
[04:30:39] <iamarun> i have
[04:30:57] <iamarun> wait
[04:31:36] <iamarun> https://pastebin.com/n8L2WnTS
[04:32:12] <iamarun> sorry
[04:32:32] <iamarun> https://pastebin.com/tUxTqAzk
[04:32:32] <Cork> uh...
[04:32:35] <iamarun> this one
[04:32:36] <iamarun> sorry
[04:33:07] <iamarun> i tried ('#complete).val(" ");
[04:33:18] <iamarun> #complete is the text box
[04:33:18] <Cork> O_o'
[04:33:42] <Cork> why aren't you just using autocomplete source instead of building a local autocomplete on ajax done?
[04:34:33] <iamarun> the guy who is head of me wants it done that way
[04:36:09] <iamarun> he says "the substitution done is an hinderance to the user"
[04:36:15] <iamarun> so clear the text box
[04:36:55] <Cork> and what needs to invert the autocomplete cause?
[04:37:46] <Cork> ugg... and your using global variables for everything...
[04:42:45] <iamarun> i am using let and var where ever possible
[04:43:02] <iamarun> i am still learning
[04:43:32] <iamarun> tell me how to stop substitution ;C
[04:43:43] <Cork> i already have
[04:44:19] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[04:44:39] <iamarun> i tried ('#complete).val(" ");
[04:44:43] <iamarun> its not working
[04:44:52] <iamarun> in select
[04:45:16] <iamarun> i removed even
[04:45:20] <iamarun> event*
[04:45:32] <iamarun> and it blacksout when selecting
[04:47:09] <iamarun> will event preventdefault work ?
[04:47:15] <iamarun> in side ?
[04:47:24] <Cork> read the link i gave you
[05:05:40] <iamarun> Cork, its working now
[05:05:55] <iamarun> Cork, thanks
[06:21:13] <IamTrying> var from = document.getElementById('localVideo'); var to = document.getElementById('miniVideo'); when i do to.src = from.src it does not copy the live stream?
[06:21:29] <Woet> IamTrying: what is your jQuery question?
[06:22:00] <IamTrying> $('#to').attr('src' , $('#from').attr('src') ); - Woet
[06:22:14] <IamTrying> not working where #from has live stream
[06:22:25] <IamTrying> i need to do seamless live stream swap
[06:22:30] <Woet> IamTrying: show a working demo on www.jsfiddle.net
[06:35:46] <IamTrying> OK - i will have to prepare one live stream
[06:35:57] <stevooo> Is it faster for a browser to render CSS than JS?
[06:38:50] <Cork> stevooo: yes
[06:39:00] <Cork> stevooo: js is reactive while css is declarative
[06:39:33] <Cork> so the browser knows how things will behave before hand with css while js will have to be triggered when things changes and then the browser will have to look for what changed
[06:40:13] <Cork> this makes things slow, so now days browser are more and more delaying telling js, so you get tears instead
[06:42:12] <stevooo> I see
[06:42:53] <Cork> window width/height and scrolling are two good examples of this
[06:43:00] <stevooo> When CSS introduced CSS 3.0, transitions and other animations could be done directly in CSS, its better use them instead of creating these functions in JS?
[06:43:21] <Cork> yes
[06:43:28] <Cork> cause like i said they are declarative
[06:43:51] <Cork> so when the browser knows it will have to draw a frame in say 2ms is can precalculate the new position beforehand
[06:44:00] <stevooo> easier to maintain CSS
[06:44:19] <Cork> while js animations normally either happen on an interval or by requestAnimationFrame
[06:44:35] <Cork> and when that change the browser doesn't know what changed so it will have to then "hunt" for the changes
[06:44:50] <Cork> so a lot of optimizations isn't possible
[06:45:44] <Cork> there are some new apis added where you can define the same thing css can from js in a more capable way that is still more or less declarative
[06:45:58] <Cork> so it isn't as clear cut as it was a little while ago
[06:46:13] <stevooo> Thanks, alot of information :)
[06:46:14] <Cork> but ya, css animations is a lot simpler to maintain then js animations
[06:46:28] <Cork> tiny side note its css3 not 3.0 :)
[06:46:51] <Cork> and they moved to css modules after 3 so there won't be a css4
[06:47:27] <stevooo> no CSS4 coming?
[06:47:35] <Cork> nope
[06:47:40] <Cork> like i said it is modules now
[06:47:57] <Cork> so you get things like css grid <version> and things like that
[06:48:35] <stevooo> sry, been away from frontend since 2009.
[06:48:44] <Cork> e.x https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/
[06:50:03] <Cork> (shouldn't link tr as it is normally not up to date but i don't have the correct draft link at hand right now)
[06:50:37] <Cork> ah there we go https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/
[06:51:17] <Cork> stevooo: also no need to say sorry, it wasn't a problem what you said i just wanted you to know how things are moving :)
[06:51:54] <Woet> Cork: sorry
[06:52:07] <Woet> IamTrying: i sincerely doubt it depends on the src, by the way.
[06:52:09] * Cork hits Woet with a big trout
[06:56:35] <IamTrying> https://jsfiddle.net/mc1b9s7p/ - Woet, click Copy stream of above
[06:56:48] <Woet> IamTrying: why is all that code relevant?
[06:57:13] <Woet> IamTrying: "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: swap"
[06:57:18] <Woet> IamTrying: please, a /working/ /minimal/ demo
[07:13:32] <IamTrying> Never mind. its working to.srcObject = localVideo.srcObject;  but not working to.src = localVideo.src (in past it was working now not anymore)
[07:13:35] <IamTrying> Thank you
[07:53:20] <konrados> Cork, I don't understand, what do you mean by "you can't ever add events to html"?
[07:55:44] <Cork> konrados: what i mean to add event handlers you need the dom
[07:55:53] <Cork> html is just text
[07:59:38] <konrados> Cork, yes, I know... I added an event to $('.myClass'), I think you misread :) But anyway, thanks, I "solved" my problem, in a tricky way but still :P
[08:00:06] <Cork> konrados: the best solution is like i said to just bind it to a static parent
[08:01:37] <konrados> Cork, ahh, ok, let me try that. So you think there is a chance the 'playing' even bubbles up, for example, to a div container?
[08:01:56] <Cork> konrados: depends on how they fire the event, but ya it normally does
[08:02:13] <konrados> Cork, ok, let me try that!
[08:02:17] <Cork> just do $('static-parent-selector').on('playing', 'video', func) or similar
[08:02:55] <Cork> but ya it depends on how it generates the event
[08:30:36] <konrados> Cork, thanks again. It seems though that 'audio/video' events don't bubble. Here is what I googled: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12630384/4568686 - (although addEventListener with 'true' as third arg works) but, thanks to all of this I found a better way to do what I need, so thanks again!
[08:31:12] <Cork> ya... should have checked https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/playing
[08:36:38] <konrados> ah, wow, they change the layout completely recently, or... maybe not, I haven't been there for a long time :P
[08:36:43] <konrados> *changed
[08:43:57] <Cork> they do that about once a year it feels like
[10:13:22] <rjCousineau> Hello, I'm using a delay function for custom callback, except the function doesn't support multiple callbacks.. I can't seem to figure this out.. https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/
[10:14:15] <Cork> rjCousineau: ya you have one timer variable and if it is set you kill the timer
[10:14:24] <Cork> you would have to make it per element or something like that
[10:14:45] <Cork> rjCousineau: or you could just use the built in delay features in jquery
[10:16:55] <rjCousineau> cork: ? built in? it is for user input delay in ajax validation
[10:18:32] <rjCousineau> nm I can assign the function a var for each instance
[10:19:44] <Cork> rjCousineau: https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/3/
[10:20:03] <Cork> don't name it delay :P
[10:21:34] <rjCousineau> sweet!
[10:21:39] <rjCousineau> amazing
[10:21:41] <rjCousineau> ty!
[10:21:52] <Cork> and if you call the unqueue directly from the caller you don't need soon
[10:22:20] <Cork> just $('body').delay(500).queue(function() { /* your code */ $(this).dequeue(); });
[10:22:54] <Cork> rjCousineau: ya it is quite nice when you need something to be element dependent
[10:28:43] <rjCousineau> Hi Cork, unfortunately, it seems to fire on each keyup: https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/5/
[10:33:12] <Cork> rjCousineau: those two criterias kinda conflict :)
[10:33:34] <Cork> either you want to queue the functions or you want to abort the earlier one if a new is requested
[10:34:11] <Cork> rjCousineau: or do you want the queue to be per element?
[10:34:28] <rjCousineau> I'm looking the queu to be per element
[10:34:44] <rjCousineau> yea
[10:34:46] <Cork> then you can't bind it on document or body
[10:35:00] <rjCousineau> oh?
[10:36:33] <Cork> ex. https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/6/
[10:37:28] <Cork> opps for got one thing
[10:38:14] <Cork> hmm why is it only firing once...
[10:38:20] <rjCousineau> interesting
[10:38:29] <Cork> fixed https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/7/
[10:38:40] <Cork> but i'm still not happy with the firing one min
[10:41:27] <Cork> ah, damn you can't abort a .delay
[10:41:30] <Cork> didn't know that
[10:41:44] <Cork> oh well
[10:42:08] <rjCousineau> setTimeout clearTimeout instead of delay]
[10:42:37] <Cork> rjCousineau: https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/8/
[10:42:40] <Cork> slight modification :)
[10:43:14] <Cork> oh boy typo
[10:43:19] <rjCousineau> i like :)
[10:43:23] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/9/
[10:43:30] <Cork> 2500 != 250 XD
[10:43:38] <rjCousineau> no biggie :)
[10:43:48] <rjCousineau> amazing! it works well
[10:43:59] <Cork> anyway ya, the solution is to store the timer per target element
[10:44:11] <Cork> then you don't have the problem you had with your original code
[10:44:58] <Cork> rjCousineau: btw that code only works when soon is called on one element
[10:45:13] <Cork> though by structure it doesn't make sense to do anything else to be honest
[10:45:14] <rjCousineau> checking
[10:45:43] <Cork> the reason is this.data() this can be multiple elements if you ex do $('*').soon
[10:45:51] <Cork> it won't call the callback once for each element
[10:45:57] <Cork> it will do it just once
[10:46:10] <rjCousineau> So, interesting..
[10:46:21] <Cork> can be trivialy fixed though
[10:48:25] <Cork> rjCousineau: https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/11/
[10:48:35] <Cork> added support for this in the callback too :)
[10:50:32] <rjCousineau> https://jsfiddle.net/cxjvsakn/12/
[10:52:30] <rjCousineau> for some reason, when I tab into the next field, the delay fires instantly for that element. I can't reproduce it in fiddle yet
[10:52:49] <rjCousineau> (both elements fire). your example works perfectly though
[10:52:53] <Cork> rjCousineau: ya, tab is keyup so...
[10:53:02] <Cork> rjCousineau: might be better to use change?
[10:53:12] <rjCousineau> for text?
[10:53:17] <Cork> doesn't matter
[10:53:20] <rjCousineau> hmm
[10:53:27] <Cork> keyup doens't filter out option keys
[10:53:50] <Cork> you could use input, but then it would fire on each keypress
[10:53:53] <rjCousineau> change worked :)
[10:53:57] <rjCousineau> woot!
[11:48:48] <wgwz__> are there valid security reasons for not tracking js libraries in git? (i.e. jquery, qunit, momentjs)
[11:49:09] <Woet> huh?
[11:49:32] <Woet> why would there be?
[11:50:16] <Woet> you'd want to stick to a specific version anyways
[11:50:19] <Woet> so i'm not sure why you would
[11:51:28] <taplar> Some projects don't include jquery and the like in their repos because they will pull them during build, so they don't bloat their repo size.
[11:51:32] <wgwz__> that's what i am asking :)
[11:52:00] <Woet> well, theres no valid security reason
[11:52:03] <Woet> theres plenty of valid other reasons
[11:53:12] <wgwz__> ok, so it's not security related
[11:53:52] <wgwz__> the build reasons make sense
[12:09:27] <mrmontoto> hello guys
[12:09:41] <mrmontoto> sorry how do i include a notification inside a controller.js ?
[12:09:41] <taplar> ko'nichiwa
[12:09:55] <mrmontoto> this is suppose to display a sort of notifycation message on there
[12:10:04] <taplar> no idea what you're asking about
[12:37:09] <t532> see comment https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/ojb8pwrz/11/
[12:39:01] <codecutter> see comment https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/ojb8pwrz/11/

[13:08:17] <robertmaxrees> still fighting against that?

[13:22:57] <codecutter> :)
[13:30:01] <robertmaxrees> codecutter why are you still fighting that plugin?
[13:30:05] <robertmaxrees> why not find one that works instead?
[13:30:36] <codecutter> it works, i just how to figure out how :)
[13:30:45] <codecutter> have*
[13:31:04] <codecutter> i actually just got back from last night
[13:31:33] <codecutter> its not a  big priority...
[15:54:26] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[15:54:33] <GeekMonkey> I am using the slick slider
[15:54:44] <GeekMonkey> https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/
[15:55:10] <GeekMonkey> I created a codepen with a working version of a slider.... but for some reason when I put it on my site it breaks
[15:55:53] <GeekMonkey> Any thoughts why
[15:56:07] <GeekMonkey> or how I could debug it
[15:59:43] <grapheti> GeekMonkey: Got a link to your codepen?
[15:59:51] <GeekMonkey> https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/efdd41a7c527a0266ca98fe01f5642ee?editors=1010
[15:59:57] <GeekMonkey> This is my working codepen
[16:00:17] <grapheti> I just need to see errors.
[16:00:54] <GeekMonkey> grapheti ... when I add it to my live site using the same jquery/js/css it makes the slider continue to grow in size
[16:01:13] <grapheti> Must be something on your site conflicting with the plugin.
[16:02:40] <GeekMonkey> Any thoughts on how to debug?
[16:03:58] <grapheti> I can only hunt in the dark. Thinking.
[16:04:56] <grapheti> My first thought is to see what the namespace is returning.
[16:05:51] <grapheti> window.slick() or w/e, not sure what that object is on slick
[16:05:53] <GeekMonkey> what do you mean?
[16:06:25] <grapheti> and it's not overridden
[16:06:35] <grapheti> not sure that's the case here or not
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey when you say "it makes the slider continue to grow in size", what do you mean?
[16:07:55] <GeekMonkey> http://templates.rsmmdesign.com/vertical-slider-test/
[16:09:34] <grapheti> this looking like a css conflict
[16:10:28] <robertmaxrees> what's with the "asNavFor" being swapped between them?
[16:10:42] <GeekMonkey> One controls the other
[16:10:48] <GeekMonkey> and vice versa
[16:13:40] <grapheti> it's starting to look better, you making changes?
[16:15:36] <GeekMonkey> ya trying different things
[16:15:50] <GeekMonkey> it is still growing in size
[16:24:50] <grapheti> I got nothing other than it's a setting or conflicting css name messing it up. Sorry guy.
[16:26:24] <grapheti> To tell if it's conflicting css names, you can remove all the css except for the plugins.
