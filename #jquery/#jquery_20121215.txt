[00:00:13] <monk3y> I guess that either means my central nervous system has mutated to resist it. .. or it's dead.
[00:01:31] <monk3y> Enough of my sanity-starved ramblings.  On with the jQueryosity; anyone in here developed any apps that have used Recurly's Payment Subscription forms?
[00:01:56] <aqeel> sorry not me
[00:02:05] <monk3y> Well.  You know where the door is.
[00:02:13] <monk3y> $('#door').useIt();
[00:02:16] <aqeel> haha, no i do not know
[00:02:24] <monk3y> $('#door').useIt().promise();
[00:02:25] <aqeel> i only know where the ESC is
[00:02:26] <monk3y> heheh
[00:02:34] <anew> lol
[00:02:38] <anew> oh gd the jquery humor
[00:02:39] <anew> i'm dying
[00:02:50] <monk3y> You *think* it's an escape .. the government wants you to think that.
[00:03:00] <monk3y> You can hit that little key all you want pal .. you aint getting out of here.
[00:03:09] <aqeel> have you see yahoo, cybergadon
[00:03:17] <aqeel> theer is no ESC
[00:04:20] <aqeel> http://cybergeddon.yahoo.com/#home
[00:04:56] <aqeel> nice screen play
[00:05:13] <monk3y> Umm.
[00:05:23] <monk3y> What am I looking at?
[00:05:45] <monk3y> $().synopsis();
[00:05:45] <aqeel> you have to watch it to believe it
[00:06:04] <monk3y> The only thing I can assume that that image affords an escape from, is a sex-life.
[00:06:35] <monk3y> heheh, just bustin' ya balls.  It's the energy drink talkin'.  I can't feel my face.
[00:06:56] <aqeel> haha you really need to ESC
[00:07:10] <monk3y> I'm hitting the key man  .  ... but I'm still heeeeeeeeeeeeeeere
[00:07:35] <monk3y> I'm just repeated future versions of myself, all one keypress older .. and with a slightly sorer ring-finger.
[00:07:41] <aqeel> not keyboard esc but ESC in your life, the seat you are stick to, ESC that seat
[00:08:08] * monk3y checks his seat
[00:08:15] <monk3y> It's not a 104-key seat.
[00:08:21] <monk3y> It doesn't have an esc key.
[00:08:22] <joshuabud> Wondering if someone could help me solve a problem with slidein/slideout
[00:08:40] <monk3y> heheheh; joshuabud: better pickup lines?
[00:08:48] <aqeel> shoot your unescapeable question, joshuabud
[00:09:39] * monk3y tries to escape himself with a backslash
[00:09:40] <monk3y> ow
[00:09:43] <monk3y> That just hurts.
[00:09:57] <joshuabud> http://jail.rsoper.dev2.drupalconnect.com/content/accommodations
[00:10:07] <joshuabud> bottom right corner
[00:10:23] <joshuabud> why does the background go transparent?
[00:10:49] <joshuabud> it is because of the other region in the area that has a transparent background property?
[00:11:21] <monk3y> joshuabud: do you mean the whole bottom 1cm? I can't see anything different just in the bottom right corner.
[00:11:55] <aqeel> yeah, seems functional
[00:12:04] <aqeel> no transparency
[00:13:03] <monk3y> What browser(s) are you testing it in, and seeing the issue, joshuabud?
[00:13:25] <monk3y> And if you wouldn't mind screen-capping the issue you see, circling it and pastebinning it etc.
[00:14:16] <aqeel> because as of now, thee is only white background at the very bottom, and no ther stuff, weirdo...
[00:15:11] <aqeel> monk3y: i would like to add few functionality to the plugin, can you help me with that
[00:15:21] <monk3y> 'the' plugin?
[00:15:30] <monk3y> As in .. 'the' plugin?
[00:15:53] <monk3y> Wait.  Which plugin?
[00:16:01] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/dmsxv/
[00:16:06] <joshuabud> aqeel: Here is a screencast of what I'm seeing whilst using chrome http://screencast.com/t/nhVuJf8Vh4y
[00:19:33] <aqeel> still the same...what exactly the issue am i looking for
[00:19:42] <monk3y> Ah.
[00:19:49] <aqeel> get social....that part?
[00:19:58] <joshuabud> Yes sorry
[00:19:59] <monk3y> In the screencast .. when you click "getSocial + contactUs"
[00:20:15] <joshuabud> Yeah
[00:20:18] <monk3y> It slides up .. and the div under/to the left of it should flood-in .. but it 'sticks' to the left.
[00:20:30] <monk3y> And once it's slid all the way up - THEN it renders properly.
[00:20:31] <joshuabud> then pops into place
[00:20:35] <joshuabud> exactly
[00:20:44] <joshuabud> would that be query or a CSS issue?
[00:20:55] <monk3y> Could be either, really.
[00:21:31] <monk3y> But at a very quick glance, while I'm trying to fix my own site, and procrastinate on here, it looks like you might want to play with some position: absolute kinda things, so they render over the top of each other comfortably.
[00:21:46] <monk3y> It looks like they're a little too polite right now (can't encroach on each other).
[00:21:52] <joshuabud> cool thanks monk3y
[00:22:23] <aqeel> hey you slide up start with that position and fills in to right and then slide out and hides...
[00:23:00] <aqeel> may be your starting is where you need to look for, the container before animation
[00:23:03] <monk3y> The give-away is that the content text slides to the left, so the whole div is being squashed left until it can spill out right.
[00:24:10] <aqeel> it should slide up and slide down, not slide up, slide right, slide left, slide down
[00:25:05] <aqeel> i guess the width before slide up is somehow less when the slide up completes and takes the entire container width
[00:26:54] <monk3y> You need to pull out those two divs and throw them into jsFiddle, with the applicable CSS, and see if you can make them slide over each other.
[00:27:15] <monk3y> Google "div overlap" or something.
[00:27:28] <monk3y> Or z-order.
[00:27:44] * monk3y clutches at potentially relevant buzzwords
[00:29:49] <aqeel> by the way joshuabud you can use one css file and include all your @ in yhat one file and have it linked
[00:32:13] <joshuabud> I appreciate the feedback and I'll dig a bit deeper here :) thanks again
[00:35:23] <aqeel> anyone who would love to work with me on the plugin
[00:43:50] <relipse> anyone want to beta-test hourly contracting time tracker website cworklog.com ?
[00:52:00] <popof_> relipse: no thanks, good luck on the project though

[04:27:55] <sunbeam> hi, i'm adding google maps to a page using the api. However, when this part (the div google maps is displayed in) is hidden at page load, when I later show it, it's not working properly (only small part of map displays)
[04:28:00] <sunbeam> any ideas how come?
[04:37:04] <BinaryKitten> sunbeam hi, which bit is using jQuery?
[04:48:25] <sunbeam> which bit?
[04:48:35] <sunbeam> $("."+hidden_content).hide();
[04:48:37] <sunbeam> $("."+visible_content).fadeIn("fast");
[04:48:46] <BinaryKitten> ok
[04:49:22] <BinaryKitten> are you doing this before or after the map has rendered
[04:49:32] <BinaryKitten> also, does the map work fine when you don't hide/show it
[04:50:09] <sunbeam> It works when I show it without hiding yes
[04:50:16] <sunbeam> It works when I show the map div for the first time
[04:50:27] <sunbeam> When I hide it again then, and then show it again its messed
[04:50:41] <sunbeam> probably because i init it a second time
[04:50:42] <sunbeam> var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map-canvas"), mapOptions);
[04:51:05] <BinaryKitten> yep that might do it
[04:51:14] <BinaryKitten> 2nd init doesn't overwrite the 1st
[04:51:17] <BinaryKitten> it appends to it
[04:51:41] <BinaryKitten> also sunbeam, don't hide #map-canvas
[04:51:50] <BinaryKitten> wrap that element and hide the wrapper
[04:52:05] <BinaryKitten> google maps does weird things with the target element
[05:00:22] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: so what should i do?
[05:00:23] <sunbeam> i dont get it
[05:01:16] <BinaryKitten> ok
[05:01:37] <BinaryKitten> <div class="hidden"><div id="map-canvas"></div></div>
[05:01:47] <BinaryKitten> hide the parent, not the target
[05:02:00] <BinaryKitten> also, don't call the map init again
[05:02:16] <sunbeam> BinaryKitten: that's what I already do
[05:02:19] <sunbeam> class hidden
[05:03:46] <BinaryKitten> right
[05:03:54] <BinaryKitten> but you've got it on the map-canvas?
[05:04:10] <sunbeam> no, thats visible
[05:04:19] <sunbeam> i mean yes thats where google maps is on
[05:05:51] <BinaryKitten> gah
[05:06:05] <BinaryKitten> ok let me ask the question again
[05:06:16] <BinaryKitten> do you hide map-canvas directly
[05:07:01] <BinaryKitten> does the tag with the id "map-canvas" get the class of "hidden", does it get display:none added to
[05:07:05] <BinaryKitten> it's style
[05:09:07] <sunbeam> no
[05:12:09] <BinaryKitten> ok then
[05:12:24] <BinaryKitten> so, make sure you don't run that init twice and see what happens from tehre
[05:12:30] * BinaryKitten departs
[05:15:44] <sunbeam> also tried hehe
[05:28:49] <aqeel> sunbeam: what is wrong....what is your issue

[08:07:16] <db42> is there any tip on how to dynamically add elements to an "ui" for a list in jquery mobile ? when i do it staiatically it seems to auto add stuff

[09:14:18] <aqeel> hi room
[09:14:50] <aqeel> i am unablr to find anything online, that will take me to jquery plugin developer community
[09:15:12] <aqeel> i am having hard time to enhance the lugin
[09:15:17] <aqeel> plugin*
[09:31:29] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm trying to create a JS event for the HTML produced by the following code. I tried appending a new function at the end of the function in there (  }, function() { ... });  ) but I had no luck. I also tried using AJAX's "complete: function(xhr, status) {" method. Anybody know anything else I should try to get this to work? http://pastebin.com/JQPK1nqu
[09:50:09] <Imaginativeone> what, exactly is a callback?
[09:51:13] <h4S8> just function which execute the initial function completed
[09:57:01] <s34n_> how can I get http://jsfiddle.net/gWFch/ to look right?
[09:57:32] <s34n_> I need the text input to be the right height
[09:57:46] <s34n_> and the various elements not to overlap each other
[09:59:58] <Absolute1> Say I am implementing a drag event, is it ineffecient to unbind/rebind on each mouseup/mousdown? The alternative is to have some flag which I would check within the event fire.
[10:04:13] <Imaginativeone> h458: what's that?
[10:04:21] <Imaginativeone> is it the caller?
[10:04:37] <Imaginativeone> or the function argument?
[10:04:44] <Imaginativeone> or the function parameter?
[10:05:46] <rmurphey> Imaginativeone: most basically it is doSomething( somethingElseToDoWhenItIsDone )
[10:05:56] <rmurphey> where somethingElseToDoWhenItIsDone is a function
[10:06:10] <rmurphey> you will see this in jquery with events
[10:06:21] <rmurphey> $('#foo').on('click', function() { ... });
[10:06:27] <rmurphey> the function is the "callback" to the click event
[10:06:43] <Imaginativeone> thanks!!!
[10:06:55] <Imaginativeone> been glossing over that one for too long
[10:07:00] <rmurphey> $.ajax('/some/url').done(function(response) { ... })
[10:07:15] <rmurphey> the function there is a callback to be run when the ajax request is successful
[10:07:24] <rmurphey> it receives the response to the ajax request as its argument
[10:08:21] <Imaginativeone> my mind gets twisted with the order of operations
[10:08:51] <Imaginativeone> I expect the function to be on the "inner track" and to be called first
[10:09:07] <Imaginativeone> instead, it appears to be the next step in a chain?
[10:10:09] <Imaginativeone> I'm dying to know how to work with callbacks in jQueryMobile
[10:10:22] <Imaginativeone> regrettably, that channel is invite only
[10:12:07] <astropirate> Imaginativeone, callbacks? o_O
[10:12:16] <astropirate> for what kind of things?
[10:12:41] <Imaginativeone> responses to button taps
[10:12:58] <Imaginativeone> which are actually css-styled <li> elements
[10:14:00] <astropirate> Imaginativeone, you can set event listeners
[10:14:20] <Imaginativeone> aaahhh...
[10:14:28] <Imaginativeone> please show me how to do that
[10:15:13] <voot545> I'm trying to use jQuery directly on text nodes (.nodeValue), but it seems that jQuery has no effect on the nodes
[10:15:53] <Imaginativeone> xml node?
[10:15:56] <voot545> I was using .contents().filter() before, but I needed to switch to a native/non-jQuery function
[10:16:02] <voot545> DOM text nodes
[10:16:44] <Imaginativeone> I was having difficulty with that the other day...
[10:16:46] <voot545> now that I've switched, I seem to get read access to the n.nodeValue and can see the text of the text node, but I can't remove the text nodes, or insert new text nodes
[10:17:03] <Imaginativeone> I was forced to use text as a function of its (html) container
[10:17:36] <voot545> not sure what you mean by that
[10:24:20] <Imaginativeone> can you save the results of your selections in a variable?
[10:24:40] <voot545> er
[10:25:00] <voot545> I suppose, why not
[10:32:30] <aqeel> woo hoo...
[10:32:38] <aqeel> i am so excited...

[11:01:31] <aqeel> ok room can i use scrollTop() to look for the bottom of the page, scrollable pge that is
[11:03:30] <aqeel> because scrollTop(0), does indeed takes you to top of page, thus scrollTop(given height of container - scrolled content + 10px (for safe sie)), will be end of page
[11:16:23] <kevindank> Hello, im looking for a quick easy ready to use script that will dim the background to focus on a certain specified div after a set time
[11:16:33] <kevindank> like i want the focus to be on an image after 10 seconds of loading the page
[11:16:58] <Cronoh> how about google
[11:28:53] <aqeel> $(this).stop(true).animate({scrollTop: 0}, 'fast');..this works, and $(this).stop(true).animate({scrollTop: c.height()}, 'fast');.this is not working
[11:29:17] <aqeel> the second one just stops the animation
[12:15:55] <patie> is there any way to select multiple files - and showing names - BUT not upload with ajax i want upload it throught classic POST form send..

[13:48:25] <hiby007> how to get value of checkbox ??
[13:48:44] <hiby007> i want to know weather the checkbox is checked or not
[13:48:46] <hiby007> http://jsfiddle.net/W2shv/
[13:52:08] <eizdealer> hey guys, does anyone here have experience with the jstree plugin?
[13:52:40] <eizdealer> i'm wondering how i can get the node id when a checkbox select event is triggered… having a hard time getting it to work
[13:54:53] <m4ggus> hiby007: var checkbox = $('#chkbx').is(':checked');
[13:55:42] <hiby007> ok ... thank very you m4ggus :D
[14:04:24] <hip2p> say I make 3 buttons with IDs 'button1', 'button2' and 'button3'. Is it possible to make a jquery call that could apply to all 3 buttons? For example, something like $('#button').click(function(){};) ?
[14:05:00] <hip2p> and then I could check to see which button ID was clicked
[14:07:47] <Cronoh> sure
[14:08:33] <Cronoh> $(document).on('#id1,#id2,#id3', function(event){ console.log(event.target) });
[14:08:39] <Cronoh> something alone those lines should get you there
[14:09:08] <Cronoh> and then ofcourse $(event.target).attr('id');
[14:09:09] <hip2p> ok thanks
[14:09:18] <shoky> you mean $('#id1,#id2,#id3').click(function(){})
[14:09:23] <Cronoh> yes
[14:09:25] <Cronoh> no
[14:09:38] <Cronoh> i meant
[14:10:00] <Cronoh> $(document).on('click', '#id1,#id2,#id3', function(event){ console.log(event.target) });
[14:10:17] <shoky> that works too
[14:10:29] <Cronoh> i do believe they are not the same thing
[14:10:34] <shoky> they are not
[14:10:39] <Cronoh> ok
[14:10:46] <hip2p> my issue is that I'm using jquery popover, but apparently I cannot simply run a function that has $('#template').popover('show');
[14:11:01] <hip2p> I have to actually click a button that has id='template'
[14:11:11] <hip2p> for the popover to appear
[14:11:29] <Cronoh> why
[14:11:50] <hip2p> why do I have to click the button?
[14:13:32] <hip2p> I want to run a function that populates the popover divs with the appropriate text, and then I want to show the popover. According to the popover usage manual, I cannot do this. I have to create a click event that sets up the manual trigger.
[14:23:09] <ilian> Hi, can someone propose me a good jquery plugin for image upload without flash
[14:26:41] <shoky> eizdealer: still need help?
[14:27:00] <eizdealer> shoky: i kind of found a workaround… not the best one though
[14:33:08] <shoky> eizdealer: here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/J5ZaK/85/
[14:33:13] <shoky> no workaround
[14:35:30] <eizdealer> shoky: the second you posted i got it working haha
[14:35:32] <eizdealer> thanks anyway
[14:35:35] <eizdealer> yours is way easier
[14:36:57] <ziarkaen> I have the following code: $(".LeftMenuHeading").click(function(){ $(this).css("background-color", "red"); });
[14:37:23] <ziarkaen> When I click the element, it turns red instantaeneously, then reverts.  How can I make the chnage permenant?
[14:38:00] <shoky> css changes are permanent until something comes along and changes them
[14:41:44] <ziarkaen> shoky, I have the site running here: http://www.beneills.com/new.html
[14:42:05] <ziarkaen> shoky, I have *only one* script, so what else could be modifying the CSS?
[14:42:10] <MobCat> what are you trying to do?
[14:42:27] <rosevp> quick question on datapicker
[14:42:30] <rosevp> datepicker
[14:42:42] <rosevp> how to you pass the date value from onclose
[14:43:51] <shoky> ziarkaen: when you click those <a> it's reloading the page ;P
[14:43:54] <MobCat> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[14:44:02] <ziarkaen> shoky, Actually, wait.  The link is href="", so it's refreeshing the page...
[14:44:18] <ziarkaen> shoky, Thanks.  Embarassing problem :/
[14:44:48] <rosevp> MobCat newbie question; don't think my issue is datepicker but how to save the date from onClose and pass it to another function
[14:44:49] <shoky> s'ok
[14:45:18] <rosevp> i tried val datefrom = dateSelected but no luck
[14:48:09] <mobile8> does anyone know how I can get the top: 0 position of the element I currently hover over?
[14:48:13] <mobile8> top position I mean
[14:48:56] <shoky> ?position
[14:48:57] <bot-t1> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[14:48:59] <shoky> ?css
[14:48:59] <b-ot> shoky, not asynchronous
[14:48:59] <bot-t1> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[14:50:30] <shoky> b-ot, forget css
[14:50:30] <b-ot> shoky, I have forgotten “css”. My mind is going, I can feel it.
[14:56:29] <db42> how do i tell a form field in jquery mobile to not tell the iphone to auto caps the first letter /
[14:57:52] <shoky> db42: autocapitalize="off"  maybe?
[14:58:17] <db42> will try
[14:58:38] <vrlogrs> hey guys ..
[14:58:44] <vrlogrs> need some help ..
[14:59:13] <vrlogrs> http://vrlogrs.com/quotes#s=ml&p=1 ... Line 70 of js/logs_adv.js
[14:59:25] <vrlogrs> there should be an alert everytime u hover over one of the quotes
[14:59:34] <vrlogrs> but, it's not working for some weird reason
[14:59:39] <vrlogrs> dont understand why ..
[15:00:07] <vrlogrs> if anyone has a minute to look at it -- will appreciate it
[15:00:23] <vrlogrs> dang ..
[15:00:31] <vrlogrs> it is working .. but only on the last one
[15:01:11] <vrlogrs> any clues on why it's not working for all of them?
[15:03:45] <vrlogrs> can i only have 1 hovering function at a time or something?
[15:03:48] <vrlogrs> that would be dumb ..
[15:05:06] <troop> hello
[15:05:10] <troop> $("#thumb li").click(
[15:05:10] <troop>                 function(){
[15:05:10] <troop>                    var i = $(this).id;
[15:05:10] <troop>                     alert("i");
[15:05:10] <troop>                     }
[15:05:10] <troop>             );
[15:05:15] <troop> whats wrong?
[15:05:47] <vrlogrs> troop .. $(this).attr("id") is what u want
[15:05:49] <shoky> troop: this.id
[15:05:55] <shoky> troop: and next time use a pastebin
[15:06:16] <vrlogrs> shoky: can u help me?
[15:06:20] <danheberden> .prop('id') will also work, as it's a property of the dom element
[15:06:23] <troop> thanks
[15:06:47] <danheberden> vrlogrs: you should distill that code down a bit
[15:06:56] <shoky> vrlogrs: i'm trying to figure it out. one thing that is suspicious is that youre doing a simple for loop, advancing 'a'
[15:06:57] <vrlogrs> danheberden: what do u mean?
[15:06:58] <danheberden> like, make a jsbin/jsfiddle with the problem simplified
[15:07:03] <danheberden> instead of a full site
[15:07:04] <vrlogrs> yes ..
[15:07:05] <danheberden> with a shit load of js
[15:07:14] <danheberden> that's really awful to read :/
[15:07:19] <vrlogrs> oh, sorry
[15:07:26] <danheberden> vrlogrs: it happens :)
[15:07:29] <shoky> vrlogrs: and then you are using that 'a' inside an event handler. that is wrong, because by the time the event handler is triggered, that loop is already long finished (so 'a' will have its last value)
[15:07:46] <vrlogrs> oh ..
[15:07:55] <troop> thanks for helping and i'll use pastebin next time. bye good nights:)
[15:07:55] <shoky> and yes, besides that, what danheberden said ;]
[15:08:18] <vrlogrs> but i thought a would be fixed ..
[15:08:29] <vrlogrs> i can pass it through the function right?
[15:08:33] <vrlogrs> that'll make it fixed?
[15:08:37] <shoky> vrlogrs: a simple way to fix the issue i raised is to use $.each
[15:09:02] <shoky> donno what you mean exactly, but yeah a local function context is needed
[15:09:10] <danheberden> which would look way sexier than (function(i){ /* */}(i));
[15:09:12] <shoky> $.each would provide it
[15:09:31] <vrlogrs> oh ok .. so, $.each would come under the #logs div
[15:09:49] <shoky> instead of:   for(a = 0;a < h;a++) {
[15:09:58] <shoky> uhh
[15:10:41] <shoky> whatever.
[15:10:50] <vrlogrs> ok .. ill try that .. thanks guys
[15:11:18] <shoky> hm now i noticed you're only using the 'a' in that alret
[15:11:20] <shoky> alert
[15:11:44] <vrlogrs> yes
[15:11:52] <shoky> so . dono how important the issue is that im talkin bout ;p
[15:11:53] <vrlogrs> so, a should be fixed right?
[15:12:02] <vrlogrs> yah, it shouldn't mattter
[15:12:06] <shoky> no, it'll still only show the last value
[15:12:08] <mobile8> shoky: thanks
[15:12:10] <shoky> if it worked
[15:12:31] <shoky> or maybe that's what you meant by 'fixed' heh
[15:12:47] <vrlogrs> could i do this: $(".log").each().hover(
[15:13:19] <shoky> no
[15:13:36] <vrlogrs> oh right .. sry
[15:13:37] <shoky> and if you did that , inside the loop, for every one that you add..
[15:13:49] <shoky> you'd be accumulating event handlers on the same elements
[15:14:41] <shoky> anyway yeah that code is impossible to read
[15:14:47] <vrlogrs> lol .. sorry
[15:15:08] <vrlogrs> http://pastebin.com/S0dDANKj
[15:15:24] <shoky> dont care about that part ;)
[15:15:51] <shoky> and like i said, if you put that inside the loop, it's definitely wrong
[15:16:01] <vrlogrs> it's outside the loop now
[15:16:02] <shoky> it could be useful  to run that AFTER the loop
[15:16:08] <vrlogrs> i am  :)
[15:16:09] <shoky> k
[15:16:23] <shoky> btw you dont need the .each
[15:16:29] <shoky> $(".log").hover(...);
[15:16:40] <vrlogrs> oh
[15:18:32] <vrlogrs> yes, it works .. except the actual selection ..
[15:18:51] <vrlogrs> http://pastebin.com/WNUsnEV5
[15:18:56] <shoky> also.. .children(..) only looks for _direct_ children
[15:19:03] <shoky> you might want .find() instead
[15:19:08] <vrlogrs> oh ok
[15:21:14] <shoky> don't use visibility:hidden
[15:21:23] <shoky> if you plan to show it with fadeIn
[15:22:30] <vrlogrs> what should it be then?
[15:22:44] <shoky> display:none   if that works for you
[15:23:17] <vrlogrs> yes, it worked
[15:23:21] <vrlogrs> THANKS alot shoky
[15:23:43] <shoky> np
[15:24:03] <ziarkaen> I have a basic "slide-over" menu set up here.  Can anyone suggest how to remove the "bouncing" effect is one mouseover's the whole list too fast?
[15:24:04] <ziarkaen> http://www.beneills.com/new.html
[15:29:46] <shoky> ziarkaen: try .stop(true)   before the .slideDown and .slideUp
[15:30:42] <sadtaco> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=821659 Sigh.
[15:30:52] <sadtaco> Mozilla really pisses me off sometimes (a lot of times).
[15:32:45] <foo> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/jaredhoyt/Ghtbu/1/ - on a site I'm working on, but I'm getting this error on my site: "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'prop' " - any ideas why?
[15:33:44] <shoky> foo: .prop was added in 1.6
[15:34:59] <foo> shoky: uh, I wonder if I have a super old version: http://screencast.com/t/fOLIbkRj
[15:35:16] <shoky> foo: super ;]
[15:39:31] <sadtaco> So what can I use to store lots of data since Mozilla is retarded?
[15:39:36] <sadtaco> What are the limitations on flash storage?
[15:43:12] <sadtaco> Or any other suggestions? I need unlimited storage, basically.  I got it working in Chrome, Safari, and probably works in IE as well by having subdomains.
[15:51:32] <shoky> indexeddb maybe?
[15:51:34] <MobCat> huh?
[15:51:37] <MobCat> what kinda storage?
[15:52:57] <MobCat> oh
[15:53:07] <MobCat> lol curious why do you need to store that much locally?
[15:55:50] <sadtaco> client storage
[15:55:55] <sadtaco> MobCat, logs like irc.
[15:56:01] <sadtaco> Exceed 5mb easy
[15:58:27] <shoky> none of that answers his question ;P
[15:59:06] <tw2113> hosting storage?
[15:59:37] <shoky> nooo i like my clients thick & fat
[16:00:39] <tw2113> their body or their wallet?
[16:00:57] <shoky> certain parts..
[16:00:59] <badrinadh> im having a doubt regarding jquery
[16:01:02] <shoky> .. of their wallet
[16:01:21] <sadtaco> Yeah, every time I ask this question I get into hours long arguments over who you could/should/would need that much data stored on the client, instead of anyone actually answering it.
[16:01:21] <shoky> badrinadh: i suggest 5 hours of deep meditation
[16:01:33] <sadtaco> So I figured out a solution myself except an intentional bug in Firefox blocks it.
[16:01:44] <sadtaco> So now I need to figure out wtf to do as a special case for Firefox.
[16:01:47] <danheberden> "intentional bug"
[16:01:48] <MobCat> you need to store your logs somewhere non local
[16:01:48] <danheberden> i like that
[16:01:53] <MobCat> =p
[16:02:11] <MobCat> every minute off load it to some db
[16:02:12] <sadtaco> MobCat, no I don't have the terabytes.  My server is about 20gb.
[16:02:12] <badrinadh> is it beeter to copy jquery 1.8.3 on our local server or can we just give a link to the jquery website?
[16:02:25] <sadtaco> It has to be client stored. End of discussion there.
[16:02:34] <danheberden> badrinadh: depends on your deployment
[16:02:35] <MobCat> store logs with timestamp, delete continueally if less than 60 minutes
[16:02:52] <danheberden> if you're already concatenating and minifying your js into one file, and it's < 100k, i'd say throw jQuery in there too
[16:03:09] <badrinadh> is there any advantage of having those files on my server?
[16:03:12] <MobCat> setup a trigger on mysql so that it checks
[16:03:14] <danheberden> but either way - google cdn or serving it - as long as it's part of your payload i don't htink you'll see much difference either way
[16:03:15] <sadtaco> No. Omg.  I've been over this far too much I'm not doing it again. Stop trying to tell me to store them on a server.
[16:03:19] <sadtaco> IRC doesn't store your logs on a server.
[16:03:27] <danheberden> badrinadh: well, when you have a local staging copy it's easier
[16:03:30] <MobCat> lol ok keep asking the impossible then
[16:03:35] <shoky> thank fuck IRC is not a webapp
[16:03:38] <sadtaco> It is possible on IE, Safari, Chrome.
[16:03:40] <danheberden> so that you can work on your site on the plane kinda thing
[16:03:45] <MobCat> exactly but not on firefox
[16:03:48] <sadtaco> Yeah
[16:03:56] <sadtaco> Because Mozilla are douchebags and want to promote indexeddb
[16:03:56] <MobCat> so either get with a remote storage solution or warn your users against ff
[16:03:57] <danheberden> badrinadh: are you concatenating and minifying all of your js?
[16:04:04] <sadtaco> By adding an intentional bug to their implementation of localStorage.
[16:04:22] <sadtaco> I'll have to implment indexeddb I guess.
[16:04:26] <MobCat> yep
[16:04:37] <MobCat> it's the way of the web
[16:04:44] <sadtaco> I have to learn a new API and break support for old versions of firefox because Mozilla are douchey.
[16:04:58] <shoky> and you didnt do your research
[16:04:59] <MobCat> on the positive side few programmers want to make their apps that flexible, you'll gain popularity with users for your support
[16:05:00] <sadtaco> I'm pretty sure this intentional bug doesn't exist in Firefox 3.5
[16:05:09] <sadtaco> But don't feel like installing and testing it.
[16:05:23] <MobCat> just user browserstack.com
[16:05:53] <sadtaco> I'm doubting that would reproduce this bug
[16:06:11] <MobCat> support indexdb
[16:06:25] <MobCat> no mas sad taco
[16:06:32] <MobCat> feliz taco
[16:07:01] <badrinadh> as im new with jquery i can't understand much of it... but let me try to explain where i got some doubts.. im running a website and now i want to add some extra features to my webstie so i thought of having jquery and we need to link the source files of js to run our code.. will it give better performance if i copy the source code in my server and give a link to that or just link to jquery website....
[16:07:19] <MobCat> depends on if your server is that crappy
[16:07:26] <danheberden> badrinadh: can you answer my question?
[16:07:26] <sadtaco> The bug is that if you fill up the 5mb limit of localStorage on 1.example.org, despite 2.example.org showing no keys in localStorage it will throw and error that the quota is reached if you try to add a key for it.
[16:07:36] <sadtaco> Mozilla considers example.org as the "domain" for the quota limit.
[16:07:45] <MobCat> you should store your jquery locally usually for a production site
[16:07:46] <sadtaco> When the domain is 2.example.org
[16:07:46] <badrinadh> no
[16:07:58] <danheberden> badrinadh: if you aren't bothering to concat/minify your existing js
[16:08:01] <danheberden> it doesn't matter
[16:08:08] <MobCat> but yea you won't notice a difference probably
[16:08:09] <danheberden> you're asking about a 1% gain/effect
[16:08:15] <danheberden> when you're causing a 99% slowness by NOT doing that
[16:08:23] <MobCat> but what if he stored locally and his box is hosted on an iphone in china?
[16:08:39] <danheberden> it's like you're looking at water injection for your car, but haven't bothered upgrading the intake/exhaust or even putting on the turbo
[16:09:06] <danheberden> or worring what tie to wear with your overalls
[16:09:32] <danheberden> badrinadh: in the end, go with what works best for YOUR dev environemnt
[16:09:45] <MobCat> yea you should play and test
[16:09:55] <badrinadh> thank you
[16:10:00] <danheberden> because, badrinadh, as long as you're concatenating and minifying your JS, whether you serve JS or use the CDN will probably not have any noticable speed improvement
[16:10:19] <danheberden> badrinadh: i would look at grunt - it's a great tool for deployment stuff
[16:10:20] <MobCat> do site tests record how long stuff is taking on loads
[16:10:25] <MobCat> none of us can guess that for you
[16:10:32] <badrinadh> ok
[16:11:32] <MobCat> http://blogs.artinfo.com/culinaryinsiders/files/2011/05/IMG_3923.jpg
[16:11:45] <MobCat> clearly
[16:12:20] <danheberden> MobCat: <3
[16:13:02] <MobCat> stylen
[16:25:18] <sadtaco> lol
[16:25:23] <sadtaco> this browserstack thing
[16:25:37] <sadtaco> It's too slow for me to test this intended bug in older versions of Firefox
[16:27:17] <oojacoboo> if I want to create a global function for event handlers on an object, how would I set that up?  does it need to be a… $.fn.myMethod ?  or can I use a standard function and return the event function?
[16:27:32] <oojacoboo> object.. DOM node
[16:28:10] <oojacoboo> like, I want to setup some specific events for an input that's commonly used through the UI, things like onKeyUp and others
[16:29:49] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. Could use a little help with some AJAX stuff.. totally new to it and I feel like I am ALMOST there, but I don't know how to loop through the data with ajax.
[16:30:15] <sadtaco> okay yeah, it had the bug in firefox 4
[16:30:31] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: look into $.each()
[16:30:39] <tw2113> that's an old Fx
[16:30:45] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  I actually am using that.. I am posting my code now
[16:30:47] <oojacoboo> $.each is?
[16:31:09] <oojacoboo> tw2113 ^^
[16:31:22] <tw2113> ?
[16:31:28] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  I am sure I am somehow using it incorrectly https://gist.github.com/4301439
[16:31:33] <oojacoboo> [19:30] tw2113:	 that's an old Fx
[16:31:41] <tw2113> Fx = Firefox
[16:31:57] <oojacoboo> tw2113: FF = Firefox!
[16:32:04] <tw2113> not according to Mozilla
[16:32:15] <tw2113> if i recall reading right awhile back
[16:32:19] <oojacoboo> who cares about Mozilla
[16:32:19] <danheberden> LindsayMac: one unrelated thing: instead of passing an anonymous function that calls a function as your handler
[16:32:21] <danheberden> just pass the function
[16:32:22] <tw2113> me
[16:32:30] <oojacoboo> Fx = effects or function to me
[16:33:00] <tw2113> f'n chrome snobs :D
[16:33:00] <oojacoboo> never heard Firefox referred to as Fx, but w/e
[16:33:13] <relipse> why is the height not working: $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 1275 });
[16:33:14] <LindsayMac> FF = firefox tw2113 get it straight
[16:33:18] <danheberden> jQuery('#filters a').on( 'click', doAjaxRequest );
[16:33:22] <danheberden> LindsayMac: ^^
[16:33:42] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  thanks.. i am always interested in learning better ways to write my code
[16:33:55] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: use ,done() success is deprecated
[16:34:02] <oojacoboo> .done()*
[16:34:06] <LindsayMac> ok..
[16:34:24] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: also, you don't need to define jQuery so verbosely
[16:34:36] <oojacoboo> $. should suffice unless you have scope issues
[16:34:40] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  i am doing that to avoid conflicts
[16:34:52] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: generally speaking, that's overkill
[16:35:15] <LindsayMac> well $ throws errors, so I was just using jQuery to test since I know it doesnt conflict
[16:35:39] <danheberden> LindsayMac: put your code in an IIFE
[16:35:45] <oojacoboo> danheberden: why are you recommending she bind the event handler?
[16:35:55] <oojacoboo> how do you even know that's an issue?
[16:35:55] <danheberden> (function($){ /* your code that uses $ here */ }(jQuery));
[16:36:06] <LindsayMac> Ok you're both confusing me now..
[16:36:19] <LindsayMac> I appreciate your help, just know that I know PHP VERY well, but new to JS as a whole
[16:36:21] <danheberden> oojacoboo: it is unrelated, i'm just saying instead of .on('click', function(){ someFunction();});
[16:36:30] <tw2113> "Mozilla prefers that Firefox be abbreviated as Fx or fx, though it is often abbreviated as FF." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox
[16:36:30] <tw2113> :D
[16:36:31] <danheberden> it's easier to type  .on('click', someFunction );
[16:36:43] <oojacoboo> danheberden: but she never used on ;)
[16:36:43] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  the reason I had it that was is ULTIMATELY I will have additional stuff in there..
[16:37:00] <danheberden> oojacoboo: ok ".click" if we shall re-inforce the older api
[16:37:08] <danheberden> LindsayMac: gotcha
[16:37:10] <oojacoboo> older?
[16:37:20] <oojacoboo> .click is deprecated?!
[16:37:21] <b-ot> oojacoboo, memorised “click”.
[16:37:21] <tw2113> and i'm done on that topic
[16:37:25] <danheberden> not deprecated, just old
[16:37:29] <danheberden> .on is new and sex
[16:37:29] <b-ot> danheberden, memorised “on”.
[16:37:30] <danheberden> *sexy
[16:37:33] <danheberden> haha
[16:37:38] <danheberden> b-ot, seriously?
[16:37:38] <b-ot> danheberden, concentrate and ask again.
[16:37:40] <oojacoboo> lol
[16:37:45] <relipse> can someone please help me with the jqueryui dialog? the height is not working (being set to "auto") (the width works fine)
[16:37:48] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  I will actually be using isotope with this once I get the data in there that I want.. SO i have that function there to run the isotope one
[16:37:48] <danheberden> forget .on
[16:37:58] <danheberden> b-ot: forget .on
[16:37:58] <b-ot> danheberden, I can’t forget that which I do not know.
[16:38:07] <danheberden> .forget on
[16:38:07] <b-ot> danheberden, I have forgotten “on”. My mind is going, I can feel it.
[16:38:08] <oojacoboo> danheberden: you're crazy man… just craaazy
[16:38:14] <danheberden> jesus christ
[16:38:17] <oojacoboo> .on forget
[16:38:20] <LindsayMac> Well, i'm happy to talk about standards but i'd like to learn why the code I have, doesn't actually pull the content I want.
[16:38:30] <LindsayMac> I have a live examply
[16:38:35] <LindsayMac> example*
[16:38:49] <LindsayMac> http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/
[16:39:02] <oojacoboo> .testcase @ LindsayMac
[16:39:05] <LindsayMac> when i view the network tab on chrome, the link triggers access to my json file
[16:39:13] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo: does the above link work?
[16:39:27] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: can you make a fiddle please
[16:39:31] <oojacoboo> jsfiddle.net
[16:39:51] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  its a wordpress thing and as far as I know (you can correct me) the .ajax doesnt work across different browsers
[16:40:02] <oojacoboo> that's not correct
[16:40:03] <LindsayMac> I mean not browsers..
[16:40:06] <LindsayMac> wow.. i meant to say DOMAINS
[16:40:08] <LindsayMac> sorry..
[16:40:09] <oojacoboo> right
[16:40:11] <oojacoboo> XSS
[16:40:11] <LindsayMac> damn cold medicine
[16:40:24] <oojacoboo> you have to allow it from the receiving domain
[16:40:26] <LindsayMac> So I dont think a fiddle will work.. but the example above is pretty clean
[16:40:35] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: it will if you hardcode the json ;)
[16:40:47] <LindsayMac> I dont even know how to do that.. what do you mean?
[16:40:55] <oojacoboo> var json = {};
[16:41:20] <oojacoboo> the issue isn't your ajax request
[16:41:53] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: also, if you're doing each on data.posts why function(data) and not "posts
[16:41:58] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  if you look at the example I linked to, you can see that the click IS actually getting the json data.. just not loppong the right field?
[16:42:10] <oojacoboo> ^^
[16:42:14] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  i thought I had to tell it to loop for each "post"
[16:42:22] <LindsayMac> http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/category/instagram/?json=1&count=999
[16:42:26] <LindsayMac> ^ that is the output
[16:42:35] <oojacoboo> beautiful
[16:42:41] <oojacoboo> I can read that...
[16:43:19] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  thats the output. If you l ook at the link I gave you above, you can see a more easily readable version in chrome dev tools
[16:43:42] <oojacoboo> I really don't feel like digging to be honest
[16:44:02] <LindsayMac> are you for real? Three clicks?
[16:44:20] <oojacoboo> you must be new here?
[16:44:22] <LindsayMac> I dont know how else to actually cleam that up without looping and outputting it
[16:44:27] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  no. I am not
[16:44:36] <LindsayMac> nor am I new to IRC in general
[16:44:48] <oojacoboo> a fiddle will get you an answer
[16:45:02] <oojacoboo> a website often times will not
[16:45:30] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  as I said.. I know what I am doing when asking for help. I am telling you exactly where to look on the site and the faact that I know the site is clean. I've developed the site myself from scratch
[16:45:45] <LindsayMac> I know php at an advanced level and did not get here by being bad at asking for help
[16:45:54] <oojacoboo> I can't edit your js on your site very easily
[16:46:01] <oojacoboo> make a fiddle or please wait for someone else
[16:46:03] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  right, but at least you can look at it
[16:46:21] <LindsayMac> sometimes, looking at something is / output of something is all that needs to be done
[16:46:38] <joek_> If anyone could help me with my little problem it would be great: http://jsfiddle.net/HdvQv/3/ I am trying to uncheck and disable a checkbox when a radio button is selected. I am not sure why my current code doesn't work.
[16:48:24] <relipse> why is the height not working: $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 1275 });
[16:48:27] <oojacoboo> joek_: http://jsfiddle.net/HdvQv/4/
[16:48:29] <oojacoboo> that works
[16:48:29] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  i'm sorry, but I dont know how to use raw json data and pull form it..
[16:50:32] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  you still around?
[16:50:40] <danheberden> LindsayMac: sure
[16:50:49] <joek_> thank you oojacoboo
[16:51:16] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  i really have no idea how to get all of this data into a fiddle since you can't call json files across domains, but I do have a working demo on my site. Would you midn taking a look?
[16:51:51] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  it could potentially be something REALY simple that just needs a look.. but since i'm new with JSON / data manipulation with JS I am not seeing it
[16:52:24] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: json is an object
[16:52:24] <relipse> jqueryui dialog --> why is the height not working: $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 1275 });
[16:52:33] <oojacoboo> you don't need to use the ajax request
[16:52:37] <oojacoboo> just forget that part of it
[16:52:43] <LindsayMac> if you go here: http://bscphoto.bscdeveloper.com/blog/ and click on "instagram" at the top it SHOULD call in the data
[16:53:00] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  i need to have SOMETHING to loop through in order to test.
[16:53:10] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: also console.log is your friend, log the values in the loop
[16:53:13] <oojacoboo> see what you're getting, etc
[16:53:22] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  I am using that
[16:53:25] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: I already told you though, create a json object
[16:53:28] <LindsayMac> well was..
[16:53:31] <danheberden> or `debugger` or add a breakpoint
[16:53:31] <LindsayMac> have been
[16:53:33] <danheberden> and see all the bars
[16:53:34] <danheberden> *vars
[16:53:42] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11078324/how-to-create-json-object-using-jquery
[16:53:46] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  I am still learning about what/how to use breakpoints
[16:54:07] <danheberden> the easiest part is just find the line you want the JS top stop at
[16:54:12] <danheberden> and the vars will show up on the right
[16:54:17] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo: JS top start?
[16:54:24] <danheberden> (you just click the actual line number to make the breakpoint)
[16:54:29] <oojacoboo> JS top start?
[16:54:54] <LindsayMac> danheberden:  I know that, but I dont really know how to use it to debug entirely
[16:55:15] <LindsayMac> sorry was asking danheberden about "JS top sto"
[16:55:17] <LindsayMac> stop*
[16:56:39] <oojacoboo> LindsayMac: you'd already have this solved if you had just made a fiddle when first asked
[16:57:06] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/emedek/1/edit LindsayMac
[16:57:15] <LindsayMac> oojacoboo:  I am TRYING TO but as I said.. I don't really know how to build a json object and now I am getting MORE errors from simply trying to do that
[16:57:56] <LindsayMac> when chances are, iu've gotten this far, it wouldnt hurt to look at a clean demo URL example
[16:58:40] <LindsayMac> tw2113: thanks. Looking now
[16:59:50] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  perfection!
[17:00:05] <relipse> can someone please help me
[17:00:09] <tw2113> 2 main changes, changed dataType to jsonp
[17:00:14] <LindsayMac> tw2113: so i can see where i was running the each on the wrong function...
[17:00:17] <tw2113> and added the null callback to the url
[17:00:22] <LindsayMac> I see that.
[17:00:27] <tw2113> and the $.each part
[17:00:28] <oojacoboo> tw2113: you really should have made her create the testcase
[17:00:51] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  oojacoboo is the principal of this room.. he's going to smack you with a ruler
[17:00:54] <tw2113> and make her unhappy with me 2 nights in a row?
[17:01:02] <tw2113> pssh
[17:01:07] <tw2113> i'm trying to get back on her good side
[17:01:10] <oojacoboo> tw2113: I don't know about last night… but...
[17:01:12] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  ;)
[17:01:15] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  almost there ;_
[17:01:43] <relipse> hello??
[17:01:50] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  have you ever used the json plugin for WP?
[17:01:51] <tw2113> and i know her enough that she'll at least try to understand what she was doing wrong and learn for later
[17:01:52] <oojacoboo> .ask
[17:01:56] <oojacoboo> !ask
[17:02:04] <oojacoboo> is there a bot anymore?
[17:02:04] <tw2113> [18:52]  <relipse> jqueryui dialog --> why is the height not working: $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 1275 });
[17:02:10] <tw2113> ?ask
[17:02:11] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:03:30] * tw2113 breaks the proverbial ruler
[17:03:37] <LindsayMac> hehe
[17:03:40] <shoky> relipse: worksforme
[17:04:24] <LindsayMac> relipse:  maybe you have some CSS overriding it?
[17:04:41] <tw2113> console errors?
[17:05:16] <tw2113> LindsayMac, are you serving your category feed via json?
[17:05:56] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  I am adding it to the main feed so that when i filter with ISOTOPE I can filter with all of the blog posts without having them load all of the posts on one page
[17:06:03] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  does that even make sense?? LOL
[17:06:24] <tw2113> not completely, but i'll nod my head anyway
[17:06:35] <LindsayMac> its kinda a long convoluted thing, but isotope only filters on HTML elements in the DOM.. obviously so that click function will pull the right posts into the DOM and then let isotope filter them
[17:06:50] <LindsayMac> this way i don't need to have a long ass page with every single post on it for isotope to work
[17:07:15] <tw2113> this is me and you right now LindsayMac http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/9300000/Kermit-Bale-christian-bale-9363776-255-184.gif
[17:07:30] <oojacoboo> lmao
[17:07:54] <shoky> tw2113 is kermit, right
[17:07:56] <LindsayMac> haha yea.. its really convoluted, but I need to just pull in blog posts on the fly without refreshing the page so isotope (you know what that is???) will look all pretty and stuff
[17:08:03] <oojacoboo> tw2113: apparently you didn't take enough Chemistry
[17:08:31] <relipse> hello????
[17:08:32] <relipse> please hlep me
[17:08:38] <LindsayMac> tw2113: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[17:08:39] <oojacoboo> ?asl @ relipse
[17:08:40] <bot-t1> relipse, http://benalman.com/grab/e06f30.png another relationship ruined by jquery (and miketaylr)
[17:08:44] <shoky> ?demo @ relipse
[17:08:45] <bot-t1> relipse, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:08:49] <oojacoboo> lol
[17:09:50] <tw2113> no, i'm not lucky enough to be dating a pig
[17:09:52] <tw2113> hi relipse
[17:09:52] <tw2113> people talked to you
[17:09:53] <tw2113> shoky> relipse: worksforme
[17:09:54] <tw2113> LindsayMac> relipse:  maybe you have some CSS overriding it?
[17:10:54] <tw2113> yeah i've used isotope or similar stuff before
[17:11:05] <tw2113> specifically masonry
[17:11:24] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  So you now how you need items in the DOM in order to filter them down? (it uses data-filter)
[17:11:32] <tw2113> bit of masonry, bit of infinite scroll
[17:11:55] <tw2113> that part i do not know
[17:12:17] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  well the basics is that it targets the class.. I am using php to add the post category to the class of the DOM element
[17:12:49] <LindsayMac> and using infinite scroll, which is just breaking the WP pagination script into a way where you don't reload the page... but they are still individual pages not loaded in the dom until you scroll to them
[17:13:25] <LindsayMac> So a blog post made back in Jan 2012 in the category "instagram"  isn't on the first page, so if i clicked instagram link, it wouldnt filter down to show that one.
[17:13:56] <eip56> dynamically resizing images... thought links to tutorials?
[17:14:58] <oojacoboo> so, I was asking earlier, what's the best method for setting up a global event handler function for a specific element?
[17:15:23] <oojacoboo> I'm trying to setup a global method to handle a search input in particular, with a series of events, in partifular onKeyUp
[17:16:06] <eip56> $(listener).on('event', funciton() )}; oojacoboo
[17:16:19] <oojacoboo> eip56: a global method
[17:16:34] <oojacoboo> $("#id").myGlobalMethod(); for instance
[17:16:52] <oojacoboo> or possible Model.method($id);
[17:17:27] <eip56> .bind()? you can make either of those global
[17:18:08] <oojacoboo> :/
[17:18:25] <shoky> oojacoboo what do you mean..
[17:18:40] <shoky> what do you want $('#id').myGlobalMethod() to do
[17:18:50] <oojacoboo> shoky: setup a series of event handlers
[17:19:05] <shoky> ok?
[17:19:11] <oojacoboo> do I need to return anything on that, or can I just setup directly within that fn?
[17:19:29] <shoky> no idea what you mean
[17:19:40] <oojacoboo> return $(this).keyUp(function(event) {});
[17:20:15] <shoky> it's up to you what to return.. if you want it to be chainable, return this
[17:20:24] <shoky> (or this.keyUp(...) or any other chainable method)
[17:20:25] <oojacoboo> right
[17:20:30] <oojacoboo> thanks
[17:22:56] <oojacoboo> shoky: https://gist.github.com/4301925
[17:23:13] <shoky> no
[17:23:23] <oojacoboo> please elaborate porfavor
[17:23:26] <shoky> this.find  doesn't return the original eleemnt
[17:23:34] <shoky> so you dont want to return that
[17:23:37] <oojacoboo> yea, that's what I was afraid of...
[17:23:56] <shoky> this.find(..).focus(..).blur(..);  return this;
[17:24:04] <oojacoboo> yea, that works
[17:24:07] <oojacoboo> thanks
[17:25:37] <oojacoboo> ugh… I was modifying some old logic and I see what it was trying to do now ><
[17:31:03] <coder7of9> in safari i am trying to load a js fie for highcharts. safari complains it cannot find highcharts (the variable). however if i change the filename from highcharts to zhighcharts it loads. highcharts depends on jquery so load order is important. it needs to load after jquery. is there another way to avert this apparent issue with safari executing onready based on file name?
[17:48:43] <oojacoboo> shoky: https://gist.github.com/4302193
[17:48:51] <oojacoboo> why would the var I am setting break the events?
[17:49:06] <oojacoboo> in other words, if I comment out that var set, the event fire
[17:49:09] <oojacoboo> with it in place, they do not
[17:50:01] <rabx> Hi, I've updated to 1.8.3 and in doing so I've had to update jquery easing to 1.3. After updating easing I've noticed my menu no longer works. The reported error happens when I hover over my lavalamp menu: TypeError: veasing[this.easing] is not a function. I searched my lavalamp.js file and I dont see v.easy nor this.easing
[17:50:24] <oojacoboo> shoky: nm .parent() ><
[17:57:47] <relipse> LindsayMac: oooh
[18:02:17] <relipse> LindsayMac: what CSS would I look for ?
[18:09:02] <rabx> If I am getting a "TypeError: veasing[this.easing]" after updating jquery easing, is this something that can be fixed other than resorting back to an earlier version of easing?
[18:14:45] <relipse> can you just login to http://cworklog.com u: test116 p: test116 and click "Add new work log" and please tell me why changing the height value isn't working: $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 1275 });
[18:17:25] <oojacoboo> relipse: height: auto;
[18:17:44] <oojacoboo> relipse: height: 1275px ?
[18:17:46] <R00tk3y> relipse lol?
[18:17:54] <relipse> oojacoboo: i know why is it doing that
[18:18:00] <oojacoboo> ok
[18:18:00] <R00tk3y> Try
[18:18:01] <R00tk3y> eclipse
[18:18:02] <R00tk3y> lol
[18:18:22] <relipse> the reason i made it 1275 is to see if it changed
[18:18:36] <R00tk3y> Oh LOL
[18:18:37] <relipse> but it didn't
[18:18:39] <R00tk3y> your name is relipse hahha

[18:23:09] <oojacoboo> to the height in the params
[18:23:38] <R00tk3y> Mobile8
[18:23:53] <relipse2> oh i was offline
[18:23:55] <relipse2> ok i'll give it a shot
[18:24:02] <mobile8> R00tk3y: yes
[18:24:08] <R00tk3y> You want to get the position of
[18:24:11] <R00tk3y> top:25px;
[18:24:16] <R00tk3y> or where on the page its located
[18:24:26] <R00tk3y> Relevant top the document?
[18:24:33] <relipse2> $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: '555px' }); it didn't work
[18:24:43] <mobile8> R00tk3y: relevant to the ul
[18:24:47] <mobile8> the top position
[18:24:53] <R00tk3y> Relipse2
[18:24:55] <oojacoboo> mobile8: I think you want .offset() not .position()
[18:24:56] <R00tk3y> width: 258?
[18:25:05] <oojacoboo> .position() will get the position relative to the parent
[18:25:05] <b-ot> oojacoboo, a function, not a property
[18:25:20] <mobile8> oojacoboo: ok but thats probably what i want
[18:25:35] <relipse2> R00tk3y: the width works fine
[18:26:14] <tw2113> ?dialog @ tw2113
[18:26:20] <bot-t1> tw2113, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - jQuery Wiki - A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Dialog
[18:26:27] <R00tk3y> var scrollTop     = $("ul").scrollTop(),
[18:26:27] <R00tk3y>     elementOffset = $('li').offset().top,
[18:26:27] <R00tk3y>     distance      = (elementOffset - scrollTop);
[18:26:55] <mobile8> R00tk3y: lets see
[18:27:18] <mobile8> offset works better yes, but its relative to the document
[18:27:20] <mobile8> not to the ul
[18:27:44] <oojacoboo> right
[18:28:01] <relipse2> can someone please help me with why the height is not working
[18:28:02] <tw2113> $( ".selector" ).dialog({ height: 530 });
[18:28:04] <oojacoboo> you want relative to the ul set position: relative; on the ul, then use .position()
[18:28:05] <relipse2> the height is auto
[18:28:05] <tw2113> from the docs
[18:28:28] <relipse2> can you just login to http://cworklog.com u: test116 p: test116 and click "Add new work log" and please tell me why changing the height value isn't working: $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 1275 });
[18:28:41] <mobile8> oojacoboo: but posijtion doesnt work
[18:29:26] <oojacoboo> ?demo @ mobile8
[18:29:27] <bot-t1> mobile8, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:30:07] <mobile8> the site i am working in is kinda complex
[18:31:10] <mobile8> oh wait
[18:31:21] <mobile8> You can give position() the param of the relative top item
[18:31:23] <tw2113> relipse2, the div with the ID of dlgAddWorkLog has a height of 133px and a width of auto
[18:32:05] <relipse2> tw2113: umm?
[18:32:15] <tw2113> <div id="dlgAddWorkLog" class="ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content" style="width: auto; min-height: 0px; height: 133px;" scrolltop="0" scrollleft="0">
[18:36:13] <relipse2> tw2113: are you using firefox?
[18:36:24] <relipse2> i'm getting height of auto
[18:36:33] <relipse2> either way the jquery height: value is not working
[18:36:45] <tw2113> yes
[18:36:50] <relipse2> I need it to open bigger to show the whole form
[18:36:58] <tw2113> of course i'm using firefox :)
[18:37:14] <relipse2> please help me, use the console
[18:37:56] <tw2113> what do I look like? an IE user?
[18:39:51] <relipse2> no chrome, the whole from doesn't show you have to scroll
[18:39:58] <relipse2> i tried $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 250}); in the console and that worked fine
[18:40:17] <relipse2> maybe I can delay the loading of it
[18:41:07] <relipse2> why would it work fine in the console and not when i'm doing it
[18:41:27] <relipse2> 	  $(document).ready(function() {
[18:41:27] <relipse2>          $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 250});
[18:41:27] <relipse2> 	  });
[18:41:30] <tw2113> dunno
[18:41:31] <relipse2> doesn't work
[18:43:21] <tw2113> i still see the height as 300 in the html tab
[18:44:00] <relipse2> hold on i need to upload
[18:44:05] <relipse2> i'm testing on my local machine
[18:49:32] <relipse2> tw2113: ok test it now
[18:51:12] <tw2113> *shrug*
[18:51:21] <tw2113> never bothered with jQuery UI before
[18:52:20] <relipse2> $(document).ready(function() { $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 250}); }); <--- fails to set the height, if I post the same code in the console AFTER it is loaded it works fine, any ideas?
[18:56:02] <relipse2> hello?
[18:56:51] <tw2113> sometimes, people just don't always know the answer
[18:57:04] <tw2113> plus it's saturday
[19:02:34] <karolyi> relipse2: this should work
[19:03:28] <karolyi> relipse2: can you reproduce the erroe in jsfiddle?
[19:03:33] <karolyi> *error
[19:03:49] <relipse2> karolyi: haha go for it, there is probably too much code
[19:04:27] <karolyi> relipse2: probably a div, some js code and a button which opens the dialog, go for it
[19:08:46] <veQue> those pages that load seemingly forever  as you scroll. is that javascript mostly?
[19:10:01] <relipse2> javascript and ajax
[19:10:25] <relipse2> http://jsfiddle.net
[19:10:37] <karolyi> (save it and then copy the url)
[19:11:28] <veQue> ty
[19:16:45] <relipse2> http://jsfiddle.net/NtvkA/
[19:16:51] <relipse2> ok it works fine in jsfiddle
[19:16:58] <relipse2> but my website breaks the jquery site
[19:17:08] <relipse2> i think i'll just recreate the dialog every time the user opens it
[19:17:28] <karolyi> what is your actual problem?
[19:17:56] <veQue> is there any diff between the two buttons
[19:18:17] <relipse2> when i run $("#dlgAddWorkLog").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 250}); on document ready the height doesn't work
[19:18:42] <relipse2> but if i run it in the console the height does work
[19:19:03] <relipse2> work-around
[19:19:07] <relipse2> instead of using dialog('open')
[19:19:14] <relipse2> i just recreate the dialog every time
[19:21:21] <dcope> is there a way to force a new window to be created? seems like window.open and anchor with _blank only open a new tab :/
[19:21:51] <karolyi> relipse2: i see a height:auto in the initialzed dialog
[19:22:56] <karolyi> dcope: try to init it without an addressbar/toolbar
[19:25:31] <karolyi> relipse2: your dlgDoStuff div gets a lesser height, to compensate the header
[19:26:14] <dcope> karolyi: hm, doens't seem to work either
[19:26:27] <relipse2> karolyi: i know lol but WHY? and How do i get rid of it?
[19:27:44] <karolyi> dcope: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726761/javascript-open-in-a-new-window-not-tab
[19:28:21] <karolyi> relipse2: get rid of what, the header?
[19:29:21] <dcope> karolyi: awesome, the title does it!
[19:30:10] <Suppa_Spic> does anyone know how to omit the "[object Object]" when printing a json object?
[19:30:42] <karolyi> Suppa_Spic: if (typeof variable == 'object') ?
[19:31:26] <Suppa_Spic> alright lemme try that
[19:35:01] <Suppa_Spic> karolyi: didnt work :/
[19:35:20] <karolyi> Suppa_Spic: what exactly are you trying to achieve?
[19:35:23] <delinquentme> so I want to use jquery to add in additional html elements
[19:35:25] <delinquentme> how do?
[19:35:26] <thunderbug> @Suppa_Spic: var myObjectString = "{\n"; for (var memberName in myObject) {myObjectString = " " + memberName + ": " + myObject[memberName] + ",\n"} myObjectString = myObjectString.substr(0, myObjectString.length - 2); myObjectString += "\n}"; console.long(myObjectString);
[19:35:49] <thunderbug> long=log
[19:36:55] <thunderbug> delinquentme: $("#myDiv").html("<p>my new paragraph</p>"); is one option
[19:37:26] <relipse> karolyi: no how do I get rid of "height: auto" which is screwing up my dialog
[19:39:45] <karolyi> relipse: height: auto is a default setting to a div element, what height do you want there?
[19:40:18] <relipse> i want the dialog to be the height that I specify in the constructor
[19:40:40] <relipse> 250 px to be exact
[19:40:54] <rabx> Can I target specific selectors like $("#banner h1") -- would this work?
[19:41:41] <thunderbug> rabx: yes that would select all descendant h1 elements of #banner
[19:41:51] <rabx> perfect
[19:43:04] <karolyi> relipse: in your case, i'd suggest $("#dlgDoStuff").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 255}).parent().height(250)
[19:43:12] <karolyi> eh
[19:43:17] <karolyi> relipse: in your case, i'd suggest $("#dlgDoStuff").dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 258, height: 250}).parent().height(250)
[19:43:58] <karolyi> relipse: however, jquery should calculate the size of your dlgDoStuff div so you won't have to do that basicly
[19:44:05] <thunderbug> relipse: is it possible to try setting the height on the dialog content itself using css or inline style instead of on the dialog itself as a workaround?
[19:48:53] <relipse> karolyi: ok i'll give it a shot thanks
[19:50:28] <Suppa_Spic> karolyi: it worked now, I changed object for "string" instead
[19:51:08] <relipse> karolyi: still didn't work
[19:58:11] <karolyi> fck
[19:58:40] <tw2113> you misspelled fuck
[20:21:18] <karolyi> relipse: try to turn off the resizable property
[20:27:01] <karolyi> relipse: and also, give your dlgAddWorkLog div a fixed width
[20:33:24] <karolyi> relipse: at least 100%, or a pixel value
[22:23:29] <enderx86> Hi. I want a JavaScript Grid framework that allows (1) row grouping and (2) client-side row filtering by some criteria. What's the best framework for these requirements?
[22:37:45] <vladikoff> enderx86, you are probably better off googling and checking out demos
[23:23:25] <justme__> hi
[23:23:37] <justme__> where can i dwnload a 1.8.3 chm ?
[23:26:03] <danheberden> chm?
[23:26:08] <danheberden> like a help file?
[23:26:54] <danheberden> and goddamn it that i know that
[23:28:26] <justme__> danheberden: yes,,
[23:28:38] <justme__> danheberden: share a link? :)
[23:29:19] <danheberden> justme__: i can share *a* link, but we publish no chm
[23:29:24] <danheberden> i assume you mean for the documentation
[23:29:31] <danheberden> the only version of that is api.jquery.com
[23:29:49] <danheberden> maybe you could write one!
[23:29:59] <danheberden> all the docs are at github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[23:30:00] <justme__> danheberden: how about offline htmls for it?
[23:30:22] <danheberden> justme__: well, you *could* run the sites locally using github.com/jquery/web-base-template and the above repo
[23:30:26] <danheberden> but, that would be quite a lot of work
[23:31:00] <danheberden> it'd be nicer to have a offline web version
[23:31:05] <danheberden> that used appcache
[23:33:07] <justme__> danheberden: thats alot of work to setup for a docs/manual.. :(
[23:33:25] <danheberden> justme__: yeah, it's there for us to, you know, actually dev and deploy those sites
[23:33:33] <danheberden> i agree something offline would be helpful
[23:34:05] <danheberden> a chm would be problematic for osx users
[23:34:15] <danheberden> something designed for offline web would be awes
[23:38:08] <kryl> hi,
[23:38:58] <danheberden> howdy kryl
[23:39:27] <kryl> how to get the ID of div around an element ? <div id="test"><p id="for"></p></div> I know id of p and I want to get the div id from this information.
[23:39:43] <kryl> danheberden, ;)
[23:39:56] <danheberden> kryl: you can get that div a couple ways
[23:39:59] <tw2113> $('#for').parent().attr('id');
[23:40:01] <danheberden> .parent() would give you the parent
[23:40:01] <b-ot> danheberden, a function, not a property
[23:40:08] <danheberden> oh b-ot
[23:40:15] <danheberden> kryl: also .closest('div')
[23:40:41] <kryl> and if there is many things like <div id="wanted"><span><span><p id="for"></span></span></div>
[23:40:48] <prasanth_g> hello
[23:40:51] <danheberden> kryl: that's what closest would do
[23:40:55] <danheberden> get the closest 'div', in that case
[23:41:05] <kryl> ok thank you
[23:41:10] <kryl> I'm testing immediately :)
[23:41:11] <danheberden> sup prasanth_g
[23:41:17] <danheberden> ?closest @ kryl
[23:41:18] <bot-t1> kryl, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:41:25] <danheberden> good reading ^
[23:41:28] <kryl> thanks danheberden
[23:41:34] <prasanth_g> is there anything like "is active" in jquery to do something when an element is active?
[23:41:39] <danheberden> parent and parents are both worth looking at too
[23:41:50] <danheberden> prasanth_g: what do you mean by "Active"
[23:41:53] <danheberden> when it has focus?
[23:41:57] <danheberden> ?focus @ prasanth_g
[23:41:58] <bot-t1> prasanth_g, .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[23:42:32] <prasanth_g> yes
[23:42:40] <danheberden> then tada!
[23:42:53] <prasanth_g> i'm using jquery rotating script
[23:43:24] <prasanth_g> so, if i hover an element, it must pause and i had achieved it using .hover event handler
[23:43:39] <prasanth_g> but if we done action on the same element, it must pause
[23:43:53] <prasanth_g> so, i can use focus?
[23:44:15] <danheberden> or maybe just click?
[23:44:21] <danheberden> it's your site :p
[23:44:41] <danheberden> you can also use ?blur to check when focus leaves
[23:44:42] <bot-t1> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[23:44:45] <prasanth_g> yes, when we click, it must pause for a while
[23:44:52] <kryl> does :input selector include select ?
[23:44:59] <danheberden> kryl: aye
[23:45:32] <prasanth_g> thx dan
[23:45:38] <danheberden> kryl: though you could just do 'select, input, textarea'
[23:45:43] <danheberden> whatevs is easiest for you
[23:46:57] <kryl> danheberden, not bad ;) thx
[23:50:15] <k1ng> !up webmentbd.com
[23:51:47] <prasanth_g> here is the code dan
[23:51:48] <prasanth_g> http://pastebin.com/M3K30w2Z
[23:52:12] <prasanth_g> when we hover, it will clear the timer and when we unhover, it starts timer
[23:52:39] <prasanth_g> similarly, when we perform action(click, focus), it clears timer and starts again
[23:52:57] <prasanth_g> but, when this timer starts again?
[23:53:17] <ravenzz> morning
[23:53:21] <prasanth_g> as it is focus which is activated for a while
[23:53:34] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[23:53:52] <ravenzz> should it rotate until it doesn't lose the focus/hover whatever?
[23:54:08] <prasanth_g> i want the jquery rotating script to pause the element when hovered or clicked
[23:54:32] <ravenzz> is "jquery rotating script" a plugin?
[23:54:37] <prasanth_g> yes
[23:54:43] <ravenzz> link?
[23:54:48] <ravenzz> don't they have documentation?
[23:55:20] <prasanth_g> but nothing mentioned for what i need
[23:55:42] <prasanth_g> http://pastebin.com/M3K30w2Z
[23:55:42] <ravenzz> so you should create a testcase on jsfiddle.net or similar
[23:55:49] <ravenzz> a plain text past won't help
[23:55:53] <prasanth_g> ok
[23:56:08] <ravenzz> meanwhile could you give me
[23:56:18] <ravenzz> the plugin's website link?
