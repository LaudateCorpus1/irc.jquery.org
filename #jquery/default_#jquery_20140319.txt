[00:00:57] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: the width of one of the parents are too small
[00:02:02] <Abbbbbbhi> But it working properly inenglish language
[00:02:30] <Cork> Abbbbbbhi: so the language takes less space
[00:02:46] <Cork> or possibly the browser counts the font dimensions wrong
[00:04:09] <baconisgood>  im trying to use a rotate plugin on data that I loaded in via XML and appended as html with jquery, but the problem being is the rotate plugin no matter which I use can't see the html any ideas how to fix it?
[00:12:42] <timothy_mccallum> Would you like to write a Wordpress plug-in for Google Summer of Code 2014? http://techteam.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/write-a-wordpress-plug-in-for-google-summer-of-code-2014/
[01:46:15] <edsu> anyone know why this might work in firefox but not in chrome?
[01:46:22] <edsu> $.ajax({url: 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F1361946042000227715', headers: {'Accept': 'application/rdf+xml'}, success: function(data) {console.log(data);}})
[01:47:27] <edsu> the request for that url redirects to another url, firefox seems to reuse the Accept header for that request, but chrome does not :|
[01:48:17] <Cork> edsu: define works
[01:48:23] <Cork> ah
[01:50:48] <edsu> yeah, sorry :-) works = the console.log(data) prints out a xml document in the console without a 406 (Not Acceptable) http error
[01:51:41] <Cork> edsu: might be exactly what you said, chrome drops the accept header when it gets a redirect
[01:51:59] <Cork> edsu: js has no control over redirects, it is all handled by the browser
[01:53:53] <Fernandos> hi
[01:56:11] <Fernandos> why is stop(true,true).fadeIn(); acting "jumpy" or artificially delayed? Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=5snT3BGK
[01:59:21] <edsu> Cork: thanks
[02:13:41] <Fernandos> k fixed.. wasn't that code, but something else
[02:16:03] <TheJHNZ> When using show() to show an element over 4000px i seem to get some performance issues in chrome, does anyone know how to fix this ?
[02:16:42] <TheJHNZ> v 2.0.2
[02:17:02] <TheJHNZ> oh 2.1 is out :o
[02:18:12] <TheJHNZ> upgraded and still the same
[02:19:12] <TheJHNZ> The issue doesnt happen in ff
[02:19:34] <TheJHNZ> or IE
[02:20:09] <Fernandos> TheJHNZ: http://www.learningjquery.com/2010/05/now-you-see-me-showhide-performance/
[02:20:57] <Fernandos> Also it's possibly because gpu-rendering is enabled in ffx and ie by default, but in chrome only if your gpu isn't blacklisted...
[02:21:52] <fabioportieri> good morning
[02:23:59] <Fernandos> TheJHNZ: 4000px is fairly large, I think sluggishness should be expected at that size, unless you've a very fast machine. There are a few jsperf tests you could also check, other than this http://jsperf.com/check-element-viz-before-hide
[02:34:41] <TheJHNZ> http://joshua.geek.nz/s/JHNZ22-34-39.png
[02:34:45] <TheJHNZ> ff vs chrome
[02:35:15] <Fernandos> what's the most used jquery url/cdn?
[02:35:43] <Cork> Fernandos: code.jquery.com and ajax.googlecode.com
[02:36:06] <Fernandos> Cork: any stats on the git1 version?
[02:36:15] <Cork> git1?
[02:36:33] <Fernandos> or http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git2.min.js
[02:36:40] <Cork> ah
[02:36:40] <Fernandos> that's what I currently use
[02:36:46] <Cork> don't think so, but donno
[02:37:03] <TheJHNZ> is there an isnt('visable') ?
[02:37:04] <Cork> Fernandos: i wouldn't use the git in production though
[02:37:09] <TheJHNZ> or would you use hidden ?
[02:37:17] <Cork> TheJHNZ: !$().is(':visible)
[02:37:25] <Cork> *!$().is(':visible')
[02:38:22] <TheJHNZ> thanks
[02:38:32] <TheJHNZ> is there a way to see events that are happening with firebug or such ?
[02:38:46] <TheJHNZ> like if a show is triggered etc
[02:39:15] <Cork> possible, i usually use console.log so haven't looked
[02:39:23] <TheJHNZ> oh true
[02:39:25] <Cork> seeing all the events that exist would be a flood
[02:39:39] <Cork> so would not be fun filtering through that
[02:40:35] <fabioportieri> there should be firequery for that
[02:41:00] <fabioportieri> maybe this works too $._data(document.getElementById('elementid'), "events");
[02:42:10] <TheJHNZ> ondragover is constantly checked hmm..
[02:42:28] <TheJHNZ> http://joshua.geek.nz/s/JHNZ22-42-26.png
[02:42:37] <TheJHNZ> this is what happens on drag
[02:43:23] <TheJHNZ> it triggers the ondragleave when my overlay shows
[02:43:30] <TheJHNZ> but my overlay has pointer-events off
[02:54:15] <TheJHNZ> http://i.imgur.com/TW2IBPU.gif
[02:55:05] <TheJHNZ> is there a way to stop the events ?
[03:20:14] <ns5> how to label an html element? id or class, which one is faster to locate using jquery?
[03:22:10] <systemfault> ns5: By IDs used to be a lot faster... but nowadays both IDs and Classes are fast.
[03:22:22] <systemfault> In fact... sizzle is slow at this point :P
[03:22:36] <systemfault> If the speed is critical, use pure DOM instead of jQuery.
[03:22:49] <systemfault> (Hint: It pretty much never is)
[03:23:10] <ns5> use DOM is a pain, I'm using jquery mobile
[03:23:41] <systemfault> Then just use jQuery... and don't be stupid with selectors.
[03:24:05] <systemfault> Like... cache your results in variables instead of reselecting the nodes everytime when you can.
[03:30:56] <titii> Hi there, I have on the page two versions of jQuery, second is loaded as var $j1102 = jQuery.noConflict(true); so the old one works on $ and the new on $j1102, right?
[03:31:09] <titii> now i need to use autocomplete from the ui, so i loaded two library, jquery.ui and jquery.autocomplete, how to colaborate with that to use the new version od jquery? - $j1102 ?
[03:31:17] <titii> I have to replace all $ in that two libraries by $j1102 ?
[03:37:20] <Cork> titii: you really shouldn't use two versions of jquery on the same page
[03:37:25] <Cork> it is asking for problems
[03:37:39] <Cork> titii: but the plugin for the first lib needs to load before the second one
[03:37:59] <Cork> titii: cause after the second one loads you can't add things to with how plugins are designed
[03:38:34] <Cork> titii: noConflict is meant to help if you have another library using $, it doesn't fully cover using two jquery versions
[03:39:07] <Cork> titii: the reason for the problem is that plugins will attach to the global variable jQuery
[03:39:20] <Cork> titii: and that is why things won't really work
[03:42:48] <Parsi> $(_tr).hide().insertAfter("#startPoint").fadeIn('slow', function () { //foo}); here, how can I access newly added object?
[03:43:18] <Cork> Parsi: newly added?
[03:43:25] <Parsi> it's a table row
[03:43:31] <Cork> ah _tr is a string?
[03:43:43] <Parsi> Cork: yes, <tr>..</tr>
[03:43:58] <Cork> Parsi: this should be the dom element animated
[03:44:06] <Parsi> yes
[03:44:48] <Parsi> I'm trying to highlight its background after adding
[03:45:06] <titii> Cork: i, see, ty for descibe. so what u can advice me? is here some some autocomplete for 1.2.6?
[03:46:32] <Cork> titii: you would have to grab a version of jquery ui that supports 1.2.6
[03:46:53] <Cork> titii: but 1.2.6 is dead old, you should try to update
[03:47:10] <Parsi> Cork: :last-child would help?
[03:47:23] <Cork> Parsi: no
[03:47:35] <Cork> Parsi: why doesn't $(this).css() work?
[03:47:42] <Cork> or $(this).addClass()
[03:47:48] <titii> Cork: is here problem to update, because of some depricated functions and they wont to make update
[03:48:05] <sunbeam> hi, does anyone see problems when an iframe (twitter widget) is displayed inside another iframe?
[03:48:14] <Cork> titii: like what depricated functions?
[03:48:19] <Parsi> Cork: $(_tr).hide().insertAfter("#startPoint").fadeIn('slow', function () { //foo}); here $(this) refers to which?
[03:48:26] <Cork> titii: most of those is trivial to replace
[03:48:38] <Cork> titii: and there is a jquery-migrate for the rest of them
[03:48:51] <Parsi> inside the function()
[03:49:00] <Cork> Parsi: ah, you mean _tr is multiple rows?
[03:49:16] <Cork> took it for one based on the name
[03:49:18] <Parsi> Cork: no, it's single row
[03:49:25] <Cork> then i don't follow
[03:49:35] <Cork> this refers to the tr
[03:50:02] <Parsi> since I add it after #startPoint, .next() would help, right?
[03:50:14] <Cork> huh?
[03:50:24] <Cork> so you don't want to set it on the element you append?
[03:51:13] <Parsi> Cork: I append new element, exactly after #startPoint
[03:51:19] <Cork> ya?
[03:51:34] <Parsi> so $("#startPoint").next() refers to it
[03:51:43] <Cork> uh
[03:51:49] <Cork> i really down follow
[03:51:59] <Cork> $(_tr) parses the html and makes a tr dom element
[03:52:08] <Cork> then you insert it after startPoint
[03:52:13] <Cork> and the you fade it in
[03:52:20] <Cork> after that you want to work with another element?
[03:52:47] <Cork> down follow == don't follow
[03:53:35] <Parsi> no, I want to work it, the new element that I added
[03:53:44] <Cork> then just use "this"
[03:55:29] <Parsi> Cork: thanks
[04:05:46] <funhouse> Hey there, using ajax setup, have dataType set to 'json', the ajax script has application/json as the content type, the script is echoing {}, responseJSON is not showing up, any ideas?
[04:08:11] <funhouse> bizarre why wouldnt this work
[04:08:51] <hxm> is not possible to make a ajax request cross domain?
[04:09:22] <hxm> i dont have access to the webhosting
[04:12:02] <systemfault> hxm: Nope, unless the server sends valid CORS headers.... or if it has JSONP hooks.
[04:33:16] <slax0r> :q
[04:33:19] <slax0r> eh..
[04:33:41] <fabioportieri> slax0r: you wish
[04:34:09] <slax0r> I wish for alot of things
[04:34:21] <slax0r> but write vim commands in irssi is not it
[04:34:56] <fabioportieri> rhrh
[04:35:00] <fabioportieri> i mean, eheh
[04:36:45] <funhouse> Hey there, using ajax setup, have dataType set to 'json', the ajax script has application/json as the content type, the script is echoing {}, responseJSON is not showing up, any ideas?
[04:46:59] <Parsi> <tr id="tr-helper" style="background-color:red;"><td colspan="7">&nbsp;</td></tr> I have this, but $("#tr-helper").height(); returns 0
[04:48:35] <jphase> Parsi: what about $('#tr-helper td').height() ?
[04:49:12] <Parsi> let me try it
[04:49:35] <Parsi> jphase: 0 again
[04:49:45] <fabioportieri> Parsi: is it inside document.ready?
[04:49:55] <Parsi> yes fabioportieri
[04:50:19] <Parsi> it's inside <thead>
[04:50:42] <Parsi> it was returning some value couple of minutes ago
[04:51:02] <jphase> Parsi: something is funny then:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6HHD9/
[04:51:55] <Parsi> yes :|
[04:52:45] <jphase> Parsi: it will return null if it's not inside a <table>
[04:52:53] <jphase> I assume you're inside <table><tbody> yes?
[04:53:09] <Parsi> jphase: yes
[04:53:47] <ankurk_> Is there any way I can check page refresh?
[04:53:49] <jphase> is it dynamically inserted into the DOM or something?
[04:54:05] <jphase> ankurk_: not sure what you mean by "check page refresh"
[04:54:28] <ankurk_> I want to check the if the current page has been refresh or not
[04:54:29] <Parsi> jphase: no
[04:54:48] <systemfault> ankurk_: Some browsers have a "beforeunload" event
[04:55:05] <systemfault> ankurk_: The event will be trigger if the person tries to leave the page.
[04:55:11] <systemfault> *triggered
[04:55:32] <jphase> ankurk_: you could also set a cookie or something too and see if that cookie has been set but it's kind of a mess :\
[04:55:48] <ankurk_> What if I want to check page has been refreshed already?
[04:56:38] <ph88> ankurk_: how do you know if it's "unfresh" ?
[04:57:36] <jphase> you could set/unset/reset a cookie each time the page is loaded that contains the URL of the document which would tell you if you have refreshed the page
[04:57:58] <untaken> is this correct? <script type="text/javascript" src="//#code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
[04:58:08] <untaken> if I don't use #// firefox complains
[04:58:21] <jphase> the # shouldn't be there
[04:58:53] <ankurk_> Cookies are messy :/
[04:58:59] <jphase> agreed
[05:01:09] <untaken> jphase: yea, but firefox then states this: Warning: SyntaxError: Using //@ to indicate sourceMappingURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead
[05:02:38] <hxm> hello, i want to create a div which contains a piece of html code
[05:02:56] <hxm> how can i do that? var myvar = '<tags and stuff><script>javascript code>';
[05:10:00] <fabioportieri> hxm: $("<div>").append("<p>sksjkjds</p>").appendTo("body");
[05:10:31] <hxm> but the javascript code contains symbols that gives me errors
[05:10:54] <fabioportieri> hxm: you have to include jquery ?
[05:11:07] <hxm> not really
[05:11:21] <hxm> that part is not a jquery code (i use jquery globally) but not in that part
[05:11:32] <fabioportieri> what part?
[05:12:20] <hxm> $('#new_div').html('here');
[05:12:38] <hxm> 'here' is a <form> and a <script> that send the ajax
[05:13:21] <fabioportieri> nested <script> tags is a no-no
[05:13:59] <hxm> oh
[05:14:14] <hxm> so what to do if i need to add a new element with its own piece of code
[05:14:28] <jphase> also, it'd be best to use .ajax instead of append a script tag with ajax calls in it
[05:14:30] <Cork> hxm: just have the code in the normal tag
[05:14:53] <hxm> ok
[05:15:10] <Cork> hxm: you should separate javascript from html
[05:15:20] <Cork> html should just represent the data
[05:15:21] <hxm> yes, i think thats the origin of my problem
[05:15:34] <Cork> then you use css to style the data
[05:15:42] <Cork> and lastly apply js to make thing happen
[05:17:03] <juxta_> I'm using .html() to update the contents of a div. this works just fine, but if the html i insert makes references to styles, these do not appear to be rendered by my browser. any ideas where I might be going wrong?
[05:17:28] <Parsi> how can increase height of something animated?
[05:17:52] <Cork> juxta_: you prob need to include the needed css files
[05:17:52] <Parsi> its height + some intervals
[05:17:56] <Cork> *resources
[05:18:18] <juxta_> Cork: the stylesheets are linked, other styles in them work just fine
[05:18:19] <Cork> Parsi: .animate({ heihgt: 'value' }, time)
[05:18:32] <Parsi> Cork: 'value' is not absolute
[05:18:44] <Parsi> does it support {height:+=50}
[05:18:46] <Cork> Parsi: += then
[05:18:47] <Parsi> something like this
[05:18:47] <juxta_> Cork: even if I run a selector looking for the style in question, I get nothing back
[05:18:53] <Cork> '+=value'
[05:19:15] <Cork> selector lookning for the style?
[05:19:21] <juxta_> erm
[05:19:26] <Cork> juxta_: on document.styleShreets?
[05:19:28] <juxta_> $('.style')
[05:19:36] <Cork> huh?
[05:19:52] <Cork> that is an element selector, it has nothing to do with styles
[05:20:25] <juxta_> Cork: right, but it can select based on style, can it not?
[05:20:45] <Cork> juxta_: it selects element based on a css selector
[05:21:18] <Cork> juxta_: it isn't related to the style rules defined in the css file
[05:21:20] <juxta_> ugh. I see what i'm doing. i've been up too long. let me see if it's a matter of a simple typo.
[05:22:08] <m1chael> does anyone see anything obviously wrong with this line of code? $("li[data-id=" + sighting_id + "] > button.like_button").addClass("ui-btn-active");
[05:22:23] <juxta_> Cork: yeah. I have been. my js was inserting <div style="classname">.
[05:22:39] <Cork> m1chael: you should have '' or "" around the value for the attribute selector
[05:22:57] <Cork> juxta_: ouch
[05:24:10] <Cork> so $("li[data-id='" + sighting_id + "'] > button.like_button").addClass("ui-btn-active");
[05:24:11] <m1chael> Cork, this isn't working either: $("#myPage > div.ui-panel-wrapper > div > ul:nth-child(3) > li > p:nth-child(5) > button.like_button.ui-btn.ui-icon-heart.ui-btn-icon-left.ui-btn-inline.ui-mini").addClass("ui-btn-active");
[05:24:32] <Cork> m1chael: are you sure nth-child is what you want there?
[05:24:54] <Cork> m1chael: p:nth-child(5) means grab the fifth element if it is a p
[05:25:00] <Cork> not grab the fifth p element
[05:25:08] <m1chael> well, the first one is more of what i want.. the second one is copied from google chrome web tools copy CSS path
[05:25:21] <m1chael> i'm just trying to understand why i can't set this button to "active"
[05:25:53] <Cork> m1chael: try console.log($("#myPage > div.ui-panel-wrapper > div > ul:nth-child(3) > li > p:nth-child(5) > button.like_button.ui-btn.ui-icon-heart.ui-btn-icon-left.ui-btn-inline.ui-mini").length)
[05:26:46] <m1chael> i get 0 length i believe
[05:26:59] <Cork> so it doens't find the element
[05:27:22] <Cork> m1chael: you might be running the selector before the element is added
[05:27:43] <m1chael> i'm trying to fire this code on a button click.. http://infobuzz.me/static/test
[05:28:07] <m1chael> switch back and forth between like/report false
[05:28:43] <m1chael> your line was added line 107
[05:31:15] <Cork> ugg you use font tags? >_<
[05:31:49] <m1chael> my coworker does, trying to break him of it
[05:33:51] <Cork> m1chael: something like $('button[data-id="' + sighting_id + '"].dislike_button') ?
[05:44:37] <m1chael> ah, the problem might be because selectors have to begin with a-Z?
[05:44:55] <Cork> no
[05:44:55] <m1chael> er,ids
[05:45:29] <m1chael> you sure? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5787746/jquery-variable-as-id-selector-not-working
[05:45:58] <Cork> m1chael: http://jsfiddle.net/8PEnv/
[05:45:58] <Cork> yes
[05:46:42] <Cork> m1chael: you should not use so as a source of knowledge it is riddled with errors
[05:46:58] <m1chael> okay
[05:48:02] <martinklepsch> hey
[05:48:25] <martinklepsch> I'm thinking of using this to build some kind of onboarding guide for our product: https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#fullpagejs
[05:48:37] <m1chael> my variable is data-id and not id
[05:48:44] <martinklepsch> basically it's a good start but I
[05:49:04] <Cork> m1chael: that means it even less restricted
[05:49:19] <martinklepsch> 'd like to make sure people only get to the next section when they completed a previous one. — any advice how to do that or similar plugins in mind?
[05:49:35] <Cork> m1chael: http://jsfiddle.net/8PEnv/1/
[05:49:46] <Cork> m1chael: also i used your attributes for the selector i wrote for you
[05:50:52] <ocx> $('#switcher button').removeClass('selected'); $(this).addClass('selected');   here (this) refers to $('#switcher button') ?

[06:02:29] <bengalo> your this has nothing to do with the function call before that
[06:02:40] <bengalo> its the parent function that supplies the this
[06:02:54] <bengalo> the click event or whatever
[06:04:21] <ocx> bengalo:  didnt get it
[06:05:51] <m1chael> hey Cork, your example worked great. I apologize it took me so long to figure out what you were talking about
[06:06:05] <Cork> m1chael: np
[06:06:42] <Cork> ocx: no this refers to the element in the event handler works on (if that is the context)
[06:07:20] <bengalo> ocx paste the whole event you took that line from

[06:10:40] <Cork> while this is only the specificly clicked one
[06:10:48] <Cork> murosai_: no
[06:11:03] <Cork> murosai_: it filter the set of matched elements
[06:11:04] <murosai_> it just returns the filtered list?
[06:11:08] <Cork> yes
[06:11:17] <murosai_> okay, so how can i actually filter and remove?
[06:11:19] <ocx> Cork: so mainly $('#switcher button').removeClass('selected'); can be $(this).removeClass('selected');
[06:11:21] <ocx> right?
[06:11:34] <Cork> murosai_: invert the filter and do $().filter().remove()
[06:11:50] <Cork> ocx: if you only want to affect the button you clicked
[06:11:56] <Cork> ocx: and not any of the other
[06:12:13] <ocx> yes so they are identfical
[06:12:17] <Cork> no
[06:12:19] <ocx> dunno why they didnt use this on line 14
[06:12:51] <murosai_> Cork: what does $() do? match all elements?
[06:13:07] <Cork> murosai_: it is a short hand for $(document).find()
[06:13:23] <Cork> it builds a list of elements based on your selector string
[06:13:24] <murosai_> okay so basically returns all elements
[06:13:33] <Cork> that matches the selector yes
[06:14:46] <Cork> ocx: this should explain what the difference between those two lines are http://jsfiddle.net/9tF8N/
[06:27:09] <Fernandos> What's the correct selector to get the value from the lang attribute? <html lang="en"> It seems $("html[lang=*]").val(); is wrong..
[06:29:29] <Fernandos> k, seems $("html").attr('lang'); does the job too..
[06:30:11] <Cork> ya
[06:30:20] <Cork> or just document.documentElement.lang
[06:39:07] <SprkDev> I am using bootstrap modal and its almost working.
[06:39:27] <SprkDev> only problem is when the modal loads, it loads the entire page including the header and the footer.
[06:39:39] <SprkDev> is it possible to select the div from the other page that I want loaded.
[06:39:44] <SprkDev> ?
[06:40:59] <Cork> SprkDev: your meant to load fragments when you use inpage solutions
[06:41:19] <Cork> SprkDev: what you might be able to do is use the url selector hack
[06:41:32] <Cork> if bootstrap uses jquery .load
[06:52:44] <airdem> SprkDev, $(data).find('#container > *')
[06:56:47] <murosai_> how can i return from an ajax call? at least i assume the call has to be synchronous but even after setting async: false it doesn't seem to work
[06:57:17] <Cork> murosai_: you don't want to have sync ajax calls
[06:57:31] <Cork> murosai_: those will frees the browser until the response from the server comes back
[06:57:52] <Cork> murosai_: also they only exist for legacy sites, and arn't getting new features
[07:00:18] <lianzinho> guys… how to wrap each group of class .item_1 in a new div? http://jsfiddle.net/3BRvY/
[07:00:50] <Cork> ?api wrap
[07:00:50] <b-ot> Cork: .wrap(): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[07:01:55] <rbu> not being able to login at http://bugs.jquery.com/ is a known bug?
[07:02:13] <lianzinho> Cork: yes… but I want to wrap around a group of item_1, not around each
[07:02:28] <Cork> ?api wrapAll
[07:02:29] <b-ot> Cork: .wrapAll(): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[07:03:24] <lianzinho> Cork: wrapAll will make a div with ALL the .item_1, I want to keep each parent, did you see the HTML structure?
[07:03:43] <Cork> uh...
[07:03:51] <Cork> you want to wrap it but keep the parents?!?
[07:04:13] <lianzinho> do you see the .container?
[07:04:20] <Cork> ya?
[07:04:24] <lianzinho> each one has some elements
[07:04:58] <lianzinho> I want to wrap these but keeping them inside the current parent
[07:05:13] <Cork> so wrap them
[07:05:15] <lianzinho> will make an example in the end… wait a minute
[07:05:57] <lianzinho> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/3BRvY/1/
[07:06:05] <lianzinho> like this...
[07:06:20] <lianzinho> I tried use .each(), but did not work
[07:06:23] <Cork> uh, that isn't keeping the parent...
[07:06:36] <ocx> hi all, i am trying to query a website for data and retrieve it in jquery for some reason it doesnt work , any idea? http://pastebin.com/agwCQzj2
[07:06:52] <Cork> $(section).wrap('<div class="wrapped"></div>')
[07:06:54] <Cork> will do that
[07:07:09] <lianzinho> yes, this group of .item_1 are still inside the Container, but wrapped
[07:07:16] <Cork> ...
[07:07:27] <drej> ocx CORS
[07:07:44] <ocx> drej: sorry?
[07:07:47] <drej> ocx you need proper cross domain policies to get data from another domain
[07:07:50] <drej> its called CORS
[07:08:00] <drej> googlie it
[07:08:11] <Cork> lianzinho: http://jsfiddle.net/3BRvY/2/
[07:08:11] <ocx> drej: how can i do that
[07:08:17] <drej> ...
[07:08:22] <BillCriswell> ...
[07:08:28] <ocx> ...
[07:08:44] * Cork plays checker
[07:08:46] <drej> ocx google it.
[07:08:49] <lianzinho> Cork: but I want to do that to each group, gotcha?
[07:08:51] <drej> its got nothing to do with javascript
[07:08:57] <drej> and it depends hugely on the server the site is hosted on
[07:09:00] <drej> there's no singular solution
[07:09:05] <lianzinho> all of the containers and its children
[07:09:06] <Cork> lianzinho: so select each group you want
[07:09:30] <lianzinho> Cork: that's what I'm asking, how? :D
[07:09:38] <ocx> drej: if i try the http://...jsonlink it works fine on the browser
[07:09:42] <ocx> but not through jquery
[07:10:01] <drej> so you're not going to google it ?
[07:10:04] <lianzinho> if I use wrapAll it will group them outside their parent
[07:10:04] <Cork> lianzinho: $('.container').each(function() { $('.item_1').wrapAll('<div>') })
[07:10:14] <Cork> opps
[07:10:21] <Cork> lianzinho: $('.container').each(function() { $(this).find('.item_1').wrapAll('<div>') })
[07:10:27] <BillCriswell> drej: IF there was evern an appropriate use for lmgtfy, I think it's now.
[07:10:31] <lianzinho> ah
[07:10:31] <ocx> drej: googling cors jquery
[07:10:37] <lianzinho> maybe the find
[07:10:42] <drej> nope, just cors, like i said it has nothing to do with jquery
[07:11:15] <drej> ocx basically you have to go on the server you're getting the data FROM, and set up the server to allow other domains to grab data via xh requests ("ajax") from the server
[07:11:18] <drej> by default this is not allowes
[07:11:19] <drej> allowed
[07:11:22] <ocx> $.support.cors = true;
[07:11:29] <drej> so that you cant just randomly grab the data from any site you want
[07:11:44] <Cork> ocx: that is if the browser supports it
[07:11:47] <ocx> why using http://myserver/jsonapi works?
[07:11:54] <Cork> ocx: not if the server allows it
[07:12:04] <Cork> ocx: cause it isn't cors
[07:12:07] <drej> beacuse its on the same domain
[07:12:11] <Cork> ?g mdn cors
[07:12:21] <b-ot> Cork: HTTP access control (CORS) - HTTP | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[07:13:30] <BillCriswell> Wonder why Cross Origin Resource Sharing isn't in the title.
[07:14:04] <lianzinho> Cork: it its possible do unwrap ? hehehe
[07:14:33] <Cork> lianzinho: you might want to do this in css instead
[07:15:24] <lianzinho> Cork: I really need a wrapper around things…
[07:15:47] <Cork> lianzinho: http://jsfiddle.net/3BRvY/3/
[07:15:53] <paulvd> is there a plugin for google map driving directions?
[07:16:21] <Cork> lianzinho: not sure you do actually
[07:16:38] <Cork> lianzinho: but give the need and i might accept you claim :)
[07:17:55] <lianzinho> Cork: my example was just to ask how do wrap each group… I'm implementing a search plugin and I need the scope where it will search the items… so I need to change the wrapper around items according to some parameters
[07:18:18] <Cork> lianzinho: so just do a scope though $()
[07:18:34] <Cork> no need to physically add it to the dom
[07:19:34] <lianzinho> Cork: yeah. don't really know how to do it yet.. have to try some stuff
[07:19:40] <lianzinho> but thanks anyway
[07:19:43] <lianzinho> :)
[07:31:20] <NCS_One> hi
[07:34:39] <v0id3d> ello ello
[07:34:53] <NCS_One> just to confirm, when printing some css styles are not used to print right?
[07:37:21] <v0id3d> i guess to make a print friendly print some of them couldnt be used
[07:41:32] <axilaris> hi, anyone knows how can i put event onkeypress into this tag ?   <%= text_field_tag("price", "", :style => "width:60px") %>
[07:42:01] <ocx> drej: so CORS works as follow: example: if i my browser accesses websiteA and on WebsiteA i have some img pointing to websiteB, by default that would not work unless the websiteA is loaded in the accepted origin servers on the websiteB webserver?
[07:42:48] <NoiseEee> ocx: no, images are fine, javascript is not
[07:43:11] <ocx> youtube videos are fine too? like images?
[07:43:27] <NoiseEee> how do you think you're viewing youtube videos on sites other than youtube?
[07:43:38] <ocx> does it require the CORS thing or not?
[07:43:42] <ocx> i know it works
[07:43:55] <NoiseEee> youtube isnt javascript
[07:44:01] <NoiseEee> so... cors is not involved
[07:45:26] <ocx> so now my jscript which is loaded on the local mobile using an application needs to call the website json api, do i have to allow all domains to call the website?
[07:45:37] <ocx> since i cannot know all the mobiles domains
[07:46:19] <ocx> so i have to use a wildcard on the server side right NoiseEee
[07:46:52] <NoiseEee> ocx: the wildcard goes on the server providing the data.
[07:47:04] <ocx> thats what i meant
[07:47:07] <ocx> on the webserver
[07:47:22] <ocx> means now anyone can pull data using xmlrpc
[07:47:37] <NoiseEee> follow http://enable-cors.org/server.html
[07:47:55] <NoiseEee> so yes
[07:49:05] <ocx> NoiseEee: what risks does it introduce to include a wildcard?
[07:49:25] <ocx> anyone will be able to execute my javascript code on his website right? so what
[07:49:37] <ocx> i dont get the risk
[07:51:19] <ocx> an example would be nice to illustrate the risk CORS solves
[07:53:52] <RabSimpson> hi folks, is it possible to take all options from a select and replace them with different options? i'm thinking i'd like to replace one chunk of html with another.
[07:55:19] <NoiseEee> ocx: that page i linked references an entire book on CORS and probably has some resources
[07:55:43] <NoiseEee> ocx: and it doesn't mean they can execute javascript on your server, it means *their* javascript can retrieve data from your server
[07:56:08] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: $('.someSelect').html('new options');
[07:57:10] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: that looks like it'll do the trick. should i $('.someSelect option').remove(); first? will that get rid of all that's currently there?
[07:57:51] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: It will, but just using .html('new html') will do that for you.
[07:57:59] <BillCriswell> In theory
[07:58:18] <RabSimpson> cool, i'll give it a go just now, thanks :)
[07:58:30] <NoiseEee> ideally you should $('selectReference').empty() afaik
[07:58:50] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Really? Hm
[07:58:56] <NoiseEee> will properly remove any handlers, etc
[07:59:01] <NoiseEee> not sure if html('') will do that
[07:59:12] <antoon> Hey lads
[07:59:13] <BillCriswell> Ah, ok.
[07:59:32] <NoiseEee> oh my bad html() does that too
[08:00:25] <ocx> NoiseEee: so mainly example, user1 access website1 index.html, now index.html contains some js that call website2 using xmlrpc to get some data, that is prohibited by default, a workaround for this would be for website2 admin to add website1 to the allowed domains?
[08:00:31] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: That's not something I'd even think about so glad someone did haha
[08:00:36] <RabSimpson> billcreswell: if i set var someVar = $( '.someSelect' ).html(); will that take a copy of all the original options?
[08:00:43] <ocx> or the user1 is identified by his own domain and not by website1 domain?
[08:00:46] <NoiseEee> RabSimpson: no, it would not.
[08:01:15] <RabSimpson> noiseeee: fair enough. can you point me at a function that would? :D
[08:01:16] <NoiseEee> ocx: sure, if you know specifically it will always be website1 and not *any* website
[08:01:19] <antoon> Is it a common issue, that a dragable element doesn't update parent() when dropped in a new container?
[08:01:34] <NoiseEee> ocx: you can certainly add that specific server to access-control-headers afaik
[08:02:03] <bengalo> what u mean with "update" there is no automagic happening when u make something draggable
[08:02:31] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: It would give you all the options as a string, if you have events or data or anything attached to them you'd lose them.
[08:02:31] <ocx> NoiseEee: but i mean in this example you would add the website 1 to the whitelist and not the user's domain to the whitelist
[08:02:33] <ocx> right?
[08:02:55] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: that's exactly what i'm looking for
[08:02:57] <antoon> well, if i drop my draggable <div> from a <td> into another droppable <td>, my div.parent() will still return the 'old' <td>, bengalo
[08:02:59] <NoiseEee> ocx: the domain of website1.  if the user was visiting example.org,  then the domain to add would be example.org
[08:03:11] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: this is pretty low level functionality
[08:03:46] <Olivius67> Hi there :)
[08:03:49] <bengalo> depends on when u call it i guess?!
[08:03:55] <ocx> NoiseEee: but a malicious user would be then able to create a fake request with the headers of website1 and send it to website 2 no?
[08:04:08] <bengalo> like if you call it manually afterwards, it will prob return the new td
[08:04:42] <bengalo> what function are u checking it in?
[08:05:02] <NoiseEee> ocx: i dont think thats possible, to spoof the ip
[08:05:15] <NoiseEee> ocx: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14505/can-i-trust-the-source-ip-of-an-http-request
[08:05:21] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: Sweeet.
[08:05:26] <RabSimpson> :)
[08:05:29] <Olivius67> I would like to change the background-color (rgba) of an element using jquery, but keep the alpha parameter. So basicaly only change rga not 'a'. Any simple way to do so?
[08:06:12] <Olivius67> rga* = rgb
[08:07:52] <runcar> caroline-bouet.fr : up arrow on top right work once, and then I have to click twice to get it working
[08:07:58] <runcar> can u please watch in js.js why dataslide doesn't work well. thx
[08:09:02] <Brodingo> runcar check the console; there was a problem loading something
[08:09:28] <runcar> it should't affect our stuff
[08:09:40] <runcar> this is a complete other thing
[08:09:40] <decx> Olivius67 what's stopping you from just not changing the alpha value in your .css() function?
[08:10:28] <antoon> bengalo: http://jsfiddle.net/8Lxnd/4/ move the red box to the box under, and click it
[08:12:05] <runcar> data slide value on up arrow is mistaken on the second click do you know why?
[08:12:16] <Olivius67> decx: prob is that my element bg-color is defined using background:rgba(..) in my css stylesheet (which for some reason I would preffer not to have to change), so when I do a .css('background', 'rgb(...)') i erase the alpha value
[08:13:32] <Olivius67> * when I do a .css('background-color', 'rgb(...)') i erase the alpha value
[08:13:50] <decx> of course you do, why not juse css('background-color','rgba')
[08:14:42] <antoon> I guess it makes sense bengalo, since I'm not changing the order of the doms, just where it "places" it
[08:16:58] <Olivius67> decx: sure but I'm only selecting and changing a plane color (no alpha) in my jquery script, the alpha param is defined by the stylesheet and must remain as is. Thus for now, have to first extract the 'a' component from the element background-color, to be able to set it back to the correct value when I change the plane color with my scrupt
[08:17:18] <Olivius67> script
[08:18:47] <bengalo> antoon if you need more help, tell us what exactly youre trying to accomplish, not what u think is not working. and possibly use a paste for your code to go along with
[08:21:06] <jop008> on an ipad the photos on this page look squeezed http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[08:21:24] <jop008> the pictures have size w 160 height 120
[08:21:48] <jop008> what is the good css for this the html is <td><img ...
[08:24:41] <MikeD_> if I have a button inside an LI, obviously inside UL, inside DIV... how do I reference the DIV from a click handler if 'this' is refering to the button?  is there a way to stop the .parents() traversal at the first ancestor DIV ?
[08:25:13] <BillCriswell> jop008: height: auto; on the image. You should ask questions like this in #css.
[08:25:28] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: $(this).closest('div')
[08:25:41] <MikeD_> sweet
[08:27:24] <ocx> NoiseEee: RESTful GET is also in a browser?
[08:27:46] <NoiseEee> ocx: not necessarily
[08:28:00] <runcar> can you please help with this on caroline-bouet.fr on top right there is arrows. down arrow is ok. up is not working well when I click it several times.
[08:28:23] <ocx> NoiseEee: so  can i use RESTful GET in a browser to bypass the cors thing
[08:28:28] <NoiseEee> :|
[08:28:35] <runcar> in the js.js I have some listeners for down et up
[08:28:36] <NoiseEee> ocx: i've already explained everything
[08:28:52] <NoiseEee> ocx: whats the difference between a "RESTful GET" and an http request?
[08:29:06] <runcar> to call a goToByScroll(dataslide) function
[08:29:12] <ocx> it is the same no?
[08:29:57] <NoiseEee> ocx: right
[08:30:12] <NoiseEee> ocx: so everything i just said about http requests, which is what your XHR/ajax is, applies
[08:30:17] <runcar> dataslide value seems to be wrong on up arrow when it is clicked 2 times
[08:30:35] <NoiseEee> you can't fake the IP, you can connect via anywhere, only javascript is limited by SOP / requires CORS to be implemented on the providing server

[08:36:51] <walidvb> after it runs: http://cl.ly/image/0O0R3h1f1X3E
[08:37:40] <jop008> I had that also auto
[08:37:44] <jop008> BillCriswell:
[08:38:44] <jop008> then the image is real small
[08:39:02] <jop008> chenged it to 100% also
[08:39:21] <jop008> set it like this width 160 and height 120

[08:39:57] <jop008> good tips are welcome
[08:42:32] <decx> Olivius67 i was in a meeting. here's a heads up to work with background-color in a function http://jsfiddle.net/decx/kLFdS/
[08:45:26] <Olivius67> decx: thx, that's more or less what I'm doing using regex to extract the alpha value, your solution is cleaner though ;-)
[08:46:26] <decx> it's a bit too reliant on a specific css so i would probably have to extend that to work with rgb, hex and text as well
[08:46:44] <decx> but it gives you an example on how to retain your alpha
[08:46:53] <Cork> decx: don't forget argb :)
[08:47:02] <Cork> (the ie syntax)
[08:47:09] <decx> yuk
[08:47:16] <Cork> #aarrggbb
[08:47:37] <Cork> best of all is it is #99FFFFFF
[08:47:41] <Cork> not all hex :D
[08:48:04] <decx> well edge cases can go right ahead an fuck themselves ^^
[08:48:23] <Cork> decx: the entire ie family is a margin for you??
[08:48:28] <Cork> *edge
[08:48:59] <decx> i'm a firm believer in graceful degradation, as long as it works it doesnt matter if one pixel is off or one gradient or alpha value isnt the same
[08:49:10] <Cork> sure
[08:49:24] <Cork> but as ie doesn't support rgba at all... your script kinda breaks
[08:49:58] <decx> ye that's why i'd have to extend it to at least fallback to rgb or hex
[08:50:20] <Cork> decx: hmm correction not all of the ie family
[08:50:23] <Cork> it is < ie8
[08:50:30] <Cork> sorry < ie9
[08:50:39] <Cork> so kinda acceptable i guess
[08:51:16] <fabioportieri> noooo my boss (commercial guy) wants me to do full time (9 hr) at the workplace, then travel to the main office (1 hr travel by car) and do some extra hours.. i want to die

[08:51:30] <Tingle> can someone give me a hand with this, http://jsfiddle.net/Fdq5p/2/ I want the event to happen if only the black area is clicked.
[08:51:57] <decx> event.target is your friend
[08:52:20] <Tingle> what do you mean
[08:52:48] <decx> console.log(event.target) to find out ;)
[08:53:18] <Tingle> console.log(event.target == $('aside')[0]);
[08:53:22] <Tingle> gotcha
[08:53:26] <Tingle> thanks
[08:53:34] <Cork> Tingle: http://jsfiddle.net/Fdq5p/3/
[08:54:08] <decx> you can $(event.target).is($('aside')) as well if you're not into the [0]
[08:54:11] <Cork> Tingle: you already have the element you want
[08:54:15] <Cork> no need to select it again
[08:54:19] <Tingle> ah thanks
[08:54:27] <Cork> decx: or just event.target === this;
[08:54:35] <decx> oh right in that context that would work
[08:54:38] <decx> derp
[08:54:39] <decx> :D
[08:55:29] <Cork> Tingle: also careful with stopPropagation, it tends to be scary if the code lives for long in the project
[08:55:43] <Tingle> rather use return?
[08:56:18] <Cork> no
[08:56:25] <Cork> return is even worse
[08:56:43] <Cork> Tingle: i mean you shouldn't stop the event from bubbling unless you can't do it without stopping it
[08:57:13] <Cork> Tingle: also as you bind it on body there is little point to it actually
[08:57:20] <Tingle> k
[08:57:29] <Cork> Tingle: oh, and another thing bind it to document instead of document.body
[08:57:36] <Cork> no need for the extra chars :)
[08:58:21] <vsgill> Anyone know a fun Jquery effect that could rotate through a bunch of images (gifs) in an array and then stops at one particular image?
[08:58:44] <vsgill> I'm just building something with friends for fun to see whose turn it is to do the work, etc
[09:00:42] <decx> that's no mere effect
[09:02:18] <airdem> did you mean "plugin" or "addond" ? :)
[09:02:21] <airdem> *addon
[09:02:44] <vsgill> Just fishing around and found this http://jsfiddle.net/jakecigar/aMmhZ/12/
[09:03:51] <Olivius67> Decx, cork: ie sucks indeed, however in my particular case, this rgba script is used for personal admin, thus if it works on ff and chrome the mission is completed ;-)
[09:03:58] <jop008> A table with an image must not be that complicated but no good way found yet to arrange it on an ipad http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[09:05:02] <jop008> Good on desktop but ugly on an ipad
[09:06:09] <fabioportieri> ugly how
[09:13:25] <zero_coder> hi
[09:14:49] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: are you still around?
[09:15:09] <zero_coder> RabSimpson: hi
[09:15:19] <zero_coder> i need some help with some js
[09:15:51] <airdem> we all do
[09:16:01] <airdem> just state the question :)
[09:16:34] * Velveeta slides open a little window in the door and says "state ya business!"
[09:20:21] <Velveeta> ok, i guess no help was actually needed..
[09:20:49] <ankurk_> Velveeta scared the fellow :P
[09:21:06] <Velveeta> i just had to make sure they knew the secret password
[09:22:23] <decx> it's hunter2 isn't it
[09:23:21] <RabSimpson> i'm having trouble with this fiddle, the option isn't being removed, any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/GUL2Z/1/
[09:24:04] <RabSimpson> loading jquery in the fiddle might've been a good idea!
[09:26:18] <RabSimpson> ok now i've hit another problem. when the conditions are met to load in the options again, i can't change the value in the select, it's stuck on whatever was selected="selected" when it loaded.
[09:26:21] <RabSimpson> http://jsfiddle.net/GUL2Z/3/
[09:28:12] <Cork> RabSimpson: ya, as the state is on the select element not the option
[09:28:47] <RabSimpson> cork: i don't understand, the state?
[09:29:15] <Cork> RabSimpson: or what do you mean stuck?
[09:29:51] <Velveeta> it would help if you gave us a quick one-liner of how this was *supposed* to work
[09:29:54] <RabSimpson> cork: the select stays on 'confirmed appointment' regardless of which option i click on
[09:29:59] <Velveeta> then we can see how it *actually* works and what's going on
[09:30:22] <Velveeta> when i click on an option, it changes properly
[09:30:46] <Cork> RabSimpson: you need to share str (Step To Reproduce)
[09:31:15] <RabSimpson> velveeta: onload i remove an option (after taking a string copy of all of the options for safe keeping). then once the 2 text fields are populated ( >0 and !='' ) properly the original options become available again.
[09:31:41] <RabSimpson> so when i first run it i give payment due date a value (anything)
[09:31:43] <Velveeta> do you just remove 1 option, or all of them?
[09:31:55] <RabSimpson> then i make offer price >0
[09:32:01] <RabSimpson> just 1 option
[09:32:10] <RabSimpson> the one with value 18
[09:32:10] <Cork> ah, i see it now
[09:32:19] <Velveeta> right
[09:32:35] <Velveeta> so you want to then set the select's value to the option with value 18 once those fields validate?
[09:32:36] <Cork> RabSimpson: jQuery('#status').html(options); will do that
[09:32:48] <Cork> RabSimpson: you constantly remove all options and recreate them
[09:32:59] <Cork> so the select element will lose the state
[09:33:01] <RabSimpson> i just want the all of the original options to become available again
[09:33:26] <RabSimpson> cork: it only removes and adds them on keyup and change of the 2 text fields
[09:33:27] <Cork> RabSimpson: but you do it on each change of the select
[09:33:37] <Velveeta> and keyup of the inputs
[09:33:44] <RabSimpson> cork: i don't see how it's doing that on changing the select
[09:33:47] <hellothere> how can i take an id $('#text').val() == and i want to check if its equal to any special characters (/^[a-zA-Z0-9._'\-\pL]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.'\-\pL]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/) any ideas?
[09:34:05] <RabSimpson> i haven't added a command to do anything .on change for the select
[09:34:20] <Cork> RabSimpson: jQuery(document).on('change', payment_due_date_field,
[09:34:22] <Velveeta> hellothere: you can try using the pattern attribute for form validation, depending on what browsers you need to support
[09:34:38] <Cork> oh, wrong element
[09:34:38] <RabSimpson> cork: i've specified the field with that though
[09:34:39] <jop008> A table with an image must not be that complicated but no good way found yet to arrange it on an ipad http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm. A table with an image must not be that complicated but no good way found yet to arrange it on an ipad http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[09:34:39] <Cork> hmm
[09:34:39] <Velveeta> otherwise, you're kind of answering your own question, you can just take the .val() and match it against that regex
[09:34:42] * Cork checks again
[09:35:10] <hellothere> i need to support pretty much everything and i tried the ng-pattern and it was producing a lot of errors
[09:35:17] <Velveeta> jop008: a) that's not really a jquery question, and b) you have to give us something more than "no good way found yet to arrange it on an ipad".. what's actually happening that's wrong?
[09:35:36] <hellothere> Velveeta: how can i define the regex though?
[09:35:41] <jop008> There is a fiddle also
[09:35:58] <Velveeta> hellothere: the shorthand is just: var regex = /my expression/;
[09:35:59] <jop008> but the problem iwth a fiddle is you don't see the actual layout
[09:36:17] <jop008> I tried to solve it with a fiddle
[09:36:25] <Velveeta> jop008: exactly, so that doesn't help us, unless we're viewing it on an ipad, which i would wager most of us aren't.. which is why we need details of what's actually happening on the ipad
[09:36:33] <jop008> jquery is al about css so it is a good channel
[09:36:35] <Cork> RabSimpson: just checked again, it is that event listener causing it
[09:36:51] <Cork> ah
[09:36:56] <Velveeta> jop008: jquery is all about css *selectors*, not necessarily css itself, try to keep your questions topic-relevant
[09:36:58] <jop008> You can see the code working on the site and the code on the fiddle
[09:37:16] <Cork> RabSimpson: the "selector" needs to be a string
[09:37:16] <jop008> Come on they are so close connected
[09:37:26] <RabSimpson> cork: is there any other way i can use .on change with that field? it won't be typed into as i have a js date picker so it's down to mouse clicks
[09:37:32] <Cork> RabSimpson: you give it a jquery object, and objects is taken as data not select
[09:37:36] <Velveeta> that's like saying "javascript and java are closely related because they share half a name"
[09:37:37] <Cork> *selector
[09:37:45] <Velveeta> css selectors and css rules don't have anything to do with another
[09:37:52] <RabSimpson> cork: i'm a little bit lost
[09:37:53] <Cork> RabSimpson: sure
[09:38:10] <Velveeta> jquery uses them as a means to get a handle to an element for javascript manipulation, not for presentational purposes unless they're explicitly using the css or add/removeClass functions
[09:38:32] <Cork> RabSimpson: http://jsfiddle.net/GUL2Z/4/
[09:38:34] <Velveeta> and that still doesn't help the fact that we're not viewing your demo on an ipad, so how can we help you figure out what's going wrong on the ipad unless you tell us what's going wrong
[09:38:58] <Cork> RabSimpson: just move the event listener to the elements you have in the array
[09:39:18] <Cork> RabSimpson: no point delegating if you give it specific elements
[09:39:30] <RabSimpson> cork: see this is how i thought it should work, then i read about people having problems using .on with 'change'
[09:39:56] <hellothere> Velveeta: i did do var regex = /[a-zA-Z \.\+\(\)\@\!\#\$\%\^\&\*\=\_\|\ ]/g;   and then if ($("#iptorg").val() == regex) { doesnt really work
[09:39:56] <hellothere> no console errors as well
[09:39:57] <Cork> RabSimpson: ya, many missunderstand what on is
[09:40:06] <Cork> RabSimpson: on is a combination function
[09:40:17] <RabSimpson> cork: thanks, i'll give it a blast on the live site just now :)
[09:40:31] <Cork> RabSimpson: it combines bind with delegate
[09:40:45] <Velveeta> hellothere: ahhhh gotcha, you should use this instead: if (regex.test($("#iptorg").val()))
[09:40:53] <Cork> RabSimpson: if the second argument is a string you get a delegated event handler
[09:41:02] <Cork> RabSimpson: in all other cases you get a bind handler
[09:41:14] <RabSimpson> cork: that all just flew right over my head :P
[09:41:15] <Cork> ?api delegate
[09:41:15] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:41:25] <Velveeta> hellothere: here's a pretty good page on regular expression support in javascript: http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascript.html
[09:41:45] <Cork> RabSimpson: delegate is if you want to match something that isn't in the page yet, or might get added later
[09:41:57] <RabSimpson> cork: ah i see
[09:42:00] <hellothere> ah let me try that Velveeta i was just looking at .test actually :D
[09:42:02] <Cork> RabSimpson: if you want to match specific elements, and not elements matching something
[09:42:04] <Cork> you can't use it
[09:42:14] <jesseatschool> also www.gethifi.com/tools/regex ^^
[09:42:18] <Velveeta> or if you just want to condense the number of listeners you have, like if you have a table of N cells, rather than attach N event listeners, you can attach 1 to the table
[09:42:44] <Cork> RabSimpson: well there is more uses for it, but it depends on you giving it a selector not elements
[09:43:07] <hellothere> Velveeta: that captures also the A-Z characters
[09:43:36] <Velveeta> hellothere: that's because you have them in your match clause
[09:43:43] <Velveeta> [a-zA-Z...]
[09:43:44] <RabSimpson> cork: i just tried the updated fiddle on the live site and it works as expected now, thanks again :)
[09:44:02] <hellothere> ok fixed it thx for that, sorry for being stupid
[09:44:06] <hellothere> thx for the help velveeta :)
[09:44:33] <Velveeta> hellothere: also, i'm not *positive* but i'm pretty sure that inside of square brackets, you don't need to escape things like . * + ? etc, only a literal closing square bracket
[09:44:44] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[09:45:03] <hellothere> what do u mean by that?
[09:45:22] <hellothere> i do need to escape everything tbh, because my code goes and creates an allias
[09:46:11] <Velveeta> what do you mean?
[09:46:54] <Velveeta> what i'm saying is that normally-special characters in regular expressions, which you would have to escape to make them interpret as literal characters instead, don't need to be escaped inside of square bracket selections typically
[09:47:24] <Velveeta> e.g. /this matches any next character. but this matches a literal period\. and this also matches a literal period[.]/
[09:47:34] <Velveeta> you don't need to do this: [\.]
[09:47:41] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure, anyway
[09:58:05] <jop008> is there a css channel?
[09:58:10] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:58:20] <jop008> #css?
[09:58:33] <duch_kazatel> did you try joining it?
[09:58:41] <jop008> yes
[09:58:53] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:59:09] <jop008> no one there
[09:59:14] <jop008> so ....
[09:59:18] <duch_kazatel> there are like 500+ people in there
[09:59:27] <duch_kazatel> 583 right now.
[09:59:31] <duch_kazatel> #css is the channel
[10:00:20] <jop008> I joined my irc client doesn't show the members
[10:00:30] <jop008> I only see a blank white page
[10:00:42] <duch_kazatel> i don't see you in there.
[10:00:53] <jop008> freenode
[10:01:00] <duch_kazatel> yes, you are on freenode right now.
[10:01:21] <duch_kazatel> what client are you using?
[10:01:31] <duch_kazatel> there you go - you're in there right now.
[10:07:00] <ocx> hi all, i have a local index.html on my computer i would like to include index2.html of my website in that index.html when index.html is opened on my local pc how can i do that?
[10:07:50] <SprkDev> I am using bootstrap to load another url, but I only want a certain div element from that url to be loaded. anyway I can do that?
[10:07:50] <duch_kazatel> use a server.
[10:07:51] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/sE2bN1k5
[10:08:15] <duch_kazatel> ocx you need to use a webserver of some kind and then either use SSI or a templating system.
[10:08:31] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev why are you asking in here instead of the bootstrap channel?
[10:08:43] <Cork> ocx: only option to do that client side would be with an iframe
[10:09:02] <Cork> ocx: for any other solution a server is needed
[10:09:07] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev if you're using jquery to do it, check out https://api.jquery.com/load/ -  	
[10:09:07] <duch_kazatel> $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" );
[10:09:31] <ocx> Cork: how can i do it with an iframe
[10:10:02] <Cork> ocx: <iframe src="address-to-index2.html></iframe>
[10:10:10] <duch_kazatel> ocx <iframe src="filepath/here"></iframe>
[10:10:16] <ocx> duch_kazatel: CORS required?
[10:10:23] <Cork> no
[10:10:31] <ocx> it is in a browser :/
[10:10:31] <duch_kazatel> ocx you're not using a server soooo...
[10:10:34] <Cork> you won't have any access to the content script wise
[10:10:36] <ocx> ok
[10:10:38] <decx> i havent heard the term Server Side Includes in over a decade
[10:10:43] <ocx> what does the iframe do exactly
[10:10:48] <duch_kazatel> it's an inline frame.
[10:11:07] <Cork> ocx: it creates a window inside the page and loads the other page in it
[10:11:13] <duch_kazatel> it loads up the document into a frame that's not at all dissimilar from the one the browser window
[10:11:24] <hellothere> anyone knows what the regex only for special character is?
[10:11:27] <duch_kazatel> *the one that is the browser viewport, actually.
[10:11:28] <ocx> can i have the whole page eaten by an iframe?
[10:11:32] <duch_kazatel> hellothere define "sepcial character"
[10:11:36] <duch_kazatel> ocx "eaten"?
[10:11:44] <SprkDev> I'm using load. But still it loads the entire page, and not a certain div of that page. But why? Here is my code.http://pastebin.com/nzVQL8Nw
[10:11:45] <ocx> lol
[10:11:46] <hellothere> $%.&"
[10:11:55] <ocx> i mean can i spread the iframe on the whole page
[10:12:00] <Cork> ocx: if you make the iframe that the full size of the normal page it will
[10:12:17] <Cork> but then you can't add any info from the first page
[10:12:18] <ocx> so that the user does not notice the existance of it
[10:12:29] <Cork> ocx: kinda ya
[10:12:40] <Cork> you will see the url in the urlbar
[10:14:12] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev look at my example again.
[10:14:13] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev you need to pass the URL, space, then the selector.
[10:14:13] <duch_kazatel> $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" );
[10:14:13] <duch_kazatel> ocx why are you doing that?
[10:14:13] <duch_kazatel> hellothere you want to capture anything that isn't alphanumermeric ?
[10:15:19] <ocx> Cork: http://pastie.org/8951110
[10:15:21] <ocx> not working :/
[10:15:39] <ocx> duch_kazatel: well i have a responsive site that i want to include in a webview to be used as app on android
[10:15:54] <Cork> ocx: missing end quote in the src
[10:16:06] <jop008> css forum they only tell me don't use tables at all
[10:16:55] <decx> it's easy, use tables for tabular data
[10:16:58] <hellothere> duch_kazatel: special characters as in (!.%$^&*)
[10:16:58] <hellothere> yes exactly
[10:16:58] <hellothere> but no whitespaces
[10:16:58] <hellothere> duch_kazatel: <: anything that isnt alphanumeric or whitespaces
[10:17:26] <ocx> thanks Cork
[10:17:30] <BillCriswell> jop008: Do you ONLY want the image at 160px?
[10:17:44] <jop008> and according to css people jquery is only a library
[10:18:04] <jop008> I want to resize it when the table had fewer columns
[10:18:10] <decx> what else do you think it is
[10:18:16] <drej> decx he's a little obtuse
[10:18:19] <jop008> Now the picture is real small on an ipad
[10:18:25] <drej> he coded his entire site with tables, then wants it to be responsive on an ipad
[10:18:28] <ocx> Cork: any limitations introduced with the iframe?
[10:18:33] <decx> yikes
[10:18:35] <jop008> and not because it is retina
[10:18:36] <jop008> also on old devices
[10:18:38] <SprkDev> but I am also using wordpress. what would test.html be in my case?
[10:18:47] <Cork> ocx: lots of them
[10:18:48] <drej> decx good luck :)
[10:19:02] <duch_kazatel> hellothere .match(/[\w]+/g) might be what you're looking for.  not sure though - that WILL include underscores btw.
[10:19:02] <duch_kazatel> hellothere no.  it won't include whitespace.
[10:19:07] <duch_kazatel> jop008 because tables aren't CSS....
[10:19:07] <duch_kazatel> jquery is only a library
[10:19:08] <ocx> Cork: like?
[10:19:08] <decx> i've been ignoring it successfully the last weeks drej :>
[10:19:10] <Cork> ocx: url changes from the page in the iframe isn't visible in the urlbar
[10:19:16] <drej> decx lol
[10:19:33] <Cork> ocx: event problems if you want to script with it from the host page
[10:19:35] <Cork> and so on
[10:19:48] <ocx> what if url changes are not seen any problems with that?
[10:19:57] <duch_kazatel> not's not anything more than that jop008
[10:19:57] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev huh?
[10:20:21] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev $('#results').load('/url/to/your/thing.html #andIDSelector')
[10:20:22] <duch_kazatel> jop008 you really need to go do some stuff on codeacademy.
[10:20:29] <Cork> ocx: if the user goes to a page and bookmarks it, they won't get a bookmark for the page they see
[10:20:53] <Cork> they will get a bookmark for your page with the original url you load
[10:20:53] <hellothere> duch_kazatel: it still includes the whitespaces T_T
[10:21:01] <drej> duch_kazatel i even linked him just the seybold "dont use tables" page from 2003
[10:21:03] <drej> he refused to read it
[10:21:15] <duch_kazatel> hellothere http://jsfiddle.net/fp8jC/
[10:21:15] <duch_kazatel> no, it doesn't.
[10:21:21] <ocx> Cork: also i believe you cannot make like xmlrpc calls and server side stuff from inside the iframe?
[10:21:26] <duch_kazatel> i think we need to ban jop008 at this point.
[10:21:41] <Cork> ocx: you can
[10:21:41] <duch_kazatel> because he's in here all the time asking other people to do his work for him.
[10:21:44] <jop008> No it is more than lib because it changes the complete dom using special tags
[10:21:51] <Cork> ocx: it is a fully separate page
[10:21:58] <jop008> so not only a lib also a design tool
[10:22:00] <duch_kazatel> jop008 WHAT?!
[10:22:04] <duch_kazatel> jop008 no, jquery does not do that.
[10:22:11] <drej> "jquery is a design tool"
[10:22:12] <ocx> its like i opened a new window but it is embedded in this case in the same page
[10:22:14] <Cork> ocx: the server can state that a page isn't allowed to be loaded inside an iframe
[10:22:17] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a library.
[10:22:17] <Cork> but that is about it
[10:22:25] <duch_kazatel> jop008 what "
[10:22:29] <duch_kazatel> what "special tags" are you talking about?
[10:22:32] <Cork> ocx: basically ya
[10:22:55] <ocx> i see so an iframe request is different than a normal http browser request right Cork?
[10:22:58] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/wowenelu/1/edit?html,css,output does this help?
[10:23:10] <Cork> ocx: not really
[10:23:15] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell wow, your tweet was right - you really must be bored if you're helping jop008
[10:23:15] <hellothere> duch_kazatel: i am sorry , i am currently using .test and not .match as match is any of those values but test is for 1 specific
[10:23:26] <ocx> how does the server know it is an iframe requesting the data?
[10:23:30] <Cork> ocx: a server can in its response state that the browser my not render it in an iframe
[10:23:34] <duch_kazatel> hellothere huh?  make a jsfiddle with that you want.
[10:23:39] <duch_kazatel> because you're not making any sense.
[10:23:55] <Cork> ocx: and if the browser supports those headers, or if the page checks for the iframe in js
[10:23:58] <Cork> it can prevent it
[10:24:08] <ocx> so the server is trusting the browser in this case
[10:24:21] <Cork> yes
[10:24:40] <ocx> Cork: always a pleasure chatting with you , thanks it is clear
[10:25:01] <drej> duch_kazatel i have a feeling he might be using jquery mobile
[10:25:03] <drej> or jquery ui
[10:25:12] <drej> but the fact that he cant even articulate that worries me
[10:25:15] <duch_kazatel> drej I really don't care - even then his statement is bullshit.
[10:25:21] <drej> i agree 100%
[10:25:22] <duch_kazatel> there are no "special tags"
[10:25:23] <jop008> Problem with a fiddle you can't see the full layout of the screen on a mobile device
[10:25:41] <duch_kazatel> jop008 please explain wtf these "special tags" are.
[10:25:56] <ocx> Cork: in the iframe can i load like sections of a page for example? some divs only
[10:26:19] <Cork> ocx: no
[10:26:29] <Cork> ocx: you have no control of what happens in the iframe
[10:26:45] <Cork> except that you can set new urls to load instead of what is inside it
[10:30:12] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/Su9gz/  how can i ADD to the var "patologiaregistada" without replacing the value before ? with var = var + x OR var += x ? in both cases i get [object HTMLTextAreaElement] when doing Text()
[10:30:24] <ocx> so mainly the google ads and these stuff are using iframes right
[10:30:28] <ocx> Cork:
[10:30:55] <Cork> ocx: yes ads often use iframes
[10:31:23] <ocx> you would use the iframe on your website but they control the clicks and stuff coz it is their actual page
[10:32:23] <Cork> ocx: kinda ya
[10:38:07] <JustAPoring> Hi guys. Does anyone know the difference of jQuery(htmlContent) vs jQuery("<div></div>").html(htmlContent).children() ? The former is causing rendering issues for me in IE8 while the latter seems to work the same as in other conventional browsers.
[10:38:44] <BillCriswell> JustAPoring: What is HTML content exactly?
[10:38:52] <BillCriswell> What is htmlContent exactly? *
[10:39:11] <JustAPoring> BillCriswell, it struggles with broken html
[10:39:30] <JustAPoring> for example, "<span></span></div>" would break in one but not the other
[10:39:38] <BillCriswell> JustAPoring: Right.
[10:39:59] <jop008> my fiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/nXyxS/72/
[10:40:33] <jop008> I tried the changes but no good fit on an ipad
[10:40:35] <duch_kazatel> jop008 you still haven't answered my question.
[10:40:36] <BillCriswell> You can't rely on broken HTML.
[10:41:49] <duch_kazatel> JustAPoring i know that jQuery("<div></div>") creates a document fragment.  not sure about the others.
[10:42:10] <JustAPoring> BillCriswell, sadly, I have to deal with it somehow - and it only happens in IE8 (or lower I suppose, but I don't care about those)
[10:42:41] <duch_kazatel> JustAPoring why are you having to "just deal wiuth it" re: broken HTML?  where's the markup coming from?
[10:43:30] <dave_s> First, are $(this).find('selector').html() and $(this, 'selector').html() the same?
[10:43:37] <dave_s> If so, which is more efficient?
[10:43:46] <duch_kazatel> dave_s yep.  the second maps to the first.
[10:43:51] <BillCriswell> The second calls the first.
[10:43:54] <BillCriswell> Damn, too fast.
[10:43:58] <BillCriswell> I want to retire.
[10:44:29] <duch_kazatel> the second might be marginally more performant becuase you're manually calling .find(), but that should be completely negligable.
[10:44:32] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell :)
[10:45:11] <jop008> to read here is not that easy
[10:45:19] <jop008> what is your question?
[10:45:26] <duch_kazatel> jop008 what "special tags" do you think jquery lets you use?
[10:45:33] <dave_s> Okay, because I was looking and it was making it sound like I was going to end up with a selection of both the `this` element as well as the `selector` element, but I'm just trying to get a child of an element.
[10:46:35] <duch_kazatel> dave_s you're convoluting $(this, 'selector') with $('selector, selector')
[10:46:45] <jop008> special tags <div with all kind of options
[10:46:58] <duch_kazatel> jop008 huh?  those aren't "Special tags"
[10:47:04] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: When you provide that example, the contrast is obvious. :)
[10:47:08] <jop008> data-role = and than some magical things happens
[10:47:08] <duch_kazatel> jop008 <div> is a tag.  it support attributes.
[10:47:11] <dave_s> That was rather helpful, thank you. :)
[10:47:13] <duch_kazatel> nothing special avout it.
[10:47:16] <duch_kazatel> dave_s of course :)
[10:47:26] <jop008> special because they manipulate the dom
[10:47:32] <jop008> I call that special
[10:47:43] <duch_kazatel> jop008 that's not special.  and it's still just a library.
[10:47:59] <duch_kazatel> jop008 head over to codeacademy and take classes on javascript, jquery, css, and html.
[10:48:42] <dave_s> Okay, so maybe you guys can help guide me down the right path. I'm working on v2.0 (basically) of my companies flagship product and am working on correcting all the inefficiencies and design flaws created by my lack of understanding of this industry with no mentor in house.
[10:48:57] <duch_kazatel> sounds fun.
[10:49:17] <JustAPoring> Here is an example of my problem. http://jsfiddle.net/zMHjW/2/ both examples yield the same result in all modern browsers, but the former is "null" in IE8
[10:49:39] <dave_s> I'm trying to build a very widget-y-esque dash-boardy type thing, and am currently working on jQ plugins that handle the widget-y-esque requirement.
[10:49:42] <duch_kazatel> JustAPoring don't deal with bad markup.  fix the bad markup first.
[10:49:55] <JustAPoring> duch_kazatel, I cannot. it comes from third parties.
[10:50:00] <dave_s> Does anything sane and flexible already exist I could use instead of a custom implementation?>
[10:50:02] <dave_s> *?
[10:50:06] <duch_kazatel> then tell them they're spitting out invalid markup or change providers.
[10:50:31] <duch_kazatel> dave_s i'd go read the jquery plugin tutorials.
[10:50:41] <duch_kazatel> the widget factory sounds like what you want.
[10:50:53] <duch_kazatel> it'll take boilerplate on your behalf, but you can get it going.
[10:50:54] <JustAPoring> duch_kazatel, not that it matters anyways. it's more of a "I'm interested in why this is like it is" than a "how do I fix this" question.
[10:50:56] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: I've already read the plugin stuff for jQuery.
[10:51:11] <jop008> I worked for 16 jyears with javscript
[10:51:25] <jop008> so I know my stuf
[10:51:30] <BillCriswell> 16 years?
[10:51:30] <NoiseEee> lol
[10:51:35] <NoiseEee> you spelled 'weeks' wrong
[10:51:40] <duch_kazatel> jop008 obviously you haven't.
[10:51:52] <dave_s> NoiseEee: What channel *aren't* you lurking in?
[10:51:58] <jop008> Wrong conclusion
[10:52:00] <dave_s> ;P
[10:52:05] <NoiseEee> jop008: everyone has been over and over this with you.  you ask the *same* questions about the *same* concepts repeatedly.
[10:52:16] <NoiseEee> jop008: im amazed people still respond to you.
[10:52:22] <duch_kazatel> jop008 i've spent WAY less time than that programming period and know this stuff FAR better than you do.
[10:52:27] <NoiseEee> you are *the definition* of a help vampire
[10:52:37] <NoiseEee> you *refuse* to learn / remember a solution and apply it elsewhere
[10:52:49] <NoiseEee> so complain to people who haven't put up with your bullshit for months
[10:53:38] <dave_s> jop008: Are you talking about $('div[data-custom="foo"]') or whatever?
[10:53:45] <duch_kazatel> dave_s don't help them.
[10:54:01] <duch_kazatel> and no, they mean <div data-thing="value"></div>
[10:54:05] <duch_kazatel> that is not a "custom tag"
[10:54:14] * dave_s points out i learned javascript and jQuery last january in <1month
[10:55:19] <duch_kazatel> dave_s :)  that's because you actually tried
[10:56:12] <dave_s> I'm no expert, and JS still makes me want to find an overpass now and again, but it can be fun sometimes too.
[10:58:05] <stlstude> I'm trying to create a button hover state by using .hover( function() and .addClass('hover'). I have that working, but it renders the button link useless. Is there a way to insert onclick='window.location='url'  ?
[10:58:24] <BillCriswell> I've been doing javascript poorly for like 6 years?
[10:58:31] <duch_kazatel> stlstude don't do that.  use .on('click', function(){});
[10:58:38] <BillCriswell> I'm ron burgandy?
[10:58:48] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell aahahahahahahaha
[10:59:47] <decx> i've been copying tutorials for 16 years, why aint i learnin bro
[10:59:56] <duch_kazatel> hahahahahaha
[10:59:59] <stlstude> duch_kazatel as a separate function, or incorporating that into the .hover function?
[11:00:10] <duch_kazatel> stlstude do it separately.
[11:00:19] <dave_s> stlstude: Just curious, why not style a Link like a button and use CSS3 for hover transforms?
[11:00:59] <dave_s> eg: Bootstrap 3  links <a class="btn btn-default">
[11:01:55] <stlstude> duch_kazatel sweet, thanks, good idea. and would definitely use CSS3 transforms but am having to use jquery.css() in this instance to apply styles to an existing button
[11:02:19] <decx> that's not exclusive fyi
[11:03:04] <decx> if you do css({ transition: '.5s ease-in'}) it even prepends the right prefix
[11:03:08] <wintermute_> hello,can this be done using jquery? transform a <td> to a textarea with the text included in <td>?
[11:03:46] <dave_s> wintermute_: Yes.
[11:03:48] <decx> you can't have a textarea in a tr, that's invalid
[11:03:51] <BillCriswell> wintermute_: I wouldn't replace the td completely.
[11:03:59] <dave_s> wintermute_: There are a few ways you could do this.
[11:04:01] <decx> but you can add a textarea in your td and feed it the text
[11:04:05] <BillCriswell> That just sounds like you're asking for trouble.
[11:04:13] <BillCriswell> I like the way decx thinks.
[11:04:30] <Thaifood> hi
[11:04:33] <wintermute_> how can i achieve this?which method of jquery?
[11:04:58] <dave_s> wintermute_: $('td').html('<textarea>' + $('td').html() + '</textarea>');
[11:05:07] <wintermute_> :O
[11:05:09] <wintermute_> is that easy
[11:05:15] <wintermute_> thanks man
[11:05:16] <decx> mytd.html(function(_,html){ return '<textarea>'+html+'</textarea>'}) to prevent double lookup
[11:05:19] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Eh, I'd be careful with that.
[11:05:24] <dave_s> wintermute_: You may want to use .text()
[11:05:30] <dave_s> If you have HTML in your TD
[11:05:35] <wintermute_> i will try both
[11:05:36] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Yours would get the first tds text for each one.
[11:05:46] <wintermute_> no it's plaintext/code
[11:05:53] <dave_s> BillCriswell: ?
[11:06:00] <wintermute_> i actually wanna click the td
[11:06:04] <wintermute_> and transform it
[11:06:10] <Thaifood> Is there a way to take a web page with a form and save it to a static html page after someone has filled it out and hit Submit ?
[11:06:19] <wintermute_> yes
[11:06:21] <BillCriswell> dave_s: $('td').html() would return the same thing each time I believe.
[11:06:25] <stlstude> duch_kazatel getting a "no method 'on' " error -- maybe due to jquery version or something?
[11:06:36] <dave_s> You mean the first td? I thought it was understood he should replace `td` and `textarea` with more appropriate selectors.
[11:06:52] <decx> you can actually just innerWrap('<textarea>') now that i think about it
[11:07:11] <wintermute_> i ll check everything out
[11:07:12] <stlstude> ah, used .bind instead with success
[11:07:30] <Thaifood> I'm trying to save it on the server btw
[11:07:34] <dave_s> stlstude: .on is preferred over .bind
[11:07:43] <decx> oh it's .wrapInner() wintermute_
[11:07:46] <BillCriswell> dave_s: http://jsbin.com/visafogo/1/edit this is what I Was saying.
[11:07:49] <decx> not innerwrap ^^
[11:08:20] <stlstude> dave_s yeah, but .on isn't included in older versions of jQuery, right? :-\
[11:08:27] <wintermute_> it's the same hehe
[11:08:37] <Tomashe> any jquerymobile channel?
[11:08:46] <dave_s> BillCriswell, wintermute_: [14:06] <dave_s> You mean the first td? I thought it was understood he should replace `td` and `textarea` with more appropriate selectors.
[11:08:47] <duch_kazatel> stlstude which version of jquery are you using?
[11:09:02] <duch_kazatel> stlstude maybe make a fiddle.
[11:09:17] <dave_s> Obviously selecting on just the element name is a bad idea. I just wanted it to be clear what was going where. :0
[11:09:24] <dave_s> * :)
[11:10:19] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Ahhh
[11:10:43] <Thaifood> I have a page with a form on it.  When the user fills out the form, i'm using wkhtmltopdf on the server to convert it to a pdf. So how do I save the filled out page on the server so I can send it to wkhtmltopdf ?
[11:10:58] <stlstude> duch_kazatel 1.4.3 -- it's an existing site im modifying, unfortunately, so i'm unable to update
[11:11:11] <dave_s> wintermute_: if you want to transform the TD on click, I'd bind on the doubleClick event and use `this`. This way to you don't have to worry about getting the right TD. (bind the double click event to the td tag, if you want the whole table affected)
[11:11:40] <dave_s> (double click will help prevent accidental text areas popping into existence.)
[11:12:38] <decx> fyi, contenteditable makes textareas superfluous in some use cases
[11:13:02] <dave_s> decx: Hmmm?
[11:13:25] <decx> you can write text anywhere with that attribute
[11:13:30] <dave_s> o_0 Blooody FREAKING hell!
[11:13:42] * dave_s hugs decx
[11:14:16] <duch_kazatel> stlstude try using .bind() then
[11:14:28] <dave_s> That's the most awesomest thing since ever.
[11:14:37] <stlstude> duch_kazatel yeah that's what i did and it worked
[11:14:47] <wintermute_> may i paste 3 lines?
[11:14:53] <decx> only fairly new browsers support it though
[11:15:35] <dave_s> decx: Our contract requires our customers to be using the latest version of FF or Chrome and IE 11.
[11:15:53] <duch_kazatel> stlstude cool
[11:15:58] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Must be nice.
[11:16:04] <decx> put it in a fiddle, anything beyond one line gets you deprecative looks in here wintermute_
[11:16:05] <stlstude> duch_kazatel thx for the assistance
[11:16:14] <duch_kazatel> stlstude of course.
[11:16:34] <decx> deprecative or deprecatory?
[11:16:42] <dave_s> BillCriswell: It is. I'm the sole developer here. I don't have time to cater to each browser's way of wanting to do it's own thing. We've standardized.
[11:16:51] <duch_kazatel> depreciative
[11:16:57] <dave_s> Not with my workload anyway.
[11:16:57] <duch_kazatel> but that's not the right sentiment
[11:17:10] <wintermute_> http://jsbin.com/visafogo/4/edit
[11:19:18] <decx> $('this') looks for a html tag named <this>, if you want to refer to itself you need $(this)
[11:19:34] <dave_s> wintermute_: this is an object. not a selector
[11:19:53] <wintermute_> i just don't know the syntax
[11:20:10] <wintermute_> just started using jquery
[11:20:33] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/visafogo/2/edit I never actually tried coding this out before, wonder how much I fucked it up.
[11:21:21] <dave_s> BillCriswell: I mean it works.
[11:21:32] <decx> y u no wrapInner
[11:21:44] <BillCriswell> decx: You know I miss very obvious shit at first.
[11:22:04] <decx> my first though was a html return function as well ^^
[11:22:13] <decx> thought
[11:23:23] <wintermute_> nice BillCriswell
[11:26:14] <duch_kazatel> welp this is pretty funny.  i know what jop008 has been working on this whole time.
[11:30:50] <BillCriswell> I think some Chipotle will cheer me up.
[11:31:02] <duch_kazatel> ooh. that sounds good.\
[11:31:26] <BillCriswell> Steak burrito with some guac.
[11:31:28] <dave_s> Searching jquery.com for "wrapInner" finds nothing, but Google knows exactly where to find it.
[11:31:36] <dave_s> I'm moderately disappointed.
[11:31:37] <duch_kazatel> api.jquery.com
[11:31:49] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/?s=wrapinner
[11:31:50] <dave_s> Still.
[11:31:58] <duch_kazatel> the main jquery site doesn't include the api docs.  kind of weird imo.
[11:32:37] <dave_s> That's one thing I love about PHP documentation. You have to try, hard IMO, to not find what you're looking for.
[11:33:21] <decx> at least one thing to love
[11:33:37] <dave_s> Hey now. I'm a PHP guy.
[11:34:10] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Can you accurately predict the argument order for a php function?
[11:34:21] <dave_s> Just because PHP has Wordpress doesn't make it horrible, just easier for horrible programmers to write horrible code.
[11:35:01] <dave_s> BillCriswell: Usually. But I learned PHP when I was 11.
[11:35:06] <decx> wordpress just looks bad until you've had to work with enterprise level cmses
[11:35:11] <dave_s> Probably not the best person to ask.
[11:35:19] <decx> then it's a shining beacon of grace and beauty
[11:35:32] <BillCriswell> dave_s: I've been using it a while, but I can never get the argument order correct.
[11:35:55] <BillCriswell> If I needed to use explode() I couldn't tell you which argument was which.
[11:36:25] <BillCriswell> It would make a fun game show.
[11:36:48] <dave_s> BillCriswell: I'll admit it can be inconsistent (especially with some of the string and array methods) but it doesn't make PHP inherintly bad or evil.
[11:37:02] <decx> the price is right format, 10/10 would watch
[11:37:25] <BillCriswell> dave_s: I agree, it still bothers me I've been doing it a while and have to look that up nearly every time.
[11:37:54] <BillCriswell> strtolower or str_to_lower? Etc.
[11:37:59] <dave_s> explode('delim', 'string') when you say that you would say "explode string by delim" so I can see your point.
[11:38:55] <dave_s> BillCriswell: Yeah, it's not horribly consistent.
[11:39:15] <decx> not like jquery is innocent there
[11:39:36] <dave_s> But when all you do all day is write PHP, you start to memorize this stuff.
[11:39:51] <decx> .on(event,el,fn), delegate(el,event,fn), $.data(el,data) el.data(data)
[11:39:53] <dave_s> decx: jQuery, while not consistent, is usually fairly flexible.
[11:39:56] <decx> that shit is confusing :>
[11:40:20] <BillCriswell> I think consistency is king. It's why people flock to Wikipedia in my eyes.
[11:40:23] <dave_s> decx: It makes the code prettier, but less readible most times.
[11:40:49] <BillCriswell> I also think it's why people went to facebook over myspace.
[11:41:11] <dave_s> BillCriswell: Yeah, I can understand the sentiment, but I'm not going to say I'll not use PHP because it's not perfectly consistent.
[11:41:20] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Absolutely.
[11:41:25] <decx> man i made so much money making custom myspace pages
[11:41:49] <dave_s> BillCriswell: Absolutely. That and you're never going to get glitter bombed visiting a facebook page or profile.
[11:42:09] <BillCriswell> decx: I blame custom myspace layouts for the fall of myspace lol.
[11:42:13] <BillCriswell> dave_s: Haha, truth.
[11:42:35] <decx> you are now, with wallposts for 50 games where you can help out your friends to get that 50 new crystals
[11:43:27] <dave_s> MySpace had many issues. Design problems reigned king here, but the fact that they in no way encouraged you to build a social network based on actual social networking theory and what have you.
[11:43:47] <dave_s> I give you "Friend/Whore Trains" as exhibit A.
[11:44:17] <Germanaz0> Hello, someone here used sizzle ? I would like to know if there is the possibility to use something like hasClass method
[11:44:39] <dave_s> decx: Facebook improved that, most apps actually have to pay to be seen. And you can block game requests.
[11:44:53] <decx> it's not as easy as that bill, i think the initial focus on students only helped create a class of 'early adopters' so when it finally went public all the cool kids where already there and pushed even more people to it. then it reached the breaking point to go into actual mainstream that no other social media site ever reached
[11:44:57] <dave_s> (in fact your better off paying to be seen)
[11:45:09] <BillCriswell> Germanaz0: You mean like .className?
[11:45:18] <Germanaz0> yes BillCriswell
[11:45:43] <Germanaz0> I have an element and need to check if match with the selector rule
[11:45:45] <BillCriswell> Germanaz0: You can just do like... .some-class a
[11:45:48] <lianzinho> guys, I have a javascript object which has it's own methods and properties… but I want to wrap it with query and use query methods to investigate it, what's the best way to do that?
[11:46:12] <bewilled> Need help with this function. 2% of the time, "clearInterval" does not work so loop goes on indefinitely. Code http://pastebin.com/Sf3dpjuc
[11:46:18] <dave_s> decx: I think it's described as herd theory or something to that effect? If all your friends are at Nightclub A you're not going to Nightclub B.
[11:46:47] <BillCriswell> Germanaz0: I think sizzle just selects things.. in jQuery you can test an element with a selector with $(this).is('.foo:not(.bar)')
[11:47:10] <Germanaz0> ok thanks BillCriswell
[11:47:21] <Germanaz0> Sizzle.matches( String selector, Array<DOMElement> elements )
[11:47:24] <Germanaz0> found :D
[11:47:29] <Germanaz0> you gave me the key word
[11:47:42] <BillCriswell> I did? Sweet.
[11:47:46] <Germanaz0> I did not know the "test" meaning
[11:47:58] <BillCriswell> Ok awesome. Glad I Could help.
[11:48:15] <Germanaz0> :D thanks
[11:48:25] <decx> so many global variables in there bewilled :o
[11:50:37] <rainabba> I need to select all nodes where at least one descendant with a given class does not have a 2nd class. Essentially $('.foo[*.bar:not(.hide)]') but I can't work out the syntax (if it can even be done this way). Suggestions?
[11:51:27] <BillCriswell> rainabba: .foo *.bar:not(.hide) I think is what you want.
[11:51:28] <rainabba> Ultimately I have a heirarchy of data where I show/hide the lowest level and I need to then show/hide all the parent containers based on whether any of the children are visible.
[11:51:56] <rainabba> BillCriswell: Won't that select the .bar elements though rather than the parents (.foo) ?
[11:52:18] <bewilled> decx: I added var to variables and it got even worse
[11:52:26] <erming> $(".foo").each(function() { /* Logic here */ });, instead of trying to rely 100% on selectors?
[11:52:27] <BillCriswell> If you want the foo you'd have to do like... $('.foo').has('.bar:not(.hide)')
[11:52:40] <rainabba> erming: That would work
[11:52:43] <decx> well you conveniently sidestepped all the scope issues with your globals bewilled ;)
[11:52:48] <rainabba> .has() !!!
[11:52:54] <rainabba> BillCriswelll: Nice, ty
[11:53:01] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:54:39] <decx> has is only for direct children is it?
[11:55:07] <BillCriswell> That seems like a weird limitation decx.
[11:55:45] <decx> seems logical to me
[11:56:07] <decx> depending on the arguments i come up with i can convince myself either way ^^
[11:56:31] <decx> damn my superiour argumentation skills :(
[11:56:48] <BillCriswell> decx: Are you saying that like <div class="foo"><div><div class="bar"></div></div></div> shouldn't work?
[11:57:05] <BillCriswell> but <div class="foo"><div class="bar"></div></div>  should?
[11:57:40] <decx> it's all descendants
[11:58:12] <decx> <ul><li><span></span></li></ul> $('ul').has('span') true
[11:58:51] <decx> probably slow with complex markup then
[11:59:04] <BillCriswell> You said direct children, I took that to mean that would fail but $('ul').has('li') would be true but $('ul').has('span') would be false.
[11:59:15] <decx> that's what i thought
[11:59:27] <decx> but it doesn't
[12:00:02] <BillCriswell> So just to clarify... I was right?
[12:00:12] <decx> haha
[12:00:13] <BillCriswell> RIGHT
[12:00:14] <rainabba> BillCriswell: :has() even :)
[12:00:14] <decx> yes
[12:00:22] <BillCriswell> I WIN
[12:00:32] <drej> speaking of win
[12:00:40] <drej> going to order my MINI on monday
[12:00:58] <BillCriswell> drej: I don't see the correlation.
[12:01:03] <decx> more like WINI am i right?
[12:01:11] <decx> up top o/
[12:01:15] <drej> \o
[12:01:32] <BillCriswell> Mini The Pooh would have been a good name for Pooh's sidekick.
[12:02:34] <lianzinho> are there any chain able way to test visibility like css('display') !== 'none'  ?
[12:02:46] <lianzinho> *chainable
[12:03:04] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: Like... you one want to do shit to shit you can't see?
[12:03:25] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: only to shit i CAN see
[12:03:47] <decx> :visible in the selector
[12:03:48] <BillCriswell> $('div').filter(':visible').addClass('visible')
[12:04:39] <aquaone> BillCriswell: could one use $('div:visible') ?
[12:04:42] <dave_s> Why is the jQueryUI documentation so horribly out of order?
[12:04:49] <lianzinho> :visible is query special stuff ?
[12:04:54] <decx> that's in the selector yes aquaone
[12:04:54] <BillCriswell> erming: That can work as well.
[12:05:52] <aquaone> ok, wasn't sure if that had changed. it's been a while since i've done much coding. i mostly idle here.
[12:05:53] <BillCriswell> lianzinho: Yes... if you want something less... pseudoghy you can do like $('div').filter(function(){ return this.style.display !== 'none'; });
[12:06:24] <BillCriswell> So many ways to do something probably stupidly.
[12:06:31] <BillCriswell> just how i like it.
[12:06:35] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: no, I guess it will do… I'll try some things here
[12:06:36] <lianzinho> thanks!
[12:07:03] <aquaone> so, random question. how does someone add a plugin to the jquery site?
[12:07:35] <dave_s> aquaone: http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[12:07:59] <aquaone> dave_s: cool, ty. i may submit yet another tablefilter plugin
[12:08:12] <dave_s> Hmmm?
[12:08:30] <dave_s> tableSorter is my reigning favorite.
[12:08:45] <aquaone> does tablesorter do filtering as well now?
[12:08:59] <aquaone> older code but only version i have online: http://c3p0.reverse.net/~aquaone/tablefilter/
[12:09:02] <dave_s> How do you mea?
[12:09:25] <dave_s> Oh.
[12:09:39] <dave_s> No, it doesn't. Not that I know of.
[12:09:58] <aquaone> i wrote my tablefilter very similar to tablesorter, even supporting integration.
[12:10:05] <dave_s> I use a "live search" anyway which is why I went for tableSorter anyway.
[12:10:11] <aquaone> ah
[12:10:21] <aquaone> mine is just for allowing filtering to static html tables.
[12:10:27] <dave_s> It's the only thing that did what I needed it to do without getting in the way.
[12:10:54] <dave_s> The other requirement was the ability to search the DB using multiple conditions with various comparisons.
[12:11:41] <bewilled> decx: why are the variables global if they are inside funcitons?
[12:11:49] <dave_s> name STARTS WITH foo AND code LIKE bar OR code IS bar1
[12:12:57] <becom33> I've been struggling with a navbar issue for like couple of hours now . http://s27.postimg.org/9wzb964kj/jquery_mobile.png if u can see in the image the texts has been shorten because of the width of screen . but what I want to do is . if the width is not enough . make it swipe left to right to see the other navbar list
[12:13:15] <becom33> not sure how to do that . if anyone could help that would be great
[12:14:01] <dave_s> becom33: Set Overflow to scroll, then hide the scroll bars?
[12:14:06] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I was wondering...if I have a bunch of elements that I want an event attached to, is it best to use something like '$('body').on('click', function() {});' as opposed to '$('.btn').click(function(){});' to use fewer event listeners?
[12:14:10] <jop008> and by the way I studied a long time jquery and other material so don't call me stupid :-)
[12:14:32] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: Both are the same thing...
[12:14:39] <systemfault> Err
[12:14:42] <Flam> DeltaHeavy: $('wrapping element').on('click', '.element', function() {
[12:14:47] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: You're missing an arg to .on
[12:14:55] <DeltaHeavy> Derp
[12:15:16] <dave_s> jop008: I don't think calling you stupid was the point. The point was these guys seem to support you regularly for the same things. They're not here to write your code. They're here to guide you to writting code well. It's up to you to take that and learn from it.
[12:15:18] <Flam> delegated events are better since its 1 event vs >1
[12:15:20] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: I though using the .click(), would add an event listener onto EVERY instance, where as the .on() would only make one.
[12:15:22] <DeltaHeavy> Am I wrong?
[12:15:29] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: Yes and no :P
[12:15:37] <v123> there's this jquery thats displaying fine in firefox, but not chrome.  http://vomark.com/product/philips-atl-hdi-5000-sono-ct/ - - - can anyone see why, easily?
[12:15:44] <decx> bewilled research the topic "scope" and all will become clearer. what are you even trying to do? looked like you want to move the background image on hover?
[12:15:50] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: .on has two syntaxes, the first one is the same as .click, the other uses event delegation
[12:15:57] <v123> the bottom menu is using jquery
[12:16:15] <DeltaHeavy> So do I want to use event delgation when I have a whole bunch of instances where the listening would be attached?
[12:16:16] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: So you want to use the second syntax $('body').on('click', selector, handler)
[12:16:21] <bewilled> decx: yep, a video thumbnail preview
[12:16:36] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: Yes, definitely.
[12:16:53] <dave_s> jop008: It seems as though you're not bothering to commit this stuff to memory for future use and are relying too heavily on the support community. They feel like they're wasting their time, I'm sure. I know I would if I spent hours and days answering the same questions for the same person repeatedly.
[12:17:02] <DeltaHeavy> Awesome, thanks systemfault and Flam!
[12:17:17] <duch_kazatel> we're still talking about jop008?
[12:17:45] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: [15:14] <jop008> and by the way I studied a long time jquery and other material so don't call me stupid
[12:17:51] <decx> bewilled i wouldnt use an interval, you can leverage better performance if you use css3 animations for something like this
[12:18:11] <duch_kazatel> Did I use the word "stupid"?
[12:18:28] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: I don't think so.
[12:18:48] <DeltaHeavy> Also, one other question I've been thinking about. If I'm using '$(this)', a lot, is it best to cache $(this) like: 'var x = $(this)' or just keep using '$(this)'. I guess most of the reason you cache is so querySelector() doesn't have to walk down the DOM which I assume isn't a problem when using 'this'?
[12:18:51] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: Besides, I think the better word is probably "Lazy".
[12:19:23] <decx> i can appreciate a good snark, but you don't have to bash the guy. have some class guys and be passive aggressive ^^
[12:19:59] <dave_s> decx: I wasn't trying to bash him. That reads a lot differently.
[12:20:08] <duch_kazatel> jop008 i never once called you stupid.  i gave you some constructive criticism.  you took offense.
[12:20:37] <jop008> only critics that is not what this forum is about
[12:20:58] <duch_kazatel> actually, this channel is entirely about helping each other become better developers.
[12:21:26] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: I think using $(this) is probably the same. I can't see what benefit you would have to caching since this is just the jquery object that you would be caching (If I understand this correcly)
[12:21:51] <DeltaHeavy> dave_s: Yep, thanks!
[12:22:04] <duch_kazatel> caching $(this) is smart in the event that scope can change in unexpected ways.
[12:22:43] <dave_s> jop008: In this field, like any other, you'll need to learn to both BE a good critic and RECEIVE good critic. Otherwise you're destined for mediocrity.
[12:23:04] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: It's faster to cache it in a variable... but the difference between caching it and not doing it is so small that it doesn't matter.
[12:23:16] <duch_kazatel> any time you call $(this) you're running a function call to create a new object - caching it once can save you a little overhead.
[12:23:19] <NoiseEee> jop008: also to learn based upon solutions being provided to you (repeatedly). also to respect those helping you by helping your goddamn self
[12:23:27] <jop008> I am a not a native speaker as well
[12:23:43] <bewilled> decx: too late, I gotta stick with this method, my I know why setInterval is not the way to go?
[12:23:59] <duch_kazatel> jop008 that should not matter one bit - you should be able to rcognize when you've all ready encountered the same problem before.
[12:25:22] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: I think the point here is, if you're worried about that <1ms (probably) of performance hit, cache it. Otherwise, business as usual unless you need to pass the current scope to an inner-method (like $.get() inside .click)
[12:26:09] <duch_kazatel> i always cache because i know that later on my code's scope will grow in unexpected ways - I have to account for requests a year from now to save me time in the long run.
[12:27:09] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: shouldn't the majority of your code be self-contained given the nature of jQuery basically being a massive series of call backs?
[12:27:39] <duch_kazatel> sure, but calling the jquery function is still a function call.  any time i can cut back on function calls is a good thing imo.
[12:29:24] <dave_s> I guess in a JS heavy application, that time can start to add up.
[12:29:47] <duch_kazatel> exactly.  in our case, we look to optimize where we can.  lots of small things add up in our case.
[12:31:10] <DeltaHeavy> dave_s: I'll just forget about it then. Thanks though.
[12:31:17] <dave_s> I can also see how performing multiple operations on a DIV could benefit from storing the jquery object returned from the first one.
[12:31:41] <duch_kazatel> yep
[12:31:45] <dave_s> Well, s/DIV/element
[12:32:24] <dave_s> Interesting food for thought.
[12:32:26] <DeltaHeavy> Sorry for all the questions but one more. I don't know why I havn't learned this before as I've been using jQ for like two years now, but how do I run a statement on both 'this', and '.class'?
[12:32:27] <DeltaHeavy> I'd usually just write the same statement out twice with different selectors.
[12:33:06] <duch_kazatel> what?
[12:33:18] <duch_kazatel> why would you need this and class?
[12:33:48] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: "He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever." --Chinese Proverb
[12:34:13] <DeltaHeavy> Because I want to add the class 'active' onto both the button clicked, and the menu it's going to slide down.
[12:34:19] <DeltaHeavy> @duch_kazatel
[12:34:30] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: $(this, '.selector').blah()
[12:34:41] <duch_kazatel> dave_s that won't work :)
[12:34:41] <decx> that can't be right
[12:34:54] <duch_kazatel> that's like rinning .find() on this.
[12:34:54] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: apparently its the same as calling $(this).find()
[12:35:09] <dave_s> Isn't that what he was asking?>
[12:35:18] <duch_kazatel> no
[12:35:21] <duch_kazatel> he wants to select two elements.
[12:35:22] <decx> actually that would be like $('.selector').find(this) dave_s
[12:35:23] <DeltaHeavy> dave_s: I want to select 'this', AND something else. Not find something inside of 'this'
[12:36:34] <decx> i guess $(this+', .class') doesnt work
[12:36:51] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: .add()?
[12:36:57] <duch_kazatel> why not run two selectors?
[12:37:09] <DeltaHeavy> dave_s: Looks like it, lemme try it out
[12:37:12] <duch_kazatel> you all ready have this - add a class there and run your other selector.
[12:37:33] <DeltaHeavy> Yay, it works. Thanks dave_s!
[12:40:06] <dave_s> DeltaHeavy: No problem. I thought you were looking for what I was looking for earlier, but it turns out you were looking for what I kept running across while looking for what I was looking for.
[12:40:10] <dave_s> It worked out.
[12:40:12] <decx> i think i never used add, thanks for the new info dave_s :>
[12:40:12] <dave_s> :P
[12:42:13] <dave_s> No problem decx. I stumbled across it while trying to figure out how to modify $(this) to get a child with a certain class because find() seemed too easy (meaning I thought there might be a better way)
[12:44:24] <decx> but what else do it do? i set up a perf http://jsperf.com/add-vs-in-selector
[12:48:31] <dave_s> decx: https://api.jquery.com/add/ The third example is interesting.
[12:48:41] <dave_s> But it looks like .add() is a bit slower.
[12:50:21] <decx> hmm looks like it could be useful when working with fragments anyway
[12:51:13] <systemfault> Well.. .add is two operations :P
[12:52:17] <dave_s> systemfault: Which 2? .find() and?
[12:52:32] <decx> but shouldn't $('a,b') be two operations as well?
[12:53:07] <systemfault> decx: Depends on the implementation... could be done in one shot using the selector API
[12:54:00] <decx> ah, sizzle magic
[12:54:13] <systemfault> http://jsperf.com/add-vs-in-selector/2
[12:54:32] <systemfault> Of course... QSA is a lot faster...
[12:54:39] <decx> oh that works with qsa as well
[12:54:43] <decx> nice
[12:59:11] <Ownix> is there a proper way to check if an element contains no other elements or text?
[12:59:29] <Ownix> like $(".class").is(empty)?
[12:59:38] <decx> close
[12:59:42] <decx> :empty
[13:00:01] <systemfault> I've been working with jQuery for the last 5 years... never had a single case where I needed to know that.
[13:00:07] <systemfault> What am I doing wrong?
[13:00:13] <Ownix> Thanks!
[13:00:17] <Ownix> systemfault: what line of work?
[13:00:31] <Ownix> I could explain my situation and it might make sense to you then lol
[13:00:31] <systemfault> Cutting trees with my ax? :(
[13:00:40] <decx> you're one of todays lucky 10000
[13:00:43] <systemfault> I'm a frontend dev... just like you :P
[13:00:50] <Ownix> systemfault: im front and back
[13:01:19] <Ownix> Database dev, ASP.NET C# dev, front end CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, bootstrap, Datatables, knockout.js
[13:01:25] <systemfault> I'm backend too if the idea is to show who has the biggest epenis ;)
[13:01:33] <Ownix> Mines HUGE
[13:01:45] <systemfault> I'm more of a Java/Node.js/PHP backend dev..
[13:02:00] <Ownix> I dont know a thing about that
[13:02:03] <systemfault> C# is uber sexy but I stay away from the whole MS stack.
[13:02:11] <systemfault> So.. I don't use it :/
[13:02:14] <Ownix> Yeah im balls deep in it, definitely pros and cons
[13:02:31] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[13:02:35] <Ownix> I really like intellisense though
[13:02:52] <Bloomberg> Some idea for formatting numeric values with jquery?
[13:02:58] <Bloomberg> 2.900,78
[13:03:14] <systemfault> Ownix: Yeah... I'm missing it when I use PHP or Node... Java is fine for that.
[13:03:52] <Ownix> systemfault: you do anything with JSP?
[13:04:12] <Ownix> Bloomberg: https://code.google.com/p/jquery-formatcurrency/
[13:04:16] <systemfault> Ownix: Not really, I did a bit of Freemarker... but most of the time, I work on web services.
[13:04:18] <v0id3d> How would i count how many <li>'s are in a <ul>? or what route would i have to go to find such a thing
[13:04:29] <systemfault> Ownix: Mostly REST-like HTTP endpoints.
[13:04:37] <NoiseEee> v0id3d: how would you select all the <li>s in a <ul>?
[13:04:56] <v0id3d> ty ill go read on that
[13:04:59] <v0id3d> -=)
[13:05:00] <Ownix> systemfault: id really like to get into WCF and do that, the whole RESTful thing. I need it for the resume, and my company wants to do mobile apps so id like to have them all use the same API for consistency
[13:06:32] <jop008> there is no way to run a fiddle full screen?
[13:07:24] <decx> add /show/ to the url
[13:09:35] <jop008> Looking @ this fiddle everything looks fine http://jsfiddle.net/kkppd/49/ or am I wrong
[13:10:20] <jop008> the actual code on the ipad has smaal pictures which can be seen here http://www.happyaway.nl/list-entry.htm
[13:10:38] <duch_kazatel> what am I looking for?
[13:11:46] <duch_kazatel> "smalll pictures"?
[13:20:53] <dave_s> jop008: Was ist der Problem?
[13:21:40] <dave_s> Diese Photos seht gut...
[13:22:37] <dave_s> Ich verstehe nicht deiner frage. Hast du eine frage?
[13:22:42] <baconisgood> Hello.
[13:25:08] <decx> you're trying to talk german to a dutch person, but good job. it's "das Problem" and "ich verstehe deine Frage nicht"
[13:25:45] <dave_s> decx: I haven't had German since high school. And his site looked excessively German. :P
[13:26:10] <dave_s> Buuut not that I actually look, it's not German. :(
[13:26:22] <decx> if there are many oek, euks and ijfs it's dutch :D
[13:26:26] <sfaw> Hello, I have a problem using https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest
[13:26:35] <dave_s> *Now
[13:26:57] <sfaw> I have a demo page where it works fine, but now I try to include it into an existing script where $ is not used but jQuery instead ...
[13:27:09] <dave_s> decx: Problem is neuter?
[13:27:12] <dave_s> Huh.
[13:27:25] <dave_s> I thought it was masculine.
[13:27:54] <`ULT> ---
[13:27:56] <`ULT> Hello, this is not a realy jquery question but does someone has an idea?
[13:28:11] <dave_s> `ULT: I have many ideas.
[13:28:15] <`ULT> moment :p
[13:28:35] <`ULT> on my site are three files. 1: product.tpl. Im loading a javascript file on this file called 2: validation-jquery.js. On this javascript file i need to load the third file: process.php
[13:28:47] <`ULT> the paths from the files are:
[13:28:47] <`ULT> [21:22:12] <@`ULT> 1 product.tpl: root\catalog\view\theme\shoppica\template\product\product.tpl
[13:28:47] <`ULT> [21:23:19] <@`ULT> 2 validation-jquery.js: root\catalog\view\javascript\jquery\validation-jquery.js
[13:28:47] <`ULT> [21:24:34] <@`ULT> 3 process.php: root\catalog\model\catalog\process.php
[13:28:47] <`ULT> [21:25:15] <@`ULT> How can i load file 3 (process.php) in file 2 (validation-jquery.js)
[13:28:48] <`ULT> [21:27:51] <@`ULT> I suppose: ../../../../../model/catalog/process.php OR ../../../model/catalog/process.php but both paths are not working
[13:29:08] <dave_s> `ULT: Don't paste more than 1 line at a time.
[13:29:16] <dave_s> Now I have to resize my IRC window.
[13:29:18] <`ULT> sorry i will post it again
[13:29:23] <`ULT> ------------
[13:29:30] <`ULT> on my site are three files. 1: product.tpl. Im loading a javascript file on this file called 2: validation-jquery.js. On this javascript file i need to load the third file: process.php
[13:29:33] <`ULT> the paths from the files are:
[13:29:37] <`ULT> 1 product.tpl: root\catalog\view\theme\shoppica\template\product\product.tpl
[13:29:41] <`ULT> 2 validation-jquery.js: root\catalog\view\javascript\jquery\validation-jquery.js
[13:29:46] <`ULT> 3 process.php: root\catalog\model\catalog\process.php
[13:29:46] <dave_s> `ULT: Pastebins are usually used for pasting multiple lines of 'stuff'
[13:29:58] <`ULT> How can i load file 3 (process.php) in file 2 (validation-jquery.js)
[13:30:03] <`ULT>  I suppose: ../../../../../model/catalog/process.php OR ../../../model/catalog/process.php but both paths are not working
[13:30:06] <`ULT> you can read it now?
[13:30:14] <`ULT> i can make a screenshot
[13:30:33] <decx> there's no relation between the place of the tpl and your assets
[13:30:36] <dave_s> Good luck pasting that. ;P
[13:30:41] <decx> it depends where you're calling it from
[13:31:16] <`ULT> uhm, im calling it from the validation-jquery.js file
[13:31:23] <decx> as a easy way out you can always use /path to go to path from the root of the domain regardless of where you are
[13:32:19] <decx> so if your validation-jquery.js is in root\catalog\view\javascript\jquery\ you can have a script src ="/catalog/view/javascript/jquery/js-val.js"
[13:32:21] <`ULT> aah oke, so you suggest an absolute path with /path/catalog/...
[13:33:16] <`ULT> oke, but my question is to call process.php in js-val.js
[13:33:37] <dave_s> I don't even understand this question. To me it sounds like you're trying to include a PHP file in a javascript file which, with the standard server config, just is not possible,.
[13:33:59] <dave_s> Unless you're calling process.php with an AJAX request.
[13:33:59] <decx> same thing $.ajax('/catalog/model/catalog/process.php'....
[13:34:02] <dave_s> Or something.
[13:34:05] <`ULT> it is a ajax request yes
[13:34:31] <`ULT> i will give it a try
[13:34:33] <dave_s> Okay, if process.php is in your Web root, just call it from JS like you would in the browser.
[13:34:39] <dave_s> The URI will not change.
[13:35:09] <`ULT> true, thanks
[13:35:38] <dave_s> But you can't <?php require_once('process.php') ?> from inside your JS file.
[13:35:41] <`ULT> but do you know why the relative path isnt wokring?
[13:36:08] <dave_s> `ULT: Use a path that is relative to your web root.
[13:36:33] <decx> you don't have to traverse your filestructure with ../s like you would have to in php
[13:36:42] <`ULT> aah oke, right!
[13:36:58] <`ULT> that make sense :p
[13:37:02] <dave_s> `ULT: The only major benefit to this that I can think of straight off is moving with ease between domains and from localhost without Virtual Directory aliasing to production.
[13:38:52] <Shackleford> I am trying to access an API with $.ajax, but not sure what I am doing wrong, I keep getting XMLHttpRequest cannot load errors
[13:38:54] <Shackleford> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e7e2a26d4bedc23bb1e5
[13:39:10] <Shackleford> ^^ is my function, can anyone see what I am doing wrong
[13:40:01] <kev999> Hi regulars - which atom you splitting today ??
[13:40:12] <Shackleford> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
[13:40:15] <Shackleford> is the exact error
[13:41:00] <dave_s> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20035101/no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource-w
[13:41:02] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: its because you're using javascript/ajax to call the aPI directly
[13:41:27] <Shackleford> ok, is that the wrong way, what is the best practice... noob w/ API's
[13:41:31] <kev999> anyone know why this statement won't work (maybe too ambitious) : $('.form_group:has(input:contains("Add another"))').hide();
[13:41:58] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: your backend goes to the API, retrieves data, sends it back to JS
[13:42:06] <dave_s> Shackleford: Well, unless you're making this request over HTTPS, and each user of your application has their own API credentials, this is a VERY VERY bad way to do this.
[13:42:12] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: instead of ajaxin' to the API, you ajax to your backend which makes a request to the API
[13:42:34] <dave_s> You're effectively exposing your API credentials to anyone who uses your application.
[13:42:55] <`ULT> its working now, thx dave_s and decx
[13:43:14] <dave_s> `ULT: NP
[13:43:17] <Shackleford> I see
[13:43:24] <kev999> missed the beggining of this - would shackleford be advise to use curl on the backend ?
[13:43:34] <NoiseEee> kev999: it doesn't really matter the method.
[13:43:42] <NoiseEee> kev999: whatever's easiest really
[13:43:43] <Shackleford> but if the requirement is "All calls should be authenticated with HTTP Basic Authentication"
[13:43:52] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: your backend can provide that
[13:43:56] <`ULT> some times it s realy easy :p i`m trying to learn some jquery and php
[13:43:58] <Shackleford> ohhh ok
[13:44:01] <dave_s> kev999: I usually use stream_context_create with file_get_contents because cURL can be nightmarish to deal with.
[13:44:07] <Shackleford> I thought that meant everything through the client side
[13:44:38] <Shackleford> so let me get this straight, the backend will make the call, then ajax to the front end
[13:44:52] <dave_s> Shackleford: Yes.
[13:45:29] <Shackleford> ok, and that is for security.... so what about .getJSON what is the difference with that and .ajax?
[13:45:40] <dave_s> Shackleford: And you don't need an Authorization: BASIC header communicating with *your* backend if the users are logged in already as the cookie/session will be sent.
[13:46:16] <kev999> JSON is a way of passing data (array style) to the front end
[13:46:27] <Shackleford> got it
[13:46:34] <kev999> ajax usuall just outputs flat text formatted by you
[13:46:43] <dave_s> Shackleford: .getJSON retrieves data from your backend and parses the JSON into a JS object.
[13:47:03] <Shackleford> ohh ok ... simple, yet so profound!
[13:47:08] <dave_s> If you set a Content-type header on your backend to "text/json" jquery will detect this and do it for you.
[13:47:13] <dave_s> So you can just use .get
[13:47:29] <dave_s> Or pass the parameter to get/ajax that tells it you expect to receive JSON.
[13:47:38] <dave_s> Or HTML or XML or whatever.
[13:47:47] <dave_s> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[13:48:01] <dave_s> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[13:48:10] <dave_s> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[13:48:15] <kev999> anyone available to tell my why $('.form_group:has(input:contains("Add another"))').hide(); doesn't work ???
[13:48:16] <dave_s> They're all different ways of doing the same thing.
[13:48:47] <Shackleford> ok, so If I am setting a test site on my local, I could use php, py, ruby, whatever to access the info (via curl?) and then does that info need to be stored in a db or can it be passed to the front end directly
[13:49:29] <Shackleford> because the info I am accessing is in JSON already
[13:49:36] <dave_s> Shackleford: It only has to be stored in a DB if you want to persist the data to disk.
[13:49:46] <Shackleford> got it
[13:50:22] <dave_s> Shackleford: You'll either have to call $.parseJSON, or use the $.getJSON  or $.ajax/get with the dataType set to JSON to be able to use the JSON in the front end.
[13:50:26] <decx> kev999 i guess contains just looks inside the element and doesnt check its value
[13:50:33] <dave_s> Unless you set a content-type header in the backend.
[13:50:37] <decx> and as input doesn't have an inside..
[13:51:10] <dave_s> Shackleford: jQuery won't parse anything into JSON that isn't already JSON. JSON = JavaScript Object Notation.
[13:51:17] <kev999> doh -> knew it would be simple - thanks decx - should be using val()
[13:51:21] <dave_s> It's a way of representing JS Object as a string.
[13:51:30] <Shackleford> makes sense, got it
[13:51:44] <dave_s> But even if your app echos JSON back to your front-end, if you don'
[13:52:03] <dave_s> t conver the JSON, or set a content-type header, you're still going to have a string.
[13:53:00] <dave_s> I like the content-type header because it keeps me from having to do anything special or extra to work with the response. jQuery is smart enough to know from the header what to do with the response.
[13:53:56] <Shackleford> ok, dave_s, right now, I have a url, username & pw.  I want to call the url and then have the user input the user name & pw in http basic authentication.  Whne authenticated, the JSON will get passed to me.  How exactly would I do that method of authentication with jQuery?
[13:54:28] <kev999> decx / anyone interested - my command should have been $('.form_group:has(input[value*="Add another"])').hide();
[13:54:45] <decx> selector hell :>
[13:55:15] <dave_s> Shackleford: What are you trying to do?
[13:55:42] <dave_s> And why does the user need to enter a password for HTTP Basic Auth?
[13:56:46] <dave_s> Say I want to do something with Google Maps. I have my own google maps key. My users don't need their own key, I share it with them.
[13:57:00] <dave_s> So when the user logs in, I setup their cookie/session/etc.
[13:57:46] <dave_s> Now they want a map or something. I send a request to MY backend. MY backend queries GOOGLE servers with MY API key and returns this to the front end, after performing any other necessary operations on the response.
[13:58:10] <Shackleford> this is a front end exercise
[13:58:21] <Shackleford> I am provided the url username, and pw
[13:58:29] <dave_s> My users don't need to authenticate a SECOND time to use MY API. Each request to the API sends cookies and makes session data available.
[13:59:00] <Shackleford> I understand, I am completely new to API's
[13:59:30] <Shackleford> and I was asked to use basic HTTP Auth, to get the JSON and input into a view
[13:59:34] <dave_s> If you need to access the remote API using the USER credentials for that API (say StackOverflow API) you can store the user's credentials in your DB, and use those when your server queries the SO API.
[14:00:08] <Shackleford> I have the view, all set, but I need to get the JSON from the API
[14:00:29] <Shackleford> when I log in to the URL, I can see the JSON (on the server)
[14:00:37] <Shackleford> but having trouble getting to the front end
[14:00:40] <Shackleford> if that makes sense
[14:01:21] <dave_s> If the username and password are different for each user, you can provide them with a text box or something to enter that data.
[14:01:31] <Shackleford> I understand what you are saying, but I am simply trying to get the JSON with basic username & pw HTTP auth.... more as an exercise and not a real world app
[14:01:38] <dave_s> Otherwise persist it in your code or in your DB or wherever you like and have the front end query the backend.
[14:02:18] <dave_s> Shackleford: Is this an assignment for school or something? If so, maybe it would help if you showed us the question or whatever.\
[14:02:41] <Shackleford> not really for school, but I am just trying to learn how to use an API
[14:03:04] <Shackleford> ok one sec
[14:03:23] <dave_s> Well, then there you have it. Store your user's API credentials if they differ by user. Let your Front End query your backend which should query the API.
[14:05:16] <kev999> Shackleford - what server side code are you using?
[14:05:27] <dave_s> This is pretty much the defacto way of dealing with this and doing it in a way that is secure (assuming HTTPS and all the other fun stuff).
[14:06:08] <Shackleford> dave_s https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19b0d55ebdec1931b3ec
[14:06:18] <Shackleford> kev999, py
[14:06:29] <Shackleford> but I am solely dealing with the frontend
[14:06:38] <Shackleford> the API is provided to me
[14:07:04] <kev999> py - whish I could help bye ... :-)
[14:07:18] <Shackleford> lol, no prob
[14:08:40] <Shackleford> dave_s, I have the front end mapping stuff rendering, just need to get the data so I can iterate through and populate
[14:09:30] <dave_s> Nothing in there says this has to be 100% front-end implementation.
[14:11:11] <Shackleford> true, I just assumed... since i only really know front end, I was trying to do it that way, since it didn't say anything backend
[14:11:21] <Shackleford> but I completely understand what you are saying
[14:11:35] <Shackleford> more than anything, I want to learn how to work with APIs
[14:12:38] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: well truthfully, unless the API providers have set up their servers to allow access from anywhere/any origin, the backend is usually involved.
[14:13:00] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: often for security, API key hiding as well
[14:13:13] <Shackleford> "All calls should be authenticated with HTTP Basic Authentication" this doesn't mean Front end only?
[14:13:19] <NoiseEee> your backend can send all the required authentication headers
[14:13:21] <Shackleford> good point NoiseEee
[14:13:28] <Shackleford> ahh ok
[14:13:32] <NoiseEee> http requests can be made from just about anything
[14:14:44] <Shackleford> NoiseEee, do you have an example of what this would look like (backend code?)  I am still a little lost on how to authenticate and pass the JSON
[14:15:25] <NoiseEee> Shackleford: I'd google "api call example backend authentication <yourLanguage>"
[14:15:36] <Shackleford> perfect, thanks
[14:15:43] <NoiseEee> or similar :)
[14:15:52] <Shackleford> half the times, its just knowing what to search for
[14:15:59] <Shackleford> proper voacbulary
[14:17:00] <dave_s> Shackleford: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9651528#file-gistfile1-txt
[14:17:19] <dave_s> That's a really crappy RestClient I wrote WAAAAAAAAAAY back in the day.
[14:17:23] <dave_s> Don't use it.
[14:17:36] <dave_s> But, it's how you might do this with PHP.
[14:17:44] <Shackleford> oh ok, that really helps
[14:17:51] <Shackleford> I will go through it
[14:17:56] <Shackleford> and write my own
[14:18:24] <Shackleford> thanks again man, for walking through this with me
[14:18:28] <Shackleford> it is really appreciated
[14:19:35] <silvio-> im trying to create a plugin if i want it to work on only 1 element like $('#id').myplugin({options}); how do i apply my methods to it, is the proper way to do something like this.each() then apply everythign iw ant in a loop
[14:20:15] <silvio-> basically would it be like this: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#using-the-each-method
[14:20:54] <dave_s> silvio-: If you only want it to work on one method, only use a selector that creates a collection of 1 element.
[14:21:25] <dave_s> You could just not use the this.each(function(){}); but if you pass the plugin a collection of elements, there's no gurantee you're getting the one you want.
[14:21:41] <dave_s> *work on 1 element
[14:22:14] <silvio-> so even when working with one i probably should still put it in a each statement?
[14:22:43] <dave_s> I mean if you **KNOW** you'll NEVER EVER EVER pass it a collection, don't worry about the each().
[14:23:00] <dave_s> Otherwise, it might be smart to use the each() method.
[14:23:10] <kev999> what about adding an additional check of .length
[14:23:39] <kev999> to check only 1 element in the collection
[14:23:45] <dave_s> kev999: But how do you know inside the plugin you're working on the element you really want to work on?
[14:24:44] <kev999> it's just a double check - like you say make the selector specific so that it selects one element - just thinking double check
[14:24:46] <dave_s> Or I guess you could set an error or return this when there is more than 1 and juse do nothing.
[14:24:59] <kev999> exactly
[14:25:00] <silvio-> how do you set internal properties inside the plugin? do you just decalre them in the "(function ( $ ) {" set of code
[14:25:11] <silvio-> or is there some other way to do it
[14:25:25] <dave_s> silvio-: The jQuery API docs do a really (suprisingly) good job of explaining this.
[14:25:26] <silvio-> does anyone have an example of what a small plugin with properties would look like
[14:25:29] <kev999> over to you dave - options
[14:25:32] <dave_s> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[14:26:14] <dave_s> silvio-: Have a look at "Accepting Options" ;)
[14:26:25] <dave_s> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#accepting-options
[14:26:32] <dave_s> oooh, permalink. XD
[14:27:00] <decx> here's my basic starting point silvio-
[14:27:10] <decx> maybe should have pasted the link ^^
[14:27:12] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/eP4dV/8/
[14:28:01] <dave_s> decx: While that works, it's not a durable starting point.
[14:28:19] <duch_kazatel> what's going on here?
[14:28:20] <silvio-> that makes sense
[14:28:37] <silvio-> maybe im confused on how to handle state
[14:28:50] <decx> dave_s please go on, always looking to polish things up
[14:29:04] <dave_s> decx: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#protecting-the-alias-and-adding-scope
[14:29:18] <silvio-> dave_s thats what im doing
[14:29:42] <silvio-> using the protecting the alias and inside that adding my function, but if i want ot handle a state like when you click a button something opens up
[14:29:48] <decx> oh yes i'm adding the wrapper before using it :>
[14:29:52] <dave_s> silvio-: That was for decx. His example didn't include the closure that ensures a local alias for $.
[14:30:11] <silvio-> would you track that in a variable or in a class
[14:30:18] <dave_s> silvio-: Do you mean events?
[14:30:20] <duch_kazatel> silvio- javascript doesn't have classes.
[14:30:29] <duch_kazatel> silvio- are you trying to track some kind of state about an element?
[14:30:59] <silvio-> i mean in a element class
[14:31:11] <silvio-> add a class to the element "opened"
[14:31:16] <duch_kazatel> because there are three semi-sane ways to do that: through data- attributes, some kind of big ugly object, or tracking classes.
[14:31:26] <duch_kazatel> the classes are good if you're doing stuff with CSS, but if not, I might avoid it.
[14:31:39] <duch_kazatel> really depends on what you're doing though.
[14:31:50] <dave_s> silvio-: You  can trigger and even on the element like this $('#selector').trigger('opened');
[14:32:04] <dave_s> *event
[14:32:05] <duch_kazatel> dave_s he's asking how you would then track if it's opened or closed.
[14:32:15] <kev999> does silvio need .data('state','open')
[14:32:25] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: jqueryUI widgets maintain their state.
[14:32:44] <dave_s> Not sure if jquery plugins do as well, they're basically built on the same stuff.
[14:32:44] <duch_kazatel> dave_s right - he's asking how he should do it.
[14:32:57] <duch_kazatel> i provided three separate ways for him to approach that.
[14:33:24] <silvio-> .data might make the most sense
[14:34:09] <dave_s> silvio-: I think he meant data attributes like <a href="#" data-target="some_id">click</a>
[14:34:21] <silvio-> i think there is a .data function in jquery isnt there?
[14:34:24] <duch_kazatel> dave_s .data() reads and (sort of) writes those.
[14:34:38] <kev999> nope I meant .data()
[14:34:38] <silvio-> aw that makes sense
[14:34:39] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: Are you kidding me? That's totally kick ass,.
[14:34:41] <Thav> In my rails app I'm using $(document).ajaxSend to send a CSRF token.  We upgraded to jquery 1.11 and that function is no longer firing.  I don't know where to start looking for the problem, any suggestions?
[14:34:58] <duch_kazatel> dave_s yes.  jquery converts data- attributes to be readable via .data()
[14:35:37] <kev999> sorry - didn't realise that - I'll but out now :-)
[14:35:40] <decx> beware, when you write with data it doesn't add a data-attribute to your element, just a prop that's bound to that element
[14:35:49] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: There should really be a "Welcome to jQuery" handbook that goes out to everyone when they first start. It should have a section "Useful methods you'll never hear about but wish you had"
[14:35:53] <duch_kazatel> decx is correct -.
[14:36:14] <duch_kazatel> dave_s it exists: https://learn.jquery.com
[14:36:18] <duch_kazatel> also, the API docs.
[14:36:28] <decx> can be a source of confusion, but also pleasure as you can use a sort of scopeless variable
[14:36:29] <duch_kazatel> Thav what function isn't firing?
[14:36:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah, binding data like that is neat.  just be careful with how crazy you get with it.,
[14:37:00] <Thav> duch_kazatel: ajaxSend
[14:37:03] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: Yeah, but I don't know that there are many people who have actually sat and read the entire jQ API site and the learn site.
[14:37:16] <duch_kazatel> dave_s it comes with experience.
[14:37:26] <duch_kazatel> dave_s also, the source code can be helpful.
[14:37:53] <duch_kazatel> it's one of the ways you find out stuffl like $('#div1', '#div2') actually calls .find()
[14:37:58] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: I know, I know. Just, it would have been super awesom to know about the .data() method ages ago. It's not something you would ever think to go looking for.
[14:38:18] <dave_s> More like a method you might consider writing in the global scope to save you time. :S
[14:38:30] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[14:38:40] <Shackleford> dave_s so I reread the entire requirement and found the piece that made me think to do it all on the front end https://gist.github.com/anonymous/97913b02dbadedacbd05
[14:38:54] <dave_s> Then you find out: "Hey, that's in jQ core" and you're like "Aww F***"
[14:39:10] <Shackleford> Am I reading that correctly?
[14:39:11] <duch_kazatel> dave_s hah, i haven't had that feeling in a looong time.
[14:39:46] <baconisgood> hi, im trying to use data I sent to the browser through jquery append, but I'm trying to use that html to display a rotator, problem being the rotator can't see the html :S
[14:40:01] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ BaconOverflow
[14:40:01] <b-ot> BaconOverflow: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:40:02] <checkit> Hey guys... I've been toying around w/ this jquery validate remote: feature for too long for it to still not be working the way I need it to. It's time for me to call on a professional in here... Here is my validate rule which works. The remote call to my script returns true or false depending on whether or not the URL already exists in my DB... You'll see in this screen cap I'm getting this strange error message. Script: ht
[14:40:02] <checkit> tps://gist.github.com/anonymous/9651950. Screencap: http://imgur.com/0vVbo7l.
[14:40:04] <duch_kazatel> err, baconisgood
[14:40:22] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood, paste some code for us to look at.
[14:41:54] <kev999> baconisgood are you waiting for (document).ready before calling
[14:42:42] <dave_s> Shackleford: I don't think this is something you would generally do with pure JS.
[14:42:57] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford what's the API you're using?
[14:43:08] <baconisgood> kev999: yes. the append is happening in the document.ready function, and then I'm calling the rotator plugin.
[14:43:13] <dave_s> Shackleford: In PHP, you can set a header requesting Basic Auth credentials.
[14:43:20] <kev999> baconisgood you might also have to use .delegate or promise in the rotator function
[14:43:28] <Shackleford> I understand, but am I wrong to assume that based on the requirements, I am really trying to understand, as it was described to me as a front end exercise
[14:43:40] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford  JSONP is a pretty standard thing.
[14:44:02] <duch_kazatel> jsonp is a pretty common technique to work around CORS issues - ajax makes the world go 'round
[14:44:13] <Shackleford> such it is a practice server that a friend of mine had set up
[14:44:15] <stlstude_> Is it true that you can use .append() to add multi-line strings of HTML? I'm attempting to do that and escaping each line with \ but no dice
[14:44:50] <duch_kazatel> a lot of API service providers don't want to make you store a copy of their data on your own server.
[14:45:21] <duch_kazatel> so they use various cross-domain setups to do it.  JSONP is nifty because you don't have to deal with CORS.
[14:45:39] <Shackleford> I understand, but this being a front end exercise, is it doable in all js?
[14:45:42] <kev999> stlstude_ just build the html - no need to worry about line continuations
[14:45:48] <dave_s> stlstude_: The .append() argument can't have in-code line breaks or you're likely to get a parse error.
[14:46:18] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford yep
[14:46:21] <dave_s> if you get multi-line HTML from an API or something, this works.
[14:46:35] <Shackleford> ok
[14:46:37] <stlstude_> kev999 and dave_s so I can do multi-line strings without any sort of unique formatting
[14:46:42] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford in fact, JSONP is explicitly FOR js.  in-broser even.
[14:46:50] <Shackleford> Ahhh
[14:46:51] <Shackleford> ok
[14:47:15] <kev999> think shackleford is having a moment :-)
[14:47:23] <dave_s> stlstude_: Show us what you're trying to do please.
[14:47:25] <Shackleford> to say the least
[14:47:33] <duch_kazatel> ajax is all about letting your javascript process the request, instead of needing to do a whole weird setup.
[14:47:48] <duch_kazatel> AJAX is short for "Asynchronous JavaScript And XML"
[14:47:54] <duch_kazatel> the XML part is often replaces with JSON these days.
[14:47:59] <kev999> it was the enlightenment of ahhh oh OK
[14:48:00] <duch_kazatel> but the point still stands.
[14:48:47] <Shackleford> I know this may be easy stuff to guys, but that just wrinkled my brain
[14:48:52] <Shackleford> good stuff
[14:48:52] <Tomashe> Hey guys what could cause this : $(this).parent().find("[href='#wall']").click(); . not to work. if it does find the element . and by not work i mean url isnt chaning
[14:48:57] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford you'll learn.
[14:49:03] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: But the requirements are to use the browser Authorization Basic dialog. How do you trigger that in JS when it (AFAIK) is determined by a header, and the headers can't be modified from JS since the JS has to be written to the browser first.
[14:49:09] <Shackleford> thats the goal
[14:49:30] <duch_kazatel> dave_s because you're initiating a basic GET request, just like any other.
[14:49:31] <checkit> Can anyone tell me why my implementation of validate is generating this error message? http://imgur.com/0vVbo7l Script: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9651950
[14:49:53] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe are you getting any errors?
[14:50:14] <Tomashe> no error
[14:50:35] <Tomashe> just ignoring me
[14:50:39] <kev999> shackleford - no idea who the guys are behind this irc, but I have learnt more here than anywhere else on any subject - it's a great platform and the guys are expert
[14:50:53] <stlstude_> dave_s here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lstude/7KuG4/
[14:51:05] <duch_kazatel> then maybe the browser doesn't like what you're doing - console.log() everything up to the click and see what it is.
[14:51:28] <kev999> Tomashe past your code - might not be a parent etc
[14:51:43] <duch_kazatel> kev999 tomashe's example is almost always this site he's been working on.
[14:51:47] <Shackleford> kev999, totally agree... I'm always cautious to ask something completely "stupid"  I heard irc is good at berating people, but I have learnt a lot
[14:51:48] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: So you're saying if I submit a $.get() request to an endpoint requiring Authorization Basic, the browser will display the dialog and pass the credentials with an updated request?
[14:51:54] <duch_kazatel> and it's always almost impossible to help him.
[14:52:03] <duch_kazatel> dave_s if I remember correctly, yes.
[14:52:09] <duch_kazatel> but i could be way off base there.
[14:52:29] <Tomashe> kev999: what that have to do with parenting ... it does find the element
[14:52:31] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford it's better to seem a fool for 5 minutes, than to be a fool for a lifetime.
[14:52:39] <Tomashe> my code is inside a function
[14:52:57] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe what does clicking that link actually do?
[14:53:33] <dave_s> stlstude_: http://jsfiddle.net/7KuG4/1/ It's fine as long as you include the $
[14:54:17] <kev999> gotta go now - fun while it lasted .........
[14:54:19] <stlstude_> dave_s OH MY %$^#$%...can you tell i've been looking at this too long? I was like...srsly what am I missing here
[14:54:40] <dave_s> stlstude_: If you're writing a JS string and your IDE breaks to another line, that's legal, If you press Enter your browser is sending you to hell.
[14:54:53] <dave_s> Which is what I thought you meant.
[14:55:45] <dave_s> stlstude_: Ah, No problem. We've all done it. It's like masturbating.
[14:55:50] <stlstude_> dave_s yeah, actually that was my initial problem, hence the \. but then was just missing the dadgum $. fml.
[14:56:07] <stlstude_> thanks for the more detailed eye, dave_s :)
[14:56:15] <dave_s> Honestly IDK why you weren't getting an error in your console.
[14:56:28] <dave_s> Your browser should have at least grumbled a bit.
[14:56:31] <duch_kazatel> without the $?
[14:56:38] <duch_kazatel> because it was evaluating the expression.
[14:56:38] <dave_s> I should think.
[14:56:46] <dave_s> Ah.
[14:56:52] <duch_kazatel> the .append() might have thrown an error.
[14:57:00] <duch_kazatel> but maybe not.
[14:57:00] <dave_s> But an expression doesn't have methods attached,,,
[14:57:38] <duch_kazatel> something tells me the browser doesn't even get that far because the parse says "yep that's a string" and then gives up?  let me poke.
[14:57:54] <duch_kazatel> wait that yells at me.
[14:58:05] <dave_s> stlstude_: Do you have firebug?
[14:58:14] <duch_kazatel> TypeError: "#shopping-cart-totals-table tfoot".append is not a function
[14:58:20] <stlstude_> dave_s i use chrome dev tools
[14:58:22] <duch_kazatel> also: firebug + acebug is an amazing combo.
[14:58:39] <duch_kazatel> chrome's tools show an error on that too, stlstude_
[14:58:57] <dave_s> TypeError: "#shopping-cart-totals-table tfoot".append is not a function
[14:59:30] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: acebug? hmmmm
[14:59:32] <duch_kazatel> ah, yep.  it evaluates the string, and strings don't have an .append() method.
[14:59:32] <duch_kazatel> weee
[14:59:32] * dave_s googles
[14:59:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah, it makes the javascript editing panel less shitty
[14:59:57] <stlstude_> duch_kazatel and dave_s -- seems to be working for me ?
[15:00:13] <dave_s> Without the $?
[15:00:15] <duch_kazatel> stlstude_ you have the console open and you then click "run" on the fiddle, right?
[15:00:33] <stlstude_> duch_kazatel oh you're referring to the fiddle
[15:00:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[15:00:43] * dave_s adds Acebug to FF
[15:01:08] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:01:17] <dave_s> Thanks for the tim
[15:01:20] <dave_s> *tip
[15:02:36] <dave_s> stlstude_: Yeah, we're wondering why your browser didn't show you your mistake and save you the hair pulling.
[15:03:20] <stlstude_> dave_s the interwebs hate me today. le sigh.
[15:03:25] <dave_s> I've always thought union browsers sucked. :P
[15:03:32] <checkit> No one can solve this one? Really?  Why my implementation of validate is generating this error message? http://imgur.com/0vVbo7l Script: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9651950
[15:04:44] <Tomashe> duch: it should put the #wall in the url like u actually click on the <a href..
[15:04:57] <Tomashe> $(this).parent().find("[href='#wall']").click(); < as u can see
[15:06:30] <dave_s> checkit: I've never used the validate plugin.
[15:07:25] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: im putting the footer on live event. but i guess that isnt matter if it actually find the elemet
[15:08:39] <duch_kazatel> back
[15:09:15] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe uh, why not just set the window.location.hash?
[15:10:43] <baconisgood> this isnt a working or full example but its bascially what im trying to do http://jsfiddle.net/HnKqe/
[15:11:06] <dave_s> checkit: Is this going to the backend to validat the route?
[15:11:17] <dave_s> If so, have you checked the response your backend is returning?
[15:11:20] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood that's not how .get() works
[15:11:22] <frank_o> Hey guys. I no longer have to use iScroll with the iScrollView wrapper for scrolling in jQuery Mobile right? http://barrow.io/overflow-scrolling and https://github.com/filamentgroup/Overthrow should suffice?
[15:11:31] <dave_s> Other than that, I have no idea.
[15:11:36] <checkit> dave_s: The script is going to the server to check that the requested item doesn't already exists. So, yes.
[15:11:55] <baconisgood> duch_kazatel: it grabbed the file I wanted and it through out the output?
[15:12:01] <checkit> The right data is being returned.
[15:12:11] <baconisgood> duch_kazatel: therotator just wouldnt see it
[15:12:11] <dave_s> checkit: Are you returning a direct boolean result returned by the test method without inverting it?
[15:12:26] <checkit> dave_s: Yes
[15:12:27] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood that's not how .get() works, so it makes the example look confusinmg
[15:12:37] <baconisgood> duch_kazatel: oh.
[15:12:39] <dave_s> Try inverting the boolean with an !.
[15:13:05] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood so what are you trying to do here?
[15:13:16] <Tomashe> duch i will try
[15:13:31] <dave_s> for instance if return urlExists('url') return value to the JS, the JS is going to do the opposite of what I want unless I return !urlExists(...)
[15:13:36] <baconisgood> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to get the rotator plugin to see the HTML that gets grabbed from the XML and succeesfully appended.
[15:13:57] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood oh, that's easy.  you need to put your other code in a success callback.
[15:14:13] <duch_kazatel> otherwise the browser ships off the request and then moves on.
[15:14:17] <Tomashe> duc so how do i change : window.location.hash to what i want
[15:14:19] <checkit> dave_s: This is my server side php: return Response::json(Routes::where('link', trim(strip_tags(Input::get('route'))))->count() > 0 ? true:false);
[15:14:38] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood you need to wait for stuff to return.  use the .done() callback.
[15:15:02] <dave_s> checkit: This is the only thing I can think of is it's getting the wrong response somehow, like a logic bug.
[15:15:20] <duch_kazatel> checkit i'd look at your return and go from there.
[15:15:27] <dave_s> checkit: As I said, I've not used this plugin so beyond that, I can't really posit anything else.
[15:16:26] <checkit> Right, thanks guys. Just to be clear, I did start at the server side and this image shows an example response. Do anything here jump out at you? http://imgur.com/0vVbo7l
[15:16:55] <duch_kazatel> checkit and you tried the negation?
[15:17:04] <baconisgood> duch_kazatel: im new to jquery how do I start to do that with what I have.
[15:17:11] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Negation?
[15:17:32] <duch_kazatel> checkit you're returning "false" - the validate plugin might be saying "that means it's bad".
[15:17:47] <duch_kazatel> so return true instead.
[15:17:49] <duch_kazatel> see if that works.
[15:17:55] <checkit> Gotcha. I'll try the inverse.
[15:17:56] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood start with the docs.

[15:18:59] <baconisgood> lol
[15:19:14] <checkit> Dammit. Good call duch_kazatel. That must've been up. For some reason the logic just wasn't matching up for me. Thanks again bud. And to you dave_s.
[15:19:35] <baconisgood> thanks thats very clear.
[15:19:44] <duch_kazatel> checkit you were returning "false" to the validator - it was saying "is this valid?" and you said "false" :)
[15:20:16] <duch_kazatel> baconisgood http://jsfiddle.net/HnKqe/1/ it'll be something like this.
[15:20:24] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Right. I've come to that realization now. From the server side perspective it didn't feel right. Client side however, I can see how that is clearly the correct logic.
[15:20:44] <duch_kazatel> cool.  i wind up with stuff all the time.
[15:20:52] <duch_kazatel> *that kind of stuff all the time.
[15:20:53] <dave_s> checkit: [18:13] <dave_s> for instance if return urlExists('url') return value to the JS, the JS is going to do the opposite of what I wantunless I return !urlExists(...)

[15:38:30] <Tomashe> duch: your way actually working but only 1 time , after 1 time its now working any more
[15:39:05] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/9NjER/
[15:39:07] <Tomashe> thats my code
[15:40:20] <dave_s> Tomashe: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9652944
[15:41:32] <Tomashe> ?
[15:41:36] <Tomashe> hows that helps
[15:42:03] <Tomashe> and whats wrong with my way
[15:42:11] <dave_s> Nevermind, I thought you were looking for pretty much what you already have.
[15:43:08] <Tomashe> ok
[15:43:13] <Tomashe> so thats not working :/
[15:44:22] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe woah wtf.
[15:44:33] <duch_kazatel> your first two lines are WAY bad.
[15:45:18] <Tomashe> ohh ?
[15:45:29] <Tomashe> so what do u offer?
[15:45:41] <duch_kazatel> don't bind within a bind.
[15:45:45] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[15:46:05] <duch_kazatel> wait.
[15:46:07] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/9NjER/
[15:46:11] <duch_kazatel> oh, i get it now.
[15:46:12] <Tomashe> this is my code
[15:46:23] <duch_kazatel> linebreaks made it hard to read what was going on.
[15:46:37] <Tomashe> sorry. so what are u offering ?
[15:47:00] <duch_kazatel> are you removing/replacing .footer-c at any point?
[15:47:07] <Tomashe> yes
[15:47:15] <Tomashe> everytime a page loads
[15:47:35] <duch_kazatel> ... then you're losing your binding.
[15:47:36] <Tomashe> there is 10 pages , every slide the entire html change
[15:47:40] <Tomashe> ohh
[15:47:48] <Tomashe> ok so how do i rebind again
[15:47:51] <dave_s> Tomashe: .remove removes bindings as well.
[15:47:54] <duch_kazatel> no, don't do that.
[15:47:58] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea.
[15:48:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/9NjER/1/
[15:48:24] <duch_kazatel> where #container is a container that persists
[15:48:57] <Tomashe> ok ohh u mean like BODY
[15:49:13] <duch_kazatel> don't bind to body if you can avoid.
[15:49:24] <duch_kazatel> find a container that you never removing and go from there
[15:49:40] <Tomashe> only body
[15:49:43] <Tomashe> why body is bad?
[15:50:04] <duch_kazatel> because you'll have to filter every click that happens.
[15:50:17] <Tomashe> ohh
[15:50:18] <duch_kazatel> if you're replacing all the contents of body, you're doing something very strange.
[15:50:26] <Tomashe> its mobile app
[15:50:30] <Tomashe> phonegap
[15:50:53] <duch_kazatel> that still doesn't make sense, but ok.
[15:51:01] <duch_kazatel> either way, bind to body if you have to.
[15:51:01] <Tomashe> why not ?
[15:51:01] <dave_s> Tomashe: Can't you wrap sections of your page in unstyled divs and replace those contents instead>
[15:51:13] <duch_kazatel> only replace the specific things you need to replace.
[15:51:14] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:51:37] <Tomashe> but as the page slide a new page comes with sometimes footer / header same
[15:51:47] <Tomashe> if i leave them stand the slide wont look good
[15:51:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:51:59] <dave_s> ^
[15:52:04] <duch_kazatel> you're making your frontend do too much work.
[15:52:05] <Tomashe> heeheh
[15:52:12] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:52:24] <duch_kazatel> leave your header/footer alone and in place
[15:52:36] <duch_kazatel> and let the rest do your stuff.
[15:52:46] <Tomashe> rest?
[15:52:50] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet you've got some kind of tabbed interface going on?
[15:52:53] <dave_s> The header and footer should be fairly static, IMO
[15:52:58] <duch_kazatel> the stuff between the nav and footer.
[15:53:46] <Tomashe> but i want them to slide
[15:54:01] <duch_kazatel> are they statically positioned on the page?
[15:54:06] <Tomashe> no
[15:54:09] <Tomashe> i mean yes on each page
[15:54:12] <Tomashe> but each page slides
[15:54:20] <duch_kazatel> ... don't slide your header/footer then.
[15:54:23] <dave_s> Tomashe: why not just have the content area slide?
[15:54:39] <duch_kazatel> go look at how the twitter app does it.
[15:55:17] <Tomashe> ok
[15:55:37] <duch_kazatel> also, don't do hash == MapUrl
[15:55:39] <duch_kazatel> use ===
[15:55:46] <dave_s> If this is mobile, the header is likely only .25" tall, if that, and the footer shouldn't be much larget than that either I would imagine. Why have them slide as well? I don't know that I've ever seen UI/UX where the header and footer slid with the app's slides.
[15:56:45] <FlightOfGrey> Hey, I am looking for some help getting toggle to work, this is what I have at the moment: http://jsfiddle.net/4kMuD/188/ but I have an issue that you can't click on the link inside of the info div, what happens instead is it toggles the div to close again... How would I make it so only clicking on the title toggles the child div to be shown/hidden?
[15:57:03] <Tomashe> they are not sliding
[15:57:11] <Tomashe> the div wraping everything is sliding
[15:57:21] <duch_kazatel> FlightOfGrey why are you using such an old version of jquery?
[15:57:28] <dave_s> Tomashe: If you *really* want the header and footer to slide, then use an animation or something, just don't destroy the elements or you'll also destroy your Bindings.
[15:57:49] <Tomashe> how bad is to have like 100 $("body").on("click"... on a js ?
[15:57:59] <FlightOfGrey> I hadn't realised it was on that setting..
[15:58:01] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe really bad
[15:58:18] <Tomashe> ok
[15:58:32] <duch_kazatel> FlightOfGrey also: the $.fn.toggle() you're using was deprecated in recent versions (and finally fully removed in 1.9)
[15:58:57] <FlightOfGrey> Ohhh, has anything replaced it? Or hoiw should I be doing it instead?
[15:59:16] <duch_kazatel> bind an event handler and go from there.
[15:59:19] <FlightOfGrey> I must have found a really old example to base this off of then
[15:59:36] <FlightOfGrey> Ok, thanks
[15:59:37] <duch_kazatel> your current issue is that clicks on the child anchors are bubbling up and triggering the parent show/hide
[15:59:43] <FlightOfGrey> Yeah
[15:59:48] <duch_kazatel> fsure.
[15:59:52] <FlightOfGrey> When I only want the title to be doing the toggling
[16:00:14] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/328457
[16:00:25] <duch_kazatel> fuse405 that's not a screenshare is it?
[16:00:53] <duch_kazatel> FlightOfGrey yeah - I'd bind a click handler to the 'header' specifically to handle that.
[16:01:34] <duch_kazatel> fuse405 ah just a weird paste service.  mind creating a fiddle instead?
[16:01:44] <FlightOfGrey> Ok, and that way I would still be able to close the child divs only, rather than having to specify the exact id for each header title?
[16:02:19] <duch_kazatel> FlightOfGrey you should look at event delegation for that :)
[16:02:21] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, you can do that.
[16:02:34] <FlightOfGrey> Ok thanks a lot for your help
[16:02:49] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[16:02:57] <dave_s> Okay, home for real this time,.
[16:03:01] <dave_s> Later all.
[16:03:30] <duch_kazatel> enjoy
[16:03:46] <FlightOfGrey> The jquery documentation says nothing about it being depreciated :S
[16:04:01] <FlightOfGrey> Thank goodness I asked here
[16:04:15] <duch_kazatel> yes it does :)
[16:04:24] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[16:04:38] <FlightOfGrey> Ah I was looking here http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[16:04:49] <duch_kazatel> yep, you're not using that method signature
[16:05:00] <Tomashe> duch and dave_s thanks
[16:12:13] <timothy_mccallum> Would you like to write a Wordpress plug-in for Google Summer of Code 2014? http://techteam.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/write-a-wordpress-plug-in-for-google-summer-of-code-2014/
[16:38:12] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[16:38:21] <duch_kazatel> hello.
[16:39:48] <Toerkeium> lets say I use this events  .ajaxStart() and ajaxStop() to show a message when an ajax call is started, is there any way I could show another message when for example, I have a sintax error of javascript and it stops execution instead of never reaching the ajaxStop() event?
[16:40:22] <duch_kazatel> did you look at all the ajax events?
[16:40:47] <Toerkeium> yes, I saw the ajaxError, but it doesn't trigger at a javascript error, at least not a sintax js error
[16:41:00] <duch_kazatel> wait where is the syntax error?
[16:41:31] <Toerkeium> duch_kazatel: lets say you call a webpage using ajax which contains javascript
[16:41:42] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* is there an error in the returned JSON?
[16:41:46] <duch_kazatel> or actual code?
[16:42:03] <Toerkeium> in the returned code
[16:42:18] <duch_kazatel> so you're returning actual javascript code, not just data?
[16:42:25] <Toerkeium> yes
[16:42:28] <duch_kazatel> that is a bad idea.
[16:42:32] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[16:42:52] <Toerkeium> I get webpages with ajax, which includes javascript code
[16:42:59] <Toerkeium> shouldn't do it?
[16:43:01] <duch_kazatel> yep - bad idea.
[16:43:26] <Toerkeium> how do you handle to not to do that?
[16:43:42] <duch_kazatel> you put all your code into a file and include the file....
[16:44:20] <Toerkeium> but it would be a lot, imagine lot of pages not being called it will be included anyway and it could not be used by the user
[16:44:30] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't be that much.
[16:44:41] <duch_kazatel> you're not dynamically generating things like event handlers, right?
[16:45:00] <Toerkeium> not really
[16:45:10] <duch_kazatel> then how much code is it?
[16:45:21] <Toerkeium> I just use ajaxStart and ajaxStop to show a modal windows after 3 seconds with a "be patience..." message
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> dynamically loading javascript is a bad idea.
[16:45:37] <duch_kazatel> that's my answer.
[16:45:41] <Toerkeium> well... lot of datepickers and that kind of stuff
[16:45:47] <duch_kazatel> uh, wat?
[16:45:49] <duch_kazatel> proof?
[16:46:04] <Toerkeium> it's a entire jquery app
[16:46:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:46:10] <Toerkeium> entirely
[16:46:13] <duch_kazatel> still not making sense.
[16:46:16] <Toerkeium> sorry, my english is not good
[16:46:25] <duch_kazatel> put your logic in javascript files, include those, and then load data.
[16:46:43] <duch_kazatel> do not load non-data through ajax.
[16:48:00] <Toerkeium> I'll see how I can do it, btw... why?
[16:48:10] <duch_kazatel> separations of concern.
[16:48:14] <Toerkeium> why is not a good idea I mean
[16:48:19] <duch_kazatel> separations of concern.
[16:48:22] <Toerkeium> oh, ok
[16:48:37] <duch_kazatel> also: it winds up being heavier since most browsers don't handle caching correctly.
[16:49:58] <Toerkeium> so, agains javascript errors, any way to do something? It was interesting to me to be able to logs them on a database for a later revision
[16:50:01] <Toerkeium> I had that idea
[16:50:22] <duch_kazatel> send JSON, not program code.
[16:50:24] <duch_kazatel> that make sense?
[16:50:30] <Toerkeium> yes yes
[16:50:46] <Toerkeium> thinking about undefined values or that kind of stuff
[16:51:11] <Toerkeium> or some kind of problem with a function when it's called
[16:54:00] <Toerkeium> ok, well.. thanks for the help
[16:57:38] <Shackleford> I have an .ajax request using a username and pw https://gist.github.com/anonymous/301e15417b1f4b43aa01  it looks like it is connecting but when I try to view the object in the console I get an "Object {error: "Unauthorized access"}"
[16:58:07] <Shackleford> does this mean the authentication is failing (seems obvious) or is it something else?
[17:02:15] <duch_kazatel> looks like it means authentication is failing.
[17:03:03] <Shackleford> so in the property data:
[17:03:14] <Shackleford> I put in { "comment" }
[17:03:18] <Shackleford> and now it seems to be working
[17:03:29] <Shackleford> but I don't understand why, any advice?
[17:04:44] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:07:35] <duch_kazatel> back
[17:07:49] <Tomashe> Anyone here using topcoat css?
[17:07:54] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Tomashe
[17:07:54] <b-ot> Tomashe: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:07:58] <Tomashe> hehe
[17:07:59] <Tomashe> ok
[17:08:07] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford no clue how your API is setup.,
[17:08:53] <Shackleford> such,_kazatel, I think I figured it out
[17:08:59] <duch_kazatel> cool
[17:09:21] <Shackleford> { ''" } works just the same, it just needed a format of the data
[17:10:19] <Shackleford> so now that I have the object in the console, do I need to .getJSON to iterate through each item, to plug into the view?
[17:10:28] <Shackleford> am I thinking this through coorectly?
[17:10:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?  no.
[17:10:43] <duch_kazatel> you could do all kinds of things.
[17:10:57] <duch_kazatel> a for...in loop, an .each()...
[17:11:04] <duch_kazatel> have an example of the data?
[17:11:38] <Shackleford> yea one sec.
[17:16:41] <Shackleford> duch_kazatel here is a sample of the JSON https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c2969e9767af89e029a9
[17:17:22] <Toxicandy> So I am using the Jquery UI and when I do the bounce effect or slide right/left my element jumps down a line before jumping back to it's correct position. The website is http://midwestcornstarz.com and the problem is the facebook link in the top left. Any help?
[17:18:53] <duch_kazatel> Shackleford yeah just use iterators.
[17:19:18] <Shackleford> is that a new jquery function outside of the .ajax?
[17:19:42] <Shackleford> or now that the object is in the browser I can just use the object "data"
[17:20:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:20:14] <duch_kazatel> that's now javascript.
[17:20:27] <Shackleford> got it
[17:20:59] <Shackleford> hey man Thanks for all the help thus far.  It took me a while but glad I at least got the JSON to the console
[17:21:18] <duch_kazatel> of course.  you'll get better and better :)
[17:21:25] <duch_kazatel> you're doing the right things.
[17:21:35] <Shackleford> thx for the vote of confidence!!
[17:22:15] <Lehl0r> can someone tell me what is the best way to save what has been compared in two for loops
[17:22:22] <Lehl0r> so i have 2 nested loops
[17:22:25] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r share some code.
[17:22:40] <Lehl0r> yeah well sec
[17:23:18] <Toxicandy> Can I get some help with a problem regarding positioning issues with the jquery-ui
[17:24:00] <duch_kazatel> Toxicandy I can't event understand wtf your problem even is.
[17:24:16] <Lehl0r> http://pastebin.com/78FpqqBu
[17:24:22] <Lehl0r> so i have these two loops
[17:24:22] <Toxicandy> I sent a link, when I hover over it the span drops a line and then reapears after it's effect
[17:24:56] <Lehl0r> and i thought that i can somehow build an assoziative array
[17:25:02] <Lehl0r> to keep in mind
[17:25:08] <Lehl0r> where a connection appears
[17:25:17] <Lehl0r> but the line 9
[17:25:25] <Lehl0r> give me somehow an endless loop
[17:25:31] <Lehl0r> or results in a timeout
[17:25:50] <Lehl0r> the linehash['id'+...
[17:26:05] <Lehl0r> can't i built it up like that ?
[17:26:05] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r can you setup a functioning example in jsfiddle?
[17:26:54] <Lehl0r> well dunno an example for these i thought it is kind of an easy question
[17:27:15] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r it's hard ot know the best solution because i don't know what your data looks like.
[17:27:34] <duch_kazatel> Toxicandy looks like you need to fix the styles getting appllied there.
[17:27:34] <Lehl0r> well the data doesnt matter i guess
[17:27:50] <Lehl0r> all i want to know is the following:
[17:27:51] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r actually it does.
[17:28:04] <Lehl0r> i have a loop x and inside that is a loop y
[17:28:06] <duch_kazatel> but for your basic question, yes, you can generate property names dynamically.
[17:28:10] <mikeche1en> what does the lineshash() function do
[17:28:20] <Lehl0r> its no function
[17:28:32] <Lehl0r> so wait let me explain
[17:28:36] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:28:40] <Lehl0r> so i have loop x and loop y
[17:28:44] <duch_kazatel> be aware that javascript doesn't have "hashes" or "associative arrays" btw.
[17:28:47] <duch_kazatel> just objects.
[17:28:49] <mikeche1en> oh its an array
[17:28:52] <Lehl0r> i know
[17:28:59] <duch_kazatel> actually, lineshash is an object, mikeche1en
[17:29:03] <Lehl0r> y
[17:29:08] <Lehl0r> and now
[17:29:13] <Lehl0r> i go through these loops
[17:29:20] <Lehl0r> and compare a and b for instance
[17:29:34] <Lehl0r> and since i found what i want
[17:29:40] <Lehl0r> i dont want to compare b with a
[17:29:40] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r if that's the right approach, declare a var before the loop, like var myData = {}l
[17:29:42] <Lehl0r> afterwards
[17:29:47] <duch_kazatel> err, myData = {}
[17:29:51] <duch_kazatel> then add your info to that.
[17:29:52] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: yah i noticed that after a minute
[17:30:04] <Lehl0r> yeah i did that
[17:30:19] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r then what's the problem?
[17:30:26] <Lehl0r> so linehash = new Object();
[17:30:29] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:30:30] <duch_kazatel> not that.
[17:30:34] <duch_kazatel> don't use new in this case.
[17:30:44] <duch_kazatel> declare an object up top - var lineHash = {};
[17:30:50] <Lehl0r> i also tried {}
[17:31:15] <Lehl0r> the output results strangely in a timeout
[17:31:33] <duch_kazatel> your logic makes absolutely no sense.  TweetsFromDaysBefore and tweetsCurrentDay are arrays?
[17:31:39] <duch_kazatel>  like var myData = {}l
[17:31:39] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:19:17:29:42] <Lehl0r> afterwards
[17:31:40] <mikeche1en> Lehl0r: you might want to log output of the values of s, g, and that lineshash array value
[17:31:42] <duch_kazatel> wtf.
[17:31:47] <duch_kazatel> for (var s = TweetsFromDaysBefore; s < TweetsCurrentDay; s++) { - this makes no sense.
[17:31:57] <duch_kazatel> s will never be lower than itself.
[17:32:04] <Lehl0r> they are not arrays
[17:32:18] <duch_kazatel> then why are you using array iterators?
[17:32:31] <duch_kazatel> (and wrong, i might add)
[17:32:54] <Lehl0r> well lets just keep to the point that the loop itself works fine ^^
[17:33:00] <Lehl0r> however the only problem is
[17:33:01] <duch_kazatel> no, actually it doesn't.
[17:33:04] <duch_kazatel> the loop is wrong.
[17:33:14] <duch_kazatel> s is set to the entire data structure TweetsFromDaysBefore
[17:33:20] <Lehl0r> aeehm no
[17:33:29] <Lehl0r> believe me its not
[17:33:37] <Lehl0r> its just a part of the whole thing
[17:33:37] <duch_kazatel> i am literally copy/pasting from your incomplete pastebin.
[17:33:56] <Lehl0r> i know lets just say the loop itself is fine
[17:34:01] <mikeche1en> its hard to tell what is going on without knowing what values the vars are actually holding
[17:34:02] <Lehl0r> what is not working is the fact
[17:34:15] <duch_kazatel> if you want to enumerate through an object, use for (var prop in object) {}
[17:34:30] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r you're giving us an incomplete, wrong code example.
[17:34:37] <Lehl0r> no i dont ^^
[17:34:46] <Toxicandy> duck_kazatel: is there a certain .effect(...) that will allow text or an object to slide but have an effect where it slides in instead of appearing then sliding?
[17:34:51] <Lehl0r> you just dont get the simple problem somehow ^^
[17:34:58] <Lehl0r> let me explain again:
[17:35:07] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r no, I do, and I'm trying to explain why your current approach is broken.
[17:35:21] <duch_kazatel> Toxicandy huh?
[17:35:38] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r TweetsFromDaysBefore is a number?
[17:35:46] <Lehl0r> yes
[17:35:51] <duch_kazatel> that is terrible naming.
[17:36:17] <Lehl0r> well who cares for the naming now
[17:36:34] <Lehl0r> i just have the problem that i want to keep track of what has been compared
[17:36:41] <Lehl0r> i have a nested loop
[17:36:50] <Lehl0r> and when i found that a and b = x
[17:36:58] <Lehl0r> i dont want to compare b and a again
[17:37:03] <Lehl0r> thats the whole thing
[17:37:07] <duch_kazatel> create an object and add properties i guess.
[17:37:12] <Lehl0r> i tried to add an object
[17:37:14] <duch_kazatel> or find a more efficient way to compare the arrays
[17:37:15] <Lehl0r> which is linehash
[17:37:32] <duch_kazatel> where are you declaring it?
[17:37:41] <Toxicandy> I am using .effect(  "slide", {direction: "right"}, 500); on a span element and the element is set to Display: none; when the page is loaded so when a user hovers over a certain area the span uses that .effect.... to slide in but the slide effect makes the text appear then the effect slides across the text and then it reapears. can I make it so it slides open basically. it starts as nothing and slides to reveal the text?
[17:38:10] <duch_kazatel> Toxicandy ... huh?  you want the text to look like it's sliding in/out of the icon?
[17:38:34] <Toxicandy> Yeah. I am going to add a background around it but yes, exactly that
[17:39:20] <duch_kazatel> Lehl0r also, the iterators won't compare two values twice the way you're doing it.
[17:39:38] <Lehl0r>  yes they do
[17:39:46] <duch_kazatel> uh, huh?
[17:39:47] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:39:48] <Lehl0r> since they are taking it from the same array
[17:39:58] <duch_kazatel> you're comparing an array against itself, then?
[17:40:04] <Lehl0r> yep
[17:40:16] <duch_kazatel> do you want to remove duplicates from this array?
[17:40:23] <Lehl0r> no
[17:40:46] <Lehl0r> i give you more context :
[17:40:52] <Lehl0r> i have two points on a map
[17:40:54] <duch_kazatel> you're just comparing the array against itself for shits and giggles?
[17:40:55] <duch_kazatel> noooo.
[17:41:07] <Lehl0r> when something x happens
[17:41:15] <Lehl0r> i draw a line from point a to b
[17:41:28] <Lehl0r> however i dont want to draw the line from b to a again
[17:42:09] <duch_kazatel> your entire setup sounds strange to do that.
[17:43:51] <Toxicandy> duch_kazatel I feel kind of dumb, I just found that you can use .show(...) to correct my problem.
[17:44:02] <duch_kazatel> there you go :)
[17:44:31] <Toxicandy> But you did help in that I got it all on one line by putting it in a small table because none of the CSS was working correctly
[17:46:25] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:49:20] <FlightOfGrey> Alright I am back, having fixed my issue of using deppreciated functions. But now I can't seem to figure out a way to have only the title doing the slide toggling. As when it slides down you can click on the content to slide it back up, I understand why it's doing that as that content is inside of the div which has the event handler. But I can't figure out how to make a function which when you
[17:49:21] <FlightOfGrey> click the title ONLY the information that is under that title is shown/hidden.. How should I be looking at the problem, is there other ways other than using children? http://jsfiddle.net/3gpfc/68/
[17:50:45] <decx> instead of $('.dropdown').click do $('h2','.dropdown').click
[17:51:26] <decx> may have to reroute your traversing with children
[17:52:37] <FlightOfGrey> So you mean in the html? How they are positioned?
[17:53:17] <decx> you can also check the event target
[17:53:44] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3gpfc/69/
[17:54:49] <FlightOfGrey> Ahh you're awesome, been struggling with this for like 3 hours, trying different traversing functions and everything
[17:54:59] <FlightOfGrey> And all i needed was a simple check.
[17:55:41] <decx> this is a more direct approach http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3gpfc/70/ binding the event directly to the h2 and then traversing to next, instead of searching for a child
[17:55:41] <FlightOfGrey> Actually, thanks so much for your time. So helpful.
[17:56:53] <FlightOfGrey> yeah I had been trying to get next to work, but it still had similar effects, is there any preference of either method?
[17:57:29] <decx> e.target based can be a pain, i prefer direct binding
[17:58:44] <FlightOfGrey> Ok good to know, again thanks a lot for your help decx.
[17:59:00] <decx> say you have a elements in your h2, when you click the h2, the event target might be an img, or a span. or whatever is inside that h2. and checking for all those circumstances with e.target is ineffective
[17:59:35] <FlightOfGrey> Makes sense.
[18:00:40] <FlightOfGrey> Thanks again, you have ended hours of pain and frustration and going around in circles, for the moment at least haha.
[18:00:55] <decx> also there's slideToggle so you don'T actually need that clicks stuff
[18:01:20] <decx> but it's a good way if you have more advanced states
[18:03:08] <FlightOfGrey> Ah there is some toggle way, damn I knew there had to be a simpler way. I had been trying using toggle() which I only found out before was depreciated in 1.9. But this is certainly good enough, and like you say can be added to without having to change too much.

[18:48:16] <axilaris> hi, u guys know of a good js/jq that works "perfectly" for price inputs... always displays 0.00 this format... etc
[18:48:23] <axilaris> this is the best i found http://jquerypriceformat.com/
[18:49:25] <axilaris> any better ?
[18:50:08] <jphase> I normally use the masked input plugin since it can be used for any mask, not just pricing:  http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[18:50:53] <jphase> either that or just write something custom :\
[19:01:54] <axilaris> jphase: thanks. let me have a look
[19:02:20] <jphase> might not be exactly what you need. I normally know the character limits and such :\
[19:02:49] <axilaris> jphase: looks nice
[19:03:07] <axilaris> works with other formats too
[19:03:11] <axilaris> like date phone etc
[19:03:28] <axilaris> maybe not so well on price
[19:03:52] <axilaris> well it can.
[19:04:00] <axilaris> just need to know the character limit
[19:04:07] <axilaris> like u mentioned
[19:04:38] <axilaris> like this i believe $("#price").mask("9999.99");
[19:05:04] <jphase> yeah, you can also define your own masking characters
[19:05:28] <axilaris> thanks for the tip...
[19:06:12] <jphase> sure thing. just a heads up, it can take a second to get it to work properly with validation if you're using front-end validation on your forms
[19:06:30] <jphase> it can be done but the ______ it adds to the input makes some validation get confused when it's just "required" for example
[19:08:35] <axilaris> i dont understand.. what kind of validation ?
[19:08:48] <axilaris> u mean like ranges ?
[19:08:53] <axilaris> date ranges ?
[19:08:58] <axilaris> number ranges ?
[19:19:36] <jphase> axilaris: as in any js/jquery/html5 form validation
[19:19:46] <jphase> like <input type="text" required>
[19:20:17] <axilaris> i didnt know there is required attribute...
[19:20:22] <axilaris> was thinking onsubmit
[19:20:24] <jphase> html5
[19:20:26] <axilaris> validation
[19:20:29] <jphase> yeah that too
[19:20:51] <axilaris> thanks for another tip :)
[19:20:51] <jphase> so, required is an html5 attribute, and a lot of onsubmit handlers that jquery/js validation uses will hook into that as well
[19:20:57] <jphase> sure thing
[19:21:06] <axilaris> just checking w3shool on required
[19:21:59] <Thav> I upgraded recently to 1.11, and I have a $(document).ajaxSend that sends a csrf token.  After the upgrade this doesn't fire on send.  I don't know where to start looking for the problem, does anyone have any pointers?
[19:22:10] <axilaris> required is just not empty
[19:22:12] <axilaris> isnt it
[19:22:29] <jphase> w3school is evil, use MDN from now on ;)
[19:22:55] <jphase> and required="required" is for IE <= 8 or something (which is officially dead in 2 weeks)
[19:23:09] <jphase> required by itself with no value is completely valid for html5
[19:24:00] <axilaris> oh
[19:24:14] <jphase> Thav: "If $.ajax() or $.ajaxSetup() is called with the global option set to false, the .ajaxSend() method will not fire."  <--- you checked that?
[19:24:51] <axilaris> This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before submitting a form. It cannot be used when the type attribute is hidden, image, or a button type (submit, reset, or button). The :optional and :required CSS pseudo-classes will be applied to the field as appropriate.
[19:24:56] <Thav> jphase: let me check, I don't think I've ever set that.
[19:24:56] <axilaris> thats from MDN...
[19:25:21] <axilaris> didnt say empty fields would work with html5
[19:25:50] <axilaris> actually if required works for all latest browser..forget about IE9 below
[19:26:02] <axilaris> i wonder if it works with "select"
[19:26:25] <jphase> axilaris: http://html5doctor.com/css3-pseudo-classes-and-html5-forms/
[19:26:26] <axilaris> want to do something that unselect... there is always a value in there
[19:26:36] <axilaris> unless i make an option without a value
[19:30:09] <axilaris> Safari supports all of it too, but form validation is disabled by default.
[19:30:11] <axilaris> hmm
[19:30:16] <bengalo> jphase thx for pointing that out about w3school, im already stunned by the <input> page...
[19:31:14] <jphase> w3schools is for people that code in ASP classic ;)
[19:31:59] <Jattenalle> hey now, i look random stuff up on w3s every now and then when i forget the order of things in shorthand CSS :P
[19:32:05] <Jattenalle> so it's good for something :3
[19:32:06] <bengalo> well, normally i just need a quick overview to remember the things and i thought that w3 was helpful for that but wow mdn
[19:32:51] <jphase> well, they do still have higher SEO than MDN, but MDN has much more information and is laid out like usage docs
[19:33:01] <Jattenalle> jphase, link?
[19:33:14] <jphase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
[19:33:29] <bengalo> they sure do have higher seo lol
[19:33:36] <jphase> specifically google:     "whatever you want to know site:developer.mozilla.org"
[19:34:07] <bengalo> already added the search bar addon for mdn ;)
[19:40:22] <axilaris> haha i found the info on select required http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_select_required.asp
[19:40:26] <axilaris> sorry w3school
[19:40:39] <axilaris> but here's a useful info... not supported in any major browser
[19:42:59] <jphase> yeah, selects are lacking in most browsers
[19:43:25] <axilaris> actually thats not right this works with select required
[19:43:26] <axilaris> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6048710/can-i-apply-the-required-attribute-to-select-fields-in-html5
[19:43:36] <axilaris> u just need a value option that is empty
[19:44:06] <axilaris> i want to try with safari is it true that is disabled by default
[19:44:50] <axilaris> it is disabled
[19:45:04] <jphase> btw, it does work on firefox
[19:45:13] <jphase> I think it also works on chrome latest too (required on select)
[19:46:11] <axilaris> works on chrome
[19:46:59] <axilaris> i prefer html5 than handling it onsubmit... reduce the work... real validation can then be done on the backend
[19:47:15] <axilaris> prevalidation... on html5 sounds good enough
[19:47:21] <axilaris> safari..
[19:47:23] <axilaris> well
[19:47:38] <jphase> depends on how old your end-users are and if they're still using moldy stuff like Windows XP and a crap browser ;)
[19:47:49] <axilaris> true
[19:48:22] <axilaris> forget about the oldies :)
[19:48:31] <jphase> axilaris++
[19:48:52] <axilaris> thats why... there are deprecation happening everywhere
[19:49:45] <jphase> I always use the acid test to show my clients why old browsers aren't supported unless they pay 72% more money :)
[19:50:58] <axilaris> thats another good tip !
[19:51:31] <axilaris> funny..trying with the html5 ranges didnt work...
[19:51:39] <axilaris> just getting hook in this validation thingy :)
[19:51:51] <jphase> hmm, you can probably use the pattern attribute for that axilaris
[19:51:58] <jphase> which is the dopest part of html5 validation imo
[19:52:07] <axilaris> html5 without js/jq
[19:52:10] <axilaris> :)
[19:52:28] <axilaris> let me check it out
[19:52:36] <axilaris> what this dope u r talking about
[19:52:52] <jphase> http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-introduction-and-new-attributes/
[19:52:58] <jphase> see the "pattern" section ;)
[19:53:11] <jphase> pass regex right into the attribute and do your own validation :D
[19:53:35] <jphase> IE9 breaks on this stuff too btw
[19:54:40] <axilaris> thats actually neat... another thing without js ...
[19:54:59] <axilaris> i dont know
[19:55:23] <axilaris> when there are more of this... onsubmit maybe the better place .. and u could put in place better validation
[19:55:41] <axilaris> well... i think keep it simple and this would work
[19:55:47] <axilaris> and backend to do the real stuff
[19:56:15] <jphase> true, I'm totally not a purist. I use jquery validation all the time
[19:56:28] <axilaris> at the end of the day, backend cant accept any crap
[19:56:39] <jphase> and plenty of it at that. jquery validation + that mask plugin + backend + html5 on some things :\
[19:56:57] <axilaris> u r right..do whats practical
[19:57:13] <jphase> for anyone wanting a good laugh, IE8 on acid3 test:  http://snag.gy/BSa7s.jpg
[19:58:39] <axilaris> that must be the oldest IE i'ved seen
[20:00:14] <axilaris> wonder how much IE8 < percentage in the market ?
[20:00:43] <axilaris> that would be nice statistic to tell on demographics of this
[20:04:30] <axilaris> codes for patterns http://html5pattern.com/
[20:05:00] <axilaris> i should go to html5 channel instead
[20:05:35] <Jattenalle> axilaris, IE <9 is at < 10%
[20:05:49] <Jattenalle> as of mid 2013, so probably even lower nwo
[20:05:50] <Jattenalle> now*
[20:05:59] <axilaris> good to know, thx
[20:06:04] <Jattenalle> http://theie8countdown.com/
[20:06:05] <Jattenalle> :P
[20:06:40] <tds5016> how would I get the width of everything within a div?
[20:06:44] <tds5016> excluding the parent div?
[20:06:56] <Jattenalle> what's interesting though, is that IE8 is still ahead of IE10
[20:07:03] <tds5016> so.... <div id='1'><div id='2'>lotsa stuff</div></div>
[20:07:16] <tds5016> I want to check the size of div id 2 with only knowing about div id 1
[20:07:17] <Jattenalle> (still = was in june of 2013)
[20:07:43] <jphase> tds5016: $('#div1 > div').width() ?
[20:07:48] <axilaris> probably people dont use IE that much anymore
[20:07:55] <tds5016> that's likely to work :-)
[20:08:00] <Jattenalle> here we go, up to date stats http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php
[20:08:04] <Jattenalle> no idea how accurate
[20:08:27] <Jattenalle> it's also probably a safe bet that anyone using IE < 9 isnt a potential customer/visitor to your site
[20:08:32] <Jattenalle> and more likely some lost grandma or spambot
[20:09:36] <axilaris> Jattenalle: nice one
[20:09:51] <jphase> actually, you'd be surprised at how many corporations (like wells fargo, citibank, etc.) required XP SP1 on their machines internally
[20:10:10] <jphase> which is pretty sketchy considering a lot of us are customers at said companies
[20:10:12] <Jattenalle> jphase, not surprised, i've worked as a contractor for companies like that
[20:10:30] <Jattenalle> shitty cheap companies that know nothing, with management guys who think they know what they're doing and refuse to budge
[20:10:44] <jphase> they're all relying on their dated vbscripts to roll out domain policies and such
[20:10:51] <jphase> brb
[20:15:23] <axilaris> min and max does work <input id="quantity" name="quantity" type="number" min="1" max="8000" maxlength="4" required />
[20:15:28] <axilaris> there is no need for pattern
[20:17:23] <jphase> yeah on type number for sure
[20:17:31] <jphase> also no need to use /> in html5 :)
[20:49:47] <rhizome> if i have an #id in the form of "word_2343", is .match worse than .split at all, or is there a best practice for extracting the number?
[20:51:22] <jphase> rhizome: if there's only one occurrence of word_ then perhaps just use var number = $(this).attr('id').replace('word_', '');
[20:52:04] <jphase> might need to parseInt() around that too, not sure
[20:53:32] <jphase> but match and split will work just fine too. match will allow you to have any ol' crazy string mixed anywhere within the numbers. depends on your application
[21:07:06] <rhizome> jphase: thanks. yeah, match fits my regex habit nicely and doesn't appear to require me to supply an array index. replace might be a little lighter even still, i guess :)
[21:15:16] <jphase> rhizome: looks like your way is better anyhow http://jsperf.com/regex-vs-replace-in-string  ;)
[21:27:47] <Starcraftmazter> whats the differnce between window.function and $(window).function?
[21:29:55] <jphase> Starcraftmazter: jQuery DOM objects come with some added stuff in them as they return in a form you can chain other jQuery methods to. They essentially call the same function but the latter returns the jQuery DOM object for chaining and some other things in there. You can console.log each of them and see the difference in greater detail.
[21:30:50] <Starcraftmazter> ok cool
[22:13:31] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[22:13:40] <Starcraftmazter> im trying to look into orientation change on mobile
[22:13:50] <Starcraftmazter> but the problem is, when that event executes, the css/layout hasnt changed yet
[22:13:55] <Starcraftmazter> is there a way to hook into the end of that?
[22:16:19] <jphase> Starcraftmazter: are you using jquery mobile?
[22:18:24] <Starcraftmazter> jphase: probably not?
[22:18:26] <Starcraftmazter> its a responsive site
[22:19:42] <jphase> hmm, media queries and all css rules should be applied before any orientation events fire. there's orientationchange and resize events, but the media queries will deliver css content before those events fire
[22:20:24] <Starcraftmazter> the way ive done it is to put a 100 ms timeout on the stuff inside the event
[22:20:27] <Starcraftmazter> which seems to do the job
[22:20:30] <Starcraftmazter> but not ideal of course
[22:21:57] <jphase> it sounds like you're trying to do something that requires some css content that draws/loads elements like calculating width or height perhaps?
[22:22:47] <jphase> what are you trying to accomplish?
[22:52:07] <Starcraftmazter> jphase: push footer down below viewable window for mobile
[22:52:15] <Starcraftmazter> on change from landscape to portrait and back as well as onload
[22:52:20] <Starcraftmazter> but ive done it already so its all good
[22:59:12] <steevenz> hi all
[23:00:28] <steevenz> any user online?
[23:05:02] <steevenz> hmm so quite
