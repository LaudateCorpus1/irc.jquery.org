[01:18:28] <amccloud> What would cause ui slider to be glitchy? it somewhat works but the log is flooded with
[01:18:29] <amccloud> "jquery-ui.min.js:14 Uncaught TypeError: Object 29991000 has no method 'toFixed". I'm using latest jquery and jquery-ui
[01:20:49] <dr1337> hmm just stubmled across a weird bug
[01:21:04] <dr1337> fade animations are choppier on safari and chrome compared to firefox and ie
[01:23:30] <MACscr> im having a brain fart, shouldnt this add the class to the parent list item that contains an anchor that meets matches the current href? I know the path variable is correct. $('#main-nav a[href$="' + path + '"]').parent().find('li').attr('class', 'current');
[01:25:08] <MACscr> er, maybe that should be closest() instead of parent().find()
[01:25:13] <MACscr> though that doesnt seem to work either. hmm
[01:25:24] <MACscr> nvm, it did. lol
[01:31:05] <dr1337> anyone know why this may be and how to optimize it?
[01:50:39] <aqeel> hi room
[01:50:50] <aqeel> would love to get some help...
[01:51:38] <donCams> aqeel, just ask
[01:51:40] <coldhead> could you be more specific?
[01:51:56] <aqeel> sorry got busy...
[01:52:30] <aqeel> i want to use jquery to simply widen the width but of specific like get total window width - 200px
[01:52:55] <aqeel> where minwidth is 1000px...
[01:53:02] <donCams> ?
[01:53:23] <Cancerus> ?
[01:53:37] <aqeel> liquid column....???
[01:53:45] <donCams> ah
[01:54:17] <aqeel> some mon are small and some are big thus leaving a small gap on sides and taking rest of the screen
[01:54:28] <donCams> i haven't tried liquid column. can't help you there. don't know if CSS can do it though.
[01:54:55] <aqeel> yes it can but uses %
[01:55:08] <aqeel> which somebrowsers have problems with
[01:55:47] <donCams> $(window).width() :3
[01:57:06] <aqeel> ok
[01:57:22] <aqeel> now if ii reduce browser window will it affect too?
[01:57:50] <aqeel> will resizing my browser window have affect on this...
[01:58:03] <MACscr> be patient, sheesh
[01:59:07] <aqeel> sorry i did not see on my side...thought mught not have gone through....
[01:59:48] <aqeel> my browser got pdated and flickered...sorry
[02:00:03] <donCams> aqeel, yes it would
[02:00:11] <MACscr> web based irc? eww
[02:00:29] <donCams> sorry $(document).width()
[02:00:56] <donCams> argh... no. $(window).width() would return viewport width
[02:01:48] <aqeel> ok now can this be done get the mon width and -200px and keep that to be static
[02:02:06] <MACscr> yes, assign it to a var and do the math
[02:02:14] <aqeel> viewport???? mon or browser (being resized)
[02:02:18] <donCams> aqeel. $(window).resize(function() { console.log($(this).width()); } );
[02:03:27] <coldhead> body {width:80%}
[02:03:42] <aqeel> but i would like to keep the full size width even if the browser is being resized...???
[02:04:03] <donCams> aqeel, do the math :) that would be spoonfeeding
[02:04:39] <aqeel> i can do the math but want to confirm which command will help me keep my values static even on resizing...
[02:04:51] <aqeel> i have my values...
[02:05:08] <MACscr> what do you guys think i should do design wise when it comes for displaying the Status of each of these forms? Should i add an column that says Status and just put "Completed" or "In Progress" for each one? or maybe just change the background color of the row? or maybe instead of the words, have an image like a checkmark, etc? http://screencast.com/t/L82t6cwYtm. This is obviously just an opinion question.
[02:05:27] <donCams> aqeel, then have some condition to maintain min width
[02:06:45] <donCams> MACscr, check icon would be pleasing for me
[02:06:50] <aqeel> ok....will this work if i specifiy my min width in css and my dynamic width in js?
[02:07:20] <donCams> maybe a progress bar if you want :)
[02:09:52] <aqeel> well css % will increase the gap as the mon size increses.....but with js i can simply minus 200px and the space is constant with any mon size..
[02:10:57] <aqeel> ok guys thanks for great help....going to implement it...
[02:11:57] <MACscr> donCams: if i use a checkmark for complete, what should i use for in progress?
[02:12:19] <donCams> MACscr, a div?
[02:12:58] <MACscr> donCams: no, thats the Status. There wont be any type of progress bar
[02:13:14] <MACscr> the form is either In Progress or Completed
[02:13:32] <MACscr> maybe no icon at all for In Progress?
[02:14:50] <donCams> MACscr, http://cssdeck.com/item/156/twitter-bootstrap-progress-bars
[02:14:53] <donCams> css3 :) hehe
[02:15:21] <MACscr> lol, i dont need a progress bar as there is no percentage.
[02:15:29] <donCams> argh
[02:16:02] <MACscr> its either started or complete. Wouldnt make sense to have progress bar for that
[02:16:13] <donCams> then have icons instead. and when they hover over the icon, show the text meaning
[02:16:23] <donCams> or have legend above
[02:16:57] <MACscr> lol, so back to the beginning. What icon for In Progress?
[02:16:57] <donCams> aqeel, simple css like this would do the trick i guess http://jsfiddle.net/LZv4Z/
[02:17:48] <donCams> why don't you have it like the stoplight colors? it's universal. yellow for in progress. green for completed. red for not yet taken
[02:18:12] <MACscr> good idea. simple enough
[02:18:20] <donCams> yes. make it simple
[02:20:32] <aqeel> nice one ...width: auto !important; this does indeed did the trick but i want that - 200px....so i guess i can css - this via jquery
[02:21:21] <aqeel> thanks alot
[02:41:50] <rookie84> what is jsonp (i do know json)
[02:42:39] <rexamophone> hey there
[02:42:53] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/c7fGz/
[02:42:59] <aqeel> please have a look
[02:43:11] <aqeel> and -200 not working as aspected
[02:43:13] <rexamophone> i'm kida stuck trying to use JQ to select a javascript object
[02:43:45] <rexamophone> ie: a page connection is left open and periodically the server sends down new <script> blocks updating the page (poor mans ajax) and dumps a new object as a "var"
[02:44:29] <rexamophone> i'm passing a block to a click event somewhere and i want to access the var that is being pushed to the page
[02:44:46] <rexamophone> am i barking up the wrong tree trying to do this with JQ?
[02:53:58] <Browser> Hello
[02:55:47] <Browser> I have a variable  which i want to show in one page in a div. The page before is form. Should i use Ajax with POST ? Or maybe other action to  show the variable?
[02:59:23] <dr1337> so a sample of my website at http://msrcc.org.au/mob/PA clearly shows that FF and IE9 render the fadein and fadeout smoother than Chrome and Safari
[03:00:39] <aqeel> any eras?
[03:06:45] <JKarsrud> dr1337: I think that might be related to the use of requestAnimationFrame compared to the jquery internal $.fx.interval
[03:07:21] <dr1337> JKarsrud: any ideas how i can fix this?
[03:07:27] <dr1337> seems to be a webkit issue
[03:08:07] <MACscr> aqeel: have you ever used js? your not even loading the function
[03:08:33] <MACscr> nor do you even have jquery loaded
[03:09:19] <MACscr> nvm, you do have the function loaded, though i never use that style
[03:09:26] <MACscr> but you dont have jquery loaded
[03:17:35] <JKarsrud> dr1337: well, because requestAnimationFrame is supposed to be faster, I don't really know..
[03:21:02] <aqeel> and how is taht done.....for what i read......$(function{}); load in itself
[03:21:42] <aqeel> well yes...i do use js and alot..it is just i am using jquery now
[03:26:00] <Browser> If i want to show a variable in my page, Do i need a previous event to execute the function ? The problem is that i write $('div #confirmacionfinal').html('ads');  for example but don't exist in the DOM in this moment. The page before is a form. Thank you.
[03:26:54] <JKarsrud> aqeel: you need to load jQuery in jsfiddle too; on the left hand side, there is a dropdown of libraries :)
[03:28:06] <JKarsrud> and the loadWidth function should be inside $(function() {}); too, though it's not required. It just makes sure that the code isn't run before the document is ready
[03:28:11] <JKarsrud> as in done loading
[03:28:32] <aqeel> oh ok..
[03:28:35] <Krinkle> Hi, I was wondering if anyone recognizes this problem.I'm creating an element in JavaScript, giving it a style property and appending it to the DOM (as part of a unit test). Then the test will call a function in our library that is selecting elements on the page that have a [style] attribute (using the Sizzle selector engine). For some reason the appended elements are not being matched (as if the browser hasn't synchronized the cssText into the style=""
[03:28:35] <Krinkle> attribute yet).
[03:28:41] <JKarsrud> and on jsfiddle, you don't have to supply stuff like doctype and head :)
[03:29:06] <Krinkle> $("<div>").css('fontFamily', 'Foo, serif').appendTo('body'), then indirectly it does $('body').find('[style]').
[03:29:14] <Krinkle> When done line by line from the console it works fine
[03:29:26] <Krinkle> but when done within a function, it doesn't work
[03:30:21] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/c7fGz/1/
[03:30:51] <aqeel> loadwidth is the funtion wrapping the jquery to be called from html body
[03:30:51] <JKarsrud> aqeel; I'm cleaning it up a bit for you now
[03:31:47] <giri> where are the codes for Qclock..
[03:31:50] <aqeel> thanks....
[03:32:20] <JKarsrud> I don't know what you're trying to do with the whole containerclassic.css() tho? Are you trying to get the width?
[03:32:43] <aqeel> i just need to get window - 200 px to the contentclassic id
[03:32:53] <aqeel> yes
[03:32:57] <JKarsrud> okay
[03:33:38] <FJ1> hi
[03:33:58] <giri> guys pls does any one know the Qlock codes....pls...
[03:35:46] <JKarsrud> aqeel: I don't suppose this helps you that much, as I don't know what you're trying to do, but here is a cleaned up fiddle atleast: http://jsfiddle.net/c7fGz/2/
[03:36:15] <aqeel> thanks
[03:37:27] <JKarsrud> I would actually make that loadwidth-function into a function expression
[03:37:58] <JKarsrud> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/c7fGz/3/
[03:41:39] <Zerpex> any that knows how jsperf.com calculates the time?
[03:43:36] <speyburn> hey guys, im still strugling with this problem, i cant get the value from the text input :/ http://jsfiddle.net/2ckbK/
[03:45:48] <aqeel> well not working
[03:46:05] <EdwardIII> hey
[03:46:55] <EdwardIII> i'm playing with autocomplete. i can see it's sending the xhr requests, i know my json provider at the other end is definitely providing json, but it seems like success: isn't getting triggered? i have a console.log in there that isn't printing
[03:47:16] <EdwardIII> here's the JS: https://gist.github.com/1744954
[03:47:43] <horizon> hello
[03:48:14] <EdwardIII> ah, i was using jsonp when i should have been using json
[03:49:56] <horizon> why if i write a script as $('#id').click(...more stuff...); it works if i create in the html code an element as <p id='id'>hello</p>, but if i create the p element from a jquery script with .append for example, the previous script doesn't work?
[03:51:17] <JKarsrud> horizon: you need to use .on() with a delegate/live syntax to work with dynamically created elements
[03:51:34] <horizon> thanks 1k =D
[03:52:41] <JKarsrud> $(document).on('click', '#id', handler);
[03:52:44] <JKarsrud> for instance
[03:52:57] <horizon> yep :D i'm reading the doc
[03:53:11] <JKarsrud> or maybe something more specific like $('someParentElement').on('click', '#id', handler)
[03:53:12] <JKarsrud> :)
[03:56:17] <horizon> JKarsrud, it works for click =D but it handle also focusout?
[03:56:40] <JKarsrud> sure, any event
[03:56:52] <horizon> wow fantastic *_*
[03:57:03] <JKarsrud> .click() is just shorthand for $('selector').on('click', handler); so :)
[03:57:20] <JKarsrud> it's how the new event binding in jquery works, see
[03:57:30] <JKarsrud> from 1.7
[03:58:00] <aqeel> $(function() {$(window).width($('#containerclassic').width() - 200);});
[03:58:05] <aqeel> not working
[03:59:02] <JKarsrud> aqeel: well, setting the window width could be a but hard, but you could try to set $('body').width() ?
[04:00:00] <aqeel> i want to set the width from screen - 200 px and must stay static ....when browser resizes this must remain same...
[04:00:15] <aqeel> using body will it remain same after resizing...
[04:00:20] <speyburn> any ideas on this one ->
[04:00:20] <speyburn> 13:42 -!- gasbakid [~gasbakid@41.96.9.56] has joined #jquery
[04:00:24] <speyburn> damn..
[04:00:28] <speyburn> misscopypaste
[04:00:43] <speyburn> sry.. lets try again: any ideas on this one ->http://jsfiddle.net/2ckbK/
[04:00:49] <speyburn> here we go :)
[04:01:19] <JKarsrud> aqeel: well, then you need to reset it on resize, tho
[04:01:55] <donCams> speyburn, what are you trying to do?
[04:02:06] <JKarsrud> that goes for window _and_ body. I don't really know what you're trying to achieve tho.. unless you sett the width of the container larger than the window in the first place, it wouldn't work I think
[04:02:29] <speyburn> donCams: im trying to get the value from the text field
[04:02:31] <JKarsrud> without knowing more about what you're trying to do, it's kinda hard to help :)
[04:02:47] <speyburn> there is a typo actually, a#otto-submit -> #otto-submit but it wont still work :/
[04:02:55] <fatninja> hello people. I want to create the following effect : when I hover a td form a table, I want the corresponding column title of that td to change it's color , how can I achieve this effect ? ( I want to count the td lets say it's n'th, to see which place it is, then add a class to the n'th td in table header. )
[04:04:19] <JKarsrud> speyburn: first things first; include jquery in the page from the left hand library dropdown
[04:04:22] <aqeel> ok sample .......i have knwon width 800px thus i want my page to load wihin 700px; but now i have large monitor its width is 1000px and i want my page to load within 900px...i want to get this width with javascript and - 200px from it to give it to my page
[04:04:51] <JKarsrud> speyburn: and then, another thing, would be to read the inputs value on click, not before you click it
[04:04:56] <JKarsrud> otherwise it will be empty :)
[04:05:48] <speyburn> JKarsrud: ...... its always the little things? :D
[04:06:02] <donCams> speyburn http://jsfiddle.net/2ckbK/4/
[04:06:09] <JKarsrud> speyburn: indeed! Tell me if you're struggling
[04:06:11] <speyburn> damn.. thank you so much, i struggled with this probably 2 hours but guess i should have gone to sleep
[04:06:41] <donCams> bad habit of mine. i use .on() :3
[04:08:34] <fatninja> I have a td within a tr in a table, how can I see if it's the 1st td , the 2nd , the n'th ?
[04:08:50] <fatninja> I'm talking about it's position in the table row
[04:09:14] <JKarsrud> fatninja: index()?
[04:09:21] <fatninja> checking it out...
[04:09:42] <JKarsrud> donCams: seems kinda redundant to actually make a link trigger submit tho..
[04:09:45] <donCams> fatninja, if you're selecting, http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[04:10:10] <fatninja> I kinda do both , but index seems to offer me the trick :D
[04:10:12] <donCams> JKarsrud, well, it's a link not a submit button that's being clicked
[04:10:40] <JKarsrud> yes, but how do you know the form is gonna be submitted? ;)
[04:11:02] <JKarsrud> nah, I'm just pulling your leg here, it just seemed silly. Why not change the markup instead? :)
[04:11:25] <JKarsrud> I get what you've done, I'd probably do the same thing myself, but then I'd use on for the submit as well ;)
[04:11:36] <donCams> :)
[04:11:58] <donCams> well yeah. i should be using <input type="submit"> instead of a link.
[04:12:25] <donCams> unless he wants to disable submitting the form when javascript is disabled... don't get it though
[04:12:26] <horizon> JKarsrud, sorry if i'm broking you XD but to implement $("#int").numeric(); i have the same problem
[04:12:50] <JKarsrud> is numeric a plugin?
[04:14:00] <JKarsrud> You'd need to initialize the plugin after you've added the element to the dom, using a reference or something
[04:14:21] <fatninja> 	var nth = $(this).parent().index($(this));
[04:14:23] <horizon> JKarsrud, uhm right
[04:14:24] <fatninja> this returns -1
[04:14:35] <horizon> thanks again
[04:14:50] <JKarsrud> so if you do var int = $('<input id="int" />');
[04:15:10] <JKarsrud> you have a reference to that dom node, and can "use" it
[04:15:17] <JKarsrud> if that helps at all horizon :)
[04:15:48] <JKarsrud> or you could try to reselect it using a context in the selector: $('#int', context).numeric();
[04:20:56] <donCams> fatninja http://jsfiddle.net/tL2an/1/
[04:21:16] <fatninja> donCams: yes, thank you I managed to make it work :d
[04:21:21] <donCams> ok :)

[06:41:50] <Putr> _cb: i had a feeling it was as slow, or slower. Or is it just me and my slow comp
[06:42:17] <_cb> Try it, if it does not work nothing lost.
[06:43:23] <black_warlock> Nobody knows how to display feeds there ?
[06:45:52] <evident> hi everybody!
[06:45:58] <Putr> _cb: nevermind.. I'm an idiot. thanks :)
[06:48:46] <evident> I am having a little newbie question: I have loop in which I create multiple <select...> elements each with a unique ID "sensor"+i (where I is the index in the loop).  Also I create a .change() function for each select like $('sensor'+i).change(function{...});
[06:49:18] <evident> In this change() function I now want to get the value of the selected option as well as the amount of options available...
[06:49:50] <evident> But how do I access the options of the <select> for which the change() function is executed?
[06:52:27] <gabri> Hi people
[06:52:40] <gabri> I am a newbie with jquery library
[06:52:59] <gabri> I create a simple input text and a very simple function in this website http://www.servidor-online.com/celiacos/?accion=registrar
[06:53:02] <black_warlock> if i have var entry = feeds.entries[i]; how can discover which are all the entries ?
[06:53:32] <gabri> My function is http://www.servidor-online.com/celiacos/javascript/funciones.js so i can't see any error
[06:53:36] <black_warlock> alert( feeds.entries[i])  give alerts only [object object]
[06:54:33] <_cb> black_warlock what is inside entries[i] ?
[06:55:50] <black_warlock> this is the code
[06:55:51] <black_warlock> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-feeds-api-jquery-plugin.html
[06:56:05] <black_warlock> the first grey square
[06:56:23] <black_warlock> do you see that var entry = feeds.entries[i];
[06:56:23] <black_warlock>     entry.title;
[06:56:42] <black_warlock> i wish to know how  can i pull all the feeds
[06:57:01] <black_warlock> i have made a div id="feeds"
[06:57:04] <black_warlock> $('#feeds').html(entry.title + "<br />"+ entry.post );
[06:57:13] <gabri> hi _cb
[06:57:29] <black_warlock> how can i pull out all the entries properties
[06:57:57] <black_warlock> like date , descriptio , summary or whatelse is inside that entries[i]
[06:58:03] <_cb> evident you could use the this keyword or pass the select id as  a parameter and then do $("#.." + id)...
[06:58:36] <_cb> black_warlock am not familiar with feeds
[06:58:50] <gabri> anyone can see any error in this code please? http://www.servidor-online.com/celiacos/javascript/funciones.js
[06:59:16] <black_warlock> gabri check the name
[06:59:21] <black_warlock> the code its right
[06:59:26] <gabri> the name is correct
[06:59:31] <black_warlock> but the jq is case sensitive
[06:59:50] <gabri> the html is:  <input class="text" id="user_login" style="width: 350px;" name="user_login" size="30" type="text" />
[06:59:57] <black_warlock> it doesnt work ?
[07:00:09] <gabri> it does't work
[07:00:18] <gabri> it is my first time with jquery
[07:00:33] <black_warlock> try to put that code inside a $(document).ready(function(){  HERE   });
[07:01:23] <gabri> black_warlock:  it is work with your code!!
[07:01:50] <black_warlock> -.- ofc
[07:02:46] <_cb> black_warlock  feeds.entries[i] is an object. You can alert the object properties (like the title)
[07:03:08] <black_warlock> but how to know the list ?
[07:03:29] <black_warlock> entry.title ok
[07:03:33] <black_warlock> but the others ?
[07:04:19] <_cb> black_warlock I am not familiar with feeds and thus don't know what the properties are
[07:05:16] <black_warlock> i guess must use each
[07:05:18] <black_warlock> .each()
[07:05:49] <_cb> if  I load a page from /root/html and am doing a $("#div").load("page.htm") from /root/bizdir/b2/htmldir how should I code the 'src' for 'img' inside page.htm if the images are in the same folder as page.htm?
[07:08:54] <black_warlock> use absolute path
[07:08:59] <black_warlock> for the images
[07:10:24] <black_warlock> src="/root/bizdir/b2/htmldir/image.jpg"
[07:12:24] <black_warlock> Where is Eviltwin
[07:12:32] <black_warlock> =(
[07:13:14] <kavelot> i need to interrupt my script (breakpoint) when a user clicks an element on the page... I know about $('#id').data("events").click; , but I couldn't set the breakpoint... any hints?
[07:16:36] <muzone> Eviltwin: can u wait 2 more weeks please
[07:16:51] <muzone> sorry for the inconvenience :/
[07:21:36] <_cb> black_warlock as much as I don't want too I think I am going to have too. I have /root/b1/htmldir  /root/b2/htmldir If I could have gone relative I would not have to put b1,b2... into the source
[07:28:23] <black_warlock> well
[07:28:31] <black_warlock> you can compile it dinamically
[07:29:14] <_cb> eventually I will generate the code from a database so I guess it does not matter all that much
[07:30:55] <black_warlock> for images i use always absolutes paths
[07:31:20] <black_warlock> because if when i recall other pages inside other pages in other locations it will never fail
[07:32:16] <black_warlock> i know its not polite and that a website must have tree ordinate structure
[07:33:18] <black_warlock> but since with jQ qe can mix and recall other contents which is a really usefull function i've started to use this trick for images
[07:42:09] <aqeel> i can't believe how miss guided the people can be....
[07:42:28] <aqeel> such a simple code was needed....$(function() {$("#containerclassic").width($(window).width()-40);});
[07:43:43] <d2s> Sometimes simple things are the most difficult.
[07:43:45] <d2s> Sadly.
[07:46:08] <black_warlock> Eviltwin ? are you with us ?

[09:47:55] <Godfather_> hi
[09:48:21] <Godfather_> why when i click first time on the input with value='El Corte Ingles' the value doesnt get empty? http://jsfiddle.net/9HcgQ/
[09:48:35] <Godfather_> for the second input "nombretienda" it works
[09:49:51] <mansoor> Godfather_, $(this).val(),arr)==1  theres your problem
[09:50:01] <mansoor> that gets turned into a true
[09:50:07] <mansoor> true in javascript = 1
[09:50:12] <mansoor> so no Zero for you~
[09:51:23] <pifantastic> Godfather_: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/8MQMQ/1/
[09:51:52] <pifantastic> Godfather_: it would be better to use the placeholder attribute

[09:53:55] <pifantastic> ?inArray @ Godfather_
[09:53:56] <Godfather_> jQuery.inArray($(this).val(),arr) <- this evaluate to 1 or -1

[09:54:17] <pifantastic> Godfather_: read that ^

[09:54:20] <pifantastic> it explains it
[09:54:46] <sroy2> does anyone know a way to load locally stored json files? I was trying $.getJSON() but it wasn't working.
[09:54:48] <Godfather_> pifantastic lol, it returns his own index
[09:54:48] <Godfather_> sorry
[09:55:10] <pifantastic> sroy2: what do you mean locally stored?
[09:55:38] <poweratom> can't you just load it via a variable and make the content of the file inside of that variable?
[09:56:00] <sroy2> no server - I was trying to use jquery/js to load local json files from the same directory as the html file
[10:01:49] <WorkingStorage> anyone have a quick jquery/javscript routine to strip out non-ascii characters (like smart quotes from Word) from a textarea?

[10:06:53] <zCoder> what if its the only thing on the page nothing else to laod
[10:07:54] <ngharo> still your script is executing before #bigger exists
[10:08:10] <cambrian> I have a page with dynamically generated drop down menus. I want to have one that will override / set all of them to the same value. How can I acomplish this?
[10:08:12] <ngharo> you could throw your script at the bottom of the page and it'll work, but just use ready.

[10:23:52] <sviatovigt> I found a tutorial on the internet that uses new Date() to generate the current date
[10:24:10] <sviatovigt> where can I find information about the Date class?
[10:24:51] <ngharo> h1ll37: you're passing an incorrect arg to setInterval
[10:25:14] <ngharo> sviatovigt: google 'mdn Date'
[10:25:25] <ngharo> mdn roxors
[10:26:13] <ngharo> or just play around in your console
[10:26:52] <sviatovigt> but this is not a jquery class?
[10:27:04] <h1ll37> ngharo: okay i put quotes around the function now but it won't work at all

[12:22:55] <padd173> (I want to use it too...)
[12:23:02] <pifantastic> padd173: they are frames
[12:23:08] <padd173> no they're not
[12:23:14] <padd173> not html frames at least
[12:23:23] <h1ll37> pifantastic: oh thank you (;
[12:23:27] <padd173> try right-clicking on one to see
[12:23:42] <pifantastic> padd173: looks like  a frame to me: http://grimhappy.com/i/d51c2f0.png
[12:24:26] <black_warlock> pifantastic thank u =)
[12:24:36] <pifantastic> np
[12:24:45] <padd173> pifantastic: ok, It's an iframe, but iframes normally don't resize... the code they used to make them resize must have come from some library
[12:25:48] <padd173> it's an iframe inside a div - the resizing could have easilly been done with the iframe taken away
[12:25:58] <padd173> and the result would still look like frames
[12:26:45] <pifantastic> padd173: Mootools
[12:26:50] <padd173> DANKE!

[12:55:06] <Elena-rus> hello
[12:56:14] <Elena-rus> has anyone noticed that some of the generic jquery mobile icons look too pixelated and unaesthetic on android devices?
[12:56:33] <chee> :o
[12:56:49] <Elena-rus> such as notext home icon. I wonder if there are any workarounds?
[13:03:51] <bradmaxs> redsquare: can you also tell me whey it is only getting my first image size and not the second?
[13:04:37] <redsquare> bradmaxs it alerts twice for me
[13:05:29] <redsquare> but dont you need to find the child of the current icon
[13:05:35] <bradmaxs> redsquare: it does for me as well but the images are not both 150 - one is 267  I think the loop must be wrong
[13:05:49] <bradmaxs> ugh:(
[13:06:34] <redsquare> bradmaxs http://jsfiddle.net/druUp/3/
[13:06:51] <redsquare> yeah - you need to find the image inside of the icon class div
[13:07:28] <bradmaxs> redsquare: you are awesome - I have been trying to do this all day.  thank you thank you thank you!
[13:07:37] <redsquare> ha:) np
[13:08:38] <bradmaxs> redsquare: and it actually makes sense now.
[13:09:32] <redsquare> good
[13:09:54] <redsquare> so - what were you doing wrong?
[13:09:59] <redsquare> just to check:)
[13:12:43] <bradmaxs> redsquare: I hadn't defined $this to refer to the .icon and to make it reusable and I wasn't finding the image properly to get the height?
[13:13:01] <redsquare> yup - you were just using the first one all the time
[13:13:23] <bradmaxs> redsquare: :) thanks!
[13:19:57] <multiHYP> hi all
[13:20:15] <multiHYP> i have a question regarding the scroll to top function in jquery.
[13:20:42] <Eviltwin> I didn't know jQuery had a "scroll to top" function
[13:20:57] <multiHYP> it works well for existing links, but if elements and such #top links are dynamically added to the page, they don't have such behaviour.
[13:21:24] <multiHYP> Eviltwin: no, its an anonymous function, but is commonly used for that purpose.
[13:21:30] <Eviltwin> Then it
[13:21:31] <multiHYP> to animate to the top of the page
[13:21:33] <Eviltwin> 's not a jQuery function
[13:21:43] <Eviltwin> jQuery functions are here: http://api.jquery.com/
[13:22:11] <multiHYP> $(window).scroll(function(){…});
[13:22:43] <redsquare> be carefull using that multiHYP
[13:22:46] <multiHYP> that looks jquery to me if you want a specific example.
[13:23:08] <redsquare> no
[13:23:14] <redsquare> its the window scroll event
[13:23:15] <Iarfen> Hi
[13:23:18] <redsquare> http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/
[13:23:19] <multiHYP> redsquare: the animation i do inside that works for existing elements. dynamically added elements don't animate.
[13:23:28] <Eviltwin> You realize there's a difference between a "jQuery function" and a function that uses jQuery, right?
[13:23:44] <Iarfen> I need a function like text(), but I don't want to get the "text" of the elements inside the element I select, only the "text" of that element, NOTHING MORE, what can be that??
[13:24:14] <multiHYP> so using $(document) instead?
[13:25:19] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: Um...
[13:25:21] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:25:39] <Eviltwin> <b>Hello, <i>World!</i> How <i>are</i> you?</b>
[13:25:52] <Eviltwin> What would the text of <b> be in that case?
[13:26:07] <multiHYP> any idea why this animation (animate scroll to top) works for static elements?
[13:26:20] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: Because event bindings are static
[13:26:54] <multiHYP> so what do i need to do in javascript to make it applicable to new and dynamically added elements?
[13:26:55] <Henrike_BR> hello
[13:26:58] <Henrike_BR> i need some help
[13:27:05] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: Completely depends on the context
[13:27:12] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: I'm a tell you to see ?demo
[13:27:15] <bot-t> multiHYP, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:27:26] <Henrike_BR> the $(window).resize doesnt working with IE
[13:27:27] <Eviltwin> Come back when you have a jsFiddle containing this scrolling code
[13:27:31] <multiHYP> it involves server side code
[13:27:41] <Eviltwin> I'm not telling you to copy your website into it
[13:27:52] <Eviltwin> I'm telling you to make a brand spanking new example
[13:27:58] <Eviltwin> With just enough code to show the problem
[13:28:46] <Eviltwin> As a hint, see ?jdb
[13:28:47] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[13:28:54] <Eviltwin> This example should be small
[13:28:58] <Eviltwin> Just enough to illustrate the problem
[13:29:05] <Henrike_BR> can some help me? $(window).resize doesnt work with IE
[13:29:22] <Eviltwin> Henrike_BR: see ?demo see ?jdb
[13:29:23] <bot-t> Henrike_BR, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[13:29:42] <Eviltwin> I can promise you it works when used correctly
[13:32:47] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: It wolud be Hello, you?
[13:32:54] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: I'm clear??
[13:33:29] <Henrike_BR> Eviltwin: look at.. www.iwrk.com.br/boxbrasilgt
[13:33:56] <Henrike_BR> Eviltwin when you resize with firefox the menu font size decrease
[13:34:09] <Henrike_BR> Eviltwin with IE dont resize
[13:34:12] <multiHYP> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/L3BAg/
[13:34:53] <multiHYP> that works, but if after loading that page, you add more divs with that #top link to the page, they won't animate. why?
[13:39:48] <multiHYP> anything? Eviltwin or others
[13:40:05] <redsquare> ? on @ multiHYP
[13:40:06] <bot-t> multiHYP, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:41:17] <multiHYP> redsquare: instead of defining the handler once, should i do it for every single #top anchor-link?
[13:41:41] <Henrike_BR> Is there an event for Restore Size Button on the Browser?
[13:42:22] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: Try replacing $('a[href*=#]').click(... with $(document).on('click', 'a[href*=#]', ...
[13:43:44] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: do you know??
[13:44:00] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: Do you speak English?
[13:44:06] <redsquare> :)
[13:44:12] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: A little, yes, why?
[13:44:25] <multiHYP> that breaks my whole smooth scrolling
[13:44:35] <multiHYP> and is not helping me with my question
[13:44:49] <Henrike_BR> Is there an event for Restore Size Button on the Browser?
[13:44:53] <Eviltwin> Henrike_BR: No
[13:45:29] <multiHYP> seriously, why dynamically added anchor-links won't do smooth scrolling and simply jump to the top?
[13:45:32] <Henrike_BR> Eviltwin: do you know a way how can i control this event?
[13:45:43] <redsquare> multiHYP http://jsfiddle.net/L3BAg/2/
[13:46:02] <Eviltwin> Henrike_BR: Here's how: You cannot control it, sorry.
[13:46:20] <redsquare> multiHYP did you try it?
[13:46:27] <Eviltwin> Probably not
[13:46:36] <Eviltwin> Or he's using an older jQuery
[13:46:51] <Eviltwin> In which case he'd need $(document).delegate('a[href*=#]', 'click', ...
[13:47:01] <multiHYP> redsquare: ok works again, but doesn't explain the smooth scrolling not working for dynamically added anchor links
[13:47:05] <Eviltwin> Or he's using a really, really old jQuery in which case he's...uh...special...
[13:47:13] <multiHYP> nope
[13:47:16] <multiHYP> I'm on the latest
[13:47:25] <redsquare> so it will work with new links
[13:47:35] <redsquare> try adding some new ones in that fiddle
[13:47:37] <redsquare> and see
[13:47:39] <multiHYP> well 1.3.2
[13:47:43] <redsquare> :)
[13:47:50] <redsquare> latest eh
[13:47:59] <multiHYP> its not my choice though, comes with the package
[13:48:07] <redsquare> so it will break you
[13:48:32] <multiHYP> anyway, smooth scrolling works, but for existing elements. not for dynamically added ones. <- 100x
[13:48:45] <redsquare> you can roll your own delegation, or hack it and use .live multiHYP
[13:49:18] <multiHYP> its a simple javascript problem, and i cannot explain it.
[13:49:38] <redsquare> my word, do you listen or read what we say
[13:49:46] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/L3BAg/3/
[13:50:23] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: One important thing to note, 1.3.2 ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO BEING THE LATEST VERSION OF JQUERY
[13:50:40] <multiHYP> Eviltwin: try adding some more #top links after the page is loaded, are those animating too?
[13:50:51] <Eviltwin> Yes, flawlessly
[13:50:58] <multiHYP> no it doesn't
[13:51:06] <Eviltwin> No, it does
[13:51:06] <multiHYP> give some example please
[13:51:10] <Eviltwin> I just fucking linked it
[13:51:12] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/L3BAg/3/
[13:51:20] <multiHYP> oh wait
[13:51:32] <redsquare> Eviltwin can you code it into his server instead
[13:51:45] <redsquare> remember the 1.3.2 thang
[13:51:52] <multiHYP> it doesn't work for me
[13:51:55] <multiHYP> same code :(
[13:52:03] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: That'd because you went full retard and used jQuery 1.3.2
[13:52:13] <Eviltwin> Which in case you've forgotten again, isn't latest
[13:52:23] <multiHYP> i didn't the whole package makes use of 1.3.2
[13:52:29] <multiHYP> i know
[13:52:44] <redsquare> what is this whole package
[13:52:55] <multiHYP> is there a way of testing it on the fly with newer jquery version?
[13:52:57] <Eviltwin> First, I'd like you to apologize to us for lying and saying you were using jQuery latest
[13:53:12] <multiHYP> it is latest available to me
[13:53:38] <multiHYP> yes sorry you are absolutely right
[13:53:49] <Eviltwin> Now I'm going to give you a solution
[13:53:53] <Eviltwin> A solution that's so horrible
[13:53:57] <Eviltwin> It caused me pain to type it
[13:53:58] <multiHYP> thanks for your wonderful help, Eviltwin and redsquare. you were brilliant!
[13:54:02] <Eviltwin> Because it's just so horrible
[13:54:15] * redsquare ducks
[13:54:20] <Eviltwin> But if you absolutely cannot upgrade to 1.4.2 or beyond
[13:54:26] <Eviltwin> You can use this: http://jsfiddle.net/L3BAg/4/
[13:54:30] <Eviltwin> It's slow
[13:54:32] <Eviltwin> It's ugly
[13:54:35] <Eviltwin> And it hides what's really happening
[13:54:38] <black_warlock> guys
[13:54:44] <Eviltwin> But it should work fine for 1.3.2
[13:54:49] <black_warlock> jquer mobile its lighter ?
[13:55:06] <black_warlock> is it better for mobile ?
[13:55:19] <Eviltwin> I believe it also includes a bunch of mobile-specific UI
[13:55:22] <Eviltwin> But I don't know
[13:55:24] <Eviltwin> I've never used it
[13:55:48] <multiHYP> nope, in my case all the above solutions fail
[13:55:52] <black_warlock> do you have iphone ?
[13:55:55] <multiHYP> i don't know what went wrong
[13:56:13] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: View the source of your page and make sure the new code is actually there
[13:56:25] <avalarion> How to get the object out of my selector?
[13:56:38] <Eviltwin> Then follow the instructions at see ?ftj to learn more about debugging
[13:56:39] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:56:44] <Eviltwin> And see if there's another error causing this one
[13:56:52] <Eviltwin> avalarion: Uh.....what?
[13:57:33] <black_warlock> do you think compressed jquery lib will have faster load time ?
[13:57:33] <multiHYP> actually .live disables the smooth scrolling for existing elements even
[13:57:37] <avalarion> Eviltwin: I have got a method, which has got the param e... I am calling $(e).doMagick();
[13:58:02] <Iarfen> No one can help me?? :S
[13:58:03] <avalarion> Eviltwin: If you want to fire the methode with methodName($('#element')); it will not run, or?

[13:58:31] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ avalarion
[13:58:33] <bot-t> avalarion, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[13:59:23] <multiHYP> the only thing so far working is my old .click(..) version, which as mentioned won't act on added elements.
[13:59:44] <Iarfen> I need a function like text(), but I don't want to get the "text" of the elements inside the element I select, only the "text" of that element, NOTHING MORE, what can be that??
[14:01:23] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: And why in God's name do you want that?
[14:01:55] <multiHYP> so the only explanation for that is that older jquery versions cannot do that thing?
[14:02:00] <multiHYP> larfen: .value
[14:02:07] <Eviltwin> multiHYP: Is this live on your site somewhere?
[14:02:15] <multiHYP> no locally testing
[14:02:17] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: because I'm creating a cha
[14:02:21] <avalarion> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/wXiHWUgy better?
[14:02:29] <Eviltwin> A cha?
[14:02:42] <Iarfen> I have a div like that: <div><img>Nick of the user<p>New Messages</p></div>
[14:02:50] <Iarfen> I want to select only the nick of the user
[14:02:52] <Iarfen> xD
[14:02:55] <Iarfen> that's the reason
[14:02:58] <Eviltwin> avalarion: A selector object...?
[14:03:08] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: That's called being lazy
[14:03:12] <Eviltwin> Stop that right now
[14:03:37] <avalarion> Eviltwin: its an Jquery Object... it has got all the jquery object methods...
[14:03:40] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: Why that's lazy??
[14:03:53] <Eviltwin> avalarion: And...?
[14:04:04] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: I'm not lazy, you understand bad
[14:04:30] <avalarion> Isn't the call in the method than $($('#myObject')) ? Or would it run like it is now?
[14:05:16] <Eviltwin> Have you ever tried $($('#myObject')) ?
[14:05:38] <Eviltwin> var a = $("#myObject"); var b = $(a);
[14:05:41] <Eviltwin> b is now a copy of a
[14:06:10] <avalarion> a copy or a link?
[14:06:32] <Eviltwin> A copy
[14:06:36] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: http://jsfiddle.net/yV52C/
[14:07:07] <avalarion> okay, but it I want to append thinks they will be append in the dom with both objects, am I right
[14:07:07] <avalarion> ?
[14:07:32] <multiHYP> Eviltwin: I manually added the newer jquery 1.7.1 to the project and it works. hopefully my colleagues won't destroy me. I'm the only jquery user here around. :(
[14:07:33] <Eviltwin> You really don't understand JavaScript, the DOM, or jQuery, do you?
[14:07:57] <avalarion> Eviltwin: I am mostly doing Java or PHP^^.
[14:08:05] <redsquare> jQuery: code first, learn later
[14:08:36] <redsquare> multiHYP did you remove the older version also
[14:08:42] <xodusman> anyone familar with mootools?
[14:08:47] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ avalarion
[14:08:48] <bot-t> avalarion, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:08:51] <redsquare> and switch to using on rather than live
[14:08:59] <redsquare> xodusman #mootools
[14:09:00] <Eviltwin> xodusman: Pretty sure there's a channel for it
[14:09:03] <multiHYP> redsquare: yes, it works great with .on() method
[14:09:03] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[14:09:25] <multiHYP> thanks again guys
[14:10:15] <Eviltwin> avalarion: Until you actually learn JavaScript and jQuery, the best you can be doing is randomly putting pieces of code together and hoping that they work
[14:11:01] <Eviltwin> When people do that with chemicals from under their kitchen sink, they ususally die
[14:12:36] <black_warlock> Eviltwin
[14:12:36] <spiffie> but sometimes they get teflon!
[14:13:05] <black_warlock> if ill use jquery in a mobile page
[14:13:21] <black_warlock> is it better to use normal jq or minified version
[14:14:26] <Eviltwin> Well the unminified is always larger
[14:14:35] <Eviltwin> More bytes to download
[14:14:46] <black_warlock> time of loading is less with minified rite ?
[14:14:56] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:15:22] <black_warlock> which effect use less memory ?
[14:15:31] <black_warlock> .css or .toggle ?
[14:15:50] <black_warlock> i mean when i show hide a div
[14:16:04] <redsquare> css
[14:16:22] <black_warlock> toggle had larger function ?
[14:16:32] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: ty!!
[14:32:57] <h1ll37> can i use $("body").append("something"); to put something in the body area of the page/ becauase i can't seem to get it to work
[14:34:26] <emehrkay> append expects a mootools element
[14:34:40] <emehrkay> so something from the new Element constructor
[14:34:56] <emehrkay> wrong room
[14:34:57] <emehrkay> ha
[14:34:58] <emehrkay> sorry
[14:35:05] <h1ll37> emehrkay: so how would i just put images in the body of my page
[14:35:18] <h1ll37> emehrkay: oh darn okay lol
[14:35:37] <emehrkay> i believe you can do $('<img etc…' />').appendTo($('body'));
[14:36:11] <h1ll37> lemme try that.. thanks emehrkay
[14:36:19] <black_warlock> how can i make this script lighter
[14:36:22] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/uDTxD/2/
[14:36:48] <black_warlock> i mean all the articles are in a hidden div
[14:37:02] <black_warlock> but this will make app very slow
[14:37:02] <methoddk> hello
[14:37:34] <h1ll37> emehrkay: didn't work :(
[14:37:37] <black_warlock> i wish to recall the article only if needed in the related div content
[14:37:43] <emehrkay> what did you do h1ll37
[14:37:45] <h1ll37> says it doesn't have an object of append
[14:37:53] <h1ll37> ("<img src='../images/wallpapers/smaller/"+walls[i]+"' name='"+i+"' />").appendTo($("body"));	
[14:38:16] <emehrkay> missing jQuery or dollar sign?
[14:38:47] <h1ll37> emehrkay: that i was. thakns. but still no output lol. no error either now
[14:38:58] <emehrkay> black_warlock: maybe if you didn't select $('#feeds') during every iteration? or even just create a giant string and append it at the end
[14:39:11] <emehrkay> so outside of the loop you'd do
[14:39:52] <emehrkay> var feeds = []; inside of the loop you'd do feed.push('your html'); after the loop do $('#feeds').append(feed.join(''));
[14:40:30] <h1ll37> emehrkay: when i run it in chrome js console it works..
[14:41:08] <h1ll37> emehrkay: got it thanks man
[14:41:13] <emehrkay> check the markup
[14:41:14] <emehrkay> np
[14:41:22] <emehrkay> i forgot why i came in here :)
[14:41:56] <black_warlock> but
[14:41:58] <black_warlock> yes
[14:42:01] <black_warlock> thats rite
[14:42:42] <black_warlock> i think
[14:42:54] <emehrkay> at the end do $('#feeds').html($('#feeds').html() + feed.join(''));
[14:43:00] <black_warlock> sec
[14:43:19] <T-Gunn> anyone kn ow if there is anything specific I have to do to get jquery to work properly when using it with rail3?
[14:43:33] <T-Gunn> ruby on rails 3
[14:43:57] <black_warlock> i think i should make a function that recall the number of feed [i] to extract the article content
[14:44:07] <black_warlock> and place it
[14:44:09] <coldhead> https://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails
[14:44:42] <black_warlock> i mean only when its needed
[14:49:18] <black_warlock> emehrkay how to make an assemled string with jq ?
[14:49:38] <emehrkay> i just showed you how with javascript
[14:49:45] <black_warlock> var MyTotFeed = MyTotFeed +
[14:49:47] <black_warlock> ?
[14:50:07] <emehrkay> yeah that would work, i do believe that joining an array is better though
[14:50:22] <black_warlock> already have an array running
[14:50:30] <black_warlock> i have just to compoose the string
[14:56:24] <emehrkay> black_warlock: try this http://jsfiddle.net/uDTxD/5/
[14:58:09] <emehrkay> and you probably should use delegate instead of live? I believe that is the jquery preferred way to handle delegation
[14:58:16] <emehrkay> or maybe it is on
[14:58:37] <dreinull> what's the secret to getting source set? $('.typeahead').typeahead({source: function(query) {$.get("/lemmas/autocomplete", {term: query})}})
[15:00:46] <black_warlock> hey
[15:00:50] <black_warlock> i did it i think
[15:01:02] <black_warlock> emehrkay can you check it
[15:01:08] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/uDTxD/8/
[15:01:30] <emehrkay> looks good
[15:01:40] <black_warlock> :D
[15:02:15] <black_warlock> i have setted a random attribute there
[15:02:21] <black_warlock> did you notice ?
[15:02:25] <black_warlock> num=""
[15:03:04] <black_warlock> i wish to call now another function that makes an array with coordinates
[15:03:22] <black_warlock> to extract the entire article
[15:04:10] <black_warlock> it should makes the function faster
[15:14:09] <davorin> anyone here use coffee script?
[15:14:34] <davorin> not sure if this is a good way to define a jquery plugin https://gist.github.com/1748345
[15:15:08] <black_warlock> deaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam
[15:15:27] <Eviltwin> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:15:47] <black_warlock> how can i set changing var inside a for loop ?
[15:16:07] <black_warlock> var MyContent[i] =entry.content
[15:16:44] <davorin>  I mean, there is this example here http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/jquery/plugin, but I wanted to decouple it a bit
[15:17:20] <Eviltwin> You should learn good techniques for writing jQuery plugins in JavaScript and translate those to CoffeScript
[15:17:34] <Eviltwin> Not learn techniques or writing plugins in CoffeeScript and try to translate them to jQuery
[15:18:50] <davorin> Eviltwin: thanks
[15:23:55] <davorin> Eviltwin: Basically, this is what I get in the resulting js -  http://pastie.org/3324378
[15:24:19] <Eviltwin> And that doesn't maintain chainability
[15:24:28] <Eviltwin> And is thus considered to be a bad practice if avoidable
[15:25:39] <davorin> Eviltwin: ok, I guess I still have a lot to learn then, thank you
[15:26:02] <Eviltwin> Read the entire document I sent
[15:26:19] <Eviltwin> It starts out talking about basic strategies and gets into the more advanced, preferred strategies
[15:26:30] <davorin> Eviltwin:  ok, I will
[15:33:18] <black_warlock> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[15:33:23] <black_warlock> I DID IT
[15:33:29] <black_warlock> i dunno how
[15:34:09] <black_warlock> lol
[15:34:28] <black_warlock> i made a loop but i dunno how to make an array
[15:34:32] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/uDTxD/14/
[15:34:49] <black_warlock> the script its faster on mobile
[15:35:21] <black_warlock> but should be still faster
[15:35:28] <black_warlock> halp
[15:38:04] <black_warlock> gosh
[15:38:07] <black_warlock> im an idiot
[15:44:29] <black_warlock> how can i toggle the old content back ?

[15:54:13] <_Pepper> does anyone know what JQuery is build with? I see github and all the seperate .js files for sections/parts of jQuerys' functionality. Yet I am a bit at a lose at what tool the folk use to build it to a single .js file. Thoughts?
[15:54:32] <josiah> I'm pretty sure that its using make
[15:55:07] <_Pepper> yeah I saw the makefile, but can it intelligently merge JS files? that is new for sure
[15:56:02] <_Pepper> if you look at the seperate JS files they are self bundled  (function(JQuery){..all the golden code here ...})
[15:56:44] <_Pepper> so I am not sure how a build system like make knows intelligently merge these code snippets, since the unminified they are all under the var jQuery
[15:57:00] <_Pepper> *knows how to intelligently
[15:59:26] <_Pepper> thoughts?
[16:08:17] <domino14> i'm changing a stylesheet with $("#mylink").attr('href': 'newsheet.css')  but when i do  $(element).css('color') for example, it still has the old value
[16:08:31] <domino14> if i put a delay of a couple seconds between those two calls though, the new value shows up
[16:08:37] <domino14> is that expected?
[16:10:14] <myndzi> is there a simple way to set both the html content of an element and an attribute of it?
[16:15:58] <myndzi> ah, nm
[16:20:41] <domino14> i'm changing a stylesheet with $("#mylink").attr('href': 'newsheet.css')  but when i do  $(element).css('color') for example, it still has the old value. if i add a delay between the calls it works. why is this?
[16:21:13] <_Pepper> domino14 : really depends on what you mean by "is that expected", add a new stylesheet dynamically after the DOM is loaded and painted will take a few moments to propograte to the nodes and thier respective values. There is a slightly different behaviour with dynamic nodes that get created after the new stylesheet is added since the browser usually paints them with the new values.
[16:22:13] <_Pepper> I have expereinced that delay before with older browswers, the newer ones seem to update the nodes quiet quickly, but like anything added after the DOM is painted, there is always a small delay. Makes sense?
[16:23:08] <domino14> is there a signal or something to listen for when the css is done propagating?
[16:23:21] <domino14> we'd like to access the css element in the new stylesheet right away
[16:23:28] <domino14> even if it takes a while to paint
[16:23:54] <_Pepper> the load event usually tell you when the browser is ready with the resource
[16:24:21] <_Pepper> ?load-event
[16:24:23] <bot-t> _Pepper, .load() - Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[16:24:38] <_Pepper> domino14 ?load-event
[16:26:42] <domino14> how do i use .load with the $("#el").attr('href', 'css.css')
[16:29:03] <_Pepper> domino14: $("#mylink").attr('href': 'newsheet.css').load(function() {  // Handler for .load() called. }); should work. JQuery is great for chaining
[16:31:19] <cam_> who can help me?
[16:31:29] <_Pepper> domino14: let me know how you make out with that
[16:31:59] <_Pepper> cam_ : in this chat group, people just ask thier question, if we can help we will answer.
[16:33:25] <cam_> okok thanks
[16:35:23] <cam_> http://jsfiddle.net/GCzgc/
[16:35:57] <domino14> _Pepper: works great, thank you!
[16:36:01] <cam_> when i click "Eliminar" the P should be removed
[16:36:01] <systemfault> I hate people chaining functions for the fun of chainin :/
[16:36:26] <_Pepper> np domino14 glad we could help
[16:36:59] <cam_> but the <p> doesn't disappear when i click "eliminar" link
[16:37:51] <_Pepper> lol systemfault, I agree chaining for chaining is not the best thing, but you have to admit is does come in handy when you do not want to create a reference for a query and just need to do a few things with it.
[16:39:11] <systemfault> _Pepper: Chaining can be wonderful but you should break it when you want to do something that is unrelated.
[16:39:39] <systemfault> .attr().load() makes me cry.
[16:39:47] <cam_> what am i doing wrong?
[16:39:55] <cam_> i think it is aproblem with the selectors
[16:40:19] <spiffie> cam_: your click event isn't being bound because the eliminar link doesn't exist at page load. when you insert new content on the page, you need to either bind a click event to it then or use .on()
[16:40:22] <spiffie> ?on
[16:40:23] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:40:24] <_Pepper> systemfault: I understand to a degree, but this one I think we will have to agree to disagree :) personal preverence
[16:41:52] <domino14> .attr('href', 'newcssfile').load() makes sense though
[16:42:32] <cam_> ok
[16:43:08] <cam_> i will try
[16:45:32] <cam_> i am not sure how to bind a click event when i add content to the div
[16:46:31] <cam_> <spiffie> i am not sure how to bind a click event when i add content to the div
[16:50:58] <_Pepper> cam_ let me play with it a bit, and I will send you the update to show.
[16:51:36] <cam_> ok thanks a lot
[16:54:29] <cam_> this has taken to me about 3 hours
[16:55:58] <cam_> i tried a .on with click method and it doesn't work
[16:56:28] <spiffie> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/GCzgc/8/
[16:57:29] <cam_> it works pretty good
[16:58:41] <cam_> i am trying to uinderstand what you did
[16:58:47] <cam_> thanks a lot
[17:00:30] <spiffie> look over the docs. the method signature is pretty different between on and click (or the other simple event shortcuts)
[17:02:20] <myndzi> ah silly me. you can't set attr 'innerHTML'
[17:02:49] <myndzi> back to the same question i guess then; is there a way to set both the .html value and one or more .attr values without re-selecting an object?
[17:02:52] <skione_> Hi, how do I post the entire page html as a specifical variable with ajax. I have it "sort of work" except the data comes in without a variable name: http://pastebin.com/RnGcwM8Q, if I were doing this with PHP I would use cURL
[17:03:21] <myndzi> you could try .serialize and add the variable name to your query string yourself
[17:03:32] <myndzi> i.e. "html=" + whatever.serialize();
[17:04:59] <SkiOne> thanks
[17:05:03] <SkiOne> trying it
[17:07:11] <_Pepper> cam_ : http://jsfiddle.net/GCzgc/20/ this should show you how to do it using on. It is not optimized, and I have to go get some pizza so let me know if this works for you
[17:07:13] <SkiOne> actually I didn't need to serialize it, just adding html= to the front of the var data worked.
[17:07:14] <bobbobbins> hey, can someone tell me why the numbers in this chart aren't rendering but the title does? http://jsfiddle.net/JyHn3/
[17:08:15] <cam_> yes, this works perfectly too
[17:08:27] <cam_> thanks a lot man
[17:09:05] <Elena-rus> hi all
[17:09:32] <Elena-rus> I cannot seem to get audio work using phonegap + jquery mobile
[17:10:10] <bobbobbins> any ideas?
[17:10:31] <Elena-rus> I have a number of tracks on a single page, they are listed using a <li> tag
[17:10:53] <Elena-rus> then I play them using var ind = $(".pl").index(this);
[17:11:14] <Elena-rus> var src = ind + ".mp3";
[17:11:14] <Elena-rus>         playAudio(src);
[17:11:47] <myndzi> oh right, i guess it wouldn't have been an object if it wasn't adding the name value
[17:11:51] <myndzi> anyway, glad it helped
[17:11:52] <Elena-rus> interestingly, first time I click the tracks it plays, but then I get an undefined error
[17:12:49] <Elena-rus> here's a code of the player http://pastebin.com/0r1QpZCi
[17:13:22] <Elena-rus> I've only editet 109-118 lines to get my audio working
[17:13:29] <bobbobbins> i just don't get it, i think i must be doing something really stupid
[17:13:34] <Elena-rus> the rest of functionality is not really used
[17:15:34] <Elena-rus> I don't need the tracks to be stopped or paused, I dont really have to track the audioposition
[17:15:50] <Elena-rus> cause my tracks are really short, played in a second or so
[17:16:55] <Elena-rus> but if I click multi8ple times on a single track, or a few tracks consecutively, it returns an error
[17:17:06] <Elena-rus> I was wondering where the problem is
[17:23:12] <MACscr> any recommendations on how to adjust this code to make the highlighting work for the table headers as well? http://jsfiddle.net/GQktu/
[17:25:14] <MACscr> Elena-rus: use jsfiddle so their is actual code to test with, not pastebin
[17:26:24] <_Pepper> bobbobins: are you sure you are using Highcharts correctly, I have used the pie chart before, but the numbers you have are not adding up so I beleive that the graph is displaying properly, so maybe a trip to the Highcharts api, and demo page. There is some good examples there

[17:27:40] <bobbobbins> how can they not add up properly? It should just add them all up to calculate the total...
[17:30:11] <_Pepper> bobbobbins : it was a rough guess at the code, did you check the highcharts demo page for pie charts? Sorry this is the jQuery chat, and sometimes if developers have experience with other plugins and/or libraries they can try to help, but the focus here is jQuery.

[17:48:42] <_Pepper> *you
[17:50:42] <_Pepper> Wulf: did that help, if you need to target to get creative and exclude the first and last rows of tables since some tables like to that that you can try the :not pseudo tag.
[17:51:00] <_Pepper> Wulf: it was helpful to me a few times
[17:51:29] <_Pepper> but if your tables are properly formatted ( with tbody, and thead ) then it is even easier.
[17:52:33] <_Pepper> Here is a nice query I used a few times: $(table tr:not(:first-child)') to not get the first row in my results set.
[17:52:55] <methoddk> hrm, this is weird. It works in Safari, but not Chrome. and its not actually writing the html into the source
[17:52:56] <_Pepper> ** $('table tr:not(:first-child)')
[17:53:51] <_Pepper> methoddk: If memory serves, Chrome has some issues with that API and the JSON returned. Did you check FF?
[17:54:04] <methoddk> ff?
[17:54:10] <_Pepper> you are on a windows OS correct? FF = firefox
[17:54:15] <methoddk> no osx
[17:54:23] <methoddk> ooh firefox
[17:54:25] <methoddk> ill check
[17:54:40] <methoddk> ah, chrome thinks its XML

[18:03:52] <methoddk> its the front part of an API request, i didn't post the rest of it
[18:04:54] <_Pepper> ah
[18:05:12] <_Pepper> can you jsfiddle a sample, I can see if I can help
[18:05:54] <methoddk> yeah, one sec
[18:06:09] <methoddk> in firefox the request comes back 200
[18:06:18] <methoddk> so its loading it, but after that its broken

[18:35:18] <DofLeFou> I guess u didn understand my question
[18:35:35] <DofLeFou> your solution will disable it for all the table
[18:35:53] <DofLeFou> I m only looking at disabling it for the first row
[18:36:11] <IgnisDiabolus> ahhh
[18:37:34] <IgnisDiabolus> http://jsfiddle.net/wKHB9/5/
[18:38:47] <DofLeFou> can I do something like
[18:39:01] <DofLeFou> $('.up:first').html("Disable");
[18:39:24] <IgnisDiabolus> then it would change the text to Disable
[18:40:07] <DofLeFou> is that syntax correct tho
[18:40:16] <DofLeFou> or is it something doable
[18:40:35] <IgnisDiabolus> that's correct :3
[18:40:43] <methoddk> anyone use $.getJSON()?
[18:42:12] <_Pepper> sorry methoddk, back now. had to go get some pizza.
[18:42:18] <methoddk> its giving no errors in FF _Pepper
[18:42:41] <IgnisDiabolus> methoddk http://potomak.github.com/jquery-instagram/
[18:43:24] <DofLeFou> IgnisDiabolus: brilliant thank you much
[18:44:23] <methoddk> IgnisDiabolus: thats cool, i may end up using that
[18:44:40] <methoddk> still want to figure out why its working in safari but not ff
[18:52:22] <_Pepper> methoddk: you forgot the callback in your URL. http://jsfiddle.net/rk8UH/9/
[18:52:39] <methoddk> woah
[18:52:41] <methoddk> lol
[18:52:46] <methoddk> whats that do though
[18:53:01] <_Pepper> ?callback
[18:53:05] <bot-t> _Pepper, Callbacks Object - The jQuery.Callbacks() function, introduced in version 1.7, returns a multi-purpose object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. It supports adding, removing, firing, and disabling... http://api.jquery.com/category/callbacks-object/
[18:53:17] <_Pepper> lol, not that
[18:53:38] <methoddk> its got to have something to do with insta api
[18:53:49] <_Pepper> methoddk: callback=? is what allows for cross-domain scripting.
[18:53:55] <methoddk> ahh yeah
[18:54:03] <methoddk> that was my error in chrome
[18:56:18] <methoddk> thank you _Pepper haha i would've never thought of that
[18:57:16] <IgnisDiabolus> or use dataType: 'jsonp' :0
[18:57:52] <IgnisDiabolus> oh sorry. that's $.ajax() ;)
[18:58:01] <MACscr> how do i run some jquery code on page load or on click? I cant just create a normal js function to use outside of $(function () {});, correct? because i cant use any jquery functions outside that area. Is that right?
[19:00:50] <IgnisDiabolus> MACscr, correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't jQuery(funcion($){  /*code here*/ }); runs code inside once the document ends loading?
[19:01:10] <Eviltwin> Once the DOM is ready
[19:01:23] <IgnisDiabolus> oh right
[19:01:33] <MACscr> right, thats simple. But i need to run it on click as well. How do i do that without duplicating code?
[19:01:55] <IgnisDiabolus> then add a listener .click()
[19:02:03] <Eviltwin> Well one trick is to do $("#button").click(function() { ... }).click() inside there
[19:02:19] <Shai_Tan> I have some jquery-ui tabs. I wish to have a tab point to an external url, how do I do this?
[19:02:25] <Eviltwin> But it's a better practice to do function x() { ... } $("#button").click(x); x();
[19:02:29] <MACscr> Eviltwin: that example will only run on click
[19:02:31] <Shai_Tan> I need it to go to /logout
[19:02:45] <Eviltwin> MACscr: Read it again
[19:03:03] <MACscr> Eviltwin: i was commenting on your first example
[19:03:14] <Eviltwin> MACscr: Read it again
[19:03:34] <MACscr> $("#button").click(function()
[19:03:41] <MACscr> doesnt that imply it only runs on click?
[19:04:06] <Eviltwin> And take a look at the end of the line
[19:05:46] <MACscr> i still dont get it. You have a click() instead of a click()
[19:06:10] <Eviltwin> A click() instead of a click()?
[19:06:29] <IgnisDiabolus> MACscr, http://jsfiddle.net/k7Hjb/1/
[19:06:29] <MACscr> "Well one trick is to do $("#button").click(function() { ... }).click() inside there"
[19:06:35] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:06:40] <IgnisDiabolus> that is what he means
[19:11:36] <MACscr> lol, that example confuses the heck out of me. Ok, so i would think that lines 2-5 assign that alert to happen when #test is clicked, but I dont understand what line 7 does
[19:12:08] <Eviltwin> It causes a click event
[19:12:13] <Eviltwin> ?click @ MACscr
[19:12:14] <bot-t> MACscr, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[19:12:16] <Eviltwin> Read that
[19:12:18] <Eviltwin> The link
[19:13:08] <IgnisDiabolus> line 7, in simple terms, remotes or triggers a click event even without the user actually clicking the link
[19:14:04] <IgnisDiabolus> so once the DOM is ready, it triggers the click event, the click handler then listens to that click event and does what it is supposed to do. I don't know if the placement will have any effect but I've put the listener before the trigger
[19:14:16] <IgnisDiabolus> 2-5 = listener, 7 = trigger :)
[19:15:31] <MACscr> just seems odd to be able to run that trigger on page load when nothing is actually clicked. I get how it works now, just seems quite odd
[19:15:42] <Eviltwin> It's really not
[19:16:08] <Eviltwin> The ability to have (essentially) indistinguishable user- and programatically-generated events is one of the great features of jQuery
[19:16:16] <_Pepper> IgnisDiablous: to be a bit more purist to jQuery maybe using .trigger would be a easier sample.
[19:16:24] <_Pepper> ?trigger
[19:16:25] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[19:16:41] <_Pepper> agree with Eviltwin
[19:16:54] <IgnisDiabolus> _Pepper, don't confuse him farther... hahaha. but yeah. you're right.
[19:17:04] <_Pepper> lol. fair enough
[19:17:13] <MACscr> ok, so this style seems to make much more sense to me? function x() { ... } $("#button").click(x); x();
[19:17:21] <Eviltwin> Then use that style
[19:17:58] <MACscr> but i cant define a js function within $(function () { }); correct?
[19:18:04] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[19:18:07] <IgnisDiabolus> more LOCs :\
[19:18:08] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ MACscr
[19:18:08] <bot-t> MACscr, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[19:18:31] <Eviltwin> jQuery is JavaScript
[19:18:50] <Eviltwin> It's a set of tools written in JavaScript to make many things easier
[19:19:13] <MACscr> but when it tried to do that and then called it, it said it wasnt defined
[19:19:14] <MACscr> hmm
[19:19:28] <Eviltwin> Well that's probably an issue of scope
[19:19:34] <_Pepper> MACscr: scope also applies to all things Javascript as well
[19:19:50] <Eviltwin> He's probably just not aware of it
[19:19:52] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ MACscr
[19:19:53] <bot-t> MACscr, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[19:20:27] <IgnisDiabolus> MACscr, http://jsfiddle.net/k7Hjb/2/
[19:20:36] <IgnisDiabolus> and read the links
[19:21:12] <MACscr> IgnisDiabolus: oh i understand your example, but i wouldnt be able to use any jquery functions within ohHai(), correct?
[19:22:25] <Eviltwin> ..
[19:23:05] <Eviltwin> MACscr: Start reading that second link
[19:23:18] <Eviltwin> It will answer that question for you
[19:23:46] <IgnisDiabolus> MACscr, last example. before you ask another question. please read the articles in the links provided by master Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/k7Hjb/3/
[19:23:46] <MACscr> well i asked this question 15 minutes ago and its a simple yes or no answer
[19:24:05] <Eviltwin> That's because the answer is "depends"
[19:24:14] <Eviltwin> Which is explained thoroughly here: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[19:24:55] <_Pepper> MACscr: as Eviltwin is saying, I think it is wise to read the links we are botting you. There is some fundementals with Javascript that really will help you get off the ground and do some wonderful things with Javascript. Just grab a quick cup of java, and read the links. It is not an exhaustive read, and they are really geared to get you up and running quickly.
[19:25:07] <IgnisDiabolus> Eviltwin, it's recommended to put jquery stuff inside the jQuery(function($){}); though right?
[19:25:13] <Eviltwin> Note, he means java, not Java.
[19:25:27] <Eviltwin> IgnisDiabolus: Again, "it depends"
[19:26:16] <IgnisDiabolus> well, to avoid conflicts. well, if you use jQuery instead of $ signs, it will be defined once you load the jQuery library :)
[19:26:37] <Eviltwin> Again, "it depends"
[19:26:56] <MACscr> not really a useful response if you ask me
[19:27:27] <IgnisDiabolus> maybe i should read that also. i hate "it depends" answers and not expounding on that. i gather it would take a lot of time to explain. :3
[19:27:29] <Eviltwin> MACscr: You know what is a useful response? 123 pages of resources for you to answer all of these questions for yourself
[19:27:44] <Eviltwin> And more than just "yes" or "no" they explain in detail the reasons
[19:28:04] <keir> can you pass a function arguments if they are not set when the function is created?
[19:28:18] <MACscr> Eviltwin: well IgnisDiabolus seemed to agree me with me a bit on the "it depends
[19:28:20] <Eviltwin> keir: Have you programmed before?
[19:28:25] <MACscr> answer
[19:28:28] <keir> not really :P
[19:28:36] <keir> trying to learn though!
[19:28:36] <Eviltwin> MACscr: The answer is neither universally yes nor universally no
[19:28:50] <Eviltwin> MACscr: But if it makes you feel better, you can flip a coin and pick one.
[19:28:55] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ keir
[19:28:56] <bot-t> keir, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[19:29:09] <_Pepper> lol
[19:29:13] <Eviltwin> keir: Start with the first link, picking the beginner resource that works best for you
[19:29:19] <MACscr> i try to stick with proper coding practices whenever possible. Just because something works, doesnt make it right
[19:29:24] <Eviltwin> Then once you've worked through that, the intermediate, and so on
[19:29:36] <Eviltwin> Once you understand at least intermediate JavaScript, move on to the second link
[19:29:40] <Eviltwin> And learn more about jQuery
[19:31:28] <IgnisDiabolus> well, it seems that the answer to my question isn't "it depends" as stated here http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-3
[19:31:42] <_Pepper> MACscr: that is good way to approach it, but keep in my that half of the "proper coding practices" are contextual in nature in programming languages so knowing when and where to apply them just as valuable. So the more we know as programmers about the language we develop in, the easier it is to adopt and implement correctly.
[19:32:22] <Eviltwin> IgnisDiabolus: That doesn't say you can't put any jQuery code outside the jQuery(function($){...})
[19:32:32] <Eviltwin> And there are sometimes reasons to do that
[19:33:13] <Eviltwin> I would recommend using a (function($){...})(jQuery); wrapper though if you're worried about conflicts
[19:33:15] <IgnisDiabolus> well, you're right now that i think about it. if i have a function that would do simple mathematical equations. I can put it outside
[19:33:17] <Eviltwin> Notice there is a difference
[19:33:29] <IgnisDiabolus> and all the event handling will be inside
[19:33:30] <Eviltwin> You can put functions that use jQuery outside
[19:33:41] <Eviltwin> No reason you can't
[19:34:20] <trewq> I have a form element like this: <p><label for="id_title">Title:</label> <input id="id_title" type="text" name="title" maxlength="255" /> <span class="helptext">What is the name of the event?</span></p>     I want to make the helptext popup when someone hover over that field. How would I do this using qtip2?
[19:34:29] <IgnisDiabolus> yes. yes. i guess you are right. so, that is expounding. which explained a lot. some people like me aren't good readers. sorry :) that may be the reason why IRC communities like this are present
[19:34:36] <trewq> or is there a better popup to use?
[19:35:02] <Eviltwin> trewq: If qtip2 suits your needs, use qtip2
[19:35:20] <M4d3L> hi anyone can tell me how to prevent script to run 2 time $.noConflict();?
[19:36:04] <trewq> I can create a popup easily but would like to use the qtip2 and write a single function that will takecare of all the popup without me having to create a seperate function
[19:36:20] <Eviltwin> IgnisDiabolus: One of the concerns with putting everything inside a jQuery(function($){...}) is that nothing inside there can be directly referenced from outside
[19:36:35] <Eviltwin> Which means if you have a lot of cross-dependencies, they all need to be in one giant jQuery(function($){...})
[19:36:47] <Eviltwin> Which means you can't separate into files and modules and take advantage of caching
[19:36:49] <_Pepper> trewq: qtip2 has some good api docs, and very robust in it's context generation. Did you check the api?
[19:36:52] <keir> so you can is the answer I was looking for :P
[19:37:11] <IgnisDiabolus> awesome. now that you mentioned it. i feel like an idiot now.
[19:37:19] <_Pepper> keir: yep
[19:37:24] <Eviltwin> Additionally, jQuery(function($){...}) won't run that code until the DOM is ready but depending on how you bind, you can end up with code running in an unexpected order
[19:38:04] <Eviltwin> Which is why I don't think it's a good idea to put everything inside a jQuery(function($){...})
[19:38:08] <Eviltwin> Even if it does use jQuery
[19:38:28] <Eviltwin> It's just generally not a good idea to try to use selectors or manipulate the <body> before the DOM is ready
[19:38:33] <_Pepper> M4d3l: can you jsfiddle a sample, that is a bit hard to debug just from what you are saying since there can be various reason a script get re-excuted.
[19:38:41] <IgnisDiabolus> right
[19:38:52] <keir> thanks
[19:39:08] <trewq> _Pepper: I did look at the api, but did not find what I need easily
[19:39:15] <IgnisDiabolus> Eviltwin, thanks for explaining. I learned a lot.
[19:39:45] <keir> one other thing, if i was doing a for loop to declare some variables, and the variable name was $foo+i would that create a new variable on each iteration
[19:39:51] <keir> i.e foo1 foo2 foo3 etc?
[19:40:11] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[19:40:12] <_Pepper> Eviltwin: unless you put the script at the bottom of the body tag. That is what I am using since I want to take advantage of asychronous loading and executing.
[19:40:16] <Eviltwin> You can't really do that
[19:40:17] <IgnisDiabolus> keir, no.
[19:40:30] <trewq> I am not a js guy and I know this can be done, but not sure how to use the helptext to showup without having to write a seperate function for all the elements
[19:40:38] <IgnisDiabolus> if you want something like that. use arrays
[19:40:43] <Eviltwin> _Pepper: It depends on what the browser decides to do
[19:41:11] <Eviltwin> _Pepper: If you put them at the bottom but don't use a .ready, you might end up doing your work before the initial draw is complete
[19:41:21] <Eviltwin> Meaning you could have FOUC
[19:41:38] <Eviltwin> It really depends on the browser
[19:41:43] <Eviltwin> The best practice is to use both
[19:41:49] <Eviltwin> Put scripts at the bottom and use .ready
[19:42:11] <Eviltwin> That way you speed up loading but still have the promise that your code won't run until after the initial draw is complete
[19:42:27] <IgnisDiabolus> i like how conditionals are a core part of programming. even with how everything is done. there are a lot of if and else going on. haha
[19:42:43] <_Pepper> Eviltwin: been our tests on a good family of browser ( ie6+, chrome, FF, safari, and linux variants ) that if the script is executed at the bottom of the body tag, it has access to all the HTML above it. Keep in mind that we just wanted access to the HTML , and we we wanted to beat the initial draw at times.
[19:43:06] <IgnisDiabolus> if Eviltwin, was programming his explanation, there would be a lot of if and else and switch cases :3
[19:43:31] <M4d3L> to set an attribut like href to <a> is a.set()?
[19:43:51] <trewq> do I need to write a for loop that goes through all the elements in a form?
[19:43:54] <_Pepper> ?attr @ M4d3l
[19:43:54] <bot-t> M4d3l, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[19:44:18] <Eviltwin> _Pepper: Well browsers promise the DOM will be ready at the DOMContentLoaded event, nothing more
[19:44:23] <M4d3L> ty
[19:44:41] <keir> so is there no way to add the index of the iteration to the variable name to create distinct variables when running a for loop?
[19:44:57] <Eviltwin> IgnisDiabolus: I prefer not to lie, given the option
[19:45:09] <Eviltwin> keir: There's just no good reason to
[19:45:11] <IgnisDiabolus> Eviltwin, and i like it
[19:45:17] <IgnisDiabolus> keir, look at arrays please
[19:45:22] <Eviltwin> keir: If you're trying to do that, you're doing something horribly wrong
[19:45:56] <Eviltwin> keir: JavaScript is not a good first language to learn
[19:46:07] <IgnisDiabolus> Eviltwin, is C ok? :3
[19:46:18] <Eviltwin> C is better because at least you need some understanding of memory
[19:46:27] <Eviltwin> In order to do C well
[19:46:40] <IgnisDiabolus> keir, learn C first then.
[19:49:26] * _unary Computer has gone to sleep.
[19:49:50] <_Pepper> Eviltwin: yes but DOMContentLoaded is not really standardized at times from browser to browser, some trigger after .load, some report back after DOM is parsed, other have shown to be after head elements ( styles are loaded, etc ) in addition to DOM. It was a bit of a toss up. I just needed acces to HTML and manipulate DOM elements. I am still trying to standardize the widget transformations, but so far so good.
[19:50:24] <Eviltwin> _unary: You have made no contributions here other than messages about how you're no longer here
[19:51:33] <systemfault> I wouldn't be able to tell what is a good "first language" :/
[19:51:56] <Eviltwin> I ususally tell people C or Python
[19:52:14] <Eviltwin> C gives you the important notion of how everything actually works
[19:52:26] <systemfault> I started with C++ and I don't think it was a great idea.
[19:52:39] <methoddk> i would start with python or ruby
[19:52:41] <Eviltwin> Python lets you learn programming and objects without a lot of syntax clutter
[19:52:42] <_Pepper> <-- Perl then Python
[19:52:42] <systemfault> C has the same problem of "UB"
[19:52:57] <methoddk> you don't need to know C anymore
[19:53:01] <systemfault> Python could be a good idea.
[19:53:06] <IgnisDiabolus> C :3
[19:53:08] <methoddk> unless you want to make iOS apps
[19:53:08] <systemfault> methoddk: Depends on what you want to do.
[19:53:10] <Eviltwin> I'd say the worst things is probably Java or JavaScript
[19:53:29] <systemfault> Eviltwin: I don't know better than Java to learn OOP.. seriously.
[19:53:31] <Eviltwin> Java because when you're starting, you're just doing functional programming
[19:53:39] <_Pepper> there is always smalltalk if you really want an indepth, but python was a great language and agree a good first one to pickup since it gives really good fundementals
[19:53:45] <methoddk> perl was my first lang
[19:53:45] <Eviltwin> But you need to fit around Java's design patterns
[19:53:51] <IgnisDiabolus> systemfault, java is great with oop. i agree
[19:53:52] <systemfault> Eviltwin: But I think that javascript is a very very bad first language.
[19:54:01] <Eviltwin> So you need to blindly type public class MyCode { public static void main(String[] args) { ... } }
[19:54:06] <Eviltwin> Just to be able to write code
[19:54:18] <IgnisDiabolus> please, no language war in jquery. let's agree that js isn't a good starting language
[19:54:35] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Do you need to blindly write #include <stdio.h> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) ?
[19:54:36] <Eviltwin> The amount of time it would take to explain why each of those keywords is there before knowing how to programming would probably turn every new programmer away
[19:55:01] <Eviltwin> Well for one thing, you don't need to include the int argc, char *argv[]
[19:55:05] <Eviltwin> If you don't care about the arguments
[19:55:14] <Eviltwin> Which is a good way to start IMO
[19:55:23] <saddishwasher> evening
[19:55:28] <IgnisDiabolus> public static void main whatever?
[19:55:55] <Eviltwin> But that's part of the reason I argue for Python
[19:56:04] <Eviltwin> You don't need any clutter to program
[19:56:05] <_Pepper> second that
[19:56:05] <methoddk> i have a friend in a C++ class in uni, taught on a chalkboard, no comps
[19:56:10] <methoddk> penning code
[19:56:21] <Eviltwin> And you have the REPL interpreter
[19:56:22] <systemfault> Just thinking that java is a good language to learn OOP.. not necessarily a good "first language"
[19:56:23] <IgnisDiabolus> is python that language that only needs indentation for code blocks?
[19:56:24] <Eviltwin> So you can really play with it
[19:56:32] <IgnisDiabolus> i mean no braces?
[19:56:33] <_Pepper> yes
[19:56:34] <systemfault> Eviltwin: I think I agree with you for python
[19:56:35] <methoddk> yup
[19:56:57] <IgnisDiabolus> oh god... i'm a bit of OC and I need my braces. figured it's a great language tho
[19:56:57] <Eviltwin> systemfault: Java is a language of strict OOP
[19:57:17] <Eviltwin> (Where everything is virtual for you C++ folk)
[19:57:19] <systemfault> Eviltwin: Yeah, that's why it's good to teach strict OOP :P
[19:57:30] <Eviltwin> Well yes and no
[19:57:40] <IgnisDiabolus> why no :\
[19:57:41] <saddishwasher> I def advocate for python! the easiest language to learn IMO
[19:57:55] <Eviltwin> I mean it's nice to have training wheels
[19:57:57] <saddishwasher> and it can do soooo many things, in most cases better than all the others
[19:58:35] <Eviltwin> But I find that Java has a lot of noise that is there to simplify some overhead
[19:58:41] <_Pepper> hmmm. Eviltwin, not sure I would agree that Java is strict OOP. Java is not pure object oriented programming language its because it doesnot support multiple inheritance.
[19:58:58] <systemfault> _Pepper: How is that related?
[19:59:03] <Eviltwin> _Pepper: Multiple inheritance is kind of an ill-defined concept
[19:59:17] <_Pepper> but completly agree that it is a good training wheel language
[19:59:29] <systemfault> Saying that java isn't a pure OO language because it has primitive types is already a better answer..
[19:59:51] <coldhead> if all your parents and grandparents die in a horrible train wreck: that's multiple inheritance for you
[20:00:06] <systemfault> But MI? MI is always bad...
[20:00:13] <IgnisDiabolus> coldhead, nah... i'm not included in their will
[20:00:21] <systemfault> MI done right is... "traits"
[20:00:27] <Eviltwin> Yeah, especially since C++ let you have a DAG of inheritance
[20:00:47] <Eviltwin> Which meant B and C could both extend A and D could inherit B and C
[20:00:48] <_Pepper> lol, but from a purist OOP prespective it does not qualify, does not mean that it is worse thou.
[20:00:58] <systemfault> Eviltwin: The iostream have that problem
[20:00:59] <Eviltwin> At which point there becomes the question of whether there should be one or two instances of A
[20:01:29] <systemfault> Eviltwin: ostream and istream derive from ios... and iostream derives from ostream and istream... diamond inheritance FTL
[20:01:48] <keirlav87> does anyone mind if i explain my problem in alittle more detail even though its actually more of a php problem but it may make alittle more sense as to what im trying to achieve and make me look ( I hope! )  alittle less stupid :P
[20:02:00] <Eviltwin> keirlav87: If it's a PHP problem, see #php
[20:02:03] <Eviltwin> Or is it ##php
[20:02:05] <Eviltwin> I can never remember
[20:02:11] <systemfault> ##Hell
[20:02:11] <keirlav87> i've tried in there but its dead
[20:02:12] <systemfault> ;)
[20:02:12] <IgnisDiabolus> Eviltwin, it redirects to ##php
[20:02:31] <_Pepper> systemfault: lol
[20:02:34] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I consider Java a strict language
[20:02:35] <IgnisDiabolus> so whichever :)
[20:02:49] <Eviltwin> Which is why I consider it training wheels
[20:02:51] <_Pepper> Eviltwin: never argued that an agree.
[20:02:57] <Eviltwin> More things get caught at compile time instead of runtime
[20:03:05] <MACscr> grr, sure wish jsfiddle had line numbers
[20:03:05] <Eviltwin> But I think eventually you need to move on
[20:03:06] <keirlav87> would anyone mind, or will I get shouted at for being off topic :p
[20:03:18] <Eviltwin> keirlav87: We're not PHP fans here, most of us
[20:03:21] <coldhead> where is the promised land you'd have us move to, Eviltwin
[20:03:46] <Eviltwin> coldhead: I think Python and Ruby are better
[20:03:47] <Eviltwin> Well
[20:03:53] <Eviltwin> I haven't done much Ruby
[20:03:58] <coldhead> keirlav87: it's not so much being off topic as it is "talking about horrible php"
[20:03:58] <Eviltwin> But the theory of Ruby at least
[20:04:02] <_Pepper> keirlav87: pm me please, I will see if I can help. I will let Evil, Cold and systemfault keep the OOP alive
[20:04:04] <IgnisDiabolus> you mean ruby on rails :3
[20:04:12] <coldhead> bless you _Pepper
[20:04:13] <Eviltwin> There's just a lot more flexibility
[20:04:19] <systemfault> :)
[20:04:27] <keirlav87> yeah, bless you _pepper!
[20:04:41] <Eviltwin> I think things like closure should be a part of every high-level programming language
[20:04:50] <IgnisDiabolus> i heard ruby is ugly without rails
[20:04:58] <IgnisDiabolus> i haven't tried it yet though
[20:05:11] <Eviltwin> And generators too
[20:05:21] <Eviltwin> But not many languages have that in their current versions yet
[20:05:37] <MACscr> i personally dont like languages that i have to compile. I prefer to be able to save and run
[20:05:52] <Eviltwin> That's not really a good argument for or against a language IMO
[20:05:54] <MACscr> but im not really a programmer, more of a consultant
[20:06:02] <IgnisDiabolus> i like french language
[20:06:49] <Eviltwin> On a fundamental level, I think a programming language shouldn't require much more verbiage than my own thought process
[20:07:19] <Eviltwin> I want to be able to write code as fast as I think
[20:07:30] <systemfault> Hmm...
[20:07:31] <Eviltwin> Writing the actual characters, not tab completing keywords
[20:07:40] <Eviltwin> Not starting with templates
[20:07:41] <IgnisDiabolus> being english not my primary language, i have a bit of a hard time programming :)
[20:07:51] <systemfault> Some days.. thinking is 80% of my time.
[20:08:26] <Eviltwin> I'm saying that ideally thought -> code should be as small as possible
[20:08:37] <IgnisDiabolus> 50% thinking, 40% research, 10% actually writing code
[20:08:45] <Eviltwin> I have days where I write no code, only thinking about solving problems
[20:09:06] <Eviltwin> But when presented a problem, I like to be able to convey the solution to a compter as quickly as possible
[20:09:17] <systemfault> That was a way to say... that even a language as verbose as java is usually not a problem.
[20:09:50] <Eviltwin> But something like closures and generators
[20:09:56] <Eviltwin> And callbacks
[20:10:15] <systemfault> I love these :D
[20:10:43] <Eviltwin> All three of those are valuable
[20:10:52] <systemfault> Wish javascript would have generators..
[20:10:59] <Eviltwin> Yes, that would help complete it for me
[20:11:07] <Eviltwin> You can sometimes invert the pattern
[20:11:11] <Eviltwin> Using a chain of callbacks instead
[20:11:26] <Eviltwin> But that only really works if you were planning to iterate over all of the items right away
[20:11:42] <systemfault> Firefox already has them.. but we cannot use them in our everyday tasks..
[20:12:10] <Eviltwin> My other problem is reading code
[20:12:20] <Eviltwin> Which is why my whitespacing differs from most
[20:12:32] <Eviltwin> I can't stand it if things look too spaced out to me
[20:12:36] <systemfault> How is it different?
[20:12:44] <systemfault> You use 16 spaces indentation? :P
[20:12:46] <Eviltwin> Things are generally a lot more compact
[20:12:53] <Eviltwin> Not just tabbing
[20:12:57] <Eviltwin> But like where you break lines
[20:12:59] <Eviltwin> How much happens in one line
[20:13:14] <systemfault> Ahh, I see
[20:14:21] <Eviltwin> To me it's all about the flow of information
[20:14:46] <Eviltwin> Sometimes three consecutive function calls are all part of the same idea to me
[20:14:57] <Eviltwin> The same item on the list of "tasks"
[20:15:09] <Eviltwin> So I'm more likely to pack them tighter
[20:15:23] <systemfault> I'm the total opposite :/
[20:15:23] <IgnisDiabolus> do you have 2 spaces for indents like me?
[20:15:33] <Eviltwin> I basically like to be able to read my code at a constant number of lines / second
[20:15:39] <Eviltwin> And never feel bored or overwhelmed
[20:16:07] <Eviltwin> And not have to dig through a bunch of clutter to get at what's actually happening
[20:16:12] <systemfault> I like "air" in my code, I use more lines than most to better separate the content of my functions.
[20:16:34] <systemfault> If everything is too packed.. it's difficult for me.
[20:16:45] <Eviltwin> Right, so you write code so that it's at your pace
[20:17:17] <Eviltwin> If you were to replace every \n with \n\n\n
[20:17:20] <Eviltwin> It would probably feel weird
[20:17:44] <Eviltwin> Be hard to have both the wide-angle view and the line view
[20:17:56] <Eviltwin> And it's always a balance of the two IMO
[20:18:01] <systemfault> I would never do that.. but for example, I leave a blank like between my variable declarations and the code
[20:18:21] <Eviltwin> You need to be able to understand the single piece on its own and how it fits into the context, the program as a whole
[20:18:23] <systemfault> I also do it after a for/while
[20:18:36] <Eviltwin> So I space my program that way
[20:18:56] <Eviltwin> Where a page full is just enough context and the lines don't do too much at once
[20:21:09] <Eviltwin> But just the other day I wanted to write code to go through every permutation of some set of items under a few restructions
[20:21:12] <Eviltwin> In Java
[20:21:27] <Eviltwin> And I wanted to be able to iterate, not just build a bigass list or immediately call some function with it
[20:21:32] <Eviltwin> So I wanted to use a generator
[20:22:12] <Eviltwin> But because Java doesn't have generators
[20:22:18] <systemfault> Right :/
[20:22:48] <Eviltwin> So I had to slow down my thought process because I had to implement something that would be trivial with generators without generators
[20:23:06] <Eviltwin> And had to put in lots of comments and whatnot
[20:23:49] <Eviltwin> The file would probably have been a tenth the length if I had access to generators
[20:24:02] <Eviltwin> And thus would be a lot more readable both to me and anyone else
[20:24:12] <Eviltwin> So that's my philosophy
[20:24:20] <Eviltwin> And it looks like I've procrastinated enough
[20:25:32] <keirlav87> thank you _pepper you've been a massive help :)
[20:25:53] <_Pepper> no problem keirlav87. Glad we could help
[20:29:06] <_Pepper> Ok, everyone where were we, did we all agree that Java rocks, and JS is not a language for the meek? :P
[20:29:17] <Hypahspeed> is there a good way to assign an onLoad() equivalent to an <img> with jquery ?
[20:29:34] * spiffie snorts
[20:29:34] <_Pepper> ?load @ Hyphaspeed
[20:29:35] <bot-t> Hyphaspeed, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[20:30:07] <Hypahspeed> look at that spiffie, somebody else answered the easiest question asked all day while you were busy doing cocaine
[20:30:18] <atula> I am trying to do something like this in my Manager: defining a function that if I pass in an object of that type, I return the "next" object according to some logic... should I be using isinstance(obj, ModelObject) to make sure that it's the right object?
[20:32:40] <_Pepper> atula: not sure I understand the question? are you trying to findout what is being passed through a function?
[20:33:02] <atula> yes, _Pepper just being careful
[20:33:10] <_Pepper> if so there are some helper utilities in jQuery that can assist.
[20:33:24] <_Pepper> ?utilities @ atula
[20:33:25] <bot-t> atula, Docs: Utilities - To see if there are elements in your current jQuery object, check . length . For example: if ($('.myclass').length){ http://api.jquery.com/category/Utilities/
[20:33:29] <atula> oopsie... I thought this was #django
[20:33:30] <atula> nvm
[20:33:37] <atula> _Pepper: wrong window
[20:33:42] <Eviltwin> atula: obj instance of ModelObject
[20:33:44] <Eviltwin> instanceof*
[20:33:44] <_Pepper> lol, though so.
[20:33:59] <atula> I think I'll just do the try/catch, Eviltwin
[20:34:03] <_Pepper> thought that was python
[20:34:05] <coldhead> lol
[20:34:16] <Eviltwin> Uh...that's not a particularly good solution
[20:34:17] <atula> o.O
[20:34:17] <Eviltwin> The try/catch
[20:34:31] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do exactly?
[20:34:33] <Eviltwin> Can you make a demo?
[20:34:37] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ atula
[20:34:37] <bot-t> atula, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:34:55] <_Pepper> lol, Eviltwin not sure he can in jsfiddle.
[20:34:56] <atula> Eviltwin: well, I got objects... I want to do next/previous with that object/id
[20:34:58] <atula> -_-
[20:35:05] <atula> nvm... wrong channel like I said
[20:35:39] <Eviltwin> Oh, so this isn't a JavaScript question?
[20:35:41] <_Pepper> django ftw in python web :)
[20:35:53] <_Pepper> no Eviltwin it was a django question
[20:35:56] <Eviltwin> Hah
[20:36:02] <_Pepper> he was in the wrong window
[20:36:18] <Eviltwin> Then, yes, proceed on to the right window
[20:36:38] <atula> :)
[20:36:47] <atula> you guys are cute though... very nice.
[20:36:50] <atula> keep up the good work
[20:36:59] <coldhead> atula is one of the great old ones of #jQuery
[20:37:01] <Eviltwin> Not sure we'd go with "cute"
[20:37:05] <Eviltwin> "attractive" maybe
[20:37:05] <_Pepper> lol thanks atula
[20:37:09] <_Pepper> rofl!!
[20:37:37] <atula> pfftt! we just lost the Superbowl... that's as much as you're going to get from me tonight :)
[20:37:58] <_Pepper> rofl!
[20:39:10] <coldhead> sorry for your loss atula
[20:39:11] <shmup> atula the hunk
[20:39:46] <coldhead> you sure are away, aknewhope
[20:40:15] <atula> honestly... most of the days, I couldn't care less about the common man's bread and circus entertainment... but the streets were EMPTIED in Boston... so I told myself: "shoot, maybe I ought to stop coding for a bit and watch the game like I was supposed to"
[20:40:22] <atula> but boy... was I wrong to do so...
[20:40:24] <atula> only sadness
[20:40:40] <spiffie> I went grocery shopping. no lines!
[20:40:45] <atula> seriously!
[20:41:47] <atula> watched it with my wife, both of us rarely watch football. she commented: "okay, I think I got this. its a game where one guy has the ball and others try to distract the other team so he can throw it"
[20:41:50] <atula> hehe... oh wife
[20:43:01] <spiffie> seems plausible, but then I imagine teams might repalce linebackers with cheerleaders
[20:43:18] <_Pepper> nice, simple yet effective. Give the wife a kiss, she deserves that much for trying, mine just scoffs and complains that my buddies are here drinking all our beer!
[20:43:35] <spiffie> they'll make more beer!
[20:43:43] <spiffie> it's a renewable resource
[20:44:00] <atula> spiffie: interesting... but I think you might be talking about this: http://www.lflus.com/lbviii/
[20:44:02] <_Pepper> Ahmen!
[20:44:45] <coldhead> >: |
[20:45:06] <Jake55> Anyone looking for a freelance javascript/jquery dev? :)
[20:45:43] <_Pepper> Jake55: you realize that you are in a chat group where more of us are probably just that :P
[20:46:01] <_Pepper> or working towards that :P
[20:47:00] <spiffie> what's the opposite of freelance? enslaved? I am an enslaved javascript/jquery developer
[20:47:03] <Jake55> _Pepper, naahh not most of us, maybe  tenth
[20:47:19] <coldhead> Jake55: http://jobs.jsninja.com/a/jbb/find-jobs
[20:48:24] <_Pepper> Jake55: I would think higher, many may not be specialized in javascript/jQuery but are capable and would accept jobs requests those skills.
[20:48:36] <_Pepper> *requesting
[20:54:45] <_Pepper> Anyone ever use grunt for thier jQuery plugins to build?
[20:56:13] <ryanseddon> it has it's own channel #grunt
[20:57:07] <aqeel> hi room
[20:57:23] <aqeel> anyone in here who have worked with interfaces with jquery
[20:57:41] <aqeel> Ui that will be
[20:58:43] <_Pepper> I know ryanseddon, just wondering about people experience with it. I am going to be writing a few directives for the project since it still in it's infancy, but wanted to get some feedback since I am rather new to it.
[20:59:18] <_Pepper> aqeel: what is your question?
[20:59:19] <aqeel> i would like to come up with this interface where you controll the scrolling with keyboard and mouse....also the speed of scrolling can be done by user....faster or slower....and stop when mouse over page.....also these funtions are to be performed with keyboard....
[21:00:11] <aqeel> sey press d will scroll down press u will scroll up and h will hold
[21:00:38] <aqeel> and a toggle between mouse and keyboard usage....
[21:00:45] <aqeel> can this be done...?
[21:02:39] <_Pepper> aqeel: Jquery can bind keyboard event to almost anything. There are some plugins that have started to experiment with this https://github.com/Iterar/Keyboard-Scroll-jQuery-Plugin
[21:02:58] <_Pepper> not sure if they have gone the mile you are needed, but probably a good place to start
[21:03:06] <_Pepper> *needing
[21:04:41] <aqeel> thanaks and looking into it.....so it is possible and how about mouse...
[21:07:28] <_Pepper> aqeel: the mouse has a wheel that is usally mapped for scrolling, not sure what you asking about the mouse, but there is a mousewheel plugin that allows you to easily bind mousewheel actions to the same logic as your keyboard control. https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel
[21:08:41] <_Pepper> aqeel: so putting those two together should in essence give you a good foundation to program what logic you were looking for. The rest is up to you. Makes sense?
[21:10:22] <aqeel> ok for mouse this is the scenario.....page loads and starts scrolling itself onload by default....when mouseover the page scrolling stops.....and there is a scrolling controll (not system default) manuallly made....and have this properties...mouse over scroll up/down, click locks scroll up/down but when mouse out of scrolling up...starts to scroll down from that moment wjhere it was left out at scroll up
[21:11:54] <aqeel> say implimenting my own functions rather than default
[21:12:24] <aqeel> and i would like to like clear all default funtions and load mine and work with mine properties...
[21:13:32] <aqeel> why i am saying is this...the window will have only monitor hight and width and no scroll bar will appear but content loaded into div is acrollable as it is longer than monitor height
[21:14:37] <_Pepper> aqeel: ok that will take a few bindings and so there will be some work on your part. For the most part there event handlers and listeners in jQuery to map all the actions you require. So in short, it appears to be possible. Mind you I have never went to that many overrides of default behaviours since I generally do not like to play to much with user's behaviours when it comes to controls.
[21:14:43] * spiffie is having marquee flashbacks
[21:15:53] <_Pepper> users expected ( default ) behaviours. Since it usually generates confusion for the user unless it is really well documented and visible.
[21:16:16] <aqeel> well it will be and u will like it....
[21:16:42] <_Pepper> lol, confidence is always a good sign in development
[21:17:54] <aqeel> ;)
[21:18:26] <aqeel> well interface is simple and very pleasant...
[21:19:05] <_Pepper> ok, gang I am outy. I have to get intimate with ben's code for grunt to see if I can create the directives I need finish my build system for my jQuery plugin. As per usual is has been a blast.
[21:19:36] <aqeel> cu...have nice coding day
[21:19:49] <_Pepper> aqeel: KISS rules! good luck! and thanks
[21:20:49] <yog> Hey... hello Guys
[21:21:08] <methoddk> anyone know how to pull tweet text from api?
[21:21:25] <methoddk> i can get the request from API but can't parse it right
[21:28:40] <shmup> http://pastie.org/3325637
[21:28:55] <shmup> can someone explain how that works, the part within the function
[21:29:10] <shmup> $(msg).hide() what is going on here?
[21:30:19] <Eviltwin> I suppose they want the content to be invisible when it's appended
[21:30:35] <Eviltwin> But looks like they did it the wrong way
[21:35:52] <shmup> actually you're right, and tyeh did it the right way
[21:35:54] <shmup> it makes sense now
[21:36:12] <shmup> i need to figure out how to append to the end of a table, though. well at tbody:last
[21:36:25] <shmup> with (msg).append, just like that. the example above is for a list
[21:36:29] <someprimetime> $(msg)  is not the right way to do it
[21:37:09] <someprimetime> what is msg first of all
[21:37:09] <someprimetime> and i've always see hide().fadeIn()
[21:37:09] <someprimetime> chained together
[21:37:09] <someprimetime> i'd append first and then hide/fadeIn
[21:37:21] <shmup> well, for ME the message is....

[21:41:04] <shmup> i lied, i didn't get it working. i'll stop spamming, though~
[21:43:49] <someprimetime> why do people keep saying smh?
[21:43:57] <someprimetime> i don't get it
[21:44:11] <shmup> i'm sure if you knew the acronym for years you wouldn't have a problem with it
[21:44:21] <shmup> or are you saying you don't know what it means
[21:44:32] <someprimetime> i don't know what the hell it means
[21:44:37] <someprimetime> and i've been on the internet for a long time
[21:44:39] <shmup> sigh, shaking my head
[21:44:46] <shmup> lol jk~
[21:44:57] <someprimetime> that's just as bad as (:
[21:45:38] <shmup> mfw people compare acronyms to smilies
[21:45:43] <shmup> (i really hate mfw, my friend says it a lot)
[21:45:58] <Jake55> wats mfw stand for?
[21:46:50] <shmup> my face when. i hate it.
[21:47:31] <someprimetime> out of curiosity, shmup how old are you?
[21:47:31] <Jake55> its retarded
[21:47:35] <shmup> 27
[21:47:44] <gg> O:-)
[21:47:48] <Jake55> yoru old
[21:47:50] <Jake55> your ancient

[21:49:37] <Jake55> i am l33t
[21:50:00] <shmup> pretty awesome that you're coding at 14. i started at your age but was only learning html.
[21:50:01] <spiffie> hear me roar
[21:50:19] <Jake55> i kid, i'm 20
[21:50:25] <Jake55> i started coding when i was 10 :D
[21:50:44] <Jake55> vb 6.0
[21:50:50] <Jake55> good times
[21:50:53] <shmup> my dad got our first computer when i was 10, in '95, but i don't think i even knew what html was until '98
[21:51:07] <shmup> i wish someone introduced programming to me when i was 10
[21:51:25] <shmup> s/10/11
[21:51:50] <atplv> can some of you experienced programmers help me with an issue I have been having
[21:52:01] <Jake55> When i was 10 i was taking regular school. programming, english (outside school) and english pronunciation (outside school) :D
[21:52:08] <Jake55> i got home at like 7pm :p
[21:52:25] <muhoo> i teach programming to 3rd-8th graders
[21:52:27] <muhoo> they love it
[21:52:35] <Jake55> muhoo, what language?
[21:52:37] <shmup> what language does your school use?
[21:52:45] <muhoo> for 3rd-7th, scratch.mit.edu
[21:52:49] <shmup> i wonder, does it start with alice?
[21:52:50] <shmup> ah
[21:52:52] <shmup> thank goodness
[21:52:55] <Jake55> haha i was just about to ask that
[21:52:59] <muhoo> for 7th-8th..... javascript :-P
[21:53:06] <gg> !!!
[21:53:28] <shmup> thats really awesome that 3rd graders get opportunities like that in school now.
[21:53:39] <muhoo> the js is an experiment. first few weeks into it.
[21:53:52] <shmup> was the board toying with any other possible languages for those grades?
[21:53:53] <Jake55> muhoo, you guys use a textbook for JS?
[21:53:56] <muhoo> some of the kids are scary good.
[21:54:05] <muhoo> Jake55: i'd love one. right now i'm just making shit up.
[21:54:30] <muhoo> i got them doing a websockets chat app last week. html5 canvas animation the couple weeks before.
[21:54:38] <muhoo> they liked the chat app a lot.
[21:54:38] <Jake55> :O
[21:54:46] <Jake55> that is AWESOME
[21:54:53] <muhoo> it was like 50 lines of code. not hard.
[21:54:55] <Jake55> i wish our school had teachers like you
[21:55:06] <Jake55> i used to correct/annoy my teachers
[21:55:11] <muhoo> i'm not a teacher. i'm a parent quasi-volunteer.
[21:55:22] <Jake55> i want to do somethign like that right after college
[21:55:31] <Jake55> not for the $$ but for the fun
[21:55:32] <muhoo> we get paid for this stuff, but it's dirt. we're doing it just because we want our kids to have fun after school.
[21:56:07] <muhoo> definitely, the world needs people to teach this stuff.
[21:56:21] <muhoo> actually, there's a HUGE demand right this minute for teachers who know technology
[21:56:39] <Jake55> i had cmd open and  i typed "tree" into it an my "computer science" teacher was freeking out!!! thinking i was hakcing into something :p
[21:56:40] <muhoo> in the usa anyway
[21:56:54] <muhoo> hahahaha
[21:56:55] <Jake55> tahts how bad things were at my school
[21:57:01] <muhoo> oh, i have the kids using linux
[21:57:11] <yog> hi
[21:57:12] <Jake55> two of my friends got suspended because they had TOR on theri flash drives <_<
[21:57:21] <Jake55> muhoo, you are my hero :D
[21:57:27] <muhoo> mint, specifically. it was easier to boot the shitty lab computers off of mint than to try to install ff10, notepad++, firebug, etc. on XP
[21:57:28] <shmup> what distro? any of them actually well versed in linux for their age?
[21:58:02] <Jake55> muhoo, i suppose this is a private school? public schools aren't very techinically apt
[21:58:04] <muhoo> they are kind of clueless with linux. but they like it, they're just stumbling around a bit in it. that's expected.
[21:58:23] <muhoo> no, this is a public school, but one with tons of parent volunteers. it started as an alternative school in the 70s
[21:58:31] <Jake55> ahh
[21:58:35] <muhoo> and it still maintains some of that hippie tradition
[21:58:42] <Jake55> that is awesome
[21:58:50] <muhoo> parents are required to volunteer 90 hours a year
[21:59:06] <muhoo> it's a great setup.
[21:59:24] <muhoo> i got some kids who produce amazing stuff. it is a great joy to watch them.
[21:59:26] <shmup> interesting. i like that model.
[21:59:45] <Jake55> too bad most americans would point and yell communist!!!!!!!!!!
[21:59:56] <muhoo> i am a proud socialist :-P
[22:00:30] <Jake55> pure socialism sucks
[22:00:34] <Jake55> so does pure capitalism
[22:00:41] <muhoo> pure anything is doomed
[22:00:44] <muhoo> the world is too complex
[22:01:45] <muhoo> anyway, if you wanted some intern/volunteer hours, approach a local school somewhere and tell them you'll teach the grade-school or middle-school kids to program using something like scratch.mit.edu
[22:02:04] <Jake55> not middle schoool
[22:02:11] <Jake55> kids are really abnoxious at that age :p
[22:02:31] <Jake55> elementry school or better highschool is what i'd probably help out with
[22:02:46] <muhoo> good choice.
[22:03:23] <muhoo> here's some inspiration: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/sites/default/files/CurriculumGuide-v20110923.pdf
[22:03:53] <muhoo> kind of written in educator-jargon, but there's good info and ideas for lessons. you can probably come up with better ones though. have fun.
[22:04:47] <Jake55> :D tnx

[22:55:59] <badoskie> there's a plugin I came across a long time ago but I cannot seem to locate it anymore
[22:57:24] <coldhead> was it this one? http://masonry.desandro.com/

[22:58:52] <tw2113> trying to figure out the bot commands

[23:00:06] <tw2113> at least if it didn't say s server not found
[23:01:41] <coldhead> bot-t.com is back up?!
[23:01:48] <coldhead> no, no it isn't
[23:02:15] <tw2113> technically that cycle command i gave pulled up the one i intended
[23:02:50] <coldhead> only technically?
[23:02:55] <coldhead> sup again Cork
[23:03:23] <Cork> coldhead: running a windows irc client in wine... it crashes from time to time >_>
[23:03:28] <Cork> especially with links -_-
[23:04:07] <ngharo> why
[23:04:47] <Cork> why what?
[23:05:00] <tw2113> yes...the big question...."why?"
[23:05:00] <ngharo> mirc in linux
[23:05:01] <ngharo> why
[23:05:07] <Cork> lol
[23:05:10] <tw2113> xchat!
[23:05:23] <Cork> cause there isn't a single other client that can do what i need
[23:05:30] <Cork> i've been through them all
[23:05:43] <Cork> only one comming close is quassel
[23:06:01] <Cork> but it has no scripting support at all so..
[23:07:09] <ngharo> you're weird
[23:07:14] <ngharo> weirdo
[23:07:46] <Cork> have you ever looked at how far you can control the mirc client through scripts?
[23:08:07] <ngharo> xchat and irssi both have perl scripting
[23:08:17] <ngharo> your question is now invalid
[23:08:19] <Cork> ya,  they do have better scripts
[23:08:32] <Cork> but you can't do nearly as much with the interface through scripts
[23:08:48] <Cork> and thats the problem
[23:09:09] <ngharo> but but open source mannnn
[23:09:22] <Cork> i trying to reimplement it rhough a zmc plugin i'm fiddeling on
[23:09:30] <Cork> but for now, mirc is the best i have
[23:09:37] <Cork> rhough==through
[23:09:44] <ngharo> i fail to see the need for a gui for chat
[23:09:50] <ngharo> but thats me
[23:10:08] <Cork> ngharo: how many channels do you usually hang out in?
[23:10:27] <ngharo> 12 atm
[23:10:30] <ngharo> across various servers
[23:10:40] <Cork> and your active in all of them?
[23:10:50] <ngharo> active in maybe half of them
[23:11:22] <Cork> ya, i wrote a summary window for mirc years ago
[23:11:34] <Cork> i usually was active in 60+ channels back then
[23:11:39] <ngharo> damn son
[23:11:49] <Cork> and it wasn't posible to keep up without a summary window
[23:12:13] <Cork> and now i'm so use to it, i feel like i'm looking through a pipe without it
[23:12:35] <ngharo> what does your summary window do?
[23:12:58] <Cork> it lets me read filterd messages from all servers and all channels
[23:13:01] <Cork> and replay to them
[23:13:29] <ngharo> i see
[23:13:40] <Cork> so instead of a flaching channel name and flipping through them, i can read all channels in a glance
[23:15:09] <ngharo> kinda reminds me of irssi no window mode where all channel activity gets put inside one window
[23:15:17] <ngharo> but im sure there is more to it than that
[23:16:01] <Cork> ngharo: my biggest problem with irssi, is that by design its one window
[23:16:13] <Cork> that kinda rules it out
[23:16:48] <ngharo> window as in at the desktop level?
[23:16:54] <Cork> yes
[23:17:16] <Cork> i don't want to have to bring up the big irc window just to see the summary
[23:17:29] <ngharo> yeah i suppose with 60 chans things would be kind of a mess
[23:17:36] <Cork> :)
[23:17:47] <Cork> i'm not in 60 channels how days, but a good 20
[23:20:02] <badoskie> I am looking for a plugin that can make this stack of div boxes: http://postimage.org/image/6l5txf13x/ rearrange like this: http://postimage.org/image/m22otex5f/
[23:20:29] <badoskie> I know it exists. I have seen it a long time ago, but I just cant find it anymore
[23:20:52] <ngharo> badoskie: i think coldhead just pasted a link to that; masonary
[23:21:02] <ngharo> http://masonry.desandro.com/
[23:23:31] <badoskie> true, it is. Now I'm wondering how coldhead figured it out
[23:23:45] <Cork> lol
[23:24:04] <ngharo> yeah he guessed it first off without any description from you
[23:24:23] <ngharo> freak of nature
[23:24:28] <Cork> its simple he's psychic :)
[23:24:31] <badoskie> yeah. I'm scared :D
[23:25:35] <ngharo> ?tell coldhead you're scaring the children
[23:25:35] <bot-t> ngharo, Okay.
[23:26:05] <someprimetime> i'm about to write a radio checkbox plugin
[23:26:18] <someprimetime> should i target a div containing all elements OR
[23:26:19] <Cork> plugin?
[23:26:23] <someprimetime> target each one individually
[23:26:29] <Cork> plugin for what?
[23:26:31] <someprimetime> so like attaching to the container and just loop through to find all elements
[23:26:36] <someprimetime> custom radio images
[23:26:40] <someprimetime> for radio buttons
[23:26:44] <Cork> ah
[23:27:13] <ngharo> target the element(s) directly, and assume you're receiving a collection everytime
[23:27:18] <Cork> someprimetime: i would attach to the form, and go from there
[23:27:31] <someprimetime> hmm conflicting design decisions
[23:27:35] <someprimetime> which to go with o.O
[23:27:40] <someprimetime> i do like the form idea though
[23:27:44] <someprimetime> seems cleaner
[23:28:17] <Cork> someprimetime: if you go for the form, you only need one event listner for each type
[23:28:26] <someprimetime> Cork: yeah good call
[23:28:27] <someprimetime> thanks
[23:28:29] <Cork> that way to makes it cleaner to handle
[23:28:56] <Cork> and you can make it dynamic so if an radio element is added its handled
[23:29:12] <Cork> (though the initial work would have to be triggered from something)
[23:29:42] <someprimetime> Cork: yeah very good points
[23:51:47] <carlt0n5> anybody have a sec?
[23:51:59] <carlt0n5> issue with simple animation
[23:52:17] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ carlt0n5
[23:52:18] <bot-t> carlt0n5, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:53:06] <carlt0n5> lol thanks bot, i want to do a 'show()' function that treats a div as if doors are opening from the center
[23:53:58] <carlt0n5> so far, closest i have is: show("scale", {mode:'show',direction: 'horizontal' origin:['left','top']}, 1400);
[23:54:34] <carlt0n5> this rather: show("scale", {direction: 'horizontal', origin:['left','top']}, 1400);
[23:54:52] <carlt0n5> but it doesnt work quite right..
[23:55:11] <someprimetime> why don't you have 2 divs on either side with a z-index greater than the content behind it and animate each of them left and right
[23:55:33] <someprimetime> put a container around all of that and make that your target for a hover
[23:55:43] <carlt0n5> that was my next step, but i was hoping i wouldnt have to do so
[23:56:44] <carlt0n5> @someprimetime, think its my best bet?
[23:56:50] <Cork> carlt0n5: what isn't working right?
[23:57:13] <Cork> and how are you positioning the images today?
[23:57:16] <carlt0n5> i want it to seem as if 2 doors are opening up on a div from the center
[23:57:53] <carlt0n5> what someprimetime said was my next move, but was wondering if there was a simple animation i could do
[23:58:21] <Cork> carlt0n5: what browsers do you need to support?
[23:58:34] <carlt0n5> chrome
[23:58:48] <Cork> heh, then ya, you can use multible images
[23:59:12] <Cork> and just positioning them right and left
[23:59:23] <carlt0n5> ok, off to work, thanks guys
[23:59:58] <Cork> and by multible images i mean background-image: url(...), url(...);
