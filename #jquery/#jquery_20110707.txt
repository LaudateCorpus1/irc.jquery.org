[00:00:22] <wkmanire> damn
[00:00:25] <wkmanire> that is compelling
[00:00:27] <sushi4664> djq
[00:00:32] <sushi4664> djQuery: You are awesome
[00:00:55] <rimmjob_> how much javascript do i need to know to start learning jquery?
[00:01:17] <wkmanire> rimmjob_: Thats a tough question. I'd like to say you should be very good at javascript before you start to use jQuery.
[00:01:22] <robertor> rimmjob_, you need a little problem and try to solve it ;-)
[00:01:33] <wkmanire> but on the other hand, you'll be more productive if you just follow some jQuery tutorials in the short run.
[00:01:35] <djQuery> ?jqf@ rimmjob_
[00:01:36] <bot-t> rimmjob_, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[00:01:37] <wkmanire> Depends on your goals I would guess.
[00:01:42] <robertor> rimmjob_, and try to read an article called Javascript no obtrusive
[00:01:47] <ejo> djQuery: wow, I got this!  this is pretty slick... ok, serve up a 30k 800x600 jpeg for each of these 20 images in a row, so it's kind of low quality but not quite crappy enough for the eye to notice a problem at first.  Loads in a snap. Then an AJAX callback that fires when not the images, but the div that holds them, is finished loading... set onload handlers for each image; each onload...
[00:01:49] <ejo> ...handler (1) unbinds the load event and (2) switches the 'src' attribute to the high-res image version's URL.  This works!  And the only bandwith it wastes is the original 30k low-res preview before the 200k hi-res replacement.  Only 15% waste to get seamless quick load
[00:02:07] <djQuery> rimmjob_: it has a little primer on javascript at the start then goes into jquery
[00:02:21] <rimmjob_> ok tyvm
[00:02:27] <wkmanire> rimmjob_: Heres a good question
[00:02:34] <ejo> The trick is that the preview images are from my server, and the high-res ones are from a CDN.  The previews from my server don't get cached so it all triggers as desired
[00:02:35] <wkmanire> have you ever worked with any other C style languages?
[00:02:41] <wkmanire> Such as C, C++, Java or C#?
[00:02:48] <rimmjob_> i've used some C++
[00:02:48] <djQuery> rimmjob_: and dont use the same nick as you use for your lifestyle channels
[00:03:01] <wkmanire> rimmjob_: Then you should absolutely learn javascript first.
[00:03:09] <Trisox> morning can someone look @ my code the submit part with the if valid() feels weird  but it works http://jsfiddle.net/QFAes/2/
[00:03:12] <djQuery> rimmjob_: ?101
[00:03:14] <wkmanire> rimmjob_: Javascript scoping and object lifetimes are completely different.
[00:03:25] <djQuery> rimmjob_: see ?101
[00:03:25] <bot-t> rimmjob_, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[00:03:32] <wkmanire> There isn't even a concept of heap vs stack.
[00:03:32] <djQuery> rimmjob_: very nice book
[00:03:35] <ejo> rofl@lifestyle comment
[00:03:35] <rimmjob_> are they similar to python?
[00:03:40] <wkmanire> Yes
[00:03:51] <ejo> reminds me of a nickname in here about six hours ago: "kannu qumm"
[00:03:52] <wkmanire> similar, except that javascript closures are not readonly.
[00:03:53] <ejo> ugh
[00:05:03] <wkmanire> mmm, cheddar cheese.
[00:05:53] <Trisox> djQuery: could you take a look ? http://jsfiddle.net/QFAes/2/
[00:05:57] <iaj_> Lo there :)
[00:06:11] <djQuery> ejo: its ok when I first saw his nick I thougt "hmmmm I should ask him my blackberry questions."
[00:06:29] <djQuery> Trisox: k looked
[00:06:47] <ejo> egads
[00:06:49] <djQuery> Trisox: mootools? wheres the html?
[00:06:51] <Trisox> und any idea's how to improve it
[00:06:52] <ejo> I'm outta here!
[00:06:57] <iaj_> I've got a task to solve, I want to have a text on a page and once I hover over that text, I want to a) change the size of the surrounding div, and b) change the text... where would I have to take a look at?
[00:07:25] <ejo> iaj_: might I suggest the jQuery docs, they're great!
[00:07:33] <djQuery> iaj_: errr if your asking that then I would say you should start with ?jqf
[00:07:33] * wkmanire chuckles.
[00:07:34] <ejo> those are elementary operations
[00:07:48] <djQuery> see ?jqf
[00:07:48] <bot-t> jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[00:08:02] <wkmanire> djQuery: Damn, you're sure getting a lot of Q&A tonight.
[00:08:28] <Trisox> its a jquery ui dialog that gets opend and needs to submit serialized data but only if the form is valid but i use ui dialog buttons witch has nog submit on it..
[00:08:29] <iaj_> I was playing with animations (success) so far. I just didn't do any hover stuff yet :)
[00:08:33] <iaj_> thanks!
[00:08:57] <ekkis> anyone here know how to debug dynamically loaded javascript in VS2010?
[00:09:25] <wkmanire> iaj_: If you need manually submit a form you know you can always get the form from the DOM and call .submit() right?
[00:09:34] <robertor> wkmanire, thanks... i will try again tomorrow, but you give me a good clue to solve my problem
[00:09:44] <djQuery> Trisox: why are u calling $('#ShopingCartDialog') so much? declare it as a var at least var $shoppin = $('#shoppingCartDialog').dialog({options}}
[00:10:15] <djQuery> Trisox: set the options before you show it?
[00:10:18] <Trisox> yea oke but thats not it for now it just feels dirty to submit and then check if the form is valid
[00:10:35] <Trisox> yes djQuery ofcourse ;)
[00:10:40] <wkmanire> robertor: Well, I'm still not sure exactly what your problem was to begin with
[00:10:46] <wkmanire> but I'm glad you gleened some info off of me.
[00:11:44] <djQuery> to make it easier to read I would pull the button click function out of the definition and give it a regular function
[00:12:28] <djQuery> also I hate having to rewrite validation and form submision my self so I typicaly use the validate plugin and malsup's form plugin
[00:12:32] <djQuery> ?validate
[00:12:33] <bot-t> djQuery, Plugins/Validation/validate - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[00:12:41] <djQuery> ?g malsup form
[00:12:42] <bot-t> djQuery, jQuery Form Plugin - jQuery Plugins by malsup - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[00:12:51] <djQuery> might make ur life easier.
[00:16:16] <heshanh> hey guys im trying to select a LI and change the back ground but the prob is i have a UL with more LI inside the LI li>ul>li, im doing $J(".side-bar li") to pick the li, how do select the LI that im hover and not the lis inside the LI... if that makes any sense
[00:16:47] <djQuery> sushi4664: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/WGMxZ/3/
[00:18:15] <djQuery> heshanh: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/nfbke/
[00:19:59] <pravat> kl
[00:20:02] <pravat> nkl
[00:20:04] <pravat> jnlknl
[00:22:08] <iaj_> Hm, which function would I use to replace a content of a surrounding div when hovering over one its <p>'s inside?
[00:22:37] <heshanh> hmmm i dun think that what im trying to do dj. sorry if i confused u. when i hover over a li is there way to change the bg color of that li ?
[00:22:48] <Trisox> djQuery: i use http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[00:23:03] <heshanh> im doing $J(".side-bar li").hover(function() { $J(this).css(...) })
[00:24:32] <wkmanire> heshanh: Why use javascript for that in the first place?
[00:24:45] <wkmanire> why just use the :hover CSS psuedo-class?
[00:25:04] <heshanh> i tried but couldnt get it to work, does :hover work on LI ?
[00:25:32] <wkmanire> I'm pretty sure it does but I could be wrong
[00:25:40] <spliter> heshanh: are you testing it in IE?
[00:25:45] <heshanh> ff 5
[00:25:55] <spliter> heshanh: then li:hover should work just fine
[00:26:05] <spliter> :hover on li doesn't work in IE only I think
[00:26:05] <spliter> ]
[00:26:40] <heshanh> actually the issue was that there was anohter UL inside the LI and it would high light the whole thing
[00:27:04] <wkmanire> heshanh: Then use a more specific selector
[00:27:13] <wkmanire> such as ul > li or give the li a class
[00:27:55] <spliter> heshanh: what do you wnat to highlight then?
[00:28:12] <spliter> heshanh: of course if the LI has UL inside, the selector wil laffect it as well
[00:28:25] <spliter> and will happen no matter whether you;'re using CSS or JS
[00:29:41] <heshanh> hmmm crap i didnt think of that. there really is no way to highlight it withouht doing it to everytuing inside it :S
[00:30:23] <spliter> heshanh: you can wrap the content of your <li> with span, for example and then make .side-bar li > span then
[00:30:26] <wkmanire> heshanh: You might need to reorganize your HTML a little bit
[00:30:32] <wkmanire> spliter: he he, exactly.
[00:30:41] <spliter> if what you really need is to highlight the content of the li without diving into it's UL child
[00:30:54] <heshanh> lol nah u guys are right there is no way i can do this unless i re do the html
[00:30:59] * spliter somehow feels this chanel more CSS-related than #css :-P
[00:31:16] <heshanh> which i cant cos its coming from a joomla mod.
[00:31:46] <wkmanire> heshanh: You'll have to do some javascript hackery then.
[00:32:40] <wkmanire> heshanh: Sometimes those giant CMS platforms are more trouble than they're worth.
[00:32:56] <heshanh> see i can highlight the A, which is whats happening now but the a has padding all around it so when its hilighted its not filling the whole li
[00:33:44] <heshanh> yeah, but i really have no choice on this :( sites already done on joomla and i ahveto do  a new tempalte
[00:34:56] <spliter> heshanh: did you try to set .side-bar li > a {display: block}? Then the <a> will fill the whole li's width
[00:35:08] <wkmanire> heshanh: So hackery is justified.
[00:35:11] <wkmanire> good luck.
[00:35:12] <wkmanire> good night folks
[00:35:26] <spliter> and then you should be fine with highlighting just the <a> I think
[00:36:01] <spliter> heshanh: and remove a)padding from li elements, b)margins from li > a
[00:38:46] <Anticom> is there a way to select multiple children like editRoot.children('td:eq(5,7,9)').html('autosuggest');
[00:38:55] <Anticom> i mean the expression in children()
[00:39:04] <Anticom> because that snippet doesn't work
[00:39:51] <heshanh> nope margin still pushes the whole box to the left :(
[00:39:56] <heshanh> http://113.20.8.41/~villates/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=25&Itemid=36
[00:43:22] <djQuery> Anticom: see ?:odd
[00:43:22] <bot-t> Anticom, :odd: Selects odd elements, zero-indexed. See also even. http://api.jquery.com/odd-selector/
[00:45:01] <heshanh> ah theres a span tag inside the A
[00:45:06] <heshanh> i can margin that one
[00:48:04] <shkiper> why may say how I can resize my div as it do the grid option, but using resize event
[00:51:32] <webresour> Hello. I know that this is not the correct room, but you may know the answer in my question. I have that code http://pastebin.com/3nXBAaVe and I like to know what is the meaning of the line 19.
[00:52:37] <webresour> I know that the tinyMCE returns the encode of the #content value but I can't understaint what is the meaning of ", lines;"
[00:52:47] <webresour> what that means ? :?
[00:53:12] <spliter> webresour: it;s just the decalration of the lines variable
[00:53:29] <spliter> webline 19 declares 2 variables - h and lines
[00:53:44] <spliter> if you put decalrations on one line you separate them with coma
[00:53:46] <spliter> that's it
[00:54:06] <webresour> spliter: Ah ! Thanks a lot ! :) Now is more clear to me :) Kind regards, have a nice day :)
[00:54:16] <spliter> good luck webresour
[01:00:46] <Anticom> djQuery: i don't want to select all odd children =/
[01:01:20] <Anticom> and they don't have to be odd; that was only accidentally the case here
[01:02:46] <iaj_> hmm, is there something wrong with that syntax: http://pastebin.com/k06RMwqH ?
[01:04:11] <JKarsrud> iaj_: unless you've saved jQuery in $jQuery, yes
[01:04:17] <JKarsrud> it's either $ or jQuery
[01:04:26] <JKarsrud> not both at the same time :)
[01:04:35] <iaj_> ouch

[01:11:36] <otiteca> Taht happend often that when i use a plugin with the latest version of JQuery, i do have this error from the plugin: $(input).attr is not a function
[01:12:27] <otiteca> Is this an version incompatibility between the plugin and JQuery, Normally .attr() is a standard method of jQuery...

[01:30:43] <SpaceghostC2C> Skizu: /msg nickserv help register
[01:30:53] <Skizu> Ty
[01:35:45] <SpaceghostC2C> Dear douchebag, thanks for deleting the course for no reason.
[01:36:47] <SpaceghostC2C> Some moroccan fucktard.
[01:39:26] <SpaceghostC2C> 41.143.17.58/join #freenode
[01:39:49] <JKarsrud> is there a way to do a callback in .animate() when the animation starts?
[01:40:05] <Skizu> Anyone here cool ?
[01:40:18] <JKarsrud> Skizu: I'm very cool
[01:40:46] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm sober, so not cool at all.
[01:55:26] <Skizu> Anyone here ?
[01:55:33] * Skizu needs help with some simple php
[01:56:21] <iszak> ##php
[01:56:38] <dr0id> rly?
[01:56:59] <iszak> SpaceghostC2C, it was me.
[01:57:24] <Skizu> Lol hi dr-id
[01:57:31] <Skizu> http://codepad.org/HmETD6o8
[01:57:36] <Skizu> The last line errors >_>!
[01:57:42] <iszak> OI
[01:57:44] <iszak> I said ##php
[01:57:52] <dr0id> OI
[01:57:55] <dr0id> I said rly?
[01:57:59] <iszak> I said STFU
[01:58:08] <iszak> This is not a PHP support channel.
[01:58:27] <dr0id> no, ##Php
[01:59:14] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: How about you don't do that again and we'll call it even.
[01:59:33] <iszak> SpaceghostC2C, sure if I did it in the first place.
[01:59:44] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: You said it was you.
[01:59:56] <iszak> and you believe everything everyone tells you?
[02:00:17] <iszak> either way, wasn't me - cool that you're using rails tho.
[02:01:13] <SpaceghostC2C> It's a fun tool. Good prototyping and if the project doesn't get large enough to scale, it's done. But if you need to make it more performant it's easy to drop down to C or java or whatever and rewrite important parts.
[02:01:40] <iszak> Ruby performs just fine.
[02:02:56] <dr0id> what performs the best
[02:03:56] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: Lawl.
[02:04:10] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm a rubyist and even I know that it takes a lot of work to get it to scale correctly.
[02:05:25] <sasori> question: am at the firebug console, why is it that am getting "ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined" message whevener I tried to get the value of  a currently selected option from atdropdown menu?
[02:05:58] <sasori> like e.g jQuery("#cv _datecreated").value()
[02:06:00] <iszak> SpaceghostC2C, just like any framework
[02:07:14] <dr0id> what performs the best ?
[02:07:39] <sasori> nevermind my query above...
[02:08:22] <iszak> dr0id, it's not about what performances the best.
[02:08:34] <iszak> what performances the best may take forever to develop in, you've got to get a balance.
[02:12:03] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: Not quite. But sure why not
[02:12:17] <aaronmcadam> does anyone know of a sensible way to find out if  a method is chainable
[02:12:28] <aaronmcadam> or is there a post about it anywhere?
[02:13:53] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: Well, rails is great and is something you can sit comfortably in for a time.
[02:14:34] <SpaceghostC2C> But if you get traffic that really pounds the application, you're going to need to pull different parts into more performant solutions than what you'll get with most stuff.
[02:14:38] <aaronmcadam> ah, if the api docs for the method says it returns jQuery, that should be it right?
[02:14:42] <JeanM> is there a known issue with Safari and window.load? Somehow when I set a timer to get the offset of elements, it keeps changing for the first x miliseconds until the elements are actually correctly placed. Something tells me this is not the way it's supposed to work?
[02:15:17] <iaj_> hmm, JKarsrud, still got trouble... http://pastebin.com/haPeFSPA  that should be correct right?
[02:15:36] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: Besides, the only times I like being lied to is in bed.
[02:15:43] <JKarsrud> you're missing a ' after custom2
[02:16:02] <JKarsrud> iaj_: what kind of editor are you using? Seems like something that hasn't got syntax highlighting
[02:16:17] <JKarsrud> http://pastebin.com/uLqisvc0
[02:16:19] <JKarsrud> you see it now
[02:16:25] <JKarsrud> toggleClass should not be blue
[02:16:26] <iszak> SpaceghostC2C, eh?
[02:16:43] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: About the whole, "How do you know it was me?" after you said you did it.
[02:17:18] <iszak> I don't get it.

[02:20:09] <Me-Selfe> SpaceghostC2C: $(this).attr
[02:21:15] <SpaceghostC2C> Me-Selfe: Thanks. I have to remember to use it as a selector then, huh?
[02:21:32] <Me-Selfe> yes
[02:21:47] <SpaceghostC2C> Thanks you
[02:21:55] <SpaceghostC2C> Thank you.
[02:22:14] <Me-Selfe> "this2 is the html object and you need a jquery object for .attr
[02:23:36] <iszak> SpaceghostC2C, still don't get it.
[02:24:16] <SpaceghostC2C> iszak: It's okay.
[02:26:20] <iaj_> JKarsrud; hmm strange its not pulling off... when I click on p.moreabout nothing happens - do you know what might be an issue?
[02:28:36] <seutje> any1 got an idea why this bookmarklet constantly makes my inspector crash in chrome? javascript:(function($,r,a,q){$('link').each(function(){var t=$(this),h=t.attr(a);t.attr(a,h.split(q)[0]+q+r);});})(jQuery,new Date().getTime(),'href','?');
[02:29:04] <seutje> it just goes over all <link> tags and appends a timestamp to their href so they get reloaded
[02:29:06] <JKarsrud> iaj_: I need some markup to debug that
[02:29:41] <iaj_> jkarsud: hmm, I got it on that page, http://www.marcgalal.com/hoerbuch14 its on the lower right part in that purp box
[02:29:41] <SpaceghostC2C> http://pastie.org/2176759 I'm getting Uncaught ReferenceError: audio is not defined

[02:31:33] <DrunkenSail0r> what if you use " " to wrap the audio?
[02:31:43] <DrunkenSail0r> and the other cases to
[02:32:38] <SpaceghostC2C> DrunkenSail0r: That was it. Thank you.
[02:32:43] <DrunkenSail0r> np
[02:33:39] <iaj_> jkarsud: nvm got it sorted - thanks a bunch
[02:34:40] <mayanks43> the jquery.autocomplete and autocomplete of jquery ui are different ?
[02:38:50] <DrunkenSail0r> is that a question or some kind of statement?
[02:39:29] <mayanks43> question
[02:40:14] <mayanks43> ok http://jsfiddle.net/LMYRw/
[02:45:05] <MoTiOnXml> i'm thinking about creating a widget for handling ctrl+v, c, x commands; i'm not overriding, just listening, and was wondering if creating a widget on $(document) would be a good idea;
[02:45:46] <MoTiOnXml> the goal is that other widgets should be able to do a $(document).widget(..) and ask for the current state
[02:45:49] <MoTiOnXml> does that make sense?
[02:46:02] <MoTiOnXml> just wondering if widgets would be the right pattern for this
[02:46:31] <MoTiOnXml> basically it's global state management depending on what the user clicked
[02:48:12] <DrunkenSail0r> mayanks43: your inputs are set to autocomplete="off", i don'tknow if jquery uses this attrib in some way
[02:50:41] <mayanks43> it switches to on when autocomplete is working
[02:51:01] <DrunkenSail0r> ah ok
[02:57:27] <mayanks43> ok in this one autocomplete works but not on the cloned textboxes http://jsfiddle.net/LMYRw/3/

[03:09:07] <Dirkos> When im doing a form.submit() (as GET form) the button itself wont be posted?
[03:09:41] <Dirkos> how can i make sure that the button is posted too? the input#submit.click() wont work since im already catching that event (will end up in a loop)
[03:13:18] <pasiaj> hi all
[03:13:23] <pasiaj> Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://elemental/html/get_url.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpumpula.net from frame with URL http://elemental/html/app.html. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[03:13:44] <pasiaj> I'm having a problem accessing the contents of an iframe
[03:14:21] <pasiaj> Safari keeps giving me a xss-error, even though the domains, protocols & ports DO match
[03:14:29] <Me-Selfe> pasiaj: is that an exact paste of the error?
[03:14:37] <pasiaj> yup
[03:16:01] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: Have you ever had a problem like this?
[03:17:56] <Lomex> hey I want some twitter style loading of new comments. Right now I load all comment code with load(). How can I automatically get new comments loaded in twitter style? :D
[03:18:15] <Me-Selfe> pasiaj: got an url i can test?
[03:18:54] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: Just a sec, gotta git-pull
[03:19:52] <Kingsy> can I get an elements contents with attr() ?
[03:20:03] <Me-Selfe> Kingsy: no
[03:20:04] <Kingsy> or what is the best function to use?
[03:20:09] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: http://elementalapp.com/app/html/app.html
[03:20:13] <Me-Selfe> Kingsy: what content do you want?
[03:20:18] <Kingsy> for example..
[03:20:27] <Kingsy> <span>THIS IS WHAT I NEED</span>
[03:20:44] <Kingsy> I need to console.log("THIS IS WHAT I NEED");
[03:20:45] <mayanks43> this works http://jsfiddle.net/LMYRw/4/
[03:20:47] <Me-Selfe> pasiaj: and you get the error by..
[03:21:12] <Me-Selfe> Kingsy: add an id to the element, and do $('#id-here').html()
[03:21:19] <Kingsy> ah .html() .. ok
[03:21:36] <Lomex> how can i get the id of an element i just click on?
[03:22:05] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: input any url in the input field and press 'Load'
[03:22:29] <Me-Selfe> Lomex: $(this).attr('id');
[03:23:23] <pasiaj> Kingsy:  .text() gets you the innerText
[03:24:12] <Me-Selfe> pasiaj: seem weird, try set document.domain = 'elementalapp.com'; on main page and iframe?
[03:24:28] <Me-Selfe> even tho it shouldn't be needed as its same host afaik
[03:25:11] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: Thanks, I'll try that, just in case. Could it be a problem, that the iframe is dynamically loaded?
[03:25:53] <Me-Selfe> i doubt it.. I just did some of the same, but i had document.domain set
[03:28:56] <pasiaj> Lomex:  $(document).click(function(event){ console.log( event.currentTarget.id ) });
[03:30:59] <DrunkenSail0r> mayanks43: what did you change? I'm trying to solve it too ^^
[03:31:42] <Lomex> pasiaj: What is this?
[03:31:44] <Lomex> Im using $(this).attr('id'); now
[03:31:56] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:32:00] <aaronmcadam> ?this @ Lomex
[03:32:00] <bot-t> Lomex, that.
[03:32:05] <DrunkenSail0r> ah I see, just clone the element and the bind the autocomplete again?
[03:32:05] <aaronmcadam> hah!
[03:32:09] <Lomex> huh?
[03:32:21] <aaronmcadam> Lomex, this is a contextual reference to the object
[03:32:30] <aaronmcadam> running in the function
[03:32:49] <Lomex> my question was not what $this is, but what pasiaj wanted to tell me sorry :P
[03:33:05] <aaronmcadam> say u had $(id).click( function() { this } );
[03:33:15] <aaronmcadam> this there would refer to the element that matches the id
[03:33:24] <Lomex> yes I got it working now
[03:33:27] <Lomex> My other problem is
[03:33:32] <aaronmcadam> kk
[03:33:40] <Lomex> Im passing $(this).attr('id'); to load() and now load seems to do a POST request instead of get
[03:33:53] <Lomex> How can i still make load() use post request? :(
[03:33:56] <Lomex> um I mean get sorry
[03:34:06] <Lomex>   $("#comments").load("index.php?r=comment",{postid: $(this).attr('id')});
[03:34:09] <Lomex> This is what im doing
[03:34:30] <Lomex> How can i force load() to use GET to send those parameters
[03:35:19] <pasiaj> Lomex: GET doesn't have parameters, it just has an url (in which you can put parameters in)
[03:35:36] <Lomex> Oh okay
[03:35:45] <pasiaj> Lomex: You have to parse the url yourself
[03:35:46] <Lomex> so i just use the first url and add the id
[03:36:15] <pasiaj> Lomex: ("irc://irc.freenode.net/#comments").load("index.php?r=comment&id=something");
[03:36:56] <Lomex> yes thanks
[03:37:02] <pasiaj> member:Lomex: ("irc://irc.freenode.net/#comments").load("index.php?r=comment&postid=" + $(this).attr('id'));
[03:37:50] <Anticom> can anyone tell me, how to get this thing working? http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/
[03:37:51] <pasiaj> Sorry for the copypaste crap, I suck at irc (and irl)
[03:38:01] <Anticom> i've tried everything in my oppinion but i can't get it working
[03:38:50] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: decument.domain was already set
[03:39:25] <rwat> I've got a table with many rows and 4 columns. For each row cells  1,2,3 fill data via ajax calls. I want column 4 to say "done" when cells 1,2,3 are filled. I've been trying to use $.when but it seems to return immediately - any clues?
[03:39:55] <guy> is it possible to associated data with specific selected-element? e.g. $('li.first').data('var_name', 'test'); [..] then next time when I do for(var i=0, j = $('li').length; i<j; i++){  [I could check here if the $(this) element has any data associated with it] }
[03:40:07] <DrunkenSail0r> mayanks43: at http://jsfiddle.net/LMYRw/4/ is a version where the autocomplete really only gets bound once and not over and over again
[03:40:24] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/HTdzG7Bs
[03:40:31] <Anticom> path's to includes etc are valid
[03:43:21] <Predator> hi
[03:43:38] <rwat> can I say "wait until these 3 elements have changed" then do this()?
[03:43:49] <aaronmcadam> JKarsrud, do u know of a list anywhere? or a way to filter the API to methods that return jQuery? I'm always wondering for some functions whether i need to call end()
[03:44:04] <PrinceES> I want to play a flv video on the home page banner and i am using this jquery plugin.. http://www.awkwardgroup.com/sandbox/awkward-showcase-a-jquery-plugin/
[03:44:07] <aaronmcadam> c/p from dev sorry. does anyone know?
[03:45:37] <Predator> is it possible to call a jquery load spinner with php upload module?
[03:46:06] <Predator> can php call a jquery function?
[03:46:29] <Kingsy> is it possible to get jquery to run LAST? and I mean last.. after all css images everything is loaded
[03:46:38] <Kingsy> just a specific query I mean
[03:46:58] <Kingsy> like for example, if I wanted console.log() to run last
[03:47:47] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: sorry, I don't.
[03:47:58] <JKarsrud> I usually just end() find and filter, basically
[03:48:16] <JKarsrud> because they edit the collection
[03:49:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[03:49:07] <aaronmcadam> I'd just like to have a list somewhere
[03:49:33] <aaronmcadam> there's bound to be, actually, I could filter the xml feed i gues
[03:49:34] <aaronmcadam> there's bound to be, actually, I could filter the xml feed i guess
[03:52:19] <deliya> hi all, i have 2 pages. i declare a variable in page A. so, when i request page B with jQuery. ajax, i've null value when use that variable. what can i do?
[03:55:00] <VictorCl2> how can I check in one select  if a div has two clases   like <div class="tab lime"></div>     .... I need to check if it has those two clases
[03:55:58] <VictorCl2> $("div[class~="tab"]");   I know I can do that for one class..
[03:57:30] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam; sure, you could do that :)
[04:01:05] <pasiaj> Me-Selfe: The iframe had a 'sandbox' attribute
[04:05:06] <Me-Selfe> pasiaj: ah, okey
[04:09:05] <Freddi> hello, i could do with som help, http://jsfiddle.net/5AQpD/ trying to run a function based on current page url
[04:12:57] <Chib> VictorCl2: if statements with http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[04:23:52] <ateam> hi
[04:24:38] <Thomas`-> hey. is there anyway to get an element in a list that does not have a specific class?
[04:25:00] <Chib> Freddi: i suspect your problems relate to you trying to redeclare the subNav variable inside your if
[04:25:07] <ateam> any idea why the divs are not in a list..they are on top of each other: http://www.pastie.org/2177126
[04:25:19] <Chib> you also have no closing brace for your for loop, although that may just be a copypaste fail
[04:26:08] <Chib> and a comma after the final element in the array you declared probably isn't a good idea, althoug i doubt it'll cause problems
[04:27:57] <coachz> I have a table in my page.  Can i reference it from a popup?  On the page I get the data with:   $("#table0").html()
[04:28:06] <Chib> Thomas`-: i suspect his is what you're looking for http://api.jquery.com/not/
[04:29:09] <Thomas`-> thanks i'll try it
[04:31:48] <aaronmcadam> yo ateam
[04:31:56] <Chib> ateam: what do you mean by a list? not sure what you're trying to do...
[04:32:15] <aaronmcadam> put up an example on jsfiddle, and define json above your for loop
[04:32:40] <aaronmcadam> he's trying to load some divs based on some json
[04:32:48] <Chib> coachz: reference how? give more detail as to what you want to do
[04:32:51] <coachz> Is there a way for me to get my table html that's in my main page from inside a popup ?
[04:33:15] <coachz> i was told to look at self.parent  but don't know how it works
[04:33:37] <coachz> so i have a popup and in the popup i'm trying to get the content from a table that is in the main page
[04:33:37] <Chib> why can't you just use a selector like $("table")
[04:34:04] <Chib> an actual separate window popup?
[04:34:17] <coachz> yeah
[04:34:24] <coachz> $("#table0").html()   returns null from the popup
[04:34:38] <coachz> i believe it's thickbox
[04:35:28] <phryk> Good morning there.
[04:35:43] <Chib> i don't see how if it's an entirely different page unless you're using ajax? question is beyond me probably
[04:36:18] <coachz> sorry, it's the same page
[04:36:56] <coachz> but  $("#table0").html()   returns null from the popup
[04:37:04] <Chib> paste something cut down on jsfiddle.net so we can take a look
[04:37:19] <coachz> i wish i knew how to use that fiddle thing
[04:37:43] <Chib> copy paste (: html goes in html box, javascript in javascript box
[04:37:52] <Chib> select jquery to include that on the left
[04:37:55] <Chib> all there is to it really
[04:38:11] <phryk> I'm having a little problem with firefox and am interested if this is known. I have a few divs of the same structure holding an image and a bit of text. at window.onresize I resize the img's of all divs to window.innerWidth (or at least 990). I do fadeIn/fadeOut actions on these divs with a setInterval.
[04:38:20] <coachz> i'm not good at creating a test case
[04:38:40] <coachz> much less adding thickbox pops
[04:39:22] <phryk> Everything working fine so far. However when I resize firefox (works fine in chromium) while a fade animation is playing it gets insanely slow, rendering the whole machine unusable, even after the animation and resizes are done it stays that slow…
[04:39:49] <phryk> the only thing helping me in that state is sshing into the machine killing off firefox manually
[04:42:40] <coachz> isn't there a jquery command that will start at the top of my page and go down till it finds the element ?   $("#table0").html()
[04:42:50] <coachz> regardless of if i call it in a popup or not ?
[04:44:49] <Chib> that's what $("#table0") is supposed to do (:
[04:45:03] <Chib> or rather, that's what it does
[04:45:03] <coachz> it returns null from the popup though
[04:45:22] <krz> anyone use markitup before? know how to delete buttons?
[04:45:33] <krz> all i want is the paragraph button on the toolbar
[04:45:35] <krz> nothing else
[04:45:40] <Chib> got no idea what it's doing without an example coachz  /:
[04:45:56] <coachz> ok, bummer
[04:47:23] <stenno> good day, i seem to use .replaceWith wrong: the selector works correct, the DOM element i want it to get replaced with is there and correct, but i get Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8 in the line where i do the .replaceWith
[04:47:59] <stenno> can't i use .replaceWith with a DOM element as the parameter?
[04:48:21] <Me-Selfe> stenno: whats the code that gives this error?
[04:48:29] <stenno> just a second
[04:49:22] <stenno> $(selector + " img.right").replaceWith($.slideshow.vars.spreads[index][1]); // where selector works correctly(tried it out in the developer console, and spreads[index][1] holds a Image DOM element
[04:49:38] <Chib> phryk: perhaps you could use something $(window).resize() to intervene and do other things when the window is resizing?
[04:50:10] <stenno> Me-Selfe, as i said, i checked both selector and parameter, and both seem to be correct
[04:50:13] <Chib> wouldn't be as simple as that but...
[04:50:20] <coachz> with jsfiddle, how would i add  thickbox.js
[04:50:33] <coachz> do  i point to my local file or some internet link ?
[04:52:42] <Chib> actually i'm not sure if it's possible s:
[04:54:10] <stenno> oh never mind, it was a mistake on my side
[04:55:07] <lenswipe> *yawn*
[04:55:09] <lenswipe> anyone online?
[04:55:14] <coachz> nope
[04:55:14] * Chib shrugs
[04:55:18] <lenswipe> lol
[04:55:44] <lenswipe> i want to take text from forename and surname and create a username from it while the user types
[04:56:02] <lenswipe> so like i have forename and surname fields
[04:56:33] <lenswipe> the user types in forename: John surname: smith i want i to generate smithJ10
[04:58:16] <Me-Selfe> lenswipe: the problem is?
[04:58:24] <Chib> is forename a real word? (:
[04:58:27] <coachz> learning how to get a substring
[04:59:14] <lenswipe> Me-Selfe, i dont know where to start
[04:59:44] <stenno> can't you just say string[0] ?
[04:59:45] <lenswipe> Chib, i dont think HTML allows you to call fields "Please print your name in the square box that has a retardedly long name"
[05:00:11] <lenswipe> Chib, anyway since when was this #spellingandgrammar
[05:00:12] <stenno> or do you get the char as ASCII integer?
[05:00:39] <stenno> v8>"bla"[0];
[05:00:44] <stenno> no v8?
[05:00:45] <lenswipe> someone in here i think it was DarkHouse helped me with this before and then i had a HDD crash and lost it
[05:00:52] <Chib> lenswipe: i was kidding, relax (:
[05:02:12] <lenswipe> Chib, k, sorry its just if i seem a bit ratty i keep getting phoned by BT to do fucking surveys
[05:03:59] <atrioom> whats up guys? i have a problem i need help with...
[05:08:40] <arnorhs> atrioom: what's the problem?
[05:08:57] <atrioom> Anybody expierienced a viewport problem when manipulating elements? I am fading in divs and (when scrolled down to bottom) on every interval the viewport jumps to the faded element!
[05:09:23] <lenswipe> anyone able to help with my problem?
[05:10:23] <coachz> lenswiipe, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp
[05:10:28] <Lomex> Can anyone recommend me to load new comments for example with ajax?
[05:10:29] <atrioom> i want the viewport to stay still (doing no scrolling) and not to jump around just because im fading stuff at the top...
[05:10:38] <arnorhs> atrioom: fading an element will not move the viewport - something else is moving it
[05:10:49] <Lomex> Sorry I meant, if someone can recommend me a technique to load new comments for example with ajax
[05:10:55] <Lomex> Right now I just load a full list of my comments
[05:10:56] <lenswipe> coachz, i was hoping to do it with jquery - is that advisable?
[05:11:04] <coachz> not needed
[05:11:15] <lenswipe> ok
[05:11:41] <lenswipe> coachz, in the solution i had previously i had a block of javascript under my form elements that handled it rather than using onClick() is that possible with javascript?
[05:12:51] <atrioom> i found something on that in the jquery forum, but that solution was suggesting that on an event (eg click) a href is loaded (empty) and therefore altering the viewport. didnt help me, because its fading on interval without clicking links...  its kind of an info-slider, only with fading...
[05:12:57] <coachz> put all your code in   <script type="text/javascript">
[05:12:57] <coachz> 	$(document).ready(function() {	}); </script>
[05:13:16] <coachz> at the bottom of your page or in an include file
[05:13:25] <coachz> just above </body>
[05:13:45] <Freddi> variables can't be declared with in a function can they
[05:13:51] <Freddi> ?
[05:14:08] <coachz> sure they can
[05:14:10] <lenswipe> Freddi, yeah
[05:14:16] <lenswipe> coachz, by the way/....
[05:14:27] <coachz> just don't loop over it and redeclare it
[05:15:04] <lenswipe> coachz, http://pastebin.com/kTeTbYMs
[05:15:06] <lenswipe> is that it?
[05:15:20] <lenswipe> well i mean is that how its sort of supposed to be laid out
[05:15:34] <coachz> yep
[05:18:11] <lenswipe> coachz, http://pastebin.com/BUmkakcM
[05:18:15] <lenswipe> coachz, hows that?
[05:18:33] <Chib> use jsfiddle lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/Chib/nzWD8/
[05:19:28] <BlaDe> Hey - I have a json encoded array which is basically like   [ folder_id, folder_name, children [ [folder_id, folder_name, children [ ] ], [folder_id, folder............ ] ];
[05:19:42] <lenswipe> thanks
[05:19:53] <BlaDe> what'd be the best way to produce an explorer type browser from it?
[05:20:16] <Chib> np, i'm bored (:
[05:21:36] <coachz> BlaDe, use treeview plugin
[05:21:43] <lenswipe> Chib, im trying to have it set a field rather than a div - how do i do that?
[05:21:43] <BlaDe> i don't want a treeview
[05:22:00] <coachz> explorer type ?
[05:22:24] <Chib> lenswipe: use val("x") instead of html("x")
[05:22:26] <BlaDe> coachz yeah ... like if you opened a file browser in windows for example
[05:22:33] <lenswipe> Chib, http://jsfiddle.net/nzWD8/1/
[05:22:37] <BlaDe> you have icons of folders, double click, you go into the next folder
[05:22:43] <coachz> but no tree
[05:22:49] <BlaDe> coachz correct
[05:23:43] <coachz> not sure on that
[05:24:40] <Freddi> http://jsfiddle.net/A2XVA/ - does this make more sense ? at least can you see what i am trying to do ? :P
[05:24:45] <BlaDe> ok np
[05:25:26] <Chib> lenswipe: don't put <script> tags in jsfiddle, it'll break it, also it's val() not value() and uh.. i don't know what <?= rand() ?> that is
[05:25:43] <lenswipe> <?=rand() ?> is PHP to put a random number in there
[05:25:53] <Chib> ah, that won't work in jsfiddle
[05:26:02] <Chib> should be good in your code though after you change value to val
[05:26:20] <lenswipe> yeah i know
[05:26:28] <coachz> use     var randomnumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*11)
[05:26:38] <atrioom> @arnorhs This is a jsfiddle of the working script. Works like a dream BUT: when you scroll far down (minimize and scroll) it jumps back up at every interval. any ideas how to keep it from doing that?
[05:26:44] <lenswipe> coachz, no because the number will change on every key press - not desireable
[05:26:47] <Chib> you can use Math.round(Math.random()*10) in javascript if you want btw
[05:26:54] <lenswipe> Chib see above
[05:26:55] <Chib> oh
[05:26:57] <Chib> heh
[05:27:11] <lenswipe> Chib, how do i have js take something to lowercase?
[05:27:42] <Chib> this is a really handy site: http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/
[05:28:06] <Chib> for instance click strings and you can see a function toLowerCase()
[05:29:15] <lenswipe> Chib, yeah i know about that function - my problem is getting the bugger to work :p
[05:29:31] <Chib> how are you calling it?
[05:30:26] <lenswipe> nevermind thats it - thank you :D
[05:30:35] <Chib> (:
[05:30:36] <lenswipe> Chib, for some reason it wasnt working - but thats it now :D
[05:30:40] <lenswipe> thanks for the help
[05:30:44] <Chib> np
[05:34:57] <JeanM> Is there any known issue with webkit not updating styles set in external stylesheets when a class gets added through jquery?
[05:35:28] <JeanM> In Safari, I added a class but the change didn't take effect until I manipulated the element some other way (setting font-size to 100% f.e.
[05:40:54] <atrioom> k, i have to go, ill try it again in the evening! hf guys
[05:43:23] <seutje> aaargh, why does my chrome inspector crash every time I run a bookmarklet that iterates over all <link> elements and appends a random string to their href?
[05:43:28] <seutje> -> (function(a,b,c,d,e){d=a.length;for(;d--;){e=a[d];if(e.rel=='stylesheet'){e.href=e.href.split(c)[0]+c+b;}}})(document.getElementsByTagName('link'),new Date().getTime(),'?');
[05:49:12] <aaronmcadam> seutje, why do u do that?
[05:49:24] <aaronmcadam> cache bursting?
[05:49:29] <seutje> reload css
[05:49:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:50:10] <seutje> working on a project with an extremely slow backend, so I really don't wanna be spamming f5 or anything
[05:50:22] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[05:50:34] <aaronmcadam> in firebug i'd just disable cache
[05:50:39] <aaronmcadam> but chrome alas
[05:50:58] <aaronmcadam> why don't you just append it on in your code
[05:51:17] <aaronmcadam> in your template, what server side lang u using
[05:52:05] <aaronmcadam> in django, i just do <script type="text/javascript" src="/media/project/js/main.js?{% now "c" %}"></script>
[05:53:00] <kapowaz> Anybody with familiarity with QUnit got any opinions on how to structure your tests directories + library files in a ruby web app?
[05:53:04] <lessless> people, the accordion menu is shaking on collapse in IE http://stezja.kiev.ua/index0.php?_query=Pages./pages/init  how i can fix it ?
[05:53:10] <kapowaz> (not Rails, but not too different)
[05:53:25] <stenno> hmm i want to replaceWith() dom element 1 with dom element 2. Replacing it removes all css rules i previously defined with .css(). Is there a way to replace the element, but to keep these rules intact?
[05:54:34] <aaronmcadam> stenno
[05:54:41] <aaronmcadam> define the css in your stylesheet
[05:54:46] <aaronmcadam> and define classes
[05:54:50] <aaronmcadam> and add or remove them
[05:54:52] <kapowaz> what he said.
[05:55:05] <kapowaz> easier than adding a whole bunch of styles dynamically, and they'll automatically be inherited
[05:55:18] <kapowaz> unless you're doing some fancy positioning malarkey?
[05:55:27] <stenno> aaronmcadam, thought about that too, but depending on certain circumstances, the rules change
[05:55:35] <aaronmcadam> nothing wrong with that
[05:55:39] <aaronmcadam> just have a load of classes
[05:55:48] <stenno> alright
[05:55:49] <aaronmcadam> or have a function that you can call
[05:55:49] <kapowaz> in which case you could clone the specific rules you know you want to keep and apply them to the new element
[05:55:55] <REYPA> hi guys
[05:56:09] <kapowaz> aaronmcadam: I've had to do stuff with fixed positioning that would make classes unworkable, so it's not always the best solution
[05:56:30] <Segaja> hi, can someone tell me a nice WYSIWYG editor where i can switch between the WYSIWYG view and the source view?
[05:56:30] <stenno> aaronmcadam, kapowaz thanks so far, i will see how this can be done :)
[05:56:33] <aaronmcadam> yeah if that's the case, just refactor your styling into a function
[05:56:38] <kapowaz> +1
[05:56:43] <kapowaz> so.... QUnit?
[05:56:51] <reypa> does sombedy know that error? "b.split is not a function"
[05:57:00] <aaronmcadam> ?g dreamweaver @ Segaja
[05:57:04] <aaronmcadam> :D
[05:57:15] <stenno> reypa, maybe b is not an array...?
[05:57:18] <aaronmcadam> is bot down
[05:57:28] <kapowaz> or a string
[05:57:37] <stenno> i mean string
[05:57:39] <stenno> of course
[05:57:44] <stenno> can you .split an array..?
[05:57:52] <kapowaz> I don't think so
[05:58:00] <kapowaz> not something I've ever tried, anyway :)
[05:58:02] <reypa> stenno, well it just happend now when i use the new jquery and jq mobile
[05:58:03] <aaronmcadam> splice
[05:58:09] <aaronmcadam> ?mdn splice
[05:58:17] <aaronmcadam> fuckin bot is down
[05:58:30] <aaronmcadam> stenno, you want splice
[05:58:36] <stenno> i don't want it :)
[05:58:43] <stenno> just made a mistake :P
[05:58:58] <aaronmcadam> ah kk
[05:59:05] <reypa> i don't split anything in there
[05:59:26] <reypa> i jsut have a list and now with new jquery and jqm this error appears, pretty strange
[05:59:28] <stenno> reypa, what does the stacktrace say?
[05:59:53] <Segaja> aaronmcadam: i meant for the users on my page... something like woltlab uses in the burning board 3
[06:00:32] <reypa> nothing. i just see this error on my js error log, and nothing happens
[06:01:41] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[06:01:48] <reypa> wanna see it online?
[06:01:49] <aaronmcadam> wrong person Segaja ?
[06:02:03] <stenno> hmm, in chrome you get a nice stacktrace, i guess b.split comes from jquery or jqm(whatever that is), but without stacktrace you can't quite see where it comes from
[06:02:08] <stenno> reypa, sure
[06:02:30] <reypa> oh wait' ill have to jion the other network, i^ll be back in 2 min.
[06:02:33] <stenno> :)
[06:02:39] <aaronmcadam> reypa
[06:02:49] <aaronmcadam> I've seen that before I'm workin on a jqm project
[06:03:16] <aaronmcadam> stenno, jqm refers to jq mobile
[06:03:26] <stenno> ah
[06:03:32] <aaronmcadam> yip
[06:03:46] <aaronmcadam> I've seen a couple of errors like that
[06:03:53] <aaronmcadam> usually down to doing something silly
[06:04:13] <aaronmcadam> usually the way when errors are thrown from jquery
[06:04:29] <Segaja> aaronmcadam: no. 14:57:00 < aaronmcadam> ?g dreamweaver @ Segaja
[06:05:00] <aaronmcadam> ah k
[06:05:07] <aaronmcadam> why do u need WYSIWYG anyway
[06:05:12] <aaronmcadam> that's for pussies :P
[06:05:18] <reypa_> hi
[06:05:22] <Segaja> because the users want it
[06:05:26] <Segaja> i'm just the dev..
[06:05:31] <aaronmcadam> what users?
[06:05:32] <Skizu> Anyone know PDO o:?
[06:05:33] <reypa_> sorry i cant deploy and join IRC at the same time at work
[06:05:35] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:05:40] <reypa_> stenno, mobitest.coop.ch
[06:05:41] <aaronmcadam> PHP Database Object, Skizu
[06:05:48] <stenno> the users want wysiwyg editors...?
[06:05:55] <stenno> reypa_, let me check it out
[06:05:57] <aaronmcadam> it's part of proper transactional MySQL in php
[06:06:00] <reypa_> then you have to search for a place and hit the search button, then check the list
[06:06:08] <Segaja> aaronmcadam: the users of the page
[06:06:13] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[06:06:17] <aaronmcadam> oh
[06:06:18] <aaronmcadam> kk
[06:06:27] <aaronmcadam> bespin was cool
[06:06:31] <aaronmcadam> it's been renamed now
[06:06:36] <reypa_> stenno, every list element should link to an other div wirh page role, it worked with 4.1
[06:06:40] <Skizu> aaronmcadam: I wasnt asking what it was i was asking if you knew what it is xD
[06:06:43] <aaronmcadam> do you mean some like see ?g ckeditor
[06:06:55] <aaronmcadam> yeah sorry Skizu i just realised that hah
[06:07:05] <Skizu> Lol
[06:07:13] <aaronmcadam> hang on that's the same question
[06:07:19] <Skizu> $stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, `logintime`, NOW()) AS `timeDiff`, `count` FROM `users` WHERE `email`=:email");
[06:07:20] <aaronmcadam> what is was/what it is?
[06:07:21] <stenno> reypa_, uh
[06:07:21] <Skizu> This fks up lol
[06:07:22] <aaronmcadam> wtF?
[06:07:35] <reypa> stenno, ?
[06:07:37] <stenno> reypa_, this bug seems to come from jqm/jquery directly
[06:07:51] <aaronmcadam> stenno invariably that's not the case
[06:07:54] <aaronmcadam> it's his code
[06:08:03] <Skizu> Can you see anything directly which would mess up when you execute this ?
[06:08:06] <stenno> reypa, following the stacktrace, your code is not involved in it
[06:08:09] <aaronmcadam> errors that "seem to come" from jq aren't errors in jquery
[06:08:29] <stenno> aaronmcadam, let me paste the trace...
[06:08:37] <aaronmcadam> you just need to recheck your code, you're doing something wrong elsewhere
[06:08:41] <reypa> thats why i don't know what to do ;-)
[06:08:48] <reypa> well it worked well with alpha 4.1
[06:08:48] <aaronmcadam> I've never looked at a js stacktrace
[06:08:59] <aaronmcadam> are u on .latest?
[06:09:01] <aaronmcadam> or b1?
[06:09:17] <reypa> now i updatet to beta
[06:09:19] <aaronmcadam> step through it with firebug
[06:09:27] <seutje> aaronmcadam: iono, seems more useful as a bookmarklet, so I don't need access to the backend and I can't accidentally commit debug shizzle like this
[06:09:29] <aaronmcadam> are you using the API
[06:09:48] <aaronmcadam> kk
[06:09:54] <seutje> and even if I used firebug and disabled cache, that would still require me to refresh, no?
[06:09:59] <reypa> did you see it? mobitest.coop.ch on the list page after you searched a place
[06:10:05] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[06:10:14] <aaronmcadam> course it would seutje
[06:10:23] <seutje> that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid :P
[06:10:30] <aaronmcadam> reypa how much custom js are u using
[06:10:32] <seutje> like I said, slow ass backend
[06:10:35] <aaronmcadam> there could be breaking changes
[06:10:51] <reypa> on the Liste site few
[06:10:55] <aaronmcadam> seutje, cache bursting forces a reload, it's still gonna hit ur site
[06:11:03] <aaronmcadam> I don't understand
[06:11:25] <reypa> just some struts and a counter
[06:11:47] <seutje> aaronmcadam: changing the query string will cause it to reload the static file as if it was a new file, the page content doesn't get re-rendered and the database doesn't get hit
[06:11:50] <stenno> reypa, aaronmcadam this is what i got https://gist.github.com/1069467
[06:12:23] <aaronmcadam> that shit is never useful
[06:12:30] <aaronmcadam> firebug
[06:12:30] <stenno> i think it is
[06:12:34] <aaronmcadam> breakpoints
[06:12:36] <stenno> its not firebug
[06:12:37] <reypa> stenno, okay
[06:12:47] <aaronmcadam> put breakpoints in reypa and debug it
[06:12:53] <aaronmcadam> step through each line
[06:12:57] <aaronmcadam> until it breaks
[06:13:09] <reypa> how? it's the code i get from jquery
[06:13:14] <seutje> for debugging purposes, u might wanna use an unminified version
[06:13:54] <aaronmcadam> there's no need to read the actual source
[06:13:56] <reypa> but i don't wanna change something in the jquery code... or what do you mean?
[06:14:02] <aaronmcadam> nevermind reypa
[06:14:10] <aaronmcadam> use firebug and put in breakpoints like i said
[06:14:15] <aaronmcadam> don't waste time in the jquery source
[06:14:27] <muzone> whats the jquery way of doing text input placeholders (ditching labels)? i.e. for "search...", "enter email..." etc.
[06:14:37] <aaronmcadam> infield plugin
[06:14:44] <reypa> but the error is there? thats what the concole says
[06:14:51] <reypa> *console
[06:14:53] <aaronmcadam> yes, for god's sake
[06:14:53] <BlaDe> console.log(list) shows object ---> 3 objects but list.length is undefined
[06:14:56] <BlaDe> why is that?
[06:15:02] <aaronmcadam> it's NOT an error in jquery!
[06:15:09] <BlaDe> Object != Array?
[06:16:08] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6611188/mouse-remains-focused-on-object-even-when-it-is-removed
[06:16:26] <aaronmcadam> christ
[06:16:45] <aaronmcadam> can't even be arsed to explain ur question, just a paste from SO? amazing
[06:17:20] <BlaDe> any ideas on mine ? :<
[06:17:35] <aaronmcadam> ?eval new Object() === new Array()
[06:17:42] <muzone> thanks aaronmcadam
[06:17:49] <aaronmcadam> np
[06:18:05] <aaronmcadam> ?botttt
[06:18:07] <aaronmcadam> wake up!
[06:18:12] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam i'd believe you if you just said 'no'
[06:18:19] <aaronmcadam> I was checking
[06:18:26] <BlaDe> okay
[06:18:27] <aaronmcadam> but yea there's no obj.length
[06:18:32] <aaronmcadam> it's not an array
[06:18:40] <BlaDe> new Object() == new Array()
[06:18:40] <BlaDe> false
[06:18:51] <BlaDe> why am I getting an object returned? it's a json array
[06:19:05] <aaronmcadam> are you sure
[06:19:10] <aaronmcadam> did u parse it?
[06:19:13] <BlaDe> i made the array
[06:19:19] <BlaDe> and then did a json_encode( ), so yeah i'm pretty sure
[06:19:23] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle
[06:19:25] <aaronmcadam> that's php
[06:19:39] <aaronmcadam> and it's json_decode() for parsing
[06:19:51] <BlaDe> sure - but I can't query mysql from js so I need some php
[06:19:55] <aaronmcadam> put ur code up somewhere
[06:20:05] <aaronmcadam> how are u getting the json
[06:20:08] <BlaDe> sec
[06:20:31] <BlaDe> http://pastie.org/private/x7fawflomczh7fi6hpkvw
[06:21:01] <aaronmcadam> yep
[06:21:04] <aaronmcadam> you're doing it wrong
[06:21:10] <BlaDe> i figured ;)
[06:21:15] <aaronmcadam> wrap that in $.parseJSON
[06:21:20] <aaronmcadam> before the <?
[06:21:35] <BlaDe> ok hold on let me try that
[06:21:46] <aaronmcadam> var folders = $.parseJSON( <?=json_encode($folderTree); ?>; );
[06:21:53] <BlaDe> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null
[06:21:53] <aaronmcadam> BlaDe ^^
[06:21:58] <BlaDe> from undefined to null :D
[06:22:04] <aaronmcadam> log out folders first
[06:22:18] <aaronmcadam> quotes too
[06:22:23] <jbrokc> is it possible to add the css :hover property to something that's not currently being hovered in jquery?
[06:22:54] <aaronmcadam> var folders = $.parseJSON( ' <?=json_encode($folderTree); ?> ' );
[06:23:12] <aaronmcadam> wait a minute
[06:23:21] <BlaDe> folders is null now, aaronmcadam
[06:23:22] <aaronmcadam> is $folderTree an array?
[06:23:26] <BlaDe> yes
[06:23:35] <aaronmcadam> just a flat one/ assoc?
[06:23:39] <aaronmcadam> or*
[06:23:49] <doncams> hello
[06:23:49] <BlaDe> sec
[06:24:24] <AxonetBE> Can somebody say me why this : http://pastie.org/2177540 is not working in IE7 with jquery 1.5.1, he disable the button but doesn't submit the form anymore
[06:25:44] <sukima> The number of it doesn't work in IE[6-9] questions here is staggering
[06:26:05] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam output is: http://pastie.org/private/uv2h95rbulge3n5mb9ksa
[06:26:20] <BlaDe> ah no quotes
[06:26:24] <aaronmcadam> yep
[06:26:25] <kojiro> my javascript code doesn't work in Notepad.
[06:26:33] <AxonetBE> sukima: is it to me?
[06:26:44] <aaronmcadam> or .toString() might work BlaDe
[06:26:46] <sukima> AxonetBE: general observation
[06:26:46] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam ok now my code doesn't work at all, but there's no errors from that
[06:27:05] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[06:27:06] <sukima> kojiro: Since when did notepad have a javascript interperator?
[06:27:09] <lil-murph> Can I select text via javascript? (select as in like you would with the mouse)? I want to select all the text in a table cell automatically so the user can hit ctrl+c and copy it easily.
[06:27:24] <kojiro> sukima: it doesn't. I think that's the problem.
[06:27:33] <aaronmcadam> I don't get why
[06:27:39] <sukima> kojiro: LOL!
[06:27:59] <aaronmcadam> lil-murph, yes, you can fire selected()
[06:28:11] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam exact same problem as before
[06:28:19] <BlaDe> it returns an object, and there's no object.length
[06:28:25] <aaronmcadam> paste it again
[06:28:32] <BlaDe> http://pastie.org/private/x7fawflomczh7fi6hpkvw <- same paste
[06:28:42] <BlaDe> only difference is: var folders = $.parseJSON('<?=json_encode($folderTree); ?>');
[06:29:15] <aaronmcadam> well make the difference then
[06:29:30] <BlaDe> done
[06:29:50] <BlaDe> http://pastie.org/private/x7fawflomczh7fi6hpkvw
[06:30:14] <aaronmcadam> $.parseJSON( '{ "this" : "that" }' );
[06:30:18] <aaronmcadam> Object { this="that"}
[06:30:32] <BlaDe> sorry, so what am I doing wrong?
[06:30:56] <Skizu> Anyone here know php and pdo?
[06:31:11] <BlaDe> Skizu sure, but #php people do too
[06:31:16] <aaronmcadam> var t = $.parseJSON( '[{ "this" : "that" }, {"that" : "this"}]' );
[06:31:22] <aaronmcadam> t.length
[06:31:22] <aaronmcadam> 2
[06:31:27] <aaronmcadam> t
[06:31:28] <aaronmcadam> [Object { this="that"}, Object { that="this"}]
[06:31:44] <BlaDe> so is my php array wrong or something..?
[06:31:53] <BlaDe> http://pastie.org/private/x7fawflomczh7fi6hpkvw <- the array
[06:31:55] <aaronmcadam> hang on
[06:32:05] <lil-murph> aaronmcadam, how to fire selected? I tried $('td').click(function(e){ $(this).selected(); }); but that wasn't it. And google fails do to all the results being about selectors
[06:32:23] <aaronmcadam> wrong pastie BlaDe
[06:32:40] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam it is?
[06:32:43] <aaronmcadam> yep
[06:32:54] <BlaDe> fixed, added the quotes ;)
[06:32:56] <aaronmcadam> if you just have a proper flat array and encode that
[06:33:00] <aaronmcadam> what's the link
[06:33:05] <__ch_ri_s> hello =) anny developers/administrators from jqueryui.com here?
[06:33:09] <BlaDe> you want to see the php array/
[06:33:13] <aaronmcadam> yea
[06:33:33] <__ch_ri_s> i've found a bug in the website itself, but don't know where to report it..
[06:33:44] <sukima> BlaDe: Does your PHP expand to include quotes? if that isn't escaped properly you could run into big problems
[06:33:56] <aaronmcadam> #jqueryui-dev  _chr_ri_s
[06:34:15] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam, sukima; http://pastie.org/private/oilhrcbn7zhgcly3zsucgw
[06:34:18] <aaronmcadam> the json_encode func should sort that
[06:34:25] <aaronmcadam> sukima
[06:34:42] <__ch_ri_s> thanks aaronmcadam
[06:35:00] <aaronmcadam> ok
[06:35:12] <aaronmcadam> that array looks fucked up
[06:35:21] <aaronmcadam> is that from a simpleXML object or something
[06:35:29] <BlaDe> no it's built from php
[06:35:38] <aaronmcadam> simpleXML is a php module dummy
[06:35:43] <BlaDe> sure, but I mean my php
[06:35:44] <aaronmcadam> :P
[06:35:59] <BlaDe> it's a tree of folders basically... I can give it in a flat array too but I thought this would be easier
[06:36:14] <aaronmcadam> well
[06:36:17] <aaronmcadam> go to jsonlint
[06:36:31] <aaronmcadam> and paste in the result of json_encode( $folders)
[06:36:34] <aaronmcadam> make sure it's well formed
[06:36:40] <BlaDe> i don't doubt it is
[06:36:49] <aaronmcadam> just check
[06:36:49] <BlaDe> .parseJSON would probably error otherwise, anyway.. but I trust json_encode
[06:36:55] <aaronmcadam> i do too
[06:36:55] <BlaDe> on.. sec
[06:36:56] <BlaDe> ok*
[06:36:58] <aaronmcadam> but just check it
[06:37:11] <BlaDe> Results: Valid JSON
[06:37:15] <aaronmcadam> good
[06:37:23] <aaronmcadam> now set that as a variable
[06:37:30] <BlaDe> static?
[06:37:32] <aaronmcadam> put 2 quotes either side
[06:37:35] <aaronmcadam> yea just for now
[06:37:38] <sukima> BlaDe: Can you pastie the JSON output from that data?
[06:37:38] <BlaDe> k
[06:37:46] <BlaDe> sukima: http://pastie.org/private/uv2h95rbulge3n5mb9ksa
[06:37:52] <aaronmcadam> BlaDe
[06:38:00] <aaronmcadam> put two single quotes round it
[06:38:12] <BlaDe> done
[06:38:12] <seutje> aaronmcadam: btw, the weird shit is that if I paste the bookmarklet in my console, it doesn't crash
[06:38:23] <aaronmcadam> god know
[06:38:34] <aaronmcadam> if paul_irish was around he might be able to help
[06:38:41] <aaronmcadam> cool
[06:38:53] <aaronmcadam> now what does $.parseJSON( variable ) give u
[06:38:54] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam probably eaiser if we put this in a jsbin
[06:38:57] <aaronmcadam> when u log it out
[06:38:57] <BlaDe> hold on
[06:39:03] <aaronmcadam> use jsfiddle BlaDe
[06:39:05] <aaronmcadam> plz
[06:39:15] <BlaDe> yeah sorry that's what i meant
[06:39:19] <aaronmcadam> cool
[06:40:47] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/jmWbM/
[06:41:29] <aaronmcadam> eesh blaDe i was expecting just the json haha
[06:41:31] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[06:41:32] <topcat__> How do I call my own function from within a jquery plugin method ?
[06:42:13] * geekbuntu ...dial 001+the number
[06:42:15] <aaronmcadam> it's working for me BlaDe
[06:42:30] <BlaDe> really?
[06:42:38] <geekbuntu> topcat__, if the function is defined - just call it
[06:42:56] <BlaDe> try this one, this is more closely what it should do but i've hard coded the list = folders: http://jsfiddle.net/ecXuc/
[06:43:01] <BlaDe> @ aaronmcadam
[06:43:05] <geekbuntu> function1(){....           function2(){ function1(); }
[06:43:20] <topcat__> geekbuntu well I'm getting undefined errors for it
[06:43:23] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/jmWbM/1/ @ BlaDe
[06:43:30] <aaronmcadam> you must be iterating over it wrong
[06:43:54] <aaronmcadam> [Object { 0=0, 1="Default", more...}, Object { 0="736821", 1="test", more...}, Object { 0="736827", 1="testing", more...}] , length: 3
[06:43:57] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam yes that bit works
[06:44:11] <BlaDe> but as soon as I move it to say folders[1]['children'] it doesn't
[06:44:12] <aaronmcadam> kk well u got that far anyway
[06:44:28] <BlaDe> yeah that bit has always worked, even without parseJSON
[06:44:37] <BlaDe> http://jsfiddle.net/ecXuc/ <- try that -- that works a little
[06:44:41] <aaronmcadam> u never mentioned that part ....
[06:45:21] <aaronmcadam> i don't have time right now to get more involved lol already wasted 10 mins helpin u when you'd already sorted that
[06:45:35] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam i explained the problem earlier
[06:45:44] <aaronmcadam> nevermind its k
[06:47:01] <geekbuntu> BlaDe, that's cool - is that up anywhere/see it in action?
[06:47:38] <geekbuntu> topcat__, do you have it pasted in a fiddle?
[06:47:42] <geekbuntu> would help a lot
[06:48:01] <topcat__>  geekbuntu  : I'm trying to find somewhere, pastebin was down. I'll fiddle it
[06:48:31] <sukima> ?jsfiddle
[06:48:44] <sukima> !jsfiddle
[06:49:08] <geekbuntu> topcat__, fiddle is better for here (IMHO)

[06:54:20] <Armern> Hey guys, something not really jquery related but hopefully someone can help me.. I can't seem to find anything on the web about this. Say I have this var a = new Array; a[3]=1;, then a.length will return 4.. Is there any way to actually get it so that a.length returns 1 instead (but preferably without using a.push(1))
[06:55:31] <geekbuntu> topcat__, looking
[06:55:53] <masdns> hi, some speak spanish?
[06:56:04] <mytoz> this is embarrassing, and I have no clue why, but no delegate event fires at all in my page.
[06:56:12] <aaronmcadam> Armern, don't use new Array() for a start
[06:56:15] <mytoz> no errors in firebug, but they don't fire.
[06:56:38] <mytoz> I tried: $( document.body ).delegate( "div", "click", someEvent ) but nothing happens.
[06:56:39] <geekbuntu> no habla
[06:56:40] <kborchers> __ch_ri_s: you could try him via twitter @rworth
[06:56:46] <aaronmcadam> why do u want gaps in your array Armern
[06:56:52] <mytoz> tried mouseover, mouseup etc.
[06:56:52] <Armern> aaronmcadam, ah okay
[06:57:01] <geekbuntu> topcat__, what is supposed to happen/not happen
[06:57:07] <aaronmcadam> an array is what it is, an ordered list of items
[06:57:36] <aaronmcadam> there is a pattern to reindex an array
[06:57:43] <aaronmcadam> but why are you doing a[3] = 1?
[06:58:06] <JAAulde> kborchers: ping
[06:58:20] <Armern> aaronmcadam, well I'd like to store positions, and relate them to an id. I could of course use push and then use a multidimensional array like a.push({id: 1, posx: 3}), but for my current code it would've been handier to use it in the other way
[06:58:49] <aaronmcadam> no, an object literal is the best way
[06:59:04] <aaronmcadam> otherwise you'll be doing lots of inefficient shit
[06:59:11] <kborchers> JAAulde: hey
[06:59:24] <aaronmcadam> why don't you map it like this
[06:59:33] <Xeon06_> Hey guys
[06:59:34] <aaronmcadam> { 1 : 3, 2 : 4, 3 : 6 }
[06:59:48] <Xeon06_> Can anyone link me to a good page for understanding deferred objects and their use?
[07:00:00] <aaronmcadam> then u could do $.each ( literal, function( index, value ) { value[index] }
[07:00:01] <mytoz> found the reason: validation plugin overwrites the .delegate function.
[07:00:06] <JAAulde> kborchers: g'morning! A coworker and I did a TON of debugging and tracing and found the issue with the draggable crashing IE7. It happens when a draggable resides in a UI Tab. Simplest reproduction: http://jsfiddle.net/JAAulde/7fxmu/
[07:00:10] <aaronmcadam> couldn't do surely??
[07:00:18] <JAAulde> kborchers: So I am opening a bug now
[07:00:56] <Armern> aaronmcadam, sounds like that might work, I'll look into it! Thanks man :)
[07:01:10] <aaronmcadam> no prob Armern, u follow what i mean yeah?
[07:01:31] <stenno> reypa, anything new?
[07:01:35] <iEatChildren> can anyone assist me with jquery mobile? I have  a page http://somesite.com/index.php. You hit submit and it slides in the next form (http://somesite.com/index.php#/page2.php. When i hit submit on the second page nothing happens but If i browse straight to http://somesite.com/page2.php the button works
[07:01:37] <stenno> ah he is not even online anymore
[07:01:40] <Armern> yeah, I just looked up the object literal on google and so far as I can tell it's indeed much easier that way
[07:01:49] <aaronmcadam> cool dude
[07:03:02] <topcat__> geekbuntu : ok it's been working in the past but now I'm trying to use methods and such. it all runs bar when it hits if ( ! isSliding) in the middle. I get function not defined. How am I supposed to do it ?
[07:03:14] <aaronmcadam> iEatChildren, #jquerymobile, i'm there too
[07:03:29] <monk12> hello all, quick question... I am trying to get the jquery UI Today button working so it auto-sets the Today date in the textfield instead of the default functionality (which is just to goto the date in the control)...
[07:04:58] <monk12> it works in FF, http://jsfiddle.net/VSvSC/3/ but in IE, it seems to bring up the control again after i blur out of it (all code copied from a solution on internet, i just added blur(), since FF didn't re-bring up the datepicker if i clicked the textfield unless i blurred off it).
[07:07:34] <Pitel> I have a little problem... I have dynamic table (meaning, it's filled with ajax data), and at the last column are "links" to eg. delete the item on the row using $("table").delegate("a.delete", "click", function()). also, every row has $("table tr").live(function()) (older code, so live instead fo delegate) handler to display details about the item in that row. now, when I click the delete link, both these handlers are triggered! but i
[07:07:34] <Pitel> don't want that. what can i do? I read a note at live and delegate documentation, that I can't stop event propagation on them. so, now what?
[07:07:42] <PrinceES> Having syntax error therefore cant retrieve my data through XML on js slider .... please have a look on here ... http://pastebin.com/k7qjrbb4
[07:08:35] <ajpiano> Pitel: check the target of the evnet in the live handler, and make sure it's not an "a"
[07:09:02] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam here?
[07:09:11] <Pitel> ajpiano: oh, that didn;t come to my mind. thank you.
[07:09:50] <BlaDe> here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jmWbM/7/
[07:10:08] <BlaDe> it's mostly working, but if you go test -> a  there should be 3 a's, it only shows 1... any ideas why?
[07:10:09] <PrinceES> please help me :(
[07:10:57] <PrinceES> i define all my jquery code inside the php class .... which doesnt seems to work  http://pastebin.com/k7qjrbb4
[07:11:22] <stenno> PrinceES, #php
[07:11:27] <PrinceES> no...
[07:11:32] <PrinceES> it is not related with PHP
[07:11:41] <PrinceES> it is something wrong on my jquery code
[07:12:00] <monk12> PrinceES, use php HEREDOC syntax. easier to rewrite
[07:12:05] <PrinceES> and i just need to know which is the main problem which wouldnt let me to fetch xml data on
[07:12:23] <stenno> does parseXML gets called?
[07:12:36] <monk12> Do you get a syntax error?
[07:12:37] <stenno> -s
[07:12:45] <smplstk> PrinceES: if it's something to do with the jQuery code, why are you showing us PHP?
[07:13:10] <smplstk> PrinceES: we juts care about the stuff inside the <script> tags :)
[07:13:44] <BlaDe> any ideas about my issue guys?
[07:13:50] <PrinceES> here you can see rendered code...
[07:13:52] <PrinceES> http://pastebin.com/CX6MhJAL
[07:14:07] <sukima> smplstk: I've noticed that most problems are coming from outside jQuery and/or IE related. funny how that is.
[07:14:38] <sukima> PrinceES: LOL good luck with that! ouch!
[07:16:48] <aaronmcadam> BlaDe, yeah
[07:19:02] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam, do you midn taking another look? it's getting really close :)
[07:19:15] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/jmWbM/7/
[07:19:31] <BlaDe> if you goto test -> a there should be 3 a's in there, there's only 1
[07:19:31] <Armern> aaronmcadam, just to come back on the object literal subject, all is pretty much fine, however I could really still use a length equivalent functionality... do you know if that's possible?
[07:19:52] <BlaDe> 36821":{"0":"736821","1":"test","2":0,"children":{"736823":{"0":"736823","1":"a","2":"736821","children":{"736824":{"0":"736824","1":"a","2":"736823","children":[]},"736825":{"0":"736825","1":"a","2":"736823","children":[]},"736826":{"0":"736826","1":"a","2":"736823","children":[]}}}}
[07:19:58] <BlaDe> as you can see, a little hard to read, but test -> a -> 3 a's
[07:20:56] <monk12> Is my question more jquery-ui, should i ask in there as i guess its more UI related?
[07:21:37] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:21:43] <aaronmcadam> .length should work
[07:21:45] <aaronmcadam> ?eval
[07:21:46] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[07:22:03] <aaronmcadam> ?eval { a : 1, b : 2, c : 3 }.length

[07:22:08] <aaronmcadam> cock

[07:22:17] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: invalid label
[07:22:18] <reypa> hi
[07:22:35] <reypa> aaronmcadam, you remeber helped me?
[07:22:38] <reypa> i solved it
[07:22:41] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var obj = { 1 : 1, 2 : 2, 3 : 3 }; obj.length
[07:22:41] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: undefined
[07:22:44] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var obj = { 1 : 1, 2 : 2, 3 : 3 }; obj
[07:22:45] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: {"1": 1, "2": 2, "3": 3}
[07:23:22] <Armern> lol sweet, a debugging bot XD
[07:23:24] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam i'm past the .length problem now
[07:23:46] <PrinceES> <sukima> cant you help me out?
[07:24:10] <aaronmcadam> wasn't talking to u BlaDe
[07:24:28] <BlaDe> ah right
[07:24:33] <BlaDe> do you mind taking another look at my problem?
[07:25:09] <aaronmcadam> bit busy right now
[07:25:26] <aaronmcadam> what r u doing now
[07:25:40] <PrinceES> i define all my jquery code inside the php class .... which doesnt seems to work  http://pastebin.com/k7qjrbb4
[07:26:39] <stenno> reypa, did you fix it?
[07:26:47] <stenno> was it a problem in your code?
[07:26:47] <reypa> yeah
[07:26:52] <reypa> yeah =(
[07:27:04] <aaronmcadam> told ya reypa
[07:27:06] <monk12> PrinceES, why not just define all your code in an external .js file and include that in your php file?
[07:27:26] <reypa> i gave the page's an id in struts, and it where numbers, so it didn't work, now i put an "a" in fornt of it and now it works
[07:27:26] <monk12> Are you actually using a variable in your php in your js? if not make it less messy
[07:27:33] <Armern> aaronmcadam, I think I may just do it manually otherwise, using a defined function. It's not as neat as I would've liked it but I think it'll work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5533192/how-to-get-object-length-in-jquery (2nd answer) so I won't spam you with questions, hehe. You're very kind for helping btw! Thanks :D
[07:27:47] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[07:28:15] <JAAulde> kborchers: Bug opened: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7538
[07:28:35] <kborchers> JAAulde: cool, thanks
[07:28:59] <JAAulde> kborchers: no prob, just wanted to follow up and let you know we got somewhere :)
[07:29:26] <monk12> PrinceES:  and if you ARE using server vars in js, still externalize the messy JS and put any php vars needed in JS on a global variable like: var global_holder = { some_server_variable: <?php echo $blah; ?>  }; not sure if thats standard, but Ive use that
[07:29:36] <kborchers> JAAulde: glad you found a reproducable example.
[07:29:56] <sukima> PrinceES: I can't help yo I'd loose my brain coding like that. I would recommend pulling the JS out of PHP into a seperate file that has PHP includes instead. You should be looking at that code as more of a template then on huge string.
[07:29:58] <JAAulde> kborchers: omg, me too. only took me 3 days, and a co worker a day and a half
[07:30:07] <reypa> stenno, aaronmcadam, thanks for helping bye!
[07:30:25] <JAAulde> one expensive problem! it is crippling a feature of our product for a large set of customers so we had to stay on it!
[07:33:21] <muzone> Is this syntax valid? $(document).ready(function(){ $("#search label, #newsletter label").inFieldLabels(); });
[07:33:51] <muzone> Or must it be split up into $("#search label").inFieldLabels(); and $("#newsletter label").inFieldLabels();?
[07:33:59] <muzone> aaronmcadam: any idea?
[07:34:33] <sukima> muzone: I think the first one is ok. Testit in jsfiddle
[07:35:08] <muzone> thanks sukima
[07:36:59] <kborchers> JAAulde: well, i think i may know part of your issue. jQuery UI does not support jQuery 1.6.1 or 1.6.2 yet. if you change your fiddle to use 1.5.2 and then add ui 1.8.14 via the resources, it works fine in IE7
[07:37:12] <aaronmcadam> muzone
[07:37:19] <JAAulde> kborchers: ahhhh, crap
[07:37:23] <aaronmcadam> muzone, add a class and call that
[07:37:32] <geekbuntu> i was looking at topcat__ 's paste - i can't see any 'code problem' can someone else have a look?  http://jsfiddle.net/Ysgd7/3/
[07:37:52] <JAAulde> kborchers: I did see that switching to jQ 1.5.2 and UI 1.8.9 fixed it
[07:38:02] <ldexterldesign> sup guys
[07:38:11] <ldexterldesign> i'm trying to count the number of list items in a ul
[07:38:17] <topcat__> Why am I getting .isSliding undefined - http://jsfiddle.net/Ysgd7/3/ - How am I supposed to call the function or method if it's supossed to be that
[07:38:19] <kborchers> JAAulde: your bug report will be helpful though as 1.6.1 support is coming soon and the team needs to know things that could happen in the upgrade
[07:38:29] <ldexterldesign> size() is throwing a total accounting for all the list items on the page
[07:38:51] <ajpiano> ldexterldesign $("#someUL > li").length
[07:39:05] <JAAulde> kborchers: I am kind of effed right now then...crap
[07:39:07] <topcat__> I also don't see why jslint complains about this - Problem at line 73 character 38: Missing semicolon. return settings.state = '-100%';
[07:39:30] <JAAulde> We had to upgrade to jQ 1.6.1 as it fixed another major IE issue
[07:39:44] <kborchers> JAAulde
[07:39:47] <kborchers> ouch
[07:40:01] <JAAulde> mother effin' IE
[07:41:05] <kborchers> JAAulde: I just commented on your bug. Gotta love IE ... especially 7. I think it causes more headaches than 6
[07:41:44] <JAAulde> kborchers: yep, saw the comment. OMG I am in a bind. ok, time to talk to the powers that be.  Thanks for your time!
[07:42:07] <kborchers> np
[07:42:22] <BlaDe> IE7 is definitely a pain
[07:42:41] <ThiefMaster|work> is there any way to get my mouseenter events to fire on a disabled ui button?
[07:42:50] <ThiefMaster|work> i'd like to show a tooltip explaining why the button is disabled
[07:44:42] <JAAulde> kborchers: I guess I will be running a hacked jQ core until this is resolved... makes Jimmy sad
[07:45:30] <kborchers> JAAulde: yeah, you hate to do that but sometimes it's the lesser of two evils when you need the upgrade to fix other bugs. :(
[07:45:55] <BlaDe> can anyone take a look at this to see why it isn't working right? http://jsfiddle.net/jmWbM/8/
[07:46:08] <BlaDe> if I goto Test -> A there should be 3a's it only shows 1
[07:46:18] <BlaDe> it doesn't seem to like going depeer than 1 level in the array but I can't figure out why
[07:48:29] <BlaDe> uhh http://jsfiddle.net/jmWbM/9/ sorry :)
[07:49:27] <BlaDe> still wrong. This one is the one for sure lol: http://jsfiddle.net/PqC3K/
[07:52:03] <muzone> aaronmcadam: good idea
[07:52:28] <SpaceghostC2C> The api is down I think. D:
[07:52:47] <SpaceghostC2C> Crap and I was just learning to use delegate instead of live.

[07:53:26] <ajpiano> SpaceghostC2C: it seems to be fine for me, if a bit slo

[07:56:52] <BlaDe> geekbuntu how can the results vary from static json code?
[07:56:56] <djQuery> anyone see anything wrong with that?
[07:57:22] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/25/edit  it is actualy not parsing the child template at all now
[07:57:34] <geekbuntu> BlaDe, i just pasted in the data from your last paste - just told you what it said
[07:57:39] <geekbuntu> nothing more
[07:58:01] <BlaDe> geekbuntu I think you must've copied/pasted wrong or something.. try again :-)
[07:58:05] <stenno> hmm, when i use .animate on two different jquery selectors, can i expect them to run asynchronous?

[07:59:38] <Rushing> looks like the starts of a pretty nifty data editor djQuery
[08:00:33] <djQuery> Rushing: thats the idea to be able to design and share data structures and have it output based on choosen sql\programing language
[08:00:55] <stenno> so if do $(elem1).animate(duration: 3000); $(elem2).animate(duration:3000); can i expect them to start and finish (nearly) at the same time?
[08:01:01] <djQuery> if I can ever get it to show the data struct in the first place
[08:01:25] <doncams> little help. my google-fu fails me once again. any good read bout jquery and how to avoid memory leaks?
[08:01:33] <Rushing> i've not worked with jquery templates yet...looks interesting, but i find it simple enough to just generate the template
[08:01:40] <Lothar> hi all
[08:02:08] <djQuery> stenno: about the same. but you may have an easier time doing $('#elm1, #elm2').animate
[08:02:13] <muzone> aaronmcadam: Any idea why my in-field won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/HCx9y/
[08:02:16] <Lothar> i have problem with jquery and IE 8 --> http://pastebin.com/cFzyeib8
[08:02:33] <muzone> * in-field label
[08:02:34] <Rushing> djQuery, maybe you should consider a field framework that uses the widgets factory so each field has states, and then custom field types could be created and assigned to the schema
[08:02:44] <stenno> djQuery, thanks!
[08:02:54] <Rushing> then the field widget would be responsible for creating its own html
[08:04:08] <muzone> I'm trying to use the In-field Labels plugin - http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/ - any idea why it won't work though? http://jsfiddle.net/HCx9y/
[08:04:21] <Rushing> i've had something in the works for over a year now that is too complex for me to get done lol...it uses that concept, but the schema model is very heavy
[08:04:26] <Lothar> nobody have same problem ?
[08:04:28] <djQuery> Rushing: the problem with custom datatypes is this is supposed to let a ms sql guy design a datastructure then have a mysql guy output the create table commands
[08:04:46] <Rushing> right, so you have default widgets for certain data types
[08:05:09] <Rushing> but then you could have a js guy come in and fancy the form up a bit, if time/budget allows
[08:05:17] <djQuery> Rushing: so I have to create a map that says if dttype=x and outputtype=y then format z
[08:05:26] <Rushing> basically
[08:05:30] <reypa> lothar, do you have that on english?
[08:05:45] <djQuery> Rushing: BUDGET? js guy?
[08:05:50] <djQuery> lol
[08:06:04] <Rushing> then some kind of override script that could interject that schema object and assign a different data type for a different field
[08:06:44] <Lothar> ?
[08:06:45] <djQuery> muzone: why not just use placeholders. <input type="email" placeholder="Your email address">
[08:06:59] <djQuery> muzone: there are plenty of place holder plugins
[08:09:10] <muzone> djQuery: I was told by the guys in #html to not use placeholders for this !!
[08:09:45] <djQuery> muzone: and it was because ur input didnt have an id so the for= of the label didnt realy do anything
[08:10:06] <Lothar> anyone know anything about the error 80020101 in IE 8 ?
[08:10:20] <Lothar> with jquery
[08:10:31] <djQuery> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HCx9y/1/
[08:10:44] <muzone> riiight!
[08:10:47] <Lothar> this error is on jquery.js file
[08:10:53] <muzone> damn, i put the id on the button instead - my bad
[08:11:20] <reypa> lothar, do you have more information?
[08:12:07] <djQuery> so no insight from anyone on how to get the child row index in templates? http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/26/edit
[08:12:43] <djQuery> or why this isnt working in the child template but works fine in the parent? <tbody>{{tmpl(Columns, { getIndex: function(item){return $.inArray(item, Columns);}}) "#coltmpl"}}</tbody>
[08:14:31] <orolo> i want to preventDefault() for a click if an DOM object has a class.
[08:15:01] <orolo> disable a click based on a class, i guess; how would one do that?
[08:16:44] <Lothar> when I load my page, I have a menu, this menu is composed of linked type <li> <a href='action.php'> <li> link, so the action.php loads and the return of page, some component jquery is not enabled because IE 8.0 detects an error. This works fine in Firefox 5.0 and Chrome 12. I use jQuery 1.6.2 and jQuery UI 1.8.13
[08:17:13] <Lothar>  <li><a href='action.php'>lien</a><li>
[08:17:46] <muzone> djQuery: something is wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HCx9y/1/ though - i cant click the label!
[08:17:55] <muzone> i can click outside it but..
[08:18:02] <reypa> lothar, have you debugged it?
[08:18:12] <reypa> to be shure it comes from jquery
[08:18:17] <reypa> *sure
[08:18:34] <Lothar> i debug but the debugger go on jquery1.6.3.js
[08:18:48] <reypa> what?
[08:19:02] <`Peter``> hi - is there a way to force an iframe to keep scrolling to the bottom when the page inside the iframe is a constant stream with PHP flushing information out?
[08:19:05] <`Peter``> ie, the iframe's onload is never triggered
[08:19:27] <Lothar> i don't want modified library, i think that problem is elsewhere
[08:19:59] <Rushing> `Peter``, use an interval?
[08:20:02] <Lothar> yeah a come from jquery because some element works
[08:20:09] <reypa> yeah but you have to debug in the jquery1.6.3.js to see what he does there and where he gets the stuff from that he does there
[08:20:35] <webresour> How can I have indepetend infoWindow for two diferent google maps in the same page ? What I need to do is to create two maps in my web site, and then add a marker on each one. Also on each marker to add a infoWindow with diferent message in it.
[08:20:40] <`Peter``> Rushing : can I scroll an iframe while it's still "loading"? and if so, how do I always scroll it to the bottom, not to a set pixel value
[08:20:52] <reypa> can you give me an exact error? with line ? or even better is that site online?
[08:20:56] <systemfault> Lothar: Why don't you just give us a link?
[08:21:06] <djQuery> muzone: ah I see what u are talking about. well that looks like an issue with the plugin.
[08:21:11] <webresour> At the moment I have create a message only for the first map, but on click I get the infoWindow on the second map :( ?
[08:21:20] <Jon47> `Peter`` you might be able to get the iframe to constantly report its height to the parent frame, but never expect it to look good if you're using iframes like that
[08:22:13] <Rushing> `Peter``, i've never tried, so i don't know...but for the scroll position you'd do a little math for the height of the page and set the topOffset
[08:22:28] <Lothar> yeah wait a reproduct
[08:22:33] <`Peter``> would scrolling it to a huge value work?
[08:22:36] <Rushing> look up some jquery animated scrolling plugins and those should give you some hints
[08:23:01] <Rushing> don't know, but easy enough to try :)
[08:23:22] <ldexterldesign> ajpiano: hey man, thanks for the help
[08:23:26] <muzone> djQuery: you sure its the plugin?
[08:23:40] <muzone> guess i gotta contact the author then
[08:24:03] <djQuery> muzone: pretty sure but I have no previous knoledge of this plugin.
[08:25:04] <ldexterldesign> ajpiano: is there a more efficient method for doing this: http://pastebin.com/MVMHe6Pk
[08:25:44] <djQuery> muzone: the only thing I see that you are missing by using placeholder instead is that the label is kinda visible when the input is focused.
[08:25:58] <djQuery> muzone: kinda fixed it for you http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/HCx9y/3/    kinda
[08:26:47] <muzone> djQuery: yeah it goes away when you start typing
[08:26:53] <blez> how to change dynamically the type of a textbox to a dropdown?
[08:26:57] <ajpiano> ldexterldesign, doesn't seem like it
[08:27:16] <erichynds> blez: no can do
[08:27:23] <ldexterldesign> ajpiano: cheers boss!
[08:27:37] <ldexterldesign> ajpiano: bit jquery rustie
[08:28:04] <muzone> djQuery: nice.. but the fading is gone and it doesnt reappear..
[08:28:27] <muzone> djQuery: would you use placeholders? iirc they arent compatible on all browsers..
[08:28:47] <Lothar> http://pastebin.com/cFzyeib8
[08:29:38] <reypa> lothar, are you sure? line 608 is 	"// rather than jQuery in Firefox"
[08:29:44] <systemfault> muzone: Of course placeholders are the way to go... As for compatibility, you could do feature detection and if the browser doesn't support it, use jQuery to emulate it.
[08:29:50] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, I'm looking for a dropin solution that'll make a -display- calendar, not nessecarily a datepicker
[08:29:51] <dssd07> whats the best and quickest way to start learning jquery?
[08:29:56] <muzone> thanks systemfault
[08:29:56] <djQuery> muzone: no they aren't compatable on all browsers but they dont cause it to break either. also the plugins for that are more popular\maintained
[08:30:13] <dssd07> for a beginner
[08:30:25] <djQuery> muzone: see ?modenizer
[08:30:26] <reypa> dssd07, make a mobile Web APP for smartphones, so you learn jquery and jquery mobile
[08:30:38] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[08:30:38] <systemfault> muzone: That might help http://www.red-team-design.com/how-to-create-a-cool-and-usable-css3-search-box
[08:30:38] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 7 minutes and 38 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[08:30:46] <Lothar> but line 60 is not really line 60 because when a cut this , the error persists
[08:32:09] <muzone> thanks systemfault, djQuery :)
[08:32:36] <`Peter``> scrollTo doesn't seem to work on my iframe at all
[08:32:38] <`Peter``> hm
[08:33:07] <djQuery> ?sop@ `Peter``
[08:33:18] <djQuery> damn bot
[08:33:33] <Lothar> if i stay link clear  <li><a href="">link</a></li> a have no error
[08:33:38] <djQuery> damn the intertubes are suckin today
[08:33:55] <reypa> and you have the error if your link looks like?
[08:34:34] <dssd07> which site would you recommend is the best way to learn jquery?
[08:34:38] <webresour> how can I destroy a variable in JavaScript ? variable = null ?
[08:34:48] <dssd07> like which site to read stuff on jquery
[08:34:53] <djQuery> jquery fundamentals
[08:34:57] <muzone> 17:34 < riven> Have you been hanging out in #jquery?
[08:34:57] <muzone> 17:36 < riven> So you're asking advice in a channel full of clueless people? Heh, smart!
[08:35:00] <muzone> 17:36 < muzone> hehe whatEVA
[08:35:03] <muzone> 17:36 < riven> Here, let me do your homework for you, muzone...
[08:35:05] <muzone> 17:36 < riven> "The placeholder attribute should not be used as an alternative to a label."
[08:35:09] <muzone> 17:36 < riven> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-input-element-attributes.html#attr-input-placeholder
[08:35:12] <muzone> 17:36 < riven> You're welcome. Anything else?
[08:35:22] <systemfault> muzone: Well, he's right to be honest.
[08:35:34] <webresour> anybody to help ?
[08:35:35] <`Peter``> never mind
[08:35:36] <`Peter``> there we go
[08:36:00] <systemfault> For an email for example, it should be:   Email: [lol@lulz.com]             lol@lulz.com being the placeholder
[08:36:41] <jedimind_> html5 placeholder
[08:36:46] <systemfault> But heh, if you really want that, I won't stop you
[08:37:15] <muzone> if i really want what?
[08:37:29] <djQuery> muzone: there are lots of companies that have spent lots of money figuring out the best way to layout a form. all thier results used a label.
[08:37:30] <muzone> the infield labels plugin doesnt work so i have no choice but to use placeholders
[08:37:58] <djQuery> muzone: will try to find the article
[08:38:16] <muzone> djQuery: i use labels for my forms too. its just for this search / newsletter signup box that i'd wanna use a placeholder
[08:38:32] <djQuery> but basicaly they were testing random people on thier speed in filling out the form and measuring thier mistakes in doing so
[08:38:52] <systemfault> muzone: And from a semantic point of view, fields without labels don't really make sense.
[08:40:40] <muzone> yup
[08:40:45] <muzone> i guess ill keep the labels and just indent them
[08:41:04] <noaXess> hey all
[08:41:14] <noaXess> this code won't work.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/639551/ whats the problem?
[08:42:26] <jedimind_> "wont work" in what sense?
[08:42:57] <ryanneufeld> noaXess: your selector is wayyy more specific than it needs to be
[08:43:13] <ryanneufeld> onkeyup="$('input#HIDDEN_emailconfirm:hidden').val($(this).val())" should be onkeyup="$('#HIDDEN_emailconfirm').val($(this).val())"
[08:43:18] <ryanneufeld> if you're using an ide
[08:43:20] <ryanneufeld> *id
[08:43:34] <ryanneufeld> you don't need anything else, as id's are unique
[08:43:39] <jedimind_> or should be anyway :)
[08:43:42] <noaXess> ryanneufeld: yeah.. test... wait
[08:43:46] <noaXess> i had that beore..
[08:43:47] <alban_> ola all. can't get callbacks to work with $.ajax, can someone provide a hint, please? cf. http://jsfiddle.net/Ywvcy/ (not working, ajax related)
[08:44:09] <ryanneufeld> noaXess: also, binding onkeyup is bad user experience
[08:44:24] <alban_> basically my callback function is not executed and I get no feedback in firebug
[08:44:25] <ryanneufeld> why do you need the value hidden, doesn't make sense
[08:44:27] <noaXess> ryanneufeld: and what to use instead?
[08:44:47] <ryanneufeld> noaXess: you're duplicating the input value, to what purpose?
[08:45:01] <noaXess> ryanneufeld: it's a very small from.. wich will go directly to phplist.. and phplist needs a email and emailconfirm field..
[08:45:18] <ryanneufeld> you should make the user enter both
[08:45:31] <alban_> Though using alert( fn_callback ) I can see the function is retrieved. Using fn_callback.call() doesn't work either.
[08:45:47] <systemfault> alban_: .ready takes a function as argument afaik, not at object.
[08:46:10] <djQuery> muzone: and in this use case I believe that riven is wrong as long as there is a proper icon representing what the input field is to be used for, you could always hide the label via css and only show it based on feature detection but then ure still screwed if they have js turned off and arent using a modern browser.
[08:46:10] <alban_> ah, well, I never remember offhand which method to use now
[08:46:11] <ryanneufeld> noaXess: if you're doing that for them, and they type it wrong, having the confirm field is pointless
[08:46:37] <noaXess> ryanneufeld: ok.. thats not the point.. anyway.. will use two email fields :).. but why doesn't it work?
[08:46:56] <alban_> systemfault: basically since $(document).ready() is "deprecated" by (function(){ ...}); and stuff, I always get them wrong
[08:46:58] <muzone> i fully agree with you djQuery
[08:47:00] <muzone> many thanks!
[08:47:06] <ryanneufeld> noaXess: you showed two elements
[08:47:11] <ryanneufeld> without seeing anything else
[08:47:13] <ryanneufeld> I have no idea
[08:47:19] <ryanneufeld> you could have other JS errors
[08:47:26] <alban_> the jsfiddle is an example, the real code works fine except the callback func
[08:47:28] <ryanneufeld> jquery could not be loaded
[08:47:36] <noaXess> ryanneufeld: no errors.. so firebug don't list any errors.. must be something other
[08:47:53] <ryanneufeld> noaXess: firebug doesn't always show errors
[08:48:14] <ryanneufeld> jquery hides them sometimes
[08:48:26] <ryanneufeld> try this
[08:48:36] <djQuery> noaXess: have you thought about adding an error: function to your ajax call?
[08:48:54] <ryanneufeld> onkeyup="console.log($(this).val())"
[08:49:00] <alban_> corrected .ready http://jsfiddle.net/Ywvcy/1/
[08:49:01] <ajpiano> noaXess, try window[fn_callback]()
[08:49:09] <topcat__> geekbuntu : working script if you wanted to see for yourself. Still needs some work to make it a proper plugin. http://jsfiddle.net/Ysgd7/5/ --Cheers
[08:49:19] <ajpiano> noaXess, there's a difference between having a reference to the function and a reference to a string that happens to have the same name as the function
[08:49:19] <wookie> hello
[08:49:32] <noaXess> ryanneufeld: that works... i got it.. :).. wrong doctype :) damn..
[08:49:40] <wookie> how can i select and <option > by its value attribute ?
[08:49:43] <ryanneufeld> :)
[08:49:50] <noaXess> ajpiano: öhm... don't know what you mean ;)
[08:50:01] <wookie> an*
[08:50:02] <alban_> so no one for callbacks ?
[08:50:07] <ajpiano> oh wait
[08:50:17] <ajpiano> alban_, read up, the comments i just directed at noaXess were for you
[08:50:18] <ajpiano> my mistake.
[08:50:23] <wookie> $('option[value=123]') ?
[08:50:32] <ryanneufeld> wookie: have you tried that?
[08:50:32] <ajpiano> wookie: put the value in quotes but yes
[08:50:34] <noaXess> ajpiano: no proble.. :)..
[08:50:37] <alban_> ah, ok
[08:50:55] <alban_> mmm ajpiano if the function was not existing, wouldn't firebug shout at that ?
[08:51:01] <wookie> $('.selectclass option[value="123"]') this way ?
[08:51:01] <Lothar> exit
[08:51:03] <alban_> but let's try anyway
[08:51:07] <ajpiano> you don't have a function reference alban_, you have a string
[08:51:19] <ajpiano> and a global function that you happened to create inside of doc ready
[08:51:20] <djQuery> anyone wanna give me a hand with this templates issue <tbody>{{tmpl(Columns, { getIndex: function(item){return $.inArray(item, Columns);}}) "#coltmpl"}}</tbody>  how do I get the index in a child template this works correctly in the parent. http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/26/edit
[08:52:08] <alban_> mmm ok I think I get it
[08:52:22] <alban_> ( by your ref to string vs. ref to function )
[08:52:39] <ajpiano> ok :)
[08:53:03] <djQuery> wookie: no hangover today?
[08:53:19] <ajpiano> lol not the same guy
[08:53:20] <ajpiano> :p
[08:53:27] <djQuery> oops
[08:54:12] <alban_> var foo  = {"bar":function(x){alert(x)}; callback = foo.bar; callback.call("bar"); // echoes "bar"
[08:54:14] <alban_> ?
[08:54:26] <alban_> or something like that
[08:54:37] <ajpiano> alban_, the first arg to call is the scope, not arguments
[08:55:27] <alban_> how so ?
[08:55:54] <ajpiano> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/function/call
[08:56:03] <alban_> ah, that's for call
[08:56:16] <alban_> yeah ok, I didn't read at all, my mistake
[08:56:32] <alban_> but except that, I think I get the idea and my sorry error
[08:56:49] <ajpiano> alban_ ok
[08:57:06] <ajpiano> imo, it would be better to eliminate the whole "passing around the string name of functions" thing unless you find it's absolutely necessary
[08:57:08] <alban_> is http://jsfiddle.net/Ywvcy/2/ correct
[08:57:18] <Cherishbridal> hello.. could someone help me with a little query I have?
[08:57:21] <alban_> how would you do that otherwise ?
[08:57:34] <alban_> it's a function I want to reuse all over the app
[08:57:49] <Cherishbridal> I have a contact form in a modal and i need it to clear on submit..  is this something easy I can sort?
[08:57:56] <alban_> so I thought using callbacks was a good way to generalise it
[08:58:03] <Cherishbridal> can I do this without a page refresh?
[08:58:12] <ajpiano> var MYAPP = {};  MYAPP.whatever = function() { .... };    $.get("something.url", MYAPP.whatever);
[08:58:24] <ajpiano> alban_, using callbacks is a good wasy to generalise it
[08:58:32] <Rushing> Cherish, $("form").submit(function(){ $(".mydialog").dialog("close") });
[08:58:34] <ajpiano> just you can pass references to the callback functions themselves, instead of passing their name around
[08:58:41] <alban_> ( I used to make almost 1 func for each ajax call / callback )
[08:59:00] <ajpiano> and then your functions don't all have to be global
[08:59:27] <alban_> oh.
[08:59:42] <Cherishbridal> thanks rushing.. do I need to insert this in the div where my form lives or can i just place it anywhere if its calling the form?
[09:00:30] <Rushing> that code problably won't work exactly the way it is, but that's the gist
[09:00:48] <Rushing> i don't know where it needs to go without seeing the rest of the code, but i can't dig right now ;)
[09:01:14] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: errr $('#myform').reset()
[09:01:38] <alban_> ajpiano: something like that http://jsfiddle.net/Ywvcy/3/ ? ie. "callback": Nspc.Obj.CbckMthd
[09:02:15] <ajpiano> alban_ yessir
[09:02:19] <ajpiano> also feel free to use vowels
[09:02:19] <ajpiano> :D
[09:02:22] <ajpiano> they are ... free.
[09:02:28] <alban_> hehe
[09:02:39] <djQuery> ajpiano: except the vowels iou
[09:03:00] <alban_> ok, it really makes sense thank you so much for helping
[09:03:09] <Cherishbridal> oooh.. do i use rushings or drquerys?
[09:03:29] <Cherishbridal> djquery .. does that simply sit after the form end
[09:03:38] <PrinceES> what is wrong on my script.... it fetch the result from xml but ... cant display ....http://pastebin.com/46gtuFgT
[09:03:39] <alban_> Really better to take advantage of the "Namespace" and have callbacks depend on it
[09:03:50] <ajpiano> alban_: yes indeed :)
[09:04:16] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: you need to combine them. his will close out the dialog but not reset the form. meaning if they open it again the form will still be populated with thier previous values.
[09:04:45] <Cherishbridal> yes.. thats whats happening at present
[09:05:12] <djQuery> Rushing: are u doing some kinda ajax submit?
[09:05:39] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: ^^^^^ sorry Rushing:
[09:05:53] <Cherishbridal> yes.
[09:06:21] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: if so then you want to reset the form in the success of the ajax call and hide the dialog there as well
[09:08:03] <alban_> it works and it's easier to maintain, great! Thanks
[09:08:17] <Cherishbridal> this is my ajax request:  // Ajax request     $.post(Form.action(), Form.data(), function(data){         var $return = eval('(' + data + ')');         if($return === true){             Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['success']);         }else if($return === false){             Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['error']);         }         else{         for(var i in $return){             Form.showBox('#' + $return[i] + Form.errorPrefix);  
[09:09:00] <PrinceES> playing the flv video in jquery slider banner?
[09:09:16] <PrinceES> i am looking for plugin
[09:09:27] <djQuery> where you are doing this  Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['success']); you want to add a reset to your form.
[09:10:29] <Cherishbridal> the showbox is some popup dialog which advises the mail has sent successfully
[09:10:36] <Cherishbridal> do I add it in after this process?
[09:10:52] <PrinceES> what is wrong on my script.... it fetches the result from xml but ... cant display ....http://pastebin.com/46gtuFgT
[09:11:22] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: just as long as its in that same if block I would imagine
[09:12:44] <Cherishbridal> so this djquery?    Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['success']) $('contactForm').reset();
[09:12:46] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: so you have a .dialog that opens another box on submit of that one
[09:13:19] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: well it would probably be $('#contactForm').reset();
[09:16:40] <BlaDe> I have: http://pastie.org/private/plrkavaosnlkeiqlwc5kdw
[09:16:54] <BlaDe> for some reason, the popup refuses to open with lines 3-8 active
[09:17:03] <BlaDe> I suppose it opens, and instantly closes but I can't figure out why
[09:19:00] <Cherishbridal> djquery that just broke the dialog.. I think I need to insert it into a later stage..
[09:19:23] <Cherishbridal> there is another dialog which is the success popup
[09:19:30] <Cherishbridal> should I put in after that?
[09:21:28] <PrinceES> i am having this error ..
[09:21:33] <PrinceES> uncaught exception: [Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentFragment.appendChild]" nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)" location: "JS frame :: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 113" data: no]
[09:23:22] <BlaDe> PrinceES we're on jquery 1.6.2 now
[09:23:25] <BlaDe> why are you using 1.4.2 ?
[09:24:00] <PrinceES> ok...
[09:24:09] <PrinceES> i am going to change it
[09:25:39] <chris__> Hi
[09:26:07] <chris__> Im having a few problems with my site, can anyone help?
[09:26:07] <Cherishbridal> DJQUERY..  would it be the close of the modal box that I need to tag the reset to?
[09:26:51] <chris__> im getting a few errors
[09:27:15] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: I wouldnt use to dialogs that would be kinda anoying. but yes close out the first dialog in the same code that opens the 2nd.
[09:28:06] <chris__> can anyone help?
[09:28:09] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: I would probably jut have a hidden div in the first dialog that was displayed when the success was true and start a timer to close out the dialog if the uer doesnt click on the X
[09:28:33] <Cherishbridal> djQuery: Would you mind having a quick look at my form to see the best way of doing it?
[09:28:50] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: you could move the reset code to the code that opens the dialog
[09:29:19] <Cherishbridal> think I may be getting a little lost with it..
[09:29:22] <djQuery> Cherishbridal: kinda workin on something
[09:29:31] <Cherishbridal> sorry no probs
[09:32:15] <Cherishbridal> Rushing: sorry would you be able to help me on that reset thing?
[09:32:23] <chris__> anyone?
[09:33:07] <Cherishbridal> I have a close dialog  for the modal which is a.close-reveal-modal
[09:35:44] <Cherishbridal> Anyone know then how I can set a timer to clear a form after it has been submitted?
[09:39:06] <JKarsrud> ?ajax
[09:39:20] <JKarsrud> meh, no bot-t
[09:39:37] <ryanneufeld> Cherishbridal: have you tried form.reset() ?
[09:40:22] <Cherishbridal> I need to know where to insert it thats the problem ryanneufeld
[09:40:57] <ryanneufeld> Cherishbridal: in your submit handler
[09:41:02] <ryanneufeld> after your ajax call
[09:41:53] <Cherishbridal> so after $('#' + Form.name).submit(function(){
[09:46:00] <Cherishbridal> hmm that didnt work.. <ryanneufeld> could you have a quick look at my form?
[09:46:20] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ Cherishbridal
[09:46:28] <ryanneufeld> ahh, no bot-t
[09:46:30] <ryanneufeld> dang
[09:46:40] <ryanneufeld> k post your JS somewhere
[09:47:00] <Cherishbridal> k
[09:47:02] <Cherishbridal> thanks
[09:49:31] <Cherishbridal> ryanneufeld http://chicfreakz.co.uk/assets/js/js.js
[09:51:12] <ryanneufeld> before your return false
[09:51:19] <ryanneufeld> add: this.reset();
[09:51:28] <Carraway> question -- is dropbox using any kind of standard slideshow plugin for their hosted slideshows? or is it a proprietary thing to dropbox? http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/413066/1/Wallpaper%20Test?h=90f8ac
[09:51:48] <Carraway> i'm asking because it looks familiar, but I can't place where I might have seen it
[09:51:53] <Cherishbridal> where do I need to add it ? thanks
[09:52:41] <ryanneufeld> Cherishbridal: read up i already told you
[09:53:14] <ryanneufeld> in your submit callback
[09:53:20] <ryanneufeld> before you return false
[09:53:41] <ryanneufeld> alos, your code needs better formatting
[09:53:43] <Cherishbridal> gotcha... sorry ryannuefeld.
[09:53:48] <Cherishbridal> thanks .. sorry I see it now..
[09:58:33] <Cherishbridal>  <ryanneufeld>  Thanks , that cleared the fields but the success dialog remains when you go back into it..
[09:58:42] <Cherishbridal> do I need to reset this somehow too?
[09:58:49] <ryanneufeld> clearly
[09:59:55] <g0bl1n> is there any method to sort an object based on a specific value ?
[10:00:06] <g0bl1n> a JSON object
[10:00:14] <Cherishbridal> maybe bet if this dissapeared after a time period.. of just few seconds
[10:00:35] <g0bl1n> I need to sort it by some field, since we get it unsorted
[10:01:17] <ryanneufeld> Cherishbridal: you can use your success and error callbacks for thst
[10:01:24] <McChen> question: if i can do "var something = $('some selector')" can i also do "var someotherthing = something.find('more selector')"
[10:01:28] <djQuery> g0bl1n: the native array.sort outa do that it accepts a function to do the filtering.
[10:01:37] <ryanneufeld> ^^
[10:01:43] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: what he said
[10:01:44] <g0bl1n> on a success ajax response, I need to sort the json blob by data['type']['sub']['value']
[10:01:55] <djQuery> McChen: yes
[10:02:10] <McChen> djQuery: thanks
[10:02:25] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/array/sort
[10:02:38] <g0bl1n> oh, ty !!!
[10:02:56] <ryanneufeld> np
[10:03:00] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:03:12] <McChen> djQuery: hmm doesn't seem to let me do it
[10:05:16] <Corren> do you guys have any preferred places to post a job listing to?
[10:08:04] <jil> hi
[10:09:04] <djQuery> ?deno@ McChen
[10:09:14] <djQuery> demo rather
[10:12:32] <Cherishbridal> <ryanneufeld> cant get it right....
[10:12:47] <Cherishbridal> cant seem to rehide the success box
[10:13:50] <Cherishbridal> i know that its this   Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['success'])
[10:14:02] <Cherishbridal> but the opposite
[10:14:06] <g0bl1n> djQuery, json objects can be sorted ?
[10:15:07] <Cherishbridal> should it be Form.hideBox('#' + Form.id['success'])
[10:15:22] <Cherishbridal> and if so not sure where to drop this
[10:15:34] <g0bl1n> djQuery, ryanneufeld trying to sort a JSON object but doesn't seem to workwith sort()
[10:16:33] <McChen> djQuery: demo here: var hey = $('#selector'); var haha = hey.find('.anotherselector'); haha.click(function(e) {});"
[10:17:22] <systemfault> g0: You can sort arrays, not objects.
[10:19:02] <g0bl1n> systemfault, yes, tested. Is there any way to sort a received JSON object, or will I have to code it ?
[10:19:20] <systemfault> Objects don't have an order
[10:19:36] <systemfault> Only arrays.
[10:19:51] <g0bl1n> fsck Ruby 1.8.7 Hashes :-)
[10:22:59] <sprezzatura> is there a good jquery based file uploader with progress bars?
[10:23:48] <jil> How can I make sure to trigger a mouseleave event when I move out fast from a block?
[10:24:50] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: you can iterate over an object, and use .hasOwnProperty() to makes sure it's an member of the object and not part of the prototype
[10:25:20] <ryanneufeld> g0bl1n: then you can build an array and sort that
[10:25:38] <elb0w> Any lightweight charts that use json someone can rec?
[10:26:15] <systemfault> Not exactly lightweight but check highcharts
[10:26:19] <jil> I am creating a dynamic menu showing hidden ul elements as I enter the li elements and hidding them as I leave the li elements.  But when I leave the li elements very fast, the mouseleave event seems not to be triggered.
[10:27:19] <systemfault> jil: From that sentence.. I'm wondering why you don't use CSS for that
[10:27:32] <jedimind_> can anyone point me to a decent example on how to do filtering with xml items ? i have an xml document that has say 30 <project> objects, but only a handful have <featured> as a filter, and i'd like to display only those
[10:27:34] <systemfault> (I know.. it's not really a fix but since I can't see any code..)
[10:28:54] <jil> the code is here but it does not render as on my machine http://jsfiddle.net/MySae/
[10:31:36] <JAAulde> kborchers[A]: ping
[10:32:14] <kborchers[A]> JAAulde: yo
[10:32:46] <JAAulde> kborchers: I am considering this as a monkey patch until latest jQ and UI are compatible: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/shgnwwuvdffhnvleum2s9g
[10:33:11] <JAAulde> kborchers:  It works, but I wonder if I could be introducing a race condition
[10:33:15] <JAAulde> any thoughts?
[10:33:32] <notjrbauer> is anyone a jCaroselLite pro?
[10:36:32] <kborchers> JAAulde: hmm, yeah that seems a little scary if you have a bunch of removeAttr's fire in a row
[10:36:43] <jil> Ok, the solution I found was to create a reset function which set my menu back to the starting position when I hover the html document.
[10:36:49] <mpir> hello all… pretty new both at jquery and irc :) and need some help.. could I ask someone for assistance?
[10:36:52] <ryanneufeld> elb0w: check out wijmo too
[10:37:05] <ryanneufeld> mpir: just ask
[10:37:12] <JAAulde> kborchers: right, right.  hmm. Well, I can do it differently...
[10:37:14] <ryanneufeld> ? ask
[10:37:25] <mpir> thx: how could i add livequery to this code:
[10:37:27] <jil> I feel bad for all the $("html").mousehover(...)  wasted.
[10:37:35] <mpir> $().ready(function() {
[10:37:35] <mpir> 	$('#coda-slider-1').codaSlider({
[10:37:35] <mpir> 		dynamicArrows: false,
[10:37:35] <mpir> 		dynamicTabs: false,	
[10:37:35] <mpir> 	});		
[10:37:36] <mpir> 	
[10:37:36] <mpir> });
[10:37:44] <gnarf> BOOO mpir
[10:37:49] <gnarf> see ?p
[10:37:51] <mpir> i know, i know
[10:38:00] <ryanneufeld> then don't do it :)
[10:38:03] <kborchers> gnarf: bot-t is sleeping off another bender ;)
[10:38:05] <mpir> sorry 'bout that
[10:38:10] <gnarf> kborchers: oh well
[10:38:18] <mpir> that's why i asked first
[10:38:22] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net @mpir
[10:38:31] <gnarf> don't EVER paste code in IRC dude
[10:38:41] <mpir> that I didn't know
[10:38:49] <necromancer> hah
[10:39:17] <gnarf> mpir: you just spammed 923 people with 6 lines of code that you could of easily put on some online pastebin
[10:39:59] <mpir> again, my aplogies, and I did ask when entering if I could ask for help with jquery
[10:40:12] <gnarf> mpir: livequery is not a very good plugin
[10:40:26] <gnarf> and I have no idea how to use it correctly
[10:41:24] <JAAulde> kborchers: I will try this one: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/jgu0qfe3bvertjp5tpvptw If I do it any other way,  will have to directly modify jQuery itself as a monkey patch has no access to the privatized vars which the real removeAttr() is using
[10:41:56] <mpir> gnarf: thank you.. guess I'll go back to forums and the jquery site (where is suggested to join this channel) won't be pasting any code in irc ever again… sorry
[10:44:33] <kborchers> JAAulde: i think that should work without a race condition. a little simpler too ;)
[10:44:45] <JAAulde> kborchers: agreed. thanks for taking a look
[10:45:22] <sic1> ? is there a (simple) way to access my original ajax options from any done or fail on said ajax call
[10:45:54] <sic1> other than just agumenting my arguments with the original ajax options in the done or fail...
[10:51:58] <AlexKourou> Hello
[11:02:40] <hariom> I am trying to send  JSON encoded data using ajax post request but the server replies that it is not encoded properly. http://pastebin.com/J7wNUYqB
[11:02:48] <hariom> Would like to know where I am doing mistake
[11:04:43] <skylamer`> may be line 9, hariom
[11:05:25] <hariom> skylamer: how come line 9? Server is getting request.
[11:06:51] <sic1> im lookin at it also...
[11:08:49] <whateverb> hi, is it possible to modify div follow code for lower resolution monitors? So that first it scrolls to the end of the sidebar and then the whole page. http://jsbin.com/iloqen/2/edit#source  Can anyone smarter take a look ?
[11:11:49] <sic1> hariom: try this http://pastebin.com/9vnqYVGh
[11:13:28] <sic1> oh sheit dude, u got ur vars messed up a bit too i just saw
[11:13:49] <hariom> sic1: yea that works. I had this earlier but not I want to convert all $.post or $.getJSON or $.get to $.ajax
[11:14:11] <sic1> sweet
[11:14:39] <sic1> ive done stuff the same, and just letting jquery handle it is the way to go for sending data
[11:14:49] <hariom> sic1: $.post sends the request well but $.ajax can't. Don't know what is missing
[11:14:51] <sic1> idk why ur first code wasnt working
[11:15:06] <sic1> prob some ajax option...
[11:15:13] <sic1> while we are talking about ajax options....
[11:15:32] <sic1> ? is there a way to access my original ajax options from any done or fail on said ajax call
[11:15:33] <bot-t> sic1, .bind() - Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[11:15:35] <hariom> sci1: I already have set contentType to 'application/json'
[11:16:57] <fructose> Is there something wrong about do this... function GetVal() { var obj  = $.getJSON('foo.php', {getVal: true}); return obj.responseText; } ? When I do it manually, it works, but in a function, it returns an empty string.
[11:17:47] <sic1> wellll
[11:17:54] <sic1> u wanna look at the responseText in ur done
[11:18:03] <gaspar|work> how do I add div created to jquery right after the script reference?
[11:18:08] <sic1> dont do the obj var
[11:18:39] <sic1> ur gonna need to rework how u said that one gaspar, im not sure what u mean
[11:18:56] <fructose> sic1: Same problem without the obj var... adding .responseText also gets me an empty string
[11:18:59] <gaspar|work> sic: I have a div created in jquery
[11:19:11] <gaspar|work> I want to append it to the document right after <script> tag
[11:19:25] <sic1> why
[11:19:34] <sic1> already sounds like a bad ide
[11:19:35] <sic1> a
[11:19:50] <gaspar|work> i am developing twitter widget for tumblr
[11:19:54] <sic1> if ur appending something to something else, espeically a div, u need an intenifier, ie: an id, to append to
[11:20:07] <gaspar|work> I have div with an id
[11:20:12] <chovy> how do i remove the opactiy inline styhle that fadeIn adds to an element?
[11:20:18] <gaspar|work> if that is what you are asking for
[11:20:43] <sic1> then append ur new div to that div with the id
[11:20:52] <sic1> but u need something to append to, otherwise append to the body
[11:21:09] <gnarf> chovy: .css("opacity","") ?
[11:21:40] <gaspar|work> OK, here's my problem. I want to include JUST the <script> tag in the tumblr page. Script loads tweets and displays them.  I need to create div to hold the tweets in jquery.
[11:22:05] <sic1> gnarf! can u answer my question....how to access original ajax options from a done or fail on that ajax call...
[11:22:13] <gaspar|work> How do I add the new created div to DOM right after the script? SHould I just use document.write at the begining of my script?
[11:22:17] <gnarf> sic1:  "this" ?
[11:22:22] <hariom> Can anybody share any example of sending post request with data encoded as JSON  and using $.ajax  (note it is $.ajax not $.post)? This is how I tried http://pastebin.com/J7wNUYqB but failing to get the result from the server
[11:22:42] <chovy> gnarf: that didn't work.
[11:22:42] <sic1> fructose: set up a fiddle or something...hard to help otherwise
[11:22:54] <gnarf> chovy: jsfiddle?
[11:23:18] <chovy> the problem is when an element fades in (in IE8) it leaves the filter: alpha(opacity=100); intact, and that screws up all the fonts on the page that are bold.
[11:24:16] <sic1> gnarf: OMG! dude, how did i totally miss `this`....wow, i have never had to do taht before, so i guess i just never thought about it...thanks yo
[11:24:53] <gnarf> chovy: I've been working on solving this bug
[11:24:56] <gnarf> and its not an easy one
[11:25:33] <gnarf> sic1: is there any filter/opacity defined on the element in CSS?
[11:25:37] <gnarf> if not
[11:26:18] <gnarf> you can do .fadeIn( 1000, funciton() { this.style.filter = ""; });
[11:26:26] <sic1> hrmmm
[11:26:32] <gnarf> or maybe its delete
[11:26:32] <sic1> lemme find that snippit i got somewhere
[11:26:44] * gnarf looks at my pull
[11:27:01] <chovy> only the fadeTo(1, 200) function is all i'm using there. The problem is children element inherit the filter rule from the main content area that has it.
[11:27:33] <gnarf> chovy: then you can't do anything to shut off the filter
[11:27:35] <gnarf> trust me
[11:27:40] <chovy> if you add a background color it gets 'a little' better, but still not perfect.
[11:27:53] <gnarf> clearType will be disabled no matter what you put for filter:
[11:29:11] <gnarf> This is the method I used to remove the filter from the inline style: var style = elem.style; style.cssText = style.cssText.replace( /filter:[^;]*;?/i, "" );
[11:29:12] <sic1> in ur animate callback...if ($.browser.msie) { $(this).get(0).style.removeAttribute('filter');
[11:29:46] <gnarf> sic1: no need to sniff msie
[11:29:50] <chovy> gnarf: never say never
[11:29:52] <sic1> im not totally sure on the context at this point, but thats what i've used...
[11:29:55] <chovy> sic1: exactly :)
[11:30:15] <chovy> works for me.

[11:30:28] <sic1> i've lost track of half this convo lol, that work?
[11:30:35] <gaspar|work> Is there a way to load jquery in javascript file and use it right away?
[11:30:40] <gnarf> chovy: then you lied about having a filter in the css... :)
[11:30:46] <sic1> and i shall drop that sniff gnarf :P
[11:31:08] <sic1> thx
[11:31:12] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/9rXBV/9/
[11:31:21] <gnarf> sic1: the better sniff is checking for the feature
[11:31:23] <gnarf> also
[11:31:24] <sic1> im still in awe i never tried `this` in a done before > <
[11:31:29] <gnarf> $(this).get(0) is dumb
[11:31:39] <Jayflux> hey gnarf
[11:31:41] <gnarf> its "this"
[11:32:09] <sic1> u know i dont disagree, lmao, my coworker set that one up, ill yell at him for u :)
[11:32:14] <gnarf> var style = this.style; if (style.removeAttribute) style.removeAttribute('filter'); should suffice @sic1 @chovy
[11:32:25] <sic1> lol
[11:32:29] <sic1> thanks man

[11:33:08] <gnarf> I really need to get a Test VM for IE9 going
[11:33:18] <sic1> yeaa....
[11:34:21] <sic1> u dont like backticks?
[11:35:10] <Solow> Can I also get jqueryUI help here?
[11:36:35] <sic1> just shoot with ur question Solow
[11:36:43] <sic1> i dont know jUI, but others might
[11:37:03] <Solow> Will do...
[11:38:24] <gnarf> chovy / sic1: btw, do you know if that only effects IE8+ or if IE6/7 have those issues with "filter" ?
[11:38:28] <Solow> I''m looking at sortable, draggable, and dropable. Now what I want to do is drag something from one container, and drop it in another. BUT I also want to be able to sort it before dropping it. The shopping cart example shows me how to drag, drop, and afterwards sort. But I want to drag, sort, and drop. I can't connect lists, because I dont want list one to be sortable. I just want it to be a supplier
[11:42:02] <sic1> checking
[11:42:58] <sic1> gnarf: coworker says - IE8 and below have filter issues any time you animate opacity
[11:43:16] <gnarf> and below? so 7 and 6 too?
[11:43:18] <sic1> and he said no ur dumb
[11:43:18] <sic1> yes
[11:43:35] <soc42> hi #jquery
[11:43:45] <sic1> 6, 7, 8 all have the problem
[11:43:54] <sic1> hi soc
[11:44:10] <soc42> i am trying to access a .html page from an iframe via jquery
[11:44:14] <soc42> have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/VGKHv/
[11:44:28] <soc42> but i think, something's missing...
[11:44:33] <sic1> and Solow: man, im not even sure waht ur asking totally, u need to start gettin some code set up, or start lookin at plugins to see if u can find ur desired functionality
[11:45:06] <Solow> sic1: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#shopping-cart It's right there
[11:45:08] <soc42> i try to put the contents of a specific div of the loaded iframe (blue) into my result div (red) on the same page
[11:45:16] <gnarf> I'm not sure if removeAttribute is available in ie6
[11:45:19] <sic1> perfect, then u got it :)
[11:45:30] <Solow> sic1: But when dropping, it's being appended, while I actually want it to drop between two items, like a sortable.
[11:46:02] <sic1> Solow: im not sure on that one man, nor do i have the time to figure it out right now...sorry bud
[11:46:15] <sic1> not sure on that one either gnarf
[11:46:28] <Solow> sic1: No problem, just thought I'd explain my question a bit more. Thanks for your time
[11:46:37] <sic1> np, just tough at work right now :P
[11:47:02] <sic1> not familiar with jqUI tools at all
[11:47:16] <Solow> I'll figure something out :)
[11:47:37] <gnarf> hrm
[11:47:48] <gnarf> sic1: tell your coworker thanks for the removeAttribute btw
[11:47:58] <gnarf> sic1: didn't realize that worked on style objects in IE
[11:48:31] <sic1> gnarf: for sure, i remember us battling that one back when...
[11:48:58] <yurakeshi> i'm having trouble using jquery-ui autocomplete combobox with scrollable content: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZhmD/1/
[11:49:04] <sontek> Any of you guys know what plugins work well with fancybox for scrolling?
[11:49:08] <mehale1> how can a selector match not selected <option> elements?
[11:49:16] <sic1> gnarf: and removeAttribute does work in ie6 actually, for this purpose at least
[11:49:21] <sontek> I have a bunch of links inside a fancybox and I want to scroll to that content
[11:50:20] <yurakeshi> it only show one option row
[11:50:37] <yurakeshi> the overflow auto with max-height is not being respected
[11:54:37] <soc42> is it possible at all to access iframe content like this?
[11:54:38] <soc42> http://jsfiddle.net/VGKHv/
[11:55:15] <mehale> how can a selector match all not selected <option> elements?

[12:00:17] <ch3mical> Something like $('option').not(':selected') might work
[12:00:25] <chovy> soc42: good question. I don't think so, but I'm not positive.
[12:00:51] <ch3mical> soc42: only if the domain, protocol and port match
[12:00:57] <soc42> hey chovy: mabye it has something to do with security restrictions

[12:06:09] <ericincoldohio> i have a dialog that displays fine as a modal...how can i shut off the scroll bars of the page behind the popup? this shut off my scrollbars of the dialog $("body").css("overflow", "hidden");
[12:19:37] <AsherMaximum> ericincoldohio: I did this before I was using jquery (I had written my own dialog) by setting all the other elements on the page to fixed
[12:20:05] <AsherMaximum> I haven't implemented it in my jquery dialog solution yet
[12:20:34] <swiggy> why do jquery ui <buttons> change the url to the ID of the button???
[12:20:50] <swiggy> so frustrating
[12:20:54] <yurakeshi> does anyone ever used a jquery-ui autocomplete combobox with scrolable results? it's driving me insane
[12:22:38] <ryrych> hi guys :)
[12:22:59] <kborchers> yurakeshi: i'm confused. ui does not have a widget called combobox
[12:23:36] <yurakeshi> kborchers, the autocomplete have a combobox "version"
[12:23:37] <ryrych> how do you deal with white space? I am using Komodo and I noticed that I have much white space at the end of a line. I would like to know what to do with it?
[12:24:02] <yurakeshi> kborchers, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[12:24:13] <Protomega> https://0bv7.showoff.io/
[12:24:24] <Protomega> Why is my ajax callback not executing?
[12:25:21] <kborchers> yurakeshi: ok, but your fiddle earlier did not have that combobox plugin code in it. that is not part of the ui library, you need to copy all of that combobox code from the example
[12:25:59] <cherishbridal> hi all I am trying to reset a form which has some catcpha and also shows some boxes for success or errors..  Super Ajax contact form if you have come accross it..  I am trying to clear the form within a modal but after its done everything it needs to.. without a page refresh..
[12:26:04] <AsherMaximum> swiggy: that's not the default functionality. do you have a fiddle or pastebin?
[12:26:37] <yurakeshi> kborchers, i did. The combobox it self works ok. The problem is in the styling it to became scrolable.
[12:26:46] <cherishbridal> I had some help earlier on here but it was clearing things too early and also cleared on submit
[12:26:49] <luchenbill> is there some kind of jquery stock market api?
[12:27:01] <quackquack> How can i convert a `keypress` event into the key typed?
[12:27:38] <cherishbridal> it cleared before it call go back to correct validation etc
[12:27:58] <cherishbridal> can someone have a look atmy form and advise where the clear part should sit..
[12:29:03] <kborchers> yurakeshi: but your fiddle doesn't work so i can't see what's wrong until you fix that.
[12:29:11] <AsherMaximum> cherishbridal: fiddle, pastebin?
[12:29:43] <Protomega> https://qx5c.showoff.io/
[12:29:51] <gar_onn> is there a jQuery .enter bind?
[12:29:54] <Protomega> Why is my ajax callback not getting executed?
[12:29:54] <cherishbridal> can i send   a location of the js..
[12:30:13] <yurakeshi> kborchers, i was checking if anybody have a sample about it. But i probably did something stupid when cleaning and changing the css.
[12:30:15] <cherishbridal> eg, http://chicfreakz.co.uk/assets/js/js.js
[12:30:39] <cherishbridal> does that help  <AsherMaximum>

[12:31:23] <AsherMaximum> <cherishbridal> is that your code?
[12:31:30] <kborchers> gar_onn: you'll have to check keyup or keydown then check the event.keyCode
[12:31:41] <gar_onn> can i use Bind?
[12:32:14] <kborchers> gar_onn: .bind("keyup", function(event) { check event.keyCode here and do other stuff });
[12:32:18] <Armern> Hey guys, I am trying to generate a day string in "yyyy-MM-dd" format, but I have a start date and in a loop I'd like to add one day to the current date every time.. I tried using datejs, which jquery does not like any bit, since it complains about the .add method not working on that time object... It is giving me a headache! Does anyone know how I could do this?
[12:32:33] <luchenbill> is there some kind of jquery stock market api?
[12:32:38] <gar_onn> ty kborchers
[12:32:42] <luchenbill> to pull stock quotes from a website?
[12:33:05] <alexwait> I like the interface of the jquery autocomplete plugin but don't want it to search trhough data
[12:33:15] <alexwait> just display in that droppdown style data I'vesearched for myself
[12:33:50] <AlexKourou> Hello,i m experiencing a strange situation where: on a click a cookie is set and removed on something elses click.All works fine till i refresh page manually and not by clicking something.Code is here: http://pastebin.com/J6ch11BK .I d like some advice is som1 is willing to read this :D
[12:35:53] <kborchers> yurakeshi: try adding a height or min-height to ui-autocomplete
[12:37:08] <cherishbridal> thats the javascript part of the plugin
[12:37:43] <nahuel> hi, how can I add an init process when I open a jquery-ui dialog ?
[12:37:46] <kborchers> AlexKourou: so the problem is your cookie is not set when you refresh the page manually, right?
[12:38:10] <alexwait> can you style the dropdown menu
[12:38:15] <alexwait> on the autocomplete plugin?
[12:39:29] <AsherMaximum> <cherishbridal> It would help if i could see it in action.
[12:39:36] <kborchers> ?dialog @ nahuel
[12:39:38] <bot-t> nahuel, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
[12:39:53] <kborchers> nahuel look at the open event in the dialog api
[12:40:03] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum>: yes it was from the plugin
[12:40:05] <AlexKourou> it is set, i v checked that.It just display:none for the #openheader div so #headerwrapper stays with 25px height.I think it "reads" the js before the css but this cant be happening..Where is the autocomplete plugin ?I was goin to recreate this on jsfiddle
[12:40:19] <nahuel> kborchers, thanks !  I looked in the jquery-ui demos…
[12:41:07] <Protomega> May I please get some help?
[12:41:18] <kborchers> ?ask @ Protomega
[12:41:18] <bot-t> Protomega, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:41:36] <Protomega> Well after the fourth time asking I wanted to make sure I could ask..
[12:41:57] <kborchers> ?autocomplete @ AlexKourou
[12:42:17] <AlexKourou> ?autocomplete
[12:42:26] <AlexKourou> ? :/ I feel retarded...
[12:42:31] <Protomega> https://y8x2.showoff.io/ in the parts tab, when I press save changes it isn't executing the ajax callback..
[12:42:39] <kborchers> oh bot-t :(
[12:42:58] <cherishbridal> it was suggested earlier that I just do a this.reset() which did clear things but I it cleared things where they needed to stay..  I need them to clear after all other processes have happend
[12:43:04] <stianhj> Can you override CSS property with !important using jquery?
[12:45:06] <AsherMaximum> <cherishbridal> I can't really see what's going on from that snippet. I looked at you main site, which appears to be completely broken
[12:45:32] * muzone is now playing: http://home.no/mritz/bts_2006.mp3
[12:45:34] <AsherMaximum> if you can send me a link to the form you are trying to clear at the appropriate time I might be able to help
[12:46:52] <AsherMaximum> <Protomega> are you sure it's not? I just changed the weight of product-id "cb-28"
[12:47:12] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum> thanks.. its not really a main site . more of a dumping ground for things I am working with..    youll find the homepage at http://chicfreakz.co.uk/navigation2.html  then hover over about us and click contact us
[12:47:18] <Protomega> AsherMaximum, did it update the table without having to refresh?
[12:47:41] <AsherMaximum> no
[12:47:45] <Protomega> That's the problem.
[12:48:06] <Protomega> Actually right now it's suppose to just spit out an alert which it doesn't do
[12:48:07] <kborchers> cherishbridal: if i remember your code correctly, move your reset into your ajaxComplete
[12:48:10] <AsherMaximum> but hte table does update in the DB? (That is, i'm assuming you are using a db
[12:48:13] <ericincoldohio> eh just ad what I sent to your dialog declaration
[12:48:21] <Protomega> Correct AsherMaximum
[12:49:19] <Lomex> hey, I want an element to stay at current horizontal position but scroll with the content, can anyone help me doing this?
[12:49:43] <AsherMaximum> protomega: there's now way that i can think of to update the table after the db is updated without doing a refresh
[12:50:05] <ezrafree> hello
[12:50:09] <AsherMaximum> you could simulate it by finding the element in the table and changing it
[12:50:22] <AsherMaximum> but that's about the only thing i can think of
[12:50:23] <ezrafree> anyone know how i can get colorbox to start again with all it's same settings as the last time it was run?
[12:50:29] <Protomega> AsherMaximum, yea that's what I'm trying to do.
[12:50:36] <Protomega> The problem is I need the data from the callback
[12:50:37] <ezrafree> or as it's current settings its running with at the moment even
[12:50:41] <BillCriswell> Lomex: http://limpid.nl/lab/css/fixed/header-and-footer ?
[12:50:43] <Protomega> WHich the callback isn't being executed
[12:51:14] <AsherMaximum> protomega: btw, your links keep going down
[12:51:38] <Lomex> BillCriswell: That won't help. I want the element, where ever it is after loading page. to stay at horizontal position but scroll with my page
[12:51:45] <Protomega> AsherMaximum, yea that's because it's a temporary link to my localhost
[12:52:19] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum> think I am putting it in the wrong place though as its clearing the form even when validation goes back if an item is incorrect
[12:52:43] <m0dmd> good day everyone!
[12:52:47] <cherishbridal> pretty sure thats just cos I may hace it in the wrong place
[12:52:56] <cherishbridal> have even
[12:54:20] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum> pretty sure its just cos its in the wrong place as if someone forgets to do the catchpa it clears everything rather than goes back
[12:54:28] <AsherMaximum> protomega: lemme make sure i have it right: You want to send the data to a page through ajax, and the results from that page will tell you what data has been updated in the table, and the the jQuery function will be run after the request is complete to process it?
[12:55:04] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum>: pretty sure its just cos its in the wrong place as if someone forgets to do the catchpa it clears everything rather than goes back
[12:55:06] <AsherMaximum> cherishbridal: what form on the site are you working with?
[12:55:23] <cherishbridal> super ajax contact form
[12:55:26] <BillCriswell> Lomex: position: fixed?
[12:55:52] <Lomex> BillCriswell: For fixed I need to set the correct distance to left/right/bottom/top
[12:55:55] <Lomex> But I don't know these values
[12:56:03] <Lomex> Since its a matter of content displayed
[12:56:11] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum>: http://resellscripts.info/ajax%20contact%20form
[12:56:16] <schuranator> Can someone help me out on this. When I make this call I get just a basic statusText but if I copy the link it returns the session id json object. http://pastebin.com/8iA96tx5
[12:57:49] <ezrafree> http://jsfiddle.net/yd8RW/ <- can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong here
[12:58:17] <ezrafree> i'm trying to get colorbox to launch another lightbox again with all the same settings as before
[12:58:46] <ezrafree> but i kind of end up in an endless loop trying to pass the "onComplete:" section in colorbox()
[12:59:13] <ezrafree> it's seems maybe my variable of "colorboxSettings" isn't properly being passed or something?
[12:59:22] <kborchers> schuranator: see ?ajax and look at the section on the jqXHR object
[12:59:23] <bot-t> schuranator, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:59:28] <cherishbridal> <AsherMaximum>: also it uses a showbox for success confirmation which needs to be cleared re hidden after a certain amount of time or something
[13:01:00] <schuranator> kborchers: when I alert the textStatus it just says error
[13:02:48] <diamonds> http://pastie.org/2179392
[13:02:58] <diamonds> I take it this is not good javascript :)
[13:03:10] <kborchers> schuranator: you can't pass data like that. it must be properly serialized. the dataType option is for the returned data, not what you are passing.
[13:03:27] <jeffsmykil> can i get another set of eyes please
[13:03:28] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/epjbn1SC
[13:03:43] <jeffsmykil> getting missing ) after argument list
[13:03:47] <jeffsmykil> but i cant figure out where
[13:04:43] <schuranator> kborchers: the return data is json. If I go to the net tab on firebug and right click open link in new window I get the json file that returns the right data.
[13:04:58] <arch_adam> hey all! i have an animation set on hover and mouse out and it works! but if iwere to hover over the buttons very fast it will continiue to animate after, is there any way i can stop this, so whilst in animation do not repeat again?
[13:04:58] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: only thing i notice is that you need semicolons after your appends
[13:05:15] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: worth a try thanks
[13:05:28] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: nope
[13:05:29] <jeffsmykil> no go
[13:05:58] <kborchers> schuranator: right, but you are trying to send data as a JSON object and that doesn't work. it must be in the format x=1&y=2&.....
[13:06:40] <schuranator> kborchers: oh ok I'll try that
[13:07:34] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: then your error must be higher up in the code cuz from what i can tell, everything else looks oj
[13:07:35] <kborchers> ok
[13:07:50] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: all there is is a document.ready
[13:08:09] <cherishbridal> can anyone help me with a problem clearing a contact form in a modal box..  Ashermaximn was assisting me but has just left the session..
[13:08:26] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/1Lfj0EQ5
[13:08:29] <bdev> i have a $form.submit function that I call $.ajax() and e.preventDefault() inside. Is there a way I can call the preventDefault only if $.ajax errors? I tried variables and timeout neither worked?
[13:09:01] <schuranator> kborchers: So I made it a querystring for the data instead and it didn't work still get the fail msg
[13:09:32] <BillCriswell> Lomex: Can't use percentages?
[13:12:24] <BillCriswell> Lomex: http://bill.dev/ha.html like this?
[13:12:28] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: hmmm
[13:12:39] <Lomex> BillCriswell: Not working for me :(
[13:13:22] <BillCriswell> wait wait
[13:13:31] <kborchers> schuranator: can you post updated code?
[13:13:31] <BillCriswell> http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/ha.html sorry, local machine link haha
[13:14:16] <schuranator> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/VthFmasi
[13:14:36] <Lomex> BillCriswell: Yes like that, but always right of the yellow even if you don't know where the yellow one will be exactly rendered :D
[13:14:58] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: I know rite?!
[13:15:33] <gartenstuhl> hi
[13:15:47] <kborchers> schuranator: not sure if this is the issue now but you still need your dataType: 'json" if that is what's being returned
[13:16:11] <schuranator> I had that but most of removed it on the pase
[13:16:30] <BillCriswell> Lomex: Is the orange one a fixed width?
[13:16:38] <Lomex> Nope
[13:17:03] <schuranator> kborchers: I had that but most of removed it on the paste. I did try jsonp and it returns the values but gives me a callback error which is weird.
[13:17:50] <kborchers> that's because with jsonp you have to have the callback. is viddler.com your domain or external? if it's not yours, you have to use jsonp see ?sop
[13:17:50] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:18:29] <yurakeshi> jquery-ui autocomplete is not firing select and change events, any ideas?
[13:18:35] <gartenstuhl> is there a solution to handle json data coming over websocket. I mean a handler which starts the right functions eg: websocket->json: {drawImage: 'image1', writeTextToDiv: 'got Image'} -> handle json -> start the appropriate function -> drawImage('image1'); writeTextToDiv('got Image')
[13:19:23] <schuranator> kborchers: yeah it's external it's some video service
[13:22:10] <kborchers> yurakeshi: if you're still using that combobox thing, not sure what to tell you since it creates the autocomplete and not you. any reason your using that combobox thing and not just a scrollable autocomplete?
[13:24:46] <yurakeshi> kborchers, i'm talking about the autocomplete now. The combobox passes select and change callbacks to autocomplete(), and thoses are not being called.
[13:25:37] <BillCriswell> Lomex: http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/ha.html like this?
[13:25:47] <devinrolsen> anyone ever had any success with using the jquery validate plugin on a form that has dynamically added elements?
[13:26:23] <devinrolsen> so user can keep adding rows of fields depending on how many say shoes they want to buy... but each added new row needs to be validated prior to submitting.
[13:26:24] <ryanneufeld> anyone around that could give me a hand with updating a pull request on github?
[13:26:58] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: maybe, what are you trying to do
[13:27:13] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: I amended a commit
[13:27:21] <ryanneufeld> and it's showing up in my fork and patch
[13:27:22] <soc42> cya next time
[13:27:27] <soc42> thanks sec1:
[13:27:30] <ryanneufeld> but it's not showing up the pull request
[13:27:42] <soc42> and nity night
[13:27:46] <ryanneufeld> I did it before, but I can't remember what I did now
[13:28:18] <Lomex> BillCriswell: I got it working now. many thanks ;-)
[13:28:45] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:29:44] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: nvm, it's in the pull
[13:29:55] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at the master of my branch
[13:30:03] <ryanneufeld> derp
[13:30:06] <fontzter> anyone know the times for the Boston conference?  I'm booking air and want to be there in time.
[13:30:19] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: ok, good.  i was quite confused as to how it could be in your fork but not the pull.
[13:32:03] <Itrace> Is there a plug in or something that will enable CSS transform to IE?
[13:32:31] <kborchers> fontzter: i am flying in friday night. i think it starts pretty early so would be hard to arrive in the morning
[13:33:49] <fontzter> kborchers: I'm trying to avoid the extra $273 night stay.  Airtran has a flight arriving 7:50am.
[13:35:19] <ajpiano> fontzter: that would be fine
[13:35:22] <ajpiano> we start at like, 9
[13:35:28] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: < is a reserved charachter have to escape it
[13:35:46] <kborchers> fontzter: last Boston conf had reg between 9 and 10 with welcome at 10 so that should work
[13:36:14] <fontzter> thanks guys.  How about end time on Sunday.  Any guesses?
[13:36:19] <daninma> i need to target a form input field value  with a name value of Start Date. I tried $("#aspnetform input").find("[title=Start Date]").val() btu it's not working. any suggestions?
[13:36:25] <Itrace> Anybody know of a way to enable CSS transform in IE? I just need to rotate an element.
[13:36:44] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: doh!
[13:37:02] <radost> I want to find all checked checkboxes with a specific name, but this is not working --   $('input[name="distributors"][type="checkbox"][:checked]').size()
[13:37:11] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: yeah no kidding ;)
[13:37:22] <radost> it not limiting by just checked boxes
[13:37:56] <Guest5843> hey i am in need of some jquery assistance if anyone is available
[13:38:17] <snover> ?anyone
[13:38:18] <bot-t> (6 hours 37 mins ago) <nimbu> tell snover ah thnxiess. Can haz suggestions for unit test on normalize github?
[13:38:18] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[13:38:47] <Guest5843> I need to convert  <div> elements on a page into <textareas>'s while maintaining it's original content in each
[13:38:54] <BillCriswell> radost: They're all named "distributors" exactly?
[13:39:05] <snover> Guest5843: are you sure you don’t need to enable contenteditable?
[13:39:34] <Guest5843> im pretty sure
[13:39:40] <radost> BillCriswell: yes
[13:40:07] <timmywil_> radost: $('input:checkbox[name="distributors"]').length
[13:40:43] <radost> timmywil_: Will that limit to just checked checkboxes though?
[13:41:05] <timmywil_> ah, then $('input:checked[name="distributors"]').length
[13:41:09] <BillCriswell> radost: I think you want... $('input:checked[name=distributors]') ?
[13:41:18] <BillCriswell> Not sure what [:checked] is.
[13:41:44] <fontzter> radost: try $('input:checked[name="distributors"]').size();
[13:43:15] <radost> fontzter, BillCriswell, timmywil_ :  it's working thanks
[13:43:22] <Guest5843> so far i can get my code to target a specific div but i am unsure as to how to get all of them
[13:43:24] <BillCriswell> radost: Sweet.
[13:44:01] <fontzter> radost: as long as you don't have radios by the same name.
[13:44:21] <radost> BillCriswell: ":checked"   was something on a jquery cheat sheet for form selectors, I probably wasn't using it properly
[13:44:32] <BillCriswell> radost: Word.
[13:44:40] <Styles> Hey guys, on http://www.yellowpages.com/ what's the component that they use for the search box?
[13:46:14] <Guest5843> <script> $(document).ready(function(){ 						   var content=$("div.leftCol").text(); $("div.leftCol").replaceWith("<textarea class='leftCol'></textarea>"); $(".leftCol").html(content); 						   }); </script>
[13:46:38] <kborchers> ?p @ Guest5843
[13:46:38] <bot-t> Guest5843, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:46:43] <bdev> Anybody know if I can a pass an event into $.ajax({}); ?
[13:47:12] <timmywil_> radost: but you'll get better performance with a filter $('input[name="distributors"]').filter(':checked')
[13:47:30] <kborchers> Guest5843: do all of your divs have the leftCol class?
[13:47:31] <Guest5843> that doesnt really help me though. just shows me what i already knows what happens
[13:47:38] <radost> timmywil_: thanks for the tip
[13:47:42] <timmywil_> np
[13:47:51] <Guest5843> sorry, no not all divs
[13:47:57] <kborchers> Guest5843: the point was to not paste your code here
[13:47:57] <Guest5843> i just selected a specific one to test it
[13:48:27] <BillCriswell> That's weird.. :checked can do input:checked[name=blah] or input[name=blah]:checked awesome.
[13:48:33] <Guest5843> im unsure as to how i would change it so that it would change all the divs and keep their content
[13:48:39] <yurakeshi> kborchers, do you have experience extending jquery ui?
[13:48:45] <kborchers> you need a way to select all of the divs, whether they have a common class, common parent, something that you can use to select all of them.
[13:49:05] <kborchers> Guest5843: ^^^
[13:49:08] <opra> Is it possible to load json arrays sequentially with php
[13:49:13] <Guest5843> i tried doing like ("div").each and then using (this).text() but that just messes it all up
[13:49:33] <BillCriswell> Are you using $("div") or actually ("div")
[13:49:56] <Guest5843> $("div")
[13:49:57] <kborchers> Guest5843: right, that will select every div which is probably not what you want
[13:50:16] <ajpiano> Guest5843 $("div").html(function() { return "<textarea name='foo'>"+$(this).text() + "</textarea>";   });
[13:50:17] <kborchers> if you paste your html somewhere we might be able to help with a selector
[13:50:36] <ajpiano> is the basic idea, these other gentlemen are probably correct that you need to refine your selector
[13:52:27] <Guest5843> nah that didn't do it.. that shows one text area and every thing else without any styling or divs
[13:53:27] <Guest5843> would i have to do like $("div").each.html?
[13:53:39] <BillCriswell> Guest5843: ajpiano's code works.
[13:53:53] <Guest5843> well not in my case then
[13:55:29] <diamonds> how can I get the background-position-y?
[13:55:35] <diamonds> does this work crossbrowser?
[13:56:06] <diamonds> it's set like "background: url() 100% 0px no-repeat"
[13:56:23] <kborchers> ?demo @ Guest5843
[13:56:24] <bot-t> Guest5843, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:56:48] <BillCriswell> Guest5843: http://staging.intuitsolutions.net/ha.html is a working example.
[13:57:45] <diamonds> this seems to work $('.img_1').css('backgroundPositionY');
[13:57:45] <kborchers> BillCriswell: you spelled TextArealize wrong ;)
[13:57:49] <diamonds> can I expect this to work in IE?
[13:57:58] <Guest5843> go to www.scweb.ca/~web600g7/Etech
[13:58:24] <BillCriswell> diamonds: Damn good question. No idea.
[13:58:32] <BillCriswell> #css might know better?
[13:58:40] <diamonds> hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[13:58:42] <Guest5843> click log in and enter mforsyth for user and mathforsen for pass
[13:59:56] <BillCriswell> I see JavaScript errors which is probably why the code later on isn't working.
[13:59:57] <k1t> hey folks
[14:00:19] <Krinkle> diamonds: Yes you may expect so, if not it'd probably be a bug in jQuery
[14:00:25] <CherishBridal> hi could someone help me clear a form which has some validation and showboxes for success and errors..  ?  I need to clear the form without the need for a refresh
[14:00:31] <k1t> anyone have an idea of how i'd go about getting the last part ("block-bottom") from this url: http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/ ?
[14:00:41] <k1t> or a good resource on how to something like that
[14:01:32] <Guest5843> so if i made like each div share a class it would probably work?
[14:01:46] <BillCriswell> k1t: Last "part"? Not sure what you mean.
[14:01:46] <kborchers> Guest5843: yes
[14:01:55] <Guest5843> ok i will try
[14:02:28] <k1t> BillCriswell: I need put everything after /products/ into a string, from the url
[14:02:50] <k1t> BillCriswell: am I still being unclear?
[14:03:18] <BillCriswell> k1t: location.href.split('/').slice(3)
[14:03:27] <BillCriswell> Wait no, messed that up.
[14:03:39] <kborchers> Guest5843: or, if it will only be those two, you could do $(".leftCol, .rightCol").....
[14:03:44] <BillCriswell> k1t: location.href.split('/').slice(4)[0] will return "block-bottom"
[14:04:00] <k1t> BillCriswell: and no jq needed, thanks much!
[14:04:03] <Guest5843> no it will be for any editable div on any page
[14:04:04] <k1t> BillCriswell: trying it out now
[14:04:18] <Guest5843> the idea is to allow moderators to edit content on the site
[14:04:35] <kborchers> Guest5843: then i would give them all a shared class like "editable" or something
[14:04:57] <BillCriswell> k1t: If you expect more parts to that url you'd have to modify a bit.
[14:05:09] <Sample> I've javascript experience but just started using jQuery and I'm curious what the difference is between something like: var tag = 'input'; $('.class '+ input) and $('.class').find(input)
[14:05:32] <k1t> BillCriswell: That should get me on the right path at least - I think I got it from here. :]
[14:05:44] <Sample> err, "tag" in the last two of course
[14:05:45] <k1t> BillCriswell: I will have additional parts, but i just needed a general direction to go in
[14:05:49] <BillCriswell> location.href.split('/').slice(4, -1).join('/')
[14:05:55] <BillCriswell> Oh, sorry.
[14:06:05] <BillCriswell> Work is slow today. =/
[14:06:10] <BillCriswell> :( is what I meant.
[14:07:06] <BillCriswell> location.href.split('/').slice(4, -1).join('/') on http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/blah/poopers/ will return "block-bottom/blah/poopers"
[14:08:30] <k1t> BillCriswell: http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?id=2 is what the url would look like
[14:08:53] <Guest5843> so i changed it so that the two divs had classes of "edit" and i changed the script but it still did nothing
[14:09:00] <k1t> BillCriswell: or similar enough, im actually working on making it so i dont need to use a #
[14:09:03] <k1t> so when im on http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?id=2
[14:09:14] <k1t> i need to grab http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/block-bottom.xml
[14:09:22] <k1t> and parse it with jquery, which is cake
[14:09:26] <Guest5843> $("div.edit").html(function() { return "<textarea name='foo'>"+$(this).text() + "</textarea>";   }); is what i changed it to
[14:09:35] <k1t> BillCriswell: so that's actually my full situation
[14:09:47] <k1t> BillCriswell: not to say i need help the whole way - just so you have a better understanding
[14:09:54] <BillCriswell> I got you!
[14:09:59] <BillCriswell> Enjoy it!
[14:10:03] <k1t> :)
[14:10:16] <k1t> yep makin it all dynamic likes
[14:10:23] <k1t> they have lots of these cateories like "block-bottom"
[14:10:52] <BillCriswell> dynamic is fun.
[14:10:58] <CherishBridal> Can someone help me reset a form? having a few issues on where to place the reset.. as its got validation and some show boxes..
[14:11:21] <CherishBridal> should be a two minute job for someone who knows these things
[14:12:02] <BillCriswell> CherishBridal: <input type="reset" value="Reset"/> ?
[14:12:30] <kborchers> CherishBridal: i thought i sent you the solution earlier. you are using ajaxComplete right to show a success message?
[14:12:41] <kborchers> you can put your reset in there
[14:13:31] <CherishBridal> sorry though you had gone offline..  could you help me on where to insert it as it needs to not clear the form until absolutely everything else is done..
[14:13:59] <CherishBridal> <kborchers>: would really appreciate your help if you could..
[14:14:07] <kborchers> CherishBridal: can you send a link to your code again
[14:14:35] <CherishBridal> http://chicfreakz.co.uk/assets/js/js.js
[14:15:37] <CherishBridal> form is situated at http://chicfreakz.co.uk/navigation2.html   under contact us which is under about us..
[14:16:15] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: I answered this question for you this morning
[14:16:21] <necromancer> hahaha!
[14:16:23] <necromancer> "js/js.js"
[14:16:24] <necromancer> jesus christ
[14:16:32] <ryanneufeld> I was very specific about where to put the code
[14:16:36] <kborchers> necromancer: lol
[14:16:52] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: that would be js/jc.js
[14:17:01] <necromancer> lol
[14:17:36] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: you need to put this.reset() infront of your return false in the form submit function
[14:17:38] <CherishBridal> it didnt do it though as it cleared the form before it had finished as if validation picked anything up it would have cleared the form on submit.. the validation checks upon submit
[14:17:50] <kborchers> CherishBridal: your issue is most likely that you need a semicolon after Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['success']) and before this.reset();
[14:18:33] <ryanneufeld> Which goes back to the other thing i told you
[14:18:43] <ryanneufeld> clean up your code, it's a formatting mess
[14:19:07] <kborchers> CherishBridal: it is very hard to follow
[14:19:52] <CherishBridal> i know.. its a scripted ajax form
[14:20:10] <ryanneufeld> your JS was typed by you ?
[14:20:18] <ryanneufeld> is it generated?
[14:20:21] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/vA2BH/
[14:20:26] <ryanneufeld> that's a good example of formatting
[14:25:06] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>:Its a generated script
[14:25:41] <bigman_randy> hey guys, I'm animating objects to move right along my page. I want to be able to test when that object has reached a certain point, and reset it's position so it can move again
[14:26:11] <bigman_randy> var cloudT1Right = $("img.cloudtop1").attr("right"); should return an integer right?
[14:26:30] <bigman_randy> well cloudT1Right should be an integer
[14:26:48] <bigman_randy> is this correct?
[14:29:03] <DofLeFou> How to get the value the select item in the dropdown list
[14:29:27] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>: Didnt work.. its sticking at the ajax loading now after showing the success box but not returning and not returning to a clear form
[14:29:31] <DofLeFou> http://jsfiddle.net/kjjgm/2/
[14:30:00] <notjrbauer> does anyone have any alternatives to jcarosel lite? mine keeps messing up
[14:30:15] <DofLeFou> I m trying $('#MasterName').val() where MasterName is the ID of my drop down list
[14:30:18] <DofLeFou> but no luck
[14:30:39] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: where is the form?
[14:30:58] <CherishBridal> the actual form that was downloaded?
[14:31:17] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>: the actual form that was downloaded?
[14:31:18] <ryanneufeld> Where can I see the form you're working with
[14:31:40] <ryanneufeld> show me the form that this javascript code is being used with
[14:32:24] <CherishBridal> it was from here http://resellscripts.info/ajax%20contact%20form
[14:32:44] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>: it was from here http://resellscripts.info/ajax%20contact%20form
[14:33:18] <ryanneufeld> *sigh*
[14:33:23] <ryanneufeld> Where, on your site
[14:33:26] <ryanneufeld> is the form
[14:33:38] <ryanneufeld> so I can see the problem you are having
[14:35:46] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: have you looked at your error console?
[14:35:50] <ryanneufeld> to see what's going on?
[14:37:58] <TrueColors> Has anyone any experience with the facebook developer tools, like the like button?
[14:40:50] <BillCriswell> TrueColors: I just go to addthis.com and copy and paste that code.
[14:42:03] <TrueColors> i only care about facebook haha.
[14:42:06] <TrueColors> i just can't figure it out
[14:42:14] <TrueColors> i tried a click function but because it worksl ike an iframe, not quite possible :/
[14:42:57] <BillCriswell> TrueColors: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/ didn't help?
[14:43:03] <Zzaichik> developers.facebook.com gives you the code you want...
[14:43:05] <notjrbauer> facebook api site has their own plugin generator
[14:43:08] <notjrbauer> ^
[14:43:50] <TrueColors> I have the like buttons
[14:44:07] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld> just seen your test mails.. did they clear or did it stick
[14:44:16] <TrueColors> I just would like to display teh 20 most liked posts.
[14:44:16] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:44:25] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: did you look at your console?
[14:44:31] <TrueColors> It says nothing
[14:44:44] <notjrbauer> i'm getting qa'd to hell on this jcaroselgallery, can anyone take a look at it for me? :-\
[14:45:10] <notjrbauer> ill paypal you a case of beer
[14:45:21] <chainwork> Did someone say beer?
[14:45:24] <CherishBridal> its saying.. Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'reset'
[14:45:34] <BillCriswell> TrueColors: Take a look at the Graph API.
[14:45:39] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>:its saying.. Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'reset'
[14:45:59] <ryanneufeld> what browser are you using?
[14:46:14] <BillCriswell> Are you running reset on a form element or an input?
[14:47:06] <BillCriswell> TrueColors: You might be better off looking in #facebook.
[14:47:13] <BillCriswell> s/looking/asking
[14:47:24] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>: chrome but I can test on all
[14:47:34] <TrueColors> i did ask in there
[14:47:36] <TrueColors> they're all inactive
[14:47:37] <ryanneufeld> try it with firebug
[14:47:44] <ryanneufeld> and add a console.log(this)
[14:47:49] <ryanneufeld> I'd like to see what it is
[14:49:24] <BillCriswell> TrueColors: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/application/ might have some interesting information for you
[14:49:57] <BillCriswell> http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/?method=GET&path=2439131959 is an api explorer... You might have to grant the application acdess to your profile to check out the "connections"
[14:50:30] <notjrbauer> has anyone ever used jcarosellite and have it choke up sometimes
[14:50:54] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: $('#contactForm').get(0).reset()
[14:51:41] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld> says the same in firebug..
[14:51:59] <notjrbauer> :[
[14:52:04] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'reset'
[14:52:40] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>: where shall I stick that instead?
[14:53:17] <ryanneufeld> instead of this.reset();
[14:53:22] <ryanneufeld> clearly this is in the wrong context
[14:53:50] <ryanneufeld> add console.log(this); next to it too
[14:54:09] <ryanneufeld> then look at your console and you'll see what it actually is
[14:55:12] <CherishBridal>   <ryanneufeld> : so this instead.   Form.showBox('#' + Form.id['success']);  		 $('#contactForm').get(0).reset(); console.log(this);  }else if($return === false)
[14:55:23] <ryanneufeld> yes
[14:56:00] <CherishBridal>   <ryanneufeld> : will give it a try.. :) fingers crossed
[14:57:16] <larzen-wrk> Folks.. i am using jqueryui tabs... and I use the following call to set a tab into focus: $('#tabs').tabs({ selected: 0 });  -- everything works well in ff/safar but IE7 bleeds the content from the last focus tab.... any suggestions/ help?
[14:58:50] <CherishBridal>   <ryanneufeld> : Well it cleared the form.. but didnt close / rehide the show box.. is this something seperate that needs to be tagged at the end?
[14:59:04] <CherishBridal> it did a console dump too if you wanna see it..
[15:00:15] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: sec
[15:00:54] <CherishBridal> <ryanneufeld>: no worries..  really appreciate this ...
[15:06:40] <aaairc> would any of you have a suggestion on how to make the "#hiddenBox" div that pops up in this example, stay centered when the browser is resized?   http://jsfiddle.net/pDgeu/
[15:07:13] <DofLeFou> Dear JQuery GOD
[15:07:23] <DofLeFou> How do one refresh a table using ajax?
[15:07:33] <aaairc> i have it now so that when it pops up, it is centered... its just when i resize the browser the absolute positioning doesn't adjust to reflect that
[15:08:49] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: I see what's going on now
[15:09:13] <CherishBridal>  <ryanneufeld>: ok cool
[15:09:28] <ryanneufeld> CherishBridal: basically the plugin you're using is dynamically creating that html
[15:09:53] <CherishBridal>  <ryanneufeld>: correct.
[15:09:56] <ryanneufeld> but in the context of the call back this is the Form object you've bound it to
[15:10:03] <ryanneufeld> not a form element as it typically is
[15:10:21] <ryanneufeld> so if you had a normal form, then my original suggestion would have worked
[15:10:28] <CherishBridal> ok
[15:10:41] <CherishBridal> does this mean I am in trouble again or is there a way around it?
[15:11:12] <ryanneufeld> no
[15:11:16] <ryanneufeld> you're okay
[15:11:24] <CherishBridal> phew ...
[15:12:03] <CherishBridal> really appreicate your help on this..

[16:47:33] <aaairc> it doesn't happen in firefox

[16:48:55] <Patabugen> I'm trying to write a plugin, which uses another plugin $().slider() in this case. It's saying "slider is not a funciton, what might I be doing wrong?
[16:49:12] <[N]asser`> actually, don't worry about it i figured it out
[16:49:38] <aaairc> anyone know how to fix it? the div that is leaving a trail of its previous position behind... is positioned with position:absolute; left: 0; right:0;... so it is updated when the browser is expanded on shrunk... and when it shrinks, its like the position where it was at doesn't get repainted if the resize happens quickly. if i resize very slowly though the image doesn't leave a trail.
[16:50:15] <necr0tik> [N]asser`, you are a dumbass. that is all.
[16:53:08] <Patabugen> Do I need to do anything special to require/use another plugin from within a plugin?
[16:54:18] <Patabugen> Or perhaps I'm just having trouble using $.slider with a class-based selector?
[16:59:19] <d4rklit3> jesster  when you say display which value is hidden?

[17:23:57] <devinrolsen> Hey, I got a form that allows the visitor to add additional fields. But not sure how one can validate newly added fields. http://tinyurl.com/3m7rtqv is my code, if you click "Add another" a few times and click submit, you will see what I'm talking about.
[17:24:02] <devinrolsen> any suggestions?
[17:26:52] <aaairc> Anyone familiar with the Fancybox "Elastic" Effect? You can see it here: http://blog.moskis.net/downloads/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/ if you scroll down and click on the Images Demo. I would like to do this effect for a popup on my site, without using Fancybox... but don't really know where to get started. Does anyone know of a tutorial or example code?
[17:31:29] <Dangr_> aaairc, why not just use fancybox?
[17:31:31] <faianca> Hi Guys, I got a form, and im getting some Inputs through an $.ajax call, but when i try to submit the form , that inputs i created doesnt appear on $_POST, i tried live.('submit', any knows? Cheeeeers
[17:32:36] <ravenzz> ?paste @ faianca
[17:32:36] <bot-t> faianca, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:35:11] <faianca> ravenzz, http://jsfiddle.net/t6grL/ its what i got now, but it doesnt post the "ajax" input's
[17:36:36] <aaairc> Dangr_: I'm new to web development, so this may not make sense. But I figured if all I needed was just that simple Elastic Effect for a pop-up, it didn't make sense to have all the additional Fancybox code incorporated into my site. Also, the overlay that Fancybox has wasn't working on my site when I initially tested it, and more to the point there are some specific things I would like to do in terms of making my pop-up moveable o
[17:36:37] <aaairc> page, and how the content within it can be updated that I thought FancyBox might complicate.
[17:38:25] <techouse_> how do i get the euro sign with jquery?
[17:38:26] <aaairc> Dangr_: another thing is that FancyBox made it so when my popup appeared, I couldn't do mousewheel scrolling on my page when I was hovering over the popup, which I didn't like
[17:38:31] <techouse_> &euro; didn't work :/
[17:39:11] <ravenzz> faianca you got a form, then (after an ajax request) some input fields are filled?
[17:39:50] <faianca> ravenzz, i got a form with some inputs, and i do an ajax call to get a few more, and when i click submit, the ajax response inputs, do not appear in that form post
[17:39:52] <ravenzz> and after the submit the $_POST array is empty?
[17:39:55] <faianca> yes
[17:40:03] <faianca> the post array its not empty
[17:40:08] <faianca> it still has the static post
[17:40:21] <faianca> and im pretty sure that all the html its working properly, and im using the latest jquery
[17:40:27] <beasty> morning all
[17:40:45] <ravenzz> i would take a look at the ajax request's callback
[17:41:07] <Dangr_> aaairc- hmm those are good thoughts but you can also get a min version perhaps. You'll have to write a plug-in to do the animation. Perhaps a place to start is to read the Fancybox source and see how they do the elastic effect. Also the overlay is typically something like a png. You shoud check the css and perhaps that is the reason it isn't showing up corretly. There are a lot of tutorials on creating modals though.
[17:41:15] <ravenzz> the one that adds some field/values to your form
[17:41:48] <ravenzz> morning beasty, even though here is late night :]
[17:42:01] <beasty> is there a way to trigger a change event ?
[17:42:11] <beasty> 2:42 am inhere :)
[17:42:19] <Dangr_> You can try someting like this: http://raventools.com/blog/create-a-modal-dialog-using-css-and-javascript/ and its pretty simple but id just use fancybox or colorbox since there is a variety of options available that can be of great benefit. You can also perhaps take the time to edit the source to keep what you need but the plugins are reasonably small and effective i dont see a knock against especially if you are using the HTML5 bo
[17:42:19] <Dangr_> ilerplate you can keep net requests to a minimum
[17:42:21] <ravenzz> uep
[17:42:34] <ravenzz> beasty the same here :p
[17:42:44] <ravenzz> ?change @ beasty
[17:42:44] <bot-t> beasty, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[17:43:42] <beasty> .trigger('change'); worked also
[17:43:49] <beasty> and define them after the events :)
[17:44:27] <ravenzz> "This method is a shortcut for .bind('change', handler) in the first two variations, and .trigger('change') in the third."
[17:47:54] <aaairc> Dangr_: I actually figured out how to do the modal, positioning, controlling the popup etc with just jQuery directly... the last piece of the puzzle was just figuring out how to get that elastic effect. I've never written a plugin (i only learned jQuery/javascript yesterday) but will check out how hard it is to do that. Maybe I'll get a book from the library tomorrow or something, to help guide me. I'll also try and take a close l
[17:47:54] <aaairc> the FancyBox source and see if I can figure it out.
[17:48:36] <Dangr_> aaairc- if you are a Paul Irish fan you might enjoy this hot read: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[17:49:39] <aaairc> Dangr_: thanks. Not a fan of anyone yet, as I just started learning all this web stuff in the last couple weeks. so far I've been using Lynda.com video tutorials... kinda slow, but nice in that the walk you through every step. That is what I used as an intro into jQuery.
[17:49:40] <Dangr_> aaairc- it explains how to write a plug-in and pretty much everything you would need to know about javascript and jquery in order to get started. Plus - the best part - its free. The library will likely have an outdated version of jQuery or Javascript or both.
[17:50:00] <aaairc> Dangr_: cool thanks! i'll def give it a read.
[17:50:52] <Dangr_> aaairc- Lynda is OK but I would recommend checking out that site and Paul Irish's site www.paulirish.com he's a leader at jQuery, developed the HTML5 boilerplate, Modernizr, pretty much all the good stuff front-end Web developers use he's made it.

[18:39:22] <d4rklit3> is jquery compliant with ie7?
[18:39:37] <d4rklit3> i feel like simple shit like $(element).click() doesn't work
[18:40:14] <devinrolsen> well verbatim, yes d4rklit3, that would not work.
[18:40:20] <devinrolsen> but yes it's IE7 ready.
[18:42:07] <swiggy> i want to create an function/callback on blur but only for the LAST element (textarea) in a container [http://jsfiddle.net/45QPp/] i know how to make the .bind('blur'), but how do i tell if its the last element?
[18:42:20] <swiggy> ie i do not want it to fire if it is slide 2, only slide 3
[18:42:26] <swiggy> but there can be more than 3 slides
[18:43:00] <ajpiano> swiggy: is(":last-child") might work
[18:43:13] <d4rklit3> devinrolsen what do u mean verbatim
[18:43:22] <d4rklit3> how would i make element.click() work in ie7?
[18:43:37] <ajpiano> $("foo").click(fn) works just fine in IE7
[18:43:58] <d4rklit3> doesn't work for me
[18:44:10] <d4rklit3> is it that ie7 doesn't let u click on images?
[18:44:13] <d4rklit3> or div tags?
[18:44:23] <ajpiano> nope.
[18:44:31] <d4rklit3> I QUIT THIS SHIT !
[18:44:34] <swiggy> last-child
[18:44:36] <d4rklit3> you gottta be kidding me
[18:44:37] <ajpiano> it's that click, etc, works fine in ie7 and you are likely doing something else wrong
[18:44:38] <swiggy> is firing everytime
[18:44:44] <d4rklit3> how do you people do this?
[18:44:46] <swiggy> im creating the blur event on the textarea
[18:44:48] <d4rklit3> saints, all of you
[18:44:52] <ajpiano> swiggy: i didn't get a good look at your dom
[18:45:09] <swiggy> textarea id=slidetext<NUM> class=mceEditor
[18:45:14] <ajpiano> you'd have to do the is(":last-child") test on the element that *should* be the last child of its container
[18:45:18] <swiggy> but each has its own fieldset and div wrapper
[18:45:22] <swiggy> inside a parent div
[18:45:28] <ajpiano> right
[18:45:36] <devinrolsen> d4rklit3, why don't you pastebin.com us a sample of your attempted jquery that is failing in IE7.
[18:45:41] <ajpiano> so you would have to check the .closest("div")
[18:45:44] <swiggy> <div> <div><field><text></field></div>  <div><field><text></field></div> </div>
[18:46:22] <d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/2180719
[18:46:23] <ajpiano> if ($(this).closest("div").is(":last-child")) { }
[18:46:28] <d4rklit3> alt is a <div>
[18:47:55] <devinrolsen> why dont you throw an alert in there before the fbLogin(); and run IE7 again, if you get an alert, then its not jquery.
[18:48:00] <swiggy> $(this) = textarea?
[18:48:00] <devinrolsen> alert('test');
[18:48:11] <swiggy> bc my blur is on the textarea
[18:48:16] <ajpiano> d4rklit3 http://jsfiddle.net/9ZJmD/1/ open that in ie7
[18:48:21] <ajpiano> swiggy, probably, yes.
[18:48:33] <swiggy> yeah then its not 'working' its firing every time still
[18:48:36] <miketaylr> ie7 is weird sometimes with not being able to click an element unless it has enough padding around the text
[18:49:00] <ajpiano> swiggy: you know there is a point where you have to take the concepts i am talking about and perhaps apply them to your code
[18:49:16] <swiggy> just out of energy lol 10hr day
[18:49:21] <d4rklit3> then wtf
[18:49:24] <d4rklit3> why doesn't mine work
[18:49:25] <d4rklit3> in ie7
[18:49:25] <ajpiano> i'm not going to sit there and work apart the completly line-break-less html and non-functional javascript you pasted in that fiddle
[18:49:26] <ajpiano> :p
[18:49:49] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, you probably have some other error in your code, like a trailing comma in an object literal, etc
[18:49:59] <devinrolsen> ajpiano, are you familiar with the validation plugin? I'm really stuck.
[18:50:04] <devinrolsen> http://tinyurl.com/3m7rtqv
[18:50:06] <ajpiano> i am not, i've never done anything with it
[18:50:11] <ajpiano> i know of it, obviously
[18:50:32] <d4rklit3> devinrolsen and there is no way to figure out where this is?
[18:50:37] <devinrolsen> yeah, I've used it many times.. but this time I feel like I have painted my self in a deep corner now lol.
[18:50:48] <devinrolsen> where what is?
[18:51:06] <miketaylr> d4rklit3: do you have any javascript errors on the page in ie7?
[18:51:12] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, are you using developer tools from ie8 or ie9, or some other script editor
[18:51:13] <ajpiano> ?
[18:51:20] <ajpiano> it will show you if ie is throwing actual errors
[18:51:39] <ajpiano> devinrolsen: fwiw, i wouldn't clone that stuff, i would use a template and then apply the validation to new elements
[18:52:00] <ajpiano> not sure if that would fix it, but, uch... clone
[18:52:51] <devinrolsen> ok so some hidden version off from view that I can pull from?
[18:53:12] <d4rklit3> im using ie9
[18:53:15] <ajpiano> yea like.... templating
[18:53:20] <d4rklit3> and viewign in ie7 standards mode
[18:53:30] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, and when you put it in ie7 mode, there are no errors in the console?
[18:54:08] <swiggy> ajpiano - http://jsfiddle.net/45QPp/1/ if that helps :D
[18:54:18] <d4rklit3> trailing commas
[18:54:18] <d4rklit3> thanks
[18:54:30] <d4rklit3> i forgot i took channel: "url" out of my fb.init() call
[18:54:32] <d4rklit3> left the comma
[18:54:33] <ajpiano> there you go, boom.
[18:54:59] <devinrolsen> boom = epic.
[18:55:04] <d4rklit3> going home
[18:55:06] <d4rklit3> time for starcraft
[18:55:44] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/45QPp/2/
[18:55:50] <swiggy> the textarea is where the blur event should fire
[18:56:02] <swiggy> when any of those are blurr'd but only if it is the last one do i want 'work' done
[18:56:10] <ajpiano> LAST of what
[18:56:23] <ajpiano> the last like, slide?
[18:56:24] <swiggy> last in the container id #scriptandslidecontiner
[18:56:25] <miketaylr> that looks like...the first slide
[18:56:32] <swiggy> it is the first
[18:56:41] <swiggy> but i only want the event to fire on the last
[18:56:46] <swiggy> that is part of the parent div id scriptandslidecontiner
[18:56:51] * miketaylr am confused
[18:56:58] <swiggy> which is the parent wrapper for all the <divs>
[18:57:00] <ajpiano> the last what, div inside the div inside the form inside that
[18:57:32] <swiggy> <div id='scriptandslidecontiner'> <div id='slide#'s> <fieldset> <textarea> </fieldset> </div> </div>
[18:57:47] <swiggy> if it is the last <div> of scriptandslidecontiner
[18:57:48] <devinrolsen> ajpiano, sorry to seem dense here, but I'm not understanding what you mean by template. So you are saying having these two fields elsewhere on the page that I can do something like $(container).append($(template).html()); ??
[18:58:26] <devinrolsen> or put the templates html into a object that I append.
[18:58:56] <ajpiano> you can put a javascript template inside of like, a script tag with a type that is unkonwn by the browser
[18:59:03] <ajpiano> or load it in via ajax
[18:59:05] <swiggy> $('#scriptandslidecontiner').closest('textarea').is(':last-child')
[18:59:11] <swiggy> ?
[18:59:16] <ajpiano> swiggy
[18:59:29] <swiggy> im sooo tiredddd
[18:59:35] <ajpiano> $(this).closest("div.draggable").is(":last-child")
[18:59:38] <ajpiano> so am i
[18:59:38] <swiggy> i just spent 2hrs hacking tinymce to allow blur events
[18:59:39] <ajpiano> of your shit
[18:59:39] <ajpiano> :p
[18:59:43] <ajpiano> :/
[19:00:01] <devinrolsen> burn!
[19:00:06] <ajpiano> devinrolsen: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[19:00:17] <swiggy> and again $(this) is textarea/
[19:00:22] <ajpiano> swiggy: you have an element, you need to go to the element containing it that you expect would actually match the condition
[19:00:39] <ajpiano> yes, it is, in a textarea blur event
[19:00:49] <ajpiano> and you shouldnt' be binding things with inline handlers, you should be using $("textarea").blur
[19:00:52] <ajpiano> i mean for gods sake
[19:00:57] <swiggy> im not
[19:01:02] <swiggy> i do not use inline lol
[19:01:15] <ajpiano> then how do you explain this fiddle?
[19:01:21] <swiggy> i have learned that the first week in irc w/ u ;)
[19:01:34] <gurumelo> ?.closest
[19:01:35] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:01:46] <ajpiano> :)
[19:02:07] <swiggy> that is just something that needs binded lol
[19:02:10] <swiggy> seems i missed one
[19:02:21] <GoGoGarrett> What can I use aside from blur -  I'm trying to ensure the number entered the input is not larger than 10
[19:02:44] <swiggy> but ty ajpiano
[19:02:49] <swiggy> works as planned
[19:02:50] <swiggy> now
[19:02:51] <iszak> ajpiano++
[19:02:55] <GoGoGarrett> http://pastebin.com/h7BPREra
[19:03:25] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett, any of the key events?
[19:03:33] <ajpiano> keyup will let you react after the value has been updated
[19:03:46] <GoGoGarrett> hmm
[19:03:49] <GoGoGarrett> I've never messed with it
[19:04:12] <ajpiano> well don't let me stop you
[19:04:13] <GoGoGarrett> but I can validate after their let go of a key
[19:04:18] <GoGoGarrett> and check to see if that input is above 10?
[19:04:23] <ajpiano> yes
[19:04:37] <GoGoGarrett> good deal thanks. i'll look into it
[19:06:02] <Chri_____> anyone know why the variable on line #11 of this pastie isn't compiling? http://pastie.org/2180787
[19:06:29] <k1t> when i view source its outputting "i" (the var name) instead of  the variable itself, an integer
[19:06:31] <andrun> hello, how can I make an array e.g. domains = ["one", "two"], convert it to domains = "one|two" and put it inside a regexp, e.g. /^.+@(domains)$/i ?
[19:07:34] <ajpiano> k1t, huh?
[19:07:40] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks alot ajpiano :]
[19:07:43] <ajpiano> i is a javascript variable
[19:07:57] <ajpiano> it's not going to magically get changed into the value of i inside of that object literal
[19:08:07] <ajpiano> k1t. you may also want to see ?forloopscope
[19:08:08] <bot-t> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[19:09:16] <k1t> ajpiano: http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=coffee-tea
[19:09:19] <k1t> view the source
[19:09:33] <ajpiano> ...right
[19:09:40] <k1t> ajpiano: line 56
[19:09:52] <ajpiano> what would i expect to see there besides "i"
[19:09:53] <k1t> what do you mean ...right
[19:09:55] <k1t> lol
[19:09:59] <k1t> uhm
[19:10:00] <k1t> a number
[19:10:06] <k1t> maybe?
[19:10:06] <k1t> ;x
[19:10:08] <ajpiano> uh
[19:10:21] <ajpiano> you intend for the loop on line 47 to be a javsacript loop, not a php loop or something, right?
[19:10:35] <k1t> ajpiano: rofl why do u say that
[19:10:43] <k1t> ajpiano: yeah, its supposed to be javascript haha
[19:10:47] <k1t> thats messed up man :X
[19:10:47] <k1t> lol
[19:10:49] <ajpiano> k1t: because it seems like your expectations don't make anysense
[19:11:16] <k1t> wow
[19:11:18] <ajpiano> how would loading the javascript in the browser cause it to "compile" the variable and print the value of the variable into the code
[19:11:19] <k1t> i see what youre saying
[19:11:21] <k1t> im being stupid
[19:11:22] <k1t> hold on
[19:11:40] <k1t> i see what i did wrong oops
[19:11:45] <ajpiano> :)
[19:13:22] <LoneStar99> using jquery and not sure why the simplest things do not work --> http://pastebin.com/1K37fNhn
[19:13:53] <ajpiano> cause jQuery uses css selectors
[19:14:00] <ajpiano> $("#content") , not $("content")
[19:14:33] <versatiletech> or $('.content') depending if it's a class or an id
[19:14:53] <ajpiano> i'm assuming it's an id based on him using gEBId the line before it
[19:14:54] <ajpiano> :p
[19:15:13] <versatiletech> $('ANY VALID CSS SELECTOR UP TO CSS3')
[19:15:15] <versatiletech> ha :D
[19:15:36] <k1t> ajpiano: I am pretty sure you're not understanding this
[19:15:38] <k1t> cuz uh
[19:15:39] <k1t> http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=food-ingredients
[19:15:41] <k1t> notice that alert
[19:15:44] <k1t> shows a variable
[19:15:48] <k1t> i
[19:15:51] <k1t> which is a number at that point
[19:16:01] <ajpiano> is that number one higher than the number of slides you have?
[19:16:04] <ajpiano> and you are wondering why that is the case?
[19:16:31] <k1t> no if that were the case itd default to the last one
[19:16:46] <k1t> grr i just want that number that shows in the alert
[19:16:52] <k1t> to be where the i is below it in the has
[19:16:53] <k1t> :/
[19:17:05] <k1t> is that not possible?
[19:17:05] <k1t> lol
[19:17:20] <k1t> with javascript alone i men
[19:17:20] <k1t> mean*
[19:17:31] <k1t> has = hash**
[19:17:35] <LoneStar99> ajpiano: ok that worked, no why does the following not work... $(window.document).bind("mobileinit",function(){$.extend($.mobile,{ajaxFormsEnabled:false,loadingMessage:"Validating..."})});
[19:17:55] <ajpiano> huh?
[19:17:59] <k1t> and idToUse ***
[19:18:44] <k1t> ajpiano: are you still not understanding what i'm trying to do? lol
[19:18:52] <ajpiano> not really.
[19:20:10] <LoneStar99> anyohe here know jquery mobile....
[19:20:51] <ajpiano> LoneStar99: can you check if the mobileinit event is even happening at all?
[19:21:08] <ajpiano> $(document).bind("mobileinit", function(e) {  alert("mobileinit");  });
[19:21:21] <k1t> ok so im looping through an array.. and at a certain point, i want to pass my index (i) to my method nivoSlider, but i want it to pass it the integer value of i
[19:21:23] <iszak> ajpiano, there's a mobile init event? D:
[19:21:26] <Murugaratham> anyone know what is the best way to create radio button function
[19:21:42] <ajpiano> k1t, but what it is it passing instead?
[19:21:45] <ajpiano> iszak, in jqm
[19:21:47] <iszak> Murugaratham, huh? change evnet?
[19:21:50] <iszak> ajpiano, still thats' cool!
[19:22:02] <k1t> ajpiano: it thinks its a string, i
[19:22:02] <k1t> ajpiano: im guessing..
[19:22:18] <ajpiano> k1t, what isn't working that should be
[19:22:29] <Murugaratham> iszak: i want to create a function that accepts a option object to create a radio button
[19:22:33] <Murugaratham> or buttons
[19:22:39] <k1t> ajpiano: ugh my train is landing ill be back in about an hour.. i appreciate your help
[19:22:44] <k1t> though if we dont speak again
[19:22:45] <ajpiano> ok
[19:22:46] <k1t> :)
[19:22:58] <ajpiano> trains arrive, planes la....
[19:23:28] <iszak> Murugaratham, ohhh right
[19:25:05] <LoneStar99> ajpiano: ok tried $(document).bind("mobileinit", function(e) { alert("mobileinit"); }); and negative
[19:27:19] <LoneStar99> ajpiano: so i guess some jquery library is missing?
[19:27:42] <LoneStar99> using --> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js
[19:28:11] <ajpiano> hmm
[19:29:08] <ajpiano> LoneStar99 "Because the mobileinit event is triggered immediately upon execution, you'll need to bind your event handler before jQuery Mobile is loaded."
[19:29:14] <ajpiano> that is from the docs
[19:29:23] <ajpiano> are you loading jquerymobile before creating the handler?
[19:29:34] <ajpiano> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/#/demos/1.0b1/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[19:31:34] <LoneStar99> ajpiano: ok cool reading
[19:33:48] <iszak> Murugaratham, why can't you use $('<input />', {}); ?
[19:35:17] <aaairc> Fancybox Question here... Does anyone know how "orig" works? Can I specify (x,y) coordinates for where the elastic animation should start from?
[19:35:31] <aaairc> i'm using isotope...
[19:36:05] <aaairc> which hides the thumbnail positions... because isotope takes over positioning and you can't pull it from jQuery directly
[19:41:38] <GoGoGarrett> http://pastebin.com/Lfhbb00S  How can I make it when the value is back within valid values that it form is sumitable ag
[19:43:17] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: you have to cancel the submit event, not the click event on the submit button
[19:43:31] <GoGoGarrett> on the first keyup?
[19:43:33] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett, the best thing to do is actually just manipulate the "disabled" attribute of the submit button
[19:43:35] <ajpiano> no
[19:43:39] <ajpiano> you should just ^^
[19:43:46] <ajpiano> instead of adding click events
[19:43:47] <ajpiano> also
[19:43:57] <ajpiano> when you add a click to the input[type=submit] like that
[19:43:59] <ajpiano> it doesn't replace the old one
[19:44:02] <ajpiano> it just stacks a new one
[19:44:11] <ajpiano> so you're just adding lots and lots of handlers, not replacing the old state
[19:44:30] <ajpiano> ALSo, you should put quotes in your attribute selectors =  $("input[name='reservations']");
[19:44:38] <GoGoGarrett> hmm, is there a better way?  $('input').is('submit') ?
[19:44:45] <ajpiano> ALSO, when you do var foo = $("#somejQueryObject"); you don't have to wrap it in $() again
[19:45:04] <vrtigo> ajpiano: some people like to do that
[19:45:07] <ajpiano> var foo = $("#something");  foo.keyup(fn);
[19:45:23] <GoGoGarrett> gotcha
[19:45:27] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah it looks cleaner.
[19:45:27] <ajpiano> vrtigo, some people like a lot of things doesn't make 'em good ideas :p
[19:45:40] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett, best is to just manipulate whether the submit button is disabled, i promise :)
[19:45:53] <GoGoGarrett> so add the attr to the button it's self in the markup?
[19:45:57] <vrtigo> if it works, it works
[19:46:11] <vrtigo> foo could be anything, $(foo) is clearly jquery
[19:46:31] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett, using jquery, depending on the value of the thing
[19:46:32] <ajpiano> 1 sec
[19:46:50] <ajpiano> vrtigo: re wrapping it in jquery because you think it makes your code "more readable" is a really silly thing to do
[19:46:55] <ajpiano> alias the thing with a $foo in that case
[19:47:13] <vrtigo> if you can explain why, ill listen
[19:48:56] <ajpiano> because there's overhead  associated with it
[19:49:12] <vrtigo> is that the only reason?
[19:49:25] <ajpiano> it would be like saying "oh, instantiate a new instance of WhateverWidget any time you access something that should be a WhateverWidget, just in case"
[19:49:28] <ajpiano> it's pointless.
[19:53:13] <GoGoGarrett> if$(this).val() > 10) { $(" input[ type='submit' ] " ).attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[19:53:17] <GoGoGarrett> something like that ajpiano?
[19:53:24] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: yup
[19:53:41] <GoGoGarrett> and just take away the click handler entirely?
[19:53:46] <ajpiano> i would say so
[19:53:57] <ajpiano> then you could have a submit handler in addition
[19:54:10] <ajpiano> that checks if the submit is disabled, and if so, displays a message
[19:57:05] <GoGoGarrett> hm
[19:58:35] <GoGoGarrett> http://pastebin.com/vxmuh7xa  something like this?
[19:59:00] <ajpiano> something like that
[19:59:03] <GoGoGarrett> doesn't seem to stop the form from submitting
[19:59:05] <GoGoGarrett> :/
[19:59:28] <ajpiano> is the function even running at all?
[20:00:17] <GoGoGarrett> nope, hm
[20:00:29] <ajpiano> is it in doc ready
[20:00:37] <GoGoGarrett> yea
[20:01:04] <GoGoGarrett> second might be a syntax error
[20:01:17] <GoGoGarrett> I'm still a noob
[20:01:33] <GoGoGarrett> got it, thanks :]
[20:05:13] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett, here you will probably learn something from this anyway http://jsfiddle.net/nryTK/
[20:09:21] <LoneStar99> ajpiano:  not sure what is going on, what is the simplest way to add a popup menu in jquery?
[20:09:35] <LoneStar99> the mobile stuff does not work for some reason...
[20:09:55] <ajpiano> mobile is not how you'd add a simple popup menu
[20:10:49] <LoneStar99> ajpiano:  the code they provided me does not work, so need another solution
[20:11:08] <LoneStar99> using jquery that is not overkill
[20:11:46] <GoGoGarrett> Sweet thanks a lot man.
[20:12:10] <LoneStar99> ok, brb in 30 minutes need to eat, mobile jquery left me at hello
[20:25:58] <hs2> does anyone know which jquery plugin can accomplish a slide down header nav? like click on table of contents here: http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/
[20:28:30] <versatiletech> hs2: yeah just plain old jQuery
[20:28:40] <hs2> easing plugin?
[20:28:44] <hs2> or is there a plugin for it
[20:29:23] <versatiletech> well I believe jquery comes with a couple of default easings and if you want more you have to include them
[20:29:30] <hs2> ah
[20:29:39] <hs2> thanks!
[20:30:41] <versatiletech> .slideToggle() is probably what you're looking for
[20:30:53] <Vorspire> hs2, you could try using the Accordion in jQuery-UI, it's pretty neat
[20:31:11] <hs2> for a header like that?
[20:31:30] <Vorspire> ohh didn't see the link :P
[20:31:31] <versatiletech> or you just animate the position
[20:31:49] <hs2> ah
[20:31:51] <hs2> hmm
[20:34:00] <Vorspire> hs2
[20:34:01] <Vorspire> var expanded = false; $("button").click(function(){ if(!expanded){ expanded = true; $("#content").slideDown( 500 ); } else { expanded = false; $("#content").slideUp( 500 ); } }
[20:34:30] <Vorspire> then you just need <div id="content"></div><button>Expand</button>
[20:34:45] <Vorspire> and some CSS to hide it initially and position stuff etc
[20:34:52] <hs2> gotcha
[20:35:54] <karega> hey
[20:35:57] <Vorspire> hmm
[20:36:01] <Vorspire> ?slideToggle
[20:36:01] <bot-t> .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[20:36:16] <karega> how can I use the canvas tag in Ie 7
[20:37:13] <Vorspire> hs2, even better: $("button").click(function(){$("#content").slideToggle( 500 ); });
[20:37:27] <hs2> oh nice
[20:39:39] <hs2> dont you love it when the original site was written using jquery and then some later programmer uses jquery for one thing.. and then you come in to fix it
[20:40:08] <Gary_B> ive downloaded a free web template, it uses ie_png.js and PIE.htc and looks pretty poor on ie with scripts disabled. Could the dev have used jquery and not needed these other files?
[20:40:28] <versatiletech> hs2:
[20:40:29] <versatiletech> http://jsbin.com/egopun/2/edit
[20:41:40] <Vorspire> that just repositions the div without actually expanding it :/
[20:41:48] <Vorspire> the element*
[20:48:33] <versatiletech> Vorspire: yeah, mimics the table of contents he showed us http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/ ;)
[20:48:59] <Vorspire> if you add more content to that <p> you'll find it doesn't :/
[20:49:12] <versatiletech> hs2: Really bad demo, but a good place to start http://jsbin.com/egopun/3/edit
[20:49:41] <hs2> versatiletech: oh thanks nice!
[21:06:33] <GoGoGarrett> http://pastebin.com/9CYmSLuS    why the heck wont $('#error')   fadeOut..  is it because it was created by jquery?
[21:06:51] <GoGoGarrett> perhaps I should put in some delay somewhere to slow the process down?
[21:12:52] <draginx> animation.me.fadeOut(250).fadeIn(250).animate({left: '-=' + animation.diff}, 500); why would this make an elemtn disapear?
[21:14:01] <jovrtn> what's the value of animation.diff?
[21:14:33] <draginx> uhh
[21:15:09] <draginx> now it doesnt print =/
[21:15:15] <iszak> trololol
[21:15:38] <draginx> 187
[21:16:03] <draginx> weird thing is animations were working fine two weeks ago
[21:17:13] <draginx> jovrtn: the 187 was for u <3
[21:17:34] <jovrtn> o
[21:18:30] <iszak> seems a bit arbitrary doesn't it
[21:19:00] <ITrace> Is there a way I can stop the web page from jumping to an anchor when the user clicks on a link?
[21:19:30] <draginx> ITrace: function(e) { e.preventDefault(); } :)
[21:19:46] <draginx> bind('click', function(e)...
[21:20:27] <bobbobbins> hey, im using hoverIntent on a few different items, and if you hover over one item, then another really quick, it resets the timer, anyone know how to fix that?
[21:21:51] <ITrace> Thanks draginx. Is it possible to do that same thing on page load?
[21:29:21] <ITrace> How can I stop the page from jumping to an anchor if there is a hash in the address bar? I tried this but it didn't work: "...   setTimeout(function() { if (window.location.hash) {   window.scrollTo(0, 0)     ;}}, 1);   ..."
[21:29:58] <iszak> oh god
[21:30:16] <draginx> ITrace: $(function() { if (window.location.hash) { $('body').scrollTop(0); } }); something like that ya?
[21:30:20] <draginx> gotta run sorry i couldnt help more =x
[21:30:26] <ITrace> NP
[21:31:37] <Sample> what's the difference between something like: var tag = 'input'; $('.class '+ tag) and $('.class').find(tag)
[21:31:48] <skylamer`> trace
[21:31:57] <skylamer`> use $(window)
[21:32:36] <LoneStar99>  "<div id="dialog" title="Validation"><p>Validating...</p></div>"  $(document).ready(function() { $("#dialog").dialog(); });  Works but only states "loading"...
[21:33:10] <Cs1800> who invite me to google+???
[21:33:33] <iszak> you mean "who will invite me to Google+?"
[21:34:03] <Cs1800> jeje yep, sorry
[21:34:16] <Cs1800> please :D
[21:34:53] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[21:35:29] <rummik> Should questions regarding the syntax for a plugin I'm writing go to #jquery-dev?
[21:35:40] <LoneStar99> can anyone help me with my dialog problem above...
[21:36:47] <Vorspire> hs2 did you create your drop-down header?
[21:37:03] <hs2> Vorspire: working on it.. got it to slide down
[21:37:12] <hs2> i had to set the .wrapper to position relative
[21:37:13] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/msSGz/ if it helps :)
[21:37:49] <hs2> oh nice!
[21:37:56] <hs2> yeah it will help me in the next stage
[21:38:15] <Vorspire> good luck :D
[21:38:34] <Cs1800> I need an account of "google +" if someone has one I would greatly appreciate if you are willing to give me an invitation. thanks
[21:38:39] <rainerbird> Hi guys, how can I call a function after an each function has completed?
[21:38:50] <hs2> Vorspire: thanks!
[21:39:20] <Vorspire> rainerbird, what do you mean "after"?
[21:40:46] <rainerbird> vorspire: I'm running an each function for an element, and for each element I am calling a function which uses json to get an image. So after I've gone through each element and done the json call, then I want to call another function
[21:41:25] <Vorspire> then just put your next function call after it in the scope?
[21:41:59] <Vorspire> $.each(function(){ /*each code*/ }); $.someOtherFunctionAfter();
[21:43:06] <rainerbird> that's what I have at the moment. But because my each function is adding new elements to the DOM via JSON, the next function still runs too quickly
[21:43:27] <Vorspire> hmm
[21:44:26] <rainerbird> it may be because I'm inserting the whole img via append. If I put the img tag into the source code and just attach the image with "src" then that may work better
[21:44:29] <Vorspire> rainerbird, woould the new deferring methods in jQuery not help with that?
[21:44:35] <Vorspire> ?promise
[21:44:36] <bot-t> Vorspire, .promise() - Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[21:44:56] <rainerbird> I haven't heard of deferring methods, could work though
[21:46:27] <Vorspire> rainerbird, by the login here you just have: .each(function(){ /*each code*/ }).promose().done(function(){ /*code after each*/ });
[21:46:36] <Vorspire> not sure though, never used the new functions myself
[21:46:48] <Vorspire> login /* logic
[21:46:49] <rainerbird> I may give it a shot and let you know
[21:46:55] <Vorspire> ok
[21:47:17] <rummik> So I have this: https://gitorious.org/rummikode/default/blobs/master/misc/selection.js, which allows for  .selection(),  and  .selection('value').  What I'm wondering is if  .selection({start: 10, end: 20})  and  .selection().start/end  is acceptable as well
[21:47:49] <rummik> For textareas and such
[21:48:07] <Vorspire> did you not try it to see?
[21:52:21] <rummik> Vorspire: I wrote it, so I'm wondering if that follows jQuery's patterns or not to do it that way
[21:52:38] <rummik> Assuming that was at me anyway <.<;
[21:53:04] <Vorspire> not really sure tbh, I would typically use a get/set function for each property
[21:53:26] <Vorspire> .function( [val] )
[21:53:37] <rummik> It's modeled a little after .val()
[21:54:18] <rummik> Or .text(), and .html()
[21:54:36] <rummik> Where it's both the getter and setter
[21:55:07] <Vorspire> native JS usually uses non-function property accessors, you /*can*/ do it if you like, it's just not very common in jQuery from what I've seen
[21:57:06] <rummik> Right...but this is with the intent to make selected indexes easier to deal with across browsers, and multiple functions for a getter and setter don't seem to be recommended in jQuery
[21:58:31] <rummik> I'm just curious about allowing both strings and hashes as input for the setter
[22:00:15] <Vorspire> I would have selection.index( [val] ) - but that's my preferred style
[22:00:45] <Vorspire> selection.index( elem, [start, [end]] )
[22:01:40] <rummik> That's actually the internal bits so it doesn't flood the namespace with helpers ^^;
[22:03:03] <Vorspire> I don't understand
[22:04:13] <rummik> selection.getIndex/setIndex are defined within that closure just to help with making .selection()
[22:04:27] <Vorspire> any vars declared inside (function($) { }(jQuery)); are available to that scope only unless otherwise manipulated, so you really don't even need the "selection" object wrapper, are you worried about flooding the global namespace with erronious functions like getIndex/setIndex ?
[22:05:12] <Vorspire> yea I understand now hehe
[22:05:21] <rummik> Just a preference in function access
[22:05:22] <Vorspire> what you've done
[22:05:26] <Vorspire> yeah
[22:08:07] <rummik> But yeah...I'm just wondering if  .selection({start: 0, end: 10}),  and  .selection().start/end  looks okay for this, or if I should be doing something different
[22:12:25] <kendru> I have a question about the .submit() function. How can i make my script execute my code without performing th edefault action (redirecting the browser to the page that handles form input)?
[22:14:00] <rummik> return false; ?
[22:14:16] <djQuery> rummik: I like this one better  .selection({start: 0, end: 10})
[22:14:55] <djQuery> rummik: search for advance jquery plugin and some guy has an article that can do bth.
[22:16:17] <kendru> rummik: i tried return false; and it did not affect the behaviour. i changed the function from .submit() to .click(), and that prevented the browser from redirecting, but it also introduced a couple more problems.
[22:16:31] <rummik> Well, I like being able to set and retrieve string (which is pretty much the most common access methods for this I think), but the actual start- and end-points are pretty useful too
[22:16:32] <djQuery> kendru: $('#myform').submit(function(e){ e.stopPropogation(); e.preventDefault(); /* do error checking */ /* do ajax submit */})
[22:16:56] <djQuery> ?.preventdefault
[22:16:57] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[22:17:15] <djQuery> ?.stoppropogation
[22:17:16] <bot-t> djQuery, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[22:18:58] <kendru> djQuery: thank you. e.stopPropagation() worked like a charm.
[22:22:30] <k1t> i'm having an issue im not sure how to explain.. but whats happening is the jquery code seems to stall sometimes, i have to refresh 1 time on each item of the slideshow to get it to work
[22:22:55] <k1t> http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=cereal
[22:23:06] <k1t> so it gets stuck on loading
[22:23:08] <k1t> but refresh
[22:23:09] <k1t> bam works
[22:23:21] <k1t> not too keen on jquery, may be something obvious in there..
[22:28:48] <k1t> i have to refresh for it to work basically =\
[22:30:55] <djQuery> k1t: works fine in chrome
[22:31:16] <k1t> djQuery: first try?
[22:31:37] <versatiletech> k1t:  what browser are you seeing this issue one?
[22:31:40] <versatiletech> on*
[22:32:05] <k1t> FF5, my friend said same issue on chrome though
[22:32:10] <k1t> maybe cache
[22:32:16] <k1t> on both ends, he's been looking at it too
[22:32:34] <k1t> how about
[22:32:54] <k1t> http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=food-ingredients
[22:33:12] <k1t> http://caspak.agamicreative.net/products/block-bottom/?category=snack-foods
[22:33:22] <k1t> even when i clear cache i'm getting it
[22:35:15] <k1t> i feel like im using the ajax method wrong
[22:36:23] <djQuery> k1t: try console.log some of those vars.
[22:36:51] <k1t> djQuery: kk, got it
[22:37:06] <k1t> in firebug yeah?
[22:37:40] <k1t> er sorry if im on the wrong page with that haha not sure what you mean console.log but it sounds debuggy and helpful
[22:37:59] <djQuery> also var manualPlay = ($.url.param('category') !='');    easier than your if statement there
[22:38:32] <Nuck> ugh
[22:38:49] <k1t> ah, much nicer
[22:39:11] <Nuck> http://peterlejeck.tk:8888/fakooda/site/pushdowns-1.html Can somebody tell me why pd.hasClass on lines 21 and 36 are returning false despite being true?
[22:39:16] <djQuery> k1t: see ?ftjq
[22:39:17] <bot-t> k1t, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[22:40:33] <k1t> djQuery: sweet, going to check that out right now. Thanks
[22:40:36] <k1t> :)
[22:41:07] <k1t> wtf
[22:41:14] <k1t> why is he telling me alert isnt a debugger
[22:41:32] <k1t> jk lol that is hilarious though.. first thing mentioned =x
[22:41:33] <Nuck> k1t: Because it isn't?
[22:41:48] <k1t> Nuck: oh it isnt?
[22:42:05] <k1t> Nuck: i'm shocked
[22:43:40] <Nuck> Can somebody help me with my hasClass issue?
[22:45:34] <Nuck> X(
[22:45:43] <Nuck> Damn you, dead chat!
[22:45:47] * Nuck shakes his fist
[22:48:09] <djQuery> Nuck: you do know that remove class can recieve a space seperated list of classes correct?
[22:48:55] <Nuck> djQuery: Oh derp, I tried to do it with an array and it failed.
[22:49:01] <Nuck> But that's not the issue here :P
[22:49:21] <djQuery> Nuck: just noticed it while reading the code is all
[22:49:28] <Nuck> lol
[22:49:32] <Nuck> thanks for that pointer
[22:50:14] <Nuck> Just changed that, thanks.
[22:51:52] <djQuery> Nuck: so what line is the issue on now? andyou still have multiple .addclass().addclass
[22:52:42] <djQuery> ?toggleclass@nuck
[22:52:42] <bot-t> nuck, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[22:54:10] <Nuck> djQuery: This is a bit beyond the level of toggleClass
[22:54:31] <Nuck> since a click on the current tab should close it, while a click on a different tab should switch to it
[22:55:04] <Nuck> And, of course, clicking on a closed tab should open it
[22:55:27] <djQuery> Nuck: I believe tht it can recieve a 2nd bool param as well
[22:55:47] <Nuck> djQuery: Meh, this system works fine.
[22:55:56] <djQuery> anyways sorry but its too late to think straight
[22:56:00] <Nuck> It's just kinda aggravating that hasClass returns wrongly.
[22:56:15] <Nuck> I mean, I even LOG it.
[22:56:21] <k1t> hm wonder if it has to do with the fact im hitting the XML file 5 times to build my array, shouldn't be doing that
[22:56:56] <Nuck> I'm logging the element then I'm logging the hasClass.  The element most definitely has the class, but hasClass return false
[22:58:20] <djQuery> k1t: hmmm wonder why your using server side url parameters but dont appear to be doing any server side processing to set the initial state of the page?
[22:58:36] <djQuery> so that you dont have to do those requests at all
[22:58:40] <Nuck> BTW, error is on lines 15 and 30
[22:58:43] <k1t> djQuery: very specific request from customer
[22:59:03] <k1t> djQuery: this is to tie in some other things in the CMS, idk..
[22:59:14] <k1t> Nuck: checking it out
[22:59:27] <Nuck> k1t: Thanks, I'm really at a loss.
[22:59:45] <Nuck> I've never seen jQuery behave this way, so I would be VERY surprised if it was anything but my own stupidity.
[23:00:23] <k1t> Nuck: ha miscommunication
[23:08:02] <Nuck> djQuery: Do you see the odd behavior?
[23:08:55] <Assimilater> is there something wrong with my slider constructor? It doesn't appear to be creating the slider: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DMe2n/
[23:12:44] <Assimilater> nevermind...
[23:12:59] <Assimilater> $("CliffWalker") versus $("#CliffWalker")....sigh....
[23:13:18] <djQuery> Nuck: yes the first time loaded fine when you supplied the link subsequent clicks required a browser refresh
[23:14:27] <Nuck> djQuery: huh?
[23:14:33] <Nuck> The problem is that it won't go away
[23:14:41] <Nuck> I need it to remove the pd-open class if it's there
[23:14:55] <Nuck> But when I hasClass for it, it doesn't return true, even though it's there.
[23:15:01] <djQuery> Nuck: sorry was confusing the issues. been about 2 days no sleep
[23:15:20] <Nuck> djQuery: Shiiiiiiiit how are you still awake?
[23:25:52] <Nuck> So, can somebody else halp me with my jQuery issue?
[23:30:04] <hariom> Hi I have a typical requirement. My ajax call is able to get the success callback fired but the data send from the server is incomplete and therefore, in the success callback, I want to raise an error callback so that the subsequent callbacks (deferreds) can know that the previous request failed. How to do that?
[23:30:59] <hariom> How to handled incomplete data but with http 200 ok ?
[23:43:43] <djQuery> var badjsonbad =false;     :success(data){  badjsonbad = checkdata(); check the stats of the var in ur deferds?}
[23:44:28] <djQuery> kinda imaptient isnt he
[23:46:57] <Nolok> iszak: why don't you come to ##php ?
[23:47:24] <djQuery> yes come to the dark side
[23:48:37] <iszak> Nolok, because it's full of n00bs
[23:48:56] <Nolok> aah, I see.
[23:49:10] <Nolok> which channels does not have n00bs ?
[23:49:35] <iszak> all channels have noobs, just more so than others.
[23:49:40] <iszak> and ##php you get a lot of the same questions.
[23:50:01] <Nuck> djQuery: YAY! Figured it out!
[23:50:16] <Nuck> I was unsetting the class right before when I cleared all classes :P
[23:51:02] <djQuery> ?cc@nuck
