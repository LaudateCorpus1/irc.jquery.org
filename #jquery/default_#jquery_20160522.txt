[08:19:06] <dijenerate> hi all
[08:19:51] <dijenerate> is there a jquery function for comparing array numeric values to determine if any two values are within +/-X of each other?
[08:20:26] <dijenerate> does anyone know of such or can anyone point me in the direction of a way to do something similar?
[12:28:40] <printForever> is it possible to combine IF statement with .hover?

[12:53:16] <sdubois_> I have an AdvancedPoll in Drupal that submits votes with AJAX. I would like to change the text of the "Vote" button but I don't have access to the module source cod, which means I have to use JS to modify the text. I have it working fine on page load, but when you hit "vote" it makes the AJAX call which redraws the whole form
[12:53:42] <sdubois_> How can I have it soafter this AJAX call is made the button text is changed again
[13:18:58] <D-rex> sdubois_: post a fiddle of what you have
[14:21:22] <Baako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/4d16tgqo/ 01 is missing from the select list
[14:27:20] <D-rex> Baako: var i=0;
[14:28:54] <Baako> D-rex, did that but inspect element on the option value
[14:28:55] <Baako> https://jsfiddle.net/4d16tgqo/2/
[14:29:00] <Baako> 01 is 0 and 12 is 11
[14:36:43] <Baako> D-rex, any idea?
[14:42:27] <D-rex> https://jsfiddle.net/cercos/4d16tgqo/3/
[14:43:22] <D-rex> just +1 the value aswell
[14:43:45] <D-rex> or set i to 1 and get rid of the +1
[14:45:42] <Baako> cant believe i didnt see that
[14:45:45] <Baako> thanks D-rex

[15:02:43] <glitchhound> Hey all, I'm running into a weird problem where var x = jQuery("#"+id) gives me an 'x' where x.length = 1 and x[0] = {}. I'm getting the same result when calling jQuery(htmlString) - though that same htmlString works websites if I open up dev tools and paste it in. Seems to me like something's breaking my dev environment's jQuery but I really don't see what's changed since it last worked
[15:07:50] <glitchhound> Alright hang on the problem I thought I had might be with my dev tools, let me get back to debugging the old school way and see if I can pin down the actual error.
[15:15:35] <glitchhound> Okay so what actually appears to be failing is $.before
[15:18:13] <glitchhound> ... I'm an idiot
[15:19:00] <glitchhound> I suck with synchronous/asynchronous functions. Please ignore me
[16:09:08] <sdubois_> If i assign a var to a selector that has multiple DOM items, will the cause problems
[16:09:30] <sdubois_> ie, var foo = $('a');
[16:35:18] <sdubois_> I'm running the following, which i want to strip out evertyhing after "%" in a few matching divs, and replace it with the next text
[16:35:35] <sdubois_> it works, except it is putting the entire output in each div, rather than the proper text in the corresponding div
[16:35:38] <sdubois_> http://pastebin.com/gziiWyXw
[16:35:43] <sdubois_> whats the right way to do this?
[17:32:42] <YottaByte> how can I perform different http verbs at some url for an ajax call? like get/delete/post/etc
[17:33:25] <YottaByte> oh,  method in $.ajax it seems
[18:06:09] <groundup> At first glance, any reason why this wouldn't set the data-job-id attr to 72?
[18:06:10] <groundup> $(target).find('.edit-leg').data('job-id', job_id);
[18:06:49] <groundup> It's going to take me a while to crop out everything necessary to make this easy to debug in jsfiddle
[18:15:28] <D-rex> groundup: is there a job_id variable set?
[18:17:28] <groundup> yeah, it is 72
[18:18:15] <groundup> console.log($(target).find('.edit-leg'), job_id) shows [button.btn.btn-primary.btn-lg.edit-leg, prevObject: m.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: "#create-job-modal .edit-leg"] 75
[18:18:30] <groundup> (every refresh it is increasing so disregard that it is different)
[18:20:13] <groundup> Hmm... okay. Nevermind. I did a console.log($(target).find('.edit-leg').data('job-id') and it shows 76. So, not sure what's up with that.
[18:25:17] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, I can't figure out how to reset droppable every time i make something selectable/draggable. As demonstrated in the fiddle, if you select some droppable elements, you will not be able to drop them onto droppable elements because they have .ui-selected, however, if I reselect droppable elements they do not reset and even if they have .ui-selected they are still droppable. Any ideas to reset droppable everytime a new selection is

[22:44:22] <printForever> I've set input filed value with jquery (via .val()). However, when the form is submited, the form is not collecting the field that was set with jquery.
[22:44:35] <printForever> am I missing something?
[22:49:15] <printForever> I used attr instead of val, but its the same thing...
[22:55:20] <printForever> HELLO
[22:55:22] <D-rex> printforever gist your code
[22:55:28] <printForever> D-rex
[22:55:44] <printForever> there is huge chunk of the code
[22:55:51] <D-rex> gist
[22:55:56] <printForever> ....
[22:56:01] <printForever> ah maaaan
[22:56:14] <D-rex> https://gist.github.com/
[22:56:42] <printForever> can you at least help me understand...
[22:56:46] <printForever> without pasting the code
[22:57:11] <D-rex> if I dont see what your doing I cant help you understand what your doing wrong
[22:57:22] <printForever> on CLICK I'm collecting text from h1 and putting it in the input VALUE via .attr()
[22:57:28] <printForever> and it works
[22:57:32] <printForever> php script, works
[22:57:34] <printForever> but...
[22:58:03] <printForever> when submiting the form, the input VALUE that has been set is missing from the email
[22:58:15] <printForever> (form is an email form)
[22:58:19] <D-rex> are you submitting the form after you modify the value
[22:58:25] <printForever> yes
[22:59:14] <printForever> and I've checked four times if the value is in the input field by checking it with jQuery and looking at the browser DOM object
[22:59:33] <D-rex> then without seeing what your doing i cant really help
