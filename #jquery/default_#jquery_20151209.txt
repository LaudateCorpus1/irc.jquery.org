[01:57:01] <Cork> Vivekananda: your searching for a span that is a direct child of #sparks
[01:57:34] <Cork> span can't be a child of #sparks as it is an ul and those can only have li as children

[02:27:30] <hellyeah> yo
[02:27:35] <hellyeah> need ltittle bit help
[02:28:33] <hellyeah> when you drag and drop button onto another button both button are shown in annother div but there is space between them. I know why it happens like that. But dont know the solution. Any tips? http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/20/
[02:45:12] <arup_r> I have this http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EPaqwo?editors=001 now when I am doing   $('.filter-by-author').trigger('change')  it is trigeering twice. Why so ?
[02:49:07] <arc_> not enough information
[02:49:13] <arc_> when are you triggering
[02:50:19] <lite_> How do I append/replace the content of bed-place container here? http://pastebin.com/gu819cFR
[02:50:28] <lite_> with a new dom element
[02:50:56] <arc_> append and replace the content are different
[02:51:19] <coderhut> Hi experts, how can I avoid user to paste "</script><script>alert('XSS');</script>" this into input box?
[02:51:33] <arc_> to replace the content, use html()
[02:51:38] <lite_> arc_: Okay. So how do I append to bed-place container in my example ?
[02:54:00] <arc_> well, i should say to insert content into that div, assuming you do not include that placeholder text
[02:54:21] <arc_> arup_r are you still there
[02:54:28] <arup_r> yes
[02:54:34] <arc_> so when are you triggering
[02:55:10] <arup_r> I have another date field, when there is any datachange, I am manually trigerring this field..
[02:56:14] <arc_> can you include all of this code
[02:56:34] <arup_r> ok with HTML ?
[02:56:46] <arup_r> I am now 2 hours on it.. not able to fix.
[02:56:53] <arc_> for now without html is fine. we'll see
[02:56:54] <hellyeah> when you drag and drop button onto another button both button are shown in annother div but there is space between them. I know why it happens like that. But dont know the solution. Any tips? http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/20/
[02:59:41] <hellyeah> pls some help fellas
[03:00:01] <hellyeah> my question iws not clear
[03:01:05] <arup_r> arc_: included all JS http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EPaqwo?editors=001
[03:02:36] <arc_> yeah ... that's not what i meant but i'll try to figure this out
[03:02:52] <arup_r> I am trigerring from line# 21 arc_
[03:03:21] <arup_r> line# 103 is the actual code
[03:03:45] <arc_> why are you returning it
[03:03:53] <arc_> i honestly don't even know what that would do
[03:04:17] <arc_> i guess return true if successful
[03:04:52] <arc_> it doesn't seem like you want to do that though
[03:04:58] <arup_r> arc_: ok. I have some <li> which contains video clips. I want to filter then by author/date ( this works) .. I also want to search them by auhro and date both, which sucks..
[03:05:28] <arup_r> I am not able to manage the last part "both"
[03:05:49] <arup_r> should I give you the link of the page, where it is running
[03:05:52] <arc_> i meant why are you doing return on line 21 instead of simply running that line normally
[03:06:00] <arup_r> may be some hints on the problem how to solve
[03:07:11] <arup_r> it is a compiled JS from Coffescript.. I didn't return manually anything...
[03:07:31] <arup_r> The code I gave you is from Browser source tab
[03:07:49] <arc_> ok, well sorry but i can't figure this out right now. hopefully someone else can help
[03:08:03] <arup_r> yes, it is so ugly.. haha
[03:08:59] <hellyeah> do you know jquery ui?
[03:09:52] <hassoon> hellyeah: i know jquery, but what is jquery 'ui'
[03:11:03] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/
[03:11:06] <arc_> a framework that has precreated ui elements
[03:11:39] <hellyeah> arc_: do you know about it
[03:12:25] <arc_> no
[03:12:32] <hellyeah> #jqueryah okey
[03:12:40] <arc_> i wasn't able to drag a button onto another button at all. they would only move vertically
[03:13:11] <hellyeah> okey move vertically and drop it when you are onto another button
[03:13:36] <arc_> but ... the buttons are to the left and right
[03:14:53] <coderhut>  Hi experts, how can I avoid user to paste "</script><script>alert('XSS');</script>" this into input box and avoid get it executed?
[03:15:28] <arc_> i don't know the answer to your question, but the concept you need to research is input sanitization
[03:16:23] <hellyeah> coderhut: afaik in order to avoid XSS
[03:16:30] <hellyeah> you need to do validation
[03:16:44] <Cork> coderhut: it depends on how you generate the input fields
[03:16:45] <hellyeah> server side validation and as an option client side validation
[03:17:10] <hellyeah> Cork knows the best :)
[03:17:21] <Cork> coderhut: if it is a generated html page, then input value is normally filtered server side
[03:17:23] <coderhut> I am doing server side validation, but client asks if a user pastes  <script>alert('XSS');</script> then alert should not be displayed
[03:17:42] <Cork> coderhut: if you so it through javascript you can get around it by just not generating html
[03:17:56] <Cork> coderhut: also you can set csp on the site preventing inline scripting
[03:18:09] <Cork> coderhut: but note that will make it impossible for you too
[03:18:30] <Cork> and things like <button onclick="anything"> won't work
[03:18:48] <Cork> (a good thing if you ask me :) )
[03:19:49] <coderhut> Cork & Hellyeay: thank you for the detailed answers. I think I have seen clients code and it is executing alert because of onkeyup function. So before alerting, i will remove script
[03:21:37] <lite_> arc_: so how do I insert stuff into a jquery object
[03:22:09] <hellyeah> i am not sure it is relevant but may be you can limit user about what they type in input box. So you can use regular expression. HTML% has something for it. It can help may be not typing random thing to input box
[03:22:57] <hellyeah> lite_: HTML5
[03:22:59] <hellyeah> ops
[03:23:05] <hellyeah> coderhut: html5
[03:23:06] <arc_> lite_ depends on what it is. afaik there is no way to create a new dom element of a type without just using html() and a string
[03:23:32] <Cork> there are plenty of ways
[03:23:45] <arc_> like what
[03:23:56] <Cork> $('<span>') for example
[03:24:05] <hellyeah> brb
[03:24:09] <Cork> that is the same thing as $(document.createElement('span'))
[03:24:13] <arc_> okay, he's trying to insert it into an existing element
[03:24:19] <Cork> ya?
[03:24:23] <Cork> just use .append
[03:24:37] <Cork> it takes, jquery objects, dom elements, and html
[03:24:47] <lite_> ill try to rephrase myself then: How so i insert content into bed-place container here? http://pastebin.com/gu819cFR . I have a jquery object "newDomelement" and I want to insert that into bed-place container.
[03:24:52] <Cork> or prepend if you want to add it to the top of the element
[03:25:09] <arc_> hm, i thought append just took strings. ok
[03:25:21] <lite_> Cork:  the problem is that I want to append it to an inner node in the dialog object
[03:25:25] <Cork> lite_: $('.bed-place.container').append(newDomelement)
[03:25:53] <lite_> Cork:  will that selector work if the bed-place.container isnt in the dom ?
[03:25:54] <Cork> ah missed the $('') there
[03:26:01] <Cork> lite_: dialog.find('.bed-place.container').append(newDomelement)
[03:26:09] <lite_> there we go
[03:26:13] <lite_> perfect!
[03:26:14] <lite_> thanks
[03:26:16] <Cork> np
[03:27:25] <Cork> arc_: there is very few places that only accepts strings in jquery
[03:27:32] <arc_> i see
[03:27:37] <Cork> wrap/wrapAll is the only one i can think of right now
[04:10:57] <hellyeah> hey sup
[04:11:04] <hellyeah> anyone know jquery ui here?
[05:01:15] <ismithers> Hi all, at what stage does the $(function() {}); function get run? Is it document ready?
[05:01:52] <fr4nk> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[05:02:36] <ismithers> Thanks
[05:02:41] <ismithers> That is what I thought.
[05:05:13] <ismithers> Where can I find information on general webpage event order? Like window load vs document ready and so forth?
[05:13:33] <sigdk> hi. I copy the code from this demo: https://jqueryui.com/tabs/ but I cannot get the tab-ed behavior. What I see is a list of links and below them the text (no tabs). Shouldn't it work as is ?
[05:14:29] <Xatenev> sigdk: any console errors?
[05:15:07] <Xatenev> sigdk: it actually works as is - juts copied it over to jsfiddle
[05:15:25] <sigdk> Xatenev, hmm.... good question. Probably the links to the libs are dead
[05:15:38] <Xatenev> sigdk: no it works great. :p
[05:15:59] <sigdk> Xatenev, send me the url please
[05:16:04] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/
[05:16:09] <Xatenev> @ sigdk
[05:16:45] <Cork> sigdk: did you include the css files?
[05:17:02] <Xatenev> Cork: the css files are included with the example
[05:17:02] <Cork> jquery ui uses both a javascript and css resources
[05:17:11] <sigdk> Cork, actually I completely removed the line with the resources/demos/style.css
[05:17:46] <Cork> sigdk: the line that matters is <link rel="stylesheet" href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">
[05:17:57] <sigdk> that's there...
[05:18:00] <Cork> ok
[05:18:04] <Xatenev> sigdk: can we see that somewhere?
[05:18:27] <Xatenev> sigdk: check the developer tools in the 'network' tab
[05:18:38] <Xatenev> and see if those files are included correctly (200) or are missing (404)
[05:18:47] <sigdk> for me it says: GET file://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
[05:18:54] <Xatenev> yea there we go lol
[05:18:54] <Cork> ah
[05:18:58] <sigdk> so as I said before, I thought the links are dead
[05:19:03] <Cork> sigdk: your running from local file
[05:19:03] <Xatenev> its not file://
[05:19:11] <Cork> so you need to change //code... to http://
[05:19:15] <Cork> (or https://)
[05:19:23] <Xatenev> run it from a webserver and // will resolve to https// or http automatically.
[05:19:42] <Cork> // means use the same protocol as the current page
[05:19:56] <Cork> and in your case that's file:
[05:20:29] <Cork> (though you should set up a local webserver for testing, file: has a lot of weird special cases making it a bad test bed)
[05:20:52] <Xatenev> btw developer tools are always great to check for errors :)^^
[05:20:59] <Cork> ya
[05:21:11] <sigdk> thanks, it works fine
[05:21:52] <Cork> sigdk: there are complete lamp bundles you can grab to easily set up a test environemtn
[05:21:55] <sigdk> how come did it run properly at jsfiddle ?
[05:22:00] <Cork> i really recommend doing so
[05:22:05] <Xatenev> sigdk: because jsfiddle runs on http (on a webserver)
[05:22:10] <Xatenev> sigdk: so // resolves automatically to http
[05:22:12] <Cork> *https
[05:22:14] <Xatenev> and so the link iwll become correct
[05:22:40] <Xatenev> Cork: if you run HTTPS everywhere addon yea
[05:22:50] <Xatenev> Cork: but it doesnt redirect automatically for me, i keep using the http variant lol^^
[05:22:55] <Cork> Xatenev: no, jsfiddle uses https by default now days
[05:23:36] <Xatenev> Cork: not for me tho, can this be any kind of browser cache?
[05:23:50] <Cork> not sure
[05:24:09] <Cork> i have to manually change https to http in the url when i create a jsfiddle if i don't want https
[05:24:14] <Cork> (and no i don't have https everywhere)
[05:24:19] <Xatenev> other way around for me
[05:24:26] <Xatenev> no matter what im on http if i dont explicility write https
[05:24:49] <sigdk> Cork, what lamp bundles ? Is there any "environment" to download with a template html and a set of js libs ?
[05:24:51] <Xatenev> w/e^^
[05:25:02] <Cork> sigdk: yes
[05:25:06] <Cork> sigdk: what os are you on?
[05:25:10] <sigdk> linux
[05:25:15] <Cork> oh
[05:25:24] <Cork> heh, well then you don't need a lamp bundle :)
[05:25:34] <Cork> just install apache or nginx from your distros repo
[05:25:39] <Cork> one command away ^^
[05:26:41] <sigdk> Cork, this is a webserver... how would that help ?
[05:26:41] <Cork> apt-get install nginx => debian based
[05:26:42] <Xatenev> if you just test around with JS HTML and CSS for school tasks or something like that you can easily use jsfiddle all the way though
[05:26:48] <sigdk> I do run a tomcat somewhere
[05:26:54] <Cork> dnf install nginx => fedora based
[05:27:02] <Cork> pacman -S ngenx => arch
[05:27:04] <Cork> and so on :)
[05:27:19] <Xatenev> lol pacman
[05:27:22] <Cork> sigdk: it would mean you could point the browser to http://127.0.0.1
[05:27:49] <Cork> and you would have a normal path structure and everything you would have on a normal site
[05:28:00] <Cork> sigdk: this is something you don't have if you run on file:
[05:28:19] <Cork> Xatenev: the package manager to rule them all :)
[05:29:12] <sigdk> I can't I have it locally ? I need a proper path structure either I run it locally or on a webserver
[05:29:34] <Cork> sigdk: uh, 127.0.0.1 IS locally
[05:29:44] <Cork> 127.0.0.1 is explicitly localhost
[05:29:48] <sigdk> sorry, I meant out of the webserver context
[05:29:50] <Cork> it can't get routed outside your computer
[05:30:13] <Cork> sigdk: well you can run from file, but don't expect it to behave like it would on a website
[05:30:15] <Cork> cause it won't
[05:30:29] <Cork> especially path resources will differ a lot
[05:30:35] <Cork> and lot of web features won't work
[05:32:50] <Cork> sigdk: also if you ever want to use generated html you need a server side scripting language
[05:32:57] <Cork> and then you have to use a web server
[05:35:47] <sigdk> Cork, I see...
[06:29:01] <fattest> why is my code block still executing after returning false?? http://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/
[06:33:45] <fr4nk> because you return 2 Elements ("false") of a new array in map
[06:33:59] <fr4nk> return have to be outside the callback of map
[06:34:17] <fr4nk> if the code shouldnt exec further
[06:34:55] <fr4nk> the return in map returns new elements for a new array (in this case boolean false values)
[06:35:01] <fr4nk> http://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/1/
[06:35:57] <fr4nk> so you missunderstood array.map()
[06:36:02] <fr4nk> https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[06:36:06] <fattest> i see now
[06:36:08] <fattest> thank you
[06:36:14] <fattest> i used a traditional loop this time http://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/2/
[06:43:57] <Cork> fattest: don't use for in on an array
[06:44:05] <Cork> it is dangerous
[06:44:28] <fattest> what do i use instead?
[06:44:55] <fattest> Cork .each() ?
[06:44:59] <Cork> ya
[06:45:18] <Cork> or for var i = 0; i < fields.length;i++)
[06:45:21] <fr4nk> for(var i = i; i<a.length; ++i)
[06:45:30] <fr4nk> XD
[06:45:31] <Cork> but ya, .each is a nicer solution
[06:45:43] <Cork> fields.forEach is another option
[06:45:51] <Cork> fattest: what are you trying to do?
[06:46:40] <Cork> cause you could prob write that in a cleaner solution
[06:46:40] <fattest> Cork I want to check, for each element in an array, to pass a regex expression. If I find one that evaluates to false, I break out of the loop
[06:47:15] <Cork> ok, so you just want to know if it exists, you don't want the one/ones that exist?
[06:47:35] <fattest> that is correct
[06:48:28] <fattest> Cork I have if (!/^[a-zA-Z]*$/.test(fields[item])){
[06:48:47] <Cork> fattest: https://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/3/ then
[06:49:01] <Cork> opps missed the return >_<
[06:49:38] <Cork> fattest: https://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/4/
[06:50:10] <hellyeah> hey
[06:50:19] <fattest> Cork you're using a for loop on an array
[06:50:28] <fattest> you told me that is dangerous to use
[06:50:33] <Cork> fattest: for is fine
[06:50:36] <Cork> for in is not
[06:50:45] <fattest> oh
[06:51:03] <hellyeah> when youdrag and drop button onto another button. There is a grap between these buttons. I try something to handle situtation but i cannt find how to do that. Do you have any tips about that? Hope my question is clear http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/23/
[06:51:03] <Cork> fattest: for in loops the property keys of the object
[06:51:21] <Cork> fattest: so Array.prototype.my_function = function() {} will be included
[06:51:44] <fattest> Cork what does this line do Array.prototype[0] = 111; ?
[06:52:03] <Cork> lol code i left around for the example i was about to make >_<
[06:52:05] <Cork> just remove it
[06:53:02] <fattest> thank you so much
[06:53:16] <Cork> fattest: this is another solution https://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/5/
[06:54:01] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/p8ervocu/6/ <-- with that stupid prototype line removed
[06:54:57] <fattest> Cork lol you did it in one line :) efficient
[06:55:00] <fattest> excellent thanks
[06:55:12] <Cork> fattest: well it isn't more efficient then the for loop
[06:55:23] <Cork> but it is easier to read code (not by much though)
[06:55:32] <Cork> that solution creates a new array with all the matches
[06:55:38] <Cork> so it is less efficient
[06:56:06] <hellyeah> is fp writing style?
[07:20:20] <Guest15809> hello
[07:20:29] <hxm> f
[07:20:55] <hxm> hello, i have a code that works in chrome but not in firefox, how can i show you the problem
[07:21:05] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[07:27:24] <hxm> http://jsfiddle.net/wpghxrwt/ using chrome: each link of the navbar is loaded with ajax, in firefox it goes directly instead
[07:27:27] <hxm> no errors on firefox
[07:28:43] <Cork> hxm: your using window.event instead of the first argument to the callback
[07:28:49] <Cork> that is a none standard old ie property
[07:28:54] <Cork> and firefox doesn't provide it
[07:29:03] <Cork> so just change function() { to function(event) {
[07:29:07] <Cork> and everything should work
[07:31:57] <hxm> oh, you are right, thank you so much
[07:58:59] <dan2k3k4> I have a select box with some options like:
[07:59:42] <dan2k3k4> <select name="some_name[code]" id="myId"> <option value="food">Food stuff</option><option value="hotel">Hotel stuff</option> </select>
[08:00:34] <uttpal> Hi!
[08:01:30] <dan2k3k4> so how do I set the option with jQuery
[08:01:46] <Cork> set option?
[08:01:47] <uttpal> I want to make contributions to this community. i have sound knoledge of javascript.
[08:01:48] <dan2k3k4> as $('#myId').val('food') doesn't seem to change from selected hotel to food -_-
[08:01:52] <Cork> or change what is selected?
[08:01:57] <dan2k3k4> Cork change what is selected
[08:02:09] <Cork> .val shoudl work just fine
[08:02:18] <uttpal> can anyone help me get started!
[08:02:20] <dan2k3k4> seems I would have to remove prop selected from all options, then set prop selected (or attr)
[08:02:54] <dan2k3k4> Cork doing .val should work using Chrome Dev tools right ?
[08:02:59] <dan2k3k4> doesn't seem to update :/
[08:03:21] <Cork> dan2k3k4: https://jsfiddle.net/eLrqjqn1/
[08:03:48] <Cork> uttpal: https://contribute.jquery.org/
[08:08:08] <dan2k3k4> Cork but then how to change that in the Chrome dev tools ?
[08:08:13] <dan2k3k4> $('#myId') is null
[08:08:26] <Cork> dan2k3k4: try jQuery('#myId')
[08:08:32] <Cork> $ might not be jquery
[08:08:47] <dan2k3k4> jQuery not defined o_0
[08:09:03] <Cork> uh
[08:09:14] <Cork> then you don't have jquery loaded normally on the page
[08:12:48] <hellyeah> hey
[08:17:38] <dan2k3k4> Cork it's because the fiddle uses an iframe for the output :o
[08:17:51] <Cork> ah, you tried to do it in jsfiddle
[08:17:54] <dan2k3k4> yeah
[08:18:12] <dan2k3k4> wanted to test that it works :s as unsure why it's not working on my page
[08:19:13] <dan2k3k4> could be older jq?
[08:20:42] <dan2k3k4> jQuery v1.10.2
[08:20:43] <dan2k3k4> :/
[08:20:56] <Cork> no
[08:21:06] <Cork> this has worked for ages
[08:21:21] <Cork> i remember using it in 1.0 :)
[08:24:11] <dan2k3k4> ah Cork - it seems that the select box is tweaked and uses this kind of html:
[08:24:34] <dan2k3k4> https://jsbin.com/wahenowasu/edit?html,output
[08:24:36] <dan2k3k4> ;/
[08:24:36] <Cork> ya, replacing select elements is always a bad idea
[08:24:54] <Cork> and don't use jsbin
[08:24:56] <dan2k3k4> display shows whats in <label>
[08:24:56] <Cork> the site sucks
[08:25:01] <dan2k3k4> kk
[08:25:07] <Cork> all you had there was an empty page
[08:25:42] <hellyeah> what about codepen
[08:25:58] <Cork> codepen is ok, but jsfiddle is by far the best
[08:26:12] <hellyeah> hum m okey
[08:26:15] <dan2k3k4> Cork so you don't see the html code on the side ?
[08:26:29] <hellyeah> you dont need head body in jsfiddle
[08:26:51] <dan2k3k4> anyway, it's <select><option> elems</select> then <label> SELECTED_OPTION </label> - guessing some other code [maybe angular] is changing/updating the label
[08:27:58] <Cork> dan2k3k4: if this was what you wanted to show, sure https://i.imgur.com/eBOMYhM.png
[08:28:16] <dan2k3k4> -_- :/
[08:29:12] <dan2k3k4> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/zgna7gaq/
[08:29:42] * Cork nods
[08:30:05] <Cork> so when you change the selection you have to trigger the plugin to update the replacement
[08:30:27] <Cork> (better option is normally just to style the selectbox)
[08:31:37] <dan2k3k4> in fact it seems it doesn't take into account the selected=true / selected="selected" as that doesn't update when you manually change - only <label> after updates o_0 [but somehow clicked the select still shows the right selected item
[08:31:48] <dan2k3k4> new job - codebase is :X
[08:32:29] <Cork> dan2k3k4: you could try .trigger('change') on the select element
[08:35:51] <dan2k3k4> Cork trigger seems to do it - thanks ! (although selected="selected" doesn't update to the other option boxes, nor does doing it manually weird)
[08:36:15] <Cork> dan2k3k4: selected="selected" is the attribute on the option
[08:36:21] <Cork> not the state of the select element
[09:08:31] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know if babelify requires additional presets when running the browserify command?
[09:08:37] <jeffreylevesque> i mean more than `browserify /vagrant/src/jsx/"$file" -t [ babelify --presets es2015,react ] -o /vagrant/src/js/"$filename".js`
[09:08:41] <jeffreylevesque> i'm getting things like https://bpaste.net/show/e4436329ecb3
[09:08:53] <jeffreylevesque> each time I install the module it complains about, another module is required
[09:33:58] <nru> does anyknow here know where i get a plugin which can let me put products on a page and a cart and then send contents as json
[09:41:40] <seemikehack> Hey all. When I drop a tool from the palette on the canvas, it shifts up and to the left to the amount of the palette's margin (5px). How do I counteract this? http://codepen.io/seemikehack/pen/MKYqaj
[09:41:57] <Xatenev> nru: http://www.jqueryrain.com/demo/jquery-shopping-cart/
[10:04:52] <krambiorix> hi, i'm starting a new project, should i create a plugin or just a bunch of functions?
[10:10:04] <hellyeah> anyone know about jquery ui?
[10:14:38] <hellyeah> when i drop button another one i can create div and put those button. now i need to put third button on that div. I guess i need to use sortable future for that. Can you help me to figure out that http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/32/ thanks
[10:52:14] <Vivekananda> hi jquery. anyone around :)
[10:55:20] <xec> Vivekananda: 652 people in channel, i'm sure they aren't all afk. just ask ;)
[10:56:00] <Vivekananda> hahah okay.
[10:56:17] <Vivekananda> first question how do I use hexchat to count the channel population ?
[10:56:35] <printForever> is it possible to enable diacritics in Select2?
[10:59:23] <Xatenev> Vivekananda: how is this a jquery question
[10:59:30] <printForever> does anyone know what diacritics is?
[10:59:41] <NoiseEee> isnt that just another word for scientology
[10:59:45] <NoiseEee> oh wait thats dianetics
[10:59:50] <Xatenev> NoiseEee: almost doe
[11:00:37] <printForever> NoiseEee, and its spelled differently :)
[11:00:42] <Vivekananda> and a more pertinent jquery question. I am trying to alter the values for the first sparkline and reflow it. Note that it is used as a class and not created directly in the html using a .sparkline(). I want to update it with new values. With the code posted in jsfiddle I do get an update but colors and alignments all are way off.  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/f54jdthj/13/  . The results ( with js replaced values  img 2)
[11:00:42] <Vivekananda> and with html hardcoded  values are here in this imgur image -- http://imgur.com/a/OwXAi
[11:01:01] <Vivekananda> Xatenev, it is not but the following one is
[11:02:07] <Vivekananda> for both images the sparkline to consider is the one right next to MyIncome at the top of the page
[11:13:20] <Vivekananda> hmm trying something new but wonder if it will work
[11:14:05] <printForever> is it possible to enable diacritics in Select2?
[11:26:05] <printForever> can anyone help with this? I couldn't find anything on the web or documentation
[11:28:00] <printForever> https://select2.github.io/examples.html#diacritics
[11:28:32] <guest__> hllo, how to resolve the conflict between bootstrap and jQuery
[11:28:34] <guest__> ?
[11:28:46] <printForever> there is no example, it's just a regular select2
[11:29:04] <guest__> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34183247/jquery-and-bootstrap-conflict-dropdown-menu
[11:35:06] <shoky> printForever: it shows you that by default select2 will ignore diacritics, so it works even if you don't put them in. though this seems to only work with diacritics on latin letters, not e.g. hebrew.  what behaviour are you looking for?
[11:35:13] <ExtraSteve> Is there a way to make a div fadeIn/fadeOut without losing the space that it occupies?
[11:35:43] <printForever> shoky, thank you man!
[11:35:44] <shoky> ExtraSteve: animate opacity to 0 or 1
[11:36:04] <printForever> shoky, thanks for picking up the call :) how can I add diacritics to Select2?
[11:36:13] <shoky> printForever: what do you mean?
[11:36:44] <printForever> sec
[11:36:57] <printForever> I want to enable diacritics search in Select2 so that u character would not be the same as u with umlaut (two dots on top of it) or as with any other character ö, ä, ü. Is this possible?
[11:37:24] <shoky> ah so you want it NOT to ignore diacritics
[11:37:30] <printForever> CORRECT
[11:41:35] <Vivekananda> hey everyone hoping someone looked at my question. trying to give new values to a hardcoded sparkline in an html. Can anyone tell me how to do it properly keeping the colors and alignement. here is a jsfiddle and the current code I am trying to use. http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/f54jdthj/15/
[11:41:53] <printForever> shoky, I made a fiddle, but it didn't help
[11:42:01] <ellistaa> what do i have to do to be able to manipulate newly added elements via ajax?
[11:42:33] <printForever> ellistaa, I recently used AjaxComplete to check if the element is there
[11:43:46] <ellistaa> printForever: thanks but i’m not needing to check if it’s there, i need to be able to manipulate it after i append it to the page
[11:44:14] <shoky> printForever: looking at select2's source code.. it doesn't seem that it gives you a way to disable that. you'd have to change the select2 code :\
[11:44:41] <shoky> pretty dumb not to make that optional
[11:45:55] <Vivekananda> when I try the second one I just get all numbers but no graph :(
[11:46:36] <Vivekananda> http://imgur.com/3KbVLj6
[11:46:42] <printForever> shoky, oh crap :(
[11:47:11] <shoky> printForever: anyways if you want to go that way.. i can tell you waht to change :S
[11:47:25] <ellistaa> how do i get access to newly appended ajax elements?
[11:47:40] <printForever> shoky, please do
[11:50:28] <shoky> printForever:  there's 2 lines with a call to "stripDiacritics" function:  var original = stripDiacritics(data.text).toUpperCase();    var term = stripDiacritics(params.term).toUpperCase();
[11:51:05] <hassoon> ellistaa: $.ajax({});
[11:51:06] <shoky> printForever:  remove those 2 calls, i.e. change those 2 lines to:   var original = data.text.toUpperCase();   var term = params.term.toUpperCase();
[11:51:30] <printForever> can I remove them in the external JS file, without editing the select2.full.js file?
[11:51:44] <hassoon> ellistaa: https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/jquery-ajax-methods/
[11:51:47] <shoky> printForever: no
[11:52:12] <printForever> ok...
[11:52:23] <shoky> printForever: well i thought you meant if you can remove them in your own js file ?
[11:52:32] <shoky> or did you mean something else by external js
[11:53:50] <printForever> shoky, I thought, since I include select2.full.js, I thought I can "cancel" those var's from my own js file 'main.js' that is included after select2.full.js. Now I understand that is not possible, because its executed after it?
[11:54:27] <shoky> yea, not possible in this case,  because they are private functions that you don't have access to from outside
[11:54:48] <printForever> ok, I will try to do that now and report back
[11:54:55] <shoky> goodluck
[11:55:05] <printForever> thanks...
[11:57:01] <Vivekananda> anyone for my question ?
[12:26:58] <tb_b_> Hi, i would like to change the title of the current Window, that won't be a Problem, but i need that the title i have changed will also appear in the Chrome-Browser History, that won't work, at Safari and Firefox it does work, any idea?
[12:55:34] <lyhr> I am hiding a section of a page but a link on the page --> onclick="bubbles.getBubblesTab().refresh('ListViews', {"type":"people","filter":"recent"});" refreshes data and that refresh loads back the section i previously hid via $("#this_widget").hide(); since the entire page is not reloading the section is not hiding again. how can i fire that hide function after the refresh?
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick fwiw.  and there should be a callback available that you can use.
[12:56:52] <lyhr> robertmaxrees the code is not mine i am modifying a site i dont have access to that code to change it from an onclick
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense, but okay.
[12:57:16] <robertmaxrees> then you can't really change anything else.
[12:58:05] <lyhr> i am modifying the ui of a site community that i can add a header and footer to and that is where I am placing my code
[12:58:28] <robertmaxrees> if you can't change the onclick, then you're probably not going to be able to fix your issue.
[12:58:48] <robertmaxrees> unless that bubbles thing uses jquery's ajax under the hood.
[12:59:29] <km4> hi
[12:59:53] <taplar> hola
[12:59:58] <lyhr> ok i will look into that thanks robertmaxrees
[12:59:58] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[13:00:02] <Vivekananda> hey everyone.
[13:02:01] <Vivekananda> I am trying to update hardcoded sparklines with new values. When I give the values instead of bars/ the values themselves show up. Here is the original html(hardcoded) and my attempts. http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/f54jdthj/15/  . Any pointers would be great
[13:02:22] <taplar> Vivekananda: i was trying to look at that earlier but your fiddle is broken
[13:02:23] <robertmaxrees> what is "sparkline"?
[13:02:30] <robertmaxrees> and you're not loading jquery.
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're trying to use the external resources - click the cog icon next to the "javascript" title and load it from that menu Vivekananda
[13:03:07] <Vivekananda> taplar, yes. that fiddle doesn't work coz the classes aren't present there :). I was just trying to show my attempts.
[13:03:22] <taplar> i was referring to what robert said, about the libaries not being included
[13:04:09] <robertmaxrees> and you should read the docs for sparkline if you want to figure out how to update a graph.
[13:05:47] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I went through them. but
[13:05:57] <Vivekananda> nevermind I will try some more
[13:07:31] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda tell you what - if I figure it out from the first page of the docs, what will you give me? ;)
[13:08:56] <taplar> here's the plugins added http://jsfiddle.net/f54jdthj/18/
[13:10:09] <taplar> but just going off the comment in the logic, it doesn't look like your targeting "MyIncome" at all to change it
[13:10:23] <robertmaxrees> they're trying to just write in the new HTML.
[13:10:29] <robertmaxrees> instead of initializing with new data.
[13:10:45] <taplar> i guess.  not sure how that relates to the external MyIncome
[13:10:51] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, it is not an issue with the docs. I was able to change values and show up the new sparklines. I used jquery code in the first part. The problem is it doesn't get the layout that the div has in the html. Let me show you what happens -- http://imgur.com/a/OwXAi  . the first image is with jquery and second is hardcoded. So somehow I have to repaint the whole div in the html with the new values. I tried
[13:10:51] <Vivekananda> a.replace but then the bars don't show
[13:10:58] <Vivekananda> wonder if you are getting me
[13:11:12] <robertmaxrees> that screenshot is terribly unhelpful.
[13:11:17] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're referring to.
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[13:11:29] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, just look at the bar for My income
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[13:11:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:11:35] <Vivekananda> only that is changed
[13:14:45] <HaDAk> has anyone worked with the blueimp image gallery before? i'm having a tough time getting it to *not* set <body> to overflow: none;
[13:14:49] <Vivekananda> taplar, I didn't get you. I am currently just trying to paint a new sparkline but using <div class="sparkline"><> rather than $(div).sparkline(). If I can do that then I can append it anywhere. Right now the latter method works but I don't get correct layout. The former method doesn't give me any bars just the numerical values themselves as here -- http://imgur.com/3KbVLj6
[13:15:29] <taplar> the fiddle i posted last has the bars...
[13:15:36] <Vivekananda> one sec
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda right - you need to then re-run the sparkline method after you append the div.
[13:15:59] <Vivekananda> oo ok that is what I was thinking
[13:16:08] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't automatically run for you.
[13:16:14] <Vivekananda> so how do I do that :). yeaeh that is what
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> the same way you initialize it elsewhere.
[13:17:04] <Vivekananda> ok so I should look again at documents then ok thanks robertmaxrees (although that was apparent yet I thought it was some sparkline magic or something)
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> ... you are already using that method call.
[13:17:57] <Vivekananda> wonder if it will be part of a css or js. I am ? you mean the pagefunction()
[13:18:05] <Vivekananda> hmm
[13:18:07] <robertmaxrees> $('.sparkline').sparkline([1300, 1877, 2500, 2577, 2000, 2100, 3000, 2700, 3631, 2471, 2700, 3631, 2471], {type: 'bar'});
[13:18:15] <robertmaxrees> you have to re-run this code for your new html.
[13:19:38] <taplar> i have a feeling doing that it's ignoring the sparkline innerHTML though
[13:19:55] <km4> what IDE you use at work guys ?
[13:20:00] <taplar> intellij
[13:20:18] <robertmaxrees> intellij if i need an IDE.  usually in sublime though.
[13:20:51] <NoiseEee> intellij as well / phpstorm
[13:21:27] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I am not sure if .sparkline method gives me these 'class' attribute values --  <div class="sparkline txt-color-blue hidden-mobile hidden-md hidden-sm">
[13:21:55] <km4> wow ;P I now testing atom
[13:22:13] <taplar> Vivekananda: i'm not sure that it changes your sparkline object.  it's just replacing the content
[13:22:19] <taplar> inspect the chart and look at the html
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> it takes care of that for you.
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f54jdthj/20/
[13:22:35] <Vivekananda> taplar, yeah that is what . taplar if you look at the imgur image 1 above that I posed ( with two pics) and compare the bars next to my income then you see that the colors are different
[13:22:47] <robertmaxrees> because you need to inisialize them the same.
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> *initialize
[13:22:54] <Vivekananda> hmm lemme check
[13:25:13] <taplar> looks like you can also tell it to use the html rather than giving it an array from the docs
[13:25:18] <taplar> and an optional color
[13:27:18] <Vivekananda> taplar, how ?
[13:27:25] <taplar> look at the docs
[13:27:38] <taplar> they are your friend, :)
[13:28:28] <Vivekananda> you mean sparkline docs right ?
[13:28:32] <taplar> yup
[13:28:41] <robertmaxrees> what other docs would he be referring to?
[13:29:59] <printForever> hi good people
[13:30:02] <printForever> shoky, it worked!
[13:30:18] <printForever> shoky, resident Select2 expert
[13:30:25] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, your comment above -- $('.sparkline').sparkline([1300, 1877, 2500, 2577, 2000, 2100, 3000, 2700, 3631, 2471, 2700, 3631, 2471], {type: 'bar'}); you have to re-run this code for your new html.  --- I was looking at this. my .append/.rplace does replace the div but if I use your code here to run 'sparklines' it will ignore the color etc that is specified in the div encapsulating it.
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> because you need to re-initialize that as well.
[13:31:10] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I have docs for the dashboard itself that I am working on.
[13:31:11] <robertmaxrees> that's controlled by the code that initializes the chart.
[13:31:28] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda why would we be referring those docs if we're talking about the charting library?
[13:32:49] <taplar> not like we'd even know what docs those dashboard docs would be anyway
[13:32:51] <robertmaxrees> lol either way, you need to actually reinitialize the plugin entirely - it's not going to just happen do work for you.  you gotta pass in all those options.
[13:33:08] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, the class='sparkline' is a part of this dashboard and the html whereas the sparkline docs don't have that. I am having trouble amalgamiting both these hence I assumed both docs were pertinent and you could be talking about either. Also I need to make sure if the dashboard is updated, I don't make unique conflicting changes to it
[13:33:22] <taplar> http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-docs
[13:33:31] <robertmaxrees> how would i know which docs are relevant for the dashboiard?
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[13:34:08] <robertmaxrees> you need to actually fully reainitialize the widget.
[13:34:12] <taplar> the classname is of little value.  it's just used to select the element you want to chart.  it can be anything
[13:34:32] <Vivekananda> taplar -- http://34dc5567.ngrok.io/dashboard/SmartAdmin/Documentation/
[13:34:43] <Vivekananda> but is not of much help :(
[13:34:46] <taplar> i don't need those docs
[13:34:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not relevant at all here.
[13:34:50] <Vivekananda> ok
[13:34:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to read the charting docs.
[13:34:59] <taplar> your trying to figure out sparkline.  you need sparkline docs
[13:35:38] <Vivekananda> ok lemme read what you wrote above again. taplar - but is that also true if these guys custom coded stuff to make it work in a certain way in their dashboard ?
[13:35:40] <motaka2> on a windows machine I get a json response using this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/83c2602da265f8f4f7b2  but in ubuntu machine I get text, can any one tell me what is wrong ?
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda they're only autoinitializing things for you based on a class.
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to reinitialize yourself if you're changing after pageload.
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 show us the data you're getting on the two platforms.
[13:38:25] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: on ubuntu I get string(45) "/var/www/currentweb/NoonDreams/en.noondreams/"
[13:38:25] <motaka2> {"UTC_COMPANYNAME":"<span class=\"bold-alert\">NOONDREAMS<\/span>","url":"http:\/\/localhost\/currentweb\/NoonDreams\/en.noondreams\/","imgAjax":"<img class='imgAjax' src='http:\/\/localhost\/currentweb\/NoonDreams\/en.noondreams\/web\/images\/system\/interface\/ajax-loader.gif'\/>","logged":true}
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> hey paste that into a fiddle or something instead.
[13:39:04] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: ok
[13:39:14] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, okay. I am going to try this but just to repeat what I understood. if I have a div with a class='sparkline color-red'. and inside the div I have some values like <div>2 4 5</div>  if i do $(div).sparkline([2, 4, 5]) I will get it with the color red then
[13:39:31] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: I cant send you the data I get from windows machine
[13:39:40] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda you'd have to read the docs - i don't know how you control the color with sparkline.
[13:39:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd bet that their docs tell you how, though.
[13:39:54] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: Is what I sent you wrong ?
[13:40:15] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 i need to actually see the data for both in a fiddle or other paste service.
[13:42:33] <Vivekananda> taplar, in the fiddle you shared. -- http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f54jdthj/20/ . how would I get the sparkline with jquery to have the class values --       <div class="sparkline txt-color-blue hidden-mobile hidden-md hidden-sm">
[13:42:33] <Vivekananda>  ? I am trying to see if it gets those values or not
[13:42:53] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: this is what I get from the other machine  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bb8712d62c8863357f45
[13:43:00] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda you need ot initialize it correctl.
[13:43:14] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 what about the other one?
[13:44:24] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda something tells me most of those classes are used by your platform for initializing the charting widget.
[13:44:30] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to figure out how it's handling all of that.
[13:44:55] <Vivekananda> yeah I have to fiind whre they are doing what and unfortunately I have the minified css and js :(
[13:45:06] <taplar> i'm not sure you can tell it what classes to auto put on there.  haven't found that part yet in the docs.  but there is a color option
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda you can prettify it.
[13:45:23] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: thanks for your time. I found the problem
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> protip: the plugin itself doesn't use those classes taplar Vivekananda
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 cool.
[13:45:53] <Vivekananda> yep robertmaxrees I understand that
[13:46:15] <taplar> mmm, i'm not very familiar with canvas i'll admit
[13:46:53] <robertmaxrees> it's not a canvas thing - just remove all classes but the sparkline one and watch what changes
[13:47:05] <robertmaxrees> (read: nothing)
[13:47:41] <taplar> yeah
[13:48:06] <taplar> that's what i'm saying.  i didn't realise that canvas isn't affected by styles like that
[13:48:18] <km4> I can take on iframe any selectors ?
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> km4 huh?
[13:48:30] <km4> ;D
[13:48:44] <taplar> then again the fiddle doesn't have any of those classes doing anything
[13:49:07] <km4> look > past in my www <iframe> and take no html(), text() or val into the iframe site
[13:49:32] <taplar> o.O
[13:49:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:49:56] <robertmaxrees> km4 try again - what are you trying to do?
[13:50:02] <km4> moment
[13:51:11] * taplar eyes the clone
[13:52:21] <km4> on my website I have iframe. And if the iframe display I trying to get data from the iframe
[13:52:37] <km4> this posible or no ?
[13:52:38] <taplar> same domain?
[13:52:44] <km4> content
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> depends on an array of factors.
[13:52:53] <taplar> is the domain the same?
[13:53:27] <km4> no
[13:53:31] <taplar> probably not
[13:54:03] <taplar> your going to be hitting cors issues i believe
[13:54:05] <km4> ok :P
[13:54:12] <robertmaxrees> depending on the other server, yeah.
[13:54:51] <km4> the site dont have api, cant connect and display same data in my web
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> you could setup a proxy locally to get and return that data.
[13:56:21] <km4> you are frontends or full webdevelopers?
[13:57:00] <taplar> i'm backend primarily
[13:57:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm frontend primarily, but do backend as well.
[13:58:00] <km4> junior fronend I guess.
[13:58:07] <taplar> ouch
[13:58:15] <taplar> lol, that just sounds wrong, ;)
[13:58:18] <km4> html and css/less as well but js/jquery not to god
[13:58:37] <taplar> i'm elephant frontend fool!
[13:58:44] <km4> :P
[13:59:16] <km4> what framework you use in frontend ?
[13:59:33] <robertmaxrees> loaded question.
[13:59:47] <taplar> uh, gsp, or whatever grails does.  whatever framework that is, if it is one
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> depends on the project.
[14:00:09] <renka> hi robertmaxrees
[14:00:14] <km4> hm
[14:00:31] <taplar> we are planning on switching to angular later though
[14:00:53] <renka> taplar why not react?
[14:01:04] <taplar> i'm not the ux who makes the decisions, :)
[14:01:08] <km4> taplar:  what now using ?
[14:01:23] <taplar> straight grails gsps with jquery
[14:01:38] <renka> react has ssr
[14:01:51] <taplar> not sure what that is
[14:02:01] <renka> server-side-rendering
[14:02:02] <km4> in my projects only backbone ;/
[14:02:11] <taplar> ok?
[14:02:15] <robertmaxrees> km4 that's fine.
[14:02:20] <robertmaxrees> backbone has its place.
[14:10:55] <taplar> https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fstream1.gifsoup.com%2Fview1%2F4242377%2Fsleepy-cat-o.gif&f=1
[14:14:57] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[14:16:37] <km4> more cats
[14:16:45] <cats> more km4
[14:16:52] <taplar> lol
[14:16:52] <km4> ;P
[14:17:10] <taplar> everyone loves pu...... ummm
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> eeeeeeehhhhhhh
[14:17:30] <taplar> felines
[14:17:32] <Vivekananda> ok back so had to figure out how sparklines were getting initialized both in their docs and in mine
[14:24:12] <taplar> forgot my password there for a bit
[14:24:46] <taplar> Vivekananda: so progress?
[14:29:36] <Vivekananda> not much. I did find that during the page initialization they call af unction called pagefunction. Inside it there is a function call to runallCharts. it is this -- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/90c47b45f8ad74f117a4  . Now I wonder if I call runallcharts() right after populating a new div, will that make the sparklines run too
[14:29:59] <Vivekananda> ie initialize them as robertmaxree said
[14:30:11] <robertmaxrees> you probably don't have access to that function from outside the page init.
[14:30:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd just manually redo it.
[14:34:22] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I didn't quite understand. That function is being called from the page inside another function. Are you saying that if I call it directly I don't have access but this other function can have access from the same location ?
[14:34:55] <robertmaxrees> is that function defined within another function?
[14:38:23] <Vivekananda> I am searching for its funct definition ( phpstorm)
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:38:37] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to check duder
[14:38:50] <robertmaxrees> find where function runAllCharts() { is.
[14:39:04] <robertmaxrees> when you find that, look to see if that's inside of another function() {
[14:39:49] <Vivekananda> okay I got it
[14:39:55] <Vivekananda> yes it is right there sorry I am being dumb
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> so is it inside of another function?
[14:40:47] <Vivekananda> Also. the html page is calling the pagefunction(). Inside page function is called runallcharts. so html -> pagefunction --> runallchart()
[14:40:53] <Vivekananda> I am pasting it one sec
[14:41:22] <robertmaxrees> right, so runallchart is defined inside of that function, rihgt?
[14:41:30] <Vivekananda> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/90c47b45f8ad74f117a4
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to teach you to fish here.
[14:42:04] <Vivekananda> oo ok. so no I got to both.
[14:42:12] <robertmaxrees> is runAllCharts defined within another function?
[14:42:27] <Vivekananda> no it is defined in the app.js file which is a separate file
[14:42:41] <robertmaxrees> so it's just at the root level of that file, not within any other funtions?
[14:42:45] <robertmaxrees> *functions
[14:42:49] <taplar> looks global
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm getting at - the scope of that object.
[14:43:07] <Vivekananda> yes
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> if it's global then you can call it, i just wonder how efficient that'll be.
[14:43:20] <taplar> seems heavy handed
[14:43:23] <Vivekananda> root level. Prettyfied min js
[14:43:49] <Vivekananda> for the moment I just wanted it to work. I called it and no errors on console still the graph shows numericla values and not the sparkline
[14:44:07] <robertmaxrees> lol i give up.
[14:44:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to just read some docs instead of looking for a shortcut.
[14:46:00] <Vivekananda> I am trying to trace how the class = sparkline is initialized so I can redo those steps. as far as I can tell it is done by calling runallcharts() ( which is called inside the page function). so if I run either ( or both again.) I should get the functionality I want was my thinking
[14:46:22] <robertmaxrees> but that means you'll get everything else those do, as well.
[14:46:39] <robertmaxrees> the page init probably doesn't check if things are already initialized, so it'll re-do a lot of things you probably don't want it to do.
[14:47:07] <taplar> actually, i think it is.  $(".sparkline:not(:has(>canvas))")
[14:47:18] <taplar> so if that canvas exists from a previous init, it ignores
[14:47:25] <robertmaxrees> thats just the charts.
[14:47:39] <robertmaxrees> the pageinit is what i was referring to.
[14:47:54] <robertmaxrees> and the pie chart doesn't have that check.
[14:48:00] <taplar> yeah
[14:51:11] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I donn't quite know what is a 'pageInit' you keep referring to. :(. Also if you mean that by calling both functions I get everything redone , then for the moment that is okay. waht I see though is it is not getting redone and I still see numericals
[14:51:17] * taplar was just introduced to the 'selfie stick' product
[14:51:19] <taplar> crazy
[14:51:41] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda "pageinit" meaning pagefunction
[14:51:45] <robertmaxrees> or whatever that thing was called.
[14:51:50] <Vivekananda> k
[14:51:57] <robertmaxrees> and you should avoid doing it this way just because it works - it's inefficient.
[14:52:02] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[14:52:35] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I can think avoid / include after something works. At the moment it Doesn't work !
[14:53:21] <robertmaxrees> interesting - so you ignore our advice, it doesn't work, and then argue about it.
[14:53:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)_
[15:00:45] <Vivekananda> no.. umm ignore ? I was following your advice itself and testing. you said that it will work but will be inefficient. so I am trying to get it to work ( it will work) and then look for making it better ( --> ineffiient). Not sure where I didn't follow advice
[15:02:56] <robertmaxrees> i said it might work, depending.  but my original advice was to just manually initialize the charts yourself.
[15:03:10] <Vivekananda> Also I am trying to understand how it works so if I change something I know what I am doing and what the conflicts will be. If I change now and something works and something breaks I will be troubleshooting in the blind
[15:03:40] <Vivekananda> robertmaxrees, oo ok so I will try to see how to do that then
[15:04:20] <Vivekananda> I have to figure out how I can do that but also give the charts necessary bootstrap colors and css stuff. I didn't see how to do that in the documents though
[15:45:42] <Vivekananda> still getting nowhere on how to initialize the sparlines built with the class "sparkline" :(
[15:51:41] <seemikehack> Hey all, can anyone tell me why the font size in my tabs are so stinkin' huge? I mean, why. They're just too big. http://codepen.io/seemikehack/pen/MKYqaj
[15:52:08] <seemikehack> I thought I took the defaults on things. There doesn't look to be any reason why the font should be that big.
[15:54:55] <taplar2> seemikehack: it's inheriting the font size from the #toolTags div
[15:58:54] <seemikehack> taplar2, but I didn't set a font-size on #toolTabs. Or at least, I thought not. And how'd you find that out? I thought I traced the inheritance chain pretty thoroughly, but I guess not.
[15:59:52] <taplar2> i just inspected the element and looked at the rules, back tracking through any thing that said font: inherit;
[16:00:19] <taplar2> then i saw the font on toolTags was set and i toggled it off and the elements shrank
[16:01:47] <seemikehack> taplar2, ah, gotcha. That's so weird, though, the demos don't show anything like that.
[16:02:27] <taplar2> well, the font is set using the 'em' unit, which is a relative unit
[16:02:38] <taplar2> so things can act differently depending on your base font sizes
[16:06:38] <seemikehack> taplar2, good point. Thanks for the tips.
[16:36:14] <teaearlgraycold> So I'm trying to use selectors on an HTML string - and I can successfully select out elements by their type ("div", "button"), but trying to select by IDs or classes doesn't work it seems.
[16:36:38] <teaearlgraycold> The same selectors work on similar HTML if that HTML is an actual web-page
[16:37:14] <teaearlgraycold> I'm just doing $(html_string).find(selector)
[16:44:54] <taplar> what's the actual code line?
[16:48:01] <justaskingaround>  If you had to start all over, relearn everything about web technology, where would you start?
[16:48:49] <taplar> html
[16:50:53] <seemikehack> justaskingaround, http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/past.html
[16:57:53] <Vivekananda> hey taplar I figured it out. the problem is solved but I still don't understand something. so I do an ajax get, get all values. I change inner html of sparkline div only ( with values). I then call runAllCharts(). BUT, if I call runAllcharts from within the ajax.done(){} block then it works. If I call it from anywhere outside it ( even later in synchronous order) it doesn't. Why would that be ?
[16:58:25] <NoiseEee> because ajax is not synchronous?
[16:58:35] <shoky> Vivekananda: if you want something to happen after an ajax request responds, you must do it in the ajax's callback
[17:00:50] <teaearlgraycold> taplar: http://pastie.org/10621673
[17:01:09] <taplar> lol, no
[17:01:23] <taplar> what are the parts?
[17:01:35] <taplar> new_html and selector
[17:02:02] <Vivekananda> shoky, so basically I have ( bought) a dashboard with demo sparklines ( and other stuff on it). They use a custom class called 'sparkline'. they hardcoded values for the div (having this class). Now I want to update the values. I did by replacing innerHTML. The result was I was getting numerical values instead of a sparkline. I assumed if I call the runAllCHArts() function it should work anywhere as long as I call it after
[17:02:02] <Vivekananda> changing the div. It doesn't. why is that ?
[17:02:21] <km4> gn :)
[17:02:50] <shoky> Vivekananda: i have no idea what you're talking about. i was just answering your ajax question
[17:02:57] <Vivekananda> here is the function -- ( box 2 ) --  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/90c47b45f8ad74f117a4
[17:03:10] <Vivekananda> shoky, I gave a brief intro. did it make any sense ?
[17:03:23] <shoky> basically - if you run something not when its supposed to be run,  stuff won't work.  :)
[17:03:34] <shoky> apply that idea to whatever you're doing :)
[17:03:40] <shoky> key word is "when"
[17:04:06] <Vivekananda> hmmm . okay let me show you something.
[17:04:15] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/gj7mbgrg/
[17:04:33] <taplar> Vivekananda: you understand that the logic past the ajax call can/will execute before the ajax finishes right?
[17:04:48] <teaearlgraycold> taplar: http://pastie.org/private/btorng0lct9apqhd7regdw
[17:05:02] <teaearlgraycold> When calling the selector on the HTML it returns []
[17:05:04] <Vivekananda> taplar, could you rephrase what you said
[17:05:10] <shoky> Vivekananda: anyway you said you figured it out. so why are you showing us this
[17:05:26] <taplar> teaearlgraycold: your probably having an issue with the id being a top level element
[17:05:29] <teaearlgraycold> Vivekananda: The AJAX is by definitiion Async.
[17:05:31] <taplar> try filter instead
[17:05:36] <teaearlgraycold> Thanks
[17:05:39] <Vivekananda> shoky, I figured out the problem but I don't know why the same function will repaint the div when inside done but not when outside
[17:05:53] <Vivekananda> just trying to understand
[17:06:02] <taplar> teaearlgraycold: or append the html to a parent and then you can do find
[17:06:09] <shoky> Vivekananda:   because stuff you put outside will run right away. only stuff that you put INSIDE will run AFTER the ajax is done
[17:06:29] <teaearlgraycold> taplar: filter worked. Thanks!
[17:06:31] <shoky> Vivekananda: that's exaclty what the ajax done callback is for - to put stuff in there that will run AFTER the ajax is done. if its not in there it will run before
[17:06:34] <taplar> cool
[17:06:41] <Vivekananda> shoky, oo yeah (facepalm) and you already said that right !!.
[17:06:46] <Vivekananda> shit my brain ins't working
[17:06:50] <Vivekananda> need some coffe
[17:06:56] <tinku> hey is there an interactive way to learn jquery?
[17:07:04] <NoiseEee> Vivekananda: the ajax function runs, it goes on to the next function to run - it doesn't wait for the ajax to finish.
[17:07:05] <shoky> Vivekananda:    console.log('this runs first');   $.ajax(...).done(function() {   console.log('this runs last');  });        console.log('this runs second');
[17:07:14] <Vivekananda> tinku, yeah but I doubt anyone her ewill recommend it :)
[17:07:30] <shoky> Vivekananda:  the console logs there will be in the order they say.   so the last console.log that is OUTSIDE Will be run before the one inside
[17:07:56] <Vivekananda> NoiseEee, so it would be a nice experiment to make a funtion run after waiting for say 20 seconds
[17:08:04] <Vivekananda> that will then repaint as expected right ?
[17:08:11] <shoky> Vivekananda: this is what it means to say that ajax is async.  calling $.ajax will return right away and the next line will execute right away, much  earlier than when the ajax is actually finished
[17:08:13] <Vivekananda> hmmm but yeah I am just being stupid
[17:08:15] <taplar> tinku: i'm sure there are some course sites out there.  but you can just pop open a few jsfiddle.net 's and try stuff on try.jquery.com
[17:08:16] <tinku> it would be great if someone  recommends me a resource
[17:08:20] <NoiseEee> Vivekananda: no, that is *preciesely* the reason to use the CALLBACK
[17:08:21] <Vivekananda> shoky, no I know async
[17:08:27] <Vivekananda> I was being stupid
[17:08:33] <Vivekananda> NoiseEee, yeah I realize
[17:08:37] <tinku> thanks vivekanada
[17:08:40] <taplar> tinku: try.jquery.com and/or learn.jquery.com
[17:08:55] <shoky> Vivekananda: yes. why no? :)  then now you know it again.
[17:09:53] <Vivekananda> tinku, btw my personal choice would be something quick from codeacademy  or something similar
[17:10:16] <Vivekananda> but let me tell you that you will actually learn something only when you tackle chanllenging problems
[17:11:29] <taplar> lol
[17:12:12] <Vivekananda> shoky, no meaning ( you might be thinkign I don't know what async is coz you told me what it is but I do know it so a no for that ) :)
[17:12:33] <Vivekananda> taplar, don't laugh at me :).
[17:12:39] <shoky> Vivekananda:  it doesn't matter what i think, nobody's judging anyone here
[17:12:42] <taplar> no no, i was laughing at the nick change
[17:13:18] <Vivekananda> taplar, yeah I know I was being a hardhead with this particular problem but I wasn't giving up :). So that is good enough for me :)
[17:13:37] <Vivekananda> ok another small issue
[17:14:59] <Vivekananda> I am uploading this to another innerHTML - &nbsp;45% . when I reload the page only the 45%shows. is there a better way to get the whole thing in there ?
[17:15:34] <taplar> you want the &nbsp to be literal?
[17:16:56] <taplar> btw a better approach might be to add some styling to one of the elements to apply some sort of margin or padding instead of injecting a &nbsp;
[17:16:58] <Vivekananda> no the upward arrow mark so the enclosing div should paint it
[17:17:53] <Vivekananda> sorry I am wrong it seems
[17:17:58] <Vivekananda> let me check and get back
[17:25:14] <taplar> short caffeine high
[17:30:27] <MarcWeber> Which component is like a select but allows entering a new text value as well?
[17:30:38] <taplar> autocomplete?
[17:30:44] <taplar> or autosuggest
[17:30:47] <taplar> whatever the term is
[17:30:59] <greenfriday> COMBO BOX
[17:31:58] <taplar> ah, cool
[17:54:36] <noahmg123> the font family 'slick' for the slick slider is not working. It brings up a thin serif font.
[17:54:42] <noahmg123> it *uses
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[17:57:44] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing references to that font?
[17:57:58] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: in the default css actually
[17:58:04] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[17:58:13] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: just a moment
[17:58:33] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: btw. this is the font for the arrows.
[18:00:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any reference to the "slick" font-family.
[18:00:30] <robertmaxrees> sooo..
[18:00:39] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: If you right click the arrows in the examples here (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) you will see a before element in the containing div with that font family set.
[18:00:52] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> that's where it is.  okay.  are you including all CSS files?
[18:01:12] <robertmaxrees> there are two that you need.
[18:01:22] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah. as far as I know. What two do I need?
[18:01:35] <robertmaxrees> slick.css and slick-theme.css i'd guess.
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> slick-theme references an .eot file, so make sure you hgave that, as well.
[18:02:07] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah I have both.
[18:02:14] <robertmaxrees> and the eot file?
[18:02:21] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: let me check.
[18:03:50] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ahhh... that's it. I moved my CSS and JS elsewhere, I forgot about the fonts. Let me see if moving them back works (most likey it will).
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> ;) there you go.
[18:06:28] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: Yay. it worked. Thank you.
[19:39:43] <MalditoDev> HI, Is there a way to see what jquery event/script ran on click?
[19:39:58] <MalditoDev> Like in chrome dev tools?
[19:41:31] <robertmaxrees> see the "event listeners" tab in the inspector?
[19:42:01] <printForever> ola robertmaxrees
[19:43:17] <MalditoDev> oh great yes thank you robertmaxrees
[19:59:45] <MalditoDev> how can I find where the function updateOrderTotal(); would be at?
[19:59:46] <MalditoDev> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=6t0phj&s=9
[20:00:14] <robertmaxrees> grep the codebase.
[20:00:31] <MalditoDev> never greped before
[20:01:03] <MalditoDev> got it, I guess phpstorm has a go to ability
[20:01:04] <MalditoDev> :)
[20:01:08] <robertmaxrees> or use your IDE.
[20:01:53] <MalditoDev> Thanks robertmaxrees foudn it with phpstorm
[20:02:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:03:30] <printForever> phpStorm 9 sucks
[20:03:42] <printForever> 8 too
[20:03:47] <robertmaxrees> *php sucks
[20:03:52] <robertmaxrees> there i fixed that for you ;)
[20:03:53] <printForever> OH SNAP!
[20:04:53] <MalditoDev> you really seem to feel strongly about that printForever?
[20:06:41] <robertmaxrees> is that a question?
[20:06:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[20:07:15] <MalditoDev> yeah as in whats a better IDE to use?
[20:07:48] <robertmaxrees> oh.  are you actually working with PHP?
[20:07:57] <MalditoDev> today I am
[20:08:01] <robertmaxrees> that's too bad.
[20:08:10] <MalditoDev> LOL, I guess
[20:08:15] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if intellij has a php plugin
[20:08:24] <MalditoDev> they do
[20:08:47] <MalditoDev> right now though...jquery isi kicking my butt
[20:09:03] <robertmaxrees> nothing you've asked about has been jquery related fwiw.
[20:09:30] <MalditoDev> the seeing the event listen question was :)
[20:09:35] <MalditoDev> listener
[20:09:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.  every major browser has that feature ;)
[20:10:57] <printForever> MalditoDev, what version are you using?
[20:11:04] <MalditoDev> 10
[20:12:03] <printForever> Is 10 out???
[20:12:10] <MalditoDev> ok Keep in mind I'm a bit new but I'm going to ask for help on a jquery issue. http://skinprov.com/checkout/step_02_billing.php?contactId=234208&inf_contact_key=2fc5ae8993ccba624aa073d0fd31765a510b7c1965655e09765f23efd683ac71&inf_field_FirstName=Elvis001&inf_field_LastName=Elvis001&inf_field_Email=elvis001%40gmail.com&inf_field_Address2Street1=123+test+street&inf_field_City2=reno&inf_field_State2=nv&inf_field_PostalCode2=89506&inf_field_Co
[20:12:10] <MalditoDev> untry2=Australia&inf_Rx4sIJpsKsb4bGbZ=&inf_option_FreeGiftSelection=556
[20:12:16] <robertmaxrees> woahj.
[20:12:17] <printForever> it seems it is
[20:12:19] <robertmaxrees> that split onto 2 lines.
[20:12:28] <robertmaxrees> and don't link us to the page.
[20:12:31] <robertmaxrees> make a test case.
[20:12:38] <printForever> :)))))))
[20:12:41] <MalditoDev> sorry
[20:12:57] <printForever> MalditoDev, no one cares... "The Most Intelligent PHP IDE" - lol
[20:13:07] <printForever> phpStorm got slow and sluggish
[20:13:11] <MalditoDev> I've asked for help before and I got bombarded to link the page with the issue
[20:13:23] <robertmaxrees> MalditoDev here we ask for test cases here.
[20:13:38] <robertmaxrees> instead of the full page.
[20:13:39] <printForever> I haven't uploaded to 10, but 9 welcome window, where it lists previous projects its rediculously stupid
[20:13:54] <robertmaxrees> hey printForever did you have anything constructive and on topic to add?
[20:13:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:14:10] <printForever> robertmaxrees, yes... use phpStorm 7
[20:14:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not on topic ;)
[20:14:29] <printForever> well, he has to edit the file... doesn't he?
[20:14:41] <robertmaxrees> nice try.  anyway!
[20:14:45] <MalditoDev> darn I'm trying to fix something someone else wrote and I would't know what part of the code exactly to rip out to create a test case
[20:15:03] <robertmaxrees> MalditoDev maybe try describing the problem?
[20:15:19] <MalditoDev> for what its worth I use netbeans too
[20:17:42] <MalditoDev> ok its a jQuery problem I believe. The issues is on an ecommerce checkout page, when you select a radio button named 'International shipping' the jquery is supposed to update the shipping price field and order total fields. The Order total field is updating but the shipping fields is not
[20:18:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a really long description.
[20:18:08] <robertmaxrees> can you reduce it down? since it cut off for me.
[20:18:21] <robertmaxrees> or did you just miss a perido in there?
[20:18:56] <MalditoDev> oh that was it
[20:18:59] <MalditoDev> .
[20:19:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're missing an event binding then.
[20:19:53] <haroldjfks> hello, put I have a tr:contains ("something").css display none.... on document ready BUT then a function by href click does something else on the table row... how can I prevent that the table row is displayed... ? thanks
[20:20:21] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks wut
[20:20:58] <haroldjfks> robertmaxrees: eg. $( "tr:contains('Unavailable !')" ).css( "display", "none" );
[20:21:06] <robertmaxrees> right, i followed that part.
[20:21:16] <robertmaxrees> the second part doesn't make any sense.
[20:21:23] <haroldjfks> BUT...then on the page there is a href
[20:21:43] * taplar eyes the big but
[20:21:47] <haroldjfks> by clicking that the tr (table row) will be displayed, anyway...
[20:21:51] <guideX> see any problems with this? $("#txtShippingFirstName").val($("#txtBillingFirstName").val());
[20:21:53] <haroldjfks> I need to avoid that behavior...
[20:21:59] <robertmaxrees> haroldjfks then change that handler.
[20:22:03] <robertmaxrees> the other one i mean.
[20:22:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, css.
[20:22:07] <taplar> guideX, nope
[20:22:19] <guideX> hrm weirdness.. doesn't work at all.. i'll keep playing with it, thx
[20:22:27] <guideX> I know it usually works!
[20:22:29] <taplar> console log the two make sure your finding them
[20:22:37] <taplar> aka, the selector is valid
[20:22:40] <guideX> ah yes, o k
[20:22:41] <MalditoDev> ok I'm going to take this slow: The statement on kline 17 is simply going to run the uopdateOrderTotal(); function when the radio button named 'OrderShipping' is clicked right?
[20:22:42] <MalditoDev> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=6t0phj&s=9#.VmjOW-MwYck
[20:22:56] <robertmaxrees> MalditoDev screenshots aren't helpful.  code it.
[20:22:57] <robertmaxrees> *is
[20:23:05] <robertmaxrees> screenshots of code are painful.
[20:23:11] <MalditoDev> oh ok
[20:23:12] <taplar> and hard to debug
[20:23:21] <guideX> oh
[20:23:34] <guideX> I feel pretty dumb, not even hitting the function lol
[20:23:37] <taplar> :)
[20:23:43] <guideX> well thanks for pointing out the obvious :)
[20:23:53] <taplar> my primary job here
[20:23:55] <MalditoDev> asking for help the right way is an artform :)
[20:23:58] <guideX> I can imagine
[20:24:11] <taplar> nah, it's all good
[20:24:43] <guideX> it's because I assumed the checkbox onclick even is more trustworthy than jquery
[20:25:05] <taplar> two different routes to the same solution
[20:25:10] <robertmaxrees> you usually don't want click events from inputs anyway.
[20:25:10] <taplar> on() is preferred now days
[20:25:32] <robertmaxrees> MalditoDev usually we ask for a reduced test case.  otherwise you're asking us to figure out a bunch of your code.
[20:25:32] <guideX> robertmaxrees: why's that, it seems pretty clean no?
[20:25:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't care if the element was clicked.
[20:25:45] <robertmaxrees> you care if it was changed.
[20:25:51] <taplar> focus would be more accurate
[20:26:14] <taplar> or relevant
[20:27:38] <robertmaxrees> sure, or whatever event it should be.
[20:27:46] <robertmaxrees> but click is rarely what you want when handling forms.
[20:28:55] <guideX> heh
[20:29:19] <guideX> this is so weird, it's like onchange, onclick, onfocus have no effect with this checkbox, going to switch to the jquery function, but still very peculiar
[20:29:30] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[20:30:37] <guideX> none
[20:30:40] <guideX> very interesting
[20:31:00] <guideX> let me make a paste..
[20:35:12] <guideX> http://pastebin.com/j6PChPTF
[20:35:43] <taplar> your defining the function after the html
[20:35:53] <taplar> it's not defined at the time of binding
[20:35:56] <robertmaxrees> and you shouldn't use onchange anyway, so .on() is the solution after all :)
[20:36:06] <guideX> taplar: welll, it's in another file actually
[20:36:08] <guideX> global.js
[20:36:11] <taplar> same thing
[20:36:24] <guideX> but global.js is at the bottom
[20:36:28] <robertmaxrees> needs to come before.
[20:36:29] <guideX> hrm, but i'll check that out
[20:36:57] <guideX> oh needs to be before?
[20:37:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[20:37:03] <guideX> the js needs to be like in the head
[20:37:06] <robertmaxrees> but really, use .on()
[20:37:08] <taplar> lol
[20:37:09] <guideX> ah ok
[20:37:16] <taplar> you really should leave it at the bottom and switch to on()
[20:37:25] <guideX> but, wouldn't I get a "GetSwap isn't defined" or something?
[20:37:36] <taplar> not if you bind with on()
[20:37:37] <guideX> chrome console doesn't say that
[20:37:48] <robertmaxrees> then you're filtering those errors or something else is wrong.
[20:37:53] <robertmaxrees> do it with .on(), move on.
[20:37:55] <guideX> hmm, I'll change to .on, it's just a minor mystery
[20:38:31] <taplar> you can move it before the element and see if it changes
[20:38:42] <taplar> but i'm 99.99% sure that's the issue with the current layout
[20:39:18] <guideX> .on same thing
[20:39:24] <guideX> this checkbox just won't cooperate
[20:39:32] <guideX> can't get an alert out of it
[20:39:35] <taplar> how are you doing the on?
[20:39:46] <taplar> update your snipplet
[20:39:47] <guideX> $("#chkSwapAddress").on(function (e) { alert("HEY"); });
[20:40:03] <guideX> hm ok
[20:40:24] <guideX> oops that's wrong
[20:40:26] <guideX> no wonder :P
[20:40:51] <guideX> I must be gettin' tired :P
[20:41:35] <guideX> ok cool, $('#chkSwapAddress').change(function () { works fine
[20:41:50] <guideX> i'll just use it
[20:41:51] <taplar> on('change', function() { ...
[20:42:09] <guideX> ok cool, thanks i'l try that instead
[20:42:29] <taplar> it's the same thing, but that version is more easily switched to a delegate if you want to later
[20:42:34] <guideX> this works fine $('#chkSwapAddress').on('change', function () {
[20:42:38] <guideX> thanks again
[20:42:58] <guideX> itg's just weird, onclick, onchange, onfocus, all seem worthless
[20:43:03] <guideX> for a checkbox
[20:43:05] <guideX> oh well :P
[20:43:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't want them anyway ;)
[20:53:53] <anonymousVan> hi
[20:55:08] <anonymousVan> how accomplish like this. var arr = 'arr_'; var num = 1; var combine = arr + num; combine.push(something);
[20:55:22] <anonymousVan> It's saying combine.push is not a function
[20:55:34] <anonymousVan> I want it like that because the variable num keeps on changing
[21:01:22] <haroldjfks> is there something like .change but for any element? eg. span... eg. a span class or any other elemeent? thanks
[21:02:03] <haroldjfks> that is, when the text into that span changes... do something. Does it exist?
[21:16:01] <taplar> anonymousVan, push is an array function
[21:16:51] <taplar> haroldjfks, what your asking about sounds similar to an observer
[21:19:19] <taplar> haroldjfks, though as far as i'm aware they are not widely supported yet
[21:19:57] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe
[22:11:37] <MalditoDev> Can anyone suggest jquery syntax to perform a click on a radio button if a certain $_GET param is set?
[22:38:03] <viscera> Am I blind or does the Events guide not tell you when to actually register the handler?
[22:39:44] <viscera> AFACT, it just points to the MDN events reference for a list of events, and presumably you choose which to do the registration under, with no recommendation
[22:43:26] <viscera> e.g. if I'm using jQuery to select certain elements on which to set a click event handler, where does this code go?
[23:40:09] <b4b> hey using jquery migrate allows for arbritary script to be executed within a selector
[23:40:27] <b4b> are there any patches to fix this
[23:40:47] <b4b> its an old app cant really sanitize all selectors
[23:51:12] <printForever> shoky, are you here?
[23:51:35] <printForever> Select2 closeOnSelect does not work :(
[23:51:50] <printForever> if its either set to true or false, no difference
