[00:45:47] <richardr> Are there any stable libraries that allow me to set the outerWidth/outerHeight of an element? (e.g. - it takes into account padding, margin, borders for me and just gives me an element that meets my width input)
[00:47:12] <coldhead> ?outerwidth
[00:47:12] <bot-t> .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[00:47:22] <coldhead> ?outerheight
[00:47:22] <bot-t> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[00:47:29] <coldhead> is jQuery stable enough for you?
[00:47:36] <coldhead> those are builtin
[00:47:38] <richardr> Set*
[00:47:41] <richardr> Not get ;)
[00:47:49] <coldhead> oh right
[00:47:59] <coldhead> i'm not sure how that would work
[00:48:19] <richardr> At the point of calculation, these elements don't exist
[00:48:25] <coldhead> sorry richardr, it's my first day using jQuery
[00:49:07] <gerryvdm_> hello, as documented, i noticed that form.serialize() does not include any pressed button's value, but what would be the correct way to include it
[00:50:33] <coldhead> gerryvdm_: the cleanest way seems to be to bind a click handler to the buttons and have them insert the right data as a hidden input
[00:51:26] <gerryvdm_> coldhead: ok i'll try that out, thank you. the click handler on the button does precede the form's submit i suppose?
[00:51:39] <coldhead> hopefully :)
[00:51:46] <coldhead> it's much less useful after
[00:51:57] <coldhead> but yes, the click happens first
[00:52:07] <coldhead> wouldn't be much use after
[00:52:23] <coldhead> that'll burn you if they tab to the button and hit enter i think
[00:52:26] <coldhead> it's a damn shame
[00:53:05] <gerryvdm_> mm
[00:53:42] <Ankabout> how can I check if I have a certain jquery plugin installed?
[00:53:50] <Ankabout> I'm using a cms and it might be installed by default
[00:54:00] <coldhead> if ($.fn.somePlugin)
[00:54:04] <coldhead> usually
[00:54:15] <coldhead> s/$/jQuery/ might be a surer bet
[00:54:45] <Ankabout> and is backgroundColor such a plugin then?
[00:55:05] <Ankabout> it seems I need a plugin if I want to fade my background-color through a certain array of colours
[00:55:56] <coldhead> that's right, you do
[00:56:03] <amcsi_work> hello
[00:56:07] <amcsi_work> how do I select 0 elements?
[00:56:14] <Nomikos> You just did.
[00:56:34] <Nomikos> Can you specify?
[00:57:11] <amcsi_work> how do I make a $(selector) selection to select 0 elements?
[00:57:22] <amcsi_work> $(null) doesn't seem to work
[00:57:48] <Nomikos> $('#nonExistingID') should do it, but why would you want to?
[00:58:00] <amcsi_work> to ad elements to it in a for loop
[00:58:09] <amcsi_work> add*
[00:58:19] <Cork> amcsi_work: $([])
[00:58:27] <amcsi_work> thank you!
[00:58:45] <Nomikos> There's a usecase and a solution for the strangest things :-)
[00:58:55] <amcsi_work> although the nonExistingID seems good too, but the empty array is still a bit safer, and probably faster too
[00:59:06] <Nomikos> yeah, go with that :-)
[00:59:12] <Cork> no the id will still be searched for
[00:59:21] <Cork> so it causes more process work
[00:59:37] <coldhead> but the [] has to init an empty array!!!
[00:59:38] <gerryvdm_> coldhead: the click event seems to fire even with keyboard navigation, so yay
[00:59:41] <Cork> and id is farly cheap, but still more costly then nothing :)
[00:59:42] <Ankabout> why doesn't this work for example: http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/tnC93/
[00:59:47] <coldhead> good work, gerryvdm_!
[00:59:47] <gerryvdm_> or at least it does in webkit
[00:59:49] <coldhead> ?hi5
[00:59:50] <bot-t> ‚Åµ
[00:59:56] <amcsi_work> that's what I said, yes
[01:00:06] <Ankabout> it's a simple example that should work I think...
[01:00:22] <Nomikos> Ankabout: you want to click the jQuery UI checkbox
[01:00:46] <Cork> Ankabout: you need jquery ui
[01:00:46] <Ankabout> ohhh I need jq ui?
[01:00:47] <Ankabout> haha
[01:00:48] <Ankabout> thanks
[01:00:50] <Nomikos> That's what enables background color animations, IIRC, get it at http://jqueryui.com/download
[01:01:00] <Ankabout> so simple :)
[01:01:11] <Ankabout> Nomikos, yeah I'll need a module in my cms, but that's not a problem
[01:01:13] <Ankabout> thanks!!!
[01:01:26] <Nomikos> :)
[01:05:54] <Ankabout> Nomikos, hmm it seems I should have it already. is there a simple test I can do to see if jquery ui is installed/enabled?
[01:06:43] <VagaStorm> I get parentsUntil("DIV").offset().left = undefined, I thought you could get the position of any element that way
[01:06:50] <Nomikos> Ankabout: try to animate the background ;-) can you find the library mentioned/included in the source of the html anywhere?
[01:07:06] <Cork> Ankabout: alert($.ui.version)
[01:07:27] * Nomikos yields. again. :-p
[01:07:42] <Ankabout> 1.8.7 so that seems ok then
[01:07:49] <Ankabout> I knew it must be me typo'ing
[01:10:04] <killown> Do anyone know a good plugin for search html tables with pagination like quicksearch?
[01:10:37] <amcsi_work> ooooh
[01:10:44] <amcsi_work> it seems $(null) does work to sleect 0 elements
[01:11:05] <amcsi_work> just I was an idiot and forgot that selection.add returns, not pushes
[01:11:22] <Cork> classic
[01:11:36] <Cork> did the same the first time i used it
[01:11:41] <amcsi_work> :D
[01:11:43] <amcsi_work> is there a reference version of add?
[01:12:05] <Cork> no
[01:12:27] <Cork> amcsi_work: if you mean add the the current object
[01:12:42] <amcsi_work> not as if its very processor intensive making new objects
[01:12:51] <amcsi_work> yea, add to the current object
[01:13:03] <Cork> its not THAT expensive
[01:13:07] <amcsi_work> I see, okay, thanks
[01:13:09] <Cork> far from actually
[01:13:29] <amcsi_work> yea, the methods are in the prototype anyway
[01:13:37] <Cork> its much less expensive in js then in ex. c or java
[01:14:07] <amcsi_work> cool
[01:14:13] <Ankabout> Nomikos, is my version maybe too old? the exact same code from the fiddle doesn't work on my site. and it says UI 1.8.7 is installed, so obviously running too
[01:14:39] <Cork> Ankabout: no color animation works in 1.8.7
[01:14:46] <Ankabout> ah ok.
[01:14:50] <Ankabout> strange
[01:15:16] <Ankabout> updating it quickly anyways, but how strange that it doesn't work. console doesn't give any warnings either
[01:16:47] <Nomikos> Ankabout: I guess this isn't live?
[01:17:01] <Ankabout> pm?
[01:17:46] * coldhead faps
[01:30:03] <jigal> how can i rewrite this to a working piece? $('#'+ form.attr('id') +' .prefillField[title]').each(function() {
[01:31:24] <Bartzy> Hi
[01:31:35] <Bartzy> Is there a difference between :first and .first() ?
[01:31:44] <Bartzy> performance or otherwise ?
[01:34:38] <quicksilver> Bartzy: not a significant one. .first() will be a bit faster since it doesn't have to parse a string to work
[01:35:03] <Bartzy> quicksilver: OK, thank you.
[01:35:29] <quicksilver> jigal: that will find all things with class "prefillField" and a title attribute within the form. What do you want it to do?
[01:36:02] <quicksilver> (Although, $('#'+form.attr('id')+' blah') is a funny way to write form.find('blah') )
[01:40:22] <troubleman> Hey!
[01:43:34] <amcsi_work> with Class.prototype.fn, does the fn see the properties that are in the instantiated object's scope?
[01:48:46] <amcsi_work> okay, that was a stupid question
[01:49:02] <amcsi_work> the answer is, the scope it sees is the scope it is called from :P
[01:49:25] <amcsi_work> since I usually call it with this.fn, it sees everything this sees
[01:50:31] <ryan_sp> will ('.selector').each(function() { }) run faster than doing say, ('div div div').each(function() { }) where div div div has .selector
[01:51:19] <quicksilver> ryan_sp: in some browsers selecting by class is faster than other ways of selecting, I believe.
[01:51:53] <dinosaadeh> hi guys, is there a way i can append a node while referring to the current node? i mean i have an input and i want to put something right next to it
[01:53:55] <quicksilver> ??after
[01:54:09] <troubleman> Do I still need hoverIntent or does jQuery / jQuery UI now have something similar? hoverIntent - http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html - works like (and was derived from) jQuery's built-in hover. However, instead of immediately calling the onMouseOver function, it waits until the user's mouse slows down enough before making the call.
[01:54:17] <quicksilver> dinosaadeh: the jquery site is down for me at the moment but I think you're looking for "after"
[01:54:50] <dinosaadeh> quicksilver: thanks a lot! =D no matter how experienced i get in jquery i always learn something
[01:55:02] <quicksilver> dinosaadeh: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/after/
[01:56:11] <Aamir> We shouldn't append inside a loop. What about appending to <ul> which is already written on the page?
[01:56:49] <Aamir> So the question is how to append <li>s to an empty jQuery object and at the end append that to <ul>
[01:58:00] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/troubleman/MmhjG/ - how do I make it so that when "Add to cart" is clicked, #dropdown_cart appears for 5 seconds and then disappears?
[01:58:03] <troubleman> Greetings Aamir :)
[01:58:31] <Aamir> hi troubleman  :)
[02:01:00] <krad> hi.  does jquery have a digest build in authentication mechanism?
[02:01:15] <krad> built*
[02:02:17] <Aamir> troubleman: setTimeout?
[02:03:02] <Aamir> troubleman:  http://jsfiddle.net/MmhjG/1/
[02:04:00] <Merimac> Hi there !
[02:04:26] <Aamir> troubleman: something i done in old days: http://www.mannfriday.com/store.php :D
[02:04:34] <Merimac> Is that possible to use de dynamix collection with jQuery.each() ?
[02:04:43] <troubleman> Aamir: aaaaaaaah
[02:04:48] <troubleman> jazzakallahu khair ya HABIBI!!!
[02:04:51] <troubleman> thanks a lot brotherman
[02:04:54] <troubleman> power to the people :D
[02:05:06] <Ankabout> Nomikos, where did you get that error? Warning: Expected color but found '#993399px'
[02:05:09] <Aamir> troubleman: norries brother :P
[02:05:09] <Ankabout> firebug?
[02:05:11] <muzone> heheh
[02:05:27] <muzone> good vibes
[02:05:28] <Merimac> something like jQuery.each(data.countryList + this.lang, function(index, itemData) {
[02:05:39] <Nomikos> Ankabout: Firefox, Error Console (Cmd-shift-J on OS X)
[02:06:09] <Ankabout> ah thanks
[02:07:04] <Merimac> in my case data.countryList is data from json
[02:08:00] <mw__> Gd day, I have a problem with JSON object - when I use serialize() method i get JSON Parse error while trying to send data to my php file via ajax()
[02:08:09] <Ankabout> Nomikos, do I maybe need the color plugin as well asl UI?
[02:08:18] <mw__> What should I do?
[02:09:40] <Nomikos> Ankabout: hmm.. something I hadn't thought of, the UI thing is configurable as in you can in/exclude parts of it - possibly your version is missing the animate-colors part? I don't know of a color plugin and it worked for me locally
[02:10:00] <Ankabout> I'll try and include it
[02:11:37] <jacof> jQuery('#header a').attr('target','_parent'); <- not working for a reason. the a links are not immediate children of #header. maybe that ?
[02:12:21] <krad> how to instruct the browser to use digest authentication?
[02:12:44] <Merimac> nobody How can I access a json part dynamically ?
[02:13:02] <Merimac> like data.countryList + this.lang
[02:13:03] <Ankabout> Nomikos, that was it!
[02:13:11] * Ankabout parties and passes around some beers
[02:13:15] <Nomikos> \o/
[02:13:29] <Nomikos> must remember that one :)
[02:13:30] <DarsVaeda> hi, I want to have only the current year selectable in the datepicker, is there a way to dynamically do it?
[02:13:34] <Ankabout> yeah
[02:13:46] <Ankabout> now all I have to do is figure out how to loop through an array of colours...
[02:13:55] <DarsVaeda> I know there is daterange, but how do I set it dynamically to the current year
[02:17:21] <De|work> DarsVaeda, http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#method-setDate
[02:18:04] <DarsVaeda> that sets the current date
[02:18:22] <thun> I have a set of rows in  table. When one gets edited I popup a page and post via ajax... once the results load when I call $(this) it refers to the top level DOM of the page
[02:18:42] <thun> How can I find my place again in the table after the ajax call?
[02:19:28] <mw__> Anyone?
[02:20:26] <De|work> DarsVaeda, you need data range, that allows to set dates only in "this" year?
[02:20:47] <DarsVaeda> no only the "next" year
[02:20:58] <DarsVaeda> from 1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012
[02:21:05] <De|work> mw__, http://jsonlint.com/
[02:21:09] <DarsVaeda> but next year the year after and so on
[02:21:28] <DarsVaeda> I'm currently fiddling with new Date and then calculating the range
[02:22:24] <mw__> I don't really know what to paste there
[02:22:26] <De|work> DarsVaeda, where's problem? var date = new Date(), year = date.getFullYear(), nextYear = year + 1;
[02:22:29] <mw__> was there yesterday
[02:22:30] <mw__> ;)
[02:22:32] <jigal> should i use single or double quotes for selectors
[02:22:34] <jigal> ?
[02:22:41] <De|work> mw__, you use that to validate your JSON format
[02:23:01] <De|work> mw__, obviously, you have malformed JSON, or unescaped chars, etc...
[02:23:25] <mw__> but it's only when I use serialize method
[02:23:47] <De|work> jigal, doesn't care, if you use inside selector a double quotes, then use single quotes outside, and vica-versa
[02:24:30] <De|work> mw__, then alert(data) to see, what is that, you are trying to serialize, try pasting your data in jsfiddle.net
[02:24:43] <mw__> already alerted
[02:24:43] <mw__> sec
[02:24:49] <jigal>  De|work tnx
[02:25:02] <De|work> jigal, 'input[type="checkbox"]' for example
[02:26:12] <mw__> http://jsfiddle.net/MgqMz/
[02:26:18] <De|work> mw__, best thing, would be to use some sort of JS debugger, like Firebug for Firefox, or Developer Console (F12) for Chrome, there is one for newest Internet Explorer too
[02:27:13] <mw__> Maybe serialize method is not giving proper JSON object.
[02:28:33] <De|work> mw__, you should have put your form, you are trying to serialize, inside jsfiddle, not that data
[02:29:10] <De|work> mw__, ".serialize() Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission"
[02:29:54] <mw__> I've read that I can use serialize for JSON
[02:33:48] <De|work> mw__, you can create a <FORM> element in your html code, use jQuery to convert data of it into JSON format, so you can send it through AJAX, to server, on server side, you need to decode JSON format, so you can work on it, server can send back JSON format data, on your browser, you should convert received JSON data back to JavaScript, so you can work on it...
[02:33:56] <De|work> serialize is just for first step
[02:34:12] <De|work> mw__, you see http://jsfiddle.net/MgqMz/1/
[02:34:44] <Cork> serialize has nothing to do with json
[02:34:48] <Cork> it sends params not json
[02:35:08] <De|work> damnit, you are right
[02:35:26] <mw__> I have read that i need external library for serialization to json
[02:35:28] <De|work> serialize is just to send GET/POST
[02:35:30] <Cork> JSON.encode($form.serializeArray()) is prob what you want
[02:35:47] <De|work> shame on me
[02:35:51] <mw__> Ok will try it in a moment
[02:36:09] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/4nsUX/ -> why does "new Date('2012','1','1') return the first of february of that year?
[02:36:55] <De|work> DarsVaeda, counting starts from 0
[02:37:10] <gnarf> DarsVaeda: for some reason unknown to us mere mortals - javascript date objects start month counting at 0
[02:37:10] <De|work> DarsVaeda, 0 jan 1 feb...
[02:37:28] <DarsVaeda> gnarf: holy what?
[02:37:49] <De|work> holy where?
[02:38:13] <DarsVaeda> gnarf: thanks
[02:38:48] <De|work> ok ok, wont trouble with my help...
[02:38:48] <juha_> holy potatoes!
[02:38:52] <gnarf> ?js date = new Date(); console.log( date.toString(), date.getMonth() );
[02:38:53] <bot-t> gnarf: "Tue Sep 27 2011 15:08:47 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)" 8
[02:39:01] <gnarf> see, september is 8
[02:39:06] <gnarf> we just count wrong
[02:39:37] <DarsVaeda> not really "wrong" but the only docu I found for Date() said Date(year, month, day)
[02:39:44] <DarsVaeda> so I put the actual month in
[02:40:13] <De|work> DarsVaeda, even w3schools says "getMonth() 	Returns the month (from 0-11)"
[02:40:31] <DarsVaeda> I tend to leave that site where it is ^^
[02:40:42] <courpse> Can you do example.com:XXX with $.get?
[02:41:08] <Hooloovoo> courpse: should work
[02:41:15] <courpse> I'd of thought so too, thanks.
[02:42:33] <De|work> DarsVaeda, do as you wish, just dont blame documents, if you haven't really searched
[02:43:15] <Ankabout> how can I load a function once a certain matched element is loaded?
[02:43:15] <FNTom> I wish AJAX would get a full reinvention that would allow cross domain requests safely
[02:43:18] <courpse> In his defense, the answer may be correct, but your source was w3schools?
[02:43:29] <courpse> FNTom, +1.
[02:43:31] <Ankabout> I have a bunch of photos that are loading, and I want the function to start as soon as the last photo is loaded
[02:44:12] <De|work> courpse, just the first one in google search results, I'm grown up enough, to be able filter any information avilable
[02:44:47] <De|work> FNTom, that's just for security
[02:45:06] <FNTom> De|work; I know because security is the fundemental issue of AJAX as of today
[02:45:12] <De|work> FNTom, I hope, IPv6 in future, will bring us more security in web field too...
[02:45:32] <FNTom> There are better ways to address it than blocking all non-oringal requested domains from AJAX requests
[02:45:55] <FNTom> But it would require a new overhaul / protocol ideally
[02:46:14] <courpse> Hooloovoo, Um, Nope, doesnt allow port.
[02:46:28] <De|work> global usage of IPv6 would allow that...
[02:46:34] <mw__> JSON.encode is an external function?
[02:46:34] <De|work> IPV4 deadend
[02:46:50] <Cork> mw__: its native to all farly modern browsers
[02:47:19] <Cork> ie7+, ff3+, chrome, opera 9(i think)
[02:47:35] <FNTom> De|work, How would IPv6 stop an AJAX request fetching facebook.com/account/, getting your delete key and deleting your account?
[02:48:05] <soee> hi, ow can i get access to first span with class X after img with class Y ?
[02:48:29] <mw__>         var formContent = JSON.encode($("form#newShipForm").serializeArray()); is it proper?
[02:48:47] <mw__> cause javascript seems to stop ;)
[02:49:02] <FNTom> If there was a new method supported by HTTPds such as AJAX alongside GET / POST etc in which browsers would signify if it was the domain requested by the user or a cross domain
[02:49:18] <FNTom> I mean, probably a hundred things to take into consideration, but at least it would be differentiated server side
[02:49:20] <Cork> soee: thats not entierly simple to do, it becomes farly costly do to
[02:50:05] <Cork> soee: $('img.my_class + span.my_second_class, img.my_class + * + img.my_class:first')
[02:50:24] <Cork> oh wait you need a filter more
[02:50:30] <Cork> soee: $('img.my_class + span.my_second_class, img.my_class + * + img.my_class:first').first()
[02:50:42] <soee> Cork: so complicated ?
[02:50:47] <Cork> yes
[02:50:55] <Cork> dom isn't meant for that kind of selection
[02:51:04] <Cork> or rather css isn't
[02:51:24] <courpse> So um, How can i connect to the same server on a different port with $.get or $.ajax?
[02:51:45] <Cork> soee: if your sure its on the same level (a sibling) it can be simplified a lot
[02:52:08] <soee> Cork: its for tooltip, span is always after image
[02:52:24] <Cork> soee: $('img.my_class').nextAll('span.my_second_class').eq(0)
[02:52:27] <styol> courpse: site.com:1234 possibly
[02:52:47] <courpse> styol, Doesnt work.
[02:53:17] <De|work> mw__, use JSON.stringify() instead of encode
[02:53:40] <courpse> $.get('example.com', function(data) { ... }); works fine, $.get('example.com:XXX', function(data) { ... }); fails.
[02:54:49] <Cork> courpse: yes, cross domain isn't allowed
[02:54:54] <De|work> courpse, same origin policy
[02:55:06] <courpse> Balls.
[02:55:19] <courpse> Then my only option is a iframe.
[02:55:19] <mw__> De|work it work for me
[02:55:25] <Cork> xxx.yyy.zzz:pppp everything causes different origins
[02:55:25] <mw__> but jquery throws an error
[02:55:30] <mw__> funny ;)
[02:55:39] <Cork> courpse: you won't be able to talk with the iframe content though
[02:55:49] <courpse> Hummf.
[02:55:50] <De|work> mw__, show your form in jsfiddle, try using JSON.stringify($("form").serializeArray()); again
[02:56:23] <courpse> I'm just playing with nodejs, and i want to run a client inside a existing webpage.
[02:56:29] <De|work> courpse, you can workaround that, with serverside script
[02:56:44] <courpse> Humnm.
[02:56:46] <courpse> Good point.
[02:56:57] * courpse writes a BNC for PHP.
[02:56:58] <courpse> lol
[02:57:02] <De|work> with a standart request of URL & port, serverside could curl that for you
[02:57:26] <courpse> Kinda taking out the good parts of nodejs by doing that thou.
[02:57:45] <FNTom> courpse, it's to prevent what I said earlier
[02:57:55] <courpse> FNTom, I fully understand that.
[02:58:00] <courpse> I thought :port might be allowed thou.
[02:58:16] <bjhaid> hi, i have this in my jquery script $(".select_sub:last sub ul li:eq(2)").remove();
[02:58:16] <bjhaid> but it seems different browsers interpret this differently, works in some version of firefox and does not work in others, any suggestions please
[02:58:19] <courpse> Which the guys here have already cleared up.
[02:58:31] <FNTom> Different port means different website unfortunately :P
[02:58:49] <courpse> Yeah, well, cross domain is usually what its called.
[02:58:53] <courpse> I took that literally.
[02:59:04] <De|work> courpse, this is same origin policy this time
[02:59:27] <courpse> Unsure what you mean.
[02:59:37] <De|work> cross domain is just a case of sop
[02:59:42] <courpse> Why would same origin be a problem?
[03:00:07] <Paveloosha_> Hi guys, I am using $.cookie('myCookie','cookieVal') to store a session cookie. But I can see cookie value is not removed when I am cloasing browser. Its comming again when I am oppening browser again. What are the possible causses?
[03:00:21] <FNTom> courpse; take cPanel for example. I have a site called fantastic.com which runs cPanel (fantastic.com:2072)
[03:00:30] <FNTom> Now anybody with an account on that server can login @ fantastic:2072
[03:00:43] <FNTom> So on my site, I could have an AJAX request to cPanel on my same domain
[03:01:02] <FNTom> And any customer of that server who hits my page, the AJAX request would be done under their login (if they were currently logged in)
[03:01:35] <FNTom> So although it's the same domain, the AJAX request is accessing their account
[03:01:46] <FNTom> Which is baaaaad
[03:02:30] <FNTom> Because cPanel doesn't care what hostname you used to access port 2072. It's the same website for everybody.
[03:03:32] <james13433> after appending some html with ajax, I noticed the click function wasnt working, I changed it to .live("click" but this has made no difference. should this be working? http://pastebin.com/y6A01R0x
[03:04:01] <De|work> james13433, just run event binding again, after retrieving ajax data
[03:04:15] <james13433> event binding?
[03:04:21] <james13433> whats that
[03:04:38] <FNTom> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/589238/jquery-how-can-i-rebind-this-event-after-a-ajax-callback
[03:04:49] <De|work> put your onclick stuff inside a function, call it on startup, and call it every time, you get ajax data
[03:04:54] <holodoc> Or use live (http://api.jquery.com/live/)
[03:05:01] <blackspotwiggins> live should work
[03:05:11] <blackspotwiggins> De|work, if you do that you bind the same event over and over
[03:05:42] <james13433> thats my point, im using live()
[03:05:50] <sunmao> Hi! Is it possible to get an element's width in float? Becuase jquery element.width always returns with rounded value but I need sg like this: 259.2 px ?
[03:05:57] <De|work> blackspotwiggins, if there is a new content inside DOM, and event is bind to "old" DOM element, event will not work, won't it?
[03:06:20] <blackspotwiggins> De|work, if you always clean out the dom after ajax, sure
[03:06:25] <blackspotwiggins> but what's the point of ajax in that case
[03:07:34] <xp_prg> wow I am having the hardest time finding an easy way to do websockets
[03:07:37] <james13433> De|work, what you say wont work because my on click, shouldnt run when I get ajax data
[03:07:44] <xp_prg> the client side appears to be easier than the server side
[03:07:46] <Paveloosha_> Hello guys, please help.. I am stucked.. I am using $.cookie('myCookie','cookieVal') to store a session cookie. But I can see cookie value is not removed when I am cloasing browser. Its comming again when I am oppening browser again. What are the possible causses?
[03:07:50] <holodoc> sunmao: As far as I know all browsers round dimension values for the purpose of displaying elements. The only place you might see float values are the calculated values.
[03:07:51] <xp_prg> anyone have recommendations for the server side?
[03:08:01] <blackspotwiggins> Paveloosha_, it's not a session cookie?
[03:08:32] * De|work out
[03:08:38] <holodoc> sunmao: Just curious. Why would you want float values?
[03:09:28] <Paveloosha_> <blackspotwiggins>, but https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie is saying that!
[03:09:32] <james13433> jQuery('.less-more').toggle(function(){ works after the ajax import but  jQuery('.less-more').live('click', function(){ or jQuery('.less-more').click(function, wont.
[03:09:41] <bjhaid> please what is wrong with this line of code: $(".select_sub:last sub ul li:eq(2)").remove();
[03:10:42] <sunmao> holdoc I have a table and this table's tds are calculated values (it means not integers) and I would liek to recrate this table via JS but when I am getting the width I got back rounded values
[03:11:07] <sunmao> holodoc: sorry I misstyped your name.. :)
[03:12:25] <sunmao> holodoc: So If I go to the firebug and check the 'real' width and I pass punctually for the jquery's width method it's working
[03:12:43] <holodoc> sunmao: As I already said as far as I know all browser round their elements dimensions because you can't actually split a pixel.
[03:13:23] <james13433> must be an error in my code because, it .live('click' wont work even before I have imported the ajax, can anyone see anything wrong with it http://pastebin.com/y6A01R0x?
[03:13:24] <holodoc> sunmao: The only place where you might see floats is if you open Developer Tools in Chrome etc. But those are always rounded before used for layout.
[03:13:27] <sunmao> hmm then I need to find out who the rounding tecnique is working
[03:13:41] <sunmao> holodoc: I got it
[03:14:52] <holodoc> sunmao: If you are having trouble with dividing table into equal parts (division leftover) just use numbers which leave no residue.
[03:15:01] <sunmao> holodoc: but it's rounded quite intresting way..
[03:15:22] <holodoc> sunmao: Like if you have three columns use a number which leaves no reside after dividing with 3.
[03:15:38] <Paveloosha_> hi <blackspotwiggins>, any light?
[03:15:43] <sunmao> ok thank you
[03:15:47] <sunmao> now i go to eat
[03:15:47] <Paveloosha_> for me..
[03:15:48] <sunmao> cu
[03:16:00] <holodoc> Qapla'!
[03:16:14] <blackspotwiggins> no idea
[03:16:18] <blackspotwiggins> i dont manually set cookies
[03:16:29] <blackspotwiggins> but obviously the plugin is not working, if the cookie persists
[03:16:52] <coldhead> do you have a live demo and can you link to your code please Paveloosha_
[03:17:21] <Travis-42> I have two different functions bound to click for a single link, with e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation() in both, yet both get triggered. Any idea why and how to fix this?
[03:18:00] <blackspotwiggins> stoppropagation works up the dom
[03:18:05] <blackspotwiggins> the handlers on the same event still fire
[03:18:21] <blackspotwiggins> ?stopImmediatePropagation @ Travis-42
[03:18:21] <bot-t> Travis-42, event.stopImmediatePropagation(): Keeps the rest of the handlers from being executed. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[03:18:22] <coldhead> and preventDefault is for defaults, not for stuff you;ve set up
[03:18:30] <Paveloosha_> <coldhead>, http://www.artistictile.net/store/media/new-images-2012/article_accordian.js
[03:19:03] <Travis-42> blackspotwiggins, Ah thanks, I misunderstood!
[03:19:04] <james13433> I dont get it, works fine in jsfiddle, but not on my site, and has no errors :(
[03:19:16] <troubleman> muzone: what did you use to create those tracks at http://soundcloud.com/user4438122 ?
[03:19:16] <Travis-42> coldhead, I realize, I was just trying everything :-)
[03:19:45] <coldhead> Travis-42: when you can get blackspotwiggins's expertise everything is going to be okay
[03:20:50] <troubleman> i mean
[03:20:59] <coldhead> Paveloosha_: my guess is maybe passing a Number to cookie() is confusing it
[03:21:09] <troubleman> im not saying i could do something even remotely similar even if i had your tools, just curious
[03:21:20] <coldhead> try num.toString() instead of just num
[03:21:57] <Paveloosha_> <coldhead>, ok let me try..
[03:22:14] <blackspotwiggins> ""+num is easier
[03:22:38] <bjhaid> please how do i make this line of code work across browsers
[03:22:39] <bjhaid> $(".select_sub:last sub ul li:eq(2)").remove();
[03:23:23] <Paveloosha_> <blackspotwiggins>, okay, I am checking both..
[03:24:13] <coldhead> blackspotwiggins: that's less readable :P
[03:24:34] <coldhead> you probably use $(fn) instead of $(document).ready(fn)
[03:24:43] <coldhead> you monster
[03:24:47] <blackspotwiggins> yeah i do
[03:24:55] * coldhead crosses himself
[03:25:01] <blackspotwiggins> there is no optimizing like hyperoptimizing
[03:25:07] <coldhead> lol
[03:28:17] <james13433> Anybody care to help be debugg this? http://jsfiddle.net/R4a2m/
[03:28:38] <james13433> it should say woop when you click the "less-more" class
[03:28:59] <james13433> its a proble with the rest of html im pritty sure because if you have the ul thats in alone its fine.
[03:30:58] <amon293> can anybody help me with lightbox? isn't working and i don't know why. thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/CHvHu/
[03:32:49] <red> Something seems to override a .click function I bind to a button after a set time, how can I monitor the element for "change" and re-add my click event to it?
[03:34:44] <Bower^> red, if I were you I'd be more concerned about what this "something" is that is overriding your function and stop it there
[03:35:16] <red> bower^: this is a 3rd party module I'm hooking into, so I can't really fiddle with it's code least I want to do it again every update
[03:35:26] <Bower^> Ah fair point
[03:35:41] <holodoc> holodoc: Just testing something :)
[03:35:51] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, <blackspotwiggins>, not working :( .................. https://www.artistictile.net/store/index-2012-homepage.html .......try left menu
[03:35:51] <red> I get ur point too though, but in this case it's a simple click event to catch children elements ID's (its an add more fields button thingy)
[03:36:14] <red> I can console.log the input button
[03:36:23] <red> but attaching a click to it works if I click it during pageload
[03:36:45] <red> after a second or so it doesn't work any longer so I suspect there's something loading up via AJAX that pushes my .click away heh
[03:38:05] <Bower^> red, are you setting it within $(document).ready(function(){}) ?
[03:40:33] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, <blackspotwiggins>, it is not working.. is there another way to set cookie using jquery?
[03:40:46] * james13433 smashes head against the table repeatedly
[03:41:56] <james13433> live hover works fine, normal click works fine, but live click doesnt - !!!!!
[03:42:04] <holodoc> Why do you need jQuery for simple things like setting a ccokie? Use plain JavaScript instead.
[03:42:19] <holodoc> document.cookie
[03:43:03] <Anticom> how did appending a new tr with a set of td's at the end of a table work again?
[03:43:11] <Anticom> selecting tbody and simply using .append() ??
[03:43:18] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias @ Anticom
[03:43:18] <bot-t> Anticom, Try It And See
[03:43:51] <james13433> does it matter if .live('click', function(){ is in the head or in a script in the body?
[03:44:09] <blackspotwiggins> no
[03:44:24] <james13433> this is rediculous :(
[03:44:40] <Paveloosha> <holodoc>, okay.. trying
[03:45:03] <holodoc> james13433: Its does. You wont be able to attach the live event if the DOM element you are referring to isn't yet loaded.
[03:45:25] <holodoc> james13433: Do you have your event binding code wrapped around $(document).ready()
[03:45:32] <amon293> can anybody help me with lightbox? isn't working and i don't know why. thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/CHvHu/
[03:45:40] <james13433> holodoc I just have jQuery(function(){ ?
[03:45:59] <blackspotwiggins> holodoc, why not?
[03:46:03] <blackspotwiggins> thats the idea of live
[03:46:09] <james13433> holodoc I dont think that the problem, though because live hover works
[03:46:11] <blackspotwiggins> you dont have the elements ready yet
[03:46:49] <Anticom> alright, works just fine
[03:46:59] <james13433> black spot wiggins, how so?
[03:47:47] <persuewhatstrue> Hi all! I want to change my class, this is my code:
[03:47:48] <persuewhatstrue> 			$('#tt1').mouseover( function() {
[03:47:48] <persuewhatstrue> 				$(this).removeClass('bigmenu');
[03:47:48] <persuewhatstrue> 				$(this).addClass('bigmenu_on');
[03:47:49] <persuewhatstrue> 			});
[03:47:54] <persuewhatstrue> it doesnt work
[03:48:05] <james13433> blackspotwiggins, how so?
[03:49:32] <persuewhatstrue> hey guys, help me please
[03:49:36] <persuewhatstrue> ^
[03:49:46] <blackspotwiggins> james13433, how so what?
[03:50:13] <james13433> how dont I have them ready yet?
[03:50:24] <holodoc> blackspotwiggins: Funny enough it seems that it really doesn't matter with live.
[03:50:44] <blackspotwiggins> holodoc, noe-schett sherlocke
[03:50:54] <blackspotwiggins> james13433, i wasnt talking to you
[03:51:03] <Bower^> persuewhatstrue, paste into pastebin or something in future. $(lol).attr('class', 'bigmenu_on'); should do it
[03:51:10] <james13433> blackspotwiggins ahh ok.
[03:51:24] <holodoc> blackspotwiggins: No need to be a smartass.
[03:52:15] <james13433> Ive make a jsfiddle, with as little elements as I ould to replicate the problem i'm having
[03:52:20] <james13433> http://jsfiddle.net/R4a2m/1/
[03:52:33] <james13433> if you remove the javasctipt within the html bit it works fine.
[03:52:51] <james13433> but i need it inline, liek that on my site.
[03:52:57] <red> bower^: yeah I am
[03:53:15] <red> when the document is ready, my .click works briefly before some stuff is loaded dynamicly
[03:53:27] <Bower^> red, I see. that's pretty weird
[03:53:34] <Bower^> are you sure that's normal behaviour
[03:53:55] <Bower^> I mean something coming in and attaching .click functions to your elements?
[03:54:28] <blackspotwiggins> james13433, try wrapping it in $(function() { })
[03:55:05] <coldhead> that;s your solution to everything!!
[03:55:24] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, it is
[03:55:25] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[03:55:33] <james13433> blackspotwiggings, same problem http://jsfiddle.net/R4a2m/2/
[03:55:52] <coldhead> Paveloosha: find a demo for that cookie plugin and see if it's broken there as well
[03:55:53] <blackspotwiggins> you didnt change it
[03:56:11] <james13433> You want me to wrap it in that twice?
[03:56:15] <james13433> I dont understand.
[03:56:16] <blackspotwiggins> its not wrapped..
[03:56:18] <coldhead> Paveloosha: it generally works, i really think you're doing it wrong somehow
[03:56:58] <james13433> blackspotwiggings, that bottom js bit isnt the problem, that runs fine when the top bit isnt there.
[03:57:03] <james13433> http://jsfiddle.net/R4a2m/4/
[03:57:22] <james13433> http://jsfiddle.net/R4a2m/5/
[03:57:46] <blackspotwiggins> james13433, dont put js inline
[03:57:48] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, hmmm..may be.. but it is setting cookie fine but I cant see anything wrong in my code.. it suppos to be removed after closing browser.
[03:57:55] <blackspotwiggins> if you use the bottom js
[03:58:02] <james13433> I just put that there to show it will work if you removew the <script> bit from the html
[03:58:05] <blackspotwiggins> with the thing i told you to use
[03:58:07] <blackspotwiggins> it will work
[03:58:35] <james13433> blackspotwiggins, I need it inline
[03:58:54] <blackspotwiggins> no you dont
[03:58:56] <james13433> because im using php to get the image url and stuff
[03:59:01] <Anticom> that one won't work :/ http://jsfiddle.net/VJRUp/
[03:59:04] <james13433> jQuery(this).find("img").attr("src","<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/viewmore.gif');?>");
[03:59:54] <Anticom> -.- okay got it already
[03:59:57] <Anticom> forgott the quotes :D
[04:00:26] <james13433> having it inline shouldnt change anything anyways, should it?
[04:00:48] <blackspotwiggins> obviously it does?
[04:01:07] <james13433> yerp but why,
[04:01:47] <james13433> if it never worked with hover, I would probably give up, but it does so im adament it should work with click also
[04:01:56] <blackspotwiggins> because bad practice demons hate you. that's why.
[04:02:12] <coldhead> Paveloosha: man i don't know, maybe it's your browser? it works for me usually
[04:03:16] <jpolan> hello, is there a jquery/javascript hack to get the URL source from an iframe once a user has left the original URL?
[04:04:24] <james13433> Guess Ill have to give up
[04:05:57] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, I am checking it again in all browsers..
[04:06:20] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, it is really frastrating..
[04:06:28] <Paveloosha> :(
[04:06:38] <coldhead> it is broken in all browsers?
[04:06:54] <coldhead> you need to try someone else's demo in all browsers
[04:07:12] <coldhead> if it's still broken then there must be a bug in the plugin
[04:07:20] <coldhead> otherwise you;re doing it wrong somehow
[04:08:26] <sunmao> holodoc: I've found it... :)
[04:09:22] <coldhead> Paveloosha: http://jsfiddle.net/KGj6r/
[04:09:22] <zolek> I have a problem, here is my code: http://wklej.eu/index.php?id=3f32f6225f and I think its with asynchronous requests, could anyone please guide me (its rather simple piece of code :) )
[04:10:26] <coldhead>  Paveloosha: that is setting a session only cookie for me...
[04:14:00] <eshlox> hi, html <div id="1"></div><div id="2"></div><div id="3"></div><div id="n"></div>, i want hide() all divs where id is greater than n, now i have for loop and i checking every div if is :checked, but maybe is better way?
[04:14:01] <james13433> blackspotwiggins, so i put it in its own js file, but now after the html is imported with ajax, it wont work :(
[04:17:42] <zolek> ok, so: how can I make an ajax call that will return data true/false that is bound to the .submit() handler (send form or not)
[04:17:55] <blackspotwiggins> zolek, ajax is async
[04:18:04] <blackspotwiggins> so you dont get the response immediately
[04:18:08] <truce> hello i have a question about sortables
[04:18:10] <zolek> i tried 'async: false'
[04:18:15] <blackspotwiggins> thats bad
[04:18:18] <truce> how do i animate the incoming element
[04:18:32] <zolek> blackspotwiggins, so what do you suggest?
[04:18:40] <truce> i am not quite sure how to animate this
[04:18:47] <truce> i mean explain this
[04:18:47] <blackspotwiggins> let the backend handle it?
[04:19:10] <blackspotwiggins> just submit the form and let the server determine what to do with the data
[04:19:20] <truce> when an elment is removed from its position the successive element takes its position
[04:19:32] <truce> I need this action to be smooth
[04:19:39] <zolek> well, that I can do but i'd like the page not to reload
[04:19:58] <zolek> that it would be just uber cool
[04:20:17] <blackspotwiggins> you can submit your form via ajax
[04:20:28] <blackspotwiggins> but if you are only doing it for the "cool" factor, please stop
[04:21:14] <truce> anyone? I just cant find how to animate the movement of the element that takes the empty position
[04:21:25] <zolek> blackspotwiggins, I'm kidding, but that would be pretty functional - want to fill a survey, log in first, then You can send the post data
[04:22:39] <truce> zolek : can you help me?
[04:23:24] <blackspotwiggins> zolek, another option would be to do the request, cancel the initial submit
[04:23:33] <blackspotwiggins> if the request is successful, redo the submit
[04:24:44] <b0red> is there a plugin which extracts gzip http response in jquery?
[04:25:02] <blackspotwiggins> the browser does it for you
[04:25:15] <truce> blackspotwiggins do you have any idea how to animate the movement of the element that takes the empty position in jquery sortables?
[04:25:24] <b0red> really?  do i still need to instruct it to do so?
[04:25:31] <blackspotwiggins> truce, no idea
[04:25:44] <blackspotwiggins> b0red, most of the web uses gzip. you dont have to do anything manually
[04:25:56] <truce> any guess how i could accomplish that!!
[04:26:19] <blackspotwiggins> truce, i think animate() would work?
[04:26:45] <truce> well i would need to hook into the sortables
[04:27:04] <truce> and sortables ui would only return the element that is being sorted
[04:27:17] <truce> not the element that will take its initial place
[04:28:55] <truce> blackspotwiggins should i explain what actually i am talking about. i just cant find any solution
[04:29:02] <Paveloosha> <coldhead>, can you check your code in FF and show me your code?
[04:29:19] <blackspotwiggins> truce, not really. as i said, i dont know about sortable
[04:29:30] <truce> okay
[04:29:32] <blackspotwiggins> but you can use your intuition and docs to get it working, i think
[04:31:48] <JamesTaylor> hi all, am i right in thinking that there is a "jquery autocomplete" and a "jqueryUI autocomplete" ?
[04:32:46] <adrianp> JamesTaylor: see docs.jquery.com/plugins/autocomplete
[04:34:12] <JamesTaylor> adrianp thanks but is this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ differnet from docs.jquery.com/plugins/autocomplete
[04:34:37] <Paveloosha> <coldhead> , it is not working in FF only :(
[04:34:54] <truce> anyone?? i neeed some help with sortables
[04:35:13] <JamesTaylor> i think i'm trying to apply a .result function for a jquery autocomplete to a jqueryUI autocompelte as it's kicking back a "result is not a function" error
[04:35:16] <troubleman> Do I still need hoverIntent or does jQuery / jQuery UI now have something similar? hoverIntent - http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html - works like (and was derived from) jQuery's built-in hover. However, instead of immediately calling the onMouseOver function, it waits until the user's mouse slows down enough before making the call.
[04:41:29] <troubleman> wait let me rephrase
[04:41:33] <troubleman> ajpiano: Why hasn't jQuery made .hoverIntent() part of its own .hover()?
[04:41:56] <mwk_> am based in cambridge (uk).  does anyone know of a good, local user interface + jquery shop?
[04:42:08] <troubleman> For those who don't know, .hoverIntent() works like (and was derived from) jQuery's .hover(), but instead of immediately calling the onMouseOver function, it waits until the user's mouse slows down enough before making the call. Very important for usability, according to the world's foremost usability experts: http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708076.htm
[04:42:30] <troubleman> mwk_: you need a good interface design? i can do that for you
[04:43:18] <mwk_> do you have a website? portfolio? etc.?  i'll take a peek
[04:43:30] <troubleman> sure
[04:44:10] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this.. im getting a error on (line 110) http://pastebin.com/6Upxka12 i can pm site.. : )
[04:45:15] <mwk_> care to share the url? :-)
[04:45:17] <bjhaid> hi
[04:45:25] <bjhaid> my code works with firebug installed
[04:45:34] <bjhaid> and doesnt work on browser without firebug installed
[04:45:39] <bjhaid> any reason why this occurs?
[04:45:43] <FNTom> Do you have any console.log calls?
[04:45:56] <bjhaid> FNTom: yes
[04:46:04] <FNTom> Remove them, some browsers don't like them
[04:46:14] <FNTom> They're only for testing values while developing
[04:46:29] <troubleman> mwk_: please check your private messages
[04:47:28] <bjhaid> FNTom: they work on some pages in browser without firebug and dont work on some pages, with the code pointing to the same elements in these different pages
[04:48:19] <youngin_> mwk_: i can vouch for troubleman
[04:48:31] <youngin_> mwk_: hes the best designer in this place in my opinion..
[04:49:11] <FNTom> bjhaid; trust me. Remove them if you're not using them.
[04:50:00] <mwk_> thanks, youngin :-)
[04:50:55] <uchuff> mwk_: no idea if theyare the sort of outfit for what you want but these guys have done some lovely looking work for clients of ours http://www.dojodesignstudio.com/
[04:51:14] <uchuff> more creative than development though generally i think
[04:51:22] <bjhaid> FNTom: thanks
[04:51:22] <uchuff> also define local, they are in Glasgow!
[04:51:23] <bjhaid> worked
[04:51:38] <uchuff> which is kinda near Cambridge if you're talking globally
[04:54:18] <mwk_> thank you for the pointer, uchuff
[04:54:38] <mwk_> which clients did they work for? do you have a url for them?
[04:54:52] <uchuff> they have a portfolio on their site
[04:55:27] <mwk_> thanks
[04:55:39] <mwk_> the kind of thing I'm after is more web application than simple web site
[04:55:59] <mwk_> powered by a RESTful XML-based server
[04:56:29] <mwk_> difficult to diffentiate between web outfits with a little javascript/jquery widgetry and those that might be able to take on something bigger
[04:56:56] <e1ven> In Chrome, if I find a script with $('script').remove(), it removes the script from the page, and frees up the memory/connections.. In FF, it doesn't seem to. I'm loading a stupid-large number of scripts, so I need to be able to unload them.. Is there any better way to do this?
[04:57:30] <Cork> e1ven: script tags isn't ever meant to unload script
[04:57:49] <Cork> e1ven: scope them in objects and clear them
[04:58:24] <Cork> var my name space = { function_name: function() { /*does something*/ } }; space = null;
[04:58:52] <Cork> e1ven: the script tag has no real connection with the actual js except its the way to load it
[04:58:53] <TrueColors> http://screencast.com/t/7Ge4Kkxp - this is what happens when you view http://www2.beatbullying.org/firewalk/CMFixed/content.html on IE8
[04:58:56] <TrueColors> how can I fix it?
[04:59:22] <TrueColors> Note - IE Platform Preview doesn't show this issue ... the actual IE8 does.
[04:59:24] <e1ven> Cork- Sure, but is there a better way to load it, that I Can remove? I can't define the object directly, since it won't be created yet.
[04:59:38] <Cork> e1ven: i just gave you the way
[04:59:44] <Cork> put it in a variable
[05:00:00] <Cork> clear the variable to unload the code
[05:00:16] <e1ven> Right now I'm doing a document.createElement('script'), to load a dynamically created .js file.. The way you gave me lets me define the function directly in the variable, but I can't define the function AFTER page load, like I can with the script tag.
[05:00:34] <Cork> e1ven: or just scope it (function() {})();, then it will be thrown away when its not referenced
[05:00:52] <Cork> e1ven: sure you can
[05:01:04] <e1ven> Oh, cool. OK. I guess I missed that. Sorry.
[05:01:11] <Cork> e1ven: the point is to scope the code
[05:01:18] <red> $('input').attr('type','foo'));   --> Uncaught type property can't be changed
[05:01:24] <e1ven> Ah! You're saying define it in a variable IN the included script?
[05:01:26] <Cork> if you don't it all poluts the global scope and is much harder to clean up
[05:01:29] <red> "Can't be changed"?
[05:01:30] <uchuff> mwk_: yeah, good freelance/agency devs seem trickier to find than designers
[05:01:37] <Cork> e1ven: exactly
[05:01:49] <uchuff> shame as i'm always in the position to chuck some work peoples way
[05:02:02] <red> does that mean it CANNOT be changed in any way, or am I doing it wrong?
[05:02:11] <e1ven> Cork- That makes sense. I'll play with that.
[05:02:13] <e1ven> Thanks.
[05:04:30] <Cork> good luck
[05:04:35] <orl> Hi!
[05:04:49] <uchuff> mwk_: http://www.vsourz.com/ seem pretty sensible and are a bit more techy, they do integration type stuff from what I gather
[05:05:34] <TrueColors> Can anyone assist me with my issue? ... it's up there ^
[05:06:03] <orl> I would like to replace my .load() methods with $.ajax(), cause I need to get the xhr before the request is complete (in ordre to be able to abort it), but I cannot find any place where it's explained how to select a special container using .ajax() (like with .load(myurl + ' #container>*');
[05:07:03] <Cork> orl: success: functon(data) { target.html($(data).find('#container')); }
[05:07:16] <orl> Cork: thanks a lot!
[05:07:20] <Cork> np
[05:08:41] <Cork> TrueColors: i'm not completly sure, but i think its the old classical hasLayout
[05:08:53] <TrueColors> hasLayout?
[05:09:01] <Cork> TrueColors: set css zoom: 1; on the elements that missbehaves
[05:09:10] <Cork> ?g ie hasLayout @ TrueColors

[05:10:02] <TheCode> is there somethink to count the number of properties in an object?
[05:10:26] <dmarkey> Slightly off topic, I have a HTML string in json embedded i my HTML page. Needless to say the HTML page is having a mare. How should I escape the json?
[05:10:26] <Cork> you would have to loop over them
[05:10:38] <TheCode> why o why?
[05:10:51] <blackspotwiggins> ?mdc Object.keys @ TheCode
[05:10:52] <bot-t> TheCode, Object.keys - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns an array of all own enumerable properties found upon a given object, in the same order as that provided by a for-in loop (the difference being that a for-in loop enumerates properties in th... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[05:11:05] <TheCode> oh!
[05:11:15] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: but is that cross browser?
[05:11:17] <TheCode> looking good'
[05:11:19] * Cork checks
[05:11:21] <blackspotwiggins> all but IE
[05:11:26] <Cork> :)
[05:11:26] <blackspotwiggins> who cares about ie anyway
[05:11:31] <TheCode> I one Node.js, so I give a shit about IE
[05:11:34] <TheCode> :D
[05:11:37] <TheCode> yea
[05:12:20] <TheCode> I just don't get why MSFT is hell bent on making the lives of developers miserable
[05:12:30] <blackspotwiggins> ie10 is looking pretty sharp tho
[05:12:34] <krogant> hi, i have a line of jquery which works fine in ff, but is erroring in ie: if ($('input', $target).val().trim().length == 0){ ... where $target is a div containing an input. the error i get is: object doesn't s upport this property or method
[05:12:38] <blackspotwiggins> it's just their version adoption rate is abysmal
[05:12:50] <mwk_> uchuff: thanks for the other pointer -- you have experience of vsourz?
[05:13:06] <TheCode> Personally I don't care about any ie at all
[05:13:09] <blackspotwiggins> krogant, ie doesnt have .trim() on strings
[05:13:15] <krogant> ahh that sucks
[05:13:16] <TheCode> piece of shit
[05:13:24] <krogant> blackspotwiggins: any workarounds?
[05:13:44] <Cork> replace should be able to do it
[05:13:49] <blackspotwiggins> ?$.trim @ krogant
[05:13:50] <bot-t> krogant, jQuery.trim() - Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[05:13:59] <blackspotwiggins> google mothafocka, do you use it?!
[05:14:00] <Cork> ah, forgot that one :D
[05:14:16] <mwk_> anyone in the south-east of england really
[05:14:26] <krogant> true, but replace would remove all whitespace throughout the string, not the start and end right
[05:14:29] <mwk_> i'm down in stevenage and london fairly regularly
[05:14:40] <james13433> How would I change this jQuery(".main .narrow-by-list a").live('click', function(e) {
[05:14:43] <Cork> krogant: no regex can match start and end
[05:14:49] <Cork> krogant: but theres a better option
[05:14:54] <mwk_> if anyone works for or has used a user interface design / web application development agency and can recommend them, ping me!
[05:14:59] * Cork points at blackspotwiggins's response
[05:15:12] <james13433> so that a click from an a inside the li.less-more div doesnt activate it
[05:15:27] <TheCode> var o = {a:2, b:3}; // o.keys is undefined!
[05:15:30] <TheCode> Firefox
[05:16:16] <blackspotwiggins> TheCode, Object.keys(o)
[05:16:27] <blackspotwiggins> notice the lack of prototype, for some reason
[05:16:46] <krogant> ahh $('#foo').val().trim() != $.trim($('#foo').val()) right
[05:17:39] <TheCode> Arrrrr, so it's a static method
[05:17:41] <TheCode> Thanks
[05:18:11] <james13433> anyone?
[05:21:44] <krogant> thanks blackspotwiggins
[05:22:01] <krogant> bit of a gotcha right there
[05:31:19] <orl> Cork: here is the .ajax() method I've been building
[05:31:21] <orl> http://pastebin.com/Pyc37WMh
[05:31:23] <orl> to replace
[05:31:40] <orl> $('#mainDiv').load(State.url + ' #mainDiv>*', function() {
[05:31:41] <orl> }
[05:32:16] <orl> But, it doesn't seem to work, actually, $(data).find('#mainDiv') is an object, but it looks like it's empty
[05:32:22] <orl> Is there something I've missed?
[05:33:08] <orl> (note, I've tried both with and without .html in .find('#mainDiv').html() )
[05:33:37] <b0red> how to print an object Document in jquery?
[05:33:54] <blackspotwiggins> window.print()
[05:33:56] <blackspotwiggins> all day long
[05:34:10] <jeffsmykil> anyone around?  http://jsfiddle.net/5Murk/
[05:34:39] <b0red> blackspotwiggins, this is only printing 'object Document'
[05:34:55] <b0red> blackspotwiggins, it's an xml document and i want to display it on screen
[05:36:00] <jeffsmykil> nm figured it out
[05:39:53] <e1ven> Cork- I changed it to run in a function, which I then declared as a null, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  FF slows down when I run it repeatly, but Chrome is OK. Do you think you could take a look with me?
[05:40:36] <red> how do I get this to work properly, it's basics but it's eluding me: http://jsfiddle.net/MDhW7/
[05:40:50] <red> usually it would be $("selector, selector2").. but when they are variables?
[05:41:02] <red> or do I combine the variables into a long string first?
[05:43:07] <Cork> e1ven: sounds like you have something that still reference the code
[05:43:14] <Cork> like a timer or object or something
[05:43:27] <Cork> until its released the code will stay alive
[05:44:58] <e1ven> in my new function, I'm registering an on click on links.. but that shouldn't keep the function itself alive‚Ä¶ I broke it out into a new function-    var = function() { blah bah}; j(); j = null;  I don't see how it COULD be referenced anywhere else?
[05:46:36] <red> no takers?:)
[05:46:37] <Cork> e1ven: donno can't tell without looking through the code, and i can't take time for that now
[05:47:03] <e1ven> Cork- OK. Thanks. I'll keep at it.
[05:47:03] <Cork> red: you need to combind the selectors
[05:47:13] <Cork> jquery only take one argument for selectors
[05:47:50] <Cork> red: jQuery(audio_field + ', ' + audio_url + ', ' + production + ', ' + link_body + ', ' + slot_state + ', ' + duration)
[05:48:06] <Cork> red: or structure your selectors better :)
[05:52:08] <TrueColors> How would you toggle a class name?
[05:52:33] <Cork> ?.toggleCass ¬° TrueColors
[05:52:34] <pachet> ?
[05:52:35] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".toggleCass ¬° TrueColors" in jQuery Docs.
[05:52:37] <Cork> ?.toggleCass @ TrueColors
[05:52:38] <bot-t> TrueColors, .toggleClass() - Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[05:53:12] <Cork> its simple sometimes :D
[05:53:24] <TrueColors> hmm...
[05:53:48] <TrueColors> well a the moment it's set up to actually change the class name to something else, for instance... modMinBtn turns into modMaxBtn
[05:54:17] <Cork> you would have to use two toggles or .addClass and .removeClass
[05:55:31] <red> cork: okay thanks
[05:56:48] <red> cork: ah still syntax error mh
[05:57:33] <Cork> syntax error?
[05:59:18] <Cork> TrueColors: i already gave you a link...
[05:59:21] <Cork> opps
[05:59:23] <red> ah sorry, typo :)
[05:59:26] <Cork> stuck in scroll up >_<
[05:59:28] <red> missing ' from last variable
[05:59:35] <Cork> TrueColors: sorry for that
[05:59:50] <Cork> ah
[06:00:51] <orl> Cork: I do not understand: when looking at data, it's OK, I get what I should, when alerting $(data).find('#mainDiv') or $(data).find('#mainDiv>*'), I can verify, that it's an object, but finally, when using $(data).find('#mainDiv').html(), I just get 'null', and cannot put the result in any object, finally. Probablly something I missed, but I just can't figure out what
[06:03:27] <KarateKip3> Hallow! I want to hide just 1 DIV out of 10. How to do that? Problem is that all DIVs become hidden. I want something like $"#blabla".this.hide(); but of course that doesn't work.
[06:03:57] <orl> $("blahblah").hide()
[06:04:03] <orl> doesn't it work?
[06:05:35] <angelkoilov> KarateKip3:  $('blabla').each(function(){$(this).hide();return false;});
[06:06:22] <KarateKip3> orl: no, doesn't work. I tried $("#blabla").hide() but that would unique require ID for every DIV.
[06:06:30] <KarateKip3> angelkoilov: will try, brb
[06:06:49] <pachet> KarateKip3: what is driving the div hiding action
[06:06:50] <quicksilver> KarateKip3: well how do you intend to choose which div to hide?
[06:06:54] <pachet> ^
[06:07:03] <quicksilver> KarateKip3: ( angelkoilov's suggestion will not help you )
[06:07:50] <KarateKip3> quicksilver: yes, angelkoilov's suggestion doesn't work
[06:07:55] <quicksilver> $('div:eq(4)').hide() will hide the fifth div on the page; http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ is full of all kinds of other ways to select things.
[06:09:13] <KarateKip3> quicksilver: but that requires jQuery to first produce a list of all available DIVs, because how else would jQuery know there are 10 DIVs in total?
[06:09:38] <pachet> if you exceed the number it loops to beginning
[06:10:10] <KarateKip3> pachet: oki, i will try that
[06:10:36] <pachet> my gut is telling me this isnt the simplest solution
[06:11:31] <KarateKip3> pachet: me too... :(
[06:11:39] <pachet> are you firing off an event ;[
[06:12:11] <quicksilver> KarateKip3: this is a waste of time.
[06:12:19] <quicksilver> KarateKip3: what do you actually want to do?
[06:12:30] <quicksilver> if you don't give us a proper description of what you want, then how will we help you?
[06:13:15] <quicksilver> it is very easy to hide one DIV. There are millions of possible ways of selecting which div. What do you want?
[06:14:21] <KarateKip3> quicksilver: what i want to do is this: there's a list of items, let's say 20 items. When you click 1 item, it should open up and show() what is inside. When I use show(), then all 20 items will open up.
[06:14:31] <KarateKip3> I want only 1 item to open up
[06:14:35] <pachet> $(this)
[06:14:38] <pachet> zzz
[06:14:48] <quicksilver> KarateKip3: this is very easy.
[06:15:09] <quicksilver> for example, if you click on an <a> and the item you want to show is the next <div>, then $(this).next('div').show();
[06:15:34] <KarateKip3> quicksilver: ok, i will try, thnx
[06:15:45] <KarateKip3> pachet: u2 thanx
[06:15:58] <quicksilver> KarateKip3: http://api.jquery.com/next/ and http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[06:16:18] <KarateKip3> oki, will read that too

[06:19:15] <blackspotwiggins> no
[06:19:37] <angelkoilov> KarateKip3:  why my code wont work ?
[06:20:17] <angelkoilov> quicksilver:  why my code wont work ? i havent tested it but seems like it will work
[06:21:12] <cypha> I'd like to make an "edit profile" link that will just make the <dt><dd> fields that are there editable (as an input box)

[06:21:44] <gavin_huang> Hi guys, if I write this $.when(ajax1, ajax2).fail(fn), then in my fail function, what's the quickest way to know which ajax has failed?
[06:22:18] <quicksilver> angelkoilov: your code was a strange way to do  $('blahblah:eq(0)').hide(); but the real problem was understanding what KarateKip3 actually wanted.
[06:23:07] <angelkoilov> its strange :) but should work
[06:24:56] <pachet> strange as in strangely pointless
[06:25:17] <blackspotwiggins> angelkoilov, it would not do what he wanted anyway
[06:25:47] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this.. im getting a error on (line 110) http://pastebin.com/6Upxka12 i can pm site.. : )
[06:25:49] <smftre> when closing a jquery dialog, does the dialog get deleted along with all dom elements of it, so when it's recreated, is it the only instance?
[06:26:06] <Ojje> Trying to make cross domain ajax request to .NET 4.0 server with jquery ajax post with jsonp. Got the error : text/html (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI) With this code: http://fixee.org/paste/0c2lbk0/#url=gi13huv
[06:26:31] <KarateKip3> quicksilver: yeah, i know i should describe the problem better before showing any code. But now it works perfectly with .next() !!! Thanx! Also still reading the documentation on next() cuz .next() is very useful stuff
[06:26:36] <cypha> is there a jquery function that can convert all <dd> to <input type="text" value=original_value_that_was_in_the_dd> ?
[06:26:49] <smftre> or should I be binding it to close and do the .html("") myself?
[06:27:11] <blackspotwiggins> cypha, why would there be a special function for that?
[06:27:13] <angelkoilov> blackspotwiggins: why not ? it will update only 1st element
[06:27:23] <blackspotwiggins> Ojje, you cant jsonp posts
[06:28:04] <blackspotwiggins> angelkoilov, so? he never said he wanted to hide the first one. he just said 1 of 10

[06:28:34] <angelkoilov> ok u win
[06:28:36] <Ojje> blackspotwiggins: Okey. So how can i make a cross domain json POST request then? :)

[06:29:12] <AliG1000> Hi - I'm using this slider:  http://blog.egorkhmelev.com/2009/11/jquery-slider-safari-style/   I can wrap a slider in a form, submit it and get the slider values in the url as a GET, but, how do I do update a database via ajax?  I'm a bit lost getting the value of the slider.  E.g. should I be using a mouseup event to trigger the ajax, or something else
[06:29:20] <cypha> blackspotwiggins, .click(function(){$(#dd_field).convert_tag({input}) ?
[06:29:48] <cypha> what would "convert_tag" be?
[06:29:55] <blackspotwiggins> cypha, why do you assume that jquery lib has specific functions YOU need
[06:30:03] <blackspotwiggins> srsly, do you expect it magically poops out gold too?
[06:30:23] <pachet> ?.poopgold()
[06:30:25] <TrueColors> Magical poop!
[06:30:25] <bot-t> pachet, popurlsÆ | archive | issue 08-12-30 - http://archive.popurls.com/081230/
[06:30:34] <cypha> blackspotwiggins, so just javascript then?
[06:30:45] <blackspotwiggins> so just do it manually, ffs
[06:35:22] <Ankabout> I get "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined", but only at the end of the loop
[06:35:27] <AliG1000> is there a way to filter out quit and join messages on IRC? they're mostly irrelevant anyway
[06:38:32] <pachet> AliG1000: http://i.clintecker.com/disable-irc-msgs.html
[06:41:00] <AliG1000> pachet: thank you - am using the webchat version - IRC menu > Options > check Hide JOINS/PARTS/QUITS worked :)
[06:42:17] <TrueColors> Cork, I've created this: http://jsfiddle.net/jpDFe/ but if you notice, when you open one module... the others do not close - I'm wanting to close any open modules when a new one opens... is it possible to do this?
[06:47:32] <TrueColors_> Cork, don't worry about that - the user should have a *choice* on how many they have open
[06:47:49] <TrueColors_> The other issue, is when you keep clicking the same modules... how can I prevent them from queueing up ?
[06:49:44] <orl> OK, well, after several attempts, I definitely can't figure it out $('#container').load(url + ' #container>*') is not equivalent to $.ajax(url: url, success: function(data){ $('container').html($(data).find('container'))})
[06:49:58] <jeffsmykil> can i search an object for a certain value?
[06:49:59] <orl> I guess it's a matter of "non-concordant" objects (sorry for my english)
[06:52:33] <Ankabout> Can anyone see why I get an error at the end of the loop?  - http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/SS8M8/1/
[06:57:31] <jeffsmykil> do you have to define an end for an animation
[06:57:36] <jeffsmykil> i dont think you do
[06:58:55] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: um, its possible to do Infinity animations
[06:59:03] <gnarf> but its reliant on a custom step function
[06:59:13] <gnarf> afaik you need to define the end result
[06:59:25] <cypha> can I jquery'ize this so I can use selectors and whatnot, allowing me to easily re-use the code--> http://tycoontalk.freelancer.com/javascript-forum/71713-changing-a-tag-one-element-another.html#post327898
[06:59:30] <ignotus> hi, I want a text input field to loose the focus, how can I do that?
[06:59:38] <jeffsmykil> gnarf can i search an object for a certain value?
[06:59:46] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: meaning?
[06:59:48] <jeffsmykil> ignotus: blur
[06:59:51] <ignotus> jeffsmykil: thanks!
[07:00:06] <quicksilver> Ankabout: looks like a jquery bug to me, not sure
[07:00:24] <Ankabout> quicksilver, ah ok thanks
[07:00:28] <jeffsmykil> i need to find the object with a certain value ln it and change a value of a different property in it
[07:00:38] <ignotus> jeffsmykil: ah, that seems like it is only an event, I want the cursor not to be active on the input field anymore
[07:01:47] <ignotus> jeffsmykil: oh my bad sorry, it is working!
[07:01:49] <ignotus> thanks:)
[07:02:15] <cody--> is there a callback for the .css method
[07:02:37] <jeffsmykil> gnarf:  ^^^ did that make sense?
[07:02:44] <TrueColors> Ankaboutcody-- no ...
[07:02:47] <TrueColors> oops
[07:02:47] <ignotus> cody--: the effect of that call is instant, so you don't need one
[07:02:51] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: not really
[07:02:54] <KarateKip3> another very simple issue. I want to hide all DIVs that have a certain class name when document is ready. So I write this: $(".blah").hide(); alert ("test"); which doesn't work in my production environment but does work in the try-it editor of w3schools. Strange thing is that the alert does work perfectly even when the DIVs are not hidden. What am I overlooking?
[07:03:08] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: "find the object" - where?
[07:03:22] <AliG1000> Hi - I'm using this slider:  http://blog.egorkhmelev.com/2009/11/jquery-slider-safari-style/   I can wrap a slider in a form, submit it and get the slider values in the url as a GET, but, how do I do update a database via ajax?  I'm a bit lost getting the value of the slider.  E.g. should I be using a mouseup event to trigger the ajax, or something else?
[07:03:28] <gnarf> do you have an array of objects - an object containing other objects??
[07:03:48] <gnarf> "with a certain value" - is this value a specific property on the object?
[07:04:00] <pachet> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/9csmg/
[07:04:02] <cody--> ah ok
[07:04:03] <cody--> thanks
[07:04:15] <jeffsmykil> i have objects contained within another object
[07:05:30] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: then pachet just demo'ed a good working example for you
[07:05:31] <jeffsmykil> pachet: Im guessing this is a fairly bad way to do things as for as processor goes?
[07:05:39] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with this.. im getting a error on (line 110) http://pastebin.com/6Upxka12 i can pm site.. : )
[07:05:50] <pachet> depends on what kind of objects you're iterating ;o
[07:06:04] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[07:06:42] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: there is no other way - you iterate a list of some sort, be it properties on an object, or keys in an array
[07:07:03] <gnarf> it should be pretty fast for any object to iterate its keys
[07:07:04] <jeffsmykil> yeah the keys on in an array makes my brain hurt
[07:07:29] <jeffsmykil> its a confusing example
[07:07:32] <jeffsmykil> mine that is
[07:07:36] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: perhaps you should find another way to identify your object
[07:07:46] <TrueColors> http://jsfiddle.net/jpDFe/ when you click multiple times on a module title, it queues up the animations... when you multiple clicks, I only want it to happen when the current animation is complete on that module...
[07:07:48] <TrueColors> is it possible to do this
[07:07:56] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: how could I go about doing that?
[07:08:12] <gnarf> TrueColors: .is( ":animated" )
[07:08:55] <gnarf> TrueColors: http://jsfiddle.net/jpDFe/4/
[07:09:23] <TrueColors> perfect!
[07:10:49] <krater> Anyone here use clueTip plugin?
[07:13:10] <jeffsmykil> gnarf may I show you my code privately?
[07:13:37] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: you might want to look to pachet, I'm quite busy with my own shit atm
[07:13:43] <jeffsmykil> kk thanks
[07:14:37] <jeffsmykil> pachet: you super bogged down?
[07:16:17] <NickASloan> $.get sends the username and password that I'm already authenticated with for basic auth, but $.ajax does not
[07:16:27] <NickASloan> is there any way to make ajax replicate $.get?
[07:17:44] <ignotus> hi, I .detach()'d all of the <tr> elements of a table, did some work on them, how can I reattach them into the table?
[07:17:55] <adrianp> NickASloan: your $.ajax request should pickup the session/cookie unless you are crossing domains
[07:18:21] <NickASloan> adrianp: I'm talking HTTP basic auth
[07:18:29] <NickASloan> not cookies
[07:18:56] <Hooloovoo> ignotus: store the jquery elements in a var and use append later.
[07:19:35] <ignotus> Hooloovoo: thanks
[07:20:43] <adrianp> NickASloan: base64_encode the user:pass and send it with header
[07:20:51] <adrianp> i guess lol
[07:21:04] <NickASloan> ugh
[07:21:54] <jmotta> I'm getting a lot of "node is undefined data.parent = node.parentNode" in my js code, apparently it is something related to my ajax functions or something like that .. does someone know what could be causing it?
[07:21:58] <adrianp> you can probably grab that header with php and pass it through to your JS
[07:22:20] <pachet> jeffsmykil: unfortunately :[ qa meeting in 30 mins, running back and forth between offices like a frightened deer
[07:22:24] <jmotta> btw, the library throwing this error is jQuery.blockUI.js
[07:29:04] <TrueColors> Well, the original issue on the website ... it's not the JS, it's the CSS... but the strange thing is, my css works fine.. but their css doesn't so I'll have to look further into it
[07:29:47] <Fox`> we need to develop something which will take the coordinates of a click on an image, then (programatically) split the image up into a grid and then find which cell that click falls into. has anyone done anything similar?
[07:38:38] <jjulian> hi I'm having an ajax call to a html page which holds some javascript variables. is it possible to retrieve that data? or to use selector for that html page?
[07:43:59] <jmotta> I'm getting a lot of "node is undefined data.parent = node.parentNode" in my js code, apparently it is something related to my ajax functions or something like that .. does someone know what could be causing it?
[07:44:01] <jmotta> btw, the library throwing this error is jQuery.blockUI.js
[07:51:29] <muspelhe> hello
[07:52:13] <muspelhe> do not tell how to send headers through jquery on server to another server?
[07:52:44] <muspelhe> for example header('Set-Cookie: cook1=asd; expires=Tue, 30-Mar-2010 19:19:16 GMT; path=/; domain=forum.antichat.ru');
[07:52:46] <gnarf> jmotta: are you trying to $( this ) in an ajax callback?
[07:53:30] <jmotta> gnarf, no I'm not, why?
[07:54:23] <gnarf> jmotta: "this" isn't a node in an ajax callback, so it kinda made sense as a possible way to get an error like that
[07:54:35] <gnarf> have you looked at the execution stack in a debugger?
[07:54:50] <gnarf> trace it back to the last line of code in your code?
[07:58:08] <jmotta> yes, it points to an ajax call and then to an ajaxStart interceptor with my blockUI call .. apparently it is not being able to find my block div or my ajax call occurs so fast that something gets messed ...
[08:04:27] <ndee> is there a way to get the pixel count instead of the pixel count + meassurement from a $(element).css('paddingLeft') call? e.g.: I would need 15 instead of "15px"
[08:06:28] <reaby> when i set .attr('draggable','true') at start of code in firefox, all elements starts to work. for some reason if i set it in html it doesn't work. -> later on when i do .append(htmlcode) and try to do the same, set globally for all elements, it doesn't work for the newly created elements. I'm runnin out of ideas why it doesn't work.
[08:06:34] <orl> Hi again!
[08:11:39] <red> Can I somehow use a partial class name in removeClass() ? such as .removeClass('*-hilight')
[08:12:12] <amon293> i'm having trouble with fancybox. the video doesn't appear on my website neither it plays when fancybox is called. can anyone please help me? http://jsfiddle.net/5ahXy/ thanks!
[08:12:27] <orl> I'm trying to replace .load(url + ' #container>*') by a proper $.ajax() function. Cork gave me that line $.ajax(url: url, success: function(data)¬†{target.html($(data).find('#container'));}) but it didn't seem to work. I just merked that finally, data was not "full" if I alert it in success, I don't get the whole page.
[08:12:36] <orl> What could it come from?

[08:25:44] <james13433> Thanks anyways]
[08:26:02] <Ankabout> jomofcw so $('.my-element img').loaded(function(){   ?

[08:29:12] <quicksilver> jomofcw: what's wrong is that you haven't read the docs for clone.

[08:32:31] <quicksilver> if you are then maybe it's broken :(
[08:32:42] <webroasters> i guess this is more of a javascript question, than it is a jquery one. I'm trying to output a function that contains document.write("something");  However, I don't want that "something" to be outputted like that, I want it to be like a variable inside the code, instead. Do you guys follow me?
[08:33:19] <webroasters> what i want is the equivalent of PHP's =  return "something";
[08:33:32] <webroasters> not "echo "something"
[08:33:43] <webroasters> wait wait
[08:34:29] <Ankabout> ty jomofcw
[08:34:37] <nail_> <offtopic> Do you guys know about some database (but not GURLF) that would list "mobile" IP pools? (well something as accurate as possible)
[08:34:59] <webroasters> i explained that wrong: this is the line of code: <script type='text/javascript'>my_function();</script> , what I want is something where I don't need the script tags
[08:35:33] <webroasters> or where the script tags aren't showing in the html, just the output from the function
[08:35:59] <Eviltwin> webroasters: What?
[08:36:05] <koden> hey all I am trying to get a datepicker in my dialog box but for some reason it isn't creating the div. I know it isn't a z-index issue because the calendar isn't being created at all. Is there anything special I need to do to get datepicker to work in a dialog?
[08:36:48] <Eviltwin> koden: Try asking in #jqueryui, they specialize in the jQuery UI stuff
[08:37:06] <jomofcw> quicksilver nop 1.6.4. But anyway I just defer the binding and use a live instead.
[08:37:09] <koden> there is no such channel I dont think
[08:37:15] <webroasters> i have a function that outputs something, but I don't want the text/javascript tag to be there.  i don't know of a better way to ask that
[08:37:16] <koden> I tried to join and I was the only one
[08:38:10] <hlveheart> Hey guys ;}
[08:38:38] <orl> Cork: I think I've understood, actually #mainDiv contains only <p>, other divs, and so on, that's why I had to use .load(url + ' #mainDiv>*'), but when doing $(data).find('#mainDiv') it's just like it doesn't find any content (only children, I suppose)
[08:38:48] <Eviltwin> webroasters: A JavaScript function that outputs something?
[08:39:10] <webroasters> @Eviltwin: I'm sorry, it uses document.write();
[08:39:26] <Eviltwin> webroasters: So you don't want the script tag there in the source?
[08:39:42] <webroasters> basically, it's writing this: id="someclass-(variable)"
[08:39:46] <webroasters> correct
[08:40:08] <pachet> sounds like you should be using php
[08:40:09] <pachet> ;o
[08:40:14] <webroasters> i am,
[08:40:20] <webroasters> it's complicated to say the least
[08:40:46] <Eviltwin> webroasters: JavaScript cannot modify the source of the page, only the DOM
[08:41:25] <Eviltwin> And script tags are already invisible in the DOM
[08:41:40] <Eviltwin> Or at least when the DOM is rendered
[08:41:53] <webroasters> hmm, yeah, I need to find another way, I was afraid of that
[08:43:20] <Eviltwin> Why do you need a script tag to not be in the source?
[08:43:53] <webroasters> wait a sec
[08:44:08] <webroasters> I just realized the solution to my problem. Thanks guys. sorry for bother you!
[08:44:17] <webroasters> thanks Eviltwin
[08:44:18] <pachet> why cant you just have the script modify the id attribute of an element after load ;(
[08:44:20] <Eviltwin> Okay then...
[08:44:59] <webroasters> no, i wasn't being rude. something is dynamically added html to a form in wordpress, and I'm trying to create an increment through javascript
[08:45:07] <webroasters> however, I've realized how to do it.
[08:45:14] <webroasters> I just wasn't thinking on my feet
[08:45:23] <webroasters> *adding
[08:45:45] <webroasters> guys, i really do appreciate it
[08:48:30] <pachet> ;[
[08:48:32] <PeterB> Is there a more efficient selector I can use than this one? http://jsfiddle.net/6JpPk/3/
[08:49:27] <orl> If that interests someone, the good way to do this seems to be using .closest()
[08:50:13] <necromancer> can you pass JSON in the data property of an ajax request?
[08:50:32] <necromancer> like if i have JSON formed from php's json_encode(), can i just pass that object as the data of an ajax req?
[08:50:46] <dgx> Is there a way to make this feature: when a <option> is selected/clicked from a <select> element, another <select> appears. I am thinking with hidden on the 2nd element, what do you think?
[08:54:22] <ekneuss> Hi, small question regarding jquery: if I load some HTML inside i.e. tabs, or via .load(), I guess selectors applied on load will work on that newly loaded content?
[08:55:31] <Elephant> like if you load a <div id=lol> into an element with .html(), $('#lol) becomes available?
[08:56:54] <ekneuss> I have some global $(function () { .... $('.plop')... }); my question is: will it be re-run automatically if I load some <div class="plop"> via ajax ?
[08:57:03] <ekneuss> my guess is that it won't
[08:59:16] <pachet> ekneuss: if you have events bound explicitly, you have to rebind to dynamically loaded elements
[08:59:51] <ekneuss> is there a way to do that "automatically" ? i.e. rerun that main function
[09:00:15] <ekneuss> because all my main function does is binding stuff to elements with some ids/classes
[09:00:35] <ekneuss> or rather, what is the proper way to handle that, given that my content is sometimes loaded dynamically and sometimes not
[09:00:36] <Eviltwin> ekneuss: Can you make a jsFiddle example?
[09:00:54] <quicksilver> ekneuss: just give it a name and run it again.
[09:00:58] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[09:01:09] <quicksilver> although there is also .live() and .delegate() for this problem with dynamic content
[09:01:21] <ekneuss> mmh I'll take a look, thanks
[09:01:30] <quicksilver> I tend to go for 'give it a name and run it again', though, since I learnt to do it that way before live became core.
[09:16:56] <AdTaylor> I'm using qUnit for the first time and was wondering if there is a way I could test if a window has been opened (window.open)
[09:21:35] <CannedCorn> hey guys what is the best way to get autocomplete that happens with a trigger char using pills but allow plain text in-between the pills (not triggered by trigger-char)
[09:22:01] <CannedCorn> like google+'s +[personname] for example
[09:22:40] <Elephant> I am so confused by your question :(
[09:22:49] <jedimind> yeah ive read it 5 times now
[09:23:05] <jedimind> what are pills
[09:23:17] <enjoycrf> hey do u guys know how to switch from in app toolbar to global toolbar like mac
[09:23:44] <Elephant> enjoycrf: what toolbars exactly?
[09:23:49] <enjoycrf> the main one
[09:23:53] <enjoycrf> for the apps that open
[09:24:00] <enjoycrf> file .... help
[09:24:04] <jedimind> ... what does that have to do with jquery?
[09:24:08] <enjoycrf> i forgot where i set this
[09:24:14] <enjoycrf> shhh
[09:24:17] <CannedCorn> ok so, what i'm trying to do is create a text field
[09:24:30] <Elephant> lol, I was wondering when the web scripting part was going to come up.
[09:24:32] <CannedCorn> where you can type '@' to trigger an autocomplete
[09:24:40] <CannedCorn> and do it multiple times
[09:24:43] <jedimind> ah
[09:24:50] <enjoycrf> u guys
[09:24:51] <CannedCorn> each time you select a choice from the autocomplete, it turns into a pill
[09:25:01] <enjoycrf> u r bad person
[09:25:11] <jedimind> enjoycrf, stfu
[09:25:16] <CannedCorn> a la http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[09:25:24] <jedimind> CannedCorn, that would be a little tricky to explain
[09:25:41] <enjoycrf> ajpiano
[09:25:42] <CannedCorn> jedimind ok
[09:26:11] <enjoycrf> ajpiano: jedimind is herting me
[09:26:16] <jedimind> CannedCorn, this example is easy because the pills are all stacked at the beginning
[09:26:19] <jedimind> you dont have text inbetween
[09:26:33] <CannedCorn> agreed
[09:26:42] <jedimind> in this case, all its doing is adjusting the width of the input and placing the pill before it
[09:26:44] <jedimind> so it's not inside it
[09:26:59] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: stpo asking about generic computer help questions
[09:27:04] <jedimind> i would imagine you could do something similar where you're adding spaces inside your text input + absolutely positioning some pill ontop of it
[09:27:24] <enjoycrf> im googling it
[09:27:26] <jedimind> but that would get messy really quickly i would imagine
[09:27:29] <CannedCorn> this does it http://jsfiddle.net/UdUrk/
[09:27:36] <CannedCorn> but it doesn't turn them into pills
[09:27:38] <CannedCorn> hah
[09:28:32] <jedimind> yeah...
[09:28:41] <jedimind> i mean the other alternative would be to fake the whole input experience
[09:29:13] <CannedCorn> jedimind, how so?
[09:29:15] <jedimind> hide the input on focus, replace it with an element, as people type move the contents of the input into this element
[09:29:18] <quicksilver> nice little pills like that are slightly fiddly to get right.
[09:29:28] <jedimind> on keyup
[09:29:47] <quicksilver> and that implementation you pasted isn't perfect - it does strange spacing if you press arrow keys to move back between the pills
[09:30:13] <quicksilver> (I had never heard htem called pills before today is that their real name?)
[09:32:43] <CannedCorn> quicksilver yeah
[09:32:51] <CannedCorn> quicksilver what else would you call them? hah
[09:33:09] <quicksilver> I dunno, but pills is an awful thing to search for :)
[09:33:26] <enjoycrf> wait what
[09:33:30] <enjoycrf> what r pills
[09:33:56] <enjoycrf> what part r u guys calling pills?
[09:34:02] <sherl0ck> alright lookin for plugin to make adjustable sidebar? if you have ever used SQL Server Management Studio, something to resemble that layout? a sidebar on the left, and a main window on the right, with adjustable divider
[09:34:07] <quicksilver> tokenizing autocomplete seems like a better name
[09:34:31] <Ankabout> how do I force my function to wait 3 seconds before executing?
[09:34:49] <enjoycrf> sherlock ive built a dragger
[09:34:55] <enjoycrf> its prety easy
[09:35:12] <enjoycrf> what r pills?
[09:35:35] <sherl0ck> enjoycrf: yea i was thinkin usiung jquery ui resizable and some divs
[09:35:53] <enjoycrf> yeah thats all u need
[09:35:54] <sherl0ck> but i like standardized packaged soultions with jquery
[09:36:10] <enjoycrf> well someone has to build them right?
[09:36:25] <enjoycrf> so make one and put it up
[09:36:45] <jedimind> enjoycrf, its like uhmm when you use gmail, and you type in someone's email address, it creates a little black thing with their name and you can remove it
[09:36:47] <jedimind> that's a pill
[09:36:55] <jedimind> ( something [x])
[09:37:10] <Elephant> Ankabout: setTimeoute()?
[09:37:16] <Elephant> Ankabout: setTimeout()? even
[09:37:24] <enjoycrf> oh
[09:37:36] <enjoycrf> rnt those tabs
[09:37:49] <enjoycrf> or is that an adopted name already
[09:38:13] <enjoycrf> actually label might be a good name
[09:38:13] <Ankabout> Elephant, I tried that, but I guess I'm using it right? http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/SS8M8/10/
[09:39:05] <xec> Ankabout: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout
[09:39:34] <orl> I'm experiencing problem using several <audio> or <video> on somes pages and an AJAX navigation. See here: http://sebkhachott.net/spip/?rubrique41 (or more effective: http://sebkhachott.net/spip/?article30), and try to clic somewhere on the menu (that semi-circular thing)
[09:39:42] <jedimind> label is already something
[09:39:52] <Elephant> you would call it like this: setTimeout('animateColor(0)', 2000);
[09:40:03] <Elephant> but it looks like something else might be broken.
[09:40:16] <orl> I thought it would be fixed by writing proper $.ajax() methods and using abort(), but it doesn't, it's just like if it as waiting until the <video> is ready to open the new link
[09:45:36] <narkeeso> How can I achieve something like this - if (event && event) { do this; }
[09:45:50] <Ankabout> xec, checking it out
[09:46:32] <xec> Ankabout: i think Elephant is right, something else wrong too
[09:46:57] <Ankabout> xec, without the timeout the code works fine
[09:47:08] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/SS8M8/10/
[09:47:12] <zorph> the jqueryui docs for the 'tabs' item...says call tabs().find('.ui-tabs-nav.').sortable()...
[09:47:25] <zorph> but there IS NO .ui-tabs-nav generated by the tabs...weiird..
[09:47:27] <Ankabout> there's an error at the end of the loop, but I've been told maybe it's a jquery bug?
[09:47:50] <zorph> I would ask in jqueryui....but nobody's ever there...
[09:48:37] <pachet> narkeeso: $(foo).bind('click keyup', function(){...});
[09:49:00] <narkeeso> pachet: but what if it's on 2 different elements?
[09:49:32] <narkeeso> $(foo).bind('click') and $(bar).bind(keyup)
[09:49:59] <narkeeso> let's say those 2 must have fired before doing anything
[09:50:00] <xec> Ankabout: maybe you just can't use arguments in settimeout http://jsfiddle.net/SS8M8/15/
[09:50:34] <Ankabout> oh that works, thanks!
[09:50:42] <xec> Ankabout: or better, like this http://jsfiddle.net/SS8M8/16/
[09:50:56] <xec> so you dont need another named function
[09:53:35] <pachet> narkeeso: you could have the events bind/unbind each other, i guess
[10:02:20] <muszek> hi... I have a simple page. one image and $('#zoom img').height()... why does it return 0?

[10:05:36] <ajpiano> zorph: are you calling it after you instantiated tabs
[10:05:46] <zorph> yep
[10:06:06] <ajpiano> zorph: why does the demo work :p
[10:07:14] <zorph> I should just be able to call sortable() on the ul:first...that's the same element as the ui-tabs-nav...
[10:07:21] <jedimind> ajpiano, i miss you man
[10:07:21] <zorph> because my usage is way more complex...

[10:11:26] <narkeeso> pachet: sheesh, thanks for this
[10:11:41] <narkeeso> didn't think it would have to be so complicated for something seemingly simple
[10:11:53] <monk13> guess i could use innerText, though jquery's text() would do same. doh.
[10:11:59] <giskard22> Hi everyone. Can anyone here help with login issues at bugs.jqueryui.com? The reset password page always claims a new password has been emailed, and the email never arrives.
[10:12:15] <ajpiano> giskard22: oh goodness :/
[10:12:58] <ajpiano> and you just aren't getting an e-mail?
[10:13:22] <giskard22> yeah
[10:13:28] <giskard22> tried this a couple months ago too, never got the email
[10:13:36] <ajpiano> bummer
[10:13:47] <ajpiano> are you particularly averse to just making a new acct
[10:14:03] <gnarf> ajpiano: lolz
[10:14:04] <giskard22> well, not super-averse, but wanted to report a problem if it exists :-)
[10:14:25] <CannedCorn> so it seems like there are a lot of tokenized autocomplete plugins out there but none that allow text in between
[10:14:50] <ajpiano> giskard22: thanks :)
[10:15:39] <ajpiano> i can't find any user admin stuff though for me to play with
[10:15:42] <ajpiano> just ticket admin
[10:16:12] <pachet> narkeeso: yw, theres probably some other tricks you can do as far as storing a variable in .data, or something, to check states
[10:16:15] <giskard22> ajpiano: thanks
[10:17:12] <iroxoru> I just created a page to mirror something done with flash
[10:17:20] <iroxoru> http://www.pendaslaw.com/blank11.php
[10:17:31] <iroxoru> wondering does it fade in right for other people?
[10:17:48] <iroxoru> some browsers seem to load all the content then start the fading
[10:17:56] <iroxoru> so it kinda ruins the effect
[10:21:29] <Ojje> If i choose xml-format for my jquery ajax POST requests. Should it work cross domain if there is a crossdomain.xml on the server?
[10:21:53] <jedimind> it _should_
[10:22:57] <Ojje> Any known issues?
[10:26:13] <Ojje> If i choose jsonp i cant make POST. I could use cors plugin but that would make me limited to FF 3.5+, IE8+, Safari 4+
[10:27:26] <speyburn> hi guys! im having a bit of trouble with the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/py5Mt/ problem is that i would like to show only the next "dlinfo" div thats after the "feedblock" and not everyone
[10:28:03] <speyburn> now it shows every feedblock, i was wondering if i could do this without having to use unique div id's or something like that
[10:28:39] <speyburn> im sorry, i mean it shows every "dlinfo" block when i click "eventhl"
[10:28:57] <iroxoru> anyone here use the lavalamp jquery plugin/effect?
[10:30:05] <darren_p> Hi guys... does anyone know how to center a wrap on document load
[10:30:19] <snover> what the fuck does that even mean
[10:30:24] <darren_p> lol
[10:30:36] <darren_p> A container div...
[10:30:56] <darren_p> I want to centralise it to the viewport
[10:31:20] <jmotta> yes, it points to an ajax call and then to an ajaxStart interceptor with my blockUI call .. apparently it is not being able to find my block div or my ajax call occurs so fast that something gets messed ...
[10:31:28] <iroxoru> margin-left: auto;
[10:31:28] <iroxoru>  	margin-right: auto;
[10:31:32] <iroxoru> darren
[10:31:33] <jmotta> oops .. sorry
[10:31:41] <speyburn> darren_p: modify the CSS code on the document load? or am i thinking this wrong?
[10:31:56] <speyburn> like iroxoru said
[10:32:07] <darren_p> speyburn, yes but how would I calculate the center?
[10:32:16] <iroxoru> you add the css lines i said about margin
[10:32:20] <iroxoru> and it auto calculates center like you want
[10:32:26] <sphinxxxx> has anyone used this? http://mobosurvey.com/
[10:32:34] <darren_p> I need to center the scroll bar, sorry.. I will explain better
[10:32:48] <iroxoru> add those lines to the css for the div your lookin to center
[10:33:05] <iroxoru> the scroll bar?
[10:33:20] <darren_p> Basically, I have a horizontal scroll website... it's 5721px in width, but I need to centralize to the viewport... so I'm guessing using scrollLeft(calculatedmiddle)
[10:33:33] <iroxoru> any link?
[10:33:41] <darren_p> One sec..
[10:34:22] <speyburn> http://jsfiddle.net/py5Mt/1/ is there a way that i could show only one ".dlinfo" div and not all of them im this code? without having to use unique id's ?
[10:34:56] <darren_p> iroxoru: http://bigpepperdesign.com/test/first-point/
[10:35:30] <darren_p> div ID 'section4' needs to be central to viewport... just can't figure out how to calculate
[10:37:54] <iroxoru> hmm im not sure how to do that off the top of my head
[10:38:03] <iroxoru> maybe have it onload link to a div in the page
[10:38:38] <sphinxxxx> darren_p, in dom ready, calculate the windows height/width, then set margins accordingly
[10:38:48] <cnnr> If I have an <li>, with a <span> inside of it, how can I get just the text of the <li>, and not the text inside of the <span>, too? I've tried using .not, and haven't been able to get it just yet.
[10:39:11] <sphinxxxx> $(li span).text()
[10:39:17] <darren_p> sphinxxx, this wouldn't alter horizontal scroll though would it?
[10:39:17] <pachet> darren_p: http://jsfiddle.net/w7WuC/
[10:39:23] <sphinxxxx> oh the li
[10:39:26] <sphinxxxx> sry :)
[10:39:29] <cnnr> yeah just the li
[10:39:29] <cnnr> :D
[10:41:02] <iroxoru> anyway
[10:41:05] <iroxoru> sorry i couldn't help but
[10:41:09] <iroxoru> i think thats a bad idea
[10:41:19] <iroxoru> to design your page where you want it to use the scroll bar
[10:41:33] <iroxoru> there are much better ways i think to utilize jquery
[10:41:39] <iroxoru> to have that multiple page effect
[10:41:41] <iroxoru> in one html file
[10:41:45] <darren_p> sphinxxx, just going to check the code.. will this center the scroll bar?
[10:42:10] <darren_p> iroxoru, gotta do what client says
[10:42:14] <pachet> just check the fiddle i posted, jeez
[10:42:18] <pachet> ;[
[10:42:40] <darren_p> sorry pachet :/ Will try on my site, few moments
[10:43:10] <FinalAngel> el.find('input[type="radio"]').attr('checked', 'checked');
[10:43:17] <FinalAngel> how can I make that actually work?
[10:43:31] <monk13> so why doesn't jquery append the hyperlink here? and just the text?
[10:43:32] <monk13> http://jsfiddle.net/wM58C/
[10:43:37] <FinalAngel> how can I select a specific radiobox
[10:45:18] <darren_p> pachet, thank you so much...
[10:45:30] <pachet> no sweat
[10:45:32] <God__> How dare someone use my name 'God'!!!!!!
[10:45:41] <darren_p> You obviously know a thing or two about JS!
[10:45:44] <iroxoru> monk wheres the <a to start it
[10:45:51] <darren_p> Thank you again, you have saved my basoc
[10:45:56] <pachet> its more geometry than js
[10:45:56] <darren_p> *bacon
[10:45:56] <pachet> yw
[10:46:04] <darren_p> Yes..
[10:46:05] <God__> God and God_: I WILL BURN YOU IN A UNIVERSE THAT HAS NO TIME!
[10:46:17] <ajpiano> God__: surely you have better things to do?
[10:46:31] <Madonna> ajpiano: Yes.
[10:46:35] <ajpiano> lol
[10:46:49] <iroxoru> patchet is g00d
[10:46:50] <monk13> iroxoru, dam... I thought i could just do $('<a/>') to create the element. is that possible? i guess i know how to select a jquery element with selectors. but what if you want to create an element using jquery then append it to something
[10:46:56] <Eviltwin> monk13: http://jsfiddle.net/wM58C/1/ ?
[10:47:12] <tera_> LOL
[10:47:14] <Madonna> Is it possible to have two versions of jQuery running on the same page?
[10:47:20] <ajpiano> it is
[10:47:28] <iroxoru> monk im not sure just takin a stab
[10:47:30] <Eviltwin> Madonna: But it's not recommended
[10:48:57] <monk13> Eviltwin, thanks! How come me using .html() didn't just output the html to the append? like basically equal $('#add_here').append("<a href='...'>...</a>")
[10:49:40] <Eviltwin> monk13: Because .html() represents the "inner HTML" or the HTML *inside* the tag
[10:49:43] <Eviltwin> Not including the tag
[10:49:59] <iroxoru> thought it was something with that .html
[10:50:16] <monk13> Eviltwin, cool thanks for the explanation.
[10:51:09] <Eviltwin> With jQuery if you ask, "Why can't I just X?" usually the answer is "There's a better way" or "Actually you can"
[10:55:22] <pachet> is that so ;o
[10:56:25] <pachet> actually i'll retract that
[10:56:29] <pachet> <3 jq
[10:57:27] <iroxoru> can someone look at my link and tell me if the content loads first or the if the content fades in first?
[10:57:28] <iroxoru> http://www.pendaslaw.com/blank11.php
[10:58:33] <pachet> the answer to that is going to depend on how long it takes someone to download your javascript
[10:58:46] <iroxoru> hmmm
[10:58:46] <pachet> if it takes a while, they're going to notice a jump before your hide()s take effect
[10:58:58] <iroxoru> ok
[10:59:01] <iroxoru> when i hit refresh in some browsers
[10:59:11] <iroxoru> the content kind of does a flash from visible to hidden and then starts the fading
[10:59:13] <|RicharD|> how i can resize
[10:59:16] <iroxoru> other browsers instantly fade it in
[10:59:18] <|RicharD|> the datepicker(inlline)
[10:59:22] <|RicharD|> of jquery ui ?
[10:59:45] <iroxoru> pachet is there any jquery i can use to fix that?
[11:00:50] <pachet> you should style those elements to be hidden using css, rather than .hide()
[11:01:04] <iroxoru> ok
[11:01:05] <pachet> that way they'll be invisible initially, even if the scripts arent done loading yet
[11:01:10] <|RicharD|> anyone can suggest me ?
[11:01:23] <pachet> then you can handle anyone that doesnt have js enabled with <noscript>
[11:02:25] <speyburn> http://jsfiddle.net/py5Mt/1/ is there a way that i could show only one ".dlinfo" div and not all of them im this code? without having to use unique id's ?
[11:03:55] <jak> that's not a great idea though. why not have some in-page javascript at the top that adds a has-js class to the html root, then use that to provide javascript specific styles (like display:none) - that way you dont have to use an unsupported tag like noscript and it will load fine on non-js browsers
[11:05:42] <iroxoru> jak i used display:none
[11:05:52] <iroxoru> and i think it fixed my small loading problem
[11:08:43] <iroxoru> whats has-js
[11:11:18] <iroxoru> nm i get it ;/
[11:12:36] <jedimind> do you
[11:12:40] <jedimind> DO YOU REALLY!?!!!?
[11:12:43] <jedimind> ANSWER MEEEEEE
[11:13:15] <sadmicrowave> anyone using jquery highcharts? I'm trying to figure out how to apply a different theme and I don't see that as an option inside the "new Highcharts.Chart({...})" initiator
[11:13:19] <jmotta> I'm having a problem with the blockUI plugin, some times when I interact with the user with a dialog then I give an option to the user that in response triggers an ajax call apparently the blockUI receives the selector of my loading div with an invalid context / state, someone knows what it could be?
[11:13:55] <pachet> jak: noscript is unsupported? ;o
[11:13:59] <pachet> i can understand 'unreliable'
[11:14:58] <Dr4g> jqTransform plugin changes my checkboxes to nice new ones, but the label's for="" attribute no longer works. When i click the label it doesn't check the new <span> tag that jqTransform made to imitate the checkbox.
[11:15:04] <Dr4g> Has anyone found a callback, or a workaround for this ?
[11:19:10] <pachet> speyburn: not sure if this is what you're going for, but you can check the headline index against the info index like this : http://jsfiddle.net/Dw76x/
[11:19:25] <Offlein> If I  .click() on something, I change it to a textfield. I want to have the textfield change back to regular text when they unclick. Should I use a .blur() method on the new textfield input? And can I put that binding inside the .click() callback function?
[11:19:30] <CodeZombie> hey, when using jquery-ui draggable, with the clone helper, how would you access the clone element? I'd like to resize the clone to a smaller size.
[11:20:06] <pachet> speyburn: also, a bit out of place to comment on this, but when you echo in php
[11:20:11] <sadmicrowave> scratch my last question - figured it out
[11:20:12] <pachet> you should echo with single quotes when possible
[11:20:23] <pachet> otherwise php has to check those strings for variables
[11:20:46] <pachet> faster and more readable to break single quote strings for a variable
[11:21:43] <jugstah> hmm
[11:21:58] <speyburn> pachet: yeah i know that, bad habit and stuck to it, should learn to use singles :) but this did the trick, thank you so much!
[11:22:08] <speyburn> i have been searching for a way to do that for the past 3 hours
[11:22:41] <speyburn> pachet: u savet the rest of my night! :)
[11:22:52] <pachet> np :O
[11:30:48] <jugstah> anyone got a min to look at this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/E34m6/6/
[11:31:26] <jugstah> basically, the event wont fire if there isnt a value in the Months box

[11:32:09] <dnlmzw> Anyone know how to connect to a server over SSH via Mac's Terminal?
[11:32:36] <dabear> simply run the ssh command?
[11:33:09] <jugstah> the problem with this fiddle is that if there is no value in the months box, the event wont fire
[11:33:27] <wib> dabear: open up the terminal, type ssh user@hostname and hit enter?
[11:33:39] <dnlmzw> dabear - whats the command? like where does the ip go and the pw?
[11:34:15] <dabear> dnlmzw: man ssh
[11:34:22] <dabear> it will tell you
[11:35:22] <dnlmzw> yes. and sorry if this seems way to logical! but i have never tried this before. so i could really need some guidance. i have tried to read out of the help by typing ssh, but its to confusing!
[11:35:47] <jugstah> try googling for ideas
[11:36:30] <jugstah> ssh NetID@u.arizona.edu
[11:37:21] <jugstah> basically, ssh username@ip/hostname
[11:37:24] <dnlmzw> thanks a lot! :)
[11:37:31] <dnlmzw> i think this will work!

[11:45:02] <jugstah> pachet- looking, thanks for taking a minute out of your day
[11:45:14] <pachet> you should probably assign parseInt(months) to its own variable and just check against that though

[11:48:29] <b1lly1> isArray isnt returning correctly
[11:49:19] <jak> nascro: store its initial position somewhere, maybe in a .data() ?
[11:49:23] <pachet> nascro: store the original position with var a=$(elem); a.data('initial', a.offset().left);

[11:51:38] <scottm> I have a mousedown function and a mouse leave funtion. I want to see if the mouse is down in mouseleave before I do any actions. I can't find a bolean return to see if mousedown is true
[11:51:41] <dropmouse> hey all. if I wanted to place an item (fixed position) ontop of another image (like a bubble tip). how do I get the position of an element in relation to the screen, like x pixels over and y pixels from top of vieable screen?
[11:52:09] <scottm> Any idea how to do that other than make a global?
[11:52:11] <pachet> b1lly1: if(myvar instanceOf Array) //it's an array
[11:52:51] <pachet> scottm: bind mouseleave within your mousedown binding
[11:52:55] <pachet> then unbind it on mouseup
[11:53:05] <scottm> perfect thanks a ton
[11:53:36] <jak> dropmouse: look at offset()
[11:53:38] <pachet> ?.offset() @ dropmouse

[11:59:14] <iroxoru> Any of you guys used Google Swiffy? Google's tool to convert Flash to Jquery?
[11:59:59] <tomasm-> can find() be used with a string of html to extract certain elements?
[11:59:59] <iroxoru> it let me convert a flash menu that im using to jquery and it did it very well
[12:00:08] <iroxoru> but the text looks a little wierd on some of the letter spacing
[12:00:13] <tomasm-> ie $('string of html').find('div')
[12:01:14] <|RicharD|> http://studio.quarantastudio.it/events/index/ why when i change date
[12:01:23] <|RicharD|> it not select the date that i selected before ?
[12:01:31] <|RicharD|> and how i can do ?i read of defaultDate
[12:01:43] <|RicharD|> and many solutions on stackoverflow but not work :(
[12:03:08] <|RicharD|> any guggest ?
[12:03:42] <sadmicrowave> OMG HighCharts is the bomb!
[12:04:26] <jak> tomasm- are you specifically looking for the div, or just checking if the string exists?
[12:05:53] <dropmouse> jak, that was cool. that will come in useful.. can use it wil scrollTop and get this nice scroll to action effect.
[12:06:38] <tomasm-> jak, i have a bunch of code and need to extract the <script> tags so i can eval them
[12:06:46] <dropmouse> Now, I'm currently trying to just set the position via css, but this doesn't seem to be working well. What's the jQuery way of moving elements around the screen
[12:07:02] <jak> dropmouse there is a very good scrollTo plugin if you intend on doing a lot of scrolling around
[12:07:21] <jak> dropmouse, css is the right way!
[12:07:38] <dropmouse> alright, thanks for input jak...
[12:08:01] <jak> tomasm- ah then im not sure, cant think of a simple way to do that. someone else may know..
[12:08:02] <tomasm-> i want a way to parse a string of html into somethin where i can use find() on it
[12:08:47] <pachet> tomasm: http://jsfiddle.net/ka8UP/
[12:09:22] <pachet> but you arent going to be able to eval() on script elements within jquery
[12:09:32] <pachet> well
[12:09:40] <pachet> it depends where the string is originating
[12:10:04] <pachet> if its the html response from an ajax load or something, jq automatically strips the tags and evals them for you
[12:10:07] <pachet> so
[12:10:10] <pachet> be forewarned ;o
[12:10:58] <tomasm-> pachet, no it's set to html, and it would normally evaluate it but this is a file upload, so it's an iframe that doesnt have the $() object defined.
[12:10:58] <jugstah> hmm pachet when you said to assign months to its own var and check against it, what did you mean specifically? check if its null?
[12:11:15] <Genesis730> So i was talkin to someone the other day, I thought their name was cold somethin, anyone know a regular by that name?
[12:11:33] <pachet> jugstah: in your original question it sounded like you only wanted to check if the months field was empty
[12:12:02] <pachet> the fiddle i posted checks both fields, since it checks the variable sum of their values
[12:13:35] <jugstah> pachet- ok... after repeated testing, it looks like it eventually broke in my app
[12:13:41] <jugstah> i'll test to see whats going on
[12:14:25] <jugstah> at some point, I can enter a 2yrs, 11mos and the previous employment would stay open
[12:16:09] <jugstah> works perfectly in fiddler thus far
[12:17:22] <SEJeff_work> I've got a $(window).resize() callback to resize a div's height to 75% if it's height is > ($(window).height() - 50). It does it like: ("#output").animate({'height': "75%"}, 'slow');
[12:17:41] <SEJeff_work> How can I make it immediately animate and only once when the user is resizing the window around a bunch

[12:29:40] <pellin0r3> hey guys
[12:29:45] <pellin0r3> i could use some help with something.
[12:29:49] <jugstah> thank god for firebug
[12:29:49] <pellin0r3> any takers?
[12:30:16] <pachet> ?ask
[12:30:16] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:30:32] <SEJeff_work> jugstah, Firebug? You poor soul! The chromium web inspector is so much nicer imo.
[12:31:25] <pellin0r3> OK, so I have this php method for generating a table. It creates  a table in pure HTML. What I need to do is grab the HTML from this page, and display it on my wordpress page.     I have been trying to use the .get() method, but I keep breaking it because I have no idea what I'm doing. Any advice?
[12:32:19] <SEJeff_work> pellin0r3, Why not just put your php in the wp theme?
[12:32:33] <SEJeff_work> Seems like a better way to do it
[12:32:50] <pellin0r3> well, its kinda complicated. It is located on teh same server, and that is waaay more work than what is worth it.
[12:33:04] <pellin0r3> This is code that I did not write, and it is SUPER SHITTY
[12:33:16] <pellin0r3> so to change everything in the whole function would be a nightmare
[12:33:28] <pellin0r3> I just figured I could grab the HTML code, and display it.
[12:34:21] <pachet> do you want the whole php page, or just a portion of it
[12:34:33] <pellin0r3> it is not a php page
[12:34:36] <pellin0r3> it is HTML
[12:34:42] <pellin0r3> that is generated by php.
[12:34:47] <pachet> ...
[12:34:49] <jak> semantics..
[12:35:17] <pellin0r3> so the table is already perfect. i need teh whole thing. It is just a table containing a bunch of stuff
[12:35:23] <pachet> i'm not sure what a php page would be then ;o
[12:35:42] <pellin0r3> i just need a command to visit teh page and grab teh HTML from it.
[12:35:55] <pachet> ?load @ pellin0r3
[12:35:55] <jak> pellin0r3: you already found it, .get()
[12:35:55] <bot-t> pellin0r3, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:35:59] <pachet> er...
[12:36:24] <pachet> $('foo').load('mypage.php');
[12:36:56] <jak> pachet.. that won't work? :/
[12:37:36] <pellin0r3> well, the problem isn't getting it to execute
[12:37:41] <pellin0r3> the problem is getting it to displa inside of the wordpress page.
[12:37:45] <pellin0r3> without navigating away
[12:38:06] <pachet> jak: why is that ;o
[12:38:10] <jak> pellin0r3, this would be much easier if you can point to what you've achieved so far?
[12:38:21] <pellin0r3> I HAVE ACHIEVED NOTHING!
[12:38:32] <pellin0r3> and I don't really wanna share the page lol
[12:38:35] <jak> pachet.. read the docs, load is an event handler!
[12:38:37] <pellin0r3> kinda sensative stuff
[12:38:50] <pachet> jak: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:39:04] <SEJeff_work> pellin0r3. In the wordpress page create something like <div id="awesometable"></div> Then in your javascript do something like $.get("url", function(data) { $("#awesometable").html(data); });
[12:39:10] <pachet> dont let bot-t's shortcomings confuse you ;o
[12:39:19] <jak> a-ha!
[12:39:27] <jak> i've never seen that before
[12:39:41] <pellin0r3> hmm, i seeee. so what the hell is $.get(
[12:39:49] <SEJeff_work> jesus dude
[12:39:49] <pellin0r3> what is the dollar sign?
[12:39:53] <SEJeff_work> pellin0r3, Do you read the docs at all?
[12:40:00] <jak> lol
[12:40:12] <pellin0r3> Yeah, I have. I am woefully inept at javascript lol
[12:40:14] <SEJeff_work> pellin0r3, This is not #IwillDoyourJobforYou
[12:40:16] <SEJeff_work> Ok
[12:40:16] <pellin0r3> ITS AN INTERSHIP OK??
[12:40:25] <DyeA> hehe
[12:40:32] <SEJeff_work> pellin0r3, $ generally denotes a jQuery object
[12:40:35] <DyeA> $.fail()
[12:40:45] <pachet> .load, $.get(), $.getJSON, $.post --> derivations of .ajax()
[12:40:51] <pachet> differ in syntax and required arguments
[12:40:55] <SEJeff_work> $.get denotes jQuery.get, which you can find the docs for http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/.
[12:41:05] <pellin0r3> yeah Im supposed to have someone working over me
[12:41:10] <pellin0r3> he has just decided to quit showing up :\
[12:41:18] <jak> how wonderfully confusing to have two very different functions with the same name
[12:41:18] <pellin0r3> but thanks for your help!
[12:41:35] <SEJeff_work> pellin0r3, pachet just nailed it. the load, get, getJSON, and post methods are just convenience wrappers ontop of the $.ajax method.
[12:41:41] <SEJeff_work> ha
[12:42:46] <jak> i get the feeling that internship won't result in a job offer
[12:43:40] <SEJeff_work> jak, hahaha. When you said you have never seen that before, what did you mean?
[12:44:39] <jak> load as a wrapper over ajax. only ever used .ajax or .get
[12:44:54] <SEJeff_work> Ah
[12:45:15] <SEJeff_work> $("form").serialize() + $.post is nice too
[12:48:29] <SEJeff_work> Is it possible to use a jquery like selector to navigate a html string?
[12:48:33] <SEJeff_work> Just curious
[12:48:40] <ajpiano> SEJeff_work: yes
[12:48:46] <ajpiano> $( htmlStr ).filter(".wat");
[12:48:50] <ajpiano> but now you got actual elements
[12:48:52] <ajpiano> not strings

[12:57:41] <FNTom> You need to create it? Have you seen elFinder before? :o
[12:57:49] <sgrover> must be IE8 compatible, as well as more modern (Chrome/FF/IE9/etc.)
[12:57:57] <sgrover> never heard of elFinder
[12:58:01] <SEJeff_work> sgrover, It might be easier (but ugly) to namespace a newer jquery somewhere other than $
[12:58:15] <SEJeff_work> and just use one of the various _modern_ plugins for this
[12:58:56] <sgrover> SEJeff_work: updating the libraries is scheduled for next phase of the project..  But yeah, that was my knee-jerk reaction too.

[12:59:04] <FNTom> Version 2: http://elfinder.org/
[12:59:47] <FNTom> As for the jQuery version, make the upgrade it.
[13:00:59] <p3llin0r3> Ok, one last thing.  I need to replace everything in my jquery element with the data I get with teh .get() method.  What should I type?
[13:01:18] <p3llin0r3> this is what I have so far:                     $.get('/batch_/runBatches_custom.php?client=' + client + '&from=' + from + '&to=' + to + '&period=' + period,  function(data)  { alert('foop'); $.("div.cheese").replaceWith(data); });
[13:01:23] <p3llin0r3> and the div's name is cheese.
[13:01:36] <samuelcole> oh, also for my focus problem, it appears focused, and i get keyup events with the correct e.target, but no text is inserted, and there is no selection caret
[13:01:56] <sgrover> FNTom and SEJeff_work:  Thanks for the suggestions.  ELFinder is looking promising (so far).
[13:02:05] * SEJeff_work weeps
[13:02:17] <p3llin0r3> SEeff
[13:02:19] <p3llin0r3> I love you.
[13:02:23] <p3llin0r3> don't forget that.
[13:02:38] <SEJeff_work> p3llin0r3, Instead of generating the manual query url
[13:02:48] <p3llin0r3> mmhm
[13:03:10] <SEJeff_work> Try the 2nd argument to $.get being an object with the arguments. Thats a more jquery-ish way to do it
[13:03:41] <jak> SEJeff_work, lets not confuse the intern. p3llin0r3: $("div.cheese").load(''/batch_/runBatches_custom.php?client=' + client + '&from=' + from + '&to=' + to + '&period=' + period);
[13:04:04] <SEJeff_work> $.get("your/url/", {client: client, from: from, to: to, period: period}, function(data)...
[13:04:07] <SEJeff_work> p3llin0r3, ^^
[13:04:20] <jak> you can thank pachet for that!
[13:04:34] <SEJeff_work> ha
[13:04:55] <SEJeff_work> p3llin0r3, jQuery will do the right thing and put the ? and & between the arguments for you if you use {} properly.
[13:05:20] <p3llin0r3> hmm. well I successfully fetch the html code. But I understand where you are coming from. Ill do that. But, that is not what I am asking for. How do I nuke the current jquery element and in its place put the HTML code?
[13:05:27] <pachet> p3llin0r3: the problem is with your selector
[13:05:47] <pachet> $.("div.cheese") should be $('#cheese')
[13:05:50] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!!!!!! :-))))))))))
[13:05:51] <p3llin0r3> I tried "*", but that crashes.
[13:06:37] <jak> p3llin0r3, are you using <div class="cheese"> or <div id="cheese"> ?
[13:06:50] <jak> or... neither..?
[13:06:58] <pachet> lol
[13:07:01] <seutje> <cheese class="div">!
[13:07:11] <pachet> <cheese></cheese>
[13:07:22] <p3llin0r3> <div id = "cheese">
[13:07:29] <pachet> yeah
[13:07:33] <pachet> my comment^
[13:07:39] <SEJeff_work> p3llin0r3, $("#cheese")
[13:07:56] <SEJeff_work> what pachet already said
[13:08:40] <p3llin0r3> :D
[13:08:43] <p3llin0r3> :DDDDDDDDDDDDD
[13:08:51] <p3llin0r3> Thank you so much.
[13:08:56] <p3llin0r3> I GOT IT!
[13:09:01] <p3llin0r3> IM GONNA GO MASTERBATE!
[13:09:14] <SEJeff_work> watch out for your eye *zing*
[13:09:25] <pachet> i need an intern like that
[13:09:30] <pachet> my interns are boring and dependable
[13:09:33] <Lurzino> I have just a <a href="../../myfile.zip" target="_blank">Download the file</a> .... is there a way with javascript/jquery to catch the event RIGHT after the download so I can delete the file ?
[13:09:52] <josh____> So I am setting a herf with attr $("#foo").attr('herf','url.php?var="quoted_string"') and the quotes are important.  but this encodes them as %22 and breaks the accepting script (which I don't contol) now can I set an herf would using the encoded quotes ?
[13:09:52] <pachet> and do their own work
[13:09:56] <josh____> thanks
[13:12:19] <jak> Lurzino, if you're trying to determine when the download has been completed - i don't believe there is a way to do that
[13:12:56] <SEJeff_work> Lurzino, What is the use case for deleting a file after it has been downloaded? A pdf or something that should open up in a viewer?
[13:13:49] <Lurzino> SEJeff_work no, really it's a XML file which has to be re-generated after download
[13:15:09] <SEJeff_work> Lurzino, Ah thats a very awkward workflow. Perhaps that is the issue.
[13:15:40] <SEJeff_work> Javascript couldn't do that due to the same origin policy stuff I believe and there is no api to delete a file either.
[13:16:55] <Lurzino> SEJeff_work... about delete a file it exists a PHP function to do that and I could do an ajax call to that php file to delete the file
[13:17:29] <jak> except, you can't know when to delete the file
[13:18:12] <Lurzino> jak that's why I was asking
[13:18:16] <Lurzino> :)
[13:18:47] <jak> assuming the php generates the xml file, could you just have the php output the xml directly. then you know its done once
[13:22:10] <keiron> Hi, has anyone observed $.each looping through data in reverse in Google Chrome?
[13:25:20] <pachet> keiron: not reversed specifically, but there was an issue with chrome's interpreter and for loop orders
[13:25:26] <pachet> but that was years ago ;o
[13:25:56] <keiron> pachet: i'm  using the latest version of chrome for mac
[13:26:08] <keiron> pachet: 14.0.835.186
[13:27:05] <keiron> someone else has reported it on stackoverflow on january 30th
[13:27:12] <keiron> i guess it's possible the bug has crept back in
[13:28:07] <SEJeff_work> keiron, Using Chromium 15.0.871.0 (Developer Build 99583 Linux) I don't see that issue
[13:29:38] <pachet> keiron: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=883
[13:32:07] <keiron> pachet: thanks, looks like positions of properties in an object cannot be relied upon
[13:34:03] <webroasters> hi guys. How would the .live and .after functions work together? I'm obviously somewhat of a noob
[13:35:00] <webroasters> hold on 1 sec
[13:35:13] <pachet> *holds*
[13:35:50] <webroasters> lol, nvm
[13:36:29] <keiron> pachet, SEJecc_work: I removed the ids that were being used as keys for my properties and it fixed the problem
[13:36:33] <keiron> thanks for your help
[13:36:36] <keiron> bye
[13:37:09] <webroasters> yeah, so how would that work? I'm trying to interact with the after and live function. Here's the current code: $('.variation:last').after(var_html);
[13:38:00] <webroasters> i want to make it  work with .live()
[13:39:11] <SEJeff_work> webroasters, Please reproduce what you've done at jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[13:39:15] <SEJeff_work> Much easier to debug then
[13:40:56] <webroasters> well, time's run out, I've gotta run. End of the work day. I'll get back on tomorrow and go through things with you folks. Thanks man
[13:43:24] <narkeeso> I'm trying to build a search query url with jq - var search_value = 'search?q=' + $('.search-input').val();
[13:43:30] <narkeeso> why does everything after ? not show up?
[13:43:37] <narkeeso> .val() is picking up the input correctly
[13:46:02] <jedimind_> if i rip out sizzle selector engine and use Slick instead with jquery
[13:46:14] <jedimind_> will that basically reserve me a slot in a special place of hell
[13:46:32] <pachet> narkeeso: where isn't it showing up? http://jsfiddle.net/b4L4d/ looks fine to me
[13:46:52] <narkeeso> pachet: not showing up when the form is submitted
[13:47:06] <narkeeso> so in the url, if you were to pass that to action=""
[13:47:13] <narkeeso> nothing after ? shows up
[13:47:22] <pachet> $('#hell').find('.jedimind')
[13:48:16] <jugstah> when a page is refreshed or reloaded, how do i check if a radio button is "checked"?
[13:48:34] <jedimind_> i wonder how difficult it would be to rip out sizzle and replace it
[13:48:37] <jugstah> ("input[name='co_applicant_rent_own']").click(OnClickOrCheck); works perfectly when i click it
[13:48:51] <jugstah> but if the page reloads, i want the same function fired if the radio button is clicked?
[13:49:16] <jugstah> err, 'was selected'
[13:50:06] <jedimind_> $('input[name="checkbox"]:selected').each( $("input[name='co_applicant_rent_own']").trigger('click'); );
[13:50:17] <jedimind_> assuming you still have your click event available
[13:51:19] <jedimind_> only, try to keep your ' and "s consistent unlike my example
[13:51:44] <jugstah> ok
[13:51:58] <jugstah> $("input[name='co_applicant_rent_own']").trigger('click');
[13:52:06] <jugstah> that was what i originally had
[13:52:10] <jugstah> that didnt fire on a page reload
[13:52:42] <jedimind_> well it should be in document.ready of course
[13:52:43] <jugstah> trying your example
[13:52:55] <jugstah> yup its in doc ready
[13:53:07] <pachet> should just call the function directly
[13:53:20] <pachet> if("input[name='co_applicant_rent_own']").is(':checked'))OnClickOrCheck();
[13:53:54] <pachet> er...
[13:54:01] <pachet> missing a $() wrapper in there
[13:54:04] <pachet> but you get the idea
[13:54:18] <jedimind_> and you have an extra )
[13:54:19] <jedimind_> :)
[13:54:44] <pachet> thats the closure from the ghost wrapper
[13:54:50] <pachet> :[
[13:55:24] <jugstah> trying sec :-)
[13:55:58] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use templates?
[13:56:22] <jugstah> if($("input[name='co_applicant_rent_own']").is(':checked'))OnClickOrCheck(); looks right?
[13:56:26] <ProLoser|Work> i am having trouble doing {{tmpl( someFunction( anotherFunction() )}}, i get an 'unexpected )' error
[13:58:07] <jugstah> some sort of nodename error
[13:58:07] <jugstah> hmm
[14:00:24] <jedimind_> ProLoser|Work, you're missing a )

[14:04:09] <ProLoser|Work> jedimind_: exactly, tmpl has given me a lot of migraines
[14:04:48] <jedimind_> ive been switching to mustache instead
[14:04:50] <ProLoser|Work> if you call a template from a template and iterate, you get weird variable ghosting

[14:05:03] <jedimind_> but im not sure it'll even help
[14:05:04] <ProLoser|Work> sorta too late to do now though
[14:05:07] <ProLoser|Work> why is that?
[14:05:10] <ProLoser|Work> is all the syntax the same?
[14:07:25] <jedimind_> no because im not sure what it's support of recursive templating is
[14:07:33] <jedimind_> no syntax is different

[14:13:20] <DoctorDarren> Good evening, gentlemen. I have a <div class="example"> that contains a lot of input elements, each of which has an ID in the format "id_rrf-0-random_word" where the number (0 in this case) is the same for every input element in this "example" div, but the random_word changes for each.
[14:13:28] <cody--> ill take a look at the stoppropagation
[14:13:44] <DoctorDarren> If I'm referring to the "example" div somewhere else, what's the best way to get the number (0 in this case...) from the parent example div?
[14:14:08] <Dave_Stein> DoctorDarren that looks my old code
[14:14:12] <DoctorDarren> Basically asking, "Here is an example div. What is the number in the ID of all its input elements?"
[14:14:36] <Dave_Stein> DoctorDarren: <div random_id="0"> then on click = $(this).closest('[random_id]').attr('random_id')
[14:14:54] <Dave_Stein> DoctorDarren someone else might have better suggestion but that's better than string.replace on id
[14:15:29] <DoctorDarren> Dave_Stein: Well I'm just trying to grab the number (0), and nothing else in this case :/
[14:15:45] <Dave_Stein> that's why it's better as an attribute than a number in a string within the id attribute
[14:16:01] <Dave_Stein> you can still do <div id="x-0-random" random_id="0"> if you want
[14:16:04] <DoctorDarren> Dave_Stein: Ah sorry I understand what you mean.
[14:16:47] <DoctorDarren> Dave_Stein: It's actually due to the backend framework we're using. All those elements are automatically generated with IDs in that format.
[14:16:59] <DoctorDarren> I could add the attribute though.
[14:17:18] <DoctorDarren> If I did though, use the .closest()?
[14:17:25] <DoctorDarren> New to jQ, haven't heard f that before.
[14:17:48] <Dave_Stein> ?closest @doctordarren
[14:17:48] <bot-t> doctordarren, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:18:47] <DoctorDarren> Dave_Stein: Ah that moves upwards, I'm starting at the surrounding div so I need to go in the other direction. Like get the first child I think.
[14:18:58] <Dave_Stein> ?find @doctordarren
[14:18:58] <bot-t> doctordarren, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/

[14:20:39] <Dave_Stein> check the API before coming here please :)
[14:22:26] <DoctorDarren> Dave_Stein: Ah apologies, I was reading about that but I figured it still grabbed all the elements before just giving the first so there would be slower. Thanks though!
[14:22:35] <ProLoser|Work> what am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/449DC/
[14:22:37] <Dave_Stein> oh yeah it will still do that
[14:23:01] <Dave_Stein> but it shouldn't be a huge issue and if it is you should add a class to thing you want to be first, and then select that in find
[14:23:20] <DoctorDarren> Got it. Thanks!
[14:23:27] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work: i dont understand, youre console logging amnd not calling range

[14:26:59] <Dr4g> ben_alman: yo
[14:27:11] <Dr4g> you got a plugin to take an object/array in JS and make a Query String out of it?
[14:27:14] <Dr4g> What about your bbq plugin ?
[14:27:24] <Dave_Stein> Dr4g that's what bbq does
[14:27:34] <Dave_Stein> i love that plugin
[14:27:48] <ravenzz> DoctorDarren http://jsfiddle.net/8a2yR/ ?
[14:28:09] <Dr4g> Dave_Stein: I suspected so, it's been a few years since i used it.
[14:28:47] <Dr4g> I gotta .submit() on a form, i need to make an AJAX call and grab data from the form an generate QueryString format to the PHP side of stuff.
[14:28:51] <Dr4g> ?bbq @ Dr4g
[14:28:52] <bot-t> Dr4g, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/

[14:29:15] <bot-t> Dr4g, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:29:21] <Dave_Stein> kborchers damn it i was about to type that
[14:29:25] <kborchers> heh
[14:29:28] <kborchers> too slow
[14:30:40] <Dave_Stein> kborchers its cause im hating PHP right now in my other window
[14:30:43] <Dr4g> kborchers: well the current page is working on query string so people can send the link somewhere and the relevant filters/form fields are retained.
[14:31:08] <Dr4g> Dave_Stein: i also have some retarded format that i need to support, like this..
[14:31:18] <Dr4g> &vendor[]=90&vendor[]=55
[14:31:38] <ravenzz> DoctorDarren http://jsfiddle.net/8a2yR/1/
[14:31:43] <Dr4g> If you try to use an object with the key name as { "vendor[]" } it will override the previous guy (duplicate keys), am i right ?
[14:31:55] <jedimind_> anyone know of a decent site that compares all the selector engines ?
[14:36:14] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: Apologies, stepped away there, will check that out now!
[14:37:49] <Dr4g> Aha, it seems serialize() does work nicely. :)
[14:38:21] <Dave_Stein> jedimind_ you can google that, although jquery always wins which is why i started using it :)
[14:38:32] <jedimind_> not true
[14:38:55] <jedimind_> Slick selector engine seems to cover a lot of cases that sizzle doesnt
[14:39:32] <jedimind_> like :nth-last-child
[14:39:39] <jedimind_> and :first-of-type
[14:39:41] <jedimind_> among others
[14:40:14] <jedimind_> NWMatcher also has more support than sizzle, but is like 2x the size
[14:41:42] <mikeric> if i have a bunch of element with the same selector, how can i get the .val() of each?
[14:42:00] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: Thanks for that, regex is spot on.
[14:42:10] <mikeric> when iterating through them, for some reason they are just integer values.. (e.g. [0,1,2,3,4])
[14:42:32] <mikeric> so i obviously cannot call .val() on them.
[14:43:09] <ravenzz> which kind of elements are those?
[14:43:42] <mikeric> ravenzz: they are select elements

[15:12:09] <amh345> how can i inspect what 'this' has in it?
[15:12:14] <jpolan> hello, is it possible to get an iframe's source once a user has left the original URL (by clicking on a link). I understand that this is prevented by design but is there a hack around it?
[15:12:27] <Eviltwin> amh345: "inspect"?
[15:12:33] <amh345> im trying to debug a alert(this) but i cant get anything other than [object HTMLLIElement]
[15:12:53] <amh345> Eviltwin: sorry, im used to calling it inspect (from another language).  i just want to see what it contains.
[15:13:00] <Eviltwin> amh345: Are you using Chrome? Firefox?
[15:13:09] <amh345> any kind of distinguishing info would be good.
[15:13:16] <amh345> Eviltwin: im using chrome right now
[15:13:26] <amh345> but either is fine.
[15:13:28] <Eviltwin> Okay, switch from alert(...) to console.log(...)
[15:13:53] <Eviltwin> Have you used the Chrome Developer Tools before?
[15:14:33] <Eviltwin> View -> Developer -> JavaScript Console
[15:15:06] <amh345> oh. cool. thank you
[15:15:10] <gesman> Hello all
[15:15:20] <jimubao_> hi all
[15:15:31] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - that does work, thanks.. but is there a way to remove the id "baz" rather than just the id attribute?
[15:15:46] <jaequery> working with mootools is driving me craAZY , just FYI
[15:16:11] <gesman> Q: I have 2 utility scripts that use jQuery(document).ready(function($){...}); But it only works for first script, second will never gets executed. What's remedy for it ?
[15:16:38] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: It...does
[15:16:42] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: Have you done CSS selectors before?
[15:16:53] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin sure
[15:17:18] <starsinmypockets> Case being if there are multiple id's...
[15:17:20] <Eviltwin> What does #foo #baz do?
[15:17:31] <Eviltwin> Or h1 h2 { }
[15:17:50] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - they represent children, no
[15:18:09] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: What elements will be styled?
[15:19:22] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - it targets the proper element, but say the markup was <div id = "table baz important-selector">, won't removeAttr("id") remove all of those id's?
[15:19:25] <AliG1000> I need some help... I have a slider. If I wrap it in a form, I can submit it to abother page and have the 2 values of the slider show up in the url.  Good.  But how do I send these values to a database via ajax?
[15:19:49] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: ..........
[15:19:50] <AliG1000> I'm working from this example: http://blog.egorkhmelev.com/2009/11/jquery-slider-safari-style/
[15:20:12] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: Elements can have exactly 0 or 1 ids and each id can point to exactly 0 or 1 elements
[15:20:34] <Eviltwin> I think you're thinking of <div class="table baz important-selector">
[15:20:56] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - hah, well thanks for the schoolin'
[15:21:01] <Eviltwin> At which point you have .addClass and .removeClass
[15:21:45] <AliG1000> Can anyone help with the above problem?  I've been staring at it for 2 days now :)
[15:21:59] <Eviltwin> AliG1000: jsFiddle?
[15:22:54] <AliG1000> I tried JSFiddle - but for some reason it didn't work.  I do have it at  http://www.tamarindolive.com/slider/index.html   I am using the last two examples
[15:23:29] <Eviltwin> AliG1000: And what's the issue
[15:23:32] <AliG1000> It's so that I can input store times - hence the 24 hour clock
[15:24:35] <AliG1000> I can submit the values to another page using a form - and the values show up in a GET or POST.  But what I woulod really like to do is send those values to a database, and then return the fact that the values have been stored
[15:25:02] <AliG1000> I'm not sure which 'event' I should be listening to.
[15:25:38] <Eviltwin> So you want to do it when they submit the form?
[15:25:45] <Eviltwin> Like click that submit button?
[15:26:39] <AliG1000> I want to remove the submit button entirely - it wold be great if when the user moved the pointer, then that new value gets inserted into the database via ajax - no button needed
[15:27:45] <amh345> can someone look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/f2C6P/   im trying to toggle a div. but i dont think i have my (this).next("") working correctly.
[15:28:38] <AliG1000> the functions I've inserted at the top are borrowed from another script  that listens out for a 'keyup' event.  In this case, there is are no keys pressed, so I don't know what to listen for
[15:29:36] <AliG1000> this page suggests  'change':  http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/  I'll try that
[15:30:13] <Eviltwin> This is really bad jQuery code
[15:30:29] <AliG1000> thank you :)
[15:30:34] <Eviltwin> No, this guy's slider
[15:30:39] <Eviltwin> From the example you're following
[15:31:38] <AliG1000> it seems to work OK though - I just wish he had instructions for capturing the value (I'm still very much learning myself)
[15:32:31] <Eviltwin> I would try $("selector").onstatechange=function(){...}
[15:32:37] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[15:32:45] <Eviltwin> I would try $("selector").slider().onstatechange=function(){...}
[15:33:30] <AliG1000> trying it now....
[15:34:05] <Eviltwin> And $("selector").slider().getValue()
[15:34:08] <starsinmypockets> Hmm.. I'm trying to implement datatables using $("#table-js").datatables(); however this only selects the first table on the page :/
[15:34:24] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: Do you remember what I told you? At all?
[15:34:35] <Eviltwin> ****ONE**** element can have a particular ID
[15:34:39] <imsky> moskau moskau
[15:34:40] <Eviltwin> No more
[15:34:58] <Eviltwin> If you want to use the same name for a bunch of different things, use class
[15:41:24] <RobW> how do I listen to an iframe for change
[15:42:06] <tillMorning> http://pastebin.com/9EfmZkmi -- How to use toggle() function on all my divs, another div doesnt work? Help?
[15:43:13] <huntedmitch> Hey guys. Is there any way to divide the screen into two halves and detect which half the mouse is in without having to use hidden divs? I have a grid of approx 220 x 220px links and prev/next buttons on top. I want the buttons to only be visible when the mouse is in the half of the screen that those buttons are in.
[15:43:30] <starsinmypockets> Eviltwin - k gotcha - it's funny that all this time I never really got that
[15:46:23] <Moridine> huntedmitch: I'm not sure but you could try binding a mousemove event to the body tag
[15:46:41] <Moridine> http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[15:46:47] <Moridine> and then use the coordinates
[15:46:52] <huntedmitch> Moridine: Yeah, that thought just crossed my mind
[15:46:58] <huntedmitch> :-)
[15:47:21] <Moridine> although that might still be quite difficult if you have a centered layout I guess
[15:48:08] <Moridine> wait no, you could just divide the total page width by half and use that as the center point
[15:48:31] <Moridine> interesting question though :) I'm sure I'll end up trying it at some point
[15:48:50] <huntedmitch> I just though‚Ä¶ track the mouseYPos, if > screen width / 2 etc. etc.
[15:48:56] <AliG1000> Eviltwin: - am getting a little tied up in knots here.  I think 'onstatechange' is the correct one - but I still can't get it to work
[15:49:39] <tillMorning> http://pastebin.com/9EfmZkmi -- How to use toggle() function on all my divs, another div doesnt work? Help?
[15:49:59] <Eviltwin> Moridine: http://jsfiddle.net/egZHj/
[15:50:19] <amh345> can anyone help with this?  trying to get toggle to toggle a div.  http://jsfiddle.net/f2C6P/
[15:50:36] <Eviltwin> AliG1000: Try: $("selector").slider().onstatechange=function(){alert("Holy sh*t, it changed!")};
[15:51:26] <Eviltwin> amh345: First fix: http://jsfiddle.net/f2C6P/1/
[15:51:29] <Eviltwin> One or the other, not both
[15:51:59] <amh345> Eviltwin: i dont get it?
[15:52:22] <Eviltwin> You had alert(console.log(this))
[15:52:25] <Eviltwin> That makes no sense
[15:52:34] <amh345> oh. heh.  one sec
[15:52:39] <Eviltwin> I already fixed it
[15:53:31] <amh345> ok. but my issue wasnt actually with the alert.  i miscopied something into jsfiddle.  the console.log is working perfectly (thanks).   but now im trying to get to the original issue with was toggle.
[15:53:36] <Moridine> Eviltwin: thanks for that :) *saves a copy*
[15:54:04] <Eviltwin> amh345: This works: http://jsfiddle.net/f2C6P/2/
[15:54:41] <Eviltwin> .next() and .prev() navigate siblings
[15:54:41] <amh345> it does!!!  parent() was the issue?
[15:54:50] <amh345> oh
[15:54:57] <Eviltwin> It was the li that was clicked
[15:55:02] <Eviltwin> So you actually needed to go up to the ul
[15:55:45] <Eviltwin> Maybe .parent("ul") to be extra explicit
[15:55:53] <solidus-river> hey all, is there a way to pop content outside of a span
[15:55:56] <solidus-river> or insert it before a span?
[15:56:13] <enjoycrf> hey guys dont u think htis is kinda wack
[15:56:14] <enjoycrf> .tabs div:first-child
[15:56:18] <Eviltwin> ?.insertBefore @ solidus-river
[15:56:18] <bot-t1> solidus-river, .insertBefore(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[15:56:22] <enjoycrf> shouldnt it be .tabs:first-child
[15:56:26] <solidus-river> i have a span that is essentially a place holder indicating where i want to put new content
[15:56:29] <enjoycrf> div is the child
[15:56:32] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: :D
[15:56:52] <enjoycrf> that seems like a grandchild to me
[15:57:15] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: Have you used pseudo selectors before?
[15:57:21] <enjoycrf> who knows tho maybe jquery has a messed up family
[15:57:36] <enjoycrf> yes i have
[15:57:57] <Eviltwin> So you know .tabs is the ansector and div:first-child is the child
[15:58:14] <enjoycrf> well
[15:58:21] <enjoycrf> .tabs has the divs
[15:58:26] <Eviltwin> ancestor*
[15:58:29] <enjoycrf> so its .tabs:child
[15:58:49] <Eviltwin> What?
[15:59:09] <Eviltwin> .tabs div:first-child effectively finds all .tabs and grabs the first div in each
[15:59:27] <enjoycrf> i guess that makes sense too
[15:59:31] <enjoycrf> but not initialy
[15:59:33] <Eviltwin> That's what it does...
[15:59:39] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: :first-child is a characteristic of something, not an implicit traversal.
[15:59:45] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:59:47] <enjoycrf> ok yeah
[15:59:52] <Moridine> I have to agree I would read that as find the first div inside .tabs
[15:59:54] <Eviltwin> That's how pseudo selectors work
[16:00:09] <enjoycrf> its like a param
[16:00:16] <Eviltwin> <something>:<characteristic>
[16:00:41] <Moridine> wait actually what Eviltwin makes perfect sense
[16:00:48] <Eviltwin> And only if it matches that characteristic does it get selected
[16:01:46] <enjoycrf> hey which was first the egg or the chiken?
[16:01:56] <enjoycrf> ull never kno haha
[16:02:02] <enjoycrf> cause only i kno
[16:02:06] <Eviltwin> "h1 h2:<characteristic>" is some (or all) of the elements from "h1 h2"
[16:02:21] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: Chickens reproduce sexually so it would be the egg
[16:02:34] <Eviltwin> When two very-close-to-chickens mated
[16:02:56] <Eviltwin> And the zygote formed a chicken
[16:02:57] <enjoycrf> thats not the right answer
[16:03:26] <Eviltwin> I have a Ph.D in biology and biochemistry
[16:03:32] <Eviltwin> And I'm telling you, it is the right answer
[16:03:40] <enjoycrf> lol
[16:03:58] <enjoycrf> eggs r smarter
[16:04:33] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: what's the first language you programmed in
[16:05:02] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: AppleScript because I found some lying around on my parents' Mac and thought it was pretty cool
[16:05:06] <ajpiano> ah
[16:05:25] <Eviltwin> When I was like 8 or 9
[16:05:25] <ajpiano> i was curious if you had learned perl in the course of doing biology stuff, i heard it's big there
[16:05:32] <Eviltwin> Oh, I know Perl
[16:05:36] <Eviltwin> And I like Perl
[16:05:37] <ajpiano> heh, hunch confirmed
[16:05:37] <enjoycrf> me2 i started basic wen i was 9
[16:05:52] <enjoycrf> i kno perl too
[16:06:35] <Eviltwin> And I actually haven't taken any bio beside an intro level in high school
[16:06:39] <Haprog> I think I started with Delphi (Object Pascal) when I was 12. Though I learned HTML when I was 11.
[16:06:43] <Eviltwin> I just wanted to settle this chicken & egg thing once for all
[16:06:48] <Eviltwin> So I invented some credentials
[16:07:05] <Eviltwin> once and for all*
[16:07:14] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: lol
[16:07:29] <enjoycrf> i cant hear you :/
[16:07:34] <Moridine> I was wondering what a biochemist would be doing in #jquery :P
[16:08:01] <ajpiano> the DOM gets everyone some day
[16:08:01] <Eviltwin> One web designer I worked with was a Ph.D in Philosophy
[16:08:14] <Eviltwin> He said he enjoyed the web work more
[16:08:20] <Eviltwin> I can't blame him
[16:08:59] <hidensoft> jqueryui have different channel ?
[16:09:00] <enjoycrf> in russia we have computers that run on regular tapes
[16:09:02] <Moridine> I first started programming in AMOS on my Amiga when I was 6 and then moved on to basic
[16:09:07] <Eviltwin> hidensoft: #jqueryui I think
[16:09:15] <enjoycrf> like the tapes u put into a walkman
[16:09:23] <hidensoft> Eviltwin, wrong channel ;)
[16:09:35] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: People still use those in this day and age?
[16:09:51] <enjoycrf> no but when i was 9 i did
[16:10:05] <Eviltwin> No magnetic drive?
[16:10:14] <enjoycrf> no
[16:10:37] <Eviltwin> Tapes still generally have more storage
[16:10:50] <Eviltwin> But rotating magnetic disks and drives are generally faster
[16:10:51] <yogurt_truck> "I love browser scripting and Javascript because of their subjective solipsistic nondualities" - Karl Popper
[16:10:52] <Moridine> and they last longer
[16:11:15] <guy> is there actually any difference in terms of performance, whether I use 'POST' or 'GET' with $.ajax?
[16:11:34] <Eviltwin> guy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST
[16:11:59] <Eviltwin> guy: Not great performance difference but different meanings
[16:12:04] <Eviltwin> And different capabilties
[16:12:39] <enjoycrf> ok guy
[16:12:43] <enjoycrf> here is what i found
[16:12:52] <enjoycrf> always use post vs get
[16:13:04] <guy> so, basically GET idempotent; POST not idempotent?
[16:13:05] <enjoycrf> unles u want to display the get
[16:13:12] <enjoycrf> no
[16:13:19] <enjoycrf> get is visible
[16:13:21] <Moridine> does anyone ever use HTTP DELETE?
[16:13:23] <enjoycrf> post is hiden
[16:13:27] <hidensoft> there is any plugin for element re-sizable except jquery ui ?
[16:13:33] <Eviltwin> guy: In rest, yeah
[16:13:33] <enjoycrf> get has a limit and post does not
[16:13:35] <Eviltwin> REST*
[16:13:49] <Eviltwin> Moridine: Yes, for REST APIs
[16:14:00] <guy> Ok. Going with post. Thank you Eviltwin.
[16:14:14] <enjoycrf> post is generaly more secure
[16:14:28] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: No, it's not more secure
[16:14:31] <enjoycrf> so unless u have specific, user controled
[16:14:36] <enjoycrf> vars use post
[16:14:58] <enjoycrf> get is more of a user moded thing and for google to index
[16:15:13] <Eviltwin> enjoycrf: Not really...
[16:15:22] <enjoycrf> ie mod rewrite
[16:23:08] <solidus-river> how do i check if a certain div exists on the current dom tree?
[16:23:18] <Eviltwin> Like what?
[16:23:25] <Eviltwin> How are you identifying it?
[16:23:42] <solidus-river> i'm using ajax reqeusts to fill in the main content of my site
[16:23:55] <solidus-river> and i have a polling function that updates certain "views" with new data
[16:24:13] <solidus-river> but i dont want to run the poll unless that view is the current view, figured i'd check if it is by seeing if a div that only exists in that view is in the current dom tree
[16:24:30] <solidus-river> so i know how to search for it but i'm not sure how to tell if the search found a div or not
[16:24:37] <solidus-river> well, div, span, li, etc
[16:24:40] <Moridine> $('div').length?
[16:24:46] <solidus-river> identifying by class
[16:24:56] <Moridine> $('div.class').length
[16:25:25] <solidus-river> Moridine: so $('div.class').length will return 0 if the div does not exist or should i check for $('div.class').length > 0
[16:25:48] <Moridine> just do if ($('div.class').length) :)
[16:26:37] <solidus-river> Moridine: cool :)
[16:26:51] <Moridine> :)
[16:28:51] <dougb> is there a function that captures change and keyup/keydown?
[16:29:29] <Moridine> dougb: $(document).keydown(function(e){
[16:29:53] <zi> I find it funny that he asked it with the exact names of functions.
[16:30:26] <dougb> Moridine: zi i was wondering if there a function that captures it all
[16:30:44] <Moridine> oh I see
[16:30:46] <dougb> I guess key up would be the most affective
[16:30:50] <Eviltwin> dougb: $.bind("change keyup keydown",function(){...})
[16:30:59] <dougb> nice
[16:31:00] * Moridine points at what Eviltwin wrote
[16:31:00] <zi> Eviltwin - whoa, awesome.
[16:31:01] <Eviltwin> That captures all 3
[16:31:03] <dougb> thank you Eviltwin
[16:31:14] <Eviltwin> (Probably 3 per keypress that way)
[16:31:19] <Eviltwin> So may not be what you want
[16:31:46] <dougb> it's not going back to the server, so it's not a huge deal
[16:32:30] <AliG1000> Eviltwin: I've JSfiddled it to make it clearer to read   http://jsfiddle.net/J9z9D/    I still don't get an alert when I move the position of the slider.
[16:33:45] <guy> need some help here with jquery logic http://dev.anuary.com/mike-gamaroff/unbreakable-embrace/app/index.php JS file http://dev.anuary.com/mike-gamaroff/unbreakable-embrace/app/public/js/frontend/jquery.carousel.js
[16:34:13] <guy> why once I click on a carousel navigation (top of the screen), LI element CSS is being reset?
[16:34:28] <guy> all I do is move element from one position to another.
[16:35:10] <Eviltwin> AliG1000: There's a bug in the code
[16:35:25] <AliG1000> in the original? or my own?
[16:35:48] <Eviltwin> The jquery.slider-min.js
[16:35:52] <AliG1000> My own is what you see on JSFiddle, the linked files are the original
[16:36:44] <solidus-river> brb, apparently i'm not registered with nickserv for some reason
[16:37:07] <AliG1000> when I press submit (on my own site), the values get passed to the nest page in the 'area1' parameter.  Should I be listening out to that instead?
[16:37:20] <AliG1000> next page
[16:37:22] <guy> anyone?
[16:37:54] <Eviltwin> They do, not sure if the .change() will pick that up
[16:40:36] <AliG1000> Eviltwin: it doesn't appear to make any difference - I'll write to the original coder to see if he has any suggestions.  thank you so much for your input though!
[17:03:02] <AliG1000> http://jsfiddle.net/J9z9D/4/  Got the callback function working for the store hour slider.  Now just have to insert the values into a database via Ajax...
[17:04:39] <enleth> Hi there. Is there *any* cross-browser way of achieving what -moz-element does under FF? I need to make a reflection - but of an entire div with several elements, not a single image. Eye candy only, could be a canvas, but I need to make a "snapshot" of the div in question first.
[17:04:55] <enleth> At the very least under FF and WebKit
[17:13:42] <nnnn> hello?
[17:13:50] <nnnn> any jQuery peepz?
[17:14:54] <Moridine> 812 of them
[17:15:48] <nnnn> I'm kinda new to IRC just joined on the website benalman
[17:16:09] <nnnn> was implementing the BBQ plugin
[17:21:17] <Dave_Stein> nnnn yes and
[17:23:59] <Kamakazi> god knows how many lines of code over the years
[17:24:09] <Kamakazi> and I still forget that second = sign in if statement sometimes
[17:24:33] <Eviltwin> I actually can't say I've ever done that
[17:24:37] <Eviltwin> When I mean it to be a comparison
[17:24:58] <Kamakazi> I don't know why, but I do it all the time
[17:25:34] <Dave_Stein> i havent done that one in ages
[17:25:41] <Dave_Stein> but its a bitch when it causes a bug and youre like wtf everything looks right
[17:25:49] <solidus-river> how do i set data-remote = true using an Ajax call?
[17:25:59] <Eviltwin> What?
[17:26:59] <mutuca> helo
[17:27:15] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: was that at me or someone else?
[17:28:19] <mutuca> Does anyone have a handout jquery?
[17:28:53] <Dave_Stein> mutuca likea getting started thing?
[17:29:02] <mutuca> yes
[17:30:02] <mutuca> i have a lot of troubles with jquery and i'd like to study jquery to resolve that.
[17:30:25] <danzik17> ?101
[17:31:46] <mutuca> Dave_Stein, can you help me? with a handout jquery?
[17:41:15] <janthony> If you have two selectors in your event how do you check which one was clicked, i.e. $(".lightbox-insert-link, .offer-info a").live("click", function(){ - how do I know if .lightbox-insert-offer was clicked or .offer-info a was clicked?
[17:42:45] <Blaster> do basic jQuery things work on iOS or no?
[17:42:57] <Kamakazi> Yep
[17:43:14] <Blaster> cause I did a simple ajax call and change of text and it didn't work on my iphone
[17:43:51] <janthony> Anyone?
[17:44:09] <Kamakazi> Blaster: It seems to work for me.
[17:44:17] <imsky> janthony: several ways, look into event target first
[17:45:29] <holodoc> janthony: Wouldn't accessing this inside the event hanlder be enough?
[17:46:29] <janthony> holodoc: yeah, I'll probably just do if($(this).hasClass()) { } else { } or something
[17:46:36] <riyonuk> I'm quite new to jQuery, but I'm trying to find a library for image effects. The ones where it "cube-ifies" the image, or swirls it. Almost like Microsoft Powerpoint. Anyone know of some? I can't seem to find any.
[17:46:46] <aple> What's the best way to repeatedly test to see if a value has changed???
[17:47:33] <Kamakazi> aple: If it is some kind of input field an event handler would be best
[17:47:47] <Blaster> hmm
[17:48:14] <holodoc> aple: Setting an onchange event?
[17:48:30] <holodoc> aple: Thought it depends from teh elemnt itself
[17:58:07] <Dr4g> Quick Q; will jquery let me apply 2 callbacks against a bind() on the same dom element ?
[17:58:34] <Dr4g> i have $(window).scroll() callback in generic.js (for the nav) and i now want one on a subpage
[17:58:40] <Dr4g> advice pls ?
[17:59:03] <danzik17> Dr4g: Just to two calls to bind - or do you mean you want to overwrite the earlier one?
[18:01:49] <Dr4g> danzik17: no just have two.
[18:08:05] * K1ng cries
[18:08:13] <K1ng> @font-face, you die
[18:09:26] <fourcolors> hi, I have an ul that has a delete button in it. I only want the delete button to appear when i over over a li element in the un ordered list. I have a class called .hide on the delete link and I was wondering how I could some how access just showing and hiding the delete link while hover over the li element ?
[18:10:55] <fourcolors> oh I think i can use the "children" command
[18:11:41] <nylinuxhelp> hi all, I have a jquery mobile application that submits a form. I've tried to turn off AJAX for it, so when I post, the page transitions in a way similar to "rel=external" for hyperlinks.  However, I can't seem to turn off the hashing-style transition
[18:12:02] <riyonuk> K1ng: What's wrong with @font-face :p
[18:12:20] <K1ng> riyonuk, ttf doesnt work in ie :(
[18:12:32] <K1ng> works just fine in chrome and firefox
[18:12:44] <K1ng> http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator doesnt work :(
[18:12:46] <riyonuk> I don't even use that. I use..the w one...I forget :p
[18:12:57] <riyonuk> woff I think>
[18:14:33] <K1ng> WOFF 	Cross-browser, web-only font format that uses gzip compression. IE9+, FF3.6+, Chrome 5+
[18:16:31] <K1ng> riyonuk, how do you convert tiff to woff?
[18:16:53] <riyonuk> K1ng: I don't know, I just use what's available. XD
[18:25:46] <nylinuxhelp> hi all, found the answer, in case anyone might be experiencing the same
[18:25:47] <nylinuxhelp> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/forms/forms-sample.html
[18:26:01] <nylinuxhelp> uses data-ajax ="false" in the FORM tag.
[18:27:16] <nylinuxhelp> now, would anyone know the best way to replace the dull-grey font color of the placeholder text within a form input element type=text?
[18:41:54] <HeathHome> How do I pass multiple variables through ajax using jquery?
[18:42:17] <HeathHome> I tried data: {"pin":$(this).attr('id'),"state":$(this).attr('name')},
[18:42:25] <HeathHome> and it is only showing the first to come though.
[18:46:05] <plov> hi, i'm using jquery auto-complete from jquery-ui, why is it sometimes if i type something for auto complete, for instance "autocomplete" it'll skip and delete characters
[18:47:09] <plov> or for instance if i already have the word "autocomplete" typed in and i begin to delete, hold down backspace, it'll skip and undelete a character, then re-delete it
[18:53:37] <nylinuxhelp> HeathHome, I think I can help
[18:53:51] <HeathHome> mylinuxhelp, yes please
[18:53:52] <nylinuxhelp> are you looking to Post these vars, like a form?
[18:53:57] <HeathHome> Yes
[18:54:07] <nylinuxhelp> I have an example, let me go find it (brb)
[18:54:26] <HeathHome> k
[18:54:55] <HeathHome> http://pastebin.com/SXPFaKax <- my js code
[18:57:12] * HeathHome waits eagerly
[18:57:34] <danzik17> HeathHome: Looks like it should work.  Load up Fiddler and see what's in the request body.  Maybe make sure those  attrs aren't returning undefined
[18:58:07] <HeathHome> danzik17, I have already tried to pass very basic attrs. the first one goes great, the second not so much.
[18:59:23] <Kamakazi> hmm...didn't know iOS didn't support CSS styles that were typeless
[19:01:14] <solidus-river> booooo iOS
[19:01:26] <solidus-river> <- puts blowtorch away
[19:01:31] <danzik17> HeathHome: I've got a feeling it's an issue with your attrs.  Try setting a constant var and not using attr (simply as a test), so replace .attr('id') with 1 and attr('name') with 2.
[19:01:53] <HeathHome> danzik17, I already did that
[19:02:06] <HeathHome> same issue
[19:02:46] <danzik17> HeathHome: And how are you determining that only one val is being sent?  I ask because I just copied and pasted your code locally.  Works fine (except for the 404 response of course)
[19:03:07] <Kamakazi> solidus-river: I don't disagree, but at this stage, has to be supported
[19:03:45] <nylinuxhelp> still loooking. it wasnt where i thought
[19:05:47] <K1ng> firefox 7? is it a joke?
[19:06:18] <nylinuxhelp> just found this on net
[19:06:21] <Dave_Stein> K1ng: it fixes the text ellipses error! haha
[19:06:22] <nylinuxhelp> data: { v1: $('#tb1').val(),
[19:06:22] <nylinuxhelp>             v2: $('#tb2').val(),
[19:06:22] <nylinuxhelp>             v3: $('#tb3').val()
[19:06:22] <nylinuxhelp>         },
[19:06:25] <Dave_Stein> we've been going nuts over here
[19:06:33] <nylinuxhelp> Heath, give that a try, let us know
[19:06:33] <Dave_Stein> cause of that stupid bug
[19:06:46] <K1ng> ah
[19:12:13] <nylinuxhelp> HeathHome, found this also --
[19:12:15] <nylinuxhelp> var myDataObject = {
[19:12:15] <nylinuxhelp>    var1 : value1,
[19:12:15] <nylinuxhelp>    var2 : value2
[19:12:15] <nylinuxhelp> },
[19:12:15] <nylinuxhelp> then at the $.ajax({
[19:12:16] <nylinuxhelp> data : myDataObject
[19:34:30] <huntedmitch> Are there any obvious reasons I can set the value of an input using $('input#ID').attr('value','this value'); but can't retrieve the value using $('input#ID').attr('value');
[19:36:28] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch: you should be using .val for that
[19:36:46] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch, not sure why that weird way wouldnt work offhadn though... i think you'd want to use .prop if you wanted to do something that odd
[19:37:43] <Dave_Stein> and to home i go
[19:40:01] <binaryfus10nz> suggestions on best way to cycle a banner rotation with variables lenghts per banner... ex: 5 sec, 8 sec, 8 sec, 7 sec, etc.
[19:54:22] <killown> Do anyone know a good plugin for shopping cart?
[19:58:59] <huntedmitch> killown: No. :-|
[19:59:25] <killown> ok
[20:29:46] <binaryfus10nz> killown, define shopping cart
[20:29:58] <binaryfus10nz> like "shopping cart" or like some ecomm software platform ?
[20:30:22] <killown> binaryfus10nz, Like that http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/
[20:30:50] <binaryfus10nz> looks cool
[20:30:51] <binaryfus10nz> what about it
[20:31:33] <killown> I would like to know something more beautiful
[20:32:57] <binaryfus10nz> why not customize that/
[20:33:05] <binaryfus10nz> I use magento for ecomm never messed with JS carts
[21:07:41] <huntedmitch> I am having an absolute blank. If I declare a variable, then start a closure and update the variable, then leave the closer it should maintain state right? I mean, I have been poking at this for 5 minutes and I have no idea why the variable is losing state.
[21:10:35] <sabotage> ok, I've asked variations of this question before, but I'm still stuck, so I put together a fiddle to show the problem
[21:10:38] <sabotage> http://jsfiddle.net/DT764/1/
[21:11:37] <sabotage> the situation is this, dragging a draggable from the parent doc into a sortable in an iframe loaded document
[21:15:16] <Eviltwin> sabotage: Doing things across the iframe boundary ranges from difficult to impossible
[21:15:26] <sabotage> so I'm finding
[21:15:55] <sabotage> biggest issue seems to be that connectToSortable does not allow me to pass a context
[21:16:09] <Eviltwin> Look at postMessage
[21:16:40] <sabotage> ewww :(
[21:17:41] <sabotage> so, I'm also gathering that iframeFix really does nothing to help in this case, only solves mouse tracking/offset issues when draggin *over* iframes
[21:17:43] <sabotage> not into them
[21:18:10] <sabotage> actually, not guessing, verified by looking into the sortable.js code
[21:20:08] <sabotage> so... to solve my *real* issue, does anyone have any clever ideas on how to load a doc to be rendered with a different UI (jQM for example) and theme *into* a div such than I can d-n-d into sortables it contains?
[21:21:15] <sabotage> IOW, my goal here is to drag items from the parent doc into a "child" doc while allowing that child doc to use jQM instead of jQ-UI?
[21:27:05] <sabotage> ah, Eviltwin, were you trying to direct me to the postmessage plugin for jQ?
[21:27:43] * sabotage thought you just meant window.postMessage() by "hand"
[21:28:39] <Eviltwin> I meant that that's the only (hopefully soon to be) fully supported way of communicating across that barrier
[21:28:49] <Eviltwin> You can't drag into an iframe, that makes no sense
[21:28:55] <Eviltwin> But you might be able to fake it
[21:29:34] <danzik17> sabotage: http://jsfiddle.net/DT764/2/
[21:29:55] <sabotage> well, it may make no "sense", but it sure would be nice, esp in the case of a locally hosted (non-network dep) "application"
[21:30:45] <Eviltwin> Ha ha ha ha
[21:30:51] <Eviltwin> They have one of those giant centipedes in this
[21:31:04] <Eviltwin> The ones that can kill people
[21:31:24] <sabotage> danzik17: ok, closer, maybe workable for what I need
[21:31:34] <sabotage> worth a try at least, thanks!
[21:31:40] <Eviltwin> Still can't drag out
[21:31:53] <sabotage> Eviltwin: don't need to in my case
[21:32:06] <sabotage> basically I jus tneed to place items from a "palette"
[21:32:46] <danzik17> Eviltwin: Not going to implement it, but if you can get the position "outside" of the iframe  your working in, then sure you can - just do what I did going the other direction
[21:35:04] <sabotage> ah, crumb, I see I pasted my js with bogus connectToSortable by mistake... that was never going to work :/
[21:45:54] <Aristata> Anyone know of a good plugin that can take a ul and scroll it up or down based on where the mouse is hovering on the list?
[21:48:24] <noobie25> i'd like to separate each of my form elements placed in a div container.  The functionality i'd like to each is that each form element is shown in the div container ... much like a lightbox image slider (with next prev buttons) and ultimately "submits" the form at the end.  Is there a particular library that can help me with this?
[21:48:59] <noobie25> Basically, I'd like to walk the user with a step by step form .... rather than showing 1 big form.
[22:14:38] <shashilo> Need help. I have Div fields that I want to change to Li's
[22:15:19] <coldhead> ?unwrap @ shashilo
[22:15:19] <bot-t> shashilo, .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[22:15:26] <coldhead> ?wrap @ shashilo
[22:15:26] <bot-t> shashilo, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[22:16:41] <shashilo> @coldhead that may just work!
[22:26:18] <huntedmitch> I know I can use .delay() to place a delay between two events that are linked, but what about two separate statements? I just need something to wait about .5 seconds for an API response, the problem is that the API is closed and I can't tell it to wait for the return so i have to force it to just delay instead.
[22:26:33] <huntedmitch> Hey coldhead  btw
[22:26:36] <huntedmitch> <-- bananasontoast
[22:26:55] <coldhead> hey huntedmitch !
[22:27:14] <coldhead> huntedmitch: you have to use setTimeout for that
[22:28:56] <huntedmitch> coldhead: Like this? setTimeout(sp.trackPlayer.PlayTrackFromURL($(this).attr('href')), 500);
[22:29:17] <coldhead> need to wrap it in a function () {}
[22:29:38] <coldhead> setTimeout(function () {sp.trackPlayer.PlayTrackFromURL($(this).attr('href'))}, 500);
[22:31:30] <huntedmitch> Hmmm, didn't work...
[22:33:29] <killown> binaryfus10nz, I am making a ERP system and I need a shopping cart jquery plugin with a clean api
[22:35:05] <futini> $(this + ".class") dont work
[22:35:18] <Bower^> http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=album.search&album=believe&api_key=b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026 - can someone please try accessing that and refresh the page a few times. do you ever receive time outs?
[22:36:17] <coldhead> ack, huntedmitch, you are probably losing the `this`
[22:36:31] <coldhead> try var that = this; before the fn and then use that inside the setTimeout
[22:37:25] <huntedmitch> Ahah, cool
[22:39:04] <huntedmitch> Yeah worked, thanks man
[22:39:40] <Spadeski> Sup everyone Can I get some advice ?
[22:39:53] <huntedmitch> Don't ask to ask :-)
[22:40:30] <futini> any help whit this please, http://jsfiddle.net/ztKUd/ i cant select the sub item fine, please :)
[22:40:38] <Spadeski> :D Ok well lets say I have5 photos that are drag and drop and now i want to make it so when i drag it to a certain image holder in the top left i want it too change the profile picture in the mysql
[22:46:58] <Spadeski> anyone?
[22:47:42] <huntedmitch> So you're using droppable?
[22:48:16] <huntedmitch> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[22:50:05] <huntedmitch> Spadeski: ?
[22:51:07] <Spadeski> huntedmitch yes
[22:51:21] <Spadeski> or sortable w/e you wanna call it
[22:52:44] <huntedmitch> You can just use the use .bind("drop", function(event, ui) { /*  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ */ }); to do an update
[22:53:00] <Spadeski> Dude Thanks Alot that was perfect
[22:53:17] <huntedmitch> Sure, np
[22:54:17] <Spadeski> huntedmitch huntedmitch may I pm if ya dont mind ?
[22:54:44] <huntedmitch> Just here is fine if that's okay
[22:54:58] <Spadeski> No problem
[22:54:58] <huntedmitch> I'm actually working so it's easier just to keep the chan for chat
[22:55:22] <Spadeski> Oh thats cool what do you do ?
[22:56:03] <huntedmitch> I work for a small tech startup as a front-end web developer

[23:01:06] <huntedmitch> Not right now thanks :-)
[23:01:32] <Spadeski> No problem checkout gotactics.net when you can my site<< :D
[23:01:43] <TheCode> Wonder what this is not being caught: "html '<b>HI</b>'".match(/html\s+ '/);
[23:01:57] <TheCode> As far as I know, ' is not a special char
[23:02:25] <Spadeski> you have '/
[23:02:30] <Spadeski> it should be /'
[23:02:53] <TheCode> that will close the regex prematurely
[23:03:01] <TheCode> you mean \'?
[23:03:08] <Spadeski> yeah i see that now
[23:03:21] <Aristata> This is a longshot but the googlemaps irc is dead dead: What is the "control" that lets you click and grab/drag the map? Is it possible to enable this and disable it based on the zoom of the map?
[23:03:23] <TheCode> even \' does not work
[23:03:26] <Aristata> ^ google maps
[23:03:52] <Spadeski> tehCode the problem is you have a ' with no closer so idk what to do there
[23:04:36] <TheCode> there should be solution to that, i think
[23:05:05] <Spadeski> yeah thats what i was thinkin add a / in front of the ' and it shouldturn it to ascii or w/e it does
[23:08:50] <Spadeski> huntedmitch That was great example thanks I make them send the listitems to the php page now I need to make the php update into the mysql I have it list the itmes in a foreach as the order of there id which is lisitem_x where x is 1-4 how would i make them update and save positions if you mindsharing
[23:10:30] <mblitz> Hi, I have a problem with  jQuery-UI dragable revert. The first time it reverts it does not move to its old position where left, but jumps out of the top right corner of the page. the second time it fits nice to its constraining layer.
[23:33:20] <compact> http://www.irchorseracing.net/new/index2.php?page=horse_vacant
[23:33:35] <compact> any idea why when i click on a header, EG: Starts
[23:33:39] <compact> it all goes?
[23:34:13] <TheCode> is there a jquery plugin that handles cursor position in text box?
[23:35:37] <Spadeski> TheCode If you get that please do share
[23:35:43] <Bower^> What's a good timeout value for ajax requests?
[23:35:51] <TheCode> hmm
[23:35:52] <Bower^> one second too little?
[23:36:19] <TheCode> depends on your job
[23:38:07] <compact> well it works, but not on first page
[23:38:15] <compact> if i change option it doers
[23:42:06] <axscode> hi guys, how to css, position: fixed, which is 300 going right from center of page?
[23:44:11] <mblitz> Can someone please help me? I have a problem with  jQuery-UI dragable revert. The first time it reverts it does not move to its old position where left, but jumps out of the top right corner of the page. the second time it fits nice to its constraining layer.
[23:51:52] <Bower^> Have FF sorted out their issue of being unable to handle the aborting of ajax requests once the <script> tag has been appended?
[23:51:53] <coldhead> axscode: you probably have to use $(window).width() and so some arithmetic to find the correct position
[23:52:03] <coldhead> and update in the $(window).resize() handler
[23:52:15] <coldhead> does anyone here speak thai? you thais are hilarious
[23:52:53] <axscode> can i do the the body portion?
[23:53:04] <axscode> can i do that inside the body? or should be in  head?
[23:53:08] <Spadeski> coldhead way to get color of a pixel on the screen with mouse point ... go
[23:53:11] <Spadeski> lol
[23:53:35] <coldhead> in the body is okay by me, axscode
[23:53:43] <dytrivedi> .seen iszak
[23:53:46] <coldhead> Spadeski: i know that's possible but i'd have to ask google how
[23:53:46] <hsbot> iszak was seen 10 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[23:53:48] <axscode> ok
[23:54:00] <dytrivedi> sup coldhead. long time no see?
[23:54:06] <axscode> this is before or after the tag i want to position?
[23:54:11] <Spadeski> coldhead tried couldnt get anything maybe wrong keywords?
[23:54:12] <coldhead> i don't know you do i dytrivedi ?
[23:54:32] <coldhead> Spadeski: no, now that i think about it, it's probably not possible
[23:54:32] <dytrivedi> probably not. IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY USING JQUERY.
[23:54:42] <coldhead> wait HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT DYTRIVEDI
[23:54:46] <Spadeski> lol
[23:55:00] <dytrivedi> I can read irc nicks.
[23:55:10] <dytrivedi> like I can read faces.
[23:55:29] <dytrivedi> yours sound like first day using jquery.
[23:55:53] <axscode> #jquery, or jquery itself?
[23:56:02] <Eviltwin> <div id="jquery"></div>
[23:56:05] <coldhead> both
[23:56:07] <Eviltwin> <jquery></jquery>
[23:56:20] <coldhead> i would hardly have joined #jQUery if i wasn't using jQuery
