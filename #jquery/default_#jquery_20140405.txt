[00:05:53] <CrowX-> I tried implementing an on load event to fire every time an image's src is changed, but it only worked the first time
[00:06:18] <CrowX-> I tried creating a temporary image and replacing the current with it, and that only gives me one additional firing tie
[00:06:19] <CrowX-> time*
[00:28:47] <Parsi> i'm using chosen plugin and qtip (integrated with validation), qtip does not show tooltip in the right place for chosen enabled dropdown. http://jsfiddle.net/maysamsh/rLQDK/42/ here is the whole code
[00:32:54] <unnu> hey, is it possible to select an element by its text?
[00:34:19] <unnu> perhaps i should ask a better question : if i have a unordered list, what is the best way to trigger a click event on a specific li? by giving it a class / id and using .click or no?
[00:37:53] <Parsi> unnu: add a class name or an unique id to that li
[00:38:30] <Parsi> then handle click like this $("#my_list_id").on("click",function(){//foo code});
[00:44:45] <unnu> Parsi, any easy way to save all of the li's to an array?
[00:45:22] <Parsi> unnu: wanan do the same action for all li's?
[00:50:04] <fattest> I need help with select with jquery. If you click on the main box, it should alert something instead of triggering the drop down box. is this possible? http://jsfiddle.net/vWLEn/318/
[01:03:02] <fattest> is it possible to submit the form with the dropdown buttons as well as the search button? http://jsfiddle.net/MN5P8/9/
[01:09:02] <Parsi> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/maysamsh/MN5P8/12/
[01:09:28] <Parsi> i changed of items to "click me"
[01:09:34] <Parsi> that does what u want
[01:36:02] <hxm> hi
[01:36:18] <hxm> exists an irc log viewer online made in jquery that works?
[03:08:08] <fattest> how do i use an 'or' in this statement? $("#myid").on("click",function(){ as in if myid is clicked or myid2 is clicked
[03:10:13] <beancurd> use a comma.
[03:10:36] <beancurd> $("#myid1, #myid2").on( ...
[03:12:27] <fattest> beancurd: thank you very much!
[03:16:21] <fattest> beancurd: do you know how to pass data when i submit the form. I'm trying to get it to work with multiple options for the user to post the same form, but i need to know which button the user clicked to submit thie form. http://codepad.viper-7.com/OxeE6p
[03:20:31] <beancurd> right.
[03:22:06] <beancurd> i have no idea how your pastebin thing works hah.
[03:22:56] <sakoo> post button_id  either
[03:24:09] <fattest> beancurd: http://codepad.viper-7.com/jS983c simple version sakoo
[03:24:41] <fattest> beancurd: i just need to know, when the form submits, which button is pressed
[03:25:48] <beancurd> ok, so if you go by the name of the button, inside your on('click', function ... do the following, $(this).attr('name') <- this will give you the name of the button clicked.
[03:26:12] <beancurd> then you can just set the value of a hidden field somewhere in your form to the name of the button. then submit that.
[03:26:27] <sakoo> create input with hidden type ,while btn click , set input value as btn id
[03:27:05] <beancurd> sakoo: you have very interesting comma placement.
[03:29:45] <fattest> beancurd: http://codepad.viper-7.com/NpU4Mu do you think this is efficent method?
[03:33:28] <fattest> beancurd: i think this is more better http://codepad.viper-7.com/j6uANd (using a class)
[03:34:36] <beancurd> looks like it's working?
[03:43:44] <fattest> beancurd: yes it is
[03:43:58] <fattest> beancurd: thank you so much
[03:43:59] <beancurd> :D
[03:44:01] <beancurd> np
[03:44:17] <beancurd> whatcha' making?
[03:44:32] <fattest> LoL APi
[03:44:54] <beancurd> like a character database?
[03:44:59] <beancurd> for stats / etc.
[03:45:05] <fattest> stats
[03:45:19] <beancurd> sweet.
[03:45:19] <fattest> beancurd: but it will also show basic info about champions if user puts mouse over it
[03:45:29] <fattest> beancurd: you play LoL?
[03:45:55] <beancurd> pretty cool. nope, but i know about the game. i played dota2 for a couple of months during the beta, it was fun.
[03:46:06] <fattest> oh yah
[03:47:16] <beancurd> i suppose they're fairly similar games, you get lanes, creep and heros. click stuff kill stuff.
[03:47:42] <fattest> yes
[03:47:53] <fattest> beancurd: I'm experiencing another difficulty
[03:48:16] <beancurd> ?
[03:48:43] <fattest> beancurd: it doesn't work when they are <a> i only used button as an example. do you know how i can fix this? http://codepad.viper-7.com/e48pdq
[03:53:26] <fattest> beancurd: do you have any idea to fix this?
[03:56:36] <unnu> alright: if i wanted to create an array seperated by regex hits, is there an easy way to do this in javascript
[03:56:48] <beancurd> just got myself a coffee :D
[03:56:51] <beancurd> what'd i miss.
[03:57:07] <beancurd> unnu: regex hits?
[03:58:13] <unnu> EG if i have "this.is a . string with . some . dots" the array would be [this][.][is a ][.][string with ][.][ some ][.][dots]  if my expression hit all \. 's
[03:59:09] <unnu> i am awful at correct jargon / venacular syntax as i have taught myself most all the code i know. and most places don't say "this is called __________" they just say "here is how to do this"
[03:59:12] <fattest> beancurd: i need it to work with links....
[03:59:17] <fattest> beancurd: http://codepad.viper-7.com/e48pdq
[03:59:21] <unnu> i appologize
[03:59:41] <beancurd> right, let me have alook at fattest's thing.
[04:00:00] <beancurd> unnu: all cool bro, that's what places like this are for
[04:00:13] <beancurd> beats submitting something on a forum and waiting ages.
[04:00:19] <unnu> lol
[04:00:22] <unnu> thanks beancurd
[04:06:01] <beancurd> kekekeke
[04:06:01] <puchacz> hi guys, is it legal to have string containing any characters in value of input type hidden?
[04:06:17] <beancurd> fattest: http://codepad.viper-7.com/ck2Biu
[04:06:29] <puchacz> I mean, providing a library carries out proper escaping and encoding
[04:06:35] <puchacz> newlines, etc.
[04:07:50] <fattest> beancurd: thank you, but why doesn't it just work with <a>
[04:08:35] <beancurd> well, jquery wasn't included in the other examples, so it was working earlier because the form was getting submitted by the button clicked..
[04:08:43] <beancurd> which was amusing.
[04:09:22] <fattest> beancurd: so there is no alternative without using hidden inputput?
[04:10:05] <fattest> beancurd: how about <a onclick="function"> ?
[04:10:18] <fattest> will that work?
[04:10:21] <beancurd> to me it seems like a logical solution, because then you'll be able to do validation on the hidden input also.
[04:11:28] <fattest> beancurd: will it work with <li>? my <a hrefs are wrapped in <li></li>
[04:12:08] <beancurd> you'll want to change your selector to 'li a' but yeah, it should still work.
[04:15:00] <beancurd> unnu: http://jsfiddle.net/R7azp/1/ is that what you were after?
[04:17:18] <unnu> not actually beancurd, i wanted the text in the array too
[04:17:37] <beancurd> you mean the text as well as the period(.)?
[04:17:41] <unnu> yes
[04:18:23] <beancurd> so.. you want to split by spaces?
[04:18:50] <unnu> the application here is that i can create a "map" of all the formatting tags in a selection using regex similar to [<]\/?[a-zA-z]+[>] or something to that effect
[04:19:25] <unnu> so i need the tags to be their own element of the array
[04:19:37] <unnu> and the text to be their own element of the array
[04:19:38] <fattest> beancurd: http://codepad.viper-7.com/wqfpxe i changed my selector to li a but still no difference... sigh
[04:20:42] <beancurd> unnu: do you have this on a jsfiddle somewhere?
[04:22:05] <beancurd> fattest: you gotta include jquery, otherwise your js won't work, also you got some syntax errors :/
[04:22:17] <beancurd> well, your js will work, but no jquery.
[04:23:11] <fattest> beancurd: http://codepad.viper-7.com/yklQkY
[04:23:23] <fattest> jquery is added now, still no effect
[04:28:56] <beancurd> http://codepad.viper-7.com/X7SSgN
[04:29:01] <beancurd> fattest: ^
[04:29:38] <fattest> beancurd: allow me try this
[04:31:45] <fattest> beancurd: thank you so much for your time
[04:31:50] <beancurd> np
[04:33:04] <unnu> beancurd, you think i am barking up the wrong tree, or no?
[04:33:27] <unnu> because this is something i want to get done soon, but i am having TONS of troubles with this one little function
[04:33:58] <beancurd> unnu: so you have an string, in it are xml tags, and you want to do what with them?
[04:35:14] <unnu> beancurd: i have a string, in it is mixed html. I want to desginate what tags the "selected" html (a small section of said html) is incapsulated within. for this, i was thinking of creating an array, matching each open tag to a close tag and then going from there
[04:36:12] <unnu> ex: <b> this is <i> a rather messy </b> bit of </i> html                             if i select "bit of" it needs to close the <i> tag before the word bit, but not do anything with the <b> tag
[04:36:44] <unnu> however if i were to select "a rather messy" it needs to close the <b> tag and then open an <i> tag afterwards
[04:36:49] <Jattenalle> unnu, pretty sure that's invalid html
[04:37:11] <beancurd> Jattenalle: yeah, but that's beside the point i suppose
[04:37:19] <Jattenalle> oh
[04:37:40] <decx> you're just polishing a turd then, fix html, don't bother creating workarounds
[04:37:51] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/y57mE/
[04:40:44] <beancurd> so.. you want to turn '<b> xyz <i> xyz </b> xyz </i>' into '<b> xyz <i> xyz</i> </b><i> xyz </i>'?
[04:40:50] <beancurd> i'm really confused right now.
[04:42:05] <unnu> beancurd: i am using the selected text
[04:42:13] <unnu> so imagine i have a BOLD button
[04:42:16] <unnu> i select the text
[04:42:22] <unnu> click the bold button
[04:42:24] <unnu> the text bolds
[04:42:32] <beancurd> yep. i get that.
[04:42:32] <unnu> (html5 content editable)
[04:42:55] <unnu> but now i need to select the middle of a string and unbold a bit
[04:43:13] <unnu> so i need to figure out 1: is the text selected bolded?
[04:43:30] <Jattenalle> ooh, i see what you want to do now unnu, makes sense.. i have no idea how to do it in an easy way though
[04:43:31] <unnu> 2: if so, do i only need 1 closing tag?
[04:43:55] <unnu> sorry Jattenalle: like i told beancurd, i have trouble explaining what is in my head
[04:44:03] <unnu> lol
[04:44:12] <beancurd> hah, ok i get what you're trying to do now.
[04:44:27] <Jattenalle> as soon as you said "bold button" it made sense, you basically mean you have a "rich text editor" and you're trying to make it work when the user does stupid shit
[04:44:36] <unnu> EXACTLY
[04:44:44] <unnu> because users are stupid :P
[04:44:48] <Jattenalle> yes, yes they are :3
[04:45:13] <decx> every inline editor has excemptions to prevent creation of invalid html
[04:45:23] <unnu> ?
[04:45:41] <decx> you shouldn't even end up with messy html like that
[04:45:51] <unnu> o
[04:45:52] <unnu> okay
[04:46:20] <unnu> so i have to make an HTML (good word for code cleaner uper)
[04:47:28] <beancurd> quick google yields this.
[04:47:31] <beancurd> https://code.google.com/p/jquery-clean/
[04:48:17] <decx> that's still salvaging after the fact
[04:48:22] <decx> why is that bad html even created
[04:48:38] <unnu> i was trying to avoid creating the bad html
[04:48:56] <decx> if i mark a section of tags between tags, then the editor should notice that
[04:49:00] <unnu> but i am having troubles figuring out a smart way to rap the tags
[04:49:10] <decx> not just put start and end tags before and after the selection
[04:49:13] <unnu> wrap*
[04:49:18] <unnu> i know decx
[04:49:40] <decx> section of text*
[04:52:17] <puchacz> hi, there is something in dialogs' content styling that makes links look like ordinary text. can I revert to default look somehow pls?
[04:52:34] <decx> unnu i'm pretty sure people building wysiwyg editors have spent thousands of man hours to solve that problem. you won't be finding a quick solution is my guess
[04:53:00] <decx> apart from just cleaning up bad html afterwards
[04:53:31] <unnu> :/
[04:53:33] <unnu> that sucks
[04:54:39] <decx> why don't you build on one of the many textarea/contenteditable solutions
[04:55:17] <puchacz> sorry, it is not jquery, it is bootstrap
[04:56:00] <beancurd> puchacz: that sounds like a css thing?
[04:56:02] <unnu> decx: started building my own
[04:56:41] <puchacz> beancurd: correct, just checked in "inspect element", text-decoration: none
[04:56:51] <beancurd> yep.
[04:57:03] <beancurd> a winner is you!
[04:57:35] <decx> the guardian published one two weeks ago unnu check their sourcecode for pointers http://guardian.github.io/scribe/
[04:59:10] <unnu> lots of code but i will pour through it. thanks decx
[04:59:30] <beancurd> so.. what's everyone working on?
[05:00:22] <decx> unnu it's well commented so it will be a benefit working through it, if you wnat to create your own
[05:00:51] <unnu> mine has a decent skeleton, just need to fix my tag wrapping
[05:05:08] <puchacz> beancurd: it is jquery-ui after all, this line: .ui-widget-content a
[05:05:35] <puchacz> text-decoration: none is from bootstrap, and it is ok. but this line from jquery-ui sets color to almost black
[05:05:39] <puchacz> and links do not stand out
[05:06:12] <decx> well change it then?
[05:07:20] <puchacz> decx: can I override it in my files locally?
[05:07:36] <puchacz> I don't want to remember to change it in jquery every time I upgrade it
[05:07:39] <decx> don't change library files
[05:08:12] <puchacz> decx: does the css specs say that I can define something like .ui-widget-content a many times and the last one counts?
[05:08:22] <decx> make a custom.css
[05:08:34] <decx> you can override css as many times as you like
[05:08:43] <puchacz> ok, does the last one count only?
[05:08:51] <decx> if the selector is the same yes
[05:08:56] <puchacz> ok, thanks
[05:09:02] <puchacz> this solves my problem
[05:24:57] <hxm> guys,i confused
[05:25:10] <hxm> for make an ajax request, what method is correct? the success: or the .done() ?
[05:27:08] <decx> done is the newer standardized way to do callbacks
[05:27:23] <hxm> then success will be deprecated some day
[05:28:33] <decx> in the distant future probably
[07:05:29] <Jemt> Hi, I'm using the jQuery UI Dialog to present images in a pop-up window. Is it possible to have the dialog plugin preserve aspect ratio when resizing ?
[07:14:49] <Jattenalle> Jemt, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3057260/jquery-dialog-with-constant-aspect-ratio
[07:14:55] <Jattenalle> first result when googling
[07:18:03] <learning> can u ask jquery mobile questions here ?
[07:19:00] <BillCriswell> learning: They never seem to go too well, but you can try.
[07:19:23] <learning> i will be glad to go to another channel if there is one for just mobile
[07:19:25] <learning> :)
[07:20:00] <learning> anyhow it's a simple question i guess i just need to know how to add a href link to an new page
[07:20:20] <learning> by new page i mean open it inside a div container
[07:20:39] <Jemt> Thanks
[07:21:44] <BillCriswell> learning: So you want to load a new page that has a link that doesn't have a url in the href attribute then add it?
[07:22:35] <learning> no it gets an url from the feed
[07:22:41] <learning> BillCriswell: my code http://pastebin.com/05X4hqhp
[07:22:54] <learning> i tried adding an div id
[07:23:07] <learning> and then load that but did not get it too work
[07:23:36] <learning> hint the id as u can see is newpage
[07:24:57] <BillCriswell> learning: You're putting the same id on all those links. You can't do that, you'd have to use a class.
[07:25:31] <learning> but BillCriswell only one of the id in short is always active seaing as u can only click on link
[07:25:34] <learning> put ok
[07:25:39] <learning> i will add it to a class
[07:26:21] <BillCriswell> learning: I'm sorry I'm kind of lost.
[07:28:03] <learning> BillCriswell: let me know what exactly you lost me on ?
[07:28:20] <learning> on my code*
[07:29:10] <learning> step 1: get link step 2 when link is pressed open that link in a new jquery mobile page AKA div so i can add a back button etc.
[07:29:18] <learning> easier to understand that ?
[07:29:24] <BillCriswell> learning: Much easier.
[07:30:06] <learning> BillCriswell: as of now when i press my links the open in safari etc
[07:30:14] <learning> they*
[07:31:54] <BillCriswell> learning: Are you trying to load another site into a div?
[07:32:16] <learning> yeah i belive that is what i want
[07:33:31] <BillCriswell> learning: So let's say your feed has like google.com, you want to load google.com into a div on the page you're on?
[07:33:40] <learning> yeah!
[07:33:44] <learning> thats correct
[07:33:59] <BillCriswell> You can't do that.
[07:34:04] <learning> or rather when you
[07:34:09] <learning> click on the link google.com
[07:34:56] <Joey__> IE is doing the print preview perfectly, and FF is messing it up... I would normally expect the other way arround
[07:34:59] <learning> i know it can be done cause an jquery mobile app on app store is doing exactly this
[07:35:37] <learning> when the link a is pressed it opens up inside the app but in it's own div or iframe what ever u call it
[07:35:48] <learning> so u can add a go back button etc
[07:36:07] <BillCriswell> Joey__: I've run into so many issues with Firefox printing.
[07:36:57] <BillCriswell> learning: Not sure how much more helpful I'll be here.
[07:37:07] <BillCriswell> I want some mozarella sticks.
[07:37:15] <learning> :(
[07:37:36] <learning> can i explain it better is that the problem ?
[07:37:52] <Joey__> seems like IE isn't printing background color #FFFFFF... that's taking not printing bg colors a bit far
[07:39:58] <BillCriswell> learning: You can't load an external site without the right cross origin resource headers.
[07:41:02] <learning> BillCriswell: but that is passed along via the rss feed
[07:41:24] <Joey__> so I have a div that hides what is underneath it (elements that overlap) is there any trick in the book that I could apply to hide those things on paper as well ?
[07:41:56] <Jemt> It seems the Dialog plugin recreates iFrames if contain in the element transformed to a dialog. Is there some way to prevent that?
[07:42:28] <BillCriswell> learning: It's just passing a link I thought?
[07:44:28] <learning> BillCriswell: load() has pagecontainer that passes the link into a div container
[07:44:33] <learning> docs..
[07:44:52] <learning> but not sure how to implement it :/
[07:47:36] <learning> anyhow i will take up this question again in a while need some food in me! :D
[07:47:38] <learning> ;)
[07:47:48] <BillCriswell> learning: You can do $('#div-that-loads-content').load('/local-file.html #some-div-on-local-file'); but that won't work on an external site.
[07:48:06] <jcool> I was trying to achieve something. I was thinking if we can generate draggable objects on runtime according to dropdown.I dont know where to look from. needed some guidance on same.dont need code just a guidance to approach same.
[07:50:47] <BillCriswell> Joey__: So you have some things stacked with white backgrounds?
[07:52:55] <BillCriswell> Joey__: And that's how you're relying on them being hidden?
[07:59:13] <Joey__> BillCriswell I asked this in #css but no response: I have a div with a border radius, and there are lines I have underneath it that I want to obscure. On screen I can use background color, this works for printing in FF as well.... but not for printing in IE 9. Anyone know something that might do the trick? Screenshot here, the top is the printpreview of IE, the bottom part is how it is on the
[07:59:13] <Joey__> screen. http://i61.tinypic.com/9hp3i9.jpg
[08:00:24] <BillCriswell> Joey__: Ah I see.
[08:02:09] <BillCriswell> Joey__: Is printing with backgroung images ok?
[08:02:51] <BillCriswell> The only way that's coming to mind would be .ie9 .circle { background-image: url("white1x1.png"); }
[08:02:54] <Joey__> I was thinking a 1x1 pixel thing, but that would probably not print it
[08:03:42] <Joey__> another way would be to have an inner div in the circle with a white border I think, dunno
[08:04:11] <BillCriswell> I'd try the white PNG first since it's a pretty quick fix.
[08:04:36] <BillCriswell> Do the circles have a z-index? Wonder if giving them a z-index would make IE think like "hey, it's above something. better give it a background"
[08:04:56] <Joey__> IE has a "print background picture and colors" checkbox that is off by default
[08:05:07] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:05:15] <Joey__> I could probably get away with making my icon png's white instead of transparant
[08:05:57] <Joey__> and make them larger, and use overflow hidden or something
[08:20:16] <decx> print & complicated css is only going to end in pain and suffering
[08:20:45] <decx> much more sane to create a pdf
[08:31:38] <Joey__> decx I don't need the paper layout, but I do want the page to somewhat be representable on paper
[08:37:25] <jrockjiggz> what does jQuery.length; //2 mean?
[08:38:21] <jrockjiggz> jQuery[0] //undefined
[08:38:26] <jrockjiggz> jQuery[1] //undefined
[08:38:45] <beancurd> what does anything mean really :/
[08:38:49] <beancurd> what is life.
[08:39:51] <BillCriswell> What is life.
[08:40:01] <jrockjiggz> Life is a process of dynamic renewal.
[08:40:05] <beancurd> what is love
[08:40:15] <BillCriswell> That's going to be stuck in my head now.
[08:40:21] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: Where are you seeing htat?
[08:40:25] <jrockjiggz> console.
[08:40:29] <beancurd> baby don't hurt me.
[08:40:36] <jrockjiggz> jQuery.length; //2
[08:40:41] <beancurd> baby don't hurt me.
[08:41:11] <beancurd> jrockjiggz: gonna need more contenxt, length usually returns the number of occurances for a particular thing.
[08:41:45] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: I have no idea where that lenght comes from?
[08:42:03] <jrockjiggz> i'm asking what it might mean.. that, two instances of jQuery exist?
[08:42:03] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21711785/why-does-jquery-length-2
[08:42:21] <BillCriswell> It returns how many arguments the function expects.
[08:42:38] <jrockjiggz> ohh, very cool, awesome thx
[08:42:45] <BillCriswell> (function(a,b,c){ }).length
[08:42:48] <BillCriswell> is 3.
[08:42:53] <BillCriswell> Never knew that...
[08:42:55] <jrockjiggz> ?eval (function(a,b,c){ }).length
[08:43:17] <jrockjiggz> cool, might be very useful
[08:43:24] <jrockjiggz> i can see it being useful
[08:44:14] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: I'm trying to think of when but drawing a blank... I'm not the most advanced programmer in the world either.
[08:45:58] <jrockjiggz> if(obj.length == func.length){ function(obj){} }
[08:46:11] <jrockjiggz> >=
[08:47:19] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: I think it makes more sense for the function to handle that?
[08:47:51] <BillCriswell> I'd rather a function throw an error at me for the wrong number of arguments than now run at all.
[08:48:10] <jrockjiggz> correct.
[08:48:54] <BillCriswell> I'm going to go find mozzarella sticks.
[08:48:58] <BillCriswell> Have a good one!
[08:49:30] <decx> that's what my mom says when she's searching for the browser on the desktop
[08:49:42] <decx> where's the mozzarella
[09:03:48] <Joey__> any case anyone is wondering, I used a div with a thick white border, and then used a negative margin to place the image above it, that fakes a white background, hiding the elements underneath
[09:04:10] <beancurd> nice.
[09:31:09] <jcool> can we check response that will get generated after selecting particular items in selectable.?
[09:43:53] <Garth> Hey! I have a quick newbie question! If I call a function, and in that function want to use event.data.my_var, what is event.data.my_var set to if I never initialize and pass my_var with the event handler?
[09:45:40] <Cork> Garth: event.data is undefined if you never set a data in the event handler
[09:45:45] <Cork> same for variables on the object
[09:47:08] <Garth> So if I want to make a check to see if it is not set, I just do if (event.data.my_var === 'undefined') {}
[09:47:33] <Cork> undefined, not 'undefined'
[09:48:06] <Cork> js> var a = {}; print(a.not_here === undefined);
[09:48:13] <b-ot> Cork: true
[09:48:36] <Cork> js> var a = { not_here: 'not true!' }; print(a.not_here === undefined);
[09:48:41] <b-ot> Cork: false
[09:48:52] <Garth> thanks! Cork++
[09:51:25] <CarlFK> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/ is there a good place to ask "how do I make panels stay open?"
[09:52:08] <CarlFK> I am thinking I could make each one it's own accordion.  for some reason that bothers me and I was hoping there is a setting
[09:52:32] <CarlFK> also hoping for "open all"
[09:52:43] <Cork> CarlFK: you could use just the css from accoridon and create your own static element
[09:53:04] <Cork> CarlFK: accordion doesn't support having more then one open at the time
[09:53:07] <body> i have to build a nav like this, what's the name for, so i can google for it http://i.imgur.com/I87uUrn.png
[09:53:31] <Cork> body: tabs?
[09:53:46] <CarlFK> Cork: thanks -
[09:54:04] <drej> [12:53:50]  <drej>	 tabs?
[09:54:04] <drej> lol
[09:54:12] <drej> he spammed the same thing in at least 4 other channels
[09:54:17] <Cork> lol
[09:54:28] <Cork> body: also, only ask in one channel at a time
[09:54:48] <Cork> that reminds me i need to fix my channel summary script
[09:55:31] <Cork> uh, *plugin
[09:55:34] <hxm> if I pass an array to json and want to read I in jquery how to get the equivalent [0]?
[09:55:54] <Cork> hxm: pass and array to json?
[09:56:07] <Cork> hxm: you mean as json?
[09:56:07] <body> Cork uh, srry i didn't know that about asking in one channel
[09:56:11] <hxm> the array is this http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6NhG7tpp
[09:56:15] <hxm> yes as json
[09:56:24] <hxm> i want to parse that
[09:56:36] <Cork> hxm: also that isn't json
[09:56:44] <Cork> thats objects in a js file
[09:56:57] <hxm> i did it with json_encode in php
[09:57:05] <hxm> ok I can go ahead now
[09:57:08] <CarlFK> hxm: do you want to parse the "var servers" part, or the stuff to the right of =
[09:57:11] <Cork> hxm: ya, but that just helps you generate the object
[09:57:26] <hxm> ah, ah
[09:57:39] <Cork> servers["irc.chathispano.com"]["#psicologia"][n]
[09:57:46] <Cork> where n is the number in the array
[09:57:53] <shoky> JSON.parse(servers)
[09:58:01] <hxm> and how to get the servername servers[0]?
[09:58:03] <Cork> ah
[09:58:20] <Cork> hxm: you would have to know them
[09:58:30] <hxm> ah
[09:58:34] <Cork> or you would have to look the keys
[09:58:53] <Cork> hxm: but ya, spoky has a point, you have json so you need to parse it
[09:59:02] <Cork> (i missed the '' you had there)
[09:59:04] <hxm> i got it
[09:59:09] <hxm> thanks
[09:59:28] <hxm> this gets easier when I understand what I am doing lol
[09:59:50] <Cork> $.each(servers, function(server, channels) { $.each(channels, function(name, files) {}) })
[10:00:00] <Cork> that might be what your looking for
[10:00:31] <Cork> just taking a pot shot though
[10:00:34] <hxm> that is exactly what I were looking for
[10:00:48] <hxm> thanks
[10:01:16] <Cork> hxm: and in the inner each you want an $.each(files, function... if you want to loop the log files
[10:01:24] <lericson> Hello, can I do someElement.querySelector(mySelector) with jQuery?
[10:01:34] <hxm> yes ok
[10:01:39] <Cork> lericson: $(mySelector)
[10:01:44] <Cork> ah
[10:01:50] <Cork> sorry
[10:01:54] <lericson> Cork: almost ;)
[10:01:59] <Cork> $(someElement).find(mySelector)
[10:02:03] <lericson> ahh
[10:02:06] <lericson> it does the same?
[10:02:11] <Cork> yes
[10:02:29] <Cork> lericson: for reference $(selector) is a shorthand for $(document).find(selector)
[10:02:32] <lericson> fyi querySelector ≠ querySelectorAll
[10:02:59] <Cork> lericson: jquery always works with querSelectrAll
[10:03:09] <Cork> if you want just the first match use .first()
[10:03:10] <lericson> heh you can do .first
[10:03:25] <Cork> also if you match an id it will always be the first one
[10:03:32] <Cork> (and only the first one)
[10:03:52] <lericson> alright
[10:04:21] <Cork> lericson: btw it is almost the same as your code in another regard too
[10:04:30] <Cork> as it will result in dom elements wrapped in jquery
[10:04:39] <lericson> it reads better anyway, that's for sure
[10:04:48] <Cork> so to be exact
[10:05:01] <Cork> someElement.querySelector(mySelector) === $(someElement).find(mySelector)[0]
[10:05:05] <lericson> while i'm here, is this really the best way to go about this:
[10:05:05] <lericson>   replyTo.find('.cancel').click(function(ev) { replyTo.hide(); ev.preventDefault(); });
[10:05:40] <Cork> well for a start preventDefault should always be the first thing you do in the event
[10:05:48] <Cork> some events can be racy if you don't
[10:06:07] <Cork> lericson: you have multiple .cancel elements?
[10:06:13] <Cork> or just one?
[10:06:18] <lericson> i have one
[10:06:36] <Cork> then ya, it is about as good as it gets
[10:07:20] <Cork> if you had multiple you could make it a delegated event listener hand have it handle all the buttons
[10:07:40] <Cork> but it makes little difference if there is only one
[10:13:14] <lericson> alright then Cork, what if I have several buttons?
[10:13:34] <Cork> ?api delegate
[10:13:34] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:13:35] <lericson> Cork: you think I should create an event listener on the parent DOM node and just look for some event targets?
[10:13:43] <lericson> oh really
[10:14:13] <Cork> lericson: you can in newer versions of jquery use .on as a combination function for both .bind and .delegate
[10:14:26] <Cork> but you will have to check the syntax on the api page
[10:14:29] <Cork> ?api on
[10:14:29] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:15:45] <jcool> how do we store selected items in our database?
[10:16:01] <Cork> "our"?
[10:16:16] <jcool> oops.
[10:16:20] <jcool> in database*
[10:16:30] <Cork> where is the database?
[10:16:33] <Cork> a server side one?
[10:16:45] <Cork> and by selected you mean selectable or...?
[10:16:53] <jcool> Cork, right now working locally. I mean selectable.
[10:16:56] <jcool> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/gQuV7/3/
[10:17:19] <Cork> jcool: check serialize on the api page
[10:17:44] <Simon____> wonder if anybody could help me implementing jquerymobile withing some MVC pages
[10:18:03] <Cork> uh
[10:18:04] <jcool> Cork, sure.
[10:18:06] <Cork> hmm
[10:18:12] <Cork> it was there, but not anymore >_<
[10:18:41] <Cork> jcool: might be they hook into the normal serialize function
[10:18:48] <Cork> jcool: give it a go and see what you get out
[10:18:52] <Cork> ?api serialize
[10:18:52] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:18:59] <jcool> Cork, yeah sure.
[10:19:38] <Cork> ah
[10:19:49] <Cork> jcool: it might have been sortable i'm thinking of
[10:20:03] <Cork> not sure if that ever existed for selectable :/
[10:21:20] <jcool> Cork, I have certain departments that a user has to selects. he can select multiple ones at a time. Those departments get loaded once the user slects institution from dropdown
[10:21:21] <mdev> is if($(Element).length) the best way to check if an element exists
[10:21:28] <Cork> jcool: if that doesn't work you could do $.map($(selectable).find('.ui-selected'), function(elm) { return elm.value; })
[10:21:29] <mdev> whether it be an id or class?
[10:21:56] <Cork> mdev: well length > 0
[10:21:57] <CarlFK> Cork: git commit -a -m "abuse accordion so that multiple panels stay open."  http://veyepar.nextdayvideo.com/main/C/fosdem/S/fosdem_2014/E/7964/  (scroll down to         2014-02-02/08_45_19.dv   09:45:19   Apply ) :D
[10:21:58] <Cork> but yes
[10:22:16] <mdev> if($(Element).length) doesn't indicate > 0/
[10:22:17] <mdev> ?
[10:22:21] <Simon____> Why would this load as just text in an MVC page, I've installed jquerymobile nugget
[10:22:22] <jcool> Cork, I have got my dropwn and else working. response is coming. and I setting that response in li tags for Selectable. I wonder is there any other meethod then that to let user selct mutiple things?
[10:22:30] <Cork> mdev: no it indicateds truthy, not > 0
[10:22:36] <mdev> thanks
[10:22:47] <Cork> mdev: it works, but it irks me :)
[10:22:57] <mdev> http://jqueryfordesigners.com/index.html%3Fp=24.html example is wrong then
[10:22:58] <jcool> Cork, map sounds a cool option too.
[10:22:59] <Cork> mdev: and some projects won't accept code like tha
[10:23:08] <Cork> +t
[10:23:21] <Cork> mdev: it isn't exactly wrong
[10:23:37] <Cork> mdev: what you do is if(0) and if(1)
[10:23:47] <Cork> (or if(1000) )
[10:24:18] <Cork> and 0 is falsy and anything other is truty
[10:24:21] <jcool> Cork, I am little unsure how does that work. I understood it is returning value of selected element. but what about multiple selected?
[10:24:28] <Antaranian> hey ladies
[10:24:36] <Cork> mdev: it is considered bad practise to depend on truty in most projects though
[10:25:12] <Cork> jcool: it builds an array of all the values from the selected ones
[10:25:55] <Simon____> howcome jquery mobile is invite only
[10:25:57] <Antaranian> Cork: is there any reason why `if (1)` is better than `if (1 > 0)` ?
[10:26:17] <jcool> Cork, will it show me output in jsfiddle too? I am new to this things but definetly will give it a try. I dont know how to output that but I will give it atry.
[10:26:17] <Cork> Antaranian: no
[10:26:33] <Cork> Antaranian: except three chars less
[10:26:37] <jcool> argh.same things twice.sorry.
[10:26:41] <Antaranian> Cork: sorry, I wanted to ask the vice-versa
[10:27:08] <Cork> Antaranian: ah, it is clear th your checking if a value is not zero
[10:27:25] <Cork> while the other might be your checking if a string is emptyu
[10:27:26] <Cork> -u
[10:27:32] <Cork> or a boolean
[10:27:35] <Cork> or undefined
[10:27:36] <Cork> or...
[10:27:45] <Cork> unknown is often not liked in code
[10:27:51] <Antaranian> Cork: got your point
[10:28:36] <Cork> Antaranian: that is why i said it is goo practice, and not technically wrong
[10:28:41] <Cork> *good
[10:28:53] <Cork> hmm hitting my keys a bit too softly...
[10:29:46] <Antaranian> agree,  (arr.length) instead of (arr.length > 0) looks better for me, and I don't believe in next decades ECMA-x will treat 0 as `true`
[10:30:22] <Cork> Antaranian: it isn't about what the engine does
[10:30:29] <Cork> Antaranian: it is all about readability
[10:30:47] <Cork> arr.length doesn't say anything about what length is
[10:31:01] <Cork> arr.length > 0 clearly state that it is a number
[10:31:54] <Cork> jcool: http://jsfiddle.net/gQuV7/5/
[10:33:09] <jcool> Cork, yeah was just reading map() function to know parameters.where does this display output?
[10:33:32] <Cork> jcool: in the browsers console
[10:33:40] <jcool> woosh
[10:33:44] <Cork> ctrl+shift+j in most browsers
[10:34:19] <Cork> opps ctrl+shift+k in firefox
[10:34:45] <jcool> yay.it shows me all the id's selected in array.
[10:34:55] <Cork> not id's
[10:34:57] <Cork> values
[10:35:00] <jcool> I mean values.
[10:35:09] <jcool> yep.
[10:35:28] <Cork> btw you should use data-value
[10:35:31] <Cork> not value
[10:35:38] <Cork> as it isn't a default attribute
[10:35:47] <learning> how do you override links from opening in browser and open up in jquery mobile (app)..
[10:36:06] <jcool> Cork, surely will modify that thing. :)
[10:36:21] <jcool> Cork, thanks for that help.
[10:36:26] <Cork> np
[10:43:38] <jcool> Cork, in this way we fetch the selected items and store them, but is reverse possible. I fetch data from database and make those elements select onload?
[10:47:24] <TheWhisper> hey
[10:47:33] <TheWhisper> Is it possible to get offset().right?
[10:47:46] <TheWhisper> Right now I'm doing it by: 	panelRight = width - $('#indexWorkDisplay').offset().left;
[10:48:13] <TheWhisper> but when I animate that, it causes the element to shift to the offset().left position and then animate from there
[10:50:57] <Cork> TheWhisper: you would have to take offset().left + width()
[10:51:18] <Cork> TheWhisper: elements is drawn with top,left and width, height
[10:51:23] <Cork> so you have no right bottom
[10:51:52] <TheWhisper> width - offset.left works for me in that it puts the element in the correct place at the end of the animation
[10:52:03] <TheWhisper> but it doesn't start the animation in the proper place
[10:52:32] <learning> meep meep
[10:53:02] <Cork> TheWhisper: width - left would not give you right
[10:53:20] <Cork> it would give you the width of the element minus the left offset
[10:53:31] <TheWhisper> Cork, here, lemme show you
[10:53:45] <TheWhisper> http://discoverdan.com/index_wip#work
[10:53:57] <TheWhisper> click on one of the images
[10:54:19] <Cork> image?
[10:54:26] <Cork> ah the text are images
[10:54:44] <TheWhisper> The grey things with the 1s
[10:54:45] <TheWhisper> :P
[10:55:17] <jcool> Cork, got that ;)
[10:55:29] <Cork> TheWhisper: you mean in the work page?
[10:55:33] <TheWhisper> yes
[10:55:35] <Cork> TheWhisper: you link doesn't go there
[10:55:40] <TheWhisper> It should
[10:55:42] <TheWhisper> It does for me
[10:55:46] <Cork> it doesn't
[10:55:55] <Cork> it brought me to the start page
[10:55:56] <TheWhisper> It does for me in both FF and Chrome
[10:56:05] <TheWhisper> Do you have JS enabled?
[10:56:13] <Cork> ya
[10:56:16] <TheWhisper> That's why
[10:56:21] <TheWhisper> Oh
[10:56:26] <Cork> http://discoverdan.com/index_wip#work bings me http://discoverdan.com/index_wip
[10:56:32] <TheWhisper> hm
[10:56:36] <TheWhisper> What browser?
[10:56:42] <Cork> ff
[10:56:49] <TheWhisper> version?
[10:56:54] <Cork> and chromium
[10:56:59] <Cork> ff31 and...
[10:57:09] <Cork> chromium 33
[10:57:10] <TheWhisper> It doesn't bring you here: http://i.imgur.com/CQIswUI.png ?
[10:57:22] <Cork> no
[10:57:24] <TheWhisper> hrm
[10:57:41] <Cork> hmm on second loading chrome works
[10:57:45] * Cork tries again in firefox
[10:57:54] <TheWhisper> It works fine for me in ff28 and canary 36
[10:57:59] <Cork> uh..
[10:58:09] <Cork> ok so if you've visited the site it looks like it works
[10:58:18] <Cork> what ever...
[10:58:40] <Cork> (you shouldn't depend on js for page navigation...
[10:58:41] <Cork> )
[10:58:55] <TheWhisper> It navigates fine without JS
[10:58:58] <TheWhisper> just not as pretty
[10:59:14] <TheWhisper> Well, except I haven't put the menu on all the pages yet
[10:59:16] <TheWhisper> but otherwise it works fine
[10:59:26] <Cork> TheWhisper: no it doesn't load the correct page without js
[10:59:36] <TheWhisper> Oh, yeah, I know that
[10:59:45] <TheWhisper> I meant if you have JS disabled and click a link
[10:59:47] <TheWhisper> it works fine :P
[10:59:50] <TheWhisper> but anyway
[11:00:10] <TheWhisper> Do you see what I mean re: the animation?
[11:00:43] <Cork> well you take the width of the parent
[11:00:55] <Cork> and as your element has no margin on the right it works
[11:01:05] <Cork> but that is by coincidence
[11:01:18] <TheWhisper> It has a max-width though
[11:01:33] <Cork> TheWhisper: the fact still stands though
[11:01:42] <Cork> your not calculating right by width - left
[11:02:17] <TheWhisper> I know
[11:02:21] <TheWhisper> my question was how can I do that
[11:02:23] <TheWhisper> :P
[11:02:44] <Cork> and the answer is offset().left + .width()
[11:04:55] <TheWhisper> hm
[11:05:06] <TheWhisper> the ends up throwing the element off to the right outside the frame
[11:05:34] <Cork> TheWhisper: both should be from the element it self
[11:05:41] <TheWhisper> and still has the problematic animation problem
[11:05:51] <Cork> offset().left will give you the left edge of the element
[11:05:53] <TheWhisper> where it starts the animation from the left side of the window
[11:06:10] <Cork> if you then add the width of it you'll get its right edge
[11:06:32] <Cork> can you make a simple example of what your trying to do
[11:06:39] <Cork> without all the other parts of the full page
[11:06:42] <TheWhisper> yes
[11:06:47] <TheWhisper> the sample is
[11:06:50] <TheWhisper> wait
[11:06:52] <TheWhisper> you mean like a drawn one?
[11:06:56] <TheWhisper> or a function one?
[11:06:59] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[11:07:01] <Cork> or jsbin.com
[11:07:14] <Cork> a demo of the problem basically
[11:07:36] <Cork> where as much as possible of what isn't needed is removed
[11:18:27] <cubear> hey, is there a way to fix jquery with localstorage disabled? Some websites that use jquery refuse to work without localstorage, and there doesn't seem to be a mechanism to detect whether localstorage is disabed
[11:18:47] <cubear> example: gog.com - the payment frame doesn't load
[11:19:00] <Cork> cubear: it has nothing to do with jquery
[11:19:09] <cubear> hmm
[11:19:15] <cubear> hold on
[11:19:18] <Cork> cubear: the site can easily check if localstorage is available
[11:19:24] <Cork> many don't
[11:19:28] <Cork> (gog.com is one of them)
[11:19:57] <Cork> cubear: i even wrong an extension for firefox mainly to fix gog.com :)
[11:20:00] <Cork> so i know XD
[11:20:29] <cubear> okay, browser console says: TypeError: localStorage is null         _min_global.52e93c5e.js:38
[11:20:44] <Cork> cubear: all the site has to do is if(window.localStorage)
[11:20:50] <cubear> really, what's the extension name?
[11:20:52] <Cork> and have the localstorage code in there
[11:21:06] <Cork> ?g site:addons.mozilla.org shimstorage
[11:21:08] <b-ot> Cork: Shim Storage :: Add-ons for Firefox - Mozilla Add-ons → https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shim-storage/
[11:21:20] <cubear> question...
[11:21:30] <cubear> is there a FF addon for enabling localstorage per domain?
[11:21:40] <cubear> just like cookiemonster does it for cookies?
[11:21:40] <Cork> not that i know of
[11:21:45] <cubear> damn
[11:22:14] <Cork> but i just don't want them storing things on my system so i wrote that
[11:22:16] <TheWhisper> cork http://jsbin.com/yomiciwa/1/
[11:22:22] <TheWhisper> it doesn't actually work at all there
[11:22:38] <TheWhisper> dunno why
[11:22:52] <Cork> TheWhisper: hmm, i actually meant a simpler example
[11:23:02] <Cork> like just for the animation your working on
[11:23:05] <Cork> not all the other parts
[11:23:12] <TheWhisper> Yes
[11:23:20] <TheWhisper> That is :)
[11:24:16] <TheWhisper> Cork: http://i.imgur.com/b2SJgtF.gif <- that except I want the div to shrink to the right side of the element instead of the left
[11:24:47] <Cork> TheWhisper: this is still a heck of a lot of code to dig into to understand what your trying to do...
[11:25:05] <TheWhisper> Look at the image
[11:25:08] <TheWhisper> That shows what I want
[11:25:41] <Cork> but that doens't even go to the right...
[11:25:57] <TheWhisper> ...
[11:26:03] <TheWhisper> "that except I want the div to shrink to the right side of the element instead of the left"
[11:27:57] <Cork> well to start with, you most likely want to use left instead of margin-left
[11:28:43] <TheWhisper> Yup, that fixed it
[11:28:44] <TheWhisper> Thanks
[11:28:49] <TheWhisper> That was easy :P
[11:28:51] <Cork> ugg. na this is to much digging
[11:29:01] <TheWhisper> You fixed it already
[11:29:06] <TheWhisper> with the left instead of margin-left
[11:30:05] <cubear> Cork: Thanks, that shim storage addon seems to have fixed gog.com
[11:30:31] <Cork> cubear: ya, i know i use it at least a few times a week on that site :)
[11:31:09] <cubear> btw, is there also a way to redirect any call to ajax.googleapis.com to a local copy, so that google can't track me OMG!
[11:31:19] <Cork> cubear: what the extension does is basically creating a small object and sets window.localStorage to point to it
[11:31:38] <Cork> cubear: so sites that depend on the thing to exist will happily store things in the object, and work
[11:31:53] <Cork> cubear: but for each page reload you get a new object, so nothing is ever stored
[11:31:57] <cubear> and the object is destroyed once the page unloads
[11:31:59] <cubear> ah ok
[11:32:05] <cubear> nice
[11:32:33] <Cork> ya, it is fairly minimalistic
[11:42:42] <krisek101> Hi. How can I place data in get, in jquery and than use it. For example: I have got the 3-steps form. In first step I saved data by $.ajax{data:get etc.} and in third step i want to use it.
[11:56:26] <hxm> exists something like $("#id").on("change" for know when the value of that item has changed?
[11:56:33] <hxm> or where can I see the list of methods
[12:15:32] <MindIsAVortex> hi there, I'm trying to use the jquery animate function to let a card swipe off the screen by animating to a negative margin value. I'm getting smooth results in chrome, but in firefox it's glitchy. First it shoots to the right or the left, depending on which arrow you pressed, and then it slides.
[12:16:02] <MindIsAVortex> here's the fiddle, if anyone would like to look at it http://jsfiddle.net/MindIsAVortex/y69jg/
[12:17:30] <TheWhisper> can you put an if/else statement inside a .css()?
[12:18:03] <Simon____> dont suppose anybody can look at a mvc solution tried everything to get jquerymobile running but it doesnt see mobile access
[12:19:05] <MindIsAVortex> TheWhisper: no, I believe css() only takes an object with css key-value pairs as parameter
[12:19:10] <TheWhisper> k
[13:05:41] <occami> hey a quick question. I have a .on binding on several divs with the same class, now if i click on one the content is loaded as wished, but if i click on another div (with an other url in href) the content is not updated. Any ideas?
[13:06:34] <occami> <- noob, just saying. :)
[13:07:51] <BillCriswell> Make a small example at jsbin.com and share the link. It'll be much easier for people to help.
[13:08:05] <BillCriswell> occami ^^
[13:10:16] <occami> BillCriswell: I build something. :)
[13:38:37] <Erthe> Hey folks, I'm trying to show an element with jQuery using .show() and subsequently with .hide() to hide it, but... http://jsfiddle.net/2aTvx/
[13:38:53] <Erthe> It doesn't work unless I have the style on the element set initially to inline or inline-block
[13:39:02] <Erthe> With display set to none to start with, it never shows
[13:42:16] <BillCriswell> Everything I try to do command line wise with ruby fails miserably.
[13:49:20] <hxm> in this http://jsfiddle.net/m6p8w/ how can I get the name of the index of the last dropdown?
[13:56:44] <django> hello all, trying to use http://jqueryui.com/ im not sure if that is actually different than jquery library (the one on codeacademy)
[13:57:50] <BillCriswell> django: It's an add on.
[13:58:06] <systemfault> django: jQueryUI is like a tons of widgets built on top of jQueyr
[13:58:17] <systemfault> django: In fact, you cannot use them without jQuery
[13:58:40] <BillCriswell> hxm: You mean 20140405?
[13:58:54] <django> Thats what I thought, where can I get the jquery library?
[13:59:00] <hxm> BillCriswell: the current clicked item in the <ul> list
[14:01:19] <BillCriswell> hxm: You mean like the last item you clicked? You seem to want a select?
[14:01:22] <systemfault> django: I don’t want to be mean but… do you really need us to show you how to use google? :/
[14:01:56] <hxm> yes, like a select, but I use bootstrap and in the documentation they suggest not to use select because of the css
[14:02:01] <hxm> so I said aw ok
[14:02:05] <django> I had a feeling that was coming haha: http://jquery.com/download/
[14:05:40] <BillCriswell> How do they suggest you work with the data there? These mostly seem useful for a list of links.
[14:06:50] <raj> shoky, do you still program?
[14:08:21] <raj> django, jquery-ui builds off of jquery
[14:09:56] <shoky> raj, hm?? ;p
[14:17:45] <BillCriswell> hxm: http://jsbin.com/vebadugi/1/edit?html,js,output is this what you were shooting for?
[14:18:33] <django> setting up jquery for 1st time: <SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript" SRC="C:\Users\me\Desktop\jsstuff\jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></SCRIPT>
[14:18:39] <django> geting $ not defined
[14:20:09] <BillCriswell> Try just "jquery-1.11.0.min.js"
[14:20:22] <BillCriswell> If that doesn't work, you just can't access local files like that.
[14:21:02] <django> im linking another js file and it works just fine
[14:21:35] <BillCriswell> then the path is just wrong.
[14:21:51] <BillCriswell> or you're using $ before jQuery is included.
[14:22:17] <jphase> relative paths make the world a better place, and yelling your tag names might look look a little 1990 :\
[14:22:25] <BillCriswell> Also, no reason for the type attribute and all the uppercase action. <script src="foo.js"></script> is plenty
[14:22:32] <jphase> haha ^
[14:22:57] <django> BillCriswell lol your right
[14:26:21] <hxm> BillCriswell: amazing!
[14:26:51] <jnor> anyone know if latest fancybox should wotk with jquery 1.8 ?
[14:27:15] <BillCriswell> hxm: It's really not, there's going to be no easy way to get that data.
[14:27:28] <BillCriswell> jnor: Should. Check the console.
[14:27:43] <hxm> yes, is a bit weird
[14:31:32] <jnor> Thanks BillCriswell
[14:31:42] <BillCriswell> hxm: http://jsbin.com/vebadugi/2/edit?html,js,output This is the only semi sane way I could imagine approaching it.
[14:39:24] <simonj89> hi all
[14:40:56] <simonj89> quiet :(
[14:41:13] <CrowX-> how can I cover the current content with an element who has 100% width/height?
[14:41:28] <CrowX-> I tried setting z-index to higher, but it's still in the back
[15:01:53] <simonj89> hi all
[15:03:54] <jphase> hi
[15:04:39] <jphase> CrowX-: that's more of a css question, but yes, z-index + position + width + height in css will do the trick
[15:05:15] <CrowX-> jphase, it didn't. but nvm, I did .hide() to everything else
[15:05:50] <simonj89> jphase, if you dont mind. Do you reconise this? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'ajaxEnabled' of undefined
[15:06:31] <jphase> simonj89: have a code sample?
[15:07:35] <simonj89> yeah
[15:09:07] <simonj89> 2 secs
[15:14:16] <simonj89> https://jabbrlive.blob.core.windows.net/jabbr-uploads/_LayoutMobile_82e1.cshtml
[15:15:20] <simonj89> is it something to do with the ordering of my scripts etc?

[15:58:43] <Agamemnus> hello
[15:58:53] <Agamemnus> quick question, can't be bothered to remember..
[15:59:49] <Agamemnus> how do you create a jquery event like .delegate? What's the current way to do this in jquery?
[16:00:00] <systemfault> The second syntax of .on
[16:00:22] <systemfault> $(parentSelectorOrBody).on(eventName, selector, handler)
[16:00:50] <systemfault> $(‘body’).on(‘click’, ‘.lol’, function() { console.log(‘lol’); });
[16:00:53] <Agamemnus> Oh!
[16:00:54] <Agamemnus> Ok.
[16:01:08] <Agamemnus> Thanks.
[16:28:07] * Velveeta sidles up to the bar and sits next to you, clearing his throat and scratching his neck, tapping the bar, waiting for you to buy him a drink.
[16:31:35] <Velveeta> the wife fell asleep watching the great gatsby... imagine her surprise when she wakes up to deep space 9 instead..
[16:32:18] <Velveeta> not that gatsby wasn't a great movie so far... but i left off in the middle of the high point in the dominion war..
[16:40:18] <Velveeta> erthe: did you ever get an answer?
[16:40:59] <Erthe> I figured out what the problem was, rails includes turbolinks by default.. nasty stuff
[16:41:12] <Velveeta> ahhhh yes, rails ... nasty stuff :D
[16:45:26] <Erthe> Rails is great, turbolinks blows the big one haha
[16:46:21] <Velveeta> i've always found ruby itself to be a dirty language, so my opinion of rails was tainted from the start :D
[16:46:36] <Velveeta> however, reading the github page for turbolinks specifically, i would tend to agree with you
[16:47:12] <Velveeta> i don't understand how much overhead could be saved by simply swapping out the title and body contents... the only think they're cutting out is most of the head section, which relies heavily on browser caching anyway
[17:20:16] <django> im using class="ui-autocomplete-input". I am trying to have user input text, how do i go about setting this up
[17:27:25] <Velveeta> i don't exactly understand what you're asking...
[18:18:21] <Steve445> Anyone using SpacePen?
[18:28:07] <Agamemnus> is there any jquery library that allows one to see the height of the address bar?
[18:30:09] <araujo> address bar?..
[18:30:15] <araujo> of the browser?
[18:31:13] <Agamemnus> yes
[18:31:18] <Agamemnus> for..... phones/mobile
[18:33:33] <araujo> I think that would depend on the graphical toolkit used for the browser....
[18:34:17] <Agamemnus> :[
[18:34:51] <Agamemnus> i just wanna get the usable screen space, accounting for the address bar, but not accounting the keyboard
[18:38:40] <araujo> Agamemnus, I don't know if jquery has something like that, maybe wait and see if somebody else can tell better... but this sounds to me like very dependable to the browser GUI
[18:58:44] <Velveeta> agamemnus: are you just talking about the viewport size?
[19:12:52] <django> ui-autocomplete-input is a textbox correct?
[19:13:05] <django> i copied the code of inspect element from jqueryUI demo
[19:14:49] <jcool> django, you have option to view source on demo page itself.
[19:15:23] <django> theres no javascript
[19:16:00] <django> n/m
[19:16:01] <django> sorry
[19:16:10] <jcool> np
[19:17:05] <django> i havent really learned jquery..jsut do a run down on codeacademy??
[19:24:12] <teza19> Hi, I'm using 'scrollTo' to navigate to a section on the page (http://pastebin.com/SC13ppSr). I'm trying to incorporate an 'accordion' on the page now, and this using anchor (#) tags, which isn't working due to the JQuery attached. How can I work around this?
[19:30:29] <mikeche1en> in jquery mobile is there anything else required to show a loading message during ajax calls besides setting up $( document ).on( "mobileinit", function() {...}
[19:45:22] <Velveeta> mikeche1en: i don't know the answer to that question, but is there a reason you *need* something other than mobileinit?
[19:47:01] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: i figured it out, i was misunderstanding how to use it
[19:47:07] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:47:25] <mikeche1en> Velveeta: i thought you would set the options, then it would automatically be called during ajax queries
[19:47:44] <Velveeta> ahhhhhh gotcha
[19:48:42] <mikeche1en> ty for answering :)
[22:33:02] <learning> how do you surpass the cross-domain Ajax requests.In block by jquery mobile ??
[23:12:17] <learningmode151> 1> Hi im new to open source id like to start working on issue #57 of jQuery.com
[23:12:17] <learningmode151>  on github
[23:23:30] <drkshadow_> Is there any way for me to slidedown-disappear something? Like, if my mouse is below the element on the page, I'm probably looking at something there, so I'd much prefer if the removal of the element didn't shift the page.
[23:24:24] <drkshadow_> I can remove the element then reposition the page, but with slideUp I can't do it each step of the way; further, I don't want the jarring of just .remove()
