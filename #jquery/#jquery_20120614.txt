[00:03:41] <k_sze> I have a weird problem with jQuery in Firefox.
[00:04:04] <k_sze> I'm trying to unify the width of the navigation items at the top of this page: http://wptest.kalunite.net/
[00:04:29] <k_sze> what I do is define a function unifyNavWidth() and set it in jQuery(unifyNavWidth)
[00:04:40] <k_sze> so that it is run once the DOM is ready.
[00:06:37] <k_sze> However, in Firefox, the function seems to use the width of the 3rd nav item as the maxWidth, ignoring the 4th and 5th nav item.
[00:08:11] <k_sze> That, or it's using the width of the 4th nav item before CSS got applied on it.
[00:08:49] <k_sze> I don't have this problem with Internet Explorer 8 or Google Chrome.
[00:14:45] <shoky> k_sze: i only see 4 nav items
[00:15:08] <Ripp__> Can someone make recommendations for a good jQuery resizable window plugin?
[00:15:29] <Ripp__> I want this window to contain some ajax stuff, and be resizable and minimizable by the user.
[00:15:56] <k_sze> shoky: right. That's because you are not logged in. Regardless, I'm pretty sure that the second link has overflown to 2 lines on your screen, correct?
[00:16:40] <shoky> k_sze: ok just trying to understand
[00:16:59] <k_sze> wait...
[00:17:13] <k_sze> hold on
[00:17:53] <shoky> the 2nd link doesnt seem to overflow badly..
[00:18:33] <k_sze> shoky: refresh and you should now see 5 links
[00:22:14] <shoky> yep and the 2nd one is 2 lines
[00:22:39] <k_sze> weird, eh?
[00:22:45] <k_sze> it's set to 96px wide now
[00:22:53] <k_sze> I don't even know where that 96px value comes from
[00:23:06] <k_sze> if I use firebug to disable the on-element css width rul
[00:23:09] <k_sze> rule
[00:23:21] <k_sze> none of them is supposed to be 96px
[00:23:31] <k_sze> even the closest one is 98px
[00:26:44] <k_sze> Same problem in Safari for Windows.
[00:26:48] <shoky> um there are 2 javascript errors in the console
[00:47:55] <k_sze> $ and jQuery are equivalent, right?
[00:52:43] <ENQ> yes
[00:53:34] <Haprog> usually yes
[00:53:57] <Haprog> not always if run in noConflict mode or otherwise changed
[00:54:24] <raj> what's an efficient way to retrieve the .text() of the currently selected tab? (jquery-ui tabs)
[00:54:28] <klj613> is it possible to catch a window closing event which isn't reload? (asking just incase there is a way)
[01:03:50] <srisw> how do you normally refer to a "jquery element", i.e. the the result of a $(...) call?
[01:04:33] <raj> srisw, what do you mean?
[01:04:36] <raj> that's selecting it
[01:04:42] <raj> so that's how you 'refer' to it
[01:04:49] <srisw> yeah, the result of selecting something, what's the "type" of that
[01:05:05] <raj> jquery object
[01:05:15] <srisw> ok, so nothing fancy ;)
[01:05:18] <raj> you can examine it in your console.log
[01:05:22] <raj> i mean console
[01:05:35] <raj> well, it's pretty fancy
[01:05:38] <raj> if I do say so myself
[01:05:39] <srisw> yeah sure, i just want to name a parameter that is supposed to be a pre-selected jquery object
[01:05:41] <raj> which i do
[01:06:04] <Haprog> srisw: just save teh reference to a variable
[01:06:08] <Haprog> *the
[01:06:24] <raj> how's that different?
[01:07:03] <srisw> yeah, i just wanted to have a good name for the "jquery Object" in a function like var myFunc = function(jqueryObject, ...) { ... };
[01:07:03] <Haprog> oh it was about parameters
[01:08:03] <Haprog> I think jQuery (with a capital Q) is the actual name of the constructor function ("class name")
[01:08:43] <Haprog> actually I haven't looked at jQuery internals that much..
[01:09:57] <bitbuzzer> I am using jqueryui sortable on a knockout.js application. I have a div containr with spans that I am sorting. After the sort, the original span is still showing. How can I fix this?
[01:15:30] <FinalAngel> how can I filter elements like: $(els).not('class="active"'); ?
[01:16:35] <klj613> how to catch a window closing event which isnt the page reloading?
[01:17:12] <Cork> FinalAngel: $(els).not('.active'); ?
[01:18:24] <Cork> klj613: as far as i know, you can't
[01:18:30] <Cork> klj613: not generically
[01:20:42] <klj613> Cork: okay, thanks.
[01:22:28] <bitbuzzer> anyone familiar with jqueryui sortable?
[01:36:27] <raj> can I select a tab using a string containing its <a href=>'s value?
[01:37:15] <ussher_> Im looking for something like a progress bar that i can use to count down 60 seconds.  found this progress bar: http://www.bram.us/demo/projects/jsprogressbarhandler/ but it uses prototype, not jquery.
[01:41:59] <species> ussher_: i last did this with just css - a div inside a div, with a margin, and css to set the percent
[01:43:42] <ussher_> species: so im being tooo lazy then? :)  ok.  ill go fiddle.  thanks.
[01:44:34] <species> this was using dojo, not jquery, but I was doing like foo.style.width = percentComplete + "%";
[01:45:03] <ussher_> species: i just ran into this one which might be what im looking for. www.javascriptbank.com/javascript/framework/jquery/jquery-javascript-countdown-timer-with-bar-display/preview/  the structure is a bet weird though.  but its a place to start
[01:45:05] <species> jquery equiv would be i think $(foo).css("width", percentComplete = "%");
[01:45:44] <species> s/=/+
[01:46:50] <ussher_> i see what your saying.  then just figure out percentComplete and thats it.
[01:46:52] <ussher_> nice
[01:50:07] <Xotix> is there a good document editor liek  google docs? ^^
[01:50:12] <Xotix> plugin
[01:57:40] <Bauer> guys, when I attempt to move the cursor to the END of the input box, this code does not work in case the cursor was somewhere in middle of the text before this code execution: $("#number_Phone").focus().val($("#number_Phone").val()); (this is triggered by a focusout event)
[01:58:00] <Bauer> it works randomly - sometimes it would work, other times it will highlight first 3 chars
[02:03:42] <Bauer> and in IE its not working properly at all
[02:13:12] <Bauer> Here is a demonstration of my problem in IE: http://jsfiddle.net/MGDjn/ first type something like 8123 and click on the text below - it refocuses forcing you to add a leading 0, after that click on text again - it refocuses forcing you to complete the line at the END - this does not happen in IE :( it stays at the beginning of the line
[02:42:04] <Xotix> is there a ncie solution for making the texxt background blur so you can read it on a detailed background?
[02:42:55] <Whirl3d> Xotix, not really. There are a couple of php utilities, but not in js that I know of. you could do a transparent background--that's as close as I have heard of...
[02:43:40] <Xotix> Whirld3d mhm but ig i generate it with php i can just add it as a background image sso...
[02:44:40] <NodeX> what are you trying to accomplish ?
[02:44:57] <Whirl3d> but if you know ahead of time whtat the bg looks like, blur a second imageand swap them out
[02:45:25] <Whirl3d> take a snapshot of the screen at a given location, blur the snapshot and set it as a bg image
[02:45:52] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/bq2SJ/3/ something like this -> http://www.cloudcar.com/ the page looks very free and soft because of the simple background. tried to get something on a different background by just appling some blur at the text background
[02:45:59] <Xotix> but you alwas see some kidn of content area
[02:46:18] <Xotix> anyway thanks
[02:46:42] <Whirl3d> in that case you could do it
[02:46:59] <Whirl3d> just have a duplicate bg image that is already blurred. Apply that to your text
[02:47:17] <Whirl3d> it's just dynamic content that you are gonna have a hard time bluring
[02:47:52] <Whirl3d> although you might be able to with css3 transforms...never seen or heard of it, but I supposed there might be a way
[02:48:21] <Whirl3d> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ItemBlur/
[02:49:28] <Xotix> normally i just make a transparent backgroudn content area which you really see but i try to "hide" it. ^^
[02:49:46] <Xotix> thx
[02:50:06] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm anyone know why this power zoom goes behind the image? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[02:50:12] <fRAiLtY-> Hover the big image and you'll see what I mean
[02:53:02] <Whirl3d> something in your css,
[02:53:20] <fRAiLtY-> I have no css for that zoomer
[02:53:34] <Whirl3d> doesn't mean css don't exist for it.
[02:54:11] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: your image is absolute positioned
[02:54:19] <Whirl3d> manually setting zIndex to 900 works
[02:54:26] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: just adde 'z-index: 2' to the zoomer
[02:54:44] <Cork> anything > 1 works
[02:57:24] <fRAiLtY-> OK cheers guys
[02:58:03] <Whirl3d> Cork, why can't a jquery object instance have it's own methods defined for it?
[02:58:16] <Cork> Whirl3d: sure they can
[02:58:33] <Cork> Whirl3d: but each time you run $() a new object is created
[02:58:34] <Whirl3d> Why is there no way to do $("myobj").customMethod()   instead of trigger('curstom");
[02:59:47] <Cork> and it should only exist on "myobj" and not on $("myotherobject") ?
[02:59:48] <Whirl3d> is it bad form to write a plugin that immediately checks "this" to see if it has certain properties?
[03:00:10] <Cork> else just add it to $.fn
[03:00:34] <Thoams> Hi, slight drag / drop problem: http://pastebin.com/DZXYbxq3 my drop function executes twice, not sure why, and ui.draggable's id is undefined. ind comes back as -1, because the dropped element has no id. I'm badly needing to set a sane id on dropped elements so I can send them off to process_sortable.php
[03:00:43] <Cork> Whirl3d: depends a bit, but not really
[03:01:39] <Whirl3d> cool. thanks.
[03:02:55] <Thoams> ^ and the original elements for dragging do have ids
[03:04:55] <Cork> Thoams: that doesn't really make sense
[03:05:12] <Cork> Thoams: could you make a working demo on jsfiddle instead of a stale pb?
[03:05:51] <Thoams> I'll have a go, cheers
[03:11:56] <Thoams> http://jsfiddle.net/KNzTM/42/
[03:12:19] <jigal> can someone please help me to understand the function of $.proxy
[03:12:22] <jigal> don't realy get it
[03:12:45] <Thoams> Cork: thank goodness I actually replicated the problem. Quite confused at this point.
[03:13:13] <Cork> Thoams: i'm have a look at it when i get back from luch
[03:13:27] <Thoams> Thanks, I'll keep trying.
[03:29:57] <Zitter> hi, does someone recognize this jq plugin http://www.yootheme.com/widgetkit/examples/slideset ?
[03:40:33] <Thoams> Okay, it sort of makes sense why a draggable element's id doesn't persist - that'd result in elements with identical ids, which isn't allowed. I can set the id, but I'm still faced with the problem that my drop function fires twice, which sort of pulls the rug from under me
[03:40:37] <Thoams> http://jsfiddle.net/KNzTM/61/
[03:43:36] <Thoams> might be related to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1547 but I've alerted ev.type and found both fires have a type of 'drop'
[03:43:51] <Xotix> is it bad to load html contant like in the odldays in a frame styled manner so if you have a navigation and you klick you load an replce the content via ajax?

[03:51:34] <Posterdati> hi
[03:51:52] <Posterdati> how can I hook a jquery tooltip to an svg icon/button?
[03:53:52] <Whirl3d> Posterdati, every day? lol every day you ask the same basic question and get the same basic answer. It's kinda funny. I thought Shoky helped you get all that squared away yesterday...
[03:56:52] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: not for tooltip
[03:57:29] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: never asked that, it is funny to see that you don't understand what you read
[03:58:14] <Whirl3d> lol
[03:58:33] <Whirl3d> but you got the button events handled, right?
[03:58:37] <Posterdati> yes
[03:58:42] <Posterdati> at least
[03:58:49] <Posterdati> it was an hybrid
[03:58:49] <Whirl3d> Then why can't you figure it out from there?
[03:58:58] <Whirl3d> It's going to be very similar
[03:59:13] <Posterdati> yes, but I missed something
[03:59:14] <Whirl3d> it's just instead of the button events you will use the hover event
[03:59:16] <Posterdati> for example
[03:59:31] <Posterdati> I'd like to use mouseover event
[03:59:41] <Whirl3d> okay
[03:59:55] <Posterdati> so in the ready envent I hardcoded a mouseover() and a click()
[04:00:00] <Posterdati> clik() works perfect
[04:00:01] <Whirl3d> but you probably want it to only fire when it's over this complex svg image right?
[04:00:12] <Posterdati> yes
[04:00:16] <Whirl3d> wow
[04:00:29] <Posterdati> I want only a simple tooltip over an svg
[04:00:42] <Posterdati> not do the tooltip with the svg
[04:00:52] <Posterdati> like a link tooltip
[04:00:54] <Whirl3d> it's not the tooltip that's difficult. It's the SVG
[04:00:59] <Posterdati> ok
[04:01:16] <Posterdati> in the svg I wrote events for onmouseover and onmouseout
[04:01:33] <Posterdati> and they worked, because they simply change the transparency of the svg draw
[04:01:52] <Posterdati> no interaction with jquery
[04:02:26] <Posterdati> may I use jquery libs in the svg?
[04:02:30] <Thoams> AHA! I AM INVINCIBLE!
[04:02:43] * Thoams shouldn't quote Boris...
[04:03:19] * Thoams does the 'Solved My Own Problem' dance instead.
[04:03:47] <Thoams> should've been doing things in my sortable list's receive function
[04:04:02] <Thoams> that deserves a cig break
[04:04:25] <Thoams> Cork: thanks for your offer of help :)
[04:04:39] <coder2> how can i implement an interface like this using jquerymobile http://snag.gy/HZR2p.jpg
[04:04:49] <coder2> or jquery
[04:05:10] <Armern> Hi there guys! I have a little problem using jQuery UI's draggable. The problem is best illustrated using the following example: http://jsfiddle.net/EPYm2/1/. What I would like to be able to do is adjust the dimensions of the draggable after I start dragging it, and have the containment use the NEW dimensions rather than the initial dimensions. Is there any way to achieve this?
[04:07:16] <Whirl3d> Posterdati, did you try to use jquery in your svg?
[04:08:08] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: I don't know how to include jquery support in the svg
[04:15:54] <Whirl3d> just call a javascript function
[04:16:04] <Whirl3d> jquery is just javascript
[04:16:16] <Posterdati> may I use a javascript function defined in the html document?
[04:16:28] <Whirl3d> yes
[04:16:31] <Whirl3d> or outside
[04:16:44] <Posterdati> .myfunction() ?
[04:16:45] <Whirl3d> http://www.carto.net/svg/samples/mouse_over_effects.shtml
[04:16:57] <Posterdati> oh thanks
[04:18:08] <Whirl3d> coder2, seriously? what is that?
[04:19:34] <coder2> Whirl3d, i have to make that page for mobile devices, which just fits nicely on whole screen
[04:19:36] <Whirl3d> Armern, could you ask your question another way? You want to use the bounds of the expanded object,correct?
[04:19:47] <coder2> and dont have to scroll it
[04:19:49] <Whirl3d> coder2, are they buttons
[04:19:53] <Whirl3d> are they divs
[04:19:56] <Whirl3d> is it a table>
[04:20:02] <Whirl3d> an image
[04:20:14] <Whirl3d> It's entirely unclear what you want to do
[04:20:45] <coder2> Whirl3d, i have to choose how to implement it either table or divs or list
[04:21:21] <SPYGAME> hey, i have to find an element with a particular value from a list of two objects, how do i do that ?
[04:22:20] <SPYGAME> jQuery('.media_delete') gives me two objects, how do i find one with a particular value from those two objects ?
[04:22:41] <Christer_> Hi guys, im struggling a bit with a problem here - i got this touch screen - but i cant figgure out wich event it fires when im clicking around the screen (touchevents, clicks e.e ) - Is there anyway to parse this in an alert or something?
[04:25:43] <Armern> Whirl3d: that is correct indeed. If it would help any bit (I left it out because I feared it might make it too complicated for this purpose), in actual fact this is what I'm trying to do: my draggable is inside a 'column', and its width is set to 100% of that column. When I drag, I detach the draggable from the column and append it to a container (which contains many columns).
[04:26:15] <Armern> Then, when I release the draggable, I have a custom 'drop' code, which will detach the draggable from the container, and place it in the column that it was dropped on
[04:26:23] <Xotix> how do u achieve that? http://www.cloudcar.com/
[04:26:58] <Whirl3d> Armern, I didn't read your reply yet, but is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/EPYm2/6/
[04:27:07] <Armern> The problem is that the item has width 100% inside the column, so when you detach it and append it to the container, the helper will have '100%' width, which I don't want
[04:28:55] <Whirl3d> then don't use % width measurements
[04:28:59] <Armern> Hmmm, Whirl3d: not exactly.. as the 100px width and height is not a fixed given, it could be any dimension...
[04:29:04] <Whirl3d> manually call out the width
[04:29:48] <Armern> Whirl3d: the problem is that the columns have a fluid width, so I use % to ensure that the draggable is always the full width of the column, regardless of its width
[04:30:03] <Whirl3d> why?
[04:30:13] <Whirl3d> Just get the width of the column on drag start
[04:31:45] <Armern> Whirl3d: Hrmm, that won't exactly work will it? When the column's width is altered by some way, how would I then resize the draggable to match the column's width?
[04:32:03] <Whirl3d> it shouldn't resize while dragging
[04:32:09] <Whirl3d> should it?
[04:32:30] <Whirl3d> just adjust the size of the element on drag start every time
[04:32:58] <Xotix> any good coding editors as a plugin?
[04:33:14] <Whirl3d> no
[04:33:18] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:33:26] <Whirl3d> a plugin for what?
[04:34:26] <Xotix> like codemirror
[04:34:31] <Armern> Whirl3d: No, that is true, while dragging, the width of the element should not change. But I'm talking about when I'm not dragging yet. When I'm not dragging, the column width could change, so the draggable should also change its width. The easiest way to ensure that the element is always the same width as the column it is inside is to give it a 100% width, right?
[04:35:27] <Whirl3d> that may be the easiest way, but if you are detatching it from a column, then perhaps its not the best
[04:35:38] <Armern> Whirl3d: My problem would then be solved if on drag start, I could convert the % width to a px width, but ondragstart seems to be too late to change the width. Draggable has by then already assumed a 100% width...
[04:36:05] <Whirl3d> maybe whenever you attach it to a column, you really attach it to a div that is set to 100% inside the column.
[04:37:12] <Whirl3d> why can't you just assign the width in px whenever you attach it to the column?
[04:38:05] <Armern> Whirl3d: Hmmm, I don't yet see how that would change the situation though? I can't assign a px value because the column's width is dynamic, and I want the element to always be the same width as the column, so it too must be dynamic
[04:38:08] <Whirl3d> how about this
[04:38:22] <Whirl3d> how about not starting the drag event until after you have clicked the element
[04:38:42] <Whirl3d> so manage the click event, then size the objected in your click handler and initialize the draggable
[04:39:30] <Whirl3d> what can cause the width of the column to change?
[04:39:31] <duderion> hi guys. i have a rather basic question about ui-dialogs. i try to set up a windows-like desktop with dialogs. so i open and close them dynamically. now i cannot use ajax pagination, as it doesn't find the .ui-dialog-content in the scope (perhaps because of Live ??)
[04:39:34] <duderion> http://pastebin.ca/2161173
[04:39:35] <Armern> is that possible? If I could bind a 'mousedown' event, then do stuff, and THEN trigger a drag event, that'd be great
[04:39:51] <Whirl3d> sure, why wouldn't it be possible?
[04:40:05] <Armern> I have no idea why not, I just don't yet know how XD
[04:40:57] <Whirl3d> I'm trying it out right now.. brb
[04:41:16] <Armern> Whirl3d: sweet, thanks!
[04:42:47] <duderion> $(this).closest('.ui-dialog-content') is undefined in the live-dialog
[04:43:06] <duderion> but it exists in firebug console....help pleeeease :D
[04:46:07] <Ring0`> Hi. This line > $.when( element.addClass('taphl') ).then( function() { alert('ok') } ); < on iOS (Safari mobile) it will first display alert, I have to close it and only after then class will be applied.
[04:46:13] <Ring0`> Any ideas why?:O
[04:52:41] <Whirl3d> Armern, here's an idea: what if you had a duplicate set of columns with no content above the other set of columns. then rather than detaching the draggable, drag the whole set of columns and use the snapto feature to align the two sets of columns
[04:53:04] <Ring0`> Oh actually desktop safari has that prolem too.
[04:54:24] <Thoams> Okay, scrap what I said earlier: I'm not invincible and my problem persists
[04:54:29] <Thoams> Sadface.
[04:54:36] <Whirl3d> does (element.addClass("something")) return a deferred object?
[04:54:49] <pachet> Thoams: i joined late, what was the problem
[04:55:13] <Thoams> http://jsfiddle.net/KNzTM/84/ I need to be able to set an ID on an inserted element
[04:56:17] <Whirl3d> RingO', I haven't used .when alot, but it says in the api docs that .when takes a deferred object for a paramter and addClass doesn't return a deferred object
[04:56:54] <Thoams> the alert in the receive function tells me the id, but the entry in the list has no id at all. It does make sense that you can't clone an element directly, you'd have conflicting ids, but I need to be able to set one programmatically so I can POST the list
[04:57:50] <Ring0`> Whirl3d: I see. can i do this anyhow?.. I dont want to use settimeout since it's inaccurate
[04:57:56] <Ring0`> moreover it works on all browsers but Safari.
[04:59:12] <pachet> why would you need a setTimeout on addClass
[04:59:15] <pachet> or a deferred object
[04:59:16] <Whirl3d> you could use .when like this: $.when(function () {$(this).addClass("class"); return $.Deferred().resolve()).then (something)
[05:00:00] <Whirl3d> but .then takes two parameters: success and fail. use .done instead
[05:00:38] <Ring0`> pachet: because safari has some strange behavious, I have to highlight object then wait until ajax execute and remove HL. And on safari it highlights after ajax is done.
[05:00:42] <Ring0`> ok Whirl3d Ill try
[05:01:30] <Whirl3d> wait, ajax returns a deferred. lol
[05:02:08] <Ring0`> Whirl3d: but I must highlight it BEFORE ajax starts executing
[05:02:16] <Whirl3d> so do it
[05:02:25] <Ring0`> oh yes, i know there is before and after
[05:02:27] <Ring0`> param
[05:02:30] <Ring0`> but it's a bit more complex.
[05:02:30] <Articate> is there a way to make the hide/show of toggle('slow') hide and show the element in a different way?
[05:02:47] <Whirl3d> in the line before your ajax call, add the highlight calss
[05:03:13] <Articate> right now it expands from x: 0, y: 0, but I want it to start at x:width y:0 (that is, just flow downwards, not right and downwards)
[05:03:31] <Whirl3d> no need to convoulte your ajax call. just right before you submit the ajax call , apply the class and use .when() to remove it
[05:03:35] <Ring0`> Whirl3d: that's the thing. I did! And Safari wont add it, lol
[05:03:58] <Whirl3d> How is that posible?
[05:04:15] <Whirl3d> Safari doesn't know you are about to do the ajax call when you apply the class
[05:04:24] <Whirl3d> so how could it choose not to do it?
[05:04:32] <duderion> isnt it possible to have a newly opened dialog and tell the paginator in the dialog 'once you are clicked, load your href to the surrounding dialog' ???
[05:04:35] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I don't know the context of your previous msg about wanting addClass to return a deferred
[05:04:46] <johnkpaul> but I have been playing around with a POC of jquery methods that trigger events
[05:04:48] <johnkpaul> http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/pXDt9/
[05:04:52] <Ring0`> tell me Whirl3d. Lets sy I have this: element.addclass('bla'); alert ('ok'); should class be visible before alert popups ?
[05:05:21] <Whirl3d> if element exists, yes
[05:05:36] <Ring0`> thats the thing. on safari class will be visible after u click "OK"
[05:05:38] <Ring0`> on alert box
[05:06:00] <Ring0`> maybe it's added in code but not visible for eyes
[05:06:58] <Whirl3d> are you doing this in a a document ready handler?
[05:08:15] <Whirl3d> are you talking about literally using Alert?
[05:08:18] <Whirl3d> don't do that
[05:08:20] <Whirl3d> lol
[05:08:38] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, can somebody verify that there's no errors in this code? (3 simple lines).  I'm getting a "Can't call 'toLowerCase' of undefined" on the second line of this pastebin: http://pastebin.com/KLKVH24d
[05:08:38] <Armern> Whirl3d: Woohoo! I fixed it! You idea about doing something BEFORE dragstart gave me the idea of trying the mousedown event first.. and she works like a charm: http://jsfiddle.net/EPYm2/15/ I can set the 'dynamic' start width to whatever I want, and it'll work
[05:09:15] <Pupeno_W> How do I prevent the jquery-ui date picker showing up on browsers that show a native date picker for date fields? Like iPhone's.
[05:09:29] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: this inside setTimeout is the window obj
[05:09:32] <Ring0`> no, not literally Whirl3d .. but its an example
[05:10:03] <DeltaHeavy> johnkpaul: Ah, thanks.
[05:10:04] <Whirl3d> Ring0, an example of what? Alert is a special case.
[05:10:05] <sunbeam> when i have a submenu, ul li ul li , and the second ul li (submenu items) are not the full width of the text, but only the width of the parent, how can i best fix this?
[05:10:10] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: np
[05:10:19] <sunbeam> is there a way to make the ul have the width of the parent, or more (until it fits) with js?
[05:10:23] <sunbeam> or can this be done with css someway
[05:10:49] <Whirl3d> you can't say that ANYTHING that happens after an addClass in safari is going to be delayed until you click an okay button...
[05:11:00] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: you should ask #css, does width:100% not work?
[05:11:58] <sunbeam> no
[05:12:08] <sunbeam> not on the sub ul and not on the sub li
[05:12:34] <sunbeam> but even if it would works, then it takes the width of the parent, which i dont want
[05:12:58] <sunbeam> i mean it works sorry, on the sub li's
[05:13:01] <sweb> is it possible to use .ajax instead getJSON for fetch jsonp ... cros ajax ?
[05:14:24] <Cork> sweb: yes
[05:14:40] <Cork> sweb: all get* uses .ajax in the background
[05:14:51] <Whirl3d> Ringo, setup a function lie :   function applyHighlight(elem) {elem.addClass("yello"); return $.Deferred.resolve();} then pipe it to the ajax call and pipe that to another function that removes the highlight...so it would look ugly and ridiculous, but it should work even give the strange behaviour you are claiiming
[05:16:15] <Cork> sweb: $.ajax({ url:'', crossDomain: true, dataType: 'jsonp', data: {} })
[05:16:29] <sweb> Cork: ty
[05:16:54] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, that is SWEET
[05:17:10] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: :) cool. I need to make it nicer and probably write a blog post
[05:17:18] <johnkpaul> but I've found it useful a few times
[05:17:29] <johnkpaul> mostly in legacy codebases
[05:17:41] <Whirl3d> Yeah, my mind is racing...there are lots of places where that makes just tons of sense.
[05:18:21] <fuchstronaut> how to fadeIn an a-element so it will be display: block, not display: inline? on loading its display-property is hidden
[05:20:33] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: use .css after the fade to change it to block
[05:21:02] <Cork> fuchstronaut: $(elm).css('display', 'block').hide().fadeIn(time);
[05:21:33] <Cork> hide() sets what show/*In will animate to
[05:22:03] <fuchstronaut> thanks
[05:22:38] <jigal> can anyone tell me what the right selector is for the map button on google maps?
[05:22:41] <fuchstronaut> is there a way to make a parent-elemnt extend its width/height to fit it's children elments, even if their display is set to hidden
[05:23:23] <raj> johnkpaul, showed me something else awesome (and fancy as hell) --> some_array = $.map(some_array, $); --> turning an array of html strings into a jquery object
[05:23:24] <Cork> fuchstronaut: you mean visibility: hidden?
[05:23:29] <raj> Whirl3d, ^^
[05:23:37] <granden> Hi, couldy ou guys recommend any nice image, handling jquery plugin? For normal cms work? Like cropping, and all that?
[05:23:48] <fuchstronaut> (Cork): yeah thats what i mean :-)
[05:24:03] <granden> or would I need to use a bunch of different plugins and put a set of nice plugins together myself? (Dont mind just wondering).
[05:24:10] <Cork> fuchstronaut: if its a normal inline/block element that should work by it self
[05:24:22] <Xotix> When creating a page what doctype do u use? if you want to support ie8+?
[05:24:31] <sweb> Cork: it's not send my custom request header
[05:24:32] <Cork> fuchstronaut: as long as the parent can stretch for its children
[05:24:33] <sweb> http://pastie.org/private/zz0fmw9jacd0gs2ojahg
[05:24:59] <Cork> sweb: you can't add request hearers for jsonp
[05:25:08] <Cork> sweb: jsonp uses <script> tags
[05:26:02] <Cork> sweb: type is kinda pointless too as jsonp can ONLY be get
[05:26:11] <sweb> Cork: ohh.. ty for guide
[05:26:33] <fuchstronaut> (Cork): thank you, what was what i was looking for, for some reason i thought it should be display: invisible ;-)
[05:27:02] <Cork> lol
[05:27:25] <johnkpaul> Xotix: your doctype doesn't impact supporting or not supporting a browser
[05:27:37] <johnkpaul> using the html5 doctype will put every browser into standard mode
[05:27:50] <fuchstronaut> is there some trickery to make that visibility-thing just work for the width? :P
[05:27:52] <Xotix> johnkpaul but how much sense does it make to use html5 doctype when yo ucan't use the fancy features?
[05:28:01] <Xotix> hm
[05:28:06] <Cork> Xotix: the doctype of html5 is just for that
[05:28:19] <johnkpaul> you don't have to use the fancy features, use what you can
[05:28:19] <Cork> Xotix: html5 wouldn't have a doctype unless it was to trigger strict mode
[05:28:25] <johnkpaul> Xotix: caniuse.com
[05:28:32] <Xotix> so i can use html5 just need to test if the used tags are supported?
[05:28:35] <Xotix> ok thx for that info
[05:28:36] <Cork> fuchstronaut: no
[05:28:38] <Aaronds> Hi, I'm using the autocomplete feature from jquery-ui - does anyone know how I can get the position of the selected element in the source array?
[05:28:55] <fuchstronaut> thanks cork, guess its time to jquery it
[05:29:29] <johnkpaul> Aaronds: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[05:30:31] <Aaronds> johnkpaul, what if I have duplicates in the array?
[05:31:13] <Thoams> Cork: don't know if you read up at all, but I've been through the wringer a bit since earlier... I'm still striving to set the ID of an inserted LI element, http://jsfiddle.net/KNzTM/104/ so that I can drag and drop into the list of interest and update ala http://linssen.me/entry/extending-the-jquery-sortable-with-ajax-mysql/
[05:31:18] <johnkpaul> hmm, then it's an odd autocomplete, IMHO, but then you'd need to get the element itself and use .index()
[05:31:21] <johnkpaul> ?index @Aaronds
[05:31:21] <raj> johnkpaul, actually, come to think of it, do you remember why I even needed to use your fancy pants some_array=$.map(some_array, $) ?
[05:31:21] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[05:31:38] <johnkpaul> raj: nope, I don't remember
[05:32:30] <raj> meh, made sense at the time
[05:32:34] <Aaronds> ok, thanks johnkpaul - one last thing though, what's the deal with getting the selected item from the 'selected' callback? The docs mentioned ui.item, but this simply returns an object. What more should I do?
[05:32:40] <raj> I should have an audio commentary following my code
[05:32:49] <Thoams> drop alert being called twice doesn't matter, solved by using the receive function, but for the life of me I can't get that LI to have an id!
[05:32:51] <raj> or maybe an irc chatlog that correlates
[05:32:52] <Xotix> has anyone experience with ace?
[05:33:04] <johnkpaul> raj: you could look it up in the jquery log if you really wanted to
[05:33:18] <raj> except I wouldn't know when that convo happened
[05:33:19] <Arty2> can we ask questions about snippets here?
[05:33:31] <Arty2> or is it limited to help with the library innards? :)
[05:33:33] <Cork> Thoams: you mean http://jsfiddle.net/KNzTM/105/ ?
[05:33:46] <raj> Arty2, you can ask
[05:33:56] <johnkpaul> Aaronds: I don't know, is ui.item not a domelement?
[05:34:26] <raj> Aaronds, that's from the event
[05:34:46] <Arty2> thanks, see I got this bit: http://pastebin.com/xyRgH7q6
[05:35:11] <raj> Aaronds, it's showing you the ui.item object
[05:35:17] <Thoams> ah, sorry, I did leave a curse in there... frustrated...
[05:35:17] <Arty2> and I cannot seem to find a way to pass $(this) to the JSON handler function
[05:35:28] <raj> you can examine it in your console to figure out what, more specifically, you want
[05:35:34] <Arty2> any help would be greatly appreciated
[05:35:41] <Cork> Thoams: don't really care, just not sure witch one of them you want
[05:36:19] <Thoams> and no, adding mydata wouldn't work because without being able to set the actual id attribute of the element, it doesn't form part of the list which gets sent to my process_upload page
[05:36:29] <laszlof> Arty2: $(this) is only relative to the immediate parent function.
[05:36:42] <Cork> Thoams: data won't ever be able to grab the id
[05:36:57] <laszlof> Arty2: you need to assign it to something else before the getJSON call
[05:36:58] <Arty2> oh that much I figured, but how would one pass the object down, or at least get the value from the handler
[05:37:14] <laszlof> var something = $(this)
[05:37:23] <laszlof> $(something).prepent(data.shares);
[05:37:34] <Cork> *prepend
[05:37:51] <Arty2> oooooh, see I thought I tried that but did not put it inside $(     )
[05:38:01] <Thoams> Cork: Sorry, I think I need a cig and five minutes away from it. Thanks for helping, I'll ask again later if needs be.
[05:38:09] <Arty2> thank you, let me try it
[05:38:19] <Cork> laszlof, Arty2: no need to dubble wrapp like that
[05:38:37] <laszlof> it wont hurt anything
[05:38:43] <Cork> that would be the same as doing $($(this))
[05:38:52] <Cork> laszlof: actually your waisting memory
[05:39:02] <Cork> your creating a new class around your old one
[05:39:07] <otherj> what's the correct way to add data-id to an element? attr('data-id', 'id-5') doesn't seem to work
[05:39:27] <Armern> Whirl3d: Thanks for the help, it works very nicely now, so I'm a happy guy again! ;) I've got to go now though, so take care!
[05:39:29] <Cork> otherj: if you want it on the element thats the way
[05:39:37] <Cork> otherj: and it should work
[05:39:42] <otherj> hm.
[05:39:47] <Haprog> otherj: .data('id', 'mydata')
[05:39:53] <Cork> if you just want to store the data you can use .data
[05:40:03] <Cork> but that won't be an attribute on the dom element
[05:40:05] <otherj> i thought i read that one shouldn't use .data now?
[05:40:17] <otherj> yeah, i need it on the dom element so i can read it
[05:40:17] <Cork> otherj: that depends what you need it for
[05:40:20] <raj> i read that too, but everyone seems to be using it
[05:40:25] <Cork> then ya, attr is what you need
[05:40:46] <otherj> ok. thanks. i'll look at this again -- must be something else that's broken
[05:40:48] <jigal> can anyone tell me what the right selector is for the map button on google maps?
[05:40:54] <Cork> raj: it depends on what you need
[05:40:55] <raj> it's cuz of html5 standards that they were trying to get it to go right on the element for real
[05:41:22] <Cork> raj: .data has the pro that it won't do dom manipulation so its faster and mess leaky in some cases
[05:41:29] <Arty2> hm, still doesn't seem to work
[05:41:36] <thomedy> okay who wants to save me... cuz im stumped
[05:41:40] <raj> Cork, leaky?
[05:41:42] <Cork> mess==less
[05:41:54] <raj> memory-wise?
[05:41:54] <laszlof> Arty2: are you assigning the var before the getJSON call?
[05:41:54] <Cork> raj: yes, old browsers leak things you add to the dom element
[05:41:56] <Cork> yes
[05:42:11] <raj> interesting
[05:42:13] <raj> didn't know that
[05:42:15] <Cork> raj: though its normally a problem of the past
[05:42:39] <Cork> but the speed difference is still true
[05:42:41] <Arty2> laszlof: that's what I got - http://pastebin.com/pwWejkae :/
[05:43:00] <Arty2> I don't get it, unless I'm missing something too obvious here
[05:43:17] <laszlof> you dont appear to have reassigned $(this) as i mentioned
[05:43:29] <Cork> Arty2: this won't work there
[05:43:34] <Cork> for multible reasons
[05:43:41] <Arty2> my bad, this one: http://pastebin.com/en03iNda
[05:43:44] <laszlof> yeah, within the getJSON url, didnt even notice that
[05:43:45] <raj> well, I was gonna stick with .data() anyway, thinking jquery would one day switch over to the dom version
[05:43:52] <thomedy> i keep getting my floated divs to wrap
[05:43:54] <Cork> 1. your using a syncronus loop over an asyncronus call
[05:43:56] <thomedy> and thats bad
[05:44:00] <thomedy> i dont want them to wrap
[05:44:02] <thomedy> at all
[05:44:09] <Cork> 2. this will be the ajax scope, not the each scope
[05:44:41] <Cork> Arty2: does the order of the content added from the loop matter?
[05:45:00] <Arty2> not really
[05:45:15] <MrTool> Hi everyone, is it possible to do json crossDomain requests without jsonp, in the case i create an .htaccess or .php who set Access-Control to "*"
[05:45:45] <laszlof> MrTool: proxy the request through a local PHP script
[05:45:50] <Arty2> unfortunately I haven't worked worked with asynchronous js at all :/
[05:46:05] <johnkpaul> MrTool: yes, you can, but it depends on what browsers you need to support
[05:46:05] <Cork> Arty2: http://pastebin.com/7zyVU9U7
[05:46:19] <MrTool> @johnkpaul: only Chrome at this time
[05:46:31] <johnkpaul> MrTool: then you're fine, look into cross origin resource sharing
[05:46:35] <Cork> Arty2: the order of the added content is totally random though
[05:46:48] <Cork> it all depends on the latency of each call
[05:47:23] <laszlof> Arty2: how is that any different than what he had?
[05:47:26] <MrTool> i do an Ajax Call with CrossDomain: true on an PHP File who loads the json an set in there     header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");     header("Content-type: application/json"); but it wouldn't work
[05:47:47] <Arty2> hm, doesn't work either way, returns no errors
[05:47:59] <laszlof> MrTool: no, just use a local PHP script to serve up the remote json file
[05:48:03] <Cork> MrTool: you don't need crossDomain: true if your using cors
[05:48:09] <laszlof> since the PHP script is local, you wont run into cross domain issues
[05:48:32] <MrTool> its an html app on an terminal, im not able to run php on it
[05:48:43] <laszlof> ah
[05:49:01] <MrTool> but the internet connection of the terminal is very very unstable
[05:49:05] * youngin is now playing: Yesterdays New Quintet - Solar Waves (www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4PnaaaxpU)
[05:49:19] <wltoriginal> Hi all. Quick question: Can anyone explain in a hand wavy kind of way how the .data() method works? How is it associated with an html element if the data is not stored in the dom?
[05:49:39] <thomedy> i could really uses some help keeping this float left div from wrapping
[05:49:45] <MrTool> so i decided to load the ajax file over cross domain if there is an connection and other way load from local resource, but the local resource is not the latest version
[05:50:24] <_trev> There is a data property on the jquery object which stores the value.
[05:50:26] <Cork> wltoriginal: when you call it checks if it has the key in its store, if it doesn't it looks for a data-<your key> on the dom element and imports it
[05:50:46] <_trev> Cork, beat me to it :P
[05:50:54] <Cork> .data never sets anything on the dom
[05:51:47] <johnkpaul> yeah, it only reads from the dom
[05:51:59] <johnkpaul> and it only erads from the dom once, so watch out for bugs around changing attribute
[05:52:05] <johnkpaul> reads* attributes* damn I can't spell today
[05:52:22] <Cork> it only reads from the dom if it doesn't know about the omtion
[05:52:39] <Cork> *know about the key
[05:53:31] <johnkpaul> yes, and also, if you it reads from the dom once, the value is cached, and changing the attribute directly will not change $.data's return value
[05:53:46] <johnkpaul> which has the potential to lead to annoying bugs
[05:54:35] <wltoriginal> Aaah ... Interesting! Thanks for the help all! Lightning fingers there Cork! :)
[05:55:13] <Xotix> if i have  page ssplited into the blocksy: layout, navigation, content (example) and my http request just returns the layout.html with some palceholders for content and navigation, is it bad to load it afterwards via ajax?
[06:03:43] <thomedy> i have a container that is 2x the width of the body so that the inner widths can expand into this but its not working everytime it hits 100% of the window.... it wraps
[06:07:52] <GoGoGarrett> is there a jquery method that is [array].include?(x)
[06:08:27] <penthief> What is the advantage of using $.ajax over XMLHttpRequest?
[06:09:46] <Haprog> isn't that like asking what's the advantage of using jQuery over plain JavaScript?
[06:10:04] <penthief> Haprog: Yes, but for a specific case.
[06:10:13] <otherj> that's a clown question bro
[06:10:26] <penthief> it's a clown answer...
[06:11:06] <Chris_CC> Hi guys .. new to jquery .. i have a form, and i want to run a function once a <button> is pressed... similar to how a <select onchange="fun(this.value)"/> ... what is the correct syntax to use?
[06:12:44] <penthief> I will rephrase the question. I am not convinced that there is a reason to use $.ajax over XMLHttpRequest unless supporting IE6.
[06:13:03] <brunLOL> Chris_CC: The button is pressed down or clicked?
[06:13:27] <Chris_CC> brunLOL: clicked.... i suppose it does'nt need to be a form at all, jsut a link
[06:14:45] <d0ax> xhr
[06:15:13] <penthief> Better solution for IE6 is just to define your own XMLHttpRequest object, no? Using non-standard $.ajax seems pointless. Maybe someone can convince me otherwise, or at least explain this?
[06:15:30] <brunLOL> Chris_CC: $('button').click(function(event) { //code goes here });
[06:16:04] <Chris_CC> brunLOL: ahh ok thanks :) will look into that :)
[06:16:16] <brunLOL> You might want to refine the button selector so it doesn't select EVERY in the DOM
[06:16:22] <brunLOL> *button
[06:16:24] <Xotix> how cna  make a config file available within a js through php?
[06:17:01] <xmaddness> Xotix: We usually set the data-config attribute on the element
[06:17:04] <Haprog> Xotix: depends what format your config file is in and how do you store your configuration..
[06:17:16] <xmaddness> pass everything in through that
[06:17:27] <Haprog> like do you store config in php variables or an array or INI-file or JSON or..
[06:17:54] <Haprog> and don't do what xmaddness said
[06:18:07] <xmaddness> Yeah don't do what a fortune 100 company does
[06:18:08] <xmaddness> its bad
[06:18:43] <xmaddness> anyway, we normally store them in an ini file within zend
[06:18:45] <Haprog> when you have the data in PHP array for example. just json_encode it end echo in a JS variable like <script>var phpdata = <?php ... ?>;</script>
[06:19:02] <xmaddness> =\
[06:19:30] <Xotix> I'm no parsing any template with php. Want to do all the view stuff with JS.  E.g. my index.php doees some dispatching etc etc and returns my layout.html, this layout.html contaans a contentLoader.js (example) which should load e.g. the navigaion block the content block via ajax. And this script needs some information out of a config file which shouldn't be public. :)
[06:19:57] <Haprog> well the data will be public if it ends up in JS
[06:20:11] <Xotix> In Zend, i'd just get the ini stuff, make a json and add it to my view. save it into the dom e.g. (i guess)
[06:20:20] <xmaddness> that what we do
[06:20:53] <xmaddness> and we pass it in via data-* attributes
[06:21:16] <xmaddness> usually in a json
[06:21:24] <BBQ> Any people here with (advanced) jQuery BBQ experience?
[06:21:29] <Xotix> hmm, i could make a config.js and add it to my layout
[06:22:43] <Xotix> hm mthanks got it now :)
[06:25:40] <sunbeam> jhttp://jsfiddle.net/tSFUU/2/ when i access the menu item 'About Us' from below the navigation, the submenu doesn't show up, does anyone know what i can do about this?
[06:27:39] <fuchstronaut> whats the best way to ajax-send a javascript-object to a phpscript and store it in a mysql table?
[06:27:53] <xmaddness> sunbeam: may want to make tyhe selector just nav ul li
[06:28:27] <sunbeam> you mean the mouseenter and mouseleave selector?
[06:28:34] <xmaddness> yeh
[06:28:56] <sunbeam> doesnt change anything
[06:28:59] <xmaddness> hrmm
[06:29:00] <xmaddness> odd
[06:29:02] <sunbeam> http://jsfiddle.net/tSFUU/4/
[06:29:40] <sunbeam> http://jsfiddle.net/tSFUU/5/
[06:30:00] <sunbeam> changed top location, but now when you hover over it from below it appears but dissapears when you access main item
[06:33:17] <fuchstronaut> if i have a json object, how do i make a string out of it and submit it to the server via AJAX?
[06:34:46] <brunLOL> fuchstronaut: JSON.stringify(theobject)
[06:35:24] <fuchstronaut> Im sorry, i dont understand
[06:35:48] <fuchstronaut> object.stringify returns undefined
[06:37:48] <Jon47> fuckstronaut you have to use the "static" method
[06:37:57] <Jon47> it's not a method of "objects" it's a method of the JSON object
[06:38:16] <Jon47> oops fuchstronaut
[06:38:45] <fuchstronaut> isnt a json object a js-object?
[06:38:56] <sunbeam> http://jsfiddle.net/tSFUU/8/ Does anyone know how come that when i access the top menu item with a submenu from below the SECOND time, from then on it dissapears directly after hovering over the main menu item
[06:41:02] <brunLOL> JSON is the string representation of a javascript object afaik.
[06:42:30] <fuchstronaut> how do i make a json-string out of an jsobject then? is there a method?
[06:42:58] <laszlof> JSON.stringify
[06:43:09] <fuchstronaut> what is JSON?
[06:43:23] <xec> it is a global object supplied by your browser :P
[06:43:29] <laszlof> ^
[06:43:31] <xec> like window or document
[06:43:44] <laszlof> var json_txt = JSON.stringify(object);
[06:43:54] <fuchstronaut> ah okey i see
[06:44:18] <fuchstronaut> since JSON is a string, does the server care if i set dataType to string or JSON?
[06:44:32] <xec> ?eval JSON.stringify({ test: "object" })
[06:44:34] <bot-t> xec: "{\"test\":\"object\"}"
[06:44:40] <laszlof> im not sure what you're trying to do
[06:44:55] <xec> fuchstronaut: what is your server
[06:45:32] <fuchstronaut> i want to pass a javascript object to a phpscript that will store that javascript object in a mysql-database
[06:45:40] <fuchstronaut> so i can later load it
[06:47:07] <laszlof> ok
[06:47:21] <laszlof> stringify it, pass it via GET/POST to the php script
[06:47:56] <laszlof> I'd probably not store it as json in the database, but thats just me.
[06:49:29] <fuchstronaut> (laszlof): what would you recoommend?
[06:49:35] <fuchstronaut> instead of JSON
[06:49:42] <laszlof> parse it out and store each value in a separate field
[06:50:59] <Chris_CC> anyone have any idea why my function isn't firing? http://pastebin.com/K23gW4wk .. even when the function does not exist, no errors are returned:(
[06:51:41] <laszlof> because the functionb name is wrong
[06:51:54] <laszlof> fun_comment_get != fun_comment_show
[06:52:20] <Chris_CC> ./fail
[06:52:30] <xec> Chris_CC: you really should stay away from inline javascript though
[06:52:34] <fuchstronaut> As I dont know the number of values and dont have to fiddle around with it serverside, isnt it easier to store it as textblop or something?
[06:52:38] <laszlof> that, as well
[06:52:38] <Chris_CC> ty guys!
[06:52:47] <Chris_CC> inline javascript?
[06:53:01] <xec> Chris_CC: yes, in the html.. like the onclick="" you used there
[06:53:06] <znow> hi ive implemented, autocomplete - though when I enter ex "T" in the text field, all entries appears, and not those starting or having "T" - a screenshot: http://imgur.com/PhD1g and a gist of my code: http://imgur.com/PhD1g <- how can I prevent this?
[06:53:22] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: well, you could store it as a serialized array i suppose. But it will be impossible to search properly
[06:53:29] <xec> you can easily bind to click events using $("button").click(functionName)
[06:53:40] <Chris_CC> xec: so i should use pure jquery by id/class instead of onclick?
[06:54:01] <laszlof> znow: you didnt post the gist
[06:54:05] <xec> Chris_CC: yes - it's always best to separate your javascript from your html
[06:54:11] <thomedy> hey xec i jus tsaw you in the css room
[06:54:12] <znow> laszlof: damn, sorry
[06:54:14] <thomedy> what up
[06:54:15] <znow> sec
[06:54:21] <Chris_CC> xec: why is that if you don't mind me asking, brand new to jquery
[06:54:36] <znow> hi ive implemented, autocomplete - though when I enter ex "T" in the text field, all entries appears, and not those starting or having "T" - a screenshot: http://imgur.com/PhD1g and a gist of my code: https://gist.github.com/9668b2f859aea8e73bf8 <- how can I prevent this? (now with gist) :D
[06:54:38] <laszlof> Chris_CC: its cleaner, easier to read
[06:54:43] <xec> Chris_CC: many reasons, primarily separation of concerns
[06:54:44] <Chris_CC> ahh ok thanks :)
[06:55:05] <Chris_CC> so assign a class to the button and do it by that instead?
[06:55:25] <xec> Chris_CC: but also, you can only ever have one function with the onclick="" method but with .click() bindings you can bind and unbind at will
[06:55:26] <laszlof> znow: my guess is your get_clients.json isnt parsing the request
[06:55:35] <xec> Chris_CC: yes, a class is a good idea
[06:55:36] <znow> laszlof: huh?
[06:55:54] <Chris_CC> thanks xec :)
[06:55:59] <laszlof> if you're using source like that, you should be doing the filtering in your script
[06:56:36] <xec> Chris_CC: if you're new you should give this a read too: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[06:57:01] <znow> laszlof: hmm enlighten me please :)
[06:57:21] <fuchstronaut> (laszlof): http://pastebin.com/22kRADS5 <- arguments[0] is an empty array, shouldnt it be my json object?
[06:57:24] <Chris_CC> xec:  ty will look into that
[06:57:27] * xec waves to thomedy
[06:57:42] <laszlof> znow: your get_clients.json is passed the request object. There should be a "terms" string that goes with that. You need to filter the results within get_clients.json so it only returns matching data
[06:58:04] <sunbeam> i have a strange issue
[06:58:09] <sunbeam> $("ul > li").mouseenter(function(){ // .. }
[06:58:09] <thomedy> as it turns out it may have been my jquery that provides an easier fix im working on it right now because the table layout didn't realy have any benefit
[06:58:09] <sunbeam> versus
[06:58:17] <sunbeam> $("header nav ul > li").mouseenter(function(){ // .. }
[06:58:35] <sunbeam> if the header nav ul li structure exists, whats the difference between the 2 functional? nothing right
[06:58:44] <znow> laszlof: hmm... get_clients.json is an array of label and values... the jquery autocomplete should take care of the filtering?
[06:59:03] <laszlof> znow: you'd think so, but I dont think it does if you're fetching a source like that
[06:59:12] <znow> laszlof: like http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#typeahead
[07:02:21] <laszlof> znow: read the autocomplete docs
[07:02:31] <laszlof> the last section on the page
[07:02:35] <laszlof> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[07:02:56] <laszlof> A response callback, which expects a single argument to contain the data to suggest to the user. This data should be filtered based on the provided term,...
[07:03:19] <laszlof> it will only auto-filter if a local array is used
[07:03:27] <fuchstronaut> (laszlof): http://pastebin.com/22kRADS5 <- arguments[0] is an empty array, shouldnt it be my json object?
[07:03:56] <znow> laszlof: okay... hmm.... so...
[07:04:03] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: where is arguments coming from?
[07:04:19] <fuchstronaut> from the passed function
[07:04:26] <fuchstronaut> arguments[0] is data
[07:04:27] <laszlof> i dont see it defined anywhere
[07:04:59] <fuchstronaut> i just logged arguments to see if the textStatus and jqXHR is beeing returned
[07:05:30] <fuchstronaut> just think of arguments as data which is passed by the function
[07:05:51] <znow> laszlof: well, how would I filter in my method? my method is just getting all rows from client and taking name and id, and render a json file
[07:06:12] <laszlof> znow: you'll have to do that in your rails app
[07:06:28] <laszlof> there should be a "terms" argument passed to the script
[07:06:39] <laszlof> and you'll want to use that to filter your results how you see fit
[07:07:04] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: im still not understanding what arguments has to do with anything
[07:07:29] <fuchstronaut> arguments[0] is data
[07:07:39] <fuchstronaut> which should point to my JSON
[07:07:50] <laszlof> how is arguments[0] data? its not defined anywhere
[07:08:04] <laszlof> console.log(data) is what you want
[07:08:09] <fuchstronaut> its the same
[07:08:19] <laszlof> not according to the paste you posted
[07:08:22] <fuchstronaut> in JS arguments is an array containing all parameters of an function
[07:08:36] <_trev> It's technically not an array ;)
[07:08:47] <fuchstronaut> (_trev): it feels like one ;-)
[07:09:16] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: you're likely not passing the json data correctly
[07:09:49] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: var args = 'data='+JSON.stringify(object);
[07:10:03] <laszlof> $.post('foo.php', args, ...
[07:10:08] <laszlof> or something like that
[07:10:21] <laszlof> I'd advise using .ajax instead of the shorthand until you have it sorted out
[07:10:57] <fuchstronaut> well now it works..
[07:11:02] <fuchstronaut> i dont get this....
[07:11:31] <fuchstronaut> making 'json='+save_json out of save_json
[07:11:52] <Posterdati> hi
[07:12:24] <fuchstronaut> what do i have to do to get in php $_POST['json'] my JSON object?
[07:12:46] <laszlof> $data = $_POST['json'];
[07:12:51] <Posterdati> where could I download dimensions plugins?
[07:13:03] <Posterdati> I need it for jquery tooltip
[07:13:21] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: since you're just storing it in the database theres no need to convert it into a php object
[07:13:35] <fuchstronaut> no
[07:13:37] <fuchstronaut> am i doing this?
[07:13:37] <elegos> hello! I've got a strange problem. I'd check whenever I've got a class or not on an element (.hasClass("className"))... but it always return true, even if the element doesn't have it... http://uni.elegosproject.org/search.php - bottom of the page. What's wrong? Thanks
[07:14:15] <elegos> ah, stpid error <.<
[07:16:48] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: im not exactly sure what you're asking
[07:17:09] <fuchstronaut> you said i shoulnt make a php object out of it
[07:17:14] <fuchstronaut> i dont think i am doing this
[07:17:42] <laszlof> right. your question before that though
[07:17:48] <fuchstronaut> All i want is to pass that jsobject as string in a post (plus some additional things, like values from input fields)
[07:17:54] <laszlof> you kinda answered it yourself, so I assumed you were trying to convert it in some way
[07:18:12] <Xotix> How mcuh sense does it make to load all content via ajax rather then putting it together serverside?
[07:18:26] <Goopyo> Q: I am trying to replace a div with another using fadeout and fadein. I put the fadein into the callback of the fadeout function but it still seems to be coming in before the fadeout is compeltely done. Any ideas?
[07:18:35] <fuchstronaut> but i really dont understand how that ajax thing is working
[07:18:49] <sunbeam> http://jsfiddle.net/fZR5G/5/ Does anyone know why on this submenu under 'About Us' in IE7 the width of the nav menu items is variable and not 100% (like stated in the css and working in the other browsers) ?
[07:18:50] <fuchstronaut> my callback-success function is not firing at all it seems
[07:19:03] <laszlof> Goopyo: $('.someclass').fadeout(1000).fadeIn(1000);
[07:19:27] <laszlof> or, you want to replace it with a different image
[07:20:12] <Goopyo> laszlof: this is what I am using: http://pastebin.com/nrbAL2V4
[07:22:57] <laszlof> Goopyo: you're missing a closing bracket
[07:23:26] <Goopyo> shitty paste. its there
[07:24:06] <laszlof> http://jsfiddle.net/R4Epq/1/
[07:24:08] <laszlof> seems to work fine
[07:25:43] <Goopyo> yeah it does. Im testing one now too
[07:26:04] <fRAiLtY-> Guys, I'm using power zoom on my image (just hover your mouse on the product image) but for some reason the magnifier hides behind the image? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[07:26:19] <fRAiLtY-> I've given an z-index:2 as  instructed earlier but no luck :X
[07:28:44] <fuchstronaut> is it even possible to pass mixed type of data to a server (php)?
[07:29:01] <fuchstronaut> so i have $_POST['json'] = js-object, $_POST['name'] = string??
[07:29:54] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: once its posted, its all a string
[07:30:01] <laszlof> regardless of what you send
[07:30:21] <laszlof> $_POST is an array of strings
[07:30:48] <fuchstronaut> yea..
[07:30:53] <fuchstronaut> but i mean sending it via ajax
[07:31:02] <laszlof> it doesnt matter how you send it
[07:31:06] <laszlof> posted data is always strings
[07:31:09] <fuchstronaut> why do i have the choice then?
[07:31:20] <laszlof> what do you mean?
[07:31:27] <fuchstronaut> i can set a datatype
[07:31:29] <laszlof> you mean dataType?
[07:31:32] <fuchstronaut> yes
[07:31:44] <laszlof> thats for the response
[07:32:34] <laszlof> for example, if you set it to json, you'll need to send back a valid json response from your PHP script
[07:32:51] <laszlof> something like print json_encode(array('status'=>'success'));
[07:33:07] <laszlof> then you can evaluate data.status in the success callback
[07:33:48] <fuchstronaut> i cant get my successcallback to fire for shit
[07:34:07] <laszlof> did you get rid of the shorthand code and use .ajax?
[07:34:26] <fuchstronaut> http://pastebin.com/GC9z1XM1
[07:34:28] <fuchstronaut> yes
[07:34:39] <NoiseEee> fuchstronaut: "succuess" ?
[07:34:47] <fuchstronaut> lol
[07:34:55] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: you dont need parseJSON either
[07:34:58] <laszlof> in the success object
[07:35:00] <thomedy> okay i think i know how i can solve this now
[07:35:03] <laszlof> erm, success callback
[07:35:06] <thomedy> not with css but with jquery
[07:35:08] <thomedy> maybe
[07:35:36] <laszlof> since you have the dataType set to json, it will automatically parse the response as a json string into an object
[07:36:21] <fuchstronaut> ok
[07:36:27] <fuchstronaut> thank you, you really helped me out
[07:36:38] <fuchstronaut> starting to understand now how it works
[07:36:53] <Goopyo> laszlof can you check this out? http://jsfiddle.net/R4Epq/3/
[07:37:14] <fuchstronaut> do i have to set the header in my php script ?
[07:37:23] <Goopyo> it fades out, input appears on bottom of the fadeout and then it slides up
[07:37:32] <fuchstronaut> and then echo json_encode( $array );
[07:38:02] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: it wouldnt hurt, though i think its typically recognized properly by ajax calls
[07:38:53] <laszlof> fuch set the style to float
[07:38:56] <laszlof> oops
[07:39:03] <laszlof> Goopyo: set the style to float in the right place
[07:41:29] <Goopyo> laszlof: can you clearify?
[07:41:45] <fuchstronaut> brb
[07:42:10] <laszlof> Goopyo: both the box and text box are blocking. You want to float them so they appear in the same space
[07:43:20] <Goopyo> k. Ill figure it out
[07:44:17] <adept-phil> hi all
[07:44:36] <adept-phil> anyone pretty clued up on fixing jQuery conflicts?
[07:45:13] <thomedy> okay im stuck again this is the last stuck i need to fix before i move on to setting up the css for the layout of my site
[07:45:20] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[07:45:25] <thomedy> my animations are all good save one
[07:45:29] <thomedy> i am still getting a wrap
[07:45:43] <thomedy> my float left on the final div pushes me to the next line
[07:45:46] <thomedy> not good
[07:46:06] <thomedy> thesartorer.com
[07:46:26] <koiti> hy. i am looking for a way to print something with jquery. i know that there are a lot of plugins, but i need one which can print without the dialog in the IE 9
[07:46:37] <koiti> how can i do that?
[07:47:50] <MoonSerenity> adept-phil, is it conflicting with other js librabies?
[07:47:55] <laszlof> koiti: i dont think you can bypass the print dialog
[07:48:01] <laszlof> i'd be concerned if you could
[07:48:40] <rroelofs> koiti: you will need a browser specific extensioin and it has nothing to do with jquery
[07:48:42] <adept-phil> MoonSerenity: I'm not sure, I believe so
[07:48:55] <koiti> yeah me too :D but maybe there could be a way with activx elements. but i dont know a lot about them laszlof
[07:49:13] <laszlof> sounds like a question for #activex :)
[07:49:19] <MoonSerenity> adept-phil, are you using $() or jQuery()
[07:49:21] <koiti> :D
[07:49:31] <koiti> rroelofs so you mean i have to get a plugin?
[07:49:52] <rroelofs> yes.  since you are in ie land, activex is your best bet
[07:50:19] <adept-phil> Well the client has a core js file using $() and they are using the civikuk cookiecontrol script which uses jquery(). Either work stand alone, but not together
[07:50:47] <koiti> ok thank you!
[07:50:54] <laszlof> adept-phil: have you checked http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[07:50:56] <koiti> so i have to learn activex :)
[07:51:06] <laszlof> good luck with that
[07:51:11] <adept-phil> yes thanks laszlof :)
[07:51:13] <laszlof> and may god have mercy on your soul
[07:51:15] <MoonSerenity> adept-phil, http://snipplr.com/view/65566/testing-jquery-and-make-it-nonconflicting/
[07:51:57] <rroelofs> koiti: nope, just find an activex control that does what you want and follow the install directions
[07:52:04] <adept-phil> cheers MoonSerenity , I've tried replacing all instances of $() with jQuery() however it still doesn't work
[07:52:21] <MoonSerenity> adept-phil, do the 2nd example
[07:52:43] <adept-phil> will try :)
[07:52:48] <adept-phil> I'll letr you know how I get on
[07:52:51] <rroelofs> adept-phil: are both libs including their own copy of jquery?
[07:52:58] <thomedy> i have no idea waht to do here
[07:54:20] <adept-phil> rroelofs: one checks to see if if(typeof(jQuery)=="undefined" and then includes it if not. We're using jQuery 1.7.1
[07:55:10] <koiti> ok thank you i will join #activex :D
[07:59:02] <rroelofs> adept-phil: when both libs are loaded, what does jQuery.fn.jquery return
[08:08:12] <outsmartin> hello
[08:09:18] <outsmartin> im using $.inArray(id,localStorage.getObject("merkliste")) to find out if a id is in my array
[08:09:25] <outsmartin> this works fine in the chrome console
[08:09:38] <outsmartin> but somehow in my code it doesnt even if i use the exact same values
[08:15:42] <zamba> is there some caveat when using .removeData()?
[08:15:42] <lilred> how important are callbacks in day-to-day jquery
[08:15:49] <zamba> i'm finding that it basically doesn't work with me
[08:16:32] <zamba> doing: console.log($(this).data('id')); $(this).removeData('id'); console.log($(this).data('id')); .. and both outputs show the same value
[08:17:38] <thomedy> if anyone gets time im stumped www.thesartorer.com   im trying to remove the white space from my animation its due to a div that wraps and that s not what i want
[08:17:40] <bloof> if you wanna remove the id why not do .attr("id","")
[08:17:50] <thomedy> i have tried several ideas but i got nothing that works yet
[08:18:25] <zamba> bloof: but shouldn't .removeData() actually work?
[08:19:27] <bloof> im not sure, havent messed with that
[08:19:55] <zamba> well, .attr() doesn't work either
[08:20:00] <zamba> the value is still the same afterwards
[08:20:04] <zamba> read-only DOM? :)
[08:20:14] <bloof> lol
[08:22:12] <bloof> .removeData(this,"id")
[08:22:21] <bloof> $.
[08:25:21] <toddWork_> i'm making an ajax request (JSON) to the twitter api and my query gets cancelled. how can i capture that?
[08:25:49] <toddWork_> i need to capture status:(canceled)
[08:26:21] <toddWork_> and how do i find out what is canceling it? is it chrome? anybody deal w/ this?
[08:27:01] <sente> use the developer tools and insepect the http response?
[08:27:18] <toddWork_> sente: that's what i'm looking at. response is canceled.
[08:28:03] <toddWork_> sente: i guess it never gets sent.
[08:28:14] <sente> so you send the request
[08:28:17] <sente> and just never get a response
[08:28:25] <sente> not even a error response code?
[08:28:39] <toddWork_> sente: no, i think it's being canceled before it is sent.
[08:28:57] <sente> are you authenticated?
[08:29:03] <sente> what's the request you're making
[08:29:05] <sente> yada yada
[08:29:26] <toddWork_> yeah, i can make 200 (1 per second) requests that are solid and then 1 is cancelled.
[08:29:39] <toddWork_> so i want to capture that cancelled request, wait 5 seconds and try again.
[08:30:04] <toddWork_> but i'm not sure what is cancelling it. my thought is that chrome is cancelling it for some reason because there is no ajax error returning.
[08:32:03] <sente> https://twitter.com/account/rate_limit_status.xml
[08:32:11] <sente> what's  that show
[08:33:42] <zamba> bloof: nope
[08:33:47] <zamba> bloof: didn't work either
[08:35:18] <toddWork_> sente: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1040980/
[08:36:06] <toddWork_> sente: it seems ok. 150 limit w/ 150 left?
[08:36:53] <fuchstronaut> is there a limitation to post-data length?
[08:37:15] <laszlof> yes
[08:37:30] <fuchstronaut> depending on the server?
[08:37:30] <NoiseEee> toddWork_:  you're hitting that page the same way / smae source as your xhr?  anyways you can see that Twitter limits how often you can hit the API and get a response.  200 is beyond your hourly max.
[08:37:36] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: yeah, its a php setting
[08:37:38] <laszlof> post_max_size
[08:37:43] <fuchstronaut> ok thanks
[08:37:45] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: "api abuse" is what its called :D
[08:37:54] <fuchstronaut> is it likely i will exceed it not uploading files?
[08:38:37] <laszlof> fuchstronaut: default is 8M I think
[08:38:40] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: sente: i've been rate-limited?
[08:38:48] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: *everyone* is rate limited
[08:39:06] <fuchstronaut> it's 8M on my localhost at least :P
[08:39:14] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: how do i interpret that xml status page from above?
[08:40:04] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: interpret?
[08:40:22] <panzi> how do you display a placeholder text in an empty jquery ui sortable?
[08:40:45] <panzi> I dont mean the placeholder whitespace when you drag something. I mean if the list is empty
[08:40:47] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: to me, it reads: "you are not being throttled, you have 150 hits remaining this hour" but you are saying that i'm being limited?
[08:41:22] <gkunno> hello! I have a flipbox style function and i would want to eliminate the multiple click "spam" on the function, the idea would be that after the function is activated you could not run the function again untill it has finished. Full example on: http://jsfiddle.net/ZnYx7/6/
[08:43:17] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: you're telling me you're sending 200 requests at 1 per second?
[08:43:42] <laszlof> and this is the reason the rate limit is in place to begin with
[08:44:09] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: again.. API abuse.  twitter, nor other online services, are not keen on you replicating their stuff on your site as you see fit.
[08:44:25] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: no. not really. send 1 request, get the return w/ the next page number, wait one second, send the next request w/ the new page number until there are no more pages; twitter stops at about a week. i
[08:44:37] <toddWork_> i believe that is how you properly do search.
[08:44:47] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: twitter would prefer you search on their own site.
[08:45:10] <toddWork_> i think think twitter is limiting me because they would return an error saying "enhance your calm. . ." but, i think chrome is cancelling my request.
[08:45:22] <toddWork_> *dont think twitter.
[08:45:28] <NoiseEee> chrome doesn't cancel requests on its own
[08:45:35] <toddWork_> ok, good to know.
[08:45:42] <NoiseEee> iirc twitter just will not send a response
[08:46:05] <NoiseEee> which is completely different than an xhr/.ajax "failure"
[08:46:17] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: they send a response if you get throttled.
[08:46:31] <Goopyo> how do you fadein something with a display of inline-block?
[08:46:59] <Goopyo> oh it restores it to what it was previously
[08:46:59] <Goopyo> c
[08:47:00] <Goopyo> oo
[08:47:04] <Goopyo> cool*
[08:47:26] <gabejacobs> Since no one is answering in the #jquerymobile page, I'd thought I'd try here. I'm having problems combining jquery mobile and mediaelements.js http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11016957/jquery-mobile-and-mediaelements-js
[08:47:26] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: and then they block your IP for an hour or so.
[08:47:40] <NoiseEee> toddWork_: this will help you figure out whats going on / wrong: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[08:47:43] <toddWork_> that isn't what is happening here.
[08:47:45] <gabejacobs> I think the css of jquery mobile is getting tangled with the mediaelements css. What do you guys think?
[08:48:03] <toddWork_> NoiseEee: thank you. i'll check it out.
[08:49:50] <simon> hi. I'm trying to change the layout of the closing X-button in a jQuery dialog. I wonder if it makes sense to place the X within the iframe, and if there are cross-site implications to that.
[08:50:21] <thomedy> if anyone could help me get my animate{width} to not cause my divs to wrap i would be greatly appreciative
[08:52:32] <gabejacobs> Anyone able to look at that stackoverflow?
[08:54:29] <laszlof> gabejacobs: if you think you have overriding styles, inspect the element with safari element inspector. it will show the exact styles that are being applied.
[08:56:15] <hewhocutsdown> this is more of a general javascript question. I'm performing a GET and receiving an XML file. I convert that into a Javascript object with three properties, and then take two of those properties and insert HTML into a webpage.
[08:56:35] <hewhocutsdown> it's a name/value on the webpage. If a user edits the value, I need to POST
[08:56:57] <hewhocutsdown> but with *all three* values. What's the best way to make the POST aware of the already existing Javascript object?
[08:58:49] <simon> how do I change the semi-transparent color that jquery-ui dialogs use?
[08:59:27] <zoned> thomedy, what do you mean not get them to wrap?
[09:00:58] <zoned> hewhocutsdown, don't you have the "three properties" as JS variables? $.post({data: {var1, var2, var3}, ..});
[09:01:18] <thomedy> when i start the anim, the width of the combined container divs is too great i would imagine for the window... so the last div moves to the bottom
[09:01:21] <thomedy> no bueno
[09:01:31] <thomedy> i want it to stay where it is and fill it in
[09:01:37] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[09:01:52] <zamba> bloof: here's my case: http://jsfiddle.net/sQMwb/
[09:02:04] <zoned> thomedy, what's the problem here? looks fine to me
[09:02:21] <zamba> bloof: try clicking the different cells.. it's basically a swap of the content and then the id (if it exists)
[09:02:40] <thomedy> if you click on of the links and watch it animate youll see that one div floats to the bottom... let me do something reall quick and
[09:02:51] <zoned> ah i see
[09:02:52] <thomedy> ill tell you when you can click the link again one sec please
[09:03:28] <lilred> jQuery UI CSS documentation: ".ui-helper-clearfix: Applies float wrapping properties to parent elements"
[09:03:37] <lilred> Can someone explain like I'm five?
[09:03:50] <thomedy> okay there you go..
[09:03:55] <thomedy> thats the version im non right now
[09:03:56] <thomedy> on right now
[09:04:18] <gabejacobs> laszlof: I found that theres a class in the jquery mobile css called .ui-btn-hidden that is screwing with it. Removing that screws up other things though. Is there a way to not apply the css to the mediaelements?
[09:04:23] <thomedy> i really really really am stumped here
[09:04:38] <zoned> thomedy, i really don't understand what is supposed to happen
[09:04:50] <zoned> i click men's suits, animates fine
[09:05:00] <thomedy> ummm... what i want is for as the slides to either open or shut revealing what part of the site your on...
[09:05:00] <truk77> Is there any simple way to display a 'page loading' window while initial inititializations take place?
[09:05:02] <zoned> then i click women, animates fine
[09:05:21] <thomedy> i want no div wrapping but 100% of the screen filled with no white space at all
[09:05:28] <thomedy> and not over either
[09:05:37] <zamba> women? where?
[09:05:42] <zamba> animated women?
[09:05:51] <NoiseEee> truk77: animated gif that you hide when done
[09:05:54] <thomedy> wait is it just my machine.... i have an outdated machine im workin giwth
[09:06:06] <thomedy> cuz im not a pro yet im just learning as fast as possible
[09:06:13] <zamba> can someone explain to me why .removeData() isn't doing its job?
[09:07:13] <NoiseEee> maybe its unmotivated
[09:07:13] <truk77> NoiseEee: Any examples you can point me to?
[09:07:16] <thomedy> what browser are you using
[09:07:24] <gabejacobs> laszlof: ideas?
[09:08:10] <laszlof> gabejacobs: not without modifying the stylesheets of either jqm or the other one
[09:08:24] <laszlof> you could assign a style based on the ID for it
[09:08:34] <laszlof> that might override the default class style
[09:08:49] <laszlof> you just need to make it more specific than whatever style definition that its using
[09:08:55] <gabejacobs> how exactly should I go about that
[09:09:02] <gabejacobs> create an idea for the audio tag?
[09:09:09] <gabejacobs> Not sure if that will do the trick
[09:09:21] <laszlof> im not really a CSS expert
[09:09:40] <NoiseEee> zamba: http://jsfiddle.net/Sh3L5/
[09:09:41] <sunbeam> The effect of an image scroller like this here: http://www.geenstijl.nl/#a3029811 - how can i best achieve this? does anyone know a good plugin for it?
[09:09:46] <NoiseEee> zamba: next time make your own
[09:10:20] <zamba> NoiseEee: make my own what?
[09:10:48] <ogk1000> if I want to find '-' and replace it as ' - ' how do I do that?
[09:11:11] <NoiseEee> truk77: $(function() { $('#idOfDivHoldingAnimatedGif').hide(); })
[09:11:16] <zamba> NoiseEee: that works, yeah.. but why isn't my jsfiddle working?
[09:11:20] <NoiseEee> zamba: proof of it not working
[09:11:28] <NoiseEee> zamba: sorry didnt see a jsfiddle!
[09:11:39] <thomedy> seriously? nothing is working wtf
[09:11:39] <zamba> http://jsfiddle.net/sQMwb/
[09:12:05] <zamba> NoiseEee: no.. /2/ on that.. i've added a couple of console.log() there
[09:12:19] <laszlof> ogk1000: string2 = string1.replace('-', ' - ');
[09:12:54] <zamba> NoiseEee: try just clicking on each cell in the left column and move them to the adjacent right column.. and see that the data isn't removed
[09:13:28] <JonYoder> Hey! I have a really simple question about doing a hover event with jQuery. I'm trying to manipulate a div within a div.
[09:13:30] <NoiseEee> zamba: iirc removeData is for removal of data set with .data,  not with inline data- attributes
[09:13:31] <JonYoder> This is my code: $j('div.container').mouseover(function(){$j('div.tomanipulate', this).css('opacity', '0.5')})
[09:13:48] <zamba> NoiseEee: aha
[09:13:53] <zamba> NoiseEee: that explains it
[09:14:14] <zamba> .removeAttr()
[09:14:26] <truk77> Ah, simpler than I thought...thanks NoiseEee
[09:14:34] <zamba> but i hacked it by just adding data-id="-1" to the cells that has no data
[09:14:35] <zamba> that worked
[09:14:51] <zamba> and then just set the value to -1 instead of actually removing them
[09:15:01] <zamba> so i'm good! :)
[09:16:15] <JonYoder> I'm somehow selecting the div with $this incorrectly as instead of just dimming the one div, it dims all the divs on the page.
[09:17:07] <bloof> JonYoder: you will need to select the correct div more accurately
[09:17:46] <bloof> clearly ur this isnt g00d enough ;[]
[09:18:06] <JonYoder> true! I'm just not sure where the error is.
[09:19:10] <JonYoder> My code is <div class="container"><div class="manipulate">lala</div></div>, so I just want to manipulate the contained class.
[09:19:54] <thomedy> is it hackish to short sheet the width in order to get my animation width or is that a professional move
[09:21:35] <ogk1000> laszlof, you ther?
[09:22:07] <ogk1000> or anyone really.. any idea why this would delete all the text instead of update? http://collabedit.com/22nj7
[09:22:46] <JonYoder> bloof: do you see how I'm selecting wrong with $this?
[09:23:22] <bloof> $(this) ? im not sure
[09:23:56] <ogk1000> does .val work to grab text content?
[09:30:43] <JonYoder> bloof: thanks for your help! I'm an idiot and had some div names mixed up. :|
[09:30:59] <bloof> np :)
[09:33:37] <deitarion> What is "this" bound to in the complete callback of a $.get() request? (And is it the same thing in callbacks bound via done(), fail(), and always()?)
[09:34:51] <deitarion> I checked the docs forboth jQuery.ajax() and jQuery.get() but couldn't find any mention of it.
[09:37:17] <thomedy> im out of ideas honestly
[09:44:20] <asher^> hi all, anyone know how i can turn off the title bar in a jquery ui dialog?
[09:46:17] <goldstar> hey guys, is it possible to manipulate the iframe content of a foreign domain in a webpage ?
[09:47:38] <arungpt> goldstar: do you need to grab the content from the page each time?
[09:47:45] <arungpt> or can you host the html yourself?
[09:48:05] <arungpt> and maybe update it periodically
[09:48:21] <goldstar> arungpt: im using wufoo on my website, I need to know when the user has pressed the submit button so I can run conversion code etc
[09:48:27] <arungpt> ah
[09:48:32] <arungpt> im sure wufoo has a callback?
[09:49:04] <goldstar> arungpt: it does, but that callback only submits data to a predefined URL
[09:50:00] <arungpt> goldstar: does this help? http://help.wufoo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6395/~/web-hooks-are-user-defined-callbacks-over-http.
[09:50:49] <zenocon> anyone here using an http proxy?  i tried to deploy socketstream app behind apache with proxy mod and the websocket fails miserably
[09:51:14] <zenocon> oops. sorry, wrong room...ignore
[09:51:40] <goldstar> arungpt: already tried that. Basically, I had to create a script and then a webhook that would redirect back to that script. That is fine, but with conversion tracking it wont work
[09:51:55] <arungpt> goldstar: sorry mate im out of ideas
[09:52:22] <chilversc> goldstar: why do you need to create a script and callback like that? sounds like something is wrong in the design?
[09:52:37] <chilversc> goldstar: why is your website creating a script for one thing?
[09:52:47] <goldstar> chilversc: thats the way the wufoo webhook works
[09:53:17] <goldstar> chilversc: I create the script, on a successful form submission wufoo sends the form data to the script andI insert into database
[09:53:18] <chilversc> goldstar: right, so wufoo calls your specific url to say, something has happened, at that point you can process it however you like?
[09:53:51] <chilversc> goldstar: that's your problem then, that sounds like an odd design, why are you creating a script that inserts data?
[09:53:52] <TheSisb> I'm working on a jQuery plugin to turn i<nput type='range' >s into sliders over here: http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU
[09:54:06] <TheSisb> I'm currently struggling with having it only bind the events once, after the each is complete
[09:54:10] <TheSisb> is there any way to do this?
[09:54:12] <chilversc> goldstar: won't that create a script per user, every time they use that form?
[09:54:40] <goldstar> chilversc: no it wont. Its one script, one link that wufoo posts all form data to
[09:55:01] <chilversc> goldstar: I'm on about the design your side
[09:55:23] <goldstar> chilversc: no it doesnt create a script per form
[09:55:55] <chilversc> goldstar: so what's the problem? I seem to be missing something here?
[09:57:19] <goldstar> chilversc: the webhook works fine for grabbing user form data and storing it. But I need to manage affliate and conversion tracking. That can only happen on the user's end because of all the relevant cookies
[10:00:01] <chilversc> goldstar: ok, so how does the wufoo iframe get added to your site for a specific user? ie, do you have a single wufoo account that every client's forms exist in or an account per client?
[10:00:54] <goldstar> chilversc: a single wufoo account with all the forms. The forms are put on our website, we are the user
[10:01:20] <chilversc> goldstar: so you make the forms on behalf of the client then
[10:02:04] <goldstar> chilversc: yes and we host them on our website
[10:04:48] <chilversc> goldstar: so I guess the user signs in to your site, but the form they fill out in wufoo has no link back to that specific user
[10:05:14] <goldstar> chilversc: no
[10:06:01] <chilversc> goldstar: so you don't care about the specific user? only which client owned the form?
[10:06:29] <Posterdati> hi
[10:06:36] <chilversc> ah you do care about the specific user, but that user is essentually anonymous
[10:08:46] <KWhat_Work> is it possible to check inheritance of a widget?
[10:09:15] <chilversc> goldstar: I guess you don't actually know anything about the user such as their email address? so you can't ask them for an email address in the form to corralate the form with your user
[10:09:30] <goldstar> chilversc: correct, basically, I need to user's cookies otherwise the tracking will not work
[10:10:21] <chilversc> goldstar: yeah, I'm not seeing anything in wufoo that will support this, currently the only thing I can think of is best guess, ie, user from IP ... was accessing your site around the same time a form was submitted from that same IP
[10:10:28] <d3f4ultr0> good morning folks, how do I call set_welcome_screen_visiblity() in my .continue code? http://pastebin.com/gY9e5mwP
[10:10:56] <chilversc> goldstar: I'd raise a support ticket with them asking if there's a way you could embed a unique token in the request url for a form, that is then recorded in their DB along with the data
[10:11:16] <goldstar> chilversc: thanks will do that
[10:12:04] <chilversc> goldstar: though such a change might take a while to implement, but in the current design there's no way to support this
[10:13:05] <d3f4ultr0> anyone please?
[10:13:25] <chilversc> goldstar: oh hey, maybe this would work http://www.wufoo.com/2011/05/20/uberforms-how-to-seamlessly-stitch-large-wufoo-forms-together/
[10:14:17] <d3f4ultr0> will this work folks
[10:14:20] <d3f4ultr0> 				$('.continue').click(function () {                     set_welcome_screen_visibility() 					$('.welcomebox').dialog("close"); 					$('#window_0').show(); 				});
[10:14:37] <d3f4ultr0> forgot the ;
[10:14:47] <chilversc> goldstar: the principle is the same, only rather than liking 2 forms together, your linking an "entry id" you create on your site in your database with the form
[10:15:30] <fsd> d3f4ultr0: it should... why dont you try it and see
[10:15:38] <d3f4ultr0> k, trying
[10:16:46] <d3f4ultr0> fsd: no errors. What are some firefox add-in that I can use to check cookie?
[10:17:02] <simon> I've got a jquery-ui dialog, and I want to position the upper-right X-close link so that it isn't above everything within the iframe. doesn't it make the most sense to place it on top of the iframe, but external to the iframe?
[10:17:26] <goldstar> chilversc: thanks
[10:17:35] <simon> (that is, overlapping with absolute positioning or so)
[10:17:40] <fsd> d3f4ultr0: DeveloperTools
[10:17:59] <d3f4ultr0> oh, looks like i have it installed
[10:18:11] <KWhat_Work> anyone?
[10:18:40] <fsd> d3f4ultr0: Go to Cookies -> view cookie info
[10:18:47] <d3f4ultr0> YAY, it's there :D
[10:18:53] <fsd> woot
[10:18:56] <d3f4ultr0> my code worked!!!
[10:19:03] <simon> KWhat_Work, inheritance of a widget? have you considered looking at the prototype of whatever inherits?
[10:19:52] <Posterdati> hi
[10:20:05] <d3f4ultr0> now, I have another jquery code that displays the welcome box. I'll pastebin the code. I know how to check the cookie but how will I include it to this code? One sec
[10:20:36] <Posterdati> I'm using jquery dialog, when I try to drag a simple dialog it goes out of the page
[10:20:54] <d3f4ultr0> this is the code that gets run everytime the page is called - http://pastebin.com/HfrVncU4
[10:21:15] <Posterdati> I can only move it on the width axis
[10:21:27] <d3f4ultr0> i would like to prevent it from displaying when the cookie welcomescreen is in effect. Where do I put the code?
[10:21:42] <d3f4ultr0> cookie name is donoshowwelcomescreen
[10:22:43] <fsd> d3f4ultr0: you'll need to look at the documentation for the cookie plugin you're using and thenuse a conditional of the cookie val
[10:23:00] <eldereko1> is it possible to bind an event to an elements creation
[10:23:07] <d3f4ultr0> fsd, I was thinking of wrapping that code with an IF condition statement
[10:23:12] <d3f4ultr0> maybe, I'll try it
[10:24:25] <fsd> d3f4ultr0: try first, then ask. better way to learn
[10:24:28] <sunbeam> The effect of an image scroller like this here: http://www.geenstijl.nl/#a3029811 - how can i best achieve this? does anyone know a good plugin for it?
[10:24:46] <ep0ch> does anyone know of an example jquery forum I could look at? something lightweight if possible...googling like crazy and not finding anything
[10:26:09] <fsd> ep0ch.. what kind of backend are you lookingfor?
[10:26:53] <arungpt> I'm using jquery to insert a link into a page. i want that link to open in an iframe but can't figure out where to put the javascript to accomplish this
[10:26:56] <ep0ch> fsd, php mysql
[10:27:07] <arungpt> putting it on the page doesnt work because the link is being created afterwards
[10:27:33] <ep0ch> fsd users on my site pointstackers.com are hounding me for a forum and i dont want to use some bloated phpBB or equivalent...
[10:27:46] <ep0ch> id rather incorporate it with my users database and such
[10:27:50] <ep0ch> and make it all jquery prettiful
[10:29:51] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to find the next matching sibling based on a class selector, but it's ok to skip over some non-matching siblings?
[10:30:41] <fsd> ep0ch: well, i would suggest trying from scratch..nobody will ever make exactly what you want.. but maybe this is a starting point: youtube.com/watch?v=b8QTCO4W4vU
[10:32:31] <ep0ch> fsd, hard to believe there isn't some forum skeleton somewhere...
[10:32:46] <ep0ch> mjeh thanks anyhows
[10:33:19] <fsd> tomasm: $(this).next('.classname'); ?
[10:39:57] <arungpt> hey guys, after an ajax success callback i want to redirect the user to a new page, any suggestions on how to do that?
[10:41:18] <fsd> arungpt: window.location.href('/whatever/');
[10:41:56] <arungpt> fsd: thanks! any suggestion if i want to open it in an iframe with the fancybox plugin?
[10:42:37] <fsd> I would check thedocumentation.. im sure itsfairly simple
[10:43:14] <arungpt> cool, thanks! the docs on window.?
[10:43:41] <fsd> no, sorry. the doc on fancybox
[10:44:00] <arungpt> oh well the call is just .fancybox()
[10:44:08] <fsd> in patricular the 4th one in "various examples"
[10:44:27] <arungpt> gotcha
[10:45:47] <Holism> Hi guys.  OT, I haven't done web stuff recently.  I just took a trip and would like to make a series of pages with photos and a travel log.  Any recommended framework?
[10:46:56] <kelye> hello
[10:47:05] <kelye> if i have an element with data-id='smth'
[10:47:16] <kelye> what's the selector for that ?
[10:47:53] <fsd> kelye: .data('smith')
[10:48:07] <fsd> sorry
[10:48:27] <kelye> i guess that's how i get the value
[10:48:39] <fsd> yeah that waswron,one sec
[10:49:03] <kelye> but i want to do somethingl ike $('element[data=smth]'
[10:49:09] <kelye> in fact.. will that work ?:))
[10:49:52] <fsd> you'd need a find("data-id='smith'")
[10:50:06] <sunbeam> The effect of an image scroller like this here: http://www.geenstijl.nl/#a3029811 - how can i best achieve this? does anyone know a good plugin for it?
[10:50:25] <fsd> in brackets..sorry mynew keyboard is terrible
[10:50:38] <sunbeam> eh sorry this one www.geenstijl.nl/#a3030301
[10:50:45] <sunbeam> this slider
[10:51:41] <fsd> okay, better machine now.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4191386/jquery-how-to-find-an-element-based-on-a-data-attribute-value
[10:51:47] <fsd> try that
[10:56:38] <zackattack> would someone please inform me whether this is the proper way to dynamically insert scripts?  http://jsfiddle.net/ED6PZ/1/
[11:03:25] <arungpt> fsd: so im successfully redirecting to a new page but after a lot of googling i cant figure out how to make the new page open with fancybox
[11:07:23] <Posterdati> I'm using jquery dialog, when I try to drag a simple dialog it goes out of the page om top, the same code works on chrome!
[11:07:47] <Hippie_> can I slide up to a specific height?
[11:08:56] <johnkpaul> ?animate @Hippie_
[11:08:57] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[11:09:34] <lilred> Is anyone here familiar with the jQuery UI code base?
[11:10:11] <ezakimak> how do I invoke a method on a wijcalendar? $('#el_id').wijcalendar(...) .... $('#el_id').???.method()
[11:11:09] <ezakimak> trying to get it to prepopulate from selectedDates parameter
[11:11:34] <ezakimak> i think I might just need to call refresh()
[11:13:41] <Goopyo> is there a reason .show().clone() reverts display to original (in my case inline-block) while cone().show() reverts it to 'block' . Seems like a bug
[11:16:26] <SegFaultAX> A selector like $('#foo #bar') is redundant since $('#bar') returns the same thing, correct?
[11:16:44] <SegFaultAX> (Assuming the document is well-formed with unique ids)
[11:17:06] <tw2113> wouldn't that return the #bar dom element which would be a child of #foo?
[11:17:19] <outsmartin> both should be the same
[11:17:29] <Goopyo> right and if its unique its the same as just #bar
[11:17:32] <SegFaultAX> Yes, but if there is only one #bar on the page, then they both select the same element.
[11:17:33] <Goopyo> so yeah they are the same
[11:17:50] <SegFaultAX> And technically, the page is malformed if there are duplicate ids
[11:23:48] <Goopyo> Heres a duplication of the "bug"
[11:23:50] <Goopyo> http://jsfiddle.net/bsnxp/
[11:31:04] <deitarion> I'm having trouble determining whether jQuery has an equivalent to the Javascript 1.8.5 function.bind() call. (Shorthand for creating a closure which sets "this" and, optionally, an initial set of arguments.) Does anyone have any suggestions?
[11:31:20] <systemfault> deitarion, take a look at .proxy
[11:31:27] <systemfault> (Shitty name.. I know)
[11:33:56] <outsmartin> i have a strange problem with an indexOf
[11:34:08] <outsmartin> [6266,6234].indexOf(6234) returns 1 as expected
[11:34:26] <outsmartin> but the same thing doesnt work in my code
[11:34:39] <outsmartin> console.log JSON.parse(localStorage.merkliste).indexOf(id)
[11:34:40] <deitarion> Thanks. Also, are there any other functions like has() which select based on the properties of related DOM nodes? (eg. an equivalent to has() that could be used to filter an existing list of nodes for those with a PARENT that matches the given selector)
[11:34:48] <outsmartin> with exact same content
[11:35:08] <outsmartin> always returning a -1 to me
[11:38:53] <TheSisb> Can I get some critique on my first jQuery plugin please :) http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU
[11:39:39] <ENQ> i need to test jqueyr plugin, any tips, or test framework to use?
[11:40:50] <ENQ> i found it, thanks
[11:41:06] <deitarion> ENQ: Found what? QUnit?
[11:41:13] <ENQ> yes
[11:45:07] <srj55> is it possible to get base64 data (or any format really) of an <img> that is loaded in your html page?  I want to be able to use JSZip to zip up all the images currently loaded on the page (http://dduponchel.github.com/jszip/)
[11:45:25] <Hippie_> Why doesnt height = 'auto' work in a animate function?
[11:46:36] <deitarion> srj55: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/934012/get-image-data-in-javascript
[11:47:56] <srj55> deitarion: yep, i tried that...couldn't get it to work.     tried  the getBase64Image(img)....  where my img=document.getElementById("my_img_id")...maybe only works for firefox?
[11:48:37] <d3f4ultr0> hey fsd, it worked.
[11:49:19] <deitarion> srj55: In that case, probably better to ask on a site like SO or maybe in a general Javascript channel. jQuery doesn't really have any special relationship with the API exposed by <img> tags.
[11:49:33] <srj55> deitarion: yeah, good idea.
[11:51:12] <deitarion> srj55: I can suggest one thing to try though. Poke your way through the example getBase64Image statement-by-statement so you can figure out which part is failing.
[11:54:33] <srj55> deitarion: i'm getting a typeError on the line   ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);     i'm passing in img=$('#my_image_id')...maybe that's not the right format for img?
[11:54:57] <deitarion> It isn't. You need the raw DOM object but you're passing in the jQuery wrapper.
[11:55:00] <deitarion> One sec.
[11:55:32] <deitarion> (You can use document.getElementById('my_image_id') but I'm going to look up how to extract individual elements from a jQuery wrapper you already have... just for completeness.)
[11:56:02] <deitarion> srj55: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:56:40] <deitarion> To use jQuery, rather than getElementById, you'd use img=$('#my_image_id').get(0)
[11:57:03] <danzik17> deitarion: or just $('#my_image_id')[0]
[11:58:02] <deitarion> danzik17: Ahh. I never knew you could use jQuery that way. How long as that been around?
[11:58:18] <arungpt> does anyone know how to use window.location.href to open the URL in an iframe/fancybox?
[11:58:33] <danzik17> deitarion: since...it was released =P
[11:59:05] <deitarion> danzik17: Ahh, then I was bitten by my preference to rush toward practical applications and fill in my knowledge from the API docs later.
[12:00:25] <srj55> deitarion:  ok, yep, it works...but i'm getting a Security DOM exception 18...i imagine because the image src is not from the same domain.
[12:01:01] <deitarion> srj55: Probably. The Firefox guys did temporarily disable their WebGL cross-origin texture support to prevent that sort of access from leaking data.
[12:01:55] <deitarion> srj55: Where are you trying to load the image from? If it's somewhere like Flickr, then you should be able to use a cross-origin XMLHttpRequest to load the image data directly and then drop it into the <img> tag if need be.
[12:02:16] <deitarion> (As I understand it, Flickr implements the necessary CORS headers to authorize such requests)
[12:03:10] <srj55> deitarion: could be any image storage like twitpic, instagram, etc...
[12:03:36] <deitarion> srj55: Is this for a Greasemonkey script?
[12:04:20] <deitarion> (If so, retrieve the URL from the img tag and use Greasemonkey's internal privilieged XMLHttpRequest call. If not, you'll probably have to do it server-side.)
[12:04:31] <srj55> deitarion: no.  a user will have a whole bunch of images on a page.  i want to provide a client-side option to save all these images into a zip which they can also download.  all client side.
[12:05:13] <deitarion> Hmm. I'm not sure that's possible without the CORS OK from the sites hosting the images.
[12:06:45] <deitarion> The web is quite an impressive example of pushing the boundaries of what kind of cross-site integration can be done without compromising sandboxing.
[12:07:09] <srj55> deitarion: how can i check is CORS OK is coming from a particular image hosting domain?
[12:08:10] <deitarion> srj55: Use whatever approach you prefer to verify that, when your browser sends an "Origin: ..." header in the request, the response contains a favorable set of "Access-Control-Allow-*: ..." headers.
[12:09:02] <ezio> what's the best way to darken a div and overlay a loading icon?
[12:09:04] <deitarion> srj55: The most basic "permission granted" responses are either "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" or "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <The URL from the Origin header in the request>"
[12:10:19] <deitarion> srj55: Also keep the support limitations in mind: http://caniuse.com/cors
[12:11:16] <deitarion> srj55: You'll need to test for the XDomainRequest object and use it instead of XMLHttpRequest to support IE8 and IE9. IE6 and IE7, and Opera versions prior to today's 12.0 release don't support it at all.
[12:11:42] <srj55> deitarion: yeah, all good info.   i don't think ill be able to use the .toDataURL() function for the img's that I need.  Looks like canvas elements have a origin-clean flag, which is set when external images are written to the canvas
[12:12:53] <deitarion> srj55: That's why you use XMLHttpRequest or XDomainRequest with CORS. By letting CORS OK the request, you should be transitioning the data's ownership to the current origin.
[12:13:58] <srj55> deitarion: so, would that be jQuery.ajax() for the jquery equivalent?
[12:14:39] <deitarion> srj55: You'll need a jQuery plugin to handle detecting and using XDomainRequest if you want to support IE versions prior to the upcoming 10.0 release.
[12:15:02] <ezio> is there a plugin to darken a div and show a loading icon?
[12:15:50] <srj55> deitarion: i'll just support FF, Chrome, ...    do i need any special flags set for the ajax() call?
[12:16:17] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/efA09Cm7
[12:16:28] <vacho> ajpiano: please if you have a moment I can borrow your brain..take a look at that paste bin
[12:16:32] <deitarion> srj55: Nope. CORS is completely transparent in fully supported browsers. I actually have a StackOverflow answer with over 100 upvotes because of that.
[12:17:22] <deitarion> (Someone thought they were doing JSONP when they weren't but it still worked sometimes because one of the two sites they were connecting to (Flickr) was set up to do the CORS OK)
[12:18:04] <srj55> deitarion: cool.  so i do an ajax request for the img.  but then what do i do? at this point, can i  get access to the img data itself?
[12:18:52] <deitarion> srj55: XMLHttpRequest lets you load raw file contents. You can then just pick a filename and feed them to your Javascript Zip library for processing.
[12:24:22] <macmartine> I'm using the jQuery form plugin ( http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#api ) to detect when any form submit completes. This is how it's done https://gist.github.com/2932356 but is there a way I can bind that so that when a portion of a page is updated, this attaches to any newly rendered forms?

[12:42:24] <aborady> u see the image dont affected by zoom
[12:42:30] <aborady> how is that
[12:42:42] <aborady> i inspect elements i see its normal img tag
[12:42:47] <aborady> can anybody explain
[12:42:47] <aborady> ?
[12:43:12] <kollapse> aborady: You should check the source code more often

[12:48:13] <aborady> i need this technique really
[12:48:42] <innociv> Where do you patent software at, without using an expensive lawyer?
[12:51:20] <chilversc> innociv: you use a cheap lawyer instead
[12:51:51] <innociv> How do you make sure the lawyer isn't stealing the patent anyway? I'm paranoid.
[12:57:30] <Holism> innociv - NDA
[12:57:45] <innociv> Alright
[12:59:54] <aborady> can anybody help me with that ppl ?
[13:00:01] <aborady> i really need help
[13:01:44] <[fields]> aborady: I just walked in.  wow there's 899+ users in here, why is everyone so silent?  I missed seeing your problem, or else I would try to help.
[13:04:55] <xsamurai> Im not getting the expected results here http://jsfiddle.net/7Yp8M/ when using $(this).children, without it , it works fine
[13:06:39] <innociv> So something like legalzoom doesn't work here?
[13:09:10] <CristiMihai> xsamurai: can you post your html as well in your jsfiddle? Sorry, I wasn't in from the beginning. Anyway, I have a strong feeling you want to use $(this).siblings(".error-div") …..
[13:09:51] <CristiMihai> xsamurai: is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/7Yp8M/
[13:11:01] <xsamurai> CristiMihai: yeah that was my original paste
[13:11:39] <xsamurai> it looks fine but i get no errors in firebug and it doesnt work as expected heres with the html as well http://jsfiddle.net/7Yp8M/2/
[13:12:02] <CristiMihai> Sorry, I meant to give you this: http://jsfiddle.net/7Yp8M/1/
[13:12:17] <CristiMihai> Let me have a look on your 2nd one
[13:13:48] <xsamurai> http://jsfiddle.net/7Yp8M/2/
[13:14:16] <aborady> plz checkout that http://thegreatdiscontent.com/kate-bingaman-burt
[13:14:34] <aborady> and tell me how when you zoom in or out all contents affected but images
[13:14:37] <aborady> how is that ?
[13:18:38] <macmartine> Any idea why having this 'success' callback would cause the form to be submitted twice? https://gist.github.com/2932688
[13:20:05] <CristiMihai> xsamurai: Here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/7Yp8M/3/ … basically, in your case $(this) was at the input level, but you want to go up the DOM to your row, and then look for your .error-div. Have a look at http://api.jquery.com/closest/ to see what that does… (just so I don't say .parent().parent() )
[13:20:52] <o-O-o> hello, I am facing a strange bug on IE 9 (heh heh) window.open - it returns null sometimes, even when the desired window is actually opened
[13:21:01] <o-O-o> does jquery has something to open windows?
[13:21:14] <o-O-o> (and return a valid window handle, ofc)

[13:24:11] <yosmanyga> Hi guys
[13:24:26] <yosmanyga> Do you know a good plugin to fill a form with ajax?
[13:25:43] <jedimind> fill it how
[13:25:45] <jedimind> ajax what
[13:27:50] <yosmanyga> fill a form from from ajax request
[13:28:06] <NoiseEee> yosmanyga: yeah you do that yourself.
[13:28:24] <yosmanyga> yes, i know, but maybe you know a library
[13:28:24] <NoiseEee> yosmanyga: $('#fieldID').val(valueFromXHRResponse)
[13:28:33] <NoiseEee> yosmanyga: what kind of library could assist you in that?
[13:28:48] <yosmanyga> I'm looking at https://github.com/makotovh/formFill
[13:29:14] <yosmanyga> Also I'm looking at http://www.keyframesandcode.com/resources/javascript/jQuery/demos/populate-demo.html
[13:29:25] <NoiseEee> yosmanyga: in the time it takes you to search for any half-assed plugin like above, and vet them, you could write your own very simple script for that very simple task
[13:29:40] <yosmanyga> But I just want to know if there is a "popular" library
[13:30:01] <NoiseEee> yosmanyga: no, that sort of thing is pretty basic and there is generally no need for any library to achieve your goals
[13:30:04] <yosmanyga> Yes, you are right, but i dont like to reinvent wheels
[13:30:39] <yosmanyga> Look this: https://github.com/malsup/form
[13:30:49] <yosmanyga> It's a library to submit a form using ajax
[13:31:16] <NoiseEee> incredible
[13:31:43] <yosmanyga> It's very easy to make this by hand, but better if using a library
[13:32:07] <yosmanyga> maintained by community (167 folks)
[13:32:31] <yosmanyga> So, I'm looking for a good library to fill form fields, if exists
[13:35:39] <Goopyo> how do you access the # in the heading?
[13:36:15] <o-O-o> does jquery has something to open windows on IE 9? :D
[13:36:37] <MeXTuX> I have a text input element and want to fill it clicking on it, showing a popup with a combo. After selecting an option the input must have the combobox selected value. Is it possible? Does anybody have a working example?
[13:37:36] <Goopyo> MeXTuX:
[13:38:11] <Goopyo> whats a combobox?
[13:39:02] <MeXTuX> Goopyo: I meant select element
[13:39:50] <Goopyo> oh then just ('#select_id').change(function(){ ('#input_id'}.val(($this).val()) )
[13:39:58] <Goopyo> MeXTuX: ^
[13:41:33] <MeXTuX> Can I hide select element and show it only when I click on input element?
[13:42:28] <joshmock> MeXTuX: $("#myinput").bind("click", function () { $("#select_id").show(); }
[13:42:48] <joshmock> );
[13:43:11] <joshmock> actually
[13:43:46] <joshmock> $("#myinput").bind("focusin", function () { $("#select_id").show(); });
[13:45:15] <MeXTuX> That's a very good start :D Thank you
[13:45:19] <joshmock> no problem!

[14:05:09] <vacho> anyone? ajpiano ?
[14:05:43] <shoky> vacho: what fails
[14:06:32] <shoky> laszlof: did you find it :)
[14:07:03] <laszlof> no :(
[14:07:04] <shoky> laszlof in case you didnt..  ()   :P
[14:07:07] <shoky> missing  ()
[14:07:08] <shoky> :)
[14:07:21] <laszlof> where?
[14:07:42] <shoky> you want to execute that anonymous function
[14:07:46] <shoky> at the end
[14:08:00] <laszlof> oh, right
[14:08:05] <laszlof> i didnt copy that from my original script
[14:08:06] <vacho> when I have this in the data field: data: {type: $(this).parent().attr('data-type'), asset_status_id: 'y'  } it only passes the y... not the type
[14:08:30] <laszlof> well shit
[14:08:33] <laszlof> it works in jsfiddle
[14:08:38] <shoky> vacho: what is $(this).parent().attr('data-type')  ?
[14:08:39] <laszlof> why the hell doesnt it work in my app
[14:08:59] <laszlof> its literally identical to at least a dozen other button functions
[14:09:44] <shoky> DOM ready ?
[14:09:52] <NoiseEee> vacho: then $(this).parent().attr('data-type') is null
[14:10:10] <laszlof> ah, fixed
[14:10:13] <laszlof> changed it to .live
[14:10:31] <laszlof> the button is being dynamically generated after the app loads. so .bind wasnt working
[14:11:02] <vacho> NoiseEee: shouldn't it then at least pass a null in the get ?
[14:11:27] <NoiseEee> vacho: no, jquery will toss/get rid of it in the actual xhr request
[14:11:45] <vacho> ok, take a look at my complete function, I think my "this" might be confused
[14:11:46] <NoiseEee> meaning it won't even bother sending the 'key' if the value is null
[14:11:48] <shoky> vacho:  put   data: {type: console.log($(this).parent().attr('data-type')), asset_status_id: 'y'  }
[14:11:56] <shoky> and check your console
[14:12:14] <shoky> most likely your 'this' is indeed confused
[14:12:16] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/R5yuWDQy
[14:12:41] <vacho> take a look there at line 26
[14:13:02] <shoky> do what i said
[14:13:03] <shoky> check your console
[14:13:38] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/156eEY9g
[14:13:57] <vacho> shoky: ok
[14:15:30] <vacho> shoky: i did what you said, console log did not even throw anything.
[14:15:54] <shoky> and the ajax request was sent..?
[14:16:41] <shoky> nothing in console? not even 'undefined'  or 'null' or smth?
[14:17:17] <vacho> no
[14:17:21] <vacho> wierd but no
[14:17:22] <vacho> nothing
[14:17:36] <shoky> and it was sent?
[14:17:46] <vacho> yes, shows up in the net tab
[14:18:07] <shoky> anyway
[14:18:16] <shoky> make sure that 'this' points to what you think it points to
[14:18:25] <shoky> or dont use 'this'
[14:18:33] <vacho> it did throw undefined!! but only once? I try the call multiple times but it throws it only once.
[14:18:43] <vacho> what should I use instead of this? I have multiple of same element
[14:19:06] <shoky> i dont know what element you want to refer to dude
[14:19:20] <shoky> what do you think 'this' points to?
[14:19:52] <vacho> im afraid it points to the form ?
[14:19:56] <shoky> console.log(this) before the  $('.last-modified-tooltip').qtip({   line
[14:20:31] <vacho> shoky: before it will be the form for sure.. I was hoping this would not be the form inside qtip ?
[14:21:04] <shoky> you're not "inside" the qtip
[14:21:19] <shoky> you're just passing an object literal to  .qtip(...)
[14:21:38] <shoky> so 'this' wont change
[14:21:41] <vacho> shoky: do you know any solution?
[14:21:49] <vacho> shoky: ok thanks for clearing that up, that explains why it does not work!
[14:22:24] <shoky> maybe you want:  data: {type: $('.last-modified-tooltip').parent().attr('data-type'), asset_status_id: 'y'  }
[14:22:26] <shoky> i dont know.
[14:22:51] <Illusioneer> /j #node.js
[14:24:42] <vacho> shoky: that will not work :( i don't think jquery will know which one to use.. I have 100 of the class .last-modified-tooltip
[14:28:02] <vacho> i wish ajpiano was heree :(
[14:28:25] <shoky> vacho
[14:28:32] <shoky> patience..
[14:28:33] <deitarion> What's the most concise, elegant way to select a sibling of a selector-specified ancestor of the current jQuery object?
[14:28:49] <deitarion> I'm trying to make this more elegant --> $(this).closest('tr').next().is(o.details_outer)
[14:28:52] <vacho> shoky: ok ok .. I hope it's resolvable
[14:30:18] <shoky> vacho: http://pastebin.com/SA04cPCp
[14:31:47] <shoky> deitarion: $(this).closest('tr').next(o.details_outer)  ?
[14:32:40] <deitarion> shoky: It's used for testing whether a given row has an open details expander on http://gbindex.ssokolow.com/stories/17
[14:33:24] <vacho> shoky: thanks, it threw an error on } ... trying to figure out the right way of closing the brackets.
[14:34:17] <shoky> vacho: http://pastebin.com/LudtT1j9
[14:35:45] <deitarion> shoky: Well, it is in the development version that's part-way to being split out into an alternative to jQuery-Accordion-Table that's more friendly to progressive enhancement.
[14:36:18] <vacho> shoky: that's friggin awesome..how the f did u do that??
[14:36:27] <vacho> shoky: I got to study your code thank you so much!
[14:36:36] <shoky> vacho: its jquery ;p
[14:37:10] <k1ng_> !up k1ngdom.net
[14:39:37] <shoky> deitarion: sorry donno what you're talking about, but if you want a sibling of a selector-specified ancestor of 'this' element... then it doesn't get any more concise/elegant than $(this).closest('tr').next()
[14:40:07] <Nasrudin> Hi, I seem to have a problem with my keypress in Firefox
[14:40:11] <Nasrudin> it always returns a 0
[14:40:17] <Nasrudin> whereas in chrome, it returns the right number
[14:40:27] <shoky> returns?
[14:40:59] <Nasrudin> err, I mean gives the wrong number to e.which
[14:41:10] <Nasrudin> always gives 0, that is.
[14:42:15] <shoky> works fine for me
[14:43:43] <sunbeam> in IE7, when i have a slider, and below that a submenu (initiated when hovering over) is displaying, in IE7 there is no way to have the submenu appear above the slider image.. any idea how i can fix this? I tried z-index already
[14:44:49] <deitarion> shoky: Drat. Another limitation of CSS's progression from parent to child, I suppose. Here's hoping they at least finally implement that proposal from nearly a decade ago that would allow a native implementation of jQuery's has() via a syntax along these lines -->  "$selected additional.filter"
[14:45:28] <Nasrudin> Heh, guess which smart guy messed up e.which and e.keycode
[14:46:07] <_helpPlz_> raw xml api dump at api.jquery.com doesn't return xml?
[14:47:47] <shoky> _helpPlz_: sure it does..
[14:48:08] <shoky> <?xml version="1.0" ?><api>
[14:48:39] <_helpPlz_> omg opera zzz
[14:48:56] <shoky> its not opera
[14:49:04] <shoky> i mean its not just opera..
[14:53:07] <shoky> deitarion: it's not CSS' fault that you choose to have your code make decisions based on your view's elements, instead of on your actual data
[14:53:52] <deitarion> shoky: But it is the browser's fault that binding to click events on <tr> elements is buggy and inconsistent.
[15:03:40] <shoky> maybe ;p
[15:03:58] <alcuadrado> does anyone experienced problems with firefox not styling elements fast enough?
[15:05:51] <alcuadrado> I have a script with adds some elements, and acording to their widths does something. That works fine in chrome, but in firefox i get a wrong width, but if I pute a timeoute to check the width, I get the correct one :s
[15:19:15] <sunbeam> in IE7, when i have a slider, and below that a submenu (initiated when hovering over) is displaying, in IE7 there is no way to have the submenu appear above the slider image.. any idea how i can fix this? I tried z-index already
[15:19:47] <shoky> sunbeam, a better solution to your problem would be to do something like this:  http://imgur.com/a/vXo5A
[15:21:15] <sunbeam> would love that :)
[15:21:25] <sunbeam> but don't think this employer would accept that
[15:21:26] <NaN> is there any method to know if a json node is an array or an object?
[15:22:15] <shoky> NaN: $.type(node)
[15:22:31] <NaN> thanks shoky :)
[15:23:31] <shoky> sunbeam: then strike!
[15:23:37] <shoky> IE7 strike
[15:23:55] <sunbeam> well seriously, how professional is it to leave ie7 out of the picture?
[15:24:10] <sunbeam> or better, how realistic
[15:24:12] <shoky> very professional, if you ask me ;)
[15:27:36] <sunbeam> well damn there should be a fix for my issue
[15:27:40] <sunbeam> i think i have had this before
[15:29:01] <Bankzilla> shocky: (Y)
[15:29:01] <NaN> how can I obtain the field name on an object? { fieldx : value } < get the fieldX string and get the value string
[15:29:27] <alcuadrado> is it the only field NaN ?
[15:30:02] <NaN> alcuadrado: there are some more, but if I know how to get the first I can make an iterator for the rest
[15:30:27] <Bankzilla> NaN: You can use a for loop to get each key => value
[15:30:30] <alcuadrado> but you can iterate them :s
[15:31:18] <alcuadrado> for (filedName in object) alert(object[fieldName]);
[15:31:51] <NaN> but I don't know the fieldName :(
[15:32:03] <NaN> the data comes from a json
[15:32:17] <alcuadrado> test that
[15:32:31] <NaN> and I want to make some kind of json to html converter
[15:32:37] <alcuadrado> it iterates over all the fileds, setting in the variable fieldName the name of each one
[15:33:11] <alcuadrado> btw, I recommend you to read more about the javascript basis
[15:33:12] <NaN> that way I need to alter the json an give a "fieldName" at first
[15:33:25] <NaN> hehe true I'm a n00b
[15:35:09] <Bankzilla> the example alcuadrado provided is how you loop through and access the value of each item in the object
[15:36:58] <Bankzilla> can test with, for(var i in jsonObject){console.log('key: ',i, ' value: ',jsonObject[i])};
[15:39:17] <NaN> get it!
[15:39:21] <NaN> thanks guys :D
[15:39:50] <talntid> is it appropriate to post a paying job opportunuty here?
[15:43:34] <hwk> does $('#eleid') returns the same object as getElementById() ?
[15:44:45] <shoky> hwk: $('#eleid') returns a jquery object (which wraps the DOM element selected by getElementById )
[15:45:21] <shoky> hwk: $('#eleid')[0] === document.getElementById('eleid')
[15:45:22] <hwk> i think [0
[15:45:33] <hwk> yep. console.log showed me the way
[15:45:39] <shoky> ;p
[15:46:08] <hwk> this way i can use class selectors also and pass the to older js functions
[16:06:10] <jsnoob> if i do var poops = $("<div>poop</div>") can i get that html back out from poops
[16:06:38] <shoky> jsnoob: poops.html()
[16:06:47] <shoky> oh you mean including the <div> ?
[16:07:47] <jsnoob> shoky: yes including the div
[16:07:57] <jsnoob> .html() will only return "poop"
[16:08:27] <shoky> i'd just use  poops[0].outerHTML
[16:11:24] <jsnoob> shoky: that looks perfect. ty
[16:13:09] <dabaR> I'm trying to set up a javascript-driven login form that redirects to another domain (subdomain) and sets up the URL to do basic http auth. Doesn't seem to work well in any browser, and IE doesn't like the window.location.href to a different domain

[16:29:33] <gdoron> Hello, what is the best way to get an official answer from a jQuery developer for an issue which isn't a bug (performance).
[16:30:30] <finga> i have a question about jquery beginner scripting, is here the right place to ask?
[16:33:05] <gdoron> Hello, what is the best way to get an official answer from a jQuery developer for an issue which isn't a bug (performance).
[16:34:13] <deitarion> gdoron: Don't repeat yourself so quickly. If those of us who are actually sitting at the computer don't know, we don't know.
[16:36:05] <gdoron> um.... sorry
[16:36:13] <shoky> gdoron: the best way is to ask here
[16:36:48] <gdoron> I asked he twice, but I didn't get the answer I was hoping to get. :(
[16:37:04] <shoky> what q
[16:37:51] <gdoron> How is it that parents is a lot faster than closest.
[16:37:55] <Bankzilla> gdoron: can join #jquery-dev
[16:38:56] <gdoron> Thanks for the tip
[16:44:43] <acidjazz> so before i write an xmlhttp post from scratch instead of .get or .post is there any way w/ jquery to intercept .onprogress?
[17:06:14] <someprimetime> if I have a link like <a id="click-me" class="js-show-modal" data-show="hidden-div"></a> and then a hidden div like <div id="hidden-div">foobar stuff here </div> how can i trigger the click on the link?
[17:06:30] <someprimetime> it keeps freezing in safari when i do $('#click-me').trigger('click');
[17:11:14] <RobW> I have an attached "position:absolute" div on another div that's expanding.. for some reason, the DOM doesn't update the attached div until animations are complete. Can anyone take a look? http://tinyurl.com/cjeyr32
[17:12:23] <RobW> If you click Open - you'll notice the semi-circle disappears until animation is complete, and vice-versa.. any ideas?
[17:19:12] <jyg> so for soralla's jcarousel you have to define all of the movement of the carousel within the skin?
[17:19:40] <jyg> it seems you must use a version of one of his skin style sheets
[17:34:47] <jyg> wow i've tried over 20 jquery-based carousels now, all garbage
[17:35:01] <jyg> 1/2 of them cannot handle complicated data within carousel items
[17:35:45] <jyg> the other 1/2 have have no way of telling whether or not they've already been rendered and go berzerk is bootstrap.js attempts to re run any code
[17:36:01] <jyg> s/is/if/
[17:36:32] <jyg> any recommendations for a carousel that his that hard combination of  simple+nosuck
[17:36:33] <jyg> ?
[17:38:37] <Whirl3d> write your own with jquery.cycle
[17:40:45] <johnline> galleria?
[18:05:46] <Whirl3d> what is the correct syntax for .proxy
[18:05:56] <Ernston> anyone here used a facebook social plugin for a site?
[18:05:59] <Ernston> on a site*
[18:07:53] <shoky> Whirl3d: $.proxy( fn, context )
[18:08:26] <shoky> Whirl3d: or  $.proxy( context, functionNameInContext )
[18:09:31] <cluelesscoder> someone up for reviewing my newb code at http://www.badcapitalist.com/test.html? I'm trying to load a select with options from my database - two functions look identical to me but one works and the other doesn't - loadCountryOptions() and loadSectorOptions()
[18:10:01] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I guess I am not sure which to use. I am binding custom events to an element such that when the event is fired for the element, it really calls an objects method of the same name...
[18:10:07] <LordJesusChrist> Stand back.
[18:10:35] <shoky> whichever is more suitable for you i guess
[18:10:41] <Whirl3d> so $(element).bind({announce:$.proxy(obj, "announce"), subscribe:$.proxy(obj,"subscribe")});
[18:11:01] <shoky> what is obj?
[18:11:16] <Whirl3d> then $(element).trigger("announce', data) will actually call obj.announce(data) ...right?
[18:11:27] <Ernston> anyone used addthis sharing plugin?
[18:11:42] <Whirl3d> my publisher object...but that'll make sense in a couple minutes
[18:11:45] <shoky> Whirl3d yeah i think so
[18:12:16] <Whirl3d> Cool As Hell. I think I have come up with a great way to handle my pub sub issues...I have to run an errand, but I'll post it when I get back.

[18:40:21] <donkeycongo> Best dynamic-textarea plugin? I have tried .elastic() and .autosize(). Both mess up.
[18:48:04] <Ernston> does anyone know another way i can achieve this: http://www.ndoherty.biz/demos/coda-slider/2.0/
[18:48:46] <Ernston> this example is from 2009, am not sure what am looking for exactl, a news ticker with thumbnails to slide through the headlines
[18:52:30] <deitarion> What's the proper way to check if two single-node jQuery wrappers are wrapping the same DOM node?
[18:53:05] <deitarion> ($tr.next() and $details)
[18:53:38] <donkeycongo> deitarion: Have you tried .has()
[18:53:44] <danzik17> deitarion: if you're sure they're always single node, you can just do collection1[0] === collection2[0]
[19:00:06] <saintvinasse> Hi there
[19:00:35] <deitarion> donkeycongo: I hadn't thought of that. One sec.
[19:01:20] <deitarion> danzik17: One's $(this).closest('tr') but I forget what the other is.
[19:02:13] <saintvinasse> I was wondering if it's possible to select any <strong> in a page, and wrap a <strong> around every words contained in that <strong> (and remove the original <strong> to avoid having a strong wrapping other strongs
[19:02:18] <deitarion> donkeycongo: I used .is() instead, but it seems to work.
[19:02:35] <acidjazz> so before i write an xmlhttp post from scratch instead of .get or .post is there any way w/ jquery to intercept .onprogress?
[19:02:40] <acidjazz> sorry i asked before but i had to bail
[19:07:04] <Ernston> can anyone tell me what am searching for?
[19:07:08] <Ernston> if i explained
[19:12:29] <m1chael> i'm working on a concept for a browser/server-side video editor.. ive never actually done any video editing before in my life with any program, so im kind of taking a stab in the dark... can anyone take a look at what i've created so far and let me know what you think? (if it would work, if there is something better out there, etc.)
[19:12:36] <m1chael> http://www.vipautographs.com/static/test/
[19:20:50] <acidjazz> ok from googling it seems like i can hook up to onprogress via jquerys .get and .post
[19:20:53] <acidjazz> can any1 tell me how
[19:22:00] <rjgoncalvess> hey
[19:24:22] <Ernston> this place that hard to get an answer ?
[19:27:45] <Whirl3d> danzik17, I am almost ready to try out my new pubsub event based on your suggest of $.Callbacks()...
[19:54:13] <o]> how can I 'clone' or 'copy' a DOM node?
[19:54:22] <o]> is it possible?
[19:55:26] <systemfault> o]: Yeah..
[19:55:34] <systemfault> With jQuery, it's .clone() :P
[19:56:03] <o]> what about the ids?
[19:56:06] <o]> will they repeat? :(
[19:56:16] <systemfault> o]: Remove it from the clone
[19:56:44] <o]> $(blah).clone().attr("id","").appendTo(dest) ?
[19:57:10] <systemfault> .removeAttr('id')
[19:57:42] <o]> :D thanks
[19:58:06] <Whirl3d> Doh! why can't I instantiate a single $.Callbacs() object? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rSjJq/3/
[19:58:39] <systemfault> o]: There's not enough *** in jQuery :(
[19:59:13] <o]> yeah! few languages allow three star coders
[20:00:58] <o]> another question about selecting elements
[20:01:22] <o]> how can I apply a selector upon only the child nodes (all levels) of an element?
[20:02:07] <systemfault> myRoflLolNode.find('*')
[20:02:43] <o]> :~)
[20:06:07] <Brodingo> no
[20:06:11] <Brodingo> dont use *
[20:06:17] <Brodingo> .children()
[20:06:27] <Brodingo> oh
[20:06:31] <systemfault> He sais all levels..
[20:06:33] <systemfault> *said

[20:08:45] <Brodingo> well better advice would be to reconsider what youre doing if you have to use *
[20:08:57] <systemfault> I agree.
[20:13:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/wx6Lc/22/
[20:14:31] <Whirl3d> ^ can someone help me figure out why I am losing reference to my object in the "subscribe" part of this script
[20:17:52] <systemfault> Whirl3d: You're losing the objects on the last two lines I guess
[20:18:21] <systemfault> You're passing a function without object...
[20:18:39] <systemfault> The weird thing is that you actually used proxy at another place in the code..
[20:18:51] <merlin1978> Help I get  this error      TypeError: $("#affiliate-dlg").dialog is not a function    this is how I declared my jDialog   http://pastie.org/4090060
[20:19:26] <systemfault> I would put ({ on the same line as dialog
[20:20:01] <systemfault> Forget k&r style with JS.. it's going to bite you often.
[20:20:01] <merlin1978> ?
[20:20:24] <systemfault> Merge line 8 and 9
[20:21:18] <systemfault> If it's not that, write a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[20:22:17] <rodd> I hate trying to be perfectionist with my code
[20:22:26] <rodd> I end up in such paranoia
[20:22:38] <merlin1978> systemfault: I get the same error
[20:22:55] <Ernston> does anyone know what is depreciated in jquery-ui-1.8.19.custom.min.js   that causes autocomplete to break
[20:22:57] <systemfault> merlin1978: Write a testcase on jsfiddle.net :(
[20:23:19] <danzik17> Whirl3d: fwiw, with the way you're trying to write your "Publisher" class, most to all of the functions that are instance methods should really be prototype methods imo.  that's not to say instance methods won't work though, because they will.
[20:23:20] <merlin1978> systemfault: this code worked in another page
[20:23:32] <systemfault> :(
[20:23:51] <merlin1978> systemfault: actually when I run the page I do not see any erro
[20:23:54] <merlin1978> error
[20:24:01] <merlin1978> in firebug
[20:24:14] <systemfault> merlin1978: You said you had type errors
[20:24:31] <merlin1978> but is I try to run this in firebug console that is where I got the error
[20:24:38] <Whirl3d> cool. Why prototype and not instance. I have never been told what the difference is in terms of how things are built.
[20:24:51] <systemfault> merlin1978: Try wrapping the code in a .ready event
[20:24:55] <Whirl3d> I can change to prototype, just not sure why?
[20:25:07] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Lighter.
[20:25:20] <merlin1978> systemfault: I tried wrapping it with $(document).ready(function()
[20:25:24] <systemfault> Whirl3d: The prototype will contain functions that will be shared with all instances
[20:25:27] <merlin1978> but still the same problem
[20:25:33] <systemfault> merlin1978: Sad :/
[20:25:47] <Whirl3d> and that's not true with instance methods?
[20:25:57] <Whirl3d> oh. I am getting it now.
[20:26:18] <danzik17> Whirl3d: http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/
[20:26:27] <Whirl3d> well, it's fuzzy... but I'm close...lol
[20:26:34] <merlin1978> systemfault: This is the code http://pastie.org/4090079  it only shows hallo1
[20:27:29] <merlin1978> systemfault: I tried running  $('#btnViewAcnt').live('click', function (e)   it will say live is not a function
[20:27:32] <merlin1978> :(
[20:27:52] <systemfault> merlin1978: You're sure that jQuery is properly included?
[20:28:05] <systemfault> And before jquery ui
[20:28:31] <thomedy> what up everyone im back
[20:28:41] <thomedy> merlin you by anychanc arent merlin of chaos are you
[20:36:39] <Whirl3d> anybody smell burnt toast...or am I just about to stroke out? LOL rewriting my class to use prototypical inheritence in the hopes that I'll see the benefits en route. Thanks for the input danzik17, systemfault.
[20:36:54] <rodd> .done() = success() ?
[20:40:12] <systemfault> rodd: Yeah… .success is deprecated though
[20:40:27] <systemfault> the only 3 you should use are .done .fail .always
[20:41:39] <rodd> alright, thanks systemfault
[20:44:40] <andrewhl> Whirl3d: you must be Canadian
[20:45:18] <RobW> I have an attached "position:absolute" div after another div that's expanding.. for some reason, the DOM doesn't update the attached div until animations are complete. Can anyone take a look? http://tinyurl.com/cjeyr32
[20:45:28] <RobW> Click on the arrow.. notice how it disappears until animation is complete.
[21:00:47] <Whirl3d> andrewhl, why do you ask....i'm not Canadian, though...hmmmm
[21:01:03] <andrewhl> Burnt toast and strokes
[21:01:35] <Whirl3d> that's Canadian? Apparently just before you have a stroke, you get an overwhelming smell of burnt toast...
[21:01:44] <Whirl3d> are strokes common in Canada?
[21:02:25] <TheSisb> Just as common as they are in Nevada
[21:03:06] <andrewhl> No more than anywhere else, but I suspect you are likely channeling http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNdM9JhTPJw
[21:03:19] <rodd> your chances of having a stroke are 4x higher if you sleep less than 8hrs
[21:03:30] <rodd> i may have one soon
[21:05:07] <systemfault> o_O As a canadian.. I'm not proud of that weird commercial
[21:05:46] <andrewhl> But you can't deny it's sort of a national identifier at this point
[21:06:36] <thomedy> crap that is showin up everywhere i am getting something like 2 to 4  hors of sleep a night
[21:07:23] <rodd> 2?
[21:07:28] <rodd> crazy
[21:07:30] <thomedy> sometimes
[21:07:35] <rodd> I get 5 - 6
[21:07:37] <thomedy> i have 2 jobs one of which i just got off
[21:07:48] <rodd> same, 2 jobs
[21:08:01] <rodd> I must recharge my energy
[21:08:10] <thomedy> and i have to be up at 430 and for my other one... and i am working to build 2 business and raise 2 kids and build a marriage as best i can
[21:08:20] <rodd> base jump would do me good
[21:08:40] <systemfault> thomedy: How about focusing on a single business? :/
[21:08:44] <thomedy> right now i would love to be sleeping but sleeping doesn't make my life better it makes me work 2 god aweful jobs
[21:08:47] <andrewhl> thomedy: complain less, sleep more
[21:08:50] <thomedy> well one bossts the other
[21:09:04] <rodd> thomedy where r u from?
[21:09:06] <thomedy> im building an online store and learning web to build a dev business
[21:09:13] <thomedy> im from cali but im living in ia... ugh
[21:09:17] <Koganei> so it seems that doing .css() removes the :hover class from the css file :o
[21:09:22] <thomedy> im hoping to get in chicago as soon as possible
[21:09:34] <thomedy> but for now i have to take care of my kids
[21:09:36] <rodd> cool
[21:09:47] <andrewhl> thomedy: are you aware of shopify?
[21:09:50] <rodd> at least it's a good place, I guess
[21:09:54] <thomedy> wha tis shopify and no
[21:09:58] <TheSisb> thomedy: Sleeping will improve your life and productivity.
[21:10:03] <andrewhl> thomedy: check it out
[21:10:04] <thomedy> also before i loose everyones attention
[21:10:18] <thomedy> i am stuck on one thing here i have been working on it for like a day in a half
[21:10:35] <andrewhl> thomedy: less preamble. Just state your question
[21:10:36] <thomedy> but i keep getting a floated: left div to wrap i would like it to stay on the line
[21:10:44] <thomedy> sorry i was typing it
[21:10:46] <rodd> fiddle?
[21:10:48] <TheSisb> lol what andrewhl said
[21:10:51] <thomedy> but i like the preamble thing
[21:10:53] <thomedy> cool word
[21:11:01] <thomedy> okay fiddle
[21:11:03] <thomedy> one sec
[21:11:06] <thomedy> im working on it right now
[21:11:26] <TheSisb> Sounds like a CSS issue to me
[21:11:37] <TheSisb> I'll still help though
[21:12:09] <shoky> thomedy: the real solution to your issue is to not use percentages for your div widths
[21:12:19] <andrewhl> thomedy: for CSS questions I would recommend #css
[21:12:19] <RobW> can someone help me? :|
[21:12:24] <thomedy> okay hey shoky...
[21:12:27] <shoky> hey
[21:12:38] <thomedy> i actually think it is my jquery but im willing to be wrong
[21:13:01] <shoky> your jquery is affecting css, of course..
[21:13:17] <shoky> but your css had those divs at 25% width
[21:13:22] <TheSisb> Less chatting more fiddling
[21:13:23] <TheSisb> :P
[21:13:26] <shoky> and then you animate the width
[21:13:27] <thomedy> ha ha
[21:13:29] <thomedy> okay one sec
[21:13:52] <rodd> damn slow windows
[21:13:58] <RobW> I have an attached "position:absolute" div after another div that's expanding.. for some reason, the DOM doesn't update the attached div until animations are complete. Can anyone take a look? http://tinyurl.com/cjeyr32 -- Click on the arrow.. notice how it disappears until animation is complete.
[21:14:22] <shoky> RobW: it's cause the animation is adding overflow:hidden to your elements
[21:14:56] <TheSisb> what shoky said
[21:15:22] <RobW> hm
[21:15:34] <RobW> Why is firebug slow to show animation values
[21:15:51] <shoky> chrome shows them just fine
[21:16:00] <TheSisb> Firefox on ubuntu shows them fine
[21:16:17] <RobW> On windows, firebug doesn't show the animated values until after the animation is complete heh
[21:16:46] <RobW> Thanks shoky: added .css('overflow', 'visible')
[21:16:46] <TheSisb> odd :)
[21:17:15] <TheSisb> I like your "One moment" fadeaway
[21:17:59] <TheSisb> Especially since your hit with large font text immediately after
[21:18:13] <RobW> heh
[21:23:24] <thomedy> okay that took a sec
[21:23:26] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/cf9yB/
[21:23:47] <RobW> hey guys, actually, setting overflow to visible won't work right.. I'm wanting to "blind" this drawer
[21:24:04] <thomedy> im trying not to write any hacks but a legitimate solution...
[21:24:37] <thomedy> i want 100% of the viewport filled without any hickups in motion and i want smooth transitions
[21:24:45] <thomedy> i cant come up with anything solid yet
[21:28:11] <TheSisb> 100% fluid is a headache for sure
[21:28:36] <thomedy> do you see the goal in mind by watching the animation i think  my design is fairly slick
[21:28:38] <TheSisb> I don't even know where to begin with you fiddle code, the indentation is really off :P
[21:28:46] <thomedy> sorry
[21:28:52] <TheSisb> It's slick for sure
[21:29:01] <thomedy> i have been jsfiddling with the actuall code for 3 days on this thing or something
[21:29:05] <merlin1978> systemfault: I am sure jQuery is properly included because I could use $('#editTxt')
[21:29:12] <TheSisb> But it might be easier to have fixed width columns and a faux-fluidity
[21:29:21] <shoky> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/cf9yB/1/
[21:30:01] <TheSisb> shoky you're fast..
[21:30:03] <thomedy> if you think that will work my concern is cross-browser and a legitamet solution ill check that out right now shoky your last idea while greatly appreciated (shoky) wasn't really what i had as a end-result in mind
[21:30:21] <shoky> TheSisb: i already saw his code this week  ;)
[21:30:27] <TheSisb> oh
[21:30:28] <TheSisb> lol
[21:30:32] <TheSisb> I was freaking out
[21:30:40] <shoky> i tried to fix it while keeping the width:100%
[21:30:46] <shoky> but that just doesn't work
[21:31:21] <thomedy> he did i have been stuck on this stupid wrap thing for a while
[21:31:30] <thomedy> maybe its just me shoky but that doesn't really work...
[21:31:41] <TheSisb> I've attempted making multiple sites with % widths and it's really troublesome to get right.  And even if you do, adding new things is almost impossible
[21:31:45] <shoky> works for me
[21:32:05] <thomedy> if you expand the screen that shows the results and fiddle with some of the buttons
[21:32:10] <thomedy> text is all over the place
[21:32:14] <thomedy> just clicking around
[21:32:39] <thomedy> my goal is to accomodate 9 inch netbooks and 17 inch monitors blah blah blah
[21:32:43] <thomedy> its why its fluid
[21:32:47] <TheSisb> Because you can't have arbitrary 30% values
[21:33:36] <shoky> thomedy i dont see what you mean
[21:33:40] <thomedy> really
[21:33:42] <thomedy> hmmm
[21:34:18] <thomedy> i will admit i have a dying machine so it might be my machine but if i click the w in the sub menu at the top left it slides over to the womens slide and the women is far right and the sub menu is missing
[21:34:24] <thomedy> do you get that or is it my machine
[21:34:35] <thomedy> also i opened up the size of the results window
[21:34:38] <shoky> the w ?
[21:34:43] <thomedy> top left
[21:34:51] <TheSisb> Works for me clicking on W
[21:34:53] <thomedy> its how i slide back and forth between products
[21:34:56] <thomedy> okay thank you
[21:35:01] <thomedy> then im going to trust you...
[21:35:13] <thomedy> like  i said have a dying machine
[21:35:13] <shoky> i donno u got some weird shit there
[21:35:14] <TheSisb> But if it doesnt work for you, then it wont work for others :P
[21:35:20] <shoky> what's that wcd thing
[21:35:23] <thomedy> see that is always something i think about
[21:35:33] <thomedy> well eventually shoky those will be icons i have yet to draw
[21:35:42] <thomedy> but w is women, c is children, d is designer
[21:35:44] <thomedy> m is men
[21:35:49] <shoky> o
[21:36:02] <thomedy> i dont know wha ti want the icons to look like yet but they will be smal and simple like 10 px
[21:36:31] <TheSisb> thomedy: I know you've already spent a lot of time on this, but I highly suggestr you draw it all out on paper, then do all the markup , then the CSS, and lastly the JS
[21:37:18] <thomedy> i need to start that but theres still so much i dont understand in the dom, and jquery script and how commands will behave due to propogation and bubbling and what not that i dont have a clue how i would do all that
[21:37:45] <thomedy> i remember having to do the full pseudocode in college for c++ OR JAVA but in those languages there is very little the machine does without you telling it to
[21:37:45] <TheSisb> Thats why you make it looks as perfect as you can with HTML & CSS
[21:37:49] <TheSisb> then the JS will be easy
[21:37:57] <thomedy> well without the js it does look good
[21:38:00] <thomedy> thats what i did first
[21:38:06] <thomedy> it looks perfect actually
[21:38:11] <thomedy> its when i start animating stuf
[21:38:22] <TheSisb> Only the initial state, make at least one of the animated states
[21:38:28] <TheSisb> Like Women open the rest closed
[21:38:37] <thomedy> oh i htink i see.
[21:38:42] <thomedy> i never thought of that
[21:38:45] <thomedy> lesson learned
[21:38:55] <thomedy> future tense see both versions
[21:38:59] <thomedy> and then animate
[21:39:01] <TheSisb> Yes
[21:39:14] <thomedy> yeah i guess it makes sense
[21:39:39] <TheSisb> This lesson will save you tons of time in the future
[21:39:42] <thomedy> thank you
[21:39:47] <TheSisb> np
[21:40:05] <merlin1978> Why do i get TypeError: $("#affiliate-dlg").dialog is not a function    http://pastie.org/4090079   I am sure I have included jquery and jquery-ui in the page
[21:40:22] <thomedy> i really do want to get to the point where i can plan a head i was just telling my wife this tonight or yesternight i dont know but i just know so little about the goings on behind the script
[21:40:59] <thomedy> shoky what is it that you changed as it that overflow thing again cuz i couldnt' figure out what element you wanted me to change
[21:41:33] <thomedy> did you change anything in jquery
[21:41:36] <TheSisb> merlin1978: Full src.  Might be your including the jquery and jquery ui AFTER that code
[21:42:03] <shoky> thomedy: the fix i did now is different than i did for you before
[21:42:04] <merlin1978> TheSish: this is how I included the js files  http://pastie.org/4090060
[21:42:17] <thomedy> would a copy paste help
[21:42:23] <thomedy> can i ask wha tyou changed
[21:42:43] <merlin1978> TheSish: jquery-ui should be first to be included then next jquery?
[21:43:42] <shoky> thomedy: now? i removed the width:100% from overflow-container and the width:25% from overflow
[21:43:54] <thomedy> did you okay
[21:43:56] <shoky> thomedy: and changed their width in the code instead
[21:44:05] <TheSisb> merlin1978: Put the CSS, then jQuery, then jQuery UI in between the <head></head> tags
[21:44:06] <thomedy> may i ask why
[21:44:06] <shoky> thomedy: based on the window width
[21:44:13] <TheSisb> put your JS right above the </body> tag
[21:44:15] <thomedy> im sorry what do you mean by that
[21:44:17] <TheSisb> to test
[21:44:25] <thomedy> based on window width
[21:44:38] <shoky> thomedy: the current width of the window/frame
[21:44:48] <thomedy> isn't that what %'s do
[21:45:23] <shoky> thomedy: you had content-overflow at 100%. meaning it takes exactly 100% of the window width all the time
[21:45:28] <merlin1978> TheSisb: I will try
[21:45:29] <thomedy> right
[21:45:30] <shoky> thomedy: then you had the overflows on 25%
[21:45:33] <thomedy> right
[21:45:34] <shoky> thomedy: that is fine
[21:45:54] <shoky> thomedy: then you animate the overflow widths, one of them grows, the other 3 shrinks
[21:45:58] <thomedy> right
[21:46:21] <shoky> thomedy: while that animation is happening, at first the total width of the 4 overflows goes to more than 100%
[21:46:30] <thomedy> yeah...
[21:46:36] <shoky> thomedy: thats when you saw the white flash
[21:46:38] <thomedy> pretend im nodding
[21:47:00] <thomedy> ... im nodding
[21:47:31] <shoky> thomedy: so because their total width was more than 100% ,  the last div on the right had to go to the "next row", offscreen
[21:48:12] <shoky> thomedy: because the overflow-container width is not more than the window width, but it is equal to window width, then the last div on the right must go to next row, and cant just stay floated on the right
[21:48:15] <shoky> thomedy: something like that
[21:48:43] <shoky> thomedy: so i changed the overflow-container width to 10000px  so that the div on the right has enough space on the right, when the animation pushes it a bit
[21:49:21] <shoky> thomedy: and the overflow width still to 25%, but 25% of the window, not 25% of the overflow-container
[21:49:25] <thomedy> see i thought about that my idea was to make it 200% more with the original content containerand i made it a % cuz i was already doing all %
[21:49:43] <thomedy> but px makes more sense i guess
[21:50:35] <thomedy> you know what though thats why the menus slide so far to the right but i can prob come up with solution that works
[21:51:29] <thomedy> yeah that will work... the god aweful whitespace is gone and i can reduce the % of the side menus
[21:51:48] <thomedy> i had the right idea but maybe a over all container that was a % wassn't right
[21:51:53] <thomedy> i dont feel so bad
[21:51:58] <thomedy> thats a simple fix
[21:53:46] <thomedy> can i ask why a container of % wouldn't have worked cuz this was one of the solutions i had but i tried in % px totally works it seems and tahnk you
[21:54:26] <thomedy> okay yep
[21:54:29] <thomedy> that was all it took
[21:54:35] <thomedy> % = bad px = good
[21:54:51] <thomedy> im going to put it live and you guys can see
[21:54:54] <thomedy> if yo0u want
[21:54:59] <thomedy> shoky thank you very much
[21:55:07] <thomedy> im working hard at being awesome like you
[21:59:35] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[21:59:39] <thomedy> just a little bit left
[21:59:47] <thomedy> and then i get to launch
[22:00:10] <thomedy> i have made so many different looks for this stupid business. but this one is good
[22:00:20] <thomedy> and when i do the webgl version it will also be awesome
[22:00:23] <thomedy> im syked
[22:00:28] <thomedy> psyched
[22:01:34] <shoky> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/cf9yB/2/
[22:01:38] <shoky> made a few more changes
[22:01:52] <shoky> but you still have a lot of percentages stuff that i didnt look at
[22:02:06] <shoky> now i also added background color to the actual .overflow divs
[22:02:29] <thomedy> okay...
[22:02:58] <thomedy> what is it that you changed
[22:03:13] <thomedy> by the way... if you didn't catch it earlier thank you super post thank you
[22:03:30] <shoky> np
[22:03:43] <shoky> some stuff, nothing dramatic, you can find the differences..
[22:04:06] <shoky> added more stuff to depend on the window width instead of percentages
[22:04:38] <thomedy> maybe im just tired but i honestly dont see the difference between "depends on window width" and % because i thought % = window width
[22:05:06] <shoky> % in css is related to the elements container element
[22:05:27] <shoky> like.. if you had 25% on your overflow, then it means 25% of overflow-container
[22:05:43] <shoky> but now i made it 25% of the window width. not of whatever container the element might have
[22:05:59] <thomedy> oh i guess that would have been my problem not understanding that
[22:06:27] <shoky> because i made overflow-container much wider than the window
[22:06:36] <shoky> then i dont want to use regular css percentages
[22:07:14] <thomedy> hmmmm....
[22:07:18] <thomedy> teach me maestro
[22:07:36] <shoky> otherwise it would look like: http://jsfiddle.net/cf9yB/3/
[22:07:42] <shoky> because it takes 25% of 10000px
[22:07:48] <shoky> and not of the window width
[22:08:03] <thomedy> i see what you did with window.Width
[22:08:18] <thomedy> one of my concerns was recalculating window width with every resize
[22:08:28] <shoky> i took care of that there..
[22:08:35] <thomedy> which would have to happen to create fluid layout i would imaging is that not so hard on the machine
[22:08:44] <rabbi1> how to hide a div content only on one tab inside list of query UI tabs ? and display it on other tabs .?
[22:08:47] <aqeel> hi room
[22:09:03] <thomedy> basically i was trying to lift with my legs kinda thing
[22:09:10] <thomedy> give the heavy work to the strongest muscles you know
[22:09:31] <shoky> you were trying to let the browser do the calculations for you ;p
[22:09:32] <aqeel> rabbil jsfiddle?
[22:09:39] <shoky> which is usually good, but a bit less flexible
[22:09:58] <thomedy> cool..
[22:10:09] <aqeel> guys/gals any used css3pie with jquery on ie8?
[22:10:19] <thomedy> cuz i have done resizing on the fly before but in the past i have not been as aware of efficiency and smooth animations
[22:10:25] <thomedy> im really trying to focus onthe details
[22:10:31] <thomedy> becuase people pay for shiny
[22:10:34] <rabbi1> aqeel: will try, but its just a <div> content and want to hide it one tab and not on other tabs ( i am using jquery UI Tabs )
[22:11:11] <aqeel> well u cana aid each tab...and hide with css classtoggle
[22:11:17] <aqeel> add*
[22:11:22] <thomedy> what i have done so far is to set overflow container to 4000px cuz i cant think of a single monitor tha will hit 4000
[22:11:40] <thomedy> if you can i can change i tot  window.width and (window).resize()
[22:11:52] <thomedy> or maybe its (document).resize()
[22:11:57] <thomedy> but
[22:12:22] <aqeel> what exactly are you trying to do...
[22:12:50] <aqeel> why that width ....make tab of  text width long and obly takes almost half of screen/
[22:13:44] <aqeel> width can be made to take the mon size...and tab make it as long as its text goes...
[22:14:18] <aqeel> by the way for tab hiding and showing.....
[22:14:47] <aqeel> give each tab an id ..tab 1 id1,tab 2 id2, tab 3 id3.....
[22:15:23] <aqeel> then hide all ........show only tab1 id1....
[22:16:06] <aqeel> then when on tab 2, hide all, show tab 2
[22:17:23] <shoky> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/59n5L/
[22:18:27] <rabbi1> shoky: tnks a lot. BRB
[22:19:09] <aqeel> well my problem is css3pie is getting out of syn on ie8
[22:19:23] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com......view in ie8?
[22:19:51] <aqeel> and no emulation....better be vm or real deal...
[22:20:12] <aqeel> ie tester, microsoft web preview all fail
[22:23:03] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks, can u have a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/59n5L/1/  and suggest me how to hide the div named class ="commondiv" ??
[22:23:34] <rabbi1> shoky: i actually don't want to hide a complete tab .... the div is on the end of the html frame ....
[22:23:43] <mynotes> rabbi1:
[22:24:23] <shoky> rabbi1: why do you have an extra div inside your tabs div?
[22:25:35] <rabbi1> shoky: for me the first tab is list data and second is add data and a submit button, i need this submit button to be hidden in the list data tab but displayed in all following tabs .......
[22:26:17] <shoky> rabbi1: the tabs docs tell you how to structure your tabs
[22:26:27] <shoky> rabbi1: you're not following it
[22:26:44] <aqeel> i think he want s to hide a button and sjhow in other places..
[22:26:46] <shoky> rabbi1: you should have the <ul> with links, and then one <div> for each tab
[22:26:54] <shoky> but you have an extra div
[22:26:58] <rabbi1> shoky: ok, then how can achieve i want ? :(
[22:27:12] <shoky> if you want that content in the tabs, put it in the tabs..
[22:27:17] <shoky> in each tab that you want it in
[22:27:36] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, that extra <div> has a submit button which should be displayed in other tabs .... can't i do that ?
[22:27:58] <shoky> rabbi1: for example: http://jsfiddle.net/59n5L/3/
[22:28:17] <rabbi1> shoky: that div can be out of tab div also, doesn't matter where it is but should not display on first tab. that's  it
[22:29:01] <rabbi1> shoky: i tried that but din't work... will have a look at your code again
[22:29:14] <shoky> rabbi1: then add a 'select' event and do whatever you want inside it
[22:29:17] <aqeel> rabbil create instances and place it along with tabs u want
[22:30:03] <rabbi1> shoky: should be added in all div...... but as it's a form submit. what i have here, and form starts from tab2 through tab5 .... and a single submit button. can i use your example ?
[22:30:33] <aqeel> no u cannot have single button for all...
[22:30:49] <aqeel> each form has its own submit button
[22:30:55] <rabbi1> aqeel: it's a single form element :(
[22:31:22] <aqeel> well u are not explaining your problem clear enough
[22:31:30] <rabbi1> aqeel: yeah, one single form and only one submit button, but that form is divided into different tabs

[22:35:44] <aqeel> so any wann give a try at my situation
[22:35:45] <Ukto> *cant
[22:36:06] <shoky> Ukto  data[i] ..
[22:36:35] <shoky> er data[a] ;)
[22:36:52] <shoky> assuming data is an array, of course.
[22:37:26] <ENQ> i have a question, more about javascript, example: http://fiddle.jshell.net/a8fs3/
[22:37:26] <Ukto> hmm when i try that.. $("#workerData-name").html(data[wid[1]]['name']);   wid[1] has the id number
[22:37:30] <Ukto> it doesnt run
[22:37:38] <ENQ> function returns reference to my config doesnt it?
[22:37:41] <shoky> doesnt run ?
[22:37:45] <Ukto> doesnt trigger heh
[22:37:51] <shoky> trigger what?
[22:37:51] <Ukto> alert says it should do something
[22:37:56] <shoky> huh
[22:37:59] <Ukto> its not writing the html :P
[22:38:10] <shoky> ok, so check why..
[22:38:10] <Ukto> the data stored in data[1]['name'] in this case
[22:38:24] <shoky> check what's wid[1], what's data[wid[1]], etc..
[22:38:33] <shoky> programming, bro
[22:38:41] <Ukto> i can just write data[1]['name'] and it works, i can alert wid[1] and it has 1 in it
[22:39:01] <shoky> and?
[22:39:28] <Ukto> however when i put wid[1]  for the index and do data[wid[1]]['name'] it doesnt output the data stored in [1][name]
[22:39:32] <aqeel> well any know how to trigger onmove....
[22:39:35] <shoky> what about data[wid[1]] ..
[22:40:33] <shoky> Ukto: also dont trust alert. log to your console
[22:41:44] <Ukto> i do alert(wid[1]) and get 1, i do alert(data[wid[1]]) and i get no alert at all
[22:42:03] <Ukto> jquery seems to blowup when i nest arrays like that
[22:43:42] <Ukto> if i do var wid = 1; alert(data[wid]['name']); i get nothing, if I do alert(data[1]['name']); i get what I should
[22:45:39] <aqeel> for array should not this be like this......wid=[1]
[22:46:06] <aqeel> then data[wid] might work
[22:46:11] <shoky> Ukto: alert(wid[1] == 1)
[22:48:49] <shoky> Ukto: jsfiddle

[22:58:55] <coder2> Can i use http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/  for multiple selection of elements in mobiles where there is no ctrl button or mouse so i can hold them?
[23:04:30] <ENQ> i have a weird issue, i cant return non jquery object out of my plugin
[23:04:41] <ENQ> even then i call a function witch returs a value
[23:05:02] <ENQ> could this be related with $.each?
[23:05:31] <ENQ> ahh, i see know..
[23:06:04] <ENQ> then i have another question
[23:06:13] <ENQ> how to return value out of each loop? :)
[23:06:23] <ENQ> or array of values
[23:08:32] <[Arekana]> what i mostly do when i need something like that done i just call a functie every time the loop loops and let that functie handel that data in a way i need it handelt
[23:08:35] <Cork> ?.map @ ENQ
[23:08:36] <bot-t> ENQ, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[23:08:49] <Cork> ENQ: an each loop can't return anything
[23:09:17] <ENQ> thnaks Cork i think this will do the job
[23:09:20] <Cork> hmm, thats not the correct link
[23:09:28] <Cork> ?jquery.map @ ENQ
[23:09:29] <bot-t> ENQ, jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[23:09:34] <Cork> there you go
[23:09:51] <ENQ> :)
[23:10:18] <ENQ> this way my plugin still be chainable?
[23:10:31] <ENQ> if i return value out of getters and this out of other functions
[23:10:48] <Cork> if your plugin returns something other then jquery, no its not
[23:15:03] <varnie> hello
[23:18:43] <jankowiak> I wrote a script with jq that runs inside an iframe, the script pulls data from a webservice and displays it
[23:18:54] <jankowiak> In FF, Safari and Chrome it works fine
[23:19:14] <jankowiak> but in IE and Opera it never triggers the init script
[23:19:59] <Cork> jankowiak: and what event are you listening for?
[23:21:57] <jankowiak> Cork: I just have a couple of inititialization and adding a .on listener for clicks for a div
[23:24:18] <jankowiak> Basically this is what I'm doing: http://pastie.org/4090602
[23:25:02] <jankowiak> the 'pa' that shows up was typo while formating the code...
[23:27:57] <Cork> jankowiak: what init code are you talking about?
[23:28:45] <Trisox> whoee webkit nightly got css var suport :) like less sass and stuff
[23:28:59] <jankowiak> the getJSON and storing the returned value for later use
[23:29:23] <Brooke> I'm the sassmaster.
[23:36:37] <Koganei> so I want to do something like var foo = getSomething(); and getSomething goes get something in ajax and returns that data, but I'm not sure how to send it back to getSomething since it's asynchronuous
[23:37:11] <Koganei> does that makes sense? :o
[23:38:31] <Koganei> like http://jsfiddle.net/HbYBg/1/
