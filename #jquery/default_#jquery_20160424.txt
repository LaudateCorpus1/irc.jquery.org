[02:30:23] <hwdyki> how can i change the request parameters in datatables in reaction to an event?
[02:31:29] <hwdyki> basically i have a combobox that, when changed would cause datatables to reload the request from the server with new parameters extracted from the combobox.
[07:00:04] <paracusia> hello, when entering "39.9-1.2" in browser.console, it returns "38.699999999999996" - why is not 38.7 returned?
[07:08:32] <daslicht> funny
[07:09:19] <daslicht> just round it :)
[07:15:27] <shoky> paracusia: same reason that 0.1+0.2 won't give 0.3  :)  because of binary floating point math
[07:16:12] <paracusia> ty
[07:16:46] <shoky> it's the same in many languages
[07:16:57] <paracusia> in php also?
[07:17:55] <shoky> i think php converts to string and will shorten it by default because it doesn't show full precision
[07:19:28] <shoky> but it's same in c/c++, ruby,python,java,c# among others
[07:20:30] <shoky> it's the same in php too, just it doesn't show the full thing by default
[07:21:35] <daslicht> @shoky: thank you for teh info
[09:48:09] <AlexN2009>  what am i doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/mSduSAyz the js does not execute expand/collapse. it's a simple question
[09:54:46] <jfive> Alex231: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1418613/how-to-define-variable-in-jquery
[09:55:18] <jfive> Alex231: i could be wrong, but i think you want to set those variables like this: var header = $(this);
[09:56:14] <jfive> Alex231: another thing i see wrong is, you should be using on() not click() if you're using jquery 1.12.x so it'd be:
[09:56:25] <jfive> $(".header").on('click', function() {
[09:58:17] <jfive> Alex231: and check your browser's console, me i see this error: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[09:59:04] <jfive> oh sorry nm, i wasn't loading jquery in on the jsfiddle hehe
[09:59:23] <jfive> Alex231: seems to work here: https://jsfiddle.net/w7at4ndt/
[09:59:51] <jfive> Alex231: and that's with no changes to your code
[16:27:07] <niek> hello! i’m using the event onresize to add elements if there’s room
[16:27:20] <niek> but deleting them when the room is getting smaller doesn’t work
[16:27:52] <niek> i’ve read about jquery events, but this is part of one, I don’t understand how I would use that
[17:39:03] <R13ose> How do I assign and remove classes dynamically on click and scrolling?
[21:51:54] <R13ose> If I want to click from one page to another, how do I put a class active after on that link?  Code: http://pastebin.com/QZwduMni
[21:57:48] <geri> hi, why is jsfiddle reporting this error and how to fix it? https://jsfiddle.net/xwsggexn/1/
[21:59:25] <jrockjiggz> The subject in this chan hasn't been updated since Jan 26, 2015
[21:59:35] <R13ose> jrockjiggz: what should this say?
[21:59:46] <R13ose> geri: need to know error
[22:00:11] <jrockjiggz> R13ose: it's fine
[22:05:43] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[22:18:41] <geri> R13ose: i get the error: Mixed Content: The page at 'https://jsfiddle.net/xwsggexn/1/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.js'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[22:19:32] <geri> than i changed to https and get this error: GET https://cdn.leafletjs.com/leaflet/v0.7.7/leaflet.js net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE
[22:19:50] <geri> R13ose: any idea?
[22:20:10] <R13ose> Are they real errors
[22:20:29] <geri> look at the jsfiddle
[22:20:33] <geri> i get the error there
[22:20:46] <geri> R13ose: https://jsfiddle.net/xwsggexn/1/
[22:21:49] <R13ose> geri: this error I get: Uncaught ReferenceError: L is not defined
[22:44:25] <R13ose> If I want to click from one page to another, how do I put a class active after on that link?  Code: http://pastebin.com/QZwduMni
[22:53:01] <albedoa> "This page has been removed!"
[22:53:04] <albedoa> R13ose
[22:53:30] <R13ose> albedoa: http://pastebin.com/Gkq4uWVL
[23:14:23] <R13ose> albedoa: any thoughts?
[23:15:50] <albedoa> R13ose trying to guess your implementation. looks like you wouldn't need some of the selectors on the click event, nor would you need line 3
[23:16:18] <R13ose> albedoa: do you want me to pm you the address?
[23:16:20] <albedoa> i'm not really sure what's going on though. a fiddle would be helpful
[23:16:35] <albedoa> sure, i can give it a show
[23:16:36] <albedoa> shot
[23:17:37] <R13ose> albedoa: The code is for the middle three menu items.
[23:18:18] <albedoa> right
[23:19:30] <R13ose> albedoa: if this is solvable, there is one more problem after that.
[23:20:09] <albedoa> i would do $('#cb-main-menu').on('click', 'li', function() { ... });
[23:20:31] <albedoa> attach the event to the menu, then delegate to the li items
[23:20:40] <albedoa> then inside the function just toggle the class
[23:21:03] <albedoa> (or apply style with jquery, but it looks like you want to use a css class)
[23:21:34] <R13ose> let me try, give me a few mins
[23:22:47] <jrockjiggz> $('#menu li').removeClass('active'); $('#menu-item-634').addClass('active');
[23:24:38] <albedoa> oh you'll want to pass the event like function(event) so you can access the target :P
[23:24:46] <albedoa> and apply the class to it
[23:24:50] <albedoa> whoops
[23:25:59] <geri> R13ose: i dont understand why you cannot see the same error!?
[23:26:16] <R13ose> albedoa: can you explain "attach the event to the menu, then delegate to the li items"?
[23:26:27] <R13ose> geri: I do see that error, but I am going in order of the errors
[23:26:33] <geri> R13ose: the reason you see the following error is bc the js file cannot be loaded... error: Uncaught ReferenceError: L is not defined
[23:27:11] <albedoa> R13ose so just like i wrote above. you attach the event listener to the whole menu. then when the user clicks, it finds the target and acts on it
[23:27:48] <albedoa> $('#cb-main-menu').on('click', 'li', function(event) { /* do stuff to event.target here */ });
[23:32:41] <geri> R13ose: any workaround?
[23:33:04] <geri> R13ose: it works locally here, so it must be a jsfiddle issue
[23:35:20] <R13ose> geri: I am unsure
[23:36:28] <R13ose> jrockjiggz: I see that but what about moving from one page to another?
[23:37:23] <R13ose> geri: jsfiddle has some errors that other places don't
[23:37:32] <geri> R13ose: why is jsfiddle not able to load it over http?
[23:37:54] <geri> R13ose: is there an alternative to jsfiddle?
[23:37:54] <R13ose> not sure
[23:38:03] <R13ose> Google
[23:42:08] <jrockjiggz> L is not defined.
[23:43:59] <R13ose> :P
