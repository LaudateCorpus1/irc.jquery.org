[00:00:07] <Cork> slu9freek: if you have several scripts you need loaded, declare then as needed in the documentation
[00:00:10] <Cork> don't do magic
[00:00:20] <Cork> magic is normally a very big source of problems
[00:00:28] <Cork> and rarely much help
[00:00:54] <slu9freek> Cork: ok.. you sold me. I just think it's not very scalable to require them be present in the HTML..
[00:02:03] <Cork> slu9freek: well if you find it more scalable to have them spend hours debugging
[00:02:16] <Cork> and possibly ripping your lib apart to fix conflicts...
[00:02:41] <slu9freek> Cork: ha no.. but I don't really intend for these files to ever be separated.
[00:03:01] <Cork> slu9freek: if you really feel you want to isolate it
[00:03:20] <Cork> you might want to bundle it all as a iframe they include in the page instead
[00:03:42] <Cork> then you just say "extract it in folder /my-plugin, and point an iframe there"
[00:03:47] <Cork> done
[00:04:25] <Cork> but if you intend to be part of the page you have to text extra steps to make it easy to handle so no conflicts becomes hard to understand
[00:04:53] <Cork> that is why upfront is much better then magically loading
[00:06:00] <Cork> slu9freek: the reason i'm quite specifc about i this is cause i have both debugged a site having problems cause of magically loaded libs (and the entire matter was even more nice cause of racy ness in when the script was loaded)
[00:06:13] <Cork> and helped several users in here having problem cause of it
[00:06:30] <Cork> while "this script doesn't work" "you need to include lib x"
[00:06:36] <Cork> is usually quite easy to help with
[00:06:54] <Cork> and easy for the one needing help to understand
[00:07:16] <slu9freek> Cork: I see... I'm gonna run with html includes atm until I have a better reason not to i think
[00:15:12] <mikunos> hi guys I need a little help to understand how to create a simple inline editor. I have already written a little script but it doesn't work as well http://jsfiddle.net/mikunos/UJ5hZ/1/
[00:18:00] <mikunos> any hint?
[00:20:59] <Arko-> mikunos, try tinymce as editor
[00:21:03] <Arko-> Its got an inline function
[00:21:15] <Arko-> I have used it before to achieve something the same
[00:21:30] <mikunos> Arko- I need to use it in a free project
[00:21:39] <Arko-> tinymce is open source iirc
[00:21:45] <mikunos> and tinymce is too huge for this operation
[00:21:46] <Arko-> but its not for what you want, i see you are only trying to edit a name
[00:21:48] <Arko-> yeah
[00:21:57] <Arko-> Thought you wanted the whole text to be editable
[00:22:08] <Arko-> Why not insert a input box by default?
[00:22:10] <mikunos> try to click on the name
[00:22:14] <Arko-> And just style it so it looks like its not there
[00:22:19] <Arko-> remove border, etc
[00:22:22] <mikunos> it is just a draft
[00:22:56] <mikunos> oh a simple form with hidden border
[00:22:59] <mikunos> borders
[00:23:09] <mikunos> too simple :D
[00:23:11] <Arko-> http://jsfiddle.net/UJ5hZ/3/
[00:23:23] <Arko-> something like that
[00:23:34] <mikunos> yes I have understood
[00:23:37] <Arko-> alright :)
[00:24:07] <mikunos> I need to communicate the data directly with the "Model data" on the server side
[00:24:15] <Arko-> directly?
[00:24:28] <mikunos> I mean directly to the class
[00:24:28] <Arko-> you want to save the changes?
[00:24:37] <mikunos> yes of course
[00:24:44] <Arko-> ah, so no submit button?
[00:24:50] <mikunos> exactly
[00:25:02] <mikunos> the submit is when you leave the field
[00:25:33] <Arko-> alright sec
[00:25:39] <mikunos> thanks Arko-
[00:28:34] <Arko-> http://jsfiddle.net/UJ5hZ/4/
[00:28:38] <Arko-> This should help you out
[00:28:43] <Arko-> Try focusing the field, and then click away from it
[00:30:43] <mikunos> thanks
[00:51:13] <joobie> guys, onkeyup keeps losing focus on the input box i am in after keypress.. how can i stop this so focus is maintained?
[01:03:52] <anli__> Is there something that can disturb a kendoui swipe box to deliver swipe events, like some component listening on click in a child element etc?
[01:15:04] <Cork> anli__: not sure how kendo does event handling, but ya, most likely
[01:15:16] <Cork> it isn't very hard to mess with events
[01:32:05] <anli__> Cork: :)
[01:32:36] <anli__> I wiped away the child elements, still, no swipe events are generated from the swipe box...
[01:33:12] <anli__> The advantage with jquery, no errors are generated if I select something not existing, can also be a disadvantage...
[01:33:29] <anli__> Hard to decide if it is good or bad
[01:33:43] <Cork> it is usually not hard to find those
[01:34:05] <Cork> and it is a big advantage for writing error tolerant code
[01:34:08] <systemfault> It’s good… you don’t want an error. Returning an empty collection is the way to go.
[01:34:13] <Cork> so i put it as a big advantage
[01:34:40] <Cork> i still remember prototype.js with horror....
[01:34:47] * Cork shivers a bit
[01:35:11] <systemfault> I had the **cough** privilege to work on a codebase that had both jQuery and prototype...
[01:35:15] <systemfault> </hell>
[01:36:26] <Cork> systemfault: ya, same here
[01:36:39] <Cork> systemfault: but most of the hell came from prototype expecting to own the world
[01:37:21] <Cork> and as this was rails 1.3 it put scripts all over the freeking place
[01:37:59] <slu9freek> Do buttons render as block-level or inline by default?
[01:38:15] <systemfault> Right… makes me think… we had WEIRD bugs where prototype.js would add its own “.map/.forEach/etc”, replacing the native versions without checking if they existed..
[01:38:42] <systemfault> That made some really funny stack trace where you would see jQuery code using parts of prototype.
[01:39:09] <systemfault> slu9freek: Open your dev tools….
[01:39:21] <systemfault> Sometimes, experimentation is the key.
[01:40:16] <anli__> Seems like data-swipe and data-enable-swipe only works in chrome, not ff
[01:40:22] <slu9freek> systemfault: inline-block
[01:40:42] <systemfault> slu9freek: Yeah… hoped you thanked oksushi for the answer.
[01:40:50] <systemfault> *hope
[01:41:08] <slu9freek> systemfault: of course!
[01:41:24] * oksushi just saw the epic cross-post
[01:41:48] <slu9freek> ya.. my bad. that was pretty not cool huh?
[01:42:45] <Cork> systemfault: ya, ya i remember those errors
[01:43:31] <Cork> systemfault: and that reminds me of libs extending Array.prototype
[01:43:47] <Cork> and other libs doing for(v in array)...
[01:43:57] <Cork> OH, THE JOY! -_-'
[01:57:30] <ruz_34> hi all
[01:58:02] <ruz_34> i'm looking for some help to what must be a common issue with jquery ui tabs
[01:58:12] <Arko-> Whats your issue?
[02:00:28] <ruz_34> i've followed the online example to load content via ajax (passing to a php page with a switch i.e. <a href="switch.php?page=contactus">contact</a>) , I would now like to be able to target a specific tab to open with a standard link so it may be bookmarked..
[02:00:55] <ruz_34> I can do this with default functionality, not wondered if there are any tutorials on doing such a task via ajax loading?
[02:01:00] <ruz_34> I am new to jquery, btw
[02:01:31] <lobster6606> If I have lot of jquery to run for a specific id, can I break it up into multiple lines? Something like http://jsfiddle.net/9zhcN/. Just wondering if there's a right or wrong way
[02:03:07] <ruz_34> I know you can target a specific tab to show by using /index.php#tabsid with default functionality
[02:03:37] <ruz_34> Not sure on the process with ajax loading the content, I assume I may need to target the element before?
[02:03:46] <ruz_34> Can anyone offer any pointers?
[02:07:21] <ruz_34> anyone around?
[02:07:41] <narcarsiss> I have this code  that animates my progress bars but can someone help me add a bulge when reached 100% http://jsfiddle.net/S6Tv7/
[02:07:44] <Arko-> ruz_34, I think you have to append #tabId to your url
[02:07:47] <Arko-> iirc
[02:08:07] <Arko-> www.myurl.com/index.php?page=mypage#secondTab
[02:08:32] <ruz_34> that works fine with default functionality Arko-, but does it with ajax?
[02:08:59] <Arko-> What do you mean?
[02:09:06] <Arko-> Ah
[02:09:07] <Arko-> Uhm
[02:09:21] <Arko-> Not too sure, maybe you have to use hashchanges
[02:09:25] <Arko-> you should try it
[02:13:22] <ruz_34> Arko-, hash changes?
[02:13:39] <Arko-> Yes, you can use javascript or jquery to change your url hashes.
[02:14:01] <Arko-> That way you may be able to navigate through the tabs manually
[02:14:08] <Arko-> But as I said, im not too sure, you should test is out
[02:14:57] <ruz_34> I would have thought this is a common issue but cannot find a tutorial, etc on it
[02:17:11] <ruz_34> urmm thanks Arko-
[02:17:40] <Arko-> I dont think its an issue really
[02:18:45] <ruz_34> I can find no info on it Arko-, it could be me being foolish, not sure!
[02:19:34] <Arko-> What is your current situation, and what is exactly what you are trying to do?
[02:19:49] <Arko-> Maybe you can set up a fiddle, I am willing to help you out, but no idea what you have now and what you want to achieve.
[02:20:08] <ruz_34> i'm loading my content into tabs via ajax as per the online information for jquery ui tabs
[02:20:23] <Arko-> So the tabs are static, but the content is dynamic?
[02:20:29] <ruz_34> yes
[02:20:36] <ruz_34> so my tab link looks like this..
[02:20:37] <ruz_34> <li><a href="switch.php?page=aims">aims</a></li>
[02:20:37] <Arko-> Then AJAX has nothing to do with tabs
[02:20:48] <Arko-> hmm
[02:20:52] <_bart> Hi, so I'm watching for keypresses using .keypress, but now I add another input element and when I try to press keys within that it doesn't listen for them.
[02:20:57] <Arko-> So you want to load content as soon as someone clicks an tab?
[02:21:08] <Arko-> _bart, set up an fiddle
[02:21:11] <ruz_34> switch.php contains a switch statement on what to display based on the $_get of the page..
[02:21:35] <ruz_34> so say i have three tabs loading like this...
[02:21:45] <ruz_34> <li><a href="switch.php?page=contactus">contact</a></li>
[02:21:45] <ruz_34> <li><a href="switch.php?page=aims">aims</a></li>
[02:21:53] <Arko-> Okay.
[02:21:58] <ruz_34> it all works fine, the content is loaded via ajax
[02:22:10] <Arko-> So you are doing like an event.preventDefault() in your jquery?
[02:22:26] <ruz_34> no Arko-
[02:22:27] <Arko-> to prevent from really loading the page
[02:22:33] <Arko-> so is there a page refresh?
[02:22:52] <ruz_34> i'm just using the standrad code as suggested ..
[02:22:53] <ruz_34> $(function() {
[02:22:53] <ruz_34> 		$("#person_tabs").tabs();
[02:22:53] <ruz_34> 	});
[02:23:14] <Arko-> When you click an anchor, does your page reload?
[02:23:22] <ruz_34> all i want to now do is target to show a specific tab from a standard web link off another page
[02:23:51] <ruz_34> i.e. contactus loads by default
[02:24:14] <Arko-> So there is no AJAX in here?
[02:24:24] <Arko-> You just load a page, and want to select a tab?
[02:24:24] <ruz_34> but i want to create a weblink so when the "aims" tab is the one open
[02:24:40] <Arko-> then do something like
[02:24:41] <Arko-> uhm
[02:24:53] <Arko-> if your aims content div has id="aimsDiv"
[02:24:59] <Arko-> switch.php?page=aims#aimsDiv
[02:25:06] <Arko-> That should open aims tab by default
[02:25:55] <Arko-> If this is not what you mean, please give me url of your dev environment, so I can see it in action.
[02:26:26] <ruz_34> arko, I can do what you suggest in default mode.. <li><a href="#tabs-1">Preloaded</a></li>
[02:27:10] <ruz_34> however, when you specific <li><a href="ajax/content1.html"></a> according to documents that generates content to be loaded via ajax
[02:27:30] <Arko-> Yes
[02:27:31] <Arko-> ehm
[02:27:39] <Arko-> In your jQuery, where you add the contents to the specific tab
[02:27:58] <Arko-> do something like
[02:28:06] <Arko-> window.location.hash = 'contactusTab';
[02:28:21] <Arko-> That adds the contactusTab to your url, and should open that specific tab
[02:28:31] <ruz_34> here is the jquery ui examples..
[02:28:32] <ruz_34> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[02:29:16] <Arko-> Yes, I know the docs.
[02:29:49] <findegil> Hello everyone
[02:30:01] <Arko-> hi
[02:30:02] <ruz_34> hi findegil
[02:30:26] <ruz_34> sorry Arko-, head is scrambled, just not with you
[02:31:46] <ruz_34> ok, maybe i can phase the question another way
[02:32:02] <ruz_34> how do i make the tabs generated via ajax bookmarkable?
[02:32:37] <ruz_34> i.e. at the moment the page loaded into the tab via ajax is : http://localhost/siteinformation/switch.php?page=contactus
[02:33:06] <ruz_34> how do i make a specific tab able to be bookmarked?
[02:43:56] <lobster6606> If I have lot of jquery to run for a specific id, can I break it up into multiple lines? Something like http://jsfiddle.net/9zhcN/. Just wondering if there's a right or wrong way
[02:44:06] <brunoais> ruz_34, in a crude fully cross-browser way, impossible.
[02:44:30] <brunoais> ruz_34, if you are open to drop support for that funcitonality in order browsers, there are ways
[02:44:56] <systemfault> lobster6606: That’s exactly how most people do it.
[02:45:06] <systemfault> lobster6606: There is no “standard”
[02:45:07] <brunoais> ruz_34, but I still wonder if it really makes sense that those tabs dynamically generated
[02:45:50] <ruz_34> hi brunoais
[02:46:05] <brunoais> lobster6606, like systemfault said, there's no standard. Doing that way is perfectly fine and quite liegible.
[02:46:12] <lobster6606> systemfault: Thanks. Not sure why it breaks on me when I do it that way though
[02:46:18] <ruz_34> the outline of what i am doing is it is basically my site documents
[02:46:26] <brunoais> lobster6606, it's the ";"
[02:46:37] <systemfault> lobster6606: brunoais is right.
[02:46:38] <ruz_34> so on my homepage i want to direct a user to "contactus" and to the specific tab..
[02:46:46] <systemfault> lobster6606: There should only be a ; at the end.
[02:46:59] <systemfault> lobster6606: http://jsfiddle.net/9zhcN/1/
[02:47:01] <ruz_34> if i want to direct them to term and conditions, i just use a web link to direct them to that specific tab,
[02:47:03] <ruz_34> and so on
[02:47:28] <brunoais> ruz_34, then why are those tabs dynamically generated by js?
[02:47:30] <systemfault> lobster6606: I didn’t see that you added semi-colons everywhere :P
[02:47:55] <ruz_34> i know i could use default functionality to do that easily..
[02:48:02] <brunoais> lobster6606, At first glance, me neither
[02:48:11] <lobster6606> systemfault: yeah, so http://jsfiddle.net/9zhcN/2/ would work? just wondering because I though that it would be calling .parent().child()
[02:48:14] <ruz_34> switch.php uses a case function to include the relevant text file of information
[02:48:15] <brunoais> ruz_34, what default funcitonality?
[02:48:59] <ruz_34> so with default functionality a web link looks like this..
[02:49:00] <ruz_34> http://localhost/siteinformation/index.php#tabs-1
[02:49:02] <systemfault> lobster6606: Your code is now “valid”, I just don’t know if it does what you would like it to do.
[02:49:05] <brunoais> lobster6606, that's weird to do IMO. Don't do it. Use variables, in that case. Use only chaining when it's everything on the same DOM NodeList
[02:49:17] <brunoais> *same jQuery object
[02:49:19] <ruz_34> that link doe link to a specific tab
[02:49:44] <lobster6606> Ah got it. Thanks brunoais, systemfault
[02:50:17] <brunoais> ruz_34, hum... ok...
[02:50:50] <brunoais> ruz_34, I wouldn't do it using hashes, IMO
[02:50:56] <brunoais> I'd change the actual URL
[02:51:14] <brunoais> that way the server can serve the HTML with the correct default tab selected
[02:51:16] <ruz_34> when you load via ajax you cannot taget the tab like that, can you?
[02:51:32] <brunoais> ruz_34, why do you load the tabs using AJAX?
[02:51:36] <ruz_34> so brunoais, how do i establish that?
[02:52:07] <lobster6606> by the same theory, I could also set variables the same with with line breaks right? http://jsfiddle.net/9zhcN/3/
[02:52:14] <brunoais> ruz_34, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[02:52:16] <ruz_34> http://localhost/siteinformation/index.php#switch.php?page=contactus
[02:52:33] <ruz_34> i assume i cannot do that link to target a specific tab?
[02:52:43] <brunoais> lobster6606, you are missing the comma
[02:53:00] <brunoais> ruz_34, do you know what you have there :)?
[02:53:14] <lobster6606> got it, thanks
[02:53:33] <ruz_34> so brunoais, the simple answer is you cannot easily create a bookmarkable url when creating tabs with ajax?
[02:54:19] <ruz_34> with default functionality, easy, http://localhost/siteinformation/index.php#tabs-1
[02:54:28] <ruz_34> with default functionality, easy, http://localhost/siteinformation/index.php#tabs-2, etc will target a specific tab
[02:54:32] <brunoais> ruz_34, Oh.. hum... It's not trivial.. I wouldn't even make the tabs like that. It's slow. I'd get it all directly from the server without AJAX
[02:55:12] <brunoais> ruz_34, I'd load, at least, the tab the user wants when the page loads
[02:55:12] <ruz_34> but with default functionality you will have the entire contents of the tabs on one page?
[02:55:22] <brunoais> ruz_34, then do it like this:
[02:55:40] <brunoais> ruz_34, When page loads, include the contents in the HTML itself of the tab the user first selected to see
[02:55:56] <brunoais> use anchors in the tabs that allows the user to change tabs without the need of js
[02:56:22] <brunoais> when the js loads, it intercepts the clicks to those anchors and it can make the download of the relevant content when requested
[02:56:50] <brunoais> you may also, as an alternative, keep downloading the content of the most viewed tabs while idle
[02:56:56] <ruz_34> ahh, never thought of it like that
[02:57:06] <brunoais> that way you can instantly display the content as the user switches tabs
[02:57:20] <brunoais> you can also reduce the amount of js by a lot by doing that, making is more maintainable
[02:57:28] <brunoais> *it more
[02:57:58] <brunoais> make use of the progressive enhancement to your advantage
[02:59:13] <ruz_34> thanks brunoais, i just thought my way would have an easy solution..
[02:59:26] <brunoais> ruz_34, it's meh
[02:59:34] <brunoais> It may seem the easiest
[02:59:50] <brunoais> but the more js you have, the more you have to maintain cross-browser
[02:59:53] <SuperTyp> is there a notification plugin that shows a visitor, that new content has been added or changed and shows that in the menubar?
[02:59:55] <brunoais> even with the help of jQuery
[03:00:03] <ruz_34> thanks brunoais,
[03:00:16] <ruz_34> i may dump jquery ui tabs altogether then
[03:00:25] <ruz_34> why not just go css to create the effects!
[03:00:36] <brunoais> ruz_34, jQuery UI is very heavy. Use it only when needed
[03:01:00] <brunoais> ruz_34, in my case, I only do animations using CSS. I think animate.css is quite good. I never seriously used it yet, though
[03:01:06] <brunoais> I've been making animations myself
[03:01:59] <ruz_34> thanks for your help
[03:02:06] <brunoais> ruz_34, you can also use data-* attributes to store relevant information, like, for example, associating the tab with the content it relates to
[03:02:20] <anli__> I am receving a tap event in both a parent and a child, if I click in the child, the event propagates despite e.preventDefault(), there is no e.stopPropgation() because this is kendoui... anyone that have ideas about that?
[03:02:24] <brunoais> if the content exists, just display, otherwise, download it from the web
[03:03:03] <brunoais> anli__, does it have the IE style returnValue attribute?
[03:03:18] <anli__> Oh, must check
[03:04:03] <brunoais> anli__, the problem is that it will also activate the preventDefault() :S
[03:04:42] <anli__> It does not matter if I only need to use returnValue
[03:06:22] <anli__> alert(e.returnValue); gives me an empty gox
[03:06:23] <anli__> box
[03:06:25] <anli__> :)
[03:06:40] <anli__> e.returnValue = false; does not change anything
[03:07:13] <Cork> anli__: not sure but i think returnValue is deprecated
[03:07:18] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[03:07:29] <anli__> I dont want tap events to propagate
[03:07:55] <Cork> event.stopPropagation()
[03:07:56] <brunoais> Cork, it's old stuff
[03:08:04] <Cork> brunoais: yes i know
[03:08:06] <brunoais> Cork, it does not have stopPropagation()
[03:08:14] <Cork> brunoais: on what system?
[03:08:18] <anli__> Hm, isnt there some originalEvent thing
[03:08:27] <anli__> In which I can stop propagation
[03:08:33] <Cork> anli__: if it is that old, not likely not
[03:08:43] <Cork> though i would have to know what it is that is old...
[03:09:00] <brunoais> Cork, " there is no e.stopPropgation() because this is kendoui... anyone that have ideas about that?"
[03:09:19] <Cork> uh... what?
[03:09:40] <Cork> the only thing that could cause that would be if e wasn't event
[03:09:59] <beancurd> isn't kendoui built ontop of jquery?
[03:10:15] <brunoais> I thought it was a browser :D
[03:10:34] <Cork> it is
[03:10:46] <Cork> its a ui lib for jquery
[03:10:54] <Cork> quite new too
[03:11:01] <beancurd> by those telerik bastards.
[03:11:02] <Cork> so... not sure what the "old" was about
[03:11:18] <beancurd> hmm it's gotta be at least 2 years old?
[03:11:30] <Cork> it's newer then jquery-ui
[03:11:41] <Cork> as in newer since it's creation
[03:12:11] <anli__> e.event.stopPropagation(); seems to work
[03:12:27] <brunoais> -_-
[03:12:40] <anli__> Wonder if thats cross browser
[03:12:54] <beancurd> 2011
[03:12:57] <anli__> Must check if it at least is chrome
[03:13:03] <beancurd> was kendo beta
[03:13:24] <anli__> Seems like tap is not always received
[03:13:31] <anli__> Even if I set the doubleTapTimeout to 0
[03:18:28] <Cork> e.event.stopPropagation(); would indicate taht e isn't event
[03:19:00] <Cork> cause neither jquerys Event object or the standard Event object has an event member
[03:28:45] <aitiba> hi
[03:57:15] <Amnesthesia> Is there a way I can focus an input field *without* selecting the text?
[04:03:35] <xec> Amnesthesia: i don't know if you can, but a workaround i've used before is that after you focus the input you can overwrite its value with the current value
[04:03:50] <xec> Amnesthesia: http://jsfiddle.net/J9CQv/
[04:04:18] <Amnesthesia> Ah thanks!
[04:05:23] <Amnesthesia> is jquery.com down?
[04:06:16] <xec> looks like it, doesn't load for me either
[04:08:20] <xec> ?down jquery.com
[04:09:23] <b-ot> xec: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jquery.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[04:10:56] <xec> Amnesthesia: were you looking for something in particular?
[04:11:19] <Amnesthesia> xec: I was just trying to listen for a scroll event; it doesn't trigger for me
[04:11:27] <Amnesthesia> so I was just going to look that up a little bit closer
[04:20:36] <LekeFly> Hey, could someone help me with this.. i have 5 ratio buttons, when one of them is clicked i want to resize an iframe to a set size (height/width)
[04:21:37] <erming> Anyone know a library or plugin that can help when you're doing LOTS of animations. Chaining 20-30 .animate() doesn't really feel like the best option
[04:22:30] <erming> I'm thinking about simulating key-events onto inputs, like a demo of sorts
[04:26:24] <Cork> erming: i would look into solving it with css3
[04:26:33] <Cork> erming: you can do most animations through that
[04:26:56] <erming> Cork, even text input?
[04:29:46] <Cork> erming: text input?
[04:30:01] <Cork> erming: you mean like a typewriter animation or something like that?
[04:30:32] <erming> yeah
[04:30:49] <erming> I want it to look like someone is writing into an input
[04:30:56] <Cork> ?g jquery typewriter animation
[04:30:57] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Animated Typing with Typed.js | by Matt Boldt → http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/
[04:31:51] <erming> might be what i'm looking for. thanks!
[04:38:55] <erming> unfortunately not.. I need keydown-events to trigger, and it should work on textareas (typed.js uses .text() to set values, which doesn't work correctly for my use case)
[04:39:29] <erming> I'll roll my own "framework", this time around.. It'll be fun
[04:42:33] <erming> My idea: http://jsfiddle.net/B46z2/1/
[04:43:43] <Cork> erming: wait you need to fake keydown events??
[04:43:48] <Cork> why?
[04:44:04] <erming> http://erming.github.io/tabComplete/
[04:45:14] <erming> Going to make an interactive demo for it, and I need the "real thing" to actually happen
[04:46:00] <Cork> ah
[04:46:02] <erming> try to type "a" and then press tab multiple times.. That will iterate all matches
[04:46:11] <Cork> erming: that sounds more like you want to use a testing framework
[04:46:35] <erming> This was initially a sort of shell complete plugin, but now I've added hinting
[04:46:38] <Cork> there is quite a few for faking user input (both mouse, keyboard and so on)
[04:46:45] <erming> kk
[04:47:43] <Cork> erming: a 2 sec search https://github.com/mmonteleone/jquery.autotype
[04:49:21] <erming> just to show off, this is why I wanted a custom tabComplete (where tab iterates matches) to begin with: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4t0hibklqrinja5/chat_tabcomplete.PNG
[04:50:09] <erming> autotype looks nice!
[04:50:26] <ocm> jquery.com offline?
[04:50:44] <Cork> ?down jquery.com
[04:51:32] * Cork pokes b-ot 
[04:51:48] <b-ot> Cork: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jquery.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[04:52:08] <ocm> seems yes
[04:52:13] <erming> :D
[04:55:58] <ocm> fix it :D
[05:06:32] <Macaveli> I need to remove a line of html when the device is a tablet / phone . What's the best option for this is in jquery :)
[05:22:51] <seutje> is there a way to get at a (same origin) SVGs content and fiddle with it?
[05:23:07] <seutje> figured it'd be like messing with an iframe, but not getting anything from contents :(
[05:24:29] <Abhijit> hi. how can i create a simple drawing app to draw circles and drag them using only jquery. no third party library. where shall i start? not jq expert.
[05:28:35] <atmohsin> Hi i am not able to access jquery.com
[05:30:05] <Jattenalle> atmohsin, down for me as well, http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/jquery.com
[05:30:21] <seutje> `down jquery.com
[05:31:24] <b-ot> seutje: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jquery.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[05:36:08] <mattalexx> http://jquery.com/ and http://jqueryui.com/ seem to be down
[05:36:13] <mattalexx> What's that about?
[05:43:42] <Cork> mattalexx: its a spam attack on the channel
[05:43:58] <Cork> mattalexx: to get ppl to come here and ask if the site is down every 2 mins... >_<
[05:44:13] <Cork> mattalexx: joke aside, yes it is down
[05:45:12] <bberry> lol Cork
[05:45:41] <Cork> bberry: i was SOOOO close to add.. "deal with it"

[05:45:49] <b-ot> seutje: Scripting - SVG | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Scripting
[05:46:06] <phrearch> hi
[05:46:20] <bberry> maybe theyre doing a css overhaul to match that of MDNs changes
[05:46:35] <bberry> :P
[05:46:39] <Cork> bberry: ugg. i had to add overrides for mdn to make it usable...
[05:46:50] <seutje> ah, contentDocument is what I was looking for :)
[05:46:58] <bberry> haha
[05:47:22] <phrearch> im trying to check a list of checkboxes, but somehow they are only checked once. after i uncheck them again, and recheck, they show up in the dom as checked="checked", but they dont show as checked. any idea what may be wrong?
[05:48:08] <bberry> phrearch: how are you changing their checked state
[05:48:37] <bberry> phreach: also, showing code helps us determine what the real problem is, jsfiddle.com is your friend :D
[05:49:05] <phrearch> bberry: ok, i'll post an example there.
[05:49:15] <Cork> phrearch: sounds like you change attr not prop
[05:49:21] <bberry> ^
[05:49:26] <phrearch> Cork: yea i do
[05:49:28] <Cork> phrearch: you shouldn't fiddle with attr for checked
[05:49:37] <Cork> use .prop('checked' true/false)
[05:49:42] <Cork> *.prop('checked', true/false)
[05:49:46] <phrearch> cool, ill give that a true. thanks!
[05:49:50] <Cork> attr isn't safe and isn't cross browser
[05:50:02] <Cork> (the later is why the former)
[05:50:07] <bberry> when should you use attr
[05:50:13] <phrearch> yea thats it
[05:50:21] <Cork> bberry: ex if you want to grab href from a link
[05:50:28] <Cork> and not get the browsers fixed up url
[05:50:37] <phrearch> didnt know that. thanks for pointing it out
[05:51:27] <bberry> gotcha
[05:51:41] <Cork> basically .attr works around the state in the browser
[05:51:50] <Cork> some browsers watch attr for changes too
[05:51:53] <Cork> but it isn't meant for it
[05:52:13] <Cork> and attr('value') for an input field is guaranteed to be wrong
[05:52:30] <Cork> while .prop('value') should be the same as .val()
[05:52:56] <Cork> attr('value') would be what was in the html
[05:53:09] <Cork> while prop('value') is what is currently entered in the field
[05:53:18] <phrearch> ah yea thats more direct
[05:53:42] <Forbidd3n> anyone here have the time to help me with stellar parallax?
[05:56:45] <phrearch> how about $(this).is(':checked') ?
[05:57:16] <phrearch> is that doing the same thing underwater as $(this).prop('checked') ?
[05:57:29] <phrearch> or does that use attr as well
[05:58:05] <Cork> phrearch: at the end yes
[05:58:07] <_bart> The jQuery api website is slowwwwww
[05:58:13] <Cork> but it goes a long way to get there
[05:58:28] <Cork> phrearch: so prop('checked') is quite a bit faster
[05:58:39] <phrearch> Cork: ok thanks, then ill use it there as well
[05:58:39] <Cork> so i never see a point for .is(':checked')
[05:58:47] <phrearch> no indeed
[05:59:00] <Cork> especially as .prop('checked') is just as readable as is(':checked')
[06:00:30] <_bart> ok now the jQuery api is just down..
[06:00:57] <Forbidd3n> Here is what I have thus far. - http://ppu.blupointmedia.com - there is a white padding at the top of each slide when you scroll down. Not sure where this is coming from
[06:01:08] <Cork> _bart: the problem seen most likely propagates cross the cdn and that is what happens
[06:01:15] <Forbidd3n> I believe it is something to do with the header bar.
[06:07:44] <VesQ> I guess this has been asked a lot but what's happened to all jquery sites? They're down?
[06:07:47] <VesQ> http://isup.me/jquery.com
[06:08:29] <VesQ> quite tricky to work on our qunit tests as I can't see the API docs :(
[06:09:20] <Uhkis> ?down jquery.com
[06:09:26] <Forbidd3n> stellar.js or skrollr - which is easier to user and work with?
[06:10:23] <b-ot> Uhkis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jquery.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[06:14:57] <VesQ> ?down qunit.com
[06:15:02] <b-ot> VesQ: It's just you. http://qunit.com is up! (302 Moved Temporarily)
[06:15:11] <VesQ> oops, I meant..
[06:15:15] <VesQ> ?down qunitjs.com
[06:16:18] <b-ot> VesQ: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://qunitjs.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[06:16:45] <seutje> for most API references, you can grab an offline index for. similar to what apps like Dash do
[06:16:57] <seutje> although I'm not sure they grab qunit api by default
[06:16:58] <VesQ> yup. And it's been like that for at least 4 hours.
[06:17:12] <VesQ> well I'd really like to see that
[06:17:25] <VesQ> they point to building offline docs by setuping a jquery-wp clone
[06:17:43] <VesQ> but (ironically) the link to build instructions lead to jquery.com site
[06:17:48] <VesQ> which is down.
[06:18:08] <VesQ> so, no, so far I have no idea how to get offline docs fow qunit.
[06:20:23] <VesQ> ?down jqueryui.com
[06:20:28] <VesQ> everything's down... damnit.
[06:21:26] <b-ot> VesQ: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jqueryui.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[06:45:08] <Bauer> guys, I need help please.. why is this not working? http://pastebin.com/2Q7wxYKm when I invoke url2form function with second parameter as "_blank" its not doing anything at all. if I do as vcloud_frame (which is the name of the iframe) it works, but if I do it empty string "", its redirecting.. my goal is to just submit the form, but not show the results. I want to show the second link (line
[06:45:08] <Bauer> 11) in the IFRAME, AFTER line 9 executed successfully
[07:06:53] <Forbidd3n> I am attempting my parallax using skrollr. Anyone know how I can have the image start below the menu without using the background position of 200 as an attribute so it doesn't show whitespace when scrolliing? ppu.blupointmedia.com/skrollr/
[07:22:16] <VesQ> ah, luckily there's always web archive <3
[07:26:34] <bberry> silly noob question. what does the return value do for click handlers again? is it something with bubbling? cant remember...
[07:26:52] <bberry> or event handlers in general, for that matter
[07:29:53] <gnarf> Cork: in the future, can you ping the channel in #jquery-infrastructure for jquery.com outages? :)
[07:30:04] <Cork> gnarf: sure
[07:30:15] <gnarf> Cork: thanks - we were down for like 90 minutes before someone called me ;)
[07:30:25] <gnarf> #jquery had the first report I can find
[07:30:27] <Cork> gnarf: didn't even know about the channel
[07:30:33] <gnarf> and noone followed up :)
[07:30:47] <Cork> btw when i have you on the line
[07:30:50] <gnarf> Cork: yeah, and its not like you could go to the website to figure out how to contact us ;)
[07:30:54] <Cork> where should one file documentation bugs?
[07:31:06] <gnarf> Cork: for which documentation?
[07:31:11] <Cork> +http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/ <--
[07:31:16] <Cork> formIndex != 1.2
[07:31:22] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues
[07:31:28] <Cork> thx
[07:31:38] <gnarf> Cork: related: http://contribute.jquery.org/documentation/
[07:31:40] <gnarf> fix it yourself ;)
[07:31:46] <Cork> thx
[07:31:49] <Cork> XD
[07:33:27] <gnarf> or "patches welcome" whatever that is ;)
[07:37:31] <bberry> nice, didnt know any of that existed
[07:38:53] <NCS_One> hi
[07:39:05] <NCS_One> is there any plugin that works like select2 but allows new inputs? select2 link: http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[07:40:36] <gnarf> bberry: (almost) all of the jquery content is on github now
[07:40:54] <gnarf> the content team is in #jquery-content if you have any interest in helping, we are always looking for help with docs :)
[07:41:10] <gnarf> I've given a few talks about it
[07:41:47] <decx> so jquery.com WAS down
[07:41:54] <gnarf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BQ1SGddbLk
[07:42:03] <gnarf> decx: it was "unreachable" yes ;)
[07:42:04] <decx> i was just blaming my isp because the channel wasnt flooded with people not reaching the docs :>
[07:42:18] <Jattenalle> decx, you saw nothing, heard nothing, it was never down. pay no attention to the 404 behind the curtain!
[07:42:43] <gnarf> also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t61RoAs7E8
[07:43:39] <decx> damn that's like a 4 types of nerd routine :>
[07:47:09] <krambiorix> hi, in a script i have this : http://pastebin.com/dDetWiKs   . I include it in my code after I include jquery. When i focusout a field with class 'obligatory', nothing happens... (even if i put an alert in my code)... What can i do?
[07:48:42] <VesQ> ah, seems like jquery sites are up again. Too bad that http://status.jquery.com/ didn't help that much :p
[07:48:56] <gnarf> VesQ: thats not a thing
[07:49:08] <gnarf> though maybe we should make one
[07:49:29] <saml> does jquery include html template?
[07:49:35] <saml> http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/  something like this?
[07:49:57] <decx> no
[07:50:12] <gnarf> VesQ: I actually just deleted that DNS entry :)
[07:50:46] <gnarf> VesQ: I've been the Infrastructure lead for like 3 yrs now and never even knew we had DNS there ;)
[07:50:55] <gnarf> saml: not at all
[07:50:57] <krambiorix> anyone?
[07:51:38] <gnarf> krambiorix: you are never calling the IIFE
[07:51:48] <krambiorix> gnarf, ?
[07:51:52] <gnarf> i'd edit your paste but i can't
[07:51:56] <gnarf> the outer function closure
[07:52:02] <gnarf> (function($) { ..... });
[07:52:06] <gnarf> (function($) { ..... })(jQuery);
[07:52:09] <gnarf> ^^^ do that
[07:52:21] <gnarf> you need to call that function ;)
[07:52:30] <gnarf> you basically wrote a NO OP :)
[07:52:37] <gnarf> define this function, and never call it
[07:52:46] <gnarf> `iife
[07:52:46] <b-ot> gnarf: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/

[07:52:58] <saml> https://gist.github.com/saml/ab6a121038c7ae629462   is things like this okay?
[07:53:45] <krambiorix> gnarf , i added (jQuery); but no difference :s
[07:53:52] <gnarf> saml: I'd suggest just finding a good template lib and adding a dependency -

[08:38:29] <thebope> krambiorix, use $( to run the function when the page loads
[08:38:46] <thebope> krambiorix, http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[08:39:24] <thebope> If you have the actions defined anonymously then make a function to call from both so you're not repeating code and it's easier to maintain if you need to make changes to the actions
[08:39:42] <gnarf> thebope $('body') should resolve as long as the script tag is in the body tho ;)
[08:40:12] <thebope> gnarf, will it auto run an onchange?
[08:41:06] <decx> wasnt this about calling the change event on an element on load? that'd be .trigger('change')
[08:41:16] <thebope> decx, that seems like a better solution
[08:41:17] <duch_kazatel> Good morning everybody.
[08:41:33] <thebope> good morning duch_kazatel
[08:42:00] <ravenzz> trigger change on load? why? :p
[08:42:17] <duch_kazatel> calculating things from form inputs on load or something?
[08:48:20] <thebope> decx, although might end up putting it in a $(
[08:48:32] <thebope> So I guess it's two ways to bake the same pie
[08:49:35] <decx> i always wrap, safe sex&dom ready
[09:09:53] <Velveeta> decx: lol @ "safe sex&dom ready"
[09:16:14] <seutje> oh bugger... calling getSVGDocument on my object trigger the almighty "Unknown name" error in IE9 q.q
[09:26:37] <KarloE> hello
[09:26:47] <KarloE> i got a question
[09:26:55] <KarloE> I have an app made in canvas almost fully
[09:27:07] <KarloE> and I need to record swipe gesture in the canvas
[09:27:13] <KarloE> http://www.netcu.de/jquery-touchwipe-iphone-ipad-library this is what I tried to use
[09:27:23] <KarloE> but it doesnt register anything, neither on pc or mobile
[09:27:40] <KarloE> im not sure if I am doing something wrong because I never used jquery, I am not a web developer
[09:28:30] <KarloE> do I need to init jquery somehow ?
[09:28:58] <decx> jquery isnt really appropriate or useful if you're doing canvas work
[09:29:09] <KarloE> hm that sucks
[09:29:20] <decx> use hammer.js to implement touch methods that you can use
[09:29:33] <KarloE> it doesnt really work as it should
[09:29:41] <KarloE> maybe i should prevent default events hmm
[09:35:35] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:19:50] <ericg18> In my quiz app, I have list of options for each question with an is_selected class to indicate that those options were chosen.  If a user comes back to this question, I do a database lookup to add the is_selected class to each list item.  But if the user changes their selected options to something else, I would like to know.  Any jquery solution to detecting that the options selected have changed?
[10:20:29] <duch_kazatel> ericg18 depends on the markup.
[10:21:00] <duch_kazatel> if they're input tags, checkout out the change event
[10:23:39] <ericg18> duch_kazatel - not input tags.  Just list items.  thanks  I am thinking of adding yet another class, possibly called "previously-selected"... then do some comparing
[10:24:04] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing your code?
[10:24:12] <duch_kazatel> or an example of it?
[10:24:37] <duch_kazatel> because it's hard to suggest anything without seeing what you're doing/
[10:27:54] <ericg18> yeah... it's in django :)
[10:28:01] <ericg18> duch_kazatel >> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=87bZPEd1
[10:28:11] <duch_kazatel> rendered markup broseph.
[10:29:38] <ericg18> I think my class="prev-selected" is going to help achieve the goal
[10:29:54] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're doing something hacky.
[10:30:15] <ericg18> define hacky :)
[10:38:40] <ftj> Anyone know of a site like cofounderslab, et al, that makes it easy for people to team up to work on side projects?
[10:39:49] <duch_kazatel> Craigslist.
[10:39:53] <duch_kazatel> (i kid)
[10:40:50] <Velveeta> github?
[10:41:34] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: How would github work like that? Don't you just kind of barge in on projects?
[10:41:50] <Velveeta> exactly!
[10:41:53] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[10:42:03] <Velveeta> that's about as easy as it gets to team up to work on side projects :D
[10:42:15] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: HAha, fair enough.
[10:42:20] <BillCriswell> ftj: That's a good question.
[10:42:39] <BillCriswell> I imagine a site like that would be hard to filter out the... not very useful.
[10:43:10] <duch_kazatel> the question asked is kind of obstuse to begin with - "Sites like cofounderslab, and all the sites like it"
[10:43:24] <Velveeta> well i would assume it'd have some kind of rating system in place for various contributors?
[10:43:49] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Right, right.
[10:43:59] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, true.
[10:44:04] <duch_kazatel> pedant mode activate!
[10:44:19] <Velveeta> you can try searching something like this: related:cofounderslab.com
[10:44:30] <Velveeta> i bring up sites like founder2be.com, techcofounder.com, etc
[10:44:38] <BillCriswell> "founder dating"
[10:44:41] <BillCriswell> oh god.
[10:44:42] <Velveeta> yeah, that too
[10:44:47] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:44:50] <Velveeta> better than farmersonly.com :D
[10:44:51] <duch_kazatel> just... no.
[10:45:02] <duch_kazatel> silicon valley needs to stop.
[10:45:15] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[10:45:55] <BillCriswell> I need to find a side project.
[10:46:01] <Velveeta> oh wait, this is a jquery channel, i should probably phrase that answer in the form of a jquery function
[10:46:12] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[10:46:15] <Velveeta> $(window)[0].location.href = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=related%3Acofounderslab.com';

[10:46:45] <DagMoller> hi
[10:46:53] <rindolf> DagMoller: hi.
[10:47:05] <BillCriswell> Hi.
[10:47:13] <DagMoller> is possible to center a Dialog only horizontally?
[10:47:27] <duch_kazatel> hi
[10:47:40] <Velveeta> sure, just set its top equal to half the screen height minus half the dialog height
[10:47:51] <Velveeta> er, horizontally
[10:47:55] <duch_kazatel> DagMoller margin 0: auto;
[10:47:55] <Velveeta> do that to the other dimension
[10:47:55] <bberry> or do margin: 0px auto;
[10:48:01] <Velveeta> or yeah, that
[10:48:06] <duch_kazatel> bberry no need for the px when it's 0.
[10:48:15] <bberry> haha yeah, its a habit XD
[10:48:19] <DagMoller> let see
[10:48:22] <Velveeta> will margin 0 auto work on absolutely positioned elements?
[10:48:33] <PrinceStolas> anyone have any experience getting cross-domain POST requests to work in ie9
[10:48:42] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta nope.
[10:48:47] <bberry> Velveeta: not sure. i wouldnt think so
[10:48:51] <PrinceStolas> every solution we've found on the internet just posts a blank body to the server
[10:48:56] <Velveeta> aren't dialogs absolutely positioned?
[10:49:19] <bberry> if you have a position:absoluted element without defining anything like top or left or whatever, does it default to top: 0 left: 0?
[10:49:30] <Velveeta> princestolas: can you use a jsonp request of type post?
[10:49:43] <Velveeta> bberry: i think so, yes
[10:51:39] <BillCriswell> Jesus chris.
[10:51:41] <BillCriswell> I hate websites.

[10:52:08] <Velveeta> can we please just flash all the things?
[10:52:16] <DagMoller> margin: "0px auto" wont work
[10:52:31] <duch_kazatel> DagMoller what's up with the extra quotes?
[10:52:55] <BillCriswell> DonVitoCorleone: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[10:53:03] <DagMoller> duch_kazatel, sorry, self.dialog.css({margin: "0px auto"});
[10:53:11] <bberry> remind me again, does .toggle change the visibility or the display
[10:53:27] <Fexco`> ghost_priest?
[10:53:37] <Velveeta> bberry: display
[10:53:38] <bberry> wait, jquery.com is probably up by now haha. nvm!

[10:56:16] <Merv> NVM
[10:56:28] <Velveeta> somebody in our internal FEE skype chat the other day said some company waited too long to start trying to compete with the existing technology, and my response was "it's never too late to try to compete.. i'm still waiting on the dreamcast64"
[10:56:42] <duch_kazatel> geniuses all around
[10:56:47] <ophi491> does anyone having experience using promises with chrome.storage api when creating extensions?
[10:57:09] <Velveeta> ophi491: are you talking about jquery promises or the native promise api?
[10:57:21] <ophi491> jquery deferred
[10:57:48] <Velveeta> i've never used them in the context of that storage api, but i've used the hell out of promises in general, do you have a question about something specific?
[10:57:54] <Merv> dreamcast64 has several really good games... and then many many bad ones.
[10:58:14] <Merv> native promise?
[10:58:15] <Merv> I have used the hell out of promise
[10:58:42] <BillCriswell> I promise a lot of things I never follow up on.
[10:58:44] <Velveeta> by native promise i meant the actual vanilla js promise spec
[10:59:11] <Velveeta> bill is guilty of always returning promises and never resolving or rejecting them...
[10:59:27] <ophi491> I am trying to setInterval to get data every three seconds, but i want to wait for when the async methods from the .storage api are done & resolved
[11:00:15] <ophi491> The setInterval file is sandboxed so I post message to the main file the data, store sort and display the  data, then I want to execute the setInterval process again
[11:00:19] <Merv> Vanilla promise? I guess I assume the browser support is not broad enough for them.
[11:00:21] <Velveeta> ophi491: are you managing the promises for the storage api, or does it use its own promise object?
[11:00:34] <ophi491> I am managing it, well I will be
[11:00:40] <Velveeta> merv: no, browser support is most definitely not broad enough on those yet, so i'm sticking w/ jquery promises for now ;)
[11:01:18] <Merv> Thought I missed something and was excited!  For but one moment.
[11:01:54] <Merv> I wrote my own for one application rather than pushing it onto the event loop queue and having to compete with other events.
[11:02:18] <Velveeta> ophi491: well, one thing i could suggest would be that anytime a write operation is sent to the storage api, and you spawn up a new deferred object to manage the state of that operation, you can push it onto an array, and at the time your setInterval callback fires, if that array.length > 0, make a call to $.when.apply(this, yourArray) and execute the get operation when they're all completed
[11:02:51] <Merv> jquery to my knowledge still pushes things to the event loop which can be problematic for really promise deferral heavy apps; well in theory
[11:03:06] <Velveeta> merv: looks like they're supported in later versions of FF and chrome, but not in IE or safari yet: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
[11:03:26] <Merv> Seems reasonable
[11:03:56] <Velveeta> as far as i know, jquery deferreds use more of a signaling type of pattern vs event-driven, if that's what you're talking about
[11:05:13] <Velveeta> ophi491: i would also probably use setTimeout vs setInterval, so you don't start getting a queue backup if there are a lot of write operations
[11:05:48] <ophi491> Velveeta, Thank you that is a good Idea. The only problem I facing is that the getInterval file can only communicate with postMessage
[11:06:09] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what that means
[11:06:26] <Velveeta> but reading the mdn page on it right now
[11:07:08] <ophi491> I don't have direct access to anything from the other files, to communicate you postMessage and on the other end it receives the message and you can determine what to do
[11:07:51] <ophi491> So i think I can have a postMessage inside the setInterval asking if everything is resolved, and then wait to execute until it receives the message
[11:08:31] <Velveeta> well there's always the potential for write operations to be going on, so this would just be an iterative fetching of your data.... but it looks like postMessage supports passing a data object, so could you just issue a fetch request, and on the other end, monitor your promises, and when they're done, do the fetch and pass it back with the postMessage?
[11:09:23] <Velveeta> this postMessage thing looks a lot like what firebase.io is set up for doing
[11:09:47] <ophi491> Yes thank you I think that will work, i am just struggling trying to get everything to communicate properly
[11:09:54] <ophi491> what is firebase?
[11:10:05] <RandalSchwartz> JSON-based message bus
[11:10:11] <Velveeta> you should check it out, it's got some pretty impressive demo's... it's billed as "3-way data binding"
[11:10:22] <Velveeta> i haven't used it myself yet, but it definitely looks interesting
[11:11:03] <Velveeta> sort of 2-way data binding plus socket functionality to automatically sync data with the server also
[11:11:20] <ophi491> are the methods asynchronous?
[11:11:29] <Velveeta> yep
[11:11:48] <ophi491> the main thing that is messing me up is the async methods but i guess i have to get use to them
[11:12:39] <Velveeta> you set up event listeners for when data is received from the server, and update your models accordingly, which update their view components in turn... any data needing to be persisted is posted back to the server, which then broadcasts it out to all other clients interested in that data, which in turn sync their models also, so you wind up with multi-client view/model syncing w/ the persistent layer being within a mongodb
[11:13:33] <Velveeta> yeah, wrapping your head around async development patterns is one of the hurdles of good js development, but once you do, it gets to be a lot more of a natural way to program.. you just have to realize that synchronous execution can't be trusted as often as you'd like
[11:13:47] <ophi491> That sounds very useful
[11:14:00] <Velveeta> i'm currently in the process of rewriting our jquery ui components to be 100% promise-based, and use requestAnimationFrame for their UI updates
[11:14:28] <Velveeta> it means we lose the ease of traditional chaining, but can still accomplish that through promise chaining anyway, so only a small refactor for the consumers
[11:15:08] <ophi491> What are the downsides of synchronous execution? everything was so much easier before i had to use async methods lol
[11:15:24] <RandalSchwartz> threads suck :)
[11:15:24] <duch_kazatel> what happens when an operation never completes?
[11:15:26] <Velveeta> so instead of doing something like this now: $(something).dataloader('reload').dataloader('render'); we'd do something like this instead: $(something).dataloader('reload').done(function () { $(this).dataloader('render'); });
[11:15:38] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel++
[11:15:41] <duch_kazatel> ophi491 also, it separates your logic even better.,
[11:15:55] <RandalSchwartz> I'm really liking how promises are baked into Dart
[11:16:01] <Fexco`> All your jquery are belong to us!
[11:16:07] <Velveeta> right, it makes for easier testability also, because a common pattern for async dev is through event messaging, which you can simulate anytime
[11:16:25] <Velveeta> but it also makes efficient use of your processor time
[11:16:32] <ophi491> ok thank you everyone I am going to try to make this work
[11:16:39] <duch_kazatel> modularization of containers is all well and good, but people tend to forget that you can also modularize your logic.
[11:16:55] <Velveeta> not everything requires being waited on for completion... just queue something to run asynchronously, switch to another task, and be alerted when the first one completes, to be able to pick back up on it
[11:16:55] <duch_kazatel> and do better abstraction.
[11:17:01] <shoky> and may the schwartz be with you
[11:17:11] <Velveeta> yogurt!
[11:17:21] <shoky> strawberry!
[11:17:33] <duch_kazatel> basically, promises/deferreds are an awesome concept and if you disagree you can get outta my face
[11:17:40] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:17:43] <shoky> ;D
[11:17:58] <duch_kazatel> #jquery
[11:18:27] <ophi491> How do you store persistent data like keeping track of promises? do people use localstorage?
[11:18:36] <duch_kazatel> define "persistent"
[11:18:46] <Velveeta> it took me a little while to wrap my head around promises, and then when i did, i only saw a narrowly-focused usage for them, regarding mostly ajax types of transactions... when i broke that mental model and started using them for all kinds of other traditionally synchronous operations, i started getting tons of mileage out of them
[11:19:20] <ophi491> well not persistent just an array for promise statuses
[11:19:37] <Velveeta> yeah i just push them onto an array if i'm tracking a list of them
[11:19:38] <duch_kazatel> ophi491 no need for localstorage if it's during the same session imo.
[11:20:26] <ophi491> are globalvariables acceptable in javascript?
[11:20:47] <ophi491> i am so used to being shamed for using them
[11:20:49] <Velveeta> they're acceptable as in they're part of the language... but they're typically considered bad practice
[11:21:04] <Velveeta> except in cases of maybe library references like jQuery or Handlebars or something
[11:21:16] <Velveeta> and then then, if you can inject them into a code module as a local reference, that's the preferred method
[11:22:30] <ophi491> ok I was thinking the array you used for promise statuses would go out of scope
[11:22:41] <ophi491> but not if you write it properly
[11:22:46] <Velveeta> exactly ;)
[11:23:25] <duch_kazatel> IIFEs are a thing and nice.
[11:23:34] <Velveeta> and a thing
[11:24:51] <BillCriswell> A very thing.
[11:25:16] <duch_kazatel> such thing.  so structure.  wow.
[11:25:17] <shoky> much iife, such thing
[11:25:24] <shoky> !
[11:25:33] <duch_kazatel> shoky++
[11:25:34] <Velveeta> $(doge).hide()
[11:25:36] <ophi491> Yeah I jumped into writing the extension too quickly I didnt realize javascript scope had so many options
[11:25:57] <duch_kazatel> ophi491 how long have you been working with JS?
[11:26:25] <Velveeta> ophi491: js has matured a lot in the last few years... it's actually getting to be a big-boy language now, with all kinds of considerations to be made :)
[11:26:57] <ophi491> duch_kazatel I think 5 days now whenever I came here and asked you that question about CORS lol
[11:27:01] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:27:05] <duch_kazatel> well shoot.
[11:27:09] <ophi491> Velveeta it seems very powerful
[11:27:22] <Velveeta> it totally is, and i love that it's spread to the server now also
[11:27:30] <hcker2000> is there any reason you cant do some thing like jQuery(partial html doc).find('button');
[11:27:41] <duch_kazatel> well, to the server in a better way than rhino
[11:27:45] <duch_kazatel> *shudder*
[11:27:53] <Velveeta> hcker2000: that should be valid, so long as the button isn't the top-level element
[11:28:11] <hcker2000> it is not it is hidden though and for some reason its not finding it
[11:28:22] <duch_kazatel> hcker2000 define "hidden"
[11:28:33] <Velveeta> hcker2000: can you throw together a jsfiddle demo of what you're trying to do?
[11:29:03] <hcker2000> hidden as in display: none;
[11:29:16] <hcker2000> Velveeta, maybe though it will take a while
[11:29:22] <Velveeta> no problem
[11:29:27] <duch_kazatel> hcker2000 http://jsfiddle.net/An38p/
[11:29:29] <Velveeta> the display none shouldn't matter to the find function
[11:29:32] <duch_kazatel> should be fine.
[11:29:49] <hcker2000> yea i wouldent think so let me try and paste bin some dump so you can see what i have going that will be quicker
[11:29:56] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it please.
[11:29:59] <Velveeta> right
[11:30:30] <Velveeta> i read one RHPS tweet earlier, and find myself now having to listen to the soundtrack
[11:30:38] <hcker2000> http://pastebin.com/7XQGMVkN
[11:30:41] <hcker2000> thats the first level
[11:30:55] <Velveeta> jsfiddle it please...
[11:30:59] <duch_kazatel> hcker2000 can't help you with that.
[11:31:21] <hcker2000> http://pastebin.com/3wZdkfst
[11:31:27] <Velveeta> dude..
[11:31:32] <hcker2000> alright let me see what i can do
[11:31:37] <hcker2000> its just a pain in the butt
[11:31:43] <duch_kazatel> copy -> paste
[11:31:52] <Velveeta> it's even more of a pain in the butt for us to try to debug something that isn't interactive
[11:32:23] <Velveeta> and we need to see what that content property actually holds, not just that object reference
[11:33:28] <hcker2000> as http://jsbin.com/bokugapi/1/edit
[11:33:51] <hcker2000> for some reason its hiding the map though after its constructed which dosnt happen on mine
[11:34:29] <il> How can I use .after() to insert data inside a table cell? Right now it is inserting data to the cell to the right of it
[11:34:47] <hcker2000> yea it looks to be having issues with jsbin
[11:34:50] <BillCriswell> il: .append()
[11:34:58] <BillCriswell> instead of .after()
[11:35:19] <Velveeta> whoa
[11:35:22] <il> yes, BillCriswell, but i can't attribute styles to .append in my css (which is what i need to do)
[11:35:40] <Velveeta> hcker2000: all we need to see is like a one-line snippet of the markup you're trying to pass to the $() function..
[11:35:41] <BillCriswell> What?
[11:36:32] <il> after is a pseudoelement. you can edit the styles of the ::after of a class in css, like element::after{color:black;}. You can't do that with .append, BillCriswell
[11:37:19] <Velveeta> oh you're trying to target the ::after pseudo-element?
[11:37:22] <Velveeta> that's not possible
[11:37:23] <il> Yea
[11:37:32] <BillCriswell> .after() adds an element after an element, it doesn't add a pseudo element.
[11:37:36] <Velveeta> it doesn't actually exist as part of the dom, there's nothing for jquery to get a handle to
[11:38:44] <hcker2000> Velveeta, http://pastebin.com/RBSCsvfx
[11:39:03] <hcker2000> thats the content I'm wrapping in jQuery()
[11:39:12] <hcker2000> and trying to use .find('button') on
[11:39:17] <Velveeta> hcker2000: that button is one of the top-level elements
[11:39:26] <Velveeta> find only searches children.. those are all top-level siblings
[11:39:32] <Velveeta> so you could try using .filter() instead of .find()
[11:39:42] <Velveeta> or you could wrap the whole thing in a div or something, and then use find
[11:39:43] <duch_kazatel> or wrap your stuff in a single element
[11:40:09] <hcker2000> ahh right right duh my brain assumed some kind of meta wrapper would be created for a root node
[11:40:14] <hcker2000> but thats silly
[11:40:32] <Velveeta> nope, it just creates a document fragment of multiple sibling nodes in that case
[11:41:40] <hcker2000> right on filter worked just fine
[11:41:54] <hcker2000> now console.log(jQuery(marker.infoWindow.content).filter('button')); is showing me the button node
[11:41:55] <Velveeta> sweet
[11:42:23] <BillCriswell> I wish sass has scopes and shit
[11:42:40] <hcker2000> now the only problem is I think thats being applied to the dom before I do my modification
[11:42:58] <hcker2000> as when I do .data('marker') its not a property even though I'm setting it
[11:43:44] <hcker2000> bah now I need to figure out how to create a marker then assigned it an info window which has itself attatched to it
[11:43:51] <Velveeta> so you're setting that data marker property before or after injecting it into the document?
[11:45:37] <hcker2000> Velveeta, it seems like I'm doing it after its injecting it
[11:45:50] <hcker2000> im using maps.js to setup a google map
[11:46:06] <hcker2000> normally you create a marker with info window at the same time
[11:46:11] <hcker2000> I need to create a marker
[11:46:55] <hcker2000> then add an info window with a button that has a data element pointing back to the marker itself for later use
[11:47:12] <hcker2000> as there seems to be no way to look up a marker based on the info window your in
[11:47:28] <Velveeta> i haven't really done any work w/ google maps stuff, so that's probably past my realm of expertise
[11:47:41] <bberry> silly question, and not jquery, how do you center a div vertically
[11:48:08] <hcker2000> Velveeta, no problem I think i have an idea but we will see if it works lol
[11:48:23] <Velveeta> bberry: you can *try* display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;
[11:48:30] <Velveeta> hcker2000: good luck :D
[11:49:00] <bberry> lol
[11:49:02] <hcker2000> Velveeta, yea i just tried no luck
[11:49:13] <bberry> i just did position:absolute; with all top/left/bottom/right as 0
[11:49:18] <Velveeta> bberry: outside of that, i've also seem nested container methods that use things like top: 50% on the outer container, and top: -50% on the inner container
[11:49:19] <bberry> and margin auto
[11:49:26] <bberry> http://jsfiddle.net/CL32n/1/
[11:49:42] <Velveeta> yeah, aside from those options i just threw out there, the only way i could think of would have involved using javascript to position it
[11:50:02] <Velveeta> good to know that worked, though
[11:54:49] <nullp0inter> i am hardcoding a select option as selected. when i use my mouse to select another choice, the DOM doesnt update and my jquery function keeps looking at the one i hardcoded. is there a way to correct this behavior?
[11:57:05] <Velveeta> are you checking by something like $('[selected="selected"]') ?
[11:59:48] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : im doing this: var template_id = $("#master_template_select option:selected").text();
[12:00:16] <nullp0inter> it keeps pulling the value of the hardcoded selected option and not what im selecting with my mouse
[12:00:22] <Velveeta> can we see a jsfiddle demo? just with your select and whatever code you have wired up to whatever event (click/change/whatever)
[12:00:44] <Velveeta> maybe that'd be a better place to start, what event are you wiring that snippet of code to?
[12:00:57] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : couple min ill throw it together
[12:01:03] <Velveeta> ok
[12:03:57] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : http://jsfiddle.net/c32eN/
[12:04:49] <nullp0inter> im hardcoding it as <option..... selected> however when i see the html it shows <option.... selected="">
[12:04:53] <nullp0inter> could that be the problem?
[12:05:35] <Velveeta> that doesn't actually set anything as selected
[12:05:48] <Velveeta> if you're trying to set it as selected using that attribute, it needs to be a nonempty value
[12:05:53] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : so i should hardcode it as selected="selected"
[12:05:54] <nullp0inter> ?
[12:05:59] <Velveeta> typically, people duplicate the attribute name, like that, yes
[12:06:09] <Velveeta> multiple="multiple" selected="selected" checked="checked" etc
[12:06:52] <Velveeta> and make sure if you're programmatically changing that via jquery, that you continue to do it with .prop() like i see you've already done on like 29 of that fiddle
[12:07:06] <Velveeta> that's the preferred function vs .attr()
[12:07:51] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : i was just testing that
[12:08:06] <nullp0inter> when i select an option using my mouse, selected="selected" stays on the one i hardcoded
[12:08:29] <nullp0inter> and jquery keeps reading the value of the originally selected one from the first drop down, i.e. value=3616
[12:08:35] <Velveeta> well, the attribute will definitely stay there, but won't be representative of what the actual dom data is
[12:08:45] <NoiseEee> nullp0inter: $(selectElement).val()
[12:08:47] <Velveeta> let me rewrite this some so it's an actual functional demo
[12:09:10] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : i think it might be working now
[12:09:14] <nullp0inter> im going to test too
[12:09:26] <Velveeta> now that you changed the selected attribute?
[12:11:35] <NoiseEee> nullp0inter: don't go by the 'attribute' of an option, ask the <select> for the current value
[12:11:40] <NoiseEee> and get the text from that.
[12:12:47] <sebastian> noob question: for triggering custom events... do they have some restriction for their name? like including a colon in their:name ?
[12:13:36] <Velveeta> not that i'm aware of
[12:13:49] <sebastian> would this be valid?  $("#search").trigger("searchClicked")
[12:14:00] <Velveeta> yep
[12:14:07] <sebastian> cool, thanks Velveeta
[12:14:13] <Velveeta> no problemo
[12:15:22] <nullp0inter> ok, i think its working fine now, except one thing, the line var template_id = $("#master_template_select option:selected").text(); is returning the option text, but not the value, should i change that to .val() ?
[12:15:56] <Velveeta> if you want the value of the selected option, just do just noiseeee recommended.. $('#master_template_select').val()
[12:16:06] <Velveeta> no need to muck about with figuring out which option is selected
[12:16:31] <nullp0inter> ah ok let me try
[12:16:37] <nullp0inter> <-- jquery first timer
[12:17:43] <Velveeta> no problem, that's what we're here for
[12:25:53] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : if youre still there, the first drop down populates the second one onchange. after i do that with mouse interaction, the drop down loads fine, however when returning the .val() for the second drop down, it keeps giving me the text not the actual value. so i have this line after the second drop down is loaded: $('#'+target_select_id).trigger('change', true); however it seems to still give me the text value
[12:25:57] <_Marcus> When I try to use jQuery 2.1.1 (Compressed version) it says there's an error on line 4: "TypeError: b.body is null". Has anyone else had a similar problem?
[12:26:16] <_Marcus> It also does this for jQuery 2.0.0 (both versions), along with the uncompressed version of 2.1.1
[12:26:37] <Velveeta> nullp0inter: you are specifying actual values in your option tags, right?
[12:27:16] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : its the function loadCustomTemplateSelect from http://jsfiddle.net/c32eN/
[12:27:49] <nullp0inter> oh it looks like i have a type and am assigning an id, not a value
[12:27:50] <nullp0inter> doh
[12:28:07] <Velveeta> right, so if the value is absent, it'll use the text as the value itself
[12:29:03] <nullp0inter> Velveeta : it works, thanks very much for guiding me, you too NoiseEee!
[12:30:02] <Velveeta> no problem, good to hear :)
[12:33:18] <_Marcus> I just realized my error is being caused by "$(document).getHeight();"
[12:33:28] <_Marcus> I mean, $(document).height()
[12:46:07] <ElysiumNet> is there a way to capture keyboard input when selecting an element?
[12:47:12] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: what do you mean
[12:47:36] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: for example I want to hide the input text field in a form, but display what the user types in a span field (styling purposes)
[12:47:39] <ElysiumNet> *span element
[12:47:58] <RandalSchwartz> I think you can respond to .on('keydown' ...)
[12:48:00] <ElysiumNet> the reason I need to do this is because chrome is being annoying
[12:48:06] <ElysiumNet> RandalSchwartz: nope
[12:48:08] <RandalSchwartz> or is it keypress
[12:48:19] <ElysiumNet> RandalSchwartz: the span element is the only thing visible to the user
[12:48:23] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: perhaps its 'annoying' to you, but surely expected behaviour
[12:48:36] <duch_kazatel> what is chrome doing that's "annoying"?
[12:48:36] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: then how does the user know where they;re typing/make corrections/etc
[12:48:48] <RandalSchwartz> keypress is only when inserted, might not apply to span
[12:48:51] <RandalSchwartz> have you tried keydown?
[12:48:55] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: no, it's annoying as in it will scroll the background of the input field
[12:49:02] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: sounds like you might be after contentEditable on the particular <span>
[12:49:05] <ElysiumNet> and the caret will appear outside the intended zone if I make it wider than the background image
[12:49:14] <ElysiumNet> contentEditable unfortunately isn't supported in IE7
[12:49:17] <ElysiumNet> er, 8
[12:49:28] <ElysiumNet> RandalSchwartz: I've tried all events
[12:49:34] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: sure it is
[12:49:44] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: since what IE version
[12:49:53] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable says 5.5
[12:49:58] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/tests/keys.html
[12:50:08] <NoiseEee> ie: its how those crappy things like rich text editors work
[12:50:37] <frozenyogurt> hey so im trying to fade in a navbar color
[12:50:41] <ElysiumNet> RandalSchwartz: then I'm confused why .bind() any of those doesn't work
[12:50:44] <frozenyogurt> 				    $('#home_nav').stop().animate({ 					          backgroundColor: $(window).scrollTop() > 450 ? 'rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.95)' : 'transparent' 					        }, 300);
[12:50:46] <frozenyogurt> like so
[12:50:51] <RandalSchwartz> .bind?  not .on?
[12:50:52] <frozenyogurt> but i dont want the stop
[12:50:56] <RandalSchwartz> .on is the new .bind :)
[12:50:57] <NoiseEee> frozenyogurt: colours don't animate
[12:50:58] <ElysiumNet> D'OH
[12:51:10] <duch_kazatel> ElysiumNet also http://www.gwtproject.org/ this might be of use to you.
[12:51:13] <frozenyogurt> do you know a better way to do this?
[12:51:25] <frozenyogurt> NoiseEee: a better solution?
[12:51:29] <NoiseEee> frozenyogurt: i think using https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color makes it work
[12:51:45] <duch_kazatel> wait nvm ignore gwt
[12:51:46] <Velveeta> frozenyogurt: apply those color properties to some css rules, and make a transition on the opacity as you switch from one class to another maybe?
[12:51:48] <rindolf> RandalSchwartz: hi, I didn't know you were here.
[12:52:10] <ElysiumNet> 1.11.1 supports .on() right?
[12:52:18] <frozenyogurt> velveeta
[12:52:22] <RandalSchwartz> I believe introduced 1.7
[12:52:22] <frozenyogurt> good thinking
[12:52:25] <frozenyogurt> will try
[12:52:28] <duch_kazatel> ElysiumNet yep.
[12:52:30] <frozenyogurt> NoiseEee: dont wanna use node
[12:52:36] <Velveeta> and then you get a pure css solution also
[12:52:37] <frozenyogurt> NoiseEee: thanks though
[12:52:43] <NoiseEee> frozenyogurt: nothing to do with node, its a plugin for jquery
[12:53:07] <NoiseEee> frozenyogurt: its mentioned on http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:53:14] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - added 1.7 - http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:53:37] <RandalSchwartz> ... As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document.
[12:53:39] <Velveeta> i think those node instructions are just for obtaining the src if you want to work on the project itself
[12:54:15] <ElysiumNet> $(document).on('keypress keydown keyup', 'span.code-input', function(event) { doesn't seem to be reacting...
[12:54:31] <RandalSchwartz> whuh?
[12:54:32] <ElysiumNet> it does react to clicking
[12:54:38] <RandalSchwartz> $('span.code-input').on(...)
[12:54:40] <duch_kazatel> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[12:54:42] <RandalSchwartz> you have args backwards
[12:54:47] <ElysiumNet> RandalSchwartz: no, I don't
[12:54:48] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: i thought the user was typing into an input, not a span, or did you use content-editable?
[12:54:50] <duch_kazatel> RandalSchwartz no he doesn't.  that's the delegated syntax.
[12:54:59] <RandalSchwartz> oh - never seen that before
[12:55:06] <ElysiumNet> RandalSchwartz: it's on the page you linked :P
[12:55:07] <duch_kazatel> ElysiumNet use contenteditable and call it a day.
[12:55:27] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - just never seen. :)
[12:55:28] <ElysiumNet> duch_kazatel: I'll end up with the caret, which I'm not allowed to have
[12:55:38] <phelix> hey duch_kazatel: I got your code working properly. that you showed me the other day. This is waay better than how I had it lol.. But now how do I go about getting the values from each individual slider? http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/20/
[12:55:57] <duch_kazatel> ElysiumNet could you show us exactly what you're trying to do?
[12:56:23] <Velveeta> as far as i know, spans don't emit key events, unless possibly under contenteditable mode
[12:56:27] <thebope> phelix, that looks really nice
[12:56:36] <thebope> Is there an api? Going over that would be my best bet
[12:56:42] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: i thought the user was typing into an input, not a span
[12:56:46] <thebope> there's probably a sliderValue type call you can use
[12:57:05] <duch_kazatel> .val() on the slider element.
[12:57:05] <Velveeta> what if you put a text input inside your span, and removed its border and made its background transparent, and styled the span?
[12:57:16] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: into a span, chrome prevents typing into a hidden input field
[12:57:32] <phelix> thebope: no api. just using built in jquery functions
[12:58:29] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: get this... .on() won't work on a span unless it has an tabindex attribute
[12:58:38] <ElysiumNet> otherwise it's document and window that receive the keypress
[12:58:41] <duch_kazatel> phelix could you clarify your question?>
[12:58:53] <phelix> duch_kazatel: But now there is only 1 slider event for all the items. How can I get a seperate value for each slider?
[12:59:15] <duch_kazatel> phelix no, there's one handler for all events.
[12:59:19] <duch_kazatel> big difference.
[12:59:43] <phelix> I need to get a value for each slider. As I have to create some forumals with each individual slider and then populate that value in other fields in live time
[13:00:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix okay - so how would i apply what i showed you here to do that?
[13:00:13] <duch_kazatel> *would you apply
[13:00:49] <frozenyogurt> NoiseEee: so how would i change the color
[13:00:52] <frozenyogurt> i dont see it in the docs
[13:00:56] <phelix> I would need a function for each different slider I would imagine. I'm a php guy. Its hard looking at code in another way
[13:00:57] <frozenyogurt> or im just very confused
[13:01:06] <ElysiumNet> but then I can't use backspace... argh!
[13:01:29] <duch_kazatel> phelix because you could add more logic to that callback in the slide config option to handle that, or your could bind a listener to the inputs that triggers on change...
[13:01:32] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.
[13:01:47] <phelix> ahh ok
[13:01:49] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: thats wrong http://jsfiddle.net/7uaCn/
[13:01:51] <frozenyogurt> becuase it seems like they are doing animate as well
[13:02:04] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: i think you need to take a step back or rest or something and come up with a new approach
[13:02:05] <phelix> adding a listener on the inputs sounds good. Let me try this..
[13:02:11] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: I just had my rest
[13:02:16] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: moar rest
[13:02:16] <duch_kazatel> phelix use a delegated listener to handle that, btw.
[13:02:24] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: but the deadline is in 2 hours!
[13:02:27] <phelix> I'll have to google that one lol
[13:02:34] <NoiseEee> frozenyogurt: download the plugin, use it, and animate will work with your colour change
[13:03:18] <ElysiumNet> http://i.imgur.com/AXdMeiv.png this is basically what I am trying to fake
[13:03:18] <socialblogsite> phelix: find some animate(… function in the slider, and add to the callback a few lines to add classes to the element sliding, like “moving” or “gone” or “entering” or “leaving”
[13:03:20] <Velveeta> elysiumnet: if your deadline is in 2 hours, here's what you do... go to whoever is demanding this and tell them "it's not feasible... i've consulted with the highest mucky-mucks of the intarwebz, and they said to just use a text input or a contenteditable span"
[13:03:45] <ElysiumNet> and the background is not allowed to scroll horizontally
[13:03:51] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite huh?
[13:04:01] <socialblogsite> phelix: then you can transition each element in the slider depending on the combination of classes of the parent element ;)
[13:04:15] <phelix> hmm, sounds complicated lol
[13:04:22] <socialblogsite> see gallantfish.com for an example
[13:04:24] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: can't you just style your inputs to look like that?
[13:04:26] <phelix> at least for a jquery newbie like me
[13:04:31] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite what in the world are you suggesting?
[13:04:35] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: and the background is not allowed to scroll horizontally
[13:04:37] <phelix> i['ll check that site out
[13:04:46] <duch_kazatel> aaah, how to get/set the sliders.
[13:04:48] <ElysiumNet> chrome and firefox make it a point to scroll the background
[13:04:52] <socialblogsite> you will find the simple addClass() functions in the slider js
[13:05:01] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: but those are essentially 8 inputs?
[13:05:02] <ElysiumNet> "maxlength 8? naaah, let's put the caret at the end for a 9th character"
[13:05:05] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: yes
[13:05:11] <socialblogsite> http://gallantfish.com
[13:05:14] <NoiseEee> so can't you style 8 <input>s?
[13:05:20] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: I would rather not
[13:05:26] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: its wayyyyy less hacky
[13:05:40] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: it's actually more hacky as the underlying script that takes the data has to be modified
[13:05:41] <socialblogsite> phelix: all the animations in that slider are made by simple css transitions
[13:06:08] <ElysiumNet> which I do not have access to
[13:06:12] <socialblogsite> phelix: ony triggered by the class of the parent. (.entering, .leaving…)
[13:06:17] <frozenyogurt> 					$('#home_nav').animate({ 					  backgroundColor: $(window).scrollTop() > 0 ? 'rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.95)' : 'transparent' 					});	
[13:06:17] <ElysiumNet> and using a proxy script is even more hacky
[13:06:19] <phelix> socialblogsite: Nice, I like that. I have made a few css slideshows
[13:06:20] <frozenyogurt> ok
[13:06:21] <frozenyogurt> installed
[13:06:37] <frozenyogurt> but it still doesnt go back to transparent
[13:06:46] <cyclick> Is there an official release of jquery with only ajax, ajax/xhr, core and selector modules? (I don't have grunt)
[13:06:58] <duch_kazatel> cyclick nope.  you'd have to build it yourself.
[13:07:03] <Velveeta> elysiumnet: what do you mean chrome and FF make it a point to scroll the background? horizontally? vertically? as you type? with document scroll?
[13:07:18] <frozenyogurt> NoiseEee: works with stop
[13:07:20] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: horizontally
[13:07:23] <ElysiumNet> as you type
[13:07:25] <frozenyogurt> but still not without
[13:07:30] <Velveeta> cyclick: you can get it all parted out as of 1.11 i believe, and just include the modules you need
[13:07:31] <cyclick> duch_kazatel: thanks
[13:07:35] <socialblogsite> phelix: thanks. Just one tip: You need to set the first animation in JQ, because the won’t trigger automatically.  or using other tricks like adding a class to the body onload, so transitions start ;)
[13:07:38] <duch_kazatel> cyclick there might be tools out there that let you do it, though
[13:08:14] <Velveeta> elysiumnet: are you making it wide enough to support the full length of that image? and adjusting the letter spacing so the characters are centered in those background image tiles?
[13:08:19] <socialblogsite> phelix: you can use my website’s slider. It’s already hacked, but your code needs to match mine (the script’s requirement)
[13:08:35] <Velveeta> and i saw mention up above of maxlength, can you not use that?
[13:08:36] <phelix> socialblogsite: Thats awesome, I love the CSS techniques. I've done some pretty snazzy CSS stuff. I love transitions. That stuff is cool though. I'll def reference this site sometime
[13:08:47] <cyclick> Velveeta: I was reading this https://github.com/jquery/jquery#how-to-build-your-own-jquery and trying to avoid installing grunt and it's dependencies
[13:08:57] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: yes
[13:09:11] <Velveeta> cyclick: is there a reason you're trying to avoid installing grunt and its dependencies?
[13:09:18] <ElysiumNet> the problem is when you enter the 8th character, chrome will move the background so you can enter the 9th character which I don't want it to do
[13:09:18] <phelix> socialblogsite: You have a different type of a slider than I am using though. For this I am  not using a slideshow I am using an actual sliding bar to auto fill an input field
[13:09:49] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: even if you put a hard limit on the input itself? ie: maxlength
[13:10:00] <Velveeta> elysiumnet: can you not make the input wide enough to support 9 characters, to prevent that scrolling?
[13:10:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:10:44] <NoiseEee> <input maxlength='8'>
[13:10:44] <duch_kazatel> phelix ++
[13:10:47] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: no
[13:10:54] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/Shtry/
[13:11:16] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite are you talking about carousels?
[13:11:50] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I beleive so. I have noticed some people call them sliders
[13:11:59] <socialblogsite> slider/carousel? what’s the difference?
[13:12:07] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite one is an input control.
[13:12:12] <cyclick> Velveeta: no huge reason, I was just trying to avoid it (but I don't have virtualbox setup yet and the packages are not easily accessible on my current distribution)
[13:12:14] <duch_kazatel> the other is a way to cycle through images.
[13:12:21] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite you're talking about carousels, not sliders.
[13:12:35] <duch_kazatel> well, images/content.
[13:13:04] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: NoiseEee: that was the first thing I did until I noticed thatr
[13:13:16] <ElysiumNet> then I went onto the span/hide input path
[13:14:03] <ElysiumNet> wrapping it in another element that would hide the end also doesn't work
[13:14:15] <Velveeta> cyclick: you shouldn't need virtualbox set up to use node/grunt, it has releases for *nix and windows platforms... i highly recommend them though, they're uber useful for a variety of things
[13:14:28] <ElysiumNet> even if I made the input wider than it should be
[13:16:28] <NoiseEee> ElysiumNet: these inputs change in length or are always 8?
[13:17:17] <Velveeta> elysium: this is pretty close to what you're looking for, except for the caret: http://jsfiddle.net/Shtry/1/
[13:17:49] <ElysiumNet> NoiseEee: it could be 8, it could be 9
[13:18:03] <Velveeta> but there's not gonna be any way to stop that caret from appearing in the next cursor position, as that's just how the native element works.. you type a character, it moves to the next space
[13:18:03] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: yeah, which is what I'm trying not to have :/
[13:24:38] <Velveeta> this is as close as i could get it, with a keyup listener that checked the maxlength attribute and auto-blurred the field when they match.. and that's an ugly solution.. http://jsfiddle.net/Shtry/2/
[13:24:59] <NoiseEee> Velveeta: ha i was just working on the same thing
[13:25:10] <Velveeta> this would be where i'd tell my boss it ain't gonna happen because it's just not feasible to get all of those requirements playing nicely together
[13:25:23] <duch_kazatel> especially when you only have 2 hours
[13:25:25] <Velveeta> you still see the cursor for an instant before the field blurs, so it's not much better than it already was
[13:25:31] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: right
[13:25:32] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Something like so? http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/23/
[13:25:49] <duch_kazatel> this is the kind of project I would have said "nope" to.
[13:25:53] <Velveeta> noiseeee: good to know i wasn't going down an idiotic track with that line of thinking :D
[13:26:20] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/jyW2jDn.gif
[13:26:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix interesting.  looks like there's something else going on.  Shadow Dom i'll bet.  you'll need to do it in the slide callback.
[13:27:38] <phelix> yeah, it doesn't seem this listener notices when that input is changed or altered as its being populated by other jquery?
[13:28:08] <duch_kazatel> phelix nope, just a shadow dom thing.
[13:28:16] <duch_kazatel> "other" code doesn't really matter that way.
[13:28:27] <phelix> ahh, yah I ran into shadow dom crap last time I tried doing something like this. can't remember how I fixed it
[13:28:46] <duch_kazatel> just put your callback in the predetermined spot for it.
[13:28:53] <phelix> so i can I just put that same function inside here:  slide: function(event, ui) { ?
[13:29:02] <duch_kazatel> yep.  you all ready have one in ther.e
[13:29:19] <phelix> so I can remove the on change stuff?
[13:29:24] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:29:25] <phelix> since there already that event in there?
[13:29:33] <duch_kazatel> *callback, yes.
[13:31:57] <phelix> hmm seems im stumped. on getting a value in here. Even if I do get it to print a value with console.log I still am not going to be able to get a seperate variable for each slider
[13:32:25] <duch_kazatel> phelix there are a few ways to do it.  .each() is your friend here.
[13:32:39] <duch_kazatel> you'll want to cache everything up front, but it's doable.
[13:33:16] <phelix> Will I be able to do it all in live time though. This thing needs to be tottally universal as to if so many items are going to relate to so many other items and changing one element is going to have to update and change many others.
[13:33:42] <duch_kazatel> this is why i recommended something like backbone or riot yesterday.
[13:33:59] <duch_kazatel> but yes, you can do it all in "live time".
[13:34:11] <phelix> any idea how lol
[13:34:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest checking out the docs for .each() and seeing how it can apply here.
[13:35:55] <duch_kazatel> basically, on change, you need to get the value of each slider, and then run your calculations.
[13:36:47] <phelix> but if this is shadow dom will I be able to get these values from the each function?
[13:37:16] <duch_kazatel> you're using the vanilla Slider for JQUI
[13:37:19] <duch_kazatel> right?
[13:37:23] <phelix> I beleive so yes
[13:37:31] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#method-value
[13:41:13] <phelix> uggh. I still can't even figure out how to get a dang value
[13:41:29] <phelix> trying like.      console.log ($(this).slider("value")); in the each function
[13:41:29] <duch_kazatel> really?
[13:41:33] <Woet> I wonder whether anyone has a good idea how to convert http://www.panopta.com/static/bootstrap-wizard-plugin/demo/demo.html into a non-modal wizard (aka, just within the page content like everything else)
[13:41:46] <duch_kazatel> phelix how familiar are you with js / jquery
[13:41:52] <phelix> no ya had me change it up a bit from how this document explains. This is how I had it before, but ya had me move everything into a single each
[13:42:08] <phelix> duch_kazatel: im brand new to this. I know enough to make little changes etc here and there.
[13:42:09] <duch_kazatel> phelix you'll need another each in the change.
[13:42:25] <phelix> But I am trying to learn and I learn best by just digging in and figuring things out
[13:42:44] <duch_kazatel> you should probably hit up learn.jquery.com
[13:42:48] <duch_kazatel> go through that
[13:43:01] <duch_kazatel> Woet not sure what you mean.
[13:43:09] <duch_kazatel> just put the content on the page instead of a modal.
[13:43:23] <Woet> duch_kazatel: I didn't write that script, I'm just trying to convert it to non-modal
[13:43:36] <Woet> i've been playing around with it quite a lot but can't find an easy way to achieve it
[13:43:49] <blindMoe> anyone happen to know of a script that will grab multiple users photos from instagram and combine them into one feed?  Looks like the API only allows searching of one user at a time
[13:44:01] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: NoiseEee: I've succumbed to creating multiple input fields and screwing around with form submit. any tips for moving the caret to the next input field?
[13:44:19] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Well, I don't have time to start going through some tutorials. I got a deadline on this calculator I am developing. I just gotta dig in and figure this crap out
[13:44:34] <duch_kazatel> phelix you've said that a few times in here.
[13:44:35] <Velveeta> elysium: on keyup just do a $(this).next().focus()
[13:44:57] <duch_kazatel> Woet basically, it's all there - just remove the code that makes it a modal.  probably a class or a method that does that.
[13:45:01] <Velveeta> although you'll want to make sure it's a visible character, and rule out any typical non-vis characters like shift, delete, etc, by keycode
[13:45:05] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: yeah, just crossed my mind
[13:45:10] <ElysiumNet> if ( $(this).val().length == $(this).attr('maxlength') ) {
[13:45:14] <Velveeta> which means you'll probably want to use keypress vs keyup, as it's more reliable when it comes to keycodes
[13:45:17] <Woet> duch_kazatel: not that I could find.
[13:45:52] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: you mean keyup?
[13:46:09] <phelix> Cause this is what I do for a living. I just mostly don't get stuck doing jquery stuff. Mostly Drupal/css/php stuff
[13:46:21] <phelix> but every once in awhile I have to get dirty with this crazy jquery
[13:47:24] <duch_kazatel> Woet i'd dump through the JS - looks like the wizard plugin is what does it.
[13:47:25] <ElysiumNet> yech, drupal
[13:47:30] <phelix> that on.change on the input listener doesn't ever seem to get activated as when its updated nothing happens again that prob puts us back to the shadow issue
[13:47:37] <Woet> duch_kazatel: I know, that's what I've been editing for the past hour.
[13:47:45] <phelix> ElysiumNet: Drupal is awesome! :-)
[13:47:46] <duch_kazatel> phelix right - so do it in the slide callback i talked about before.
[13:48:05] <phelix> so I should add a each inside that callback?
[13:48:07] <Velveeta> elysiumnet: keypress, not keyup... keypress is more reliable for the keyCode property than keyup or keydown are
[13:48:12] <duch_kazatel> phelix ... yes.
[13:48:47] <duch_kazatel> phelix tha each will need to get all your data and put it somewhere, then run your logic for your data.
[13:49:21] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: keydown seems to be doing what I need it to do, actually
[13:49:23] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be slow if there are a lot of inputs.
[13:49:29] <duch_kazatel> which is where we'll deal with caching.
[13:49:31] <duch_kazatel> but we'll do that later.
[13:50:14] <Velveeta> elysiumnet: are you checking to see if the key being pressed is say, an arrow key or a shift key or a delete/backspace key?
[13:50:40] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: no, I'm checking for the input value's length
[13:51:08] <Velveeta> so what happens if they want to go back and change a character, and they click into an input and try to highlight the existing one?
[13:51:08] <ElysiumNet> I'll probably need to make a whitelist so space doesn't get in there
[13:51:36] <Velveeta> that counts as a keypress if they use something like shift-right, or control-a or something, which would automatically jump them to the next box
[13:51:37] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: I've added exceptions for those
[13:51:44] <ElysiumNet> for backspace and delete
[13:52:11] <Velveeta> you'll probably want more than just backspace and delete
[13:52:37] <ElysiumNet> I don't think so
[13:52:46] <ElysiumNet> A-Z0-9 is the input I expect
[13:52:53] <duch_kazatel> but not a-z?
[13:52:56] <Velveeta> you care about caret positioning that much, but don't care about usability?
[13:52:57] <ElysiumNet> a-z as well
[13:53:11] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: usability can be put on the burner for now :P
[13:53:16] <Velveeta> aye yai yai
[13:53:22] <ElysiumNet> this is more of a "Look! it's there! now give me more time!"
[13:53:34] <Velveeta> that's some ass-backwards prioritization on the part of whoever you're doing this for
[13:54:12] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: hey, there is a website dedicated to them :P
[13:54:25] <Velveeta> dedicated to who?
[13:54:26] <ElysiumNet> multiple websites
[13:54:30] <ElysiumNet> idiot clients
[13:54:34] <Velveeta> definitely
[13:54:44] <ElysiumNet> notalwaysright, thedailywtf, etc
[13:55:02] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/24/ much closer. not sure why it breaks it on hte fiddle. But I am at least get some type of values now
[13:55:02] <duch_kazatel> i'm so glad i don't have to deal with that world.
[13:55:31] <duch_kazatel> phelix is your console open?
[13:55:37] <phelix> ya
[13:55:37] <ElysiumNet> although thedailywtf deals more with idiot programmers...
[13:55:43] <phelix> I geta ton of crap now though lol
[13:55:55] <duch_kazatel> phelix it doesn't even run for me now.
[13:56:08] <duch_kazatel> semicolons buddy ;)
[13:56:09] <phelix> yea not sure why.. let me see if something is different
[13:56:14] <phelix> ohh i missed one lol
[13:56:28] <duch_kazatel> and take out your on change.
[13:57:53] <phelix> Yea, I am not sure whats going on. But i move one bar and I get like 100 differnt items off all different numbers.
[13:57:58] <phelix> http://calc.tributemedia.com/
[13:58:05] <duch_kazatel> I can't move anything because none of it works now.
[13:58:16] <duch_kazatel> stick to the fiddle for now.
[13:58:36] <phelix> k
[13:58:56] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/27/

[13:59:17] <duch_kazatel> you needed a domReady in there, too.
[13:59:29] <duch_kazatel> but there you go.
[13:59:51] <ElysiumNet> Velveeta: I'll probably use mousetrap.js
[14:00:24] <phelix> your version doesn't look any different than mine
[14:00:38] <duch_kazatel> it's got a semi you're missing and better indentation.
[14:00:54] <Velveeta> o
[14:00:59] <Velveeta> er, stupid home keys
[14:01:03] <Velveeta> i'm not familiar w/ mousetrap
[14:01:26] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can help me with skrollr, please?
[14:01:32] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Forbidd3n
[14:01:32] <b-ot> Forbidd3n: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[14:03:31] <phelix> yah there we go. Seems to be working better now
[14:03:32] <Forbidd3n> I want the menu to affix to the top when it hits the top and I need the image to be 0px from the top of the prev element, in this case header
[14:04:01] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n why are you asking in #jquery about a library that doesn't even use #jQuery?
[14:04:20] <phelix> so to just add some math to some specific items would I just add if statements inside this function here?
[14:04:38] <duch_kazatel> phelix that's the basic gist.
[14:04:40] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: I tried using stellar and was unsuccessful as well. Are you able to help with stellar I would be more than happy to go back to it
[14:04:55] <phelix> basically grabbing the values from $(.this-class) and $(.other-class) etc?
[14:05:00] <phelix> ok
[14:05:25] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n you're much more likely to get help with those if you ask in channel specifically related to them or, at the very least, provide basic fiddle use-cases illustrating your specific question(s)
[14:05:49] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: I gave the actual live link to the page
[14:05:53] <Forbidd3n> no need for fiddle
[14:06:10] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n i'm not going to dump through all of your code ;)
[14:06:20] <phelix> duch likes his fiddle. :)
[14:06:28] <duch_kazatel> i loves me some small test cases.
[14:06:52] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: there isn't much code to look at
[14:07:21] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n oh okay. sorry for trying to help you get assistance :)
[14:07:49] <guzzlefry> if a child element is added or removed to/from the parent, does that trigger the onchange event for the parent?
[14:07:59] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry nope.
[14:08:04] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry change is for inputs.
[14:08:20] <guzzlefry> Ah, what am I looking for?
[14:08:34] <duch_kazatel> mutationobserver, but be warned that they are SLOWWWWWWW
[14:10:16] <guzzlefry> DOMNodeInserted/DOMNodeRemoved?
[14:10:17] <duch_kazatel> slow enough that you should avoid using them basically always.  if your problem is remediated by using them, you should probably reconsider everything you're doing.
[14:10:40] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Trying to figure out how to do the login with this.. say I want to add the values of 2 different input values that have a different class for them. would oyu mind showing me a quick example?
[14:10:47] <socialblogsite> ohhh, slider :P sorry.
[14:11:10] <duch_kazatel> phelix store them in an array and go to town afterwards.
[14:11:20] <socialblogsite> range input! :$
[14:11:43] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite "slider" is the control we're talking about.  "carousel" is the better term for what you're talking about.
[14:11:55] <phelix> duch_kazatel: ahh ok
[14:14:13] <socialblogsite> in my world “range” is the best term for what you are referring. Is jQuery calling different when targeting them?
[14:14:43] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite the plugins are almost all called "slider" for that control these days.
[14:14:46] <duch_kazatel> jqueryui calls them sliders.
[14:14:50] <socialblogsite> duch_kazatel: I’ll keep it in mind, though. Excuse my bad english
[14:15:51] <socialblogsite> slider = control. Carousel = marquee. Correct?
[14:16:02] <Velveeta> right
[14:16:04] <Velveeta> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[14:16:08] <duch_kazatel> be carefuly with the "marquee" word, but basically.
[14:16:15] <duch_kazatel> marquee used to be an actual element.
[14:16:41] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/
[14:16:47] <socialblogsite> right. marquee is to carousel what range is to slider (html)
[14:17:07] <duch_kazatel> "slideshow" sure.
[14:17:10] <duch_kazatel> just not "slider"
[14:17:27] <socialblogsite> but slideshow could be fading, and carousel should be moving
[14:17:44] <socialblogsite> kk
[14:17:47] <socialblogsite> noted :)
[14:18:04] <duch_kazatel> "carousel" is the generally accepted name.
[14:18:08] <duch_kazatel> they can have effects on them.
[14:18:17] <duch_kazatel> "slideshow" is another term for them.
[14:18:32] <RandalSchwartz> $client used what I pasted for a banner rotator
[14:18:44] <duch_kazatel> $client?
[14:18:58] <RandalSchwartz> yes... "unnamed client" like a shell variable
[14:19:01] <duch_kazatel> oh, a client.
[14:19:05] <duch_kazatel> clever
[14:19:06] <RandalSchwartz> standard IRC talk
[14:19:11] <socialblogsite> Does anybody know a JS shortcode parser into array? (atts and content, etc)
[14:19:42] <RandalSchwartz> I didn't invent it.
[14:19:47] <RandalSchwartz> was amused the first time I saw it though
[14:19:54] <RandalSchwartz> like "good $timeofday"
[14:20:05] <duch_kazatel> i'm not saying you did :)
[14:21:30] <phelix> valArray.push($ (test).val()); is this close to how to create an array with jquery lol
[14:21:48] <duch_kazatel> don't create an array with jquery.
[14:21:56] <duch_kazatel> var myArray = [];
[14:22:05] <duch_kazatel> myArray.push() to add your new values.
[14:22:12] <phelix> well that will make it empty
[14:22:13] <duch_kazatel> i'll bake up a quick example./
[14:22:19] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:22:23] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[14:24:06] <duch_kazatel> this could be greatly improved upon - very hacky, but it gets the idea accross: http://jsfiddle.net/LeqNB/
[14:24:47] <phelix> wow, they don't make creating arrays so easy in jquery
[14:24:55] <duch_kazatel> what are you talking about.
[14:25:01] <duch_kazatel> jQuery does "create arrays"
[14:25:11] <duch_kazatel> that's a javascript thing.
[14:25:14] <duch_kazatel> *doesn't
[14:25:34] <phelix> php inside that loop would be as easy as $item[] = $test.val();
[14:25:37] <phelix> if you could merge the 2 lol
[14:26:31] <duch_kazatel> and actually: http://jsfiddle.net/LeqNB/1/
[14:26:38] <duch_kazatel> that array doesn't need to be outside that logtic.
[14:26:57] <phelix> hmm, trying to figure out how in the world I'm gonna apply this to what I've got lol
[14:27:56] <duch_kazatel> almost everything but that keyup is applicable...
[14:28:25] <phelix> Wont all this need to be inside my each function?
[14:28:40] <duch_kazatel> Did You Try?(tm)
[14:28:59] <phelix> getting ready to. Trying to make sense of this first.
[14:29:08] <duch_kazatel> okay - let's help you understand then.
[14:29:40] <duch_kazatel> what are you stuck on?
[14:30:39] <phelix> Well first.. I can just create a var $theInpuits = $('input');
[14:30:54] <duch_kazatel> that's just caching that selector, bu okay.
[14:30:55] <duch_kazatel> *but
[14:31:08] <phelix> this just sets $theInputs to be $('input') so I don't have to keep declaring thatevery time right?
[14:31:29] <duch_kazatel> that also makes things more efficient but not rerunning that lookup every time.
[14:31:36] <duch_kazatel> doing that is slow and inefficient.
[14:31:44] <duch_kazatel> cache it instead.
[14:32:22] <phelix> can I change it to like input.slider-input ? so that it only targets the inputs that are related with the slider?
[14:32:42] <krambiorix> how can i bind 2 actions on one element ? I try $("body").on('change,focusout','.input-mine',function(){
[14:33:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix huh?  aren't you trying to add together ALL the values?
[14:33:20] <duch_kazatel> .on('change focusout',
[14:33:23] <phelix> duch_kazatel: No, only specific items will be added together
[14:33:32] <tenoke> eh, does it actually run the query separately every time, if you don't declare it there. I assumed they both work as pointer to the same value.
[14:33:34] <duch_kazatel> phelix for each slider?
[14:33:44] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: here is a simple test case - first issue is the nav when scrolling doesn't go 100% of the parent, secondly, the image I need to be top: 0 of previous element and I am using 130px on background-position but it leaves a whitespace on scroll - http://jsfiddle.net/BL7ce/
[14:33:46] <phelix> like slider 1+ slider2 * slider4 / slider5 etc
[14:33:53] <phelix> and that will populate inpux X
[14:34:00] <phelix> and there will be like 30 of these
[14:34:01] <duch_kazatel> tenoke nope.  calling $() runs the constructor again - caching the result doesn't rerun the constructor.
[14:34:09] <phelix> to populate all the different areas on the calculator
[14:34:31] <duch_kazatel> phelix let's start simple.
[14:34:54] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, thanks!
[14:34:56] <phelix> So I basically need to get a value for each individual slider
[14:35:11] <duch_kazatel> phelix right - that's what we're doing.
[14:35:15] <phelix> and there needs to be some listener on it so that it will always up
[14:35:18] <phelix> k
[14:35:24] <duch_kazatel> phelix ignore the listener.
[14:35:30] <duch_kazatel> your slider callback is handling that part for you.
[14:36:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to enumerate through every slider, push its value into an array, and then add the array indexes together.  alternatively, you could create a variable and just add everything together in one shot.
[14:36:44] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n could you rephrase your first question?
[14:37:23] <Forbidd3n> first when you scroll the navigation sticks to the top which is what I want, but the width isn't 100% of parent
[14:38:26] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n okay.  add width: 100%; to div.nav{}
[14:39:08] <Forbidd3n> it extends past the container on scroll - http://jsfiddle.net/BL7ce/1/
[14:39:57] <duch_kazatel> i give up on #jquery today.
[14:40:06] <phelix> duch_kazatel: well the each is going through each slider.. but it seems like that array thing you showed me is a complete over kill on how to build an array inside this each loop right
[14:40:17] <phelix> lol
[14:40:24] <phelix> im prob driving you crazy.
[14:41:23] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're in here constantly asking the same kinds of questions.  every time anybody suggests you try to actually learn to use JS/jQuery, you respond with how you don't have time.
[14:42:02] <phelix> Well, this is how I am learning. It at least helps me learn
[14:42:18] <duch_kazatel> see the first part of that statement - "... you're in here constantly asking the same kinds of questions."
[14:42:20] <phelix> I can stop asking though and just try to figure it out myself
[14:42:37] <phelix> yeah, i see what you are saying
[14:43:25] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n play around with the styles on the parent elements - looks like you're priobably not declaring a width on a parent that needs it, or you need to play with your styles a little mor.e
[14:56:49] <devslash> I know how to have a click event for a wildcard id class by doing something like this:  '[id^=delete_]' but is there an equivelent for classes?
[14:59:03] <duch_kazatel> '[class^=delete_]'
[15:00:06] <devslash> that does not trigger
[15:00:15] <devslash> that was the first thing i tried
[15:00:33] <duch_kazatel> !paste
[15:00:33] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:01:44] <systemfault> I would try to write it “properly” first '[class^="delete_"]' :/
[15:02:06] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: have you worked with jquery stellar.js?
[15:03:06] <ozoness> Hi guys! Is there an easy way to get an object with all the data-attr but without certain prefix? For example: ---HTML: <div class="uploader" data-uploader-crop="true"> ---JS: $('.uploader').data('uploader'); //Returns { crop: true }
[15:03:27] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/LhtJf/
[15:05:33] <devslash> why doesn't that work ?
[15:06:31] <ElysiumNet> devslash: ^= means starts with
[15:06:38] <devslash>  i know
[15:06:53] <ElysiumNet> the value isn't starting with calendarEvent-
[15:07:05] <ElysiumNet> it's starting with CTID-571-_
[15:07:06] <devslash> oh because of the other class name ?
[15:07:14] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/29/ There! i did it. :)
[15:07:16] <devslash> so how do i say contains
[15:07:27] <ElysiumNet> contains() ?
[15:07:39] <devslash> now
[15:07:44] <devslash> no
[15:07:48] <devslash> for an event handler
[15:07:49] <ElysiumNet> :contains()
[15:07:55] <ElysiumNet> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[15:08:15] <ElysiumNet> oh wait, that's for text
[15:08:17] <devslash> but how do you do that with an event handler
[15:08:21] <devslash> yea
[15:08:29] <ElysiumNet> devslash: it's still a selector
[15:08:32] <systemfault> devslash: '[class*="lol"]'
[15:08:34] <ElysiumNet> wildcard should be sufficient I guess?
[15:09:25] <devslash> like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/LhtJf/1/
[15:10:37] <devslash> err this is right: http://jsfiddle.net/LhtJf/2/
[15:11:21] <ozoness> hey guys, do you know how can I do something like that work? http://jsfiddle.net/rHtG9/1/
[15:11:24] <devslash> thanks its working now
[15:14:26] <ozoness> http://jsfiddle.net/rHtG9/2/ !helpme
[15:18:17] <ozoness> :(
[15:18:57] <duch_kazatel> ozoness what are you trying to do?
[15:19:22] <ozoness> hi duch_kazatel, look I made a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rHtG9/2/
[15:19:32] <duch_kazatel> right - what are you trying to do?
[15:20:07] <duch_kazatel> did you try this? http://jsfiddle.net/rHtG9/3/
[15:20:10] <ozoness> to pass options to a plugins through data-attributes
[15:20:42] <duch_kazatel> you can't get crop: true;
[15:20:44] <ozoness> yeah, that returns uploaderCrop, I need it to return crop
[15:20:50] <duch_kazatel> you cannot do that.
[15:20:59] <ozoness> really?
[15:21:00] <duch_kazatel> unless you change it to data-crop
[15:21:10] <duch_kazatel> or are willing to parse your data instead.
[15:21:36] <ozoness> mmmm ok, that sucks I guess :S
[15:22:00] <duch_kazatel> what plugin are you using?
[15:22:48] <ozoness> I made a plugin and I integrated with blueimp fileuploader
[15:23:03] <ozoness> I can use data-crop, but that doesn't seem right...
[15:23:04] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[15:23:11] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[15:23:37] <ozoness> cause I need to give it a scope so it doesn't mess with other data attributes...
[15:23:43] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/34/ I did it. :)
[15:23:45] <ozoness> (sorry my english sucks)
[15:23:51] <duch_kazatel> then create an object elsewhere on the page and reference that.
[15:24:29] <ozoness> mmm but I want to use data-attr cause I'll be loading a lot of uploaders...
[15:24:41] <duch_kazatel> phelix well done.  http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/35/ - thiis is a minor formatting change.
[15:24:42] <ozoness> I can't create an object for each one, they're dynamic
[15:24:55] <duch_kazatel> ozoness if you can add data attributes, you can create the object.
[15:24:58] <duch_kazatel> but okay
[15:25:50] <phelix> whats adding that test under theResult for ?
[15:26:02] <ozoness> I know, but It'll be a mess... I can believe I can't call a data-prefix and get its options :(
[15:26:11] <ozoness> can't*
[15:26:24] <duch_kazatel> ozoness you're expecting jquery to do magic for you
[15:26:25] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[15:26:30] <duch_kazatel> phelix it's a little more readable.
[15:26:45] <duch_kazatel> that's also what the JS engine does in cases like what you had.
[15:26:55] <ozoness> duch_kazatel: it does a lot of magic for me, why it can't do such a simple thing :D
[15:26:55] <duch_kazatel> the variable gets declared up at the top like that, and then set down below.
[15:27:05] <duch_kazatel> ozoness because that's not simple.
[15:27:23] <duch_kazatel> you're expecting it to parse through data-* attributes and infer relationships.
[15:27:30] <duch_kazatel> most folks wouldn't want that.
[15:27:35] <phelix> So here is a new question. If I do say console.log(valArray[0] or [1] etc I can now get the individual info of each slider. However, to add 2 values together couldn't I just do like what i'm doing on line 22?
[15:27:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix huh?  rephrase.
[15:28:37] <phelix> I can see the indivdual values of each slider now by displaying either valArray[1] or valArray[0] those have the values of the second and first values. So if I wanted to add those 2 values together couldn't I do like what I am trying to do on line 22 ?
[15:29:28] <duch_kazatel> phelix ... i feel like you're getting at something bigger.
[15:30:04] <duch_kazatel> phelix if you want to be able to guarantee which value "belongs" to which slider, you should consider using an object as your data store, instead of an array.
[15:30:18] <duch_kazatel> so you have a key of the slider and a value of the number
[15:30:25] <phelix> Well now that I have each value of each slider inside a single array. var slider1 = valArray[0]; and var slider2 = valArray[1]; etc
[15:30:28] <phelix> right?
[15:30:38] <phelix> yes
[15:31:18] <duch_kazatel> so then do the object instead of the array.
[15:31:25] <phelix> so if I wanted to add slider 1 and slider 2 together could I do like console.log(valArray[0]+valArray[1]);
[15:31:52] <duch_kazatel> you could do that, but if you need to rely on getting the values of slider1 and slider2, do a key/value instead.
[15:32:09] <phelix> well going that route doesn't seem to work
[15:32:14] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[15:32:22] <duch_kazatel> you can't key/value in an array.
[15:32:26] <duch_kazatel> but the object is easy...
[15:32:44] <phelix> I just get this when doing that.
[15:32:45] <phelix> [object Object][object Object]
[15:32:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?  one sec.
[15:32:54] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you're even doing now.
[15:33:01] <phelix> let me update the fiddle
[15:33:10] <duch_kazatel> Let me show you what I'm talking about.
[15:33:35] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/36/
[15:33:52] <duch_kazatel> that's not doing what I'm suggesting whatsoeve.
[15:33:54] <duch_kazatel> *whatsoever.
[15:33:59] <duch_kazatel> also - valArray.push($(parseInt(barValue)));
[15:34:02] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any sense.
[15:34:40] <duch_kazatel> why are those wrapped in a jquery call?
[15:35:38] <duch_kazatel> this is what I was telling you to do btw: http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/37/
[15:50:50] <uberjar> Hi.  I am appending a bunch of elements to a particular div using jquery.  After all the newly appended elements have loaded I want to measure their height.  How can this be accomplished ?
[15:51:55] <uberjar> if I just have a loop where I append the elements and then below it I iterate and measure the heights then I will get bad values because many of the newly appeneded elements will not have loaded yet
[15:52:31] <davf> What is $ representing in $.timer(xxx...)
[15:53:33] <davf> I'm trying to google it but because it's $. I can't find anything
[15:56:04] <duch_kazatel> jQuery
[15:56:05] <davf> Basically can I substitute $.timer for jQuery.timer?
[15:56:14] <duch_kazatel> yep
[15:56:18] <davf> thx
[15:56:56] <duch_kazatel> uberjar does this particular div contain only these elements
[15:57:26] <uberjar> duch_kazatel: yes
[15:57:35] <duch_kazatel> then measure the height of that div.
[15:57:46] <uberjar> duch_kazatel: I need the height of the individual elements
[15:57:52] <duch_kazatel> of each element?
[15:58:00] <uberjar> yes after each one has loaded
[15:58:09] <uberjar> so I can position them with absolute positioning
[15:58:11] <duch_kazatel> what's with this 'loaded' bit?  there an image in them?
[15:58:18] <uberjar> yea some of them have images
[15:58:25] <uberjar> they have diverse content inside
[15:58:37] <duch_kazatel> bind a delegation listener to wait for the load event and get the info that way.
[15:58:45] <uberjar> I think I just figured it out though...
[15:58:55] <uberjar> .ready() seems to do the trick
[15:59:04] <duch_kazatel> use .on('load', instead.
[15:59:32] <uberjar> so .on can be used for the entire collection not each newly inserted element ?
[15:59:39] <uberjar> er .on("load
[15:59:49] <uberjar> ok yea that's going to work it looks like
[15:59:51] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('load', 'child', function(){});
[15:59:56] <duch_kazatel> or just to the parent.
[16:00:00] <duch_kazatel> drop the child.
[16:00:06] <uberjar> yeah it seems it works just with the parent which is what I needed
[16:00:10] <uberjar> thnx a ton
[16:04:47] <phelix> duch_kazatel: sorry had a quick meeting. Ok there we go perfect thank yo!
[16:07:03] <duch_kazatel> kay
[16:17:49] <afroradiohead> alright guys, im a bit stuck and I need some opinions from some professionals
[16:17:59] <duch_kazatel> then you're in the wroooong place
[16:18:01] <duch_kazatel> (jk)
[16:18:02] <duch_kazatel> sup?
[16:18:07] <afroradiohead> lol, ok...
[16:18:38] <afroradiohead> i'm learning angular right now, and its cool and all, but I noticed I might run into a potential flaw mixing my javascript with my html
[16:19:07] <afroradiohead> but with jquery, i can develop without touching the html, which lets me work seperately from say a designer who only knows html/css
[16:19:22] <duch_kazatel> jQuery and Angular do NOT fulfill the same roles
[16:19:26] <duch_kazatel> do not fall into that mental trap.
[16:19:36] <afroradiohead> could you elaborate duch_kazatel
[16:19:45] <afroradiohead> what do you mean by roles
[16:19:47] <duch_kazatel> jQuery is a DOM abstraction library.
[16:20:18] <duch_kazatel> Angular is an MVW framework - much more suited to things like data binding.
[16:20:21] <tw2113> not all javascript is the same
[16:20:40] <afroradiohead> definitely
[16:20:45] <afroradiohead> i get that duch
[16:20:48] <duch_kazatel> in fact, Angular imports JQLite if you don't all ready have jquery on the page.
[16:21:43] <afroradiohead> the angular irc hasnt answered my question yet, but have you noticed if there's a way to work with angular without touching the html?
[16:21:58] <afroradiohead> like how jQuery does
[16:22:58] <duch_kazatel> i don't know.
[16:23:14] <systemfault> Touching?
[16:23:25] <duch_kazatel> i think angular assumes you need to use their templates.
[16:23:35] <duch_kazatel> backbone/riot are a much better solution for your case i think.
[16:23:39] <duch_kazatel> *solutions
[16:23:51] <afroradiohead> ok thanks
[16:24:08] <systemfault> You need to use {{var}} to print them and use attributes for loops/click/etc
[16:24:49] <afroradiohead> yeah, systemfault, i was wondering if angular would make it difficult for a designer with only html/css experience to work with a developer
[16:24:53] <afroradiohead> i guess it is
[16:25:37] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[16:25:42] <duch_kazatel> angular is a different way to approach that.
[16:25:47] <systemfault> afroradiohead: With jquery, your JS is coupled with the HTML structure.
[16:25:59] <duch_kazatel> the templating language should be easy for a designer, in fct.
[16:26:00] <systemfault> It's not "better"
[16:26:15] <systemfault> I think that what angular provides is more suited to a designer.
[16:26:55] <afroradiohead> yeah? interesting
[16:27:34] <afroradiohead> wait, angular is more suited to a designer?
[16:27:39] <systemfault> Yes.
[16:27:41] <duch_kazatel> afroradiohead the templates are, yes.
[16:28:01] <afroradiohead> okay, guess i gotta look up what templates are
[16:28:10] <systemfault> afroradiohead: Let's say you use jQuery…. and the designer changes the HTML, what happens to the JS?
[16:28:17] <duch_kazatel> templates are a big part of the reason people use angular.
[16:28:32] <systemfault> (The answer is, most of your bindings won't work anymore unless you fix them)
[16:28:45] <afroradiohead> systemfault: true, but if there's a standard i believe it may be easier to work with a change like that
[16:29:02] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:29:03] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[16:29:27] <afroradiohead> k, guess i gotta do a bit more research
[16:29:52] <duch_kazatel> is this a new company?
[16:29:58] <duch_kazatel> like, what's the scenario?
[16:30:28] <afroradiohead> its a hypothetical
[16:30:47] <duch_kazatel> because it all depends on the use case.
[16:31:48] <afroradiohead> i thought that if my designer knows no javascript, and he's constantly tweaking the html/css, what would make it less likely for my javascript code to mess up
[16:32:04] <duch_kazatel> angular templates ;)
[16:32:26] <afroradiohead> okie doke. yeah I definitely gotta look that up lol
[16:32:49] <systemfault> afroradiohead: To use angular templates… then the only thing your designers can mess up is the attributes on the template...
[16:33:32] <afroradiohead> but then the developer has to go into the html tags and add attributes right?
[16:33:38] <afroradiohead> ng-click here
[16:33:42] <afroradiohead> ng-show there
[16:33:47] <systemfault> With attributes and variable expansions ( {{variable}} ) your JS doesn't need to know anything about the structure of your HTML.
[16:34:12] <systemfault> afroradiohead: In the best case… they're already there because you wrote "basic html"
[16:34:33] <systemfault> Like… very basic HTML, ugly… full of <div>s, as long as you see something on the screen
[16:35:10] <systemfault> Because anyway, you need to test if it works.
[16:36:06] <afroradiohead> I think i got a little lost, but ideally angular templating should solve that specific scenario
[16:36:14] <afroradiohead> is what you guys are telling me
[16:36:41] <duch_kazatel> afroradiohead angular templates (which are fashioned after django templates iirc) are made for designers to use.
[16:36:50] <duch_kazatel> the developer can easily go in and add all the wiring.
[16:37:13] <afroradiohead> oh ok
[16:37:18] <duch_kazatel> there's no scenario where the two people will cross-over and touch the same files.
[16:37:28] <duch_kazatel> *where they WONT cross over i mean.
[16:37:31] <afroradiohead> ooh
[16:37:49] <duch_kazatel> like, sometimes the dev will have to touch the designer's HTML, and sometimes the designer might need to play a bit with the backend.
[16:37:50] <afroradiohead> ok yeah, i guess that's what i was looking for, a way for two people not to bother each other
[16:37:53] <duch_kazatel> but that should be fine.
[16:38:02] <duch_kazatel> they won't bother each other :)
[16:38:05] <socialblogsite> has anybody heard about mediamatch (weblinc)
[16:38:11] <afroradiohead> heh gotchya, thanks guys
[16:38:26] <duch_kazatel> what about it socialblogsite ?
[16:38:49] <socialblogsite> that one seems the faster one, but is that for IE?
[16:39:06] <duch_kazatel> the faster one what?
[16:39:19] <socialblogsite> (I’m trying to deploy a mobile menu, and they suggest to install that for IE support)
[16:39:42] <socialblogsite> the faster polifill something out of other versions non weblinc
[16:40:22] <duch_kazatel> who suggests that?
[16:40:42] <socialblogsite> http://jsperf.com/matchmedia/29
[16:41:00] <duch_kazatel> i can't understand your question.
[16:41:05] <socialblogsite> the developer of the mobile menu suggested it
[16:41:51] <BillCriswell> Sails.js is a good time so far.
[16:41:53] <socialblogsite> he just said “matchmedia”, but there seems to be many. I don’t know if all of them are fot the purpose he mentioned (IE compatibility)
[16:42:28] <duch_kazatel> socialblogsite is the developer saying you need to add it?  or....
[16:42:33] <duch_kazatel> still really lost about what you're asking.
[16:43:37] <socialblogsite> yes. but the dev said to install matchmedia, and the link takes me to a comparisson page, where OTHER variations of the matchmedia have been presented, and the weblink seems the faster one. I wondering whether that one (by chance) ends up NOT being for IE
[16:43:47] <CrowX-> how can I access the first li element of a ul list with a class .someList? is $(".someList").first() the way to go?
[16:43:59] <duch_kazatel> i'm having a really hard time parsing your question socialblogsite.  sorry =/
[16:44:01] <CrowX-> or $(".someList")[0].first() perhaps?
[16:44:10] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- that second one won't work.
[16:44:16] <duch_kazatel> .eq() iirc is what you want.
[16:44:30] <socialblogsite> duch_kazatel: If you don’t know about match-media, the quesiton wasn’t for you. :)
[16:44:33] <shoky> $(".someList > li").first()
[16:44:46] <socialblogsite> if you do, get an update! http://jsperf.com/matchmedia/29
[16:44:49] <duch_kazatel> all right duder.
[16:44:56] <duch_kazatel> i give up today.
[16:45:12] <BillCriswell> lol
[16:45:13] <afroradiohead> do you guys use a javascript framework, or do u stay with jQuery?
[16:45:19] <socialblogsite> no prob. if not knowing was a sin, I’d be damn!
[16:45:30] <CrowX-> shoky, and if I have "var someVar = $(".someList > li").first()", would "someVar.next()" bring me to the second item?
[16:45:41] <shoky> yep
[16:46:05] <CrowX-> k
[16:46:06] <CrowX-> thanks
[16:46:24] <BillCriswell> socialblogsite: What are you asking?
[16:47:10] <socialblogsite> Hi Bill: I’m asking if…  let me copy it
[16:47:37] <CrowX-> btw, I also want to iterate through all the li elements, what's the best/fastest/most efficient way to check if I've passed through all elements?
[16:48:11] <shoky> just pass through them all
[16:48:22] <shoky> e.g. .each(..)
[16:48:30] <socialblogsite> (I’m trying to deploy a jQuery mobile menu (shifter), and the dev suggest to install Match-media / Polifill for IE support), so I found this http://jsperf.com/matchmedia/29
[16:48:47] <socialblogsite> there are many variations, this seems to be the fastest one.
[16:49:05] <CrowX-> shoky, each() won't do cause I need to call them from a recursive function
[16:49:35] <shoky> each() will loop through them all, regardless of where you call it from
[16:49:38] <socialblogsite> My question is, (to anyone who knows it) will that work for original purpose (in IE) or that script is browser-independent?
[16:49:45] <BillCriswell> socialblogsite: Ok.
[16:50:11] <BillCriswell> It's a polyfill so it's meant to make any browser that doesn't support it natively support it (within reason).
[16:50:48] <socialblogsite> so any of them would work? i.e. I can go with the fastest benchmarked? :)
[16:51:06] <socialblogsite> (weblinc)
[16:51:18] <CrowX-> shoky, but it will loop one after another immediately. I want to have .5 seconds delay before each item
[16:51:48] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[16:51:58] <socialblogsite> :D thanks Bill
[16:52:07] <socialblogsite> your help is appreciate.
[16:52:29] <socialblogsite> I can answer questions about CSS and spanish, if anyone needs :P
[16:52:57] <shoky> CrowX- just check .next().length or something
[16:53:14] <BillCriswell> socialblogsite: No problem.
[16:54:40] <uberjar> fyi.. the "load" event for images doesn't work correctly after jquery append in all browsers
[16:54:53] <uberjar> I ended up going with something like this: http://desandro.github.io/imagesloaded/
[16:55:12] <uberjar> I wish jquery would include something like that ^ as part of the core lib
[16:55:24] <CrowX-> shoky, btw if I go with each(), what's the statement I need? $(".someList > li")each() {...}?
[16:55:37] <CrowX-> .each*
[16:57:14] <shoky> sure ynot
[16:58:01] <shoky> `api .each
[16:58:01] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[16:58:06] <shoky> `api each
[16:58:06] <b-ot> shoky: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[16:58:07] <BillCriswell> Dangit.
[17:15:51] <carpii> im migrating a codebase from jquery 1.4.4 to latest 1.x.   One thing im struggling to understand is when to use .prop() compared to .attr().   The docs suggest bool vealues must use prop (checked, disabled), but then also mention things like selectedIndex. Is there a complete list of affected attributes which now must use prop()?
[17:19:06] <BillCriswell> carpii: If you console.dir(el) the .attr() should be used on the properties in .attributes
[17:19:18] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[17:20:36] <carpii> hm, nice idea but not sure its accurate :)
[17:21:27] <carpii> or at least, attributes node only lists things which were set in the html source
[17:23:13] <carpii> should i just use .prop() for everything, and only use .attr() when i want to read the actual state which was set in html source?
[17:23:16] <shoky> .attr to set attributes (calls .setAttribute on the native element object)  and .prop to set properties (does element.property = ...; )
[17:23:43] <carpii> ok, i understand jquery has only changed cos the DOM model has changed, right?
[17:23:46] <BillCriswell> So I was.... kinda right.
[17:23:49] <shoky> there is no hard-set rule you can use. what makes it more confusing is that browsers sync between attributes/properties for some selected attributes
[17:24:12] <shoky> carpii: no jquery has changed because it did things wrong and now it's more correct
[17:24:18] <carpii> oh ok
[17:24:22] <carpii> i thought it coincided with dom changes
[17:24:36] <shoky> nope
[17:24:44] <carpii> do you know if jquery migrate would always warn me when i should be using prop?
[17:24:56] <shoky> i don't think it will
[17:24:56] <carpii> i know it does it sometimes, maybe i can get the exact rules from migrate src
[17:25:00] <carpii> oki
[17:25:03] <shoky> but not sure
[17:25:14] <carpii> the docs are really vague :(
[17:25:36] <shoky> they're just reflecting the state of things ;]
[17:25:48] <carpii> heh i know. web is piles of crap on top of piles of crap
[17:25:48] <shoky> and the state of things sucks, i agree ;]
[17:26:18] <shoky> i saw a nice list once though
[17:26:24] <shoky> maybe i can find it again
[17:26:35] <carpii> thatd be cool, ive tried googling but having a tough time
[17:27:00] <carpii> jquery docs mention some attributes dont have corresponding DOM nodes, so it says "For example, selectedIndex, tagName, nodeName, nodeType, ownerDocument, defaultChecked, and defaultSelected should be retrieved and set with the .prop() method."
[17:27:09] <carpii> but its not clear if the example is just an example, or a complete list
[17:30:20] <shoky> carpii:  the complete list is not jquery's job to maintain
[17:31:10] <shoky> managed to find a copy of this article, author has taken it down though.  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/timmywil/timmywil.github.com/blob/master/2011/When-to-use-.attr()-and-.prop().html
[17:31:35] <__joshua__> taken down because maybe it is misleading>
[17:31:36] <__joshua__> ?
[17:31:44] <shoky> maybe
[17:31:52] <__joshua__> well, hes in the jquery team (or was)
[17:31:56] <shoky> yup
[17:32:07] <shoky> that's why i mentioned the caveat
[17:33:29] <carpii> ah wow
[17:33:40] <carpii> theyve muddied the water so much by trying to make 1.6.1 back compat
[17:34:10] <carpii> well, by documenting it this way
[17:34:23] <tw2113> jquery team breaks back compat more than WordPress does
[17:34:25] <tw2113> i'm jealous
[17:34:26] <carpii> but it looks useful, thanks
[17:36:31] <cyclick> for many things it seems simpler to use plain javascript
[17:36:57] <carpii> hm i dont know, getElementById and then checking for null every time makes my stomach turn
[17:37:15] <shoky> plain javascript still has the same properties and attributes
[17:37:32] <carpii> yep, so its not really solving the issue
[17:37:39] <carpii> since id still need to know what to use when :)
[17:39:02] <carpii> i guess this is the clearest answer ive found
[17:39:03] <carpii> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19246714/html-attributes-vs-properties
[17:40:09] <BillCriswell> carpii: So.... I was kind of right.
[17:40:18] <duch_kazatel> what was the question?
[17:40:28] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: attr vs prop
[17:40:28] <carpii> yes Bill, kind of
[17:40:34] <shoky> doesn't really help to say attributes are HTML and properties are DOM
[17:40:40] <carpii> just console.dir only lists the ones that are explicitly set
[17:40:41] <duch_kazatel> 9/10, you want to use prop
[17:40:48] <shoky> .setAttribute is something you call on a DOM element, html is dead by then
[17:41:14] <BillCriswell> carpii: The dude who answered the question has taught me so much shit in IRC over the years.
[17:41:20] <BillCriswell> Don't think he gets on anymore though.
[17:41:23] <carpii> dude on stack overflow?
[17:41:30] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[17:41:33] <carpii> cool :)
[17:42:06] <BillCriswell> He used to seriously get pissed if something didn't work with javascript.
[17:42:32] <BillCriswell> This was like... 6-7 years ago. I image he loosened up a bit by now.
[17:42:39] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:42:43] <carpii> hehe
[17:42:50] <duch_kazatel> to master your toolkit, you first must hate it.
[17:42:59] <carpii> he probably moved into middle management, and doesnt code anymore :p
[17:43:15] <carpii> poor guy
[17:43:26] <duch_kazatel> nah - doctor probably told him to get offa irc.
[17:43:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel++
[17:43:41] <carpii> ehe
[17:43:45] <BillCriswell> or at least leave #web.
[17:43:46] <duch_kazatel> better for your blood pressure.
[17:43:55] <duch_kazatel> oooh how bad is #web
[17:43:57] <carpii> my doctor would probably say the same, but i havent found one who does online consultations yet
[17:44:08] <shoky> #web you say
[17:44:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It used to be pretty terrible haha. I think it's getting better lately.
[17:45:15] <BillCriswell> This channel gets pretty terrible at times.
[17:45:22] <duch_kazatel> word
[17:52:05] <BillCriswell> I need something to work on.
[17:56:17] <shoky> me too
[17:56:58] <duch_kazatel> i want something else to work on.
[18:00:44] <carpii> work on your procrastination
[18:00:59] <BillCriswell> carpii: I've worked on that entirely too much.
[18:01:06] <shoky> i'll do that later
[18:01:08] <duch_kazatel> that's why I'm here.
[18:01:09] <carpii> hehe
[18:01:31] <BillCriswell> I'm reading about new stuff coming up in Sass and I don't find too much of it useful?
[18:01:53] <shoky> did sass beat less? i'm clueless
[18:01:59] <duch_kazatel> i think it did.
[18:02:03] <shoky> cool
[18:02:03] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/1117
[18:02:05] <duch_kazatel> i just wanted nested selectors.
[18:02:08] <duch_kazatel> that's all i cared about.
[18:03:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: all I cared about was nesting and variables, but imagining css without extends and mixins would drive me nuts.
[18:03:17] <duch_kazatel> i hear that.
[18:03:29] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i exit.
[18:05:29] <BillCriswell> I wish I could get some scope in Sass.
[18:52:55] <acidjazz> ok ig ot a tricky one
[18:53:02] <acidjazz> i got a class defined that has a transition time
[18:54:47] <BillCriswell> boop
[18:56:46] <acidjazz> i basicaly want to modify its timing
[18:56:49] <acidjazz> but its not assigned yet
[18:57:00] <acidjazz> i need to assign it after
[19:01:01] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: .css('transition-duration', '2s') or somehting?
[19:03:14] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: so taht works to existing elements
[19:03:31] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: problem in my situation, is i need to change that timing before the class is assigned
[19:03:42] <acidjazz> cuz the animation starts after you assign it
[19:05:26] <BillCriswell> b0pop[
[19:05:57] <acidjazz> you get what im sayin BillCriswell
[19:08:17] <BillCriswell> So .css().addClass() wouldn't work?
[19:14:51] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: well the class has a duration
[19:14:59] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: that would overpower the .css woudlnt it
[19:15:21] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: .addClass().css() maybe?
[19:15:44] <BillCriswell> I'd have to try it out.
[19:16:19] <acidjazz> hmm it looks like the js is fine.. its the actual css assignment
[19:16:24] <acidjazz> if i change cvolor to blue it works
[19:16:28] <acidjazz> but my transition changing isnt
[19:16:50] <BillCriswell> The transition duration?
[19:17:01] <acidjazz> https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/17f4f4f56c6aad83c35b
[19:17:01] <acidjazz> yes
[19:17:06] <acidjazz> thats what im using
[19:17:17] <acidjazz> el = jquery element
[19:17:33] <acidjazz> see that bckground-color blue
[19:17:35] <acidjazz> thats working
[19:18:10] <acidjazz> the class has the actual animation instruction
[19:18:17] <acidjazz> so the duration time has to be in it right
[19:18:28] <acidjazz> so i think the animatino fires before it can respect the new duration amount
[19:19:05] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: What if you don't set the duration in the css?
[19:19:39] <acidjazz> hmm stopped owrking
[19:19:46] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: it wont animate
[19:19:52] <acidjazz> but hmm the ackground color blue stopped working
[19:20:11] <acidjazz> oh ok its owrking
[19:20:12] <acidjazz> let me try BillCriswell
[19:20:47] <acidjazz> just goes super fast
[19:20:51] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: heres my issue
[19:21:01] <acidjazz> i cant change the css of a class w/out assigning it
[19:21:07] <acidjazz> so i have to assign it first
[19:21:11] <acidjazz> but the animation fires UPON assignment
[19:21:17] <acidjazz> so its already too late to change its duration after it fires
[19:21:42] <acidjazz> id have to make the whole thing .css
[19:21:44] <acidjazz> and not a class
[19:21:47] <acidjazz> hmm
[19:26:08] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Oh man.
[19:26:39] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Figure out something.
[19:26:51] <acidjazz> lol
[19:27:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/gesiyaju/1/
[19:27:30] <BillCriswell> The $div.css('left'); is needed or the transition happens instantly.
[19:28:18] <acidjazz> whats that
[19:28:23] <acidjazz> left?
[19:28:31] <acidjazz> idgi
[19:28:41] <BillCriswell> I believe it triggers a repaint?
[19:29:51] <BillCriswell> I should look into that stuff a little more... but basically that tricks it into doing what we believe it should.
[19:30:45] <acidjazz> im just gona make a class for each time
[19:30:46] <acidjazz> for now
[19:31:27] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Quick thing, you don't need to loop through that css variable.
[19:31:47] <acidjazz> .css({}) i have issues with
[19:31:49] <acidjazz> doesnt always work
[19:32:12] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: It should be the same thing.
[19:33:25] <BillCriswell> Also, with '-webkit-transition-duration': "" + s + "s" you can just do: s + "s"
[19:33:38] <BillCriswell> THe "" + part isn't needed.
[19:35:11] <acidjazz> good ol stylus looping
[19:35:23] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: ah yea thats cs makign that
[19:37:18] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: im documenting this for an interview questions
[19:37:20] <acidjazz> this is real tricky
[19:37:24] <acidjazz> question*
[19:37:55] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Yeah, drove me nuts one night.
[19:38:10] <acidjazz> heres my solution https://gist.github.com/acidjazz/5ea774b7da2852f50846
[19:38:26] <acidjazz> i know ill only use this for about 2 of those
[19:38:27] <acidjazz> so
[19:38:29] <acidjazz> meh for now
[19:40:22] <BillCriswell> What made you go with stylus?
[19:44:15] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: its syntax mainly, and the plugin easability
[19:44:22] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: wirting js plugins is awesome
[19:44:32] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: also http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/
[19:44:40] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[19:44:48] <BillCriswell> I've looked into them all, been using Sass though.
[19:45:48] <acidjazz> also its node
[19:45:51] <acidjazz> w/ an api
[19:45:54] <acidjazz> so i can use it w/ any language
[19:45:55] <acidjazz> i use php
[19:46:05] <acidjazz> so i can use the api to proflie and benchmark it
[19:46:11] <BillCriswell> Got ya.
[19:46:14] <acidjazz> thast why i use jade as well
[19:46:18] <acidjazz> its syntax will accept sass
[19:46:22] <acidjazz> its just sweeter
[19:46:24] <acidjazz> and easier to read
[19:46:39] <acidjazz> youll love htis
[19:46:43] <acidjazz> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/syntaxtic/cgjalgdhmbpaacnnejmodfinclbdgaci
[19:46:46] <acidjazz> just foudn this otday
[19:46:53] <acidjazz> gonna fork it and fix a bug i found
[19:48:48] <acidjazz> heres my setup bill http://i.imgur.com/noBkgYe.png
[19:49:17] <acidjazz> bottomleft is coffeescript, to teh rigt is mirrored compiled JS, top left is jade templates for the html and mixin, top right is stylus.. you can see the new for loop i made for this
[19:51:31] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Haha nice. I can't get into coffee.
[19:52:10] <acidjazz> so i hated cofefe
[19:52:13] <acidjazz> for ever
[19:52:17] <acidjazz> and hte idea of it i hated
[19:52:24] <acidjazz> but the main reason i finally was turned on
[19:52:28] <acidjazz> was how it writes JS in a proper way
[19:52:44] <acidjazz> so i dont really use it for its convenience.. its more of a teacher for proper JS structure
[19:53:00] <acidjazz> seeing how it forms JS is helping me write more browser-comptaibel JS
[19:53:07] <acidjazz> theres a really good article about that i found
[19:55:39] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Makes sense.
[20:09:15] <jcutrell> Hey folks! Is it okay to set something on .done() after an $.ajax call?
[20:09:46] <acidjazz> i think w/ a .promise yes
[20:09:52] <jcutrell> as in, var the_call = $.ajax(); the_call.done(function(data){ // do things with data. });
[20:09:55] <acidjazz> but thats usually for iteration andtimeouts
[20:10:15] <acidjazz> id use the ajax .always
[20:10:16] <acidjazz> actually
[20:10:24] <acidjazz> .always is for any return
[20:10:27] <acidjazz> error or not
[20:10:29] <jcutrell> .always doesn’t run only on success though, right?
[20:10:37] <acidjazz> it always runs
[20:10:43] <jcutrell> yeah, I need something that runs only on success.
[20:10:47] <acidjazz> .success
[20:10:48] <acidjazz> then
[20:10:54] <jcutrell> What is .done for?
[20:11:28] <acidjazz> .always .success and .fail
[20:11:43] <acidjazz> thats for use w/ promise
[20:11:57] <jcutrell> Looks like .done replaces .success actually
[20:12:25] <acidjazz> whees it say that
[20:12:49] <acidjazz> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[20:12:53] <acidjazz> looks up to date
[20:13:14] <jcutrell> “async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated; you must use the success/error/complete callback options instead of the corresponding methods of the jqXHR object such as jqXHR.done() or the deprecated jqXHR.success()."
[20:13:18] <acidjazz> An alternative construct to the success callback option, the .done() method replaces the deprecated jqXHR.success() method.
[20:13:20] <acidjazz> i see
[20:13:27] <jcutrell> Cool deal.
[20:13:39] <acidjazz> .success isnt deprecated though
[20:14:04] <acidjazz> thats of the superset of XMLHTTPrequest
[20:16:21] <jcutrell> “Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.”
[20:24:15] <acidjazz> done fail and always
[20:24:27] <acidjazz> jcutrell: does it say if their return object is the same?
[20:24:40] <acidjazz> i like success more than done :/
[20:24:42] <acidjazz> done means always
[20:24:45] <acidjazz> doesnt make any sesnse
[20:24:52] <jcutrell> yeah, I think it was a convention decision
[20:33:12] <visualshock> can someone tell me why this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/g126iYW1
[20:34:29] <wasabii> Yo. There any method or plugin to do live CSS or attribute changes? For instance, I want to apply some CSS-like rules to elements that are added dynamically, but what I need to do isn't possible with CSS as far as I can tell.
[20:34:40] <wasabii> Other than timeouts.
[20:34:49] <wasabii> Something that would subscribe to whatever mutation events exist still, and deal with it.
[20:35:55] <Uhkis> ?api css
[20:35:58] <b-ot> Uhkis: .css(): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[20:36:38] <Uhkis> ?api attr
[20:36:38] <b-ot> Uhkis: .attr(): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[20:39:35] <Uhkis> wasabii: those are what you want?
[20:40:44] <wasabii> checking
[20:41:01] <wasabii> Those don't do anything with regards to mutation events.
[20:41:28] <wasabii> I need to have them magically run when stuff is added or moved.
[20:41:51] <Uhkis> just add those to your add/remove functions
[20:42:00] <wasabii> I can't. It's knockout.
[20:42:16] <wasabii> And I'm trying to separate the knockout components from the styles. Don't want them touching at all.
[20:42:38] <wasabii> reusable controls and all. =/
[20:43:01] <shoky> what do you mean, separate from the styles
[20:44:18] <wasabii> I have a reusable library, that uses knockout to generate HTML. I am now including that reusable component in my web site. I need to style the component's HTML. I do not want to edit the component. But, I have a specific style thing that I cannot accomplish in CSS (no previous selectors). It would be neat if there was some sort of jquery component that functioned exactly like CSS.
[20:44:58] <shoky> no previous selectors? what does that mean
[20:45:16] <Uhkis> can't knockout add some classes?
[20:45:24] <shoky> it can
[20:45:38] <wasabii> I give up.
[20:45:52] <shoky> sounds like you either want to .. use classes and CSS
[20:46:04] <shoky> or make a custom binding that applies whatever you want to the element on init
[20:46:09] <wasabii> Uh huh. I do want to use CSS, but CSS does not support selectors that can do what I want.
[20:46:38] <shoky> you can help css with classes
[20:46:43] <shoky> in key places
[20:46:50] <wasabii> I am seriously simply wondering if jquery has some sort of live query thing.  Imagine this:  $(document.live(() => $('.selector.magic').prev().css('classname'));
[20:46:56] <wasabii> Wouldn't that be nifty? That's all I'm wondering about.
[20:47:02] <shoky> no, not really
[20:47:19] <shoky> nothing very reliable at least
[20:47:38] <shoky> and it's the wrong way to design your app usually
[20:47:57] <wasabii> As I said: I cannot (am trying to avoid, very much so) editing the knockout components.
[20:48:03] <wasabii> It's not my code. It's a reusable component.
[20:48:33] <shoky> then make your own custom binding that extends (so to speak) the one you don't wanna touch
[20:51:50] <shoky> or trigger some event on init and do the rest in your own handler
[20:57:36] <teitoklein01> hi everyone! How to properly dynamically load an external js file using jquer
[21:13:26] <jphase> teitoklein01: if you can modify the HTML of your page then just use a script tag with an external src attribute. if you *absolutely* needed to use jQuery to do so then you could create a script tag and insert it into the head of your document.
[21:14:08] <jphase> xstile: stop spamming or the wrath of the gods will spite thee
[21:14:23] <duch_kazatel> weeeee
[21:17:15] <BillCriswell> weeee
[21:17:33] <BillCriswell> shoky: xstile is spammin dawg
[21:17:53] <duch_kazatel> they offering HOT HOT WEBCAME SECKS?
[21:19:07] <BillCriswell> I didn't click. I was SO tempted to though because why not click links from strangers?
[21:19:27] <BillCriswell> I am not tired at ALL.
[21:19:30] <BillCriswell> This sucks.
[21:19:40] <duch_kazatel> i can tell.  everything OK?
[21:20:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah shoky can you handle this xstile bot?
[21:20:22] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: wanna switch? :-)
[21:20:42] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I would if I could!
[21:21:15] <Uhkis> we could really use a nap room here at work
[21:23:00] <BillCriswell> I had a cot in my previous office... but it was for when I went out drinking after work and got really drunk.
[21:23:14] <BillCriswell> Now that I have a girlfriend it happens never.
[21:23:21] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell knows how to party.
[21:23:26] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I used to.
[21:23:31] <duch_kazatel> keep the cot - it comes in handy during marriage.
[21:23:58] <Uhkis> haha
[21:24:06] <BillCriswell> I have a really tiny girlfriend and a big bed so I can usually sneak in no matter what. She's a heavy sleeper.
[21:24:14] <duch_kazatel> lucky.
[21:24:18] <Uhkis> ooh, now i got show gratis too
[21:24:26] <Uhkis> i can feel the love
[21:24:35] <duch_kazatel> FREE HOT HOT SOLO SECKS 4 EVERY ONE
[21:25:23] <BillCriswell> Did you guys see the video of the cat tacking the dog that was trying to eat that kid?
[21:25:37] <duch_kazatel> yes.  totally (metal)
[21:25:46] <Uhkis> nope
[21:26:16] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-Opm9b2WDk
[21:26:54] <BillCriswell> Well, anyway, this guy on facebook is trying to argue with me because he is convinced the mom ran away from the kid.
[21:27:03] <duch_kazatel> wut
[21:27:12] <duch_kazatel> at the end when she probably went to call the po-po?
[21:27:49] <BillCriswell> I think the dog was coming back for seconds and she was chasing it off.
[21:27:56] <Uhkis> wow
[21:27:58] <BillCriswell> He was convinced she just up and bailed on the kid.
[21:28:44] <BillCriswell> The guy said the whole story in the comments and still "disagrees"
[21:28:53] <BillCriswell> I don't understand people like that.
[21:29:29] <duch_kazatel> it's so, that one time they're right, they can hold it over everybody else's head.
[21:29:45] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Hahaha good point.
[21:29:52] <Uhkis> why on earth wasn't that dog on a leash
[21:30:09] <duch_kazatel> because the owners were irresponsible shits who don't deserve to have a dog?
[21:30:10] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: Terrible owners I'd imagine.
[21:30:18] <duch_kazatel> or it was a stray
[21:30:42] <BillCriswell> The most populat comment on the youtube link explains the story.
[21:30:46] <BillCriswell> Well, rest of it.
[21:30:46] <Uhkis> "The owners were there also and she was bit by the dog as she tried to pin him in his yard. "
[21:31:07] <duch_kazatel> your facebook friend is kinda dumb, BillCriswell.  why would she just bail on the kid?
[21:31:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I have no idea.
[21:31:46] <BillCriswell> I was more annoyed I posted the comment from the video from the guy himself and he was still like "nope"
[21:32:02] <BillCriswell> He isn't my friend, friend of a friend haha.
[21:32:03] <Uhkis> here in finland we keep aggresive dogs on a leash
[21:32:11] <BillCriswell> I unfriend ignorance haha
[21:32:26] <duch_kazatel> good.
[21:32:38] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis you're supposed to here, too.  that dog will probably be put down
[21:32:39] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: We typically do too haha. This person just... messed up.
[21:33:03] <BillCriswell> The cat is such a bad ass though.
[21:33:05] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: that's pretty f'd up really, the owners should be put down
[21:33:43] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis yep.
[21:33:51] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, dat catte
[21:34:01] <Uhkis> well trained dogs don't even leave their own territory (yard)
[21:34:04] <duch_kazatel> dude just comes FLYING IN and starts ripping a face off.
[21:34:28] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis yep - don't need to tell me :) I've got a german shepherd and a choclate lab.
[21:34:32] <Uhkis> really weird behaviour from a cat imo
[21:34:37] <BillCriswell> Youtube comments are terrifying.
[21:34:46] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: Yeah, I was more shocked by the cat than the dog haha
[21:35:22] <Uhkis> typical cat would've rolled over and continue napping :D
[21:35:36] <duch_kazatel> maybe begged for food before going to sleep.
[21:52:35] <sqlnoob> Anybody familiar with jqwidgets and jqxtreegrids? I'm trying to load nested json data with different structure of root and children but I can't see any way to do this. Anybody can give me a direction or alternative tree tools with much better control?
[22:29:27] <Velveeta> re: that dog story, yes, that dog should have been on a leash... all dogs should be on leashes unless they're penned up in their own yard behind a fence, or are at a dog park where unleashing them is allowed
[22:29:38] <Velveeta> re: that cat story, that dude was a badass
[22:29:55] <Velveeta> also, from what i saw on the news earlier, yes, the dog will end up being put down, after a 10-day quarantine
[22:30:08] <Uhkis> thanks for the comments :-)
[22:30:25] <Velveeta> :D
[22:37:26] <ocha> Is there a more readable way to list the elements when delegating events? Here's what I have and thinking of doing (not sure if it's proper syntax though) http://jsfiddle.net/FzVLU/
[22:55:30] <zylophone> so, i'm trying to set some .data on some html that i'm creating in a function, but something's wrong somewhere - http://jsfiddle.net/pNn2N/
[23:01:16] <zylophone> ok - sorted for those who are idling! http://jsfiddle.net/pNn2N/1/
[23:22:35] <ocha> Is there a more readable way to list the elements when delegating events? Here's what I have and thinking of doing (not sure if it's proper syntax though) http://jsfiddle.net/FzVLU/
[23:23:28] <systemfault> ocha: I would add a common class.
[23:23:55] <systemfault> ocha: If you want to select all four of them… it's because their behavior are the same… so they should have a common class name.
[23:25:01] <ocha> systemfault: ah right. If I did have a lot of elements to select though, would what I wrote in the fiddle be right?
[23:25:48] <systemfault> No, selector needs to be a string.
[23:26:58] <ocha> and the only way would be something like: var divelements = $('#div1').attr('id') + $('#div2').attr('id')...etc. which would potentially be even messier?
[23:27:20] <ocha> just looking to see what's the best way to write something that's readable
[23:27:38] <jphase> ocha: you can comma delimit your selectors instead
[23:27:48] <jphase> $('#div1, #div2')
[23:28:22] <jphase> but a class would be better as systemfault said
[23:29:06] <ocha> jphase yeah but it has to be a string if I'm binding it to the event right? $('#divholder').on('click', '#div1, #div2, #div3, #div4', function(e){}
[23:29:49] <Cork> ocha: your better of adding a class to those elements instead of listing a long list of ids
[23:30:11] <ocha> yeah, systemfault suggested that
[23:31:25] <ocha> I think basically, I'm asking- is there a better way to format this:  $('#divholder').on('click', '#div1, #div2, #div3, #div4', function(e){}
[23:31:38] <Cork> ocha: see above :)
[23:31:54] <Cork> but no if you absolutely have to use ids then you have to list them all
[23:33:01] <Cork> ocha: ids are for unique elements, not groups, classes is specifically for identifying groups of elements
[23:33:13] <ocha> :) sorry guys,  i'm terrible at explaining. If I had to use ids, how do I use line breaks to format that line for better readability?
[23:34:06] <Uhkis> wouldnt this work: var divs = '#div1, #div2, #div3, #div4'; $('#divholder').on('click', divs, function() {.....
[23:34:38] <ocha> Uhkis, yeah it would. thanks!
[23:35:14] <Cork> Uhkis, ocha: that is still a selector that doesn't scale though
[23:35:16] <ocha> another question:  If I had to detect an id and a class, do I make two switch statements? http://jsfiddle.net/XDHX5/
[23:35:52] <Uhkis> Cork: but improves readability which was the goal
[23:36:01] <ocha> Cork: I'm just thinking of how to maintain readability if i had hundreds of different ids and classes, but dont actually need it right now
[23:36:30] <Cork> Uhkis, ocha: my point is you should basically never ever be in that position
[23:36:46] <Cork> cause if you are then you have structured your page badly
[23:36:51] <Uhkis> Cork: true, i'd use some clickable class or something
[23:36:59] <Cork> kinda ya
[23:37:08] <Cork> but preferably a more descriptive class
[23:37:16] <ocha> Cork: yeah using a class wouldve made more sense. What's a descriptive class?
[23:37:50] <Cork> ocha: it should describe the group of element you group
[23:38:06] <Cork> like .users .links .projects and so on
[23:38:33] <ocha> ok, that makes sense
[23:38:34] <Cork> it shouldn't describe actions like .click .hover ...
[23:39:18] <Cork> "clickable"
[23:39:27] <Cork> ^ seen that one way to many times
[23:39:31] <Uhkis> :)
[23:39:58] <ocha> Ya, i think I should rethink the page structure
[23:40:24] <ocha> another question:  If I had to detect an id and a class, do I make two switch statements or is there a way to combine it into one switch statement? http://jsfiddle.net/XDHX5/
[23:41:15] <Cork> ocha: your prob better of using if statements and .is()
[23:41:23] <Cork> it usually makes for a more readable code
[23:41:51] <Cork> if(self.is('#div1, .class1')) {}
[23:41:54] <Uhkis> that = this made me chuckle :D
[23:41:57] <zylophone> and more maintable code
[23:42:16] <Cork> zylophone: more readable === more maintainable :)
[23:42:30] <zylophone> 2 versions down the line when the boss doesn't want .hover to do something hover-like but wants it clickable
[23:42:37] <zylophone> Cork: not necessary
[23:42:39] <Cork> ocha: also define your that variable
[23:42:52] <zylophone> i can read latin, but i can't understand it
[23:43:04] <Cork> zylophone: yes, cause the readability is the number one problem in maintaining code
[23:43:30] <zylophone> i thought bad php programmers was the number one problem? ;)
[23:43:57] <Cork> zylophone: not really
[23:44:22] <Cork> cause you are still talking about sub problems under readable (at least in my experience)
[23:44:38] <Cork> bad php developers tend to love writing spagetti code
[23:44:44] <Cork> and that is horrible to read
[23:44:56] <ocha> Cork so in what cases would it make more sense to use switch statements instead of if statements?
[23:45:14] <Cork> ocha: ex. if you have a multi event listener
[23:45:40] <Cork> switch(event.type) { case 'click': case 'mouseover': }
[23:46:05] <Cork> ocha: basically if you ever only care about one variable
[23:46:08] <Cork> and many values
[23:46:39] <Cork> as soon as you start caring about compoind values you have to evaluate if the switch statement helps or hurts
[23:47:12] <zylophone> what's going wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/pNn2N/2/
[23:47:20] <zylophone> .data is empty for both?
[23:48:16] <Cork> zylophone: you create dom elements and add data on them
[23:48:24] <Cork> zylophone: but you never keep the elements
[23:48:38] <ocha> cork, ukhis learned a lot in the last 10 minutes. thanks!
[23:48:55] <Cork> bar: html string > parse bar to a dom element > set data on the element > add more html to the original string
[23:49:02] <Cork> > sed data on zar
[23:49:17] <Cork> > send html string
[23:49:37] <Cork> > append html (create new dom elements) > no data found
[23:49:52] <Cork> sed==send
[23:50:02] <Cork> opps no
[23:50:06] <Cork> *set
[23:50:18] <zylophone> aha - http://jsfiddle.net/pNn2N/3/
[23:50:33] <Cork> yup
[23:50:44] <Cork> though that isn't the same code
[23:50:52] <Cork> (it doesn't do the same thing)
[23:50:53] <zylophone> thanks. when i tried that in my code, it didn't work, so something else is broken!
[23:51:02] <zylophone> ?
[23:51:53] <Cork> zylophone: this does the same thing as the old code http://jsfiddle.net/pNn2N/4/
[23:52:04] <Cork> you didn't add zar as a child of bar
[23:52:47] <zylophone> what's the diff between add and append?
[23:52:59] <Cork> add adds it to the jquery collection
[23:53:14] <Cork> append appends it as a child of the element(s) in the collection
[23:53:28] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pNn2N/6/
[23:53:35] <zylophone> interesting, i didn't notice that, thanks
[23:53:39] <Cork> and a fixed up one where the selectors and logging works
[23:54:03] <zylophone> yeah, i fixed that in /5 :)
[23:56:46] <zylophone> ahh, it adds it as a child. strange
