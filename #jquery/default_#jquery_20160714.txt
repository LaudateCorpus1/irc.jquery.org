[00:35:41] <kromwell> My GET request returns undefined event though I set it to async which in theory should return the responseText after the request has been completed
[00:36:06] <kromwell> The request is working just fine and I can confirm this in firebug, but im unable to manipulate the response in the success function
[00:36:10] <kromwell> err, success callback
[01:04:52] <Cork> kromwell: you don't need to set it to async: false (you should avoid that)
[01:05:03] <Cork> kromwell: data isn't an xhr object it is the content of the response
[01:05:16] <Cork> kromwell: so just console.log(data)
[01:44:42] <indronil> Hi there
[01:45:18] <indronil> Need help converting svg to canvas using canvg
[01:46:53] <indronil> Can anyone provide any suggestion
[01:47:26] <indronil> Canvg does not work with complex svg based images
[01:49:01] <indronil> canvg works fine with rectangles and squares but not with ovals and triangles
[01:49:54] <indronil> I am trying to convert svg images into canvas before converting the canvas to png image
[01:59:28] <indronil> Can anyone help me with this , I am really stuck.
[04:26:21] <_Justice_> I have http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/19344801/ and want to only change text. Im guessing the best way is to add a span for the text?
[04:26:45] <_Justice_> since using .text on the button or html will just wipe the <i> one.
[04:40:10] <Cork> Justice: yes
[04:40:37] <Cork> you normally want the text you plan to change to not have other dom elements beside it
[04:58:03] <Justice> swheet
[05:00:22] <Justice> btw Cork from reading stackoverflow, we should be using .prop isntead of attr?
[05:01:58] <Cork> Justice: stay away from so, it is a REALLY bad place to learn how to use jquery
[05:02:17] <Cork> Justice: but yes, since jquery 1.7 .attr will give you the wrong result
[05:02:24] <Cork> and .prop is normally want you want
[05:02:42] <Cork> (the old .attr was split into two and what most used .attr for is now .prop)
[05:03:06] <Justice> I see
[08:21:15] <kes_> Hi. Can anybody help me with: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38308287/how-to-force-jquery-append-to-clone-events-too
[08:21:53] <codecutter> what the name of the event that would listen for a click/check on a radio button?
[08:22:09] <taplar> 'click change'
[08:23:47] <taplar> kes_: http://api.jquery.com/clone/  there are booleans that can be passed in
[08:24:27] <taplar> oh you want it to do it by default
[08:24:33] <taplar> :/
[08:25:00] <kes_> taplar: yes, but .append internally use .clone. and it has not options to set them to true
[08:25:19] <taplar> append only does clone if it is appending to more than one parent
[08:25:33] <taplar> otherwise it's just a move
[08:25:50] <taplar> and technically the existing element is moved to the last parent and cloned to the previous ones
[08:26:04] <kes_> Yes. I have to append more elements
[08:26:17] <taplar> i'd suggest try changing it to a delegated listener instead
[08:27:02] <shoky> hrm. i'm getting hired to do some landing pages for this company, they mentioned lead generation :S. i've never done these, is there something special i need to know :\   they are doing all the design
[08:27:27] <taplar> 'lead generation' ?
[08:27:29] <shoky> taplar save me
[08:27:34] <taplar> never heard of that
[08:27:48] <shoky> yah, SEO stuff i think :\
[08:27:54] <kes_> taplar: what do you mean under 'delegate'?
[08:28:47] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:29:20] <taplar> you bind the event to a shared parent and handle the propagated event from children elements.
[08:30:22] <taplar> oh
[08:30:36] <taplar> if this is accurate, https://www.marketo.com/lead-generation/, lead generation is like BI
[08:31:16] <shoky> BI sounds even more vague to me
[08:31:25] <taplar> "business intelligence"
[08:31:27] <shoky> they also mentioned mailchimp integration
[08:31:39] <shoky> yeah, vagueness galore
[08:31:52] <taplar> gathering information about current sales, social trends and such, to make guesses about what will sell
[08:32:18] <shoky> hm. well that doesnt sound like it has anything to do with me, good
[08:35:22] <taplar> we use BI here, though I dunno how big we are on the social data gathering we are.  we may just buy that stuff from someone, *shrug*  not my department, :)
[08:35:40] <Rokko_11> Hi! I try to use the jQuery Themeroller http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/, but if I change something, nothing changes.
[08:36:13] <Rokko_11> In the Network-Tab of my browser I see, that the Ajax-Call to parsetheme.css does not finish.
[08:36:34] <Rokko_11> after some time (1 minute?) I get a 504 Gateway Timeout.
[08:37:52] <Rokko_11> Do you know, what's happening here?
[08:37:55] <codecutter> how can i check if the radio button is already check upon click?
[08:38:23] <taplar> Rokko_11: i don't mess with the themeroller much.  someone else may be able to help
[08:38:34] <taplar> codecutter: you can check 'this.checked' for true
[08:38:38] <kes_> taplar: thank you. That resolve my problem in more relayable way. +1
[08:38:45] <taplar> ;)
[08:39:21] <gevs> hello people - im doing a simply $.ajax() request that get blocked by adblock ; all this request does is returning JSON items (with links in it)
[08:39:36] <gevs> any hint on "what an adblocker" doesnt like?
[08:39:39] <gevs> for me to bugfix this :)
[08:39:48] <taplar> adblock as in the firefox plugin?
[08:39:52] <gevs> yeah :/
[08:40:01] <shoky> it doesn't like urls that are in its filter ;)
[08:40:12] <gevs> oh come on
[08:40:16] <gevs> no thats not possible hahaha
[08:40:16] <shoky> has nothing to do with what the response contains
[08:40:19] <gevs> im on my localhsot
[08:40:20] <codecutter> like this? if($(event.target), function(){if(this.check === true){}};
[08:40:27] <shoky> gevs  what's the url?
[08:40:34] <shoky> full url
[08:40:38] <gevs> dev.greg.loc/...
[08:40:44] <shoky> that's not a full url
[08:40:45] <gevs> hold on yes
[08:41:03] <taplar> codecutter: inside your event handler it would just be if (this.checked) { ... }
[08:41:23] <gevs> http://dev.greg.loc/affiliate/getNextLevel/1256/1?filters%5Bstatus%5D=all
[08:41:51] <gevs> ha, maybe its that encoded array oO
[08:42:40] <shoky> and what makes you say adblock is blocking it
[08:42:50] <gevs> javascript console
[08:43:02] <gevs> whenever i click the button it gives me "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT"
[08:43:08] <gevs> then i disable adblock for the site, and it works
[08:43:18] <shoky> i don't remember if you can see in adblock a list of everything it filtered
[08:43:25] <gevs> let me check that
[08:43:34] <Rokko_11> Is the code of http://jqueryui.com/themeroller somewhere available? If yes, I can debug myself :)
[08:43:34] <shoky> with ublock you can see exactly what rule caused what to be blocked
[08:43:38] <taplar> you should be able to whitelist some things i would think
[08:43:49] <shoky> yah
[08:44:01] <taplar> heh, i actually have it running right now.  i could just check X|
[08:44:21] <gevs> yes taplar i can whitelist it
[08:44:28] <gevs> but thats not my objective
[08:44:40] <shoky> /affiliate/  seems smelly ;p
[08:44:47] <gevs> as shoky mentions i want to know why it gets filtered in the first place
[08:44:52] <taplar> https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt
[08:44:59] <gevs> really ? xD haha
[08:45:02] <gevs> it would make sense though
[08:45:10] <shoky> that url isnt getting blocked by my ublock, with easylist
[08:45:11] <gevs> thanks taplar haha jus tgot there :D
[08:45:39] <taplar> quick search, affiliate is listed 100 times
[08:46:23] <shoky> yea lots of /affiliate/
[08:46:29] <gevs> oh yeah
[08:46:37] <taplar> kes_: don't forget to update your S.O.  let others know, ;)
[08:48:35] <gevs> .net/affiliate/
[08:48:41] <gevs> lol they dont like that apparently xD
[08:49:04] <gevs> ok its probably linked to my url
[08:49:14] <gevs> thanks for discussing:)
[08:49:17] <kes_> taplar, one month later
[08:49:37] <taplar> oh, is that question that old?
[08:49:52] <kes_> maybe someone Offer another clue
[08:50:31] <kes_> if no, I get some special score from S.O )
[08:51:26] <taplar> i mean.... you could do the each on the stack and do the clone yourself
[08:51:33] <taplar> but delegates are just cleaner
[08:52:35] <taplar> by each i mean: cols.each(function(){ $(this).append( COL_TOOLS.clone(true, true) ); });
[08:54:25] <gevs> oh hell yeah - modified my route and it works like a charm
[08:54:48] <taplar> developer gevs, circumventing adblock, one page at a time
[08:55:20] <gevs> haha
[08:55:48] <kes_> taplar: I have tried .each - it looks ugly. And I liked to delegate
[08:56:09] <taplar> just providing an alternative, but I agree
[08:56:11] <kes_> taplar: How to delegate .resizeable? (onresize???)
[08:56:21] <taplar> huh?
[08:57:14] <kes_> COL_TOOLS I add should be resizeable
[08:57:19] <shoky> you shouldn't really clone jquery-ui widgets.  and if you do, you shouldn't be expecting them to work.  you should clone regular elements and then initialize the widgets on them
[08:57:44] <shoky> (and destroy the widgets before cloning, if already initialized)
[09:17:01] <PCatinean> a[data-action=new_product]
[09:17:04] <PCatinean> what kind of selector is this?
[09:17:14] <taplar_afk> tag with paired attribute
[09:17:16] <PCatinean> and how come it does not work with a[href=/some_link]
[09:17:17] <PCatinean> ?
[09:17:25] <taplar_afk> put quotes around the value
[09:17:30] <PCatinean> why only to href?
[09:17:51] <taplar_afk> the slash is probably fubaring it
[09:18:06] <taplar_afk> general rule with attribute selectors, always use quotes around the value
[09:18:18] <PCatinean> yeah, saw a original example that used none of those. Stupid
[09:18:23] <PCatinean> thanks so much for pointing it out taplar_afk
[09:18:49] <PCatinean> also very nice I've received help from a mentalist that uses his brain to type XD
[09:18:51] * PCatinean giggles
[09:18:56] <taplar_afk> :D
[09:19:17] <taplar_afk> finishing up some breakfast
[09:19:38] <PCatinean> Is it nutricious delicious?
[09:19:46] <taplar_afk> eh, lol
[09:19:51] <PCatinean> Waffles? Pancakes? Cereal?
[09:19:57] * PCatinean a bit hungry
[09:20:01] <taplar_afk> eggs n bacon
[09:20:07] <PCatinean> yuuum
[09:20:15] <PCatinean> bacon is life, bacon is love
[09:20:27] <taplar_afk> the eggs would be better if it had bacon bits in them
[09:20:53] <taplar_afk> best thing eva
[09:21:31] <shoky> taplar_afk can you elaborate what you meant with "we use BI here" ?
[09:21:54] <taplar> we collect various information about sales.  past sales, current sales, etc.
[09:21:56] <PCatinean> now look what you've done. You removed the man away from his bacon
[09:22:03] <PCatinean> This is punishable by death in some countries
[09:22:12] <PCatinean> Ok I will stop the offtopic trolling sorry :)
[09:22:16] <taplar> and we do analysis to predict, project what sales will be like
[09:22:23] <shoky> whoops didn't notice there's bacons in jeapordy
[09:22:48] <shoky> gotcha, thx
[09:22:56] <taplar> we also do so on a person by person basis
[09:23:20] <taplar> to see what you like and advertise related products, or things other people who bought that stuff also bought, etc
[09:23:41] <shoky> my current guess is i will need to make some landing pages, maybe with forms where users enter their details - that's the "lead generation" part, i guess it will be submitted into salesforce or something.
[09:24:05] <shoky> just hope they don't count on me to do any SEO
[09:24:59] <shoky> yes i need to find a real job.
[09:25:06] <taplar> *had to google*  yeah, i've read a few things about people complaining about SEO
[09:25:35] <shoky> seo means making google like your page
[09:25:58] <shoky> afaik
[09:26:02] <taplar> yah
[09:26:11] <taplar> listing you closer to the top of results
[09:26:42] <taplar> i kinda feel like if that's your main objective, your not advertising properly, :D
[09:27:23] <taplar> but i guess smaller business don't really do a lot of newspaper and tv ads
[09:28:33] <shoky> yep.  friend of mine opened a site for his dad's pharmacy here ~4 years ago.  he worked his ass off for years doing SEO just right to make google love him.  now he's half retired thanks to all the sales it got them.  :@
[09:28:57] <shoky> i need to find some pharmacy owner.  or a pet store
[09:30:31] <lahaugen87> Only 4 years? :o
[09:31:57] <shoky> well he was also working a dev job those years saving a lot of money, but few months ago he left that job and now living off the pharmacy sales, doesn't plan to work for the next few years ;p
[09:36:29] <shoky> worked at same place i did, in fact. the company closed few months ago,  hence i'm lacking a job as well
[09:36:48] <shoky> hence, landing pages :S
[09:37:02] <Duikb00t> Hello, has someone an idea what I might be doing wrong? https://www.pastery.net/qybyfd/  I try to select the value of the name attribute
[09:37:14] <Duikb00t> I always get undefined.
[09:38:13] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/h2dc1da3/  better
[09:38:14] <Duikb00t> ;)
[09:38:28] <shoky> Duikb00t:  'product_data ...'   finds <product_data>  elements ;p
[09:39:01] <shoky> also you're just getting a jquery object
[09:39:02] <Duikb00t> forgot the dot dammit
[09:39:11] <shoky> of the element. not its value
[09:40:54] <shoky> i would do  $(this).closest('.wrapper').find('.serial')
[09:40:57] <shoky> .val()
[09:41:11] <IamTrying>  $('#3ui02_list2').find('.is_selected');  console.log(find_selected_items.length); even there is 50 is_selected but i am getting 0 always.
[09:41:13] <shoky> no need for all the rest.
[09:41:32] <Duikb00t> But that just gives an empty value
[09:41:37] <Duikb00t> :P
[09:41:40] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/h2dc1da3/2/
[09:41:54] <Duikb00t> I want the value of the name
[09:41:59] <Duikb00t> name="blahalhala"
[09:42:01] <shoky> IamTrying then either your selectors are wrong, or the elements don't exist at the time you're running that
[09:42:03] <Duikb00t> I would like to grab blahahaha
[09:42:10] <Duikb00t> not the value of the field
[09:42:25] <shoky> Duikb00t: you get attributes with .attr
[09:42:32] <Duikb00t> yeah also negative tried it :P
[09:42:51] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/h2dc1da3/3/
[09:43:02] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/h2dc1da3/4/
[09:43:04] <Duikb00t> nvm fixed
[09:43:05] <Duikb00t> lol
[09:43:08] <shoky> :\
[09:43:25] <IamTrying> shoky: <div id="3ui02_list2"> </div> was empty $('#3ui02_list2").append( was used..  now how do i find how many items inside that div has is_selected class?
[09:44:08] <shoky> IamTrying:  what you wrote should work.  so you're doing somethign wrong.  make a jsfiddle
[09:45:05] <Duikb00t> shoky:  Have you an idea how I can do this it's pretty hard :
[09:45:33] <IamTrying> OK - typo. is_selected was i_selected shoky
[09:45:35] <IamTrying> thank you
[09:45:48] <shoky> Duikb00t: ?
[09:46:43] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/h2dc1da3/5/
[09:46:49] <Duikb00t> check line 10 of the js
[09:47:01] <Duikb00t> the index before the [serial_no] is one that I wan to change with a variable
[09:47:28] <Duikb00t> [dynamicNamehere][incrementVariable][serial_no]
[09:53:07] <Duikb00t> shoky:  Think I got it :D oldString.replace('[0]', '[' + id_count + ']');
[09:54:55] <shoky> Duikb00t: yes if it's always 0
[09:55:06] <Duikb00t> it start always with 0
[09:55:10] <shoky> Duikb00t: if not, this works  https://jsfiddle.net/h2dc1da3/6/
[09:55:19] <Duikb00t> I just need to attach it again to the name attr
[09:55:24] <shoky> could def be simplified
[09:55:42] <Duikb00t> insane thanks :D
[09:55:55] <Duikb00t> simplified == refactored?
[09:56:09] <Duikb00t> ( Question out of the box )
[09:56:25] <shoky> no, i just mean the regex i used in the replace could probably be simplified
[09:56:57] <Duikb00t> oh ok
[09:57:20] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to attacht them
[09:57:25] <Duikb00t> to the attr again from the current one?
[09:57:31] <Duikb00t> var oldString = $(this).parent().find('.product_data input.serial:text').attr('name');              var testName = oldString.replace('[0]', '[' + id_count + ']');
[09:57:43] <shoky> .attr is used to set attributes
[09:57:48] <Duikb00t> $(this).attr('name', testName); is not doing it
[09:57:55] <shoky> that's the wrong element
[09:58:03] <Duikb00t> ooh indeed
[09:58:29] <Duikb00t> andthis? oldstring.attr('name', testName); is not doing it
[09:58:34] <Duikb00t> that should be the current element no?
[09:58:38] <shoky> oldString is not an element
[09:58:53] <Duikb00t> it's just the value?
[09:59:05] <shoky> you don't know what it is?
[09:59:12] <shoky> you even logged it
[09:59:26] <shoky> its name is also a hint
[09:59:30] <shoky> its a good name :)
[09:59:41] <Duikb00t> But.. it's the value of the intial value
[09:59:45] <Duikb00t> of the name attr
[09:59:53] <shoky> that doesn't sound like an element
[09:59:58] <Duikb00t> exactly
[10:00:14] <Duikb00t> $(this).parent().find('.product_data input.serial:text').attr('name', testName);
[10:00:37] <shoky> that is indeed an element.  but there's no need to do all that twice
[10:00:58] <shoky> var elem = $(this).parent().find('.serial');
[10:01:04] <shoky> then you can just reference elem
[10:01:06] <shoky> twice
[10:02:00] <Duikb00t> somewhat like this
[10:02:01] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/thqwrr/
[10:03:36] <Duikb00t> omg still not attached :D
[10:04:45] <Duikb00t> Oh it's doing the increment not always dammit
[10:05:59] <Duikb00t> shoky: It's weird, it's generating the indexes but in reverse mode
[10:09:00] <Duikb00t> Made a new fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/opn59605/1/
[10:10:31] <Duikb00t> I
[10:13:47] <geri> hi, is there a way to deactivate keypresses on buttons?
[10:14:29] <shoky> Duikb00t: whats the problem ?
[10:15:00] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/opn59605/4/  The problem is when I click add that it takes the first div that is being cloned to attacht the value to I stried
[10:15:33] <Duikb00t> to add (last) to get the last item but the indeing is not correct
[10:15:36] <Duikb00t> it stays 0
[10:15:38] <hypnotizes> hi is it possible to return a value with ajax error call?
[10:16:20] <geri> hi, is there a way to deactivate keypresses on buttons?
[10:16:29] <Duikb00t> Please shoky https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/opn59605/5/ take this example
[10:16:31] <shoky> Duikb00t: at first id_count is 0, so it sets it to 0, to it stays at 0
[10:16:33] <Duikb00t> it will make lots of more sense
[10:16:37] <shoky> Duikb00t: then , it sets to 1
[10:16:45] <shoky> Duikb00t: then your replace of [0]  doesnt find [0] anymore
[10:17:08] <shoky> that's why i asked if you're always going to be searching for [0] exactly
[10:17:21] <Duikb00t> Oh
[10:17:23] <Duikb00t> ><
[10:17:25] <Duikb00t> merde
[10:18:10] <Duikb00t> Do you have a suggestion what I can do to solve this the bets?
[10:18:12] <Duikb00t> best*
[10:20:10] <shoky> i gave you an example with a regex that replaces any number there
[10:20:40] <geri> any ideas guys?
[10:21:10] <shoky> geri what do you mean?
[10:21:41] <geri> if the button is focused and you press enter or spacebar you pressed the button
[10:21:53] <geri> i want to avoid any keypress besides the mouse for the button
[10:22:34] <geri> shoky: do you understand?
[10:25:02] <geri> shoky: something like that: http://ideone.com/bgsV3J
[10:25:49] <Duikb00t> haha shoky im getting lost
[10:26:00] <Azrael_-> hi
[10:26:01] <shoky> Duikb00t  https://jsfiddle.net/opn59605/6/
[10:26:17] <geri> shoky: do you understand?
[10:27:00] <Duikb00t> leme study that wait
[10:27:51] <shoky> geri: what is happening due to the keypress that you dont want to happen?
[10:30:55] <Duikb00t> shoky:  OK I get it figured it out and added the other fields with the index as well!
[10:30:59] <Duikb00t> Thanks alot for you assistance wow
[10:32:45] <geri_> shoky: the button submit should not be executed
[10:34:53] <shoky> geri: think you can .preventDefault() on keydown/keyup events
[10:36:03] <Azrael_-> can i use css-selectors to find a table row which has the attribute rowspan>1?
[10:38:18] <shoky> [rowspan][rowspan!=0]    :P
[10:38:21] <shoky> er
[10:38:24] <Duikb00t> shoky:  am I allowed to ask 1 more?
[10:38:30] <shoky> [rowspan][rowspan!=0][rowspan!=1]    :P
[10:38:56] <shoky> Duikb00t: as many as you want.. as long as you've tried yourself
[10:39:11] <Solarlux> What is innerHeight innerWidth?
[10:39:13] <Duikb00t> I have tried but it didnt succes but it's hard to make a paste this time
[10:39:17] <Solarlux> Its like a padding in css?
[10:39:44] <Duikb00t> All this JS is being used on a dynamic associative array in PHP https://www.pastery.net/acwwum/
[10:39:47] <Duikb00t> IT's generated like that
[10:40:00] <Duikb00t> Now there are like 6 foreaches currently to create the whole list.
[10:41:00] <Duikb00t> wait wait
[10:41:17] <Duikb00t> i think I am able to solve this with php if I just set for every looped item for every foreach a hardcoded 0
[10:41:27] <Duikb00t> So they all start with index 0
[10:41:50] <Azrael_-> shoky: thanks
[10:43:37] <Duikb00t> hmmm
[10:43:58] <Duikb00t> it's incrementing for all of hte loops
[10:44:09] <Texan> hey guys, anyone have experience with jqwidgets?
[10:44:12] <Duikb00t> I should keep the counter only in each wrapper element and then reset it I guess
[10:45:08] <Duikb00t> Is that possible to reset the value if an element get's cloned outside it's current .wrapper div?
[10:48:18] <prillian5> Is there an event-handler to check how much px the browserwindow had scrolled down?
[10:49:44] <geri> shoky: im not sure about: $("submit").keypress(function (e) {
[10:53:52] <shoky> geri: that looks for a <submit> element ;p
[10:54:21] <geri> but how to address my Ok button?
[10:54:44] <geri> shoky: in here http://ideone.com/bgsV3J
[10:55:08] <shoky> oh i thought you meant a form submit button..
[10:55:34] <shoky> anyway make a jsfiddle
[10:56:10] <Duikb00t> >< dammit
[11:01:07] <Duikb00t> shoky:  You maybe have an idea how I can accomplish that to keep the increment ID only insdie the wrapper? When Im in an other .wrapper div I want to start again from 0 ( == reset the increment value )
[11:01:46] <Duikb00t> OR I can set a data-inc="0" at every cloned element as start? Grab that value and increment that one on clone?
[11:02:07] <shoky> Duikb00t hard to answer without a fiddle, not sure what youre doing exactly... but probably you can each time count the number of such elements there are, and do +1 to that number..
[11:02:11] <shoky> or something like that :S
[11:02:47] <Duikb00t> Sound legit >count the times that a .product data div class is rendered inside the current .wrapper class
[11:03:02] <shoky> sounds legit ;p
[11:03:58] <Duikb00t> Should I first go ' up ' in the dom and select it from the ( from a .wrapper ) perspective?
[11:05:22] <shoky> donno what you mean... but in event handlers i usually do that.. go "up" with .closest(selector)
[11:05:25] <shoky> and then down with .find
[11:05:32] <shoky> if thatsw hat you mean..
[11:05:57] <Duikb00t> hmm .size or .length to count them
[11:06:00] <Duikb00t> ( I think im allmost there)
[11:07:31] <Duikb00t> $amoutn_elements = ($(this).parent().find('.product_data').size());
[11:07:32] <Duikb00t> bam
[11:07:52] <Duikb00t> * var amount_elements = (  ;P
[11:10:23] <Duikb00t> ok next issue is for tomorrow
[11:10:24] <Duikb00t> goot night
[11:10:25] <Duikb00t> :P
[11:10:28] <Duikb00t> thanks a lot for the support
[11:10:29] <Duikb00t> :D
[11:11:52] <shoky> byby
[12:15:47] <jose3_> How can I write this wore efficiently https://gist.github.com/toymechqm/0e7f0159f1680358d322da46f964ee05 ?
[12:16:19] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:16:26] <jose3_> uh oh
[12:16:34] <robertmaxrees> so for starters, why aren't you using var
[12:16:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:16:58] <jose3_> you mean because those are now global right?
[12:17:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:17:18] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe make a fiddle with some example data and stuff?
[12:17:27] <jose3_> can do
[12:47:17] * taplar keeps looking at that 'can do'
[12:47:37] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:47:49] <robertmaxrees> maybe it was just an acknowledgement.
[12:47:57] <robertmaxrees> he can.  he just won't.
[12:48:18] <taplar> or some odd Buddhist truth
[12:52:09] <FishPencil> How could I include a common header on a purely client side site? I'm thinking of using an iframe since .load() isn't working for file:// urls
[12:52:27] <taplar> you could pull in the view with ajax
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> except file://
[12:52:58] <taplar> true
[12:53:13] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil you can't really access the local filesystem in normal browsers.
[12:53:39] <taplar> use // and develop on a localhost
[12:53:44] <hmmhesays> So out of curiosity is there a goto IDE for jquery ?
[12:53:54] <robertmaxrees> hmmhesays jquery isn't a language, so nope :)
[12:54:01] <FishPencil> If I did an iframe with a single common css file to style it, can the iframe "effect" the main page? As in, can the navigation links bring you to that page, or will it load in the iframe
[12:54:04] <hmmhesays> for javascript
[12:54:06] <taplar> whatever your favorite text editor is
[12:54:13] <robertmaxrees> hmmhesays i use vscode right now.
[12:54:14] <taplar> though sublime_text is just awesome
[12:54:18] <robertmaxrees> sublime and atom are both pretty good, too.
[12:54:39] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil the iframe is almost completely sandboxed
[12:54:58] <robertmaxrees> css doesn't cross that boundary.
[12:55:01] <FishPencil> was afraid of that, so that isn't a solution
[12:55:09] <taplar> it's not an ideal solution
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil you said the file is local, right?
[12:55:22] <FishPencil> right, something like "header.html"
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> are you working with a server of any kind?
[12:55:40] <FishPencil> no
[12:55:45] <robertmaxrees> you need to change that first.
[12:55:54] <robertmaxrees> because you can't load files off your filesystem otherwise.
[12:55:56] <FishPencil> so it's not possible then?
[12:56:12] <hmmhesays> I usually use notepad++ in windows
[12:56:13] <robertmaxrees> it's possible if you have a server.
[12:56:13] <taplar> are you intending other people to use this?
[12:56:16] <hmmhesays> vim in *nix
[12:56:24] <FishPencil> you could include a javascript file that modifies the body to add the header, correct?
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil you could, but that's... unusual.  why not just setup a server?
[12:56:56] <taplar> are you intending other people to use this site?  FishPencil
[12:57:46] <FishPencil> taplar: not sure, does it matter?
[12:57:51] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:58:09] <FishPencil> why does that change the proof of concept?
[12:58:29] <robertmaxrees> menas you really should use a server.  it'll make your life much, much easier.
[12:58:36] <taplar> making it work without a server is very different from doing it with a server
[12:58:47] <taplar> so if your going to do it with a server in the long run, just start out that way
[12:58:49] <robertmaxrees> ^ and if you're doing a PoC, you want to know what's really possible.
[12:59:59] <taplar> if hosting is the concern then there are all kinds of free sites out there.  heck, github has their own hub pages now days
[13:00:13] <taplar> with the bonus, version control, :D
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, that probably won't give them what they really need in this case.  you can do free (or extremely inexpensive) heroku and aws setups.  you could also just setup a local dev server.
[13:01:00] <taplar> yeah heroku would work too
[13:01:15] <taplar> i was just thinking github cause he's talking about complete front end only
[13:01:29] <FishPencil> what if I'm writing documentation pages that I'd like to have a common nav/header on, and those will be distributed with a package, thus the need for no server
[13:01:37] <geri> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/3k61a48g/
[13:01:51] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil then you want what's called a static site generator :)
[13:02:13] <geri> shoky: how an i catch the keypress (enter, spacebar) so that the dialog does not close?
[13:02:14] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil that will generate the html for you using templates and things, but in a static way
[13:02:34] <FishPencil> robertmaxrees: sounds good, what can do that?
[13:02:57] <robertmaxrees> there are dozens.  depends on the platform you're using and what you're comfortable working with.
[13:03:04] <robertmaxrees> jekyll is a popular one.
[13:03:27] <FishPencil> whatever's popular and an industry standard
[13:03:35] <robertmaxrees> there's no "industry standard" really.
[13:03:44] <taplar> geri: those two keys don't seem to close the modal for me
[13:03:55] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil lots of different platforms to support and whatnot :)
[13:04:06] <geri> taplar: here they cose the dialog.
[13:04:14] <geri> taplar: i use google chrome
[13:04:15] <FishPencil> robertmaxrees: A few common ones would do
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> start with jekyll
[13:04:39] <geri> taplar: assuming the button is focused, is that the case?
[13:04:50] <taplar> oh
[13:04:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, a quick google search will turn up whatever the cool kids are using these days.
[13:04:53] <taplar> heh
[13:04:59] <taplar> why would you want to stop that?
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> geri you don't want to stop that.
[13:05:40] <geri> robertmaxrees: i want to stop that because i run a simulation before the dialog pops up... in the simulation the user uses the spacebar and enter keys!!
[13:06:00] <taplar> so why are you focusing on the button?
[13:06:04] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[13:06:23] <geri> taplar: its focused by default!
[13:06:29] <taplar> so....
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> that sounds weird.  i'd fix that problem.
[13:07:17] <geri> robertmaxrees: what do you mean?
[13:07:26] <taplar> focus on the first input field on modal open
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:07:36] <robertmaxrees> that'll fix your problem and give you far better UX.
[13:07:48] <taplar> yeah, don't change expected ui behavior
[13:07:57] <taplar> leads to wtf moments
[13:08:05] <geri> taplar: chaning the default focus in the dialog?
[13:08:09] <geri> changing
[13:08:27] <taplar> depending on your dialog there should be an event that happens on modal open
[13:08:34] <taplar> in side there, find the first input, and focus on it
[13:08:58] <taplar> maybe not an event, persay, but a callback.  what are you using, jquery ui?
[13:09:13] <geri> taplar: jquery ui
[13:09:47] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[13:10:29] <shoky> geri:  put autofocus attribute on the first input
[13:11:03] <geri>  open: function(event, ui) {     	$(this).parent().focus(); ?
[13:11:20] <shoky> geri:   <input id="userId" name="userId" autofocus>
[13:11:22] <taplar> shoky may be having a better idea
[13:12:22] <shoky> and if you really wanetd to prevent the keypress btw then you could add this to the Ok button options:  keydown: function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }
[13:13:33] <geri> shoky: does that also work if you only use labels instead of input?
[13:13:42] <taplar> just be aware your probably going to frustrate your users that are big keyboard users
[13:14:04] <geri> shoky: does the autofocus also work if you only use labels instead of input?
[13:14:20] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:14:27] <robertmaxrees> that sentence doesn't make sense.
[13:14:29] <robertmaxrees> you have inputs.
[13:14:45] <shoky> and if it makes sense to you, just try it :)
[13:15:09] <taplar> you should try it, but your probably going to have to manually put a tabindex="" on the label
[13:15:22] <taplar> if that is indeed what you want
[13:16:28] <taplar> btw, when you say simulation you talking about a functional test?
[13:17:08] <shoky> didn't sound like it
[13:17:19] * taplar is curious now
[13:21:55] <geri> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/3k61a48g/1/
[13:21:59] <Texan> anyone familiar with jqwidgets? i have a fileuploader and want to have an image in leui of a browse button
[13:25:45] <taplar> geri: how is that realistic?
[13:25:54] <taplar> your going to have a dialog that the user can't do anything with?
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be using labels in that case.
[13:26:12] <geri> taplar: it would only show stats
[13:26:36] <taplar> ok, so then why stop them from hitting enter on the ok?
[13:26:49] <taplar> you pop it up, i see the stuff, i hit enter..... nothing happens.  wtf?
[13:26:49] <shoky> geri: you can put tabindex: -1   on the button.. but then it auto focuses the X button :D
[13:26:56] <geri> taplar: yes: enter + spacebar
[13:27:30] <shoky> why the hell would they focus the close button :\
[13:28:25] <shoky> taplar: as he said, users are pressing enter + spacebar right before it pops up,  i guess
[13:28:33] <geri> shoky: correct.
[13:28:51] <taplar> ok..
[13:30:23] <taplar> crap, where do you get the link to see just the result page for jsfiddle?
[13:30:54] <shoky> i always forget
[13:31:03] <geri> taplar: go to embedd -> result
[13:31:27] <shoky> geri  anyways worst case you can do what i suggested with keydown i suppose
[13:36:04] <shoky> geri: oh you can focus non input elements if you append the html before the open
[13:37:29] <shoky> geri: https://jsfiddle.net/3k61a48g/5/
[13:37:44] <shoky> without tabindex it doesn't even look focused
[13:37:56] <shoky> should check on other browsers prolly
[13:38:09] <shoky> possibly needs tabindex="1"  to be safe
[13:44:47] <taplar> mmm, the big problem with the world.  everyone has issues with dialog
[13:45:25] <Solarlux> Where i can download jquery refference?
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> Solarlux you mean the api documentation?
[13:46:01] <robertmaxrees> You could download the site via the gh repo.
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> and run it locally maybe?>
[13:46:17] <Solarlux> How?
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> check out the repo.  there should be instructions there.
[13:46:43] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just one idea.
[13:46:47] <geri> shoky: cool!
[14:42:47] <no_its_just_a_pi> Whats the best way to catch changes made in a textarea via typing or paste?
[14:43:07] <no_its_just_a_pi> right now I have $j("#commentsMaxLength").bind("input propertychange", function(e) { alert('hi'); }); but it's not working
[15:00:52] <NoiseEee> what guide/documentation are you looking at that suggests .bind() ?!
[15:03:06] <arc_> $j is also pretty weird
[15:06:15] <arc_> no_its_just_a_pi https://jsfiddle.net/ag59bxsj/
[16:12:10] <T4nk5bb0t> Hello, has anyone had experience with both vis.js and plot.ly?
[16:25:30] <Sagar> is there any angularjs minifer or obfuscator?
[17:21:58] <taplar> angularjs is already obfuscated.  oooohhhhh!
[17:22:05] <taplar> late to the show, :(
[17:23:18] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:38:53] <liveon> right now I have jQuery('input.comments').bind('input propertychange', function() {}); but I need it to use 'on' since the element can be dynamically added to the page, any way>
[17:39:06] <robertmaxrees> event delegation :)
[17:39:12] <robertmaxrees> bind to a parent that exists on pagelaod.
[17:39:16] <robertmaxrees> and pass the second argument.
[17:40:34] <liveon> robertmaxrees: Can I bind to...body?
[17:40:43] <robertmaxrees> sure, though I'd bind as low as you can.
[17:40:46] <liveon> it's on a stupid salesforce page
[17:40:55] <liveon> i havew no clue what it's doing in the background, but it re-renders a chunk of the page
[17:40:57] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events explains it in good detail.
[17:42:10] <liveon> robertmaxrees: I'm a little confused how to use the two of these together
[17:42:17] <robertmaxrees> the two of what together?
[17:42:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't use .bind() any more.
[17:42:29] <robertmaxrees> you'd swap to just the new .on() syntax.
[17:42:32] <liveon> oh
[17:42:41] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('events', 'child', function() {});
[17:44:29] <liveon> robertmaxrees: jQuery("body").on('input propertychange', 'input.comments', function(e) {}); ?
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:45:05] <liveon> robertmaxrees: there we go, thanks
[17:45:25] <liveon> Is there any way to see if the contents of something has changed via other scripts?
[17:45:50] <liveon> salesforce is doing a re-render of a portion of the page, and when it does so I need to run a js function, but they have no hooks
[17:47:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it exists, but I would avoid it if al all possible.
[18:21:23] <rolandschutz> Any idea why this is not working on iPhone 6?
[18:21:56] <rolandschutz> $(’#aa’).css('min-height', '0')
[18:22:13] <robertmaxrees> should work fine.  you have any other styles overriding or anything?
[18:22:39] <rolandschutz> After executing the safari developer tools still show the old value
[18:22:47] <rolandschutz> or no value, is there was no value before
[18:22:54] <rolandschutz> on chrome it works
[18:24:35] <robertmaxrees> try 0px
[18:25:18] <rolandschutz> did, nothing
[18:25:30] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  could be lots of things.
[18:25:37] <rolandschutz> Also tried other values like ‚20px‘ oder ‚10px !important‘
[18:30:32] <rolandschutz> This still returns the old value:
[18:30:33] <rolandschutz> listEl.css('min-height', '30px');
[18:30:33] <rolandschutz> listEl.css('min-height')
[18:30:54] <robertmaxrees> then something else must be happening.
[18:30:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[18:31:02] <taplar> have you tried css('minHeight', '') ?
[18:32:02] <robertmaxrees> could give that a shot.
[18:32:41] <robertmaxrees> what are you getting back, out of curiosity?
[18:33:36] <rolandschutz> „70px“ for the css min-height:70px !important
[18:33:53] <rolandschutz> ‚minHeight‘ has no effect
[18:33:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:33:58] <robertmaxrees> so it's working?
[18:33:59] <robertmaxrees> ooor....?
[18:36:27] <rolandschutz> No, it’s still not working
[18:36:42] <robertmaxrees> you said "<rolandschutz> „70px“ for the css min-height:70px !important" so i thought it was for a second.
[18:36:57] <robertmaxrees> so what are you putting in and what are you getting out?
[18:36:58] <rolandschutz> that was the css, not the jquery..
[18:46:06] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:02:49] <taplar> dang, so i may be staying up here a while, lol
[19:03:00] <taplar> wind just opened on of our side doors
[19:03:01] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah?

[19:04:09] <robertmaxrees> wow./
[19:04:11] <robertmaxrees> not a good day.

[19:17:15] <robertmaxrees> israel
[19:17:41] <taplar> hmm, i dunno if i can find a doppler for over there this size
[19:18:10] <shoky> i'll resume melting then
[19:18:32] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[19:18:35] <robertmaxrees> nice humidity bro.
[19:18:49] <taplar> lol, i dunno how to interpret that
[19:19:04] <taplar> this one actually says on it, "Radar stopped (no significant weather)"
[19:19:10] <shoky> lol
[19:19:15] <robertmaxrees> he's at 86 f, but like 79% humidity
[19:19:16] <robertmaxrees> wow.
[19:19:18] <robertmaxrees> eff that noise
[19:19:43] <robertmaxrees> we're peaking from 95 to like 105 but our humidity is low.
[19:19:44] <taplar> so we are humidity pals then, :D
[19:20:17] <shoky> you @ arkansas?
[19:20:20] <taplar> yeah
[19:20:50] <shoky> eek hot tornado
[19:21:42] <taplar> not a good sign when the weather moves south east, ^_^
[19:22:18] <taplar> usually it's NW for us.  otherwise, shit is going down
[19:22:32] <taplar> not sure why
[19:22:41] <robertmaxrees> i went through a tornado warning once in michigan.
[19:22:48] <robertmaxrees> that was... interesting.
[19:22:57] <taplar> sirens and everything?
[19:23:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:23:25] <taplar> we don't have the sirens yet.  just had that annoying phone text earlier that rolled slowly over the office
[19:25:04] <robertmaxrees> dizzam son
[19:26:52] <taplar> just got a text one guy is seeing hail. yay
[19:27:47] <taplar> it was a thursday when jquery witnessed a guy talking nonchalantly about a potential natural disaster
[19:31:17] <taplar> btw you should ask robert about that shoky
[19:31:35] <robertmaxrees> about whatnow?
[19:31:38] <taplar> rob, what is your understanding of 'lead development'
[19:31:53] <robertmaxrees> As opposed to cobolt development?
[19:31:54] <robertmaxrees> BOOM
[19:31:59] <taplar> lol
[19:32:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean, like, what it means to be a lead developer?
[19:32:27] <taplar> no, actually 'lead development'.  shoky has some (potential) job he's going to do that might involve it
[19:32:39] <taplar> from my googling it kinda looked like business intelligence stuff
[19:32:45] <robertmaxrees> oooh like sales leads.
[19:32:52] <taplar> seems like it
[19:33:10] <robertmaxrees> that's a whole industry.  crazy stuff.
[19:36:09] <shoky> ah i think they just meant that these pages will contain some forms for potential users (leads) to enter their details in, maybe it will subscribe them to some mailing list (they mentioned mailchimp) and i guess maybe it will also enter the details into their CRM or BI or whatever system (think he also mentioned salesforce)
[19:36:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:36:22] <shoky> at least thats what i understood after reading some
[19:36:30] <robertmaxrees> pretty common stuff.  salesforce is a pita.
[19:36:38] <shoky> dang
[19:37:01] <shoky> hopefully it'll require the most basic integration
[19:39:28] <shoky> you got experience with that stuff robert?
[19:50:46] <Aljone> hello anyone knows any plugin for accessibility , to control fontszie and stuff ?
[19:51:18] <robertmaxrees> "and stuff"?
[19:52:05] <Aljone> site color, font-size and so on.. for disable ppl
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> that's going to require more than just a plugin.
[19:53:19] <Aljone> did u hear about a lib or plugin like that?
[19:54:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that doing it correctly would requiree more than a plugin
[19:54:21] <Aljone> why u think so?
[19:54:32] <Aljone> i think u can do it all from plugin that contain all those features
[19:54:37] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[19:54:55] <robertmaxrees> because how would it know every little thing yourr site's doing, what to account for, your plugins, etc.
[19:55:07] <robertmaxrees> doing it correctly is a pain.
[19:55:31] <Aljone> i mean must be a way for example to get font bigger by 1 or something
[19:55:39] <Aljone> and change some colors in the theme
[19:55:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not accessibility fwiw.
[19:55:47] <robertmaxrees> you could build that for your own site though.
[19:56:29] <Aljone> can i show u somethng on pm?
[19:56:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you sent it to the channel :)
[19:56:44] <Aljone> http://www.s-wear.co.il/
[19:56:53] <Aljone> u see the left disablility icon
[19:56:57] <Aljone> from there u can control things
[19:57:00] <Aljone> i want to make it like that
[19:57:22] <robertmaxrees> nop.e
[19:57:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't see it.
[19:57:46] <Aljone> look carefuly u will see "disabled person icon"
[19:57:50] <robertmaxrees> where?
[19:57:59] <robertmaxrees> becuase i don't see it?
[19:58:01] <Aljone> on the top left side
[19:58:10] <Aljone> its fixed and move with u when u scroll the page
[19:58:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:58:24] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[19:58:32] <Aljone> hmm
[19:59:23] <robertmaxrees> i get redirected when i hit the url you sent fwiw.
[20:00:13] <Aljone> redirected to where?
[20:00:23] <robertmaxrees> http://www.s-wear.com/
[20:01:06] <Aljone> hmm weird
[20:01:16] <robertmaxrees> probably geolocating.
[20:01:17] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[20:01:17] <Aljone> make cuz u're not local it redirect to another website
[20:01:29] <shoky> i'm local and it redirects me as well :P
[20:01:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:03:05] <Aljone> ok ask it other way arround, htere is a way to make font grow by "1" for example
[20:03:23] <Aljone> so if i have 2 divs , one size 14 and one 16 it will become 15 and 17
[20:03:31] <robertmaxrees> sure, though it'll be slow.
[20:03:43] <Aljone> without checking each element
[20:03:53] <robertmaxrees> also: users can increase/decrease the size of the page with their browser.
[20:04:02] <Aljone> can i access that from js?
[20:04:07] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[20:04:12] <robertmaxrees> they already have it.  if they need it, they can use it :)
[20:04:22] <Aljone> but i want to make it from js action
[20:04:25] <robertmaxrees> why?
[20:04:33] <Aljone> cuz not all know how to do it
[20:04:43] <Aljone> can i acccess it from action?
[20:04:46] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:04:48] <Aljone> damn
[20:04:57] <robertmaxrees> link them to instructions on how to do so.
[20:05:05] <robertmaxrees> also, have to removed the need to use a mouse while browsing?
[20:05:12] <robertmaxrees> and taken care of all contrast on your site?
[20:05:31] <Aljone> hmm
[20:47:03] <Aljone> $j(".opc-wrapper-opc").find("#opc-co-shipping-method-form input").prop("checked").length
[20:47:07] <Aljone> why this isnt working
[20:48:13] <Aljone> i have few inputs there
[20:52:17] <Aljone> found
[22:37:47] <jose3_> I have a dumb question ...
[22:37:57] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/H3VzqBL4/
[22:38:07] <jose3_> is this normal javascript syntax?
[22:38:23] <jose3_> This line confuses me: if (c == 0 || c == leds.length - 1) d = -d;
[22:44:52] <systemfault> What's confusing?
[22:45:35] <systemfault> if c is equal to zero or c is equal to the length of leds minus 1 then d is equal to its negation
