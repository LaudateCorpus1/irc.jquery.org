[00:00:03] <Cork> so ya, i've been on the websocket horse since hybi07
[00:00:03] <failwell> nice.. i have a finished project in websockets here.. didn't publish because of all the browser troubles.
[00:00:29] <failwell> teitoklein01: long polling keeps an http connection open
[00:00:31] <Cork> failwell: and websocket has worked fine fince ~2011
[00:00:45] <Cork> failwell: no pref for mozilla since hidie76
[00:01:02] <Cork> but ya ie neeed a fallback
[00:01:20] <Cork> now days we actually think of dropping the fallback
[00:01:30] <failwell> ok, thx. i can publish without old ie support.. not my problem.
[00:01:59] <Cork> failwell: the fallback is a websocket > comet proxy server
[00:02:25] <Cork> and it has to be on the same domain as the site cause of ie's silly XDomain thingy
[00:02:27] <failwell> may i ask which webserver you are using? is the comet doing the websocket proxy?
[00:02:43] <Cork> go
[00:03:06] <Cork> ?g gorilla websocket
[00:03:07] <b-ot> Cork: gorilla/websocket · GitHub → https://github.com/gorilla/websocket
[00:03:24] <failwell> i use an nginx proxy setup.. it works fine - but i got no fallback. i really don't like long polling.. i'll look into gorilla..
[00:03:30] <Cork> so we have a go server and the normal site behind nginx
[00:03:47] <Cork> and the go server handles the sessions and buffering and all that
[00:04:41] <failwell> hehe.. nice to meet someone else using websockets. :D
[00:04:58] <Cork> well we used long polling on an older version of the site
[00:05:12] <Cork> but it's annoying when you need to push info out
[00:05:24] <teitoklein01> can I use this for a starter? http://jwebsocket.org/documentation/reference-guide/jQuery-Integration
[00:05:32] <failwell> yeah.. it was and still is common.. but for my application it still lacks of speed.
[00:06:12] <Cork> teitoklein01: honestly, start with refactoring the sync parts
[00:06:27] <Cork> teitoklein01: after that you can switch between ajax and websocket without too much work
[00:06:44] <teitoklein01> ah yeah, that thing. okay I better start it right now first. brb. thanks Cork
[00:07:29] <Cork> failwell: i even have a compatibility lib that uses ajax polls if websocket doesn't exist :)
[00:07:53] <Cork> it was fun writing until i needed to push data from ie
[00:08:07] <Cork> then i went kinda.. "what the f****"
[00:08:08] <Cork> XD
[00:08:34] <Cork> there XDomainRequest has to be the most annoying solution i've seen
[00:08:48] <Cork> (and insecure)

[01:14:56] <JustMozzy> hola. in jcarousel I am trying to configure my previous and next buttons, however when calling .jcarouselControl I get the error "undefined is not a function" any ideas?

[01:31:17] <mochabcha> how do you check if 'element' is an array?  Typeof returns an 'object' and element.isArray == true (or false) always returns false because element.isArray itself returns undefined.
[01:31:48] <Cork> mochabcha: is "element" a jquery object or what?
[01:33:07] <mochabcha> its an array of jquery objects
[01:33:33] <mochabcha> element[0] contains the $('body')
[01:33:49] <mochabcha> element[1] contains a $('.certain-class')
[01:34:03] <Cork> mochabcha: why are you doing it like that?
[01:34:17] <Cork> mochabcha: jquery objects hold multiple elements by default
[01:34:23] <Cork> just add to the one you have with .add
[01:36:48] <mochabcha> ok I'm testing this your way now....didn't know about .add...much thankyous
[01:37:06] <Cork> mochabcha: one note though
[01:37:12] <Cork> you need to store what .add returns
[01:37:21] <Cork> it doesn't modify the original object
[01:37:29] <Cork> list = list.add(something)
[01:37:34] <mochabcha> cork: right
[01:37:39] <mochabcha> thats what i figured
[01:37:50] <Cork> that bit me the first time i used it :)
[01:39:31] <mochabcha> ur the best @cork
[01:53:11] <mochabcha> whats the best way to power through an "unexpected end of input" problem? I'm quite stuck on this one as everything looks pretty closed. http://pastebin.com/6tQPpPcq
[01:54:54] <Patvil> hrrm my script will only fire once on the site, but works in jsfiddle...
[01:55:12] <Patvil> trying to bind a click() event to radio buttons
[01:55:52] <mochabcha> i think you bind .change() events to radio buttons...
[01:56:08] <Patvil> aah i'll try
[01:57:03] <dan2k3k4> hmm, so I have a slider (bxSlider) that I want to change for different pages, I already have a function to replace the html of the slider using ajax calls
[01:57:20] <dan2k3k4> however I need to re-initialise the slider (or destory the old one and re-add the new one) ?
[01:57:32] <Patvil> still only fires the first time I click a new button
[01:57:44] <Patvil> http://jsfiddle.net/xyQ5P/13/
[02:04:04] <mochabcha> Patvil: Its firing just fine http://jsfiddle.net/xyQ5P/15/, but the conditional that checks window.location.pathname isn't true.
[02:04:19] <mochabcha> commenting it out makes it work just fine
[02:04:58] <Patvil> hrm, but for me it works fine in jsfiddle..
[02:06:00] <Patvil> aah you get a different pathname for some reason...
[02:06:11] <mochabcha> well jsfiddle happens in iframes
[02:06:35] <mochabcha> so window.location.pathname will not contain a "/_display/"
[02:07:06] <Patvil> it does in my first window actually... that's what pops out in the alert box
[02:07:33] <Patvil> but anyhow, on the actual site I know that the pathname will be /checkout
[02:07:58] <Patvil> any idea on why it's not working there?
[02:09:15] <mochabcha> you should probably check if window.location.pathname.indexOf("/_display/") >= 0
[02:09:41] <mochabcha> and pathnames contain a trailing slash i believe
[02:09:57] <mochabcha> try '/checkout/'
[02:10:30] <Patvil> but it fires once, shouldnt that mean that the conditinal is true?
[02:11:01] <murosai> what's the difference of using var x = function() vs function x()
[02:12:38] <Patvil> no change with /checkout/ still only once
[02:12:40] <mochabcha> Patvil: well it depends on what you already have in the path.  it could have been true at some point.  But if widen the specificity of your conditional you will inevitably cover more unexpected mishaps
[02:12:57] <systemfault> murosai: The first one is assigning an unamed function to x.. the second creates a function having a name of x.
[02:13:50] <Patvil> using /checkout or /checkout/ now
[02:14:00] <mochabcha> also try using on('click'
[02:14:06] <mochabcha> thats why its only happening once
[02:15:29] <mochabcha> $("input").on('click', function(){ ...
[02:16:25] <Patvil> hrrm never seen that before, will try
[02:17:20] <mochabcha> whats the best way to power through an "unexpected end of input" problem? I'm quite stuck on this one as everything looks pretty closed. http://pastebin.com/6tQPpPcq
[02:17:43] <murosai> systemfault: the effect is the same?
[02:18:10] <systemfault> murosai: Yes, named functions have one advantage though… easier to debug.
[02:19:02] <systemfault> murosai: BTW.. this is also valid: var x = function y() {};
[02:19:04] <Patvil> :( still only once with the .on()
[02:19:18] <Patvil> maibe there is something else blocking it on the site...
[02:19:28] <murosai> systemfault: how is it easier to debug?
[02:19:47] <systemfault> murosai: Because you can see the name of the function instead of just being “closure”
[02:20:19] <murosai> so why would you ever want to use the var x = function() form?
[02:20:20] <mochabcha> Patvil: then logically the conditional is changing.  I'd have to see all the code to debug that.
[02:26:33] <systemfault> murosai: http://kangax.github.io/nfe/#names-in-debuggers
[02:43:55] <Radditz> hello
[02:44:06] <Radditz> if I change the ccss of the html element, by setting overflow to hidden
[02:44:11] <Radditz> will it work after the page is loaded?
[02:44:42] <gingitsune> Hey, is there a way to get a hold of legacy jquery ui docs?
[02:44:45] <Wizek> Good Morning!
[02:45:43] <Wizek> I'd like to use the `:visible` pseudo selector, but witout the check wheter the element is attached to the main dom or detached. Can I do that without writing my own selector?
[02:58:39] <CrowX-> the following line works without problem:
[02:58:40] <CrowX-> $(element).css({width: ($("#content").width() - $('.press').width() - parseInt($('.press').css('margin-left'), 10) - parseInt($('.press').css('margin-right'), 10) - parseInt($('.press').css('margin'), 10) - 5 + 'px'), height: 'auto'});
[02:59:01] <CrowX-> so adding or substracting values works
[02:59:12] <CrowX-> but when I try to multiply it, it ignores the whole line
[02:59:18] <CrowX-> i.e. if I change the line to:
[02:59:25] <CrowX-> $(element).css({width: 1 * ($("#content").width() - $('.press').width() - parseInt($('.press').css('margin-left'), 10) - parseInt($('.press').css('margin-right'), 10) - parseInt($('.press').css('margin'), 10) - 5 + 'px'), height: 'auto'});
[02:59:40] <CrowX-> ^notice I multiplied the width by 1.
[03:00:03] <CrowX-> how can I use multiplication in cases like this?
[03:01:04] <dan2k3k4> hmm updated bxslider but still need to figure out how to 'reload' bxsliders if the whole html content has changed with ajax...
[03:02:15] <gingitsune> how can i check the value that has been passed to jquery ui autocomplete widget?
[03:02:46] <dan2k3k4> I initialise the slider like: slider_banner2 = $('#page_slideshow_banner2').show().bxSlider({OPTIONS}); -> but I have 3 sliders, 2 that appear on one page, and 1 that appears on another page (replaces the two first sliders)
[03:03:32] <dan2k3k4> but $('#page_slideshow_banner2') would be empty if it's on the page with 1 slider (slideshow_full)... so slider_banner2 is never set as a bxSlider? :/
[03:07:03] <CrowX-> nevermind, I was trying to multiply the value with 'px' in it :)
[03:18:54] <dan2k3k4> I guess I need a function for my bxSlider options
[04:32:14] <ronny> hi
[04:33:43] <ronny> anyone aware fo a simple lib thtat helps showing/hiding/changing dom elements based on data received via ajax/event streams, i find myself repeating code to do that
[04:43:03] <iamntz> ronny, do you have control over received data?
[04:43:17] <ronny> iamntz: yes
[04:43:50] <iamntz> even is a tight coupling, you may send some extra data, like ID's of elements that needs to be updated
[04:44:38] <iamntz> and if you sent data like { element: '#foo', data : 'bar' }, then you can have, on ajax callback, something like: $( response.element ).html( response.data )
[04:45:25] <iamntz> but again, this is a very thight coupling, not a good idea on medium-large projects
[04:46:24] <ronny> hmm, true
[04:46:54] <ronny> iamntz: im kind of hoping for some angualr data bind style of thing, where icann show elements based on data
[04:47:24] <iamntz> i was thinking you are searching for something like that :)
[04:48:08] <iamntz> in the same way, you could send an „event” name in response that is triggered on completion
[04:48:52] <iamntz> and then in html you set something like <div data-respond-to="update:user-count">
[04:49:19] <iamntz> and in js you do $(document).on('update:user-count', '[data-respond-to]', doSomething)
[04:49:46] <iamntz> (and obviously, in response data you send the update:user-count event name)
[04:50:14] <iamntz> dunno if it make sense, but i guess is the quickest way to deal with angular-like functionality
[04:50:38] <ronny> sounds hackishunfamiliar
[04:51:11] <iamntz> well, you kind of want something hackish :)
[04:52:19] <Cork> the cleanest is prob to use a templating solution
[04:52:47] <Cork> and then you can let the template control what happens
[04:53:19] <JustMozzy> Anyone knows how I can get the visisble element in jcarousel? the method described in the docs throws an error (undefined is not a function)
[04:53:52] <iamntz> Cork, templating doesn't quite deals with showing/hiding/changing tho
[04:54:06] <Cork> iamntz: not showing hiding, but changing
[04:54:54] <Cork> but adding this kinda of rules is simple enough if your ok with changing the structure of the json
[04:58:49] <mattyh88> hi, does anyone know of any jquery library to set some text inside a textbox as bold? e.g. I have the text "Extremely important" inside a textbox, but I would like to set "important" in bold. I could use an RTE but I find that a little to much for my needs
[04:59:32] <Cork> mattyh88: that isn't possible
[04:59:58] <mattyh88> Cork: I was afraid so :(
[04:59:59] <Cork> you need to use a wysiwyg editor to do that
[05:00:15] <Cork> or a contentEditable element if you want to go low level
[05:00:23] <mattyh88> Cork: pitty .. but okay thx
[05:13:01] <krambiorix> in a dialog i change widths and heights of tables... Is there a way of resetting all those changes?
[05:13:26] <Cork> krambiorix: of tables?
[05:13:38] <Cork> your using resizable or something?
[05:14:50] <krambiorix> Cork, of tables and divs and table tr/td 's .. I use css() and height() and width()
[05:14:56] <krambiorix> nothing more
[05:15:18] <Cork> krambiorix: use css() to set the values to an invalid number and it gets removed
[05:15:23] <Cork> '' is normally a good value
[05:15:28] <Cork> css('width', '
[05:15:33] <Cork> * css('width', '')
[05:19:33] <krambiorix> Cork,  thanks mate!
[05:21:00] <surial> I'm doing some canvas work. I want a mouseover handler where mousing over the top left pixel of the canvas gets me 0, 0 as coordinate. I currently use evt.pageX - canvasElem.offset().left. This does NOT work. What am I doing wrong (I'm 20 too far in for x, and -80 on y, if I'm on the top left). The canvas has zero padding, and 16px of margin on the left and top.
[05:23:11] <surial> I can simplify my question considerably: offset() appears to be broken(). Can someone explain to me how it works?
[05:23:33] <t432> The following json query "$.getJSON("/secure/all/",function(data){console.log(data);});" gives me a "500 (internal server error) ", What could be the problem?
[05:23:43] <Cork> surfdue: you might be looking for .position()
[05:24:11] <Port3M5[Work]> t432, The server side code generating the response could be erroring out?
[05:24:17] <t432>  The call seems to trigger the server side methods (prints out rhe content in console that should be returned)
[05:24:36] <Cork> surfdue: offset() gives you the position offset to the document; position() gives you the offset to the offsetParent()
[05:24:47] <ronny> when having the id of an element, is there a way to get it other than $("#" + theid) ?
[05:25:21] <Cork> ronny: $(document.getElementById(theid)) ?
[05:25:31] <Cork> ronny: joke a side, no that is the way you do it
[05:26:06] <surial> Cork: when I'm scrolled all the way to the origin, and I call .offset() on a <canvas> tag, I get an entirely wrong answer.
[05:26:17] <surial> The y is 80 too large, an the x is 20 too little.
[05:26:45] <surial> Cork: And as .pageX and .pageY are also relative to the document, I definitely want offset(). But I prefer an offset() that actually does what it says. Am I missing something? Does offset() not work for floated elements?
[05:26:47] <Cork> hmm
[05:27:15] <Cork> surial: you might be hitting a browser bug, donno
[05:27:19] <Cork> do you have an example?
[05:27:36] <Cork> (and have you tested in multiple browsers? )
[05:27:42] <ronny> Cork: k
[05:27:45] <surial> Eh... testcase. Good idea. What I have is a bit clogged with irrelevant data. I'll test firefox right now; I was on the latest chrome.
[05:28:49] <surial> Cork: Equally broken in firefox.
[05:29:00] <surial> That suggests it's a jquery bug.
[05:29:11] <Cork> surial: or in your code
[05:29:19] <Cork> surial: make a testcase and will see
[05:29:24] <surial> No, I just call .offset() and print the results. Then I use a screen measurement tool.
[05:29:27] <surial> And the numbers aren't even remotely close.
[05:30:39] <Cork> surial: never be sure before you've made a testcase to test your thesis
[05:30:55] <surial> I'll put it on the agenda, I'm on a tight deadline so I'm going to have to hack around it for today.
[05:31:00] <surial> Sorry, that's not fair to jquery dev team, I know.
[05:31:01] <Cork> it is very easy to be sure, and it might be something in the over page you missed
[05:31:20] <surial> How? I literally just go $(function() { console.log($("#foo").offset(); }), and the answer is wrong.
[05:31:25] <Cork> surial: just speaking from my own experience :)
[05:33:53] <JustMozzy> Does anyone know of a way to check if an element is visible in the context of a parent that has a hidden overflow?
[05:34:13] <ankurk_> JustMozzy: .is(':visible')
[05:34:17] <Cork> no
[05:34:34] <Cork> JustMozzy: ugg, you need to grab the position().top and left of the element
[05:35:03] <JustMozzy> Cork: thanks
[05:35:05] <Cork> and check if it is < 0 or > parent width/height
[05:36:27] <surial> Cork: evt.offsetX and evt.offsetY, while not documented, work out of the box. At least, on chrome and firefox.
[05:36:44] <surial> crud. nope, false alarm. Not supported on firefox. sigh.
[05:37:18] <surial> Can I make a strong feature suggestion somewhere for jquery? It seems to be extremely obvious to want the x/y coordinate relative to the thing you put a mousemove listener on. Even if .offset() wasn't broken, you ahve to do a bunch of crazy math right now. Seems very silly.
[05:38:33] <Cork> surial: try clientX and clientY
[05:38:40] <failwell> Did you also think of, that your users may use smartphones or tablets, where there is no mouse cursor?
[05:38:41] <Cork> i think those should be local to the element
[05:38:43] <surial> Cork: Also the wrong values.
[05:38:46] <surial> they aren't local.
[05:38:51] <surial> they are local to the client window scroll.
[05:39:03] <surial> so, equal to pageX and pageY if scrolled to origin, smaller if you've scrolled the document down or right.
[05:41:16] <failwell> may i ask what you are trying to do, surial? what's the purpose for calculating pixel precise outside of the current viewport?
[05:41:23] <surial> canvas.
[05:41:39] <failwell> but you are always inside your canvas, right?
[05:41:50] <surial> Sure. Exactly.
[05:42:05] <surial> If I am mosued over pixel let's say 200, 300, as measured from the top left of the canvas, I wanna know the values '200' and '300'.
[05:42:16] <surial> I can't really imagine anything other than that being useful at all for canvas stuff.
[05:42:33] <surial> For example, let's say I want a canvas where there's a circular blob around your mouse cursor as you move over it.
[05:42:39] <failwell> tried this one?
[05:42:39] <failwell> http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/advanced/html5-canvas-mouse-coordinates/
[05:42:48] <surial> I think I figured it out. This hacky monstrosity: 		var x = (evt.offsetX === undefined) ? evt.clientX - $(evt.target).offset().left : evt.offsetX;
[05:43:21] <failwell> i mean: thats no stuff thats entirely new. there are tutorials out there.
[05:43:33] <surial> It should be evt.pageX - canvasElem.offset().left. That's what the jquery docs suggest. But that doesn't work.
[05:43:44] <surial> I'll create a nice testcase and all that later this week. No time today unfortunately.
[05:44:17] <failwell> good luck. :D

[05:51:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/E2ZY7/3/
[05:52:18] <apt-get_install> Hi, I 'm quite new to jQuery. I would like to have a function that looks for a certain div with a certain class value and deletes it when it appears.
[05:52:35] <fRAiLtY-> Cheers Cork
[05:52:54] <fRAiLtY-> I’m guessing closest() doesn’t traverse upwards and within in this instance?
[05:53:10] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it travels upwards in the parent tree structure
[05:53:19] <Cork> not parent siblings children structure :)
[05:53:30] <fRAiLtY-> So it would ignore the dt completely as it’s in the same area as the dd right?
[05:54:03] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the code expects the dt to be the sibling directly before dd
[05:54:26] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: if you need more flexibility you can use something like .prevAll('dt').first()
[05:55:11] <fRAiLtY-> Gotcha, thanks
[06:16:01] <stormelc> hey guys. I have a div called "dataFeed" and I want to select ever child with the class "pinnedPost". How would I do that?
[06:16:44] <stormelc> with id "dataFeed"*
[06:17:22] <m4ggus> $('#dataFeed').find('.pinnedPost') would be a way
[06:18:46] <Cork> or just $('#dataFeed .pinnedPost')
[06:19:13] <Cork> or $('#dataFeed > .pinnedPost') if you just want direct children
[06:25:38] <abishek> quite sometime back the dynamic event binding was change from the `live` function to `on`. This works for buttons, but how to implement the same for dropdowns? I need to dynamically bind change event for dropdown
[06:28:46] <failwell> use change: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[06:31:53] <NoiseEee> abishek: same way
[06:32:22] <NoiseEee> abishek: $(someSelectElement).on('change',function() { //blah });
[06:32:37] <abishek> NoiseEee, yes, i was able to figure out. I had an issue on the item that I was trying to find it on $(someElement)
[06:33:23] <abishek> $(someElement) needs to exist when binding a dynamic event when using the on function `on('change','selector',function(){});
[06:34:04] <NoiseEee> abishek: or you delegate to a parent that's always in the DOM
[06:35:01] <abishek> yes, I figured it out
[06:35:06] <abishek> thnx for the help
[07:07:46] <d0de> what will/should happen if I initialize the object foo{} but the object foo{} already exists and has properties?
[07:08:06] <NoiseEee> how do you 'initialize' the object foo?
[07:08:18] <d0de> as in foo = {}
[07:08:28] <d0de> is initialize the wrong term?
[07:08:46] <NoiseEee> thats fine
[07:08:56] <NoiseEee> anyways it will obviously erase any properties
[07:09:15] <d0de> ok that's fine, thank you!
[07:11:21] <PersonX> how would I go about if I wanted to link a flash .swf file that is on the remote system [I know the absolute path to it] on a webpage that is on a different server [not the remote system]? Basically, there's a website which loads a swf file on it but I've downloaded that .swf file and made a few changes to it and saved it in a certain folder in my system (say, /home/user1/file.swf ) and now I'm trying to change the location variable in the 'object' element
[07:11:21] <PersonX> on that webpage via Developer Tools, but I cannot figure out what should I place as the variable's value instead of its actual value i.e. 'some/folder/file.swf'. Anyway I could do this with jQuery [using the console]?
[07:24:56] <dan2k3k4> right my bxSliders are working a bit better now but still not working right :o
[07:24:59] <dan2k3k4> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23083236/destroy-reload-bxslider-between-ajax-calls
[07:26:24] <dan2k3k4> I destroy all sliders I find, then run the ajax call and load the new slider data, then I try to initialise each slider again that exists in the dom, then I try to 'reload' the sliders that exist
[07:52:58] <bengalo> hey guys, i want to use SSE for keeping the site updated but i dont understand some basics imo. i create the listener in js and send data from my php via stream. but i dont know when / how to update the info within that file. i guess im just going to send updates instead of sending the whole table every time something changes!? how would i actually call/trigger that file from server side? can
[07:52:58] <bengalo> anyone gimme a better explanation on how this works or maybe a working example? appreciate any help
[08:04:03] <dan2k3k4> bah
[08:04:14] <dan2k3k4> this is not working inside a prototype function for another prototype function o_0
[08:05:15] <keady__> anybody here have any use with jquery datatables.js? i'm giving a column a custom sType, but there's an mRender function that returns html, and my sType is getting overridden by the auto-detected html type. any ideas?
[08:05:21] <dan2k3k4> ah oops
[08:05:29] <keady__> even without the custom mRender function, it still gets overwritten with a new type "string"
[08:05:31] <dan2k3k4> it's because the 'this' word is inside success: ()
[08:06:17] <kostiak> hey. I have a function with a variable "a", I change the value of a inside a .done() function after an ajax call but "a" doesn't change outside the done function, what am i missing?
[08:07:30] <kegster> when using .slideDown() how can i keep it in focus?
[08:07:46] <kostiak> anyone?
[08:08:06] <Cork> kostiak: focus shouldn't change cause of slideDown
[08:08:26] <kostiak> Cork: you answered kegster's question :D
[08:08:28] <kostiak> how about mine?
[08:08:38] <Cork> ugg too similar
[08:08:42] <kostiak> :)
[08:08:49] <kegster> kostiak, well when i slideDown, if it goes below the page, the user has to scroll to see it. how can i keep it in focus
[08:09:03] <xunil__> Does it make sense to concatenate all jquery plugins (using whatever means (asset pipeline, etc))?
[08:09:04] <Cork> kegster: though there might be that some browser moves focus when a parent get display: none
[08:09:12] <Cork> ah
[08:09:12] <BinaryKitten> kostiak you'll need to pastebin the code for us to see
[08:09:16] <xunil__> Or serve the plugin separately per page-need?
[08:09:19] <kostiak> BinaryKitten:
[08:09:20] <kostiak> sec
[08:09:31] <Cork> kegster: you would have to adjust the scrollTop of the overflow parent
[08:09:38] <BinaryKitten> kostiak most likely you've a scope issue or that you're trying to access A at the wrong time
[08:09:49] <kostiak> BinaryKitten: that's the basic code: http://pastebin.com/CHYKPaNV
[08:09:57] <Cork> kostiak: you don't have an after from async code
[08:10:02] <kostiak> yeah probably a scope issue, but I can't figure out how to fix it
[08:10:09] <Cork> kostiak: the async callback is always called after everything else
[08:10:17] <BinaryKitten> kostiak yeah a scope issue
[08:10:27] <kostiak> BinaryKitten: so how can i get around it?
[08:10:29] <BinaryKitten> the .done is triggering AFTER the ajax is complete
[08:10:38] <BinaryKitten> you can't return it
[08:10:53] <BinaryKitten> kostiak use a callback?
[08:10:53] <Cork> kostiak: return the promise from ajax and use the .done where you need the data
[08:10:58] <kegster> Cork, ahhhh
[08:11:02] <BinaryKitten> or the promise
[08:11:07] <kostiak> BinaryKitten: callback?
[08:11:35] <kostiak> I want checkUser to return a value based on the data I get in the ajax call, what's the best way to do that?
[08:11:53] <Cork> kostiak: checkUser(something).done(function() { /* existed */ }).fail(function() { /* not found */ })
[08:12:08] <BinaryKitten> kostiak http://pastebin.com/uhBykb5Z
[08:12:13] <Cork> kostiak: you would have to change the server to return a 404 instead of what you do though
[08:12:47] <kostiak> Cork:
[08:12:48] <BinaryKitten> that also allows for Cork's methodology as well
[08:12:52] <kostiak> wait
[08:12:59] <BinaryKitten> lol
[08:13:01] <kostiak> there's no way for checkUser to just return a bool value?
[08:13:06] <Cork> no
[08:13:18] <BinaryKitten> kostiak yes. But not in any way nicely
[08:13:25] <kostiak> :(
[08:13:28] <BinaryKitten> and you have to break lots of other things
[08:13:31] <Cork> kostiak: return means it has to be sync, and network calls isn't sync
[08:13:48] <kostiak> oh
[08:14:07] <kostiak> hmm
[08:14:58] <Cork> kostiak: this is how i would do it http://pastebin.com/RAi1ACu3
[08:15:14] <Cork> and just have the server return 200 or 404 or 406
[08:15:24] <Cork> depending on what you want
[08:16:08] <kostiak> why would the server return any of those? what am i missing? (but yeah thanks for the code, i'll probably do something like that)
[08:16:26] <Cork> kostiak: 200 means check ok
[08:16:37] <Cork> 404 would mean account found (if that is what you want)
[08:16:47] <Cork> and 406 would be invalid password for example
[08:17:04] <kostiak> I actually just return a json..
[08:17:09] <Cork> kostiak: 4xx and 5xx results in the fail callback, that is why you want those
[08:17:12] <kostiak> from the php page
[08:17:23] <Cork> else you would have to have all the logic in .done
[08:17:38] <Cork> though sure you can fix that too
[08:18:45] <kostiak> tbh I don't even know how to get the server to return error codes
[08:18:49] <d0de> is there any problem with having two variables with different names if they're in different non-overlapping scopes?
[08:18:49] <kostiak> just started learning
[08:19:41] <BinaryKitten> d0de no there shouldn't be. Except to create the scope you need to use the var keyword. otherwise it will assume the parent scope until a) it finds the variable - or - b) it hits window
[08:20:52] <Cork> kostiak: http://pastebin.com/qj7T7EKY
[08:20:55] <dan2k3k4> ah finally fixed my code o_0 but it's messy
[08:20:57] <Cork> you can do something like that
[08:21:10] <d0de> BinaryKitten, Ok, thank you. And what happens to a variable with local scope - e.g. inside a named function - when the function finished executing? does it still exist somewhere? is it deleted?
[08:21:17] <dan2k3k4> using stackoverflow questions to talk to yourself helps :o
[08:21:30] <dan2k3k4> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23083236/destroy-reload-bxslider-between-ajax-calls
[08:21:54] <Cork> d0de: the variable is created in that scope
[08:22:09] <Cork> d0de: when the scope isn't referenced from anything the gc will free up the memeory
[08:22:14] <Cork> *memory
[08:22:22] <d0de> Cork, ok, great, thank you
[08:22:35] <BinaryKitten> d0de variables only exist in the scope that they are created in. You can access the scope of parents etc. so a variable created in a function's scope will generally be cleaned up when the function's scope is no longer valid
[08:22:54] <d0de> BinaryKitten, TY
[08:23:14] <kostiak> Cork: oh that's much better
[08:23:21] <kostiak> how does it actually work?
[08:23:49] <Cork> kostiak: checkUser(nameToCheck).done(res) { if(res) {} })
[08:23:53] <Cork> opps
[08:24:00] <Cork> kostiak: checkUser(nameToCheck).done(function(res) { if(res) {} })
[08:24:42] <Cork> hmm actually $.Callbacks is prob what you want in that case
[08:24:46] <Cork> not $.Deferred
[08:25:03] <kostiak> Cork: wait so I can't just do if (checkUser(name) == true) kind of thing with it?
[08:25:13] <Cork> kostiak: you can't ever do that
[08:25:18] <kostiak> :(
[08:25:29] <MiguelSR> Hello, do someone knows some cool plugin to do predictive searchs with JS? I don't want the results inside the dropdown of the select like in typeahead or select2, but need them rendering in the body of my page when i write in the input
[08:25:55] <Cork> kostiak: if(checkUser()) {} would depend on the code stopping at the ajax call
[08:26:10] <Cork> kostiak: and not executing anything until the response comes back from the server
[08:26:22] <kostiak> yeah I'm probably too used to traditional coding and need to get my head around the whole ajax thing :)
[08:26:25] <Cork> kostiak: that would mean nothing would execute, no page redraw or anything
[08:26:54] <duch_kazatel> kostiak just remember, the first letter in AJAX is for "asyncronous"
[08:26:54] <Cork> kostiak: this is normal for anything that does cross threads/processes or over network
[08:27:12] <kostiak> Cork: yeah never did any of those before
[08:27:28] <d0de> a named function created in a child scope will never be accessible in a parent scope, correct?
[08:27:37] <Cork> d0de: correct
[08:27:41] <d0de> Cork, TY
[08:27:52] <Cork> d0de: unless you attach it to an object the parent has access to
[08:28:07] <d0de> Cork, how do you attach functions to objects please?
[08:28:10] <Cork> like ex. (function() { window.a_function = function() {}; })
[08:28:25] <kostiak> anyways, thanks guy
[08:28:27] <kostiak> guys
[08:28:41] <Cork> kostiak: window.<name> = <something>;
[08:28:46] <Cork> makes <name> global
[08:28:52] <d0de> Cork, I see, thank you
[08:29:33] <Cork> d0de: if you have a variable name in the parent scope you can adding the function to it
[08:29:38] <Cork> or if it has an object same thing
[08:30:13] <Cork> js> var a; (function() { a = function() { print("hello") } })(); a()
[08:30:18] <b-ot> Cork: hello
[08:30:41] <duch_kazatel> woah wait we got an REPL now?
[08:32:13] <BillCriswell> What the hell is REPL
[08:32:24] <BillCriswell> I always think of like... Ninjas sliding down buildings.
[08:34:18] <thang_> read eval print loop
[08:34:24] <beancurd> BillCriswell: re.. yeah that
[08:35:34] <BillCriswell> So nothing to do with grappling hooks.
[08:35:49] <beancurd> no :(
[08:36:34] <[1]AlbertSpeer> does anyone know how to fix this?
[08:36:34] <[1]AlbertSpeer> http://jsfiddle.net/CqYrH/19/
[08:36:53] * Cork glues "this" to the wall
[08:37:05] <Cork> [1]AlbertSpeer: explain the problem
[08:37:12] <[1]AlbertSpeer> i need to have the div "show less" switch back to "show more"
[08:37:20] <[1]AlbertSpeer> when i click it agian
[08:37:50] <Cork> [1]AlbertSpeer: simplest is normally to have two child elements and toggle them with a class
[08:37:53] <kostiak> Cork: your way worked, thanks a lot! :)
[08:38:05] <Cork> the plus side of that is that you keep the data in the html
[08:38:11] <Cork> kostiak: nice

[08:58:08] <duch_kazatel> jqser - http://jsfiddle.net/hbjxp/ this is a little better formatted.
[08:59:24] <jqser> btw how to check if error is an empty string?
[08:59:31] <jqser> coz i did it in if block
[08:59:36] <jqser> checking length
[08:59:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:59:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you check the length...
[08:59:47] <duch_kazatel> brb
[08:59:47] <jqser> error.length>0
[08:59:58] <jqser> and it was still executing
[09:00:05] <jqser> when there was nothing in error
[09:00:13] <jqser> or atleast nothing that is a message
[09:00:37] <jqser> error - its a variable or something from jquery validate library
[09:01:13] <jqser> i'll post a code
[09:01:47] <jqser> http://jsfiddle.net/HL4km/
[09:02:22] <jqser> this code is suposed to put error message in some place in html doc
[09:02:50] <jqser> but when there is no error it still executes and causes exclaimation mark to show with no error message
[09:02:59] <jqser> after message was shown
[09:03:26] <jqser> <I mean I 1st input incorrect formated dat in e.g. email input box
[09:03:33] <jqser> and it displays error message
[09:03:55] <jqser> then i correct email to correct form lik nothing@nowhere.com

[09:05:58] <jqser> ?
[09:06:24] <duch_kazatel> i had to restart
[09:06:28] <jqser> When I started describing problem with pasted code there started to show **** disconected messages
[09:06:51] <duch_kazatel> okay
[09:08:08] <jqser> http://jsfiddle.net/HL4km/
[09:08:19] <jqser> this code is a problem
[09:08:30] <duch_kazatel> okay.  what's your question?
[09:08:36] <jqser> its jquery validate thing
[09:09:08] <jqser> when i input in a validated field of form wrong input it displays warning message
[09:09:26] <jqser> with excalimation mark inside "red dot"
[09:09:37] <jqser> after i correct data in field
[09:09:46] <jqser> message disappears- thats good
[09:09:49] <mechamjoseph> hey could anyone help me activate a function on multiple “on” events? right now i have two separate lines to handle it, but it seems like i should be able to provide a list of actions that would fire off. here’s my two lines of code : http://codepad.org/ic88zB9E
[09:09:53] <jqser> but excalimation mark remains
[09:09:59] <jqser> what is wrong
[09:10:18] <duch_kazatel> mechamjoseph you can do .on('mousemove keyup', function(){})
[09:10:28] <mechamjoseph> omg just like that huh?
[09:10:35] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[09:10:37] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:10:52] <jqser> I have thought it is a problem with if conditional

[09:11:33] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:11:45] <duch_kazatel> jqser are you ever removing the question mark?
[09:11:50] <duch_kazatel> or whatever it is.
[09:11:59] <duch_kazatel> i'm seeing code where you add stuff.
[09:12:04] <jqser> its a whole code there
[09:12:25] <jqser> well hmm i need to remove it somewhere
[09:12:38] <jqser> i did it in this function i posted
[09:13:11] <duch_kazatel> in this code, you're saying "if there is no error, empty a thing"
[09:13:24] <jqser> ya
[09:13:25] <duch_kazatel> rather, if the error isn't empty
[09:13:35] <duch_kazatel> are you getting duplicated errors?
[09:13:40] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[09:13:40] <duch_kazatel> etc
[09:13:43] <jqser> no
[09:13:48] <jqser> is fine
[09:13:56] <jqser> i hust got an empty span tag
[09:14:03] <jqser> where should be error message
[09:14:09] <jqser> in my html doc
[09:14:13] <duch_kazatel> your console
[09:14:19] <duch_kazatel> take a look there
[09:14:31] <jqser> so seems i need to check if there is nothing in string
[09:14:51] <duch_kazatel> that callback looks like it's for errors only.
[09:14:52] <duch_kazatel> sooo...
[09:15:02] <jqser> <span class="error" for="email" style="padding: 5px; color: #B94A48; display: none;"></span>
[09:15:16] <jqser> well ya
[09:15:42] <jqser> so my other thought was how to make inserting those mark and message i one command
[09:15:43] <duch_kazatel> so you want to remove an error message when there is no error message?
[09:15:44] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:15:55] <jqser> so it would be dependent on error variable/object
[09:16:09] <duch_kazatel> the code pasted in http://jsfiddle.net/HL4km/ likely only runs when there is an error.
[09:16:18] <duch_kazatel> you can't have an error that then isn't an error.
[09:16:31] <jqser> ya and when is no error message disppears
[09:16:38] <jqser> but exclaimation mark remains
[09:16:51] <duch_kazatel> and you're adding the exclamation mark yourself, right?
[09:17:03] <jqser> so making it dependent on error seems to solve problem
[09:17:08] <jqser> ya
[09:17:11] <duch_kazatel> or am I getting that part wrong, because it looks like you're trying to hide error messaging in the handler for errors.
[09:17:15] <jqser> message is "appendTo"
[09:17:23] <duch_kazatel> so it'll never remove, because you'll never hit this callback.
[09:17:35] <duch_kazatel> when successful i mean.
[09:17:54] <jqser> so what happens with error message?
[09:17:58] <jqser> :D
[09:18:07] <jqser> It more looks like it runs always
[09:18:17] <duch_kazatel> links to documentation?
[09:20:23] <jqser> documentation starts here
[09:20:24] <jqser> http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[09:21:47] <duch_kazatel> that callback only controls where error messaging goes.
[09:21:58] <duch_kazatel> it will likely not run on a successful validation attempt
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/#success
[09:22:32] <duch_kazatel> this is what you want.
[09:22:41] <jqser> so where the heck does message go?
[09:22:43] <jqser> :D
[09:22:54] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:23:12] <jqser> If it does not run on succes so why messge disappears?
[09:23:27] <duch_kazatel> is that its internal handling?
[09:23:27] <jqser> and excalimation remains?
[09:23:40] <duch_kazatel> just telling you what i'm seeing in the docs?
[09:23:46] <jqser> ok
[09:23:48] <jqser> hm
[09:24:00] <duch_kazatel> you might have things wrong in a lot more ways than one.
[09:24:09] <jqser> so I need to make my span with exclaimation a part of message or whatever
[09:24:37] <jqser> dang
[09:27:31] <jqser> so i would try making this in one line of code instead of 2 different commands
[09:27:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:27:49] <duch_kazatel> you would add your error messaging in one place, and remove it in another.
[09:28:10] <jqser> not message
[09:28:15] <jqser> an excalimation mark
[09:28:23] <jqser> message is removed autimaticaly
[09:29:08] <jqser> e-mai: balh ! wrong email format
[09:29:20] <jqser> e-mail: balh@blah.com !
[09:29:27] <jqser> that how it looks more or less
[09:29:37] <duch_kazatel> error messaging is synonymous in this case.
[09:29:46] <duch_kazatel> you are conflating things.
[09:30:13] <duch_kazatel> you add in your error messaging place, and remove in a success place.
[09:33:01] <airdem> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10745862 is this wrong?
[09:33:49] <airdem> because $('form.accelerated .row').each(function() { $(this).append(filler); }); appends nothing
[09:34:09] <airdem> while replacing filler with "<p>" appends p elements correctly
[09:34:21] <duch_kazatel> could you create a more complete example in a fiddle?
[09:34:51] <airdem> duch_kazatel, but the definition of my filler variable is correct?
[09:35:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/43ABh/
[09:35:56] <duch_kazatel> looks like it.
[09:36:32] <airdem> it seems to work if i move the var definition inside the each
[09:36:47] <duch_kazatel> could you please paste your code in a fiddle?
[09:36:55] <airdem> thought it would be faster to let it outside of the each
[09:37:00] <airdem> gimme a sec
[09:37:49] <hesco> Baffled by parse error, as described here:  https://gist.github.com/hesco/c7c1a0e622fc98776dab
[09:37:58] <hesco> any pointers would be appreciated.
[09:38:47] <airdem> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/43ABh/2/
[09:39:04] <airdem> it seems like if i leave the filler outside of the each it gets only appened to the last .row element
[09:39:57] <airdem> $(this).append(filler.clone()); did the trick. but i dont know if that good coding :)
[09:40:04] <airdem> *if thats
[09:40:31] <duch_kazatel> you have to clone it each time.
[09:40:35] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're moving it around.
[09:40:53] <airdem> duch_kazatel, whats better, cloning or defining it each time?
[09:41:04] <duch_kazatel> i'd clone it personally.
[09:41:22] <duch_kazatel> that way you have your one fragment that you copy every time, instead of creating new fragments.
[09:42:28] <airdem> alright, thank you a lot duch_kazatel
[09:45:24] <hesco> I created a new paste of my code at:  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=uDFg4Mwwz1
[09:46:17] <hesco> my first step was to refactor what I had working using the .change
[09:46:48] <hesco> but I want to enable the commented out options and use the .on method instead I think
[09:48:11] <duch_kazatel> non togetherjs version of hesco's link with the body tag removed: http://jsfiddle.net/34H9N/
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> hesco replace .change(function(){}) with .on('change', function(){});
[09:48:49] <duch_kazatel> if that's what you want.
[09:49:15] <duch_kazatel> also: div#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked
[09:49:20] <duch_kazatel> this is not a good selector.
[09:52:19] <hesco> duch_kazatel: thanks.  Things are working fine when the form is initially loaded and used.  But if data validation reloads the form with incomplete data, the .show(n) classes get .hid(d)e(n) again.
[09:52:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:53:29] <hesco> I have server side data validation which reloads the form, with everything hidden, confusing the user
[09:54:01] <duch_kazatel> ".show(n) classes get .hid(d)e(n) again." that statement i sstrange
[09:54:06] <hesco> perhaps I ought to push most of that data validation out to the front end
[09:54:25] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like things are getting removed and you're expecting them not to.
[09:54:53] <hesco> not removed, just hidden when the form is reloaded.
[09:55:19] <duch_kazatel> but seriously, div#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked) should change.  you want #list_options, then add a class to your radios and make those a delegated target, then look at .prop('checked') in your handler and go from there.
[09:57:34] <hesco> thanks, I will try to sort out what that means and test it then
[09:57:45] <hesco> duch_kazatel: ^^^\
[09:58:02] <duch_kazatel> $('#list_options').on('change', '.radioClass', function(){});
[09:59:16] <duch_kazatel> div#list_options is redundant
[09:59:19] <hesco> then I suppose I write a conditional inside that anonymous function to test for that .prop('checked') attribute, is that right?
[09:59:26] <duch_kazatel> yep
[09:59:34] <duch_kazatel> *value, not attribute
[09:59:36] <hesco> ok, trying that next, thanks
[10:03:25] <Technodrome> so when you make a slider / carousel , is that pretty much how any sort of thing like say a multi step form, or any other “mvoing” content things work?
[10:03:48] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome lol this again?
[10:03:53] <duch_kazatel> it depends on the form.
[10:03:55] <Technodrome> naw wait now
[10:04:03] <Technodrome> i just got back on and wanted to resume
[10:04:16] <Technodrome> i’ve been studying slider / carousel code
[10:04:26] <duch_kazatel> if the form is going to change from step to step or whatever, ajax in a new page.
[10:04:39] <duch_kazatel> otherwise just validate your data and have your "pages" hidden
[10:06:03] <Technodrome> yes , hidden like you would in a slider right?
[10:06:16] <duch_kazatel> basically
[10:06:19] <Technodrome> yeah
[10:06:24] <duch_kazatel> if that's the visual effect you want.
[10:06:38] <Technodrome> i mean, i’m building a form right now
[10:06:42] <Technodrome> it has 4 steps
[10:06:51] <House_> Hello everyone, does anyone know a way to change color of an png image with CSS or JS so it works on all browsers ? This is image i need to change color http://i.imgur.com/mPzdHge.png i need to change it to #696969
[10:07:03] <Technodrome> before it goes to next, it does some validation with the server side, then the last step i wanted to just be a normal form post
[10:07:06] <Technodrome> if that makes sense
[10:07:29] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome in that case, you'll want everything on page and hidden.
[10:07:39] <Technodrome> yes
[10:07:43] <duch_kazatel> instead of ajaxing in new pages.
[10:07:44] <Technodrome> thats how i planeed it
[10:08:00] <Technodrome> as in ajax’ing in new whole pages ?
[10:08:05] <decx> didnt you link jquery step already yesterday, that's all you need
[10:08:12] <decx> steps*
[10:08:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you all ready linked in something you can use.
[10:08:28] <Technodrome> if i was going to do that, i might as well do a multi step form with no javascript
[10:08:41] <decx> that does it with hidden stuff, with ajax, with iframes
[10:08:47] <decx> whatever you want
[10:09:00] <duch_kazatel> "i might as well do a multi step form with no javascript"
[10:09:02] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:12:27] <duch_kazatel> House_ your best bet is probably filters.
[10:12:53] <House_> you have any example or something ?
[10:13:01] <duch_kazatel> !g css filters
[10:13:03] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: CSS Filters - HTML5 Demos → https://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/css/filters/index.html
[10:13:34] <duch_kazatel> or this: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/filters/understanding-css/
[10:23:27] <airdem> just for clarification: if i define a jq function like $.fn.foo = function() {}; i have to use it like $('element').foo(); right?
[10:24:39] <systemfault> Yes
[10:25:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/69F3z/
[10:25:42] <airdem> thanks guys
[10:26:08] <systemfault> The jQuery guy thought it would be a good idea to rename .prototype to .fn…
[10:26:23] <duch_kazatel> i wonder what the reasoning was behind that one.
[10:26:24] <systemfault> (It wasn't)
[10:26:34] <duch_kazatel> like, was that the original intent?
[10:26:46] <systemfault> I don’t know :/
[10:27:10] <airdem> well... its shorter?
[10:27:29] <duch_kazatel> sure, and more confusing,
[10:27:53] <systemfault> airdem: So.. you would “rename” something standard and universally known to something nobody knows to save letters?
[10:27:55] <duch_kazatel> shit i remember finding that one out yesterday.  seeing that little snippet blew my mind.
[10:28:40] <airdem> systemfault, it was the only reason i could think of renaming it from prototype to fn :)
[10:29:06] <airdem> well he could also rename it to pt then... dunno
[10:29:29] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet it has something to do with it not originally being the prototype.
[10:29:29] <airdem> or keep all 3 variants.
[10:31:59] <rodney757> I'm trying to read a file that a user wants to upload, find a value from that file, and then use that value to do a task. I'm having trouble using that value. I think I need to use a Deferred, but I'm not completly sure as I don't fully understand deferreds. Here's my code http://jsfiddle.net/N6fT5/. Any ideas on what I need to do?
[10:32:16] <rodney757> mostly look at line 30
[10:35:02] <jmurphy> if i have a jquery wrapped set of uls stored as a variable - is there a way to search the stored dom elements using selectors such as ('li > ul > span')
[10:35:15] <duch_kazatel> .find()
[10:43:52] <duch_kazatel> i am now dumping through the jquery github repo looking for the commit that made .fn = .prototype/.
[10:44:04] <duch_kazatel> pretty sure i'm crazy at this point.
[10:44:29] <systemfault> :)
[10:44:33] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c3c706d3f24dbad0fdeb80fe9caf158bd9d6de66/jquery/jquery.js#L27
[10:44:53] <duch_kazatel> that's the first commit available.
[10:48:04] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: many frameworks allow multi step form creation without the need of ajax
[10:48:20] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome right.
[10:48:36] <Technodrome> i was just using, if i can’t have it all how i want it , i would just go that route
[10:48:56] <duch_kazatel> not sure what the whole "with no javascript" part of that comment was about.
[10:49:03] <Technodrome> i meant with no ajax
[10:49:11] <Technodrome> but of course , you got political on me!
[10:49:12] <duch_kazatel> you use the multistep plugin you linked to take care of the display and then build out your ajax yourself.
[10:49:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:49:16] <duch_kazatel> political?
[10:49:43] <duch_kazatel> you mean pedantic?
[10:49:44] <Technodrome> I appreciate the help duch_kazatel  :)
[10:50:12] <Technodrome> there is just many ways to accomplish this
[10:51:02] <Technodrome> use one form, use javascript to split it up while doing validation on every next step, and of course the final server side one , or just use django’s multi step form wizard thing, no ajax here
[10:51:21] <Technodrome> or use ajax where you just pull in html content , so like server side, but pulling in the html itself
[10:51:34] <Technodrome> and then I’m sure there is even more ways , hehehe
[10:51:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah, it all depends on what you want to do
[10:52:19] <Technodrome> basically, i just wanted to have one form split up to make it a little easier , all one form was fine, and this i guess will work out
[10:56:56] <duch_kazatel> i really hate coldfusion.
[10:57:08] <duch_kazatel> i feel like it's fucking with me at this point.
[10:58:03] <BillCriswell> I bet it is.
[10:58:54] <duch_kazatel> it's such an awful language.  genuinely.  CF9 is better, but it's like...
[10:59:22] <duch_kazatel> <cfscript> gives me some javascript-ish goodness, but it's still terribly broken and wrong.
[11:00:48] <BillCriswell> I feel that mostly everything sucks recently. I might need a vacation.
[11:01:20] <BillCriswell> I feel like stan in that episode of south park where everything he hears just sounds like shitting sounds.
[11:01:43] <duch_kazatel> that blows.  just feeling burnt out?
[11:02:45] <BillCriswell> yeah, not digging this project I'm working on at all, so it's hard to work on it and the lack of me working on it just makes me have to work harder on it closer to the dead line and get really annoyed. My own fault mostly.
[11:03:02] <duch_kazatel> ouch.  any particular reason you're not feeling it?
[11:04:10] <BillCriswell> Inherited someone else's CSS which is insanely over specific. The Sass files are broken up in weird ways. The files literally take 5 seconds to compile each time I hit save.
[11:04:14] <BillCriswell> Just super annoying shit.
[11:04:35] <duch_kazatel> lmao ours is far worse.
[11:04:42] <duch_kazatel> we're at 15+ on our sass
[11:04:49] <alexut> i'm trying to change a data attribute when i change row orders in a table with sortable.js . any idea why this dose not work ?
[11:04:49] <duch_kazatel> just did a compile that took 22 seconds.
[11:04:53] <alexut> http://jsfiddle.net/alexut/rZZ4f/1/
[11:04:59] <BillCriswell> That's depressing duch_kazatel.
[11:05:37] <duch_kazatel> woah i'm forgetting how to math right now.
[11:06:14] <BillCriswell> alexut: The attribute won't update, but the data on the element does if that makes sense.
[11:06:16] <dweave> hey has anyone used jQuery ui sortable on a mobile device.  Problem I’m having: user is unable to scroll if there are many sortable items on page.  adding delay simply delays “grabbing” the item but scroll is still disabled
[11:07:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha.
[11:07:19] <duch_kazatel> if i have 80% of a number, how to I get 100%?  what's the formula
[11:07:31] <duch_kazatel> i feel like a moron right now holy shit.
[11:07:35] <BillCriswell> alexut: You're always setting the number to 1 in your code though.
[11:08:17] <alexut> BillCriswell : it dosen't make sense for me. -_-' thanks for trying to help.
[11:08:38] <d0de> http://pastebin.com/QWMzAs8L <- can anyone work out why the variable sound isn't being passed to meanderUpToMax() ?
[11:09:03] <alexut> and yea, it probabilly should stay 1, but i least i could see a change i can work from.
[11:09:42] <amarsaini> anybody can help with typeahead
[11:09:48] <d0de> the first console log correctly returns the object property name, the second one returns 'undefined;

[11:12:58] <orhanhen_> d0de: Did you check if meanderUpToMax is being called from line 17? Maybe something else is calling it. Try console logging something inside the if statement where you call meanderUpToMax

[11:20:38] <amarsaini> but with bootstrap tags it doesnot
[11:20:39] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini ... sure let me copy this over to one of the suggested services for you.  one sec.
[11:21:33] <duch_kazatel> here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/A4Wru/
[11:21:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: n / .8 ?
[11:21:47] <duch_kazatel> mind giving us the broken code so we can better assist.
[11:22:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that gives me 80% of a given number.
[11:22:22] <duch_kazatel> i want 100% if I have the 80% value
[11:22:27] <duch_kazatel> n*1.25 was it.
[11:23:39] <orhanhen_> duch_kazatel: Yeah, 1/0.8
[11:23:46] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:24:03] <BillCriswell> Hmm
[11:25:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: 100 * .3 = 30
[11:25:33] <BillCriswell> 30 / .3 = 100
[11:25:59] <BillCriswell> I'm tired
[11:26:11] <orhanhen_> What was the question?
[11:26:21] <BillCriswell> 1 / 0.8
[11:26:28] <BillCriswell> Ignore that, not the console.
[11:26:40] <duch_kazatel> i needed 100% of a number when I only had 80%
[11:27:02] <orhanhen_> Ah, okay. So there isn't a problem anymore? Haha
[11:27:06] <duch_kazatel> nope :)
[11:27:09] <duch_kazatel> i remembered
[11:27:14] <orhanhen_> Cool :)
[11:27:33] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't multiplyin it by 1.25 give you 125% of the original number though?
[11:28:07] <orhanhen_> BillCriswell: no, because 100*0.8*1.25 = 100
[11:28:17] <duch_kazatel> 80 * 1.25 = 100
[11:28:53] <orhanhen_> 1.25 = 1/0.8   ->   0.8*(1/0.8) = 0.8/0.8 = 1
[11:28:58] <BillCriswell> I shouldn't eb awake righ t now.
[11:29:03] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hahahaha
[11:30:37] <amarsaini> bootstrap tags + typeahead not working http://jsfiddle.net/Gaav9/
[11:30:53] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini click "update" first.
[11:31:08] <amarsaini> http://jsfiddle.net/Gaav9/1/
[11:31:22] <duch_kazatel> wait what? that doesn't make sense.  where are the bootstrap "tags"?
[11:31:51] <orhanhen_> Yeah, this doesn't have any bootstrap? What's the problem?
[11:32:00] <amarsaini> http://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/bootstrap3/ i am using this plugin
[11:32:15] <amarsaini> + typeahead
[11:33:19] <BillCriswell> I can't believe hwo much that was escaping me at that moment.
[11:33:53] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini there's an example using typeahead on that page.
[11:34:21] <amarsaini> yea but that example just makes a get request every time
[11:34:32] <amarsaini> so i was trying to use typeahead example
[11:34:41] <amarsaini> that will use a query instead
[11:34:56] <amarsaini> instead of getting whole data
[11:34:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:35:00] <CaffeineCoding> I need a stackoverflow.com problem views, if you know why my code isnt work, please leave a fiddle and comment http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22727033/jquery-selector-on-element-with-css-youtube-view-counter
[11:35:22] <orhanhenrik> I don't get what you mean amarsaini
[11:35:52] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding erm, that's kind of a strange way to ask for help.
[11:35:52] <dkog> Is ".done()" the preferred way of handling formerly "{success: ...}" in AJAX calls?
[11:36:01] <duch_kazatel> dkog yes.
[11:36:22] <dkog> Why?  Is there a reference explaining advantages?
[11:36:28] <duch_kazatel> promises.
[11:36:38] <duch_kazatel> the former callback system is getting deprecated.
[11:36:56] <duch_kazatel> the new system relies on a different infrastructure that is far more robust.
[11:37:29] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding "My question is, how can it be changed so instead of using keyword detection, it can instead use a number detection range for each youtube feed on the subscriptions page" - huh?
[11:38:12] <dkog> Promises and deferred just seem more complicated and another thing to have to learn the ins and outs of, when the previous system was simple & worked...
[11:38:17] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: I don't understand the question.. What do you want to accomplish? Find elements with a certain range of numbers as its conent?
[11:38:30] <CaffeineCoding> It would be deeply appreciated if I can have some help or suggestions with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22727033/
[11:38:32] <dkog> I assume there are advantages, but instead of just jumping into "how it works", I'm curious what they are
[11:38:45] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding stop posting that.  your phrasing is bizarre and unhelpful ther.e
[11:38:55] <duch_kazatel> dkog huh?
[11:39:14] <dkog> what the advantages are I mean
[11:39:20] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: Two people replied to you here, answer if you want help, don't post the same message over and over
[11:39:32] <snover> dkog: the main confusion you probably will experience is that jquery’s implementation is wrong and broken
[11:40:01] <dkog> snover: impl of promisses is broken?
[11:40:03] <snover> yes
[11:40:03] <CaffeineCoding> my apologies
[11:40:18] <dkog> fantastic
[11:40:32] <CaffeineCoding> Yes I have tried many variations, It doesnt seem to work no matter what I do
[11:40:42] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding how about you start from the beginning.
[11:40:45] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[11:40:48] <CaffeineCoding> but i have hope atleast one person may know of my problem
[11:41:07] <CaffeineCoding> hide views on youtube containing between 1-301
[11:41:10] <CaffeineCoding> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22727033/
[11:41:25] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding i swear if you post another SO link i will block you jesus
[11:41:27] <d0de> I feel like I'm doing something incredibly stupid. Can anyone guess why the expression [ (1+0.874) / 2 ] would evaluate to 5.437?
[11:41:37] <d0de> omh
[11:41:38] <d0de> omg
[11:41:38] <CaffeineCoding> i have reliable subscriptions but i know how to hide videos by keyword but not by view
[11:41:45] <d0de> because it's a string
[11:41:56] <CaffeineCoding> or I have tried many variations though i dont have much experience with Jquery
[11:41:57] <d0de> I AM doing something incredibly stupid
[11:42:01] <dkog> snover: can you share a link re broken issues?
[11:42:04] <snover> spec-compliant promises: normal sync code: `final = c(b(a()))`, async-promises equivalent: `a.then(function (value) { return b(value); }).then(function (value) { return c(value); }).then(function (final) { // use final here });`
[11:42:04] <duch_kazatel> dkog you can do neat things like register callbacks without nesting a whole bunch
[11:42:13] <snover> jquery’s broken promises do not chain properly
[11:42:31] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding you want to match everything that contains 1-301?
[11:42:40] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: What's wrong with the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/fVtaF/7/ ?
[11:42:44] <dkog> snover: so the 2nd part of that wouldn't work in jquery you mean?
[11:43:15] <snover> not in the way you would expect
[11:43:47] <snover> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9016 bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14510
[11:44:10] <CaffeineCoding> ".yt-lockup-meta-info > :last-child" is the div that contains the view number and ".feed-item-container" is the main result box to hide
[11:44:28] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding the fiddle gives you an example on how to use filter.
[11:44:50] <duch_kazatel> i doubt it was intended as a "drop-in and go" solution
[11:44:50] <CaffeineCoding> this is a better use of my idea but it still doesnt work, http://jsfiddle.net/eWweU/10/
[11:45:08] <duch_kazatel> use .filter() instead of .each()
[11:45:44] <BillCriswell> I might actually be hallucinating.
[11:45:49] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell woah what
[11:46:03] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: The last fiddle you sent works. If the last div is between 0 and 300, the parent is hidden. Does exactly what you wrote in the code
[11:46:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Fuzzies everywehre.
[11:46:40] <CaffeineCoding> i replaced it with filter, still nothing :(
[11:47:02] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding are you actually trying to write code, or just copy/paste things until something works?
[11:47:04] <CaffeineCoding> it the parent command and issue
[11:47:06] <CaffeineCoding> ?
[11:47:12] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: Read my message. What should happen instead? If any of them is between 0-300?
[11:47:19] <CaffeineCoding> i've no idea how to make it work
[11:47:29] <CaffeineCoding> display none
[11:47:37] <CaffeineCoding> is the goal
[11:47:47] <CaffeineCoding> $('.feed-item-container').find('.yt-lockup-meta-info:last-child').each(function(){
[11:47:52] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: Right now, (http://jsfiddle.net/eWweU/10/) it's hiding the feed-item-container if the last yt-lockup-meta-info inside is between 0-300
[11:48:17] <CaffeineCoding> ".yt-lockup-meta-info:last-child" is the view number for the main div "'.feed-item-container"
[11:48:37] <dweave> is there a jquery ui-sortable like widget that works on mobile
[11:48:40] <dweave> without touchpunch
[11:48:41] <duch_kazatel> i feel like CaffeineCoding isn't really event trying at this point.
[11:48:54] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: So what's wrong? It's hiding the first container, and the second one is visible, like it should
[11:48:56] <CaffeineCoding> as i said i have not much experience with jquery
[11:49:02] <CaffeineCoding> i have tried all i can with what i know
[11:49:22] <duch_kazatel> right - we're trying to give you help and resources.  what isn't clicking at this point?
[11:49:38] <CaffeineCoding> even what people have helped me with isnt working, i appreciate all help i assure you
[11:50:02] <CaffeineCoding> im sorry if you think I am being lazy or not trying but i assure you i have and am
[11:50:35] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: What's not working? It's doing what it says. If the last meta-info is between 0-300, the container is hidden. In http://jsfiddle.net/eWweU/10/ the first container is hidden, and the second is visible
[11:51:03] <CaffeineCoding> it isnt hiding the subscriptions box result at all
[11:51:11] <CaffeineCoding> thats the only use for the code inteneded
[11:51:19] <dkog> CaffeineCoding: you need to ask smaller questions.  Break your problem into specific pieces and figure out each one, one at a time.  Nobody will be able to help you with giant problems that require reading your mind and sitting in your lap looking at your code base.
[11:51:22] <CaffeineCoding> i am seeing no effect what so ever, not even some being hidden
[11:52:00] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: It's hiding the div in the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/7T4GS/ I made the first div red, and the second blue. If you can't see that the first is hidden, you should check your vision
[11:52:04] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding then supply a fiddle demonstrating that effect, because i can't see any box.
[11:52:06] <dkog> CaffeineCoding: Instead of trying to solve YOUR problem, try to break your problem into smaller problems that can be express indepdendently
[11:52:07] <CaffeineCoding> just want to hide videos on subscription page on youtube that are in the div containing 1-300 views within the main div
[11:52:27] <CaffeineCoding> it works on fiddle but not youtube, i cant seem to figure it out, sorry
[11:52:37] <dkog> CaffeineCoding: So 1) identify those, 2) hide them.  Those are two separate issues.  Stop combining.
[11:52:51] <CaffeineCoding> how can you combine it though?
[11:53:01] <CaffeineCoding> or something simular?
[11:53:11] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding start with just getting the things you want to hide.
[11:53:18] <duch_kazatel> start there - ignore "hiding" anything.
[11:53:33] <CaffeineCoding> I have by keyword...
[11:53:47] <CaffeineCoding> but it doesnt hide videos with hardly any views, thats what i am now trying to do
[11:54:02] <duch_kazatel> right - so how do you do it by numeric range?
[11:54:02] <orhanhenrik> $('.feed-item-container') doesn't even exist on my youtube, what page are you referring to?
[11:54:54] <CaffeineCoding> this is my code for hiding videos with keywords or changing css by importance http://jsfiddle.net/JzB9w/, I share my appreciation of your help
[11:55:10] <duch_kazatel> ...
[11:55:12] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[11:56:14] <CaffeineCoding> http://prntscr.com/3aaoe5
[11:56:27] <duch_kazatel> nope.  in the fiddle plox.
[11:56:31] <CaffeineCoding> thats the main div for each box or result on the sub page
[11:56:42] <orhanhenrik> CaffeineCoding: Just a tip, you should really try to be more specific with your language and questions. Spend a few minutes writing the questions instead, so we are able to understand. Imagine you're reading it and don't know anything about the problem
[11:57:07] <CaffeineCoding> sorry i am at school i have class now, my appologies, i will be back later with more precision to my question
[11:57:21] <CaffeineCoding> again, my appologies
[11:57:26] <duch_kazatel> you're putting way too much effort into this.
[11:57:34] <duch_kazatel> shoulda just update your fiddle.
[11:57:46] <CaffeineCoding> yes but it would make a huge diffrence certainly in my life with my limited time
[11:57:54] <CaffeineCoding> its worth it to me as it may not be to others
[11:58:01] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:58:03] <CaffeineCoding> youtube is my news and entertainment source, one of them
[11:58:26] <CaffeineCoding> just trying to hide videos with low views thats all
[11:58:34] <duch_kazatel> on what page?
[11:58:44] <duch_kazatel> i'll bite at this point.
[11:58:44] <CaffeineCoding> subscriptions page containing 1-300 views
[11:58:59] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions this one?
[11:59:03] <CaffeineCoding> yes
[11:59:05] <dkog> this is not a jquery issue, it's a basic programming issue
[11:59:33] <CaffeineCoding> I have to go to class now but ill link you the actual question and what not stackoverflow.com/questions/22727033/
[11:59:44] <duch_kazatel> dude.
[11:59:50] <duch_kazatel> don't paste that link again.
[12:00:17] <CaffeineCoding> only if you didnt or lost it
[12:00:25] <duch_kazatel> we don't want to see it.
[12:00:39] <CaffeineCoding> i have class, thanks for all your help, i appreciate it :) hopefully i will have it working and i will publicize it for all
[12:01:48] <BillCriswell> StackOverflow hates me.
[12:01:54] <orhanhenrik> Why?
[12:08:33] <dkog> Question about http://www.danieldemmel.me/blog/2013/03/22/an-introduction-to-jquery-deferred-slash-promise/
[12:08:56] <dkog> In his "Another solution" he does $.when().then().done()
[12:09:10] <dkog> How is this different from $.when().done().done() ?
[12:09:23] <dkog> ie what does the then do that done doesn't here?
[12:09:36] <duch_kazatel> lol i have that youtube dude's answer all done.
[12:09:37] <duch_kazatel> that was easy.
[12:10:17] <orhanhenrik> Haha post it to him then
[12:10:31] <duch_kazatel> hell no.
[12:10:44] <duch_kazatel> homeslice needs to learn some basics
[12:11:49] <orhanhenrik> Haha indeed, he didn't even know how to form a sentence that made sense..
[12:12:08] <duch_kazatel> it's a classic xy problem.
[12:12:30] <duch_kazatel> and one of those things where he was trying to use terminology and phrasing he really didn't understand.
[12:14:22] <jmurphy> does jquery do anything to concatinate objects that are passed into method signatures? I'm looking at a library that turns a call of {foo: bar},{baz: cad} into a single object. I'm wondering what that is called and how it works
[12:14:44] <duch_kazatel> maybe they're using extend()
[12:14:47] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery extend
[12:14:49] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery.extend() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[12:15:52] <jmurphy> im not seeing it: https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/src/typeahead/typeahead.js#L14-L79
[12:16:24] <jmurphy> i want to figure out how to pass in additional dataset objects
[12:16:25] <jmurphy> http://jsfiddle.net/cwahlers/33TWK/4/
[12:16:35] <duch_kazatel> wait what
[12:16:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm confused.
[12:16:48] <duch_kazatel> why are you asking about object concatenation and then pasting a link to a css thing?
[12:16:54] <jmurphy> gah wrong jsfiddle
[12:16:57] <duch_kazatel> lol okay.
[12:17:32] <jmurphy> http://jsfiddle.net/e7T43/
[12:17:52] <jmurphy> so the last 2 objects on there somehow get converted to 0.datasets
[12:18:13] <jmurphy> i have an array of those config objects - i'm trying to figure out how to combine the two
[12:19:11] <dkog> snover: I just read http://domenic.me/2012/10/14/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/ - what a mess
[12:20:37] <duch_kazatel> jmurphy you want to send multiple config objects?
[12:20:41] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i'm not sure what you're asking.
[12:21:07] <snover> dkog: i tried to get julian to follow the promises/a spec when they were first put into jquery but i was not successful.
[12:21:25] <dkog> I saw them make some excuse about performance
[12:22:35] <jmurphy> im not familiar with the object type that the typeahead constructor takes. It seems to be a csv list of objects. Object 1 has configuration values, Object 2 and Object 3, define a data set. I need to define N data sets, so i have an array of DataSet config objects. I have no i dea how to pass them in in place of the hard coded Object 2 and Object 3.
[12:25:05] <duch_kazatel> jmurphy it takes a variable number of objects.  nothing to do with csv.
[12:27:10] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel: how would i append my array of additional objects to the one in jsfiddle
[12:28:04] <dkog> so snover re your example `a.then(function (value) { return b(value); }).then(function (value) { return c(value); }).then(function (final) { // use final here });` ... this is equivalent to `var x = a(); ` then running b, c, and final all on x instead of chaining?
[12:28:43] <dkog> more like jQuery's usual way of $().x.y.z where they all apply to the first object
[12:29:40] <snover> the original example, in a compliant implementation, is equivalent to x = a(); x = b(x); final = c(x);
[12:30:00] <snover> or, `final = c(b(a()))`
[12:30:25] <dkog> and in jQuery it's x=a(); b(x); c(x); final(x);  ?
[12:30:55] <snover> i don’t even remember, i use dojo these days and its promises implementation is not broken ;)
[12:31:07] <snover> it is something like
[12:31:29] <duch_kazatel> jmurphy btw you were looking at the wrong part of the code.
[12:31:53] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/5ac126185a5d762407ae77cad3a21dc0e60ad0e6/src/typeahead/plugin.js#L108-L116
[12:32:13] <duch_kazatel> that should give you an eye into what's going on.
[12:32:23] <snover> if you do x = a(); x.then(function () { return 2; }); x.then(function (value) { return value + 1; }); x.then(function (value) { console.log(value); // 3 });
[12:32:35] <snover> i think that’s right
[12:33:11] <snover> the value of `value` in that example should always be whatever is returned by `a` but it is not so in jquery
[12:34:27] <dkog> does pipe() address this?
[12:35:06] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel:  its looks like its treating that object like an array
[12:35:16] <jmurphy> then slicing everything after the first array object off
[12:35:27] <duch_kazatel> !g javascript arguments array-like
[12:35:27] <jmurphy> so if i cast the object as an array i could just join them?
[12:35:29] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: arguments - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[12:35:38] <duch_kazatel> you could try that.
[12:40:43] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel: so i understand how to work with arguements inside the called function body - any idea on how to construct on object that can be passed in?
[12:42:08] <dkog> snover: "As of jQuery 1.8, the deferred.then() method returns a new promise that can filter the status and values of a deferred through a function, replacing the now-deprecated deferred.pipe() method." -- http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[12:42:48] <snover> well, that’s good, it’s less broken now
[12:43:08] <dkog> ok, drop dojo now :)
[12:43:25] <snover> why would anyone do that?
[12:44:11] <ravigehlot> Somehow the value from this input: http://jsfiddle.net/H2NLh/ does not change at all. I verified that the ids are being passed. It just doesn't change the DOM. What is going on?
[12:44:39] <snover> it’s like saying, oh, i replaced the stereo in my 1984 Honda Civic so it plays MP3s, you should get rid of your new Mercedes
[12:44:46] <snover> because now you can play MP3s in my car too
[12:45:08] <snover> but your car is still a shitty old civic, and i’ve got a really nice new mercedes that does a lot of other great stuff that yours doesn’t
[12:46:59] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot input#school_id.form-control should just be #school_id
[12:47:04] <duch_kazatel> no need for the extra stuff.
[12:47:22] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: doesn't work either
[12:47:53] <duch_kazatel> and you did a console.log(ui.item.id) to make sure that's what you think it is?
[12:48:01] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: The extra stuff is actually better because it makes it more specific
[12:48:07] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: yes, I get an id
[12:48:14] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: it just won't change the DOM
[12:48:15] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot actually, that makes it slower.
[12:48:26] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: okay
[12:48:31] <duch_kazatel> IDs should be unique to the page.  just use the ID.
[12:48:39] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: I agree
[12:49:18] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: I am puzzled though...why won't it change the DOM? I checked for conflicts as well since I am using Twitter Bootstrap, but I don't think that there is a conflict issue here.
[12:49:24] <erming> ... I pronounce myself the king of Procrastination. Got damnit.
[12:49:44] <duch_kazatel> "change the DOM" - is the input properly updating visually?
[12:50:06] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[12:50:30] <duch_kazatel> okay - and how are you checking "the dom"?  are you using a tool like firebug?
[12:50:36] <duch_kazatel> or are you hitting "view source" on the page
[12:50:42] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: For example, if I type just Al, I see a list with a bunch of Alabama High Schools. If I pick one, it puts it in the box. It just won't change the value which is always set to zero.
[12:50:54] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: firebug
[12:51:18] <duch_kazatel> dunno then.  without a more complete example, it's hard to help.
[12:51:32] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: for jQuery development I switch from Chrome to Firefox and use firebug
[12:52:04] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: it is puzzling
[12:54:53] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel: when using apply on function typeahead - what is the expected 'thisArg' that gets passed in
[12:54:56] <jmurphy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[12:55:12] <jmurphy> selectedInput = $('#multiple-datasets .typeahead').typeahead.apply(this, anArray);
[12:57:19] <duch_kazatel> wait why are you doing all this though?  what gives with the array in the first place?
[12:58:17] <jmurphy> i've programatically setup how many dataset elements are passed in instead of hard coiding them
[13:00:01] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: I fixed it
[13:00:55] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: The problem is that there was already a value="0" in the input tag. I was trying to set the value with val() but that didn't work. So I got rid of value="0" and used attr( 'value', ui.item.id )
[13:01:04] <duch_kazatel> jmurphy but why?  what do you plan to accomplish with that?
[13:01:30] <jmurphy> depending on the page structure i can pass in whatever dataset is on the page
[13:01:32] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot .val() should have updated the value
[13:01:58] <jmurphy> i could have 1 dataset i could have 5 datasets etc...
[13:02:17] <duch_kazatel> jmurphy i guess i don't see why that's useful.  but okay
[13:02:29] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: it should have. you are right. I think that Laravel was setting the value to empty or null...either or...
[13:02:46] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: either way, thanks for chatting with me on that, it did help me solve it.
[13:02:51] <ravigehlot> gtg brb
[13:03:12] <kevin> hey guys, soooooo i have a table that has rows added and deleted to its DOM. is there a way i can put a click handler on the tables rows, including the rows that are added *after* the js call to bind the handler?
[13:03:29] <duch_kazatel> kevin use event delegation instead.
[13:03:48] <duch_kazatel> $('table').on('click', 'tr', function(){});
[13:03:51] <bekabug> if i'm using jquery to load a div (.entry-content) from a url into a page...and that entry-content div contains the code for a gallery... how would i tell the DOM to reload the script for the gallery (sorry if this is too vague...i'm not exactly sure how to ask this question)
[13:04:36] <duch_kazatel> bekabug look at the documentation for the gallery and see if there's a way to manutlaly re-initialize it.
[13:04:40] <kevin> duch_kazatel, thanks.
[13:06:21] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel: it should work with - selectedInput = $('#multiple-datasets .typeahead').typeahead.apply(this, anArray);
[13:06:42] <jmurphy> but line 1641 errors out for return this.each(attach);
[13:06:57] <jmurphy> the arguements object looks correct the rest of the time
[13:07:21] <jmurphy> is this not accurate for the type of apply i'm executing?
[13:07:43] <bekabug> duch_kazatel ok
[13:08:11] <duch_kazatel> jmurphy what happens when you feed your configuration, and then the array?
[13:08:19] <duch_kazatel> configObj, theArray
[13:08:31] <duch_kazatel> just as arguments to the initializer?
[13:09:50] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/e7T43/1/ something like this
[13:12:05] <jmurphy> hrmm somethings broken on that
[13:12:05] <jmurphy> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[13:13:37] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/jquery_typeahead.md#usage
[13:13:42] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: Now that I have got a value="id", instead of sending that as the value of the field, it is sending the field itself as its value. lOL
[13:14:08] <jmurphy> ahh the fiddle was missing var
[13:14:15] <Forbidd3n> I have one long image that I want to load in a div, autoscroll as well as a scrollbar that follows and can move the div left to right.
[13:14:51] <Forbidd3n> I found a good scroller, but can't seem to figure out how to incorporate a scrollbar or write a simple one from scratch
[13:15:08] <Forbidd3n> Here is the scroller I am using - http://logicbox.net/jquery/simplyscroll/
[13:15:09] <duch_kazatel> ravigehlot huh?
[13:15:27] <duch_kazatel> Forbidd3n you want a single image, or multiple images?
[13:15:44] <Forbidd3n> single image
[13:15:55] <duch_kazatel> then that plugin may not be of help.
[13:15:58] <Forbidd3n> the image is 1500px timeline and the div with will be 750
[13:16:06] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: yeah I know
[13:16:25] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to write one with scrollLeft but it seems jittery
[13:16:29] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel: your example seems to work
[13:16:31] <Hopsy1> can someone help me with ccTLD shizzle?
[13:16:40] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Hopsy1
[13:16:40] <b-ot> Hopsy1: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:16:51] <Hopsy1> okay :P
[13:16:56] <Hopsy1> well
[13:17:35] <Leo2013> Who can help me ???? i got a conflict with jquery ... after i put this js file in my header jquery dont go anymore .. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c5e2cd8c79ec1d23ce85 is something wrong with the code or i am doing something wrong ?
[13:17:54] <duch_kazatel> Leo2013 any console errors?
[13:18:14] <Hopsy1> someoneeee has bought a domain name and I want to demand back. Where should I complain?
[13:18:17] <Leo2013> no errors .. with firebig
[13:18:23] <Leo2013> firebug
[13:18:47] <duch_kazatel> Hopsy1 not on topic, but why do you want to "demand back"?
[13:18:58] <duch_kazatel> Leo2013 can you setup a use case on jsfiddle?
[13:19:00] <Hopsy1> because its a trademark
[13:19:10] <duch_kazatel> Hopsy1 contact your lawyer then.
[13:19:21] <Leo2013> no its to big :( but i can send you the link as pm if you want
[13:19:32] <duch_kazatel> Leo2013 you can setup a simple use cas.e
[13:19:37] <Hopsy1> and i dont know who the leader is of all domain names
[13:19:58] <Forbidd3n> duch_kazatel: any way to use scrollLeft and not have it jittery, but smooth
[13:20:06] <duch_kazatel> Hopsy1 you need to have your lawyer contact the person listed in the whois.
[13:20:10] <jmurphy> duch_kazatel: got it - thanks for your help
[13:20:16] <Leo2013> sorry duch i dont know what do you mean
[13:20:20] <duch_kazatel> jmoney cool.
[13:20:25] <duch_kazatel> err, jmurphy
[13:20:48] <Hopsy1> duch_kazatel: yes he did! but the person behind the domainname is dumb
[13:21:00] <duch_kazatel> Hopsy1 then sue them?
[13:21:24] <Hopsy1> isnt there any institution that controls the domain names etc. etc.?
[13:21:40] <duch_kazatel> Hopsy1 they will tell you to effectively do the same.
[13:22:03] <Hopsy1> duch_kazatel:  no other options?
[13:22:17] <duch_kazatel> you've derailed the room enough i think ;)
[13:22:32] <Hopsy1> -_-' ok
[13:23:29] <Hopsy1> sooo, who wants some help?
[13:23:36] <Hopsy1> vladikoff?
[13:23:53] <vladikoff> oh hey Hopsy1, long time no talk
[13:23:56] <ravigehlot> duch_kazatel: I see value="2983" on my <input type="text" value="2983" >. But instead of sending that when posting, it sending "Oviedo High School" instead.
[13:24:07] <Hopsy1> hey vladikoff yes :D
[13:24:15] <nfff> Guys I dont get how backbone does anything apart from add bloat and complicate apps?
[13:24:21] <duch_kazatel> nfff lol
[13:24:22] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, I installed jQuery but it's not starting up, Segmentation Fault, what do i do?
[13:24:26] <nfff> Im sure its useful but in what situtation?
[13:24:38] <duch_kazatel> nfff when you want to bind data to views automatically.
[13:24:53] <Hopsy1> lol, reinstall will help vladikoff
[13:25:04] <__joshua__> nfff: backbone is a set of 4 objects.  how you structure everything is up to you.
[13:25:29] <duch_kazatel> nfff imagine a scenario where you have a page - let's say it's a product page.  lets say you could change a feature for the product an the page needs to update various things like the image, price, stats, etc.
[13:25:36] <duch_kazatel> backbone is cool in sutuations like that
[13:25:38] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, already tried 5 times, I'm on SunOS 4.1.3_U1B
[13:26:02] <duch_kazatel> vladikoff ... huh?
[13:26:06] <Hopsy1> vladikoff: ussually I get a segmentation fault when I unplug the ssd card of my raspberypi while he is writing some stuff
[13:26:22] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, let me try that
[13:28:13] <Hopsy1> vladikoff: do you have a google glass?!
[13:28:20] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, ye
[13:28:25] <nfff> duch_kazatel, how would backbone work? traditionally you'd just make ajax calls to the backend to retrieve new prices, stats etc?
[13:28:31] <Hopsy1> I see, SOOO COOOOL
[13:28:40] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, also thanks, reinstalling SSD Card drivers helped, everything works now
[13:28:54] <vladikoff> Hopsy1++
[13:28:55] <Hopsy1> nice!
[13:31:35] <Hopsy1> vladikoff: should you recommend me to buy a google glass? How is your experience?
[13:31:47] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, wair for the retail model, it will be cheaper
[13:33:43] <Hopsy1> vladikoff: okay, do you know when the retail model come online? And what is the battery span?
[13:34:45] <vladikoff> Hopsy1, battery span -> depending on how you use it, if you record a lot of video then it will run out quickly. otherwise basic usage lasts for ~1 day. Should retail this year :)
[13:35:27] <Hopsy1> ow nice, I cant wait! thank youu for the info
[13:45:45] <Forbidd3n> What would I look up to figure out how to get a scrollbar (custom) to scroll a div on drag of the dragging bar in the scrollbar?
[13:46:48] <CaffeineCoding> i have returned from school, and @duch_kazatel, I am running on -2 days of sleep and I been at school at 7am additionally, I have responsibilities that make me have to condence my point when i am low on time, additionally you know nothing about me and i clearly said i was at school and busy, i appreciate your help, but i dontappreciate your judgement
[13:52:30] <nfff> can someone explain why and when bakcbone/requirejs/angular are needed?
[13:52:59] <nfff> whats wrong with traditional js patterns?
[13:54:09] <BillCriswell> nfff: I wouldn't group requirejs with angular and backbone.
[13:54:36] <nfff> well any of these
[13:54:47] <nfff> whats wrong with traditional js patterns by themselves
[13:54:54] <nfff> like var mymodule = {}
[13:55:12] <Forbidd3n> anyone know how to sync custom scrollbar with scrolling div?
[13:55:44] <BillCriswell> nfff: I'd see using angular and backbone for bigger applications where more than one developer is working on it. It kind of forces them to do things a particular way which would be good for consistency?
[13:56:18] <BillCriswell> nfff: I don't really use either but that's the gist I tend to pick up.
[13:56:23] <nfff> but how big a project
[13:56:37] <nfff> I have 1-2000LOC project, and was trying to get a dev onboard
[13:56:40] <nfff> but wont touch it
[13:56:49] <nfff> he wants to totally re-write it
[13:56:56] <nfff> and i cant figure out what we gain
[13:57:05] <BillCriswell> nfff: I have no idea. I wouldn't think 2000 lines of code is a lot?
[13:57:05] <duch_away> nfff did you see my explanation for backbone?
[13:57:18] <duch_away> 2000 isn't that much.
[13:57:21] <nfff> duch_away, no
[13:57:28] <nfff> duch_kazatel, how would backbone work? traditionally you'd just make ajax calls to the backend to retrieve new prices, stats etc?
[13:57:33] <BillCriswell> Fucking question marks all the time when I'm typing. I can'tbreak it.
[13:58:03] <duch_away> nfff nope.  our frontend has all that data available at once.
[13:58:26] <duch_away> we're swapping to backbone soon because it would enable to us bind everything cleaner.
[13:58:30] <nfff> but duch_away, you load all possible data on page load?
[13:58:40] <duch_away> you could do either, really.
[13:58:50] <duch_away> instead of baking a bunch logic and data together, you let backbone handle that for you.
[13:59:31] <nfff> but what if you have a huge amount of data
[13:59:47] <nfff> it doesnt make sense to load on page load? itd be too intensive/redundant?
[13:59:53] <nfff> whats wrong with making ajax calls ?
[14:01:25] <duch_away> then use ajax with backbone instead.
[14:01:35] <duch_away> backbone is all about providing structure.
[14:01:50] <duch_away> you're conflating "data" with "pattern"
[14:02:01] <kegster> whats the -no-content.tar.gz download?
[14:02:22] <kegster> oops
[14:13:54] <Biganon> Hello, I'm having a problem with Autocomplete (jQuery UI). It works perfect everywhere, except on Firefox on Android. There, the autocomplete menu opens like once every 50 clicks, I can't reproduce it precisely but it's unusable. It works perfectly with the default Android browser, as well as Opera on Android.
[14:14:04] <Biganon> The page is : http://www.noctambule.ch/testaccueil
[14:14:38] <Biganon> Google doesn't have anything to say about Firefox on Android being facetious ; a mailing list says it should be ok with current versions
[14:15:45] <duch_away> that's a pretty old version of jquery.
[14:16:05] <Biganon> ha, it might explain the problem
[14:20:52] <CaffeineCoding> duch_away, if I need to contact you is this correct information? http://dod.gamepark.cz/  Czech Republic  Poland  Dutch  http://www.zpgaming.eu/user/1105-kazatel.html  duch_kazatel  duch_away  Robert0  Engineering adventure-works.com  roberto0@adventure-works.com  212-555-0187  Freelancer ?
[14:21:35] <duch_away> nope.
[14:21:37] <duch_away> definitely not.
[14:22:48] <CaffeineCoding> well you said you had an answer in the chat but you didn’t provide it so i was going to contact you for it
[14:23:16] <duch_kazatel> i also said i wouldn't give the answer away because of how simple it was.
[14:23:35] <CaffeineCoding> what may be simple and unimportant to you may not be to others
[14:24:04] <duch_kazatel> sure, but you learn by doing.
[14:24:21] <CaffeineCoding> you learn by collaborating
[14:24:23] <duch_kazatel> start with this: use .each() to go through every viewcount.
[14:24:27] <duch_kazatel> start with that.
[14:25:07] <CaffeineCoding> if its so simple then it wouldn’t be troublesome to help someone with not much experience would it? or is that to much trouble
[14:25:22] <duch_kazatel> the spirit of #jquery is to enable people to help themselves, not hand them the answer.
[14:25:35] <CaffeineCoding> i learn with examples
[14:25:47] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:25:58] <duch_kazatel> link me your example again?
[14:26:28] <CaffeineCoding> in this case, i don’t have much knowledge to relate to given it is more sophisticated than I am experienced in
[14:26:34] <CaffeineCoding> stackoverflow.com/questions/22727033/
[14:26:39] <duch_kazatel> the fiddle, yo.
[14:26:49] <duch_kazatel> and i just gave you your starting point
[14:27:06] <CaffeineCoding> http://jsfiddle.net/eWweU/4/ that one?
[14:27:59] <duch_kazatel> okay, so I'd start by going to that page and copying the entire "feed-list" ul into the fiddle.
[14:28:09] <duch_kazatel> leave the js for now, but replace your html.
[14:28:12] <nfff> Im watching a tutorial vid on backbone and underscorce and my head has exploded
[14:28:30] <duch_kazatel> nfff getting the idea now? :)
[14:28:38] <nfff> no :|
[14:28:43] <nfff> Hes on like 40 LOC
[14:28:50] <nfff> that can be done in like 4-5
[14:28:55] <nfff> I dont get it
[14:29:09] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:29:15] <CaffeineCoding> ill revise my current question to see if i can get better help
[14:29:17] <nfff> theres so many layers of abstracting
[14:29:19] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding ...
[14:29:32] <CaffeineCoding> thanks though
[14:29:35] <duch_kazatel> you're not even trying.
[14:29:36] <nfff> it's like why not just do a simple ajax call to retrieve the data!!!
[14:29:39] <duch_kazatel> it's like 8 lines of code jesus
[14:29:58] <CaffeineCoding> let me ask you, how long have you been coding with jquery?
[14:29:58] <Biganon> duch_kazatel: thanks for your help
[14:30:07] <Biganon> it is working as expected now
[14:30:13] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding a few years.  you need to start learning.
[14:30:15] <Forbidd3n> anyone that can help with configuring a custom scrollbar to move a custom scrolling horizontal div?
[14:30:18] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7t3j6/
[14:30:19] <duch_kazatel> there
[14:30:21] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[14:30:33] <duch_kazatel> Biganon of course :)
[14:30:34] <CaffeineCoding> great, i have only been using it off and on for less than a year
[14:31:01] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding you have no interest in learing - you want things handed to you.  i remember having the exact same mindset.  it will not get you far.
[14:31:01] <CaffeineCoding> and this issue or idea isnt exactly entry knowledge yet i want to share it for others as well
[14:31:03] <duch_kazatel> you're welcome.
[14:31:29] <CaffeineCoding> you know nothing of me
[14:31:30] <duch_kazatel> i told you where to start and you refused.  so i've given you your answer.
[14:31:32] <duch_kazatel> you'
[14:31:33] <duch_kazatel> re welcome
[14:32:20] <CaffeineCoding> so i dont have experience with jquery? that makes it automatically right to assume I have no interest in learning something clearly not entry level?
[14:32:24] <dkog> I ignored this guy a few hours ago
[14:32:43] <CaffeineCoding> or interest in learning at all?
[14:32:53] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding way to put words in my mouth.  i gave you a starting point, and you gave up.
[14:32:59] <CaffeineCoding> again, thanks, you have helped a lot especially your opinions
[14:33:04] <duch_kazatel> i gave you the answer, and you're still complaining.
[14:33:40] <CaffeineCoding> did i put words into your mouth? or shall we both revise the log
[14:33:48] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ.
[14:33:53] <duch_kazatel> i'm done.  thanks for playing.
[14:35:31] <CaffeineCoding> i have 28.6% free time with my implications of my life restricting my concentration to even set down and learn currently what I love or enjoy, so sorry that I am not up to par with your requirements
[14:36:00] <duch_kazatel> let's take this out of the channel.  you've derailed enough.
[14:36:06] <duch_kazatel> feel free to PM me if you want.
[14:36:50] <CaffeineCoding> im just taking the train where its alread going
[14:52:25] <duch_kazatel> WELP.
[15:00:46] <Jdubs> hello
[15:01:16] <Jdubs> I'm having trouble with a CORS get request that is asking for an image file.  Would that be a server issue or something I need to account for in my $.ajax request?
[15:01:36] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue
[15:02:10] <Jdubs> No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin [Redacted] is therefore not allowed access.
[15:02:21] <Jdubs> when asking for the image
[15:02:42] <duch_kazatel> server issue.
[15:03:34] <Jdubs> what would need to be changed?
[15:03:46] <Jdubs> my backend guy is telling me it's not a server issue... -_-
[15:03:47] <duch_kazatel> !g enable cors
[15:03:49] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: enable cross-origin resource sharing → http://enable-cors.org/
[15:03:55] <Jdubs> we have cors enabled
[15:04:05] <Jdubs> we use cors for everything at the moment, but for some reason this one request doesnt work
[15:04:29] <Jdubs> it's the only one where an image is requested using ajax
[15:11:09] <shoky> what kind of request is it
[15:11:28] <shoky> get/post/?  any custom headers?
[15:11:48] <shoky> Jdubs ^
[15:12:06] <Jdubs> just a very simple $.ajax()  GET , dataType image
[15:12:54] <shoky> don't think image is a valid dataType
[15:13:05] <shoky> for $.ajax
[15:14:01] <Jdubs> :(
[15:14:09] <Jdubs> it used to work before we had cors :(
[15:14:17] <Jdubs> lol
[15:14:19] <Jdubs> Sign
[15:14:21] <Jdubs> Sigh*
[15:14:47] <shoky> well its probably not related to the image dataType
[15:14:53] <shoky> but that is something to check too
[15:15:40] <shoky> you say other requests do cors fine.. would help to see the failing code, and example of succeeding code
[15:18:08] <Jdubs> Hmm
[15:18:18] <Jdubs> i think it may have had to do with the data type actually
[15:18:28] <Jdubs> i changed to an XHR and requested it as blob and it seems to work i think.
[15:20:31] <Jdubs> ahh nevermind doesnt work
[15:20:32] <Jdubs> :/
[15:22:25] <shoky> what're you trying to do anyways
[15:23:14] <waspinator> I'm trying to show a fullCalendar after a hidden <div> is shown using the render method, but I'm not sure how to make it fadeIn or SlideIn. Right now it just pops into existance. any ideas?
[15:23:16] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/sxfyd/10/
[15:23:57] <Jdubs> shoky check if an image exists
[15:29:29] <shoky> Jdubs why not use a <img> or Image ?
[15:29:54] <Jdubs> because this is in the javascript to test if the image exists before it runs some code, it's not in the HTML
[15:30:22] <Jdubs> this is legacy code that I don't fully understand to be honest, i just want to restore the functionality
[15:30:35] <shoky> var i = new Image(); i.onload=function(){..}; i.onerror=function(){..}; i.src=...;
[15:31:13] <Jdubs> hmmm never seen that before...how do you trigger the load?
[15:31:23] <shoky> setting the src triggers it
[15:31:30] <Jdubs> cool, ill try that :)

[15:34:59] <Aveeen> hello!
[15:35:09] <marcusmoore> I just want to know how to get the message that I sent from the controller
[15:35:14] <Aveeen> what's the difference between jQuery.ajax and $.ajax() by itself?
[15:35:40] <duch_kazatel> Aveeen you mean jQuery.ajax() and $.ajax()?
[15:35:56] <Aveeen> yes
[15:36:00] <duch_kazatel> nothing.
[15:36:02] <duch_kazatel> they are the same.
[15:36:10] <Aveeen> oh okay
[15:36:11] <duch_kazatel> $ aliases to jQuery
[15:36:25] <Aveeen> ohh I see great thank you
[15:37:07] <kwiz_> Right, I'm just trying to get examples of showbizpro to work.  All I get is this http://kwameshorter.com/eric-neitzer
[15:37:49] <kwiz_> It should be the modern skin for showbizpro
[15:38:01] <duch_kazatel> you look at your console?
[15:38:53] <kwiz_> Yeah, the scripts aren't load from in the right place.

[15:51:21] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out how to fire this function whenever a button is clicked. I've got all the code setup, but I think I'm screwing up event binding (I never really mastered it). Can anyone take a peek and tell me what I'm doing wrong? (bottom of the js section) http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/DCmtI
[15:51:32] <CorySimmons> It's pretty bare bones.
[15:52:07] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[15:54:00] <CorySimmons> nevermind, i just put the bumpIt() function inside
[15:54:05] <CorySimmons> I was trying to do a "callback"
[15:54:14] <sga3a> I am injecting my version of jQuery and a jQuery plugin on a random webpage (bbc.com). However, I keep getting somePlugin() method is undefined when I call $('a').somePlugin();
[15:54:16] <CorySimmons> Where I waited for the event to finish, then fire the function
[15:54:40] <duch_kazatel> http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/DCmtI
[15:54:52] <sga3a> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23095798/jquery-jquery-plugin-not-defined-when-injected-on-a-page-with-multiple-or-confl
[15:54:55] <duch_kazatel> and you're still doing a callback.
[15:55:20] <duch_kazatel> but there's my examle.
[15:55:52] <sga3a> I suspect that it is being conflicted with multiple jQuery versions on the page, and that the plugin doesn't get added to the appropriate jQuery, hence failing.
[15:56:07] <duch_kazatel> sga3a why are you loading multiple versions of jquery?
[15:56:13] <CorySimmons> duch_kazatel: Here's what I was doing before: http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/tLAIB/
[15:56:17] <sga3a> duch_kazatel: bbc.com is
[15:56:18] <CorySimmons> ln 20 on the js
[15:56:36] <sga3a> duch_kazatel: I am trying to inject jQuery and jQuery plugin on a bbc.com page
[15:56:51] <sga3a> duch_kazatel: it works on other websites but not bbc.com and some others
[15:57:07] <sga3a> My guess is that it's caused by jQuery conflict...although not 100% certain
[15:57:24] <CorySimmons> duch_kazatel: I thought a callback was when you completed an event, then fired code. I thought this was how to do it
[15:57:47] <duch_kazatel> CorySimmons right...  you "call back" to a function.
[15:59:07] <duch_kazatel> CorySimmons http://codepen.io/anon/pen/AniBf
[15:59:21] <duch_kazatel> you put your function call in the wrong place.
[16:03:14] <sga3a> any ideas on why a jQuery plugin will not be defined when it is injected on the current page?
[16:05:56] <CrazyZurfer> I'm back
[16:07:24] <Diaz> hinbody, I'm trying to make an interactive cannon which would shoot cannonballs using canvas+jquery, so far I've got this demo: http://jsfiddle.net/W24fS/2/  but instead of the cannonball just appearing as you click, how would I get my "cannon" to shoot out a straight projectile disappearing offscreen?
[16:07:41] <CorySimmons> duch_kazatel: But that won't always wait until animations are complete right?
[16:08:12] <duch_kazatel> CorySimmons nope.  the previous syntax was invalid.  if you want to wait, do it in the done callback of the animations.
[16:09:10] <CorySimmons> duch_kazatel: Ah I see
[16:09:44] <Diaz> sorry hinbody didn't want to nickalert you, hi*
[16:16:08] <sga3a> okay  I simplified the question quite a bit. Can someone take a look? I've been at it all day
[16:16:09] <sga3a> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23096216/why-isnt-the-following-jquery-plugin-defined-consistently-on-different-websites
[16:19:19] <duch_kazatel> sga3a because jquery isn't available to you on the page.
[16:21:00] <sga3a> duch_kazatel: I included the jQuery as well
[16:21:10] <sga3a> duch_kazatel: updated it
[16:26:42] <TViernion> can i use jquery's load() function to reload a certain div from the current page?
[16:33:21] <dkog> Tips on wrapping a Deferred object in another?
[16:33:37] <dkog> Specifically I want to take a jqXHR and consider some specific success states as failure cases.
[16:33:52] <dkog> e.g. if the response has the word "ERROR" in it
[16:35:35] <dkog> So... If I just intercept always(), done(), fail(), and pass them all thru, does that suffice?
[16:36:19] <dkog> and then()
[16:36:39] <dkog> or at least that would work for a promise?
[16:59:48] <kbouwser> Anyone familiar with jquery ui sortable? running into an issue

[17:11:22] <kbouwser> tandroid when I click and hold to drag an image, all of a sudden the entire row drops
[17:11:42] <kbouwser> tandroid it seems as though when i click and hold an image to drag, a margin top is being applied to the whole row
[17:11:56] <tandroid> Can you create an example?
[17:16:59] <kbouwser> tandroid https://www.dropbox.com/s/xqp7h86cq6f7oa2/jquery-ui-sortable.mov
[17:17:06] <kbouwser> tandroid made a quick 10 sec screencast for u
[17:19:53] <tandroid> I'm not sure how to debug that since I can't see any code.
[17:50:08] <rohit> Hey guys
[17:50:21] <Guest60238> I have a question I am hoping one of you can answer
[17:50:51] <duch_kazatel> then ask it.
[17:51:26] <Guest60238> For the older releases of jquery, I see jquery.js and jquery.min.js included in the src on github
[17:51:43] <Guest60238> Are these actual release files?
[17:51:46] <duch_kazatel> yes
[17:51:52] <duch_kazatel> one is minified, one is not.
[17:52:02] <Guest60238> Thanks.
[17:52:11] <tw2113> which is which duch_kazatel, i'm confused
[17:52:20] <tachy0n> anyone know how to set window.blur listener but check if its a tab switch of browser or an element focus change on page (i.e. swf)?
[17:52:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:52:32] <tw2113> >:)
[17:52:37] <duch_kazatel> hah
[17:53:38] <Guest60238> I am trying to run unit tests for different versions of jquery. So if I checkout a particular tag of jquery and copy these release files to dist/ and run the tests, it should work, right?
[17:54:25] <duch_kazatel> wut
[17:54:30] <Guest60238> I can't build the older versions of jquery due to absence of older dependencies for grunt
[17:54:40] <duch_kazatel> the tests may change from version to version.
[17:54:42] <duch_kazatel> soooo.
[17:55:39] <Guest60238> For a release, the tests and src should be in sync. Should if I sync to release time, tests should match src
[17:55:54] <Guest60238> Am I wrong?
[18:09:27] <duch_kazatel> that dude was nuts
[18:09:34] <duch_kazatel> CaffeineCoding.
[18:09:36] <duch_kazatel> holy woah
[18:13:24] <dkog> you are amazingly patient
[18:14:05] <duch_kazatel> i feel bad for him, but wowzer.
[18:14:17] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i am shutting down for the evening.
[18:14:19] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[18:15:15] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a horizontal scrollbar using jquery that will work with mouse and autostarts?
[18:35:43] <wa5ted> ahhhhh #jquery
[18:43:32] <Velveeta> damn, i missed whatever it was that caffeinecoding was asking
[18:46:28] <hpekdemir> hi. I want to add two numbers to two tds in a table/tbody.
[18:46:30] <hpekdemir> this is my nopaste: http://nopaste.info/0d2849c7ac.html
[18:46:38] <hpekdemir> but only the last number is assigned.
[18:46:42] <hpekdemir> how can I put 1 in the first td and 2 in the second?
[18:57:59] <Velveeta> hpekdemir: you're iterating over your array of numbers, and inside that loop, iterating over each td and assigning the number from the current iteration to that (each) td, so that's why you'll get the last number assigned to both (each) td
[18:58:33] <Velveeta> you could try something like replacing your td.each loop with something like td.eq(index).html(id);
[18:59:02] <Velveeta> that'll grab td 0 for the first iteration, and td 1 for the second, and assign 1 and 2 to them, respectively
[19:31:30] <hpekdemir> Velveeta: it works.
[19:31:34] <hpekdemir> very good. thanks.
[19:32:24] <Velveeta> awesome, no problem
[19:33:09] <jphase> Velveeta: have you done much console debugging on android devices via the new chrome USB inspector?
[19:33:20] <jphase> if any
[19:36:31] <Velveeta> nope, not at all yet
[19:37:43] <jphase> dang, my console all of a sudden went white when on all/any of my devices and mr google says no one else in the world has had the same issue. oh well, I'll wait until the new version I guess
[19:38:23] <Velveeta> you can try installing canary
[19:38:43] <jphase> oh yeah! thanks!
[19:40:48] <CorySimmons> hey guys, I'm trying to figure out how to store the clearfix code in a variable and inject it into other .css({ … }) calls. I know it'd be best to use css and just add that class to things, but I don't want this script to depend on external css files at all. Anyone have any ideas?
[19:42:48] <jphase> Velveeta: of course that did the trick, e-five!
[19:43:09] <tw2113> what the cheese is going on here Velveeta ?
[19:43:21] <Velveeta> huzzah!
[19:43:28] <CorySimmons> Here's what I've got going on so far: http://jsfiddle.net/pGLy3/2/
[19:43:34] <Velveeta> tw2113: i don't know, i've been mostly afk on here for weeks :)
[19:43:36] <CorySimmons> I'd expect the block to be red
[19:43:57] <tw2113> explains the lack of wine
[19:44:18] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/pGLy3/3/
[19:44:31] <Velveeta> corysimmons: ^^ you should also probably wrap that in a document.ready block
[19:44:42] <Velveeta> the $('div') portion anyway
[19:45:53] <CorySimmons> Velveeta: Thanks!
[19:45:59] <Velveeta> no problemo
[19:46:04] <CorySimmons> Doesn't jsfiddle automatically doc.ready it?
[19:46:09] <Velveeta> nope
[19:46:10] <CorySimmons> "onLoad" top left dropdown
[19:46:25] <CorySimmons> ?
[19:46:28] <Velveeta> well, in that case, maybe?
[19:46:30] <CorySimmons> hehe
[19:46:41] <Velveeta> but you should still protect your dom-relevant code w/ document ready
[19:46:47] <CorySimmons> there's also an "onDomReady" but i'm not sure which is correct
[19:47:00] <CorySimmons> yup, thanks again velveeta, works like a charm
[19:54:29] <CorySimmons> why do i get the document back when i try $('.foo').ready(function() { console.log($(this)); }); ?
[19:54:38] <CorySimmons> I'd expect to get back the .foo element
[19:54:50] <relipse> i converted my drag drop functions to jquery but now ev.dataTransfer.setData("Text",                ev.target.id); is not working
[19:55:06] <CorySimmons> i should mention this is nested in a $(function() { … });
[19:55:18] <CorySimmons> is ready getting that?
[19:59:31] <relipse> why wouldn't you CorySimmons
[19:59:59] <relipse> $(function( this should be the main dom object, right? ));
[20:00:15] <relipse> and what are you trying to accomplish
[20:08:25] <Velveeta> corysimmons: there's no such thing as a ready event for standard elements, that event handler deals with the domready event, so it's going to be executed in the context of the document
[20:27:33] <CorySimmons> Velveeta: How can I pass a function to a selector then? Does it have to be one of the pre-written functions or can it be a generic function?
[20:28:41] <CorySimmons> something like .load or .ready but for a selector
[20:29:05] <CorySimmons> like $('.foo').ready(function() { doSomething(); doSomethingElse(); });
[20:31:56] <CorySimmons> .each seems to work for my purposes
[20:35:24] <relipse> $('.foo').myPlugin({ onChange:function(){ this ? }} <--- in writing a plugin, how do i pass the current .foo element to the onChange() function
[20:38:59] <shoky> relipse: with .call or .apply  for example:  $.fn.myPlugin = function(options) { return this.each(function() { ... options.onChange.call(this); ... }); }
[20:39:32] <shoky> ?g mdn call @ relipse
[20:39:34] <b-ot> relipse: Paul Washer Believes In The Holy Spirit - YouTube → http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-7Z2cQbb3k
[20:39:38] <shoky> o_O
[20:39:40] <relipse> what?
[20:39:49] <relipse> lol
[20:40:01] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[20:40:11] <relipse> yeah i see that let me test it
[20:42:09] <relipse> shoky: it's not working: https://gist.github.com/relipse/10803961#file-colorpicker-js-L71
[20:42:28] <relipse> go to line 71, that is where i'm trying to modify to get the original object being applied to
[20:45:57] <relipse> any idea?
[20:46:46] <CorySimmons> Velveeta: actually nm, .each doesn't work. http://i.imgur.com/bwzAoDa.png the first result is console.log($(this)) within .each, the second is console.log($('[jeet-center]')). they're different..
[20:47:09] <relipse> paste your code CorySimmons
[20:48:47] <relipse> i'm sorry its not line 71, its line 96
[20:48:54] <shoky> relipse: what's not working exactly?
[20:49:00] <relipse> i want to get the original object passed through the onchnage function
[20:49:14] <CorySimmons> relipse: http://pastie.org/9083818
[20:49:41] <shoky> relipse: what original object?
[20:49:51] <relipse> http://pastebin.com/W7jiGuqb
[20:50:08] <shoky> relipse: what original object?
[20:50:25] <relipse> whatever is currently element in .colorPicker
[20:50:59] <relipse> i want to change the background color , and not have duplicate code
[20:51:09] <shoky> you pass whatever you want.. you're currently passing: onChange.apply(cal, [col, HSBToHex(col), HSBToRGB(col)]);
[20:51:24] <relipse> no thats not my code, but i think i need to modify it did you see my pastebin
[20:51:26] <shoky> and it's getting passed fine
[20:51:29] <shoky> huh?
[20:51:38] <relipse> http://pastebin.com/W7jiGuqb
[20:51:42] <shoky> what's not working
[20:51:54] <shoky> what is callee? only 3 arguments are passed
[20:52:03] <relipse> that is a 4th argument i was trying to pass
[20:52:10] <relipse> i need to get the current element inside that onChange function
[20:52:12] <shoky> that's not what you said ...
[20:52:16] <shoky> you said you wanted to pass "this"
[20:52:18] <intellilogic> I was wondering if there was a way to "set settings" for $.ajax.  For example make all requests POST
[20:52:26] <relipse> i thought "this" would of been correct but its not
[20:52:35] <shoky> you just want to pass another element?
[20:52:37] <relipse> i tried it already it gets me the window object
[20:52:40] <shoky> er, another argument
[20:53:06] <relipse> yes i want to extend or modify the code so that the onChange() passes the current .colorSelector element
[20:53:11] <relipse> since there are multiple
[20:53:32] <shoky> change that line cal.data('colorpicker').onChange.apply(cal, [col, HSBToHex(col), HSBToRGB(col)]);
[20:53:42] <shoky> add whatever arguments you want there
[20:53:46] <shoky> to those 3
[20:54:00] <shoky> and they'll be passed as additional arguments
[20:54:37] <relipse> i know that but how do i get the "current element within .colorSelector list of elements?
[20:55:19] <shoky> you want to know what to add in that line?
[20:55:22] <relipse> or for example if the selector was .foobar
[20:55:33] <relipse> yes
[20:55:47] <relipse> $('.foobar') <-- iterates through all elements
[20:56:11] <shoky> uhh
[20:56:16] <shoky> probably just pass "this"
[20:56:20] <relipse> didnt work
[20:56:22] <shoky> as a 4th argument
[20:56:24] <relipse> gave me the window object
[20:56:37] <shoky> you passed this? or you used "this" in your onChange callback?
[20:56:49] <relipse> i passed it from the author's code as a 4th argument
[20:56:53] <shoky> i mean change the line to  cal.data('colorpicker').onChange.apply(cal, [col, HSBToHex(col), HSBToRGB(col), this]);
[20:56:58] <relipse> yes i did that
[20:57:00] <relipse> it didnt work
[20:57:02] <shoky> then use the 4th argument
[20:57:05] <shoky> it was window?
[20:57:08] <relipse> yes
[20:57:31] <relipse> thanks for the help by the way
[20:57:49] <Velveeta> corysimmons: what is this.. i don't even..
[20:58:29] <relipse> That's what I was doing to ask
[20:58:45] <shoky> relipse then how do you explain this.. http://jsfiddle.net/7VpMb/
[20:58:54] <shoky> change something in an input
[20:58:56] <Velveeta> for one thing, you can't target :before and :after with a jquery selector, those elements don't exist in the dom for targeting, they're pseudo-elements
[20:59:08] <zizzl> Hey guys can someone tell me what script they're using (or similar) that allows the title to gradually lose opacity at scroll http://couleecreative.com/ ... I know there's jQuery waypoints but that just triggers something when a div is reached, this is a gradual thing though
[20:59:13] <shoky> relipse: or in other words, "works for me"
[21:00:28] <shoky> relipse: or if you want the whole thing then it was already passed for you as "this"
[21:00:39] <relipse> no its the wrong item
[21:00:42] <relipse> look
[21:01:03] <relipse> http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/#about
[21:01:07] <tw2113> this or $(this) ?
[21:01:10] <shoky> what item do you want
[21:01:22] <shoky> relipse why would i look there
[21:01:24] <Velveeta> corysimmons: also, yes, console.log of $(this)  and of $('[jeet-center]') are going to display different things... one of them is outputting a single object in that collection, and the other is outputting the entire collection... .each() is working just fine there...
[21:01:28] <relipse> search Attached to DOMElem
[21:01:36] <relipse> see the blue color
[21:01:56] <relipse> thats $('#colorSelector').ColorPicker({
[21:02:06] <shoky> huh? so..?
[21:02:07] <relipse> see that code the author has
[21:02:22] <shoky> i donno where you're going with this dude
[21:02:26] <shoky> what's your point?
[21:02:42] <relipse> i need the #colorSelector element without having to type #colorSelector like the author did
[21:03:03] <relipse> not the color picker actually created
[21:04:09] <relipse> see he writes $('#colorSelector div').css(
[21:04:12] <relipse> inside the .onChange
[21:04:21] <relipse> why can't he instead do $(this).find('div')
[21:05:14] <relipse> i think i need to just go to bed and wake up happier
[21:05:24] <zizzl> anyone able to help?
[21:05:34] <relipse> fo shizzle
[21:05:50] <CorySimmons> Velveeta: I know it's working like it's supposed to, but how can I get the selector like console.log($('[jeet-center]')) is getting?
[21:06:16] <shoky> relipse because it's not the same element, sec
[21:06:27] <relipse> ok i'll wait :)
[21:08:31] <shoky> relipse: cal.data('colorpicker').el
[21:08:55] <relipse> love you
[21:08:58] <shoky> as you can see in the init function it sets  options.el = this
[21:09:02] <relipse> ok maybe not that much but thanks
[21:09:06] <shoky> ;p
[21:09:58] <CorySimmons> actually nevermind, i don't need it
[21:10:32] <relipse> var el = this.data('colorpicker').el;
[21:10:36] <relipse> that worked thanks
[21:10:44] <shoky> np
[21:11:10] <shoky> relipse i just meant you could send cal.data('colorpicker').el  as the 4th argument
[21:11:21] <relipse> its fine i'd rather not modify the author's code
[21:11:25] <shoky> your way is fine too yeah
[21:21:22] <shoky> zizzl they're not using any script for that.. just changing opacity on scroll using basic math
[21:21:50] <zizzl> shoky where are they doing that.. I'd love to learn off it
[21:22:06] <shoky> their code isn't very pretty, donno if i'd recommend that
[21:22:11] <shoky> but.. http://couleecreative.couleecreative.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/couleecreativeV6.05-child/js/init.js?ver=3.9
[21:22:21] <shoky> search for parallax slider
[21:22:51] <shoky> there are some scroll handlers set up there.. doing a bunch of stuff including changing opacities
[21:23:51] <zizzl> is there an example of this from someone doing a tutorial of sorts?
[21:24:52] <shoky> i donno but i can make you a quick example
[21:25:07] <shoky> just for the opacity thing
[21:30:24] <shoky> zizzl: http://jsfiddle.net/22exm/
[21:31:20] <tripflex> could anybody look at this and let me know if they see what the problem could be
[21:31:22] <tripflex> https://github.com/tripflex/d3-js/blob/master/eventdata.js#L140
[21:31:43] <tripflex> i'm trying to get all of the attributes from an xml document
[21:31:49] <tripflex> from one of the nodes
[22:30:52] <Feel> Hello. Help me please. I have error "undefined is not a function", when use $(this), but before erro in console.log I see that $(this) is Object object. Why I get error and how to solve this problem?
[22:31:48] <tandroid> $(this) changes based on context
[22:31:51] <Uhkis> Feel: make a jsfiddle
