[04:56:35] <cuci> hi guys! I'm using QUnit for some tests like so: https://gist.github.com/354546abdd41261739012b95fd9e4182
[04:56:46] <cuci> but on ff only the first one gets run
[04:56:50] <cuci> one chrome both
[04:56:59] <cuci> any ideas how to run them both on ff also ?
[05:07:51] <Cork> cuci: wait, only one of the QUnit.test runs in firefox?
[05:07:56] <Cork> that sounds weird
[05:08:40] <Cork> have you tried testing other things so it isn't just the specificity of those tests causing the problem?
[05:27:55] <spidamoo> hi guys
[05:28:08] <spidamoo> this was bothering me for years
[05:28:17] <spidamoo> and I decided to finally ask
[05:28:27] <spidamoo> why search on api.jquery.com does not work?
[05:28:55] <spidamoo> I mean it's either 'no result' or always the same result independent of what I actually searched
[05:29:02] <spidamoo> does this make sense to anyone?
[05:29:31] <Cork> spidamoo: it works but ya it very often matches way to widely
[05:29:55] <Cork> ex. http://api.jquery.com/?s=grep
[05:30:58] <Cork> so it depends on what you search for, sometimes it is commonly referenced in a lot of pages and becomes close to impossible to search for (like on)
[05:31:00] <spidamoo> it's probably the first example I see that did not match (maybe almost) everything
[05:31:20] <spidamoo> usually I search for something that I know is a name of function
[05:31:31] <spidamoo> like 'get' or 'ajax' or 'click' or 'width'
[05:31:49] <spidamoo> and it's always like 100 results so basically useless
[05:32:11] <Cork> ya, it is cause they are commonly used words in the page content
[05:33:04] <spidamoo> well I think the real problem here is not that it includes everything even remotely relevant, that's okay in itself
[05:33:26] <spidamoo> the problem is it's not sorted by relevance but in alphabetical order
[05:34:27] <spidamoo> I mean if the first result was 100% match of page title with the search query that would be good enough for me
[05:38:27] <Cork> spidamoo: well it is more like the different kind of matches in the page needed to be rated by relevancy
[05:38:36] <Cork> and obviously that isn't the case right now
[05:40:45] <FilipNortic> and no matter how much work you but i odds are google will give better results anyway
[05:41:21] <Cork> possibly, but actually not guaranteed
[05:44:16] <FilipNortic> not much is guaranteed. but I amost never even try to use internal searchengiens anymore unless they are typeahead or for some reason my only option
[05:45:10] <Cork> well many sites that use google search breaks from time to time prob cause the api changes or something (so you get no results at all)
[05:45:25] <Cork> so i'm actually not a big fan of embedded google search
[05:47:15] <FilipNortic> yeah me neither. If i can't find a link to what i want in the page i usally open up a new tab and do a new search in google
[05:55:48] <cuci> Cork: it gets funnier only that test runs even if I add another before it
[05:56:00] <cuci> am I missing an ; or similar  there ?
[05:58:04] <Cork> cuci: hmm, you are defining some global variables
[05:58:32] <Cork> (coloane, glicemii, div)
[05:59:48] <cuci> ok I added var to them, but the same thing happens
[06:00:03] <Cork> ya, didn't expect them to be the cause
[06:00:58] <Cork> cuci: https://jsfiddle.net/opntz728/
[06:01:06] <Cork> so it doesn't seam to be a generic problem
[06:02:30] <cuci> yeah I think it's a typo in my code that will haunt me for weeks
[06:02:44] <Cork> cuci: well check the browser console
[06:02:57] <Cork> it should normally display there
[06:04:22] <cuci> yeah I've got nothing there
[06:04:43] <Cork> you could try adding "use strict"; at the beginning of the file
[06:04:54] <Cork> that might possible make it throw exceptions
[06:11:54] <cuci> I did just that, complained about declaring div, removed that then I got back to square 1
[06:25:49] <Cork> doesn't sound like a typo then
[07:39:02] <__hassoon__> guys anyone around ?
[07:44:10] <Cork> __hassoon__: don't ask for ppl, ask the question and wait for if someone has an answer, else ppl have to ask for the question, and might not have time to wait for it
[07:46:39] <__hassoon__> i seriously need to find and set up a multi-file upload plugin (preferably working with jquery) that does not require ajax, and i can't figure out how to use this fineuploader plugin, it's a mess
[07:46:56] <__hassoon__> e.g https://fineuploader.com/
[07:47:27] <Cork> ug, if you don't want ajax just use a straight form
[07:47:43] <Cork> <input type="file" multiple>
[07:48:31] <Cork> there isn't a need for a plugin to support file uploads unless you want to do it through ajax
[07:49:24] <__hassoon__> Cork: yeah it's just about sorting multiple on-demand files in some list with drag 'n drop support, then letting files get saved with the form submit
[07:49:45] <Cork> dnd support already exists for the file input
[07:50:02] <Cork> if you want to have so it can be dropped anywhere on the page it requires some work though
[07:50:18] <Cork> but really, it is prob better to just write it from scratch, it isn't that hard
[07:51:07] <Cork> (actually i'm not sure you can support drop files on the page for straight form posts, as you can't modify file inputs from js)
[07:51:43] <Cork> btw, why is no ajax a requirement?
[07:52:12] <__hassoon__> Cork: 'cause my boss wants it that way, d'oh
[07:52:18] <Cork> ...
[07:52:30] <__hassoon__> Cork: yep.
[07:54:38] <__hassoon__> Cork: and what's the ... for ?
[07:54:47] <Cork> __hassoon__: ya, looked around a bit and i'm not 100% sure, but i'm quite sure you can scratch the dnd feature
[07:54:52] <Cork> cause it requires ajax
[07:55:11] <Cork> dnd works by an event listener on the page and it gives you a file list as part of the event object
[07:55:24] <__hassoon__> yeah the jqueryUI is full fo that
[07:55:27] <__hassoon__> * of *
[07:55:32] <Cork> so send it to the server you need to make it part of the post and this is done through the FormData object for ajax
[07:55:47] <__hassoon__> yeah he insists on not using an ajax solution
[07:55:48] <__hassoon__> ahah
[07:55:48] <Cork> for full page posts there is no place to put that file so it can
[07:55:55] <Cork> *'t be supported
[07:56:30] <Cork> __hassoon__: that's fine, but you have to make sure he understands the consequences
[07:56:46] <FilipNortic> aslong as you're not doing any cors ajax i can't see how anyone would even tell.
[07:56:48] <Cork> __hassoon__: my recommended solution is to have the page work with straight posts, and then use ajax if you have js
[07:56:56] <Cork> and through that allow dnd and so on
[07:57:42] <Cork> cause i think i see where your boss is comming from, he wants the form to work without js, and that is actually a good thing
[07:57:59] <Cork> but that doesn't mean you have to forbid ajax, just that the form is usable without it
[07:59:00] <Cork> __hassoon__: so i would recommend starting with verifying why the ajax comment was made
[07:59:31] <Cork> __hassoon__: and if it is what i suspect, do a feature enhancement solution instead
[07:59:55] <__hassoon__> Cork: i might go with coding something from scratch too, d'oh
[07:59:56] <Cork> (so have a working form and bind a submit event on the form and do ajax from there, then you have both)
[08:00:07] <Cork> __hassoon__: dnd is still a nogo though
[08:02:03] <Cork> ya, just verified the filelist from input lists are readonly
[08:02:13] <Cork> so you can't do dnd for straight posts
[08:02:15] <Cork> not possible
[11:27:49] <Qiller> hi! how can i hide <tr> tag after click by attr id data-id? Getting and finding clicked data-id and hide <tr> tag. https://jsfiddle.net/s6b4m5sa/
[11:33:18] <__hassoon__> Qiller: just apply .hide() on the tr having a certain data-id using data("id")
[11:36:48] <KevinCarbonara> Is anyone here familiar with jquery.printElement?
[11:45:16] <Qiller> hi! how can i hide <tr> tag after click by attr id data-id? Getting and finding clicked data-id and hide <tr> tag. https://jsfiddle.net/s6b4m5sa/
[11:50:27] <GoSox> ok i'm having a weird problem. i'm trying to handle submitting an actual html form in jquery. If the event handler has something like alert('hi"); $e.preventDefault(); it functions normally
[11:51:03] <GoSox> but when i try to get the value of an input, by name, with the following line, the whole handler stops and the form submits normally... but i don't get any errors in the console
[11:51:04] <GoSox> 		var $flag_url = $("input[name=lookup_flag_by_url").val();
[11:51:43] <GoSox> ah i see missing closing brackets
[11:51:47] <GoSox> and fixing them fixed the script.
[11:52:04] <GoSox> so the question is... why was it not throwing any error before
[12:49:50] <GoSox> Ok whole new thing. I just noticed that when i use $(form-input).val(""); to 'erase' the content of a form element, the placeholder text doesn't automatically go back. It's left truely blank until it loses focus, which is not the normal behavior
[12:51:41] <robertmaxrees> for your first question about why no errors, jquery can't assume your selector is necesarily invalid in some cases.  it's a blessing/curse that it hides some of that stuff away.
[12:52:21] <GoSox> robertmaxrees: yeah but the problem wasn't just that nothing was happening, because my selector was invalid. It was halting script execution after the bad selector.
[12:52:36] <GoSox> without any errors
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4cmaw6zp/
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> doesn't halt the script here.
[12:53:20] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what the issue would've beem
[12:53:48] <GoSox> i dunno ive since moved on. its working now so just put it on the list of unsolved mysteries
[12:54:19] <robertmaxrees> as for your second question, i'm missing some context.
[12:54:28] <robertmaxrees> not sure how the focus plays into it.
[12:54:47] <robertmaxrees> 'cause, like - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4cmaw6zp/1/
[12:55:08] <GoSox> gimme a few minutes. once i get the real functionality working, ill see if i can make a misbehaving mockup
[12:55:40] <robertmaxrees> taking that example a step further; https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4cmaw6zp/2/
[12:55:47] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[12:57:07] <GoSox> yeah it works right on my mockup too https://jsfiddle.net/4cmaw6zp/3/
[12:57:26] <GoSox> but in my real script, i was getting a blank input, then if i clicked off and on it, then the placeholder would show up
[12:57:37] <GoSox> oh well, i'm moving on from this one too
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> you using some kind of polyfill?
[12:57:42] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:57:48] <GoSox> huh?
[12:59:22] <robertmaxrees> some browsers don't support the placeholder attribute.
[12:59:28] <robertmaxrees> wondering if many you have a misbehaving polyfill.
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> but you seem to just accept that it's bugged so (shrug)
[12:59:52] <GoSox> i don't know what the term polyfill means. but i'm in the most current Safari, it definitely supports placeholder
[13:00:39] <robertmaxrees> polyfill is a piece of code that adds in missing/corrects functionality that's standard.
[13:01:48] <robertmaxrees> so like, you'd add a polyfill for the placeholder attribute for browsers that don't support it.  but that polyfill might be poorly written
[13:03:03] <GoSox> ok yeah its still doing it. my script submits a form using $.post, prevents default, does what i want with the data it gets from the post, and then it sets the input to "" (an empty string) to clear it. when this happens, the input does not have focus, and there is no text or placeholder. I have to click in it to get it focus, then suddenly the placeholder pops in
[13:03:46] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have some other event bindings acting up.
[13:03:50] <GoSox> is there a better way to 'empty' an input, like .empty() ?
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> .val('') is the way to do it.
[13:04:18] <robertmaxrees> .empty() isn't what you want.
[13:04:58] <GoSox> im going to try to cheat.... hold on
[13:05:14] <GoSox> (this is just for the sites admin page so i don't want to go too crazy getting it just perfect)
[13:05:46] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:07:51] <GoSox> hahaha
[13:08:33] <GoSox> $("#form_id input[name=input_namel]").val("").focus().blur();
[13:09:01] <GoSox> as far as hack fixes, thats about the least hackey hacks you can get, i'm happy with it. and it toally works. input gets cleared and the placeholder comes right back
[13:09:20] <robertmaxrees> heh, so long as you're happy.
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd be more concerned about the lurking bugs but (shrug)
[13:13:01] <gui1> Hi
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:20:32] <taplar_> i didn't realize robert was such a sheryl crow fan
[13:20:40] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:20:42] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[13:21:18] <taplar_> took me a minute to remember her name.  i kept wanting to say shania
[13:24:27] <KevinCarbonara> twain
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> mark
[13:25:00] <taplar_> lol
[13:25:07] <taplar_> wow, great minds man
[14:37:29] <Es0teric> when looping through an object, how do i get the name of the key inside an object?
[14:38:16] <robertmaxrees> what are you using to loop?
[14:38:24] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees $.each()
[14:39:13] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/#jQuery-each-object-callback
[14:39:19] <robertmaxrees> Type: Function( String propertyName, Object valueOfProperty )
[14:39:37] <Es0teric> duh
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:39:44] <Es0teric> shit man my brain is not even here cono
[14:39:55] <robertmaxrees> all good.
[14:57:14] <taplar_> sheep dip man
[15:39:08] <aias> how do you smooth scroll between #anchors?
[16:21:06] <aias> ok i used this http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/dpBMVP
[16:35:14] <robertmaxrees> taplar_ hahahahahaha
[16:54:19] <Absolute0> Does $.click get called before $(document).on('click' even if the document one comes first?
[16:54:44] <robertmaxrees> probably?
[16:58:55] <Absolute0> the .click has a stopPropagation which is preventing the document.on(click from firing
[16:59:06] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[16:59:24] <Absolute0> but the document on click appears first
[16:59:28] <Absolute0> anyways I can make both work?
[16:59:30] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[16:59:46] <robertmaxrees> if you stop propagation on it, it never bubbles to the document.
[16:59:55] <Absolute0> Or only stop some of the events from propagating?
[17:00:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:00:13] <robertmaxrees> it stops that event from propagating.
[17:00:26] <Absolute0> like stop propagate but propogate to function X
[17:00:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:00:45] <robertmaxrees> that's conflating terminology heh
[17:01:12] <robertmaxrees> propagation in this context is strictly about the event bubbling.
[17:01:28] <robertmaxrees> so it stops the event from bubbling up the tree past the current point.
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[18:09:31] <Absolute0> is $('div').click() slower than $(document).on('click', 'div'...) if there are a lot of divs?
[18:12:33] <taplar_> slower is relative to the machine power
[18:12:41] <taplar_> the second one creates less bindings though
[18:20:37] <r3v3rb> anyone know why s[0] is always an HTMLDivElement and therefore unable to chain the .fadeIn() in this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4c7209447175edebf494e0b48bb2bea2 -- it's keeping me awake tonight!
[18:21:19] <taplar_> because that breaks out of the jQuery object
[18:21:52] <taplar_> jQuery objects are array like objects, so if you treat them like an array it will return the element at that offset, which is an Element
[18:22:10] <taplar_> if you want them to stay as jQuery objects, use eq(#) instead of array notation
[18:22:24] <r3v3rb> fixed! removed the find as its superfluous :D
[18:22:40] <r3v3rb> thanks taplar_ btw
[18:22:53] <r3v3rb> and targeted directly
[20:43:17] <Jonno_FTW> when I use <script defer src="...">, how can I trigger an event when it's finished loading?
[20:55:16] <Jonno_FTW> nvm
[22:05:21] <bluereign> Hello everyone. I am new to JS and have a questions about if else statements. Particularly, how this this be syntactically written?   ...   https://hastebin.com/oladesisaz
[22:12:10] <ngharo> bluereign: you're close.  MDN docs are a good resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm
[22:23:27] <bluereign> Thank you ngharo, that was very helpful!
[23:16:06] <whoisaCe> is there a way to split an element like the example: <p>Wine Name: Ducru-Beaucaillou</p> and return the values "wine name":"ducru-beaucaillou" either in a data attribute or array?
[23:17:07] <ngharo> element.text().split(":") is a start
[23:20:12] <whoisaCe> ngharo thats a great start, thanks!
