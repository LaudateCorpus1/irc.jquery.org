[04:26:58] <skywater> hi
[04:27:06] <skywater> question i have some td elements with an id of  row-item-1, row-description-1 ,row-extra-1  and the names are like item[1], description[1] etc.. there are like 10 of those elements.. Is there a simple way to iterate through these elements and add up the numbers 1,2,3,4
[04:27:38] <skywater> like split on the second - and take the digit and add +1
[04:33:12] <AdamPDotty> hmm, var sum = 0; $('td').each(function(td){ sum+= td.id.split('-')[2]; });
[04:33:17] <AdamPDotty> doable and might work

[05:16:02] <preference> anyone here familiar with owl carousel? my question is: if i do a series of <div>s and then nestle some <div>s inside them, will it only carousel the outer sets?
[05:38:20] <Ronaldho80[m]> Dear all, I have a problem using jquery ui dialog: I cannot drag it throughout the whole browser window. I get a "hidden border" at the middle of the screen. However, I can drag the dialog to the bottom and the screen scrolls down. Does any one know what is happening here?
[05:39:46] <skywater> hi

[05:42:21] <Ronaldho80[m]> This shows the problem: https://giphy.com/gifs/wHdOsobBmBackoS4JK

[06:17:40] <skywater> https://jsfiddle.net/uy7goprt/79/
[06:18:02] <skywater> why isnt the ids of the childs of the TD in the alert but instead the id of the TD element
[06:19:26] <skywater> got it nvm :)
[07:40:08] <dimi1979> I cannot find what is wrong with this syntax here:https://hastebin.com/qiwosuyaye.md
[07:52:25] <pavonia> dimi1979: Put your object properties into quotes: { "data-value": ... }
[07:52:50] <pavonia> Also you might want to use .data() instead of .attr()
[07:56:01] <dimi1979> I did not put them on quotes because I was doing it like the examlpe in the jqyery manual http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr-attributes
[07:58:05] <dimi1979> pavonia:why I should use data()....I do not get it
[08:03:20] <AdamPDotty> With attr() you try to change the HTML, which has long been rendered into a DOM.
[08:04:19] <AdamPDotty> It kind of works, because browser developers do not even expect coders to be sensible.
[08:21:03] <pavonia> dimi1979: `data-value' is not a JS identifier, so you have to use quotes there
[09:03:28] <olorin> hi, is it possible to have .find() looking aswell in itself (not only children)
[09:37:42] <pavonia> olorin: Try $(myelem).find(...).addBack()
[10:07:51] <olorin> ty pavonia
