[04:03:32] <bboy> Hi guys, I'm new to twitter api. I want to get the latest tweets on a specific account. Can someone show me how can I do it using postman?
[04:04:47] <Cork> don't double post
[06:56:09] <Guest11> Hey
[07:30:08] <Guest11> can anyone please help me with adding a simple check to my code
[07:32:28] <Robdgreat> Guest11: at the risk of being seen as volunteering, you're going to need to provide a bit more information for anyone to know what you're talking about
[07:33:07] <Robdgreat> if you actually describe your situation, someone able to help will be able to tell whether they're able to help or not
[07:33:15] <Robdgreat> as it stands, there's no real way to know for sure
[07:38:51] <Guest11> yeah, sorry, my bad
[07:43:15] <Guest11> I'm as rookie as it gets and with the help of the internet managed to come up with this script (https://codepen.io/selim99/pen/oNzVJeb) for my website. Only think left to do is to do is tomake sure you can not close a section by clicking on the same sections button. So you can switch between them, but one is always open. I know that a check if the
[07:43:15] <Guest11> current section has a class 'opened' will do it, i just dont know how to my self.
[07:43:16] <Cork> also, don't expect anyone to do your job for you, asking for help is about understanding how you should do it
[18:00:41] <GoldenHawk>  Hello! so i have this simple script --> https://jsfiddle.net/L6vuc8zh/ or https://pastebin.com/Y5Yhv5UM that adds a new input field on click.. but on console im getting this error --> Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function
[18:02:28] <robertmaxrees> GoldenHawk how are you loading jquery?  if so, how?
[18:02:44] <robertmaxrees> err, hahaha
[18:04:56] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: well is a wordpress site.. jquery is loaded by default... or at least is supouse to be loading...
[18:05:08] <robertmaxrees> that might be the issue - is jQuery defined?
[18:05:27] <robertmaxrees> try wrapping your code in jQuery(function($) { /* your code here 8? });
[18:08:03] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: ok i did that.. im still getting the exact same error..
[18:09:24] <robertmaxrees> can you share the page itself?
[18:10:02] <GoldenHawk> mm.. its on localhost...
[18:10:37] <robertmaxrees> view source and copy/paste the entire page then?
[18:11:13] <GoldenHawk> sure hold on
[18:13:31] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: https://pastebin.com/mwVjC1FJ
[18:14:37] <robertmaxrees> load up the page, go to your browser's dev tools, go to the console, and type in jQuery.fn.jquery
[18:14:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[18:16:16] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: "3.5.1"
[18:18:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[18:18:12] <robertmaxrees> then your code is likely firing before jquery is loaded.
[18:27:21] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: i just double check.. an this js is the last one to be loaded...
[18:27:50] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: you can see it at the source code.. is the las script to be loaded..
[18:28:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't see your code in the page source at all.
[18:30:25] <robertmaxrees> mind updating  that fiddle with the change I suggested?
[18:31:25] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: sure... on the source i found the <script> tag..
[18:32:18] <robertmaxrees> i can't find anything from the fiddle in the pastebin :shrug:
[18:33:04] <GoldenHawk> updated --> https://jsfiddle.net/L6vuc8zh/1/
[18:33:19] <GoldenHawk> yea the js code perse.. its not showing..
[18:33:27] <robertmaxrees> you need to wrap EVERYTHING with what i said.
[18:33:32] <robertmaxrees> not just the click handler.
[18:33:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause otherwise you're missing wrapper and add_button
[18:34:07] <GoldenHawk> damm... -.-   my mistake.. hold on
[18:34:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:34:50] <GoldenHawk> is working!!
[18:35:29] <GoldenHawk> robertmaxrees: thank you!
[18:36:03] <robertmaxrees> def :)
