[00:01:12] <ignaciogiri> hello guys
[00:01:23] <gnarf> ignaciogiri: oh hai!
[00:01:31] <ignaciogiri> can somebody see how can I do this with 3 segs interval? http://jsfiddle.net/mnMzJ/
[00:01:44] <ignaciogiri> each
[00:01:53] <gnarf> what is "3 segs"
[00:02:06] <gnarf> 3 seconds?
[00:02:12] <gnarf> that would be 3000 milliseconds
[00:02:24] <ignaciogiri> yes
[00:02:35] <gnarf> the second parameter (800) is ms
[00:02:37] <gnarf> make it 3000
[00:02:53] <snover> gnarf: where is your steely exterior?
[00:02:55] <ignaciogiri> the second parameter is the speed of the scroll
[00:03:15] <gnarf> snover: steely?
[00:03:23] <snover> steely
[00:03:33] <gnarf> I have a steely exterior?
[00:03:47] * gnarf looks @ coldhead, "Is that a good thing?"
[00:04:48] <gnarf> ignaciogiri: was that not what you wanted?
[00:05:06] <gnarf> ignaciogiri: did you want a 3 second pause between each?
[00:05:07] <ignaciogiri> gnarf: no, I want the speed I have, but with 3 segs interval each scroll
[00:05:11] <ignaciogiri> yes
[00:05:14] <gnarf> ?setTimeout @ignaciogiri
[00:05:15] <bot-t> ignaciogiri, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[00:06:33] <gnarf> ignaciogiri: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mnMzJ/1/
[00:06:44] <gnarf> note, that I also added the speed of the animation
[00:06:52] <ignaciogiri> gnarf: thanks dude
[00:07:03] * gnarf frowns
[00:08:14] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:08:27] <gnarf> ignaciogiri: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mnMzJ/2/
[00:08:46] <ignaciogiri> gnarf: that's pro
[00:10:58] <ignaciogiri> gnarf: thanks, all set now

[00:18:27] <foertel> hi guys
[00:22:14] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[00:23:30] <firebalrog> hello
[00:24:14] <wkmanire> I have a super basic question. Suppose I had a form with 4 buttons in it, one button for each of the common HTTP methods; GET, PUT, DELETE and POST. I'm supposed to set the method in the <form> element. Is it possible for the buttons to change which method is submitted without using javascript?
[00:24:19] <wkmanire> As in, marking up the buttons for instance.
[00:25:50] <wkmanire> ah, formmethod attribute.
[00:26:10] <firebalrog> $('#formid').attrib("method")="Delete";
[00:26:34] <firebalrog> try that
[00:26:43] <wkmanire> firebalrog: read my question again please.
[00:26:44] <gnarf> firebalrog: try that?
[00:26:47] <firebalrog> extra semicolo
[00:26:54] <gnarf> firebalrog: you're insane
[00:27:07] <gnarf> firebalrog: there a like 3 bugs in that line of code
[00:27:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://team.forsvarsmakten.se/english/#/private/g5S8o64bYX
[00:27:35] <firebalrog> typing in bed on ipad but you get the idea
[00:27:47] <ProLoser|Mobile> fire: click that link
[00:27:50] <ProLoser|Mobile> need 2 more people
[00:27:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> ipad would be hlepful
[00:28:01] <ProLoser|Mobile> wait nvm you can't do flash cuz your a luzer
[00:28:18] <wkmanire> wait, is formmethod new for hTML5?
[00:28:20] <gnarf> firebalrog: a) there is no method "attrib", b) even if you had gotten attr() right, its attr("method", "delete") -- c) if using jQuery 1.6 + you might wanna change the .prop() -- and d) you're mixing ' and " on the same line
[00:28:42] <wkmanire> ProLoser|Mobile: I clicked.
[00:28:59] <gnarf> wkmanire: without JS - no
[00:29:41] <wkmanire> gnarf: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/element/input
[00:29:49] <wkmanire> yeah, they have it listed here as HTML5.
[00:29:50] <wkmanire> *sigh*
[00:29:52] <ProLoser|Mobile> who's in pasadena
[00:31:07] <ProLoser|Mobile> vegas fucking sucks
[00:31:36] <firebalrog> yes it does
[00:31:37] <wkmanire> gnarf: I'm experimenting with "progressive" enhancement. So I'm having to learn some old markup patterns and such.
[00:31:44] <snover> you be nice, vegas has legal whores
[00:31:56] <wkmanire> snover: No it doesn't.
[00:32:02] <snover> the suburbs of vegas.
[00:32:06] <wkmanire> Nope
[00:32:10] <wkmanire> Its forbidden in clark county.
[00:32:12] <firebalrog> no it. doesnt parump does
[00:32:18] <wkmanire> You have to go to nye county for legal prostitution.
[00:32:29] <snover> LET’S NOT SPLIT HAIRS
[00:32:38] * wkmanire is a resident.
[00:32:51] <wkmanire> Pahrump is about an hour and a half from Veags.
[00:32:53] <wkmanire> Vegas*
[00:33:02] <firebalrog> well thats exactly what you want to do
[00:33:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> we need 1 more player who isn't las vegas http://team.forsvarsmakten.se/english/#/private/g5S8o64bYX
[00:33:14] <snover> A REASONABLE DISTANCE AWAY
[00:33:38] <firebalrog> lol
[00:33:52] <foertel> hm ... anyone ever had "Maximum call stack size exceeded" with jQuery.event.remove in latest jQuery and UI datepicker?
[00:33:53] <wkmanire> Welcome to Pahrump, we have brothels, illegal fireworks and retirement communities. .... .... ..... Now leaving pahrump. thanks for visiting!
[00:34:11] <firebalrog> lol
[00:34:27] <firebalrog> ryolite is neat though
[00:34:45] <firebalrog> got some nice photos there
[00:35:44] <wkmanire> Rhyolite?
[00:36:39] <wkmanire> foertel: Something recursed into oblivion.
[00:36:55] <foertel> yeah, but why ;)
[00:37:00] <wkmanire> foertel: Tell chrome to break on all exceptions and tell us what the callstack looks like
[00:37:12] <foertel> jQuery UI does not have issues with noConflict mode, does it?
[00:37:26] <snover> it would be hilarious if it did
[00:37:37] <firebalrog> yes sorry spelling is poor tonight
[00:37:54] <wkmanire> firebalrog: My spelling is always poor. :D
[00:38:01] <wkmanire> But at least my grammar is more gooder than my spelling.
[00:38:36] <firebalrog> :) thanks
[00:39:01] <Whirl3d> is window.location.hash an object or a string?
[00:39:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> HIT RECONNECT
[00:39:20] <wkmanire> So are there any old timers about? Was there a markup pattern that let you reuse form elements for different HTTP elements without javascript or do I just need to duplicate my markup for each HTTP method?
[00:39:34] <wkmanire> Whirl3d: I thought it was a string.
[00:40:11] <Whirl3d> me too, I am just being told that it doesn't have the method substr...so prolly a typo. Thanks for the reply
[00:40:50] <firebalrog> if you don't use any javascript i can't think of a way to do it.
[00:41:04] <snover> wkmanire: what is an http element?
[00:41:07] <wkmanire> I have a list of data items with checkboxes in a form. I'd like to allow the user to make a selection of them then click one button to delete them or another to update them.
[00:41:12] <wkmanire> bleh
[00:41:13] <wkmanire> good question
[00:41:16] <wkmanire> I meant HTML element.
[00:41:33] <wkmanire> But I want to use DELETE and PUT
[00:41:40] <wkmanire> Instead of POST and POST.
[00:42:42] <snover> wkmanire: not even html5 supports verbs other than GET and POST.
[00:43:22] <wkmanire> snover: Really? I'm gonna do a little experiment. One sec
[00:43:31] <foertel> is there a way to export the callstack in chrome for a readable format?
[00:43:43] <snover> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#attributes-1 yes really.
[00:43:48] <firebalrog> i don't recall even seeing anything with a method delete or put. i have seen curl. used with delete and put for some rest apps
[00:44:10] <firebalrog> i just mean the method on a form
[00:44:30] <snover> that is because it is impossible…
[00:46:04] <wkmanire> he he
[00:46:06] <wkmanire> Yep
[00:46:39] <firebalrog> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_form_method.asp.  get and post only
[00:46:48] <wkmanire> I did a quick little test with PHP and when I submitted a form with method="DELETE" from Chrome $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] was GET.
[00:46:59] <firebalrog> lol
[00:47:21] <snover> It’s a good thing that he left
[00:47:23] <foertel> var ret = matches.call( node, expr ); seems to be the problem
[00:47:25] <wkmanire> So how in the world do RESTful web services get around that?
[00:47:32] <snover> he was about to get a huge bitching out for linking to w3schools
[00:47:44] <snover> oh super, now I can bitch him out
[00:47:44] <wkmanire> he he
[00:47:52] <wkmanire> firebalrog: shame on you
[00:47:57] <wkmanire> snover is gonna eat ya
[00:48:08] <firebalrog> what did i do
[00:48:11] <snover> firebalrog: worst. reference. ever. http://w3fools.com/
[00:48:16] <wkmanire> Can you submit a DELETE or a PUT with XHR?
[00:48:22] <snover> wkmanire: yes.
[00:48:28] <wkmanire> Ah... so thats why that works
[00:48:37] <amagee> hey does anyone have a solution or workaround for this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-sortable-on-tbody-elements-within-a-table
[00:48:39] <wkmanire> Silly me to assume you could do it with a form too.
[00:48:41] <snover> also because web browsers are not the only http clients in the world
[00:48:46] <snover> shocking as that may seem
[00:48:53] <wkmanire> Oh be nice.
[00:49:21] <wkmanire> call it naive innocence.
[00:50:16] <wkmanire> I've only ever done web development with fancy javascript and abusing POST and GET etc... Taking it back to the basics has been a real wakeup call for me.
[00:51:40] <firebalrog> w3fools.com interesting points didn't know it wasn't affliated with w3c
[00:51:58] <vzlahagen> hi
[00:52:29] <wkmanire> firebalrog: They have kick ass search engine rankings so lots of greenhorns get caught up with them.
[00:52:42] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: Howdy
[00:53:00] <firebalrog> not greenhorn just dont spend much time in irc
[00:53:08] <vzlahagen> for some strange reason..i upgraded my site to jquery 1.4.2 ..and suddenly $("form").submit stop working :S
[00:53:11] <wkmanire> firebalrog: Their information is just accurate enough to keep you coming back.
[00:53:17] <vzlahagen> that is..without changing the code...
[00:53:38] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: Which version did you upgrade from?
[00:53:42] <vzlahagen> any ideas would be greatly appreciated
[00:53:43] <snover> vzlahagen: glad to hear you’ve just upgraded to 1.4.2! welcome to december 2009!
[00:53:46] <vzlahagen> 1.3.2
[00:53:59] <firebalrog> try 1.6.1
[00:54:01] <wkmanire> I think some stuff broke between 1.3.2 and new version.
[00:54:03] <wkmanire> versions*
[00:54:21] <vzlahagen> snover: it's drupal not me :S and believe.. it was a -real- pain in the ass to achieve that...
[00:54:43] <firebalrog> which version of drupal?
[00:54:47] <vzlahagen> 6.20
[00:55:32] <wkmanire> Are you getting an exception when you try to trigger submit?
[00:55:36] <vzlahagen> it's working.. i patched includes/common.inc.. even patched jquery_update module...everything else it's working..except that $("form").submit :S
[00:56:01] <vzlahagen> nope.. i even wrote some console.log inside and outside submit block.. everything outside of it works :1
[00:56:05] <wkmanire> Noooo!!!! bot-t!
[00:56:30] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: Is your code literally $('form').submit()?
[00:56:56] <vzlahagen> literally...there is only one form in that document.
[00:57:06] <wkmanire> console.log($('form'))
[00:57:06] <snover> and what is it that you expect that bit of code to do?
[00:57:09] <wkmanire> .length
[00:57:09] <wkmanire> sorry
[00:57:15] <wkmanire> $('form').length
[00:57:22] <wkmanire> Lets make sure the selector at least is still working.
[00:57:58] <vzlahagen> >>> console.log(jQuery("form").length);
[00:58:00] <vzlahagen> 1
[00:58:04] <wkmanire> damn
[00:58:08] <wkmanire> I was hoping for 0.
[00:58:15] <wkmanire> So no submit and no exception.
[00:58:23] <wkmanire> What about $('form')[0].submit()?
[00:58:23] <firebalrog> you need a#
[00:58:32] <wkmanire> firebalrog: Only if he is selecting by ID.
[00:58:39] <firebalrog> yes
[00:58:44] <vzlahagen> i tried that too..same result.
[00:59:03] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: Do you have a live link I can look at?
[00:59:09] <Zerxer> so I have $(":button").live('click',function(e){e.preventDefault();}); so that none of the buttons on the site submit any actual forms, because I'm using ajax for everything. but then if I, later on, do $("#somebutton").click(function(){}) the code doesn't execute because of the live. I thought only stopPropagation would cause that
[00:59:39] <vzlahagen> wkmanire: nope :'(
[00:59:51] <vzlahagen> i could pastebin my code tho..
[00:59:51] <coldhead> bot-t: sup
[00:59:52] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus’ hangin’ ’n’ chillin’
[01:00:07] <wkmanire> bot-t: I thought I saw you log. Do you have split personalities?
[01:00:07] <bot-t> wkmanire, Yes - definitely.
[01:00:13] * wkmanire nods.
[01:00:58] <snover> vzlahagen: you should answer my question
[01:01:30] <wkmanire> coldhead: So I'm excitedly awaiting your js2-coldhead-mode.
[01:01:41] <vzlahagen> snover: sorry .. i was doing that pastebin
[01:02:22] <maxillusionist> hi all
[01:02:24] <vzlahagen> snover: i expect it checks if some input text aren't empty... if they are.. fail submit..otherwise just return true;
[01:02:32] <wkmanire> Zerxer: stopPropogation keeps the event from bubbling I think.
[01:02:40] <coldhead> wkmanire: you should name it after yourself, i'm hoping to have you do most of the work :)
[01:02:42] <snover> with an A.
[01:02:48] <snover> Propogation is not a word.
[01:02:49] <vzlahagen> nothing complicated..i'm not proficient with javascript
[01:03:02] <maxillusionist> can anybody send me some links to download a few ebooks on jquery
[01:03:04] <Zerxer> right, which is why I figured only that would stop this. but I guess preventDefault, from a live bind, will stop a normal bind from activating
[01:03:10] <snover> vzlahagen: I’m not sure how triggering the 'submit' event does anything you just said
[01:03:26] <maxillusionist> please no torrent
[01:03:33] <wkmanire> Zerxer: preventDefault is making the click event never fire and live binds to window (i think) sooo..... I think it is stomping your events.
[01:03:45] <vzlahagen> when user tries to submit.. i check the fields inside the form...
[01:04:03] <wkmanire> coldhead: he he he. Ok ok.
[01:04:05] <Zerxer> hmph I'll just use onclick
[01:04:05] <vzlahagen> some fields anyways..not all of them
[01:04:13] <snover> vzlahagen: I don’t think you know what the word literally means :)
[01:04:14] * wkmanire could't think of any other 2 letter words to repeat.
[01:04:55] * mocas_ morning!
[01:04:59] <wkmanire> snover: Didn't you see me tell firebalrog my spelling sucks?
[01:05:20] <snover> wkmanire: no :)
[01:05:26] <vzlahagen> snover:which word?
[01:05:33] <wkmanire> snover: Oh, thats to bad.
[01:06:36] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: From your description I assumed that the form never submitted at all. is it submitting but something is failing on the server side?
[01:08:05] <vzlahagen> wkmanire: nope.. the form actually submits.. it just doesn't validate my input text fields.....
[01:08:05] <coldhead> wkmanire: https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode
[01:08:13] <coldhead> it seems our labours are nearly over
[01:08:35] * coldhead gets a beer
[01:09:00] <wkmanire> coldhead: I already beat you to the fridge
[01:09:22] <coldhead> THEN YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN THE LAST BEER
[01:09:23] <wkmanire> coldhead: nearly over? If this thing does what the readme says then it does everything I want.
[01:10:40] <wkmanire> I didn't recognize the author's name but he/she seems to be prolific.
[01:11:31] <wkmanire> coldhead: Funny that you say that. I did actually go to my fridge and get a beer, and it was actually the last one. :(
[01:11:40] <vzlahagen> wkmanire,snover: thank you.. i think i've got the problem.. i'm calling to a non-existing function inside $.submit block.. but it happens so fast that it clears my console before i could see it :S
[01:11:42] <coldhead> good job finding her stuff, wkmanire
[01:11:44] <coldhead> you earned that beer
[01:11:52] <coldhead> we can compare notes in a few days
[01:12:25] <wkmanire> coldhead: To be fair, I grabbed it before your announcement.
[01:13:58] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: I was fairly sure that it wasn't $.submit() that broke between those version.
[01:14:01] <wkmanire> versions*
[01:14:16] <wkmanire> broken*
[01:14:55] <_ramo> hi
[01:14:58] <vzlahagen> wkmanire: yes, you are right.. i'm just too noobie with jquery to be sure ...
[01:15:15] <_ramo> what do i have to set into my ajax request, if i want to send data via json to an php file?
[01:15:24] <vzlahagen> wkmanire: anyways.. thank you very much for your time.
[01:15:45] <wkmanire> vzlahagen: I just wish I actually helped ya. he he
[01:16:04] <wkmanire> _ramo: You want to submit JSON data to a PHP script on the server?
[01:16:27] <_ramo> wkmanire: correct
[01:16:52] <_ramo> wkmanire: i've would like to submit data as an json string to the server
[01:16:54] <wkmanire> _ramo: You can use JSON.stringify(myData); and just pass it as a string to the data argument of the .ajax() request.
[01:17:13] <wkmanire> _ramo: But not all browsers have JSON.stringify so be careful with that.
[01:17:28] <_ramo> oh, okay
[01:17:37] <_ramo> so is it better to just send the plain data?
[01:17:56] <Funhouse> what is the best sound plugin to use?
[01:18:14] <wkmanire> _ramo: Well if you have a JSON parser on the PHP side it might be more convenient to send it as JSON.
[01:18:39] <_ramo> wkmanire: but you said, that not all browsers support  json.stringify
[01:18:52] <_ramo> i would like to send from the user to the server
[01:18:53] <wkmanire> _ramo: There are libraries that will do that.
[01:19:14] <wkmanire> I think JSON2 will.
[01:19:46] <_ramo> wkmanire: i don't understand.  i can't influence the clients browser....
[01:20:18] <wkmanire> _ramo: JSON2 is a JSON library written in javascript. You can use that instead of the native JSON.stringify.
[01:21:51] <wkmanire> Funhouse: I haven't played with that much yet to be honest. HTML5 <audio> elements are pretty cool though. I still can't get over the fact that in some browsers MP3 is supported by default.
[01:21:58] <palhmbs> I have a problem that I think jQuery might solve, - I want to swap two <tr> table rows with eachother....
[01:22:12] <Funhouse> wkmanire, hmm ok, was looking to use sounds for effects
[01:22:32] <palhmbs> I'm sick of looking in PHP where it creates it with the correct order - so I figured using jQuery will be easier.
[01:22:59] <wkmanire> palhmbs: Sure, just browse through the DOM manipulation section of the documentation at jQuery.com
[01:23:14] <wkmanire> you can detach and reattach elements to the DOM easily enough
[01:24:20] <palhmbs> thanks wkmanire, I'm setting up a jfiddle now...
[01:27:04] <wkmanire> palhmbs: Have fun
[01:27:04] <_ramo> how can i get the referrer with jquery?
[01:27:30] <_ramo> an aler( jQuery(document.referrer)) just ouputs an object
[01:27:41] <_ramo> i need the url
[01:27:42] <wkmanire> _ramo: I don't think you need jQuery to do that. document.referrer.
[01:28:13] <_ramo> wkmanire: if i do an alert(document.referrer) it just alerts nothing
[01:28:42] <wkmanire> _ramo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.referrer
[01:28:43] <palhmbs> wkmanire, I wonder, should I use .clone() then .remove() then .append() maybe?
[01:28:52] <wkmanire> It will be an empty string if the user just typed in the address intot he address bar
[01:29:02] <palhmbs> I'm in the right place I hope --- http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-inside/
[01:29:05] <wkmanire> palhmbs: use $.detach()
[01:29:15] <_ramo> wkmanire: i do a refresh on a page.. that should return the adress, shouldn't it?
[01:29:29] <timing> Hi guys, how can I just always display the jquery ui datepicker underneath a textbox?
[01:29:30] <wkmanire> _ramo: Nope. refresh is a direct hit to the page.
[01:29:43] <wkmanire> _ramo: navigate to the page using an anchor tag from another page
[01:29:46] <wkmanire> referrer will then have a value.
[01:31:48] <_ramo> wkmanire: hmm... that's now working... i try to retrieve the referrer on document onload
[01:31:52] <wkmanire> timing: Call $.datepicker on a div instead of an input.
[01:32:06] <timing> wkmanire: yeah thanks, I just read it :-).
[01:32:09] <wkmanire> timing: that will display it in inline mode.
[01:32:14] <wkmanire> no prob.
[01:32:16] <timing> wkmanire: however, it doesn't use a textbox then
[01:32:32] <timing> I have to write my own code to connect it with a textbox?
[01:33:02] <wkmanire> timing: Just grab its value and shove it into a hidden input before yoru form submits.
[01:33:05] <wkmanire> yes
[01:33:34] <wkmanire> Well guys, its getting early here and I'm all out of beer so I'm gonna hit the sack.
[01:33:42] <wkmanire> goodnight.
[01:36:09] <timing> wkmanire_: yeah well I want people to edit the value by hand too
[01:37:57] <norbi> hi guys, ițm trying to use jqueryui datepicker, but when it opens over a select i am unable to select date, because it opens the select box
[01:38:01] <norbi> what can i do?
[01:38:15] <norbi> tried from css to set z-index:100000
[01:38:36] <norbi> but still the same, the hover is taked by the select and not by the datepicker
[01:40:44] <RWOverdijk_> Is there any way for me to call code, when jqueryui is done downloading? Because right now my code gets executed before jqueryui is done
[01:40:55] <_ramo> wkmanire_: is it possible to get the komplete url of a page, including the parameters?
[01:41:32] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo,  window.location;
[01:41:44] <vzlahagen> yay! it works!.. i just checked my old code.. i wonder how it was working before :S
[01:42:03] <_ramo> RWOverdijk_: yeah, but i need the parameters from the refererrer
[01:42:14] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo, So split.
[01:42:49] <_ramo> hm? with document.referrer i just the somethin like myserver/file.html but all behind ?id=... .is missing
[01:43:36] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo, what's the full url, and what do you want to get
[01:44:21] <_ramo> http://gvm/portal/multimedia/multimedia-explore.html?ssp[q]=&ssp[fq]=_Format%3A_Multimedia*&ssp[fq]=_Disease%3A_LiverConditions%2F_ChronicLiverDiseaseCirrhosisAndPortalHypertension%2F_BasicAspectsofCirrhosis*#   RWOverdijk_ that's the full url... and i would like to get all parameters of that url too
[01:46:19] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo, but name one specific parameter.
[01:46:41] <_ramo> RWOverdijk_: i would like to have all... e.g. take ssp[fq]
[01:46:45] <_ramo> how do i get it?
[01:47:06] <_ramo> that's the referrer url
[01:47:25] <RWOverdijk_> That one's empty
[01:47:49] <RWOverdijk_> the ssp[q] one
[01:49:15] <_ramo> yeah but no tthe ssp[fq] one
[01:49:17] <silentmars> I've got a form. I want to submit a few things from it via ajax, but then have it submit like a normal form and have it go to the form's action page. is this possible?
[01:50:59] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo, http://jsfiddle.net/6KJby/
[01:52:54] <_ramo> but RWOverdijk_ that's kind of weird... isn't there a jquery function, that fetches the whole URL including all parameters?
[01:53:03] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo, besides this small, simple example, you could also use location.search to get the query string, and split the string on ? & and =
[01:53:42] <_ramo> RWOverdijk_: it doesn't have to be splitted... i just need the whole string, as i posted it above
[01:54:05] <RWOverdijk_> _ramo, This is plain javascript
[01:54:11] <_ramo> RWOverdijk_: yesh, i saw it
[01:54:20] <RWOverdijk_> No I mean, the answer to your question
[01:54:23] <RWOverdijk_> Is pure javascript.
[01:55:04] <RWOverdijk_> You've been given 2 values. The query string, and the base url (location) you're at
[01:55:11] <RWOverdijk_> Use your head and put them together.
[01:55:12] <_ramo> hm, so isn't it possible in javascript to just fetch the whole url include alle it's parameters in one function withouth splitting a fetching each seperate parameter?
[01:55:39] <RWOverdijk_> Good god....
[01:56:21] <_ramo> i guess we're talking on different topics
[01:56:28] <RWOverdijk_> No
[01:56:31] <RWOverdijk_> We're not
[01:56:34] <RWOverdijk_> You want the full url
[01:56:49] <RWOverdijk_> I just gave you two ways to get the query path, and window location
[01:56:56] <RWOverdijk_> And you keep asking for a jquery solution
[01:56:59] <mekwall> http://jsperf.com/data-vs-hasclass/3
[01:57:01] <RWOverdijk_> Use your head
[01:57:01] <mekwall> interesting
[01:57:53] <RWOverdijk_> mekwall, Thanks for sharing.
[01:57:54] <RWOverdijk_> :)
[01:58:15] <mekwall>  hehe np :) the interesting part is that in chrome 13, the native method is slower?!
[01:58:23] <mekwall> not by much, but by a couple of hundred ops
[01:58:48] <zw13b4ck> hello
[01:58:52] <mekwall> which is weird, considering the native method is the same as jQuery's method (but with only one for loop)
[01:59:03] <palhmbs> I've got on real well with wkmanire_'s advice - but it doesn't want to work in wordpress :(
[01:59:09] <palhmbs> http://jsfiddle.net/7nWta/ ^^
[01:59:47] <zw13b4ck> i need help, i get a Server Error 500 via method $.post
[02:00:03] <zw13b4ck> i think the memory is to large
[02:00:26] <RWOverdijk_> mekwall, Absolutely odd. Then again, this is a function, jquery uses nested objects, so perhaps calling one makes a difference
[02:01:07] <zw13b4ck> i check a list via php, is the list small then no error but is the list very long then get this error
[02:01:09] <mekwall> RWOverdijk_: I've tried more or less everything :) I haven't been able to make anything that's faster then jQuerys hasClass in chrome 13
[02:02:03] <zw13b4ck> can anybody help me
[02:02:25] <RWOverdijk_> mekwall, Perhaps chrome simply caches jquery, making it more native than native js :p
[02:02:35] <RWOverdijk_> zw13b4ck, I'm sure someone can
[02:02:59] <RWOverdijk_> zw13b4ck, Just not with the lack of data you're supplying.
[02:03:00] <zw13b4ck> mh
[02:03:11] <RWOverdijk_> "It's not working. ... Error."
[02:03:11] <palhmbs> I've wrapped my functions that work in that jsfiddle in ::> jQuery(document).ready(function(){ -- so I assume it _should_ work in wordpress
[02:03:21] <RWOverdijk_> We cant see your code, or problems, so be more specific.
[02:03:23] <SpecialEmily> is there a way to find all images that have successfully been loaded?
[02:03:33] <palhmbs> but maybe I ought not have in inside the post ?
[02:03:53] <SpecialEmily> like, I have this css: img { background: url('images/ajax-loader.gif') no-repeat 50% 50%; }
[02:04:06] <SpecialEmily> and I want to get rid of the background image after an image is done loading
[02:04:22] <ravenzz> is possible to use regex on selectors?
[02:04:41] <ravenzz> i mean something like $('img[src$="ricerca_migliora.(png|jpg)"]')
[02:04:51] <palhmbs> SpecialEmily, dom content loaded is what your after I think?
[02:05:16] <RWOverdijk_> ravenzz, Check out the selectors page in the docs.
[02:05:28] <SpecialEmily> palhmbs, possibly, I'm not very good with js ._.
[02:06:30] <palhmbs> SpecialEmily, -- http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:06:54] <palhmbs> SpecialEmily, DomContentLoaded is pure javascript - whereas the jQuery method is ^^
[02:07:07] <zw13b4ck> -.-'
[02:07:21] <RWOverdijk_> SpecialEmily, just create a new image, and use the onload event.
[02:07:42] <SpecialEmily> RWOverdijk_, what do you mean?
[02:07:52] <RWOverdijk_> SpecialEmily, I mean what I just said.
[02:08:12] <palhmbs> Who works jQuery magic in wordpress? - I really need to check on some basics here - like can I use jQuery inside wordpress posts?
[02:08:18] <RWOverdijk_> var img = new Image(); img.onload = showImage; img.src = "http://example.net/picture.jpg";
[02:08:30] <RWOverdijk_> or, removeImage in your case.
[02:09:00] <RWOverdijk_> palhmbs, I recommend you read a blog article or something. Your question is too general.
[02:09:08] <ravenzz> RWOverdijk_ there is no regex topic there
[02:09:16] <ravenzz> so should i use find()
[02:09:17] <ravenzz> ?
[02:09:24] <RWOverdijk_> ravenzz, there is.
[02:09:28] <RWOverdijk_> palhmbs, http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/
[02:09:46] <ravenzz> so link me it
[02:09:55] <ravenzz> please
[02:09:58] <RWOverdijk_> just google.
[02:10:15] <zw13b4ck> http://nopaste.info/34b3fdee64.html <— this is the php class, this class returns me the filtering log, when $this->file a smaller list, i get no error BUT is this list a larger list then return me firebug an Internal Server Error (500)
[02:10:24] <RWOverdijk_> You know ^= and $= should make sense to you
[02:10:28] <RWOverdijk_> otherwise *=
[02:10:42] <palhmbs> thanks RWOverdijk_ - much appreciated - bd
[02:10:49] <SpecialEmily> $= makes no sense to me
[02:10:53] <RWOverdijk_> ^= means starts with, $= means ends with, *= means contains.
[02:11:01] <RWOverdijk_> that was for ravenzz
[02:11:12] <ravenzz> Actually jQuery supports a subset of of regular expression-like filters.
[02:11:14] <ravenzz> yes ok
[02:11:25] <ravenzz> a subset
[02:11:26] <RWOverdijk_> ffs
[02:11:37] <RWOverdijk_> SpecialEmily, var img = new Image(); img.onload = showImage; img.src = "http://example.net/picture.jpg"; /*  this one was for you */
[02:11:43] <ravenzz> i suppose that \w\s is not one of those
[02:13:42] <RWOverdijk_> anyway I'm off to work
[02:14:24] <ravenzz> have a good time, thank you anyway
[02:14:33] <zw13b4ck> …
[02:15:52] <silentmars> ah, I think I figured it out... needed to turn off async for the ajax request
[02:16:26] <zw13b4ck> did you mean meß
[02:16:34] <zw13b4ck> ß = ?
[02:16:43] <RWOverdijk_> zw13b4ck, You shouldnt be in here.
[02:16:49] <RWOverdijk_> Your problem is server side.
[02:17:03] <RWOverdijk_> 500 = apache. Triggered by (I think) php.
[02:17:10] <RWOverdijk_> Nothing to do with jquery.
[02:17:25] <zw13b4ck> i think this problem is a js problem
[02:17:55] <zw13b4ck> when i call this class via php without js/jquery ==> no server error
[02:18:08] <RWOverdijk_> 500 is server side.
[02:18:17] <zw13b4ck> yes i know
[02:18:31] <silentmars> zw13b4ck: did you check your apache error log?
[02:18:32] <RWOverdijk_> so it's nothing to do with jquery.
[02:18:44] <RWOverdijk_> silentmars, This is #jquery, let's not enable him.
[02:18:53] <zw13b4ck> lol
[02:19:10] <zw13b4ck> no i cant check my apache error log
[02:19:28] <zw13b4ck> i have a basic webhosting server
[02:21:28] <silentmars> RWOverdijk_: while I find the tendancy in open source discussion areas to search for reasons to dismiss a person's question interesting from a sociological perspective, for me it is not a particularly fulfilling pursuit to engage in personally.
[02:22:40] <silentmars> zw13b4ck: well those logs will tell you what's going on with that error
[02:23:24] <RWOverdijk_> silentmars, And I think you should simply follow the rules. Stay ontopic.
[02:23:42] <zw13b4ck> yes sadly i know this
[02:29:24] <RWOverdijk_> silentmars, $('.selectorToYourForm').submit();
[02:29:27] <RWOverdijk_> happy?
[02:31:33] <zeen> i'm getting stupidly confused with selecting the first a from a ul/li link and not going any deeper into child ul's a links
[02:31:46] <zeen> $('#navigation ul li >a') is selected all a links
[02:32:03] <zeen> but i just want to select the first a dom child of each li
[02:32:03] <RWOverdijk_> :first
[02:32:06] <zeen> ah
[02:32:28] <RWOverdijk_> :first-child, even (on li)
[02:32:53] <RWOverdijk_> :first returns the first element matched (from the array) and :first-child the first child of the element found.
[02:33:35] <zeen> $('#navigation ul li:first-child a');
[02:33:57] <zeen> only selects the first li.. i want it to select all li's and not go any deeper than inside those li's
[02:34:06] <RWOverdijk_> That would return the first child's (being an anchor) anchor child.
[02:34:26] <Zerxer> naw since he attached it to the li, but as he said it's not what he wants anyways
[02:34:47] <zeen> ya, i want to do all li's, but not <li><a href="link">abc</a><ul><li><a href="">not this</a></li></ul> .. <li>...</ul>
[02:34:52] <RWOverdijk_> yeah, and the li's first child is an anchor
[02:35:03] <Zerxer> so why didn't > a work
[02:35:06] <Zerxer> oh wait
[02:35:09] <RWOverdijk_> :/
[02:35:19] <Zerxer> $("#navigation ul > li > a")
[02:35:24] <zeen> hmm
[02:35:31] <zeen> nope
[02:35:44] <Zerxer> lol add another > in there
[02:35:47] <Zerxer> #navigation > ul
[02:36:12] <zeen> returns nothing now
[02:36:13] <Zerxer> I'm pretty sure ul:first should work, too
[02:36:35] <Zerxer> what is your exact structure here
[02:36:44] <zeen> it can't because there is only one ul anyway in
[02:36:47] <zeen> #navigation
[02:36:52] <zeen> let me put it on jsfiddle
[02:39:02] <zeen> http://jsfiddle.net/WcQTr/
[02:39:10] <zeen> so i want to select the yes a tags
[02:39:22] <Zerxer> and RWOverdijk_, when the selector is attached to the element like that, it's saying the element is part of the selector. so "ul li:first-child" would grab all the first children of ul that are of type 'li', and not the first-child of li which is the anchor
[02:39:33] <zeen> i know this is going to be dead simple, just selectors i forget all the time
[02:39:56] <RWOverdijk_> Zerxer, Right, I misread there. Sorry.\
[02:40:55] <Zerxer> zeen, in that particular case: $("ul:first > li")
[02:41:06] <_ramo> is it possible to retrieve the current logged in user on a typo3 system with jquery?
[02:41:06] <Zerxer> since the ul doesn't have an ID and there's no parent to reference off of
[02:41:10] <zeen> i want the a..
[02:41:14] <zeen> not the li :)
[02:41:19] <Zerxer> well li > a too
[02:41:30] <Zerxer> but it won't traverse into the lower uls
[02:41:39] <Zerxer> $("ul:first > li > a")
[02:41:59] <ServerSage> zeen: or just give them classes and select on class.
[02:42:08] <Zerxer> that always makes things simpler
[02:42:27] <zeen> ServerSage, i don't want to give them classes
[02:42:28] <Zerxer> but when is simple fun :(
[02:42:56] <zeen> yeah this :first still makes no difference
[02:43:13] <Zerxer> works fine on that jsfiddle
[02:43:14] <ServerSage> zeen: Then you have to use Zerxer's suggestion and look at the html() to see if it's yes or no.
[02:43:41] <Zerxer> http://jsfiddle.net/WcQTr/1/   it's only counting the outermost li a's
[02:44:06] <Zerxer> something else in the rest of your structure is messing it up then, unless I'm missing something else that you're trying to do
[02:45:19] <Zerxer> zeen: I'm assuming you're trying to tweak it now to also include your container's ID?
[02:45:31] <zeen> hmm you are right, it is working on jsfiddle
[02:45:56] <zeen> oh my god
[02:45:57] <zeen> ok
[02:45:59] <zeen> please ignore me
[02:46:10] * zeen turns off curfon first
[02:46:21] <Zerxer> what was it
[02:46:25] <zeen> that's why i was getting so confused :P
[02:46:39] <zeen> cufon sorry, it changes text to open fonts
[02:48:59] <zeen> sorry guys and thanks. i was being an idiot
[02:52:23] <_foobar> can anyone point me in a direction where I can read about MVC and jQuery. an article u might like.. I can ofc google myself, no need to help me with that ;)
[02:54:02] <Deele> _foobar, have you tried jQ plugin section tag MVC?
[02:55:19] <zeen> also sounds a bit spammy but if you have any feedback about my site please let me know.. http://www.thecodebakery.com/
[02:55:35] <zeen> trying to get the filters and content right and tidying up some loose ends
[02:55:56] <_foobar> Deele: Now I have, cant seam to find anyting useful
[02:56:12] <_foobar> zeen: hou are u talking to.. averyone?
[02:56:37] <zeen> ya anyone, i was going to search for jquery and mvc in my search but i need to improve it first :P
[02:56:49] <Zerxer> zeen: no ajax jquery tabs? or infinite scroll? :(
[02:57:04] <zeen> i know i got a bunch of articles regarding jquery and mvc, just gotta improve it
[02:57:17] <zeen> ya i might ajax things up
[02:57:32] <Deele> zeen, your site has some <?php tags in HTML
[02:57:34] <Zerxer> ?g infinite scroll
[02:57:35] <bot-t> Zerxer, Infinite Scroll | jQuery plugin, Wordpress plugin, interaction ... - http://infinite-scroll.com/
[02:57:50] <zeen> ya, that's gotta be fixed too. for some reason cakephp caching is crap
[02:58:27] <t432> on line 17, i am trying to retrive the results and display it within the div tag (show) line 29, what i'm i doin wrong? http://pastebin.com/G4nq4akU
[02:58:34] <t432> guessin line 17 ie wrong
[02:58:52] <zeen> infinate scroll shouldn't be a problem, i just need to append page:x, load ajax then append to dom element
[02:59:09] <Deele> t432 why you are doing so?
[02:59:10] <Zerxer> t432: .html(something) not .innerHTML = something
[02:59:15] <_foobar> zeen: good site els.. Bookmarking ;)
[02:59:34] <zeen> thanks :)
[02:59:40] <zeen> i hope it'll get better
[02:59:54] <Zerxer> though t432: give your showResponse function an argument like r, so function showResponse(r){ $("#show").html(r.responseText); }
[03:00:39] <zeen> it's a pet project, taken since nov last year to get where it is now. been a lot of optimisation and code changes behind the scenes
[03:01:04] <zeen> auto downloading, categorising and scoring wasn't straight forward :P
[03:01:06] <t432> Zerxer: the argument? when in line 11 where the showresponse function is called, dosnt have an argument?
[03:01:50] <Zerxer> t432: when you provide a function name to be called like that, it also gets any arguments that the calling function sends. which, the success function sends along a couple of arguments, the first of which being a response object
[03:02:05] <t432> i c
[03:02:10] <Zerxer> t432: you could also just do success: function(r){$("#show").html(r.responseText);}   instead of having a separate function
[03:02:30] <Zerxer> on line 11
[03:03:33] <Zerxer> t432: I believe you may be using 'context' inappropriately, too
[03:03:50] <Zerxer> looks more like you want data: 'name=' + $("#name").val()
[03:04:23] <Zerxer> you don't need that 'new' there either on line 7
[03:04:45] <t432> was wondering why it wasnt working.. so its data instead of context?
[03:04:58] <Zerxer> yup, and you need to do .val() on $("#name") to get the value
[03:05:30] <Zerxer> t432: another thing you can do is data: $("#test").serialize()   <-your form's ID is 'test', so this grabs all input values in it and creates the name=value string for you
[03:05:44] <Zerxer> in case you add more inputs later
[03:05:47] <Zerxer> makes it easier
[03:06:13] <t432> ok this is what i have ... http://pastebin.com/CSpDNQ51
[03:06:38] <t432> result not seem to be showing up
[03:06:40] <Zerxer> you need a comma after the .val() still, otherwise it'll error when it runs into 'success' after
[03:06:52] <t432> tried that
[03:07:05] <Zerxer> oh another thing
[03:07:17] <Zerxer> url: 'myform.php', should be inside your { } object
[03:07:23] <Zerxer> and don't pass it as the first argument like that
[03:07:32] <Zerxer> .ajax() would just take the { } of options
[03:09:05] <Zerxer> ?ajax
[03:09:05] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

[03:10:49] <t432> still now showing up
[03:11:00] <t432> not*
[03:11:10] <Zerxer> hm you got rid of the $.ajax( ) wrapper
[03:11:24] <Zerxer> I meant just get rid of having the url as the first argument
[03:11:43] <Zerxer> $.ajax() only takes the settings object

[03:18:16] <t432> 1 sec
[03:18:17] <Zerxer> } ? or {
[03:18:22] <t432> {
[03:18:27] <t432> i meant ^^
[03:19:04] <t432> http://pastebin.com/fZZkETF9
[03:19:56] <Zerxer> do you have a link to the website this code is on, though? as far as I can see it should work fine
[03:20:18] <t432> its on localhost
[03:20:26] <t432> nvm
[03:20:33] <t432> i'll figure it out
[03:20:40] <Zerxer> you're using a debugger now then?
[03:20:48] <Zerxer> check out the request in the console, make sure it actually returns something
[03:21:30] <r3v3rb> i have a sliding menu system here : m-spacehosting.com/~e14s3m11
[03:21:36] <r3v3rb> why does this code : http://pastebin.com/MeKhG8nA
[03:21:46] <r3v3rb> make it bounce around?
[03:24:10] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: you mean when you hover one, hover out, then hover back on it, how it bounces shut and open?
[03:24:20] <r3v3rb> yes
[03:24:22] <Zerxer> you're not checking if what they hovered is already opened
[03:24:25] <hendrikadriaanbo> what does $(this.toString()) do ?
[03:24:55] <r3v3rb> okay Zerxer, any idea where i might add that ?
[03:25:07] <r3v3rb> and an example?
[03:25:16] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: define a variable outside of that function and store showMenu in it, so you have an identifier for it, and when mouseenter starts, check if showMenu == that other variable
[03:25:26] <Zerxer> if it does, return; out of the function
[03:25:41] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: actually
[03:25:43] <t432> live http header output.. http://pastebin.com/7hBp0g4C
[03:25:44] <Zerxer> don't need that variable
[03:26:24] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: after you set showMenu, check if that li hasClass(show[0]+'current')
[03:26:32] <Zerxer> if it does, then return;
[03:27:13] <r3v3rb> i think i get you :)
[03:27:14] <Zerxer> t432: what's the response text though? those are the response headers
[03:27:32] <Zerxer> if it's not outputting any text then there's nothing for the page to show
[03:28:00] <t432> good question
[03:28:52] <t432> firebug seems to show the response text
[03:29:06] <t432> in the respinse tab
[03:29:12] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, but i have three different classes not a single one to check for - will that make a difference?
[03:29:49] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: you're only adding one class to it though, using show[0]. so do that same thing when checking
[03:29:59] <r3v3rb> okay
[03:30:34] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: I'm not sure you have to get the parent of e.target, either
[03:30:49] <Zerxer> since you're binding the .mouseenter directly to the li, and the li is what you want anyways, 'this' will reference it
[03:30:57] <Zerxer> so basically this == clickParent already
[03:31:12] <Zerxer> $(this), rather, since your clickParent was a jquery object
[03:32:27] <r3v3rb> true
[03:32:37] <r3v3rb> this code has kind of evolved ;)
[03:32:38] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: this seems like what you want, if I'm not mistaken http://pastebin.com/WQabxZ62
[03:35:25] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, its better in that it doesn't bounce around , but now once opened you can never close - by hovering on contact or about... :D
[03:35:53] * r3v3rb needs to add some code to the if statement methinks :D
[03:36:20] <Zerxer> really? would the other ones actually have the 'current' class though?
[03:37:04] <ndee> hi there, I have a page with ratings and each rating has a button "helpful" or "not helpful". Now, for triggering the action, what's the best practice? I know I shouldn't add a onclick="...". So I added a handler in the dom ready $('.class').click(function()) but how can I pass a value to that function? I added multiple classes to the button, is this the best practice?
[03:37:17] <r3v3rb> no but for a clean interface I was hoping to have them close the open menu's when hovered on
[03:37:36] <r3v3rb> i'll use their class 'nm' to close any open menus
[03:37:55] <Zerxer> ndee: what I do now is make use of HTML5's data attributes, as jquery can access them with .data()
[03:38:23] <ndee> Zerxer, that also works in a browser without html5 functionality, right?
[03:38:31] <Zerxer> if you're using HTML5, at least. use data-value_name="whatever" and then you can do .data('valueName')
[03:38:47] <Zerxer> should work in any browser, but I believe you have to at least be using the html5 doctype
[03:39:02] <ndee> Zerxer, I see. is there an alternative to that?
[03:39:16] <Anomareh> http://jsfiddle.net/4g6az/1/ does anyone know how I can fix this so that when the header is triple clicked fast the overlay is faded out properly?
[03:39:39] <ndee> Zerxer, I mean, I added a class with each argument being separated by a space but... don't know if that is best practice.
[03:40:34] <Zerxer> ndee: well, you technically could just create your own attributes named whatever you want, and then pull them with .attr(). it's not valid HTML, but it won't cause any browser parsing errors
[03:40:42] <Zerxer> how many arguments are you needing to send for each click?
[03:40:43] <mullet_> Hey all. I'm having problems with .animate(), .fadeTo() and .fadeIn(). All 3 are affecting the css 'left' of the item I'm changing the opacity of. Anyone got any thoughts?
[03:40:50] <ndee> Zerxer, two.
[03:41:39] <Zerxer> I don't really know if I'd use classes. in case you ever need to add an actual CSS class to it, and classes should be reserved for styling and easily selecting things
[03:42:06] <Zerxer> I'm guessing you're not using html5/
[03:42:07] <Zerxer> ?*
[03:42:27] <ndee> Zerxer, not yet ;) but I think I can. But I was wondering, there has to be some best practice for that.
[03:42:52] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, well it works once :P then stops closing the menus after the first instance...
[03:43:07] <r3v3rb> time to fire up firefox
[03:43:12] <r3v3rb> and stop using safari
[03:43:28] <ndee> Zerxer, I could use input fields
[03:43:46] <Zerxer> ndee: I always relied on other attributes. I have no idea if it's best practice, but that's what I did. made attributes named after the actual property names that the values were related to
[03:43:51] <Zerxer> now I'm all about data
[03:44:05] <ndee> Zerxer, ok :)
[03:44:10] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: is the original link you gave me updated?
[03:44:15] <Zerxer> I'm guessing not
[03:44:42] <r3v3rb> all fixed
[03:44:48] <r3v3rb> should be
[03:45:22] <Zerxer> so it's fixed then? working good?
[03:45:33] <r3v3rb> i added a little test after your original to test against the class 'nm' and close anything that might be open...
[03:45:37] <r3v3rb> works great now
[03:45:44] <r3v3rb> now to test on ios too
[03:45:47] <r3v3rb> ughh
[03:45:48] <r3v3rb> :D
[03:54:51] <meric> so I've set a $(elt).click(fn). how do I undo that?
[03:55:32] <meric> $('li').unbind('click'). ?
[03:55:36] <timing> with the slide event of the range slider, how do I know which of the two handles is moved?
[04:00:26] <jackp10> hi to everyone...
[04:00:29] <Zerxer> meric, yes
[04:00:42] <meric> thanks.
[04:01:17] <jackp10> i am trying to implement a dataTables plugin, and it works well.. the only problem i am facing is that when i change page, the test alert does not work anymore, and i am not sure why
[04:01:33] <jackp10> you can view an example here: 195.217.35.161/test/test.php
[04:01:46] <jackp10> there is a column with a "test" link....
[04:02:17] <jackp10> it works ok when the page load, but if i click to thee next page, then i dont get the alert, nor a javascript error
[04:02:20] <meric> did you make the plugin yourself
[04:02:31] <jackp10> meric: no
[04:02:43] <meric> you might need to apply click events again each time you load a new page
[04:03:09] <Zerxer> jackp10: are you binding on page load with .click() or something
[04:03:17] <Zerxer> I see, you are
[04:03:17] <meric> i.e the elements not on the first place did not exist yet when you applied the click(function() alert("test")) code?
[04:03:26] <Zerxer> jackp10: use .live('click', function(){}) instead
[04:03:28] <Zerxer> ?live
[04:03:28] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:03:39] <meric> wow cool I didn't know that
[04:04:25] <t432> prototype.js lib seems to work, http://pastebin.com/qtz4REnL whereas jquery does not (results dont show up) http://pastebin.com/pS8nrn0G
[04:04:28] <t432> styrange!
[04:04:37] <t432> strange*
[04:05:27] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, any clue on ipad detection... i have this so far http://pastebin.com/qgZbyxV7
[04:05:35] <r3v3rb> but its still responds to clicks
[04:05:44] <r3v3rb> and goes to the page
[04:05:45] <jackp10> Zerxer: the .live works...
[04:05:49] <jackp10> thank you for the help
[04:06:16] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: I feel like .match returns false if nothing matched, not null
[04:07:14] <r3v3rb> 	var isiPad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) != null;
[04:07:18] <r3v3rb> becomes
[04:07:29] <r3v3rb> 	var isiPad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) = false;
[04:07:50] <r3v3rb> then i get my boolean of course !
[04:07:54] <Zerxer> nope, first, = is a setter, you'd want ==
[04:08:03] <Zerxer> but I believe that's backwards of what you want
[04:08:04] <r3v3rb> sure
[04:08:12] <Zerxer> you're saying if iPad isn't in the userAgent, then it's not an iPad
[04:08:17] <Zerxer> so you'd still want !=
[04:09:20] <r3v3rb> ok, i'll give it a go
[04:09:52] <r3v3rb> nice
[04:10:28] <r3v3rb> however now mouseenter isn't working on non ipad code
[04:10:31] <r3v3rb> arggghhhh
[04:11:03] <Zerxer> that's interesting, check what navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) is returning
[04:11:08] <Zerxer> on non ipad
[04:11:12] <Zerxer> console.log( ) it
[04:11:31] <r3v3rb> sure
[04:12:52] <t432> you only the link to the jquery-1.6.1.js only right?
[04:12:53] <r3v3rb> returns true
[04:13:01] <t432> need*
[04:13:14] <Zerxer> returns true? it should return more than that. it should return exactly what it matched
[04:13:35] <Zerxer> console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i))
[04:13:48] <Zerxer> or just run that line in your browser's console
[04:13:54] <r3v3rb> nah i did console.log(isiPad) :)
[04:14:01] <Zerxer> oh no
[04:14:04] <r3v3rb> lol
[04:14:06] <Zerxer> we already know that's returning true
[04:14:09] <Zerxer> but now we want to know why
[04:14:14] <Zerxer> why is it matching iPad in the user agent string
[04:14:25] <Zerxer> what browser you on
[04:14:56] <Zerxer> actually
[04:15:11] <Zerxer> I just tested it myself now, I guess match does return null. that's interesting, I swore I always treated it like it returned false
[04:15:12] <r3v3rb> safari osx 10.6
[04:15:17] <ablomen> it's not, he uses !=
[04:15:21] <Zerxer> so that would probably explain why both return to true
[04:15:23] <Zerxer> :(
[04:16:00] <ablomen> it should be: var isIpad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)
[04:16:24] <Zerxer> ablomen: he's using != false, which means == true, which means it does match. but that was probably my fault for saying it would return true
[04:16:27] <r3v3rb> ablomen then i can use true false
[04:16:35] <Zerxer> I mean
[04:16:40] <Zerxer> for saying that it would return false, instead of null
[04:16:46] <hendrikadriaanbo> I would like to data scrape meta-description and meta-keywords anyone has some code for this ?
[04:16:50] <Zerxer> it's 6 am and I want to go to bed :(
[04:17:08] <ablomen> var isIpad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ? true : false; will give you true or false
[04:17:21] <Zerxer> best suggestion
[04:17:21] <ablomen> otherwise it gives you thruthy and falsy values
[04:17:57] <r3v3rb> okay ablomen, i'll add ?true : false
[04:18:07] <r3v3rb> it works without though, but to be fail safe
[04:18:17] <r3v3rb> now to add an android test too
[04:18:19] <r3v3rb> :)
[04:18:22] <Zerxer> :) yay android
[04:18:30] <Zerxer> my phone and tablet thank your awareness
[04:18:38] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, go download my game then
[04:18:40] <r3v3rb> :D
[04:18:41] <Zerxer> lol
[04:18:48] <r3v3rb> HoneyRun HD Free in the market
[04:18:54] <Zerxer> I want to get into app development now, but probably going to use something like appcelerator
[04:19:17] * r3v3rb mentions its also available for other brands of phone with an i in the title...
[04:19:28] <Zerxer> phones which should not be named
[04:19:40] <r3v3rb> mines called charlie
[04:19:57] <r3v3rb> and he does pretty much everything i ask him to now
[04:20:15] <r3v3rb> now that he got an OTA gingerbread update at the weekend
[04:21:35] <Zerxer> what phone?
[04:21:41] <r3v3rb> anyone know the test for android?
[04:21:45] <Zerxer> you mean yo udidn't root it and just get an updated rom yourself? :(
[04:21:46] <r3v3rb> HTC Desire HD
[04:22:04] <r3v3rb> did all that with my HTC Magic, cant be bothered on Desire
[04:22:07] <Zerxer> android phones have android mobile in the user agent, android tablets (and other androidy things?) have android in the user agent
[04:22:12] <Zerxer> I believe
[04:22:21] <ablomen> Zerxer, what tablet do you have, and what android version are you running on it?
[04:22:23] <r3v3rb> so test for android will be sufficient
[04:23:22] <r3v3rb> for example this should work?
[04:23:23] <r3v3rb> 	var isiPad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i);
[04:23:23] <r3v3rb> 	var isAndroid = navigator.userAgent.match(/android/i);
[04:23:23] <r3v3rb> 	
[04:23:23] <r3v3rb> 	if(!isiPad || !isAndroid){
[04:23:44] <Zerxer> I would assume so
[04:24:12] <r3v3rb> ;) testing now
[04:24:42] <r3v3rb> tried cm7 on my tablet yesterday, unfortunately it drops the wifi almost constantly
[04:24:50] <Zerxer> what tablet
[04:24:58] <Zerxer> I didn't know they were making cm7 for tablets now
[04:25:02] <r3v3rb> vega
[04:25:05] <Zerxer> I looked when I first got mine and they were saying they wouldn't
[04:25:11] <Zerxer> I got the xoom
[04:25:15] <r3v3rb> nice
[04:25:26] <r3v3rb> they will, they cant help themselves
[04:25:41] <Zerxer> I'm sad that google decided to block rooted devices from having movies
[04:25:48] <Zerxer> but I didn't really plan on renting movies from them
[04:25:52] <Zerxer> other than maybe 1 just to see what it's lik
[04:25:53] <Zerxer> e
[04:26:00] <r3v3rb> lol, there are easoer ways ;)
[04:26:07] <r3v3rb> easier even
[04:26:46] <Zerxer> yeah
[04:26:51] <Zerxer> it's pretty stupid though
[04:27:13] <knapper_tech> i'm building a little box to plug into pages that fetches divs with ajax and then needs to call custom animations in a generic way while allowing for those animations to stop
[04:27:37] <knapper_tech> i have a way to do it if i can make an array of objects that consists of function pointers and animation times
[04:28:38] <L4suicide> will a while loop wait for a timeout function?
[04:28:47] <knapper_tech> no
[04:28:54] <knapper_tech> timeout lets execution continue
[04:28:55] <L4suicide> eg. while (x>0) { window.setTimeout(myfunc,1000); }
[04:29:27] <knapper_tech> might just clobber the same setTimeout handler over an dover
[04:29:43] <knapper_tech> or set tons of timeouts
[04:30:01] <knapper_tech> i think you're looking for setInterval
[04:30:03] <L4suicide> is there an alternative?
[04:30:13] <L4suicide> my ajax requests are all mis-firing
[04:30:23] <knapper_tech> yeah, i've had that
[04:30:38] <L4suicide> like arnold they are all coming too early :P
[04:30:39] <knapper_tech> you have to put things that you want to get called after the timeout/interval into the callback function
[04:30:48] <knapper_tech> arnold...
[04:31:22] <knapper_tech> i guess too bad he didn't terminate it
[04:31:57] <L4suicide> hehe, my whole 9 hour shfit was arnold jokes
[04:32:15] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, adding that android || into the if fubars the script and its started bouncing again :(
[04:32:49] <Zerxer> r3v3rb: oh, you'd want to make sure it's not ipad and not android
[04:32:52] <Zerxer> so && not ||
[04:34:34] <r3v3rb> gotcha
[04:36:07] <r3v3rb> perfecto !
[04:36:21] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, you may go to sleep now ;)
[04:36:35] <Zerxer> oh good
[04:36:36] <Zerxer> 6:30am
[04:37:00] <r3v3rb> works across all browsers correctly now :D
[04:37:39] <Zerxer> what about IE :D
[04:37:43] <Zerxer> or.. netscape :D
[04:48:39] <Anomareh> http://jsfiddle.net/4g6az/1/ does anyone know how I can fix this so that when the header is triple clicked fast the overlay is faded out properly?
[04:52:17] <r3v3rb> Zerxer, ie is actually fine :D
[04:52:43] <coldhead> is everybody good and well?
[04:53:44] <xec> i'm super! thanks for asking!
[05:13:01] <liminal> hello
[05:13:02] <matias> Hello
[05:13:08] <matias> How're you all?
[05:15:10] <liminal> has anyone experience of using the lightbox plugin with wordpress
[05:15:17] <liminal> using jquery?
[05:18:01] <t432> This has got me stumped... http://pastebin.com/bxVh9sby
[05:18:10] <t432> cant seem to get the results to appear
[05:18:45] <espressive> Hi there everyone
[05:18:55] <Anitox> try: $('#show').html(r);
[05:19:26] <espressive> Did anyone read the following article regarding the problem with U+2028 and U+2029 and JSONP? http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset
[05:19:44] <t432> ahh
[05:19:46] <t432> worked!
[05:19:48] <t432> thx
[05:19:50] <Anitox> huzzah!
[05:19:51] <Anitox> np
[05:20:08] <espressive> Not sure whether can be an issue in JavaScript as well, the article suggest that it is.
[05:20:14] <matias> I have to create an ajax request every X seconds and the difference between them is just one parameter I want to send, what would be a good idea to do so?
[05:20:21] <espressive> Does jQuery already escape these?
[05:20:43] <matias> I thought I can have an object with the basic configuration but then how should I change the data?
[05:23:33] <matias> maybe I will do function() {config.data.parameter = whatever(); $.ajax(send);}
[05:23:52] <matias> I meant, $.ajax(config);
[05:29:14] <_ramo> how could i implement a clickable map over an video with jquery?
[05:32:20] <xec> _ramo: if the video is flash or some other browser plugin it might override any javascript, but you can probably get started with something like http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[05:34:19] <_ramo> xec: but if i use a overlay on a play button, would that playbutton start, if i click on the overlay? i guess no
[05:34:19] <_ramo> :)
[05:35:45] <xec> _ramo: tbh i havent tried, but an overlay could do the trick
[05:36:30] <xec> oh, and the mousemove is overkill, just a nice way to demonstrate how you get the mouse position
[05:36:48] <_ramo> yep
[05:36:56] <_ramo> thank you xec
[05:45:26] <ravenzz> mh
[05:46:00] <ravenzz> any idea why .attr('selected','selected') is not being executed?
[05:46:00] <ravenzz> http://pastie.org/1960973
[05:47:13] <espressive> ravenzz, try using .prop('selected', true);
[05:48:48] <ravenzz> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'prop'
[05:49:02] <espressive> Which version of jQuery is this running against?
[05:49:07] <ravenzz> 1.4.2
[05:49:41] <ravenzz> crappy work from someone else ...because on my test fiddle it work http://jsfiddle.net/7SpfJ/4/
[05:49:51] <t432> as it stand when the img.php form is submitted to myform.php, it it reads the value from $_POST['name#'] and displays it at the bottom of the img.php form.

[05:51:01] <ravenzz> espressive i can give you a live link whether you would help me
[05:51:15] <espressive> shoot
[05:53:07] <SpecialEmily> how can I make this cleaner? like into a jquery prototype or something like that? ._. http://pastie.org/1960991
[05:53:27] <t432> guess I need something like this $arr=new Array(); $arr=array)$_POST['name'] in the myform.php but if I do this then $arr reverts to null ($arr=new Array();) after multiple submissions
[05:53:51] <SpecialEmily> like, I want to be able to supply the ID and the URL and perhaps the polling interval etc from a parameter, but I suck at js
[05:59:52] <Aamir> ravenzz:  use select.val(value)
[06:00:25] <ravenzz> instead of
[06:00:32] <ravenzz> selected?
[06:00:37] <Aamir> yes
[06:00:49] <seutje> omagawd http://carmageddon.com/
[06:00:53] <ravenzz> mh i'll give it a try
[06:00:54] <seutje> oops, wrong chan
[06:01:16] <ravenzz> i should have a value property on the <select> ?
[06:01:54] <djQuery> ravenzz: no it is smart enough to detect that it is a select and get the right thing on it
[06:03:16] <ravenzz> so after an select.val(value) i cant see anything as i can understand which element is selected
[06:03:17] <ravenzz> ?
[06:03:30] <MoTiOnXml> the magic var is $texas

[06:04:51] <ravenzz> great
[06:04:54] <ravenzz> thank you
[06:04:58] <Aamir> np :)
[06:06:16] <djQuery> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/7SpfJ/6/
[06:08:27] <ravenzz> yes djQuery i see, basically i have that issue due to a bad implementation of that custom select
[06:08:38] <ravenzz> thank you too
[06:09:28] <Aamir> or console.debug($('select'), $('select option:selected'));
[06:11:21] <Whirl3d> $(collection).data("someting","someval")  --- do all the items in the collection get the data object added to them or does the data belong to the group only?
[06:12:31] <djQuery> Whirl3d: every item in the selection will recieve the data
[06:12:46] <Aamir> Whirl3d:  good question, i think it will be applied to all but check
[06:13:29] <Whirl3d> djQuery, Aamir, thanks for the reply
[06:13:43] <Zothos> Hi there
[06:13:50] <Derppy> Does anyone happen to know any good examples of jquery being utilized for complex forms? I'm building a feature comparison tool where users submit the products features. There's many lists inside each other, each filled with checkboxes, radio buttons and other inputs. They need to disable and enable each other.
[06:13:52] <Aamir> Zothos:  ohai
[06:14:20] <Zothos> i do have a fully css bassed dropdown menu. Its working based on the css :hoover attribute. is there a way to get a delay on top of that?
[06:14:37] <Zothos> :D
[06:15:04] <Aamir> Zothos:  not sure you can do that just with css but u can in css3
[06:15:12] <Aamir> ?g css3 hover delay

[06:15:42] <Zothos> hm, isnt there a cross browser non css3 way available with jquery? i thought so, hm
[06:16:24] <azatoth_work> I've issues with the form wizard plugin, in trying to update it, I can't any more utilize external back/next buttons
[06:16:35] <ravenzz> just move you css for hovered items into a new class
[06:16:44] <ravenzz> and then switch it with .hover()
[06:16:44] <ravenzz> ?
[06:21:00] <sublimenal> Hi there I'm having trouble here, I'm trying to mimic thickbox in a way with jqueryui. But when you click the link it loads the popup it actually redirects the page.

[06:32:52] <sublimenal> Hey thanks allot yogurt, worked perfectly
[06:34:34] <bittyx-laptop> when using .sortable(), is there a way to make it, so that when you drag an item around, the other items change their positions smoothly (making place to drop the dragged item), instead of skipping instantly?
[06:35:56] <no5thdimension> if you have link somewhere within a div with class="bla", how do you select all inputs within the div?
[06:36:35] <no5thdimension> ie. click on the link, and it changes the attributes of all inputs within the nearest div with a class="bla"
[06:36:43] <Raverix> $('.bla input')
[06:36:58] <Raverix> 'nearest'
[06:37:06] <Raverix> IE closest ancestor?
[06:37:52] <L4suicide> im still struggling with my logic flow. I need to perform the same function many times, but each time must be a good 2-3 seconds after the last, and I need to be able to stop the action after x calls, or if one of two external factors meet certain criteria.
[06:37:54] <no5thdimension> $('.unlock').bind('click', function(){
[06:37:54] <no5thdimension> 		$(this).closest('.bla input').removeAttr('disabled');
[06:37:54] <no5thdimension> 	});
[06:38:06] <no5thdimension> doesnt work
[06:38:25] <Raverix> $(yourlink).parent('.bla').find('input')
[06:39:03] <Raverix> $(yourlink).parentsUntil('.bla').find('input')
[06:39:14] <Raverix> No.
[06:39:16] <Raverix> Hmmm
[06:39:48] <Raverix> $(yourlink).parents('.bla').find('input')
[06:39:51] <Raverix> Try it.
[06:39:54] <no5thdimension> ill try isolating the problem. im using tables, which might be messing with the jquery
[06:39:55] <Raverix> Something like that
[06:40:09] <no5thdimension> i tried it, no avail
[06:40:57] <djQuery> need to get off this dev build of chrome. keeps crashing each time i open the dev tools
[06:44:33] <no5thdimension> yep, its a problem with tables
[06:44:33] <no5thdimension> http://jsfiddle.net/869XF/
[06:44:37] <no5thdimension> any solution?
[06:47:06] <djQuery> sublimenal: $('.thickbox').bind('click', function(e) {e.preventDefault();
[06:47:43] <knapper_tech> is it possible to append a load?
[06:48:12] <le_gars> hey I have a question about selecting #id the fastest way
[06:48:32] <sublimenal> thanks for the help its working great now
[06:48:35] <djQuery> no5thdimension: well thats not a valid table structure
[06:48:54] <le_gars> what would you say is the fastest? Doing this $("div#id") or $("#id") ??
[06:49:12] <le_gars> I've heard directly on ther id
[06:49:25] <djQuery> le_gars: $('#id')  will use the native document.getElementById
[06:50:00] <le_gars> yes and that would be faster right???
[06:50:13] <Raverix> omitting the tag is faster, in both javascript and css.
[06:50:14] <djQuery> native will always be fastest
[06:51:24] <djQuery> BUT at times like when you are using the same script on multiple pages where <span id='a'> and <div id='a'> might mean different things I dont see it being harmfull to use div#a
[06:51:43] <no5thdimension> even with a proper structure: http://jsfiddle.net/869XF/1/
[06:52:37] <le_gars> djQuery: yes you are right good input
[06:52:45] <le_gars> good to know
[06:54:33] <djQuery> no5thdimension: how is that proper structure with td nested directly inside a table? table only accepts <thead> <tbody> and <tr> for the most part definetly not <td> and <a>
[06:55:54] <no5thdimension> sorry, i didnt update the example http://jsfiddle.net/869XF/2/

[06:59:01] <Whirl3d> L4suicide, clearInteral(num); delete num;
[06:59:07] <L4suicide> well I want to do something 75 times, unless something happens before that 75 times which is not based upon my script
[06:59:37] <Whirl3d> or use a loop with break;
[06:59:56] <L4suicide> Hrm, i've seen the first arg can be an expression, so I guess I could do (x>0 && function() && etc,number)?
[07:01:21] <L4suicide> a loop with a break?
[07:02:37] <Whirl3d> while (count<75 && condition==false) {  stuff }     --- or for (var i=0;i<75;i++) { if (condition) {break;} do stuff;}
[07:03:10] <L4suicide> how would I then get it to only do my stuff every 3 seconds?
[07:04:06] <djQuery> no5thdimension: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/869XF/3/
[07:04:30] <Whirl3d> var count=0; var timer=setInterval(dosomething, 30000);    function doSomething() { if (condition) or count>75) {clearInterval(timer); do something else} count++};

[07:06:53] <vector_xyz> hey guys is anyone good here in writing plugins.. ? i need some help
[07:06:54] <djQuery> towel day is coming
[07:07:12] <djQuery> ?ask@vector_xyz
[07:07:12] <bot-t> vector_xyz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:07:32] <djQuery> i am pretty good at widget plugins not so good at standard
[07:09:16] <vector_xyz> well i have a default option called  onSuccess: function(event, ui) { }, now if I do $(".lala").myPlugin({ onSuccess: function(event, ui) { alert(event); } }); event is passed properly but i get 'undefined'
[07:09:16] <no5thdimension> thank you djQuery. any ideas on this one? http://jsfiddle.net/869XF/4/
[07:09:23] <vector_xyz> it seems not to be accepting params :/
[07:09:33] <vector_xyz> unless im doing it wrong
[07:09:57] <vector_xyz> so onSuccess may be overwritten by the user... or else it uses the default one.
[07:10:07] <vector_xyz> if not overwritten params exist.
[07:10:13] <vector_xyz> if overwritten event, ui == undefined
[07:10:14] <djQuery> no5thdimension: well seeing as how they are no longer in the same table closest isnt going to work for you anymore. they are not in the same branch of the tree anymore.
[07:10:37] <vector_xyz> this is how i call them fyi  options.onSuccess.call(event, ui);
[07:10:44] <vector_xyz> ^ invoking the function
[07:11:03] <liminal> Im using a Jquery plugin with my wordpress blog that isnt being called by my current theme
[07:11:13] <liminal> is anyone here experienced with wordpress?
[07:11:26] <drasz> hi, anyone use jqgrid?
[07:11:28] <dragoonis> liminal: -> #wordpress
[07:11:32] <no5thdimension> ok, got it. ill just bang all the tables into a parent div and select the div
[07:11:39] <no5thdimension> cheers djQuery!
[07:11:41] <liminal> yeah they sent me here
[07:12:02] <knapper_tech> will a load/get etc cause a document.ready event?
[07:12:03] <dragoonis> liminal: alright. then ask your question and someone may reply 2 u
[07:12:17] <knapper_tech> if there's a document.ready inside the loaded data?
[07:12:25] <dragoonis> knapper_tech: you should wrap all your JQ code inside the document.ready() callback anyway
[07:12:35] <knapper_tech> it is
[07:12:38] <dragoonis> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {});
[07:12:42] <dragoonis> then what's your problem ?
[07:12:52] <knapper_tech> i'm loading a div that includes some new jscript
[07:13:06] <knapper_tech> and i'd like to call a method in the new data without knowing the name
[07:13:16] <djQuery> no5thdimension: also hasClass returns a boolean and will not be chainable in that fashion
[07:13:42] <dragoonis> knapper_tech: not sure then
[07:14:05] <knapper_tech> i guess i'll use a generic function name.    is there any way to call a function defined in script tags within a certian div?
[07:14:53] <djQuery> no5thdimension: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/869XF/5/
[07:16:25] <knapper_tech> wait a minute...  if  the load has some <script> tags that define some new objects etc, when that data gets loaded into the document, are those functions living code?
[07:16:35] <knapper_tech> objects*
[07:16:53] <djQuery> knapper_tech: see .getScript
[07:16:57] <djQuery> ?getscript
[07:16:57] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/

[07:17:29] <_ramo> how can i equip all <a> tags on a page with an onclick handler?
[07:18:27] <djQuery> _ramo: equip?
[07:18:28] <vector_xyz> $(a).live('click', function() { alert('clicked!'); });
[07:18:32] <vector_xyz> ops
[07:18:36] <vector_xyz> $('a').live('click', function() { alert('clicked!'); });
[07:18:42] <vector_xyz> or use .click
[07:18:47] <_ramo> what means live?
[07:18:50] <djQuery> ?delegate
[07:18:51] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:18:52] <_ramo> thank you i'll try it
[07:18:54] <djQuery> ?live
[07:18:54] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:19:27] <vector_xyz> djQuery: do you know why if i do myFunc.call(params); the params never get passed
[07:19:37] <djQuery> vector_xyz: think u got lost in the suffle
[07:19:56] <djQuery> got a link or jsfiddle?
[07:20:02] <djQuery> vector_xyz: ^^
[07:21:26] <vector_xyz> yep 1s
[07:21:54] <vector_xyz> http://jsfiddle.net/kCrnr/
[07:22:01] <vector_xyz> i just renamed it to .apply
[07:22:07] <albacker> how do you change the cursor (pointer, default etc.) ?
[07:22:13] <vector_xyz> to see if that would work... same.. if i do the alert(r) within the ajax success: the 'r' exists.
[07:22:17] <vector_xyz> it has html
[07:22:35] <djQuery> vector_xyz: $('selector').plugin('option', option);
[07:22:50] <vector_xyz> yes but what if i have a function
[07:22:51] <vector_xyz> like
[07:22:54] <vector_xyz> onSuccess:
[07:22:58] <vector_xyz> not just a var
[07:23:15] <dxgriffiths> albacker: css("cursor", "pointer")
[07:23:33] <albacker> dxgriffiths, thankyou
[07:23:37] <vector_xyz> see: success:
[07:23:53] <vector_xyz> basically i want the 'r' that ajax gives me as a param
[07:23:56] <vector_xyz> redirect it to another function
[07:25:24] <djQuery> I would create and ajaxOptions object. ajaxOptions = {defaults}  if (options.queryString) {ajaxOptions.data = options.queryString;} repeat for each option
[07:25:28] <albacker> dxgriffiths, $('.foo').mouseover( $(this).css('cursor', 'pointer') );  ??
[07:26:18] <dxgriffiths> albacker: You can just set that in CSS, using .foo:hover { cursor: pointer }
[07:26:25] <JSBracher1> Hello, anyone home?  I have a quick question, I hope....
[07:26:43] <djQuery> dxgriffiths: or better yet $('.foo').hover(function(e){ $(this).toggleClass('pointerclass');});
[07:27:09] <dxgriffiths> djQuery: Cheeky :)
[07:27:13] <djQuery> dxgriffiths: but just plain css would be best
[07:27:33] <dxgriffiths> What's up JSBracher1?
[07:28:00] <djQuery> ?ask@jsbracher1
[07:28:01] <bot-t> jsbracher1, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:28:25] <JSBracher1> Hello, I'm using the validaiton plugin I have a long form, and I selectively hide and show parts to make it more manageable.
[07:28:54] <djQuery> JSBracher1: are you making them disabled as well so that the validation plugin ignores them?
[07:29:02] <JSBracher1> Naturally, the validation button and the required fields are in different "slides".
[07:29:32] <JSBracher1> what I'd like to do is if validation fails, I make the section with the required fields visible.
[07:29:40] <albacker> dxgriffiths, well apparently i don't need the :hover in css.
[07:29:47] <JSBracher1> I"m very rusty on JS, and new to jQuery.....
[07:29:54] <dxgriffiths> albacker: this is true.
[07:30:03] <vector_xyz> http://pastie.org/1961360 anyone know why onError never receives the parameters... am i implementing the .apply wrong
[07:30:12] <JSBracher1> I'm looking at "$("#myform").validate().form()", but not sure how to fit what I need to into that.
[07:30:18] <djQuery> JSBracher1: yes but depending on how they are not displayed the validation may still fail on it
[07:31:03] <JSBracher1> validation is working, but at the moment, the user has to know to click on the right section to see the validation failure flags.
[07:31:24] <dxgriffiths> vector_xyz: Replace apply with call, unless you're wrapping the c in an array like apply(a, [c])
[07:31:27] <JSBracher1> I just need to know where to put the show & hide code so clue the user in.
[07:31:45] <djQuery> JSBracher1: are u using a validation summary? or the default of putting it next to the error field.
[07:31:54] <JSBracher1> default.
[07:32:09] <JSBracher1> the summary would still need to show the section that needs fixing.
[07:32:43] <djQuery> $('.error:first').closest('.slide')   gets you the first slide that has an error
[07:33:02] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, when using show() animates on transparent PNG's on IE the alpha layer doesn't fade back to transparent until the animation is totally finished -- is there an easy way to resolve this that doesn't involve setting html{display:none;} for IE :D?
[07:33:06] <djQuery> JSBracher1: so then just change to that slide
[07:33:36] <djQuery> suggest that you validate on the change of slides though so that they dont have to go back
[07:33:46] <JSBracher1> exactly.  But where do I put the code for that?  I regret to say my resemblance to a clueless newbie is pretty horrible right now.
[07:34:04] <MorpheusXnl> goodafternoon all
[07:34:10] <djQuery> JSBracher1: well what are u using for slides?
[07:34:10] <dxgriffiths> Heya.
[07:34:21] <JSBracher1> I thought about validating along the way, but didn't know how to make that work either.
[07:34:27] <MorpheusXnl> i have a problem on which i am pounding my head for hours
[07:34:38] <JSBracher1> <shrug>  I know what my home work is for the next few weeks.
[07:35:10] <JSBracher1> the fieldsets are hidden when complete, making the next one visible.
[07:35:11] <djQuery> do hidden slides have a css that is applied to the hidden ones? can you extend that to do .hiddenslide input {disabled: disabled;}
[07:35:18] <JSBracher1> yes.
[07:35:26] <MorpheusXnl> so i include files via $.get and that works good but when i have a form in one of those fields none of my code is responding to the post action.
[07:35:27] <JSBracher1> not disabled, just hidden.
[07:35:35] <woozly|job> how to encode to json with jQuery?
[07:35:40] <dxgriffiths> JSBracher1: try stripping it back to the last stage where you knew what everything did, and then build back slowly. That always helps me.
[07:36:02] <djQuery> but depending on how they are hidden calling validate may still check inputs that they havent gotten to yet
[07:36:03] <MorpheusXnl> if i watch the source code from the browser i also do not see the included code
[07:36:24] <djQuery> but if the inputs that are not visible are disabled then validation will not apply to them
[07:36:26] <JSBracher1> Sadly, the main problem is unfamiliarity with JQuery (but liking what I can make work), and js knowledge that predates dinosaurs.
[07:36:41] <JSBracher1> everything is an object now... ;)
[07:36:45] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: When browser are you using?

[07:38:00] <woozly|job> dxgriffiths, thank you
[07:38:12] <JSBracher1> and thanks to everyone for the help and suggestions.
[07:38:15] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: Get it... it's worth it.
[07:38:17] <MorpheusXnl> dxgriffiths, no i don not have that. but i was wondering if it is even possible when you include a file with a form that it responds
[07:39:28] <djQuery> JSBracher1: $('form').validate(); $('button.next').click(function(){  if($('form').valid()){  code to display next "slide"}  } })
[07:39:28] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: What kind of include do you mean?
[07:39:30] <JSBracher1> I hid the inputs rather than disable them to ensure they stayed available to the form.
[07:39:46] <djQuery> JSBracher1: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/valid
[07:40:17] <MorpheusXnl> well i use $.get to include a file. and in that file is a form for which i have written some code
[07:40:21] <JSBracher1> I can make that work!
[07:40:25] <JSBracher1> thanks!
[07:41:20] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: Is the code for handling the form events in the included file, or in the host page?
[07:41:31] <MorpheusXnl> the host page
[07:41:37] <MorpheusXnl> dxgriffiths, in the host page
[07:42:08] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: Ok well the problem may be that the handlers are being set before the form exists. You'd either need to set them after the .get finishes or, use live().
[07:42:24] <ptriller> Hi, is there no error callback in the jquery-ui autocompleter ?
[07:43:02] <MorpheusXnl> ok uhmmm let me look into that
[07:44:30] <Jon47> not really a jquery question but maybe someone in here knows the answer.. is there a name for the "underscored-delimited" alternative to camelCase, like.. if i make variables that look like "foo_bar" what would that formatting standard be called?
[07:45:35] <sero|work> Jon47: "Underscores" is what I've been accustomed to seeing.
[07:45:45] <sero|work> versus "CamelCase"
[07:45:59] <jaql> is it possible to submit a remote form with post data with the click of an anchor tag?
[07:46:11] <Jon47> sero|work, cool, thanks :)
[07:46:39] <Jon47> jaql, check out .ajax
[07:46:46] <Jon47> and.. .click
[07:46:53] <djQuery> Jon47 see ?.camelcase
[07:46:57] <jaql> i thought that only worked with local content
[07:46:58] <bot-t> djQuery, #8346 (jQuery.camelCase() & jQuery.css() incompatible with IE ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8346
[07:47:23] <t4nkd> Is camelcase vs underscore naming convention choice with jQ? I've
[07:47:39] <t4nkd> mostly seen camelcase but..
[07:47:44] <Jon47> i think with javascript, it's generally a good idea to go with camelCase
[07:47:59] <Jon47> all the jquery code is camelCased, all the native dom methods and elements are camelCased
[07:48:05] <ablomen> t4nkd, most of the language is camelCase, so i'd stick with that
[07:48:33] <t4nkd> cool, thanks guys, just cuerious
[07:48:34] <djQuery> jaql: $('a.submit').click(fucntion(e){e.preventDefault(); $('form').submit();});
[07:48:54] <ablomen> except for things like typeof etc (no idea why that is not typeOf) but hey
[07:49:10] <jaql> djQuery: is it best to just have a hidden form that submits to the remote site then?
[07:49:35] <t4nkd> huh, funny observation though I guess it's only object names that're cC
[07:50:39] <djQuery> jaql: depends on what you are doing. if you are using multiple forms you might want something like $('a.submit').click(function(e){e.preventDefault(); $(this).closest('form').submit();});
[07:51:46] <djQuery> jaql: also see ?.ajaxform
[07:51:47] <bot-t> jaql, ajax form | jQuery Plugins - jquery-ahm is a light-weight jquery plugin that reduces ajax requests to one-line . http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/ajax-form
[07:52:42] <djQuery> jaql: this is the one I was trying to direct you to http://jquery.malsup.com/form/

[08:05:01] <b3ngt> What does the .simplemodal mean? At bind('click.simplemodal' [...]
[08:08:03] <MorpheusXnl> dxgriffiths, thank you i changed to $("#verzend").live ('click', function etc
[08:08:14] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: cool.
[08:08:21] <MorpheusXnl> dxgriffiths, and now it works. it can access the ID of the included file.
[08:08:44] <MorpheusXnl> dxgriffiths, can you tell me when i look at source code from the browser the included code is not vissible
[08:08:50] <MorpheusXnl> why is that
[08:09:23] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: If you mean View Source, that only ever shows you what came down in the original transfer of the .html document.
[08:09:55] <dxgriffiths> MorpheusXnl: To access other loaded resources you need to use a proper set of developer tools, like Safari/Chrome Web Inspector or Firebug.
[08:10:05] <MorpheusXnl> dxgriffiths, aha off course and there are no refreshed due to jquery so source doesn get updated stupid me

[09:07:50] <ch3mical1> cmager: If you want the "html" that creates that element, you need to select the parent element and filter for that element before chaining .html()
[09:08:31] <Guest90293> help
[09:08:32] <Guest90293> http://jsfiddle.net/EkAeH/18/
[09:08:36] <ch3mical1> cmager: if the reason you want the "html" for the element is because you want to duplicate it or move it somewhere else, there are functions for that
[09:08:57] <phlp> Guest90293: your if is missing the closing bracket. if you format your code better it would be easy to see
[09:09:08] <ch3mical1> Guest90293: You need to ask a question, don't just cry for help and give us a link.. what is the problem you're having?
[09:09:46] <cmager> ch3mical1: i actually want to sourround it by <div class="foo">...</div>
[09:09:57] <ch3mical1> cmager: see ?.wrap()

[09:10:22] <ch3mical1> See? There's a function for that :P

[09:14:59] <ch3mical> Ugh, too early for this -_-
[09:15:04] <Guest3542> should I use ajaxStop?
[09:16:21] <alocay> coderiffic: thanks, I didn't know the space between div1 and div2 was necessary
[09:16:47] <Coderiffic> without the space it looks for a div with ID of Div1 AND class of Div2

[09:23:45] <maxmoore14> need help with the commented line here please: http://jsfiddle.net/BLDFS/
[09:24:08] <maxmoore14> it is a counter widget
[09:25:02] <maxmoore14> works great except if I uncomment the bind to 'paste' and 'focus', I get an error
[09:25:20] <maxmoore14> definitely something wrong with the way I am doing the settimeout
[09:25:57] <maxmoore14> 'self' is not getting passed the way I think it should
[09:27:08] <futini> oihlkj
[09:27:58] <phlp> maxmoore14: did you mean to remove the ; on the previous line?
[09:28:31] <maxmoore14> phlp: yes, that is just there so it runs with the line commented
[09:28:59] <phlp> what is the error?
[09:30:04] <maxmoore14> in the _count function, the first line: var currentText = this.options.textElement.val(); throws an error because 'this' refers to the global object
[09:30:24] <maxmoore14> so it says this.options does not exist
[09:34:47] <phlp> maxmoore14: does this work setTimeout($.bind(self._count,self));
[09:36:06] <hillct> Good afternoon all. Can anyone recommend a calendar widget that facilitates marking linkable content for certain days, in an organized way, that could easily be generated programatically?

[09:42:11] <phlp> maxmoore14: not sure if that is the correct way to do it. i think $.proxy may actually be what you want http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy

[09:56:49] <Guest90293> A question I have a text are input field
[09:56:57] <Guest90293> with a class of .text1
[09:57:23] <Guest90293> I wrap it inside  var value(".text1").val();
[09:57:38] <Raverix> That's wrong.
[09:57:46] <Guest90293> what is wrong?
[09:58:05] <Raverix> If you're trying to get the value of the input, then you need var value = $(".text1").val();
[09:58:29] <Guest90293> ok
[09:59:38] <robzob> So.. it looks like it's not possible for a disabled input to register click events? Is it possible to do this?
[09:59:40] <Guest90293> thanks
[10:02:04] <railslord> hi
[10:02:15] <railslord> I do build my first jquery plugin
[10:02:33] <railslord> But i can into this: $this.someMethod is not a function
[10:02:48] <robzob> railslord: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring learn
[10:02:56] <railslord> Thats what i read
[10:03:06] <railslord> i do have the return this each()…
[10:03:10] <Kambfhase> ?p @ railslord
[10:03:10] <bot-t> railslord, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[10:03:11] <djQuery> robzob: <label  >Click me<input disabled="disabled" /></label>
[10:03:36] <robzob> djQuery: ah and handle the click w/ the label? good call
[10:03:55] <railslord> Pasted: http://jsfiddle.net/kYjRG/
[10:04:22] <railslord> Error in this line: $this.changeDate(new Date());
[10:04:25] <railslord> $this is broken
[10:06:26] <djQuery> robzob: and you should be handling the inputs focus most likely not its click. this way you get both click and tab events to it
[10:06:39] <Guest90293> @Raverix can I pass the value of .text1 through a function meanin the value of value which is .text1 then pass var value as an argument of function(value)
[10:06:40] <Guest90293> ?
[10:06:46] <djQuery> but again you can't focus a disabled item
[10:07:14] <Guest90293> guys can I pass value as the argument of the function http://jsfiddle.net/W89ym/7/
[10:07:14] <Kambfhase> railslord: as far is I understand your code, the only method you add to the jQuery object is .weekCalendar()
[10:07:16] <Guest90293> in here
[10:07:17] <djQuery> Guest90293: that made no sense to me
[10:07:23] <robzob> djQuery: yeah that's my problem, hmm that label thing isn't working, maybe i need some css to expand it around the input. i'm trying to create a disabled input that enables when you dblclick()
[10:07:27] <Guest90293> go to this fiddle
[10:07:27] <Guest90293> http://jsfiddle.net/W89ym/7/
[10:07:40] <Reedyseth> jotos !!!!!!!!
[10:07:42] <Kambfhase> so you cannot call changeDate directly
[10:07:55] <Reedyseth> xD just kidding !
[10:07:55] <Guest90293> I want to print the value of .text1 field in the p tags #ahi
[10:08:01] <railslord> Kambfhase: I cant?
[10:08:16] <Guest90293> right now it is displaying a blank space
[10:08:17] <railslord> But i need to. It's the init method
[10:08:20] <Reedyseth> yes you can do that
[10:08:30] <Guest90293> Reedy you talking to me?
[10:08:32] <Kambfhase> you need to add chnageDate to $.fn to be able to do that
[10:09:03] <Guest90293> can I pass value variable here as the argument as the following function?
[10:09:03] <Reedyseth> Guest90293:  you just need to save the value of the .text1field into a variable and then write that value in the p tag
[10:09:04] <Guest90293> http://jsfiddle.net/W89ym/7/
[10:09:30] <Guest90293> write it or dynamically echo it?
[10:09:38] <djQuery> Guest90293: why not just put you comment inside an actual form ?
[10:10:02] <Guest90293> I already have it in a value reedyseth var value = $(".text1").val(); am I right?
[10:10:05] <djQuery> Guest90293: then use this to submit it behind the scense http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[10:10:32] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: i don't remember exactly but there is a function to write in the p tag, so you get the value into a variable and then do something like $(p).write(myMsg);
[10:10:33] <Guest90293> inside an actual form
[10:10:33] <railslord> Kambfhase: That sound wired
[10:10:34] <Guest90293> ?
[10:10:57] <Guest90293> instead of doing it the way I am doing it now
[10:10:58] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: I'm just giving you the idead
[10:11:00] <djQuery> $(p).html(myMsg);
[10:11:02] <bot-t> Reedyseth, .html(htmlString): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[10:11:08] <Reedyseth> i mean idea
[10:11:49] <Guest90293> I don't fucking understand man it is frustrating don't get the idea thanks for your pointing guys but I don't get it yet
[10:11:56] <Kambfhase> railslord: try $this.weekCalendar('changeDate', new Date());
[10:12:03] <Guest90293> wait
[10:12:11] <Guest90293> djQuery
[10:12:18] <Guest90293> I did like that and it is not printing any thing
[10:12:22] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: yes, is frustating at first but then the ideas will come
[10:13:00] <railslord> member:railslord: Working. But now the next method is not be found
[10:13:14] <railslord> Do i always have to write $this.weekCalendar? Is there not shorthand?
[10:15:30] <railslord> ?
[10:16:03] <Guest90293> ok Reedy instead of puting $(p).html(comment); I could point to the id of the p tag which is $("$ahi").html(comment);
[10:16:05] <Guest90293> right?
[10:16:29] <Kambfhase> railslord: if you explicitly do $.fn.changeDate = methods.changeDate; you can simply call it
[10:16:30] <Guest90293> well I am pointing tot eh id right now and it will print but a blank space when I point to the
[10:16:47] <Guest90293> tag $(p) instead it will not even print a blank space
[10:17:06] <railslord> Kambfhase: Sry, dont understand that

[10:17:38] <Guest90293> let me check that
[10:18:57] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: Yes you can do that, but also you can use a function name innerHTML
[10:20:07] <Guest90293> InnerHTML let read about that
[10:20:14] <Guest90293> bot-t what is that for?
[10:20:18] <ch3mical> Don't confuse the poor guy
[10:20:22] <Guest90293> that a debbuger or just something to read
[10:20:42] <ch3mical> Guest90293: read the info in that link, you will learn how to debug your script
[10:20:59] <railslord> Kambfhase: Can you provide more help on this?
[10:21:48] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: I'm coding something for you
[10:22:57] <Kambfhase> railslord: add $.extend( $.fn, methods); to the very bottom of the function.
[10:23:16] <railslord> of which function?
[10:23:35] <ch3mical> *facepalm*
[10:23:47] <Kambfhase> the on big function wrapping around all of your code
[10:24:10] <railslord> ok, bevore })(jQuery) – right?
[10:24:15] <Kambfhase> yeah
[10:24:45] <Kambfhase> ch3mical: dont flame noobs too fast. javascript is hard
[10:24:50] <cuqaaa> hola. I am trying to learn some jquery right now and want to build a multi level navigation. However, I have a problem selecting a specific element
[10:24:56] <Guest90293> reedy this change the text
[10:25:04] <cuqaaa> so lets say <ul><li><a href="#1"><ul><li><a href="#sub1"></li></ul></li></ul>
[10:25:07] <Guest90293> but will it also insert it ?
[10:25:11] <cuqaaa> how would I select the <li> element of <a #1>
[10:25:15] <Guest90293> I have the INSERT query done already
[10:25:34] <Kambfhase> ?parent @ cuqaaa
[10:25:34] <bot-t> cuqaaa, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[10:25:40] <cuqaaa> I tried everything with .parent(), .prev(), .closest() and so on
[10:26:07] <Follow|BRNDN> try .find()
[10:26:15] <Kambfhase> o.O
[10:26:23] <railslord> Now i get this: this.each is not a function    -    Code: http://jsfiddle.net/qyjDZ/
[10:26:51] <Vaerros> why not just $("a[href='#1'] li")?
[10:27:24] <Vaerros> also, multi-level dropdown navs...bah
[10:27:39] <robzob> Question: How do I make all the text be selected when an input gains focus?
[10:27:52] <ajpiano> ?mdc select @ robzob
[10:27:53] <bot-t> robzob, select - MDC Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/select
[10:27:55] <Kambfhase> railslord: oh, haha, rename that init function to something else
[10:27:55] <Vaerros> I would argue that there should be max 2 layers(A->[a,b,c])
[10:27:56] <ajpiano> meh
[10:28:03] <railslord> Kambfhase: What's wrong with your fix?
[10:28:08] <cuqaaa> when I use .parent() the parent <ul> is chosen. I even tried .parent().parent() but then the level 1 list is selected
[10:28:10] <ajpiano> there's a select method,, robzob, just call it on the input element itself, not the jquery object
[10:28:19] <Kambfhase> you override the jQuery internal init
[10:28:36] <robzob> awesome thx ajpiano i'll give it a shot
[10:29:08] <railslord> Kambfhase: I thought i did it the way jquery suggests?
[10:29:17] <railslord> @see http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[10:29:37] <Vaerros> brettgoulder: I thought your nick was 'buttgrinder' for some reason ._,
[10:29:42] <robzob> it works! thank you ajpiano and jquery
[10:29:45] <Kambfhase> well, yeah, but you wanted to be able to call your changeData directly
[10:30:08] <railslord> I want my methods to call each other (just like in a normal class)
[10:30:19] <railslord> with this.methodName()
[10:32:59] <mahen23> hello world
[10:33:16] <mahen23> i am trying to do a 		$("#overlay").css({width : '100px'}).speed('slow');
[10:33:27] <mahen23> but it says speend not found
[10:33:28] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: are you still there??
[10:33:47] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: I have the solution to your problem
[10:33:55] <Kambfhase> ?animate @ mahen23
[10:33:55] <bot-t> mahen23, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:34:11] <sear|work> ^^ Kambfhase
[10:34:15] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: flame? Who is flaming?
[10:34:23] <ch3mical> Kambfhase: WTF are you talking about?
[10:34:35] <Kambfhase> m(
[10:34:37] <Reedyseth> where do you paste code here?
[10:34:45] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Reedyseth
[10:34:45] <sear|work> Use pastebin
[10:34:45] <bot-t> Reedyseth, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[10:34:58] <Reedyseth> thank you bot :p
[10:35:18] <railslord> Kambfhase: Sorr, man. But i am still stucked with this error
[10:35:21] <Kambfhase> bot-t: are you a bot?
[10:35:21] <bot-t> Kambfhase, Outlook not so good.
[10:35:22] <DarsVaeda> hi, I open dialog windows with jquery ui and have a form in there to save, I fetch all inputs from that dialog with the ":input" selector... sometimes it happens that it fetches the inputs of the last opened dialog, not the actual one, does that ring a bell?
[10:35:50] <djQuery> Guest90293: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/W89ym/8/
[10:36:04] <djQuery> Guest90293: still workin on it a bit
[10:36:34] <ch3mical> DarsVaeda: check your selector... when you see it pulling the wrong one, go to the console and put in $(whatever selector you are using in your script).length
[10:36:39] <Kambfhase> railslord: tellin you, if you want to stick with the official way and not spam the jQuery namespace use $('div').weekCalendar('changeDate');
[10:36:52] <mahen23> Reedyseth: i tried $("#overlay").css({width : '100px'}).animate('10000000');, but its still too fast
[10:37:00] <railslord> Kambfhase: But that's what i do!
[10:37:00] <mahen23> i want a slow transition
[10:37:27] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: My code is simple, it just change the p value for wherever you got in you input
[10:37:32] <ajpiano> mahen23: ???
[10:37:47] <Kambfhase> mahen23: the first parameter to .animate() is a properties object. read the docs
[10:37:49] <mahen23> ajpiano: i  am trying to animate the css change: $("#overlay").css({width : '100px'}).animate('10000000');
[10:37:53] <sear|work> Reedyseth: I think that this will help you: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:38:03] <ajpiano> mahen23, did you forget the API??
[10:38:08] <ajpiano> ?animate#sig
[10:38:08] <bot-t> .animate( properties, [duration], [easing], [callback] ) | Returns: jQuery | Added in v1.0. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:38:16] <mahen23> i never used animate()
[10:38:23] <mahen23> how do we use that?
[10:38:31] <sear|work> Read the documentation I just linked
[10:38:34] <ajpiano> $("#foo").animate({width: "100px"}, 1000000);
[10:38:46] <sear|work> or that ^^
[10:38:56] <mahen23> ah
[10:39:17] <sear|work> Although I believe the selector has to be a string literal as well, does it not?
[10:39:34] <sear|work> ajpiano: ^^
[10:39:46] <ajpiano> hm?
[10:39:58] <sear|work> You would have to pass width in quotes, right?
[10:39:59] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: this is the code working http://jsfiddle.net/cR6t9/
[10:40:01] <ajpiano> no
[10:40:12] <sear|work> Oh, okay.  Never mind me then.  :P
[10:40:16] <ajpiano> keys in object literals can be quoted or unquoted
[10:40:25] <sear|work> Oh okay,  that makes sense.
[10:40:57] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: did you see the code?
[10:41:18] <railslord> Kampbfhase:  $('div').weekCalendar('changeDate');  calls the changeDate method, but inside this method i need to call other methods as well. And again i do get the "_firstDayOfWeek is not defined" error
[10:41:45] <Kambfhase> use the same pattern
[10:41:52] <bittyx-laptop> i have a two forms with (nearly) identical code. only difference - the first has a single text input, the second one has two text inputs. both have events bound for .submit() that do something (say, console.log, not important). when i press the enter key in the first form, .submit() gets triggered. however, when i press enter in either of the two input boxes in the second form, it doesn't fire. doing $('#form2').trigger('submit'); from the cons
[10:41:52] <bittyx-laptop> ole works as expected. what could be causing this?
[10:41:54] <mahen23> oh sheeeeeeeeeetttt it Worked!
[10:42:00] <sear|work> Glad to hear it!  :)
[10:42:28] <railslord> Kambfhase: I should always use weekCalendar('method') inside my plugin?
[10:42:34] <Kambfhase> yes
[10:42:39] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: does the 2nd form actualy have a method and a submit button?
[10:42:46] <railslord> Do you have any example plugin working like this?
[10:42:51] <railslord> sounds like a lot of overhead
[10:43:23] <djQuery> railslord: are you using the widget factory model for your plugin?
[10:43:35] <railslord> No, I dont. Never heard of it
[10:44:20] <djQuery> railslord: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[10:44:35] <Reedyseth> Guest90293: you didn't say if the code helped you !
[10:44:41] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: both forms have a method, and neither has a submit button. as i said, the only difference is that the second form has two inputs, while the first form has only one.
[10:45:11] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: can you paste them somewhere? see ?jsfiddle

[10:45:18] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: i was more asking to find out if there is some known fact why this doesn't work, since debugging it is gonna be a PITA
[10:45:26] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: there has to be another difference
[10:45:37] <blaa> Somebody knows why I have this bug? In localhost it works fine: http://screencast.com/t/lafAPwFl but online don't: http://screencast.com/t/nmSyEIX4
[10:45:39] <blaa> please?
[10:45:54] <railslord> Widgets are the new Plugins?
[10:46:10] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: i think it's gonna take me a while to narrow them down, but i'll try. be back soon...
[10:46:14] <mahen23> guys, i am doing this on click: 	$("#overlay").animate({width: "800px", height: "400px"}, 500); , but how do i toggle back to normal on click?
[10:46:32] <ajpiano> mahen23: removeAttr("style")
[10:46:49] <mahen23> onclick?
[10:46:49] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: how can i see if there is a function bound to a .submit event from the console?
[10:47:15] <bittyx-laptop> (sorry for the highlight, that's not directed at you specifically)
[10:47:21] <ajpiano> mahen23: yes, in the click handler for the elemenet
[10:47:26] <AaronDCampbell> Where can I download ui 1.8.9?  I know it's not current, but it's what WordPress 3.1 uses and I need the accordion element from it
[10:47:27] <Reedyseth> mahen23: instead of using onClick you toggle
[10:47:41] <Reedyseth> you use toggle
[10:47:47] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.9/jquery-ui.js
[10:48:24] <AaronDCampbell> ajpiano: but I JUST need the accordion...not everything in one file
[10:48:36] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell, i hate to say this sarcastically but
[10:48:49] <ajpiano> are you familiar with the find, select, and copy features of your computer
[10:48:55] <ajpiano> :p
[10:49:21] <MorpheusXnl> ok so i got a $.ajax which has a succes part. and in the succes part i want to get the data wich is processed so i can display it at the screen. i know it is succes becuase my animation part works but i can same to get the data while i said in my php file echo $variable
[10:49:28] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: I was able to replicate it in jsfiddle in about 30 secs. 2nd form on same page as first form does not auto submit when there are more than 1 input in the form
[10:49:30] <MorpheusXnl> can anyone help me on this one
[10:50:20] <brdma_> if I'm binding an function to an event using a selector such as $('a'), which I assume selects all links, how would I obtain the top/left position of the 'a' that has triggered the event?
[10:50:39] <ajpiano> brdma_, in the event object that is passed to the handler
[10:50:53] <ajpiano> or in the handler itself
[10:50:56] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: ugh, so that's a browser limitation?
[10:51:03] <brdma_> Well, that's what I can't figure out.
[10:51:11] <brdma_> so if I'm using mouseover, for example...
[10:51:14] <ajpiano> you can either grab the clientX and clientY properties for the click itself, or get $(this).offset() for the clicked element's coordinates
[10:51:14] <brdma_> and e is my evetn object
[10:51:20] <AaronDCampbell> ajpiano: yes...but then I have to make the minified version myself as well.  I guess I can, but what a pain.  Why aren't the older versions just avaialble for download?
[10:51:36] <railslord> Can so offer a simple jquery plugin example? Just need to start with sth already working ;-)
[10:51:38] <Reedyseth> coman caca !!
[10:51:53] <MorpheusXnl> anyone
[10:51:54] <MorpheusXnl> ?
[10:51:55] <Guest90293> JUST ONE QUESTION function(html) {} in this function html can be anything an argument just like in php ?
[10:52:07] <djQuery> bittyx-laptop: seems like it but you should be able to work around it by capturing the key press of the last input and detecting a return pressed the calling submit on the closest form
[10:52:16] <brdma_> Ah, got it ajpiano... thanks :)
[10:52:32] <brdma_> $(this) is what I as unware of.
[10:52:37] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.9/jquery-ui.min.js
[10:52:37] <brdma_> (no pun intended)
[10:52:58] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: yeah, that's what i'll do now, but i didn't know about it. hey, thanks a bunch for helping! you're awesome!
[10:52:58] <ajpiano> brdma_ woot :) ps, if you like 'this' puns, then you'll really like my preso about debugging jquery

[10:53:25] <mahen23> http://jsfiddle.net/MzQjP/ < there
[10:53:25] <AaronDCampbell> ajpiano: which is a PAIN to find and copy/paste the correct bits for JUST the accordion.  Now you're just being a pain on purpose
[10:53:31] <brdma_> Feel free to link it :)_
[10:53:34] <ajpiano> i am not being a pain on purpose.

[10:53:41] <Guest90293> function(html) {} in jS functions work as php ? is html an argument which menas it can be anythin?
[10:53:43] <djQuery> railslord: there is a good example in the slides http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide17
[10:54:06] <mahen23> http://jsfiddle.net/MzQjP/ < i click on the overlay it becomes bigger, but when i click again, i want it to become smaller
[10:54:21] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell, my bad.  i thought there was a better delineation in the minified file
[10:54:27] <Guest90293> question does html work as an argument for the function function(html) {?
[10:54:28] <mahen23> i can painfully try to get the current width and blah blah
[10:54:38] <mahen23> but i want a better way
[10:55:00] <Guest90293> function(html) {} is html an argument here?
[10:55:17] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell, short story, we're working on getting downloads for the old things, but i don't think we're gonna ever be able to have download builder for older versions
[10:55:19] <Guest90293> hello people
[10:55:21] <ajpiano> Guest90293, yes it is,
[10:55:29] <ajpiano> but you can't FORCE an argument to be defined just by putting it htere
[10:55:54] <mahen23> ajpiano: ....
[10:56:02] <Guest90293> Thanks ajpiano meanin I can dfine by  var html = $("#text1").val();  putting this spnipet before the function ?
[10:56:11] <Guest90293> and html will get the value of #text1?
[10:56:12] <ajpiano> Guest90293: meanning you *can't* do that
[10:56:16] <djQuery> function(html){ var test = html || 'Hello World'; }
[10:56:29] <ajpiano> Guest90293: just do that variable, and then the html variable will be available in the function
[10:56:32] <mahen23> djQuery: hey nice nick
[10:56:32] <Guest90293> var test will echo the content?
[10:56:33] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: just found the culprit: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_8.html#SEC8.2 <--- "When there is only one single-line text input field in a form, the user agent should accept Enter in that field as a request to submit the form." --- it's not explicitly stated, but it implies that the browser shouldn't accept enter if there is more than one field, though, i don't think i've ever encountered this problem - i've never, for example,
[10:56:33] <bittyx-laptop> used a work-around for a user/pass login with 2 text inputs, and ENTER always worked as a submit trigger... weird.
[10:56:41] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell http://fixee.org/paste/nftt6gh/
[10:56:42] <mahen23> djQuery: what are the latest beats?
[10:56:51] <ch3mical> Is there a dead-simple way to remove leading zeros from integers, or do I have to mess around with split/join?
[10:56:59] <MorpheusXnl> ajpiano, maybe you can help me to
[10:57:06] <Guest90293> how can I define the variable of html function argument ?
[10:57:15] <djQuery> mahen23: Perry Como
[10:57:20] <Guest90293> I want to be equal to an id of a input fields
[10:57:20] <MorpheusXnl> it is in the same region i think
[10:57:30] <rsobers> mahen23: what's so painful about testing the current width/height?  are there only 2 states: big and small?
[10:57:32] <Guest90293> and I was meaning weather I could just define like this  var html = $("#text1").val();
[10:57:39] <Guest90293> before the function
[10:57:40] <Guest90293> ?
[10:57:43] <Guest90293> can I ?
[10:57:43] <mahen23> rsobers: wut?
[10:57:47] <Guest90293> just like php
[10:57:52] <ch3mical> Guest90293: yes, but .val() is not html
[10:57:59] <ch3mical> Guest90293: .html() is html
[10:58:04] <Guest90293> ok
[10:58:07] <polyrhythmic> ch3mical: leading 0 in base 10?  then it must be a string
[10:58:21] <polyrhythmic> ch3mical: try casting it to a number with Number(value)
[10:58:21] <rsobers> mahen23, You said that you wanted the overlay to shrink when you click it a second time, correct?
[10:58:24] <MorpheusXnl> ok so i got a $.ajax which has a succes part. and in the succes part i want to get the data wich is processed so i can display it at the screen. i know it is succes becuase my animation part works but i can same to get the data while i said in my php file echo $variable
[10:58:29] <bittyx-laptop> djQuery: and yeah, it seems that if you supply an input type="submit", enter will work as expected (so that's probably why i've never seen this before, i think this is a first time i've made a multiple-input form without an input type="submit"). live to learn. anyway, thanks so much for your help, once again.
[10:58:29] <Guest90293> but .val() is meant to be there to let the line knows it is a variable
[10:58:32] <ch3mical> polyrhythmic: ok I'll try that, thanks
[10:58:33] <MorpheusXnl> ajpiano, maybe you can look
[10:58:35] <MorpheusXnl> pls
[10:58:37] <mahen23> rsobers: yep
[10:58:40] <ajpiano> i can't
[10:58:41] <polyrhythmic> ch3mical: np
[10:59:00] <Guest90293> anyways it is not working with .val()
[10:59:05] <rsobers> mahen23, so why not just look at the current size of the overlay to determine whether a click results in a grow or shrink?
[10:59:09] <Guest90293> let me try to put .html();
[11:00:10] <Guest90293> didn't work
[11:00:27] <Guest90293> how can I define the html argument in that function?
[11:00:36] <ch3mical> polyrhythmic: like a charm, thanks
[11:00:44] <Guest90293> function(html) {} how can I define the html argument here?
[11:00:51] <mahen23> i mean sheeeeeesh
[11:01:02] <mahen23> while you were arguing
[11:01:07] <mahen23> my theory worked
[11:01:12] <polyrhythmic> ch3mical: :)
[11:01:13] <mahen23> its the big bang theory
[11:01:20] <Guest90293> guys
[11:01:21] <Guest90293> {} how can I define the html argument here?

[11:02:08] <ajpiano> Guest90293: what are you actually trying to do
[11:02:13] <ajpiano> please stop spamming the same question every minute
[11:02:25] <DarsVaeda> hi, I set values of inputs with "value=foo"...when fetching those inputs after they were changed with user input, it still takes the "values" value :(
[11:02:42] <ajpiano> you can't define the arguments of a function by setting a variable before the functioning and putting the variable inside of where the arguments go
[11:03:12] <ajpiano> cause that will literally make that variable be undefined inside of the function
[11:03:38] <Guest90293> ajpiano I am trying to get a value to html argument
[11:03:50] <rsobers> mahen23, http://jsfiddle.net/ZLhuP/1/
[11:03:52] <ajpiano> Guest90293: it doesn't have to be an argument probably
[11:04:00] <SkiOne> I am trying to add a custom attribute to an OPTION, how do I get the value of the current select custom attrib, this is what I have http://pastebin.com/vJpCSBTm
[11:04:24] <ajpiano> Guest90293, why can't you just do var foo = $("#bar").html(); and then $("#somethingElse").click(function() { // use foo variable;   });
[11:04:30] <tman> is there a method which checks to see if an element even exists on the page?
[11:04:31] <SkiOne> the option tag looks like this <option child="value">Text</option>
[11:04:51] <ajpiano> tman: if ($("#foo").length) { }
[11:04:56] <tman> :visible is failing/
[11:04:59] <tman> ah
[11:05:04] <tman> right.
[11:05:08] <Guest90293> ok I have to do it outside the functino
[11:05:13] <ajpiano> Guest90293: yes
[11:05:16] <Guest90293> good
[11:06:24] <SkiOne> nvm $('#'.$('option:selected', this).attr('child')).show(); dud what I needed
[11:07:51] <Guest90293> ajpiano I did it outside the function click()
[11:08:00] <Guest90293> and it did come out empty
[11:08:10] <Guest90293> how can I print the value of html
[11:08:15] <mahen23> rsobers: check it out, its a new user interface in the making: http://mobilemru.com/web_templates/bentu/
[11:08:16] <ajpiano> Guest90293: you are going to have to create a demo of your code that you're trying to use
[11:08:17] <Guest90293> I have define
[11:08:23] <Guest90293> ok
[11:08:42] <mahen23> rsobers: the background image could be scrolling

[11:11:19] <MorpheusXnl> is there anyone that could advise me
[11:12:35] <liminal> I have two javascripts calling  jquery for my wordpress theme,, they seem to conflict.
[11:12:50] <liminal> is it possible to have two jquery scripts running?
[11:13:31] <mahen23> liminal: ya me too i always asked this, can we have two different versions of jquery running at the same time?
[11:14:09] <davidjQuery> mahen23: liminal: 2 differenct versions is not a good idea.
[11:14:31] <ajpiano> it is, however, possible.
[11:14:58] <davidjQuery> liminal: haveing 2 $(docment).ready(function(){}); will work with no issues.
[11:15:13] <mahen23> davidjQuery: even with older versions ?
[11:15:18] <davidjQuery> ajpiano: the first one would have to be loaded in no conflict mode right
[11:15:25] <ajpiano> <script src="jquery-1.5.1.js"></script> <script> var jq151 = jQuery.noConflict(); </script> <script src="jquery-1.4.2.js"></script> <script> var jq142 = jQuery.noConflict(); </script>
[11:15:28] <ajpiano> yes
[11:15:52] <russpete> I'm trying to submit a form with a data-remote="true" attribute when a checkbox is checked, using onclick="jQuery('#task_assigned_25').submit();", but it does a regular post instead of an ajax call. Here is a gist of the code https://gist.github.com/987200
[11:16:31] <ajpiano> russpete: how would the form know to sumit via ajax just from that
[11:16:32] <muhdick> hey how do i make it all ids with opt-in-email  get a script
[11:16:35] <muhdick> i mean i did
[11:16:43] <ajpiano> ?
[11:16:43] <muhdick> $("#opt-in-email").watermark('Email', { top: 10 });
[11:16:44] <davidjQuery> cool so I can work around 1.6 breaking validat
[11:16:49] <muhdick> but that only applies to the first one
[11:16:58] <ajpiano> muhdick, give them a class
[11:17:03] <ajpiano> or use another selector...
[11:17:05] <ajpiano> that isn't the id
[11:17:07] <muhdick> ti already has a class
[11:17:08] <russpete> ajjpiano: isn't that what the data-remote="true" indicates?
[11:17:13] <ajpiano> so use it
[11:17:22] <muhdick> i mean the class is used for something else tho
[11:17:24] <ajpiano> russpete: not that i know of, maybe yo'ure using some framework?
[11:17:32] <muhdick> class="label-hint"
[11:17:33] <ajpiano> muhdick, that doesn't mean you can't use it for this
[11:17:55] <muhdick> i mean im not sure if i want all items with a java script rollover to say email
[11:17:59] <muhdick> if its a textbox
[11:18:05] <russpete> ajpiano: yes, it is in a ruby on rails framework, I'll try that channel again
[11:18:07] <muhdick> i mean only once that are opt in emails
[11:18:12] <ajpiano> muhdick: the bottom line is use a selector that matches the elements you want to select
[11:18:28] <muhdick> can an item have two classes?
[11:18:32] <russpete> they didn't liek the question because it sounded like too much jQuery
[11:18:54] <ajpiano> muhdick, where did you get the idea that data-remote="true" magically makes something submit via ajax
[11:18:57] <ajpiano> muhdick: yes
[11:19:07] <muhdick> i mean can i huh?
[11:19:14] <muhdick> i didnt say remote dat true
[11:19:18] <ajpiano> oops
[11:19:27] <ajpiano> russpete, where did you get the idea that data-remote="true" magically makes something submit via ajax
[11:19:38] <ajpiano> muhdick: yes an element can have multiple space-separated classes
[11:19:41] <t432> Can append() a form value into an array?
[11:19:44] <t432> we*
[11:19:49] <muhdick> ok thans
[11:19:55] <ajpiano> t432: huh?
[11:20:12] <ajpiano> you want to put a value into an array? or you want to put a form control into the DOM?
[11:20:16] <russpete> ajpiano: read it somewhere in my muttled search for an answer.
[11:20:44] <ajpiano> russpete, there is probably another part of that working that you overlooked
[11:20:51] <t432> nvm
[11:27:22] <MorpheusXnl> guys when i post a form $.ajax sends it to a process.php file in this file my last line is echo $variable. how do i get this data visual on my screen via the success part of the $.ajax
[11:28:13] <Anitox> the output from the process.php will be the argument to the success function
[11:28:30] <Anitox> success: function(data){ $('body').append(data); });
[11:28:46] <Anitox> minus the );
[11:28:46] <MorpheusXnl> Anitox, let me give that a try
[11:31:04] <MorpheusXnl> Anitox, i already had that but i am a bit stupid because the div which needed to show this info had a default css of display none so adding.show() helped a lot lol
[11:31:20] <Anitox> doh!
[11:31:27] <rsobers> I'm trying to add margin to a div based on the height of its content, which includes an image.  I'm doing the calculation in a callback to a function that checks to make sure all images are loaded, but I'm seeing some inconsistencies

[11:58:22] <swiggy> its throwing a weird DOM error on jsfiddle tho
[11:58:56] <swiggy> its exactly the same code
[11:59:18] <rsobers> So, it looks like even though imageObject.complete is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the element containing said image has resized.  How can tap into that event?
[11:59:53] <rsobers> (imageObject.complete == true means the image is done loading)
[12:00:53] <tman> $("#primary ul > li").css('margin-bottom','30px'); <- why does that target nested ul lis ?
[12:01:54] <ch3mical> tman: because ">" means children of lefthand selector
[12:02:21] <tman> ch3mical: then how do i express it?
[12:02:26] <tman> using .not() ?
[12:02:26] <ch3mical> eh?
[12:02:41] <tman> i want to targert ONLY the lis of the first ul, not nested lists.
[12:03:15] <ch3mical> Try taking out the >
[12:04:46] <tman> naw
[12:04:52] <tman> that targets all lis of the set
[12:05:13] <railslord> Do i need widget or plugin?
[12:06:33] <ch3mical> tman: I think you'll have to be more specific about what you're trying to do exactly
[12:07:06] <robzob> tman: can you do something like $("#primary ul:first li");
[12:07:18] <tman> nope didn't work either.
[12:07:21] <tman> this did:
[12:07:26] <tman> $("#primary ul li").not("#primary ul li ul li").css('margin-bottom','30px');
[12:07:28] <tman> ugly as sin.
[12:07:32] <ch3mical> robzob: that doesn't change whether he is selecting nested uls

[12:26:32] <hendrikadriaanbo> Hi, im looking for a jquery programmer (paid) who can work something out. budget xx please give me a message if interested
[12:27:55] <imsky> who needs help with jquery :D
[12:30:20] <Primer> I know this may sound odd, but is there any way to load an image into a browser by obtaining the binary image content via ajax? I'm doing this as part of an automated test suite of a server API, and would like to avoid hitting server twice just because this is an image.
[12:31:51] <rindolf> Primer: you can set up an <img src="..." tag with the binary data.
[12:32:12] <ajpiano> http://www.greywyvern.com/code/php/binary2base64
[12:32:28] <Primer> yeah, but usually that entails it be base64 encoded, no?
[12:32:38] <ajpiano> ya
[12:32:39] <Primer> The server API returns proper images
[12:32:43] <Primer> not base64
[12:33:08] <imsky> wow sounds like they need to learn about mime-types
[12:33:16] <imsky> feels like i'm back in 1994
[12:33:16] <Primer> Eh?
[12:33:20] <Primer> The mime type is set
[12:33:23] <hendrikadriaanbo> Anyone interested in a paid jquery job ?
[12:33:25] <Primer> I'm in control of the server API
[12:33:50] <rsobers> it looks like even though imageObject.complete is true (i.e., the image has been loaded), it doesn't necessarily mean that its containing element has resized to fit it.  How can I tell when this happens?
[12:33:55] <rindolf> hendrikadriaanbo: I am.
[12:34:06] <ajpiano> Primer: http://emilsblog.lerch.org/2009/07/javascript-hacks-using-xhr-to-load.html ?
[12:34:15] <Primer> ajpiano: looking
[12:34:46] <Primer> ajpiano: again, looks like that's server side base64 encoding
[12:35:37] <Primer> ok, wait, I looked farther down
[12:36:43] <Primer> wow, base64 encoding in js...looks like exactly what I need. Thanks!
[12:37:04] <ajpiano> there's a gooe lib for that besides the one he provides there
[12:37:22] <gnarf> ajpiano: i need a gooey lib
[12:37:30] <ajpiano> wat
[12:37:43] <imsky> i got some gooey
[12:37:44] <imsky> libs..
[12:42:04] <railslord> I am still stucked with plugin development
[12:42:20] <railslord> I have no idea how to provide public method which has access to private methods
[12:42:50] <ajpiano> railslord: you should use the widget factory , it does the basic thing for you
[12:43:02] <ajpiano> you could also use jQuery.sub()
[12:43:23] <railslord> ajpiano : So Widgets are the new Plugins?
[12:43:26] <ajpiano> there is this new lib that uses sub for it's implementation
[12:43:28] <ajpiano> http://ninjaui.com/
[12:43:40] <ajpiano> railslord: i mean, if you want to say that, maybe...
[12:43:52] <ajpiano> a widget, at least in jquery ui terms, implies something that is stateful
[12:44:02] <ajpiano> and occupies a single plugin namespace on the jQuery prototype
[12:44:43] <ch3mical> ninjaui isn't as smooth as jqUI on accordian animations
[12:45:06] <ajpiano> i was just saying it has a plugin pattern that utilises sub
[12:45:22] <scrieler> hi, is it possible to get jquery rounded corner working with google maps?
[12:45:52] <Vaerros> can't seem do blur selects with jquery
[12:45:55] <ch3mical> Yeah, no worries, I'm just nitpicking their stuff
[12:46:08] <Vaerros> $('select').blur() doesn't do what I thought it would
[12:46:13] <Vaerros> tips?
[12:46:23] <ch3mical> blur is an event
[12:46:28] <ch3mical> see ?.blur()
[12:46:28] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[12:46:37] <Vaerros> aye, but you can use it trigger
[12:46:41] <Vaerros> to*
[12:47:40] <ch3mical> So it will do whatever you bound with .blur(), then, if it's not doing what you thought, then check your event handler
[12:51:03] <Vaerros> what? default behavior would be to make the element lose focus, which is all I need
[12:51:37] <Vaerros> afaik
[12:52:23] <ch3mical> No, it doesn't make it lose focus, it just does something AS IF it lost focus
[12:53:09] <Vaerros> I see
[12:53:14] <ch3mical> Just like triggering .change() on an element doesn't actually change the element. You'd have to set something with .html .text or .val to do that.
[12:53:36] <ch3mical> ?g focusing elements with javascript
[12:53:37] <bot-t> ch3mical, dom - How do I find out which Javascript element has focus ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/497094/how-do-i-find-out-which-javascript-element-has-focus
[12:53:51] <ch3mical> Not exactly what I was looking for, Google. -_-
[12:54:53] <Vaerros> strange, because at least for text inputs, .focus() gives the element focus
[12:55:00] <Vaerros> so you would think .blur() would remove focus
[13:03:25] <ch3mical> Vaerros: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/bc6qE/ I can't get either to behave that way
[13:03:57] <ch3mical> Vaerros: do you have an event binding for focus? Maybe that's why it's selecting it when you do .focus()?
[13:05:02] <Vaerros> hm
[13:05:22] <Vaerros> ch3mical: you're using mootols
[13:05:25] <Vaerros> mootools*
[13:05:27] <m0dmd> what's up everyone.
[13:05:58] <Vaerros> m0dmd: up? nothing is looking up, nor should it...hope is the first step on the road to disappointment
[13:06:50] <ch3mical> Vaerros: oops, forgot to set that :)
[13:06:57] <Vaerros> ch3mical: it's a conspiracy
[13:07:26] <ch3mical> Vaerros: Well, in that case, you're right, blur does unfocus the element. So maybe you're selecting wrong?
[13:07:30] <m0dmd> there's no difference between looking up towards success or failure.
[13:07:38] <m0dmd> It can be looking down as well.
[13:07:45] <m0dmd> It's all conspiracy.
[13:09:38] <valberg> hi - anyone here with jQuery Cycle plugin experience?
[13:09:38] <ch3mical> Also, it seems that doing a .blur() on an element either triggers a click on the parent or the document element
[13:10:03] <Vaerros> what the
[13:10:05] <valberg> I want to specify per .cycle('next') which fx to use - is there a way of doing so?
[13:10:28] <ch3mical> It's doing something weird
[13:11:14] <swiggy> how do i tell how many textboxes there are that ARE empty?? I tried --->  $('input[id^="email"]:empty').length;
[13:11:18] <valberg> I want use scrollLeft for .cycle('next') and scrollRight for .cycle('prev')
[13:11:21] <swiggy> but it just returns the TOTAL number
[13:11:29] <swiggy> not if they are empty or not
[13:12:23] <Vaerros> ch3mical: propagation
[13:12:42] <Kambfhase> swiggy: :empty is not what you want
[13:13:22] <ch3mical> Vaerros: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/bc6qE/2/ , if you click the input, it triggers a click on the body. I don't think it's propagation.
[13:13:37] <Kambfhase> try $('input[id^="email"]').filter(function(){ return $(this).val() == "";})
[13:13:57] <Vaerros> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/bc6qE/3/
[13:13:58] <ch3mical> Vaerros: I know it has nothing to do with what you're doing, but it's just odd. Thought you'd find it interesting. :P
[13:14:36] <ch3mical> Backwards propagation?
[13:15:08] <Vaerros> *shrugs*
[13:15:11] <valberg> d'oh - just have to use fx: 'scrollHorz'
[13:15:28] <ch3mical> I'll have to read more about propagation, I guess.. I thought it only traversed down the tree, not up it
[13:15:52] <sandwiches> ch3mical: event propagation?  it only makes sense to travel up.
[13:16:13] <ch3mical> sandwiches: look at the example
[13:16:26] <davidjQuery> Kambfhase: $('input[id^="email"][value=""]')
[13:17:58] <swiggy> that will return true/false Kambfhase ?
[13:18:32] <Kambfhase> no, that will return the set of inputs with an epmty value
[13:18:36] <ch3mical> Maybe I'm thinking of delegation
[13:19:13] <Kambfhase> davidjQuery: ftr: that will fail on inputs with no value attribute.
[13:19:35] <davidjQuery> Kambfhase: swiggy:   $('input[id^="email"]').filter(function(){ return this.value == "";}) would be a little faster.
[13:22:31] <swiggy> that returns an object
[13:22:34] <swiggy> not the number
[13:22:48] <djQuery> .length then
[13:22:55] <swiggy> [object OBJECT]
[13:24:24] <swiggy> instead of where?

[13:33:55] <Krinkle> djQuery: well, it thinks wrong :P It even makes an Xhttprequest (not a script tag) from what I can see in the debugger
[13:34:10] <Krinkle> I know about Sop.
[13:34:35] <snover> Krinkle: jquery always appends a callback parameter if you are requesting with jsonp
[13:36:01] <swiggy> .lenth is an [onject OBJECT] too
[13:36:14] <railslord> How do i define class vars for a ui-widget factory?
[13:36:45] <Krinkle> snover: Hm..
[13:36:56] <Krinkle> So my application is sending dataType 'jsonp' instead of 'json' ?
[13:37:02] <Krinkle> lemme see
[13:37:39] <Krinkle> Nope, dataType: 'json'
[13:37:53] <Krinkle> It's requesting to the current domain with dataType: 'json'.
[13:38:02] <Krinkle> and since upgrading from 1.4.4 to 1.5.2 it appends a callback parameter.
[13:38:50] <Kambfhase> railslord: you mean like "static" as in Java?
[13:39:11] <railslord> i mean: a var i can access in ever method of my class
[13:39:18] <railslord> a private var
[13:39:45] <Kambfhase> yeah, you do use that factory, pattern from the jq website, right?
[13:40:18] <railslord> No, it's custom
[13:40:21] <Kambfhase> so you have this big function spanning all over your code. just create a var in there and all your code will be able to see it
[13:40:30] <railslord> Based on a image-subline demo
[13:40:43] <Kambfhase> ah, well, what you need it called a "Closure" << google that
[13:40:54] <railslord> you mean before? $.widget("ui.captionator", {
[13:41:06] <railslord> oh sry.
[13:41:19] <railslord> First i need to access the options
[13:41:40] <railslord> I need to access the options from inside a private method
[13:42:49] <railslord> ok thats easy: this.options
[13:43:28] <railslord> ok next
[13:43:56] <railslord> How to i access vars i create in _create:
[13:46:22] <a_L_p> I have a div set to a specific height and have overflow set to hidden, I would like to use jquery to check if the div has content that is overflowing and therefore hidden, and if so present a link to expose the hidden content. Does anyone out there no of a way to check if a div has overflowed content?
[13:47:46] <Anitox> compare clientHeight to scrollHeight?
[13:47:46] <Primer> Is there any way to specify that a call to $.ajax is returning binary data?
[13:48:27] <Primer> I added a jquery base64 plugin to feed this binary data into, but I have a feeling something's getting corrupted somewhere
[13:52:51] <railslord> Can anyone simplify this http://jsfiddle.net/9xXF3/ ?  (found it somewhre)
[13:53:35] <a_L_p> Anitox: thanks, I will see if I can get that to work...
[13:54:14] <Kambfhase> railslord: yes, want a hint or want me to do it?
[13:54:48] <dnyy> is there a way to know when image is fully loaded (before showing it)? http://pastie.org/1963098
[13:55:09] <Anitox> onload?
[13:55:11] <railslord> Do it ;-)
[13:55:13] <Anitox> for the img
[13:55:18] <wailqill> dnyy: onload
[13:55:32] <railslord> I can read and lear quite fast
[13:55:40] <dnyy> k, let me try that
[13:55:46] <Kambfhase> railslord: you were talking about thet _rotate, right?
[13:55:53] <railslord> yeah
[13:56:42] <railslord> i think i can delete this
[13:57:23] <railslord> sry ,wrong window.
[13:57:26] <railslord> i need the method!
[13:58:24] <Krinkle> djQuery: snover: When I do $.ajax({ url: '/foo.php', dataType: 'json', success: function(){ } }); the request made is http://localhost/test.php?callback=jQuery15209770830729976296_1306181857724&_=1306184
[13:58:32] <Krinkle> Is that a bug ?
[13:58:58] <Krinkle> the web app I'm using is treating the request as 'foreign' if a callback parameter is passed.
[13:59:38] <snover> Krinkle: I’m not sure how a call with url /foo.php would result in a request going to /test.php
[13:59:52] <Krinkle> snover: ... Sorry, you get the idea.
[14:00:02] <Kambfhase> railslord: you want to roatate left, right?
[14:00:28] <Phoenixz> I can use .getScript() to load a javascript file and execute it. What method should I use to load (and implement) a .css file?
[14:00:31] <railslord> yes, i think so
[14:00:46] <Kambfhase> :)
[14:01:25] <Krinkle> Phoenixz: $("<link/>", { rel: 'stylesheet', type: 'text/css', href: '/path/to.css' }).appendTo('head');
[14:01:28] <Krinkle> something like that ?
[14:01:41] <Anitox> shazam!
[14:03:25] <Kambfhase> railslord: http://pastebin.com/r4q6w5ps
[14:05:05] <railslord> mhm...
[14:05:07] <Krinkle> It's not supposed to append a callback parameter. -_-,
[14:05:14] <railslord> i replaces my function but yours doenst work
[14:05:33] <Kambfhase> hmm?
[14:06:56] <railslord> I ll just kick that one out
[14:07:06] <railslord> I dont need a "setStartDay"
[14:07:13] <railslord> I will always be monday ;-)
[14:07:21] <Kambfhase> way to go
[14:09:00] <Phoenixz> Krinkle: thanks! just... there is not some pretty shortcut? Guess I have to add it myself using .fn() ?
[14:09:18] <railslord> Kambfhase: let's call it a day: http://jsfiddle.net/NAjgQ/
[14:09:32] <Krinkle> Phoenixz: Sure, although this kind of shortcut should be in $. not $.fn. ;-)
[14:09:39] <railslord> / i'll fix the last lines now
[14:10:02] <Kambfhase> railslord: looks good, but move the first vars into the function
[14:10:13] <railslord> yeah
[14:10:25] <Kambfhase> http://jsfiddle.net/NAjgQ/1/
[14:10:51] <Krinkle> $.getStyle = function( url, media ) {  return $( link, { rel: ..., href: ..., type: ..., media: media || 'all' }).appendTo('head'); }
[14:10:57] <Krinkle> railslord: Something along those lines.
[14:11:07] <Krinkle> eh, Phoenixz ^
[14:11:17] <abjorn> Wha-why-what? Keanu Reeves is playing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? Oh dear lord, more like Dr. Neo and Mr. Neo.
[14:11:24] <railslord> ok http://jsfiddle.net/hE3Kp/
[14:13:57] <a_L_p> can someone tell me how to set a variable to the scrollHeight value of a div with the class of .bio?
[14:18:04] <Anitox> ?.outerHeight
[14:18:05] <bot-t> .outerHeight([includeMargin]): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[14:22:56] <mitsoni13> hello folks, I used append to insert a form field in the dom, but for some reason the data isn't posted after submition. is this normal?
[14:24:13] <mitsoni13> anyone please?
[14:25:22] <ravenzz> `p @ mitsoni13
[14:25:28] <scrieler> mitsoni13, how did u post? per input submit button?
[14:25:31] <ravenzz> ?p @ mitsoni13
[14:25:32] <bot-t> mitsoni13, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:25:39] <ravenzz> just an ?
[14:25:41] <ravenzz> :p
[14:26:26] <mitsoni13> one sec
[14:26:39] <scrieler> :]
[14:27:22] <Phoenixz> Krinkle: thanks! *that* was what I was looking for :)
[14:28:30] <mitsoni13> scrieler: yes, it's a submit button
[14:34:47] <swiggy> how come .focus() will not focus on a textbox INSIDE of an active .dialog() ???
[14:35:04] <swiggy> i have a dialog with a form and some textboxes
[14:35:12] <swiggy> and i am trying to force a .focus() on an element
[14:35:16] <swiggy> and it will not focus it
[14:36:08] <ravenzz> uffs
[14:36:14] <ravenzz> ?p @ swiggy
[14:36:15] <bot-t> swiggy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:36:16] <ravenzz> :f
[14:36:28] <m0dmd> Is there a better way to write -> self.parent().parent().hide();
[14:36:42] <ravenzz> there are tons of ctrl or v broken here
[14:36:47] <Anitox> give the thing you want to hide an ID?
[14:36:48] <swiggy> post what
[14:36:51] <m0dmd> It works as expected, but wondering if there is maybe an even shorter way of doing it.
[14:36:55] <Anitox> or, use .closest()
[14:36:55] <swiggy> jsfiddle will allow dialogs?
[14:37:00] <ravenzz> sure
[14:37:07] <swiggy> i tired this b4
[14:37:10] <swiggy> and it gave me an error
[14:37:16] <swiggy> (js fiddle)
[14:37:49] <scrieler> mitsoni13, hmm, moment
[14:37:51] <m0dmd> ahhh closest() progressing up the DOM tree. let's try it out
[14:37:52] <m0dmd> :)
[14:37:56] <Anitox> :)
[14:38:28] <m0dmd> HAha that's hot.
[14:38:40] <m0dmd> Still the same amount of characters but using one less method
[14:38:40] <ravenzz> swiggy you should load jQuery UI and his css
[14:38:47] <m0dmd> thanx Anitox :)
[14:38:56] <m0dmd> that was pretty cute
[14:39:01] <railslord> how to i bulid a call back for my widget
[14:39:11] <railslord> e.g. if the user clicks a button i want a method to be fired
[14:39:30] <m0dmd> can't you put the method inside the click handler?
[14:39:35] <m0dmd> Oh e.g
[14:39:37] <m0dmd> Sorry :)
[14:39:44] <railslord> ;-)
[14:39:56] <dtach> odd request but is it possible to find an element .menuButton and check their href matches something?
[14:40:02] <m0dmd> railslord also phplord?
[14:40:07] <railslord> no
[14:40:10] <m0dmd> I mean, also good at PHP
[14:40:11] <m0dmd> :)
[14:40:12] <scrieler> mitsoni13, your code?
[14:40:24] <dtach> so find a button that has a specific href
[14:40:24] <m0dmd> I gotta get into ASP for a client.
[14:40:34] <dtach> button i mean link
[14:40:46] <m0dmd> They want me to learn ASP so they can release their current developer.
[14:41:06] <m0dmd> Rails seems like something nice to get into as well.
[14:41:16] <mitsoni13> scrieler: actually my code is a mess, I'm using a callback from http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ipod_style_and_flyout_menus/ script and cakephp for backend
[14:42:31] <mitsoni13> but it seems that when an input is inserted after the page is loaded
[14:42:41] <mitsoni13> the form doesnt use it
[14:42:45] <mackry> Would anyone know why jQueryUI autcomplete appendTo: "#selector" option would not be working? It still get's appended to the body.
[14:43:21] <alexi5> hello
[14:43:32] <scrieler> mitsoni13, are u sure it isnt because any input id is missing for the cms?
[14:44:17] <mitsoni13> i triple checked it
[14:45:10] <scrieler> without code I can't help u, sry, I am tired, I need sleep, if u still need help tomorrow, I am here
[14:45:30] <scrieler> good neight all
[14:45:33] <mitsoni13> thank you anyway
[14:45:37] <mitsoni13> gn
[14:53:17] <railslord> whats wrong with this?
[14:53:17] <railslord> self._trigger('change', 0, 1);
[14:53:44] <railslord> $("#test").bind('change', function(){…});
[14:54:30] <Jon47> _trigger?
[14:54:34] <Jon47> i think it was just .trigger
[14:54:52] <Wulf> If I make an ajax request with { type: 'POST', headers: { 'X-MyHeader': 'somedata' }, ... }, how likely would it be that the proxy server, a user might use, filters my custom header?
[14:55:26] <Jon47> and "change" is only an event on inputs..
[14:56:06] <railslord> no its _trigger
[14:57:35] <Jon47> looks like no underscore to me: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:57:40] <Jon47> _trigger might be an internal method..
[14:58:46] <Krinkle> It is indeed an internal method
[14:58:53] <Krinkle> What're you trying to tho ?
[15:02:21] <railslord> Provide a event to listen for a click
[15:02:27] <railslord> whats what i was trying to do
[15:02:34] <railslord> but the event doesnt work
[15:04:45] <lisak> guys what is the proper combination for $.ajax(options) to send a multipart request with File  using File API ?
[15:05:00] <lisak> a removed FormData from my plugin
[15:05:45] <lisak> and options.data = {file: file}   doesn't work nomatter if I processData or not
[15:06:01] <a_L_p> anitox: thanks for the direction... .outerHeight() appears to give the height of the object but excludes any content that is overflowing.. is there something to get the height of the entire element including scrollable material?
[15:07:56] <lisak> well it cannot be processed if it is File
[15:08:08] <lisak> *no matter what content-type I use
[15:12:23] <Jon47> lisak, you cannot send files via ajax
[15:12:35] <Jon47> because javascript is not allowed access to the filesystem the way a browser is
[15:12:45] <lisak> file api spec
[15:12:59] <lisak> html5
[15:13:09] <Jon47> ah, that's news to me, good luck to ya
[15:14:26] <YammYgirlcoding> guys. I'm trying to use jquery.lightbox here, but it's all messy and i can't figure it out.

[15:15:37] <YammYgirlcoding> the buttons are not showing or rendering custom paths. and the gray background is moved aside the page
[15:22:34] <m0dmd> YammYgirlcoding it would be best to start with the demo version of lightbox so you can understand how to work your way around it.
[15:22:49] <m0dmd> All of your issues are easy to figure out, just start by using the demo and playing with the code.
[15:23:00] <m0dmd> Make sure to keep the documentation loaded as well./

[15:40:36] <Brad_> anyone here work with touchstart event and jquery?
[15:41:03] <Phoenixz> Can .animate() work with max-height going from '100%' to 'none' ? If not, how could I fix this?
[15:42:03] <Phoenixz> I need images that are inside a div to animate between the div height and its own height, if the image is larger than the div...
[15:45:10] <Phoenixz> I need images that are inside a div to animate between the div height and its own height, if the image is larger than the div...
[15:46:59] <vacho> can someone please tell me why when I select an item drop the suggestions from jquery autocomplete, it does not append it to the inputbox.. http://pastebin.com/N7YapRH0
[15:53:31] <djQuery> because u need to go look at the examples again
[15:53:59] <djQuery> you are only doing renderitem and that is just how it is displayed in the autocomplete

[16:16:25] <dipser> does someone know if jquery has changed something to hashchange?
[16:19:44] <MistuhKurtz> changed something to hashchange?
[16:19:51] <MistuhKurtz> the plugin, dipser ?
[16:19:59] <MistuhKurtz> the HTML5 thingamabob?
[16:20:12] <KingTarquin> I have a webform which uses an <a> type button. When it is clicked, it is replaced with a gif. If an error is found, it is changed back to a button. But then this button doesn't work again.
[16:20:24] <dipser> i am using http://routesjs.com/
[16:20:54] <dipser> jquery-1.5.2.min.js is working... but not 1.6...
[16:22:43] <MistuhKurtz> dipser https://github.com/syntacticx/routesjs/issues/2
[16:22:48] <MistuhKurtz> who'd a thunk
[16:22:50] <MistuhKurtz> :P
[16:23:52] <dipser> whateva man
[16:24:18] <dipser> why should jquery "disable" custom events?!
[16:25:55] <MistuhKurtz> idk dipser
[16:26:00] <MistuhKurtz> just use 1.5.2 for the time being
[16:26:05] <ngharo> it doesnt.  i use em all the time
[16:26:09] <dipser> i will
[16:26:12] <ngharo> he said the problem is in a plugin
[16:26:20] <dipser> but new things are cooler :D
[16:27:10] <dipser> maybe i have misunderstanding that. thanks ngharo
[16:28:25] <MistuhKurtz> the problem is this https://github.com/asual/jquery-address/issues/82
[16:28:30] <MistuhKurtz> it's with jQuery address plugin
[16:38:03] <michaelt1> I have a question about ui-sortable and deferred objects: I have a "trash" div that I call run .sortable on with a receive that fires an ajax DELETE request for items dragged onto the trash div.  I'm using deferreds so that on error I run a $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel'), so that the element that didn't get deleted remains in the DOM.  My question is, how the hell is this working?
[16:38:41] <ekkis> how can I implement an initialisation routine for a plugin?
[16:39:02] <ekkis> I want something to run only once when the plugin library is loaded
[16:39:58] <jaequery> hello everyone, anyone here use your urls such as, http://bla.com/bla/bla/bla/../../bla.png ?
[16:40:10] <jaequery> is that syntatically incorrect? and should be avoided?
[16:40:11] <Skoder> ekkis: I create a private method in the object and call it at the end.
[16:40:36] <ekkis> Skoder: but won't that get called every time the plugin runs for a target?
[16:41:19] <ekkis> so if I do: $('#x').MyPlugin() and then $('#y').MyPlugin() I'll get 2 initialisations, right?
[16:41:35] <Skoder> oh.. its because i usually split it up, and i was thinking about creating an object
[16:42:20] <ekkis> I need to hit the database a single time and then use the data everytime the plugin gets bound to an element
[16:43:49] <Skoder> ekkis: I would just split it into a function where you check if content is fetched, if yes return it, else fetch it and return it
[16:45:53] <ekkis> ah... so I could have a variable inside of my extension that is either empty or not
[16:47:03] <ekkis> $.fn.MyPlugin = function(options) { var MyData = init(); }
[16:47:54] <ekkis> or maybe more like var MyData; if (!MyData) initMyData();
[16:49:10] <Skoder> ekkis: Do you want it only to be fetched when the plugin is used, or when the plugin is being registered ?
[16:49:34] <ekkis> when the plugin is registered
[16:50:02] <YammYgirlcoding> guys. I addded some pictures to fancybox here, but somehow they are not grouping together anymore. http://solveigfloerke.com/2011/de/services.html
[16:50:07] <YammYgirlcoding> any idea?
[16:50:19] <Skoder> then i would just create a shared cache that holds the fetched content.
[16:50:31] <ekkis> Skoder: how?
[16:50:42] <Skoder> if you want it to be lazy you could just wrap it with a helper function
[16:50:49] <ekkis> a variable inside the $.fn.MyPlugin?

[17:01:52] <ajpiano> michaelt1: i was about to go get dinner, what is up
[17:02:13] <michaelt1> I have a "trash" div that I run .sortable on with a 'receive' handler that fires an ajax DELETE request for items dragged onto the trash div.  I'm using deferreds so that on error I run a $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel'), so that the element that didn't get deleted remains in the DOM.  My question is, how is this working?
[17:02:27] <YammYgirlcoding> so, anyone knows fancybox well ? i wonder why my photos don't group together. http://solveigfloerke.com/2011/de/services.html
[17:02:42] <ajpiano> are you asking me to explain how your code is working, when i haven't seen it myself?
[17:02:54] <michaelt1> haha, sort of
[17:02:56] <michaelt1> more generally
[17:03:21] <michaelt1> i get the ajax error response after all of the sortable events have fired
[17:03:33] <geestring> what javascript function(s) should I use if I want to check if "333" or "OMP" is in a variable?
[17:04:10] <michaelt1> so i'm wondering if it's the deferred or the sortable cancel that does the magic to revert any changes
[17:04:16] <ajpiano> ?mdc String.indexOf @ geestring
[17:04:17] <bot-t> geestring, indexOf - MDC Docs - Returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at fromIndex , returns -1 if the value is not found. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf
[17:04:40] <ajpiano> michaelt1: the sortable cancel , eh
[17:04:44] <geestring> thank you
[17:04:48] <ajpiano> the deferred just waits for something else to happen, and then does that
[17:05:34] <michaelt1> okay, i can poke around the sortable source
[17:05:38] <michaelt1> to see what it's doing
[17:09:22] <njbair> I've got a really tricky task and I could use some advice on the approach
[17:09:37] <njbair> is anyone familiar with the messages that appear at the top on stackoverflow.com?
[17:12:56] <coldhead> i think the ones with the highest rating appear at the top
[17:13:00] <coldhead> or is it newest first?
[17:13:07] <coldhead> it's my first day using stackoverflow
[17:15:18] <geestring> i usuallly use php, so i don't know if this following code would work in javascript: bloorarray[] = room;  can you add values like that to an array?
[17:16:02] <ngharo> no, use push()
[17:16:08] <geestring> ah ok cool
[17:16:09] <geestring> thanks
[17:16:52] <Anitox> geestring: i do it like you described
[17:17:39] <ngharo> ?js var a=[]; a[]='foo';
[17:17:40] <bot-t> ngharo: SyntaxError: syntax error
[17:18:20] <Anitox> ?js var foo = Array(); foo[] = "test"; echo foo[0];
[17:18:21] <bot-t> Anitox: SyntaxError: syntax error
[17:18:25] <Anitox> hmm
[17:18:54] <ngharo> thats straight up php yo
[17:19:01] <geestring> haha, yea it doesnt work :)
[17:19:06] <Anitox> eh?
[17:19:28] <geestring> appending data to an array
[17:19:53] <Anitox> ok
[17:20:35] <Anitox> i write code in too many languages
[17:20:39] <Anitox> they blend together
[17:20:43] <geestring> haha yea
[17:20:56] <Anitox> esp. after i just got home from the bar
[17:21:10] <geestring> ok im dealing with a timestamp from an xml i got: 2011-05-10T00:00:00-04:00
[17:21:16] <geestring> im assuming it's a unix timestamp
[17:21:20] <geestring> anyway to parse it?
[17:21:25] <geestring> any way
[17:21:27] <Anitox> thats not unix timestamp
[17:21:31] <geestring> what is it?
[17:21:35] <vacho> DanielHolm, din lilla geting
[17:21:37] <Anitox> dunno
[17:21:44] <geekbuntu> looks like db datetime
[17:21:52] <Anitox> .split('t');
[17:21:55] <DanielHolm> vacho: haha, what?
[17:21:56] <Anitox> or capital
[17:22:07] <DanielHolm> vacho: är jag överallt?
[17:22:18] <Anitox> i give up. im worthless, cant help anyone in this state.
[17:22:35] <geestring> no you're helping :)
[17:23:39] <ngharo> ?js new Date('2011-05-10T00:00:00-04:00')
[17:23:40] <bot-t> ngharo: <2011-05-10T04:00:00.000Z>
[17:24:00] <vacho> DanielHolm, stila dig
[17:24:22] <geestring> so I should place that value in the Date function?
[17:24:45] <DanielHolm> vacho: stila?
[17:25:42] <ngharo> geestring: yeap
[17:25:54] <mcksds> Anyone know much about red blood cells?
[17:26:14] <Anitox> yea, all mine evacuated so the alocohol could be transported
[17:26:23] <mcksds> Without the bone marrow producing blood cells, giving suplements that KILL cancers like lukemia and lung cancer, will it help ?
[17:26:36] <vacho> #soundblaster
[17:26:45] <Anitox> hebogoblins can grab up to 4 oxygen molecules which they will transport to cells that need them
[17:27:20] <Anitox> I dont believe in poisoning yourself in attempt to kill what is living inside you.
[17:28:01] <mcksds> Anitox, my uncle has Lukemia, his bone marrow is no longer producing red blood cells. I've read tremendous stories of medicinal mushrooms, and I believe if i start giving it to him, it'll help.
[17:28:05] <mcksds> 'help'
[17:28:34] <Anitox> I like magic mushrooms
[17:28:41] <mcksds> I'm talking medicinal.
[17:28:49] <Anitox> perhaps they're the same thing?
[17:28:52] <mcksds> Shiitake, Turkey Tail, Lions Mane, Portabello
[17:28:53] <mcksds> no
[17:29:02] <Anitox> oh, i dont usually eat mushrooms
[17:29:05] <Anitox> unless they're magical
[17:29:18] <mcksds> sucks, you should look into medicinal mushrooms
[17:29:20] <mcksds> .
[17:29:27] <Anitox> but, fungus does seem to help with medicinal things
[17:29:45] <Anitox> considering penicillin
[17:30:35] <Anitox> maybe he didnt like that much
[17:30:39] <snover> jquery and homeopathy…
[17:31:00] <geestring> ngharo, I try to alert() my date and it says invalid date.  var dt = new Date('2011-05-10T00:00:00-04:00');  alert(dt);
[17:31:26] <Anitox> it's invalid
[17:31:33] <Anitox> it has a T in the middle, and it has a GMT offset
[17:31:36] <ngharo> works for me
[17:31:50] <ngharo> ?js var d = new Date('2011-05-10T00:00:00-04:00'); d.toDateString()
[17:31:51] <bot-t> ngharo: "Tue May 10 2011"
[17:32:24] <Anitox> maybe not
[17:34:23] <ngharo> i think thats ISO date format
[17:34:33] <ngharo> you'll see them in .ical files and what not
[17:35:21] <geestring> yea some event software is outputting it..
[17:35:24] <geestring> I tried var d = new Date('2011-05-10T00:00:00-04:00');
[17:35:24] <geestring> alert(d.toDateString());
[17:35:31] <geestring> and that says invalid date
[17:35:33] <geestring> weird
[17:35:42] <ngharo> what browser?
[17:36:37] <geestring> ah ok that's it :)
[17:36:51] <geestring> i was using Coda's preview browser, which said it was using firefox
[17:37:04] <geestring> but who knows how it affect javascript. Thanks
[17:44:50] <bananasontoast> Hey guys, I have a question about jQuery UI sortable grid. Is there a way I can make a particular node span across two droppable points? Kind of like this...? http://www.cl.ly/221K3A260T2l1e0x0b1k
[17:51:34] <abjorn> alright guise. lets make some qweriez
[17:52:02] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky I miss him
[17:52:02] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[17:52:08] * abjorn hugs bot-t
[17:52:08] * bot-t hugs abjorn back
[17:53:00] <abjorn> I have way too much time on my hands right now and not enough to do
[17:53:59] <gnarf> abjorn: http://rewardjs.com
[17:54:09] <matter> Hi, I am trying to use a deep linking with JQuery Address and the doc of the Asual website is not very clear to learn how to implement it for your own use..any tips to use this plugin ?
[17:54:28] <abjorn> gnarf: TIME TO FIX SOME BUGS
[17:54:59] <abjorn> oh jquery ui...meeehhhhh
[17:57:48] <gnarf> abjorn: :(
[17:58:14] <MistuhKurtz> matter Address has a bug with 1.5.1
[17:58:16] <MistuhKurtz> sry 1.6.1
[17:58:37] <MistuhKurtz> so keep in mind you'll want to use 1.5.2 with it.
[17:59:08] <abjorn> gnarf: https://github.com/Abjorn/SofaJS I could keep working on this but ehhh I've run out of steam for this thing
[17:59:13] <abjorn> for now anyways
[18:00:51] <matter> I am using jquery.address-1.4.min.js
[18:01:09] <MistuhKurtz> i mean it doesn't work with jquery 1.6.1
[18:01:49] <matter> ah ok, yeah I am using jQuery 1.4.2
[18:02:35] <MistuhKurtz> any reason why 1.4.2?
[18:03:18] <matter> euh..no..just haven't updated my link :)
[18:04:39] <abjorn> brodingo my bru
[18:04:55] <abjorn> :(
[18:14:02] <electronplusplus> Hi
[18:14:13] <electronplusplus> I've a question about WebSockets in HTML5
[18:14:30] <electronplusplus> is possible to use WebSockets to bind on a port as a server?
[18:14:38] <electronplusplus> client side
[18:16:14] <ngharo> i dont think so
[18:16:52] <matter> no one has a good example to use Jquery Address plugin with ScrollTo plugin ?
[18:16:53] <ngharo> or maybe you can, look at socket.io
[18:17:13] <electronplusplus> any particular example in their website? ngharo
[18:18:01] <electronplusplus> matter: are you new in jquery stuff?
[18:18:17] <ngharo> wait no i retract my second statement
[18:18:22] <matter> yes
[18:18:38] <electronplusplus> I'm going to teach a lesson for life
[18:18:55] <electronplusplus> your toilet paper is more useful that jquery documentation
[18:19:13] <electronplusplus> with jquery you have (must) reverse the demos
[18:19:30] <electronplusplus> and you'll notice that are lot of stuff isn't documented
[18:19:38] <ngharo> example?
[18:19:53] <electronplusplus> jQuery UI is the perfect example of what I'm saying
[18:20:17] <electronplusplus> ngharo: working demo
[18:20:18] <matter> yeah I see that, as the jQuery Address plugin is not well documented too
[18:20:24] <Guest33401> Hi! I'm using IIS with asp.net 4.0, jquery and PageMethods. Does anobody know how can I achieve ajax push (comet) with PageMethods? Feel free to point me at webpage. Thanks a lot :)
[18:20:27] <ngharo> jquery ui does have working demos
[18:20:54] <electronplusplus> ngharo: I was talking about socket.io
[18:21:18] <matter> If you want to do something that a bit different, it is getting hard
[18:21:50] <matter> in the basic, it is easy, I just would like to have a Scroll To and have a deep linking with it
[18:21:59] <electronplusplus> I don't say that it is hard. matter
[18:22:09] <Anitox> thats what she said
[18:22:14] <matter> I have my scroll working perfect, just missing the deep linking
[18:22:24] <electronplusplus> the problem is that the documentation is missing a function indication
[18:22:28] <electronplusplus> for example
[18:22:32] <electronplusplus> in autocomplete
[18:22:45] <Javex> Does anybody know how to achieve ajax push ( comet ) with asp.net PageMethods?
[18:22:46] <electronplusplus> the default id ui.item.id, ui.item.value and ui.item.label
[18:23:03] <electronplusplus> but I know this because i spent days
[18:23:05] <ngharo> you should submit a bug if you notice problems with the docs
[18:23:33] <electronplusplus> ngharo: the problem is missing documentation
[18:23:43] <ngharo> same thing
[18:23:45] <electronplusplus> I haven't found a bug yet
[18:24:07] <electronplusplus> a bug is when a well documented thing isn't working
[18:24:31] <ngharo> i'm pretty sure jquery devs track documentation in their bug tracker
[18:24:41] <ngharo> i'm not debating bug vs docs
[18:24:54] <ngharo> i'm just telling you were you can submit problems like missing documentation to
[18:24:58] <ajpiano> electronplusplus: you can create docs bug in trac if you notice a docs error.
[18:25:16] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: not errors, missing stuff
[18:25:26] <ajpiano> same thing
[18:25:39] <ajpiano> on what function?
[18:25:52] <electronplusplus> autcomplete in jQuery UI
[18:26:04] <ajpiano> the "ui" parameter?
[18:26:08] <electronplusplus> yes
[18:26:18] <ajpiano> ah yes, we know that the ui param is under-doc'd on jqueryui.com
[18:26:23] <electronplusplus> in the documentation it doesn't say that you must use id and value
[18:26:41] <ajpiano> what do you mean, that you "must" ?
[18:27:00] <electronplusplus> if I get a json from my php server
[18:27:08] <electronplusplus> It must have the format
[18:27:11] <electronplusplus> id : "234"
[18:27:15] <electronplusplus> value: "Mario"
[18:27:26] <electronplusplus> otherwise the autocomplete won't complete the input box
[18:28:02] <electronplusplus> I noticed this because there's an example using autocomplete
[18:28:06] <electronplusplus> that in function source
[18:28:13] <electronplusplus> they implement $.ajax()
[18:28:24] <electronplusplus> and they map the response in a particular way
[18:28:34] <ajpiano> yes, but it isn't explicit in the docs
[18:28:40] <electronplusplus> no
[18:28:54] <electronplusplus> in fact the documentation for jQuery UI is kind of silly
[18:29:00] <ajpiano> we know
[18:29:00] <geestring> can someone confirm that getHours() doesnt work in chrome?
[18:29:12] <ajpiano> we are trying to improve it as we prepare for 1.9
[18:29:17] <electronplusplus> geestring: pastebin
[18:29:21] <ajpiano> filing a bug about what you think is missing is a good way to help :)
[18:29:29] <electronplusplus> are you in the dev side?
[18:29:40] <ajpiano> i am dev rel lead for ui
[18:29:51] <electronplusplus> congratulations for the nice project :)
[18:29:59] <ajpiano> :)
[18:30:04] <gnarf> electronplusplus: with silly documentation
[18:30:05] <gnarf> ;)
[18:30:18] <electronplusplus> lool
[18:30:19] <matter> if the question is for me, yes I am on the dev side
[18:30:30] <electronplusplus> both lol
[18:30:41] <electronplusplus> btw what the next move in jQuery UI?
[18:30:59] <ajpiano> the next move is prerparing for 1.9
[18:31:10] <ajpiano> working on finalising tests and demos etc for the new widgets
[18:31:15] <ajpiano> improving docs etc
[18:31:25] <electronplusplus> nice :)
[18:31:41] <geestring> electronplusplus, it's just this: var event_date = new Date('2011-05-10T10:30:00-04:00');
[18:31:41] <geestring> alert(event_date.getHours());
[18:31:45] <gnarf> new effects / color
[18:31:46] <gnarf> ;)
[18:31:50] <gnarf> new widgets!
[18:31:53] <gnarf> better docs
[18:31:58] <geestring> works in firefox
[18:32:00] <electronplusplus> in the future jQuery could have something like Ext Designer :D
[18:32:09] <electronplusplus> but I think that's asking too much
[18:32:25] <ajpiano> i can confirm that it works in chrome, geestring
[18:32:42] <gnarf> geestring??? srsly?
[18:32:57] <geestring> waa?
[18:34:07] <matter> so, no one has a working example of a deep linking jquery script working with scroll to plugin....?
[18:34:26] <geestring> ok it must be something in the rest of my code that's not making it work in chrome
[18:34:52] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: I' ve a question about your life style :)
[18:34:54] <Javex> Hi! I'm using IIS with asp.net 4.0, jquery and PageMethods. Does anobody know how can I achieve ajax push (comet) with PageMethods? Feel free to point me at webpage. Thanks a lot :)
[18:34:57] <abjorn> electronplusplus: idk jQuery UI is more for individual widgets than an entire interface like Ext JS is, so I think a designer application would be inappropriate
[18:35:04] <ajpiano> electronplusplus: hmmm?
[18:35:20] <electronplusplus> How it's possible to someone be evolve in an open source project and pay the bills?
[18:35:22] <abjorn> I think he's hitting on you ajpiano!
[18:35:27] <abjorn> oh
[18:35:28] <abjorn> nvm
[18:35:30] <electronplusplus> fail
[18:35:41] <ajpiano> work for a company that lets you spend time on open source
[18:35:43] <abjorn> I thought it would be more interesting if you were hitting on him
[18:35:51] <njbair> how can I select the text within an element?
[18:36:08] <ajpiano> or have spare time
[18:36:12] <abjorn> or both
[18:36:16] <ajpiano> or a company that lets you slack ;)
[18:36:36] <abjorn> or be a freelancer and ANSWER TO NO MAN
[18:36:36] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: they let you spend time on open source?
[18:36:58] <electronplusplus> that's amazing
[18:37:13] <pifantastic> Open Source has a large ROI if you know what you're doing
[18:37:15] <ajpiano> yeup
[18:37:39] <abjorn> You'd be surprised, electronplusplus, more technology-oriented companies are more and more open to that.
[18:37:49] <electronplusplus> that's a new reality for me because I'm Portuguese ;)
[18:37:49] <abjorn> Hell, even Microsoft is getting...sort of...open to that.
[18:37:59] <abjorn> ..sort of
[18:38:13] <geestring> electronplusplus, so it works if I take it our and put it on its own, but here is the rest of my code... http://pastebin.com/6uyCUGR2
[18:38:16] <ajpiano> msft donates a fair bit of time and resources to jquery
[18:38:23] <abjorn> yeah
[18:38:29] <abjorn> although not a whole lot beyond that
[18:38:34] <abjorn> but that's still quite something
[18:39:13] <electronplusplus> geestring:   success: parseXml  input missing?
[18:39:37] <electronplusplus> or does it gets in by default?
[18:39:40] <abjorn> gnarf: well hell I can't find a single bug for jquery ui that I think I can work on
[18:39:46] <abjorn> so much for that
[18:40:25] <geestring> im doing a tutorial, and yes it executes and passes the results automatically
[18:40:34] <geestring> it works in firefox
[18:40:36] <abjorn> I suppose back to working on my own projects then. My CouchDB library needs auth support anyways
[18:41:20] <electronplusplus> geestring: don't you use the developers tools in chrome?
[18:41:30] <abjorn> chrome dev tools <3
[18:41:32] <electronplusplus> you'll save fuckloads of time
[18:41:55] <abjorn> I don't know how I got anything done before it :>
[18:42:04] <electronplusplus> abjorn: how it's possible to company make money with open source software?
[18:42:07] <geestring> ok, yea im new and always forget to turn to it.
[18:42:36] <pifantastic> electronplusplus: what do you think is happening when you build an app with jQuery and then charge your client for it?
[18:42:51] <geestring> ok, so it cannot load the .xml in the first place. "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."  is that an option in chrome?
[18:42:56] <electronplusplus> making money
[18:43:00] <pifantastic> :D
[18:43:07] <abjorn> Eh, there's different strategies, electronplusplus. What a lot of companies do is only focus some of their time and resources on open-source, and the rest on products and services that make them money.
[18:43:08] <electronplusplus> but the jQuery team doesn't receive a simple penny
[18:43:21] <pifantastic> geestring: you cant make cross domain ajax request
[18:43:24] <pifantastic> s
[18:43:35] <abjorn> And then there's some companies that make an open-source product but charge for official support (like several ecommerce solutions)
[18:43:41] <pifantastic> electronplusplus: but they all use jQuery to make money
[18:44:12] <electronplusplus> hmm
[18:44:18] <electronplusplus> they help open source to make money
[18:44:21] <electronplusplus> fair enough
[18:44:49] <geestring> right now im just using the sample.xml in the same directory as the .js file
[18:45:35] <pifantastic> ?p @ geestring
[18:45:36] <bot-t> geestring, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[18:46:05] <geestring> http://pastebin.com/6uyCUGR2
[18:47:21] <pifantastic> geestring: are you using Inspector/Firebug to inspect the results of the Ajax request?
[18:49:06] <geestring> i used the chrome tool. It's working fine in firefox
[18:49:27] <pifantastic> and what does the Ajax request/response look like?
[18:49:41] <jarred_> hi all, so I'm new to jQuery, but I have a dynamic list of stuff generated (via ERB), and I want to have an onclick event for each of them, but since they're dynamically generated I won't know the IDS
[18:49:44] <jarred_> ID's
[18:49:56] <jarred_> How do I reference them?
[18:50:22] <pifantastic> give them a class?
[18:50:33] <ajpiano> jarred_: you can use event delegation and catch the click on their container, here is a demo http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/v8U3W/
[18:50:34] <jarred_> Javascript has classes :O
[18:50:49] <ajpiano> jarred_: no, css does.
[18:50:54] <jarred_> oh
[18:50:59] <ajpiano> you can use other ways of selecting something besides it's ID
[18:51:03] <ajpiano> its*
[18:51:27] <jarred_> so something like a foreach of the <ul>'s children?
[18:51:47] <jarred_> oh wait
[18:51:49] <jarred_> I see how to do this
[18:51:49] <jarred_> nvm
[18:51:52] <ajpiano> not necessarily, you can .. ok
[18:52:27] <redeeman> if i use a selector that matches multiple items, should i do .each?
[18:53:00] <quuxman> how do I get the HTML of a jquery object, as oposed to just the HTML of the child elements?
[18:53:06] <ajpiano> redeeman, not necessarily
[18:53:25] <ajpiano> quuxman, you can use an outerHTML shim
[18:53:29] <ajpiano> ?g jquery outerhtml yelotofu
[18:53:29] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery: outerHTML | Yelotofu - http://yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[18:53:35] <ajpiano> it's not natively in jquery to do that
[18:53:48] <quuxman> grrr ;)
[18:54:12] <geestring> pifantastic, im not getting anything in my firebug console, no post or get.
[18:54:24] <midgetspy> how can I use selectors to get at something that's my parent's sibling? or should I use .parent() and then somehow select from there?
[18:54:25] <redeeman> ajpiano, how do i know when to use it?
[18:54:59] <ajpiano> when you need to do something to each of them that isn't handled by some jquery method that already iterates the entire collection implicitly
[18:55:16] <redeeman> oh so basically if im not using a plugin?
[18:55:24] <ajpiano> which most jquery setters do
[18:55:29] <ajpiano> no
[18:55:43] <ajpiano> $(".foo").click(function() { }); binds a handler to ALL .foo
[18:55:44] <redeeman> if im not doing something like .click or .fancybox etc
[18:55:45] <ajpiano> you don't have to do
[18:55:47] <redeeman> yeah okay
[18:55:50] <ajpiano> well
[18:56:08] <ajpiano> or .css("color","red) etc.
[18:58:04] <orolo> i need to pass in paramter "bat" into myFunction(foo, bar, bat){}. so how do i call myFunction(bat = "myvalue")?
[18:58:04] <redeeman> ajpiano, i believe i understand, thank you
[18:59:39] <coldhead> javascript is and will be a browser scripting language. sorry nodejs
[19:02:38] <N3w8ee> Hey jQuery UI when using themeroller says rounded edges are a css feature not supported in IE -- but it is now !
[19:03:25] <N3w8ee> but jQuery for president also !
[19:03:28] <geestring> after some research it looks like browsers don;t allow ajax requests to file://
[19:03:35] <geestring> for security reasons
[19:04:01] <N3w8ee> geestring, what about file:///
[19:04:06] <geestring> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4208530/xmlhttprequest-origin-null-is-not-allowed-access-control-access-allow-for-file
[19:04:13] <geestring> sorry, i meant that.
[19:04:29] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: gnarf  I have a question
[19:05:00] <electronplusplus> microsoft ie isn't interested in make javascript fast like google's V8
[19:05:17] <electronplusplus> do you think that silverlight will take over web apps?
[19:05:28] <ajpiano> huh no that's not true at all
[19:05:30] <blkcat> erm
[19:05:33] <blkcat> why on earth would it
[19:05:36] <blkcat> nobody uses silverlight
[19:05:36] <ajpiano> ms is all about trying to make fast JS with chakra
[19:05:48] <ajpiano> and even more so, how would ms's failure to make their JS faster
[19:06:10] <ajpiano> mean that their proprietary, low-penetration platform would somehow gain more marketshare
[19:06:14] <electronplusplus> simple reason
[19:06:23] <electronplusplus> they want silverlight to be .Net based
[19:06:38] <electronplusplus> and coders won't spend much time on learn to port to silverlight
[19:07:00] <electronplusplus> there are a lot of .net coders and I hate them all
[19:07:53] <N3w8ee> ajpiano, yes it is true you can see it under roll your own-> corner radius (here: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/.)
[19:08:10] <tecmo> i am .net coder before! orz
[19:08:30] <ajpiano> N3w8ee: huh, what are you on about?
[19:09:06] <ajpiano> the copy is a little outdated, that doesn't change the fact that border radius in css3 doesn't work in ie6-ie8
[19:09:13] <ajpiano> i'm sure we'll update the copy in due time
[19:09:24] <ajpiano> you can file a ticket if you want
[19:10:00] <N3w8ee> ok, thanks
[19:10:08] <snover> electronplusplus: you’re spouting nonsense, you do realise that, right?
[19:10:24] <electronplusplus> hmm no
[19:10:57] <snover> well, consider this notification then. :)
[19:12:00] <electronplusplus> snover: waist 1 minute of your life explaining me why :)
[19:12:19] <N3w8ee> but IS corner radius really supported in IE9? Seems by default you can round the edges but not set the radius?
[19:12:30] <snover> electronplusplus: ajpiano already just did. also you’re looking for the word “waste”.
[19:13:51] <ajpiano> N3w8ee: i'm not entirely sure of the distinction you're making?
[19:14:29] <RomD> is there a way to make .load() use GET when passing parameters?
[19:15:34] <reli> hi
[19:15:35] <ajpiano> RomD $("#foo").load("url.php?"+ $.param(data) );
[19:16:03] <RomD> ajpiano: thanks
[19:16:08] <ajpiano> that should do the trick,
[19:16:20] <electronplusplus> snover: but silverlight is good and if they fail in making JS fast, it wouldn't mean a failure to silverlight
[19:16:48] <N3w8ee> ajpiano I sorry I was saying that ie9 does round edges but I was not sure it supported a user-specified radius value.
[19:17:21] <snover> electronplusplus: It is unclear to me at this point that you are actually aware of the concepts in the sentences that you are typing
[19:17:29] <reli> I am trying to get some content from a different page with ajax, I am trying to filter the result I get back so that I only display what I need. this is the code http://jsfiddle.net/8DWqm/1/
[19:17:47] <RomD> electronplusplus: microsoft pretty much gave up on trying to make silverlight a web standard. they concentrate on html5 on the web now and use silverlight for mobile development
[19:18:14] <electronplusplus> huh, gave up?
[19:19:28] <RomD> http://mashable.com/2010/10/29/microsoft-silverlgiht-html/
[19:19:35] <RomD> first link I could dig up
[19:19:58] <electronplusplus> damn
[19:20:04] <electronplusplus> I was aware of that
[19:21:01] <snover> electronplusplus: ok, at this point I am certain you are not paying attention to the words you are typing
[19:21:44] <electronplusplus> snover: you speak like shakespeare
[19:22:02] <ajpiano> lol
[19:22:05] <snover> in that case I’m also certain you have never read shakespeare
[19:22:10] <electronplusplus> or confucius
[19:22:32] <jarred_> How would I get every <li> and their ID, and on click launch a function called SetupAssignment that takes the <li>'s ID?
[19:22:40] <jarred_> I know it'd probably look something like
[19:22:41] <jarred_> https://gist.github.com/988040
[19:23:17] <ajpiano> $("li[id]").click(function(e) { SetupAssignment(this.id);    });
[19:23:36] <electronplusplus> snover: you're the chinese -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7luMp6lb9M
[19:25:42] <jarred_> ajpiano, thanks
[19:25:57] <tecmo> $("li").click(function() { SetupAssignment( $(this).attr("id") ); });
[19:37:37] <bananasontoast> Hey guys, can anyone possibly tell me why my click function isn't working here? --> http://jsfiddle.net/mitchmalone/tu8r3/
[19:39:44] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: date for the 1.9 release?
[19:39:57] <ajpiano> unclear as yet
[19:40:35] <abjorn> oh my god why am I so lazy today
[19:41:08] <electronplusplus> abjorn: electronic music solves the problem :)
[19:41:39] <abjorn> nahhh imma stick with Tool
[19:47:35] <m0dmd> abjorn wtf is going on man
[19:48:17] <m0dmd> no wigglin today :(
[19:49:00] <redeeman> $(this).closest("form").find('input[type=checkbox]').attr( 'checked', true ); <-- this does not seem to check anything, what might i be doing wrong?
[19:51:49] <psilo2> redeeman: html attributes are string values, try "checked".
[19:52:27] <redeeman> didnt change anything
[19:52:50] <abjorn> hey m0dmd
[19:52:52] * abjorn wiggles
[19:52:57] <m0dmd> what's going on pal
[19:53:00] <m0dmd> hope you're well man.
[19:53:05] <abjorn> im
[19:53:06] <abjorn> lazy
[19:53:07] <abjorn> haha
[19:53:10] <abjorn> being lazy
[19:53:21] <m0dmd> maybe you need to be lazy today :)
[19:54:44] <tecmo> redeeman: are you using jquery 1.6?
[19:54:55] <redeeman> 1.5.2 i believe
[19:54:58] <redeeman> i can upgrade if needed
[19:55:27] <m0dmd> upgrading is as easy as using a cdn!
[19:55:36] <redeeman> i dont use a cdn though
[19:55:41] <redeeman> but i can just drop a new file in :P
[19:55:58] <fructose> I have a document.ready function that runs over different sections of a page (using .each()) to format it. However, the consequence is there is huge lag time before that. Is there a way to force javascript to apply visual changes before the script is complete?
[19:56:19] <abjorn> I feel like playing stalker...need to install it again
[19:56:29] <m0dmd> play make money!
[19:56:31] <m0dmd> ahha
[19:56:49] <redeeman> tecmo, does it make a difference?
[19:56:50] <abjorn> I would but...so lazy
[20:00:37] <abjorn> http://www.speedtest.net/result/807839174.png oh dear lord, poor capetown
[20:29:50] <m0dmd> abjorn you there
[20:30:49] <abjorn> yep
[20:32:04] <abjorn> sup m0dmd
[20:33:42] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[20:33:47] <abjorn> yo wkmanire
[20:33:51] * abjorn wiggles
[20:34:02] <wkmanire> he he
[20:34:10] <m0dmd> sup wkmanire
[20:34:14] <wkmanire> Ok, Mooz' js2-mode is awesome!
[20:34:20] <m0dmd> yo abjorn i wanted you to check something out for me really quick
[20:34:24] <abjorn> sure
[20:34:24] <wkmanire> The one coldhead found.
[20:34:27] <m0dmd> and let me know your thoughts as per the coding
[20:34:44] <m0dmd> it's all functioning fast but wanted your input
[20:34:53] <m0dmd> http://rhythms.2urnitup.com/fb
[20:35:54] <CuDi> WATUP HOMIES
[20:35:57] <CuDi> cudi in the house
[20:36:09] <wkmanire> #house
[20:36:14] <CuDi> sup witit
[20:36:16] <CuDi> yo listen
[20:36:26] <m0dmd> whatup CuDi
[20:36:27] <CuDi> is it possible to set the HREF of a link on click, and then proceed with the click event
[20:36:37] <m0dmd> CuDi why not
[20:36:39] <m0dmd> :)
[20:36:52] <abjorn> Well, m0dmd, other than some inline styles and inline javascript (as well as the lack of only one var statement in the document.load function) it looks fine to me
[20:36:54] <CuDi> yea how do i pause the click event till i'm finished setting the href
[20:37:50] <wkmanire> CuDi: No need to pause it. Just handle the click even and change the window location.
[20:38:03] <CuDi> you sure
[20:38:08] <wkmanire> Fo shizzle
[20:38:12] <m0dmd> Yes I agwee
[20:38:21] <m0dmd> with a lil wiggle on the site
[20:38:22] <CuDi> so if i add a function to the click event, that function will fire before the actual click is fired
[20:38:33] <CuDi> actually the problem with that is, my function needs to do an AJAX call
[20:38:38] <wkmanire> Thats ok.
[20:38:39] <CuDi> so i should make my ajax call asynchronous
[20:38:45] <wkmanire> Yes.
[20:38:54] <CuDi> baaaaaaaaam
[20:38:55] <abjorn> ya it needs more wiggle m0dmd
[20:38:56] <CuDi> alrite lets try this
[20:39:17] <m0dmd> what's what I think i'm missin abjorn!
[20:39:19] <m0dmd> rofl
[20:39:29] <wkmanire> $('#anchor').click(function () { $.get('something', function () { window.location="gohere.html" }}); });
[20:39:31] <wkmanire> or something like that
[20:39:38] <CuDi> i dont want to use window.location
[20:39:43] <CuDi> i had issues with that in IE7
[20:39:56] <abjorn> window.location = "fuckie7.com";
[20:40:10] <CuDi> lol
[20:40:35] <m0dmd> rofl
[20:41:47] <wkmanire> CuDi: I think you can change the href of the anchor and return true from the click event.
[20:42:11] <wkmanire> but doing that with an async ajax call is not going to be easy.
[20:42:13] <CuDi> yea thats what im tryna do
[20:42:16] <CuDi> yea exactly
[20:42:57] <wkmanire> hmm, what happens when you call $('#myAnchor').click() without first giving it a click handler?
[20:42:59] <wkmanire> Does it navigate?
[20:43:26] <wkmanire> If it does, then we can do the ajax call on click, then swap out the click event on the anchor then trigger the click on the anchor.
[20:44:02] <wkmanire> Or something to that effect
[20:44:10] <wkmanire> but honestly, setting window.location should be sufficient.
[20:45:18] <wkmanire> I'm gonna go run on my gopher wheel. I'll be back in a bit.
[20:45:21] * wkmanire nick wkmanire_
[20:46:13] <CuDi> great my ajax function doesnt have an syncrhonous option
[20:46:27] <CuDi> ill try window.location hangon
[20:49:11] <wkmanire> CuDi: synchronous ajax is a bad idea. What if something goes wrong at the server? Your script could cause the browser to hang.
[20:49:31] <snover> not can, will
[20:50:28] <CuDi> hm
[20:50:36] <CuDi> what are my options then lol
[20:50:50] <CuDi> i think the reason we didnt use window.location was for IE7 it was causing the Url to actually change
[20:50:55] <CuDi> instead of just launching a download prompt and staying on the same page
[20:52:28] <wkmanire> Why do you need to wait until the link is clicked in order to change the href?
[20:52:51] <wkmanire> Is there any way you can do it before then?
[20:53:22] <wkmanire> I imagine you are providing a download based on some settings in the page the user adjusts?
[20:54:41] <wkmanire> Ok, I'm really going now. be back soon.
[20:57:10] <CuDi> forget it im using window.lolcation
[20:58:57] <mackry> What would be the best way to have toggle a .delegate() binding on and off?
[20:59:16] <mackry> to toggle*
[20:59:28] <goldenwest> ?toggle @mockry
[20:59:29] <bot-t> mockry, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[21:02:39] <mackry> goldenwest: so, would I delegate in the first toggle, then undelegate in the second handler?
[21:03:37] <ngharo> you can try unbind(), but i'm not sure that'll work with delegate or not
[21:03:59] <mackry> undelegate works for unbinding a delegate
[21:04:25] <ngharo> oh neato
[21:04:30] <ngharo> new method i was not aware of
[21:04:41] <atan> I want to insert an image into the bottom of another div when someone clicks my link. I have $("a.two").click().append(''); now but, err, I'm missing something totally here. <div class="images"><img /><img /><img /><img /></div> I want to add another image to the bottom of those suckers.
[21:05:02] <quizme> i'm drawing hexagons in a canvas element
[21:05:22] <quizme> anybody have an idea how to detect click events for a particualr hexagon ?
[21:05:33] <ngharo> mackry: it might be easier to just use a *gasp* global variable to set active or not
[21:06:01] <mackry> ngharo: exactly what I was just doing! thanks :)
[21:06:28] <ngharo> :)
[21:09:07] <atan> Ahh got it. Good now. Thanks anyway guys! :D
[21:23:51] <reli> hi can someone help me figure out why when I try to use .filter() after an ajax request it does not work, unless the div i am requesting is right after the body tag
[21:24:19] <Brodingo> reli paste your code
[21:24:27] <reli> this is the code http://jsfiddle.net/8DWqm/1/
[21:24:49] <reli> the html is bigger, but that is all valid
[21:25:10] <Brodingo> think you might want .find() instead of filter()
[21:26:55] <reli> i'll try that
[21:27:40] <sunscreen> vk
[21:27:55] <sunscreen> how can i change the style sheet color to a random color
[21:28:03] <reli> why did that work :)
[21:28:10] <Jester831> will jquery properly handle data attributes in older browsers?
[21:28:18] <reli> thanks btw
[21:28:54] <sunscreen> and cna i use jquery to set the backgroung image of a div
[21:29:01] <Brodingo> Jester831 yes
[21:29:10] <sunscreen> when I do with my css it makes the div transparent
[21:29:19] <Brodingo> sunscreen yes, preferably with add/remove class and not .css()
[21:29:46] <Jester831> Brodingo: Do I need to do it via attributes or does .data do that as well?
[21:30:07] <Brodingo> any data attributes will automagically work with .data()
[21:30:54] <Jester831> solid
[21:31:01] <Jester831> thanks
[21:31:11] <Brodingo> of course check the docs for exact usage
[21:31:12] <Brodingo> ?data
[21:31:13] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[21:31:14] <Murugaratham> any1 can help me with this; http://pastebin.com/abuBn25e
[21:31:32] <Murugaratham> im getting obj[0] undefined..
[21:32:34] <snover> that could be because obj[0] is undefined.
[21:32:54] <Murugaratham> when i run it in ff4, i can use the json viewer to see the obj
[21:33:06] <Murugaratham> it's an array with 2 objects inside
[21:34:22] <reli> Brodingo is it posible to find() two classes? something like this:
[21:34:26] <reli> var oneval = $response.find('.grid_8').find('.shut');
[21:35:00] <ajpiano> .find(".foo,.bar")
[21:35:08] <Brodingo> yes, but that is kind of redundant, but you might mean .find('.grid_8.shut')
[21:35:14] <Brodingo> or that
[21:36:17] <reli> what do you mean my redundant
[21:36:52] <ajpiano> the first one you posted won't work
[21:37:02] <ajpiano> cause it will try to find all the shut inside of grid_8
[21:38:11] <Murugaratham> it's ok, i've fixed it
[21:39:19] <reli> a ok I get what you mean , but yes  I wanted the one yous gave me - thanks
[21:43:05] <geestring> is there a way to get the contents of an xml file without using ajax? all the examples are using .Get ajax which won't work on a local file
[21:44:29] <K1ng> no you cant get it without ajax
[21:45:51] <geestring> I can't load it initially?
[21:46:25] <necromancer> you can load a local file through ajax dude
[21:46:26] <necromancer> :)
[21:46:42] <K1ng> nope
[21:46:59] <geestring> i've been seeing these posts all over the internet
[21:47:00] <geestring> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3397644/jquery-running-ajax-locally-without-a-webserver
[21:47:03] <necromancer> K1ng: you talkin about local as in on the same http server, or local as in on my computer?
[21:47:12] <K1ng> file:// is blocked
[21:47:19] <necromancer> actually i guess that's directed toward geestring
[21:47:20] <geestring> yea that's what im trying to do
[21:47:23] <necromancer> oh shit
[21:47:26] <necromancer> nah you can't do that really
[21:47:41] <necromancer> what you can do is allow uploading of an XML file through PHP, and parse that
[21:47:51] <wkmanire> I'm back
[21:48:11] <geestring> isi wanted to see if I could do it without using a webserver.
[21:48:12] <reli> is there any posible way to keep the ajax content even if the user has refreshed the page? and is that something that would be seen as an important feature in a site
[21:48:35] <wkmanire> geestring: You can if you --disable-web-security in chrome
[21:48:43] <wkmanire> Run chrome from the command line with that argument.
[21:48:52] <wkmanire> This is not a viable solution for a public product however.
[21:48:56] <necromancer> yeah haha
[21:49:15] <necromancer> geestring: you might be able to use HTML5 web storage in the future :)
[21:49:36] <geestring> I guess the easiest solution is to use a local web server ?
[21:49:43] <K1ng> what is html5 web storage?
[21:49:44] <necromancer> oh yeah definitely
[21:49:50] <wkmanire> geestring: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[21:49:55] <necromancer> http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/
[21:49:57] <wkmanire> geestring: From your linux terminal
[21:50:11] <necromancer> yeah you could also use python or ruby
[21:50:32] <K1ng> you got to be kidding me
[21:50:32] <wkmanire> It will serve static files from localhost on port 8000 (default) or whatever you choose.
[21:50:42] <K1ng> zip file in html?
[21:50:56] <geestring> this is for a lobby display screen. I think they already have an windows IIS webserver running.
[21:51:10] <wkmanire> geestring: You'll need to upgrade them to linux
[21:51:11] <necromancer> who said anything about zip files K1ng?
[21:51:14] <wkmanire> or download python onto the server.
[21:51:19] <geestring> why?
[21:51:28] <K1ng> just for example
[21:51:30] * wkmanire is being silly.
[21:51:34] <geestring> ok ;)
[21:51:37] <wkmanire> geestring: Just park your files on the webserver.
[21:51:52] <wkmanire> make an IIS site and put your xml files on it like you would anything else.
[21:52:22] <necromancer> K1ng: it's just a key/value pair system like redis or something
[21:52:52] <necromancer> i don't think it would be a viable means of storing binaries of any kind
[21:56:33] <wkmanire> I wish borders would stop trying to save me money and just send me some.
[21:56:43] <wkmanire> These daily spam messages are starting to get ridiculous.
[21:57:28] <geestring> im looking at these old javascript xml tutorials, and they're using a .load() function for xml files. Is that using Ajax as well?
[21:57:48] <Tant102> geestring, could you show us the complete call?
[21:58:24] <wkmanire> geestring: .load will put the xml right into another element.
[21:58:44] <wkmanire> geestring: What are you aiming to do with the XML data exactly?
[21:59:16] <geestring> just parse it and display it, but the key is that the file won't be online
[21:59:55] <geestring> this is the function that handles the loading..http://pastebin.com/uHautmnz
[22:00:09] <geestring> i found it online... just curious what they are doing.
[22:01:19] <geestring> looks like it's only for internet explorer?
[22:01:40] <wkmanire> yeah
[22:02:46] <cygnus_> Is there an effect in jquery where it fades the main screen like dark and makes it non clickable then I can put another window on top like displaying an image?
[22:03:25] <lijzz> u can use a model
[22:03:40] <cygnus_> what is that?
[22:03:50] <abjorn> bot-t: tell Brodingo I'm stalking him on twitter
[22:03:50] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[22:03:53] <lijzz> google it for a modal popup
[22:03:55] <jonee> looks like a lighthouse
[22:04:06] <cygnus_> thanks
[22:04:14] <bot-t> cygnus_, There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[22:04:26] <m0dmd> abjorn
[22:04:32] <abjorn> Sometimes I wonder if bot-t is sentient
[22:04:39] <abjorn> m0dmd

[22:12:13] <abjorn> oh my it is
[22:12:23] <abjorn> and it's...a legitimate website
[22:12:31] <abjorn> apparently it's twitter for anti-social people

[22:13:13] <abjorn> so, yeah, twitter for twats
[22:13:20] <m0dmd> perfect color I hate it already.
[22:13:34] <m0dmd> bashed in the face with a tampon

[22:19:35] <bot-t> wkmanire, Create a live-update list effect with jQuery | WebGurus Design Blog - http://www.webgurusdesignblog.com/2009/02/creating-a-live-update-list-effect-with-jquery/comment-page-3/
[22:22:53] <coldhead> will there ever be a rainbow?
[22:23:26] <ajpiano> are you asking about the future of gay rights or just the lame weather thing
[22:23:28] <mackry> Anyway to replace only inner text? Ex: <div>Hi there<img src="h.png" /></div> I want to only replace the "Hi there". I tried .text() but it replaces the html <img> tag as well.
[22:23:53] <coldhead> either, aj
[22:24:06] <coldhead> they're both great
[22:25:09] <coldhead> mackry: can you just wrap the bare text in something in the first place?
[22:25:17] <abjorn> No to both, coldhead.
[22:25:18] <coldhead> that saves everyone a lot of trouble
[22:25:20] <wkmanire> mackry: Otherwise you'll probably have to drop down the native DOM.
[22:25:39] <wkmanire> and search for the first text node child of that div.
[22:25:49] <wkmanire> down to the*
[22:26:04] <coldhead> i got a lot more beer, wkmanire, so if you need me to solve any more headaches for you...
[22:26:06] <mackry> coldhead: not sure what you mean by wrap the bare text
[22:26:29] <coldhead> <span>hi there</span>
[22:26:37] <wkmanire> coldhead: I ran out of Sam Adams last night, All I have left is Tecate... which is kind of like soda.
[22:26:40] <mackry> wkmanire: didn't see your first response
[22:26:46] <coldhead> if you want to manipulate elements it's easiest if they are elements
[22:27:10] <mackry> coldhead: I want to keep the img tag, but change the text. I can't add any elements.
[22:27:19] <wkmanire> $('#theDiv')[0].childNodes[0] should be the textNode "Hi there"
[22:27:34] <wkmanire> But that can change if you mess with the formatting of your DOM.
[22:27:53] <wkmanire> Best not to fiddle with that and just wrap important things in elements that have IDs.
[22:28:30] <coldhead> var $kids = $('div *'); $('div').text('lol'); $('div').append($kids);
[22:28:42] <coldhead> so gross
[22:29:21] <wkmanire> coldhead: At least that won't break because of re-indenting the markup.
[22:29:48] <coldhead> and it saves you from non-jQuery
[22:30:50] <mackry> coldhead: That'll just reinsert what was in it originally
[22:31:04] <coldhead> you think?
[22:31:11] <coldhead> let's see whatjsfiddle says
[22:31:16] <mackry> :O
[22:31:25] <coldhead> sorry if i'm wrong, it's my first day using jQuery
[22:31:35] * wkmanire facepalms.
[22:31:52] <m0dmd> heh
[22:32:21] <m0dmd> good luck coldhead, you'll be the best jQuery programmer in one day.
[22:32:28] <m0dmd> guaranteed!
[22:32:32] <wkmanire> ajpiano: We started using the grid
[22:32:40] <m0dmd> Daylight come and me won go home!
[22:32:54] <ajpiano> wkmanire: oh really??
[22:32:58] <wkmanire> ajpiano: We had to add some features to it but my boss is ready to replace our commercial one.
[22:33:01] <ajpiano> i haven't even really done anything with it
[22:33:03] <ajpiano> that's awesome
[22:33:12] <coldhead> mackry: http://jsfiddle.net/mbTwT/
[22:33:13] <ajpiano> it's not even like, finished yet
[22:33:15] <wkmanire> We added excel like field nav.
[22:33:20] <coldhead> i am right
[22:33:29] <coldhead> IN YOUR FACE, EVERYONE WHO EVER DOUBTED ME
[22:33:37] <wkmanire> so you can shift tab, tab, shift enter and enter to put different fields into "edit" mode which we also added.
[22:33:50] <wkmanire> The datasource idea was neat by the awy.
[22:33:51] <wkmanire> way*
[22:33:51] <m0dmd> rofl
[22:34:00] <mackry> coldhead: hahahaha
[22:34:06] <ajpiano> it's still influx as to how it will be done
[22:34:15] <wkmanire> I liked that concept a lot.
[22:34:31] <mackry> thanks mate,  i'll give it a try now.
[22:34:42] <coldhead> good luck mackry
[22:34:43] <wkmanire> One gotcha is how the datasource paginates.
[22:34:47] <coldhead> stay strong
[22:34:49] <wkmanire> it copies one page of data from the original array
[22:35:02] <wkmanire> so if you change the data from the paged set in the datasource it isn't actually getting applied to your model.
[22:35:19] <ajpiano> you should defintely pass that stuff along
[22:35:21] <wkmanire> But we worked around that easily enough.
[22:35:36] <ajpiano> there are irc meetings for grid and also the wiki
[22:35:56] <robmiller_> does anyone know if the fancybox plugin is noconflict compatible?  Is there an easy way to tell among all plugins?
[22:35:59] <ajpiano> i haven't had a lot of opportunity to kick the tires
[22:36:19] <wkmanire> The basic grid is nice. The design is flexible enough that you can just take it and run with it.
[22:36:47] <wkmanire> To be honest, I'd like to see the various features I mentioned made available as seperate plugins that you sort of layer onto the table.
[22:36:53] <wkmanire> That way you an keep it as basic as you please.
[22:37:00] <ajpiano> that's kind of the idea
[22:37:08] <ajpiano> is that you don't have pagination or any of these other crazy things on by default
[22:37:25] <wkmanire> Which is what all of the commerical widgets do (that we've tried)
[22:37:30] <wkmanire> and it nearly always becomes a fight.
[22:39:10] <wkmanire> ajpiano: I'm sure they've already discussed this stuff in the dev meetings though right?
[22:39:17] <ajpiano> yes
[22:39:31] <ajpiano> but still a lot is being worked on, or needs active help ;)
[22:40:54] <wkmanire> I'll make our modifications available then. Maybe some of our stuff can be cherry picked.
[22:41:49] <ajpiano> sounds good
[22:49:31] <wkmanire> ajpiano: I feel dumb for asking this but, what channel do they hold those meetings in?
[22:49:35] <wkmanire> jqueryui-dev?
[22:49:49] <ajpiano> we have them in #jquery-meeting on wednesdays at 12est for jquery ui, and then 1pm grid
[22:49:56] <ajpiano> and jqueryui-dev is always there
[22:49:59] <ajpiano> if you have questions about anything
[22:50:00] <ajpiano> ever
[22:50:52] <mahen23> guys
[22:51:02] <mahen23> anyone can confirm if they can access: http://music.mobilemru.com/
[22:51:17] <Renacor> anybody here use highcharts?
[22:51:23] <mahen23> apparently the Netherlands cannot access it
[22:51:43] <dr0id> Renacor: what about it ?
[22:51:58] <wkmanire> mahen23: I can access it.
[22:51:58] <Renacor> dr0id: do you know a way to use the pie graph with absolute values?
[22:52:14] <dr0id> hmm, nope. my team mate integrated it to the software, heh :P
[22:52:20] <Renacor> dr0id: It seems the pie chart only gets drawn if I specify values that equal to 100%
[22:52:24] <wkmanire> ajpiano: Thanks.
[22:52:33] <ajpiano> no problem, glad you asked
[22:52:48] <Renacor> dr0id: in your project do you use percentages or absolute values in the pie chart?
[22:54:59] <dr0id> absolute
[22:55:10] <dr0id> heh (asked my team mate) :P
[22:55:41] <mackry> coldhead: works great, thanks again.
[22:56:14] <Renacor> figured it out i think
[22:56:17] <Renacor> stacking: 'normal'
[22:56:54] <Renacor> nm
[23:02:15] <progrock> can anyone help me fix the black box, it should be in the top left: http://www.bobmonteverde.com/
[23:02:26] <progrock> even the computed styles seem correct
[23:04:03] <goldenwest> progrock your problem is margin auto
[23:04:20] <goldenwest> line 71 of style1.css
[23:05:34] <progrock> hahaha, nice find, thank you
[23:06:14] <progrock> definitely not my night that I missed that one
[23:09:59] <progrock> still think I;'m having a random issue with 'FOUT' due to measurements I'm taking... but sems odd since I used google font loader in order to have a callback for when the font IS done loading to start my code
[23:10:18] <khurram> hi all
[23:10:33] <khurram> can anyone please check why this ajax is not working ? http://jsfiddle.net/7SWka/
[23:10:58] <progrock> Maybe I'm just not noticing somewhere calcualting a string width on load, instead of lazily when the function is called
[23:11:11] <goldenwest> khurram - define not working
[23:11:30] <khurram> some how the data is comming as an empty string
[23:11:56] <mipo> hi
[23:12:13] <khurram> doldenwest: the request goes to the file with the proper parameter and i am only doing echo 'ok'; in the file to get the response back but in the successfunction its not showing any thing
[23:12:15] <mipo> when I use .load() , for loading a page in my div
[23:12:24] <mipo> that page have ckeditor
[23:12:39] <mipo> but when I load tha page, I have not editor
[23:13:12] <wkmanire> mipo: Do you have a live link?
[23:13:28] <gnarf> ajpiano: i have a question... If you drink bears, can you jQuery from a database?
[23:13:30] <mipo> wkmanire, what do you mean?
[23:13:41] <wkmanire> mipo: can I see the page?
[23:14:05] <ajpiano> its true, requires a family of bears to jaquery form your db
[23:14:08] <mipo> wkmanire,  that;s in my localhost
[23:14:42] <wkmanire> mipo: From your problem description I can only guess at what may be causing it. What have you done so far to debug the problem?
[23:15:07] * wkmanire thinks that if you can drink a bear, you can do whatever you want.
[23:16:40] <mipo> wkmanire, you want description?
[23:17:15] <mipo> wkmanire, My problem is solved!
[23:17:26] <wkmanire> mipo: Cool
[23:17:28] <mipo> wkmanire, thanks!
[23:17:41] <reli> should this work
[23:17:48] <reli> var anchor = $(this).attr("href")
[23:17:49] <goldenwest> khurram looks right to me - could you paste the PHP?
[23:17:50] <reli> 	if( $("anchor:contains('demo')") == true)
[23:18:13] <goldenwest> khurram - i apologize... you're missing a } at the end of your success function
[23:18:19] <wkmanire> reli: no.
[23:18:48] <wkmanire> reli: anchor is not accessible inside of that string literal.
[23:19:01] <khurram> sorry i figured it out and i have corrected it thankx for having a look it was the href= redirecting the page after the ajax finishing  but now its working ok
[23:19:17] <khurram> i am getting errors on debug(data) what is the right function ?
[23:19:25] <khurram> data.debug();
[23:19:42] <reli> wkmanire Am I close to the right thing
[23:19:46] <wkmanire> if (~anchor.indexOf('demo')) { /* do something */}
[23:20:08] <goldenwest> khurram if you just console.log the variable you should be able to expand it
[23:20:19] <goldenwest> console.log(data);
[23:20:20] <reli> what is indexOf
[23:20:21] <wkmanire> or more explicitly if (anchor.indexOf('demo') !== -1) { /* do something */ }
[23:20:32] <wkmanire> ?string.indexOf
[23:20:34] <bot-t> wkmanire, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[23:20:37] <wkmanire> hmm
[23:20:45] <wkmanire> reli: indexOf is a native method of the String object.
[23:20:56] <khurram> is there any function in javascript like  var_dump or print_r in php
[23:21:02] <wkmanire> reli: It returns the first occurance of a string contained inside of another string or it returns -1 if the string is not found.
[23:21:36] <wkmanire> by first occurance I mean to say the index of the first letter of the first occurance.
[23:21:43] <reli> cool I like it
[23:23:12] <khurram> is there any firefox addon for quick javascript functions and help ?
[23:23:25] <wkmanire> bot-t: How could you get that wrong? I am so disappointed.
[23:23:26] <bot-t> wkmanire, You may rely on it.
[23:23:33] <reli> needless to say it works :) thanks a lot
