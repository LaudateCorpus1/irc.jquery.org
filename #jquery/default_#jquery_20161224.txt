[07:28:06] <Duikb00t> Hello.
[07:28:40] <Duikb00t> Im still struggling with a good way to make columns scroll infinite, so the first item shows up after the last one.
[07:28:47] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/n8r0curL/  ><
[07:36:39] <Duikb00t> * https://jsfiddle.net/n8r0curL/1/ so far
[09:47:23] <Duikb00t> o/
[09:48:04] <Duikb00t> MassDebates: o/
[09:59:51] <shoky> Duikb00t: like this? https://jsfiddle.net/n8r0curL/4/
[10:00:13] <Duikb00t> omg
[10:00:37] <Duikb00t> Im unsure about performance but yes that's what I am looking for shoky, thank you.
[10:00:51] <Duikb00t> http://demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#gallery-photo-214  this kind of scrolling is what Im looking for
[10:01:09] <Duikb00t> unsure about what's happening in the background because. adding more and more and more and more.. data isn't maybe the best to do?
[10:01:28] <shoky> i doubt they add more and more ;p
[10:01:47] <Duikb00t> eh? :D
[10:03:10] <shoky> if you look at the elements inspector while scrolling you'll see they just update all the elements' transform: translate(...)  css
[10:04:38] <Duikb00t> shoky:  omg
[10:04:52] <Duikb00t> Computer says no: bam everything was gone and computer rebooted.
[10:05:08] <shoky> great computer

[10:05:52] <Duikb00t> mbp
[10:06:07] <shoky> sry
[10:06:48] <Duikb00t> :d
[10:07:06] <Duikb00t> what do you think about what I currently have and what should become that url ive send?
[10:07:18] <Duikb00t> http://demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#
[10:08:13] <shoky> donno if you got my msg before:  <shoky> if you look at the elements inspector while scrolling you'll see they just update all the elements' transform: translate(...)  css
[10:08:32] <Duikb00t> Yes indeed
[10:08:38] <Duikb00t> ( No had not received it )
[10:08:51] <Duikb00t> How would they do that ?
[10:09:06] <Duikb00t> I mean I understand transitions but not the way you scroll and 'repeat' them.
[10:09:19] <shoky> this isn't transitions, it's transform
[10:09:41] <shoky> anyway it's not a trivial thing to do, takes some work..
[10:10:07] <Duikb00t> hmm ok
[10:10:17] <shoky> and you 'repeat' them by taking the first and putting it as last, when scrolling, etc..
[10:10:18] <Duikb00t> What do you think about the fiddle approach?  Good?
[10:10:23] <Duikb00t> yes indeed
[10:10:23] <shoky> nope ;]
[10:10:29] <Duikb00t> meh :s
[10:13:34] <Duikb00t> Suggestion on how to fix it?
[10:14:53] <shoky> as i said, it's not trivial to do - a simple suggestion won't do it :P
[10:15:16] <shoky> so no, i have no suggestions sorry.. maybe if i'm bored later i'll try to do it
[10:16:18] <shoky> assuming you're still here ;]
[10:18:39] <Duikb00t> yes
[10:18:41] <Duikb00t> thanks :D
[10:18:42] <Duikb00t> haha
[10:19:00] <Duikb00t> I was looking maybe instead of jquery reactjs could help me better with this functionality
[10:19:02] <Duikb00t> not sure
[10:44:20] <nsanden> im using this emoji wysiwyg and it seems to transform a <textarea> into a content editable div. when i write in the div (or add emojis), then leave focus of the div, it updates a hidden textarea so i can submit the form
[10:44:52] <nsanden> pretty sure thats how it works anyway - here it is https://jsfiddle.net/1v03Lqnu/
[10:45:18] <nsanden> my issue is, i really want to update that hidden textarea after each keypress, instead of when it loses focus
[10:45:49] <nsanden> preferably id like to do it outside of the emoji plugin code, so i dont have to edit their file
[10:46:45] <nsanden> really appreciate if someone can point me in right direction there
[11:28:59] <nsanden> phew figured it out
[13:01:30] <snowkidind> is there a go-to jquery plugin that is pretty good at responsive type drill-down web app-ish menu animations etc with
[13:02:15] <snowkidind> like if I wanted to make an iOS looking drill down app
[14:55:15] <momomo> anyone know why when loading scripts from the head inside the index file such as scripts, styles ... the cache is not as sticky as when you later load it using xmhlttprequest .. when I hit refresh in the browser, all resources are retrieved from browser cache, but not those declared in index.html head ...
[17:03:28] <physikoi> Hello #jquery! I'm looking for a succinct explanation on how to choose the Correct plugin design pattern. Could someone point me in the right direction? Thanks
