[00:28:58] <melkor> I have some entities, ie user/date/content Currently they are in a table. I want to switch that so that only one is display, and I can navigate that. What is a good way to store the elements?
[01:18:34] <melkor> I got a jquery object with $('#someId'), now I want all of the div elements out of that with class='someClass' is there a good way to do this?
[01:20:25] <sacho> "out of that"?
[01:21:56] <melkor> <div id="someId"><div class="someClass">one</div><div class="someClass">two</div>
[01:22:28] <melkor> So in that instance I would like an array/jquery object with the two divs.
[01:23:41] <sacho> use find
[01:24:49] <jillesme> melkor: var stack = []; $('#someId div').each(stack.push($(this));
[01:26:24] <jillesme> Something like that, haven't tested that code or anything
[01:28:20] <jillesme> melkor: Or maybe $('#someId').children().each( ... );
[01:29:05] <sacho> or...$('#someId').find('.someClass') or >.someClass or $('#someId .someClass') or $('#someId>.someClass')...
[01:30:45] <jillesme> So many solutions
[01:31:34] <melkor> I tried "#someId.someClass" but that didn't work. I suppose I need the space in between. I switched to the .find() which worked.
[01:32:38] <sacho> melkor, do you know why it didn't work?
[01:34:16] <melkor> I can guess, because one looks for a elem with id and class of the corresponding values. The other looks for one then the next.
[01:35:24] <rindolf> Hi all.
[01:35:35] <sacho> the space specifies "descendants of"(the previous selector)
[01:35:45] <sacho> similarly, > specifies children
[01:35:56] <rindolf> How can I convert the page to the "print" CSS media?
[01:38:41] <sacho> do you need this for testing?
[01:40:44] <rindolf> sacho: who are you talking to?
[01:40:58] <sacho> you.
[01:41:16] <sacho> you can use chrome's developer tools to emulate different css media
[01:42:00] <rindolf> sacho: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5359943/javascript-set-print-stylesheet
[01:43:15] <rindolf> sacho: no, I want to create a printer friendly version of the page that uses jQuery to just display the page using the print @media.
[01:43:22] <rindolf> sacho: which I have a stylesheet for.
[01:43:32] <rindolf> sacho: in the <link rel="..."
[01:44:06] <sacho> you can use matchMedia in newer browsers.
[01:44:45] <rindolf> sacho: got it?
[01:45:30] <rindolf> http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-print-page-options/ - interesting.
[01:48:40] <bluesm> Is there "find" which works like "closest' ?
[01:48:56] <bluesm> I mean find only the first element ?
[01:49:02] <bluesm> "closest" ?
[01:49:04] <jillesme> .first()
[02:00:31] <bluesm> jillesme: first(".class-that-i-look-for")  ?
[02:08:33] <Cork> bluesm: find('.class-that-you-look-for').first()
[02:10:58] <joker_89> hi, now i am using jquery with three ul lists that are dependent, example: select a li element and then load a second list using jquery ajax for dooing a mysql query. Now I want to load all the lists once and then show the corresponent list, how can i load the data? with hidden lists or json?
[02:14:31] <Cork> joker_89: you could just fetch the new data and instead of removing it when you show another one, hide it with .hide() and then instead of doing the ajax call the next time, just show it
[02:15:51] <joker_89> wihout json?
[02:18:48] <rindolf> Hi all.
[02:19:12] <rindolf> http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/wysiwyt.html - this gives me an error when pressing the "Print this Page" link. What should I do?
[02:21:16] <Indriks> Hi there
[02:23:07] <Indriks> ..
[02:25:03] <jillesme> bluesm: $('.element').find('p').first(); for examlpe
[02:28:11] <sacho> you should probably start by looking into that syntax error
[02:28:26] <sacho> wait what.
[02:29:39] <sacho> The solutions for cross-domain inter-frame communication are like, the deep pits of web programming.
[02:29:40] <sacho> :(
[02:33:33] <rindolf> http://alistapart.com/article/printtopreview - found it.
[02:40:55] <lord4163> How do I determine if a property is set in an object?
[02:45:50] <lord4163> anyone?
[02:46:53] <__andrew_s> Ok you should use .css(propertyName)
[02:57:07] <sacho> lord4163, explain?
[02:59:48] <lord4163> sacho: maybe something more js specific, am asking in #javascript too: How can I check for all properties in an object to be empty instead of typing all out like this? if (data.name.length !== 0 && data.address.length !== 0 && data.phone.length !== 0) {
[03:00:52] <sacho> firefly has it covered.
[03:04:05] <avo_> what was the answer
[03:08:53] <lord4163> avo_: That I have to type them out
[03:08:58] <Xtreme> Hey guys. can you please tell me which plugin in used in the following webistes for box animation? http://www.poojamakhija.com/ http://tarajewellers.in/
[03:10:37] <sacho> lord4163, you don't have to type all of them out - there are ways to loop over object properties like "for ..in"
[03:12:20] <lord4163> sacho: too complicated :P
[03:12:22] <fulminator> Xtreme: the plugin that displays pictures horizontally (auto or by cliking the arrows) is called a slider. The second site is on a platform Wordpress and uses a plugin that it's called nivo slider
[03:13:21] <Xtreme> fulminator, not the sliding one..
[03:13:28] <Xtreme> the one for the 7 and 9 boxes
[03:13:35] <Xtreme> zoom and shrink etc
[03:15:33] <fulminator> Xtreme: on the second link you provided there is no other plugin. they wrote the code for that animation
[03:17:00] <fulminator> Xtreme: click-right on the page; select View page source. type Ctrl + F and search for animate-boxes.js  this is the script that does your animation.
[03:18:11] <Xtreme> fulminator, yes. i saw them... and my friend jillesme  told me that they are most probably custom.  so wanted to give it a shot.. (asking if anyone knows similar plugins)
[03:18:14] <Xtreme> fulminator, thanks
[03:19:51] <fulminator> Xtreme: this is not really what you want, but: http://jaukia.github.io/zoomooz/
[03:21:01] <jillesme> fulminator: Not looking for any plugin but that one is actually really cool, bookmarking it!
[03:21:28] <rindolf> Hi all.
[03:21:56] <rindolf> http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/wysiwyt.html - how do I enable the print stylesheet and/or print media here - I want to create a print preview button?
[03:24:32] <Xtreme> fulminator, instesting..
[03:24:37] <Xtreme> interesting*
[03:24:46] <fulminator> yes, but it was to complex for what you need
[03:24:50] <Xtreme> wtf is wrong with this keyboard..
[03:25:01] <Xtreme> yes. i agreed..
[03:25:11] <fulminator> you can easily custom that code from the second site.
[03:25:17] <fulminator> animate-boxes.js
[03:25:18] <Xtreme> agree* (okay, something is wrong with me too)
[03:25:24] <fulminator> :)
[03:25:41] <Xtreme> yup. doing the same as we speak..
[03:26:15] <Xtreme> i will customise it, make it easy. and will push it to githum
[03:26:17] <Xtreme> gub*
[03:26:24] <Xtreme> aah crap. github
[03:30:16] <GreatPotato> Is it even possible to use lazy loading on images on a responsive layout? Setting the height/width of the images is going to be impossible nearly right?
[03:37:37] <JamesLever> Hi, I am building a widget like http://www.hellobar.com/, that gets loaded into a site with with one line of javascript. The problem is that my widget depends on JQuery alot and screws up sites using older JQuerys by loading it ...
[03:38:38] <JamesLever> Now I check, if JQuery is already loaded and only load it otherwise ... but if the version is too old, my code gets screwed up
[03:38:49] <j_wright> jQuery.noConflict
[03:39:23] <JamesLever> j_wright, that s unfortunately too late ... as soon as I load Jquery, I already messed up the old version
[03:39:46] <JamesLever> is there a way to rename Jquery even before or while loading?
[03:39:57] <j_wright> it should restore them
[03:40:07] <JamesLever> Are you sure?
[03:41:01] <JamesLever> I try it out, thanks a lot!
[03:41:38] <j_wright> seems to work
[03:46:06] <drcea> hi how does it have to do with licence if i make a work similar to what i saw yet without even looking at the first ones code?
[03:51:08] <JamesLever> j_wright, works amazingly well! Thank you a lot.
[03:51:32] <JamesLever> Seems I didn't understand the whole consequence of noConflick()
[03:56:30] <bluesm> What is the meaning of comma in language ?]
[03:56:38] <bluesm> >> "hello" , "world"
[03:56:49] <bluesm> Sorry wrong channel

[03:59:54] <eizdealer> hey guys, i'm building a jquery ui widget, which calls some other non-jquery widget in _create. this other widget has a callback function included. in this callback function i will need to access the jquery ui element handel. usually "this" works, but since it's a different widget it just returns that widget's "this". anyone know how to fix this?
[04:09:22] <Abbas|> how do i refer to the div inside the loop when i do something like if(jQuery('.widget h3:contains("tags")').length >0){} .. inside the loop i want to add a class to the same .widget
[04:09:41] <Abbas|> inside the body*
[04:11:41] <theresajayne_> I am trying to do a dialog but its going past the dialog before showing the dialog, any idea how to make javascript wait for a response?
[04:21:03] <theresajayne_> is there an easy way to pass data from a fancybox into a javascript variable?
[04:23:16] <theresajayne_> ie can you do onClosed( myfunction(mydata);_ when the data is from inside the box?
[04:28:55] <ripthejacker> How can I programatically specify the slide transition duration in jQuery mobile?
[04:30:04] <ripthejacker> The slide transitions are too fast, I want to make it a little slower so they actually look like sliding.

[04:46:42] <kollapse> Hi. I'm having a little problem with $.ajax(). I'm trying to send some JSON data via POST but I get a "parsererror" status message on return. What could cause this ?
[04:47:44] <kollapse> I'm passing the object normally via JSON.stringify() so I don't know why this would happen.
[04:52:10] * theresajayne_ sobs, This is getting me down, I am trying to do an ajax call, its calling it i can see that, Its returning data, i can see that, is it hitting the success or error paths in the call - NOPE so what is it doing?
[04:54:33] <lord4163> rindolf: wb
[04:54:44] <rindolf> lord4163: hi.
[04:54:48] <rindolf> lord4163: got disconnected.
[04:56:05] <lord4163> I see
[04:59:49] <theresajayne_> is there anything wrong with this call http://jsfiddle.net/8b4S6/ its not hitting either success or error?
[05:00:00] <theresajayne_> but the call is getting a 200 OK
[05:02:02] <theresajayne_> do i need to return it in any special way? its currently just a string "191,91"
[05:07:12] <lord4163> Shouldn't it be without quotes? data:{review: selectedReviewType, jobId: jobId},
[05:08:55] <lord4163> theresajayne_:!!!
[05:09:13] <lord4163> theresajayne_: success two c!
[05:09:34] <theresajayne_> lord4163 I just realised that
[05:09:40] <theresajayne_> so frustrating
[05:11:52] <chilversc_> theresajayne_: also, on error you won't get back data, you'll just get the xhr
[05:11:52] <lord4163> theresajayne_: try http://jsfiddle.net/8b4S6/1/
[05:12:20] <theresajayne_> chilversc_ i only added the error as i wasnt getting the success
[05:12:41] <chilversc_> no javascript errors occuring?
[05:12:43] <theresajayne_> now its working thats gone
[05:13:40] <lord4163> thereajayne_: http://jsfiddle.net/8b4S6/2/
[05:13:48] <theresajayne_> chilversc no not in the area i am working - legacy page - 54 errors on it
[05:15:25] <lord4163> theresajayne_L Does it work now?
[05:15:31] <theresajayne_> yes
[05:15:52] <theresajayne_> i think i picked up the missing c the same time as lord4163
[05:16:18] <lord4163> good :)
[05:17:43] <lenswipee> Hi, the following line of code is not working as I'm expecting. It is only checking the first input in the form is empty AND not all inputs in the form. Help appreciated. See if ( jQuery.trim(jQuery('input.changePasswordInput').val()) == "" )
[05:18:55] <lenswipee> There are threee inputs with class "changePasswordInput".
[05:22:28] <lenswipee> Sorry, I mean that line of code is not working for the first input, but seems to be working for the other two below in form. odd.
[05:23:16] <jillesme> Can't you just do $('input.changePasswordInput').each($(this).val() = ""); ?
[05:24:43] <lenswipee> doesn't $('input.changePasswordInput') check them all?
[05:25:15] <lenswipee> when i do $('input.changePasswordInput').addClass('hasError') it applies to all inputs
[05:26:01] <kollapse> So anyone know why $.ajax() returns parsererror when I try to send JSON via POST ?
[05:26:44] <lenswipee> kollapse: make sure you specify datatype as 'json'
[05:27:09] <kollapse> lenswipee, I did.
[05:27:17] <kollapse> dataType: 'json'
[05:28:00] <lenswipee> kollapse: did you json decode it on server-side?
[05:29:03] <kollapse> lenswipee, Json decode what ? Server side does not receive anything, POST array is empty.
[05:35:18] <lenswipee> so does jQuery('input.changePasswordInput') only applies to the first input of class changePasswordInput?
[05:35:54] <Billy1> i have a form thats loaded with ajax, when loading i do a .empty() on the div and set the html() with the data. Part of the ajax data is a on("submit", "#formid", function) - when submitting the form it reloads it into the div and in IE its submitting multiple times depending on the amount of times its been reloaded
[05:36:08] <Billy1> i tried doing a .off but that doesn't seem to do anything
[05:39:11] <lenswipee> don't need .empty() if using html(data)
[05:40:02] <ripthejacker> How can I alter the slide transition duration in jquery mobile?
[05:40:16] <ripthejacker> the slide animations are too fast
[05:40:22] <ripthejacker> I want to make it slower
[05:40:41] <lenswipee> Billy1: it's expected. if POST data is already sent then refreshing page will re-send that POST data.
[05:41:02] <Billy1> lenswipee its not refreshing the page
[05:41:23] <Billy1> its ajax submitting the form, then populating a div with the response (happens to be the same form with no data)
[05:41:58] <lenswipee> only in IE? tried other browsers?
[05:42:04] <Billy1> other browsers work fine
[05:42:16] <Billy1> IE doesn't seem to remove the elements from the DOM
[05:43:17] <ripthejacker> How can i do slower transition animations in jquery mobile?
[05:43:44] <lenswipee> Billy1: what IE version?
[05:43:51] <ripthejacker> help /me
[05:43:53] <Billy1> 9
[05:44:01] * ripthejacker hello
[05:44:58] <lenswipee> Billy1: I doubt it's IE9 problem. I think you're doing something wrong. Most obvious is that the original form is not bring cleared so it's just adding to it.
[05:45:09] <kollapse> Here's the code for my problem - http://pastie.org/7747788 ; alert(txt) returns 'parseerror' and server side POST data is empty. Any help appreciated.
[05:45:32] <Billy1> but html() should clear everything in the div and so should .empty, correct?
[05:46:05] <lenswipee> Billy1: yep, which means you are not selecting the div correctly or the html is not valid.
[05:46:30] <Billy1> $("#editfile").html(data); is how im doing it, from the ajax success(data) method
[05:47:03] <ripthejacker> Can someone help me please
[05:47:24] <lenswipee> Billy1: Show me the html for #editfile
[05:48:37] <lenswipee> try $('div#editfile').html(data);
[05:49:11] <lenswipee> And I think you're suppose to use single quotes.
[05:51:59] <Billy1> the data being loaded is pretty extensive, but it validates in several html validators, i first thought it might of been invalid
[05:52:10] <Billy1> and div with single quotes still isn't wiping the old data out
[05:52:37] <Billy1> i know that its populating the div with the correct stuff because you can see the form clear out
[05:52:39] <recon_lap> hi, looking at doing an infinite scroll, anyone care to recommend one? had a try with pklauzinski/jscroll but cant seem to get it to work and don't think it'll do exactly what I'm after. I would like the scroll to trigger from the body tag but load data into a div at the bottom of the page. also I'm using bootstrap for the layout. an I'm a bit unsure how to go about populating the page at the start so there actually is a scroll bar to trigger.
[05:52:57] <lenswipee> Billy1: don't need all of it. show me the line of html with #editfile
[05:53:12] <lenswipee> Anyone know how to do console.log data?
[05:53:22] <caddoo> If a jQuery object has been used with a widget, ie $('.my-class').my_widget();
[05:53:29] <lenswipee> I tried jQuery(console.log(data)) and it failed
[05:53:41] <caddoo> How can I tell if $('.my-class').my_widget is initialized
[05:54:25] <Billy1> <div id="editfile" style="min-height:200px; display:none;"></div>
[05:54:34] <lenswipee> caddoo: add a class, so $('.my-class').addClass('initialised').my_widget();
[05:54:54] <Billy1> after clicking a button it shows the div and ajax loads the form
[05:55:02] <caddoo> duh lenswipee thanks
[05:55:09] <caddoo> simple and effective
[05:55:33] <lenswipee> Billy1: hmm odd, run code by a html validator.
[05:59:38] <fortmaccc> hi am in super new (about 30 mins of experience to jquery) can someone show me whats going on here: http://pastebin.com/Cx0uuPAg
[05:59:52] <fortmaccc> i am trying to print out that anchor tag inside the success function
[06:00:10] <fortmaccc> its tragic but all i need to know how to do is print HTML
[06:04:41] <lenswipee> $('div').html('Hey I'm Printing HTML');
[06:05:12] <csehl> $('.myclass .subclass').on ({ ... });  yeah but how do i   $(this + ' .subclass').on ({ ... }); ?
[06:06:32] <fortmaccc> thanks
[06:06:40] <recon_lap> any recommendations regarding implementing infinite scrolling?
[06:09:20] <lenswipee> recon_lap: read the manual
[06:10:15] <recon_lap> lenswipee: why answer with such a useless comment? what manual !!
[06:10:23] <lenswipee> csehl: what you trying to do in English.
[06:10:37] <lenswipee> recon_lap: goodluck.
[06:11:19] <csehl> lenswipee: im trying to select a subclass of $(this)
[06:12:38] <lenswipee> what do you think this is doing $('.myclass .subclass').on ({ ... });
[06:13:17] <lenswipee> <-- that is selecting the subclass
[06:14:18] <csehl> it selects the div marked with data-selected="1" in the following snippet: <div class="myclass"><div class="subclass" data-selected="1"></div></div>
[06:14:40] <csehl> yeah it selects a subclass
[06:14:53] <csehl> but of .myclass, not of $(this) generic
[06:18:23] <csehl> for example i have 5 <div class="myclass"><div class="subclass"></div></div> on a page. one of them is <div class="myclass"><div class="subclass active"></div></div>
[06:18:49] <eizdealer> hey guys, i'm building a jquery ui widget, which calls some other non-jquery widget in _create. this other widget has a callback function included. in this callback function i will need to access the jquery ui element handel. usually "this" works, but since it's a different widget it just returns that widget's "this". anyone know how to fix this?
[06:18:59] <lenswipee> csehl: and...
[06:20:22] <csehl> now in a general js with jQuery, i want to $('.myclass').on({ click: function(e) { e.preventDefailt(); $(>>exactly the .subclass in the clicked .myclass<<).addClass('active'); });
[06:21:28] <csehl> $('.myclass .subclass).removeClass('active'); isnt the problem, it selects every .subclass matching
[06:21:54] <csehl> but adding the Class 'active' to exactly the .subclass in the .myclass that was clicked is the problem
[06:22:10] <lenswipee> you do $(this).find('.subclass':first)
[06:22:30] <lenswipee> you do $(this).find('.subclass:first')
[06:26:31] <csehl> lenswipee: it works, thanks a lot
[06:31:46] <lenswipee> if ( $.trim($('input.required').val() ) == "" ) { // does not work on first input in form}
[06:31:55] <lenswipee> help please

[07:13:36] <relipse> how do i create a new '<li><span>foobar</span></li>' using jquery ?
[07:14:38] <Kuifje111> never mind. got it
[07:14:59] <Kuifje111> relipse, you can do $("<li>this is a list item</li>");
[07:15:06] <relipse> thanks
[07:19:11] <lenswipee> hi, how to set an index and a value for an js array?
[07:19:32] <lenswipee> var $arr = [];
[07:20:15] <lenswipee> now how i add index = 'name', and value='bob' to that $arr?
[07:21:58] <relipse> .push()
[07:22:11] <relipse> dunno about jquery
[07:22:32] <lenswipee> .push() doesn;t allow you to specify your own index
[07:22:37] <relipse> duhh
[07:22:47] <relipse> why would you it is an array
[07:22:57] <relipse> var $assoc_arr = {};
[07:23:06] <relipse> $assoc_arr[5] = 42;
[07:23:25] <relipse> i think that is what you want
[07:23:35] <lenswipee> $assoc_arr['name'] = 'bob'; correct?
[07:23:39] <relipse> yep
[07:23:46] <lenswipee> bingo thanks
[07:27:22] <lenswipee> $assoc_arr.length gives undefined...
[07:27:44] <lenswipee> worked for standard array
[07:27:48] <lenswipee> ?
[07:30:30] <NoiseEee> lenswipee: there are no 'associative arrays' in javascript.
[07:30:35] <NoiseEee> lenswipee: there are objects.
[07:30:55] <lenswipee> var $assoc_arr = {};
[07:31:06] <lenswipee> was told that is an assoc array
[07:31:16] <NoiseEee> no, that's an object.
[07:31:35] <NoiseEee> it acts similar to what you might think of as an 'associative array' but it does not have array methods
[07:32:06] <NoiseEee> http://eloquentjavascript.net/ @ lenswipee
[07:32:37] <lenswipee> var $arr = [];
[07:32:44] <lenswipee> is that an array?
[07:32:56] <NoiseEee> it is, but it only accepts numbers for indexes.
[07:33:01] <lenswipee> and how it differs from var $arr = new Array();
[07:33:07] <Abbas5> i can check whether a div has a string or not using this > if ($("#trackingnumber:contains('Hello')").length != 0)
[07:33:19] <Abbas5> but, is there a way to do the same with jQuery(this):contains ....
[07:33:37] <Abbas5> since i have to check multiple divs and im using jQuery(div).each(function(){})
[07:35:02] <Aamir> Abbas5: try indexOf ?
[07:35:19] <Abbas5> Aamir, i tried using that, but it doenst play well with jQuery(this)
[07:35:28] <Abbas5> i tried > if(jQuery(this).innerHTML.indexOf("This topic is:") != -1){
[07:35:45] <Aamir> $(this).html().indexOf('Hello')
[07:35:51] <Abbas5> ah
[07:35:58] <Abbas5> thank you
[07:36:04] <Aamir> :) you got the point
[07:36:25] <Aamir> try this.innerHTML.indexOf may be
[07:36:26] <lenswipee> NoiseEee: ???
[07:36:36] <Abbas5> .html() worked fine
[07:37:17] <NoiseEee> lenswipee: it does not differ
[07:37:54] <lenswipee> NoiseEee: so var $arr = [] is a short hand of writing it?
[07:38:17] <NoiseEee> lenswipee: yes, you should familiarize yourself with basic javascript via the link i pasted.
[07:38:32] <lenswipee> NoiseEee: thanks

[08:13:41] <untaken> http://jsfiddle.net/PUjnZ/
[08:13:55] <untaken> I have copied the code there, but can't even get the dialog to show up atm
[08:14:20] <maxmoore14> there appears to be a known issue with the jquery blog rss feed. anyone have more info on that?
[08:14:28] <untaken> I don't need to add jQuery(document).ready(function () { in jsfiddle I guess
[08:18:00] <Trisox> any one an idea ?
[08:18:01] <Trisox>  Object doesn't support this property or method      addEvents: function() {             $('.rootMenu').each(function(index, el){                 this.addEvent($(el));             }.bind(this));         }	
[08:18:04] <Trisox> ie7 / ie8

[08:23:43] <PerlWebDev> what's a touch event, FrameFever?
[08:24:16] <PerlWebDev> if it is just a touch screen, then sounds like a mouse event type thing
[08:24:43] <bluepnume> Is there any way of getting a reference to an open popup window? Say I just called window.open but didn't save the reference -- can I get it back?
[08:24:47] <RNT> is not as normal mouseclick?

[08:49:47] <Kuifje111> you could try the size attribute

[09:21:08] <awc737> How can I tell this function only to slideUp (line 1) IF the mouse is out
[09:21:12] <awc737> I still need the rest binding though
[09:21:32] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/q4e
[09:25:00] <mg9831> laravel eh
[09:25:12] <awc737> mg9831, it's jquery
[09:26:49] <awc737> any ideas?
[09:35:26] <awc737> Is it possible to check it the mouse is over an element at any time?
[09:36:00] <Gazpacho> it's possible inside a mouse event handler
[09:36:34] <Gazpacho> check whether the element is visible and the mouse position is within its rectangle
[09:39:38] <Xtreme>  i made one of that finally
[09:39:38] <Xtreme>  http://rnd.mayurvirkar.com/boxes-9/
[09:39:38] <Xtreme>  check it :)
[09:39:38] <Xtreme>  actually, it should be called boxes-6
[09:39:38] <Xtreme>  but my friend told me late that she needed only 6 boxes.
[09:39:39] <Xtreme>  anyways.. i am uploading to github.
[09:39:40] <Xtreme>  can anyone suggest a name for it?
[09:40:14] <Xtreme> where is everyone today?
[09:42:42] <amph1bius> you have repetitive code
[09:42:50] <amph1bius> couldnt you make a function that animated all 6 boxes
[09:42:57] <amph1bius> instead of defining it 6 times
[09:43:08] <Gazpacho> more like boxes-sux
[09:43:17] <Gazpacho> nah i'm just kidding it's ok
[09:43:24] <Xtreme> well. thats the reason i am upping to github.
[09:43:28] <Xtreme> people can improve and share
[09:43:37] <Xtreme> and i will be also optimising it with time
[09:43:43] <Xtreme> there is a small flaw in it too
[09:43:59] <amph1bius> also if you move your cursor over it fast
[09:44:02] <amph1bius> it glitches and stutters :)
[09:44:20] <Gazpacho> yeah it oscillates
[09:44:29] <Xtreme> amph1bius, yes i know.. how can i fix it?
[09:45:25] <bluesm> Does .click works on collections ?
[09:45:47] <diamonds> Xtreme: see also http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[09:46:23] <amph1bius> desandro is a genius
[09:49:39] <awc737> I don't want my slider to queue up a million times if the user hovers-in/hovers-out really fast
[09:49:43] <awc737> Am I on the right track?
[09:49:44] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/q4r
[09:49:59] <awc737> I don't know where I should set doneSliding back to false
[09:52:49] <awc737> indeed
[09:52:53] <awc737> this seems to make it work smoothly
[09:53:02] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/q4t
[09:53:46] <Xtreme> https://github.com/mayurvirkar/MagicDivs
[09:53:59] <Xtreme> incase anyone is willing to improve it :)
[09:59:51] <awc737> whattt is it
[10:01:07] <awc737> the spacing is a little messed up sometimes Xtreme

[10:11:19] <dirty_d> any ideas?

[10:19:19] <gnarf> readme is just wrong
[10:20:09] <zergion_> I have a <p> element with an image nearby, if I hover that <p> I want the image to change opacity. I have tried this: $(this).closest('img').css('opacity', 1); but it does not work.

[11:16:27] <Whirl3d> Good Afternoon, #jquery.
[11:16:35] <cwatson> I want the image to slide left and right and I'm not sure how. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/1/
[11:17:29] <cwatson> Update, lol - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/2/
[11:19:53] <naeluh> hey can someone take a look at my fiddle I am trying to show  a new select list on select ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/hEpDb/ for some reason my display won't work ? any pointers ?
[11:21:59] <Whirl3d> cwatson, I just glanced at your fiddle and have a couple of suggestions off the cuff:
[11:22:14] <Whirl3d> cwatson, do you intend to slide the image or the slider holding the images.
[11:22:59] <cwatson> I just want to make the image slide from left to right to show the other image. They are in a hidden div right now.
[11:23:10] <cwatson> Whirl3d*
[11:23:25] <Whirl3d> cwatson, try sliding the #imgSlider, not the image
[11:23:44] <cwatson> Whirl3d: I think I tried that.
[11:24:03] <cwatson> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/3/
[11:24:13] <naeluh> It seems like the display none isnt working for some resason ?
[11:24:30] <Whirl3d> cwatson, the slider holds the images that are always aligned horizontally, one after the other. The images never move, just the slider. It's width is wide enough to show all the images. The imgContainer has overflow hidden and makes it so you can't see the other images.
[11:30:50] <hyper33> anyone can help with this jqm issue?  dialog does not stay open.  http://jsbin.com/eredac/1
[11:31:57] <cwatson> Whirl3d: I think I understand. I tried another way and it's not working - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/4/
[11:33:08] <Ricaz> So I have an element that gets 'contenteditable' when you dblclick it, but I want that attribute gone when user clicks on something else or it otherwise loses 'focus'. How?
[11:33:24] <cwatson> Whirl3d: I appreciate the help man. I guess I'm just not getting it.
[11:33:31] <Ricaz> i.e. which event can I use for this?
[11:36:43] <Sypris> Hello :) I'm trying to distinguish between which dynamic button was pressed with deleting content from a page.  The buttons have the same class name and different ID's, but I have no idea how to tell if ID 1 was pressed or ID 5 without actually typing the direct ID in the event.  Could anyone point me in the right direction?  Looking to learn.
[11:37:30] <ilteris_> hey guys, can you load this page http://67.243.59.135/ without any javscript errors?
[11:37:49] <darkmutt> is there a way for jquery to detect if an element is in the same row/column without them being in a table or not unless i mark them specifically  to that?
[11:38:04] <ilteris_> currently I am getting a javascript error on this line var descriptionDistance = $j(".short-description").offset().top; but I cannot find the line for the life of me.
[11:38:22] <ilteris_> it was there, I deleted it and I am still getting the error. This is really weird.
[11:40:30] <Gazpacho> ilteris: clear your browser cache
[11:41:11] <Cork> cwatson: http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/6/
[11:41:17] <Xal_> Is there a way to make an element invisible while leaving its contents visible?
[11:41:23] <ilteris_> Gazpacho: I did but still getting it.
[11:41:37] <Gazpacho> maybe you're insane
[11:41:50] <Cork> Xal_: how would you hide and show an element at the same time?
[11:42:20] <Gazpacho> xal: no that doesn't make any sense
[11:42:21] <Cork> Xal_: of you want to animate a background image or something create an additional element and position it below
[11:42:28] <Xal_> I have a span with a box shadow on it. I want to gradually show and hide the shadow while leaving the contents visible
[11:42:43] <Xal_> If it were a background image, it would be easy
[11:43:02] <Xal_> Box shadows are harder to work with
[11:43:12] <Cork> Xal_: why not just animate the shadow?
[11:43:26] <Cork> animate the color of the shadow from transparent to the color you want
[11:43:27] <Xal_> ...
[11:43:33] <Xal_> I tried that
[11:43:41] <Cork> ok?
[11:43:53] <Xal_> It didn't work. It had no effect.
[11:45:50] <snkcld> i am using submitHandler in $.validate to submit a form via ajax, how would i call preventDefault() on the event object for the submitHandler?
[11:47:36] <Xal_> Can someone give me the correct code for animating box shadow color?
[11:50:11] <BillCriswell> Xal_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4133366/correct-way-to-animate-box-shadow-with-jquery
[11:50:32] <Xal_> Yes, that's exactly the page I was just on.
[11:50:53] <Cork> ah, right i ended up write an animation extension for this
[11:51:56] <Cork> Xal_: this one should prob do it for you (haven't tested it my self though) http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/
[11:52:14] <Cork> basically there isn't anything in jquery that parses the box-shadow combined value
[11:52:26] <Cork> so a plugin need to add that part
[11:57:56] <louism2_> Hey everyone, I am having issue comparing the heights of DOM elements.  When I take $(element_1).css('height')  and compare if to $(element_2).css('height') using greater than I tells me the shorter element is actually larger.  Any ideas?  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5497480
[11:58:30] <BillCriswell> louism2_: compare .height() instead.
[11:58:33] <Gazpacho> yeah that
[11:58:50] <louism2_> BillCriswell: I shall try,  thanks
[12:02:51] <BillCriswell> I was going to explain why but he left. =(
[12:03:58] <cwatson> Cork++
[12:03:59] <cwatson> Thank you man!
[12:04:20] <cwatson> Whirl3d++ Thanks for helping as well.
[12:05:04] <afrance> I have a form that submits via ajax, receives back some info and updates a div, pretty standard, however everytime I submit it creates more and more requests... common sense seems to say that the bind is happening when the new page is being pulled in, how can I prevent that?
[12:07:48] <darkmutt> ill ask again as earlier i had no response is there a way of telling whether or not an element not in a table is in the same row/column as the one i hover mouseover?
[12:09:19] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: That question confused the shit out of me.
[12:09:52] <darkmutt> well i have 20 divs with set sizes which make up 5columns 4rows but theyre not in a table
[12:10:23] <darkmutt> is there an easy way to check which divs are in the same row and which in the same column as the one i hover mouse over?
[12:12:15] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: Hmmm... sounds like fun
[12:12:29] <BillCriswell> Let me try something.
[12:13:11] <darkmutt> i was thinking of using % and going by the nth sibling element for column but i don't have a good idea for a dynamic number of rows cause for a static i could go by calculation
[12:13:41] <mikeB> Hello, I have a jquery/xml question
[12:13:59] <darkmutt> `ask
[12:13:59] <b-ot> darkmutt: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:14:40] <mikeB> Sorry, getting there, Im trying to use jquery to get a block/chunk of xml from a bigger chunk of xml, sorry stuggling to find the words.
[12:14:48] <hyper33> how can changePage can be called as soon as possible after a page is loaded?
[12:15:23] <mikeB> Getting XML using a $.ajax....  so have xml want to do something like chunk=$('jobs',myxml);
[12:15:25] <darkmutt> $(document).ready(function(){}); hyper33
[12:15:37] <darkmutt> mikeB, isn't that simple string searching?
[12:15:45] <mikeB> then I want to make a new xmldoc from that.
[12:16:13] <cwatson> Cork: Do you know how to code it so that it ends the beginning shows, etc? - I got prev to work - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/7/
[12:16:57] <mikeB> Eg I fetch one large amount of xml from the server then I want to see if an element exists in it and if so get that and make a new xmldocument that I can then parse and throw away the initial download.
[12:17:24] <darkmutt> mikeB try to give a jsfiddle for ppl to work with much better chance of helping you :)
[12:17:27] <mikeB> darkmutt: I realise that Im not making much sense, hence the lack of success with google :)
[12:17:44] <mikeB> Thanks I will have a go.
[12:17:56] <afrance> I have an event for keyup tied to an input that filters as you type with an ajax request, each request results in a greater and greater number requests, searching for "1234567890" ultimatly results in 199 requests instead of 10.  How have I failed so hard?
[12:18:41] <darkmutt> recurency perhaps? try to give us a fiddle to check afrance
[12:19:40] <afrance> Not sure how I could turn this into, how about a real version?  http://outof10k.com/item_types
[12:20:06] <BillCriswell> darkmutt: Got it! http://jsbin.com/ohovuw/1/edit
[12:20:59] <darkmutt> ohhh that is perfect BillCriswell you solved my problem :D now i can make somethin alike to gridaccordion gallery in less then 50lines hehe :D
[12:21:13] <BillCriswell> Good luck and have fun!
[12:22:53] <naeluh> hey I posted a question on stackoverflow can someone take a look I am stumped http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16324608/display-consecutive-select-lists-on-select-up-to-4-lists-and-feed-data-to-select
[12:23:20] <naeluh> I am trying to ouput more html around my select list
[12:23:49] <naeluh> cause for some reason it is only rendering my select list and that is it ?
[12:24:27] <afrance> It seems like the bind is being rebinded for all the elements on each request... but since I'm only updating a portion of the page I don't see why that would actually be happening.
[12:24:48] <snkcld> i was able to call e.preventDefault() to prevent the window unload bound function from being called, but then my custom event handler wasnt called either...
[12:25:06] <mikeB> darkmutt: Okay, so I dont really know how to use jsfiddle :( but i have typed something maybe you could look?   http://jsfiddle.net/drjAz/1/
[12:25:06] <naeluh> It seems like jquery shouldnt remove any html but for some reason it is
[12:25:35] <mikeB> I dont see the alerts does it stop you doing that in fiddle?
[12:27:10] <hyper33> darkmutt:  no document.ready fires the changepage event too early and it flashes the second page briefly but then reverts to the first page.  same for pageshow.  you can check it out here:  http://jsbin.com/eredac/2
[12:27:14] <darkmutt> mikeB while i dunno next to nothin bout xml i can see without that that your quotation mark is placed badly and there's a parenthesis left completely open
[12:27:45] <naeluh> maybe I should using divs but I dont understand why that make any difference
[12:27:54] <mikeB> oops
[12:29:43] <mikeB> darkmutt: Edits are misbehaving :(,  but with the bracket added,  the first bit is a piece of xml ( actually this is coming form the server in my app )  this I can do fine, and I can search find etc
[12:30:10] <mikeB> What I want to do is get a bit of it ( jobs ) then keep that seperatly
[12:30:29] <snkcld> ie9 is calling window.beforeunload when my submit button is being clicked (even though i have a submitHandler attached to the submission of the form). how do i prevent ie9 from calling beforeunload?
[12:30:53] <mikeB> Ahh, impossible to edit in jsfiddle :(
[12:31:04] <Ricaz> How can I check if an element's class contains specified string?
[12:31:13] <mikeB> Any chance that anyone else can help?  http://jsfiddle.net/drjAz/1/
[12:31:54] <darkmutt> possible to edit there's an update button
[12:32:14] <mikeB> Yes, but cursor not where txt apears
[12:32:21] <mikeB> I will try another browser
[12:32:22] <darkmutt> snkcld, i'd advice against using internet explorer any version for that matter to be honest
[12:32:42] <Ricaz> In a loop, will "this.css()" be the same as "$(this).css()"?
[12:33:13] <snkcld> darkmutt, sure. but in the interest of serving any guest's browser, im trying to make my app work for ie
[12:33:18] <BillCriswell> Ricaz: No.
[12:33:33] <BillCriswell> this.css() would be an error probably
[12:34:10] <snkcld> anyway, is it possible to inform IE that you are using a javascript event handler? and not to call beforeunload?
[12:34:12] <darkmutt> snkcld, ill wish you goodluck with that but unless M$ starts giving normal working browser behaviour you're gonna work yourself to death for stubborn ekhem finish my sentence with something not nice :)
[12:34:12] <mikeB> Okay, I updated the fiddle using FF and its fine, still does not show alerts thought should it?
[12:34:44] <snkcld> darkmutt, i completely agree with you
[12:34:50] <darkmutt> and where is html where's css and the server for it to work with mikeB if you only specify js without anything else then it won't show
[12:35:21] <hyper33> ok i figured out that my problem is specific to calling changepage with data-role='dialog'.  calling it too early will result in it immediately closing.  any thoughts?
[12:35:37] <mikeB> Its got some alerts, I will change to use a text area.
[12:35:57] <mikeB> Thanks for helping, sorry, I know it must be frustraiting
[12:36:17] <darkmutt> least i can do is try mikeB
[12:36:27] <darkmutt> hyper33, im not exactly sure what you want there done anymore
[12:37:25] <PerlWebDev> here's an interesting thing... to our QA guy... scripts like jCarousel lock up if you ninja click the buttons (rapid click faster than someone probably should). Anything I can do short of smacking him to keep the code from bogging down the browser?
[12:38:07] <hyper33> darkmutt: i want to open a dialog immediately after page load using changePage.  but it doesn't work when data-role='dialog' only when data-role='page'
[12:38:40] <mikeB> Still cant get it to run :(  http://jsfiddle.net/drjAz/9/
[12:38:48] <darkmutt> hyper33, why not make everything display none until AFTER your dialog?
[12:39:27] <darkmutt> mikeB, there's nothing to parse for the script at all so how is it to run it on nothing?
[12:40:10] <mikeB> Umm, the script starts $(document).ready is that wrong?
[12:41:02] <mikeB> Sorry, I havn't used jsfiddle before Im just struggling to get started.
[12:41:12] <darkmutt> mikeB, i think you should go over the basics of how js and xml work before trying that again
[12:41:19] <mikeB> What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/drjAz/9/
[12:41:39] <hyper33> darkmutt:  i don't think that is the issue.  I need the dialog to stay open I am not worried about the page being visible before it opens.
[12:42:08] <darkmutt> ok now im simply confused
[12:43:05] <mikeB> darkmutt: I think Im okay with the basics,  I will simplify the jsfiddle could you look and get it to run then I can add my real question, It seems that my new question is now, how do I test something with jsfiddle.  Im sorry.
[12:43:46] <darkmutt> mikeB, i'm sorry but you really should get some better grasp on the basics and that'd be the best way to help you
[12:47:00] <shoky> mikeB:  http://jsfiddle.net/drjAz/13/
[12:47:10] <hyper33> darkmutt:  did you check the jsbin?
[12:48:22] <darkmutt> i did but as i mentioned i simply don't get what exactly do you want there english isn't my main language
[12:50:48] <hyper33> darkmutt:  do you see how the dialog flashes then disappears?
[12:51:46] <darkmutt> that only happened for me after now you mentioned it when i tried to refresh it bout 10times a second otherwise it appears nicely after clicking on open dialog
[12:52:22] <hyper33> darkmutt:  heh.  the point is that it should open automatically.  open dialog is just there for demonstration.
[12:52:51] <mikeB> darkmutt, Hmm, Okay so now I dont even know what my question was :(   I was getting Invalidxml in safari.  I will test some more,,Thanks for you efforts, could not see all the missing )'s etc for looing.
[12:54:02] <afrance> MikeB: did you see shokys comment? He has it working for you.. You have a lot of syntax errors ($.pasrseXML) and invalid XML (no closing </parts>) his works as expected...
[12:54:29] <shoky> his xml was fine
[12:54:43] <mikeB> shokys: AH,,, I see [0] is my friend :)
[12:54:47] <mikeB> Doh!
[12:55:04] <afrance> the validator I ran it through said it was mising a closing tag (</parts>)
[12:55:07] <shoky> and $('#ta1') instead of $('ta1'), very friendly also
[12:55:07] <mikeB> Because its returned an array of objects right?
[12:55:16] <shoky> yes, a jquery collection
[12:55:26] <mikeB> Yeah, I know its was full of typos sorry :(
[12:55:47] <afrance> From version 3: <xml><jobs><job>1</job><job>2</job></jobs><parts><part>1</part><part>2</part></xml> (no closing parts)
[12:55:53] <mikeB> Thanks so much for helping. I get most stuff but collections get me everytime.
[12:56:08] <cwatson> Can someone help me with making the images start from the beginning, etc? - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/7/
[12:56:29] <mikeB> Yeah Sorry, It is the [0] from $('jobs', xmlfromserver)[0] that I was missing
[12:56:45] <shoky> afrance: ah, guess he fixed it sometime
[12:57:41] <mikeB> afrance: shoky:  I was really struggling to edit cleanly on safari for some reason switched to FF and it was fine, so there were a few versions that would never have worked.
[12:58:32] <afrance> no biggie, just wanted to make sure you were aware incase you went to a differet set of code not on fiddle...
[12:59:56] <Xal_> I'm trying to animate a box shadow. I'm using this plugin (http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/) but it still isn't working.
[13:00:41] <Xal_> never mind
[13:02:33] <wilkinsmc>  for some reason in jquery window.location only goes to the right place in the original html file
[13:02:38] <afrance> I don't really know how I could convert this to a fiddle so heres the real URL: http://outof10k.com/item_types there is an event bound to the search form (both on submit and on keyup) that works kind of like an autocomplete for the table of data below it.  The div with the data is then updated.  However, each submit or key press results in more and more requests, 10 real submisions = over 200
[13:02:38] <afrance> requests.  I'm thinking that the bind is getting bound to other elements that are coming from the reply but they shouldn't and I'm not sure why they are.  Any ideas?
[13:04:31] <sacho> bind to a container using delegation if needed, and use $.throttle
[13:04:44] <sacho> Ithat's without viewing the code)
[13:06:26] <afrance> thanks, I'll give it a look
[13:07:35] <djQuery> cwatson, to make it go infinite move the first li to the end of the ul
[13:08:52] <wilkinsmc> you guys know why window.location allows me to go to the right place on one page but not another with the same destination for window.location?
[13:09:13] <wilkinsmc> two different html pages, same destination for window.location, both html pages in same directory
[13:09:18] <Xal_> This is strange. I have multiple animations being performed on a rollover. Some of them work every time, but some of them only start working the second time I roll over the button
[13:10:50] <Xal_> ugh.. again. never mind
[13:13:44] <darkmutt> `fiddle
[13:23:09] <wilkinsmc> I'm trying to make a navbar that sets window.location to a click event that takes the window to another html document. The only document that redirects to the right page is the home.html page, even though the other html pages use the same paths as the original and are in the same directory
[13:26:17] <albivian> hi guy
[13:26:18] <albivian> s
[13:26:40] <albivian> Is it possible to remove appended elements?
[13:26:53] <albivian> if the elements were appended via iterator
[13:29:46] <Slartibart> I'm using .beforeSend with my $.ajax calls to read a csrf cookie and jqXHR.setRequestHeader(). But it seems some race takes place when doing a lot of ajax calls next to simultaneously, now and then the header and cookie don't match. Is there a way to make the Read cookie+Set header atomic? Or do I have to do the obvious and bundle the ajax calls together to cut down on the number of calls?
[13:38:51] <afrance> ah, found it... was just how I was fetching the content blocks and where I was flushing the javascript buffers with cakephp.... every submission was including a new event binding so the same elements ended up with a bunch of event bindings tied to it...
[13:39:14] <afrance> doing the same thing I tried earlier with no change fixed it... =\
[13:45:07] <xenaxon> hi. guys is anyone an Established member on digitalpoint?
[13:46:48] <wilkinsmc> titays?
[13:52:54] <Xal_> Is there a way to animate shadow boxes on versions of IE earlier than 9? I'm using pie.htc if that helps.
[13:56:11] <Xal_> Actually, the shadow boxes aren't showing up at all on versions earlier than 9
[13:59:46] <delinquentme> .success is what actions to run on a completed ajax call ja?
[14:00:04] <delinquentme> or .done?
[14:01:06] <xenaxon> check the manual
[14:01:08] <xenaxon> delinquentme
[14:01:14] <xenaxon> there is a success and a completed
[14:01:22] <xenaxon> each with diff function
[14:01:25] <bil> they fire at different times i think
[14:01:41] <delinquentme> seems .success is depreciated
[14:02:52] <delinquentme> I want to assign a value to an ajax call
[14:04:14] <delinquentme> I want the response to an ajax call assigned to a var
[14:04:19] <delinquentme> external to the ajax call itself
[14:08:09] <NoiseEee> function() { var someThing = 'yes!!!';   var xhr = $.ajax(//etc; can use 'someThing);  xhr.done(function(data) { //can also use 'someThing'!!});  }
[14:21:55] <wilkinsmc> do you guys know why, when I'm setting window.location to the same location in two separate html files, only one of the html files succesfully reaches the location when the action is taken?
[14:22:08] <wilkinsmc> the other one goes to a "index.html" page, and i don't even have a page called that
[14:28:36] <cwatson> Can someone help me with making this infinite? - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/9/
[14:28:56] <cwatson> So frustrated, lol
[14:29:29] <Xal_> What do you mean, infinite? You mean return back to the first one?
[14:29:33] <edoop> interesting to make a box layout of my content
[14:29:54] <romane> hello. can anyone help with a jquery conent hover issue?
[14:30:02] <cwatson> Xal_: Correct, sorry.
[14:30:18] <cwatson> Updated (so it hides): http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/10/
[14:30:30] <romane> i am using the content hover plugin and can't align my divs
[14:31:44] <wilkinsmc> i guess my problem is so complicated it cannot be resolved by the common bear
[14:31:50] <wilkinsmc> guess i'll have to be smarter than the average bear
[14:31:53] <Xal_> cwatson, you need to continuously reposition earlier slides at the end of the list. That needs to be part of the sliding process.
[14:32:13] <romane> how do you have the code not override the css in this? 					var $ch_wrapper = $('<div>').addClass('ch_element').addClass(settings.wrapper_class).css({ 'width':w, 'height':h, 'float':'left', 'margin':'10px 10px 0 0', 'position':'relative', 'overflow':'hidden' }).insertAfter($this);                                                $(".ch_element").css("float", "left").css("marginLeft", "0px").css("marginTop", "10px").css("width","240");
[14:33:25] <cwatson> Xal_: Is that worth the effort?
[14:34:47] <Xal_> It's not that hard
[14:35:04] <romane> xal > are you talking to me?
[14:35:19] <cwatson> Eh, I'm a newbie and have been trying for hours. I guess back to the books.
[14:35:20] <Xal_> sorry, no. cwatson
[14:35:21] <cwatson> Thank you.
[14:35:32] <romane> ah ok
[14:35:49] <romane> maybe i can help cwatson. what is the issue real quick?
[14:36:10] <cwatson> I'm trying to make the slide show at the end go to the beginning - http://jsfiddle.net/AxURN/10/
[14:36:40] <edoop> if you want set infinite
[14:37:12] <romane> so when you get to the last slide you want to to go back to the 1st one or just kept rotating thru?
[14:37:12] <cwatson> edoop: set infinite?
[14:37:15] <edoop> do you set . loop
[14:37:28] <edoop> yes i mean infinite gal
[14:37:30] <slothbear> Is there a jQuery option… or maybe a plugin… that would allow an optgroup header to be selectable?
[14:37:42] <cwatson> romane: yes.
[14:38:21] <Xal_> slothbear, have you considered indenting the rest of the option tags?
[14:39:02] <slothbear> Xal_:  hm, so don't really use optgroups, just indentation. that sounds like a better way all around.
[14:39:08] <slothbear> wow
[14:40:31] <romane> read this cwatson http://www.slidesjs.com/
[14:40:43] <romane> it might have what you need

[14:41:11] <edoop> based on Jquery?
[14:41:12] <romane> has anyone ever used the content hover jquery plugin?
[14:41:15] <wilkinsmc> cwatson: watch the lynda jquery video titled : homepage marquee
[14:41:15] <cwatson> romane: I don't want a plugin.
[14:41:25] <wilkinsmc> it'll teach you everything you need to know about how to do what you want, and more
[14:41:45] <cwatson> wilkinsmc: I'll do that, thanks!
[14:42:10] <romane> ah ok

[14:51:11] <aghouseh> http://www.ie6countdown.com/join-us.aspx
[14:53:43] <cwatson> wilkinsmc: That Lynda.com tutorial didn't help. That marquee doesn't go from end to beginning. You click individual links.

[16:20:23] <tw2113> are you sure you're not concatinating?
[16:20:47] <MickRip> awc737: that's weird. Maybe just cast them both (but it shouldn't happen)
[16:21:57] <awc737> MickRip, here is my entire code http://paste.laravel.com/q6z
[16:22:04] <awc737> line 17 is what's alerting 14, 15 etc
[16:23:12] <tw2113> i wonder if it's getting cast as a string at some point
[16:23:37] <MickRip> you can just use parseInt and be done with it :P
[16:24:41] <awc737> thanks guys
[16:24:55] <shoky> you can also use .sort() probably..
[16:27:09] <MickRip> I thought something like countFirst++ would change it back into a float anyway
[16:28:27] <awc737> MickRip, countSecond = parseInt(countFirst) + parseInt(countSecond); is still resulting in 14, 15, etc
[16:28:43] <MickRip> awc737: eeeeyyyy??? :P
[16:29:04] <TheEternalAbyss> can someone explain why my !importants are being ignored in my css for the serach engine?
[16:29:05] <TheEternalAbyss> http://www.ideatreesolutions.com/dev/ITSv3/
[16:29:25] <TheEternalAbyss> oh sorry
[16:29:29] <MickRip> awc737: I'm taking this to jsFiddle to try and make it broken
[16:29:29] <awc737> MickRip, waaaaaa
[16:29:29] <TheEternalAbyss> nevermind wrong window
[16:29:32] <MickRip> TheEternalAbyss: what's CSS?
[16:29:36] <awc737> lol k
[16:29:36] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[16:29:40] <TheEternalAbyss> my bad :)
[16:29:41] <MickRip> haha
[16:33:06] <MickRip> awc737: http://jsfiddle.net/rMTTb/ <--- hmmmm!!!
[16:33:08] <shoky> awc737: http://paste.laravel.com/q6H
[16:33:47] <awc737> hmm
[16:34:08] <MickRip> awc737: it should "just work"
[16:34:18] <awc737> shoky, I have a huge list of objects, over ten document types. I'm trying to put all Brochures first, followed by all Sizing
[16:34:23] <awc737> would that sorting accomplish that?
[16:34:30] <shoky> awc737: yes
[16:36:03] <hyper33> Made a little progress on my issue.  Anyone have any input on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16326072/why-does-opening-a-dialog-too-early-fail-w-jquery-mobile-changepage ?
[16:37:07] <awc737> shoky, can it be expanded upon for a third type?
[16:37:13] <shoky> awc737: sure
[16:37:27] <shoky> awc737: http://jsfiddle.net/rMTTb/1/
[16:37:32] <awc737> shoky, this is genious
[16:37:39] <shoky> (that's not with a 3rd yet)
[16:37:40] <awc737> thanks for your example MickRip it proves something was off with my code
[16:37:49] <awc737> I will try
[16:38:31] <MickRip> awc737: it works if you do countOne = "1 "  (spaces) .. or other strange things which creep in when parsing
[16:40:56] <awc737> shoky, would it only take 2 more else if's to account for a third variable?
[16:41:08] <awc737> or is it... exponential
[16:41:14] <shoky> awc737:  now you can add as many as you like, easily:  http://jsfiddle.net/rMTTb/2/
[16:41:50] <shoky> it's not exponential :P
[16:41:54] <awc737> holy crap
[16:41:58] <awc737> i could kiss you
[16:42:11] <shoky> you could
[16:42:16] <awc737> i would*
[16:42:23] <awc737> if i could
[16:43:08] <shoky> that's more than okay
[16:47:16] <awc737> hmm the third one isn't working
[16:47:28] <awc737> would the backslash effect it?
[16:47:37] <awc737> "Care / Maintenance", and my code is var order = ['Brochures', 'Standard Sizing', 'Maintenance'];
[16:47:41] <awc737> ^ shoky
[16:48:22] <shoky> slashes shouldn't affect anything.. just remember .indexOf is case-sensitive and all that
[16:49:32] <awc737> hmm, it doesn't want to pick it up
[16:49:36] <awc737> the JSON it's searching is: "document_type_s":["Care \/ Maintenance"]
[16:50:14] <awc737> but 'Standard Sizing' is picking this up fine: "document_type_s":["Elevations \/ Sections","Standard Sizing"]
[16:50:14] <shoky> the question is what's in "docs" exactly
[16:50:32] <shoky> er
[16:50:40] <shoky> that's an array, not a string
[16:50:58] <awc737> so I need to match the entire value then
[16:51:55] <awc737> yeah, that worked
[16:51:58] <shoky> i guess that'd do it, yeah
[16:52:01] <awc737> I was thinking indexOf was like substr
[16:52:04] <awc737> (used to PHP)
[16:52:11] <shoky> depends if you call it on an array or a string..
[16:53:03] <awc737> oh ok, makes perfect sense
[16:53:12] <awc737> shoky, are you always this helpful
[16:54:33] <shoky> nope it's your lucky day
[16:54:47] <hyper33> i need some luck too
[16:55:18] <shoky> strive to deserve
[16:55:19] <tw2113> quick! shave a yack for luck
[16:55:37] <shoky> shave a yak??
[16:55:58] <tw2113> sounded good
[16:56:01] <tw2113> if i was from canada
[16:56:43] <shoky> i had some good yak in china
[16:57:02] <shoky> prolly unshaved.
[16:58:05] <Seth> hi there, I'm currently stuck with an issue while building a slideshow
[16:58:14] <Seth> I made an example here: http://surkow.dyndns.org/test/content/
[16:58:37] <Seth> I bind onclick events to play/pause
[16:59:53] <Seth> when changing the html from these buttons with basic jquery changes (            $(this).addClass('play');             $(this).get(0).innerHTML = '<div></div>';             $(this).animate({opacity: 1}, 400);)
[17:00:09] <Seth> all images turn to white
[17:00:11] <Seth> any ideas?
[17:03:24] <Gazpacho> maybe you frightened them
[17:24:54] <rpbo> How do you set a username when making a json request? Like curl -u username ?
[17:25:38] <jim_j> hi
[17:26:47] <jim_j> if I have three span classes with the same name 'arrow' how can I target the second 'arrow' class only?  this is giving me all three:  arrow = jQuery(this).find('.arrow');
[17:28:30] <beachandbytes> arrow = $(this).find('.arrow').eq(1);
[17:28:42] <jim_j> beachandbytes, thanks!

[17:41:23] <shwaiil> hi
[17:41:51] <shwaiil> Q: is there a way to prevent hashchange event from being triggered ? Tks
[17:44:30] <beachandbytes> I have a weird issue where a ajax Post is firing off a GET request as soon as it has finished the post. The entire body of the POST request goes into the address bar
[17:45:57] <coldhead> ?p @ beachandbytes
[17:45:58] <bot-t> beachandbytes, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:48:40] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/6TaTj/
[17:49:25] <beachandbytes> pretty basic post request
[17:49:54] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/6TaTj/1/
[17:50:05] <coldhead> you probably need to prevent the default form submission?
[17:50:11] <coldhead> hard to guess without the html
[17:50:27] <coldhead> but if you're seeing it in the address bar that sounds like a regular GET submit
[17:50:30] <coldhead> not a jQ thing
[17:51:47] <beachandbytes> perfect
[17:51:56] <beachandbytes> that fixed it
[17:52:32] <coldhead> huzzah!
[17:52:37] <coldhead> let's all take a short break then
[17:53:01] <beachandbytes> thats enough work for the day
[17:53:02] <beachandbytes> lol
[17:53:06] <coldhead> damn straight!

[18:04:22] <coldhead> strange strange strange little planet
[18:11:50] <royalty> hello
[18:12:05] <royalty> has anyone here gzipped data to make an ajax request go faster?
[18:12:55] <shwaiil> is there a way to unbind the hashchange or is there a way to change the hash without triggering this event ?!
[18:13:08] <royalty> basically in some cases I am feeding too much html into the request which I guess slows it down a lot so how do i gzip it serverside
[18:13:15] <royalty> then uncompress it with jquery
[18:13:19] <royalty> is that even possible?
[18:14:31] <melvinram> anyone know of a good plugin for query to do looping animation of things scrolling by horizontally?
[18:15:19] <coldhead> you mean an image carousel type dealy?
[18:15:56] <melvinram> coldhead: maybe. specifically, I want the logos on http://tentrental.net/  under the Featured Clients to scroll by. right now we have 10 and I'd like there to be 30 that can scroll by 10 visible at a time
[18:15:59] <burgers> royalslider is a good slider
[18:16:05] <coldhead> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/continuous.php
[18:16:26] <melvinram> coldhead: thank you sir!
[18:16:57] <coldhead> there are hundreds more, google will guide you if need be
[18:17:06] <coldhead> but cycle2 is a popular and easy option
[18:17:23] <melvinram> coldhead: the one you pointed to seems good enough
[18:17:39] <coldhead> royalty: that kind of zipping should be handled transparently by the browser and the server
[18:17:46] <coldhead> you shouldn't even have to know about it
[18:18:02] <royalty> coldhead: well, I need it...
[18:18:17] <coldhead> if your server is set up to do gzip then it should Just Work
[18:18:31] <royalty> I don't fully understand it
[18:18:31] <coldhead> jquery will get the unzipped data, you won't know it happened
[18:18:37] <royalty> I see
[18:19:08] <royalty> is there a way I can specify gzip this data on the server side
[18:19:19] <royalty> then throw it back on the web page
[18:19:36] <abjorn> coldhead: lawl
[18:20:24] <coldhead> royalty: you might need to set up your server to gzip data for you if it isn't already
[18:20:31] <coldhead> look at the output here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15097712/how-can-i-use-deflated-gzipped-content-with-an-xhr-onprogress-function
[18:20:46] <coldhead> if it's working you'll see "deflate" and "gzip" in the headers
[18:20:59] <coldhead> when you inspect the AJAX request with your debugger
[18:25:12] <royalty> coldhead: okay I'll look more into this tomorrow
[18:26:35] <coldhead> good luck, royalty
[18:26:38] <coldhead> i will never forget you
[18:26:49] <royalty> coldhead: heh thanks
[18:36:32] <four_tet> hi
[18:38:21] <coldhead> quite
[18:38:26] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[18:41:53] <coldhead> the kindness kind
[18:52:56] <lenswipee> hi, $('foo').addClass('bar') gives error when class bar is already there.
[18:53:57] <coldhead> no it doesn't
[18:54:20] <burgers> should it be $('.foo').addClass('bar')
[18:54:38] <burgers> the dot before foo maybe?
[18:54:50] <burgers> if you are targeting a class

[18:54:59] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/uEHQY/
[18:55:06] <lenswipee> coldhead: really? is there a point of checking if class is present first or it doesn't matter?
[18:55:13] <coldhead> god no
[18:55:16] <coldhead> just add it
[18:55:18] <coldhead> it works fine
[18:55:21] <coldhead> jquery don't care
[18:55:32] <lenswipee> coldhead: ok buddy
[18:55:44] <coldhead> if we knew the error you were seeing we could maybe help you figure out what's actually going wrong
[18:55:55] <coldhead> but it's definitely not what you are claiming it is
[18:56:04] <coldhead> sometimes i add the same class 500 times
[18:56:06] <coldhead> just for fun
[18:56:09] <lenswipee> coldhead: you're most probably right bro
[18:56:14] <coldhead> because i have a rich inner life
[18:56:25] <lenswipee> coldhead: yeah you are a cool dude
[18:56:38] <tw2113> Lifestyles of the rich and coldhead
[18:57:02] <lenswipee> he said rich inner life, not outer
[18:57:17] <tw2113> i said neither
[18:57:18] <coldhead> outwardly i am a hobo
[18:57:47] <tw2113> outwardly, you're a dingo
[18:58:07] <coldhead> it's the same thing
[18:58:47] <tw2113> if your last name is Chamberlain...look out!
[18:59:17] <coldhead> you know obscure things
[18:59:50] <tw2113> including the fact it was recently reopened due to new evidenc
[18:59:51] <tw2113> e
[19:00:33] <tw2113> i think it was the Simpsons that coined "a dingo ate my baby!"
[19:00:37] <tw2113> and i had to look up the reference
[19:01:16] <coldhead> thanks, simpsons
[19:01:28] <lenswipee> hi, consider this: if ( $('.foo') ) { $('.foo').addClass('bar'); }
[19:01:35] <lenswipee> can it be written as:
[19:01:41] <lenswipee> hi, consider this: if ( $('.foo') ) { $(this).addClass('bar'); }
[19:01:48] <lenswipee> ?
[19:02:16] <tw2113> lenswipee, it's not going to double class you
[19:02:20] <tw2113> so no need to check
[19:03:13] <coldhead> but also $( anything ) is always truthy
[19:03:24] <coldhead> so that if () is alwas going to happen
[19:03:48] <lenswipee> here is a beauty to ponder over coldhead.
[19:04:01] <coldhead> but also my fiddle! where i prove conclusively that it doesn't matter
[19:04:18] <coldhead> $('.aids').addClass('aids').addClass('aids').addClass('aids')
[19:04:20] <coldhead> NO PROBLEMO
[19:04:37] <coldhead> $.fn.aidsClass = $.fn.addClass, even
[19:04:44] <lenswipee> if ( $('input.required').val() == "" ) { do something } // if does not work on first input on form with many inputs of same class required.
[19:05:21] <coldhead> the main thng i am pondering here is what are you trying to do
[19:05:25] <lenswipee> and it does not apply to all inputs
[19:05:32] <coldhead> i'm also thinking about different cuts of meet
[19:05:34] <coldhead> meat*
[19:05:39] <coldhead> and bjork
[19:05:50] <lenswipee> check all input values / validation
[19:06:05] <lenswipee> if empty create an error
[19:06:08] <lenswipee> to display
[19:06:35] <coldhead> can't you use a validation plugin?
[19:06:42] <coldhead> so you don' thave to reinvent wheels?
[19:06:51] <coldhead> then you (and we) can all get on with our lives
[19:07:37] <lenswipee> first recommend me one and second lets talk about it some more because i think i can learn from this example.
[19:08:36] <lenswipee> do you need a test case coldhead?
[19:08:43] <coldhead> that would be exquisite, lenswipee
[19:08:50] <coldhead> i have shown men my boobs for less
[19:17:17] <lenswipee> hi, see http://jsfiddle.net/AAukz/
[19:20:01] <coldhead> lenswipee: you need to use ?each
[19:20:02] <bot-t> lenswipee, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:20:04] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/AAukz/1/
[19:20:13] <coldhead> because you're dealing with multiple elements in turn
[19:20:16] <vladikoff> yay
[19:20:49] <lenswipee> but doesn't $('.required') return all inputs?
[19:21:15] <coldhead> yes
[19:21:25] <coldhead> but what does val() return?
[19:21:27] <coldhead> all the values?
[19:21:31] <coldhead> or just A value
[19:21:38] <coldhead> anyway lenswipee, be lazier: http://jsfiddle.net/AAukz/2/
[19:21:44] <coldhead> you can make the browser do validation for you
[19:21:52] <coldhead> and you can use a shim to add validation in older browser
[19:21:54] <coldhead> s
[19:22:02] <coldhead> and we call all move on with our so-called lives
[19:23:01] <lenswipee> coldhead: so .val() returns just one value?
[19:23:08] <coldhead> yes
[19:23:21] <coldhead> which makes sense when you think about it
[19:23:25] <coldhead> if it returned all the values
[19:23:34] <coldhead> how would you know which element you were dealing with?
[19:23:46] <coldhead> i am surprised this is new information for you, lenswipee
[19:23:50] <coldhead> you've been doing this a while
[19:23:58] <lenswipee> coldhead: i have? how long?
[19:24:01] <coldhead> even *i* know these things
[19:24:05] <coldhead> and i am basically an idiot
[19:24:44] <lenswipee> coldhead: i have another question for you.
[19:24:58] <coldhead> i can scarecely believe it
[19:25:01] <coldhead> is it about women?
[19:25:11] <lenswipee> it's about jquery
[19:25:24] * coldhead feigns interest
[19:25:35] <lenswipee> consider: var $arr = []
[19:25:57] <lenswipee> how do i add a name index to it with a value
[19:26:33] <coldhead> $arr['aids'] = 'lol';
[19:26:45] <lenswipee> i am also happy to use an alternative data structure as long as i get the length of that structure
[19:27:02] <lenswipee> coldhead: that won't work
[19:28:06] <coldhead> ask someone who has a clue then
[19:28:13] <lenswipee> coldhead: you can only do $arr.push('lol')
[19:28:14] <coldhead> i am not your guy, clearly
[19:28:44] <coldhead> so you're asking how to do something with the constraint that i can only do it in one way which doesn't work?
[19:28:46] <coldhead> >_>
[19:29:30] <lenswipee> all i know is that $arr['aids'] = 'lol'; is invalid
[19:30:34] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/en9Ne/
[19:30:39] <hyper33>  Anyone have feedback on my issue  here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16326072/why-does-opening-a-dialog-too-early-fail-w-jquery-mobile-changepage ?
[19:30:45] <coldhead> that's how i'd store key value pairs in an array with push
[19:30:58] <coldhead> sucks to have to iterate to find an element by key but it's trivial
[19:33:07] <lenswipee> http://jsfiddle.net/en9Ne/1/, issue is that it can contain redundant elements
[19:33:13] <lenswipee> how to fix?
[19:36:19] <lenswipee> perhaps $arr['aids'] = 'lol' does work but the 'aids' index is not a true index as it allows for duplicate elements with the same index 'aids'.
[19:37:18] <lenswipee> basically i want to add error messages to an array, but if it's already there then it overwrites it so there are no duplicates.
[19:44:26] <coldhead> lenswipee: http://jsfiddle.net/en9Ne/3/
[19:49:01] <lenswipee> coldhead: interesting but it's more complex than i thought. I currently just use a flag to check if something has been added. I like the php array as it overwrites, not like JS
[19:49:32] <coldhead> i'm sure there are more elegant solutions
[19:49:41] <coldhead> i was just trying to give you something that worked
[19:49:45] <coldhead> so we could get on with out lives
[19:50:37] <coldhead> lenswipee: http://phpjs.org/functions/array/
[19:53:05] <lenswipee> coldhead: thanks. I got to go. Enjoy your day without me.
[19:53:14] <coldhead> i already am
[19:53:19] <coldhead> have a wonderful time lenswipee
[19:53:24] <lenswipee> lol
[19:54:54] <coldhead> you massive cretin
[20:17:25] <Third3ye> Hey there. Could anyone tell me why this scrolls all elements with the same class rather than just the individual parent?
[20:17:27] <Third3ye> http://hastebin.com/hewoteqeji.coffee
[20:18:12] <coldhead> Third3ye: you want $(this).parent()
[20:18:27] <coldhead> rightBtn.parent() returns ALL the parents of all the buttons
[20:18:33] <coldhead> so they all scroll
[20:18:48] <coldhead> actually that still won't work
[20:18:59] <coldhead> because this will change witthin the setTimeout
[20:19:16] <Third3ye> I noticed...
[20:19:58] <coldhead> http://hastebin.com/gikivupeme.coffee
[20:20:21] <coldhead> oh and i just noticed you used rightbtn again
[20:20:27] <coldhead> so change all those to that
[20:31:43] <Third3ye> coldhead: worked like a charm :) Thanks
[20:35:06] <innociv> Are there any plugins to allow setting transform: translateZ(foo);?
[20:35:56] <innociv> nevermind I can with just css() rofl
[20:36:18] <coldhead> man, i thought there was some complex reason why that wouldn't work which i was wracking my brain for
[20:39:03] <innociv> Well I'd have liked to use css({translateZ: number}); because it would add to what's already there.
[20:39:27] <innociv> setting it with '-webkit-transform' requires me to repeat it for every case and give the entire line for each transform, afaik.
[20:41:24] <innociv> But enough of that, coldhead, any suggestions on how I should go about making a sort of sphere with 3d transforms?  A square of rectangles, that is.  Obviously the ones further from the equater are going to be smaller.  But they also need to be trapazoid shaped.
[20:43:01] <coldhead> innociv: this is the limit of my knowledge of CSS transforms http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos
[20:43:21] <coldhead> i've created triangles out of rectangles with masking and rotation
[20:43:31] <innociv> Neat
[20:43:32] <coldhead> you probably want to talk to #css
[20:43:36] <innociv> Yeah probably
[20:43:43] <coldhead> shit is gomblex
[20:43:43] <innociv> But #css is often full of dumb.
[20:44:02] <innociv> "run it through the validator, mannnn"
[20:44:11] <innociv> "run it through the validator 10 more times"
[20:44:36] <coldhead> fair point
[20:44:44] <coldhead> we could use more of that folksy wisdom in here
[20:49:57] <innociv> http://jsbin.com/iwuroc/2/edit :(
[21:07:14] <innociv> What is the math to normalize a vector?
[21:11:11] <vladikoff> innociv, https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/math/Vector3.js#L435
[21:11:46] <innociv> I just figured i can probably add depth+height, and then divide the difference from depth, right?
[21:13:36] <gnarf> innociv: its the vec / veg.magnitude
[21:13:56] <innociv> dem words :<
[21:13:59] <gnarf> think 2d vector
[21:14:03] <gnarf> triangle
[21:14:18] <gnarf> Math.sqrt( a*a + b*b )
[21:14:33] <gnarf> Math.sqrt( x*x + y*y + z*z )
[21:14:37] <gnarf> that is the "length
[21:14:51] <gnarf> divide each part of the vector by that you get normalized
[21:15:05] <Stephen> coldhead: late, but good news
[21:15:16] <Stephen> I don't know if it's jquery or jqueryui
[21:15:17] <workmeh> is it possible to customize jquery-mobile's look to anything i want, as with any css?
[21:15:39] <Stephen> but adding css properties using .css() will handle the prefixing automatically
[21:16:03] <Stephen> workmeh: to a point, yes
[21:16:40] <Stephen> workmeh: Trying to get too far out of the provided layouts/shape isn't going to work out well on mobile
[21:17:18] <Stephen> But if you stick to just the controls in a View List type fashion you should be fine
[21:18:19] <workmeh> Stephen: i mainly want to know if the ui it provides limits me to what i've seen in the examples, e.g., lots of rounded buttons
[21:21:58] <workmeh> Stephen: is there a general guideline for knowing when to choose jquery mobile over jquery ui for creating an app that works on mobile and web?
[21:27:50] <innociv> Oh youre' right it does, stephen
[21:32:57] <innociv> Is there a plugin that makes this easier? I'm trying to arrange boxes in a sphere.
[21:33:40] <Stephen> workmeh: Yes, if you support blackberry, avoid jquery-ui
[21:34:14] <Stephen> innociv: Arranging boxes in a sphere?hmm
[21:34:25] <coldhead> the big issues
[21:34:39] <Stephen> innociv: try three.js
[21:34:47] <innociv> I thought that's for webgl stuff?
[21:35:17] <Stephen> Lets see
[21:35:35] <innociv> Seems it doesn't just do that..
[21:35:44] <innociv> Don't see many non-canvas and non-webgl examples though
[21:35:51] <Stephen> Pi*radius^3
[21:36:28] <Stephen> You're just building consecutive 3d circles
[21:37:40] <coldhead> the problem is simplified if you redefine a circle to be a square
[21:38:27] <innociv> http://jsbin.com/iwuroc/2/edit is what I have right now
[21:38:53] <Stephen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155649/circle-coordinates-to-array-in-javascript
[21:40:00] <innociv> That's circle not a sphere
[21:40:25] <Stephen> Ah, you are tilting panels with css
[21:40:29] <Stephen> I misunderstood
[21:40:30] <innociv> I need the pixel distance for the z(from center) and y(up/down).
[21:41:19] <innociv> I have the distance from the center, var tz, which is 220px when I have 9 160px width panels.
[21:41:24] <Stephen> Just add a third line to it for z
[21:41:57] <innociv> I don't know what to change the distances to for z and y when going up and down from the equator
[21:42:25] <Stephen> Basically the panels are overlapping
[21:42:29] <Stephen> yeah, give me a sec
[21:42:31] <innociv> Yes
[21:42:45] <Stephen> So, you have a preset number of panels, yes?
[21:43:21] <Stephen> Ok, first off, save yourself some confusion
[21:43:44] <innociv> It should be something like translate3d(0px, 33px, 207px) not translate3d(0px, 92.63157894736842px, 220px)
[21:43:50] <innociv> While the equator is translate3d(0px, 0, 220px)
[21:43:51] <Stephen> distance from the center should be a name related to "radius", not z
[21:45:07] <innociv> Well distance from center is y,z, not just z.
[21:45:12] <innociv> It's just z when it's the equator
[21:47:18] <innociv> need the y and z that's equal to the distance from the center with the angle(40 in this case) factored in
[21:47:51] <innociv> Euclidean vector?
[21:51:01] <Stephen> Sorry, needed to refresh my reading right quik
[21:52:03] <Stephen> Alright, so 9 panels
[21:52:06] <Stephen> in a sphere
[21:52:20] <Stephen> It's not gonna be a sphere
[21:52:23] <Stephen> more like a ring
[21:52:27] <Stephen> But here it goes:
[21:52:57] * coldhead 's breath is bated
[21:53:06] <Stephen> It would be better to have an even number
[21:53:08] <Stephen> Why 9?
[21:53:17] <innociv> it shouldn't really matter.
[21:53:24] <Stephen> Actually, it does
[21:53:26] <innociv> I need a dynamic number of them.
[21:53:33] <innociv> Needs to work on odd numbers :x
[21:53:55] <Stephen> Think about this: To draw it right, there needs to be a polygon for the top and bottom poles
[21:54:12] <innociv> It shouldn't be too complicated to find the y and z distance to move 220 units from the center at 30 degrees.  I just don't know what the formula is.
[21:54:34] <Stephen> Of course not:
[21:54:51] <innociv> There will be triangles at the top and bottom.
[21:55:11] <Stephen> Ergh?
[21:55:12] <Stephen> Ok
[21:55:21] <innociv> Or most likely, I just won't do the top and bottom.
[21:55:52] <wilkinsmc> i've never delved into server side languages, but all I need is a form that visitors can fill out that dumps what's filled in to a .txt or email address on send. Any good plugins or tutorials for such?
[21:57:30] <wilkinsmc> think i just found one
[21:57:44] <innociv> Meh or really, I need a better way to represent this.
[21:58:02] <innociv> It's for a game where I have areas that the player walks on. But then I need a larger map showing all the areas.
[21:59:28] <Stephen> innociv: You'll notice as # panels increases your overlap goes away
[21:59:31] <wilkinsmc> you making it iwth xna?
[21:59:42] <innociv> No.  Javascript.
[21:59:59] <innociv> If I was doing unity or something, it'd be easy. Sure.
[22:08:42] <wilkinsmc> well then
[22:08:56] <wilkinsmc> glad i convinced you to change platforms
[22:10:13] <innociv> http://www.joelblancoberg.com/solarsystem/ Neat.
[22:10:19] <innociv> Also, wat?
[22:13:46] <davidmahoney> hey guys
[22:14:35] <davidmahoney> say I had multiple pictures in a array and wanted to move them around graphical how would I go about doing that
[22:16:28] <coldhead> open photoshop, click and drag
[22:25:06] <wilkinsmc> you guys ever hear that song that's like
[22:25:20] <wilkinsmc> i got so many, braw braw braw, bitches, braw braw braw, braw braw braw
[22:27:03] <raj> if I have two click listeners for an element, and one of them just has a `return`, does the other not get executed?
[22:27:24] <coldhead> no, they will both run
[22:27:24] <Cork> return false; breaks the event loop yes
[22:27:31] <raj> hmm
[22:27:33] <raj> k
[22:27:34] <Cork> just return is fine though
[22:27:37] <coldhead> hes returning undefined!
[22:28:40] <innociv> http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/globe/ this looks neat
[22:30:39] <raj> damn, I waste my time on such stupid mistakes
[22:31:14] <raj> I had '.some-group > button' instead of '.some-group button'
[22:32:46] <coldhead> oh raj
[22:32:50] <coldhead> will you ever learn? :P
[22:33:02] <Third3ye> :P
[22:33:20] <davidmahoney> anyone have experience with sortable
[22:33:29] <raj> probably not
[22:33:37] <Third3ye> I used .next().next() on an action -- but is there a better way of doing this? .next().next() just looks ugly...
[22:33:40] <raj> davidmahoney, many people do
[22:33:44] <raj> what's up?
[22:33:46] <Third3ye> Perhaps next(2) works...
[22:34:01] <Cork> nextAll().eq(2)
[22:34:03] <raj> Third3ye, nextUntil
[22:34:22] <raj> no, that's all the elements
[22:34:39] <davidmahoney> raj: I am looking at http://jqueryui.com/sortable/ so after the list is sorted or whatever is there some kind of callback or function to get the new order
[22:34:39] <raj> Third3ye, you can do .siblings('.someselector')
[22:34:40] <track7> any ajax developers here?
[22:34:52] <Cork> raj: that goes both up and down
[22:35:01] <raj> oh, yes
[22:35:02] <wilkinsmc> anyone use ajax? i'm using a jquery form plugin, and when i hit "submit" i get the error, "The HTTP verb POST used to access path '/AmiableWeb - Current - Smaller Intro - Copy/comment.php' is not allowed."
[22:35:19] <Cork> davidmahoney: is the elements of different types?
[22:35:31] <coldhead> wilkinsmc: does it work if you use GET instead of POST?
[22:35:33] <Cork> you could select based on a class for example
[22:35:37] <coldhead> if so then do that
[22:35:46] <davidmahoney> so I want to do this with picture so user can put them in whatever order they want
[22:35:57] <raj> wilkinsmc, you're not accepting a POST request?
[22:36:08] <Cork> davidmahoney: so nextAll('img').eq(2)
[22:36:18] <Cork> opps that's the third
[22:36:20] <Cork> davidmahoney: so nextAll('img').eq(1)
[22:36:24] <raj> nice Cork
[22:36:24] <davidmahoney> so I have all the pictures in a array which I have to put them ul which is fine
[22:36:36] <davidmahoney> so once they are done moving them around
[22:36:55] <davidmahoney> .eq()
[22:37:06] <Cork> ?.eq
[22:37:06] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[22:37:28] <davidmahoney> nextAll I am googling it all
[22:37:33] <davidmahoney> *it now
[22:37:39] <Cork> ?.nextAll
[22:37:39] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[22:37:40] <wilkinsmc> this is the first time i'm using ajax :P just want a simple form on my page
[22:38:21] <wilkinsmc> coding through visual studio
[22:38:51] <davidmahoney> so say my Div id is like sortable I would for nextall('sortable)
[22:39:19] <Cork> davidmahoney: no, id pointless to select through relative
[22:39:27] <Cork> just do $('#sortable')
[22:39:41] <Cork> and id is by definition uniq on the page
[22:40:07] <davidmahoney> $('sortable').nextAll() will give me the new order
[22:40:15] <davidmahoney> well #sortable
[22:40:22] <Haprog> unless the id might be in different places depending on page and you want different behaviour :P
[22:40:34] <Cork> $('#sortable') not sortable
[22:40:38] <Cork> sortable would be an element
[22:40:51] <wilkinsmc> figured it out. My id name was different in jquery than in html
[22:40:55] <davidmahoney> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#default given this example
[22:40:56] <wilkinsmc> don't help me any more :P
[22:41:33] <davidmahoney> to get the new order it would be var newlist = $('#sortable').nextAll()
[22:41:58] <Cork> no
[22:42:07] <Cork> sounds like your looking for children not siblings
[22:42:22] <Cork> $('#sortable').children()
[22:42:38] <davidmahoney> I was thinking there would be a callback or something to do something with the newlist
[22:43:02] <Cork> $('#sortable').children().hide()
[22:43:11] <Cork> why would there be a callback?
[22:43:32] <davidmahoney> one the user moves the elements around do something
[22:43:40] <davidmahoney> *once the user
[22:43:56] <Cork> there is no way to know when elements are moved
[22:44:08] <Cork> sortable has handlers for it though
[22:44:14] <davidmahoney> so how do you know the new order them
[22:44:37] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update
[22:45:07] <davidmahoney> say have image 1,2,3,4,5 the user makes 3,4,5,1,2 how would i update my array on the backend
[22:45:57] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update <--
[22:47:16] <davidmahoney> that is what I was looking for I just have to find a demo
[22:51:08] <wilkinsmc> hmmm, not sure what i have to do to access the data sent from the form. Just want to be able to read what people add using the form
[22:51:27] <Cork> ?.serialize @ wilkinsmc
[22:51:27] <bot-t> wilkinsmc, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[22:51:43] <coldhead> i would go for a giant electronic billboard that shows the text in real time
[22:51:52] <coldhead> a classy addition to any foyer
[22:51:53] <Cork> $.post('url', $(this).serialize())
[22:52:56] <wilkinsmc> ty
[22:53:16] <antiPoP> hi
[22:53:29] <antiPoP> i'm trying to select an element by an event call
[22:53:31] <antiPoP> #documentChooser ul li a[onClick=loadDocument('78787878')
[22:53:52] <antiPoP> owever jquery says it's an unrecognized expression
[22:54:18] <Cork> $('a[onClick="loadDocument(\'78787878\')"]')
[22:54:27] <davidmahoney> Hey Cork check this out
[22:55:24] <davidmahoney> so want to make that a ordered list right
[22:55:35] <davidmahoney> instead of appending
[22:55:57] <Cork> ?
[22:56:11] <Cork> so bind an event handler for when sortable has moved an element
[22:56:19] <Cork> in the event handler grab the new sort order
[22:56:31] <davidmahoney> ya right now sortable is not being used in the jsfiddle
[22:56:37] <davidmahoney> http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/
[22:56:42] <davidmahoney>  that might help haha
[22:57:06] <Cork> well if you're not using sortable the user can't change the order so...
[22:57:27] <davidmahoney> i know I am about to add put I don't want to add like I am doing right
[22:57:34] <davidmahoney> I don't want to use append
[22:57:55] <davidmahoney> wow sorry horrible english
[22:58:10] <Cork> ok, so how do you want to do it then?
[22:58:18] <davidmahoney> I don't want to use append or do I have make a ul  then right
[22:58:40] <Cork> sortable doens't depend on ul/li elements
[22:58:54] <davidmahoney> oh okay
[22:59:42] <Cork> davidmahoney: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-items
[22:59:45] <bluesm> Should I use ".on" or ".delegate"
[22:59:52] <bluesm> If I want to delegate events ?
[22:59:57] <Cork> blueadept: it's up to you
[23:00:21] <Cork> it's the same thing in the backend, so you can use what you want
[23:00:26] <davidmahoney> Cork check this out http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/1/
[23:00:48] <Cork> ok?
[23:00:48] <davidmahoney> why does it do that funky thing when I move it around
[23:01:13] <davidmahoney> the box gets longer
[23:02:23] <bluesm> Cork: blueadept ?
[23:03:05] <Cork> bluesm: opps wrong nick, sorry
[23:03:27] <Cork> davidmahoney: well you're depending on table-cell, and not sure that works when it's hovering
[23:03:49] <davidmahoney> how would I cahngeit
[23:04:01] <davidmahoney> *change it my typing is horrible tonight
[23:04:23] <Cork> use padding instead
[23:04:39] <davidmahoney> sorry new css
[23:05:46] <davidmahoney> change this display: table-cell;   to what
[23:06:00] <Cork> padding: 10px for example
[23:06:48] <davidmahoney> just add that into the css
[23:08:35] <innociv> So.. if i'm going 220 units from a point, at 30 degrees, what is the x and y translation for that distance?
[23:09:26] <tw2113> oh shit, we're in math class at the moment
[23:10:10] <Cork> innociv: what on earth does that have to do with jquery?
[23:10:54] <tw2113> it's math, man
[23:10:56] <tw2113> math
[23:11:01] <Cork> so?
[23:11:03] <davidmahoney> Cork never mind the css how would I get the new order with JQuery
[23:11:08] <tw2113> that class i skipped to get high
[23:11:18] <davidmahoney> in the update function I was thinking about each on the selector
[23:11:25] <Cork> davidmahoney: $(this).children() like i said before
[23:11:35] <tw2113> not really, never smoked the pan before
[23:11:36] <Cork> or you could use $(this).serialize()
[23:11:40] <tw2113> but i'm feeling dramatic
[23:12:03] <davidmahoney> var temp = $(this).children(); like this then
[23:12:25] <davidmahoney> temp would be the new list
[23:12:47] <Cork> it would be the list of dom elements
[23:13:22] <innociv> cork, javascript?
[23:13:28] <coldhead> i miss temp01
[23:13:28] <innociv> math?
[23:13:38] <Cork> innociv: so ##javascript then
[23:13:42] <innociv> Lmao
[23:14:47] <sacho> innociv, there is a ##math channel
[23:15:01] <sacho> But this is pretty easy.
[23:15:02] <wilkinsmc> i know html, css, and javascript, but i know nothing about forms. I just want to learn how to send form data and retrieve it on my end. Best tutorials?
[23:15:15] <wilkinsmc> i know nothing about PHP*
[23:15:21] <sacho> wilkinsmc, which end is your end?
[23:15:27] <Cork> wilkinsmc: you got how to send it
[23:15:40] <Cork> and just handle it like normal post data in php
[23:15:47] <Cork> if you need help with it ##php
[23:16:12] <davidmahoney> is there a console in jsfiddle
[23:16:40] <Cork> no
[23:17:07] <davidmahoney> i want to see what is in temp a alert won't do it
[23:17:32] <Cork> console.log
[23:17:37] <sacho> innociv, the x would be (+-)220*cos(30) and y would be (+-)220*sin(3). Draw it on a piece of paper and remember your basic trigonometry, you'll easily see why.
[23:17:37] <Cork> and use the console in the browser
[23:19:46] <davidmahoney> and how i get the id of the children
[23:19:52] <davidmahoney> a list of ids
[23:20:18] <Cork> $.map($(this).children(), function() { return this.id; })
[23:20:20] <akurilin> Hey folks, quick DataTables question. Is there any way of preventing it from caching each table cell at initialization and instead have it load them each time from the DOM?
[23:20:33] <raj> can I catch ctrl + V on keypress?
[23:20:52] <Cork> yes
[23:21:00] <raj> doesn't seem to work
[23:21:04] <Cork> check the event object for ctrl information
[23:21:09] <raj> I am
[23:21:13] <raj> but it just pastes
[23:21:22] <davidmahoney> that didn't work cork temp was empty
[23:21:23] <raj> it never hits my debugger if I use 'ctrl'
[23:21:43] <raj> I can catch Ctrl+B for example
[23:21:47] <raj> but not Ctrl+V
[23:21:54] <raj> although I can catch V by itself
[23:22:05] <Cork> davidmahoney: where are you running the selector?
[23:22:20] <davidmahoney> http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/3/
[23:22:39] <raj> I'm in chrome, btw
[23:24:13] <Cork> raj: or are you trying to grab this on ex. a textarea?
[23:24:22] <Cork> of so then you need to use onpaste
[23:25:43] <raj> nice Cork!
[23:25:45] <raj> never heard of that
[23:26:17] <davidmahoney> Cork do you know how I would edit to get that list of ids
[23:26:26] <raj> Cork, how can i get the value of the paste?
[23:27:55] <davidmahoney> i can parse through temp I guess
[23:28:15] <antiPoP> I'm trying this regex
[23:28:17] <antiPoP> "a".match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_+-\s]+$/)
[23:28:36] <antiPoP> but it says yntaxError: invalid range in character class
[23:28:41] <Cork> oh, ya
[23:28:42] <antiPoP> what is wrong?
[23:28:48] <Cork> forgot that map doesn't set this
[23:29:10] <Cork> davidmahoney: http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/4/
[23:29:36] <davidmahoney> nice Cork thank you
[23:29:47] <Cork> ?eval "a".match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_+\-\\s]+$/)
[23:29:50] <bot-t> Cork: ["a"]
[23:30:46] <Cork> wait what is \s in regex?
[23:30:53] <Cork> space?
[23:30:53] <davidmahoney> okay now for the big question say I have a array 1,2,3,4 and then the update function return the order 4,2,3,1 is there quick I switch the other array to that order
[23:31:16] <Cork> ?eval " ".match(/^[\s]+$/)
[23:31:17] <bot-t> Cork: [" "]
[23:31:26] <Cork> ?eval "\t".match(/^[\s]+$/)
[23:31:27] <bot-t> Cork: ["\t"]
[23:31:29] <Cork> ah
[23:32:00] <Cork> davidmahoney: just replace the original array
[23:32:48] <davidmahoney> I can cause the other arry would have the pictures and data in there
[23:32:54] <davidmahoney> *i can't
[23:33:11] <Cork> davidmahoney: then user each instead of map and do it there
[23:33:25] <kevireillyy> who just asked about the array sorting?
[23:33:32] <davidmahoney> tI did
[23:33:40] <davidmahoney> I can't type at all tonight
[23:33:58] <davidmahoney> Cork: what do you mean
[23:35:04] <kevireillyy> >>[3,4,1,2].sort(function(a, b){ return a - b; });
[23:35:08] <kevireillyy> woops
[23:35:44] <davidmahoney> huh?
[23:36:22] <kevireillyy> i wish my scrollback worked, you were looking to make a jumbled array order be an ascending order or am i twippin
[23:37:22] <davidmahoney> no hold on
[23:38:57] <davidmahoney> kevireillyy console.log(myarray);
[23:39:07] <davidmahoney> http://jsfiddle.net/ytBqG/5/
[23:39:11] <davidmahoney> sorry there
[23:39:20] <davidmahoney> you see myarray
[23:40:01] <davidmahoney> once the user moves the photo around I want my array order to match the new order
[23:41:37] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: ah, gotcha.. got it figured out? seems like its doing dat
[23:41:39] <davidmahoney> i think there is probably a easy way to do
[23:41:57] <davidmahoney> its not doing that at all haha
[23:42:19] <innociv> sacho, well on a piece of paper I can aproximate it, yes. But why is y *sin(3)?  So I know for other angles
[23:42:25] <kevireillyy> i move 6 to the front, console log is now 6 at index 0
[23:42:45] <davidmahoney> that is the children not my array
[23:43:18] <innociv> I also don't think 220*sin(3) is correct.
[23:43:19] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: but you want the same order reflected in your myarray?
[23:43:28] <davidmahoney> yes
[23:43:34] <innociv> do you mean 30?
[23:43:36] <innociv> That makes sense then
[23:43:38] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: myarray = temp; // i suppose
[23:44:27] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: or just myarray = $.map($(this).children(), function(elm) { return elm.id; });
[23:44:49] <davidmahoney> that would erase the data in the array
[23:45:07] <sacho> innociv, yes
[23:45:21] <sacho> innociv, you can do more than approximate it :)
[23:45:56] <innociv> How so? But those numbers look close enough
[23:46:16] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: i'm confused.. so you want myarray to be the same arrya and ordering as temp, but you dont want to overwrite myarray?
[23:46:29] <davidmahoney> exactly
[23:46:39] <davidmahoney> just in the same order
[23:47:35] <raj> why doesn't jquery's 'paste' event carry this information?--> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6035265/997624
[23:48:03] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: and thats different than setting myarray to the value of temp, how? there seems to be something you're leaving out
[23:48:34] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: or you just need a new global variable to set the value of temp to
[23:49:15] <wilkinsmc> so to see the result of using php for a local site on my computer i need to install a web server on my pc?
[23:49:15] <davidmahoney> so say myarray has bunch of data in it the user want to move this data in certain order they move it arround with ui and now I have to update the data array
[23:51:42] <bluesm> event data
[23:51:52] <bluesm> is used for sending the same data to all handlers ?
[23:52:17] <kevireillyy> davidmahoney: ah, gotcha. so myarray is really like an array of objects or something?
[23:52:25] <davidmahoney> yup
[23:54:01] <resting> in :nth-child(3n+1), what does 3n+1 mean?
[23:54:24] <resting> 3*(total children) + 1?
[23:55:56] <innociv> sacho, are you sure that's correct? the difference between cos(30) and cos(40) is really huge
[23:56:23] <innociv> and doesn't look how I'd expect
[23:56:43] <coldhead> it means 3n + 1 for n = 1, 2, 3, 4
[23:57:16] <davidmahoney> Cork toArray  works too
[23:58:15] <sacho> innociv, I don't know what you're talking about
[23:58:45] <innociv> Math.cos(30) = 0.15425144988758405  Math.cos(40) = -0.6669380616522619
[23:59:12] <sacho> those aren't degrees.
[23:59:18] <sacho> what's the parameter for Math.cos()?
[23:59:33] <innociv> 30 isn't a degree?
[23:59:42] <raj> radian maybe
[23:59:43] <sacho> what's the parameter for Math.cos()?
