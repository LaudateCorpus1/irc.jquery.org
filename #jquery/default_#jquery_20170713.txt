[03:20:04] <IamTrying> $.post("https://www.iamGoogle.com/ajax", { name: "Linus" }, function(data) {}, "json"); - is this Plain text or Secured submit because HTTPS? (i was asked in a meeting)
[03:20:36] <Cork> IamTrying: uh its https...
[03:20:56] <IamTrying> Cork: i was asked can a network hacker now sniff that name = Linus ?
[03:21:03] <Cork> the S should make that question quite clear
[03:21:46] <IamTrying> So we are safe, its encrypted Cork
[03:22:08] <IamTrying> when its HTTP(not S) then its plain text i believe right Cork?
[03:22:28] <Cork> the transfer between the browser and the server front end is encrypted yes
[03:22:41] <Cork> and i'm not sure if your joking or not...
[03:23:24] <IamTrying> Thank you guru Cork
[03:23:39] <Cork> IamTrying: http://www.acronymfinder.com/HTTPS.html
[03:24:11] <IamTrying> Thank you
[05:53:49] <Atrag> Hi. Can someone please explain why  $grid.find(".grid-item").style.visibility="hidden"; would return "Cannot set property 'visibility' of undefined" where as "$grid.find(".grid-item").hide();" works fine?
[06:03:42] <Uhkis> because that jquery object doesnt have style property
[06:08:03] <Atrag> ok. so if I just add style="" to the div it should work?
[06:15:45] <larsk> Hey
[06:41:18] <localh0st> Atrag: $grid.find(".grid-item").style.visibility="hidden"; -> $grid.find(".grid-item").css("visibility", "hidden");
[06:59:41] <AdamPDotty> plus you should avoid using style
[07:20:45] <Atrag> localh0st: thanks
[08:04:32] <Nece228> hey guys, i want to transfer my values from html to javascript array, i made a code but it doest work...
[08:04:33] <Nece228> https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/1/
[08:07:33] <Nece228> would be even better if go_live_date_array would be they key, and live_customers_array would be the value in an array
[08:09:14] <Uhkis> Nece228: t and vals are both undefined
[08:13:08] <Nece228> https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/4/
[08:13:20] <Nece228> Uhkis: ok i updated code for now but it still doesnt work
[08:14:18] <Uhkis> Nece228: https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/5/ this is probably what you wanted
[08:15:12] <MikeD_> if you have classes on the items you want to be addressable/named, by not use them?
[08:16:36] <Nece228> Uhkis: thanks a lot! thats what i needed
[08:18:24] <MikeD_> ex: https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/6/
[08:30:07] <adv_> taplar are you here
[08:30:07] <adv_> ?
[08:32:41] <Nece228> Uhkis: i have another question, how do i increment the value each time? so if in the first one it is no 1, and the second is no 3, then when it loops through the second row, it would show 4 (1+3=4)? https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/7/
[08:34:41] <Cork> Nece228: grab the i from the .each loop?
[08:35:45] <Nece228> Cork: i think im doing that with converted_int?
[08:36:19] <Cork> Nece228: it grabs the number from graph-col-live-customers
[08:36:55] <Cork> Nece228: what exactly is it you're trying to do?
[08:37:03] <Cork> sum up the customers value?
[08:38:23] <sopparus> if I have <button id="send">
[08:38:40] <sopparus> how do I reach with something like $('button.send').click(function(){
[08:39:11] <Cork> sopparus: use a class instead of an id
[08:39:17] <sopparus> ok
[08:39:21] <sopparus> then # instead of . ?
[08:39:30] <Cork> if you want id instead of class ya
[08:39:32] <Nece228> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/8/ i added comments
[08:40:01] <Cork> Nece228: ya, i know what you're trying to do, my question was why
[08:40:11] <Cork> (the reason i asked is cause it might be a better way to do it)
[08:40:16] <adv_> i'm going nuts, something working on jsfiddle doesn't work on my testbed
[08:40:32] <Nece228> Cork: im just making a google chart, which would show the timeline and the amount of customers are at that time
[08:40:35] <sopparus> doesnt work with class="send"
[08:40:39] <adv_> same exact thing
[08:40:40] <sopparus> and button#send
[08:40:56] <Cork> Nece228: and the value you just added is for?
[08:41:04] <Cork> sopparus: do one of the changes not both
[08:41:29] <Nece228> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/wupcj8dL/ if you see here, i want to add that array where the data.addRows is
[08:41:36] <Cork> if you do both you will end up in exactly the same situation just reversed
[08:41:57] <Cork> ah
[08:42:48] <Cork> Nece228: https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/9/ ?
[08:43:20] <Cork> that will sum up the values for each date, if that is what you're trying to do
[08:44:39] <Cork> Nece228: and to match the output https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/10/
[08:44:44] <Nece228> Cork: yeah you are right, but my database is a little messed up. so it outputs the number of live customers which are in that date, without taking into consideration previous or future dates
[08:44:59] <Nece228> so in one day i might get two clients, but it doesnt output the sum
[08:45:05] <Cork> ah, so you want to sum the results
[08:45:10] <Nece228> yes
[08:45:23] <Cork> hmm, that becomes a little trickier, cause that means you have to sort the result first
[08:46:29] <Nece228> Cork: yes, but sorting shouldnt be the problem. i just need to find a way to add up on each loop
[08:53:29] <Cork> Nece228: so https://jsfiddle.net/up1y08oh/11/ ?
[08:53:34] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/cr9obrt8/embedded/result/ , http://www.augmentedperformance.com/index_mob5.php , identical code produces different results (the case at jsfiddle works as expected, the other doesn't) . i have a single console.log and while on jsfiddle it prints out as the elements appear on the viewport, on the production site it prints them out all at once. so i get 2 print statements on jsfiddle and 114 on the production site. any ideas?
[08:55:32] <Nece228> Cork: thanks, but how about the i add the sum on each of the looped values? so the second value would be 8 instead of 5?
[08:55:53] <Cork> Nece228: it does that
[08:56:09] <Cork> line 11
[08:57:01] <Nece228> Cork: hmm it doesnt show me that in console..
[08:57:59] <Cork> sure it does
[08:58:06] <Cork> 3 + 2 == 5
[08:58:11] <Cork> 5 + 5 == 10
[08:59:45] <Nece228> Cork: ah i see, you sorted the order of the date. Ok Thanks a lot!
[09:00:06] <Nece228> the sorting is going to be done automatically but nevermind!
[09:00:21] <Cork> Nece228: if you don't need the sorting you can remove the .sort()
[09:00:36] <Cork> but the customer calculation depends on the dates being in order
[09:00:39] <Cork> or it will be wrong
[09:02:31] <Nece228> Cork: yeah i see it! But it will be fine because im filtering the sql entries by date anyway
[09:02:41] <Nece228> thanks a ton, i thought it would be really hard to me..
[09:02:45] <Cork> ordering you mean :)
[09:02:53] <Cork> but ya, then you want to remove the sort
[09:03:07] <MikeD_> if your database can't do sorting and counting you should get a new database
[09:03:24] <Cork> :D
[09:06:03] <adv_> Cork, can you help?
[09:07:22] <TViernion> If i have a $('html code here').appendto('#divID');  how would i go about also loading, or including a .php file in with that?
[09:08:38] <localh0st> TViernion: you mean PHP code or PHP html response?
[09:09:15] <TViernion> code that will run and render properly, so i'm gessing code.
[09:09:19] <localh0st> if you are thinking of PHP code - you can't include it, because you're operating on DOM elements only
[09:10:06] <TViernion> would ajax be the better way to call and include then?
[09:10:07] <localh0st> if you have PHP script that returns some value like HTML code, you can use append() to add it to the browser's view
[09:10:43] <localh0st> TViernion: I don't quiet understand what are you trying to include, give me some example
[09:11:00] <TViernion> http://dev2.42iso.com/mms_angular/dev/test_tab.php
[09:11:44] <TViernion> when you click on "add Tab" it does just that, adds the tab.  But when the new tab is added (eventually) it might pull something like customer details, or a product detail, and of course that will need to bring with it all the details of that product/customer.
[09:13:17] <TViernion> So i am going to need to pass some type of parameters through the "add tab" and turn into variables that can be called with the load... i just am looking for the best way to call the include so it will run the scripts and load the proper information
[09:14:31] <localh0st> ok, simplest way to achieve that would be:
[09:15:56] <Nece228> Cork: just one last question, is it possible to convert one array into multiple, so the output would: ['2016-5-5', 1],   ['2017-6-6', 2] instead of ['2016-5-5', 1,   '2017-6-6', 2]
[09:16:35] <localh0st> 1. clicking on tab you passing some ID of client to backend php script via ajax call 2. in backend you're getting data from db, you're preparing table html with client's details 3. you're getting ajax response with the html table 4. you're calling jquery method to replace your container html with your table data like $("#container").html(ajaxResponse);
[09:17:58] <localh0st> or your php backend could also return, let's say, json object with the data, and you can operate on your html elements that are already visible and you can replace od append json's values to your html view
[09:21:29] <TViernion> okay... so basically pass the variable to a script that runs completely back end .. that script generates the code, and then use jquery to replace the container (probably a <div id="target_container">)  about have it correctly
[09:21:55] <localh0st> TViernion: exactly
[09:22:46] <TViernion> okay... now if i just wanted to return html from a php file in the append as part of html?
[09:24:10] <TViernion> here is one of the append lines https://pastebin.com/JDH4h03h
[09:25:21] <localh0st> TViernion: This is a private paste. If you created this paste, please login to view it.
[09:25:39] <localh0st> make it public
[09:25:39] <TViernion> refresh, i pasted the wrong append.  what i'm also looking for is for it to include a php file where it says <p>TheNewTab</p>
[09:25:42] <TViernion> i changed it.
[09:25:47] <TViernion> i thought i had made it public...
[09:33:06] <TViernion> did it work that time localh0sT?
[09:35:43] <codecutter> need to find a table row (tr) with data attr 'foo'
[09:35:56] <codecutter> table has class 'bar'
[09:38:53] <codecutter> anyone?
[09:42:18] <codecutter> nvm
[09:44:09] <localh0st> TViernion: I've told you what can you do
[09:44:32] <adv_> anyone?
[09:44:43] <localh0st> codecutter: use .each(function (i, e){})
[09:47:30] <TViernion> right localh0st, that was to include php code... i'm talking about including just the html code .. no scripting
[09:48:46] <localh0st> "to include a php file where it says <p>TheNewTab</p>" I don't understand what does it mean
[09:49:22] <localh0st> ?
[09:49:33] <TViernion> Okay.. can you mis actualy html code, with javascript, with including a file
[09:49:33] <localh0st> include php file?
[09:50:57] <TViernion> something like what i just edited the pastebin to show you where i want to include a file.  It doesn't have to be .php, it can be straight html.
[09:51:56] <localh0st> INCLUDE A FILE HERE
[09:52:02] <localh0st> I don't catch it...
[09:52:43] <localh0st> you can't read files directly from js, you HAVE to use something else to read whatever you want from your filesystem...
[09:53:42] <TViernion> let me back up.  with the appendto function, can i use a file rather than hand code?
[09:58:34] <localh0st> TViernion: no
[09:58:42] <TViernion> ko
[09:59:08] <localh0st> TViernion: but you can read a file with PHP script, and pass it via ajax to your js
[09:59:31] <TViernion> im guessing either php script or html code and return it as we were talking about
[09:59:42] <TViernion> so.. now to go figure that out.
[10:02:10] <TViernion> would i use something like $('').load(
[10:02:51] <TViernion> Nope.
[10:03:05] <Cork> TViernion: .load is if you want to load the content into a dom element
[10:03:12] <Cork> if you just want to grab it use $.ajax
[10:03:22] <TViernion> and i want to append it to an element
[10:03:52] <Cork> something like $.ajax('my-script.php').done(function(response) { $('target').append(response); })
[10:06:04] <TViernion> So, as i'm targeting .tab-content it would be more like : $.ajax('assets/pages/tab_content.php').done(function(response) { $('.tab-content').append(response); })
[10:06:21] <Cork> yup
[10:09:37] <TViernion> okay.. so that worked...
[10:11:47] <localh0st> Cork: ++
[10:13:30] <TViernion> Okay... to get js variables to the ajax call i'd have to truly post though, correct?
[10:14:54] <taplar> you can give variables to any form of ajax request
[10:15:18] <localh0st> TViernion: yes, you can use ajax's setting to post variables: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[10:15:26] <localh0st> settings*
[10:15:48] <TViernion> is it possible to post AND append in the same function or will that be two different functions?
[10:16:16] <taplar> you'll append as part of the success logic of the ajax call
[10:16:50] <taplar> which the success takes a callback, so that will be a function itself
[10:17:34] <localh0st> TViernion: making an ajax call you're passing variables to the script, so you can do everything insingle call
[10:18:04] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/key-concepts/
[10:18:18] <localh0st> TViernion: https://pastebin.com/01DnpU1U
[10:21:06] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/TNmjbNcP  so something like this?
[10:22:17] <TViernion> that will give me the standard variable of $_POST['nextTab'] in php which i can render in the page and then use .done(function(response) { $('.tab-content').append(response); })
[10:22:39] <localh0st> exactly
[10:23:34] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/TNmjbNcP so this should be appropriate?
[10:23:45] <localh0st> TViernion: https://pastebin.com/4SyDJ6Kb
[10:24:00] <localh0st> exactly
[10:24:05] <localh0st> just try..
[10:24:17] <TViernion> i'm editing the .php file now..
[10:25:22] <adv_> taplar, hey!
[10:25:32] <taplar> morning
[10:25:51] <adv_> taplar, so i'm going nuts about yesterday's code with the hammer.js thing
[10:26:01] <taplar> good nuts or bad nuts?
[10:26:05] <adv_> bad
[10:26:09] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/cr9obrt8/embedded/result/ , http://www.augmentedperformance.com/index_mob5.php , identical code produces different results (the case at jsfiddle works as expected, the other doesn't) . i have a single console.log and while on jsfiddle it prints out as the elements appear on the viewport, on the production site it prints them out all at once. so i get 2 print statements on jsfiddle and 114 on the production site. any ideas?
[10:26:55] <adv_> taplar, on production it inits hammer for all elements all at once!
[10:28:59] <taplar> huh
[10:30:39] <taplar> try doing this
[10:30:50] <taplar> change: $(document).ready(function(){
[10:31:01] <taplar> to: $(document).on('load', function(){
[10:31:17] <TViernion> well localh0st i'll be a fucking monkies uncle...
[10:32:42] <adv_> taplar, refresh the page, now it doesn't print at all
[10:34:30] <TViernion> localh0st, appreciate the help... you too taplar
[10:34:52] <taplar> TViernion: np
[10:35:35] <TViernion> just have to figure out why it's being a
[10:35:35] <taplar> adv_: change document to window
[10:35:52] <adv_> $(window).on('load', function(){
[10:35:53] <adv_> ?
[10:35:55] <taplar> ya
[10:36:10] <taplar> trying to get it to wait until all the images are loaded
[10:36:11] <TViernion> annnnd... i forgot to add the closing div.. wonderful... uploading
[10:36:33] <adv_> taplar, refresh, it prints 114
[10:36:38] <taplar> if it inits hammer before the images are drawn, it may be that all your
[10:36:40] <taplar> blah
[10:36:41] <adv_> like document ready
[10:37:17] <adv_> taplar, i'm generating the thumbs with php in a for loop
[10:37:37] <TViernion> the interesting thing is that it's nesting them insdie of themselves
[10:38:05] <taplar> that doesn't make sense, :s.  load should make it wait until the images are loaded, which should definitely push them off the viewport
[10:38:15] <adv_> taplar, so i also tried foreach thumbnail echo thumbnail and then echo '<script> do_hammer() { } </script>
[10:38:16] <adv_> '
[10:38:31] <TViernion> ANNNND i see why... son of a bitch
[10:38:45] <adv_> taplar, same thing, it registers hammer with all of them all at once
[10:39:05] <adv_> the weird thing is that the jsfiddle works :/
[10:39:30] <taplar> yeah
[10:40:27] <adv_> taplar, tried every possible combination, that's why i'm going nuts
[10:41:17] <adv_> was waiting for you to see if i'm forgetting something obvious
[10:43:03] <TViernion> whats interseting is that now that i changed the tab-content to inner-tab-content on the newly created tabs, they are creating and removing correctly but they are not activating properly...
[10:43:36] <taplar> scrubber_mobile is the only place you have hammer logic, right?
[10:43:40] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/SXScfY9f here is what i have, but nothing is throwing an error and I can click on a different tab then back to that one and it shows fine
[10:44:11] <adv_> taplar, yes
[10:45:47] <taplar> that's weird, because it's acting like the elements have been initialized already at the start of the load event
[10:50:37] <adv_> taplar, yeah, the only thing different is the php generating the thumbs so thats why i made sure i execute the function after the dom is ready and after they have been generated
[10:51:45] <adv_> taplar, i also don't understand  $thumbscrubber.get(0),
[10:52:37] <taplar> hammer is expecting a dom element.  $thumbscrubber is a jquery object that contains the dom element.  get(0) breaks the dom element out of the jquery object
[10:52:49] <adv_> i see
[10:54:29] <TViernion> it works without the ajax call, but not with.  Is there something with the way it is appending with the ajax that would make it not visible?
[10:54:47] <TViernion> becuase i can click on say the link for tab six then back on the new tab and it's visible
[10:56:22] <TViernion> http://dev2.42iso.com/mms_angular/dev/test_tab.php demo here .. click add tab and then you see it adds the new tab, makes the tab link visible, but doesn't acutall show the content.  I'm getting no errors either
[11:01:02] <taplar> this plugin is bugged
[11:02:16] <TViernion> are you talking to me taplar/
[11:02:29] <taplar> no, adv
[11:02:42] <TViernion> Ah... becuase i'd have agreed with you if you wer etalking to me lol
[11:32:19] <neo_> hi guys , do you see me ?
[11:32:32] <neo_> I use new client 'heckchat
[11:32:49] <taplar> yup
[11:32:55] <neo_> good
[11:33:39] <neo_> taplar, kkk
[11:33:44] <neo_> how choose name
[11:33:48] <neo_> or need always copy
[11:33:58] <taplar> hmm?
[11:34:03] <neo_> ok, good client , to try add new channels
[11:34:18] <neo_> joine\ #wordpress
[11:34:29] <neo_> join\ #wordpress
[11:34:36] <neo_> can't
[11:34:36] <taplar> : /join #wordpress
[11:34:39] <TViernion> Okay... so this is interesting.  taplar is there some reason why the ajax call and append would cause a problem by any chance?
[11:34:54] <taplar> what kind of problem?
[11:35:09] <neo_> cannot join #wordpress , you are banned
[11:35:10] <neo_> ok
[11:35:28] <TViernion> it's adding the tab, and the tab content.  $('.nav-tabs a[href="#tab_'+nextTab+'"]').tab('show'); is activing the tab link but not showing the actual tab content.
[11:35:49] <taplar> if you inspect the tab, is it there
[11:35:50] <taplar> ?
[11:36:13] <TViernion> yes it is
[11:37:38] <TViernion> I'll tell you whats intersting is that it's almost not return the .append until after the $('.nav-tabs a[href="#tab_'+nextTab+'"]').tab('show'); is executed
[11:38:52] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/SXScfY9f  i added an alert to make sure the variable was still there and if i watch the console its not actually appending until AFTER the alert displays
[11:40:12] <taplar> use a console.log instead of alert
[11:40:28] <taplar> alerts cause the browser to freeze that can affect how things flow normally
[11:41:17] <TViernion> stupid question.. where do i put the console.log at?
[11:41:21] <Anticom> Hi all. Are plugins considered on topic here? I'm having issues with select2
[11:41:29] <taplar> same place as the alert
[11:41:50] <taplar> Anticom: you can ask about plugins.  support may be hit or miss depending upon which one you ask about
[11:42:49] <Anticom> well i'm using select2 with an ajax dataSource and the processResults option to map my response to that IdTextPair. The result of processResults callback is: [{"id":"first.pem","text":"first.pem"},{"id":"second.pem","text":"second.pem"},{"id":"third.pem","text":"third.pem"}]
[11:42:54] <taplar> TViernion: so you have tabs right?  I assume there is a clickable area that switches tabs?
[11:43:05] <TViernion> yes
[11:43:07] <Anticom> However if i open up select2 I'm getting "No results found"
[11:43:19] <TViernion> http://dev2.42iso.com/mms_angular/dev/test_tab.php working demo taplar
[11:43:25] <Anticom> and no errors / warnings / whatsoever in the console
[11:43:38] <taplar> TViernion: i'd be curious if instead of calling that tab('show') what would happen if instead you targeted the clickable area and did trigger('click')
[11:44:33] <Anticom> Any clues what's wrong with it? I thought maybe id has to be a number but i can't find anythings in the docs that explicitly say that, although all the examples always use numbers as id's
[11:44:38] <TViernion> $('.nav-tabs a[href="#tab_'+nextTab+'"]').tab('show');
[11:44:38] <TViernion> 	console.log();	should this work?
[11:45:23] <taplar> uh, you were doing alert(something) before.  i was saying change that instead to console.log(something)
[11:45:50] <TViernion> if i pull the show out.. then click the link it works fine.. so now
[11:46:33] <TViernion> I see what you mean and it logs it fine, still not showing.. i'm looking at the clicking a link now
[11:49:17] <TViernion> okay its something to do with the ajax call
[11:49:51] <taplar> oh
[11:50:00] <taplar> dude, your nav part is outside your done method
[11:50:03] <Anticom> Hm that's even stranger... if i provide that very same array to select2 using the data option it works just fine
[11:50:08] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/A4k8gCxV (if i use this meathod it works fine
[11:50:41] <taplar> $('.nav-tabs a[href="#tab_'+nextTab+'"]').tab('show'); <---- has to be in the done function
[11:50:45] <taplar> not outside it
[11:51:33] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/A4k8gCxV like this?
[11:51:58] <taplar> yes, though for readability maybe multiline that, ;)
[11:52:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/j0mswomz/
[11:53:05] <taplar> so you understand that ajax requests are asynchronous, right?
[11:53:26] <Anticom> Think i've found it. However it's funny that i didn't get that error: https://github.com/select2/select2/blob/04d582123d2df55c2b6b43c74c04d3d43f7dffd5/dist/js/select2.js#L3475
[11:53:30] <TViernion> i do but wasn't thinking about that
[11:53:47] <taplar> k
[11:54:19] <TViernion> I can actually even move the creation of my new tab link into there as well and cut down on things....
[12:20:52] <TViernion> stupid network adapters
[13:25:57] <blight> hi guys
[13:26:39] <blight> i have a stupid question, i hope it's not to mean... for example i want a progress bar with a custom label. there is an example, but why does it take like 20 lines of code and is not just part of the "standard widget"?
[13:26:52] <blight> in jquery-ui
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> what are you using?>
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> (link to the docs would be nice)
[13:29:37] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/#label <-- ln 28 -36 is hardly 20 lines
[13:30:08] <taplar> 8 to be precise, :)
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> i think he's talking about the boilerplate.
[13:30:52] <robertmaxrees> there's a doc ready, 2 var declarations, and a custom function to run after 2 seconds.
[13:30:58] <robertmaxrees> the core plugin is pretty basic though.
[13:31:16] <blight> taplar: line 10-19 is also needed, so 17 then
[13:31:20] <blight> almost 20
[13:31:23] <blight> :-p
[13:31:43] <blight> i guess it's a minimalistic approach
[13:31:50] <blight> which probably makes sense to keep it small
[13:31:50] <taplar> eh, *air quotes* code
[13:32:16] <blight> i am just use to Qt where loads of functions exist :-p
[13:32:18] <blight> *used
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the purpose of Qt and jqui :)
[13:32:52] <robertmaxrees> it's just boilerplate.
[13:41:39] <samsamek> When making an ajax call, in what format should you ‘deliver’ the data?
[13:42:01] <robertmaxrees> most people use JSON
[13:42:21] <samsamek> I see, so this would be valid: $.ajax({data: {'hello' : ‘world’}
[13:42:38] <robertmaxrees> if it's a post, sure.
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> a get would convert that to a querystring.
[13:42:47] <samsamek> exactly
[13:43:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:43:08] <taplar> heh
[13:43:14] <samsamek> its a POST indeed
[13:43:21] <samsamek> cheers
[13:43:22] <taplar> what you pasted was a GET
[13:43:23] <robertmaxrees> kay
[13:44:39] <taplar> {'hello':'world'} in a post doesn't necessarily mean it will be json either.  it could pass a query string in the body too
[13:44:57] <localh0st> robertmaxrees: you can prevent conversion using processData flag
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> oh good point
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> spaced on that.
[13:45:34] <robertmaxrees> "Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing."
[13:45:38] <robertmaxrees> mah bad
[13:45:43] <localh0st> whatever it's by default it's gonna be converted to string
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah that was my mistake
[13:46:24] <robertmaxrees> samsamek i was wrong btwe
[13:46:26] <robertmaxrees> *btw
[13:46:31] <samsamek> oh really?
[13:46:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:46:53] <robertmaxrees> i misspoke.
[13:46:57] <robertmaxrees> ^ read above
[13:48:44] <samsamek> I dont get it, when ‘type’ is set to POST, it shouldnt convert my data to a query string right?
[13:49:10] <taplar> the body can be hello=world as well
[13:49:22] <robertmaxrees> "Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string"
[13:49:26] <taplar> there's nothing inherent with posts that use json
[13:49:39] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ that's where my mistake came from.
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> "By default, data passed in to the data option as an object (technically, anything other than a string) will be processed and transformed into a query string, fitting to the default content-type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". If you want to send a DOMDocument, or other non-processed data, set this option to false."
[13:50:33] <samsamek> i see!
[13:50:41] <samsamek> so how to set the option to false :')
[13:50:54] <samsamek> processData: false
[13:51:18] <robertmaxrees> the same way you set any other option for an ajax call ;)
[13:51:43] <samsamek> so processData : false right? :p
[13:52:06] <robertmaxrees> give it a try.
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> see what happenms
[13:52:11] <robertmaxrees> *happens
[13:52:18] <samsamek> No luck so far :(
[13:52:33] <robertmaxrees> puit your code in a fiddle or somethin' then.
[13:53:04] <samsamek> will do!
[13:56:08] <robertmaxrees> just need the $.ajax call fwiow.
[14:06:11] <samsamek> robertmaxrees: https://kopy.io/FVOcE
[14:07:10] <robertmaxrees> and what is your server getting?
[14:08:21] <samsamek> controller is working just fine, response http 200
[14:08:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:08:37] <robertmaxrees> what is the data your server is getting:?
[14:08:58] <samsamek> you mean whats the request header right?
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> you said "No luck so far :("
[14:09:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to figure out what's broken.
[14:10:06] <samsamek> well im using a php method to catch the ‘hello’ parameter, but its not doing that
[14:10:26] <robertmaxrees> what do you get if you just dump out the entire request?
[14:10:26] <samsamek> its returning null
[14:10:32] <samsamek> this:
[14:11:34] <samsamek> http://www.temporary-url.com/H5Z6VP
[14:19:45] <taplar> ["body":protected]=> string(15) "[object Object]"
[14:20:24] <taplar> so did you leave your ajax call the same, and you only added the processData: false ?
[14:21:18] <taplar> if so I would expect that you would need to JSON.stringify(yourObject) for it to work as expected
[14:27:03] <samsamek> got disconnected
[14:27:22] <taplar> did you see my comments?
[14:27:28] <samsamek> yes! going to try
[14:31:48] <samsamek> JS: https://kopy.io/AWyXi
[14:31:54] <samsamek> server response: https://kopy.io/6ZWEr
[14:32:20] <taplar> yup
[14:32:22] <samsamek> I can see the object in there now, so im probably on the right track
[14:32:45] <taplar> so now you just need to json_decode() it
[14:33:03] <samsamek> thing is, when I post a form to the same controller, I can retrieve using the php frameworks method $this->getRequest()->param(‘fieldname’)
[14:33:32] <taplar> it's not a param though
[14:33:35] <samsamek> so im trying to replicate the same
[14:33:41] <taplar> then you don't want to submit json
[14:33:51] <samsamek> param = a get query string?
[14:33:55] <taplar> yep
[14:33:57] <taplar> but not get
[14:34:06] <taplar> like i said earlier, post can have query string too
[14:34:25] <samsamek> i see, json decode is the way to go I think, going to try!
[14:35:40] <samsamek> taplar: and robertmaxrees thanks a million
[14:35:44] <samsamek> I got it working
[14:35:57] <samsamek> json decode was the last missing link
[15:04:50] <gambl0re> hello?
[15:05:50] <taplar> aloha
[15:12:55] <TViernion> morning!
[15:13:23] <acedia3> g'morning
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> Good afternoon
[15:18:54] <taplar> he says as he gazes longingly at his lovely pimento and cheese...
[15:19:51] <Alex__> hello
[15:20:11] <Alex__> I have a short question about a return statement :D
[15:27:34] <Uhkis> Alex__: asking the question is a lot better than announcing it's existence
[15:29:10] <Alex__> I have this function
[15:29:58] <Alex__> function () {return $('#booksReportForm select[name="tipRaport"]').val() === 'A';}, how can I add an 'or' condition to return statement?
[15:30:31] <Alex__> like function () {return $('#booksReportForm select[name="tipRaport"]').val() === 'A' || value==='B'}
[15:31:03] <Uhkis> just put an if before the return part
[15:33:44] <Alex__> can you show me an example please? the $ sign confuses me
[15:40:04] <taplar> [ 'A', 'B' ].indexOf($('#booksReportForm select[name="tipRaport"]').val() ) > -1
[15:41:43] <Alex__> it worked, thank you so much, you saved my night
[15:59:48] <robertLunch> weeeeeee
[16:00:33] <taplar> were his words as he finished his delectable pimento and cheese, as his hunger had been sated.
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:18:45] <EastFlow> can anyone reccomend a popular jquery on the fly dynamic sidebar?
[16:19:21] <robertmaxrees> "on the fly dynamic sidebar"?
[16:19:37] <EastFlow> meeaning I don't wat to write any html except for the includes
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> "dynamic sidebar" as in...?
[16:22:34] <robertmaxrees> EastFlow just trying to understand what you're looking for heh.
[16:23:26] <robertmaxrees> EastFlow don't PM me :)
[16:23:30] <robertmaxrees> keep it in the channel :)
[16:24:26] <EastFlow> ah.. one example is bigslide.js
[16:24:30] <EastFlow> essentially I already have a page in the html with div classes that contain specific ids.. I want to dynamically generate the sidebar that when items are clicked they jump to those specified ids
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> why not just build that server-side?
[16:26:23] <webley> hi
[16:26:39] <webley> I define a new jquery "plugin" (jquery fn prototype thing)
[16:26:57] <EastFlow> I honestly don't have a valid reason not to build it server side...
[16:26:59] <webley> I use return this.each(...); for supporting more than one element
[16:27:05] <robertmaxrees> EastFlow then do that :)
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> EastFlow building stuff like that with js is often a shoddy proposition.
[16:27:21] <webley> the thing now is that the plugin does something async (and I can't avoid it...) and I need some callback or event or other signalization way
[16:27:29] <webley> robertmaxrees: nodejs?
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> webley i was talking to EastFlow
[16:27:52] <taplar> webley: well, if it does async stuff, usually you'd return a deferred
[16:27:52] <robertmaxrees> webley you can return a promise for the async stuff.
[16:27:59] <taplar> or allow the user to pass in callbacks
[16:27:59] <robertmaxrees> hah, boom
[16:28:15] <EastFlow> robertmaxree fair point
[16:28:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:47] <webley> robertmaxrees: ok, because this.each(...) is used in plugin, I would use a promise, right?
[16:31:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:32:02] <robertmaxrees> what does each have to do with returning a promise?
[16:32:31] <webley> this.each is used so each element passed to jquery plugin is handled individually?
[16:32:35] <webley> is this right?
[16:32:41] <robertmaxrees> right?
[16:32:44] <robertmaxrees> and?
[16:33:14] <webley> ok, so I would collect all these promises in an array and then return promise.all() ?
[16:33:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[16:33:24] <robertmaxrees> each is synchronouse
[16:33:30] <robertmaxrees> *synchronous
[16:33:35] <webley> right, but I have to use a GET request inside
[16:33:39] <webley> jquery ajax/json thing
[16:33:44] <webley> and it is async :/
[16:33:50] <robertmaxrees> do you care about browser support?
[16:33:56] <webley> not really :P
[16:34:06] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'd use jquery's deferreds for this.
[16:34:29] <robertmaxrees> though now i gotta ask why you're firing off multiple ajax requests and not a single one.
[16:34:33] <webley> robertmaxrees: could I use jquery deferreds for this.each(), too?
[16:34:33] <taplar> ^
[16:34:36] <webley> right
[16:34:40] <webley> good point
[16:34:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:34:42] <taplar> $.when will give you a single deferred
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[16:35:00] <webley> hmm, does a jquery have to use this.each - I mean, is it expected to support multiple elements passed?
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't HAVE to, but you should.
[16:35:24] <webley> I see
[16:35:33] <taplar> what exactly does the ajax do?
[16:35:35] <webley> ok, so I use this.each(...) and I use jquery deferred
[16:35:41] <taplar> it may not make sense to return a deferred
[16:35:52] <taplar> it may make more sense to make the user provide callbacks
[16:35:56] <webley> the ajax requests a JSON file that is used to further initialize the plugin and content is added
[16:36:03] <webley> ok, callback is also nice
[16:36:08] <taplar> a single json file?
[16:36:10] <webley> would I have a callback per item (.each)?
[16:36:18] <webley> a single json file per element in this.each(...()
[16:36:25] <taplar> different files though?
[16:36:54] <webley> yes
[16:36:57] <webley> it depends on element
[16:36:59] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:37:08] <robertmaxrees> why doesn't the server just give you a single response?
[16:37:13] <robertmaxrees> seems awfully strange.
[16:37:52] <webley> right, I should clarify this more
[16:39:45] <webley> robertmaxrees: ok, so each element (or only one, well) has a set of html data-* attribures - one attribute is for a json file url
[16:40:10] <webley> the plugin now requests the json file per element and does further setup using the data
[16:40:35] <robertmaxrees> why doesn't the server accept a single call and return a JSON object with all that data?
[16:41:15] <webley> robertmaxrees: good point, each element should be individual, isolated from the others. Including the files
[16:41:20] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:42:21] <webley> so the plugin should initialize a viewer
[16:42:31] <webley> the viewer uses a json file - each element should be able to contain a viewer
[16:42:47] <robertmaxrees> sure.  none of that really explains why they need to be separate requests, but OK :)
[16:42:49] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[16:42:56] <webley> yes :) sorry if I am too complicated
[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> so there are a few ways to approach this.
[16:44:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ev8397m9/ could to something like this.
[16:46:20] <webley> robertmaxrees: thanks! I haven't used jquery so much yet
[16:48:09] <webley> robertmaxrees: nice thing, so this is equivalent to a Promise (bluebird) .all(...), that collected multiple promises and resolves when all promises resolved?
[16:48:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:48:37] <robertmaxrees> why did you add (bluebird) in there?
[16:48:55] <robertmaxrees> and deferreds are compatible with the promises spec
[16:49:09] <webley> robertmaxrees: oh, hehe, I tried to find an equivalent that I know :)
[16:49:11] <robertmaxrees> so that $.when is indeed similar to the native .all()
[16:50:49] <webley> robertmaxrees: thanks :D
[16:50:49] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:50:59] <webley> robertmaxrees: ok, this is much better now, I think I got some lever now to finish this
[16:52:27] <robertmaxrees> webley awesome.  glad to hear :)
[16:53:24] <webley> robertmaxrees: I can also do something (sync this time :) ) in the ajax handler and then return?
[16:53:36] <robertmaxrees> don't ever use sync
[16:53:43] <robertmaxrees> it's a really bad idea.
[16:53:53] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re if you hgave a question just ask.
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> no need to ask to ask.
[16:54:12] <gambl0re> hey robert
[16:54:17] <gambl0re> yea i need some help
[16:54:18] <gambl0re> https://codepen.io/rickyjw/pen/OgdOGP
[16:54:26] <gambl0re> why isn't the last question appearing
[16:54:27] <gambl0re> thanks
[16:55:09] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[16:57:00] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:57:28] <gambl0re> many things
[16:57:34] <gambl0re> can you help me
[16:57:39] <gambl0re> please
[16:57:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to duder./
[16:57:51] <robertmaxrees> gonna walk you through debuggiong it :)
[16:58:13] <gambl0re> ok
[16:58:34] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried to debug it?
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> and the last question DOES appear.
[16:59:40] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to be clearer about your problem.
[16:59:53] <gambl0re> no it doesnt
[17:00:09] <robertmaxrees> the last question is "What is your favourite colour"
[17:00:10] <robertmaxrees> right?
[17:00:22] <gambl0re> where are the options
[17:00:48] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/UcxtlDP.png
[17:00:58] <robertmaxrees> sure looks like those match to me.,
[17:01:16] <robertmaxrees> you realize that arrays are 0 indexed, right?
[17:01:22] <gambl0re> ya
[17:01:36] <robertmaxrees> so the 4th option is there.
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> they all show just fine.
[17:01:50] <gambl0re> i dont see the options
[17:02:16] <robertmaxrees> they're all there.
[17:02:27] <gambl0re> what do you mean?
[17:02:54] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/PjW4WlB.png
[17:02:57] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/oSMHstQ.png
[17:03:01] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/hF2JpU8.png
[17:03:05] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/mNQvafx.png
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> dunno how i can make that any clearer.
[17:03:27] <robertmaxrees> if you press next after that last question, it removes the options and leaves you with just the question and the next button
[17:03:52] <darkSeid_> im seeing exactly the same as robertmaxrees
[17:04:12] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re try this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sgo29edq/
[17:04:17] <robertmaxrees> that do what you're expecting?
[17:05:11] <gambl0re> yea thanks
[17:05:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:05:19] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:05:33] <robertmaxrees> all I did was add 1 to the question number on the display.
[17:05:46] <robertmaxrees> the 4th question was there the entire time, you were just displaying the index of the arrayu.
[17:05:59] <gambl0re> oh ok....cool
[17:06:04] <gambl0re> i have to build some quiz for work
[17:06:23] <robertmaxrees> which is why i asked "you realize that arrays are 0 indexed, right?"
[17:06:58] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out tho.
[17:07:01] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:08:29] <darkSeid_> am i blind? i dont see anything different with what you did robertmaxrees
[17:08:48] <robertmaxrees> ('.question').text(currentQuestion + 1 + '. ' + q[currentQuestion].question);
[17:08:59] <robertmaxrees> i just added 1 to currentQuestion
[17:09:18] <robertmaxrees> he was misreading the question #s and getting tripped up on index 3 being the 4th item in the array
[17:09:26] <darkSeid_> right, gotcha
[17:38:06] <ph88^> if i do   .after("<tr></tr>") i get this printed as literal text in the middle of my table .. how do i make dom elements out of it ?
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle?
[17:41:38] <ph88^> how do i add jquery to jsfiddle ?
[17:41:44] <ph88^> there used to be an option for it
[17:41:50] <robertmaxrees> it's still here.
[17:42:15] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/3x237aG.png
[17:43:59] <ph88^> can't reproduce in fiddle
[17:44:07] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:44:55] <ph88^> https://jsfiddle.net/gbz8pzte/
[17:44:57] <ph88^> oh i can
[17:45:32] <ph88^> oph this fixes it   var parent = $($(this).parent()[0]);
[17:45:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:45:41] <taplar> don't do that
[17:45:46] <taplar> use eq()
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> var parent = $(this).parent();
[17:45:53] <robertmaxrees> .parent() will only get you one element.
[17:45:54] <taplar> or that
[17:47:51] <ph88^> this this actually give back the row i just added ??   image_row = $parent.after('<tr><td colspan="6" style="margin: 0 auto;"><img src="/img/' + job_id + '" /></td></tr>');
[17:48:13] <ph88^> i think not it's removing the wrong row :/
[17:48:21] <ph88^> how can i make a variable to the row i'm adding ?
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[17:48:39] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[17:49:06] <ph88^> if i click a row it should add a row below it
[17:49:19] <robertmaxrees> and not just append it to the table itself?
[17:49:28] <ph88^> if i then click any row it should remove the row which was just added and then add a row below the row i just clicked
[17:49:44] <ph88^> no not append to the end of the table ..
[17:50:41] <robertmaxrees> why not just https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gbz8pzte/1/
[17:51:28] <ph88^> well click hello twice and you will see
[17:51:47] <ph88^> it's removing the hello row but it should remove the row which was just added
[17:52:02] <robertmaxrees> then you gotta track which row is the current "active" one.
[17:52:25] <ph88^> that's what the image_row variable is there for
[17:52:32] <ph88^> i'm just storing the wrong row into it at the moment
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use a var for that tbh.
[17:53:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/gbz8pzte/2/ with the var
[17:54:09] <ph88^> i forgot when to use a var or not a var :/
[17:54:23] <ph88^> i'm very rusty
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> avoid holding a global state in your code.  i'd just stick a class on the element and call it a day./
[17:54:36] <robertmaxrees> but that's just me.
[17:55:24] <taplar> . /3 is without var
[17:56:16] * taplar grows sleepy waiting for functional tests to run
[17:56:55] <Subeleme> $('#test').show("slide", { direction: "left" }, 1000); produces a -> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'height' of undefined
[17:57:03] <Subeleme> 	is this some version mismatch or smth ?
[17:57:12] <robertmaxrees> `gotta fiddle?
[17:58:58] <robertmaxrees> 'cause https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t2kobx11/ doesn't error
[17:59:36] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/gbz8pzte/4/  just moving the row
[18:03:38] <Subeleme> robertmaxrees hmm... trying it in vuejs
[18:03:52] <Subeleme> Subeleme got it working in fiddle aswell
[18:03:57] <Subeleme> robertmaxrees*
[18:04:05] <robertmaxrees> https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html
[18:04:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just use vue's mechanism for that kind of stuff?
[18:06:16] <Subeleme> robertmaxrees jquery would be more easy approach :) 1 line could handle my stuff perfectly
[18:06:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:06:36] <robertmaxrees> if you have vue, go with that heh.
[18:06:51] <robertmaxrees> also: fewer lines != better
[18:09:46] <Subeleme> robertmaxrees I agree. but this situation... every 15y kid open the code and would understand that onclik the div is coming from right to left. otherwise other devs will need to find out what the . is transitions, how they work and so on :)
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:10:48] <robertmaxrees> you want people to learn 2 separate things instead of 1 heh
[18:11:00] <robertmaxrees> like, if you're gonna use vue, then use it.
[18:11:02] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:18:01] <ph88^> is vue.js nice ?
[18:18:16] <robertmaxrees> some people really like it if you need that kind of framework
[18:18:34] <ph88^> what kind is it ?
[18:19:14] <robertmaxrees> meant for the view layer.
[18:19:26] <ph88^> no data store ?
[18:19:42] <Subeleme> robertmaxrees wasn't that hard btw ^^
[18:20:15] <robertmaxrees> Subeleme with vue you mean?
[18:20:21] <Subeleme> robertmaxrees y
[18:20:46] <robertmaxrees> ph88^ https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/state-management.html
[18:22:08] <ph88^> lol in 100ms i can read in a file generate a picture and serve it :P
[18:22:10] <ph88^> very fast
[18:22:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:22:51] <ph88^> i'm using gnuplot on the server to render plots for me
[18:22:57] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:37:05] <catbadger> Hi :D
[18:44:17] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[19:44:34] <Al_nz1> is it ok to force peoples names as camel case in the form itself before sending to db?
[19:52:14] <robertmaxrees> really depends.
[19:52:42] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 would you do just a hard camel case?
[19:53:09] <robertmaxrees> because that logic can come back to bite you.
[19:57:18] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: go on
[19:57:28] <robertmaxrees> So you force camel case, right?
[19:57:39] <robertmaxrees> Meaning the first letter of every name gets a capital and the rest lower?
[19:58:28] <Al_nz1> yes
[19:58:58] <robertmaxrees> OKay.  So what about people whose last names don't follow that kind of format?
[19:59:17] <Al_nz1> like?
[19:59:51] <robertmaxrees> O'Shea
[20:00:11] <robertmaxrees> which is not entirely uncommon.
[20:00:30] <robertmaxrees> basically, never assume name format.  first name, middle name, last name, etc.
[20:00:38] <robertmaxrees> casing, format, whatever.
[20:04:13] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 make sense?
[20:10:44] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[20:17:43] <Al_nz1> so you just store whatever the user types in?
[20:17:47] <Al_nz1> or do you send all to lower
[20:17:50] <Al_nz1> or all to upper
[20:20:08] <robertmaxrees> scan for any injection or anything like that and then let it go in as it wss typed.
[20:33:39] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 also: https://twitter.com/freakboy3742/status/879479907390111744
[22:18:17] <nikio_> was messing about with jquerymobile, is that stuff any good?
