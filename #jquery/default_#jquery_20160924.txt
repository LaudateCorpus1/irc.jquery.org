[04:35:24] <u3d> hi
[04:35:38] <u3d> need help my $.ajax() is not sending post params
[06:26:47] <lilalinux> In a nested UL I want to get all LI that have one or more descendants with a given class AND have one or more descendants without a given class
[06:26:56] <lilalinux> How can I do that with .has()?
[09:51:12] <Jon_R> hmm, here's a weird thing. I create a <div style="position: absolute;"> in jQuery, set its offset with offset(foo), and append it to an element in the document. I then read its position with .offset() and it is not where I just now put it. It is however exactly where I want it.
[09:51:40] <Jon_R> If I later then set its offset again with offset(foo), it goes where I tell it to, which is not where I want it
[10:01:29] <osboxes1> Hi, Jon_r
[10:02:10] <osboxes1> Can you try to explain again what happen with your code? I wanna try to help you :)
[10:03:13] <Jon_R> well i worked out the issue, and found a solution, but it's still slightly odd
[10:04:11] <Jon_R> basically if you set the offset() of an element which is not yet in a document, what it does is set its top and left position absolutely, if you set the offset() of the same element after it is in the document, then it sets its position relative to the document
[10:04:33] <Jon_R> so i changed my code to set the css top and left properties rather than using offset() and now it works :-)
[10:04:57] <Jon_R> i think possibly I was misled by someone else's code that I found on StackOverflow or somewhere, and their code was buggy but neither they nor I realised ;-)
[13:06:21] <FieryCod> Hello my question is how can I apply a certain style only for the specific area of a page. For example: I got a navbar and when I scroll to a specific section I want to change a style of a this 'a' in the navbar which is related to a section in which the scrollbar is
[13:06:34] <FieryCod> What is the best approuch to achieve this
[13:06:36] <FieryCod> ?
[13:10:35] <taplar> some form of a throttled scroll listener on the body that checks to see if you've scrolled to your target distance and if so applies a class to the area which would change the nested styles
[13:12:11] <hellyeah> yo
[13:12:44] <hellyeah> jquery is convenient for Ecma Script 2016 class thing?
[13:12:56] <taplar> hmm?
[13:14:01] <hellyeah> if i am not mistaken you can write oop literally in ecma script 2016 and in 2015 you need prototype for that
[13:14:24] <taplar> you don't need prototype to do oop
[13:14:58] <hellyeah> in 2016 i dont need yes
[13:15:14] <taplar> you don't have to do prototypes in es5 to do oop
[13:15:14] <hellyeah> right?
[13:15:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:15:38] <taplar> closures can work for driving oop logic
[13:15:46] <hellyeah> but you cannot write class {...} in es2015 right
[13:15:52] <taplar> idk
[13:15:56] <hellyeah> closure or clojure?
[13:16:06] <taplar> clojure is a language
[13:16:12] <taplar> iirc
[13:17:17] <taplar> var thing = (function(){ var name= "me"; return { printName: function(){ console.log( name) ; } }; }());
[13:17:22] <taplar> thing.printName();
[13:17:24] <taplar> that's a closure
[13:19:16] <hellyeah> isnt that namespae?
[13:19:35] <taplar> sure
[13:19:52] <taplar> in a sense.  it's scoping down the name variable
[13:20:00] <hellyeah> namespace*
[13:20:00] <hellyeah> this is encapsulation right?
[13:20:21] <taplar> it's a few things
[13:20:37] <hellyeah> well oop has some other principle as well
[13:20:49] <hellyeah> like inherritence, polymorphism
[13:20:49] <hellyeah> you dont do actuaal oop imo
[13:20:52] <hellyeah> you just follow one principle of oop
[13:20:53] <hellyeah> the thing that make program oop is class structure am i wrong?
[13:21:20] <hellyeah> i just try to learn taplar i respect you really
[13:21:33] <taplar> a closure can do all those thing, though for inheritence you'd need the prototype
[13:21:37] <hellyeah> you are like a mentor for me :)
[13:21:57] <hellyeah> well i guess in es2016 you can do inherritence easily
[13:25:04] <hellyeah> is it same to now know anything about prototype?
[13:26:18] <taplar> what do you mean?
[13:27:44] <hellyeah> i dont know anything about prototype
[13:27:54] <hellyeah> :D
[13:28:08] <taplar> putting methods on a prototype is creating methods for the object
[13:28:19] <taplar> so any time you do new Object() it will have those associated methods
[13:28:31] <taplar> they can also reference anything in the object defined with 'this
[13:28:33] <taplar> '
[13:28:40] <hellyeah> this
[13:28:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:28:53] <hellyeah> i just used "this" when i write event
[13:29:01] <hellyeah> i protyped it?
[13:29:04] <taplar> no
[13:29:16] <taplar> well kinda
[13:29:34] <taplar> if your talking about vanilla event handlers your putting them on the element
[13:29:39] <taplar> in which case their context is that element
[13:30:09] <taplar> for jQuery, it doesn't put the event directly on the element, iirc.  however when it invokes it it will call the handler in such a way that the element is the context
[13:30:21] <taplar> so in both cases 'this' for an event handler is the element processing the event
[13:30:41] <taplar> but for prototype methods 'this' is the element that it is operating off of
[13:30:57] <taplar> because you could have 1, 10, 'n' number of those elements, but context matters
[13:31:31] <taplar> Think of it like this.
[13:31:37] <taplar> you've trimmed a string before right?
[13:31:41] <hellyeah> yes
[13:31:50] <taplar> so you did something like .val().trim()
[13:32:02] <taplar> or "somestring".trim()
[13:32:15] <hellyeah> actually i used $.trim(val); but anyway same thing i guess
[13:32:19] <hellyeah> yes
[13:32:30] <taplar> trim() is actually String.prototype.trim
[13:32:40] <taplar> it knows which string it is going to trim because it uses 'this'
[13:32:46] <taplar> essentially
[13:34:23] <hellyeah> oh actually you mean the method you use is prototype method?
[13:34:34] <hellyeah> so yyou are doing "prototype"
[13:34:45] <taplar> trim is a prototype method of the String object
[13:34:55] <hellyeah> in this case trim is just wapper of string.prototype.trim?
[13:35:10] <taplar> idk what $.trim does, i'd have to look at the source
[13:35:31] <hellyeah> taplar:  $.trim() is doing same thing it seems
[13:35:43] <hellyeah> it would be nice you could read jquery source
[13:35:51] <taplar> you can
[13:36:00] <hellyeah> i didnt try it yet
[13:36:01] <taplar> google 'james padolsey, jquery'
[13:36:13] <taplar> he has a nice page where you can view method by method
[13:36:29] <hellyeah> but one of my friend we work together talked about inject some code into jquery source
[13:37:18] <hellyeah> let me check it
[13:37:20] <taplar> if your going to add something you'll either want to follow their plugin logic, or just attach your logic to jQuery.fn or jQuery
[13:37:30] <taplar> i wouldn't go changing the source code file for jQuery
[13:37:43] <hellyeah> it is later issue actually
[13:37:56] <hellyeah> trim is for string manipulation
[13:38:30] <hellyeah> so the thing you means is "if a method changes something on an object, it is alreay prototyped."?
[13:38:57] <taplar> prototype methods have access to an object instantiation's context
[13:39:06] <taplar> by their nature
[13:39:38] <hellyeah> what does instatiation mean?
[13:39:38] <Otter_> hi everyone! having trouble searching for this question because of terms-.-' how can I use $.on() to listen for an event at the document level from my node? the event is coming from a different component that is not a descendant
[13:39:47] <hellyeah> instantiation
[13:39:52] <taplar> new Object() <-- instantiation
[13:40:11] <taplar> Otter_: you have to bind to a shared parent
[13:40:18] <hellyeah> ha
[13:40:19] <taplar> and use a delegated listener
[13:40:25] <hellyeah> isnt it initialization?
[13:40:38] <taplar> hellyeah: no, that's instantiation
[13:40:46] <taplar> which may or may not do some initialization
[13:40:54] <hellyeah> ah
[13:41:19] <hellyeah> thank you tables
[13:41:21] <hellyeah> ops
[13:41:22] <hellyeah> taplar:
[13:41:31] <Otter_> is it not possible to do that then? I just want to replicate this flight functionality if you are familiar `this.on(document, 'event', handler)`
[13:41:49] <taplar> on(event, filterSelector handler)
[13:41:58] <taplar> missed a comma
[13:42:01] <taplar> but you get the idea
[13:42:37] <taplar> $(document.body).on('event', 'childrenSelector', handler);
[13:43:53] <taplar> give learn.jquery.com a gander and search for delegates for more detailed info
[13:44:11] <hellyeah> isnt it delegation?_
[13:44:31] <taplar> what i just gave is, yeah.  but i don't want to explain the whole thing when there is documentation out there, :P
[13:44:42] <hellyeah> speaking of delegation
[13:44:46] <Otter_> if I do add a listener on document with the delegation, can I remove the listener for that delegation only when my component is gone?
[13:44:48] <hellyeah> Otter_:  thats the good link https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:45:02] <hellyeah> you can read this
[13:45:08] <taplar> Otter_: you can remove it whenever, sure.
[13:45:19] <taplar> you can remove with off() if you attached with on()
[13:45:28] <hellyeah> delegation is like
[13:45:37] <hellyeah> subcribing/unsubscribing an event right
[13:45:52] <hellyeah> you use += , -= in c#
[13:45:54] <taplar> no, it's just a different way of binding
[13:45:58] <taplar> huh?
[13:46:03] <Otter_> alright thanks guys! I got it now. just needed a little nudge>.>
[13:46:13] <Otter_> have a good day^.^
[13:47:53] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms366768.aspx
[13:49:15] <taplar> go figure
[13:50:24] <XaroRSA_> general js question
[13:50:40] <XaroRSA_> how can i have a dynamic object method called?
[13:50:43] <XaroRSA_> this is what i have
[13:50:44] <XaroRSA_> v
[13:50:45] <XaroRSA_> steelseries.Linear('canvasLinear1');
[13:50:54] <XaroRSA_> i want the 'linear' to be dynamic
[13:51:01] <XaroRSA_> is this possible?
[13:51:13] <taplar> var methodName = 'linear'; steelseries[methodName]('canvasLinear1');
[13:51:29] <taplar> object methods are properties on the object
[13:51:38] <XaroRSA_> ooo let me try
[13:51:41] <taplar> you can use array notation for them
[13:52:38] <XaroRSA_> bingo
[13:52:42] <XaroRSA_> works like a charm
[13:52:48] <XaroRSA_> thanks a lot taplar1
[13:52:49] <XaroRSA_> !
[13:52:52] <taplar> sure
[13:54:45] <hellyeah> well another thing in oop
[13:54:45] <hellyeah> getter and setter
[13:54:46] <hellyeah> you cannot do that in js/jquery
[13:54:54] <taplar> sure you can
[13:58:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zt19c8bv/
[13:59:04] <hellyeah> really
[13:59:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:59:09] <hellyeah> let me check
[14:00:02] <hellyeah> well i heard trend nowadays is writing modular js code
[14:00:33] <hellyeah> with namespace
[14:00:42] <hellyeah> i though my next step is to leanr how towrite js in oop manner
[14:00:49] <taplar> functional programming is the trend now days
[14:10:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  lambda expression?
[14:11:06] <hellyeah> taplar: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[14:11:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  wow
[14:11:55] <hellyeah> you really defined a class with the help of prototype
[14:12:13] <hellyeah> but you write class with es2016 with class{..}
[14:12:34] <taplar> iirc you can.  it's syntatical sugar for the prototype stuff
[14:14:25] <taplar> you could also do that with closures though, like i was saying
[14:15:34] <hellyeah> well closure seems handier in that case
[14:17:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zt19c8bv/1/
[14:22:18] <hellyeah> taplar_food:  have a good lunch
[14:23:11] <taplar_food> gotta satisfy the munchies
[14:24:30] <taplar_food> in any case, that second example is more along the lines of the functional programming approach iirc
[14:24:35] <hellyeah> seems nice
[18:05:57] <tobh> I'm working on a project where I need to indicate an item is selected, and overlay all other items in the same row. I have the selected item working, but I need it to change if a user selects another item in the same row. I also need an overlay to show on all items except the selected item in the same row. I am stuck at two points. The first being how do I change the selected item indication, and second how d
[18:06:03] <tobh> o I get the overlay to become visible the items not selected? I've tried various routes of achieving this, and have had little success. Here's a link to a JS Fiddle I just put together illustrating a small section of what I'm working on: https://jsfiddle.net/76m671s1/
