[02:08:03] <Darren> https://www.ankitdesigns.com/demo/bysc/smile-moments/ I cannot for the life of me figure out why lightbox isn't loading up centered and why there's a scroll, anyone have any experience with this?
[06:38:06] <itsgokul> how can i set all non selected items indrop down to disabled except one
[06:38:44] <Woet> itsgokul: show us the code you wrote so far
[12:26:23] <devi8> Hey all, I'm trying to implement a "helper" class on a field in a contact form that when clicked appends some text to the input value. The mouseover/mouseout events fire fine, but the click event handler is never called.
[12:26:25] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/JppyVz
[12:26:53] <devi8> if you click on the "email" field the helpers appear. Hovering over them changes their color, but clicking them does nothing.
[12:29:35] <devi8> weird. the mousedown event works, but not 'click'?
[14:42:38] <Valduare> hi guys
[14:43:14] <Valduare> http://stellarchariot.com/blog/2011/02/dynamically-add-form-to-formset-using-javascript-and-django/  trying to figure outâ€¦ the form for this example is wrapped in a div with .item class
[14:43:30] <Valduare> I got it going and then i wanted to put hte form wrapped inside two more divs for styling
[14:43:40] <Valduare> but cant for the life of me figure out how to modify the jqeury to target it then...
[15:06:54] <TruPilot> Hi all :-)
[23:12:19] <alturic> Hey guys, might seem like a silly question, but when developing locally (in PHP I have a constant defined for the SITE_URL), how do you handle the test domain for any sort of calls via ajax, etc?
[23:13:43] <alturic> index.html has a script.js, inside script.js. I guess I could pass the url into the function, but just curious if there's a "better" approach.
[23:24:30] <Woet> alturic: why do you need to add the URL?
[23:25:19] <Rockwood> hi Woet
[23:25:42] <Rockwood> ohh my god you are every where
[23:25:54] <Rockwood> like sky
[23:32:48] <alturic> Woet: What do you mean why do I need to add the URL? Inside a function, there's an ajax request. I need the URL?
[23:33:46] <alturic> In other words, inside of javascript files, I (currently) hard-code the URLs. I'm curious of the proper approach so when you bring that site to a local/development domain, surely people don't mass replace the URL's in their JS files...
[23:35:23] <Woet> alturic: no you don't
[23:35:43] <Woet> alturic: e.g. /postMessage/ works just fine without a domain
[23:36:40] <alturic> If you use api.domain.com or something of the sort? Your local/development domain might be api-local.domain.com.
[23:37:58] <Woet> oh, like that. usually I use a placeholder and replace it during the minifying/combining process
[23:38:02] <alturic> I mean I believe I *could* just make it a global, but... :P
[23:38:32] <alturic> So in my example, you would ultimately mass replace. Granted you wouldn't do it by hand or anything like that, but still.
[23:38:46] <Woet> or you could make it a variable and populate that variable with PHP
[23:38:50] <Woet> much like CSRF tokens
[23:39:43] <alturic> So something like var apiURL = 'api-local.domain.com' in the header, and then call the function apiCall(apiURL, param) etc.
[23:41:16] <Woet> yup
[23:41:50] <Woet> most sites you'll find something like var settings = []; with things like URLs, user ID, language, etc
[23:42:18] <Woet> google uses window.google={}, heh.
