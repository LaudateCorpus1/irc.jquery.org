[09:30:27] <nomius> Hi
[09:33:29] <nomius> I wrote a javascript code for https://kwort.org/news.html where md files are "loaded" from github using marked to show on that "dynamic" page... This is the script I wrote https://kwort.org/js/news.js. The problem is that the promises might not always be resolved in the same order so in some cases one is before the other and so on when I need a strict order... Is it there a quick fix I can implement in my javascript code to sort it out?
[13:43:55] <dx205> Hi, I ran into an issue I wasn't able to solve with google. I have a parsed DOM from $.parseHTML(externalSource) and need to find all 'table' elements with class 'xyz'. If it was the local DOM, I'd do $('table > .xyz'), but with a parsed result all I can think of is $.find, and that doesn't work
[13:55:50] <shoky> dx205 can you show the html
[13:56:28] <shoky> generally that should work, unless the table is a top-level element
[14:04:59] <dx205> turns out I don't know the CSS syntax and I was supposed to do .find('table.xyz'), not table > .xyz
[14:05:08] <dx205> it's not a child element...
[14:05:12] <dx205> thanks anyways!
[20:39:28] <Aljone> hey all , i have that issue $(document).on('click',function(){.... < seems like this functions workong on hover and instead of click, any idea why?
[20:39:47] <Aljone> maybe someone was binding hover on click?
[20:40:50] <Aljone> its basicly looks like this $(document).on('click', selectors.updateCartPC, function(event) {
[20:43:08] <Aljone> i console.log(event) and this is what apears re.EventÂ {type: "click",........
[20:43:11] <Aljone> i really dont get it
[20:43:45] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't fire on hover.  is something triggering clicks on hove?
[20:46:09] <Aljone> i didnt see anything
[20:46:14] <Aljone> i was looking for "hover"
[20:46:37] <Aljone> im trying to figure out what is causing this
[20:48:04] <Aljone> maybe there is other keyword i should search for
[20:48:12] <robertmaxrees> try mouseenter
[20:49:05] <Aljone> not , maybe mouseover?
[20:49:52] <Aljone> not any of those :(
[20:50:58] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[20:51:01] <robertmaxrees> would have to see it.
[20:53:45] <Aljone> want me to paste the entire js file?
[20:54:09] <robertmaxrees> how many lines is it...?
[20:54:34] <Aljone> 10l
[20:54:35] <Aljone> 10k
[20:54:36] <Aljone> lol
[20:54:40] <robertmaxrees> then no...
[20:54:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:54:44] <Aljone> LOL
[20:54:51] <robertmaxrees> is this on a publicly available site or something?
[20:55:29] <Aljone> its shopify website
[20:55:33] <Aljone> i can give u the password
[20:55:40] <Aljone> and u can see it :)
[20:56:30] <robertmaxrees> then nah
[20:56:30] <Aljone> i sent u private msg just look a the menu
[20:56:36] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[20:56:38] <Aljone> ok
[20:56:45] <robertmaxrees> if it's not something that can be shared out to the channel, i don't wanna see it.
[20:57:13] <Aljone> :(
[20:57:16] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[20:57:32] <robertmaxrees> not comfortable with it, plus it circumvents the entire point of the channel :)
[20:58:44] <Aljone> yeah i get it
[20:58:57] <robertmaxrees> does the bug happen when your code isn't there?
[20:59:04] <Aljone> its a theme
[20:59:22] <Aljone> im using a theme i purchased
[20:59:29] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[20:59:49] <robertmaxrees> did you add this click handler code yourself?
[21:00:46] <Aljone> no
[21:01:12] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  so you're trying to figure out how this theme is set up and why certain things are happening?
[21:03:04] <Aljone> yes
[21:03:14] <Aljone> its just this event i cant figure out
[21:03:29] <robertmaxrees> what does the code itself do?
[21:03:40] <robertmaxrees> could be CSS that's involved instead.
[21:04:54] <Aljone> no the code have click event of js
[21:05:03] <Aljone> and i saw console.log inside it
[21:05:12] <Aljone> $(document).on('click', selectors.updateCartPC, function(event) {
[21:05:27] <robertmaxrees> dunno then
