[00:24:46] <bfig> hello, I have a question, how can I force something to be executed as a jquery event, to debug the context? ie, $("someclass").instantlyLaunch(function(){ debugger})
[00:38:50] <AcidRain_ssd> how the hell do i replace the contents of a div?
[00:38:54] <AcidRain_ssd> oh snap
[00:38:57] <AcidRain_ssd> i think i see whats happening
[00:44:26] <kegster> if i wanted to create a javascript (or jquery) based website (more like web application)-- where it sort of acts like a desktop computer rather than a pageload website-- what is the best method to use to start?
[01:06:10] <mozzarella> guys
[01:07:04] <mozzarella> my jquery seems to be messing with the other jquery the webpage is using
[01:07:11] <mozzarella> even though I'm using noConflict
[01:10:11] <mozzarella> how do you explain that
[01:41:49] <qweasdzxc666> ?
[01:42:02] <qweasdzxc666> Guys. I am not getting, if I can run JS code via, e.g. <input> elements at a remote site, is this site XSS vulnerable or no?
[02:37:19] <parveen> adding rules dynamically is not working
[02:37:20] <parveen> $("select[id=event_type_"+id+"]").rules("add", "required",function(element){                                 return $("#type_name_"+id).val()=="";                         });
[02:38:02] <parveen> http://pastebin.com/AyNkRhSN
[02:38:39] <parveen> here id is dynamically generated but i want to validate if another dynamically added field is blank
[02:42:00] <Cork> parveen: don't use [id=] to select ids
[02:42:08] <Cork> cause you are not using ids if you do that
[02:42:23] <Cork> (you're using an attribute selector)
[02:43:12] <parveen> Cork but there is no other way to select the dynamic generated new text box value
[02:43:28] <Cork> sure there is, as long as the id is unique
[02:43:46] <Cork> (though why are you using ids for this, just use a class)
[02:43:58] <parveen> yes , ids are unique for each text box and select box
[02:44:32] <parveen> user need to add value in textbox or select any option from select dropdown
[02:44:49] <parveen> both are dynamic generated
[02:53:45] <Cork> parveen: so just do $('#event_type' + id)
[02:53:53] <Cork> why do it as an attribute selector?
[02:54:03] <Cork> (though note you can't run the selector before the element exist)
[02:56:22] <parveen> Thanks Cork , i did it  , there was issue in my way

[04:43:44] <Douhan> Hello Is there a trick to hide previous 2 elements including current elements. I'll give example
[04:44:24] <Douhan> var a = $('a.test'); a.hide(); a.prev().hide; a.prev().prev().hide();
[04:44:48] <Douhan> Is there a function select previous 2 elements like prevAll but only last 2
[04:56:14] <Cork> Douhan: prevAll or prevUntil
[05:29:45] <syshape> Q: there is a deprecated function I need ($.ui.isOverAxis), but how should I redeclare it ? "$.ui.isOverAxis = function()" or $.widget or $.extend ?
[05:35:04] <toomus> Hi all
[05:37:05] <toomus> I want to load more items from server when user scrolls to bottom, but $(document).height() is different than max $(document).scrollTop()
[05:40:47] <toomus> eg. $(document).height() => 1540, $(document).scrollTop() => 1005 (scrolled to bottom)
[05:42:22] <toomus> Maybe I'm doing it wrong
[06:20:18] <marrenarre> toomus: $(document).scrollTop() + $(window).height()
[06:21:25] <toomus> marrenarre: Yeah, THX :)
[06:22:23] <Duikb00t> Hello
[06:24:53] <toomus> marrenarre: distance to bottom = ($(document).height() - $(window).height()) - $(document).scrollTop()
[06:25:59] <marrenarre> toomus: Do you mean from the bottom of the viewport?
[06:26:34] <toomus> marrenarre: yes
[06:27:38] <marrenarre> Oh yes it is, although I would write it as: $(document).height() - ($(document).scrollTop() + $(window).height())
[06:28:36] <marrenarre> Duikb00t: Hello.
[06:33:59] <Duikb00t> Hi
[06:34:20] <Duikb00t> Not directly JS related but why in the header of the DOM are there links to static.domainname.be ?  view-source:https://www.delijn.be/nl/contact/toegankelijke-rit-reserveren/index.html
[06:34:41] <Duikb00t> Is that just a subdomain they use to store 'static' content which is not changing on their website?
[06:36:25] <marrenarre> Duikb00t: Yes. Probably to avoid that unnecessary things like cookies are sent when fetching things like shylesheets, which (usually, like in this case) don't need it.
[06:36:59] <Duikb00t> So it improves the speed?
[06:37:16] <marrenarre> http://www.yes-www.org/why-use-www/
[06:37:17] <marrenarre> "One common web site optimization is to serve static content from a subdomain, such as static.example.com. If you are using www, then this is no problem; your site’s cookies won’t be sent to the static subdomain (unless you explicitly set them up to do so)."
[06:37:28] <marrenarre> Yes it does.
[06:38:10] <Duikb00t> Oh ok didn't knew that :)
[06:38:17] <Duikb00t> Thanks.
[06:39:09] <marrenarre> NP.
[06:45:12] <Duikb00t> marrenarre you have an idea why using 'em' in css for a site logo is better than pixels for defining the width ?
[06:46:19] <Pazician> What am I doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/yt8utzgt/1/
[06:48:24] <Duikb00t> What sturcture you want it to be Pazician ?
[06:48:30] <marrenarre> Duikb00t: I don't know, but you could read this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/609517/why-em-instead-of-px
[06:48:42] <Pazician> darcyclarke: I want the post-meta be above the h2
[06:49:04] <marrenarre> Also: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm http://www.sitepoint.com/power-em-units-css/ https://css-tricks.com/why-ems/
[06:50:03] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/yt8utzgt/2/  Pazician  ok like that?
[06:50:59] <Pazician> Duikb00t: Now it's just targetting the last article
[06:55:44] <marrenarre> Well I was going to link him this: https://jsfiddle.net/yt8utzgt/3/
[06:59:10] <hellyeah> yo
[06:59:35] <hellyeah> what i wonder is what version of jquery i need to use. I am targetting i.e. 9,10,11?
[06:59:36] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/yt8utzgt/4/  marrenarre  - Paz... but the guy left
[07:00:31] <marrenarre> hellyeah: It seems you can use jQuery 2.x.
[07:00:42] <hellyeah> for i.e. 9
[07:00:51] <marrenarre> IE*
[07:00:53] <hellyeah> i suppose i need to use jquery 1.x?
[07:00:54] <marrenarre> "jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8." https://jquery.com/download/
[07:01:01] <hellyeah> ic
[07:01:14] <hellyeah> if it is 8 i need to use jquery 1.x right
[07:01:20] <arc_> ...
[07:01:34] <marrenarre> Gee I dunno. :P
[07:01:36] <hellyeah> but IE8 i shouldnt use as far as i understand :X
[07:01:46] <arc_> no one should
[07:01:51] <hellyeah> IE 11 seems still buggy
[07:02:04] <arc_> it's a lot better
[07:02:04] <marrenarre> The question is, do your visitors feel the same way?
[07:02:39] <hellyeah> dunno i am using in the bank their browser is IE 8 they think to update it
[07:02:50] <hellyeah> i guess it will be IE 11
[07:02:56] <hellyeah> i will it would be edge
[07:03:03] <hellyeah> people said nice thing about edge
[07:03:40] <marrenarre> Duikb00t: Yeah he did. Same JS as in mine by the way hehe.
[07:04:32] <hellyeah> if i write my code full of jquery do i need es5-shim, es6-shim
[07:06:13] <MACscr> im trying not to touch the original code of a wordpress theme. There is a modal window that is being opened when a button is clicked. Can I override that action with my own jquery function?
[07:06:19] <Cork> hellyeah: jquery doesn't depend on es6
[07:06:31] <Cork> hellyeah: es5 basically all browser supports, so no
[07:06:57] <hellyeah> i heard jquery 3.0.0. on the way
[07:06:58] <Cork> there isn't much reason to use those shims
[07:07:12] <Cork> still doesn't depend on es6
[07:07:20] <hellyeah> ic
[07:07:38] <Cork> es6 isn't backwards compatible
[07:07:55] <Cork> so you would most likely see a jquery-es6-3.0 if that ever happened
[07:08:05] <hellyeah> i guess thats why they suggest es5-shim but in jquery i dont need that
[07:08:12] <Cork> but again, there isn't really a reason to do one
[07:08:24] <Cork> hellyeah: you don't need es5-shim at all
[07:08:39] <hellyeah> Cork: if i use jquery?
[07:08:50] <Cork> you don't need it at all
[07:08:53] <Cork> like i just said
[07:09:04] <hellyeah> okey thank you
[07:09:15] <Cork> you might want to use it if you want to write es6 but have it run as es5
[07:09:15] <hellyeah> but i dont trust i.e.
[07:09:21] <Cork> but... what's the point in that?
[07:09:26] <Cork> you only lose performance
[07:09:26] <hellyeah> i.e. 7 has attackevent instead of addeventlistener
[07:09:51] <hellyeah> if i write something and run it as es5 doesnt seems good idea
[07:09:53] <Cork> jquery already works around that in the 1.x serie
[07:09:55] <marrenarre> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/i.e.#English
[07:09:58] <hellyeah> i have to precompile it
[07:10:02] <Cork> that is what 2.x makes away with
[07:10:18] <Cork> hellyeah: es5 is what all browser supports
[07:10:30] <Cork> es6 is what just landed as a new spec
[07:10:48] <Cork> well not all all
[07:11:01] <Cork> but all browsers built in the last like 12+ years
[07:11:19] <Cork> i think ie5 was es4
[07:11:40] <hellyeah> ic
[07:14:21] <hellyeah> btw if it is useful to some onf you
[07:14:28] <hellyeah> this series of videos look good

[07:18:28] <SuperTyp> hello everybody does jquery v 1.11.1 has the once() function?
[07:19:17] <hellyeah> "use strict" is necessary in jquery?
[07:19:30] <Cork> hellyeah: what are you doing?
[07:19:55] <Cork> seams like you are reading though a list of hype words and checks if they are of interesting
[07:19:56] <hellyeah> okey i will be quiet sorry
[07:20:20] <Cork> basically none of what you've found is "necessary"
[07:20:26] <Cork> but you should read into what they are aobut
[07:20:28] <Cork> *about
[07:20:36] <Cork> cause you might want to use them
[07:20:37] <hellyeah> Cork: thanks
[07:20:56] <Cork> but no, they aren't necessary, cause jquery is a compatibility layer
[07:21:08] <Cork> SuperTyp: yes
[07:21:22] <hellyeah> actually i use "use strict" as far as i understand js didnt give you an error for everything when you donmt use "use strict"
[07:21:27] <Cork> SuperTyp: check api.jquery.com
[07:21:36] <hellyeah> Cork: thanks for information
[07:21:38] <SuperTyp> thx Cork that is what I was looking for
[07:46:42] <laravelnewbie> Hi all
[07:48:13] <laravelnewbie> I have to access the multiple json data,actually before today I have used the 1 record accordingly but now I have changed the scenario, so that it can be multiple
[07:48:30] <laravelnewbie> so I am using for but it is not working
[07:48:36] <laravelnewbie> http://jsfiddle.net/qseea36b/
[07:48:44] <laravelnewbie> can anyone help me please
[07:49:03] <Cork> laravelnewbie: you can't loop a string
[07:49:11] <Cork> also the items declaration isn't valid
[07:49:55] <laravelnewbie> actually I am giving the exapmple in that format data is coming in ajax response
[07:50:14] <Cork> laravelnewbie: http://jsfiddle.net/qseea36b/1/
[07:50:23] <Cork> laravelnewbie: i doubt that quite a bit
[07:50:42] <Cork> what you have there is more likely to be what you get
[07:50:57] <Cork> else you're getting a really broken response from the server
[07:51:16] <Cork> (so broken that it isn't too much you can use it for)
[07:51:52] * hellyeah slideUp() and slidDown() seems good animation method.
[07:52:43] <laravelnewbie> Cork
[07:53:01] <laravelnewbie> I am getting the resonse

[07:53:32] <Cork> laravelnewbie: ya, that that isn't what you put in the fiddle
[07:53:32] <laravelnewbie> but i can be multiple
[07:53:44] <Cork> what i changed it to match it
[07:53:54] <hellyeah> i think you should use paste web site
[07:54:04] <Cork> uh... no
[07:56:07] <hellyeah> do you suggest me to chain the function?
[07:56:14] <hellyeah> is there any advantage of this?
[07:57:50] <laravelnewbie> Cork can you suggest me please
[07:57:51] <laravelnewbie> Cork can you suggest me please?
[07:58:10] <Cork> laravelnewbie: well the fiddle i gave you back works
[07:58:18] <Cork> except if crashes cause the function is missing

[08:01:28] <hellyeah> laravelnewbie: check this video series begin from first one

[08:03:42] <laravelnewbie> thanks for suggestion dear hellyeah
[08:53:42] <hellyeah> yo
[08:53:50] <hellyeah> why it printed underfined here https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/17/
[08:56:08] <robhol> that indentation is horrible
[08:56:45] <hellyeah> my indentation?
[08:56:53] <robhol> yes
[08:56:57] <hellyeah> why?
[08:57:19] <hellyeah> i try to learn if you suggest something i will apply it to my code
[08:57:21] <robhol> because it's confusing
[08:57:43] <robhol> js convention is to break after { and before } etc
[08:59:51] <hellyeah> is it like that https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/21/
[09:02:23] <hellyeah> any comment?
[09:07:40] <taplar> don't put $ in front of jsonString, it's not a jquery object
[09:08:12] <taplar> and what are you trying to do?  i'm pretty sure we covered this yesterday
[09:08:40] <hellyeah> humm well
[09:08:53] <hellyeah> i just try to learn what you did yesterday
[09:09:06] <taplar> so go back and look at those fiddles
[09:09:18] <hellyeah> yes
[09:09:24] <hellyeah> i am looking there also
[09:10:15] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/btLpd4bw/14/ i dont understand this {}
[09:10:27] <hellyeah> is it for anynomous function?
[09:11:36] <taplar> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2FReduce
[09:12:12] <taplar> {} is an empty object in that case
[09:16:10] <hellyeah> what does it mean why we give empty object there
[09:16:59] <taplar> you'll have to read the docs.  most likely it's taking the reduce keys from the first element and putting them in the new empty object
[09:17:26] <hellyeah> ah okey sorry
[09:19:58] <taplar> it's the initialValue
[09:20:12] <taplar> Optional. Value to use as the first argument to the first call of the callback.
[09:20:19] <taplar> ^ from docs
[09:21:48] <hellyeah> i understand
[09:22:16] <hellyeah> can i ask why i couldng get value from function https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/42/
[09:23:18] <taplar> your not executing the function
[09:25:49] <hellyeah> hmm may be i made a mistake but i understand like with this way ii suppose to get return variable to the varable? Am i wrong?
[09:25:57] <hellyeah> i guess i am wrong
[09:26:18] <taplar> var something = function() { return 'me'; };
[09:26:25] <taplar> console.log(something) will log the function
[09:26:33] <taplar> console.log(something()) will log 'me'
[09:26:47] <hellyeah> ic
[09:27:29] <hellyeah> yeah but adding this () cause undefined error https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/45/
[09:29:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/46/
[09:29:26] <taplar> what does that function return?
[09:31:20] <hellyeah> undefined https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/47/ really dont know why :/
[09:31:32] <taplar> what do you think it should return?
[09:31:49] <hellyeah> hmm m collection
[09:31:58] <hellyeah> because i am returning collection
[09:32:05] <taplar> why do you think it should?
[09:32:11] <hellyeah> but it is nested function
[09:32:17] <taplar> and why do you think you are returning the collection?
[09:33:09] <hellyeah> return collection; because of that line
[09:33:29] <taplar> that's inside the reduce function
[09:33:52] <hellyeah> yes i just think wrong
[09:34:09] <hellyeah> i will try smt
[09:35:30] <hellyeah> thats something
[09:35:38] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/49/
[09:35:45] <hellyeah> sometimes i am frasturating
[09:35:58] <hellyeah> but i start thinking after a while hope i am in true track
[09:36:50] <taplar> so why was the alert not working
[09:37:15] <hellyeah> sec
[09:37:30] <hellyeah> i just commented out some lines to see the result
[09:38:18] <hellyeah> undefined again https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/50/ hmm
[09:38:43] <hellyeah> DAMN
[09:38:57] <taplar> where are you retuning from
[09:39:01] <taplar> *returning
[09:42:32] <hellyeah> undefined again https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/54/
[09:42:56] <hellyeah> well i am just returning collection and put into collectionStr
[09:43:12] <hellyeah> so collnectionStr i return , i should console Str here
[09:43:16] <hellyeah> it doesnt work
[09:43:32] <taplar> where are you returning collectionStr?
[09:43:34] <jpastore> hi, I was wondering if someone could help me with the validate plugin. basically, I'm looking for direction on how to remove the error class after they change the input to comply with the rules.
[09:47:32] <NoiseEee> jpastore: re-validate?
[09:48:23] <hellyeah> taplar: well collectionStr is returned from reduce function i just get the collection to collectionStr for using it in the oıutside function
[09:48:38] <taplar> really?  the outside function?
[09:48:53] <hellyeah> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/57/
[09:49:11] <hellyeah> forEach?
[09:49:13] <taplar> please don't do alerts
[09:49:15] <hellyeah> am i wrong
[09:49:23] <taplar> hold on
[09:49:24] <hellyeah> taplar: okey i wont do that again

[09:51:40] <jpastore> NoiseEee: well, I'm validating again. nothing changes. I tried in the "success" section removing the error class, and then I tried adding a valid class, but it's not removing the error class
[09:52:03] <NoiseEee> jpastore: ahh i see. i don't know much about the library. is there documentation somewhere?
[09:53:43] <hellyeah> taplar: but collectionString gave me undefined https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/62/
[09:54:06] <taplar> to return a value from a function, you must return it
[09:54:32] <hellyeah> just a sec
[09:54:44] <jpastore> jpastore: yea but I'm not figuring it out from the docs or google/stack[overlfow|exchange] http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate
[09:55:03] <hellyeah> taplar: gave me uundefined again https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/63/
[09:56:23] <hellyeah> ifd logic is same here same thing must happen
[09:56:34] <hellyeah> i can put Str into collectionString
[09:56:35] <taplar> so what does forEach() return?
[09:57:09] <hellyeah> collectionString
[09:57:17] <taplar> that's what your callback returns
[09:57:22] <taplar> what does forEach() return?
[09:57:28] <taplar> what is the purpose of forEach()
[09:58:07] <hellyeah> purpoose of forEach is to traverse the array
[09:58:37] <hellyeah> traverse index by index and stringify it then
[09:58:54] <taplar> so what part of forEach() says it returns something?
[09:59:08] <hellyeah> actually i am not sure trurning something from forEach make sense?
[09:59:18] <hellyeah> :p
[09:59:24] <taplar> hmm?
[09:59:45] <hellyeah> but
[09:59:53] <hellyeah> actually i consider like
[10:00:07] <hellyeah> Str is an object there
[10:00:16] <taplar> variable
[10:00:23] <hellyeah> sorry
[10:00:28] <hellyeah> str is variable there
[10:00:41] <taplar> afk a sec
[10:00:44] <hellyeah> forEach traverse the array and stringify it then insertt into Str
[10:01:15] <hellyeah> anyway let me finish my sentence i need to smoke for a sec
[10:01:40] <hellyeah> and Str should be fullfilled with index that is reduced then stringified
[10:01:55] <hellyeah> and str should have three index without button_name
[10:01:57] <hellyeah> brb
[10:08:02] <taplar> back
[10:21:34] <hellyeah> taplar: you there?
[10:32:45] <taplar> back
[10:35:20] <hellyeah> i guess i found a way
[10:35:35] <hellyeah> i am not sure this is good way or suggest or preffered way to do that
[10:35:37] <hellyeah> but here https://jsfiddle.net/un76uq7y/74/
[10:37:13] <taplar> take a look at the docs and see how they use it for examples
[10:37:14] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2FforEach
[10:37:40] <hellyeah> lemme look
[10:39:21] <hellyeah> my way is wrong?_
[10:39:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:39:58] <taplar> you usually don't return from a for each
[10:39:59] <hellyeah> that takes three argument
[11:08:19] <exxy-> What criteria determines when a .done() callback is going to be called on a $.ajax (jqXHR) object??  Is it a specific Status Code?
[11:25:35] <mozzarella> I need help
[11:27:29] <jfive> mozzarella: assuming you need help with jquery, you're in the right place!

[11:52:18] <surianup> Hi all
[11:52:40] <surianup> I am appending the html in jquery and wrape a class
[11:53:06] <surianup> but when loop is working it appends the old html too second time
[11:53:07] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/jqusanck/
[11:53:16] <surianup> can anyone please help me
[11:53:40] <robertmaxrees> let me take a look.
[11:54:50] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:55:07] <robertmaxrees> can you make this fiddle functional?
[11:55:24] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, do you know the solution to my problem? :)
[11:55:40] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix your question doesn't involve any jquery usage, so i didn't really look.
[11:55:55] <robertmaxrees> and i don't know what it has to do with a plugin - you're looking for an image to load.
[11:56:06] <surianup> robertmaxrees
[11:56:06] <surianup>  it would not be possible
[11:56:09] <surianup> m sorry
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> surianup yes it would.
[11:56:22] <robertmaxrees> show me what data[2] looks like.
[11:57:09] <phpcoder> hello
[11:57:13] <phpcoder> guys i have a string with html
[11:57:20] <phpcoder> inside this string i have <div>
[11:57:21] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yeah that's the way to check a plugin
[11:57:28] <phpcoder> i should add a pading-left to that div
[11:57:30] <phpcoder> how can i do that?
[11:57:31] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix dunno then mano.
[11:57:35] <phpcoder> i read something about parseHtml
[11:57:42] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder by using css.
[11:57:50] <robertmaxrees> and then give that element a class.
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> surianup http://jsfiddle.net/jqusanck/1/
[11:58:28] <robertmaxrees> i mean, pretty simple stuff.
[11:58:43] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i do not have the dom i have the html
[11:58:46] <phpcoder> on a string
[11:58:59] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder which will get inserted into the document.
[11:59:05] <robertmaxrees> so the CSS will change it.  hence, use css.
[11:59:18] <robertmaxrees> target it through wherever you'll append it.
[11:59:32] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, wait if i do html = $.parseHTML(str)
[11:59:43] <phpcoder> then how cna i select that class of "html" variable
[11:59:45] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder you're convoluting how to do this.
[11:59:58] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:00:02] <phpcoder> yes i have a class the name is .option-value
[12:00:12] <robertmaxrees> then target the class using native CSS>
[12:00:15] <robertmaxrees> no js needed for that part.
[12:00:22] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i do not understand how can i select my option-value class inside the "html" variable
[12:00:37] <taplar> lol
[12:00:44] <robertmaxrees> from CSS?
[12:00:54] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, do you mean $('.option-value') directly ?
[12:01:08] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder you want to style that element with CSS, right?
[12:01:10] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i have the the result of parseHtml inside my HTML variable
[12:01:15] <phpcoder> yes
[12:01:20] <robertmaxrees> then no jquery necessary.
[12:01:20] <phpcoder> the element i have in the string
[12:01:23] <robertmaxrees> just add that class to your CSS>
[12:01:25] <robertmaxrees> and define it.
[12:01:34] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:01:53] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, if i do not use jquery i should select it doing a string substring ?
[12:02:07] <robertmaxrees> don't use jhavascript.
[12:02:07] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[12:02:10] <robertmaxrees> you want css.
[12:02:13] <robertmaxrees> not sure how that isn't clear.
[12:02:23] <phpcoder> i mean.... my string is            str = "<div class="option-value">text text</div>
[12:02:33] <phpcoder> i have to add a style here
[12:02:39] <phpcoder> should i hach the string directly ?
[12:02:56] <phpcoder> i want <div class="option-value" style="padding-left:15px;">text text</div>
[12:02:59] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be in the markup?
[12:03:08] <surianup> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/jqusanck/4/
[12:03:23] <phpcoder> because i am creating aplugin that add styles to a compoenent
[12:03:23] <surianup> I have pasted the code but ajax call not working here
[12:03:33] <phpcoder> something similar to a <select>
[12:03:38] <phpcoder> so i need to style the options
[12:04:04] <robertmaxrees> php then use .find()
[12:04:07] <robertmaxrees> depending
[12:04:09] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:04:09] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:04:19] <surianup> can you please help please
[12:04:20] <surianup> robertmaxrees
[12:04:34] <surianup> http://jsfiddle.net/jqusanck/4/
[12:05:24] <taplar> surianup: what's your issue?
[12:05:29] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, $(html).find('.option-value')
[12:05:29] <phpcoder> ?
[12:05:55] <taplar> phpcoder: that's syntatically correct
[12:06:21] <phpcoder> where my html is      var html = $.parseHTML(str)
[12:06:30] <surianup> taplar when I m wrapimg the class "image_wrapper" it is wraping the old html when looping next time
[12:06:33] <taplar> you can just do $(str)
[12:06:45] <phpcoder> taplar, ooh really?
[12:06:48] <phpcoder> raw html directly ?
[12:06:52] <taplar> yes
[12:06:55] <phpcoder> awesome
[12:07:57] <taplar> surianup: line 28 is selecting all of those elements with that class
[12:08:04] <taplar> if you want the last one added you'll have to rethink that
[12:08:10] <robertmaxrees> back
[12:09:38] <surianup> taplor how can I wrape the html_three variable in image_wrapper class ?
[12:09:43] <AcidRain_ssd> http://pastebin.com/9HcyNb0N can someone plz help me with this?
[12:09:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:09:45] <phpcoder> taplar, thanks
[12:10:03] <surianup> taplor: how can I wrape the html_three variable in image_wrapper class ?
[12:10:07] <AcidRain_ssd> for some reason, "Remove From Favorites" gets changed.  "Add To Favorites" does NOT get changed. .post() is fired in both cases
[12:10:11] <surianup> maine problem is that
[12:10:21] <AcidRain_ssd> all alert()s under .post() will not fire
[12:10:22] <robertmaxrees> surianup http://jsfiddle.net/jqusanck/5/
[12:11:00] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain_ssd btw use ===, not ==
[12:11:03] <phpcoder> taplar, how can i convert it back to string ?
[12:11:11] <robertmaxrees> won't fix your proble, but it's a good habit.
[12:11:17] <AcidRain_ssd> robertmaxrees, thx. ill change this now
[12:11:23] <taplar> phpcoder: you can use prop('outerHTML')
[12:11:28] <AcidRain_ssd> im not sure what the problem is, this was just working not to long ago
[12:11:30] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain_ssd also, that means your ajax calls aren't finishing.
[12:11:34] <AcidRain_ssd> not sure what i changed
[12:11:40] <robertmaxrees> so look at your network tab and go from there.
[12:11:47] <AcidRain_ssd> robertmaxrees, hmmm
[12:11:55] <phpcoder> taplar, perfect! thank you so much!!
[12:15:04] <mozzarella> someone help me, the people in ##javascript are not being helpful
[12:15:21] <robertmaxrees> mozzarella you do this every day - if you have a question, just ask.
[12:15:23] <mozzarella> I made a mistake in my script and it didn't execute as a result
[12:15:25] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[12:15:42] <mozzarella> however there was nothing in the console to tell me that there was a mistake
[12:15:57] <mozzarella> how am I supposed to debug mistakes like these?
[12:16:24] <Uhkis> by showing code and asking a question about it
[12:16:36] <robertmaxrees> mozzarella you're being really vague.
[12:16:45] <mozzarella> why can't firefox tell me there's a syntax error or something like that?
[12:16:48] <robertmaxrees> what was the change you made?
[12:16:54] <mozzarella> I wrote function($) { … }(jquery) instead of (function($) { … })(jquery)
[12:17:47] <mozzarella> NOTHING worked, I tried to console.log stuff but it wouldn't log anything
[12:17:49] <robertmaxrees> that thwos an error for me.
[12:17:53] <robertmaxrees> *throws
[12:17:59] <mozzarella> just because of missing parentheses
[12:18:11] <mozzarella> it doesn't here
[12:18:15] <robertmaxrees> SyntaxError: function statement requires a name
[12:18:21] <robertmaxrees> is that in a try/catch block?
[12:18:28] <mozzarella> no
[12:18:29] <robertmaxrees> lots of reasons the error didn't emit to the console.
[12:18:41] <robertmaxrees> so without greater context, it's hard to help.
[12:18:43] <mozzarella> maybe because it's a greasemonkey script?
[12:18:50] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[12:18:56] <robertmaxrees> probably sandboxing.
[12:19:05] <robertmaxrees> so those errors don't destry the page.
[12:19:24] <mozzarella> so how am I supposed to debug those errors
[12:19:29] <robertmaxrees> use a linter.
[12:19:36] <robertmaxrees> what are you using to write your code?
[12:19:45] <mozzarella> vim
[12:19:53] <robertmaxrees> then install a linting plugin for VIM.
[12:19:58] <robertmaxrees> and learn to use it.
[12:21:22] <surianup> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:21:29] <robertmaxrees> surianup see the difference?
[12:21:32] <surianup> its working thankyou v much
[12:21:43] <robertmaxrees> create the object, append to that object, then append the whole mess later.
[12:21:47] <robertmaxrees> that'll also perform a bit better.
[12:22:06] <surianup> yeah I saw it and have learned new thing
[12:22:10] <surianup> thanks buddy
[12:22:12] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[12:22:17] <surianup> :)
[12:36:24] <simpleuser> Hi there. I'm looking for an efficient way of adding some select options to a select field.
[12:36:30] <simpleuser> I found this : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/740195/adding-options-to-a-select-using-jquery-javascript
[12:36:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:36:50] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[12:37:03] <simpleuser> It's okay, but I don't like the idea of playing too much with the dom (appending one at a time all selects). It slows down the thing.
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> how many things are you appending?
[12:37:14] <simpleuser> My question is dumb: How to append all this at a time?
[12:37:20] <simpleuser> Could be 15
[12:37:22] <robertmaxrees> easy.  one sec.
[12:37:38] <robertmaxrees> oh - 15 is nothing.  and because it won't require anything to redraw, that's actually not something to worry about.
[12:37:51] <simpleuser> I tried (newOption('text', 'value')).html() but jQuery does not like it ^^
[12:38:03] <robertmaxrees> newOption() isn't a thing.
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> and that's not what you want anyway.
[12:38:18] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/performance/detach-elements-before-work-with-them/
[12:38:18] <simpleuser> Well isn't there a way to store all these in a string, to append them easily?
[12:38:19] <robertmaxrees> read this.
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want to do ;)
[12:38:50] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1. 15 elements appending to a select isn't going to incur any actual performance hit, so don't prematurely optimize.
[12:39:00] <simpleuser> Well it is quite slow.
[12:39:13] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.  make a fiddle?
[12:39:24] <simpleuser> Mmm good idea!
[12:41:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/sz9jqjj9/
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> not slow at all.
[12:42:00] <simpleuser> Mmm… so you would prefer "append('<option>' + i + '</option>')" solution rather than new Option as it is said in stackoverflow?
[12:42:15] <robertmaxrees> i don't like using contstructors generally.
[12:42:20] <robertmaxrees> *constructors
[12:42:24] <robertmaxrees> they're often unnecessary.
[12:43:12] <robertmaxrees> are you actually noticing performance problems?
[12:43:35] <simpleuser> And to add a value you would just use append('<option value="'+value+'">'+text+'</option>'); ?
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> depending on how much dom work i'm doing, i'd probably just use a templating engine.
[12:44:15] <django_> { jQuery16403362377565354109: 2 }
[12:44:23] <django_> that gets return
[12:45:22] <robertmaxrees> django_ did you have a question ooor...?
[12:45:35] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: ok thanks
[12:45:35] <taplar_lunch> proud statement
[12:46:00] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser but please, don't prematurely optimize. focus on readable code first.
[12:46:11] <robertmaxrees> optmize the poorly performing bits later.
[12:50:28] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: Well to be honest, it seems to me "new Option('some text', 'some value')" is more readable than <option value="'+value'+">'+text+'</option>…
[12:51:03] <robertmaxrees> i disagree, and i generally avoid constructors when poissible.
[12:51:05] <robertmaxrees> *possible
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> the most readable version is the one where you can just call addNewOption(theText, theValue);
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:52:26] <robertmaxrees> actually addNewOption(destination, theText, theValue);
[12:53:44] <simpleuser> yeah, I guess so.
[12:53:57] <robertmaxrees> so abstract all of that away. boom.  problem solved.
[12:54:05] <robertmaxrees> #programming
[12:58:35] <django_> robertmaxrees: is that a jquery object?
[12:58:43] <django_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/yMVUskwA/
[12:58:46] <django_> i ran that
[12:58:52] <django_> and the return was that jquery thing
[12:59:26] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea the nightmare object is.
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> and you mean return document.title;?
[13:03:15] <django_> https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare#usage
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:03:26] <robertmaxrees> back way way way up.
[13:03:35] <django_> sorry
[13:03:52] <django_> if i return document
[13:03:53] <robertmaxrees> can you abstract this out into not requiring me to learn what looks like two different libraries?
[13:04:15] <django_> "Nightmare is a high-level browser automation library"
[13:04:22] <robertmaxrees> i can read, thanks.
[13:04:26] <django_> :( sorry
[13:04:31] <django_> shouda just linke my bad
[13:04:33] <robertmaxrees> is your question about jquery, or about nightmare?
[13:04:34] <django_> im a lazy scrub
[13:04:43] <django_> when i return document
[13:04:56] <django_> I get "{ jQuery16403362377565354109: 2 }
[13:04:57] <django_> "
[13:05:03] <django_> i want to know if that means anything
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you're seeing.
[13:05:19] <robertmaxrees> but that seems weird
[13:05:32] <robertmaxrees> that's basically a way jquery caches certainthings.
[13:05:43] <django_> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/hEhwT8xq/Screenshot%20from%202015-10-29%2013%3A05%3A26.png
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> dunno mang.
[13:11:03] <sublimetext> $('.homeFeatureProduct > img').on('click', function(){  $('.shopNow').trigger('click');  });
[13:11:53] <robertmaxrees> grats
[13:14:10] <sublimetext> for some reason that jquery isn't working for me, when I click the image nothing happens
[13:14:19] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically adding the image?
[13:16:44] <robertmaxrees> sublimetext or is the image in question there on pageload?
[13:17:21] <sublimetext> its on page load
[13:17:53] <robertmaxrees> does a console log in that handler fire?
[13:18:31] <sublimetext> good question
[13:22:54] <yohsii> should every custom validation rule that is created via addMethod support use as a css class on a form element?
[13:23:24] <yohsii> it looks like you need to use addClassRules() to get support for custom validation method as a css class?
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> feel like you skipped something in your question.
[13:24:53] <yohsii> when a new custom validation rule is created via addMethod() is the only option for adding it to the validation of a form via the rules { someField: "myCustomRule"} ?
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not a native part of jquery - are you using some kind of other library?
[13:25:39] <yohsii> ah yeah my bad I'm working with the jquery validation lib with unobtrusive
[13:25:48] <yohsii> not sure if you guys talk that here
[13:26:12] <robertmaxrees> we can, but it's most helpful when you open with noting what you're asking about ;)
[13:26:25] <yohsii> yeah i hear ya, keep thinking its like core jq
[13:26:28] <yohsii> not a plugin
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> definitely not the case :)
[13:26:42] <yohsii> yep
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> and addMethod simply adds the method.  you also have to configure jquery validate to use that method for particular fields.
[13:27:59] <yohsii> yeah and thats where I cant find any specifics, we dont use rules we use declarative
[13:28:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:28:20] <robertmaxrees> you have to play by jquery validate's system.
[13:28:30] <yohsii> yeah and thats what im trying to understand
[13:28:40] <yohsii> been through countless posts and docs
[13:28:52] <lost123> hi, i have  dialog, which appear at the bottom of page, cant center it, if you add to cart on this page you can see http://tinyurl.com/pzqwtw7
[13:28:56] <lost123> any suggestions?
[13:28:59] <yohsii> i thought i was onto something with addClassRules() but that appears to just be a shortcut to map rules to a css clas
[13:29:19] <robertmaxrees> yohsii so your question is how to associate a rule with another selector?
[13:29:34] <lost123> this is my dialog code, seems to be correct http://pastie.org/10516350
[13:30:07] <devslash> I am writing jQuery code that will be used with a wordpress site. The wordpress site loads jquery but for some reason I cannot use $ as an alias and have to use jQuery(...) instead of $(...). Is there an easy way to define $ as an alias for jQuery
[13:30:24] <yohsii> robertmaxrees out of the box when i specify a new validation rule via addMethod("myMethod") can i declaratively wire this up on the element i want to validate? i dont know if its a data-* or a css class or what
[13:30:35] <robertmaxrees> devslash a few ways.  you can use an IIFE.
[13:31:14] <devslash> whats that
[13:31:45] <robertmaxrees> (function($) { /* your code here */ }(jQuery));
[13:31:46] <devslash> I found something that I think should work: window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;
[13:31:56] <robertmaxrees> devslash don't do that.
[13:32:01] <devslash> why not
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> wordpress runs jquery in noconflict mode to reduce the chance of conflicts with other libraries.
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> either disable it or use the iife i just showed you.
[13:32:35] <devslash> ok
[13:33:14] <robertmaxrees> yohsii i can't really remember - jquery validate is one of those things that i forget how to use all the time.
[13:34:17] <yohsii> yaeh ive been through countless posts and docs and whats confusing is this detail
[13:34:19] <robertmaxrees> i think you do it all via the name attribute?
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> so you define the rule, and then define in the configuration what name maps to which rule?
[13:34:37] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[13:34:57] <yohsii> if you specify it in rules yes its rules: { myFormName: { customMethod: "someParameter } }
[13:35:06] <yohsii> but what i dont get is how can i do that via meta data on my markup
[13:35:24] <yohsii> er myFormName I meant myFormElement
[13:35:25] <lost123_> hi, i have  dialog, which appear at the bottom of page, cant center it, if you add to cart on this page you can see http://tinyurl.com/pzqwtw7
[13:35:26] <robertmaxrees> so you cant.
[13:35:36] <robertmaxrees> lost123 make a fiddle.
[13:35:42] <lost123_> any suggestions? this is my code http://pastie.org/10516350
[13:35:58] <yohsii> so all of the out of box ones that come with jquery Validate do that but you cant do your own custom ones? that just doesnt seem right
[13:36:05] <lost123_> robertmaxrees: its a simple dialog, dont know whats making it go to page bottom
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> yohsii that's not what i said.
[13:36:25] <yohsii> oh i saw your <robertmaxrees> so you cant.
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> you can do custom ones all day.
[13:36:33] <robertmaxrees> but you can't do it via markup.
[13:36:40] <yohsii> teh question isnt about the custom validation RULE its about attaching it
[13:36:46] <yohsii> right and i dont believe thats the case
[13:36:48] <robertmaxrees> right, you can't do that part via markup.
[13:36:53] <yohsii> your sayign theres no data-* or class="blah" via markup?
[13:36:57] <yohsii> for custom validation rules?
[13:37:01] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:37:19] <yohsii> i dunno if i buy that
[13:37:29] <robertmaxrees> every time i've set it up that's been the case.
[13:37:34] <robertmaxrees> i could be wrong though.
[13:37:41] <yohsii> youd think theyd letyou do data-<myCustomValidationRule>-<somethignElse>="blah"
[13:37:45] <yohsii> yeah thats what im running into
[13:37:47] <yohsii> as wel
[13:37:49] <yohsii> just doesnt seem right
[13:37:51] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[13:37:56] <robertmaxrees> it's a really terse library.
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> and shoving things into data attributes is kind of gross imo.
[13:38:25] <yohsii> well thats why the built in ones have support for class="required email"
[13:38:29] <yohsii> so that was my next series of questions
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno.
[13:38:36] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> good luck though.
[13:38:50] <yohsii> yeah just tryign to filter out the noise here :)
[13:38:56] <yohsii> no offense i just dont believe that to be the case
[13:38:58] <robertmaxrees> i think under the hood jquery validate already has hooks for those classes, so you need to define those hooks for custom rules.
[13:39:13] <yohsii> right it uses addClassRules() which lets you give a name to a series of rules
[13:39:34] <yohsii> the problem is if you need a user defined value you cant do that its a hardcoded value for all instances of that class rule
[13:39:42] <yohsii> so it works great for things like "required" and "email"
[13:39:48] <yohsii> but not like "maxLength: 10"
[13:39:57] <yohsii> or compareTo: "someSelectHere"
[13:40:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addClassRules/#example:-add-two-compound-class-rules-for-name-and-zip
[13:40:11] <robertmaxrees> this says you're wrong ;)
[13:40:28] <yohsii> sorry what I mean is if the maxlength was variable
[13:40:31] <yohsii> is what im getting at
[13:40:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean stored somewhere on the element?
[13:40:57] <yohsii> sure like imagine a compareTo
[13:40:59] <yohsii> or equalTo
[13:41:12] <yohsii> where each instances of class="equals" would need some bit of data
[13:41:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:41:32] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[13:41:33] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[13:42:03] <yohsii> so i guess the outcome is any custom validation rule that requires a user specified pieec of data can ONLY be specified in .js using rules: {} object
[13:42:13] <robertmaxrees> as far as i can see, yes.
[13:42:16] <robertmaxrees> but i could be wrong.
[13:42:20] <yohsii> yeah I dont buy it
[13:42:24] <yohsii> or at least id like to see it somewhere
[13:42:26] <yohsii> and thats what i cant find
[13:42:28] <robertmaxrees> then contact the maintainer.
[13:42:49] <robertmaxrees> unless somebody else here knows.
[13:42:54] <yohsii> yeah we'll see
[13:42:56] <yohsii> thanks for the chat
[13:43:17] <robertmaxrees> havbe you tried making an isolated test case to play with?
[13:43:23] <yohsii> ofc
[13:43:28] <yohsii> this aint my first rodeo
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> i might share that part out then ;)
[14:25:27] <yohsii> robertmaxrees http://johnnycode.com/2014/03/27/using-jquery-validate-plugin-html5-data-attribute-rules/
[14:25:36] <yohsii> data-rule-* is the built in convention for jquery validation plugin
[14:25:40] <yohsii> again why its not documented no idea
[14:25:42] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[14:25:57] <yohsii> hours of googlign to dig this up
[14:26:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/
[14:26:09] <robertmaxrees> looks like it IS documented./
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> There are several ways to specify validation rules.
[14:27:23] <yohsii> really i dont see data-rule-* anywhere
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> "Both rules and messages can be specified using data attributes, using data-msg (a generic, not-method specific message), data-msg-[method] and data-rule-[method]."
[14:27:47] <robertmaxrees> ctrl+f for the text "There are several ways to specify validation rules."
[14:27:52] <robertmaxrees> that bulleted list explains it.
[14:28:57] <yohsii> for fuck sakes
[14:31:41] <yohsii> odd they say data attributes are the recommended approach for specifying parameters and then go on to not use them anywhere in the sites examples
[14:31:55] <robertmaxrees> could file a bug.
[14:32:08] <robertmaxrees> and explain that the documentation in confusing in that regard.
[14:32:33] <yohsii> yeah
[14:58:21] <fatmandown> Hey guys, I have kind of an interesting problem
[14:58:46] <fatmandown> I have a hidden input form on a main page, and jquery on a windowed page it generates changes that input's value
[14:58:59] <fatmandown> However I need to detect when that input's value is changed, and .change() isn't working
[15:00:37] <fatmandown> i've tried .trigger()ing it when changing the value but it doesn't seem to work
[15:04:59] <romtim> Hello, I have got a problem with the autocomplete ui. I am doing an interactive zip code based search module, and when I type in numbers, my table is automatically "sorted" with corresponding listings. I wanted to use your autocomplete ui for showing autocomplete results in a dropdown.
[15:05:40] <romtim> Once I click on a item in the dropdown however (which also shows the correct values, since I connected it to an array of the zip code of the listings), the number is applied to the text box correctly.
[15:06:14] <TwstdElf> hey all, any help on using .append() on a dynmically added element? (it's the title/credit I can't get to display?) ( http://jsfiddle.net/gLzbq4g0/ )
[15:06:17] <romtim> However, the browser (or code) doesn't see any changes of the value of the text box, therefore the table doesnt sort itself unless I specifically click the text box after selecting a value from the dropdown
[15:06:46] <romtim> Either after I press enter in the text box after selecting a value from the autocomplete. How do I fix this issue?
[15:07:58] <pokergod> which plugin would you use for resizing of table columns?
[15:09:07] <romtim> pokergod, is that a random question or is it related to my problem?
[15:09:29] <pokergod> random
[15:09:33] <pokergod> i didn't see your question
[15:09:39] <romtim> oh ok
[15:18:32] <dopie> in jQuery how do i check if a string is inside the url of the page?
[15:20:20] <jonez> dopie, iirc you can look at document.location
[15:20:47] <dopie> iirc?
[15:22:28] <dopie> Like i want to use toggle
[15:22:44] <dopie> but when the user clicks on the toggle it redirects to  new page and the toggle gets reset
[15:26:00] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:26:14] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish, dopie?
[15:26:46] <dopie> user clicks on a link ... gets directed to the link, clicked link becomes bold
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> add a class server-side that makes it bold.
[15:27:46] <dopie> but the problem is when the user clicks on the link the page gets changed and the old settings take place
[15:28:01] <robertmaxrees> right, which is why you do that server-side.
[15:28:05] <robertmaxrees> not client-side.
[15:28:17] <robertmaxrees> so you don't use any javascript to do it.
[15:28:23] <dopie> hm...... how would i do that server side?
[15:28:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing this is some kind of navigation?
[15:28:39] <dopie> correct
[15:28:45] <TwstdElf> does .closest() not work on elements that have been .append()'d ?
[15:29:04] <robertmaxrees> TwstdElf hrm?
[15:29:12] <robertmaxrees> closest goes through parenbt elements, not children.
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> dopie so add in a check to see if the current page is under the category or whatever that link represents.
[15:29:53] <dopie> php side?
[15:29:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:30:05] <TwstdElf> that might be it - what's the closest() equivilant for children?
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> no exact equivalent, but .find() is similar.
[15:30:26] <robertmaxrees> except find will match all children that match that selector.
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't stop.
[15:30:41] <dopie> robertmaxrees,  ok would you know how to get the url in php
[15:30:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:30:51] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to search through google for that one.
[15:30:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't do php ;)
[15:33:35] <TwstdElf> robertmaxrees: thanks! I targeted the parent and used .children() to select the sub-element, that was the hint I needed! Thanks!
[15:33:57] <robertmaxrees> err, okay.
[15:35:48] <TwstdElf> haha, it makes sense in context. ;) Thanks for the help.
[15:36:13] <sky> is it possible to capture an event keycode via document.on()?
[15:36:15] <robertmaxrees> no, i know what you're doing, i just personally prefer .closest() and then .find(), but whatever floats yer boat.
[15:36:24] <robertmaxrees> sky for the most part.
[15:36:39] <sky> rather than declaring onkeypress for buncha inputs
[15:36:50] <robertmaxrees> sky are they all in a form?
[15:36:54] <sky> yep
[15:36:57] <robertmaxrees> target the form then.
[15:37:06] <sky> .keypress?
[15:37:21] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:37:23] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[15:37:26] <robertmaxrees> the delegated syntax.
[15:37:49] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, know how i can get table column resizing with persistent saves?
[15:37:49] <sky> how do I get the event? from this?
[15:37:56] <robertmaxrees> the event object.
[15:38:06] <robertmaxrees> pokergod "persistent saves"?
[15:38:31] <pokergod> yeah, when you reload the page, the columns are the same size as you resized
[15:38:36] <TwstdElf> looks like .children() and .find() give me the same result - is there a benefit to one over the other? (performance, or other?)
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> .find() goes through all descendents, not just one level, which means it's less concerned with structure.
[15:39:28] <robertmaxrees> also, it's slightly faster, though that's less of a concern.
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> pokergod you'd need a server-side component for that.
[15:40:05] <robertmaxrees> pokergod you'd need to build out the "saving" part yourself.
[15:40:24] <pokergod> what would you use for the column resizing?
[15:40:28] <pokergod> i can write that part
[15:40:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd search github or google and look for that.
[15:40:41] <TwstdElf> good to know! either really will work for my current purpose, thanks again for the assist.
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> TwstdElf i'd highly suggest .find() so it's less fragile if/when you make any design changes.
[15:42:34] <romtim> Why doesnt my text input field update itself unless you click inside of it specifically?
[15:42:58] <robertmaxrees> romtim literally no way for us to know without seeing your code.
[15:43:09] <romtim> When I select a result from the dropdown of autocomplete ui, it displays in the form, but it doesn't actually apply it
[15:43:13] <romtim> Where do I send you the code?
[15:43:18] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.com
[15:43:22] <robertmaxrees> make a standalone example.
[15:43:58] <romtim> how do i do that without adding a jquery ui library at the same time with jquery?
[15:44:18] <robertmaxrees> ... if the issue involved jquery ui you add it.
[15:44:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oLpwabnk/ like this.
[15:45:14] <romtim> oh, thanks
[15:45:24] <sky> robertmaxrees: how do i access the vent object
[15:45:46] <robertmaxrees> sky i have literally no point of reference of what you're talking about.
[15:46:06] <sky> sorry event object. document.on passes the event object somehow?
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:46:19] <robertmaxrees> see the bit about the handler?
[15:55:33] <sky> ah thanks sometimes its too ez :D
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> in general, "read the docs"
[15:56:04] <robertmaxrees> they have everything you need.
[15:56:10] <romtim> http://jsfiddle.net/oLpwabnk/1/
[15:56:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i suggest.
[15:56:25] <romtim> as you can see, it doesnt type "i see it", when you actually click a value from the javascript ui
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> woops haha mixing people up.
[15:56:52] <romtim> In my huge original code that results in not filtering the table unless i press enter or press inside of the input
[15:56:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the dropdown at all.
[15:57:01] <romtim> type 123
[15:57:04] <romtim> in it
[15:57:23] <sky> $(document).on('keypress', '.my input', function(evt) { //evt is my event}
[15:57:33] <robertmaxrees> romtim because #zipid isn't a parent of the element in question.
[15:58:12] <romtim> so, thats when i also added after #zipid, .ui-autocomplete
[15:58:25] <romtim> so it triggers when you click ui-autocomplete
[15:58:27] <romtim> but it doesnt
[15:58:43] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[15:58:45] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:59:40] <romtim> it doesnt in my code... man ive spent the last 3 hours trying to fix this..
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got.
[15:59:49] <robertmaxrees> because it works here.
[16:00:05] <romtim> where can i send you the code?
[16:00:09] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.
[16:00:14] <robertmaxrees> update it and show me.
[16:00:30] <romtim> it is linked to xml files uploaded to servers etc
[16:00:37] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle that you've already got.
[16:00:50] <robertmaxrees> the event binding is the issue.
[16:00:52] <robertmaxrees> not anything else.
[16:04:07] <relipse3> How do I put a bunch of addresses on a google map via javascript (I don't have latlong coordinates)
[16:04:20] <robertmaxrees> that's a really vague question
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> romtim http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oLpwabnk/4/
[16:05:26] <robertmaxrees> this seems to work fine.
[16:09:12] <romtim> im trying to hook up the xml file to jsfiddle
[16:09:15] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:09:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't need it in this case.
[16:09:28] <robertmaxrees> your question is about the event binding, not the xml.
[16:09:34] <romtim> it doesnt display anything
[16:09:38] <romtim> unless the xml file is loaded
[16:09:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oLpwabnk/4/ this does.
[16:10:11] <romtim> im trying to show you my code in entirety, so you understand the problem better..
[16:10:14] <romtim> thats like 5% of the code
[16:10:16] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:10:28] <robertmaxrees> the problem was "clicking on items in the dropdown don't fire an event handler", right?
[16:10:40] <romtim> yes, and those parts of the code are identical
[16:10:50] <robertmaxrees> great- my last fiddle fixes that.
[16:10:55] <robertmaxrees> did you have another question?
[16:11:32] <romtim> thats the code i have in my code...
[16:11:39] <romtim> and it doesnt work in my code, it works separately tho
[16:11:47] <romtim> so the issue is probably not the event handler or something else
[16:11:55] <romtim> and the question is - what is the problem in that case
[16:11:55] <robertmaxrees> or is the event handler AND something else.
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> so show me the last fiddle.
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> that you had.
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter if it's not functioning.
[16:12:11] <romtim> http://jsfiddle.net/oLpwabnk/5/
[16:12:40] <romtim> the part of the code thats in ur fiddle is closer to the end of that
[16:13:08] <robertmaxrees> so none of this needs to be in the success handler of the ajax call.
[16:13:25] <robertmaxrees> at least the event bindings don't.
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener bound to the parent instead.
[16:25:49] <romtim> Jsfiddle just doesn't work with xml... Delegate is depreceated with "on()" which im using.. and it doesnt work outside of the ajax call for some reason
[16:26:05] <robertmaxrees> you didn't read the docs for .on()
[16:26:19] <robertmaxrees> nor any of the information about how you go from .delegate() to .on() :)
[16:27:26] <claytonzaugg> Let's say I have a div with an image of a living room with a TV, the image's max-width is 400px and has a width of 100%. If I wanted to put another image on top of that living room that is the size of the TV screen, how would I do that and make sure the top TV screen image shrinks and aligns as I readjust the larger Living room image?
[16:27:43] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg by asking in #css :)
[16:28:12] <claytonzaugg> lol I've been waiting robertmaxrees, but  #css is non-responsive at the moment.  Just seeing if anyone here knew by chance.
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[16:28:31] <claytonzaugg> fair enough
[16:29:45] <robertmaxrees> romtim what's the parent element of #zipid?
[16:30:13] <romtim> article
[16:30:27] <romtim> body > article > #zipid
[16:30:39] <romtim> article (#xml_wrapper)
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> so then $('#zipid, .ui-autocomplete').on('input change paste keyup click', function() { becomes $('article').on('input change paste keyup click', '#zipid, .ui-autocomplete', function() {
[16:34:42] <romtim> Thanks for that robert, however that didn't fix the issue. I need to run to a doctor now, ill brb with a working jsfiddle to debug this..
[16:34:56] <dopie> robertmaxrees, how do i with jquery get the url params?

[16:35:31] <robertmaxrees> dopie huh?
[16:35:36] <Newyorkadam> hi, I have a modal that I’m currently opening by pressing a button (no jquery involved)
[16:35:42] <Newyorkadam> now I’m trying to get the modal to open on page load
[16:36:03] <Newyorkadam> I found a couple things online but none seem to be working (e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/a/18646882/2150542)
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> Newyorkadam just us your code.
[16:36:34] <Newyorkadam> robertmaxrees: you mean show?
[16:36:39] <robertmaxrees> err,yeah.
[16:38:33] <jimmy> Hi there. Im working on a little hide show function in Jquery UI. Im try to make one button reveal divs with images one after another.The code im using is '$('#content2').show("blind");' . How can I make one .click (function() do this.
[16:39:11] <robertmaxrees> jimmy need more context.  try making a fiddle.
[16:39:12] <sky> jimmy: chaining
[16:41:02] <robertmaxrees> "one after another" is ephemeral.  do you mean on some kind of timer? or what?
[16:41:12] <jimmy> Ok. Every time I click the button I want one image revealed. Where can I get info on chaining?
[16:41:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle.
[16:41:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:41:23] <sky> oh thats not chaining
[16:41:33] <sky> you want do loop through a list
[16:41:39] <robertmaxrees> no need for a loop.
[16:43:32] <romtim> Ok robert, im out for an hour, here is the jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/oLpwabnk/6/ as you can see when you type the first 3 numbers of the zip code, it bolds out in the table, and when you click the autocomplete dropdown, it puts it in the input form, but they dont bold out anymore, unless you press enter afterwards. Please take a look...
[16:43:38] <robertmaxrees> romtim uh
[16:43:49] <robertmaxrees> you're basically saying "here do this work while i'm gone"
[16:43:56] <robertmaxrees> we can work through it when you get back.
[16:43:58] <robertmaxrees> :)(
[16:43:59] <romtim> No, im late for an appointment to my doctor
[16:44:01] <romtim> ok thanks
[16:44:05] <romtim> see you later then
[16:44:06] <robertmaxrees> then go to the appointment.

[16:50:55] <Newyorkadam> robertmaxrees: awesome, thanks!
[16:51:46] <jimmy> <robertmaxrees> That look's really clear.Thanks and going forward can i make those divs draggable with that code?
[16:52:21] <robertmaxrees> jimmy you initialize them as draggables and have them hidden by default.
[16:54:29] <jimmy> robertmaxrees you saved my bacon. ace!!
[17:20:36] <django_> why would someone put all their code inside: $( function( {}))
[17:21:01] <django_> err
[17:21:04] <django_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/HuJWLZ0J/
[17:21:05] <django_> like that
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a document ready.
[17:22:06] <robertmaxrees> same thing as $(document).ready(function() {});
[17:22:11] <django_> ohh
[17:22:16] <django_> ty
[17:32:36] <django_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/dH8S2knd/
[17:32:48] <django_> im trying to find in the documentation where its stated that this is the correct order
[17:33:04] <django_> url, callback, dataType, data
[17:33:08] <robertmaxrees> "order"?
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> order doesn't matter.
[17:33:25] <django_> so i could put the url, data,datatype,callback?
[17:33:32] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:33:35] <robertmaxrees> the names are what matters.
[17:33:38] <django_> callback,data,datatype,url?
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> literally any order.
[17:33:49] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't matter.
[17:33:50] <robertmaxrees> it's an object.
[17:34:37] <django_> ah
[17:35:21] <robertmaxrees> arrays are where order matters.
[17:35:57] <django_> dataType: 'jsonp',
[17:36:02] <django_> is for the callbac
[17:36:05] <django_> callback*
[17:40:53] <jfive> hello
[17:42:21] <robertmaxrees> yo
[18:21:59] <romtim> Hey Robert, I'm back. Could we work this over now? http://jsfiddle.net/oLpwabnk/6/
[18:22:47] <romtim> So basically, when you type 123 for example, it will bold out the 1 2 3 numbers in the  table
[18:22:59] <romtim> but when you make the selection of 12345 in the autocomplete, it won't bold it out
[18:23:12] <romtim> it will bold it out only after you press enter or click in the text box after the autocomplete
[18:26:39] <robertmaxrees> so what part of the code is concerned with that?
[18:30:14] <robertmaxrees> and your issue is likely that your 'this' value is changing.
[18:32:08] <robertmaxrees> oh, hah, nope.
[18:32:21] <robertmaxrees> but quick question - doesn't jquery ui offer callbacks for this?
[18:32:54] <romtim> callbacks for what exactly?
[18:33:03] <robertmaxrees> selecting something from the autocomplete list.
[18:33:11] <robertmaxrees> you're aware that there are custom events for all of that, right?
[18:33:21] <robertmaxrees> like http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-change
[18:33:46] <romtim> yeah i tried adding change to the value
[18:33:50] <robertmaxrees> not change.
[18:33:53] <robertmaxrees> autocompletechange
[18:34:58] <romtim> oh ok, thanks let me check that out
[18:35:12] <robertmaxrees> or the autocompleteselect.
[18:35:18] <robertmaxrees> you're already using the select event.
[18:37:36] <robertmaxrees> select: function(event, ui) {
[18:37:41] <robertmaxrees> duder - just use this.
[18:38:51] <romtim> $('#zipid, .ui-autocomplete').on('input select autocompleteselect change paste keyup click', function (event, ui) {
[18:38:58] <romtim> doesn't change nothing
[18:39:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:39:13] <robertmaxrees> ^ you're already using the select callback in the init.
[18:39:16] <robertmaxrees> so just use that.
[18:41:57] <romtim> I guess you are talking about this part of the code-    select: function (event, ui) {
[18:41:57] <romtim>        $("#zipid").val(ui.item.value);
[18:41:57] <romtim>     }
[18:42:08] <romtim> I tried to replace select with autocompleteselect
[18:42:10] <robertmaxrees> please no multiline pastes in the channel.
[18:42:33] <robertmaxrees> and copy/pasting all of the code you're trying to get to work into that handler makes everything work.
[18:42:50] <romtim> ok sorry, let me see
[18:46:21] <romtim> wow it finally works, thank you for guiding me through this.
[18:47:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd refactor so you can just use those built-in callbacks instead of the event handlers/.
[18:47:38] <romtim> yeah, im trying to figure that out right now, as its the same code twice
[18:47:56] <robertmaxrees> don't use .on() for this.
[18:48:01] <robertmaxrees> use the callbacks entirely.
[18:48:09] <robertmaxrees> define the function and then use it in those spots.
[18:48:35] <romtim> Even if I want it to function outside of the autocomplete section as well?
[18:48:46] <romtim> I mean if someone selects a value or doesn't select, and just presses enter
[18:49:09] <robertmaxrees> that's all apart of the autocomplete system.
[18:49:12] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs - you'll see.
[18:49:15] <romtim> oh ok
[18:49:50] <romtim> What a pain in the ass :) Now that you've seen my level of javascript/jquery, could you recommend me a resource to study js/jquery from my level?
[18:49:56] <romtim> please
[18:49:57] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[18:50:11] <robertmaxrees> mdn is a good resource.
[18:50:14] <robertmaxrees> and keep writing code.
[18:50:25] <romtim> Ok thank you!
[18:50:35] <robertmaxrees> javascript: the good parts is okay, but very opinionated.
[18:50:39] <robertmaxrees> gives you a great starting point.
[18:50:47] <romtim> Ok, will check it out
[19:12:45] <romtim> http://jsfiddle.net/oLpwabnk/8/ - Is this what you meant under defining the function? its "test" - and for some reason it doesn't work once i try to call it
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[19:37:52] <romtim> found it, thank you
[20:20:25] <jimmy> robertmaxrees you gave me some code to make the div reveal on .click.all my divs are dissapearing.http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tw24rcds/1/ can anyone help?
[20:21:25] <jimmy> need the show button to display as a image on load.
[20:29:42] <jimmy> .all my divs are dissapearing.http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tw24rcds/1/ just need the show button to display on load.
[21:01:30] <LindsayMac> Can anyone tell me why this on blur is so finnicky? http://jsfiddle.net/tsukzLvj/3/
[21:02:15] <LindsayMac> The goal is basically to put a border around the parent when you click inside the contenteditable area and remove it when you are no longer inside. an on click doesnt really work because some people may use tab
[21:05:19] <LindsayMac> think i might have to ditch HTML5 contenteditable and use a JS solution to make a textarea
[21:05:35] <LindsayMac> I dont like how the tabindex seems to put the cursor at the beginning of the text. Thats just dumb
[21:23:28] <bobsaccamano> I get a strange error with the supersized fullscreen slider jquery plugin on certain browsers and devices: the images dont load and show up as black background. I'm new to JS/jquery and looking for pointers on how to debug the problem
[22:43:29] <comradequestions> hey guys, could some one help me out? I have an anonymous function where I calculate a width and store it in a variable. Now on window.load, I want to conditionally call that function if the value of that variable is greater then the window width. How can I use the variable outside the function?
[23:10:23] <B_RAD> said i was banned
[23:10:26] <B_RAD> hm
[23:12:24] <B_RAD> THIS
[23:12:27] <B_RAD> wtf is THISSSSSSSSS
[23:12:27] <B_RAD> lol
[23:12:57] <B_RAD> what does .this refer to when its not in a function, I guess the parent object.. or window
[23:13:17] <B_RAD> if its inside a function it refers to it
[23:42:42] <huck5> I'm trying to have a `.click()` function on an element, and inside that have a $(document).click() function. But I don't want the $(document).click() function to be triggered when I first click the elements .click()
[23:43:03] <huck5> I want to click a menu-item, then wait for a click in the main-page. How can I achieve this?
[23:58:17] <BustyLoli-Chan> is there a way to hide an element that is partially visible
