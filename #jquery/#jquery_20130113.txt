[02:30:56] <mboro> hi! is it possible to make the .data() method build a hash table when grabbing HTML5 data attributes? e.g. data-outer-inner=1 translates into { outerInner=1 } and not { outer: { inner: 1 } }
[04:25:46] <helpneeded> whats the best way to insert mutiple data into an auto complete result, right now I have everything working fine, but autocomplete shows "event" column, what If I wanted "date" next to that in the same input field
[04:56:07] <raj> does jquery need <li>'s to be closed?
[05:15:06] <bytephilia> raj what do you mean by that exactly? <li> is an HTML tag that needs to be closed no matter how it's added.
[05:15:36] <raj> not if it's a single line
[05:23:06] <[jmc]> raj: ?
[05:25:42] <ravenzz> [jmc] you can avoid the closing tag
[05:26:06] <ravenzz> raj try and see?

[08:10:41] <JSM87> Hi guys, I have a CSS drop down menu which has a css hover effect which changes the background colour. I was wondering if I can use jquery to make the hover transition fade in
[08:12:13] <helpneeded> I have this function, the problem is it is not displaying "thedate" in the autocomplete dropdown, it only fills in the date to the input field, after "value" has been selected http://pastebin.com/KAeVqJmx
[08:22:05] <rvsjoen> anyone happen to know if I can use the jQuery validation plugin (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation) to validate fields by class ? i.e. applying a "minlength 4, maxlength 8" criteria to all fields with a certain class applied ?
[08:22:32] <rvsjoen> I can't seem to get the selectors right when defining rules
[08:34:22] <JSM87> Hi. how can i use jquery to add a hover effect that fades in to a css class  that changes the background colour...?
[08:45:30] <jamesTuvok> Hi I'm pulling my hair out on this one. A POST ajax login request is working on firefox , but I am getting pending and failed in chrome in the developer net toolbar. status is returning 0 in chrome. There are no x domain issues. Chrome is working on the local server which is not http, but failing on the production https address. Firefox works in both instances. Any ideas? Thanks so much :)
[08:46:21] <jamesTuvok> i meant to say local server is http
[08:52:25] <helpneeded> http://pastebin.com/9zhchnr1     "date" is only added to the input field, how Do I get "date" to be visible in the dropdown
[08:52:29] <helpneeded> >>>>>>>^
[09:32:04] <jamesTuvok> ok, where is the gun? the problem was in how Chrome vs. Firefox handle the manifest file. Chrome is anal about it vs. Firefox.
[10:03:33] <lettr__> hey.. why might be possible my slider starts increasing the speed everytime i open a dialog
[10:05:07] <xdjuj> lettr__ depending on your slider, but you can do this using the callback of your slider
[10:08:13] <lettr__> xdjuj: do what?
[10:09:27] <lettr__> this is my code so far http://jsfiddle.net/nEVwD/

[10:38:48] <coderhut> Hi experts, how can I access the 4th meta element from following variable? http://pastie.org/5679567
[10:42:13] <shoky> coderhut: that's not even valid js
[10:48:39] <lettr__> why im getting 2 callbacks here http://jsfiddle.net/nEVwD/1/
[10:50:40] <mr_daniel> I click and hold the mouse button to slide the slider. But when I leave the browser window, why is the slider still sliding? How is this achieved? Obviously not with "mousemove" event, which trick is used here? http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[10:52:34] <lettr__> any idea?
[10:53:03] <mr_daniel> I am coding a little slider-div myself and I use event like "mousedown", "mousemove" and "mouseout". But with those "traditional" events I see no chance to achieve a similar "outside-browser-still-sliding" effect like the Sliderin jQuier-ui.
[10:55:12] <shoky> lettr__: what do you mean?
[10:55:23] <lettr__> shoky:  look
[10:55:36] <lettr__> shoky:  http://i46.tinypic.com/5v66ab.png
[10:56:38] <lettr__> shoky:  i dont know whats the second one
[10:57:26] <shoky> lettr__: probably a script loaded from inside the php, no?
[11:04:05] <lettr__> shoky:  u were right but i still need to have this in the php file <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/funciones.js"></script> so how can i avoid calling this
[11:04:51] <shoky> why do you need it there if you want to avoid it..
[11:05:11] <shoky> anyway, don't .load() full html pages
[11:05:28] <shoky> load html fragments, you're setting the innerHTML of the element when you do .load()
[11:06:05] <shoky> and usually that will load scripts too
[11:06:59] <lettr__> its weird
[11:07:14] <lettr__> i dont know why its loading this script
[11:08:19] <shoky> mr_daniel: it seems to stop sliding when the mouse cursor leaves the slider's container...

[12:50:51] <cambazz> hello, i have a nav bar, with <ul><li>a</li>...</ul> - i want to show some of the items, and hide the last n. i was doing this programmatically, then i noticed since the width of the items is not fixed and some entities are like "a" others like "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
[12:51:39] <cambazz> how can i dynamically do this with js, like if the ul height has gone after certain level, hide some of the items?
[12:52:09] <Ziggy_> cambazz: Make a jsfiddle of what you are trying to achieve, and I think someone might then be able to help you.
[12:52:15] <chrisbolton> Anyone use the select2 library with rails? Im trying to get one of their examples to work and running into some difficulty?
[12:52:32] <benjick> Hi guys. I'm looking for a script like the one at http://www.formuswithlove.se/ (lightning, furniture, etc) but I'm not sure what it's called so I can't search for it. Can anyone let me know the term?
[12:52:44] <Ziggy_> cambazz: Put the structure up, the data and so on, and write down what the result is you want.
[12:53:49] <DofLeFou> i have a newbie question https://gist.github.com/4526180
[12:54:23] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: Oof, that doesn't look god
[12:54:24] <Ziggy`> good
[12:54:30] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: Let me do a jsfiddle what you might want.
[12:55:08] <Ziggy`> It's not bad, but it can be done in a better way.
[12:55:44] <DofLeFou> Ziggy … I will really appreciate it
[13:02:30] <DofLeFou> Ziggy … my mess was really bad then
[13:05:36] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: Well
[13:05:42] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: It's just not very readable
[13:05:57] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: When I look at it, it simply doesn't make much sense..
[13:06:18] <DofLeFou> how would you do it differently
[13:08:56] <ilian> I have a strange problem, autocomplete with custom items, each containing an a-tag, I have an extra script canceling the click on the link to prevent to user to follow it, but this somehow break the autocomplete
[13:09:39] <ilian> if I select item it works ok, on the next time it don't and so on i.e. it is not working every second click
[13:09:43] <ilian> any ideas
[13:10:29] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: http://jsfiddle.net/aUYQY/3/
[13:11:06] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: Something in this direction.
[13:13:02] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: It does need some work, it's in wrong order there. let me fix that up.
[13:13:49] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: Let me mock up the desired result.
[13:14:22] <DofLeFou> ok
[13:19:22] <veQue> i know this question is vague but ... but when it's all said and done i'm gonna have to ask anyway
[13:19:39] <veQue> if there's no good answer i'll accept the silence
[13:19:50] <veQue> Why is my app not working in IE?
[13:19:53] <veQue> lol
[13:20:03] <veQue> works fine in FF
[13:20:10] <veQue> yep
[13:20:27] <sunbeam> hi, does anyone know whats wrong with $(this).closest("article").children(".someurl div a").attr("href", link);
[13:21:33] <veQue> yup i'll figure this out.. kinda sucks going thru a midle man.. because it doesnt even need to work in ie.. it's gonna be an app
[13:21:53] <veQue> why they cant download firefox to test it out is beyond me
[13:22:39] <deed02392> is there a simple method to add a GET param to the current location?
[13:22:39] <deed02392> with an anchor
[13:23:14] <deed02392> i've got as far as determining whether i need to use ? or & when it comes to appending and returning the desired location
[13:23:21] <bot-t> deed02392, $.inArray crushes IE6 and Chrome if second argument is `null` or ... - Opened 17 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10076
[13:23:49] <deed02392> but because i bind to the click event of the anchor, i give it an href of '#' and it ends up sneaking that in before my added parameter, thus the browser does not redirect
[13:23:53] <deed02392> bot-t, that is not relevant to me
[13:23:54] <bot-t> deed02392, Changed "that".
[13:24:24] <deed02392> what.
[13:32:06] <Ziggy_> DofLeFou: Although your example of code, is slightly different from what you're trying to achieve.
[13:33:04] <Ziggy_> DofLeFou: But the .text() after .wrap is confusing, as well doing .parent() then insertAfter on $(this).find '.sub' ?
[13:33:05] <DofLeFou> yep
[13:33:20] <Ziggy_> DofLeFou: http://jsfiddle.net/aUYQY/4/
[13:33:23] <Ziggy_> Isn't this better?
[13:34:21] <DofLeFou> yep look much better
[13:34:37] <DofLeFou> I m just reading about jQuery chaining
[13:34:56] <DofLeFou> is there a way to chain all that into one single line
[13:35:20] <Ziggy_> How so?
[13:35:29] <Ziggy_> I think it would just make it confusing.
[13:35:37] <DofLeFou> that way .. I believe … my DOM interaction will be much faster
[13:35:56] <Ziggy_> You're only working with the DOM on one line there.
[13:36:20] <Ziggy_> If you want to work with .sub multiple times, create an instance of it, like so var $sub = $('.sub'), then you don't need to look for it every time.
[13:36:53] <DofLeFou> yep .. that kinda idea
[13:37:09] <DofLeFou> I m trying to avoid touching anything in the DOM as much possible
[13:37:31] <DofLeFou> again … I m a newbie… still consuming some reading on this topic
[13:37:36] <Ziggy_> Yeah
[13:38:08] <Ziggy_> Well first thing, in the gist, you were finding $('.sub') two times, which was unneccesary. And if there's only one .sub in your DOM, why do a find?
[13:38:22] <Ziggy_> If you do however need to find the nearest .sub or something, that makes sense
[13:38:43] <Ziggy`> But I think you'd need to provide your html structure so it makes sense I guess.
[13:38:58] <Ziggy`> Since I only have this snippet. and I don't know the current structure.
[13:39:17] <DofLeFou> I m dealing with a Mega Menu .. I ve only copied a sub part of it
[13:39:28] <Ziggy`> I suggest you do as well just use a unordered list.
[13:39:44] <Ziggy`> Rather than having a div for each anchor.
[13:40:01] <DofLeFou> I m basically building a DNN mega menu … that add content on the fly on li hoer
[13:40:23] <DofLeFou> I have a hack that is working … I m just trying to clean it up
[13:41:08] <DofLeFou> You solution is way cleaner than my initial hack
[13:43:12] <DofLeFou> ziggy: here was the initial hack … that i m was trying to rewrite https://gist.github.com/8c233de8b5fde5b9cfc5
[13:43:35] <DofLeFou> as you can see .. it is a little messy
[13:44:22] <Ziggy`> Yeah that's just not readable.
[13:44:41] <Ziggy`> But why not use ul, and li instead of divs there?
[13:49:43] <DofLeFou> good point
[13:50:19] <gf3> pood goint
[13:53:14] <DofLeFou> Ziggy: I really appreciate the points
[13:53:22] <DofLeFou> thank you again for the help
[13:55:00] <Ziggy`> DofLeFou: No problem :)
[13:57:57] <Grundell_> having a small problem
[13:58:42] <Grundell_> i have i simple script on the page that is showing hidden divs when i click it..
[13:59:12] <Grundell_> the problem seams to be that i use a href="#" and it moves me up to top of page
[13:59:25] <Grundell_> is there a way to work around this?
[14:00:23] <Grundell_> like the page is reloaded ...
[14:01:02] <Grundell_> NVW - got it :)
[14:01:03] <Ziggy`> You need to return false, or take a look into preventDefault(), which is though not supported by all browser.
[14:01:21] <Grundell_> how do i return false ?
[14:02:47] <Grundell_> yea got it :)
[14:04:17] <Ziggy`> Grundell_: http://jsfiddle.net/vemMw/
[14:05:05] <Grundell_> Ziggy` - thx :)

[14:38:46] <shoky> BillCriswell: $.when.apply($, arrayOfDeferreds)
[14:39:58] <BillCriswell> shoky: So $.when.apply( $, $('.run-these-forms')); ?
[14:40:08] <BillCriswell> Wait ignore that haha.
[14:41:27] <shoky> lolwat
[14:43:49] <shoky> marinade: you're loading jquery and jquery.fitvids.js, twice, AFTER loading global.js which depends on jquery and jquery.fitvids ..
[14:44:34] <shoky> marinade: loading jquery 3 times actually ;p

[14:46:04] <marinade> shoky how about now
[14:46:29] <shoky> marinade: you tell me.
[14:46:31] <marinade> i was trying to move them before <?php wp_footer(); ?> and i forgot to delete the extra ones
[14:46:39] <shoky> VIEW SOURCE
[14:47:03] <marinade> shoky i am looking at it but don't know what the error is... :8
[14:47:39] <shoky> marinade:  is global.js  loaded before or after  jquery.fitvids.js ?
[14:48:07] <marinade> before
[14:48:16] <shoky> does it need to be before or after?
[14:48:24] <shoky> (who depends on whom?)
[14:48:51] <marinade> ok that makes it clear
[14:49:55] <marinade> thanks shoky
[14:50:07] <marinade> eh u have any idea what's going on with the typekit related js?
[14:50:28] <shoky> first of all
[14:50:29] <marinade> im getting GET http://use.typekit.net/c/53d467/anivers:n4:i4:n7,acuta:n4:i4:n7:i7.NYh:F:2,…62908d04089cfe86ae132cd2fa8e1aaecf613d58fdca0283da14793457ed8d18d75810c190 403 (Forbidden)

[14:50:42] <shoky> you have this unclosed:  <script src='http://tameernyc.com/test/wp-content/themes/tamair/js/jquery.fitvids.js'>
[14:51:05] <marinade> yea jsut closed it
[14:51:28] <marinade> everyhting was working perfectly and then right now i transferred it over onto wordpress and I am just really new to this
[14:51:36] <BillCriswell> shoky: Thanks dude.
[14:51:47] <shoky> np dood
[14:51:54] <marinade> but the typekit js doesn't seem to sit well
[14:52:06] <shoky> i barely even know what typekit is, sry.
[14:52:15] <marinade> lol it's jsut a webfont service
[14:52:33] <shoky> also, no idea if its related, but i donno if loading 2 different jquery versions is a good idea
[14:52:42] <shoky> or loading jquery more than once, for that matter
[14:52:57] <shoky> but no idea how wp deals with that
[14:53:04] <shoky> if it does at all
[14:53:12] <BillCriswell> shoky: Worried I'm over thinking, but am I using this properly? http://pastie.org/pastes/5680406/text
[14:53:23] <marinade> yea i can't seem to find where it is loading the old version of js in my code
[14:54:49] <marinade> bascially this line is creating all that code <?php wp_head(); ?>
[14:54:57] <marinade> but alas that is a wrodpress questiosn
[14:55:09] <shoky> BillCriswell: be careful with jquery's $.map and friends with regards to argument order for the callback

[14:55:25] <shoky>  callback(elementOfArray, indexInArray)
[14:55:54] <shoky> BillCriswell: i'd do  var requests = $('form').map(...).get();
[14:56:25] <shoky> (and here it's  callback(index, domElement)  :P )
[14:56:36] <shoky> for $.fn.map
[14:56:42] <shoky> nasty stuff
[14:56:43] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah, love how it's reversed.
[14:57:09] <ChrisBolton> Anyone use the select2 library in rails? I'm trying to replicate one of their examples and have trouble?
[14:57:21] <shoky> BillCriswell: but your use of $.when looks fine
[14:57:48] <BillCriswell> Ok awesome.
[14:57:51] <shoky> BillCriswell: and just in case you were wondering, the $ argument to .apply is just for decoration ;p
[14:58:04] <BillCriswell> Well, the code has to look pretty.
[14:58:10] <shoky> ;D
[14:58:37] <BillCriswell> Dammit. I'm an idiot.
[14:58:51] <shoky> o?
[14:59:07] <BillCriswell> I need to do it synchronously.
[14:59:17] <shoky> heh
[15:00:01] <BillCriswell> Wonder if I can get away with it.
[15:01:02] <BillCriswell> I guess I could just use gnarf's ajaxQueue.
[15:01:05] <shoky> the answer to such wonderment is usually 'at first, yeah, later on.. pwnd'
[15:01:26] <shoky> yea that could work

[15:35:37] <monk3y> But I wouldn't think that would show no javascript/break it if the scroll-bar was awol.
[15:35:57] <BillCriswell> eip56: What do you get if you log data?
[15:36:10] <BillCriswell> monk3y: Yeah, it's weird. Not sure. :-/
[15:36:19] <BillCriswell> monk3y: True in all browsers?
[15:36:26] <eip56> nvm I figured it out but thanks BillCriswell I had 'html' instead of 'json' in type
[15:36:27] <monk3y> And the second error; Action.js:112 - var panel_name = sel.get('data-panel'),
[15:36:30] <monk3y> (sel is null)
[15:36:36] <eip56> was having a ah f**k moment
[15:36:44] <BillCriswell> eip56: I hear that.
[15:38:57] <monk3y> BillCriswell: good question.  I fired it up in Firefox 16.0.2 and it worked.
[15:39:10] <BillCriswell> monk3y: How about in incognito window?
[15:39:15] <BillCriswell> Could be a plugin fucking with it.
[15:39:20] <BillCriswell> s/fucking/messing
[15:39:38] <monk3y> Chrome:Incognito worked aswell.
[15:39:44] <monk3y> Yep, it'd be a plugin or cookie or something?
[15:39:56] <BillCriswell> monk3y: I'd assume a plugin.
[15:43:00] <monk3y> Okaaay .. so then I went back to a standard Chrome window, Ctrl+Refreshed .. and it rendered the code.
[15:43:26] * monk3y swiftly reintroduces palm to forehead

[15:56:21] <jrdn> does query send an OPTIONS request to servers before posting to a server on a different domain?
[15:58:48] <BillCriswell> jrdn: beforeSend maybe?
[15:59:39] <BillCriswell> This seems kinda relevant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5507234/how-to-use-basic-auth-and-jquery-and-ajax
[16:25:20] <foo> Is there any way to get more info on what's plugged in via USB? I have a 7-port USB3 hub... and it appears to have stopped working (even after a reboot)
[16:26:21] <foo> whoops, wrong window.
[16:27:27] <StephenS> i luv jquery
[16:27:31] <StephenS> I LUV YOU ALL!
[16:29:19] <foo> I am looking for something like this: http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/scroll/ - but that works horizontally so we can put images of varying width/height in there... but we can't seem to find it and have spent hours trying to find an alternative. We looked into swipe.js, but that swipes at a fixed width. We want it to look more like this (for mobile). Any tips?
[16:39:13] <delinquentme> is a JSON object ( once parsed ) supposed to be undefined class?
[16:39:21] <delinquentme> shouldn't it be a hash or something?
[16:39:40] <cusco> it should be a [object]
[16:40:05] <delinquentme> so when I do a.native
[16:40:11] <cusco> should work
[16:40:15] <delinquentme> I get object .. however when I do a.native.class "undefined"
[16:40:19] <cusco> console.log(a.native);
[16:40:31] <cusco> a.native cannot be called
[16:40:36] <delinquentme> typeof
[16:40:41] <delinquentme> not .class :D
[16:41:08] <cusco> where does .class comes?
[16:41:18] <cusco> if itstates undefined, that is what it is
[16:41:20] <cusco> not defined
[16:41:54] <cusco> in chrome, console.log(a); <- you can browse the object in chrome's console
[16:42:28] <delinquentme> native is a reserved KW in jS? huh?
[16:45:05] <cusco> I just assigned a.native = 'string';
[16:45:07] <cusco> no problem there
[16:45:30] <cusco> care to paste some code?

[16:52:44] <sheilablackrose> without min th ecodes works but some portion refreshes the whole page instead of th esectio alone
[16:52:47] * thisboy gives coldhead a head massage
[16:53:22] <sheilablackrose> lol
[16:54:40] <thisboy> sheilablackrose: hard to tell, maybe you could put up a test case on http://jsfiddle.net ?

[18:20:01] <coldhead> rotate your screen 90 degrees?
[18:21:31] <wroathe> k/window 3
[18:25:40] <wroathe> Is there a way to listen for when an element touches th edge of the viewport?
[18:30:10] <marinade_> hey guys my typekit js is not working im geting an error Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)
[18:30:15] <marinade_> www.tameernyc.com
[18:30:34] <coldhead> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHvFptGVUnA
[18:33:28] <marinade_> coldhead that is chill
[18:34:11] <coldhead> very
[18:37:04] <coldhead> marinade_: i don't know diddly about typekit but apparently you can see that error if you've been rate limited
[18:37:18] <coldhead> https://typekit.com/docs/api/errors
[18:38:25] <coldhead> also domain whitelist drama http://www.webdosh.net/2012/01/forbidden-permission-issue-on-typekit.html
[18:38:27] <marinade_> umm how did that happebn
[18:38:52] <coldhead> maybe you can get more data from their control panel or w/e
[18:39:33] <marinade_> coldhead when i first asked this question i realsied i had to update the domain name in the typekit settings
[18:39:43] <marinade_> but i have done that and it still gives that error :(
[18:40:04] <marinade_> btw do u have any idea why my website loads so slow?
[18:40:58] <marinade_> ohhh i have to publish i
[18:41:04] <marinade_> hopefully this works
[18:41:33] <marinade_> lol those xylophones are still going
[18:41:51] <coldhead> marinade_: you might like to try the Y!Slow plugin for your browser
[18:42:01] <coldhead> it will tell you to concatenate your JS
[18:42:19] <coldhead> but i also wonder if you might have something waiting for the window to load rather than for the DOM to be ready
[18:42:22] <marinade_> coldhead i got a score of 86/100 on google speed anaylszer
[18:43:08] <coldhead> i don't have a modern chrome handy but web inspector has tools that shows you profiling/paints/loads etc that might help
[18:43:18] <coldhead> there are screencasts of how to use it
[18:43:27] <marinade_> oh yea i did use that already
[18:43:39] <marinade_> it tells the seconds each thing takes to load
[18:43:47] <marinade_> but i don't know what to do with that info lol
[18:43:52] <coldhead> yes, and tells you when things happen
[18:44:00] <coldhead> so if the paint doesn't happen for 15 seconds
[18:44:05] <coldhead> you can try to work out why
[18:44:11] <coldhead> profiling isn't my forte either
[18:44:18] <coldhead> i mostly just save images out of PSDs
[18:44:52] <coldhead> very likely it seems slow because of the fancy fonts
[18:45:05] <coldhead> it probably waits for them to load before it starts laying out the screen
[18:45:06] <marinade_> well the typekit is getting canceled
[18:46:07] <marinade_> the website html takes abo9ut 390 ms
[18:46:16] <marinade_> that seems to b e the longest item
[18:46:23] <marinade_> i don't know if that is slow or not
[18:47:03] <coldhead> that's not terrible
[18:47:12] <coldhead> but it seems slow because you don't see it loading
[18:47:16] <marinade_> yay the typekit worked
[18:47:19] <coldhead> there's just.. nothing and then... everything
[18:47:20] <marinade_> and it laoded super fast
[18:47:32] <coldhead> oh happy day
[18:47:42] <marinade_> ok no it didnt load superfast
[18:47:48] <marinade_> i jsut got excited about teh fonts
[18:47:58] <marinade_> the logo image is like 170 kb so i ihgt try getting that down
[18:48:13] <marinade_> LOL yea the nothign and everyhting is bizarre
[18:48:44] <coldhead> that feels like a font thing
[18:48:51] <coldhead> maybe try asking in ##css
[18:48:52] <marinade_> the typekit takes 4.10 seconds
[18:48:54] <coldhead> they love that stuff
[18:49:00] <marinade_> o.0
[18:49:05] <RayHerring> is it possible, to focus an input box but not actually trigger the focus event?
[18:49:06] <marinade_> LOL
[18:49:07] <coldhead> true story
[18:49:48] <coldhead> RayHerring: if you could detect a real trigger vs a synthetic trigger in your event handler, would that help?
[18:50:18] <coldhead> http://newcodeandroll.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/how-to-detect-if-event-is-triggered.html
[18:50:23] <RayHerring> sure, basically on focus of a textarea, i need to show a message on screen, which then returns focus to that textarea, but i don't want it to trigger the message the second time
[18:51:01] <RayHerring> at present i have a variable that i set to 'false' after the message, but then if the focus goes to another input box and back to that one, i have to make sure to set the variable to true
[18:51:19] <coldhead> it's easy to test for originalEvent === undefined
[18:51:38] <RayHerring> reading now
[18:51:49] <RayHerring> hrmm, looks easy enough, will have to try a test right now
[18:52:22] <RayHerring> ooooh, hrmm
[18:52:41] <RayHerring> i override the enter key so that it acts like the tab key, since that's what all our sales staff wanted
[18:52:50] <RayHerring> but that means originalEvent will always be undefined for me
[18:53:20] <coldhead> ruh roh
[18:53:37] <RayHerring> i guess my variable will have to do
[18:53:50] <RayHerring> unless i can set originalEvent programatically
[18:54:08] <coldhead> the sales staff are weird
[18:54:18] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[18:54:54] <RayHerring> they are used to the old point of sale
[19:04:05] <Aqeel> hi all
[19:04:55] <Aqeel> how can i access $.fn.abc = function abc (){} in $.fn.def = function def (){}
[19:05:09] <olinux> this works $(this).find('img').attr('src', 'http://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png');  how can i set images to the data-src? my markup .. <img src="" data-src="myimage.png" >
[19:06:04] <coldhead> var $img = $(this).find('img'); $img.attr('src', $img.data('src'));
[19:07:21] <Aqeel> how can i make a function call within the other function
[19:07:31] <Aqeel> that is within the plugin..
[19:07:56] <Aqeel> i am getting typeerror function not found
[19:12:51] <olinux> coldhead awesome, thought i would need each()
[19:15:40] <Aqeel> sorry, it says is not a function
[19:15:48] <Aqeel> in firebug console
[19:16:25] <coldhead> oh you would need to use each if there are multiple images
[19:32:23] <raj> what can I do with this string? 2013-01-14T03:31:46.081755
[19:32:29] <raj> I wanna just have the time
[19:33:01] <raj> and convert it to the user's timezone
[19:34:36] <sam17me> hello
[19:36:12] <ChrisBolton> Anyone familiar with select, Specifically I'm trying to utilize the infinite scroll with remote data (in select2) example working on my local app. I get a json response but I get a "text is undefined" - var match=text.toUpperCase().indexOf(term.toUpperCase()), select2.js line 255 error.
[19:36:53] <sam17me>  echo what's on line 255
[19:37:53] <skamikaze> ChrisBolton: use a debugger and breakpoints? ;)
[19:37:53] <ChrisBolton> Finding it.
[19:38:17] <sam17me> where can I get a good tutorial on how to use breakpoints
[19:38:54] <ChrisBolton> http://pastie.org/5681254 255 is the middle line.
[19:40:59] <sam17me> It could mean that text is not being passed any values so it comes up as undefined
[19:41:18] <foo> I am looking for something like this: http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/scroll/ - but that works horizontally so we can put images of varying width/height in there... but we can't seem to find it and have spent hours trying to find an alternative. We looked into swipe.js, but that swipes at a fixed width. We want it to look more like this (for mobile). Any tips?
[19:41:21] <sam17me> you might want to alert(text) to see what it has in it
[19:45:32] <ChrisBolton> sam17me: I'm throwing some console.logs to see what's happening.
[19:45:55] <sam17me> what do you get
[19:46:07] <coldhead> don't throw console.logs, place them gently
[19:46:47] <sam17me>  ok so one news on how to use breakpoints in chrome
[19:47:12] <coldhead> i do, i use them all the time
[19:47:26] <coldhead> here, i'll use one right now
[19:47:35] <skamikaze> sam17me: there are million tutorials out there how to debug js
[19:48:51] <coldhead> this is a particularly delightful presentation http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[19:49:11] <ChrisBolton> I got my data. And my error got moved.
[19:49:38] <sam17me> chris is that good news or bad
[19:49:48] <ChrisBolton> I don't actually know.
[19:50:04] <ChrisBolton> My Javascript skills are week at best so it's frustrating at this point.
[19:50:10] <ChrisBolton> week = weak
[19:50:15] <sam17me> ok well I would say that it was good that you were getting your data
[19:50:25] <skamikaze> ChrisBolton: use live editing features inside webkit inspector
[19:50:48] <skamikaze> ChrisBolton: simply edit inside chrome, save with control + s, rerun
[19:51:54] <ChrisBolton> skamikaze: How do I do that?
[19:54:33] <skamikaze> ChrisBolton: http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[19:54:57] <coldhead> why does that link seem so familiar
[19:55:21] <skamikaze> oh sry didn't see your post ;)
[19:55:40] <sam17me> I like paul irish, he sounds like a drunk genius
[19:55:42] <coldhead> no cause for apologies!
[19:55:52] <coldhead> he has a beautiful mind, sam17me
[19:56:09] <coldhead> and a generous spirit
[19:56:12] <sam17me> yes I agreee
[19:56:31] <sam17me> makes you wish you grew up and went to school with him
[19:56:48] <coldhead> i wish i were that young
[19:56:54] <coldhead> i would probably have beaten him up
[19:57:00] <skamikaze> lol
[19:57:00] <coldhead> YOU AINT SO PRETTY NOW
[20:06:31] <sam17me> paul irish has a mean ass lisp
[20:07:59] <coldhead> don't be mean you ass
[20:08:14] <martisj_> Say I wanted to do something with an input field only after three characters have been entered, what is the most performant way of doing this?
[20:08:15] <sam17me> no I like it actually
[20:09:28] <skamikaze> martisj_: searching for an autocomplete?
[20:09:29] <sam17me>  get the length of the input field and while input.length<4 do something or do nothing
[20:09:56] <coldhead> martisj_: $('input').keyup(function () { if ($(this).val() > 2) { ... } });
[20:10:01] <martisj_> sam17me: in the eventlistener?
[20:10:11] <martisj_> coldhead: thanks
[20:10:16] <sam17me> tere you go
[20:10:25] <sam17me> coldhead you are a faster thinker
[20:10:27] <sam17me>  I like it
[20:10:27] <martisj_> yeah that's the way i was thinking but was wondering about perf.
[20:10:57] <coldhead> you shouldn't worry
[20:11:05] <coldhead> one event handler per keypress is no bigdeal
[20:11:11] <coldhead> gmail does like 500
[20:11:15] <coldhead> and they're meaty
[20:11:16] <martisj_> coldhead: aha :)
[20:11:19] <skamikaze> but you should use the string's length ;)
[20:11:21] <martisj_> sweet thanks
[20:11:32] <coldhead> sorry, i forgot the .length
[20:11:35] <coldhead> nice save skamikaze
[20:11:45] <sam17me> lol
[20:11:47] <martisj_> for some reason i keep worrying about front-end js/css performance when we have much bigger issues on the backend
[20:11:48] <martisj_> :S
[20:12:13] <skamikaze> coldhead: proofed I really read ya by now ;)
[20:12:24] <coldhead> try not to do anything idiotic is about as far as you need to worry about performance until someone complains
[20:12:27] <coldhead> make it work, then make it fast
[20:12:51] <coldhead> aw bot-t isn't here to issue the pithy quote that agrees with me :(
[20:41:04] <Aqeel> ok guys, if i have a function abc (e){}, if i do not give any value to e it is undefined but if i give it will be defined and i have one specific value for it say true... so if i want to check against it status for error should i say a==='true' || a === undefined or use &&
[20:42:29] <coldhead> if (e === undefined) { ... } else if (e === true) { ... } else { ... }
[20:43:08] <tw2113> DayOneColdhead
[21:02:04] <sam17me>  coldhead you there still
[21:03:02] <coldhead> sure why not
[21:03:13] <b1lly> *shoots coldhead*
[21:03:20] <b1lly> not anymore
[21:03:42] <coldhead> well i died doing what i loved
[21:03:53] <coldhead> picking at my teeth with a swiss army knife
[21:04:02] <sam17me> ok I have an input box and a select box
[21:04:05] <sam17me>  you with me so far.
[21:04:31] <b1lly> cool story
[21:04:44] <b1lly> coldhead: hah
[21:04:45] <coldhead> yes i think i understand
[21:04:54] <coldhead> it's something about a web page isn't it
[21:05:10] <sam17me> yes
[21:05:13] <sam17me>  is that bad.
[21:05:27] <coldhead> no, it happens hundreds of times a day
[21:05:29] <b1lly> sam17me: why would that be bad?
[21:06:47] <b1lly> forms are made to submit multiple data fields
[21:07:35] <sam17me> o
[21:07:37] <sam17me> lol
[21:08:06] <coldhead> let's press on
[21:09:08] <sam17me>  <select><option value=".0-.3">L</option><option value=".4-.6">M</option><option value=".7-.9">H</option></select>
[21:09:39] <sam17me> then you have an <input type= text>
[21:10:19] <b1lly> sam17me: is there a question somewhere
[21:10:44] <sam17me>  if you type in a value of say 4 in the text box and you select M from the select then you should be either given a dropdown that limits you to entering only .4-.6
[21:11:03] <sam17me> and  there should be validation that makes sure that you are in that range
[21:11:12] <sam17me> that's kind of critical to my project
[21:11:42] <b1lly> you've official confused me
[21:11:50] <coldhead> i'm with you, sam17me
[21:12:06] <b1lly> I understand what your trying to do
[21:12:40] <b1lly> but I'm lacking the reason for the second drop down
[21:12:40] <sam17me> the first thing I wanted to do was run a regex that parsed that .4 to .6 and put it in an array
[21:12:58] <sam17me>  then run a validation against the user input to ensure that it was within range
[21:13:21] <b1lly> you should give "names" to your fields first of all
[21:13:23] <sam17me> but if you gave the user a dropdown then they would have not other option but to select the correct range
[21:13:28] <sam17me>  validation through limitation
[21:13:32] <b1lly> <select name="size">
[21:13:39] <b1lly> <input name="qty">
[21:14:00] <sam17me> yes I know I didn't  name them in this example cause my typing was slow
[21:14:04] <b1lly> whats the purpose of reselecting the range? when they already selected medium
[21:14:15] <sam17me>  and I didn't want you to lose interest before I was done putting it on the screen
[21:14:35] <sam17me> Well it's for judges.
[21:15:02] <sam17me> they enter a score, then the say if the score falls in the low , medium or high range
[21:15:40] <b1lly> sure
[21:15:46] <b1lly> then you want them to select a value within that range?
[21:15:50] <sam17me> they can type it manually
[21:16:00] <sam17me>  or they can use the dropdown
[21:16:10] <coldhead> sam17me: http://jsfiddle.net/LYaED/
[21:16:14] <sam17me>  the drop down is a cool feature to have if you click l m or h
[21:17:34] <b1lly> sam17me: is that what you want?
[21:17:40] <b1lly> or was there a 3rd input/dropdown?
[21:17:44] <sam17me>  checkign it out
[21:27:38] <chrisbolton> Is there a way to console.log an element I click on?
[21:29:23] <Aqeel> console.log(this.click());
[21:29:49] <Aqeel> *$(this).click()
[21:33:34] <chrisbolton> Awesome. Thanks.
[21:38:12] <coldhead> um
[21:38:16] <coldhead> good luck with that then
[21:38:35] <tw2113> why are you so day 1, coldhead ?
[21:38:54] <coldhead> inertia, mostly, i guess
[21:42:57] <sam17me> coldhead, where did you
[21:42:59] <sam17me> go
[21:43:06] <tw2113> crazy
[21:43:45] <sam17me> hey if I crash, how do I get back to this channel and network guys
[21:43:46] <sam17me> ?
[21:43:54] <tw2113> connect to freenode
[21:43:59] <tw2113> join #jquery
[21:44:14] <tw2113> repeat the steps that got you here the first time
[21:44:28] <tw2113> coldhead, i heard on his first day, asked what the meaning of $() was
[21:46:26] <prefix> how would I make it so that .scrolltotop takes note of a fixed position div at the top of a page?
[21:47:03] <b1lly> sam17me:  http://jsfiddle.net/b6fcz/1/
[21:48:02] <b1lly> prefix: meaning?
[21:48:15] <prefix> it might be easier to show you
[21:48:15] <prefix> sec
[21:48:18] <b1lly> k
[21:50:02] <prefix> go to the following site, scroll to the bottom and click the "Older Entries" link. You'll see that .scrollTop() executes, but it does not respect the fixed header. http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[21:50:36] <b1lly> ok
[21:50:39] <b1lly> so what is the desired
[21:51:19] <prefix> I would like the page to scoll to the top of the content when scrollTop() fires
[21:51:29] <prefix> I do not want the top article to be cut off
[21:51:34] <Aqeel> prefix whatare you looking for
[21:51:48] <coldhead> i still don't know what $() means
[21:51:53] <coldhead> after this whole first day
[21:51:58] <WeThePeople> hi anybody know how to fix the lightbox2>>> http://imgh.us/Screenshot_from_2013-01-13_23:49:54.png
[21:52:17] <Aqeel> if you want to scroll to top use scrollTop(0)
[21:52:25] <prefix> b1lly / Aqeel I believe that scrollTop needs some sort of offset
[21:52:26] <raj> does .animate() make elements lose their js-based css properties?
[21:52:36] <raj> obviously the element you're running animate on will
[21:52:43] <b1lly> prefix: you dont want to set an offset
[21:52:46] <raj> but what about it's innerHTML?
[21:52:55] <Aqeel> if you want smooth scroll use snimate to scrollTop(0)
[21:52:56] <b1lly> $.
[21:53:01] <Aqeel> animate*
[21:53:10] <b1lly> $('selector') is a jquery object
[21:53:20] <raj> yes
[21:53:43] <raj> one of it's children had a `'right':120` set for it's css
[21:53:45] <b1lly> raj: try it?
[21:53:46] <raj> but after animate
[21:53:48] <raj> it loses that
[21:54:05] <Aqeel> just add the fixed top height you have then
[21:54:11] <b1lly> raj: is your animate effecting those same properties?
[21:54:18] <prefix> b1 / Aqeel this is the current code:
[21:54:19] <prefix> http://pastebin.com/E36sH241
[21:54:23] <raj> only on the parent, technically
[21:54:24] <Aqeel> scrollTop(value of your fixed height)
[21:54:32] <prefix> can you explain what is happening here?
[21:54:39] <raj> why should the children of the element be touched?
[21:54:40] <kiassimilation> when one does an $.ajax(...).done(functon(data){...}) call, what type is "data"
[21:55:09] <b1lly> prefix: why don't you just set scrollTop(0)
[21:55:17] <coldhead> great work everyone
[21:55:20] <beachandbytes> kiassimilation object
[21:55:30] <prefix> might as well give it a shot
[21:56:18] <kiassimilation> beachandbytes, and how would i go about extracting all the bytes from this object?
[21:56:24] <b1lly> raj: it shouldn't
[21:56:40] <b1lly> raj: is your selector conflicting with children?
[21:57:51] <Aqeel> offset is if you have some element before the scrollable content view...else scrollTop is always zero
[21:57:57] <raj> b1lly, no
[21:58:10] <b1lly> Aqeel he should set the scrollTop to 0
[21:58:16] <b1lly> on html,body
[21:58:29] <b1lly> raj: can you show us a test case?
[21:58:32] <prefix> b1lly Aqeel $(scrollTarget).scrollTop(0) doesn't actually scroll to the top
[21:59:04] <WeThePeople> what is the name of the lightbox fade out called? into black?
[21:59:05] <Aqeel> ??
[21:59:06] <b1lly> prefix: use animate
[21:59:14] <b1lly> but set scrollTop : 0
[21:59:40] <b1lly> $('html,body').animate({scrollTop : 0}, 500});
[21:59:57] <b1lly> err
[22:00:03] <b1lly> $('html,body').animate({scrollTop : 0}, 500);
[22:00:06] <Aqeel> html body ... use scrollable element in question
[22:01:28] <prefix> hm
[22:01:35] <prefix> interesting
[22:02:12] <prefix> that could be a problem
[22:02:29] <b1lly> negative
[22:02:31] <b1lly> use html, body
[22:02:53] <prefix> well, this is drupal core code that I'm hackiong atm
[22:02:57] <b1lly> that is the scrollable element
[22:03:02] <b1lly> it doesnt matter
[22:03:07] <prefix> and hacking drupal core code is supposed to be a bad thing
[22:03:08] <b1lly> you want the main scroll bar to move to top
[22:03:22] <b1lly> you shouldn't ever hack core code in frameworks
[22:03:26] <b1lly> you should extend/override
[22:03:36] <Aqeel> yes true and agreed
[22:03:37] <prefix> as you said, setting $('html,body').animate({scrollTop : 0}, 500); works
[22:03:57] <b1lly> I know it does
[22:03:59] <b1lly> :P
[22:04:00] <prefix> but implementing this fix would be a core hack
[22:04:08] <prefix> so therein lies my problem
[22:04:19] <b1lly> unfortunatly
[22:04:26] <b1lly> I am not a drupal expert
[22:04:30] <b1lly> so I can't tell you what to do
[22:04:33] <b1lly> this is a jquery channel
[22:04:38] <prefix> yeah, I know
[22:04:42] <prefix> I'll figre it out
[22:04:43] <Aqeel> why not use both libraries
[22:04:51] <prefix> you've already been helpful
[22:05:24] <prefix> I imagine there's a proper manner for overriding this pager function
[22:05:29] <prefix> via a module
[22:05:35] * prefix goes to look
[22:05:49] <Aqeel> all libraries are extendable in my opinion
[22:06:17] <coldhead> often you need to buy more bookshelves
[22:06:49] <Aqeel> well i am done with my plugin enhancement....going github now
[22:06:54] <tw2113> coldhead, http://imgur.com/gallery/LoNFQ
[22:07:02] <Aqeel> everyhting works as wanted and expected..
[22:07:34] <Aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[22:07:40] <Aqeel> play with top buttons..
[22:07:56] <Aqeel> after loading first link from menu and submenu
[22:08:10] <kiassimilation> when one does an $.ajax(...).done(functon(data){...}) call, how does one get the binary representation of "data"?
[22:08:24] <Aqeel> and for fast forward and rewind, do hold down your mouse to see its functionality
[22:09:11] <coldhead> hahahah burritos
[22:09:15] <Aqeel> coldhead thanks for your great support for having me taken this far in this plugin
[22:10:24] <coldhead> Aqeel: i am always happy not to have to do any actual work myself
[22:10:34] <b1lly> kiassimilation: wy do you want the binary?
[22:11:23] <kiassimilation> b1lly, because the file is a binary file and i need to do analysis on the data
[22:13:01] <b1lly> I don't think there is built in functionality to convert (data) to binary
[22:13:34] <kiassimilation> i don't need to "convert" it
[22:13:40] <Aqeel> kiassimilation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11399484/posting-file-input-as-filereader-binary-data-through-ajax-post
[22:13:47] <sdwrage> Hey all. Has anyone here used ImageMapster? having an issue with replacing a map with another image and map
[22:14:00] <kiassimilation> i just need the raw representation of the data that is received from the GET request
[22:15:37] <Aqeel> kiassimilation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1919972/how-do-i-access-xhr-responsebody-for-binary-data-from-javascript-in-ie
[22:16:07] <coderhut> hello gurus. How can i access 4th meta element out of this string? http://pastie.org/5681572
[22:16:22] <b1lly> coderhut: .eq
[22:16:25] <b1lly> ()
[22:16:30] <kiassimilation> Aqeel, has jquery not been updated to do all this yet?
[22:16:31] <b1lly> or
[22:16:37] <b1lly> .last()
[22:16:51] <kiassimilation> i know this was a problem in 1.4-1.5, but i thought 1.8 has been updated to just handle binary data
[22:17:06] <Aqeel> kiassimilation: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-get-support-binary-type
[22:18:53] <Aqeel> kiassimilation: http://blog.vjeux.com/2011/javascript/jquery-binary-ajax.html
[22:19:26] <kiassimilation> Aqeel, i've read all these pages, actually
[22:19:38] <Aqeel> well then my guess is no..
[22:19:39] <coderhut> b1lly: console.log($(metas).find(meta).eq(3).attr(content)); this isnt working...
[22:19:47] <kiassimilation> i'll take another read through
[22:20:04] <coderhut> b1lly: i would like to access content of that meta. can you give an example please
[22:21:42] <b1lly> coderhut: wild shot -- what if you did $(metas).last().attr('content');
[22:21:57] <b1lly> or
[22:22:09] <b1lly> $(metas).eq(3).attr('content');
[22:23:08] <b1lly> is there a reason your dumping all these meta tags into a variable?
[22:23:43] <kiassimilation> Aqeel, actually, nevermind! i didn't see the top comment on vjeux's page that you last linked
[22:24:46] <b1lly> $('meta').eq(3).attr('content');
[22:24:47] <coderhut> b1lly: oh it did return the right result. but i just showed it in pastie.org for bravity reason. in actual variable metas are inside body tag...
[22:25:01] <b1lly> so you don't need that var metas =
[22:25:07] <b1lly> just do what i showed you above ^
[22:25:17] <coderhut> ahaan....
[22:25:22] <b1lly> coderhut: use jsfiddle
[22:25:26] <b1lly> for future references
[22:25:29] <b1lly> is better ;D
[22:32:45] <oojacoboo> any ideas why an ajax request to an rss (xml) file would continually be "cancelled" ?
[22:34:12] <coderhut> b1lly: thanks for all replies....i tried but still lacking something i think...i have repasted the actual html that variable contains.
[22:34:40] <b1lly> can you paste to jsfiddle please?
[22:39:20] <b1lly> coderhut: any luck?
[22:40:08] <paul_irish> i need a bug
[22:40:14] <paul_irish> anyone got buggy jquery?
[22:41:25] <coderhut> b1lly: here is jsfiddle link too... http://jsfiddle.net/UuE4j/
[22:41:35] <coderhut> thanks...
[22:41:46] <b1lly> paul_irish?
[22:41:51] <b1lly> the real paul?
[22:41:57] <paul_irish> yup
[22:42:06] <b1lly> *bow*
[22:46:48] <coderhut> b1lly: any hint? :)
[22:47:06] <coderhut> i have shared jsfiddle too
[22:47:55] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/EgRMT/
[22:48:28] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/EgRMT/1/ works fine
[22:49:33] <sam17me>   guys jsfiddle is amazing
[22:49:54] <coderhut> b1lly: but if i have that as part of variable because it responce of $.gter. then how can i access 4th or fith meta out of that variable?
[22:49:55] <sam17me>  I love the whole ( here's your shit ) about it
[22:51:23] <b1lly> coderhut: no clue what you said
[22:52:38] <coderhut> b1lly: the variable "metas" is result of a $,get from a url. so i would like to get 4th meta element out of that variable "metas"
[22:52:49] <coderhut> $.get
[22:58:10] <coderhut> in other words i want to get 4th meta from metas variable.
[23:03:39] <coderhut> reasking the question :).....how can i get 4th element from variable getResultedData as i have tried in this link:  http://jsfiddle.net/UuE4j/3/
[23:14:05] <Caustic> If I add a link with .prop('href', url) do I have to do anything special to make it clickable?
[23:14:50] <Cork> Caustic: uh, you're adding it to an a tag a assume?
[23:16:03] <Caustic> yeah
[23:16:22] <Cork> try attr('href', url)
[23:16:32] <Caustic> I did that first but it didn't work either
[23:16:42] <Caustic> I'm assuming that perhaps my css is screwy?
[23:16:45] <Cork> then you have something else preventidn it
[23:16:50] <Caustic> the element gets added fine and I can see it
[23:16:57] <Cork> you could have another element covering the link
[23:17:02] <Cork> like a div
[23:17:23] <Cork> use the inspector and see if what element you focus when you click at it
[23:18:26] <Caustic> I'll try that thanks
[23:30:23] <rakl> does jquery clone work in IE8? It wasn't working a second ago, I'm pushing a possible fix, but wanted to be sure of what the problem was before debugging the wrong thing
[23:35:08] <Cork> rakl: yes .clone should work in most any browsers
[23:35:18] <Cork> (not sure with ie<5.5)
[23:36:09] <rakl> Thanks Cork
[23:44:07] <martisj> anybody know how to debug unbalanced parens?
[23:44:11] <martisj> in someone elses code :S
[23:44:52] <martisj> I'm getting a Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ) 3:1
[23:44:58] <martisj> but there is no javascript on that line
[23:47:17] <kerozene> coderhut: $(getResultedData).filter('meta')[3]
[23:48:09] <coderhut> kerozene: thanks a lot!
[23:48:30] <martisj> seems to be gone now ;D
[23:48:30] <kerozene> np
[23:48:32] <martisj> :(
[23:48:33] <martisj> wtf
[23:49:19] <martisj> seems to be coming from javascript: void(0); in the href=""
[23:49:21] <martisj> wooot?
[23:50:18] <martisj> found it
[23:50:26] <martisj> it was href="javascript:void()"
[23:50:31] <martisj> lolcat stevens
[23:53:50] <jrockjiggz> hi. not very good with on(), but does it bind to future elements not yet in dom?
[23:54:35] <kerozene> lolyusuf islam
[23:55:38] <jrockjiggz> $('#nextCal').on('click', function(e){}); not binding to future elements?
[23:58:06] <mindis|wurk> jrockjiggz you need to find the closest static parent and assign .on to it instead
[23:58:37] <jrockjiggz> $(document).on('click','#nextCal', function(e){
[23:58:47] <jrockjiggz> static element or document?
[23:58:58] <jrockjiggz> thanks
[23:59:18] <mindis|wurk> a close parent would be preferable but that should work too
[23:59:52] <jrockjiggz> closest static element is the best explination, thanks, that works
