[01:05:34] <GoSox> what event would i use to catch the checking or unchecking, of a checkbox?
[01:06:48] <Agamemnus> .checked?
[01:06:51] <Agamemnus> .unchecked?
[01:07:10] <Agamemnus> no idea
[01:07:12] <Agamemnus> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[01:07:17] <Agamemnus> http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[01:07:21] <Agamemnus> .change ?
[01:07:31] <Agamemnus> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1455223/catch-checked-change-event-of-a-checkbox
[01:07:32] <GoSox> you know upon reflection, for what i'm doing, .click() is fine
[01:07:42] <GoSox> because i'm ultimately reloading the page anyway, so it doesn't really matter
[01:07:48] <Agamemnus> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[01:07:57] <Agamemnus> nah better use .change
[01:08:12] <GoSox> this is for a non-public use page, it doesn't need polish
[01:09:03] <Agamemnus> well, as you wish -- but change is better probably... goodnight
[02:36:59] <leosw> Hello world
[02:37:33] <leosw> I've a problem using ajax() or get() on jQuery 1.11
[02:38:02] <leosw> Both of them are returning errors but Firefox says me (using network console) that file was loaded with 200 status code
[02:44:08] <Nico90> hey guys. im trying to use a switch case from a select in the ui dialog title. the select is working but the switch case function is not working.  hier is my function: http://jsfiddle.net/vc7wrsk9/    any idea ?
[02:55:17] <fattest> why is my button (that is supposed to do nothing) triggering the show hide? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2651/
[03:00:31] <schnucki> why is the click handler on the tr?
[03:01:05] <schnucki> fattest
[03:02:38] <Nico90> fattest: u need to trigger the click function with a button id. for example you say : $(this).find('.button').toggleText("hide","show"); .. so.. all buttons are now connected with you toggle function
[03:03:14] <schnucki> this
[03:03:22] <fattest> schnucki: i want it on the tr but not the button that says "do nothing"
[03:03:36] <fattest> Nico90: i want it on tr too
[03:03:50] <schnucki> you need to be more specific, like Nico90 said
[03:04:30] <schnucki> why do you want it on tr?
[03:05:27] <schnucki> if you want the button to do nothing, add a click listener for it and stop the event from bubbling up
[03:06:10] <schnucki> because as it stands, you have a listener on thebuttons parent (tr) so even when you click on the button, the click event bubbles up the dom and fires the tr's event
[03:06:40] <fattest>  isee
[03:09:04] <fattest> schnucki: http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2655/ like that?
[03:10:47] <schnucki> yes
[03:15:26] <Nico90> hey guys. im trying to use a switch case from a select in the ui dialog title. the select is working but the switch case function is not working.  here is my function: http://jsfiddle.net/vc7wrsk9/    any idea ? dont know why jfiddle doesnt show the ui dialog. even with external ui jquery. but it is working except the switch case
[04:21:20] <CoffeeMarker> hey
[04:21:26] <CoffeeMarker> $('.get_table').on('click', function(){
[04:21:27] <CoffeeMarker> 	$.ajax({
[04:21:29] <CoffeeMarker> 		type: "GET",
[04:21:30] <CoffeeMarker> 		url: "http://localhost/english/functions/gettable.php",
[04:21:32] <CoffeeMarker> 		dataType: "xml",
[04:21:33] <CoffeeMarker> 		success: function(xml, $(this)){
[04:21:45] <CoffeeMarker> how can I send the clicked object unto the ajax success function?
[04:23:15] <jbw> $('.get_table').on('click', function(){ var $this = $(this);
[04:23:16] <jbw> ...
[04:23:39] <jbw> success: function(xml){  $this.remove(); ... }
[04:23:45] <jbw> or something like that ?
[04:25:01] <CoffeeMarker> great, that works, thx

[06:27:04] <leosw> Hello world
[06:27:34] <leosw> I've just finished a PHP API that outputs GeoJSON.
[06:27:56] <leosw> '1' mean Yes, '0' mean No and null means unknown
[06:27:57] <xpheres> hi
[06:28:21] <leosw> I'm using jQuery to get (via Ajax) that JSON file
[06:28:51] <xpheres> I want to make you a question, I managed to make a rotating quote function to show different tips, but I would like it to switch automatically without clicking on the link. I would be very happy if someone have a suggestion to resolve this problem.
[06:28:54] <xpheres> this is the tool: http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/translator.html
[06:29:05] <xpheres> and this is the function I need to improve: http://pastebin.com/D4ayEtKj
[06:29:11] <leosw> When I go inside the object, '1' becomes "1", '0' become '' and null becomes '' to
[06:29:28] <leosw> How can I make a difference between null and '0' ?
[06:30:13] <sacho> what's your library outputting
[06:31:51] <leosw> sacho, You're talking to me or xpheres ? :)
[06:34:00] <xpheres> leosw, no, I'm asking about a problem I have with a function
[06:41:08] <nico90> hey, can i use a onchange function from an dropdown in the ui dialog title ?  tried different methods, but it isnt working ;(
[06:50:50] <leosw> While $.get('file.json')
[06:51:10] <leosw> jQuery makes null to become "" and '0' to become ""
[06:51:55] <epistax> Hello folks! If this isn't a good jquery question, please direct me to a better place to ask.. I'm trying to make a div that is both draggable, and able to respond to click events. It seems when I set the draggable attribute, clicks no longer respond. I'm trying to replicate the behavior you'd see in a file/folder window (eg finder or explorer). Any thoughts?
[06:52:00] <Duikb00t> Who's good at bootstrap?
[06:52:06] <Duikb00t> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/1D4O  I made that setup ( small snipet )
[06:52:07] <xpheres> does anyone knows how to dynamically change a value with javascript in order to change a quote? thanks, that's my code: http://pastebin.com/D4ayEtKj
[06:52:39] <Duikb00t> What it the best way to fix the white margins from the col-md-8 element?
[06:53:10] <epistax> xpheres: What do you mean by 'dynamically' in this case? Is something not working in your pasted code?
[06:56:04] <xpheres> epistax please have a look at how to function behave here: http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/translator.html
[06:56:17] <xpheres> if you click on it, the quotes change everytime
[06:56:29] <xpheres> but I want to change by it self, without clicking on the icon
[06:57:10] <xpheres> I mean I want the character to change the quotes every few seconds
[06:57:34] <epistax> xpheres: If you'd like to have a function get called after a timeout, look at the setTimeout() method. You could have the message changes every 10 seconds that way, for example.
[06:58:08] <epistax> Oh I see you're using setInterval
[06:58:36] <xpheres> yes
[06:58:39] <xpheres> but the thing is
[06:58:54] <xpheres> that the popup doesn't change by itself, you have to click on it to togle it
[06:59:26] <epistax> xpheres: Move your call to setInterval to inside $(document).ready(function()
[06:59:41] <xpheres> ok...
[06:59:54] <xpheres> could you write on the paste bin how to do it?
[07:00:05] <xpheres> sorry is just that I'm not sure
[07:00:35] <xpheres> ah pastebin does not allow to colaborate
[07:02:57] <xpheres> I did it epistax
[07:03:03] <epistax> great
[07:03:26] <xpheres> I mean I inserted the call inside the document ready
[07:03:31] <xpheres> but it does not seem to work
[07:03:58] <epistax> Have you updated the page so I can see it?
[07:04:17] <xpheres> give me a second
[07:04:33] <xpheres> yes
[07:04:34] <xpheres> done
[07:06:22] <epistax> According to http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp setInterval takes a function, not a string. so try passing in just showQuote, rather than 'showQuote()'
[07:07:25] <xpheres> done
[07:08:32] <epistax> no, you're calling the function..
[07:08:58] <epistax> setInterval(showQuote(),speed) is going to call showQuote and pass the result to setInterval. You want to pass showQuote, the function itself, to setInterval.
[07:09:05] <epistax> So it's just setInterval(showQuote, speed)
[07:09:06] <xpheres> I was trying different options
[07:09:11] <xpheres> check it now please
[07:10:11] <epistax> showQuote is now being run every 3 seconds
[07:10:25] <epistax> You can verify that by placing a breakpoint in the function with your webbrowser
[07:13:32] <xpheres> but the quotes do not change
[07:14:25] <epistax> Yes, that function isn't working correctly, however it is now being called every three seconds.
[07:14:39] <xpheres> cool
[07:14:46] <epistax> You know the quote changes when you click it, so I'd try to figure out what's missing from the function
[07:14:47] <xpheres> then I'm closer to my purpose
[07:14:50] <epistax> yep
[07:14:51] <epistax> good luck
[07:14:54] <xpheres> thanks
[07:17:40] <epistax> Hey jQuery wizards: I know that live() was deprecated so I'm a little confused. I have a click a event set with $('.item-pad').click(func..) It works fine with any item-pad classed divs that exist from the start, but any divs produced later of that class don't respond to the event. What gives?
[07:19:30] <epistax> Thr divs are created using document.createElement and added to the dom with $('container').append. They do appear as expected.
[07:19:58] <epistax> And the class is set with $(new_item).addClass('item-pad')
[07:25:48] <CoffeeMarker> the event handler isnt bound to the class, its bound to the individual elements
[07:27:04] <epistax> CoffeeMarker: So previously live() was used to have it automatically latch onto any new elements created. Is this behavior meant to just be gone?
[07:28:36] <epistax> But thank you, that did lead to my solution. I just hook the click event up every time I create a new div of this type.
[07:30:11] <CoffeeMarker> I dont know
[07:30:35] <epistax> Thanks again. I'm in a starbucks and they like to disconnect the wifi for a few hundred milliseconds every hour or so
[07:35:15] <nico90> hey, can i use a onchange function from an dropdown in the ui dialog title ?  tried different methods, but it isnt working ;(
[07:44:37] <xpheres> I did it!
[07:44:43] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/translator.html
[07:44:47] <xpheres> epistax
[07:44:50] <xpheres> I found the mistake
[07:44:51] <xpheres> thanks
[07:45:15] <epistax> Great! Id suggest increasing the interval to at least 10 seconds
[07:45:29] <xpheres> no
[07:45:32] <epistax> hah
[07:45:34] <xpheres> that wasn't the problem
[07:45:39] <epistax> I know, it's just too fast,
[07:45:46] <xpheres> the problem was that the triggering was in the wrong place
[07:45:54] <xpheres> yes I will decrease it now
[07:46:37] <epistax> Very good. If you're not familiar with using your webbrowser as a debugger, I highly suggest you learn how to do so.
[07:46:43] <xpheres> thanks
[07:51:23] <epistax> I'm kind of curious from the experts, which browser gives the 'best' debugging capability. I've got Safari, Chrome, and Firefox immediately available.
[07:56:29] <fschuindt> Guys, I am using bootstrap + 1000hz validator, but in the validator docs I can't figure out how to handle the events, http://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/#validator-events I am trying like this: https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/36705b580a7916de8ce9 I am pretty bad in JavaScript, any help? :x
[08:00:28] <Velveeta> at a glance, that appears to be the correct usage
[08:00:45] <Velveeta> i'll dive into the validator code for a second and see if i can find out what's going on
[08:01:29] <Velveeta> is #new_user the form itself in your page?
[08:03:14] <Velveeta> epistax: personally, i prefer chrome's devtools.. firefoxes have gotten decent, but i still like chrome's the best
[08:04:38] <fschuindt> Velveeta: I have already seen the docs example, I have tried it with no success. Yes #new_user is my form, I will try to create a small js fiddle that reproducts the scenario.
[08:05:37] <Velveeta> fschuindt: i know you checked the docs already, i'm looking at the actual code to see what it's doing.. and you're firing this plugin on the form itself right? not on individual elements
[08:07:40] <fschuindt> Velveeta: yes, in the form itself.
[08:08:12] <fschuindt> Trying to figure out how to put bootstrap on jsfiddle, hahaha
[08:08:16] <Velveeta> weird, that *appears* to be how it's supposed to work
[08:08:27] <Velveeta> use the 'external resources' option in the left column
[08:08:37] <fschuindt> Velveeta: ok
[08:09:26] <fschuindt> Velveeta: I am forking a template
[08:10:43] <Velveeta> it appears that you instantiate it on the form itself, and it binds up an event listener on the form, which, on 'input.bs.validator change.bs.validator focusout.bs.validator', fires its validateInput function, which grabs the target of that event and uses it for validation, and triggers the invalid.bs.validator event on the form itself, with a 'relatedTarget' property that's the invalid field
[08:10:57] <Velveeta> i don't know if all of that printed or if it chopped my line in half
[08:12:45] <fschuindt> I guesst it printed, I am trying to understand haha
[08:13:19] <Velveeta> so basically, it looks like you're supposed to run that plugin on your form element, which you have
[08:13:40] <Velveeta> and then when it receives a change or focusout event from an input, it fires its validateInput function for that input
[08:13:46] <fschuindt> yes :/
[08:13:58] <rajlaksh> hi
[08:14:00] <Velveeta> if it fails to validate, it's supposed to emit the invalid.bs.validator event from the form element
[08:14:14] <Velveeta> so based on all of that, it *looks* like your code setup is correct
[08:14:23] <Velveeta> oh wait, just for fun, do this...
[08:14:41] <fschuindt> huum
[08:14:42] <rajlaksh> is there a way to replace id-1 when it click? id-2 when it click?
[08:14:43] <Velveeta> on the line above your $('#new_form').on statement, do this: console.log($('#new_form'))
[08:15:06] <Velveeta> rajlaksh: are you just asking you can change an element's id when it's clicked?
[08:15:41] <rajlaksh> yes, i tried replacewith
[08:16:00] <Velveeta> use .attr('id', <new id>)
[08:16:13] <fschuindt> Velveeta: I logged an big object
[08:16:37] <rajlaksh> ajax call return data so it will be reolacewith it.
[08:16:41] <Velveeta> fschuindt: damn, i was hoping it was a situation where the form object didn't exist at the time you were trying to bind an event listener to it
[08:17:01] <fschuindt> the browser reports that is from the file console.log($('#new_form'));
[08:17:02] <fschuindt> ops
[08:17:07] <aro> is there a way to defer the submission of a form?
[08:17:20] <fschuindt> validators-events
[08:17:23] <aro> like say a button to submit is clicked, i want a popup to show for 3s then continue submitting
[08:17:55] <Velveeta> rajlaksh: ok, if you're just trying to overwrite elements, then yes, replaceWith should work
[08:18:21] <Velveeta> aro: look into deferred objects
[08:18:34] <Velveeta> or just use setTimeout
[08:18:42] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[08:18:48] <rajlaksh> yeah i know but what element to put in replaceWidth?
[08:19:04] <aro> set timeout wont work
[08:19:18] <Velveeta> rajlaksh: if you're trying to replace element1 with element2, you would do $(element1).replaceWith(element2)
[08:19:23] <Velveeta> aro: why not?
[08:19:25] <aro> its ok, deferred will work
[08:19:26] <aro> because it wont
[08:19:32] <aro> because it doesnt preserve click state
[08:19:43] <aro> you lose the target of click and all that
[08:19:52] <Velveeta> why would you need to preserve click state to submit a form?
[08:19:58] <aro> why not?
[08:20:09] <aro> maybe you have multiple submit buttons that perform different actions
[08:20:16] <Velveeta> why do you keep answering my questions with vague responses and other questions? do you want help or no?
[08:20:38] <aro> because you are being condescending assuming that i only have one way to do what i want to do
[08:20:39] <rajlaksh> currently i'm using $('id-1').replaceWith('id-1'); id-1 is different from source id
[08:20:41] <Velveeta> if you need to preserve the event object for use in a setTimeout, just reference it in the closure scope
[08:21:24] <Velveeta> i'm not being condescending at all, you're giving me limited information to work off of... you're essentially saying "how do i do A?" <answer> "that won't work because B" <followup question> "because C"
[08:21:34] <aro> why does it matter if i want to preserve click state?
[08:21:35] <aro> anyways
[08:21:36] <rajlaksh> so it will replace with new ajax call
[08:21:47] <aro> dont worry about it, deferred will work - thank you for jogging my memory
[08:22:00] <Velveeta> you can't preserve click state anyway once the event loop exits
[08:22:16] <Velveeta> you can store data about it through to a lower closure scope, but you can't preserve that state
[08:22:58] <Velveeta> rejlaksh: you're trying to replace id-1 with id-1?
[08:23:08] <Velveeta> because up above, you said you were trying to replace id-1 with id-2
[08:24:01] <rajlaksh> yes with different call :) like 1st call is add 2nd call is remove
[08:24:25] <Velveeta> i'm still not sure exactly what you're trying to accomplish, can you post a code sample on jsfiddle or something?
[08:24:30] <rajlaksh> manual id is working
[08:25:47] <rajlaksh> like 1 page contain id-1 to id-20 so when i one of them so how to replace only it not all
[08:26:28] <rajlaksh> i can't type manullay :(
[08:26:37] <rajlaksh> manualy
[08:26:59] <Velveeta> to replace just one of them, just target it with $('#that-id').replaceWidth(whatever new content you want)
[08:27:06] <Velveeta> damnit, me
[08:27:11] <Velveeta> replaceWith, not replaceWidth
[08:27:44] <rajlaksh> i know. so i need to put 1 to 1 million js code for it?
[08:28:32] <rajlaksh> is there after selecter?
[08:30:19] <Velveeta> ok, so let me see if i understand this all correctly
[08:30:51] <Velveeta> you have a page with #id-1 through #id-N of elements, and when each one is clicked, you kick off an ajax request and pull in new content to replace just that element with
[08:31:18] <Velveeta> but you don't want to have to write click handlers for N elements (20, 100, 10000, 1000000, etc), you'd like to do it in a single one if possible
[08:31:27] <Velveeta> does that sound about right?
[08:44:59] <nonconvergent> Anyone know a way to compare two date strings?
[08:48:40] <phpcoder> hello everybody i have
[08:48:52] <phpcoder> $(".radio input[type=checkbox]").on('change'.....)
[08:49:11] <phpcoder> inside there i have i uncheck all the other checkbox
[08:49:18] <phpcoder> *checkboxes
[08:49:39] <phpcoder> how can i skip the checkbox relatd to $(this)
[09:02:14] <rajlaksh> @Velveeta yeah
[09:03:01] <rajlaksh> i need it for replaceWith onClick works good.
[09:03:13] <Velveeta> rajlaksh: don't rely on id's for those, or else you will need to use separate statements for each (unless you name them all consistently), use a class instead... you can use an id in addition if you want, but you would want a class for this purpose
[09:03:35] <Velveeta> you can do something like this: $('.replace-when-clicked').on('click', yourAjaxFunction);
[09:03:44] <rajlaksh> okay
[09:04:13] <Velveeta> within yourAjaxFunction, you can create a variable reference to the clicked object, like var $this = $(this), kick off your ajax request, and on success, do $this.replaceWith(newContent);
[09:04:45] <rajlaksh> ok, next step?
[09:04:48] <Velveeta> phpcoder: you can do $(':checkbox').not(this).prop('checked', false)
[09:04:55] <Velveeta> rajlaksh: that's all the steps you need
[09:05:40] <Velveeta> nonconvergent: i would make date objects out of those strings, and then you can use standard comparison operators, like: if (date1 < date2)
[09:08:04] <phpcoder> Velveeta, yeah!! i forgot .not() !!!
[09:08:05] <phpcoder> :D
[09:08:08] <phpcoder> thanks
[09:11:04] <Velveeta> no problemo
[09:11:27] <Velveeta> for anybody else's issues, i'm about to get going on some much needed house cleaning, so i'll just check back occasionally if there are followup questions
[09:12:47] <rajlaksh> thanks for your Hard Work Velveeta :)
[09:58:55] <jonano> how to do I like unlike like on facebook
[09:59:08] <jonano> I tried with unwrap
[09:59:12] <jonano> no success
[10:08:53] <Captain_Haddock> Is there some way that I can check if jQuery UI is currently included? (using code)
[10:08:58] <Captain_Haddock> or what version it is?
[10:16:31] <FilipNortic> jQuery.ui.version
[10:17:13] <FilipNortic> if it returns undefined it is not loaded
[10:58:41] <stangeland> How do i replace linefeed (0x0a) with '</li><li>' in a string in jq?
[10:59:23] <Captain_Haddock> FilipNortic: Cheers :)
[11:12:06] <Velveeta> stangeland: i'm not sure about that hex code, but you can try a string replace of "\n" with your li replacement
[11:12:44] <stangeland> yeah i had to do split and then join....replace did not work for some reason....but \n == 0x0a
[11:12:47] <stangeland> thx
[11:12:53] <Velveeta> gotcha
[11:15:56] <ggdevelop> Hi, I have table in my page with input tag. and whan it load the page scroll down to this input feild. I dont want the page will scroll down. how do I prevent that?
[11:17:16] <DavidCruse> Hello there! On input in an input field, I'm trying to give an alert box. I know its really nothing to do but I'm not getting why isn't it working. even the browser console is showing nothing. :( Please help me debug
[11:17:51] <DavidCruse> This is the input field: <input type="number" id="promotion_{{value.id}}" class="promotion" value = {{value.basic_wage}}>
[11:18:41] <DavidCruse> And the Jquery: http://pastie.org/9896080
[11:27:26] <DavidCruse> Thanks, I got the solution :P
[11:32:25] <reynierpm> Hi, I have some doubts around function and vars scope and need some advice from people here
[11:33:07] <reynierpm> first, take a look to this code http://jsbin.com/demafemiwe/1/edit?js,console,output I have declared a function outside $(document).ready and access it inside
[11:33:23] <reynierpm> Apparently I can access arrVar but can not access someFunction2
[11:33:27] <reynierpm> why?
[11:36:28] <shoky> reynierpm:   arrVar = []   creates a global arrVar variable and assigns it to an empty array.   so you can do that even if there isn't a local arrVar defined. but you can't do someFunction2()  if there isn't a function called someFunction2 in scope
[11:37:13] <shoky> reynierpm: so "arrVar = []"  doesn't really access any existing arrVar, it creates one, globally. (use "var" to create locally scoped variables)
[11:38:13] <reynierpm> shoky so I am doing wrong, what I need to achieve with this? Any time user refresh the page clear all the vars inside $(document).ready and for that I have created the function outside
[11:38:26] <reynierpm> shoky what is the right way to get this done?
[11:39:02] <shoky> reynierpm: huh.. vars are cleared anyway when the user refreshes..
[11:40:08] <shoky> reynierpm: anyway if you want someFunction to have access to the local scope of the $(document).ready( function, then put someFunction inside there as well..
[11:40:12] <reynierpm> shoky so this is right http://jsbin.com/demafemiwe/1/edit?js,console,output ?
[11:40:50] <reynierpm> shoky anytime user refresh page vars will be cleared?
[11:40:59] <shoky> no. that still creates a global arrVar (the arrVar=[] line)
[11:41:10] <shoky> i have no idea what you want to do ..
[11:41:23] <shoky> you don't need to handle a refresh
[11:42:11] <reynierpm> Yes I need because I am working with a wizard and then vars needs to be cleared
[11:42:45] <reynierpm> nevermind, thanks for your help shoky I will try to get this done on my own
[11:46:31] <Kazuto> I'm using jQuery for the first time in my script. My IDE (PhpStorm) is telling me that "$ is unresolved/undefined" when I try to reference it with document load. I have my script loaded after jQuery. Do I have to create any variables or anything before using jQuery?
[11:53:37] <Captain_Haddock> Kazuto: Use a browser to test your code. You can also try something like http://jsfiddle.net/ to test your script.
[11:55:19] <Kazuto> Captain_Haddock: Oh, nevermind. I had a stupid typo when referencing jQuery. Lol, thanks for the help anyway
[12:09:05] <kwladyka> i am looking 2 days image gallery exatly like on site https://www.airbnb.pl/rooms/1620835?s=k8Fj and cant finde.... mayby do you know plugin like that?
[12:45:52] <jrkie> hey
[12:45:59] <jrkie> how can i get to know which javascript function is fired off when i click this class, it's: <a class="ui-accordian__trigger ui-media" href="#">, when i open event listeners i see a global javascipt of anything on the page, i just want that class
[13:22:26] <xenaxon> anybody has any idea how to crop an image into a hexagonal shape?
[14:20:57] <jonano> why I get 2 mysql query when they are seperated by if and else ? --> http://pastebin.com/Lf97pUks
[14:21:42] <jonano> I cant insert or delete they do 2 mysql query
[14:24:20] <phiz> jonano: that PHP code is going to get ran before the JS
[14:24:41] <jonano> and so ? what should I do
[14:24:42] <phiz> because the PHP code gets ran on the server side before your browser sees it.
[14:26:01] <phiz> you ned to use an ajax call
[14:26:28] <phiz> such as discussed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8379058/using-php-in-javascripts-if-statement
[14:26:32] <phiz> need*
[14:26:38] <jonano> ok
[14:28:17] <phiz> before reading that you need to understand that PHP code gets executed on the server and JavaScript code gets executed by your browser.
[14:42:51] <jonano> I need to do an http request (ajax) right ?
[14:42:57] <jonano> how to do so
[14:45:57] <jonano> I need to do this ? --> $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH']
[14:53:00] <Jacob_Bolda> Hello, I am doing a $.post(), what do I need to send back to let the function know that it was successful?
[14:54:34] <systemfault> Jacob_Bolda: The function takes a callback parameter you can use for that purpose.
[14:58:37] <Jacob_Bolda> so I have:
[14:58:38] <Jacob_Bolda>             $.post("/ticker/request", jsondata, function(returnedData) {
[14:58:46] <Jacob_Bolda>                 console.log('returned:');                 console.log(returnedData);
[14:58:53] <Jacob_Bolda>             }, "json").fail(function(){console.log('fail'); console.log(jsondata);});
[14:59:47] <Jacob_Bolda> systemfault: so that function is the success callback, yea?
[15:00:34] <systemfault> Yes
[15:00:58] <Jacob_Bolda> systemfault: well, the console is always returning "fail" for that code
[15:02:34] <systemfault> Well, it could be because the request failed, no?
[15:02:39] <systemfault> Also, you should consider using the promise interface for both success and failure
[15:03:30] <Jacob_Bolda> systemfault: I didn't think that had reached widespread support yet?
[15:03:34] <systemfault>  $.post("/ticker/request", jsondata, 'json').done(function(data) { console.log('win'); }).fail(function() { console.log('fail'); });
[15:03:54] <systemfault> Jacob_Bolda: I'm not talking about ES6 promises, just the normal jQuery one.
[15:04:34] <systemfault> Jacob_Bolda: jQuery has a basic promise implementation built-in, it's used for things like ajax
[15:04:49] <systemfault> $.post() returns a jQuery promise
[15:04:51] <Jacob_Bolda> systemfault: TIL, lol
[15:09:59] <Jacob_Bolda> systemfault: was your example using the promises?
[15:10:12] <Jacob_Bolda> I will put it on the todo list to check out the jquery promises
[15:10:19] <Jacob_Bolda> otherwise it works a fancy, thanks much
[15:10:56] <systemfault> Yes, my example uses jQuery promises.
[15:13:27] <nickse> if($('.item-input').is(':focus')) { } Does this mean when input is active?
[15:17:22] <guzzlefry> nickse: what are you trying to do with that?
[15:17:55] <nickse> guzzlefry When input text is active, I would like background color to change.
[15:18:11] <nickse> if($('.item-input').is(':focus')) {  $(this).addClass("focus"); }
[15:18:16] <nickse> This don't seem to work
[15:27:02] <guzzlefry> nickse: use CSS for that
[15:27:25] <nickse> I did
[15:27:36] <nickse> .focus is in the css
[15:27:36] <guzzlefry> Then why are you asking about javascript?
[15:28:19] <guzzlefry> nickse: http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:28:20] <nickse> Because background color is not changed when the input is focus.
[15:40:24] <jonano> I could use knex to insert stuff in my db using javascript
[15:52:31] <ThePendulum> Does anyone know what would be the best way to get the ID of the last li from my list?
[15:52:38] <ThePendulum> And compare it
[15:55:45] <ThePendulum> nvm, fixed :)
[16:04:01] <Primero> how can i "maximize" a modal to fit browser ?
[16:25:47] <Mark_2> anybody alive?
[16:28:51] <jonano> see my 2 files: see ajax, I see courriel not defined why and my query is not working: http://pastebin.com/4MpMnqtB | http://pastebin.com/whS9vNzk why its not working
[16:31:39] <Mark_2> can anybody figure out why my ajax content is not showing here? http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/
[16:31:44] <Mark_2> if you click on the button *
[16:38:41] <zagaza> hi guys.. when I scroll this to the end right, it keeps going (pushing the picture way left). I want it to have a 20px margin from the right "wall". If someone knows what I mean.. can you help me figure it out? http://jsfiddle.net/dxjdj9yb/
[17:09:33] <Picarda27> Anyone did a curl html parser here? I'm looking to grab some DIV frome a specific website...
[17:57:21] <stephen> Are there any channels here that are strictly about UI design?
[18:03:12] <tomasm-> anyone know of a jquery library that handles JSON form submission (not just intercepting a form but also the response) - specifically within bootstrap's modals/dialogs? Or is that something I need to implement myself?
[18:56:45] <nickyd> Hi all... looking for a little help with a CSS selector that's driving me nuts. Basically i've got a div in a page, and I just want to select the content in the div that's not inside a span http://pastebin.com/WZySB3nA
[18:57:02] <nickyd> i tried .not(.classname) for the span classes
[18:57:04] <nickyd> but no luck
[19:07:12] <jonathan_> it's ok
[19:07:12] <jonathan_> ;)
[19:07:27] <gnarf> nickyd: select with what?
[19:07:34] <gnarf> nickyd: are you trying to just get the text?
[19:07:37] <nickyd> correct
[19:07:43] <nickyd> but i want to ignore what's inside the spans
[19:07:47] <gnarf> nickyd: it's actually not "selectable"
[19:07:49] <gnarf> but you could do
[19:08:01] <nickyd> Yeah, I know I can do it with xpath, didn't know if it was possible with css selectors
[19:08:31] <gnarf> var clone = $div.clone(); clone.find('span').remove(); clone.text()
[19:09:00] <gnarf> nickyd: probably easier to just put that other text in a span in your template tho
[19:09:01] <gnarf> :)
[19:09:17] <nickyd> Yeah, I'm actually scraping a page with that on it
[19:09:22] <nickyd> So I have no control over it :(
[19:09:30] <gnarf> nickyd: so clone the div, remove the spans, and read the text
[19:09:33] <gnarf> p simple
[19:09:39] <nickyd> Thanks, ill give it a whirl :)
[19:10:27] <gnarf> tomasm-: ajaxForm is basically the only "jquery plugin" i used for forms
[19:10:37] <gnarf> its pretty powerful but doesn't quite doo what you were looking for
[19:11:02] <gnarf> prolly gonna need to roll your own sort of thing for that but you might want to ask over in #documentcloud or #backbone or wherever backboners hang out
[20:30:15] <CoffeeMarker> <div><div data-id="991">allow </div></div>
[20:30:41] <CoffeeMarker> I get the following xml code with an ajax call
[20:31:00] <CoffeeMarker> is there an easy way to just attach that to my dom as it is?
[20:56:13] <CoffeeMarker> ok, got it by getting it as text and setting it as html
[21:03:08] <MXBrandon2> How can I make .ajax() send my data as a raw string instead of in the post headers?
[23:21:05] <paul_irish> how does one get mp3s these days?
[23:21:46] * paul_irish is aware this is crazy offtopic. i'm just hoping to find someone who is up.
[23:21:52] * paul_irish is on russian timezone right n ow
[23:26:45] <sacho> it feels like everyone just listens to music streams instead
[23:30:20] <paul_irish> sacho: yah.
[23:30:37] <paul_irish> i can turn an itunes purchase into mp3
[23:30:51] <paul_irish> but buying from itunes feels so so weird.
[23:32:50] <cavestory> Hey! Anyone know how to parse a variable containing html for a specific link which container a needed number
[23:33:01] <cavestory> basically parse html using jquery
[23:33:13] <paul_irish> cavestory: havent you seen that SO answer on parsing HTML
[23:33:27] <cavestory> ive been trying tons of methods
[23:33:34] <paul_irish> :p
[23:33:37] <cavestory> maybe a link?
[23:33:49] <sacho> $(html).find('a')...didn't understand the rest of what you said
[23:34:06] <paul_irish> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454
[23:34:11] <cavestory> find just gives a true or false right?
[23:34:21] <cavestory> paul_irish: let me take a look
[23:34:22] <sacho> what makes you think that
[23:34:25] <paul_irish> :p
[23:34:29] <paul_irish> find returns an element babydoll
[23:34:30] <Mark_2> hmm
[23:34:34] <Mark_2> and then?
[23:34:34] <paul_irish> or set of elements
[23:35:29] <paul_irish> sacho: im using soulseek now.
[23:35:38] <Mark_2> what is soulseek
[23:35:45] <cavestory> paul_irish: thanks for that :)
[23:35:57] <cavestory> sacho: let me try using find again
[23:35:57] <paul_irish> you're very welcome
[23:36:38] <paul_irish> cavestory: the tldr is is $(yourstringvariable)  returns a big DOM chunk and then you .find() on that and you get get to the actual element you want
[23:37:01] <paul_irish> jquery handles the HTML string into DOM magic for you
[23:37:20] <paul_irish> and then you got elements. everybody knows elements are cooler friends than string assholes
[23:37:25] <cavestory> right, what happens when in the div.<classname>. The classname has spaces in it
[23:37:46] <Mark_2> is there anyway i can load ajax contents without being refreshed?
[23:38:20] <cavestory> data.find('href.this is the class name');
[23:38:44] <paul_irish> that means it has multiple classes
[23:38:54] <cavestory> :)
[23:39:01] <paul_irish> so the selector you use will be for ONE of those classes, usually
[23:39:12] <sacho> cavestory, href is not a dom element
[23:39:20] <paul_irish> data.find('a.this')
[23:39:22] <cavestory> i meant div
[23:39:23] <cavestory> sry
[23:39:31] <paul_irish> but if you're crazy you could match for multiple of the classes like so
[23:39:36] <sacho> cavestory, $('div.oneclass.twoclass.threeclass')
[23:39:38] <paul_irish> data.find('a.this.are.some.classes')
[23:39:47] <paul_irish> but thats crazy but i can tell you're crazy so you might as well.
[23:39:53] <cavestory> love you guys , let me give it a shot
[23:39:59] <paul_irish> Mark_2: definitely.
[23:40:12] <Mark_2> for instance, http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/ this page uses ajax
[23:40:27] <paul_irish> Mark_2: i bet your ajax payload has some <script> or some bullshit and inside of there the script is forcing a navigation
[23:40:37] <Mark_2> but if i put a keyword on the searchbar and hit enter it has to refresh.
[23:40:48] <Mark_2> hmm not exactly.
[23:47:48] <paul_irish> Mark_2: put your thing online
[23:48:01] <Mark_2> you mean js fiddle?
[23:48:16] <Mark_2> and he left.
[23:48:43] <Mark_2> whatâ€™s the difference between jquery ajax .load vs iframe?
[23:52:49] <cavestory>  sacho:  success: function(data) {   value = data.find('a.this.is.all.the.classes');    console.log(value);
[23:52:55] <cavestory> sacho: give me has no method find
[23:54:03] <sacho> because data isn't a jquery object
