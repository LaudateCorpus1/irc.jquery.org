[00:24:43] <droptone> back
[00:24:46] <droptone> had to put my kids to bed
[00:24:48] <droptone> deryco: trying
[00:28:36] <droptone> deryco: that calls the function on select box change without error, I added a test console.log, but it doesn't alter the values
[00:30:35] <droptone> If I put a console.log line after every line of code for testing, it appears this line generates no output after: $(this).siblings().each(function() {
[00:30:43] <droptone> indicating the this.siblings finds no values
[00:32:27] <droptone> all the select boxes in the table have the same class, but different IDs
[00:37:46] <droptone> So now it's not erroring out, and I confirmed current has the right value, the value of the select box
[00:38:17] <droptone> The only remaining issue is iterating over the other select boxes in the other rows, all of which have the same class but differnet ids
[00:38:28] <droptone> no idea why .siblings isn't finding them
[01:04:31] <droptone> good lord why is this so difficult
[01:17:53] <droptone> is there a way to simply specify one row to iterate through
[01:18:04] <droptone> like I have this now: (".cl_pait_url_map_table").find("td").each(function(i){
[01:18:10] <droptone> but I only want to look at the td values in the second column
[01:18:14] <droptone> I mean column, not row
[01:19:39] <droptone> this is insane
[09:12:44] <St0n3-C0l> I need help with finding current index number when parsing through JSON object which I have built as an array.....using for in function to iterate and check for the matching value within the object but I also need to know the index number. index() keeps telling me that it is not a function which is weird.
[09:13:51] <St0n3-C0l> $.inArray() didn't help much either....returns -1
[10:04:04] <robhol> doesn't the .each function take a callback with both index and element as parameters?
[11:44:24] <wfq> hi all
[11:46:04] <wfq> could anyone please let me know why on earth the rule "fuckSake" is reporting all the time "TypeError: a.validator.methods[d] is undefined" on this script http://pastebin.com/6xH6BcAL?
[11:46:23] <wfq> however the other rule isEmailValid works well.
[11:52:50] <wfq> oh god, just realised that it could be any rubbish around
[11:58:55] <wfq> no a single fucking clue
[12:46:56] <mariacheline> hi
[12:47:03] <mariacheline> Can somebody help?
[12:47:36] <mariacheline> http://codepen.io/mariacheline/pen/zqMKGo i don't get why this isn't working...
[12:57:56] <VectorX> mariacheline you have $('form') but there is no <form> in your html
[12:58:18] <VectorX> first put a form tag around inputs to make it a actual form
[12:58:33] <VectorX> you can also just do a click event on the submit button isntead
[12:59:02] <mariacheline> Oh.. right >.>
[12:59:08] <VectorX> then in the .find specify the exact object for the input, ie .find('#field');
[13:10:04] <mariacheline> Thank you Vectorx! :-)
[13:16:15] <VectorX> mariacheline np
[15:36:00] <Jeroen__> Hi there, I'm getting this error (jquery-1.9.1.js:8526 GET http://www.url.nl/index.php 500 (Internal Server Error)) on $(".updateInfo").load("index.php .refresh");. It did work always but just now without updating anything it gives an error. Anyone knows how to fix this?
[15:36:15] <Jeroen__> It should just refresh a div
[16:28:47] <Sander^home> Is jquery dependent on starting it from a server? Or can I start it from localhost too?
[16:29:18] <Sander^home> And in case, what parts dosnt work then?
[16:32:56] <Sander^home> I think I got it: https://www.codecademy.com/forum_questions/51205802e1738f7cce000002
[17:35:19] <edufmass> Hello, with console.debug(btn) I get <a data-vacid="8" onclick="Eliminar(this);">, I tried btn.data('vacid') but I don't get the number 8, how can I solve this? I want a <a> tag without href and use onclick event
[18:34:05] <BobbyMcWho> Okay so I am having an issue getting my encodeURIComponent to add to this string

[18:58:40] <ngc0202> Hi
[18:59:15] <ngc0202> Should this not work for the multiple elements the selector finds? It seems to only be triggering on the first one:
[18:59:21] <ngc0202> $("#plList div a").click(function (e) { .. }
[19:00:43] <ngc0202> It's definitely returning both of my two elements, yet my breakpoint in the click function only triggers for the first one
[19:58:24] <z1haze> ive got an issue with datatables not sorting a numeric column correctly. it doesnt seem like its sorting it at all actually, any ideas?
[19:58:47] <z1haze> its starting saying 10, 11, 12, etc
[21:31:48] <nexace_> if I wanted to delay a css change could I do $divID.delay(800).css("display","none");
[21:31:51] <nexace_> ?
[21:32:09] <taplar> no, delay is for animations and things like that
[21:33:53] <rickymiller> nexace_: you can just wrap w/ setTimeout
[21:37:11] <rickymiller> eg: setTimeout(function() { $divID.css("display","none") }, 2000)
[21:42:46] <Taylor_Karras> hey, anybody here?
[21:48:01] <taplar> a few
[21:48:01] <nexace_> rickymiller: thanks man
[23:09:09] <manman> hello
