[12:01:12] <Cypris2342> Quick question, when $("div").attr("data-name","value") executes, does jQuery attempt to set div's which already have attribute "data-name" with a value of "value" OR does it skip over them?
[12:02:41] <shoky> Cypris2342: it does not skip them
[12:04:54] <Cypris2342> kinda what I thought
