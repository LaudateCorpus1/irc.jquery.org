[00:40:08] <ChicagoNathan> Is there a way to select an html tag that looks like this: "<span sometext>"?
[00:40:38] <ChicagoNathan> I don't even know what to call that "sometext" to search for it.
[00:41:06] <robertmaxrees> what is the actual 'sometext' in your case?
[00:41:27] <ChicagoNathan> "data-ad-date"
[00:41:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a data attribute.
[00:41:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[00:42:05] <ChicagoNathan> Ok, I can look that up.  Do you know offhand what a selector for that would be?
[00:42:07] <robertmaxrees> you can use $('span["data-ad-date"]') or use .filter() with a function that checks for .data('adDate')
[00:45:57] <robertmaxrees> ah wait it's just $('span[data-ad-date}');
[00:45:59] <robertmaxrees> my bad
[02:37:24] <dimi1947> I have a series of input elemens(same name attribute)different ID...I want to target all of them except a speccific ID...what to use better...filter or not?
[02:37:50] <robertmaxrees> Why to your inputs all have the same name in this case?
[02:37:53] <robertmaxrees> *do
[02:38:28] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://api.jquery.com/not/ it probably your best bet.
[02:38:51] <robertmaxrees> though sharing a name attribute is... funky.
[02:39:03] <Cork> unless they are radio boxes
[02:39:15] <dimi1947> THEY ARE RADIO BOXES
[02:39:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ do you want the selected radio box??
[02:39:30] <Cork> and not and filter is the same thing, :not() is not something that works in querySelector so jquery has to emulate it
[02:39:43] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i was suggesting the .not() method ;)
[02:40:02] <robertmaxrees> but .filter() is your general purpose method for this kind of work.
[02:40:08] <Cork> ya, just wanted to note that :psudo doesn't work in querySelector
[02:40:20] <Cork> so it is all js filtering
[02:40:21] <robertmaxrees> fair.
[02:40:42] <dimi1947> so go for filter()...?
[02:40:56] <Cork> anyway for radio buttons i would use :checked
[02:41:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[02:41:05] <Cork> as you can only have one of them at a time
[02:41:19] <robertmaxrees> all depends on what your end goal is.
[02:42:10] <dimi1947> the purpose is that when all of the radio buttons are checked(except one) an action is performed
[02:42:23] <Cork> O_o
[02:42:26] <robertmaxrees> wait huh?
[02:42:29] <Cork> thats a checkbox not a radio...
[02:42:58] <dimi1947> no input type radio https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/Lnt74wje/66/
[02:43:10] <Cork> yes but radio can only have one checked element
[02:43:13] <Cork> it is the point of radio
[02:43:29] <Cork> if you want multiple you should use checkboxes
[02:43:32] <dimi1947> I know
[02:43:39] <robertmaxrees> obviously you don't
[02:43:53] <robertmaxrees> single you're trying to do something out of spec with them.
[02:43:59] <dimi1947> I restate the problem
[02:44:04] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you want to treat a particular radio differently?
[02:44:33] <dimi1947> no give me a second to restate the problem more precisely
[02:45:41] <dimi1947> whenever the user selects a radio button other than doctor(see the fiddle for the choices) an action is performed...is that clear now?
[02:45:54] <robertmaxrees> that is literally what i just said.
[02:46:05] <dimi1947> correct
[02:46:17] <robertmaxrees> you want to check $(this).is('#foo')
[02:46:27] <robertmaxrees> bind a general listener and add that check in.
[02:46:28] <robertmaxrees> done
[02:47:18] <Cork> or give the doctor a class and partent.on('click', ':radio:not(.doctor)', func)
[02:47:44] <Cork> don't remember if jquery call it :radio or :radiobox...
[02:47:58] <dimi1947> I think that last one is better
[02:48:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this.  though if you have any other logic that applies to them all collectively and you just want to exclude some particular logic from that one case, go with the check in logic.
[02:48:34] <Cork> ya, you don't want to use multiple event handlers for the same thing
[02:48:38] <Cork> that becomes a mess fast
[02:48:47] <robertmaxrees> ^ also makes your intent far clearer.
[02:49:01] <dimi1947> where do we conclude?
[02:49:03] <robertmaxrees> move logic out of selectors when you can.
[02:49:27] <robertmaxrees> do you have code that's being run regardless of which radio is chosen?
[02:50:07] <dimi1947> I have code that runs when the doctor radio button is chosen...see the fiddle
[02:50:23] <robertmaxrees> your giddle isn't clear.
[02:50:38] <robertmaxrees> it's just saying "on change, remove one thing and add another".
[02:50:41] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle
[02:50:49] <robertmaxrees> is there other logic in your code you're concerned with?
[02:50:52] <dimi1947> give me a second
[02:51:38] <robertmaxrees> also: your code is strange.  wrap those labels around those radios and ditch the for attribues - for is supposed to correspond with a particular input.
[02:51:43] <robertmaxrees> which these don't.
[02:52:36] <robertmaxrees> also: don't inject markup here - put the markup in the page and show/hide it along with enabling/disabling it instead.
[02:53:10] <dimi1947> when you say here...you mean in the channel?
[02:53:23] <robertmaxrees> "here" as in "in your use case"
[02:53:25] <Cork> well for is fine, it needs to match the id of the input if used though
[02:53:40] <Cork> else it is just noice
[02:53:42] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.  or just wrap the label around the appropriate input.
[02:53:58] <Cork> that doesn't always work though, depending on the layout
[02:54:11] <robertmaxrees> it works in 99% of cases I've seen...
[02:54:19] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/hobpzruc/2/
[02:54:22] <robertmaxrees> in fact, it's never not worked.
[02:54:27] <robertmaxrees> for me at least.
[02:54:29] <dimi1947> it is clearer now
[02:54:44] <dimi1947> click the radio doctor to see what happens
[02:54:55] <Cork> robertmaxrees: framworks that generates the form fields can't have fields inside lables (rails is a fairly big example)
[02:55:21] <Cork> and if you want to have css filters based on the input state you want the label after it not around it
[02:55:35] <robertmaxrees> there's a better way to manage this imho
[02:55:49] <dimi1947> when the user clicks a radio othen than doctor make the search box disappear
[02:56:01] <dimi1947> that ia the goal
[02:56:25] <Cork> if you don't have a normal click handler for those inputs i would use the delegate solution
[02:56:27] <robertmaxrees> even better - why not just always how the search input? :)
[02:56:43] <dimi1947> hmmm
[02:56:59] <dimi1947> I suppose how=show
[02:57:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[02:57:47] <dimi1947> then I will go for this....have the search box appear all the time
[02:58:01] <robertmaxrees> alternatively - one sec.
[02:59:15] <dimi1947> I think that not having appear it all the time makes for a cleaner UI
[02:59:36] <robertmaxrees> sure.  lemme show you another way for this :)
[03:03:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zkq8sx42/
[03:04:59] <dimi1947> hmmm....that does it
[03:05:25] <dimi1947> it did crossed my mindd at some point...
[03:05:31] <robertmaxrees> why "hmmm"???
[03:06:20] <dimi1947> it is not important....does on listens for event?
[03:06:34] <dimi1947> ...in general?
[03:06:46] <robertmaxrees> .on() is for event listeners, yes.
[03:06:48] <robertmaxrees> go check the docs.
[03:07:03] <robertmaxrees> it's what .click(), .change(), etc use, basically.
[03:09:13] <dimi1947> a cooment: I though that label must have the for attribute
[03:09:32] <Cork> the input has to be inside it, or you have to use for
[03:09:33] <robertmaxrees> they don't.  and in this case, they break the intended functionality.
[03:09:43] <robertmaxrees> ^^ Cork has it.
[03:09:54] <robertmaxrees> you weren't using the for attribute correctly.
[03:10:00] <robertmaxrees> so get rid of it.
[03:10:22] <robertmaxrees> you also need the generic event handler in this instance since you want to hide/show that text input
[03:10:59] <robertmaxrees> off to bed.  enjoy, folks :)
[11:05:00] <goddard> i have a ajax that loads a page and that page has some more jquery, but for some reason my button on click isn't being triggered.
[11:05:19] <goddard> i have it inside a document ready wrap
[12:08:10] <goddard> js s/j #hardware
[13:00:19] <jak2000> with jquery is possible extract data from excel file? (xlsx) ?
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> nope
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 jquery is a DOM abstraction library.  why would it handle excel files??
[14:00:54] <Robdgreat> I was really hoping to find out the answer to this
[14:01:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:09:13] <v0lZy> hi
[19:09:37] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[19:09:39] <v0lZy> i wodner if somone can help me with referencing an embeded file from jquery
[19:09:48] <v0lZy> I'm trying to use particleJS
[19:09:50] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask, just ask :)
[19:10:34] <v0lZy> I'm basically using particle.js as a base64 embeded file.... now next to it i have to embed a json file and then from jqeury call that embeded file
[19:10:36] <v0lZy> particlesJS.load('particles-js', 'particles.json', function() {
[19:10:36] <v0lZy>   console.log('callback - particles.js config loaded');
[19:10:37] <v0lZy> });
[19:10:47] <robertmaxrees> hey so avoid pasting code into the channel - use jsfiddle instead :)
[19:10:51] <v0lZy> this would be how its normally called ... need to replace 'particles.json' up there somehow with what i've embeded.
[19:11:01] <robertmaxrees> when you say "embedded file", what do you mean?
[19:11:39] <v0lZy> I mean, <script src="data:application/x-javascript;base64,Lyo...=="></script>
[19:12:13] <robertmaxrees> so you want to select a script tag that has its source set to a data ui?
[19:13:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd give it a class and then check the .prop('src') or .attr('src') and see if that gets you what you need.
[19:15:27] <v0lZy> so, like add <script id='jsonconf' src= ... and then instead of 'particles.json' #jsonconf.attr('src') ?ž
[19:15:40] <v0lZy> (sorry, not big on js acutually... forgot how one calls a class... is is $?
[19:15:42] <robertmaxrees> that may or may not work.
[19:15:53] <robertmaxrees> it depends on what that library expects.
[19:16:13] <v0lZy> i guess it expects a file
[19:16:18] <v0lZy> blob
[19:16:20] <robertmaxrees> link to the docs?
[19:16:56] <v0lZy> I'm purely guessing because the idea is that you place a file in afolder and then supply the file as a parameter to the function... that function either does an include or a read..
[19:16:58] <v0lZy> mmm
[19:17:34] <v0lZy> https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/
[19:17:35] <robertmaxrees> and to select an ID via jquery, it's $('#foo').  if you instead put it in the class attribute, it'd be $('.foo')
[19:17:52] <robertmaxrees> erm
[19:18:21] <robertmaxrees> you sure you can't just feed it an object instead?
[19:19:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can.  that's what the codepen does.
[19:19:32] <v0lZy> so how would i feed it the json object?
[19:20:09] <robertmaxrees> you'd stick the object onto the page and pass it as the second arg.
[19:20:11] <v0lZy> like
[19:20:17] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/pen/
[19:20:19] <robertmaxrees> woops
[19:20:19] <v0lZy> <script> myobject = { ..json }
[19:20:43] <robertmaxrees> var myObject = {whatever data here.};
[19:21:02] <robertmaxrees> and then particlesJS("particles-js", myObject);
[19:21:23] <robertmaxrees> (you always want var, let, or const - never declare without one)
[19:21:40] <v0lZy> ok, makes sense
[19:21:56] <robertmaxrees> (also: it's not JSON in that case - it's just an object :) )
[19:22:28] <v0lZy> so like this
[19:22:28] <v0lZy> https://bpa.st/H7UZ4
[19:22:42] <robertmaxrees> something like that, yeah.
[19:23:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably wrap that all in an iife just to be safe.
[19:23:25] <v0lZy> iife?
[19:24:10] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/MWVKS
[19:24:25] <robertmaxrees> that (function() { /* your code here */ }()); part.
[19:25:01] <robertmaxrees> makes sure you avoid polluting the global scope.
[19:29:25] <v0lZy> OK
[19:29:31] <v0lZy> must be missing something else cause this aint worknig
[19:29:49] <v0lZy> or rather, this part is probably correct, and its osmething else im missing
[19:31:02] <robertmaxrees> was it working with the file?
[19:33:03] <robertmaxrees> v0lZy
[19:33:33] <v0lZy> not sure
[19:33:37] <v0lZy> I mean, I think what we did is ok
[19:33:40] <v0lZy> its something else thats not
[19:33:49] <v0lZy> its not giving me what i expect, im probably integrating it wrong
[19:34:12] <robertmaxrees> can share out the page and i can take a look
[19:34:21] <robertmaxrees> even better, make a jsfiddle
[19:37:12] <v0lZy> lemme try
[19:38:03] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't want the .load call.
[19:38:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c317xubp/
[19:39:09] <robertmaxrees> v0lZy
[19:39:18] <v0lZy> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=AGq9ytenGK
[19:39:22] <v0lZy> this is what i got so far and nada
[19:39:30] <robertmaxrees> togetherjs doesn't work for me - save it instead :)
[19:40:32] <robertmaxrees> v0lZy
[19:41:01] <v0lZy> ok, lemme try that.. not a fiddler
[19:41:20] <robertmaxrees> there's a "save" button at the top near "run"
[19:41:24] <robertmaxrees> next to "collaborate"
[19:41:50] <v0lZy> https://jsfiddle.net/72tj1ncf/1/
[19:42:18] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to load scripts via data URIs??
[19:42:25] <v0lZy> its basically just an html file embedding jquery and this particles.js
[19:42:40] <robertmaxrees> that's a data-ui, you're not "embedding" anything :)
[19:42:55] <v0lZy> erm... maybe im using the wrong expression
[19:43:04] <v0lZy> what I want is to have all resources in a single .html file
[19:43:09] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, i said a minute ago it doesn't want the .load() method.  particlesJS('particles-js', particlesConf);
[19:43:13] <robertmaxrees> why??
[19:43:39] <v0lZy> its a sort of document
[19:43:56] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really explain why you can't reference them from a CDN.
[19:44:02] <v0lZy> offline
[19:44:13] <robertmaxrees> like in a kiosk?
[19:44:30] <v0lZy> No, it goes into a database
[19:44:38] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[19:44:45] <v0lZy> and needs to be later retrieved and viewed offline
[19:45:06] <robertmaxrees> that's strange but alright.
[19:45:14] <robertmaxrees> so you're missing a few things here.
[19:45:24] <robertmaxrees> go look at the fiddle i shared out a bit ago for the basics.
[19:45:39] <v0lZy> ah
[19:45:39] <v0lZy> yes
[19:45:41] <v0lZy> the css stuff
[19:45:47] <robertmaxrees> not just that.
[19:45:54] <robertmaxrees> you're missing the element in the page to target.
[19:46:04] <robertmaxrees> need ot have <div id="partciles-js"></div>
[19:46:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it doesn't have a place to go.
[19:48:00] <v0lZy> yeah, that one i have
[19:48:07] <v0lZy> i added the css stuff and now works
[19:48:14] <robertmaxrees> cool
[19:48:38] <v0lZy> but i gues si need a css from that file not just a particles config..
[19:49:00] <robertmaxrees> their docs would tell you what you need to know.
[19:50:21] <v0lZy> i mean, theres this configurator on the page
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> which page?
[19:50:34] <v0lZy> thats supposed to spit out the enitre ocnfiguration in json... like color, number of particles etc
[19:50:44] <v0lZy> https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/#default
[19:50:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not everything you'd need though.
[19:50:52] <v0lZy> thats where i adjusted my stuff and what im seeing is a bit different
[19:50:54] <robertmaxrees> that's just a configuration.
[19:50:59] <v0lZy> yes
[19:51:07] <v0lZy> but i was expecting the configuration to handle colors and all
[19:51:22] <robertmaxrees> it may handle some of that.
[19:51:32] <v0lZy> and im using my config, and the css you pasted... and ... im gettin gtoo many particles and different oclor etc
[19:51:34] <robertmaxrees> but the codepen shows other stuff you need to bring in.
[19:52:35] <v0lZy> i dont need the stats
[19:52:41] <v0lZy> just the overall canvas
[19:53:36] <robertmaxrees> sure.  so leave the bit for stats out.
[19:54:51] <v0lZy> but yeah, looking at the conf, its missing colros etc
[19:55:23] <robertmaxrees> it may be using defaults.
[19:55:38] <v0lZy> ah
[19:55:42] <v0lZy> but i can put it into codepen
[19:55:46] <v0lZy> and i get everything
[19:55:47] <v0lZy> excellent
[19:55:59] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out what options you have?
[19:57:20] <v0lZy> the link i pated earlier.. on the right side, you can configure all the otpions
[19:57:25] <robertmaxrees> i saw that./
[19:57:30] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[19:57:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out what all the available options are?
[19:58:15] <robertmaxrees> because https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/ has the full list.
[19:59:35] <v0lZy> let me show you
[19:59:44] <v0lZy> no, im clear on the options
[19:59:51] <robertmaxrees> alright, then cool :)
[20:00:31] <v0lZy> https://jsfiddle.net/k1curvnL/
[20:00:58] <robertmaxrees> not sure if you're asking for help or something :)
[20:01:56] <robertmaxrees> also: if this is meant to run on a system disconnected from the internet net you'll want to fix that doctype and opening html tag.
[20:02:41] <robertmaxrees> to just <!DOCTYPE html> and <html>
[20:06:59] <v0lZy> No, just showing you what i got
[20:07:15] <v0lZy> Thanks, ill fix that too
[20:07:22] <v0lZy> Thank you very much for your help robert
[20:07:36] <robertmaxrees> cool.  are you planning on doing any other js?  if you're not gonna use jquery, might be worth just ditching it :)
[20:09:27] <v0lZy> I have some stuff in jquery that expands/collapses some divs
[20:09:35] <v0lZy> a 'read more' kind of thing
[20:09:59] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  also fwiw it's not "in" jquery, it's just "using" jquery :)
[20:15:41] <v0lZy> i wante dto imply 'written'
[20:15:47] <v0lZy> but yeha, i get what you mean
[20:16:03] <robertmaxrees> it's not a language is my point :)
