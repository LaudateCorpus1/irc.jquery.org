[00:49:39] <arup_r> Why am I getting `0` from this code ? "asset-search form-control ui-autocomplete-input".indexOf("asset-search");
[00:49:54] <arup_r> it should return non zero integer
[00:50:57] <arup_r> o i got it
[00:50:58] <arup_r> :(
[00:51:13] <arup_r> nvm. I figured it out again
[01:54:36] <zebrastik> hi there, do you have any idea why this page becomes messy at screen size < 768px --- there's the link: http://altayaydemir.com/works/n4now/
[03:17:46] <veek> what's the diff between html() and text() ?
[03:18:02] <veek> besides the fact that text can't insert html code
[03:21:23] <mooncup> veek: that is the diffrence
[03:21:39] <mooncup> you can use text for untrusted input as it can't render html
[03:24:00] <veek> thanks mooncup

[03:30:39] <naftilos76> Hi, i am using the .on method to detect ajax:success events and close a html window with .remove() . On one particular occassion the ajax:success does not work but the ajax:complete does and the weird thing is that the response is on all cases 200. Please see my gist:

[03:38:36] <huleo> http://jsfiddle.net/ybtc0pjv/
[03:38:54] <huleo> I'm wondering how to get index of an element, but only taking into account given type / selector
[03:39:01] <huleo> in this case - "which ul is it"
[03:39:09] <huleo> or perhaps - reverse :nth-of-type()
[03:39:15] <huleo> (reading, instead of selecting)
[03:48:29] <no_gravity> Does jquery have functionality to read the hasbang thingy?
[03:48:57] <no_gravity> like get b=234 from #a=123&b=234?

[04:40:43] <omardotjs> Hello
[04:48:38] <Mayzie> Hi there. I have an element with class, ".A", and a click event handler, like "$('.A').click(function () ...". However, when I remove that class from the element and add another, .A.click() is still getting called. Why?
[04:51:45] <Woet> because its bound to the element
[04:51:57] <Woet> the selector is only used to find the element and bind the callback to it
[04:52:16] <Woet> it doesnt travel along if you move the id or class
[04:53:06] <Mayzie> That's not what I wanted to hear :-/
[04:53:32] <Woet> whats your use case?
[04:54:51] <Mayzie> Just trying to deal with old/legacy code where I need to use one button which changes purpose given some criteria instead of having two buttons.
[04:55:18] <Woet> just rebind the function?
[04:55:26] <Woet> or use a variable in JS to change the purpose?
[04:55:52] <Mayzie> Yeah, I think I'll have to resort to that. Just that these two onClick functions are massive and do very different things.
[04:55:53] <Woet> $('.A').click(function(){ [..] if(state == 1){ [..] } else if(state == 2){ [..] } }
[04:55:56] <Woet> okay
[04:55:58] <Mayzie> Yeah
[04:55:59] <Woet> then put them in functions
[04:56:10] <Woet> if(state == 1) { massiveFunction(); } etc.
[06:51:54] <taplar_> dumb question, what's the function that will execute a callback after mutliple deferreds finish?
[06:53:00] <taplar_> ah, $.when, nvm
[07:32:17] <javascript797> I would very much like some help with my code. I am not a web dev, just an artist that wants to get some very simple code working
[07:33:30] <javascript797> What I'm trying to do is just get an image to replace with a gif on mouse hover over, Here is my code http://pastebin.com/tMVSr1Ss .

[07:36:36] <Kartagis> first of all, you can't have two of the same IDs on the same page
[07:52:15] <nirakara> hi can anyone help me as to why im not registering a click event here: http://jsfiddle.net/pgepotqn/
[08:25:17] <taplar_> nirakara: postContainer is an id
[08:26:55] <taplar_> javascript797: hope that answered your questions
[08:27:32] <javascript797> taplar_ was that you in jsfiddle
[08:27:33] <javascript797> ?
[08:27:37] <taplar_> yup
[08:30:04] <javascript797> Not sure how I can thank you enough!!

[08:30:37] <taplar_> ty, take care
[09:48:19] <tash> I'm trying to to write the returned data in a textarea, like $('#note').html(data) but the textarea gets all of the HTML markup from "data".  Like, <b> etc.  Is there a way that the data can show up in the textarea marked up, but without showing the actual mark up?
[09:50:35] <shoky> tash: $('#note').val( $('<div>').html(data).text() )   could work, if you want just the text
[09:53:07] <tash> k, I'll try that
[09:54:41] <tash> shoky: it did put the text in there, but I'd like for the things that I marked up to actually be marked up.  Is that possible?
[09:55:03] <shoky> what do you mean by you want them to be marked up ?
[09:55:12] <shoky> textareas can contain only plain text
[09:55:15] <tash> for example <b>test</b> <br><br> <b>blah</b>
[09:55:19] <shoky> huh
[09:55:23] <tash> oh, sorry, guess I didn't realize that
[09:55:25] <shoky> isn't that what you said you don't want?
[09:56:25] <tash> no, I'm saying that is what data is returning, if I .html that into a div or something, It shows up with the bold letters and stuff. I wanted that to be the case in the textarea. I'm a newb and didn't know that it wouldn't work in a textarea. I think you just answered my question "textareas can contain only plain text"
[09:56:46] <shoky> ah k
[09:57:39] <tash> if possible, I'd like to do something like that. I want my returned data to be in a scrollable window, like a textarea would
[09:57:57] <tash> with the bold letters and whatever other html I put in there
[09:57:58] <shoky> a div can be scrollable too, with the right css
[09:58:16] <tash> oh, see ... newb ... can you point me to a reference or something so I can try?
[09:59:40] <rocky> what's everyone's favourite hash parsing jquery plugin ?
[10:00:19] <shoky> tash: you can set the div's width/height and set its overflow to auto or visible and it should get scrollbars if the content is larger than the div
[10:00:51] <shoky> tash: er,  auto or scroll,  i meant. not visible
[10:01:16] <shoky> tash: http://jsfiddle.net/0a4fwjte/
[10:05:26] <globa> simple addClass/on('click') problem, please help. http://jsbin.com/ximezugupo/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:07:06] <shoky> globa: what's the problem?
[10:07:50] <globa> shoky: when i click the button the animation doesn't work, i lines 5-7 arent there it works...
[10:08:38] <shoky> globa: it animates for me when i click
[10:09:37] <globa> shoky: sorry it didnt save everything, please look here: http://jsbin.com/mufadeduwe/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:10:52] <shoky> globa:  http://jsbin.com/qogoludadu/1/edit?css,js,output
[10:12:18] <globa> shoky: why does that work? button is "propagating"?
[10:12:48] <shoky> globa:  events bubble up to their parents , and trigger on the parents too
[10:12:59] <shoky> globa:  stopPropagation() causes it to stop bubbling up to the parent
[10:13:30] <globa> shoky: document is the parent?
[10:14:20] <shoky> globa: it's the root parent.  i changed it from 'body' to document because by default <body> doesnt take up the full height of the document
[10:14:42] <shoky> globa: events bubble up to parent, then to parent's parent, and so on, until they reach the root
[10:15:43] <globa> shoky: so what event is even bubbling up? why does that effect my ability to remove a class?
[10:16:41] <shoky> globa: button is clicked, the click event is triggered on the button, that adds the class.  then the event automatically bubbles up to <body> and triggers the 2nd click handler, which removes the class.   so class gets added and removed right away
[10:18:17] <globa> shoky: why does that happen? Im specifying that only if button is clicked do this, why would it go and bubble out to everything else?
[10:18:52] <shoky> globa: that's how DOM events work.  the button is part of <body>.  so it makes sense that clicking the button will also trigger a click handler on <body>
[10:19:01] <shoky> because if you click the button, then you've clicked inside <body>
[10:20:07] <globa> shoky: so if my original .on click was on the body, it wouldnt bubble to the button?
[10:20:39] <shoky> globa:  no, events only bubble from child to parent, not the other way.  at least usually ;p
[10:21:06] <globa> shoky: ok that makes sense, thanks a lot for the help
[10:21:14] <shoky> np
[11:55:54] <nirakara> how to check if an event is firing and you registered a listener correctly?
[11:56:05] <nirakara> is there a way to look at all custom events which are firing
[12:09:07] <taplar_> put a console log in it.  you can console log the length of your selector to see if your matching elements
[12:09:37] <taplar_> if this is about your earlier question, i responded that you were trying to bind on a class, but your element had an id
[12:12:32] <taplar_> man, i keep missing that one until minutes later
[15:58:27] <fas3r> Hello
[15:59:05] <fas3r> is it possible to have a null argument in a function like function test( arg === null )... something like this.
[16:01:00] <DeltaHeavy> Yup, just like that
[20:01:48] <doctorly> Hi, I am having an issue populating a select2 input. I am using the code `$("#form_edit #thing_name").val("Red").trigger("change");` But it isn't actually doing anything, do I need to add the option "Red" before that code will work? I am having a hard time finding documentation for the latest version of select2 as well.
[23:19:51] <copyjosh> given this JSON, http://pastebin.com/HsWAUGPj, would I access say "description", with query.results.channel[0].description ?
[23:48:50] <guessx> http://jsfiddle.net/k60Lc29m/ - i have things that get created dynamically, problem is sometimes script loads multiple times so the function is created x amount of times
[23:49:18] <guessx> how do i make the function only run once reguardless of multiple instances
[23:58:03] <guessx> nevermind sorted it
