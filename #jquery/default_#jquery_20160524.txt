[06:04:58] <skywater> hi anyone know if i can get this PHP inside this append? http://jsbin.com/ciyoyateju/2/edit?html,js,output

[06:19:56] <skywater> ??
[06:25:07] <MrStein> I just noticed that while .attr('onblur', 'alert("test");')  works, .attr('onclick', 'alert("test");') does not. The correct syntax is .attr('onClick',
[06:25:15] <MrStein> why the inconsistency?
[06:25:34] <Duikb00t> oh oh oh
[06:26:12] <MrStein> according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4380719/onclick-or-onclick the correct one is onclick , allthough that question is not about jQuery but general HTML/JS
[06:26:39] <ademzenuni> hello

[06:26:53] <MrStein> Or in other words: where can I look up the correct attr names?
[06:26:56] <ademzenuni> my value is showing outside the knob instead of insideeee
[06:27:08] <ademzenuni> does anyone know why ?
[06:33:03] <skywater> is this statement possible in jquery ?  $('.productTable').find('#' + this.name + 'tr').each(function (i, el) {
[06:34:44] <AdamPDotty> not complete but valid, yes
[06:35:16] <skywater> doesnt work :(
[06:35:44] <skywater> i got <tr id=¨1¨> <td>a</td></tr> <tr id=¨2¨> <td>b</td> etc.

[07:18:54] <cannap> you can remove tr if you want
[07:18:58] <cannap> because id are unique
[07:19:30] <skywater> thats true :)
[07:19:33] <Cork> (and you should cause using tag name selection with an id makes it slower)

[08:56:24] <DreamStiffler> Hi guys
[08:57:01] <taplar> yo
[08:57:35] <DreamStiffler> Im a newb. Hi taplar my savior. Im trying to use dropzonejs.
[08:58:20] <DreamStiffler> I tried putting a function on document ready for an elemnt from a drop but it didnt work
[08:58:40] <DreamStiffler> So im wondering where should i put it
[08:59:11] <DreamStiffler> I tried under init and also success but only some worked
[08:59:43] <taplar> got a fiddle? i'm not familiar with that plugin
[08:59:51] <DreamStiffler> Pls excuse my terms
[09:00:57] <tata> i learnt jquery
[09:01:08] <tata> what should I learn next
[09:01:25] <hellyeah> jquery ui may be
[09:01:25] <taplar> what do you know/want to do?
[09:01:35] <DreamStiffler> Taplar as usual no. And on phone now. I just want to get an idea how it should work. The dropzone i use is for drag and drop. Drag image , text field etc.
[09:02:31] <taplar> DreamStiffler: i'd need to see what your trying if i was to attempt to sift through that plugin api and figure something out
[09:03:20] <DreamStiffler> Ok yeah who am i kidding. Ill have to reach home first. Still in train. Will see if you guys still around
[09:05:28] <tata> are ppl here code php?
[09:06:20] <taplar> try #php
[09:06:27] <taplar> ##php
[09:06:34] <jerit> php? Nah I use proper programming languages
[09:06:56] <taplar> tell that to facebook
[09:07:04] <DreamStiffler> But just roughly talking - again just to get an idea...how do i delete a div/image/etc that has been dragged in. I tried using $(this)..find(..) and put the function in document ready. But it wasnt responding. But if i try to put it with the draggables (dropzone) some will work. Some wouldnt. Such as if i use .hide itll hide all.
[09:07:38] <DreamStiffler> Ok nvm its just a desp attempt to stab in thedark
[09:08:06] <taplar> in a doc ready nothing is dragged in
[09:08:21] <taplar> inside an event for that plugin, maybe at that point something is dragged in
[09:08:25] <taplar> but not on page load
[09:08:28] <jerit> facebook is a hot mess of UX problems
[09:08:35] <taplar> ux isn't php
[09:08:41] <taplar> you just don't like things, :P
[09:11:40] <tata> i am wondering what fun I can do with jquery
[09:12:07] <taplar> that's why i asked what you want to do.  think of a side project to play with and role with it
[09:12:37] <taplar> or if you are a big fan of something, make a fan site and be creative
[09:12:57] <tata> yes creative I want to go
[09:13:11] <tata> there is no specific purpose
[09:13:22] <taplar> the doing is the purpose
[09:13:51] <taplar> you'll often find you learn more from doing those things, cause you run into issues, logic problems, you otherwise wouldn't think of
[09:15:43] <taplar> and if it is a fan site, then you having your own little corner of the web is also a purpose, :)

[09:22:39] <taplar> where are your other params?
[09:28:20] <cr0mulent> Hello, I am trying to add “overflow-x : hidden” to an html element using jquery. I need to add this to “ui-widget-content” but I don’t think I’m targeting it correctly. Could someone look at line 22 of this pastebin? http://pastebin.com/iff9pSP0
[09:30:33] <Duikb00t> o/ taplar
[09:31:28] <taplar> cr0mulent: https://jsfiddle.net/ywmc5gp5/ seems to work
[09:31:44] <taplar> sup Duikb00t
[09:32:04] <Duikb00t> things got changed!
[09:32:19] <taplar> cr0mulent: kinda strange though that your putting an overflow hidden on an input field though...
[09:32:24] <taplar> Duikb00t: sweet
[09:34:01] <cr0mulent> taplar: there is a horizontal scrollbar in my dropdown menu, adding overflow-x to ui-widget-content fixes the problem in the web inspector. Now I’m trying to find a way to inject it into an existing codebase.
[09:34:31] <cr0mulent> .css(“overflow-x”,”hidden”) is not working unfortunately.
[09:34:45] <taplar> but that snipplet wasn't a dropdown.  it's an input...
[09:35:13] <taplar> you talking about a jq ui dropdown?
[09:37:32] <ferr> It's in the function (table) is my other params
[09:38:31] <taplar> ferr: so create an object with all the key value pairs you want and give that to your ajax
[09:43:26] <cr0mulent> taplar: yes jquery ui dropdown
[09:43:48] <cr0mulent> taplar: it’s an auto complete box with a dropdown
[09:44:09] <taplar> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ ?
[09:45:19] <cr0mulent> taplar: yes, I’ll take a look at that some more.
[09:46:47] <taplar> i'm not getting a scrollbar: https://jsfiddle.net/0bu3rr92/
[09:46:50] <shoky> why add css via js anyway?  just use css if you must. but would be better to figure out what's causing the overflow and get rid of it
[09:46:55] <shoky> cr0mulent ^
[09:47:28] <Duikb00t> taplar:  my internet is dying
[09:47:58] <taplar> D:
[09:48:24] <taplar> you mean your phone is dying?
[09:48:56] <Duikb00t> No it got request timeouts  whole the tim e
[09:49:05] <andromedian> $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $(this).find('p').offset().top - _sticky.outerHeight()}, 500);  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined ?
[09:49:07] <Duikb00t> You still remember what I was working on yesterday?
[09:49:24] <taplar> yah, the mobile/desktop menu stuff?
[09:50:08] <taplar> andromedian: console log the $(this).find('p')
[09:50:18] <Duikb00t> yes
[09:50:18] <Duikb00t> It got simplified
[09:51:06] <taplar> yay.....?
[09:51:29] <Duikb00t> you still have the url maybe?
[09:51:34] <Duikb00t> im almost finished :D
[09:52:22] <ferr> taplar: u have any ideas?
[09:52:26] <taplar> no i closed it yesterday after i got busy with local stuff
[09:52:57] <taplar> ferr: i recommended building the object and give it to the ajax
[09:53:46] <taplar> i'm not sure what your having issues with with creating that object as your snipplet isn't using the 'table' variable any where in that regards
[10:19:35] <carl-eric> hi - which of the many dropdown/<select> plugins is considered mature and usable? i have a <select> with many options and want them searchable like a combobox.
[10:23:03] <m1su> carl-eric select2 is pretty nice

[10:45:35] <carl-eric> m1su, thank you, we'll have a look
[10:46:40] <danemacmillan> Anyone here know when the official release of 3.0 will happen?

[10:46:56] <Uhkis> i prefer chosen http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[10:47:06] <DeltaHeavy> I'm including jQuery in an iframe but it's somehow overwriting the parent instance of jQuery. Anybody know how to go about troubleshooting this?
[10:47:18] <DeltaHeavy> Doing this right now instead: var jQuery = window.parent.jQuery;
[10:48:01] <Uhkis> DeltaHeavy: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[10:49:41] <DeltaHeavy> Uhkis But why is it overwriting the parent version of jQuery in the first place? That seems kind of insane.
[10:50:00] <DeltaHeavy> I know about noconflict but like, where would I apply it in a way that's not going to mess up existing code?
[10:50:09] <DeltaHeavy> In the iframe? Outside of it?
[10:52:40] <Uhkis> right after the second load of jquery probably
[10:53:11] <DeltaHeavy> Uhkis But the iframe is sandboxed right? It can only go in to out but why would jQuery be doing this on its own?
[10:56:43] <Uhkis> i dont think it's sandboxed at all in the same domain
[10:57:38] <viewty> Hi all - I've got https://jsfiddle.net/jhmx86nk/1/ - this works on my page fine, it adds the dttable as expected, but then the table isn't changed to a datatable. No errors, just no result. Any thoughts?
[10:57:59] <Uhkis> DeltaHeavy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox
[10:58:32] <viewty> ok nevermind, ignore that, Im stupid. 'dttable' isn't the same as '#dttable' :o
[11:03:13] <DeltaHeavy> Uhkis Perfect, thanks!
[11:32:07] <simonsaysdiaf> hello. im trying to create a modal window and i have this line to center the container var winW = $(window).width(); $(id).css('left', winW/2-$(id).width()/2);
[11:32:19] <simonsaysdiaf> however, $(window).width is returning undefined
[11:37:29] <decx> you dont need javascript to center something
[11:41:20] <simonsaysdiaf> well i do
[11:41:27] <simonsaysdiaf> because i want to measure the width of the window
[11:41:39] <simonsaysdiaf> and then set the left css rule to half that
[11:41:46] <simonsaysdiaf> since it's a responsive design
[11:42:07] <BillCriswell> simonsaysdiaf: What browser support do you need?
[11:42:21] <simonsaysdiaf> chrome, firefox, ie10+
[11:42:25] <simonsaysdiaf> safari
[11:42:30] <BillCriswell> Are you using autoprefixer?
[11:42:36] <simonsaysdiaf> no
[11:42:40] <simonsaysdiaf> im using requirejs
[11:42:53] <BillCriswell> Cause it could be as simple as `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;` on the parent.
[11:43:15] <simonsaysdiaf> it's absolutely positioned
[11:43:24] <simonsaysdiaf> and i don't want it to be a flex display
[11:43:40] <simonsaysdiaf> really, i would like to get the window.width :)
[11:45:51] <BillCriswell> simonsaysdiaf: Are you sure $ is jQuery?
[11:45:54] <simonsaysdiaf> yes
[11:46:04] <simonsaysdiaf> requirejs(["jquery"], function($)
[11:46:05] <BillCriswell> also, leaving this here for future reference: https://jsfiddle.net/zu65xcso/
[11:46:08] <robertmaxrees> gooood morning.
[11:46:29] <simonsaysdiaf> yea if it wasn't absolutely positioned on top of a fixed position, then that might be a good solution
[11:46:41] <simonsaysdiaf> but you can't use text-align:center; or an absolute container
[11:46:54] <simonsaysdiaf> well, you CAN
[11:46:58] <simonsaysdiaf> but it doesn't do what i want
[11:47:35] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:47:52] <simonsaysdiaf> ty though :)
[11:47:53] <BillCriswell> Are you overwriting window somehow accidentally? Works here: https://jsfiddle.net/zu65xcso/1/
[11:48:15] <simonsaysdiaf> hm it seems like somethign else is going on... i need to investigate further
[11:49:13] <simonsaysdiaf> thank you for your help. it looks liek the width itself isnt undefined, just somthign else
[11:50:09] <simonsaysdiaf> if anyone is still following]
[11:50:20] <simonsaysdiaf> it seems like $(window).width() is being assigned correctly
[11:50:27] <simonsaysdiaf> but foir some reaosn
[11:50:29] <simonsaysdiaf> $(id).css('left', winW/2-$(id).width()/2);
[11:50:32] <simonsaysdiaf> this is set to 0px
[11:50:46] <decx> still doesnt make sense
[11:50:52] <decx> centering with js
[11:51:06] <simonsaysdiaf> decx: okay how would you do it
[11:51:06] <decx> width/2 and height/2 isnt even center
[11:51:14] <decx> position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
[11:51:16] <decx> it is known
[11:51:28] <robertmaxrees> http://howtocenterincss.com/
[11:51:36] <simonsaysdiaf> width/2 and height/2 is center, actually. i have it working on another site
[11:51:57] <decx> it's a point
[11:52:05] <decx> i doubt your modal is 1x1 px
[11:52:48] <simonsaysdiaf> i'd send you a link, but it would violate the agreement i signed
[11:53:02] <robertmaxrees> is there a fiddle kicking around?
[11:53:25] <simonsaysdiaf> not as of right now, if this still isn't working then i'll make one
[11:54:08] <simonsaysdiaf> that said, i'll try your way decx i like that better
[11:54:25] <robertmaxrees> if their version doesn't work (and it really should), check out that site i linked.
[11:54:33] <simonsaysdiaf> thanks
[12:02:55] <KnightsOfNi> Hi, I have a div with 4 <a> tags inside, I just want to select the first one, like so: $resultHeader = $searchResults.find('.results a:first-child')
[12:03:13] <KnightsOfNi> but it's not working, it doesn't recognize it when I attach a click handler on it
[12:03:23] <KnightsOfNi> is this the proper way to do it?
[12:07:42] <simonsaysdiaf> ehh im not an expert but you might try .children() with .first()
[12:07:45] <simonsaysdiaf> resultHeader = $search
[12:07:47] <simonsaysdiaf> oops
[12:07:53] <simonsaysdiaf> https://api.jquery.com/first/
[12:08:07] <simonsaysdiaf> https://api.jquery.com/children/
[12:08:10] <simonsaysdiaf> KnightsOfNi: ^
[12:08:12] <simonsaysdiaf> btw love ur nick
[12:08:13] <simonsaysdiaf> :)
[12:08:22] <KnightsOfNi> I put a direct selector now, and it still doesn't work
[12:08:29] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[12:08:38] <robertmaxrees> yer markup i mean
[12:08:49] <KnightsOfNi> $('.temp').on('click' - but it's inside content that is loaded after the dom is loaded
[12:08:51] <KnightsOfNi> with ajax
[12:08:59] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener.
[12:09:26] <KnightsOfNi> isn't .on( already delegated ?
[12:09:29] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:09:35] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:09:45] <robertmaxrees> the second example is relevant :)
[12:09:51] <robertmaxrees> $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() {
[12:10:11] <KnightsOfNi> I don't see what is different about that :)
[12:10:20] <robertmaxrees> the second argument ot the method.
[12:10:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't bind to the element directly, you bind to the parent and then pass the child selector.
[12:10:36] <KnightsOfNi> oh with that syntax it's always delegated?
[12:10:42] <KnightsOfNi> ok got it
[12:10:46] <robertmaxrees> that's a delegated listener, yes.
[12:11:45] <KnightsOfNi> so like this? $searchResults.on('click', 'a:first' function() {
[12:11:58] <robertmaxrees> are the search results dynamically created?
[12:12:07] <KnightsOfNi> yeah
[12:12:09] <robertmaxrees> then no.
[12:12:33] <robertmaxrees> if you read the docs i linked, you'll see that you need to bind to a parent that exists at the time of binding - that's often on pageload.
[12:12:38] <KnightsOfNi> but the container $searchResults already exists
[12:12:45] <robertmaxrees> that's what i was asking about.
[12:12:47] <robertmaxrees> so then use that.
[12:12:52] <KnightsOfNi> ok let me try
[12:12:53] <robertmaxrees> that theoretically should work.
[12:15:09] <KnightsOfNi> Yip, it does
[12:15:12] <KnightsOfNi> thanks
[12:15:14] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[12:19:34] <sp1rs> How to disable past dates in jquery datepicker ?
[12:19:45] <sp1rs> i used mindate=0, but it didnt work
[12:20:30] <robertmaxrees> did you use the javascript initializer?

[12:26:14] <robertmaxrees> .prop()
[12:26:21] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 you want .prop() when editing elements.
[12:27:06] <Glaisher> What about when I want to check whether an element is disabled? (return value)
[12:27:11] <robertmaxrees> .prop()
[12:27:19] <robertmaxrees> .prop() will get you the current state of that element.
[12:27:50] <Glaisher> Thanks
[12:28:51] <Glaisher> Also, when would I usually want to use .attr() instead of .prop()? I have trouble with choosing which to use a lot of times.
[12:29:11] <robertmaxrees> when you want the initial value of an attribute.
[12:29:21] <robertmaxrees> so like 99% of the time, you want prop.
[12:29:57] <Glaisher> OK, thanks again
[12:32:05] * taplar_busy beat boxes
[13:01:57] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> hey guys I have this: http://pastebin.com/Yw8WM3g9 which resets my form after submitting, but if I refill the form and try to resubmit it submits a blank value
[13:02:18] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> if I remove the val('') it just resubmits the last value that was entered
[13:05:21] <jerit> UnfixedSNIPERJ so what do you want it to submit?
[13:05:51] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> the new value that is typed into the submit form
[13:06:02] <jerit> I you submit with .val() it'll submit with the current value for the textbox. If you submit with .val('') it'll su
[13:06:05] <jerit> ugh ignore that
[13:06:11] <jerit> so just submit with .val()
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> do you have more than one #realtime-create on the page?
[13:06:59] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> no
[13:07:18] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> it works the first time, but not if i submit the form again
[13:07:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[13:07:29] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> just resubmits whatever was last input into the box
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> can to make a fiddle?>
[13:07:35] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> sure
[13:11:42] <RedShift> any typescript users here? I'm getting error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ [key: string]: any; }'. when I use on()
[13:11:52] <RedShift> screenshot: http://oi64.tinypic.com/2rfpldk.jpg
[13:12:34] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/UnfixedSNIPERJ/swdnsmjL/
[13:12:50] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> there is the basic form
[13:13:19] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i dont know how to make it actually pretend to submit and reset in jsfiddle
[13:13:46] <robertmaxrees> there's a section on the left for AJAX info.  let me poke.
[13:13:57] <robertmaxrees> RedShift did you include typings for jquery?
[13:15:00] <RedShift> yes I included the typings, otherwise a whole lot of other things wouldn't work ;-)
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> just makin' sure, yo.  we get people that don't do basic things like that all the time.
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/swdnsmjL/2/ not seeing that issue happen.
[13:16:58] <robertmaxrees> are you looking in your network tab?
[13:17:12] <robertmaxrees> like, where are you seeing the same data get sent over?
[13:17:30] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i log the response from the server in console.log
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> RedShift https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/7827
[13:17:55] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> if I put "test" in the input box, click submit, it will properly submit test
[13:18:15] <RedShift> robertmaxrees found that bug too, but it's not the same issue
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> RedShift 'kay.  not sure then :)
[13:18:25] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> but if I try it again after the first attempt and but, "test2" it will submit "test" like the first time
[13:18:43] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> put*
[13:18:47] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ so your network tab says "test2" was sent, or that's what you're seeing come back from your server?
[13:19:14] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> "test" comes back from the server
[13:19:19] <RedShift> found it, I need to use JQueryMouseEventObject instead of MouseEvent in the function signature
[13:19:29] <robertmaxrees> RedShift iiinterest.  good to know.
[13:19:41] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ what does your network tab say was submitted?
[13:20:29] <RedShift> didn't find it myself, got it from #typescript
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> still good info :)
[13:21:02] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> says test :/
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ try doing $('[id=dirname]').length
[13:22:19] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:22:34] <robertmaxrees> or whatever ID you're using to get data out of.
[13:23:46] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> 1 the first time and 2 on any request after that
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> you're getting the value of the first one.
[13:24:11] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I know
[13:24:18] <robertmaxrees> alright :)
[13:24:21] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> but how do I get the value of the second request
[13:24:36] <robertmaxrees> why not kill off the first form instead?
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> or replace it?
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat an ID on the same page.
[13:25:26] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> how do I replace the form?
[13:25:33] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> thats what I am trying to figure out lol
[13:25:47] <robertmaxrees> it depends - how are you adding the new stuff?
[13:25:55] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> like I submit the form, how do I replace it with the same exact form or clear it so it can be reused without refreshing the page
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're using .append() somewhere.
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> so take that part out.
[13:26:19] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> no append anywhere
[13:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you have code somewhere that's appending another form.
[13:26:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove that.
[13:27:08] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i have multiple forms on the page, but none of them use the same ids
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> do you have inputs using the same IDs?
[13:27:28] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> no
[13:27:38] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i just double checked to make sure of that
[13:27:42] <robertmaxrees> err...
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> you said $('[id=dirname]').length returns 2.
[13:27:51] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:28:07] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> 1 after the first submit
[13:28:11] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> 2 after any submit after that
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> right, that's your issue.
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid.
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs on a page.
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> so you have something appending elements with the same IDs onto the page.
[13:29:41] <taplar_busy> it's hard to be unique
[13:30:12] <robertmaxrees> just be younique
[13:30:24] <taplar_busy> i want that tshirt
[13:30:28] <taplar_busy> heh
[13:32:31] <taplar_busy> i'll hang it next to my tshirt with the non copyright infringing twitter bird with the phrase on the opposite side, "no one cares"
[13:32:36] <taplar_busy> ^ true shirt, lol
[13:32:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:33:50] <taplar_busy> i don't have many shirts with sayings but i have that one, and another with text going vertical up the front that says, "your head looks really funny tilted like that"
[13:33:58] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> still not finding any duplicate ids... plus i dont understand how it would work the first time but not the second if there was a duplicate id unrelated to the form itself
[13:33:59] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> :/
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ how are you looking for the duplicate IDs?
[13:35:59] <taplar_busy> does load() append or replace?
[13:36:44] <taplar_busy> guess it replaces, says it sets the html
[13:37:16] <robertmaxrees> doesn't mean #data is a parent of #realtime-create :)
[13:37:34] <robertmaxrees> imo the response should contain the data needed in this case.
[13:38:03] <robertmaxrees> UnfixedSNIPERJ $5 says $("#realtime-create") gets appended to another place in the document, which means $('#data').load("created.php?mode=random&ajax=1"); is probably adding it.
[13:39:10] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> ah shit that makes sense then
[13:39:20] <taplar_busy> made rob $5
[13:39:29] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i was using w3s validator and checking the source by hand lol
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> so that doesn't account for JS.
[13:39:54] <taplar_busy> source like view source or inspecting the page?
[13:40:01] <robertmaxrees> you want inspect element, not view source.
[13:40:06] <taplar_busy> ^
[13:40:46] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> yeah thats what i was doing, but not after the request, I have the form inside the page that load performs
[13:40:50] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> will take that out :D
[13:41:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, and just return the data instead of needing a second async call.
[13:43:55] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> im glad you caught that because that was driving me nuts lol, thanks!
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[14:24:16] <clarjon1> Hey guys, having a bit of a brain fart here. Trying to implement http://labs.voronianski.com/jquery.avgrund.js/ into a site, how do i trigger it on page load instead of it watching for a click event again?
[14:26:22] <robertmaxrees> might need to manually .click() the element in question.
[14:26:44] <clarjon1> ah, found it deep within the github closed issues section
[14:26:55] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:27:06] <clarjon1> there's an option i can set
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:32:09] <clarjon1> hm, option does not work. Let's see if i can figure out .click =()
[14:33:18] <clarjon1> ah, what i want appears to be .trigger actually
[14:33:48] <robertmaxrees> you can use .click(),t oo.
[15:07:24] <jquery858> can anyone help with this jquery deferred code? I need to hit several url, wait until they all resolve (success or fail) then do some calculation on it.
[15:07:32] <jquery858> but it seems to me, done is called before all of it are resolved
[15:07:34] <jquery858> http://jsfiddle.net/b12rsy1v/3/
[15:08:14] <jquery858> if you change line 4, to use b instead of a, it works
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> jquery858 you're hitting the wrong endpoint to simulate ajax calls in jsfiddle.
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> also, use map here, not a for loop :)
[15:13:50] <kevireilly> I'm trying to figure out how it is deferred, and perhaps I'm being dense, but isn't all the requests being made in parallel when pushing each request to the the array?
[15:14:01] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees, that was just to show a point, even if it was just any other site, it still does not work
[15:14:37] <jquery858> change line 4 to = b; and it works as i expected it to
[15:14:38] <robertmaxrees> kevireilly they can return out of order.
[15:14:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery858 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xd0rg2e9/ this works fine.
[15:15:25] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees i get i is undefined
[15:15:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xd0rg2e9/1/
[15:15:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry, forgot to change one part.
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> also, .done() will fire when the first arg of .then() fires.
[15:19:14] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/xd0rg2e9/2/
[15:19:16] <robertmaxrees> rather, if it fires.
[15:19:34] <jquery858> so its possible if the endpoint i'm reaching is non existent (it could be down)
[15:19:56] <jquery858> but in this new example, one one is down i get the "then" instead of waiting for all of it to resolve
[15:19:57] <robertmaxrees> or returns an error, like in your case. open your network tab.
[15:20:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:20:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting the rejection there.
[15:20:28] <jquery858> https://jsfiddle.net/xd0rg2e9/2/
[15:20:30] <jquery858> i get fail
[15:20:32] <jquery858> and i dont see then at all
[15:20:40] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:20:42] <robertmaxrees> because one of them failed.
[15:20:58] <jquery858> ok i need to be able to ping x # of endpoint
[15:21:04] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[15:21:05] <jquery858> and some could fail some could succeed
[15:21:07] <robertmaxrees> and are.
[15:21:11] <jquery858> and then after they all complete, i do something
[15:21:14] <robertmaxrees> then you want .always()
[15:21:49] <jquery858> https://jsfiddle.net/xd0rg2e9/3/
[15:21:51] <jquery858> i added always
[15:21:52] <robertmaxrees> the first arg to .then() is if they all resolve, the other arg is if they reject.
[15:22:01] <jquery858> but in my console, always is fired before they all return
[15:22:11] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming that?
[15:22:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xd0rg2e9/4/
[15:22:32] <robertmaxrees> is what you want btw.
[15:23:43] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees: in my console, i see 404, always, 404, 404
[15:24:15] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees: do you see 404,404,404,always ?
[15:24:22] <jquery858> (using your link)
[15:24:32] <robertmaxrees> i see them all complete before jquery fires.
[15:24:36] <robertmaxrees> you're probably using chrome.
[15:24:43] <jquery858> i AM using chrome
[15:24:50] <jquery858> is the behavior of jquery different depending on browser?
[15:24:59] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't be.  one sec.
[15:25:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/13493512
[15:25:47] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.
[15:25:54] <robertmaxrees> always gets called as soon as they all resolve or one rejects.
[15:26:07] <robertmaxrees> are you in control of the endpoint you're hitting?
[15:26:19] <jquery858> no I am not
[15:26:36] <robertmaxrees> that's a tough one then.
[15:26:39] <robertmaxrees> read that SO link.
[15:26:47] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees: thanks
[15:26:50] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[15:27:37] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees: do you have a better way to handle this besides using when?
[15:28:07] <robertmaxrees> your particular case is kind of unusual.  i might look at setting up a server to help broker that in a better way.
[15:29:25] <jquery858> I mean, isn't it normal to expect some end points could be down
[15:29:30] <jquery858> even google goes down sometimes
[15:29:42] <taplar_busy> that's what load balancers are for, ;)
[15:29:44] <jquery858> so by having code that is not dependent on all the endpoint are up is good practice
[15:29:57] <robertmaxrees> that's why you need to have a server-side system to broker that.
[15:30:08] <robertmaxrees> because in your case, an error isn't a reason for a rejection.
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> but to jquery, it is.
[15:31:07] <jquery858> so since this is user input (user selects)
[15:31:18] <jquery858> its better to have a script and check each end point to make sure they exist before doing this ?
[15:31:31] <jquery858> i cant really setup a server to handle this
[15:31:36] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[15:31:41] <robertmaxrees> you already have hosting of some kind.
[15:31:57] <jquery858> its being hosted on github pages
[15:32:09] <robertmaxrees> you could do something cheap via heroku or awk.
[15:32:10] <robertmaxrees> *aws
[15:32:16] <robertmaxrees> but fair enough.
[15:32:39] <robertmaxrees> I'd scrub the list to find ones that are "bad" and remove those.
[15:32:48] <jquery858> @robertmaxrees: thanks, thats what i was thinking as well
[15:33:14] <robertmaxrees> but i'd highly encourage a server that you can just hand URLs to that ships back everything you need at once.
[15:36:16] <robertmaxrees> til one of the services i deployed a while ago handles over 1M requests a day and handles it beautifully.
[15:44:23] <jquery858> 11.57 request per second
[15:48:09] <z1haze> hey! I have a weird issue with validator.js  .. its probably something in our code, but I need help finding it. For some reason one of the validation methods is running 2 times in a row each time it runs, causing an extra error span to be added every time it validates a field.. is there any tools in chrome that can help find where/when a method is
[15:48:09] <z1haze> being called from?
[15:48:29] <taplar_busy> how are you binding the validator?
[15:49:01] <taplar_busy> knee jerk reaction is your binding it twice
[15:51:55] <z1haze> truly, i have no freaking clue what they are doing
[15:52:07] <z1haze> team of like 20 people, with moderate knowledge at best
[15:52:09] <taplar_busy> 'they' ?
[15:52:12] <z1haze> using/reusing files over and over
[15:52:16] <taplar_busy> ah
[15:52:27] <z1haze> im an intern at a web development company for demandware applications
[15:52:37] <taplar_busy> so now it's 'we'
[15:52:39] <taplar_busy> ;)
[15:52:41] <z1haze> so im just thrown in the mix of things, but im trying to better things and do it the right way
[15:52:57] <z1haze> yep, we
[15:53:21] <taplar_busy> ok, so does the form have a class or id on it?
[15:53:34] <taplar_busy> and are you using the validatejs(sp?) plugin
[15:54:08] <taplar_busy> https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[15:54:10] <z1haze> just using the regular jquery validate
[15:54:11] <z1haze> yea
[15:54:37] <z1haze> and they(we) have some custom validation methods
[15:54:52] <taplar_busy> ok, so look for instance in the logic that are doing validate(......) on the lookup of that form
[15:54:56] <z1haze> one for this particular issue is called validateZipCode()
[15:56:00] <z1haze> just returns true/false if a regex for a zip passes
[15:56:07] <z1haze> so i dont see how that coul have an issue on that
[15:56:17] <taplar_busy> rule out first that your only binding once
[15:56:27] <z1haze> am i able to check thatin the browser
[15:56:38] <taplar_busy> better to try the source
[15:56:49] <taplar_busy> especially if you have an ide that allows searching files
[15:56:55] <z1haze> stuff scattered so many places, what would the binding syntax look like
[15:56:58] <z1haze> yea i do
[15:57:22] <taplar_busy> first shot look for ".validate("
[15:57:34] <z1haze> well, i know thers a bunch of those
[15:57:46] <z1haze> but we have this: $.validator.addMethod('zip-code', validateZipCode, Resources.INVALID_ZIPCODE);
[15:57:57] <taplar_busy> ignore that for now
[15:58:03] <z1haze> so doesnt that mean for class of .zip-code input run validateZipCode() with the rules
[15:58:07] <z1haze> ok
[15:58:13] <taplar_busy> look for the ".validate(" and then see what it'd doing those on and see if they are your form
[15:58:37] <z1haze> all 89 occurences
[15:58:58] <taplar_busy> if your unfamiliar with a code base, you have to dig, :)
[15:59:12] <z1haze> yea thats what stinks, im extremely unfamiliar
[15:59:26] <taplar_busy> no one else on the team available to give you a pointer?
[15:59:26] <z1haze> the software is demandware, so cant really learn it but on the jo
[15:59:27] <z1haze> job*
[15:59:33] <z1haze> ha
[15:59:54] <z1haze> i think im honestly more exp in general web development than they
[16:01:00] <z1haze> inside the valid: function() {... of validator there is var validator = $(this[0].form).validate();
[16:01:14] <z1haze> is it valling validate again? or is valid part the first method it runs
[16:01:18] <z1haze> valid*
[16:02:22] <taplar_busy> someone may correct me, but I *believe* that is just setting it up to validate on submit
[16:02:36] <taplar_busy> initialization
[16:02:45] <z1haze> i may have an idea whats causing it
[16:02:51] <z1haze> we are setting up a single page checkout system
[16:03:13] <z1haze> so there are like stages of the checkout but all on one page.. all triggered by clickign the same 'continue' button
[16:03:47] <z1haze> im just grasping for straws at this point
[16:03:54] <taplar_busy> i feel ya
[16:04:29] <z1haze> and its always on blur
[16:04:40] <z1haze> but i did a console log and it always runs twice every time on blur
[16:05:15] <z1haze> an idea what its doing https://gyazo.com/40d2fc312d308da1c4c4e37a9074cb37
[16:05:34] <taplar_busy> i can't debug images, :(
[16:06:20] <z1haze> i think one of the sister sites is live with the error let me see, lol
[16:06:27] <taplar_busy> like i said, rule out double binding.  if that isn't the issue then you go from there
[16:07:00] <z1haze> yep! if you dont mine looking
[16:07:13] <z1haze> https://www.katvondbeauty.com add a single item to cart, then check out. first page of checkout just try to submit the empty form
[16:07:13] <taplar_busy> i got some time.  and there are others here too
[16:07:29] <z1haze> each time you do what i did in the zip code (enter a digit, click blur)
[16:07:33] <z1haze> it adds the error again
[16:09:48] <taplar_busy> oh shit dude
[16:09:53] <taplar_busy> your more than double binding
[16:09:53] <z1haze> O.o
[16:09:55] <z1haze> lmao
[16:10:01] <z1haze> dont judge me for this
[16:10:03] <taplar_busy> i just got it to list the message three times
[16:10:09] <taplar_busy> let me see if I can figure out a pattern
[16:10:10] <z1haze> its crazy isnt it
[16:10:34] <jerit> this reminds me I should probably set up a shopping cart system on my site as well
[16:10:41] <taplar_busy> yeah
[16:10:53] <taplar_busy> every time i enter a character and tab out, an extra error message is being added
[16:10:58] <jerit> but I want to integrate EFT payment as well through magento or something
[16:11:04] <taplar_busy> you got some sort of binding on input most likely
[16:11:26] <taplar_busy> cause just focusing doesn't seem to increase it
[16:11:57] <taplar_busy> or
[16:12:06] <taplar_busy> your improperly removing old error messages
[16:12:38] <z1haze> we shouldnt have to
[16:12:45] <z1haze> the other fields dont require it
[16:12:53] <taplar_busy> just throwing out ideas
[16:12:54] <z1haze> its not supposed to keep adding them
[16:13:06] <z1haze> its double binding like you said
[16:13:12] <z1haze> so instead of adding 1 and fading it out
[16:13:14] <z1haze> its adding 2 and fading out 1
[16:13:40] <z1haze> so increments a new span each time you run validate
[16:13:40] <taplar_busy> and then if you repeat it does 3
[16:13:48] <z1haze> yea
[16:15:35] <z1haze> any leads?
[16:15:52] <taplar_busy> not from the site.  i don't know where your binding logic is
[16:16:08] <taplar_busy> or the logic for validating the 'postal-code' class
[16:20:20] <taplar_busy> i'd guess it's in your app.js
[16:20:27] <taplar_busy> which is minified so i can't tell much
[16:20:39] <taplar_busy> but I do see a validate() in there and a lookup for fields ending with '_zip'
[16:29:10] <z1haze> but nothing calling it twice
[16:32:59] <whore> Hello
[16:35:03] <whore> Can anyone help me with this query that seems to be doing nothing but checking if an account was logged in by selenium
[16:35:28] <taplar_busy> share your logic with the room and if anyone can help they'll chime in
[16:35:53] <whore> its long
[16:36:04] <taplar_busy> jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[16:36:05] <whore> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[16:36:32] <Xatenev1> Is there any safe way to check if I reached the bottom of the page?
[16:37:50] <taplar_busy> maybe some comparison of scroll height to scroll top
[16:38:33] <taplar_busy> i know in the past when i was doing some infinite scrolling for a guestbook i'd throw an invisible div at the bottom and when it became visible i knew it was at the bottom
[16:38:53] <taplar_busy> but that was just me not knowing much about jq
[16:39:17] <whore> Nobody knows what http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.jsdoes?
[16:39:27] <taplar_busy> that's the jquery library
[16:40:12] <whore> oh
[16:40:13] <whore> oh
[16:40:15] <whore> I see
[16:40:27] <whore> but it is like sort of "compiled"
[16:40:39] <taplar_busy> minified and uglyfied
[16:40:41] <whore> all whitespace gona
[16:40:42] <whore> gone
[16:40:51] <taplar_busy> yep, whitespace is not needed for the compiler
[16:40:56] <taplar_busy> it just takes up bandwidth
[16:41:22] <taplar_busy> when you talk about high traffic sites or mobile devices, bandwidth matters
[16:42:01] <taplar_busy> if you take off the '.min' part you'll see the unminified version
[16:54:14] <z1haze> will $('.form-row.postal-code').find('span.error').remove(); remove all span.errors it finds in form-row.postal, or just the first one it finds
[16:54:21] <robertmaxrees> all of them.
[16:57:52] <z1haze> will it throw an error if you try to delete an element that isnt there or just do nothing?
[16:57:54] <z1haze> using remove()
[16:58:44] <robertmaxrees> .remove(), like most jquery DOM manipulation methods, checks to see if the element exists first.
[16:58:47] <robertmaxrees> jquery avoids throwing errors.
[16:58:59] <taplar_busy> can't find something that doesn't exist either
[16:59:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:59:26] <z1haze> i like
[17:05:55] <DeltaHeavy> If I'm expecting to run .remove() on an element I'd rather it throw an error if it's not there cause like...what the hell am I doing?
[17:07:37] <taplar_busy> i'd rather my logic not break, :)
[17:08:08] <taplar_busy> if your concerned that you think your logic should be removing something and that something was not there, that's more of a functional test issue
[17:08:25] <taplar_busy> imho
[17:08:44] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, it's similar to the whole static vs dynamic typing debate IMO.
[17:09:09] <taplar_busy> yeah i know guys who hate dynamic typing
[17:10:49] <taplar_busy> is it dynamic typing or nontyping?
[17:11:23] <DeltaHeavy> taplar_busy Dynamic typing
[17:11:27] <DeltaHeavy> I don't like dynamic typing
[17:12:54] <taplar_busy> ooc do you consider the concept in java of parameters as interfaces and passing in implementations to be dynamic typing?
[17:13:56] <DeltaHeavy> I never did Java.
[17:14:11] <taplar_busy> ah
[17:14:26] <decx> throwing an error for empty selectors?
[17:14:27] <DeltaHeavy> Java isn't a dynamically typed language AFAIK though
[17:14:40] <DeltaHeavy> decx Non-existant element references
[17:14:56] <decx> always exists tho
[17:14:57] <DeltaHeavy> I know C# is OPTIONALLY dynamically typed but I pretend it's not.
[17:15:04] <DeltaHeavy> decx It should yeah
[17:15:26] <DeltaHeavy> Idk how you'd ever run into a situation where you'd need .remove() to check if it's on a DOM element
[17:15:48] <DeltaHeavy> Like...if it's not a DOM element it doesn't have .remove() and now you're just making a mess out of references.
[17:16:04] <DeltaHeavy> Like...it's not a DOM element its referencing anymore
[17:16:17] <decx> remove already does that
[17:16:30] <DeltaHeavy> Talking about Element.prototype.remove
[17:16:40] <decx> ah
[17:17:05] <decx> is that new?
[17:17:22] <taplar_busy> i kinda draw a distinction.  remove on Element i could see, but remove on $ is applying it to the result stack
[17:17:42] <taplar_busy> you just have nothing to apply it to
[18:05:04] <Xatenev> Anybody knows a good way to detect if we scrolled to the end of the page?
[18:06:17] <robertmaxrees> use a scroll event listener, check the window scrollTop()
[19:23:47] <leftover> hey, kind of general javascript question, but when you attach javascript to inputs, is it better to add an event to the id, or have the input fire a javascript function?
[19:23:55] <leftover> to an input form that is
[19:24:02] <robertmaxrees> add an event handler.
[19:24:15] <leftover> ok thanks
[19:24:25] <leftover> can you explain benefits?
[19:25:23] <robertmaxrees> decouples logic from presentation.
[19:25:31] <robertmaxrees> keeps your js in js files.
[19:25:37] <robertmaxrees> stuff like that.
[19:26:19] <compact> hi, i have
[19:26:19] <compact>             $(".input-text").fadeOut(500);
[19:26:31] <leftover> ah ic, makes sense
[19:26:31] <compact> it works in current tab, however it won't fade in another tab
[19:26:32] <compact> any idea
[19:26:32] <leftover> thanks
[19:26:41] <robertmaxrees> leftover definitely.
[19:26:59] <robertmaxrees> compact you mean a browser tab, or a tab control?  or....?
[19:27:13] <compact> browser tab
[19:27:17] <compact> it fades in current tab
[19:28:03] <robertmaxrees> ooold issue.
[19:29:40] <compact> old or odd? :P
[19:29:44] <robertmaxrees> old
[19:30:19] <leftover> also, when you add code to a seperate file that needs to wait for on load, is there some better way than doing window.onload = function(), I always hate wrapping everything in this
[19:30:32] <robertmaxrees> leftover window.load or document ready?
[19:30:49] <robertmaxrees> in general, you can just link your js at the bottom of the page.
[19:31:06] <leftover> um, aren't they the same?
[19:31:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:31:17] <robertmaxrees> document ready and window load are two very distinct events.
[19:31:30] <leftover> don't they both wait for html to be loaded though, so you can attach events
[19:31:42] <robertmaxrees> window load happens much later.
[19:31:54] <robertmaxrees> thats after all script/css/img tags have finished loading.
[19:32:04] <robertmaxrees> you only need to wait for document ready most of the time.
[19:32:29] <robertmaxrees> or just put your code at the bottom of the page.
[19:36:15] <compact> robertmaxrees, is there a fix around it
[19:36:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to search google.
[19:37:50] <leftover> is there some guide on how to read the global namespace, like see what functions are available, I don't really have a  good way to look at the page and see what's available
[19:38:03] <robertmaxrees> leftover you mean like in javascript?
[19:38:08] <robertmaxrees> or for your specific page?
[19:38:20] <leftover> kind of like chrome developer I can reverse engineer things in html and css
[19:38:29] <leftover> but, when i have javascript on a page, I can't really trace things
[19:38:29] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[19:38:38] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean figure out what modified what?
[19:38:51] <leftover> and what's calling what, and following the code
[19:38:59] <leftover> kind of like how an ide would link functions
[19:39:00] <robertmaxrees> that's called a step debugger.
[19:39:15] <leftover> oh ok, I should research that
[19:39:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, something like vscode can do some of that.
[19:39:35] <robertmaxrees> you can step code in js, and you can use some analysis tools to do some of that.
[19:39:42] <robertmaxrees> but js is pretty weak for those kinds of features.
[19:40:00] <leftover> what would i search to look for a chrome extension
[19:40:08] <leftover> i'm sure someone has built something.
[19:40:13] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about a step debugger?
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> or something like intellisense?
[19:42:31] <leftover> i'm not sure, just something to make viewing the structure and tracking of javascript actions easier
[19:42:40] <leftover> im kind of just searching "javascript debugger"
[19:42:47] <robertmaxrees> so there's nothing totally comprehensive that'll do that for you.
[19:42:57] <robertmaxrees> your browser dev tools can show you what handlers are bound to an element.
[19:42:58] <VeryBewitching> WebStorm
[19:43:01] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you part of the way there.
[19:43:13] <VeryBewitching> (I might have that name wrong, one sec..)
[19:43:19] <robertmaxrees> webStorm supports some of that, though your browser has a good amount of those tools built-in.
[19:43:33] <robertmaxrees> vscode or sublime with some plugisn could help get you there.
[19:43:58] <leftover> ok, and just to clarify 'step debugger" is what I'm looking for?
[19:44:13] <VeryBewitching> leftover: Something that took me a while to start doing is full-screening the developer tools window
[19:44:28] <VeryBewitching> leftover: I have 8 desktops though, so I'm not sure if that's for everyone.
[19:45:09] <robertmaxrees> leftover no.
[19:45:35] <leftover> what I'd like to get to the point is, being able to hit ana anlysis on a webpage and be able to understand all the javascript that is going on, and understand whats happening, right now I can hit chrome developer and see the javascript, but I have to figure out myself what's going on
[19:46:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:46:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:46:22] <robertmaxrees> that's really generic.
[19:46:40] <leftover> well if I knew my question I'd probably know the answer too
[19:46:54] <VeryBewitching> leftover: Let me suggest that the more you do that, the faster you'll get at processing it.
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that you need a few different tools together with experience
[19:47:48] <kneekoo> hello, what am I missing here? https://jsfiddle.net/59dxLssz/3/ clicking [+]/[-] should toggle the div I hid on load
[19:48:14] <leftover> ok what would be the best 3 tools
[19:49:46] <VeryBewitching> leftover: You know when you inspect an element on the page by right-clicking on it?  That little pane has a button that lets you detatch it.  It's what I use every day to debug JavaScript (and the occasional console.log)
[19:49:59] <VeryBewitching> leftover: I used to debug JavaScript before that existed.  :D
[19:50:47] <VeryBewitching> If you detatch and maximize it, you'll have a full-screen view of the elements, debugging, network traffic; when it's that size it makes life easier.
[19:51:09] <leftover> ok, I've been looking for a guide to debugging javascript using the chrome developer tool, haven't found one yet though
[19:51:28] <VeryBewitching> leftover: How long have you been writing JavaScript?
[19:52:09] <leftover> not long, so I'm looking for tools to help me understand
[19:52:38] <decx> what else did you write
[19:52:55] <leftover> html/css/php
[19:53:02] <leftover> been learning react/js
[19:53:21] <decx> well then just keep at it
[19:53:47] <VeryBewitching> leftover: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools
[19:54:25] <VeryBewitching> leftover: That may clear up a lot of what you're interested in knowing.
[19:54:41] <leftover> ok thanks, i haven't seen that before
[19:54:51] <VeryBewitching> leftover: Have fun :D
[19:54:53] <leftover> sorry my questions are vague, but hard to know what I need before knowing what I need
[19:55:03] <leftover> or asking the right questions*
[19:55:11] <VeryBewitching> It's all good, part of learning is learning how to ask better questions.  :)
[19:55:43] <VeryBewitching> leftover: The tools Chrome or Firefox provide are typically more than enough for most of my uses.
[19:56:24] <robertmaxrees> also: sublime/vscode/atom/etc all have great plugins for some of that.
[19:56:31] <leftover> yeah https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs will be useful, I've searched guides before so surprised I never visited this before
[19:56:39] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com
[19:56:42] <robertmaxrees> a good guide.
[19:57:28] <VeryBewitching> robertmaxrees: Hadn't seen that before, interesting name.
[19:59:44] <kneekoo> robertmaxrees: nice! :)
[20:02:52] <robertmaxrees> great guide.
[20:03:55] <kneekoo> a bit over my head at the moment, as I'm trying to figure out why a simple hide/show on click doesn't work :))
[20:04:39] <kneekoo> would someone please take a look? https://jsfiddle.net/59dxLssz/3/
[20:06:02] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[20:06:07] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of code to hide/show something.
[20:06:38] <robertmaxrees> also: it's .container, not #container for classes.
[20:07:11] <kneekoo> wow...
[20:07:18] <kneekoo> I missed that
[20:07:38] <kneekoo> my deepest gratitude! :))
[20:09:13] <kneekoo> but something's not adding up
[20:10:14] <kneekoo> that was supposed to be $('#switch')
[20:10:34] <kneekoo> I'll check the code again
[20:13:03] <kneekoo> https://jsfiddle.net/59dxLssz/5/
[20:13:55] <kneekoo> my goal is to have the [+]/[-] toggle the second div block
[20:18:02] <kneekoo> I cleaned up the code a little bit by shortening my clumsy debugging technique :P https://jsfiddle.net/59dxLssz/6/
[20:24:24] <kneekoo> why doesn't jQuery pick up the clicks on #switch?
[20:30:39] <kneekoo> ok, I found out
[20:32:21] <kneekoo> I must declare the event listeners AFTER changing the HTML
[20:49:22] <kneekoo> although I found the answer on StackOverflow, I just found it in fixingthesejquery.com also - slide #20 :)
[21:47:03] <oily> hey, when you use addEvenListener to a form, are the input values accessible as part of the event?
[21:52:22] <oily> like, i don't see a way, but it seems ideally the values of a form would be passed through the event... yet doesn't
[21:52:31] <oily> submit
