[05:31:30] <jquery215> How i can make when i click this div page scrolls to some div?
[06:09:18] <Audlex-> jquery215: have you googled it? there are a good few options out there.
[07:56:28] <adv_> http://www.designchemical.com/blog/index.php/jquery/live-text-search-function-using-jquery/ , how can i combine this with http://jsfiddle.net/crustyashish/rGrvf/1/
[07:56:35] <adv_> i don't know how to hide the selected div if the searchTerm matches
[08:30:43] <groton> is there a method of jquery that works without a document? something like a function returning a string, just to make a minimal example of jquery
[10:06:29] <ChDUP> Hi
[10:31:16] <ChDUP> please I try to reproduce this on mywebsite, and it doesn’t work
[10:31:19] <ChDUP> https://jsfiddle.net/brzf1wrL/
[10:34:31] <ChDUP> I don’t understand how I have to « attach » this to document
[10:52:21] <dglambert> morning
[11:11:29] <adv_> how can i combine this structure http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BpBERy with http://www.jqueryscript.net/text/jQuery-Text-Live-Search-Filter-Plugin-HideSeek.html ? the plugin supports div and span but i only have divs
[11:49:49] <qakhan> hi all, i am trying to use variable in selector but its not working.
[11:50:11] <qakhan> i declare a variable when i click on table name (RCDT) and then i use variable as table id
[11:50:19] <qakhan> it seems variable value is not being used in table selector
[11:50:31] <qakhan>  i can get variable value outside of fuction.
[11:50:51] <qakhan> here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/12/
[12:32:52] <adv_> how can i select the parent of this?
[13:06:42] <gerep> Hello good people!
[13:07:00] <gerep> I am making an ajax call to a service and this service is returning me a <table>
[13:07:17] <gerep> And inside this table I have some <col />
[13:07:20] <gerep> And also som <br />
[13:07:46] <gerep> The problem is that when my JS code reads it, it removes the / from <col />, leaving me with <col> and <br>
[13:07:49] <gerep> Is there a way to avoid it?
[13:07:58] <gerep> I need it to be <col /> and <br />
[13:12:23] <gerep> I am getting the response like this:
[13:12:52] <gerep> var body = $(response.body.storage.value);
[13:13:03] <gerep> And the console.log(body);
[13:13:10] <gerep> Already shows the <col> tags
[13:14:26] <shoky> gerep: you are parsing the html into a DOM tree. DOM doesn't have tags or closing tags - it just has nodes with child nodes. the console.log is just displaying it like html to you
[13:14:34] <shoky> gerep: but it's not html anymore
[13:14:46] <shoky> gerep: if you don't want to parse it into a DOM tree.. don't put $() around it ;p
[13:15:37] <shoky> gerep: but  <br> is the same thing as <br/>
[13:16:12] <gerep> shoky: thanks a lot for your answer! The problem is that the service is expecting a <br /> and not a <br> :(
[13:16:31] <gerep> shoky: The other detail now is that I need to add some data to that table
[13:16:55] <gerep> shoky: so maybe not turning the response into a DOM object, I won't be able to add that extra data, right?
[13:17:07] <shoky> gerep: not easily, no
[13:17:30] <gerep> :(
[13:17:41] <gerep> But thanks a for your answer, I wasn't aware of that
[13:35:17] <shakaponk> hello guys, a happy new year!
[13:36:23] <shakaponk> i have an iframe with body 580px + margin-bottom 240px, how can i get total browser independent height?
[13:36:48] <shakaponk> …contentWindow.document.body.offsetHeight works in chrome but in firefox i get only 580
[13:45:16] <shakaponk> nevermind, ….contents().find('html').outerHeight(true) did it
[14:27:48] <jonah> hi can anyone help. I have a basic registration form which I've put within a MagnificPopup window. It works great except for if the form isn't filled in correctly, instead of seeing the validation errors the MagnificPopup form closes off. If you click to open it again the errors are there, but does anyone know how I can submit the form and keep the MagnificPopup window open so errors can be seen if they are there? thanks for any help :)
[15:25:50] <grumbero> hi
[15:29:32] <grumbero> i have a modal window with 270 links on it of the same class. i register a click-event to all of them. if i click on one it is removed from this list. the click on some links they work just fine, but on some in the middle the click-event isn't triggered at all. any idea how i could debug this?
[15:30:13] <grumbero> if i click on all the links from the start they all work but not if i start with some of them in the middle. i just can't see a pattern
[15:44:57] <grumbero> it is really strange, the click event is bound correctly, it just isn't fired. any idea?
[18:02:12] <roadrunneratwast> hi. has anyone here used fullcalendar?  do they allow "dow" to be set on any event?  it does not say this in the documentation but seems implied elsewhere
[19:29:04] <rockwood> in jquery ajax i want to use my php base function in url string
[19:29:23] <rockwood> is it possible ?
[20:19:17] <carpii> anyone have any experience using jqWidgets as an alternative to jQueryUI?  It seems ok so far, but its a little quirky in places so I wonder if Im best aborting before I get too far in
