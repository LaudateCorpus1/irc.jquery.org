[00:49:56] <mistergibson> Is there a separate channel for jQuery-UI discussion?
[00:50:04] <mistergibson> ... or is this the place?
[00:51:59] <Woet> it does mention jQuery UI in the topic
[00:52:01] <Woet> so yea, this is the place
[02:02:11] <DreamStiffy> hi guys
[02:02:30] <DreamStiffy> Cork: u there matey?
[02:02:31] <DreamStiffy> https://jsfiddle.net/hokseyt4/
[02:02:41] <DreamStiffy> i have no where to host the json file
[02:02:51] <DreamStiffy> all im wondering on how do i get no1 and no2
[02:02:53] <DreamStiffy> anyone
[02:03:03] <DreamStiffy> or what the term is
[02:05:37] <moveax> DreamStiffy: $.getJSON("/jsonfile.js", function(result){ console.log(result) }
[02:05:43] <moveax> inspect the data
[02:06:02] <moveax> result itself is not an array
[02:06:39] <moveax> i would do: $.each(result.tabledata, function(key, value) { // stuff });
[02:09:15] <DreamStiffy> so if its not an array wat do i call it
[02:09:21] <moveax> object
[02:09:21] <DreamStiffy> so i can search google
[02:09:26] <DreamStiffy> dang it
[02:09:47] <DreamStiffy> so how do i select an object
[02:12:08] <DreamStiffy> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5288833/how-to-search-json-tree-with-jquery
[02:12:11] <DreamStiffy> thanks moveax
[03:35:00] <DreamStiffy> ok i didnt quite get it just now
[03:35:06] <DreamStiffy> pls refer to : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16586387/json-get-child-value
[03:35:35] <DreamStiffy> my json is as per the question
[03:36:05] <DreamStiffy> but in the answer , it declares it as variable. how can i declare if im not sure what actual value are in the json file
[03:36:13] <DreamStiffy> i may know the structure
[03:36:23] <DreamStiffy> so how do i get the child value of a json
[03:36:55] <DreamStiffy> the parent values are fine, but child values returns object object
[03:38:20] <DreamStiffy> Cork: baby?
[03:38:27] <DreamStiffy> i rephrase
[03:38:32] <DreamStiffy> Cork: Master
[04:03:50] <hellyeah> lets say there is a long text and when you mouse over yuou will see type is swiped from left to right. Text normally is really long
[04:04:01] <hellyeah> the event for that is focus or mouseenter
[04:06:56] <DreamStiffy> whats the question
[04:07:00] <DreamStiffy> marquee you mean?
[04:07:53] <hellyeah> there şs a table
[04:07:56] <hellyeah> is*
[04:08:05] <hellyeah> and text is really long in one column
[04:08:23] <hellyeah> i just want to show some part of the text and when you mouse over the column
[04:08:32] <hellyeah> text will be swiped from left to right
[04:08:39] <hellyeah> i want to do smt like that
[04:11:28] <DreamStiffy> google jquery marquee
[04:12:58] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:20:54] <hellyeah> $('.date).after('<td>' + Date(element.DateMonitor) + '</td></tr>')
[04:21:01] <hellyeah> what is wrong in that line?
[04:26:07] <hellyeah> i see my mistake
[04:29:36] <DreamStiffy> well
[04:29:40] <DreamStiffy> wheres my helper?
[05:11:25] <DreamStiffy> dying here
[05:11:29] <DreamStiffy> anyone can help
[05:22:20] <AdamPDotty> great
[06:03:44] <thykka> DreamStiffy, you mean, you don't know what keys the JSON contains?
[06:03:48] <thykka> or..
[06:09:23] <AdamPDotty> Where would the tension be, if he told ?
[06:26:11] <IamTrying> CORRECT: $('video').attr('canPlayType', 'video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"' ); //.canPlayType('video/webm; codecs="vp8"');  like this?
[06:27:44] <AdamPDotty> In most cases it is not sensible to set an attribute after rendering.
[06:29:13] <AdamPDotty> I would suggest using .prop(), but your first version looks correct to me.
[06:29:56] <AdamPDotty> (once we accept <video canPlayType=""> as valid source)
[06:44:15] <DreamStiffy> thykka: im saying that im not sure how to display child value of my json as html.
[06:46:33] <IamTrying> OK
[07:15:22] <DreamStiffy> thykka: https://jsfiddle.net/ke1d21vh/2/
[07:27:10] <thykka> DreamStiffy, something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/ke1d21vh/3/
[07:29:56] <rocketmagnet> hi all
[07:31:03] <rocketmagnet> what wrong with this code ? : https://pastebin.com/1zegzq0B
[07:31:36] <thykka> DreamStiffy, or if you don't want to list the individual keys, but just iterate through all of them; https://jsfiddle.net/thykka/ke1d21vh/4/
[07:32:09] <rocketmagnet> haven't used jquery for a longer time ...
[07:35:42] <thykka> rocketmagnet, what makes you think there's something wrong with it?
[07:35:56] <thykka> oh
[07:35:58] <thykka> right
[07:36:08] <thykka> you're putting objects where you should be putting functions
[07:36:31] <thykka> not .ready({ ... }), but .ready(function() { ... })
[07:36:56] <thykka> or even better, declare those functions and reference them by their names.
[07:38:00] <thykka> so... function handleClick() { ... } $("#mainmenu>div").click(handleClick);
[07:42:24] <DreamStiffy> thykka: pardon my ignorance, i get it that you take those "json" and define it as a variable, because i dont have the actual file anywhere. But, if i do, and i that json is dynamic and im not supposed to alter it in any ways (like define it as a var) how do i do it
[07:42:41] <DreamStiffy> do you understand?
[07:43:22] <thykka> DreamStiffy, in your .getJSON handler, you could do something like var tableData = JSON.parse(result)
[07:43:47] <DreamStiffy> thykka: because most samples online shows similar ways. to declare those as variable. But in my case the file is imported and i have no control over them, so whats the syntax
[07:44:37] <thykka> or.. not sure if jQuery's getJSON automatically parses the json into an object.. either way, the data is available in your 'result' variable
[07:44:50] <DreamStiffy> thykka: ok will try parse...i tried using stringify earlier which i died
[07:45:02] <thykka> stringify converts a JS object into a JSON string
[07:45:10] <thykka> that's the exact opposite of what you want
[07:54:01] <DreamStiffy> thykka: im doing without success
[07:54:59] <thykka> looking at the docs, .getJSON does convert the JSON into an object https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[07:55:06] <thykka> so no need to JSON.parse
[07:55:40] <thykka> just use the callback handler's first argument as the object, in the same way you'd use any JS object
[07:57:36] <dimi1947> is it necessary that filter() can be used only with an arrow finction?can it be used with a non-arrow function
[07:57:45] <dimi1947> ?
[07:57:47] <thykka> dimi1947, not necessary at all
[07:57:58] <thykka> in fact, arrow functions don't even work in some older browsers
[07:58:38] <thykka> not without some kind of a hellish babel setup anyway
[08:01:58] <DreamStiffy> thykka: hmm its not getting through me, well nevermind, ill have to try again tmrw or later
[08:02:14] <DreamStiffy> thank you thykka
[08:02:14] <thykka> DreamStiffy, are you using your browser's developer tools?
[08:02:26] <DreamStiffy> thykka: notepad++
[08:02:37] <DreamStiffy> you want me to print into conole?
[08:02:40] <DreamStiffy> *console
[08:02:41] <thykka> ok, I'd strongly suggest looking into console.log and the step debugger
[08:02:44] <DreamStiffy> and tehn what
[08:02:45] <thykka> they're essential
[08:03:07] <DreamStiffy> the key question is my js sucks and i dont know how to call the child
[08:03:09] <DreamStiffy> thats it
[08:06:26] <dimi1947> https://hastebin.com/ijavunojij.cs I cannot find what is wrong with this syntax...Netbeans gives me error
[08:07:27] <dimi1947> I found it..probably...no need to bother
[08:14:46] <hellyeah-work> hey
[08:14:51] <hellyeah-work> i am using this $('.dateColumn').append('<td>' + moment(element.DateMonitor).format("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss") + '</td></tr>')
[08:15:08] <hellyeah-work> but ş see [object object] on the screen
[08:15:19] <hellyeah-work> i can add td to the table
[08:15:36] <hellyeah-work> but at the same time i see [object object]
[08:15:42] <hellyeah-work> how can i avoid that
[08:16:22] <hellyeah-work> any advice?
[08:21:44] <hellyeah-work> i have an idea that will solve my issue
[08:21:47] <dimi1947> filter() must allways return true or false?
[08:42:40] <MikeD_> dimi1947: yes
[08:43:31] <MikeD_> technically, "truthy" or "falsey" but that can be weird when you return 0 and you think you're returning a number but it's treated as false, so ymmv
[09:09:59] <dimi1947> so this code here must be wrong:https://hastebin.com/amerahefab.js
[09:10:35] <ceiba_> you should fiddle it
[09:11:19] <dimi1947> why?
[09:11:46] <dimi1947> I mean it is not suppose to be working anyway
[09:21:26] <thykka> it's also not how filter is supposed to be used
[09:22:09] <Levin^> hi
[09:22:18] <thykka> filter should take a collection and return a subset of that collection, without causing side-effects
[09:22:24] <Levin^> I found this code somewhere
[09:22:25] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mpBopx
[09:22:34] <thykka> if you want side-effects, use .each
[09:22:43] <Levin^> it's runnin on a very old jquery version
[09:23:00] <Levin^> but it won't run on the latest version. why?
[09:23:31] <thykka> Levin^, .live is deprecated
[09:23:43] <Levin^> oh
[09:23:48] <thykka> change that to .on
[09:24:33] <Levin^> thanks! it worked
[09:44:22] <Levin^> I'm trying to invert what this jquery does
[09:44:22] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mpBopx
[09:44:36] <Levin^> it currently convert images to links
[09:44:58] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xpXBjg
[09:45:12] <Levin^> here I'm trying to convert links to images
[09:46:00] <Levin^> but it seems it's not as simple as just replacing all the current values to new ones
[09:51:52] <thykka> Levin^, https://codepen.io/anon/pen/wprZMV
[09:55:04] <Levin^> thykka: wow, you completely minified the code lol
[10:02:52] <thykka> thought it'd be best to omit the irrelevant parts
[10:27:54] <Levin^> thykka: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zpEXJW?editors=1010
[10:28:18] <Levin^> how to I do the .append() to keep each link in place?
[10:28:38] <thykka> you wanna replace the existing links with images?
[10:28:46] <Levin^> yes
[10:29:05] <taplar> replaceWith()
[10:29:06] <Levin^> that html will stay as html
[10:29:09] <Levin^> hmm
[10:30:36] <thykka> Levin^, https://codepen.io/anon/pen/PEJvwN
[10:31:08] <thykka> (you named the jQuery collection of links as $filetypes, which is a bit misleading IMO)
[10:31:50] <thykka> ((it's not a collection of file types, it's a collection of links, narrowed down by certain filetypes))
[10:32:07] <Levin^> hm
[10:32:13] <Levin^> I see
[10:32:49] <thykka> not a terrible mistake, but doesn't really help code legibility when things aren't what they're called :)
[10:32:51] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/VyMOvZ
[10:33:53] <thykka> ^ this is better, I didn't remember jQuery had .replaceWith
[10:34:55] <Levin^> and $target = $("#div1"); is not needed anymore
[10:35:22] <taplar> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ypzWOv
[10:36:39] <Levin^> thanks :)
[10:37:36] <Levin^> wow that code got really reduced in size
[10:37:57] <taplar> i thought i recalled replaceWith could take a function
[10:41:32] <thykka> okay, so the one-liner is
[10:41:35] <thykka> $("#btnImageToLinkConvert").click(function(){$('a[href$="jpg"],a[href$="png"],a[href$="gif"]').replaceWith(function(){return $("<img>",{src:this.href})});});
[10:42:06] <Bugje> unreadable as  onle-liner
[10:42:12] <taplar> ^
[10:42:18] <thykka> yes :)
[10:42:36] <taplar> i'd also prefer a class lookup for those links
[10:42:40] <Bugje> If the whole sourcefile is like that, it's really hard to debug
[10:42:54] <thykka> taplar, perhaps, but that depends entirely on the use-case
[10:43:05] * Bugje is everywhere even in one-liners
[10:43:19] <taplar> what do you mean the use case?
[10:44:05] <thykka> taplar, I mean sometimes one doesn't have control over the html, and can't simply add the classes to the relevant elements
[10:44:13] <taplar> sure
[10:44:33] <thykka> and sometimes adding classes might not be practical for other reasons
[10:45:09] <thykka> but yes, if it is possible to add classes, that would be safer. Or even a data-attr
[10:46:57] <taplar> i'd go with a class over a data-attr.  more performant
[10:48:03] <taplar> and $('.replaceWithImage') is both more readable and informative as to what should happen to the element
[10:50:14] <Bugje> Why everybody still use .click(function() instead of .on('click', function() :|
[10:50:30] <taplar> still works, :)
[10:50:35] <Bugje> wb BigWings
[10:50:58] <taplar> and devs love to type less
[10:51:33] * Bugje start a phonecall to jQuery to depecrate .method(function() in next release!
[12:35:57] <Levin^> I decided on adding classes
[12:36:19] <Levin^> it makes much easier for many reasons
[12:37:33] <taplar> awesome
[12:46:05] <dimi1979> robertmaxrees:line 10-14 https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/37/   this is your code if you can remember and I must make a change to it...or I will have to change the HTML for the following reason:click edit,then cancel and click edit again...the DOM ought to change and it does not
[12:47:56] <robertmaxrees> so what's the change yo need to make?
[12:47:57] <taplar> your replacind the element with the event binding on it
[12:48:09] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:48:14] <robertmaxrees> also: var fieldsetCount = $('#serv').length;
[12:48:16] <robertmaxrees> this will always be 1
[12:49:03] <taplar> or 0
[12:49:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ yeah
[12:49:57] <dimi1979> did you make the actions I describe so you can understand what is the problem...
[12:50:06] <grapheti> I won't forget you 0.
[12:50:10] <taplar> lol
[12:50:22] <grapheti> lol
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> dimi1979 uh.... i don't remember writing any of that heh
[12:51:10] <dimi1979> robertmaxrees:ok forget that and focus on the problem...did you understand what is the problem
[12:51:16] <robertmaxrees> dude
[12:51:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only person that can help.
[12:51:32] <robertmaxrees> 2 different issues have been tossed out your way :)
[12:51:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd address those first.
[12:51:46] <dimi1979> which issues?
[12:52:00] <robertmaxrees> ^ read up.
[12:52:13] <robertmaxrees> taplar pointed one out about event bindings and i noted one about the length check.
[12:53:00] <dimi1979> at what line is that check?
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> ^ the line of code is up above.
[12:53:51] <robertmaxrees> ctrl+f is your friend :)
[13:00:44] <dimi1979> the only problel with var fieldsetCount = $('#serv').length; is that #serv does not exist...is the the problem?
[13:01:37] <robertmaxrees> are you checking to see if it exists or to see how many of those elements there are?
[13:02:40] <dimi1979> it does NOT exist...that is what is important...I cannot remember why I put this there
[13:02:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:05:43] <dimi1979> try to be more specfic pls....maybe I miss something
[13:05:54] <robertmaxrees> with which part?
[13:06:09] <robertmaxrees> the issue taplar noted?
[13:06:14] <dimi1979> what are you trying to say with "heh"?
[13:06:27] <taplar> i may have been wrong with the bind thing
[13:06:35] <taplar> i'm debugging righ tnow
[13:06:50] <dimi1979> taplar:my code?
[13:06:59] <robertmaxrees> dimi1979 it was a small chuckle becauise you had code in there but couldn't remember why you put it there in th3e first place.
[13:07:04] <robertmaxrees> we've all been there before.
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[13:07:15] <dimi1979> ok
[13:07:40] <taplar> .filter((i, e) => $('.value', e).length === 1)
[13:07:46] <taplar> this is false the second time around
[13:08:11] <taplar> you can put: debugger;
[13:08:21] <taplar> in your code before the logic and then step through it, test conditionals
[13:11:57] <dimi1979> it should not be false....
[13:12:33] <taplar> so what does that tell you?
[13:13:25] <dimi1979> which thing exactly?
[13:13:35] <taplar> the thing you just said
[13:13:52] <taplar> it shouldn't be false.  but it is.  so....
[13:14:27] <dimi1979> first things first...I want to acually see that false values you are talking about in dev tools
[13:14:47] <taplar> so put this on line 6
[13:14:49] <taplar> debugger;
[13:14:55] <taplar> and open your console
[13:15:16] <dimi1979> in fiddle?
[13:15:22] <taplar> yes
[13:15:48] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide11
[13:16:01] <taplar> go through these slides, they will explain with pictures the debugger
[13:18:09] <dimi1979> from what I understand the debugger statement must enter after a semicolon... correct?
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other js statement.
[13:19:26] <dimi1979> I am saying that cause in line 6 in the fiddle there is no a semecolon after which I can place the debugger statement
[13:19:49] <taplar> so to the start of line 6, hit enter
[13:19:56] <taplar> go back up to line 6
[13:19:57] <taplar> lol
[13:20:10] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/lQksqiK.png
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> this is why he's confused.
[13:20:25] <taplar> i know
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> ah, you're saying add a debugger for the click handler.
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> gotcha :)
[13:21:04] <taplar> after the originals declaration
[13:21:21] <dimi1979> ok...now I got it
[13:21:43] <taplar> so now run your script and click the button
[13:23:12] <dimi1979> ok...code execution stopped at the debugger statement...
[13:23:55] <taplar> ok, now you see the code in your developer tools?
[13:23:56] <dimi1979> Am I suppose to observe anything with it?
[13:24:09] <dimi1979> yes
[13:24:14] <taplar> what browser are you in btw?
[13:24:57] <dimi1979> chrome
[13:25:02] <taplar> sweet
[13:25:12] <taplar> ok, so on the right hand side, you see the "Watch" tab?
[13:25:41] <taplar> actually before that
[13:26:03] <taplar> so what you've done is put a breakpoint in your logic.  the browser has stopped performing while this is happening
[13:26:19] <taplar> what this allows you to do is look at variables, but also, you can test things
[13:26:38] <taplar> right now, you could switch over to the console and type "originals" and it would print out the array
[13:27:02] <taplar> even though it's a private variable in your method, because you are paused debugging in that method, so your browser is treating that as your scope
[13:27:22] <taplar> so if you want to you can switch to the console and do
[13:27:24] <dimi1979> I know all these...
[13:27:31] <taplar> $('.show_price').find('.value').length
[13:27:41] <taplar> and you should see a # > 0
[13:27:51] <dimi1979> just a minute
[13:27:54] <taplar> so you understand this and how to use watch expressions?
[13:28:51] <dimi1979> more or less yes...I see nowhere though  $('.show_price').find('.value').length
[13:29:12] <taplar> you have to type that in your console
[13:29:20] <dimi1979> is it under the scope pane?
[13:29:27] <taplar> in the developer tools
[13:29:49] <taplar> you should see the tabs like "Elements", "Console", "Sources", ...
[13:29:56] <dimi1979> yes....under the scope pane in the developer tools
[13:30:12] <taplar> yep, so type that command in your console to see how many show price have value elements
[13:30:14] <dimi1979> in the sources of course
[13:30:17] <Bugje> Welcome to the course develop in the evening on IRC!
[13:30:27] <Bugje> Have fun people :)
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> the scope pane will only show variables, not all statements in the scope.
[13:30:42] <dimi1979> ok....give me a second to do it
[13:31:02] <robertmaxrees> dimi1979 do you understand why taplar is having you do this?
[13:31:16] <dimi1979> to learn of course
[13:31:28] <robertmaxrees> and do you see how it relates back to fixing your problem?
[13:31:38] <dimi1979> not yet
[13:32:13] <taplar> when performing a logical chain like X & Y -> Z
[13:32:20] <taplar> X and Y have to be true
[13:32:27] <taplar> if you can debug and see if X or Y are false
[13:32:36] <taplar> you have a starting point of going backwards to see -why-
[13:32:52] <dimi1979> taplar:did you say to me to run  $('.show_price').find('.value').length; in the console?
[13:32:57] <taplar> yep
[13:33:44] <dimi1979> well...I do not get true/false but only 3...which makses sense of course
[13:33:51] <taplar> alright
[13:34:03] <taplar> so we can make the small assumption that they all have a value
[13:34:16] <taplar> which is related to the filter, right?
[13:34:33] <dimi1979> yes
[13:34:50] <taplar> ok, so now, so we don't have to keep typing that in the console, we can create a watch expression for that
[13:35:05] <taplar> switch back to your source tab, and find that "Watch" area again
[13:36:25] <dimi1979> so am I suppose to watch  $('.show_price').find('.value').length;????
[13:36:30] <taplar> yup
[13:37:21] <dimi1979> ok....3 is output again
[13:37:45] <taplar> yep.  so right now, on the first click of the element, all of them have a value
[13:37:55] <taplar> so now click the play button on your screen and let it run
[13:37:57] <dimi1979> just a minute
[13:38:51] <dimi1979> so I click edit....code execution stops and then hit code resume....is that what are you telling me?
[13:39:03] <taplar> two
[13:39:09] <taplar> fk, home keys
[13:39:10] <taplar> sorry
[13:39:12] <taplar> yes
[13:39:45] <taplar> after that, if you click cancel, and click the button again, you should be at the debug again
[13:39:54] <taplar> BUT, you should see that your watch is now returning 0
[13:40:07] <dimi1979> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
[13:40:20] <taplar> meaning none of your elements have child element with the value class
[13:40:35] <dimi1979> and that is the problem for which I started here
[13:40:37] <dimi1979> today
[13:40:43] <taplar> yep
[13:40:51] <taplar> but now, you know more about using the debugger!
[13:41:05] <taplar> and can apply this knowledge to figuring out -why- that is the case
[13:41:14] <dimi1979> question:why not set breakpoints?
[13:41:30] <taplar> elaborate?
[13:41:30] <dimi1979> instead of using the debugger statement
[13:41:43] <taplar> you mean clicking the line number?
[13:41:56] <dimi1979> yes...in dev tools
[13:42:00] <taplar> either way works
[13:42:05] <dimi1979> its the same
[13:42:17] <taplar> debugger; is nice for big files so it jumps to the line in the developer tools
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> just a different workflot.
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> *workflow
[13:42:45] <dimi1979> anyway...how to solve the problem...need to restructure my HTML?what do you propose?
[13:42:53] <taplar> and i'd rather explain to you how to type "debugger;" then trying to get you to find the right line number and click it
[13:42:57] <robertmaxrees> well, what's the core of your issue?
[13:45:05] <dimi1979> there is a problem with the HTML when cancel is clicked...it is altered and then edit is useless
[13:45:43] <taplar> because, at least for now, we see the value elements are gone
[13:46:42] <taplar> actions: 1) edit, 2) cancel, 3) edit
[13:46:48] <taplar> one of those three things removed the value elements
[13:47:02] <dimi1979> yes....
[13:47:12] <taplar> so now you have to figure out which one
[13:47:19] <taplar> and determine if that is valid or not
[13:47:25] <dimi1979> anyway...I am tired...let me see what I can do my self
[13:47:40] <taplar> kinda what we're trying to coax you to do here man
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:48:04] <dimi1979> coax=coach?
[13:48:17] <robertmaxrees> coax, as in "lead"
[13:48:19] <taplar> encourage enthusasticly
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:48:29] <robertmaxrees> another good way to put it.
[13:48:51] <dimi1979> so then...I will try to solve it my own
[14:37:00] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[14:38:06] <grapheti> yeeeeehawwww
[15:17:22] <Levin^> hi
[15:18:48] <Levin^> is there a way of hiding text from a <p>, if that <p> have a <img> inside?
[15:18:59] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:19:00] <Levin^> here's the example html: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MrOYGo
[15:19:05] <Levin^> really? :o
[15:19:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find all p tags that contain an img tag?
[15:19:24] <Levin^> yes
[15:19:37] <robertmaxrees> you can use .filter() for that.
[15:19:44] <robertmaxrees> and pass it a function.
[15:19:53] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:21:46] <Levin^> can I make it hide the text inside the <p> tag, but avoid hiding the <img> tag that's inside?
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> well.
[15:22:14] <robertmaxrees> to make this 1000x easier, can you modify the html?
[15:22:25] <Levin^> no, I can't
[15:22:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:22:34] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:22:37] <Levin^> its contents are from a feed
[15:22:54] <Levin^> it have cron and will be imported each 6 hours
[15:23:06] <Levin^> can't really edit every post
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> will you need to retain the text?
[15:23:17] <Levin^> no
[15:23:38] <Levin^> that piece of text is not needed
[15:23:52] <robertmaxrees> you could select the image and then do a .html(theImg)
[15:24:41] <robertmaxrees> so something like $('p').filter(function that checks if it has an image).each(function that replaces the contents of the p with just the img node)
[15:28:39] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[15:28:50] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: check this code:
[15:28:51] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NXaVrg
[15:28:58] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:29:03] <Levin^> this is what is happening to my code right now
[15:29:19] <Levin^> the structure is very similar to my site
[15:29:30] <Levin^> the images are converted from links as you see
[15:29:45] <robertmaxrees> same basic premise as before.
[15:30:14] <Levin^> do you think I could keep using the selectors of this code to expand the selection and make the <p> content to be hidden?
[15:30:21] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[15:30:34] <Levin^> so I should make a separated function
[15:30:46] <robertmaxrees> i would use an .each() to do this tbh.
[15:31:34] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[15:32:57] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/goXbEb?editors=1010
[15:33:01] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[15:35:17] <Levin^> ohh
[15:35:34] <robertmaxrees> having the original example would've been helpful from the start ;)
[15:35:54] <Levin^> you basicaly replaced the selector with some content from inside
[15:36:12] <Levin^> so other contents were "ignored"
[15:36:38] <robertmaxrees> the element.
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[15:37:12] <Levin^> yes
[15:37:14] <robertmaxrees> if it has a link whose href contains an image extension, replace the contents of the p with an img tag.
[15:37:27] <Levin^> hmm
[15:37:29] <Levin^> interesting
[15:37:34] <Levin^> thanks
[15:37:38] <Levin^> I understand now

[18:06:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:07:45] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want the data-idperson attribute value of the selected optionm?
[18:09:42] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[18:34:46] <taplar> lol
[18:35:18] <robertmaxrees> welp

[18:58:28] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[18:58:33] <robertmaxrees> already asked pertinent questions :)
[18:58:50] <jak2000> robertmaxrees... sorry i am disconnected and not see if answered...
[18:59:00] <jak2000> sorry really sorry, you see if answered?
[18:59:36] <robertmaxrees> i asked if you are trying to get the data-idperson value from the selected option.
[18:59:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:00:04] <robertmaxrees> also: value-'321' - i think you mean value='321'
[19:00:07] <taplar> and the highlighting of the html shows a markup error
[19:01:39] <jak2000> fixed: https://jsfiddle.net/v7hz7a0w/1/   :)
[19:01:52] <robertmaxrees> `soooo
[19:02:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the data-idperson value from the selected option?
[19:02:13] <jak2000> yes
[19:02:24] <robertmaxrees> so real quick: why not the value?
[19:02:27] <jak2000> if user type in the input text: 205
[19:02:36] <taplar> 1) How do you select an element?  2) How do you reference it's data field?  3) how do so set the value on an element?
[19:02:43] <jak2000> i want set this option data-idperson ='205
[19:03:00] <taplar> this is pretty low level stuff
[19:03:06] <robertmaxrees> why don't the values match?
[19:03:14] <robertmaxrees> 'cause this would be wicked easy if they were the same.
[19:03:40] <jak2000> yes i know with values..... but i need the value of other purposes.....
[19:04:52] <jak2020> sorry bad internet...
[19:05:06] <taplar> so what about this is confusing you?
[19:05:21] <jak2020> is correct use foreach?
[19:05:25] <jak2020> and compare item by item
[19:05:31] <taplar> wait hold on
[19:05:33] <jak2020> the selectoption have so so MAX 100 items
[19:05:49] <taplar> are you wanting to take the value from the input and change the selected select?
[19:06:05] <taplar> i thought you wanted to go from select to input
[19:06:07] <robertmaxrees> woops
[19:06:33] <taplar> neither is an explicit for each though
[19:07:08] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so you want the value of the input
[19:07:17] <robertmaxrees> and then use that to find a particular option?
[19:08:58] <jak2000> last chance for me... if user type 205 in the input, and data-idperson have the value 205.... i want select this option....
[19:09:15] <taplar> ok, so you can filter to find the element you want
[19:09:27] <jak2000> ok with filter.... googling
[19:09:40] <jak2000> jquery+filter+select+sample
[19:09:46] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:09:53] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 why don't the values match btw?
[19:10:16] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[19:11:45] <taplar> have a great weekend all
[19:11:49] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[19:12:08] <jak2020> robertmaxrees you reocmmend me use value inplace data-idperson?
[19:12:09] <jak2020> robertmaxrees you reocmmend me use value inplace data-idperson?
[19:12:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:12:24] <robertmaxrees> it's really easy if you use the value instead.
[19:12:27] <jak2020> mmm need for other purposes, value..
[19:12:29] <jak2020> yes i know
[19:12:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:12:50] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to use .filter() against the options.
[19:24:55] <jak2000> try: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9uLccrgw/
[19:25:02] <jak2000> but not work (by moment) :)
[19:27:07] <jak2000> robertmaxrees? tapout?
[19:27:08] <robertmaxrees> err...
[19:27:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:27:15] <robertmaxrees> $('#selOperador').val(xValue).filter(function() {
[19:27:22] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9uLccrgw/   <--- wich is bad?
[19:27:33] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing .val().filter()?
[19:27:52] <jak2000> i see this sample:
[19:27:53] <jak2000> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[19:28:11] <jak2000> ooo i see
[19:28:14] <robertmaxrees> i don't see .val() being used anywhere on that page >.>
[19:28:17] <jak2000> return index === 1 || $( this ).attr( "id" ) === "fourth";
[19:28:29] <jak2000> not but i interpret understand
[19:28:31] <robertmaxrees> you're also not filtering on the options.
[19:28:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to filter the option elements.
[19:28:56] <robertmaxrees> and that html error is back.
[19:29:12] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/9uLccrgw/1/
[19:29:17] <jak2000> how to filter on options?
[19:29:31] <robertmaxrees> start by selecting the options.
[19:29:53] <robertmaxrees> $('#selOperador') is getting the select - you want the option elements under that select.
[19:30:11] <jak2000>  $(select).find('option').each(function() {
[19:30:13] <jak2000> something?
[19:30:18] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.
[19:30:46] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't want .val() at all here.
[19:42:56] <pastebin> $('input.115ja').attr('checked', 'disabled'); i got that, and it works - but what is the corresponding code for UNchecked?
[19:43:13] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:43:32] <robertmaxrees> pastebin you want .prop('checked', true) and .prop('checked', false);
[19:43:34] <robertmaxrees> pass booleans.
[19:44:10] <pastebin> Bah, i'm confused! I keep getting help with my code, but it's always changes back and forth =/
[19:44:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:45:30] <robertmaxrees> err, waiot.
[19:45:31] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:45:46] <pastebin> this worked...
[19:46:07] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/gc1g22jw/
[19:46:44] <robertmaxrees> so for boolean attributes you should pass true of false.
[19:46:47] <robertmaxrees> *or
[19:46:52] <robertmaxrees> instead of $('input.115nej').prop('disabled', 'disabled');
[19:46:58] <robertmaxrees> do $('input.115nej').prop('disabled', true);
[19:49:27] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/rLsg58az/
[19:49:29] <pastebin> Like that then?
[19:49:37] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[19:49:54] <pastebin> Alright, awesome! Thank you! :) Makes sense and easier to read!
[19:50:02] <robertmaxrees> :) yep.
[20:05:28] <pastebin> Alright, i REALLY need help now... :D
[20:06:12] <pastebin> The code i'm using, i've gotta use a Switch statement (i come from PHP, so that's what i would do in PHP anyways!) but im NOT sure how to do this with jQuery, and doing it in "If else" will make it super heavy!
[20:08:58] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/rLsg58az/1/ how on earth would i go on turning this into a switch?
[20:31:17] <shoky> pastebin: your 2nd if is missing a condition.. and does the same as the last else block
[20:33:51] <pastebin> shoky - I know, i wanted to turn it into a Switch instead :) Will be too many options
[20:33:55] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/rLsg58az/3/
