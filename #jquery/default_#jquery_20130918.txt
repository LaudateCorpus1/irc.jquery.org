[00:02:05] <jangoh> cork u there
[00:02:12] <Cork> sure
[00:02:16] <jangoh> if i have two button like
[00:02:17] <jangoh>  <button class="btn btn-shopping btn-large back-to-shopping">Back to Shopping</button>
[00:02:17] <jangoh>                 <button class="btn btn-checkout btn-large proceed-to-checkout">Proceed to Checkout</button>
[00:02:29] <jangoh> how do i select 2nd
[00:04:05] <MrTrick> oh wait, I'm on 1.7.2 for some reason...
[00:04:41] <jangoh> Cork?
[00:07:30] <Cork> jangoh: 2nd?
[00:07:45] <jangoh> 2nd button
[00:07:54] <Cork> $('button').eq(1)
[00:08:27] <Cork> or i would just do $('.btn-checkout')
[00:38:25] <funhouse> Hey guys, when writing your classes, do you add a var for your selectors and then just use that var to access them?
[00:38:31] <sammych> so, I found a lightbox that I think fits my description of 'sexy' http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/
[00:38:54] <Cork> funhouse: if you want to work on the same set of elements store the result of $() not the selector string
[00:39:20] <Cork> var elm = $('.my-selector');
[00:39:47] <sammych> but does anyone know of an equally sexy image panning/zoom plugin?
[00:42:35] <funhouse> Cork: ok thank you will do.
[00:43:07] <funhouse> Cork oh I know that, but I'm just saying in your JS classes, do you store the selector in there? Also is there ever any reason a selector would need to beredfined?
[00:43:17] <Cork> oh
[00:43:19] <Cork> lol
[00:43:37] <Cork> funhouse: beredfined?
[00:44:06] <sammych> would that selector ever change/redefined
[00:44:16] <Cork> funhouse: well yes i store the selectors locally in the widget or what it is i'm working with
[00:44:26] <Cork> funhouse: though it isn't always a js "class"
[00:50:59] <_Thoams> mornin all
[00:53:09] <MindSpark> Hello, question to jqmobile devs. Is there a way I can make a page transition like a carousel? I don't want the transition to take place after the swipe is done, but to have the page actually drag during the swipe…
[00:55:34] <funhouse> Cork ok got you thank you.
[01:12:03] <_rgn> this is offtopic and a pretty long show but anyone remember the site online that you input an url with image slideshow and the tool will show you all the images in a single page?
[01:12:15] <oksushi> _rgn: ask #web
[01:13:13] <_rgn> thanks
[01:14:04] <oksushi> _rgn: actually, ignore me — I mistakenly switched channels, and thought you asked a different one :)
[01:14:54] * _rgn /ignores oksushi
[01:15:04] * oksushi deserves it
[01:15:54] <_rgn> using google can be hard when you don't know how to describe what you're looking for
[01:18:39] <Cork> _rgn: some browsers actually let you do that directly in browser ui
[01:23:02] <MindSpark> Jqmobile anyone?
[01:48:18] <dokma> how to repeat the .fileupload on the row appended in done handler here: http://jsfiddle.net/Xvee5/ ??
[01:54:57] <intellix> trying to add an iframe with jQuery and then some content to it. The content has a form and a script which references self.document.forms but that's the parent document, rather than the iframe's document. Is this possible?
[01:55:25] <intellix> the content is trying to redirect somewhere, so I wanted to shove it in an iframe so it's contained and you don't leave the site
[01:59:35] <burg> hello. i am trying to change the href attribute for a <a> node, with $("a").attr("href", value); but jquery seems to htmlencode the value. how can i prevent that?
[02:03:26] <Cork> burg: jquery doesn't
[02:03:34] <Cork> burg: but the dom does, by specification
[02:03:47] <Cork> it is actually invalid to NOT encode the content in there
[02:04:12] <Cork> (but yes browsers error correct that cause it is a very common mistake)
[02:09:42] <intellix> my paste for what I'm trying to do: http://pastebin.com/m1n9R7j2
[02:11:59] <Cork> intellix: don't preparse the html before you append it to a different dom
[02:12:22] <Cork> intellix: also you need to wait for load on the iframe after you create it
[02:12:31] <Cork> else the body won't exist
[02:14:48] <nisseni> I click a button and then I want the value of the .cart_product_id closest to that button: $(self).closest('.cart_product_id').val(); - this returns undefined
[02:15:09] <Cork> nisseni: what do you mean by closest?
[02:15:16] <Cork> is it a child, parent or sibling?
[02:15:24] <nisseni> Cork: sibling
[02:15:26] <Cork> or a sibling of a parent or?
[02:15:51] <jomofcw> Hello !
[02:15:52] <Cork> $(self).siblings('.cart_product_id').val();
[02:16:37] <jomofcw> How could I check if an image is loaded please ?
[02:16:44] <Cork> nisseni: closest looks if the selector matches the element or any of it's parents
[02:16:48] <Cork> nisseni: noting else
[02:17:14] <Cork> jomofcw: you bind a load event on the element before it's added to the dom
[02:17:30] <intellix> thanks Cork
[02:19:25] <jomofcw> Cork Hello, and thanks for your answer. In fact I currrently add a load event to this element. But it seems to be loaded BEFORE the javascript initialized :/.
[02:19:26] <intellix> you say don't preparse it. I'm not doing $('<form></form>') etc. Just passing the string through html();
[02:19:55] <Cork> jomofcw: is the img tag in the static html page?
[02:20:17] <jomofcw> Cork yup !
[02:20:38] <Cork> intellix: well start with the load event, if that still borks for you use the string
[02:20:57] <Cork> intellix: the iframe is a different document, so there are some possible limitations to moving dom elements between them
[02:21:06] <Cork> jomofcw: then use $(window).load()
[02:21:14] <Cork> jomofcw: it will trigger when all images in the page has loaded
[02:21:32] <Cork> jomofcw: you can't bind the dom element fast enough directly
[02:21:43] <jomofcw> Cork OK, I'm trying this !
[02:22:08] <Cork> jomofcw: cause you can't bind the image before domcontentloaded
[02:22:20] <Cork> and if the image is in cache, it might already be loaded at that time
[02:23:15] <jomofcw> Cork it works =) and i understand why now ^^. Thanks for your help =).
[02:23:24] <Cork> np
[02:30:47] <BioMonday> hello
[02:31:04] <BioMonday> is $( function (){ guaranteed to execute after everything id effectively displayed on screen?
[02:31:07] <BioMonday> as in drawed?
[02:31:26] <BioMonday> on chrome I get a 0 height and I am forced to use a timeout
[02:37:12] <Cork> BioMonday: no
[02:37:38] <Cork> it is guaranteed to run after the browser has parsed the entire original html file
[02:37:39] <BioMonday> Cork: what can I use to do that? should I even use jquery? or use window.onload?
[02:37:40] <Cork> nothing else
[02:37:55] <Cork> $(window).load(function() {});
[02:38:00] <BioMonday> hm
[02:38:07] <BioMonday> ok I will try that Cork let me see
[02:38:54] <BioMonday> Cork: still doesn't work on Chrome without a timeout
[02:39:19] <Cork> BioMonday: are you loading things through ajax or similar?
[02:39:53] <BioMonday> Cork: I am creating a blank window, writing html and javasccript to it, and inside that window onload I pass a dom to an outside function
[02:40:16] <Cork> BioMonday: then you can't use load
[02:40:28] <BioMonday> Cork: what should I use instead?
[02:40:36] <Cork> if you write html to the page it will trigger when the window opens
[02:40:42] <BioMonday> Cork: I tried to even use body onload inside my window, but still doesnt work on Chrome
[02:40:42] <Cork> and after that you add the html + js
[02:40:53] <Cork> onload triggers when the original page loads
[02:41:02] <Cork> if you arn't loading an html resource
[02:41:07] <Cork> you are loading about:blank
[02:41:08] <BioMonday> Cork: I do onload inside the window, inside the javascript that I write inside the window
[02:41:13] <Cork> and load will trigger when that is loaded
[02:41:20] <Cork> BioMonday: read my answers
[02:41:36] <BioMonday> Cork: ok I understand, load will trigger immediately then?
[02:41:49] <Cork> no it will trigger when the original page is loaded
[02:41:53] <Cork> not when you add content to it
[02:41:59] <BioMonday> so is there anything I can do?
[02:42:22] <Cork> you could add event listeners for load on the images before you add them to the document
[02:42:59] <BioMonday> I don't have any images on the page unfortunately
[02:55:35] <ricola92> hello
[02:56:31] <ricola92> when an input has got a required attribut and is in a div with display none property , will it be submited when submiting the form?
[02:57:07] <Cork> ricola92: i think it depends on the browser a bit
[02:57:33] <Cork> ricola92: but i think the standard at least don't say that display: none should filter the form
[02:58:04] <Cork> i know ie does some weird things with forms and visibility
[02:58:16] <Cork> but the rest of them don't do anything for form fields based on display
[02:58:27] <ricola92> well i get this message error when submitting my form An invalid form control with name='code_postal_mademoiselle' is not focusable.
[02:58:44] <ricola92> and this input is in a disploy none div
[02:59:18] <Cork> ricola92: so don't make it required + invalid if it's not visible
[03:00:05] <ricola92> but its must be required in my website...
[03:01:10] <Cork> ricola92: then leave it visible
[03:01:36] <Cork> i don't really see the point of having a feeld that must be filled hidden
[03:01:56] <Cork> that kinda makes the whole task of filling it kinda hard
[03:23:45] <Flavier> helo, experiences with QUnit someone?
[03:29:35] <Flavier> someone who want talk about QUnit tests?
[04:02:42] <Syrit> guys, i would like to know what is considered a better pracitce: i have a button inside a div so, is $('#div').children("#button"), considered any better than just $('#button')  ?
[04:04:00] <T13|needsCoffee> Syrit: depends
[04:04:07] <Syrit> on ?
[04:04:09] <Cork> no
[04:04:15] <Cork> the first one is never needed
[04:04:18] <Cork> id is uniq
[04:04:27] <T13|needsCoffee> How many divs and buttons are on the page
[04:04:27] <Syrit> i see
[04:04:29] <Cork> so selecting it based on a parent is just a waist of time
[04:04:55] <Syrit> oh i see, i thought i will make the searching easier for jQ this way
[04:04:57] <Cork> it if was a class on the other hand, the first one would be better
[04:05:14] <Cork> Syrit: browsers has a hash table with all elements with id's in it
[04:05:23] <Syrit> oh, i see
[04:05:30] <Cork> document.getElementById() will return the element matchin the hash
[04:05:33] <Cork> it is super fast
[04:05:41] <T13|needsCoffee> Or if you needed to be able to access the parents siblings
[04:06:07] <Cork> you can still do that from the second selector
[04:06:14] <Syrit> i see
[04:06:24] <Syrit> thank you Cork
[04:06:32] <T13|needsCoffee> You can, but it can involve more work.
[04:06:48] <Syrit> thank you T13|needsCoffee , btw, you should consider drinking Yerba mate, its way better and strong than coffee :D
[04:07:14] <Syrit> oh, unless you mean Coffee script :D
[04:07:42] <T13|needsCoffee> $('div').children('button').each(function(){
[04:07:54] <T13|needsCoffee> For example
[04:08:17] <Syrit> i see
[04:08:36] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: but then it isn't based on the button having an id
[04:08:51] <Syrit> yes, it's simply iterating
[04:08:55] <Syrit> the childs
[04:08:58] <Cork> if you change the structure, then yes using a class on the buttons is prob better
[04:08:58] <T13|needsCoffee> It's all divs with a button
[04:09:16] <T13|needsCoffee> Anyways..
[04:09:27] <Syrit> hence i am using bootstrap, i won't be depending on classes !
[04:09:39] <T13|needsCoffee> Glug glug glug!  Waitress! Another pot please!
[04:09:43] <Cork> Syrit: what do bootstrap have to do with that?
[04:09:58] <Cork> Syrit: we talk about class="different classes here" on the element
[04:10:11] <Syrit> i mean , alot of button share the same classes like .btn . bla bla bla
[04:10:16] <tonph> guys - how can i remove the onlcick from the body ?
[04:10:17] <Syrit> oh, i see
[04:10:36] <T13|needsCoffee> .removeProp() ?
[04:10:58] <Syrit> Thank you guys
[04:11:13] <tonph> any Idea - removeAttr will work ?
[04:11:17] <Cork> Syrit: it is normally the simplest and cleanest ways to add the js logics to the code, cause then you can base it on "group of features should it have"
[04:11:40] <Cork> Syrit: combine that with delegated event listeners, and you can control what different dom elements do by just adding classes to them
[04:11:59] <Syrit> it's still advaced topic to me Cork :D
[04:12:01] <Cork> tonph: yes both removeAttr and removeProp will work
[04:12:09] <T13|needsCoffee> $('body').removeProp('onClick');
[04:12:21] <Cork> onclick please
[04:12:25] <tonph> cork: thanks ...
[04:12:29] <Cork> onClick is ie's format
[04:12:47] <T13|needsCoffee> $('body').removeProp('onClick');  ←← tonph
[04:13:23] <tonph> oh..
[04:14:16] <T13|needsCoffee> .removeProp() is better than .removeAttr() in most cases.
[04:14:23] <AlexanderBB10> Apple's iOS 7: https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1236855_150924248450598_218682194_n.jpg
[04:14:36] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: not really better, they do different things
[04:16:29] <Syrit> well, when i do $('#addContact').removeClass('hide'); the button is removed completley , as i see in the page source !
[04:16:44] <Cork> O_o
[04:16:56] <Cork> Syrit: that line does not remove the element
[04:17:09] <Syrit> it's removed
[04:17:11] <Syrit> but,
[04:17:18] <Cork> not from that line
[04:17:25] <T13|needsCoffee> lol
[04:17:26] <Syrit> in the source i see that the button has class = "btn hide"
[04:18:08] <T13|needsCoffee> Syrit:  is this in a jsfiddle?
[04:18:09] <Cork> Syrit: first no space in attrubute="value"
[04:19:01] <T13|needsCoffee> Unless you're assigning multiple different classes
[04:19:04] <Syrit> oh right, sorry, i was typing it
[04:19:20] <Syrit> it's like this exactly class="btn hide"
[04:19:36] <Syrit> T13|needsCoffee,  no not in jsfiddle
[04:19:44] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: no the space can exist in the value quote, but not between attribute and "!"
[04:19:48] <Cork> *""
[04:19:49] <T13|needsCoffee> So it has classes of .btn and .hide
[04:20:30] <Cork> Syrit: and if you remove the .removeClass('hide') part the element isn't removed?
[04:21:01] <T13|needsCoffee> Oh you mean the foo = " part.
[04:21:06] <T13|needsCoffee> Gotcha
[04:21:17] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: <div class = "class that won't be set">
[04:21:21] <Syrit> yes it isnt
[04:21:35] <Cork> Syrit: so look for the line that causes it instead :)
[04:21:46] <Syrit> actually i will double check the code, may be i am cleaning the entire div *blushing*
[04:21:55] <T13|needsCoffee> Syrit: .removeClass('.hide')
[04:22:01] <Cork> O_o
[04:22:04] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: no
[04:22:32] <Cork> Syrit: make sure the html parses, might be a problem like that
[04:22:43] <Cork> Syrit: w3c validate is a good check to start with
[04:23:19] <Syrit> actually, when i referesh the page, i can see that the button is there with a hide class (in the page source)
[04:23:40] <Cork> Syrit: in the source or in the dom view?
[04:23:46] <T13|needsCoffee> console.log/info/warn/etc() are your friend btw
[04:23:48] <Cork> source doesn't really mean anything
[04:24:15] <Syrit> the page source Cork, the raw html
[04:24:18] <Cork> cause if the html is invalid, the parser might move it around
[04:24:26] <Cork> Syrit: then look in the browsers dom view instead
[04:24:34] <Syrit> i don't know how to do that
[04:24:38] <Cork> what browser?
[04:24:57] <Syrit> Chrome
[04:25:25] <jiangquan> what's matter?
[04:25:55] <Cork> it matters cause if the html is invalid
[04:26:04] <Cork> the elements might move around when it's error corrected
[04:26:18] <Cork> Syrit: and ya, chrome doens't seam to have that...
[04:26:22] <Cork> didn't notice that before...
[04:26:27] <Cork> ?g w3c validate
[04:26:41] <Cork> oh, lovely the bots are dead/slow
[04:26:50] <Cork> Syrit: http://validator.w3.org/
[04:26:51] <T13|needsCoffee> [Ctrl]~[shift]~[k] is your friend too
[04:26:58] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: it won't show it
[04:27:04] <Syrit> sure i found it already Cork
[04:27:04] <Cork> cause it just shows the raw html
[04:27:11] <T13|needsCoffee> IE is not your friend.
[04:27:25] <Cork> it beats chrome in this case actually...
[04:27:35] <Syrit> aah, i am running localhost Cork :/
[04:27:41] <Cork> Syrit: no worry
[04:27:58] <Cork> just copy the html and paste it in the direct input section
[04:28:12] <Syrit> oh okay
[04:28:26] <Cork> or file upload if you prefer that
[04:29:05] <Syrit> only 16 errors  and 11 warnings :D
[04:29:40] <Cork> start by fixing the errors
[04:30:18] <T13|needsCoffee> And not all errors are your code
[04:30:24] <T13|needsCoffee> Use filter
[04:30:52] <Cork> uh, all errors is most likely from the html yes
[04:31:09] <Cork> some can be skipped, but they are still valid errors
[04:31:31] <Syrit> oh, actualy, i am cleaning the dive that contains that button, when i moved it out of that div, the problem is solved
[04:31:37] <T13|needsCoffee> There are some from jQuery itself usually.
[04:31:46] <Syrit> so i will change the code, to keep that button , thank you guys
[04:31:51] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: not from w3c validate
[04:32:07] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: the validator don't care about js
[04:32:20] <Cork> T13|needsCoffee: are you thinking about jslint?
[04:32:49] <T13|needsCoffee> I was talking about error console. Sorrt
[04:33:06] <Cork> the error console won't give you info about invalid/broken html
[04:34:14] <Syrit> the reason was, i am using div.empty(); based on select change,
[04:37:47] <Syrit> Thank you so much Cork and T13|needsCoffee
[04:39:11] <jop008> how to check in a from on a max value
[04:39:28] <jop008> <inpu max= would be nice
[04:40:03] <T13|needsCoffee> Max is not supported by all browsers.
[04:40:54] <T13|needsCoffee> You could add an onKeyUp and call a function to test it though
[04:43:45] <aleray> hi, I'm looking for a simple "bubble" tooltip plugin that can take a function to set the inner html content
[04:48:32] <Flavier> QUnit someone?
[04:54:50] <jop008> How to ensure user typed in <=10 on a numeric input field?
[04:58:32] <xec> jop008: <input type="number" min="10"> :)
[05:04:22] <xec> err max="10"
[05:07:51] <jop008> and when is it checked?
[05:09:04] <jop008> I gave <label for="max_depth">Maximale diepte (meter):</label><input id='max_depth' name="max_depth" max="10" type="number" value="2">
[05:09:14] <jop008> and fill in 12 nothing is happening
[05:10:35] <jop008> xec: when is the max value used
[05:11:09] <jop008> Now I can fill in 12 when the field has a max of 10
[05:11:09] <xec> solid question
[05:11:12] <jop008> druing submit?
[05:11:21] <xec> i was just using the spinner
[05:11:26] <xec> i.e. the up and down arrows
[05:18:23] <xec> jop008: but yes
[05:18:35] <xec> jop008: it won't submit http://jsfiddle.net/dw9Kg/
[05:18:54] <jop008> okay clear no messages for the user?
[05:19:24] <xec> the message says "can't be larger than 10" here
[05:19:44] <xec> and you can style it using ":invalid {...}" in css
[05:19:55] <xec> the downside is browser support, of course
[05:20:23] <xec> "it" being the invalid input, not the message box
[05:23:46] <xec> firefox doesn't appear to care too much... there are probably a lot of shims for this though
[05:38:05] <Syrit> i have div with a class "hide" and i then i am using .slideDown()  , but it won't work .
[05:38:21] <Syrit> should i use display non instead ?
[05:38:55] <Syrit> in other words, will a class hide prevent slideDown from working ?
[05:40:01] <shoky> Syrit: if you have  display:none for .hide in your css then that's fine
[05:40:33] <Syrit> i did not change the css shoky
[05:40:35] <beaky> hello
[05:40:41] <beaky> is it bad to link to code.jquery.com jquery
[05:40:44] <beaky> or should I supply my own jquery
[05:41:24] <shoky> Syrit: i don't know what you had in your css to begin with. slideDown() needs the element to be display:none. doesn't matter how you make it have display:none
[05:41:38] <Syrit> i see
[05:42:01] <Syrit> thanks shoky
[05:44:00] <beaky>     $('#out').text($('#example').value); why my code not work
[05:44:22] <Cork> ?api val
[05:44:32] <Cork> damn...
[05:44:45] <beaky> $('#api').print()
[05:44:45] <Cork> beaky: use val() instead of .value
[05:44:48] <beaky> oh
[05:44:49] <beaky> ah thanks
[05:46:37] <beaky> how do I bind the value ofa  select on to a text
[05:46:45] <beaky> even when it not changed yet
[05:47:26] <Cork> $('select option:selected').text();
[05:47:39] <beaky> ah
[05:47:55] <beaky> i tried it with the change event listener
[05:48:03] <beaky> but it only wokrs on change
[05:50:06] <Syrit> well, when i am calling slideDown() it's not removing the .hide class ! what should i do to get around this ?
[05:51:01] <Cork> Syrit: you would have to use the callback
[05:51:11] <Cork> and do $(this).removeClass('hide')
[05:51:20] <Syrit> :/
[05:51:32] <Cork> or run .hide() on page load
[05:51:34] <Syrit> i thought that jQuery is smart enough to do such things for me :D
[05:51:39] <Cork> and not have display: none; on .hide
[05:51:51] <Cork> Syrit: it doesn't know about random class names no
[05:52:04] <beaky> http://jsfiddle.net/NT3tm/ how do I improve ym jquery
[05:52:39] <Taret> hello
[05:52:48] <Syrit> Cork here is my dive #fields.hide , is it wrong that  i hard coded the hide class ?
[05:53:17] <Taret> this demo doesn't work with IE 9, http://jsfiddle.net/RWSAw/29/ I get an interface not supported line 6825  jquery 1.8.3
[05:53:36] <Cork> Syrit: jquery expects you to hide those elements with .hide() on ready
[05:53:49] <Cork> Syrit: and it sets display: none inline (plus a few other things)
[05:54:21] <Syrit> oh, so i can't give this div a hard coded class ...
[05:54:23] <Cork> ugg..
[05:54:32] <Cork> Taret: don't use doucment.write >_<
[05:55:02] <jp-> pretty jsfiddle even warns you about doing it
[05:55:03] <Cork> the world has moved away from that ugly hack since the mid 90's
[05:55:05] <jp-> *pretty sure
[05:55:14] <Taret> Cork:  I don't think that is the problem
[05:55:29] <Taret> I need to generate a document with javascript,. I have to use doc.write
[05:55:42] <Cork> Taret: well it might not be THE problem, but it is A problem
[05:56:03] <Taret> Cork: I asked people countless time for an alternative, that createDOm thing doesn't work
[05:56:21] <Cork> Tarential: doc.createElement
[05:56:24] <Cork> *Taret:
[05:56:31] <Tarential> :O
[05:56:33] <Cork> Taret: or doc.body.innerHTML
[05:56:36] <Cork> Tarential: sorry
[05:56:38] <Tarential> lol np
[05:56:54] <Taret> Cork:  how do I create head and styles using body.innerHTML ?
[05:56:58] <jp-> or just using jquery, $("markup here")
[05:57:11] <Cork> Taret: you don't you do that with doc.head
[05:57:38] <Cork> Taret: anyway the base of the problem is you need to wait for onload for the open call
[05:57:47] <Cork> Taret: your trying to use the document when it doesn't exist
[05:58:12] <Taret> Cork: how come it works on other browsers? I have tried to put it in document ready, document onload, anything and still doesn't work on Internet Explorer
[05:58:16] <Cork> jp-: as he is actually working with a foraging document, that isn't true actually
[05:58:45] <Cork> Taret: cause they might have gotten too many pages with this bug, so they have added a workaround for it
[05:58:51] <Cork> Taret: but it is still invalid
[05:58:54] <Syrit> Cork i found a similar problem on StackOver flow, here is my bootstrap .hide class ".hide {
[05:58:54] <Syrit>   display: none !important;
[05:58:54] <Syrit> }"
[05:59:08] <Syrit> they suggested to delete the !important and it will solve the problem 1
[05:59:10] <Cork> Syrit: ugg...
[05:59:14] <Taret> Cork: I added body onload from within the document, nothing changes
[05:59:23] <Cork> Syrit: i would suggest not using .hide at all actually
[06:00:03] <Syrit> what to use instead (away from using jQuery to hide it on page loade ) ! because the div will be always hidden, i don't feel good writing a code to write it !
[06:00:07] <Syrit> hide*
[06:01:50] <Taret> Cork: why is it invalid?
[06:02:01] <Cork> Taret: was looking into it
[06:02:03] <Cork> and no it isn't
[06:02:21] <Taret> I like to believe that IE is a bad browser personally
[06:02:22] <Cork> Taret: window.open is old enough to be from the time when they did hacks to handle asyncness
[06:02:37] <Taret> Cork: if there was an alternative I would gladly use it
[06:02:41] <Cork> Taret: well window.open is normally a bad choice of ui
[06:02:50] <Cork> Taret: load an html file
[06:02:52] <beaky> what should i know abotu using jquery on mobile
[06:02:53] <Taret> Cork: I only do what is asked of me ...
[06:02:54] <beaky> is it good idea?
[06:02:56] <Cork> and have it do what you want internally
[06:03:11] <Taret> will it still be able to call data from window.opener ?
[06:03:15] <Cork> yes
[06:03:19] <Taret> really?
[06:03:26] <Cork> window.open is what makes that reference
[06:03:50] <Taret> ok I may try that later, nothing to lose I guess
[06:03:55] <Cork> so i would have a static html file with the js it needs
[06:04:05] <Cork> and a function in it's global scope
[06:04:33] <Taret> all I need to do is pass the window to the parent actually, the window.opener has all the data and functions
[06:04:44] <Cork> fine then
[06:05:00] <Cork> just have all the js in the second html file
[06:05:03] <Cork> and it should just work then
[06:05:03] <Taret> what if it doesn't work then as well? what do I do next?
[06:05:27] <Taret> Cork: the problem is I have multiple charts on a main page and I need a preview button for each, and thee data is in a varaible on the main page
[06:05:38] <Cork> Taret: your working cross documents right now
[06:05:43] <Cork> and that is problematic
[06:05:54] <Cork> especially as jquery holds onto the document it was loaded on
[06:05:59] <Taret> hm
[06:06:17] <Taret> but it works on Firefox and Opera and Chrome , well after some fiddling
[06:06:40] <Cork> Taret: i would still say the result is ugly
[06:06:47] <Cork> "it works" is not enough for me
[06:06:58] <Cork> it should be manageable too
[06:07:03] <Taret> well I need stuff to work, nobody cares if my code is beautiful or correct arround here
[06:07:09] <Cork> and the best way to do that is to no have all your html in js files...
[06:07:25] <Taret> my html in js files? O.o
[06:07:28] <Cork> Taret: until they want to to update it and it take 3 times as long
[06:07:44] <Cork> Taret: yes the doc.write("your html is here instead of in a html file")
[06:07:55] <Cork> s/in a/in an/
[06:08:23] <Taret> I am sorry I have no idea what that sed? syntax means, s/ means replace?
[06:08:47] <Cork> Taret: just ignore it, it's not important
[06:10:08] <Taret> javascript makes me depressed
[06:10:12] <sahbeewah> "sed" ... not sure if clever pun or...
[06:10:14] <Taret> I never used a language before that made me sad
[06:10:25] <Taret> sahbeewah: not clever pun
[06:10:32] <Taret> sahbeewah: sorry to dissapoint you
[06:10:35] <Cork> Taret: well your using a format that is close to 20 years old
[06:10:49] <Taret> I didn't find any other way to do it
[06:11:04] <Cork> Taret: i suspect if you use a format that's been depricated for over 15 years it will be depressing
[06:11:14] <Cork> Taret: like php 0.001 or something like that
[06:11:25] <Taret> php is a bad language
[06:11:31] <Taret> and so is javascript
[06:11:45] <xec> lol sahbeewah, i was certain it was a pun
[06:11:46] <Cork> Taret: this isn't exactly javascript
[06:11:54] <Cork> Taret: this is dom and dom manipulation
[06:12:05] <Cork> and your using features from dom0 (pre dom standards)
[06:12:10] <xec> you're
[06:12:10] <Cork> we are up to dom4 now
[06:12:28] <Taret> what feautures exactly did I use? getElementById ?
[06:12:32] * xec hugs Cork
[06:12:47] <Cork> Taret: document.write, window.open to name two
[06:13:10] <Taret> ok, what should I use instead then? to generate html dynamically in a new window?
[06:13:25] <Taret> is there an alternative to window.open?
[06:13:49] <T13|needsCoffee> window.close()
[06:13:51] <T13|needsCoffee> ??
[06:13:53] <Cork> Taret: the popup you create is in quirks mode
[06:13:54] <Cork> and so on
[06:14:07] <Taret> when I press f12 under IE it's not
[06:14:10] <Cork> Taret: have a static html file
[06:14:17] <Cork> when you want to show the dialog
[06:14:17] <Taret> but I still need to do window.open
[06:14:27] <Cork> call open with a reference to this resource
[06:14:29] <Syrit> what should i be using to hide the div without jquery ? and avoidng .hide class ?
[06:14:35] <Cork> and have the page do it's job it self
[06:14:48] <Cork> instead of loading about:blank, and after the fact inject all the html it should have
[06:15:15] <Cork> Syrit: $('selector-to-match-the-elements').hide()
[06:15:21] <Cork> Syrit: run it in .ready()
[06:15:23] <Taret> Cork: the problem is I have to manipulate content in the html file stiff, change the contents of a paragraph for example
[06:15:37] <Cork> Tarential: so do that after it has been loaded
[06:15:45] <Cork> damn...
[06:15:47] <Cork> *Taret:
[06:16:05] <Tarential> lol
[06:16:08] <Syrit> Cork i understand the idea, but as i told you , the div will be really hidden all the time, so is it conisdered a normal practice to write code for hiding a div that is always hidden by default ?
[06:16:35] <Cork> Syrit: if you plan to do slideDown, it isn't going to be hidden all the time :)
[06:16:48] <Taret> Cork: do I do it from inside the page? or outside?
[06:16:49] <Syrit> oh yes, i meant to say, hidden by default
[06:16:53] <Cork> Syrit: and for slideDown to work reliably yes you need to use .hide()
[06:17:01] <Cork> Taret: either way works
[06:17:23] <Cork> Syrit: jquery is meant to be unobstructive
[06:17:25] <Taret> Cork: I don't understand why this would make a difference, it sounds the same way, after you have the page that is
[06:17:39] <Cork> Syrit: that you should be able to load the page without js, and still see the info you need
[06:17:41] <Syrit> so, i simply can't use .hide css class :D
[06:17:52] <Cork> Syrit: and then on ready you hide the things you want to "enhance"
[06:18:03] <Cork> and then you do the things you want with js
[06:18:24] <Cork> Syrit: ready triggers before the page draws, so it is safe to do it there
[06:18:57] <Cork> and as long as the selector is fairly simple, it should never ever be a problem
[06:19:45] <Cork> something like $('.description').hide();  $('.description').eq(0).slideDown(300);
[06:20:04] <Syrit> i am really still not convinced that i should write code to hide a div that will be hidden on page load by default ! :D Cork, so i think i am going to be chaining (#)
[06:20:21] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/1/edit -- does anybody know how to replace the default jQuery Mobile loader with NProgress (http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/)?
[06:20:30] <Syrit> (#div).removeClass('hide').slideDown Cork
[06:20:32] <Cork> Syrit: well you find it better that visitors without js, can't read the info?
[06:20:42] <boytoy_> Also, what do you guys think of NProgress in general?
[06:20:53] <Syrit> i don't want an visitors without js :D
[06:21:14] <Cork> Syrit: and you don't think they should be the ones to decide that?
[06:21:29] <Cork> Syrit: it is simple small things to make that possible
[06:21:39] <Cork> so there isn't really an excuse to not do it
[06:21:56] <Syrit> i understand the idea, but it really sounds so strange to me Cork !
[06:22:04] <Cork> Syrit: why?
[06:22:28] <Syrit> i told you , my main idea, is that , the div is hidden by default, why would i have to write code to hide it !
[06:22:33] <Cork> Syrit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
[06:22:35] <Syrit> why not simply have .hide calass
[06:22:52] <Cork> Syrit: cause you have info you plan to show through js
[06:23:01] <Chuck> hi all
[06:23:07] <Cork> and if js is meant to show/hide it
[06:23:12] <Cork> then js should do just that
[06:23:22] <Syrit> i see your point now
[06:23:48] <Cork> Syrit: to force the user to use js just so js can do removeClass('hide') is what's silly if you ask me
[06:24:00] <Chuck> for some reason I can't get blur to work for the life of me, the only time I got it to use my function is when I did an inline onfocus
[06:24:25] <Chuck> but the problem is it's a dropdown, so everytime you select the dropdown it would just run the function so you couldn't choose from the drop down
[06:24:42] <Chuck> I have a lot of .change(function() and those all work
[06:24:52] <Syrit> i understand Cork, but ithough that it's really more simple to have .hide class, then just remove it when i need or have too
[06:24:56] <Chuck> tried to do this element the same way, nothing
[06:24:59] <Chuck> so lost
[06:24:59] <Velveeta> chuck: what are you trying to have happen on focus and blur?
[06:25:09] <Cork> Syrit: it is, it is also broken
[06:25:30] <Chuck> I have 2 dropdowns, on document.ready it replaces the dropdown with a type to search and autoatically populates the options
[06:25:31] <Syrit> got it
[06:25:48] <thaifood> hi peeps
[06:25:50] <Chuck> now when they select from that first one, the second one will populate only options that relate to the first
[06:26:02] <Chuck> i have that set to a function called contactLoad()
[06:26:11] <Syrit> thank you so much Cork for being pateint with me :)
[06:26:18] <Velveeta> ok, so what are you trying to have actually happen on blur?
[06:26:32] <Chuck> I've tried $("#advertiser").blur(function()  tried .on("blur", etc
[06:26:41] <Chuck> just want it to run the function contactLoad() on blur
[06:26:50] <thaifood> What's the easiest way to upload a file using jQuery and PHP please ?
[06:26:53] <Velveeta> why on blur instead of on change? just out of curiosity
[06:27:01] <Chuck> the only time i get it to  work is if i make the div it lives in, tabindex=1 and put onblur inline on the div
[06:27:07] <Chuck> i've tried change
[06:27:09] <Chuck> doesn't work
[06:27:20] <Velveeta> thai: the *easiest* way is to do a standard form and a file element
[06:27:32] <Chuck> well not sure if i did the inline onchange, lemme try
[06:27:36] <Velveeta> chuck: do you have an example out there somewhere? code bin or jsfiddle or something?
[06:28:01] <Velveeta> it shouldn't matter if it's inline or bound via jquery, if it works, it'll work both ways, if it doesn't, it won't work either way
[06:28:51] <djangonoob> hi, can you tell me a good fluid carousel plugin for <li>'s with custom content (every elem has the same content) with can add and remove elems
[06:29:39] <Chuck> ok forgive my messy code
[06:29:39] <Chuck> http://pastebin.com/mzh5rw5R
[06:29:43] <djangonoob> it has not to be a carousel but I want to have something like that with prev and next buttons
[06:29:48] <Chuck> do a find and type advertiser data
[06:30:52] <Chuck> i have all kinds of things going on when dropdowns change their values, i feel it has to deal with this dynamic dropdown, only thing that's different then the rest
[06:30:59] <Chuck> cause the rest dropdowns work with .change()
[06:32:05] <Velveeta> so one thing i see here is this is your contactLoad function: url += "&query={60.CT." + advertiser.value + "}";
[06:32:13] <Velveeta> where is advertiser being declared?
[06:32:31] <Chuck> advertiser is the ID of my select field
[06:32:34] <Syrit> Mr. Patience Cork , what is considered better ? element.hide() or element.addClass("hide") : ?
[06:33:00] <Velveeta> right, but you're referencing it there as a variable
[06:33:06] <Velveeta> so you have to have that variable declared somewhere
[06:33:13] <Chuck> nope
[06:33:20] <Chuck> it's the value of the element
[06:33:20] <Velveeta> that's probably part of your problem
[06:33:25] <Chuck> why? that works fine
[06:33:33] <Chuck> if I select an option from the advertiser
[06:33:34] <Velveeta> i don't see how...
[06:33:42] <Chuck> then in console type advertiser.value, it returns the value of that field
[06:34:11] <Velveeta> so everywhere else that you're referencing that drop down, you're doing it as $('#advertiser')
[06:34:15] <Chuck> if I manually execute contactLoad() the options in the dropdown are correct
[06:34:19] <Chuck> yes
[06:34:26] <Velveeta> but in this one place, you're doing advertiser.value instead of $('#advertiser').val()
[06:34:42] <Chuck> yes
[06:34:43] <Velveeta> and you're saying that without declaring a variable named advertiser, it's allowing you to reference advertiser.value?
[06:34:45] <Chuck> give it a shot
[06:34:56] <Velveeta> i can't give it a shot, you haven't given me a working demo..
[06:35:01] <Chuck> sec i'll do a jsfiddle
[06:35:04] <Velveeta> ok
[06:51:56] <cff> Does anyone know a jQuery/jQuery UI data table plugin with read/write capabilities?
[06:52:15] <cff> that is also free as in beer
[06:52:33] <cff> similar to http://editor.datatables.net/
[06:53:50] <Chuck> ok now im confused so yeah, first, typing the ID of the element didn't come back with anything
[06:54:19] <Chuck> then I loaded a couple of the jquery files from my app to jsfiddle and it started to say undefined when i typed the ID of the element
[06:54:44] <Chuck> http://jsfiddle.net/XJWuG/
[06:54:50] <Chuck> so if you go to console you can type advertiser
[06:54:56] <Cork> Syrit: that depends on if you want to use .slideDown/slideUp and company
[06:55:05] <Cork> Syrit: those expect that you use .hide()
[06:55:06] <Chuck> and it will say undefined, without the JS files attached it won't do that
[06:55:18] <Chuck> but on my app, when I type advertiser, i get the code of the input field
[06:55:20] <Syrit> yes, i got it Cork ,
[06:55:24] <Velveeta> yeah i get ReferenceError: advertiser is not defined
[06:55:34] <Chuck> event .va() is coming back null
[06:55:35] <Velveeta> so somewhere, it's defining a variable called advertiser
[06:55:37] <Chuck> even*
[06:55:39] <LoneSoldier728> what is used to test javascript code?
[06:55:49] <LoneSoldier728> what is a popular unit test
[06:55:53] <Chuck> but what I don't understand though, every input field acts this way
[06:55:55] <Velveeta> because you can't just reference a node by id and have it return the node, you have to run that id through a function like getElementById
[06:56:11] <Chuck> are you familiar with quickbase?
[06:56:15] <Velveeta> nope
[06:56:22] <Velveeta> well, the thing i'm thinking is that wherever 'advertiser' is being defined as a variable, it's pointing to the first instance of advertiser
[06:56:25] <Chuck> ok, was gonna say maybe it has to do with the quickbaseclient.js
[06:56:36] <Velveeta> but in your javascript, you're doing a .replaceWith on your advertiser node
[06:56:51] <Velveeta> which scraps the original instance of it and creates a new one, which advertiser the variable would no longer reference
[06:56:52] <Chuck> yeah
[06:57:04] <Chuck> oh i see what you mea
[06:57:05] <Chuck> n
[06:57:07] <overtime> #j mm
[06:57:25] <Chuck> but if the variable is no longer referenced how am i able to call it via advertiser.value
[06:57:52] <Chuck> sorry im not really that good at jquery and javascript
[06:57:55] <Velveeta> because javascript garbage collection won't reclaim that memory space if there's still a reference to it
[06:57:56] <Chuck> so forgive my ignorance
[06:58:02] <Velveeta> and your variable is that reference, so it's still in memory
[06:58:06] <Chuck> ahh
[06:58:07] <Velveeta> it's just not in your document
[06:58:23] <Velveeta> what you might want to try doing, rather than replaceWith
[06:58:24] <Chuck> so it can see it's values but not any of it's events?
[06:58:26] <Velveeta> is something like .empty()
[06:58:33] <Velveeta> and then just re-add your new options
[06:58:43] <Chuck> so keep everything else like the .append()?
[06:58:53] <Chuck> just change the replaceWith to empty?
[06:59:01] <Velveeta> yeah, though you should also assemble that option list in a variable and append it all at once
[06:59:04] <Chuck> which what just dumps it's options
[06:59:08] <Velveeta> right
[06:59:48] <Chuck> like put the <option value = + ID + etc into some var like, options
[06:59:56] <Chuck> then do append("options") or something?
[07:00:46] <Velveeta> append(options)
[07:00:48] <Velveeta> yeah
[07:00:55] <Chuck> ok
[07:01:01] <Velveeta> each time you do an append to the document, it causes reflow in the layout, which is an expensive process
[07:01:23] <Velveeta> so if you're iterating over some constructed html, you cause reflow for every append, vs making 1 long string of it and appending it at 1 time
[07:02:27] <_rgn> Velveeta: surely you can append multiple times as long as the element appended to is not in the dom
[07:02:44] <LoneSoldier728> is QUnit mainly used or mocha or
[07:03:16] <Velveeta> rgn: sure, if you're appending to a document fragment
[07:05:41] <Krinkle> LoneSoldier728: QUnit
[07:06:06] <Chuck> so what do you think would go through and declare every element id and/or name a variable?
[07:06:39] <LoneSoldier728> thanks krinkle
[07:19:15] <Velveeta> chuck: depending on your back end, there may be some auto generated javascript that creates those kinds of references
[07:24:41] <scotteg> Hello everyone. admittedly, jquery is not my forte, so I'm hoping someone here can help me out. I am triggering events on button clicks (e.g., unhide a spinner, change the text of buttons, etc…glad to provide some code). Simple. Works great in all browsers except OS X Safari. In OS X Safari, these triggered animations do not display. Well, not exactly. If I breakpoint on them, they do actually trigger, but then something is stopping t
[07:24:42] <scotteg> Stepping through I see some event handling is taking place, but I'm not exactly sure what is going on.
[07:25:50] <Chuck> Thanks for your help Velveeta
[07:26:21] <Velveeta> chuck: no problem, did that seem to help fix the problem?
[07:27:29] <thaifood> What's the easiest way to upload a file using jQuery and PHP please ?
[07:28:02] <NoiseEee> thaifood: a form.
[07:28:21] <myosotis> and move_uploaded_file
[07:28:25] <thaifood> go on
[07:28:37] <thaifood> where does the file go when i submit a form
[07:28:47] <myosotis> it goes to a temporary directory
[07:28:52] <Chuck> not sure yet, i'm trying your suggestion now
[07:28:59] <myosotis> you have to examine the $_FILES array in PHP and move it to where you want
[07:29:01] <NoiseEee> thaifood: these are things you should google.
[07:29:16] <thaifood> i've been googling.  this is my current form   http://fpaste.org/40470/95145401/
[07:29:42] <myosotis> thaifood, add the proper enctype to your form
[07:29:57] <NoiseEee> thaifood: http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.post-method.php and ##php please.
[07:30:34] <thaifood> ok thanks, so i need   enctype="multipart/form-data"   even for a single file ?
[07:31:19] <NoiseEee> thaifood: you do
[07:31:27] <thaifood> I appreciate the help.
[07:32:36] <scotteg> Anyone?
[07:33:17] <NoiseEee> scotteg: can't really help aside from http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 or if you create a jsfiddle
[07:34:03] <scotteg> http://pastebin.com/9LHaWrTp
[07:34:05] <krambiorix> hi, i have numbers like 1, 10 , 101, 1010, 1020, 102, 103, 1030  in an array. I want to create a visual hiarchy  from them ... 10 goes below 1, 101 below 10, 1010 below 101,  1030 below 10.... How can i do that?
[07:34:25] <scotteg> NoiseEee: just put up a link
[07:35:18] <Chuck> hmm still no luck
[07:35:21] <scotteg> These click triggers are working fine in all browsers (even iOS Safari), and do actually get called in OS X Safari, too, but then something is stopping them.
[07:35:23] <NoiseEee> scotteg: well, for one, live() is deprecated but thats not your issue i'd imagine
[07:35:28] <NoiseEee> !jsfiddle
[07:35:31] <NoiseEee> !code
[07:35:33] <NoiseEee> !someThing
[07:35:50] <NoiseEee> scotteg: recreate the issue at jsfiddle.com so we can all see/help etc
[07:36:04] <Velveeta> krambiorix: i'd probably use an object map and a recursive function to examine N number of characters of each of those numbers and slot them into different places in the object hierarchy
[07:36:16] <scotteg> Right, but for some reason, on doesn't work for that particular trigger (perhaps b/c I'm using a class prefix search as the selector/)
[07:36:36] <scotteg> Ok, will do, thanks
[07:36:41] <Velveeta> on should work everywhere live used to
[07:37:10] <krambiorix> Velveeta, any (pseudo) code to share?
[07:37:32] <Velveeta> krambiorix: not off the top of my head, that was just a high-level overview of how i'd probably tackle it
[07:37:56] <krambiorix> Velveeta, ok thanks !
[07:39:34] <Distraught> hello i want to load a php file inside the tags that autocomplete is using
[07:39:37] <Distraught> can someone help me?
[07:40:26] <codepython777> I'm looking to take a bunch of text elements and animate them inside a rectangle. Whats the easiest way to create this? Any particular framework/widget recommendations?
[07:48:21] <clime> Is there a builtin method how to add to every ajax request some get parameter?
[07:49:27] <M3kH> why don't build a function like getUrl("url"); and add over there the additional parameters?
[07:54:02] <clime> M3kH: I don't want to modify plugins I use to use that
[07:54:11] <clime> *to do that
[07:58:02] <M3kH> I don't think you can handle event on all ajax request, but try with $( document ).ajaxStart(function() { and see what you get in $(this)
[07:58:33] <M3kH> if you are testing right now, tell me what is the result I'm quite curios
[07:59:05] <scotteg> NoiseEee: well, after creating a jsfiddle to recreate the issue, the issue doesn't occur with just the relevant portions of the code. So I'm wondering if it's a framework issue
[07:59:44] <LoneSoldier728> i have this question when do u optimize code .... is the answer when you put it out to production and while writing it ?
[08:00:10] <RRR2> people sometimes complain about pre-optimizing the code
[08:00:18] <RRR2> is because they aren't smart enough to get it
[08:00:23] <RRR2> I'm jk
[08:00:32] <RRR2> Just comment on optimized code I guess.
[08:00:43] <clime> M3kH: I have discovered this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jquery-dev/OBcEfgvTJ9I   so I'll probably try to use some of the solutions there, they mention that ajaxStart does not lead to solution
[08:01:13] <LoneSoldier728> im a noobie RRR2
[08:01:22] <LoneSoldier728> what is optimized code like taking out whitespaces
[08:01:23] <LoneSoldier728> etc?
[08:01:28] <Velveeta> clime: ajaxSetup i believe
[08:01:31] <RRR2> no
[08:01:34] <M3kH> clime: ok I took the only one doesn't do the job :D
[08:01:35] <RRR2> That's not optimized code
[08:01:41] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[08:01:45] <RRR2> That is compressed/minified code
[08:02:01] <RRR2> optimizing code is making slow code, be fast
[08:02:04] <clime> Velveeta: does not help If you have specified data in your ajax call afaik
[08:02:07] <NoiseEee> scotteg: i'd go through that debugging link on how to to search for more cluez
[08:02:15] <LoneSoldier728> is there a quick example of something simple?
[08:02:21] <RRR2> you need to know a few things about memory usage, processor usage, take into account lots of stuff
[08:02:22] <clime> Velveeta: that is what I have read at least
[08:02:37] <RRR2> Well, optimizing code is doing simple stuff to make a big change
[08:02:53] <RRR2> Google "optimizing" JavaScript
[08:02:59] <Velveeta> clime: right, but you can use it to set a beforeSend option that can augment your options
[08:03:08] <LoneSoldier728> kk
[08:03:13] <scotteg> NoiseEee: which link?
[08:03:28] <seutje> somewhat ot: something is calling Array.prototype.map in the scope of the window object on IE8... how do I figure out what is calling it?
[08:03:28] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ check the beforeSend option
[08:03:30] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ scotteg
[08:03:41] <scotteg> Ah, ok, thanks!
[08:06:05] <Velveeta> seutje: you can override the array.prototype.map function, then call through to the original version to hand off the arguments up the chain to it, and do a check for if (this === window) { console.trace(); }
[08:06:11] <Velveeta> so it'd be something like this:
[08:06:25] <seutje> oh, u can just console.trace in IE8?
[08:06:29] <seutje> sweet
[08:06:37] <scotteg> NoiseEee: Looking that over now. I am using Firebug, and not getting any errors. And I should add, this actually does sometimes work in Safari…very rarely, but it does. So it seems to be a timing issue or something.
[08:06:48] <Velveeta> var _map = Array.prototype.map; Array.prototype.map = function () { if (this === window) { console.trace(); } _map.apply(this, arguments); }
[08:06:51] <clime> Velveeta: have checked but I don't know where to get the default options and where get the the resulting data to augment.
[08:08:08] <NoiseEee> scotteg: you should change your .live call to use on(), like this:  $(someParentElementOfTheIconsThatWillAlwaysBeThere).on('click','[class^=icon-]',function() { //etc })
[08:08:23] <fuzzyhorns> in firefox clicking a drop down menu is having no effect, and i get this warning: Empty string passed to getElementById()
[08:08:37] <scotteg> Ok, I'll do that. Do you think that could actually be causing or contributing to the problem?
[08:08:44] <fuzzyhorns> I'm a rails person not a js person, can anyone give me a hint? : /
[08:08:52] <Velveeta> clime: here you go: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4527054/is-it-possible-to-modify-xmlhttprequest-data-from-beforesend-callback
[08:08:56] <ajpiano> Velveeta: btw, thanks for hanging out here since #jqcon, your helpfulness does not go unnoticed :)
[08:09:14] <Velveeta> ajpiano: no problem, i've enjoyed it, and it keeps my skills sharp :)
[08:09:35] <Velveeta> and i'm a lot more confident on here than on stage ;)
[08:09:40] <ajpiano> :D
[08:09:42] <ajpiano> awesome!
[08:09:48] <ajpiano> you weren't too shabby there either :)
[08:10:02] <NoiseEee> scotteg: iirc safari doesn't really like .live so much
[08:10:05] <Velveeta> good to hear, because i sounded like a train wreck to myself :D
[08:10:13] <scotteg> Ahh
[08:11:41] <seutje> Velveeta: no trace method on console object in IE8, it seems :(
[08:11:54] <Velveeta> lovely :D
[08:11:57] <Velveeta> ok let's see here.....
[08:12:09] <rabx> I am trying to use .setAttribute when and if a cookie has been set. I see that my cookie is set when clicking my cookie link through firebug and through the alert function. Problem is my .setAttribute doesn't seem to be working: http://jsfiddle.net/NQdPN/
[08:12:17] <Velveeta> oh, try just dropping a debugger; statement there
[08:12:25] <Velveeta> and then in IE8 you can step back through the call stack manually
[08:12:34] <Mac_Weber_> creating a widget like this   $.widget( "ui.myWidget", { /*code*/}    how to pass some argumentes to the widget when binding it to an element?
[08:12:40] <clime> Velveeta: so I don't need that deafult values in ajaxSetup and I can do just: $.ajax({  beforeSend: function(xhr, s) {  s.data += "&ajax=1;   } });     It is a bit strange that it is a string, otherwise it looks simple
[08:13:30] <Velveeta> clime: yeah it's a little weird that it comes through as a string… if you only need to modify it on 1 ajax request, you can just pass beforeSend as an option on the ajax request in question (but then you could just pass your extra field in your data in that same request)
[08:14:02] <Velveeta> if you want to modify all requests to have that extra parameter, you'd want to use $.ajaxSetup({beforeJson: function (xhr, s) { /* set your parameter here */ }});
[08:14:20] <Velveeta> that'll apply the beforejson property to *all* ajax requests, unless you override it on a per-request basis
[08:14:40] <clime> Velveeta: it is for all the ajax request, I think that stack overflow post is outdated because in current docs they say that settings is PlainObject
[08:15:31] <clime> Velvetta, but that is ok, ill just try to augment that object
[08:15:33] <Velveeta> yeah that SO link probably is outdated, your best bet will be to look in your copy of jquery, and search it for beforesend, to see how it's firing that callback
[08:16:12] <clime> Velvetta: to do it in beforeSend seems to me more intuitive then beforeJson, ill try these options and let you know
[08:18:33] <scotteg> NoiseEee: I made that change. Did not resolve the issue. The triggers are firing…it's that something…something…is stopping them (only in OS X Safari). When I breakpoint on any of these triggers and step through, the animations display (e.g., spinner). And as I continue to step through, they continue to be displayed, until the last step and then they disappear because the next page loads. In other words, stepping through them it wo
[08:18:34] <scotteg> fine. But when I clear the breakpoints, the effects of those triggers are not displayed.
[08:21:59] <seutje> Velveeta: wtf... arguments.caller[0] shows me a string o.O
[08:22:17] <seutje> when did strings start calling array methods? o.O
[08:22:32] <Velveeta> don't look at caller, go to your call stack tab
[08:22:40] <Velveeta> you should have an actual stack that you can go back through
[08:25:00] <ShackJack> Hi all - I am having an issue with a simple-ish jquery script that does some cloning then sorting of event divs.  It works great in Chrome but not in Firefox.. Using mostly jQuery methods throughout so not suer what gives? Could someone take a look?  http://jsbin.com/AzudoR/1/edit
[08:25:27] <clime> Velveeta: the stack overlfow post does really not work. s.data is just undefined there. I am not sure that beforeJson exists xD I haven't found it at least
[08:25:43] <Tumulte> hey, I"m trying to get a part of a page via ajax... and got nothing : http://paste.debian.net/42396/
[08:25:48] <Velveeta> clime: what version of jquery are you on?
[08:25:59] <clime> 1.9.2
[08:26:37] <Velveeta> ok let me take a look, i'm pretty sure i'm on the exact same version
[08:26:42] <clime> Velveeta: 1.9.1 sry
[08:26:47] <Velveeta> ok
[08:28:13] <seutje> heh, the callstack ends at jQuery's eventHandle function o.O
[08:28:35] <Velveeta> clime: if ( s.beforeSend && ( s.beforeSend.call( callbackContext, jqXHR, s ) === false || state === 2 ) ) {
[08:29:12] <Velveeta> line 7943
[08:29:47] <clime> Velveeta sry I don't see the point now?
[08:29:51] <clime> *now.
[08:30:04] <Velveeta> the point of ?
[08:30:34] <clime> Velveeta: the point of the line you have posted. What should it tell me?
[08:30:51] <Velveeta> that's where it's checking for the existence of a beforeSend function, and calling it
[08:31:12] <Velveeta> it's passing the jqXHR object itself, as well as the options object for itself as a reference
[08:31:30] <clime> ok but i was talking about this suggestion you have posted: $.ajaxSetup({beforeJson: function (xhr, s) { /* set your parameter here */ }});
[08:31:33] <Velveeta> so your 2nd parameter in your beforeSend function should be the ajax request's options, console.log it
[08:31:53] <clime> velvetta: probably it should have been beforeSend instead of beforeJson :)
[08:32:08] <Velveeta> oh whoops, yes, that's right :D
[08:32:12] <Velveeta> good catch
[08:32:46] <seutje> http://i.imgur.com/ABUR8uO.png
[08:33:02] <clime> velveeta: anyway I can't find anything useful in the settings object. data is not there :(
[08:33:24] <Velveeta> does the url itself contain the parameters?
[08:33:52] <Gooder> $("img", function()), what does the "img" mean? the <image/> tag?
[08:34:00] <Gooder> <img/>
[08:34:22] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[08:34:45] <duch_kazatel> jquery's selector engine is based around CSS syntax.
[08:34:57] <Velveeta> huzzah for simplicity!
[08:35:14] <duch_kazatel> very.  makes dom traversal stupid simple.
[08:38:19] <clime> velveetta: yes, so I guess I should probably insert it to the url  and I will to find out if ? is already there, right?
[08:38:27] <clime> *will need
[08:39:06] <duch_kazatel> Clime are you deling with url parsing?
[08:39:47] <clime> duch_kazatel: nope, with adding a GET param (ajax=1) to each ajax request
[08:40:11] <ShackJack> Will do
[08:40:48] <Velveeta> clime: yeah it looks like by the time it hits the beforeSend function, it's already parameterized the data object and appended it to the url (in the case of GET requests)
[08:42:37] <clime> duch_kazatel, Velveeta: Well I could parse and serialize the querystring itself. I have got a nice lib for that. but I guess Ill also try the solutions here:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jquery-dev/OBcEfgvTJ9I
[08:43:18] <Velveeta> i would just check for the existence of a ? in the url, and if it's there, append your param with a ? prefix, otherwise append it with an ampersand &
[08:43:27] <Velveeta> no need to parse and deserialize it
[08:43:31] <Velveeta> re*
[08:43:50] <clime> Velveeta: ok ill do it like that
[08:45:13] <Xander1> is there a way to pass a variable using jquery to a PHP session?
[08:46:28] <rdldew> So typeof is javascript. I know that jQuery has type, but I don't understand its use and how to convert the typeof statement that I have to jQuery.
[08:46:44] <rdldew> Any thoughts how to change this… if (typeof this.attr('id') === 'undefined'){…}
[08:46:48] <rdldew> to jQuery using type
[08:46:55] <ShackJack> Hi everyone - I'm having trouble with the following code http://jsbin.com/AzudoR/1/edit in FF and MSIE; where I do a date comparison to purge expired events (DIVs) it seems to be purging all of DIVS - though it looks OK in Chrome.  Any suggestions?  Not sure if should be using  new Date($.now())  vs $.now() when comparing?
[08:47:03] <Velveeta> $.type(this.attr('id')) === 'undefined'
[08:47:46] <duch_kazatel> rdldew what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[08:47:47] <rdldew> So you're saying it would be if ($.type(this.attr…. ?
[08:48:07] <Velveeta> yep, the usage is almost identical, but instead of typeof var, you say $.type(var)
[08:48:36] <rdldew> Well, my plugin has a check to see if the id is declared in the options, if it's not there, it checks if it's in the existing node, then finally it will assign a default ID.
[08:48:46] <rdldew> Cool. Thanks Velveeta
[08:48:53] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[08:50:19] <clime> Velveeta: ya, it works:), but I get ajax=1&ajax=1&ajax=1&ajax=1&ajax=1 in the url so I'll probably reserialize to avoid. Moreless cosmetic issue but I would like to have that always just once.
[08:50:56] <Velveeta> yeah i would too, not sure what's causing that, it looks like it's running the same request through multiple times, which is weird
[08:51:31] <clime> Velveeta: It happens on pagination. The link is already renderred with ajax=1 from the previous call
[08:51:42] <Velveeta> gotcha
[08:52:18] <Velveeta> still, that's weird, i would assume that every ajax request is its own instance, as opposed to it somehow modifying the url on the source node and compounding that
[08:53:44] <clime> Velveeta: well, it just how backend works, I use some django plugin to do pagination. I could remove and probably should change that behavour in backend.
[08:53:56] <clime> *could change
[08:54:06] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[08:54:22] <Velveeta> yeah, or you could parse and reserialize on the client like you'd previously suggested
[08:54:27] <Velveeta> probably the easier route
[08:55:09] <clime> ye, but it is not really guarranteed that if the previous request was ajax then the next will be also ajax xD
[08:55:26] <clime> so I guess I should avoid renderring that param
[08:55:31] <clime> at allt
[08:56:17] <clime> Velveeta: anyway, thanks for help man!
[08:56:34] <Velveeta> heheheh no problem
[08:57:06] <ShackJack> Can anyone see a problem with this comparo - where thisDate is a timestamp format (2013-09-26 10:00)   if (new Date(thisDate) >= new Date($.now()) & new Date(thisDate).getMonth() == (thisMonth - 1)) { ... }
[08:59:20] <Syrit> guys, i have 2 text fields in my form and i would like to create a new record using ajax, what comes to my mind is, that i need to 1- get .val() of each text fields, 2-serialize() , 3-jquery.ajax() , is that the right way to do so ?
[09:00:36] <Velveeta> shackjack: for one thing, you don't need to pass $.now() to the Date constructor, you can just say new Date() and it'll be the date object for 'now'
[09:00:58] <vlcn> can anyone point me in the right direction with JSONP?  http://jsfiddle.net/pBuNW/1/
[09:01:13] <vlcn> I thought I had this all set up correctly, but I'm clearly missing something
[09:01:35] <ShackJack> Gotcha - yes, thanks I was figuring that; it still doesn't work if I take it off.... Is 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm" a valid timestamp format to pass to Date?
[09:02:16] <Velveeta> not sure off the top of my head, check it in your console, create a new Date in that format, and look at the object to make sure it constructed as expected
[09:04:03] <seutje> Velveeta: holy poop, traced it to an unsafe for loop in jquery.form.js (ancient version, old drupal core...)
[09:04:23] <Velveeta> ahhhhh good to hear you got it figured out :)
[09:04:54] <seutje> also, this was in a minified file, which didn't make things easier
[09:05:01] <seutje> now to override without hacking...
[09:05:08] <Velveeta> are you in chrome?
[09:05:37] <ShackJack1> Velveeta: thanks - got disconnected, though it still doesn't work in MS of FF if I fix it; does anyone know is 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm" a valid timestamp format to pass to Date?
[09:05:56] <Velveeta> shackjack: for one thing, you don't need to pass $.now() to the Date constructor, you can just say new Date() and it'll be the date object for 'now'
[09:06:05] <Velveeta> doh, sorry, copy/pasted the wrong response :D
[09:06:12] <Velveeta> not sure off the top of my head, check it in your console, create a new Date in that format, and look at the object to make sure it constructed as expected
[09:14:00] <seutje> Velveeta: was that chrome question aimed at me?
[09:14:56] <seutje> cause this was on IE8 only, cause there the Array.prototype.map, indexOf and filter were defined, causing for loops on arrays to tweak out
[09:15:25] <seutje> oooh, u were asking if I was in chrome cause then I could use the pretty print, that is in fact what I used to turn the minified into a somewhat readable :P
[09:15:46] <seutje> anyway, that was a lovely way to spend my day q.q
[09:20:29] <grafi> oOOo
[09:46:50] <devslash> i use window.open a page as a pop up window. how can I only display the window once the page has finished loading
[09:48:36] <apexskier> devslash: $(document).ready(function() { … }) or $(window).load(function() { … })
[09:48:39] <Velveeta> are you talking about how to prevent the child page from popping up until the parent page is finished?
[09:48:44] <devslash> no
[09:48:57] <Velveeta> not making the window pop up until the page it's trying to load has finished loading?
[09:49:18] <Velveeta> if that's the case, i don't know that you can do that
[09:49:23] <devslash> parent opens child window. I want the child window to not display until it has finished loading because otherwise there are some slightly noticeable loading artifacts
[09:49:34] <devslash> yea in a nutshell
[09:49:52] <Velveeta> you could make it body { display: none; } and have a document.ready that does display: '' ?
[09:50:07] <devslash> wouldnt that display a white page
[09:50:12] <devslash> while its loading
[09:50:19] <apexskier> yes
[09:51:20] <devslash> ok thanks
[09:53:21] <on3pk> Hey guys.  I'm trying to collect data from a card reader HID.  It gives data in 2 lines, which, for the purposes of an HTML form, submits 2 different pieces of data.  Is there a way to supress the second line?
[09:53:46] <on3pk> or at least, ensure it only submits data once?  (The first line is what I'm interested in)
[09:57:20] <apexskier> var line_input = …;
[09:57:44] <apexskier> line_input = line_input.split('"\n")[0]
[09:57:54] <apexskier> * line_input = line_input.split("\n")[0]
[09:58:06] <apexskier> might help. Just turns it into the first line.
[09:59:11] <on3pk> apexskier: are there docs anywhere about line input?
[09:59:32] <apexskier> Not sure, sorry.
[09:59:45] <apexskier> and I'm afk in a minute, so good luck
[10:00:08] <on3pk> yeah, I gotta take off too, thats why I asked.
[10:00:10] <on3pk> thanks.
[10:01:24] <Velveeta> wasn't line input just a string variable up there?
[10:05:24] <boytoy_> I got if (data.thumbnail_url && data.type == 'video') -- but how do I say if data.type is 'video' or 'audio'?
[10:06:41] <boytoy_> if (data.thumbnail_url && (data.type == 'video', data.type == 'audio')) or some strange stuff like that?
[10:07:31] <Velveeta> if (data.thumbnail_url && (data.type == 'video' || data.type == 'audio'))
[10:07:47] <boytoy_> aaah sweet =)

[10:12:01] <BillCris_> ding ding dinggg
[10:12:13] <sifu_> hello folks, don't know if it is a related question but i was wondering how would i use the additional-methods in the jQuery validation plugin
[10:12:18] <BillCris_> I miss Tuco.
[10:12:47] <sifu_> i am trying to validate ukpostcode and i can see it in the additional-methods.js but kinda scratching my head as to how i could use it...
[10:12:55] <boytoy_> lolol
[10:13:48] <Velveeta> tuck was quite a character
[10:15:04] <Velveeta> tuco* grrrr colloquy autocorrect
[10:20:51] <platzhirsch> Should I rather equip my elements with identifier and directly select the elements for manipulation or if I am in a neighbored element (event etc.) just try to select it by traversing (parent, child, sibling, etc.) ?
[10:22:37] <Velveeta> depends on how much traversing you're talking about and how related the items are
[10:23:54] <platzhirsch> Velveeta: for instance I have a table of computation jobs which I can schedule per row. In each row is button to start a job and a status label. The label is in one column, the button in another one
[10:25:13] <Velveeta> i'd probably go .parent().children('.someClassName')
[10:25:22] <Velveeta> from the td
[10:25:50] <platzhirsch> Velveeta: instead of jizzing identifier all over the elements just to being able to directly select them
[10:26:29] <Velveeta> right
[10:27:07] <Velveeta> if it's something that can happen multiple times within a given page load, you might want to bind those buttons directly to the other cell they reference, as a piece of data
[10:27:17] <Velveeta> and then just get button.data('myOtherCell')
[10:27:34] <Velveeta> and then no traversing necessary, direct pointer… but you'll take a hit up front for pre-traversing to that related node
[10:27:50] <platzhirsch> okay, thanks for the input :)
[10:28:43] <Velveeta> good luck
[10:28:47] <Velveeta> and science speed!
[10:29:35] <andrew9183> anyone know of a charting plugin that will allow you to draw a line chart with a gradient color
[10:35:06] <jop008> A strange question keeping me busy for a couple of hours maybe one of you has hawk eyes.
[10:35:43] <jop008> I have two strings one is the old and the other the new one when I compare them I see differecen on console.log
[10:36:10] <jop008> the strings are built up with a looop chtml += and nothing more these are the 2 strings
[10:36:13] <jop008> new &table=rental_object&subdomain='uw%20eigen%20domein.touchingservic'&websitename='rental.touchingservices.nl/gew'&ownwebsiteurl='http://'&showemailaddress=1&showphone=0&sms_send=0&first_down_payment=20&la…&last_payment_type=1&max_persons=6&number_of_rooms=9&mumber_of_bathrooms=1 lib.js:753
[10:36:14] <jop008> old &table=rental_object&subdomain='uw%20eigen%20domein.touchingservic'&websitename='rental.touchingservices.nl/gew'&ownwebsiteurl='http://'&showemailaddress=1&showphone=0&sms_send=0&first_down_payment=20&last_payment=2&last_payment_type=1&max_persons=6&number_of_rooms=9 lib.js:754
[10:36:15] <jop008> 0 lib.js:755
[10:36:18] <jop008> sorry a bit long
[10:36:47] <jop008> if you look for &la. then you see strange things
[10:37:19] <jop008> if I do an indexof of old in the new string it reports zeo
[10:37:32] <BillCris_> jop008: Are you putting single quotes in your url?
[10:37:37] <jop008> So the strings look internally okay
[10:38:01] <jop008> not an url it is an ajax post already used before wo problems
[10:38:47] <jop008> Must I omit the quotes?
[10:39:06] <BillCris_> jop008: I've never seen get parameters quoted like that, that would add a lot of work reading and writing the variables I'd imagine.
[10:39:31] <BillCris_> jop008: could maybe fix your problem as well
[10:39:53] <jop008> So for strings quotes are not necessary
[10:40:04] <jop008> in a post string
[10:40:28] <jop008> only an encodeuri is needed am I right?
[10:40:58] <BillCris_> jop008: Yes.
[10:41:17] <jop008> Sure (I have it on several places in my code
[10:41:21] <BillCris_> foo=something&bar=anotherstring&baz=4, everything is a string coming from the URL.
[10:41:33] <jop008> alright
[10:44:24] <jop008> funny it seems better now
[10:52:15] <bakers>  /j #perl
[10:53:56] <coldhead> lol perl
[11:08:03] <beaky> when shouldn't I use jquery
[11:08:20] <beaky> everyone keeps encouraging me to learn the DOM and apply the native DOM API where possible
[11:08:37] <beaky> e.g. document.getElementById('foo') over $('#foo')
[11:08:52] <Velveeta> oh screw that
[11:09:03] <Velveeta> i mean, if you're trying to shave milliseconds or something then sure
[11:09:07] <beaky> ah
[11:09:18] <beaky> yes i find the native DOM API verbose
[11:09:38] <Velveeta> it is, now, there are times when you may want to fall back to native js functionality vs jquery
[11:09:38] <beaky> and sometimes inconcistent acros browsers
[11:09:59] <Velveeta> but usually that's when you're iterating over things in some function that forms the bowels of your application, such that it's routed through often
[11:10:16] <Velveeta> there, milliseconds can add up, so you might want to choose a more native method of iterating vs something like $.each
[11:11:11] <beaky> i thought v8 will automagically optimize everything for me, but maybe i can't depend on users running such engines
[11:12:02] <Velveeta> v8 can only optimize so far
[11:12:27] <Velveeta> something like $.each does a lot more than just iterating, it iterates, type checks, triggers callbacks, etc
[11:12:39] <Velveeta> it can't optimize that down to a simple iteration if that's all you need
[11:23:44] <trappist> I'm using twitter/typeahead.js for a user search/autocomplete field. Works fine except when I blur() the field, its contents change from the user's name to his username, and I can't figure out why.
[11:25:15] <trappist> Aaand nm I got it.
[11:30:40] <sgrover> I'm using jQuery UI's sortable.  When I move my element, I'm sometimes getting odd gaps thrown into the list.  Throws off my vertical alignments.
[11:31:18] <sgrover> Checked the googles and found a reference saying setting border-spacing to 0 would help.  It didn't.  Not sure where else to look on this.  Any tips?
[11:37:37] <sgrover> further digging shows BR tags being added to my markup when dragging.  Any idea why this may be?
[11:42:45] <AlexanderBB10> BBM (ping) availible for Android on 21 sep and for iOS6/7 on 22 sep... just saying
[11:44:01] <sgrover> k.  So my ZF Form decorators are inserting BR's after each Multicheckbox label.  Fixing Multicheckbox layout is a pain in the derriere.  So, I changed my .sortable() call slightly.  First I remove the BR's from my sortable container, then make it sortable.
[11:44:07] <sgrover> My spacing problem went away.
[11:47:33] <NoiseEee> sgrover: good work fine sir
[11:57:08] <Xander1> is it possible to set a session variable with javascript and pass it to a new opened window/tab?
[11:57:47] <Xander1> im using window.open('filename.php'); to open up a new tab
[11:59:32] <andrew9183> anyone an expert on flot? :D
[11:59:58] <Xander1> and i need to pass a variable to that new opened tab for php to use
[11:59:58] <blade_> http://geniemax.com/demo/CoreMods/list.php the filter settings to the left,  how can I make that slide up and disappear when you click on filter settings, right now it just goes up a little bit
[12:00:38] <blade_> xander1, tell me what you need i might be able to help
[12:00:55] <jedimind> holy shit, flot
[12:01:01] <jedimind> that's a library i havent heard of in ages
[12:01:47] <andrew9183> heh
[12:01:53] <andrew9183> what would you use instead?
[12:02:03] <andrew9183> highcharts prolly
[12:02:12] <blade_> http://geniemax.com/demo/CoreMods/list.php the filter settings to the left,  how can I make that slide up and disappear when you click on filter settings, right now it just goes up a little bit
[12:03:51] <ngharo> $('#additional_filter').slideUp()
[12:04:10] <blade_> ill try
[12:04:56] <Velveeta> xander1: can't you just pass it in the url to your child window as a get parameter?
[12:05:25] <blade_> ngharo thats better, but is it possible to make it so it doesn't move up but just the bottom slides up until its gone?
[12:05:35] <ngharo> blade_: remove your position: absolute
[12:07:37] <blade_> ngharo damn your a genius, seems like it was 2nd nature to you thanks bro
[12:09:20] <blade_> ngharo..last thing :s sorry, I should know this, how can I tell if its slid up or not? So I can slide it down if its up
[12:09:46] <Velveeta> .is(':hidden') should do it i think
[12:09:54] <ngharo> ^
[12:10:56] <blade_> oh thanks
[12:11:04] <blade_> I should have read what slideup does sorry
[12:28:21] <Ericx2x> hey guys i have a line of jquery that isnt working for some reason can someone tell me why?
[12:28:26] <Ericx2x> it's this line called
[12:28:27] <Ericx2x>  $(".overlay2").show();  //why doesn't these two shows work?
[12:28:31] <Ericx2x> in here
[12:28:31] <Ericx2x> http://pastebin.com/zY0CmWip
[12:28:42] <Ericx2x> sorry for the messy code
[12:29:56] <Ericx2x> line 82 doesnt want to work
[12:30:06] <Ericx2x> however if i replace that with something like an alert it works
[12:31:53] <Velveeta> are you sure they're not working? maybe they're showing but they're overlapped by some other element so you can't see them
[12:32:13] <Velveeta> because the only thing that should prevent those from actually "working" is if those nodes don't actually exist in the document
[12:32:24] <Ericx2x> Velveeta that may be it then
[12:32:32] <Ericx2x> how do i get the to appear above everything? z-index?
[12:32:50] <Ericx2x> also i thought all show does is make a display:none into a display:block
[12:33:04] <Ericx2x> because if i just change the css of those two elments to block instead of none they appear
[12:33:24] <Ericx2x> oh and they already have a high z-index
[12:33:28] <Ericx2x> so they should be appearing above everything
[12:33:43] <Velveeta> i'm not sure, that's just a guess
[12:34:01] <Velveeta> how about after they fire .show() inspect your dom and see where they appear, and at what level, and what their display property is
[12:34:42] <rdldew> Soooo I have a logic issue I'm trying to think through.
[12:34:53] <rdldew> http://demo.myradicalsolutions.com/duplicator/
[12:35:13] <Ericx2x> it's just <div class="overlay2"></div>
[12:35:16] <Ericx2x> i see no display property
[12:35:40] <rdldew> I'm trying to figure out an appropriate way to get the remove 'button' that gets duplicated to remove its parent and all children. Right now it will ultimately remove the last added node.
[12:35:42] <Velveeta> does it inherit a display: none from the overlay2 class?
[12:35:59] <Ericx2x> yea
[12:37:38] <Velveeta> rdidew: you should set that click event up as a delegated listener, and just give a click event to .removeDuplicateBtn to remove $(this).closest('.theBlueSquareClass')
[12:38:08] <Velveeta> ericx2x: i don't know what to say about that, step into the show function and see what's going wrong?
[12:38:18] <rdldew> Interesting. You're always super useful. :)
[12:39:02] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[12:59:14] <lundy> hi folks how can i insert text from a popup window into the parent form ?
[13:00:48] <r2> lundy: $(selector.parent.form).text( $(selector.popup).text() )
[13:02:22] <consumerism> say i have: var a = $('.one'); var b = $('.two'); and i want to apply $.hide() to both a and b...what's the best way to do this? my first impulse was $(a, b).hide() but of course that's not it, both a and b need to be the first argument of $(). this seems very simple but somehow the solution eludes me
[13:03:34] <consumerism> $.add()? is there a better way
[13:04:49] <grafi> .add is the way to go i think
[13:05:48] <consumerism> is there any difference between $(a).add(b).hide() and $(a).hide(); $(b).hide(); as far as performance or best practice?
[13:07:41] <grafi> probably not for your case
[13:08:00] <r2> consumerism: if a is already equal to a jquery object you should not wrapped it on the $()
[13:08:07] <NoiseEee> consumerism: always testable!
[13:08:33] <consumerism> r2: good call, thanks
[13:08:55] <r2> also the example is too small for larger stuff maybe you can save all those in an array an loop trough them and hide every one...
[13:19:55] <n0sf3rathus> hola a todos

[13:28:40] <n0sf3rathus> vale, muchas gracias de todas formas,
[13:33:28] <master> How can I have a dynamically added element acquire the styles it is supposed to have according to its class? http://jsfiddle.net/
[13:34:08] <NoiseEee> master: uhhhh the link there
[13:35:08] <master> i'm having problem when adding elements using( append/prepend/insertBefore...)
[13:35:08] <master> http://jsfiddle.net/tFhDY/
[13:35:09] <Velveeta> a dynamically added element will automatically acquire the styles it's supposed to have according to its class
[13:36:11] <codechewing> master: you don't have a <p> element on the page to find
[13:36:23] <Velveeta> your markup isn't adhering to your css
[13:36:34] <master> Velveeta: yes i'm seeing that now
[13:36:38] <Velveeta> you're specifying ptext as a direct child of blocktitlewrap, which it isn't
[13:36:51] <master> Velveeta: yup, changing that. thanks
[13:38:03] <Velveeta> no problem
[13:46:19] <beaky> why is angularjs faster than jquery
[13:46:45] <Velveeta> because it was written by googlebrains?
[13:47:27] <beaky> ah
[13:49:32] <BillCriswell> Awesome, Eric Meyers will be at the meetup I'm going to tonight.
[13:51:25] <NoiseEee> they're completely different approaches, beaky
[14:02:55] <scar> is there a substr() equivalent of php for js/jquery?
[14:03:05] <scar> oh
[14:03:14] <scar> there is! substr() haha
[14:03:17] <myosotis> yes
[14:03:46] <scar> i was googling strpos on accident
[14:03:47] <scar> lol
[14:20:28] <boytoy_> Which is better if(!$(this).length) or if($(this).length == 0)?
[14:32:18] <gnarf> boytoy_ um
[14:32:30] <gnarf> boytoy_ that will always be false
[14:32:57] <gnarf> i don't think it's possible for "this" to be undefined/null
[14:33:12] <gnarf> so there is always at least one element in the set
[14:35:32] <boytoy_> gnarf: ah yeah thats right bad example on my part
[14:35:59] <boytoy_> if(!$('.something').length) or if($('.something').length == 0) rather
[14:36:15] <gnarf> boytoy_ inside jQuery we use the first form
[14:36:21] <gnarf> !thing.length
[14:36:24] <boytoy_> sweet
[14:36:31] <gnarf> not that either is "better"
[14:36:33] <boytoy_> yeah thats the one i was rooting for
[14:36:39] <boytoy_> course not :p
[14:36:53] <gnarf> perhaps the one on the right is actually "better" because it's more declarative, but it's also more typing
[14:37:04] <Velveeta> rrrraaaaAAAAARRRR jury duty
[14:37:25] <boytoy_> hmm
[14:37:26] <gnarf> !length === (length === 0)
[14:37:57] <gnarf> they are functionally identical, assuming length must me a whole Number
[14:38:11] <gnarf> s/must me/must be
[14:38:14] <boytoy_> i do have a soft spot for the more declarative..
[14:38:16] <boytoy_> hmm
[14:39:16] <boytoy_> if($('.something').exists) also can yea?
[14:39:30] <gnarf> .length
[14:39:48] <Velveeta> yeah i don't think there's an exists function
[14:40:01] <boytoy_> i think i saw something at SO just now
[14:40:13] <gnarf> !length vs length == 0 -- "does not have length" vs "length is zero"
[14:40:45] <Velveeta> ok i'm out for a couple hours
[14:40:52] <boytoy_> Velveeta: u going to court?
[14:40:53] <boytoy_> seriously?
[14:41:03] <Velveeta> nah, i thought i had jury duty today and had forgotten
[14:41:05] <boytoy_> gnarf: nice.. im going for !length thanks man
[14:41:08] <Velveeta> turns out today was my deadline to register
[14:41:15] <boytoy_> haha oops =)
[14:41:20] <Velveeta> so i have to go in on the 14th
[14:41:36] <Velveeta> i hate having to go in for that crap… "civic duty" my ass…

[14:54:23] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I have a html document that specifies some javascript files to be loaded and I am wondering how the browser looks at those files and caches them?  I am assuming that it looks at the host and then the js filename and looks to see if that file from that host is present in the cache.  Am I close or am I way off?
[15:06:10] <clime> hey, how can I get form method (post/get) using jquery?
[15:09:09] <clime> okey, there is form.method property so my question now is, how to get the form object from jquery object xD
[15:11:32] <clime> do I need to do something like document[$form.attr('id')] or is there a more direct way?
[15:12:06] <Technical_13> Is there a way to dump an error log back to a script?
[15:12:44] <Technical_13> Like if I want to offer a report a bug on failure feature.
[15:12:56] <MobCat> is there a way to catch the element you snap to on draggable?
[15:13:53] <MobCat> droppable is lagging for me

[16:39:20] <Zak> ack, I find myself asking this question again, but what are people to deserialize/parse anything that's been $.param 'd?
[16:39:36] <Zak> i'm still surprised it's not part of jquery
[16:48:13] <Zak> ah its ok, all fixed
[16:51:03] <linagee> ack. I have this crazy formatting that's doing something after the page is loaded. :( (I can actually pause javascript and then it doesn't go all wonky.)
[16:53:09] <Zak> that's not entirely unusual to use JS to format the page
[16:53:21] <Zak> whats the problem you're trying to track down?
[16:54:00] <linagee> Zak: table width changing after pageload. :-/
[16:54:17] * linagee is in table + 33,000 lines of rendered html hell.
[16:55:11] <linagee> and I just found we've had a major timezone noting bug for the past whatever years. crazy stuff.
[16:55:52] <linagee> linagee: leave while you still can. run don't walk.
[16:57:52] <duch_kazatel> linagee hahaha nice
[17:09:25] <blindMoe|2> I ahve a table that has a few hundred rows... every 4 or 5 rows are grouped together by sharing a classname.  I want to be able to sort just those 4 or 5 rows together using .sortable().  I can get it close to working but it only wants to basically let me sort of the cells inside the row instead of the entire row
[17:09:52] <blindMoe_> has anyone tried anything like that?  Normally I would just use seperate tables for this but I don't have the option in this circumstance
[17:11:08] <blindMoe_> arg I guess I could just do $('table tr.classname').sortable()
[17:11:12] <blindMoe_> can't believe I didn't think of that until now
[17:11:46] <blindMoe_> actually $('table').sortable({ items: 'tr.classname' });
[17:15:17] <blindMoe_> arg that doesn't work because I would need to be setting multiple sortables on the same table element
[17:24:01] <blindMoe_> If anyone feels like taking a look at what I am trying to get done: http://jsfiddle.net/5Lwu9/4/   Any advice would be greatly appreciated
[17:25:28] <doug65536> blindMoe: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/5/
[17:25:42] <doug65536> fixHelper was undefined in all the calls to sortable
[17:26:40] <blindMoe_> doug65536: Try dragging one of the items in the top group around.. it will only be sortable in the bottom group and not in its own group
[17:26:54] <blindMoe_> can't seem to figure out how to get it to stay sortable in its own group and not any of the others
[17:27:10] <blindMoe_> I think it is because all the bindings are to the same element so they are somewhat overriding each other
[17:27:41] <doug65536> ok, I see what you're trying to do...
[17:29:09] <blindMoe_> doug65536: figured I could find it straight to the groups of rows using the row class but then it just makes the items inside the rows ( the td's ) sortable
[17:36:49] <doug65536> blindMoe: each call overwrites the last...
[17:37:07] <doug65536> I think you need to handle events and call cancel() when the user attempts to do something not allowed
[17:38:05] <blindMoe_> doug65536: check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/5Lwu9/6/
[17:38:25] <doug65536> great idea
[17:39:14] <blindMoe_> can't take the credit for it.. co-worker though of it
[17:39:29] <blindMoe_> way way less code int he long run as well since there were hundreds of groups before
[17:39:50] <doug65536> you should have one event handler
[17:40:36] <Velveeta> oh that is a great idea
[17:43:16] <doug65536> blindMoe: one event handler, no matter how many items http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/8/
[17:43:59] <doug65536> blindMoe: improved http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/9/
[17:44:17] <doug65536> blindMoe: uh oh
[17:44:23] <doug65536> blindMoe: mousedown is no good
[17:44:38] <doug65536> blindMoe: first drag won't work
[17:44:51] <doug65536> blindMoe: fixed http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/10/
[17:45:59] <doug65536> blindMoe_: ^
[17:46:18] <blindMoe_> nice
[17:46:23] <blindMoe_> ran into another problem with it as well
[17:46:46] <blindMoe_> serializing the data seems to be akward
[17:47:11] <doug65536> blindMoe_: sortable provides a serializer
[17:47:25] <blindMoe_> yeah it is throwing an odd error
[17:47:29] <doug65536> blindMoe_: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-serialize
[17:48:01] <blindMoe_> doug65536: yeah I am using it.. working through an issue with it
[17:48:05] <blindMoe_> think I may have it
[17:48:21] <sammych> so, anyone got something like http://www.shadowbox-js.com/ but freee?
[17:48:51] <blindMoe_> doug65536: got it: http://jsfiddle.net/5Lwu9/12/
[17:49:06] <sammych> the part I want is full image panning from shadowbox
[17:49:16] <doug65536> blindMoe_: you are still going to attach hundreds of separate handlers?
[17:49:21] <sammych> I tried rolling it into https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup/ with mouse events but I failed
[17:49:38] <blindMoe_> doug65536: just haven't adapted your code yet
[17:49:48] <doug65536> blindMoe_: oh ok :)
[17:49:54] <blindMoe_> my code only attaches one though
[17:50:04] <blindMoe_> it basically overrides the old one each time .handle is clicked
[17:50:20] <doug65536> ok, the fiddle attaches N handlers if there are N items in the table
[17:50:32] <doug65536> the one you just posted
[17:51:36] <blindMoe_> this one? http://jsfiddle.net/5Lwu9/13/
[17:51:51] <doug65536> blindMoe_: no I meant you attach tons of separate mousedown handlers
[17:51:53] <blindMoe_> remember that there is only one table so
[17:52:02] <blindMoe_> oh good point
[17:52:25] <blindMoe_> you think mousemove might fire a crapton of times?
[17:52:49] <doug65536> yes, I can suggest an optimization though
[17:52:52] <blindMoe_> http://jsfiddle.net/5Lwu9/14/
[17:53:40] <blindMoe_> why is it that in yours the mousedown even doesn't trigger on the first shot but on mine it does?  I can't see what would cause that
[17:58:39] <doug65536> blindMoe_: this should be pretty efficient http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/16/
[17:58:49] <doug65536> blindMoe_: jquery caches data elements
[17:58:52] <blindMoe_> ahh nice
[17:58:54] <doug65536> attributes*
[17:59:33] <blindMoe_> hrmm can't get anything to sort on that one
[18:00:04] <doug65536> ah
[18:00:07] <doug65536> missed something
[18:01:26] <doug65536> sfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/18/
[18:02:01] <doug65536> blindMoe_: and obviously, oops, this is what it should do http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/19/
[18:02:34] <blindMoe_> nice work
[18:02:37] <blindMoe_> like it
[18:02:41] <blindMoe_> really appreciate the help
[18:02:50] <doug65536> blindMoe_: np
[18:06:03] <doug65536> blindMoe_: with multiple tables, there's a subtle bug... this fixes that http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/20/
[18:06:20] <blindMoe_> don't think there will ever be multiple tables
[18:06:24] <blindMoe_> but I will scope it anyway ;)
[18:06:30] <doug65536> wait a sec, broke it :D
[18:17:33] <doug65536> blindMoe_: ok, this handles multiple tables perfectly, just in case you end up needing it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/5Lwu9/31/
[18:17:56] <blindMoe_> awesome.. ill save it for later use

[18:18:33] <Ericx2x> I have a problem with this site I'm working on. If you click on this button called keep me informed the text goes from being bold to normal because of something to do with the slider. You can replicate it by click on the button hovering your mouse over the slider to make the arrows appear. Does anyone know how to fix this? http://66.147.244.65/~wayneova/index.php
[18:18:34] <doug65536> blindMoe_: np

[18:20:12] <doug65536> Ericx2x: or I am not seeing it
[18:20:39] <Ericx2x> doug65536 oh you're right
[18:20:46] <Ericx2x> i tried on a safari and that doesn't happen
[18:20:59] <doug65536> Ericx2x: which browser does that?
[18:22:06] <Ericx2x> firefox

[18:22:27] <Ericx2x> firefox v 23.0.1
[18:22:51] <doug65536> Ericx2x: yeah, lots of unbalanced tags and invalid stuff. fix that and I expect it to start behaving

[19:04:07] <tieTYT2> hi I'm very confused about when things like $(".level-btn").on "click", (event) -> ...   will apply to elements that are on the page now vs later.  Can someone explain to to me?
[19:05:04] <tieTYT2> for me it seems like sometimes it works on things that I dynamically add and sometimes it doesn't
[19:09:12] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: That would only work on elements you insert later if you rerun it when you insert new elements.
[19:09:54] <tieTYT2> oh ok
[19:10:29] <tieTYT2> well i'm going to dynamically generate a list of buttons.  I want a click action to exist on them.  Is there any way to define the action ahead of time?
[19:10:41] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: You can get it to work on dynamically added elemets by listening on a parent and checking to see if the child that triggered the click is something.
[19:11:22] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: Yeah, you can do like $('.parent-that-holds-button').on('click', 'button', handleButtonClickies );
[19:11:36] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: As long as you're not replace .parent-that-holds-button
[19:11:36] <tieTYT2> oh
[19:11:40] <tieTYT2> what's 'button'?
[19:11:44] <tieTYT2> is that a selector?
[19:11:48] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: Yes.
[19:11:53] <tieTYT2> awesome, thanks
[19:11:59] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[19:12:10] <tieTYT2> i think someone's been trying to tell me that for a long time but I didn't understand it until now
[19:12:31] <BillCriswell> Glad I was able to explain it clearly, since I feel like I'm usually terrible at it.
[19:13:52] <tieTYT2> showing me the example really helped
[19:14:06] <tieTYT2> because I thought I would have to do really annoying stuff to figure out which button i clicked on
[19:14:14] <tieTYT2> I didn't know I could just put a selector there
[19:15:17] <tieTYT2> if I wanted to, could I do this: $('.parent-that-holds-button').on('click', '.class1', handleButtonClickies ); $('.parent-that-holds-button').on('click', '.class2', handleButtonClickies );  ?
[19:15:26] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: Yes.
[19:15:30] <tieTYT2> err, pretend the handler is different in each
[19:15:31] <tieTYT2> ok great
[19:15:40] <tieTYT2> that is way easier than it sounded, thanks
[19:16:36] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: No problem.
[19:16:45] <Velveeta> yeah, query's pretty awesome like that
[19:18:19] <BillCriswell> "the query", as I like to call it, when I'm joking around.
[19:18:33] <tieTYT2> my problem is I don't know how to write idiomatic jquery
[19:18:43] <tieTYT2> probably because I only google for how to do something when I don't know how to
[19:18:51] <tieTYT2> ..do it, that is
[19:20:31] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: Understood.
[19:22:46] <tieTYT2> and that is probably because I think of jquery as a band-aid over a bunch of browser mistakes I wish I didn't have to think about in the first place
[19:23:11] <Velveeta> that's how it started, for sure
[19:30:08] <BillCriswell> Think it was just like, "how can we make javascript not be a pain in the ass?" and it was born.
[19:30:55] <Velveeta> that was jquery's big bang
[19:33:43] <BillCriswell> Haha
[19:39:38] <BillCriswell> I swear some people on stackoverflow get teams of people to upvote their questions.
[19:39:52] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18885347/is-there-an-image-file-format-selector-in-css/18885353#18885353 why is this at 4 votes?
[19:44:04] <tieTYT2> what's wrong with it?
[19:44:29] <tieTYT2> whoa actually considering there's only about 30 views yeah
[19:44:31] <tieTYT2> that's pretty high
[19:45:14] <tieTYT2> but you got my upvote
[19:45:28] <tieTYT2> on SO I noticed the more general purpose the question, the faster you get voted up
[19:46:20] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: Think that's just what's happening here.
[19:51:00] <BillCriswell> tieTYT2: My answer got 9 upvotes in 20 minutes. Never seen that happen so quickly
[20:28:11] <lamarus> Can you still do Model::where_key_and_key($val,$val2)?
[20:28:16] <lamarus> Oops… wrong screen
[20:55:58] <Ericx2x> hey guys
[20:56:07] <Ericx2x> an someone help me with this jquery im writing
[20:56:13] <Ericx2x> i have an anchor tag that i want to use to submit my form
[20:56:20] <Ericx2x> but for some reason it isn't submitting
[20:56:24] <Ericx2x> here is my jquery: http://pastebin.com/HyzbaXvn
[20:56:40] <Ericx2x> i tried adding in the else { form.submit();}
[20:56:49] <Ericx2x> but my anchor tag still doesn't want to submit the form
[21:01:44] <Ericx2x> nevermind i solved it
[21:32:21] <eimajenthat> I've got a function, triggered by a button click.  It runs $.post to send an AJAX request.  The $.post is wrapped in a $(document).ready().  It doesn't seem like this is necessary, but it's there.  However, when I click the button, the request isn't being sent, even after waiting several minutes.  If I remove the $(document).ready(), the request is sent fine.  The same construct is used elsewhere in the app and works fine.  So, w
[21:32:22] <eimajenthat> is it not working here?  Is it necessary?  What does that do besides check if the doc is ready?  Because it's ready.  I spit out document.readyState before, during and after the call to $.post
[21:32:50] <eimajenthat> Maybe code snippets would have been a good idea
[21:32:55] <eimajenthat> or carriage returns
[21:34:02] <Ericx2x> eimajenthat why do you need it in a document ready?
[21:34:10] <Ericx2x> if it is an onclick even i don't think it needs to be in there
[21:34:19] <Ericx2x> i'm not very good at jquery though
[21:34:30] <Ericx2x> maybe wait for an answer from someone who is more experienced
[21:34:49] <eimajenthat> I'm in the same boat: I don't think it needs to be there, and I'm not that good at jQuery
[21:35:09] <eimajenthat> but it's been there quite a while according to git
[21:35:16] <Ericx2x> well it probably isn't working because document ready only runs when the DOM loads the page (i think)
[21:35:35] <Ericx2x> so it doesn't detect the click event?
[21:35:38] <Ericx2x> i'm not sure though
[21:36:39] <eimajenthat> I've got other on click functions where it's working
[21:36:46] <Ericx2x> oh
[21:36:54] <Ericx2x> in that case why not put an alert in your function
[21:36:58] <Ericx2x> to see if it picks up the alert
[21:37:14] <beachandbytes> eimajenthat,  do you have a code sample
[21:37:20] <beachandbytes> is the button loaded via ajax?
[21:38:01] <beachandbytes> for your use case the $(document).ready() is probably a good idea, you add the binding after the document is ready
[21:38:29] <eimajenthat> http://hastebin.com/hudiyugopu.js
[21:38:50] <eimajenthat> wait, that's after I removed the doc ready
[21:38:52] <eimajenthat> one sec
[21:39:49] <eimajenthat> http://hastebin.com/xakehehotu.js
[21:40:30] <beachandbytes> ahh, the $(document).ready() should wrap the rest of your code
[21:40:30] <eimajenthat> button is not loaded via ajax, loaded with the page
[21:40:34] <beachandbytes> it should not fall within a function
[21:41:16] <beachandbytes> http://hastebin.com/fixahabafe.coffee
[21:41:54] <eimajenthat> yeah, that's how I'd generally do it.  Not my code
[21:42:47] <eimajenthat> trying to figure out A if there's a reason for it, and B if there's a good explanation why this would consistently work in one spot, and consistently break in another
[21:45:00] <beachandbytes> well, $document.ready() is an event handler that fires when the document is ready
[21:45:07] <beachandbytes> it does not fire within a function
[21:45:08] <eimajenthat> it looks like it should still work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6027337/document-ready-called-inside-an-external-function
[21:46:09] <beachandbytes> is your external code wrapped in a document.ready?
[21:46:33] <eimajenthat> THAT is an excellent question
[21:48:21] <eimajenthat> no
[21:59:16] <eimajenthat> so the function is defined before document ready, but then it registers an event to happen on ready
[21:59:26] <eimajenthat> but not until it's called, which is before ready
[21:59:53] <eimajenthat> I'm going to hurt myself if I keep going down this path
[22:01:00] <beachandbytes> might be easier to just add a bool isReady = false;
[22:01:07] <beachandbytes> then set it to true when $document is ready
[22:01:11] <beachandbytes> and in your function
[22:01:14] <beachandbytes> do if
[22:01:24] <beachandbytes> if(isReady) { do something }
[22:01:51] <eimajenthat> yeah, that sounds smart
[22:03:17] <eimajenthat> I tried putting the whole function inside a doc ready, but then the on click attribute for the button can't find the function.  I usually select by buttons and add a click event, but this codebase uses the on click attribute out the yinyang
[22:03:24] <someprimetime_> or just set up a promise
[22:03:45] <someprimetime_> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[22:05:48] <beachandbytes> I would have to see the code to see what your trying to do
[22:05:49] <doug65536> onclick attributes :(
[22:06:11] <beachandbytes> why don't you just change the bindings in the js?
[22:07:35] <beachandbytes> should still be in document.ready
[22:11:50] <eimajenthat> which bindings?
[22:15:15] <beachandbytes> I would move all of the onClick attributes to the javascript
[22:16:01] <eimajenthat> probably should
[22:16:05] <eimajenthat> not tonight, though
[22:18:55] <eimajenthat> So, you'd wrap the $.post in the doc ready in case jQuery isn't loaded, right?  But if jQuery isn't loaded, how does $(document).ready get interpreted?  Always wondered that
[22:21:12] <doug65536> eimajenthat: it gets "interpreted" as $ doesn't exist and attempting to call a function with undefined throws an exception, and it abandons further execution
[22:22:03] <eimajenthat> so then it tries again after jQuery is loaded?
[22:22:11] <doug65536> no it doesn't try again
[22:23:14] <boytoy_> Howdy fellas! At http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/1/edit -- anybody know how to replace the default jQuery Mobile loader with the new awesome NProgress (http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/)?
[22:23:24] <beachandbytes> juqery then runs the code after the documentready event is fired
[22:26:06] <eimajenthat> but, it didn't run at first, because query wasn't loaded, so the contained function wasn't bound to the ready even then.  Does jQuery parse all the JS in the request after it get itself loaded?
[22:34:25] <beachandbytes> jquery doesn't parse anything within $(document).ready() untill it is loaded
[22:35:03] <beachandbytes> altho if you include your script before jquery (in include order) you will just get an error
[22:39:34] <doug65536> beachandbytes: jquery doesn't "parse" anything. it is just a library written in javascript
[22:40:07] <doug65536> $ is a function
[22:41:06] <doug65536> functionThatDoesNotExist(123)  <-- throws exception
[22:41:19] <doug65536> $(document)   <--- throws exception
[22:42:03] <doug65536> the .ready ... etc part is irrelevant - it abandons the rest of the script due to unhandled exception
[22:43:30] <beachandbytes> doug65536, ya, parse was bad word
[22:44:12] <eimajenthat> okay, that makes sense I think
[22:44:14] <doug65536> beachandbytes: oh I see what  you were addressing
[22:45:28] <eimajenthat> I had the mistaken impression that you could do $(document).ready before jQuery was loaded, and it would still work somehow, which mystified me.  But that's not the case
[22:45:33] <eimajenthat> so it all makes sense
[22:46:06] <doug65536> eimajenthat: is there some reason jquery isn't loaded yet? why isn't it loaded in head or something
[22:46:22] <doug65536> eimajenthat: are you using requirejs or something?
[22:46:26] <eimajenthat> it is loaded
[22:46:41] <eimajenthat> I was being hypothetical
[22:46:45] <eimajenthat> or maybe just wrong
[23:30:29] <doug65536> wow! http://youtube.com is down!
[23:31:31] <Cork> doug65536: works fine here
[23:31:49] <Cork> ?down http://youtube.com
[23:31:49] <b-ot> Cork: It's just you. http://youtube.com is up! (301 Moved Permanently)
[23:32:12] <doug65536> they are geolocated though
[23:32:24] <doug65536> where are you? which continent
[23:32:40] <Cork> europe
[23:34:04] <doug65536> I'm in north america - I checked on a few "is it up" sites, and they say it is down
[23:34:14] <doug65536> which is a surprise
[23:35:09] <doug65536> it says "500 internal server error - a team of monkeys have been dispatched to deal with the situation. If you see them, show them this information (and then a large block of random letters)
[23:35:56] <Cork> doug65536: http://www.downforeveryone.com/http://youtube.com
[23:36:09] <Cork> doug65536: so.. it looks like it is a fairly local node
[23:36:19] <Cork> and that means youtube.com isn't down
[23:36:27] <Cork> it has disruption
[23:38:48] <doug65536> Cork: why are you so sure
[23:39:28] <Cork> doug65536: cause down means a majority/large part of the net can't access it
[23:39:58] <Cork> doug65536: in this case it looks like it at most is one node, or possibly even just a dns server
[23:40:17] <doug65536> how did a dns error show me that comical 500 error page about the monkeys
[23:40:36] <Cork> cause if you have a dns that caches and ignores the ttl
[23:40:44] <Cork> you will have records that points to the wrong server
[23:40:51] <doug65536> dns made up a joke about moneys fixing it?
[23:40:53] <doug65536> come on
[23:41:00] <Cork> it is a surprisingly common problem
[23:41:09] <Cork> -_-
[23:41:24] <Cork> doug65536: if a server is taken down or moved for some reason
[23:41:27] <Cork> the dns record is changed
[23:41:28] <doug65536> another common problem is people being sure of things that they can't be sure about
[23:41:35] <Cork> but other dns caches ignore the ttl
[23:41:40] <Cork> the changed ip isn't updated
[23:42:11] <Cork> doug65536: well i've had to fiddle with that exact problem quite a bit
[23:43:27] <doug65536> https://www.dropbox.com/s/ao7qyw7et0okcv7/Screenshot-www.youtube.com-watchv%3DNvWTnIoQZj4noredirect%3D1.png
[23:43:49] <Cork> ok?
[23:44:04] <Cork> doug65536: have you ex. tried to make a lookup against 8.8.8.8?
[23:44:22] <Cork> have you checked that the name server actually hold the ip your dns server tells you to use?
[23:44:48] <Cork> the dns name isn't a guarantee it is the server your looking for that has the problem
[23:45:31] <Eol> Is there a way I can get window.prompt() to work jquerily?  I'm running into some issues with google sites
[23:45:52] <Cork> Eol: "jquerily"?
[23:46:02] <Eol> I don't know lol.

[23:46:14] <doug65536> google fanboys :|
[23:46:14] <Eol> "Uncaught script error: Expected property "prompt" to be a function, not undefined: undefined in source: "unknown" at line: 0 "
[23:46:25] <Eol> google sites has this weird javascript sanitizer
[23:46:34] <Eol> $(window).prompt() isn't working..
[23:46:39] <Cork> doug65536: i don't like google at all, but you over simplify how site lookup works
[23:46:52] <Cork> doug65536: just so you know, i don't trust google to hold any data for me
[23:46:53] <Eol> so i dunno if there is a way I can use some innate jquery function to pull that off
[23:47:26] <Cork> Eol: prompt is a dom function
[23:47:29] <Cork> don't use $()
[23:47:38] <Cork> window.prompt() or just prompt()
[23:47:55] <doug65536> Cork: good. at least I've met one person that doesn't worship google then :)
[23:48:03] <Eol> yeah, that isn't working. the sanitizer is killing it.
[23:48:09] <Cork> doug65536: quite far from it
[23:48:22] <Cork> Eol: what sanitizer?
[23:48:29] <Eol> i have no idea
[23:48:44] <Cork> Eol: if you can only call functions on $() your in quite deep shit
[23:49:10] <Cork> cause that would kill String, Array, xhr and so on
[23:49:11] <Eol> lol yeah, i think i am.
[23:49:22] <Cork> Eol: i doubt very much that is the fact
[23:49:38] <Cork> Eol: could you fiddle the section where you get the error?
[23:49:54] <Eol> let me see
[23:52:08] <Eol> No, I can't.
[23:52:14] <Eol> Google sites is rending this insane thing
[23:52:29] <Eol> i'll try another method
[23:52:37] <Cork> ?p
[23:52:46] <Cork> <_<
[23:52:51] * Cork pokes b-ot 
[23:53:13] <Eol> This is literally what it's turning window.prompt("Hello") into: .window:___.ri(IMPORTS___,\'window\'),x0___.prompt_m___?x0___.prompt(\'Hello?\'):x0___.m___(\'prompt\',[\'Hello?\']));if
[23:53:31] <doug65536> eol ????
[23:53:38] <Eol> i swear to god
[23:54:09] <Eol> It's like a CMS kind of thing for google sites.  They allow you to put in javascript, but it doesn't come out raw.  It comes out parsed in some wierd way.
[23:56:14] <doug65536> I can almost make sense of it. what about the colons (:) though?
[23:57:06] <Eol> i don't know, this idea is a lost cause
[23:57:16] <doug65536> assuming you omitted the opening brace, I don't see a closing brace
[23:57:28] <Eol> oh yeah, there's tons more
[23:57:30] <Eol> i'll try another way
[23:57:48] <vhsjon> hi guys, I set a class on a select element to ".activeElementDropdown" depending on some choices a user can do. But when after IVe set the class with .addClass("activeElementDropdown"); The $(".activeElementDropdown").on("change", function(){}); event doesnt trigger. Any ideas?
[23:58:55] <doug65536> vhsjon: did you do the .on('change'... before you added the class?
[23:59:08] <anli> In the .update handler of .sortable, I am going through all tr:s in a table to do something with them, however, in that iteration, the clone is included, how can I distinguish it from the "real" trs?
[23:59:28] <anli> Or can I do this in another handler where the clone is removed?
[23:59:50] <vhsjon> doug65536: if Ive declared the on change method after I set the class in my code?
