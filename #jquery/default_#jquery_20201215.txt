[01:25:54] <Robdgreat> y'all.
[01:26:03] <robertmaxrees> my dude
[01:26:10] <Robdgreat> thanks for continuing to demonstrate why I like using a nick color script
[01:26:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:26:42] <Robdgreat> I look in and think what the hell, he's talking to himself in two color- oh
[01:27:19] <Robdgreat> weird wild stuff
[01:27:51] <robertmaxrees> said Rob, commenting on a convo between Robert and Robert.
[01:30:37] <Robdgreat> hey, my nick is not the same length, and wouldn't even be if I changed it to robertdgreat
[01:30:48] <Robdgreat> it's the identical length that makes it so surreal
[01:31:07] <robertmaxrees> don't worry, it trips me up, too ;)
[01:31:23] <robertmaxrees> should just go back to my original handle
[01:31:34] <Robdgreat> this is mine >.>
[01:31:54] <Robdgreat> I changed from it very briefly in early 1999
[01:32:37] <duch_kazatel> it's weird how nicks are either SUPER personal or just off-the-cuff identities.
[01:32:41] <Robdgreat> was Herr_Rob long enough to have it get the attention of my now-gf who was learning German at the time xD
[01:32:58] <duch_kazatel> hah niiice
[01:33:21] <Robdgreat> so in hindsight, that was the sole purpose of that whimsical change hah
[08:25:10] <_Shadow> Hello.
[08:26:12] <_Shadow> I'm having a pretty critical issue with the JQuery CDN. Sites (outside my control) which try to access the hosted library end up getting too many redirects. One of those sites is work-related, and it's killing me.
[08:27:29] <_Shadow> It has something to do with my IP, since it doesn't happen on other computers. I had to use a VPN to access the site and support means to present this issue to you.
[08:27:54] <_Shadow> But I can't crush my internet speeds with VPNs and proxies on a regular basis.
[08:30:37] <Cork> _Shadow: there isn't any redirect based on ip
[08:30:58] <Cork> might be you have a dns record or hosts file entry for the cdn that isn't the correct one?
[08:31:43] <_Shadow> I have no idea
[08:32:18] <_Shadow> I haven't touched my hosts file in relation to JQuery. Haven't touched it in a long while, for any purpose.
[08:33:18] <_Shadow> As for DNS, I had Google's, but this morning I switched to my ISP automatic ones, whatever those might be, and it didn't change anything.
[08:37:07] <Cork> _Shadow: my point is I don't think it is on the server side the problem happens
[08:38:30] <_Shadow> But it happens with a specific site, code.jquery.com
[08:38:53] <_Shadow> If the problem's on my end, how could I solve it? If I use a VPN, the site can be accessed normally, but that's no solution
[08:39:14] <_Shadow> There's some interaction between the site and my IP that's creating this problem.
[08:39:22] <Cork> firstly i would start by using dig or nslookup to check what record your actually getting
[08:39:23] <_Shadow> I just flushed DNS and nothing happened
[08:39:38] <Cork> then use something like curl -v and check what the redirect loop actually contains
[08:39:50] <Cork> so it ins't something forcing http instead of https or something
[08:40:24] <Cork> if you don't find anything weird there present the info in a paste and we might be able to find something
[08:41:50] <_Shadow> Are those commands I can use on my cmd terminal? I use Windows 10, and am not a systems analyst...
[08:42:50] <Cork> curl is a command line http lib, dig is a dns analyse tool, and nslookup is another (the first one doesn't exists in windows as far as i know)
[08:52:14] <_Shadow> No clue. This worked literally for years until yesterday, and I never went about forcing HTTP or anything. According to the browser dev view, I get code 301 errors 15-20 times until the site gives up.
[08:52:54] <_Shadow> If a DNS record is corrupt or something, how can I reset it or otherwise rectify it?
[08:53:17] <_Shadow> Flushing DNS didn't change anything, and this is happening across three browsers. Opera GX, Chrome, Firefox.
[08:53:41] <_Shadow> Add Edge to the list
[08:58:15] <Cork> _Shadow: it isn't a browser cache problem
[08:59:08] <Cork> but as it is a cdn you need to provide information so someone else can double check the result
[09:09:37] <_Shadow> this is the basic nslookup I did from my Windows 10 command terminal
[09:09:39] <_Shadow> https://pastebin.com/ER33Z63a
[09:10:52] <_Shadow> Discussing this with my company's IT department, the mentioned users from Uruguay and Chile having this issue. We're from Argentina ourselves. Unfortunately, I don't have any further information.
[09:11:01] <_Shadow> they mentioned*
[09:11:44] <Cork> and what url is it you get redirects for?
[09:12:11] <_Shadow> https://code.jquery.com/
[09:12:23] <Cork> so the base html end point?
[09:14:51] <Cork> well it loads just fine for me on both https and http for that cdn end point
[09:15:07] <Cork> so you need to dig up what responses your actually getting
[09:15:22] <Cork> (suggest using the command line curl, i think microsoft is including it now days)
[09:15:57] <_Shadow> I can be the core address, but it happens when calling the libraries themselves
[09:16:02] <_Shadow> For example, https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js
[09:16:19] <Cork> ya, so try curl -v https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js in a termianl
[09:18:09] <_Shadow> https://pastebin.com/dEphcj2E
[09:22:12] <Cork> and you don't have a proxy or corp firewall or something like that infront of your machine?
[09:22:30] <_Shadow> No. I'm working from home. This is my own personal desktop.
[09:22:32] <Cork> cause it looks like something is mucking around with the 443 port connection
[09:23:02] <Cork> do you haev another machine at home you can test with?
[09:23:11] <Cork> like a phone
[09:23:26] <_Shadow> yes
[09:23:29] <_Shadow> My phone
[09:23:35] <Cork> make sure your on wifi before you try
[09:23:55] <_Shadow> do I have to download some terminal app?
[09:24:04] <Cork> no, just try to load the same url in a browser
[09:24:44] <_Shadow> Yeah, I had tried that. Same issue
[09:24:51] <_Shadow> From Android Chrome
[09:24:52] <Cork> hmm
[09:27:11] <Cork> and when you used a vpn was the vpn end point "close to you"?
[09:27:32] <_Shadow> No. I think it's in the US
[09:27:38] <Cork> reason i asked is a server can share an ip, and then whaere your located matters
[09:27:56] <Cork> donno if jquerys cdn uses that
[09:27:57] <_Shadow> My normal IP is Argentinian, Buenos Aires.
[09:28:06] <Cork> can't really use that for anything
[09:28:49] <Cork> how long have you had the problem btw?
[09:28:55] <_Shadow> Since yesterday
[09:29:23] <Cork> should been seen and fixed if it was a node problem in that time span i think...
[09:30:24] <Cork> well, i would prob try to use a vpn as close to use as possible, and see if you get the same error there
[09:30:55] <Cork> i don't know of a way to contact the server admins for the cdn so donno how to help you except that
[09:31:33] <_Shadow> My current VPN address starts with 77. whereas my original address is 200. The VPN I'm using is Opera GX's integrated one, which only allows picking from the Americas, Europe or Asia on a continental basis.
[09:32:33] <_Shadow> "Optimal location" was that 77.xxx and that's in the US, so I'd wager they don't have addresses closer to my geographic location.
[09:33:19] <Cork> ya, that is prob what is happening
[09:34:00] <_Shadow> Wait, no, this VPN address is actually Swedish...
[09:34:35] <_Shadow> Bah, this geolocate site may be wrong
[09:34:37] <Cork> just saw that theres been a comment about a broken cdn in infratrustrue, and there seems to have been a problem with it the last 2 weeks; ouch...
[09:35:11] <_Shadow> As long as they're aware of the issue...
[09:35:26] <Cork> i used to chat with the infrastructure gues regularly a few years ago, but haven't seen them in ages now so not much to do i'm affraid
[09:35:38] <Cork> _Shadow: that was a third party
[09:35:47] <Cork> so donno if they are aware
[09:36:18] <_Shadow> The only info I can provide is that it could be affecting parts of South America: Argentina, Uruguay, Chile. But that's probably too vague to be useful.
[09:37:01] <Cork> donno, might not be for someone who knows the locations of the cdn nodes
[09:37:30] <Cork> but, ya your only option is prob to just use the vpn for now :/
[10:04:31] <s90> hi, im having a problem with https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js responding with a redirect to the same site, causing a redirect loop ending in TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS, does anyone have the same problem?
[10:05:13] <s90> It's weird, it happens from only one ip (that i know of) but i can't find anything there blocking or intercepting stuff
[10:07:26] <_Shadow> Well, look at that :P
[10:07:50] <_Shadow> I was just explaining the same thing happening to me.
[10:08:16] <s90> :(
[10:08:24] <_Shadow> Where do you live?
[10:08:31] <s90> Argentina
[10:08:38] <_Shadow> Maldito bastardo, yo tambi√©n
[10:08:40] <_Shadow> jajajajaja
[10:08:51] <s90> Iplan?
[10:08:55] <_Shadow> Yes
[10:09:04] <s90> ....
[10:09:13] <s90> so the problem is the ISP
[10:09:26] <s90> puta madre
[10:09:44] <_Shadow> Possibly, but I have reports of it happening in Uruguay and Chile
[10:09:54] <_Shadow> According to my company's IT department
[10:10:21] <s90> From home and from a remote server it works ok.
[10:10:46] <_Shadow> Right now I'm using Opera GX's integrated VPN to change my public IP, and it works then, but...
[10:10:51] <s90> From the office, behind an untangle firewall, it fails (i double checked the firewall and it does'nt seem to be the problem)
[10:19:11] <s90> Working request: https://pastebin.com/hBS4Udk9 Failing request: https://pastebin.com/VikExT5v same request from different sites
[10:33:06] <s90> this started happening yesterday around 18:00 UTC
[10:33:56] <s90> i have a build job failing 18:11 (and every other after that) and the same being successful up to 17:41 (~30m between builds)
[10:35:52] <bboy1> Hi guys, I'm trying to create a rating star using JQuery. My issue is when I select a rating from 1 to 5. The rating should shows from 1 to the one that I clicked, Please check: https://www.codeply.com/p/xxa3kNO03R
[10:36:29] <bboy1> I also want to view the number of stars
[10:37:03] <bboy1> Rating: 2/5
[13:30:39] <marcosnils> :wave: anyone here? Just wondering if there's been any updates on code.jquery.com not working for ipv6 requests

[13:31:51] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:31:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> marcosnils is there a ticket submitted to the github repo for the site?
[13:32:52] <marcosnils> robertmaxrees nope, I found out about this like two days ago and tried contacting @Jquery in twitter but couldn't find out where support tickets should be submitted
[13:33:04] <marcosnils> I think this is kind of important since it's breaking a bunch of websites
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/52
[13:33:36] <marcosnils> 2019? :wow:
[13:33:42] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's known and not a jquery issue.
[13:34:47] <marcosnils> seems like.. This is going to be come a big problem in the near future as clients start shifting to ipv6
[13:35:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.  best you can do is leave a comment there.  or point to a different CDN.
[13:35:37] <marcosnils> yep, I'll do that. Thx for pointing to the right direction
[13:35:38] <marcosnils> :pray:
[14:45:09] <bboy> guys, I need some help in completing this rating. I want when I hover the star should start from 0 until the one I hover on. Also I want to view the rating once I click on the star. For example: Rating:2/5
[14:45:38] <bboy> https://www.codeply.com/p/xxa3kNO03R
[14:46:42] <robertmaxrees> bboy let's take it one step at a time.
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:47:04] <robertmaxrees> so for the first one - you want to select all stars up to the current one, right?
[14:47:21] <bboy> In my jquery the first start has class of start. Once I click for example the fourth start. The jquery will add stop class.
[14:47:25] <bboy> Yes
[14:47:30] <robertmaxrees> "start"?
[14:47:34] <bboy> Yes
[14:47:35] <robertmaxrees> :confused:
[14:47:39] <robertmaxrees> you mean star?
[14:47:54] <bboy> <i class="fa fa-star-o start"></i>
[14:48:01] <robertmaxrees> oh, the first star has a class of "start".  not really needed fwiw :)
[14:48:18] <bboy> OK, I need any solution
[14:48:25] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to approach this.  can you modify the html?
[14:48:36] <bboy> OK, tell me
[14:48:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not an answer to my question?
[14:49:01] <bboy> Yes, I can modify the html
[14:49:44] <robertmaxrees> you could add a data attribute to each with the rating number, then add a class to each one and do some simple math.  another approach would use something like .prevAll();
[14:54:19] <bboy> OK, I'm trying it. Thanks
[15:01:56] <bboy> robertmaxrees. I've done some changes using prevAll() but I have some mistake. https://www.codeply.com/p/xxa3kNO03R
[15:15:13] <robertmaxrees> bboy i'm not seeing prevall being used there.
[15:15:23] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm.
[15:15:45] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> did you read the documentation for prevAll bboy?
[15:27:44] <bboy> Sorry robertmaxrees , I was taking launch. I already added the prevAll
[15:28:28] <bboy> I'm trying to use something like this: $("i.fa", this).prevAll().removeClass("fa-star-o").addClass("fa-star");
[15:29:50] <mulch2> any idea why i wouldn't be able to target an element in an iframe? i'm going crazy over here.
[15:34:33] <robertmaxrees> bboy so did you read the documentation for prevAll()?
[15:34:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:34:39] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 CORS
[15:34:55] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 if CORS isn't in play, then you need to make sure you properly use .contents()
[15:35:03] <robertmaxrees> (iirc that's what it is at least)
[15:36:28] <robertmaxrees> bboy i ask because your code is getting the <i> and then trying to use .prevAll(), but that won't work - the <i> tags are nested.  you need to be a level "up" and look for those elements instead.
[15:41:42] <bboy> ok
[15:42:11] <bboy> I will try
[15:47:01] <mulch2> robertmaxrees: i had "var x = document.getElementsByTagName("iframe")[0].contentWindow;" in the document ready function, and it was hit or miss. so, i moved it to a $(window).on('load' function, and it seems more consistent...
[15:47:27] <mulch2> should've prefaced with this isn't my language at all, but i guess that's apparent lol
[15:47:32] <mulch2> thank you, btw
[15:48:34] <mulch2> i guess it's just a timing thing? but can it be regulated to be reliable? the hit-or-miss thing is discouraging.
[15:49:31] <mulch2> this site has multiple i-frames full of stuff, and i'm just trying to make it work.
[15:50:47] <mulch2> all i'm trying to do is replace an img src on one of the i-frames after everything loads.
[16:11:44] <robertmaxrees> weird dunno what's up with my connection.
[16:12:25] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 "reliable" depends tbh.
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> do you have control over the contents of the iframe?
[16:21:29] <mulch2> yeah, somewhat. it's all written in jsp and relies on dynamic datatables, etc.
[16:21:39] <mulch2> have def learned a lot these past two weeks.
[16:21:46] <robertmaxrees> so the second question - why not put this code inside the iframe source instead?
[16:23:02] <mulch2> because i needed a variable that didn't exist yet.
[16:23:24] <robertmaxrees> gotcha, the var only exists on the "parent" window?
[16:24:19] <mulch2> right, so the function was returning the url to replace the img src with, but i couldn't target the dang image, lol. four HOURS.
[16:24:27] <mulch2> until you responded lol.
[16:24:44] <robertmaxrees> is it just an image ID or a full URL?
[16:24:49] <mulch2> url
[16:24:52] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[16:25:15] <mulch2> but as of now... it's working :)))
[16:25:22] <robertmaxrees> so the only "reliable" way to do this is to create an iframe element, attach the load event listener, and THEN set the src attribute.
[16:25:29] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll always be racing.
[16:25:35] <mulch2> ahh
[16:26:04] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could fire a postMessage or something similar from inside the iframe to notify the parent that it's ready.
[16:26:18] <mulch2> like, create the iframe element after the target? or does it matter?
[16:26:26] <robertmaxrees> "after the target"??
[16:26:36] <mulch2> like, the DOM order
[16:26:43] <robertmaxrees> what target?
[16:26:54] <mulch2> the img im trying to replace the src
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> wait, in response to which suggestion??
[16:27:28] <mulch2> the iframe elem with load event
[16:27:57] <robertmaxrees> confused about what load order has to do with anything there - you wouldn't have an iframe element on the page in that case.
[16:28:16] <robertmaxrees> you just append the iframe with the handler attached to whatever element you want.
[16:28:33] <mulch2> maybe i'm being thrown off because the img is in a td in a datatable that is the last thing to appear on the screen.
[16:28:52] <robertmaxrees> right, we're not talking about the iframe contents.
[16:28:59] <mulch2> k
[16:29:18] <robertmaxrees> though this raises another question - does that datatable get added dynamically after any async operations?
[16:29:58] <mulch2> i believe so, tho i'm not entirely sure what that entails either
[16:30:14] <robertmaxrees> then my load handler suggestion won't work.
[16:30:27] <robertmaxrees> since that's another race.
[16:30:50] <mulch2> are these races just a part of the game?
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> "the game"?
[16:31:07] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean of frontend engineering?
[16:31:10] <mulch2> lmao
[16:31:12] <mulch2> yes
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  js deals with async all the time.
[16:31:31] <robertmaxrees> really not that hard to contend with.  it's why we have event listeners :)
[16:31:49] <robertmaxrees> though i'm confused about how the iframe source wouldn't have certain information the parent window would.
[16:32:00] <mulch2> i hear you. it's becoming more clear that my biggest issues haven't been with any of this stuff, just my own ignorance.
[16:32:18] <robertmaxrees> nah, not ignorange.  just a different set of paradigms :)
[16:33:16] <robertmaxrees> *ignorance
[16:33:55] <mulch2> well, there are just so many tables that are all being dynamically populated. like, i didn't realize the img in question was in a table -- i thought it was just a div.
[16:34:12] <robertmaxrees> still confused tho :)
[16:34:20] <robertmaxrees> is the image tied to a user session or something?
[16:35:29] <mulch2> it's a self-hosted music server (airsonic), so if i do a search for a particular album, the img was associated with the artist.
[16:35:33] <mulch2> if that makes more sense
[16:36:02] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  so the parent window has the search, and then you load the iframe with info about that search?
[16:36:07] <mulch2> right
[16:36:13] <mulch2> ive never seen so many i-frames
[16:36:17] <mulch2> and tables.
[16:36:41] <mulch2> and i didn't know in my "ignorance" that i couldn't just target any unique id
[16:36:44] <mulch2> like in css
[16:36:58] <robertmaxrees> so if the iframe knows what the search term is in that case, why can't it also grab the image for you?
[16:37:12] <robertmaxrees> also: why use iframes at all?
[16:38:59] <mulch2> well the img is coming from elsewhere, as a workaround, since it's not working for whatever reason. so, it was either a blank box orr using an external src.
[16:39:14] <mulch2> the second question is what i've been asking for a week
[16:39:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm still very confused about the image thing - you can put that logic inside of the iframe source.  are you saying you tried to and you couldn't seem to get it to work?
[16:40:45] <mulch2> yeah, so in the iframe source code, i needed "artist" variable, which i couldn't figure out how to get from the code.
[16:41:08] <robertmaxrees> due to ajax-y goodness? :)
[16:41:12] <mulch2> the datatables were quite daunting, and there seemed like a maze of functions all calling each other.
[16:41:21] <mulch2> haha, right
[16:41:43] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah, sounds like you just need to get your head around event handlers and callbacks then.
[16:42:00] <mulch2> someone like you would've probably done all this during a commercial break.
[16:42:10] <mulch2> yeah, amen to that.
[16:42:27] <mulch2> but learning is so fun. i'm glad i've embarked on this lil journey.
[16:42:37] <robertmaxrees> oh totally.  it can be a ton of fun :)
[16:42:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest getting the async stuff in yer noggin instead of the buggy workaround
[16:42:54] <mulch2> particularly when you solve your problems and see your vision come to life
[16:42:57] <mulch2> haha
[16:43:03] <mulch2> hitting a wall, not so much
[16:43:16] <mulch2> where should i start?
[16:43:19] <robertmaxrees> you can do it - got plenty of resources available to help :)
[16:43:22] <mulch2> just an essential course maybe?
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ has some info.
[16:43:49] <mulch2> im currently finishing a python course
[16:44:10] <mulch2> right on, thanks.
[16:44:33] <robertmaxrees> going on a learning spree I take it?
[16:44:49] <mulch2> yeah, no better time than a global pandemic, lol
[16:45:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:46:16] <mulch2> what do you do, exactly?
[16:46:27] <robertmaxrees> I'm an application development manager and a technical lead.
[16:46:35] <mulch2> nice
[16:46:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:47:20] <mulch2> making the big bucks.
[16:47:30] <robertmaxrees> sort of
[16:47:46] <mulch2> lol
[16:48:23] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: just because money is coming in doesn't mean i get to keep it all ;)
[16:48:32] <mulch2> haha, i hear that
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> divorce is a helluva thing.
[16:48:46] <mulch2> tho i'm not married yet
[16:49:02] <robertmaxrees> tax breaks for being married are :100: amazing.
[16:49:13] <mulch2> haha
[16:49:26] <mulch2> sorry about the divorce. unless you wanted it.
[16:49:32] <robertmaxrees> i did :)
[16:49:36] <mulch2> jerk
[16:49:38] <mulch2> jk, lol
[16:49:42] <robertmaxrees> pretty much ;)
[16:49:51] <robertmaxrees> finally wrapping it all up.  one of the good things about 2020
[16:49:58] <mulch2> how long has it taken?
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> everything including financial stuff was about 3 years.
[16:50:51] <mulch2> damn!
[16:51:26] <mulch2> that's about as long as it took me to change an i-frame img src.
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:51:42] <robertmaxrees> (it's just iframe btw)
[16:51:54] <mulch2> oh, no hyphen. gotcha
[16:52:00] <mulch2> dunno where i got that from.
[16:52:39] <robertmaxrees> oh don't worry - people like to capitalize and hyphenate things in interesting ways.  some folks think it's iFrame, but it has nothing to do with apple (just short for "inline frame").
[16:52:55] <mulch2> haha
[17:01:23] <mulch2> oh, snap -- while you're here (if you're still here):
[17:01:30] <mulch2> are you familiar with this js audio visualizer: https://foobar404.github.io/Wave.js/#/docs
[17:01:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:01:42] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:01:47] <mulch2> i've gotten it to work with an <audio> tag and single mp3 file, but can you think of anything special i'd have to do to get it to work with a player that's loading and playing music dynamically? i used the audio id i found in my source, but so far to no avail.
[17:02:07] <mulch2> probably not real related to this chan, actually.
[17:02:12] <mulch2> but just throwing it out there.
[17:02:23] <mulch2> because you're a genius and all.
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ either way, that page tells you exactly what you need to do.
[17:03:27] <mulch2> you know how these docs can be arcane.
[17:03:42] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[17:03:51] <robertmaxrees> did you read them? :)
[17:04:08] <robertmaxrees> because there's this: "The "fromElement" function takes a audio element id , canvas id, and a object of options that change how the visual looks. Once called, the visuals will begin to play to the canvas element when the play button is pressed."
[17:05:10] <mulch2> haha, right! and that's how i got my test to work. but idk why when i tried the same function with a different audio id (from my server), nothing happened.
[17:05:29] <robertmaxrees> so in cases like that, share your code so we can see what you're doing.
[17:11:39] <mulch2> that makes sense. i guess i was just hoping you wouldn't say something disappointing that was common knowledge among devs or something. sounds like it should work ultimately, so i'm hopeful for now. it's a pretty entrancing idea; hope i can get it working.
[17:11:52] <mulch2> gonna study the docs again and keep trying. i'll put some code in a bin, too, just in case.
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> k.
[17:12:35] <mulch2> thanks again btw for all the other help -- i appreciate it.
[17:12:53] <robertmaxrees> going to guess you're mixing up your order of operations.  probably need to create the audio element and then init the library.
[17:13:06] <robertmaxrees> might also need to wait for it to have loaded but :shrug:
[17:13:23] <mulch2> the race!
[17:13:28] <mulch2> that makes a lot of sense
[17:14:01] <robertmaxrees> code can't act on data it doesn't have.
[17:14:06] <mulch2> the player doesn't even have an id until i press play, i don't think.
[17:14:10] <mulch2> see! genius
[17:14:35] <mulch2> i knew you'd say something that would put me in the right direction.
[17:15:37] <robertmaxrees> https://foobar404.github.io/Wave.js/#/
[17:16:05] <robertmaxrees> examples like this are helpufl, as well, because you can inspect them and look at the code yourself to see how they accomplished basic things.
[17:18:51] <mulch2> inspecting now...
[17:19:18] <mulch2> i think the "wait for it to load" thing was key.
[17:19:29] <robertmaxrees> it may have that part figured out for you.
[17:19:35] <mulch2> versus the static content in the examples.
[17:19:40] <mulch2> unless i'm wrong on that.
[17:20:34] <robertmaxrees> ah, looks like a react app, to boot.
[17:21:19] <robertmaxrees> either way, play around, read the source of the library, etc.
[17:21:38] <mulch2> i had a MutationObserver enabled earlier, and the player was going crazy in the bg.
[17:21:47] <robertmaxrees> don't use mutationobservers.
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> pretty much ever
[17:22:02] <mulch2> lol, was short-lived.
[17:22:07] <mulch2> made everything so sluggish.
[17:22:08] <robertmaxrees> :) they're a great way to give yourself headaches.
[17:22:14] <mulch2> haha
[17:22:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you use them wrong you end up re-running the same code over and over.
[17:22:38] <mulch2> oh, i def got caught in one or two infinite loops
[23:18:17] <sydbarret> how can i change some properties of the object called data here https://bpa.st/MH7Q ?
[23:18:54] <sydbarret> data.search.search.replace('\\b', '');  doesnt seem to work
[23:35:23] <bboy> hi guys, I need some help in completing this rating. I want when I hover it change the color of stars until the one I hover. Once I click on any star, the next line will show the Rating 2/5
