[06:33:50] <sine0> folks
[06:34:12] <sine0> I have this in an on document ready, I have tested out alert('hi'); which works, its loading etc
[06:34:15] <sine0> jQuery('head').append('<style type="text/css">body{background:purple}</style>');
[06:34:25] <sine0> this is not appending a style to the header, why ?
[06:35:24] <sine0> it is working. always with the last minute fixes...
[07:04:06] <Robdgreat> sine0: why are you doing this? I'd just do $(body).css('background', 'purple');
[07:04:36] <Robdgreat> sorry, s/\$/jQuery/ I guess
[07:18:42] <sine0> its ok I have done what I wanted to do. I am also inserting elements into the body <div etc with class and I want to drop the class in the head as well
[07:18:52] <sine0> so injecting styles and elements into head and body
[07:21:09] <sine0> squirting styles right up it
[08:06:57] <kevireilly> sine0: is there a particular reason you do not just include the required CSS in your stylesheet and optionally add the appropriate classes to elements instead/only? (I may have missed some responses in the past 40 minutes)
[10:37:46] <thedonut> Anyone have any ideas why in the results of my code, it's copying and appending each photo, instead of just making a card for each photo?

[13:00:01] <DevilTiger> i'm using list.js to display some data. i'm trying to loop through an object and hide all data that doesn't match but its hiding everything but the last result that matches. i can't wrap my head around a fix
[13:00:46] <DevilTiger> i'm using filter to return item.values() that are == to my object.id
[13:58:27] <Cork> DevilTiger: could you show a jsfiddle with the code you're working with?
[14:02:04] <DevilTiger> i'm trying to simplify it but it's really not that much different from the first example here: http://listjs.com/docs/
[14:02:58] <DevilTiger> i have existing data i'm using to populate list.js and i want to return objects in that list that match an object key in another object
[14:03:12] <Cork> ya, it is your filter code i need
[14:03:25] <Cork> cause it is most likely there something happens
[14:05:25] <Cork> DevilTiger: you're using the filter method?
[14:06:02] <DevilTiger> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bKYrmM
[14:07:13] <Cork> that code doesn't parse
[14:07:18] <Cork> you have a stray ]
[14:08:01] <DevilTiger> ok copy /paste error
[14:08:05] <Cork> also are you sure you want id.includes(results[i].i) that looks weird
[14:08:26] <DevilTiger> i'm trying to isolate list items who's id match the result id
[14:08:28] <Cork> cause that means if i is "1" and the id is "10021" or "12" it will match
[14:08:31] <DevilTiger> is that not the way you do it
[14:09:16] <DevilTiger> is there a way to copy an object from devtools
[14:09:26] <DevilTiger> the console that is
[14:09:27] <Cork> you need to convert results[].i to an array
[14:09:59] <Cork> something like var ids = $.map(results, function(elm) { return elm.i });
[14:10:10] <Cork> and then ids.includes(item.values().id)
[14:10:54] <DevilTiger> inside my filter function for the last one right
[14:11:04] <DevilTiger> and eliminate my for loop?
[14:11:05] <Cork> before the filter function
[14:11:14] <Cork> else you will construct an array for each element in the list
[14:11:34] <DevilTiger> i don't understand. i dont have item unless i call the filter function
[14:11:37] <Cork> basically when you get the "results" before you start using it, filter outs the ids
[14:11:39] <DevilTiger> item is what i'm searching
[14:11:45] <Cork> other way around
[14:12:02] <DevilTiger> please elaborate. i'm not understanding what you mean
[14:12:06] <Cork> you get a "results" it needs to be converted to something you can easily check
[14:12:13] <DevilTiger> gotcha, got that
[14:12:17] <DevilTiger> [20, 40, 42, 45, 49, 24]
[14:12:24] <DevilTiger> that is the array after mapping
[14:12:26] <Cork> ya, that is the $.map call
[14:12:34] <DevilTiger> ok. now stop
[14:12:34] <Cork> do that before you call filter
[14:12:40] <DevilTiger> i did that.
[14:12:42] <DevilTiger> that wasn't what i asked
[14:12:49] <DevilTiger> "and then ids.includes(item.values().id)"
[14:12:52] <Cork> then in the filter you check if the ids include the current rows id
[14:12:55] <DevilTiger> THAT is what i was asking if it needs to be in my filter function
[14:13:01] <Cork> yes
[14:13:05] <DevilTiger> lol so why no earlier
[14:13:18] <Cork> the callback is called once for each row
[14:14:14] <DevilTiger> all are returning false now
[14:14:34] <DevilTiger> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bKYrmM
[14:14:36] <DevilTiger> code currently
[14:14:54] <Cork> then you need to debug why try something like console.log(item.values().id, ids.includes(item.values().id), ids); before the if
[14:15:34] <Cork> you inverted the if case
[14:15:41] <Cork> you check if the array is in the id
[14:15:46] <Cork> and that will alway be false
[14:15:54] <DevilTiger> dev tools UI is garbage. trying to export console

[14:17:28] <DevilTiger> not that simple
[14:18:52] <Cork> ya, just ignore the bot
[14:18:58] <DevilTiger> oh lol
[14:19:28] <Cork> did you see my comment?=
[14:20:14] <Cork> (before the ui is garbage line)
[14:20:29] <DevilTiger> do you mind being a little more verbose
[14:20:39] <DevilTiger> i've tried reversing the if and no change
[14:20:44] <Cork> i've given you the exact line to use...
[14:20:50] <Cork> how can i be more verbose...?
[14:21:00] <DevilTiger> right: i pasted a link to the console output for the line you gave me
[14:21:18] <Cork> ya, but the .contains line you use is inverted
[14:21:28] <Cork> sorry includes
[14:21:38] <Cork> check the code i gave you
[14:21:50] <DevilTiger> lol i dont understand what you mean
[14:21:54] <DevilTiger> you gave me a console log snippet
[14:21:55] <DevilTiger> i've checked
[14:21:57] <DevilTiger> i'm checking
[14:21:59] <DevilTiger> that is what i'm doing
[14:22:04] <Cork> ya, check the earlier code...
[14:22:30] <Cork> and actually it was part of what i gave you too
[14:22:30] <DevilTiger> var ids = $.map(results, function(elm) { return elm.i });
[14:22:38] <DevilTiger> that is the last code before that
[14:22:40] <DevilTiger> i've added it
[14:22:42] <DevilTiger> i'm using it
[14:22:45] <DevilTiger> its in my codepen
[14:23:52] <DevilTiger> in the pastebin i sent you theres multiple times where the id that's being searched for in the array is preset
[14:23:55] <DevilTiger> but somehow still returning false
[14:24:50] <DevilTiger>                 if (ids.includes(item.values().id)) {
[14:24:50] <DevilTiger>  should work
[14:26:50] <DevilTiger> i think i got it. item.values().id was a str not an int
[14:27:32] <DevilTiger> thank you. i don't think i would've gotten that without your help
[16:49:15] <DevilTiger> now i'm trying to wrap my head around how to filter on top of other filters
[18:18:48] <pdub> samsch: breathing a sigh of relief. things are working the way I expect them to.  I realized I had confused myself a bit before. And I also overthought the issue, at least in terms of selecting thru this finalData.  So glad i am back on track now. https://ibb.co/fqdyNy
[19:00:40] <DevilTiger> nice
[19:41:10] <pdub> I have two arrays.  Both contain the same number of objects (two total).  I would like to assimilate all their properties, so that I have one final array of two objects (with each object containing all properties from the two previously separate indexed objects per array)
[19:41:35] <pdub> Basically, I want to assimilate the objects' properties of these two arrays into one: https://pastebin.com/HiY50tJj

[19:42:31] <pdub> I tried some merge type functions... and they're basically just concatenating the two, but not combining the subobjects together
[19:42:55] <pdub> I need to output one array from two... not sure what the best function is for that
[19:43:06] <pdub> i guess just two nested for loops
[19:43:27] <pdub> or nested maps perhaps
