[03:24:29] * AlbertoP thinks robertmaxrees is laughing by himself ;)
[03:28:29] <robertmaxrees> nah, i was giggling at Rockwood.
[03:28:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[03:29:04] <AlbertoP> :P
[03:29:22] <AlbertoP> I figured, but the joke seemed funny >:)
[06:03:36] <AlbertoP__> BS4 seems "improvement" backward... lot of stuff needed 1 line, now it's a mess of nested stuff mah.
[10:53:06] <Rockwood> any active?
[10:59:37] <AlbertoP> Rockwood, useless to ask. Ask your question ;-)
[11:00:05] <Woet> Rockwood has been on IRC for many years and still doesn't know the very basics of asking for help
[11:00:09] <Woet> https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/
[11:00:39] <Rockwood> i wanna get value instead of text from anchor tag
[11:01:25] <Woet> go ahead.
[11:01:59] <Rockwood> wait let me make test case
[11:02:50] <Woet> that should be step 1
[11:06:10] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/jqaL9pvn/
[11:09:28] <Rockwood> English, Gk, Maths are coming from DB
[11:09:40] <Rockwood> they have unique ids
[11:09:50] <Rockwood> so i wanna get ids
[11:10:14] <Rockwood> i am still confused to put it in html and how to get get by href tag
[11:10:20] <Rockwood> anchor tag
[11:10:56] <Rockwood> text is not important  in my case
[11:12:58] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/1vr0q8es/
[11:13:10] <Rockwood> how to put id in href
[11:14:03] * Rockwood is still looking for response 
[11:16:01] <Rockwood> is the corrrect way data-value="1"?
[11:17:14] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/yv3dw76k/1/ still no value comes
[11:18:10] <Rockwood> something is goes off here
[11:23:13] <AlbertoP> Rockwood, what do you use on the server side?
[11:23:57] <AlbertoP> and, do you want the Id of the entry in the DB? :-?
[11:25:13] <Rockwood> AlbertoP, mysql php
[11:27:08] * AlbertoP does not understand what needs to be retrieved :-?
[11:30:53] <Woet> Rockwood: https://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:36:00] <Rockwood> AlbertoP, i wanna retrieve data-value="1"
[11:36:15] <Rockwood> Woet, how to use in my case
[11:36:23] <Woet> Rockwood: what did you try so far?
[11:36:54] <Rockwood> still am looking at and confuse how to use it in my case
[11:37:04] <Woet> Rockwood: keep reading
[11:38:06] <AlbertoP> well I certainly know the feeling myself... the doc often assumes one knows already :)
[11:38:51] <Woet> yes, the jQuery docs assume you know the basics of javascript
[11:38:52] <Woet> which is a prerequisite of using jQuery
[11:39:05] <AlbertoP> that's not what I meant
[11:39:22] <Woet> not sure what you meant then
[11:39:25] <Woet> the jQuery docs are very good
[11:39:46] <AlbertoP> they are references, not actual docs to learn from
[11:40:12] <Woet> well, yea, they are not tutorials
[11:40:13] <Woet> you want https://learn.jquery.com for that
[11:40:25] <Rockwood> please dont confront :p
[11:40:37] <AlbertoP> lol
[11:40:47] <AlbertoP> just chatting, not really confronting
[11:43:51] <AlbertoP> Woet, agreed by the way. Jquery does a pretty good job compared to a lot of others.
[11:44:30] <Rockwood> AlbertoP, i m joking
[11:49:12] <Rockwood> Woet, in my case value will be hold by DOM
[11:49:27] <Woet> Rockwood: cool
[11:52:08] <Rockwood> Woet, wow thanks https://jsfiddle.net/d3L49obm/
[11:52:53] <Rockwood> Woet, is prefect way?
[11:53:04] <Woet> Rockwood: if you want an object of all data values, sure.
[11:53:12] <Woet> Rockwood: if you just want "data-value", nope - reread the docs.
[11:57:07] <Rockwood> Woet,  not getting your point correctly
[11:57:16] <Rockwood> mean not understand your meaning her e
[11:57:37] <Woet> thats okay.
[11:57:52] <Rockwood> workable?
[11:58:05] <Rockwood> or prefect as per my requirement
[11:58:22] <AlbertoP> Rockwood, do you want an object that contains all data-*, or do you want only data-values?
[11:59:11] <Rockwood> data-value is looks appropriate
[11:59:40] <AlbertoP> then your solution is too generic (it does the first thing)
[12:00:13] <Woet> Rockwood: why don't you look at the docs again? it tells you how to get specific data- elements.
[12:00:18] <Woet> attributes *
[12:00:24] <Rockwood> ah okay
[12:00:28] <Rockwood> got it
[12:00:38] <Rockwood> Woet, and AlbertoP thanks
[12:00:50] <Rockwood> and Xmas with whisky
[12:00:52] <Rockwood> :p
[12:01:00] * AlbertoP does not drink :P
[12:02:10] * Rockwood 's  suggestion is drinking is not harmful for health :p
[12:02:36] <Rockwood> enjoy you life as you can :D
[12:02:41] <Rockwood> your
[12:03:32] <AlbertoP> I don't enjoy being drunk
[12:21:06] <Rockwood> good night
