[00:00:34] <Stephen> oojacoboo: Here's some demo code thats used in Chrome. DOM Mutation Observers won't be in FF until 14
[00:00:35] <Stephen> http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/02/Detect-DOM-changes-with-Mutation-Observers
[00:01:35] <oojacoboo> Stephen, yea, that looks cross browser friendly :(
[00:01:49] <oojacoboo> WebKitMutationObserver :/
[00:02:00] <Stephen> Yeah. as I said, FF14
[00:02:07] <Stephen> You might look into this:
[00:02:07] <Stephen> https://code.google.com/p/mutation-summary/
[00:02:33] <zamn> arg
[00:02:33] <oojacoboo> FML
[00:02:41] <zamn> how can i make a unique id every time
[00:02:47] <zamn> whats a good approach to this
[00:03:04] <zamn> <div id="song title"></div> is a bad idea
[00:03:08] <zamn> since songs can start with numbers
[00:03:09] <oojacoboo> Stephen,  this doesn't seem as though it be all that uncommon of an event
[00:03:16] <oojacoboo> maybe I'm mistaken
[00:03:25] <zamn> and i need it to be an id otherwise i would use a class
[00:03:41] <zamn> since googles swfobject library only takes id's..
[00:04:40] <Stephen> oojacoboo: This event is often misused and a huge performance hog
[00:04:48] <oojacoboo> :/
[00:04:54] <Stephen> That's why it's getting the makeover
[00:05:05] <tw2113> one idea that may be worthwhile zamn
[00:05:09] <oojacoboo> how else can I check for a DOM object added though an autocomplete?
[00:05:17] <tw2113> use some sort of js rand function, assign that to a variable
[00:05:18] <oojacoboo> through*
[00:05:25] <tw2113> and use that variable everywhere you need it
[00:05:31] <zamn> tw2113: was thinking of using a rand
[00:05:41] <zamn> but there is still the possibility that the number gets drawn twice
[00:05:43] <zamn> heh
[00:05:47] <Stephen> oojacoboo: Did you write the code to insert the node/
[00:05:57] <oojacoboo> yes
[00:05:59] <tw2113> that's why you use it once and assign it to the variable
[00:06:15] <Stephen> Basically, wrap the autocomplete code in a Deferred
[00:06:17] <zamn> tw2113: but this is going to be happening 2000 times
[00:06:26] <oojacoboo> Stephen, true
[00:06:32] <oojacoboo> good idea, thanks
[00:06:32] <tw2113> in that case, dunno
[00:06:48] <Dipen> Hello guys
[00:09:49] <systemfault> zamn: What do you need to do?
[00:10:00] <zamn> systemfault: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/documentation
[00:10:09] <zamn> i need to be able to use swfobject.embed(blah);
[00:10:14] <zamn> but the first parameter only takes an id
[00:10:44] <zamn> and if you look at my DOM you will see id is usually set to song title
[00:10:49] <zamn> but since songs can start with numbers thats not valid
[00:11:03] <zamn> and i can't do <div id="video"></div>
[00:11:07] <zamn> cause you can only assign an id once
[00:11:14] <systemfault> zamn: I wouldn't be surprised if the function can take a DOM node
[00:11:16] <zamn> a class would be perfect for this situation but of course i can't use it
[00:11:27] <systemfault> zamn: Instead of a id
[00:11:59] <zamn> systemfault: im a js noob :x. how would i do that
[00:12:21] <zamn> do you mean document.getElementById(blarg) ?
[00:12:42] <systemfault> zamn: More or less, jquery is nothing special, it just 'wraps' DOM node
[00:13:09] <systemfault> zamn: So you simply need to get the good div with jquery then call .get(0) on it to get the DOM node
[00:13:11] <LoneStar99> this the following correct syntax --> $('.src-img').attr(src='yoo/img/btn-yho.png');
[00:13:20] <systemfault> LoneStar99: Not at all :P
[00:13:26] <LoneStar99> lol
[00:13:37] <LoneStar99> stupid ehow sucks
[00:13:41] <systemfault> $('.src-img').attr('src', 'yoo/img….')
[00:14:11] <LoneStar99> k
[00:14:24] <LoneStar99> do not use ehow to many adds and old information...
[00:14:32] <systemfault> Ah :(
[00:14:36] <systemfault> Sad
[00:15:32] <LoneStar99> thanks
[00:16:06] <oojacoboo> Stephen, you can also use on() with that event and $(this).off()
[00:16:10] <systemfault> zamn: What I would do is: change the whole id="Song title" to class="video"   and after.. I would pass: $(this).siblings('.video').get(0) as the second parameter to embedSWF
[00:16:11] <oojacoboo> although deprecated of course
[00:16:20] <zamn> systemfault: thats whatim doing right now
[00:16:45] <oojacoboo> I need to look into some deferreds though, just sucks b/c that's a global function that doesn't need a deferred for all method calls :/
[00:16:50] <systemfault> zamn: You're saying that you're a noob… but you understand quickly ;)
[00:17:01] <zamn> systemfault: heh, im not a noob programmer. Just a noob to javascript! :)
[00:17:33] <systemfault> zamn: Javascript was a bit difficult for me… because I'm a C++ programmer :/
[00:18:27] <zamn> systemfault: im a college student so my 'primary language' is java...but thats because i have tons and tons of experience with it. I'm writing ruby right now and doing web stuff with rails. I have written some games and such in C++.
[00:19:26] <systemfault> zamn: cool :)
[00:21:25] <rabbi1> $(.classname).focus(); will give me a focus to element ?
[00:24:34] <systemfault> zamn: I was looking for that DOM node thing..
[00:25:04] <systemfault> zamn: Seems that only SWFObject 2.3 Beta supports it… sucks..
[00:25:11] <zamn> heh
[00:25:13] <zamn> fucking youtube api
[00:25:15] <zamn> -_-
[00:25:45] <systemfault> zamn: So you're back to square one :( using IDs :'(
[00:26:09] <zamn> yep
[00:26:12] <zamn> and im sending them as strings
[00:26:15] <zamn> lolol
[00:26:42] <systemfault> Anyway… Just call the ids video-(some random number here)
[00:27:40] <zamn> well
[00:27:49] <zamn> there could be a million results
[00:27:58] <systemfault> Then you could do $(this).siblings('div[id^="video"]')
[00:28:01] <zamn> if i have vide-$rand(0, 10000000) or whatever
[00:28:06] <systemfault> Ahh
[00:28:16] <systemfault> You could use a counter instead then
[00:28:21] <tw2113> what are you going to be doing that will result in 1000s of results?
[00:28:22] <zamn> wow
[00:28:25] <zamn> how was i not thinking that
[00:28:29] <zamn> rofl
[00:28:58] <zamn> and then how would i get the div id as a string via jquery
[00:29:27] <systemfault> $(this).siblings('div[id^="video"]').attr('id')
[00:30:16] <systemfault> ^= means (start with)
[00:30:29] <zamn> heh was just about to google that
[00:31:44] <tw2113> problem solved
[00:32:48] <zamn> yeah
[00:32:51] <zamn> we're the JS-teaM!
[00:33:11] <systemfault> I… guess :P
[00:34:39] <tw2113> or just jQuery help channel
[00:34:58] <systemfault> Yeah :)
[00:39:27] <zamn> systemfault: im getting an undefined for what you gave me :p
[00:39:46] <systemfault> Can i see your code in action? :(
[00:40:29] <systemfault> (A jdfiddle or something)
[00:40:33] <systemfault> *jsfiddle
[00:41:35] <zamn> its okay
[00:41:42] <zamn> its a case of im-too-tired
[00:41:46] <zamn> and i didnt change the class to id
[00:42:06] <rabbi1> i have assingned set to elements to variable called var, if i have to set focus to the first element i have to use $('.classname').focus(var).first(); ?
[00:47:11] <zamn> rabbi1: i feel like you're from rails heh
[00:47:17] <zamn> .first()
[00:47:28] <zamn> rabbi1: are your elements in an array?
[00:49:16] <rabbi1> zamn: its jquery ui tabs
[00:51:18] <rabbi1> zamn: i am checking for error condition and if its true i need to change the focus to the second tab...
[00:51:58] <zamn> oh i can't help you unless i see the code
[00:51:59] <zamn> sorry
[00:52:19] <systemfault> I don't know anything about jquery ui as I hate it… but can't you just trigger a click even on the second tab?
[00:53:03] <systemfault> *event
[00:54:49] <rabbi1> systemfault: :) yeah, doing it. but y u hate jqui ?
[00:55:17] <systemfault> One word… uncustomizable.
[00:55:48] <systemfault> jQueryUi's architecture is too rigid
[00:56:36] <rabbi1> systemfault: hmmm, i don't know as i am still a learner. as of now using ui at a great deal :( never know when i will get bugged ...
[00:57:11] <systemfault> rabbi1: If the defaults or what themeroller provides is enough, good for you, jQueryUI is awesome
[00:57:57] <rabbi1> yeah, made lot of changes though on the css
[00:58:22] <systemfault> And messing with one widget messes up all the others..
[00:58:23] <systemfault> ]
[00:59:35] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah, felt difficult initially. now it's good enough, though not sure what's waiting for future ;)
[00:59:54] <systemfault> That's what a rigid system is...
[01:00:18] <rabbi1> systemfault: UI tab has a "selected" option which is numeric, can i pass a "var"  name in there?
[01:00:33] <systemfault> rabbi1: if var contains a number, sure
[01:00:34] <rabbi1> I felt this is far better than dojo
[01:00:46] <systemfault> I never used dojo so I cannot tell
[01:00:58] <rabbi1> systemfault: nope, it contains object how can i get the number ?
[01:01:26] <systemfault> I don't know.. depends on how it's done.
[01:01:43] <rabbi1> systemfault: 'var' has <div id='someting'></div> in it which is index of 1 in the tabs
[01:02:40] <systemfault> I don't know.. in some cases, depending on the markup, .index() on the node might be good enough
[01:02:51] <rabbi1> systemfault: .length will give the number ?
[01:03:07] <rabbi1> yeah, perfect .index() does
[01:03:09] <systemfault> .length gives the number of elements in the jquery object
[01:04:10] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah right, says .index is not a function, let me add give a moment
[01:04:44] <systemfault> Then perhaps you have a DOM node and not a jquery object, if that's the case $(var).index()
[01:05:29] <systemfault> Also.. I told you that I don't know a lot about jQueryUI
[01:06:30] <rabbi1> systemfault: i am doing this     var tabDivs = $('.tabDiv');  var editTab = tabDivs.index(); but as code is it's giving me the number of last tab
[01:06:48] <rabbi1> systemfault: :) got that
[01:42:52] <rabbi1> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1067338/  I am trying to select a tab on some condition, what is the correct technique ?
[02:06:22] <danielbeeke> I have a function with .on() see: http://pastebin.com/VeWZbHrc when using hasClass it looks like the function gete aan cached reply.. with firebug I see that the class is removed but hasClass still sees the old class.Also when logging with console it prints out the removed class
[02:11:49] <rabbi1> can anyone help me here http://paste.ubuntu.com/1067364/ ??
[02:19:52] <brrc> Hello, i'm using the gmaps plugin for jquery, but I'm using it in a toggled div, that start as display: none or hiden, and that makes the map to be out of place, I can show the real case example online
[02:23:03] <brrc> Can any one help with my problem with the gmaps plugin for jquery ?
[02:27:35] <titii> Hi friends, please can you help me to return true for submit AJAX response form? The alert result for false is ok, but on true I cant submit form. On true nothing heappens. Please check http://snipt.org/vkhf8. Thank you
[02:30:40] <platzhirsch> Is there a shorter way for $("#id").click(function () { $("id").doSomething(); } ); ?
[02:30:52] <platzhirsch> referencing the element to which the event was added
[02:34:19] <styol> platzhirsch: within the function callback try $(this)
[02:34:53] <craea> hello, can anyone tell me what's wrong with this --> http://jsfiddle.net/3eYH8/ ?? :>
[02:34:54] <Mar2u> hello everyone
[02:35:11] <titii> Some body can help me?
[02:35:23] <Mar2u> me to please
[02:35:32] <titii> :)
[02:35:40] <Mar2u> i try to make something like this
[02:35:49] <Mar2u> $(document).ready(delay(3000){
[02:35:51] <Mar2u> $('#form').show("fade", {}, 1000);});
[02:36:16] <Mar2u> can i make a delay event?
[02:36:40] <lordmortis> shouldn't you be using SetTimeout instead of delay?
[02:37:14] <Mar2u> i need to do 4 delay events
[02:37:28] <Mar2u> and dont work
[02:37:28] <styol> craea: perhaps a class would be better
[02:37:36] <brrc> Hello everyone, i'm having some trouble calling gmaps from display:none / hidden with gmaps plugin from jquery, when the map comes up it gets mispalced, -> http://www.denisewhitesotogrande.com/new/results.php (click on "View this selection of properties on a map")
[02:37:42] <platzhirsch> styol: thanks
[02:38:06] <Mar2u> is not for just one element
[02:38:17] <Mar2u> are diferite divs
[02:38:27] <lordmortis> Mar2u: okay? so after 3000 you want to do 4 things? or after various delays you want to do various things?
[02:38:49] <Mar2u> no only after 3sec
[02:39:05] <Mar2u> show hide move hide
[02:39:07] <lordmortis> so you want to: wait 3 seconds, then do 4 things ?
[02:39:14] <Mar2u> yes
[02:39:23] <lordmortis> okay
[02:39:27] <lordmortis> one option (which is what i'd do)
[02:39:34] <lordmortis> give me a sec.
[02:39:39] <titii> Some one can tell me why the submission on true ajax result form is not posted? http://snipt.org/vkhf8
[02:39:47] <Mar2u> ok thanks
[02:39:57] <titii> submition
[02:43:01] <systemfault> titii: You shouldn't be doing it with async: false.
[02:43:26] <systemfault> The callback don't make sense if you do it that way..
[02:43:51] <titii> so what to do? just remove the assync?
[02:44:07] <lordmortis> Mar2u: this should show you how to do what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/FUapF/1/
[02:44:23] <nicket> Anybody interested building a "simple" offer calculator script? PM me for more info and pricing.
[02:44:25] <Mar2u> thanks a lot
[02:44:56] <lordmortis> Mar2u: SetTimeout takes a function and a time as an argument, and runs that function after the specified time without blocking javascript execution
[02:45:03] <systemfault> titii: if you remove the async, returning true from a callback function doesn't make sense either.
[02:45:30] <Mar2u> cool
[02:45:31] <titii> systemfault: ok remove it out, but the sumbittion is still not precessed on true
[02:45:48] <Mar2u> i am a noob :)
[02:46:00] <Mar2u> thanks
[02:46:33] <titii> systemfault: But how it works?
[02:46:51] <systemfault> titii: I don't understand what you want to do.
[02:47:12] <systemfault> titii: I'm just telling you the parts that don't make sense or are just plain wrong.
[02:47:42] <titii> systemfault: this is validation for one field of form, and after true validation, simply submit form to server. As normall form posting
[02:47:58] <systemfault> Ah
[02:48:46] <systemfault> titii: Then what you need to do is remove the e.preventDefault() line from the top and add it as the "else" of inside the success callback
[02:49:34] <systemfault> titii: the e.preventDefault() does exactly what it says.. it prevents the default behavior which is to send the form to the server,.
[02:49:51] <systemfault> There's no 'return true'
[02:50:21] <systemfault> you success handler should be something like: if (result.snResult == false) { e.preventDefault() }
[02:50:26] <titii> systemfault: so instead of return true I chenge to e.preventDefault()? Right?
[02:50:55] <systemfault> titii: Not really, because you want to do e.preventDefault() only if the validation fails
[02:51:07] <systemfault> Ahhh
[02:51:22] <systemfault> And put back the async: false
[02:51:40] <systemfault> It's necessary for your specific case unless you send the form via ajax
[02:53:12] <systemfault> titii: something like that http://jsfiddle.net/aLe8z/
[02:54:20] <titii> systemfault: MMM, i trying to understand you, but not success at all, but I do to check your fiddle :\
[02:57:36] <titii> systemfault: This is still wrong :) If there is no error. The submission is not posted to server. Hmmm. It not make sense
[02:57:46] <systemfault> :(
[02:58:16] <platzhirsch> Let's say I want to clone an element with class x, when I clone it all elements are cloned. How can I restrict this to for instance the first class? Using [0] on the array doesn't work, the error says, DIVElement has no method clone()
[02:59:20] <systemfault> platzhirsch: [0] unwraps the jquery object, use .eq(0) instead
[02:59:37] <Whirl3d> [0] on a jquery object give s you the dom element. .eq(0) gives you the first item int he collection
[02:59:40] <titii> systemfault: http://snipt.org/vkhh2
[02:59:47] <Whirl3d> lol sorry sytemfault.
[02:59:50] <platzhirsch> systemfault: thanks a lot
[02:59:55] <platzhirsch> Whirl3d: you too
[03:00:03] <platzhirsch> although you were too slow
[03:00:10] <Whirl3d> amen. story of my life
[03:00:24] * platzhirsch comforts Whirl3d
[03:00:29] <Whirl3d> 8)
[03:01:06] <titii> systemfault: any idea friend?
[03:01:37] <systemfault> titii: unfortunately… without a way to test, no :'(
[03:02:21] <titii> systemfault: do you have skype? I can share my screen to show you
[03:03:20] <systemfault> No, I don't :/
[03:04:05] <Whirl3d> the .next() method only works on collections of 1 element? or just on the first element? or ...?
[03:21:55] <Whirl3d> so if I store a reference to a local array variable in an elements data object and then add items to the local array, it doesn't update the elements data object, does it?
[03:23:49] <Whirl3d> meaning that likewise, if I assign a local variable to an element's data object's attribute and then modify the local variable, I have to reassign  the new value to the element's data object
[03:29:43] <platzhirsch> How do I get all input fields from a jQuery selector? I have $("selector").children(":input"), but that gives me only the direct children, is there a short way to call this recursively for all child elements?
[03:34:56] <styol> platzhirsch: possibly $('selector input')
[03:36:11] <platzhirsch> styol: ah I can chain them of course
[03:36:50] <platzhirsch> or not
[03:37:06] <platzhirsch> .find(":input") works though
[03:37:20] <Nece228> hello
[03:37:25] <Nece228> im using replaceWith()
[03:37:37] <styol> platzhirsch: hrm 'selector input' should select all <input>'s within 'selector'
[03:38:29] <Nece228> but if i have e.g. "<input type="name">" and then do replaceWith('type="name2') then it changes it as a whole
[03:38:43] <Nece228> i want to change only the attribute which i have declared
[03:38:51] <Nece228> while not touching everything else
[03:40:37] <styol> Nece228: perhaps .attr('type', 'name2)
[03:41:15] <styol> Nece228: I forgot a ' at the end but yeah
[03:42:33] <Nece228> styol: well it works but thats not something what i need
[03:42:42] <Nece228> let me show you code example
[03:43:41] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/64085649
[03:44:05] <Nece228> you see i have messed up logics
[03:44:14] <Nece228> i need something else
[03:44:45] <Nece228> basically it should exchange the values of two inputs
[03:44:54] <Nece228> looking for the best way to do this
[03:49:32] <Whirl3d> you want to swap the two values?
[03:50:46] <Whirl3d> Nece228, don't make me run though the logs to find how many times you have been told that you can't have two eements with the same ID.
[03:50:50] <titii> Guys, please, I hope this is simple, but I am noob. I need normall submit to the server after form field validation. Check: http://snipt.org/vkhi7 - after validation success form is not posted to the server. Whats wrong?
[03:51:22] <Whirl3d> $("#productname") should only ever return one element regardless of whether it's in current or prev rows..
[03:52:04] <Nece228> Whirl3d: well let me say i replace it with classes so what next?
[03:54:12] <Whirl3d> you have prev and curr assigned to the two fields you want to swap.   var val=prev.val();   prev.val(curr.val()); curr.val(val);
[03:54:59] <Whirl3d> you store the value of one of the lements in a variable. and then (the one that you just stored the value from) gets replaced with the other...then the other gets the value  you stored in the variable.
[03:55:47] <Nece228> Whirl3d: yeah i understand that
[03:56:05] <Nece228> Whirl3d: ok thanks ill try. let me also ask is it good practice generally to name variables with dollar sign (e.g. $var)
[03:56:21] <Whirl3d> I hate that, personally.
[03:56:58] <Whirl3d> I have a hard time seeing the difference between $(element) and $element and $.element some times...it makes for more work for me
[03:57:26] <Nece228> one guy here said that its good practice so i started using that
[03:57:37] <Whirl3d> Plus, it's Hungarian in nature...lol which is frowned upon though there is argument about it. Personally I avoid it. Some foks like it.
[03:58:44] <Whirl3d> Part of what makes $ effective is that it stands out. cluttering your code with $variable names makes it no longer useful. You just as well use j
[03:59:45] <Whirl3d> I mean $ stands out in your code. Why repupose it for a label. You wouldnt do that with the letter a for example...
[04:00:23] <Whirl3d> and this holds extra true if $ == prototype or mootools or someone else is using it
[04:00:33] <Whirl3d> bah. $varname is bad. imho
[04:01:15] <Nece228> ok thanks for tips
[04:01:23] <Nece228> i guess i wont use it anymore
[04:01:32] <Whirl3d> Do what works for you..
[04:01:36] <Nece228> yesterday one programmer told me that you shouldnt use them
[04:01:48] <Nece228> and that freenode network is a bunch of inexperienced programmers
[04:01:50] <Nece228> :)
[04:02:53] <Whirl3d> Well, he is wrong about that. In fact, you will find folks on here that have written the core of jquery and contibute regularly to the very infrastructure of the web. Tell that nerd to get a clue.
[04:03:19] <Nece228> yeah im pretty sure hes wrong, but hes hostile generally
[04:03:47] <Whirl3d> people who are insecure (because they are full of shit) tend to be hostile like that.
[04:04:32] <Whirl3d> Hell, I get hostile when I am on shakey ground having to justify my reasoning, so it's not like we can't all relate.
[04:05:20] <Nece228> called me idiot programmer because of that swapping values thing. i understand that they way i did it was stupid, but i thought that when i save its value in a variable it gets saved only one time
[04:05:51] <Nece228> but it look like whenever i call that variables it always looks at the value
[04:06:00] <Umren> Nece228, did you tried to kick him in the nuts?
[04:06:16] <Nece228> nah, hes more experienced than me
[04:06:25] <Nece228> almost decade of experience as i know
[04:06:41] <Umren> Yep, but calling other people idiots, especially if you work with then is kinda bad
[04:06:47] <Umren> *them
[04:06:48] <Whirl3d> Think of it like this: variables store data until they are overwritten , deleted or until they no longer have scope..
[04:08:18] <Whirl3d> so when you say var x=50;   as long as you have access to "x", it will stay 50 unless you change it. It's not like you store it like a glass of water and then pour that water into another cup...emptying the first cup.
[04:09:38] <Nece228> thanks for tips
[04:09:57] <Whirl3d> np. Just make sure you fix that id problem.
[04:10:04] <Nece228> i will
[04:10:17] <Nece228> but theres a little problem about that
[04:10:32] <Nece228> some of the inputs already have a class
[04:10:53] <Whirl3d> you can have multiple classes on an element
[04:11:01] <Nece228> multiple classes?
[04:11:04] <Nece228> thats cool then
[04:12:27] <Whirl3d> lots of times you will have a class for the styling of the element, a logic state, etc.   so   <input clas='hidden green embossed autoenter' /> is valid. Then you could styl it green, embossed and hidden.
[04:13:19] <Whirl3d> and use the autoenter class to indicate the specific type of input ...separate from type='select' for example...
[04:14:06] <Whirl3d> another way to approach this would be to store data in the element's data object.
[04:14:51] <Whirl3d> by using $("elem").data("productName", "dildo"), you store it in  a jquery-accessible variable
[04:15:09] <Nece228> damn :D
[04:15:39] <Nece228> lets hope i wont work in project which will sell dildos
[04:15:57] <Whirl3d> You can also use the data-prefixed attributes like $("elem").attr('data-productName","dildo") and jquery can access it through $('elen').data('productName");
[04:16:15] <Whirl3d> I dunno, it made anusx4 a rich man on here.
[04:18:43] <Nece228> :D
[04:18:54] <Nece228> you have a huge imagination sir
[04:23:42] <Savuud> Hello, I am having some problems getting a custom event to bubble up the DOM chain. Any good documentation out there?
[04:24:21] <Savuud> I can get normal events like "click" and such to bubble, but not my custom events.
[04:25:41] <Savuud> this should be like the easiest thing to do.. but I'm stuck and it's propably just caused by a small thing.. kinda frustrating
[04:26:12] <Whirl3d> Savuud, custom events don't bubble
[04:26:23] <Savuud> err
[04:26:45] <Savuud> why on earth is that?
[04:26:55] <Whirl3d> Why should they?
[04:27:04] <Whirl3d> what event are you wanting to bubble?
[04:27:35] <Whirl3d> now if you mean native event, custom handler...that's different...
[04:28:35] <Savuud> I wan't to let X elements in the DOM tree be aware that a JSON string has been stored on a DOM element.
[04:29:11] <Savuud> So I was thinking I could solve this by firing of a new jQuery.Event object and then let it bubble up the DOM tree
[04:29:42] <Savuud> So everyone interested in knowing about this event.. could subscribe to it..
[04:29:43] <Whirl3d> what you would do is setup handlers to handle the event.
[04:29:56] <Whirl3d> you can do that with bind an trigger.
[04:30:07] <Whirl3d> but that's different than bubbling
[04:30:08] <Savuud> But I don't know the name of the node element in advance that triggers the event
[04:30:25] <Savuud> If I would, I could skip the whole bubbling problem
[04:30:35] <Whirl3d> then have the node element triger an event on a known element
[04:30:49] <Savuud> But I need the event.target
[04:31:04] <Whirl3d> where is the value being asigned?
[04:31:06] <Savuud> ok, thanks m8.. I'll get back to the drawing board :)
[04:32:01] <Whirl3d> probably in a json request success handler. So bind an event to the success handler on a parent element and have it trigger a custom event like "MYKIDGOTJSONED"
[04:32:47] <Whirl3d> You could also use the $.Callbacks() object to bind multiple callbacks to the same JSON success handler.
[04:32:53] <Savuud> Whirl3d: Good suggestion, makes a lot of sense.. I'll try that :)
[04:36:26] <tdskate> hey for some reasons setting height on a iFrame in IE8 doesn't work, setting other css properties works perfectly ...
[04:36:38] <tdskate> what am i doing wrong ?
[04:37:11] <tdskate> oh no, wait a second
[04:37:22] <tdskate> ignore everything i said :p
[04:47:33] <coldhead> good job, tdskate. CASE CLOSED
[04:56:27] <titii> How can stop submission form in a .submit() instead of e.preventDefault(); ? Because there should be a bug. I have a condition if and else. I use e.preventDefault(); in if, and this works also in else :\
[05:02:00] <coldhead> that sounds like a bug in your code, titii
[05:02:05] <coldhead> it shouldn't do that
[05:02:12] <coldhead> can you paste your code somewhere?
[05:02:38] <titii> coldhead: http://snipt.org/vkhi7
[05:04:00] <titii> coldhead: I am comnfused. I dint it other way. And there the same problem :( I am confused. Check http://snipt.org/vkhj1
[05:05:52] <coldhead> titii: maybe your conditional is wrong?
[05:06:54] <coldhead> titii: i would try a statement like this just inside the start of success:
[05:06:57] <coldhead> console.log(result, result.snResult, result.snResult != true);
[05:07:44] <coldhead> oh you know what?
[05:07:52] <coldhead> this ajax thing is going to run in the background
[05:08:04] <coldhead> the submit() handler will finish before success even runs
[05:08:25] <coldhead> i would expect the form to submit in either case
[05:08:42] <coldhead> i think you have to preventDefault BEFORE the .ajax call
[05:08:55] <coldhead> and then do the submission manually in the success callback as required
[05:09:08] <coldhead> with form.submit()
[05:09:48] <titii> coldhead: I did it right as you write. But MSIE - Maxthon frozen... But in mozilla it works
[05:09:50] <titii> :(
[05:10:58] <titii> coldhead: Maybe I can try to check ion original MSIE, not in maxthon (this is tabbed browser with using msie engine)
[05:11:55] <coldhead> good luck titii
[05:11:56] <titii> coldhead: maybe the problem is I executing submit( in submit( ... what you thing? hmm
[05:12:06] <coldhead> yes it could be, titii
[05:12:08] <titii> or not?
[05:12:25] <titii> coldhead: thank you all the way
[05:12:32] <titii> brb
[05:13:08] <coldhead> titii: i don't understand why you are doing AJAX *and* a form submit
[05:13:15] <coldhead> why don't you just do it all with AJAX
[05:14:03] <titii> coldhead: you mean post fields by ajax too?
[05:14:41] <coldhead> yes titii
[05:14:54] <coldhead> then you don't have to worry about the submit
[05:15:08] <coldhead> you can just do ONE request that sends all the data
[05:15:21] <coldhead> and if the server finds a problem you can report it right away
[05:15:26] <coldhead> otherwise everything is good!
[05:16:22] <titii> coldhead: I know, but its complicated related to the system. I have posting validation on the server. But the client wants one field validation with ajax :( this is special syntax
[05:17:20] <coldhead> i understand, titii
[05:17:21] <titii> coldhead: I understand you friend. But this is requirements...
[05:17:23] <coldhead> clients are crazy
[05:17:29] <titii> yes
[05:18:32] <titii> coldhead: But I am nervous because it looks simply thing :) you know
[05:19:11] <titii> but no! there must be some real problem :)
[05:22:55] <coldhead> titii: http://pastebin.com/88ihGfMn
[05:23:02] <coldhead> that is how i would try to do it
[05:23:06] <coldhead> it might have bugs
[05:23:14] <coldhead> but it might work :)
[05:23:22] <titii> coldhead: Im gonna look
[05:23:25] <coldhead> see if you can understand how it works
[05:23:29] <coldhead> good luck!
[05:25:59] <titii> coldhead: yea now i am trying to understand
[05:33:36] <rabbi1> how can i get the content of the url and change the UI tab on some condition on the url ?
[05:33:56] <titii> coldhead: it works man!!! :) k+
[05:34:43] <titii> so the $form.addClass('valid').trigger('submit'); agains this submission. Nice
[05:35:52] <lewq> Hi all.  Has anyone seen any issues with jQuery 1.6.4 on Chrome 19 and 20, where it intermittently throws exceptions like: Object #<Object> has no method 'children'?
[05:36:21] <lewq> The same code works perfectly in Firefox, and Chrome 17
[05:37:09] <coldhead> rabbi1: window.location.href
[05:37:11] <lewq> Why would a jQuery object not have the jQuery methods yet?
[05:37:24] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[05:37:33] <lewq> It feels like an issue with the ready handler firing too soon
[05:37:53] <rabbi1> coldhead: yeah, that will give me the url, but i have to find if the url contain 'something'
[05:38:06] <rabbi1> and then selecct the desired tab
[05:38:26] <coldhead> rabbi1: if (window.location.href.match(/aidsaidsaids.com/))
[05:38:54] <lewq> I'm also getting "Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined" coming out of jQuery 1.6.4 line 4635, in the makeArray function:  results.push.apply( results, array )
[05:38:54] <coldhead> lewq: there was someone asking about a similar bug a couple of days ago
[05:39:06] <coldhead> they had a chromium bug ticket for it
[05:39:19] <coldhead> it works okay in other browsers, right?
[05:39:31] <lewq> coldhead, cool - any idea what the ticket number was?  It's a tricky one to search for
[05:39:41] <coldhead> i can't remember, i'm sorry
[05:39:45] <lewq> coldhead, yeah, it's fine in FF
[05:39:45] <rabbi1> coldhead: that would check the content inside/ inbetween the url ?
[05:39:50] <coldhead> let me see if i can find it in the logs, lewq
[05:39:54] <lewq> coldhead, thank you!
[05:40:09] <coldhead> rabbi1: that will match a string anywhere in the URL
[05:40:21] <coldhead> 'google.com'.match(/oo/)
[05:41:12] <rabbi1> coldhead: o great, brb then :)
[05:42:09] <coldhead> lewq: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=125148
[05:45:42] <lewq> coldhead, thank you so much :-)
[05:45:48] <lewq> I'll try that workaround
[05:46:07] <coldhead> good luck lewq
[05:48:42] <rabbi1> coldhead: thanks, now i got two variable stored, now i have to check for true, true conditiona and select a tab bydefault and true, false condition and display another tab
[05:51:27] <coldhead> rabbi1: you have to check the docs for the tabs, i can't remember how they work
[05:52:37] <rabbi1> coldhead: yeah right .... going through. it's too many types of conditions i need to work on :(
[05:53:06] <coldhead> rabbi1: if you paste what you come up with here, people might help you clean it up
[05:55:06] <rabbi1> coldhead: ooo, its log of code, u know.. got it step by step, with the help of this irc, like i have tab validation, hide show of div on the tabs, tab for view records and addin records and editin records, ;) uff, will try to post it soon....
[05:56:06] <rioch> ${"table#tasks tr") in firebug shows [tr#1, tr#2, tr#3], $("table#tasks tr#3") shows [tr#3], but $("table#tasks tr#1") shows []. Why is that?
[05:57:19] <coldhead> i don't know why exactly, rioch, but you numbers are not valid for IDs
[05:57:50] <rioch> coldhead: really? They can't contain numbers at all, or just can't begin with them?
[05:57:55] <coldhead> you need to start with some other character
[05:57:58] <kurol> i think they changed that rule for html5
[05:58:03] <kurol> but it's still a bad idea
[05:58:14] <rioch> ok. that's probably the reason then. Let me try.
[05:58:20] <coldhead> yes html5 lets you do anything pretty much
[05:58:30] <kurol> what a slut
[05:58:50] <coldhead> you love it
[06:00:40] <coldhead> http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/html5-id-class
[06:01:31] <kurol> troll developer... uses unicode for ids
[06:03:15] <coldhead> europeans, man
[06:03:35] <coldhead> i am going to sleep, good people. best of luck for your endeavours
[06:04:11] <rioch> coldhead: I was using html5, but my id's weren't unique. I added a prefix. Thanks.
[06:26:45] <tdskate> why does this not work?   var frame = $('<iframe>').extend({ somefunction:function(){} }).appendTo('body');    frame.somefunction();
[06:37:31] <Whirl3d> ?.extend
[06:39:08] <Whirl3d> extend extends objects, not html elements....?
[06:42:51] <minijupe> I'm trying to check all checkboxes in a div but I'm failing. Not so good at jquery. Should this work: $('#uqjuo2_3 input').each(function(x){x.checked})
[06:43:38] <Whirl3d> x.checked?
[06:44:43] <Whirl3d> basically, what that sentence reads like is "select all of the input boxes inside Uquiu... and then cycle through each of them and
[06:44:46] <Whirl3d> apples
[06:44:56] <Whirl3d> there's no verb in the sentece
[06:46:57] <Whirl3d> x.checked is not a function as it takes no paramteres. If you wanted to turn all the checkboxes to "checked" state, you would $("#uqiuo2_3 input:checkbox").prop("checked",true);
[06:49:14] <Whirl3d> Is everyone busy watching Saturday morning cartoons or something? Do they even have Saturday Morning Cartoons any more?
[06:51:05] <dan> hey guys  i use jq 1.7.2 and i have a textarea , when document ready i coded to detect text chance on it with $.change() , and it gets fired only when mouse out , that is weird - how do i fix it ?
[06:51:33] <Whirl3d> dan, it should only get fired when the element loses focus
[06:51:54] <dan> that is not a change event :9
[06:52:02] <Whirl3d> either by tabbing out or mouse out or programmatically. THe change event only fires when the value changes
[06:52:24] <Whirl3d> you have to commit the change or it's not a valid change
[06:52:30] <dan> i want the detection to work while maintaining focus
[06:52:40] <Whirl3d> check for keypress
[06:53:08] <dan> i used keyup but  i am working on unicode text - so keyup is not practical
[06:53:24] <Whirl3d> di d you try keypress?
[06:53:31] <dan> yes
[06:53:53] <Whirl3d> and you compared the value of the text field to it's old value?
[06:54:04] <Whirl3d> or you tried to interpret the keypress event?
[06:54:26] <dan> i dont get any value because unicode chars get inserted from another app so keypress event is not working with it
[06:54:36] <Whirl3d> cause checking the value for changes is better in your case. Otherwise tab would register a change
[06:55:05] <dan> detecting value changes is the best option for me
[06:55:06] <dan> :D
[06:55:17] <Whirl3d> right. on keypress
[06:55:31] <Whirl3d> or if it changes programmatically, you need to manually fire an event
[06:55:58] <Whirl3d> or setup a timer that repeatedly checks for a changed value, but that sux
[06:57:32] <dan> timers sux
[06:57:35] <dan> eat memory
[07:04:34] <Patrik2> Hey guys, this doesn't seem to work. Can anyone see what the problem might be? http://pastebin.com/2vPuvf2y
[07:09:36] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, before anyone is going to look at your problem, you are most likely going to have to explain what the problem is first.
[07:12:51] <Patrik2> Whirl3d, well, the problem is, nothing is happening when clicking the divs with the assigned id:s, therefore I was wondering if I had done something wrong when assigning the array or something similar. I was hoping that someone when looking at my code would detect a misspelling or similar.
[07:14:00] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, jquery is a function that selects items.
[07:15:12] <Whirl3d> so select your items, then apply your function...   like $("#section-header, #section-content, #section-footer").click(function () { do stuff")) and it will assign the click handler to all of them
[07:15:46] <Patrik2> Ok, that was an easier approach!
[07:16:00] <Whirl3d> It's kind of weird to create an array of jquery objects...
[07:16:47] <Whirl3d> Let jquery do the work for you.
[07:17:01] <Patrik2> Ok, well, I started with jQuery last day, that's why my approach seemed a bit weird.
[07:17:33] <Whirl3d> you could technically even get away with $("[id~='section-']").click(......
[07:17:42] <Whirl3d> np, that's why I was telling you
[07:18:32] <Patrik2> $("[id~='section-']") gives me all objects with id starting with section?
[07:18:57] <Whirl3d> sorry, it's ^='section-"     I just looked it up
[07:19:26] <Whirl3d> id^="section-"]     will give you all ids starting with section, for example.
[07:24:44] <paladinn> rtfm
[07:27:42] <mintux> I have this code http://jsbin.com/ekiqam/edit#source it's for a zoom software its here http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/imagepanner.htm  I want to have access to zoomfunct from outside of this script. actually I want to call zoomfunct from outside in this script it called by this line this.zoomfunct($, $img, s)
[07:29:21] <Patrik2> Hmm, well, the approach I tried isn't working. I'm trying to do when you click outside the page you get redirected, but I'm unsure how to do this... something like when clicking div that is not the page you get redirected.
[07:30:45] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, there's a plugin for click outside, but it's not gonna fire if someon clicks outside the browser window
[07:31:55] <Patrik2> whirl3d , well, I only want it to be launched when clicking in the browser but outside the divs with .zone . Where can I find that plugin?
[07:32:26] <Whirl3d> well, I would just handle the click event on the document
[07:33:36] <Whirl3d> $(document.).on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); var zonePiece=tag.closest('#section"); if (!zonePiece.length) {window.location=} });
[07:33:48] <Whirl3d> *targ
[07:34:41] <geekbuntu> Whirl3d, clever.
[07:34:51] <Whirl3d> so that basically says: Document, listen to for the click event. Find it's target and then find the closest ("containing") section to the target. If it exists, do nothing, if it doesn't exist, change the url
[07:35:26] <Whirl3d> ty, geekbuntu
[07:35:51] <Patrik2> Whirl3d, hmm, I'm trying to understand the code..  What's the "e"?
[07:36:11] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, e is the jquery event that gets passed with click.
[07:36:40] <Whirl3d> if you look at e (by doing a console.log(e) inside a click handler, there's all kinds of information passed with it
[07:36:47] <Whirl3d> include the event.target
[07:38:39] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, if this is your second day with jquery, are you familiar with Chrome Developer's tools or Firebug? You will need those to get any insight into what's happening with your code..
[07:39:00] <Patrik2> Yeah, I'm using firebug..
[07:39:12] <Whirl3d> cool. Are you familiar with jsfiddle?
[07:39:38] <Patrik2> That I am not.
[07:40:04] <Whirl3d> you should check it out. It's a javascript sandbox that is really useful for troubleshooting and for experimenting
[07:40:12] <Whirl3d> ? jsfiddle
[07:40:13] <Patrik2> Ok, I
[07:40:18] <Patrik2> will check it out
[07:40:27] <Whirl3d> hmmm bot-t is on vaca I see...
[07:41:24] <Patrik2> But I am not getting the code you wrote to work...  Is it supposed to be $(document.).on("click", ?
[07:42:34] <Whirl3d> yeah....lemme try it in a fiddle
[07:43:08] <sonnie> hey, i know how to append text to <a></a> using onLoad event. but how about .load()? my aim is to append text when a DIV is loaded.
[07:46:24] <skylamer`> steam talks videos from the conf of jquery?
[07:48:06] <Patrik2> Whirl3d, ok I thought I found the first problem. I'm using Drupal, and it isn't allowing the use of "$", instead you need to use jQuery, but it's still not working. I might have explained it wrong...
[07:52:02] <ecksit> I have the datepicker ui in a project. has anyone used it to set the value + 1 for another field?
[07:53:36] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Sef2v/10/
[07:54:00] <Whirl3d> ?.load @ sonnie
[07:54:09] <Whirl3d> bot-t is off again...
[07:54:47] <Whirl3d> sonnie, assig a callback to the load event using the syntax $("elem").load(url, callback);
[07:55:27] <Patrik2> whirl3d, nice! I think I'll manage it from now! Thanks for your help!
[07:55:36] <Whirl3d> np
[08:00:42] <Patrik2> It's still not working... The "document", is that everything? So when clicked anywhere it gets the target, and if that anything is outside of the #section 's length, the code is launched?
[08:00:47] <Patrik2> whirl3d
[08:11:49] <Whirl3d> the length value is the number of elements in the jquery object
[08:12:18] <Whirl3d> because jquery returns an empty collection (rather than an error or undefined), you have to check for length
[08:13:25] <Patrik2> Whirl3d, aaah. I see. But the on click function doesn't seem to be processed. I tried just adding an alert("test") inside the function processed on the click, and it isn't showing...
[08:14:49] <ecksit> how would I get the onSelect method to set the value of another field in this snippet? https://gist.github.com/1141659dd5973f4eb59e
[08:19:34] <javalover> I have a problem with loading times
[08:19:42] <javalover> my site has a lot of images it's loading & it takes too long
[08:19:51] <javalover> what are ways to improve the speed of loading images on a layout?
[08:21:53] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, do you have something else that is intercepting the click event?
[08:22:53] <Whirl3d> optimize your images
[08:24:22] <Whirl3d> a good compression algorthym like the one used in proJPG for Photoshop can save as much as 60% of your filesize with nearly unnoticable effect on your images. Of course, they don't make it any more, but there are other compression tools that will work.
[08:24:29] <Whirl3d> Or you could do lazy loading..
[08:24:41] <Whirl3d> only load the pictures as you need them
[08:25:30] <Whirl3d> ecksit, in the onSelect function handler, simply select the field whose value you want to change and change it using .val() most likely.
[08:25:50] <ecksit> Sorted thanks Whirl3d. altField also worked.
[08:25:52] <Patrik2> Whirl3d, I don't know...
[08:26:29] <Whirl3d> Patrik2, try the same thing with the mousedown event rather than click
[08:26:57] <tintin> HI,
[08:27:04] <tintin> Why is this not working? $("#id_button_ajax").click(function() {
[08:27:22] <tintin> I just did, alert("hello world");
[08:27:24] * Whirl3d consults the magic ball....
[08:28:36] <Whirl3d> perhaps you aren't selecting the right thing. Perhaps there's another item on top of it that is handling the click events. Spelling error in your selector, Maybe you meant class selector, not id selector...I could go on, but I think you get the point.
[08:29:08] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3024251
[08:29:26] <tintin> <input type="button" name="submit" id="id_button_ajax" value="Submit" />
[08:30:02] <Whirl3d> are you trying to intercept the submit event?
[08:30:20] <Patrik2> whirl3d, Well, if I'm having the hierarchy like so: html, body, div#section, div.zone.  I'm selecting zone with jQuery(".zone")... Ehm...
[08:30:54] <Whirl3d> Patrik2 do you have all of your jquery run in a Document.ready function?
[08:31:05] <Patrik2> ... Thanks.
[08:31:08] <Whirl3d> $(document).ready(function () {  do stuff});
[08:32:27] <Patrik2> Still not working... Hm, this is getting interesting...
[08:32:30] <Whirl3d> tintin, it works fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Sef2v/11/
[08:32:55] <Whirl3d> sry....jquery(document).ready(....
[08:33:11] <Patrik2> Yeah, I'm using it
[08:33:19] <Patrik2> Big Q or small?
[08:33:28] <Whirl3d> Big Q I think
[08:33:34] <Patrik2> Y...
[08:33:38] <Patrik2> Hmm..
[08:33:51] <Whirl3d> post your exact code word for word in a fiddle and letme see
[08:34:54] <Patrik2> http://pastebin.com/VjWD5ybu
[08:35:53] <Whirl3d> is it possible that zone is taking up all your space?
[08:36:17] <Whirl3d> in your click handler change line 4 to console.log(e);
[08:36:32] <Whirl3d> then look at the resulting object and see what is  being clicked.
[08:36:45] <Patrik2> No, I've checked. But I think the problem starts earlier, I added 'alert("test");' after the if argument, and that isn't loaded when clicked anywhere
[08:37:53] <Patrik2> ok
[08:37:54] <Patrik2> Ill look
[08:38:47] <Patrik2> jQuery(document).on is not a function
[08:39:11] <Whirl3d> change .on("clicked" t o   .bind(
[08:39:36] <Patrik2> .bind(function(e) ?
[08:39:53] <Whirl3d> .bind("click", funciton (e)
[08:41:04] <Patrik2> Works better. "q.replace" is not a function. ... Dont know what that means though.
[08:41:42] <Whirl3d> try this:  $(document).click(function (e) {.....
[08:43:11] <Patrik2> same error
[08:43:58] <Whirl3d> what line number
[08:44:42] <Patrik2> Hmm, it's not in the same file. It redirects to the jquery.js?v=1.4.4 . Is that outdated?
[08:44:54] <Whirl3d> yep
[08:45:10] <Patrik2> Ok, I'll do an update.
[08:45:19] <slon__> Where can we view the recordings of the jquery conf?
[08:45:55] <Hornet> is there a way to get the html() of the current element, not just the contents?
[08:46:05] <tintin> data: "query="+qry, is this correct for .ajax
[08:46:27] <Hornet> eg <div id=foo><p>asd</p></div> $(foo).html() gives you the P only, not the div
[08:47:12] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3024298 , is this correct syntax for data?
[08:47:27] <Patrik2> Whirl3d, c.replace is not a function, different line, but almost same error.
[08:47:31] <tintin> Or should it be in this way? data: { name: "John", location: "Boston" }
[08:49:43] <Patrik2> whirl3d, it doesn't like the : var sect = targ.closest(jQuery(".zone"));
[08:50:19] <Whirl3d> try .closest(".zone");
[08:51:22] <Patrik2> That did it!
[08:51:44] <ecksit> My autocomplete doesn't seem to be running correctly. https://gist.github.com/ba26076caa5343631098
[08:51:52] <Patrik2> whirl3d, thanks for your help
[08:52:03] <ecksit> Nothing seems to be populating.
[08:52:06] <Whirl3d> np
[08:55:59] <javalover> is there a way to say like "on image load, load next image"
[08:57:25] <Whirl3d> yes
[08:57:37] <osada> .load handler ?
[08:57:59] <Whirl3d> sequential loading
[08:58:13] <Whirl3d> ala googles will be your best bet for right now....
[09:00:30] <slon__> Will the recordings of the jquery conf be posted anywhere?
[09:08:19] <ecksit> here are the three files in question - https://gist.github.com/2f236e8d60afd2c63e2c . Autocomplete is b0rked.
[09:15:49] <Patrik2> whirl3d, do you think I can do a similar thing to change the cursor to a pointer?

[09:45:32] <skylamer`>  ecksit... show example
[09:45:45] <ecksit> ah, righ
[09:47:01] <ecksit> http://jsfiddle.net/JpjkX/
[09:47:16] <Nece228> how to validate if selector exists?
[09:47:37] <skylamer`> just ur links to the scripts r wrong
[09:48:29] <skylamer`> look at the dev console, there are lot of errors
[09:48:41] <skylamer`> put from the panel of left "add resources the right things" :)
[09:48:42] <ecksit> they all work locally.
[09:49:33] <ecksit> the only error I get is
[09:49:33] <ecksit> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[09:50:00] <ecksit> even loading from the cdn doesn't work
[09:50:18] <skylamer`> u write it wrong ...
[09:50:21] <skylamer`> its different
[09:50:25] <skylamer`> the selector is "destination"
[09:50:29] <skylamer`> and in jquery ure writing
[09:50:33] <skylamer`> $("#destinaton")
[09:50:55] <skylamer`> be sure to that element first exist before doing such things... :)
[09:51:49] <ecksit> changed those but nothing fixed
[09:55:44] <ecksit> I am now loading everything from the cdn and that error went but it still doesn't pop up.
[09:57:14] <skylamer`> just dive some deep in the devtools and debug a bit :)

[10:36:33] <ecksit> I am willing to pay for someone to fix this autocomplete issue for me. PM me your price as I need it ASAP.
[10:39:47] <ravenzz> ecksit #css-lance
[10:40:01] <ecksit> even if it is jquery?
[10:40:22] <ravenzz> yah
[10:40:33] <ravenzz> but what is the problem there?
[10:41:32] <ecksit> I can get my autocomplete working with a defined array of items however I cannot for the life of me get it to use an external json file instead.
[10:46:33] <ecksit> gah! even $.getJSON is failing.
[10:49:08] <ravenzz> did you read the examples on the jqueryui website?
[10:54:46] <ecksit> I did. How would I go about getting the contents of a json file and storing that data in a variable to use?
[10:56:13] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/JpjkX/5/
[10:57:27] <ravenzz> if you need to get the data throught a request
[10:57:36] <ravenzz> the source should be an anonymous function
[10:58:37] <ecksit> thanks. I need the json in it's own file though.
[10:58:46] <ravenzz> sure
[10:58:52] <ravenzz> hold on
[11:02:02] <Exx2xxO> hey people once again I've got a problem with a post request. The problem is: js stops working after the post request is done...and I still don't know how to solve it. Can anyone help please?
[11:02:04] <Exx2xxO> http://jsbin.com/ufeweb/edit#javascript
[11:07:07] <rabbi1> can i make an position: absolute element to display only on the active tab ?
[11:07:33] <Munawwar> hi all
[11:09:16] <Munawwar> want to make an animation with certain constaints...want an object moving at a certain velocity and then instantly stop when it tried to go out of a certain area
[11:09:50] <Munawwar> tries*
[11:10:08] <javalover> ok i need to talk to a genius
[11:10:17] <javalover> 1 sec
[11:11:51] <rabbi1> can i make an position: absolute element to display only on the active tab ?
[11:12:52] <ravenzz> ecksit the example on the jqueryui website is the one you are looking for
[11:13:01] <ravenzz> anyway what error you get?
[11:17:36] <ecksit> https://gist.github.com/776dca9d20e3992d2005 ravenzz
[11:18:00] <ravenzz> you need to return the value as weel
[11:18:02] <ravenzz> well
[11:18:54] <ravenzz> but if the ajax request returns the object you pasted on github
[11:19:05] <ravenzz> you can return data.destinations
[11:19:12] <ravenzz> no need to map the data obj
[11:25:05] <javalover> ok so here is my question
[11:25:20] <javalover> actually nevermind imma just try my own method
[11:28:49] <Exx2xxO> so there is no one who can help me with my problem ?
[11:31:56] <brentmulligan> question, if I could use  .live("click" ... to bind events to an object that may not exist on the DOM at load time or could be remove and then added back on, whats the equivalent of doing that now? I was trying with .on("click" .. but that doesn't seem to bind to future objects.
[11:34:55] <skylamer`> brentmulligan, first apply it with the some parent element
[11:35:01] <skylamer`> and right after the event handler option
[11:35:17] <skylamer`> "click", "write the elements u wish that to be executed", function(){}
[11:37:11] <brentmulligan> I am not sure I follow. Basically, I have a draggable element. User clicks that element, the span holding the text and removed and an input field is insert, on blur I remove the input field and replace it with the span holding the new text from the input field.
[11:38:02] <brentmulligan> My current problem is that I can't do it more than once without using .live("click" and .live("blur" which I read is deprecated
[11:39:34] <Exx2xxO> with this .live() method is there any option to say something like 'post method success' so javascript executes a function after a successfull post request?
[11:43:13] <SCD[Eire]> Hey have an odd question which nobody I know can seem to answer
[11:43:27] <SCD[Eire]> Is this the correct place to ask it or is there a questions channel?
[11:47:23] <shoky> that IS an odd question
[11:47:37] <shoky> ?ask @ SCD[Eire]
[11:47:38] <bot-t> SCD[Eire], If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:48:29] <SCD[Eire]> shoky: lol k
[11:49:59] <SCD[Eire]> So I have a php file, lets call it index.php. This file sets 3 variables and includes 3 html files (header,body,footer). The three php variables set in index are displayed in the body. When I submit a form via ajax I use the .load() function to reload the body html on success. However the PHP variables break and dont show up when I do this. Anyone have an idea or a similar problem?
[11:51:14] <Kambfhase> so you are trying to override values by reloading the body? sounds crazy
[11:51:43] <SCD[Eire]> Kambfhase: more like I'm trying to update the php variables without having to doa a page reload
[11:53:00] <Kambfhase> are these php-variables just plain html?
[11:53:37] <SCD[Eire]> Kambfhase: something like <h2><?php echo $statistic_one; ?></h2>
[11:53:55] <Kambfhase> hm, that should work. :o
[11:54:30] <shoky> Exx2xxO: don't use .live . you are doing exactly what .live does anyway with how you're using .on
[11:54:33] <Kambfhase> you could try disbing chaching
[11:55:03] <SCD[Eire]> Kambfhase: when the file was called body.html the php variables with literally echo as their name. So I'd get <h2>statistic_one</h2>. I changed it to body.php and it just displays nothing
[11:58:00] <Exx2xxO> shoky hmm but the script stops working after the post method in the typeItem function and I can't find a way how to solve this :/  thats why I thought about the .live() function
[11:58:03] <Kambfhase> sounds more like a php issue
[11:58:16] <shoky> Exx2xxO:  "stops working" ?
[11:58:54] <Exx2xxO> yeah I mean it reveives the answer from the server and then stops executing.. so like there is nothing else to do..
[11:59:09] <shoky> the .post success callback isn't called?
[11:59:51] <shoky> eh
[12:00:12] <shoky> Exx2xxO: i see you have code following the $.post which seems to depend on the post results.. right?
[12:00:19] <Exx2xxO> right
[12:00:32] <shoky> that code needs to only be executed when the post is successful, right?
[12:00:36] <Exx2xxO> right
[12:00:46] <shoky> so put it in the success callback.
[12:01:25] <shoky> otherwise that code will be run at ~the same time the post request is just being sent
[12:01:32] <shoky> ajax is asynchronous
[12:01:47] <Exx2xxO> okay I'll try :D
[12:01:53] <shoky> ;]
[12:04:43] <Exx2xxO> okay lol I thought that this seems to be too easy :D now it says that docs isn't defined, but I defined it as global var in another js ... oh man javascript drives me crazy :/
[12:05:23] <SCD[Eire]> Kambfhase: shouldnt be a php issue. Will .load() grab php variables embedded within it?
[12:05:27] <SCD[Eire]> Docs aren't very clear
[12:05:27] <Exx2xxO> http://jsbin.com/ufeweb/2/edit
[12:05:56] <Kambfhase> .load() just loads a file. the php is just serverside.
[12:06:10] <shoky> Exx2xxO: i dont see docs being defined anywhere
[12:06:21] <Kambfhase> jQ doesnt differentiate between php and plain html
[12:06:26] <Lyfesaver> http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/threads/actionscript-developer-needed.104883/
[12:06:32] <Lyfesaver> crap
[12:06:35] <Lyfesaver> sry guys wrong window
[12:06:36] <Exx2xxO> shoky: as I said it's in another js declared
[12:06:48] <shoky> Exx2xxO: another js which you neglected to show ;)
[12:07:04] <Exx2xxO> :D I hoped it is not needed :D
[12:07:04] <shoky> Exx2xxO: it's probably not declared in the global scope
[12:07:42] <SCD[Eire]> Kambfhase: in which case I am very confused :P
[12:07:49] <Exx2xxO> shoky: http://jsbin.com/ufeweb/4/edit
[12:08:07] <Exx2xxO> there it is .. and like wards and type it's global
[12:08:35] <shoky> Exx2xxO: ok and we're not getting any error ;>
[12:09:25] <shoky> (if we include jquery of course http://jsbin.com/ufeweb/6/edit )
[12:10:04] <shoky> well the post callback isn't called. but , docs is defined, there's no prob with this js
[12:11:18] <shoky> nvm sorry
[12:11:39] <shoky> thought it was the same js just with the added vars
[12:12:35] <Exx2xxO> nvm?
[12:12:52] <shoky> nevermind ;p
[12:12:57] <Exx2xxO> oh okay :D
[12:13:23] <shoky> are you saying that wards and type are accessible but docs is not?
[12:13:31] <Exx2xxO> yep
[12:13:43] <Exx2xxO> so actually js is saying that :D
[12:14:06] <shoky> which line is giving you 'docs is undefiend'
[12:14:40] <Exx2xxO> line 84
[12:15:06] <shoky> which line is that :\
[12:15:27] <Exx2xxO> where I try to append it to my div > ul part in the html
[12:15:35] <Exx2xxO> $('#docsList .cats').append('<li><a href="#" id="'+docs[key].docid+'">'+docs[key].name+'</a></li>');
[12:15:44] <shoky> huh
[12:15:51] <shoky> but you're referencing docs in the line just before that
[12:16:01] <Exx2xxO> yep
[12:16:14] <shoky> what's the exact error?
[12:16:41] <shoky> wait
[12:16:49] <shoky> if (!docs[key]) {   LETS REFERENCE docs[key] }
[12:16:50] <shoky> ??
[12:16:59] <shoky> how does that make sense
[12:17:12] <Exx2xxO> you mean?
[12:17:14] <shoky> i mean
[12:17:39] <shoky> you are saying:   if docs[key] is not defined -> lets use docs[key]'s value to do stuff
[12:17:49] <shoky> also , what's the exact error?
[12:18:15] <Exx2xxO> eh I tried to do the exact counterpart xD I wanted that it only uses docs[key] if it IS defined
[12:18:39] <shoky> if that '!' is not a typo, you need to learn javascript ;)
[12:18:45] <Exx2xxO> firebug says: "docs[key] is undefined"
[12:18:48] <shoky> exactly
[12:18:51] <shoky> not 'docs'
[12:18:55] <shoky> you are also a liar :D
[12:19:08] <Exx2xxO> I'm a liar xD?
[12:19:09] <shoky> (jk)
[12:19:14] <shoky> you said it tells you docs is not defined
[12:19:22] <Exx2xxO> yeah firebug tells me :D
[12:19:33] <shoky> no, it tells you docs[key] is undefined
[12:19:37] <shoky> do you need glasses too :\
[12:19:46] <Exx2xxO> :/
[12:19:49] <Exx2xxO> sry
[12:20:26] <shoky> anyway, so you're set?
[12:20:38] <Exx2xxO> but how can I tell javascript that it only has to use docs[key] if it is defined ?
[12:20:39] <shoky> i mean did you understand the error
[12:20:47] <shoky> if ( docs[key] ) { ... }
[12:20:49] <shoky> works good usually
[12:20:52] <Exx2xxO> o.o
[12:20:55] <Exx2xxO> so simple xD
[12:20:56] <shoky> why did you put the ! there
[12:20:59] <shoky> ! means NOT
[12:21:17] <Exx2xxO> oh yeah exactly...sometimes I'm so stupid >.<
[12:21:38] <Exx2xxO> I'll go edit this and then I'll go crying :D
[12:21:41] <shoky> i wouldn't say stupid, just a bit careless :P
[12:21:49] <Exx2xxO> :D
[12:22:10] <Exx2xxO> works fine ! thank you very much :D
[12:22:16] <shoky> np
[12:23:57] <Exx2xxO> lol and another funny problem just arrived :D It doesn't list all the items which I got back from the server o.o Oh did I mentioned that I hate javascript xD ?
[12:24:25] <shoky> if you learn it you might like it ;)
[12:25:35] <nFFF> javascript got a lot of nerd hate for no reason imo
[12:25:45] <Exx2xxO> I learned actionscript and it was as painful as javascript (maybe a bit more) I just want to finish this project and then never touch it again :(
[12:26:11] <nFFF> Exx2xxO what other languages you using for this project?
[12:26:37] <Exx2xxO> nothing you could call language :D Just html,css,javascript
[12:26:54] <nFFF> :)
[12:27:30] <Exx2xxO> Oh and then after the websites works fine I have to translate it with "PhoneGab" to an iOS and android app :P
[12:29:59] <venus_> hello, how can i set the height of a div equal to the height of the window
[12:32:05] <jita> How can i access $(this) in ajax success function ?
[12:32:48] <m1d0_> maybe someone can help me out. http://173.255.214.135/tp/deploy/ - those images at the bottom... they have a property of max-width/max-height to fit their parent div. however, i want to center them vertically within their parent div. is there a way to get the *adjusted* height of the image (after the max-width value sizes it to less than the actual image's height)?
[12:32:56] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Announcing the jQuery Mobile Download Builder tool - http://t.co/dO88HoNq ★ http://bit.ly/KTnRMw
[12:33:02] <systemfault> jita: You assign $(this) to another variable in the outer scope.
[12:34:55] <m1d0_> e.g., that image on the bottom left is 169px but after it's been sized to fit the div it's actually 87px high. how do i get that value?
[12:44:49] <shoky> m1d0_: with .height()
[12:48:08] <shoky> venus_: $('div').height( $(window).height() )
[13:01:38] <Exx2xxO> okay so I found out what the problem is but not how to solve it..I wanted to save the name,description, validityTime and the document id but not every document has a desciption. instead of a full description the server returns "" so how can I control if the description is at least "" ?
[13:01:50] <Exx2xxO> I hope I described everything right xD
[13:04:52] <m1d0_> that worked. i'm 2 newb... another common question i have, as a newb... i often want to get a jquery element of something that's a child or parent of another jquery, element... how do i adjust this so that it gives me the 'html()' part as a jquery object. $(item).html()
[13:05:24] <venus_> how can i click on a div and make it scroll to another div
[13:05:26] <m1d0_> what i've been doing because i'm a newb is doing var child = $(item).html();, and then on a new line $(child)
[13:07:05] <jita> can i do onclick="document.forms['id'].submit()" ?
[13:41:12] <Exx2xxO> no idea anyone?
[13:47:52] <Whirl3d-Out> Good afternoon all, is it my imagination or is the bs grid system nothing more than tables turned into spans/divs. Wouldn't it just be easier to compile a "table to fluid bs fluid grid coverter" than to get everyone to sit around with a calculator and calculate a 12 cel wde table on 940 px?
[13:49:42] <Whirl3d> and why are tables so bad? If you have to have js to modify your css and shim your layout, why not do the same for table-based layouts that already support percentages?
[13:51:15] <systemfault> Do you have a real problem mister Whirl3d?
[13:51:28] <darcyclarke> Whirl3d not sure if this is a very #jquery-esque convo. Maybe write a blog post or post an issue on https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/ Might be a more appropriate outlet for these questions
[13:51:36] <systemfault> grid systems suck and aren't necessary
[13:52:34] <ravenzz> ++
[13:52:50] <ravenzz> grid systems are for noobs and lazy people
[13:52:58] <ravenzz> as bootstrap is
[13:53:02] <systemfault> Heh.
[13:53:08] * systemfault agrees.
[13:53:27] <ravenzz> that is the main reason why it is so popular imho
[13:53:36] <systemfault> ravenzz: I used bootstrap once for a CMS section of a website for work
[13:54:11] <systemfault> It makes it really easy to make decent looking websites for people who don't understand HTML/CSS/JS
[13:54:14] <ravenzz> yeah I am the king of lazy people, but at least I am aware of that, and still i don't use it
[13:54:36] <systemfault> :)
[13:55:24] <ravenzz> I'd rather prefer people that use it instead of making their own crap
[14:04:48] <Exx2xxO> Is there any way to check if a var is just an empty string or  a undefined var ?
[14:05:08] <ravenzz> we are still waiting for that
[14:05:32] <Exx2xxO> damn thats what I need
[14:05:41] <ravenzz> life sucks dude
[14:06:33] <ravenzz> btw there were a pioneer guy who said that if (foo === "" || typeof foo === 'undefined')
[14:06:36] <ravenzz> could work
[14:10:16] <oojacoboo> can you chain deferreds with any jq method?
[14:10:25] <oojacoboo> or does it need to be jqXHR
[14:10:55] <systemfault> oojacoboo: It also works with .animate and your own deferreds :P
[14:11:00] <oojacoboo> I'm guessing the object has to be derived from the deferred object
[14:11:09] <oojacoboo> systemfault, ?
[14:11:33] <systemfault> oojacoboo: First of all, what do you mean by chaining for Deferreds?
[14:11:50] <oojacoboo> systemfault, form.find("this").after(var).done(myCallback);
[14:13:13] <systemfault> I don't get that.. sorry
[14:14:29] <systemfault> What's the point of having .done there?
[14:14:49] <systemfault> Deferred make sense for async code..
[14:15:00] <Whirl3d> systemfault, darcyclark, ravenzz, thanks for the replies. I am glad to know that I am not the only one who doesn't like the grid system. The context of which is, of course, bootstrap and it's latest rise in popularity and the increasing number of support questions posted in #jquery as a result..just to be clear.
[14:15:15] <oojacoboo> well, it's injecting objects in the DOM, so I wouldn't want to fire code before that's completed
[14:15:34] <systemfault> oojacoboo: DOM calls are synchronous AFAIK
[14:15:36] <oojacoboo> but I guess I could just call that function after
[14:15:40] <systemfault> Right.
[14:16:12] <systemfault> The power of Deferred is with async code, they're unbelievably sexy for that.
[14:16:18] <oojacoboo> right
[14:16:54] <systemfault> I wish you could "serialize"  Deferred...
[14:17:12] <Whirl3d> you mean as in pipe
[14:17:12] <systemfault> You can somehow do it with .pipe.. but it's fugly
[14:17:19] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:17:47] <Whirl3d> $.Callback() also seriealizes, I believe.
[14:17:49] <systemfault> Whirl3d: I would like something like a $.syncWhen :P
[14:18:01] <systemfault> Ah? Never heard of $.Callback, is that new?
[14:18:06] <Exx2xxO> yeah lol simple is allways the best : if((doc.description) || (doc.description == "")) worked pretty fine xD
[14:19:07] <oojacoboo> Exx2xxO, you also have !doc.description.length > 0
[14:19:12] <Whirl3d> systemfault, I am not sure when they added it, but it's nice....I have been using it more and more lately.
[14:19:56] <Whirl3d> so what about .pipe or .when isn't working the tway you'd like?
[14:20:09] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Unnecessary verbose.
[14:20:29] <Whirl3d> me or .pipe? lol
[14:21:01] <oojacoboo> I need to play around with Deferreds a bit more
[14:21:11] <oojacoboo> the power of them to clean some shit up, is huge
[14:21:21] <systemfault> Whirl3d: .pipe :P
[14:21:26] <Exx2xxO> oojacoboo yeah right forgot about that :D
[14:21:58] <Exx2xxO> but does this also work with "" ?
[14:22:05] <oojacoboo> sure
[14:22:13] <Whirl3d> I just think that one-off callback systems are counter-intuitive. It seems hacky to me to have a one-way state system with at first two states, now 3 soon to be ? just manage the states and be done with it, imo
[14:22:36] <oojacoboo> Whirl3d, absolutely
[14:22:44] <oojacoboo> but that wasn't possible without Deferreds really
[14:23:00] <oojacoboo> so, it's certainly a new thing in the organization of js
[14:23:32] <oojacoboo> and it really just requires some practice before you're able to really harness the power of them
[14:24:45] <Whirl3d> yeah, I thnk we'll see the deprecated in favor of a richer pubsub system that will build deferreds as decorated $.callbacks
[14:25:21] <oojacoboo> deferreds are certainly an introduction into a much more elegant organization of js
[14:25:35] <oojacoboo> and I think we'll see a lot of growth around that in the coming years
[14:25:56] <oojacoboo> overall the way people think and build web applications, the structure of files/code/etc
[14:26:13] <systemfault> promises aren't new...
[14:26:23] <oojacoboo> nope
[14:26:58] <oojacoboo> that's part of the prototype object
[14:27:37] <systemfault> O_o o_O
[14:28:36] <Whirl3d> I gots to run, but I have enjoyed the convo. systemfault, I have a script for you to look at. I used it to make serialized image loading by nesting deferreds. It works really well, but you might find it usefull for your .serial when needs... dunno? I;ll post it when I get back. gday all
[14:29:03] <systemfault> :)
[14:29:13] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Give me a link when you'll be back
[14:51:12] <venus_> how can i scroll by clicking a div to another dic
[14:51:16] <venus_> div*
[14:54:34] <oojacoboo> venus_, on page anchor
[14:54:59] <oojacoboo> $.scrollTo
[15:01:42] <Mac_Weber> there is an element I want to get the click() function, store it, substitute by my own .click() funtion, and later get back to the original function. How to do it?
[15:02:31] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber, trigger?
[15:03:15] <johnkpaul> Mac_Weber: for what purpose?
[15:03:20] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber, or, better yet, use a proper callback
[15:03:30] <Mac_Weber> oojacoboo: no, I want to replace the this element's click function, and later get back to the original
[15:03:43] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber, that's fine
[15:03:50] <oojacoboo> what's the original?
[15:04:27] <Mac_Weber> its a jcarousel next button, I want it to do something different sometimes
[15:04:30] <oojacoboo> mac http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1551389/how-to-enable-default-after-event-preventdefault
[15:04:33] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber,
[15:05:33] <oojacoboo> if I had to guess, I'd say this is a case of "you're doing it all wrong"
[15:05:36] <oojacoboo> but w/e
[15:06:07] <Mac_Weber> oojacoboo: what do you suggest to change the click behavior of this button?
[15:06:26] <oojacoboo> I'd suggest doing just that, and setup cases for what you want to happen each time
[15:07:44] <oojacoboo> $("a#next-button").click(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); if(); else(); });
[15:10:21] <modles> hey guys
[15:10:28] <Exx2xxO> so I'm out for today thanks everyone for the help :) Good night and maybe we see us tomorrow :D
[15:10:45] <oojacoboo> we see us :P
[15:10:55] <modles> quick question… if i start multiple animates, they dont share a common timer do they? they each have their own interval running right?
[15:11:11] <oojacoboo> modles, you can add a function to the animation
[15:11:13] <Mac_Weber> oojacoboo: and how to enable the default again later?
[15:11:29] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber, I don't know what you want to do
[15:11:32] <oojacoboo> I can't answer your question
[15:11:52] <modles> oojacoboo: what do you mean?
[15:12:20] <Mac_Weber> oojacoboo: I mean, to back to the default click event
[15:12:34] <Mac_Weber> as the event.preventDefault(); might stick there
[15:12:46] <oojacoboo> modles, #("element").fadeOut('slow', function() { });
[15:13:08] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber, as I said, you're most likely doing it wrong
[15:13:42] <oojacoboo> Mac_Weber, if you must, setup a specific selector for just that page
[15:13:48] <oojacoboo> or whatever in the world you're doing
[15:14:17] <oojacoboo> id="a#next-button" class="custom-page"
[15:14:30] <oojacoboo> id="next-button" class="custom-page"
[15:14:52] <oojacoboo> $("#next-button.custom-page").click(function(){});
[15:14:59] <Mac_Weber> oojacoboo: thanks for helping anyway, this event.preventDefault() will help
[15:15:26] <ragnok> hi,can you recommend me a jquery book, for javascript developers that knows what functions and closures are?
[15:15:44] <oojacoboo> var closure = function() {}
[15:15:58] <oojacoboo> function() {} //is function
[15:21:32] <databack> .
[15:22:59] <systemfault> ragnok: Just learn how to work with the DOM without jquery… then after, jquery will to extremely easy for you to understand.
[15:23:27] <systemfault> also.. jquery evolves too rapidly, all books are covering old stuff.
[15:24:42] <johnkpaul> ?learn @ ragnok
[15:24:42] <bot-t> ragnok, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:25:02] <johnkpaul> have you read that book already ragnok?
[15:26:04] <systemfault> See what I said…. jqfundamentals doesn't cover .on
[15:26:05] <ragnok> no, but i know vanilla js already
[15:26:09] <subbyyy> i 2nd http://jqfundamentals.com/ great site
[15:26:16] <systemfault> It`s already outdated.
[15:26:50] <oojacoboo> api.jquery.com ftw
[15:27:23] <systemfault> oojacoboo++
[15:27:37] <systemfault> The only good jQuery documentation.
[15:27:40] <garann> ragnok: even if you know JS, jqfundamentals is a great resource for common patterns and best practices in jQuery
[15:28:06] <ragnok> ok, thanks

[15:50:20] <felipe_Brz> how do I check whether a JSON object has a property?
[15:50:42] <felipe_Brz> if i try to access it and it doesn't exists, i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined

[15:51:23] <johnkpaul> wait

[16:10:46] <relipse> how do I get the parent node?
[16:11:03] <relipse> i could do $('blah')[0].parentNode but is there a better way?
[16:11:38] <systemfault> ready: $('blah').eq(0).parent()
[16:11:42] <systemfault> Err relipse
[16:12:08] <systemfault> But using .parent() .next() .prev() should be avoided if possible.
[16:12:22] <systemfault> It creates fragile code.
[16:12:23] <relipse> ummm well I need to access the parent
[16:12:30] <systemfault> Ok :P
[16:12:36] <relipse> so i should put an id on the parent and use that instead?
[16:12:45] <relipse> and what the heck does eq(0) mean?
[16:13:35] <systemfault> relipse: A class that represents what the node is
[16:13:54] <systemfault> Then use .closest(selectorHere) to get to it
[16:15:11] <relipse> what the heck are you telling me, i don't understand
[16:15:43] <rhizmoe> use .closest('...') instead of parentNode
[16:16:08] <oojacoboo> rhizmoe, ^^
[16:16:40] <relipse> why would I put anything in the '...' ?
[16:16:47] <oojacoboo> the element
[16:16:55] <oojacoboo> .closest("div")
[16:17:00] <relipse> oh i see
[16:17:06] <relipse> thanks
[16:17:16] <systemfault> A class would be even better but yeah, that's the idea
[16:17:25] <relipse> well its basically a <label><input></label>
[16:17:34] <relipse> and I need to place the autocompletion inside the label
[16:17:44] <oojacoboo> so yea, .closest("label");
[16:17:50] <systemfault> Like oojacoboo said :)
[16:17:56] <relipse> and that is apparently better than using parentNode
[16:18:00] <oojacoboo> yes
[16:18:11] <relipse> ok
[16:18:12] <relipse> thanks
[16:18:13] <systemfault> relipse: In that "specfic" case, it doesn't really matter
[16:18:22] <systemfault> But in general, yeah
[16:18:26] <relipse> i see
[16:18:28] <relipse> good answer
[16:18:36] <relipse> get a 10/10!
[16:18:40] <relipse> with a smiley!
[16:18:49] <systemfault> Do I get a star sticker?
[16:18:52] <relipse> of course!
[16:18:55] <granden> If I run a .load function and load in a new form to one of my divs. How do I get jquery to listen for the submit button?
[16:18:56] <relipse> gold color!
[16:18:57] <systemfault> Thanks :D
[16:19:16] <systemfault> granden: You use event delegation
[16:19:24] <granden> systemfault: Uhm
[16:19:32] <granden> link or anything?
[16:19:34] <granden> :)
[16:20:11] <systemfault> granden: $(document).on('submit', '#myForm', function() {}); something like that
[16:20:50] <granden> $('#edituser').on('click', function(){});
[16:20:54] <granden> is what I got now
[16:21:29] <systemfault> granden: You never want to listen to the click of a submit button
[16:21:47] <systemfault> What you should do is listen to the "submit" event of the form
[16:21:55] <granden> ok
[16:22:06] <granden> Ok
[16:22:48] <systemfault> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/dquTE/
[16:23:08] <systemfault> 'form' can be the id of a specific form
[16:23:34] <granden> systemfault: Ok cool
[16:23:44] <systemfault> granden: See the way I use .on in that example, it uses event delegation
[16:24:53] <granden> yes
[16:24:55] <granden> but
[16:25:01] <granden> pressing the, HI LOL button
[16:25:11] <granden> seams to refresh the page not catching it really
[16:25:15] <granden> because the button blinks
[16:25:19] <granden> and no alert is displayed
[16:25:26] <oojacoboo> event.preventDefault();
[16:25:55] <granden> oojacoboo: Yeah? systemfault did use it.
[16:26:57] <systemfault> hmm..
[16:27:46] <granden> hmm worked when I runned it on my site.
[16:27:47] <granden> THANKS!
[16:27:54] <systemfault> jsfiddle is super slow..
[16:28:04] <granden> :)
[16:28:12] <systemfault> Perhaps the js wasn't loaded when you clicked on the HI LOL! button
[16:28:27] <systemfault> Anyway :P As long as it worked on your website
[16:28:46] <granden> yeah, thanks!
[16:56:59] <tintin> Hi, is it a correct jquery code? https://gist.github.com/3026089
[16:57:56] <systemfault> Looks good
[16:58:26] <tintin> Or should i be in this way? data: "query="+query,
[16:58:51] <garann> not for a POST, tintin
[16:59:36] <tintin> garann: What do you mean?
[17:00:22] <garann> you don't need to worry about constructing a string unless you're doing a GET
[17:00:36] <garann> tintin: is what you've got not working?
[17:03:09] <systemfault> Has anybody died from the leap second yet?
[17:03:25] <tintin> garann: When do we use like this, data: "query="+query, ?
[17:03:44] <DannysDad> I use jQuery UI to pop up a dialog when I click on a fixed-position tab on my front page.  On click, the div with the content gets CSS-unhidden.  Works great.
[17:03:48] <LuisLeite> can anyone give me help with jqwidgets?
[17:03:49] <DannysDad>  Afaict, all the code/content that's displayed in that unhidden-div is still LOADED onto the page.  I can see it in the ViewSource before unhiding it.  Is there a way to not load all that code UNTIL I click?  not just UNHIDE it on click?
[17:04:26] <oojacoboo> does jquery have something for checking if a strong is json?
[17:04:33] <oojacoboo> typeof of course just returns string
[17:04:43] <systemfault> You try parsing it :P
[17:04:46] <oojacoboo> I need to know if a returned value is json or an error psg
[17:04:54] <oojacoboo> systemfault, can't do that b/c you can't parse non json
[17:04:56] <systemfault> If it fails.. it's not json
[17:05:13] <oojacoboo> systemfault, and the browser doesn't like it
[17:05:23] <systemfault> Why not?
[17:05:35] <oojacoboo> b/c it can't parse it, throws an error
[17:05:48] <oojacoboo> it halts js with console for me
[17:06:18] <systemfault> Then guess what you need to do?
[17:06:39] <oojacoboo> I dunno
[17:07:08] <systemfault> :(
[17:07:13] <systemfault> You catch the exception
[17:07:18] <oojacoboo> bah
[17:07:21] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/TsD8T/
[17:07:23] <garann> tintin: you'd build a string if you were doing a GEt request, instead of a POST
[17:07:40] <oojacoboo> systemfault, I guess that'll do
[17:08:35] <tintin> garann: And for .post and .ajax , alway this way? data: { v: 10 },
[17:09:14] <tintin> No, i see for get this too, $.get("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[17:09:20] <tintin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[17:09:23] <garann> tintin: for $.post, yes - $.ajax can perform any type of request
[17:09:41] <tintin> Is it called jason way? { name: "John", time: "2pm" }
[17:10:01] <garann> tintin: i'm pretty sure $.get stringifys that for you
[17:10:20] <garann> but for a GET, you can also append your stringified data to the url
[17:11:21] <tintin> garann: And what happend for a .post with url?
[17:12:36] <garann> tintin: the URL is just the location on the server you want to hit, and the data becomes the body of your request
[17:14:56] <tintin> garann: Is the data passed with url during .post too like .get ?
[17:15:29] <garann> no, tintin, putting it in the querystring of the url only happens with GET
[17:29:00] <tintin> When we use jquery .ajax, <input type="submit" name="submit" id="id_button_ajax" value="Submit" /> , should it be type="submit" or type="button" , this input in inside a form
[17:29:50] <imsky> wubwubwub
[17:34:21] <systemfault> ?eval (new Array(20)).join('wub');
[17:34:31] <systemfault> :/
[17:34:44] <bot-t> systemfault: No output. (Process Killed)
[17:34:58] <imsky> oh lol
[17:35:10] <raj> in $.ajax(), why does the named function in success option need (data) passed to it?
[17:35:13] <raj> why isn't it automatic
[17:35:26] <shoky> wat
[17:35:27] <shoky> hi
[17:35:28] <imsky> ?js "why is it eval"
[17:35:31] <bot-t> imsky: "why is it eval"
[17:35:32] <raj> hi :)
[17:35:39] <imsky> ?js new Array(20).join("wub")
[17:35:40] <bot-t> imsky: "wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub"
[17:35:47] <imsky> victory
[17:35:48] <systemfault> Ah
[17:36:01] <shoky> raj whatcha mean?
[17:36:16] <systemfault> raj: What do you mean darling^
[17:36:17] <shoky> function(data)  that?
[17:36:17] <systemfault> ?
[17:36:27] <raj> $.ajax({url:'/somewhere', success: someFunc(data)})
[17:36:35] <shoky> er
[17:36:35] <systemfault> raj: That's not valid
[17:36:37] <raj> why does someFunc need (data)
[17:36:38] <shoky> that's not how to use it
[17:36:48] <shoky> success: function(data) { .... }
[17:36:59] <raj> but a named function
[17:37:07] <shoky> you dont need to pass data
[17:37:12] <raj> oh ok
[17:37:21] <shoky> function someFunc(data) { ...}     $.ajax({url, success: someFunc})
[17:37:24] <raj> damnn, I misread, you're right!
[17:37:30] <shoky> :P!:!P:!P:!P:!
[17:37:36] <shoky> wub on you
[17:37:38] <systemfault> raj: Also.. you should use the cool new way with deferred :P
[17:37:47] <raj> systemfault, what's that?
[17:37:59] <shoky> .done
[17:38:16] <systemfault> $.ajax({url: ''}).done(function(data) {})
[17:38:17] <raj> I don't like chaining methods though
[17:38:26] <shoky> raj you don't have to chain
[17:38:27] <raj> is there a way to do so without chaining?
[17:38:31] <shoky> var request = $.ajax(...);
[17:38:36] <shoky> request.done(function......)
[17:38:46] <raj> well, still chaining
[17:38:51] <shoky> nah
[17:38:52] <shoky> ;P
[17:38:59] <shoky> raj it's much more flexible this way
[17:39:00] <raj> i meant if i can put it in the options of $.aja()
[17:39:06] <raj> *$.ajax()
[17:39:13] <shoky> this way you can just for example return $.ajax(...) from some function
[17:39:14] <raj> shoky, why's that?
[17:39:21] <shoky> then later you can call  .done on that returned value
[17:39:21] <systemfault> raj: Using deferred is more powerfulz0r
[17:39:26] <shoky> and pass a new handler
[17:39:33] <shoky> add a new handler
[17:40:22] <shoky> raj putting everything in a big object literal is uglier :\
[17:41:03] <systemfault> raj: You can use promises with $.when.. or use .pipe for added awesomeness
[17:41:47] <raj> i'm not familiar with either of those
[17:42:24] <systemfault> Shame on you!
[17:42:32] <systemfault> Just kidding :P
[17:42:51] <raj> i've dishonored my famury!
[17:42:58] <imsky> FAMORI
[17:43:47] <shoky> raj here's how you can use $.when:   var req1 = $.ajax({url:'url1'}),  req2 = $.ajax({url:'url2'});  $.when( req1, req2 ).done( function(data) { // this is called only when both req1 and req2 are done } );
[17:44:20] <shoky> of course you could also call req1.done( function(data) { // but this will only be executed for req1 } )
[17:44:58] <shoky> raj if you wanna know more about it a very good read is: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[17:45:22] <tintin> When we use jquery .ajax, <input type="submit" name="submit" id="id_button_ajax" value="Submit" /> , should it be type="submit" or type="button" , this input in inside a form
[17:45:33] <tintin> type="button" or type="submit"
[17:45:39] <systemfault> tintin: It should be submit
[17:46:13] <tintin> why submit instead of button?
[17:46:13] <garann> tintin: it's irrelevant - button just takes more effort and won't work without js
[17:46:30] <systemfault> tintin: because type="button" doesn't submit the form
[17:46:35] <garann> *it's irrelevant to $.ajax
[17:47:18] <tintin> Does $.ajax(.. work for both submit and button?
[17:47:28] <systemfault> tintin: It's irrelevant
[17:48:04] <systemfault> tintin: What you need to do is: use type="submit" then you bind to the form's submit event
[17:48:19] <tintin> How? $("#id_form_ajax").click(function() { this?
[17:48:25] <systemfault> tintin: no no no
[17:48:56] <systemfault> tintin: $('#id_form_ajax').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault();  doajaxthingshere });
[17:50:13] <garann> systemfault: tintin you can do either
[17:50:27] <garann> if you're not actually submitting the form, it doesn't matter
[17:50:38] <systemfault> garann: Not really… because something else might trigger the submit event...
[17:51:02] <systemfault> garann: pressing <enter> while one of the inputs have focus for example.
[17:51:06] <garann> yeah, but we weren't talking about submitting, we were talking about clicking buttons
[17:51:12] <tintin> Is it necessary to submit a form? i just need the value of <input type="text" name="query" />
[17:51:21] <garann> it's not, tintin
[17:51:26] <garann> that's what i was getting at
[17:51:37] <tintin> garann: It's not for what?
[17:51:56] <garann> it's not necessary to submit to get the value from the input and send it to the server with $.ajax
[17:52:11] <tintin> systemfault: Can you please paste the link of for bind example? I can't understand what is .on for?
[17:52:28] <shoky> tintin just change .on to .bind
[17:52:29] <tintin> When do i need to submit a form?
[17:52:47] <garann> tintin: you need to submit it if you don't want to use ajax
[17:53:00] <garann> if you want to send a traditional POST request to the server
[17:53:15] <systemfault> tintin: .on is the new way to bind events… .bind is old and will eventually be removed.
[17:53:34] <systemfault> tintin: You need a recent version of jQuery to use it though… 1.7 and later
[17:54:00] <shoky> i imagine just calling .submit(function(e) {...}) will call the right one whatever jq you're using
[17:54:11] <imsky> what are you jabberin about
[17:54:25] <shoky> jeezuzky
[17:54:35] <tintin> garann: I need to use $.ajax and i'm using $.ajax({ type: 'POST',
[17:54:39] <systemfault> Djeezuss
[17:54:58] <imsky> we all need to start a kickstarter campaign for jquery 2.0 shirts
[17:55:09] * systemfault thinks that most american fundies think that jesus spoke english
[17:55:11] <garann> tintin: then you can do whatever you like :)
[17:55:14] <shoky> 2015?
[17:55:28] <tintin> garann: whatever = ?
[17:55:30] <systemfault> imsky: I'd buy one for the lulz
[17:55:43] <imsky> well you'd get one for..kickstarting the thing
[17:55:55] <shoky> i'll kick anything
[17:56:11] <imsky> this channel, so much warmth
[17:56:26] <tintin> Can i use <input type="button" .. or <input type="submit".. for $.ajax({ type: 'POST',
[17:56:32] <imsky> yes
[17:56:39] <shoky> tintin, either
[17:56:58] <shoky> tintin: do you want the only thing to trigger the ajax is if that button is clicked? nothing else?
[17:57:03] <tintin> What is recommended ? button or submit?
[17:57:08] <imsky> yes
[17:57:10] <shoky> yes
[17:57:22] <imsky> shoky, now you see the wisdom of yes
[17:57:29] <shoky> yes
[17:57:31] <imsky> yes
[17:57:34] <systemfault> yes
[17:57:53] <imsky> <3
[17:58:00] <tintin> shoky: trigger click event and do $.ajax({ type: 'POST',
[17:58:11] <shoky> tintin: yes
[17:58:12] <systemfault> yes
[17:58:21] <imsky> y/n?
[17:58:29] <systemfault> imsky: Pfff...
[17:58:37] <systemfault> imsky: Y U NO SAY YES?
[17:58:43] <imsky> gave you choice
[17:58:46] <tintin> So is the type="button" or type="submit" irrelevant?
[17:58:49] <imsky> yes
[17:58:56] <shoky> tintin answer the question
[17:58:59] <systemfault> tintin: I told you…
[17:59:07] <shoky> tintin: do you want the only thing to trigger the ajax is if that button is clicked? nothing else?
[17:59:21] <systemfault> He said he had a form.
[17:59:22] <tintin> shoky: YES
[17:59:26] <shoky> YES
[17:59:28] <imsky> the answer to every question
[17:59:30] <imsky> is yes
[17:59:33] <shoky> tintin: why do you have a form?
[17:59:37] <shoky> tintin: why the <form> ?
[17:59:46] <tintin> <form> is option, that's not necessary
[17:59:49] <tintin> optional
[18:00:03] <shoky> tintin: ok. $('#MYBUTTON').click(function() { MY_AJAX() })
[18:00:08] <tintin> But you need to get the value from <input type="text" name="query"
[18:00:08] <shoky> type=button
[18:00:12] <shoky> makes most sense.
[18:00:15] <systemfault> tintin: Then if you wan to do things properly… you need a form.. a input text… and a submit button
[18:00:50] <tintin> systemfault: Why are you saying that a <form with input text and submit button is proper way?
[18:01:13] <systemfault> Because <input> should be in a form...
[18:01:15] <systemfault> As simple as that.
[18:01:30] <shoky> why should they?
[18:01:37] <shoky> cause the spec says?!?!
[18:02:25] <ProLoser|Work> is this passed by default when doing POST in $.ajax() ?? 	headers : {'Content-Type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'}
[18:02:34] <imsky> yes
[18:02:35] <ProLoser|Work> for some reason my backend guys think i need to add it explicitly
[18:02:55] <shoky> are they no
[18:02:56] <shoky> now
[18:03:56] <systemfault> shoky: I think html allows them anywhere… But I always prefer semantic markup
[18:04:12] <systemfault> And I use progressive enhancement whenever possible..
[18:04:58] <shoky> isn't <input> enough semantic markup if all you want is an.. input ?
[18:05:09] <imsky> no you jerk
[18:05:26] <shoky> u make me cry
[18:05:33] <shoky> jqBully
[18:05:41] <imsky> $.fn.jqBully() to u
[18:06:28] <shoky> ProLoser|Work: it's passed by default yes
[18:07:06] <tintin> Is this correct code? https://gist.github.com/3026345
[18:07:26] <tintin> I used form.on('submit' as systemfault recommended it
[18:07:37] <shoky> tintin it looks ok
[18:07:50] <shoky> oh except you forgot event.preventDefault()
[18:07:53] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/heNKn/2/
[18:07:59] <systemfault> tintin: ^^
[18:08:15] <systemfault> See how I took everything from the form?
[18:08:20] <systemfault> That's flexible...
[18:08:30] <systemfault> No stupid url/method hardcoded in the .js file
[18:08:57] <tintin> But i still can't understand why form submit is recommended instead of button click and get the value from <input type="text" name="query" />
[18:09:09] <shoky> hm
[18:09:42] <systemfault> tintin: Let's say that the guy using your website doesn't have JS enabled… what happens?
[18:10:05] <tintin> systemfault: Suppose javascript is enabled
[18:10:10] <shoky> yes
[18:10:32] <tintin> systemfault: You example code doesn't have any $.ajax({
[18:10:37] <shoky> tintin: pressing enter in the input field won't cause the button to be clicked but it'll cause the form to be submitted
[18:12:06] <systemfault> tintin: you would do something like http://jsfiddle.net/heNKn/3/
[18:12:07] <tintin> shoky: Now i understand. <form with submit input is to work with hitting ENTER as well
[18:12:16] <systemfault> tintin: You got it...
[18:12:37] <systemfault> tintin: That's why I said that garann's way is problematic
[18:13:06] <systemfault> PIZZA TIME!
[18:13:18] <shoky> zomg
[18:13:39] <tintin> But i can't understand, why to use event.preventDefault(); , it's doing nothing
[18:13:51] <shoky> tintin: otherwise the from will be submitted by the browser
[18:13:57] <systemfault> tintin: without it, the form would submit the classic way by the browser
[18:13:59] <shoky> and your ajax won't run probably
[18:14:06] <systemfault> Like shoky said :D
[18:14:42] <shoky> you haz pizzA?
[18:14:49] <shoky> can i haz
[18:15:12] <systemfault> Only if you visit me… I'm lazu
[18:15:14] <systemfault> *lazy
[18:15:43] <systemfault> Also.. the pizza will get cold before you get in Québec
[18:16:48] <shoky> i can reheat
[18:17:20] <tintin> I used event.preventDefault(); but this time i can't get the value of print request.POST from server side language
[18:17:39] <shoky> wat
[18:17:47] <tintin> But if i remove this line, event.preventDefault(); i can see the value of textbox doing print request.POST
[18:18:02] <tintin> print request.POST is the server scripting not jquery
[18:18:08] <shoky> yes
[18:18:10] <shoky> um
[18:18:48] <tintin> url: "/articlesearchajax/", this url calls the server sided scripting method def articlesearchajax(request):
[18:19:44] <shoky> your alert(query) is fine?
[18:20:33] <tintin> But i need to get the value from server scripting too
[18:20:56] <shoky> i understand the problem, that's why i'm asking..
[18:21:24] <shoky> you're not getting any POST params serverside?
[18:21:40] <tintin> I think, yes
[18:22:17] <shoky> pastebin your current code
[18:24:54] <tintin> shoky: javascript code?
[18:25:18] <shoky> for starters
[18:25:28] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3026378
[18:25:34] <shoky> maybe the html of the from too
[18:25:41] <shoky> form*
[18:28:23] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3026405
[18:28:24] <tintin> shoky: ^
[18:30:36] <shoky> tintin: does your serverside expect that hidden form field to be in the sent data?
[18:30:45] <shoky> that 'csrfmiddlewaretoken' crap
[18:31:28] <shoky> (because it's being sent when you do a regular form submit)
[18:32:15] <dalefrancis88> hey guys, hoping someone can help me out. I have cloned the jquery source and am trying to run grunt to see the tests and to build it but i am getting an issue
[18:32:30] <dalefrancis88> CreateProcessW:The system cannot find the file specified
[18:32:54] <dalefrancis88> after running "compare_size:files" compare size task
[18:33:14] <tintin> shoky: hidden tags are not necessary, you can ignore them
[18:33:44] <shoky> tintin: so what do you get when you print the received POST params..
[18:33:58] <tintin> <QueryDict: {}>
[18:34:00] <tintin> empty
[18:34:11] <shoky> what's QueryDict ?
[18:34:27] <shoky> nvm
[18:34:52] <tintin> It's a dictionary like { a: 10 }
[18:34:59] <tintin> or { query: obama }
[18:35:08] <shoky> ya
[18:35:22] <tintin> If i remove the event.preventDefault(); i get this, <QueryDict: {u'query': [u'obama'], u'csrfmiddlewaretoken': [u'S6o4Z67EoDRAxnHW3ywSGTI6FYNByYvG'], u'submit': [u'Submit']}>
[18:36:10] <shoky> and you're certain that that hidden tag is not needed?
[18:36:50] <shoky> won't django ignore the request or something if it doesn't have that field
[18:37:04] <shoky> yes
[18:37:04] <shoky> look
[18:37:10] <shoky> While the above method can be used for AJAX POST requests, it has some inconveniences: you have to remember to pass the CSRF token in as POST data with every POST request
[18:37:19] <shoky> (from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/ )
[18:38:10] <shoky> that page even has a workaround for jquery. though maybe you should just add it to the request manually
[18:38:13] <shoky> seems simpler
[18:39:51] <systemfault> Since he uses a form..
[18:40:02] <systemfault> He could simply use .serialize()
[18:40:11] <systemfault> And not think about it ever again.
[18:40:30] <shoky> very true this is
[18:40:46] <shoky> but since i just finished i'll post- tintin checkout https://gist.github.com/3026415
[18:42:50] <shoky> dalefrancis88: maybe that is a question that is better asked in #jquery-dev
[18:42:56] <dalefrancis88> kk
[18:42:58] <dalefrancis88> thanks
[18:47:01] <tintin> shoky: Yes, now i get this, <QueryDict: {u'query': [u'obama'], u'csrfmiddlewaretoken': [u'S6o4Z67EoDRAxnHW3ywSGTI6FYNByYvG']}>
[18:47:52] <shoky> good, yes?
[18:48:11] <shoky> tintin but you should really just use .serialize() as systemfault suggests
[18:48:27] <tintin> shoky: But $("#id_div_article").html(prm); doesn't work as expected
[18:48:45] <tintin> shoky: What is prm here?
[18:48:50] <tintin> shoky: prm = data ?
[18:49:14] <shoky> tintin 1st of all here's how to use serialize: https://gist.github.com/3026415
[18:49:38] <shoky> and prm is what you called the parameter for the success callback
[18:49:46] <shoky> which is the returned data from the server, yes
[18:50:02] <shoky> do console.log(prm) and you can see what it is
[18:50:33] <tintin> shoky: Where would i type console.log(prm);
[18:50:55] <shoky> tintin: first line in your success handler
[18:51:06] <shoky> function (prm) { console.log(prm) .... }
[18:51:21] <shoky> tintin: and then check your browser's console
[18:51:37] <shoky> (and stop using alerts)
[18:51:54] <tintin> shoky: Where is browser console?
[18:52:08] <shoky> tintin: ctrl-shift-j or f12
[18:52:12] <shoky> tintin: what browser?
[18:52:54] <shoky> always check your browser's console.. it also shows you errors

[18:56:30] <shoky> probably
[18:56:45] <shoky> but.. F12 usually opens up your devtools
[18:57:16] <shoky> is that firefox?
[18:57:36] <shoky> or safari
[18:57:40] <shoky> or whut
[18:59:06] <shoky> if that's firefox, then first install firebug
[19:00:39] <tintin> firefox, and i have installed firebug and i use it F12
[19:02:42] <tintin> shoky: Hi,
[19:03:26] <tintin> shoky: $("#id_div_article").html(prm); this prm displays/renders the whole html code inside that <div id="id_div_article"
[19:04:26] <bencahill> Hey guys, how can I sort a jQuery object without actually moving the elements (so I can pass the modified array on to something else)?
[19:04:58] <DwarfSmasher> have been stuck at this problem (http://pastebin.com/VNFfc4bp) for quite a bit, any idea on how to best aproach this?
[19:08:58] <tintin> shoky: Are you there?
[19:15:58] <Guest20798> hey does any one know a good way to simulate pressing enter with Jquery
[19:22:39] <tintin> Is there any problem writing hardcoded url: ?
[19:22:43] <tintin> instead of url = $this.attr('action'),
[19:23:04] <Sazpaimon> if I want to do something like $("selector").stuff() where the selector can be hundreds of objects, what would be the best way to avoid freezing the browser
[19:23:42] <Sazpaimon> specifically, .click(), which triggers an onclick event for each of the elements in the selector. Should I use something like each?
[19:24:05] <Whirl3d> bencahill, $.map or $.makeArray() to get the items into an array and then sor tthe array.
[19:25:08] <Whirl3d> Sazpaimon, no let jquery handle the distribution or create one handler on a partent element using on (the preferred way)
[19:26:00] <Whirl3d> $("parent").on("click","elementclass", function (e) {do stuff() with $(this) being the clicked item});
[19:26:30] <Whirl3d> tintin, there is not a problem with a hardcoded url unless you coded the url wrong.
[19:26:34] <Sazpaimon> I dont know if the later will work, because the actual operation is resizing hundreds of thumbnails on a page to their full dimensions
[19:27:01] <Sazpaimon> the thumbnails can be expanded individually, or an optional "expand all" button, which does them all at once
[19:27:07] <Whirl3d> Guest20798 are you asking to simulate the enter key click on an input element?
[19:27:38] <Whirl3d> so in the parent element (common to all of them), use .on
[19:27:47] <Whirl3d> then one handler handles them all.
[19:28:01] <Sazpaimon> even if the listener was on a parent element, all of the images would need to be resized at once
[19:28:11] <Sazpaimon> which Ive noticed can cause a browser to lock up
[19:28:26] <Whirl3d> depends on how you do it
[19:29:13] <Whirl3d> if you have all the images already cached at full size, it'll be faster. If you have a second hidden layer with all the fullsize images already loaded, then displaying them is pretty quick if you change the opacity on the parent layer only
[19:29:18] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Ok, but AFAIK I need a
[19:29:42] <Sazpaimon> the whole point of having thumbnails is to *not* load fullsize images
[19:30:02] <Whirl3d> then don't bitch if it is going to take a while to load the full size images. wtf?
[19:30:25] <Sazpaimon> im not talking about bandwidth, Im talking about the browser actually locking up when the operation starts
[19:30:35] <Whirl3d> There's no magic means of loading the fullsize images unless you preload them
[19:31:14] <Whirl3d> if they are all preloaded, then it's almost instant---no browser lag
[19:31:31] <Whirl3d> if not preloaded, then wait until they are preloaded to display them
[19:31:49] <Sazpaimon> are you saying the browser locking up and taking a bunch of CPU is caused by the images themselves not being cached?
[19:32:14] <Sazpaimon> and *not* due to the actual javascript operations being performed?
[19:32:21] <Whirl3d> it takes a while for the browser to process each image. If you are loading tons of images, it's gonna take a while
[19:33:05] <Whirl3d> if the images are visible during the loading process, it's gonna be a problem. However, loading the iimage files and appending them to a hidden div allows the broswer to be done with the loading part, freeing it to render all the images.
[19:33:21] <Sazpaimon> even if I, for example, already have the images in my cache, it still locks up, so I don't think downloading the images has anything to do with it
[19:33:30] <Whirl3d> even if you just had the images on the page, no javascript it would take a while
[19:33:40] <tintin> It seems jquery $.ajax displays the content of html page twice
[19:33:42] <Whirl3d> then there is another issue
[19:33:46] <Whirl3d> how are you showing them?
[19:33:49] <tintin> Why?
[19:33:59] <tintin> https://gist.github.com/3026486
[19:34:09] <tintin> $("#id_div_article").html(prm);
[19:34:12] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Sorry about my previous...yes, I think that'll do it, thanks.
[19:34:19] <tintin> this prm is the html code
[19:34:21] <Whirl3d> np
[19:34:50] <tintin> so it displays the <input type="text" .. again inside <div id="id_div_article" .. , why ? how can i stop it?
[19:35:40] <Sazpaimon> Whirl3d, the actual process of changing the thumbnail to the fullsize image is: check if the URL is the thumbnail URL (supplied to the function itself), if it is, change the attrs of the href, width and height to the fullsize values
[19:36:17] <Whirl3d> if it's not...
[19:36:29] <Sazpaimon> then do the reverse, setting it back to the thumbnail
[19:36:46] <Whirl3d> you need to handle that before you try to show them.
[19:37:12] <Whirl3d> in other words, if you know the fullsize image si the same as the thumbnail, add a class to the image;
[19:37:40] <tintin> I can't understand during .ajax why is it necessary to use this? url: "/articlesearchajax/",
[19:37:54] <Sazpaimon> they arent the same, the thumbnail is a different image
[19:38:08] <Sazpaimon> well, the same image, but processed to be smaller dimensions
[19:38:13] <tintin> The action is already there in form, <form id="id_form_ajax" action="/articlesearchajax/" method="post">
[19:38:28] <Sazpaimon> but basically it's a differnet URI
[19:38:30] <Whirl3d> html doesn't care
[19:38:31] <tintin> So which action would i call?
[19:38:34] <Sazpaimon> *different
[19:38:36] <Whirl3d> then why checke
[19:38:44] <tintin> *would it call?*
[19:38:46] <Whirl3d> if it's a different url than it's a different url
[19:38:55] <Whirl3d> checking seems redundant
[19:39:06] <tintin> Should the form action and .ajax url be same?
[19:39:10] <Sazpaimon> so it knows whether to change to the fullsize image or the thumbnail
[19:39:16] <Whirl3d> if its the same url, different CSS, than clone the image with both states, hide one state and show the other
[19:39:25] <Whirl3d> use a class
[19:39:34] <Whirl3d> all images of class thumbnail are small
[19:39:34] <tintin> Whirl3d: for me?
[19:39:41] <Whirl3d> all images of class big are big
[19:39:57] <Whirl3d> an image that changes from thumbnail to big classes gets enlarged
[19:40:02] <Whirl3d> and the reverse is true
[19:40:17] <Sazpaimon> it still needs to know the URI of the fullsize image to change the href
[19:40:29] <Sazpaimon> sorry, src, not href
[19:40:32] <Whirl3d> if it's the same, then what's the deal?
[19:41:03] <Sazpaimon> it's *not* the same, say the fullsize image is 800x800, the thumbnail has been processed serverside to be, say 200x200
[19:41:09] <Whirl3d> you are gonna have to post your code at jsfiddle.
[19:41:31] <Whirl3d> then regex the source
[19:41:55] <Whirl3d> var largeurl=smallImg.attr('src').replace("200x200","800x800");
[19:42:17] <shoky> hi tintin
[19:42:22] <shoky> and whirly
[19:42:30] <Whirl3d> shoky!
[19:42:39] <shoky> wazup
[19:42:40] <Whirl3d> wasssup? how was your trip up north?
[19:43:28] <shoky> was pretty nice. my friend's cat just had 2 baby cats, when they're done feeding off their mum i'll take one ;D
[19:43:29] <Sazpaimon> I dont see how this would be more efficient
[19:44:35] <Whirl3d> okay. then don't do it my way. Your prerogative. No need to argue.
[19:45:04] <Whirl3d> kittehs? cute
[19:45:25] <joo_p23> in twitter bootstap's jquery extension, the extensions are wrapped in !function ($) {  }(window.jQuery)  i'm wondering what !function is
[19:45:48] <Sazpaimon> yeah sorry for being hostile
[19:46:06] <joo_p23> the exclamation before the function
[19:47:09] <Sazpaimon> Im just thinking that the actual javascript operation of changing the src and dimensions of hundreds of images at the same time will always lock up the browser for a few seconds
[19:47:25] <Sazpaimon> maybe each is my best bet, that way there'd be some cooldown time between each iteration
[19:47:56] <Whirl3d> shoky can explain that best, joo_p23, he explained it the other day and it went wizzing by me...sorry
[19:47:58] <shoky> Sazpaimon jquery will use each internally anyway if you run someth on a selector
[19:48:06] <shoky> such as $(selector).click or whatever
[19:48:21] <shoky> Sazpaimon what exactly are you doing that locks up the browser?
[19:49:01] <Whirl3d> change hundreds of images from 200x200 dims to 800x800 without preloading them.
[19:49:16] <Sazpaimon> and changing the src to a different URI
[19:49:17] <Whirl3d> relying on server-size resize function
[19:49:33] <Sazpaimon> the images arent resized onclick, theyre already stored on the server
[19:50:02] <Whirl3d> change the src uri is not the issue. if the images are preloaded, it won't be a problem. But expecting it to be able to load all those images at once...that's the problem
[19:50:28] <Whirl3d> if they were preloaded, the js wouln't choke
[19:51:44] <shoky> joo_p23:  function($) { }  <--- just a function that accepts a param and calls it $.  but if you want to immediately invoke that function, you can't just add a () add the end, you have to either put parens () around the function like (function($) { })();  or:  !function($) { } ()
[19:52:11] <Whirl3d> but the ! is the question..
[19:52:45] <Whirl3d> oh.....i see the difference now
[19:52:53] <joo_p23> i c...wish it was more documented somewhere
[19:53:14] <joo_p23> thx for the explanation shoky
[19:53:41] <shoky> it's just a hackish way (imo) to turn the anonymous function into a function expression you can immediately invoke
[19:53:43] <Whirl3d> !function ($){}()  without the enclosing () works the same as (funct($){}())
[19:54:29] <shoky> i like the parens more. but some people say that putting the ! there is a way to let other devs know that its an immediately-invoked function, without having to find the end of the function and see if there's a () there
[19:55:02] <Sazpaimon> it also saves a byte
[19:55:04] <shoky> and also
[19:55:07] <shoky> yes that ;)
[19:56:10] <ragnok> i see jquery website broken http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[19:56:19] <ragnok> on google chrome
[19:57:01] <shoky> broken?
[19:57:39] <ragnok> yes, there's something wrong in that page,if  you cannot see it... :P
[19:57:51] <tintin> shoky: Hi
[19:58:02] <tintin> shoky: Did you go for eating?
[19:58:27] <shoky> tintin nope i was doin smth. now i cant recall what it was tho :P
[19:58:46] <tintin> shoky: What is smth?
[19:58:50] <Whirl3d> ragnok, it looks good to me?
[19:59:04] <shoky> ragnok - it looks the same to me as it does in FF or IE, for the most part
[19:59:52] <ragnok> this is what i got with chrome http://awesomescreenshot.com/02b9di6f0
[20:00:00] <shoky> "broken"
[20:00:04] <shoky> alert the media

[20:00:57] <Whirl3d> disable your extensions and try it
[20:01:53] <shoky> doesn't change anything
[20:02:59] <shoky> anyway who says that's broken. the text is clear and the link works
[20:04:05] <ragnok> i had disable my extensions,and i still have it "broken"
[20:04:33] <ragnok> the design is broken
[20:04:49] <ragnok> shoky, have you seen my screenshoot?
[20:06:47] <shoky> yes
[20:07:01] <ragnok> and for you that is fine?
[20:07:06] <shoky> don't you have something better to do?
[20:07:11] <ragnok> no
[20:07:35] <shoky> for me that is fine. i am not paying jquery to have a beautiful site
[20:09:25] <ragnok> for me is very bad. see, that's why the web is shit, cause ppl like you is around everywhere
[20:09:40] <shoky> ...
[20:09:52] <Whirl3d> man I wish you were still an op...lol
[20:10:17] <shoky> he's not too bad ;]
[20:10:20] <Whirl3d> you should really ask for a raise...

[20:37:23] <tintin> shoky: Hi
[20:37:44] <shoky> hy
[20:38:22] <shoky> tintin
[20:38:29] <tintin> shoky: I pmed you.
[20:38:41] <shoky> oh
[20:41:53] <Es0teric> how do i prevent a modal from closing UNLESS the close button is pressed?
[20:42:11] <Es0teric> so if theres a form in the modal, how do i prevent it from closing when the submit button is pressed?
[21:00:56] <Es0teric> holy shit... i cant believe
[21:00:58] <Es0teric> i figured this out
[21:01:06] <Es0teric> GOT DAMN... SCORE ONE FOR ALCOHOL
[21:01:31] <tintin> Hello, why am i getting the original html page with .ajax response
[21:01:55] <tintin> So if i click the form, i see it renders the form under the original form
[21:02:07] <tintin> So twice form with the ajax data
[21:02:17] <tintin> for this, $("#id_div_article").html(prm);
[21:02:29] <tintin> See this, https://gist.github.com/3026486
[21:04:29] <shoky> dude
[21:59:51] <tintin> Is the action and method atribute necessary for <form tag when we use jquery ajax because we set type: 'POST', url: '/method/',
[22:10:00] <kmurph79> this won't cause performance issues, correct? http://pastie.org/4180258
[22:12:01] <shoky> kmurph79: probably not
[22:12:31] <kmurph79> shoky: does that event bubble regardless of whether I have it delegated?
[22:13:12] <shoky> kmurph79: think so
[22:13:29] <kmurph79> shoky: cool, thanks
[22:14:00] <shoky> kmurph79: but having delegated it, there'll be an extra function call and checking to see if the event target matches your selector
[22:14:20] <kmurph79> shoky: right
[22:14:23] <shoky> kmurph79: for every mouseenter/mouseleave on every element
[22:14:45] <shoky> so that's the reason for 'probably not' and not 'absolutely not' :P
[22:15:05] <kmurph79> i could just bind it to every $('.tip')… but that would be in the 100s
[22:15:37] <shoky> yea don't do that. it's best to bind it to some container element, the more specific the better
[22:15:54] <shoky> e.g. if all your .tips are in some <div id="container">
[22:15:58] <kmurph79> the whole page is liable
[22:16:06] <shoky> yah k
[22:16:09] <kmurph79> well, except the navbar i guess
[22:16:28] <kmurph79> shoky: thanks again
[22:16:30] <shoky> should be fine, start worrying about it only if you actually see a performance issue
[22:16:33] <shoky> np
[22:16:35] <kmurph79> k
[22:47:53] <Murg|e> I'm trying to do an if for a submit based on if the parents class contains specific text.
[22:48:21] <Murg|e> Would something like this be remotely close? if ($(this).parents().attr("class").find() ???){
[22:48:37] <Murg|e> I know it doesn't work but not sure if im even close.
[23:01:51] <echosystm> is anyone here familiar with qunit?
[23:02:23] <echosystm> im wondering if there is any way to have something automatically added to the setup and teardown of every module
[23:23:10] <abhinav_singh> how do I find value of  selected item inside div   http://paste.ubuntu.com/1068919/
