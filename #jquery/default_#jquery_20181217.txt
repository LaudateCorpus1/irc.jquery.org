[03:12:00] <jkabitshwa> Hello Guys
[03:12:29] <jkabitshwa> i have wrote this script :<script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){$('#anspeculation').change(function(){var anhspec= document.getElementById('anhspeculation');var anspec= document.getElementById('anspeculation').value; anhspec.innerHTML=anspec.toUpperCase();})});</script>
[03:12:34] <jkabitshwa> in wordpress
[03:12:41] <jkabitshwa> it does not work
[03:17:09] <jkabitshwa> i have found the solution
[03:17:23] <jkabitshwa> wordpress does not accept the dollars sign
[03:17:47] <jkabitshwa> i replaced it by jQuery and it solved the problem
[03:24:36] <Cork> jkabitshwa: did you plan to put a question in there somewhere?
[03:25:02] <Cork> or did you just want to share the fact that wordpress run with noConflict by default?
[03:26:43] <jkabitshwa> it was a question but i have found the answer by changing the dollars sign to jQuery
[05:44:53] <anew2> i'm trying to remove t his html attribute on page load but not working .... seems like beginner stuff https://jsbin.com/gegidonobo/edit?html,js,output
[05:49:26] <Cork> anew2: remove_attr, not remove-attr
[05:49:58] <Cork> uh...
[05:50:06] <Cork> no sorry it is removeAttr ...
[05:50:41] <anew2> cork ty.... i think you m ust have been in this channel 10 years now :D
[05:51:02] <Cork> close
[05:52:10] <anew2> damn no still there
[05:54:21] <anew2> hat do you think
[06:02:42] <anew2> anyone
[06:56:16] <Cork> anew2: https://jsfiddle.net/g2yawnck/1/
[06:57:58] <anew2> hmm ok ty cork
[07:03:43] <anew2> cork could jq be inserting it again after i am removing it?
[07:03:50] <anew2> if i put this in the footer will that work ?
[07:06:54] <anew2> cork actually it's removed in the console, but when viewing page source it's still there.... so when i'm trying to form valid xml it is giving an error
[07:07:05] <anew2> so jq works, but it's' still showing in the xml
[07:12:23] <Cork> anew2: jquery can't modify the original html
[07:12:28] <Cork> jquery only touches the dom
[07:16:32] <anew2> ok
[08:41:12] <petzup> https://mojeure.si/test.php
[08:41:49] <petzup> has anybody idea how would i do it, that after hovering for example red color and than go with mouse inside on white bg that will still stay on red hover?
[08:43:12] <Cork> you mean the read should move or what?
[08:43:36] <petzup> go on red border that hover on white inside circle
[08:44:00] <petzup> selected border has been lost, but i still want to have hovered like i'm on red border
[08:45:44] <Cork> well don't use hover but mouseenter, and just not do any mouseleave
[08:46:21] <petzup> but if i leave element on outside than i want to replace text with otherone
[08:46:47] <Cork> so have a mouseleave for the entire cicle
[08:47:11] <petzup> hm yea
[08:47:11] <petzup> ok
