[00:00:21] <JohnDoeSmith> No, it doesn't I suspect compression problem.
[00:04:13] <JohnDoeSmith> And it was. Than You very much for Your help.
[00:04:21] <Cork> np
[00:33:06] <shree> jphase: yeah
[00:33:11] <shree> thanks a lot :)
[00:33:22] <jphase> np
[00:33:41] <shree> actually i am using angularjs
[00:33:55] <shree> and text area to capture text
[00:43:19] <jphase> yeah, you'll probably have to repurpose that to fit your needs - only turned it into a contenteditable div so I could wrap the matched regex in a span
[01:48:34] <socialblogsite> Anyone willing to check my website and find out why two css drop downs stick expanded or not! when touched in iPhone? (something with the events I don’t understand and you probably do)
[02:02:06] <Arko-> How do I get the class of selected option in a <select> ?
[02:17:33] <socialblogsite> Arko-: you could research (google) hasClass() to check for a specific class in your select (whatever you named it)
[02:20:22] <socialblogsite> Arko: if you know how to search in a string or explode a stiring into an array, you can get all the classes with $(‘select#yourid’).attr("class");
[02:21:19] <Arko-> socialblogsite, I needed this: $(this, "option:selected")
[02:21:21] <Arko-> Thanks though
[02:22:15] <Arko-> I am hiding items from a selectbox, but a hidden item remains selected. How can I make sure it auto-selects the first visible option?
[02:24:19] <roxlu> hi! I'm using $(el).css('margin-left'), to get the left margin position of an element that has: margin:0 auto, which works great in all browsers except FF. FF returns 0, is there a more common/better way to get the left position of an element?
[02:24:41] <Arko-> You could try offset()
[02:25:03] <roxlu> offset() and position() return different values the css('margi-left'), at least in Chrome
[02:25:23] <Arko-> And you could calculate yourself, ($(window).width() - $(el).width()) / 2
[02:26:32] <Arko-> Also check the difference between $(window) and $(document)/$('body'), I think $(window) will append a sidebar to the value
[02:26:36] <Arko-> But I'm not too sure about that
[02:26:48] <Arko-> sidebar I mean scrollbar
[02:27:05] <roxlu> Arko-: I want to change the margin-left with JS so calculating like that wouldn't that .. though I guess with a bit more code that should work. But there must be a way to get the top left position of an element
[02:27:57] <Arko-> Do you need the pixels between document and element?
[02:28:05] <Arko-> Or is there a parent div u need the distance between?
[02:29:13] <roxlu> I'm tweening the left of an element and I want to align another element which is positioned with 'fixed' with it
[02:29:32] <roxlu> I guess it's related to this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11110
[02:29:48] <Arko-> Any chance you can set up a fiddle?
[02:30:39] <roxlu> I do that, but I'll experiment a bit first
[02:30:50] <Arko-> Sure, goodluck
[02:30:55] <roxlu> Thanks
[02:34:51] <socialblogsite> roxlu: if you make the parent position relative, yourTwinningElem.position() will return the left and top without having to calculate offsets
[02:39:17] <roxlu> socialblogsite: oh nice that seems to work ... but FF crashed :$
[02:39:52] <socialblogsite> WTFF :P
[02:42:39] <roxlu> lol so your solution seems to fix the FF issue : ) but that doesn't work in Chrome :)
[02:45:59] <roxlu> ok, el.offset().left seems to work in FF/Ch
[02:48:41] <roxlu> (also in IE win)
[02:53:30] <socialblogsite> roxlu: it MUST work in Chrome. it’s the first one to work fine
[02:54:37] <socialblogsite> roxlu: are you sure you are testing position() AFTER the elements are placed by css?
[02:54:45] <roxlu> yes
[02:54:46] <HelperW> How hard is it to impelemtn a twitter feed without having any PHP support etc?
[02:54:54] <HelperW> Into a HTML page.
[02:54:55] <roxlu> position() returns 0 for left, offset() returns the correct value
[02:55:44] <socialblogsite> roxlu: jsfiddle? link?
[02:56:21] <roxlu> it works now
[03:10:28] <umax> i trying to use filereader guys,  i found a tutorial here http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/reading-files-using-the-html5-filereader-api   i ask myself what's the jquery equivalent of "window.onload = function()"  i want to written in jquery. not pure js.
[03:12:27] <umax> hmmm
[03:21:17] <umax> why my change event won't fire ... http://jsfiddle.net/G7b6z/
[03:23:07] <umax> :(
[03:25:25] <umax> hulp me :D
[03:26:07] <Pata> your $(window).load isn't working
[03:26:20] <Cork> umax: http://jsfiddle.net/G7b6z/1/
[03:26:35] <Cork> umax: you bound a onload event inside an onload event
[03:26:43] <Cork> == guarantee to miss the onload event
[03:28:38] <umax> Cork ok now i don't understand nothing http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/reading-files-using-the-html5-filereader-api  go in the middle approx they bound too onload to change event ...
[03:28:41] <dashavoo> Could people with a few minutes to spare give me a bit of constructive feedback/tips on how to make this code more efficient/concise? http://jsfiddle.net/eBh5L/1/
[03:29:13] <dashavoo> I don't usually use javascript, but I am trying to learn. It is a modal dialogue getting content via ajax
[03:29:54] <Cork> umax: if you check in jsfiddle you have "onload" as a dropdown on the left
[03:30:07] <Cork> umax: if you change your original to use "no wrap" your code will work
[03:30:28] <Cork> umax: jsfiddle wrapps your code for you by default so you get it done twice, and that breaks
[03:32:45] <monica891> I have a jQuery content slider... Normally, it slides 11 'divs' with different classes... then I also have a link (<a> tag) which is combined with a javascript filter to hide 4 divs of a specific class... but when the slider passed the 7 (visible) slides it is still sliding 4 empty (white) divs. How to solve this issue? It is difficult to show you the code because it contains PHP and external pictures.
[03:35:04] <umax> Cork ok i go without the load than ..
[03:35:27] <umax> Cork but btw, jsfiddle didn't changed anything what you write in you got.
[03:36:06] <Cork> umax: http://jsfiddle.net/G7b6z/5/
[03:36:19] <Cork> that one is your code and just a change in jsfiddle settings
[03:36:28] <Cork> umax: btw don't use alert for debugging
[03:37:28] <umax> Cork lol it's the same and it works now ? what the fu ck .. :D
[03:38:01] <Cork> umax: check the second dropdown on the left
[03:38:27] <umax> Cork aha no-wrap
[03:38:58] <Cork> umax: a case of where jsfiddle tries to be a bit too helpful :)
[03:39:42] <umax> Cork ye ... damn ok , well in my code it do not work but i think it's because i load the form from a ajax call.
[03:39:58] <Cork> umax: yes that would do that
[03:40:09] <Cork> umax: the fields need to exist before you can bind handlers on them
[03:40:20] <Cork> umax: you might be able to use delegate
[03:40:27] <Cork> but i'm not sure it works for file elements
[03:40:33] <Cork> (you would have to test that)
[03:43:35] <umax> Cork i should use delegate on the ajax fire event ? or on this we wrote now ...
[03:44:06] <Cork> umax: if you bind a delegated event listener on a static parent
[03:44:24] <Cork> umax: it will work for elements added to that parent even if they didn't exist when you added the listener
[03:44:45] <Cork> $('.static-parent').on('change', 'input[type="file"]', function() {})
[03:47:20] <umax> Cork something like this http://jsfiddle.net/EVt8n/1/ ?  but it again not work ... i load the form by ajax but now i wrote it in there fixed.
[03:47:47] <Cork> umax: is #js-fast-ad loaded through ajax?
[03:47:54] <Cork> uh.. and no
[03:47:56] <Cork> not load
[03:48:20] <umax> Cork no the other #js-fast-ad-box is loaded by ajax
[03:48:30] <umax> Cork so the parent #js-fast-ad stays.
[03:48:54] <Cork> you mean the content of js-fast-ad-box?
[03:49:08] <Cork> or are you doing a .append?
[03:49:12] <umax> the full #js-fast-ad-box is replaced with new content.
[03:49:17] <Cork> ah
[03:49:29] <umax> Cork i do something like $("#js-fast-ad-box").replaceWith(data);
[03:49:58] <Cork> umax: http://jsfiddle.net/EVt8n/2/
[03:51:30] <Cork> but ya, doesn't look like change from file bubbles
[03:51:48] <umax> Cork works ... cool hmmm lol so i don't need the load event ? in the tuorial they said the load make sure all images are loaded so you can use it's height or etc.
[03:52:09] <umax> Cork or change event has itself a build load event that makes jquery ... ?
[03:52:15] <Cork> umax: you should wait for ready
[03:52:24] <Cork> so that #js-fast-ad has been parsed
[03:52:35] <Cork> but if you load your script at the end of body, you will get that
[03:52:47] <Cork> there isn't a reason to wait for onload
[03:53:25] <umax> Cork ye i have document ready but i read that if you use ready it loads just the DOM and you can start using jquery but when you using onload it loads the images, applets so you can use the img height .. for example
[03:53:39] <umax> Cork http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10778070/window-onload-vs-document-ready-jquery
[03:53:43] <umax> first answer.
[03:53:49] <Cork> umax: yes that is true
[03:53:52] <Cork> so?
[03:54:01] <umax> Cork i wondering if i can go without it ... D:
[03:54:05] <umax> but it works by far :D
[03:54:15] <Cork> umax: you're working with form elements :)
[03:54:16] <Cork> not images
[03:55:01] <umax> Cork ok well i continue with the tutorial, by the way did you used file reader ? or you are also new to it like me
[03:55:40] <Cork> umax: i've been coding js for close to 20 years ^^'
[03:56:00] <Cork> i think ~18+
[03:56:10] <umax> Cork you got my respect.
[03:58:01] <umax> Cork i'm a php dev, but have to go inside jquery since you want that nice smooth events floating on your websites :D
[03:59:01] <umax> Cork you tryed to use node.js ? to build a complete website in js ?
[03:59:13] <Cork> umax: not my thing
[03:59:24] <Cork> i want to use tools meant for the job
[03:59:34] <Cork> and i don't want js running server side
[03:59:51] <umax> Cork ok
[04:07:09] <jpokorny> jphase: :)
[04:07:57] <seutje> but cork, it's so hip!
[04:10:23] <Cork> seutje: i'm not hip, so ya
[04:11:24] <seutje> <3 :P
[04:18:21] <umax> new Image(); is too from html 5 api ?
[04:20:54] <Cork> umax: it is part of html yes
[04:21:06] <Cork> umax: html5 is markeing and doesn't mean anything
[04:21:29] <Cork> umax: and much of modern html is just written down defacto standards from what browsers implemented
[04:22:25] <decx> it's the 5th major version of the spec, there is a lot of marketing but html5 is a real term
[04:22:26] <Cork> umax: to answer the base question, new Image has worked since ie4 possibly even longer
[04:22:38] <Cork> so it is very old
[04:22:56] <Cork> decx: no html5 was the spec until the spec removed numbering
[04:23:16] <Cork> decx: now days html5 is buzz and includes basically everything you can do in a browser or things used by a browser
[04:23:34] <decx> that's just semantics ^^
[04:23:37] <Cork> canvas, javascript, css, webgl, hardware acceleration and so on
[04:23:46] <Cork> animations
[04:23:56] <Cork> and the tacked on a little bit of html spec
[04:24:03] <Cork> decx: the real spec is just called "html"
[04:24:29] <decx> yeah and that spec has revisions
[04:24:30] <Cork> decx: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/
[04:24:33] <bberry> why is disabling text selection bad?
[04:24:39] <Cork> decx: not really
[04:24:42] <Jattenalle> i remember the good 'ol days when Web 2.0 came out, it was such an improvement over Web 1.0.. wait.. what? ;)
[04:24:51] <Cork> Jattenalle: ya
[04:24:53] <Jattenalle> bberry, because it annoys people
[04:25:15] <bberry> i suppose so. i feel like in the case of sortables it has its purpose though
[04:25:17] <Cork> bberry: cause it makes copying things selecting things not work
[04:25:31] <Jattenalle> bberry, well if it's just the text of a button or title.. meh, it's fine
[04:25:37] <Jattenalle> as long as you don't disable it on actual content text
[04:25:38] <bberry> yeah agreed
[04:25:48] <Cork> bberry: for things you drag you might want to temporarly disable selection to make it work better
[04:25:56] <bberry> true
[04:26:11] <bberry> i was reading somewhere that thta is what jquery ui does
[04:26:23] <Cork> decx: and more specifically http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#is-this-html5?
[04:26:23] <umax> i creating a new var img = new Image();  than i do fileDisplayArea.appendChild(img);   fileDisplayArea is a <div> however the image appear as a <img how i can change the height and width of the new image ?
[04:26:26] <bberry> (btw, thoughts on jquery ui?)
[04:26:44] <rindolf> umax: what is Image()?
[04:26:56] <Jattenalle> bberry, it does, when you use draggable it disables selection
[04:27:03] <Cork> rindolf: its basically the same as document.createElement('img')
[04:27:10] <rindolf> Cork: ah.
[04:27:13] <bberry> Jattenalle yep XD
[04:27:14] <umax> rindolf var img = new Image(); and img.src = reader.result;
[04:27:25] <Jattenalle> bberry, only when you actually drag though :)
[04:27:28] <umax> rindolf reader is new filereader.
[04:28:00] <umax> rindolf i basically getting the localurl of filereader ... than i set the img.src
[04:28:02] <bberry> yeah. i read that theres some css to do the same thing now. not sure which way theyre disabling it. though i suppose it doesnt much matter haha
[04:28:12] <rindolf> umax: ah.
[04:30:46] <umax> well when i use img.width = "50"; it works it changes the width to 50px but how i can get the original width of the image i load with filereader ? i have a function to calculate aspect ratio to keep a normal size of the image.
[04:31:17] <umax> so i need the original width and height of the image.
[04:34:13] <seutje> umax: don't u need to wait for load to fire?
[04:35:14] <umax> seutje i using on change ... http://pastebin.com/EuDKG2qz this is what i got
[04:35:29] <umax> seutje the image is loading but i don't know how i can get it's dimensions.
[04:35:55] <seutje> if it's loading, it has no dimensions yet
[04:36:00] <umax> seutje i found out also how i can resize the image with img.width = "50"; but i don't know how to get the dimensions of the image. so i can calc aspect ratio
[04:36:19] <seutje> lol, I read that the first time :P
[04:36:27] <seutje> that's cause that value sticks
[04:36:33] <seutje> so it gets applied once it's loaded
[04:36:33] <paulvd> hello, am trying to get this to work for each "h3", but the wrap all is wrapping around the entire set http://jsfiddle.net/Za4HF/
[04:36:58] <umax> seutje hm what line sry i don't get it ...
[04:37:40] <seutje> the one 6 minutes ago
[04:38:02] <seutje> umax: I dunno how filereader works, but I don't think it knows about images http://pastebin.com/m6E7JJHL
[04:39:48] <umax> seutje oh nice so i can wrap that over src.img also right ? it works :)
[04:39:55] <umax> img.src i mean :D
[04:40:33] <seutje> umax: gotta set load before setting src though, otherwise it never fires, and then it's still somewhat problematic with cached images
[04:43:53] <umax> when i have in a function something like this : return { width: srcWidth*ratio, height: srcHeight*ratio };   how i can catch that from the function ? i know it's maybe a noob question but i never did this before.
[04:44:32] <umax> like var myfunc = functionhere();  and than myfunc.height and myfunc.width ?
[04:44:37] <Cork> ya
[04:44:39] <umax> k
[04:45:03] <Cork> or just functionhere().width if you only want one of them
[04:52:10] <paulvd> hello, am trying to get this to work for each "h3", but the wrap all is wrapping around the entire set http://jsfiddle.net/Za4HF/
[04:53:36] <decx> wrap first http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Za4HF/1/
[04:54:15] <decx> don't even need each http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Za4HF/2/
[04:54:42] <umax> why it says me that "ReferenceError: arHeight is not defined  	  img.height = arHeight;"  http://pastebin.com/a3pnThzj
[05:01:00] <umax> how to convert a number to string ?
[05:02:58] <maZtah> anyone using https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask knows how to create a mask with a range from 1-80?
[05:13:35] <umax> well by far not bad :D http://jsfiddle.net/zv6f2/2/
[05:13:56] <umax> put image there, the problem is it first show you the original size for a milisecond and than it resize ..
[05:20:44] <tushigushi> Hello, I need a hint about select list. How can I make function execute as I choose value from the list? In other words how can I avoid using a button?
[05:22:12] <rindolf> tushigushi: there's a handler for that.
[05:22:44] <tushigushi> When I use .click with select list it execute function before i get the value chosen
[05:22:56] <rindolf> tushigushi: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[05:24:06] <tushigushi> Great! thanks rindolf.
[05:24:15] <rindolf> tushigushi: you're welcome.
[05:32:48] <umax> when i want to upload my loaded files by "FileReader" i need to use new FormData() ?
[05:33:12] <Cork> umax: yes, and you need to tell ajax to not encode the data
[05:33:46] <umax> Cork ok i following this one, http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/uploading-files-with-ajax--net-21077 ty by now.
[05:35:49] <umax> Cork well where i can find more about new FormData() ? i mean new users can't know what functions and possiblities this class has ... where is a good clean reference ...
[05:35:52] <Cork> umax: ya, the page claims a bit more then it can keep, but ya
[05:36:04] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[05:36:05] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[06:12:08] <daniel891> Hi. I need help with my jquery slider. Please, be so kind and check http://jsfiddle.net/daniel891/5cKM7/     How can I avoid the doubled "blue slide" after I hid the red one?
[06:16:15] <daniel891> Anyone?
[06:17:16] <Cork> daniel891: slideshow not slider
[06:17:28] <daniel891> *slideshow, sorry
[06:18:06] <Cork> but i don't see any double
[06:18:35] <slax0r> can JS or jQ read http header refresh?
[06:18:37] <daniel891> When you click on the link "Hide Red", then you see "blue twice" (like it was replacing the Red one)
[06:19:15] <Cork> slax0r: no
[06:20:40] <slax0r> this sux :/
[06:20:54] <daniel891> Cork, do you understand what I mean?
[06:23:02] <Cork> daniel891: well you would have to do nextAllUntil(":visible") so you can move all the hidden ones
[06:23:22] <Cork> daniel891: as if you move a hidden element it won't change the position in the show
[06:26:06] <QQ_Bee> he is using "display: none;" for the red slide.
[06:26:20] <Cork> QQ_Bee: yes and that is why i used :visible
[06:30:03] <daniel891> the red slide (class c)  is getting hidden with this function  "$(".c").fadeOut();"  which will be executed when clicking on the link with the id "singles only"...
[06:30:21] <daniel891> How I should integrate nextAllUntil(":visible") ?
[06:30:39] <Cork> ?nextUntill
[06:30:52] <Cork> stupid bot...
[06:31:10] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[06:31:18] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/
[06:31:38] <Cork> daniel891: you need to call it the cases you use :first-child/:last-child
[06:31:52] <Cork> to grab those hidden and not just the next one even if it is hidden
[06:35:05] <daniel891> I understand... it is just not easy to figure out where exactly in the code I should put that nextAllUntil(":visible")
[06:35:10] <daniel891> I have done this here now: http://jsfiddle.net/daniel891/5cKM7/1/
[06:35:17] <daniel891> but is lagging crazily now
[06:41:12] <daniel891> What is wrong?
[06:46:20] <milligan> Does .tooltip from jqueryUI not work on <area elements?
[06:51:02] <daniel891> Can anyone help me, please?
[06:59:55] <QQ_Bee> i think the problem should be in this one "var slideCount = $('#slider ul li').length;" - when you fadeout() the red slide, slideCount length remains four, but in fact you want it to be three.
[07:00:00] <BillCriswell> milligan: I don't see how it would? Never thought about that.
[07:00:55] <daniel891> QQ_Bee, and how it should define the fact that slidecount should ignore the red one then?
[07:02:39] <QQ_Bee> you may use a .hide class to tag this hidden li and then get numbers of the left (which are not tagged)
[07:07:52] <skullcrasher> is it normal behaviour that jquery append overwrites an object, if appended twice (to same container)?
[07:08:07] <QQ_Bee> err.. frankly speaking, i'm also a noob, still needs time to figure out the solution.
[07:09:09] <daniel891> I can't figure it out :(
[07:12:52] <daniel891> skullcrasher, do you the solution for my problem? http://jsfiddle.net/daniel891/5cKM7/1/
[07:14:12] <Arko-> How can I use a variable I set in a change() function, inside another change() function?
[07:14:15] <Arko-> Like, global it
[07:16:58] <Arko-> Got it, just remove var when u declare it
[07:18:06] <Pata> Arko- you should still delcare the variable somewher else, preferably within another scope that's not global
[07:18:11] <Pata> or you could use .data() to store it in the element
[07:18:34] <Arko-> I am declaring it in my doc ready
[07:18:38] <Arko-> With a default value
[07:18:41] <maZtah> anyone using https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask knows how to create a mask with a range from 1-80?
[07:20:33] <nervousMoose> maZtah, it says it supports regex mask support, I imagine there's a regex combination somewhere out there for a range of numbers
[07:21:36] <maZtah> but with the regex you lose the mask, afaik
[07:21:52] <maZtah> and i think it's quite a hard regex ;o
[07:23:28] <cnap> hey guys, I have a loader based on css which is outside the main container. So the main container is firstly hidden and when the loading effect is done, I fadeIn the main container.
[07:24:17] <cnap> so can I avoid somehow things moving up and down ?
[07:24:30] <cnap> after this all happens? I am struggling to do it, but Im noob with css
[07:25:37] <meng_1h> ?
[07:26:12] <nervousMoose> cnap: Your loader icon/gif/whatever is probably pushing the main container down, and once the loader is hidden, the container moves up?
[07:26:59] <cnap> nervousMoose: I had this issue before but using position and z-index I managed to make it go
[07:27:13] <cnap> however now the load bar is moving a bit downwards
[07:27:18] <cnap> while loading
[07:27:36] <cnap> I know you cant be much of an assist if you cant look at the code
[07:27:43] <nervousMoose> Makes it harder :P
[07:28:04] <cnap> ok I could upload it in my host if you have time to check
[07:28:05] <kraftman> if i pass a global into a function does it become local, and if so how do i edit the global?
[07:28:33] <nervousMoose> I would say to play around with converting the loader into an inline element, then try positioning with absolute? That's where I would start
[07:30:03] <User322> stu "d!ckless" lantz betrays all; trannys & queers(chaste Homos/a$$holes), rule; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_by_country
[07:30:06] <User322> gone
[07:30:16] <nervousMoose> wat
[07:30:24] <kraftman> watt
[07:31:00] <cnap> nervousMoose: heres if your interested http://ceid-web-project.com/index.php
[07:31:35] <cnap> nervousMoose: i didnt try making it inline element neither do I understand why :D
[07:34:53] <anli__> Should not app.navigate("#:back"); decrease kendo.history.locations.length?
[07:35:47] <anli__> Oh, it maybe does
[07:35:52] <anli__> But no immediately
[07:35:59] <nervousMoose> cnap: Can't play with it much because I'm at work, and FireBug is not cooperating with it, but I would play around with different display types. I think doing display: inline; should make it easier to move around. Sorry I can't be of more help immediately; cool site by the way
[07:36:30] <cnap> nervousMoose: thank you for your effort. Glad that you like it. I consider it crap atm
[07:36:41] <cnap> it is for a Uni assignment and we doing it from scratch
[07:36:53] <cnap> so I have lots to learn yet. I will try playing with inline
[07:43:26] <meng_1h> \msg
[07:51:09] <DeltaHeavy> Should I really be prefixing my variables that will only hold jQuery objects with '$'? I know it's kind of subjective but is it a "best practise"?
[07:52:08] <HelperW> I see in my console everytime a
[07:52:17] <HelperW> : @end  expected error.
[07:52:23] <HelperW> I have really no clue where it comes from.
[07:52:37] <HelperW> And how to solve it. But because of that I think my slider is not working anymorein internet explorer 9
[07:54:19] <brunoais> DeltaHeavy, nope. It's just a habit some people have
[07:54:59] <brunoais> I'm one of those. I continuesly lose track when it is a NodeList (or an HTMLCollection), a Node or a jQuery object
[07:56:11] <brunoais> In my case, for NodeList or HTMLCollection, I end the variable name with an "s" (to give it a plural sense), when it is a jQuery object, I start with a "$"
[07:56:24] <softplay> hello
[07:56:26] <brunoais> HelperW, no line code?
[07:57:03] <moldy> hi
[07:57:08] <HelperW> I don't know where to start brunoais
[07:57:11] <softplay> i've an ajax call which retrieves the response (according to firebug) but doesn't catch it is the success function
[07:57:13] <HelperW> Wich line to send you.
[07:57:33] <HelperW> File: testpage, Line: 1043, Column: 5
[07:57:34] <brunoais> softplay, what was the response status code?
[07:57:40] <HelperW> SCRIPT1029: '@end' expected
[07:57:55] <HelperW> Wich is: });	</script>
[07:58:12] <softplay> brunoais 200 OK
[07:58:21] <softplay> http://bpaste.net/show/HulKGSAPO2RcTFbFO3QU/
[07:58:28] <softplay> this is the code
[07:58:42] <brunoais> HelperW, sounds like a "}" or a ")" missing somewhere
[07:58:52] <softplay> i didn't use jsfiddle cause it is an ajax call so it doesn't work on an other domain
[07:58:55] <brunoais> HelperW, try adding some randomly or re-indenting the code
[07:59:30] <systemfault> softplay: Add an error handler… look at the error. Also, the network tab of your dev tools might help.
[07:59:31] <brunoais> softplay, add a fail callback
[07:59:50] <brunoais> then tell use what appears there
[07:59:54] <brunoais> *us
[07:59:59] <softplay> ok
[08:03:02] <DeltaHeavy> If I want to store an array of jQuery objects, is it a bad idea to use an $.each loop and just push them into an array wrapped around $()?
[08:04:32] <DeltaHeavy> I have an example here - https://www.refheap.com/85423
[08:07:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Any reason why you'd want to do the second way over the first?
[08:07:39] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Because I'll only be referencing them as jQuery objects. It seems redundant to wrap it around $() every time I want to use it.
[08:07:56] <DeltaHeavy> I feel like there shold be another way to do this though.
[08:08:42] <softplay> brunoais it doesn't throw any error
[08:08:44] <softplay> 200 OK
[08:08:44] <softplay> 		960ms
[08:09:13] <softplay> it just doesn't get the response json in the success function
[08:09:14] <brunoais> softplay, what is the complete output? gist or past it pls
[08:09:34] <brunoais> don't paste in this channel
[08:09:39] <softplay> yes it is the complete output of the console
[08:10:39] <brunoais> softplay, what is the output from the server?
[08:11:26] <brunoais> brb
[08:12:18] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: I think you'll end up losing a lot of what jQuery can do with that approach.
[08:12:42] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Why?
[08:13:11] <BillCriswell> With the second approach if you wanted to do like nav.addClass('foo') it wouldn't work.
[08:13:26] <BillCriswell> Basically anything jQuery related on the collection itself.
[08:14:44] <softplay> brunoais http://bpaste.net/show/pqpmkk23goiYGCEGgXNU/
[08:15:35] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Trying to figure out why that is right now
[08:16:57] <BillCriswell> I believe it'll end up a big headache in the long run with the second approach. I understand not wanting to do $(this) a lot but I'm sure it's like that for a reason haha
[08:20:57] <softplay> brunoais it is received but i'm reading it like a string
[08:21:02] <softplay> not like an object
[08:21:09] <softplay> that's the problem
[08:21:14] <softplay> i'll fix it thanks
[08:24:18] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Point taken, I'll use method 1
[08:44:49] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah my brain is fried.
[08:48:14] <duch_kazatel> anybody here familiar with currying?
[08:48:37] <bberry> somewhat
[08:48:59] <bberry> i havent use it extensively, just a couple things here any there
[08:49:05] <bberry> and, too
[08:49:09] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[08:49:41] <duch_kazatel> really glad i bought JavaScript: The Good Parts - really highlighting some things I feel like I should know but don't!  i'm having a rough time grokking currying
[08:50:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm searching around looking at examples but trying to understand practical applications for it.
[08:50:34] <bberry> it isn't the easiest thing to read... there was an online article that is pretty good though. ill try to find it
[08:50:48] <brunoais> bberry, ping me if oyu find it pls
[08:50:59] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Well.. you’ve probably played with Function#bind, no?
[08:51:20] <duch_kazatel> Function#bind?
[08:51:37] <systemfault> In JS
[08:52:40] <systemfault> Like… function multiply(x, y) { return x * y; } var multiplyByTwo = multiply.bind(null, 2); [1,2,3,4].map(multiplyByTwo);
[08:53:39] <duch_kazatel> aaah Function.prototype.bind() - give it a specific value for this, right?
[08:54:13] <systemfault> That’s one of its purposes
[08:54:24] <systemfault> The second is to bind arguments…. to do currying
[08:54:27] <systemfault> Like in my example.
[08:54:46] <systemfault> f(x, y) -> f(y)
[08:55:40] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah
[08:58:54] <duch_kazatel> okay that makes a bit more sense - basically having a way to further abstract.  i can make a generic function (like multiply), then create a partial function that basically supplies one or more default arguments for me.
[08:59:02] <duch_kazatel> right?
[08:59:07] <systemfault> Yes.
[08:59:12] <duch_kazatel> awesome.  thank you.
[08:59:19] <systemfault> You’re welcome.
[09:00:07] <bberry> duch_kazatel, brunoais: http://benalman.com/news/2012/09/partial-application-in-javascript/
[09:00:28] <bberry> its pretty long, but this seemed to make things 'click' for me
[09:00:32] <duch_kazatel> of COURSE ben_alman wrote about it.
[09:00:59] <bberry> :P
[09:01:03] <bberry> naturally
[09:01:13] <brunoais> bberry, queued for later. thanks
[09:01:19] <bberry> np
[09:03:38] <Jacta> Can anyone tell me why my form submit aint get halted here: http://9l.dk/rfromv2/?page=booking - try to click "ikke lokket ind" in right corner - then "log ind" - that form is posted :/
[09:04:20] <Jacta> used preventDefault to try stopping it, no luck - but im catching the .submit fine by posting e
[09:04:40] <duch_kazatel> Jacta try e.stopImmediatePropagation() instead?
[09:05:27] <Jacta> Its worth trying, never had any problems though
[09:05:43] <duch_kazatel> for the record, I'm not seeing the post happen myself.
[09:06:20] <Jacta> Here it reload the page and also sends xhr :/
[09:06:26] <shoky> Jacta it's just calling  location.reload();
[09:06:54] <Jacta> seems like something could have broken my output from my postdata
[09:07:02] <shoky> also i don't think you can do event delegation like this  $('#uniModal').on('submit', $('form', '#LoginContainer'), function(e) {
[09:07:12] <softplay> how do i make an ajax success function return an array and store this array in a variable?
[09:07:22] <Jacta> shooky seems to work fine
[09:07:31] <duch_kazatel> bberry ++ that article is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.
[09:07:33] <JustMozzy> hey guys. anyone knows his way around jqzoom? I'm trying to temporarily disable the zoom. According to some stack exchagnes they say to call the disable function on jqzoom, however this doesn't do anything. anyone has an idea?
[09:07:40] <duch_kazatel> softplay in the .done() callback.
[09:07:41] <shoky> Jacta: other forms will also trigger it i believe
[09:07:52] <shoky> Jacta: the 2nd argument needs to be a selector
[09:08:04] <softplay> i've done it but it returns an object not an array
[09:08:18] <softplay> i'll paste the code duch_kazatel
[09:08:23] <duch_kazatel> please do.
[09:08:34] <Jacta> shoky, okay, let me try :)
[09:08:37] <bberry> duch_kazatel np! :D
[09:09:17] <softplay> http://bpaste.net/show/v6A22SD6ETxu53iQrAyy/
[09:09:43] <shoky> Jacta: that won't change much though, probably. i didn't understand what the problem is
[09:09:57] <duch_kazatel> softplay don't use new Array() - just use an array literal.
[09:10:40] <Jacta> shoky, problem was the selector you just mentioned, try reload and see
[09:10:54] <Jacta> It did'nt send my form with the postdata - cause of the selector
[09:11:06] <duch_kazatel> softplay also, you can just do if (result.length) {
[09:11:19] <shoky> Jacta: ah k
[09:12:21] <duch_kazatel> softplay and finally, listpages.push(result[i].title); - instead of listpages.push(i.title);
[09:12:59] <duch_kazatel> so it'll looks something like this: http://bpaste.net/show/rXgGprRuvANCx7v7vMJd/
[09:17:34] <softplay> dutch_kazatel availableTags
[09:17:34] <softplay> 	Object { readyState=1, setRequestHeader=function(), getAllResponseHeaders=function(), altri elementi...}
[09:18:19] <duch_kazatel> softplay hrm?
[09:18:48] <shoky> ?ajax101
[09:18:50] <b-ot> shoky: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[09:18:53] <softplay> it doesn't change
[09:18:54] <shoky> softplay ^
[09:19:02] <softplay> it is still an ajax object
[09:19:06] <softplay> not an array
[09:19:32] <BillCriswell> Not sure there's enough ads on tinypic.com
[09:19:50] <shoky> softplay: ajax is asynchronous. you don't return stuff from it. you use the result in the callbacks
[09:20:11] <duch_kazatel> softplay it looks like you're trying to read listpages arbitrarily after availableTags.  you need to define your callbacks and pass it around.
[09:20:14] <BillCriswell> I can *almost* focus on the content. I doubt they want that.
[09:20:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell just enough to keep you coming back.
[09:21:21] <softplay> shoky so i should use the availableTags in the callback?
[09:21:23] <BillCriswell> I'm pretty sure I'd rather set myself on fire.
[09:21:31] <duch_kazatel> softplay no, you use listPages.
[09:21:33] <softplay> directly?
[09:21:44] <RecoJohnson> I am having trouble grabbing a FormData object with jQuery and sending it to a php file. The php file is responding that no file was uploaded. Please review my syntax if you can: https://gist.github.com/btiessen/e91a7e1c3df0d9d4ce59
[09:21:44] <softplay> yes i'm sorry listpages
[09:22:21] <systemfault> RecoJohnson: You cannot upload files with jQuery or even XHR1
[09:22:32] <systemfault> You need XHR2 + FileAPI.
[09:22:50] <RecoJohnson> systemfault: Does jQuery not support XHR2?
[09:22:56] <shoky> softplay: the closest you can get to how you wanted it is:  http://bpaste.net/show/uAOnZ7y3aBVM83KgXdca/
[09:23:21] <duch_kazatel> softplay also, you'll want to check that for loop.  that looks wrong/.
[09:23:42] <shoky> softplay: the .then callback "transforms" the result into the listpages thing you return. then in the callback in the bottom it already passes the listpages you created in the .then
[09:24:09] <shoky> and yeah something is off about that if/for
[09:24:14] <duch_kazatel> http://bpaste.net/show/sEBbEHzdpKqvK9UpnlcR/
[09:24:17] <duch_kazatel> probably closer to this.
[09:24:18] <shoky> decide if it's an array or not ;p
[09:24:22] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:24:35] <systemfault> RecoJohnson: Nope… The only way to do “async” file transfers on older browsers is with a hidden iframe…..
[09:24:57] <NoiseEee> RecoJohnson: you can adjust it to send a file
[09:24:58] <systemfault> RecoJohnson: I think there’s a plugin called “jquery-iframe-transport” for that…
[09:25:09] <NoiseEee> RecoJohnson: one moment
[09:26:11] <softplay> shoky a need to change a global variable with the content of the response of the ajax call
[09:26:23] <duch_kazatel> softplay that's a bad idea btw :)
[09:26:24] <shoky> softplay: nah no you don't
[09:26:48] <softplay> why is it bad?
[09:26:54] <shoky> and if you really really do, then you can, by just doing it ;p but you have to make sure you access it only after the ajax call is done
[09:27:07] <duch_kazatel> softplay define your callbacks and use them.  otherwise you'll pollute the global namespace and run into race conditions.
[09:27:08] <softplay> it is the source data for an other part of the ajax script
[09:27:20] <softplay> you mean that i should do the work "server side"?
[09:27:21] <shoky> that's fine. just do the other stuff in a .done callback
[09:27:26] <shoky> no
[09:27:28] <duch_kazatel> no, do it all in the .done()
[09:27:39] <duch_kazatel> or in a callback that you call from .done()
[09:28:40] <softplay> mumble i've to find the right manner to do what you advice me to do..
[09:28:59] <shoky> you can call request.done(..)  as many times as you want
[09:29:18] <shoky> stick it anywhere that has access to "request"
[09:29:42] <NoiseEee> RecoJohnson:   data: formData   not file:formData
[09:30:12] <RecoJohnson> NoiseEee: I will give that a try.
[09:30:47] <duch_kazatel> softplay you can also do something like this: http://bpaste.net/show/YxVhWDpkh4lA75xVodnu/
[09:30:56] <RecoJohnson> NoiseEee: As soon as I did that, i started getting "Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation".
[09:31:19] <NoiseEee> RecoJohnson: this is snippet of what works for me https://gist.github.com/NoiseEee/5efd478544366cdff346
[09:31:57] <systemfault> Too bad that FormData is part of XHR2…
[09:31:57] <RecoJohnson> NoiseEee: Here is my updated not-working snippet: https://gist.github.com/btiessen/e91a7e1c3df0d9d4ce59
[09:32:56] <NoiseEee> systemfault: it doesnt matter, its the browser that supports that not the library
[09:33:47] <NoiseEee> RecoJohnson: try combining mine is, see what happens.
[09:34:24] <RecoJohnson> NoiseEee: I got it working with yours, I am an idiot. I didn't specify "POST" it was trying to send a file through get...
[09:34:33] <NoiseEee> RecoJohnson: sweet :)
[09:35:48] <systemfault> RecoJohnson: As long as you don’t need to support IE version less than 10, you’re fine.
[09:36:50] <RecoJohnson> systemfault: IE10 customers not worth the money. Thanks!
[09:36:59] <systemfault> :)
[09:37:06] <duch_kazatel> i wish i could say that
[09:37:14] <systemfault> same.
[09:37:47] <systemfault> We’re thinking about not supporting IE8… but it’s not done yet.
[09:37:50] <systemfault> (At work)
[09:37:56] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[09:38:09] <bberry> ditto
[09:38:37] <bberry> actually, its more like im trying convince everyone to allow me to not support ie8, but one of our customers use it, so its an ongoing battle.
[09:39:29] <systemfault> IE8 is the last crap browser from our friends at MS… Can’t wait to ditch it.
[09:39:58] <systemfault> 2014… No RGBA, no :last-child, no addEventListener...
[09:40:17] <duch_kazatel> the only gripe I have with 9 at this point is the last of pushstate support
[09:40:51] <systemfault> Can’t wait to actually start using SVG
[09:40:55] <systemfault> And canvas.
[09:41:18] <NoiseEee> it takes effort to be stuck on 8 or 9
[09:42:01] <systemfault> IE8 is a CSS2 browser… it doesn’t have a HTML5 parser...
[09:43:37] <Uhkis> doesn't html5shiv do a pretty good job to make up for it
[09:44:27] <systemfault> Uhkis: So so. I had bugs with it and dynamic content having HTML5 tags.
[09:44:44] <systemfault> But just to render a static html5 page, html5shiv is fine.
[09:44:55] <systemfault> Well.. I use modernizr, not html5shiv
[09:45:02] <systemfault> (modernizr has it bundled)
[09:45:16] <duch_kazatel> does it?  i thought modernizr only did detection.
[09:45:50] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[09:46:10] <systemfault> I think it’s bundled as an extra… with yepnope.
[09:46:20] <duch_kazatel> aye.  not required.
[09:48:32] <BillCriswell> Just figured out something accidentally lol
[09:49:29] <Jattenalle> do tell
[09:49:55] <BillCriswell> background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(20, 0, 0, 1), rgba(0, 0, 0, .1)) followed by a tab in sublime text gives you prefixed versions of things.
[09:50:05] <BillCriswell> Just confused the shit out of me.
[09:50:13] <Jattenalle> lol

[10:15:02] <RandalSchwartz> giving testimonials about product being seen
[10:15:08] <star_prone> if, on the other hand, i submit it via .submit() method, the data received will not contain the submit button itself
[10:15:28] <star_prone> is there a way to also submit the value of the submit button>
[10:15:31] <star_prone> ?
[10:16:07] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ star_prone
[10:16:07] <b-ot> star_prone: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:16:18] <star_prone> :)
[10:16:19] <star_prone> ok
[10:16:20] <star_prone> thanks
[10:18:01] <bberry> im surprised there wasnt a huge hubbub about someone putting [preferred] by jsfiddle like there was in ##javascript
[10:18:07] <bberry> ./facepalm
[10:21:16] <duch_kazatel> probably because we don't get into overly pedantic arguments where we conflate opinion with fact ;)
[10:22:12] <bberry> lol definitely
[10:22:45] <bberry> and i thank all of you for that
[10:23:07] <BillCriswell> Wonder why fiddle is preferred.
[10:23:13] <decx> yeah right, and that is coming from duch_kazatel lol
[10:23:17] <duch_kazatel> right?!
[10:23:38] <bberry> :P
[10:23:55] <decx> that's because fiddle is good
[10:24:01] <duch_kazatel> i was going to ask my currying question in there earlier, but realized that I'd either get derided, unhelpful answers, and tons of reading material.  asking in here got me the answer.
[10:24:02] <decx> unlike jsbin :>
[10:24:47] <bberry> i like what jsbin tried to do. i really do. but for some reason the layout is uncomfortable.
[10:24:57] <duch_kazatel> and to be fair, sometimes i really do have a hard time understanding what people are asking.  i try really hard not to be a dick!  wheaton's law and all that.
[10:24:57] <BillCriswell> I still prefer bin.
[10:25:51] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell any particular reason you prefer bin?
[10:26:10] <decx> i like that i can just 'run' on fiddle
[10:26:34] <decx> keeps the versions lean
[10:26:34] <BillCriswell> I really like the auto reload and that I can toggle it easily.
[10:26:56] <decx> that's the part that i hate ^^
[10:27:13] <BillCriswell> That you have the option?
[10:27:25] <bberry> duch_kazatel yeah, if theres one thing ive learned about sitting in here and ##javascript is that a lot of people (including me, probably) have a hard time really expressing what their question truly is.
[10:27:29] <decx> that i have to untick first
[10:28:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah, that's reasonable I guess.
[10:28:12] <duch_kazatel> bberry that makes sense i think.
[10:28:34] <bberry> lots of XY problems. or just confusing explanations.
[10:28:42] <bberry> or just 'it doesnt work'
[10:29:03] <duch_kazatel> probably doesn't help that we get a lot of non programmers trying to write code and tons of code by google.
[10:29:50] <bberry> we all started out at some point as a non-programmer i suppose :P
[10:30:06] <duch_kazatel> definitely.  still doesn't do anything for the help vampires.
[10:30:19] <duch_kazatel> or the people who try to not learn.
[10:30:22] <bberry> oh man, and then theres the ones that refuse to take your help
[10:30:23] <bberry> yeah
[10:31:15] <drej> bberry you cant tell me what to do
[10:31:18] <drej> you're not my real father
[10:31:29] <bberry> lol
[10:31:40] <duch_kazatel> and then there's drej.
[10:31:48] * drej waves
[10:32:33] <decx> now i have that maude theme in my head come on
[10:35:30] <VictorCL> what does  val() return when an input hasnt being filled?
[10:35:36] <VictorCL> undefined,null or empty string?
[10:35:40] <duch_kazatel> empty string.
[10:35:43] <bberry> ""
[10:35:47] <VictorCL> ok thanks
[10:36:16] <bberry> is there a bot in here like in ##javascript for executing short bits of code
[10:36:27] <duch_kazatel> b-ot doesn't have that enabled.
[10:36:33] <bberry> gotcha
[10:36:33] <lexbuck> I've got a little issue that my novice knowledge of jQuery won't allow me to resolve. Please bear with me as I try to explain. On my site, I have a link which allows "liking" of something. Once liked, it adds an entry to the database via ajax and changes the link to say "unlike?" Here's my full "liking" javascript file: https://dpaste.de/D0gH. Here's the bit of code that I've added myself to that file: https://dpaste.de/M7Yi and here's the bit of HTML
[10:36:34] <lexbuck>  where I'm passing some data to my .js file: https://dpaste.de/Q15V. The code in question: https://dpaste.de/GUQ2. If I comment everything out except the "if" bit at the top, then it works. What that does is tries to find if an anchor exists with a title that contains a username of the logged in user. It works. If I comment out the if at the top and only run the if/else at the bottom, it works fine and what it's doing is dynamically adding a new <li> to
[10:36:34] <lexbuck>  the list once "like" is clicked. The problem is getting both to work together. Each chunk of code works by itself, but not when I try to combine them. I can try to explain further or fill in any blanks if someone would like to take a stab at why my code isn't working
[10:36:36] <duch_kazatel> i don't think at least.
[10:36:39] <duch_kazatel> woahdang
[10:36:40] <bberry> holy moly
[10:36:41] <VictorCL> xD
[10:36:56] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck that's... pretty long.
[10:37:04] <VictorCL> this aint a forum
[10:37:28] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck let's start over - could you put a working example in a fiddle?
[10:37:55] <duch_kazatel> or otherwise pair down your question?
[10:38:17] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Sorry... I got a little carried away. I'm not sure I can get it working in jsfiddle but I could try if that would help
[10:38:33] <duch_kazatel> could you rephrase your question down into a sentence or two?
[10:38:39] <duch_kazatel> because that's a whole lotta text.
[10:40:20] <duch_kazatel> also, for the folks keeping score on Angular, Backbone, React, Web Components, and other similar ideas: http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome
[10:41:11] <decx> wasnt that article much more reactionary like 2 hours ago? remove all libs
[10:41:21] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Ok, so basically I have a link to "like" a comment. When someone clicks "like" it should append some data to a UL. Problem is, if the item is already "liked" and I click "unlike" it wasn't working so I added code to remove the LI when "unliked" is clicked. These two snippets of code work individually, but not together. so I can either get one or the other to work
[10:42:00] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck so you're having an issue knowing how to maintain state and bind yur handlers?
[10:42:38] <duch_kazatel> decx hrm?
[10:42:40] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Honestly, I'm really new to jquery and I don't have any idea what you just said. I'm not sure if that's my issue or not
[10:44:00] <decx> duch_kazatel i read that article a few hours ago and then it was still leading with "remove all libs there's too much shit" the react push didn't really shine through unless you read the whole tihng so the author changed the article up
[10:44:20] <duch_kazatel> decx aaaah.
[10:44:31] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck could you make the fiddle then?
[10:45:02] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck because your basic question is extremely simple.
[10:45:14] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: No, I don't think so. I'm working on a python/django site and for the actual functionality to work, it uses some django tags
[10:46:15] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: This is the code I'm working with (if this helps): https://dpaste.de/TJRS. The first if works and the second if/else works but they don't work together like this. They only work when one or the other is commented out.
[10:46:19] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck you should be able to create a simplified example.  let me see what I can dpo.
[10:46:53] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck can you supply some rendered markup?
[10:48:27] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: This help? https://dpaste.de/bKB6
[10:49:40] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck this explains a few things.
[10:51:02] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck what's up with the .data() attributes?
[10:52:17] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: This is the only way I could successfully pass a few things to the javascript. For example, I'm passing the current logged in user over which is a django tag for grabbing that). request.user.username isn't available outside of the templates
[10:52:57] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Sorry, they didn't translate right in my paste
[10:53:14] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: the username should be a django tag: {{ request.user.username }}
[10:56:52] <duch_kazatel> sorry was away for a second.
[10:57:20] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck yeah it's really hard to be able to help without a more complete example of what you're trying to do.
[10:57:30] <duch_kazatel> maybe somebody else can decipher it?
[10:59:37] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Ok, thanks for looking. I seems really simple but I understand in the current form it's near impossible.
[11:00:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm sure the issue you're having is very simple, but the description and samples you're giving out are hard to understand. that's why i was asking for a fiddle earlier with all relevant bits in it.
[11:01:32] <shoky> lexbuck: if (anchor_title)   is wrong
[11:01:54] <shoky> lexbuck: anchor_title is a jquery object, it'll always be truthy
[11:02:35] <shoky> and anyway you don't need to check before calling jquery methods on it.. uh but that shouldn't be causing any problems
[11:05:00] <lexbuck> shoky: Hmm.. ok. I'm not sure how it's always true? In my novice brain, it looks to me that it's only true when there's an anchor with a title containing "username" (which would just be the logged in user
[11:05:10] <duch_kazatel> objects are always true.
[11:05:53] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck so even if you do var $ninjas = $('a.someNonexistentClassName'); , $ninjas is truthy because it's an empty jquery object.
[11:06:27] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: shoky: Ok. So could I test against the text of the anchor then? Since if it's "unliked" then the anchor is <a>unlike</a>
[11:06:49] <shoky> test what
[11:07:35] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/9/ Could someone help me figure out how to get the values of these sliders? There are areas on here where I must create some formulas from the values of some of these items that will auto populate other areas on the page. But they all need to update in live time depending on other values. I can't figure out how to get these values.
[11:08:05] <lexbuck> shoky: for my conditional. I need to test and see if the object has already been liked or not. If it's been liked, I need to remove the <li> when clicked. So I need to do something if the object is already liked and do something else if it's not yet liked
[11:08:06] <duch_kazatel> phelix woah - you have jquery included twice on that page.
[11:08:26] <phelix> ahh. my bad. Its not in my original just here.
[11:08:58] <shoky> lexbuck:  that "if" doesn't even have an "else" , i don't see how it was doing what you just said..
[11:09:44] <shoky> lexbuck: you can just do: anchor_title.closest('li').remove();    without checking if it exists first
[11:09:56] <shoky> jquery is forgiving
[11:10:19] <shoky> and if you did want to explicitly check if it exists, you'd do:   if (anchor_title.length > 0)    for example
[11:10:30] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/13/ this is where you start :)
[11:11:20] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Awesome thank you!
[11:12:03] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Wait, thats exactly how I had it
[11:12:15] <lexbuck> shoky: Well, in my mind, it shouldn't need an else because the only way that the if would be triggered was if there was an achor tag with a title that contained the logged in user's username (which you informed me wasn't going to work.)
[11:12:17] <duch_kazatel> phelix nope - you had the doctype, body, head, etc.
[11:12:19] <phelix> my example at the bottom of the js area isn't giving me the value
[11:12:36] <phelix> ohh yes on the jsfiddle. Its more correct on my actual page.
[11:12:52] <phelix> but you fixed it in the fiddle to look properly :)
[11:12:53] <duch_kazatel> phelix trying to show you how to better use jsfiddle :)
[11:13:00] <duch_kazatel> not just look, work.
[11:13:09] <phelix> I c. yes. I always mess my fiddles up lol
[11:13:15] <lexbuck> shoky: let me try what you suggested
[11:13:41] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're really munging stuff up here.
[11:13:51] <phelix> how?
[11:14:44] <duch_kazatel> you keep repeating the same bits of code over and over.  you could easily do an .each() to accomplish largely the same thing.
[11:15:10] <lexbuck> shoky: The problem is when I try this: https://dpaste.de/GPVR it's removeing the <li> and then instantly re-adding it due to the if/else below
[11:15:35] <duch_kazatel> phelix either way, you should be able to do $("#five-2").val() iirc.
[11:15:44] <duch_kazatel> just reference the thing you initialized and get the val.
[11:16:06] <shoky> lexbuck: ok..? it's doing what the code is telling it to do, no?
[11:16:25] <lexbuck> shoky: Yes, it is. But that's my whole problem I don't know how to get it to stop doing that. ;)
[11:17:06] <shoky> i'm sure if you delete that code it won't run.
[11:17:27] <shoky> ~next
[11:17:33] <shoky> :\
[11:17:40] <lexbuck> shoky: I apologize.. I must be doing a terrible job explaining here
[11:17:57] <shoky> lexbuck: to be fair, i haven't really read most of your explanation above
[11:18:23] <phelix> duch_kazatel I can do  var val = $("#three-1").val(); console.log(val); and I get an empty string
[11:18:25] <shoky> but.. who has.
[11:18:35] <duch_kazatel> phelix where are you doing that?
[11:18:39] <duch_kazatel> err, no underline lol
[11:19:01] <lexbuck> shoky: To try to break it down, I have two situations: 1. If the object is already "liked" then I need to do the remove. 2. If the object has not been liked yet, then I need to do the .append()
[11:19:13] <shoky> lexbuck: "liked" means nothing to me
[11:19:50] <VictorCL> this still works like this ? $.mobile.loading('hide')
[11:19:55] <VictorCL> that will hide the loading icon ?
[11:20:01] <phelix> duch_kazatel: here. http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/17/
[11:20:26] <lexbuck> shoky: when a user clicks "like" on my site, it processes this file: https://dpaste.de/SYGo which adds data to the database. I'm then grabbing that data and displaying it in a list (.append)
[11:20:38] <duch_kazatel> phelix right, because the value hasn't been set yet.
[11:20:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix you mean you're trying to figure out how to callback to another function to update things?
[11:20:49] <lexbuck> shoky: When the user clicks "unlike" it should remove the li from the list
[11:20:57] <phelix> but when I slide it, its not updating
[11:21:07] <phelix> yeah, as the slider changes I need to get the changed value
[11:21:10] <duch_kazatel> phelix you need to add taht to each slide: callback.
[11:21:29] <duch_kazatel> phelix --> http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/18/
[11:22:26] <phelix> ahh ok so inside each of those can I do like var val1 = (ui.value); ?
[11:22:37] <shoky> lexbuck: that code runs only on "like"? not on unlike?
[11:22:39] <duch_kazatel> phelix you have to define it within those callbacks, yes.
[11:22:41] <phelix> then at the bottom I  can apply my formula using the variables that I set?
[11:22:46] <phelix> ok
[11:22:50] <duch_kazatel> phelix no.
[11:22:57] <lexbuck> shoky: No it does both. Run when like/unliked is clicked.
[11:23:08] <duch_kazatel> phelix you can't "apply your formula".  you need to create a function that you call back to that changes things.
[11:23:25] <myosotis> how can I get the all but the first 20 element of $('div.block');
[11:24:07] <duch_kazatel> myosotis http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[11:24:28] <duch_kazatel> myosotis or use .splice()
[11:24:34] <myosotis> yeah I just found splice
[11:24:44] <myosotis> thanks for the tips, this channel is always helpful
[11:24:49] <phelix> so if I add say var amountThree2 = (ui.value); and var amountThree1 = (ui.value); inside each of those callbacks. and then add this up below I can use another function that will update that value ?
[11:25:07] <phelix> and it will change it in live time as the sliders change correct?
[11:25:12] <duch_kazatel> phelix no, because the function "below" will never run.
[11:25:19] <phelix> ohh
[11:25:22] <duch_kazatel> you must explicitly call that function within the callback.
[11:25:44] <phelix> hmm
[11:25:46] <shoky> lexbuck: and how do you know whether it was "like" or "unlike" that was clicked?
[11:26:26] <umax> how i can use addClass or removeClass if i have multiple <div>s with the same id .... man
[11:26:28] <phelix> would you mind showing me an example?
[11:26:44] <duch_kazatel> umax only one div can only ever have an ID.
[11:26:58] <duch_kazatel> phelix the console.log() example should explain it pretty well.
[11:27:03] <duch_kazatel> replace console.log() with your function.
[11:27:30] <lexbuck> shoky: That was the reason for the conditionals I was attempting to use. "if there's an <a> with a title tag that contains X" then that means someone is "unliking" because otherwise there will be no anchor tag with a title containing the username of the logged in user
[11:27:45] <phelix> but I have to add multiple fields together. adding the function inside one of those callbacks will only give me the value of one item.
[11:27:58] <duch_kazatel> phelix right - you have to do it in all of them.
[11:28:05] <umax> duch_kazatel than lets say i have 10 <p> how i know i want removeClass from the 5th p and add to the 2nd p for example ... so ?
[11:28:42] <shoky> lexbuck: and what is this supposed to be checking?  if ($(child_li).hasClass(itemId))
[11:28:44] <phelix> so call a function in each one that updates the field I want. And add this function that does this math below at bottom of the .js ?
[11:29:08] <duch_kazatel> phelix yes - you need to do both.
[11:29:15] <phelix> ok let me try that
[11:29:21] <duch_kazatel> umax try :eq() or .get()
[11:29:28] <duch_kazatel> or :nth-child()
[11:29:33] <duch_kazatel> lots of choices.
[11:30:30] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck http://jsfiddle.net/v94gG/
[11:30:31] <shoky> lexbuck:  and what's the difference between the 2 .remove()s , why both
[11:30:35] <duch_kazatel> this is the basic gist of what you're trying to do.
[11:30:47] <shoky> lexbuck: walk me through https://dpaste.de/GUQ2 ..
[11:31:19] <shoky> i see duch has deciphered, yay
[11:31:54] <duch_kazatel> as far as I can tell, this is what they want.
[11:33:10] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Thanks. Given my noobness, this code isn't making much sense. how is "currentaction" determined?
[11:33:40] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck by looking at $this.attr('id')
[11:34:04] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:34:25] <duch_kazatel> $this is $(this) in this case.  $(this) is the clicked anchor.
[11:35:16] <ophi491> if I have a .js file in an iframe with a setInterval function in the file will it keep executing before a promise in the html file that contains the iframe is resolved?
[11:35:17] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: And "!hasLike" does what?
[11:35:43] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck what do you think it does?
[11:36:04] <ophi491> it is a chrome extensions so the .js file is sandboxed
[11:37:20] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: So it checks the value of the anchor? So if the value is "like" then process the first conditional?
[11:37:34] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck no value anywhere.
[11:37:50] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck this checks the ID of the link in each case.
[11:37:56] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: Isn't the value of the anchor: <a href="#" id="like">Like!</a> in this case "Like"
[11:38:06] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck again, no "value" checkl.
[11:38:08] <duch_kazatel> *check
[11:38:20] <duch_kazatel> currentAction = $this.attr('id'),
[11:38:25] <duch_kazatel> that looks at the id of the clicked link.
[11:38:26] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: I thought currentAction === 'like' checked the id?
[11:38:33] <duch_kazatel> right.
[11:38:54] <duch_kazatel> so if (currentAction === 'like' && !hasLike) { checks to see if the ID is 'like' AND if NOT hasLike
[11:39:22] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I know i did not do it right but am I on the right track here? http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/19/
[11:39:45] <duch_kazatel> phelix nope.
[11:39:50] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: I don't get what "hasLike" is. That makes no sense to me.
[11:39:52] <phelix> created function at bottom and tried to apply it on line 107
[11:40:27] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck that's this: hasLike = $theUL.find('.like').length;
[11:40:34] <duch_kazatel> what about that snippet is confusing?
[11:40:59] <duch_kazatel> phelix no.
[11:41:05] <phelix> =/
[11:41:17] <duch_kazatel> you're binding your logic and data together wayyyy too much.
[11:41:19] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: ok,I didn't see that variable there. But to answer you question, it's all confusing when you're new. :)
[11:41:49] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck it's hard for me to know how to help you when I don't know what you're struggling with, and I'd really rather not step through line-by-line to explain it ;)
[11:42:26] <duch_kazatel> phelix let's pair this down a bit - that OK?
[11:42:38] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: No worries. I appreciate what you've done. I'm just not sure I can take what you have an translate it into something I can use. No doubt it's possible, but with my knowledge, it just doesn't make enough sense to me i don't think
[11:42:52] <duch_kazatel> lexbuck right, which is why i'm trying to help you understand the code.
[11:45:50] <phelix> duch_kazatel: yes please lol
[11:47:46] <umax> what is the equivalent of document.getElementById
[11:48:01] <duch_kazatel> $('#idGoesHgere');
[11:48:48] <bberry> finally just finished my first library ive put up on github
[11:49:03] <bberry> inb4 not a single pull request for its entire lifetime
[11:49:08] <bberry> or download, rather
[11:49:26] <umax> duch_kazatel = [object Object]  and document.getElementById gives [object HTMLInputElement]  so not same
[11:49:48] <DeltaHeavy> umax: It returns a jQuery object, not the straight up element. A jQ element can be used just like a normal JS element object though.
[11:49:58] <duch_kazatel> umax rephrase the question, because they do different things, but will largely do the same in use.
[11:50:23] <bberry> $(document.getElementById('yourID')) and $("#yourID") return the same thing
[11:50:25] <DeltaHeavy> As far as you should be concerned they're the same unless you're '$("#this") === document.getElementById("that")'
[11:51:28] <umax> duch_kazatel (reprase here) : how should is replace this "document.getElementById("fileInput");" with jquery so my full code still works.
[11:52:04] <umax> duch_kazatel because when i replace it with above said my code no more work .
[11:52:04] <DeltaHeavy> Not sure without looking at your code, but $('#fileInput') should work
[11:52:07] <duch_kazatel> umax dunno - i'd need to see more of your code to understand what you want to do.
[11:52:49] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/EkF3K/20/
[11:53:04] <bberry> access to attributes using jquery elements is different.
[11:53:27] <bberry> So that is probably / could be why your code isnt working anymore
[11:53:54] <duch_kazatel> phelix applying that code to your original html should be trivial.
[11:54:11] <umax> duch_kazatel  , http://pastebin.com/QDGBbi8p should be enough
[11:54:37] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ umax
[11:54:37] <b-ot> umax: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:55:00] <BeBoo> Not sure where to ask this but when you scroll down, it's kind of jumpy. Is there anything I can do to make it less jumpy? I assume it's because I am changing #head to fixed causing the page to jump higher than it normally sits. http://beta.serverby6ix.com/
[11:55:03] <bberry> lol my company blocks pastebin, so stupid.
[11:55:22] <hypfer> uhm. hi
[11:55:30] <duch_kazatel> umax a more complete examly would be really helpful.
[11:55:31] <umax> duch_kazatel should be enough http://jsfiddle.net/hnL9S/
[11:55:43] <phelix> duch_kazatel: K, let me check this out
[11:56:02] <duch_kazatel> umax some HTML too, please?
[11:56:17] <hypfer> I'm working on something. a web page in which I want to display verious icons on the right side. however they should not have fixed places but act more like.. well a stack. how do I archieve that?
[11:57:11] <duch_kazatel> phelix using this, you should be able to easily define more logic in your slide callback, but given what you're trying to do you should probably look at a more featureful data binding setup via backbone or riot or angular.
[11:57:20] <duch_kazatel> hypfer can't read your mind - have an example?
[11:57:48] <phelix> k.. let me play with what you have done here
[11:58:00] <duch_kazatel> phelix do you see the basics of what I've done?
[11:58:27] <phelix> yes I think so
[11:58:41] <phelix> I beleive I can get this to work now using this example. Thank you!
[11:59:14] <duch_kazatel> phelix be aware that can have a performance penalty if you're not careful.
[11:59:22] <duch_kazatel> also: i was able to apply currying today.  yay me!

[11:59:28] <bberry> wewt!
[11:59:30] <hypfer> duch_kazatel: http://i.imgur.com/s5ES05X.jpg see the grass icon? If that is not shown the wheat icon should be on the bottom
[12:00:17] <hypfer> also i'd like to extend that stack with more icons
[12:00:21] <hypfer> for different statuses
[12:01:58] <BillCriswell> Hm, just noticed moment does the same thing as jQuery with the whole .fn thing
[12:02:17] <duch_kazatel> hypfer that would be pretty simple.  vertical alignment and adding/removing
[12:02:39] <hypfer> duch_kazatel: any example on that or keywords for google?
[12:03:58] <umax> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/h7yFg/1/
[12:04:11] <umax> btw u can select a image.
[12:04:18] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:16:10] <duch_kazatel> umax wait why do you need to jquerify all of this in the first place?
[12:17:25] <ophi491> Does anyne know the best way to make asynchronous functions wait for promises to be resolved from separate sandboxed files?
[12:17:40] <umax> duch_kazatel well y it seems to be a hard proccess so let it js than ... btw did you tryed upload large images ? in some point you see the original size of image for a milisecond and than it resize .. can you tell me what that causes on which line ?
[12:18:04] <ophi491> I think I just need a lot of different postmessages but it will be helpful if anyone has done something similar
[12:19:01] <duch_kazatel> umax i mean... http://jsfiddle.net/h7yFg/3/
[12:19:19] <duch_kazatel> you could do this, but I don't understand the original reasoning.  as far as the resize thing, no clude.
[12:19:21] <duch_kazatel> *clue
[12:19:35] <duch_kazatel> don't have time ATM to step through it.
[12:26:26] <lexbuck> shoky: Sorry I to go tackle something else real quick. As for a walkthrough of my thought process on that code: 1. first conditional should only process if there's an anchor tag that has a title attribute containing the logged in user's username (which only happens if they've already "liked" the object). If it doesn't find that anchor tag, it should move to the second if/else. The if/else removes a li item with a class of itemID. If it doesn't find a LI
[12:26:26] <lexbuck>  item with a class of itemID, then it will append an <li> item to the html and gives it a class equal to the itemId
[12:27:23] <lexbuck> duch_kazatel: sorry I had something come up. Thanks for all of your help. I'm going to try to process this code tonight and see what I can get accomplished.
[12:34:23] <moparisthebest> so, it doesn't look like $('#someid') actually calls document.getElementById('someid'), what *does* it use?
[12:34:33] <moparisthebest> because I need to change the definition slightly :/
[12:36:45] <BillCriswell> moparisthebest: Sounds like some dangerous territory.
[12:37:22] <BillCriswell> moparisthebest: It might be using querySelectorAll under the hood? I know there's impimizations for selectors like #id but not sure what it ends up calling.
[12:37:30] <moparisthebest> BillCriswell: I agree, I don't have much of a choice here though
[12:37:46] <moparisthebest> I've overridden document.getElementById(), but that doesn't affect query I guess
[12:37:50] <moparisthebest> *jquery
[12:38:20] <BillCriswell> moparisthebest: Why would you do that?
[12:39:06] <moparisthebest> hehe, you want the entire story? I'll try to make it short
[12:39:09] <azk> Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to trigger jquery-ui's menu refresh method. http://jsfiddle.net/azkk/58KPb/10/ Not really sure how to actually trigger it.
[12:39:49] <moparisthebest> porting huge old app from weblogic to tomcat, weblogic portal prepends some IDs with a label, so id="bob" might turn out to be id="somerandomlabel.bob"
[12:39:58] <ophi491> does anyone have experience using promises with chrome.storage :S ?
[12:40:04] <RecoJohnson> When I run jQuery(".target-input").change(function() { ... how can I reference THIS which is referring to the clicked element with the class .target-input inside of the function?
[12:40:12] <moparisthebest> but, only in *some* places, so some of our javascript code uses "bob", some uses "label.bob"
[12:40:34] <moparisthebest> so, I'm overriding document.getElementById() to first search for the exact id, and if not found, prepend label.
[12:40:54] <moparisthebest> vs trying to change 1200ish JSPs without breaking anything....
[12:41:30] <BillCriswell> moparisthebest: It's not ideal by ANY means, but you can do $('[id]').filter(function() { return this.id === 'something.silly'; }) I imagine.
[12:42:35] <moparisthebest> hmm, I'll give that a shot then, and yes, 100% agree it's a total hack
[12:43:30] <BillCriswell> Could make it a little quicker if you know the type of element like div[id]
[12:44:03] <moparisthebest> can that function take the id sent in as a parameter, because I need to prepend it with the label
[12:44:27] <moparisthebest> also I'd have to do that every time I imported a new version of jquery right?  yes different pages use different versions of jquery :(
[12:44:33] <azk> Should I head somewhere else with jquery-ui questions?
[12:45:26] <BillCriswell> moparisthebest: Not sure I'm following.
[12:46:50] <moparisthebest> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/5ZYex/
[12:46:57] <moparisthebest> I need jquery to behave like that
[12:50:59] <RecoJohnson> How can I use the variable this inside of a jQuery(".select-this-class").change({this.toggle()});
[12:51:27] <RecoJohnson> How can I use the variable *this* inside of a jQuery(".select-this-class").change({*this*.toggle()});
[12:51:47] <Uhkis> jQuery(this)
[12:52:09] <jrajav> RecoJohnson: That's not a full function expression, you need function () { }
[12:52:37] <jrajav> Inside a function expression for a jQuery event handler, this will be set to the element the event triggered on
[12:56:58] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: sorry thats what I meant to type, but how can I access this inside of it?
[12:57:50] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: I need to access the classname element inside of it using this: jQuery(this).parentNode.append("<span class='error'>" + json.error + "</span>");
[12:58:04] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: Is *this* in the right place?
[12:58:40] <jrajav> Without seeing the context of that code, how are we supposed to know what "this" refers to?
[12:58:54] <jrajav> If you're expecting it to make sense just within that single line of code, then no, it probably isn't
[12:58:59] <maximski> can i somehow really quick make an element visible if some unknown parent has display: none; ?
[12:59:12] <jrajav> 'this' depends on the function it is referred to within
[12:59:35] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: https://gist.github.com/btiessen/ba3e2114f1f368a67300
[12:59:54] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: I am getting an eror trying to append an elemnt that doesnt exist even though there is a parent
[13:00:16] <jrajav> RecoJohnson: Yes, so there, you're probably expecting 'this' to be the element for the .change() event wrapping all of that, right?
[13:00:45] <jrajav> RecoJohnson: Except, 'this' depends on the current function context. You're in a different, nested function when you call 'this' for the last time
[13:01:15] <jrajav> RecoJohnson: What you need to do is assign 'this' to a variable (people usually call it 'that') in the outer function. That variable is then safe to refer to in nested functions
[13:01:18] <jrajav> var that = this;
[13:01:31] <jrajav> Or, you could name it a little more specifically to represent what it really is - an element
[13:01:32] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: Ok thanks thats what i needed to know.
[13:01:34] <jrajav> var $el = this;
[13:02:27] <alex88> hi guys, I've to create an embeddable js which imports js, css and html, is there a best practice or a common setup to do so?
[13:02:46] <paulvd> hello
[13:03:08] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: I updated the gist to match what you said.
[13:03:37] <jrajav> Hmm, seems as if you didn't fully understand
[13:03:42] <jrajav> 'that' is not a special variable
[13:03:46] <jrajav> However, 'this' is
[13:04:10] <jrajav> The idea is you can define your own variable called 'that' to capture the value of 'this' in one function, to use in a later nested function
[13:04:31] <jrajav> However, your example would work alright too if you simply change 'that' to be 'this' instead
[13:04:34] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: Ya sorry that was a typo i just didnt see it.
[13:04:41] <RecoJohnson> jrajav: Thanks for the help!
[13:04:43] <jrajav> np
[13:06:53] <duch_kazatel> alex88 your question stinks of an XY problem - mind stepping back and explaining the problem you're tryin to solve?
[13:07:56] <rocky> i don't suppose there's some popular opinion on which websocket js library is the best these days? or is it completely splintered opinions?
[13:08:11] <alex88> duch_kazatel: sure, I want to create an embeddable javascript that will be embedded in customers pages which will import css and html, like for example uservoice, you just embed the js script and it will create you a chat button with all its functionalities
[13:08:53] <alex88> I want to be able to use my own jquery version and other libraries in an unobtrusive way so it won't break things when it gets embedded in user pages
[13:09:30] <duch_kazatel> alex88 those don't normally "import" things.  they might write out a style tag or style everything inline (or both) and write out the HTML manually.
[13:09:38] <moparisthebest> http://jsfiddle.net/5ZYex/1/
[13:10:01] <moparisthebest> how do I make jquery use my custom document.getElementById, refer to the above page for what I'm talking about
[13:10:18] <alex88> duch_kazatel: ok, well, forget about css and html, I'll put them inline with server side scripts
[13:10:24] <duch_kazatel> moparisthebest put your javascript in the area demarcated for it.
[13:10:33] <alex88> I want to include in my own script some libraries and make them contained in my code
[13:10:48] <alex88> so they won't interfere with user code
[13:11:02] <r3v3rb> how would i get the response from this url as an ajax .get call : http://c1.websitealive.com/1857/status.asp?action=groupstatus&groupid=1857
[13:11:04] <duch_kazatel> alex88 only include the libs that you'll need.
[13:11:16] <alex88> duch_kazatel: ok, imagine I need just jquery
[13:11:16] <duch_kazatel> and only if they're not all ready available on the page.
[13:11:51] <alex88> duch_kazatel: well, also version matters
[13:12:05] <duch_kazatel> r3v3rb by proxying it through a server.
[13:12:35] <duch_kazatel> alex88 right, so you check to see what version is on the site and going from there.
[13:12:48] <alex88> imagine I need another one? I'll use noconflict
[13:13:21] <r3v3rb> duch_kazatel: proxying through server?
[13:13:29] <r3v3rb> sorry I’m a bit of a noob
[13:13:40] <duch_kazatel> alex88 and actually, you shouldn't include any libs if at all possible.
[13:13:48] <moparisthebest> duch_kazatel: I don't think it'll work like that because I need to override that function before any other javascript is executed
[13:14:18] <alex88> duch_kazatel: I know, but take again the uservoice example, doing all that work for a realtime chat for example could be so much plain javascript to achieve
[13:14:21] <alex88> without talking about browser compatibility
[13:14:37] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: one of your issues will no doubt be the problem of a . in an ID
[13:15:17] <moparisthebest> http://jsbin.com/wadiloci/1/ that might be a better site
[13:15:55] <moparisthebest> NoiseEee: is that not allowed?  weblogic portal does that by default, we are migrating away but need a stopgap so we don't have to change all 1200ish jsps all at once
[13:16:51] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: http://jsfiddle.net/5ZYex/3/
[13:17:37] <duch_kazatel> alex88 but they remove the effort of trying to reduce conflicts.
[13:17:40] <duch_kazatel> it also keeps size down.
[13:17:52] <duch_kazatel> r3v3rb you can't hit your URL with ajax directly
[13:18:03] <alex88> duch_kazatel: yup, well lets see what I figure out
[13:18:07] <alex88> thanks for the tips!
[13:18:20] <duch_kazatel> alex88 i worked on something like that a while ago.
[13:18:25] <r3v3rb> duch_kazatel: I can’t use $.get(“url”) across a domain?
[13:18:35] <duch_kazatel> r3v3rb you can if the other domain supports CORS.
[13:18:42] <duch_kazatel> the url supplied does not.
[13:18:47] <r3v3rb> ok
[13:19:07] <r3v3rb> then I’m knackered to get the response from the page via ajax then
[13:19:08] <moparisthebest> NoiseEee: ah yea, jquery handles . differently, however, it still doesn't use my getElementById, as I need #tom to find the label.tom div
[13:19:25] <duch_kazatel> you'd need to hit your server via ajax to make the request for you, which then ships the respons back.
[13:19:57] <NoiseEee> moparisthebest: can't see how that would happen.
[13:20:20] <r3v3rb> so from a statically published site out of a cms I would need to fire a function from a class in the CMS to get the response
[13:20:36] <DeltaHeavy> r3v3rb: You can make an AJAX request to a script on the same domain which queries the other server.
[13:21:03] <duch_kazatel> r3v3rb your workflow would be ajax to your box, your box requests resource, your box responds to your page with data.
[13:21:05] <r3v3rb> ok so have a generic php file to do a curl return that object as ajax call
[13:21:14] <moparisthebest> NoiseEee: I override document.getElementById just fine: http://jsbin.com/wadiloci/1/edit but query doesn't use it, what I can't find is what it *does* use so I can override that too
[13:21:15] <r3v3rb> go it
[13:21:16] <duch_kazatel> that's one way, sure.
[13:21:33] <r3v3rb> duch_kazatel: is there a better way?
[13:22:11] <duch_kazatel> r3v3rb sure - get the other box to allow CORS ;)
[13:22:20] <duch_kazatel> if you don't own that box, you're probably SOL.
[13:22:30] <r3v3rb> duch_kazatel: SOL indeed then :D
[13:22:34] <r3v3rb> so curl it is
[13:22:48] <moparisthebest> NoiseEee:  updated now, with backslash escaping of the period: http://jsbin.com/wadiloci/1/edit
[13:22:51] <duch_kazatel> moparisthebest why are you overriding basic APIs?
[13:23:42] <moparisthebest> duch_kazatel: it's a long story, but it's a choice between that and carefully editing 1200+ JSPs without breaking them
[13:24:11] <moparisthebest> basically, a page may or may not have a label prepended to the id
[13:24:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd do the edit instead of trying to modify basic browser APIs.
[13:24:29] <duch_kazatel> *apart of the browser API, I mean.
[13:24:46] <moparisthebest> eventually we'll get to change them all, but we need a bit of a stop gap in the mean time
[13:26:54] <moparisthebest> in jquery .js I see document.getElementById used, but I also see context.getElementById, and can't exactly trace where that's coming from
[13:29:48] <RecoJohnson> What does it mean to have jQuery(function(){}) , is function by default an object or something?
[13:30:30] <duch_kazatel> document ready basically.
[13:31:08] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You been watching Silicon Valley?
[13:34:14] <jl2753> Hm, is there a way to make sure an Ajax call has been stopped after success? It seems that my ajax calls are piling up one on top of another until my browser lags out
[13:34:25] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell nope.
[13:34:47] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 wut.  success means it returned successfully, doesn't it?
[13:34:48] <BillCriswell> Started slow but it got awesome.
[13:35:00] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell isn't that a mike judge show?
[13:35:33] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:35:58] <jl2753> duch_kazatel yeah it should be right? But I sent an alert after ajax success and if I click on elements that are to be ajaxed, i get the alert multiple times in a row and it get slower the more elements I click
[13:36:26] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 paste up your code?
[13:36:58] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're accidentally binding multiple times.
[13:37:08] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what's the basic premise?
[13:39:16] <Forbidd3n> When creating a parallax design it is best to design the whole site in html and then add in the parallax concepts after?

[13:57:49] <duch_kazatel> because that's almost 700 lines..
[13:58:14] <jl2753> duch_kazatel yeah let me simply if
[13:58:22] <lando23> is there a jquery.Event constructor that takes more parameters?
[13:58:25] <duch_kazatel> a basic example would be nice.
[13:59:05] <lando23> i don't see any docs on Event at http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[13:59:08] <decx> look at the answer below the linked answer
[13:59:33] <lando23> oh thanks decx
[13:59:37] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:02:40] <jl2753> duch_kazatel: okay, this should be better. http://dpaste.com/1SXWXYA/  Basically when in priceFilter() when 'enter' is pressed, I call doAjaxCall which switches out the right content. It's fine for the first 4-5 times but the more doAjaxCalls I make, the more it lags
[14:02:42] <RecoJohnson> How can I check if a json property exists for example object.error = "No Error". I tried if(object.error) but that didnt work.
[14:03:46] <r3v3rb> okay so my .php file returns a json object : {"foo":"offline"} yet the jquery .get returns JSON.parse unexpected end of data error any ideas?
[14:04:40] <RecoJohnson> r3v3rb: I had that same issue a minute ago, i would make sure all of my brackets are there in the jQuery not the php.
[14:04:59] <jsharpminor> Apparently I don't understand scope. I have a simple program here http://jsfiddle.net/W77t3/ that works, but how does the function manage to modify a variable declared outside of it?
[14:05:02] <r3v3rb> RecoJohnson: okay thanks
[14:05:05] <DeltaHeavy> r3v3rb: Can you post the raw response? You can view it under the network tab of your dev tools.
[14:05:12] <Jattenalle> r3v3rb, also jQuery follows the spec to the letter, so no whitespaces allowed
[14:05:26] <jsharpminor> The only thing worse than having code that doesn't work and you don't know why is having code that *does* work and you don't know why.
[14:05:46] <BillCriswell> RecoJohnson: That's how you'd do it. Unless object didn't exist.
[14:06:09] <Jattenalle> jsharpminor, that's called "That's a wrap! Gold, ship it!"
[14:06:44] <RecoJohnson> BillCriswell: How could I get the opposite? I want to check if it doesn't exist. Do I just use a *!*
[14:06:54] <jsharpminor> Jattenalle: lol
[14:07:11] <r3v3rb> DeltaHeavy: raw response is Reload the page to get source for: http:// lol
[14:07:26] <DeltaHeavy> r3v3rb: Hm? I mean the response from the AJAX.
[14:07:34] <lando23> jsharpminor: this is not a jquery problem, but a javascript one. here's a fiddle that demonstrates what's going on more simply http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/W77t3/1/
[14:08:05] <lando23> in that example increment() is closing over foo, and able to modify it.
[14:08:46] <lando23> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work
[14:08:50] <BillCriswell> RecoJohnson: Yes.
[14:09:09] <r3v3rb> DeltaHeavy: arggggghhhhhhhhhh
[14:09:14] <r3v3rb> I am so stupid
[14:09:27] <DeltaHeavy> r3v3rb: ?
[14:09:45] <r3v3rb> was using a virtualhost to view and the site was sending from localhost so got a cORS error from myself :D
[14:10:57] <RecoJohnson> lando23: I think you are confusing an anonymous function which is more like an object in javascript.
[14:11:09] <DeltaHeavy> r3v3rb: lol nice
[14:11:17] <jsharpminor> lando23: Thanks, I'm looking at Javascript Closures for Dummies, linked from the stackoverflow link
[14:11:24] <r3v3rb> DeltaHeavy: almost funny at 22:11 hours :)
[14:13:54] <jl2753> duch_kazatel: I've been going over this again and again but I don't see why it would keep the previous ajax call. I know that priceFilter() calls doAjaxcall() which calls ajaxCallSuccessLoad() and loads priceFilter() again but doAjaxcall() doesn't call again unless I press enter on keyboard
[14:14:09] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 sorry been stepping away a bunch
[14:14:52] <jl2753> duch_kazatel: don't even worry about it- really appreciate you helping already. been stuck on this for hours
[14:15:54] <lando23> RecoJohnson: what do you mean? what does the anonymity of the function have to do with how it closes over it's variables?
[14:15:56] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 yeah, you're binding things over and over.
[14:16:09] <duch_kazatel> function priceFilter() <-- this is part of your problem.
[14:16:16] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell my promo just went through today
[14:16:33] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:17:48] <RecoJohnson> lando23: Im not sure I know what I am talking about ignore me, but here is what I think I know lol. https://gist.github.com/btiessen/3c8e20eafc55de5f4146
[14:20:31] <duch_kazatel> back
[14:20:41] <lando23> RecoJohnson: yes, i think you're confused about closures. that code doesn't really make sense. heck the second function never fires.
[14:20:55] <lando23> you should probably put it in a fiddle and play with it
[14:20:55] <jl2753> duch_kazatel: oh, I thought I had to call it again for keypress to be recognized like the .on("clicks")
[14:21:09] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 you only need to bind it once.
[14:21:15] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 are you replacing that container?
[14:21:19] <jl2753> duch_kataztel: yeah
[14:21:23] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Heck yes.
[14:21:51] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 you should look at doing a single binding and using delegation, instead of rebinding a whole bunch.
[14:22:02] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah... i'm still mentally processing it.  way above what I was expecting.
[14:22:07] <RecoJohnson> lando23: Well if you need help with PHP i can help you there :D lmao
[14:22:51] <lando23> it's all good bro i'm a a java guy on the server side - although node is interesting too.
[14:24:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Bad ass.
[14:24:15] <BillCriswell> Congrats.
[14:24:18] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[14:25:01] <jl2753> duch_kazatel: awesome. it works- thanks so much. I'll definitely look into delegation
[14:25:27] <duch_kazatel> jl2753 yeah, .on() is your best friend in cases like this.
[14:27:04] <Sal> is there a way to write on chrome console?
[14:27:15] <BillCriswell> Sal: console.log('Stuff')
[14:27:28] <BillCriswell> And I did my duty for the day.
[14:27:30] <Sal> i tried that, but it doesn't show anything
[14:27:58] <BillCriswell> Sal: Make sure you're not filtering them out.
[14:28:28] <BillCriswell> Click the little funnel thing and make sure "All" is active.
[14:28:33] <BillCriswell> I have to run. Night everyone.
[14:28:55] <damiano> hello
[14:29:03] <damiano> whats wrong with: $(document).on('load','.dx', function() { }
[14:29:11] <damiano> i do not get this event!
[14:29:43] <Sal> filter seems off , the icon is grey and not blue
[14:29:55] <Sal> anyway, if i enable it, i have it set to ALL
[14:30:13] <damiano> i need to get the event when the element is completly created
[14:33:24] <Sal> damiano, why don't you do:  $('.dx').on('load', function() { }
[14:34:46] <damiano> Sal, also tried... it is not fired
[14:34:51] <damiano> i do not understand the reason!
[14:35:46] <Sal> maybe you got something wrong with the class
[14:36:02] <Sal> if you want to reference a single element, you should use an id
[14:36:23] <damiano> the problem is that i also tried 'load' on #wrapper
[14:36:29] <damiano> i only have one #wrapper
[14:37:22] <damiano> $('#wrapper').on('load', function() {  alert('hello'); });
[14:37:29] <damiano> i do not see any alert Sal
[14:37:38] <lando23> okay this is amusing. i know what the problem is, but i figured i'd share. i wanted to write a little replay function for the green square, but it doesn't work. http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/3KXuL/17/
[14:38:54] <Sal> damiano , using ie?
[14:39:11] <damiano> chrome
[14:39:32] <damiano> Sal,  Versione 34.0.1847.116 Ubuntu 14.04 aura (260972)
[14:39:55] <lando23> $.tirgger is pushing the event back onto the array, and then popping it off again. fixed. http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/3KXuL/18/
[14:40:16] <Sal> damiano, did you try cleaning cache?
[14:40:40] <damiano> Sal i was thinking about that
[14:40:45] <damiano> i try to remove everything
[14:41:08] <Sal> make a new page with just that event and an alert
[14:42:48] <damiano> Sal, nothing happen
[14:42:53] <damiano> i also tried with Firefox
[14:43:09] <Sal> did you try the short version of load?
[14:43:36] <Sal>  $('.dx').load(function() { });
[14:44:33] <damiano> i try
[14:46:22] <damiano> Sal same thing!
[14:46:25] <damiano> -_-
[14:46:49] <damiano> Sal i am using (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js)
[14:47:37] <meisth0th> hello
[14:47:57] <meisth0th> i am looking a jquery plugin that can replace the webrotate360 (http://www.webrotate360.com/), do you know anything like that?
[14:49:20] <Sal> damiano, i din't ask before, but i hope you're using the load event on elements loaded with an url
[14:49:49] <damiano> Sal no are not ajax calls .... elements inside the page
[14:49:51] <Sal> like images, frames, scripts
[14:49:52] <loincloth> hi all
[14:49:59] <damiano> Sal no
[14:50:05] <Sal> elements do not generate load events
[14:50:12] <Sal> thats why
[14:50:19] <Sal> use the ready event instead
[14:50:27] <damiano> as i told you i did it on #wrapper
[14:50:28] <damiano> aah ok
[14:50:29] <damiano> i try
[14:50:30] <Sal> $('.dx').ready(function() { alert('ok'); });
[14:50:36] <loincloth> i am having trouble triggering click on an svg path element... are there any gotchas here? i'm confused because i attach the event in an intuitive way and it responds to click in the browser... but then getting a similar element in my unit tests and triggering click on it isn't working
[14:50:49] <Sal> load works ony on elements with url parameter
[14:50:59] <loincloth> we are using Raphael to generate some maps and i want to test analytics added to click handlers on the various shapes
[14:51:08] <damiano> Sal ook it works correctly
[14:51:13] <damiano> Sal one doubt
[14:51:29] <damiano> why $('#wrapper').on('ready', function() { } no works?
[14:51:33] <damiano> .ready() yes
[14:51:37] <damiano> .on('ready') no
[14:52:04] <duch_kazatel> isn't .read() just .on('ready') under the hood?
[14:52:06] <Sal> i only use the on() with the click event of the <button> element
[14:52:13] <damiano> ah ok
[14:52:15] <Sal> with everything else, i use the short way
[14:52:17] <duch_kazatel> *ready
[14:52:48] <damiano> ok
[15:02:51] <nym> hey #jquery - i have a slightly off topic question, but i'm looking for non-expert answers and #jquery is a good place for smart folks
[15:03:24] <nym> Q: What's preventing you from using bitcoin personally or for your company?
[15:26:55] <il> is there a jquery.dataTables channel?
[15:28:16] <artgoeshere> I'm making an ajax POST request then using .done and .fail to handle the response. How does it know to do the .fail ? Does it look at the response code?
[15:28:25] <DeltaHeavy> il: Probably not but this channel will surely be able to help you. It's not too busy at the moment though.
[15:29:39] <shoky> artgoeshere: yes
[15:31:13] <artgoeshere> shoky, so anything that's outside of 2xx will hit the fail?
[15:32:00] <artgoeshere> Or actually 3xx is probably not a fail as well
[15:33:19] <artgoeshere> Ah, nevermind, found it in the source :D
[15:33:20] <artgoeshere> isSuccess = status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304;
[15:33:42] <qle> hi
[15:36:07] <shoky> artgoeshere: also things like if the response is invalid json could trigger it
[15:45:57] <artgoeshere> shoky, makes sense
[15:58:45] <acidjazz> what are those pics called of the person partying but all in the same room and its just a bunch of shots of that same person
[16:01:56] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[16:04:25] <artgoeshere> acidjazz, Photoshopped
[16:05:01] <acidjazz> i need a little more detail artgoeshere
[16:05:03] <acidjazz> something googleable
[16:05:11] <artgoeshere> ;)
[16:05:12] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz not even sure what you're looking for.
[16:05:47] <tw2113> not sure i want to know myself
[16:05:57] <artgoeshere> Are you just looking for examples or do you want to know how to make them?
[16:06:07] <acidjazz> i need to know theyre name
[16:06:10] <acidjazz> the person sets up a tripod
[16:06:12] <acidjazz> in their family room
[16:06:12] <artgoeshere> multiplicity photography?
[16:06:27] <acidjazz> yes artgoeshere
[16:06:29] <acidjazz> howd you find that
[16:06:44] * artgoeshere slowly sneaks out of the channel
[16:07:00] <duch_kazatel> whosawhat
[16:07:17] <duch_kazatel> how did you even figure out what he meant?!
[16:07:18] <artgoeshere> also I went to art school
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> <@nexxy> acidjazz, composite loneliness?
[16:07:40] <duch_kazatel> over in #Node.js - better answer.
[16:09:12] <artgoeshere> I believe what acidjazz is doing is called a "multiplicity query" ;)
[16:22:16] <acidjazz> artgoeshere: tyty
[16:23:35] <artgoeshere> npnp
[16:53:32] <xsamurai> how do i assign on change events to a forms select $(document.body).on('change", "input[name*='test']:select", function () { alert });
[16:54:45] <xsamurai> also is it possible to do a parent relationship so I specify the form > "input[name*='select]" for the change event
[16:56:13] <__joshua__> you probably don't wont to listen to body
[16:56:18] <__joshua__> typically you would delegate the form
[16:56:36] <xsamurai> I did but delegate is not supported in the newer jquery
[16:56:41] <xsamurai> it was working fine with it
[16:56:48] <xsamurai> in the older version
[16:56:51] <__joshua__> $(form).on('change', 'select[name*=test]', function(){
[16:57:27] <xsamurai> but if the data is dynamic and it gets added later on , that doesnt work
[16:58:36] <__joshua__> if the form is added later, yes
[16:58:45] <__joshua__> if the select is added later, no problem
[16:59:58] <__joshua__> And I promise you delegates are working.  they just use the .on() function
[17:00:26] <xsamurai> so can I go back to using delegate instead ?
[17:00:35] <__joshua__>  $(form).on('change', 'select[name*=test]', function(){ is a delegate
[17:01:20] <xsamurai> if i dynamically add sub selects after that select , it doesnt work
[17:01:26] <xsamurai> unless I use document.body
[17:01:37] <xsamurai> maybe my syntax was off let me retry it
[17:05:25] <xsamurai> __joshua__: thanks for the help
[17:05:36] <xsamurai> __joshua__: worked fine with form name as well
[17:05:42] <__joshua__> cool
[17:17:41] <triplef> hey all good evening
[17:18:39] <duch_kazatel> sup
[17:19:04] <triplef> i have a multiple input boxes.. id="payout_1_12346564" id="payout_2_aisdjaoij03 etc etc ... im trying to match my index+1 $( "input[id*='payout_']"+index+1).val('somthing');
[17:19:11] <triplef> but not workign / any ideas ?
[17:19:42] <triplef> meaning if index =2 i want to match input with id="payout_3_something
[17:21:47] <duch_kazatel>  $( "input[id*='payout_"+index+1"']") or somesuch
[17:22:05] <duch_kazatel> thought that's going to be sloooow.
[17:22:22] <duch_kazatel> s/thought/thoguh
[17:22:27] <duch_kazatel> ugh
[17:25:34] <triplef> var index2=index+1;
[17:25:39] <triplef> $( "input[id*='payout_'+index2]").val(index);
[17:25:42] <triplef> doesnt work
[17:26:47] <triplef> $( "input[id*='payout_"+index2+"']").val(index);
[17:26:49] <triplef> this worked
[17:29:58] <triplef> thakns a mill
[17:30:03] <triplef> next step im stuck too
[17:30:04] <triplef> var avalue = $( "input[id*='usde_client_perc"+index2+"']").val
[17:30:04] <triplef> $( "input[id*='usde_payout_"+index2+"']").val(avalue);
[17:30:14] <triplef> trying to get the oh my bad
[17:30:29] <triplef> var avalue = $( "input[id*='usde_client_perc"+index2+"']").val

[17:30:32] <triplef> oups
[17:30:55] <triplef> <span id="usde_client_perc_1">59.013866309761</span>
[17:31:08] <triplef> sop basicallyu i want to grab this value in avalue
[17:31:19] <duch_kazatel> that's not .val() - .val() is for inputs.
[17:31:21] <duch_kazatel> you want .text()
[17:31:26] <triplef> var avalue = $( "span[id*='usde_client_perc"+index2+"']").text()
[17:33:59] <triplef> to i need to int it ?
[17:34:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:34:07] <triplef> var avalue = $( "span[id*='usde_client_perc_"+index2+"']").text()*$('#usde_dist').text();
[17:34:19] <triplef> i need to multiply with another and then divide all by 100
[17:34:20] <duch_kazatel> .text() is getting the text...
[17:34:30] <triplef> yeah is there a ToINT() ?
[17:34:42] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn parsefloat

[17:47:50] <duch_kazatel> triplef you use .val() in inputs.
[17:50:42] <triplef> yeah got it thanks
[17:51:45] <triplef> thanks a mill
[17:51:49] <triplef> bleeding eyes on this
[17:51:50] <duch_kazatel> yep
[17:55:36] <triplef> duch a last one before i crash
[17:55:41] <triplef> still ahve that fiddle ?
[17:56:22] <triplef> http://jsfiddle.net/rdUZ3/
[17:56:43] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[17:57:25] <triplef> do you know if its possible to do this ? build an array of words like {foo,bar,blah,usde} and whereever the fiddle has those words use them ? meaning loop trought our little function but for all
[17:57:35] <triplef> i dont want to copy/ paste this 1000 times for all of them
[17:58:07] <triplef> if array contains " apple , usde " then my function would   $('#calc_WORDFROMARRAY').click(function() {
[17:58:17] <triplef> or a loop from array ?
[17:58:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:58:52] <triplef> the word is in patern matchinf only maybe a hack of this.something
[17:59:02] <duch_kazatel> what are you actually trying to do?
[17:59:08] <triplef> ok lets say i want to repeat this whole function 10 times
[17:59:29] <triplef> one for #calc_usde one for #calc_blue onr for calc_mint
[17:59:38] <triplef> only where you see usde that would change
[17:59:46] <triplef> from array i would build and make it loop
[17:59:48] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're not abstracting well.
[17:59:52] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[18:00:04] <triplef> im a jquery dumb and dumber
[18:00:33] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('click', '#calc_usde', function(){});
[18:00:59] <duch_kazatel> where parent is a parent element of all these things, and #calc_usde could be a comma separated string of all the things you want to bind do.
[18:01:01] <duch_kazatel> *do
[18:02:20] <duch_kazatel> bye
[18:02:29] <triplef> no i mean... in php its $foo=array('blue','brown','mice'); and then i would of looped foreach ($foo as $item) { $('#calc_{$item}').click(function() { etc etc
[18:06:05] <DeltaHeavy> triplef: That hurt my brain =/
[18:45:05] <Foxhoundz> silence
[18:47:35] <nacsurte> i'm trying to clone a div and append it to an element on click, http://jsfiddle.net/2p2K2/
[18:47:40] <nacsurte> but doesn't seem to work
[18:55:40] <triplef> DeltaHeavy lol
[18:55:44] <triplef> my eyes sore
[18:56:03] <triplef> im mnot javascript i HATE nodejs coz i dont get it but i would kill to learn it
[20:05:05] <il> could someone help me out with my questions on stackoverflow? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23643382/how-can-i-make-text-white-for-all-text-after-a-certain-text-length-has-been-reac
[20:05:10] <il> question*
[21:41:58] <__joshua__> il: you can define render function for  column
[21:42:21] <__joshua__> look up mRender
[21:53:06] <slu9freek> If I do a foo = getElementById, can I call jQuery methods on foo or do I need to $(foo)?
[23:11:55] <optifree> I'm trying to understand how event delegation works with a case statement- is this wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/sFJc9/
[23:30:08] <slu9freek> I'm still getting used to jQuery, if i script = createElement, is $(script).insertBefore($('[src="js/main.js"]')[0]); legal syntax for inserting it before another script?
[23:41:11] <Cork> slu9freek: you don't really have "insert before"
[23:41:12] <joshuaw> slu9freek: are you trying to insert a script within a script?
[23:41:29] <Cork> slu9freek: when js is executing you can only dynamically load scripts
[23:41:30] <slu9freek> joshuaw: yes
[23:41:42] <Cork> so there is no before
[23:41:43] <joshuaw> you need to use something like AMD
[23:41:52] <slu9freek> joshuaw: not sure what that is
[23:42:04] <joshuaw> otherwise it is not possible
[23:42:08] <joshuaw> let me get a link
[23:42:34] <joshuaw> slu9freek: http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html
[23:42:55] <joshuaw> it allows you to create a Modular design in javascript
[23:42:59] <Cork> joshuaw: that isn't true
[23:43:04] <slu9freek> bugger..
[23:43:09] <joshuaw> no?
[23:43:10] <Cork> you can load scripts without module separation
[23:43:24] <joshuaw> only in the html
[23:43:29] <Cork> no
[23:43:46] <joshuaw> ?
[23:44:03] <joshuaw> that is what I know
[23:44:13] <joshuaw> I'm open to learning something new
[23:44:17] <Cork> var newScript = document.createElement('script'); newScript.onload = function() { /* your dependent code runs here */ }; newScript.src = url; document.head.appendChild(newScript);
[23:45:35] <joshuaw> I am not sure but that looks like you are creating html to load the script into
[23:45:54] <joshuaw> though it would be a sort of 'orphan' html
[23:45:59] <joshuaw> very interesting idea
[23:46:01] <Cork> joshuaw: that is basically what requireJS does behind the seen
[23:46:10] <joshuaw> cool
[23:46:22] <Cork> if you want to clean up after your self you just do
[23:46:30] <Cork> document.head.removeChild(newScript);
[23:46:38] <Cork> directly after appendChild
[23:46:59] <Cork> joshuaw: there is one other option you can do and that is ajax pull the script as text
[23:47:01] <Cork> and then eval it
[23:47:06] <Cork> but that only works on the same domain
[23:47:23] <Cork> so most scripts do it the way i showed up there
[23:47:50] <joshuaw> I've done it 2 ways
[23:47:56] <Cork> (jquery getScript checks if the request is for the same domain and use eval then, else falls back to the script element)
[23:48:01] <joshuaw> require.js and using the Module pattern
[23:49:15] <joshuaw> slu9freek: well I hope that helped
[23:49:37] <joshuaw> slu9freek: you should know more now then when you asked ;)
[23:49:41] <Cork> joshuaw: well those are just sugar, the system can only do it two ways
[23:50:06] <Cork> and system == web
[23:51:01] <slu9freek> joshuaw: haha, well I am doing what Cork said, but the jQuery method is more interesting. at this point, i'm not sure it's a good idea to use either?
[23:51:38] <joshuaw> slu9freek: have you heard of the Module Pattern in JS?
[23:51:41] <Cork> slu9freek: it depends on what your doing
[23:51:50] <slu9freek> joshuaw: no
[23:52:01] <Cork> slu9freek: if your building a widget, then no it's a bad idea
[23:52:44] <Cork> if you're trying to speed up your side, then you're prob better served compressing the scripts into one minified file
[23:52:52] <slu9freek> Cork: I'm working on a visualizer (completely client-side app) that has a folder of visualizations that I'd like to be included automatically in one of my scripts
[23:52:52] <Cork> side==site
[23:53:28] <Cork> slu9freek: well if you want to offer the script to other sites to use, then i would say it is a bad idea
[23:53:36] <Cork> slu9freek: define jquery as a dependency
[23:53:49] <Cork> and let the site be the one controlling how jquery needs to be included
[23:53:52] <slu9freek> Cork: not sure what you mean, but jQuery is def a dependency atm
[23:54:17] <Cork> slu9freek: its a bad idea to bundle dependencies
[23:54:35] <slu9freek> Cork: you mean include them in my app? why's that?
[23:54:36] <Cork> that is the main source of pain for adding a widget in my experience
[23:55:12] <Cork> slu9freek: what i mean is you should just define jquery (possibly version) as a dependency
[23:55:24] <Cork> so the site can control if it needs it and if so how
[23:55:41] <joshuaw> slu9freek: I answered a related question on StackOverflow a while back, it has more details then I could easily provide here.
[23:55:45] <joshuaw> slu9freek: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20311604/module-pattern-how-to-split-the-code-for-one-module-into-different-js-files/20359283#20359283
[23:55:45] <slu9freek> Cork: I'm not really sure how to do that (beyond documenting it)
[23:55:57] <Cork> cause else you have an extremely high likelihood of causing compatibility problems in the site
[23:56:06] <Cork> slu9freek: that is all you do
[23:56:20] <Cork> slu9freek: let the site developer handle including it
[23:56:23] <Cork> just assume it is there
[23:56:48] <slu9freek> Cork: either way, that doesn't affect the inclusion of my visualization libs
[23:57:04] <mikunos> good morning guys
[23:57:04] <Cork> slu9freek: it does kinda
[23:57:13] <slu9freek> Cork: howso?
[23:57:43] <Cork> slu9freek: as i've said several times now...
[23:57:51] <Cork> "don't load dependencies from your lib"
[23:57:57] <Cork> "depend on them being there"
[23:58:20] <Cork> that is what causes least problems for the site administrator
[23:58:27] <slu9freek> Cork: I see, but they are libs I wrote and would ship with the lib that I'm including them from
[23:58:31] <Cork> cause then they can up front see what needs to be there
[23:58:41] <Cork> and they get a clear "function not found" error
[23:59:02] <Cork> contra to murky conflicts from libs depending on there own version of jquery and conflicts from overwriting
[23:59:14] <Cork> and plugins getting added to the wrong instance of jquery and..
[23:59:15] <Cork> UGG
[23:59:48] <Cork> slu9freek: that is exactly the concept i'm trying to tell you NOT to do...
