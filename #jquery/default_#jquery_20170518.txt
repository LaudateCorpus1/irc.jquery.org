[05:47:30] <rominronin> Hello, has anyone used this before: http://casperin.github.io/nod/
[05:47:47] <rominronin> I'd love to hear your collective thoughts on it!
[05:47:57] <rominronin> before I go adding it to my project!
[05:55:06] <Ange7> Hey all
[05:55:18] <Ange7> Someone can help me with collapse feature ?
[06:03:28] <Ange7> https://jsfiddle.net/wtgdwsbh/ : Someone know how to make collapse on "title" & "subTitle" : If title is open at left, right need to be open too, (same for subTitle)
[06:31:15] <elhut> Hello. Anyone knows of is possible to position a div in a left of the screen?. This div is inside of <li> element, but I want to move it from there
[07:36:21] <mazert> hello, people are using fullcalendar here ? I try to keep holding an event with mouse during a drag and drop process, while an autorefresh ressource preocess is running in the background.
[07:38:05] <Cork> mazert: background process?
[07:38:12] <Cork> are you sure your asking in the correct channel?
[07:39:00] <mazert> Cork: fullcalendar is a jquery plugin, and there is no official channel for it
[07:39:12] <Cork> mazert: ya, but js doesn't have background processes
[07:39:21] <Cork> unless your talking about webworkers
[07:39:29] <mazert> Cork: yes, a script that refresh the calendar's data every 5 secs
[07:39:45] <Cork> that isn't a process :)
[07:39:48] <Cork> thats a timer
[07:40:11] <mazert> yes i didn't used the good words sorry :)
[07:40:29] <Cork> ok, if the updating of the calendar is replacing the html in the widget you can't get around things breaking
[07:40:43] <Cork> only option would be to disable the timer when dragging starts
[07:41:03] <Cork> so what you need to do depends on if you can get the update system to not depend on replacing the content
[07:43:39] <mazert> yes it was my first idea, i have to predict each case the user have to use the calendar items, to pause the refresh timer.
[07:44:13] <Cork> well, no not really
[07:44:44] <Cork> you just have to set a global variable when $(document).on('mousedown') and reset it on $(document).on('mouseup')
[07:44:54] <Cork> and if the variable is true don't do anything in the timer
[07:46:09] <mazert> Cork: ah yes, your solution is fine :)
[07:47:04] <mazert> ok, I will do this, thanks you
[08:57:30] <cxeq> hi, is Pigueiras solution still the best way to do this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16266701/processing-twitter-bootstrap-events-with-flask
[08:58:03] <cxeq> (I don't think this question is too far on the Flask side but let me know if I am in the wrong place)
[08:58:44] <cxeq> using hidden inputs and all seems weird but I am a noob when it comes to ajax n all html dev
[09:17:59] <rjCousineau> Hi. I have an usual situation where I have pending xhr requests, and they are loading 'in-order' it seems.  but my latest one I want to load before other pending xhr requests.. I'm not sure if it's the actual server's thread that is making the request respond in order or the javascript
[09:23:38] <nikio_> how can i make a div slide in from the top
[09:23:46] <nikio_> like a bootstrap modal
[09:25:09] <rjCousineau> nikio_: $('div').slideDown('fast');
[09:25:22] <nikio_> that messes with the height doesnt it?
[09:25:32] <rjCousineau> not sure
[09:25:36] <nikio_> yup it does
[09:25:43] <nikio_> it looks messed up
[09:25:48] <nikio_> not like boostrap modal
[09:26:19] <rjCousineau> $('div').animate({ top: '+200px' })
[09:35:50] <nikio_> thx rjCousineau hope that stuff works
[09:35:54] <nikio_> on most browsers
[09:53:23] <Justice_W> anyone used moment library? how can the output of moment((new Date('2017-05-18T15:45:00') - new Date('2017-05-18T15:44:00'))).format('HH:mm:ss'); give "01:01:00" ? should it not be 00:01:00 ?
[09:58:37] <Cork> Justice_W: are you sure moment can take one date object minus the other?
[10:01:19] <Cork> Justice_W: ya it is suppose to be moment(date1).diff(moment(date2))
[10:03:50] <Cork> Justice_W: also it seams moment doesn't handle negative values well
[10:04:18] <Justice_W> yeah
[10:05:47] <Justice_W> and you cannot format diff ;(
[10:07:37] <Justice_W> Cork: and it gives the same result as the original I posted
[10:07:54] <Justice_W> well if you add the result of that to a moment object and format it
[10:09:55] <Cork> Justice_W: moment.utc(moment('2017-05-18T15:45:00').diff(moment('2017-05-18T15:44:00'))).format('HH:mm:ss')
[10:10:19] <Cork> had to dig a round quite a bit in the documentation to figure out how to format the ms value correctly >_>
[10:11:18] <Cork> that meaning moment.utc((new Date('2017-05-18T15:45:00') - new Date('2017-05-18T15:44:00'))).format('HH:mm:ss') works too
[10:12:30] <Justice_W> Cork: why does that work ?
[10:12:58] <Cork> Justice_W: when you give moment() a number it assumes it is meant to be read in the current timezone
[10:13:08] <Cork> so it adds your timeoffset to the number
[10:13:15] <Cork> and that is why you get the extra hour
[10:13:26] <Cork> moment.utc doesn't and that is why it works
[10:14:59] <Justice_W> hm
[10:53:11] <nikio_> how to make sure that a div goes below the view port and disapears when using:  $('#session_container').animate({ top: '1000px' }) ?
[10:55:17] <pavonia> Does top: "100vh" work?
[10:59:00] <nikio_> paviona maybe .. is it supported widely these days?
[11:02:29] <taplar> http://caniuse.com/#search=vw
[11:29:23] <Es0teric> what is DOMSubtreeModified supposed to do?
[11:29:59] <taplar> sounds like a js thing
[11:34:12] <Es0teric> taplar you dont say?
[11:35:53] <snover> Es0teric: eventually it is supposed to do nothing. it is a deprecated API.
[11:36:11] <Es0teric> snover so then what replaces it?
[11:36:21] <snover> MutationObserver
[11:37:12] <taplar> my statement wasn't meant to be snarky.  more that the question is more ##javascript related than #jquery
[11:37:49] <Es0teric> ah ok
[12:44:47] <rjCousineau> Hi. I have a kiosk thats interactive.. but it's all in one page-load.  I'm worried of it crashing by not having any browser refresh,, I could do a refresh but I dont know if its necessary
[12:47:59] <taplar> what's the concern?
[12:48:39] <rjCousineau> memory leak
[12:48:51] <rjCousineau> the kiosk will run indefinately
[12:49:02] <taplar> if you are scoping your js properly you shouldn't get leaks really
[12:49:29] <rjCousineau> I hope so
[12:49:35] <taplar> are you seeing a leak?
[12:49:49] <rjCousineau> I just deployed it, i just dont want it to crash while i'm not available
[12:50:32] <taplar> do you have any sort of functional tests that run against it?
[12:50:48] <rjCousineau> Theres 6 kiosks running.. not a big deal, just wondering if doing a refresh fixes memory leaks
[12:51:14] <taplar> a refresh would cause the browser to release the resources it has got during that page load before it rebuilds, yeah
[12:51:27] <taplar> but it sounds like you are pre-emptively trying to fix an issue that may not exist
[12:51:55] <rjCousineau> true
[12:52:50] <taplar> instead i would suggesting finding a programmatic way of applying a continuous load on the app (such as with functional tests) and see if the memory increases over time as it should not do.
[12:53:02] <taplar> to see if there is indeed a leak
[12:53:42] <rjCousineau> great idea. I did not think of performing a synthetic stress teest
[13:08:42] <darkdrgn2k> hi all

[13:24:40] <Duikb00t-home> Hi
[13:24:51] <hlve> Hallo
[13:26:01] <Duikb00t-home> I have an issue but's its hard to reproduce in a fiddle but I am going to try.
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:28:22] <Es0teric> is there any way to check for a xhr request being processed on a page?
[13:29:03] <hlve> Es0teric, use ajaxStart, and ajaxStop to keep track of when requests are active.
[13:29:11] <Duikb00t-home> Ok it's pretty easy actually but you have to follow a little th einstructions
[13:29:16] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/13cjvwvz/1/
[13:29:25] <Duikb00t-home> Line 1 is a click which referes to an Anchor #anchor-gites
[13:29:29] <hlve> And apparently, you can use $.active to return the number of active ajax requests.
[13:29:31] <hlve> Interesting
[13:29:52] <Duikb00t-home> As you can see in the html on line 8
[13:29:56] <Duikb00t-home> the anchor is set.
[13:30:03] <Duikb00t-home> Now I want to check the input type next to it
[13:30:26] <Duikb00t-home> As you see in the JS on line 18 i am trying to get there... but it's not easy :(
[13:30:29] <hlve> Es0teric, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3148225/jquery-active-function
[13:30:48] <hlve> Duikb00t-home, sec
[13:31:31] <Es0teric> hlve so then i just can check for jQuery.ajax.active ?
[13:31:55] <hlve> apparently it's just $.active
[13:32:11] <hlve> no need for ajax.active.
[13:32:29] <taplar_lunch> closest() searches through parent elements
[13:33:18] <Duikb00t-home> oh i need 'sibling' > 'child' or something
[13:34:51] <Es0teric> hlve if i want to trigger a function every time an ajax call occurs
[13:34:59] <Es0teric> would it be if( $.active == 1 ) ?
[13:35:05] <taplar_lunch> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[13:36:07] <hlve> Es0teric, for that, you'd probably just use ajaxStart.
[13:36:11] <hlve> https://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[13:37:30] <Duikb00t-home> hmmhh
[13:43:43] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric why not just make a convenience method that calls whatever you need before you run $.ajax?
[13:44:27] <hlve> Why not just use ajaxStart?
[13:44:28] <hlve> o_o
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> magic and woo.  by the time the next person comes along trying to figure out why something is running it's harder to track that down than to just trace through the functions.
[13:45:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees because this project's js is too crazy
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:47:40] <tyoc213> is possible to submit a form ajax get? (I mean not post?)
[13:51:57] <taplar_lunch> yes, ajax supports all the normal http methods
[13:52:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:57:58] <Duikb00t-home> meh wtf can't get my result ( that input field here : https://jsfiddle.net/13cjvwvz/1/  )
[13:58:05] <Duikb00t-home> Not my day today ><
[13:59:04] <cannap> sure
[13:59:07] <cannap> first add jquery
[13:59:26] <Duikb00t-home> oh example is not working there but it's easy really
[13:59:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:59:45] <robertmaxrees> if it's so easy then why are you getting tripped up? ;)
[14:00:13] <taplar_lunch> express in words the relation of the element you want in relation to the element you have
[14:00:35] <Es0teric> this is getting frustrating
[14:00:35] <Duikb00t-home> OK perfect
[14:00:39] <Es0teric> ajaxStart() is not working
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you defining it before the ajax call runs?
[14:01:08] <Duikb00t-home> 1) When I click line 1 (in the html) I go to line 8 (the anchor in the html).
[14:01:14] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no
[14:01:23] <Duikb00t-home> With jquery I am then on that anchor level. ...
[14:01:25] <Es0teric> idk where in the chain the ajax call happens
[14:01:32] <Duikb00t-home> but I want to select the input type to add it as checked.
[14:01:41] <tyoc213> is possible to send a form in get on a page, but not reload the view?
[14:01:44] <taplar> how is the input related to the anchor in the dom?
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> tyoc213 yep.
[14:01:52] <Duikb00t-home> So in more easy words: select from line 8 line 10
[14:01:54] <robertmaxrees> tyoc213 that's ajax.
[14:02:01] <Duikb00t-home> it's always in that order in the dom.
[14:02:11] <taplar> that's not expressing the relationship in words
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric then you're SOL - gotta define the handler before you fire the call.
[14:02:27] <taplar> are they siblings?  is one the child of the other?  is one a child of a sibling? etc...
[14:03:03] <taplar> the dom is a tree.  you have to figure out the relationship in regards to the tree
[14:04:14] <Es0teric> shit
[14:04:36] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric why are you trying to catch all ajax calls before they fire?
[14:05:03] <tyoc213> robertmaxrees, and without ajax/js is not possible I guess
[14:05:03] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees not all just one
[14:05:18] <tyoc213> I mean a form post/get/put/some else will reload the page
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> tyoc213 pretty much.
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> tyoc213 yep.
[14:05:38] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you just don't know where that ajax call is getting fired from?
[14:05:42] <Duikb00t-home> taplar:  yes i get that but it's just this:
[14:05:47] <taplar> only way without ajax would be an iframe thing, which would be restricted to gets tyoc213
[14:05:55] <Es0teric> correct, robertmaxrees
[14:06:02] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/e8222kzq/
[14:06:03] <Duikb00t-home> ;p
[14:06:05] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so why not figure that part out instead?
[14:06:29] <taplar> Duikb00t-home: i don't see an anchor in there
[14:06:29] <tyoc213> taplar et robertmaxrees thanks
[14:06:43] <Duikb00t-home> no that was on top but it goes to that one you can actually forget all other dom elements.
[14:07:00] <Duikb00t-home> Going from #anchor-gites to that input is my actual question. :)
[14:07:17] <taplar> ok, so how are they related?
[14:07:29] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so i can confirm that the file i was in gets loaded before the ajax call
[14:07:33] <Es0teric> that i was talking about
[14:07:42] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric http://stackoverflow.com/a/17210212/923919
[14:07:55] <robertmaxrees> like, pretty easy to find the code that fired the call.
[14:08:00] <taplar> i'm stressing your ability to express the relationship because it is an important thing to be able to do, imho
[14:08:09] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ taplar+++++
[14:08:16] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i did find it
[14:08:20] <Es0teric> but i cant modify it
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric is it apart of a plugin?
[14:08:27] <Es0teric> i have to find a different solution
[14:08:30] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no
[14:08:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:08:53] <robertmaxrees> so you're being asked to change something without modifying the code?
[14:10:00] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees basically
[14:10:09] <Es0teric> i mean if its something that cant be helped then thats a different story
[14:10:15] <Es0teric> but i need to find an alternate way of approaching it
[14:10:28] <robertmaxrees> then you can't really do the job reliably.  you can try to use ajaxStart but that's prone to making things really confusing in the future.
[14:13:14] <Es0teric> ajaxStart is not being triggered
[14:13:18] <Es0teric> =_=
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> likely because you're biunding it after the call runs.
[14:13:41] <robertmaxrees> or you're bound to the wrong thing.
[14:13:44] <robertmaxrees> midn sharing your copde?
[14:15:07] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i just said earlier that the file i am calling ajaxStart in is being loaded before the file containing the ajax call
[14:15:30] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean the binding is happening first.  your file could be asyc'd in, or using document ready.
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just because a file loads first doesn't mean its logic runs.
[14:15:55] <robertmaxrees> *logic runs first
[14:16:49] <Es0teric> -_-
[14:17:14] <robertmaxrees> you're binding that handler to document, right?
[14:23:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no a specific div
[14:23:32] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric that's why.
[14:23:36] <robertmaxrees> it has to be global.
[14:24:19] <Es0teric> nope
[14:24:26] <Es0teric> it still doesnt trigger my console.log() at least
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/ -> under "Additional Notes:" -> As of jQuery 1.9, all the handlers for the jQuery global Ajax events, including those added with the .ajaxStart() method, must be attached to document.
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> how are you bindiong it?
[14:25:02] <robertmaxrees> also, is this a cross-domain call?
[14:25:05] <Es0teric>   $(document).ajaxStart(function() { console.log('test'); });
[14:25:09] <Es0teric> no its not
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> is ajaxSetup defined anywhere in your codebase?
[14:25:52] <robertmaxrees> if so - did they set global to false?
[14:26:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees sec
[14:29:35] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees nope
[14:30:11] <robertmaxrees> is the call do a JSONP endpoint?
[14:30:18] <Es0teric> no
[14:30:28] <Es0teric> just json
[14:30:45] <robertmaxrees> and your console isn't filtering things out?
[14:30:57] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise, i'd have to see it.
[14:31:12] <Es0teric> my console is just not outputting the test
[14:31:16] <Es0teric> that i told it to output
[14:31:22] <Es0teric> on that ajaxStart
[14:31:32] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just suggesting things at this point.
[14:53:50] <taplar> mmm, i keep downloading vms to test older ie versions, and then i get stuck in the security updates when i go to shut them down, lol. -_-
[15:03:43] <zenox> hi, i want to allow the user to select an image file with a file input, then i'd like to base64 encode it, and send it as a string to an api request - is this possible?
[15:03:59] <taplar> yep
[15:04:07] <zenox> or, am i going to have to send the file contents completely, and allow serverside code to encode to base64?
[15:04:14] <taplar> quick google will turn up some results on how to do that
[15:04:45] <zenox> all i found was using canvas
[15:04:54] <taplar> what did you search for?
[15:05:39] <zenox> ah nm, dropped down from image file to just file in my search term
[15:06:10] <taplar> "base64 encode file upload" seems reasonable
[15:32:03] <arosen> I'm  struggling to figure out how to make the removing elements part of infinite scroll smooth. WHen I remove elements from the dom the current elements shown on the screen move slightly because the height of the div changes.
[15:32:12] <arosen> any tips on how to improve/fix that?
[15:32:50] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to remove elements?
[15:33:07] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  to save memory
[15:33:26] <robertmaxrees> are you having issues with memory right now?
[15:33:29] <arosen> since the user could scroll for a very long time and then my app crashes
[15:33:38] <arosen> yea, if the user scrolls for a long time it does.
[15:34:32] <robertmaxrees> i mean, I'd personally cap the results at about 100 and then force pagination, but otherwise you'd need to get the height of each element before you remove it and then scroll the window up that amount when it's removed.
[15:38:42] <arosen> robertmaxrees: yup, i guess i need to figure out the scroll height amount to set it to remove the bounce.
[15:39:05] <robertmaxrees> the current scroll position - the height of the removed element would be a good place to start :)
[15:39:38] <Es0teric> can you use .then() on a .post() ?
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees>  what do the docs tell you?
[15:40:58] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ -> "Returns: jqXHR" -> http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jqXHR -> "For more information, see the jqXHR section of the $.ajax entry" -> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[15:41:23] <robertmaxrees> a bit of a trail but hopefully that shows you how to get those kinds of answers.
[16:02:52] <arosen>  robertmaxrees yea make it even harder to get smooth since i have gravety scrolling on. I need to detect when the user isn't scrolling anymore.
[16:04:59] <robertmaxrees> then you want a debounce.
[16:23:40] <cannap> or
[16:23:43] <cannap> a timeout
[16:23:49] <cannap> ^^
[16:25:30] <robertmaxrees> nah.  go with a debounce.
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> timeouts aren't really helpful in that case.
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> except to implement the debounce ;)
[16:26:36] <taplar> good way to get a traveling foul
[16:26:36] <cannap> yea but i dont know the whole stuff behind
[16:26:51] <cannap> when i scroll down and just stop
[16:26:53] <robertmaxrees> lol wat
[16:27:15] <cannap> i just stop
[16:27:34] <robertmaxrees> "i don't understand something so i'm going to suggest something else"
[16:27:53] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:27:55] <cannap> and i dont know what gravety is
[16:28:58] <robertmaxrees> key phrase for that was " I need
[16:28:59] <robertmaxrees> to detect when the user isn't scrolling anymore.
[16:29:20] <cannap> hm
[16:29:23] <cannap> this is new for me
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> hence the debounce suggestion ;)
[16:30:25] <cannap> i hope will do and deliver some results
[16:30:33] <cannap> he will*
[16:30:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> okay
[16:30:55] <cannap> yea when i ask then i try and give an answer
[16:31:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:31:14] <cannap> hi
[16:31:16] <cannap> :D
[16:32:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:33:18] <cannap> jk sometimes i just talk to much bullshit sry
[16:48:47] <arosen> robertmaxrees: have you have used masonry js  (https://masonry.desandro.com/layout.html)
[16:49:20] <arosen> the other issue i'm hitting is when elements are removed from the screen this library reorders them to fit tightly again :/
[16:50:54] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're using masonry...
[16:51:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, look at capping the total # of results.
[16:51:27] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  i don't think capping the total number of results solves this issue though.
[16:51:34] <arosen> the problem is on the removal of items
[16:51:46] <robertmaxrees> erm...
[16:51:49] <arosen> when a tile is removed it reorders them
[16:51:52] <robertmaxrees> what kind of info are you presenting them?
[16:52:13] <arosen> images.
[16:52:24] <arosen> in 2 columns with different heights.
[16:52:34] <robertmaxrees> are they search results or something?
[16:52:49] <arosen> yup
[16:53:12] <robertmaxrees> heh, yeah, most people cap at 100 results and then force pagination.
[16:53:24] <robertmaxrees> and don't worry about unloading results.
[16:53:37] <arosen> as in like on the next pagnation they remove all the previous items?
[16:53:47] <arosen> i was hoping to have it be super smooth.
[16:53:47] <robertmaxrees> or just reload thje page.
[16:54:17] <robertmaxrees> if the user can't find what they need within 100 results, their search isn't well refined enough.
[16:54:44] <arosen> gotcha, yea maybe this is a corner case.
[16:55:04] <robertmaxrees> it's not necessarily a corner case, just a good example of what to actually spend time worrying about.
[16:55:12] <arosen> right
[17:05:35] <Sayona> Hi, I use this 'images' => 'required|mimes:jpeg,bmp,png', and i try to upload .jpg and not work
[17:07:14] <cannap> nice
[17:07:35] <Sayona>  -mimeType: "image/jpeg"
[17:07:45] <cannap> yes
[17:07:55] <cannap> you can also do images/*
[17:07:59] <cannap> but
[17:08:17] <cannap> looks not like a jquery problem :D
[17:08:47] <Sayona> ah sorry
[17:09:01] <cannap> some server response?
[17:09:01] <Sayona> wrong chat :P
[18:10:10] <zenox> there's a nasty bug in vscode, sometimes when you edit the code, and save, it converts attribute="value" to attribute=" value " which ie doesn't like
[18:10:49] <robertmaxrees> i haven't seen that issue personally.
[18:11:05] <zenox> and speaking of pagination, i hate that sites that paginate at one result per page just for the ad views
[18:11:18] <zenox> 15 amazing facts about turnips... and 15 separate pages
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> zenox yep.  those sites are built purely for profit.
[18:12:07] <zenox> i wonder if they do make much profit
[18:12:24] <zenox> i see them employing increasingly more scummy techniques
[18:12:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:12:40] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason they get as much traffic as they do.
[18:13:08] <zenox> because people want to know about turnips?
[18:13:18] <robertmaxrees> clickbait works!
[18:13:30] <zenox> they keep appearing mixed in with my news and it pisses me off
[18:13:37] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:25:31] <zenox> is it kosher to do this where data.image is a base64 encoded string? https://pastebin.com/ZVQTDZDN
[18:26:59] <zenox> because it's throwing up: "Argument 1 of CanvasRenderingContext2D.putImageData does not implement interface ImageData"
[18:27:34] <zenox> huh,nm user error
[18:28:03] <zenox> thanks for being my rubber duck ;)
[18:28:08] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[18:28:58] <zenox> (i have a plastic gorilla for the occasion, not a rubber duck)
[18:29:11] <robertmaxrees> i have an old r2d2 figure for that.
[18:34:46] <zenox> does ie cache base64 encoded data without renewing it on each page load? ff doesn't appear to, but ie 11 isn't updating a base64 image
[18:36:45] <robertmaxrees> which version of IE?
[18:37:06] <zenox> 11, but i've just changed another field, and tried to reload the page in ie, and it isn't updating
[18:37:15] <zenox> i'm assuming it's caching an api response
[18:37:31] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[18:37:50] <robertmaxrees> IE actually follows spec on all http requests, including ajax.
[18:39:47] <zenox> oh nice, so i'll have to use funky ?rand=1234 args on all my api requests?
[18:40:10] <robertmaxrees> nah
[18:40:16] <robertmaxrees> make sure the response headers are properly set
[18:40:32] <zenox> ok, i'll double check
[18:40:49] <zenox> i'm actually interacting with something hosted locally in a self-hosted c# app
[18:41:03] <robertmaxrees> still.
[18:41:08] <robertmaxrees> gotta make sure the headers are right.
[18:41:14] <Al_nz1> I am using js and jquery to add data to a table, but each time I add I need to workout the index for the row number which I have hard coded in this example : https://hastebin.com/dejeqilaro.js
[18:41:22] <Al_nz1> how do I check row number?
[18:41:51] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 why do yopu need the row number?
[18:42:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean for the name field?
[18:42:54] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: see where it says plan.tasks[0] <--- I need to make sure that the tasks[] is the number of the tasks on the form
[18:43:05] <Al_nz1> its a templating engine
[18:43:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the name attribute.
[18:43:28] <zenox> plan.tasks[plan.tasks.length] ?
[18:43:33] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways - are you always appending a new one?
[18:43:41] <robertmaxrees> rather - appending to the list?
[18:43:51] <robertmaxrees> and not inserting somewhere random into thetable?
[18:44:01] <zenox> ah sorry, tired eyes that should be in bed
[18:44:29] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah - always add to the end
[18:44:29] <robertmaxrees> because of so, zenox gave you the basic idea :)
[18:44:52] <robertmaxrees> just get the length and use that, since the length will always be 1 higher than the current index.
[18:45:54] <zenox> wrap your value in double quotes
[18:45:56] <Al_nz1> ok, going to experiment with that on console now - nice - I like the approach
[18:46:03] <zenox> value="' + status + '" ...
[18:46:31] <robertmaxrees> ^ also: you said this was getting output by a templating engine, but you're not using it there...
[18:48:37] <Al_nz1> to get the length of plan.tasks do I need to jquery it?
[18:49:00] <robertmaxrees> i would use jquery for that.
[18:49:02] <zenox> you also have the option of using data-foobar in a tr, and retrieve it with $(this).data('foobar') in the append (though that'd be overkill for your current problem)
[18:49:36] <robertmaxrees> zenox that assumes he's using ajax to submit these :)
[18:49:43] <zenox> name="plan.tasks[' + plan.tasks.length + '].supervisor.id"
[18:50:19] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:50:27] <robertmaxrees> he doesn't have plan defined anywhere zenox
[18:50:47] <zenox> robertmaxrees, i thought it was an object outside this paste
[18:51:00] <robertmaxrees> newp.  that's probably generated server-side.
[18:51:42] <zenox> name="plan.tasks[' + $('#table_tasks > tbody > tr').length + '].supervisor.id"
[18:51:50] <zenox> or count or whatever it is ;)
[18:52:03] <Al_nz1> yeah I need to count the <tr>'s in id=table_tasks
[18:52:04] <robertmaxrees> .length is right, though probably don't need the explicit child selectors.
[18:52:13] <robertmaxrees> he just showed you one wayu to do thjat Al_nz1 :)
[18:52:37] <zenox> robertmaxrees, yeah agree about > being superfluous but was trying to keep to op's anal retentiveness
[18:52:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:52:50] <robertmaxrees> how was he being anal retentive?
[18:53:14] <zenox> #table_tasks > tbody, the > being unnecessary though, precise
[19:02:44] <Al_nz1> zenox: so if something is ghetto - is it good?
[19:03:28] <zenox> depends
[19:04:08] <zenox> rowCounter is the simplest choice i think, that's why i called it ghetto
[19:04:24] <zenox> (it's probably also the most efficient now that i've thought about it)
[19:04:52] <zenox> but listen to robertmaxrees, > is unnecessary for you
[19:05:03] <Al_nz1> ok
[19:05:06] <zenox> tbl tbody tr will suffice
[20:52:36] <Al_nz1> Can I not select the value of : <strong>Organisation: </strong><span id="organisation" th:text=" ${user.organisation}"></span> whats in the span with : var organisation = $('#organisation').val();
[21:11:16] <Al_nz1> anyone?
[21:11:41] <Al_nz1> ping zenox
