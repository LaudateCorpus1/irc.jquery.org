[00:00:25] <RockinAkin> so when you click (not drag) on either extreme on the exposure range - the other sliders jump to their extremes?
[00:00:51] <Jattenalle> oooh!
[00:00:53] <Jattenalle> i see what you mean now
[00:00:54] <Jattenalle> no
[00:01:07] <Jattenalle> have to drag the exposure slider around a bit before they jump
[00:01:13] <RockinAkin> right
[00:01:16] <RockinAkin> that's my problem
[00:01:36] <RockinAkin> (man, i was getting so confused if it was just on my end!)
[00:01:44] <RockinAkin> any idea why it would be doing that?
[00:01:56] <Jattenalle> Cork, on the exposure slider, click either end of it and drag, it doesnt adjust the three other sliders until you drag it around a bit
[00:02:57] <Jattenalle> from what i can see RockinAkin, you're doing it wrong, the sliders dont make sense if you drag exposure up and down a bit
[00:03:02] <Jattenalle> it'll slide different sliders
[00:03:04] <Jattenalle> :/
[00:03:39] <RockinAkin> hmm?
[00:04:33] <RockinAkin> the exposure slider is meant to affect the other sliders...  the behavior it has when you're dragging it is what I want.
[00:04:46] <RockinAkin> it just doesn't work if you click on the range line to jump to that position
[00:05:57] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: LOL! this._super() doesn't exist.
[00:06:18] <swemoney> hehe. i fixed it. had the wrong version of jquery selected.
[00:06:26] <swemoney> but now it’s doing nothin’
[00:06:31] <swemoney> http://jsfiddle.net/uYRre/3/
[00:06:34] <Xliff|Bounce> Thanks.
[00:08:16] <swemoney> the template isn’t rendering at all for some reason.
[00:09:11] <swemoney> oh crap. forgot the files container.
[00:10:40] <Cork> RockinAkin: what is $('#ev_input').is(':focus') meant to do in there?
[00:11:46] <RockinAkin> it's to run that code when the exposure slider is the one being adjusted.
[00:12:14] <Cork> RockinAkin: focus is a VERY bad test for that
[00:12:24] <Cork> $('#ev_input')[0] == this is prob what you want
[00:13:54] <RockinAkin> oh yeah?  why is that if I can ask?
[00:14:16] <Cork> RockinAkin: cause focus is where the users input focus is
[00:14:25] <Cork> it doesn't have to be on the element that fired the event
[00:14:33] <Cork> while this is the element the event was on
[00:14:48] <Cork> btw if you prefer you can do $('#ev_input').is(this)
[00:14:56] <Cork> it is basically the same thing though
[00:16:16] <RockinAkin> ok.  so would I change it to this?:     if ($('#ev_input').is(this)) {
[00:17:28] <Cork> yes
[00:17:35] <Cork> RockinAkin: also if you step through the code
[00:17:59] <Cork> you result in all the values being locked when you click larger ranges
[00:18:41] <Cork> so ya, it looks like your formula is the problem
[00:19:50] <Cork> RockinAkin: first test ev = 23; sv_calc == -14 == sv_lock (reset
[00:20:24] <Cork> second test tv_calc == 22 == tv_lock (rest)
[00:20:54] <Cork> third test: av_calc == 23 == av_lock (reset)
[00:21:00] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: I think your templates are broken. You also forgot to include tmpl.js... https://rawgit.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates/master/js/tmpl.js
[00:21:11] <Cork> so you base the rules on how big jumps you get
[00:22:14] <Cork> RockinAkin: not sure what it is you actually want, but apparently you think you get something other then you actually get
[00:22:25] <RockinAkin> hmmm, i think i understand but im not sure I follow 100%
[00:23:22] <Cork> RockinAkin: the check sets the values back to the initial values if the _lock is true
[00:23:47] <Cork> and the lock is true if the formulas result in too big or small numbers
[00:24:04] <Cork> so if you get big jumps all the silders will be left in the original position
[00:25:57] <RockinAkin> ah, i think I get it
[00:26:13] <RockinAkin> but im not clear on how I'd fix that
[00:26:31] <Cork> RockinAkin: as i don't follow what it is you want to happen
[00:26:38] <Cork> i can't really help you
[00:26:51] <RockinAkin> basically what happens when you click and drag the exposure slider
[00:26:58] <RockinAkin> that's the correct behavior
[00:27:23] <Cork> that doesn't really help
[00:27:28] <Jattenalle> RockinAkin, but it isnt.. the way it changes the sliders is not consistent
[00:27:31] <Cork> i'm not into reverse enginering your page
[00:27:34] <RockinAkin> it will first affect the sensitivity slider until it reaches its limit.
[00:27:41] <Jattenalle> drag exposure all the way to the left, so that all sliders are in their max positions
[00:27:51] <Jattenalle> then drag exposure to the right until two sliders have moved
[00:27:51] <RockinAkin> then it will affect the shutter speed until it's at it's limit
[00:27:54] <Jattenalle> drag it back to the left
[00:27:55] <RockinAkin> and so on up
[00:27:57] <Cork> RockinAkin: what is the lock meant to do?
[00:27:58] <Jattenalle> the order changes, the behaviour changes
[00:28:12] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: http://jsfiddle.net/SP2Wj/1/ .. I stole someone else’s fileupload fiddle. heh. That’s what I’m talking about. testing for the id in the add callback, returns an empty array.
[00:28:19] <RockinAkin> the checkboxes?
[00:28:52] <RockinAkin> they're if the user wants the value for that slider to remain there no matter what
[00:29:10] <RockinAkin> so basically, the EV slider wont affect the locked slider anymore
[00:29:13] <Cork> RockinAkin: but the checkboxes isn't controlling the _lock variables
[00:29:13] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: OK, good.
[00:29:26] <Xliff|Bounce> They are using a function, here. Not templates.
[00:30:01] <RockinAkin> i was using the checkboxes to enable the lock - as well as if a slider reaches its limit, that enables the lock as well
[00:30:11] <RockinAkin> does that make sense?
[00:30:59] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: right. I get the same result when using the template.
[00:31:03] <Cork> RockinAkin: sounds like what you want is to clip the values to the max
[00:31:09] <Cork> RockinAkin: instead of locking them
[00:31:10] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: And they are using strings, which is still ick,
[00:31:42] <swemoney> ya. i tried that and it worked… kinda. but yes. ick.
[00:31:42] <RockinAkin> well the lock tells the exposure slider to affect the next slider up from the locked one
[00:31:48] <Cork> RockinAkin: am i understanding the checkboxes right if they are ment to prevent the slider from moving?
[00:31:57] <RockinAkin> yes
[00:32:15] <RockinAkin> checkboxes are meant to lock whatever the slider's value currently is
[00:33:02] <Xliff|Bounce> swemonkey: There is actually an add event that does get fired.
[00:33:19] <Cork> RockinAkin: ok, so what you want is ex. sv_calc = Math.min(Math.max(sv_calc, 0), 8)
[00:33:30] <Cork> RockinAkin: and after that have a check for the sv_lock
[00:33:38] <Cork> and if the lock is true set it to the sv_input
[00:33:43] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: ya, the add event gets fired.. but it gets fired before the “template” is renders..
[00:33:46] <Xliff|Bounce> I've forked the fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/qgf9L/
[00:33:48] <Cork> and NOT using sv_input in the normal formulas
[00:34:19] <Xliff|Bounce> swemoney: Really? It logs the DOM element to the console and it exists. That can't be before it renders, can it?
[00:35:16] <RockinAkin> but when the SV (sensitivity) slider reaches it's limit, how will it know to start affecting the next slider up? (TV or shutter speed)
[00:35:30] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: When I run it and add a file, all I see in the console is [] … when I add a 2nd file, THEN I see the #test-template element.. but that’s because the first file added it.
[00:36:02] <Xliff|Bounce> Not what I'm seeing here. I see it fire on the first one.
[00:36:08] <Xliff|Bounce> I'm using dev tree chrome
[00:36:40] <swemoney> hm.
[00:36:56] <RockinAkin> basically the exposure slider is first supposed to affect the sensitivity slider (SV), then effect the shutter speed slider (TV), then affect the aperture slider (AV)
[00:37:01] <swemoney> you’d think safari and chrome would act similarly
[00:37:48] <RockinAkin> hahaha, it's basically a 4-way balancing act
[00:38:14] <swemoney> yup. you’re right. works in chrome. lame.
[00:39:50] <Cork> RockinAkin: except that you get erratic jumps something like this http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/2/
[00:40:09] <swemoney> Xliff|Bounce: Works in Firefox too.. damn. what’s Safari’s problem!?
[00:40:42] <Xliff|Bounce> Ouch
[00:41:28] <djQuery_> why does sensitivity cause the exposer slider to go the opposite direction
[00:42:32] <RockinAkin> because sensitivity's value is reversed
[00:42:35] <RockinAkin> that's normal
[00:43:29] <RockinAkin> the formula is basically  Aperture + Shutter - Sensitivity
[00:43:48] <RockinAkin> av + tv - sv
[00:45:05] <wesleyh> anyone know why i get errors on built in functions from google closure compiler? (using kjscompiler to compile multiple files and dependencies) : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24402545/kjscompiler-gives-errors-on-javascript-built-in-functions-google-closure-compil
[00:45:05] <RockinAkin> Cork:  that example doesn't seem to work for me, the numbers jump erratically when i slide the exposure slider
[00:45:10] <djQuery_> what is the point in lines 14-16
[00:45:25] <Cork> RockinAkin: yes, cause the foruma results in jumpiness
[00:45:42] <Cork> i said that when i posted the link
[00:45:47] <RockinAkin> right
[00:46:20] <RockinAkin> that's why I have my code ordered the way it is... to first affect one slider (SV),  then the next up (Tv),  then the next up (Av)
[00:46:26] <RockinAkin> to avoid the jumpiness
[00:46:47] <RockinAkin> only problem is it doesn't work when the jump in the exposure slider is too large
[00:47:15] <djQuery_> is it doing something on mouse up?
[00:47:28] <RockinAkin> i dont think so?
[00:49:16] <djQuery_> lol every oeven exposer = 0,-5,8 for me, this might explain some of the jumpyness you saw Cork
[00:49:35] <Cork> ya
[00:49:49] <Cork> i also noticed it is only the input event that suffer from this
[00:49:55] <Cork> change does the right thing
[00:52:46] <morenoh150> never used $.ajax before. What type of response is it expecting?
[00:53:02] <Cork> morenoh150: it doesn't explect any type of response
[00:53:11] <Cork> morenoh150: it handles the data the server sends
[00:53:21] <morenoh150> Cork: so how is the success function triggered?
[00:53:26] <RockinAkin> so should I not use the input event?
[00:53:37] <morenoh150> how is the data expected to return from the server?
[00:53:40] <Cork> morenoh150: by the content being of the type the server says
[00:53:50] <Cork> and the server sending a 2xx http response
[00:54:21] <Cork> RockinAkin: you have to identify why the input event gives you the spasm
[00:55:17] <RockinAkin> hmmm
[00:55:42] <RockinAkin> hahaha, this is a tough one
[00:56:35] <djQuery_> RockinAkin, why do you need to calculate on change of the check boxes?
[00:57:16] <RockinAkin> i suppose i dont actually
[00:57:49] <phiz> ok
[00:58:19] <Cork> RockinAkin: ah, found what it is
[00:58:30] <Cork> RockinAkin: your formulas isn't consistent
[00:58:45] <Cork> RockinAkin: if you run the function on unchanged sliders, they move
[00:59:15] <Cork> so if the sliders is the value the formula should result in, you get a different result
[00:59:24] <morenoh150> Cork: aw sweet thanks!
[00:59:50] <Cork> RockinAkin: and i think that is cause you base equations on values you later change in the formula
[01:00:12] <RockinAkin> do you have an example I can see?
[01:00:28] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/3/
[01:00:45] <Cork> RockinAkin: move the exposure slide to -12
[01:00:50] <Cork> and then click the handle
[01:02:38] <RockinAkin> im sorry, not sure i follow, the sliders are still jumping around erratically.
[01:03:19] <Cork> RockinAkin: that is the point i'm making
[01:03:35] <Cork> RockinAkin: if you set it to a value and then click the handle == no value change
[01:03:46] <Cork> the equation runs on the same value, but the result values changes
[01:04:40] <RockinAkin> so how would this be fixed?
[01:05:01] <Cork> RockinAkin: hmm
[01:05:05] <Cork> wait a min...
[01:05:52] <Cork> LOL
[01:06:02] <Cork> i just noticed that you didn't use the _calc in the formula...
[01:06:09] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/4/ <-- fixed
[01:06:47] <Cork> so ya, the formula calculated with the wrong values... >_<'
[01:09:34] <Cork> RockinAkin: and a cleaned up version http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/5/
[01:09:37] <RockinAkin> oh snap
[01:10:45] <Cork> removed the unneeded .is(':checked') code too http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/6/
[01:11:47] <RockinAkin> oh man
[01:12:04] <RockinAkin> i have to go over this a bit to digest what you've done
[01:12:14] <RockinAkin> but it seems like it's working!
[01:12:50] <Cork> RockinAkin: the core of the problem was that you used _input in the formulas
[01:12:58] <Cork> ugg
[01:13:05] <Cork> i didn't replace all of them (just the needed ones)
[01:13:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/7/
[01:13:29] <Cork> there, that should be all
[01:16:18] <RockinAkin> man you rock.
[01:16:21] <RockinAkin> hahaha
[01:16:52] <Cork> the code cleaned up nicely too :)
[01:18:17] <RockinAkin> for sure!
[01:18:46] <RockinAkin> can I ask what putting the 'event' in the exposureCalc() is for?
[01:19:08] <Cork> RockinAkin: debugging the event types
[01:19:12] <Cork> to see what event.type was
[01:19:19] <Cork> meaning, unneeded now
[01:21:00] <RockinAkin> ok. :)
[01:21:29] <RockinAkin> man, it's great.... much simpler than how I was approaching it.
[01:23:17] <RockinAkin> thank you very much for your help Cork.  I really appreciate it.
[01:23:22] <Cork> np :)
[01:23:35] <Cork> was interesting understanding what was suppose to happen ^^'
[01:25:49] <RockinAkin> yeah, it's a little confusing
[01:26:55] <RockinAkin> so could I ask you one more thing -
[01:27:05] <Cork> sure
[01:27:48] <RockinAkin> if you were to lock the Shutter value right from the start, and then slide the exposure slider until both the Sensitivity and Aperture value are at their limits
[01:28:12] <RockinAkin> the exposure slider is still allowed to slide beyond that point
[01:28:41] <RockinAkin> how would I approach stopping it at that limit point - when none of the other sliders can move anymore.
[01:28:50] <RockinAkin> makes sense?
[01:29:55] <Cork> RockinAkin: just realized one thing
[01:30:02] <Cork> the min max value is hard coded in the formula
[01:30:25] <Cork> but it could just as well be grabbed from the sliders .prop('min')/.prop('max') value
[01:31:31] <RockinAkin> right
[01:31:45] <RockinAkin> that's ok though, those min and max values are fixed anyways
[01:31:48] <RockinAkin> they'll never change
[01:32:00] <Cork> RockinAkin: and in the if case for ev_input after all the other if cases
[01:32:17] <Cork> do the ev_calc again
[01:32:32] <Cork> that should actually be all you need
[01:33:18] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/9/
[01:34:26] <eldariond> hi !
[01:34:33] <RockinAkin> hahaha, amazing
[01:34:37] <RockinAkin> that's perfect
[01:37:21] <eldariond> I use a $.fn function like that : myfunc() { $(this).find('obj').fadeIn(); } If myfunc is called via $('a').click(), the function works, but if I use $("a[href='url']").myFunc();, it doesn't
[01:38:06] <RockinAkin> Cork: thank you
[01:38:18] <RockinAkin> how long have you been doing this stuff if I can ask?
[01:38:30] <Cork> RockinAkin: 90's :)
[01:38:31] <eldariond> an alert($this).html()); in myFunc works for .click() but is empty for the other one
[01:38:52] <RockinAkin> oh man!
[01:39:13] <RockinAkin> i've certainly got a long way to go.
[01:39:34] <RockinAkin> but this has been eye opening... i appreciate it.
[01:40:29] <Cork> RockinAkin: the change i talked about before http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/12/
[01:40:35] <Cork> no magic numbers!
[01:43:44] <dddh> hm
[01:44:36] <Cork> eldariond: cause $.fn expects the functions to be plugins
[01:44:40] <dddh> how to set timeout and cancel another queued similar function?
[01:44:47] <Cork> eldariond: and in plugins this is NOT the target element
[01:44:50] <eldariond> Cork: can you tell me more about that ?
[01:44:57] <eldariond> ah ok
[01:45:10] <dddh> I can set setTimeout, but do not know how to check if another is waiting too
[01:45:22] <eldariond> Cork: do I need to use a classical function ?
[01:45:29] <Cork> dddh: save the timer id
[01:45:37] <Cork> eldariond: no
[01:45:39] <Cork> one min
[01:46:32] <dddh> Cork: for example start it with "on('change'" and check from before executing that function check that timer is > 1 second?
[01:48:07] <eldariond> Cork: well, how can I handle that ?
[01:48:11] <Cork> eldariond: http://jsfiddle.net/tvJz5/
[01:48:31] <Cork> is that somewhat what you're trying to do?
[01:49:21] <Cork> dddh: var timer; .on('change', function() { clearTimeout(timer); timer = setTimeout(func, time); });
[01:49:58] <dddh> oh
[01:50:07] <dddh> Cork: I didn't know about clearTimeout
[01:50:24] <eldariond> Cork: ok I'll work on it, thank you so much for your help
[01:50:28] <Cork> dddh: it's the only way to can touch old timers
[01:50:38] <Cork> eldariond: didn't do much, but sure
[01:50:43] <RockinAkin> Cork - http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/13/ - I added a bit of code to limit the number of checked locks to 2.  Is there a more clean/elegant way to write do this than what I did?
[01:51:09] <Cork> RockinAkin: don't EVER use attr('disabled'
[01:51:21] <Cork> you want to change the property not the attribute
[01:51:41] <RockinAkin> ok!
[01:51:56] <Cork> RockinAkin: and to answer your question; yes there is
[01:54:25] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/14/
[01:57:20] <dddh> Cork: thank you, I had problem with .load() on change
[01:57:34] <krambiorix> hi, an ajax request sends me an xml file url . How can i open browser's dialog Download file ?
[01:58:07] <dddh> need to find some way to cancel currently loading if something is changing again
[01:58:07] <Cork> krambiorix: you would have to generate a data blob and set that to an a tag
[01:58:14] <RockinAkin> awesome
[01:58:23] <Cork> i think you can then trigger a .click() on the link
[01:58:25] <Cork> but not fully sure
[01:58:39] <Cork> krambiorix: don't forget the download attribute on the link
[01:59:08] <Cork> RockinAkin: btw the ev_lock is ignored :)
[01:59:23] <Cork> and i can't see how you can have one
[01:59:28] <Cork> so you might want to remove that one
[02:00:00] <RockinAkin> right... well what I was thinking was to duplicate and alter the code for the other sliders as well
[02:00:28] <RockinAkin> so that EV can be locked so that the other 3 sliders cant affect it
[02:00:32] <Cork> RockinAkin: why would you need to?
[02:00:45] <Cork> ah
[02:01:12] <RockinAkin> so someone can lock down on the EV number and the other sliders will compensate :)
[02:01:13] <Cork> RockinAkin: you might not have to duplicate the code
[02:01:23] <RockinAkin> oh really?
[02:03:30] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/15/
[02:03:36] <Cork> not sure if that is what you want though
[02:05:17] <RockinAkin> except the EV slider doesn't work now
[02:05:40] <Cork> O_o'
[02:05:56] <Cork> AH
[02:06:01] <Cork> ya, i missed something
[02:06:16] <RockinAkin> :)  quite a crazy 4-way balancing act.
[02:06:18] <RockinAkin> haha
[02:07:11] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/16/
[02:07:48] <Cork> RockinAkin: you might want to disable the slider when it is locked
[02:07:56] <Cork> to make the ui less weird :)
[02:08:25] <RockinAkin> i think this version has my original problem
[02:08:35] <Cork> hmm av is broken now for some reason...
[02:08:39] <RockinAkin> where if I jump the EV value by too much the other sliders freak out
[02:09:18] <Cork> hmm i don't see any such problem here
[02:09:51] <RockinAkin> hmm
[02:10:03] <Cork> but ya there is a bug in the last ev_calc
[02:10:11] <RockinAkin> thats why I was originally limiting the code to if the current slider is active

[02:11:31] <Cork> RockinAkin: only problem i see with the last one is that sensitivity is locked if you lock exposure
[02:11:35] <Cork> not sure why yet though
[02:11:54] <RockinAkin> yep, it's getting close
[02:13:54] <krambiorix> Cork, any example on that?  >>you would have to generate a data blob and set that to an a tag
[02:16:04] <Cork> krambiorix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob#Example_for_creating_a_URL_to_a_typed_array_using_a_blob
[02:18:45] <Cork> RockinAkin: ah, not i think i know what the problem is
[02:20:33] <RockinAkin> yeah?
[02:22:27] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/19/
[02:23:18] <Cork> with better indentation http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/20/
[02:24:30] <krambiorix> Cork, isn't there a crossbrowser solution?
[02:24:50] <Cork> krambiorix: that one is cross browser
[02:25:01] <Cork> it depends on new features so it doesn't work in older ies
[02:25:17] <Cork> krambiorix: if you mean you need pre ie10 support, then no there is no solution for that
[02:25:50] <Cork> except linking to the xml file from the server
[02:28:24] <RockinAkin> cork!  its so close - I think the EV limit is gone now though.   if shutter is locked at the beginning and ev is slid, it's not limited one Sv and Av cant move anymore
[02:29:24] <Cork> ah, right
[02:29:40] <krambiorix> Cork, i've done that, but the blob data opens in a new tab and not as a file download popup... Any idea?
[02:29:49] <Cork> added a check to the last if case "for consistency"...
[02:29:52] <Cork> silly me...
[02:30:08] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/21/
[02:30:28] <Cork> krambiorix: did you set the download="name" attribute?
[02:31:33] <krambiorix> Cork, aaah i got it, i had to create a hidden <a> and link to the created url
[02:31:49] <Cork> krambiorix: hmm, and just noticed
[02:31:57] <Cork> the download attribute isn't supported in ie :/
[02:32:00] <Cork> at all...
[02:32:09] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#Browser_compatibility
[02:32:42] <krambiorix> Cork, ok
[02:32:51] <krambiorix> Cork, it works, i'm happy! and thanks alot!!
[02:32:58] <Cork> krambiorix: np
[02:33:59] <RockinAkin> cork - can that same limiter that the EV slider has work with the other sliders as well?
[02:34:09] <RockinAkin> like if Ev and Sv are locked at the start
[02:34:33] <RockinAkin> and Tv is slid, then av compensates, but Tv can still be slid once Av hits it's limit
[02:35:30] <RockinAkin> this code is brilliant though... so much more efficient than how I was thinking about it
[02:36:08] <Cork> RockinAkin: possibly
[02:36:21] <Cork> but you are getting to a point where you get circular dependencies
[02:36:27] <Cork> and if you hit that you have to loop
[02:37:46] <Cork> RockinAkin: http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/22/
[02:38:02] <Cork> but as you see you start to get VERY close to repeating the same if statements over and over again
[02:38:33] <Cork> and ah, ya there is one bug more
[02:38:42] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/z5gSF/23/
[02:41:44] <RockinAkin> crazy
[02:42:08] <RockinAkin> yes, it does certainly get really close to circular logic
[02:42:50] <Cork> on thinking through it a little more
[02:42:51] <Cork> it isn't
[02:43:00] <Cork> cause the last list is just for the current element
[02:43:22] <Cork> and you could have logic to just run it for the current one (though that is most likely more costly then the simple math)
[02:43:35] <Cork> so ya, this should be safe
[02:44:30] <RockinAkin> great, im going to study this closely... it's great that it's so simple and clean.
[02:45:01] <RockinAkin> my way of approaching it was pretty ham-fisted, now that I've seen this. :)
[02:45:24] <RockinAkin> one more time, thank you for your help Cork!

[03:01:09] <asgasg> this is not really a jquery-specific question, but maybe someone can help me. I try to get google chrome remote debugging running, so I can debug jquery for a website running on my android device.
[03:01:15] <asgasg> i've got a galaxy s4, usb-debugging is active on the device. when I connect it to a windows 7 machine, I've only got the options to choose between "mass storage" or "camera" on my phone.
[03:01:27] <asgasg> the device is recognized in the windows device manager, but chrome://inspect says it didn't recognize a device, chrome (win7 is v35), adb-plugin is installed although chrome says that it's not needed anymore
[03:01:33] <asgasg> do i need eclipse with the android sdk installed although I don't develop an app?
[03:12:00] <Amnesia> question, I've got the following function: https://privatepaste.com/dd82bd11b2 but I'd like it to be compacter, the assignment of the three td's is kinda ugly imo, but td1,td2,td3 = $('<td>') created three variables to the same td

[03:53:40] <dietcode> worked it out...
[03:59:13] <decx> erming clone would be a tiny bit faster than creating 100 new fragments, but it's negligible
[03:59:52] <erming> i see.. i might create ~2k of them though

[04:31:37] <Cork> ubilli8: ok?
[04:31:42] <Cork> so bind a submit event
[04:31:42] <ubilli8> Cork : please i have done that but it is sending the form before exectuing it..
[04:32:03] <ubilli8> @cork : how do you mean?
[04:32:19] * Cork points at the line he posted two mins ago
[04:33:34] <ubilli8> @cork : then this is the html ....
[04:33:54] <Cork> ubilli8: you don't have a submit event handler
[04:33:55] <Cork> so bind one
[04:34:28] <ubilli8> http://laravel.io/bin/062be
[04:34:45] <Cork> don't use event attributes
[04:34:58] <Cork> and yes that would explain why you have problems
[04:35:05] <ubilli8> this is the html i used a onsubmit event stilll it is still having the same issues..
[04:35:19] <Cork> yes remove the event attribute and bind an event listener instead

[05:04:11] <sunel> in that if i load the xml node title with "&" jQuery does not respond
[05:04:34] <systemfault> sunel: escape it with &amp; ?
[05:04:34] <sunel> if the "&" is removed it works

[05:05:01] <sunel> is there any other option and y is this happening
[05:05:19] <systemfault> sunel: Because the spec says it's invalid.
[05:05:25] <systemfault> XML is like that.
[05:05:30] <Cork> xml isn't error correcting
[05:05:33] <Cork> it fails on error

[05:43:17] <Cork> juslintek: what do you mean by "content"?
[05:43:23] <Cork> number of chars in text?
[05:43:25] <juslintek> text
[05:43:27] <Cork> number of child elements?
[05:43:31] <juslintek> numbers in text
[05:43:38] <juslintek> child elements yes
[05:43:39] <Cork> if($('span').text().length < 6) {}
[05:43:46] <juslintek> thanx
[05:43:46] <Cork> uh
[05:43:56] <Cork> that is if you want to test text
[05:44:04] <Cork> not if you want to test children
[05:44:20] <juslintek> Well its not lenght is need i need the int value
[05:44:31] <Cork> int value of what??
[05:44:40] <ivh> Hi! I want to make a $.ajax() request to a different host Y, according to CORS. It seems to work, but a GET request gets sent by the browser, even though Y sends the header Access-Control-Allow-Methods=HEAD to allow only HEAD requests. Is there any way I can force the CORS preflight request for GET requests?
[05:44:46] <Cork> juslintek: i think you need to make a fiddle
[05:44:50] <ubilli8> please how do i validate a check box???
[05:45:28] <Cork> ubilli8: validate?
[05:45:36] <Cork> are you talking about jquery.validate.js?
[05:45:55] <juslintek> because with onclick inline function i json html content in #register .main-body, which contains only one span and that span is countdown, so I want js to detect its value, and if it is less then 6 it increments it till it reaches limit 6.
[05:46:59] <juslintek> I think length is more for number of chars in specified selector
[05:47:30] <juslintek> which identifier calculates int value?
[05:47:42] <Cork> juslintek: your question makes no sense
[05:47:46] <ubilli8> no please..
[05:48:07] <ubilli8> my form has a check box  please how do i validate it??
[05:48:27] <Cork> ubilli8: define validate then
[05:48:44] <juslintek> How to check if item within span selector is less then 6 as a number.
[05:48:47] <Cork> or make a fiddle with a demo so you can show what you're trying to do
[05:49:18] <Cork> juslintek: you want to check if the selector text is less then six chars??
[05:49:39] <Cork> as in 'span' == 4?
[05:49:43] <juslintek> Cork, not chars, 6 as a number, number numpad 6
[05:49:53] <Cork> juslintek: again your question makes no sense
[05:50:06] <Cork> you are better of making a jsfiddle with your problem
[05:50:14] <juslintek> <span>4</span> is is less then 6 now?
[05:50:40] <Cork> if(parseInt($('span').text(), 10) < 6) {}
[05:50:56] <juslintek> thank you very much DEAR Cork. :-)
[05:56:10] <juslintek> Cork what if that content I checking is only available after some button is pressed, how can I make continuous check for that span?
[05:56:31] <juslintek> Because currently it does nothing, it seems that it can't find anything.
[05:56:42] <Cork> juslintek: you can't
[05:56:58] <konda> s
[05:57:00] <Cork> juslintek: best is to create a function and have the event from the button run it
[05:57:15] <juslintek> ah it only checks on page load
[05:57:21] <Cork> no
[05:57:28] <Cork> it only checks then the code you write is ran
[05:58:09] <juslintek> I was talking about previous one, which is rand from head
[05:58:13] <juslintek> ran*
[05:58:47] <Cork> if you mean the code i gave you it checks once when the code is ran
[05:58:55] <Cork> juslintek: if you put that in head and nothing else
[05:59:02] <Cork> it will check before the body element is created
[05:59:05] <Cork> so won't work
[05:59:21] <Cork> if you run it inside a ready event it will run when the body has been constructed
[06:01:38] <juslintek> Cork, I've pasted some of the code, all of it is too long its a huge project. http://jsfiddle.net/z37Zn/1/
[06:01:49] <juslintek> I'm working from yii framework
[06:01:56] <juslintek> on*
[06:02:49] <juslintek> TbButton is class which constructs Bootstrap button, with onclick function, which you can see is made within quotes inline. And in script is the script I'm trying to run.
[06:03:12] <juslintek> Now it seems everything is running, but script makes no reaction it should output incremental value of i into console
[06:03:15] <juslintek> but it doesn't
[06:03:18] <Cork> juslintek: why not just pass the value from the original function?
[06:03:35] <Cork> instead of parsing it again from the dom?
[06:03:42] <juslintek> it via setTimeout seems to output it only once
[06:04:10] <juslintek> i want it to be continious so it would be you will be redirected to your account within 5 seconds
[06:04:14] <juslintek> and seconds would be ticking
[06:04:33] <Cork> juslintek: well you have the i variable in the timeout function
[06:04:36] <Cork> just pass that on
[06:04:59] <tpyo> ive got some layout code that appears to be firing "too soon". the element's position reports itself as 0. If I put in a setTimeout I can get the correct result. Is there something I can use to ensure my code is run _after_ the page has finished its first render?
[06:05:52] <tpyo> or first "layout" perhaps
[06:06:21] <Cork> tpyo: you're most likely not waiting for ready
[06:06:34] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com ready

[06:06:36] <b-ot> Cork: .ready() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/ready/

[06:07:34] <Cork> juslintek: you have no on call
[06:07:36] <juslintek> I get in console 0 only once
[06:07:44] <Cork> so not sure what code section you're talking about
[06:07:59] <juslintek> I have to get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
[06:08:10] <Cork> i know what you need
[06:08:13] <Cork> but now where
[06:08:24] <juslintek> I'll fix it and give you a line
[06:12:13] <juslintek> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/z37Zn/3/ html line 42 and readon comment as well, now function is called from else, but it returns to console "0" only once.
[06:12:43] <Cork> juslintek: ugg...
[06:12:50] <Cork> you should move the js out of the html
[06:13:00] <Cork> it makes it REALLY messy to handle
[06:13:13] <juslintek> give me a minute
[06:13:28] <Cork> like i said before; don't use event attributes
[06:17:18] <konda> Hey, can anyone see this? ;D
[06:17:25] <Axman6> no
[06:17:35] <konda> thanks.
[06:17:47] <Axman6> can't see that either

[06:22:40] <JustMozzy> hey guys. I was testing a jquery ui dialog on an iPhone 4 iOS 6 and noticed that when I scroll down in the page, the modal window seems to try to keep itself in the viewport. no other device behaves this way. does anyone have an idea to as why?
[06:23:20] <Cork> JustMozzy: wouldn't surprise me if it is ios browser doing it
[06:23:32] <Cork> mobile browsers does a lot of weird things
[06:23:50] <Cork> especially ios and android default browser
[06:24:56] <JustMozzy> Cork: I hope I can fix it. there's a quite long form in the modal window. if I cannot fix it it means ios6 users will not be able to fill out the form lol
[06:25:10] <Plux> I'm working on a webpage where I am using jQuery UI with tabs and several accordion elements. I'm also using tooltips (using the qTip2 library) to show helpfull tooltips on mouseover. Now I want to create a "help" button that would toggle the display of all tooltips to visible elements (visible to the user, not as in having the "visible" attribute as true), but I can't figure out how to get it to work. I'm not sure how jQuery UI hides t
[06:25:22] <Cork> JustMozzy: i haven't ever used the jquery ui dialog on touch devices
[06:25:35] <Plux>  seem to not be marked as hidden or anything). And when I show all tooltips, I get a lot of "extra" tooltips of elements that are not visible. Does anyone know of a good solution to this, or can point me in the right direction to one?
[06:25:36] <Cork> only there slider and a few other similar widgets
[06:26:30] <juslintek> Cork, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/z37Zn/5/
[06:27:10] <Cork> juslintek: yes, now you have scope you can use to group tings together
[06:27:22] <Cork> (it is the main problems with event attributes)
[06:27:34] <juslintek> Well now, it does nothing, even though I added ID to button
[06:27:53] <juslintek> it doesn't detect the event from javascript
[06:28:32] <Cork> juslintek: you're prob running the selector before the content has been added
[06:29:01] <Cork> if you're js is in head you need to wrap it in ready: $(function() {});
[06:29:40] <juslintek> Cork, yes, but how do I alternate it?
[06:29:58] <juslintek> ok, will do that
[06:30:33] <Cork> juslintek: http://jsfiddle.net/z37Zn/6/
[06:33:07] <JustMozzy> hmm... I traced the problem down to not being a jquery ui issue... though this is something really weird. when I scroll a window.resize event is triggered :/
[06:33:31] <juslintek> Cork, now it works, but still problem of i reaching console.log only once persists.
[06:33:51] <Cork> juslintek: i changed what the timeout function does
[06:33:55] <Cork> check that again
[06:35:33] <koell> does jquery forum has tapatalk?
[06:35:44] <NoiseEee> mmm tapas
[06:35:50] <koell> tapas?
[06:40:35] <juslintek> Cork, I've fixed few things here: http://jsfiddle.net/z37Zn/8/ but now I get undefined i, even though it is predefined, before function call.
[06:44:34] <juslintek> Fixed that as well, now it seems, that setTimeout is not working.. http://jsfiddle.net/z37Zn/9/
[06:45:42] <juslintek> it instantly refreshes the page.
[06:46:02] <juslintek> seems like it skips setTimeout and increments i to 6 straight away.
[06:47:06] <Edvard> hi
[06:47:36] <juslintek> Cork, fixed it it was my bad, shouldn't have added var to function call as option, thought it is necessary.
[06:49:56] <Es0teric> quick question about looping through array of objects… i have objects that contain elements with classes, when i extract the .text() in the class that i point it to, it appends text from two elements that have the same class
[06:50:02] <Es0teric> why is that? this is on a $.each() btw
[07:02:16] <Macaveli> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/VWOU/npcMU/ demonstrating the problem as you click next you notice the slice has removed the 10th job the following code is responsible for dicing -> http://pastie.org/private/3k5naa499g054rsjkf5z3q Why is it removing the 10th?
[07:02:23] <Macaveli> Cork, ^
[07:05:00] <Edvard> is tinysort recommended?
[07:05:24] <BillCriswell> Edvard: It does the job and it's tiny. Don't see why not.
[07:05:42] <Edvard> i was trying to use jquery or js to sort a list
[07:06:01] <Edvard> i am creating a top ten list and wish to sort by rating and the hide all but 10
[07:06:19] <BillCriswell> Edvard: Got ya.
[07:06:28] <Edvard> or am i best sorting the array first
[07:06:40] <Edvard> not sure about the best approach for this
[07:06:52] <BillCriswell> If you have the data in an array I'd sort the array then output the list.
[07:07:12] <BillCriswell> Then you really wouldn't need tsort
[07:07:27] <BillCriswell> blah, tinysort*
[07:07:28] <Edvard> trying to avoid plugins
[07:07:51] <Edvard> this is my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/81/
[07:07:55] <BillCriswell> There you so then. A simple sort on an array should do the trick,.
[07:08:28] <Edvard> i mean this one: http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/88/
[07:08:49] <Edvard> i did that in this example but it makes the next lists also sort
[07:10:42] <Macaveli> Fixed my problem  :)
[07:11:25] <Edvard> the Yugo link on both pages should take you to the same page, it does not :(
[07:11:36] <Edvard> data-car changes @s
[07:11:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Trying to change a textfield width when going below a certain resolution: @media all and (max-width: 699px) {
[07:11:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob>   #search input { width: 277px;}
[07:11:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> } - but it's not working. What is wrong with it?
[07:13:49] <decx> something somewhere else
[07:15:29] <Edvard> any ideas?
[07:16:10] <BillCriswell> Edvard: Hm, that function alters the array.
[07:16:34] <Edvard> yeah data-car
[07:16:34] <Edvard> changes
[07:16:41] <BillCriswell> I meant the sort_by
[07:16:51] <Edvard> am a noob and pretty lost atm
[07:17:01] <BillCriswell> It's weird because Array.sort() doesn't alter the original array but with this sort_by it does.
[07:17:16] <Edvard> i required to sorts
[07:17:19] <Edvard> 1) a top ten page
[07:17:39] <Edvard> 2) a button on the all cars page, to sort by alpha or rating
[07:17:42] <BillCriswell> Edvard: Where did you get this sort_by function?
[07:18:43] <decx> fyi don't append to dom in loops
[07:19:41] <Edvard> name*
[07:19:41] <Edvard> would that require 1 or 2 functions?
[07:19:41] <Edvard> may just use tinysort :(
[07:19:41] <Edvard> defeated
[07:20:25] <Edvard> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/979256/sorting-an-array-of-javascript-objects?rq=1
[07:21:15] <Edvard> already thought about cutting it out
[07:24:16] <BillCriswell> Edvard: I don't like that this function alters the original array but you'd just have to resort it and slice it down to what you want.
[07:25:35] <BillCriswell> cars.sort(sort_by('rating', true)); // Gets the cars in order by their rating... In the each you can do like $.each(cars.slice(0, 3), function(){}); if you only want the top three. Then for them all just sort by whatever again.
[07:33:07] <Es0teric> if i wanted to create a count for every time a click event is fired… to check if the data is the same how would i do that?
[07:33:28] <Es0teric> for instance, user clicks on a button but the data that the button is retreiving is the same
[07:33:40] <Es0teric> i dont want it to update anything at that point, how would i do taht?
[07:39:56] <Edvard> am back , door
[07:40:43] <Edvard> wont that effect the page showing all the array
[07:40:46] <decx> i'd say make a fiddle but i know that will take too long for you yet again Es0teric ;)
[07:40:50] <Edvard> BillCriswell
[07:41:01] <Es0teric> lol decx you know me all too well
[07:41:12] <Manaus> hi, how do I get the first descendant of an element? $('article').find('> .wrapper') ?
[07:41:54] <decx> that's one way
[07:42:40] <Es0teric> when i am in a click event, i put something like num = 0; then at the end of the click event i added num++;… but its not incrimenting for every click.. why is that?
[07:42:43] <decx> by first descendant, do you mean a direct child or the first occurence of an element inside an element
[07:43:06] <decx> where do you declar var num?
[07:43:48] <Radditz> hello
[07:43:54] <Radditz> I am trying to change display none to display block
[07:43:56] <Radditz> http://jsfiddle.net/LTKzT/7/
[07:43:57] <Radditz> doesn't work
[07:43:59] <Radditz> halp
[07:44:00] <Radditz> ty
[07:44:02] <Radditz> plz
[07:44:17] <ivh> What could be the reason that jqXHR.getResponseHeader() cannot see custom headers that *are* delivered by the requested resource?
[07:45:00] <decx> because sleectionMenu is a class and not an id Radditz
[07:45:11] <Radditz> decx: I am terribly sorry
[07:45:27] <Radditz> I didn't pay attention, thank you very much decx
[07:46:29] <Es0teric> DBZ
[07:46:30] <Es0teric> ha
[07:46:32] <Es0teric> Radditz:
[07:46:37] <Radditz> heh
[07:46:51] <Es0teric> decx var num is declared inside the click event
[07:47:04] <decx> there's your problem
[07:47:12] <decx> you declare a new num everytime you click
[07:47:24] <decx> put it outside the click function
[07:47:36] <decx> that's a basic scope issue, read up on that
[07:47:59] <Es0teric> decx ohhh right right
[07:48:48] <Es0teric> decx:  thats one of my main problems in js… scopes
[07:48:55] <Es0teric> i totally get mixed up
[07:51:10] <Radditz> is there a way to set an input box to checked/unchecked without triggering the click function?
[07:51:58] <decx> $('.mycheckbox').prop('checked',true)
[07:52:11] <Radditz> decx: and it won't cause the click to be called?
[07:52:18] <decx> it wont
[07:52:20] <Radditz> decx: I registered a click event, and I need something that checks all boxes
[07:52:25] <Radditz> thank you decx
[08:03:57] <JustMozzy> Alright. So iPhone iOS6 has a bad bug. When scrolling around, the viewport gets resized and therefore a lot of resize events are called. I tried html,body  {height: 100%; overflow: auto; margin: 0;} but that took away the momentum scroll. any ideas how to get around this problem?
[08:05:58] <tsmith> Hi. I'm having a very perplexing issue with a <ul> set as a jQuery UI Sortable widget: It's height is always computed to be 0, leading to it not fitting inside its parent div. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv16n1ftlww1ro9/Screenshot%202014-06-25%2011.03.39.png
[08:07:24] <Edvard> is jquerymobile shit
[08:07:26] <Edvard> ?
[08:07:40] <Edvard> constantly told not to use it
[08:09:08] <BillCriswell> Edvard: I doubt it's shit, but if I'd do a shit load of research before I invested the time into learning it.
[08:10:07] <Edvard> what would you recommend for creating an app?
[08:10:26] <Edvard> basic directory app
[08:10:33] <Edvard> for mobile devices
[08:10:59] <BillCriswell> It depends on what I need.
[08:11:22] <d0de> Edvard, what technology are you discussing?
[08:11:53] <Edvard> html + css
[08:11:55] <Edvard> with some js
[08:12:22] <Edvard> using that to create a directory of data and include some maps
[08:15:06] <BillCriswell> Edvard: How much of jQuery UI do you plan to utilize?
[08:15:12] <BillCriswell> Er, jQuery Mobile
[08:16:15] <Edvard> right now am just using it for a visual guide
[08:16:50] <Edvard> i thought jquerymobile was designed for mobiles apps to be lightweight etc
[08:18:49] <Edvard> how would i make a single page app with jquery and not mobile
[08:19:40] <BillCriswell> Edvard: Really broad question there.
[08:20:37] <Edvard> i removed the jquerymobile  external resource and as expected all my data is on one page
[08:21:41] <d0de> I wouldn't call jQuery mobile lightweight
[08:22:19] <Edvard> so its not exactly great for making apps?
[08:22:51] <d0de> I don't know enough about to say that. But I would say that you should avoid using it if you're only going to be using a very small subset of its functionality
[08:23:10] <d0de> what do you need it to do?
[08:23:41] <Edvard> display a list of all data
[08:23:46] <Edvard> display the top ten data
[08:24:06] <Edvard> sort the all data list by: name + rating
[08:24:08] <d0de> can you give an example of the kind of data you're talking about? in a fiddle or something?
[08:24:13] <Edvard> yeah
[08:24:42] <Edvard> http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/91/
[08:25:12] <Edvard> added sort button to top right corner
[08:26:30] <decx> it's a good baseline if you dont want to invest many hours into mobile css and js for common widgets, but for your purposes jquery+underscore would probably be better in terms of performance and also what you can learn from it
[08:27:19] <Edvard> have to google this underscore
[08:27:27] <Edvard> i also wish to include a map
[08:27:39] <Edvard> is it possible to have an offline googlemap?
[08:28:16] <Edvard> or something similiar
[08:28:31] <Edvard> i can not rely on wifi for maps
[08:29:51] <Edvard> ohhmap
[08:30:17] <Edvard> thanks let me look into this more
[08:41:21] <Edvard> decx do i need backbone with underscore?
[08:44:03] <BillCriswell> Edvard: No.
[08:44:24] <BillCriswell> Underscore is built into backbone, though.
[08:46:48] <Edvard> i added the underscore but am abit lost since am using jquery already
[08:47:03] <Edvard> why replace my $.each  with _.each
[08:47:16] <BillCriswell> Edvard: They're not meant to replace eachother.
[08:47:42] <Edvard> when and how do i use underscore
[08:47:47] <Edvard> is what am trying to figure out
[08:47:47] <BillCriswell> Edvard: I'd build it with straight html, css and javascript/jquery and add things as you need them.
[08:47:55] <BillCriswell> When you need to use it for something.
[08:48:17] <Edvard> ill strip jquerymobile out
[08:48:23] <Edvard> and use styling
[08:48:35] <Edvard> then come back when i hit the sorting again
[08:50:07] <decx> i didnt mean for you to uproot all your stuff, underscore was just an example to display and sort data that you get in an array, you can do it all with jquery and native js, which would probably be better at first to prevent that you get overloaded with new concepts too fast
[08:55:22] <Edvard> i just realised
[08:55:43] <Edvard> as soon as i remove the jquery mobile.js  the pages break into a one page list
[08:56:02] <Edvard> am not sure how you make multi pages with jquery alone
[08:56:15] <duch_kazatel> pushstates/hashes and hiding content.
[08:57:02] <Edvard> its a case of hiding divs?
[08:57:42] <duch_kazatel> pretty much
[08:58:01] <Edvard> i checked the computed styles of jquery mobileand they show display: none
[08:58:05] <Edvard> which confirms
[08:58:26] <Edvard> thx
[09:00:57] <Edvard> it was using data-role="header" to apply styles, would i be best removing this and adding an id instead?
[09:01:12] <Edvard> jquerymobile used data-role
[09:01:29] <duch_kazatel> why are you ditching jquery mobile?
[09:02:02] <Edvard> i have been told various times
[09:02:14] <Edvard> that jquery alone is better
[09:02:26] <Edvard> jquerymobile is not really lightweight
[09:02:50] <Edvard> not one has actually said use jquery mobile, everyone to comment has advised against this
[09:04:36] <decx> is this a learning experience or for something productive?
[09:04:41] <Edvard> both
[09:04:42] <duch_kazatel> very true, but-
[09:04:46] <duch_kazatel> decx got their first.
[09:04:52] <Edvard> learning but am trying to make something i can use
[09:04:57] <decx> :o their
[09:05:05] <duch_kazatel> *there derp
[09:05:12] <Edvard> why learn bad practise ?
[09:05:18] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:05:27] <decx> jqm is good if you need a good baseline fast
[09:05:46] <Edvard> ok ill get it working with jquerymobile
[09:05:52] <Edvard> then progress to jquery
[09:06:06] <duch_kazatel> how familiar are you with vanilla JS?
[09:06:11] <Edvard> i am shit
[09:06:18] <Edvard> i use html, css and some jquery
[09:06:23] <duch_kazatel> I’d spend some time with that and get familiar with JS.
[09:06:24] <decx> as jqui, if you need a few widgets and don't want to put in a lot of work into edgecases and css it's good. if you want control it's all a bit too restrictive
[09:06:36] <Edvard> i  need to do codeacademy js
[09:07:26] <Edvard> maybe jquerymobile for short term
[09:07:37] <MikeD_> given a container id, is there a simple way to focus the first focusable element within it?
[09:08:21] <decx> theere's an :input selector
[09:08:57] <decx> that wil lselect inputs, selects, textareas and buttons
[09:09:21] <decx> so $('#myid').find(':input').eq(0)
[09:10:44] <MikeD_> then .focus() ?
[09:11:46] <decx> right
[09:15:06] <MikeD_> seems .focus() is a shortcut for .on("focus", handler)
[09:15:22] <MikeD_> how do i call the native focus method on the dom object?
[09:15:38] <MikeD_> nm
[09:15:40] <decx> it's also called focus()
[09:15:49] <MikeD_> "just keep reading the api"
[09:17:13] <CAmato> Does anyone know how to set the default configuration for Jquery Mobile to not use rounded corners on everything?
[09:17:27] <Jattenalle> CAmato, edit the css
[09:18:15] <duch_kazatel> *override the css imo
[09:18:21] <duch_kazatel> that way to can upgrade easily later.
[09:19:09] <decx> "95% of css unused on this site" ^^
[09:19:57] <Jattenalle> unused css is best css
[09:19:59] <CAmato> What if you would want the rounded corners to be applied only in spots where data-corner="true" otherwise it does not do anything
[09:20:24] <Jattenalle> CAmato, edit the css, and dont use data for styling, use a different class
[09:20:36] <duch_kazatel> override the CSS and write your own thing, though I’d suggest you’d use a class for that instead.
[09:20:38] <Jattenalle> override the css*
[09:21:08] <CAmato> k thx
[09:22:48] <decx> jqm uses data for styling all the time though doesnt it
[09:23:04] <Jattenalle> who knows, mobile is silly
[09:23:07] <decx> data-corners="false" data-shadow="false" data-iconshadow="true" data-icon="plus" data-iconpos="left"
[09:23:39] <decx> i'm kinda excited for the new way to apparently are going
[09:23:51] <Jattenalle> hm?
[09:23:51] <duch_kazatel> same here.  it’s smart.
[09:23:55] <decx> away from the baseline template more to a mobile toolset
[09:24:45] <arschmitz> decx: duch_kazatel: are you talking about the direction jQuery mobile is heading?
[09:24:51] <duch_kazatel> yes
[09:25:06] <decx> well i only know what you wrote a few months ago ^^
[09:25:15] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: decx: would love to hear your feed back on any of that
[09:25:26] <arschmitz> since im the one kinda driving those changes
[09:25:40] <duch_kazatel> i personally think the direction is smart.
[09:26:01] <decx> i am certainly in favor of a lean mobile toolset for navigation, pages and all that
[09:26:11] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: another thing that will be much improved in 1.5 is that all the auto enhancement will be much more optional and configurable
[09:27:12] <arschmitz> duch_kazatel: decx: one thing i recommend in terms of performance when i give talks is to use as little of the auto enhancement as possible if performance is an issue but have found currently its a LOT easier said then done
[09:27:54] <MikeD_> stupid IE: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7996577/jquery-focus-is-not-focusing-in-ie-but-it-is-in-chrome
[09:27:59] <arschmitz> also trying to make the navigation more robust and configurable
[09:29:33] <decx> i'm looking forward to it, i only ever dabbled in the current and previous versions and it always was a bit too overbearing for my tastes and requirements
[09:29:40] <arschmitz> decx: duch_kazatel: i generally am not really paying attention in here but if either of you or any one else has constructive feed back or suggestions always feel free to ping me
[09:29:48] <decx> will do
[09:29:49] <arschmitz> i really do want to hear it
[09:30:23] <litropy> I'm having a lot of trouble using multiple jquery-based .js files. I'm not very versed in jquery. I've read NoConflict docs, but I'm still looking for tips. Essentially, I'm using jquery mobile for the site's navigation, and I need to isolate that JS from, for instance, OpenCart's JS
[09:30:31] <arschmitz> decx: yeah by default it will still be a full framework but making it usable as a toolkit is a priority as well for sure
[09:31:54] <arschmitz> decx: its a process to get there for sure but we are making really good progress i think
[09:32:24] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: How often do you work on it? Always wondered about that.
[09:34:19] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: oh 60-70 hours a week lol
[09:34:49] <BillCriswell> Damn. Is that with a full time gig or is jQuery mobile your full time gig?
[09:35:06] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: i only do work for the jquery foundation
[09:35:13] <arschmitz> not all is jQuery mobile but most is
[09:35:30] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[09:35:32] <BillCriswell> Well, thanks haha
[09:35:53] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: your welcome
[09:36:07] <arschmitz> same goes for you any feedback on things we can improve i love to hear
[09:36:32] <decx> use more ' in your you're ^^
[09:36:41] <BillCriswell> If anything should come to mind I won't hesitate to mention it!
[09:40:43] <BillCriswell> Crackers are fucking delicious. Totally underrated.
[09:40:55] <decx> that's racist
[09:40:59] <systemfault> lol
[09:41:00] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: cracker of choice?
[09:41:07] <systemfault> had the same idea as decx in mind.
[09:41:09] <decx> that's also what luis suarez thought yesterday
[09:41:10] <decx> heyooo
[09:41:16] <BillCriswell> Plain ass saltine.
[09:41:28] <arschmitz> ok now its racist
[09:42:22] <BillCriswell> I thought it's ok to be racist as long as it's a reference to your own race?
[09:43:33] <CloudyOne> well it is, as long as you're okay being a hypocrit
[09:43:50] <decx> say no to cannibalism
[09:43:59] <BillCriswell> Totally fine with it.
[10:00:09] <Es0teric> what could be the case of a scrollbar trying to scrollto top again after the event was already fired and the user is trying to scroll up manually
[10:00:13] <Es0teric> *cause
[10:03:43] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Try that one again.
[10:04:30] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: ok basically i have a $(‘html’).animate() on a div after a user clicks on a button… but after that button click happens and the user tries to scroll up, it turns glitchy… what could be the cause of that?
[10:04:52] <aniasis> Hello
[10:05:02] <aniasis> ajpiano
[10:07:35] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: The user is trying to scroll while the site is scrolling for you.
[10:07:51] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: the scroll already happened at that point though
[10:08:15] <Es0teric> its not during the scroll, its after the scroll that the problem happens
[10:09:33] <MikeD_> if you've already scrolled to the top, how can someone scroll to the 'more top' ?
[10:10:19] <Es0teric> MikeD_:  just because it says scroll to top doesnt mean that the div is at the top…
[10:11:05] <MikeD_> so scroll a div to top, then manually scroll a page to top - k
[10:12:24] <Es0teric> MikeD_: the div is not at the top though...
[10:12:38] <decx> just don't animate scroll to top, it's terrible
[10:13:11] <decx> if i want to top i dont want to wait
[10:15:31] <duch_kazatel> “just because it says scroll to top doesnt mean that the div is at the top…” yeah don’t have buttons do what they say they’ll do/.
[10:15:59] <decx> worst case i've seen yet was preventing default on the home key and instead using animate scrolltop
[10:16:06] <duch_kazatel> no
[10:16:16] <decx> that's what i said!
[10:20:46] <BillCriswell> At least make it super quick, enough to know what's going on but not enough to feel like it's actually happening.
[10:21:19] <decx> 0 is an appropriate timeframe
[10:21:42] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:22:32] <BillCriswell> I don't mind it as long as it's done properly, just rarely see it happen properly.
[10:22:50] <BillCriswell> Taking over the Home key is just fucked though.
[10:36:51] <bradbrad> Guys, I have a select list. If the selected option is X, I then want to add a class to a button. Any idea how to do that?
[10:37:16] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ bradbrad
[10:37:16] <b-ot> bradbrad: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:37:47] <bradbrad> Guys, not even that far yet! To be honest I dont even know where to start!
[10:38:05] <duch_kazatel> bradbrad what do those two events have to do with one another?
[10:38:42] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel Its a drupal site with a exposed filter, and I need a reset button, but I dont want the reset button to be visible untill someone has filtered the results
[10:39:15] <bradbrad> so though to add a css class to the reset button to hide it untill they make their selection, showing the button, and allowing them to reset it
[10:40:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LUbQ8/
[10:40:49] <duch_kazatel> the basics are pretty easy.
[10:41:22] <decx> why wrap it again when you can this.value
[10:41:36] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel You rock! Really!!!
[10:41:42] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: in my case, the element is below the button so i am scrolling down…
[10:41:56] <duch_kazatel> decx huh?
[10:42:18] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric “scrolling to top” will take you down?
[10:42:33] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: the element is below the button
[10:42:33] <decx> $(this).val() is just this.value
[10:42:35] <Es0teric> its not at the top
[10:42:57] <duch_kazatel> decx i’m so used to always use .value()
[10:43:08] <duch_kazatel> *using
[10:43:24] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric then don’t call it “Scroll to top”.  “top” usually means the “the top of the page”
[10:43:31] <decx> i planted the seed of doubt already .value() eh :D
[10:43:39] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i know that
[10:43:40] <duch_kazatel> err, .val()
[10:44:02] <duch_kazatel> decx that’s a good question.  what’s the primary difference between the two.
[10:44:08] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: so then whats an alternative to animate a div being scrolled without using a 3rd party library?
[10:44:28] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you mean scrolling to a div?
[10:44:31] <decx> i dont think there's any functional difference
[10:44:34] <duch_kazatel> or moving the div in the screen?
[10:44:34] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: yes
[10:44:40] <Es0teric> scrolling to a div
[10:44:41] <decx> just the jq object wrapping
[10:46:04] <duch_kazatel> decx good point.  i wonder if there’s any functional difference other than that.
[10:46:47] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: ?
[10:46:57] <duch_kazatel> !jquery animate scroll to elements
[10:47:02] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery animate scroll to element
[10:47:03] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: scrollto - jQuery scroll To Element - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/jquery-scroll-to-element
[10:47:16] <duch_kazatel> first answer there duder.
[10:48:14] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: i am actually using that
[10:48:29] <Es0teric> the one with scrollTop offset().top
[10:48:33] <duch_kazatel> that doesn’t involve a plugin.
[10:48:41] <duch_kazatel> just the jquery library.
[10:51:42] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: that solution does not help because its still making the scrollbar act up when a user tries to scroll up
[10:52:03] <duch_kazatel> i was late to the party apparently.  do you have a fiddle?
[10:52:27] <decx> look who you are talkign to
[10:52:28] <decx> ^^
[10:52:32] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel Sorry to bug again, but how would I edit that so that it works before the on change? Reason is all the multiple filters start on "All" So when the value is All, I want the button to have the class
[10:52:37] <bradbrad> Hope that makes sense
[10:52:40] <decx> never time for a fiddle :>
[10:53:28] <Es0teric> i have a meeting in < 9mins… no time for a fiddle lol
[10:53:34] <aniasis> other than #requirejs where can I get require.js support on IRC?
[10:53:49] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric then you don’t have time to ask for help ;)
[10:53:51] <Es0teric> aniasis: try #web
[10:53:57] <duch_kazatel> bradbrad not making sense.
[10:53:58] <Edvard> hi again
[10:54:05] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel: my feature is complete… i am just testing right now
[10:54:06] <Es0teric> thats all
[10:54:17] <duch_kazatel> bradbrad you want to edit the class before the change happens?
[10:54:28] <duch_kazatel> add that class, rather?
[10:54:44] <bradbrad> yes
[10:54:52] <duch_kazatel> then add it in your html
[10:54:55] <duch_kazatel> don’t do that with JS
[10:55:38] <bradbrad> will be better because the class i want to add will hide it, and I only want it hidden on the default value, not the many other options
[10:56:21] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel look here, its for the filter here: http://new.eclecticaartandantiques.co.za
[10:56:54] <bradbrad> so the reset button will be hidden my default, untill the make they filter their results
[10:57:00] <duch_kazatel> bradbrad handle that in your backend logic, not your frontend logic.
[10:57:37] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel maybe better to say if the selection is not X, then add class?
[10:57:41] <bradbrad> would that not be better?
[10:58:10] <duch_kazatel> i’m confused about what you need, then.  are you talking about hiding it by default?
[11:01:17] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel yes. so the reset button will only display AFTER they have selected anything else besides the default selected value (which makes more sense as why would you reset something you haven;t filtered yet)
[11:01:45] <duch_kazatel> right - so add a hidden class and remove that when they’ve changed the dropdown.
[11:06:31] <bradbrad> duch_kazatel, thats what im saying, if selection is not X, then remove class. Just dont know how to go about it :(
[11:08:49] <decx> it's the same principle just change === to != and remove instead of ad
[11:08:51] <decx> d
[11:08:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah... kind of basic stuff.
[11:10:05] <bradbrad> :)
[11:21:51] <silverdust> I'm trying to check all the slave boxes when the master is checked here http://jsbin.com/cehaseti/1/edit
[11:22:04] <silverdust> and do vice-versa when the master is unchecked
[11:23:35] <decx> first of all dont use attr
[11:23:38] <decx> use prop
[11:24:08] <silverdust> decx: Just in this case or a general advice ?
[11:24:14] <decx> general advice
[11:26:19] <decx> here without a condition http://jsfiddle.net/decx/YWHH2/

[11:38:24] <Novocaine> Hi all, someone can help me on a script?
[11:39:09] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Novocaine
[11:39:14] <b-ot> Novocaine: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:42:24] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm looking for some guidance here. We're using some fancy HTML5 stuff to record a visitors voice as part of a song. After recording, there is a small form to fill out before submitting and uploading the form and audio file via AJAX to the server. How can I associate the recorded audio file (stored on client machine) with the serialized form data for submission?
[11:42:37] <Novocaine> Well, the thing is that i have 3 box that chage size when its clicked, when it's clicked i want to display a different div inside only on the clicked box (well http://jsfiddle.net/ZrxE7/ will be easier to understand)
[11:43:05] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:43:43] <duch_kazatel> first off - give them all a shared class and target that class for your css/animation.
[11:44:39] <duch_kazatel> second, if you want to target a thing that was clicked, check out the $(this) object inside that function.
[11:45:56] <Novocaine> duch_kazatel: i'm a bit new and not really confortable with it, try to learn, i try to use .hide / .show but can't find what i need to get it work

[11:58:35] <Guesticles> Is there anyway to display the message from jQuery.Validator somewhere besides directly behind the field?
[11:59:06] <aniasis> Does anyone know howto clear the globalDefinitionQueue in requirejs through the API?
[12:13:25] <jessica583> i'm using the 'jquery-validation' plugin but the text input fields are being marked with error messages even thought hey have valid input
[12:20:43] <djQuery_> jessica583, that's nice
[12:21:21] <djQuery_> aniasis, there is a way to have a validation summary
[12:22:38] <BillCriswell>  jessica583 Would need to see the code to help out with that. Can you replicate it in a fiddle?
[12:24:31] <BillCriswell> Damn, Eli Wallach died.
[12:26:02] <djQuery_> aniasis, http://formvalidator.net/#configuration  scroll down to "Positioning the error messages"
[12:26:26] <djQuery_> jessica583, or at least let us know how the field is defined.
[12:28:21] <Guesticles> djQuery_: Are you referring to me?
[12:28:52] <djQuery_> Guesticles, no I think I referenced the people I was directing the comments to
[12:30:04] <Guesticles> djQuery_: aniasis asked about clearing globalDefinitionQueue. I asked about positioning jQuery.validate messages....
[12:30:13] <Guesticles> djQuery_: aniasis asked about clearing globalDefinitionQueue. I asked about positioning jQuery.validate messages....
[12:32:09] <Velveeta> guesticles is one of the greatest names ever
[12:32:24] <Guesticles> Thanks Velveeta
[12:33:55] <BillCriswell> I don't get it... but it's kind of fun to say I guess.
[12:47:42] <Guesticles> BillCriswell: Because the irc client I used to use was "Guest#####", and I was trying to come up with a name, so I mixed "Guest" and "Testicles" to get "Guesticles"
[12:48:24] <BillCriswell> Haha I got that far.
[12:48:27] <thebope> lol
[12:48:41] <Xliff> Now how would that work? What? My testicles invite you over for dinner or something?
[12:48:45] <Xliff> NOT happening! :)
[12:48:55] <thebope> reminds me of the ol "If quizzes are quizzical what are tests?" joke
[12:50:14] <mrblinko> there testicles?
[12:51:08] <Xliff> thehope: But those would be testiCALS!
[12:52:05] <thebope> haha
[12:52:31] <thebope> testiCALS you and invites you over for dinner
[12:52:33] <thebope> ;-)
[12:53:11] <Xliff> thehope: D'oh! Well played, sir. WELL played! :)
[12:55:15] <thebope> hahaha :-)
[12:55:37] <thebope> thehope, that's funny, thats a better name than thebope
[12:55:42] <thebope> might register that
[12:56:34] <Xliff> LOL! I wasn't wearing my glasses.
[12:56:49] <Xliff> That one's free. If you want to use any more of my good ideas, they are going to cost you! :)
[12:56:58] <thehope> hahaha
[12:57:11] <thehope> its okay I have thehope it will be affordable
[12:57:22] <ChocoPants> booooooooo!
[12:57:26] <thehope> hahahaha
[12:57:51] <Xliff> ChocoPants: Did you know you aren't wearin' any pants?
[12:58:33] <ChocoPants> there molded
[12:58:49] <ChocoPants> I have a strange jquery question while im at it as well.
[12:58:53] <thehope> oh good
[12:59:22] <Xliff> Maybe it will get bopey hopey here a headache.
[12:59:23] <Xliff> :D
[12:59:23] <thehope> Let me resist the urge to make a bad thehope joke
[12:59:33] <ChocoPants> Im awful at explaining code lets see how this goes.
[12:59:34] <Xliff> Too late. Beat you to it.
[12:59:35] <ChocoPants> I WILL BOO IT AGAIN
[12:59:45] <thehope> hahaha
[12:59:48] <Xliff> Please do!
[12:59:57] <Xliff> ChocoPants: Please<fiddle> your code.
[13:00:00] <thehope> ChocoPants, yea fiddle
[13:00:05] <thehope> damnit Xliff
[13:00:12] <Xliff> =D
[13:00:15] <thehope> lol
[13:00:44] <ChocoPants> hahaha i might be able to explain without showing though gotta work on my prowess here!
[13:01:50] <ChocoPants> Im losing the ability to click anchor tags, when using replaceWith returned html from an ajax query to my django view.
[13:01:58] <ChocoPants> sufficient?! ENTERTAINED?!
[13:02:22] <thehope> have you checked the console for output on the developer tools?
[13:02:24] <ChocoPants> oh thank god that underscore was gone i was worried
[13:02:31] <Xliff> No. Please. No explanations without <fiddle>s
[13:02:39] <ChocoPants> k one sec
[13:05:17] <ChocoPants> ok i dont want to literally put the hundreds of lines im working on but this is basically what it comes down to http://jsfiddle.net/vx7Q9/
[13:05:50] <ChocoPants> When it successfully returns my page is updated, but all the hrefs that are shown become unclickable, it knows its an anchor tag but it just cant be clicked its strange
[13:06:50] <djQuery_> ChocoPants: well its putting it in there as plain text
[13:07:45] <djQuery_> ChocoPants: have you tried $("#Everything").html(returned_html);
[13:08:19] <djQuery_> ChocoPants: also data is going to have all the headers in there as well
[13:08:35] <Xliff> djQ!
[13:09:00] * djQuery_ facedesks Xliff
[13:09:26] <thehope> lol
[13:09:29] <Xliff> ChocoPants: This explains only so much. Do you set any events on <a> tags? Do you delegate instead of setting those events every time?
[13:09:30] <decx> facedesks, what a cool word
[13:09:41] <decx> i will start using that everyday
[13:09:42] * Xliff <headdesk />'s djQuery 
[13:09:52] <djQuery_> Xliff: sorry the image of coming up behind you and smaking the back of your head hard enough to make your head hit your desk just stick in my mind
[13:09:54] <Xliff> decx: Awww! What about mine!'
[13:10:28] <Xliff> djQuery: LOL! Pretty soon, my image will be replaced with yours and I. WILL.WIN!
[13:10:49] * decx uses subtlety, it's super effective
[13:11:23] <Xliff> ChocoPants: This code lacks a bit of context. Also, are you sure your response is sending well formed HTML?
[13:11:32] <ChocoPants> hahaha im sorry i went to the bathroom
[13:11:37] <decx> what do you mean you cant click the anchors
[13:11:40] <ChocoPants> so much has happened since I left
[13:11:44] <Xliff> decx: I start with the hard sell and then get more subtle as time goes on.
[13:11:55] <decx> do you just want default behaviour or do you have some handler on them
[13:12:00] <Xliff> ChocoPants: Bathroom? TMI dude! Move along!
[13:12:14] <Xliff> decx: I'm thinking handler issue here.
[13:12:16] <ChocoPants> default would be ideal
[13:12:40] <ChocoPants> I just want an anchor tag, to be a normal clickable, i have tried html compared to replacewith with the same results
[13:12:44] <Xliff> ChocoPants: Do you have a handler that does event.preventDefault() somewhere in your code?
[13:12:50] <decx> do you have any handler on anchors somewhere else?
[13:13:01] <ChocoPants> nope not on this page there is no preventdefault
[13:13:05] <thehope> ChocoPants, how much html are you sending in to it?
[13:13:23] <decx> did you inspect the area where you are clicking? maybe it'S a z-index issue
[13:13:34] <Edvard> what kind of storage can i use for creating a favourites list for mobile app?
[13:13:34] <ChocoPants> a good amount its using an ajax with django template to refresh a page without a full refresh
[13:13:37] <thehope> Have you tried just sending a set of anchor tags
[13:13:47] <thehope> and seen if its the anchor tags or if it is the rest of your html?
[13:13:56] <Xliff> decx: Better yet, is this code available on the internet where we can look at it and see exactly what is going on?
[13:14:05] <Xliff> s/decx/ChocoPants/
[13:15:04] <Xliff> Edvard: I don't understand the question.
[13:15:50] <Xliff> Edvard: I would expect you'd want that on the client. If so, how does this relate to #jQuery?
[13:15:54] <Edvard> i am creating a mobile app, for use offline. not sure of the exact title
[13:16:04] <ChocoPants> I dont have the code readily available with everything since its django view, jquery, and html.
[13:16:08] <Edvard> shit am in wrong channel lol
[13:16:15] <Edvard> sorry
[13:16:19] <djQuery_> Edvard: there are plenty of client side storage solutions if you are talking about an html app
[13:16:20] <ChocoPants> I could put it in fiddle for readability if that works but it wont be executable
[13:16:21] <Xliff> no worries. good luck!
[13:16:40] <Xliff> ChocoPants: Every little bit helps.
[13:16:46] <Edvard> html app yeah, just wondering what is recommened for mobile devices
[13:17:28] <djQuery_> Edvard: check this out http://jsbin.com/tipper/latest
[13:18:06] <djQuery_> Edvard: do a search for html localstorage
[13:18:52] <ChocoPants> ugh my hands are kind of tied from what i can show hold on.
[13:19:18] <djQuery_> ChocoPants: what is the datatype that is returned in the request
[13:20:14] <ChocoPants> render_to_response from django, with a template and serveral variables, the template is the rendering of the html which is passed to the success function of the ajax call
[13:21:09] <djQuery_> ChocoPants: not what I meant in the response header what is the datatype  text/html  somethign else?
[13:21:49] <L0j1k> fuck all of you. fuck jquery.
[13:21:56] <ChocoPants> hahahahahahahaha
[13:22:00] <ChocoPants> i like that guy
[13:22:01] <duch_kazatel> wel okay.
[13:22:01] <Xliff> ROFLMAO!
[13:22:09] <duch_kazatel> somebody is grumpy.
[13:22:23] <ChocoPants> i believe the return dtatype is html
[13:22:29] <thehope> hahahahaha
[13:22:34] <ChocoPants> text/html
[13:22:53] <ChocoPants> response*
[13:23:57] <duch_kazatel> http://www.l0j1k.com/ their site isn’t very good :(
[13:24:25] <thehope> you don't think so?
[13:24:29] <thehope> It seems okay
[13:24:47] <djQuery_> hurts my eyes
[13:24:54] <thehope> yea not the best colorschme
[13:24:58] <thehope> but besides that
[13:25:07] <thehope> I'd say the colorscheme goes well with the theme
[13:25:29] <ChocoPants> the theme of terrible
[13:26:41] <Xliff> The theme of: No. I disbelieve in progress. The future is terminals. TERMINALS!
[13:27:10] <Xliff> "Aloha and welcome. L0j1k is my name, technology is my game. In Master of Orion, I always play Psilon."
[13:27:18] <Xliff> ^ And can't rap worth a damn.

[13:27:33] <ChocoPants> hey hes in carlsbad, someone backtrace him ill beat him up
[13:28:06] <Xliff> djQuery: Ouch! Corrupted disk?

[13:33:42] <Xliff> djQuery: http://askubuntu.com/questions/11184/how-to-change-users-language-locale-back-to-english
[13:33:53] <Edvard> thanks
[13:34:00] <Edvard> searching now djQuery
[13:34:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hello. Try resizing the result window here: http://jsfiddle.net/n4FCt/ - why does it always log margin-left:0; ? and how do I retrieve the space between the green and red box?
[13:35:35] <decx> why do you expect it to return a margin if you never set one?
[13:35:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes, 0. So how to get the space inbetween?
[13:36:18] <Xliff> ecky--ptang-zoob: The left margen is relative to the document window. That will always be 0px because your CSS doesn't say otherwise.
[13:36:18] <decx> depends on what you want to use it for
[13:36:48] <Xliff> ecky--ptang-zoob: Which space? Horizontal or vertical?
[13:37:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> horizontal, between the left edges
[13:37:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Wait, let me make a realistic example
[13:38:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It works in Chrome, but not in firefox
[13:38:55] <djQuery_> yeah rooboot fixed it
[13:38:59] <Xliff> Nice.
[13:39:07] <Xliff> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://jsfiddle.net/n4FCt/3/
[13:39:34] <decx> if you set wrapper css to position: relative you can retrieve sections offset inside it with position()
[13:40:03] <decx> similar to that example but that will be relative to the body
[13:40:04] <Xliff> decx: Yup. Just what I did.
[13:40:07] <decx> no
[13:40:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah! sweet, thanks
[13:40:12] <decx> you missed the position: relative step
[13:40:18] <Xliff> Oh.
[13:40:22] <decx> what you did is like offset() relative to the document
[13:40:42] <Xliff> Ah! I always forget that bit.
[13:40:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Your thing isn't logging anytthing though
[13:41:04] <decx> note that it's 49,999 instead of 39,999 like it should
[13:41:48] <Xliff> Mine is logging here. Check console log for "section: "
[13:42:00] <Xliff> "section: 49px"
[13:42:46] <decx> also you should cache these selectors beforehand as the resize function is executed too often and you just repeatetly query for the same thing anew
[13:43:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> flawless
[13:43:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Been searching for an hour to get this
[13:44:05] <decx> 80% width container inside a wrapper with padding will give you headaches though
[13:44:16] <Xliff> Yup
[13:44:19] <decx> why not rely on the padding?
[13:44:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> actually it's margin: 0 auto, not 80% width
[13:45:00] <decx> also width & padding, do you use border-box?
[13:45:08] <decx> width 100% *
[13:46:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> of course IE does it wrong again, grrr
[13:46:31] <decx> so now the question is why bother getting position if the padding is a guaranteed 40px
[13:47:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx: no, this is a very simplified example. I'm using Isotope width masonry fit width, it automatically centers the content based of the amount of space, so the left and right margin vary constantly when you resize
[13:48:14] <decx> that data is probably already in your isotope object
[13:49:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> maybe...
[13:49:12] <ChocoPants> jquery is mean thats why
[13:51:25] <djQuery> ChocoPants, lol
[13:51:56] <ChocoPants> haha all i get with jquery is crazy errors I JUST WANT MY ANCHORS
[13:51:59] <ChocoPants> hahaha
[13:54:54] <djQuery> ChocoPants, link?
[13:55:04] <ChocoPants> weird alright so fancy jquery person question for you
[13:55:06] <djQuery> ChocoPants, jsbin is your friend
[13:56:56] <ChocoPants> one sec im fooling with jsfiddle
[13:59:37] <ChocoPants> alright look at the before and after in the html, thats what happens before and after my ajax call
[13:59:40] <ChocoPants> http://jsfiddle.net/Qg9cB/
[14:01:27] <djQuery> ChocoPants, not realy doint it for me
[14:01:32] <djQuery> ChocoPants, $("#Everything").empty().append(returned_html.find('a'));
[14:01:54] <decx> well fix your backend
[14:02:13] <djQuery> ChocoPants, or at least try console.log(returned_html);
[14:02:42] <djQuery> ChocoPants, I realy don't think it is seeing the return as text/html
[14:02:57] <decx> if /search/service returns faulty markup then you can jquery until you are blue in the face
[14:03:34] <ChocoPants> see search/service initally loads the page and its fine
[14:03:54] <decx> apparently not
[14:04:01] <ChocoPants> ok i logged taht return what element is necessary
[14:04:13] <ChocoPants> initally its perfect, however jquery breaks it on an ajax reload
[14:04:32] <djQuery> ChocoPants, spend a little time on the network tab of developer tools to see exactly what it is returning
[14:04:36] <ChocoPants> its like a dictionary with a million values
[14:06:18] <Xliff|NGNL> ChocoPants: Not really. Once you learn how to use it is immensely helpful.
[14:06:26] <Xliff|NGNL> The code in the fiddle won't work, though.
[14:06:48] <ChocoPants> yea i know that because i cant add the django aspect of it for the ajax call
[14:07:10] <decx> console.log(data) in the success function and paste that somewhere
[14:07:14] <djQuery> anyone know of something like jsbin\jsfiddle that allows multiple files and real time colabrative editing
[14:08:37] <ChocoPants> [script, text, script, text, script, text, script, text, style, text, link, text, link, text, div#Everything, jquery: "1.11.0", constructor: function, selector: "", toArray: function, get: function…] thats what the log returns as
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> djQuery jsfiddle does
[14:09:28] <ChocoPants> http://jsfiddle.net/Qg9cB/#&togetherjs=FSLvAIH6cj
[14:09:34] <ChocoPants> thats collaboration apparently
[14:09:51] <ChocoPants> thats awesome.
[14:09:52] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, jsfiddle is single file
[14:10:02] <duch_kazatel> oh like a full-on IDE?
[14:10:35] <djQuery> ChocoPants, heck when did they add that
[14:10:37] <decx> djQuery http://plnkr.co/
[14:10:42] <duch_kazatel> months ago.
[14:10:47] <ChocoPants> its so cooool
[14:16:38] <djQuery> decx, that one looks cool
[14:16:54] <Xliff|NGNL> plnkr does look cool.
[14:17:33] <decx> too slow for me, i just saw it earlier when somebody had a problem
[14:17:40] <djQuery> http://plnkr.co/edit/?p=streamer&s=amd3UXroJYRxP1hJ
[14:18:11] <Brasdf> hi
[14:18:21] <Brasdf> I'm using fullcalendar jquery plugin!
[14:18:33] <Brasdf> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/mouse/dayClick/
[14:18:54] <Brasdf> Here how can I set the format of date with this ::  date.format()
[14:22:31] <djQuery> Brasdf, date.format() is just pure javascript unrelated to the plugin
[14:23:13] <djQuery> Brasdf, just do a google on javascript date.format   its been said a billion times on the intertubes better than I could here
[14:27:22] <Brasdf> djQuery : thank you mn
[14:31:19] <Brasdf> I'm sorry but doesn't  works :: I have this dayClick: function(date, allDay, jsEvent, view){
[14:31:22] <Brasdf> ...
[14:31:40] <Brasdf> For example I need to show the date onclick day
[14:32:01] <Brasdf> alert(date);
[14:32:08] <Brasdf> and show the complete date
[14:32:11] <Brasdf> I just need to get the day
[14:33:11] <ChocoPants> ok so basically why would my ajax return a value outside of an anchor tag
[14:33:25] <ChocoPants> even though the return in html checked in the network in firebug returns properly
[14:33:33] <ChocoPants> and source shows it properly
[14:33:41] <duch_kazatel> can you share the returned data?
[14:34:03] <ChocoPants> its an entire html page, but the type is html/text
[14:34:10] <ChocoPants> honestly i think its just a 1 in a million bug
[14:34:42] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* can you share a data sample that is indicative of the issue you’re experiencing?
[14:34:43] <djQuery> ChocoPants, gl
[14:36:51] <djQuery> angular pretty popular now huh
[14:37:32] <systemfault> Yeah, probably the most popular MV* these days
[14:43:32] <Brasdf> djQuery : I believe this is a internal function of fullcalendar
[14:43:36] <Brasdf> can you help me?
[14:46:06] <duch_kazatel> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs1/utilities/formatDate/
[14:49:01] <Brasdf> like this :: alert($.fullCalendar.formatDate(date, ["d"]));
[14:49:01] <duch_kazatel> Brasdf ^ that link shows you what you need.
[14:49:02] <Brasdf> ?
[14:49:31] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[14:49:33] <duch_kazatel> no...
[14:49:37] <Brasdf> show me an error : format.charAt is not a function
[14:50:55] <Brasdf> I'm sorry
[14:51:02] <Brasdf> I'm not so good with js
[14:51:06] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Brasdf
[14:51:06] <b-ot> Brasdf: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:55:11] <Hyperking> how do i initalize a function win a click event
[14:55:32] <dave_3> hello need a little help
[14:56:01] <decx> what race is the function supposed to win?
[14:58:24] <djQuery> systemfault, pretty cool http://curran.github.io/screencasts/introToAngular/exampleViewer/#/7
[14:59:00] <Hyperking> my click even uses a .load() method but I need to re-initialize a function once it's loaded
[14:59:02] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, two-way bindings are cool… until you have too many of them, it makes your app super slow :/
[14:59:43] <djQuery> systemfault, whish they had used data-model instead of ng-model
[15:00:02] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking you want event delegation instead.
[15:00:27] <systemfault> djQuery: They do.
[15:00:47] <systemfault> djQuery: You can use ng-model or data-ng-model or x-ng-model IIRC
[15:00:48] <djQuery> systemfault, not in the demos I am looking at yet
[15:01:10] <djQuery> systemfault, cool
[15:03:28] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: not sure.
[15:03:42] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking are you re-binding a click event handler?
[15:04:19] <Hyperking> no, Im simply needing to initialize a chart function once the new data is loaded
[15:04:41] <duch_kazatel> okay, then check out the .done() callback off of .load()
[15:04:51] <djQuery> Hyperking, what chart plugin
[15:05:57] <Hyperking> djQuery: http://rendro.github.io/easy-pie-chart/
[15:12:25] <Hyperking> i notice .load() method doesn't load inline scripts..why?
[15:13:06] <duch_kazatel> to save you from doing something you probably don’t mean to do.
[15:15:05] <Hyperking> i mean to call initChart() after ajax. since the .done() method didn't work.
[15:19:14] <duch_kazatel> why doesn’t .done() work?
[15:19:18] <duch_kazatel> .load().done()
[15:19:31] <uskerine> I'll try it again: does anyone has used focusout with datatables.net plugin?
[15:21:37] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: not sure, im getting a  undefined is not a function
[15:22:13] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code?
[15:24:38] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/VZYzE/2/
[15:25:52] <uskerine> how do I say -select- "all input elements of class foo from table ID myFooTable"?
[15:27:42] <duch_kazatel> $(‘#myFooTable input.foo’)
[15:28:04] <uskerine> $('#myFooTable .foo')
[15:28:16] <uskerine> whould that be: all elements of class foo inside #myFooTable
[15:28:17] <uskerine> ?
[15:28:42] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:28:47] <duch_kazatel> just like with CSS>
[15:29:41] <uskerine> ok thanks
[15:35:42] <uskerine> can I have two .on events sentences for different events? like:$('#newInvoiceTable tbody').on('click', 'a.deleteRow', function() { .....  and   $('#newInvoiceTable .discountText').on( 'focusout', function () {  ?
[15:36:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:36:20] <duch_kazatel> i’m seeing two different handlers there.
[15:36:45] <uskerine> forget it, I already found the issue
[15:36:56] <uskerine> I was not including the second argument on the .on for focusout
[15:37:00] <uskerine> now it works
[15:37:14] <duch_kazatel> you don’t have to include that if you don’t want delegation btw.
[15:37:37] <uskerine> what is delegation?
[15:38:12] <duch_kazatel> for most events, like click, they bubble up through the document.  you can bind a delegated listener to a parent that triggers on these bubbled events.
[15:39:17] <uskerine> so it would like a "common" listener in upper  hierarchy
[15:39:20] <uskerine> ?
[15:39:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:39:39] <uskerine> I did not understand that then
[15:39:51] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by “common:
[15:40:12] <uskerine> anyway I have pending to read a proper book on JQuery and JS, so far I am playing it by ear
[15:40:27] <uskerine> like having a single handler/listener
[15:40:30] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:40:41] <duch_kazatel> you have one listener that waits for that event to bubble up.
[15:40:45] <uskerine> that will catach up all evetns triggered by  lower hierarchy items
[15:40:59] <duch_kazatel> *all events that match, yes
[15:41:04] <uskerine> ok understood
[15:41:23] <uskerine> in this case i am fine with the specific handler, i need different things depending on the specific cells. thanks
[15:41:51] <louism2wash> Hey guys, this might be kind of a broad question but is there a downside to creating your own jquery functions?  I've heard rumblings against it....
[15:42:07] <duch_kazatel> “your own jquery functions” ?
[15:42:10] <duch_kazatel> like plugins?
[15:42:18] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: yes
[15:42:28] <duch_kazatel> totally depends on the use case.
[15:43:11] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: I am just using them to set event listeners on dom objects
[15:43:21] <duch_kazatel> then that is a bad idea.
[15:43:27] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: why
[15:43:48] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what building a plugin actually does?
[15:44:58] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: It adds a function property to the jquery object
[15:45:18] <duch_kazatel> right, which then gets attached to every single jquery object you create after that.
[15:45:25] <duch_kazatel> which is not always a good thing.
[15:45:36] <duch_kazatel> if you’re just trying to set listeners, use .on().
[15:45:45] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: so it bloats the object?
[15:45:56] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[15:46:00] <__joshua___> louism2wash: its fine if its just for you and its modular thing that you can slot in.  the downside is polluting jq namespace (and who cares if its your own).  upside is its convenient to do $('sel').myplugin();
[15:46:23] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ i care when people pollute because of how many people are working on our project ;)
[15:46:49] <louism2wash> __joshua__: yeah, the syntax is awesome and it makes my javascript/jquery code really to test
[15:47:01] <duch_kazatel> whaaaa
[15:47:08] <duch_kazatel> what does that have to do with testing?
[15:48:40] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: when unit testing functions I can really easily just create a chunk of html and set a listener on a dom object using the plugin name rather than recreating it using the on() syntax
[15:48:53] <__joshua___> arguable myplugin($('sel')) is not different all at.  in fact the only different is imports/module management
[15:58:53] <frank_o> Does anyone know why it's impossible to click the `Open panel` button in jQuery Mobile when my custom SVG touch indicator is enabled (using Chrome's mobile emulation)? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/M5q34/embedded/result/
[16:15:38] <dokma> how da heck is this possible??? http://pastebin.com/17AfBCmc
[16:15:51] <duch_kazatel> is what possible?
[16:16:10] <dokma> did you read?
[16:16:36] <duch_kazatel> pretty hard to read the code as-is. formatting now.  what specifically are you asking about?
[16:16:53] <dokma> well the "circular structure" thing
[16:17:12] <dokma> when I invoke stringify on a return it gets TypeError
[16:17:22] <systemfault> dokma: Not sure it's going to fix it but try JSON.stringify(arr.get());
[16:17:26] <dokma> if I invoke stringify on an identical literal it's fine
[16:17:42] <dokma> let me see
[16:18:12] <dokma> yeah that works
[16:18:20] <systemfault> It's because it wasn't an array
[16:18:20] <dokma> can't tell what's the difference
[16:18:30] <systemfault> It was a jQuery collection which is "array-like"
[16:18:39] <systemfault> Using .get() returned a real array
[16:18:43] <dokma> I thought [0] got rid of that...
[16:19:19] <systemfault> Perhaps it's because you have 2 levels of .map
[16:19:33] <duch_kazatel> yo dawg
[16:19:39] <dokma> brutal...
[16:22:53] <Yahkob> Hey I'm not sure if this is a really dumb question but is there anyway I could append something to an external file
[16:23:06] <duch_kazatel> using a server, yes.
[16:23:12] <Yahkob> like append 'hello' from file foo to file bar
[16:23:33] <duch_kazatel> you cannot do that unless you have something running on the server that has the file.
[16:23:34] <Yahkob> Ah ok that makes sense heh this is something im doing with a server
[16:30:03] <banister> hey
[16:30:38] <banister> i'm messing around with jquery-ui 'dialog',   i want the dialog to appear only when a button is clicked. What's the idiomatic way to accomplish this? i see that i have to provide a div with content in it
[16:30:57] <duch_kazatel> by triggering it “programmatically”
[16:31:18] <duch_kazatel> check out .dialog(‘open’);
[16:34:50] <ornerymoose> I have a question on how to ‘keep the resulted state’ in js/jquery manipulation when using the browser back button: as in, when the page loads the initial drop down menu option should not be selectable (which occurs), but using the backbutton after adding an item to cart allows the initial drop down item to be selected (which is occurring, and not good): http://codeshare.io/yWUZd
[16:36:00] <banister> duch_kazatel: but, i have to store the content in a div before calling dialog() on it...how do i stop that content showing before the button (to reveal the dialog) is clicked?
[16:36:14] <duch_kazatel> banister huh?
[16:36:35] <__joshua___> onerymoose: that is a very open ended question
[16:36:57] <banister> duch_kazatel: <div id="dialog">MY CONTENT</div>          then in the js, $("#dialog").dialog()
[16:36:57] <duch_kazatel> ornerymoose by “resetting” the inputs on pageload.
[16:37:19] <ornerymoose> sorry i made the codeshare shorter to just show one item
[16:37:20] <banister> duch_kazatel:  how do i hide the div (with MY CONTENT) prior to generaing the dialog
[16:37:22] <__joshua___> you could use the history api, but you need to store application state somehow.  some frameworks use fragments in the url
[16:37:48] <duch_kazatel> banister you mean only show the dialog when you click a button?
[16:37:59] <banister> duch_kazatel: yeah
[16:38:13] <duch_kazatel> by using an event handler.  check out on()
[16:38:32] <ornerymoose> duch_k: but is it truly a ‘page load’ when youre using the backbutton?
[16:38:46] <duch_kazatel> ornerymoose should be.
[16:38:48] <banister> duch_kazatel: so in the handler i call $("#my-dialog").dialog()  ? or..?
[16:38:53] <ornerymoose> hm i see
[16:38:55] <duch_kazatel> $(‘button’).on(‘click’, function() { $("#dialog").dialog(‘open’) });
[16:39:03] <duch_kazatel> banister did you read the docs or google around at all?
[16:39:14] <ornerymoose> josh: ill check out the history api, thank you. This app is using the Ruby on Rails framework, fwiw.
[16:39:30] <duch_kazatel> ornerymoose are you using pustates as-is?
[16:40:02] <banister> duch_kazatel: but, my point is, the #dialog div will exist prior to turning it into a dialog (in the on click event), how do i hide it or keep it from showing until i'm ready to turn it into a dialog?
[16:40:16] <ornerymoose> duch: not sure what you mean?
[16:40:32] <duch_kazatel> ornerymoose if you’re not sure, then you probably aren’t :)
[16:40:50] <ornerymoose> haha, ok, fair enough :)
[16:41:01] <duch_kazatel> the history api won’t help you in that case.
[16:41:04] <ornerymoose> ill look into just resetting the drop down menus…cant be too hard i imagine
[16:41:09] <ornerymoose> ok, gotcha.
[16:41:38] <duch_kazatel> banister it’ll be hidden...
[16:42:06] <duch_kazatel> you init it earlier by using .dialog(), and then call the open on it in your click handler.
[16:42:28] <banister> duch_kazatel: but i have to init it with .dialog('close') so that it won't automatically open?
[16:42:34] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:42:39] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to just do .dialog()
[16:42:47] <banister> duch_kazatel:  cos just using dialog() causes it to open up and show on my screen
[16:43:10] <duch_kazatel> did you read the docs?
[16:43:42] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-autoOpen
[16:52:31] <ChocoPants> god how do you guys enjoy jquery it hurts my brain
[16:54:06] <systemfault> ChocoPants: It's the easiest DOM manipulation library… try pure DOM, you'll come back screaming.
[16:54:14] <tw2113> ChocoPants, imagine using just straight javascript
[16:55:14] <ChocoPants> true, STILL HATE IT BURN IT ALL
[16:57:01] <duch_kazatel> ChocoPants wut
[16:57:29] <systemfault> Lots of frustration on #jQuery today
[16:57:36] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[17:00:13] <tw2113> it's bound to happen some days
[17:00:38] <Jadenn> hey, i'm having issues with http://paste.arviksa.co.uk/kobexogapagiqejo - basically, when i first load the page, the pmwindow is in the off position, set as 0, and when i activate that toggle function i have to toggle it on, off and then on again before it runs line 17
[17:00:55] <Jadenn> i added a console.log() directly after 17, and it gets called everytime but it wont trigger the tab
[17:01:20] <Jadenn> until the second opening toggle rather
[17:03:46] <Stephen> Anyone here still using DurandalJS?
[17:04:16] <duch_kazatel> Jadenn how are you calling this?
[17:04:30] <Jadenn> via button, which calls the method
[17:04:44] <duch_kazatel> is it possible for you to create a functioning example?
[17:05:33] <Jadenn> you'll need to give me a few minutes to throw a fiddle together
[17:06:14] <duch_kazatel> just something simple - if you can ditch the cookie logic and the extra stuff not related to the toggle, that’d be ideal.
[17:14:35] <ChocoPants> man noone likes jquery irc everyones leaving
[17:14:47] <duch_kazatel> west coast.
[17:15:03] <ChocoPants> thats meeee
[17:15:08] <duch_kazatel> same here
[17:15:15] <duch_kazatel> folks getting off work.
[17:15:21] <ChocoPants> yea makes sense
[17:15:33] <ChocoPants> well im still at work figuring crap out wooo
[17:15:53] <duch_kazatel> i’m re-writing a major part of our site so we can get rid of mootools.
[17:16:30] <duch_kazatel> it’s like the last file for this part of the project, too.
[17:19:17] <Jadenn> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/6efmW/ apparently my function is not define. idk whats up with it
[17:20:02] <duch_kazatel> oh woah :(*
[17:20:09] <duch_kazatel>  onclick="disableChat();" is bad.
[17:20:57] <Jadenn> i'm not going to get into programming practice at this time >_> its highly experimental software
[17:20:58] <duch_kazatel> start by not using inline event handlers.
[17:21:04] <duch_kazatel> this is jquery 101
[17:21:16] <duch_kazatel> doesn’t matter that it’s experimental.
[17:21:23] <duch_kazatel> use .on() to bind listeners.
[17:21:39] <duch_kazatel> I can’t replicate the issue here either way.
[17:22:10] <duch_kazatel> ah, now I can, and it works fine,.
[17:24:04] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6efmW/3/
[17:24:09] <Jadenn> http://jsfiddle.net/6efmW/2/ happy? :P
[17:24:16] <Jadenn> i need to eat dinner , i'll be back
[17:24:29] <duch_kazatel> i can’t reproduce your bug, either way.
[17:56:24] <ulik> Why doesn't the jquery on work? http://jsfiddle.net/59Af3/
[17:56:53] <duch_kazatel> works for me.
[17:57:02] <duch_kazatel> unless you mean why the second one doesn’t work.
[17:57:12] <ulik> if i remove anything that was added dynamically it doesn't work
[17:57:19] <duch_kazatel> oh, you want event delegation.
[17:57:26] <duch_kazatel> check out the delegated version of .on()
[17:58:13] <duch_kazatel> so instead of $(".email-entries .email-remove").on('click',function(e) { you’ll have $(".email-entries").on('click', '.email-remove', function(e) {
[17:58:19] <ulik> aah
[17:59:24] <ulik> thank you
[17:59:32] <duch_kazatel> can’t bind to what isn’t on the page, basically.
[18:30:26] <checkit> Hey all. I'm here because I am in some serious need for professional assistance. I'm writing an application that lets visitors record and upload their voice as part of the song. After recording, they fill out a simple form and I'm trying to append the audio file to an audio field in the form to be uploaded. How can I do this? This is a bite size portion of the code I'm working with: http://jsfiddle.net/7bFr7/
[18:33:38] <jquerious> hello
[18:33:50] <jquerious> How do I form an array of jquery objects in javascript?
[18:34:08] <jquerious> [$('test1'), $('test2')]     <-- will that work?
[18:35:17] <jquerious> basically, I have a function in javascript that I want to pass a few jquery objects into. so i'd like to use an array
[18:35:30] <jquerious> but when i try passing [$('test1'), $('test2')]  into the function it doesn't work
[18:35:35] <jquerious> items.length returns 0
[19:28:58] <aFeijo> hi folks. weird question. in this site http://fg.mindcore.me how to make the image unaffected by the mouse hover over the links?
[19:34:55] <negletios> this is not a jquery thing
[19:34:57] <negletios> is on the css
[19:35:33] <negletios> on your css find the: body #page-home #links a:hover
[19:36:04] <negletios> and remove the background property that it is inside. Which in your case is background : none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)
[19:50:22] <checkit> Guys I really need some help getting a recorded audio WAV file to post with form inputs... My form inputs are all present but I can't seem to append the audio file.. Anyone with experience here?
[20:15:01] <aFeijo> hi folks. weird question. in this site http://fg.mindcore.me how to make the image unaffected by the mouse hover over the links?
[20:16:49] <tw2113> how is the image being affected now?
[20:39:41] <lanister> anyone available to help me please? i have a very small issue getting a leaflet map to pan to a location. http://plnkr.co/edit/wNBfEwovQkTrlR548XcG?p=preview
[20:41:46] <lanister> sorry updated plnker http://plnkr.co/edit/DD2MxCwiQnCLvbNZEnVU?p=preview
[20:48:34] <Velveeta> lanister: Uncaught Error: Invalid LatLng object: (34.09313, -81.15756, undefined)
[20:49:38] <lanister> velveeta: right, i see that, not sure why its flagging the data. pasting int the values work..not sure whats wrong
[20:49:59] <Velveeta> what do you mean pasting in the values works?
[20:50:26] <AzMoo> Hi guys. Is there anything wrong with this? http://dpaste.com/3AWYSHZ When I call json_post it tells me it's undefined.
[20:50:47] <Velveeta> looking at the leaflet api, that constructor function is expecting 2 number types to be passed to it.. you're trying to pass 1 string to it instead..
[20:51:10] <Velveeta> azmoo: how are you trying to call json_post?
[20:52:05] <AzMoo> Velveeta: $(document).ready(function(){ $.json_post('myurl', {...}); });
[20:52:35] <Velveeta> azmoo: you're putting that function in the $.fn namespace, not $.. $.fn is used for running functions on collections of objects, like $('div').json_post()
[20:53:00] <Velveeta> if you want to just execute it standalone, as in $.json_post, then you need to assign it as $.json_post = function (etc), vs $.fn.json_post
[20:53:11] <AzMoo> Ooh, that makes a lot more sense. thanks.
[20:53:15] <Velveeta> azmoo: i'll whip you up an example of what you need to do to parse that, according to the leaflet docs
[20:53:19] <Velveeta> azmoo: no problemo
[20:54:20] <lanister> Velveeta:ok, your right..testing it now...should i create another data attribute or does jquery have a way of converting the string into an array?
[20:54:40] <Velveeta> you can just use native js to convert the string to an array with .split()
[20:55:27] <Velveeta> lanister: here's an example: http://plnkr.co/edit/K7xk5kTVNmP6mL6ovqk8?p=preview
[20:55:47] <Velveeta> one problem with that one is that it works for dutchman blvd, but not for wilson blvd, because you're storing the data inconsistently
[20:55:51] <karamazov> I've got a mobile navigation (using Foundation) and on the ipad if you go to a page via the navigation and then press back you return to the page with the navigation still open. Anyone experience something similar with ipads?
[20:56:14] <Velveeta> in one case, it's "-31.2345, -81.2345" and in the other it's "(-31.2345, -81.2345)"
[20:57:29] <lanister> right, i can fix that much...wasn't thinking in terms of the data-attribute being a string
[20:57:41] <jphase> karamazov: I use Foundation often and never run into that issue :\
[20:58:21] <karamazov> jphase: This is a first for me too. It's odd...I've added an onload function that removes the .expanded class but the ipad still opens the navigation when the user presses back.
[20:58:29] <Velveeta> lanister: data attributes (through the jquery .data() function) will actually coerce into whatever data type it best guesses them to be... if you store them as separate values, like data-latitude and data-longitude, with just a number in each, .data() will return them as a number
[20:58:42] <Velveeta> but combined the way they are, the comma tells data that it should be coerced into a string type
[20:59:17] <jphase> karamazov: hmm, yeah you shouldn't need to do any removeClass stuff, check all your $(document).foundation(); stuff and any other requirements and make sure they're in the right order
[20:59:45] <karamazov> jphase: Should foundation be added at the end?
[21:00:52] <lanister> velvetta: really, wouldn't the encapsulated ".." indicate a string value?
[21:01:07] <jphase> karamazov: check their docs, I think in their Javascript section
[21:01:14] <Velveeta> what .. ?
[21:01:23] <karamazov> jphase: Appreciate the input
[21:01:25] <jphase> karamazov: I'll check a site that I just did to be sure
[21:01:34] <Velveeta> there's a single dot in each value...
[21:02:14] <karamazov> jphase: That'd be great. The scenario is using the mobile nav to change pages, hitting the back button, and then the page loading with the nav opened (just to be more clear)
[21:02:14] <amh345> whats the best way to make sure if one form field is filled out, that certain other fields must be filled as well?  i've got a form here with 7 fields.  but only 5 need to be filled out. but i only need to make sure those 5 are filled if any single one of the five have a value.  does that make sense?
[21:02:31] <jphase> karamazov: I have jQuery first, foundation.min.js second, the rest of my js, and then literally after everything (last thing before </body>) I have    <script>jQuery(document).foundation();</script>
[21:03:16] <amh345> i also can't add anything to the html. so it has to al be in jquery.
[21:03:39] <lanister> Velvetta: thanks for your help, saved me some headache. still fresh using jquery and javascript
[21:03:51] <Velveeta> lanister: Velveeta* .. and you're welcome :)
[21:04:15] <amh345> I'm trying to figure out a way to have a list of the 5 form fields. and then loop through them all and see if one has a value. and if it does have a value, to also make sure the remaining 4 do as well.
[21:04:49] <Velveeta> amh345: there's no *simple* way to do it, per se, but you can do it with a function you use as a blur handler on all 5 of them, to check if any have a nonempty value, and add a required attribute to them all if any one does, and if none do, remove the required attribute from them all, and during form submit, check for any required fields and make sure they have values
[21:07:54] <amh345> Velveeta: i think i see what you're saying. I'm going to try it out now.  thank you.
[21:08:13] <Velveeta> i'm whipping up a jsfiddle demo to demonstrate it
[21:08:39] <amh345> oh, thank you!
[21:08:54] <amh345> the one thing is, it's not actually on a  submit. but on a shipping/billing toggle.
[21:09:23] <amh345> i need to make sure they don't enter in half a shipping address and leave the rest and then click back to billing information.
[21:09:54] <Velveeta> well, whatever the relevant event is, you can check for require field validation at that time
[21:10:02] <amh345> need to throw a simple alert or something, i suppose.
[21:10:06] <amh345> yes.
[21:13:51] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm looking for some guidance. Our visitors are recording there voice as part of a song with some nifty HTML5/jQuery stuff. Afterwards there is a short form they need to fill out before submitting via AJAX. I'm having a hard time attaching/appending the audio file to the post. Any thoughts?
[21:14:07] <karamazov> Whoa - is it standard for the ipad to always have the mobile navigation where you left it when you press back?
[21:15:37] <amh345> checkit: i've never done anything like that before.  is the file local or serverside?
[21:15:52] <checkit> amh345: The file is client side.
[21:16:26] <amh345> and you're just trying to do a multipart submit?
[21:16:56] <checkit> XMLHttpRequest
[21:17:00] <checkit> POST
[21:19:55] <Velveeta> amh345: ok, here's a sample implementation.. it's a little ugly, but i was in a rush to get to bed :D http://jsfiddle.net/g2Q6d/
[21:20:16] <Velveeta> that only shows the setting and unsetting of the required properties on those 5 inputs, not the check for validating them
[21:20:58] <Velveeta> but to validate them, you'd just do a search for $(':input[required]') and iterate over them to make sure they had nonempty values
[21:21:23] <Velveeta> if none of them are in a required state, it'll just be an empty collection and should pass validation
[21:21:51] <amh345> Velveeta: thank you so much.  one quick (i think) question.  right now you're using field + i since the field names are 1,2,3,4,5 etc.
[21:21:58] <Velveeta> right
[21:22:15] <Velveeta> that was just for brevity.. you'd probably want to be more explicit
[21:22:36] <Velveeta> like View.firstName = $('#firstName'); View.lastName = $('#lastName'); etc
[21:22:37] <amh345> is there a way to use a different field naming convention and have it check against that?
[21:22:51] <Velveeta> yeah, you just have to enter those names manually
[21:23:02] <amh345> ah yes. that's what i have. customer_shipping_first_name, customer_shipping_last_name and so on.
[21:23:05] <Velveeta> i named them the way i did so i could just throw it into a loop to crank it out faster
[21:23:09] <Velveeta> rightio
[21:23:47] <Velveeta> and the css was just to highlight whenever they toggled into a required state and when they toggled out of it, based on that blur function handler
[21:27:01] <Velveeta> ok i'm out for tonight, adios
[21:30:38] <amh345> Velveeta: i think i got it.  thanks man!
[21:31:42] <blox> Hi folks, I'm having a problem with JQuery that I think may be a bug in jquery-2.1.1. On line 349, it sets length = obj.length. Unfortunately that throws up an error because obj.len is undefined.
[21:31:48] <karamazov> jphase: I figured it out - safari mobile doesn't refresh the page when the back button is selected. Have to check the page status and call a reload if it's a cache.
[21:32:10] <jphase> oh, weird
[22:01:45] <KevinM> My load event on an img is being called before the image is actually loaded. Any ideas? http://pastie.org/private/1c4ejs8o3txtpeywvlp3zq
[22:02:51] <prtksxna> KevinM: Is this happening even when you set it to check only one image – #id_of_image instead of .class_of_images?
[22:03:57] <KevinM> Yes
[22:04:02] <KevinM> prtksxna: Yes
[22:05:17] <KevinM> It must have something to do with the way the file is being loaded, through a data protocol
[22:16:35] <KevinM> looks to be a Chrome-only occurrence, for better or for worse.
[22:22:28] <KevinM> and yet it works in Chrome 35. That's what I get for using Chrome 37..
[22:27:27] <tw2113> i get that at times with Firefox Aurora
[22:27:38] <tw2113> if anything, check and see if it happens in the latest stable
[22:27:45] <tw2113> if you're good there, then rejoice
[22:29:01] <KevinM> tw2113: Luckily I am
[22:29:34] <KevinM> that it works on stable, that is
[22:31:25] <bradbrad> Guys if you look here http://new.eclecticaartandantiques.co.za/fine-art I have a filter with this bit of javascript http://pastebin.com/bZwPCzg3 used to add a hide class to the reset button UNTILL a selection is made (in other words if the selected value is All, it ads the class to hide it). This works great if I filter the category, but if I filter by artist or any other select list it doesnt work!!! What am I doing wrong?
[22:51:31] <trustyhank> python guy here, trying to add feature to web app but after googling around am not sure sure where to start.  i have bot that mines twitter data, id like a div to display a recently commited tweet, maybe updating every 5 seconds or so. ive done a little jquery but no idea where to start
[22:53:08] <KevinM> bradbrad: try this http://pastebin.com/bqnN01k9
[22:56:18] <KevinM> trustyhank: a few ways you could go about that, first that comes to mind is have a jQuery ajax call that runs every 5 seconds and pulls JSON from your python script
[22:57:15] <trustyhank> KevinM: thank you! that sounds perfect
[22:57:16] <KevinM> decodes the JSON and then puts the HTML in the div. Or, even simpler (but kinda bad), have the Python script return the HTML and have the JavaScript just inject the HTML in the page
[22:58:29] <KevinM> You could even do a websockets / pull approach but that's less compatible(iirc) and a little more effort.
[23:00:21] <trustyhank> KevinM: yeah that sounds like maybe iteration 2 lol.  the ajax automatically calling my python script sounds perfect
[23:00:25] <KevinM> window.setInterval(function() { $.get("url", function(data) { $("#urdiv").html(data); }, 5000);
[23:00:37] <KevinM> That's how easy the HTML approach os
[23:00:38] <KevinM> *is
[23:01:00] <KevinM> No idea if that will work, that's just from memory
[23:01:29] <trustyhank> what is the difference between that and the first approach exactly?
[23:01:33] <trustyhank> does the page reload?
[23:01:35] <KevinM> JSON vs HTML?
[23:01:45] <trustyhank> oh nm, i see now
[23:02:30] <KevinM> JSON is better in every way (it's like an actual API) whereas the HTML is super easy but means that your backend scripts needs to know about how your frontend works
[23:03:51] <trustyhank> the python function already returns json lol, in this case being lazy is right!
[23:03:56] <KevinM> Forgot some closing brackets, here window.setInterval(function() { $.get("url", function(data) { $("#urdiv").html(data); }); }, 5000);
[23:04:58] <KevinM> the json way would be to extract the info from "data" and then insert it into the page dynamically. Creating html elements dynamically or replacing the contents of elements that already exist.
[23:06:14] <trustyhank> so i could insert the data into an empty div that already has style set in css?
[23:06:36] <djQuery> trustyhank, if it is just json data then NO
[23:06:49] <trustyhank> well, assuming i parse it
[23:06:58] <djQuery> then sure
[23:07:15] <KevinM> as long as you create the DOM elements dynamically, the tags won't appear out of nowhere
[23:07:22] <djQuery> trustyhank, might want to look at a template engine if your doing a lot of this
[23:08:22] <trustyhank> djQuery: im using jinja2 / flask, is jinja2 a template engine?
[23:08:55] <djQuery> trustyhank, not familar with that one
[23:09:00] <trustyhank> djQuery: im making templates with it at least : P sorry for dumb questions, im a new coder
[23:09:29] <djQuery> http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/templating-engines-9134396
[23:09:46] <djQuery> trustyhank, gotta start somewhere
[23:09:52] <djQuery> I typicaly start with google
[23:10:37] <djQuery> trustyhank, codeschool has a lotta interactive tuts
[23:11:15] <trustyhank> djQuery: ah i'll have to try those! i did the ones on codecademy, i think another approach could help it sink in
[23:21:26] <sammych> okay, need some solid advice from the gurus here: eval() to parse JSON from webservices on a server
[23:21:39] <djQuery> sammych, NO
[23:21:58] <djQuery> evil()
[23:22:03] <sammych> just needed the second opinion
[23:22:17] <sammych> I'm just about to tell people to replace their eval with JSON.parse()
[23:22:36] <sammych> how about a side question
[23:22:47] <djQuery> is there any user entered data in this json?
[23:23:05] <djQuery> sammych, ^^
[23:23:25] <sammych> it's a webservice call that itself has a bunch of data from user sources
[23:23:39] <djQuery> then very evil
[23:23:42] <sammych> it's data from an entirely other system
[23:23:51] <djQuery> who knows what crap is in that
[23:24:12] <sammych> the secondary question: is eval() faster than JSON.parse()?
[23:24:26] <sammych> it's a JS implementation of JSON.parse()
[23:24:32] <sammych> not native, in other words
[23:25:00] <djQuery> ?jsperf@ sammych
[23:25:11] <sammych> figures :p
[23:25:23] <djQuery> havent ever compared them myself
[23:25:37] <sammych> are you a JS guru?
[23:25:52] <djQuery> http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-parseasdf
[23:26:01] <djQuery> no I am the google ninja
[23:26:20] <sammych> JSON.parseasdf is not a function
[23:26:26] * sammych is kidding
[23:27:42] <djQuery> http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-parsejson
[23:28:23] <djQuery> sammych, looks close enough not to matter but yes evil() is faster
[23:29:07] <sammych> they're pretty much the same here
[23:29:10] <djQuery> no sorry was reading the graph backwards
[23:29:13] <djQuery> eval is faster
[23:29:27] <sammych> $.parse is faster on mine, but barely
[23:30:10] <djQuery> when doing a json request in jquery I havent ever had to do either
[23:30:59] <sammych> the jQuery implementation of the parser is much shorter than crockfords
[23:31:30] <sammych> oh wait
[23:31:33] <sammych> I should read the code
[23:32:39] <vinex08> yoh! my script conflicts with my wordpress theme fucntionality.. what can i add into my script?
[23:32:56] <timgauthier> remove the wordpress :P
[23:33:02] <timgauthier> i'm not helpyful ;)
[23:33:40] <sammych> $.noconflict?
[23:33:54] <djQuery> timgauthier, ++
[23:34:58] <djQuery> vinex08, is it your script or jquery that you are having a problem with
[23:35:19] <djQuery> doesnt wordpress allready come with a version of jquery?
[23:35:55] <slax0r> timgauthier: solution to most problems ;)
