[12:30:27] <personx> https://repl.it/@drowsyPepper/yo  I want to delete all other dynamic entries with the delete button on right, but not the first entry because it is necessary to have at least one qualification. the first table has ckass "qalf" which is cloned idynamically into a table with classname "qalf2" .now, how I can delete all the other dynamic rows from the 'delete' button  at right [inside class 'qalf2' but never delete the original 'qafl' table?

[19:58:22] <YourMCGeek> Hi there! I'm trying to use jQuery inside of my Javascript file for my HTML project. I've added the CDN script to my <head> tags, but $ is still not being defined. I can paste my code if you'd like. How can I resolve this?
