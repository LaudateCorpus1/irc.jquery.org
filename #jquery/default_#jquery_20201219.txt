[11:35:32] <alexkalopsia> hi everyone, I have a div with a specific class, and I am calling slideToggle via js to hide it. The issue is that for some reason the display:none gets aplied, but the div is still visible. Do you know if there is a way to make sure slideToggle adds !important?
[11:38:02] <alexkalopsia> for what I understand, it's overwritten by .d-md-block { display: block !important;}
