[01:18:41] <errorous> why not? $75 per hour, 10 hours overnight work, I estimated 16hrs alltogether, nice one for one nighter :)
[01:19:42] <robertmaxrees> hah, sure ;)
[01:19:57] <robertmaxrees> nothing wrong with that.
[10:13:52] <IHasFingers> let $a = [];$a.push(2);console.log($a.indexOf(2) >= 0); the log shows true and then undefine
[11:18:48] <shoky> IHasFingers: undefined is the return value from console.log(...)
[11:21:17] <IHasFingers> shoky, hi, if i do  let $a = [];$a.push(2); if($a.indexOf(2) >= 0) { alert(1)} this doesnt work
[11:21:30] <IHasFingers> no alert
[11:23:43] <shoky> IHasFingers: is working for me..
[11:25:00] <IHasFingers> works if i run it in console but not in my script
[11:26:01] <IHasFingers> shoky, let $a = [];$a.push("2"); if($a.indexOf(2) >= 0) { alert(1)} it actually string of 2
[11:26:44] <IHasFingers> is it possible so it doesnt case if it string or integer?
[11:26:47] <shoky> IHasFingers:  well, 2 is not "2"
[11:27:05] <shoky> .indexOf("2")  ?
[11:27:44] <shoky> IHasFingers: sorry, that wont work either
[11:28:31] <shoky> IHasFingers: $a.includes('2')
[11:47:27] <IHasFingers> shoky, the value of 2 is actually from $(this).val()
[11:47:46] <IHasFingers> it might not be a 2 always
[11:51:17] <shoky> dont know what logic you want to run then.. so you dont want to check if it includes '2' ..?
[11:52:34] <IHasFingers> just need it to be == and not ===
[11:52:40] <IHasFingers> if that makes sense?
[11:52:58] <IHasFingers> i meant have to loop and forget about using included
[11:56:35] <shoky> you could do  $a.find(item => item == '2')
[11:56:49] <shoky> or..  if($a.includes('2') || $a.includes(2))
[11:57:04] <shoky> though i dont see why you need to check for both string or number
[11:57:12] <shoky> .val() will only return one of them
[12:03:12] <IHasFingers> shoky, the method i am using this on
[12:03:28] <IHasFingers> should always check and it not always going to be 2
[12:03:34] <IHasFingers> has .val can be anything
[12:50:47] <jak2020> hi all
[12:51:45] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:52:12] <jak2020> i have this: <img class="img-responsive image-container clImg" src="data:image/jpg;base64, zVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOUAAAEACAIAAADDVSbEAACAAElEQVR42sy9d1gTaRv27T/f........................   my question is when user click on class: clImg    how to extract the base64? (the data)?
[12:52:27] <jak2020> robertmaxrees......
[12:52:30] <robertmaxrees> .... ?
[12:52:33] <robertmaxrees> it's the src property.
[12:52:35] <robertmaxrees> so just grab that.
[12:52:38] <jak2020> yes
[12:53:33] <jak2020> see: i have displayed a image base64, when user click on it, open a new webpage https://jsfiddle.net/e50293wp/  see please   in Chrome not Work(open a blank page), but in Firefox yes, why? how to fix?
[12:53:47] <jak2020> reading i have this problem: https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/682/what-does-the-not-allowed-to-navigate-top-frame-to-data-url-javascript-exception-means-in-google-chrome
[12:53:59] <robertmaxrees> head to #html and ask there.
[12:54:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:54:34] <jak2020> ok
[12:54:35] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, just use regular images - you don't habe to base64 encode them.
[12:54:56] <jak2020> ok, but i need fix it
[12:55:01] <jak2020> then
[12:55:20] <jak2020> how to extract the data form here: <img class="img-responsive image-container clImg" src="data:image/jpg;base64, zVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOUAAAEACAIAAADDVSbEAACAAElEQVR42sy9d1gTaRv27T/f........................  ?
[12:55:37] <robertmaxrees> i just told you how.
[12:55:49] <jak2020> src property
[12:55:50] <jak2020> ok
[12:56:06] <robertmaxrees> but that's not really what you're asking.
[12:56:15] <jak2020> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19937162/jquery-get-the-image-src
[12:56:17] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just host these as normal images?
[12:56:44] <jak2020> yes the images is stored as normal
[12:56:55] <jak2020> but the Server programming return base64
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> so i'll ask agai - why can't you host these as normal images?  instead of returning base64
[13:00:12] <robertmaxrees> ?? it seems like you have these arbitrary limitations and keep trying to solve a problem without really defining the problem in the first place.  if you hosted the images normally, you'd be done by now.  alternatively, load the image into a modal.  or do any of 1000 other things.
[13:03:39] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:04:37] <jak2020> other thing is load a modal....
[13:04:39] <jak2020> like me
[13:04:56] <jak2020> when user click on it how to show more big?
[13:05:28] <robertmaxrees> it may or may not be worth it to show it any bigger if the resolution is too low.
[13:05:30] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you can do that.
[13:09:37] <jak2020> i can return normal image
[13:09:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:10:01] <jak2020> a link similar to
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean you can load the image via a url instead?
[13:10:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of as a base64 encoded image, i mean
[13:21:22] <jak2020> ahhh i know....
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> ??
[13:24:55] <jak2020> see the scenario: i display in this window: https://postimg.cc/bD9BVdQr    When user click on button: "ver Fotos"   the system, go to a directory: /var/www/html/swItsol/AFC/ACTFIJO/2/   extract a list of images.... and return as a base64 .... if the directory have 100 images return 100 times base 64
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> so confused.
[13:26:57] <jak2020> with?
[13:27:32] <jak2020> ok removed base64
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> all of it.  screenshots never really help.  been a few years of this.  just don't really get why everything needs to be so overcomplicated.
[13:28:44] <jak2020> ok
[13:32:00] <jak2020> rmoved base 64:  now i have: <div class="col-lg-1"> <img src="http://192.168.10.250/swItsol/AFC/ACTFIJO/2/Mangas Mexico.jpg"> </div>
[13:32:43] <robertmaxrees> <div class="col-lg-1"><a href="http://192.168.10.250/swItsol/AFC/ACTFIJO/2/Mangas Mexico.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://192.168.10.250/swItsol/AFC/ACTFIJO/2/Mangas Mexico.jpg"></a></div>
[13:32:49] <robertmaxrees> done.  yw.
