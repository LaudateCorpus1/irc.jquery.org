[08:21:26] <javlens_> I need a way to plot a large bitmap image file from coordinates and then allow for onscreen editing and saving of the modified bitmap back to a plot file. I am not sure if a jquery library would solve this or if a combination of tools is needed for optimal speed and versatility (I also need to be able to add data to individual points, such as color and other properties)
[08:45:54] <FilipNortic> javlens: can't see why a jQuery lib would be better than a pure js one in this case. jQuery is mostly about selecting elements and modifying them consicely. (Back in the day syntax differneces between browsers was a big thing to  )
[08:46:24] <FilipNortic> That said there might be good jQuery plugins for your use case but you have to check for your requirements
[08:57:03] <javlens> FilipNortic: I think I should admit that on a scale of 1-10 in JS knowledge, I'm in the lower half, so while I can load a json array from a file, I'm not sure how to plot it
[08:57:20] <javlens> I was also not sure if I needed a combination of HTML5 canvas or other tools
[08:57:50] <javlens> so I'm really hoping for some good pointers and refs to get me started
[08:58:19] <javlens> so far I found the plotly.js library but it seems to be more of a graph point library, although I could be missing it's value
[08:59:58] <FilipNortic> well if you that and the json file in a jsFiddle someone here or in the ordinary js room might be willing to take a look at your use case
[09:07:26] <javlens> FilipNortic: I am just getting started, don't know what it the fastest load/save process for something like this so I was hoping for advice before I set sail in the wrong direction and lost too much time
[09:07:45] <javlens> I'm actually doing research for a company that neds this and need to give them some kind of answers soon
[09:09:59] <FilipNortic> well without looking at something there really isn't much I can say. Canvas is browser native so it is often faster then completly js based plotting engines.
[09:10:11] <FilipNortic> But it's a bit harder to work with
[10:00:57] <javlens> FilipNortic: I'm not sure if this is enough to start with, but here's a json string I whipped up real fast:  https://jsfiddle.net/tqhh1mgb/
[10:51:35] <FilipNortic> javlens: Well i have no idea what kind of plot you wanna make from that. You will have to do some kind of data extraction. and then plot that
[10:54:21] <javlens> FilipNortic: I essentially want to take the x/y coordinates and plot a pixel with the specified color. 5 million pixels later, you have an image. It's already being done in a dos app, but they want a browser app to do the same
[10:56:48] <FilipNortic> javlens: In that case I think using canvas i the best option
[11:00:58] <JrWebDev> if i copy and paste this code directly it only works once...its not listening after other changes...not sure how i should "chain" this to the event of when someone choose a file and its more than 0kb etc.
[11:01:00] <JrWebDev> https://pastebin.com/HUt4PfBX
[11:02:08] <Uhkis_> not a single listener in that paste
[11:02:12] <JrWebDev> the code basically says if the 'Choose file' is empty then disable the button that uploads files...if there 'choose file' has a file in it then you can enable the button again so that the user can upload whatever is in there
[11:02:20] <JrWebDev> i know how do i put the proper listener
[11:02:44] <JrWebDev> what would be the proper listener in my situation
[11:03:05] <Uhkis> $(ourinput).on('change', function() { code here });
[11:03:29] <JrWebDev> ok let me check
[11:06:37] <JrWebDev> perfect Uhkis thanks
[11:19:29] <javlens> FilipNortic: ok thanks for the input
[11:42:27] <MacroMan> Has there been any recent movement on allowing a blob dataType in $.ajax?
[11:42:43] <MacroMan> Searching brings up old posts from 2010 and 2013
[11:51:09] <RenokK> @MacroMan: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18254775/5986313
[11:51:33] <RenokK> Will this work for you? Worked for me a few month ago when i needed to send blob data.
[12:01:26] <MacroMan> I don't have any particular problem in mind at the moment, I was just curious if there was any movement with such a feature.
[12:02:06] <duch_kazatel> i missed the original question - what's going on?
[12:02:06] <MacroMan> I have needed it in the past and I'll need it again soon. I actually need to download a blob over ajax, so that work around won't work for me.
[12:02:20] <MacroMan> <MacroMan> Has there been any recent movement on allowing a blob dataType in $.ajax?
[12:03:38] <MacroMan> I'm aware I could just base64 encode the blob before sending, but it would be nice to have native functionality.
[12:04:10] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1525
[12:05:39] <MacroMan> robertmaxrees, I've seen that. Doesn't look like it was implemented though.
[12:06:16] <robertmaxrees> i linked that for context.
[12:06:24] <MacroMan> Ah OK.
[12:06:49] <robertmaxrees> you asked if there were plans, and that thread provides some info on that subject.
[12:06:57] <robertmaxrees> granted it's been a few years since it was last updated.
[12:07:11] <MacroMan> Thanks. Guess I'll keep using work arounds for now.
[12:07:31] <robertmaxrees> the thread mentions a plugin that was created fwiw
[12:09:39] <ThatWebGuy> I'm running this bit of code and from time to time it return a negative number.  How can I prevent it from doing that? Math.floor((mathRandom * homepage_carousel_images.length - 1))
[12:09:58] <robertmaxrees> ThatWebGuy what's a sample length value?
[12:10:11] <ThatWebGuy> 15
[12:10:29] <robertmaxrees> and how are you generating mathRandom ?
[12:10:41] <ThatWebGuy> I just had it where it did (0.045110576736938635 * 15 - 1) and it gave me -1.
[12:10:45] <ThatWebGuy> Math.random()
[12:11:11] <ThatWebGuy> I just assigned it to a variable so I could console log it to find out what was causing me to have a negative number.
[12:11:27] <robertmaxrees> so really you want to know how to make sure Math.random() givs you a sufficiently la3rge enough number.
[12:11:42] <ThatWebGuy> Yes.  Anything above .1 will work
[12:12:02] <snover> do you really intend to subtract 1 after multiplication? (remember your PEMDAS from school!)
[12:12:21] <robertmaxrees> snover i'm guessing he's trying to get a random index from an array.
[12:12:40] <ThatWebGuy> Yes I am robertmaxrees.  You helped me with this yesterday.
[12:13:51] <robertmaxrees> items[Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)]
[12:14:13] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  So I don't need the -1?
[12:14:31] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.  i'
[12:14:45] <robertmaxrees> *i'm sure snover could correct me on that though.
[12:15:03] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  I wasn't sure if it had to be there or not.  Thanks for the help.
[12:15:10] <snover> why do you think you should be subtracting 1?
[12:15:52] <ThatWebGuy> I as in here yesterday morning getting help and someone kept telling me I needed to.
[12:15:55] <ThatWebGuy> So I had it there.
[12:16:14] <ThatWebGuy> This was before robertmaxrees helped me out yesterday afternoon.
[12:16:41] <robertmaxrees> they probably aren't aware that Math.random() will never return 1.
[12:17:03] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  Thanks for the info on that.  I've never used Math.random() before.
[12:18:00] <Uhkis> you might wanna read the documentation if you're using something you haven't used before
[12:18:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:18:28] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random -> "The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1); that is, from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive) [...]"
[13:50:28] <harej> How do I find the nearest sibling of an element traversing upward through the DOM (not through ancestors, but through elements on equal footing)
[13:52:32] <taplar> ancestors is upward
[13:52:58] <taplar> siblings are on the same level
[13:53:23] <taplar> so do you mean you want to examine siblings before yourself?
[13:53:40] <harej> right
[13:54:14] <harej> specifically, I want the first H2 that comes before the given element
[13:54:33] <taplar> is the h2 the direct sibling?
[13:55:31] <harej> It's more like an uncle, it looks like
[13:55:49] <taplar> it's the parents direct sibling?
[13:56:08] <harej> yes
[13:56:34] <taplar> ok, so if you can use parent() or closest() to get the parent, then you could use http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/ to get the preceeding siblings to filter through
[14:15:20] <harej> Works, thank you!
[14:17:59] <tocka> hello
[14:18:33] <tocka> does jquery/js submit the array with keys? I mean I have 5 field names that have names of field[0], field[1], field[2]
[14:18:33] <tocka> etc
[14:18:52] <tocka> and I send the post via ajax
[14:19:00] <tocka> but when i check it in the console
[14:19:20] <tocka> it just says field[] = foo, field[]= bar, field[] = baz etc
[14:19:21] <tocka> :|
[14:19:36] <taplar> can you show us your ajax logic?
[14:20:43] <tocka> !paste
[14:20:46] <tocka> sure
[14:21:16] <tocka> taplar:
[14:21:17] <tocka> https://jsfiddle.net/z8nyo7k1/
[14:21:38] <momomo> when you bind on touchstart for an element ... the event will fire despite you starting the touch on another element ... isn't there an event that says .. when you start touching the screen on this element ... dragging finger there and releasing should not fire onstarttouch but only touchmove and touchend
[14:22:32] <robertmaxrees> momomo erm, those events always fire.  you're simply subscribing to them.
[14:22:50] <taplar> tocka: that logic isn't using the names on the elements at all
[14:23:17] <tocka> hmm.. you are actually right now that im looking at it :|
[14:23:24] <momomo> robertmaxrees: yes, but the touchstart fires even when you don't really start at that element
[14:23:30] <tocka> how could I fix it tho?
[14:23:45] <momomo> in that case, there's really no different than listening on touchmove ( and picking up the first event -> touchstart )
[14:23:54] <taplar> if all that data is in a form, you can just $(theForm).serialize() it
[14:24:48] <tocka> lets try it out :)
[14:27:21] <robertmaxrees> momomo https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events
[14:27:41] <tocka> thanks taplar
[14:27:42] <robertmaxrees> that has some good info and examples on the subject.
[14:27:42] <tocka> :)
[14:50:38] <sopparus> hello, how do I reach <div class="row" id="domme3">
[14:51:03] <sopparus> thought $('.row[name="domme3"]').remove(); would do it
[14:51:21] <robertmaxrees> $('#domme3').remove()
[14:51:40] <robertmaxrees> your [name="domme3"] is an attribute selector for the name attribute, not IDs.
[14:51:53] <sopparus> oh
[14:51:55] <sopparus> thanks
[14:52:01] <sopparus> should have come to irc sooner... :)
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:50:00] <mikedoty> $(xml).find("item[category='Search Me']") // works
[15:50:24] <mikedoty> $(xml).find("item[category='Search\" Me']") // throws an "unrecognized expression" error, with the escaped double quote
[15:51:26] <mikedoty> I've tried escaping it in a couple ways, but not having luck.  Is there a way to use the expression I want, or is the .find() function not able to handle double quotes in an attribute lookup?
[15:56:36] <pavonia> mikedoty: \\"?
[15:57:41] <mikedoty> No, but it looks like &quot; is valid -- though I'm still confirming that the behavior is as expected, the syntax error is no longer raised
[15:59:00] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ second paragraph on this page addresses it.
[15:59:09] <robertmaxrees> $(xml).find("item[category='Searc
[15:59:09] <robertmaxrees> h Me']")
[15:59:11] <robertmaxrees> woops./
[15:59:39] <robertmaxrees> theoretically, $(xml).find('item[category=\\"Search Me\\"]') should work.
[16:01:21] <mikedoty> Thanks robert, I'll check that out too
[16:13:55] <comet23> is jquery being phased out?
[16:14:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:14:21] <robertmaxrees> by whom?
[16:14:26] <comet23> everyone?
[16:14:33] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:14:53] <comet23> oh... well i guess trolls from other channels got me then
[16:15:06] <robertmaxrees> what channel were you in?
[16:15:16] <comet23> programming
[16:15:25] <comet23> but this wasn't today, it's just something i remembered
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> It really situational.  just like it always has been.
[16:15:44] <robertmaxrees> and depends on what you're doing.
[16:15:55] <robertmaxrees> some people might me using it less these days, but it's still a pretty relevant library imo.
[18:56:36] <taplar> off topic, in ES6, what is function({name1, name2}) as the definition?
[23:26:41] <alturic> Hey guys, I know it's a silly question but just looking to confirm... an input that contains      This is 3" and this is <script>alert('hacked');</script> heh. 'sometimes      would or wouldn't send entities? It would send the literal text, correct?
[23:27:41] <alturic> I'm grabbing the text via   var text = $('input#thetext').val();
[23:28:11] <alturic> I should have added, this is AJAX POST'd, my bad typing too fast.
