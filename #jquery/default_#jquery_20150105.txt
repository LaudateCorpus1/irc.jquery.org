[02:45:44] <paul_true> hi people, can somebody tell me how i find the nearest parent with a specific class?
[02:46:35] <guzzlefry> paul_true: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:48:09] <paul_true> but it would find following elemnt with my searched class too, right?
[02:49:17] <Uhkis> $(this).parent('.classname');
[02:54:44] <paul_true> it doesnt find the parent, if its multiple levels above my actual element.
[02:54:47] <paul_true> :(
[02:56:49] <Uhkis> then use parents
[02:58:55] <Meir`> hello. i'm using jquery mobile 1.4.0 and a theme toggler like in the demos: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/theme-default/
[03:00:54] <Meir`> it works until opening a new link that loads the whole webpage
[03:00:56] <paul_true> thanks, i will try it out ;)
[03:01:13] <Philip> how to remove comma from a array
[03:01:17] <Meir`> when i add to the link data-ajax="false", it will work too
[03:01:30] <Philip>  ["children[0]", "children[0]"]
[03:01:35] <Philip> it seem like this
[03:01:37] <Meir`> but i want to keep the animation, so i'm not really interested in data-ajax="false"
[03:02:06] <Philip> any help man
[03:02:29] <Philip> how to remove a comma between two array
[03:05:37] <Omar-> Meir` what do you want to achieve?
[03:05:48] <Meir`> a theme toggler, just like in demos
[03:06:11] <Meir`> it's a radio group buttons, that switches the container theme
[03:06:29] <Omar-> you want to change page's theme as well as its' content?
[03:06:37] <Meir`> no. only theme
[03:06:48] <Meir`> i'll explain more clearly
[03:07:08] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/w2aju3eo/
[03:07:09] <Meir`> when i open the page, there's a radio toggler like in demos
[03:07:24] <Omar-> that page uses this code http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/w2aju3eo/
[03:07:47] <Meir`> i know, i've already grabbed the code and customized it
[03:08:26] <Meir`> the problem is, that after loading a new url (not navigating between pages, a full page load), it no longer works
[03:09:19] <Omar-> are you placing code in head?
[03:09:20] <Meir`> yeah
[03:09:21] <Omar-> are you using Multi-page model or Single page model?
[03:09:40] <Omar-> MPM: all pages in one file. SPM: each page in a separate file
[03:09:48] <Meir`> SPN
[03:09:50] <Meir`> SPM*
[03:10:12] <Meir`> when i add 'data-ajax="false"' to the links
[03:10:25] <Meir`> the toggler works even after loading new page
[03:10:40] <Meir`> the question is why
[03:10:48] <Omar-> because you have to use "pagecreate" for that page
[03:10:53] <Uhkis> Meir`: if you don't save the choice (in a cookie for example), the browser can't remember the choice
[03:11:01] <Meir`> i have a "pagecreate"
[03:11:06] <Omar-> $(document).on("pagecreate", "#pageID", function () { the code });
[03:11:07] <Meir`> i load the same page
[03:11:25] <Meir`> the links are for pagination
[03:11:37] <Omar-> delegate pagecreate to that page
[03:11:40] <Meir`> so i load index.php?page=3, index.php?page=10, erc.
[03:11:41] <Omar-> using pageID
[03:11:49] <Meir`> etc.*
[03:12:10] <Meir`> i have a general selector: $( document ).on( "pagecreate", function() {
[03:12:10] <Meir`> for all "pagecreate"s
[03:12:24] <Omar-> do you have the same radios in all pages with same ID?
[03:12:33] <Meir`> it's the same page that loads
[03:12:49] <Meir`> i reload the same page with a different $_GET param
[03:13:12] <Omar-> hmmm, i'm not familiar with php
[03:13:13] <Meir`> the link href is "?page=10"
[03:13:33] <Meir`> i'm not sure that it's related only to php
[03:13:34] <Omar-> i'll brb
[03:13:40] <Omar-> it's related to jQM I assume
[03:13:45] <Omar-> ajax navigation
[03:14:11] <Meir`> yeah, overriding the theme class after loading a new url doesn't work
[03:14:34] <Meir`> Uhkis, i'm not trying to remember the selected theme
[03:14:58] <Meir`> i just want the toggler to work after pressing a link
[03:15:23] <Meir`> afterwards, i'll implement a storing method
[03:29:10] <ohcibi> hi i want to test the text of an html element with qunit. when using text() the text has several whitespaces inserted, seems like the underlying html is just stripped and the text left along with the whitespaces from the html-formatting.. this makes it hard to test for the content... i could use ok(string.match(..)) but then I would loose the "expected vs result" feature in the test results... how to test text properly?
[03:37:33] <washeul> hi all ,could anyone please take a look of my problem,i have 2 text box ,first is for input which can have any number and the second will output closest less number from the hidden inputs http://jsfiddle.net/2rc7ughf/
[03:37:54] <washeul> hi all ,could anyone please take a look of my problem,i have 2 text box ,first is for input which can have any number and the second will output closest less number from the hidden inputs http://jsfiddle.net/2rc7ughf/
[04:08:22] <RabSimpson> hi folks, can anyone see why the background images aren't appearing in this carousel?: http://dominoletting.gocircles.co.uk/properties/636/?bypass=1
[04:08:31] <RabSimpson> i had it working earlier but i can't determine what i've changed to cause them to stop appearing
[04:12:12] <Omar-> Meir` are you still there?
[05:23:09] <triplef> hi i think i need a guru.. http://jsfiddle.net/30hxae96/ , im trying to populate checkboxes with a json ajax return  it seems what i get is duplicates of parts of the append... im thinking it's because javascript does it async and therefore can put any part in any order.. am i right ?
[05:24:27] <triplef> http://jsfiddle.net/30hxae96/1/
[05:24:31] <triplef> reformated a bit
[05:25:20] <triplef> any input ?
[05:50:09] <bbclover> hey guys if I have $(".someclass a").on("click", ... this will fire on clicking an <a> tag which is a child of .someclass right?
[05:50:39] <Omar-> bbclover true
[05:50:53] <xec> triplef: i'm not sure what your question is, but you can only use JSON.parse() on strings (foo is an array)
[05:52:41] <bbclover> so I have this <ul class=".something"> and <li> inside with <a> tags. I want to be able to click the <li>'s instead of the little <a> links in them, how would I do that?
[05:52:52] <bbclover> cause I have a border around each <li> (it's tabbed navigation)
[05:53:33] <bbclover> I'll work on a mockup right now
[05:53:39] <xec> bbclover: i hope you mean <ul class="something">
[05:53:48] <xec> (without the .)
[05:53:51] <bbclover> xec: yeah haha
[05:54:55] <xec> bbclover: let me know when you got the demo up, i suspect you might be able to just do something like "li a { display: block; }" in css
[05:55:00] <bbclover> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/kk9kp9yw/
[05:55:19] <bbclover> I need display: inline though
[05:55:44] <bbclover> see how I can only click the <a> here?
[05:55:45] <bbclover> I want to be able to click anywhere in the <li> but still get the hredf
[05:55:45] <bbclover> href*
[05:55:46] <bbclover> maybe using closest or something...
[05:56:00] <xec> bbclover:  inline-block then? http://jsfiddle.net/kk9kp9yw/1/
[05:56:25] <bbclover> u can do that?
[05:56:51] <triplef> nm i found it
[05:59:13] <xec> bbclover: if you don't want the spaces between the tabs you can remove the whitespace from the html http://jsfiddle.net/kk9kp9yw/2/
[06:00:55] <bbclover> xec: how'd you remove that whitespace? I don't see any changes in css
[06:01:16] <xec> that's why i said "from the html" ;)
[06:01:49] <xec> "</li><li>" instead of "</li>\n\t<li>" so to speak
[06:03:02] <bbclover>  is there a way to do it with css so it's more readable
[06:19:36] <xec> bbclover: not as elegantly, unfortunately. If you're using static font sizes (px instead of em) you can set the font size of the UL to 0 and then back to the correct size on the LIs
[06:45:04] <mrchris_> Does anyone know of a 3rd party video gallery that I could embed into my site and make it look native to my site?  It should deal with the uploading, transcoding and displaying of videos.  ANyone?
[06:45:42] <mrchris_> It would allow users to upload their own videos into their own gallery.
[07:26:27] <epf> Hi - I'm totally new to this. I have a question about an issue with is(':focus')
[07:28:39] <NoiseEee> ok
[07:32:53] <epf> Specifically: is(':focus') doesn't seem to work with chrome, IE, safari when using any version of jQuery except 1.8.3. Is this a bug?
[07:33:24] <Omar-> epf maybe (":focus") was introduce in newer versions
[07:34:01] <Omar-> introduced
[07:35:20] <NoiseEee> what does 'not work' mean epf? what are you expecting?
[07:35:38] <NoiseEee> epf: can you set up an example on jsfiddle.net?
[07:35:41] <Hilton> Any way to animate .scrollLeft and .scrollTop simply?
[07:35:59] <Hilton> (in an element, not the main documenT)
[07:36:30] <epf> http://jsfiddle.net/EpF_jsfiddle/L7ypddh1/3/ - that version shows it not working with 1.10, but you can see it will work with 1.8.3
[07:39:22] <NoiseEee> first off, 10000% bonus for Steve Albini
[07:39:23] <NoiseEee> o
[07:39:28] <NoiseEee> brb will look
[07:39:37] <epf> :-D
[07:40:31] <epf> Thanks NoiseEee - not sure what brb means tho!
[07:42:15] <mooncup> epf: are you new to this whole internet thing?
[07:42:28] <mooncup> it means be right back
[07:42:52] <NoiseEee> weird indeed epf
[07:42:53] <NoiseEee> epf: it might just be a race condition difference; also, if you know you're clicking on an element, why check for focus?  it's automatically focused / you know its focused
[07:44:13] <epf> mooncup: heh, no, not at all. I guess I can't really explain that one!
[07:44:46] <Omar-> epf true, but here's another solution http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/L7ypddh1/4/
[07:45:00] <mooncup> epf: I'm pretty sure even my mother knows what brb means lol
[07:45:07] <mooncup> lol means laugh out loud btw
[07:45:33] <Omar-> mooncup rofl
[07:45:52] <Hilton> omg.
[07:46:14] <Omar-> Hilton can create a fiddle to test?
[07:47:26] <Hilton> Omar-: ...I guess? I only asked how I can animate the .scroll* properties of an element. CSS obviously doesn't handle it. Are there any auto-handlers in jQuery or do I need to write my own anim function?
[07:47:36] <NoiseEee> epf: there's also this i suppose http://jsfiddle.net/L7ypddh1/5/
[07:48:01] <epf> NoiseEee: It's because I'm checking for both focus and blur at the same time.
[07:48:41] <NoiseEee> epf: sure, but mine uses the clicked element to set the proper clas
[07:48:44] <Omar-> Hilton .animate({ scrollTop: value })
[07:48:59] <Omar-> value is number in pixels
[07:49:13] <NoiseEee> epf: but yeah, you could just check for 'focus'
[07:49:31] <NoiseEee> epf: ie: http://jsfiddle.net/L7ypddh1/6/
[07:49:32] <Omar-> Hilton you can do it with CSS too, animating top/left properties
[07:50:01] <epf> NoiseEee: I can use a different method, including yours or Omar's suggestions, but my real question was about whether it's a bug or not - how come it works with 1.8.3 but not before or after? There's this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13794 , but it says it *doesn't* work in 1.8.3
[07:50:04] <Hilton> Omar-: top/left affects scroll?
[07:50:34] <usc911> hey guys, I have tinymce on text area and when I select a colour it sets the style inline. Is it possible to add the !important attribute when selecting the color with jQuery?
[07:50:42] <Hilton> The element in question is a DIV which has elements inside that go far past it's own size, with overflow:scroll set. The DIV is already position:relative to accommodate the position:absolute elements inside.
[07:50:51] <Omar-> Hilton hmmm..not sure what you mean
[07:51:15] <epf> I was going to sign up for the bug tracker to add a comment, then I saw the guidelines about using IRC. Anyway, I couldn't see a sign-up link for the tracker
[07:54:09] <NoiseEee> yeah interesting epf. in general i find pseudo-selectors a little iffy anyways; i'd either pass the element or check an actual property on the element
[07:58:22] <epf> NoiseEee: Thanks. The problem with my real world implementation is that I'm using it to move very long <select>s around a large form to avoid the document size and performance becoming problematic, and it really has to trigger on focus and blur
[08:00:51] <NoiseEee> epf: is document size and performance indeed problematic otherwise, or are you just guessing / presuming
[08:01:38] <NoiseEee> if you can go for a bigger jsfiddle that would be good epf, but there are always 100x ways to skin a big black cat
[08:01:44] <NoiseEee> BIG BLACK get it
[08:12:36] <epf> NoiseEee: It's been a while since I set it up, but I'm pretty sure I was seeing performance problems before I started using this solution. Plus yslow was giving me a very bad grade on the number of elements on the page, e.g. a country select with 250 options being repeated 120 times. While it is the biggest by far, it's not the only large select on the page.
[08:13:59] <epf> But you're right - there's more than one way to skin a BIG BLACK cat. Maybe I should take a PAVEMENT SAW to it? Still, gotta stay UP BEAT or I'm liable to douse it all in KEROSENE and torch it, like THE GUY WHO INVENTED FIRE!
[08:14:05] <NoiseEee> right, of course you should use those dynamically/once if possible epf
[08:14:15] <NoiseEee> haha epf
[08:15:49] <epf> NoiseEee: I have to go, but thanks for the help. Just one last thing - do you know what I should do about bringing this up on the bug tracker?
[08:17:16] <NoiseEee> epf: i'm not sure it'll ever be fixed epf
[08:17:36] <NoiseEee> epf: once something has a "won't fix" i don't think theres much that can be done, but i could be wrong
[08:20:26] <epf> NoiseEee: Sure - it is only because it *does* work 1.8.3, I thought it might be worth pointing out for investigation. But I'll let it go. Cheers
[08:21:44] <caramba__> Hey Guys, i try to get the jquery backstretch plugin working. It works in chrome and safari but not in FF .. does someone has an idea what am i doing wrong? i try it here: ratepay.com the backstretch code is at the bottom
[08:26:56] <NoiseEee> epf: you should go for it perhaps; after all your issue is a bit different. I think you just need to login/create an account etc http://bugs.jquery.com/login
[08:32:54] <bigLanky34> Hello, can someone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/27zo87jr/
[08:32:55] <bigLanky34> basically what I am trying to do is get the text for the selected element, within that group, and set that selected option as the fieldset title
[08:33:08] <bigLanky34> right now, it is storing all 3 select values as a single value, and i need it to loop through each
[08:34:03] <BillCriswell> bigLanky34: Do $('select').val();
[08:34:52] <bigLanky34> where would I put that BillCriswell
[08:36:04] <bigLanky34> ah nm
[08:36:09] <bigLanky34> that worked perfect thanks BillCriswell!
[08:36:18] <BillCriswell> bigLanky34: I examined your problem a bit more and figured out more of your issue.
[08:37:08] <BillCriswell> bigLanky34: http://jsfiddle.net/27zo87jr/2/
[08:37:23] <caramba__> someone maybe? :)
[08:39:24] <robertmaxrees> helluva weekend folks.
[08:39:41] <robertmaxrees> what was your issue caramba__?
[08:39:49] <BillCriswell> I haven't been work work since Tuesday.
[08:40:00] <BillCriswell> It's so weird ot be back, but happy to be busy again.
[08:40:02] <robertmaxrees> whaaaat. nice.
[08:40:07] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: i try to get the jquery backstretch plugin working. It works in chrome and safari but not in FF .. does someone has an idea what am i doing wrong? i try it here: ratepay.com the backstretch code is at the bottom
[08:40:08] <robertmaxrees> good vacation?
[08:40:23] <bigLanky34> Bill, this is returning the value="myval" from the <option>, but is there a way to populate it with teh text between the <option> tags?
[08:40:46] <bigLanky34> instead of option_a I would like it as Option A
[08:41:05] <caramba__> bigLanky34: try text()
[08:41:08] <NoiseEee> bigLanky34: so ask for the .text() of the specific <option>
[08:41:10] <caramba__> .text()
[08:41:17] <BillCriswell> bigLanky34: Ah, then you'd use option:selected and .text()... but that smells.
[08:41:28] <robertmaxrees> caramba__ try $('.subheader').css('background-image');
[08:41:44] <robertmaxrees> in ff.
[08:41:46] <robertmaxrees> look what the console spits out ;)
[08:42:33] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: yeah it prints out an horrible url for the image but if i dump it through alert or i look into the code the url seems to be ok?
[08:42:45] <bigLanky34> BillCriswell: check http://jsfiddle.net/27zo87jr/3/
[08:42:52] <robertmaxrees> caramba__ i console logged it and got "none"
[08:42:54] <bigLanky34> when I change it to .text() this is what I get
[08:43:00] <bigLanky34> it combines all of them together
[08:43:44] <caramba__> bigLanky34: u have to select the specific option and strip the text out of it $("#list option[value='2']").text()
[08:44:11] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: hm do you have an idea whats going wrong there? not too good in js :(
[08:44:41] <BillCriswell> bigLanky34: http://jsfiddle.net/27zo87jr/4/
[08:45:20] <robertmaxrees> caramba__ i'm not seeing that you have a background on that container in the first place.
[08:45:54] <robertmaxrees> so fix that I guess?
[08:46:49] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: gimme a minute to dig in
[08:50:26] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: u know what. there is an background image set ... before the backstretch runs.. which makes sense cause backstretch removes that background an builds an new element
[08:50:45] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: when i dump the image variable in FF it gives me the url.. but the image still doesnt show up
[08:50:55] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it up then?
[08:51:45] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: k will do so
[08:51:48] <caramba__> thanks
[08:57:42] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: did it.. seems like image is not set but i honestly dont know why? http://jsfiddle.net/u4aum1o0/
[09:00:26] <robertmaxrees> caramba__ you have to include jquery and the plugin in the fiddle.
[09:01:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u4aum1o0/1/ like this.
[09:02:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u4aum1o0/2/ this is probably closer to what you want.
[09:09:55] <robertmaxrees> http://joostdevblog.blogspot.com/2015/01/what-most-young-programmers-need-to.html Good stuff here.
[09:12:07] <caramba__> robertmaxrees: thank u but its still not working in FF :(
[09:13:24] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yeah read that earlier this morning.
[09:13:31] <robertmaxrees> caramba__ seems like it's working for me.
[09:14:05] <robertmaxrees> woah over 100 open issues.
[09:14:54] <caramba__> ah now
[09:14:57] <caramba__> thank you so much buddy
[09:15:01] <robertmaxrees> caramba__ https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/issues/215 this looks similar - I think you're confused about how things are getting returned in different browsers.
[09:15:01] <caramba__> saved my life haha :)
[09:58:18] <bbclover> hey guys, I have tabs with certain ids and the one with the active tab is the one I display. Right now I'm doing $(".tab").removeClass("active"); $(id_of_tab_to_show).addClass("active"); Can I do this in one line?
[09:58:34] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:58:35] <bbclover> so the id of the tab also has class tab
[09:58:38] <bbclover> k
[09:58:44] <bbclover> was just curious
[09:58:54] <robertmaxrees> it makes it clearer that way anyway.
[10:19:49] <HumanBeing> Yo.  I'm upgrading a form to use the 'count up' features found at: http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
[10:20:10] <HumanBeing> Only, the counting never actually starts and console doesn't show any errors.
[10:20:40] <HumanBeing> It only shows: 0d 00:00:00
[10:20:59] <robertmaxrees> share your code in a fiddle?
[10:21:07] <HumanBeing> sure 1 sec
[10:22:27] <HumanBeing> oof!  I never used this before. thought you meant something else.
[10:22:32] <HumanBeing> Let me get this all together.
[10:22:38] <robertmaxrees> just share your js.
[10:22:40] <robertmaxrees> let's start there.
[10:22:50] <robertmaxrees> paste it in the javascript area and hit "save"
[10:22:57] <HumanBeing> yep
[10:23:11] <BillCriswell> guys
[10:23:19] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[10:23:22] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[10:23:28] <BillCriswell> It's been a while, had to bring it back.
[10:25:13] <HumanBeing> ok I don't see much happening after 'save'.
[10:25:20] <robertmaxrees> don't need to see anything happen.
[10:25:24] <robertmaxrees> just care about your JS for the moment ;)
[10:25:31] <robertmaxrees> no need for a functional example quite yet.
[10:25:35] <HumanBeing> gotcha
[10:25:53] <wodim> .mousedown() does not fire on ios 8 browser?
[10:26:06] <wodim> $("input[type=range]").mousedown() does not fire on ios 8 browser?
[10:26:07] <wodim> ^
[10:26:42] <robertmaxrees> wodim there's no mouse soooo
[10:26:48] <wodim> robertmaxrees: nice joke
[10:26:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm serious.
[10:27:09] <robertmaxrees> use .on('mousedown touchstart', function() {}); instead
[10:27:26] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[10:27:37] <wodim> on android it works
[10:27:41] <robertmaxrees> HumanBeing are you going to share the link to your fiddle ooorr...?
[10:27:41] <wodim> what's the opposite?
[10:27:46] <wodim> touchfinish?
[10:27:50] <wodim> touchend?
[10:28:01] <robertmaxrees> mouseup touchend
[10:28:04] <wodim> thank you
[10:28:23] <HumanBeing> ahh I just clicked my bad:
[10:28:24] <HumanBeing> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=v7vulEiChQ
[10:28:34] <robertmaxrees> ew togetherjs
[10:28:39] <HumanBeing> or?
[10:28:40] <robertmaxrees> where's your code?
[10:28:42] <HumanBeing> I didn't see any other link
[10:29:02] <bbclover> can I do $(".tab-links a").attr("href").substr(-1) to get the last character?
[10:29:08] <HumanBeing> I'll  try again.
[10:29:12] <robertmaxrees> HumanBeing http://i.imgur.com/XeTaIwr.png
[10:29:17] <robertmaxrees> click that, then share the page url out.
[10:30:31] <robertmaxrees> bbclover you want $(".tab-links a").attr("href").substr( $(".tab-links a").attr("href").substr(-1).length - 1);
[10:30:59] <HumanBeing> I did but there was no  page url for it.
[10:31:11] <robertmaxrees> HumanBeing the URL in your browser.
[10:31:41] <HumanBeing> It's just http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:31:45] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: wow
[10:31:46] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[10:31:55] <HumanBeing> yeppers
[10:31:57] <robertmaxrees> HumanBeing that's... interesting.
[10:32:03] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[10:32:14] <bbclover> > IE 5
[10:32:22] <HumanBeing> firebox
[10:32:25] <robertmaxrees> HumanBeing try http://fixee.org/home/
[10:32:25] <HumanBeing> *fox
[10:33:11] <HumanBeing> http://fixee.org/paste/htgcbpa/
[10:33:19] <robertmaxrees> woah wtf.
[10:33:41] <robertmaxrees> uuuhh....
[10:33:52] <robertmaxrees> can you pare this down to just the relevant bits?
[10:34:04] <HumanBeing> :) sure
[10:34:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, i get it - i don't care about the plugin code
[10:34:40] <robertmaxrees> i care about your code trying to use it.
[10:38:21] <bbclover> robertmaxrees can you explain to me that getting of the last character of the href with substr?
[10:38:23] <HumanBeing> http://fixee.org/paste/hq7lgvt/
[10:38:39] <robertmaxrees> bbclover huh?
[10:38:39] <bbclover> and can I do == 8 or do I have to do like == "8" if I want to compare it?
[10:38:48] <bbclover> $(".tab-links a").attr("href").substr( $(".tab-links a").attr("href").substr(-1).length - 1);
[10:39:00] <robertmaxrees> bbclover make a fiddle.
[10:39:42] <robertmaxrees> HumanBeing what are #{_bean.beginTime} and #{_bean.serverTime()} ?
[10:40:07] <HumanBeing> It's a jsf form so it's pulling data from a backing bean (java).
[10:40:22] <robertmaxrees> right - could you share the values you're populating those with?
[10:40:27] <HumanBeing> These are type Date.
[10:40:30] <robertmaxrees> examples.
[10:40:34] <HumanBeing> I'll paste the console output.
[10:43:39] <HumanBeing> http://fixee.org/paste/13qrkoj/
[10:44:09] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[10:44:37] <robertmaxrees> the plugin expects a date object.
[10:44:42] <robertmaxrees> not a string.
[10:44:50] <HumanBeing> i c
[10:46:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pdLezsdf/1/
[10:46:39] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/srjbj5y1/ so I want the next button to go to the next tab (with the edge case I'll add when it's the last case go back to the first tab
[10:47:32] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that's a really bad way to do this.
[10:47:37] <robertmaxrees> don't select on href values
[10:48:18] <bbclover> well the reason is because the tabs have ids corresponding to the hrefs (#tab1, #tab2, etc)
[10:49:01] <bbclover> so after I do something like var tab = $(this).attr("href"); I can just do $(tab).show();
[10:49:06] <bbclover> cause that href is an id
[10:49:10] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad way to do that.
[10:49:13] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:49:14] <bbclover> how would you do it?
[10:49:15] <bbclover> k
[10:49:40] <robertmaxrees> give the tabs classes to select on instead.
[10:49:54] <robertmaxrees> or use .next()
[10:50:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/srjbj5y1/1/
[10:50:23] <robertmaxrees> but don't select on href.  that's not what it's there for.
[10:53:37] <bbclover> can I do var currentActive = $("li .active"); to get the li with .active?
[10:53:41] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[10:53:46] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[10:53:47] <robertmaxrees> li.active
[10:53:49] <robertmaxrees> no space.
[10:54:00] <bbclover> right
[10:54:40] <jim_j> hi
[10:56:06] <jim_j> if I have a page that gets the URL  domain.com/page/?newsletter=login%40emaildomain.com what's the best way to pull the login%40emaildomain.com and place it into an input box 'email'
[10:56:54] <robertmaxrees> parse out the URL and grab it, then set the .val() of that input with that value.
[10:56:54] <jim_j> basic js without any jquery?
[10:56:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:57:09] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how you'd do it without jquery?
[10:57:22] <jim_j> I mean, no need to do it with jquery or better with?
[10:57:36] <robertmaxrees> the url parsing doesn't use any jquery.
[10:57:43] <jim_j> ok
[10:57:45] <robertmaxrees> selecting and setting the value of the input could.
[10:58:09] <robertmaxrees> hence my .val() suggestion.
[10:58:10] <jim_j> got it, thanks
[11:01:19] <bbclover> hey robertmaxrees how can I check if that .next() is done? like after the 8th tab
[11:01:45] <bbclover> can I compare it with null
[11:02:21] <robertmaxrees> try it and see.
[11:06:32] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: here's what I did: http://jsfiddle.net/srjbj5y1/2/
[11:07:53] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[11:08:08] <robertmaxrees> otherwise I'd add IDs or Classes to those to select on.
[11:18:05] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: so $("li.active").next() finds the next li, not the next li with .active class?
[11:18:22] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for more ;)
[11:19:19] <bbclover> all righty
[11:41:23] <pentagrass> I'm having trouble with this fiddle. Which is ironic because I made the fiddle to represent my real problem in the first place. http://jsfiddle.net/xguyu0ko/
[11:42:19] <robertmaxrees> $("#comment-window").prop("scrollHeight") wat
[11:42:24] <pentagrass> Sorry
[11:42:27] <pentagrass> one sec
[11:42:28] <pentagrass> http://jsfiddle.net/xguyu0ko/1/
[11:42:32] <pentagrass> That's it working with jquery
[11:42:43] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: I got that code from someone here
[11:42:52] <robertmaxrees> welp
[11:43:02] <BillCriswell> scrollHeight is a prop I think?
[11:43:10] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: All I want to do is scroll to the bottom of that div
[11:43:55] <pentagrass> I updated the code once more.... http://jsfiddle.net/xguyu0ko/2/
[11:44:14] <Jamesonwa> maybe add a class to it and use the scroll with css?
[11:44:29] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:44:48] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: This is working.
[11:44:54] <Jamesonwa> I found this article
[11:44:54] <Jamesonwa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7303948/how-to-auto-scroll-to-end-of-div-when-data-is-added
[11:45:12] <pentagrass> BillCriswell: The problem I have is that adding HTML content to the end of the div doesn't show the html content unless you manually scroll down
[11:45:17] <jim_j> if an input form has ID: Email and Name:  Email what do you usually use to set the val?  like $("#Email").val(val) for the ID?
[11:45:32] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: Which browser?
[11:45:34] <robertmaxrees> jim_j yes.
[11:45:41] <pentagrass> BillCriswell: Firefox
[11:46:02] <robertmaxrees> jim_j ids and classes are what you select on.
[11:46:03] <jim_j> thanks robert
[11:46:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xguyu0ko/3/
[11:46:40] <robertmaxrees> you could just do this instead.
[11:46:59] <BillCriswell> pentagrass: Works here
[11:47:34] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: you son of a gun, thank you so much man
[11:47:50] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: what was the problem with it in the first place?
[11:48:00] <robertmaxrees> i just made it simpler.
[11:48:04] <Jamesonwa> you may want to add break after the html
[11:48:12] <pentagrass> Jamesonwa: I did, :P
[11:48:23] <pentagrass> Jamesonwa: I forgot to do that in my prior versions of that fiddle
[11:48:27] <Jamesonwa> coo
[11:48:41] <Jamesonwa> good work robert
[11:48:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:48:55] <robertmaxrees> we get questions like that fairly regularly.
[11:48:59] <robertmaxrees> KISS and all that.
[11:49:31] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: if I want to be 100% up to date with the latest stable jquery releases, what should I use to bind? bind, on, live ?
[11:49:39] <robertmaxrees> .on()
[11:49:57] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: do you happen to know how far back .on() is implemented?
[11:50:01] <robertmaxrees> 1.8
[11:50:07] <robertmaxrees> iirc
[11:50:15] <BillCriswell> Do you happen to know which line of what file?
[11:50:21] <robertmaxrees> 1.7, sorry
[11:50:23] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:50:39] <robertmaxrees> there's a handy "version added' for the different method signatures.
[11:55:00] <pentagrass> BillCriswell: very funny
[11:55:12] <BillCriswell> :)
[11:55:23] <pentagrass> :P
[11:56:44] <bbclover> how do I select an a tag inside a li tag? I tried $("li").closest("a"); but that doesn't seem to work
[11:56:49] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[11:56:56] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes "up" the tree.
[11:57:00] <bbclover> ah
[12:00:58] <bbclover> man jquery is so powerful
[12:10:26] <pentagrass> Is there a way to guarantee that function calls in jquery happen synchronously?
[12:10:47] <robertmaxrees> if they are synchronous function call, they will happen synchronously.
[12:11:07] <NoiseEee> pentagrass: well certain (most) things are synchronous in JS.   what are you trying to solve?  ajax stuff?
[12:11:45] <pentagrass> NoiseEee: nah not AJAX, I juse use async: false with that.. it was more like a race condition...
[12:12:18] <pentagrass> aw crap that answers my own question.. I forgot to use async false
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> woah
[12:12:31] <robertmaxrees> don't do ajax calls like that :(
[12:12:47] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: why not?
[12:13:22] <robertmaxrees> you're defeating the entire point of the "a" in "ajax"
[12:13:33] <robertmaxrees> use callbacks instea.
[12:13:36] <robertmaxrees> *instead
[12:14:47] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: oh yeah huh
[12:15:34] <ehynds> pentagrass: sync requests lock the browser up until they're complete. at best you give your users a poor UX
[12:16:38] <pentagrass> ehynds: I can see how that would be a problem if there are lag issues
[12:16:56] <robertmaxrees> which there almost certainly always are :)
[12:17:05] <robertmaxrees> you're also working around the tools, instead of with them :)
[12:17:14] <ehynds> or your user is on their 3g cell phone about to enter a subway tunnel..
[12:20:12] <pentagrass> It's crazy how low level networking is a consideration this high up on the stack
[12:20:38] <robertmaxrees> it's not a consideration imo.
[12:21:07] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: I meant in the context of something that you have to take into account
[12:21:08] <robertmaxrees> at least not any more than a document ready is.
[12:21:42] <robertmaxrees> and i'm fine with that small bit considering the extra bit of control it gives me.
[12:22:15] <pentagrass> Where do you see javascript 10 years from now?
[12:22:39] <Primero> dead
[12:22:49] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, maybe dead, maybe not.
[12:23:14] <Primero> another language, maybe just now on development kill him
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> i think we might have other options for in-browser development maybe.
[12:23:31] <robertmaxrees> i personally like JS.
[12:23:32] <NoiseEee> oy if only someone asked/answered that 10 years ago, we could tar and feather them
[12:24:12] <robertmaxrees> i think JS gets a bad rap for things that aren't necessarily its own fault, like the DOM APIs.
[12:24:35] <jaakey> I hear microsoft's new browser is going to have a VB-DOM interface
[12:24:59] <pentagrass> vb-dom?
[12:24:59] <Primero> I think xhtml and js will be deprecate and another solutions will be emerge
[12:25:03] <NoiseEee> pentagrass: anyways, when you have questions like yours, the answer is usually "Callbacks!" which may/may not extend further into Deferreds/Promises
[12:25:09] <robertmaxrees> Primero xhtml technically is deprecated ;)
[12:25:56] <Primero> see, is happing
[12:26:00] <Primero> :D
[12:26:13] <robertmaxrees> Primero also, javascript is going to be around for a while.
[12:26:16] <Primero> is happend
[12:26:33] <Primero> sure, like cobol still exist
[12:26:39] <Primero> but you don use it
[12:26:46] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, i think it'll be actively used.
[12:26:47] <jaakey> c still exists
[12:26:53] <jaakey> and is widely and actively used
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> and not just for legacy purposes.
[12:27:10] <Primero> C is the lenguage for made languages
[12:27:29] <robertmaxrees> JS fills a nice niche, and with the proliferation of tools like Node.js I think we're seeing it really start to come into its own.
[12:28:08] <Primero> its the actual solution, but i think will emerge another solution, better js
[12:28:19] <Primero> soon
[12:28:32] <jaakey> the only way you could postulate that is if you had the better solution yourself, so.. I dare you!
[12:28:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.
[12:28:49] <robertmaxrees> and the language is evolving now anyway.
[12:28:52] <Primero> my experience seen new language and died language, said me
[12:29:00] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[12:29:46] <Primero> I have 30 years seeing the history, since I start programming, I see many language came and go
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing a lot of stability in languagest these days, and some langauges even returning to prominence
[12:30:44] <Primero> jaakey, im writing another language rigth now, but is not for the same of js, its for more high level, i think the sustitute of js, is more low level js
[12:31:15] <Primero> sorry for my english, i hope you can understand me
[12:32:08] <jaakey> do you think google will go on to make an engine for it as well?
[12:32:13] <jaakey> im sorry, that was snide
[12:32:49] <Primero> I think the people of firefox will make the sustitute of js, soon
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> Primero huh?  why?
[12:32:58] <robertmaxrees> what evidence do you have to support that?
[12:33:02] <Primero> they still dont know
[12:33:23] <robertmaxrees> hah, i have doubts that they'd do that, but OK.
[12:33:30] <Primero> nothing
[12:34:13] <Primero> I dont have evidence when I predict things, just happen
[12:34:52] <robertmaxrees> i really doubt that mozilla would try to move away from JS, especially after seeing what happened with Dart and old-school JScript.  plus they're working on Rust already.
[12:35:22] <Primero> dont said move away, evolution
[12:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean new versions of JS then?  because that's already happening.
[12:37:39] <Primero> no, new versions, like Visual Basic an Visual Basic net only use the same name, but its diferent thinks, js died for something called js, but its another think. Quick Basic and Visual Basic, only share the name, but its a diferent think
[12:37:45] <wodim> ...
[12:37:54] <wodim> changing to this channel and reading this
[12:39:15] <robertmaxrees> Primero i think you're conflating concepts, but okay.
[12:40:11] <Primero> maybe
[12:40:57] <Primero> maybe windows 3.1 and Windows 8 are just diferente versions of the same operating system
[12:41:03] <robertmaxrees> that's not a fair comparison.
[12:41:13] <Primero> maybe
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> your VB vs VB.net comparison ignores that VB was missing features you'd want to make it work with VB.net.  they're very similar languages otherwise.  that's like comparing Scala and Common Lisp - same core language, two different implementations.
[12:42:18] <robertmaxrees> err not scala.
[12:42:19] <robertmaxrees> Scheme
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> scheme and common lisp.
[12:43:17] <Primero> sorry I need back to work, i can troll anymore
[12:43:20] <Primero> :D
[12:43:23] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[12:43:30] <Primero> thanks, was fun
[12:44:11] <Primero> pentagrass was thinking abandon js :D
[12:46:08] <Primero> somebody use the chrome developer tools? how can I check the event .keypress of one jquery object?
[12:46:23] <bbclover> I thought the jquery docs favicon was the at&t logo haha
[12:46:51] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:56:55] <BillCriswell> Are we not men?
[12:57:23] <wa5ted> no
[12:57:24] <BillCriswell> If I don't get the right answer to that question in here I may have to retire.
[12:58:22] <BillCriswell> No one... wow.
[12:59:31] <BillCriswell> bbclover: http://fierth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/are-we-not-men-devo-documentary.jpg
[12:59:38] <Robdgreat> BillCriswell: wonder how many in here even know who Devo are
[12:59:50] <NoiseEee> are we not men, Robdgreat?
[12:59:55] <Snerf> haha, Devo
[13:00:04] <BillCriswell> Robdgreat: I'm too young for DEVO I think haha.
[13:00:11] <Robdgreat> me too, actually
[13:00:14] <NoiseEee> oh sorry i missed that BillCriswell did the same joke
[13:00:21] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: haha
[13:00:34] <Robdgreat> :D
[13:00:45] <NoiseEee> dude from Devo kicks ass, Mark Mathelsborough (terrible spelling)
[13:00:56] <BillCriswell> They reformed. I should see what their new stuff is like.
[13:01:09] <robertmaxrees> Mothersbaugh - also did the music for Rugrats
[13:01:10] <NoiseEee> ^^ he scores all of wes andersons movies
[13:01:18] <NoiseEee> robertmaxrees: yeah he's pretty awesome
[13:01:35] <BillCriswell> Robdgreat: Oh shit I didn't know that.
[13:01:38] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: *
[13:01:38] <robertmaxrees> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mothersbaugh#Soundtracks
[13:02:07] <BillCriswell> I recognized the name Motherbaugh but never knew it was one of the dudes from Devo.
[13:02:21] <NoiseEee> that is my kind of career
[13:02:43] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[13:02:44] <robertmaxrees> word
[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> he and elfman are nuts
[13:02:59] <NoiseEee> yeah
[13:03:14] <BillCriswell> Was elfman in any popular bands?
[13:03:19] <BillCriswell> Without looking it up...
[13:03:37] <robertmaxrees> yes, i can't remember the name though.
[13:03:45] <robertmaxrees> Oingo Boingo
[13:03:53] <BillCriswell> Never even heard of that one.
[13:03:54] <NoiseEee> haha
[13:03:54] <Snerf> I do remember Oingo Boingo
[13:04:04] <NoiseEee> yeah! Snerf you must be old like us
[13:04:10] <NoiseEee> i remember them having a bit in a movie too
[13:04:13] <Snerf> I am old :)
[13:04:14] <Robdgreat> oh gahhhh https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6nEAoBCcAAmsem.png
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> >.> i'm totally not old :(
[13:04:20] <Robdgreat> I don't want to live on this planet anymore
[13:04:27] <Snerf> I remember he scred Peewee's Big Adventure as well
[13:04:28] <NoiseEee> if its the rodney dangerfield movie where he goes to college, kill me and my memory

[13:08:16] <robertmaxrees> oooh i need to go to lunch at some poing.
[13:08:19] <robertmaxrees> *point.
[13:08:28] <Snerf> I watched the original Terminator the other day, I had no idea he was a punk rocker at the beginngon of the movie
[13:08:39] <BillCriswell> I should take more advantage of my lunch hour.
[13:08:40] <Snerf> blew my mind.
[13:08:44] <NoiseEee> Snerf: beauty trivia
[13:08:50] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: yes you should
[13:09:01] <Snerf> that was before he did Wierd Science as well
[13:09:20] <BillCriswell> In the spring I'll try to take naps by the river.
[13:09:32] <NoiseEee> i can still recall way too many lines from that movie (Weird Science)
[13:09:40] <Snerf> that movie was great :)
[13:09:58] <Snerf> heck, Robert Downey Jr in it.. even funnier
[13:10:07] <BillCriswell> john huges imdb picture is pretty funny.

[13:11:01] <NoiseEee> even with Steven Segal's anti-aging scheme, Snerf! its a wonder
[13:11:14] <BillCriswell> She didn't let herself age by the looks of it.
[13:11:16] <Snerf> hehe, lol
[13:11:30] <NoiseEee> also fuck hollywood, its impossible for women to live normal lives without messing up their faces surgically
[13:11:47] <Snerf> not all of them, just most
[13:11:53] <BillCriswell> You know what blows my mind all the time? The woman from Happy Gilmore is the Mom from Modern Family.
[13:12:15] <leatherface416> Who did she play in Happy Gilmore?
[13:12:23] <Snerf> hehe.. I just watch that show cuz I love Al Bundy :)
[13:12:31] <leatherface416> the hot Latin one?
[13:12:34] <BillCriswell> leatherface416: The blone woman.

[13:13:25] <NoiseEee> crazy BillCriswell
[13:13:37] <robertmaxrees> brb looking for a food.
[13:13:39] <leatherface416> ahh, gotcha
[13:14:09] <BillCriswell> She aged very well.
[13:14:19] <Snerf> she did
[13:14:37] <Snerf> sheesh, she is younger then I am.. so yes.. she did :)
[13:14:44] <eviljarred> she's so hot
[13:14:56] <NoiseEee> oh Snerf is older than even me
[13:15:03] <NoiseEee> sorry Snerf you're It
[13:15:12] <Snerf> I dont mind :)
[13:15:23] <Snerf> she's only a year younger
[13:15:23] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:17:33] <BillCriswell> She holds up next to Sofia Vergara and that is no easy task.
[13:18:06] <Robdgreat> Papa Snerf?
[13:18:09] <rangergord> BillCriswell: who? just joined
[13:18:23] <BillCriswell> rangergord: Julie Bowden.
[13:18:45] <BillCriswell> from Happy Gilmore / Modern Family haha
[13:19:01] <NoiseEee> Robdgreat: we know you're old too, no more under-the-radar bullshit  :P
[13:19:10] <Robdgreat> I'm only 34 ;)
[13:19:13] <rangergord> I guess
[13:19:21] <NoiseEee> oh not terrible i suppose Robdgreat, carry on
[13:19:28] * Robdgreat nods sagely
[13:19:35] <rangergord> looks great for her age most def
[13:24:08] <rangergord> I'm a webdev noob looking for a JQuery/JS tutor with experience in PHP (not for teaching PHP, but basically someone who can teach me to debug at any level of a PHP webapp). Anyone here up for it?
[13:25:51] <rangergord> not for free obviously
[13:30:25] <jaakey> reddit.com/r/jobbit
[13:31:50] <BillCriswell> rangergord: Not sure what level of commitment you're looking for but I'm sure you can get plenty of help just asking in here and other channels based on the topic.
[13:40:11] <HumanBeing> robertmaxrees, still here? I was able to get the initial time from the counter script to display with your help.  Thanks.  I do have another issue here though.
[13:57:16] <LindsayMac> Hello again. I'm working on this select box thing and I am honestly pretty noob with JS. I read a few tutorials and came up with this method for making a stylized select box that replaces the content with what you select. I've been told it's not the most effecient way to do it though but I think i'm stuck. I'm hoping someoen can open my eyes a big to learn how to write more effeciently http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayann
[13:57:16] <LindsayMac> g/dddt9vpg/
[13:57:18] <NoiseEee> rangergord: i mean, debugging a PHP web app would just happen on the php side. You can try ##php for help, but you'll want xdebug and a good IDE to hook into it
[13:57:25] <LindsayMac> oops. Link was cut off http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/dddt9vpg/
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> that was a good lunch
[13:57:47] <LindsayMac> The goal is ultimately to send a query based on which option was selected via AJAX
[13:59:11] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac this seems like a lot of effort just to get that dropdown working.
[13:59:33] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yea.. thats kinda what I was told.. I'm trying to find the better way to do it
[13:59:36] <LindsayMac> Like I said.
[13:59:49] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac so let's break this down - what exactly is this trying to do?
[13:59:52] <LindsayMac> also note a portion of that code inludes me ajax attempts
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> lt's ignore that party for now.
[14:00:17] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  basically i want to click a text, drop down appears, click an option in the drop down and have it replace the text that was there before it
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> okay.  one sec.
[14:00:27] <LindsayMac> I mean, it is essentially a prettier selectbox
[14:03:37] <robertmaxrees> brb - starting here though: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dddt9vpg/1/
[14:04:52] <mrchris_> Hi al.  How can I run this command "$( '.my_editor' ).ckeditor();"  for any new element that gets added to the page after it was initially rendered?  I'm adding elements dynamically.  Is there some way to watch for any new stuff and then run it?
[14:05:51] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  ok cool.. So you think its best to just write something than to use something like select2 , etc?
[14:14:53] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac back
[14:15:05] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac you've done most of the work yourself already.
[14:15:16] <robertmaxrees> so no real point to rolling something else.
[14:15:17] <LindsayMac> ok... I think thats why I was confused.
[14:15:27] <LindsayMac> I know it worked.... but I was told a bunch of times it wasn't effecient coding
[14:15:42] <LindsayMac> I prefer to learn the "right way" ... So I wanted feedback on how someone else might do it better
[14:15:46] <LindsayMac> does that make sense?
[14:15:55] <LindsayMac> I mean, what I have works, but wanted to know why it was so bad..
[14:16:14] <LindsayMac> also my version i was having a hard time getting the right data attribute for my query.
[14:16:21] <robertmaxrees> basically, you were doing too much.
[14:16:26] <LindsayMac> I thought maybe my code had something to do with it
[14:16:32] <LindsayMac> So if i'm doing too much, how do i simplify?
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> showing you now :)
[14:16:55] <robertmaxrees> so after you click an option, you want to swap the "TODAY" for whatever was clicked?
[14:17:41] <LindsayMac> ah ok .. sorry got ahead of myself
[14:17:45] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yes
[14:18:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dddt9vpg/2/
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> see how much less work it took to do exactly that?
[14:19:08] <LindsayMac> ok yes... I was setting up all of the obj and writing unecessary code
[14:19:27] <robertmaxrees> right - you were doing a bunch of things in a very roundabout way.
[14:19:58] <LindsayMac> yea.. thats what happens when you learn from a tutorial :)
[14:20:03] <LindsayMac> and you dont know if the tutorial is right
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> the tutorial may have been trying to teach from a different perspective.
[14:20:23] <LindsayMac> yea
[14:20:43] <LindsayMac> what I learned was still valuable, but when people tell you what you've done is the "long" way, its always good to learn the "rgiht" way
[14:21:52] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:23:03] <LindsayMac> something weird is happening on my end with your code.. when I click the option the whole page jumps up
[14:23:21] <LindsayMac> obviously you wouldnt see that on the jsfiddle because theres no content on the panel
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> that's an issue with the way you've nested things.
[14:24:28] <LindsayMac> because the content is outside of the <ul> to be replaced?
[14:24:45] <robertmaxrees> no, because the UL is trying to expand to fit the space it's been given
[14:24:46] <LindsayMac> how do you mean?
[14:24:53] <LindsayMac> no thats not what I mean
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> oh, easy. one sec.
[14:25:15] <LindsayMac> I mean after I click and the text updates the <span> the whole page scrolls to the top
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dddt9vpg/4/
[14:26:30] <LindsayMac> curious.. whats the change you made?
[14:26:48] <LindsayMac> ah.. preventdefault?
[14:27:07] <robertmaxrees> yep - passing the event object and then running e.preventDefault();
[14:27:15] <LindsayMac> fixed.. perfection.
[14:28:41] <LindsayMac> So to pass that $this.text to my ajax.. i do what i was doing with the other code, right?
[14:29:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:30:26] <LindsayMac> Sorry i am working on this two part... First was to learn the best way to make my code more effecient
[14:30:43] <LindsayMac> I need to get the data-attribute (or $this.text) to pass as a variable to my php I wrot e
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> right - get that you're asking something about passing text.
[14:31:02] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[14:31:21] <LindsayMac> yea sorry..
[14:31:51] <robertmaxrees> where are you trying to use that in the ajax?
[14:32:22] <LindsayMac> on the click basically
[14:32:33] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase - I see what you're trying to do.
[14:32:34] <LindsayMac> I was doing it at the same time i updated the text in the <span>
[14:32:39] <robertmaxrees> where does the data-value come into play?
[14:32:55] <robertmaxrees> is that getting passed as apart of the data object?
[14:33:01] <LindsayMac> well i was going to use that instead of .text just because I always felt it was more standardized
[14:33:04] <LindsayMac> yes..
[14:33:22] <LindsayMac> that data attribute will be passed as a variable to my php using $_POST
[14:33:28] <LindsayMac> or $_REQUEST
[14:33:44] <robertmaxrees> right, so what should it be named in the data getting passed in?
[14:34:14] <LindsayMac> yes
[14:34:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not a "yes" or "no" question.
[14:34:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dddt9vpg/6/
[14:34:54] <robertmaxrees> look here - in this case you're passing two properties to your PHP - one called "action" and another called "chosenDay"
[14:34:55] <LindsayMac> Oh i'm sorry.. lol
[14:35:16] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your PHP is expecting, so you might need to change chosenDay to some other name.
[14:35:39] <LindsayMac> well.. I can change it up.. i have my queries all ready but I can change what it's expecting
[14:35:51] <robertmaxrees> you can change either side - doesn't matter to me.
[14:35:55] <LindsayMac> basically its expecting 1 of 5 options.. today, this week, this weekend, etc
[14:36:02] <robertmaxrees> just illustrating how you pass data from one to the other.
[14:36:43] <robzilla> when using .sortable() is there a way to identify the object that was moved? (not the one you dragged but the one that it moved out of the way)
[14:36:43] <LindsayMac> ok i have to reread what you wrote ;)
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dddt9vpg/7/ - this one removes a trailing comma that'd break older versions of IE.
[14:38:33] <LindsayMac> ok..
[14:38:38] <LindsayMac> I need to read through this for a sec ;)
[14:46:58] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: so if I wanted to test my output of chosenDay (with the ajax code you gave me ), would I do console.log(chosenDay);
[14:47:39] <robertmaxrees> there is no output to chosenDay
[14:48:49] <robertmaxrees> that's just a property in an object.
[14:49:33] <LindsayMac> Just for my own learning.. if i wanted to log the value of the selected element on success, how would I do that?
[14:49:49] <robertmaxrees> the data-value?
[14:49:54] <LindsayMac> yea
[14:50:04] <robertmaxrees> currentValue
[14:50:05] <LindsayMac> does that make sense? Usually when I was learning PHP I learned by dumping all of the objects and variabkles
[14:50:06] <LindsayMac> haha
[14:50:09] <LindsayMac> ohhh
[14:50:30] <robertmaxrees> because that var exists in that child function.
[14:50:41] <LindsayMac> got it.. THat helps me SOO much more
[14:50:48] <robertmaxrees> welcome to scope.
[14:51:06] <LindsayMac> now I can do $_POST[‘chosenDay’] in my function and a switch statement for each one
[15:27:37] <royalty> hello
[15:27:43] <royalty> does this not work because of a scope issue?
[15:27:44] <royalty> http://jsfiddle.net/gd5v6j4f/1/
[15:28:09] <royalty> sorry i meant this
[15:28:09] <royalty> http://jsfiddle.net/gd5v6j4f/2/
[15:28:25] <robertmaxrees> royalty properties need names.
[15:28:51] <royalty> are you referring to the ''?
[15:29:01] <royalty> because it worked in regular javascript
[15:29:06] <robertmaxrees> you can make them work with empty strings for names, but that's a really bad idea.
[15:29:09] <royalty> i was able to set the innerhtml
[15:29:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gd5v6j4f/3/
[15:29:41] <robertmaxrees> it works, either way.
[15:29:49] <robertmaxrees> but don't use empty strings for property names.
[15:31:14] <royalty> strange
[15:31:17] <royalty> why is mine not working
[15:31:24] <royalty> is it just the css?
[15:31:39] <robertmaxrees> because the div doesn't take any space - there's nothing to click.
[15:31:52] <royalty> oh lol
[15:32:05] <royalty> thanks sir
[15:34:46] <pentagrass> Is jquery faster or as fast at doing getElementById() in javascript?
[15:34:53] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[15:35:14] <robertmaxrees> it actually uses that under the hood if it sees that you're selecting an element by ID.
[15:35:43] <robertmaxrees> it'll be a touch slower because of the initial detection, but the performance hit is so minimal it's not anything to worry about.
[15:35:59] <pentagrass> so... if( selector[0] == '#' ){ document.getElemenetById } ???
[15:36:10] <robertmaxrees> it's a little more involved than that, but effectively yes.
[15:36:17] <robertmaxrees> it then passes the object through the jquery constructor.
[15:36:34] <pentagrass> right yeah, I wasn't trying to recreate it, just get the general idea across
[15:37:04] <robertmaxrees> those two things combined will actually make it definitely slower, but the cost is minimal and easily mitigated.
[15:55:45] <RudyValencia> Hi, robert_ and I are trying now to get data attributes to carry into a modal, example at www.bootply.com/fkebvuHsra , but we aren't having much luck; how do we get the data-cardno attribute to carry into the modal?
[15:56:00] <robertmaxrees> who?
[15:56:16] <RudyValencia> he's coming in
[15:56:18] <RudyValencia> there
[15:56:20] <robert_> sorry, hi. :p
[15:56:37] <robert_> robertmaxrees: me. :P
[16:10:36] <Valduare> hey guys I got this http://jsfiddle.net/wa1av3bm/3/  trying to figure out how to make this sticky. - if you click the orange shopping cart icon  it pops up a little windows  this window I need to stay in position  while scrolling so its in view
[16:19:10] <robertmaxrees> RudyValencia y'all are doing this the hard way.
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> RudyValencia do you guys want all the cards to swap, or just the clicked one?
[16:21:07] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[16:22:31] <RudyValencia> We just want the data-cardno in the elements indicated with data-placeholder.
[16:23:06] <robertmaxrees> okay - first up you should use a class, not a data attribute for that.
[16:25:22] <robert_> woot. :D
[16:25:36] <RudyValencia> we got it! :)
[16:26:03] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[16:26:11] <robert_> robertmaxrees: refresh.
[16:27:00] <robertmaxrees> not loading.
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dmn9jk0e/
[16:27:22] <robertmaxrees> this is how I was going to suggest you do it.
[16:28:02] <robertmaxrees> slightly smarter version: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dmn9jk0e/1/
[16:29:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah that bootply site is giving me an application error.  weird.
[16:30:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah - don't do it that way.
[16:34:04] <robertmaxrees> you're incurring a bunch of extra, unnecessary overhead within that for loop.
[16:44:24] <robert_> yeah
[16:59:06] <rangergord> NoiseEee_: sorry, just came back. It's actual tutoring I want, like fast-starting me with a 1/2 day webdev crash course, enough to let me accomplish the specific task I had in mind.
[17:00:09] <rangergord> I realize most experienced devs would look down on this sort of thing, but I figured hey, maybe there's someone that wouldn't mind a super-shot gig like that.
[17:00:23] <rangergord> *super-short
[17:00:43] <robertmaxrees> rangergord what exactly are you expecting to get out of that kind of arrangement?
[17:00:58] <robertmaxrees> what's the specific task you have in mind?
[17:01:59] <rangergord> robertmaxrees: well, explanation of the basics of JQuery, and given JS code (I dont know JS but I spent a week-end learning it on my own. It's slower than when someone is spoon-feeding you), explaining what it's doing, how to tell which parts are pure JS, which are JQuery, which are <random lib>
[17:02:14] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery btw
[17:02:34] <robertmaxrees> and your original question was about PHP.
[17:03:07] <robertmaxrees> and most folks will probably point out that's not a very good way to learn.
[17:03:33] <robertmaxrees> feel free to ask questions in here, though, and we can help you for free, no problem.
[17:04:01] <rangergord> it's not a career thing for me, I got a full-time job in C++, but I told a friend I'd modify some internal script someone's nephew wrote. The PHP was easy to understand, but the mix of jQuery + JS + JS libs was an obstacle.
[17:04:40] <robertmaxrees> then ask away in here :)
[17:04:49] <rangergord> hehe, fine. Thanks.
[17:05:51] <sammych> codeschool?
[17:06:06] <sammych> code academy?
[17:06:21] <robertmaxrees> sammych if you look at their prior requests, they basically want help through a specific file (or set of files).
[17:06:38] <robertmaxrees> since they're already a developer, they probably just need somebody to bounce ideas offof.
[17:06:41] <robertmaxrees> *off of
[17:06:44] <sammych> okay dokey
[17:24:42] <bradfordli123> How do I post data to a URL within an event listener?  For instance I created a JSON object I want to post to a URL
[17:25:01] <robertmaxrees> using ajax?
[17:25:07] <SirLagz> bradfordli123: $.post() ?
[17:25:10] <AcidRain2012> xdvsnjjjlol
[17:25:26] <robertmaxrees> if no ajax, you'll need to use a form.
[17:26:41] <bradfordli123> I have a form. RIght now I have an eventlistner on the form. Within the event listener, I create an object and I want to send it to a URL but it isn;t getting sent
[17:27:00] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 are you sending it via ajax?
[17:27:14] <bradfordli123> I tried $.post(url, obj) but I dont see it when I redirect
[17:27:23] <robertmaxrees> err, that's using ajax.
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> share your code in a fixee or something ;)
[17:29:43] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: here ya go https://gist.github.com/liondancer/01173270965841c21da0
[17:30:05] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:30:14] <robertmaxrees> this explains a lot.
[17:30:32] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: what is it?
[17:30:34] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to add additional payload data to an existing form - you can't do that this way.
[17:31:06] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: ooo i see yea that is what I am trying to do
[17:31:45] <robertmaxrees> you can do one of two things - 1: add a hidden input to your form and stuff your data in there, then populate in the submit.
[17:31:50] <robertmaxrees> or fully ajax the whole thing.
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> the former will be much easier.
[17:32:54] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[17:35:43] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: sorry i was speaking with someone
[17:35:56] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: Ill read what you suggested and think about it really quick
[17:37:17] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: i think i understand your logic but I'm new to JS/jQuery so not quite sure how to do this
[17:37:32] <AcidRain2012> nice nick
[17:37:46] <AcidRain2012> taking otu the T would make it better
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 sorry was away for a sec.
[17:53:24] <tds5016> hi. Is there anyone here familiar enough with jasmine they could help me figure out how to use the clock correctly?
[17:53:26] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: no worries!
[17:53:52] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 so you can create an input type="hidden"
[17:53:54] <robertmaxrees> in your html.
[17:55:08] <robertmaxrees> you could give them IDs that match the properties in your testData object, set them, and then do your normal form submit.
[17:58:03] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: i asked someone from #javascript and they suggest $.post()
[17:58:17] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use $.post() to do what you want in this case.
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> i saw that suggestion, too, but it won't work with a normal form post.
[17:58:52] <robertmaxrees> that's for ajax - you mentioned a redirect not properly working, right?
[18:00:29] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: yeaa I am using Django and I have a function in python that shoudl redirect to another page if /test/ got a request. It seems to me that the data is being sent but I am not getting redirected
[18:00:51] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase you're mixing ajax and a normal post.
[18:00:52] <robertmaxrees> not what you want.
[18:01:03] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: darn
[18:01:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4gq57bb6/1/
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> this is one way to do it.
[18:02:49] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: Ill give it a shot!
[18:02:51] <bradfordli123> thanks!
[18:55:18] <MarvelDigital> i have a jquery script inside a div that's supposed to load jplayer to play videos, ... this works in chrome and other browsers, but not on firefox (both mobile and linux). is there a fix for this?
[19:21:10] <R13ose> If I am doing this: console.debug($(slide).find('a#slideimage')); and want to grab the inline style background-image url, how do I do that?
[22:16:08] <gtek1k> I want to make a similar effect to this menu but mine I need vertical text links only  http://www.ndesign-studio.com/demo/css-dock-menu/css-dock.html
[22:16:33] <gtek1k> anyone have any experience with or know of on existing solution?
[22:45:45] <Hilton> I'm trying to animate two items at once - the position of a bunch of elements inside a scrolling div, and the scroll position of the div itself (so it stays centered on a particular item during the transition). http://jsfiddle.net/zmwd495L/2/ - how can I get it to stay on the yellow dot during the size changes?
[22:48:46] <Hilton> OOps, forgot a line of code. http://jsfiddle.net/zmwd495L/4/
[22:57:41] <Hilton> Alright, I found that I can make them line up if I animate BOTH in jQuery, but I've got far too many elements to let jQuery animate them; the system bogs down so much that they don't even animate.
