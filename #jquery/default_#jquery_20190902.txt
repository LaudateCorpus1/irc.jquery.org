[01:52:20] <crs> Hey guys, I could really do with some help here. I have an animation problem where on hide() element gets scaled out of its position before animation starts, please have a look here: https://codepen.io/djll/pen/pozrPVQ Thank you!
[01:58:58] <Cork> crs: have a look at the blind call, i suspect it is what causes the problem
[01:59:12] <Cork> my experience is that jquery-ui tends to cause animation problems
[04:45:15] <crs> Cork: Any other way to get animations like tha easily? Some other libs?
[05:22:51] <Cork> crs: css key_frams should be fairly easy, its just a width animation
[05:23:07] <Cork> opps KeyFrame
[05:33:29] <crs> Cork: OK, thank you, will have a look.
[05:34:48] <crs> Cork: Hmm, seems quite complicated at start. I dont know js almost at all.

[06:37:17] <Mariaa> https://bit.ly/2koTC9H
[06:37:36] <Mariaa> if the above not works, try bitly one please thykka
[06:43:37] <Mariaa> thykka any clue?
[06:44:11] <Woet> Mariaa: why do you keep shortening the link?
[06:44:34] <Woet> https://www.renoassistance.ca/en/home-renovations/architects-technologists/
[06:45:22] <Woet> and no, we're not going to debug 2429 lines of HTML with 20 JS files for you
[06:45:30] <Woet> turn it into a test case using https://jsfiddle.net/
[06:49:34] <Mariaa> Woet the problem is in this particular page, it works on my test server bt not here.
[06:49:49] <Woet> Mariaa: then you did not create a proper test case.
[06:50:39] <Mariaa> the code is correct  and working 100%, looks like its loading in wrong order on server.
[06:56:26] <crs> Mariaa: OT, scrolling on that page is awful!
[06:56:38] <Woet> Mariaa: I'm not seeing you loading jQuery itself.
[06:58:10] <Woet> also, it's insane people actually pay for this kind of web development work
[06:58:31] <Woet> 155 requests, 6.7 MB of resources
[07:29:38] <thykka> x)
[07:30:13] <thykka> this just in: you can't build a decent website with wordpress and plugins alone
[07:30:34] <thykka> especially if the idea is to add a plugin for everything you can think of
[13:06:36] <Hinette> Hello
[14:57:53] <gonzolo> hello, can someone please tell me how to find out which event has been fired when I click a checkbox? I tried opening the sources and tab in chrome dev tools to see if I can trace it and also grepped the code for that checkbox name but I can't find the even handler.
[15:50:11] <NetersLandreau> Hi folks.. how can i do a $.get() and get the response to be available outside the method?
[16:13:20] <Woet> NetersLandreau: you put it into a global variable.
[16:18:28] <NetersLandreau> Woet: i tried that let myglobal; $(function() { … $.get(myurl, function(response, status) {
[16:18:32] <NetersLandreau> oops
[16:18:54] <NetersLandreau> !paste
[16:19:20] <Woet> NetersLandreau: be aware that it's asynchronous
[16:19:28] <Woet> that means it won't be populating the variable until the AJAX request is complete
[16:22:25] <NetersLandreau> Woet: thanks.. i think i’m missing something because i can log the response and assign it to the global var i instantiated but after the method, the var is unassigned
[16:29:19] <Woet> NetersLandreau: yes, because it's async.
