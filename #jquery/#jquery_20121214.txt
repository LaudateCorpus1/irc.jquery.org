[00:01:40] <s34n> pixolin: your circle is in the div.innerbox?
[00:02:01] <pixolin> give me a while, I'm about to write some jsfiddle code
[00:02:27] <UltraMC> Cork, THANK YOU !!!
[00:02:28] <s34n> pixolin: and your map tile is displayed in the div.outerbox?
[00:02:57] <pixolin> hehe, as I saidâ€¦ give me a moment to create an example
[00:03:02] <Cork> UltraMC: yw
[00:04:11] <coldhead> Cork, s34n: best of luck
[00:10:45] <MACscr> any suggestions for making this arrow transition in a smooth manner when its clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/hThGb/1501/
[00:14:10] <pixolin> OK, I think this is easier to explain: http://jsfiddle.net/8xjtt/ -- what I want is that if I hover over the left div.outerbox, the blue innerbox shows up and if I move over to the right div.outerbox, the red div.innerbox shows up. however, it doesn't toggle as long as I hover over the displayed div.innerbox.
[00:15:22] <pixolin> I tried to work with layers (z-index) but to no avail.
[00:15:25] <nocturne7> what's the best way to rebind events in JQuery after an AHAH request ?
[00:15:31] <Zesty> Hey, how do I scroll to the top of an unordered list which is contained within a set-height div that has overflow-y: scroll?
[00:20:06] <biyectivo> Hi
[00:20:23] <biyectivo> I'm having a bit of trouble with a certain jquery code, in IE8 and less
[00:21:02] <biyectivo> http://jsfiddle.net/g8Auj/
[00:21:23] <biyectivo> any ideas? works flawlessly in IE9, Chrome, Firefox
[00:31:45] <Alopex> Hello! I'd like to build a multipage form in jquerymobile (each page has a question, then 4 answers (radiobuttons) and user has to choose one). But I can't figure out how to build multiple page forms in jquerymobile. any help?
[00:35:03] <s34n> pixolin: hover take two functions
[00:35:15] <pixolin> no. not necessarily
[00:35:16] <s34n> pixolin: you left off the function to hide
[00:35:25] <s34n> so it doesn't hide
[00:35:39] <pixolin> you can see it works if you entirely leave the div.outerbox
[00:35:55] <pixolin> so .toggle() isn't my problem
[00:39:43] <s34n> pixolin: yeah. looking...
[00:40:16] <pixolin> s34n: my problem is more as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5213159/jquery-hover-div-underneath-another-layer
[00:40:45] <pixolin> I'm still not quite happy with the solution to set pointerevents: none; although that would work (on some browsers)
[00:43:19] <pixolin> s34n: have a look here, this shows how I want it (if you use a modern browser): http://jsfiddle.net/8xjtt/2/
[00:43:50] <pixolin> I think I'll stick with this. This stupid map crap has kept me busy the whole week now.
[00:45:05] <klusias> hello. anyone knows jquery plugin who looks like this: http://imgur.com/Ss5Rr (its image carousel)
[00:48:55] <Cork> klusias: most likely not, you have to have css3 transform to do that
[00:49:38] <noregret> is tehre something wrong with var pretty = JSON.stringify(metadata, undefined, 2); ? because when i console.log() it, it is not beutified, but when i put in in firebug's console and run that there, it gets beautified.. any ideas ?
[00:49:41] <klusias> Cork, ok, but something similar? at least funcionality with focus image, scroller and smaller thumbnails on both sides
[00:50:14] <Cork> noregret: i don't think stringify takes 2 arguments
[00:50:22] <Cork> ?mdn JSON.stringify
[00:50:24] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "mdn JSON.stringify" in jQuery Docs.
[00:50:26] <Cork> ?mdc JSON.stringify
[00:50:31] <bot-t> Cork, stringify - JavaScript | MDN - Convert a value to JSON, optionally replacing values if a replacer function is specified, or optionally including only the specified properties if a replacer array is specified. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify
[00:50:50] <Cork> hmm apparently it does; interesting
[00:51:12] <noregret> yep
[00:51:22] <noregret> it works fine in the console ,but not in my code
[00:51:36] <Cork> what error do you get when its in the code?
[00:52:05] <noregret> no errors, it is printed plainly with not beauty :)
[00:52:50] <noregret> Cork: http://pastie.org/5525768
[00:52:53] <Cork> might be that console.log removes the line breaks
[00:53:25] <Cork> uh is it in console.log you get the problem or in append?
[00:53:37] <Cork> cause i would understand append/text
[00:53:43] <noregret> Cork: both, and in the firebug console, console.log() prints it nicely
[00:54:09] <Cork> try doing append('<pre> + pretty + '</pre>')
[00:54:22] <s34n> klusias: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex14/carousel.htm
[00:55:13] <noregret> Cork: it got printed as a single line.. seems that stringify isn't working here..
[00:55:31] <noregret> Cork: working fine in firebug's console though.. strange..
[00:55:33] <Cork> noregret: can you generate an example in jsfiddle?
[00:55:43] <noregret> alright
[00:55:51] <Cork> that does everything that is
[00:55:57] <Cork> a working example
[00:59:54] <s34n> klusias: http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/carousel.htm
[01:01:31] <noregret> Cork: my damn luck, it's working fine in jsfiddle too but not in  my code :/
[01:02:11] <Cork> sounds like its something you're doing in you're code
[01:02:29] <noregret> Cork: you saw the paste for that event..
[01:02:39] <noregret> that's it
[01:02:58] <Cork> there might be something else in the code doing it
[01:03:06] <s34n> klusias: http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout
[01:03:13] <Cork> ex. what you give to stringify might already be a string
[01:04:08] <noregret> Cork: oh shit, it is a string
[01:05:47] <noregret> Cork: fixed, thanks :)
[01:05:54] <Cork> lol
[01:06:07] <Cork> so the example was dead on; thats funny :)
[01:07:04] <sadtaco> I have a problem.  JSON.stringify(localStorage).length returns 56, when it's saying NS_ERROR_DOM_QUOTA_REACHED when I try to add something to localstorage.  I think the issue might be that I have instances of localStorage in iframes on subdomains, to circumvent the limit on storage size.  Maybe it's still calculating them as the limit for that domain.
[01:07:59] <nocturne7> does on() function work on html file that will be re-fetched ?
[01:08:09] <nocturne7> I can't seem to get it to work
[01:08:37] <Cork> nocturne7: the element you bind the event on has to stay
[01:08:49] <noregret> Cork: \m/
[01:08:52] <Cork> if the element will be replaced bind it on a parent as delegated
[01:09:19] <nocturne7> Cork, I bounded it on document, still did not work.
[01:09:37] <Cork> $(document).on('event', 'selector', function() {}) ?
[01:09:43] <nocturne7> yes
[01:09:51] <Cork> is the page reloading?
[01:10:02] <Cork> cause if it doens't that should never be a problem
[01:10:27] <nocturne7> it's not reloading
[01:10:56] <nocturne7> it's just reloading the html on certain portion of the page
[01:11:01] <Cork> ?p @ nocturne7
[01:11:12] <Cork> <_<
[01:11:16] * Cork pokes bot-t
[01:11:28] <Cork> ah, its dead...
[01:11:29] <nocturne7> Cork, re-fetching via get() ajax call
[01:11:58] <Cork> nocturne7: could you pastebin your code on jsfiddle
[01:16:00] <nocturne7> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/HuuQZ/
[01:16:32] <mkoks> hey
[01:17:13] <Cork> nocturne7: and what replaces the content?
[01:18:59] <nocturne7> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/HuuQZ/1/
[01:19:31] <nocturne7> it's in a different function, just copied the section that makes the AJAX call
[01:20:09] <Cork> can't see a reason why it would fail
[01:23:39] <noregret> how can I check if an object is a JSON object ?
[01:24:06] <mkoks> jeez, I want to eat
[01:24:08] <Cork> variable.constructor === Object
[01:24:46] <Cork> noregret: or if you meant a json object compared to a javascript object
[01:24:47] <Cork> you can't
[01:24:56] <Cork> they're both the same object type
[01:25:43] <noregret> i see
[01:26:47] <mkoks> can someone send me some pizza in jsoon?
[01:26:50] <mkoks> can someone send me some pizza in json?
[01:27:01] <Cork> or to be more precise json object is a string
[01:27:10] <Cork> if its not a string its just a javascript object
[01:27:56] <noregret> Cork: aha, how can I check if it's string
[01:28:04] <noregret> using typeof ?
[01:28:10] <Cork> thats what i gave you before
[01:28:14] <Cork> yes type of or constructor
[01:28:19] <Cork> depending on what you want to use
[01:28:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> could someone explain to me why getJSON doesn't download the whole JSONP file?
[01:28:49] <Cork> the whole?
[01:29:02] <Cork> if it doens't then you're server isn't sending it
[01:29:13] <Cork> make sure it parses
[01:38:20] <nocturne7> Cork, it actually works, I don't know why it did not work before.
[01:38:28] <nocturne7> thank you
[01:45:46] <natrixnatrix89> Hi guys.. Is there any way to prevent jquery from binding the used DOM object to a callback function's 'this'?
[01:45:46] <natrixnatrix89> Or is this the only way: $('.my_object').click(my_function.bind(this)) ?
[01:47:58] <natrixnatrix89> what I don't like about my_function.bind(this). is that it doesn't actually my_function().. because bind() creates a new function with a specified 'this'
[01:49:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: it sends a part of the JSON file
[01:49:40] <natrixnatrix89> Sorry. I meant handler.. instead of callback..
[01:51:40] <natrixnatrix89> is it .on() or .delegate() that I'm looking for?
[01:51:49] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: bind only works in a few browsers you shouldn't use it
[01:52:11] <natrixnatrix89> I know.. But I could simply add it's functionality with a polyfill
[01:52:27] <Cork> when you create a function this will always change
[01:52:31] <Cork> thats just how js works
[01:52:43] <Cork> ?.proxy @ natrixnatrix89
[01:52:49] <natrixnatrix89> hmm
[01:52:55] <Cork> damn bot...
[01:52:55] <natrixnatrix89> isn't it just the same as bind?
[01:53:04] <Cork> bind is the same as click
[01:53:11] <natrixnatrix89> I know
[01:53:25] <pandu101> guys, really stupid quesion but oh well. How do i include a jquery plugin in my jquery file?
[01:53:25] <Cork> proxy is a wrapper that uses bind if it exists
[01:53:34] <Cork> (the native function bind that is)
[01:53:40] <iSeeDeadPixels> pandu101: include it to your html
[01:53:53] <iSeeDeadPixels> s/to/in
[01:54:04] <iSeeDeadPixels> just like you include the jQuery library
[01:54:08] <pandu101> but then when i use the plugin command in my jquery file, it does not recognize it and gives errors...
[01:54:12] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: but variables that you want to share cross functions should never be this
[01:54:15] <natrixnatrix89> right.. Simply what I want to achieve is have some sort of oop. so that when my element is clicked.. the 'this' of the function would be my object.. not dom object
[01:54:20] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: store them in another variable
[01:54:40] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: that would be unintuitive
[01:54:53] <Cork> cause in jquery thats always the second variable to the function
[01:55:04] <iSeeDeadPixels> pandu101: remember html parses from the first to last line, put the jQuery library at the top of your <script> list, and your own code at the bottom of your <script> list.\
[01:55:07] <Cork> function(event, related_object) {}
[01:55:20] <natrixnatrix89> hmm. that might work.
[01:55:32] <pandu101> iSeeDeadPixels: hmmm... maybe that was the issue. okay lemme try that. thanks
[01:55:58] <Cork> or simply var related_object = this; $(...).click(function() { related_object });
[01:56:06] <natrixnatrix89> Cork: but still nope.. because the handler is a function inside my class..
[01:56:19] <mazzachre> Apparently jqueryui.resizable does not like box-sizing: border-box;
[01:56:31] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: thats not really how js works
[01:56:46] <natrixnatrix89> but your examples would work.. I guess I'll stick to something similar..
[01:56:53] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: you're trying to apply java logics or c++ logics on javascript
[01:56:55] <natrixnatrix89> Previously I was using bind and it worked.
[01:57:01] <natrixnatrix89> simply I didn't like it..
[01:57:27] <natrixnatrix89> because it creates a new function..
[01:57:44] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: it will do that even if you use bind
[01:57:49] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/ Just a demonstation... I also have another problem, but I will try and recreate it first... (Replacing the element when I start to resize, no idea why...)
[01:57:55] <Cork> that just use call(other_varable_as_thid)
[01:58:19] <natrixnatrix89> So in your example in each $().bind I have to use an anonymous function to bind to my object..
[01:58:23] <Sandra> Is it possible to have a change() event triggered when the input is in an iframe?
[01:58:43] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: ya, that or proxy
[01:58:58] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[01:59:20] <natrixnatrix89> well yeah.. proxy is quite similar to .bind();
[01:59:41] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: $().bind != (function(){}).bind
[01:59:52] <natrixnatrix89> lol. of course :D
[02:00:08] <Cork> so no proxy isn't similar to bind
[02:00:11] <Cork> cause it won't crash on ie
[02:00:35] <Cork> but it will use variable bind in browsers that support it
[02:00:58] <lazaros> hello, i have loaded content into a page using php include, how can i reload that included file through jquery after a certain action
[02:01:12] <Cork> lazaros: you can't
[02:01:23] <Cork> you have to make an ajax call to that php file over the net
[02:01:35] <Cork> and then replace the content of an element in the dom with the response
[02:01:42] <Cork> simplest through .load('url')
[02:01:58] <lazaros> can you guide me to any tutorial ?
[02:02:03] <lazaros> or point me
[02:02:32] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[02:02:37] <natrixnatrix89> Cork: but if I added a .bind polyfill, it wouldn't crash ie either..
[02:02:54] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: you mean add a function for bind on Function?
[02:03:07] <natrixnatrix89> yes
[02:03:17] <Cork> that risks making ie leak though
[02:03:43] <natrixnatrix89> ok. let's just trust $.proxy() then..
[02:04:07] <Cork> and why add a polly fill when there's already a polyfill when there's already one in the librarly you're using?
[02:04:18] <Cork> uh...
[02:04:28] <Cork> * and why add a pollyfill when there's already a polyfill in the librarly you're using?
[02:04:31] <natrixnatrix89> ok. you're right.
[02:05:39] <natrixnatrix89> The answer to my initial question is that I can't really expect jquery to behave like C
[02:11:02] <Cork> natrixnatrix89: exactly
[02:11:04] <Cork> cause its not
[02:11:27] <Cork> s/jquery/javascript/
[02:11:43] <Cork> jquery isn't the cause for this, its just how javascript works
[02:15:40] <iSeeDeadPixels> pandu101: did it work?
[02:16:08] <pandu101> iSeeDeadPixels: yes it did! :) thanks man!
[02:17:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> pandu101: move your script list from the <head> to before the </body> tag, it must be the last lines before it, that way you'll speed up page loading ;)
[02:17:38] <lazyfingers> hello. is it possible to fire an event once some element appears in the document? for example, an element is added dynamically via ajax call
[02:18:06] <pandu101> iSeeDeadPixels: cool tip. i'll try it out. u guys are so helpful in making jquery even more awesome
[02:18:08] <lazyfingers> say, I want to adjust size once my calendar is loaded (html injected from ajax call)
[02:18:39] <iSeeDeadPixels> pandu101: no problemo ;)
[02:19:07] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: i'm still googling and StackOverflowing for the issue with my JSON file..
[02:24:53] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: how big is the json file (in bytes or similar)
[02:25:55] <BinaryKitten> lazyfingers unfortunately no
[02:26:12] <BinaryKitten> but you can get a callback when the data is returned
[02:26:22] <BinaryKitten> which you can then fire the event from
[02:28:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: 86.016 bytes
[02:29:11] <Cork> that shouldn't be a problem at all
[02:29:35] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: do you see the entire response in the net-tab in you're developer console ?
[02:30:14] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: no, it suddenly ends
[02:30:24] <iSeeDeadPixels> every time at the same place
[02:30:32] <Cork> you're sure you're server actually sends the entire string?
[02:30:51] <Cork> cause if its like that in the developer console the browser never gets the rest of it
[02:31:04] <Cork> uh...
[02:31:08] <Cork> *you're sure your server
[02:31:37] <mazzachre> Any explanation for this? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/1/ Why do I need to add 2 and 5 pixels to width and height, in order to keep the bottom right pixel in the same place?
[02:32:15] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: when i open the url "regularly" it does show the whole file
[02:33:02] <Cork> does your server difference between what content-type the client requests?
[02:33:12] <Cork> cause if you open it in a tab it will request text/html
[02:33:26] <Cork> while .getJSON will request application/json
[02:34:12] <SpacePoet> is there any good onnline resource for learning jquery???
[02:34:56] <Cork> mazzachre: outerXxxx(true)
[02:35:16] <LloydK> SpacePoet: Google :)
[02:35:23] <Cork> SpacePoet: the doc.jquery.com and api.jquery.com is quite good
[02:36:14] <LloydK> yeh, StackOverflow for everything else :)
[02:36:32] <Cork> stackoverflow has its up's and downs
[02:36:51] <Cork> theres quite a lot of bad advices there too
[02:39:07] <noregret> I have a [object HTMLDivElement] how can I convert it to a string ?
[02:39:46] <Cork> $('<div/>'),html(varaible).html()
[02:39:54] <Cork> *variable
[02:40:11] <Cork> hmm
[02:40:13] <Cork> no
[02:40:29] <Cork> $('<div/>'),html(varaible.clone()).html()
[02:40:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: may i pm you as this issue is working with private commercial data?
[02:41:31] <Cork> ok
[02:42:48] <noregret> Cork: there is nothing to select here, the object is simple called htmlobj
[02:43:11] <Cork> noregret: exactly
[02:43:17] <Cork> $('<div/>'),html(htmlobj.clone()).html()
[02:44:51] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: i pm'ed you
[02:45:13] <iSeeDeadPixels> also, shouldn't that , be a .
[02:45:45] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: you're json is invalid
[02:46:45] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: since when? O.o
[02:46:52] <Cork> i donno
[02:46:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> i've ran it through jsonlint
[02:46:57] <iSeeDeadPixels> it's valid
[02:47:26] <Cork> ah
[02:47:36] <Cork> no you're sending json to a jsonp call
[02:47:46] <Cork> you can't do that
[02:47:47] <iSeeDeadPixels> that syntax error is due to not completely downloading the file
[02:47:57] <Cork> no is due to not beeing jsonp
[02:48:25] <mazzachre> Cork?
[02:48:25] <Cork> jsonp expects to get a javascript file that calls the function jquery sends it
[02:48:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> oh
[02:49:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> how else would i get the JSON from there and use it "locally" ?
[02:49:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> loading the contents into a javascirpt var?
[02:49:29] <Cork> hmm
[02:49:51] <Cork> i can see it in the cosole so let me test a bit
[02:50:01] <finnnnnnnnnnn> can I trigger a custom event on one elemant and catch it with another? http://jsfiddle.net/vHnHT/
[02:50:20] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: do you have an url where it can be seen thats on the same domain?
[02:50:30] <iSeeDeadPixels> it's cross domain..
[02:50:32] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: cause i see the complete json just fine here
[02:50:41] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: so it really should be jsonp?
[02:50:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> and i only have the files locally
[02:50:54] <mazzachre> Cork: No, even outerXxx(true) does not return the original size of the element... It works if I remove box-sizing, but then my calculations get to be a lot more difficult...
[02:51:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> yeah, i think, because the json is feeded from an API server
[02:51:29] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: you can't send json cross domain in all browser
[02:51:37] <Cork> you can in modern ones (-ie)
[02:51:49] <Cork> but then you need to set a header on the api server
[02:51:52] <sunbeam> whats the best function to search for elements within $(this) ?
[02:51:58] <sunbeam> h4, img etc
[02:52:05] <Cork> sunbeam: .find
[02:52:19] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTTP_access_control
[02:52:24] <iSeeDeadPixels> ugh, so much hassle..
[02:52:38] <Cork> iSeeDeadPixels: but the best option is prob to either proxy it over the local domain
[02:52:41] <Cork> or use jsonp
[02:53:15] <Cork> but only use jsonp from the remote site if you 100% trust them, cause they do get execution rights on your site
[02:53:20] <noregret> anybody used https://github.com/padolsey/prettyPrint.js before? i'm having an issue where a value is not fully displayed e.g. a val has "2d8600805c560e9095087c3c0ea129fb6c271b98dfb7dbde3d88048bdd3fc3ae" and is displayed as "2d8600805c560e9095087c3c0ea129fb6c271b9..." any ideas ?
[02:55:09] <iSeeDeadPixels> Cork: is there no way to download the contents into a var?
[02:55:16] <Cork> no
[02:55:18] <iSeeDeadPixels> like PHP's file_get_contents?
[02:55:31] <Cork> that is what i meant with proxy it over your domain
[02:56:01] <Cork> <?php echo file_get_contents('url'); ?>
[02:56:14] <sunbeam> thanks Cork
[02:57:00] <mazzachre> noregret: Something have been set to overflow: hidden and text-overflow to ellipsis or something?

[03:03:25] <Cork> i think there are web sites that does that
[03:04:31] <mikecmpbll> if I have multiple of the same form on a page, and the form controls are jqueryized [sic], what's the best pattern to ensure my controls only affect the form i'm acting on?
[03:04:43] <rosieres> I have a ajax page. On click in MenuÂ´s the content is loaded by ajax. I deliver some inline css and js in ajax head. but the js is not executed. any ideas ?
[03:05:19] <Cork> mikecmpbll: what controls are you talking about?
[03:05:27] <Cork> buttons or input elements?
[03:05:40] <mikecmpbll> input stuff mainly
[03:05:50] <Cork> rosieres: ajax can't have html, head or body tags
[03:05:53] <Cork> that would be invalid
[03:06:21] <mikecmpbll> essentially i've got a namespacing issue, i suppose.
[03:06:29] <Cork> mikecmpbll: and you want to relate them to elements on the same form?
[03:06:55] <Cork> mikecmpbll: make the script none intrusive, and base it on classes you add for the functionality
[03:07:06] <Cork> mikecmpbll: then it shold work just fine
[03:07:11] <mikecmpbll> the problem i'm having is that i had a working form, and now I have two of those forms, and acting on one form affects the other, and visa versa
[03:07:20] <Cork> $(this).closest('form').find() if you need to find other elements
[03:07:21] <finnnnnnnnnnn> can anyone tell me why this - https://gist.github.com/661855 is better than doing something like this '$(document).on('/some/topic', function(params) { ... });'  - '$(document).trigger('/some/topic', { stuff: here })'
[03:07:34] <mikecmpbll> i see.
[03:07:51] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: answer to your earlier question http://jsfiddle.net/vHnHT/1/
[03:07:57] <mikecmpbll> thanks:)
[03:07:59] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Cork:  thanks
[03:08:02] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: and in the future stick around a bit longer when you ask a question
[03:08:09] <finnnnnnnnnnn> sry, dodgy connection
[03:08:56] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Cork: I'm struggling trying to find a decent way of pub/sub with js. you have any advice?
[03:09:00] <rosieres> cork: must correct myself: itÂ´s not delivered in head. the script is appended . . . .
[03:09:20] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: the way you did it there should work well
[03:09:31] <finnnnnnnnnnn> cool, will do. thanks
[03:10:11] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: if will trigger the event on every event listener bound with that name; period
[03:10:16] <Cork> no matter on what element
[03:10:32] <finnnnnnnnnnn> yep, that's what I want
[03:10:47] <Cork> rosieres: and what you send is a html fragment, not a full html page?
[03:11:04] <rosieres> cork:yes
[03:11:39] <Cork> rosieres: does the js expect to be in relation to the html code?
[03:11:59] <Cork> that is does the js depend on legacy things like document.write or things like that
[03:14:31] <rosieres> Cork: it just  calls a .live submit and .live click  depending on an id which is within the fragment
[03:17:22] <Cork> you prob shouldn't use live if you call it from the html you add
[03:18:05] <rosieres> Cork: whatÂ´s more sinful ?
[03:18:26] <Cork> live will live even when you remove the code or replace it
[03:18:46] <Cork> so if you call live on the same selector twice it will have two listeners
[03:19:06] <rosieres> Ok . And whatÂ´s more useful ?
[03:19:07] <Cork> additionally, .live is depricated you should be using .delegate or .on (in delegate mode)
[03:19:24] <Cork> rosieres: it depends on how you're page work
[03:19:43] <Cork> if you want to to stick around for the length of the pages existence
[03:19:50] <Cork> just load it statically when the page loads
[03:20:08] <Cork> if you want to rebind it each time the fragment is loaded just use normal bind/on
[03:20:58] <rosieres> Cork: Seems that I have to rewrite some stuff then .... thanks
[03:21:45] <mazzachre> I try again... Why is the initial console output 18 (element height) and then after resize the element height is 16? I can fix it by changing the box-sizing, but that is kind of strange?

[03:56:57] <Croves> Hello everyone! I'm having a very strange problem. I have a file that checks in my DB if the code (passed by GET variable) is already in my database. The PHP Side it's ok, but when I try to do it with jQuery, I have no answer =(
[03:57:03] <Croves> Here is my jQuery code: http://pastebin.com/stW85sGD
[03:57:30] <jessica_> cusco , got my problem
[03:57:31] <anew> cusco yes
[03:58:03] <cusco> Croves: can you see console.log()'s output as expected?
[03:58:39] <Croves> cusco, The firebug displays a red line "GET http://hospitalcenter.com.br/verifica_fornecedor.php?cnpj=07.998.549/0001-66 200 OK", but if you click in the "Response" tab, it's empty
[03:58:45] <cusco> Croves: you can also var_dump($_GET); in php (and then die(); ) to see the whole parameters you're requesting
[03:59:03] <cusco> Croves: but the console.log() shows anything?
[03:59:09] <cusco> in the console?
[03:59:18] <mazzachre> Any ideas on what to do about this? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/3/ (Resizing leaves the element with a different height)
[03:59:24] <Croves> cusco, no, only this information
[03:59:33] <cusco> jessica_: I guess you're missing some code, try and read their examples. Also you may care to paste YOUR code for us to see....
[04:00:08] <cusco> Croves: try debug on php side if you're getting the $_GET variables right, as in var_dump($_GET)
[04:00:47] <jessica_> http://pastebin.com/PVzuXheq
[04:01:00] <Croves> cusco, Yeah... I'm pretty sure my PHP is working fine. If I access the URL directly by browser, I can get the information that I need
[04:01:34] <Croves> cusco, Take a look by yourself. Access  http://hospitalcenter.com.br/verifica_fornecedor.php?cnpj=07.998.549/0001-66
[04:01:53] <Croves> If it returns zero, that means this code is available to use. Else, no

[04:04:12] <NET||abu1e> hi folks,, have a weird situation, unfortunately have an old project using jquery 1.5.2, i tried updating to 1.8.3 but there's incompatabilities..
[04:04:21] <NET||abu1e> the slider we have is failing on just ie7 and 8
[04:04:26] <NET||abu1e> ie 9 firefox and chrome is all fine
[04:04:50] <NET||abu1e> seems that the slide event is trying to assign a textnode value to the input field the slider is hooked to
[04:05:38] <NET||abu1e> so this is InputElement and elem is TextNode, the line is this.appendChild(elem);   and the exception is "unexpected call to method or property access."
[04:06:54] <NET||abu1e> on jquery-1.5.2.js line 5148
[04:07:16] <NET||abu1e> basically the jquery.append() method.
[04:07:38] <wolfehr> is there a way to enforce clicking on a top level element that has children with handlers bound to click events doesn't allow the click to bubble down (e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault don't stop events that are directly bound to those child elements, so is the only way to create an element with 0 opacity, position it in front and prevent it that way?)
[04:08:49] <wolfehr> altneratively, I guess I could iterate through and unbind the click event from the children
[04:09:20] <NET||abu1e> wolfehr: does return false; not stop any further events from taking place?
[04:09:36] <NET||abu1e> the docs say the two methods you mention should prevent it but.... hmmk,
[04:09:54] <NET||abu1e> so e.stopPropagation(); should do it..
[04:10:14] <wolfehr> that's what I thought as well
[04:10:18] <granden_> Hi, anyone here who have used highcharts?

[04:15:54] <Croves> What could it be?
[04:16:58] <NodeX> Croves: It means somehting is not wokring
[04:17:10] <Croves> no shit, sherlock! lol
[04:19:04] <NodeX> Oh hold on, I have the answer
[04:19:13] <NodeX> it's broken and needs fixing :)
[04:20:07] <Hans_Henrik> sounds like that answer could be used to almost any question with "whats wrong with this code?"
[04:20:28] <Hans_Henrik> "why doesnt this work?"
[04:21:20] <rosieres> Cork: beside the fact that you were right about the live function I did get it to work with pushing my js fragment as an child to the head which made it work for me . . .

[05:09:11] <lazaros> hello, i have included a php page <?php include file.php ?> i want this page to update after an event, i tried jQuery(".slide-right").load("http://www.domain.com/somedirectory/data.php"); but it doesnt work
[05:20:02] <DarsVaeda> hey, in a json like for a get, is it better to wrap an index in quotes or just without?
[05:25:05] <lazaros> is this wrong ? .load('http://www.domain.com/wp-content/themes/themename/data.php');
[05:26:51] <sunbeam> $(this).find("img").attr("src")
[05:27:01] <sunbeam> this will give me the whole element riught? AND not the value of src
[05:29:14] <lazaros> var src = $img.attr("src"); will give you value of src
[05:29:34] <lazaros> you can chose the image through var src = $img.attr("src");
[05:29:41] <lazaros> oops
[05:29:42] <lazaros> var $img = $("#someImage");
[05:29:44] <sunbeam> but i need to find
[05:29:57] <lazaros> this way it will look for an image in that div
[05:30:23] <lazaros> you can combine them
[05:30:40] <sunbeam> how do you mean?
[05:30:42] <sunbeam> dont understand
[05:30:53] <DarsVaeda> what do you want to do
[05:31:17] <Cork> sunbeam: how many img elements do you have in the current element?
[05:31:34] <Cork> if you don't have more then one $(this).find("img").attr("src") shold work just fine
[05:31:57] <Cork> (and you would get the src string not the element)
[05:32:19] <DarsVaeda> shouldn't it be .prop("src") now?
[05:32:26] <Cork> depends
[05:32:33] <Cork> prop will get normalized attr won't
[05:33:22] <Cork> <img src="image.png"> .attr('src') == 'image.png'; prop('src') == 'http://example.com/full/path/image.png'
[05:33:51] <sunbeam> Cork: 1
[05:34:03] <sunbeam> strange
[05:34:04] <Cork> sunbeam: then ya your selector should work just fine
[05:34:05] <sunbeam> will check
[05:34:32] <Cork> attr/prop will grab the value from the first element in the list if you have many
[05:34:48] <Cork> so you should always get something unless there is no img elements :)
[05:35:21] <noregret> I have a string with "<sendto@mail.com>" and when appending it, it doesn't print anything.. since it's consdering it as an html tag, how can i print/decodeit ?
[05:35:38] <Cork> .text(string)
[05:36:04] <Cork> else you would have to encode it
[05:36:37] <noregret> Cork: I am concatenating it to another var, such as var block = a + text
[05:37:17] <fRAiLtY-> Could anyone point out anywhere obvious this script could be minified or made more lightweight? http://jsfiddle.net/SkJFZ/ It works it's just ugly
[05:37:31] <noregret> Cork: so should i encode it? and by using what ?
[05:37:58] <ruby_on_tails> anyone here uses an online editor ? like cloud9 ?

[05:38:29] <Cork> hmm no thats for url
[05:38:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/SkJFZ/1/ DOES THIS WORK FOR YOU?
[05:38:36] <iSeeDeadPixels> oops caps XD
[05:39:09] <fanz0r> what does the [object Object] error means :(
[05:39:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: that it's a objech
[05:39:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> object*
[05:39:39] <noregret> Cork: well, i want it be displayed correctly and not encoded, if possible
[05:39:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> access it's values by object.key
[05:39:54] <fRAiLtY-> iSeeDeadPixels:  Lol, not quite what I meant :D
[05:40:28] <fanz0r> yeah but i'm parsing a sub array to handlebars and when looping through it gives me <li>[object Object]</li>
[05:40:46] <Cork> noregret: $j("<div/>").text(string).html() is the best i can think of
[05:40:56] <Cork> noregret: there isn't really any direct functions for it
[05:41:18] <fanz0r> my code goes like var context = $.getJSON('http://googlecalendar api stuff')
[05:41:34] <fanz0r> and i'm trying to get the array "items"
[05:41:43] <fanz0r> and for each item get the "summary" key
[05:42:01] <fanz0r> and its cracking me up :E
[05:42:16] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/vytKu/
[05:42:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> that's my code working with a object
[05:42:31] <noregret> Cork: cool, that worked out, thanks
[05:42:36] <iSeeDeadPixels> see what i've done? :)
[05:42:51] <fanz0r> the data[index] ?
[05:43:21] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: just the whole line
[05:43:31] <fanz0r> wait i'm going to give u a jsfiddle, looking at your code now
[05:43:38] <VictorCL> I am trying to disable the loading of links trhough ajax , but I cant seem to make it work
[05:43:39] <iSeeDeadPixels> sure.
[05:43:44] <VictorCL> it keps loading all the link in ajax anyway
[05:43:57] <iSeeDeadPixels> normally it's array[key] right? objects work like object.key
[05:44:51] <Cork> fanz0r: the other party expects to get a string
[05:45:02] <Cork> and you're sending an array or an object
[05:45:23] <Cork> so it does {}.toString() (thats just how js works)
[05:45:23] <fanz0r> yeah but doing .toString(), doesnt quite work
[05:45:25] <fanz0r> amirite
[05:45:43] <Cork> what is in the array?
[05:45:49] <Cork> or what it is
[05:45:53] <fanz0r> Wait, i'm setting a jsfiddle
[05:45:59] <iSeeDeadPixels> cork, rather ask what his input is...
[05:46:07] <iSeeDeadPixels> google api stuff sounds like json.
[05:46:16] <Cork> no its not
[05:47:39] <iSeeDeadPixels> he obv. retreives json
[05:47:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> if he's using getJSON
[05:49:22] <fanz0r> http://jsfiddle.net/3gBBu/1/
[05:49:28] <fanz0r> here u go
[05:49:40] <fanz0r> if you uncomment my second "context" var it works
[05:49:54] <fanz0r> if i directly use it on a $.getJSON it doesn't
[05:50:04] <fanz0r> so i can't wrap my head around this
[05:52:03] <lazaros> jQuery('#loading-content').html(''); i want to include a php file in there, how can i do that ?
[05:52:28] <AL13N_work> what's the best way to pass a variable from one jquery handler to a subhandler?
[05:53:25] <fanz0r> iseedeadpixels: any insight ?

[05:55:11] <AL13N_work> var foo = 5; $("bar").trigger('bar', [function (e, data) {  var p = foo + 3; }, extra]);
[05:57:06] <fanz0r> iseedeadpixels: i also tried context.responseText, but it doesn't seem to work either
[05:58:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: http://jsfiddle.net/3gBBu/2/ check the console ;)
[06:00:21] <fanz0r> iseedeadpixels: all i get is "5k38tlrmsdcdjk8p0as3dumod0"
[06:01:09] <iSeeDeadPixels> indeed
[06:01:29] <iSeeDeadPixels> the ID of the first item
[06:01:59] <fanz0r> i may sound stupid here but i don't quite get it sir
[06:02:39] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: i'm not going to spoonfeed you, use the information i gave you to learn what i did, and continue on your solution from there
[06:02:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> look at the json file you get from google, and look at that piece of code.
[06:05:10] <fanz0r> iseeDeadPixels well thanks i think i almost see what u did there, you took data, then the first element of the item array and echoed the id of that first element
[06:06:30] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: exactly
[06:06:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> array[key] and object.key is the difference ;)
[06:07:15] <fanz0r> But this is what , if i am not mistaken, i am already doing with my handlebars template (atleasy im supposed to)
[06:07:56] <fanz0r> when i do {{#each items}}<li> {{ this.summary}}</li> {{/each}}
[06:08:55] <fanz0r> wich is equivalent to context.items[loop here through IDs].summary
[06:09:15] <fanz0r> But thanks anyways you helped me atleast understand the error
[06:10:42] <AL13N_work> how can i pass this variable so it's known in the trigger statement inside the foo handler: http://jsfiddle.net/x9s7m/
[06:13:57] <shoky> AL13N_work: pass what variable?
[06:16:45] <Wh1tebird> Hello, I seem to have a problem. Anyone want to help? When using JqueryUI to autocomplete a textbox with data given over a json url, it always shows all options, instead of the ones suggested according to the textbox characters. The website his hosted here : https://subversion.khk.be/projecten/TI_1213project16/cursusbeheer/cursusbeheer.php/user/register (The textbox labeled "gemeente")
[06:16:55] <Wh1tebird> This is my Json data stream https://subversion.khk.be/projecten/TI_1213project16/cursusbeheer/cursusbeheer.php/gemeente/allenamen
[06:20:06] <shoky> Wh1tebird: when using remote data you need to do the filtering yourself. see http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[06:20:46] <Wh1tebird> Thank you shoky, will start reading, what I don't get is that in my examples in class, it does work the way i do it. I'll link to an example in a second.
[06:22:37] <fanz0r> iSeeDeadPixels: can you give this a try ? pretty please ? http://jsfiddle.net/wilhearts/JjK7v/
[06:22:44] <sunbeam> if($(".view-select-tabs a").is("#list-view")) {}
[06:22:47] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this?
[06:22:53] <sunbeam> i want to check if it has the id
[06:22:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> fanz0r: sorry i'm at work :C
[06:23:15] <shoky> fanz0r: val is an object. console.log it
[06:23:22] <shoky> ?ftj @ fanz0r
[06:23:40] <fanz0r> iseedeaspixels: thanks nvm :)
[06:23:52] <fanz0r> shoky, okay
[06:24:03] <Jac0bz1> I'm using the datepicker. But it dont seem to angnoledge the default value of the input field (2012-12-14). I've set the format to yy-mm-dd and everything works after i've clicked and choose a date and it produce the same format YYYY-MM-DD
[06:24:38] <hlve> Jac0bz1, #jqueryui
[06:24:43] <hlve> er
[06:24:50] <hlve> is there not a jqueryui channel?
[06:24:51] <hlve> lol
[06:24:53] <shoky> ..

[06:25:37] <hlve> IT IS 9:25AM SIR :P
[06:25:47] <shoky> 4:25pm biatch
[06:25:58] <fanz0r> shoky, yeah it seems to be the same object i'm looping through, wtf :(
[06:26:15] <shoky> fanz0r  you're not looping through an object, you're looping through an array
[06:26:22] <shoky> fanz0r: an array of objects ;]
[06:26:36] <fanz0r> i just want to get the Title of each calendar event in <li> tags
[06:26:49] <fanz0r> why is jquery killing kittens every second i reload my browser ?
[06:27:11] <shoky> what's the name of the title field..
[06:27:14] <shoky> i only see "summary"
[06:27:23] <shoky> for that do.. val.summary
[06:27:53] <fanz0r> shoky, man, that worked
[06:27:56] <fanz0r> stupid ass me
[06:29:20] <fanz0r> shoky, thanks alot
[06:34:20] <AL13N_work> shoky: as you can see, there's a trigger of results2 in a anonymous function that's passed as an argument to a function, that function will be called back later as a result of ajax... so the 'page' variable is a problem... http://jsfiddle.net/x9s7m/
[06:35:44] <shoky> AL13N_work: what's the problem?
[06:41:13] <JenniferB> Hi folks, if I have an object: var obj1 = { val1 : 1, obj2 : { val1 : this.val1 } } ... how can I refer to the val1 in obj1 from nested obj2 _

[06:43:48] <Flayks> Hello! i saerch to make a quizz with 2 answers. One is good, and i need to select the opposite answer for the other question. You have an idea? http://jsfiddle.net/dPPGX/
[06:45:05] <Asone> Ohai people
[06:45:42] <Asone> does anybody knows if there's a another way to write this ?
[06:45:43] <Asone> this.el.onclick = function(e){ /* do stuff */ }.bind(this);
[06:48:32] <AL13N_work> shoky: well, twice is there this line: $("#t").trigger('results2', page);
[06:48:48] <shoky> AL13N_work: so?
[06:48:54] <AL13N_work> shoky: but the first, as you can see is inside an anonymous function and this page isn't usable there
[06:49:01] <AL13N_work> *thus
[06:49:07] <Wh1tebird> Thank you shoky, i solved it
[06:49:07] <shoky> isn't usable? how so
[06:49:29] <AL13N_work> well, it's not in the local context and page isn't a global variable
[06:49:50] <shoky> it's in the local context of  .bind("results", function (e, page) {
[06:49:54] <shoky> that handler function
[06:50:00] <AL13N_work> yes
[06:50:12] <shoky> it's accessible from any inner function too
[06:50:30] <AL13N_work> but since the anonymous function can be executed later (due to ajax) it's possible that it's been overwritten by another trigger
[06:50:46] <AL13N_work> or not?
[06:50:48] <shoky> no
[06:51:01] <shoky> another trigger would be a new call to that handler function
[06:51:05] <shoky> with a new local context
[06:51:47] <AL13N_work> so the local context of these functions are new for each trigger, even for other anonymous functions defined there?
[06:52:05] <shoky> yeah
[06:52:07] <AL13N_work> so those page variables are still local but will be different?
[06:52:15] <AL13N_work> it's a bit odd to grasp if you ask me
[06:52:17] <shoky> yep
[06:52:29] <AL13N_work> i'll take your word for it, thanks
[06:56:11] <shoky> don't take my work for it, see for yourself ;p
[06:56:18] <shoky> word*

[07:09:21] <Cristen> Hi everyone, I have a product list, each time I click on a product it sends an ajax request and updates a cookie. When I try to display that cookie on the next page the values are wrong, it only changes for the first call. However If I click on the back button and repeat the steps and choose multiple other products for example this time it works as expected. Thanks in advance for the help guys.
[07:11:54] <NoiseEee> why do you need to use ajax to set a cookie?
[07:12:59] <Cristen> because I'm interacting with a 3D applet, and I don't want the user to reload the page each time he desires to view another product
[07:14:05] <NoiseEee> so you mean you're loading product information in via ajax?
[07:14:26] <Cristen> exactly
[07:15:00] <NoiseEee> well you're going to have to show some code online, preferably in a jsfiddle and try to reproduce the problem
[07:17:04] <Cristen> that would be difficult to reproduce, it's part of a framework I don't think I'm able to reproduce my controllers behaviors in jsfiddle but thanks anyway
[07:17:39] <NoiseEee> well nobody here has a crystal ball
[07:17:56] <NoiseEee> but maybe you can try to help yourself... http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[07:26:05] <Cristen> Well the code doesn't work on jsfiddle but here it is : http://jsfiddle.net/krgPE/
[07:27:00] <NoiseEee> there's just not enough info there
[07:27:10] <NoiseEee> try debugging, ie: that link above
[07:27:57] <Cristen> I'll give it a try
[07:28:14] <Ansikt> How do I find the closest children?
[07:28:33] <Ansikt> Or, closest child.  Just like .closest() but going down.
[07:32:09] <johnkpaul> Ansikt: .children().first()
[07:32:30] <Ansikt> Awesome, thanks.
[07:34:47] <flayks> hello!

[07:40:01] <Chris_CC> Hi guys i have a problem. When i try to add a <select> entity via jquery, it always closes the </select> tag before adding the <option>'s any idea why?
[07:45:59] <NoiseEee> Chris_CC: presumably because you are adding the element.  just append <options> to it before or after you put it in the DOM
[07:46:10] <NoiseEee> or create a string if that seems sensible
[07:46:29] <Chris_CC> NoiseEee: Yes, I want to create a whole new <select> drop down input that is not there unles you press a button
[07:46:29] <NoiseEee> $('#div').html('<select><option>etc</option></select>');
[07:46:51] <NoiseEee> Chris_CC: then create it first via jquery dom/append methods, and put it in the document
[07:47:17] <Chris_CC> I'm creating via this $('#location_user').replaceWith(data); .. should i convert the data toa  string?? I;m still new
[07:47:49] <NoiseEee> well whats data
[07:47:55] <NoiseEee> im guessing just a <select>
[07:47:59] <Chris_CC> i'l setup a pastebin :)
[07:49:43] <Cristen> NoiseEee I debugged the Jquery, I tried to click on 3 products and logged the self::$cookie->productId value, starts at 29 becomes 70 and then 71 as it should 3xhr requests are made as expected. And then I go to the next page and var_dump(self::$cookie) : it reads 29.
[07:52:42] <Chris_CC> NoiseEee: Here's a part of it, should have everything, but there is more http://pastebin.com/ddLmHUxq
[07:53:15] <NoiseEee> that's php dude
[07:53:49] <Chris_CC> NoiseEee: ahh ... is the problem not the jquery bit? where it;s returning the data?
[07:53:49] <NoiseEee> i see you making <options> but no select
[07:54:12] <Chris_CC> line.28 for select
[07:54:15] <NoiseEee> i have no idea what inc_form_select_location.php does
[07:54:30] <Chris_CC> the bit //php is that include
[07:54:44] <NoiseEee> well you should look at a what is getting returned
[07:54:54] <shoky> Chris_CC: you have:   <select class='location' id="country" name="country"/>
[07:54:58] <NoiseEee> what is your ajax returning?  proper code?  any <options> at all?
[07:55:00] <shoky> you're closing the <select> tag with that slash
[07:55:20] <Chris_CC> shoky: you;re a star!
[07:55:31] <Chris_CC> thanks both fo your for taking the time to check it :)
[07:55:41] <shoky> ;p
[07:56:15] <Chris_CC> that's what happens when you try to learn html,jquery,css,php and mysql at the same time :P
[07:56:25] <Chris_CC> can't see obvious mistakes :(

[08:21:47] <phiofn> noo
[08:21:57] <phiofn> it is about careers in computer science
[08:22:01] <phiofn> i have just graduated
[08:22:04] <phiofn> and have 2 options
[08:22:06] <hlve> then it isn't a question for #jquery

[08:22:25] <phiofn> hlve, ok... thanks
[08:25:49] <aqeel> do you know where can i get community help for developing the plugins
[08:41:34] <Pritchard> Hi.  I'm using jQuery Mobile in combination with ASP.NET MVC.  I had an ID parameter attached to my URLs, but when AJAX is enabled on jQuery mobile forms, the resulting url is "/controller/action" instead of "/controller/action/id".  Is there any way to circumvent this?
[08:43:23] <Pritchard> Turning off AJAX retains the ID in the URL.  We like the AJAX form submissions, but losing that ID breaks $.back() functionality and eliminates our RESTful URLs.
[08:47:58] <Pritchard> So essentially, I'd be happy if I could add a parameter to my jQuery Mobile forms telling it what page to redirect to after the form submits.
[08:48:23] <Absolute0> Is there a 'drag' mouse event? Implementing it via mousedown,mousemove,mouseup is very tedious.
[08:48:42] <is_null> Pritchard: <input type="hidden" name="next" value="/next/url/" />
[08:49:07] <is_null> this should be usable on both server and client side
[08:49:10] <sunbeam> if($(".view-select-tabs a").is("#list-view")) {}
[08:49:12] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this?
[08:49:13] <sunbeam> i want to check if it has the id
[08:49:30] <Pritchard> is_null:  Thanks.  Let me try that.
[08:50:45] <inad922> hello
[08:51:00] <inad922> If I have a jquery object how can I get it's last child?
[08:53:35] <Pritchard> is_null:  <input type="hidden" name="next" value="/TestController/TestAction/3" /> still redirected to /TestController/TestAction.  Am I missing something?
[08:54:26] <shoky> sunbeam: it's not wrong
[08:55:18] <shoky> sunbeam: it'll return true if any one of '.view-select-tabs a' is the element with that id
[08:55:43] <systemfault> I didn't know that :/
[08:56:00] <systemfault> I would have expected that it returns true or false for the first element
[08:56:55] <shoky> ya it's a bit odd
[08:57:04] <sunbeam> shoky: strange, its returns true on both
[08:57:14] <shoky> both what
[08:57:42] <sunbeam> nvm shoky

[09:10:43] <Francexi> Hi everyone
[09:10:55] <aqeel> Flayks: jslint it it stops at 17% scan, your code has errors
[09:11:48] <Francexi> anyone can ask to a simple questions about the submit() function?
[09:12:05] <Francexi> or better, method
[09:12:51] <Flayks> aqeel, hm yes but i don't think it's why the code doesn't work ?
[09:13:29] <aqeel> for anyone to guide you, need to have minimal erors or functional code
[09:13:38] <Flayks> aqeel, http://jsfiddle.net/Flayks/nDPTc/2/
[09:13:50] <Flayks> (just ; and ,â€¦ not important)
[09:14:06] <Francexi> i have a form with two submit button
[09:14:17] <Francexi> i triggered it with the submit() method
[09:14:36] <Francexi> but event.target identify the form
[09:14:54] <Francexi> and i wnat to know whixh button is pressed
[09:15:15] <Francexi> (event is the object passed as argument to the handler)
[09:16:00] <Francexi> aqeel , you was talking to me before?
[09:16:57] <aqeel> sorry nit you but Flayks
[09:17:02] <systemfault> Francexi: For some weird reason... jQuery loves playing with the "this" of the handlers... so try using "this"
[09:17:02] <aqeel> not*
[09:17:30] <Francexi> systemfault "this" is the body element
[09:18:06] <systemfault> Ahhhh, I haven't read what you said at the beginning
[09:18:31] <Flayks> aqeel: i think i need a bahviour like a "local" variable for each link
[09:18:48] <Flayks> but i don't know how to do thatâ€¦
[09:19:05] <Flayks> behaviour*
[09:19:13] <Francexi> so, systemafault, is there a method to obtain which button is pressed?
[09:19:16] <aqeel> no need to var for each link, each() is for that purpose
[09:19:42] <Flayks> ok
[09:21:17] <Francexi> so, systemfault, is there a method to obtain which button is pressed?(sorry the double message, i've missed your name)
[09:23:47] <systemfault> Francexi: From javascript or serverside?
[09:23:54] <Francexi> javascript
[09:25:01] <systemfault> I think you'll have no other choice than cheating a bit... You could add a event handler on your submit buttons that would add... let's say.. an attribute on the form element and you could access that attribute from within the submit handler.
[09:25:19] <systemfault> s/event handler/click event handler
[09:26:07] <Francexi> it's the only method?
[09:26:08] <Flayks> aqeel: do you have an idea?
[09:26:28] <aqeel> still looking into your coe
[09:26:50] <Flayks> ok! thx
[09:33:17] <aqeel>  cl = $t.attr("class").split("r ")[1]
[09:33:27] <aqeel> what is[1] for
[09:33:31] <imsky> what are u guise talking about
[09:33:49] <Flayks> because my links has class="r f" or class="r t"
[09:33:54] <Flayks> where f = false and t = true
[09:33:56] <aqeel> if you put 0 it works for all, every single line
[09:34:28] <Flayks> yes but i need to select the crosswise answer on click
[09:35:27] <Flayks> aqeel: check my example: http://jsfiddle.net/Flayks/nDPTc/3/
[09:35:29] <Flayks> the behavior is good here, but only for the question 1
[09:35:32] <mobile8> http://pastebin.com/zscF29mx, i'd like to clone this array (2 of this in the code) {} 10 more times, whats the easiest way to do this?
[09:36:00] <Flayks> when i click on an answer, i'm don't able to click to another answer of the same question
[09:36:23] <Flayks> that's why i have a quizz_click var
[09:37:08] <Flayks> but for the next question, it broke the code because it's 1
[09:37:49] <Flayks> and if i set quizz_click to 0 avter the next function, it will work with ALL questions and not only the next
[09:38:14] <Flayks> this is why i talk about a "local" variable for each question
[09:38:44] <Flayks> do you the problem aqeel ?
[09:39:46] <aqeel> well you need to add incrementing into array as question is solved and go on until the last question is answered
[09:40:00] <Flayks> yes, that's it!
[09:49:55] <aqeel> ?array
[09:51:16] <aqeel> Flayks: i have got to go......at jquery.com.......documentation search array and make use of those commands
[09:51:42] <Flayks> haha, thank youâ€¦

[10:27:22] <tomoyuki28jp> Eviltwin: that works with JQM too?
[10:27:28] <Eviltwin> No idea
[10:27:36] <tomoyuki28jp> Eviltwin: thank

[10:50:16] <lasha> Does anyone know of IRC rooms for accessibility?
[10:51:02] <zeropx> Defining query variables I have always used var foo = $('.bar'); pattern. I have noticed a few projects I have worked that define theirs using  $foo = $('.bar'); pattern. Aside from knowing that $foo is a an obvious jquery cached object, is there any other general benefits from defining variables with $ preceding?
[10:51:23] <shoky> zeropx: none
[10:51:31] <zeropx> dang auto correct kept fixing the word jquery on me to query
[10:52:02] <zeropx> shoky: thanks, I figured there wasn't.
[10:52:10] <lasha> zeropx: exactly at shoky said, zero benefit other than to help the coder know what's what.
[10:52:28] <zeropx> lasha: yeah, I find it ugly personally.
[10:52:45] <lasha> zeropx: really? I kinda actually like it.
[10:52:54] <lasha> it's like shorthand selections :D
[10:53:11] <zeropx> lasha: I live in PHP for the most part, so when I get to do JS, I don't like having memories for some reason. :D
[10:53:42] <lasha> zeropx: haha, makes sense.
[10:53:52] <lasha> JS having php-like variables :D
[10:53:53] <zeropx> Overall it feels cleaner with out the prepended $ in front of stuff too to me.
[10:54:15] <zeropx> lasha: yeah it hurts my mind.
[10:54:21] <lasha> cleaner is one thing, but a visual aid to let you know whether it's a jquery object or not can be helpful down the line
[10:54:31] <lasha> when you don't remember exactly what's what after going back to a porject
[10:55:16] <zeropx> That is true. Generally though most of what I code makes senseâ€¦ to me that is. If something is an object or other.
[10:56:11] <zeropx> This guy happened to define ALL variables with it sadly. Strings, ints, arrays etc.
[10:56:53] <lasha> lmao, ok that's just silly.
[10:57:13] <lasha> even if you GET an integer from a jquery selection, it shouldn't have a $
[10:57:27] <lasha> like $("div").length
[10:57:35] <zeropx> yeah exactly.
[10:57:50] <lasha> i wouldn't put a $ for a var name that CONTAINS an integer as an end result lol
[10:57:54] <jtm> Why can't I pass in "this" into a function from inside an event?
[10:57:55] <zeropx> I am refactoring the code now to be a bit more visually aesthetic and understanding.
[10:58:07] <jtm> When I do the function doesn't behave properly
[10:58:21] <zeropx> jtm: can you provide a sample of your code on pastie.org or something?
[10:59:40] <jtm> http://pastie.org/private/yhjn22i7ytvi3xlpmiifga
[11:00:19] <jtm> http://pastie.org/private/dldxaj6rvnxkagwltrfow  (with JS selected)
[11:00:54] <jtm> This works if I take the inside of setupGroup and put them into the click function
[11:02:21] <zeropx> jtm: when passing this you should pass it $(this)
[11:02:32] <zeropx> or
[11:02:45] <zeropx> no or, nm
[11:02:48] <Qbix1> hey guys
[11:02:53] <Qbix1> how do I play a facebook video in my site?
[11:02:56] <Qbix1> I got the src via their website
[11:03:01] <lasha> you COULD pass $(this) if you wanted.
[11:03:10] <jtm> I was passing in "this" without $()
[11:03:16] <lasha> yea
[11:03:19] <lasha> that SHOULD work....
[11:03:25] <jtm> but...
[11:03:32] <jtm> Those already go into a $()
[11:04:00] <jtm> $(groupInput)
[11:04:04] <shoky> jtm: that snippet is fine.. (except maybe for not having 'var' in the first 3 lines of setupGroup() )
[11:04:16] <shoky> jtm: what does "the function doesn't behave properly" mean?
[11:04:33] <lasha> what shoky said!
[11:04:53] <jtm> I'm not exactly sure, it just behaves strangely. Like if I click an input it adds the same label
[11:05:13] <shoky> ?ftj @ jtm
[11:05:13] <bot-t> jtm, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[11:05:15] <shoky> enjoy.
[11:05:21] <Edico1> hi
[11:05:27] <jtm> so lets say there are 4 inputs:  1 2 3 4   Normally if I select all 4, I get 1,2,3,4.  But if I put it like this I get 1,1,1,1
[11:05:31] <jtm> or 2,2,2,2
[11:06:08] <shoky> jtm: read through that link. then if you still cant get it, make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[11:06:23] <jtm> ok
[11:09:11] <lasha> here look
[11:09:14] <lasha> i basically did what you did
[11:09:21] <lasha> in my jsfiddle and it works fine
[11:09:21] <lasha> http://jsfiddle.net/Hvkmn/
[11:09:54] <lasha> (open console to see results)
[11:10:10] <jtm> yeah I'm thinking it's a scoping issue.
[11:11:07] <shoky> console.log and the debugger are your friends
[11:12:13] <monstordh> how do i completely remove a link from a group of text?
[11:13:13] <lasha> there's a function to strip tags
[11:13:28] <lasha> at least in PHP. i am POSITIVE there is a JS solution. i've seen it
[11:16:44] <Saaether> monstordh http://jsfiddle.net/3y9wB/
[11:17:21] <monstordh> Saaether: thanks. i also just found this and it seems like it will work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601903/jquery-almost-equivalent-of-phps-strip-tags
[11:17:39] <monstordh> if i target properly
[11:22:36] <exit2> Can someone see why my shallow copy is not working correctly? http://pastie.org/5531832
[11:24:36] <jtm> So the issue is:     $checkedInputs.each(function() { selectedValues.push($.trim($(groupInput).parent().text())); }); based off my previous pastie.
[11:24:58] <jtm> It seems the .each is reporting the same element every time
[11:24:59] <jtm> OH
[11:25:03] <jtm> It should be this :)
[11:25:21] <jtm> Thanks guys! :)
[11:32:24] <hugo_moss> anybody here use fancybox? ive tested fancybox, its a nice plugin, but when it fades in, it flickers.
[11:32:40] <hugo_moss> is it just my computer, or has anybody experienced it as well?
[11:33:53] <lasha> a flicker? never experienced that.
[11:34:06] <eikonos> i haven't seen fancybox flicker. it could be you. try another browser to test if it's browser-specific
[11:36:31] <hugo_moss> the webpages that i see use fancybox always change from a dark background to a little bit lighter dark background, and no flickering
[11:36:36] <hugo_moss> but if the page starts off completely white
[11:36:42] <hugo_moss> and fades to black, theres flickering
[11:36:57] <hugo_moss> let me test another browser
[11:38:21] <hugo_moss> http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ <---- flickers, click on one of the examples, the background is very light, and it goes to dark,
[11:38:58] <hugo_moss> when you close the modal window, you can see the flicker
[11:39:59] <hugo_moss> it doesn't flicker when you click the picture because its not fading in, but when you close it, it fades and flickers
[11:40:03] <bil`> If I trigger a custom event:  $.event.trigger({type:"targetSetListChange"})        do I need a selector to setup the listener or can I just do $.on('targetSetListChange' â€¦) and have it implied ?
[11:42:32] <hugo_moss> eikonos: you try it?
[11:43:02] <eikonos> i'll check in a moment
[11:43:07] <hugo_moss> k thanks
[11:46:45] <eikonos> is there one link in particular that flickers? i check a bunch of them and can't find it
[11:47:39] <hugo_moss> in the examples
[11:47:41] <hugo_moss> the first example
[11:47:44] <hugo_moss> with the blue sky
[11:47:47] <hugo_moss> and field
[11:47:51] <hugo_moss> yellow field
[11:47:55] <hugo_moss> when you click it
[11:48:05] <hugo_moss> it wont flicker, but when you close it, watch it as it fades out
[11:48:06] <hlve> Hey guys, kinda stuck with this json issue I'm having whenever I try to post specific data. It's hitting a 500. My sup. told me that the content type needs to be application/json, but whenever I set contentType: application/json, the json no longer posts at all...
[11:48:59] <eikonos> hugo_moss: it doesn't seem to flicker here
[11:49:02] <lasha> hlve: show code please
[11:49:07] <hugo_moss> weird
[11:49:07] <hlve> Lasha. one sec.
[11:49:48] <hugo_moss> its like a rectangular burst, a line shows up in the middle, and then dissolves, but its only for a split second
[11:50:00] <hugo_moss> what kind of setup do you have?
[11:50:06] <eikonos> safari on a mac
[11:50:11] <hugo_moss> ahh mac
[11:50:14] <hugo_moss> im using windows
[11:50:20] <Absolute0> Why is my free-hand drawing off by an inch? http://jsfiddle.net/urwb5/ (click to draw in the box)
[11:50:21] <ericw> http://pastebin.com/N5iaaqXd
[11:50:30] <hugo_moss> windows 7,
[11:50:30] <hlve> Lasha: http://pastebin.com/mwNb85G5
[11:50:36] <ericw> can someone help me figure out why this isn't ie compatible?
[11:51:42] <hlve> Lasha, as you can see, I've commented ou the contentType, but when I remove the //'s, it doesn't post at all. No error. Just doesn't post.
[11:52:21] <kam187-rMBP> hey guys
[11:52:35] <kam187-rMBP> got a weird issue with jq mobile
[11:52:53] <kam187-rMBP> there apears to be extra white space after the content
[11:53:22] <hlve> kam187-rMBP, read the topic. show us the code.
[11:53:35] <hlve> we can't debug what we can't see.
[11:53:36] <kam187-rMBP> it happens with any page code on an iphone
[11:53:39] <lasha> hlve: so your error function doesn't execute?
[11:53:49] <kam187-rMBP> it must be a css issue
[11:53:54] <hlve> lasha, correct. it's strange.
[11:53:55] <Absolute0> Cleaned up: http://jsfiddle.net/urwb5/5/
[11:54:50] <lasha> hlve: are you expecting json to be returned from the server?
[11:55:16] <hlve> lasha, correction. the error function is executing. sorry, I wasn't paying attention. ;\
[11:55:20] <hlve> I'm expecting a 200.
[12:01:49] <styol> Heylo. Any random ideas why $.post() would be sending its request as the GET method as opposed to POST? I'm a bit baffled. I am using $('mahform').serialize(); to provide the data, but that seems to be in the docs as an example and shouldn't be the issue. I'm guessing I can force it with violence and $.ajax(), but more just curious at this point.
[12:02:51] <bil`> styol: have you touched ajaxSettings()
[12:03:00] <styol> bil`: negatory
[12:03:10] <bil`> then the only answer is unicorns.. sorry man
[12:03:31] <fakingfantastic> Having a brain laps, is there an opposite method to not() ?
[12:03:32] <styol> damn rainbow farters, always getting in my sauce
[12:03:40] <fakingfantastic> like $("img").only(".foo")
[12:03:46] <bil`> fakingfantastic: has()
[12:03:53] <fakingfantastic> bil`: thanks man
[12:04:01] <MistuhKurtz> fakingfantastic, is()
[12:04:02] <bil`> er actually
[12:04:08] <bil`> has returns true/false
[12:04:13] <bil`> my bad
[12:05:07] <bil`> you might want filter()
[12:05:23] <MistuhKurtz> bil`, is()
[12:05:37] <MistuhKurtz> filter does not return bool, it returns a the jquery collection filtered with the selector passed to it
[12:05:50] <fakingfantastic> MistuhKurtz: thats what I need, thanks
[12:06:03] <MistuhKurtz> yerp
[12:07:11] <jacoluta> any1 here use sublime text 2?
[12:07:47] <bil`> jacoluta: yes
[12:08:02] <jacoluta> do you know how to tab a line regardless of cursor position?
[12:08:17] <bil`> cmd+]
[12:08:32] <jacoluta> awesome thank you
[12:09:01] <jacoluta> oh lol i guess i knew that
[12:09:06] <jacoluta> i usually just highlight the line
[12:09:11] <jacoluta> guess you dont need to highlight
[12:09:14] <jacoluta> THANKS AGAIN
[12:09:39] <bil`> you're welcome, thanks for visiting #sublimetext :P
[12:10:54] <jacoluta> bil`: haha assumed there wasnt a channel
[12:16:52] <Godd2> Is there a page I can read on this channel's etiquitte and rules?
[12:17:41] <skqr> http://9gag.com/gag/4909569
[12:17:46] <catcher> Godd2, if you don't paste a bunch of code and ask questions relevant to jquery, you'll be fine :)
[12:18:17] <Godd2> okay, thanks, catcher :)
[12:24:35] <hlve> oh jquery
[12:24:37] <hlve> you're gunna be my demise
[12:24:47] <hlve> =[
[12:28:25] <styol> bil`: ohemgeeâ€¦ $.ajax() is doing the same shit also
[12:31:01] <Godd2> If I have a vairable "count" that Im using to identify tags that jquery is embedding for me, how do I concatenate the count variable when Im trying to refence a tag? I tried $('embed.manual' + count) but that doesn't seem to work...
[12:32:27] <bil`> styol: How are you termining that $.post() and $.ajax() are using GET
[12:32:43] <bil`> determining*
[12:32:52] <styol> bil`: the end point has a check for the request being a post method and it is output GET as opposed to POST
[12:32:58] <styol> *outputting
[12:33:08] <catcher> Godd2, you want a concatenated string?
[12:33:16] <bil`> have you looked in the developer console inside your browser
[12:33:28] <bil`> the end point being the backend?
[12:33:29] <fakingfantastic> anyone notice that if you resize an image in Safari, it like "refreshes" the image quality a second after resizing? Any way to prevent that, or something lol
[12:34:26] <Godd2> catcher: yes, I have a tag of class "manual##" where ## is being set by count the previous round. and Im trying to reference the tag I hav jquery just create.  Should I make a jsfiddle?
[12:35:08] <Godd2> had jquery*
[12:35:33] <styol> Godd2: var count = 123; $('embed.manual' + count)â€¦ should work in that scenario, checked to make sure count is what you expect it to be and that embed.manual123 is the correct element?
[12:36:31] <catcher> Godd2, please do
[12:36:44] <Godd2> http://jsfiddle.net/KpJX2/
[12:37:10] <Godd2> It's creating <embed class="manual1"> correctly
[12:37:17] <Godd2> and all the other numbers
[12:37:52] <catcher> Godd2, you need to change the class property
[12:39:01] <catcher> .removeClass(), .addClass();
[12:39:38] <puchacz> hi, I would like to start writing a json interface to my server side app. how can I test it?
[12:39:44] <Godd2> oh you mean instead of relying on append to write out the html?
[12:40:04] <catcher> Godd2, if you're trying to change the classname, yes
[12:40:24] <catcher> unless I'm misunderstanding the goal..
[12:40:51] <puchacz> shall I write a simple web application that can talk to every publicised json function and re-publish them in a very simple webpage?
[12:41:09] <Godd2> puchacz: If you're running PHP, the json_decode function may be helpful: http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php
[12:41:56] <Godd2> unless you meant more structured testing
[12:41:58] <puchacz> Godd2: I mean something like interactive console that can talk to my server
[12:42:11] <puchacz> so I can call functions
[12:42:37] <Godd2> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/ ?
[12:42:44] <catcher> Godd2, can you paste the markup too?
[12:42:53] <Godd2> catcher: sure
[12:42:55] <andrew9184> http://jsfiddle.net/nyF2y/1/
[12:42:59] <andrew9184> how do i get sayHello to run ?
[12:43:06] <styol> bil`: whoops, i missed your responses. Good call, unicorns indeed. Coming out the browser as POST and ending up as GET on the backend. I suspect magic.
[12:43:22] <MistuhKurtz> puchacz, what's your server-side stack?
[12:43:24] <puchacz> Godd2: ok, maybe I will use firefox console
[12:43:32] <Godd2> catcher: http://jsfiddle.net/CSCsJ/
[12:43:40] <bil`> styol: yeah then prob a backend issue
[12:43:48] <puchacz> MistuhKurtz: lisp
[12:44:03] <puchacz> serverside is fine, I have library to encode and decode json values
[12:44:03] <MistuhKurtz> oh. totally unfamiliar with that one. heh
[12:44:07] <Godd2> catcher: Im really just trying to get it to play an mp3 on a key press and then delete the ebmed tag it created
[12:44:12] <puchacz> I just need to call them
[12:44:35] <puchacz> simulating the client I mean
[12:44:52] <styol> bil`: yup yup, bizarro.. I have previously tested this with POST requests which was the apparently incorrect assumption to operate off of. Well, thanks dood :)
[12:45:34] <MistuhKurtz> puchacz, do you mean a console that you type a command into?
[12:45:45] <puchacz> MistuhKurtz: yes
[12:46:07] <puchacz> MistuhKurtz: I have no problem with server side, I have a problem how to test it interactively pretending to be a client
[12:46:36] <Godd2> puchacz: You want users to be able to look at json files?
[12:46:54] <puchacz> just me now
[12:47:00] <puchacz> (hold on, one sec)
[12:47:28] <Godd2> well personally I would decode the json serverside and then shove the result in a <pre> tag
[12:53:02] <styol> bil`: yeah, the request url has get variables in it, so that must be causing itâ€¦ not sure how it worked before from a different interface but that is besides the point
[12:55:23] <catcher> Godd2, maybe create the markup outside of the append..
[12:55:58] <catcher> Godd2,   var markup = "<embed class=\"manual"+count+"\" src=\"horse.mp3\"></embed>";     jQuery('body').append(markup);
[12:55:59] <Godd2> catcher: mmk, Im new to jquery, so Ill mess around with it.  Thanks :)
[13:01:23] <bil`> considering the all the extra helper stuff jquery has you think it'd include some basic templating
[13:01:44] <min|dvir|us-work> bil`: http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[13:01:59] <bil`> hasnt that project been suspended
[13:02:15] <bil`> i just use mustache + a jq mustache plugin
[13:03:21] <styol> mustache++
[13:03:46] <min|dvir|us-work> I like Hogan.
[13:04:15] <tripflex> handlebarzzzz
[13:04:22] <bil`> https://github.com/jonnyreeves/jquery-Mustache  <-pretty cool plugin for mustache. it can async load html template files
[13:04:53] <hlve> shoky, I NEED DAT HALP
[13:05:18] <bil`> i think handlebars and icanhaz allow you to declare template sin side your html document, but don't allow the async fetching of them
[13:05:21] <Flayks> Heyp! just a questionâ€¦ Easy to say but so hard to do for me : how to permit just one answer choice per question? if you choose TRUE from question 1 choice 1, you can select also FALSEâ€¦ i search to avoid this http://jsfiddle.net/Flayks/nDPTc/
[13:05:41] <hlve> Say I have: data: { "seatCount": EntUpdatedSeatCnt },  ... my post is returning "seatCount=19" ... and my content type is application/json. My Ajax posts with success, no problem.
[13:06:18] <hlve> I need to have my post actually be posting back "  { "seatCount" : "19" }   "
[13:06:24] <hlve> how do I get it to format like that
[13:06:29] <hlve> and still remain application/json.
[13:06:36] <bil`> Flayks: you spelled quiz wrong is that the issue? :P
[13:06:51] <Flayks> bil`: nop haha :p
[13:07:10] <Flayks> bil`: but answer all possibilities to a question is too easy i think :x
[13:07:34] <hlve> Anyone?
[13:07:36] <hlve> \;
[13:08:22] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: use dataType.
[13:08:30] <hlve> and set it as what?
[13:08:36] <min|dvir|us-work> 'json'.
[13:08:42] <hlve> It's already set to json
[13:09:12] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: look in your browser network logs.
[13:09:22] <hlve> you're not listening p_p
[13:09:49] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: I understand that from the server side you're getting a query string instead of JSON.
[13:10:02] <hlve> it's getting json.
[13:10:03] <min|dvir|us-work> But you first need to confirm that your client side is sending JSON instead of a query string.
[13:10:19] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: OK, then please explain further.
[13:11:00] <hlve> Okay, so... right now, I have it set to manually set my brackets in place with the following.
[13:11:01] <hlve> var mySeatCountResponse = '{ seatCount: ' + '"' + EntUpdatedSeatCnt + '"' + ' }';
[13:11:10] <Flayks> bil`: (anyway, an idea?)
[13:11:43] <bil`> Flayks: WHy don't you use radio buttons
[13:11:47] <hlve> wait a sec.
[13:12:05] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: that's terrible.
[13:12:05] <hlve> yeah, the content type is getting set to:    Content-Type	application/json; charset=utf-8
[13:12:07] <Flayks> bil`: what about customize radio :s
[13:12:21] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: JSON.stringify({seatCount: 19});
[13:12:29] <hlve> Oh.
[13:12:30] <hlve> LOL
[13:12:32] <hlve> My bad.
[13:13:27] <hlve> One sec. trying that.
[13:14:48] <hlve> min|dvir|us-work, it's still modifying the header content-type to be "Content-Type	application/json; charset=utf-8"
[13:15:02] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: is that not what you want?
[13:15:14] <hlve> I need the content-type to remain just application/json, no charset. it's hitting a 500 whenever I try to post that
[13:15:35] <lasha> i am PRETTY SURE this is a server problem dude
[13:15:36] <lasha> not your problem
[13:15:45] <lasha> please check with the backend people, if there are any
[13:16:03] <min|dvir|us-work> hlve: what's wrong with having charset?
[13:16:30] <hlve> lasha, if it were a server problem, it'd of queried the URL. It doesn't even attempt to query the URL, so the AJAX is erroring out before it attempts to post
[13:16:35] <lasha> there's nothing wrong. if you don't put a charset, the server uses its default setting
[13:16:49] <bil`> Flayks: Don;t have the time to write an example for you, but looking at the code it looks like you've over engineered this a bit. I'd have a container element surrounding both buttons. On click, fetch both buttons and apply a disabled class to the one that wasn't clicked.
[13:17:01] <lasha> hlve: open your network tab in chrome or whatever and see if the page doesn't actually try to send out a query
[13:17:22] <hlve> don't you think I've already done that?
[13:17:22] <hlve> lol
[13:17:29] <Flayks> bil`: disable class -_- of course,
[13:17:42] <hlve> it doesn't even attempt the post. It errors out before posting
[13:18:21] <Flayks> why i don't think earlier haha
[13:19:47] <lasha> what's the error it throws?
[13:20:01] <lasha> my bad for asking obvious questions
[13:21:22] <hlve> lol it's cool. I've been at this all day.
[13:21:37] <hlve> I've never debugged errors specifically. What would I put in the error function to debug this?
[13:21:38] <lasha> can you paste the error you get?
[13:21:54] <lasha> have something like this....
[13:21:55] <hlve> It's hitting the error function. Which just alerts ('error');
[13:22:24] <lasha> error: function(data){ console.log(data) }
[13:22:33] <lasha> don't use alert()
[13:22:57] <lasha> and then look in console to see the returned message from the server
[13:23:48] <jtm> Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'prop'   What exactly does this mean?
[13:24:07] <jtm> I used .prop on an Object of HTMLInputElement, doesn't that have properties?
[13:24:24] <jtm> I also tried .attr
[13:24:36] <systemfault> jtm: Don't call jQuery methods on a DOM node..
[13:25:04] <jtm> Got it
[13:25:07] <jtm> $(this) :)
[13:36:12] <shoky> hlve wut
[13:36:30] <Qbix1> anyone here?
[13:37:01] <hlve> lasha, you still here?
[13:37:12] * shoky slaps hlve around a bit with a wakeboard
[13:37:16] <hlve> hlve, hi you.
[13:37:32] <hlve> one sec. I'll post my code so maybe you can halp me.
[13:37:33] <shoky> o.O
[13:37:48] <lasha> yea i'm here hlve
[13:38:47] <hlve> Okay, so here's the deal.
[13:38:47] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/wTvBx8Pw
[13:39:17] <hlve> When I try to post, I'm hitting error. The console states that it's a 405 NetworkError "Method Not Allowed", however in my network tab, no URL is being queried.
[13:39:22] <hlve> So the URL never attempts to post
[13:40:33] <hlve> when I change data to: data: {seatcount: EntUpdatedSeatCnt}, instead of calling the variable mySeatCountResponse
[13:40:54] <hlve> The URL queries but i'm getting a 500
[13:41:42] <hlve> er, wait  that's a little wrong actually. I'm getting a 200 on that change, when I change the data to {seatCount: mySeatCountResponse},
[13:41:48] <hlve> so it posts he data
[13:42:06] <shoky> hlve: do that and remove the contentType
[13:42:18] <shoky> hlve: what does the server expect..
[13:42:35] <hlve> do without the data change, or with?
[13:42:36] <shoky> not a regular POST?
[13:42:39] <shoky> with
[13:43:20] <hlve> Okay, so that gets a 200
[13:43:25] <shoky> k
[13:43:27] <hlve> but it formats it as "seatCount=20"
[13:43:39] <hlve> instead of {seatCount : "20"}
[13:43:41] <shoky> for what data?
[13:43:54] <shoky> and that's wrong?
[13:44:21] <hlve> yes. It needs to be formatted as JSON when it posts. So serverside should be receiving {seatCount : "20"}, and not seatCount=20
[13:44:36] <hlve> which is why I had the var mySeatCountResponse = JSON.stringify({ seatCount: EntUpdatedSeatCnt });   up above
[13:45:56] <hlve> My sup. told me needs to be formatted like that in order for his API to properly handle it. He's not willing to budge... so I'm kinda forced to figure it out
[13:46:50] <shoky> well i dont really understand why you were getting that 405 NetworkError
[13:47:09] <shoky> contentType: 'application/json'   and  data: JSON.stringify(...)   should work fine
[13:47:15] <shoky> and send the request
[13:47:15] <hlve> That's the thing that's baffling us. In console it was logging as the 405 NetworkError, but in the network tab, no queries were even being made.
[13:50:44] <hlve> Would there be any reason why a networkerror would show up in console, but not in the net tab?
[13:51:02] <shoky> what happens if you try chrome
[13:51:26] <hlve> trying
[13:51:27] <hlve> one sec.
[13:52:30] <hlve> shoky, it's showing in console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load
[13:52:44] <hlve> blah blah blah. is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[13:53:06] <shoky> oh
[13:53:13] <shoky> it's a different domain?
[13:53:27] <shoky> hlve
[13:53:39] <hlve> yeah, we're testing it on our production box, to an api on the development server
[13:53:44] <shoky> duh..
[13:53:57] <shoky> then you need CORS or JSONP
[13:54:08] <shoky> well, no you need CORS
[13:54:20] <shoky> if you wanna send that data with the request
[13:54:27] <shoky> enable CORS on your server
[13:55:36] <shoky> either that or a serverside proxy
[13:55:55] <JFranks> Is it me, or is jQuery causing me to neglect learning proper CSS syntax/declarations ? $("table.initial tr td:first-child").css('text-align', 'right');
[13:56:00] <hlve> Hmm
[13:56:16] <min|dvir|us-work> JFranks: best to use classes.
[13:56:54] <hlve> shoky, I'm checking but I'm pretty sure we already had CORS enabled on the server.
[13:56:59] <JFranks> Yeah.. I was looking at that going.. Brother would that suck for someone with zero JS skill to sort out.. :p
[13:57:05] <shoky> hlve:  <hlve> blah blah blah. is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[13:57:12] <shoky> that means it's not enabled or not properly configured
[13:57:33] <shoky> hlve: check the headers the server responds with
[14:01:19] <hlve> But why would that only happen if the contentType is listed?
[14:01:20] <firstclassfunc> how can I search for an id that has a space in int?
[14:01:59] <shoky> hlve what happens if you remove the contentType
[14:02:06] <hlve> i'm getting a 500 error
[14:02:11] <hlve> internal server error
[14:02:16] <hlve> not method not allowed
[14:03:07] <shoky> hlve: with what data?
[14:03:15] <hlve>  data: JSON.stringify({ seatCount: EntUpdatedSeatCnt }),
[14:03:29] <shoky> chrome too?
[14:03:38] <hlve> chrome is still showing that access-control-allow-origin error
[14:03:43] <shoky> yeah..
[14:03:45] <hlve> firefox shows the 500 though
[14:04:13] <shoky> one or both of them are fucking up :P
[14:04:22] <shoky> or.. no idea :D
[14:04:36] <shoky> im used to chrome
[14:04:36] <hlve> ;P
[14:04:45] <shoky> so my guess would be that CORS isn't properly enabled still
[14:04:54] <hlve> But typically the access-control-allow-origin means CORS isn't enabled?
[14:05:00] <shoky> no idea why firefox lets it go through.. if it does
[14:05:03] <shoky> yes
[14:05:12] <hlve> Firefox lets it go through, but hits a 500 error.
[14:05:14] <hlve> So it can't post.
[14:05:21] <hlve> it really doesn't make any sense
[14:05:31] <shoky> well it makes sense that its a 500
[14:05:36] <shoky> if it goes through without the contentType
[14:05:44] <shoky> you're sending JSON without a json content-type
[14:06:09] <hlve> but that's the thing. It's hittinga  500 when I remove the contentType
[14:06:12] <hlve> (in firefox)
[14:06:15] <shoky> that's what i said
[14:06:20] <hlve> Ah
[14:06:21] <shoky> you're sending JSON without a JSON content-type
[14:06:29] <shoky> so it errors :S
[14:06:39] <hlve> but why doesn't chrome hit a 500?
[14:06:48] <hlve> or does it silently, and outputs the allow-origin error?
[14:06:52] <shoky> my question was: why does firefox let it go through
[14:06:57] <shoky> which is the inverse q ;]
[14:07:07] <shoky> cause i am under the assumption that firefox is the one fucking up ;p
[14:07:29] <hlve> Hmm ;[
[14:07:42] <shoky> and under this assumption, chrome doesnt hit a 500 because its doing the right thing and blocking the request
[14:07:51] <vrlogrs> hey guys
[14:07:58] <hlve> but one thing that I don't understand
[14:08:02] <vrlogrs> im getting a very dumb error that i cant seem to figure out
[14:08:10] <vrlogrs> Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[14:08:21] <shoky> vrlogrs: did you copy & paste from jsfiddle :P
[14:08:26] <vrlogrs> yah :S
[14:08:28] <shoky> :)
[14:08:37] <shoky> there's an invalid character at the end, sometimes its invisible
[14:08:45] <vrlogrs> oh ..
[14:08:47] <hlve> is if I just set my data to: data: { "seatCount": EntUpdatedSeatCnt }, without the contentType set. Chrome and firefox both 200's the request and it succeeds.
[14:08:47] <hlve> fadslknfasln
[14:09:05] <hlve> it truly doesn't make sense.
[14:09:06] <hlve> lol
[14:09:26] <shoky> hlve: oh chrome gets 200 too?
[14:09:36] <shoky> hlve: still cross-domain requesT?
[14:09:39] <hlve> yes
[14:09:43] <hlve> let me triple check to make sure
[14:09:44] <hlve> but yes.
[14:09:49] <lasha> fucking invalid characters
[14:10:06] <hlve> yep
[14:10:16] <hlve> 200's that data string. But 500's the other.
[14:10:25] <hlve> So CORS being disabled/enabled shouldn't be the case here.
[14:10:33] <vrlogrs> thanks shoky - it worked :)
[14:10:56] <shoky> hlve: i dunno.. try pastebinning a session of requests/responses from chrome network tab  (pastebin the request/response headers)
[14:11:01] <shoky> maybe there'll be a clue..
[14:15:00] <Desode> Can I ask really stupid questions here too? (this one excluded)
[14:15:48] <shoky> anything but that one
[14:17:23] <vrlogrs> guys, if you have a minute to help me ...
[14:17:41] <vrlogrs> http://www.funnode.com/ --- at the top of the page, when you hover on the logo
[14:17:56] <vrlogrs> i want to have that navigation slideout and hide when hover out
[14:18:10] <vrlogrs> and hover in should have it slide in from the left
[14:18:29] <vrlogrs> like, it should disappear and appear as it slides out and in
[14:19:58] <Desode> I'd like to have a  div (div1) that -when clicked-  makes another div (div2) visible.  Then upon the second click (div1)  the second div (div 2) should become invisible again. Additionally, all clicks outside of (div2) should make it invisible. What I found was http://jsfiddle.net/ePdmx/ but that toggles visibility when clicked anywhere
[14:20:52] <vrlogrs> does that make sense to anyone? :S
[14:21:54] <Whirl3d> does anyone know of a contact form written in jquery that allows users to use facebook, twitter, google, or to manually enter a return email address?
[14:26:18] <shoky> Desode: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Mq3WH/
[14:26:44] <Desode> shoky thanks a bunch!   Is there a place where these things get stored btw?
[14:26:50] <shoky> Desode: oops, http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Mq3WH/1/
[14:26:57] <shoky> Desode: what do you mean?
[14:27:28] <Desode> Maybe a library of code snippets with some attached  text on what they do for  searching purposes?
[14:27:46] <Whirl3d> Like a best of jsfiddle. LOL
[14:28:13] <shoky> Desode: there are many code snippets with attached text in http://api.jquery.com
[14:28:23] <Desode> Exactly Whirl3d :)
[14:28:26] <shoky> Desode: the fiddle i linked you to.. i just made
[14:28:52] <Desode> It seems to solve my issue, I'll  try to implement it. Thanks a bunch!
[14:29:49] <shoky> sup Whirl3d
[14:30:20] <Whirl3d> shoky! Doing everyone's work for them again, huh? So sweet you are.
[14:30:54] <Whirl3d> Just learning WordPress and hating it!
[14:30:58] <shoky> anything to not have to do my own work!
[14:31:22] <Desode> Whirl3d,  That's why I skipped wordpress and went for Drupal instead
[14:32:01] <shoky> heh i dont think i'd ever get along with any of these .. systems.. that want to.. manage.. my .. content
[14:32:21] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I would too. The only thing is that they just released 3.5 and had over a million downloads in the first 24 hours. WordPress is taking over
[14:33:25] <Desode> If you see people updating websites with Windows Commander, a CMS system might not be a bad idea hehe
[14:34:55] <Whirl3d> WordPress is trying to bill itself as a CMS now.
[14:35:07] <dogarrhea> hehe really?
[14:35:12] <shoky> hasn't it been doing that for a while
[14:35:39] <Desode> It used to be called blog software, no?
[14:35:57] <shoky> ya
[14:35:57] <Whirl3d> Yeah. But with the creator being the editor of Wired, it's really gaining traction.
[14:36:53] <Whirl3d> At least half of my clients have suddenly decided they need a WordPress site. That and a Tumblr site.
[14:37:16] <vrlogrs> ok .. i almost got it: http://www.funnode.com/
[14:37:21] <vrlogrs> please, if some1 has a minute
[14:37:30] <vrlogrs> the navigation div on top of the page
[14:37:57] <vrlogrs> right now the height is causing problems during the slide in and out
[14:38:03] <vrlogrs> how would i fix that? :S
[14:38:42] <Whirl3d> set your css to overflow:hidden on the text elements to keep them from wrapping
[14:39:01] <vrlogrs> i have set div#nagivation to overflow: hidden
[14:40:04] <Whirl3d> set your menu items class to display:inline-block; ?
[14:40:32] <catcher> white-space: nowrap on #navigation would do it
[14:41:12] <vrlogrs> yes catcher - it worked
[14:41:15] <vrlogrs> thanks guys! :D
[14:41:23] <catcher> np
[14:41:48] <Whirl3d> right on, I have never use white-space before
[14:43:13] <Whirl3d> So I have to make a contact form that allows people to autoFill their name and email address with data from Twitter, Google, or Facebook. Any ideas how I can go about this?
[14:44:44] <Desode> What will the form be a part of Whirl3d?  will it be completely stand-alone?
[14:45:40] <Whirl3d> I guess it should be. Technically it is going to be a WordPress widget, but I probably want it more versatile.
[14:46:13] <Desode> if it's a wordpress widget, it already exists does it not?
[14:46:24] <Desode> you can login using openauth
[14:46:35] <Desode> and then have wp prepopulate those fields
[14:47:15] <Whirl3d> To be honest, I can't stand WordPress and I plan to just use the loop and query functions soon.
[14:47:29] <Desode> ah..
[14:47:30] <sayd> could someone give me a tl;dr on how to use noConflict
[14:47:53] <Desode> Well, if you can't figure it out, there's a plugin called 'opauth'  I think, which should fix your hardships
[14:48:10] <Whirl3d> Thanks, I appreciate it.
[14:48:12] <sayd> loading jQuery in a site that I load inside an iframe seems to render my code useless
[14:48:12] <shoky> sayd:  jQuery.noConflict();  jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... your code, can use $ freely ... });
[14:48:22] <Desode> no problem
[14:48:59] <sayd> shoky: and if the code in between the ...'s is referencing jQuery directly?
[14:49:42] <shoky> sayd: that's fine. uhm unless the conflict is between jquery and another jquery ;]
[14:49:55] <Whirl3d> ironically, no WP plugin for OPAuth...
[14:50:05] <shoky> srsly?
[14:50:14] <slash_nick> Most mobile friendly scripts for (1) datepicker, (2) modals/dialog.... ? :)
[14:50:20] <Whirl3d> not from the gitHub repos
[14:50:36] <shoky> http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/oauth
[14:50:37] <sayd> shoky: yea it is ;)
[14:50:38] <Desode> Whirl3d,  it seems WP is using its own names for stuff again... (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/oa-social-login/)  this is what I was referring too. It's also available as a php library on (http://opauth.org/)  And I think it'll save you a LOT of time
[14:50:58] <sayd> whats OPAuth?
[14:51:05] <shoky> sayd: heh... then i think a tl;dr will get you nowhere. go read and play :)
[14:51:08] <slash_nick> OAuth?
[14:51:16] <shoky> what's google?
[14:51:16] <Desode> OPauth on its own is a library for social media logins on websites
[14:51:23] <Desode> it's called different on every damn site it seems
[14:51:50] <sayd> ahh php
[14:52:53] <Whirl3d> Desode, I'm using that already. I don't know how to get it to populate the contact fields, though.
[14:53:14] <slash_nick> No one here has a favorite tool for mobile-friendly modals?
[14:53:44] <Whirl3d> sorry, off-topic anyways. my bad
[14:53:51] <Desode> Like I said, I skipped WP..  in Drupal i'm allowed to use  "Tokens" as default values in fields.  If I set up a contact form, I can just give in "Default values" for each of those fields and add stuff like [user:current_user]
[14:53:58] <Desode> I'm sure this 'll exist for Wordpress too
[14:54:48] <oxfouzer> so I define a .keyup(function(){ }); for an element
[14:54:50] <TelFiRE> Hmm, this is weird, I have a roll-over menu, pretty simple, works almost exactly like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6uhHQ/ -- but that one works great! On my site with the same code, if you mouse over the button, then mouse out of the area quickly before the slidetoggle finishes, then whenever you mouse over the button again it only expands the height of the menu partially (to the part it was at when you rolled off it). Any clues
[14:54:55] <oxfouzer> is there a way to just run it too?
[14:55:05] <oxfouzer> like .keyup(...).trigger() or something?
[14:55:45] <shoky> oxfouzer:  .keyup()
[14:55:48] <oxfouzer> TelFiRE: looks nice. Set a timer on mouseout before hiding it, however.
[14:55:55] <oxfouzer> shoky: HA! yes.
[14:57:24] <TelFiRE> oxfouzer: would that be equivelent to using hoverintent
[14:57:52] <TelFiRE> I want to use HI but my only issue is that the rollover and roll out are both in one function. this seems silly Imo, when would the roll-out area ever be the same as the roll-in area :s
[14:59:09] <oxfouzer> TelFiRE: whuh?
[14:59:21] <shoky> TelFiRE: try .stop(true)
[14:59:31] <TelFiRE> ? what's the true
[14:59:33] <bot-t> TelFiRE, jQuery.extend() - Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[14:59:40] <shoky> ?stop @ TelFiRE
[14:59:41] <bot-t> TelFiRE, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[15:00:58] <TelFiRE> stop(true) didn't change it
[15:02:44] <TelFiRE> oxfouzer: so you are saying after they mouse out it would stay up for a few seconds? I can see why that would be ideal but not really sure how it can help this bug
[15:02:50] <eddiemonge> stop(true, true)
[15:03:20] <shoky> nah that would totally change hte animation
[15:03:48] <TelFiRE> eddiemonge: woot, thanks
[15:03:59] <oxfouzer> TelFiRE: I know nothing about your bug... I just peeked at the fiddle and noticed that I think it should have a delay ;)
[15:04:09] <TelFiRE> oxfouzer: oh ok makes sense :p
[15:04:14] <oxfouzer> becase I overshot the bottom of the menu and it disappeared :P
[15:08:32] <sowemeetagain> Hey guys/gals I have a footer that seems to have gone missing but only on one of my pages. I am using jQuery + Mobile and Dreamweaver, and in Dreamweaver if I look at the document in live view the footer is gone, same in my browser however if I look at it like this: http://i.imgur.com/my3MY.png I can see that my footer is seemingly in the right place before the page is loaded, bringing me here to you guys to see what might be g
[15:09:14] <oxfouzer> sowemeetagain: nothing for ya, sorry
[15:11:19] <sowemeetagain> thanks anyway oxfouzer
[15:11:40] <eddiemonge> sowemeetagain: we need a live example or code
[15:12:25] <sowemeetagain> I can do a live example, if you don't mind connecting via IP as opposed to a URL?
[15:12:35] <oxfouzer> lol
[15:13:12] <oxfouzer> as long as its not rus.sia.ski.lol/attackbases.exe
[15:13:23] <sowemeetagain> Nah I have a VPS but no domains :(
[15:13:31] <sowemeetagain> Gimme a few to FTP and config
[15:13:59] <oxfouzer> sowemeetagain: http://dot.tk
[15:14:03] <oxfouzer> Free domain :)
[15:14:42] <sowemeetagain> Solid find! Many thanks!
[15:14:52] <sowemeetagain> Have you used these guys before?
[15:18:03] <sowemeetagain> @oxfouzer 216.120.236.202:12345/
[15:18:14] <oxfouzer> absolutely I have used dot.tk before
[15:18:24] <sowemeetagain> that home page
[15:18:27] <sowemeetagain> is the one in question
[15:18:34] <sowemeetagain> the footer works on the rest of the pages
[15:18:38] <oxfouzer> I did stuff like devsite.tk or something when I didnt have a domain
[15:18:49] <Desode> dot.tk is as old as the internet
[15:18:56] <Desode> Surprising people still don't know of its existence
[15:18:58] <sowemeetagain> That's exactly what I am doing currently
[15:19:14] <oxfouzer> Desode: exactly :P keep it a secret
[15:19:22] <oxfouzer> actually, I am running a production site!
[15:19:26] <oxfouzer> http://impoll.tk
[15:19:28] <oxfouzer> lol
[15:19:49] <sowemeetagain> haha
[15:19:51] <sowemeetagain> i dig it
[15:19:59] <Desode> Best example of a .tk site is for the TclTk programming language in my opinion:  www.tcl.tk   hehe
[15:20:01] <sayd> does modernizr clobber $?
[15:21:04] <sowemeetagain> I've never even heard of tk until today but I'm checking tcl.tk
[15:21:29] <sowemeetagain> oxfouzer did you get the IP, I got a live example for ya
[15:22:28] <oxfouzer> sowemeetagain: im looking at your page...
[15:22:53] <oxfouzer> i see the footer just fine, so idk what you are atlking about lol
[15:22:57] <oxfouzer> but I have to go...
[15:23:39] <sowemeetagain> on the main page? awww
[15:23:40] <sowemeetagain> okay
[15:23:52] <oxfouzer> well just so you know
[15:23:57] <oxfouzer> the 'footer' element is your header
[15:24:00] <oxfouzer> maybe thats why you are confused
[15:24:04] <oxfouzer> get firefox and firebug
[15:24:30] <sowemeetagain> ok
[15:24:31] <sowemeetagain> thanks man
[15:24:47] <oxfouzer> have you ever used firebug?
[15:24:50] <sowemeetagain> yeah
[15:24:51] <oxfouzer> if not, you will love it
[15:24:51] <sowemeetagain> I have it
[15:24:52] <oxfouzer> ah
[15:24:59] <sowemeetagain> Im still a little confused though
[15:25:01] <oxfouzer> but it looks like 'footer' has all your header elements in it
[15:25:06] <oxfouzer> which might lead to your confusion
[15:25:15] <sowemeetagain> I'm checking my code now
[15:25:57] <biberao_> hi
[15:26:09] <sowemeetagain> I don't see what you're talking about honestly, my footer is programmed as it should be? I'm checking in firebug
[15:26:47] <TelFiRE> Ok, for the record it makes everything much much easier to have both the mouse over element and the mouse out element be inside a parent, and the parent is what you actually call hoverIntent on...
[15:37:16] <eedfwChris> Hey guys... Any idea why this speeds up as it scrolls down http://myinstachristmas.com/media/instagrid
[15:43:05] <shoky> eedfwChris: what do you mean?
[15:43:19] <eedfwChris> shoky: eh nevermind i am going to go another route
[15:43:21] <eedfwChris> thanks
[15:52:39] <nickhs> Howdy! I have the following function http://jsfiddle.net/LNZmH/ which is meant to do an ajax call to /success?id=foobar however it doesn't seem to be appending the query string? Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[15:56:33] <Whirl3d> right off hand does anyone know how to change the placeholder color or opacity?
[15:56:54] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: in webkit there is a webkit only pseudo selector for it
[15:56:59] <johnkpaul> there's no way to do it generically afaik
[15:57:10] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/style-placeholder-text/
[15:57:17] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks.
[15:57:22] <johnkpaul> np
[15:57:44] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I've stopped using the placeholder property beacuse of this
[15:58:01] <johnkpaul> in order to match the required design, it's not really possible
[16:00:22] <Whirl3d> I see. Do you use a plugin instead?
[16:00:34] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: yeah
[16:01:12] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: I've modified https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder to do the same thing whether or not placeholder is supported
[16:01:19] <johnkpaul> and clear out the placeholder attribute
[16:02:36] <eddiemonge> nickhs: yeah, you need to actually append the url
[16:02:58] <eddiemonge> nickhs: or else check for the param in your post/get data
[16:04:24] <nickhs> eddiemonge: I don't follow? I was under the impression by passing a map into data it would format it into a querystring and append it? No?
[16:04:36] <eddiemonge> nickhs: no
[16:04:45] <eddiemonge> did you read the docs for ajax?
[16:05:04] <eddiemonge> itll somewhat do that for get requests but not post
[16:05:11] <nickhs> eddiemonge: "Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests."  from http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:05:18] <nickhs> eddiemonge: and this is a GET request
[16:05:35] <Whirl3d> perhaps there's a better way to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yfkxu/54/
[16:05:55] <Whirl3d> I wanted to make it so that the input fields don't clutter the form unless needed
[16:06:14] <Whirl3d> No Reply crashes Chrome...looking into that
[16:06:52] <eddiemonge> nickhs
[16:06:56] <eddiemonge> nickhs http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/LNZmH/1/
[16:07:24] <nickhs> eddiemonge: ?
[16:08:06] <nickhs> eddiemonge: my bad, found it. this.id is undefined
[16:12:03] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: why not something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/yfkxu/55/
[16:15:06] <robert_> can I do something like $(this, "") when I'm traversing an html fragment that I've constructed myself?
[16:15:53] <eddiemonge> robert_: what is that supposed to  find?
[16:16:21] <robert_> whatever "" is inside the mini-dom I've constructed from my web application
[16:16:34] <sowemeetagain> @oxfridaynight I got it
[16:16:35] <b-ot> sowemeetagain, definitely being used as one ;)
[16:16:48] <sowemeetagain> what
[16:17:21] <robert_> the bot was trolling you, lol
[16:17:36] <sowemeetagain> How to I message someone publicly so it lets them know I'm talking to em? I got yelled at when I private messaged last time
[16:18:34] <eddiemonge> robert_: whateveryourdomis.find("whatev")
[16:18:45] <eddiemonge> robert_: assuming your dom fragment is a jquery object
[16:21:20] <s34n_> Using jquery mobile, I'm trying to get an input control and a button to share a line. I set them both to data-inline, but it didn't do the trick.
[16:28:21] <sowemeetagain> <reply>
[16:42:55] <db42> hi, is there no #jquerymobile ?
[16:45:05] <db42> I am trying to do a jquery mobile page which has both an form, and an list, but on my mobilesafari they seem to step on each other (and on my regular safari, they dont), ideas ?
[16:45:41] <sowemeetagain> What do you mean step on eachother? Can you throw it in a jsfiddle?
[16:45:47] <Whirl3d> step on each other?
[16:49:19] <db42> hmmm, let me check out if i can easily put it in jsfiddle
[16:49:25] <db42> Whirl3d, the form goes under the form
[16:49:30] <db42> blah, under the list....
[16:49:42] <robert_> eddiemonge: I made my html fragment a jquery object, and now I'm trying to select "html > body > div#response" using miniDom.child("html > body > #response"), but it ain't working. it just keeps comin' up blank. :/
[16:51:54] <db42> http://jsfiddle.net/8rChR/ <-- this is the jsfiddle of the issue
[16:52:58] <db42> (looks fine on safari, not on mobilesafari)
[16:57:25] <robert_> eddiemonge: ping?
[16:57:37] <db42> sowemeetagain, seen it?
[16:58:00] <eddiemonge> robert_: what are you creating? code is helpful
[16:58:21] <sowemeetagain> looks fine to me whats the issue
[16:59:11] <robert_> eddiemonge: okay. Gimme a moment to recreate this
[16:59:30] <BryanRuiz> is it possible to attach an event to when an object is hiden or unhidden?
[16:59:45] <db42> sowemeetagain, on MobileSafari ??
[16:59:48] <BryanRuiz> to an*
[17:01:00] <eddiemonge> BryanRuiz: whats hiding/showing it? call your action then
[17:02:06] <BryanRuiz> eddiemonge: im considering that, but i have to figure out where that is
[17:02:13] <sowemeetagain> Checking on the ipad for you hang tight
[17:02:37] <db42> k, altough i'm testing on an iphone
[17:02:44] <sowemeetagain> yeah looks the same as the fiddle on the pc
[17:02:47] <db42> argh
[17:03:03] <db42> welp on an iphone 4s (ios 5.0.1) the form is abit hidden under the list
[17:03:10] <sowemeetagain> I don't have an iPhone, i'm afraid :/
[17:03:27] <db42> welp, seems like a br between the list and form fixes it on the iphone
[17:03:58] <sowemeetagain> yeah just roll with that if it works and doesn't throw off your design
[17:04:57] <db42> rofl, w8
[17:05:15] <db42> there is the bug everywhere, even on that fiddle on my safari… you don't see the form's text label, it's hidden under the list
[17:05:26] <db42> you need do add an <br> before the form in order to see the label
[17:05:43] <db42> (safari on comp)
[17:06:09] <db42> ohh, he left.. anyone else care to take a look @ the fiddle ?
[17:08:17] <robert_> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/qcynp/
[17:08:29] <robert_> yeah it's not much, but it's enough to show the issues I'm having
[17:10:37] <kenalex> hello
[17:12:07] <kenalex> is there a way of using javascript (jquery) to asynchonously upload a file to a server and show the progress of the  file being uploaded using a progress bar ?
[17:15:25] <eddiemonge> robert_: thats not a html fragment. thats a full page
[17:15:30] <eddiemonge> why are you creating a full page?
[17:15:41] <eddiemonge> kenalex: not without flash
[17:16:26] <eddiemonge> db42: ?
[17:17:16] <db42> http://jsfiddle.net/8rChR/ <-- this is the jsfiddle of the issue, the form is abit under the list (the label isn't show for example), why is that ?
[17:20:33] <eddiemonge> no idea
[17:22:17] <popof_> did jquery remove dotimeout?
[17:22:38] <eddiemonge> dotimeout?
[17:22:58] <popof_> eddiemonge: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-dotimeout/docs/files/jquery-ba-dotimeout-js.html
[17:23:06] <popof_> eddiemonge: jQuery.doTimeout( [ id, ] delay, callback [, arg ... ] );
[17:23:23] <eddiemonge> thats not jquery. thats a jquery plugin writen by ben_alman
[17:23:43] <popof_> eddiemonge: ah.
[17:23:51] <popof_> eddiemonge: Thank you kindly.
[18:04:29] <Whirl3d> did you try this question on the googles first?
[18:22:46] <Whirl3d> so does that mean that I am missing out on the real conversation?
[18:33:58] <db42> Whirl3d, on a  netsplit?
[18:35:51] <Whirl3d> lol. I wasn't serious I talk to myself all the time, really. Good to know abou tthe netsplit thing.
[18:55:42] <relipse> can someone please go to https://cworklog.com and login using test116 test116 and tell me how do make the arrow drop down menu smaller
[18:55:50] <relipse> its a jqueryui menu
[18:58:54] <lux42> the menu or the button... the menu itself is pretty small
[19:22:34] <hugo_moss> anybody else have a problem with adding overflow-x: hidden causing a flicker in safari ipad?
[20:11:45] <scar> Whirl3d, yes i did, but i found not many answers for a "full" integration. i thought about doing it in parts.. maybe at intervals within my ajax function can set the progress bar to X percentage, however i cannot figure out how to keep a full ajax call without breaking it into multiple
[20:31:01] <Whirl3d> scar, my first google result was this: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Progressbar  Not that I doubt you that it's not the right solution, but how do you mean?
[20:38:31] <scar> Whirl3d, i want to use an .ajax() request to a PHP script, and have the progressbar show the duration of the ajax request. ive seen methods such as setting a session var for the seconds, et
[20:38:51] <scar> ive thought about breaking the ajax call into parts, and as each part is done, update the progress...
[20:38:57] <scar> but i dont think it's practical.
[20:59:11] <popof_> Hi, is there a way to reference the only p element of an id'd element? i.e. <div id="blah><p>text</p></div> you would use $('#blah').p or so
[21:04:46] <tw2113> $('#blah').html()
[21:05:07] <biyectivo> Hi, i'm using a jquery plugin called AnythingSlider. I have 3 sliders in my page and one of them is not displaying correctly in IE8-. I'm getting SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.
[21:05:07] <biyectivo> jquery.min.js, line 2 character 66658 in the Developer Tools console. Any ideas?
[21:05:10] <tw2113> unless you don't want the "text" part as well
[21:19:04] <scar> popof_, you could also do $('#blah p')
[21:19:17] <popof_> scar: ah awesome
[21:19:19] <popof_> scar: thanks!
[21:19:27] <popof_> tw2113: andthank you too

[22:00:24] <codeshah> view-source:http://foodspun.com/feed/
[22:04:12] <tw2113> i don't think jquery.get is the right thing for that
[22:05:23] <codeshah> tw2113: no? why not? .. get a feed?
[22:05:30] <tw2113> ?get
[22:05:31] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:06:07] <codeshah> hmm
[22:06:19] <codeshah> what should I use? I used getJSON for flirkc api
[22:08:13] <tw2113>  not sure with xml

[22:14:01] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/

[22:14:14] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:18:48] <monk3y> So is there a similar function to jQuery's .post that just does a .get .. but it's not called .get?  Or am I a n00b?  Or lacking sleep?  Or both?
[22:20:17] <subbyyy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ ?

[22:20:27] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

[23:30:22] <coj> hey all, does anyone use paul's irish's infinite scroll script? if the target element is being replaced by ajax and the url for the next page changes, how would one reload/update the infinite scroll object accordingly? otherwise it doesn't seem to work right
[23:32:25] <popof_> coj: only trust the scots

[23:50:46] <anew> i'm getting a 404 with my ajax call, but when i visit the link it's there?
[23:53:10] <monk3y> How do you know the ajax call is giving you a 404?  In the error-handler?  Or the data back?
[23:53:24] <aqeel> hi room
[23:54:24] <aqeel> 404 is when page does not exist, if data is there but wrong page or msispelled name thus load page error
[23:55:17] <anew> monk3y in console
[23:55:18] <monk3y> Heh I know what a 404 should be .. but just wondering how you're seeing that it's a 404 from the ajax call.
[23:55:23] <anew> i get POST 404
[23:55:28] <monk3y> Ok .. the XHR object?
[23:55:33] <monk3y> Or something like that?
[23:55:45] <anew> well it's weird xhr goes thru, but right above it and in network the post request is 404
[23:55:47] <aqeel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5482687/my-ajax-throwing-404-error
[23:56:04] <monk3y> Is that your question, or is that someone with a similar situation?
[23:56:15] <anew> huh?
[23:56:21] <anew> no that's not me
[23:56:24] <monk3y> haha
[23:56:40] <monk3y> I just key both of you off your first character 'a', and therefore; you're the same person.
