[10:48:45] <WebmasterNotDev> Hi, am trying to add a function to video site. On video page switching between mirror one and mirror 2 both being embed iframe codes. Ive been readingup but the more I do the more Im overwhelmed
[18:23:02] <scoopgracie> i personally believe that modern web standards have made jquery useless, but it is still in widespread use. what does it do better?
[18:28:54] <dw1> everything
[18:32:57] <dw1> just easier to code than vanilla
[18:32:59] <dw1> mostly
[18:33:38] <dw1> lots of useful helper functions
[18:34:35] <dw1> set up logically and consistently, able to be chained, etc
[18:35:06] <scoopgracie> dw1: don't promises make stuff chainable now?
[18:35:22] <dw1> some
