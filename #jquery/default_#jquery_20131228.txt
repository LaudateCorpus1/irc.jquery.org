[03:27:22] <Didji> Is an onresize event trigger when a div changes size?
[03:29:12] <Didji> Or to have to constantly poll them for size differences?
[03:34:37] <Fs0i> Hey guys, I have the following problem: I'm currently writing sort of an rss-reader. I get the description-tag as a json-object. Now I want to put in onto my page, and I got 2 major problems: first, I dont want any foreign scripts on my site, and no style-sheets et cetera, so I want all tags removed except p,b,blockquote,.... Links should be unedited, except when they have javascript as href. All events should be unbinded.
[03:35:00] <Fs0i> The second problem I have is that the newsfeed of the german newspaper taz uses relative urls for images.
[03:35:14] <Fs0i> http://www.taz.de/rss.xml
[03:35:54] <Fs0i> I need to rewrite those, but how? Something like an base-element just working within a <div> would be nice...
[05:55:00] <nicholasschulz> i feel worthless right now,.. trying to ask a question, and in doing so I'm preparing a jsfiddle that i can't get the css to work with… anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/
[05:58:38] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz
[05:58:43] <BinaryKitten> class=".div_imgContainer"
[05:58:56] <BinaryKitten> remove the .
[05:59:06] <nicholasschulz> omg hahah
[05:59:07] <nicholasschulz> thanks
[05:59:17] <nicholasschulz> *embarrased*
[06:00:20] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz wood for trees
[06:00:32] <nicholasschulz> hmmm.. my question was going to be: "why doesnt this work?", however it does work so now I'm really confused.
[06:06:35] <nicholasschulz> how can i make it fade back in when the mouse leaves the class? http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/1/
[06:06:54] <BinaryKitten> add a second function
[06:07:32] <nicholasschulz> i thought i did when i added .mouseleave() {}
[06:10:19] <aro> does anyone know of a good way to build google sitemaps
[06:12:01] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/2/ @ nicholasschulz
[06:13:17] <nicholasschulz> BinaryKitten: it still behaves in the same manner
[06:14:48] <aro> nicholasschulz what are you trying to do
[06:15:12] <nicholasschulz> fade out, and stay faded until mouse moves off the class
[06:15:40] <nicholasschulz> now it fades out, and fade back in BEFORE mouse leaves the class
[06:16:12] <aro> ok so add a listener inside the fade in event
[06:16:39] <aro> what do you want it to do?
[06:16:45] <aro> fade out on mouse over?
[06:16:49] <BinaryKitten> aro ?
[06:16:54] <aro> ?
[06:17:08] <BinaryKitten> they want it to fade out, and when the mouse leaves fade in again
[06:17:16] <aro> ok
[06:17:21] <BinaryKitten> the issue is that the fade out triggeres the mouseleave event
[06:17:29] <BinaryKitten> since the element is no longer on screen
[06:17:38] <BinaryKitten> thus it triggers the fade in again
[06:17:40] <aro> so use animate opacity
[06:18:04] <aro> $.animate({opacity: 0}, callback());
[06:18:25] <aro> then in your callback - put the mouseleave listener
[06:18:54] <aro> if u want i can do it
[06:18:56] <BinaryKitten> that will only work the once then will cause issues
[06:19:03] <BinaryKitten> with multiple binding
[06:19:13] <aro> hmm
[06:23:17] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/4/
[06:23:51] * aro wins
[06:24:20] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/5/ uses your opacity of 0.3
[06:24:27] * aro bows
[06:24:47] <aro> nicholasschulz: are you still there
[06:25:06] <nicholasschulz> yup. admiring your work ;-)
[06:25:10] <nicholasschulz> thanks
[06:25:10] <aro> hehe
[06:25:12] <aro> np
[06:25:53] <aro> if you want to prevent it from going crazy if someone mouse ons and offs a ton of times
[06:25:54] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/6/
[06:25:59] <aro> add a .stop there
[06:26:19] <BinaryKitten> aro ewww
[06:26:34] <aro> ?
[06:26:42] <aro> what
[06:26:44] <BinaryKitten> #5 rebinds mouseout every time
[06:26:54] <aro> so unbind it
[06:27:01] <BinaryKitten> that's so messy
[06:27:05] <BinaryKitten> and memory intensive
[06:27:06] <aro> not really
[06:27:11] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/6/ works just as well
[06:27:24] <BinaryKitten> without the whole binding issue
[06:27:40] <nicholasschulz> can i add a "timer" in front? mouseover for say 0.5 sec in order for it to not 'go crazy' as you putt t?
[06:27:51] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/7/
[06:27:53] <aro> there
[06:27:59] <aro> nicholasschulz: use hoverintent
[06:28:11] <BinaryKitten> that's actually worse aro
[06:28:17] <aro> hoverintent?
[06:28:21] <aro> whats so bad about that
[06:28:21] <BinaryKitten> you're removing ALL events
[06:28:47] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz i agree to use hoverintent
[06:29:06] <BinaryKitten> that's a good plugin to use to get that
[06:30:23] <nicholasschulz> okey dokey. thanks
[06:33:40] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz this is with hoverIntent http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/8/
[06:33:59] <BinaryKitten> it also stores the value for the opacity for you and reverts to that
[06:34:20] <BinaryKitten> so you can change the opacity in the css and won't have to update the js
[06:34:47] <nicholasschulz> sweet! gracias amigo
[06:35:01] <nicholasschulz> do i need to download the hoverintent.js file? or is it standard?
[06:35:18] <BinaryKitten> you need to get it from http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[06:36:56] <nicholasschulz> k, thanks
[06:39:43] <nicholasschulz> thanks to you: http://bannaky.com/merken/ :-) don't know what i am making, but i need something to do during christmas…. hehe
[06:43:09] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz :)
[06:43:13] <BinaryKitten> we can make it better!
[06:43:38] <nicholasschulz> haha ok, i appreciate all suggestions!
[06:43:46] <BinaryKitten> remove the divs
[06:44:04] <BinaryKitten> set the img css to opacity to 0.3
[06:44:33] <nicholasschulz> yeah, i know.. but my next 'plan' is to randomly change around the images.. hence, i need the divs :-S (?)
[06:44:44] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[06:44:49] <BinaryKitten> randomly change around?
[06:45:07] <nicholasschulz> well, replace.. so that the background is changing
[06:47:04] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/9/
[06:48:00] <nicholasschulz> but before i start working on that i want to automatically adjust the width of all the pictures so that it fills the screen no matter resolution or browser-width…
[06:48:19] <BinaryKitten> 3 a row?
[06:48:50] <nicholasschulz> 5
[06:49:25] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/10/
[06:49:30] <BinaryKitten> width: 20% on the div
[06:49:34] <nicholasschulz> looks good on my 1280*800 with 5 @ 256px each
[06:49:34] <BinaryKitten> and 100% on the img
[06:49:58] <nicholasschulz> wow, that was easy :-)
[06:50:00] <nicholasschulz> thanks!
[06:50:04] <BinaryKitten> css Ftw!
[06:51:25] <nicholasschulz> sweet :-)
[06:56:25] <BinaryKitten> nicholasschulz http://jsfiddle.net/jL5y4/11/ <--- now with captions
[06:56:26] <BinaryKitten> :D
[06:56:55] <nicholasschulz> love it! i actually needed that :-)
[06:58:28] <BinaryKitten> ok i'll leave you with that then nicholasschulz
[06:58:33] <BinaryKitten> have fun!

[08:22:00] <wayne> hi. when you pass .text() an anonymous function with a single parameter, what does text() pass as the parameter?
[08:22:30] <T13|needsCoffee> !text
[08:23:15] <T13|needsCoffee> !help
[08:23:15] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: NO U!

[08:33:10] <felixjet> how i can make this selector works? form[type="search"]
[08:33:56] <joroci> input?
[08:34:09] <felixjet> form is not an input
[08:34:22] <cpt_cupcake> $('form[type="search"]') ?
[08:34:28] <grafi> oô
[08:34:28] <joroci> but you are looking for the inputs?
[08:34:31] <cpt_cupcake> type=search*
[08:34:37] <felixjet> oh nvm
[08:34:54] <felixjet> im using type=search on the input u are right
[08:35:02] <felixjet> i believed it was on the <form> tag
[08:35:02] <felixjet> :p
[08:35:13] <cpt_cupcake> ^.^
[08:35:18] <joroci> :)
[08:37:43] <micz123> hi all
[08:38:20] <cpt_cupcake> Hey micz123
[08:38:57] <micz123> can someone tell me how to do setTimeOut the right way? I'm still learning and this is what i set up, but its not working http://paste.laravel.com/1i69
[08:39:18] <micz123> hi cpt_cupcake
[08:41:04] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 you are running a self invoking function and you are trying to call the function within it
[08:41:34] <micz123> cpt_cupcake yes i want it to run by itself
[08:44:39] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Jkcrt
[08:45:09] <Velveeta> you're also spelling setTimeout with the wrong case
[08:45:11] <cpt_cupcake> Firstly I recommend running $(document).ready or $(window).load. In addition setTimeOut references a function
[08:46:15] <micz123> cpt_cupcake i alrdy click on ur link but no result in the lower space?
[08:46:24] <micz123> velveeta dooh! T_T
[08:46:34] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 lower space?
[08:46:57] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 you mean the x = x+2?
[08:47:17] <micz123> cpt_cupcake the lower white space where it supposed to show the result?
[08:47:36] <cpt_cupcake> It is displaying the message on the right side
[08:47:43] <micz123> anyway when i change setTimeOut to setTimeout, it runs like crazy T_T noobs mistakes
[08:48:48] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 you can add a <br> before the "Whoooa", then it will be displayed below the initial div
[08:48:50] <micz123> cpt_cupcake i found stackoverflow post with solution just like urs, i"ll take a read on that now to get better understanding
[08:49:06] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 kk :P
[08:49:44] <micz123> thx... im new at this so i still dont really grasp it
[08:50:35] <cpt_cupcake> micz123 No problem at all mate. Scopes hit me completely at the beginning ^.^
[08:57:12] <Siecje> I'm using the jquery validate plugin but how do I control where the error messages are located
[09:30:54] <nicholasschulz> how can i slide a div at a constant speed up- or downwards? some sort of offset? i want to slide the div containing all the pictures in the background upwards at a slow constant speed… http://bannaky.com/merken/
[09:56:58] <nicholasschulz> anyone who knows what "Remember the good moments" are in german? i don't trust google translate
[10:17:44] <DjMadness> is there any way i can add some sort of click event to the background image of an input type=text, but not the rest of the input ? I have an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/chd8W/1/
[10:26:30] <rmill> DjMadness: Not really, no.
[10:26:45] <rmill> click events can only be applied to DOM elements
[10:29:13] <DjMadness> rmill: there is some sort of .position() element, but that only works with top and left, there seams to be no right element for it
[10:30:42] <DjMadness> someone made an example here http://jsfiddle.net/AMsK9/313/ but the lack of the right property kinda loses the point
[11:01:32] <DjMadness> i managed to create a hack to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/chd8W/3/
[11:23:44] <LrdArc> hi, can someone answer this question?? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16714934/dynamically-updated-datalist-wont-show?rq=1 --it's not mine but i have same problem with him.
[14:42:34] <nicholasschulz> anyone know how to 'crop' a image without actually cropping it… ? :-P lets say i have a pic (500x400), but i want to show only the centered canvas of 400x400,… idk if u understand what i mean
[14:44:34] <tw2113> nicholasschulz, you could add "overflow:hidden" to a div and apply the image as a background
[14:44:42] <tw2113> then use background-position to move it around
[14:44:52] <tw2113> make the div the size of the viewport you want
[14:45:02] <nicholasschulz> that is a really good idea!
[14:45:08] <nicholasschulz> thanks tw2113
[15:16:43] <zulcc> whats going on, why am i plastered with syntax errors all over the place? http://dpaste.com/1527470/
[15:17:42] <tw2113> what syntax errors?
[15:19:07] <zulcc> netbeans is pretending that this is not in proper quotation marks, throwing for example "unterminated string literal" or "missing ; before statement" and so on
[15:19:29] <zulcc> one syntax error in every line... i don't get it
[15:19:32] <tw2113> dunno
[15:19:35] <tw2113> looks legit to me
[15:19:39] <tw2113> but i don't use netbeans
[15:20:13] <tw2113> unless it's taking all the white space literally
[15:26:10] <zulcc> i can't even place that HTML in a separate variable. time to change IDE i guess. there must be some weird character in that HTML that drives netbeans nuts
[15:31:38] <zulcc> the linebreaks are the problem. it really wants the whole prepend code in one spaghetti and automatically inserts \n\ when i hit enter inside prepend
[15:33:29] <zulcc> i asume that's not really necessary from a javascript syntax standpoint
[15:34:17] <snover> zulcc: you can’t have literal line break characters inside strings in javascript
[15:34:23] <snover> netbeans is right, your code is wrong
[15:35:12] <zulcc> whoa. true, really throws the errors upon rendering. whats a convenient solution for this, to paste a big chunk of html in javascript?
[15:35:32] <tw2113> or avoid constructing so much html with javascript
[15:35:49] <gordian> any idea why setting this as my action in an AJAX request results in nothing being returned? http://pastebin.com/bF4CJPxW
[15:37:04] <gordian> i have dataType: 'json' in the ajax call
[15:37:49] <zulcc> it's the only spot where i do. i should place that HTML in a separate file and load() that into the div upon button click. im amazed that i never ran into this issue before
[15:38:13] <Uhkis> gordian: $_POST is always empty?
[15:38:31] <gordian> Uhkis: that would be a reason
[15:38:36] <gordian> i should revise my question
[15:38:48] <gordian> i see the JSON come through in my header, but not in my console
[15:39:02] <gordian> i have console.log(data) in my success function
[15:39:32] <gordian> so $_POST is not empty here
[15:39:54] <gordian> because the JSON makes it to the response header
[15:40:14] <Uhkis> then you might wanna show the js side too..
[15:40:23] <gordian> k...
[15:41:14] <gordian> Uhkis: http://pastebin.com/e2jEREKn
[15:43:30] <tw2113> try success: function(data) {
[15:43:55] <gordian> actually i had removed it for testing
[15:43:56] <tw2113> making you actually pass in the data to your function
[15:44:01] <gordian> just put it back and same result
[15:44:08] <Uhkis> yes, your success function is missing the return data parameter
[15:44:25] <gordian> weird
[15:44:48] <gordian> in the php if i insert die(); into line 35 then the error JSON comes through
[15:45:57] <Uhkis> maybe there's something else printed after and it's not json anymore
[15:47:31] <gordian> woah
[15:48:07] <gordian> ok if i remove the dataType: 'json' then the error echoes just fine, but the success outputs a ton of html markup
[15:48:23] <gordian> but the success json isn't there at all, not even as text
[15:49:23] <Uhkis> better kill that script then :-)
[15:50:22] <gordian> but there's nothing after it
[15:50:26] <gordian> there was, but i removed it
[15:50:48] <Uhkis> this is part of wordpress?
[15:50:52] <gordian> yes
[15:51:11] <tw2113> he's been ajaxifying the login process since yesterday evening
[15:51:25] <Uhkis> wp's bootstrap runs during that call then?
[15:52:22] <gordian> wp's bootstarap?
[15:52:27] <gordian> bootstrap?
[15:52:45] <nicholasschulz_> #php
[15:53:23] <Uhkis> i'm pretty sure there's #wordpress or something
[15:54:24] <tw2113> i'd argue it could be asked both in here and #wordpress
[15:54:32] <tw2113> since it is an ajax question as well
[15:54:42] <tw2113> but the triggering login part would go elsewhere
[15:55:27] <Uhkis> in this case, wp's system is clearly the one doing the shenanigans
[15:55:57] <gordian> yeah it is
[15:56:05] <gordian> well, now i know that
[15:56:06] <gordian> didn't before
[15:56:12] <gordian> thanks Uhkis
[15:56:15] <gordian> and tw2113
[15:56:16] <Uhkis> np!
[15:56:21] <gordian> see you in #wordpress ;-)
[15:56:28] <Uhkis> go #drupal! ;D
[16:09:01] <CobaltHex> if i set my max height as a percentage
[16:09:07] <CobaltHex> is it possible to get what that would be in pixels?
[16:09:13] <CobaltHex> or convert '90%' to .9
[16:09:14] <CobaltHex> in js
[16:12:32] <nicholasschulz> how would you go about loading more pictures (if there are more pictures to load) when reaching the bottom of the browser window? like Facebook loads more news in the newsfeed as you scroll down..
[16:14:22] <CobaltHex> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/lazy-loading-images/
[16:14:30] <CobaltHex> lazy loading
[16:14:33] <CobaltHex> google for a jquery example
[16:14:44] <CobaltHex> http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[16:25:43] <gordian> actually that sounds more like infinite scrolling CobaltHex
[16:25:52] <gordian> but op is gone :-/
[16:29:40] <CobaltHex> well infinite scrolling uses lazy loading
[17:49:54] <Whirl3d> Hey friends. Does anyone know of an interactive map application that uses a database to display data dynamically for each state upon rollover?
[17:50:18] <Whirl3d> Simply rollover a state and a window with stats appears. Seems like someone has to have done this already.
[18:18:27] <Whirl3d> Hello out there? Anybody home?
[18:18:33] <miCSu> yup
[18:18:38] <Velveeta> whirl3d: i would imagine someone has also, but any such implementation is gonna be specific to their own needs for it.. are you talking about some kind of 3rd party api you can just connect to and use? what kind of data are you wanting pulled from the db and displayed on rollover?
[18:19:42] <Whirl3d> Velveeta, miCSu, thanks for the reply. I was looking for a jquery plugin that allowed me to generate the interactive map with ANY data object that appears on rollover
[18:20:21] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure there's no jquery plugin that deals with interactive maps with arbitrary data rollover
[18:20:32] <Whirl3d> If the plugin doesn't already exist, may I will write it
[18:20:44] <miCSu> Whirl3d: have you checked if google maps api has some possibility to implement this?
[18:20:45] <Velveeta> you should be able to do it with the google maps api, if you have state border coordinates and whatnot to feed to it
[18:21:40] <Whirl3d> How does the mouseover javascript work with respect to complicated shapes. I am afraid I will have to use Canvas to accurately tract the various shapes.
[18:21:50] <miCSu> there's some info about using custom php and mysql db with gmaps api https://developers.google.com/maps/articles/phpsqlajax_v3?hl=en
[18:21:53] <Whirl3d> I never considered the Google Maps API. That's a great idea
[18:22:34] <Velveeta> at my company, we have a product with some google map integration with mouseover data popups… it's not at the state level, but for clustered areas in general
[18:22:44] <Velveeta> so it's definitely possible
[18:23:27] <miCSu> must say that google's apis are pretty awesome
[18:24:20] <Whirl3d> That's a great idea. I am sure that I can add layers of granularity to my project and the API will allow it to get more and more detailed and precise as the project needs.
[18:24:28] <Whirl3d> Thanks for the suggestion.
[18:26:30] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, if you recall our discussion several nights ago, I popped by to let you know I got the timeline changing javascript only. It doesn't update the "key" to the right but it works better and requires no post-backs.
[18:26:51] <Whirl3d> http://codecanyon.net/item/responsive-usa-map-html5/full_screen_preview/4527698   wild.
[18:26:55] <Cryp17c> Once I get the key so that its updated properly, I'll update the site and whatnot.
[18:33:33] <Velveeta> cryp17c: sounds good, so is there anything i can help with on that or are you just letting me know how it's going? :)
[18:43:07] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, just pestering you with the update. I'm sure once I've got the timeline_change stuff done, I'd like for someone to just peek at it with a mind for efficiency, but that probably won't be for a bit.
[18:43:40] <Velveeta> not a problem, i'm just sitting here reading a few articles, having a beer, and watching a movie :)
[18:47:07] <Velveeta> cryp17c: i just loaded the page, and it took about a minute to come up with anything due to that initialize transfer that i'm assuming is transmitting all of the data, so there's definitely some room for optimizing, i have one idea already cooking :)
[18:47:33] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, I didn't think the production site had any of the code for the "load all timeline data"
[18:47:50] <Velveeta> i didn't know if it would or not, but figured i'd check
[18:48:02] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, try to refresh, see if it takes as long now.
[18:48:24] <Cryp17c> You were probably the first visitor in a few days, maybe the wsgi process had spun down or something.
[18:48:44] <Cryp17c> It loaded up fairly quickly for me; there isn't any timeline_data code on the site atm so no reason it should be any slower.
[18:49:29] <Velveeta> yeah it's still in the process of transferring a big data bundle down to me right now
[18:49:44] <Velveeta> just passed the 1 meg mark
[18:49:52] <Velveeta> and hit 1.2mb and finally rendered
[18:50:41] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, 1.2 mb? that's crazy...
[18:51:12] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, ohwait. Yeah that's the size of just the initial display..
[18:51:50] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, lol, the fetch_timeline_data is fast enough on my system but I just looked at the transfer size: 11mb.
[18:52:07] <Velveeta> yowza! :D
[18:52:37] <Cryp17c> That's to build the json object which contains the 2d array data_timeline[timeline_year][planet_id]
[18:52:48] <Cryp17c> for all timelines.
[18:52:59] <Velveeta> yeah i figured it had something to do with the data
[18:53:27] <Cryp17c> Well, the 1.2 mb is just for the default year :(
[18:53:35] <Cryp17c> May have to do something different to improve responsiveness.
[18:53:58] <Cryp17c> Think I should split each load_timeline_data into a separate request?
[18:55:46] <Velveeta> i probably would, yeah, and with that kind of data payload, you may want to reconsider sending it all up front, that's a lot of data to push with only the possibility that the user is gonna want to view those other timelines
[19:02:18] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, thanks, as always.
[19:02:25] <Velveeta> :)
[19:26:07] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, the html of one year worth of data was 1.2 mb, but the data for 39 years was only 11mb. I was thinking of having the server-side return the json data and using the client's JS to build the HTML onto the dom. Sound like it might perform reasonably?
[19:26:20] <Cryp17c> but the json data for 39 years***
[19:26:33] <Velveeta> i would definitely not push consumable html, but rather just json
[19:27:00] <Velveeta> you can use a client side templating framework like handlebars or something to do the rendering of the data into markup
[19:27:36] <tw2113> in the words of Talking Heads, Stop making sense, cheese
[19:28:23] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, is client-side templating something you always do with repeatable data, or only in the cases where the generated HTML is undesirably large?
[19:29:27] <Velveeta> i would use it anytime you have repeatable data
[19:29:40] <Velveeta> plus, you can precompile your templates into javascript functions to save on runtime overhead
[19:30:08] <Velveeta> tw2113: i tried to stop making sense once… one divorce later, i've learned my lesson
[19:31:07] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, the only concern is that the templates have to be loaded in under script tags, which must be present when the initial page loads...this seems like - for an ajax implementation - a large number of template files being present (inside script tags) on the base page even though some (many/most) won't be used....?
[19:32:03] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, well, maybe the <script> tags don't need to be there, since they aren't actually processed as js.
[19:32:06] <Cryp17c> I'll give that a try.
[19:32:40] <Velveeta> yeah, you don't need to hold the template markup in script tags, though a lot of people do, but you could just hold them in hidden divs or whatever
[19:33:22] <Velveeta> but yeah, you would ideally not have a ton of different templates, you would ideally figure out a way to generically make 1, maybe 2 templates, to use for any given data you're throwing at it
[19:33:55] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how much your markup varies from data set to data set, but i would think you'd want to treat it all in an abstract manner, just swapping out the data and having the same markup and js deal with it
[19:35:25] <Cryp17c> Velveeta, for the star_map, yes. but for other repeatable lists, clearly a different layout.
[19:35:28] <Cryp17c> but I get what you mean.
[19:37:57] <Velveeta> oh yeah, i think i see what you're saying, then yeah, you'd want different templates for those things
[19:54:32] <gordian> Uhkis: you still here?
[20:11:34] <gordian> i setup an ajax request for this form: http://pastebin.com/bbBGu2Gw
[20:12:00] <gordian> when i parse the form data (in php) i start my function with if (!empty($_POST['login']))...
[20:12:49] <gordian> but when i assign 'login' a value in my ajax call then my form doesn't return any response headers on success
[20:12:57] <gordian> if i remove the if statement then everything is fine
[20:13:04] <gordian> im trying to understand why
[20:13:39] <Velveeta> that sounds like more of a php question
[20:15:56] <gordian> was hoping you wouldn't say that
[20:19:18] <zulcc> there is no javascript given at all in the pastebin to begin with
[20:21:34] <gordian> my question is about ajax and php
[21:00:45] <codepython777> is there another way to do hide() which does not just changes the display: value? For example hiding using off screen positioning?
[21:01:47] <sdct989> Hi there, is this the right place to let someone know that all of the widget links are broken on one of the legacy demo sites for jQuery mobile? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/
[21:04:44] <andromedian> codepython777,  .css();
[21:08:26] <codepython777> $(this).css("left", "150%"); ?
[21:14:09] <andromedian> codepython777, if your element has position:relative or absolute you have to expirement afterwards
[21:17:07] <codepython777> andromedian: positioning is giving me trouble
[21:35:26] <andromedian> codepython777, any live example?
