[00:45:24] <cyberbrai> how can i make the org chart with jquery drag and drop
[00:46:00] <cyberbrai> organization chart  for showing higher level to low level with d drag and drop
[00:46:14] <cyberbrai> any one who know about this
[00:52:41] <cyberbrai> reply
[00:56:14] <cyberbrai> approxi done my work on drag and drop functionality
[00:56:21] <cyberbrai> approx i done my work on drag and drop functionality
[01:04:08] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/mrksantos/60tpo6yh/7/ i seen lot of fiddle but not any of them related to jquery drag drop
[01:24:48] <DRSK> I'm using :focus and :hover to make a dropdown visible, ul.main-menu li:focus ul li { opacity: 1; } more or less. However, I'm unable to trigger "unfocus" using blur, triggering mouseleave/out or focusout. It simply won't let go of the dropdown if I hit links in it. I believe it's because the links are anchors/hashes. Anyone got any idea how to trigger off( 'focus' ) ?
[01:25:00] <DRSK> Oh, on iOS.
[01:26:39] <DRSK> I guess I'll have to add/removeClass..

[03:14:27] <sKylo> HI People ... i have a problem with setTimeout, it doesnt seem to work ... setTimeout("sb_off();",1000); -> sb_off() is a function.
[03:14:49] <Cork> sKylo: don't use a string for setTimeout
[03:14:58] <Cork> setTimeout(sb_off, 1000);
[03:15:03] <sKylo> ok i will try
[03:17:11] <sKylo> that has done the trick, everything works smooth now

[03:21:01] <Duikb00t> Hey,
[03:21:17] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to reset the append inputs after I have selected an other value in my dropdown? See: http://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/aLdbq9fc/
[03:29:41] <Tennis> perhaps you could approach it differently Duikb00t
[03:30:34] <Tennis> make them all exist and be hidden and then just play with whats on display
[03:32:05] <Duikb00t> Hmmm
[03:32:18] <Duikb00t> Isn't there just an easy way I can reset them after you select a new value? :)
[03:34:30] <gaurab> hi
[03:38:18] <Cork> Duikb00t: reset exists on the form
[03:38:26] <Cork> not individual input fields
[03:38:35] <Duikb00t> hmmm
[03:38:40] <Duikb00t> Pretty confused now
[03:39:53] <Duikb00t> So I have to reset on my form itselves?
[03:40:14] <Cork> Duikb00t: if you want to use the reset feature you do yes
[03:40:28] <Cork> Duikb00t: but you might not be looking for the reset feature
[03:40:35] <Cork> what exactly are you looking for?
[03:40:50] <Duikb00t> When you click on the value of the select box the field appear for the value you selected.
[03:40:58] <Duikb00t> But when you select 3 and then 2
[03:41:05] <Duikb00t> you get 5 fields instead of a reset of the first 3 fieds
[03:42:23] <Cork> ah, so you want to replace the elements instead of appending it sounds like
[03:43:53] <Duikb00t> Well if you now generate 4 fields the first time you get them.
[03:43:55] <Duikb00t> Perfect.
[03:44:16] <Duikb00t> But when you made a mistake and only want 3 fields...
[03:44:21] <Duikb00t> it add 3 fields EXTRA.
[03:44:32] <Duikb00t> But I should reset first and then generate those 3 fields you selected.
[03:45:07] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I have an element with script tags and br e.g. <div><script> some javascript </script> text <br/> some more text </div>  Im trying to get the text from this.  using .text() does this but I also need to retain the <br/>. Using html() breaks the page for some reason probably because of the inline javascript.  Any ideas anyone?
[03:45:18] <CocoStorm> How I could get the text and the <br/> line break too?
[03:45:23] <Duikb00t> Make a fiddle please
[03:45:27] <Duikb00t> jsfiddle.net
[03:45:46] <CocoStorm> me?
[03:46:08] <Duikb00t> yes
[03:46:26] <CocoStorm> It's quite a trivial question though, not sure if it needs demonstrating :`
[03:47:02] <Cork> CocoStorm: i would recommend moving the inline js
[03:47:22] <Cork> you want to separate the js from the html as much as possible to avoid problems like this
[03:47:23] <CocoStorm> Cork, I can't
[03:47:40] <Cork> then you might be out of luck
[03:47:52] <CocoStorm> Oh really?
[03:47:55] <Cork> .html() will serialize the dom elements back to html
[03:48:00] <Cork> so you will lose all element states
[03:48:15] <Cork> including all event handlers
[03:48:15] <CocoStorm> what element states?
[03:48:19] <CocoStorm> I see
[03:48:26] <Cork> like if it is input fields what was in them
[03:48:29] <Cork> event handlers
[03:48:41] <Duikb00t> http://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/a5zhpudb/ dammiiit :D
[03:48:43] <Cork> element references a script might keep
[03:49:09] <Duikb00t> There must be a way to resetthis
[03:49:31] <CocoStorm> The javascript is there to retrieve the current year
[03:49:44] <CocoStorm> hmm
[03:49:55] <Cork> Duikb00t: http://jsfiddle.net/a5zhpudb/1/
[03:49:59] <CocoStorm> Thanks Cork
[03:50:21] <Cork> except i fail...
[03:50:25] * Cork looks into why
[03:50:27] <Duikb00t> :D
[03:50:37] <Cork> ah i used the same variable name as you :x
[03:51:04] <Duikb00t> eheh?
[03:51:04] <Duikb00t> :D
[03:51:11] <Cork> Duikb00t: http://jsfiddle.net/a5zhpudb/2/
[03:51:23] <Cork> Duikb00t: you don't want to run append/prepend in a loop
[03:51:31] <Cork> that is very costly
[03:51:33] <Duikb00t> Why not? :)
[03:51:35] <fromers> hi does anyone know of a plugin that does the effect http://www.zoompanningeffectslider.com/index_zoom_opportune_fade.html wihtout it being in a slider... I'm mainly looking to do a hover effect on an image and when it is hovered the image to be zoom pan in slowly.
[03:51:49] <Cork> cause each time you run append/prepend you trigger a page reflow
[03:51:56] <Cork> and you do this over and over agian
[03:52:05] <Cork> and page reflow is the most expensive action the browser has
[03:52:16] <Cork> so you really want to avoid it as much as you can
[03:52:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: so instead build and array and concat it after the loop
[03:52:45] <Cork> that way you get one reflow
[03:52:51] <Cork> instead of x reflows
[03:52:55] <Duikb00t> Ok :D
[03:52:58] <Duikb00t> (y)
[03:53:04] <Duikb00t> Thanks for the explenation and the great help.
[03:53:07] <Cork> and it fixes your duplication problem too
[03:53:26] <Duikb00t> Should I use the 'n' var to make my name fields unique?
[03:53:39] <Duikb00t> name="gender[]"
[03:53:58] <Cork> no
[03:54:06] <Cork> gender[] does that for you
[03:54:22] <Cork> gender[] makes the server see the params an an array of values
[03:55:25] <Duikb00t> So I should set them to [] all the names?
[03:55:41] <Cork> all the names that is dynamic yes
[03:55:56] <Cork> or rather all that can occur multiple times
[03:57:43] <Duikb00t> So like this is prefect? http://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/20j6xugr/
[03:57:48] <nuge> anyone familliar here with dropzone and jquery?
[03:58:18] <Cork> Duikb00t: not sure about perfect, but it should work
[04:00:13] <Duikb00t> What is then the perfect approach?
[04:01:59] <nuge> I'm a little unsure on what the $('file').dropzone lie does exactly (see http://jsfiddle.net/4jwfp8kL/1/)
[04:04:59] <fromers> NUGE ?
[04:05:11] <fromers> nuge ? what are you trying to do ?
[04:05:28] <nuge> I'm trying to get 2 instances of the control, but have different properties for each.
[04:05:43] <nuge> but the text that appears is established in the constructor for the control
[04:06:01] <nuge> in this case the dropzone.js (drag and drop file uploader)
[04:06:27] <nuge> I'm new to jquery and am a little confiused on how the selectors and parameters are called
[04:06:54] <nuge> $('#file-multi') should select the second control in my example, no?
[04:07:31] <fromers> yeah
[04:08:24] <nuge> is there a way to verify that the page-load function is correct?  I'm trying 	 $("#file-multi").hide() which I'm assuming should hide the second control
[04:08:44] <nuge> but both still appear (so I'm wodnering if my function that specifies the overrides is being called)
[04:09:45] <fromers> Can't see where you are calling hide
[04:09:50] <fromers> in the fiddle
[04:10:08] <Germanaz0> this is hidden ==>
[04:10:40] <nuge> updated
[04:10:49] <nuge> http://jsfiddle.net/4jwfp8kL/2/
[04:12:19] <nuge> shouldn't that 3rd command hide it?
[04:12:21] <fromers> http://jsfiddle.net/4jwfp8kL/6/
[04:12:41] <fromers> There was a syntax error in your previous command
[04:13:02] <fromers> Oh and also you didn't setup fiddler to use jquery
[04:13:03] <nuge> oh - the comma
[04:13:19] <nuge> oh - i didn't realize I had to do that
[04:13:51] <fromers> If you are using chrome CTRL+SHIFT+I will open the development tools, the console will show the error as well
[04:16:50] <nuge> thanks frommers - i get the flow now
[04:17:49] <nuge> but the defaults in the javascript override my settings (included in the JS file); does the calls in the $(function) block always get executed last before rendering?
[04:18:00] <fromers> nuge: I haven't used dropzone but checked the docs. try something like this
[04:18:23] <fromers> http://jsfiddle.net/4jwfp8kL/11/
[04:21:18] <fromers> nuge: http://www.dropzonejs.com/#tips
[04:23:17] <nuge> frommers - thanks, i didn't even catch that gotcha
[04:23:33] <fromers> no problem
[04:24:55] <nuge> frommers - move the function call to the bottom (just before my </body> tag fixed it
[04:25:22] <nuge> i though the function calls should appear at teh top of the page (as part of the head block) - is that incorrect?
[04:26:39] <fromers> I normally put the external files at the top, and then js at the bottom
[04:27:03] <nuge> i guess tghat ensures that all the objects referenced exist in the dom then
[04:27:13] <fromers> Can't remember exactly why I think there is a reason
[04:27:32] <nuge> awesome.  thanks for the help, much appreciated
[04:28:07] <fromers> nuge: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1638670/javascript-at-bottom-top-of-web-page
[04:30:13] <nuge> awesome.  really thanks, i was pulling hair out trying to get this working. :)
[04:31:24] <fromers> no problem
[04:33:51] <sKylo> what is a good jquery plugin to make use of a parallax background effect? I used stellar.js but it seems buggy on many devices
[04:56:49] <surianup> Hi all
[04:57:06] <surianup> hope you all are doing well
[04:57:20] <surianup> I need a quick help please
[04:58:11] <surianup> I am calling a iframe from other site and I need to remove the some inner content of that iframe if possible
[04:58:26] <surianup> I have tried But didn't work for me
[04:58:51] <surianup> can you please help me to solve that issue
[05:01:31] <surianup> anyone is there
[05:01:32] <surianup> ?
[05:04:09] <sKylo> you cant alter iframes, and it isn't even legal in most states
[05:04:12] <sKylo> counties
[05:04:37] <sKylo> you might call the other website owner to write an API for you, if you need to do something with the data.
[05:04:50] <sKylo> @ surfdue
[05:05:00] <sKylo> @ surianup , i mean
[05:06:17] <surianup> sKylo actually i am displaying the vimeo video on my home page and I need to disable the play button and progess bar on that
[05:06:23] <surianup> can I remove it
[05:06:36] <sacho_> not unless they've provided an api to do so.
[05:06:38] <surianup> I have not got the solution for this
[05:06:53] <sacho_> maybe they allow configuring the video player via the iframe's url, or they let you post messages to the iframe.
[05:07:01] <surianup> they want a paid account
[05:07:12] <surianup> we have to paid for this
[05:08:14] <sacho_> the fiends.
[05:08:22] <surianup> they are not proving such kind of prameter on the url as U have read about it for disable button
[05:09:00] <surianup> but we ca autohide the button but it will  display when we hover
[05:15:51] <fromers> surianup : here's a hack
[05:15:52] <fromers> http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menu/cssplay-vimeo-hide-control-bar.html
[05:28:29] <nuge> if a jquery module supports events, how do you wire it in when the event is fired? (say a simple console.log command)
[05:29:06] <Cork> nuge: uh you mean if the module fires a custom event?
[05:29:28] <nuge> yeah, the dropzonejs module filres a "quecomplete' event when all files are uploaded
[05:29:37] <nuge> i want to log a string when that happens
[05:29:53] <Cork> nuge: just bind it on the element it fires it on
[05:30:00] <Cork> just like a normal "real" event
[05:30:26] <nuge> whats the syntax? and can I do it as part of the initialization function?
[05:30:44] <nuge> the $(function) on the page render
[05:30:57] <fromers> nuge: pass in a function as part of the option
[05:31:06] <fromers> its usally done via a callback
[05:32:11] <fromers> .({queuecomplete: function(){console.log("done");},
[05:32:42] <nuge> I'm still trying to understand callbacks and js - like this? http://jsfiddle.net/12dbdsng/
[05:33:02] <fromers> not quite
[05:34:39] <fromers> oh its using on in the docs...
[05:34:46] <fromers> http://www.dropzonejs.com/#events
[05:37:10] <nuge> like this? this.on("queComplete", function("#file-image") { console.log("Added file."); });
[05:43:11] <fromers> nuge: http://jsfiddle.net/4jwfp8kL/13/
[05:44:34] <nuge> fromers - can it only be assigned when its instantiated? (as part of a new command?)
[05:45:50] <nuge> assigning the event i mean
[05:47:06] <fromers> I normally do it when I instantiate it
[05:49:21] <fromers> but if you instantiate it like this then you can add it later var dz = new Dropzone("#dz"); dz.on("queuecomplete", function(){console.log("done");});
[05:49:36] <fromers> its two different statements...
[06:02:51] <ReScO> if i have a <a> tag that toggles a div and it immediately closes again, what's the usual suspect?
[06:03:27] <decx> sticky button
[06:03:52] <Cork> ReScO: that the url reloads the page
[06:04:13] <Cork> ReScO: most of the time you should use a <button> not a link for actions
[06:04:25] <Cork> unless there is actually an url that does the same thing
[06:16:57] <ReScO> decx, sticky button?
[06:17:11] <decx> listen to cork
[06:19:22] <ReScO> hmm, i used event.stopPropagation() in the .toggle() function, now it breaks..
[06:20:35] <Cork> ReScO: make a fiddle of the question so we can see what you're dealing with
[06:21:58] <ReScO> Cork, there's so much CSS and JS involved, that's as good as impossible for me, i don't even have access to the source files, a coworker who's having this problem asked me and i can't figure it out either
[06:22:17] <Cork> ReScO: and that is one reason why you should reproduce the problem
[06:22:35] <Cork> ReScO: cause you might have so many layers interfering that is is very hard to see where it goes wrong
[06:27:59] <ReScO> the weird thing is, it works on one page, but on the other, it toggles twice
[06:28:19] <Cork> might be you bind the event twice
[06:29:11] <ReScO> Cork, i see jQuery defined twice
[06:29:34] <decx> sounds like a mess already
[06:29:40] <Cork> ya
[06:29:57] <Cork> ReScO: so my recommendation still stands
[06:30:06] <Cork> reduce the page you have to find where the problems comes from
[06:30:17] <Cork> cause just staring at the line you have will most likely not work
[06:44:08] <wpnoob> Hi, anyone know of a nice jquery slider/carousel something that supports divs and have some nice effects like some I have seen but can not find now, mosaic like effect etc?
[06:45:20] <printForever> hey y'all
[06:45:23] <monk12> wpnoob: any of the options if google "jquery carousel slider divs" work out:
[06:45:47] <printForever> I want to select a TAG (div, h1, p...) by the text conent
[06:45:58] <printForever> should I use .text:contain() or something?
[06:46:22] <decx> minimize your selector footprint and then filter()
[06:46:28] <monk12> wpnoob: so you want only html content inside the slider... instead of standard images?
[06:46:53] <printForever> decx, no... I know what I'm doing... just... need the principle
[06:47:25] <wpnoob> monk12: I want images, but the images are 2560px wide. And dont know except for (background-image) on a div how to make it fully responsive and looking correct because if it is less then 2560px wide screen I want the center to be shown and cut away the edges.
[06:47:44] <decx> printForever: .contain() will work but i prefer filter()
[06:47:52] <printForever> wpnoob: use CSS for that
[06:48:15] <printForever> but am I not looking for .text, not... .contain()
[06:48:20] <wpnoob> printForever: Yes, but how would you do that?
[06:48:32] <printForever> because I'm searching for a specific text string
[06:48:49] <muff_potter> I have an ul element that has li elements dynamically generated within it all with the same class. Each li element has a different piece of data (a float), what is the simplest way to go about adding this data together?
[06:48:50] <printForever> wpnoob, FFS google it
[06:49:05] <printForever> https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/
[06:49:37] <printForever> decx, can you whip up an example
[06:49:49] <printForever> I'm not sure how would I use .filter()
[06:52:02] <printForever> how do I select H1 tag that contains text: "Hello"
[06:54:06] <autrilla_> Why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/y98vgbt4/23/
[06:55:43] <monk12> wpnoob: is that image taking up a big portion of the screen? basically the whole background?
[06:56:03] <decx> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/wLuct9fs/
[06:56:04] <wpnoob> Its like 2560 wide but only 320 high
[06:56:20] <flexpaint> is sidr the best jquery hamburger menu?
[06:56:25] <printForever> tnx decx
[06:56:32] <decx> printForever:  that's basicly what contains does too
[06:58:04] <monk12> wpnoob: alot of the slider plugins are responsive already and i think do the css resizing work for you. like http://designscrazed.org/free-responsive-jquery-image-sliders/    bxslider, flexslider, etc.
[06:59:12] <wpnoob> Ok, cool. Nice. will look into it thanks!
[07:02:27] <decx> sliders aren't en vogue anymore
[07:02:53] <decx> people will be saying, brah it's not 2010 anymore soon when they see you sliding
[07:03:04] <autrilla_> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[07:10:25] <arjservo> hi everybody.
[07:10:36] <decx> hello doctor nick
[07:11:03] <decx> autrilla_: $('.nav-farm .a') you have .a instead of a
[07:11:12] <decx> just looked at your fiddle
[07:11:19] <monk12> decx/autrilla_: what would you use instead of a slider? no slider at all and just text content? whats a effective yet interesting (aka interesting enough so Marketing department doesnt complain) way to show content that used to be in sliders?
[07:11:25] <autrilla_> decx, I tried just a too
[07:11:49] <autrilla_> monk12, http://www.creativebloq.com/accessibility-expert-warns-stop-using-carousels-7133778
[07:11:59] <autrilla_> There's a question there on what to use instead
[07:12:03] <decx> autrilla_: a doesnt contain div.nav-zone you want $(this).next
[07:12:34] <autrilla_> decx, where?
[07:12:46] <autrilla_> oh nvm
[07:12:51] <decx> monk12: present the important element on top and the less important below, people are used to scrolling
[07:13:30] <arjservo> decx: can you help me?
[07:13:33] <autrilla_> decx, that would work for just one sub element
[07:13:38] <autrilla_> But I have many :)
[07:14:05] <decx> well that's another scope of complexity not present in your fiddle ;)
[07:14:50] <decx> just ask your question arjservo
[07:15:06] <autrilla_> decx, this should illustrate it better http://jsfiddle.net/y98vgbt4/28/
[07:16:11] <arjservo> decx: ok! :)
[07:16:27] <decx> autrilla_: nextAll or siblings will do
[07:16:45] <arjservo> I create a form with a input ratio with 2 options https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8826584
[07:17:01] <decx> or just stick to a stacked ul like everyone else you goddamn snowflake ;)
[07:17:26] <arjservo> Now, i’m trying to set the correct value based on database value
[07:18:16] <arjservo> but I need to do this by value, because I’m using the same id in both options
[07:18:23] <arjservo> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8826586
[07:18:27] <decx> that's invalid
[07:18:31] <autrilla_> decx, can you collapse stacked uls?
[07:18:40] <autrilla_> Surprisingly this only works for the first level http://jsfiddle.net/y98vgbt4/30/
[07:18:41] <decx> id is an identifier and as such has to be unique
[07:19:34] <decx> autrilla_: you only need the one click function
[07:19:43] <decx> both fire and show/hide
[07:19:56] <ni291187> If you are ready to think of yourself and about your relation to money it is really good, then order right now. http://goo.gl/KMD3CM
[07:20:17] <decx> booh, booh wendy testerburger booh
[07:21:26] <ni291187> If you are ready to think of yourself and about your relation to money it is really good, then order right now. http://goo.gl/KMD3CM
[07:22:29] <arjservo> decx: ok, but in this case I need to check if the value == 0 >> set optionA else set optionB, correct?
[07:23:05] <hanshenrik> is jQuery 1.x still being developed?
[07:23:30] <decx> arjservo: this should be done serverside
[07:23:40] <Cork> hanshenrik: yes
[07:24:08] <hanshenrik> what's the differenced between 1.x and 2.x ? IE6/7/8 ?
[07:24:17] <Cork> yes
[07:24:30] <Cork> and some changes not possible cause of ie<9
[07:24:42] <Cork> like jsonp .fail events
[07:25:04] <decx> the naming scheme is possibly the most needlessly complicated thing about jq
[07:25:17] <Cork> namin scheme?
[07:25:21] <decx> 1.x and 2.x
[07:25:31] <Cork> this is normally what a new major version means
[07:25:57] <Cork> backwards incompatibility
[07:26:05] <decx> jquery legacy and jquery xtreme test better in the 90s target demo ;)
[07:30:13] <hcker2000> hello. I have this bit of code http://laravel.io/bin/bEjma
[07:30:21] <autrilla_> decx, I know. I want one for the first level and the other one for the second level
[07:30:39] <hcker2000> I'm cloning a div on document ready to keep as an unmodifed copy of another dive
[07:30:40] <hcker2000> div
[07:31:12] <hcker2000> then after some changes have happened I want to replace the modified div with the cloned div
[07:31:31] <decx> autrilla_: then you need to specifiy the selector because .nav-farm a will include all descendant a
[07:31:43] <hcker2000> this works but for some reason on third itteration of interacting it keeps the modified state for some reason
[07:32:50] <hcker2000> as you can also see i tried cloning the clone thinking that .replaceWith might be doing some thing to the inital clone
[07:32:52] <autrilla_> decx, oh.. Is this any easier with nested uls?
[07:33:18] <decx> it's easier to have a robust single function for everything regardless of ul or not
[07:35:14] <autrilla_> I think it might be easier with uls
[07:36:24] <muff_potter> I have an ul element that has li elements dynamically generated within it all with the same class. Each li element has a different piece of data (a float), what is the simplest way to go about adding this data together?
[07:39:32] <autrilla_> decx, indeed, much, much easier http://jsfiddle.net/y98vgbt4/33/
[07:40:10] <decx> that's invalid autrilla_
[07:40:16] <decx> ul can only contain li
[07:40:44] <autrilla_> It renders fine on chromium
[07:40:50] <decx> so <li><a>farm</a> <ul>...</ul></li>
[07:40:53] <decx> doesnt matter
[07:41:00] <decx> browser will render the weirdest shit
[07:41:15] <decx> and then the click on that a
[07:43:33] <autrilla_> http://jsfiddle.net/y98vgbt4/35/ works too, but is legal!
[07:44:10] <decx> there you go
[07:45:39] <flexpaint> im getting "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" on line 523 here on my site http://jsfiddle.net/o88ur9tc/ any ideas why?
[07:47:04] <arjservo> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/arjservo/fr5toktf/3/
[07:49:37] <Cork> flexpaint: and you
[07:49:45] <Cork> *you're loading it the same way?
[07:50:00] <arjservo> decx:  :) work get element by name
[07:50:38] <arjservo> decx: before I was trying to get by id #element, but doesnt work
[07:50:48] <decx> id has to be unique
[07:50:50] <flexpaint> Cork: no it's in the same order though
[07:50:58] <flexpaint> Cork: http://podliberty.com/liberate/
[07:51:00] <arjservo> decx: yes
[07:51:00] <Cork> flexpaint: same file?
[07:51:09] <arjservo> decx: tks!
[07:51:11] <flexpaint> i did the trigger inline
[07:51:24] <flexpaint> cause drupal wouldn't load it in a file, not sure why...
[07:52:02] <Cork> flexpaint: you never load jPanelMenu
[07:52:52] <flexpaint> ah... yeah that'd be it
[07:53:02] <Cork> -_-'
[07:53:09] <Cork> so the same order was...?
[07:53:12] <flexpaint> i did load it
[07:53:15] <flexpaint> it's just not working
[07:53:22] <Cork> it's not in the page
[07:53:29] <Cork> so no you're not
[07:53:42] <flexpaint> i have scripts[] = 'js/additional/jquery.jpanelmenu.js' in my theme's info file
[07:53:59] <Cork> and where is that suppose to end up in the rendered html?
[07:54:05] <Cork> THAT is what matters
[07:54:13] <Cork> look at the generated html, not the php
[07:54:21] <flexpaint> somewhere in line 30-36 i suspect
[07:54:43] <Cork> well it isn't
[07:55:02] <flexpaint> oh you know what
[07:55:03] <flexpaint> sorry
[07:55:09] <flexpaint> im doing this on localhost. i didn't update the site
[07:55:15] <flexpaint> it's not working locally either though
[07:55:52] <Cork> it might be an async problem, but not possibly to say as you aren't loading it at all right now
[07:56:26] <flexpaint> Cork: i've been switching between sidr and this because neither works. sidr is in there now
[07:56:38] <Cork> sigh... ok?
[07:57:10] <flexpaint> Cork: okay refresh
[07:57:29] <flexpaint> line 35 is the script
[07:57:33] <autrilla_> decx, weirdly enough it works on jsfiddle but not on my .html file D:
[07:57:52] <autrilla_> I included the raw JS within <script></script>, maybe that's bad.
[07:58:03] <decx> in the head?
[07:58:24] <Cork> flexpaint: yous site is broken
[07:58:33] <Cork> you don't have a head section
[07:58:51] <Cork> *your site
[07:58:56] <autrilla_> decx, yup
[07:59:26] <autrilla_> If it helps https://gist.github.com/autrilla/189e13cd51dabb405e5a
[07:59:44] <decx> well those are the basics
[07:59:49] <decx> cmon you can do it ;)
[08:00:18] <flexpaint> Cork: ah okay. fixed that. same error though
[08:00:46] <Cork> flexpaint: the link and meta should be inside the head
[08:00:49] <Cork> not in <html>
[08:01:03] <Cork> basically head should start on line 3
[08:01:39] <flexpaint> Cork: oops. fixed. still there though
[08:01:50] <Cork> flexpaint: also you load two versions of jquery
[08:02:01] <Cork> 1.10.2 and 2.1.3
[08:02:25] <flexpaint> you think thats causing it?
[08:02:34] <Cork> its a big possibility
[08:02:48] <Cork> plugins easily break if you load multiple versions of jquery
[08:03:31] <Cork> if you want 1.10.2 for legacy browsers use conditional comments for ie <9
[08:03:56] <flexpaint> Cork: will this only work with 2? 1 is loaded by bootstrap i think
[08:04:07] <flexpaint> and taking out 2 gives cannot read property
[08:04:26] <Cork> flexpaint: 1.10 is the one with legacy support
[08:04:37] <flexpaint> i wonder why bootstrap wants it
[08:04:44] <Cork> so if you don't explicitly want 2.1 you can just remove that one
[08:04:51] <Cork> 1.10 should work just fine
[08:04:53] <flexpaint> i took out 2
[08:04:59] <flexpaint> it gives cannot read property now
[08:05:51] <autrilla_> decx, I can't :(
[08:05:52] <flexpaint> on the same line too.. weird
[08:05:57] * autrilla_ starts crying desperately
[08:05:57] <Cork> flexpaint: something runs noConflict()
[08:06:11] <Cork> flexpaint: use jQuery or jQuery(function($) {}) around your code
[08:06:33] <Cork> meaning use jQuery instead of $ or wrap it in the second solution
[08:06:41] <Cork> anyway i gtg
[08:06:52] <flexpaint> okay i appreciate the help

[08:12:13] <oddvar> I think you need : allData["imgur"] = []
[08:12:15] <autrilla_> Can't you just put raw JS code in between <script> tags?
[08:12:25] <oddvar> oh this is #jquery, ignore me
[08:12:28] <flexpaint> anyone know which part of this i need to replace with what cork mentioned? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d7286d926f397d555031

[08:21:35] <oddvar> Omar-,  true
[08:23:41] <autrilla_> decx, why does the JS need to be in the body and not in the head?
[08:25:47] <flexpaint> can someone help me figure out why im getting this error http://podliberty.com/liberate/
[08:28:00] <quess> why won't my page load again when I have #tab2 on link? its doesn't open my other tab on same page.

[08:33:41] <flexpaint> or is it every $?

[08:34:33] <quess> but wont open it if another tab is selected
[08:35:12] <deepy> flexpaint: try it and se
[08:35:12] <deepy> e
[08:35:35] <flexpaint> deepy: i tried 1 alone, 2 alone, 1 and 2 together, and all $'s but none worked
[08:35:51] <flexpaint> 1 and 12 *
[08:36:15] <deepy> Then you know the answer
[08:36:29] <flexpaint> well someone here said i needed to do that on something
[08:36:33] <flexpaint> i just dont know what...
[08:36:44] <flexpaint> or why tbh
[08:38:08] <flexpaint> im getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jPanelMenu' of undefined" on line 523 http://jsfiddle.net/o88ur9tc/
[08:48:35] <quess> someone help

[09:00:38] <decx> some clearfloat shenanigans

[09:08:38] <KalmaneCKN> Hello. I am Chinmaya studying computer science engineering. I am interested in contributing to the jquery foundation in this Coocle Summer of Code 2015. I am familiar with HTML and CSS. I am interested in contributing to this project. Can someone please guide me?? Thank you.

[09:35:23] <Omar-> when I run init() on "pagecreate" event (jQM custom event) I dont get that event when I console.log(event) within init()
[09:35:30] <Omar-> $(document).on("pagecreate", init);
[09:47:05] <Omar-> why does .data() read and write data-attribute but doesn't update it in DOM? I know .attr("data-foo") can be used too. My question is which one to use, .data() or .attr("data-")?
[09:47:22] <decx> you dont need to update the dom
[09:47:30] <decx> always use data()
[09:47:57] <decx> it'll create a cached reference in $._data to speed things up
[09:48:06] <decx> or was it $._cache
[09:48:14] <decx> one of those things that you never touch
[09:48:15] <Omar-> so it's better
[09:48:26] <decx> yes
[09:48:38] <Omar-> thanks decx :)
[09:48:42] <decx> the data-attribute is read on load to create datasets
[09:48:58] <decx> the attribute itself isnt very handy
[09:49:14] <decx> in a dataset you can actually save references, objects and all kinds of stuff
[09:49:42] <tasaif> One use case for updating the attribute is being able to select it with css
[09:50:08] <decx> yeah but then you might as well add a class and have a performant selector
[09:50:26] <decx> there is a usecase with content: attr

[09:51:07] <CocoStorm> Hi, does anyone know why .html() on some html with inline javascript would be breaking my page?

[10:01:58] <AssassinsMod> is it possible to use jquery in webstorm?
[10:03:56] <ckipping> hi guys, i am using jquery-ui via bower and was wondering half of the afternoon why the jquery.ui.theme.min.css does not contain half of the content of the unminified version jquery.ui.theme.css
[10:16:04] <wahibdon> so I have $('nolink').text("sometext")  but this does not appear to work in chrome on android.  is this a known issue?
[10:16:53] <snover> what do you think that line of code is going to do?
[10:17:26] <wahibdon> in my desktop browser it sets the text of the element.
[10:17:32] <wahibdon> is that not what it should do?
[10:21:08] <wahibdon> should I use html() instead of .text()
[10:25:53] <wahibdon> never mind.  it was the unicode ▸ that is the problem
[10:30:08] <StanAccy> Is there a way to insert/add new elements within a set of selected elements at the beginning of the list of children?
[10:30:50] <StanAccy> Ive selected all the <li> within a list, where each <li> has a series of <divs>.  Id like to add a new element before all the child divs
[10:31:20] <shoky> `api prepend
[10:31:20] <b-ot> shoky: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[10:31:52] <StanAccy> Ah - thanks.  Id tried before, after, append and insert
[10:32:05] <decx> that's not at all what i pictured from the description
[10:34:54] <sadtaco> So, what's the feeling on adding arbitrary attributes to html elements?  Like <div someAttribute="value">?
[10:35:04] <sadtaco> I tend to avoid it but I have a case where I really want to.
[10:35:15] <decx> data-attributes are made for that
[10:35:25] <decx> eg data-someAttribute
[10:40:01] <Seedmanc> Is there any way to find that an object has duplicating keys? I mean after it was created only one key remains among the duplicates, the last one.
[10:41:30] <decx> you loop through it and check
[10:42:05] <sadtaco> decx, yeah I could do with those but what is so bad about arbitrary html attributes?
[10:42:31] <sadtaco> I really hate how unimplicite .data() is.
[10:43:07] <decx> data is awesome you heathen
[10:44:04] <sadtaco> .data is incredibly unclear when you're looking at the dom. :/
[10:44:43] <sadtaco> And just seems difficult to read and maintain.
[10:44:47] <decx> it's caching in $._cache to give you more options on what to do with it (objects, references)
[10:52:19] <Seedmanc> But I mean for an object like a={'one':1,'two':2, 'two':3}; it would have only two properties.
[10:52:53] <Seedmanc> Is there a way to find out that keys were duplicating?
[10:53:52] <decx> the object will take the last one anyway
[10:57:19] <Seedmanc> I just thought I need to warn user that duplicates exist. But I guess there's no way to do that on runtime, you'd have to check the code before execution.
[10:57:52] <muff_potter> I have an ul element that has li elements dynamically generated within it all with the same class. Each li element has a different piece of data (a float), what is the simplest way to go about adding this data together?
[11:04:11] <decx> map it into an array
[11:04:43] <sadtaco> seedmanc, you can set setters in the object and then add some code that sees when it's being replaced
[11:10:28] <Seedmanc> Looks like it can only be assigne to specific property, is there a way to run checks when any property is created?
[11:11:35] <Seedmanc> Basically I have a userscript where the user is supposed to enter data as an object by modifying the script text first time after install.
[11:17:14] <sadtaco> Not sure
[12:03:59] <msoa> hi
[12:04:31] <msoa> is possible defining anonymous function like php in jquey?
[12:05:07] <msoa> like this:
[12:05:08] <msoa> $('#element').function(){}
[12:05:17] <NoiseEee> what do you mean php
[12:05:20] <NoiseEee> php is on the server
[12:05:29] <msoa> no
[12:05:44] <msoa> i want anonymous funciton in jquery
[12:05:51] <msoa> $('#element').function(){}
[12:05:51] <NoiseEee> well yes of course
[12:06:05] <msoa> above code is correct?
[12:06:07] <NoiseEee> but what would that ^^ do in your mind?
[12:06:42] <msoa> i want trigger a function immediately.
[12:06:52] <NoiseEee> so just call it
[12:06:52] <msoa> i no require event.
[12:07:13] <msoa> this is correct?
[12:07:14] <NoiseEee> someFunction()
[12:07:30] <msoa> $('#element').function(){  //do some  }
[12:07:42] <decx> no
[12:08:05] <NoiseEee> perhaps you want to write a function that takes an element?
[12:08:14] <msoa> yes
[12:08:16] <decx> if you want to do something with a collection use each, if you want to do somethign with a single item just use it inside a normal function
[12:08:58] <decx> for a custom method i suggets http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[12:09:17] <msoa> like this:  $('#element').each(){ function(){} }
[12:09:28] <decx> no
[12:11:14] <jphase> should never have more than one element with an id selector like that anyhow unless you have bad markup ;]
[12:11:18] <msoa> thanks
[12:11:19] <msoa> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[12:11:23] <msoa> was useful

[12:21:46] <BillCriswell> I think you're looking for an accordion, but that's your right haha
[12:21:52] <decx> it's called a spinwheel
[12:21:55] <[Non]> oh
[12:22:01] <decx> you can use input type="number" in new browsers
[12:22:01] <[Non]> left? lol
[12:23:04] <msoa> @NoiseEee thanks
[12:23:04] <msoa> solved
[12:23:11] <msoa> and tanks other friends
[12:23:16] <BillCriswell> kirank: Is there an error in the console?
[12:25:12] <kirank> There isn't the browser just freezes
[12:26:07] <scrandaddy> Hey there. Is it possible to define styles for selectors inline on an element in jquery?
[12:26:27] <scrandaddy> <div style="a.myLink { color: yellow }"><a href="">I'm Yellow</a></div> something along those lines?
[12:26:54] <decx> no
[12:27:17] <NoiseEee> but of a funny question there scrandaddy
[12:27:23] <NoiseEee> s/but/bit/
[12:27:50] <BillCriswell> You can use a scoped style but somethign still feels weird about the whole thing.
[12:27:58] <decx> well we certainly have a different opinion on fun then ^^
[12:28:24] <decx> talking about fun, i'm still watching good times, it's good times
[12:28:31] <decx> thanks bill
[12:28:41] <BillCriswell> decx: haha no problem!

[12:29:50] <NoiseEee> geez me too
[12:29:54] <bttf> hello, I am doing a $.post() which is responded with a redirect. it seems my callback function is getting data back of the page that is being redirected to. how can i properly load the new page with all of its HTML ?
[12:29:57] <BillCriswell> decx: I never found a need for it lol
[12:30:33] <decx> yeah i'm so used to class creep that i wouldnt need it
[12:31:02] <BillCriswell> Not to mention if a browser doesn't support it, it can really mess some things up.
[12:32:41] <kirank> BillCriswell: did you find something ?
[12:33:52] <BillCriswell> kirank: I gave it a quick look with no luck. I'd need to see something live probably.
[12:34:23] <kirank> BillCriswell:  ok  thanx I will send you a link later
[12:57:51] <Zeranoe> I would like to set up a web page that cycles (fades) though several different websites. Would this be easiest with the use of iframes and .fadein() ?
[13:11:04] <blakespot> can I do this? $(".myclass.auto50class".each(func...    ?
[13:11:08] <blakespot> listing two classnames
[13:11:14] <blakespot> as target
[13:16:45] <muff_potter> I have an ul element that has li elements dynamically generated within it all with the same class. Each li element has a different piece of data (a float), what is the simplest way to go about adding this data together?
[13:16:47] <muff_potter> I have an ul element that has li elements dynamically generated within it all with the same class. Each li element has a different piece of data (a float), what is the simplest way to go about adding this data together?
[13:19:04] <decx> mylis.map(function(){ return $(this).data('float') }).get().reduce(function(a,b) { return a+b })
[13:24:22] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').get().reduce(function (a, b) { return a + $(b).data('float'); }, 0); ?
[13:26:02] <BillCriswell> Why do I feel liek map then reduce would be better?
[13:27:03] <decx> because that data business in reduce is hella confusing
[13:27:41] <BillCriswell> 8-)
[13:27:46] <BillCriswell> i'm tired
[13:27:58] <decx> hey it works and it's shorter
[13:28:08] <decx> you go girl
[13:28:30] <BillCriswell> haha
[13:29:55] <sacho> uhh
[13:29:59] <sacho> there's a reduce on nodelists?
[13:30:13] <BillCriswell> I think .get() would just return an array
[13:30:14] <sacho> oh, jquery probably returns an array
[13:30:19] <BillCriswell> yesh
[13:30:25] <decx> indeed
[13:30:44] <BillCriswell> indubitibly
[13:31:09] <BillCriswell> indubitably *
[13:31:21] <BillCriswell> i learned that word from ninja turtles.
[13:32:18] <NinjaBanjo> BillCriswell: you asked for a ninja?
[13:32:38] <BillCriswell> haha
[13:33:02] * NinjaBanjo was hilighted
[13:37:02] <grodt> hello
[13:37:12] <grodt> anyone worked with infinite scroll, static content?
[13:41:32] <ReScO> what is the appropriate mime type for a Putty private key
[13:43:57] <AssassinsMod> sorry, can't help you
[13:49:26] <NoiseEee> ReScO: whats yr question about?
[13:52:11] <ReScO> NoiseEee: trying to see if i can get a private key that's generated by a PHP script and passed back as a string in a $.POST().done() to download
[13:54:27] <ReScO> Any ideas?
[13:57:20] <AssassinsMod> and where's the problem?
[13:58:12] <AssassinsMod> wait, if you need to load a page's content can't you just $.get( url ).done( callback ).fail( errorHandler );
[13:58:13] <AssassinsMod> ?
[13:58:26] <AssassinsMod> where the errorhandler func could be something like:function errorHandler( jqxhr, text, error ) {
[13:58:26] <AssassinsMod> 	console.log( '[Error] ' + text + ', ' + error );
[13:58:26] <AssassinsMod> }
[13:58:48] <AssassinsMod> (sorry for the spam)
[13:59:07] <NoiseEee> ReScO: well its insanely insecure unless you're on a https site
[13:59:27] <ReScO> it's on https
[14:01:25] <[Non]> its strange
[14:01:32] <[Non]> when i debug the code, function seems to work
[14:01:35] <[Non]> but when i dont
[14:01:43] <[Non]> jquery codes doesnt work and give me nothing
[14:01:46] <StanAccy> Is there any way for a parent element to prevent clicks being delivered to a child element?
[14:01:47] <[Non]> no error
[14:01:51] <StanAccy> see: https://jsfiddle.net/a3Lbd7xn/5/
[14:02:00] <Ikarus_> How i can set css attribute to elements created dinamically?
[14:02:05] <[Non]> what could possibly cause this?
[14:02:54] <ReScO> StanAccy: event.disablePropagation() ?
[14:04:33] <AssassinsMod> Ikarus_ if you have something like var elem = $( parent ).append( "..." ) you can just say elem.css({attrib: "value"...});
[14:04:49] <AssassinsMod> maybe
[14:04:49] <StanAccy> ReScO: But Im seeing (in the jsfiddle), that the child *always* gets the event first
[14:04:54] <StanAccy> (which makes sense to me)
[14:05:10] <StanAccy> however, in a real program, Im seeing that some parent Ajax click handler is preventing any click from going to its children
[14:05:20] <AssassinsMod> Ikarus_ i said something definitely wrong
[14:05:23] <ReScO> hm, idk
[14:05:27] <StanAccy> and Im trying to understand how its doing that, since I cant recreate that behavior
[14:05:31] <ReScO> NoiseEee: trying to see if i can get a private key that's generated by a PHP script and passed back as a string in a $.POST().done() to download
[14:05:50] <ReScO> NoiseEee: And i have HTTPS
[14:07:55] <AssassinsMod> Ikarus_: depends on how you create that element, i think you should to retrieve it classicaly with a selector
[14:18:48] <muff_potter> I have an ul element that has li elements dynamically generated within it all with the same class. Each li element has a different piece of data (a float), what is the simplest way to go about adding this data together?
[14:22:04] <ReScO> I'm trying to see if i can get a private key that's generated by a PHP script and passed back as a string in a $.POST().done() to download, how can i do this? i have https
[14:39:17] <NoiseEee> ReScO: you'd have to use PHP to send the file, and use JS to open that in a new window
[14:39:54] <ReScO> i know php has to send the file
[14:40:12] <NoiseEee> ReScO: the only way the browser is going to "download" anything is by going to a URL
[14:40:15] <ReScO> but how do i make the download confirmation window pop up? a data:// url?
[14:40:50] <decx> there's a download attribute
[14:41:51] <ReScO> decx ?
[14:42:42] <decx> i read more than your last line and that probably doesnt apply here ^^
[14:47:53] <NoiseEee> ReScO: yeah i think on your server you'd need to set the mime-type for '.key' or whatever to prompt a download, and then window.open('http://site.org/path/to/private.key')
[14:48:23] <ReScO> NoiseEee: i'm not sending a file
[14:49:44] <NoiseEee> ReScO: but you have to
[14:49:48] <NoiseEee> the file is the key
[14:50:04] <ReScO> the PHP part will not output a file, it outputs a string, i don't want to store that string in a file just to have someone download it through jQuery, i want to use the .POST().done(data) data part, which contains the SSH key, as a download directly
[14:50:45] <ReScO> so i was thinking, a data:// url, or filling the html of a iframe dynamically, with a proper mime type set
[15:17:10] <Synthead> jquery UI's menu, is there a way to detect if the item clicked is on one of the last pages (with no submenus)?
[15:21:25] <kevireilly> Hola. I'm trying to hypothesize what scenarios might cause a memory leak with a el.hide() / el.show() routine and the only thing I can think of is that something unknown to me is leaking when it can't find the element visible. Can anyone think of any other potential explanations?
[15:22:35] <kevireilly> seems that replacing it with .css('visibility', 'hidden') [or visible] has solved the issue, but I feel like I'm just masking a potentially legitimate issue
[15:23:31] <grodt> Omnipot, sup nikka
[16:33:45] <SmashingX2> hey guys do you know how can I add a scrollbar to a popup?

[17:54:38] <samuel__> i can't for the life of me figure out why my jquery click event isn't working
[17:54:38] <samuel__> http://pastebin.com/JBjeCnLZ
[17:58:02] <willharrison> I have a bunch of ajax functions that are starting to pile up, is there a good practice to make them more concise? http://laravel.io/bin/E3eoE
[18:06:27] <samuel__> willharrison, is it all for one page?
[18:07:20] <willharrison> atm it is, but I feel like it will end up being used for multiple pages
[18:07:24] <willharrison> samuel__
[18:08:17] <samuel__> It's not that bad
[18:08:31] <samuel__> I think 300 lines is out of control
[18:08:38] <samuel__> or 500
[18:08:41] <samuel__> but 100, not bad
[18:09:49] <willharrison> samuel__ yeah that's how I feel but I am going to have to add more I know
[18:10:00] <willharrison> and I just feel like it will eventually get out of hand
[18:10:09] <willharrison> want to nip it in the bud now lol
[18:12:46] <samuel__> just create functions then.
[18:12:51] <samuel__> you're doing mostly the same thing.
[18:13:03] <samuel__> just pass through the parameters that differentiate them
[18:13:13] <samuel__> like the url
[18:13:19] <samuel__> class
[18:13:28] <samuel__> and such
[18:13:33] <samuel__> make sense?
[18:15:21] <willharrison> yeah
[18:16:08] <willharrison> I am going to ask you another question in a minute,  I was on the phone will I was typing so my mind got scrambled, but it was something related to the creating functions
[18:19:15] <guzzlefry> Does a $.ajax() call with method set to GET automatically build a query string?
[18:20:36] <rcyr> guzzlefry: If you set its "data" config option, yes.
[18:20:44] <guzzlefry> nice, thank you
[18:31:42] <guzzlefry> err, it doesn't seem to be doing that.
[18:32:17] <guzzlefry> http://dpaste.com/3K4GEC4
[18:53:40] <guzzlefry> Nevermind, I was being dumb with that. Is there a way to give context to the .done callback on the $.ajax() call?
[18:55:19] <guzzlefry> oh, I see a context option. Trying content: this >_>
[18:55:23] <guzzlefry> context even
[18:57:49] <guzzlefry> And, that doesn't work
[18:58:46] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: What are you tyring to do??
[19:00:19] <guzzlefry> BillCriswell: Basically, I have a bunch of images that are processed asychronously. So I'm doing $('image.processing').each($.ajax()...); In the .done() function I need to access 'this' in order to actually modify each image.
[19:01:42] <guzzlefry> Pretty sure I was being dumb again. I should probably stop for today.
[19:02:39] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: If you're doing each you can just do .each(function() { var $img = $(this); then use $img inside the ajax call.
[19:03:50] <guzzlefry> ah, BillCriswell, I ended up using the context option. It wasn't working at first because I put it in the data option object instead. :)
[19:04:12] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[19:09:35] <grodt> sup
[19:10:49] <willharrison> I am getting an undefined variable error on lines 54-56 http://laravel.io/bin/PX3r5#1-16,54-56
[19:10:55] <willharrison> anyone know what might be causing this?
[19:11:53] <BillCriswell> willharrison: scope.
[19:12:23] <grodt> BillCriswell, be nice
[19:12:36] <BillCriswell> I am.
[19:12:40] <willharrison> BillCriswell why am I not having a problem with ajaxHelper?  because I am using prototype with it?
[19:13:08] <willharrison> BillCriswell nvm, I am having a problem with ajaxHelper
[19:13:19] <willharrison> ignore my words
[19:13:27] <willharrison> i'll go back to my editor now
[19:13:44] <BillCriswell> willharrison: Haha good luck!
