[04:32:44] <snfgf> HEY GUYS
[04:33:19] <snfgf> can i use a wildcard as a selector, for example, $(this).parents('group_*')?
[04:35:30] <Popzi> myresponse = [["my", "information], ["in this","format"]]     how can I get the 2nd half of each entry? (information and format)   JSON.parse(myresponse[1])  or something?
[04:39:19] <Popzi> JSON.parse(myresponse:eq(2)) ?
[04:42:41] <Cork> Popzi: are you looking for $.map(response, function(elm) { return elm[1]; }) ?
[04:43:10] <snfgf> HELLO
[04:43:27] <snfgf> how do I get jquery object N from a jquery set of matched elements?
[04:43:43] <Cork> snfgf: .eq()
[04:43:51] <snfgf> damn
[04:43:52] <snfgf> thanks
[04:43:56] <snfgf> i have been told this before lol
[04:43:56] <Popzi> Cork no idea, I come from a python background, in python you would do   for x in list print(x[1])  to get the 2nd value of each array entry, If that jquery code will get the 2nd value from each array entry, then yes that's what im looking for :P
[04:45:28] <Cork> Popzi: var responses = [["my", "information"], ["in this","format"]]; $.map(responses, function(elm) { return elm[1]; }) == ["information", "format"]
[04:46:20] <Cork> Popzi: depending what you want to do with it $.each might be what you want
[04:46:36] <Popzi> Cork ah, oki, I'll give it a shot :) Thanks for your help! :)
[04:46:54] <Uhkis> Popzi: do i know you? :D
[04:47:25] <Cork> Popzi: there isn't any deconstructors in ecmascript pre es6
[04:47:41] <Popzi> Uhkis: hmmmmmmmmm I don't think so, I'm around alot of the irc channels, mostly python, reddit-sysadmin, sql, linux, and a few others ;P
[04:47:44] <Cork> so you have to loop them and construct a new array if you want it (that is what $.map does)
[04:48:12] <Uhkis> Popzi: oh, thought that would be a really unique nickname, apparently it's not :)
[04:48:14] <Popzi> Cork okay :) thanks for your informative response ^_^ fantastic help :)
[04:49:16] <Popzi> Uhkis: registered on freenode and soundcloud, not as popular of a name as I first thought tbh :)
[04:51:36] <snfgf> what is better for ajax, complete: in the object paramenter or, using .done?
[04:53:12] <Uhkis> snfgf: coders choice, i prefer .done()
[04:54:37] <snfgf> ty
[06:00:10] <Tantza55> hello. i have a question. i'm trying to create a svg editor using jquery, and so far i can add different geometric shapes, but i want to be able to add text written in a textarea too inside the svg
[06:04:13] <cdunklau> hi folks. I'm having issues with jQuery.when and ajax deferreds... here's a reproduction https://gist.github.com/cdunklau/a6c5bb0e5a9681d6c31019def09dfd98
[06:04:54] <Tantza55> i added a textarea, linked to the event of pressing the enter button, but i don't know how am i supposed to send that text so it would be displayed in the svg
[06:06:04] <cdunklau> i expect that jQuery.when will resolve consistantly to the result of the deferreds, but it looks like it resolves each of the child deferreds to an array of three values when i give .when more than one deferred. is this a bug, or is the inconsistancy documented anywhere?
[06:06:08] <cdunklau> it's quite confusing
[06:24:38] <cdunklau> and it's worse than i thought... this only appears to happen with ajax deferreds
[06:34:03] <dglambert> morning
[06:35:37] <cdunklau> oh, it is documented, just at the end of the jquery.when cods
[06:35:39] <cdunklau> docs*
[07:43:27] <Tantza55> what function should i use for updating the svg's content?
[07:44:24] <jRegular> Hello there, considering I have two inputs ( email and verifEmail) I would like my verifEmail input goes red/orange/yellow/green depending on how close the comparaison gets, how could I do that ?
[07:45:33] <jRegular> I've already try that : http://pastebin.com/tpmPRdP1  which actually works fine but only in the case the user doesn't do mistakes ahah
[07:46:12] <jRegular> The problem is that if he goes wrong at the beginning, everything in the for statement is displaced
[08:04:38] <Cork> Tantza55: you can use just normal jquery
[08:05:21] <Cork> Tantza55: you will have to be careful when interacting though as svg isn't html so you will have some cross document pitfalls
[08:06:06] <Cork> jRegular: not sure what yellow would ever be
[08:06:16] <Cork> percent of character existing in both?
[08:06:32] <Cork> normally those only check match or not
[08:08:46] <Tantza55> Cork: my fiddle is https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/14/ as you can see i have a textarea declared in html. the gray area is SVG. i am trying to display the text you write in the textarea in the SVG at the press of enter key
[08:12:46] <Cork> Tantza55: you have an <svg> element inside the <svg> element
[08:12:56] <Cork> and that doesn't look correct
[08:13:27] <Tantza55> Cork: so i should have only one
[08:13:38] <Cork> Tantza55: ya, it makes no sense
[08:13:47] <Cork> unless you want to embed an external svg
[08:13:55] <Cork> (and then it isn't using that syntax)
[08:15:51] <Cork> Tantza55: i would prob go for https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/15/
[08:17:24] <Tantza55> Cork: https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/17/ i edited it, to have only one svg, thank you
[08:22:00] <jRegular> Cork yeah something like that : percent of matching
[08:22:11] <jRegular> Instead of just matching or not
[08:22:27] <Cork> jRegular: well you will have to figure out exactly how you would want to calculate that
[08:40:57] <MikeD_> percent of matching?  are you using some fuzzy match?
[08:41:17] <jRegular> Nope
[08:41:59] <MikeD_> regex... where you replace each character with a wildcard... until you get a match, confidence is based on how many wildcards you used?  :P
[08:42:02] <jRegular> I have not defined already but it would be something like 0 to 25 / 25 to 50 / 50 to 75 / above 75 and 100%
[08:42:29] <MikeD_> hamming distance between two strings?
[08:42:53] <jRegular> Well, could do  the job but the wildcard should be created dynamically ahaha nother story ;)
[08:43:05] <jRegular> Hamming ? Sry I'm not eglish
[08:43:38] <MikeD_> http://calculator.vhex.net/calculator/distance/hamming-distance
[08:43:43] <jRegular> Oh, okay, well I have not gone deep into Hamming maybe it should do the trick
[08:43:49] <MikeD_> or maybe this is more obvious: http://planetcalc.com/1721/
[08:45:16] <Tantza55> Cork: could you please explain me what should i do to display the text i write in the textarea in the SVG at the press of enter key?
[08:45:46] <jRegular> Levenshtein seems perfect
[08:45:50] <Cork> Tantza55: the fiddle i gave you does it
[08:46:50] <Tantza55> oh, thank you very much, sorry
[10:47:56] <Xatenev> Hi
[10:48:04] <Xatenev> Anybody using jspdf or html2canvas and might help me out quick >(
[11:04:04] <Amplex> Hi there, I am looking for a way to replace content without deleting unchanged parts first.
[11:05:47] <Amplex> For example: original text: updated content 1 ->  .html('updated new content 2'). Internally would do .empty().append(). Is there a way to only update changes / new parts?
[12:04:51] <Deusdeorum> Yo! $('#button').click(function() {} does not work on mobile, SO said $('#button').on('click touch', function () {} but does not work either.. i am failing somewhere?
[12:05:02] <Deusdeorum> both work in browser on computers
[12:16:12] <taplar> Deusdeorum: try touchend rather than touch
[12:16:26] <Deusdeorum> taplar hmm, https://jsfiddle.net/000en887/
[12:16:36] <Deusdeorum> the fiddle actually works on my phone
[12:16:43] <Deusdeorum> must be some cache somewhere sigh
[12:17:00] <Deusdeorum> but why touchend > touch?
[12:17:14] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent
[12:18:17] <taplar> afaik, those are the basic touch events.  other events are library implementations of those to make other custom events
[12:23:35] <Srgjames> What's the best way to do form field validation ?
[12:26:20] <taplar> how do you define 'best'?
[12:27:18] <taplar> and regardless of whatever frontend validation you have, you will still need backend validation
[12:34:39] <SundayJune> Hi all
[12:36:25] <duch_kazatel> hullo!
[12:36:26] <taplar> aloha
[12:38:59] <Deusdeorum> hmm, taplar, you know what, i have a if statement wrapped around my click function which conditions is based on Date(). https://jsfiddle.net/000en887/6/
[12:39:03] <Deusdeorum> does not work on phone
[12:40:44] <taplar> i wonder if you need to do getTime() for your comparison
[12:43:10] <SundayJune> Hi all, can you help me how to compute the value fields. here's my gist https://gist.github.com/JuneDomingo/568b54963755f335c16bf8f3311b6b23
[12:43:26] <Deusdeorum> never seen before, weird, will try
[12:43:35] <Deusdeorum> phones just keep loading the jsfiddle
[12:43:38] <duch_kazatel> SundayJune make a fiddle instead.
[12:43:53] <duch_kazatel> so we can also see your markup.
[12:43:55] <SundayJune> okay, wait
[12:47:11] <Deusdeorum> nopes, getTime(); does not work either, https://jsfiddle.net/000en887/7/
[12:47:43] <SundayJune> duch_kazatel here https://jsfiddle.net/smwkyn5n/
[12:48:15] <duch_kazatel> Deusdeorum https://jsfiddle.net/000en887/8/ maybe the date format you're using is wrong?
[12:48:35] <duch_kazatel> since the click handler seems to be binding just fine...
[12:48:44] <taplar> Deusdeorum: just tried it on my phone and it worked
[12:48:51] <taplar> using my chrome browser
[12:48:54] <Deusdeorum> hmmm wtf..
[12:49:13] <Deusdeorum> but duch_kazatel you do get in the alert if and not in the alert if if you change date so it is working
[12:49:30] <SundayJune> i want to sum the value based on Qty and adding the sponsor amount
[12:49:53] <duch_kazatel> SundayJune okay.  so where are you getting losted?
[12:49:55] <duch_kazatel> *lost
[12:49:58] <Deusdeorum> taplar yes, using chrome browser -> iphone 6 does work
[12:50:27] <duch_kazatel> ah - SundayJune you need to bind an input or change handler to that input and include it.
[12:51:21] <Deusdeorum> but actually using a real phone does not work, tried iphone 7 and iphone 6
[12:51:40] <taplar> 'real phone'?
[12:52:08] <SundayJune> duch_kazatel i don't know how to add if it's not a checkbox.
[12:52:27] <duch_kazatel> you select it and get its val()
[12:52:34] <duch_kazatel> then parseFLoat
[12:53:04] <SundayJune> can you edit my code?
[12:53:18] <duch_kazatel> i could, but that's not really how this channel works :)
[12:53:23] <duch_kazatel> try it first! :D
[12:53:37] <taplar> Deusdeorum: if you were thinking i was using chrome in mobile emulation mode, that's not what I meant.  I did it on my phone with it's chrome app
[12:54:25] <Deusdeorum> oh sorry, that is what i was thinking.. no success here..
[12:55:04] <SundayJune> right. ive been figuring this out about an hours now. I will try it
[12:55:13] <duch_kazatel> awesome!
[12:56:01] <taplar> Deusdeorum: does this change anything? https://jsfiddle.net/000en887/9/
[12:56:41] <Deusdeorum> Yes it does.. but why?
[12:56:56] <taplar> probably your date format
[12:57:02] <taplar> you had 2017-1-11 which isn't ISO
[12:58:00] <Deusdeorum> weird
[12:58:14] <Deusdeorum> so my first fiddles should work if i change dateformat
[12:59:52] <Deusdeorum> aye, anyhow thanks for helping out
[12:59:57] <taplar> np
[13:01:08] <Deusdeorum> and yes, "2017-01-11" works fine :p lol, i got 2017-1-11 extracting it from Date(); i think, hence i used that
[13:02:33] <duch_kazatel> SundayJune you figure it out or need more help?
[13:03:15] <SundayJune> still no idea what to do
[13:03:54] <duch_kazatel> okay, so you need to select that input for the sponsorship field, right?
[13:04:34] <duch_kazatel> looks like it doesn't have anything you can really select on that isn't generic (btw you're repeating id="name" a few times - that's invalid)
[13:04:51] <SundayJune> yes, and also the Qty of the checkboxes
[13:04:59] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you can't do that.
[13:05:13] <duch_kazatel> IDs must be unique.
[13:05:42] <duch_kazatel> also: i'd give that input a class like 'sponsorship-amount' and then select that and go from there.
[13:17:06] <duch_kazatel> SundayJune your freebie for the day: https://jsfiddle.net/smwkyn5n/2/
[13:17:08] <duch_kazatel> heh
[13:22:34] <SundayJune> duch_kazatel Thank you!
[13:23:00] <duch_kazatel> where'd you get stuck fwiw?
[13:26:28] <SundayJune> though i'm getting an NaN when there's no value from sponsor amount field. but i try to figure this out. Thanks again
[13:27:03] <duch_kazatel> oh, because I'm lazy
[13:27:15] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/smwkyn5n/3/
[13:27:17] <duch_kazatel> easy change.
[13:32:34] <_Cthulhu_> Anyone know of a graceful way to upload a text file and put its contents in a textarea using JQuery without having to send it to the server?
[13:33:07] <duch_kazatel> so you just want to read a text file via jQuery?
[13:33:30] <_Cthulhu_> Yes, upload is probably the wrong word there. I just could not find any way to get data into the browser except with file upload
[13:34:00] <_Cthulhu_> I can of course get the file data there. Size, name etc
[13:34:02] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11046919/how-do-i-read-a-text-file-on-my-local-disk-into-a-variable-in-javascript
[13:34:23] <_Cthulhu_> Awesome thank you. Checking that out now
[13:36:16] <_Cthulhu_> duch_kazatel your awesome. I was on the right track, I was just missing the FileReader()
[13:36:51] <duch_kazatel> google (shrug)
[13:37:29] <_Cthulhu_> I had been googling for the last hour. Just had the wrong term since I was thinking in terms of uploading and not local reads
[13:37:29] <_Cthulhu_> lol
[13:37:57] <duch_kazatel> heh
[13:55:31] <Abhimanyu> Hi..
[13:55:39] <duch_kazatel> ohai
[13:56:27] <Abhimanyu> I am willing to contribute to Jquery..where can I sign the CLA and what is the process further ?
[13:56:30] <Abhimanyu> Please help
[13:56:49] <duch_kazatel> You'll be presented with all of that upon submission of your first PR :)
[13:57:16] <duch_kazatel> check out http://contribute.jquery.org/ for other information.  also #jquery-dev is a good resource.
[13:58:54] <Abhimanyu> I am unable to sign the CLA
[13:59:02] <Abhimanyu> where do I need to sign it
[13:59:09] <duch_kazatel> correct - you'll get a link for it when you submit your first PR :)
[13:59:59] <Abhimanyu> Cool..on what projects can I create a PR ?
[14:00:16] <duch_kazatel> any of them.  did you read the contributing site?
[14:00:56] <duch_kazatel> find a ticket, fix it/add it/change it, update/create appropriate unit tests, create pr.
[14:03:40] <Abhimanyu> Okay..on any of the projects on github which are under Jquery tag ????
[14:03:46] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:04:12] <duch_kazatel> the jquery org you mean?
[14:04:14] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery
[14:04:58] <Abhimanyu> Yeah
[14:05:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah so go to a repo, find an issue in the repo, fix it, etc, open a pr, and you should be set.  also make sure you read the CONTRIBUTING.md for the repo as we as the contributing site.
[14:08:16] <Abhimanyu> Cool..thanx man
[14:08:25] <duch_kazatel> YEP
[14:08:28] <duch_kazatel> *yep
[14:34:49] <Deusdeorum> i am back with another browser vs mobile question. i have a function that appends stuffs to a div on: $(this).closest("form").submit(); this works in browser but on mobile it returns the action url of form..
[14:35:09] <Deusdeorum> why? should i do something lik return false; as well?
[14:35:29] <duch_kazatel> what's the desltop one doing?
[14:35:35] <duch_kazatel> and define "returns the action url of form"
[14:35:50] <Deusdeorum> mywebsite.com/action
[14:35:59] <duch_kazatel> still being vauge.
[14:36:15] <duch_kazatel> "returns" as in you're getting back the value of the action?  how so?
[14:36:49] <Deusdeorum> hmm, lets see if i can be more clear lol
[14:37:07] <duch_kazatel> is it going to the new page?
[14:37:08] <duch_kazatel> or...?
[14:38:01] <Deusdeorum> i have this backend of the form that only retrieves the data put it into the DB and return JSON, this works in browser (nothing happens) but on mobile it redirects to the action of the form (action being the url of backend.. "action="/myaction")
[14:38:23] <duch_kazatel> so it goes to the page.
[14:38:28] <Deusdeorum> yes
[14:38:29] <duch_kazatel> what's the event listener you have for submit?
[14:38:40] <duch_kazatel> (that's not a "return" btw)
[14:38:45] <Deusdeorum> $('.div').on('click', 'input[type=radio]', function() { }
[14:38:49] <Deusdeorum> no?
[14:39:01] <duch_kazatel> you want a submit handler.
[14:39:03] <duch_kazatel> not a click handler.
[14:39:21] <Deusdeorum> the submit handler is inside the click handler
[14:39:29] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:39:45] <duch_kazatel> hack up
[14:39:55] <duch_kazatel> *back up - you need to bind to the submit event.
[14:40:01] <duch_kazatel> 'click' is not a submit event.
[14:42:09] <Deusdeorum> http://pastebin.com/3YXts7DQ
[14:42:37] <Deusdeorum> there is lots of forms on this page in .feed so i have to find the closes one of that input click
[14:42:40] <duch_kazatel> i don't know how to phrase it any differently.
[14:43:04] <duch_kazatel> this doesn't prevent the user from going to the new page.
[14:43:21] <duch_kazatel> do you have some kind of ajax dealio somewhere else?
[14:44:17] <Deusdeorum> yes but not being used in this script
[14:44:27] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:44:29] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:44:50] <duch_kazatel> so there'd be a preventdefault or something in your submit handler
[14:44:52] <duch_kazatel> for the the ajax.
[14:45:55] <Deusdeorum> hm.. no ajax being used really..
[14:46:09] <Deusdeorum> sorry for not being clear lol
[14:46:15] <duch_kazatel> so then how is the desktop one submitting without going to the new page?
[14:46:38] <Deusdeorum> on click obviously?
[14:46:52] <duch_kazatel> *without* going to the new page.
[14:46:56] <duch_kazatel> your click triggers a submit.
[14:47:10] <duch_kazatel> nothing about that code prevents the user from going to the action.
[14:47:30] <Deusdeorum> that's my point. In browser you do not go to the action but on mobile you do..
[14:47:36] <duch_kazatel> i don't see how.
[14:47:39] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't be possibke.
[14:47:42] <duch_kazatel> sounds like desktop has a bug.
[14:48:21] <Deusdeorum> ha.. okey, well, okey, but i should do some function(e) e.preventdefault then right?
[14:48:34] <duch_kazatel> in a submit handler, yes.
[14:48:49] <Deusdeorum> aye, thanks
[14:49:07] <Deusdeorum> sorry for not being clear, two languages which i do not fully know :-) (js + eng)
[15:18:52] <Jacob1212> Hey I'm working on a simple player, but I'm new to code so I'm running into a problem. I'm using the font awesome icons and some Jquery to try to turn the player on and off Here is my code and what I see on the page load https://thepasteb.in/p/pghQ17RwBNKtR And https://ibin.co/38RGoFDjDsSZ.jpg
[15:19:49] <Jacob1212> I'm using JQuery to add a class of Hidden-player of the icon that I don't want to show
[15:20:35] <Jacob1212> I just can't get it to hide the image on page load and I don't know the right code
[15:21:25] <taplar> just default the image to have that class on it
[15:21:40] <Jacob1212> oh
[15:22:41] <taplar> if you know something should be presented some way on page load, no reason to load it differently and then change it.  just make it start out how it should be
[15:23:07] <Jacob1212> Okay, that is obvious
[15:23:09] <Jacob1212> sorry
[15:23:16] <taplar> all good, :)
[15:23:21] <Jacob1212> Like I said I'm new :)
[15:29:16] <SideFX> Is there something special to do selectors with multiple levels?  Like if I do $(".content_dropdown li ") everything works but if I do $(".content_dropdown li ul") it doesnt
[15:29:51] <taplar> do you have ul's nested under the li's nested under the content_dropdown?
[15:30:42] <SideFX> I believe so.  I have this in .css .content_dropdown li:hover ul{
[15:31:15] <SideFX> Which works, so I'm trying to make that li ul selector trigger a add class to replicate the css
[15:31:54] <taplar> well, :hover is on the li, so you don't really have to find down to the nested uls
[15:32:04] <taplar> though why make a js version of the css logic?
[15:32:24] <SideFX> so I can put a delay in it so the menu doesn't disappear as soon as you move your mouse off the element
[15:32:33] <taplar> ah
[15:33:00] <taplar> you might could do that with css steps
[15:33:09] <taplar> depending on the effect
[15:33:48] <SideFX> I'd have to re-write the whole site unfortunately, the css works like that for like 20 pages, so I cant' easily modify it in one location
[15:36:34] <taplar> $('.content_dropdown li').hover(function(){ $(this).find('ul').addClass('wee'); }, function(){ setTimeout( function(){ $(this).find('ul').removeClass('wee'); }, 1000); });
[15:36:36] <taplar> or something
[15:37:29] <SideFX> Let me give that a try
[15:37:59] <taplar> you'll probably have to modify the setTimeout callback to handle for if the user leaves hover and re-enters hover before a second has passed
[15:42:38] <SideFX> This still isn't finding it.
[15:42:57] <SideFX> I think something might be conflicting with something, there are like 20 .js files that get loaded onto this site.
[15:43:32] <taplar> what do you get if you do console.log($('.content_dropdown li').length); and console.log($('.content_dropdown li ul').length);
[15:56:26] <Jacob1212> Any one here familiar with word press?
[15:56:58] <Jacob1212> #wordpress
[15:57:26] <taplar> not i.  about the only think i know of them is that they run jQuery in no conflict mode iirc.
[16:01:09] <MassDebates> Jacob1212:  I am familiar with wordpress
[16:01:19] <MassDebates> 144 was better imo
[16:04:51] <Jacob1212> Lol
[16:05:09] <Jacob1212> Good to see you man :)
[17:30:56] <saul> hello i'm looking at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6816981/jquery-for-getting-click-event-on-a-table-row
[17:31:07] <saul> i'm just not quite clear on how i will know which row was clicked
[17:31:28] <saul> depending on the TR that is clicked, i will use that row's data to take an action
[17:52:57] <taplar> $('tableselector').on('click', 'tr', function(){}); <-- inside the handler 'this' will be the row clicked
[17:56:27] <dglambert> night all
[18:01:07] <saul> taplar: thanks!!!!
