[09:28:47] <FancyCamel> Hi there. Relatively simple question - I think. I'm doing some stuff with Prototypes and all. I'm new to this realm. What I am wondering is if I set up a $.fn.foo = function(){ new Blahblah()} and call $('.bar').foo(); is there any way in the prototype function's they can be aware of the state of other instantiated functions?
[09:29:17] <FancyCamel> I'm screwing around with creating an audio player basically and the gist is that I'm hoping to, on a togglePlay event, check if other players are currently playing.
[09:33:02] <shoky> FancyCamel: there's nothing in the prototype function that is aware of others, you'd need to keep track of them yourself
[09:33:22] <FancyCamel> So basically on instantiation populate it into an array that can be looped over and checked I guess?
[09:33:29] <FancyCamel> Thanks shoky :)
[09:33:33] <shoky> sure
[10:16:52] <bjsnider> is 'this' a reserved keyword?
[10:17:53] <bjsnider> i mean if it's not used like $(this), what does it refer to? it's not the current object is it?
[10:19:06] * AdamPDotty waits for it.
[10:26:28] <shoky> bjsnider it's reserved, yes. and yes it's the current object usually, assuming the method was called on the actual object (e.g. obj.method() ).  but it can be changed. go read about it :p
[10:28:01] <bjsnider> what does the $ refer to in (function($) {}(jquery)
[10:28:42] <shoky> bjsnider:  it's the name of the first argument to that function.  and it's being called with jquery as first argument, so it refers to jquery
[10:28:43] <bjsnider> missed a )
[10:28:51] * AdamPDotty counts brackets.
[10:29:06] <bjsnider> ok, well i was right about that one
[10:29:43] <bjsnider> shoky: i would read about it but i'm worried about getting bad information from 'tutorials'
[10:30:40] <shoky> bjsnider: copying info from #Node.js bot-
[10:30:43] <shoky> bjsnider: A function call of the form `a.b()` calls the function with `this` being the value of `a`; in a call of the form `f()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode. Note that arrow functions and functions produced by `Function.prototype.bind` ignore the passed `this` value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[10:31:23] <shoky> then don't read 'tutorials'  ;)
[10:33:04] <bjsnider> ok, so that link would not be jquery-specific
[10:33:46] <bjsnider> arrow functions? never heard of it
[10:36:18] <shoky> `this` is not jquery-specific
[10:36:33] <shoky> arrow functions are not really new anymore, you should learn them :p
[10:37:05] <bjsnider> i'm assuming 'jQuery' works as an arg because the lib is somehow defining itself as that word
[10:37:22] <shoky> indeed
[10:59:13] <Crash1hd> trying to do this {"price-quote":[{"service-code":"DOM.EP”,...},{“service-code":"DOM.PC”,…},{“service-code":"DOM.RP”,...}}]}
[10:59:13] <Crash1hd> $.ajax({url: “file.php", success: function(result){
[10:59:13] <Crash1hd>       console.log(result);
[10:59:13] <Crash1hd>       $.each(result, function(key, value){
[10:59:13] <Crash1hd>         console.log("testing");
[10:59:15] <Crash1hd>       });
[10:59:17] <Crash1hd>     }}); but console.log("Testing") doesn't show up? The console.log(result does) and it looks like the son.  Any advice?
[11:02:10] <pavonia> What type is result?
[11:12:00] <Crash1hd> pavonia, how do I check pretty sure its string
[11:13:10] <pavonia> If it's string then $.each won't work
[11:13:31] <pavonia> each() traverses arrays and objects
[11:19:32] <Crash1hd> Ok that makes sense how can I check?
[11:19:44] <Crash1hd> Oh haha I have to decode the json duh
[11:19:46] <Crash1hd> nevermind
[11:23:13] <Crash1hd> pavonia, thanks again I forgot to add dataType: 'json', to the Ajax call
[11:23:31] <pavonia> No problem
[11:23:47] <pavonia> Also there's `typeof result` to check
[12:14:06] <Crash1hd> pavonia, thanks again :)
[12:39:16] <cableguy> hey team, how do i prevent ajax calling my script. my jquery  loads on page load,  then after user action some ajax process runs and it calls my script again and it ruins everything

[13:46:37] <robertmaxrees> woops
[14:21:24] <FancyCamel> Hey all. Wondered if someone can give a quick piece of advice on this. It may be something stupid - I'm just new to trying to use prototypes and all.
[14:21:25] <FancyCamel> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JBpvgW?editors=0010
[14:22:13] <FancyCamel> The gist of it is that I'm creating an array of the objects created down at new ButtonTest. When one is clicked, I'm just trying to call the methodTest function attached to each of them. I think it's just a silly little thing
[14:22:24] <FancyCamel> I've just been stuck and haven't had much luck with my googling.
[14:22:53] <robertmaxrees> do you see your JS error?
[14:23:23] <FancyCamel> Is there a red exclamation popping up for you?
[14:23:59] <FancyCamel> Or do you mean the undefined property methodTest bit?
[14:24:07] <robertmaxrees> the latter.
[14:24:12] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JBpZoN?editors=0010
[14:24:19] <FancyCamel> Because that's what I'm trying to solve. Like I said I think it's something stupid I'm just not wrapping my head around properly.
[14:24:25] <robertmaxrees> don't use forin, also.
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> forEach fr arrays.
[14:25:05] <robertmaxrees> for...in means you have to do btns[btn], but that's gross.
[14:25:08] <robertmaxrees> use forEach
[14:26:54] <FancyCamel> Thanks! That definitely helps.
[14:27:13] <FancyCamel> I knew it was something stupid of me.
[14:27:19] <FancyCamel> I wasn't using the index.. as an index.
[14:27:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> but also
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> for...in isn't for arrays
[14:27:42] <FancyCamel> Yeah I got you on that as well.
[14:28:00] <FancyCamel> Thanks a ton. :)
[14:31:22] <Haystack78> I have a page with a jquery drag and drop space for files, and some other info to be filled out in the form that updates to the database.  I am running into a problem when someone uploads a file, and then comes back later to change some of the info in the form.  Chrome crashes out with the error: Uncaught TypeError: dropzoneForm.submit is not a fun
[14:31:23] <Haystack78> ction unless they re-select the file to reupload it again.
[14:31:58] <Haystack78> there is nothing with the id or name "submit" in the html
[14:32:30] <robertmaxrees> Haystack78 what does your js look like?
[14:32:55] <robertmaxrees> looks like a callback wasn't specified maybe.
[14:33:55] <Haystack78> http://jsfiddle.net/bw7zd2Lj/
[14:34:41] <Haystack78> chrtome is saying the error is on line 34
[14:34:45] <Haystack78> *chrome
[14:35:36] <robertmaxrees> could you provide the actual JS?
[14:35:42] <robertmaxrees> since url: "@Url.Action("DocsEditor")", is invalid JS ;)
[14:36:10] <Haystack78> you mean the docs editor JS?
[14:36:24] <robertmaxrees> i mean url: "@Url.Action("DocsEditor")", is not a valid line in your js.
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> also: console.log(dropzoneForm) right before that .submit() call
[14:37:13] <robertmaxrees> is that even defined?
[14:37:23] <robertmaxrees> and if so, what is it?
[14:38:22] <Haystack78> I didn't write the code.  Not sure why "@Url.Action("DocsEditor")" is invalid.  It works fine when someone drops a file on the page
[14:38:37] <Haystack78> are you saying the syntax is wrong?
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> is that what's actually on the page?
[14:40:13] <Haystack78> yes this is all copied and pasted from the actual code, which has been running for over a year I think
[14:40:54] <Haystack78> oh shoot, I forgot to mention this is also asp.net mvc
[14:40:57] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/7I4xqOj.png
[14:41:06] <robertmaxrees> the js error has nothing to do with asp.
[14:46:33] <Haystack78> perhaps jsfiddle is showing an error there because it does not have access to the DocsEditor code?
[14:46:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:46:46] <robertmaxrees> because that line is invalid JS.
[14:46:53] <robertmaxrees> you can't mix quotes like that.
[14:47:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that reners out to something valid.
[14:47:04] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[14:47:14] <robertmaxrees> you see my suggestion for the console.log() abve?
[14:47:16] <robertmaxrees> *above
[14:49:10] <Haystack78> yes, thanks.  where would that print out to?
[14:49:29] <Haystack78> chrome's inspector window, or some file somehwere?
[14:49:45] <robertmaxrees> chrome's js console
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> or ff or edge or ie :)
[14:53:51] <Haystack78> https://pastebin.com/BaT71MkX
[14:54:40] <robertmaxrees> what about console.log(dropzoneForm.submit) ?
[14:56:10] <Haystack78> yeah thats undefined
[14:57:16] <Haystack78> I keep thinking there is an if somewhere that is looking to make sure a file is attached, and that if I find that I can just change it
[14:58:56] <Haystack78> obviously I came here because I don't really know what I am doing, lol.
[14:59:42] <Haystack78> so you think the problemd is that dropzoneForm.submit is undefined?
[14:59:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:00:12] <Haystack78> any clues what I could do about that?
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno without seeing valid code.
[15:00:43] <Haystack78> lol, I would send you the entire source if I hadn't signed an nda
[15:00:58] <Haystack78> I'm giving you the actual code tho, 100%
[15:03:40] <robertmaxrees> that's not the code that's getting rendered to the browser (shrug)
[15:04:01] <Haystack78> I don't understand what you mean
[15:04:17] <robertmaxrees> that code is invalid and won't run at all.
[15:04:46] <robertmaxrees> it looks like some kind of templating is involved.
[15:05:00] <Haystack78> I wish I knew ebough to explain to you how it's working, but this code does run fine when a document is dragged onto the page
[15:05:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:05:34] <robertmaxrees> because it's getting rendered into the page
[15:05:34] <Haystack78> the whole project is a mess, its been passed around like sorority girl in a frat house
[15:05:40] <robertmaxrees> the source is not what's making it to the page.
[15:05:47] <robertmaxrees> :|
[15:05:48] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[15:05:49] <robertmaxrees> so yeah
[15:05:59] <Haystack78> how is that even possible?
[15:06:15] <robertmaxrees> it's probably getting passed througha  templating engine.
[15:06:21] <robertmaxrees> i that out of a .js file or a .asp file?
[15:06:29] <Haystack78> I can copy paste the code as it shows up in the chrome debugger
[15:06:42] <Haystack78> .cshtml
[15:06:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that code will be different then waht's on the server heh
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> *what
[15:09:26] <Haystack78> here's the entire script section to that page as copied from the chrome debugger: https://jsfiddle.net/s0hnfmj4/
[15:09:54] <robertmaxrees> notice how it's different?
[15:10:04] <robertmaxrees> now it's url: "/Order/DocsEditor",
[15:10:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:10:15] <Haystack78> yeah I do see that now
[15:10:17] <Haystack78> thank you
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> so dropzoneForm is some kind of plugin?
[15:11:07] <Haystack78> I thought it was an object
[15:11:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:11:28] <Haystack78> told you I'm a noob, lol
[15:11:30] <robertmaxrees> in js everything is an object.
[15:11:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:13:00] <Haystack78> dropzoneForm is the id of the form in the html
[15:13:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:13:34] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' likely what youi think it is.
[15:14:05] <Haystack78> sorry?
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> var dropzoneForm = this;
[15:14:40] <Haystack78> yes?
[15:14:46] <robertmaxrees> then you try dropzoneForm.submit()
[15:16:14] <robertmaxrees> so dropzoneForm isn't what you think it is.
[15:16:15] <robertmaxrees> likely.
[15:21:16] <Haystack78> so I found out Dropzone (capital D) is a class, from the "Javascript Content Files" : https://pastebin.com/0v9rHWPV
[15:38:15] <robertmaxrees> Haystack78 https://www.dropzonejs.com/#create-dropzones-programmatically
[15:39:08] <robertmaxrees> also: https://www.dropzonejs.com/#dropzone-methods
[15:39:15] <robertmaxrees> there's no .submit()
[15:39:16] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:40:05] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:46:35] <robertmaxrees> back
[15:47:57] <Haystack78> hey thanks
[15:49:55] <Haystack78> the thing is, dropzone shouldn't actually be involved because the problem is when someone changes some info in the form and doesn't drag the file over again, so, I guess dropzone isn't used at all?
[15:50:30] <Haystack78> Maybe that's the problem?  Dropzone crashes out because no file is present?
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> you're misunderstanding the error.
[15:52:14] <robertmaxrees> the error is that submit is undefined in dropzoneForm.submit();
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> right?
[15:52:21] <Haystack78> yes
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> and dropzoneForm may very well be the dropzone instance, right?
[15:53:32] <Haystack78> yes
[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> knowing that, go back to what you just said :)
[15:54:16] <Haystack78> the dropzone instance deson;t get created because Dropzone doesn't execute fully?
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> again
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:54:53] <robertmaxrees> phrased differently, you're doing dropzoneForm.submit(), but there's no submit method available for dropzoneForm
[15:55:05] <Haystack78> ahhh, I see
[16:10:20] <robertmaxrees> let's see if things are any better.
[16:14:44] <Haystack78> I tired taking out the submit line, also tried replacing it with processQueue() which is a Dropzone method.  pages still freezes after save is clicked.
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> are you getting the error?
[16:15:25] <robertmaxrees> (the freezing is new info >.>)
[16:15:53] <Haystack78> no, no error this time when the submit is removed or processqueue added.  The page froze before, too, but also kicked out an error
[16:16:23] <robertmaxrees> which handler is being used for that?
[16:17:18] <Haystack78> for what?
[16:19:19] <Haystack78> Sorry, I'm not sure what exactly what are refering to
[16:19:51] <Haystack78> the handler for the uplaods? the handler for redirecting the page after the submit, the handler for something else?
[16:23:14] <Haystack78> I think since no file is uploaded I shouldn't even be dealing with dropzone.  I should just do something like, if filesize == 0, just send over the info from the form, ignore dropzone altogether.  Right?
[16:23:54] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[16:23:59] <Haystack78> I think that's why they used submit in that if, and nowhere else
[16:24:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to figure out *what* is locking up.
[16:24:32] <Haystack78> yeah, not getting a lot of help from Chrome on that behalf
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:24:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd start commenting stuff out.
[16:26:00] <robertmaxrees> or find what runs when the form is submitted/the submit button is clicked
[16:27:31] <Haystack78> well, i think that goes into the Controller, but I put a break point on the first line of that class and the code never got to that point apparently
[16:27:56] <robertmaxrees> you mean server-side?
[16:28:07] <robertmaxrees> because server-side code won't make the browser lock
[16:28:11] <Haystack78> yes the controller is server side
[16:28:23] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:28:24] <Haystack78> I'm saying it never gets to that
[16:28:27] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> because the browser is locking before it sends the network request.
[16:28:38] <Haystack78> the JS makes it lock, and then the Contorller code doesn't execute
[16:28:41] <Haystack78> yes
[16:28:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:28:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:29:41] <robertmaxrees> the server-side code can't cause the browser to lock in the first place
[16:29:47] <robertmaxrees> so there's no point in looking at that side.
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> you care about what's bound to that form submit/button click
[16:31:02] <Haystack78> they're doing some kind of trick where they use a submit type in the html, but then they use preventDefault(); in the js, so the submit doesn't actually execute.  I think thats why they used dropzoneForm.submit
[16:31:17] <Haystack78> does that make sense?
[16:31:18] <robertmaxrees> who is "thgey"?
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> *they
[16:31:28] <Haystack78> the people who coded this
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.,
[16:31:43] <robertmaxrees> so back way up
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> did you add something and this broke?
[16:31:56] <robertmaxrees> or what?  because i'm real confused lol
[16:32:06] <Haystack78> no, it was already broke and I was sent to fix it
[16:32:18] <robertmaxrees> so what broke it?
[16:32:30] <Haystack78> bad code?
[16:32:31] <Haystack78> lol
[16:32:43] <Haystack78> its been broke since before I showed up
[16:32:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:33:06] <robertmaxrees> did it ever work?
[16:33:08] <Haystack78> they have been getting around it by just re-dragging the same doc back over everytime
[16:33:40] <robertmaxrees> so did it ever work orrrrr....?
[16:33:41] <Haystack78> they meaning end users here
[16:33:50] <Haystack78> I would assume it never worked, no
[16:33:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:34:36] <robertmaxrees> so it locks when there's no document present?
[16:35:07] <Haystack78> I mean I can still press the browsers back button, but yeah it just sits there and nothing happens
[16:35:23] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't lock.
[16:35:31] <robertmaxrees> does the browser just not do anything?
[16:35:35] <Haystack78> sorry, i dont know the proper term
[16:35:46] <Haystack78> yeah, its just like the button was never pressed at all
[16:35:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:35:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:36:12] <robertmaxrees> "lock" and "freeze" imply that the page is completely unresponsive
[16:36:19] <robertmaxrees> which is different from "the button doesn't work"
[16:36:44] <Haystack78> ok, my bad
[16:36:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:37:12] <robertmaxrees> so you want to be able to submit the form without attaching a docuiment
[16:38:18] <Haystack78> well, only if a document was attached in the past, so there is a record of it.
[16:38:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:38:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:38:36] <Haystack78> sorry, lol
[16:38:47] <robertmaxrees> okay - let's start over: describe what you want to have happen vs what is happening right now
[16:39:21] <Haystack78> they add a document ( a file, picture, whatever) to an order.  Also on that page are fields to be filled out with data, dates and etc.  that all works fine...
[16:39:39] <Haystack78> its when the come back into that order and try to edit those dates and stuff that the problem occurs
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> ooookay.
[16:40:13] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is with your edit view.
[16:40:19] <Haystack78> okay, so the problem is we have to check to see if a document was ever uploaded, or if it is right now with this form submission
[16:40:25] <Haystack78> yes
[16:41:04] <robertmaxrees> does the subit button have a class or something on it?
[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> maybe btnAddDoc ?
[16:42:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah ok.
[16:42:28] <Haystack78> https://pastebin.com/jNJKp4Fb
[16:42:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, btnAddDoc
[16:43:13] <robertmaxrees> okay so the entire problem is dropzoneForm.submit(); doesn't do what you think it does.
[16:43:31] <robertmaxrees> are you still trying to validate that form?
[16:43:50] <robertmaxrees> when you edit the entry i mean
[16:44:45] <Haystack78> well, the if clause that executes when no image is dragged over does not validate the form.  I don;t know why that is, tho.  There may be some kind of weird logic to it
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> because the validation logic is commented out
[16:45:37] <Haystack78> It also doesn't do a redirect there either.
[16:45:39] <Haystack78> yes
[16:46:04] <Haystack78> I assume there was a reason for that, but I uncommented it and tried it anyway, same result
[16:46:06] <robertmaxrees> right, it's not submitting the form because dropzoneForm.submit(); doesn't do anything,.
[16:46:18] <Haystack78> I think that must be it
[16:46:20] <robertmaxrees> everything comes back to dropzoneForm.submit(); being the problem
[16:47:20] <Haystack78> I think I just need to re-write what happens in that if clause
[16:47:55] <Haystack78> but how do I actually submit that stuff to the controller without a submit?
[16:48:10] <robertmaxrees> you use submit.
[16:48:13] <robertmaxrees> but you target the right thing.
[16:48:30] <robertmaxrees> though there's a catch-22 here that'll break everything :)
[16:49:14] <Haystack78> what do I target?  Something in the model?
[16:49:29] <robertmaxrees> you mean server-side?
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> or....?
[16:50:31] <Haystack78> no, the object that hass all the data client side.  IT's never referenced in the JS.  Not really sure how they are doing that
[16:50:41] <robertmaxrees> what object?
[16:50:47] <Haystack78> yes, what object
[16:50:50] <Haystack78> lol
[16:50:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:50:58] <robertmaxrees> you're being really vague....
[16:51:01] <Haystack78> sorry
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> what model are you talking about?
[16:51:35] <Haystack78> all the data has to be packed into an array, which gets put into JSON, and sent to the server
[16:52:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:52:06] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't require a model.
[16:52:15] <robertmaxrees> is this done with ajax?
[16:52:25] <robertmaxrees> or a normal form submit?
[16:52:40] <Haystack78> I'm not sure
[16:52:52] <robertmaxrees> does the page reload when you submit the form?
[16:52:58] <Haystack78> no
[16:53:02] <robertmaxrees> or go to another page?  anything like that.
[16:53:16] <Haystack78> no
[16:53:20] <bleepy9> <+SP9002_@efnet> so, he wants the win. so we're just gonna get lunch or something, then hes gonna push me to the ground and tap my ass with his foot so he can claim he "kicked my ass" tbh im going along with it becase I dont wanna lose any teeth
[16:53:20] <bleepy9> With our IRC ad service you can reach a global audience of entrepreneurs and fentanyl addicts with extraordinary engagement rates! https://williampitcock.com/
[16:53:28] <Haystack78> well, only if a doc is dragged to the page, then it reloads
[16:54:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:54:16] <robertmaxrees> when it works correctly you mean?
[16:54:20] <Haystack78> right
[16:54:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:54:31] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm asking about
[16:54:38] <robertmaxrees> so it's a normal form submit.
[16:54:49] <Haystack78> ok
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> there's no special "model" - that's hoiw the browser works./
[16:54:56] <robertmaxrees> *how
[16:55:36] <Haystack78> I mean a model in the MVC sense
[16:55:52] <Haystack78> @Model.somevar
[16:58:00] <Haystack78> @model.somevar = $("#ds_shiprName").val();
[16:59:56] <Haystack78> I guess thats more of an MVC question than a jQuery one
[17:01:53] <robertmaxrees> you mean server-side?>
[17:02:15] <Haystack78> yes
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> just to make sure I ask - you realize that the JS and the MVC.NET stuff run in two completely different places, right?
[17:02:36] <robertmaxrees> like, they're fully isolated.
[17:02:47] <Haystack78> yes
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> okay cool.
[17:02:58] <Haystack78> I'm still wrapping my head around MVC
[17:03:01] <robertmaxrees> your model is parsing the form submit body.
[17:03:15] <robertmaxrees> but you're not even there yet since the form isn't submitting in the first place.
[17:03:35] <SkIzZaTo16> <+SP9002_@efnet> so, he wants the win. so we're just gonna get lunch or something, then hes gonna push me to the ground and tap my ass with his foot so he can claim he "kicked my ass" tbh im going along with it becase I dont wanna lose any teeth
[17:03:35] <SkIzZaTo16> With our IRC ad service you can reach a global audience of entrepreneurs and fentanyl addicts with extraordinary engagement rates! https://williampitcock.com/
[17:03:37] <SkIzZaTo16> I thought you guys might be interested in this blog by freenode staff member Bryan 'kloeri' Ostergaard https://bryanostergaard.com/
[17:04:19] <Haystack78> right, so you said I have to target the right thing, but that wont work anyway, catch 22
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:04:44] <robertmaxrees> the catch 22 is that you're still cancelling the submit.
[17:04:49] <robertmaxrees> but you still need to target the element.
[17:05:25] <Haystack78> you're talking about preventDefault(); ?
[17:05:26] <robertmaxrees> basically the block where you're doing taht dropzoneForm.submit(); needs to be completely rewritten.
[17:05:31] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:06:15] <Haystack78> yeah, I really don't understand whats going on with the cancel submit but use asp to detect a POST thinhg
[17:06:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:06:49] <robertmaxrees> asp isn't detecting anything.
[17:07:29] <robertmaxrees> the submit just happens normally.
[17:07:39] <Haystack78> I just know that [HttpPost] is put before the action that handles the data in the controller
[17:08:03] <robertmaxrees> right, and the only way that's hit is if the browser actually submits something.
[17:08:28] <Haystack78> but we canceled to submit with preventDefault
[17:08:38] <Haystack78> *the submit
[17:08:47] <robertmaxrees> what does dropzoneForm.processQueue(); do?
[17:09:31] <Haystack78> not sure.  I believe it handles the numbering of documents attahced to the order.  I did try that inside that if clause, and had the same result
[17:09:51] <robertmaxrees> did you try reading the documentation for dropzone?
[17:09:55] <robertmaxrees> because it explains wit
[17:09:57] <robertmaxrees> *it
[17:10:02] <robertmaxrees> https://www.dropzonejs.com/#enqueuing-file-uploads
[17:10:08] <Haystack78> not all of it.  I read the methods
[17:10:42] <robertmaxrees> it looks like there's some ajax going on here, btw.
[17:10:46] <robertmaxrees> dropzoneForm.on("success", function(uploadedFile, result) {
[17:12:24] <Haystack78> ok
[17:13:09] <robertmaxrees> so it's not a normnal form submit.
[17:13:28] <Haystack78> I guess its the redirect that makes it reload the page
[17:14:06] <Haystack78> window.location.href = redirect;
[17:14:11] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> so something is submiotting the form via ajax
[17:14:26] <robertmaxrees> *submitting
[17:14:57] <Haystack78> how do I find that?
[17:15:56] <robertmaxrees> you said youi're using chrome?
[17:16:01] <Haystack78> yep
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> know how to inspect elements?
[17:16:51] <Haystack78> yes
[17:17:21] <robertmaxrees> inspect the form, then look at the tabs on the right-hand side of the dev tools.
[17:17:30] <robertmaxrees> one tab should say "event listeners"
[17:17:48] <robertmaxrees> next to styles, computed, etc.
[17:18:02] <Haystack78> got it. submitted?
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> *submit
[17:18:14] <Haystack78> right
[17:18:45] <Haystack78> is there a quick key to make that inspector window go full screen, btw?
[17:19:06] <Haystack78> I see you can drag to make it bigger, but I don't see a maximize button
[17:19:39] <Haystack78> don't look it up or anything, if you dont know if the top of your head, no biggie
[17:20:03] <Haystack78> it's pointing to an ajax.js file
[17:20:51] <Haystack78> this part: https://pastebin.com/ynJYXS0b
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> you mean the dev tools window?
[17:22:20] <robertmaxrees> either way, there you go.
[17:23:01] <Haystack78> thank you
[17:24:20] <robertmaxrees> have you looked at your network tab to see if the ajax call is happening when an image isn't attached?
[17:26:06] <Haystack78> wow, that's a cool tool.
[17:26:21] <Haystack78> no, no network activity when no image attached
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:26:42] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah, $5 says if you fix that submit call, you'll be g2g
[17:28:30] <Haystack78> dude, I'll give you $5 if you want it
[17:28:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:28:35] <robertmaxrees> nah
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> free support channel ;)
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> keeps things easy./
[17:30:07] <Haystack78> there is an on click method before the submit one.  You think that has anything to do with anything?  Also, this is all coming from a jQuery.unobtrusive-ajax.js file
[17:30:42] <Haystack78> I really shouldnt edit that file, right?
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> that isn't where your problem lies anywayu.
[17:30:58] <robertmaxrees> it's your code that's busted.
[17:31:29] <Haystack78> back in that if clause in the JS
[17:31:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:31:59] <robertmaxrees> need to call .submit() on the right thing.
[17:38:44] <Haystack78> why is there no submit in the code that executes if there IS an image attached?
[17:39:35] <robertmaxrees> if (dropzoneForm.files.length > 0) { this?
[17:39:46] <Haystack78> yes
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> i've got nothing.  i'd need to have the page in front of me .
[17:40:44] <robertmaxrees> there's obviously some extra stuff going on.
[17:42:26] <Haystack78> no worries
[17:42:42] <Haystack78> so is it just dropzone instead of dropzoneForm?  <form id="dropzoneForm" class="form-horizontal panel-body dropzone" role="form" method="post" action="~/Order/DocsEditor">
[17:43:21] <Haystack78> dropzone.submit()
[17:43:23] <Haystack78> ?
[17:44:55] <Haystack78> nope, not that
[17:44:58] <Haystack78> lol
[17:46:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to select the form itself...
[17:46:31] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with how to select elements with jquery?
[17:48:38] <Haystack78> $("dropzone").submit();   ?
[17:49:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:49:15] <robertmaxrees> that would get you <dropzone>, which isn't a thing :)
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to select the ID - #dropzoneForm is one way.
[17:50:46] <Haystack78> I thought I could use the "dropzone" from the class.  Isn't there some way you can get an element by it's class?
[17:51:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:51:22] <robertmaxrees> .className
[17:55:11] <Haystack78> ok. Gotta double check the DB, but it looks like it's working!  Thanks so much my friend!!!!
[17:55:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[17:55:52] <Haystack78> Man, all that, plus all day yesterday, just to change one line.
[17:56:18] <Haystack78> coding is crazy
[17:56:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:50:34] <omenius> heya, howcome $('.class').position() works but $('.class')[0] is no-no
[19:50:39] <omenius> like I have multiple items on my class
[19:51:01] <omenius> I mean $('.class')[0].position()
[19:51:10] <omenius> that ding just goes red
[19:51:18] <omenius> like all hell breaks lose
[19:51:22] <robertmaxrees> because [0] is getting you a raw dom node.
[19:51:24] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery object.
[19:51:33] <omenius> can I turn it to jquery object?
[19:51:47] <robertmaxrees> use .eq(0) instead
[19:51:50] <robertmaxrees> and you're fine/
[19:52:01] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask why you're trying to access by index
[19:52:18] <omenius> because I need all them positions, I used for
[19:52:26] <omenius> for(...)
[19:52:30] <robertmaxrees> don't use for heh
[19:52:31] <robertmaxrees> use .each()
[19:52:47] <robertmaxrees> $('.foo').each(function() { $(this).position() });
[19:52:47] <omenius> that is jquery function? Nice
[19:52:55] <omenius> thanks
[19:53:08] <robertmaxrees> though fyi most jquery methods do an implicit each
[19:54:15] <omenius> works like charm, I need to adopt that each function, it's such space-saver anyway
[19:54:30] <robertmaxrees> most of the time you don't need it (shrug)
[19:55:22] <omenius> I think I have iterated trough jquery array with for at least couple times in my code
[19:55:36] <robertmaxrees> it's not really an array fwiw.
[19:55:50] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing inside the callback of the each?
[19:56:45] <omenius> I don't remember what I have used to use for, but now I'm just needing some positions
[19:57:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to just get positions?
[19:57:30] <omenius> yeah, the code you gave did everything I needed that for :)
[19:57:44] <robertmaxrees> (i'm tring to understand your use case because there might be better/easier ways to do what you want"
[19:59:01] <omenius> I'm pretty much hacking, scraping information, so this does just fine :)
[19:59:11] <robertmaxrees> -_-
[19:59:39] <omenius> not like doing anything illegal :P
[19:59:54] <robertmaxrees> i mean, scraping technically is but (shrug)
[20:00:00] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaanyway
[20:00:42] <omenius> it's not like that, I don't go trough pages
[20:00:54] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[20:01:01] <omenius> I try to save poker hands to analyze them later that I play
[20:01:12] <omenius> so no additional server usage or anything
[20:01:41] <omenius> the site even offers hand histories but I hate the ui
[20:02:04] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  moving on :)
[20:06:19] <omenius> this actually makes me like ask how the inertnet law (:D) sees scraping, lilke where are the lines for ok and not-ok. I've at least sometimes had alerts that go trough site once a minute for example, is that okay?
[20:06:26] <omenius> *internet law
[20:07:11] <robertmaxrees> it's up to the site in general.
[20:07:15] <robertmaxrees> check their TOS
[20:07:15] <omenius> does it only depend on laws that affect the client?
[20:07:29] <omenius> right
[20:08:09] <robertmaxrees> you check the TOS and that's what tells you what's fine.
[20:10:00] <robertmaxrees> if it doesn't say, then assume it's not OK.
[20:19:08] <adity> Hello, I am looking to do mulitple selections from a list in jquery but the duplicate values are treated as a single value. Is there any way to set duplicates properly?
[20:19:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:19:35] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're trying to do.
[20:22:35] <adity> https://www.grocerycrud.com/demo/film_management/add, in this link, please look at the actors input list. When I select an actor name, that gets added to the actors list, I modified the code to allow for duplicate selection of actors and the duplicates show up in the selected list. When the form is submitted and when I check the list of selected items, the duplicates are treated as a singular value.
[20:22:44] <robertmaxrees> err
[20:22:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:23:00] <adity> I am sorry, I am a noob here :)
[20:23:18] <robertmaxrees> can you show JUST the relevant code?
[20:23:29] <adity> ok let me try
[20:23:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ would be best :)
[20:27:43] <robertmaxrees> adity any luck?
[20:30:26] <robertmaxrees> :\
[20:30:32] <adity> I am trying but since the code is contained in an external library, it will take some time for me to set it up in fiddle. I am completely new to jquery so please bear with me :). On debugging the code I see that the DOM list containing the nodes for the selections only have single value for duplicates. Is this known behaviour and if so, is there a way to get around it
[20:30:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:30:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry wait - did you modify the library??
[20:31:11] <robertmaxrees> and could you clarify what you mean by "duplicates"??
[20:31:52] <adity> the libraries that I am using in the project is ui-multiselect that uses jquey to set up things.
[20:31:54] <robertmaxrees> i can only add one actor at a time on https://www.grocerycrud.com/demo/film_management/add so something isn't making sense.
[20:32:45] <adity> the link is the external library that I am using which codes the multiselect functionality
[20:32:59] <robertmaxrees> so what do you mean by "duplicate"?
[20:33:15] <robertmaxrees> oh this link doesn't show the bug?
[20:33:22] <adity> Yes, it does not
[20:33:23] <adity> sorry :)
[20:33:52] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, I'd need to see the relevant code.  you didn't modify the library, right
[20:33:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:34:50] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:34:52] <adity> Currently, on choosing akroyd christian, it dissapears from available list and gets added to selected list. I modified it so that it gets added to selected but does not disappear from the available list. By this, I can add the same actor multiple times in the actors list (I can add akroyd christian twice as selected)
[20:35:05] <adity> This works fine
[20:35:06] <robertmaxrees> you didn'
[20:35:10] <adity> not in this code
[20:35:16] <robertmaxrees> in any code???
[20:35:22] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i'm very confused right now.
[20:35:26] <adity> lol sorry
[20:35:36] <adity> I said it will take some time to set it up in fiddle
[20:35:55] <robertmaxrees> yopu can't just paste the relevant bits?
[20:35:59] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if it doesn't work.
[20:36:05] <adity> oh
[20:36:08] <robertmaxrees> just seeing the code might be enough
[20:36:15] <adity> then wait
[20:38:45] <adity> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=gjgLdKgoTv
[20:39:14] <robertmaxrees> :|
[20:39:43] <adity> it is part of the library that I am using, does this make any sense?
[20:39:58] <robertmaxrees> and you modified this libraryu?
[20:40:01] <robertmaxrees> *library
[20:40:35] <adity> yes if I delete lines 6 and 33
[20:40:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:40:56] <robertmaxrees> so
[20:41:04] <robertmaxrees> don't modify libraries.
[20:41:15] <adity> but I does not work if I dont :)
[20:41:25] <robertmaxrees> then you find another way to get what you want./
[20:41:33] <robertmaxrees> and it still doesn'
[20:41:35] <adity> any suggestions :)
[20:41:38] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't do what you want./
[20:41:59] <robertmaxrees> you basically want a way to select things in one list and copy them to another?
[20:42:05] <robertmaxrees> and allow for duplicates?
[20:42:17] <adity> not really, i just want to select the same item multiple times
[20:42:19] <adity> from the list
[20:42:44] <robertmaxrees> "select multiple times" doesn't really make sense.
[20:42:51] <robertmaxrees> do you mean add it multiple times?
[20:42:54] <adity> so on the right if I have a list of possible items to be selected, I want to select item number 1 twice in my list
[20:43:20] <adity> so I want to add to the selected option, the name of the same actor twice
[20:43:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:43:37] <robertmaxrees> so the plugin you've chosen is not a good tool for this job.
[20:43:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:43:41] <adity> haha
[20:43:45] <adity> I see
[20:43:52] <adity> so there is no way to modify the plugin?
[20:43:54] <robertmaxrees> modifying libraries is a bad idea in general.
[20:44:04] <robertmaxrees> you *can*, but then stuff breaks.
[20:44:06] <adity> is it the plugin or is it a standard behavious in jquery lists
[20:44:19] <adity> behaviour*
[20:44:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean jquery ui?
[20:44:26] <adity> yea :)
[20:44:27] <adity> sorry
[20:44:43] <robertmaxrees> and do you eman sortable?
[20:44:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists like this

[22:07:52] <yellowKey> Question, if I have a div that contains the overflow, and assuming scroll, do I need to attach the event handler for on scroll to said div?
[22:08:33] <yellowKey> I tried window.addEventListener, but that deosn't seem to return anything, so I figured it's being affected because the body or html isn't overflow, the div is.
