[08:07:16] <Munger> Hi. Forgive my ignorance, but does anyone have a simple example of defining an on click handler within a custom namespace?
[08:35:59] <Munger> Actually, scrap that last question. I have another...
[08:38:24] <Munger> I have some code that manages a table dynamically via ajax. Is there a way to automatically bind that code to a dom element purely by adding a CSS class to that element?
[22:38:51] <Rockwood> what is the best way for display error in jquery on json data?
[23:26:22] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood what do you mean?
[23:56:43] <Rockwood> robertmaxrees, thanks issue solved
