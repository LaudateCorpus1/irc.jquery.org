[00:06:43] <pokmo> hi
[00:07:18] <pokmo> i'm trying to make an $('img')[0].height return non zero even when the image isn't loaded
[00:07:30] <pokmo> on safari, it works fine if i just set style.height to nonzero
[00:07:44] <pokmo> but on chrome, it returns 0 no regardless of the style.height value
[00:07:48] <pokmo> anyone know how to make it return non zero?
[07:17:16] <dawKo> Is there a good way to catch an event, modify it, and re-trigger it? Specifically I'm handling the first Bootstrap `shown.bs.tab` for each tab, and would like to trigger a custom `shown.bs.tab.first` event, which retains all the properties of the original event.

[18:35:25] <madprops> hi
[18:35:36] <madprops> is it necesary to do an .eq(0) after using find with an # id ?
[22:57:10] <Neo4> if you are full stack developer for you enough overview and know viable  basics for read and break down code... :)
[23:31:23] <Robdgreat> sounds like you've already made your decision
[23:54:29] <Neo4> I was needed read some pieces  of code in angular nothing difficult. Not difficult. and that code uses jquery, angularjs, javascript from bootstrap. I think all of this don't need, you can use your own css instead bootstrap
[23:55:20] <Neo4> for companies or developer teams it's good to use libs, because we will do equal code.
[23:56:05] <Neo4> I think it's all make for standardize code
[23:56:29] <Neo4> exists many css libs, what will use chose?
[23:56:42] <Neo4> Doesn't matter, unless you are company
[23:57:01] <Neo4> much better to create your own set of styles and use :)
[23:57:24] <Robdgreat> my point is since you've already made your decision, why are you bothering to ask?
[23:57:49] <Neo4> Robdgreat: I not sure that I'm right...
[23:57:57] <Neo4> Robdgreat: I need to know your mind :)
[23:58:11] <Neo4> Robdgreat: this is my decigion and what is yours?
[23:59:05] <Robdgreat> I use frameworks because I find them useful. I've never used angular but I know enough people who use it and like it that I'd be willing to give it a try
[23:59:27] <Neo4> Robdgreat: and you are front end developer?
[23:59:40] <Robdgreat> by the same token one could ask why you're using jquery instead of just using plain javascript
[23:59:41] <Neo4> you do only javascript and nothing else yes?
[23:59:46] <Robdgreat> what?
[23:59:52] <Robdgreat> when did I say that?
