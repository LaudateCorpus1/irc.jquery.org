[00:15:01] <Mark_____> is there a way i can execute jquery function when the previous function is done loading?
[00:34:08] <b1101> anyone awake? trying to do a $.post("data.php",$("#chartsDropdownMenu input").serialize()).done(function(data){$("#mydiv").load("some.html"); in the summons.html is the call to the data.php file which requires the posted data. but it is out of sync, as the $_POST data is no longer functional by the time of the load of some.html
[00:34:44] <b1101> in the some.html*
[00:50:37] <b1101> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/86472e1d525efe9481ae
[02:10:07] <noregret> how can i add an <options> to a <select>? $("#id_nationality").append("<option>").prop('value', 1).html('text'); - this failed
[02:25:53] <nail_> noregret: .append() does not return what has been appended but what it was called on
[02:27:10] <b1101> nail_: any chance you can suggest something for https://gist.github.com/anonymous/86472e1d525efe9481ae
[02:28:59] <noregret> nail_: don't get it, how can I add an <option> now ?
[02:31:14] <worknick> hi
[02:31:51] <Kartagis> good morning all
[02:31:55] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xm39m9vq/ <--- I'd like a small piece of help
[02:31:56] <worknick> i have to initialize my star rating jq plugin by doing   $('.rating').rating({}). how can i make it initialize dynamically?
[02:34:43] <arc_> noregret just assign the option to a variable and then append the variable
[02:34:50] <arc_> it doesn't all have to be done on one line
[02:35:59] <noregret> arc_: like so? var v = $("<option>").prop("value", 1).html('text') ?
[02:36:22] <arc_> sure
[02:36:41] <arc_> if you really want to do it all on one line, you can also insert the right side of that expression inside the append
[02:43:31] <arc_> Kartagis you are selecting all of those images simultaneously
[02:43:34] <arc_> so what is your $(this)
[02:43:40] <arc_> in the on click, it's what you clicked on
[02:45:10] <Kartagis> arc_: so, what do I need to do?
[02:45:25] <arc_> you need to iterate over those images
[02:45:58] <arc_> also the 'animal' class is unique to these images, so you don't need to select '.animal img' you can just select '.animal'
[02:46:12] <arc_> oh, nevermind. those are the divs
[02:46:27] <slax0r> .animal img and .animal is quite a different selector...
[02:47:09] <arc_> i thought he just got it wrong, but i misread the html
[02:53:10] <Kartagis> I never get it wrong (except the times I do)
[03:11:40] <hellyeah> pls some help
[03:12:34] <hellyeah> CreateNewInstance function worked correctly when you click "create" button but i cannot see DateTimeInput on screen what is the reason of that?

[03:18:50] <worknick> ok
[03:33:24] <hellyeah> hey no one around?
[03:33:46] <hellyeah> pls someone respond
[03:36:14] <noregret> im'  using the datepicker from jquery-ui, and I also have bootstrap's css loaded, and they are interferring with each other, as the datepicker isn't styled correctly, what can i do here
[03:38:53] <hellyeah> bootstrap has datepicker too
[03:39:00] <hellyeah> it may conflict
[03:40:32] <noregret> oh didn't know about it
[03:41:08] <noregret> hellyeah: can't find it, where is bootstrap's datepicker ?
[03:41:35] <hellyeah> https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
[03:43:15] <noregret> hellyeah: ah, doesn't seem official
[03:44:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:44:56] <hellyeah> i didnt know that
[03:45:15] <hellyeah> noregret: did you try to style datepickers?
[03:45:32] <noregret> hellyeah: nope
[03:45:37] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:45:39] <noregret> hellyeah: gonna use this one, looks nice
[03:45:44] <hellyeah> ic
[03:45:55] <hellyeah> but jquery datepicker ui a lot of thing
[03:45:59] <hellyeah> did you check api
[03:46:33] <hellyeah> https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/not sure bootstrap datepicker has thos functionalities
[03:46:37] <hellyeah> just let you know
[03:47:37] <noregret> hellyeah: yeah, i'm gonna use the bootstrap datepicker
[03:47:44] <hellyeah> okey
[03:47:47] <hellyeah> go for it
[03:48:03] <hellyeah> if you prepare fiddle with it
[03:48:14] <hellyeah> pls share it for the sake of sharing information
[03:48:46] <noregret> hellyeah: but its docs are clear.. I don't get your point
[03:49:12] <hellyeah> hehe i am working with jquery ui datepicker
[03:49:19] <hellyeah> and jqx widget
[03:49:22] <hellyeah> just wondering
[03:49:24] <hellyeah> :D
[03:51:47] <noregret> ah ok
[03:53:40] <Kartagis> arc_: something like https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xm39m9vq/3/ ?
[03:53:52] <hellyeah> noregret: btw this is the another option just letr you know take a look at jqx widget it has useful tools http://jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxdatetimeinput/index.htm
[03:54:14] <hellyeah> brb
[03:58:18] <arc_> Kartagis you can use $(this) inside the function to refer to the current object element that the each is working on
[03:58:39] <arc_> you are very close
[03:59:07] <arc_> i got it working by making two changes
[04:00:24] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xm39m9vq/4/
[04:01:49] <arc_> v.attr isn't going to work. you can use $(v) or $(this)
[04:02:33] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xm39m9vq/5/ 404
[04:02:35] <arc_> secondly, $(this) is referring to the image. you need the id of the div, not the image
[04:03:54] <Kartagis> right, so I need something like parent
[04:04:07] <Kartagis> .closest() ?
[04:04:52] <arc_> that works
[04:05:33] <Kartagis> 404
[04:05:41] <Kartagis> $(v).attr("src", baseUrl + $(this).closest().attr("id") + ".png");
[04:06:41] <arc_> closest() requires a selector. the closest what?
[04:06:47] <Kartagis> need coffee
[04:06:53] <arc_> heh
[04:07:08] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/xm39m9vq/7/
[04:07:11] <Kartagis> yes!
[04:13:03] <arc_> Kartagis the reason v didn't work and $(v) did is because most jquery methods can only be used on jquery objects, and v was not a jquery object in that instance. if you see something like "v.attr is not a function" your first thing to check is whether v is a jquery object
[04:13:22] <Kartagis> k
[04:13:26] <Kartagis> noted
[04:13:36] * Kartagis looks at coffee
[04:19:06] <kristhian> someone up?
[04:19:55] <Kartagis> we're all down
[04:20:26] <hellyeah> hey
[04:21:17] <hellyeah> this question may be spesific to jqx widget i am not sure but i create multiple elements with create button but DateTimeInput feature didnt work when you click calendar button. Can you help me to figure out why? http://jsfiddle.net/zyhfm6oo/10/
[04:24:07] <Mark_____> : does anyone have an idea on this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35354526/mcustomscrollbar-to-replace-the-scrollbar
[04:24:57] <Duikb00t> What can cause that the easy lt selector is not working? $('#all-partners li:lt(3)').show();
[04:25:40] <hellyeah> Duikb00t: fiddle?
[04:25:58] <estodiMania> Hello, what is the difference between $.post and $.ajax? Thank you.
[04:26:50] <hellyeah> estodiMania: did you read tutorials?
[04:26:51] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/e0dLkacn/
[04:27:11] <Duikb00t> I think it's more a 'damn it's friday' issue >< but I can't find it
[04:27:43] <kristhian> i am making a script for an online radio that needs some jquery
[04:28:09] <estodiMania> Yes, i have but it is still not clear for me.
[04:28:22] <kristhian> http://myradio.16mb.com/player.php <- here is the example
[04:28:36] <Duikb00t> estodiMania: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1344303/jquery-ajax-vs-get-post
[04:28:54] <hellyeah> not sure
[04:29:06] <kristhian> my question is i wanted to make avatar change when a current dj/user got online
[04:29:09] <hellyeah> but i will say ajax is for passing argument to function in backend
[04:29:19] <kristhian> can someone help me out?
[04:29:34] <hellyeah> whereas post load something from backend
[04:29:39] <arc_> Duikb00t why do you say this isn't working?
[04:29:45] <kristhian> http://pastebin.com/qMNdcpfn <- here is my php script
[04:29:56] <hellyeah> so ajax is for one aim post is for another
[04:30:17] <arc_> Duikb00t change show() to hide() and you will see that it is working
[04:30:41] <arc_> also, when you are selecting by id, it's unnecessary to select element#id, because ids are unique
[04:30:47] <arc_> you can just select #id
[04:31:11] <Kartagis> news flash! this is #jquery
[04:31:40] <arc_> and you should, because it's faster
[04:33:00] <kristhian> Kartagis i wated to add jquery on that script
[04:34:57] <Kartagis> arc_: if I want to click on them individually, do I need iteration for that too?
[04:36:48] <arc_> Kartagis no
[04:37:03] <arc_> if you are within a click event, $(this) refers to the event target
[04:38:30] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/gd63pc88/1/
[04:38:33] <Kartagis> yes!
[04:38:53] <arc_> lol. gj
[04:39:17] <Kartagis> I did this one at the first time
[04:39:52] <Kartagis> I'm making a mobile thing for my daughter
[04:40:26] <Kartagis> the draft I did yesterday, everything was hardcoded
[04:40:41] <Kartagis> 8 animals, 8 event handlers etc
[04:41:18] <arc_> yeah, this is cleaner than that for sure
[04:41:24] <hanshenrik> can i hook the $() function and make it throw new Error()  when it doesn't find any matches?
[04:41:57] <hanshenrik> var element=$("#notExistingID");  << error
[04:55:56] <PCatinean> Hey guys
[04:56:57] <PCatinean> I am trying to make a bootstrap crousel work with some custom buttons and even though I call a function that removes active from a element and adds it to another, when the unction is rolled the second time and the dom is updated it still sees the previous element as being active
[04:57:01] <PCatinean> any idea why that might happen?
[04:59:10] <PCatinean> and I do $('#carousel div.active') every time
[04:59:39] <PCatinean> Looking at $('#carousel') the first element appears with active still
[04:59:48] <PCatinean> Though in the dom it's updated
[05:14:13] <PCatinean> nobody?
[05:18:59] <oaulakh> what wrong with jquery, it's saying $ not defined? i am new to jquery so if iam wrong than please, but i seen tutorials on code academy and according to tuts it's right way
[05:21:24] <Uhkis> oaulakh: are you using noConflict?
[05:21:32] <oaulakh> means?
[05:21:50] <oaulakh> i dunno what noconflit is :(
[05:21:52] <Uhkis> so probably not, can you show the full html?
[05:21:59] <oaulakh> ok
[05:22:56] <oaulakh> its ugly i know but i am doing practice https://dpaste.de/oyxA :)
[05:23:25] <oaulakh> Uhkis, i'm trying to update price
[05:23:36] <Duikb00t> allright so far so good: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/e0dLkacn/1/
[05:23:50] <Duikb00t> Is there an easy way to change the 'more' to 'less' when all content is being shown?
[05:24:13] <Duikb00t> Something like if selector large then XX items then change the text() from the <a> tag
[05:24:22] <Uhkis> oaulakh: you have jquery code before jquery is included, move your jquery <script> line to head
[05:24:50] <oaulakh> Uhkis, i did that was something djnago template stuff but i did but same error
[05:25:52] <oaulakh> Uhkis, yup error removed thanks bro :)
[05:26:42] <oaulakh> Uhkis, i was thinking django will inherit my block in base template at right plate but it didn't so that's why i was facing error
[05:26:46] <oaulakh> thanks
[05:38:48] <oaulakh> https://jsfiddle.net/o4ggug2c/ why this price function not updating ?
[05:40:51] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/e0dLkacn/2/   Why is my text not updating -_-'
[05:41:01] <arc_> oaulakh because the value of price is 250
[05:41:32] <oaulakh> arc_, but i do have in data-price
[05:41:42] <arc_> it looks like you want it to update when the select changes
[05:41:49] <arc_> in which case you need to use a change event handler
[05:41:50] <oaulakh> arc_, yes
[05:42:03] <oaulakh> arc_, how?
[05:42:23] <Duikb00t> Well.. on change
[05:42:43] <Duikb00t> https://api.jquery.com/change/
[05:42:46] <Duikb00t> oaulakh:
[05:42:47] <arc_> Duikb00t because the line setting the value of items is only being run one time
[05:43:16] <Duikb00t> You mean where I count the visibile items
[05:43:24] <Duikb00t> Indeed that is the issue. But how to determine it the best way ?
[05:43:39] <Duikb00t> I need to recalculate after every click
[05:43:47] <arc_> move the line into the event handler
[05:44:19] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/e0dLkacn/3/
[05:44:20] <Duikb00t> I tried that already :D
[05:44:26] <Duikb00t> But still no changes ><
[05:44:49] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: under the slidetoggle.
[05:45:17] <Duikb00t> That was a friday mistake stupid me
[05:45:56] <Mark_____> um,
[05:46:16] <Mark_____> what have i done wrong here? the spinner (.loader_container) is not visible https://jsfiddle.net/vxppzmfp/5/
[05:46:43] <Mark_____> i want to have .loader_container visible only when the data is being loaded.
[05:46:48] <Mark_____> can anyone help me out?
[05:47:26] <Duikb00t> jQuery is not defined .. Mark_____ Update your Fiddle
[05:47:41] <Mark_____> no, it’s only the script. not the entire thing
[05:47:48] <Mark_____> i can’t really replicate the same problem here
[05:47:51] <Mark_____> but, i have a live site
[05:47:55] <Mark_____> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[05:48:42] <Mark_____> if you click on the ‘공지사항’ on the bottom of the page, and click on any of the images you can find
[05:49:05] <Mark_____> you see how the spinner is not visible, that’s cause i used both show and hide at the same time.
[05:49:19] <Mark_____> i don’t know exactly what i did wrong in the code though
[05:50:01] <Duikb00t> Amost there: unreal Uhkis https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/e0dLkacn/4/
[05:50:27] <arc_> you should really not be using onclick html attribute
[05:50:36] <Mark_____> arc_: me?
[05:50:38] <arc_> yes
[05:50:52] <Mark_____> where am i using html onclick?
[05:50:55] <arc_> that's just general advice, it probably doesn't have anything to do with this problem
[05:51:04] <Mark_____> oh yeah,
[05:51:08] <arc_> the link you said to click on
[05:51:15] <Mark_____> but there’s a good reason for me to usehtat
[05:51:17] <Mark_____> use *that
[05:51:24] <arc_> ok
[05:52:27] <arc_> if you use ajax to load this content instead of just replacing the src then you can hide the spinner inside the callback of the ajax function
[05:52:36] <arc_> which fires after ajax is done loading data
[05:52:38] <Mark_____> i know.
[05:52:42] <Mark_____> i’ve done it before,but
[05:52:55] <Mark_____> unfortunately, this CMS that im using is not very friendlywith ajax
[05:53:02] <Mark_____> so i went with iframe.
[05:53:38] <arc_> well, afaik there is no other way to make it do something after this stuff is done loading. you can make it wait a specific amount of time, which you already know
[05:53:57] <arc_> doing it the way you're doing it, it will just be hidden instantly
[05:54:03] <Mark_____> someone told me something about .promise but not sure.
[05:55:53] <arc_> promise can allow you to wait until an animation is finished running before running some code
[05:56:12] <arc_> however that has nothing to do with the loading of this data
[05:59:19] <Duikb00t> Someone an idea about my more/less problem
[06:07:34] <arc_> Duikb00t it's because it's checking whether the items are visible during the animation
[06:07:45] <arc_> they are always visible during the animation
[06:08:10] <arc_> so if you use the promise we just discussed to force it to wait until the animation completes before running your code to check the number of visible elements and change the text, it will work
[06:12:01] <Duikb00t> So so arc_ https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/e0dLkacn/5/
[06:12:11] <Duikb00t> Looks ok for you?
[06:13:07] <arc_> that is not how i would do it. it works, but it's better to use a promise because it will simply fire when the animation is done, instead of relying on a timer
[06:13:51] <arc_> actually hang on a secon
[06:13:51] <arc_> d
[06:14:10] <arc_> ah of course. slidetoggle has its own callback
[06:14:13] <arc_> yes, that's fine
[06:14:31] <arc_> sorry about the confusion
[06:16:05] <arc_> idk why i only help in here when it's 6am :p
[06:16:32] <Duikb00t> Hahaha
[06:16:38] <Duikb00t> thanks a lot Yes i saw just it had a callback
[06:16:43] <Duikb00t> So that's why i've put it there.
[06:16:54] <arc_> yes, that's perfect
[06:17:00] <Duikb00t> allrighty

[08:59:52] <estodiMania> I am using clone to duplicate the last row of a table including the inputs. But i need to clear all the inputs beside  one hidden input. The hidden input needs to get a + 1. So the value of the hidden input is now 12 when i click on the clone button it needs to be 13 and all other  input fields need to be cleared.
[08:59:59] <estodiMania> How can i do it?
[09:00:22] <estodiMania> I have made it so far that the cloned input fields are blank
[09:01:36] <mrk> Calinou: sir http://drupal.magister.ovh/area-de-alumnos
[09:01:47] <mrk> on scroll i get flash the secondary stacked menu
[09:01:54] <mrk> i dont know why
[09:05:41] <mrk> is strange
[09:26:14] <islalobo> Using bootstrap js to create a modal form that is prepopulated with ajax. Looking for cleanest way to create a progress bar (or similar) while the ajax call is being made: http://kopy.io/oQnvo
[09:31:01] <silverdust> If I have var f = $('.foo') with my f variable how can I get '.foo[data-index=x]' ?
[09:31:58] <silverdust> If I was to throw in the entire selector at once that'll be fine but I only have the f variable available at the point when I'm trying to select the ones with a data-index value
[09:47:05] <hellyeah> hey,
[09:48:22] <hellyeah> pls create datepickers and select the date then create new element why i expect to see dates that has class "ui-state-disabled" but gave me something i dont understand pls check line 193 http://jsfiddle.net/xrdk3bop/5/
[09:48:40] <hellyeah> oh
[09:48:49] <hellyeah> the value is in span
[09:50:43] <hellyeah> it gave me something interesting http://jsfiddle.net/xrdk3bop/6/
[09:53:18] <shoky> silverdust: you can use .filter()
[09:53:18] <mrk> please someone can help me.... my secondary menu stack on scroll make flash on scroll... like toggle ..... http://drupal.magister.ovh/area-de-alumnos
[10:01:43] <silverdust> ok thanks shoky
[10:06:51] <silverdust> I have a problem with a cloned item appearing more than once here https://jsfiddle.net/bl4ckdu5t/s9ph9jr3/
[10:09:59] <mrk> please someone can help me.... my secondary menu stack on scroll make flash on scroll... like toggle ..... http://drupal.magister.ovh/area-de-alumnos
[10:10:31] <shoky> silverdust: $('.product-set__pin').clone()   clones ALL .product-set__pin elements that are in the dom
[10:12:26] <shoky> silverdust: so you shouldn't keep re-running that query on each click
[10:17:25] <silverdust> shoky: I changed it to $('.product-set__pin:eq(0)') when I realized
[10:18:04] <shoky> silverdust: uh no, no reason to re-query the dom each time. just do it once. https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/s9ph9jr3/1/
[10:18:16] <hellyeah> pls create datepickers and select the date then create new element why i expect to see dates that has class "ui-state-disabled" but gave me something i dont understand pls check line 193   http://jsfiddle.net/xrdk3bop/6/
[10:23:14] <silverdust> oh wow I see. by putting it outside of the event it only sees the one that was cached before clicks
[10:28:39] <silverdust> shoky: how can I get the nearest adjacent sibling?
[10:28:53] <shoky> hellyeah  line 191 $('td')  selects ALL td's in the document...  line 193 you're getting the text of ALL .ui-state-default elements in the table.  also, i believe jquery-ui reuses the same table for each datepicker so there's only ever one. also the dates only get disabled when the datepicker is actually shown.
[10:29:34] <shoky> hellyeah: so.. don't rely on these ui-state-default or disabled classes that jqui puts. you already know what's disabled since you're the one controlling that in the beforeShowDay or whatever
[10:29:48] <shoky> silverdust: what do you mean by nearest adjacent?
[10:30:32] <shoky> silverdust: probably what you want is to give your containers a class. then do  $(this).closest('.containerclass').find('.whateverIwannaFindInside')
[10:32:15] <silverdust> If I have <div><span></span><em></em><em></em><em></em></div> . Without a class, how can I get the closest em to the span
[10:32:30] <shoky> why without a class?
[10:32:36] <shoky> and you do that with .next()
[10:33:00] <shoky> without a class, you're doing it wrong
[10:36:17] <silverdust> I actually have a class but there are too many similar classes. From the fiddle I showed you where they are all cloned
[10:36:44] <shoky> huh?
[10:36:54] <shoky> too many similar classes..?
[10:37:10] <silverdust> I mean too many classes of the same names
[10:37:25] <shoky> still no idea what you mean
[10:37:46] <shoky> 2 different classes can't have the same name :)
[10:38:27] <shoky> in any case if something is not structured right, then structure it right :)
[10:38:35] <silverdust> From that fiddle when I place a little image within the larger image I position an input right beside it to enter a value that will go in the data-attribute of the last entered tiny image
[10:39:17] <hellyeah> shoky: thansk
[10:39:36] <silverdust> Obviously all those tiny images were cloned in and there's no way I can give them a unique class
[10:39:54] <shoky> who said anything about a unique class
[10:40:01] <shoky> tiny images should share the same class
[10:41:35] <shoky> if something inside that cloned element is clicked,  and e.g. you wanna get the tiny image next to it,  you just do $(this).closest('.product-set__pin').find('.tinyImageClass')
[10:41:37] <silverdust> then if I was to go up the dom and come back to find how do I get the one I need?
[10:41:45] <shoky> .closest and .find
[10:43:30] <shoky> silverdust:  for example  https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/s9ph9jr3/2/
[10:43:51] <shoky> (clicking the X just removes the associated tiny image)
[10:47:03] <silverdust> I'll have to show you what I'm doing for you to understand. Give me a sec
[10:47:14] <silverdust> I'm making a short gif
[10:47:22] <shoky> why not a fiddle?
[10:49:54] <silverdust> Thought it'd be too much. What I gave earlier was a RTC from a bigger picture
[10:50:08] <silverdust> but I'd try
[10:57:54] <silverdust> shoky: It's too much UI work to replicate but here's what's going on https://www.dropbox.com/s/iimw5iq74c5fhi7/adameveshop_products.gif?dl=0
[10:59:10] <silverdust> when I check an option from that pop up I want it to update the nearest plus icon with a data attribute and value
[11:00:40] <silverdust> shoky: seen?
[11:01:33] <shoky> silverdust yea.. what do mean by "nearest" ? nearest to what?
[11:02:10] <silverdust> nearest to the input area where I check an item
[11:02:52] <silverdust> In the dom the last plus created is always right above the input area
[11:03:24] <shoky> silverdust: oh you want it to happen when you check the checkbox?  then yes  .closest and .find
[11:03:32] <shoky> just like in my last example fiddle..
[11:04:21] <shoky> silverdust: or well, i donno how you're implementing that popup,
[11:04:30] <shoky> silverdust: which is why a fiddle would be much better..
[11:05:34] <shoky> silverdust: if there's only one such popup and you just move it around.. then you need to store somewhere (e.g. in a variable) which of the cloned elements is the "current edited one" or whatever
[11:06:31] <silverdust> okay I guess I still have to make the fiddle
[11:07:42] <shoky> you just have to know which one you want to modify..
[11:08:05] <shoky> e.g. the last clicked one
[11:10:27] <game0> hey community, I need some help with my code, I want to create something that will show to user when he press submit answer, like replace input text to correct sign with his answer for each question
[11:10:48] <game0> https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/x2g7v2aL/
[11:11:26] <game0> I tried but it's not working for me
[11:15:36] <shoky> game0: you're listening for submit event on a button. submit event happens on a form. (click event happens on buttons). also you have a line-break on 30 that isn't valid inside a string literal. also you didn't include jquery
[11:16:14] <shoky> game0: on line 30 *
[11:17:46] <silverdust> shoky: here https://jsfiddle.net/bl4ckdu5t/s9ph9jr3/3/ I will like to update the plus icon's data-id attribute with the value selected from the radio button
[11:21:14] <shoky> silverdust: and what's stopping you from doing that?
[11:21:20] <game0> shoky, thanks
[11:24:43] <silverdust> when I click the radio I go up the dom with .closest('.product-set__products') and try to find its nearest .product-set__pin
[11:25:08] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:25:21] <silverdust> so .next('.product-set__pin')
[11:26:15] <shoky> silverdust: it would be .prev() in your case.. but you don't need to traverse the dom if you just store the currently edited pin in a variable like i suggested
[11:27:47] <silverdust> I don't get how you mean I should store it in a variable. I'd appreciate if you could show me
[11:29:06] <silverdust> you mean to store the value from the radio button in a variable
[11:29:25] <shoky> silverdust: no. store the currently edited pin element. e.g. the last one that was clicked
[11:29:39] <shoky> the last one you cloned
[11:30:04] <shoky> silverdust: https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/s9ph9jr3/4/
[11:30:15] <shoky> couldn't be simpler..
[11:33:49] <silverdust> hmm notice it doesn't update beyond 2
[11:33:55] <shoky> what?
[11:34:41] <shoky> it's just appending the radio's value
[11:34:44] <shoky> 1 or 2 :)
[11:34:55] <silverdust> ha no
[11:35:06] <silverdust> I was wrong. I see what you did now
[11:35:08] <silverdust> Thanks
[11:35:14] <shoky> np
[11:36:35] <Es0teric> who has used jquery ui sortable? i have a question
[11:38:04] <shoky> people who have used it have used it. just ask your question :|
[11:40:21] <decx> i used to use it
[11:40:26] <decx> i still use it but i used to too
[11:45:40] <Es0teric> decx alright well right now for some reason when i move an item in the sortable to a different position, the other items seem to not have updated positions
[11:46:06] <Es0teric> so if i have 0,1,2,3,4 and i move 4 to 0, 4 is now 0 but 0 is not 1
[11:46:23] <decx> well what is 0 then
[11:46:33] <Es0teric> decx 0 is the first position
[11:46:44] <decx> yeah but was is the old 0 now
[11:46:50] <decx> if not 1
[11:50:01] <Es0teric> decx wait i am not following your question
[11:50:31] <decx> if 4 is now 0 and 0 is not one then what is 0 now
[11:50:38] <decx> it's like the back alley puzzle in monkey island 2
[11:51:49] <Es0teric> decx 0 stays 0
[11:51:55] <Es0teric> so now there are two 0's
[11:52:08] <decx> is it tho
[11:52:09] <decx> fiddle up
[11:52:10] <Es0teric> yeah
[11:52:19] <Es0teric> it is 0
[11:52:22] <Es0teric> because thats what was saved in the db
[11:52:26] <Es0teric> it was not updated
[11:52:49] <Es0teric> i guess my question now is how do i simultaneously update each position of each item
[11:52:54] <Es0teric> if it doesnt do it on its own
[11:54:06] <Es0teric> decx
[11:54:48] <decx> makes sense tho
[11:55:00] <decx> for position you might want to have multiple with the same order
[11:55:07] <decx> just send index to your db ?
[11:55:12] <Es0teric> decx yeah
[11:55:24] <Es0teric> i just send the index to the db but i need js to update the new index when items are sorted
[11:55:35] <decx> no you send the position
[11:55:49] <Es0teric> decx the index is the position
[11:57:19] <decx> then that doesnt make sense
[11:57:23] <decx> fiddle
[11:57:30] <Es0teric> decx i dont have the time for a fiddle
[11:57:33] <Es0teric> i just need to know the logic of it
[11:57:52] <decx> well good luck
[11:58:03] <Es0teric> and how does it not make sense that the index is the position?
[11:58:08] <Es0teric> how else would you get the position?
[11:59:38] <decx> it's updating just fine here https://jsfiddle.net/wn2ebx27/
[12:00:04] <Es0teric> decx you are not understanding
[12:00:18] <decx> yeah cause you dont make sense
[12:00:19] <Es0teric> decx i have a position stored in the database already
[12:00:22] <Es0teric> so its not updating the positon stored in the database
[12:00:33] <decx> why would it?
[12:00:49] <Es0teric> decx because they are values inside a hidden field
[12:01:22] <decx> so you'Re saying it has nothing to do with sortable and everything with your implementation :p
[12:01:33] <Es0teric> as my previous example stated, 0,1,2,3,4 are positions coming from a db... if i move 4 to 0, 4 becomes 0 but the item that was 0 does not become 1
[12:01:52] <Es0teric> the value stays as 0
[12:02:05] <Es0teric> i want to update the value to 1 or whatever position its going to be based off the sortable
[12:02:08] <Es0teric> thats my problem
[12:03:07] <Es0teric> decx does that make more sense?
[12:04:03] <decx> if you send to your backend that 4 is now 0 then you have to do the footwork yourself to shift the other indexes
[12:04:21] <Es0teric> nvm i think i figured it out
[12:20:59] <jen_> Are there open source ecommerce shopping carts built using only HTML and JS/JQ?
[12:21:33] <Uhkis> probably with node
[12:21:42] <robertmaxrees> jen_ do you mean with no real server-side?
[12:21:58] <jen_> well, we would need a database
[12:21:59] <robertmaxrees> because an entirely client-side shopping cart is a little... funky.
[12:22:27] <robertmaxrees> then you'd need a server-side language of some kind.
[12:22:27] <Uhkis> would be awesome though, everything at 0 price!
[12:22:32] <robertmaxrees> js would be possible.
[12:22:33] <jen_> php
[12:22:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd try asking in #web and ##php.
[12:23:07] <jen_> i know 90% of carts use PHP for server side
[12:23:08] <robertmaxrees> magento is a choice.
[12:23:11] <kevin> hey uhhm so i have a question with iframes, i dunno what channel to ask... so i am developing on localhost, and i have an iframe pointing to a page on a different host... chrome says "refused to display... because X-Frame-Options set to 'ALLOW-FROM http://localhost:8080, SAMEORIGIN' ... but the host i am requesting from is indeed http://localhost:8080 ... any ideas?
[12:23:19] <robertmaxrees> jen_ that's not entirely accurate, but okay :)
[12:23:27] <Uhkis> https://reactioncommerce.com/ there you go
[12:23:44] <jen_> kevin: you need to research CORS
[12:23:48] <robertmaxrees> kevin what domain is the iframe on?
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> and what's the domain of the parent window?
[12:24:02] <jen_> add that to your .htaccess file to grant access to parent page
[12:24:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:24:10] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees: hello! when you have a moment i have a question for you
[12:24:16] <robertmaxrees> jen_ that's bad advice.
[12:24:37] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey there are over 600 people in here :) just ask your question.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[12:24:51] <jen_> ok, add it to your vhost
[12:24:58] <robertmaxrees> jen_ don't do that either.
[12:25:02] <robertmaxrees> don't open cors just because.
[12:25:05] <kevin> robertmaxrees, the host is some internal host (lets just call it appserver.com) , so i'm doing <iframe src="http://appserver.com/somepage.jsp"></iframe> in my index.html on http://localhost:8080/index.html ... somepage.jsp is returning "X-Frame-Options": ALLOW-FROM http://localhost:8080/
[12:25:07] <jen_> AJAX?
[12:25:17] <jen_> JSONP?
[12:25:23] <robertmaxrees> jen_ you're just tossing out terms and words now ;)
[12:25:28] <jen_> all good ways to avoid cross domain commuincation
[12:25:41] <jen_> issues
[12:25:48] <mchu> does this chatroom do Jquery and JS?
[12:25:55] <robertmaxrees> mchu jq IS JS sooo... ;)
[12:26:02] <mchu> hah okay.
[12:26:03] <robertmaxrees> kevin yeah reead up on CORS and how to properly set those headers.
[12:26:05] <kevin> robertmaxrees, any idea? i'm really stumped.
[12:26:06] <BetaFrey> Can i have a modal button on one page, and the content of the modal be saved elseware so that i dont have ugly pages i'm trying to find a site with the best practices -- sorry robertmaxrees i just thought you maybe  knew some more sites in addition to the nice list you gave me yesterday.
[12:26:07] <mchu> need some help here!
[12:26:14] <kevin> uhm
[12:26:18] <mchu> can i use another pair of eyes to find my issue/error? the explanation is in html box. thanks guys! really need help here. https://jsfiddle.net/ryk3hkdc/
[12:26:20] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey huh?
[12:26:20] <kevin> hmm ok
[12:27:00] <BetaFrey> You goave me soem nice resource sites yesterday andi  thought maybe you would know some more robertmaxrees
[12:27:35] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey not sure what exactly you're getting at
[12:27:44] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey you mean you don't want the markup for the modal on the same page?
[12:27:50] <jen_> robertmaxrees: if we use Paypal, Amazon or Google checkout, I think a pure client side checkout is possible. http://simplecartjs.org/features
[12:27:55] <mchu> can somebody take a took ? :D
[12:28:06] <BetaFrey> Yes i wanted to find some websites that talked about modals so i can do that robertmaxrees
[12:28:07] <jen_> i have been dabbling with WP Woocommerce and talk about code bloat.
[12:28:09] <robertmaxrees> jen_ it's possible, but you're going to miss out on a lot of features people will expect.
[12:28:45] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey why is having the html for a modal on the page an issue?
[12:28:51] <jen_> i thought so...
[12:28:53] <robertmaxrees> it'll have to be there at some point regardless.
[12:28:58] <jen_> what cart system do you recommend?
[12:29:20] <BetaFrey> because it would be on the site master page robertmaxrees and I would have 5 or 6 modals on the site master
[12:30:00] <jen_> kevin:  add this to your .htaccess file: Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
[12:30:08] <jen_> that’s a start
[12:30:20] <jen_> I am assuming you have control over both sites
[12:30:24] <jen_> parent and child
[12:30:29] <robertmaxrees> jen_ we built our own.
[12:30:38] <robertmaxrees> jen_ please don't tell people just to enable CORS like that.
[12:30:40] <Uhkis> mchu: maybe start with checking what that request actually contains with different values
[12:30:43] <robertmaxrees> that's dangerous advice ;)
[12:30:50] <jen_> works for me!
[12:30:52] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey huh?
[12:31:02] <jen_> :)
[12:31:02] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey you could create partials elsewhere and bring them in.
[12:31:17] <mchu> Uhkis: the request contains only the city, state, and zip
[12:31:36] <jen_> robertmaxrees: what backend language do you use?
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> jen_ sorry, but there's a very good reason for CORS - need to be careful telling people to circumvent it without understanding what they're doing.
[12:31:51] <Uhkis> mchu: with prevented and non-prevented?
[12:31:53] <robertmaxrees> jen_ our legacy system is CF (don't use that), but our new system is node.
[12:31:54] <jen_> ahhh…I got ya…
[12:31:57] <robertmaxrees> with a java services layer.
[12:32:00] <hlvwrk> hey uh. is there any way to clean up this regex replace? phrase.val().replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm," ").replace(/\s+/g," ");    The first .replace replaces line breaks with two spaces, and the second .replace replaces the two spaces with a single space
[12:32:04] <hlvwrk> it seems clunky though
[12:32:17] <jen_> did I let a cat out of the bag? are you thinking it could be malicious robertmaxrees
[12:32:26] <BetaFrey> Currently each is it's own aspx page and instead i want them to pop up as a modal instead of a "window" so i was just tryign to search about it robertmaxrees i havn't really used modals
[12:32:32] <hlvwrk> ;
[12:32:47] <BetaFrey> so I am just trying to find some good reading material on how they work :S
[12:32:49] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey you're getting way ahead of yourself.  create partials and include those on the pages that need them.
[12:32:55] <hlvwrk> eyo. corky.
[12:32:57] <Uhkis> hlvwrk: looks like exactly what i did
[12:33:03] <hlvwrk> what?
[12:33:08] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:33:11] <robertmaxrees> jen_ huh?  circumventing CORS can be dangerous.
[12:33:18] <BetaFrey> I don't even know what partials means robertmaxrees :S
[12:33:19] <Uhkis> hlvwrk: i think i skipped \r though
[12:33:23] <hlvwrk> ahh
[12:33:33] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey small files that you pull in to your main application.
[12:33:36] <hlvwrk> is there no way to clean that up though?
[12:33:44] <hlvwrk> the two .replaces just seems messy
[12:33:56] <robertmaxrees> so instead of one big file with all your stuff you do some smaller files and import them where you need them BetaFrey
[12:34:07] <jen_> well, hopefully they can see that using cors you can set specific access from parent domains and not the entire world…that’s why we both preface go learn about CORS
[12:34:09] <Uhkis> hlvwrk: still less messy than adding that whitespace cleanup on that first one
[12:34:14] <mchu> Uhkis: yes , same . just checked
[12:34:32] <robertmaxrees> jen_ right but then you handed them the thing that doesn't do that.  see the issue?
[12:34:34] <hlvwrk> true.
[12:34:39] <robertmaxrees> gave them a nice footgun ;)
[12:34:42] <BetaFrey> They already exist as their own files robertmaxrees and onclick they are poping up as a window, i just thought it would look nicer if they poped up in a modal
[12:34:54] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey then get a modaling library and go to town.
[12:35:00] <jen_> yes, I * grants access to anyone@
[12:35:01] <jen_> oops
[12:35:04] <hlvwrk> i just feel like i could make it more simple
[12:35:05] <hlvwrk> idk
[12:35:08] <jen_> i know…bad bad gir.
[12:35:10] <jen_> l
[12:35:11] <Uhkis> hlvwrk: in term of readability both of those regexes could go to a variable
[12:35:18] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey they're not full pages, right?
[12:35:24] <robertmaxrees> like, it's just the small bit of HTML you need?
[12:35:42] <hlvwrk> ooo. that'd be better.
[12:35:43] <hlvwrk> Good idea.
[12:35:44] <hlvwrk> thanks
[12:38:46] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees: let me try some things and get back to you?
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey uh, okay?
[12:39:06] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey you didn't answer my question
[12:39:12] <BetaFrey> i dont know robertmaxrees they are being used with telerik
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey when you click those links you go to new pages right?  do they have your header and stuff on them?
[12:39:37] <Uhkis> mchu: must be somewhere in that cityStateZipMatch
[12:39:42] <BetaFrey> but i think i can just pull off the tops of the pages / bottopms and have only the content i need there.
[12:39:55] <robertmaxrees> BetaFrey yeah, you need to just have the content of the modal in those.
[12:39:58] <BetaFrey> it pops up a new page over the existing page
[12:40:02] <robertmaxrees> then pick a modaling library and go to town.
[12:40:19] <robertmaxrees> if you view page source on those, you don't see a <head> and stuff, right?
[12:40:26] <BetaFrey> yeah so i'll go research modaling library and thanks
[12:40:33] <robertmaxrees> sure :)
[12:40:42] <mchu> Uhkis: heres the cityStateZipMatch function. https://jsfiddle.net/rkrj92zs/
[12:42:34] <Uhkis> mchu: typeof count differs on preventdefault on/off?
[12:43:04] <Uhkis> mchu: or any of those 3 db is receiving
[12:44:57] <mchu> Uhkis: yup everything is the same
[12:45:03] <mchu> count is the same
[12:46:39] <Uhkis> no idea then, maybe there's ghosts in your machine :D
[12:47:17] <mchu> is it because cityStateZipMatch isnt specific enough?
[12:47:41] <Uhkis> if everything is the same and works differently, it makes no sense
[12:51:53] <Uhkis> afaik preventDefault() shouldn't do anything to those values
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> peventDefault() just stops the default action of the form from happening.
[12:52:25] <mchu> robertmaxrees: you mind taking a look at my code?
[12:52:59] <robertmaxrees> i took a look and closed it when i saw a ton of code and a paragraph of text ;)
[12:53:09] <mchu> so when i dont remove prevent default, instead of rending to a new page, it appends the Entire Doc Page
[12:53:15] <mchu> robertmaxrees: oh haha sorry
[12:53:22] <mchu> robertmaxrees: i can show less of it,
[12:53:33] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down :)
[12:53:35] <mchu> im really stuck :(
[12:53:37] <robertmaxrees> what's the first problem?
[12:54:05] <mchu> so let me just tell you the issue im trying to fix. btw, this code isnt mine. its an open source project
[12:54:27] <robertmaxrees> wait okay.
[12:54:30] <mchu> so right now, the issue is that you can enter in a city, zip, and state that does not match and when you click submit, everythign will work fine
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[12:54:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:55:02] <mchu> walk me thru this . im miserable working on this same thing :(
[12:55:30] <game0000> I need proffesional jquery
[12:55:36] <robertmaxrees> game0000 huh?
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> mchu this is your first problem :) you're showing us code without context.  link the project and explain the issue you're having.
[12:56:01] <robertmaxrees> like, "when i do x, i expect y to happen, but z happens instead.
[12:56:13] <robertmaxrees> game0000 if you're looking to recruit, you're not in the right place :)
[12:57:04] <robertmaxrees> mchu link it in here.
[12:57:10] <robertmaxrees> no need to PM me :)
[12:57:12] <game0000> no just facing a small problem
[12:57:16] <mchu> it was just the link
[12:57:16] <game0000> https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/3amodLvr/
[12:57:17] <mchu> haha
[12:57:22] <game0000> this is the link for my code
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> game0000 then ask your question.  if somebody can help, they Willis
[12:57:29] <robertmaxrees> err, will
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> mchu just toss the link out here.
[12:57:40] <robertmaxrees> dunno why it needs to be a secret.
[12:57:42] <mchu> https://github.com/redcross/smoke-alarm-portal/blob/master/views/index.js
[12:57:59] <robertmaxrees> game0000 so what's your question?
[12:58:48] <game0000> It's a simple math system, I've done the part of writing questions and I'm now want to replace the input text with the answer that the user entered with correct or wrong sign
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> mchu so what's the question?
[12:59:10] <game0000> after the user click on check answer button, robetmaxrees
[12:59:21] <robertmaxrees> game0000 what about it?
[13:00:22] <game0000> when he clicks on check answer button it should show correct or wrong sign after replacing the input text with the answer that he entered
[13:00:25] <mchu> robertmaxrees when i click submit (everything matches), instead of rendering a new page, it appends the entire page as an ajax call above the form
[13:00:36] <game0000> robertmaxrees, did you got my question
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> game0000 okay.  you need an event listener.
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> game0000 start there.
[13:00:53] <game0000> yes, something like that
[13:00:55] <robertmaxrees> mchu this looks like it's apart of a bigger project.
[13:01:02] <robertmaxrees> game0000 right.  so what's your question?
[13:01:39] <game0000> I don't know how to do it, I need someone to help me with that
[13:01:46] <mchu> robertmaxrees: originally, you can submit an incorrect address. so i create a cityZipStateMatch function to correct that.
[13:01:52] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/ game0000
[13:01:54] <robertmaxrees> just this out.
[13:01:57] <robertmaxrees> *check this out
[13:02:35] <robertmaxrees> errr, so what's the code you wrote?
[13:04:44] <mchu> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/rkrj92zs/
[13:05:05] <robertmaxrees> okay so back up.
[13:05:18] <mchu> crap, that link didnt update
[13:05:24] <mchu> how do i update my changes on jsfiddle
[13:05:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to hit update
[13:05:29] <robertmaxrees> upper left.
[13:05:33] <robertmaxrees> then share the new link.
[13:05:45] <mchu> oh haha mybad
[13:05:46] <mchu> https://jsfiddle.net/rkrj92zs/1/
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> okay - so what fails?
[13:15:40] <mchu> so after the else statement on line 45, it should run everything afterwards (like rending a new page) but instead it appends the new page’s doc
[13:16:07] <mchu> and in the github link i sent you, i guess this might be more clear maybe… everything after line 415 fails. and i think i mightve find where it’s failing
[13:16:20] <mchu> robertmaxrees:
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> mchu what does db.UsAddress.count return?
[13:21:05] <robertmaxrees> also: you might contact the maintainers to ask them how they might implement something like this.
[13:21:07] <mchu> robertmaxrees: gets the address from the zip code in the request
[13:23:13] <robertmaxrees> what type is that object though?
[13:23:26] <harry1> I am trying to target the label on the last line of this gist: what am I doing wrong?
[13:23:28] <harry1> https://gist.github.com/spacebiscuit/7ba207ac4111be27169c
[13:23:34] <robertmaxrees> like, does it really just return the value mchu?
[13:23:38] <mchu> do you mind if i send something with 6 lines?
[13:23:49] <mchu> its the object.
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> mchu share it in the channel duder.
[13:24:15] <robertmaxrees> but that explains your issue.
[13:24:17] <mchu> { _bitField: 2097152,
[13:24:18] <mchu>   _fulfillmentHandler0: undefined,
[13:24:19] <mchu>   _rejectionHandler0: undefined,
[13:24:21] <mchu>   _promise0: undefined,
[13:24:21] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:24:22] <mchu>   _receiver0: undefined,
[13:24:23] <mchu>   _boundTo: UsAddress }
[13:24:23] <robertmaxrees> not like that.
[13:24:23] <mchu> s0rry everybody!
[13:24:35] <mchu> whoa sorry . i sent it after i saw your message
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> and it looks like the promise is hosed.
[13:24:44] <harry1> in my example the class is targeted but so is another label in a parent div at the same level
[13:26:08] <taplar> harry1: i believe you have :first-child wrong
[13:26:50] <harry1> taplar: thanks, any hints?
[13:26:51] <taplar> or maybe not.  are you thinking it's getting the first fieldset or the first child of the field set?
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> harry1 mind updating https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4n8g7sv9/1/ with more markup?
[13:27:16] <mchu> robertmaxrees: on line 415 in the github, countRequestsPerRegion is returning 0 and undefines. do u think something is wrong w/ that function? or i need to edit it
[13:27:26] <harry1> the first div below fieldset
[13:27:51] <robertmaxrees> harry1 update the fiddle with more indicative markup.
[13:27:52] <taplar> element:first-child is the where the element is the first child of it's parent
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> mchu does the promise properly run?
[13:28:17] <robertmaxrees> like, if you console log those values, are they what you think they are?
[13:28:44] <harry1> robertmaxrees: that targets the label but also another label at the same level
[13:28:49] <harry1> let me update my gist
[13:28:57] <robertmaxrees> harry1 update the fiddle duder.
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> let's us actually play with it and show you ;)
[13:31:14] <harry1> robertmaxrees: see the fiddle now
[13:31:28] <robertmaxrees> harry1 you need to hit update and toss out a new link :)
[13:31:57] <harry1> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/2/
[13:32:06] <harry1> the class is applied to both labels
[13:32:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:32:37] <robertmaxrees> you have the active class manually applied to the second one.
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> so like what's the context here?
[13:33:39] <taplar> yeah, if you want it to target just the first one you need a space before your :first-child
[13:33:52] <robertmaxrees> why do you need that first label?
[13:34:14] <harry1> sorry I had lifted the code form hmtl source
[13:34:15] <harry1> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/3/
[13:34:29] <mchu> robertmaxrees: i believe it does. I ran those code and console logged everything an compared it to the original code and also console logged. Everything came out the same.
[13:34:31] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like, why not just do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4n8g7sv9/4/?
[13:34:54] <harry1> ok sometimes there are two labels, sometimes one
[13:35:00] <harry1> whichever is first needs the active class
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> harry1 right, so why not do what i just shared?
[13:35:21] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, maybe do this server-side?
[13:35:37] <robertmaxrees> just trying to understand the impetus here.
[13:36:13] <harry1> sure... in your example it wouldn;t work if only the SINGLE class div was rendered
[13:37:00] <robertmaxrees> harry1 okay.  so you always just want the first one?  'cause that's easy to handle server-side
[13:37:15] <harry1> yes correct
[13:37:26] <robertmaxrees> so why not do it server-side?
[13:37:26] <harry1> but this is an old old cms
[13:37:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:38:03] <harry1> I can't really afford to change classes as it will collapse
[13:38:21] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't change, i'd just add.
[13:38:22] <harry1> I could do an if else but in my view that's fragile
[13:38:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/5/
[13:38:48] <harry1> so i thought if i could just target the first it would work in all casses
[13:39:43] <harry1> taplar: thanks, but that assums that .donationTypeREGULAR is always first doesn't it
[13:39:50] <taplar> no
[13:39:53] <harry1> if .donationTypeSINGLE is first it wouldn't work
[13:39:58] <taplar> ?
[13:40:02] <taplar> no
[13:40:05] <robertmaxrees> also: since this is the "Default" view for the page you really don't want to do this with JS, but ok.
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:40:08] <taplar> first() gets the first result of the result set
[13:41:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/6/
[13:42:23] <harry1> taplar: in that last example 'bar' should be highlighted active
[13:42:41] <taplar> huh?
[13:42:42] <harry1> robertmaxrees: oh i know this such a bad approach
[13:42:55] <harry1> i spent most of today finding how this default was set
[13:43:07] <harry1> my last resort was a grep search on the js folder
[13:43:24] <harry1> i was cursing the idiot who thought this was the way to go :)
[13:43:29] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:43:45] <robertmaxrees> you know you could do this with just CSS, right?
[13:43:56] <harry1> go on..
[13:44:50] <harry1> taplar: in all cases the first item should be 'active'
[13:46:30] <harry1> still struggling to see why both are highlighted ehre though
[13:46:31] <harry1> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/9/
[13:47:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/10/
[13:47:52] <harry1> think i have it
[13:47:53] <harry1> https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/14/
[13:48:10] <taplar> :/
[13:48:29] <harry1> yay
[13:48:36] <harry1> thnaks guys \0/
[13:51:21] <taplar> btw, completely off topic.  but it's kinda strange that they can map your eyeballs now days, :)
[13:53:38] <harry1> hmm not quite out of the water yet: https://jsfiddle.net/4n8g7sv9/15/
[13:53:45] <robertmaxrees> why not use CSS for this?
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> really confused.
[13:53:58] <harry1> I missed a 'legend'
[13:54:16] <harry1> robertmaxrees: would that be a nth child in css?
[13:54:21] <taplar> the div isn't the first child
[13:54:57] <taplar> really wish you could get away from the position based logic...
[14:00:25] <harry1> taplar not sure how else to do this without adding extra classes
[14:00:49] <taplar> right, which would be less fragile
[14:01:11] <robertmaxrees> which was a stated concern earlier :)
[14:01:36] <harry1> this isn't just a case of editing a template that makes the divs
[14:01:52] <harry1> it's a 10 year old custom cms which uses helpers to generate absolutely anything
[14:02:16] <taplar> seems like a band-aid
[14:02:17] <harry1> it's insane,just to be able to add a class or div without documentation is an ordeal
[14:02:26] <harry1> totally on its last legs
[14:05:22] <harry1> thanks guys - I have it working at least
[14:05:29] <harry1> i know it's not the greatest solution
[14:05:44] <harry1> but as a tmep fix that houldn't breka it iwll do
[14:05:49] <harry1> appreciate your help
[14:05:54] <harry1> taplar: ^
[14:05:56] <harry1> robertmaxrees: ^
[14:07:03] <taplar> sure
[14:11:29] <nsosa> hello
[14:12:48] <nsosa> can anyone help me with this? https://jsfiddle.net/q5cad9ad/  I would like to send the serialized data and the image in a single ajax request, how can I do it.
[14:16:11] <robertmaxrees> nsosa http://blog.w3villa.com/websites/uploading-filesimage-with-ajax-jquery-without-submitting-a-form/
[14:16:43] <nsosa> robert: but I would like to send the image file and the form in one request
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:16:59] <robertmaxrees> did you not look at that link?
[14:17:21] <nsosa> yes
[14:17:27] <nsosa> that looks like it is only sending an image
[14:17:30] <nsosa> the form
[14:17:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:17:33] <robertmaxrees> thjen you didn't read it.
[14:17:47] <robertmaxrees> you can append all your form content.
[14:17:54] <nsosa> oh
[14:18:07] <robertmaxrees> skipping to code snippets and not reading doesn't get you very far ;)
[14:18:24] <nsosa> I see it
[14:18:27] <nsosa> in formdata.append
[14:19:33] <nsosa> I will try that thank you!!
[14:28:24] <nsosa> ok I understand the example now
[14:28:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:28:43] <nsosa> but what if I want to send a form field, I cannot pass the serialize to append
[14:30:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:30:34] <nsosa> if I have var name = $('#name');
[14:30:56] <nsosa> do I  just formData.append(name) ?
[14:31:04] <nsosa> or do I append the serialize
[14:31:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[14:31:23] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/append
[14:32:54] <kevin> i am pulllllling my hair out now. so i am trying to get an ajax "xml json" data type in my request. so, when i use dataType:"xml" everything is fine, but when i do dataType:"xml json",  my converter gets called, but it doesnt receive any arguments (ie, it doesnt get the xml structure to transform into json)... thoughts?
[14:33:05] <robertmaxrees> "XML JSON" is not a thing.
[14:33:14] <robertmaxrees> which format do you want?
[14:33:54] <kevin> the server responds in xml, and i want it to automatically convert to json. using the "multiple, space-separated values" as listed in http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:34:20] <robertmaxrees> so what are you getting in your .then()?
[14:35:17] <kevin> just a simple function(data){} callback
[14:35:29] <robertmaxrees> right, so what's the data you're getting?
[14:35:33] <robertmaxrees> or is it going to the fail?
[14:35:58] <kevin> it's null, and thats because my "xml json" converter function gets a null argument passed to it
[14:36:17] <robertmaxrees> oh, so you wrote your own converter?  can you share some code?
[14:36:22] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've got?
[14:36:36] <kevin> it's a library, lemme find out which one
[14:36:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:38] <kevin> i'm using xml2json from https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js , and i basically just have an ajax converter for "xml json" that is just function(data) { return $.xml2json(data); }
[14:39:58] <kevin> but for some reason, that converter gets null for data
[14:40:03] <robertmaxrees> jquery should be able to do that for you.
[14:40:18] <nsosa> thank you robert
[14:40:20] <nsosa> !
[14:40:22] <nsosa> for your help
[14:40:33] <robertmaxrees> kevin not sure why you're adding another lib.
[14:42:04] <kevin> robertmaxrees, hmm? you're saying xml-to-json conversion is standard within jquery?
[14:42:37] <robertmaxrees> the docs seem to suggest it works.
[14:44:16] <kevin> yeah i thought it "supports" converting between data types but you have to supply the converter. looking at the default for converters, doesn't have "xml json" listed
[14:46:48] <robertmaxrees> have you tried it without?
[14:47:43] <tbb_B> hi, could you please take a look at here -> https://jsfiddle.net/03qr7fz2/2/
[14:48:06] <robertmaxrees> tbb_B what's up?
[14:48:37] <tbb_B> i need to know how to do something with the first 2 rows
[14:49:01] <robertmaxrees> is it always the first two?
[14:49:03] <tbb_B> not has or anything like that
[14:49:17] <tbb_B> no no no, its sample for easy reading
[14:49:23] <robertmaxrees> then what's your criteria?
[14:49:43] <tbb_B> could you take a look at here https://jsfiddle.net/03qr7fz2/2/
[14:49:49] <robertmaxrees> riogjht, that's not clear to me.
[14:49:57] <robertmaxrees> you want all of the rows that DON'T contain <span class="a10">
[14:49:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:50:41] <robertmaxrees> tbb_B ^
[14:50:41] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:50:49] <tbb_B> yes but only if the <td> in first place got a !
[14:51:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:51:51] <tbb_B> if tr td has ! then search for span which does not contains a specific class
[14:52:06] <robertmaxrees> so you want all rows that don't contain <span class="a10"> and that also contain td class="a13?  or just a td whose contents are ! ?
[14:55:43] <tbb_B> only the td's with class a 13 if they have an ! in it and not a span with class a10 in the same row
[14:55:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:55:54] <robertmaxrees> this is really complex.
[14:57:30] <robertmaxrees> so you want all trs if their child a13 contains a ! and there isn't also an a10 present in that same row.
[14:57:32] <tbb_B> i guess i am not explaining it right. i  just want the opposite from my example, something like in line 11
[14:57:33] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[14:57:43] <robertmaxrees> tbb_B the issue is 'the opposite is ephemeral.
[14:58:04] <robertmaxrees> i could get you the opposite in dozens of ways.
[14:58:19] <robertmaxrees> check out using .filter() with a function.
[15:00:03] <robertmaxrees> something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/03qr7fz2/3/
[15:00:37] <kevin> robertmaxrees, ohhh. it's actually an issue with another library i'm using. mockjax. sorry
[15:00:49] <robertmaxrees> kevin hah :) it's all good :)
[15:01:21] <tbb_B> i haven't used filter im newbie,  i will take a look at it thx
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> tbb_B check out the fiddle i posted - shows you an example.
[15:03:00] <tbb_B> yeah i had, i'm trying to understand it, it seems exactly what i want
[15:03:02] <tbb_B> thx
[15:03:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[15:16:27] <jen_> robertmaxrees: Robert…getting back to shopping cart using node.  I am vaguely familiar with node.  In fact, I am very elementary with JS - I am mostly a front end person.  We are trying to use Woocommerce for our ecommerce stuff.
[15:16:59] <jen_> I know a little PHP but thinking if I learn JS - that can help with front end, apps and possibly our shopping cart work.
[15:17:03] <robertmaxrees> that should have a cart available.
[15:17:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, they have one.
[15:17:32] <jen_> but we will need a CMS for customer data etc...
[15:17:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:17:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm way confused.
[15:17:59] <jen_> sorry..I guess you can interface MYSQL with node?
[15:18:10] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you just using woocommerce?
[15:18:35] <robertmaxrees> like, i really don't understand why you don't just use the platform you have.
[15:18:40] <jen_> well…like I said…I’d have to learn PHP to really hack the code there.
[15:18:43] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:18:46] <robertmaxrees> so do that.
[15:18:53] <robertmaxrees> mixing and matching platforms like that is not for the faint of heart.
[15:18:59] <robertmaxrees> trust me - we're doing it where I work.
[15:19:19] <robertmaxrees> keep everything in woocommerce.  learn php.
[15:19:32] <jen_> I am at the juncture where I need to decide do I learn PHP for the cart or learn JS for the cart in addition to our landing pages etc.
[15:19:39] <robertmaxrees> learn both.
[15:19:42] <jen_> hah
[15:19:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not a "one or the other" proposition.
[15:19:54] <jen_> gotcha
[15:20:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm totally serious - once you learn one language, others become much easier.
[15:20:07] <robertmaxrees> skip the js for now.
[15:20:09] <robertmaxrees> do the PHP :)
[15:20:29] <jen_> but you’ve used node which is “exclusively” JS and JQeury right?
[15:20:32] <jen_> along with html
[15:20:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:20:45] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[15:21:03] <jen_> guess so…don’t know much about node and angular
[15:21:05] <jen_> i guess
[15:21:05] <robertmaxrees> jQuery is js.  node doesn't really use much jQuery
[15:21:14] <jen_> ok
[15:21:16] <robertmaxrees> you also don't want to mix and match two platforms.
[15:21:17] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[15:21:19] <robertmaxrees> it's a very bad idea.
[15:21:43] <jen_> so, you suggest, grab a book and learn PHP to finish off the woocommerce cart?
[15:21:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:21:53] <jen_> then learn JS sometime down the road?
[15:22:06] <jen_> I am fluent in HTML and CSS which, I know, isn’t saying a lot.
[15:22:12] <robertmaxrees> what languages do you know?  just html and css?
[15:22:30] * jen_ embarrased to say —> applescript
[15:22:36] <robertmaxrees> don't be embarassed at all.
[15:22:42] <jen_> and a bit of PHP
[15:22:54] <arc_> applescript is actually extremely helpful in learning how the logic of programming works
[15:22:56] <jen_> but not to the point where someone said - start coding a timer for me.
[15:23:09] * jen_ still embarrassed.
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you haven't yet experienced the thing where once you learn one language you start learning others much more easily.
[15:23:45] <jen_> i do these 2 day video sessions on JS and PHP but that’s crap...
[15:23:53] <robertmaxrees> don't do sessions.
[15:23:55] <robertmaxrees> build things.
[15:24:03] <jen_> I need to sit down and take a class or read a book for 4-6 weeks and use it.
[15:24:14] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:24:16] <robertmaxrees> just use it.
[15:24:19] <jen_> i presume you know both
[15:24:19] <arc_> people learn different ways but i always find that having a problem i need to solve and figuring out how to solve it is the best way i learn something
[15:24:22] <jen_> js and php
[15:24:30] <arc_> just trying to practice examples and shit is like ... snoozefest
[15:24:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP.
[15:24:33] <jen_> arc_: that
[15:24:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't particularly like it and i'd never elect to use it.
[15:24:52] <jen_> that’s called hacking and trust me…that’s probably the slowest way to learn something.
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> no it's not :)
[15:25:02] <jen_> python?
[15:25:04] <robertmaxrees> that's call "learning how to become a developer"
[15:25:21] <arc_> slower than another way? maybe. but i don't need to learn As Fast As Possible, i just need to make sure i learn it right
[15:25:22] <Uhkis> wow, react is not fun
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> i know enough python, java, c#, asp, cf, and a few others i'm not thinking of.
[15:25:44] <jen_> well, being a one-person band, I handle all our adverstising (adwords), front end, etc.
[15:25:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:25:54] <robertmaxrees> so keep learning :)
[15:26:51] <jen_> i have a java developer doing our desktop apps but now I see there is electron, which is purely html, css, and JS…and this got me thinking…wow, imagine if I just learn JS - i can get rid of my java guy who is starting to take me to the bank.
[15:27:07] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> he's going to have something you don't.
[15:27:46] <jen_> well, if we can write a desktop app with electron, I’d have to learn JS.
[15:27:54] <jen_> not that beast called java
[15:27:59] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:28:01] <robertmaxrees> java has uses.
[15:28:03] <robertmaxrees> our backend uses it.
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> an electron isn't necessarily your best bet.
[15:28:21] <robertmaxrees> and he has experience.  something you need ;)
[15:28:27] <jen_> i know…there are tons of mature libraries but the damn language is archaic.
[15:28:29] <Uhkis> java has so bad rep because those vulnerable browser applets
[15:28:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not paying for the language, you're paying for the experience.
[15:28:42] <robertmaxrees> jen_ actually it's not.
[15:28:49] <robertmaxrees> recent releases of java have surprisingly modern features.
[15:28:57] <robertmaxrees> it's not a bad language any more.
[15:29:00] <robertmaxrees> surprisingly fast, too.
[15:29:17] <jen_> we orginally started out desktop apps with Adobe Air Flex framework…switched to python and now we settled on java
[15:29:22] <tbb_B> robertmaxrees: in my example i have allready found the specific td (contains a lot more) and i have parsed the time out how can i access the columns from the current tr in your example
[15:29:23] <tbb_B> https://jsfiddle.net/03qr7fz2/5/
[15:29:39] <robertmaxrees> jen_ yep.  sounds about right.
[15:29:42] <robertmaxrees> tbb_B don't use alert()
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> use console.log()
[15:30:04] <robertmaxrees> and you have the TRs.  use .find() to get the TDs.
[15:30:05] <jen_> thanks for your time…so, you say learn PHP...
[15:30:06] <tbb_B> ok sorry
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> jen_ yeah.  in your case, it's the right tool for the job.
[15:30:19] <jen_> and do the darn cart with woocommerce
[15:30:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> tbb_B http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[15:30:33] <robertmaxrees> you should run through this.
[15:30:41] <jen_> do you think with a strong PHP background, I can pick up on JS fairly fast?
[15:30:47] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:30:57] <robertmaxrees> once you get one language under your belt, you'll pick up others.
[15:31:07] <robertmaxrees> plus even if you only learned JS, you'd need to learn backend languages at some point.
[15:31:09] <Uhkis> ugh, learning PHP is a lot harder than one would think
[15:31:13] <tbb_B> have to go, thx for your time
[15:31:14] <jen_> any suggestions on how I can get started with PHP the right way?
[15:31:20] <robertmaxrees> nah, learning your first language is hard.
[15:31:28] <robertmaxrees> see if ##php has any suggestion.
[15:31:33] <robertmaxrees> *suggestions
[15:31:54] <Uhkis> jen_: you clearly have the right starting point, the right way :)
[15:31:54] <jen_> I learned applescript in 3 weeks, buillt my first desktop app for Mac and that was the start of my business.
[15:32:05] <jen_> :) Uhkis
[15:32:13] <robertmaxrees> jen_ yeah, you'll pick up php pretty quickly then.
[15:32:18] <jen_> thanks so much…nice word in this room…I might stick around.
[15:32:25] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[15:32:38] <Uhkis> as someone who has written php for +10 years, i get so mad when browsing through most of php code i see on github etc
[15:32:42] <taplar> hang with us!
[15:32:55] <jen_> For crying out loud, I’m an organic chemist - I know technical stuff…in fact I proudly hold 12 patents...
[15:33:04] <Uhkis> there's so much bad code out there
[15:33:39] <taplar> heh, probably true for most topics.  such is the internet
[15:33:54] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis so what? ;)
[15:34:01] <robertmaxrees> somebody took it upon themselves to build something.
[15:34:03] <robertmaxrees> and they didit.
[15:34:09] <jen_> my brothers are learning java in college (Comp sci majors)…I feel lost when they are talking about exceptions and classes…I will learn PHP thanks robertmaxrees
[15:34:30] <Uhkis> and now there's yet another horrible php project out there full of sql-injections etc :D
[15:34:33] <robertmaxrees> that's part of what makes jquery great - even if you don't have much experience you can make what you want happen.
[15:34:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery is all about lowering the barrier to entry.  bad code usually just means they need to leanr.
[15:34:59] <robertmaxrees> not the end of the world ;)
[15:35:19] <Uhkis> jen_: php also has classes and exceptions ;)
[15:35:31] <Uhkis> but they're not mandatory
[15:35:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:35:36] <jen_> oh, you mean I can talk with them too…yippeee
[15:35:51] <robertmaxrees> there are some differences, but very similar concepts.
[15:35:56] <jen_> most say learn python and dump PHP - too bloated.
[15:36:09] <robertmaxrees> except that isn't helpful in your case ;)
[15:36:12] <taplar> i luv me some php
[15:36:13] <jen_> yes
[15:36:14] <robertmaxrees> the problem you need to solve is in PHP land.
[15:36:21] <jen_> yes
[15:36:28] <jen_> and php is not going away...
[15:36:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:36:38] <Uhkis> not for a long time
[15:36:54] <jen_> let me hop over to the php boys and ask for directions on how to start learning it the right way
[15:37:02] <jen_> thank you both
[15:37:19] <taplar> mmm that always makes me curious.  'the right way'
[15:38:13] <Uhkis> the right way with php = learn all the traps it has built-in ;D
[15:38:34] <taplar> yeah, but to me that's saying there is 'a way', which seems limited
[15:39:43] <taplar> whatever gets you the knowledge, do it! :)
[17:12:06] <Skipp_OSX> hey, I'm doing the following: $(header).animate({left: position, width: header_width}, 'fast'); and it is ignoring my width parameter and only animating the left parameter, does anyone know why that might be?
[17:12:45] <Skipp_OSX> here header_width alternates between '100%' and 'calc(100% - 208px)'
[17:13:43] <Skipp_OSX> if I do $(header).css('width', header_width); it does work correctly, it doesn't work in the animation though
[17:14:33] <Skipp_OSX> jQuery is version 2.2.0
[17:36:54] <shoky> Skipp_OSX jquery doesn't know `calc`. you can try "-=208px" though.  but why not just use css transitions
[17:46:08] <Skipp_OSX> I didn't know you could do -=208px
[17:48:02] <cangelosx> how do I use jquery to automatically scroll up enough to show the first matched element?
[17:50:09] <silverdust> you mean a search by filter?
[17:51:15] <cangelosx> i dont know if thats redirect at me but
[17:51:32] <cangelosx> im trying to scroll the page back up to the first form input with an error
[17:51:52] <taplar> actually scroll or just go it?
[17:53:32] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[17:54:35] <cangelosx> oh wait, so if I trigger focus on the element, it should automatically scroll up, no?
[17:54:59] <taplar> *shrug* the setter of that method will change the scroll position of the element (such as body)
[17:55:24] <cangelosx> trigger('focus') is exactly what i needed
[17:55:30] <cangelosx> idk why i didnt think of it
[17:56:42] <ferr> I have many #panel-body within page but cannot loop through them or count, .length or .size methods return 1
[17:56:51] <taplar> id's are unique per page
[17:56:57] <taplar> you can't have multiple
[17:57:03] <taplar> use a class
[17:58:21] <ferr> For class it returns 0
[17:58:33] <taplar> show us what your trying
[17:58:50] <ferr> $('panel-body').length;
[17:58:55] <ferr> Do you need page html code?
[17:58:59] <taplar> class selectors start with '.'
[17:59:14] <ferr> Oh lol, I'm so sorry
[17:59:24] <ferr> thanks
[17:59:27] <taplar> sure
[18:05:47] <claytonzaugg> How can I modify the css of one div when another div gets a certain class added to it? This is through mbox injection, so I am limited in what I can do.
[18:06:45] <taplar> what is there dom relationship?
[18:08:15] <claytonzaugg> the code I'm adding is loaded before document ready.  But it doesn't really matter though since I need to change the css after a user scrolls down a certain amount.  Currently when it scrolls, it triggers a "fixed" class to a div when it reaches a certain scrolled down height, I need to trigger my own tweak at the same time.
[18:09:06] <taplar> what is there dom relationship?
[18:09:52] <claytonzaugg> I guess I don't know what you mean.
[18:10:02] <taplar> is one a child of the other?
[18:10:17] <claytonzaugg> No
[18:10:20] <taplar> k
[18:11:01] <taplar> so, something is processing a scroll event and conditionally adding a fixed class
[18:11:30] <taplar> yes?
[18:11:43] <claytonzaugg> yes
[18:11:58] <taplar> have you tried attaching your own scroll event and checking if the element has that class?
[18:12:07] <ferr> taplar: I'm sorry to bother you, but could you take a look at this, please? http://pastie.org/private/qt3tjzzg8dm7x3vewg4ig
[18:12:36] <taplar> ferr: np, what's up?
[18:12:53] <ferr> it sums up the height of all panels instead of the one in the each cycle
[18:13:00] <claytonzaugg> Okay thanks taplar, I'll give that a shot.
[18:13:21] <taplar> claytonzaugg: gl, remember, attachment order determines if your handler will evaluate before or after theirs
[18:13:35] <taplar> ferr: sure, your doing the adjustment to the same element(s) each time
[18:15:27] <taplar> ferr: so the result is it will be set according to whatever the last panel-body evaluation was
[18:16:02] <taplar> what is the desired results?  i'm assuming each panel body contains one of those elements?
[18:16:22] <ferr> taplar: that's correct
[18:16:38] <ferr> I want to set the margin of the .row.buttons according to the panel's height
[18:16:51] <taplar> you need to do a contextual lookup then
[18:17:13] <taplar> var $this = $(this); $this.find('.row.buttons').css("margin-top", $this.height() - 20);
[18:24:29] <ferr> taplar: these 2 lines should be within my each function?
[18:24:34] <taplar> yep
[18:24:48] <taplar> any confusion about what that is doing?
[18:27:22] <ferr> I understand what it does, but it still does not work as expected
[18:29:09] <ferr> I'm sorry, it's good
[18:29:24] <gambl0re> if i put jquery script inside head i dont neet to write $(document).ready() ?
[18:29:51] <taplar> you do if your doing dom lookups
[18:32:38] <taplar> jic, you can shorthand it with just $(function(){ ... })
[18:38:07] <gambl0re> i downloaded jquery src code...i put the file at the bottom of <body>. i put my own js file after jquery script.
[18:38:13] <gambl0re> thats all i have to do correct?
[18:38:23] <taplar> yep
[18:38:29] <gambl0re> its not working
[18:38:36] <taplar> any console errors?
[18:38:38] <gambl0re> im trying to do a simple click function and its not working
[18:38:59] <gambl0re> no
[18:39:09] <taplar> throw what your trying to do in a fiddle
[18:40:09] <gambl0re> oh nevermind. i was doing $(document).ready(){}
[18:40:16] <taplar> :)
[18:40:32] <gambl0re> havent used jquery in a while..
[18:41:05] <taplar> if your script is at the bottom of the page, you don't need that fwiw
[18:41:30] <gambl0re> i dont need it if its inside the body?
[18:41:54] <gambl0re> i thought you didnt need it if you put the script inside the head
[18:42:08] <taplar> doc ready delays the execution of the script until the html document has been parsed into the dom.  if your script is at the bottom of the body, all the previous html is already parsed into the dom so it doesn't serve any purpose
[18:42:18] <taplar> you do need it if the script is in the head
[18:43:01] <gambl0re> ok
[18:47:25] <billj5> is there anything similar to the x(?=y) regex assertion but that works with something that preceeds the desired match?
[18:48:57] <snover> billj5: what are you actually trying to do
[18:49:51] <billj5> i have "foo test bar"  i want to extract test, if it is preceeded by foo and is proceeded by bar
[18:50:52] <gambl0re> if im using .toggleclass, do i have to somehow import my css file?
[18:51:01] <gambl0re> how does jquery know how to retrieve classses?
[18:51:13] <taplar> gambl0re: it doesn't.  classes are not directly tied to css
[18:51:22] <taplar> you can have classes without css definitions
[18:52:28] <taplar> it's your browser that figures out which css definitions to apply against an element when it decides to redraw the page
[18:52:35] <taplar> outside of javascript
[18:55:07] <snover> billj5: so you want /foo (\w+) bar/.exec(string)[1] ???
[18:59:15] <taplar> gambl0re: if you want to see how jQuery checks the underlying dom element to see if it has a class or not, you can look at the source: http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.fn.hasClass
[18:59:53] <billj5> snover: that might work, i will try it out, thank you
[19:00:13] <taplar> i'm heading home peeps.  later.
[21:02:44] <billj5> https://jsfiddle.net/ye22ohaL/   how do i extract the <h1> in this example?
[21:06:53] <billj5> nevermind
