[00:56:42] <printForever> I'm running some code in the console
[00:56:47] <printForever> but I'm getting $ undefined
[00:56:58] <printForever> however, when I type jQuery it returns function a,b
[00:57:04] <printForever> so jQuery is loaded
[00:57:13] <printForever> $("#banners").offset().top; returns error
[01:06:48] <Activia> why is selected="selected" being renderd as selected&#x3d;&quot;selected&quot;
[01:07:08] <printForever> Activia, escape the quotes
[01:07:44] <jak2000> when i create a input box with an ajax call, how to assign a event? or call an event?

[02:17:36] <manus> Hello! Anyone awake? I basically want to re-ask my question from yesterday before filing a bug: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20160704.log.html#t12:44:19
[03:05:19] <Cork> manus: generate a jsfiddle showing the problem
[03:05:31] <Cork> it might depend on how it is executed
[03:44:04] <manus> Cork, no need for a jsFiddle, you can see it live on https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[04:02:09] <Cork> manus: where is the .focus() line you have problem with then?
[04:02:37] <RoabT> If you want to query the style on a page, I'm seeing suggestions to do something like `$('<tag class="class"></tag>').hide().css("color")`
[04:02:52] <RoabT> is it necessary to remove the element there when you're done?
[04:03:13] <Cork> RoabT: that won't work
[04:03:37] <Cork> 1. it sets display: none; so styling isn't happening, 2. it isn't connecting it with the page so stylesheets doesn't applay
[04:04:08] <Cork> RoabT: you need to insert the element in a place where the rule you want to check matches
[04:04:32] <Cork> RoabT: alternatively you can use document.styleSheets and query the rule there
[04:04:48] <Cork> (i would prob recommend the later)
[04:04:58] <RoabT> I read the 2nd method is not as reliable in terms of browser compatibility?
[04:06:04] <RoabT> Don't you also have to supply the exact style the css defines?
[04:06:27] <Cork> you need to provide the exact rule, not style
[04:06:38] <Cork> but the same is true if you create an element and inject that
[04:06:44] <Cork> you have to inject it at the correct place
[04:06:51] <Cork> else you don't know what data you get
[04:07:22] <Cork> and about document.styleSheats sure, it demands "modern" browsers
[04:07:25] <Cork> so ie6 won't work
[04:07:43] <Cork> (the browser has to support dom2)
[04:08:13] <Cork> that spec is just 16 years old so... :D
[04:18:08] <RoabT> Cork: Not really happy with either solutions, they both seem hacky. Decided to go with just describing the styles in the backend, then they can be put in to the css and js files via variable interpolation (which I realise isn't available in all situations)
[04:18:38] <Cork> RoabT: or you could actually explain what you're trying to do
[04:18:50] <Cork> and a better solution could be constructed
[04:20:57] <RoabT> Fade between 2 colours of a class, originally I was using jQuery UI, but thought a straight up jQuery solution would be better since we're not using any other jQuery UI features.
[04:21:15] <Cork> RoabT: what is the browser requirements?
[04:21:44] <RoabT> Not set in stone, but I generally think we're working to IE9 or IE10
[04:22:28] <Cork> hmm ie9 makes it slightly worse, but ie10 has css3 transition
[04:22:33] <Cork> so you could do it in pure css
[04:22:58] <Cork> also when you are animating an element you could ask for the color from that element
[04:23:10] <Cork> then you don't need the hackery you talked about
[04:24:28] <Cork> also you might want to have a look at http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/jquery.animate-colors.js
[04:24:34] <Cork> it make color animation work without ui
[04:25:03] <Cork> but ya, i would prob just go with straight css3 transition
[04:31:54] <RoabT> Thanks for the help Cork but the variable interpolation stuff better suits our system. Want to avoid tacking on more JS
[04:32:38] <Cork> RoabT: then why don't you just do $(this).css('color') when you start animating the element?
[04:33:23] <RoabT> The color being transitioned to is determined by the class
[04:34:48] <Cork> so just do var endColor = $(this).addClass('the-class').css('color'); $(this).removeClass('the-class');
[04:35:20] <Cork> then you can just store that value while doing the animation so you don't have to do that every time
[04:35:27] <Cork> and reset it when the animation is done
[04:36:17] <wind85> hi everybody!
[04:45:58] <RoabT> Cork: You're right, that's a better solution, thanks
[04:57:06] <manus> Cork, sorry, just reconnected, read the logs--the `.focus()` is just something I hand executed in the browser's JS console
[04:57:27] <Cork> manus: so again, make a jsfiddle showing your problem
[05:03:53] <RoabT> @ Cork: Got it working, looks nice :)
[05:04:27] <viewty> Hi all. Can some one tell me the name of the plugin / 'feature' where if you have a fixed sidebar, when you scroll down the page it automatically highlights the current active section according to what you're looking at?
[05:04:59] <viewty> e.g. http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ when you scroll down 'quick start' changes to orange then 'features'
[05:07:47] <Cork> viewty: https://stanhub.com/sticky-header-change-navigation-active-class-on-page-scroll-with-jquery/
[05:10:30] <viewty> Thank you Cork
[05:13:35] <manus> Cork: uuggghh, ok, so it looks like it's doing something weird when the devtools are open, maybe because focus is returned to the devtools in between some weird event chain the datepicker does. It's fine when I use setTimeout and close the devtools, or when using just one .focus() in the jsFiddle. So this shouldn't really be an issue :) Thanks!
[05:19:43] <Cork> manus: and THIS is why i asked you to make a jsfiddle :)
[05:19:52] <Cork> to help yo solve your problem yourself
[05:20:54] <manus> Cork: you are a wise one ;)
[05:35:25] <naftilos76> Can i delete a ccs style property defined in a css stylesheet? Deleting inline style properties is pretty much straightforward by doing element.css('property', ''); However when it comes to a property defined in a stylesheet things are not that easy. Can anybody help?
[05:38:47] <Cork> naftilos76: you can modify a stylesheet but it isn't recommended
[05:39:06] <Cork> it forces the browser to reapply all the stylesheats again so it becomes heavy
[05:39:35] <Cork> naftilos76: the best option is to just add a separate class changing the style you want and apply that class when you want to remove/change the effect
[05:39:41] <Cork> much lighter in load
[05:39:47] <Cork> (and cleaner)
[05:40:00] <naftilos76> Cork, i am working on a web-based website builder so i have to find direct or indirect ways to make it happen
[05:40:45] <Cork> naftilos76: then you want to look into document.styleSheets
[05:40:52] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/styleSheets
[05:41:06] <naftilos76> Cork, thanks a lot
[06:27:01] <r3za> hi guys , i have a code like this one : https://jsfiddle.net/cxbk34k6/ , i want to know how can i check if the return of execute function in wrap is an error or 'Result'
[06:27:03] <r3za> ?
[06:37:14] <d8bhatta> Hello All
[06:38:18] <d8bhatta> Today I got to validate new master card number validation which work effectively from this sept. https://www.forte.net/blog/mastercard-bin-range-coming/
[06:39:02] <d8bhatta> Currently we have following code to validate master card num
[06:39:04] <d8bhatta> *    'MC': [new RegExp('^5[1-5][0-9]{14}$'), new RegExp('^[0-9]{3}$'), true],
[06:39:40] <d8bhatta> how the card numb is going to change can be read as following:
[06:39:43] <d8bhatta> MasterCard has announced that they will add a new 2 series BIN range effective October 2016. The BIN range (222100-272099) will be processed with and in the same manner as the existing 51-55 BIN range (510000-559999).
[06:40:05] <d8bhatta> I have following code to address the issue:
[06:40:18] <d8bhatta>   'MC': [new RegExp('^5[1-5][0-9]|2[2-7][0-9]{14}$'), new RegExp('^[0-9]{3}$'), true],
[06:40:26] <d8bhatta> but it doesn't work.
[06:40:40] <d8bhatta> any suggestions?
[06:49:49] <m1su> d8bhatta: ^(5[1-5]|2[2-7])[0-9]{14}$
[07:01:47] <yellowgum> hey guys
[07:02:04] <yellowgum> any docs on how to build an hls player from scratch?
[07:10:00] <yellowgum> anyone?
[07:58:04] <yellowgum> :|
[08:03:45] <RedNifre> If I do $.when(three ajax calls).done(...).fail(function() {...}), how can I figure out what the problem was when one of the ajax calls failed?
[08:08:05] <shoky> RedNifre: by checking the arguments to the fail callback. if you need to know which of the 3 failed you should probably add fail handlers to each of them
[08:16:23] <yellowgum> heey, anyone
[08:23:25] <RedNifre> shoky Ah, thanks, I missread the documentation and thought that fail takes a function with no arguments.
[08:23:54] <RedNifre> Currently I only want to distinguish between one special error and everything else.
[08:28:06] <Pazician> Why does my console.log return 8 instead of just one? It should return just one in the console.log since I'm using $this? https://pastee.org/w4rfu
[08:30:40] <shoky> Pazician: attr_id is a string with length 8 ;p
[08:31:15] <Pazician> shoky: what? It should return how many of the elements it finds
[08:31:31] <Pazician> oh
[08:31:32] <Pazician> omg
[08:32:07] <jose3_> Morning
[08:33:20] <yellowgum> :|
[08:46:31] <richardwhiuk> y/win 19
[08:51:07] <jose3_> I have a switch case that looks at time and determines a greeting. How could I simplify this ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4a22ffba4c775af79b961fadcec14736
[08:51:24] <jose3_> oops I meant to just give the link and not embed
[08:55:43] <Pazician> i'm pretty much stuck, how do I scroll to a class section? https://pastee.org/t4wkg
[09:07:13] <Cork> Pazician: grab the offset of the element you want to scroll to and use .animate({ scrollTop: })
[09:18:41] <yellowgum> > any docs on how to build an hls player from scratch?
[09:53:35] <jose3_> work time
[10:04:43] <pingo> Hey, when I do $("body").load("b.html"), how do I know the body has loaded and I can start running selectors on it?
[10:08:51] <Cork> pingo: there is a callback function you can give it as a second argument
[10:16:13] <pingo> Thank you
[10:22:11] <jak2000> hi all
[10:57:57] <JohnTortellini> to select a recurring element among siblings, do i do siblings().each ?
[11:08:57] <yellowgum> i am amazed by the fact that nobody gives a damn about my question
[11:09:24] <yellowgum> - irc channels in a nutshell
[11:09:50] <RedNifre> yellowgum a hls player? You mean like a dash player?
[11:10:38] <RedNifre> yellowgum don't fret, we love your question!
[11:11:23] <yellowgum_> whoops
[11:11:42] <yellowgum_> so yeah, a player that can play rtmp/hls/dash streams
[11:11:55] <prillian5> I have this to replace a class-attribute. :  replace('active itemId', 'Subnavi')
[11:12:35] <prillian5> is it possible to have an "OR" in the replace-String like: replace('[active|normal] itemId', 'Subnavi')
[11:12:37] <prillian5> S
[11:13:34] <prillian5> means if the attribute is "active itemID" OR "normal itemId" it should be replaced
[11:17:38] <YouNixcc> I was wondering if jquery selectable and draggable conflict together.. so lets say we have got a table where jquery selectable is applied and the <tr>s are being selected with the mouse, however this <tr>s can be dragged using jquery draggable... any idea how to solve this ?
[11:31:25] <joaocastanho> hi
[12:00:22] <Gsham> hey anyone here?
[12:00:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> about 580 people are :)
[12:00:52] <Gsham> :)
[12:01:09] <Gsham> if im making an event with on('click') and to shut it off i made another event on the document should the second event be with one or on
[12:01:14] <Gsham> one('click')...
[12:01:29] <Gsham> meaning the shut off event keeps getting created only when its been turned on
[12:05:45] <ironcamel> i'm running into something really weird. document.getElementById('radio-done-2.1.3') returns the element I expect, but $('#radio-done-2.1.3') returns nothing. what am i doing wrong?
[12:06:09] <robertmaxrees> Gsham so first off you're not "making an event"
[12:06:22] <robertmaxrees> ironcamel the periods.
[12:06:40] <Gsham> what am i doing?
[12:06:58] <ironcamel> robertmaxrees: do i need to escape them ?
[12:07:04] <robertmaxrees> ironcamel yep.
[12:07:36] <robertmaxrees> ircnode0 otherwise the jquery selector engine things you're looking for an element with ID radio-done-2 and the classes 1 and 3
[12:07:40] <robertmaxrees> err, ironcamel
[12:07:44] <ironcamel> oh, heh
[12:07:49] <robertmaxrees> Gsham you're binding a listener.  second off - why do you think you need to shut off that listener?
[12:07:52] <ironcamel> so is it bad practice to put periods in ids?
[12:08:16] <robertmaxrees> ironcamel yep, because period normally denotes a class.
[12:08:26] <ironcamel> makes sense. thanks robertmaxrees ++
[12:08:29] <Gsham> i figured if i have an event bound to the document its not good? so i have it only turn on when the object is clicke
[12:08:45] <Gsham> so you can now turn off the modal when clicking anywhere else
[12:08:51] <ironcamel> robertmaxrees++
[12:09:04] <robertmaxrees> Gsham aaaah - so it's for a modal.  do you have an overlay on the page?
[12:09:27] <Gsham> nah im just using the basic example... lo
[12:09:31] <Gsham> its a little dropdown
[12:09:32] <robertmaxrees> "the basic example"
[12:09:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:09:36] <Gsham> you click it and it opens
[12:09:43] <Gsham> and then if you click elsewhere it closes
[12:10:27] <robertmaxrees> so is this a modal or a dropdown?
[12:10:50] <Gsham> lol. its a dropdown. not a select item but a dropdown of li's
[12:11:02] <Gsham> so you rpess a button and the dropdown opens
[12:11:07] <Gsham> and if you click elsewhere it closes
[12:11:17] <robertmaxrees> okay.  no need to unbind your listener.  just check inside the handler to see if it's open and, if so, close it.
[12:11:17] <Gsham> is it better to use one or on
[12:11:21] <Gsham> for the close event
[12:11:23] <robertmaxrees> on.
[12:11:28] <Gsham> ok
[12:11:29] <Gsham> thanks
[12:11:40] <robertmaxrees> i suggest people avoid bindings as much as possible.
[12:11:53] <Gsham> https://www.dropbox.com/s/xkjeqrjbmy86c4m/Screenshot%202016-07-05%2012.11.40.png?dl=0
[12:12:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:12:10] <robertmaxrees> post code, not screenshots of code.
[12:12:26] <Gsham> lol. im a front end developer... its what im used to
[12:12:32] <robertmaxrees> i am, too.
[12:12:39] <robertmaxrees> a frontend developer i mean.
[12:12:48] <robertmaxrees> screenshots of code are still weird heh.
[12:14:17] <Gsham> it was faster than opening codebin
[12:14:35] <Gsham> but yeah i guess it was helpless
[12:14:37] <robertmaxrees> lol it's easier for other folks to digest if you just share the actual code, but =alright.
[12:14:38] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:15:21] <Ales> hey, i store some data in array (php), and i call json convert it's good however when i try to move my js to other file it won't recognize php variable
[12:15:40] <robertmaxrees> Ales JS doesn't read PHP.
[12:15:44] <Ales> json
[12:16:15] <robertmaxrees> so "it won't recognize php variable" is kind of odd.  mind clarifying what you mean by "i try to move my js to other file"?
[12:23:22] <robertmaxrees> Well that was fun.
[12:23:42] <fission6> how do i trigger / fire a native change event through jquery?
[12:23:58] <robertmaxrees> fission6 you can't.  jquery events and native DOM events are two different things.
[12:24:09] <fission6> how do i fire a native dom even then
[12:24:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events
[12:34:28] <Ales> robertmaxrees, external js file
[12:34:53] <Ales> if jquery script is in same as php it's ok, but if i put in external it won't recognize php array
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> so it's not reading php.
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> eber.
[12:38:12] <robertmaxrees> *ever.  JS and PHP execute in two different places.  the issue is that you're moving stuff generating JSON to a non php file.
[12:39:01] <Ales> robertmaxrees  i doubt that
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean you're moving just the stuff trying to read the generated JSON to another location in which case you're probably loading your JS before the json exists.
[12:39:29] <robertmaxrees> but I'd have to see the page to really know.
[12:40:22] <Ales> have tw?
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:40:27] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need it.
[12:40:54] <robertmaxrees> is your JS file included after the place you generate the JSON on the page?
[12:41:19] <Ales> ill give u js file sec
[12:41:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:42:14] <Ales> robertmaxrees, https://gyazo.com/c3b03d12415f1bb52b219a5b8dacc0a5
[12:42:49] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:42:57] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, i was right.
[12:43:13] <robertmaxrees> exchange = JSON.parse();
[12:43:15] <Ales> yeh how to load from external :) ?
[12:43:16] <abyx> Any idea why my date picker isn't highlighting "today"?
[12:43:31] <Ales> cuz apocalypse abyx
[12:43:35] <robertmaxrees> Ales gotta give it a URL or something.
[12:43:44] <robertmaxrees> abyx missing css?  bad config?
[12:43:48] <Ales> :)
[12:44:02] <robertmaxrees> Ales that's what I'd do - make an endpoint for it.
[12:44:24] <Ales> robertmaxrees, problem is i call variable that is in diferent php file
[12:44:31] <Ales> can i use include 'phpfile.php'
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> Ales .js files and .php files have totally different rules.
[12:44:50] <robertmaxrees> make an endpoint for you to hit via ajax.
[12:45:31] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll need to generate the JSOn on pageload and stick it somewhere on the page under a globally available namespace.
[12:45:53] <Ales> robertmaxrees, i will start using ajax by end of this week or next week.
[12:46:20] <robertmaxrees> Ales 'kay.  you have a few different options.  Those will both be good options, depending on whatever you're building.
[12:46:25] <Ales> ajax
[12:46:27] <Ales> ofc..
[12:46:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just stick the JSON on the page.
[12:47:00] <Ales> $.ajax
[12:47:41] <Ales> robertmaxrees, where to use it excatly?
[12:48:15] <robertmaxrees> you'll create an endpoint in your application that serves up just the rendered JSON and then you'd use ajax to fetch the data from that URL.
[12:49:23] <Ales> so after variable defining in js robertmaxrees ?
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:00:24] <Ales> robertmaxrees,  ?
[13:00:32] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[13:00:42] <Ales> it's better to highlight after you talk to someone
[13:00:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:01:13] <Ales> Where should i use ajax robertmaxrees
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> you'd rebuild that whole file.
[13:01:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of setting a var to the encoded json, you'd use ajax to fetch it from a URL.
[13:02:03] <Ales> alright, then i wouldn't need json?
[13:02:09] <robertmaxrees> you would.
[13:02:32] <robertmaxrees> but if you do it right from your server-side, you wouldn't need to use the utilites on the JSON object in JS.
[13:02:59] <Ales> ahh. I see i will check some tuts later though
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:03:13] <Ales> for now i will just use it in 1 file
[13:04:47] <robertmaxrees> why not just stick the data on a globally available var?
[13:12:16] <Ales> robertmaxrees, i would still need to link other file wouldn't i?
[13:12:36] <robertmaxrees> if you put the data in a globally available var, you can then just read that var.
[13:12:47] <Ales> need to do it in js?
[13:12:54] <robertmaxrees> Do what in JS?
[13:13:16] <Ales> $var exchange = <?php echo json_encode($phparray)?>
[13:13:34] <robertmaxrees> that looks like PHP to me.
[13:13:43] <Ales> sorry just var exchange
[13:13:45] <Ales> not $
[13:14:04] <Ales> robertmaxrees, you confused me
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like window.exchangeData = <?php echo json_encode($phparray)?> to make it clear.
[13:14:23] <robertmaxrees> then you can just read window,exchangeData wherever you need it.
[14:26:02] <robertmaxrees> sooo tired today.  got woken up way too early today.
[14:38:06] <adamsilver> Is jquery UI compatible with jQuery 3?
[14:39:22] <robertmaxrees> per http://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/ (section titled "Compatibility with jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile"), mostly.  they both have some changes to make that'll fix some some issues.  the jq migrate 3.0 plugin should fix things in the meantime.,
[14:47:17] <adamsilver> that's a little depressing, I was thinking about starting a new project using jq3 and jq ui
[14:47:46] <robertmaxrees> they're working on updating jqui.  there are some other big things being worked on for jqui so i wouldn't be too bummed about it.
[14:54:43] <jak2000> i have a table with 1000 rows, how to block the Head? if user move(scroll down) the head/titles not move, thanks
[14:55:04] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you mean you want the headings to be fixed?
[14:55:38] <overtime>  /j #express
[14:55:47] <jak2000> yes
[14:56:00] <jak2000> robert i fixed my last prroblem with: async:false    :)
[14:56:10] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 don't use async:false;
[14:56:13] <robertmaxrees> that's a really really bad idea,.
[14:56:24] <jak2000> then?
[14:56:35] <jak2000> recommend please me other way
[14:56:36] <robertmaxrees> huh
[14:56:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:56:42] <jak2000> and why is bad idea?
[14:56:47] <robertmaxrees> you're locking the browser.
[14:57:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not good.  and i don't really remember what you were trying to do but i do remember you were getting tripped up on how to use callbacks.
[14:57:23] <robertmaxrees> and here's one of dozens of ways to do fixed table headings: https://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/
[14:58:18] <jak2000> ok
[14:58:19] <jak2000> thx
[14:58:31] <robertmaxrees> and you should read up on callbacks and/or deferreds.
[14:59:17] <robertmaxrees> because what little i recall about your problem was that it really had to do with some janky callback setup where you were worried about the order callbacks were executing and it was really strange.
[14:59:56] <jak2000> i have somecicles :for .... remember?
[15:00:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:00:08] <robertmaxrees> "somecicles"?
[15:00:38] <jak2000> some cicles with for
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> still lost.  what's a "cicle"?  do you mean your for loops?
[15:01:10] <jak2000> loop :)
[15:01:21] <robertmaxrees> oh - "cycle", and doesn't really matter.
[15:02:21] <jak2000> simply: for (var i=1;i<10;i( insert data.....   in the table i see the insertion: 7,4,1,8,5,3,9,2,6
[15:02:36] <jak2000> and i want the isnertion: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
[15:02:56] <robertmaxrees> right, you were relying on the order of ajax calls finishing, which is not a good idea.
[15:03:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to come up with some other way to match a call up with the cell it was for.
[15:03:22] <robertmaxrees> also weren't you doing one call for each field?
[15:03:28] <jak2000> yes
[15:03:32] <jak2000> yes
[15:03:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah that was a bad idea.
[15:03:38] <jak2000> sorry for double: yes
[15:03:52] <jak2000> why?
[15:04:07] <robertmaxrees> you're incurring tons of networking overhead for each change.
[15:04:11] <robertmaxrees> why not just do each row?
[15:04:43] <jak2000> is possible: better, all the table?
[15:04:46] <robertmaxrees> or the whole table?
[15:05:03] <jak2000> yes
[15:05:15] <jak2000> how to send to an ajax callback?
[15:05:36] <robertmaxrees> by using .then() or .done()
[15:06:02] <robertmaxrees> you're already using callbacks fwiw.
[15:06:17] <robertmaxrees> you're just confused about how they work.
[15:06:45] <jak2000> yes a little
[15:07:34] <robertmaxrees> right.  either way, the "Smart" way to do this is to do one request per row or just do the whole table.
[15:07:52] <jak2000> ok understand and try :)
[15:07:52] <jak2000> thanks
[16:57:33] <coderfromcincy> anyone here ever integrated a wordpress blog into a non wordpress website?
[16:59:24] <robertmaxrees> what's there to integrate?
[16:59:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:00:15] <coderfromcincy> considering you're just installing WP in a subdirectory on your server, i would say there is plenty to integrate...
[17:00:36] <robertmaxrees> Could you be more specific about what you're trying to accomplish?
[17:00:39] <coderfromcincy> i am sick of using google blogger and it seems like WP blog is a better solution..
[17:01:01] <coderfromcincy> if you have better solutions for adding a blog to a custom site I'm all ears..
[17:01:18] <robertmaxrees> lots of people would stick the blog on a subdomain and leave the rest of the site alone.  other folks might use WP as a full CMS to run everything and pop all content into it.
[17:01:42] <robertmaxrees> still others might just route particular URLs to go to the WP stuff and the rest of it back to the main site.
[17:02:28] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other cms/blogging platform: they all have their ups and downs.
[17:05:59] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy sounds like from your PM that you want to use WP as more of a CMS.
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> when you said "I'm just wanting to make sure I am not constantly involved when they are wanting to add new content" then that's realy the transition you want to me.
[17:06:38] <robertmaxrees> *make
[17:07:28] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy "i dont want to just move fully to a WP site because its too limiting for me but I obviously just want to utilize the CMS power" - it sounds like there'll be some custom pages peppered in there.
[17:08:07] <coderfromcincy> yeah i have server side pages for staff management
[17:08:14] <coderfromcincy> and im not using php
[17:08:28] <robertmaxrees> but generally project like this benefit from having a general CMS in there.  Lots of different options available to you.  If you wanted something a little more flexible, Django is a pretty popular choice.
[17:08:47] <robertmaxrees> *projects
[17:09:39] <joj> I have a newbie question, and I'm having a hard time figuring out what to Google. Basically I would like to have a list of <input type="text /> and <button> pairs where clicking on the button triggers the .select() function for the corresponding <input>. I'm having trouble figuring out how to say the first button should trigger the first input, second button second input and so on.
[17:09:56] <coderfromcincy> as long as Django will run on a windows server its an option..
[17:10:25] <coderfromcincy> joj please provide a jsfiddle or jsbin example
[17:10:26] <robertmaxrees> coderfromcincy it's a python project.  i might take a look, though it'll require a nearly ground-up build, it does some cool bootstrapping for you.
[17:10:42] <joj> The list will have a variable number of <input>, <button> pairs and more can be added
[17:10:44] <robertmaxrees> joj you should structure your markup so each "pair" is grouped.
[17:10:58] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i might logically group each into a form, depending.
[17:11:15] <joj> ok I'll go do a jsfiddle
[17:11:17] <coderfromcincy> joj you could also use index if you wanted
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> eh, i'd avoid ephemeral relationships in a case like this.
[17:11:37] <joj> ooh I see. I'll come back with some specific code :)
[17:11:40] <robertmaxrees> it'd be much easier to just .closest().find()
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> joj figure it out?  or still working on a fiddle?
[17:21:30] <joj> robertmaxrees still working on the fiddle. I'm pretty new to js and i haven't used jsfiddle before. Sorry for the wait.
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> just checking to make sure :) we don't need more than a basic test case.  so don't worry about recreating your whole page.
[17:23:55] <joj> Ok here it is: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Vbu3wtl8BL
[17:24:25] <robertmaxrees> heh interesting.
[17:24:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c1xe02o9/
[17:25:09] <robertmaxrees> actually https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c1xe02o9/1/
[17:25:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to rely on the coercion of just appending an array. and this is a classic use case for a .map() :)  SO!  you want to get the corresponding input when you click on a button, yeah?
[17:26:32] <joj> yes I'd like that clicking on a Rename button will do a .select on the corresponding (same line) <input type="text" />
[17:26:56] <coderfromcincy> .select?
[17:27:00] <robertmaxrees> err, "will do a .select()" meaning you want to trigger that event?
[17:27:13] <joj> yes trigger the event
[17:27:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c1xe02o9/3/
[17:28:10] <robertmaxrees> you can use .trigger() to trigger the event, though I'd ask why not just call the function you care about specifically and call it a day.
[17:31:10] <joj> robertmaxrees oh wow, that's a lot simpler than I thought. Didn't know about closest().
[17:31:33] <joj> That should do it. And yes, I can just directly call the function.
[17:31:35] <coderfromcincy> closest is one of my favorite jquery methods..
[17:31:44] <coderfromcincy> besides each lol
[17:31:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it starts and the current element and looks at every ancestor until it matches your selector and stops.
[17:31:53] <joj> Thanks everyone :D
[17:31:54] <robertmaxrees> i actually hardly use each these days tbh.
[17:32:57] <coderfromcincy> if you use each with a (k,v) paramater, you can control delays and all kinds of fun stuff..
[17:33:24] <robertmaxrees> "k,v"?  the args are index and element.
[17:33:34] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean $.each and not $.fn.each
[17:34:21] <coderfromcincy> yeah those are just my go to variables lol
[17:34:48] <robertmaxrees> i tend to avoid iterating and enumerating these days, too now that I think about it.
[17:35:08] <coderfromcincy> if you are parsing json results, its helpful imo
[17:35:36] <robertmaxrees> howso?  shouldn't need to concern yourself much with keynames except in your templates.
[17:36:01] <coderfromcincy> i use alot of apis
[17:36:39] <robertmaxrees> so do I.  hard to think of a case where we wouldn't just use an array and .map() or whatever to get what we need.
[17:36:43] <coderfromcincy> each just makes it easier to traverse them
[17:36:59] <coderfromcincy> as i said.. in my opinion.. you obviously like using .map
[17:37:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying i generally don't need to enuemerate over objects and have a hard time seeing a case where I'd be doing it a lot.
[17:37:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:37:17] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[17:38:13] <coderfromcincy> if you have to parse json and pull in specific properties of articles, events, that is a reason to use enumeration
[17:38:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it :)
[17:38:41] <coderfromcincy> sometimes APIs dont give you back filtered results, you have to clean up the garbage
[17:39:16] <coderfromcincy> go to any site that uses google blogger, google calender, or google drive APIs.. i'm sure they are there
[17:39:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a prime candidate for using .map(), .some(), .every(), etc.
[17:40:12] <coderfromcincy> lol.. #HillaryOrTrump - #.Map()or.Each() who will win... who freaking knows..
[17:40:52] <robertmaxrees> actually, i've been hearing more and more arguments about who's going to win that, but i'ma keep quiet since that discussion REALLY qickly devolves into namecalling and frustration.
[17:46:53] <coderfromcincy> robert you are very right sir, nobody can like one and not hate the other it seems..
[17:48:00] <robertmaxrees> eh, less about that and more about the inability to talk about politics this year without very quick going into ad hominem territory, even with the people they're talking with.
[17:52:51] <coderfromcincy> when you depth of knowledge in a particular subject is as shallow as a baby pool, it is always easier to attack someone on a personal level to throw off the people who actually care about the substance of the conversation..
[17:53:06] <coderfromcincy> your^
[17:54:10] <robertmaxrees> heh, even people that I know to be relatively intelligent.  I think it's that we're finally at a point where people are getting involved, which is awesome!  The downside is that they aren't willing to have rational conversations and reason about the bigger picture.
[17:55:33] <coderfromcincy> i personally cannot wait until the first debate..
[17:55:56] <robertmaxrees> it'll be interesting to watch.
[17:56:15] <arc_> most people aren't used to such things. it wasn't until relatively recently that most people's opinions on policy didn't matter in the slightest outside of the voting booth
[17:56:27] <coderfromcincy> i hope Megyn kelly moderates
[17:56:33] <robertmaxrees> arc_ exactly.  people didn't involve themselves.  suddenly, they did!
[17:56:38] <arc_> the concept of people writing out their opinions and putting them in a public place for other people to read was basically just invented
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:57:17] <arc_> prior to facebook, the incidence of most adult human beings writing a full paragraph for any reason was almost nil
[17:57:26] <arc_> now everyone does
[17:57:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue against that sentiment.
[17:57:42] <arc_> well i'm exaggerating obviously but
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> the distinction is that people do so much more frequently.
[17:58:14] <coderfromcincy> I honestly never saw facebook become a battleground until the same-sex marriage federal rulings
[17:58:30] <coderfromcincy> it was like a war broke out at the skittles factory :)
[17:58:30] <arc_> there are lots of people for whom if you asked them 'when is the last time you wrote down more than a few sentences' the answer would be in high school
[17:58:30] <robertmaxrees> i saw it during the last two election cycles.
[17:58:46] <robertmaxrees> arc_ sure, but they also probably communicate at higher frequency than they used to.
[17:59:04] <arc_> now they certainly do
[17:59:13] <robertmaxrees> right, and they write fewer words.
[17:59:22] <robertmaxrees> frequency vs. bandwidth.
[17:59:23] <coderfromcincy> that's snapchats fault
[17:59:27] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:59:28] <robertmaxrees> that's natural.
[17:59:29] <coderfromcincy> lol
[17:59:30] <coderfromcincy> jk
[17:59:38] <robertmaxrees> we used to write longform because we had such low frequency.
[17:59:57] <robertmaxrees> now we can write much more frequently, so we tend to write less.
[17:59:58] <coderfromcincy> well twitter put that shit to rest
[18:00:07] <coderfromcincy> anything you want to say as long as its less than 140 characters
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> that's changing soon, too ;)
[18:00:21] <arc_> is it?
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.  they're upping the limit.
[18:00:30] <coderfromcincy> now its going to be a max of 3 emojis with 2 letters?
[18:00:33] <arc_> when?
[18:00:37] <robertmaxrees> to like 10,000 chars.
[18:00:41] <arc_> i heard they were considering it but they hadn't decided yet
[18:01:04] <coderfromcincy> well that's going to fucking suck.. now i gotta change my custom twitter widgets..
[18:01:07] <arc_> good riddance to jpeg screenshots of text
[18:01:10] <coderfromcincy> let me know when :D
[18:01:21] <robertmaxrees> i haven't heard any dates, but Dorsey was looking to do it.
[18:01:25] <robertmaxrees> not an "if" but a "when.
[18:01:43] <coderfromcincy> that will be the end of twitter
[18:01:47] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> i doubt it.  their adoption rate plummeting it the real issue.
[18:02:03] <arc_> most tweets will still be short
[18:02:04] <robertmaxrees> they need to gain more audience.
[18:02:08] <arc_> and he's gone
[18:02:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:03:50] <arc_> the other thing is this concept that every opinion automatically has value because it's an opinion
[18:04:18] <arc_> we shouldn't have to equally consider every single thing that any person says
[18:04:29] <robertmaxrees> sure, but that's how democracies and republics work.
[18:04:44] <robertmaxrees> anybody can say what they like.  it's up to the listener to choose to consume that or not.
[18:04:56] <arc_> the second thing is what i'm talking about
[18:05:06] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:05:17] <arc_> people now think that they have to be listened to
[18:05:52] <robertmaxrees> really?  becuase that's not the issue I see at all.
[18:06:21] <arc_> howso
[18:07:12] <robertmaxrees> more often than not i see that people are dismissive and love getting in the last word without listening to anybody else.  which is fine - that's their perogative.  but don't be surprised when somebody thinks you're an asshole for doing that.
[18:09:20] <arc_> i don't think that's necessarily at odds with what i said
[18:09:25] <arc_> both of those things are true
[18:09:53] <robertmaxrees> i look at it from a slightly different perspective and context i guess.
[18:11:35] <printForever> I'm looking into comparing two arrays
[18:11:46] <printForever> but all the info I'm getting online is confusing to me
[18:12:07] <robertmaxrees> printForever mind clarifying what you mean by "comparing two arrays"?
[18:12:19] <printForever> hi robertmaxrees
[18:12:35] <printForever> I got two arrays of strings (one word per index)
[18:12:52] <printForever> problem is, I got few of the same words in both arrays
[18:13:05] <printForever> I would like to show (use) only the difference
[18:13:29] <robertmaxrees> so you want to make a new array with all identical words removed?
[18:13:57] <robertmaxrees> that's a quick .filter() operation.
[18:14:49] <arc_> sounds like he probably wants to remove duplicates from one array but leave the arrays separate, otherwise i'm not sure why he has two arrays to begin with
[18:14:58] <robertmaxrees> i'
[18:15:21] <robertmaxrees> *i'd make a new array without modifying the originals since mutating data is something to avoid.
[18:15:27] <arc_> true
[18:16:25] <printForever> yes
[18:16:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then just use .filter()
[18:16:53] <printForever> arc_ is correct
[18:17:05] <printForever> can I get a basic example or an idea how to use it?
[18:17:05] <robertmaxrees> eh, any reason you can't make a new array?
[18:17:14] <printForever> I can make a new array
[18:17:18] <printForever> I already did
[18:17:31] <printForever> I just dont know how to fill it with diff index sting values
[18:17:39] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:19:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xup6uxz/
[18:19:48] <arc_> o_O lol
[18:19:58] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:20:03] <arc_> sounds like i wasn't correct but w/e i guess
[18:20:24] <printForever> let me see
[18:20:32] <printForever> I started building my own
[18:22:29] <printForever> robertmaxrees: can you please explain to me the -1 in line 4?
[18:22:37] <robertmaxrees> it's indexOf
[18:22:46] <robertmaxrees> it returns -1 if something isn't in an array.
[18:23:07] <printForever> but... it could also, for example, return 555?
[18:23:22] <robertmaxrees> if it IS in that other array, then yes.
[18:23:28] <printForever> I know that indexes start from 0 to n-1
[18:23:44] <robertmaxrees> right.  -1 is returned if something isn't in the array.
[18:23:50] <printForever> got it
[18:23:59] <printForever> and thats an internal syntax rule?
[18:24:07] <robertmaxrees> "an internal syntax rule"...?
[18:24:20] <printForever> "thats how it is, learn it as is"
[18:24:24] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[18:24:31] <robertmaxrees> "The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present."
[18:24:34] <robertmaxrees> that's the spec for the method.
[18:24:47] <printForever> got it...
[18:24:53] <printForever> its built inside the method
[18:25:13] <printForever> if they built 999 then it would return 999 if the element is not in the array
[18:25:32] <robertmaxrees> who is "they"?
[18:25:48] <printForever> you're just filtering arrayOne for each index, then comapring it with the index of arrayTwo and checking to see if its equal to /1
[18:25:50] <printForever> -1
[18:25:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:25:58] <printForever> "they" W3C I guess
[18:26:06] <robertmaxrees> w3c doesn't define the spec for JS.
[18:26:08] <robertmaxrees> ecma does.
[18:26:17] <printForever> there we go... those guys are they :)
[18:26:20] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean "they could've chosen any number, but they chose -1"?
[18:26:24] <printForever> yes
[18:26:32] <robertmaxrees> because in that case, not really.  that would limit the amount of stuff you can have in an array.
[18:26:40] <printForever> thats what I thought
[18:26:44] <robertmaxrees> which is currently limited to a very big number, but that could change in the future.
[18:26:45] <printForever> and thats why I asked
[18:26:56] <printForever> because there could be an index with 555 or 999
[18:27:13] <robertmaxrees> so you'd use -1 to fulfill the contract that the method returns a number always AND to signal that the thing doesn't exist in the array.
[18:27:20] <printForever> so -1 is the safest bet, because indexes start from 0
[18:27:25] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:27:37] <printForever> or... they could have used -999 :)
[18:27:45] <printForever> anything that is -
[18:27:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:27:58] <printForever> :(
[18:28:00] <robertmaxrees> that implies that you could have an array with negative indices.
[18:28:14] <printForever> you cant have that, riiight?
[18:28:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:28:23] <robertmaxrees> hence you just use -1 from indexOf()
[18:28:26] <printForever> right
[18:28:33] <robertmaxrees> shit brb
[18:28:34] <printForever> thank you robertmaxrees! :)
[19:04:30] <printForever> I wanted to merge two values from an index from an array together
[19:04:36] <printForever> I wrote an each
[19:04:44] <robertmaxrees> merge how?
[19:04:53] <printForever> I used name.value and name.value2
[19:05:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused, but OK.
[19:05:13] <printForever> and then I returned name.value + name.value2
[19:05:16] <printForever> to get a new array
[19:05:18] <printForever> with just strings
[19:05:24] <robertmaxrees> arrays don't have names.
[19:05:26] <printForever> of those two values merged
[19:05:32] <printForever> they have indexes
[19:05:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what you did :)
[19:05:36] <robertmaxrees> but i'll believe you.
[19:05:38] <printForever> but its a property of an index
[19:05:40] <printForever> ok
[19:06:25] <printForever> http://goo.gl/tm6oWO
[19:06:40] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.  i'm a little nervous clicking on a shortened URL at work heh
[19:06:47] <printForever> its pastebin
[19:06:52] <robertmaxrees> seen too many people get trolled with that one.
[19:07:01] <printForever> trust me
[19:07:03] <printForever> its fine
[19:07:07] <robertmaxrees> mind sending the actual URL then?
[19:07:15] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/AhfZuhXH
[19:07:53] <printForever> I'm guessing I screwed up with indexes in line 3 and 4
[19:07:58] <robertmaxrees> so it's an array of objects.
[19:08:03] <printForever> yes
[19:08:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so is something not working like you'd expect?
[19:08:30] <printForever> I wanted to merge two values from an object
[19:08:34] <printForever> and create a new array of object
[19:08:37] <printForever> and create a new array of objects
[19:08:50] <printForever> that contain the merged values from the object
[19:09:02] <printForever> name . extension
[19:09:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i would've use a .map() and a .filter(), but OK :)
[19:09:17] <printForever> I'm novice
[19:09:18] <robertmaxrees> or vice versa, depending.
[19:09:20] <printForever> extreme novice
[19:09:33] <printForever> so... where did I go wrong
[19:09:41] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't say you're an extreme novice.  you've been kicking around on freenode for a year or so, yeah?
[19:10:01] <printForever> because the var on line 2 returns an array of objects as I never changed a thing
[19:10:12] <robertmaxrees> Could you share a fiddle with sample data?
[19:10:23] <printForever> I've learned how to ask question :D
[19:10:25] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you might be incorrectly reading your data.
[19:10:33] <printForever> its basically a domain name split into two
[19:10:39] <printForever> domain and com
[19:10:43] <printForever> and I want to make it domain.com
[19:10:54] <robertmaxrees> great!  a fiddle with examples would be really helpful here.
[19:11:04] <printForever> I've checked 7 times, I'm reading the data correctly
[19:11:17] <robertmaxrees> okay.  i'd love to be able to review your logic against that data.
[19:11:43] <robertmaxrees> so a fiddle would be really helpful.  since you already have the code and the data, should be pretty easy for you to put together so I don't have to reverse engineer examples.
[19:11:47] <printForever> question: Do I need to explicitly provide the index for the array object?
[19:12:02] <printForever> because I thought that in .each() the index is assigned
[19:12:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what that's supposed to me.
[19:12:25] <robertmaxrees> *mean
[19:12:28] <printForever> and on line 3 it should grab index 0 and get values from that
[19:12:43] <printForever> and so on, until he goes through all of them
[19:12:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:12:54] <printForever> increasing the index value +1
[19:12:59] <printForever> line 3
[19:13:04] <robertmaxrees> the index has nothing to do with line 3.
[19:13:07] <printForever> do I need to write value.index.domain?
[19:13:12] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[19:13:21] <printForever> index.value.domain (corrected)
[19:13:23] <robertmaxrees> ...no.  why would you?
[19:13:36] <printForever> because I'm confused to why am I not getting any data
[19:13:38] <robertmaxrees> you said you were accessing the data correctly.  are you not sure about that now?
[19:13:54] <printForever> when I type in the console, manually specifying the index [x] I get correct data
[19:13:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then go ahead and make a fiddle with some sample data :) let's clear it up real quick.
[19:13:59] <printForever> and I merge two values
[19:14:26] <printForever> I'm 1200% sure that I'm acessing the data fine
[19:14:32] <printForever> *accessing
[19:14:41] <robertmaxrees> great, so let me verify the logic against the data :)
[19:14:50] <robertmaxrees> i can wait for a fiddle - it's fine :)
[19:17:52] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/1ax2sz1y/
[19:18:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[19:18:29] <robertmaxrees> where's vwo_$?
[19:19:05] <printForever> sorry https://jsfiddle.net/1ax2sz1y/1/
[19:19:15] <robertmaxrees> also, you can't return out of each like tjhat.
[19:20:37] <robertmaxrees> also: that's not how you make a JS object.
[19:20:41] <printForever> :(
[19:20:49] <robertmaxrees> you want curlies, not parens.
[19:20:51] <printForever> robertmaxrees: I tried to explain the problem...
[19:21:06] <printForever> you now understand what I'm trying to do, better than me
[19:21:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ax2sz1y/3/
[19:21:15] <robertmaxrees> is this what you were trying to make?
[19:21:47] <printForever> yes
[19:21:49] <printForever> ...
[19:22:00] <printForever> I'm soooo... grade A... tard
[19:22:18] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 not an ok word, and 2 looks like you just need to revisit the basics :)
[19:24:34] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, $.each() and Array.prototype.forEach and similar enumeration/iteration methods don't let you return like that out of your callback.
[19:24:52] <robertmaxrees> that's why we have .map() and other similar methods.
[19:31:43] <printForever> thanks
[19:32:56] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[19:49:36] <printForever> robertmaxrees: I'm hitting a wall once again
[19:49:46] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:49:49] <printForever> .each() is outputing strings all at once
[19:49:55] <printForever> instead each object once
[19:50:02] <robertmaxrees> show me duder.
[19:50:03] <printForever> it just plasters all of them at once
[19:50:13] <robertmaxrees> bummer.  i'd need to see it.
[19:50:16] <printForever> I can't show you the output
[19:50:18] <printForever> its...
[19:50:26] <robertmaxrees> bummer.  dunno how i can help then.
[19:50:29] <printForever> I't would take 30 minutes to build the fiddle
[19:50:37] <robertmaxrees> i doubt that.
[19:50:43] <robertmaxrees> you alreayd showed me a fiddle we fixed earlier.
[19:50:49] <printForever> in my current state of mind it would be an hour
[19:50:53] <printForever> its 1:50 AM
[19:51:04] <robertmaxrees> let's reframe this then:
[19:51:52] <robertmaxrees> "Hey, i don't know what i'm doing wrong.  let me try to describe what i'm doing even though i'm not entirely sure.  i can't show you an example.  why can't you help me fix it?"
[19:52:19] <robertmaxrees> like, i don't mean to be a jerk, but it's kind of hard to help when you're not really giving me anything to go off of.
[19:52:25] <printForever> substr.forEach
[19:52:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:52:37] <printForever> you're not to blame
[19:52:40] <printForever> its all good
[19:52:43] <printForever> I'll find a way
[19:52:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not really giving me anything I'd need to help mano.
[19:52:49] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[19:52:51] <printForever> I tortured you enough
[19:56:18] <printForever> in a simple array of objects
[19:56:22] <printForever> string
[19:56:29] <printForever> what is the proper way to use each
[19:56:44] <printForever> jQuery.each(function (index, value)...
[19:57:00] <printForever> do I have to use index and value?
[19:58:00] <printForever> I GOT IT
