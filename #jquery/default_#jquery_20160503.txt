[02:48:05] <Azrael_-> hi
[02:48:12] <Azrael_-> for load balancing for my video player i have to generate the playlist of the player using some backend methods. should i server the player code with a static file and retrieve the playlist using an ajax-call or should i generate the player code (the js-file) using the dynamic backend (php)?
[02:56:02] <Cork> Azrael_-: you could add the urls and have them as data- attributes in the html
[02:56:11] <Cork> Azrael_-: but ya, you should keep your js static
[03:09:10] <Azrael_-> Cork: i need to determine the which url to start by querying all source-servers, calculate the load of each and serve the one with the least load as source. there is no option to do thiw using data-attributes
[03:09:39] <Cork> Azrael_-: sure there is
[03:09:55] <Cork> populate an array with sources and put it in a data-sources="" attribute
[03:10:07] <Cork> then you do $(this).data('sources') to get it in js
[03:10:19] <Azrael_-> Cork: and how do i know what source to select?
[03:10:31] <Cork> it shouldn't be more then one
[03:10:51] <Cork> what i mean you should filter it based on load before you fill the list
[03:11:29] <Cork> Azrael_-: alternatively (and prob what i would do) is to have a small nginx server redirect to the server with the smallest load
[03:11:30] <Azrael_-> and here is the point: i provide my js-file to 3rd party pages to embed this file with a small html-code for adding my player
[03:11:35] <Cork> and have it all point to the same url
[03:12:06] <Cork> then your front end doesn't have to be reevaluated cause it might be old and things like that
[03:13:31] <Azrael_-> i'm doing live video broadcasting and i have to distribute it due to bandwidth-restrictions. no options to send everything through the same server. that's why i have to do an ajax-call to get the best video-server available and load this one into the player
[03:13:47] <Cork> Azrael_-: redirect
[03:13:55] <Cork> the load doesn't go through that server
[03:14:05] <Azrael_-> rtmp redirecting isn't properly supported by all clients
[03:14:14] <Cork> ah
[03:14:42] <Cork> well ya ajax sounds like the only semi good option then
[03:14:49] <Cork> else you will end up with a client using old urls
[03:16:26] <Azrael_-> yeah, i have to avoid caching
[03:21:29] <linherest> jquery ui | slider return wrong value when clicked in slider bar (fullscreen mode). what should i do?
[03:22:02] <Cork> linherest: could you make an example?
[03:22:21] <Cork> i've been using it for years and never had that problem
[03:27:00] <linherest> @cork: i'll tell you more detail
[03:27:21] <Cork> linherest: jsfiddle.net
[03:27:25] <Cork> reproduce the problem
[03:31:44] <linherest> in this case, i can't reproduce the issues when it only has slider. but in my production code, with so many elemenents, it has issues. i can't post source code into jsfiddle.net
[03:32:13] <Cork> linherest: then the problem is most likely with how you're grabbing the references
[03:32:17] <Cork> and not the plugin in it self
[03:36:13] <linherest> i created slider by jquery command.
[03:37:45] <linherest> so, where should i go wrong? could you tell me some common mistake?
[03:53:58] <Cork> linherest: it could be you use $('selector').val() instead of $(this) or something like that
[03:54:00] <Cork> not sure
[04:03:15] <skywater> hi
[04:04:08] <skywater> i have an LI which looks like this: 	<li><div class="liItemData"><a href="#"><b>Artikelnr:</b> DURMN9100B; <b>Omschrijving:</b>1,5 volt Alkali-Mangan batterij MN9100</a></div></li>  on click i get the text: var item = $(e.target).text();  but it sometimes only gets Artikelnr: as text, why is this so?
[04:13:44] <andrew9184> depends what e.target is doesnt it?
[04:15:21] <Cork> skywater, andrew9184: e.target != this, e.target is the clicked element while this is the element with the event handler
[04:15:35] <Cork> so replace e.target with this and it should work
[04:19:03] <skywater> co
[04:19:04] <skywater> Cork,
[04:19:16] <skywater> $('.liItemData a').click(function(e) {
[04:19:17] <skywater> 		   var item = $(e.target).text();
[04:19:27] <skywater> where to put  e.target != this
[04:19:45] <Cork> var item = $(this).text();
[04:19:55] <Cork> should solve it
[04:20:44] <skywater> Cork, it worked but why is this so ?
[04:21:00] <Cork> that is what i meant with e.taget != this
[04:21:10] <Cork> e.target is the "element closest to the mouse"
[04:21:20] <Cork> it isn't the element with the event handler
[04:21:37] <Cork> so ex. in <a><span></span></a> e.target will ALWAYS be the span
[04:21:43] <Cork> while this will be the a tag
[04:21:48] <Cork> (always)
[04:22:20] <Cork> in <a><span>some <b>test</b></span></a> e.target will sometime be span and sometime be b (depending on where you click)
[04:22:24] <Cork> while this will always be a
[04:23:10] <skywater> Cork, so that explains why my code vsometimes worked and sometimes not
[04:23:11] <skywater> :)
[04:23:16] <Cork> ya
[04:23:48] <Cork> and is why i grumble when ppl to function(event) {}.bind(myClass)
[04:23:51] <skywater> so what if you have
[04:24:02] <skywater> <div><a><span></span></a></div>
[04:24:06] <skywater> will this be div?
[04:24:17] <Cork> depends on where you bound the event handler
[04:24:26] <Cork> this is always the element the event handler was on
[04:24:34] <skywater> ah ok ^^
[04:24:36] <skywater> thanks :)
[04:24:38] <Cork> ex. $('div').click => this == div
[04:24:42] <Cork> ex. $('a').click => this == a
[04:24:55] <Cork> ex. $('div').on('click', 'a', func) => this == a
[04:25:35] <skywater> thanks Cork good explanation
[04:27:16] <andrew9184> huh
[04:27:39] <andrew9184> thats exactly what i said
[04:36:27] <AdamPDotty> $('bottle').on('screw', 'cork', drink);
[04:52:32] <UniFreak> any channel about jquer validator?
[04:52:35] <UniFreak> *jquery*
[05:14:04] <Cork> UniFreak: it would be here
[05:19:40] <UniFreak> ok. so I'm using v1.14, I set `ignore:  []`, so it can validate hidden input. the problem is, after I click `submit`, those field include :hidden ones all got validated and output the error message, now I fix those error one by one, those non-hidden fields's error message will be auto-removed, but not those :hidden one. Is there a way to fix this?
[05:21:12] <Cork> UniFreak: try ignore: ':hidden'
[05:22:06] <UniFreak> Cork: I don't want those :hidden field to be ignored
[05:22:23] <UniFreak> that's why I specify ignore:[]
[05:22:34] <Cork> then i don't really follow the problem
[05:22:42] <Cork> are the hidden fields updated through js?
[05:23:12] <UniFreak> my problem is those :hidden field's error message won't auto-disappear after I fix its error
[05:23:20] <UniFreak> others will
[05:23:29] <Cork> how are you fixing them?
[05:23:46] <AdamPDotty> by filling fields?
[05:23:52] <UniFreak> say one :hidden input is `required`, I type in something to fix that
[05:23:55] <Cork> you can't fill hidden fields
[05:24:09] <UniFreak> oh. right. those are filled by js
[05:24:18] <Cork> so either you edit something else and it modifys it through js
[05:24:22] <Cork> or something else
[05:24:31] <UniFreak> through js
[05:24:36] <Cork> ok, then you need to do .trigger('change') on the field when your done
[05:24:52] <Cork> else the validator won't know about it
[05:24:58] <UniFreak> ok. I'll try that
[05:29:49] <UniFreak> Cork: that doesn't solve it
[05:30:05] <Cork> hmm try to trigger the input event then
[05:31:35] <UniFreak> no for `.trigger('input')`, too
[05:31:44] <Cork> one of them should work...
[05:31:51] <Cork> could you make a demo in jsfiddle.net?
[05:32:10] <UniFreak> keyup?
[05:32:23] <UniFreak> Cork: wait
[05:32:30] <Cork> i don't think it would use that, but... possibly
[05:41:47] <UniFreak> Cork: I solved this problem by calling validator.form().  https://jqueryvalidation.org/Validator.form
[05:42:03] <baako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/d61gaymh/7/ i am working with money here. i am expect to turn the result inoto 2 decimal places making it 2749 is they a jquery method i can use for this please
[05:42:06] <Cork> that reevaluates the entire form, but ok
[05:42:39] <baako> 27.49 sorry
[05:43:23] <Uhkis> just divide it by 100?
[05:44:35] <UniFreak> Cork: so I changed to call $('#selector').valid(), according to here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1479255/how-to-manually-trigger-validation-with-jquery-validate/12195091#12195091
[05:44:53] <baako> thanks
[05:44:56] <Cork> baako: https://jsfiddle.net/d61gaymh/8/
[05:44:58] <baako> Uhkis,
[05:45:07] <Cork> if you wan to handle rounding errors
[05:54:32] <baako> Cork, thanks again but one more question please https://jsfiddle.net/aot65vuw/
[05:54:51] <baako> the first console is actually what code contents which is 239
[05:55:15] <baako> do you think i should add the 0?
[05:55:15] <Cork> i don't get the question?
[05:55:39] <Cork> one is ten times bigger before you round it
[05:56:13] <baako> Cork, dont get it sorry
[05:56:35] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/aot65vuw/1/
[05:57:29] <Cork> round will round it at the decimal point, where ever that one is
[05:57:45] <Cork> so if you make it * 10 before rounding it you will get the effect you asked about
[06:01:59] <baako> Cork, do you personally thing that is the 15% of 23.90
[06:02:04] <baako> $
[06:02:10] <baako> think*
[06:02:39] <Cork> uh, depends on what precision you want
[06:02:51] <Cork> its math there isn't a "think" :)
[06:04:15] <Cork> normally you keep the number of decimal precision
[06:04:43] <baako> 15% of 23.90 is 3.585

[06:08:13] <baako> Cork, because what i am getting back get turns into an int i get 23.9
[06:08:37] <baako> which is why i was asking if i should add the 0 making it 23.90
[06:09:32] <baako> from https://jsfiddle.net/aot65vuw/1/ the correct one to me is the second console log

[06:17:25] <baako> https://jsfiddle.net/m1bwvqw3/
[06:17:46] <baako> 15% of 239 is not 0.35

[07:45:38] <skywater> hi
[07:45:51] <taplar2> aloha
[07:46:28] <skywater> http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Filterable-Tree-View-Plugin-with-jQuery-Tree-Filter/    if you search here for example for India, and then press the X to remove the input then the search wont be cleared and the list wont be clickable. However if you remove india with backslash then the list is clickable again
[07:46:33] <skywater> anyone any idea
[07:48:13] <taplar2> it's not refiltering when the x is clicked
[07:49:12] <skywater> how can this be enabled??
[07:49:40] <taplar2> the filter is doing some sort of logic on an event such as input or keyup
[07:49:50] <taplar2> whatever that logic is, should happen after the field has been cleared too
[07:49:53] <Kartagis> skywater: on mac chrome, input is cleared when you press X
[07:50:10] <taplar2> the input is, but the filtered results are not reset
[07:51:20] <skywater> http://paste.ofcode.org/gE2xgUViZrhzxmqVaawamN
[07:51:23] <taplar2> or at least that's what i'm seeing
[07:51:25] <skywater> this is the function for search
[07:51:28] <skywater> taplar2,  you are right
[07:51:38] <skywater> Kartagis,  input is cleared but the results arent refiltered
[07:52:09] <skywater> http://paste.ofcode.org/3nTyPF8kabmhbTe8xspUbq
[07:52:12] <skywater> this is the whole code
[07:52:19] <taplar2> so possibly one of two ways
[07:52:38] <taplar2> rip that keyup method out and put it into a named variable, or name the method
[07:52:49] <taplar2> and call it after you've cleared out the input when clicking the X
[07:53:03] <taplar2> or, do those two lines for when the input is blank at the end of the X clicking logic
[07:56:46] <taplar2> btw, it looks like all your using $(this) for is to get the val().  you could use this.value and save a wrapping
[07:57:09] <taplar2> small thing though
[07:57:40] <skywater> rip that keyup method out and put it into a named variable
[07:58:02] <skywater> i try that
[07:58:02] <skywater> XD
[07:58:08] <taplar2> yup, right now it's an anonymous function you've put directly into the keyup()
[07:58:24] <taplar2> so cut it out and put it in a variable or give it a name
[07:58:31] <taplar2> and then it becomes keyup(theFunctionName)
[07:58:46] <taplar2> so then in your logic for clicking the X at the end you can do theFunctionName() to reuse it
[07:59:02] <skywater> 	var searcher = function() {
[07:59:03] <skywater> 		keyup();
[07:59:31] <taplar2> no you wouldn't call the keyup from that method
[07:59:41] <taplar2> that method will be used by the keyup as it's event handler
[07:59:59] <taplar2> nothing changes except it will have a name and keyup will use that name, instead of being an inline method
[08:01:02] <skywater> ah ok i get it
[08:01:15] <skywater> so i guess something like: $(plugin.settings.searcher).keyup(function(keyUpFunction) {
[08:01:29] <taplar2> lol, your making it harder that it is
[08:02:41] <taplar2> https://jsfiddle.net/ew2o1vav/
[08:03:46] <skywater> thanks XD
[08:10:29] <jose3_> hey there
[08:10:30] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/M4wwd9KF/
[08:10:58] <jose3_> How do I make arrayfromphp available within this function without calling it like this: (actionDate(arrayFromPHP) ?
[08:12:11] <taplar> it'd have to be a variable scoped to the same scope as that method.
[08:12:18] <taplar> what's wrong with passing it in?
[08:12:46] <jose3_> nothing  really, i just think it looks cleaner
[08:12:55] <taplar> and less modular, :)
[08:13:51] <jose3_> well im only using it to clean a piece of code up
[08:13:55] <skywater> taplar, for the search input i use : 	<input class="treeviewInput" type="search" id="my-search" placeholder="zoek een product" onsearch="OnSearch(this)">   OnSearch function i have in the javascript file
[08:14:02] <jose3_> it isnt going to be reused really
[08:14:07] <skywater>  function OnSearch(input) {  < but it doesnt get activated
[08:14:17] <taplar> best practices are always best practices
[08:14:38] <taplar> skywater: don't use inline bindings
[08:14:45] <taplar> bind in your js
[08:14:57] <taplar> and i'm not aware of a pre-existing 'search' event
[08:15:02] <skywater> i also used $('input[type=search]').on('search', function () {
[08:15:25] <taplar> is that real?  *googles*
[08:16:03] <taplar> weird
[08:17:44] <taplar> ah, ok
[08:18:00] <taplar> so it looks like search is also an event, but it happens when the user hits enter in the input or clicks the X
[08:18:42] <skywater> yes
[08:19:21] <taplar> so yeah i'd probably do something like $('#my-search').on('search', function () { ... });
[08:19:54] <taplar> $('#my-search').on('search', OnSearch);
[08:19:58] <taplar> for what you have above
[08:20:23] <skywater> strange thing is, if i put that code in to my external js file then it doesnt work
[08:20:27] <skywater> if i put it above the input field
[08:20:30] <skywater> then it  does work
[08:20:45] <taplar> how are you including this js file?
[08:21:10] <skywater> oh wait
[08:21:11] <skywater> it does work
[08:21:24] <skywater> i had put it in to the  var treefilter = function(el, options) { function
[08:21:30] <skywater> but it must be outside of that omne
[08:21:49] <taplar> right cause of scope
[08:22:05] <taplar> unless you did your binding inside that scope
[08:22:14] <taplar> in which case it'd have access to it
[08:22:57] <PSan> hai I add input, set val(), manually trigger change() with no params to trigger event
[08:23:00] <rethus> I have an <li>, inside an ahref followed by an div with another ul-list. Fired by href, how do I get access to the div?
[08:23:02] <PSan> in the handler val() returns empty
[08:23:02] <PSan> :(
[08:23:06] <PSan> why
[08:23:16] <rethus> If I use next(), I access the next li, but not the div.
[08:23:20] <taplar> PSan: i'd have to see the logic
[08:24:24] <taplar> rethus: <a><li></li><div></div></a>?
[08:25:00] <rethus> wait, I do i jsfillde
[08:25:05] <taplar> :D
[08:26:42] <PSan> taplar, http://pastebin.com/xGEcAS1y
[08:27:25] <PSan> so it manually triggers a change, the listener then receives empty data on input.val()
[08:27:41] <PSan> but the data is copied actually on the input as I can see
[08:27:46] <PSan> then when I change it again it works again
[08:27:51] <skywater> taplar,  http://pastebin.com/5AvuKLMj
[08:27:55] <skywater> i did the binding like this
[08:28:19] <skywater> how can i now call the function: processSearcherValue when i click the x
[08:29:07] <PSan> OH I just found the logic error myself
[08:29:14] <PSan> I trigger the change BEFORE setting the values!
[08:29:21] <rethus> @taplar: this are the structure: https://jsfiddle.net/svymq0ef/
[08:29:25] <taplar> PSan: ah
[08:30:09] <rethus> If I mouseover "Aktuell", I wan't to get the following <div class='naviLevel naviLevel2 xst_naviLevel2'><
[08:30:23] <rethus> right on the same level like the a href
[08:33:23] <taplar> rethus: https://jsfiddle.net/svymq0ef/1/
[08:34:11] <taplar> skywater: ok, where is your X clicking logic?
[08:34:27] <taplar> or is that built in to the input type="search" input?
[08:35:16] <Audlex> is there a tidier way to do this? $(this).parent().next().next().slideToggle();
[08:35:51] <rethus> A I see. great, thank you
[08:36:19] <taplar> Audlex: possibly if there were some classes involved
[08:37:36] <taplar> if $(this).parent().parent() had a class then you could do $(this).closest('.parentClass')
[08:38:07] <taplar> and then if whatever next().next() had a class it would all be $(this).closest('.parentClass').find('.nextNextClass').slideToggle()
[08:49:51] <decx> silblings filter is more apprope
[08:51:12] <taplar_afk> ah true
[09:33:41] <skywater> he taplar
[09:33:46] <skywater> i was afk sorry
[10:25:47] <mariorasch1> Hi there! I currently got a problem eithusing jQuery 2.2.3 on Windows 0 Mobile.
[10:26:40] <mariorasch1> I mean: I currently got a problem with using jQuery 2.2.3 on Windows 10 Mobile.
[10:27:29] <mariorasch1> It seems that click events are omitted once and therefore only work on the second tap.
[10:35:11] <mariorasch1> Is anyone here that could assist with this problem please?
[10:35:59] <AdamPDotty> man windows
[10:36:56] <rethus> is there a way to set toggle() to display:inline-block, instead "block" ?
[10:39:43] <taplar> doesn't look like it
[10:42:07] <AdamPDotty> there is toggleClass as workaround
[11:35:41] <Ackis> Hey everyone - I'm getting an error in IE 11 (in 8 compat mode) SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'getAttribute' File: jquery-1.12.1.min.js, Line: 4, Column: 14060 - this is when I load something in an iframe so the debugger doesn't break as it should (it only does it on the first execution of the code) - any tips on how I can trace this?
[11:41:12] <bango2> Ackis are you trying to getAttribute of an element within the iframe?
[11:43:58] <Ackis> bango2: most likely - inherited code for some custom SharePoint - I'm just trying to figure out where it's break for me to find the root cause
[11:44:36] <bango2> its breaking because there are restrictions about accessing the DOM of iframed content Ackis
[11:44:59] <bango2> if youre iframing from the same domain, you have some options. If not, youre going to have a bad time
[11:53:09] <Ackis> bango2: thanks - I was able to track it down: var URL = $(location).attr("href").replace(/(.*?)SitePages.+/g, "$1") + "_vti_bin/listdata.svc/" + listName;
[12:19:44] <ujo> hi. i have jquery dialog. cant use ui-dialog class because its used by another window. any solution please ?
[12:19:59] <ujo> (changing zindex)
[12:20:01] <robertmaxrees> "cant use ui-dialog class because its used by another window."
[12:20:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:20:57] <ujo> robertmaxrees: i have 2 layers and both are of ui-dialog class, so i cant use ui-dialog to change z-index
[12:21:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:21:15] <robertmaxrees> so you have 2 dialogs open at the same time?
[12:21:50] <ujo> robertmaxrees: sort of
[12:22:14] <robertmaxrees> heh okay.  you can use http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-dialogClass to add another class to the particualr one you care about.
[12:23:25] <ujo> robertmaxrees: thank you.
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[12:28:37] * taplar is in a bidding war!!!
[12:28:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:28:54] <taplar> trying to buy a house
[12:28:58] <robertmaxrees> !
[12:29:00] <robertmaxrees> niiice :)
[12:29:29] <taplar> 50% scared, 50% lets just get it over with, lol
[12:29:43] <robertmaxrees> i remember that feeling.
[12:30:08] <robertmaxrees> except we didn't have a bidding war, the people we bought from were just dumb.
[12:30:18] <taplar> lol
[12:31:02] <robertmaxrees> like, we were in the middle of signing all of the paperwork when they said they were thinking about transferring ownership to a corporation so the wife's mom could get her cut of the proceeds.
[12:31:05] <robertmaxrees> the whole thing was nuts.
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> like, literally their agent called ours while we were signing paperwork.
[12:31:22] <taplar> dang
[12:31:34] <taplar> i feel like this guy is a flipper.  bought it 2 years ago as foreclosure and now selling it
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:31:44] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[12:31:46] <robertmaxrees> nice place?
[12:32:32] <taplar> works for me.  within my price range.  no carpet floors.  needs some love with the roof and other than not having uverse available not bad.  does have comcast access
[12:32:50] <ujo> robertmaxrees: if ui-dialog class has z-index !important, and i add class to ui-dialog as zindex !important, wont these two properties interfere?
[12:33:55] <robertmaxrees> you have to make sure your second rule is higher specificity.
[12:36:02] <_TWG_> You around today taplar?
[12:36:15] <robertmaxrees> taplar has a new friend :)
[12:36:15] <taplar> in the middle of a sandwich, but yep, :)
[12:36:26] <_TWG_> Oh sorry.
[12:36:34] <taplar> it's cool, i'm not the only one here, ;)
[12:36:40] <robertmaxrees> hahaha _TWG_ you can just ask the channel.
[12:36:45] <robertmaxrees> :) if anybody can help, they will.
[12:36:50] <robertmaxrees> including taplar usually.
[12:36:55] <_TWG_> I made a small change to my HTML markup yesterday and now the code you helped me with no longer works.  http://kopy.io/POEUI
[12:37:10] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: the only reason I asked him was because he was helping me yesterday.
[12:37:19] <robertmaxrees> $(this).parent().children('ul.tree').toggle(300);
[12:37:21] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[12:37:29] <_TWG_> When I click the item to toggle my list, it no longer toggles.
[12:37:51] <_TWG_> I wasn't sure how to make it look a level up.
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> .parent-wrapper is a sibling of ul.tree, not a parent.
[12:38:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd .closest('li').find('ul.tree') or something along those lines.,
[12:39:25] <_TWG_> Dang robertmaxrees you are the man.  That fixed it right up.  Thanks for the help.
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com btw :)
[12:39:54] <robertmaxrees> some great tutorials that cover topics like this.
[12:41:37] <_TWG_> I do plan on it.  Thank you for the reference.
[12:57:39] <Siegfried> Hi all basic jquery question
[12:57:40] <Siegfried> If I do something like $('li a') I get all the a's nested under li's
[12:57:43] <Siegfried> How do I get the nth one?
[12:57:56] <taplar> eq(n)
[12:58:22] <Siegfried> taplar: So $('li a').eq(3) for instance will give me the third?
[12:58:28] <Siegfried> Or fourth maybe?
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> the 4th
[12:58:34] <taplar> 4th
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> 0-index
[12:58:39] <Siegfried> Cool thanks
[12:58:42] <Siegfried> :)
[12:58:55] <taplar> and it will be of the result set, not guarenteed to be all of the same parent, if that is a concern
[12:59:30] <Siegfried> That's not a concern
[12:59:34] <Siegfried> Hmm I'm having an issue now though
[12:59:50] <Siegfried> I'm trying to modify certain input elements
[12:59:57] <Siegfried> so
[13:00:01] <Siegfried> $('td input').val('test')
[13:00:07] <Siegfried> works fine, changes all inputs to 'test'
[13:00:13] <Siegfried> but $('td input').eq(0).val('test') doesn't work
[13:00:36] <taplar> if the first works, that one should work as well
[13:00:44] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[13:01:05] <Siegfried> No, console seems to be returning the dom node from what I can tell.  n.fn.n.init {0: input, length: 1, prevObject: n.fn.n.init, context: document, selector: "td input.slice(1,2)"}0: inputcontext: documentlength: 1prevObject: n.fn.n.initselector: "td input.slice(1,2)"__proto__: Object
[13:01:16] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  should work fine.
[13:01:21] <Siegfried> Weird
[13:01:55] <taplar> wait, is that a slice in the selector?
[13:02:20] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:02:26] <taplar> wth?
[13:02:37] <robertmaxrees> Siegfried show us your real code maybe?
[13:02:41] <jose3_> hello world!
[13:03:12] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees:  $('td input').eq(0).val('test')
[13:03:17] <Siegfried> Just running it on the console
[13:03:21] <robertmaxrees> and your markup is valid?
[13:03:29] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: As far as I can tell
[13:03:37] <Siegfried> Hmm oh wait
[13:03:46] <Siegfried> I think there are hidden inputs
[13:03:55] <Siegfried> cause 4 5 6 are working on what I thought was 0 1 2 :D
[13:04:07] <taplar> classes on what you want to target are a good thing, ;)
[13:05:14] <Siegfried> taplar: This website uses no classes or ids ;_;
[13:05:30] <taplar> you writing a greasemonkey script or something?
[13:06:13] <Siegfried> taplar: No, writing a script to help me enroll for the classes I want at my uni :D
[13:06:29] <Siegfried> It's currently full but when someone leaves a spot opens up to the first person to nab it
[13:06:37] <taplar> ah
[13:06:43] <taplar> damn, that's committment
[13:06:59] <taplar> err, motivation
[13:07:10] * taplar isn't good with werds
[13:07:13] <Siegfried> :D more like I want to get my requirements done and over with
[13:07:26] <jose3_> Can someone help me refactor this.... it isn't very dry... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b9aeba60dfeffc45daed5fd30e6ceffa
[13:08:40] <taplar> store the common parts in variables
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> an use bettr nesting.
[13:09:25] <taplar> and the 'else' keyword is also available
[13:11:05] <taplar> it looks like "(actionDate(arrayFromPHP) < getDateTime)" is common to them all, so that's like the outer most if.
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/554ee4cd9ea8 something like https://bpaste.net/show/554ee4cd9ea8
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> oh i messed up the completiondate nesting.
[13:11:53] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can (and should) do that.
[13:12:20] <robertmaxrees> also, cal1, call2, call3 etc - why not have one var that holds the value you care about?
[13:12:35] <taplar> you could also do an array and do an indexOf to avoid some of the if elses
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:12:53] <robertmaxrees> just need to better structure your data.
[13:12:55] <taplar> would shrink it considerably
[13:13:18] <Uhkis> switch would probably be more readable
[13:13:20] <Siegfried> Hi all, one more question.  Any clue how I can get a script to persist after a page refresh?  I am doing a click() with jquery but that triggers a page refresh, and then my script stops working
[13:13:29] <Siegfried> Just running this from within the browser console
[13:13:33] <robertmaxrees> eh, i dislike switch for the same reason i dislike conditionals.
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> Siegfried need something like greasemonkey.
[13:13:59] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: Ooh looks cool
[13:14:05] <taplar> it's awesomesause
[13:14:22] <taplar> i use that to automate playing one of my mud games, :D
[13:14:33] <Siegfried> :D Thanks trying it out now
[13:14:40] <ckb> Hey there fellas quick question (let me know if I'm in the wrong channel). I have a nav bar that I clone(true) and prepend to the body. However the nav bar's "overflow: scroll" will only start working after I click on one of the links in it. Can anyone shed some light on this for me?
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> ckb mind making a fiddle instead?
[13:15:27] <ckb> I can try, I'm never really good at reproducing bugs like this in fiddle.
[13:15:53] <ckb> robertmaxrees: would a link work just as well?
[13:16:55] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: How do I run a greasemonkey script? Just made one to console.log('hello world')
[13:17:26] <taplar> it's based off of the url you tell it to apply against
[13:17:36] <taplar> it will automatically kick off when it matches the url
[13:17:48] <Siegfried> ohhh cool
[13:17:49] <Siegfried> !
[13:17:55] <Siegfried> How have I never heard of this ;_;
[13:18:23] <taplar> you were too busy listening to beastie boys.  you were down with the wrong monkey
[13:19:31] <taplar> i'm not sure that it explicitly says any where, that I found, but you can also use some wildcards with the url
[13:19:36] <taplar> like *
[13:21:35] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: Is there a way to force a script to run on the current webpage? This one seems to have a dynamic url
[13:22:16] <taplar> What's the url?
[13:22:28] <Siegfried> taplar: My university url
[13:22:31] <taplar> and what part is dynamic?
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm really not familiar with it, but you could always target the hostname + path of the pages.
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> or something similar.
[13:22:54] <Siegfried> Hmm okay
[13:23:13] <taplar> https://univ.org/common/part/*
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> not sure what options greasemonkey as for that kind of stuff.
[13:23:42] <taplar> i know * works, not familiar with others
[13:24:32] <taplar> i use this one when viewing the jquery chat logs, :D  https://jsfiddle.net/4pmL0ye9/
[13:24:45] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:28:37] <Siegfried> SUCCESS!
[13:28:39] <Siegfried> Thanks all :)
[13:28:53] <Siegfried> Now all I have to do is leave my computer running for a week connected to the internet ;_;
[13:29:34] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea fwiw.
[13:30:31] <robertmaxrees> should get setup a small box on something like aws for cheap and do it there instead.
[13:31:10] <taplar> can't you like, ya know, talk to the professors and ask them to add you?  i vaguely remember professors being able to get in people over their thresholds...
[13:31:33] <robertmaxrees> ^ or talk to your advisors about working on this with you?
[13:33:13] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: I've never tried to setup an external server before and I'm sure it'd take me a few days to figure out :(
[13:33:15] <Siegfried> Don't have the time atm
[13:33:27] <Siegfried> taplar: Yeah I've asked but professor's a bit of an ass
[13:33:34] <robertmaxrees> what about your advisor?
[13:33:43] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: Haven't asked, but don't think there's much he can do
[13:33:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd try that, too.
[13:35:41] <_TWG_> Siegfried your professor sucks.  No offense.
[13:36:07] <_TWG_> I know where I work, our Professors will setup a small box for a student for anything.
[13:36:35] <taplar> what are we talking about?
[13:37:12] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ i think he meant that the professor is just unhelpful as far as adding him in as an extra student.
[13:37:15] <robertmaxrees> not about setting up the box.
[13:37:26] <_TWG_> oh okay.  my bad
[13:37:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:37:37] <Siegfried> One more newbie question.  I'm trying to access a td with $('tr td').eq(3) and it's giving me back an object Object { 0: <td>, length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument → fast2.do, selector: "tr td.slice(3,4)" }
[13:37:42] <Siegfried> How do I actually get the content contained int he td?
[13:37:51] <Siegfried> like <td>some content</td>
[13:37:52] <robertmaxrees> what content do you want?
[13:37:55] <robertmaxrees> the text?
[13:37:58] <robertmaxrees> or another element?
[13:37:59] <Siegfried> yes
[13:38:02] <Siegfried> the text
[13:38:03] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[13:38:07] <Siegfried> :O
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> $('tr td').eq(3).text()
[13:38:15] <Siegfried> thank you

[14:00:43] <_TWG_> I'm trying to trigger a console.log on a click event.  For some reason it is not running.  http://kopy.io/uq2WC
[14:00:59] <Siegfried> Hi all, how do I get the a child of  $('#fastLeftNavCell ul li ul li').eq(3) ?
[14:02:25] <robertmaxrees> Siegfried check out the learning center :)
[14:02:30] <robertmaxrees> .find(), .children(), etc.
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways.
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ ?

[14:03:10] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hdju2tup/
[14:03:12] <robertmaxrees> works find.
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[14:03:38] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ are you maybe dynamically creating those anchors?
[14:03:55] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: yes i am
[14:03:59] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:04:01] <Siegfried> kopy.io is a sick pastebin
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> you can't bind to things that don't exist.
[14:04:07] <Siegfried> choose your color scheme ;_;
[14:04:11] <robertmaxrees> try using event delegation instead.
[14:04:30] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ explain the idea.
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ the rough idea is you bind to a parent element that exists on pageload, then pass a second argument to .on() that's the child selector for the thing you want to match on.
[14:05:42] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: I actually had just found https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:05:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:09:38] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> Good gambl0re.  How're you?
[14:10:32] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: that worked like a charm.  Thanks for the point in the right direction.
[14:10:34] <gambl0re> im good
[14:11:32] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ yeah definitely.  delegation is a really awesome concept and will help you in a lot of future cases.  I use it even when I might not be dynamically creating things purely because it helps decouple my markup from my js.
[14:12:57] <_TWG_> Awesome.  Good information to have robertmaxrees
[14:13:10] <MalMen> https://jsfiddle.net/dcs24ssv/ <- Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string(…)InjectedScript._evaluateOn @ (program):145InjectedScript._evaluateAndWrap @ (program):137InjectedScript.evaluate @ (program):118
[14:13:14] <MalMen> why is that error ?
[14:13:34] <MalMen> i must be doing something stupid
[14:13:45] <robertmaxrees> window.location.pathname."/can/"
[14:13:57] <robertmaxrees> in fact, window.location.pathname."/can/".$this.val(), this whole line doesn't make sense.
[14:14:03] <robertmaxrees> + is the stirng concat operator for JS.,
[14:14:16] <MalMen> ahhhh
[14:14:35] <MalMen> damn... comming from php... my head is mixed
[14:14:36] <Siegfried> Hi all, sorry to ask so many questions, I have a tricky one
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> also - can isn't defined anywhere.
[14:15:05] <robertmaxrees> not sure if you intend it to be global or not.
[14:15:10] <Siegfried> I'm trying to edit a <select>, which I can do no problem with .val()   However, the <select> is listening for an onChange which isn't triggered when I use .val() to set it
[14:15:15] <Siegfried> Any idea how I can fire the onChange?
[14:15:34] <robertmaxrees> Siegfried depends on how the event handler was bound.
[14:15:40] <robertmaxrees> Siegfried .trigger('change') if it's a jquery event listener.
[14:16:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events
[14:17:08] <Siegfried> robertmaxrees: http://kopy.io/w5l1B
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> yuck.
[14:17:23] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you'll need to do some reading.
[14:17:32] <Siegfried> Aight, thanks
[14:19:03] <Siegfried> No need, .trigger('onchange') works :D
[14:19:08] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[14:19:25] <Siegfried> Well makes sense since the html has an onchange property right?
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery events and native events exist in two different worlds, so it's kind of a crapshoot,
[14:19:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:19:45] <Siegfried> Hmm okay
[14:19:58] <Siegfried> I've done some JS mainly with node and react but never used jquery :D
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery handles events on its own outside of the native DOM ones.
[14:20:04] <Siegfried> This is all black magic to me
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> hahaha, totally different - the DOM is much worse ;)
[14:21:31] <gambl0re> is it common to be handed over a pdf with the mockups and a psd file with the assets and to go build a website?
[14:22:02] <robertmaxrees> maybe not a pdf, but the PSD file isn't uncommon from what I've seen.
[14:22:11] <robertmaxrees> PSDs are convenient for mocks i suppose.
[14:22:55] <robertmaxrees> err, PDFs.
[14:34:04] <MalMen> $.post(window.location.pathname+"/can/"+3,{'_token': $('meta[name=csrf-token]').attr('content')},function(data) {});
[14:34:23] <MalMen> must be doing something wrong again
[14:34:39] <MalMen> only return object readystate1
[14:34:52] <robertmaxrees> "only return object readystate1" meaning...?
[14:34:58] <robertmaxrees> that's what you're getting back?
[14:35:07] <MalMen> Object {readyState: 1}
[14:35:11] <MalMen> is not doing the post
[14:35:23] <robertmaxrees> what does the network tab show you?
[14:35:45] <MalMen> wow
[14:36:02] <MalMen> i was expecting it to show the request on console
[14:36:08] <MalMen> it is working actualy
[14:36:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:36:38] <MalMen> thank you :D
[14:38:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:43:56] <Siegfried> Thanks guys my bot works
[14:44:04] <Siegfried> Now I just have to leave my computer running indefinitely :D
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely. that's why we're here :)
[14:44:11] <Siegfried> <3
[14:44:14] <robertmaxrees> still might talk to your advisor fwiw.
[14:44:20] <Siegfried> Yeah will do
[14:44:29] <Siegfried> Also hopefully they don't detect this bot and expel me ;D
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> ^ heh
[14:45:27] <Siegfried> Is it possible to get buy a server, install firefox with greasemonkey, and then run this script?
[14:45:33] <Siegfried> Or can you only do bash script kind of stuff?
[14:45:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you'd do in that case.
[14:45:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd use node with phantomjs to do that instead.
[14:45:54] <Siegfried> Hmm okay
[14:46:13] <robertmaxrees> you could recycle a good amount of current code with that, too.
[14:46:21] <Siegfried> Yeah I'd imagine all of it actually
[14:46:22] <Siegfried> It's just jquery
[14:46:34] <robertmaxrees> *javascript ;)
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> and there'd be some differences in how you'd run your code.
[14:47:50] <Siegfried> Sure
[14:48:02] <Siegfried> Will keep it in mind, though I don't relaly want to spend the money :D
[14:48:33] <robertmaxrees> lol you really wouldn't spend very much at all.
[14:49:24] <robertmaxrees> hell, you could get in on the AWS free tier - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
[14:49:49] <Siegfried> ooh interesting
[14:49:50] <robertmaxrees> and you wouldn't need anything powerful.
[14:50:25] <Siegfried> Hmm maybe I'll do it just for the learning experience
[14:51:31] <robertmaxrees> I have an elb setup using 2 t2.micro instances that are handling over 750 rpms
[14:51:58] <robertmaxrees> err, *rpm
[14:53:47] <Siegfried> Cool
[14:54:08] <Siegfried> I'll have to learn how to write ansible scripts :D
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[14:54:24] <robertmaxrees> if that's your goal i guess.
[14:54:35] <Siegfried> Isn't that how you make servers do things?
[14:54:52] <robertmaxrees> it's one way to automate things.
[14:54:55] <robertmaxrees> i've never needed it.
[14:56:12] <Siegfried> Okay well I'm heading out.  Thanks again robertmaxrees!
[15:14:11] <_TWG_> I wish leafletjs had an irc channel.
[15:14:43] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[15:14:47] <robertmaxrees> #leaflet
[15:14:55] <robertmaxrees> here on freenode.
[15:15:40] <_TWG_> Wow.  I was trying leafletjs since they have that on everything else.
[15:22:59] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees are you familiary with leafletjs?
[15:23:10] <jose3_> Hey
[15:23:15] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ nope.
[15:23:23] <jose3_> Is there a cleaner way to write this ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bb42eeefb026fa3f05f38e6e878ae02c
[15:23:37] <robertmaxrees> _TWG_ you could try asking your question anyway.  somebody in the channel might know.
[15:23:44] <_TWG_> robertmaxrees: okay.  thought i might try.  they are dead in the other room.
[15:24:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, just try asking.
[15:24:14] <_TWG_> in this one or the other
[15:24:15] <_TWG_> ?
[15:24:18] <robertmaxrees> here.
[15:25:53] <_TWG_> I'm working with leafletjs and when I click on an item in my menu it adds a marker just fine.  Now I'm trying to remove that marker whenever another marker is being added.  My code so far is here http://kopy.io/Z0KNy
[15:26:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of using kopy, use jsfiddle.
[15:26:12] <robertmaxrees> make a standalone test case.
[15:27:04] <_TWG_> well I didn't want to use my key for my map since I'm using it somewhere else already.
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> heh good luck then :)
[15:27:55] <robertmaxrees> jose3_ you could make a single object whose props contain the data for swc1_incomplete, etc - then create a data attribute on the differe .target0 etc elements whose value matches those property names.
[15:28:00] <robertmaxrees> then just use .each()
[15:28:06] <robertmaxrees> or something along those lines.
[15:30:09] <merced> c
[16:41:51] <m1chael> im using jquery mobile and transitioning from one page to another does not update the location bar with the url.. url always just stays as http://domain
[16:42:34] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9497699
[16:56:26] <ploop> I have a form which contains a text input which is only for javascript purposes and is never submitted (the form is submitted, but not that field). that field has a keydown event which includes enter and tab. however, now that the form has a submit button, pressing enter within that field submits the form instead of running the keydown
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> have your event handler for that field do an e.preventDefault();
[16:57:39] <ploop> robertmaxrees: what is e here?
[16:57:47] <ploop> literally just e, or $(this) or something?
[16:57:52] <robertmaxrees> the event object.
[16:57:55] <robertmaxrees> so what's your current handler?
[16:58:15] <ploop> I have .keydown(function(event) {
[16:58:19] <ploop> so event I think
[16:58:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:58:28] <ploop> all right, thanks
[16:59:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.
[17:19:23] <JavaLover> can u pass a function to history.pushState?
[17:19:33] <robertmaxrees> and do what with it?
[17:19:54] <JavaLover> call it  on popstate?
[17:19:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:20:08] <JavaLover> why not?
[17:20:19] <robertmaxrees> what are you envisioning?
[17:20:40] <JavaLover> instead of coding a bunch of on popstate events
[17:20:53] <JavaLover> just pass a known variable for a function
[17:21:11] <robertmaxrees> i feel like maybe we're crossing wires.
[17:21:22] <JavaLover> currently my code works like this
[17:21:36] <JavaLover> if(event.state.foo == true){ //load the pop state stuff}
[17:21:51] <JavaLover> what I want is event.state.yeahloadstuff
[17:22:08] <JavaLover> then in my other area where I code the stuff I want to have happen, I can just pass that to the popstate
[17:22:25] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't pop a function into the first arg if that's what you mean.
[17:22:42] <JavaLover> but i'm already doing this...
[17:22:49] <JavaLover> I just can't pass it to the event.state for some reason
[17:23:01] <JavaLover> event.state seems to hold variables just fine, but it won't hold functions...
[17:23:04] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:23:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a good thing.
[17:23:11] <JavaLover> why?
[17:23:14] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to put a function in there in the first place.
[17:23:17] <robertmaxrees> because it's data, not logic.
[17:23:35] <JavaLover> so then aww I know what I can do
[17:23:52] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:23:52] <JavaLover> onpopstate(){load(event.state.var);
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> what "load" function is that?
[17:24:15] <JavaLover> yeah this will work just fine
[17:24:17] <JavaLover> it's a custom one I make
[17:24:23] <JavaLover> this way I can keep track of it
[17:24:27] <robertmaxrees> okay yeah - you just pass that data to a function.
[17:24:39] <JavaLover> yes and I can add to that, maybe it's even an object i'm calling to
[17:24:51] <JavaLover> sucks though means everytime I add a popstate I have to define an action listener I guess
[17:25:02] <JavaLover> but it's fine 2 lines of code instead of just the 1.
[17:25:10] <JavaLover> and accomplishes same thing.
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm still lost, but OK.
[17:25:15] <JavaLover> sooo basically
[17:25:23] <JavaLover> instead of passing event.state.thisfunctiononload
[17:25:38] <JavaLover> I will put in my code "alwaystrytoload()"
[17:25:56] <JavaLover> and then I can put inside the alwaystrytoload() a handler like "what's the function associated with your popstate"
[17:26:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:26:11] <robertmaxrees> you're not, like, generating javascript are you?
[17:26:21] <JavaLover> well know but like
[17:26:24] <JavaLover> no*
[17:26:33] <robertmaxrees> something here seems really "off" to me.
[17:26:39] <JavaLover> it's not
[17:26:47] <JavaLover> I just always have a function, the function can be simple
[17:26:52] <JavaLover> like maybe "hide this" "show that"
[17:27:02] <robertmaxrees> it's basically just store a state object, call a function when the pop happens.
[17:27:06] <JavaLover> yup
[17:27:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:27:14] <robertmaxrees> that's how you normally do that.
[17:27:21] <JavaLover> right but I want to streamline it
[17:27:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:27:28] <JavaLover> so I don't have to keep adding to the popstate function
[17:27:29] <robertmaxrees> that *is* streamlined.
[17:27:37] <JavaLover> but my popstate now has like 50 checks
[17:27:39] <JavaLover> it's annoying
[17:27:41] <robertmaxrees> right, so that one function can do a bunch of other things.
[17:27:43] <JavaLover> ok maybe only 7 but still
[17:27:56] <JavaLover> i'd rather an array of functions that I can add to
[17:28:26] <JavaLover> same way I utilize like .load("",function(){//do this on load});
[17:28:28] <robertmaxrees> really you want a router
[17:28:42] <JavaLover> pretty much yeah
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> so then why not just use a framework that'll manage all of that for you?
[17:29:03] <JavaLover> i hate frameworks
[17:29:08] <JavaLover> too bulky, much rather roll my own
[17:29:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:29:24] <robertmaxrees> your time to spend i suppose.
[17:29:33] <JavaLover> true
[17:29:49] <JavaLover> anyways thx for the talk gonna make this now
[18:59:10] <rogger_h> Hey guys , anyone knows of a resource that can tell me what sources (files js/css) are not used by my website and they are just sitting there making my load time higher
[19:59:29] <Tagor> does jquery automatically unbind event handlers when the element is removed?
[20:55:20] <moeSizlak> i need to read the first X bytes of an HTTP response
[20:55:23] <moeSizlak> how to do it
[20:55:41] <moeSizlak> i don not want the client to download more than X bytes of the response
[21:08:41] <shoky_> moeSizlak: my answer here has an example, maybe it can help you. see the `retrieveVideo` function  http://stackoverflow.com/a/25962425/1098884
[21:09:21] <moeSizlak> does it use http range header?
[21:09:27] <shoky_> yes
[21:09:29] <moeSizlak> cus not all servers support that so i dont want to use it
[21:10:06] <shoky_> good luck then ;p
[21:10:10] <moeSizlak> literally just want to check the first 0-10 bytes to see if its an image
