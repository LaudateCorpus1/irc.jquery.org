[14:41:30] <wilkc> greetings -- i am working on a ping script using jquery and ajax. i got everything working except that my element html changes are not loading in the way i would except. it appears they wait to load until a large chunk of the ajax calls have completed and in the interim, the html of the element just disappears (instead of keeping the loading graphic).
[14:41:59] <robertmaxrees> wilkc mind sharing your code?  hard to help if we can't see it :)
[14:42:24] <wilkc> sure ill see if i cant figure out how to use the code pasters -- may take me a hot minute :)
[14:44:21] <robertmaxrees> fwiw it doesn't need to function.  just seeing the code can be helpful sometimes.
[14:46:43] <wilkc> https://jsfiddle.net/hkrc0nmy/2/
[14:47:28] <wilkc> i had to manually type that in because my IRC client is awful and wouldnt let me copy pasta
[14:47:53] <wilkc> and i left in my debugging console code. probably the noobish way to look at it
[14:49:02] <robertmaxrees> okay so what's the bug?  how do i reproduce.
[14:50:18] <robertmaxrees> is it that the .html() calls aren't happening when you think they should?  inside the beforeSend, success, and complete?
[14:50:40] <wilkc> so once the script fires off, my empty hexagon icon changes to the loading gif as expected, and as results come back in from my backend the loading gif goes away completely and im left with no indicator. once it gets to the last set of completes, then the element manipulation shows up of either a green or red filled hexagon
[14:51:23] <wilkc> this is my first attempt at jquery and ajax (im a decade late to the game but its pretty sweet)
[14:52:12] <robertmaxrees> sorry, trying to wrap my head around the problem - mind addressing the question I just asked? :)
[14:53:10] <wilkc> yes that is correct
[14:53:26] <wilkc> success triggers and complete triggers but the html doesn't change until after some time has passed
[14:53:36] <robertmaxrees> how much time?
[14:53:38] <wilkc> in the interim im left with a blank nothing
[14:53:51] <wilkc> maybe 30 seconds
[14:54:29] <wilkc> it appears to do the ajax calls 6 at a time according to the beginSend statement's console triggering... and its the last group of six starting before i see any feedback on the html changes
[14:55:05] <wilkc> i didnt put the table in for all 30 hosts... wanted to simplify the html part the code
[14:55:11] <robertmaxrees> can you flesh out the fiddle with more divs to demonstrate?
[14:55:23] <robertmaxrees> having even just 3 would be awesome.
[14:55:53] <wilkc> does fiddle simulate ajax calls?
[14:56:20] <robertmaxrees> it has a way to do it, but just seeing a more indicative example of the markup would be nice.
[15:00:09] <wilkc> sure, standby -- need to redact some sensitive info
[15:00:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[15:01:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean, something like this woulda worked: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/joqLb0pk/ :)
[15:01:23] <robertmaxrees> also added the ajax stuff from jsfiddle.
[15:02:23] <robertmaxrees> so my next question is: are you sure this isn't that those SVGs are taking forever to load
[15:02:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:05:29] <robertmaxrees> wilkc because, for instance, this seems to work just fine: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/joqLb0pk/5/
[15:06:34] <wilkc> okay that is a good possibility
[15:06:46] <wilkc> maybe i should have that stuff preloaded and hidden just in case
[15:06:59] <wilkc> and use a class to hide and unhide
[15:07:05] <robertmaxrees> that's one idea.
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> also make sure your server isn't turning off caching for them.
[15:08:14] <wilkc> its django and im running it locally at the moment -- in a weird spot where my dev and prod arent completely identical due to security reasons
[15:08:25] <robertmaxrees> sure - still worth validating :)
[15:10:31] <wilkc> okay, i will go down this path and seek. thanks for your help
[15:32:44] <wilkc> robertmaxrees: got it working. "Your eyes can play tricks on you. Don't trust them." ~Obi-wan Kenobi
[15:32:52] <wilkc> it was a caching issue
[15:40:50] <robertmaxrees> hah - called it :)
[15:45:10] <wilkc> may the force be with you :)
[16:44:05] <rewrited> hello. I need to create some events in jQuery. in summary I need that in the event of clicking on an image, depending on the size of that image, the Bootstrap modal is displayed in a way. and consequently, if the image has a different size, the modal should be displayed in another way. thank you very much for your attention and help!
[17:00:02] <Hopplahase> rewrited: What part of that are you having problems with?
[17:04:18] <rewrited> Hopplahase: I'm having problems within the modal. I didn't mention it, but there is a slider (Owl Carousel) within the modal. and when changing images, they need to be displayed correctly according to size. forgive me if I'm not being clear and thank you very much.
[17:06:11] <Hopplahase> You can get the dimenstions of the image with .width()/.height(), then set the sliders accordingly
[17:08:27] <rewrited> Hopplahase: yes, I even got that part. however, when I switch from a landscape image to a portrait image, the script is not recognizing that change. maybe because the Owl event is missing.
[17:10:20] <Hopplahase> It's probably best if you'd paste a minimal example that shows the problem, hard to help otherwise
[17:14:33] <rewrited> Hopplahase: yes, I agree. after talking to you I ended up thinking of an alternative. I'll try, if it doesn't work I'll put it on jsfiddle. thank you very much for your help!
[17:15:00] <Hopplahase> No problem :p
[18:36:21] <Enissay> $("ul.Actions a[title='Change Queue']").attr('href', (i, value) => `${value || ""}fixedVal=xxxxx;`);   ==> This appends "fixedVal=..." to href, how to modify it to remove it ?
[18:36:41] <Enissay> Not familiar to this syntax :-/
[18:37:00] <robertmaxrees> remove what?
[18:37:03] <robertmaxrees> fixedVal?
[18:37:13] <Enissay> Yes, till the end
[18:37:31] <Enissay> I could use Regex if needed, I just need the correct syntax
[18:37:40] <Enissay> to replace
[18:37:43] <robertmaxrees> `${value || ""}fixedVal=xxxxx;` is a template string - just remove it and you'll be good to go.
[18:37:51] <robertmaxrees> *remove fixedVal= or whatever
[18:38:38] <Enissay> Well, actually what this does, is that it appends a given value to the link, later I want to remove that same value
[18:38:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:40:59] <robertmaxrees> "later i want to remove that same value" need to be more specific about what you mean by "later" :)
[18:41:57] <Enissay> That's my question: how to adapt that same expression to remove the appended fixed value
[18:42:24] <robertmaxrees> that's... not how that works :)
[18:42:34] <robertmaxrees> so first off - why do you need to append this onto the URL?
[18:42:42] <robertmaxrees> if later you want to remove it.
[18:44:45] * robertmaxrees plays the Jeopardy think music
[18:46:17] <Enissay> Okay, this worked: $("ul.Actions a[title='Change Queue']").attr('href', (i, value) => `${value || ""}`.replace( new RegExp("fixedVal=.*","g"),""));
[18:46:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah but...
[18:46:38] <Enissay> The backticks confused me x_x
[18:46:46] <robertmaxrees> why add it in the first place if you're just going to remove it later?
[18:46:51] <robertmaxrees> and that's called a template string.
[18:47:40] <Enissay> I'm just working on a userscript to enhance one of our portals... For personal use... I don't have access to the source code...
[18:48:03] <robertmaxrees> oh it's added by the page and you're trying to remove it via your script?
[18:48:40] <Enissay> Nope, I'm using it to send extra parameters to the page
[18:48:48] <robertmaxrees> lol so confused but alright.
[18:49:37] <Enissay> yeah, as I said, I just started and not fully clear what I want... probably I'll endup starting over from scratch as usual xD
[18:49:50] <Enissay> robertmaxrees: thanks buddy ;-)
[18:49:55] <robertmaxrees> just wanted to make sure you were solving the right problem.
[18:51:30] <Enissay> robertmaxrees: Haha, I know, I hang here/freenode a lot and know people get annoyed when newbies ask the wrong dumb questions :P
[18:51:58] <robertmaxrees> not about the question being wrong or dumb, just doing my due diligence ;)
[18:58:27] <Enissay> <3
