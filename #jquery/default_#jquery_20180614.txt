[02:10:34] <aiena> I have a link to a url which picks a random mirror each time
[02:10:41] <aiena> SOme mirrors may be broken
[02:11:17] <aiena> so I would like to use a jquery ajax call to repeatedly call the link a set number of times till it finds a working mirror
[02:11:20] <aiena> how to do that
[02:24:13] <pavonia> Issue the AJAX call, in the success handler do whatever you want to do if you found a working mirror, and in the error handler increase your counter and if below the maximum number start over with the AJAX call
[02:27:56] <aiena> pavonia: the working mirror is a redirect
[02:28:02] <aiena> how do I get the redirected URL
[02:29:33] <aiena> suppose I call https://foo.com/bar.appImage this url is constant but it redirects to a random mirror.com/bar.appImage how do I get the mirror.com Url. I just want to test if the URL works but not get the resource.
[02:36:42] <pavonia> I don'T think this will work with AJAX requests. What would you do after you found that the redirect would work?
[02:37:08] <Woet> aiena: what are they mirroring?
[02:37:21] <aiena> open source software
[02:37:23] <aiena> appImages
[02:37:32] <aiena> so it is a file that needs to be downloaded
[02:37:52] <aiena> I wanted to rotate till I find a working mirror site and then do window.location
[02:38:00] <aiena> to give the user a choice to download the file
[02:38:24] <aiena> the main url remains the same the mirror it redirects to may give a 404
[02:38:48] <aiena> I want to find a working mirror URL from the main URL
[02:39:33] <aiena> maybe ajax is inappropriate is there another solution
[02:39:52] <Woet> aiena: any backend language could easily do it.
[02:40:02] <Woet> aiena: or you can use a load balancer with any of the popular cloud services.
[02:42:25] <aiena> Woet: I want to do it on the client side
[02:42:31] <Woet> aiena: why?
[02:42:32] <aiena> because the server is beyond control
[02:42:44] <aiena> I have the main URL
[02:42:46] <Woet> if you say so
[02:42:50] <aiena> but the mirror it picks is random
[02:42:56] <Woet> good luck with CORS
[02:43:09] <aiena> SO its not possiblr
[02:43:12] <aiena> possible
[02:46:35] <pavonia> Maybe you could send a HEAD request, so that the whole document isn't transfered, but I can'T seem to find a way to get the redirected URL
[02:52:05] <aiena> I did some digging
[02:52:16] <aiena> The main URL returns no payload
[02:52:26] <aiena> but in the response headers there are several "Link" ones
[02:52:52] <aiena> I wonder if I can parse the response headers and extral these mirror URLS from it
[05:59:41] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:02:29] <jomofcw> Using AJAX to update the content of an element, is there a way to apply some change "automaticaly" (for example : hidding the radio button and replace it by some customized button) each time I update the content of the element with new content loaded using AJAX ? I know how to keep the binded event using delegation to the parent, but to apply always the same changes to the loaded content...
[06:02:29] <jomofcw> dunno :/.
[06:08:43] <jomofcw> In fact, I'm looking for an event like "change" applyed to the container which I update the content using AJAX. When the content of this container "changer" it trigger the "change" event and execute some stuff.
[06:15:48] <jomofcw> Perhaps using a MutationObserver... dunno if is there any jQuery thing like the MutationObserver...
[06:16:36] <preference> how do i diagnose uncaught syntaxerrors where the reference given is something like (index):532?
[06:19:17] <Cork> jomofcw: jquery adds helpers, so just use mutationObserver if you want it
[06:19:33] <Cork> jomofcw: though it is normally better to have the code replacing things handle it
[06:23:13] <Cork> preference: well (index) is in the unnamed url path/to/something/ so just check there
[06:24:07] <jomofcw> Cork hello ^^ !
[06:24:32] <jomofcw> I'm not sure to understand "jquery adds helpers"...
[06:36:27] <jomofcw> Cork do you mean tha jQuery provide helpers to use MutationObserver ?
[07:01:10] <jomofcw> Anyway, MutationObserver seems to be exactly what i need, i'll try using it ^^.
[07:08:57] <Cork> jomofcw: no, jquery doesn't though it might come in jquery 4 time will tell :)
[07:10:26] <Cork> (it does fit into the area that jquery covers, though it is rarely something needed to use as long as the one using jquery actually controls the area jquery is used on (not injected on anothers site)
[08:14:43] <jomofcw> Cork OK thanks ^^.
[09:41:21] <Dro> Hello, how can I find if a div have sub div with class .error?
[09:47:28] <preference> div>div, .error
[09:47:46] <preference> all divs of divs with class .error should be selected by this if i'm not wrong, which i may be. but it will be something like this
[09:48:37] <preference> Dro:
[09:53:34] <Miles8of9> where can i find a plain jquery crud tutorial with validation and get/post to json?
[09:55:01] <preference> i googled "crud with json" and found this. not sure if it's helpful https://medium.com/@martinlasek/tutorial-write-a-crud-api-using-json-a1d4781fd7eb
[10:06:42] <V7> Hey all
[10:07:21] <preference> o/
[10:09:23] <Cork> uh, div>div, .error will select all divs that are a direct child of another div or if the element has a .error class
[10:09:30] <Cork> not if a sub div has the class .error
[10:10:08] <Cork> Miles8of9: you should _always_ have data validation server side
[10:10:23] <Cork> Miles8of9: only do validation in json to smooth the experience
[10:10:50] <Miles8of9> of course
[10:14:15] <V7> jQuery tells wrong slecor for "$("div.class1 h4 a:first")", is it ?
[10:14:25] <V7> selector *
[10:17:29] <V7> Anyone ?
[10:17:57] <preference> i don't know what you mean
[10:17:58] <V7> Gives: Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute '$' on 'CommandLineAPI': 'div.class1 h4 a:first' is not a valid selector.
[10:18:26] <preference> Cork: why can i not use time.getUTCHours() inside console.log? is this intended?
[10:18:51] <Cork> preference: what makes you think you can't?
[10:18:52] <preference> (it's already been defined with time = new Date() so there's no syntax issue outside of this)
[10:19:10] <preference> http://jsfiddle.net/d69aesy3/15/
[10:19:47] <Cork> time++; <--
[10:20:05] <preference> time++ works on the pure Date()
[10:20:10] <Cork> you're converting it from a time function to a number
[10:20:34] <V7> So ?
[10:21:04] <Cork> you need to do time.setHours(time.getHours() + 1) would work
[10:21:19] <Cork> if it isn't a date object you won't have the date properties
[10:21:33] <preference> to be clear, i just want a single integer like 15
[10:22:20] <Cork> preference: var time = new Date(); time.setHours(time.getHours() + 1); time.getUTCHours()
[10:22:42] <Cork> time++ will convert the date object to a number
[10:23:04] <Cork> so getUTCHours or any of the other date methods won't exist
[10:23:09] <preference> ah
[10:23:11] <preference> now i understand. thanks a lot :)
[10:23:38] <Cork> alternatively you can do var time = new Date(); time.getUTCHours() + 1
[10:23:55] <Cork> or (new Date()).getUTCHours() + 1
[10:24:18] <preference> right, but just time++; will convert it because it's dynamically typed :)
[10:24:28] <preference> cheers
[10:24:50] <shoky> V7: that error is not coming from jquery, seems to be from selenium webdriver or something, using the built-in $ in the console
[10:24:58] <Cork> time++ is the same as time = time + 1
[10:25:11] <Cork> and that is the same as time = (new Date()) + 1
[10:25:17] <Cork> and that isn't a date object
[10:25:27] <shoky> V7: which expects a valid css selector (not jquery selector).  and :first  is not valid in regular css
[10:28:35] <Cork> men when is xarg going to verify his account... he has been looping for what two weeks now...?
[10:29:45] <shoky> parts/joins/quits/nick-change have long been muted for this channel in my client ;p
[10:31:04] <Cork> the problem with that is you sitting and answers complex questions when the asker has left
[10:31:50] <shoky> ya that's annoying sometimes, but far less than the alternative, for me
[10:32:25] <Cork> been looking into a part join filter, might have to sit down and finish that script
[10:34:33] <shoky> heh
[10:35:49] <Cork> or i just put an ignore on him XD
[10:36:45] <shoky> ;]
[12:45:05] <_genuser_> function formatSeat(seat){  return $.extend(seat, { Username: seat.Name });
[12:45:33] <_genuser_> question: is this method just adding a new property to the existing object? A new property called Username and copying into it .Name value?
[12:46:03] <robertmaxrees> you missing a curly in there?
[12:46:22] <_genuser_> from documentation online I see it merges two objects. merging an object with itself this way seems to me to be just adding a new property to it.
[12:46:39] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: yep, I forgot the last }.
[12:46:57] <_genuser_> at this point, just trying to understand existing code.
[12:47:34] <robertmaxrees> and that's not all .extend does
[12:48:35] <robertmaxrees> it's merging the contents - ie it breaks references so later changes to your seat object aren't reflected in the base objkect.
[12:48:59] <_genuser_> robertmaxrees: but is my understanding correct that the above function formatSeat is just going to end up adding a new property to the object?
[12:49:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not all it's doing, but that's one of the things it's doing.
[12:49:37] <_genuser_> breaks references meaning if properties are object themselves, they are not merged and lose, etc?
[12:49:53] <_genuser_> *not merged but overwritten
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> meaning if someone changes that seat var it those changes won't also happen in your object.
[12:50:19] <robertmaxrees> because JS does funny things with pass by reference, etc.
[12:50:40] <_genuser_> ah, I see. I'll have to keep an eye out for it.
[12:51:10] <_genuser_> in this case, it's formatSeat()'ing the object right before passing it thru a template processor and then adding it to the UI.
[12:51:40] <_genuser_> it's doing a .replaceWith on a <td> node, causing a huge node buildup and application crash in about 30minutes.
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> "causing a huge node buildup"?>
[12:54:20] <_genuser_> the application I'm tasked with fixing is a dashboard. updating data in realtime. building a new <td> element form template each time an update is sent and replacing the existing <td> node with the new one.
[12:54:48] <_genuser_> those aren't cleaned up fast enough by garbage collection, so it's a giant memory leak.
[12:54:55] <robertmaxrees> ah
[12:55:16] <_genuser_> I'm looking to see if I can understand the existing logic and then to a .html() and just provide the relevant data to the existing <td> node, instead of replacing it.
[12:56:20] <_genuser_> but not being a JS or a jQuery dev, I'm googling everything, lol.
[12:56:32] <robertmaxrees> no such thing as a "jquery dev" fwiw :)
[12:56:35] <robertmaxrees> it's all JS
[12:57:24] <Uhkis> i would say people developing jquery are jquery devs ;-)
[12:58:05] <robertmaxrees> fffffffff
[12:58:17] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[12:58:26] <_genuser_> I would just expect my manager to not ask me to kick out a new release in a couple of weeks on an app that was developed over 2 years and has a huge memory leak.
[12:59:06] <_genuser_> next week they expect me to change all the client-side rendering code to use "HTML5 Canvas object or SVG" instead. Just because they heard those terms.
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[12:59:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd swap over to react or riot or vue
[12:59:47] <_genuser_> oh yeah, someone suggested to him to use chart.js or react.js.
[12:59:57] <_genuser_> so the lead and manager pushed me to look into chart.js for a while.
[13:00:46] <_genuser_> but all those are completely new to me also. Learning? no problem. Kicking out a new release in 1-2 weeks? I mean just, wth!
[13:01:02] <Uhkis> that's some awful management :(
[13:03:32] <_genuser_> Uhkis: he said, "everyone's already working nights and weekends, why do you expect to have a lighter schedule."
[13:03:47] <_genuser_> you can't even argue with that kind of mindset
[13:03:51] <Uhkis> oh god
[13:03:57] <_genuser_> just do what the manager tells you, or you're wrong.
[13:03:59] <_genuser_> heh.
[13:04:07] <Uhkis> time to switch jobs
[13:04:24] <_genuser_> once the crunches are over, genreally it's a good place.
[13:07:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:31:30] <jak2000> the JAK-RUSSIAN returned!!!

[16:12:16] <SomeT> hi I am back lol
[16:14:43] <SomeT> so basically as per: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover I tried to change my code around which we were discussing the other day  to make the movien results more relevant: https://jsfiddle.net/jcudewxg/11/ so far I have this, if you look for example on line: 21 specifically feed.results.poster_path[0] I am trying to pick a random film ideally if anything the first film
[16:14:43] <SomeT> that is generated by APIurl in my code, I can't seem to get it to work where results is an array as per the api docs in the first link: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover
[16:16:49] <robertmaxrees> so what's your specific question?
[16:19:00] <robertmaxrees> also: you're getting CORS errors.
[16:19:44] <SomeT> I know
[16:19:51] <SomeT> cors errors usually resolve when I get it working
[16:19:54] <robertmaxrees> so you need to fix those firsdt.
[16:20:02] <robertmaxrees> otherwise nothing else will work.
[16:20:04] <SomeT> they usually fix themselves
[16:20:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:20:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/json-and-jsonp
[16:20:33] <SomeT> my specific question, is how do I get more relevant film results as in latest films and only show one of them
[16:20:38] <robertmaxrees> this is on a different domain, so you need to use JSONP
[16:20:39] <SomeT> the thing is my code works
[16:20:42] <SomeT> just not how I would like
[16:20:58] <robertmaxrees> hard to help if the fiddles doesn't work.
[16:21:00] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/jcudewxg/1
[16:21:12] <SomeT> here is a different version of the code that works but using a different part of the API
[16:21:24] <robertmaxrees> oh this.
[16:21:28] <robertmaxrees> i remembert this.
[16:21:29] <SomeT> my issue is more with the code dynamics of the API and how to garner the results part for discover park
[16:21:48] <SomeT> yeah so I done it like that initially improved the code a bit learned how it worked
[16:22:08] <SomeT> but now I need it to start bringing up more relevant films via https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover
[16:22:20] <SomeT> but doing it this way brings up many results at the same time
[16:22:31] <SomeT> so if you see: https://gyazo.com/c28fe7d3d06fc27dc2395bffc2723535
[16:22:42] <robertmaxrees> define "
[16:22:44] <SomeT> there is a way to only select one result by an array method
[16:22:57] <SomeT> but that array method I cant work out
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> "only select one result byu array method"??
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm so lost.
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> array[index].someprop
[16:25:01] <robertmaxrees> or are you asking how to make the API only return one movie?
[16:25:02] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/jcudewxg/11/
[16:25:06] <SomeT> so on line 21 of that fiddle
[16:25:13] <SomeT> we have: feed.results.poster_path[0]
[16:25:16] <SomeT> but this is not working
[16:25:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:25:21] <SomeT> I need to figure out how to fix
[16:25:42] <robertmaxrees> what is feed.results there?
[16:25:56] <robertmaxrees> (since the api call fails in that fiddle i have no idea.
[16:26:21] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want feed.results[0].poster_path
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> since feed.results is an array.
[16:26:39] <SomeT> yes exactly
[16:26:40] <SomeT> thanks
[16:26:45] <SomeT> I just need to talk this through haha
[16:26:48] <SomeT> thats so obvious now
[16:27:05] <robertmaxrees> also: https://i.imgur.com/mkH2aWh.png
[16:27:18] <robertmaxrees> your script tags should really go under "resources - jhust the src.
[16:27:28] <robertmaxrees> "resources" - *just the src, rather
[16:27:28] <SomeT> yeah sorry
[16:29:13] <daveee12_> I have a script that loads a bunch of html and javascript from another file, after the page loads, and the first time I get to the page I can inspect the html elements in chrome and see everything has been added, but it doesn’t actually appear on the page
[16:29:32] <robertmaxrees> daveee12_ we'd have to see it.
[16:29:44] <daveee12_> once i click a button that replaces the html and script that i just loaded, i see a flash of the table that was hidden
[16:29:50] <daveee12_> robertmaxrees: ok, one sec
[16:29:58] <SomeT> sounds like its updating constantly
[16:30:06] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be amazing for this.
[16:31:19] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: are fiddles free?
[16:31:26] <daveee123> got disconnected for a second
[16:31:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ yep
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> anyway so then I told taplar to go away
[16:31:53] <robertmaxrees> OH HEY TAPLAR
[16:31:58] <taplar> yo
[16:32:37] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: not sure it will work as a fiddle, it loads another file
[16:32:38] <daveee123> https://pastebin.com/kXEvFnBj
[16:32:38] <WALL-E> daveee123: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> woah what
[16:33:29] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[16:33:42] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[16:33:43] <robertmaxrees> so
[16:33:59] <robertmaxrees> you press the button, stuff shows up for a minute, then disappears?
[16:34:58] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: the reverse, when the pastebin is first loaded on the page, it should automarically load the $.get() statement into the tab
[16:35:16] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: but instead, i see nothing, until i click another tab. then for a second, i see all the content
[16:36:07] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: the content that was supposed to be seen on the first load. when i go back to the Scores tab, i can see the content when it loads the second time
[16:36:18] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="load-tabs-here"]').length);
[16:36:24] <robertmaxrees> ^ put this as the first thing in your doc ready.
[16:36:34] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[16:36:42] <robertmaxrees> also: the loading of extra JS seems... suspicious.
[16:38:22] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: i got 1
[16:38:28] <robertmaxrees> okay cool.
[16:38:55] <robertmaxrees> and it's not display: none; or anything like that, right?
[16:39:04] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: is loading extra JS a bad idea? is there a better way to request scripts than to just append it?
[16:39:08] <robertmaxrees> like, you have the tab "displaying"
[16:39:19] <robertmaxrees> daveee123 the page should have all the scripts it needs.
[16:39:26] <robertmaxrees> what else would you need to load onto the page?
[16:40:27] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: what do you mean "displaying"?
[16:40:43] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap?
[16:41:24] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: yes, using bootstrap 4
[16:41:31] <daveee123> also loading a bunch of datatables
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#fade-effect
[16:42:08] <robertmaxrees> actually https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/list-group/#fade-effect
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> "To make tabs panel fade in, add .fade to each .tab-pane. The first tab pane must also have .show to make the initial content visible."
[16:43:34] <daveee123> robertmaxrees: YES! than you!
[16:44:17] <daveee123> that was it, i left out "show" in the class of the "load-tabs-here" div
[16:45:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> s'why showing code is helpful/
[16:55:08] <taplar> fun times?
[16:59:37] <robertmaxrees> >:)
[17:41:13] <taplar> you ever did any indexeddb in a service worker?
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> not directly, no.
[17:44:03] <taplar> mmm.  i'm trying to figure out if there is a way to make the service worker wait for the db to initialize before firing the registered event.  otherwise I may have to pull the initialization out of it, but I kinda don't want to do that.  or figure out how to make the service worker push a notification to the client so that it knows the initializati
[17:44:03] <taplar> on is done.
[17:48:13] <taplar> it's been fun trying to figure out the non-promise stuff
[18:11:13] <ExeciN> Hi people? I'm trying to make a userscript. This is how far I got: https://gist.github.com/nicexe/b1208ee6ab0ffc4a2fe560adbb17d9e7
[18:11:22] <ExeciN> any idea on how can I get the values I need?
[18:13:51] <nikio_> how can i get the full url that will be called when using .ajax() ?
[18:14:26] <nikio_> or how can i prevent it from appending the websites root if you call it using an url that doesnt start with htto
[18:14:35] <nikio_> *http?
[18:16:05] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:16:16] <ExeciN> nikio_: if you use //:host.name/find/api/here then it will use the same protocol to reach it as the page
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> if you feed it a relative URL, it'll resolve it for you.
[18:16:55] <ExeciN> *I mean ://host...
[18:17:14] <nikio_> o.0
[18:17:22] <robertmaxrees> nikio_ what URL are you giving it?
[18:17:32] <robertmaxrees> like, are you omitting the protocol?
[18:17:36] <nikio_> im allowing the user to specify the url
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:18:06] <robertmaxrees> o... kay.  you'll have to validate it for them.
[18:18:20] <nikio_> i want the user to have full freedom
[18:18:29] <nikio_> but it has to be clear
[18:18:37] <nikio_> what is happening
[18:18:47] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.  so validate.
[18:18:47] <nikio_> therefo
[18:18:53] <robertmaxrees> it needs to start with http://
[18:18:55] <robertmaxrees> or just ://
[18:18:58] <nikio_> i dont need validation
[18:19:05] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:19:14] <nikio_> i neeed a way to get the actual url that gets called
[18:19:28] <robertmaxrees> are you serving your tool over https?
[18:19:38] <nikio_> or a way to prevent it from calling if the protocol is not specified, but i prefer the former
[18:19:45] <nikio_> yes
[18:19:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^ hence the validation.
[18:19:58] <robertmaxrees> and they HAVE to supply https:// or just ://
[18:20:00] <nikio_> so ajax has no solution for either cases?
[18:20:03] <robertmaxrees> since they can't do http
[18:20:26] <nikio_> .ajax
[18:20:42] <nikio_> the best option is just to get the actual url that will be called
[18:20:49] <nikio_> so the user sees what happns
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> since they can't call to http
[18:21:09] <nikio_> doesnt matter
[18:21:20] <nikio_> im showing them the response of that too
[18:21:24] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to look at the args passed to .then() and .catch()
[18:21:55] <robertmaxrees> but i'd provide validation instead so they don't have to watch the request fail./
[18:22:33] <nikio_> i want it all visible
[18:22:35] <nikio_> and full control
[18:22:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[18:22:46] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[18:25:48] <nikio_> dont be angry plz
[18:25:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[18:26:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm just giving up :)
[18:26:36] <nikio_> there is nothint go give up : p, its just my goal that i wanna reach
[18:26:39] <nikio_> am i not allowed?
[18:26:45] <robertmaxrees> i'
[18:27:02] <robertmaxrees> *i'm trying to explain that what you're trying to do would be better served by validating instead.
[18:27:03] <nikio_> im also overloading
[18:27:08] <nikio_> so i can barely type
[18:27:19] <robertmaxrees> for instance, you cannot use http:// for ajax from https pages
[18:27:21] <nikio_> worked from early morning till latenight, its 0:27 here
[18:27:37] <robertmaxrees> so the url needs to begin with either :// or https://
[18:27:50] <nikio_> i know
[18:28:07] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax isn't really the right tool to validate that.
[18:28:12] <nikio_> its a debugging tool
[18:28:13] <robertmaxrees> so validate before sending to $.ajax()
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> since $.ajax assumes that you're going to feed it a valid request.
[18:28:33] <nikio_> debugging tools should not be limiting, but empowering
[18:28:49] <nikio_> let the debugger decide what he does
[18:28:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:29:04] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use validation and throw errors and warnings.
[18:29:05] <nikio_> all he needs is to full control and a clear view of what happens when he tries things
[18:29:17] <robertmaxrees> then use the dev tools instead?
[18:29:29] <nikio_> including the raw response/error from sending an http request over https
[18:29:46] <robertmaxrees> except you can't access all that data via JS.
[18:30:05] <nikio_> i just want as much as possible
[18:30:23] <nikio_> as much as i can access
[18:30:48] <robertmaxrees> then learn to use your dev tools.
[18:30:53] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:31:15] <nikio_> i know how to use them, im just building this debug tool for something else
[18:31:31] <robertmaxrees> could you provide some more details about what you're building?
[18:32:08] <nikio_> a thing that allows to crud test and preview GIS layers for an OL Map
[18:32:29] <nikio_> but its build so that it can easily be extended to work with any GIS software
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> I thought the user was providing the full URL?
[18:32:43] <nikio_> yes
[18:32:47] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:32:50] <nikio_> the tool is an admining tool
[18:32:55] <nikio_> that allows you to create them
[18:32:57] <nikio_> crud them
[18:32:58] <nikio_> 4etc
[18:33:06] <robertmaxrees> erm
[18:33:08] <nikio_> a layer consists of many properties
[18:33:18] <nikio_> including an url
[18:33:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:33:27] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange tool.
[18:33:42] <nikio_> not really
[18:33:42] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to require that they supply a fully qualified url.
[18:33:48] <robertmaxrees> and not a dropdown.
[18:33:56] <nikio_> dropdown for what?
[18:34:02] <nikio_> what r u gonna fill it with?
[18:34:22] <robertmaxrees> Available services.
[18:34:36] <nikio_> how are you gonna add a new layer url?
[18:34:40] <robertmaxrees> you will.
[18:34:44] <robertmaxrees> via your backend.
[18:34:45] <nikio_> no
[18:34:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:34:50] <nikio_> thats what the tool is for
[18:34:59] <robertmaxrees> so you want to hold the end-users' hand but not.
[18:35:00] <nikio_> so someone who isnt a backend engineer can easily learn to do it
[18:35:21] <nikio_> its just like any other admining tool tbh
[18:35:27] <nikio_> like user managament
[18:35:29] <nikio_> in this case
[18:35:32] <nikio_> its layer management
[18:35:37] <nikio_> it has a preview
[18:35:38] <robertmaxrees> except frontend engineers should know how to do that as well.
[18:35:42] <nikio_> to and debug screen
[18:35:54] <robertmaxrees> what makes your tool different from postman?
[18:35:55] <nikio_> to see if the url responds with valid geojson
[18:35:56] <nikio_> or whaterver
[18:36:21] <nikio_> im overloading
[18:36:24] <nikio_> ill explain another time
[18:36:38] <robertmaxrees> no, you're not listening :)
[18:36:55] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*(
[18:47:07] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich is your GMT?
[18:47:14] <robertmaxrees> my time zone?
[18:47:38] <robertmaxrees> UTC-8
