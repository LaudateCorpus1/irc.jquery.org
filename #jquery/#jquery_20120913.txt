[00:17:52] <arielserafini> test
[00:22:44] <Already> failed. ;)
[00:23:17] <arielserafini> :/
[00:23:47] <arielserafini> test 2
[00:24:28] <Already> success.
[00:24:35] <arielserafini> indeed
[00:24:42] <arielserafini> just finished setting um znc
[00:25:14] <john2x> how do I perform the "default" after doing `e.preventDefault()` in a handler?
[00:27:57] <arielserafini> john2x: good question
[00:28:18] <blackspotwiggins> john2x, retrigger the event without doing preventdefault
[00:28:30] <arielserafini> that's what i was going to say
[00:30:26] <john2x> hmm doesn't seem to work, since the preventdefault is in the handler, when the handler is triggered again, it will just preventdefault again
[00:31:51] <john2x> what i'm trying to do is validate some fields when clicking on the form submit button
[00:32:05] <arielserafini> try using a parameter
[00:32:18] <arielserafini> to control that
[00:32:21] <john2x> in `$('form').on('submit')
[00:32:55] <Already> Maybe you're able to fire the element manually? Like $(this).trigger("click")?
[00:36:37] <Already> Oh and maybe you're able to just return true and false? Which seems to work as well. At least according to the doc at http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[00:36:53] <Already> So you just return false if it's not valid and true if it is.
[00:39:08] <Already> In case you'r still there john2x
[00:39:57] <john2x> Already: hmm what do you mean by just return true and false?
[00:42:47] <john2x> here's what I'm trying to do http://pastie.org/4712436
[00:43:04] <Already> Well if you look at the example on the api documentation page it seems to be sufficent to return true or false to decide whenever or not the default event should be fired, at least for .submit(). So instead of using .on() maybe using .submit() would solve your problem.
[00:44:34] <Already> you'd just change your $('form').trigger('submit'); to return true and add an return false after the if. At least that could work ... not sure if it does.
[00:45:31] <Already> or maybe you could even do a return validate_form();
[00:46:29] <john2x> ah yes, thanks Already. returning true/false proceeds with the submit or not.
[00:46:43] <blackspotwiggins> duh..
[00:46:57] <blackspotwiggins> you can just choose whether to do preventdefault or not

[01:28:26] <peetah> hi, any reason why the jquery blog RSS feed is not ana actual RSS feed anymore ?
[01:28:41] <peetah> s/ana/an/
[01:32:35] <tw2113> looks like it's served by feedburner
[01:35:25] <peetah> tw2113: it does not make it an RSS feed though, but the original html page
[01:35:47] <tw2113> *shrug*
[01:36:11] <tw2113> i'm just a partial lurker
[01:36:23] <peetah> ok
[01:36:54] <tw2113> one that needs to remember to hit save before uploading to the server
[01:40:14] <fRAiLtY-> How do I ensure it only address the p within itself? Using this? http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/8/
[01:42:47] <catery> please tell me there is a way to run an .exe console application from javascript
[01:44:21] <sgronblo> There is no way to build an element with jquery and have the data-attributes included in the result from .html() ?
[01:45:17] <peetah> catery: first result in your favorite search engine http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3152482/running-exe-from-javascript#3152512
[01:47:05] <catery> peetah: activex stuff won't work from chrome and firefox right?
[01:47:08] <fRAiLtY-> How can I use this in combination with the p tag in my query? http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/15/
[01:47:24] <fRAiLtY-> Instead of doing $('.divider-down p')
[01:48:36] <peetah> catery: second result in your favorite search engine... learn how to do your homework: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6472435/running-exe-in-firefox-why-do-i-get-an-error
[01:50:11] <nebmo88> hi, on line 2 in some versions of IE http://pastebin.com/iwZsQcWU it says 'object required', but i can't find anything wrong with it.
[01:50:40] <granden> Hi! Found this accordion-menu on the net. But got a question, would it be hard to modify it so that I can specify which item to be open when loading the page?
[01:56:30] <sgronblo> Is there no jquery way of getting a whole element as an html string instead of just the contents like .html does?
[02:03:32] <Cork> sgronblo: $('<div/>').html($(target).clone()).html()
[02:03:38] <catery> so the problem is that firefox 15 apparently makes that code not work anymore
[02:03:58] <catery> google says firefox 15 prevents that type of security thingy
[02:04:12] <Cork> sgronblo: theres no cross browser way of getting the outerhtml, so thats why you need to do that
[02:04:38] <Cork> catery: activex?
[02:04:44] <catery> that works for ie
[02:04:48] <Cork> that was dropped LOOOOONG ago
[02:04:50] <catery> how do i run exe for firefox
[02:05:06] <Cork> closer to ff1.5 then ff15...
[02:05:12] <catery> cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6177583/how-to-open-exe-with-javascript-xpcom-as-windows-run
[02:05:19] <catery> if i understand that doesn't work anymore for firefox
[02:05:27] <Cork> you can run it just fine
[02:05:32] <Cork> from an extension
[02:05:37] <catery> ugh
[02:05:41] <Cork> its not possible from web content
[02:05:44] <catery> that means every user of my website needs an extension
[02:05:53] <catery> and i haven't even solved the problem for chrome
[02:05:55] <Cork> and if you never found a way that would be a security hole
[02:06:29] <Cork> catery: you shouldn't ever implement an extension that lets sites run exe files
[02:06:32] <catery> so there is no cross browser way to let users of my website have their chess program interact with my site
[02:06:39] <Cork> thats a BIG security hole
[02:07:05] <Cork> the program can call a restfull url and post the data there
[02:07:14] <Cork> and you can push it to the browser
[02:07:18] <Cork> other then that, no
[02:08:11] <Cork> and i would very, very strongly recommend ageist trying to do it
[02:08:15] <blackspotwiggins> hah
[02:08:17] <blackspotwiggins> magical world
[02:08:19] <anli_> Tried to put this in the end of my apicontroller: var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, stream, new MediaTypeHeaderValue("image/png"));
[02:08:28] <john_c> exit
[02:08:29] <anli_> failed however
[02:08:31] <blackspotwiggins> people have no idea what they want would bring with it
[02:08:37] <Cork> anli_: still wrong channel :)
[02:08:41] <anli_> fuck
[02:08:42] <anli_> Sorry
[02:08:43] <Cork> lol
[02:08:44] <anli_> Must hide this one
[02:08:47] <anli_> :)
[02:10:12] <Cork> btw the recommend ageist wans't the push over server to browser
[02:10:18] <Cork> that ones safe
[02:10:31] <catery> Cork: can i get around the problem by having java applet run the exe
[02:10:52] <Cork> i'm sure you can
[02:11:06] <catery> so how can the browser let me do this with java
[02:11:06] <Cork> java have so much security holes that you can surely find an exploit
[02:11:26] <blackspotwiggins> ?xy @ catery
[02:11:27] <bot-t> catery, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[02:11:31] <Cork> catery: find an exploit vector in java to break out of the sandbox and execute locally
[02:11:46] <Cork> theres been two found the last 3 weeks :)
[02:11:57] <blackspotwiggins> running .exes from browser is a bad thing, period
[02:12:02] <Cork> yup
[02:12:04] <catery> I'm trying to let the user pick their own chess exe to run that interacts with the html page
[02:12:07] <blackspotwiggins> stop asking about it
[02:12:24] <catery> the user picks the exe so its ok for a big security pop up to show up in their face
[02:12:25] <Cork> catery: web security is all about preventing that
[02:12:38] <catery> you're sure that java won't allow this?
[02:12:42] <Cork> if you found a way thats a BIG bug
[02:12:45] <Cork> yes
[02:12:55] <Cork> java >APPLETS< won't allow that
[02:13:01] <Cork> and applets is what you use on the web
[02:13:10] <catery> is this legit http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6216024/java-applet-run-native-code-from-browser
[02:13:17] <catery> or is the answer bullshit
[02:13:45] <blackspotwiggins> oh ffs
[02:13:59] <blackspotwiggins> you are allowing the user to select a random exe and execute it from a webpage?
[02:14:01] <blackspotwiggins> are you insane?
[02:14:05] <Cork> you might be able to do it if the user accepts it
[02:14:08] <blackspotwiggins> ever heard of xss?
[02:14:17] <Cork> its a terrible idea ya
[02:14:26] <Cork> through and through
[02:14:36] <blackspotwiggins> and its not even related to jquery
[02:14:43] <catery> how is xss related to what i'm trying to do
[02:14:45] <blackspotwiggins> so go bother some gullible moron on ##php or smth
[02:14:48] <catery> PLEASE I NEED HELP
[02:14:48] <Cork> your going to open your server and the user up to a huge load of exploits
[02:15:20] <Cork> catery: cause someone can inject code into your page that makes the user download trojan.exe and executes it, or what ever
[02:15:53] <Cork> it breaks the concept of sandboxing the web from the local system
[02:16:08] <Cork> and that means all security goes out the window
[02:16:11] <catery> i'm interacting with the exe through stdout and stdin
[02:16:14] <catery> how is that gonna kill me
[02:16:37] <Cork> catery: so send an event from the webpage and let the host do the executing
[02:17:00] <Cork> as in the one running the web interface
[02:17:55] <Cork> but you never want a webpage remote or local have execution rights
[02:18:02] <Cork> *to have
[02:18:21] <catery> ok so if i role my own exe that goes through REST how do i do authentication crap
[02:18:36] <catery> i only know how to do stuff with rails
[02:18:47] <blackspotwiggins> maybe thats a good thing
[02:19:06] <Cork> when the app starts you enter credentials to connect with to basic auth of the server
[02:19:07] <blackspotwiggins> i imagine if you made a desktop app you'd want direct access to the power supply on the pc or smth
[02:19:12] <catery> you guys are depressing me, making me think that i have to go back to the old days of win32 api programs
[02:19:44] <Cork> catery: well you need to think about securing your interface
[02:20:38] <fRAiLtY-> How can I use this in combination with the p tag in my query? http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/15/ Instead of doing $('.divider-down p')
[02:21:47] <catery> ok what do you guys think of http://awesomium.com/
[02:21:55] <catery> can that be used to make a win32 app
[02:22:05] <catery> that doesn't just duplicate all the effort in the html version
[02:23:07] <sgronblo> Cork: yeh i ended up wrapping the div just like that
[02:23:36] <Cork> catery: thats just a minimalistic browser package
[02:23:40] <Cork> theres loads of them
[02:23:52] <Cork> both chrome and firefox has them built in for example
[02:24:09] <Cork> and i would expect them to have the same restrictions i just meantioned
[02:24:16] <fRAiLtY-> Look here: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/faq When you click the H2's all the p tags hide, I just want it to effect it's own div each time. http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/15/
[02:24:40] <peetah> catery: I fail to see how is all of this related to jquery ? could you explain ?
[02:24:49] <catery> peetah: I KNOW ITS UNRELATED
[02:25:04] <catery> I've just come to the conclusion that since I can't run exe from browser
[02:25:15] <catery> i have to revert back to the old days of making a win32 exe
[02:25:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $(this).closest('.divider-down').find('p').toggle()
[02:26:14] <peetah> fine then go back to your old days and stop polluting
[02:26:42] <Cork> catery: an alternative is to make your game into web based game
[02:26:46] <catery> peetah: i don't want to go back to win32 exe, so please help me find away to avoid it
[02:26:51] <Cork> then you can start it how ever you want
[02:27:10] <peetah> catery: how much do you pay ?
[02:27:11] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Thanks, works well. Can I include ul's in that .find() too?
[02:27:14] <Cork> catery: the problem isn't in not using win32 exe, its taht you want to use it
[02:27:14] <Lucky--> I'm building a single page web site . . . no not 1 page of content, but a reactive site that is havily reliant on ajax/json, and just manipulates the dom, anyone know of a good framework for things like "page change" so that I dont ahve to reinvent the wheel?
[02:27:15] <catery> the user has to choose which chess engine Rybka, Houdini they want to use
[02:27:17] <catery> its not a game
[02:28:00] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: all it does is start from the clicked tag, find the closest "divider-down" parent, and find the elements inside it you want to hide
[02:28:18] <catery> I would like the user to be able to choose a chess engine like Rybka and then my html site can use it to analyze a bunch of positions display them and save the results to a database
[02:28:22] <catery> so the user can view them later
[02:28:49] <catery> is there anyway to make this work???
[02:28:51] <Cork> catery: then you need something to interface with the server
[02:28:51] <catery> IDEAS PLEASE I BEG YOU
[02:28:53] <blackspotwiggins> you know its totally unrelated to this channel and yet you keep asking us about it
[02:29:00] <blackspotwiggins> please go
[02:29:19] <catery> Cork: interface with what server
[02:29:29] <Cork> and yes, its not js related, as that won't ever be possible
[02:29:55] <Cork> so go ask someone for help with server + win32 app interaction
[02:30:25] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/16/ Nearly there, can I ensure all <p> tags are hidden on page load, so toggle is show/hide rather than hide/show?
[02:30:28] <catery> you are saying this is not possible in js at all for sure: the user chooses a chess engine like Rybka and then my html site can use it to analyze a bunch of positions and save the result in a database
[02:31:26] <peetah> catery: do you have any clue how the web is working ? I don't think so, so go learning and come back then
[02:31:49] <catery> peetah: ok i'm sorry i was just hoping there would be a way to do this with html
[02:32:02] <blackspotwiggins> html is a markup language
[02:32:10] <catery> html +js +css
[02:32:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: just run a selector on page load/dom ready and hide them
[02:32:14] <blackspotwiggins> you cant analyze chess games with markup languages
[02:32:27] <blackspotwiggins> YES CSS IS WHAT YOU NEED GO FOR IT
[02:33:46] <peetah> html describes what you want to display, css describes how you want to display it, js describes how you can interact with your content: the web is the web, your desktop applications are something else
[02:34:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: btw your running a selector thats un needed
[02:34:21] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $(this).closest('.divider-down').find('p, ul').toggle(); should do the same as what your doing
[02:34:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/18/
[02:35:06] <Iszak> massimo_palmieri!!
[02:35:27] <Cork> Fr3d: yup, though all the code in the box already runs on load so no need to wait for ready ;)
[02:35:45] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  How do you mean?
[02:36:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4KRzR/19/
[02:36:15] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the dropdown on the left was on "onload"
[02:40:30] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, it hide's all <p>'s on the page lol
[02:40:52] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: in what relation is it you want to hide them?
[02:41:25] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Look at this page now: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/faq
[02:41:37] <fRAiLtY-> Click the headings down below the top BS, you'll see the content hides
[02:41:43] <fRAiLtY-> I want it to be hidden to start with
[02:41:50] <fRAiLtY-> except all P's then hide, i.e. the footer, the headers etc
[02:43:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: so add ".main" to the selector
[02:43:49] <fRAiLtY-> Nope, now look http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/faq
[02:43:55] <fRAiLtY-> Footer and bits in header etc gone :x
[02:47:14] <clu3> guys, i'm trying to .ajax submit an array as the value but somehow the object doesn't get submited, any help pls
[02:47:16] <clu3> http://pastebin.com/UtPZMMV6
[02:47:50] <Cork> clu3: thats not an array
[02:47:56] <fRAiLtY-> Cork ^^
[02:48:06] <Cork> your creating an object and converting that to an object
[02:48:17] <Cork> sorry your creating an array and converting that to an object
[02:48:29] <Cork> something you should never do
[02:48:45] <fRAiLtY-> me?
[02:48:48] <Cork> no
[02:48:51] <Cork> clu3
[02:48:54] <fRAiLtY-> Oh
[02:49:00] <fRAiLtY-> Adding main didn't work :x
[02:49:04] <clu3> yep, i've always done something like that and ajaxForm is able to convert that, but with .ajax() it doesn't work
[02:49:20] <Cork> clu3: your missing the point
[02:49:29] <Cork> you creating an object so use an object
[02:49:46] <Cork> var details = {}; not details = [];
[02:50:04] <Cork> clu3: whats the structure you want to send like?
[02:50:42] <Cork> btw you should A-L-W-A-Y-S define your variables
[02:50:43] <clu3> ok, i might have made a wrong pastebin. i wanna send an array of objects. So that 'a', 'b' could have been mistaken
[02:51:12] <clu3> each object is simple like {score: 1, start:2}
[02:51:27] <Cork> no those are the inner objects
[02:51:46] <Cork> i'm talking about what the structure you want to send to the server should be like
[02:51:51] <clu3> details = simple array of those objects (No associative or what ever)
[02:52:17] <clu3> Cork, i'm not sure yet, i just wanna send this array to server, at the server i can adapt, but currently i'm not able to send it yet
[02:52:59] <Cork> so you want nid=1&details[][score]=10&details[][start]=1&details[][score]=8&details[][start]=2 ?
[02:53:57] <fRAiLtY-> Ahaa, Cork  if I do   $('.divider-down p').hide();  it works, doesn't hide all the <p> just the ones I want, but if I do   $('.divider-down p,ul').hide(); it hides nearly everything
[02:54:09] <Cork> ah
[02:54:24] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you know how css selectors work right?
[02:54:38] <clu3> Cork, i just tried replacing details={} with details=[] and it works, thanks
[02:54:39] <Cork> if you do why that happens should be obvious :)
[02:55:00] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I thought I did lol
[02:55:20] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $('.divider-down p,ul').hide() is the same as:
[02:55:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $('.divider-down p').hide()
[02:55:37] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $('ul').hide()
[02:55:57] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, so I need to do .divider-down p, .divider-down ul ?
[02:56:04] <Cork> right
[02:56:15] <blackspotwiggins> or $("p, ul", ".divider-down")
[02:56:37] <Cork> or $('.divider-down').find('p, ul')
[02:56:38] <Cork> :)
[02:56:57] <Cork> the first one is faster though
[02:57:03] <Cork> $('.divider-down p, .divider-down ul')
[02:57:41] <Cork> (as the browser can do that in one go, with no filtering needed in js)
[02:59:50] <Deviad> Hello, is there any way to modify Easytabs so that it accepts links coming from different places than <div class="tab-container">
[02:59:51] <blackspotwiggins> hmm
[03:00:06] <blackspotwiggins> i wonder if $("p,ul").filter() would be faster or slower than find
[03:00:17] <Cork> slower
[03:00:23] <Cork> your doing the filtering in js
[03:00:27] <Deviad> I want to use easytabs because it implements the hashchange plugin.
[03:00:30] <blackspotwiggins> so is find() ?
[03:00:35] <Cork> partly
[03:00:41] <Cork> but not all the way
[03:00:43] <blackspotwiggins> ah, k
[03:00:55] <Deviad> I wasn't able to do make work Hashchange with my implementation of tabs...
[03:01:08] <Deviad> to do work*
[03:01:34] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: find takes each dom element in the array and does dom.querySelector()
[03:01:56] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: then it merges those arrays and - removes duplicate elements
[03:02:04] <blackspotwiggins> makes sense
[03:02:14] <Cork> but all that is is referencing the dom id
[03:02:19] <Cork> so its cheap
[03:02:45] <Cork> (not the attribute id, but the dom element uniq id)
[03:03:10] <blackspotwiggins> forgot about the dom.queryselector()
[03:04:05] <Cork> that "cheap" goes out the window if your using subselectors though
[03:04:10] <clu3> Cork, i've always thought (for 4 years of web dev) that Javascript would treat an associative array as a normal object. I'm still puzzled why details=[] doesn't work
[03:04:42] <Cork> clu3: an array inherits from object
[03:04:43] <blackspotwiggins> there is no associative array in js
[03:04:51] <Cork> but and object isn't an array :)
[03:05:11] <Cork> and ya an array can't have jumps or associative strings
[03:05:29] <blackspotwiggins> pretty weird that you dont know it after 4 years, clu3
[03:05:47] <Cork> so var a = []; a[4] = 'val'; is actually var a = [undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,'val'];
[03:06:27] <clu3> yep, but if a['4'] = 'val', it should be like a = {'4' : 'val'} shoudlnt it
[03:06:37] <Cork> so if you ever want to do something you can't do with .push/.shift/unshift/pop you shouldn't be using an array
[03:06:41] <Cork> no
[03:06:43] <blackspotwiggins> wtf
[03:06:43] <clu3> blackspotwiggins, i know, and i'm not a bad js coder either, it's weird
[03:07:01] <blackspotwiggins> no it should not change to an objectm agically
[03:07:04] <Cork> clu3: the first is a broken array like object
[03:07:10] <Cork> the second is just a pure object
[03:07:41] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  So to confirm, which way is fastest?
[03:07:44] <Cork> clu3: the first one has a length that isn't garanteed to be correct, and things like htat
[03:08:01] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: $('.divider-down p, .divider-down ul')
[03:08:18] <fRAiLtY-> Cool, that's what I'm using
[03:08:20] <fRAiLtY-> n1 thanks
[03:08:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but if your using :<selectors> the speed difference goes out the window
[03:08:46] <Cork> like :input or :animated and the like
[03:10:03] <Cork> and to be clear same with :focus, :active, :selected too
[03:10:58] <competencia123> hi there guys
[03:11:34] <competencia123> is there a method for handling no results on autocomplete? I've google it but... I don't find anything
[03:12:01] <Cork> competencia123: check for when the result data is .length < 1
[03:13:22] <Lucky--> what was the official replacement for jquery templates?
[03:13:35] <Cork> as far as i know there isn't one yet
[03:13:45] <Cork> one is on its way in jquery-ui
[03:13:55] <blackspotwiggins> use whatever templating you like
[03:14:00] <Lucky--> wasnt ther elike renderjs
[03:14:01] <Lucky--> or something
[03:14:02] <blackspotwiggins> why do you care if it's "official"
[03:14:05] <Cork> but they starting from a package closer to jqote2 last i checked
[03:14:29] <Cork> (that said was months ago)
[03:14:46] <clu3> Cork, ok thanks for clearing up,also i've found an article on  "Associative" array, funny i've never noticed that
[03:14:49] <competencia123> Cork: but with method? I tried parse but it doesn't works
[03:15:03] <competencia123> and select doesn't work if no results
[03:15:57] <Navyman> Hello, I have 6 Racks with hardware inside to sell, from IBM Server x3650 to routers ciscos, and optical fiber switch brocade. If someone is interested, I make a good bulk price. PM me.
[03:16:15] <blackspotwiggins> Navyman, can you hook me up with a flamethrower?
[03:16:23] <Cork> competencia123: ugg doesn't apper to be one (i haven't migrated to jquery-ui's autocomplete yet)
[03:16:25] <blackspotwiggins> or maybe like a really large cannon
[03:16:41] <Cork> i'm still on the old autocomplete plugin, and it had a nice preprocessor that was called
[03:16:56] <Navyman> blackspotwiggins: of course
[03:17:01] <competencia123> oh, ok thanks :S
[03:17:34] <Cork> competencia123: a tip though open an unminimized version of autocomplete and check it source
[03:17:41] <Cork> you might be able to find a way to do it
[03:17:46] <Cork> there usually is :)
[03:17:57] <Cork> might need to write it as a plugin extension though
[03:18:13] <competencia123> the horror!!
[03:18:16] <competencia123> hehe
[03:18:23] <competencia123> thanks for tip
[03:18:28] <Cork> its not that hard :)

[03:23:54] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:24:17] <jomofcw> Using the colorbox plugin, I cant' understand why it create two "colorbox" ? I see those in the DOM using firebug.
[03:38:36] <Alvo> hi, i have jquery, and i load a bigger textfile with $.ajax(), and i would like to see a progress with how many bytes have been transferred (downloaded), how do i do that?
[03:42:12] <softmanpetro> is this ok ? $('input[@type=text]').each(function()
[03:42:38] <xec> what's the @ for?
[03:42:48] <softmanpetro> have no ideea
[03:43:37] <xec> okay... so what is it supposed to do?
[03:43:43] <softmanpetro> I try to set all inputs $(this).toggleClass('width400');
[03:43:54] <softmanpetro> on document ready
[03:48:18] <shiftingcontrol> I did $(html_form).modal('show'), now my keyboard input isn't detected, https://gist.github.com/3713537
[03:53:39] <greek> Heya fellas. I've successfully connected a draggable to one sortable using element IDs. Now I'm trying to connect the same draggable to multiple sortables using classes. It's not working. It might be something else I've overlooked, but I just wanted to check that this is at all possible (ie: connecting one draggable to multiple sortables)? Thanks
[04:01:25] <greek> Ah ok I've gotten it to work. So yeah, classes works.
[04:08:13] <Navyman> Hello, I have 6 Racks 42U with hardware inside to sell, from IBM Server x3650 to routers ciscos, and optical fiber switch Brocade. If someone is interested, I make a good bulk price. PM me.
[04:15:18] <subdesign> is it possible to reach emelent last-child() - 1
[04:23:24] <xec> subdesign: :nth-last-child(2) should do the trick
[04:23:24] <xec> subdesign: if you wanted the second last child?
[04:23:38] <subdesign> yes
[04:23:56] <subdesign> thanks
[04:41:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  You around?
[04:41:50] <Cork> sure
[04:42:19] <fRAiLtY-> Here: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/faq If you look when you click one of the h2's a little arrow image appears beside, how can I exclude this from the hide initially?
[04:44:11] <Cork> fRAiLtY-:  $('.divider-down p, .divider-down ul, .divider-down h1, .divider-down img').not('h2 img')
[04:45:17] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: better option would prob be to put everything below the h2 tag in a wrapper div
[04:45:23] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and hide that div
[04:45:31] <Cork> that would make everything much cleaner
[04:45:48] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: btw a bit off-topic, <center> is depricated >_>
[04:46:50] <BlaDe^> i've built a plugin and I pass a parameter like: offset: $('#pofileCollections article').not('#addCollection').length,
[04:47:10] <BlaDe^> how can I make that expression get re-evaluated each time it is used?
[04:47:17] <BlaDe^> kind of like a pointer
[04:47:36] <Cork> offset: '#pofileCollections article:not(#addCollection)'
[04:47:48] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Thankfully it's not my code, I spent all morning correcting <p> tags as the "coder" wasn't aware of closing </p> tags
[04:47:52] <Cork> ... $(obj.offset).length
[04:47:55] <Navyman> Hello, I have 6 Racks 42U with hardware inside to sell, from IBM Server x3650 to routers ciscos, and optical fiber switch Brocade. If someone is interested, I make a good bulk price. PM me.
[04:48:00] <fRAiLtY-> I'm just doing this bit to get him off my back :D
[04:48:09] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: OUCH
[04:48:17] <BlaDe^> Cork: what about offset: function () { return $(..).length; }, will that work
[04:48:29] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: yes
[04:48:32] <Cork> opps
[04:48:34] <Cork> BlaDe^: ^
[04:48:58] <BlaDe^> Cork:  would you recommend either one particularly? i think the latter would be more future proofed for different scenarios
[04:49:02] <blackspotwiggins> someone ban Navyman plox
[04:49:14] <jeffsmykil> Anyone have any good articles that touch upon handlebars workflow?
[04:49:38] <Dr4g> Guys, I implemented smooth anchor scrolling on my documentation - it works in my safari/firefox but not in my Chrome - can someone test for me? http://dev.ppi.io/docs/routing.html#details
[04:49:39] <Dr4g> open the Table of Contents at the bottom and start clicking links, it should smooth-scroll to anchors
[04:50:00] <Cork> BlaDe^: both are as future safe
[04:50:22] <Cork> BlaDe^: and it all depends on the situation
[04:50:23] <BlaDe^> Cork: not if I didn't always want it to be a .length attribute dictating the offset
[04:50:31] <BlaDe^> property*
[04:50:55] <Cork> then yes if you want to have a callback to get the number you want, then yes you need a callback :)
[04:51:24] <BlaDe^> Cork: offset: function() { return $('#pofileCollections article:not(#addCollection)').length; }, is giving me undefined
[04:51:34] <Cork> though thats a fairly simple change to do so future safe doesn't really matter there
[04:51:55] <Cork> BlaDe^: what gives you undefined?
[04:52:08] <BlaDe^> before I was getting a fixed 12, now i see undefined
[04:52:12] <BlaDe^> (I'm just watching the xhr request parameters)
[04:52:24] <Cork> and your running obj.offset() now?
[04:52:54] <Cork> BlaDe^: btw if you don't want to send a string use .not instead of :not if possible
[04:53:17] <Cork> sub-selectors are costly in selectors
[04:53:57] <BlaDe^> Cork:  it's basically for infinite scrolling, and I just pass $.ajax({data:filters}) where filters in this case has offset: function() { return $(..).length; }
[04:54:05] <BlaDe^> but using the closure is giving undefined
[04:54:16] <BlaDe^> before I was just using $(..).length but of course that was a static value
[04:54:25] <Dr4g> Dudes, can you click test my links for me once you figure out your problem?
[04:54:29] <Cork> BlaDe^: that won't work
[04:54:31] <jeffsmykil> What year is this?  Im still installing shit from the command line
[04:54:37] <Cork> you can't serialize a function
[04:54:56] <Cork> BlaDe^: so you need to run offset as a function and user the response value
[04:55:19] <BlaDe^> Dr4g: what do you want me to click, seems to work in chrome here
[04:55:43] <Dr4g> BlaDe^: did the page smooth-scroll to #details upon page load?
[04:55:54] <Dr4g> Did the page smooth-scroll upon clicking Table of Contents links ?
[04:55:56] <BlaDe^> Dr4g:  not sure about smooth, but it anchored there sure
[04:56:05] <BlaDe^> the table of contents pops out smoothly
[04:56:17] <Dr4g> BlaDe^: the actual clicking of the links though.
[04:56:17] <BlaDe^> Cork: i guess i'll make a callback to fetch filters everytime it's called then
[04:56:18] <jeffsmykil> is precompiling templates really necessary?
[04:56:27] <BlaDe^> Dr4g:  nope that doesn't work
[04:56:43] <Dr4g> BlaDe^: does it work in another browser for you, can you check please ? :)
[04:57:23] <BlaDe^> no other browsers on this machine, sorry
[04:57:32] <Dr4g> BlaDe^: alright, thanks dude.
[05:02:39] <BlaDe^> Cork:  i just changed it to filters() where filters is function() { return { ... }; } instead of just an obj like before
[05:02:53] <BlaDe^> seems to work fine, and you think in such a case I should use .not vs :not?
[05:09:02] <d4ndy> Hello
[05:09:31] <d4ndy> When processing multiple file uploads, how does one reference the current file position in the array?
[05:09:41] <d4ndy> ie, I need to reference file #2 or 5 or whatever
[05:10:07] <Dr4g> d4ndy: i don't know in-depth but it should be an array, and you should be able to use a variable like " i " as a counter
[05:12:36] <rns> is there a better way to do this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764183/submit-unmasked-form-value-with-jquery-meiomask
[05:13:24] <rns> I am trying to submit a form after formatting the text field as currency, but I'd like the form to actually submit the numerical value (1000 instead of '$1,000')
[05:14:19] <d4ndy> dr4g: thank you
[05:14:46] <Purveyor> rns - yeah, put the value you care about in a hidden <input> and just discard the one that's there for the user
[05:15:02] <Purveyor> The same method that reformats it can populate the hidden input
[05:15:30] <jomofcw> receiving the AJAX data in a ajax.success function, when I do $('<div/>').append(data); it seems to load eahc javascript of the data oO... why plz ?
[05:24:16] <mbrevda> how do I pass a function name as an option in jquery ui?
[05:24:41] <EweR> trying to make a click function on <td> to change it to text field, no luck http://pastie.org/4713563
[05:24:46] <mbrevda> i.e. $(foo).dragable({optionTitle: FUNCTION_NAME_HERE}) <--- does it need to be quoted? do I call it as function_name()?
[05:25:59] <Cork> mbrevda: function_name_here() yes
[05:26:12] <Cork> mbrevda: that won't pass the function though, but the result from the function
[05:27:24] <Cork> EweR: why not just $(this).html('<input type="text" value="' + $(this).text() + '>'); ?
[05:27:36] <Cork> ops
[05:27:43] <Cork> EweR: * why not just $(this).html('<input type="text" value="' + $(this).text() + '">'); ?
[05:28:00] <EweR> Cork: seems legit
[05:28:27] <esiegel> Cork, EweR, you might need to pull the text into a variable before changing the HTML.
[05:28:37] <Cork> nope
[05:28:51] <Cork> your useing the result from .text() to generate a new string
[05:28:55] <esiegel> Cork, alright, wasn't sure of the order.
[05:28:59] <Cork> that string is then parsed to dom and added to the parent
[05:29:26] <Cork> so you don't lose the text until before you grab it :)
[05:29:31] <Cork> -until
[05:30:25] <mbrevda> thanks Cork
[05:30:30] <Cork> np
[05:30:39] <mbrevda> Cork: I want the function to be run
[05:31:04] <Cork> mbrevda: sure, the reason i asked is for when you want it run :)
[05:31:27] <Cork> when you set the value in the object, or when the title is set later in the function
[05:31:28] <mbrevda> how would I pass the actual function then?
[05:31:29] <rns> Purveyor, thanks.  Is there a way to do this in jquery on submit?
[05:31:46] <Cork> mbrevda: the function has to be able to handle that for you do be able to
[05:32:03] <Cork> it has to check if the variable is a function and if so run it
[05:32:21] <Cork> if it doens't have that code, you can't pass a function
[05:32:28] <shoky> EweR: donno if someone replied to you already, but, your code works fine
[05:32:35] <shoky> aw jeez what a lag
[05:33:09] <Cork> shoky: the network is a bit choppy at the moment :)
[05:34:12] <shoky> aye ;]
[05:35:01] <mbrevda> Cork: how would I pass the actual function?
[05:35:11] <Cork> just the function name
[05:35:26] <EweR> shoky: then i guess its something else, cause click function is not working at all on elements in my page idk why
[05:36:08] <Cork> ?eval var name = function() { return 'hello'; };  var a = {};  a.title = name; console.log(a.title());
[05:36:22] <Cork> <_<
[05:36:28] <shoky> EweR: did you put it in a $(document).ready  ?
[05:36:58] <EweR> shoky: oh, makes sense *doh*
[05:39:04] <mbrevda> right - I want it run every time the even is reached
[05:39:50] <Cork> mbrevda: then the ones that use the value needs to be function aware, like i said
[05:39:58] <Cork> else it doesn't work
[05:40:25] <Cork> you could generate a getter, but that doens't work in ie
[05:40:46] <mbrevda> so can I do optaionName: function(){my_function();} ?
[05:41:05] <Cork> if you mean return my_function() sure
[05:41:19] <Cork> if the user of optainName runs optianName()
[05:41:23] <Cork> :)
[05:41:35] <BlaDe^> mbrevda: are you trying to achieve dynamic parameters?
[05:42:07] <Cork> mbrevda: you have to options, the user knows how to handle functions, or define a getter
[05:42:21] <Cork> the first one needs support, the second has limited browser support
[05:48:46] <EweR> how can I affect on click the elements which are within the same parent element as the button that is clicked? as in <tr><td><p>sometext</p></td><td><button></td></tr>  for example clicking the button will make all the <p> elements change to text input
[05:48:51] <RPkS> I want to use a "Read More" link that will make the page jump further down the screen to the same place on each product page. What's the most efficent/smart way to go about that? I've been Googling for a while, but there are so many choices.
[05:50:47] <brookquint> What is the best way to return an array from ajax to javascript?
[05:52:36] <boulet101010> [elt1, elt2, elt3]
[05:52:57] <boulet101010> are the elements of the array of the same type?
[05:54:52] <brookquint> boulet101010 they are from a mysql query
[05:55:41] <brookquint> its the result of a query so the indexes are the column names, right no I have a var_dump in the ajax call but I just realized thats why it's not rifht
[05:55:48] <boulet101010> ok so what is the types of the fields in the mysql table?
[05:56:29] <brookquint> how do I return an array in the ajax called php file? the fields are credit card info
[05:57:08] <brookquint> unsigned int's, varchar's, enum's
[05:57:18] <computer2000> hey there. im trying to figure out a possibility to make the trackpad scrolling slower on a page, like by reducing the scroll-delta, before doing the scroll. anyone got an idea how that could be done?
[05:57:47] <BlaDe^> brookquint:  json_encode, but it's a php question really
[05:58:05] <brookquint> ok I was thinking JSON but I've never used it before
[05:58:42] <Navyman> Hello, I have 6 Racks 42U with hardware inside to sell, from IBM Server x3650 to routers ciscos, and optical fiber switch Brocade. If someone is interested, I make a good bulk price. PM me.
[06:00:17] <boulet101010> it's not exactly an array so
[06:01:32] <boulet101010> it's an object that you're converting into a JSON string that you will reconvert into an object in JS through JSON.parse(result)
[06:07:36] <brookquint> boulet101010 now that I have var card = JSON.parse(info); now card is an object. how do I go through it?
[06:10:59] <boulet101010> info.property = value
[06:12:01] <brookquint> yes realized it was object not array index
[06:12:07] <brookquint> thanks

[06:22:58] <rhino__>  hey guys, I'm working w/ javascriptand I'm trying to modify the following regex to allow for an optional 0 bfore the period, but that is the only situation where a leading 0 is allowed.  /^([1-9]\d{0,3}(\.\d{1,2})?|\.\d{1,2})$/ Any ideas??
[06:24:34] <pachet> horn of beelzebub, that regex is ugly
[06:26:24] <pachet> rhino__: try asking in #regex
[06:26:57] <rhino__> pachet:  I have and no one is even talking over there
[06:27:24] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  You still here? LD
[06:29:31] <pachet> rhino__: morning just starting for us stateside folks, give it an hour and things should pick up
[06:30:02] <rhino__> pachet:  I am stateside
[06:30:07] <rhino__> lol
[06:31:41] <RPkS> Okay, I found a nice smooth scrolling jquery effect to use, but I don't need the "nudge" effect in my case. osvaldas.info/examples/more-noticeable-html-bookmarks/
[06:33:31] <RPkS> Here is the details of the code, but I'm not sure what to remove exactly from the first piece of code since it has "nudge" listed in the code. http://osvaldas.info/more-noticeable-html-bookmarks
[06:36:39] <shoky> rhino__: so why not just add the optional 0 ?   /^([1-9]\d{0,3}(\.\d{1,2})?|0?\.\d{1,2})$/
[06:37:24] <jamesw> hi all
[06:38:09] <pachet> jamesw: hi
[06:38:31] <jamesw> i have a game where i am using an animate() call, and I would like to make this animation faster depending on other game events, how can I change the delay of an in-progress animation?
[06:39:29] <rhino__> shoky:  thanks for the idea, but  0.25 still fails the test
[06:39:46] <shoky> rhino__ no it doesn't
[06:40:32] <pachet> jamesw: if you don't feel like delving too deeply into the mechanics of the animate effects queue and such, then you should just .stop() the current animation and call .animate() again with the updated speed/parameters
[06:40:57] <jamesw> rhino__: , shoky, is it possible your build environments differ enough to cause the test to fail?
[06:41:34] <jamesw> thanks pachet
[06:43:00] <greek> Heya fellas. Is it possible to .bind(...) an event to an item that hasn't been loaded into the DOM tree yet? Kinda like how one would use .on(...) to delegate a binding to a .click() event etc.
[06:43:00] <mvk> i have a Ul called #something, now in the ul there are a few LI's, which get a class="selected" when they are selected...
[06:43:29] <shoky> jamesw: sure it's possible.. but i doubt it ;p
[06:43:32] <mvk> how do i bind a function(){ } to the li's when they get the class 'selected', so i can perform some action?
[06:43:56] <greek> No, wait, I think I see the light
[06:44:03] <rhino__> shoky:  just implemented /^([1-9]\d{0,3}(\.\d{1,2})?|0?\.\d{1,2})$/ in my code and 0.25 fails every time
[06:44:43] <shoky> rhino__:  /^([1-9]\d{0,3}(\.\d{1,2})?|0?\.\d{1,2})$/.test( '0.25' )   doesn't return true?
[06:45:01] <isnnnn> is there a way to get all the selected input boxes from a UI dialog window (input boxes loaded from an ajax call)
[06:45:34] <pachet> greek: you sorta answered your own question -- try .on()
[06:45:40] <mvk> or to put it differently, when my ul.li gets the class="selected" how do i bind to this event?
[06:45:43] <greek> pachet yeah :) thanks anyway
[06:45:56] <rhino__> shoky:  how would I use the .test to test it?
[06:46:00] <sekyms> So in handlebars I dont like that you have to have <script> tags inline doesn;t this defeat the purpose of reusability?
[06:46:07] <shoky> rhino__: look in the console?
[06:46:30] <shoky> rhino__: i mean, run it in the console..
[06:46:41] <shoky> or in your code and console.log it , or whatever..
[06:46:58] <Iszak> rhino__go back to #regex we'll help you...
[06:46:58] <pachet> isnnnn: after the loaded elements have been added to the dom: $('#my_ui_window input:selected')
[06:47:37] <greek> Ok so my next question... to initialise a sortable, I have to go $("#sortable").sortable(); however I haven't loaded my sortable into the DOM tree yet. So how do I delay (delegate?) the initialisation of a sortable? pachet perhaps you see where I'm coming from?
[06:48:53] <pachet> greek: well, there are ways of doing that, but they're clunky
[06:49:11] <pachet> if it's at all possible i'd recommend just binding to the elements in your ajax callback
[06:49:15] <greek> pachet, hmm I figure it might be best to just initialise it as and when I load the sortable into the dom tree then
[06:49:19] <greek> yeah exactly
[06:49:28] <rhino__> shoky:  I'm currently doing this  if (!ptmedvals[1].match(/^([1-9]\d{0,3}(\.\d{1,2})?|0?\.\d{1,2})$/)){alert('not a match');} and it fails
[06:49:29] <greek> ok thanks again
[06:49:37] <pachet> if that's absolutely not an option, you can delegate some arbitrary event to check whether the plugin has been initialized for that element
[06:51:02] <pachet> greek: eg: $('#container').on('click.mynamespace', '.foo', function ( ) { if ( ! $(this).data('bar_loaded') ) { $(this).bar().trigger('click'); });
[06:51:30] <Iszak> rhino__ /^(?:([1-9]\d{0,3}|0)(\.\d{1,2}))$/
[06:51:45] <Iszak> ?v8 /^(?:([1-9]\d{0,3}|0)(\.\d{1,2}))$/.test('1.0')
[06:51:51] <Iszak> I can never remember the bot.
[06:53:18] <fRAiLtY-> Why doesn't my <td> select and addClass on the 1st select. The ID is correct :x http://jsfiddle.net/e9HL2/10/
[06:54:19] <shoky> rhino__: this alerts for you? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/QghY7/
[06:57:44] <pachet> ?eval 'charizard' @ Iszak
[06:57:51] <Iszak> thanks
[06:58:10] <pachet> er, apparently the bot can't remember the bot, either
[06:58:15] <pachet> but when it's up, that's the trigger
[06:58:58] <greek> pachet++ thanks so much that works perfectly
[06:59:19] <pachet> greek: no sweat :]
[06:59:25] <brian__> anyone familiar with bxSlider?
[06:59:36] <pachet> ?eval 'late to the party'
[06:59:51] <pachet> bleh
[06:59:54] <shoky> heh
[06:59:57] <brian__> trying to detect on form submit the current slide that they have selected
[07:00:50] <rrrrrrrrr> deneme,
[07:01:07] <rhino__> Iszak:  yours works except that I also need to be able to enter up to number that are between 1 and 4 aharacters in length and that doesn't start w/ a zero
[07:01:11] <brian__> http://pastebin.com/B1aYMnGt
[07:01:13] <brian__> that's what I have right now
[07:01:24] <Iszak> rhino__, give me an example.
[07:01:33] <brian__> I know that'll return just the index, but stuck at this point. not sure where to go next if anyone could lend a hand..
[07:03:52] <fRAiLtY-> Why doesn't my <td> select and addClass on the 1st select. The ID is correct :x http://jsfiddle.net/e9HL2/10/
[07:04:35] <rhino__> Iszak:  the following shoulf work, disregard the commas as they are just seperators 2, 56, 296, 1000
[07:05:13] <Iszak> hmmm
[07:05:46] <Iszak> ?eval /^(?:([1-9]\d{0,4}|0)(\.\d{1,2})?)$/.test(2)
[07:05:48] <Iszak> err
[07:06:31] <Iszak> rhino__ /^(?:([1-9]\d{0,3}|0)(\.\d{1,2})?)$/ should do it.
[07:06:45] <Iszak> although simply 0 will match, is this okay?
[07:09:40] <wingy> is it possible to just use some elements in jquery mobile for my jquery web app
[07:09:52] <wingy> i wanna use http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-beta.1/docs/forms/switch/
[07:10:09] <rhino__> Iszak: I also need to allow just .25 as well
[07:10:14] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: your <option>s text also has dots in it which you're not escaping
[07:10:36] <Iszak> rhino__, THIS is why you need to specify all possibilities
[07:10:38] <fRAiLtY-> I need to?
[07:10:45] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: and you're .addClass()ing on the <td> which works, but your css expects it on the <tr>
[07:10:57] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: yes you cant do  $('#idwith.dot')
[07:11:11] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: that would look for an id 'idwith' and  class 'dot'
[07:11:39] <rhino__> Isak: sry, forgot about having to allow just the .35 or just .5
[07:11:47] <rhino__> any ideas?
[07:12:00] <inquisite> hey peeps
[07:12:02] <Iszak> rhino__ /^(?:([1-9]\d{0,3}(?:\.(\.\d{1,2}))?|0?(\.\d{1,2})))$/
[07:16:18] <rhino__> Iszak:  that one fails on whole number(i.e. 111 or 2345)
[07:18:21] <Iszak> Sorry the question mark was in the wrong place /^(?:([1-9]\d{0,3}(?:\.(\.\d{1,2})?)|0?(\.\d{1,2})))$/
[07:19:26] <Iszak> inefficiencies, /^(?:[1-9]\d{0,3}(?:\.(\.\d{1,2})?|0?\.\d{1,2})$/
[07:19:46] <Iszak> rhino__ come back into #regex I'm polluting this channel and we'll fix you up
[07:21:33] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  If replace(/\s+/g, '') replaces spaces with nothing, how do I include . in that too ?
[07:22:39] <Iszak> fRAiLtY- replace(/[\s.]/g, '')
[07:24:58] <fRAiLtY-> Cheers, now as above, I've corrected the dots shoky. One caveat, I can't CHANGE the CSS that's there as that effects another table elsewhere, but can add to it http://jsfiddle.net/e9HL2/13/
[07:31:05] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: .parent().addClass('row-selected');
[07:32:33] <raj> hola shoks
[07:35:07] <ScottG> What am I overlooking here? Why does this return an empty string? $('<input>').html()
[07:35:27] <buddyq> hi guys, i was hoping someone could tell me how to slide the top header bar up to only show the navigation (hiding the title).

[07:35:39] <fRAiLtY-> Thank shoky
[07:35:42] <fRAiLtY-> Works a treat
[07:37:26] <xckpd7> is this the room to ask about handlebars? I'm questioning the usefulness of helpers
[07:37:43] <xckpd7> not that they aren't, but in the examples that I"m looking at, I don't see the point for the over complexity
[07:41:58] <fusion27> I'm trying to get this one to return this string, but my skull thickness appears to be getting in the way… I'm returning '', can anyone help a brother pry his head from his arse? http://pastie.org/4714225
[07:42:14] <derekpioneer> xckpd7: might have something to do with examples always being bad
[07:42:24] <derekpioneer> like when you look at the examples for backbone.js you're like "this is the dumbest thing i've ever seen"
[07:42:34] <derekpioneer> but then when you're looking at a 15,000 line javascript program it's a little bit different
[07:43:27] <fusion27> I know that #14 is returning a value
[07:43:34] <fusion27> Help me be less stupid
[07:45:15] <Adrien_> Can some one help me with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12398198/jquery-sortable please?

[07:48:40] <pangelovski> hi guys
[07:49:21] <pangelovski> i have a link that consists of <a>Text </a>, now I'm wondering if it is possible to append something after the some value inside the link
[07:52:55] <christo_m> Hello, I'm using FullCalendar for an app I'm creating, and I have the editable option set to true, however the appointment events I have over top of my availabilities are not resizable, but the availabilities are

[08:01:02] <barraponto> parsing querystrings with js/jquery?
[08:01:09] <barraponto> I found http://stackoverflow.com/a/3855394/207119 but it's a snippet.
[08:01:15] <barraponto> is there any mantained plugin?
[08:05:08] <esiegel> I have a function that works perfectly when pasted into the console, but does select any elements when it's in my .html or .js files. I'll have a link to a jsfiddle in one second, I was just wondering if there was some general solution. Thanks!
[08:05:57] <pachet> esiegel: usually that's because you're calling the function before the dom has been fully parsed
[08:06:20] <esiegel> So just put it into a $(document).ready()?
[08:07:41] <pachet> or just put that script before </body>
[08:08:05] <pachet> either way you're taking steps to make sure it's not being run until the elements you're trying to reference have actually been enumerated on the DOM
[08:09:05] <esiegel> Gotcha. I think the problem is that I'm selecting an element that comes into the DOM through an .ajax(); call and the function is getting called before THAT.
[08:09:19] <esiegel> Thanks, patcher!
[08:09:26] <esiegel> pachet*
[08:09:35] <pachet> yw :]
[08:23:08] <rgr> morning. What do you recommend regarding logging exceptions - what do I need to google to read about pertinent runtime info such as current functionname, exception type etc in order to log() some sane development info in the console.
[08:28:51] <ScottG> So I have an element and I attach a click listner on it. Then I add another element inside it and this doesn't seem to have the click listner. Is there any way to make listners propagate to children regardless of when they were added?
[08:29:52] <rgr> add a listener that invokes th eparent click?
[08:30:32] <ScottG> That's a good idea. How would I do that?
[08:31:07] <shahraship> hey guys, so jquery doesn't have a default json stringify method, or am I missing something? I see a parseJson and also a param method, but nothing that takes a json object and converts it into a json string. Any suggestions?
[08:32:10] <ajpiano> ?stringify @ shahraship
[08:32:11] <bot-t> shahraship, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[08:32:45] <BillCriswell> ScottG: That sounds wrong.
[08:32:59] <pachet> rgr: there is a 'stack' property on the thrown exception
[08:33:01] <ScottG> BillCriswell: What about what I'm doing sounds wrong?
[08:33:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/mvZvp/ I can't replicate your problem with this code...
[08:33:11] <pachet> rgr: not sure about IE, but should work in FF and chrome
[08:33:38] <shahraship> @bot-t Thanks. I'll use that json-js.
[08:33:49] <ScottG> BillCriswell: Let me take a loook
[08:33:51] <BillCriswell> ScottG: Unless I'm misunderstanding something.
[08:34:08] <BillCriswell> Which I've been known to do... often!
[08:34:15] <pachet> shahraship: bot-t is the channel bot, ajpiano was pulling the strings
[08:35:14] <shahraship> @pachet thanks.. for letting me know. :)
[08:35:46] <ScottG> BillCriswell: No that does seem like what I have going. The child is a checkbox but I change it and that doesn't seem to make a difference
[08:37:07] <BillCriswell> ScottG: http://jsfiddle.net/mvZvp/1/ still works ok here. Any events on that checkbox?
[08:39:30] <phelix> Could someone please go to: https://www.capedfcu.org/ and then click like the BBB icon in the upper right. It does like an overlay leaving the website message. Does anyone know how this is done or what its called?
[08:40:07] <firstclassfunc_> must my server return something in order for an ajax post to succeed? I don't need to return anything. When I return nothing, jquery reports the ajax call fails (but the server gets the post data). When I return a string, the ajax call succeeds
[08:40:33] <BillCriswell> ScottG: http://jsfiddle.net/mvZvp/2/ for example woudls top the parents event from firing off.
[08:42:05] <ScottG> Looking into a possible problem
[08:44:34] <sekyms> There a way to grab part of a file via ajax?
[08:46:31] <politron_> Hi there
[08:46:39] <pachet> hi
[08:46:43] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLy4j8EZIk for you
[08:46:58] <politron_> I'm using JQuery 1.7 and I want to mark as selected one entry of my select by the option value
[08:47:20] <politron_> I have try this both things without good result
[08:47:21] <politron_>         $('[name="selectedCountry"]').option.val(country).attr('selected',true);
[08:47:21] <politron_>         $("[name='selectedCountry'] option[text=" + country +"]").attr("selected",true) ;
[08:47:34] <sekyms> so weird when you are in two diferent channels on two different servers and the same person is in both of them
[08:47:38] <politron_> somebody can help me please, runout of ideas
[08:47:44] <pachet> $('#my_select').val(country)
[08:47:47] <pachet> politron_^
[08:47:57] <politron_> select do not have id and cannot have it
[08:47:59] <politron_> only name
[08:48:06] <someprimetime> politron_ what is .option?
[08:48:22] <politron_> sorry forget about .option in the first script
[08:48:57] <pachet> politron_ : certainly you mean that it can't have it in the context of your app?
[08:49:05] <pachet> either way, use whatever selector you need to
[08:49:45] <pachet> at least filter it by tag name :[ $('select [name="foo"]')
[08:50:05] <politron_> ok let me change that
[08:50:38] <ScottG> BillCriswell: Figured it out. I was being silly and using jq ui's selectable in a place I should have been using click
[08:50:53] <BillCriswell> ScottG: Good times!
[08:52:28] <politron_> nothing
[08:52:38] <politron_> still this both options does not works
[08:52:38] <politron_>         $('select [name="foo"]').val(country).attr('selected',true);
[08:52:39] <politron_>         $('select [name="foo"] option[text=" + country +"]').attr("selected",true) ;
[08:52:50] <politron_> ahhhh
[08:52:55] <politron_> sorry
[08:53:01] <politron_> did not change the name XDD!
[08:53:07] <pachet> lose the attr, you're not modifying the option
[08:54:52] <politron_> nope
[08:55:02] <politron_> it;s not working
[08:55:51] <politron_> ok but as I read i cannot set the selected by option value since version 1.3 so  $('select [name="foo"]').val(country) does not working
[08:55:53] <snover> goodbye friends
[08:58:27] <pachet> politron_: works for me: jsfiddle.net/FF3E2
[08:59:22] <pachet> politron_: oh, i misstyped that selector. no space between the tag name and the attribute filter, just noticed that
[08:59:31] <politron_> no it's not working
[08:59:42] <politron_> if you value is differents of you option value
[08:59:50] <pachet> ...
[08:59:55] <pachet> wat
[08:59:55] <b-ot> "object literal singleton" can't vs width other two.
[09:00:44] <politron_> is what I told you after version 1.3 it is not possible set the value by val if already exist value in the select
[09:02:24] <Eviltwin> If that starts serving a useful purpose, feel free to -q it
[09:03:15] <pachet> :[
[09:03:22] <pachet> politron_: still not sure what that means
[09:03:45] <pachet> or even what you're trying to do, if what i posted isn't harmonizing with you
[09:03:49] <ScottG> Is there something in jq like .find() except to search parent elements?
[09:03:55] <politron_> do you already modify the values in the option
[09:04:18] <starsinmypockets> I'm hiding all fieldsets class = 'foo'
[09:04:21] <pachet> do i modify them? no? they're part of the markup
[09:04:31] <Eviltwin> starsinmypockets: .parents()? .closest()?
[09:04:33] <politron_> change it to a different values that you have in the <option></option> and you will see how that script does not work
[09:04:40] <Eviltwin> Oops
[09:04:43] <Eviltwin> ScottG: ^
[09:04:58] <politron_> Do you understand?
[09:05:07] <starsinmypockets> I'd like to show all fieldsets with input elements populated with values...
[09:05:27] <pachet> politron_ : no, i don't understand, why don't you post a fiddle clearly illustrating what you mean
[09:05:38] <politron_> sure
[09:05:39] <pachet> because this whole verbal communication thing is holding us back i think
[09:05:41] <ScottG> Eviltwin: Ah parents looks good. Thanks
[09:05:59] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying: 	if ($('.foo input').val()) { $(this).closest('.foo').show(); }	
[09:06:00] <politron_> http://jsfiddle.net/FF3E2/1/
[09:06:05] <starsinmypockets> But no worky
[09:06:19] <politron_> is your script with different values
[09:06:32] <ScottG> actually clostst is probably safer
[09:07:39] <pachet> politron_: what? this is the same as the original link
[09:08:15] <politron_> sorry did not update
[09:08:32] <politron_> here
[09:08:32] <politron_> http://jsfiddle.net/FF3E2/3/
[09:08:40] <ner0x> var bcc_list = $( '#bcc' ).val().replace( / /g/ '' ).split( ';' );   if the .val() = '', bcc_list.length = 1?
[09:08:44] <ner0x> Is this expected?
[09:10:59] <politron_> pachet, you see the difference?
[09:11:00] <pachet> politron_: oh, setting by the node contents
[09:11:17] <pachet> politron_: jsfiddle.net/ShJA6/
[09:11:45] <politron_> brilliant!
[09:11:48] <politron_> pachet,
[09:11:53] <politron_> thanks so much
[09:11:56] <pachet> you're welcome
[09:12:23] <politron_> This JQuery world is alittle crazzy man, in every version they change all functionality
[09:15:41] <Eviltwin> politron_: Yeah, I started learning with 1.6 and now nothing works
[09:17:07] <ner0x> Anyone see my split question above? Pretty basic.
[09:17:55] <Eviltwin> Nope
[09:18:13] <ner0x> var bcc_list = $( '#bcc' ).val().replace( / /g/ '' ).split( ';' );   if the .val() = '', bcc_list.length = 1?
[09:18:17] <phelix> https://www.capedfcu.org/ Could someone please visit that and click the BBB link in the upper right hand side of the page. It provides a nice css styled popup window telling that you are leaving their website. Does anyone know how to do this??

[09:19:13] <Eviltwin> ?eval "".split(";").length
[09:19:17] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 1
[09:19:21] <Eviltwin> What'd you expect?
[09:19:30] <ner0x> 0
[09:19:39] <Eviltwin> ?eval "Hello World".split(";").length
[09:19:40] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 1
[09:19:49] <Eviltwin> ?eval "Hello World".split(" ").length
[09:19:50] <bot-t> Eviltwin: 2
[09:19:54] <Eviltwin> Why would you expect 0?
[09:20:03] <ner0x> Ah, I get it now.
[09:20:15] <ner0x> That answered my question.
[09:20:26] <ner0x> ?eval "".split(";")
[09:20:27] <bot-t> ner0x: [""]
[09:20:37] <ner0x> ?eval "".split(";").toString();
[09:20:37] <bot-t> ner0x: ""
[09:20:40] <ner0x> Perfect.
[09:23:49] <phelix> Anyone able to help me by chance?
[09:26:12] <Gho5t> phelix: it's call a modal window
[09:26:16] <Gho5t> or modal popup
[09:26:26] <Gho5t> jquery ui has a widget for that
[09:27:34] <phelix> Do you know where on their site they are using this? I mean what .js file i need to include to get this to work on my site?
[09:28:06] <Gho5t> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[09:28:28] <pachet> phelix: bro, just write your own or use the one linked above
[09:28:30] <pachet> its super simple
[09:28:37] <phelix> I don't know any jquery at all
[09:28:47] <Zzaichik> you mean javaqueries
[09:28:52] <pachet> well, you've come to the right place to learn some
[09:28:54] <phelix> where on their site are they doing this? I could just copy what they are using?
[09:28:59] <Gho5t> jeez due
[09:29:02] <Gho5t> *dude
[09:29:04] <Gho5t> i just linked you
[09:29:05] <phelix> I know php/css just no jquery
[09:29:08] <Gho5t> why are you wasting my time
[09:29:13] <Zzaichik> actually I need to stop saying that - JavaQuery is a real thing now.
[09:29:22] <phelix> I Saw the link but how is this done or to tell if you are leaving the site so that it shows when leaving the site only?
[09:29:42] <Gho5t> get the popup working first
[09:29:51] <Gho5t> then come here and ask about the next step
[09:29:56] <phelix> ok
[09:35:20] <phelix> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.23/jquery-ui.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> Is this the right script I should be using?
[09:35:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> use the google one :p
[09:36:14] <ravenzz> don't use it at all :p
[09:36:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js"></script> - replace 1.8.1 with 1 and you'll always have the latest version, until jquery 2 comes out
[09:36:45] <ravenzz> or at least wait until the main new version
[09:37:10] <ravenzz> jquery ui and mobile are ugly
[09:37:16] <ravenzz> imho
[09:39:19] <adac> I have a loop where I do print out a lot of links. When I click on that link js should be called an the link should be "read" by javascript. how can I do this? Mean every link has its own css id
[09:39:50] <ner0x> Eviltwin: Thanks for the help. Seeing eval worked it out for me.
[09:39:56] <ner0x> Eviltwin++
[09:40:21] <phelix> Gho5t: Hmm, doesn't seem to be working. I must be missing something small. But I think that i have got everything in there.
[09:49:58] <arielserafini> j #javascript
[09:50:01] <arielserafini> er
[09:52:44] <phelix> Gho5t: You still around?
[09:59:18] <donkeycongo> Ive got this simple script: http://jsfiddle.net/8TtcR/ for some reason it wont delete the cookie in this case, and if I change "null" to "" or "[]", it instead refuses to change the value when .length>0. Any ideas?
[10:00:03] <ShadowChancellor> hey I'm trying to call a $ function through a string…and my syntax is off
[10:00:05] <ShadowChancellor> transition : function (elem,speed,type) {
[10:00:05] <ShadowChancellor>       return elem.$[type](speed)
[10:00:28] <ravenzz> wut
[10:00:42] <Gho5t> wat
[10:01:09] <ShadowChancellor> ideally it would return something like $('div').fadeIn(500)
[10:01:16] <ShadowChancellor> depending on the params
[10:01:38] <ShadowChancellor> basically I'm trying to determine the actual method that gets called through the type string
[10:04:08] <ravenzz> so probably something like $.fn[type].call(elem, speed);
[10:04:40] <ravenzz> but this would execute the type function immediately
[10:04:41] <ShadowChancellor> YES
[10:05:02] <ShadowChancellor> oh rather than returning it?
[10:05:16] <ravenzz> and you have to check if type exists
[10:05:48] <ravenzz> ShadowChancellor yes
[10:06:04] <ravenzz> why would you return a boh? string?
[10:06:32] <ShadowChancellor> good question
[10:06:39] <ravenzz> you could return a function
[10:06:47] <ravenzz> you can execute later
[10:06:50] <ravenzz> anyway
[10:06:55] <ShadowChancellor> just wrap it in function(){}?
[10:07:29] <ravenzz> return function () { $.fn[type].call(elem, speed); }
[10:07:48] <ShadowChancellor> awesome yeah that's exactly it
[10:07:53] <ShadowChancellor> sorry for the confusion
[10:08:06] <ravenzz> so you can do var foo = whatever.transition(elem, speed, type); and foo() later
[10:09:03] <ShadowChancellor> thanks
[10:09:06] <ravenzz> yw
[10:09:13] <pangelovski> hi guys I'm trying to implement a if statement and i have two values that can either be 0 or 1. what is the best way to check these values and do action
[10:09:16] <phelix> http://www.iconcreditunion.org/icon-membership Could someone please help me try and figure out this modal dialog box? im pretty new to js
[10:10:17] <Gho5t> pangelovski: are you asking how to write an if statement?
[10:10:38] <ravenzz> ShadowChancellor and remember to check if typeof $.fn[type] === 'function'
[10:10:48] <pangelovski> Gho5t: I'm trying to do boolean algebra
[10:11:33] <ShadowChancellor> will do
[10:12:06] <ravenzz> pangelovski that's an if or valueA && valueB && doSomething(valueA, valueB);
[10:12:09] <ravenzz> its shorthand
[10:18:49] <fdask> i'm having trouble getting the callback function to fire on a .load() in Firefox 15.  anyone else experience this?
[10:26:01] <buddyq> hi guys, i was hoping someone could tell me how to slide the top header bar up to only show the navigation (hiding the title).
[10:26:03] <buddyq> http://supersized.tangerinefiles.com/gallery/photo-gallery
[10:26:09] <multipass|2> how can i stop jquery mobile from doing its custom form stuff, like the custom select?
[10:27:00] <pangelovski> hi guys, can you please help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/m9jYZ/
[10:30:22] <pcht> eh pangelovski delete the ";" after the if(bottle != 0) line
[10:31:14] <pangelovski> wow, how the f didn't i notice it :)
[10:31:36] <pcht> to much programming man ;)
[10:33:00] <buddyq> can anyone please help me?
[10:33:40] <buddyq> on page load, I just need my header to slide up enough to ONLY show the navbar. Basically just hiding the title to make room for the slideshow on the gallery page. http://supersized.tangerinefiles.com/gallery/photo-gallery
[10:38:16] <davesnothereman> Having a problem with values with .'s http://jsfiddle.net/Td3k3/
[10:39:02] <Eviltwin> Step 1: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[10:41:34] <joehannes> good afternoon sirs! might someone be in good spirits to help me with a solution to a quite simple problem
[10:41:50] <joehannes> it irks me why this shouldn't work, but in fact it doesn't work
[10:42:19] <joehannes> I actually happen to know some kind of workaround, but I am fed up with it and want to know what's wrong
[10:43:27] <joehannes> well, ok, I happen to have the tiniest of Event-Centers .... and the registerListener method doesn't do it's job properly
[10:44:06] <ak> ?demo @ joehannes
[10:44:06] <joehannes> I hope as well, deems me actually, why, someone in here might speak coffee, but I can quickly run and get some cacao as well if necessary
[10:44:15] <joehannes> @options.listeners[ev] = @options.listeners[ev]?.add(listeners).clone() ? $(listeners.slice())
[10:44:46] <joehannes> this is the line ... all the cloning and slicing is my attempts at finding out why on earth this.options.listeners[ev] keeps being empty
[10:45:12] <joehannes> so in plain javascript that would be something like:
[10:45:20] <dogarrhea2> these cookie limitations for browsers like firefox (300 it says).  Is this for the entire browser? or is it for each site?
[10:46:54] <ak> davesnothereman: http://jsfiddle.net/Td3k3/6/
[10:47:21] <joehannes> this.options.listeners['onWidgetActivated'] = this.options.listeners['onWidgetActivated'].length ? this.options.listeners['oWA'].add(newListenerEls).clone() : $(newListeners.slice())
[10:47:59] <joehannes> I just don't happen to understand why this.options.listeners keeps being Array (length=0)
[10:48:09] <joehannes> --- empty
[10:48:17] <ak> joehannes: try to make a simple version of this on jsfiddle, maybe someone can help you...
[10:48:46] <joehannes> hmmm, you're right, sure
[10:49:03] <joehannes> might take a quick break fiddling with a guitar first
[10:49:45] <davesnothereman> Thanks ak, that seems to do the trick.
[10:55:34] <buddyq> can I slide something up only as many pixels as I want?
[10:55:45] <buddyq> Or as many pixels left to go?
[10:57:17] <joehannes> buddyq: what about animate?
[10:57:26] <buddyq> ah is that how I do it?
[10:58:52] <ak> buddyq: yes
[10:59:10] <buddyq> aha... okay... hmm.... so now I need to know how to od it.
[10:59:11] <buddyq> do
[11:00:00] <buddyq> so basically I need to animate my header to ONLY show the navigation bar at the top.
[11:00:02] <buddyq> http://supersized.tangerinefiles.com/gallery/photo-gallery
[11:00:16] <hackeron> hey, I have a bunch of img elements that look like this: "<img data-src="/recordings/504a68eb9438a0709e00018b/download?type=thumb">" -- how would I set the image src to the data-src value? -- $("img[data-src]").attr("src", some magic here?)?
[11:00:24] <ak> $(thing).animate({height: '200px'}, fast)
[11:00:33] <ak> something like this
[11:01:26] <Eviltwin> hackeron: $("img[data-src]").attr("src", function() { return $(this).attr("data-src"); }) ?
[11:01:33] <Danwe_WMDE> Anyone got an idea why when calling $( obj ).trigger( 'event', arg1, arg2 ... ), jQuery will call obj.event() without the supplied arguments? Is there a good reason not to provide them for the native handler?
[11:01:53] <ak> hackeron: $('img[data-src]').each(function(i){ $this.attr('src', $this.attr('data-src'))});
[11:01:59] <ak> ah
[11:02:02] <ak> i'm slow
[11:02:02] <ak> :D
[11:03:51] <dogarrhea2> in general, can race conditions happen in Java?
[11:03:57] <dogarrhea2> javascript that is
[11:04:15] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/pJnY5/
[11:04:18] <dogarrhea2> like two pieces of javascript code are executing at about the same time and the results of a cookie are indeterminant
[11:04:27] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: http://jsfiddle.net/pJnY5/
[11:04:42] <hackeron> Eviltwin: ak: ah, beautiful :D - it worked: $("img[data-src]").attr "src", -> $(this).attr("data-src")
[11:04:43] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: JavaScript is single-threaded
[11:05:05] <Eviltwin> Which means only one function is being executed at any given time
[11:05:07] <Wes-> Is there a way to determine if the datepicker module loaded correctly?  Should evaluating $.datepicker be enough?
[11:05:18] <Eviltwin> But that doesn't mean there can't be race conditions in other forms
[11:05:37] <devslash> i have 6 radio buttons named item0, item1 etc. is it possibly to have an event thats triggered when any of the radio buttons are clicked
[11:05:44] <dogarrhea2> so there is absolutely no way a cookie can have an indeterminant (logically speaking, who knows about heisenbugs)
[11:07:02] <termite> devslash: $("#id").find("input[type=radio]").click(callback)
[11:07:06] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: http://jsfiddle.net/TgRUR/
[11:07:15] <devslash> ahh thanks
[11:07:18] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: not what I meant, one sec.
[11:07:19] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: You can't predict what cookie will be set tothere
[11:07:49] <dogarrhea2> hmm i always get bar heh
[11:07:53] <dogarrhea2> but yea i see waht you're saying
[11:08:05] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Try refreshing a few more times
[11:08:33] <devslash> and how do i get the id of the item that was clicked
[11:08:58] <termite> callback will get the event parameter
[11:09:05] <termite> e.currentTarget
[11:09:29] <termite> e.currentTarget.id
[11:09:41] <devslash> ok thanks
[11:09:55] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/NzmMv/
[11:10:05] <Eviltwin> termite: Uh... this.id?
[11:10:31] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: Don't do things that way
[11:10:41] <devslash> termite do i have to add an argument for the function() ?
[11:10:53] <termite> yeah e
[11:11:34] <Danwe_WMDE> Do not what? Having anative handler?
[11:12:33] <devslash> termite so it'd be $("#id").find("input[type=radio]").click(callback,e) ?
[11:13:10] <termite> $("#id").find("input[type=radio]").click(function(e){});
[11:13:14] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: I think jQuery should simply pass through the arguments.
[11:15:35] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: What you're doing is a hack. The thing that triggers that function was designed for triggering things like .blur() and .focus() on DOM elements
[11:16:04] <devslash> hmm
[11:16:32] <Eviltwin> It is not supposed to be used the way you're trying to use it
[11:16:42] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: I don't think so, it might be a feature for being able to mimic the event system used for native DOM stuff.
[11:16:54] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: Then you think wrong
[11:17:02] <Danwe_WMDE> why?
[11:17:12] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: Because I've read the source
[11:17:17] <Eviltwin> And the explanation why it's there
[11:17:20] <termite> what is he doing wrong
[11:17:21] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: and so did I
[11:17:42] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: If I am wrong, the go damn native handler shouldn't be called (only for native DOM events)
[11:18:21] <devslash> iits not working
[11:18:31] <termite> hold on
[11:18:37] <superlukas> hey guys i get a 'object 17 has no method …' error and i'd like to find out which object that is
[11:18:40] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: The call isn't there to trigger a handler, it's there to trigger an effect
[11:18:50] <Eviltwin> Like bluring or focusing an element
[11:18:54] <devslash> termite: in the event i alert the value of e.currentTarget.id but it's not displaying nything
[11:19:10] <termite> I am doing a fiddle give me a sec
[11:19:27] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: You see how it doesn't run if event.isDefaultPrevented() is true?
[11:19:44] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: So I am not supposed to have such "effects" in my prototypes? think of some simple "enable"/"disable" functions/events
[11:20:13] <devslash> me too
[11:20:22] <Eviltwin> Why are you doing $(object) instead of $(element) anyway?
[11:20:44] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: Right, and it shouldn't run if event.isDefaultPrevented() is called because IT IS THE DEFAULT, it is the native handler of my custom object
[11:21:26] <Eviltwin> Stop propagation is for stopping handlers
[11:21:34] <Eviltwin> Prevent default is for stopping the browser action
[11:22:33] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: What should stop me making use of stopdefault for my custom objects? It's a nice to have in libs if you don't fear the extra amount of work. jQuery ui stuff implements it sometimes afaik
[11:22:44] <devslash> termite: ok i got it now
[11:23:09] <devslash> termite  http://jsfiddle.net/L3hZz/
[11:23:18] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: You are abusing the way the event system works
[11:23:57] <Eviltwin> Danwe_WMDE: If you still believe this is a bug you can consider bringing it up in #jquery-dev but I would be shocked if they say anything different from what I already have
[11:24:01] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: no, I am USING it, not ignoring half of its features ;)
[11:24:02] <termite> good
[11:24:22] <devslash> jsfiddle is really cool
[11:24:28] <devslash> I've only just discovered it recently
[11:25:01] <Danwe_WMDE> Eviltwin: thanks anyhow, I'll try dev
[11:27:00] <devslash> termite: i dunno why but I'm getting an illegal token error now. this is my code: $('input[type=radio]').live('change', function(e) { });
[11:27:09] <devslash> if i comment it out, the error goes away
[11:27:41] <devslash> the exact error is "uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:28:18] <b-lew> anyone have an iPad? I'm having a backstretch js problem and I was wondering if I could grab some help
[11:29:37] <buddyq> why is the header bouncing when I go back to hover on it? It slides twice and finally stops?
[11:29:51] <termite> devslash: you have an extra character in your code
[11:29:58] <devslash> where ?
[11:30:12] <termite> do you use lint?
[11:30:16] <devslash> no
[11:30:27] <buddyq> http://supersized.tangerinefiles.com/
[11:30:29] <buddyq> sorry
[11:30:31] <termite> what editor do you use
[11:30:42] <devslash> textwrangler
[11:30:47] <devslash> i think I fixed it
[11:31:41] <termite> dump your code in here and see what it says
[11:31:42] <termite> http://www.jslint.com/
[11:31:48] <devslash> its fixed
[11:31:49] <termite> you should always lint your code
[11:31:56] <devslash> i don't know what was wrong

[11:32:45] <xckpd7> whoops: http://jsfiddle.net/zEUCZ/2/
[11:33:07] <le_gars> I have jsfidle if any one could help?
[11:33:51] <buddyq> hey guys, I used animate to slide my header up but when going to use hover, it's triggering where it USED to be.
[11:33:59] <buddyq> but firebug shows that it is not there.
[11:34:26] <termite> le_gars: just dump the string into a element using element.html(string)
[11:34:47] <termite> then use query to get the values
[11:35:17] <devslash> termite: why is lint important ?
[11:35:18] <termite> where is you fiddle
[11:36:14] <buddyq> termite: who you talking to?
[11:36:24] <termite> devslash: that is liking why air is important.  It helps you find issues in your code that might not show up in certain browsers
[11:36:34] <devslash> ok
[11:36:58] <termite> le_gars:do you have a lint
[11:37:18] <termite> fiddle rather
[11:37:34] <le_gars> termite: yes I do here it is thanks http://jsfiddle.net/nWDDV/3/
[11:38:19] <le_gars> basically in result I have it all, then I thought it would be easy to just do a .find("pre")
[11:38:47] <le_gars> but that just gives me back two empty brackets
[11:38:50] <Eviltwin> le_gars: Do you have an actual conf?
[11:38:57] <Eviltwin> That you can link us to
[11:40:31] <termite>  le_gars: check it out
[11:40:31] <buddyq> I want to reverse these two actions but not sure how to do it since I have my own function? jQuery('.header h2').fadeIn(700,function(){
[11:40:32] <buddyq> 					slideHeader(height);
[11:40:42] <arielserafini> le_gars, did you try using .load() like I suggested yesterday?
[11:42:06] <le_gars> Ahh arielserafini hey thanks for the help yesterday. I tried it but then I got a problem with cross domain same origin problem. As I'm doing the request from my local machine.
[11:42:31] <arielserafini> but in production it's on the same domain, right?
[11:43:29] <le_gars> I included the jquery.xdomainajax.js which helps me. But thats when I use $.gey
[11:43:43] <le_gars> $.get lol freudian slip
[11:43:48] <arielserafini> haha
[11:44:24] <le_gars> well no, actually this is not for production purposes it's a spare time thing
[11:44:45] <arielserafini> le_gars, you can run chrome with --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security
[11:45:00] <arielserafini> le_gars, and it will work with cross domain requests
[11:45:23] <arielserafini> i recommend you do it on chrome canary (not your main browser)
[11:46:06] <le_gars> hm yes I read something about that. Ill try that then aybe it will work with your suggested .load
[11:47:56] <le_gars> and now it is time for me to be ashamed…I dont have chrome canary…but will install it now.
[11:48:18] <devslash> termite: why does that site nitpick over small details like a missing space after a comma in a function call ? i thought whitespace doesn't matter in that context
[11:48:58] <Eviltwin> devslash: It does a lot of style bitching as well
[11:49:02] <Eviltwin> I think you can turn it off though
[11:49:11] <devslash> ok
[11:50:01] <termite> yeah you can tell it to turn off stuff
[11:50:28] <termite> ideally you can install node.js and install jslint using npm and just do it locally
[11:50:38] <aberrant> hi all
[11:50:43] <aberrant> I'm having a rookie problem here.
[11:50:53] <aberrant> I have a $(document).ready(function() { ...
[11:51:07] <aberrant> but according to my console we're not making it past that line
[11:51:15] <aberrant> it's just hanging.
[11:52:14] <aberrant> any suggestions on how to troubleshoot?
[11:53:01] <termite> put an alert inside you function and see if it runs
[11:53:16] <le_gars> or console.log()
[11:53:30] <termite> alert is more dramatic
[11:53:32] <le_gars> but maybe alert is more efficient actually
[11:53:35] <le_gars> ;)
[11:55:32] <termite> aberrant: you did include query right
[11:55:45] <aberrant> the jquery source? yeah.
[11:55:47] <termite> aberrant:jquery that is
[11:55:59] <aberrant> but this might be more complicated, since I'm trying to use jit.js
[11:56:12] <aberrant> so I think I'll try the body onload= that he does instead

[12:03:21] <hampsterblade> Hi.  I'm trying to recieve an xml file and parse it from an api.  The API sends it gzip compressed and I have no control over it so I can't do anything to it with PHP.  What would the best AJAX method to receive this data.  I'm running out of ideas
[12:03:21] <aberrant> termite: the IP is stuck at "var fd=" (the first line of init())
[12:03:27] <vacho> I have a tough question..
[12:03:44] <Eviltwin> Oh no
[12:03:55] <vacho> using an ajax call, how can I get it to return a downloadable excel file created by a php script? :)
[12:03:59] <vacho> ajpiano: that's for you :)
[12:04:14] <Eviltwin> So you want it to actually download in the browser?
[12:04:40] <Gho5t> Mo9a7i: something like $.getJSON('someUrl', function(result) { confirm(result.id)); });
[12:04:41] <NoiseEee> vacho: by sending back a reference to the file on the server, and opening a new window that will d/l that file
[12:04:54] <Gho5t> Mo9a7i: it's asynchronous so you have to use the callback.
[12:05:04] <Eviltwin> vacho: Or an <iframe> works, I think
[12:05:20] <vacho> how do I make it open a new window?
[12:05:28] <Gho5t> $.getJSON itself just returns a jqXHR object which is not going to contain your result
[12:05:31] <Eviltwin> window.open?
[12:05:41] <Eviltwin> <a target="blank" ...>
[12:06:09] <termite> aberrant:hmm guess it's not initializing correctly.  I would do $jit.ForceDirected.prototype = {} definition
[12:06:14] <vacho> well, it's an ajax form submit that goes to a file called search.ajax.php that in turn generates an excel file....I just want it to pop up as a download.
[12:06:28] <Eviltwin> Solution
[12:06:35] <aberrant> termite: ok, one sec.
[12:06:37] <Eviltwin> <form target="blank" method="post">
[12:06:41] <Eviltwin> Let it submit normally
[12:06:44] <Eviltwin> No AJAX
[12:07:01] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/jyrts0rb
[12:07:12] <Eviltwin> target="_blank"
[12:07:19] <phelix> Gho5t: http://www.iconcreditunion.org/icon-membership I have this modal working now. I think that i just need a little tiny help figuring out how to get it to actually open this .html file so that I can add content to this popup. If you visit that url in the upper left hand corner there is a link that says Howdy if you click that it displays.
[12:07:48] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[12:07:53] <Eviltwin> I didn't realize Excel tables used HTML
[12:08:24] <vacho> that's my function that will return the excel
[12:08:36] <hampsterblade> OK, the API I'm trying to pull from has files like this http://api.anidb.net:9001/httpapi?request=anime&client=jconlibrary&clientver=1&protover=1&aid=6048 for unknown reasons PHP takes a good 30 seconds-2 minutes to decompress this file.  Locally it takes about 50ms.  I would really prefer to do it locally for this reasoning.  Does anyone know how this can be done
[12:08:56] <vacho> NoiseEee: care to take a look when u have time?
[12:09:47] <aberrant> termite:what does .prototype do?
[12:09:54] <Mo9a7i> Gho5t: can't i just use the result that I'm getting from my post ? which i am alreay inside ? do i have to make another call ??
[12:09:55] <Gho5t> phelix: all you have to do is put your html within the div that you are turning into a dialog. e.g. <div id="dialog"><div>foo</div></div>
[12:10:16] <phelix> Gho5t: this script isn't doing it this way
[12:10:29] <Gho5t> Mo9a7i: yes
[12:10:29] <phelix> the script is creating it
[12:10:48] <NoiseEee> vacho: if you want to prompt a user download, you need to send a new document.  instead of streaming that document back, save it on the server somewhere, and pass the location back to JS to download it
[12:10:54] <Gho5t> Mo9a7i: get rid of the .getJSON and just use the result object e.g. result.id
[12:11:03] <vacho> NoiseEee: ok, help me get started?
[12:11:06] <vacho> :)
[12:11:23] <NoiseEee> vacho:  just SAVE the document you are making intead of streaming it back.  fairly basic logic.  try ##php
[12:11:24] <termite> aberrant:it sorta how you define a class in js
[12:11:39] <vacho> NoiseEee: save it on the file system?
[12:11:44] <vacho> NoiseEee: and then? :)
[12:11:54] <termite> abberrant: http://jsfiddle.net/6UJtk/
[12:12:29] <NoiseEee> vacho: send back JSON like {"newFileLocation":"/path/to/file.xls"}  and then window.open or iframe to the newFileLocation
[12:12:35] <termite> abberant: look it up its more complex then that but if you are doing classes you want to know what prototype is
[12:13:00] <Gho5t> phelix: if you're not using jquery ui to create your modal then you're on your own. I don't have time to debug how this one works
[12:13:01] <vacho> I see, ok thanks!
[12:13:15] <vacho> NoiseEee: will pop up blockers come in the way?
[12:13:17] <phelix> ohh, hmm ok
[12:13:20] <Gho5t> phelix: it looks like there is a <div id="content"> try putting it in there.
[12:13:26] <Gho5t> also you have two <html> opening tags
[12:13:32] <Gho5t> and about a million included stylesheets
[12:13:34] <Gho5t> gross
[12:13:42] <phelix> I have tried that. But adding stuff there doesn't seem to add it to the window. Not sure whats going on.
[12:14:04] <Mo9a7i> Gho5t: it gives me "undefined"
[12:14:07] <termite> abberrant: http://jsfiddle.net/6UJtk/ this shows you how to do it old school
[12:14:21] <Mo9a7i> the result contains id.
[12:14:42] <NoiseEee> vacho: thats why you might want to use an iframe as Eviltwin suggested
[12:14:46] <phelix> I couldn't get the example on that jquery site you sent me to work properly. I would much rather use that one.
[12:15:00] <phelix> But I couldn't get it to display properly. Guess I am not familiar enough with jquery to get that working properly.
[12:15:12] <phelix> I would rather use that one as it was much much nicer.
[12:15:49] <Gho5t> right
[12:16:01] <Gho5t> might as well use some script kiddy one then the one most peole use
[12:16:40] <phelix> Well, I want to use that other one, any way you would help me implement it? jquery is completly foreign to me.
[12:17:49] <Gho5t> the source code for the example is right on the page i linked you to
[12:17:50] <mac_nibblet> Someone care to explain why a $([123, 123123, 123,]).each is throwing a error
[12:18:00] <mac_nibblet> oh without the ,
[12:18:06] <phelix> ok let me try to implement it again. I'll show you where I got stuck
[12:18:16] <TelFiRE> I have some jquery that runs on document load that is just a simple matter of animating the left and right values of relatively positioned elements. Seems to work everywhere but IE7 (and possibly 6 but I could care less on that one)... is there a trick to animating stuff in 7?
[12:18:16] <Eviltwin> mac_nibblet: For non-jQuery objects, use $.each instead
[12:18:17] <Gho5t> you include jquery and jquery-ui script references , jquery ui stylesheet, and then call $('#dialog').dialog()
[12:18:24] <Gho5t> not that hard
[12:18:28] <Eviltwin> mac_nibblet: $.each([123, 123123, 12], function() { ... })
[12:19:38] <termite> TelFiRE: how are you animating it
[12:20:30] <TelFiRE> This doesn't actually work in jsfiddle but here's the code http://jsfiddle.net/GVbz9/1/
[12:20:41] <TelFiRE> just using animate
[12:21:14] <aberrant> termine: thanks for the help. I'm gonna noodle on it a bit more.
[12:21:59] <phelix> Gho5t: Where and how do you call #dialog ? What if I want to put this inside a link?
[12:22:48] <le_gars> arielserafini: but disabling the same origin policy is it possible to switch it on again?
[12:23:02] <Gho5t> phelix:  $( ".selector" ).dialog( "option", "show" );
[12:23:09] <arielserafini> le_gars, you add that to the Chrome shortcut
[12:23:18] <arielserafini> are you on windows?
[12:23:22] <Gho5t> e.g. $('a#dialog-opener').click(function(){  $( ".selector" ).dialog( "option", "show" ); });
[12:23:32] <phelix> ok let me try that
[12:23:42] <termite> aberrant: I would do a console log before and after create that object and see if it's failing to create it
[12:23:57] <aberrant> will do - thanks again
[12:24:53] <phelix> Gho5t: I have tried adding that but doesn't seem to work properly. I made sure that the a#ID was set properly in the id tag on my link
[12:24:55] <le_gars> nevermind found it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/chrome-disable-same-origin-policy
[12:25:14] <le_gars> no at the moment I'm on a mac.
[12:25:28] <le_gars> At work windows, at home Mac :9
[12:25:28] <termite> TelFiRE: looks fine and it does work in jsfiddle
[12:25:35] <le_gars> :)
[12:25:42] <arielserafini> le_gars, same here, sadly :/
[12:25:51] <Gho5t> phelix: for all I know, you're not eveing including the jquery-ui script file
[12:25:58] <le_gars> :(
[12:26:01] <phelix> I am
[12:26:05] <Gho5t> and make sure you create the dialog first
[12:26:10] <Gho5t> and you do all this in document.ready
[12:26:13] <phelix> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[12:26:19] <arielserafini> le_gars, so yeah, basically you launch Chrome with that flag
[12:26:25] <phelix> and then from that link you sent me I copied the cody that needs to be inside <script>
[12:26:33] <arielserafini> le_gars, and if you close it, it will behave normally when you open it again
[12:27:03] <termite> TelFiRE: http://jsfiddle.net/GVbz9/2/ you had the position set to relative try absolute
[12:27:04] <phelix> you can see it with a view source.
[12:27:46] <phelix> I have also added. <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.23/themes/base/jquery-ui.css" type="text/css" media="all" />
[12:27:47] <TelFiRE> termite: well yes I have it relative because I want it to be part of the document flow although I guess I could just add padding if that's really necessary
[12:27:49] <NaN> is there a way to animate a toggleClass or an addClass?
[12:28:19] <phelix> and the html is located at the bottom of the page before the closing of the </body> tag
[12:28:34] <termite> TelFiRE: just wrap it in a div and set the divs position to relative
[12:29:02] <termite> TelFiRE: the absolute will use the contain as it's point of reference
[12:29:25] <Gho5t> phelix: use jsfiddle.net and paste your js code
[12:29:41] <TelFiRE> I updated it to absolute. Still not working in IE. Now it doesn't even start in the right place
[12:30:10] <dogarrhea2> what does it mean when you have a cookie that says "expired 2 days and a few hours ago" and there is still stuff in it?
[12:31:12] <ryanneufeld> dogarrhea2: my assumption would be that it's not accessible, and that it's just left behind on the filesystem
[12:31:19] <termite> TelFiRE: hold on spinning up IE 7.  I feel so dirty
[12:31:19] <phelix> Gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/s4cXP/
[12:33:51] <TelFiRE> termite: I know xD thanks for your help. if it's of any assistance I could pm you the url of the actual piece
[12:34:12] <termite> sure
[12:34:25] <termite> that would make it allot easier
[12:36:22] <TelFiRE> Also, I know this is superfluous, silly, and unnecessary, and if it were up to me I would not be doing it... alas, it is not up to me xD
[12:37:36] <devslash> termite: still here  ?
[12:37:55] <termite> devslash:yeah
[12:38:37] <Gho5t> phelix: http://jsfiddle.net/s4cXP/1/
[12:38:42] <Gho5t> now i gotta wash my hands of ya
[12:39:02] <phelix> awesome thank you!
[12:39:21] <phelix> Funny part is.. none of that script you have is part of their source..
[12:39:37] <devslash> I'm scrubbing my JS code. some of the warnings arent clear like "Combine this with the previous 'var' statement."  which appears multiple times
[12:39:39] <Gho5t> it's just using different options
[12:39:44] <Gho5t> read the docs
[12:40:02] <devslash> are you talking to me ?
[12:40:49] <termite> devslash:you asked if I was still here
[12:41:08] <devslash> i was replying to Gho5t
[12:41:22] <Gho5t> i wasn't talking to you
[12:41:33] <Gho5t> what a mess
[12:41:34] <zatan_> hey I have got "('.dropdown a').click(function(){   " how can I say that go to href link ?
[12:41:37] <devslash> anyways not sure if you can help but I'm getting a few warnings that appear many times that aren't clear to me
[12:42:17] <Eviltwin> devslash: JavaScript does variable hoisting
[12:42:17] <NoiseEee> devslash: its saying "instead of : 'var a = 12; var b = 24;' try  'var a=12, b=24'
[12:42:24] <Eviltwin> devslash: http://pastebin.com/qFgMf3KL
[12:42:37] <Eviltwin> That transformation will happen when it compiles
[12:42:38] <devslash> ugh
[12:42:42] <devslash> i don't like that
[12:42:46] <Eviltwin> But it's faster if it doesn't have to do it at all
[12:42:50] <Eviltwin> So turn off the flag
[12:43:00] <NoiseEee> devslash: but you can leave all that to a good processor like uglifyjs for example, which will rewrite your code to do that
[12:43:25] <devslash> which option do i turn off
[12:43:27] <NoiseEee> keep your code readable/sensible, deliver a version that has been concat'd/minified/uglified/etc
[12:43:28] <haizum> how come my i can't get a simple counter to work? i did var mycounter = 1; mycounter++; inside of a function which is being called over and over, and its not incrementing
[12:43:35] <haizum> omg
[12:43:38] <haizum> i just answered my own question
[12:43:40] <haizum> lol
[12:43:46] <haizum> the function is resetting it back to 1 every time
[12:43:59] <Eviltwin> devslash, NoiseEee: There are reasons not to code that way though: http://benalman.com/news/2012/05/multiple-var-statements-javascript/
[12:44:06] <Eviltwin> But the code you shit should be that way
[12:44:08] <Eviltwin> ship*
[12:44:14] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: indeed i'm actually saying that, or i meant to
[12:44:25] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: write it long, ship it short :)
[12:44:35] <Eviltwin> I suppose it looks like shit after uglify it
[12:46:22] <phelix> Any way someone could help me figure out why this script isn't working on my page? I have copied it exactly from here but when I click this link it doesn't do anything. http://jsfiddle.net/s4cXP/1/
[12:47:08] <Eviltwin> Did you load the attached resources?
[12:47:59] <devslash> wtf ?  for (i=0;i < item.length;i++) { is getting the warning Unexpected ++
[12:48:28] <phelix> Eviltwin: me?
[12:49:45] <Eviltwin> devslash: It might be shitpicking about it not being i += 1
[12:50:02] <devslash> i have other for loops that its not complaining bout… :p
[12:50:06] <Eviltwin> devslash: Did you look at the options at the bottom here: http://www.jslint.com
[12:50:14] <devslash> yes
[12:50:20] <Eviltwin> It has a tendency to complain about one thing at a time
[12:53:42] <devslash> Eviltwin: its also complaining about the 2nd line in this code: http://jsfiddle.net/bmq2v/ its saying "unexpected else after return"
[12:54:13] <NoiseEee> tbh devslash, a fair number of people find jslint to be annoying as all getout
[12:54:23] <devslash> I'm one of them
[12:54:32] <NoiseEee> devslash: you might want to try jshint or a nice IDE that can integrate jshint and highlights issues as you code
[12:54:39] <Eviltwin> devslash: It's probably looking for this: http://jsfiddle.net/bmq2v/1/
[12:54:56] <Eviltwin> Which produces identical results
[12:55:03] <devslash> yea
[12:55:07] <TelFiRE> I have a big block of html I want to append, do I have to escape the < and > or something? Because it complains at the 2nd tag's opening <
[12:55:07] <devslash> but eliminates else
[12:55:40] <Eviltwin> It produces identical results
[12:55:50] <phelix> If someone could please help me troubleshoot why this modal isn't working on my page that would help me out so much. I think that i am really close.. http://www.iconcreditunion.org/ is the site. I been working at this for like 4 hours now .. =/
[12:56:45] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: $(el).html('<p>big string of html with no escaping</p>');
[12:57:06] <TelFiRE> NoiseEee: are line breaks ok?
[12:57:25] <TelFiRE> That's what I have, but as I mentioned, the second tag's opening < throws an error
[12:57:27] <arielserafini> phelix, you don't seem to have jquery UI loaded on the page
[12:57:33] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: tias?
[12:57:42] <Eviltwin> devslash: http://pastebin.com/GTqKxASe
[12:57:51] <TelFiRE> ... I already did. It isn't working and I'm trying to figure out why
[12:57:55] <phelix>  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js"></script> this isn't it?
[12:58:07] <arielserafini> phelix, nope, that's jQuery
[12:58:12] <devslash> yes but when you are returning it doesn't change the logic
[12:58:14] <arielserafini> jQuery UI is a separate file/project
[12:58:16] <arielserafini> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.23/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[12:58:47] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: if you're asking about <br />, thats fine... but line breaks in JS strings are never ok
[12:58:59] <phelix> hah, that was it!! awesome than kyou!
[12:59:02] <Eviltwin> ?
[12:59:18] <TelFiRE> ok. Even in quotes. so the html is just going to be jumbled and stupid and there's no way around that?
[12:59:29] <TelFiRE> well I guess echoing lines individually but eff that lol
[13:00:09] <NoiseEee> TelFiRE: remove the linebreaks?
[13:00:49] <TelFiRE> thereby making it jumbled and stupid :P thats ok though doesn't really matter
[13:00:59] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/4d6GnAXv ?
[13:01:35] <dogarrhea2> is it also possible to change cookie expiration dates from the server side?
[13:01:39] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: pretty sure he was asking more about http://pastebin.com/7Tf6jpcW
[13:01:41] <dogarrhea2> cookies that are stored on the browser
[13:02:02] <Eviltwin> devslash: Yes
[13:02:11] <Eviltwin> But it needs to happen as an HTTP response
[13:02:24] <arielserafini> phelix, glad it worked :)
[13:03:20] <coder7of9> using jq1.5  i have a text field with class=numeric  which ensures only numeric values are entered. i wish to also add an onchange event however if this class is present the onchange event does not fire:  $('#id').change(function() { ... );   how to get these both or must i remove the numeric class and handle it in my custom change method?
[13:03:27] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Implementation
[13:04:00] <wolfehr> hi guys, how comes $(elem).find('#myItem').length returns 0, when a dump of $(elem).find('#myItem') shows there is something there?
[13:04:53] <NoiseEee> wolfehr: i dunno what 'dump' is, but you should really just $('#myItem')
[13:05:04] <wolfehr> console.log()
[13:05:17] <wolfehr> I can't, it's in a ajax response
[13:05:35] <wolfehr> $(ajaxData).find('#myItem');
[13:07:18] <NoiseEee> try .filter, or paste an example on jsfiddle
[13:08:50] <catery> have any of you guys used NPAPI
[13:10:24] <void> does anyone know, may the following to be considered safe: $(selector).html('<div>
[13:10:36] <void> oops. sent a bit early
[13:11:45] <void> $(selector).html('<div>aaa</div>'); assert( $(selector+' div').length, 1)
[13:12:27] <void> I mean, html manipulation speed is not infinite
[13:12:48] <void> can I rely in the next javascript code that DOM was altered successfully?
[13:12:59] <void> If not, how can I wait until it does?
[13:14:32] <Eviltwin> void: It's a synchronous action
[13:14:44] <Eviltwin> void: The assertion will not be executed until the DOM has been updated
[13:14:59] <phelix> http://www.iconcreditunion.org/home# Ok, I have this site setup now so that I can attach an id to a link and it will create a css overlay on the page. But my purpose is to have this popup on links that take you away from the page. Is there a way to tell this not to just directly take you to the page and decide on a leave or stay button on the overlay popup? That make any sense?
[13:15:43] <Eviltwin> However I'd recommend doing var $elem = $(selector).first(); assert($elem.length, 1); $elem.html("<div>aaa</div>"); assert($elem.find("div").length, 1);
[13:18:25] <void> Eviltwin: thank you. I'm fighting with some weird problem which occurs in some rare cases.
[13:18:43] <void> Eviltwin: and yes, I was using .find() in real code..
[13:19:42] <phelix> Anyone know if that is something that can be done using jquery?
[13:20:49] <WhoopYeah> What are peoples favourite lightbox plugins at the moment? Paid or free
[13:22:29] <Slayed> phelix: Why not just set a click handler to open and overlay, and on the overlay set the leave button to the link in question?
[13:22:41] <Slayed> *open an overlay
[13:22:43] <callumacrae> There are paid lightbox plugins?!
[13:22:47] <callumacrae> What is the world coming to?
[13:23:03] <Slayed> I'll sell you a lightbox plugin. ;)
[13:23:28] * void bought a jquery plugin some time ago. feeling... silly.
[13:23:32] <nkwiatek> is this an appropriate place to ask questions about jquery perchance?
[13:23:47] <callumacrae> nkwiatek: Any channel but this, sorry
[13:23:57] <nkwiatek> ;_;
[13:23:58] <Slayed> I think you are looking for #lisp. this is for lisp questions only.
[13:24:09] <dogarrhea2> u sure it's not #java?
[13:24:25] <Zzaichik> lisp is magical
[13:24:26] <callumacrae> Speaking of java
[13:24:30] <callumacrae> someone left a review on my book
[13:24:31] <callumacrae> http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026280.do
[13:24:31] <nkwiatek> is there a lisp jquery variant
[13:24:32] <dogarrhea2> speaking of "OO" whatever that means these days
[13:24:34] <callumacrae> That's not funny >_<
[13:24:36] <Slayed> dogarrhea2: I forget, did they switch? I thought they weren't doing #java until after they did #wtf
[13:24:45] <phelix> Slayed: Yeah I need to figure out how to not have it open the window on the link until you verify with a button
[13:24:51] <WhoopYeah> Never used a paid jquery plugin before, but saw this http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-lightbox-evolution/full_screen_preview/115655 Thought its pretty nice and haven't seen a free 1 as smooth anywhere else
[13:25:34] <Slayed> phelix: $().click(function(){}) Set the click event to open the overlay, and have the overlay "leave" link to the actual outside link.
[13:25:39] <nkwiatek> alright wiseguys, i need help understanding how "observables" work with deferred and $.when()
[13:26:10] <nkwiatek> i'm trying to understand how $.when($(selector).animate()) works
[13:26:17] <phelix> Slayed: http://jsfiddle.net/s4cXP/1/ this is what i am using now.
[13:26:19] <nkwiatek> when it returns a jQuery object
[13:26:30] <phelix> sorry not to familiar with jquery, not sure how I would add that into my script
[13:26:46] <phelix> so right now when I set the id of #leave on any a link it pops up the window
[13:27:08] <nkwiatek> the reason is that i'm using a silly plugin called gfx() that sort of abstracts css3 anims and has an api like animate(), but i can't use it in $.with() which i need to do
[13:27:17] <dogarrhea2> callumacrae: LOLOLOLOLOL
[13:27:24] <dogarrhea2> what a load of
[13:27:43] <callumacrae> Yeah, I know
[13:27:46] <nkwiatek> and since they both return jquery objects (the result of either $.queue or $.each) i'm not sure what's happening that is different between the two libs
[13:27:47] <callumacrae> I'm not even sure what to flag it as
[13:27:53] <Slayed> callumacrae: I want to learn jave. Teach me your ways.
[13:28:06] <nkwiatek> any idea what's going on or where i should be looking?
[13:28:08] <callumacrae> And codding?
[13:28:17] <Slayed> I know all about codding. I just need instruction on jave.
[13:28:21] <dogarrhea2> maybe he's trying to catch fish with jquery
[13:28:41] <devslash> what do i check off on the jslint site to ignore undefined vars ?
[13:28:51] <Slayed> phelix: can I pm you? the channel is getting busy.
[13:28:57] <phelix> yes please do
[13:29:45] <nkwiatek> anyone? :'(
[13:30:43] <callumacrae> dogarrhea2: I catch fish with jQuery all the time
[13:30:48] <callumacrae> You don't need an entire book on it!
[14:09:23] <Slayed> callumacrae: what kind of hooks do you use to catch fish? Do you tie it to special elements?
[14:09:50] <callumacrae> There's a good error handling library
[14:09:55] <callumacrae> It can catch anything
[14:12:04] <Slayed> I guess the catching isn't the problem, it more trying to handle the what you just caught that is the real issue.

[14:14:33] <saimon69> hi
[14:14:39] <NoiseEee> sorry wrong channel!
[14:14:40] <callumacrae> I only click links with "yolo" in the url if it is followed by "dies"
[14:14:47] <callumacrae> …when that loads, I hope I'm not being insensitive
[14:15:17] <callumacrae> Oh, I am being fairly insensitive
[14:15:19] <saimon69> if i want to wrap two divs with a third div (with the same class) what instructions have to use?
[14:15:41] <NoiseEee> saimon69: .wrapAll
[14:19:03] <saimon69> NoiseEee: can i do sth like $('div.myclass:nth-child(1)'+'div.myclass:nth-child(2)').wrapAll('<div id="myWrapper"></div>');
[14:19:15] <saimon69> or what is the correct syntax?
[14:19:39] <NoiseEee> try it and see?
[14:19:44] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[14:21:11] <saimon69> NoiseEEE: [ ]
[14:21:22] <saimon69> therefore no
[14:21:46] <saimon69> i forgot how can i select more elements at once
[14:21:48] <callumacrae> $('div.myclass:nth-child(1)'+'div.myclass:nth-child(2)') will never match anything
[14:21:54] <callumacrae> seperate the selectors using a comma
[14:22:11] <callumacrae> $('div.myclass:nth-child(1), div.myclass:nth-child(2)')
[14:22:13] <callumacrae> It's just CSS
[14:22:50] <callumacrae> Although this would be better:
[14:22:55] <saimon69> callumacrae: yay \o/
[14:23:08] <callumacrae> $('div.myclass').filter(':nth-child(1), :nth-child(2)')
[14:23:21] <saimon69> interesting
[14:23:29] <callumacrae> Saves having to look up div.myclass multiple times
[14:59:09] <blueadept> anyone know how to compile the latest handlebars code into one file?

[15:04:03] <the_jeebster> hey guys, I've got a custom button element next to a select box dropdown. How can I trigger the select to dropdown when the button is clicked?
[15:04:21] <the_jeebster> focus the element onclick?
[15:06:04] <illourr> the_jeebster: heyo
[15:06:39] <the_jeebster> illourr: hello
[15:06:45] <illourr> the_jeebster: you can just do $('select').trigger('click')  once the button is clicked
[15:06:55] <illourr> or $('select').click()
[15:07:05] <the_jeebster> ah ok, I'll try that out. thanks

[15:32:39] <callen> what's the name of that library that gives you text editor-esque inputs with syntax highlighting?
[15:33:16] <callen> not wysiwyg, but a vanilla text editor that makes it behave less like a textarea and more like an editor...

[16:30:34] <Tobbi__> Hey. Is it not possible to ajax from localhost to some domain, like http://example.org?
[16:30:47] <Tobbi__> (because that fails for me every time)
[16:31:19] <saimon69> Tobbi: no
[16:31:26] <Tobbi__> hmm, ok.
[16:32:06] <saimon69> unless you use maybe XAMPP or a local web server ajax does not work
[16:32:29] <saimon69> if you need cross domain feeding you can use jsonp
[16:32:40] <saimon69> or maybe a php proxy via curl
[16:32:43] <Tobbi__> Even if the data type I expect is HTML?
[16:33:13] <saimon69> ESPECIALLY if is html/xml
[16:33:32] <saimon69> to prevent code injections
[16:34:09] <Tobbi__> okay. So, what will that send back?
[16:34:18] <Tobbi__> I thought it's only for JSON?
[16:34:33] <saimon69> you know what is jsonp?
[16:34:51] <Tobbi__> I know JSON, I thought JSONP might be similar.
[16:34:53] <saimon69> in short is like a funciton call with as parameter the data you want to pass
[16:35:17] <Tobbi__> Alright then I'll try jsonp
[16:35:28] <saimon69> it is, you wrap your JSOn code in a function call
[16:36:06] <saimon69> like ->  myCallBack({"data":"mydata"});
[16:37:05] <saimon69> and you have the callback funciton in the source that parses the data received
[16:37:19] <Tobbi__> nice :)
[16:37:48] <saimon69> or you can still create a 'proxy' script in php, where you call via curl the other domain and then return the result
[16:38:53] <Tobbi__> Yeah, but as this is 'just' an HTML file right now and I intend to keep it like that, I will go with the jsonp thing.
[16:39:40] <saimon69> k

[16:46:19] <Tales1> I have a series of <articles> in an html, i want to click a button and send the first article to the end of the line, how do i do it?
[16:47:48] <tats> good evening
[16:47:55] <Tales1> hello? just checking if someone saw my question
[16:48:27] <Slayed> The end of the line?
[16:49:05] <tats> i coded a simple hovering menu with jquery here: http://perte-de-signal.org/artiste/ however when scrolling there are glitches in the image (on both Chromium and Safari).
[16:49:30] <tats> is there a way to fix this?
[16:50:57] <Slayed> tats: What do you mean glitches in the image? I gave it a quick look and it seems like the site is working.
[16:51:06] <Tales1> i don't see any glitches
[16:51:10] <Tales1> looks nice
[16:51:29] <Tales1> you want the image to stay in position?
[16:52:12] <Slayed> Tales1: what do you mean you want to send the first article to the end of the line? What line?
[16:52:20] <tats> when i scroll down the page, the menu with the artist names stays static... but when i scroll relatively "fast" there are flickerings, the menu doesn't always adjust fast enough
[16:53:49] <Slayed> tats: Ok, I see what you mean. You could just set the menu to be fixed and sit at the top of the page.
[16:54:26] <tats> Slayed: no cause i need it to start following the scroll only when we scroll past the header/title
[16:54:41] <tawmmy> Tales1: append or appendTo?
[16:55:17] <Tales1> Slayed i mean kind of sort the articles, send the one that is first to the bottom:  i have this list: banana pear peach pineapple after click i want pear peach pineapple banana
[16:55:43] <Tales1> each element is wrapped in <article>banana</article>
[16:58:11] <Tales1> i found this plugin, but is not exactly what i need http://qd9.co.uk/projects/jQuery-Plugins/sort/demo.html
[16:59:46] <saimon69> anybody know how to do extensive text replace in jquery?
[17:02:13] <tawmmy> Tales1: append/appendTo does what you're looking for
[17:03:45] <Slayed> Tales1: To piggyback on tawmmy, here's the function: http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[17:10:56] <someprimetime> how can i assign $.slideUp('fast'); to a variable?
[17:12:08] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Uh, what?
[17:13:07] <someprimetime> well instead of having to do an if (settings.slide === true) { $(this).slideUp('fast'); } else { $(this).hide(); } i wanted to assign it to a variable and just call that on it like $(this).close() <-- which is either slideUp() or hide()
[17:13:19] <someprimetime> does that make sense?
[17:13:53] <Eviltwin> Where is settings coming from?
[17:15:22] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/nNDq9/3/
[17:15:49] <someprimetime> it'll always be default but if i want to turn it off, i'd like it to use hide()/show() instead
[17:16:37] <saimon69> this expression: $('div.footer_map div.map_text').each(function(){
[17:16:37] <saimon69> $(this).html($(this).html().replace('|','&'))
[17:16:37] <saimon69> });
[17:17:00] <saimon69> just replace the first instance of '|', how can i make it replace all '|'?
[17:17:21] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: .replace(/\|/g,'&')
[17:17:31] <someprimetime> that's @saimon69
[17:17:41] <saimon69> lemme try
[17:17:43] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I hit S<TAB>
[17:17:58] <someprimetime> no worries it feels good to have my name called
[17:20:35] <Tales1> i couldn't figure it out :S
[17:20:44] <Tales1> so far i have this:
[17:21:46] <Tales1> 	var $jqlist = $jq( "section#profiles" );
[17:21:47] <Tales1> 	var $jqlistLi = $jq( "article.employee-card", $jqlist );
[17:21:48] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I think you want something like function close(elem) { if (settings.slide === true) { $(elem).slideUp('fast'); } else { $(elem).hide(); } }
[17:21:51] <Eviltwin> Then close(this);
[17:22:05] <someprimetime> ah
[17:22:11] <someprimetime> damn
[17:22:15] <someprimetime> i felt like i was close
[17:22:16] <someprimetime> thanks Eviltwin
[17:22:43] <Tales1> now... i have $jqlistLi is an array with all the articles
[17:23:35] <Tales1> i want to take the first element of the array and append it to the array again then unset the first element of the array, right?
[17:29:27] <Slayed> Tales1: http://jsfiddle.net/s4cXP/9/
[17:30:26] <Slayed> I think that is what you want.
[17:32:10] <Slayed> Well, except change the click to only fire on the first article.
[17:40:37] <Tales1> gee thanks, it does what i need :D
[17:40:41] <Tales1> i was doing this:
[17:40:51] <Tales1> $jq( "#move-up" ).click( function(){
[17:40:52] <Tales1> 	var list = $jq( "article.employee-card" );
[17:40:52] <Tales1> 	var toMove = list[ 0 ];
[17:40:52] <Tales1> 	list.splice( 0, 1 );
[17:40:52] <Tales1> 	list.push( toMove );
[17:40:52] <Tales1> 	alert( list );
[17:40:56] <Tales1> } );
[17:40:59] <coldhead> sweet past bro
[17:41:01] <coldhead> paste*
[17:42:20] <Tales1> so append removes the element and pastes it?
[17:42:35] <coldhead> append moves, rather than copies
[17:43:17] <Tales1> good
[17:45:48] <Tales1> $jq( "#move-up" ).click( function(){
[17:45:48] <Tales1> 	var list = $jq( "article.employee-card" );
[17:45:48] <Tales1> 	var toMove = list[ 0 ];
[17:45:48] <Tales1> 	$jq( toMove ).appendTo( "section#profiles" );
[17:45:48] <Tales1> } );
[17:45:59] <Tales1> thanks a lot... it's working
[17:48:16] <Tales1> i guess prepend does the contrary, right?
[17:48:26] <Whirl3d> Hey all, anybody know of a good collaborative outlining systems that use jquery?
[17:49:52] <coldhead> well deduced, Tales1

[18:19:27] <gavin_huang> hey, coldhead
[18:19:55] <rmurphey> mgl: you are looking for "placeholder text"
[18:20:05] <rmurphey> text that is replaced when you focus an input
[18:21:22] <rmurphey> https://github.com/ginader/HTML5-placeholder-polyfill
[18:21:48] <mgl> rmurphey: iam looking for how make that action
[18:23:56] <raj> hey coldhead, how goes it?
[18:24:15] <Tales1> is there a way to make element.animate() appear from lower to upper?
[18:24:38] <coldhead> it's adequate, raj
[18:24:49] <coldhead> strictly adequate
[18:41:09] <Tales1> is there a way to show an element from bottom to top? tried slideDown, slideToggle, animate... noe seems to work for bottom to top display
[18:47:10] <haizum> hmm i have a callback function running after an animation is completed, and there seems to be like a 1-2 second delay until it runs, any idea why?
[18:47:33] <raj> coldhead, I didn't ask how it's hanging ;)
[18:48:06] <coldhead> i am very glad you didn't
[18:48:11] <coldhead> that is not somewhere we want to go
[18:48:13] <coldhead> as a community
[18:48:16] <coldhead> or a species
[18:48:29] <coldhead> i was just saying as much to my parole officer
[18:50:01] <raj> lmao
[18:50:17] <sent-hil> is there an alternative to $x.append(...).trigger("create"), I'm seeing some weird beh.?
[18:50:24] <raj> your PO, as they say in the skreets
[18:57:34] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all is there a way to animate this $(this).dialog('option', 'position', 'center'); i would like the dialog to slide from where it is to the new position
[19:10:26] <jcp_> i need to draw a line from one div to another to another, etc. is there a way to do this with jquery without using like canvas or some graph plugin where you can't really alter the appearance
[19:12:19] <alexr2> jcp_ http://jsfiddle.net/kDs2Q/45/
[19:13:08] <jcp_> hmm yea, but it's like 50 different objects so i imagine that's going to be pretty complex
[19:13:21] <alexr2> drawing lines with jquery is complex
[19:13:25] <alexr2> much easier to do with canvas
[19:13:46] <azbyin> hi all.. should I use $("selector").change(function() { myfunc(); });  or simply $("selector").change(myfunc) ?
[19:13:55] <azbyin> i don;t need to pass any args to myfunc
[19:14:08] <jcp_> alexr2: do you have a preferred plugin or something for drawing scatter plots? i need to be able to edit the table layout and make the points interactive though
[19:14:18] <coldhead> jcp_: last time i did it i used long thin divs with a bg colour and rotated and positioned them with CSS
[19:14:27] <Whirl3d> gnite all
[19:14:46] <alexr2> jcp_ I've used highcharts before
[19:15:07] <alexr2> I know google has a plugin that I'm planning to try out on an upcoming project
[19:15:25] <jcp_> alexr2: i'm looking at that now actually. is it highly customizable in terms of appearance? i didn't see any documentation about themeing it
[19:15:35] <alexr2> jcp_ yeah, it's super customizable
[19:15:55] <alexr2> http://www.highcharts.com/demo/
[19:15:55] <coldhead> too customizable?
[19:16:03] <alexr2> coldhead, possibly haha
[19:16:40] <alexr2> jcp_ a lot of people have done a lot of stuff for it.  You can find pretty much anything you want on stackoverflow for it
[19:16:57] <jcp_> alexr2: yea, i'll have to google some more thanks
[19:17:12] <alexr2> azbyin is right though, you may want to just do it with css
[19:18:02] <azbyin> huh?
[19:18:20] <azbyin> you mean coldhead ?
[19:18:28] <alexr2> ahh
[19:18:29] <alexr2> yes i do
[19:18:30] <alexr2> haha
[19:19:11] <jcp_> the issue with css is that my charts are dynamic
[19:19:23] <coldhead> azbyin is often right too
[19:19:26] <jcp_> users can add new data points
[19:19:27] <azbyin> :)
[19:19:41] <alexr2> jcp_ it doesn't have to be static css, you can just add the stuff dynamically with the help of js
[19:20:11] <jcp_> I'm not even sure how'd id do the css lines. coldhead do you have a demo of that online?
[19:20:28] <coldhead> i actually did it for a friend, lemme see if i can find the URL
[19:20:45] <jcp_> thanks
[19:20:52] <azbyin> jcp_, i think of these situations leading to 2 possibilities: (1) if you need to query the drawing element(s) to determine where they are or how big they are or to click on them, etc. use svg, (2) otherwise use canvas
[19:21:25] <azbyin> i.e. use canvas if you want to simply add stuff and display stuff. any time you want more than simple querying of whatever exists, use svg
[19:21:45] <azbyin> also note that svg will be slow any time you have a large set of elements
[19:22:44] <jcp_> svg browser support is lacking right?
[19:22:55] <alexr2> azbyin, I don't see a reason you would do function() { myfunc();}
[19:22:58] <coldhead> jcp_: i can only find this proof of concept http://jsbin.com/omoluk/2/edit
[19:23:55] <azbyin> jcp_, a canvas cannot tell you what is shown. you have to keep state yourself. Also, interaction is a little bit involved even for simple click events
[19:24:06] <jcp_> coldhead: hmmm, interesting, that may work for me
[19:24:06] <alexr2> azbyin, http://jsfiddle.net/ANXLE/ works fine
[19:24:48] <azbyin> jcp_, you have to decide between the 2. i always decide based on the amount of interactivity needed and the complexity ofthe shapes being drawn
[19:25:20] <azbyin> alexr2, i was not asking which of the 2 forms would work. i was asking which is preferable :)
[19:25:28] <alexr2> ahh
[19:26:20] <alexr2> I dunno if there's a standard for it.
[19:26:50] <coldhead> there are standards for everything!
[19:28:47] <azbyin> iirc, you're supposed to pass a function object. the function name itself is obviously a function object. but i believe the js engines can even resolve "funcname" (string literal) to the right obj
[19:28:59] <jcp_> azbyin: they're just straight lines for now but i could eventually need curved lines. the css technique may be a good fallback but i'll try high charts first. svg/canvas doesn't have the browser support i need yet (i don't think?)
[19:29:41] <azbyin> jcp_, what? canvas is supported pretty well. and if you are going to use canvas, use processing.js, raphael or something similar
[19:29:48] <azbyin> don;t use the canvas api by yourself
[19:30:02] <coldhead> svg is everywhere
[19:30:05] <azbyin> too much hassle as it provides very little by itself
[19:30:11] <azbyin> yup, svg should work fine too
[19:30:21] <azbyin> ie>=9 iirc
[19:30:29] <azbyin> or did it work fine in ie8 ?
[19:30:49] <jcp_> svg works in ie 8?
[19:31:21] <alexr2> I've stopped supporting ie, I've just given up
[19:31:26] <jcp_> haha i wish
[19:31:29] <coldhead> hi5
[19:31:52] <azbyin> alexr2, ie9+ is not too bad. but i never write anything specifically for ie
[19:31:58] <coldhead> at the risk of sounding like a fascist, people who don't bother upgrading to a decent browser don't deserve the web
[19:32:04] <alexr2> haha
[19:32:06] <jcp_> hahah
[19:32:10] <coldhead> say what you like about the fascists but they made the bloody trains run on time
[19:32:35] <azbyin> coldhead, i believe it was kogan(online business) that started adding a few dollars to the price of each item
[19:32:43] <coldhead> that's the best thing ever
[19:32:49] <azbyin> but *only* for people visiting the site with IE
[19:32:57] <coldhead> i consider that best practice
[19:33:01] <coldhead> IE surcharge
[19:33:08] <coldhead> a tax on stupidity
[19:33:21] <alexr2> Generally when I do things, there's always a popup that says, you're on an old browser, use these links blah blah blah
[19:33:27] <azbyin> the reason was "supporting IE is increasing our costs, so we will charge you extra if you are using an outdated browser"
[19:33:33] <alexr2> let them use it, but don't bother putting in the extra ton of hours
[19:35:38] <coldhead> no one really visits sites other than facebook anyway :(
[19:37:46] <tw2113> there are sites besides facebook?
[19:37:50] <coldhead> exactly
[20:01:32] <r1card> I want to make a link that doesn't act upon it's href (for testing). I have .click(function() { return false; } ) <- not working. Ideas?
[20:02:54] <coldhead> i would expect that to work
[20:03:07] <coldhead> try an alert('lol') in there just to see if the handler is working at all
[20:03:20] <coldhead> and for the official way to not follow links use ?preventDefault
[20:03:21] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[20:03:36] <r1card> Hmmm, it does. coldhead. So something in my animate code stops it. No errors in the console tho.
[20:04:00] <coldhead> curiouser and curiouser
[20:04:15] <r1card> coldhead, btw can I animate between two classes?
[20:04:21] <r1card> coldhead, it's be a lot more manageable.
[20:04:34] <r1card> two CSS selectors, in other words.
[20:04:59] <coldhead> you can
[20:05:02] <coldhead> but you need a plugin
[20:05:08] <r1card> Can you recommend a good one?
[20:05:13] <coldhead> there's one in jQuery UI
[20:05:17] <coldhead> if you're already using that
[20:05:26] <r1card> Nope. I'll check it.
[20:05:38] <coldhead> http://jqueryui.com/demos/switchClass/
[20:06:11] <r1card> Thanks coldhead.
[20:06:20] <r1card> As for my issue, if I add this: $('#nav a').animate({ fontSize: '14px', color: '#a5a5a5'}, 400);
[20:06:26] <r1card> return false stops having effect.
[20:06:30] <r1card> :{
[20:07:00] <r1card> coldhead, do you see mistakes?
[20:08:18] <coldhead> not at all
[20:08:21] <coldhead> that is very mysterious
[20:08:32] <coldhead> can you recreate this on jsbin or jsfiddle?
[20:11:48] <azbyin> r1card, return false where??
[20:11:58] <r1card> azariah, in a .click() handler
[20:12:03] <r1card> azbyin, ^
[20:12:05] <r1card> azariah pardon
[20:12:13] <azbyin> and where is the animate setup ?
[20:12:20] <r1card> same place.
[20:12:54] <Stampy> Using .getJson, how can I specify a handler for a specific HTTP status code?
[20:13:03] <azbyin> so you want click on any link to animate the font and then only on certain ones the link is actually followed?
[20:13:27] <r1card> azbyin, it's for debugging, I'll eventually remove it, but if it keeps reloading the page I can't test anything.
[20:13:37] <azbyin> make a testcase on jsfiddle or jsbin as coldhead said
[20:14:32] <r1card> :( Now it works somehow.
[20:14:35] <r1card> Damn you JS gods!
[20:14:36] <r1card> :D
[20:14:38] <r1card>  Thanks folks.
[20:28:59] <ale_> Hello! Does someone know how to make a jquery button work as a link??
[20:41:45] <devslash> Eviltwin: hey
[20:41:53] <r1card> coldhead, I've tried switchClass, it works, but noticable jerkier than animate. Ideas? Maybe hardcoded FPS?
[20:42:17] <Eviltwin> devslash: Hey
[20:42:48] <devslash> that jlint thing was helpful but also a pain in the ass
[20:43:12] <r1card> devslash, it doesn't just catch errors, it enforces its own type of zealotry.
[20:43:18] <devslash> yea
[20:43:24] <Eviltwin> I use a massively tweaked jshint
[20:43:42] <Eviltwin> In combination with a project a friend of mine worked on called fixMyJS
[20:43:45] <devslash> one good thing that came out of it is that it found all my if statements that weren't wrapped in squiggly brackets and I added them
[20:43:56] <Eviltwin> So it can actually fix some of these things for you
[20:44:06] <devslash> Eviltwin: does fixmyJS have a way to ignore undefined variables
[20:44:18] <Eviltwin> It only fixes things that jshint bitches about
[20:44:23] <Eviltwin> So if you turn off that option for jshint
[20:44:23] <devslash> i tried 2 different sites and both had issues with that because of jQuery
[20:44:26] <Eviltwin> Then it doesn't try to fix it
[20:44:33] <devslash> its broken
[20:44:46] <devslash> it still reported undefined variables even after i unselected it
[20:47:45] <devslash> Eviltwin: thats been one of my biggest issues with jlint. that and that it returns errors for things that are syntactically correct jquery code
[20:53:47] <r1card> animate() is *way* smoother than switchClass, ideas?
[21:22:07] <coldhead> switchClass should be using animate internally
[21:22:25] <coldhead> but if it's not optimised for your usecase you should just use animate(), right?
[21:22:30] <coldhead> that's what i'd do
[21:22:38] <coldhead> and i'm a professional developer
[21:44:12] <r1card> coldhead, I'd rather say it's buggy.
[21:44:33] <r1card> coldhead, I have two classes with exactly 3 (different) properties. fontSize, lineHeight, color.
[21:45:02] <r1card> coldhead, I checked the code, it is using animate differently, so the problem is likely the function parsing out the properties to animate.
[21:45:19] <coldhead> it's trying to animate all possible properties
[21:45:19] <r1card> coldhead, if it's having worse framerate, it means it's animating a lot more properties than it needs to.
[21:45:31] <coldhead> but if you only need 3 you can write that yourself easy enough
[21:45:35] <r1card> Right, but it has a function that's supposed to filter out only those having a delta
[21:45:39] <coldhead> just steal their code and take out the bits you don't need
[21:45:40] <r1card> So basically it's buggy
[21:45:47] <r1card> but I have no time to I didn't inspect further today
[21:46:01] <r1card> coldhead, I went animate() manually
[21:46:03] <coldhead> if only jQuery UI were free software so you could fix it and submit a patch :)
[21:46:13] <coldhead> yes that's what i'd do
[21:46:15] <r1card> coldhead, if only I had time.
[21:46:20] <coldhead> of course, of course
[21:46:23] <coldhead> i am being facetious
[21:46:30] <coldhead> number of patches submitted by coldhead: 0
[21:46:42] <r1card> Huh, then we're 1:0 ;)
[21:46:45] <coldhead> number of bug reports: 0
[21:46:58] <coldhead> instances of useless moaning: countless thousands
[21:47:21] <coldhead> although today i replied to a spam email so that's something
[21:54:58] <DrPoole> hello
[21:55:05] <DrPoole> im about to blow my fucking brains out
[21:55:06] <DrPoole> how are you guys?
[21:55:25] <DrPoole> http://pastebin.com/3LV7Mzwy
[21:55:31] <DrPoole> cant get at that json object to save my life
[21:55:35] <coldhead> much the same but less obnoxious about it
[21:55:49] <DrPoole> yeah well ... anything worth doing is worth using my whole ass for it
[21:56:02] <coldhead> are you trying to get JSON from another domain?
[21:56:18] <DrPoole> yeah but it's all worked out and it's fine on others (same page, same domain)
[21:56:24] <DrPoole> my problem is this json has another layer
[21:56:45] <DrPoole> same page im using a different call (same domain) and using SiteKit.Foobar
[21:56:47] <DrPoole> which is the array
[21:56:49] <DrPoole> no problem
[21:57:01] <DrPoole> this is giving me issues (it seems) because of SiteKit.Transactions.transaction
[21:57:05] <DrPoole> that extra layer
[21:57:08] <DrPoole> i just ... i dont get it
[21:57:14] <DrPoole> tried every variation
[21:57:34] <coldhead> instead of this alert() business i would try console.log(data) and then console.log(data.Transactions) and so on
[21:57:43] <DrPoole> respectable.  trying.
[21:57:47] <coldhead> until i could work out where my typing was breaking
[21:58:26] <DrPoole> as soon as i get into the each() it says jquery.js failed.  can't read .length
[21:58:57] <coldhead> and the JSON is definitely valid?
[21:58:59] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[21:58:59] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[21:59:06] <DrPoole> says it's fine
[21:59:11] <coldhead> hrumph!
[21:59:23] <coldhead> before the each
[21:59:25] <coldhead> i'd try
[21:59:28] <anda> hello
[21:59:30] <DrPoole> not my first rodeo ... or ... thought it wasn't until i was dominated by this god damn thing
[21:59:42] <coldhead> console.log(data, data.SiteKit, data.SiteKit.Transactions)
[21:59:49] <coldhead> and make sure those guys are cool
[22:00:35] <DrPoole> i...didnt know console.log would take multiple arguments like that
[22:00:39] <DrPoole> nice one!
[22:00:50] <coldhead> one of its many charms :)
[22:02:43] <coldhead> hallo anda
[22:03:56] * DrPoole smiles and calmly loads his gun
[22:04:07] <coldhead> dude it isn't worth it
[22:04:13] <coldhead> you have much worse to endure yet
[22:04:15] <DrPoole> it seems somebody changed the json url i was fetching
[22:04:19] <coldhead> HAHAHAH
[22:04:20] <DrPoole> now i am the only dev
[22:04:21] <DrPoole> so
[22:04:25] <DrPoole> it was obviously a ghost of sorts
[22:04:30] <DrPoole> we should get the bottom of this
[22:04:31] <DrPoole> bottle
[22:04:35] <DrPoole> before suicide
[22:05:01] <DrPoole> i suck at life.  thank you for your help.
[22:05:17] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your days, DrPoole
[22:05:23] <DrPoole> day
[22:05:24] <DrPoole> thanks
[22:21:57] <anda> anyone who could look at little bit of code, im having problem to call ajax page
[22:22:09] <anda> not really sure whats wrong
[22:23:01] <coldhead> i can't see any problems so far
[22:23:15] * coldhead looks harder
[22:23:21] <anda> coldhead let me make a paste
[22:23:31] <coldhead> please
[22:27:36] <anda> coldhead http://pastebin.com/8GbYWutZ
[22:27:46] <anda> ask me any questions please
[22:27:56] <coldhead> what is your favourite color
[22:28:27] <anda> lol its blue actully
[22:28:40] <coldhead> this looks wrong to me: document.getElementById('.write_button').clicked
[22:28:55] <coldhead> it looks like you are trying to get something with id=".write_button"
[22:29:01] <coldhead> which is weird
[22:29:25] <anda> this is the class of the submit button
[22:29:34] <coldhead> surely you want $('#write_button')[0].clicked or $('.write_button')[0].clicked
[22:30:04] <anda> oh ok i will fix this
[22:30:42] <anda> should i test it?
[22:31:28] <coldhead> you must
[22:31:36] <anda> ok give me a sec
[22:32:11] <coldhead> anda: usually if you want to do something when an element is clicked you write a click() handler
[22:32:21] <coldhead> which takes a function to run when the click happens
[22:32:29] <coldhead> rather than testing if something is clicked yourself
[22:33:39] <coldhead> like this, anda http://jsfiddle.net/5UUq7/
[22:34:18] <aberrant> anyone use thejit.js?
[22:35:11] <anda> ok i will change that to do this cuz the other one wont work
[22:39:52] <anda> coldhead let me make the alert to test if it works cuz i cant tell really
[22:40:09] <anda> seems like its faster when i click the button
[22:40:21] <anda> but message isnt displaying

[22:50:28] <buddyq> hi guys, I am wanting to use jquery mobile for the mobile look of my site, however, the more I dive into this, it seems that the best practice is to have a desktop version of html pages and one for mobile. Is this correct?
[22:50:45] <coldhead> anda: what you're doing should throw JS errors
[22:50:46] <aberrant> does anyone have time to help with a general javascript problem?
[22:50:51] <coldhead> you should see them in your JS console
[22:50:59] <coldhead> and if you're not checking your JS console you should be
[22:51:12] <anda> ok let me check

[22:56:19] <anda> let me test it

[23:00:35] <anda> no errors in the consle now butt still its not doing anything
[23:01:45] <coldhead> anda: you might need to use ?ready
[23:01:46] <bot-t> anda, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[23:01:48] <coldhead> around your code
[23:02:06] <coldhead> or if that's too confusing change .click() to .live('click', ...
[23:02:38] <Eviltwin> Eww
[23:02:52] <anda> ok i will chnage this to live
[23:03:23] <coldhead> oh Eviltwin is here, just do whatever he says
[23:03:35] <coldhead> i have to go get beer for the teamsters
[23:08:11] <anda> missing ; before statement  i have something like $('write_button').live('click'){ then the .post funtion inside}
[23:10:06] <anda> Eviltwin hey
[23:14:17] <Ghost1227> ok... so here's step three in the process. i've been working on a problem which has boiled down to loading a css file through jQuery. basically as such - `$("head").append($("<link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' type='text/css' media='screen' />"));` problem is that i can't figure out how to reference the css file properly. the js file is at http://www.example.com/foo/js/example.js and the css is http://www.example.com/foo/css/example.
[23:14:17] <Ghost1227> css
[23:14:19] <Ghost1227> thoughts?
[23:17:07] <Spikes> can you use absolute path?  http://www.example.com/foo/css/style.css?
[23:17:31] <Spikes> you could also try "../css/style.css"
[23:19:43] <Ghost1227> ../ didn't work
[23:20:06] <Ghost1227> although on second thought, it's only a single line of css... why not just append it instead of the link?
[23:21:03] <Already> Hi! Would anybody be able to tell me how to write function that has a definition like that func(a,b,c) which i can call like this func(a:"abc",c:"abc")? So I'm able to "skip" paramerts?
[23:21:36] <Spikes> Ghost1227, yeah, no reason to use file in that case
[23:23:01] <tw2113> Already, you mean set defaults?
[23:24:06] <Spikes> Already, i think you'll have to use object as a function attribute
[23:25:21] <Already> tw2113 kind of. I do have a set of default values but is there a way to "skip" paramters which should keep those default values?
[23:25:51] <tw2113> i would think you could do it the same way plugins tend to
[23:25:52] <Already> Spikes so I need to pass a object which contains the paramters or what do you mean?
[23:26:06] <tw2113> inside do a merge of yours plus defaults, and it'd get all mapped correctly
[23:27:11] <coldhead> anda: paste us the JS code you have currently
[23:27:18] <coldhead> you can do this
[23:27:21] <coldhead> i promise
[23:27:32] <Already> OK. *looks for the how to write plugins docs* Might be worth a look. :) Thanks tw2113.
[23:28:09] <tw2113> ?extend @ Already
[23:28:09] <bot-t> Already, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[23:28:13] <Spikes> Already, http://jsfiddle.net/79QFG/1/

[23:29:38] <Already> So much support, thank you! :D
[23:29:59] <Spikes> Already, using example above you could use function like that: "abc({b:2});" and result would be "{a:0, b:2, c:0}";
[23:31:15] <Already> Cool. Exactly what i was looking for!
[23:31:31] <anda> coldhead one moment
[23:31:39] <tw2113> yes! i was able to help in here
[23:34:49] <anda> http://pastebin.com/z61DHSCR this is what i have now
[23:36:16] <Spikes> anda, uh, man. You should use single quotes and double quotes so you won't have to escape attributes:  echo '<div id="message_frame">'...
[23:37:03] <anda> yeah i know,i realized that later on where almost all my php code is wiht "" quotes
[23:37:13] <coldhead> goddamn it, anda, help us to help you
[23:37:21] <coldhead> i told you you can't have that "if" on line 18
[23:37:30] <coldhead> and i rewrote it for you without it
[23:37:36] <coldhead> >>>: |
[23:37:41] <coldhead> let's get drunk in this club
[23:37:44] <coldhead> woo spring break
[23:37:49] <coldhead> surf party usa
[23:37:49] <coldhead> etc
[23:38:10] <anda> oh sorry i forgot to edit this also
[23:38:19] <anda> its not there in my oryingal cody
[23:39:45] <anda> http://pastebin.com/EBH1vvPF
[23:39:46] <coldhead> so we need to see the actual code that is breaking for you :)
[23:40:46] <anda> basically there is no html, all it is its php
[23:40:47] <coldhead> anda: http://pastebin.com/DZN3AYRu
[23:41:06] <coldhead> i got rid of that message function because you don't even seem to be calling it
[23:41:08] <anda> where i did echo out like the message frame that i posted
[23:41:16] <anda> ok
[23:41:17] <coldhead> and i wrapped it in a ready() because that's what you might need
[23:41:29] <anda> ok thank you, im gonna try this
[23:41:34] <anda> give me one moment
[23:47:02] <anda> coldhead, it says on line 18 <missing ; before the statement
[23:48:52] <tw2113> so fix that
[23:48:54] <tw2113> put in a ;
[23:49:37] <coldhead> anda: http://jsfiddle.net/V8Sky/
[23:49:41] <coldhead> that code works
[23:49:47] <coldhead> except it can't find "str"
[23:49:53] <coldhead> which apparently exists somewhere
[23:49:58] <coldhead> in some code you aren't showing us
[23:50:07] <coldhead> in conclusion, it all works perfectly in my imagination
[23:50:08] <coldhead> and good day
[23:50:12] <anda> ohh this isnt even used it this one
[23:50:25] <anda> this was supposed to be for the live search
[23:50:32] <anda> we arent using this

[23:56:41] <anda> thanks
[23:56:49] <coldhead> i would love to believe you're actually TRYING to understand what you're doing
[23:56:53] <coldhead> but you make it so hard
