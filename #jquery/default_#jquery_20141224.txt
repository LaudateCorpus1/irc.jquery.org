[01:12:00] <allesan> hello
[01:13:04] <allesan> i have a code that pulls data from db, generates groups of checkboxes which I have to update into database with new checkboxes selected
[01:13:42] <allesan> i'm doing update with ajax calling the outside update.php file, and that is working fine
[01:13:59] <allesan> but only my first update link/ajax is working
[01:14:47] <allesan> update for all the subsequent groups of checkboxes doesn't even call the update.php file
[01:16:05] <Ayub_> hi
[01:16:39] <Ayub_> Could some one suggest me a jquery plugin to support file upload cross domain
[01:17:12] <blackkbot> jsonp
[01:17:18] <Ayub_> I am using jquery form plugin however the issue I have is that I do not have access to the response returned from server
[01:18:11] <Ayub_> blackkbot: jsonp is data type right ?
[01:18:14] <blackkbot> https://jsonp.nodejitsu.com/
[01:18:18] <blackkbot> json proxy
[01:18:30] <Ayub_> ok.. let me try I am using this http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[01:19:45] <Ayub_> blackkbot: can I do file upload as well ?
[01:20:51] <blackkbot> the same way to upload using html
[01:21:26] <Ayub_> blackkbot: I want to do file upload using ajax
[01:21:38] <blackkbot> submit the form via an iframe that isn't visible
[01:21:54] <blackkbot> or jquery has ajax functions
[01:22:11] <Ayub_> the issue I have is the response returned cannot be accessed when done using iframe
[01:23:53] <Ayub_> blackkbot: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/ plugin is using iframe to submit the file upload..I can see the response in IE debug tools
[01:23:58] <Ayub_> however the response object is lost in the call back methods
[01:28:05] <kubanc> Hello, Is it OK if i put  if(jQuery(this).attr("href") == "/d9/{Slika oglasa:path}"). is the string that is inside equals ("/d9/{Slika oglasa:path}") OK, or do I need to use special characters?
[01:29:43] <allesan> i have a code that pulls data from db, generates groups of checkboxes which I have to update into database with new checkboxes selected.i'm doing update with ajax calling the outside update.php file, and that is working fine. but only my first update link/ajax is working, update for all the subsequent groups of checkboxes doesn't even call the update.php file
[01:33:08] <Francis> How do I bind the droppable event to dynamically created nodes?
[01:34:48] <Francis> hey plz help
[01:34:48] <Francis> i struck on this
[01:35:15] <Francis> http://jsfiddle.net/3vt1w9r3/11/
[01:35:15] <Francis> if any one plz
[01:35:30] <Francis> is there any one who sort out my problem plz
[01:48:29] <silverscream> hey! i know it's kinda offtopic but probably answered quick by you freenode veterans: is there any way to change the _username_ after registered?
[01:50:05] <Francis> yes it' possible
[01:51:40] <Francis> https://freenode.net/faq.shtml check it out
[01:52:08] <allesan> i have a code that pulls data from db, generates groups of checkboxes which I have to update into database with new checkboxes selected.i'm doing update with ajax calling the outside update.php file, and that is working fine. but only my first update link/ajax is working, update for all the subsequent groups of checkboxes doesn't even call the update.php file
[01:57:57] <Ayub_> any cross domain experts here ?
[01:58:38] <blackkbot> what a strange question... when does someone use the internet without going cross domain
[01:59:08] <sahbeewah_> allesan: could be many reasons, post/fiddle some code
[02:00:54] <blackkbot> because jquery only calls the functions with each element when the function is called .. so if the elements don't exist when the event listener is added to the elements with the class of xyz and more xyz elements are added those elements do not have the the same event listeners
[02:04:07] <Francis> hey is there any way to bind the elements with droppable one
[02:04:16] <Francis> http://jsfiddle.net/3vt1w9r3/11/
[02:04:29] <Francis> plz help if anyone know
[02:06:50] <Francis> ask me if you don't understand the question
[02:31:46] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[02:48:38] <Francis> hiu
[02:59:47] <samu> Hi
[02:59:53] <samu> has anybody tried to compress jquery using yui?
[02:59:53] <arthurvr> Hi!
[03:00:12] <blackkbot> jquery.min.js is compressed jquery right?
[03:00:21] <samu> yeah, but I have a specific use case here
[03:00:27] <samu> I have, like, a dozen of small javascript files.
[03:00:35] <blackkbot> browserify?
[03:00:44] <samu> so I picked up uncompressed jquery and compressed it - along wih other small files - using yui
[03:01:02] <arthurvr> yeah, and didn’t it worked?
[03:01:13] <samu> well, not really. So, just a quick background
[03:01:25] <arthurvr> can you give me the version number you used
[03:01:31] <blackkbot> you would rather a slow background?
[03:01:34] <blackkbot> lol :P
[03:01:52] <arthurvr> of jquery I mean
[03:01:55] <samu> so, at first: 1) clean 'combined.js', 2) iterate over all javascript files and do cat $file >> combined.js
[03:02:06] <Ayub_> can some one help me with cross domain file upload ?
[03:02:14] <samu> then I run yuicompressor-2.4.8 on combined.js and produce a minified.js
[03:02:18] <samu> and include that in a document.
[03:02:29] <arthurvr> yeah but maybe the problem was the order
[03:02:35] <samu> jquery is first.
[03:02:51] <arthurvr> okay
[03:02:56] <blackkbot> browserify...
[03:03:03] <arthurvr> but what version of jquery I want to try manually?
[03:03:08] <blackkbot> i believe it was built for this
[03:03:47] <samu> I will look at browserify in a second, currently I want to fight with yui. I cannot left this battle being defeat.
[03:03:58] <samu> arthurvr: v1.10.2
[03:04:04] <arthurvr> yeah man, btw browserify isn’t ideal in all cases
[03:04:16] <arthurvr> I’il try, samu
[03:04:44] <samu> well, I don't want anything that works on client side.
[03:05:11] <samu> yui seems good for it - I work on my code at devel, then compress it just before pushing to production
[03:06:42] <arthurvr> http://jsfiddle.net/za1pwajk/
[03:06:45] <arthurvr> working
[03:06:58] <arthurvr> so it’s a problem with your scripts or your order
[03:07:13] <samu> hm. yeah, that's weird.
[03:07:18] <arthurvr> (btw, if you can just use uglify)
[03:07:33] <arthurvr> or it’s a problem while concatinating
[03:07:48] <arthurvr> can be too
[03:07:58] <samu> yeah, might be.
[03:08:14] <arthurvr> like if I concat ”var a = 4” which is valid javascript
[03:08:15] <samu> but what's weird though
[03:08:25] <arthurvr> with ”var b = 4” which is also valid
[03:08:29] <samu> is that I have '$' in my browser
[03:08:33] <samu> and all jquery goodies.
[03:08:33] <samu> ;D
[03:08:40] <arthurvr> i get ”var a = 4var b = 4”
[03:08:43] <arthurvr> which is syntax error
[03:08:44] <samu> but yeah, I think I can just force a new line
[03:08:49] <samu> in concatination
[03:09:14] <arthurvr> anyhow have fun, I’m afk
[03:09:19] <samu> well, that didn't work
[03:09:27] <samu> the combined.js file is different, obviously, but yui generated the same thing
[03:09:28] <samu> ;D
[03:13:29] <samu> arthurvr: so I tried uglify, but I still get the same error
[03:13:29] <samu> :F
[03:14:32] <samu> and what is weird
[03:15:31] <samu> http://wstaw.org/m/2014/12/24/zrzut.png
[03:15:32] <samu> check this out.
[03:16:07] <samu> it complains about $ not being defined, when it is. the first script is included after my minimized version of jquery. And now, just for test, I included only jquery for uglify. (and yeah, this one I tried with uglify)
[03:24:30] <joroc> do you have full code?
[03:25:26] <samu> well, I can't really give you access to internal vpn, but I'm trying to carve it out and make it public
[03:25:58] <arthurvr> it’s just the order not being right
[03:26:19] <arthurvr> The first scripts that execute don’t have access to jquery
[03:26:50] <arthurvr> Maybe jquery is first in that file, but do you include others <script>’s in that document?
[03:26:55] <arthurvr> could be that too
[03:27:28] <samu> or maybe a more of a conspiracy theory.
[03:27:50] <samu> some evil hacker must have taken control over my keyboard and changed <script> to <sctipt>
[03:27:54] <samu> that's the only explanation! :)
[03:28:06] <arthurvr> haha
[03:28:07] <samu> sorry guys, after trying to reproduce the problem on a smaller scale I found that typo
[03:28:25] <arthurvr> np ;-)
[03:29:07] <arthurvr> don’t your editor complains about that kinds of stuff?
[03:29:51] <samu> it's actually weird that it didn't
[03:29:52] <samu> :D
[03:31:41] <samu> perhaps I accidentally changed something in settings that pycharm didn't have a problem with a nonexistent tag
[03:32:08] <arthurvr>  IMO you shouldn’t write tags yourself
[04:01:21] <johnline> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/data/greetings/
[04:01:42] <johnline> this on mobile chrome .fadeIn's my html5 video to black
[04:01:48] <johnline> cant work out why
[04:11:16] <Chulbul> I'm getting this TypeError: this.points[1] is undefined, but this.points[1].series.name is returning "Views" as its value ..
[04:13:40] <arthurvr> chulbul: can you give us a testcase? Jsfiddle or so?
[04:15:35] <Chulbul> yeah, is it fine if I provide you pastebin url, my code?
[04:15:56] <arthurvr> yeah, but jsfiddle is always more handy
[04:16:01] <arthurvr> or jsbin
[04:16:03] <arthurvr> codepen
[04:16:21] <Uhkis> !demo
[04:16:21] <b-ot> Uhkis: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:16:22] <Chulbul> ok give me few minutes please
[04:23:32] <Chulbul> http://jsfiddle.net/bavweLwk/
[04:24:06] <arthurvr> where did you saw that error?
[04:24:50] <Chulbul> this is working fine on jsfiddle without any error, but on my system its showing error on firebug console
[04:25:12] <arthurvr> than it is because the error isn’t in that module or piece of code
[04:25:22] <Chulbul> although its creating graph properly ..
[04:25:34] <arthurvr> that’s what I mean
[04:25:41] <arthurvr> this isn’t the piece of code that fails
[04:26:29] <Chulbul> It might be some jquery conflict, whats the way to resolve it.
[04:26:52] <arthurvr> what do you mean with conflict? $ already been defined? Or different versions loaded in? ?
[04:27:23] <arthurvr> check if you’re using same version of jquery in jsfiddle than locally
[04:28:38] <Chulbul> http://jsfiddle.net/bavweLwk/1/ I tried with 1.11 also
[04:28:53] <arthurvr> well than it’s something else failing
[04:29:07] <arthurvr> bump into devtools and check where stuff is failing
[04:29:48] <Chulbul> I have never used that, could you please tell me how to use devtools.
[04:30:07] <arthurvr> w00t? that’s quite an essensial tool these days!
[04:30:11] <arthurvr> what browser are you using?
[04:30:28] <Chulbul> firefox
[04:30:50] <arthurvr> go to the page that is failing
[04:31:03] <arthurvr> right click > inspect element
[04:31:18] <arthurvr> go to the console
[04:31:24] <arthurvr> (in the tabs on the top)
[04:31:35] <arthurvr> there?
[04:33:05] <Chulbul> wow, its crazy. I went to that page using console/script and than select that line number and clicked on play button, then refreshed page and there is no more error :o
[04:39:10] <Chulbul> I got disconnected, did you reply anything Arthur
[04:39:52] <Chulbul> http://jsfiddle.net/bavweLwk/1/ could you just tell me, how to make tooltip visible after disabling clicks, tooltip isn't visible at all
[04:45:51] <bl4ckdu5t> Usually I handle notification message displays from ajax calls by showing them for some seconds and fade out
[04:46:20] <bl4ckdu5t> Now the case is different. I am not using ajax
[04:46:49] <bl4ckdu5t> I have something like a p.notifier:empty{display: none;}
[04:47:28] <bl4ckdu5t> when a notice is available it displays in my <p class="notifier"></p> and it gets visible
[04:48:07] <bl4ckdu5t> Now is there a way to check when it changes from display: none and set it back to display: none after some mins
[04:48:11] <bl4ckdu5t> *seconds

[05:09:37] <bl4ckdu5t> ok good
[05:10:03] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm still working it on one because I'm kinda idle. I'll just turn it into something more interesting :D

[05:10:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm so sleepy..
[05:11:18] <Francis> hey will you plz help me
[05:11:39] <Francis> how can i bind the events with droopable elments
[05:14:09] <MikeD_> Francis: I can't see how that's even supposed to work
[05:14:40] <Francis> sorry what you want to say
[05:15:25] <Francis> make it clear
[05:15:28] <MikeD_> i haven't yet had enough coffee to figure it out... i suggest putting more comments in your code
[05:15:54] <MikeD_> that might help you make sense of it in an effort to explain it to me
[05:16:34] <MikeD_> tbh, that might be the reason the code i'm writing doesn't work... *I* don't know what it's doing
[05:17:26] <Francis> Mike-D  i want to make flow model and anything
[05:19:03] <MikeD_> i don't know what that means... i just meant a /* block comment */ before each major section of code that explains what you expect it to do
[05:19:59] <Francis> forgot the block comment sir
[05:20:17] <Francis> see the functionality of fiddle
[05:20:21] <Francis> MikeD_
[05:21:05] <MikeD_> oh, now I see it... i didn't know it was even that much workable becuase I was trying to drag the arrow-button
[05:21:47] <Francis> oooh no drag the menu podcast and music
[05:22:11] <Francis> once you drop on drop place one more time you drop one same one
[05:22:32] <MikeD_> ok, i guess it works
[05:22:49] <Francis> yeah it's works
[05:22:51] <MikeD_> i mean, i kinda hate drag&drop in general, but i guess that's my problem eh?
[05:23:07] <Francis> then you help me plz
[05:23:24] <MikeD_> well, what IS the problem?
[05:25:57] <Francis> MikeD_   when you drop the element like (music)   ,  one more time you can drop the (menu or anything) into it  i want that each time i drop it goona be droppable
[05:26:29] <Francis> drop into drop into drop into drop
[05:26:40] <MikeD_> stop saying "drop"
[05:26:46] <Francis> ok
[05:27:52] <MikeD_> are you trying to make more than 2 levels of nesting?
[05:28:01] <Francis> yes
[05:28:40] <kubanc> Hello, any idea why this code is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/sj2o52g8/33/
[05:30:23] <MikeD_> kubanc: what would working look like?
[05:30:57] <kubanc> well the code that i have putten into jquers is not coloring every second child of th
[05:31:06] <MikeD_> Francis: did you write that code or copy it from somewhere?
[05:31:19] <Francis> MIkeD_  man this is mine
[05:31:25] <Francis> wait
[05:31:52] <Francis> https://unsee.cc/meporuba/
[05:31:58] <Francis> that's a design
[05:32:08] <MikeD_> kubanc: why would you expect it to act on th when you specify td ?
[05:33:06] <MikeD_> Francis: that's a design?  that's 3 rectangles and 2 arrows
[05:33:12] <Francis> MikeD_ now you help
[05:33:26] <Francis> yes
[05:33:27] <kubanc> sorry, i specified that every second child of th should be colored. I have managed to do it in CSS code, but i cannot do it in JQuery...
[05:33:57] <Francis> i know not so cool actually i am working on it
[05:34:26] <Francis> MikeD_ some css problem
[05:35:53] <Francis> MIikeD_  now wil  you
[05:38:25] <Francis> help
[05:38:27] <MikeD_> i still don't really understand what you are trying to do
[05:40:11] <Francis> what you want to know tell me
[05:41:10] <Francis> plz
[05:41:29] <MikeD_> kubanc: http://jsfiddle.net/sj2o52g8/35/
[05:44:03] <MikeD_> Francis: so how do you know which of the LI you are inserting?
[05:44:35] <Francis> MikeD_ inspect elemnt
[05:45:58] <Francis> MikeD_ ijust need a good logic to make it
[05:48:00] <MikeD_> fyi - ol#external-event has several li with id="list"
[05:48:18] <MikeD_> that's not affecting this fiddle, but it is wrong.
[05:48:48] <Francis> yes i know in original one the id is different one
[05:48:53] <sine0> is jquery loaded inside <body> with <script> so that its in the body. why not in the header ?
[05:49:05] <sine0> im new and starting to use some scripts on my webpage
[05:50:39] <Francis> Hey MikeD_ plz now  will you help
[05:51:14] <MikeD_> i am trying to help
[05:51:40] <Francis> ok or i explain my question one more time
[05:51:41] <MikeD_> i am not already an expert at draggable() and droppable() ui functionality
[05:51:58] <MikeD_> i have a difficult time reading your code
[05:52:21] <MikeD_> because variables are named index and subindex but there is nothing explaining what you are thinking
[05:52:32] <MikeD_> so i have to try to imagine the solution
[05:52:38] <MikeD_> that takes more time than you want to wait.
[05:53:15] <MikeD_> it kinda looks like it's working as intended
[05:53:23] <MikeD_> so i'm not sure there's something to 'fix'
[05:54:01] <MikeD_> like kubanc's fiddle was just using the wrong event, i changed it to document ready and his code worked perfectly
[05:54:25] <Francis> ok
[05:54:27] <kubanc> oh, thank you for that MikeD_  :D
[05:54:45] <Distraught> Is there any way to stop a function from working (which has some settimeouts and loops itslef) by clicking a button?
[05:55:06] <Francis> but MikeD_ in my fiddle i done everything there is no problem
[05:55:21] <Francis> just add a small functionality
[05:55:32] <MikeD_> oh, so what are we looking for?
[05:56:49] <Francis> binding a drop elemnt to droppable one
[05:56:53] <Francis> and nothing
[05:56:57] <MikeD_> Distraught: if you build the function to care about the state of that button, or are you trying to inject functionality without updating the target function?
[05:57:29] <Distraught> i want though another function to stop this function from working
[06:01:02] <pdcmoreira> hey guys, i need a lightweight bootstrap-looking gantt chart (just for showing, not editable). is there such a thing?
[06:02:35] <cjohnson> Distraught: in function foo, if (someState.someBoolean) and only run the code if it's true
[06:02:45] <cjohnson> then in the onclick handler for your button, change someState.someBoolean
[06:04:20] <Francis> hey MikeD_ got something that i need i know it hard to that
[06:04:27] <Francis> but i need some help
[06:04:34] <Distraught> thank you :D
[06:06:42] <cjohnson> sine0: putting scripts above </body> in your HTML defers loading them until after the page has been mostly loaded, which guarantees that the code won't run until the DOM is mostly ready (I say mostly because it won't have gotten the closing body and html tags yet, but good enough to start looking for nodes)
[06:07:20] <cjohnson> sine0: so if I have $('#something').hide() in my JS and I put that in <head>, it will run immediately, and the element hasn't been loaded yet. so if I move that code below the body, I can be sure the element has loaded
[06:08:09] <cjohnson> sine0: you can get around that by using DOMContentLoaded aka jquery's $(document).ready(function(){ ... }) aka $(function(){ ... })
[06:30:52] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[06:37:28] <arthurvr> silent here today
[06:38:31] <cjohnson> not really, just haven't had any questions in the last half hour :P
[06:58:12] <Kartagis> or an hour
[07:04:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah... quiet... a little too quiet.

[07:18:39] <bl4ckdu5t> I have something like a p.notifier:empty{display: none;} in my css
[07:19:00] <bl4ckdu5t> my server-side code puts notifications into it and it gets displayed
[07:19:36] <bl4ckdu5t> Is there a way to check when the elements changes state from display: none ?
[07:20:20] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm trying to set it back to display: none after some seconds of displaying the notice. I'm not using ajax for the form submission else it would have been easier
[07:36:08] <bl4ckdu5t> I think I figured it out
[07:42:45] <jmdrawne_> Hello, any idea after my jquery uses .submit(); the button no longer works?
[07:43:11] <jmdrawne_> I've create a back/forward button for a select box
[07:44:00] <jmdrawne_> Which submits after changing the value. This is works fine but then the next page it doesnt seem to call the js on clicking the divs
[07:46:44] <jmdrawne_> It's a ajax call so im guessing jQuery(document).ready(function () { isnt being called
[07:52:05] <bl4ckdu5t> jmdrawne_: paste what you are doing on a paste site
[07:52:30] <varchar> have you also checked the console to check for any errors.
[07:52:54] <jmdrawne_> bl4ckdu5t: http://pastebin.com/ByWs7D8c
[07:52:58] <jmdrawne_> No errors
[07:53:08] <jmdrawne_> Used break points and it just doesnt get called the second time
[07:56:04] <bl4ckdu5t> why do you have to write it twice?
[07:57:54] <jmdrawne_> Probably a far better way of writing it admittedly but its just one for increasing the val and one for decreasing
[07:58:53] <bl4ckdu5t> you said there were no errors but there is http://jsbin.com/jaxamaziji/1/edit
[08:00:07] <jmdrawne_> odd firebug didn't pick up on that
[08:01:39] <bl4ckdu5t> your selectors are too long as well. I just edited the code to give no error
[08:01:55] <bl4ckdu5t> see again http://jsbin.com/jaxamaziji/1/edit
[08:03:05] <jmdrawne_> Drupal uses 2 versions of jQuery which is why I have to used jQuery everywhere + hence the crazy selectors
[08:03:51] <bl4ckdu5t> this one especiall views-exposed-form-what-s-on-all-list-view-page-1
[08:03:57] <bl4ckdu5t> #views-exposed-form-what-s-on-all-list-view-page-1
[08:04:35] <bl4ckdu5t> ok you may change the $ back to jQuery but it should be fine this way
[08:04:46] <jmdrawne_> Yup that's what Drupal churns out sadly
[08:05:02] <bl4ckdu5t> for the other part, you shouldn't have to write another $(document).ready() statement
[08:05:25] <bl4ckdu5t> it can live in the same block where this is
[08:05:26] <jmdrawne_> You've removed back?
[08:05:33] <bl4ckdu5t> yes I did
[08:05:37] <bl4ckdu5t> I'll add it up now
[08:05:51] <bl4ckdu5t> I thought it was just a repetition
[08:06:10] <jmdrawne_> ah I did wonder
[08:06:17] <jmdrawne_> So you've added a ;?
[08:06:41] <bl4ckdu5t> yes
[08:07:22] <jmdrawne_> okdoky
[08:07:52] <jmdrawne_> And I've grouped them both in one doc ready
[08:07:58] <bl4ckdu5t> yea this way http://jsbin.com/jaxamaziji/1/edit
[08:08:27] <jmdrawne_> ah I always forget about comments in js
[08:08:46] <bl4ckdu5t> even better this way now http://jsbin.com/jaxamaziji/1/edit
[08:08:51] <jmdrawne_> still dies after submit and the ajax changes the content
[08:08:53] <jmdrawne_> hmm
[08:08:57] <bl4ckdu5t> I moved the .submit() part to the bottom only
[08:09:29] <bl4ckdu5t> and yes I didn't expect anything to happen on your submit because you don't just write submit
[08:09:42] <bl4ckdu5t> submit is like a signal, it needs a slot
[08:10:05] <bl4ckdu5t> .submit(function(){ // do this })
[08:10:10] <bl4ckdu5t> ;
[08:10:57] <bl4ckdu5t> Like here http://jsbin.com/jaxamaziji/1/edit
[08:13:40] <jmdrawne_> It does work though
[08:14:02] <jmdrawne_> Its just after the page reloads it breaks
[08:14:34] <jmdrawne_> well clicking the divs doesnt seem fire the clicks
[08:15:10] <jmdrawne_> Drupal detects the submit on the form
[08:15:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I didn't see what your HTML is like so I'm really not sure of how it works for you. I just helped refactor
[08:18:37] <jmdrawne_> Apparently $(document).ready( doesnt work with dynamic content
[08:19:12] <jmdrawne_> Should be using $(document).on('click', ?
[08:23:56] <bl4ckdu5t> If you will use $(document).on('click',.. it should be within $(document).ready()
[08:25:48] <jmdrawne_> Ok thanks
[08:54:51] <phelix> I getting a selector from the html. But when the data is loaded through ajax it seems it doesn't find the selector. anyone know how I can go about correcting this.
[08:57:22] <MikeD_> does .closest() work up a document fragment before it's added to the DOM ?
[08:57:56] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: What do ou mean work up?
[09:00:18] <MikeD_> var myUL = $('<ul>'); var myLI = $('<li>').appendTo( myUL );  var myLIParent = myLI.closest('ul');    myLIParent =?= myUL; ?
[09:00:46] <MikeD_> (myUL has not been added to DOM)
[09:01:33] <BillCriswell> Two jQuery objects will never be the same, but I'm not positive about the node itself... I'll try it out.
[09:03:32] <phelix> I thought adding something like $('#block-system-main', context).on('click', 'button.get_links', function() { where #block-system-main is the parent container where everything is located inside would allow this to work. seems not to be working though =/
[09:04:07] <BillCriswell> I've been having the weirdest issues with Chrome lately.
[09:04:24] <arthurvr> what kinds?
[09:04:32] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/p3Lq2yL3/ this you mean?
[09:04:44] <cjohnson> MikeD_: jquery works on fragments, I imagine it would work
[09:04:49] <cjohnson> it would return myUL right
[09:05:34] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Scrolling down is sometimes seen as me trying to go back. console messages won't show unless I toggle between panels, sometimes the dev tools just won't show up unless I close a tab and reopen.
[09:05:43] <MikeD_> i guess i should have tested that myself... my real app is failing miserably and I don't understand why
[09:06:01] <arthurvr> weird, what channel are you using?
[09:06:11] <arthurvr> btw, this isn't jquery related, let's move over to private
[09:06:39] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Ok.
[09:07:11] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: Actually, I'll be headed out soon but I can reconnect later.
[09:07:23] <arthurvr> perfect. ping me later
[09:07:34] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[09:08:09] <spudzee> how do I get Math.sin() to take the sin of the angle in degrees instead of radians?
[09:08:27] <cjohnson> \m/ sin \m/
[09:08:35] <arthurvr> easyfix: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9705123/how-can-i-get-sin-cos-and-tan-to-use-degrees-instead-of-radians
[09:08:52] <arthurvr> or wasn't that what you mean?
[09:09:34] <spudzee> I guess I could just convert my angle to radians before it takes the sin of it
[09:09:45] <spudzee> okay, I'll do that
[09:10:59] <spudzee> I swear this chat is more of rubber ducky debugging than it is actually me getting help
[09:12:17] <MikeD_> you say that like it's a bad thing
[09:12:31] <spudzee> is it a bad thing?
[09:17:50] <spudzee> how to delay an animation within a for loop...
[09:18:46] <spudzee> setTimeout(function(){ animation }, 500); that doesn't work, it says,"don't make a function within a for loop"
[09:19:37] <spudzee> I don't think I rubber ducky my way out of this one
[09:21:36] <spudzee> okay, I have my question... How do I make the for loop wait a second before looping again?
[09:21:52] <cjohnson> don't use a for loop
[09:21:57] <spudzee> what do I use?
[09:22:04] <cjohnson> make a function, at the end of the function, setTimeout(thatFunc, 1000)
[09:22:12] <cjohnson> break when you reach the last run
[09:22:20] <spudzee> k
[09:22:22] <cjohnson> woops I mean return, not break
[09:22:31] <spudzee> kk
[09:23:26] <jbudz> or use the delay method
[09:23:53] <spudzee> I could never bother getting .delay to work
[09:24:06] <spudzee> just let me use my old man setTimeout

[09:52:57] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/7p8vajub/
[09:53:29] <MikeD_> i'd like some help learning to write in a style that isn't so procedurally blocking
[09:53:54] <MikeD_> is my first step to download and use a promise library?
[09:56:35] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: jQuery has promises.
[09:57:07] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://api.jquery.com/promise/ might be useful in accomplishing that.
[09:57:14] <BillCriswell> and to be honest I can definitely use a brush up on that topic.
[09:57:43] <Uhkis> so you promise to clean..? :D
[09:59:57] <MikeD_> that promise never settles
[10:00:25] <MikeD_> it returns a Lie instead
[10:00:38] <cjohnson> MikeD_: what are you doing in myfn that would take so long?
[10:00:56] <cjohnson> a single synchronous block of code is rarely so heavy
[10:01:31] <cjohnson> most slow things are done asynchronously
[10:01:31] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/ has some helpful examples
[10:01:37] <MikeD_> it's a trivialized example... it's actually a lot more $.each() and other craziness
[10:01:54] <cjohnson> sure, but even still
[10:02:07] <cjohnson> you'd have to be an utterly insane amount of things in one block to take longer than 4ms
[10:02:24] <MikeD_> yeah, well that's why I'm trying to learn how to best break calls into smaller pieces
[10:02:38] <cjohnson> setTimeout(chunk, 0)
[10:03:06] <cjohnson> MikeD_: check this article out http://javascript.info/tutorial/events-and-timing-depth
[10:05:02] <cjohnson> http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/ also good
[10:05:15] <cjohnson> helps explain how the JS loop works
[10:05:42] <MikeD_> so in order to know the parent scope, i need to create a closure and pass that to setTimeout ?
[10:07:01] <cjohnson> depends. if you do setTimeout(chunk, 0) you'd have to find some way to explicitly pass the scope into chunk
[10:07:15] <cjohnson> since the scope comes from where the function is defined, not where it is run
[10:07:41] <cjohnson> but var foo = 5; setTimeout(function() { foo; }, 0)
[10:07:51] <cjohnson> if you define it inline, the scope is inherited
[10:08:23] <MikeD_> what if that var is inside an iterator like $.each() ?
[10:08:32] <cjohnson> still, in 99% of cases you won't be doing enough synchronous operations to have a need to break things into chunks to be spread over multiple JS ticks
[10:09:10] <cjohnson> MikeD_: $.each is irrelevant. the scope is dictated only by function() {}
[10:09:26] <cjohnson> $.each(function() { ... }) so in this case, yes
[10:10:05] <BillCriswell> I just assumed there would be async shit happening in the loop.
[10:11:20] <cjohnson> well then the loop would execute instantly since the async stuff doesn't call back until later
[10:11:31] <BillCriswell> Right.
[10:12:38] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[10:12:40] <MikeD_> var foo = $('#foo'); $.each( [1,2,3,...,n], function( idx, el ){   setTimeout( function(){ $('<p>' + el + '</p>').appendTo( foo ); }, 0 ) );
[10:15:15] <cjohnson> in this case, foo is defined outside the function, so the scope of that var would be shared
[10:15:19] <cjohnson> which it seems like is your intention
[10:15:35] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/5fovk56a/1/
[10:15:37] <cjohnson> if you define a var inside the function(idx, el) that's a scope that only the individual callbacks would have, not shared
[10:15:38] <MikeD_> yeah
[10:15:58] <cjohnson> sl el for example is not shared
[10:16:03] <cjohnson> so el*
[10:16:37] <MikeD_> i expected a lot more pain to do that
[10:17:27] <cjohnson> each tick is scheduled in order that you schedule it with your setTimeout calls
[10:17:50] <cjohnson> so basically the way your code breaks down is
[10:19:10] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/hm1dw0vg/
[10:19:28] <cjohnson> with each tick having its own individual scope
[10:20:01] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/5fovk56a/2/  i get the event schedule and ticks, i didn't realize I wasn't going to have to manage scope more explicitly
[10:20:47] <cjohnson> you can use Promise.all to schedule an event to run after each of these events resolves
[10:21:22] <cjohnson> if you wrap the events in promises
[10:21:30] <MikeD_> I'll come back when I run into that requirement
[10:21:50] <MikeD_> for the moment I'm happy to just come up for air while the dom is rendered
[10:22:30] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: I just came up with this to help me understand a little better... might be useful to you: http://jsbin.com/wawucukaya/2/edit?js,output
[10:22:33] <cjohnson> also the way you're doing it is parallel
[10:22:40] <cjohnson> you could also do it serially
[10:22:51] <cjohnson> by calling the next setTimeout from the completion of the current one
[10:32:02] <MikeD_> putting that setTimeout around a few calls took about 5 minutes to do, but makes a huge difference in the 'feel' of the app start
[10:33:04] <cjohnson> it removes the chokehold on the CPU that sync operations are putting on it
[10:33:10] <cjohnson> gives the UI thread a chance to do things
[10:33:27] <cjohnson> those articles I linked are really handy
[10:33:47] <MikeD_> yeah, people are generally ok to wait 5 seconds if they see something happening... but 5 seconds of dead-spinny... not good.

[11:24:49] <rogue780> I have an input like this: <input name='ship_to[address]' /> What selector can I use for it? I tried input[name=ship_to[address]] but that doesn't seem to work
[11:26:54] <rogue780> nevermind
[11:29:15] <cjohnson> name="ship_to[address]"
[12:55:06] <OnceMe> Hello, how can I call ajax only once, I have 10 divs, and each div calls ajax and calls link for each div, however I don't want to call on hover div 1, if div 1 is already called before, so I reduce ajax calls and speed up web page
[12:55:33] <cjohnson> paste code OnceMe
[12:55:37] <OnceMe> so if I hover over div(1) I call ajax, and its loaded then I hover out and link is still there, appended,
[12:55:38] <cjohnson> divs don't call ajax
[12:55:40] <OnceMe> but hidden
[12:55:42] <OnceMe> Yes OK
[12:55:49] <OnceMe> is pastebin k?
[12:55:52] <OnceMe> I cant make jsfiddle
[12:55:56] <cjohnson> the quick answer is: check for the content before running ajax request
[12:56:12] <cjohnson> on hover, show tooltip. on show, if content is empty, load via ajax
[12:56:32] <cjohnson> then when you re-hover, you show tooltip again, and content isn't empty, so the ajax call is bypassed
[12:56:59] <OnceMe> also I have an issue when I hover out and hover inside profile box
[12:57:02] <OnceMe> which shows profile's info
[12:57:45] <cjohnson> need more details
[12:57:52] <cjohnson> these questions are incredibly vague
[12:58:45] <OnceMe> here http://pastebin.com/ziTYap7k
[12:59:36] <cjohnson> what is the issue
[12:59:45] <OnceMe> as you can see, other issue is, when I hover out from profile box, box remain for 400s and than disappears, which is fine, its just hidden not removed, however if I hover out from username link and hover in profile_box, box will still disappear
[12:59:50] <OnceMe> since  it's outside of main profile div
[13:00:00] <OnceMe> so how can I make it to remain when its inside?
[13:00:21] <cjohnson> put the mouseover /mouseleave on the whole thing?
[13:01:04] <cjohnson> oh I see what you mean. You mouse over link, it shows tooltip
[13:01:06] <OnceMe> no its not an option
[13:01:08] <cjohnson> when you mouse over the tooltip, it hides
[13:01:11] <OnceMe> well actually its like a fb thing
[13:01:19] <OnceMe> when you hover on profile pic/thumbnail you get a profile box
[13:01:30] <OnceMe> with cover pic etc and when you hover inside profile box, it will remain
[13:01:34] <OnceMe> I hope this makes it more clear
[13:02:08] <rogue780> Is this channel logged?
[13:02:21] <cjohnson> OnceMe: what about:  link onmouseenter, show the profile. profile onmouseleave, hide the profile
[13:02:27] <cjohnson> don't do anything on link onmouseout
[13:02:41] <cjohnson> rogue780: some of us log it I'm sure. do you need something specific?
[13:03:19] <cjohnson> OnceMe: or link onmouseout, set timer to hide in 50ms. profile onmouseenter, clear the timer
[13:03:47] <OnceMe> I don't get it
[13:03:53] <cjohnson> which part
[13:03:57] <OnceMe> none of it
[13:04:03] <OnceMe> if I dont do anything onmouseleave
[13:04:12] <OnceMe> then profile box will remain there forever
[13:04:12] <rogue780> cjohnson: yes, but I just realized I need #bootstrap's logs not #jquery's
[13:04:29] <cjohnson> clearly it's not "none of it". clearly you understand some of it
[13:04:33] <OnceMe> and when I hover on other profile, it willl be two profile box
[13:04:46] <cjohnson> I said don't do anything on *link* mouseleave
[13:04:49] <cjohnson> hide profile on *profile* mouseleave
[13:05:41] <OnceMe> its not a link
[13:05:46] <OnceMe> it's a thumbnail and thats not an option
[13:05:54] <OnceMe> what if I never get inside profile box
[13:06:03] <OnceMe> it will remain there forever too
[13:06:12] <cjohnson> 16:03 < cjohnson> OnceMe: or link onmouseout, set timer to hide in 50ms. profile onmouseenter, clear the timer
[13:06:25] <cjohnson> that covers that situation
[13:06:37] <cjohnson> it doesn't matter if it's a link or a thumbnail, it still generates a mouseenter event
[13:07:40] <cjohnson> here's some psuedocode OnceMe http://jsfiddle.net/gc0ygmow/
[13:07:54] <cjohnson> you'll have to set up a timer for each profile/thumbnail combo
[13:08:08] <OnceMe> no
[13:08:10] <OnceMe> I need to use delegate
[13:08:24] <cjohnson> then use delegate.
[13:08:48] <cjohnson> but you should upgrade your jquery. delegate is deprecated
[13:09:20] <cjohnson> and on does the same thing delegate used to do
[13:09:41] <cjohnson> like I said, this is psuedo code. Just use the *concepts* for your own code
[13:16:03] <OnceMe> hmm let me try then
[13:16:09] <OnceMe> Ill keep you updated
[13:16:10] <OnceMe> MAAAN
[13:16:29] <OnceMe> and oh yeah from my code cjohnson how to call ajax only once
[13:16:52] <OnceMe> as you can see I call event on hover inside callprofile_box
[13:17:00] <OnceMe> so I have like 10 callprofile_box each for separate profile
[13:17:10] <OnceMe> I thought about var ajax = false; but then it would work only for one hover
[13:18:14] <cjohnson> like I said, the solution to that is only call the ajax if the content hasn't already loaded
[13:18:48] <cjohnson> so for: <div id="remote-content"></div>  $.ajax({... $('#remote-content').html(responseText); ... })
[13:19:05] <cjohnson> do if (!$('#remote-content').html()) { $.ajax .....
[13:22:17] <cjohnson> ideally you can check for the existence of a specific element instead of just checking if html() is not empty...
[13:34:12] <OnceMe> there must be other way
[13:34:16] <OnceMe> like with $.each or something
[13:34:37] <cjohnson> What's wrong with that solution?
[13:38:15] <OnceMe> I need a simpler one
[13:39:54] <cjohnson> there's nothing complicated about it
[13:39:58] <cjohnson> good luck

[14:07:25] <wa5ted> AcidRain2012: fix the alignment
[14:07:39] <wa5ted> or make the nicks bold
[14:07:59] <wa5ted> AcidRain2012: also it doesnt scroll when you send a message
[14:08:11] <AcidRain2012> wa5ted yea ill make them bold by default. but when im done with the functionality, im going to make it all customizable
[14:08:18] <AcidRain2012> i have stylesheet set to php type :)
[14:08:26] <AcidRain2012> what browser do you use?
[14:08:32] <wa5ted> chrome 39
[14:08:35] <wa5ted> mac
[14:09:23] <AcidRain2012> hmmm
[14:09:37] <wa5ted> scroll whe you type a message deosnt work
[14:10:05] <AcidRain2012> it should only automatically scroll down when you are less than 200 pixels from the bottom of the max scroll
[14:11:47] <AcidRain2012> hmmm, should work now actually
[14:12:22] <AcidRain2012> refresh page, and type something
[14:12:26] <AcidRain2012> let me see if it auto scrolls for me
[14:12:36] <AcidRain2012> or actually, just type anything
[14:12:36] <AcidRain2012> lol
[15:12:38] <OnceMe> hmm
[15:12:49] <OnceMe> cjohnson:your pseudo code kinda works
[15:13:07] <OnceMe> however when I hoverout from thumbnail, profile box is instantly hidden
[15:13:10] <OnceMe> dunno why
[15:13:24] <OnceMe> its like it skips mouseenter step, and goes straight to mouseout
[15:15:59] <systemfault> What are the events you use?
[15:16:39] <OnceMe> on on profile_box div
[15:16:41] <OnceMe> mouseenter
[15:16:47] <OnceMe> and mouseleave
[15:17:04] <OnceMe> I just checked in console, and it seems like it enters, then leaves, then enters again
[15:17:11] <OnceMe> and then when I hover out it leaves fine
[15:17:15] <OnceMe> dont know why it doubles it
[15:18:09] <OnceMe> heh nevermind
[15:18:18] <OnceMe> it was because parent div was closing before child div
[15:18:20] <OnceMe> it works now
[15:18:29] <systemfault> :D
[15:18:54] <OnceMe> now I need to figure out how to call ajax only once for a div block
[15:18:56] <OnceMe> to reduce db calls
[15:19:52] <OnceMe> also do you maybe know how to wait until imgs loads completelly systemfault
[15:20:07] <OnceMe> I call ajax and append(html) to the div, however img appears to load after I appended it
[15:20:13] <OnceMe> I want to append it only when image is fully loaded
[15:20:22] <OnceMe> I append it on success: ..append(html);
[15:21:59] <systemfault> OnceMe: It's a bit complicated to do it reliably
[15:22:09] <OnceMe> hmm ok I wont complicate then
[15:22:16] <OnceMe> I just love how tumblr shows it with animation inside
[15:22:23] <OnceMe> but i guess I have time to implement it later on
[15:22:28] <OnceMe> now how to make only one ajax call
[15:22:29] <systemfault> But you'd have to create a out of DOM fragment with the HTML: var frag = $(html);
[15:22:34] <systemfault> Then hide all images in it
[15:23:29] <systemfault> Then you need to select all the images in it, check if they're already loaded, if that's the case show it... if not, you need to attach a "load" event that would display it once it's done loading..
[15:36:18] <OnceMe> ok
[15:36:20] <OnceMe> how to call ajax once
[15:36:25] <OnceMe> thats more emeregcncy muy nk
[15:37:32] <cjohnson> explained this to you several times
[15:38:11] <OnceMe> ok cjohnson
[15:38:13] <OnceMe> one more question
[15:38:22] <OnceMe> when I hoverout and hoverin fast to the thumbnail
[15:38:28] <OnceMe> like really fast with a mouse multiple times
[15:38:32] <OnceMe> and when I remain hoveredin
[15:38:40] <OnceMe> nothing is pulling in, nothing is showing up in profile box
[15:38:48] <OnceMe> it must be because delay between hovers is not 400+
[15:38:50] <OnceMe> 400ms+
[15:39:06] <OnceMe> I lowered it to 100ms and works fine, but now if I hoverout of thumbnail for 100ms
[15:39:11] <OnceMe> it disappear profile box
[15:39:18] <OnceMe> thats really fast is there a way around
[15:39:18] <cjohnson> try lowering further
[15:39:27] <OnceMe> ?
[15:41:18] <OnceMe> cjohnson:
[18:32:53] <maddtech> Can anyone help me write some jquery to add an active class to a li when it's clicked?
[19:28:12] <fold> maddtech: something like $("li").click(function(){ $(this).addClass("active"); })
[22:15:18] <Ayub> can some one help me with cross domain ajax file upload ?
[22:16:10] <Ayub> I have issue interpreting the response object returned from server. I used ajaxForm plugin however the response is lost and is not available in the call back methods
