[06:03:49] <snfgf> hi
[06:04:29] <snfgf> is there a jquery function to scroll (or jump) to a particular <div id="...>?
[06:06:03] <Cork> snfgf: $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: .$('#id').position().top }, 300)
[06:06:21] <Cork> there is a plugin that lets you do this cleaner if you like

[06:11:10] <ThierryAhn> i'm having a issue with the next button of my datepicker
[06:11:30] <ThierryAhn> it's like it reloading my datepicker
[06:12:01] <ThierryAhn> this happen when i use datepicker show method
[06:13:36] <ThierryAhn> if somebody can help

[06:27:53] <Folabi> hi guys
[06:28:25] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to wrap tags around a string with 'wrap()'. But I'm getting an error. This is the function: https://hastebin.com/sutumacovu.js
[06:28:40] <bobdobbs> The error is "TypeError: electorate.wrap is not a function"
[06:29:22] <bobdobbs> I'm checking the type, cos the docs for wrap() tells me that wrap works on some kinds of structure, including tstrings
[06:29:43] <bobdobbs> When I run that 'typeof' it confirms that the structure is a string
[06:29:49] <bobdobbs> what am I doing wrong?
[06:30:00] <bobdobbs> oh yeah... I'm using jquery 3
[06:30:05] <bobdobbs> (if that makes a difference)
[06:33:31] <Folabi> i'm using two datepickers in my project. The first one open the second calendar with show method. I notice the next button on the second calendar close and reopen the calendar.  I want to avoid this "open/reopen" issue. You can check this here : http://jsfiddle.net/8w8v9/3078/
[06:33:53] <Folabi> what am i missing ?
[06:37:35] <Woet> bobdobbs: www.jsfiddle.net - working test case please
[06:42:27] <bobdobbs> Woet: I'll try and put something on plnkr
[06:49:07] <bobdobbs> Woet: sorry for taking a while. I'm still trying to figure out how to get my own js working on plnkr
[06:49:26] <Woet> bobdobbs: i did link jsfiddle, not plnkr.
[06:49:48] <bobdobbs> oh, sorry
[06:54:09] <bobdobbs> Woet: https://jsfiddle.net/zfg0qazh/
[06:55:26] <Woet> bobdobbs: so what is "this.Electorate" supposed to be and where is the wrap function defined?
[06:56:16] <Woet> bobdobbs: you know jquery functions rely on $ right?
[06:56:33] <Woet> bobdobbs: http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[06:57:03] <bobdobbs> 'this.electorate' is supposed to be the string indexed by 'electorate' in the object passed to the each
[06:57:37] <bobdobbs> afaik, the wrap function is defined in jQuery?
[06:57:44] <Woet> bobdobbs: yes, but then use $
[06:57:48] <Woet> bobdobbs: look at the examples on that page
[06:57:53] <bobdobbs> k...
[06:59:06] <Woet> bobdobbs: also note that its meant for wrapping HTML structures, not simple strings
[06:59:20] <Woet> bobdobbs: because for strings you could just concatenate like usual with javascript
[06:59:56] <bobdobbs> I figured wrap() would make the code more readable. and I think the doc says that you can wrap() strings
[07:00:31] <Woet> bobdobbs: it says you can wrap HTML strings, its different.
[07:00:36] <bobdobbs> oh
[07:03:36] <bobdobbs> ok, I'm now trying to just concatenate: https://jsfiddle.net/zfg0qazh/1/
[07:04:05] <Woet> bobdobbs: why are you converting the string into a jquery object..?
[07:04:26] <bobdobbs> oh that's right. I don't need to do that anymore!
[07:04:29] <bobdobbs> wups
[07:06:02] <bobdobbs> aw man. making noob slips. I prolly need sleep
[07:06:06] <bobdobbs> thanks Woet :)
[08:03:01] <Folabi> hi do somebody can help on jquery datepicker ?
[08:24:27] <Folabi> hi
[08:24:37] <Folabi> i'm using two datepickers in my project.
[08:24:53] <Folabi>  The first one open the second calendar with show method
[08:24:58] <Folabi> I notice the next button on the second calendar close and reopen the calendar
[08:25:05] <Folabi> I want to avoid this "open/reopen" issue
[08:25:15] <Folabi> what am i doing wrong
[08:25:16] <Folabi> ?
[08:25:17] <Folabi> You can check this here : http://jsfiddle.net/8w8v9/3078/
[08:35:11] <shoky> Folabi: i'm not sure why that happens, but a workaround with setTimeout seems to fix it:  http://jsfiddle.net/8w8v9/3079/
[08:36:26] <Folabi> thanks shoky
[08:42:00] <Folabi> how do you find you have to use setTimeout shoky ?
[08:56:10] <shoky> Folabi: it's just a "trick" that works in some cases so i try it, so that the closing of the first datepicker doesn't happen in the same "execution tick" synchronously with the opening of 2nd datepicker. the delay lets the first datepicker finish closing properly before showing the 2nd
[08:57:00] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/8w8v9/3081/
[08:57:05] <Folabi> yes thanks very much, i just notice that too
[08:57:27] <shoky> MikeD_: that seems to have the same issue
[08:57:40] <MikeD_> what is the issue?
[08:57:51] <MikeD_> in firefox it works like i expected it to work
[08:58:02] <Folabi> yes focus() have the same issue too
[08:58:13] <shoky> MikeD_: that when the 2nd datepicker shows, if you click on the button for next month, it will close and open the datpicker, instead of moving to next month
[08:59:48] <MikeD_> ok yeah, that's weird.
[09:00:27] <MikeD_> that datepicker control looks almost perfect, but using it is like hitting your thumb with a hammer - it's almost not worth the pain.
[09:33:32] <Duikb00t-home> hi
[09:33:50] <Duikb00t-home> someone has a minute to look into an issue with positioning and anchor clicking? It works but I can't get the position right

[12:12:44] <Uhkis> good evening bobby
[12:17:29] <robertmaxrees> how's everybody?
[12:18:57] <Dro> Uhkis, but how to get it to its original colors after selecting other div :p
[12:20:24] <Uhkis> Dro: save that information to a variable
[12:20:56] <robertmaxrees> why not use css instead?
[12:23:12] <Dro> robertmaxrees, how?
[12:23:18] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[12:24:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p7zhy1mr/
[12:24:57] <robertmaxrees> Dro
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p7zhy1mr/1/ with a "restore" button
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:37:18] <Dro> Robdgreat, great! thats exactly what I was looking for, thank you !
[12:38:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:47:28] <ar1a> hey, i'm trying to log how many elements with a class are on the page
[12:47:37] <ar1a> console.log($('.box').count)
[12:47:39] <ar1a> is that correct?
[12:47:45] <Uhkis> length
[12:47:50] <ar1a> thanks
[12:48:05] <ar1a> ok its working, must be a problem with the lib
[12:48:06] <ar1a> ty
[12:49:14] <ar1a> nope nvm its working :D ty
[12:49:39] <ar1a> i have a sort of jquery/css question. I need to reorganise things because this jquery lib changed the height of a div and i wanna stick the button at the bottom
[12:49:41] <ar1a> should i ask here or #css
[13:06:47] <__rob> hi
[13:08:04] <__rob> if I use implicit iteration, is there a way to access the element from the outer loop
[13:08:15] <__rob> so for example  $('.some_class').children('.some_class_underneath').each(function (index, element) { ... };
[13:08:50] <__rob> how can I access the each of the elements with '.some_class'
[13:09:41] <__rob> is that possible
[13:09:46] <__rob> or do I have to use .each()
[13:12:36] <ar1a> i dont get it
[13:12:39] <ar1a> can you write some psuedocode
[13:13:10] <Uhkis> $(this).parents('.some_class') is probably what you're looking for
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> __rob are you asking how to access the parent selector when handling children?
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> because I'd invert that logic a little.
[13:19:56] <__rob> well the above is basically http://codepad.org/uLQcAaqs right ?
[13:20:26] <__rob> so I do not have access to the someclass element from the outerloop, only each child
[13:20:38] <robertmaxrees> *inner each
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need the reference to the parent?
[13:21:50] <robertmaxrees> in other words, why not  $('.some_class').each(), do you work on that element, then .find() the .some_class_underneath and do your work against it?
[13:45:12] <reyniermp> I don't know if this question is related to this channel and if it's not then apologies. I have a table with several values, some of them are inputs elements, some of them are plain text, what is the best way to grab all of them from jQuery/Javascript side?
[13:45:29] <reyniermp> I can change the code that generates the table if that's is a problem
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> reyniermp we'd have to see what it looks like.
[13:45:59] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, you want an screenshot or the code itself?
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> the actual code.
[13:46:08] <robertmaxrees> the html.
[13:46:13] <reyniermp> ok, give me a sec
[13:47:16] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, here https://gist.github.com/reypm/d5a1b74d0da9170b00f465e031f65e7f
[13:48:09] <reyniermp> I need to build kind of array for each row
[13:48:32] <reyniermp> the array keys could be each column header name
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> "array key"?
[13:49:46] <reyniermp> yeah, let me explain myself
[13:50:43] <reyniermp> give me a sec
[13:51:07] * taplar queues elevator music
[13:52:57] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, refresh the gist look at the arr file and then look at the first row of the table
[13:53:04] <reyniermp> see now what I mean?
[13:53:20] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as an "array key"
[13:53:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:53:36] <taplar> *in js
[13:53:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want an array of objects.
[13:53:57] <reyniermp> hmmm I am spoken from PHP side sorry
[13:54:04] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, yes, that's correct
[13:54:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd slap classes onto the TDs with data you care about.
[13:54:22] <reyniermp> I just need to grab the data and send it exactly as it's to the backend
[13:54:24] <robertmaxrees> then you have a quick .map().get()
[14:00:22] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, u mean something like this https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/ ??
[14:01:16] <robertmaxrees> basically.  something like that at least.
[14:01:29] <reyniermp> ok, I will need some help with that map().get()
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> the docs will be SUPER helpful there.
[14:02:10] <reyniermp> :)
[14:03:38] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, yes but I don't know what to map what would be my array?
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> you're using the jquery map
[14:04:00] <robertmaxrees> and using that to return an array.
[14:04:09] <robertmaxrees> $('tr').map();
[14:09:54] <reyniermp> hmmm robertmaxrees how do I access the class and the value element of each element? https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/1/
[14:10:06] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:10:11] <robertmaxrees> $('tr').map()
[14:10:16] <robertmaxrees> not $.map(tr heh
[14:11:24] <taplar> side note, if you did 'tbody tr' you could skip that index == 0 check
[14:11:42] <robertmaxrees> don't even need that heh
[14:12:12] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, my .map function always get an array so what should I pass into it as an array when I do $('tr').map() ??
[14:12:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:12:28] <reyniermp> taplar, thx
[14:12:38] <robertmaxrees> you want http://api.jquery.com/map/
[14:14:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k9uq1csh/2/
[14:14:15] <robertmaxrees> reyniermp
[14:19:43] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, thx I can continue from there when I finish I will come back so you check my code and see if I am doing it right
[14:20:12] <robertmaxrees> lol aight.
[14:22:53] <taplar> the more i play on S.O. the more i want to create a webpage foralljavascriptdevelopers.com that is simply an <h1> that says "IDS MUST BE UNIQUE"
[14:25:16] <Uhkis> taplar: what's stopping you? :D
[14:25:29] <taplar> i don't wanna be -that- famous
[14:25:50] <taplar> imagine the tail i'd have to turn away
[14:28:02] <reyniermp> robertmaxrees, ok, https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/3/ my first issue is the values from the second row are not populated properly
[14:28:12] <Uhkis> i think it's called <footer>
[14:28:51] <reyniermp> all of them get's undefined
[14:28:58] <robertmaxrees> reyniermp ...
[14:29:08] <robertmaxrees> you don't see why?
[14:29:20] <robertmaxrees> <td>Gates Rubber - HC - Iola</td>
[14:29:26] <robertmaxrees> vs <td class="customer">Enron</td>
[14:29:30] <reyniermp> yes
[14:29:30] <robertmaxrees> missing your classnames ;)
[14:29:35] <reyniermp> is missing the classes
[14:29:37] <reyniermp> ups
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:29:42] <reyniermp> XD
[14:41:48] <reyniermp> robertLunch, thanks, this is the latest version https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/8/ do you wanna take a look and see if there is any suggestion you would like to make?
[14:43:11] <taplar> i don't see anything that jumps out at me
[14:43:39] <taplar> maybe .prop('checked') instead of .is(":checked"), but that's just nit picking
[14:44:42] <taplar> $agreement_type.val() != '' ? $agreement_type.val() : ''  <-- this is kinda confusing
[14:44:55] <reyniermp> taplar, why?
[14:45:01] <taplar> if not blank use it
[14:45:05] <taplar> if it is blank, use blank
[14:45:18] <taplar> see the weirdness?
[14:45:36] <reyniermp> the thing is I don't mind about the first item
[14:45:48] <taplar> logically
[14:45:54] <taplar> if it is blank you use it
[14:45:57] <reyniermp> if I use the .val() always I will get it no matter what
[14:46:09] <reyniermp> ummm
[14:46:11] <taplar> right, which that logic does too
[14:46:16] <reyniermp> waits I think I know what you mean
[14:46:16] <taplar> not blank, use it.
[14:46:17] <reyniermp> waits
[14:46:52] <reyniermp> yup, I got it https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/9/
[14:46:55] <reyniermp> thanks for the heads up
[14:47:06] <taplar> :)
[14:47:36] <taplar> $items = $element; <-- what is that?
[14:48:11] <reyniermp> I was trying to group all of the objects in one big object but I couldn't make it
[14:48:21] <reyniermp> taplar, did you know a little bit PHP?
[14:48:44] <taplar> I do.  But as it is that variable isn't being used in your script right now
[14:48:56] <reyniermp> taplar, what I would like to do next is to create an array of array (PHP way) didn't know how to achieve this in jQuery
[14:49:10] <reyniermp> I leave it there bvy mistake
[14:49:35] <taplar> right now you have an array of objects.  which translating that to php you have an array of associative arrays
[14:50:53] <reyniermp> taplar, but I am seeing three different objects there one per row https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/10/
[14:51:21] <taplar> right
[14:51:37] <taplar> i'm not understanding your concern currently
[14:53:26] <reyniermp> so the idea behind this is to send a bunch of rows to PHP side so I can process them, right now I am not seeing how to send that bunch but one at a time
[14:53:34] <reyniermp> I don't know if I make myself clear
[14:54:02] <taplar> you don't have to send them one at a time.  that's just how they are logging in the console
[14:54:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/k9uq1csh/11/
[14:54:33] <Duikb00t-home> hi
[14:54:39] <Duikb00t-home> oooh taplar
[14:54:41] <taplar> you will be able to send that across ajax to the php and it will get them all at once
[14:54:46] <taplar> hey Duikb00t-home
[14:54:47] <reyniermp> taplar, ohhhh I complete forgot about the function below
[14:54:48] <Duikb00t-home> Can I ask you something small in a private message?
[14:54:53] <Duikb00t-home> My day is ruined by jquery today :D
[14:54:57] <reyniermp> yup that is correct
[14:55:03] <taplar> if it's jquery related i'd rather you ask in the room
[14:55:03] <reyniermp> thanks taplar
[14:55:09] <taplar> reyniermp: sure
[14:55:14] <Duikb00t-home> hmm I have to share the url ok
[14:56:11] <Duikb00t-home> So ok taplar :
[14:56:13] <Duikb00t-home> https://goo.gl/e7iKmb   That url
[14:56:23] <Duikb00t-home> after the introduction you have 3 big bars
[14:56:36] <Duikb00t-home> Gites - Kamers and Zaal
[14:56:40] <Duikb00t-home> PRess Kamers for example
[14:56:46] <Duikb00t-home> And click on details.
[14:56:57] <Duikb00t-home> you have now the details page open right?
[14:57:09] <taplar> not yet, my network is being super slow loading this page
[14:57:10] <Duikb00t-home> Now in the green bar on top you see : 'home  kamers - de romantische kamer ' fur example
[14:57:12] <Duikb00t-home> ok
[14:57:53] <Duikb00t-home> After you are on the detail page click in the green bar on -kamers again. I would like to go to the homepage, and open that accordion item that has been clicked. I pass the #anchor in the url . but it's not opening . :(
[14:58:02] <taplar> alright i did a translate on the page.  what is Kamers in english?
[14:58:19] <Duikb00t-home> Rooms
[14:58:29] <Duikb00t-home> IT navigates to siteurl/#anchor-kamers
[14:58:34] <taplar> yep
[14:58:36] <Duikb00t-home> But it opens always the yellow bar
[14:58:42] <Duikb00t-home> it should be the second on in this case ><
[14:58:55] <Duikb00t-home> I really I am doing this for more then 8 hours atm :D and Can't get any success full result
[14:59:03] <Duikb00t-home> I can strip the hashtag of it etc etc but its always opening the yellow one.
[14:59:30] <Duikb00t-home> Oh and to open one I should set a checkbox property to checked (input ) which I try to do...
[15:00:20] <taplar> maybe related to your problem
[15:00:35] <taplar> if you double click Kamers it shifts again
[15:00:38] <Duikb00t-home> yes
[15:00:48] <Duikb00t-home> I saw that too
[15:02:06] <taplar> ok, so just looking at it, if you are at the very top you see the red bar at the top
[15:02:06] <taplar> ?
[15:02:23] <Duikb00t-home> yes
[15:02:36] <taplar> it seems like the second click scrolls up the height of that red bar
[15:02:54] <Duikb00t-home> hmmm
[15:03:19] <alexidoia> I have a problem, I can't seems to use say $(span.truc).click(.... on something that I have appended to the DOM, is that normal ?
[15:03:41] <taplar> what is span.truc?
[15:03:41] <Duikb00t-home> pfff im trying to see what goes wrong
[15:04:27] <alexidoia> taplar: a span with class="truc"
[15:04:45] <taplar> then you are missing the quotes around that if that is meant to be a string selector
[15:05:13] <Duikb00t-home> That click isreally strange
[15:05:17] <alexidoia> sure taplar I have them on my script
[15:05:55] <alexidoia> taplar: the question was more "Can I trigger some element that is not original in the DOM"
[15:05:57] <taplar> ok, so then right before that line do console.log($('span.truc').length); and see what you get
[15:06:01] <taplar> yes you can
[15:06:12] <taplar> $() searches the dom at that point in time
[15:07:02] <alexidoia> taplar: before the $("span.truc").click(function() {... ?
[15:07:06] <taplar> yes
[15:07:39] <alexidoia> taplar: I am sorry where is the console supposed to be shown ?
[15:07:57] <taplar> F12 to open your developer tools.  There will be a console tab
[15:09:21] <alexidoia> taplar: I found it but difficult to know what to look for
[15:09:41] <Duikb00t-home> hml
[15:09:43] <taplar> when you get there, reload your page or do whatever that would cause that logic to execute.  you should see it print a number in there
[15:10:15] <alexidoia> I am there and no nothing is printed out
[15:10:31] <taplar> nothing you do is causing a number to print in the console?
[15:10:38] <taplar> even refreshing?
[15:10:42] <Duikb00t-home> I can even get the elemtn stuff argh [input#tab-five, prevObject: jQuery.fn.init(1)] ;p
[15:10:42] <alexidoia> nope
[15:10:50] <taplar> then that is saying that logic is not executing
[15:17:00] <alexidoia> my script is within $(document).ready(function() { } is that what might cause the problem ?
[15:17:22] <taplar> no, that just makes the script wait until the document is parsed into the dom before executing
[15:17:32] <taplar> can you show us in a jsfiddle.net what you are trying?
[15:17:40] <alexidoia> yeah that is what I though but I don't see what the problem is
[15:18:37] <alexidoia> I even have the css targeting correctly the element, I don't see what I can't target it with jquery
[15:18:57] <taplar> css will apply regardless of when it is added.  js is more time specific
[15:18:57] <alexidoia> moreover, I tried to target some other element to see if it is not my code, and it works
[15:21:37] <alexidoia> taplar: can I sort of refresh the dom once I have appended content to it ?
[15:21:41] <alexidoia> so to be sure
[15:21:55] <taplar> you don't have to.
[15:22:33] <taplar> again, can you share what you are trying to do in a jsfiddle?  because something about your logic is causing that part of the code to not execute
[15:22:43] <taplar> otherwise you would have seen the console.log
[15:23:27] <alexidoia> its difficult I am in a on page site on a wordpress theme :)
[15:23:47] <taplar> i just need to see the logic in question
[15:24:12] <alexidoia> but I don't know what to show you :)
[15:24:25] <taplar> you said it was in a document ready
[15:24:27] <taplar> that part
[15:24:36] <alexidoia> taplar: if you go there http://new.stephanie-cazaentre.com/category/collaborations/ then click on the image at the top right
[15:25:31] <alexidoia> when you click on the image, a hidden div is being filled and shown, in that div the little image at the bottom should do the exact same thing with some other content.
[15:31:54] <alexidoia> taplar: it is actually impossible to trigger any element that is not original
[15:32:06] <taplar> ok, so i think you have a data issue here
[15:32:11] <taplar> that's not correct
[15:32:20] <taplar> i know for a fact that you can
[15:32:26] <taplar> it appears you have data issues
[15:32:39] <alexidoia> what do you mean by data issues ?
[15:33:05] <taplar> inside your fillSingleDisplay method you are referencing 'singles' to get your data for that modal thing you are doing
[15:33:22] <alexidoia> yes
[15:33:39] <alexidoia> and ?
[15:33:42] <taplar> of which there are 8 elements, only element 6 has a 'relatedcontent' value set
[15:33:52] <alexidoia> yes
[15:33:56] <taplar> the ones before that element is an empty array, and element 7 has a value of a string
[15:34:08] <alexidoia> yes
[15:34:10] <alexidoia> ...
[15:34:13] <taplar> is that not an issue?
[15:34:31] <taplar> you are using that variable to create your singleRelatedContent
[15:35:04] <alexidoia> I don't have always relatedContent
[15:35:25] <alexidoia> some projects have some don't, is that an issue ?
[15:35:44] <taplar> i thought so, but if that is your intention then ok.
[15:35:52] <taplar> where is the logic that you were talking about?
[15:37:04] <alexidoia> every click on the image will fill the single. Some have related content, some don't. Once the single is filled it is shown, there, I can't select any content with $(...)
[15:37:23] <alexidoia> anycontent that has been appended that is
[15:37:39] <taplar> where in the code are you trying to do what you were talking about before with $('span.truc') ?
[15:38:14] <alexidoia> it is actually $("a.displaySingle").click(function() { line 64 of main.js
[15:38:25] <taplar> k
[15:39:06] <alexidoia> it is the same function that is called on the original image. I only added the same class in the generated content (so that I don't have to change anything in my script)
[15:39:58] <taplar> so where are you creating new ones?
[15:40:54] <taplar> because that only runs on page load
[15:41:06] <taplar> meaning the binding will only exist on the element that existed at page load time
[15:41:25] <taplar> *elements
[15:41:53] <alexidoia> the div singleDisplay exists from the beginning, I don't understand what you are saying
[15:42:06] <taplar> the div?
[15:42:11] <taplar> that selector is looking for a tags
[15:43:35] <alexidoia> <div id="singleRelatedContent"> exists empty at page load, each image have an id, when click that id allow jQuery to search in an array for content to be put into <div id="singleRelatedContent">
[15:43:51] <taplar> ok?  what does that have to do with that binding?
[15:44:06] <alexidoia> what do you call binging ?
[15:44:15] <taplar> $("a.displaySingle").click(function() {
[15:44:20] <taplar> that is an event binding
[15:44:24] <alexidoia> ok
[15:45:14] <alexidoia> each image is within a a.displaySingle so when you click on an image, that is the event binding that occur
[15:45:20] <taplar> yep
[15:47:33] <taplar> so where's the problem?
[15:49:53] <alexidoia> when you click on an original image, it add content to the single, it had another image within a that when click should change the content of the single, it does not
[15:50:09] <alexidoia> within a a*
[15:50:15] <taplar> right, cause it's a new image, that did not exist when the original bindings took place
[15:50:27] <alexidoia> exactly
[15:50:33] <taplar> $("a.truc").click(function() { alert('bug') }); <-- this happens at page load
[15:50:46] <taplar> any new 'a.truc' that you create will not have that binding on them
[15:50:54] <taplar> you have to apply that binding to them after you create the new ones
[15:51:00] <alexidoia> that what I thought !
[15:51:01] <taplar> OR change it to be a delegate binding instead
[15:51:10] <alexidoia> how to do that ?
[15:51:33] <taplar> are all the 'a.truc' going to be in that modal thing?
[15:51:42] <alexidoia> yes
[15:51:48] <taplar> is there an id on that modal?
[15:52:09] <taplar> and does that modal exist on page load?
[15:52:10] <alexidoia> no just class since all a shared it
[15:52:15] <alexidoia> no
[15:52:28] <taplar> ok, then for simplicity
[15:52:46] <taplar> $(document.body).on('click', 'a.truc', function(){ /* do your stuff here */ });
[15:53:57] <alexidoia> ok
[15:57:14] <taplar> What that does is puts a click binding on the body, which will already exist on page load.
[15:57:24] <taplar> It then listens for events from any of it's children.
[15:57:44] <taplar> if the child matches the selector, in this case 'a.truc', it applies the handler against that event
[15:58:07] <taplar> Since it is doing all of this off of events that bubble up to it from it's children, it doesn't care when the children were created.  Just that it gets the event
[15:59:00] <alexidoia> taplar: oh yes it works !!!
[15:59:08] <alexidoia> taplar: thanks a bunch !
[15:59:31] <taplar> yep.  but just to make sure.  so you understand that you can select new elements you add to the dom, right?
[16:00:00] <taplar> just that your binding was not re-running
[16:01:06] <alexidoia> ok, and there is no other way to rerun the bindings ?
[16:01:36] <taplar> sure, you can put the binding login in a function that you can call whenever.  issue with that is you don't want to re-bind on the ones that already existed
[16:01:46] <taplar> delegate binding is really the best way to handle that kinda thing
[16:01:55] <taplar> r/login/logic
[16:02:35] <alexidoia> in your code using $(this) will target what  ?
[16:02:50] <taplar> whatever 'this' is, contextually
[16:03:05] <taplar> within an event handler, 'this' will be the element that the event originated from
[16:03:25] <taplar> or is being handled for
[16:04:19] <alexidoia> okay thanks a lot for your time ! I'm gonna eat now!
[16:04:29] <taplar> enjoy!
[16:05:54] <reyniermp> me again XD
[16:06:24] <reyniermp> how do I check if a <td> content is just text or if it has some kind of HTML input?
[16:07:12] <taplar> what is the concern if it has html input?
[16:07:52] <reyniermp> taplar, yes wait a sec let me try to showing something
[16:11:07] <reyniermp> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/12/ the idea is for columns agreement_type, cfprogramlevel, startdate and enddate, if there is an INPUT or SELECT gets it's .val() if not then get the .closest('td').data('id')
[16:11:46] <taplar> ok, then what you can do is check the children().length
[16:12:07] <taplar> children() returns any Elements that exist in the parent, excluding text nodes
[16:12:08] <reyniermp> taplar, my solution so far is start_date: $startdate.val() ? $startdate.val() : $.trim($this.find('.start_date_txt').text()),
[16:12:48] <reyniermp> ah waits startdate and enddate doesn't have .data('id') so for those two I need the text
[16:13:21] <reyniermp> ummm nvm I can write the same value I am showing as data-id and that cause less issues
[16:13:30] <taplar> heh
[16:17:03] <reyniermp> taplar, isn't suppose that `console.log($('#agreement_type_txt').children());`  for the second element returns lenght:1 ?? ==> https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/13/
[16:18:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/k9uq1csh/14/
[16:18:58] <taplar> class, not it
[16:19:24] <reyniermp> oh f ... k to much code for today :D
[16:19:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/k9uq1csh/15/
[16:20:07] <reyniermp> taplar, k thx
[16:20:16] <taplar> could i make a suggestion?
[16:20:20] <reyniermp> sure
[16:20:43] <taplar> for the columns that do not have inputs that can change, you might consider putting their text values on your tr and data-* elements
[16:20:50] <taplar> r/and/as
[16:21:13] <taplar> then you could just find the tr and get those values off of it
[16:21:25] <reyniermp> ummm
[16:21:29] <reyniermp> an example?
[16:21:34] <taplar> sure, one sec
[16:21:40] <reyniermp> taplar, thx in advance
[16:26:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/era332gn/
[16:27:48] <reyniermp> taplar, this look better than what I've
[16:27:48] <reyniermp> thx
[16:27:56] <reyniermp> I got the idea let me change my code
[16:27:57] <taplar> sure
[16:28:08] <reyniermp> *better and cleaner
[16:28:32] <reyniermp> ups I have a problem
[16:29:01] <reyniermp> the way I am building this doesn't allow me to write all the values as data-* on the tr
[16:29:35] <reyniermp> because ... nvm ... f ... c again to much code let me try something
[16:29:40] <taplar> ;)
[16:29:47] <taplar> make small steps
[16:30:48] <reyniermp> yup
[16:48:17] <reyniermp> taplar, this case is valid as well https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/era332gn/1/ and it's not working
[16:48:31] <reyniermp> should I check the length in that case?
[16:48:45] <reyniermp> to see if the td has a input|select or a text?
[16:49:14] <taplar> so you have columns that intermix text and inputs?
[16:49:20] <reyniermp> yes sir
[16:49:58] <reyniermp> taplar, look here https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/k9uq1csh/12/ you will see text and inputs mixed
[16:51:54] <reyniermp> and then I've another problem I need to send also the value of the checked checkbox
[16:52:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/era332gn/2/
[16:53:11] <reyniermp> thx I got the idea
[16:53:39] <reyniermp> can you add the part for send the value of the checked checkboxes? and example?
[16:53:48] <phelix> what would be the best route to create an array of items I want to allow. like var allowedParemeters = ['zip', 'address'] and then parse the url and only allow the url that contains those parameters be allowed? url example: test.com?zip=xxxx&address=xxxx  I don't care what xxx is just only want to allow urls that contain zip and address parameter
[16:53:50] <reyniermp> I hope not be bothering you so much
[16:54:22] <taplar> reyniermp: nah, your not, i'm actually thinking of changing how this works from the things you are asking
[16:54:56] <reyniermp> taplar, ohh ok more improvements? you're awesome man thanks a lot
[17:01:37] <taplar> mm, dunno if this will be smaller or not
[17:03:35] <reyniermp> taplar, I've to jump into a meeting leave me what you're doing here and I'll be watching it
[17:03:50] <reyniermp> don't worry if it's too large
[17:03:53] <reyniermp> that doesn't matter
[17:08:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/era332gn/3/
[17:08:21] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/6rg7s4c7/ this is what I currently have. Not quite sure how to update this so that field can be an array. And the url parameters must match available parameters from field
[17:08:59] <taplar> phelix: is this intended to be used with a framework of some sort?
[17:09:36] <phelix> nope, just need pure js to detect the url and only allow specific urls that contain specific parameters
[17:09:55] <taplar> but for this to run they would already be on the page
[17:10:35] <robertLunch> phelix what format are you looking for?
[17:10:39] <robertLunch> can you pop that into the fiddle?
[17:10:42] <phelix> welll if someone goes to say www.mypage.com?fo=bar and fo does not exist in fields I want it to reditect to a 404
[17:10:51] <taplar> ah
[17:11:17] <phelix> but if i have multiple items in field array if any one of those match it needs to allow it
[17:11:29] <robertmaxrees> you want a server-side solution for that it sounds like.
[17:11:44] <phelix> trying to keep this with js
[17:11:56] <robertmaxrees> is this a public-facing site?
[17:11:59] <taplar> i might suggest ##javascript for this then
[17:12:36] <phelix> well jquer
[17:12:40] <phelix> jquery
[17:12:44] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't handle urls ;)
[17:12:48] <taplar> ^^^
[17:12:53] <phelix> ahh :)
[17:13:13] <taplar> we got a broody DOM to take care of
[17:13:33] * taplar bows to his mistress
[17:13:35] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> also: if you care about SEO at all this is a bad idea.
[17:16:11] <phelix> Say I just had a string that looked like a url.. How would this go about being done with jquery lol
[17:16:24] <taplar> you wouldn't
[17:16:30] <taplar> has nothing to do with dom elements
[17:16:38] <taplar> pure js logic
[17:16:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:16:42] <phelix> ahh
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> phelix why are you so adamant that this be done client-side?
[17:18:04] <phelix> Because there is already some code that allows specific url data and its already in this location. It needs to be done in here. Big company and would take all sorts of approvals and BS to try and change how this is already approved and working
[17:18:50] <taplar> what if i throw in my debugger and make your matching algorithm pass when it shouldn't?
[17:18:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:19:53] <phelix> It won't be a big deal
[17:20:10] <phelix> just only want specific url paremeters to be allowed or redirected to a 404.. If one gets through its no big deal
[17:20:22] <taplar> so, who do it in the first place?
[17:20:24] <phelix> no security risk or anything
[17:20:39] <taplar> r/who/why
[17:21:06] <phelix> Its for some tracking. They only wanted specific url paths to be allowed on this page. But then releazed that for tracking some types or query parameters will need to be accepted.
[17:21:50] <taplar> so they would show up in the tracking when they wouldn't want them too?
[17:22:52] <phelix> no, its hard to explain.. for our travel page we only want www.page.com/travel/hotel or /cruise or /car if its / something else it needs to go to 404. But some places have referrals that are tracked that will be like /cruise?foo=bar and its currently sending those to 404
[17:23:11] <phelix> where if some specific parameters are in the url it needs to still allow it to view the page.
[17:23:14] <phelix> if that makes sense.
[17:23:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we do stuff kind of like that here all the time.
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> this is relatively trivial fwiw.
[17:26:52] <robertmaxrees> is the "allowed" list just an array of QSP nmames?
[17:28:33] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:29:20] <taplar> we go live june 5th man, :D
[17:29:26] <robertmaxrees> niiiiiice
[17:29:36] <taplar> super ready for it to be out there
[17:30:14] <taplar> it was funny though, the last week or so we've kinda hammered down on testing mobile devices and stuff
[17:30:24] <taplar> even got physical devices from our ecom team to test with
[17:30:47] <taplar> then i got access to our analytics and looked at the number of mobile devices in the past two years....
[17:30:54] <robertmaxrees> heh yep.
[17:31:00] <robertmaxrees> we're on a similar push right now.
[17:32:02] <robertmaxrees> phelix
[17:39:49] <phelix> yes
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qof6834m/
[17:42:08] <robertmaxrees> pretty trivial concept.
[17:46:46] <reyniermp> taplar, that's amazing
[17:46:57] <reyniermp> I've to go now but will be working from home later and this weekend
[17:47:08] <taplar> you poor poor man
[17:47:21] <reyniermp> taplar, yes :'(
[22:57:44] <comptekki__> if i start using jquery ui do i need to include the base jquery also, or is there a built in one used?
