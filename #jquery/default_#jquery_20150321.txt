[04:08:49] <jquery506> Hi. How would I modify the renderCalculator function to slideUp the recipes and slideDown the results of the recipe calculation? Both animation functions should be chained together. Thanks. http://pastebin.com/UrvJU6zZ

[05:03:47] <muff_potter> Are there any circumstances that would make .push() not work and keep pushing values to slot 0...? isnt the whole point of .push() to increment?
[05:05:00] <rcyr> push adds to the end.
[05:05:12] <rcyr> unshift adds to the beginning
[05:05:59] <rcyr> push is like the "push" of a "stack" datastructure(pop is obviously available too)
[05:13:52] <muff_potter> rcyr: for instance: if I have an .on() click function inside which I have a new piece of data being dynamically added with the same line of code: "array.push(data.newData)", that should push each new piece to a new slot right? for some reason it keeps overwriting the first one...
[05:14:57] <rcyr> Perhaps you're reinitializing the array everytime? (Can I see that part of your code?)
[05:17:56] <muff_potter> rcyr: lol I am doing that
[05:17:59] <muff_potter> rcyr: thanks
[05:57:03] <muff_potter> li elements being dynamically created with same class name and different piece of information (a number), how do I select just the most recently created li element and it's corresponding piece of information with selecting all of them and without having to give them all unique class names? is that possible?
[05:59:28] <rcyr> muff_potter: You need some way to discriminate them, perhaps you could add a timestamp to them at the moment of their creation.
[06:29:27] <decx> if you create them you already know about them
[07:31:06] <Sal> can someone tell me what this syntax does : +function ($) { ... };
[07:32:55] <arthurvr> Sal: You mean it being used like this? http://jsbin.com/nutivujece/1/edit
[07:33:30] <arthurvr> Sal: Like that’s it’s basically works like an IIFE
[07:33:34] <arthurvr> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[07:33:50] <arthurvr> The plus operator forces it to a number, and thus, executes the function.
[07:33:58] <Sal> yep
[07:34:01] <Sal> right like that
[07:34:51] <arthurvr> Sal: This way is more common: http://jsbin.com/piwatugofi/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:35:01] <arthurvr> Sal: It uses boolean convertion.
[07:35:24] <Sal> +function ($) {
[07:35:25] <Sal>     'use strict';
[07:35:31] <Sal> this is how i have it
[07:35:33] <Sal> what is it?
[07:35:42] <Sal> a jquery function definition?
[07:36:06] <arthurvr> Exactly what I said, an IIFE, that gets passed jQuery as an argument (scoping, you know)
[07:36:21] <arthurvr> Or are you wondering about the use strict?
[07:37:04] <Sal> no
[07:37:08] <Sal> an IIFE?
[07:37:28] <arthurvr> Sal: check the link I posted.
[07:37:32] <arthurvr> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[07:37:36] <arthurvr> Immediately-Invoked Function Expression
[07:37:44] <arthurvr> It’s handy to not leak globals.
[07:38:41] <Sal> and its done with the starting plus char?
[07:39:07] <Velveeta> nope, with a starting open parens
[07:39:14] <Velveeta> (function ($) {
[07:39:35] <arthurvr> Not in the way you pasted in here: +function ($) {
[07:39:51] <arthurvr> which is functionally equal.
[07:40:14] <Sal> ok
[07:40:20] <arthurvr> The plus character forces type covertion, and thus it forces the function to execute.
[07:40:21] <Sal> i got it
[07:40:26] <Sal> i'll leave it liek it is
[07:40:53] <Sal> liek=like
[07:40:54] <Sal> thanks
[07:45:11] <Velveeta> i've never seen that syntax for an iife before, interesting
[07:45:43] <arthurvr> Velveeta: There are hunderds of ways to write an iife :D
[07:46:03] <arthurvr> Most commonly it’s just (function () {}())
[07:46:16] <Velveeta> right, that's the only one i've ever used
[08:00:23] <decx> isnt there one with ~ too?
[08:02:09] <arthurvr> decx: Yes!

[09:33:01] <BillCriswell> You don't need the .text(), especially since it's not a jQuery method.

[10:16:02] <jquery904> Hi. Why aren't the slideUp and slideDown (lines 174 & 175) sliding after the Calculate Weekly Total button is clicked? Am I supposed to hide something? http://jsfiddle.net/1e5jqw9j/5/
[10:28:21] <gnarf> jquery904: slideDown will only do something if it starts out hidden
[10:28:31] <gnarf> can try .hide().slideDown()
[10:30:52] <autrilla_> Why is this invalid? $('.sidebar').toggle("slide", "left", 500);
[10:31:48] <damarusama> noob here, when I want to move my document.ready(function) outside the html, should I copy the code within that function into an external file?
[10:32:28] <damarusama> or should the external file have a document.ready(function) - and is there any change I have to do to the code when I want to have an external file instead of inline code
[10:34:38] <shoky> damarusama: it should have the same code as the inline script
[10:37:56] <gnarf> autrilla_: ui effects?
[10:38:10] <gnarf> autrilla_: that seems like a jquery ui effects type animation, have you included it?
[10:41:40] <autrilla_> gnarf, I just have jquery
[10:41:51] <autrilla_> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js
[10:41:57] <gnarf> there is no .toggle("slide") in jquery core
[10:42:03] <gnarf> thats added by ui effects
[10:42:30] <sc_> or it is just toggeling the class slide
[10:42:32] <autrilla_> Does jquery core have something to make slideToggle go from left to right instead of up and down?
[10:42:39] <gnarf> autrilla_ no
[10:42:45] <sc_> .slideDown() .slideUp()
[10:43:07] <autrilla_> gnarf, why?
[10:43:30] <gnarf> autrilla_ it is actually kind of an ugly effect if the thing has text in it, but you might be able to use .animate({ width: 'toggle' })
[10:43:47] <sc_> and .slideToggle() does exist
[10:44:06] <autrilla_> sc_, I know
[10:44:25] <autrilla_> gnarf, yeah, that is not pretty. It does the job though
[10:44:27] <sc_> i didn't
[10:44:29] <sc_> as i never used it
[10:44:31] <sc_> :)
[10:45:25] <gnarf> autrilla_: you might need to manually wire up hide/show at some point on it too
[10:45:36] <autrilla_> :(
[10:45:44] <autrilla_> Why isn't there a slideToggle for left to right
[10:45:47] <autrilla_> It's just weird
[10:46:01] <autrilla_> If you make up and down, you might as well do left and right
[10:46:06] <gnarf> autrilla_: because it's ugly and awkward if the box doesn't have static height
[10:46:49] <autrilla_> The same way it would be weird to do it up and down if the box doesn't have static width
[10:46:54] <gnarf> nope
[10:47:07] <gnarf> because flow wont make width grow/shrink in html
[10:47:26] <autrilla_> ah
[10:48:16] <autrilla_> So what's the way to do it properly?
[10:48:37] <adavia> hi guys is this ok $('radio[name=gender]').val() ?
[10:48:38] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/1-11-stable/tests/visual/effects/all.html
[10:48:46] <gnarf> blind does a better job of the effect
[10:48:53] <gnarf> blind or slide
[10:49:47] <autrilla_> Do I need to keep track of the state?
[10:50:21] <autrilla_> And does that use jQuery UI or just jQuery core?
[10:50:26] <gnarf> thats ui effects
[10:50:30] <gnarf> you can install that standalone
[10:51:13] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/effect-slide.js
[10:51:44] <autrilla_> Or use UI

[20:09:06] <lambdumb> if I use jQuery's .hide effect to hide an element that contains forms, are those forms and their data still accessible?
[20:10:26] <gobbie> yea

[20:10:35] <gobbie> just adds css to hide it
[20:10:48] <gobbie> doesnt remove it from dom
[20:11:57] <lambdumb> gobbie is it possible to remove it from dom? I have rows with forms that are treated as arrays and I would like to be able to remove/add rows
[20:12:13] <lambdumb> although there's never going to be more than a certain number of rows
[20:13:23] <guffzill> $( ".hello" ).remove();
[20:13:45] <guffzill> removes from dom
[20:14:18] <gobbie> yea .remove() is what your looking for
[20:14:58] <lambdumb> oh, awesome
[20:15:08] <lambdumb> can an element be re-added once it's removed?
[20:16:02] <guffzill> you could store the html and repopulate it
[20:16:07] <gobbie> yea
[20:16:13] <gobbie> or create a new element and add that new one
[20:17:07] <lambdumb> maybe .detach would be better?
[20:19:00] <gobbie> never really used .detach so I can’t say…
[20:19:28] <gobbie> The .detach() method is the same as .remove(), except that .detach() keeps all jQuery data associated with the removed elements. This method is useful when removed elements are to be reinserted into the DOM at a later time.
[20:19:42] <gobbie> seems like a sure fire bet to me 8)
[20:32:49] <lambdumb> http://jsfiddle.net/cvorL2k3/ how should i go about making this work with .detach? should i give each table row its own unique id?

[21:40:16] <gobbie> https://api.jqueryui.com/transfer-effect/ shows an example of using it.. dunno if that helps

[22:15:07] <lambdumb> how can i set a button to do another function after it's already been clicked?
