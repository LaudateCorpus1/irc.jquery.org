[00:00:10] <munderwo> abjorn: and it doesnt have apt-get?
[00:00:22] <abjorn> it does
[00:00:28] <abjorn> just shit for software sources
[00:00:37] <bambanx> Guys anyone can help me with jqzoom , how can i move the zone of magnifyng glass on this example? http://www.riscoq.cl/test/lupa.html
[00:00:57] <abjorn> guess I need to find what software sources git and curl are in and add them
[00:01:05] <munderwo> abjorn: oh, i see its pointing at repos that dont have anything in them..
[00:01:12] <abjorn> basically
[00:01:39] <munderwo> abjorn: ahh, wells thats a bit wierd, but luckily not to difficult.. just annoying i guess.
[00:01:52] <munderwo> whos the vps with? if you dont mind me asking?
[00:02:06] <abjorn> http://volumedrive.com/
[00:02:21] <abjorn> they're cheap so I guess I shouldn't expect too much
[00:03:36] <munderwo> abjorn: wow! they are really cheap!.. where are they located?
[00:04:35] <abjorn> it doesn't really list where they are
[00:04:41] <abjorn> but it seems they're SOMEWHERE in the US
[00:05:18] <munderwo> abjorn: right.. yeah really only interested in country... hmm.. any other issues so far with them besides, the crappy apt source list?
[00:06:46] <munderwo> abjorn: the east coast or west coast doesnt really matter when your in australia :)
[00:07:09] <abjorn> well I'm just getting started with them so it's hard to tell
[00:07:46] <munderwo> abjorn: how much do they charge for extra bandwidth?
[00:08:18] <abjorn> it seems I'd have to either email them or go over my bandwidth to find out
[00:09:19] <abjorn> I wasn't looking for a VPS to do anything for production, just looking for something to host a couple things on, mostly some nodejs testing and game servers lol so I just looked for the cheapest thing
[00:09:42] <munderwo> abjorn: hmm... and they only have ubuntu 9.10 ... not so great... It might be too late for you but I sue gandi.net in france (althoguh I think they have opened a US data center. they are pretty cheap.. although not as much computer resources, but more bandwidth..
[00:10:09] <abjorn> I'm not particularly interested in bandwidth
[00:10:55] <munderwo> abjorn: fair enough.. just some more info... but they look pretty good. EC2 can actually a bit expensive compared to some of these other VPS hosting places..
[00:11:07] <abjorn> yeah
[00:11:34] <abjorn> media temple has a really top notch service, but pretty pricey
[00:12:13] <munderwo> abjorn: yeah, i think its like anything, you get what you pay for. hey you havent used the autocomplete() function before for from fields?
[00:12:43] <abjorn> nope
[00:13:10] <munderwo> abjorn: bugger... getting a no method error when trying to call it... grrr...

[00:23:06] <abjorn> I dream of coldhead constantly
[00:23:58] <juha____> i had a dream where coldhead tweeted something gold, when i woke up, i didn't remember anything of the tweet, also, i shouldn't be using twitter so much..
[00:24:39] <abjorn> rofl
[00:25:00] <abjorn> I've started using twitter way too much. And like 2 months ago I hated twitter and refused to use it...
[00:25:27] <juha____> it took me 2 years to get 200 tweets, now it seems to take less than 6 months :P
[00:25:48] <coldhead> i'm not sure that was a dream, juha____
[00:38:54] <thomedy> hello im not sure what im doing wrong
[00:39:01] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/jPYWcjG8
[00:39:09] <thomedy> i have followed the tutorial
[00:39:16] <thomedy> andi have made my jquery work before
[00:39:25] <thomedy> and this is similar to what i see
[00:39:28] <thomedy> but its not working
[00:39:37] <coldhead> how is it not working?
[00:39:42] <thomedy> its not doing anything
[00:39:46] <thomedy> im trying to build an animate
[00:39:52] <thomedy> which i thought i had finally figured out
[00:40:10] <coldhead> this should be throwing an error in your debugger
[00:40:15] <coldhead> ?eval 300px
[00:40:16] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[00:40:22] <coldhead> ?eval '300px'
[00:40:23] <bot-t> coldhead: "300px"
[00:40:40] <coldhead> see? 300px needs to be a quoted string
[00:40:52] <thomedy> yeah was that tho only ting i was missing
[00:41:05] <coldhead> it looks okay apart from that
[00:41:08] <coldhead> that's a deal breaker
[00:41:16] <thomedy> well that makes me feel better though
[00:41:22] <coldhead> if it still doesn't work get it up on jsfiddle and we'll have a working demo
[00:41:34] <thomedy> its not an agredgious error
[00:41:34] <coldhead> yeah you should feel pretty good! it's coming along fine
[00:41:43] <coldhead> egregious*
[00:41:43] <munderwo> coldhead: hi, have you used the autocomplete() function from jquery-ui?
[00:41:47] <thomedy> sorry
[00:42:09] <thomedy> i may not be able to spell but you spill some toothpicks on the floor
[00:42:14] <coldhead> i don't use jquery-ui sorry munderwo
[00:42:16] <thomedy> i can tell you how many in 1 and 1/2 sec
[00:42:28] <coldhead> hahaha good job thomedy
[00:42:42] <coldhead> spelling is basically the only thing i'm any good at
[00:43:07] <munderwo> coldhead: have you used any jquery that allows you to autocomplete a form field?
[00:43:30] <coldhead> no munderwo, but i believe the UI autocomplete is quite good for that
[00:43:35] <coldhead> is it giving you trouble?
[00:44:34] <munderwo> coldhead: yeah, I keep getting a Object has no method 'autocomplete' error... and its pointing at jquery 1.5.1.js that ive imported in.
[00:45:10] <coldhead> munderwo: are you using the latest versions of UI and jquery?
[00:45:21] <coldhead> UI is pretty version dependent
[00:45:51] <munderwo> ahh right... well I was looking at the demo, and I just imported the ones that they imported..
[00:46:38] <coldhead> that should work if the demo works then >: \
[00:46:53] <coldhead> but newer less buggy versions are always nice
[00:47:36] <munderwo> hmm yeah. maybe i'll have a look around for what the lastest versions are... what is the lasted verion of jquery #lazyirc

[00:50:48] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[00:51:01] <munderwo> coldhead: just a quick question. if I import the jquery script below where I use it, will it still work?
[00:51:26] <coldhead> munderwo: if you wrap your usage in a .ready() then it should work
[00:51:46] <munderwo> coldhead: cheers! makes sense
[00:56:11] <thomedy> you can animate just off of document . ready correct?
[00:56:38] <thomedy> i gotta get better at this jquery nonsense i plan on doing a lot with it
[00:57:15] <coldhead> you can animate inside $(document).ready() provided the element exists at that time
[00:57:21] <coldhead> which it should, if it's in the HTML
[00:57:40] <thomedy> okay check my height is working until i get rid of the click thing
[01:00:42] <coldhead> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/xQpqV/
[01:00:57] <coldhead> jsfiddle is really good for messing around, in case you've not used it before
[01:01:11] <gym_jane> guys, how can i change this from id="g-plusone" to a class? http://jsfiddle.net/Wfsb8/
[01:01:26] <thomedy> i have before but i couldn't remember if i needed to put my tags in like<body> and what not'
[01:01:34] <thomedy> anyway ima check it out real queick
[01:02:13] <coldhead> gym_jane: i don't see any jquery in your code?
[01:03:04] <Deele> gym_jane wont $('#g-plusone').attr('id','').addClass('g-plusone') be enough?
[01:03:33] <gnarf> gym_jane: i dunno - but take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/Wfsb8/1/ for a proper fiddle
[01:03:48] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/xQpqV/
[01:03:50] <coldhead> hello gnarf
[01:04:04] <gnarf> hi coldhead
[01:04:06] <thomedy> im a send it right back to you i don't know why
[01:04:13] <thomedy> i takeout the click function
[01:04:16] <thomedy> and i lose my animationg
[01:04:40] <coldhead> because outside of the click function it doesn't know what 'this' is anymore
[01:04:48] <thomedy> i thought i changed it to div
[01:04:49] <thomedy> sorry
[01:05:07] <thomedy> let me look cuz i thought i chganged that this to a div
[01:05:24] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/xQpqV/1/ #worksforme
[01:06:09] <thomedy> i figured it out
[01:06:16] <thomedy> i  had one too many of the });
[01:06:17] <thomedy> in it
[01:06:24] <thomedy> i just forgot to erase that
[01:06:25] <gnarf> coldhead: did you see https://gist.github.com/1003630 yet?
[01:06:32] <thomedy> me?
[01:06:40] <gym_jane> Deele that seems to work
[01:06:42] <gym_jane> thank you
[01:07:01] <coldhead> thomedy: keep your firebug or dev tools console open and you should see it choke on those kinds of errors
[01:07:17] <thomedy> i would have to figure out how to use it let me open it
[01:07:35] <Deele> gym_jane, np ;)

[01:09:29] <coldhead> gnarf: i saw this before but i didn't understand
[01:09:35] <coldhead> bUT NOW I THINK I UNDERSTAND
[01:09:41] <gnarf> coldhead: easier to understand now? :)
[01:09:45] <scottj> if I want to post json, am I supposed to do something other than $.post("/foo", {a: true, b: "true"}) ? right now I'm getting a and b both as "true" whereas with curl and content-type set to json I get one as true adn the other as "true" as expected
[01:09:46] <coldhead> yes!
[01:10:01] <gnarf> i think im gonna decorate it up a bit and release it as a plugin
[01:10:20] <gnarf> write some ajaxy demos or something that take advantage of it
[01:10:54] <gym_jane> thanks gnarf
[01:12:18] <coldhead> shouldn't it be in core, gnarf?
[01:12:58] <gnarf> coldhead: *shrug* I think it is one of those things you only really need if you need it
[01:13:35] <coldhead> people ask for it often enough here
[01:13:53] <gym_jane> Deele and gnarf this works in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/Wfsb8/1/ but not in my text editor
[01:13:56] <coldhead> but yes, in either case, give it to the peoples
[01:14:09] <gym_jane> says syntax error on $('#g-plusone').attr('id',”).addClass('g-plusone')
[01:14:45] <gnarf> coldhead: hrm
[01:14:51] <gnarf> i was trying to define a factoid for it
[01:14:59] <gnarf> but can't think of a clever summary
[01:15:19] <matjas> gym_jane: don’t use ” when you really mean ''
[01:15:44] <coldhead> i always lean on snover and ajpiano for pithy factoids, mine are too prolix

[01:17:10] <thomedy> okay i just realized something i wentin and found firebug doesn'teven show my script.js
[01:18:34] <coldhead> jquery.newContent lets you maintain a set of callbacks ... as they are added.
[01:18:38] <munderwo> hi all, im doing an ajz call, and I have a success: function, but it doesnt seem to be firing. im getting a 200 ok back from the url... should it fire automatically?

[01:23:12] <gnarf> i used to just make one function that called a ton of other functions

[01:26:52] <thomedy> i made homemade blueberry and lavendar sorbet
[01:26:56] <thomedy> its pretty good
[01:27:03] <munderwo> im trying to workout how to use the $.ajax to use the success function... http://jsfiddle.net/mJynG/1/   any idea why this isnt working?
[01:27:07] <coldhead> oh my god
[01:27:19] <coldhead> thomedy: that is one of the most beautiful things i have heard all day
[01:27:30] <thomedy> i love to cook and i was craving something sweet
[01:27:38] <coldhead> and i spent a lot of the day watching huge waves break onto a headland
[01:27:41] <munderwo> coldhead: it would be more beautiful if they could bring it round to my house...
[01:27:49] <coldhead> hahaha yes
[01:28:06] <thomedy> its actually not that hard sorbet is just water fruit and suger
[01:28:13] <munderwo> thomedy: you dont happen to live near western australia?
[01:28:25] <thomedy> i happen to have lavendar and ivf you haave ever eaten lavender you know how good it is
[01:28:36] <thomedy> im still wearing my chefs coat
[01:29:00] <thomedy> im not a cheff but my wife knows me and bought it for me on one of our anniverearys
[01:29:04] <thomedy> crap i need a nap
[01:29:12] <thomedy> what the heck did i just type
[01:29:15] <coldhead> i prefer to believe sorbet is very hard, then i can appreciate it more when it is made for me
[01:29:25] <coldhead> also i loathe cooking
[01:29:26] <thomedy> no it is
[01:29:33] <thomedy> actually its extremely difficult
[01:29:44] <thomedy> true sorbet has to be dug from your own water source well
[01:29:47] <munderwo> i dont care how hard it is, I just want it made for me ... :)
[01:29:50] <thomedy> like in biblical isreal
[01:29:57] <thomedy> or else its just ice
[01:30:14] <munderwo> probably needs virgin blood as well
[01:30:26] <munderwo> kinda like black pudding, but sweet?
[01:30:34] <thomedy> yeah but im a dad so i had to just wing it
[01:30:51] <munderwo> not quite the right taste, but close
[01:31:04] <thomedy> i agree virgin is delicious..

[02:18:27] <thomedy> okay i have no idea why this isn'[t working
[02:22:20] <thomedy> i can do it normally
[02:22:27] <thomedy> once i add it to my code i got nothing
[02:23:02] <drwho> conflict somewhere between the api and the code
[02:23:29] <thomedy> im just going to frankly ask the question
[02:23:31] <thomedy> is this the link
[02:23:35] <thomedy> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.js
[02:23:55] <thomedy> ive done this and also googleapi
[02:27:38] <drwho> I don't use the link I just download it and put it on the local server
[02:28:02] <thomedy> i guess i can do that  thats at jquery.com correct
[02:28:10] <drwho> yes
[02:28:24] <drwho> I also have a question but don't know if anyone is around
[02:28:55] <drwho> its about how to specifiy to jQuery's $.post command when to run the successful function and when not to if possible
[02:29:07] <iivvoo> is there a simple way to get the label / text value from a <select>-ed option?
[02:29:25] <iivvoo> so not $("#foo").val()
[02:29:54] <drwho> is that not working?
[02:30:11] <drwho> or something like $("select#foo").val()
[02:30:17] <iivvoo> no, that's the value
[02:30:25] <iivvoo> I need the label / text / whatever
[02:30:33] <iivvoo> $(‘#selectList :selected’).text(); might do the trick
[02:30:37] <drwho> $("select#foo").text()
[02:30:39] <drwho> then
[02:31:31] <iivvoo> no, that will give me the entire <select>, not the selection
[02:33:49] <impi> ah mna
[02:33:55] <impi> man i cant get this right
[02:34:09] <impi> how difficult is is to find a bloody string of text :(
[02:34:25] <impi> all i wanna do is if someone types SEO in any text area, i want to alert
[02:34:31] <impi> can one even do this?
[02:34:36] <drwho> iivvoo, try $(":selected").text()
[02:34:42] <thomedy> it wasn'tanything i thought t was i just lookedat my source again.. after document.ready i left of functionto wrap stuff in
[02:34:47] <thomedy> maybe its sleep time
[02:35:03] <iivvoo> drwho, that's what I said :)
[02:35:20] <drwho> I mean just selected
[02:35:30] <drwho> not what you had before :selected
[02:35:38] <drwho> thomedy, yeah seems that time
[02:36:15] <thomedy> but im finally gettingpaid to do web work and thought it involves minimum jquery
[02:36:19] <thomedy> iwant to follow through
[02:36:31] <thomedy> plus i wnat to eventually step away frommy job
[02:36:35] <thomedy> so onward
[02:38:11] <iivvoo> drwho, I'll need to limit it to a specific <select>, of course, not just any selected item in the form
[02:42:39] <Morkel> is it possible to change an textfield to an input field?
[02:43:43] <Tant102> textElement.replaceWith(inputElement)
[02:44:05] <^zoggy^> well a text field is an input field..
[02:44:18] <^zoggy^> just depends if you are posting the contents or getting the contents
[02:44:31] <Tant102> I guess he wants inline editing of p/span.
[02:44:39] <Morkel> but you can adjust the size from an textfield
[02:45:05] <Morkel> and than you have a little sign on the right site
[02:45:21] <Morkel> Tant102: thank toyu
[02:45:26] <Morkel> you
[02:45:43] <drwho> iivvoo, try this $("select[id='foo'] option:selected").text()
[02:47:39] <iivvoo> drwho I already have my problem solved = $("#foo :selected").text() is wahat I need
[02:47:58] <drwho> ok
[02:48:06] <drwho> now to work on mine
[02:49:53] <ruby_on_tails> anyone knows some good timer ? where i set a start time and it will show time elapsed since then with the seconds changing every second ?
[02:51:46] <Diverdude> Does anybody know a good jquery plugin for dropdown dependency?
[02:52:01] <impi> can someone help me to say - if anyone types SEO in a text area then alert?
[02:55:43] <thomedy> can i do more then one div id as a selector
[02:55:47] <thomedy> im looking and i don't see
[02:55:48] <thomedy> it
[02:55:56] <AdvoWork> if im doing an ajax post, and have success: success,  how do i setup success to be a function? ive seen this code: .success(function() { alert("second success"); }) but cant get it working
[02:55:57] <thomedy> but im not sure how to select my innermost content
[02:58:06] <fealls> impi: http://jsfiddle.net/uchDp/
[02:59:14] <fealls> actually change it to keyup
[02:59:30] <impi> fealls, i would have never gotten that right, i was trying match() *:contains :(
[02:59:47] <impi> i have so much to learn still, that is apparent
[02:59:56] <impi> i can change your keydown with .change hey?
[03:00:03] <fealls> yeah
[03:00:07] <impi> or was that also one of my mistakes?
[03:00:24] <fealls> well use .keyup
[03:00:26] <ruby_on_tails> anyone ?
[03:00:45] <thomedy> dont ask me ruby im still learning selectors
[03:01:40] <fealls> impi: btw your mistake using :contains selectors is that you weren't actually binding an event to the textarea... so your selector would find a textarea that has "SEO" in it -when the page loads- which is not the case you wanted
[03:02:31] <fealls> btw, you can remove the #textbox from the selector and then it will be binded to all textareas in the document, regardless of it's id
[03:03:32] <impi> fealls, im such a dumbass,
[03:03:43] <impi> i changed that script to keyup, and it works like a charm
[03:03:52] <impi> thank you - you have saved me from insanity
[03:08:54] <thomedy> oaky its bed time...time to start getting better at jquery now
[03:09:43] <jayar> how do i use toggle() with slideup() and slidedown()
[03:10:05] <fealls> .slideToggle()
[03:10:11] <jayar> oh lol
[03:10:14] <fealls> :)
[03:10:15] * jayar slaps me
[03:27:49] <eml> Well this is annoying. My div doesn't become draggable() but resizable() works fine.
[03:29:08] <jayar> i feel ya... i obviously dunno what im doin... cuz my div is unmovable()
[03:29:26] <jayar> i cant even get the thing to slideDown()
[03:29:41] <jayar> i know im missin somethin stupid
[03:29:58] <eml> =)
[03:30:16] <eml> I add my <div> through .prepend(), maybe that's what's causing it.
[03:31:18] <eml> Anyone know anything about that?
[03:36:21] <greg_f> I need to select element that was load via ajax, how to do it?
[03:42:08] <senn_> is there any way to inject the value of a remotely load .js file into a specific container... the scenario is when an ipad/iphone is detected... due to CDN constraints we dynamically load in a html5 media player script after page load. The script loads the player and then plays a movie. Unfortunately I don't seem to have any control on the placement of this included player element.. it just gets included at the bottom of the document... how can I control/inj
[03:42:10] <senn_> ect this player into a container of my choice
[03:51:23] <Diverdude> If i have an array like this, how do i then check how many entries there is in the outer dimension? (in this cases there is 2) {"1":{"organisationsID":"1","0":"ad ","Organisation":"ad "},"2":{"organisationsID":"2","0":"CYVA Deineta ","Organisation":"CYVA Deineta "}}
[03:52:44] <pomke> I'm loading some elements from one document into another with .clone() from an iframe and .append() into the parent, and I'm wondering why CSS doesn't apply to these elements from the new document?
[03:53:28] <Diverdude> anyone?
[04:00:53] <Ely2> Hi i have a problem with a small script: http://jsfiddle.net/4KSL9/ .. when something is checked i would like to uncheck it when i click on it (images in places of checkboxes)
[04:00:57] <Ely2> but it's not working
[04:02:42] <aleray> hi, is it posible to animate background-position?
[04:04:07] <jayar> Ely2: try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1467228/click-toggle-with-jquery
[04:04:26] <AndyDawson> hello. is it correct that the dragstart event is triggered for a disabled draggable? http://ad7six.com/dump/jqueryui-draggable.png
[04:05:15] <Ely2> mm which should i pick jayar :D
[04:06:30] <Diverdude> so if i have {"1":{a:1,b:2},"2":{a:1,b:2},"3":{a:1,b:2}}  i only want 3 iterations containing {a:1,b:2}  and   {a:1,b:2}  and  {a:1,b:2}. How can that be done?
[04:08:13] <Tant102> Diverdude, $.each(data, function(itemIdx, item) { ... })
[04:08:23] <Tant102> Either that, or switch item/itemIdx.
[04:10:35] <Diverdude> Tant102, no that seems to iterate each character
[04:10:39] <jayar> whichever works Ely2 :)
[04:10:39] <Diverdude> i dont want that
[04:11:09] <Diverdude> i want to index only the rows, so that i get 3 iterations containing {a:1,b:2}  and   {a:1,b:2}  and  {a:1,b:2}
[04:12:17] <Diverdude> Tant102, ?
[04:12:46] <Tant102> Checking.
[04:16:55] <Tant102> Diverdude, I dont see the problem you're seeing.
[04:18:03] <Diverdude> Tant102, I have this code: $.each(data, function(itemIdx, item) {console.log( item + " = " + itemIdx)})
[04:18:59] <Tant102> item is the {a:...,b:...}
[04:19:07] <Tant102> http://jsfiddle.net/tApnZ/1/
[04:19:17] <Diverdude> it writes this: http://pastebin.com/XwSeDjT8
[04:19:47] <Tant102> Looks like you have a string with json, instead of an object with that value?
[04:20:08] <Diverdude> maybe that is the problem yes
[04:20:13] <Diverdude> how can that be fixed?
[04:20:19] <Anitox> parseJSON?
[04:20:29] <Anitox> ?.parseJSON
[04:20:57] <Diverdude> i did echo json_encode() on the server
[04:21:00] <Diverdude> so it should be ok
[04:21:09] <Tant102> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[04:22:43] <jayar> can i put if/else inside animate({ ?
[04:27:41] <Diverdude> THANK YOU :)
[04:30:35] <SilentPenguin> jayar, check the docs for the step property, function that can be called on each iteration, it might be useful depending on what you're doing, but i don't remember the docs ever suggesting that you can put callables in any of the other properties except for notification of when the animation has finished
[04:31:18] <NickASloan> what does everyone use for masking inputs?
[04:33:47] <albacker> why doesn't this display the slider  http://pastebin.com/MuxbDkwu
[04:34:21] <greg_f> I need to select element that was load via ajax $().load(), how to do it?
[04:34:49] <jayar> yea i was just goin through that, SilentPenguin. its not really helpin much heh. thnx tho :)
[04:36:02] <SilentPenguin> jayar, what specifically are you trying to do?
[04:39:03] <jayar> toggle animation
[04:39:29] <jayar> div comes down okay. but when i wanna toggle it to go back up, i run into probs
[04:40:44] <jayar> lol i got it :)
[04:40:59] <jayar> i knew i missin somethin stupid... forgot a }
[04:43:49] <amirite_> how can i know when window content is loaded AFTER loading, i.e. after appending a bunch of elements i want to know if the page is suitable for major work or if it'll choke because the browser isn't quite ready
[04:45:29] <xec> amirite_: if you're already appending a bunch of elements, couldnt you just do the rest of your stuff after?
[04:59:15] <freak_> hi

[05:02:16] <nwsyt> any idea?

[05:05:09] <impi> it's for my SEO spam plugin...
[05:05:11] <fatherjack> Hi. I have function called fuelCalc but how do i call it after i have clicked calculate button?
[05:05:39] <nwsyt> impi maybe a for or a while loop?
[05:05:45] <eml> fatherjack: $('#mybutton').click(function () { fuelCalc(); });
[05:05:50] <impi> nwsyt, im gonna try it thanks,
[05:05:55] <eml> ?.click
[05:06:39] <impi> hehe
[05:06:46] <nwsyt> someone knows about an "Uncaught Error: INVALID_STATE_ERR: DOM Exception 11" error on chrome?
[05:08:05] <eml> nwsyt: Canvas related?
[05:08:09] <Morkel> is it possible to refactor this? https://gist.github.com/1006238
[05:08:17] <Morkel> I think its looks not realy nice
[05:08:21] <nwsyt> eml what do you mean?
[05:08:38] <Lee_msi> does anyone know the best method/structure for developing a jquery plugin with methods so i can do $(ele).doSomething({ options }); then $(ele).doSomething('remove'); or similar
[05:08:58] <eml> nwsyt: When are you getting it? Have you googled?
[05:09:16] <fatherjack> hmm weird cant get it work
[05:09:27] <eml> fatherjack: Check the documentation @ jquery.com
[05:09:57] <nwsyt> eml: I googled and I didn't get any solution... I get this when I call a ajax function, on the success method
[05:09:59] <Diverdude> If i have a form with id="rateform" with fields such as : <input type="hidden" rateid="4" value="val"/> is it possible to search the form for a specific rateid? Somethin like $('#rateform').Find('ratid=4') ?
[05:10:06] <fatherjack> thanks i will have a look
[05:10:28] <eml> nwsyt: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2357430/invalid-state-err-dom-exception-11 so this doesn't help?
[05:10:55] <nwsyt> eml: it is not a jquery ajax call
[05:11:31] <impi> nwsyt, thanks - needed to learn that bit,
[05:12:02] <fatherjack> lol i have been calling wrong function... damn friday
[05:12:06] <eml> fatherjack: :D
[05:12:09] <eml> It's friday friday
[05:12:25] <eml> nwsyt: But you're asking in #jquery?
[05:12:47] <nwsyt> eml, this is a jquery chat, isn't it?
[05:13:02] <malibu> Hi there.  I'm thinking of using jquery for a project but I see nothing in the docs about graceful degradation.  Say I use the datepicker for a function.. would it still be functional for someone without javascript?
[05:13:19] <xec> eml: i think he meant your stackoverflow link is not about jquery
[05:13:24] <eml> Oh..
[05:13:34] <eml> My bad :(
[05:13:36] <greg_f> I load part of html via $.load('url'), how to select elements that where loaded?
[05:13:39] <kojiro> malibu: are you after WCAG 1.0?
[05:13:56] <malibu> kojiro, Don't know what that is?
[05:13:58] <nwsyt> eml hahaha
[05:14:07] <nwsyt> I posted a question on a forum
[05:14:19] <kojiro> malibu: it's the driving force behind ideas like graceful degradation
[05:14:23] <nwsyt> I hope someone answer
[05:14:38] <eml> nwsyt: gl =)
[05:15:33] <malibu> kojiro, well my driving force is that I know people who use noscript and won't use a site that needs javascript
[05:15:45] <kojiro> malibu: but it's also dated... Almost all accessibility tools support javascript to some regard or another, so standards like WAI-ARIA are being developed to create rich, responsive applications without sacrificing accessibility
[05:15:51] <kojiro> malibu: right, I use noscript :)
[05:16:18] <kojiro> malibu: the thing is, I'll come to your house and threaten your dog if I can't get to your content without javascript, but I don't care if I have to pick dates by hand ;)
[05:17:02] <malibu> kojiro, So.. does jquery still work with noscript blocking it?
[05:17:12] <kojiro> malibu: no
[05:17:58] <malibu> kojiro, ok so develop the site first without jquery and then use jquery for 'splash'
[05:18:40] <kojiro> malibu: right, progressive enhancement
[05:18:52] <amirite> jquery data method is slow
[05:18:52] <amirite> why?
[05:23:36] <Picard> Yop all
[05:24:49] <James-> hi Picard
[05:24:56] <James-> what s your problem ?
[05:24:57] <wakawaka> hi all, anyone know how to find the events attached to an element?
[05:25:22] <wakawaka> i thought it was $('#id').data('events')
[05:25:32] <wakawaka> but that doesnt seem to be working with 1.6
[05:26:09] <jayar> .fadeIn() doesnt work on videos i take it?
[05:26:24] <erichynds> works for me, wakawaka
[05:26:59] <wakawaka> erichynds: hm ok i must be doing something else wrong, thanks
[05:27:11] <erichynds> wakawaka: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/BBenW/
[05:27:23] <Picard> Why when html code is added with JQuery, the events on this kind of elements are disabled ?
[05:28:08] <erichynds> Picard: sounds like you need to bind events with live() or delegate()
[05:28:33] <Picard> I'm gonna read the doc about that, it's maybe the solution
[05:29:21] <readysteadygo> can anyone tell me why jqueryui is not being included properly?
[05:29:22] <readysteadygo> http://gregwoodward.co.uk/woodwrack/
[05:30:27] <erichynds> readysteadygo: follow this link, you get a web page instead of jquery: http://gregwoodward.co.uk/woodwrack/jquery/js/jquery-1.4.4.min.js
[05:30:55] <imanc> what does this do: (function($) { ?
[05:31:29] <wakawaka> erichynds: thanks, i just did the same thing, i wonder if .data('events') works with listeners added through .delegate, trying...
[05:31:32] <greg_f> erichynds: But if I use load() to get part of html, how to delegate() this event?
[05:31:33] <readysteadygo> yes wrong version sorry
[05:31:45] <readysteadygo> erichynds: ty
[05:32:29] <erichynds> greg_f, are there events bound to elements in the html loaded via ajax?
[05:32:44] <erichynds> you wouldn't delegate .load()
[05:33:29] <readysteadygo> erichynds: it still doesn't seem to be including something properly
[05:33:40] <readysteadygo> http://jsfiddle.net/FcBhv/30/
[05:33:57] <readysteadygo> this works fine and it's exactly the same code, i just am including something wrong?
[05:34:12] <wakawaka> erichynds: .data('events') works fine in fiddle with delegate, just a matter of figuring out why i cant get the events in my app
[05:34:45] <erichynds> readysteadygo: you weren't including jquery correctly.. do you use firebug or webkit inspector? you can see the errors thrown in there.
[05:36:07] <greg_f> erichynds: thanks, but how to select elements that where loaded via ajax with load()?
[05:36:25] <Diverdude> if i add a hidden field to a form called 'ratingForm' like this: $('#ratingForm').add('<input name="vote'+data.id+'" id="vote'+data.id+'" type="hidden" value="'+data.id+'_'+data.rate+'">');  the fields should be submitted to the server when submit has been pressed right?
[05:36:29] <erichynds> greg_f are you trying to select them or bind events to them?
[05:36:44] <greg_f> select them
[05:36:50] <readysteadygo> erichynds: i have firebug installed, where can i see the errors?
[05:37:16] <erichynds> greg_f in the success callback of .load().  .load("url", function(){ /* select elements */ });
[05:37:22] <erichynds> readysteadygo the console
[05:37:46] <greg_f> readysteadygo: click on the bug in right corne of ff
[05:37:55] <erichynds> readysteadygo http://erichynds.com/i/09bd5d.png
[05:38:20] <Diverdude> any1?
[05:38:28] <jayar> how do i wait till fadeOut() ends, and then go?
[05:38:40] <readysteadygo> oh thank you, it was disabled
[05:38:57] <erichynds> i'm out. bye guiz!
[05:38:58] <Klevre> How do I animate 1 or more elements at the same time?
[05:38:59] <greg_f> erichynds: you're genius! thanks
[05:43:19] <Diverdude> if i add a hidden field to a form with id='ratingForm' and i want to add hidden fields like this: $('#ratingForm').add('<input name="vote'+data.id+'" id="vote'+data.id+'" type="hidden" value="'+data.id+'_'+data.rate+'">');  the fields should be submitted to the server when submit has been pressed right? The problem is they dont get submitted to the server. AM I missing something?
[05:46:26] <wakawaka> hi all, anyone have any ideas as to why .data('events') would not work with .delegate?
[05:46:58] <wakawaka> i coded it up here http://jsfiddle.net/MVafc/1/ the alert works but the console reads undefined for the .data('events')
[05:47:49] <Diverdude> can anybody help me?
[05:48:15] <wakawaka> Diverdude: try append
[05:51:25] <wakawaka> Diverdude: any luck?

[06:00:28] <sunscreen>  firefox is the king again!
[06:00:36] <impi> Klevre, .siblings
[06:00:50] <impi> or maybe .children
[06:00:54] <impi> sorry im still a n00b
[06:01:08] <Klevre> So iterate through all of them?
[06:01:44] <impi> well maybe $('#myparent').children() {}
[06:04:15] <LYoung> This isn't switching content >>> http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/3mJqY/

[06:08:27] <JAAulde> In looking at the docs for jQuery UI's dialog, I don't see the bgiframe option listed anymore. Has the need for this option and the associated plugin gone away?
[06:15:40] <poijn> Is there a reason why I cant use ele.insertAfter( ele2 ) but ele.parent().append( ele2 )?

[06:18:58] <LYoung> http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/3mJqY/           <<< thats supposed to be swapping content on the page, but it isn't... All that happns is that the title changes
[06:19:45] <Picard> Just another question, when i use size or lenght with <tr> elements of my table I have twice more than the numbers of lines, why ?
[06:20:23] <LYoung> Are you taking margin/padding into account?
[06:20:37] <Picard> Omg, I'm dumb... That's fine, I know what's the problem x)
[06:21:09] <Klevre> impi: CSS3 Transform Scale was just what I needed
[06:23:15] <cfurrow2> LYoung, http://jsfiddle.net/cfurrow/3mJqY/2/
[06:23:50] <cfurrow2> LYoung, you contentPanes selector was incorrect. You were missing a space.
[06:24:17] <LYoung> whats the space for?
[06:25:34] <cfurrow> Your old query: contentPanes = $("div.PriceList.sections > div") The new query: contentPanes = $("div.PriceList .sections > div")
[06:25:46] <cfurrow> The space between .PriceList and .sections needed to be there
[06:25:55] <Rotham> hey
[06:26:16] <Rotham> is there a way to use firebug to see exactly what functions are being called when I mouse over items on the page?
[06:26:30] <Rotham> or to see any functions that are attached to hover/click events?
[06:26:43] <cfurrow> LYoung, In your original query, you were looking for a div that had css classes PriceList AND sections. But what you really wanted was a div with css class PriceList and find all sub elements that had a css class of .sections
[06:26:52] <cfurrow> LYoung: Does that make sense?
[06:27:05] <LYoung> ah, yeah thanks :)
[06:27:32] <cfurrow> Rotham, you can do a profile
[06:27:46] <Rotham> ah cool thanks.
[06:30:12] <lazfsh> Hey noob here.  I am using JQM and I know it has a lot of references to AJAX but is there a way to have it check eveynow and then and update the content without refresh? Maybe I am missing something. I would like to have it always check so I don't have to ever hit my refresh button.
[06:31:59] <cfurrow> lazfsh, You could use javascript's setInterval(function(){ code that checks for updates here, and grabs new stuff if needed},10000); It would check every 10 seconds for new code, and update. Just fill in the blanks
[06:58:45] <aidan> If I have a slider, with a youtube video in the second slider, what do I need to call to make the <object> happy? At the moment it doesn't show ..
[06:59:55] <markj> obviously this is a jquery channel so the replies might be biased but has anyone had any experience with the 'mobile' frameworks like jq mobile / dojo mobile/ sencha mobile? not sure what way to go at the moment
[07:00:50] <orolo> ajpiano; what is the documentation project you are working on for jQuery?
[07:01:04] <orolo> is it the fundamentals site?
[07:01:42] <lobaman> hi, if i have a list with a link inside. how can i get the .next() <a> link?
[07:02:28] <lobaman> ive tried this. $active = $(".vid-nav li a.active").next('.vid-nav li a'); doesnt work.
[07:04:47] <atula> lobaman: next().find('a') perhaps
[07:06:00] <systemfault> .parent().next().find('a') perhaps
[07:06:10] <cfurrow> lobaman, I think your syntax is incorrect, because it's trying to find the next "a.active" inside your current li
[07:06:26] <cfurrow> lobaman, I think systemfault is right, something like that would work and be more correct.
[07:06:42] <phunky> Yep, he's right
[07:06:42] <phunky> http://jsfiddle.net/Phunky/SVdUh/
[07:07:11] <lobaman> let me try that
[07:08:51] <JAAulde> In looking at the docs for jQuery UI's dialog, I don't see the bgiframe option listed anymore. Has the need for this option and the associated plugin gone away?
[07:09:25] <Michael> Does $.data() work in IE7?
[07:09:35] <Michael> and IE8
[07:09:57] <JAAulde> Michael: AFAIK, yes...it better
[07:10:04] <Michael> one would hope :D
[07:14:47] <ajpiano> orolo: it's going to be more than the fundamentals bug

[07:15:24] <djQuery> anyone got a better way of adding an icon to a dialogs buttons?  http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/FN7KU/1/
[07:16:03] <lobaman> oh man im confuse
[07:19:39] <ikarus2k> .val()

[07:20:30] <lobaman> thanks alot everyone
[07:23:02] <systemfault> djQuery: You did it, no?

[07:40:54] <Rotham> hey.. Im trying to mod a theme to have a second menu.. I changed the ID's and copied the functions that attached the hover events to the menu, but I think im missing something.  the styles seem to ahve attached, and the hover does trigger for the second menu, but the submenus dont drop down
[07:41:01] <Rotham> heres the relevant js: http://pastebin.com/P1drTiNY
[07:41:33] <Rotham> I suck with all things js in general, and any advice on how to fix this woudl be greatly appreciated :P
[07:43:17] <arminrosu> wow, why don't you overwrite stylings in CSS?
[07:45:05] <Phoenixz> I have some logics problem with a slide down animation.. I have <div><img></div>.. Upon div.mouseenter, the image uses animate() to slide down.. on div.mouseout, the image slides up again. .Now, when I move the mouse in the div, the mouseout is fired, even though the mouse is still hovering over the div, so I tried mouseover, which gets fired whenever the mouse moves a little over the div, causing the slide down animation to stutter...
[07:45:29] <arminrosu> @Rotham: run your code through http://www.jslint.com/ ;  you have errors ...
[07:45:32] <Phoenixz> Now, is there a way, maybe, to detect if a certain animation is already running? If so I could build in a detectino and skip restarting the animation..
[07:46:01] <lobaman> what would be the cause of a method being called automatically?
[07:46:20] <ajpiano> Phoenixz $("#foo").is(":animated");
[07:46:22] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: user stop(); stops any animation ;)
[07:46:36] <ajpiano> ?fix hover @ Phoenixz
[07:46:38] <bot-t> Phoenixz, The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[07:46:38] <arminrosu> http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[07:47:21] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: Yeah, I already use that to fix the problem with mousein / mouseout where the mouseout would try to animate up while the mouseover is still trying to animate down.. But even so, I keep getting multiple mouseover events, causing the stutter..
[07:47:22] <Rotham> arminrosu: thats awesome
[07:47:27] <Rotham> thanks for that site
[07:47:47] <arminrosu> @Rotham: my pleasure :)
[07:47:55] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Will try hover, thanks!
[07:48:04] <magistr> How to realize autoscroll?
[07:48:13] <magistr> var spos = $('#set .sid'+id).scrollTop();
[07:48:19] <magistr> $('#set).ScrollTop(spos);
[07:48:33] <magistr> it is right?
[07:48:57] <magistr> $('#set')
[07:48:58] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: hmmmm, I might have had a similar problem in the past. the isse was that child elements also trigerred mouseover (there is an example in the docs, on the diff between mouseenter and hover)
[07:49:31] <arminrosu> so the solution for me was setting the selector on the lowest child
[07:50:17] <arminrosu> @magistr: first example is wrong, you need a space after '.sid'
[07:50:30] <arminrosu> like $('#set .sid '+id).scrollTop();
[07:50:43] <arminrosu> and it does the scroll, so why store it in a var?
[07:50:43] <Oli``> I'm using a $(..).load(url); construct to update a chat box and send messages. If there's an error, the server will send a redirect. Can I intercept this redirect in my .load(..) code so I can redirect the browser (instead of jQ following the redirect and loading the wrong content into the chat box)?
[07:51:38] <jeffsmykil> So I'm getting this troubling error message in IE 7:  SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'indexOf'
[07:53:11] <arminrosu> @Oli: don't think so, it's a simple GET request
[07:53:14] <lobaman> my bind(''click'') is automatically run. why? http://jsfiddle.net/Tb543/
[07:53:22] <arminrosu> you'd need to parse the result
[07:54:53] <arminrosu> @jeffsmykil: hmm, really weird. IE7 only? what does console.dir say in FF/Chrome ?
[07:55:16] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: it works in FF
[07:55:33] <jeffsmykil> and even IE 9
[07:55:41] <arminrosu> try a console.dir( Object ) on it
[07:55:45] <arminrosu> might reveal something
[07:55:46] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: I think hover() would do for what I need, BUT... Im adding these elements on the fly, and so far I used $('.class').live('mouseenter', function(){})... However, hover() has 2 functions, one for in and another for out.. How would I apply this with hover() ?
[07:56:06] <jeffsmykil> arminorsu I'm not sure what that means/ how to do that
[07:56:37] <jeffsmykil> oh to find out what it is
[07:56:39] <jeffsmykil> gotcha
[07:56:53] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: $('#target').hover( function() { this.slideDown(); }, function() { this.slideUp})
[07:56:58] <arminrosu> ^ simpified
[07:57:33] <arminrosu> @jeffsmykil: ;)
[07:57:51] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: There are no child objects
[07:57:55] <jeffsmykil> wtf?
[07:58:08] <jeffsmykil> the array starts out empty
[07:58:12] <jeffsmykil> could that be the problem?
[07:58:12] <arminrosu> are you sure its a JQ object?
[07:58:36] <arminrosu> wait, it's an array your parsing?
[07:58:38] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: Yeah, that will work for when the <div> is already there.. But now, I'll add a clone of that div, and that hover won't work for that new one.. Thats why I'm using live().. But so far ,I used live('mouseenter', function(){}).. How would I do live('hover') ? hover has 2 functions (hoverin, hoverout) whereas mouseenter only had one..
[07:58:45] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: yes
[07:58:53] <jeffsmykil> getting the index of an array
[08:00:04] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: cloning shouldn't be a problem unless you have identical ids; that relly bumps out jquery
[08:00:33] <arminrosu> I suggested you use the slideDown/SlideUp animatios for the 2 hover functions
[08:00:50] <arminrosu> they are there for hoverin / hoverout functions
[08:01:19] <Lee_msi> does anyone know the best method/structure for developing a jquery plugin with methods so i can do $(ele).doSomething({ options }); then $(ele).doSomething('remove'); or similar
[08:02:05] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: All id's are unique, and Im selecting on class, not on ID... Even so, $('.classname').mouseenter(function(){}) would only work on the already existing <div>... if I added a new one, they would not fire.. so I switched to $('.classname').live('mouseenter', function(){}) which would also take new elements.. So my question is.. will hover also bind newly created elements? if not, Id have to do soemthign like $('.classname').live('hover',
[08:02:06] <Phoenixz> function(){})
[08:02:19] <jeffsmykil> aha IE 7 doesnt support indexOf arminrosu
[08:02:21] <jeffsmykil> lol
[08:02:27] <arminrosu> just read the same
[08:02:31] <arminrosu> heres a solution:
[08:02:32] <arminrosu> http://soledadpenades.com/2007/05/17/arrayindexof-in-internet-explorer/
[08:02:51] <arminrosu> oh geesh; no wonder Google dropped IE7 support :))
[08:03:05] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: http://www.robsearles.com/2010/03/11/ie-7-indexof-replacement/
[08:03:34] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: Just tried it, and hover() has the same problem as mouseenter(), it won't be bound to new elements.. so either I bind every element when adding it (cumbersome) or I'd use soemthign like live(), but then how do I implement the 2 functions?
[08:03:51] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: nope, you'll have to use live
[08:03:55] <arminrosu> let me check something
[08:05:06] <arminrosu> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[08:05:26] <arminrosu> is basically mousente/mouseleave
[08:05:27] <Rotham> hey... is it possible to trigger the hover state on a dom object programatically for testing even if my mouse is moving other places?
[08:05:52] <arminrosu> meaning you can use:
[08:05:52] <arminrosu> http://api.jquery.com/live/#multiple-events
[08:06:08] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: Thast what I said, I'm using live()...  And there I have the problem with mouseenter or mouseover, being fired multiple times while the mouse is moving over the element, causing the animation to stutter...
[08:06:17] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: I wonder if inArray returns -1
[08:06:18] <csaunders> Has anyone had issues with the flickering that happens when switching pages on jquery mobile? If so, what are some of the ways you've fixed it?
[08:06:41] <Rotham> thanks
[08:07:24] <djQuery> systemfault: yes I did it but its kinda cludgy in my opinion
[08:07:43] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: mouseenter & mouseleave, right?
[08:08:17] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: mouseoverwill screw you (example at bottom of .live() documentation)
[08:08:17] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: jqury does seem to return -1
[08:09:04] <arminrosu> @jeffsmykil: isn't that for no result?!
[08:09:24] <jeffsmykil> arminrosu: yeah which is the result i wanted
[08:10:08] <arminrosu> @jeffsmkil: lol
[08:10:39] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: got some code to show; this here/there is getting tiresome
[08:15:50] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: I'll try to get some basic example on jsfiddle
[08:15:59] <cesconix> $('.accordion').children('h1').not(':has(+ .accordion-current)').live('click', function() {}); <---- why with '.live' i get an error 'regular expression too complex' ????
[08:19:37] <cesconix> http://jsfiddle.net/Pyjgh/1/
[08:22:05] <fealls> wth is .not(':has(+.accordion-current)') ?
[08:22:17] <fealls> .not('.accordion-current')...
[08:22:18] <djQuery> cesconix: not sure but  think this is more what u wanted. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Pyjgh/2/
[08:22:37] <djQuery> or you could use see ?.ui.accordion
[08:22:38] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[08:22:47] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: There you go: http://jsfiddle.net/GbTgS/1/
[08:23:04] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: situation right now is that when moving the mouse, the slide down animation will stutter..
[08:23:12] <amirite> jquery's .data method is excruciatingly slow when used to access data that is set via html5 data-* attributes
[08:23:14] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: so I could use hover(), in theory, to fix that...
[08:23:15] <amirite> why
[08:23:41] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: problem is that (I'll add that part now), when clicking on the image, a clone of this very object will appear right next to it, and it won't slide down..
[08:24:00] <cesconix> fealls, no
[08:24:11] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: because hover() won't be bound .. sooo.. I could use live() as I do right now, but how do I implement 'hover' in live() ?
[08:24:28] <cesconix> .not(':has(+.accordion-current)') is for get adiacent element
[08:24:41] <djQuery> Phoenixz: no stutter on chrome looks fine to me
[08:24:50] <cesconix> 'click' ok, but 'live' no
[08:25:12] <toxz> can i select an element with a specific value  - <input value="xyz" />   ?
[08:25:21] <janthony> I have a variable that is defined inside of a .click() function and I want to use it outside/after the click function. How would I do that?
[08:25:40] <fealls> toxz: $("input[value='xyz']")
[08:25:49] <toxz> thx
[08:26:05] <Phoenixz> djQuery: Im on chrome (11.0.696.71 (86024) Ubuntu 10.10) and stutter will happen if mouse moves during slide down animation
[08:26:30] <janthony> http://pastie.org/2014146 - my console.log is loging the original value of currentIndex vs the changed value from the .click() function
[08:26:32] <fealls> janthony: define it out of the .click first.
[08:26:35] <Phoenixz> djQuery: The stutter is caused by multiple mouseover (or also mouseenter, tried it) being fired while the mouse moves..
[08:26:49] <janthony> fealls: I did. :) I just pasted a pastie as well.
[08:26:57] <djQuery> Phoenixz: Chrome 13 here.
[08:27:18] <toxz> fealls - can i combine this somehow? #flighttables input:radio[name=outboundFare][value=xyz]
[08:27:23] <ajpiano> Phoenixz, you have to use a debouncing technique like i linked
[08:27:27] <fealls> toxz: yep
[08:27:31] <Phoenixz> djQuery: Chrome 13 does not fire multiple mouseover events when the mouse moves? because in that case, I'm stuck with a chrome bug, right?
[08:27:42] <toxz> fealls - in the way i did it
[08:27:43] <toxz> ?
[08:28:04] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Checked your links, I found a plugin I'd have to use.. I just wanted to see if I can do it without an extra plugin
[08:28:07] <fealls> not sure about the [type=radio], I don't know if :radio is available.
[08:28:23] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: you can use a timeout manually yourself, have fun rolling that :p
[08:28:30] <fealls> I mean I know you can use [type=radio], but if :radio is available then yes...
[08:28:40] <djQuery> fealls: see ?:radio
[08:28:40] <bot-t> fealls, :radio: Selects all elements of type radio. http://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/
[08:28:48] <fealls> then yes :P
[08:28:54] <toxz> :-)
[08:28:57] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: iow.. Use the plugin.. :)
[08:29:51] <ajpiano> Phoenixz: right now you can either do live("hover", fn) and check the event.type inside of the handler
[08:30:00] <ajpiano> or use delegate with two separate calls
[08:30:22] <janthony> Any ideas?
[08:30:25] <fealls> janthony: obviously, about your pastie - the console.log happens before the click.
[08:30:38] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: I'll try to fiddle a bit more with hover and event.type (thats  what I was looking for).. if that fixes it, I'll be done.. if not, I'll use the plugin
[08:30:44] <ajpiano> janthony, you should create the variable outside of the nested function scope and then update it from withinthe handler
[08:30:49] <ajpiano> Phoenixz, well, what are you trying to fix
[08:30:53] <fealls> you are binding the event at the .click(), and the console.log happens before you are actually clicking...
[08:31:14] <janthony> fealls: ahh I see.
[08:32:37] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: at least from what I see with console.log, I think the live("hover", fn) with event.type solves my problem! Thanks!
[08:32:42] <ajpiano> cool
[08:33:27] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: does this stutter too:
[08:33:29] <arminrosu> http://jsfiddle.net/GbTgS/2/ ?

[08:34:40] <nbari> hi all, how to replace the text that inside this '	<div id="dialog-confirm" class="hidden"><p><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-alert"></span>CHANGE</p></div>
[08:35:21] <nbari> i am using something like $('#dialog-confirm > p  > span').text('test) but that adds test to the span tag
[08:35:33] <csaunders> nbari: I've done it by adding an id to the span
[08:35:50] <csaunders> nbari: you want to change the CHANGE text?
[08:35:54] <nbari> right
[08:35:57] <csaunders> you will probably need to span that guy too
[08:35:57] <arminrosu> @nbari: it's correct that way; you'll need to add the span html to the text you're trying to add
[08:36:00] <csaunders> he's not spanned
[08:36:18] <nbari> but the Change is not spaned
[08:36:32] <nbari> the span is just for showing an small icon from the jquery-ui dialog
[08:36:37] <quicksilver> nbari: the easiest thing to to is to span the CHANGE
[08:36:39] <csaunders> you have no control over that?
[08:36:49] <quicksilver> nbari: jquery is clumsy at altering text nodes
[08:36:59] <csaunders> nbari: yeah, what quicksilver said is the easiest way to fix the problem
[08:37:15] <nbari> ok , to add <span>CHANGE</span> ?
[08:37:16] <nbari> right ?
[08:37:29] <quicksilver> proabbly give it a class so you can select it conveniently
[08:37:30] <quicksilver> but, yes.
[08:37:35] <Phoenixz> $().scroll() will bind a scroll event, but how can I make the selector scroll down from jQuery?
[08:37:59] <arminrosu> @Phoenixz: you mean the window scroll down to a selector?
[08:38:02] <nbari> ok
[08:38:16] <csaunders> essentially, I have something where it's like <a href="#" data-role="button"><span class="editOrSave">Edit</span></a> and I just do $('.editOrSave').text('Save')
[08:38:25] <ajpiano> janthony: you're just logging the currentIndex after you set up the click handler, not after an acutal click
[08:38:59] <janthony> ajpiano: yeah, got it! thanks.
[08:39:02] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: actually, I want the div to scroll down (to 100% is okay for me)
[08:39:23] <arminrosu> slide down?
[08:39:31] <nbari> mm doing now $('#dialog-confirm > p > span') I get the array or the 2 span, how to select the second ?
[08:39:47] <arminrosu> like .animate({top: '100%'})?!
[08:39:51] <magistr> ScrollDown exists?
[08:40:01] <arminrosu> no
[08:40:07] <nbari> I want to avoid ading and id (just for learning)
[08:40:11] <csaunders> nbari: [1]
[08:40:39] <csaunders> nbari: I guess... it's just kinda gross since if anything ever changes where you have more spans your code may break
[08:40:45] <ch3mical> nbari: maybe see ?nth
[08:40:48] <Phoenixz> arminrosu: ah, move the content... ?
[08:40:59] <ch3mical> Damn you, bot-t
[08:41:02] <ch3mical> Slacker
[08:41:04] <arminrosu> isn't that what you're trying to do?
[08:41:20] <jeffsmykil> So I'm comparing two javascript Date Objects and it thinks that a date in May is greater than a date in June
[08:41:27] <nbari> $('#dialog-confirm > p > span')[1].text('test); did not work
[08:41:54] <nbari> ? nth
[08:42:05] <jeffsmykil> it must go by the date
[08:42:52] <nbari> all this is because I cant to change the text displayied on a dialog box , if I got a 'false' I want to change the text, otherwise just reload the page
[08:43:04] <ch3mical> nbari: sorry, it's eq()
[08:43:29] <ch3mical> $('#dialog-confirm > p > span:eq(1)').text('test');
[08:43:39] <nbari> ok
[08:43:56] <nbari> that worked, thanks
[08:44:02] <mdunham918> I cannot get $('area').live('click',function(){ alert('test'); }); to work on the iPad?
[08:44:10] <mdunham918> everythign else works just not the area
[08:44:19] <mdunham918> can i not do live click on an area element?
[08:45:04] <ccmonster> in a ul that is nested to make a multi level menu, how do I grab just the id of the item I've selected? I ask because if i do $(this).attr('id") it returns the parent id, and the submenu's id twice. it's odd. If i click on a top level item in the menu, it works fine. Just sub menu's cause problems
[08:45:07] <jeffsmykil> am i comparing dates wrong?
[08:45:08] <jeffsmykil> if (pageDate.getDate() > yesterday.getDate()) {
[08:46:09] <csaunders> I have a mobile app that seems to sort of flicker when I change pages, it only happens on mobile devices.
[08:47:03] <csaunders> When you change a page in jqMobile, it remembers where you are and silent scrolls to that point in the page, yes?  Which may be what is causing some of the flickering?
[08:47:05] <jeffsmykil> yeah getTime works much better
[08:47:09] <csaunders> gs
[08:59:38] <ariston^> need help gurus, can somebody tell me why jquery can't see this part npbuynow_1 element with this code jQuery("#npbuynow1").colorbox({width:"400px", height:"290px", iframe:true, scrolling:false});
[09:00:20] <ariston^> #npbuynow1 is just <a id="npbuynow_1">
[09:00:46] <ajpiano> ariston^, so if you had a div with the id of "foo", would you expect that "f0o" would select it?
[09:01:08] <ajpiano> or would you expect that since you used a different string than its actual ID, it wouldn't work
[09:01:09] <ajpiano> ;)
[09:01:41] <arminrosu> @all: cheerio
[09:01:55] <ariston^> @ajpiano what's the best thing to do?
[09:02:04] <ajpiano> uh, use the element's id?
[09:02:18] <ajpiano> $("#npbuynow_1")
[09:04:43] <mrmagoo1982> hi peeps
[09:05:05] <ariston^> thanks
[09:06:05] <mrmagoo1982> i have some html returned in a response '<a href="http://www.website.co.uk">some text</a>  and I would like to get the href value from it but i just get undefined.  I tried fileurl = jQuery('a',html).attr('href');
[09:06:31] <ariston^> @ajpiano tried jQuery($("#npbuynow_1")).colorbox({width:"400px", height:"290px", iframe:true, scrolling:false}); still doesn't work
[09:07:06] <ryanneufeld> ariston^: doesn't understand how to use jquery....
[09:07:18] <mipo> mrmagoo1982 : $("a").attr('href');
[09:07:21] <ryanneufeld> $("#npbuynow_1").colorbox({width:"400px", height:"290px", iframe:true, scrolling:false});
[09:07:27] <ryanneufeld> try that
[09:07:28] <yanick> hi, is it possible to pass some data to a JQuery Dialog close ('dialogclose') event like for a (for example) a DOMElement click event?
[09:08:25] <mrmagoo1982> how do i access that when the content i'm searching is in the variable html,  i.e. function(html){ var fileurl = jQuery('a',html).attr('href');}
[09:08:31] <ariston^> @ryanneufeld error
[09:08:51] <ariston^> no colorbox function when i use that
[09:09:00] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:09:04] <ryanneufeld> must be using no conflict then
[09:09:18] <ryanneufeld> try:  jQuery("#npbuynow_1").colorbox({width:"400px", height:"290px", iframe:true, scrolling:false});
[09:09:30] <sphinxxx> what's the easiest way to download an entire site?
[09:09:31] <ariston^> i use jQuery(element).colorbox()
[09:09:45] <ryanneufeld> sphinxxx: wget -r
[09:09:55] <sphinxxx> i'm on windows
[09:10:08] <ryanneufeld> sphinxxx: that changes nothing
[09:10:12] <ryanneufeld> cygwin
[09:10:21] <sphinxxx> oh ok
[09:10:23] <ryanneufeld> or upgrade to Ubuntu :p
[09:10:24] <sphinxxx> i'd prefer a gui though
[09:10:31] <ariston^> @rtanneufeld tried that also
[09:10:48] <Phoenixz> sphinxxx: If Im not mistaken, Ubuntu has a GUI :)
[09:10:59] <ryanneufeld> sphinxxx: this is not the place to ask that kind of a question, this is a jquery related channel
[09:11:20] <ajpiano> ariston^, you have to check if your selector is actually matching any elements
[09:11:28] <ajpiano> $("#foo").length
[09:12:22] <ariston^> hmm
[09:15:42] <newbie007> I'm getting a strange result which is making me question if $.map is working asynchronously -- there is no chance of that of that ... right?
[09:16:02] <rizwan> Hi i need some information, is anyone there?
[09:16:11] <newbie007> I'm here
[09:16:49] <rizwan> great, I am new to JQuery, i just want to know is it possible to inject javascript code into my local webpage using JQuery.
[09:17:14] <newbie007> inject?
[09:17:20] <rizwan> i am making a C++ application which has to modify HTML DOM in real time of a local generated HTML page in browser
[09:17:39] <rizwan> just like through JS console we can do things like <document.title = "new titile">
[09:17:51] <rizwan> similarly i want to call such functions from my external app
[09:18:03] <ryanneufeld> ?.getScript @ rizwan
[09:18:03] <bot-t> rizwan, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[09:18:04] <rizwan> is there anyway JQuery can help me realize this situation?
[09:19:02] <ariston^> weird i can alert html element
[09:19:09] <rizwan> anybody?
[09:19:38] <ariston^> alrady made changes on ids so there's no conlict any other reason for that?

[09:20:45] <rizwan> i hope it helps
[09:20:48] <ariston^> btw im using ajax call .. this is driving me nuts
[09:21:10] <amid_hasan> are you calling a remote service ariston^?
[09:21:22] <ariston^> no
[09:21:29] <ryanneufeld> ?p ariston^
[09:21:29] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:21:42] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @ariston^
[09:21:42] <bot-t> ariston^, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[09:21:45] <smallfoot-> so i have a table with 10 rows, then i click on the row, and its in $(this), but how do i get the 3rd column of $(this) row ?
[09:22:17] <smallfoot-> i mean, the content between <td> <and </td> on that column
[09:22:19] <ariston^> hold on
[09:22:38] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: $(this).find('td').splice(2,1).html(); might work
[09:22:45] <smallfoot-> oh
[09:22:53] <magistr> $("#box p:last").scrollTop = $("#box p:last").scrollHeight;
[09:23:13] <magistr> doesn't work
[09:24:23] <Michael> Is scrollTop readonly?
[09:24:25] <smallfoot-> $(this).find("td").splice(2, 1).html is not a function
[09:24:41] <ryanneufeld> what is $(this) ?
[09:24:43] <Michael> I believe scrollTop and scrollLeft are readonly
[09:24:46] <ryanneufeld> console.log it
[09:24:51] <ryanneufeld> Michael: is right
[09:25:03] <smallfoot-> how to console log?
[09:25:19] <Michael> console.log($(this));
[09:25:21] <ryanneufeld> console.log($(this)); put that in your code
[09:25:24] <Michael> sorry
[09:25:27] <smallfoot-> ok thakns
[09:25:30] <ryanneufeld> then open the javascript console
[09:25:32] <ryanneufeld> and see
[09:25:38] <ryanneufeld> do you have firebug?
[09:25:41] <ryanneufeld> if not
[09:25:42] <ryanneufeld> get it
[09:25:45] <ryanneufeld> learn it
[09:25:46] <ryanneufeld> love it
[09:25:48] <smallfoot-> [18:25:39.082] ({0:#1=({}), context:#1#, length:1})
[09:25:59] <smallfoot-> dont think firebug works in firefox4
[09:26:01] <DukeDrake> smallfoot-: it's $(this).find("td").splice(2, 1).html() <-- don't fdorget the brackets
[09:26:25] <csaunders> inspector in chrome/webkit/safari is good too
[09:26:28] <newbie007> firebug really changed the game
[09:26:29] <ariston^> http://jsfiddle.net/HQUML/
[09:26:52] <smallfoot-> its the javascript console that prints it without brackets
[09:26:52] <csaunders> cmd+alt+i on mac...
[09:26:58] <ariston^> this is the part cant see  <a style="display: none;" class="bdark" id="npbuynow_1" href="/index.php?main_page=product_buy&amp;cPath=1_2&amp;products_id=1">Buy Now</a>
[09:27:33] <smallfoot-> ryanneufeld, i console logged it now, it only say: ({0:#1=({}), context:#1#, length:1})
[09:28:01] <ryanneufeld> that's weird
[09:28:27] <phentges> In container with id #foo, I have several objects with class .bar. What's the best way to find the one of .bar that also lacks class .baz?
[09:28:45] <magistr> scrollIntoView() also not work, Jquery isn't able to work with DOM, thanks.
[09:30:33] <ariston^> but if i alert it displays right
[09:33:11] <mipo> how to select a record of table ? similar thunderbird!
[09:33:20] <innociv_> How do I see if a user is behind a firewall and using an old version of websockets that causes problems with it?..
[09:33:52] <smallfoot-> alert($(this).find("td").text()); prints the content of all <td> in one string
[09:34:00] <smallfoot-> but i want the content of just one td
[09:35:01] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: try $(this).find("td").get(2) and see what it returns
[09:35:45] <smallfoot-> it says '[object HTMLTableCellElement]'
[09:36:23] <ariston^> @ryanneufeld can you take a look man?
[09:36:33] <ryanneufeld> ariston^: I did
[09:36:42] <ariston^> oh oki
[09:37:04] <ryanneufeld> but I don't have time to figure out where your JS is
[09:37:19] <ryanneufeld> the point of jsfiddle is that you can put your js/css/html in the appropriate boxes
[09:37:34] <ryanneufeld> get that setup
[09:37:41] <ryanneufeld> and I'll try and take another look
[09:38:39] <ariston^> alright
[09:40:18] <ariston^> http://jsfiddle.net/v7Qyk/
[09:41:12] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2014443 - how do I correctly pass in something to overwrite the external_search_url value?
[09:41:47] <ryanneufeld> ariston^: you're getting there
[09:41:51] <ryanneufeld> now, on the left
[09:41:58] <ryanneufeld> make sure you have the right files included
[09:41:58] <ccmonster> searcher.init({external_search_url:'http://mynewsearch.html'}); ?
[09:44:28] <anoob> blur happens when an element lose the focus (on click or tab)... how do i get the next element that will get the focus?
[09:44:38] <anoob> within onblur
[09:45:07] <ccmonster> the next element? like if you tab?
[09:47:03] <ccmonster> you can do the .next() but that will only work if the items are in order
[09:47:03] <newbie007> anoob: you can set it, but I don't think you can easily get it, well unless you set the tabbing for everything
[09:47:22] <fealls> phentges: $("#foo .bar:not('.baz')")
[09:47:32] <ccmonster> yea, you could possibly extract the tab index of the site some how, then check current focus against index and then grab the next item
[09:47:34] <ariston^> not sure what to put left
[09:47:47] <anoob> newbie007 but what happens with clicked items?
[09:47:58] <ccmonster> :focusable
[09:48:00] <ccmonster> or something
[09:48:04] <ccmonster> what you mean anoob
[09:48:07] <ryanneufeld> ariston^: you can choose which libraries to include
[09:48:10] <ccmonster> they gain focus
[09:48:21] <ryanneufeld> ariston^: it can't read your mind and know what files you need
[09:48:35] <ryanneufeld> ?.focus() @ anoob
[09:48:36] <bot-t> anoob, .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[09:48:58] <ryanneufeld> anoob: use that to bind to the onfocus event on the elments
[09:49:11] <ryanneufeld> create a function that will do your stuff when the elements get focused
[09:49:11] <anoob> i need to get it inside of onblur
[09:49:17] <ryanneufeld> anoob: why?
[09:49:20] <ccmonster> why inside of onblur?
[09:50:09] <anoob> https://examples.wufoo.com/forms/employment-application/
[09:50:11] <anoob> this form
[09:50:11] <rizwan> Hello, i am trying to use this $.getScript("myscrip.js",function .... >> and i get this error on console:
[09:50:12] <rizwan> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/rizwan/Desktop/GUIDE/guideScript.js?_=1307119679899. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:50:15] <anoob> click in name, for example
[09:50:20] <rizwan> what is the problem....??
[09:50:41] <anoob> it has 2 fields, if you click in last, the color doesn't change
[09:50:50] <anoob> i'm trying to do something like that
[09:50:56] <rizwan> i tried the same with simple file.js file with only alert statement and it worked fine... what could be the problem with this javascript file
[09:51:09] <anoob> if the fields are inside of the same fieldset (parent) i don't want to do the effect again
[09:51:41] <ccmonster> just do a fieldset check that the effect is active
[09:51:50] <ccmonster> just addClass when you initiate the effect
[09:52:03] <ccmonster> and also check if the class exists, if it does, then don't addClass.
[09:52:31] <anoob> oh, pretty simple
[09:52:34] <anoob> thank you ccmonster
[09:52:40] <ccmonster> njp
[09:52:42] <ccmonster> np*
[09:52:52] <rizwan> anybody help me understand what is this error >> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/rizwan/Desktop/GUIDE/guideScript.js?_=1307119679899. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:53:30] <ccmonster> yea, that's all he is doing. He is adding a 'focused' class to the 'li' parent when one of the children inputs is focused
[09:54:28] <ccmonster> then checks if hasClass('focused') , if it does then he doesn't do anything, otherwise removeClass('focused') of any LI that has it, then addClass('focused') to the correct one
[09:54:51] <ccmonster> google the origin null is not allowed part
[09:55:17] <ccmonster> "javascript origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
[09:55:21] <ccmonster> see what it says
[09:57:50] <magistr> <ccmonster> jquery is a very "fat" and slow  library, tell me another, please.
[09:57:58] <lmao25> how do i do a function AS i type a new character in an input field
[09:58:14] <ccmonster> slow? in what sense.
[09:58:25] <rizwan> Ok i solved my problem, it is a browser limitation. I need a webser for this test
[09:58:32] <ccmonster> Jquery is quite fast when it comes to traversing the dom, and is NOT fat if you min/pack
[09:58:40] <Phoenixz> I have multiple <div class='test'>.. if I $('.test').trigger(event); will this trigger be executed for all divs with class test or only one?
[09:58:48] <ccmonster> extJS if you like OOP style coding
[09:58:54] <ccmonster> Mootools as well
[09:59:03] <ccmonster> but not sure how 'fat' or 'fast' they are.
[09:59:05] <systemfault> ccmonster: jQuery is slow...
[09:59:20] <systemfault> But hey, it's easy to use :)
[09:59:27] <systemfault> And had tons of plugins.
[09:59:29] <systemfault> *has
[09:59:49] <ccmonster> Im not sure how you are determining slow, but ok
[09:59:49] <magistr> <ccmonster> ajax it is a very awful in jquery for example
[09:59:57] <systemfault> With other libraries, you have different calls depending if you need one or many nodes.
[10:00:01] <ccmonster> ajax is pretty easy in jquery
[10:00:06] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't bother with that.
[10:00:07] <Woet> doesn't seem like jquery is that slow
[10:00:07] <ajpiano> rizwan, you can't make ajax requests when you're developing on the file:/// protocol
[10:00:08] <Woet> http://blog.creonfx.com/javascript/dojo-vs-jquery-vs-mootools-vs-prototype-performance-comparison
[10:00:09] <systemfault> It's always "all"
[10:00:20] <ajpiano> systemfault, that's absurd.
[10:00:35] <ccmonster> get em ajpiano  :)
[10:00:54] <ajpiano> $("#foo") does not have the same overhead as $(".something div:not(.something) > :input")
[10:00:54] <ajpiano> etc.
[10:01:28] <systemfault> The DOM selector APIs have querySelector and querySelector all, jQuery only does querySelectorAll when it can.
[10:02:02] <systemfault> It simplifies the lib but that simplification has an overhead.
[10:02:10] <rizwan> thank you ajpiano, just a question since i am new to JQuery, can i call JQuery functions from within my functions. I mean are the globally avaialble
[10:02:22] <ajpiano> i'm trying to understand the connection between that and "jQuery is slow"
[10:02:27] <Phoenixz> rizwan: yes
[10:02:39] <rizwan> thanks Phoenixz,
[10:02:53] <ccmonster> i second that ajpiano . I am confused by the leap he's making, or the determinate for 'slow'
[10:02:59] <ajpiano> exactly.
[10:03:04] <systemfault> Ah, then I'm sorry.
[10:03:21] <rizwan> So that means i can put this $.getScript("test.js"); like script in my function and call this function e.g on button click events to load and do the magic
[10:03:40] <ccmonster> hey ajpiano , http://pastie.org/2014443 - how do I correctly pass in something to overwrite the external_search_url value?
[10:04:04] <ajpiano> uh?
[10:04:06] <ccmonster> searcher.init({external_search_url:'http://mynewsearch.html'}); ?
[10:04:10] <Phoenixz> rizwan: yes
[10:04:19] <smallfoot-> so i have a table with 10 rows, then i click on the row, and its in $(this), but how do i get the 3rd column of $(this) row ?
[10:04:21] <Phoenixz> rizwan: you can also just try it.. :) see if it works, makes you learn more
[10:04:31] <ajpiano> you'd have to write the init function to set the config option on a per instance basis
[10:04:36] <ryanneufeld> ccmonster: if you think jQuery is fat, extjs is MASSIVE
[10:04:39] <ajpiano> and merge the defaults with whateever they passed, using $.extend
[10:04:43] <Phoenixz> smallfoot-: see selector documentation.. you should be able to select the n-th item
[10:04:51] <ccmonster> yes rizwan , $('button).bind('click',function(e){$.getScript("text.js")})
[10:04:55] <ccmonster> or something to that efffet
[10:04:59] <ryanneufeld> ccmonster: wait, that was meant for someone else
[10:05:01] <Woet> ryanneufeld: extjs isn't for the same purpose as jquery
[10:05:11] <Phoenixz> ccmonster: what ryanneufeld says.. extjs is a friggin monster.. :)
[10:05:27] <ccmonster> i have no clue about the size of any other libs off the top
[10:05:30] <Woet> extjs is basically jquery with all possible plugins loaded
[10:05:37] <rizwan> thanks ccmonster, this would be even better
[10:05:39] <systemfault> And jqueryui :P
[10:05:40] <ryanneufeld> Woet: not really
[10:05:41] <ccmonster> in a OOp format
[10:05:53] <smallfoot-> Phoenixz, thanks
[10:06:01] <ryanneufeld> Woet: extjs is an application framework built in JS, and you pay for it
[10:06:10] <ryanneufeld> ccmonster: it's in the megabytes of size
[10:06:32] <Phoenixz> rizwan: if the button is already there (as in, its not dynamically loaded or created afterwards) you may also use  $('button).click(function(e){$.getScript("text.js")}) which is a nice shortcut
[10:07:30] <Phoenixz> smallfoot-: should be something like $(this).find('td:3') or something like that.. Not 100% sure, please check documentation for more
[10:07:42] <ccmonster> nice. Didn't realize. But it's usecase like you mentioned if rich web apps.
[10:07:43] <rizwan> so Phoenixz, that means i can simply after the <button> or may be <div> tag add a <script>$('button).click(function(e){$.getScript("text.js")})</script> to do this
[10:07:58] <ccmonster> different/focused target audience
[10:08:14] <ccmonster> add a doc ready on that rizwan
[10:08:32] <ccmonster> wrap it in a document.ready that is, and you should be good.
[10:08:36] <Phoenixz> ryanneufeld: The very few days that I toyed with extjs gave me migraines.. its heavy, bloated, slow..  Sure, it may give you an entire app framework, but at too high a price IMHO.. just plain jQuery does most of the nice needed effects..
[10:09:18] <rizwan> yes but i can not just execute it at run time,. I have the whole page in hidden divs and i need to manipulate them from external JS
[10:09:19] <smallfoot-> Phoenixz, apparently thats a syntax error
[10:09:33] <ezl> i want to use the scroll wheel to increment/decrement the value of an input box.
[10:09:35] <Phoenixz> rizwan: Actually, in the header you add a <script type='text/javascript'>$(document).ready(function(){   your button code ...  });</script>
[10:09:52] <Phoenixz> rizwan: that way, the .click() bind is only executed once the entire page is ready
[10:09:53] <ezl> i'm using the mouse wheel plugin to capture the scroll event, but i'm not sure how to change the inputbox value from there
[10:10:08] <smallfoot-> Phoenixz, code is alert($(this).find('td:nth-child(3)').text()); that works
[10:10:17] <ryanneufeld> Phoenixz: yeah, I have a friend who works for BMO, and has to use it. It takes so much more code to do the simplest things
[10:10:21] <ezl> how do i get the inputbox object?
[10:10:21] <Phoenixz> smallfoot-: as said, Im not sure about the precise syntax, please refer to the manual how, its one google search and 2 clicks away :)
[10:10:32] <smallfoot-> Phoenixz, yah i looked it up jquery api docs :)
[10:10:33] <Phoenixz> smallfoot-: there you go!
[10:10:38] <smallfoot-> :)
[10:10:47] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: that's not the most efficient way to do that though
[10:11:00] <smallfoot-> ryanneufeld, its not?
[10:11:07] <ryanneufeld> not really
[10:11:08] <ryanneufeld> no
[10:11:09] <smallfoot-> oh
[10:11:11] <smallfoot-> i dont konw any other way
[10:11:46] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: What would you do? select all TD and use [] ?
[10:11:50] <Phoenixz> rizwan: if you use the <script type='text/javascript'>$(document).ready(function(){   your button code ...  });</script> it should capture quite nicely..
[10:12:10] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: yes, it's faster
[10:12:18] <rizwan> Just a question, can i execute exterJS without having the page to invoke $.getScript("text.js"); Like i want to control the page from my external C++ app in real time. Is this possible without taking any input from page and feeding it javascript from external JS
[10:12:19] <ryanneufeld> I'm making a fiddle
[10:12:52] <mipo> how to get length of checkbox if checked!
[10:12:56] <ccmonster> and personally, i'd do a bind('click'....
[10:12:59] <ccmonster> instead of a click.
[10:13:16] <ccmonster> but im not sure if thats just preference or true added value in doing that.
[10:14:15] <rizwan> Phoenixz, do you have any suggestion please?
[10:14:34] <systemfault> ccmonster: It's just preference, bind is a more general interface :)
[10:14:58] <systemfault> I wish they would have taken "on" instead of "bind"
[10:15:32] <systemfault> $("selector").on('click', ....
[10:15:53] <ccmonster> eh,bind sounds more permanent, which is what you're doing basically
[10:16:10] <ccmonster> its semantic masturbation at that point, but good option either way
[10:16:19] <systemfault> I agree
[10:16:47] <janthony> $("#work-enlargement").load($(this).attr("href")).hide().fadeIn("slow"); - Any idea why this isn't fading in? Something tells me it's the .load().
[10:17:17] <Klevre> enlargement
[10:17:40] <Tant102> I'm guessing that it's hidden and faded, and the load is async and will load the content after the fadein is complete?
[10:17:56] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: http://jsfiddle.net/qKXet/1/
[10:17:57] <Woet> janthony: and did you debug the contents of $(this).attr("href") to be sure it's valid?
[10:18:10] <Woet> janthony: oh, nevermind.
[10:18:35] <Tant102> So, throw the fadeIn call in the callback.
[10:18:40] <Tant102> Still just guesses... ;)
[10:18:43] <janthony> Tant102: Well, even if #work-enlargment wasn't display: none, wouldn't it sitll work since i did .hide() right before the fadeIn?
[10:19:30] <Tant102> janthony, and it was hidden. And faded in. And perhaps after those events your load() returns, and sets the content.
[10:19:35] <Phoenixz> rizwan:  ccmonster: difference between using bind(), live(), click() is mostly an issue for a) if you add the item later.. for example, the button doesnt exist yet, but you alredy execute $('.button').click(), then it won't work.. .live('button', fn) will do.. 2) live() and bind() may cause very large sites / interfaces to slow down because it may cause many event handlers to be executed.. Not 100% sure anymore about the issues, but I saw a rather
[10:19:36] <Phoenixz> nice google talks video on youtube from john resig about the subject..
[10:20:10] <janthony> Tant102: Ahh, so what you're saying is my load may be firing after my fadeIn?
[10:20:28] <Tant102> janthony: 1) load() starts, 2) hide() called, 3) fadeIn() called, 4) load() finishes and sets the content.
[10:20:35] <smallfoot-> ryanneufeld, thats better? why
[10:20:50] <janthony> Tant102: Gotchya, so I should set my fadeIn in the fallback of the .load()?
[10:20:53] <Tant102> That's how they would act if the load() takes some time.
[10:21:13] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: slice is faster than having the sizzle selector engine navigate through the dom to find the nth child
[10:21:34] <Tant102> janthony, $("#work-enlargement").load($(this).attr("href"), function() { $(this).fadeIn("slow"); }).hide();
[10:21:55] <smallfoot-> ryanneufeld, ah okay thanks
[10:22:39] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: np
[10:22:43] <phlp> ryanneufeld: nth-child is valid css so unless you are using ie the browser handles it (fast)
[10:23:02] <janthony> Tant102: That was it, perfect! Thanks!
[10:23:38] <Tant102> janthony, nice. Then I have a reason to celebrate, and run to the closest shop and grab me an icecream. ;)
[10:23:49] <janthony> Tant102: haha
[10:26:49] <systemfault> phlp: In the real world though, 50% use IE :/
[10:27:13] <systemfault> And before IE8.. :/ No comments.
[10:27:36] <djQuery> systemfault: just read that is is now down to 54% use IE. Also read the google is going to drop support for ie7
[10:28:17] <phlp> systemfault: in the real world both versions are slow in ie so use the one that is fast in a modern browser which microsoft will eventually produce
[10:28:47] <systemfault> djQuery: Yeah, It's good news
[10:29:08] <systemfault> djQuery: They said they will only support "current and current - 1" of every browser
[10:29:23] <systemfault> From august 1st IIRC
[10:29:33] <systemfault> (Might be wrong on the date though)
[10:29:35] <muszek> hi... I have an internationalized app that uses __() function (PHP) to output internationalized strings (for example __('some string') echoes "some string" when lang is english and "jakis ciag" when lang is Polish.  When I use js code embedded in html, it's not a problem (php prints correct strings to he js file).  how about external javascript files?  how do you tackle this problem?  My idea is to have hidden html elements that contain localized strin
[10:29:35] <muszek> gs. Example: <div id="some_string" class="hidden">jakis ciag</div>.  and in jquery I'd do $('#some_string').text(); to get that value.  Or perhaps empty divs with html5's data- attribute: <div id="some_string" data-id="jakis ciag"></div>
[10:29:41] <djQuery> systemfault: "Each time a new version is released, we'll begin supporting the update and stop supporting the third-oldest version"
[10:29:51] <djQuery> systemfault: "By that scheme, Google will stop supporting IE7, Firefox 3.5, Apple's Safari 3 and its own Chrome 9, all which have released two newer versions."
[10:29:55] <freeed> ajpiano, ps.. love the bocoup source code. bravo! :p
[10:30:40] <muszek> s/php prints correct strings to he js file/php prints correct strings to the js code
[10:30:46] <systemfault> djQuery: Ah right :)
[10:30:56] <Tant102> muszek, we've got an asp.net site that solves that by exporting complete resource files (list of key/value) as json.
[10:32:42] <asoare> Hi guys, I need some help handling the copy event. I'm doing $("#some_id").bind('copy', function(e) { alert('copying text!'); }); and whenever I copy something, the alert box appears twice. Why does that happen? Why is the event triggered twice? Thank you!
[10:32:46] <Phoenixz> I have multiple <div class='test'>.. if I $('.test').trigger(event); will this trigger be executed for all divs with class test or only one?
[10:32:53] <muszek> Tant102: thanks
[10:33:59] <na3r> i want an editor that can loads an images and user can select some area on pic and link them to a url. is there any plugin
[10:34:04] <mipo> has is(":checked") for checkbox?
[10:34:23] <na3r> like this
[10:34:24] <na3r> http://www.asreertebat.com/
[10:34:36] <na3r> http://www.asreertebat.com/1390/3/7/AsreErtebat_weekly/407/Page/1/
[10:36:22] <djQuery> systemfault: and with ie10 preview allready out maybe it wont be long to get rid of 8
[10:36:28] <bid> hi, where can i find "how to write jquery plugin" docs?
[10:37:02] <Phoenixz> bid: jquery documentation page? :)
[10:37:06] <systemfault> djQuery: Somehow, I wonder if they're really going to do that.
[10:37:16] <Phoenixz> bid: no seriously, jquery documentation page...
[10:37:32] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-nth-child#run
[10:37:34] <systemfault> djQuery: It's difficult to imagine google simply not supporting IE8 in a year or two maximum
[10:37:51] <djQuery> systemfault: all it realy means is that they stop testing it heavily
[10:38:02] <systemfault> djQuery: Until they get complains :P
[10:38:15] <Phoenixz> systemfault: could they please just stop making internet explorer all together? with FF and Chrome, Opera, etc, we have enough browsers.. Nobody would really miss it :)
[10:38:31] <systemfault> Phoenixz: I would love :D
[10:38:52] <systemfault> Phoenixz: But hey, seems they're really trying to get back in the game since IE8
[10:39:03] <Phoenixz> How can I trigger an event for multiple elements? $('.class').trigger(event); where there are 5 tags with .class, triggers only for one of these tags..
[10:39:22] <ryanneufeld> could I get a few people here to hit this http://jsperf.com/slice-vs-nth-child#run
[10:39:23] <KWhat_Work> is there a ui-icon-blank?
[10:39:24] <mipo> na3r : that's dont nee any editor!
[10:39:37] <systemfault> Sure
[10:39:50] <Phoenixz> systemfault: Well, so far, too little, too late.. Even IE9 still lags very much behind other browsers (though its not at a pathetic level anymore like IE7 and 8)
[10:39:57] <na3r> mipo, how can i do that?
[10:40:04] <Phoenixz> ryanneufeld: I'd hit that... :)
[10:40:05] <mipo> load normally any image and set border effect on hover style
[10:40:07] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: Done :P
[10:40:13] <ryanneufeld> Thanks guys
[10:40:18] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: nth-child being twice as slow on chrome 14 alpha :P
[10:40:24] <mipo> na3r :  load normally any image and set border effect on hover style
[10:40:33] <ryanneufeld> and every other browser I've tried
[10:40:58] <djQuery> Phoenixz: all the stupid corps that put vbscrpt in thier corp websites would miss it
[10:41:28] <systemfault> Eww vbscript :/
[10:41:41] <Phoenixz> djQuery: Then again, we would not miss any corps that would use vbscript in their website :)
[10:41:49] <na3r> mipo, i don't want to set border
[10:41:55] <systemfault> Another thing corps would miss is how you can lockdown functionalities in IE easily
[10:42:19] <na3r> i want select area on image and link it to a url
[10:42:23] <smallfoot-> ryanneufeld, thanks
[10:42:31] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: no problem
[10:42:41] <ryanneufeld> I was surprised by the results myself
[10:42:45] <smallfoot-> oh
[10:44:49] <t0nttu> Is there a way to do .css() manipulation of the border-image property? Browsers only support shorthand!
[10:45:13] <Phoenixz> Argh... Why is it that $('.class').trigger(event); will only execute that trigger for one element, even though $('.class') selects 5 elements??
[10:47:14] <chrisbowden> exit
[10:54:29] <csaunders> what is responsible for telling the footer bar to be stuck at the bottom or floating (in jquery mobile)?
[10:57:43] <d4rklit31> hi
[10:57:47] <d4rklit31> o no
[10:58:01] <d4rklit31> well at least chanserv lets me talk in here :)
[10:58:25] <djQuery> Phoenixz: its those same corps that help ie adaption back all this time
[10:58:30] <d4rklit31> im looking to select all <a> tags in a page
[10:58:33] <d4rklit31> and replace their target attr
[10:58:48] <d4rklit31> im looking in the docs for selectors, but im not sure which is which
[10:59:32] <djQuery> d4rklit31: $('a').attr('target', 'whatever');
[11:00:34] <d4rklit31> yeah djQuery
[11:00:35] <d4rklit31> thanks
[11:00:41] <d4rklit31> heh so simple it was complicated :P
[11:00:50] <djQuery> d4rklit31: or to only replace ones that have a specific target   $('a[target="whatever"]).attr("target", "sometinelse");
[11:01:08] <mipo> how to find checkbox if checked with for?
[11:01:55] <d4rklit31> djQuery: if i wanted to take every a tag, take its href and prepend something to it
[11:02:11] <d4rklit31> do i do something like $("a").each
[11:02:25] <d4rklit31> or
[11:02:28] <ryanneufeld> smallfoot-: .slice is a direct call to the native array slice, so it's stupid fast :)
[11:02:35] <d4rklit31> $.each("a", function (i) { } );
[11:02:57] <smallfoot-> ah i see
[11:07:48] <phlp> added slice here and nth-child is almost 3 times as fast. you were right for that case though http://jsperf.com/jquery-first-child-selection-performance/4
[11:08:10] <blindMoe> anyone mind showing me the proper way to do this?  $('div.tab[rel='+$(this).data('tabId')+']').show();
[11:08:21] <obrienmd> I'm having a problem with binding clicks to a button in a modal dialog... The first time I run the bind, which happens after the dialog is populated, it works great. However, after the dialog is removed from the page, and brought up again, the bind runs, I can see the onclick bind in debugger, but the actions inside the function bound are not carried out... Anyone seen something like this before? $('input.ctools-use-ajax.form-submit
[11:08:54] <djQuery> d4rklit31: what are u trying to accomplish?
[11:09:05] <ryanneufeld> obrienmd: try .live('click', function(){}); instead of .click()
[11:10:08] <obrienmd> ryanneufeld, will do thank
[11:10:09] <obrienmd> s
[11:10:31] <djQuery> d4rklit31: and it would be $('a[href]').each(function(i,elm){ $(elm).attr('href', this.href + '&test=true');  });
[11:11:05] <rpflo> Hey folks, can you please answer this question about CSS Transitions? https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEZtTDVjM2Nwby1rcXBfU09tNnU2Wmc6MQ
[11:11:37] <obrienmd> ryanneufeld: does .live re-check everytime the DOM changes? is it a performance killer?
[11:12:03] <rpflo> obrienmd: most events "bubble" so it's actually a performance boost in many cases
[11:12:51] <rpflo> obrienmd: every event has a target element, event delegation is really just checking if that target matches the selector you're delegating to, so it doesn't have to "re-check" the DOM, it just has to check the target element
[11:13:34] <sven_oostenbrink> obrienmd: Lost the link, but there is a very nice googletalks video on youtube from john resig about this subject...
[11:13:36] <obrienmd> ah, thanks
[11:14:30] <sven_oostenbrink> obrienmd: I think the title was somethign about "efficient javascript"
[11:14:48] <obrienmd> that sounds nice :)
[11:16:18] <obrienmd> $('input.ctools-use-ajax.form-submit').live('click', function() { alert('test') });
[11:16:23] <obrienmd> hrm, not binding at all now
[11:16:37] <obrienmd> anything wrong w/ my syntax?
[11:19:10] <phlp> obrienmd: just in case http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false
[11:19:16] <KWhat_Work> will .attr('checked', false); work  or do i need to explicitly remove the attr
[11:23:54] <magistr> $("#box p").get(-1).scrollIntoView(true);     $("#box p").get(-1) is undefined
[11:24:07] <magistr> what's wrong?
[11:25:41] <phlp> $("#box p").length == 0
[11:26:38] <obrienmd> phlp: thanks, will review - I'm a novice, so given the title it may be the right thing to read :)
[11:31:46] <jaequery> does javascript have any php's equivalent of isset() or empty() methods?
[11:32:11] <jaequery> i've always been doing if(bla == undefined)  .... and it feels too dirty
[11:32:18] <magistr>  $("#box p:last").get().scrollIntoView is not a function
[11:32:50] <obrienmd> so, no go on any of those tips... the bind is definitely happening, and when i look at that object's binds in the console, that is the only click bind... but the stuff immediately inside the bound function isn't firing
[11:32:50] <rpflo> jaequery: not an exact equivalent, no but very often `if (!foo)` is enough
[11:32:56] <obrienmd> so odd
[11:32:59] <magistr> $("#box p:last").get().scrollIntoView(true);
[11:33:21] <Woet> i have an image that I want to be able to rotate
[11:33:25] <Woet> like drag
[11:33:31] <Woet> is there any existing plugin for this?
[11:33:45] <rpflo> jaequery: you can also do stuff like `var foo = obj.bar || 'bar'`
[11:33:50] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/Xce6W/15/ - how do I get the li's id (it's a category name) on the selected event?
[11:33:59] <ccmonster> any help with the selector would be appreciated
[11:34:21] <jaequery> rpflo: what you mean by very often
[11:34:55] <jaequery> under what circumstance will it work and not work?
[11:34:55] <rpflo> jaequery: well, if obj doesn't exist, and you do if (obj.foo) it's an error because obj doesn't exist so you can't check for foo
[11:35:17] <rpflo> some people do it like if (obj && obj.foo) to get around it
[11:35:26] <magistr> <ccmonster> $("#box p:last").get().scrollIntoView(); but $("#box p:last").get().scrollIntoView is not a function
[11:35:33] <jaequery> rpflo: how do you normally do it?
[11:35:45] <ccmonster> huh?
[11:36:07] <rpflo> jaequery: depends on what I'm what I'm checking ... sometimes you even need to do `if (foo != null)` in the case of allowing for 0
[11:36:09] <ccmonster> it's the get()
[11:36:15] <phlp> ccmonster: it shows the id for me in the console. were you wanting something else?
[11:36:18] <rpflo> jaequery: but most of the time `if (!foo)` is enough
[11:36:53] <ccmonster> the cat_ThisCategory in th console?
[11:37:03] <phlp> yes
[11:37:09] <Tidwell> rpflo: why would you go through all that extra headache when you can just use === and !== to type-check as well and use typeof to check "isset"
[11:37:17] <magistr> The .get() method grants us access to the DOM nodes underlying each jQuery object. Suppose we had a simple unordered list on the page:
[11:37:27] <magistr> whats wrong?
[11:37:34] <ccmonster> click a sub cateogry
[11:37:51] <ccmonster> watch it duplicate. Which is odd.
[11:37:59] <ccmonster> but I guess it's due to it being nested
[11:38:07] <ccmonster> so it triggers for both
[11:38:11] <rpflo> Tidwell: it all depends on what you're doing
[11:38:14] <coachz> I'm having trouble getting my .click event to fire.  I'm doing   $("span").click(function() { alert("HI"): }   in my doc ready,  Jquery is loaded and I have this in my page   <span class="stdLink feedbacksidebarlink">Feedback</span>
[11:38:33] <coachz> i also tried referencing the class but no luck
[11:38:37] <ccmonster> there is a colon. should be a semi-colon after "hi")
[11:38:48] <Tidwell> rpflo: I suppose so, I just find that unless you are really wanting to check for truthiness its better to use strict comparison operators
[11:38:48] <coachz> oh, typo, it is in my code
[11:38:51] <magistr> <ccmonster> How to realize autoscroll in your library?
[11:39:03] <rpflo> Tidwell: but `if (typeof foo === 'undefined')` is more of a headache than `if (!foo)` to me :\
[11:39:06] <ccmonster> autoscroll? im lost
[11:39:07] <phlp> ccmonster: to stop the dupe in success use event.stopPropagation();
[11:39:37] <ccmonster> ahh yes, it's bubbling up. let me try
[11:39:42] <natrixnatrix89> Hi. If there is a function that I have to execute before anything is loaded.. What would be the event that I could bind it? or how else I could call that function so that the browser wouldn't wait until images are loaded to execute that function..
[11:39:52] <coachz> and    if (typeof jQuery != 'undefined') {   alert("jQuery is loaded");  }   returns  "jQuery is loaded"
[11:39:58] <magistr> <ccmonster> *with your library
[11:40:16] <magistr> <ccmonster> it is realy?
[11:40:30] <rpflo> natrixnatrix89: dont' bind it to anything, just call the function if you don't want to wait for anything to load
[11:40:31] <chovy> anyone have a simple function to be able to swipe a carousel left/right?
[11:40:32] <ccmonster> magistr, what are you asking about?
[11:40:52] <ccmonster> i dont know of any chovy myself.
[11:41:03] <natrixnatrix89> rpflo: so this would be faster than document.ready ?
[11:41:09] <magistr> <ccmonster> about autoscrolling
[11:41:20] <ccmonster> autoscrolling on what?
[11:41:28] <magistr> ScrollToDown
[11:41:29] <coachz> a click listener is so simple, what could I be missing?
[11:41:56] <coachz> in chrome inspector i see the element     <span class="stdLink feedbacksidebarlink">Feedback</span>
[11:42:00] <rpflo> natrixnatrix89: the second the browser sees the function being called, it will be called, so it's as fast as possible.  Put it in a script tag in your header before anything and it'll be the first thing that happens ... but what you do in there matters
[11:42:07] <ccmonster> coachz, do a fiddle or pastie of your code, then do a ## in the pastie and show the error output you are seeing in the console
[11:42:34] <coachz> this code is someone elses clusterf**k,  there is no way to fiddle anything even close
[11:42:42] <coachz> it would take me all day
[11:42:46] <coachz> or week even
[11:42:47] <natrixnatrix89> rpflo: ok. I hope it would still be ok if its in *.js that is called in the head?
[11:43:14] <coachz> i'm dynamically creating the span, i'll try with a manually created one first
[11:43:31] <rpflo> natrixnatrix89: yep.  (function(){ alert('hi') })() <-- called an Immediately Invoked Function Expression, plop that up top and it'll be called the second hte browser sees it
[11:43:32] <ccmonster> do a pastie then
[11:43:34] <magistr> <ccmonster>  $("#box p:last").get().scrollIntoView();
[11:44:14] <ccmonster> magistr, do a fiddle of your code/html
[11:44:18] <phlp> magistr: get() with no index returns an array
[11:44:49] <coachz> that works on my manually created span
[11:45:28] <ccmonster> ok coachz , now since you are dynamically creating the span, test by creatin ga variable to hold the reference, after it's created, and check it via the console
[11:45:58] <coachz> not sure what you mean on how to hold the reference
[11:46:28] <ccmonster> reference = $('span.myDynamicSpance');
[11:46:46] <ccmonster> console.log("ref:",reference);
[11:47:04] <coachz> myDynamiSpance is my class on that span ?
[11:47:12] <danstever> hey everyone - Any one know a good way to style a scrollbar?
[11:47:16] <ccmonster> yeap.
[11:47:36] <coachz> thanks ccmonster  i know this is hard to figure without js fiddle
[11:47:41] <phlp> coachz: if you are binding the click before you create the element it's not going to work. look at .live or bind after you create
[11:47:42] <chovy> http://chovy.dyndns.org/swipe01.htm
[11:48:15] <coachz> the click is in the doc ready and the element is created ahead of that
[11:49:27] <ccmonster> yea, that was my assumption that it's not on the dom or something, so logging out the obj should help
[11:49:44] <coachz> i get   ref:  []
[11:49:50] <ccmonster> then, it's empty
[11:50:00] <ccmonster> so its not on the dom or something
[11:50:11] <coachz> and when i inspect the element it's there
[11:50:27] <ccmonster> but it's not there at the moment that the operation is occurring.
[11:50:28] <coachz> it's being build dynamically through a php function
[11:50:58] <ccmonster> go into the console right now and do a "console.log(reference);"
[11:51:19] <TylerE> Does anyone know of a lightbox that will work when embedded in an iframe? THe ones I've tried only apply the lightbox effect within the boundaries of the iframe
[11:51:21] <ccmonster> if it's showing up in the dom now, and the console/jquery are reading it, it's a timing issue.
[11:51:40] <coachz> undefined
[11:51:55] <coachz> and if i inspect element it's there
[11:52:02] <ccmonster> so jquery can't capture the ref because it doesnt exist to it
[11:52:06] <ccmonster> :|
[11:52:29] <coachz> and inspect shows     <span class="stdLink feedbacksidebarlink">Feedback</span>
[11:52:29] <systemfault> TylerE: It's normal, an iframe is like another window, it's not part of your page.

[11:53:25] <magistr> How to manipulate with element od DOM? I need method scrollIntoView
[11:53:43] <coachz> is there a solution to this chicken and the egg paradox ?
[11:54:49] <GeoDud> @coachz what phlp said
[11:54:51] <coachz> do i need http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:55:16] <coachz> ok i'll try live, thank you guys
[11:56:02] <ccmonster> live will most certainly work
[11:56:26] <ccmonster> there is the possibility of uneeded overhead with live, but it will def solve your dom issue
[11:56:48] <magistr> #box  - is a block element, has widh and height, scroll=auto, #box consists many of paragraph. How to realize autoscroll with your library?

[12:03:34] <danstever> hi guys - Sorry i just asked this: my network went out: Any direction to style a browser scrollbar in a specific div?
[12:04:52] <magistr> when overflow is happened last element must be in visible area
[12:07:10] <ccmonster> what sort of elements are they?
[12:07:21] <ccmonster> because you can do a scrollTo and find the :last
[12:07:53] <tman> $(".carousel").children().not("img") <- in the console returns me the divs without the two images
[12:08:01] <tman> $(".carousel").children().not("img").remove(); removes everything
[12:08:15] <tman> why does the console return what i want but the remove ignore it?
[12:08:26] <magistr> <tman> thanks
[12:08:54] <magistr> <tman> I remove elements in box and show the last element
[12:09:52] <danstever> exit
[12:11:48] <phlp> tman: are the img inside the div?
[12:12:59] <magistr> <tman> it is works, but scrollIntoView() not.
[12:14:10] <magistr> Whichs native DOM methods works with jquery?
[12:15:25] <crankharder> for a form with multiple buttons -- is it possible to access the button that was clicked from within a submit event?
[12:17:06] <magistr> paragraph in the div element named #box
[12:17:23] <magistr> thay also a block elements
[12:17:48] <magistr> and has position:static
[12:18:37] <ccmonster> so you have multiple button sin a form
[12:18:49] <ccmonster> they all trigger the same submit event?
[12:18:59] <ccmonster> but you want to know which button triggered that unified submit event?
[12:19:12] <magistr> last element must be in visible area
[12:19:39] <phlp> crankharder: event.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget
[12:19:39] <ccmonster> you could pass the buttons name, or id to the submit event
[12:19:47] <magistr> #box consists only a paragraphs
[12:19:56] <magistr> many paragraphs
[12:20:02] <blindMoe> instead of me hunting through a million options on google.. can anyone recommend a lite shadowbox plugin?
[12:20:12] <ccmonster> scrollTo(#box p:last) or something
[12:21:16] <magistr> and scrollIntoView doesn't work
[12:21:49] <magistr> in native javascript it's work correctly
[12:23:01] <ccmonster> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832860/how-to-scroll-the-window-using-jquery-scrollto-function
[12:23:53] <magistr> scrollTo is a plugin
[12:24:18] <magistr> in your "fat" library
[12:24:29] <mipo> how to get checkboxs ids with loop?
[12:26:12] <magistr> $("#box p:last").scrollTop = $("#chatbox p:last").scrollHeight;
[12:26:20] <magistr> #box
[12:26:40] <magistr> but it doesn't work
[12:27:19] <magistr> it is a property, yes?
[12:28:45] <phlp> magistr: alert($("#box p:last").length)
[12:28:50] <phlp> magistr: what does it say
[12:29:14] <magistr> <phlp> it is not a solve.
[12:29:33] <phlp> magistr: it is not the question
[12:32:30] <magistr> <phlp> it is a collection or array of one element, which has zero index.
[12:34:37] <magistr> but length=0
[12:34:46] <magistr> it is a jquery
[12:36:14] <magistr> very awul library
[12:36:28] <phlp> magistr: read this http://jqfundamentals.com/book/#chapter-3
[12:37:08] <ajpiano> scrollTop is a method dawg
[12:38:39] <phlp> probably thinking of scrollTo
[12:41:21] <magistr> and whereis "syntax sugar"?  library should simplify operation with DOM elements, why not?
[12:41:58] <jayar> how do i wait till animate() is done, and then continue?
[12:42:12] <ccmonster> queue and dequeue
[12:42:49] <jayar> thnx
[12:42:51] <ajpiano> what in blazes are you on about?
[12:43:19] <ajpiano> jayar, you use the callback
[12:45:17] <magistr> And native methodscrollIntoView doesn't work.  It is sad
[12:45:24] <jayar> ok, im using the callback. maybe i just cant fadeIn() a flash movie
[12:45:24] <ccmonster> i thougth queue and deqeue was a good way to handle animations
[12:45:24] <ccmonster> ?
[12:45:42] <jayar> the movies there, but it kinda just blinks in.
[12:45:52] <ccmonster> magistr, google for solutions, ask nicely, but please quick complaining on needlessly.
[12:46:31] <magistr> <ccmonster> good answer.
[12:46:36] <phlp> or just listening to suggestions would help
[12:46:49] <ccmonster> that always works as well :0
[12:46:54] <ajpiano> magistr: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[12:46:58] <ajpiano> it's a method
[12:48:02] <swiggy> can i serialize just 1 peice of data in a post?
[12:48:08] <swiggy> or not even serialize it
[12:48:18] <swiggy> just encode it so it doesnt break at ' & '
[12:48:31] <swiggy> if someone posts, and their content has a '&' in it, it breaks
[12:48:46] <swiggy> obviously serialize will fix this, but then the script needs to be recoded
[12:48:59] <swiggy> and i would rather just 'encode' the one variable causing a problem
[12:49:05] <gnarf> ?mdc encodeURIComponent
[12:49:07] <bot-t> gnarf, encodeURIComponent - MDC Docs - Encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character ... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[12:49:18] <gnarf> ^^^ @swiggy
[12:49:20] <magistr> <ajpiano> and scrollIntoView is  not a method?
[12:49:36] <swiggy> there isnt a jquery func?
[12:49:39] <ajpiano> that's a dom Element method
[12:49:42] <gnarf> swiggy: although if you use $.post and pass an object to data, it does that for you
[12:49:42] <swiggy> what about .param?
[12:49:53] <swiggy> data: "title="+ title +"& content="+ content +"& submitted="+ submitted +"& replyid="+ replyid +"& handle="+ handle,
[12:49:53] <gnarf> swiggy: yeah param will call encodeURIComponent
[12:49:56] <swiggy> is my ajax data
[12:50:00] <swiggy> but i need to encode
[12:50:01] <gnarf> swiggy: thats retarted
[12:50:05] <swiggy> the content variable
[12:50:12] <swiggy>  i know it is
[12:50:15] <swiggy> i did not design this
[12:50:15] <magistr> <ajpiano> and jquery not supports him?
[12:50:21] <gnarf> swiggy: { title: title, content: content, submitted: submitted, replyid: replyid, handle: handle }
[12:50:31] <gnarf> if you want the spaces before the keys, add " content":
[12:50:42] <swiggy> what about just encoding 'content'
[12:50:45] <swiggy> not the rest of it
[12:50:46] <gnarf> swiggy: if you use an object as your post data, it will encode them
[12:50:47] <swiggy> just the content
[12:50:59] <gnarf> swiggy: use the fn JS function I just linked you to
[12:51:13] <swiggy> var content   = $('#content').attr('value').param();
[12:51:19] <swiggy> ok
[12:51:20] <mrgreenfur> Does anyone know how I can get the style attributes for a :hover css style? I'd like to copy it to another element.
[12:51:40] <gnarf> swiggy: best practice is to use the damn object tho
[12:51:45] <gnarf> not that you care
[12:51:57] <swiggy> :P
[12:54:21] <gnarf> magistr: you can still get the DOM object and call that function on it
[12:54:44] <phlp> that's how all this started
[12:55:14] <magistr> <gnarf> with the .get ?
[12:55:28] <gnarf> magistr: sure
[12:56:22] <magistr> jquery has BSD license, why?
[12:57:50] <gnarf> magistr: wrong: http://jquery.org/license/
[12:59:53] <magistr> <gnarf> only selectors and .css are works correctly.
[13:00:15] <magistr> ajax is awfull((
[13:00:37] <gnarf> magistr: see ?p i can't understand "awfull((" or "are works correctly"
[13:00:37] <bot-t> magistr, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[13:02:45] <roger_padactor> if i have a table with id #bla and I wanted to get the only a tag somewhere in that table can I just do $('#bla a') ?
[13:02:47] <walid> is there a way to select all elements that have as style attribute {overflow-y: auto} ?
[13:03:34] <phlp> roger_padactor: yes
[13:04:34] <magistr> <gnarf> It is necessary to write the own libraries javascript
[13:04:51] <phlp> magistr: u so fun
[13:05:37] <gnarf> magistr: what language is your first? because maybe someone can help you in your native tounge... you aren't making much sense
[13:05:38] <magistr> <phlp> only own libraries,  it is right way!
[13:06:45] <walid> is there a way to select all elements that have as style attribute {overflow-y: auto} ?
[13:07:07] <phlp> use a class?
[13:07:54] <gnarf> walid: phlp's suggestion is the best, however -- it is >possible<
[13:08:12] <phlp> $('[style*="overflow-y:auto"]')
[13:08:58] <walid> gnarf: phlp hm i want to add jScrollPane to ALL items containing overflow:none
[13:09:16] <beakybal4> hi all
[13:09:20] <walid> that's why
[13:09:33] <walid> so.. rather than getting each DOM
[13:09:33] <walid> ;)
[13:09:37] <MagusOTB> Before I look into how to file a bug report, is the fact that both buttons in http://jsfiddle.net/magusOTB/cgpqg/ end up with the same label actually a bug?
[13:09:38] <beakybal4> is anyone here familiar with blueimp's jquery upload script?
[13:09:48] <walid> also, i'm using drupal, so it can be a pain to add a class for this
[13:10:18] <phlp> walid: overflow:none is not valid
[13:10:19] <beakybal4> geekbuntu: hi
[13:10:23] <gnarf> walid: probably less of a pain than selecting EVERY dom element and filtering based on style
[13:10:30] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: hi
[13:11:06] <walid> gnarf: you reckon? If I ONLY set overflow:auto to the elements concerned, then it should be okay, no?
[13:11:26] <gnarf> walid: to find them you still need to search EVERY element
[13:12:06] <gnarf> if you can make it a class, then its way easier
[13:15:24] <systemfault> Is it possible to add a styling class to jqueryui widgets?
[13:15:50] <systemfault> So i can add a specific style to a single one.
[13:17:24] <beakybal4> anyone here use blueimp's jquery upload script?
[13:17:26] <phlp> .addClass('system-fault-menu')
[13:17:49] <magistr> .addClass only :)
[13:18:09] <systemfault> phlp: I add it to what?
[13:18:15] <magistr> and other css functions
[13:18:19] <ajpiano> systemfault: at the moment, you can use addClass like phlp said - in the future we are working on a mechanism for handling the classing of widgets in a bit more malleable way
[13:18:33] <roger_padactor> weird. i have 3 inputs in a row that are class="date" once a dialog opens  i run $('.date').datepicker()  when I click on the first input nothing happens if i click on the second the date picker opens then from there on out all the inputs work. I dont get it.
[13:18:42] <phlp> magistr: y u property it method be
[13:18:45] <ajpiano> magistr, please stop talking if you have nothing constructive to say or ask
[13:18:52] <systemfault> ajpiano: I wanted to style an autocomplete popup become we have some stupid requirements at work
[13:19:15] <systemfault> ajpiano: I guess I could add a class to the body :(
[13:19:19] <tman> is there a way to add a callback to a .each function such that my next block of logic only runs once the interations through the .each have completed?
[13:19:28] <ajpiano> systemfault: if you get the "widget instance" from the data cache
[13:19:41] <ajpiano> you can get references to the elements that comprise the autocomplete widget
[13:19:50] <Tidwell> tman: .each will finish before going on to whats next, its not asynchronous
[13:20:00] <ajpiano> console.dir($("#elementYouCalledAutocompleteOn").data("autocomplete"))
[13:20:15] <systemfault> ajpiano: I'll check that, thank you :D
[13:21:07] <asoare> Hi guys, I need some help handling the copy event. I'm doing $("#some_id").bind('copy', function(e) { alert('copying text!'); }); and whenever I copy something, the alert box appears twice. Why does that happen? Why is the event triggered twice? Thank you!
[13:21:14] <magistr> <ajpiano> why scrollIntoView don't works with your library? tell me please
[13:22:23] <Tidwell> asoare: are you using a plugin?  'copy' is not a default eventType to bind to
[13:23:11] <ajpiano> you can bind to any browser events that happen, however support is not necessarily bound to be consistent
[13:23:26] <phlp> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/cutcopypaste.html
[13:25:10] <Tidwell> ajpiano: woops, replace "default" with "normalized" in my last then :P
[13:25:46] <walid> gnarf: thanks, i'll do it the tiring way, but that's ok ;P
[13:27:45] <tomtomdie> What carousel ( slider ), dropdown, lightbox plugins would you recommend.  I'm looking for ones that are lightweight and without a lot of bloat.
[13:27:55] <magistr> #box is a block element with  overflow:auto property. also it has width and height, which consists of many paragraphs.
[13:28:28] <magistr> normal flow, yep
[13:30:00] <magistr> but when overflow happened, last paragraph must be in visible area.
[13:32:24] <magistr> $("#box p:last").scrollIntoView();
[13:32:25] <julien_may> hi
[13:32:31] <magistr> not work
[13:32:52] <systemfault> ajpiano: Thanks, it worked wonderfully.
[13:34:26] <julien_may> can someone tell me how's the Raw XML API Dump for jquery got created? e.g. what tools has being used.
[13:34:56] <magistr> <systemfault> jquery don't works wonderfully. It is great mistake
[13:35:42] <systemfault> magistr: You don't seem to understand the word "context"
[13:36:02] <systemfault> magistr: I had a problem, he helped me to solved it so his fixed worked wonderfully..
[13:36:19] <systemfault> Either jquery being wonderful or not is totally out of the context.
[13:36:24] <magistr> <systemfault> illusion!
[13:36:48] <systemfault> *fix
[13:36:51] <gnarf> magistr: there is no jQuery function "scrollIntoView" of course it doesn't work
[13:37:06] <gnarf> magistr: and stop being bitter
[13:37:38] <magistr> <gnarf> why? it is native DOM method.
[13:38:02] <gnarf> the jQuery set is NOT a native DOM element
[13:38:16] <magistr> it is sad
[13:38:31] <gnarf> magistr: $("#box p:last")[0].scrollIntoView()
[13:38:50] <gnarf> magistr: sorry that you apparently don't understand how objects work
[13:38:58] <systemfault> He's just a clown.
[13:39:01] <ajpiano> gnarf: no, that's jQuery's fault
[13:39:31] <gnarf> it'll be my fault after i kick his condescending attitude out of #jquery
[13:39:41] <ajpiano> not if i do first ;)
[13:40:01] <ajpiano> i've been trying to make a fiddle for the last 10 minutes but the wifi on this train is busted
[13:40:36] <phlp> better than snakes on a train
[13:40:45] <systemfault> ajpiano: Could be worse.. seems you have some kind of IRC bouncer or something so you don't get disconnected every 10 seconds.
[13:40:57] <magistr> <gnarf>  $("#box p:last")[0] is undefined
[13:41:00] <Tant102> ... or the irc server is located on the train!
[13:41:09] <gnarf> magistr: that means you didn't find any elements
[13:41:13] <ajpiano> systemfault: yep... i installed the bouncer after a bad ride ;)
[13:41:16] <systemfault> :P
[13:41:21] <beakybal4> does anyone here use blueimp's uploader?
[13:41:51] <magistr> <gnarf> jquery  didn't find any elements
[13:42:00] <julien_may> is jquery's raw xmpl dump generated based on jsdoc?
[13:42:39] <ajpiano> magistr, scrollIntoView works just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/GeQQX/
[13:42:52] <gnarf> magistr: that means you didn't have anything that matched "#box p:last"
[13:43:00] <ajpiano> julien_may: i don't know :/ which dump are you talking about
[13:43:23] <systemfault> Weird question... I want to learn how to write jquery plugins "properly" so... Anyone would know a super well written one so I could analyze it?
[13:43:25] <julien_may> ajpiano: the one found on the official jquery site: api.jquery.com/api
[13:43:31] <gnarf> julien_may: no - the XML Docs are manually written
[13:43:36] <ajpiano> ^^
[13:43:42] <magistr> <gnarf> but $("#chatbox p:last").css("background-color","red"); works  correctly
[13:43:43] <Tidwell> gnarf: what.... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wikiapi2xml
[13:43:55] <magistr> #box
[13:44:09] <julien_may> gnarf: really? not autogenerated?
[13:44:12] <Tidwell> julien_may: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wikiapi2xml
[13:44:44] <gnarf> Tidwell: that pulls it out of a wordpress DB
[13:44:52] <ajpiano> Tidwell, julien_may, that's for the old mediawiki docs, not api.jquery.com
[13:45:29] <julien_may> hmmm...
[13:45:31] <Tidwell> gnarf: o'rly?  Hrm, the more you know...
[13:45:40] <gnarf> Tidwell: the docs themselves are manually written -- the XML dump might be "generated" from the hundreds of individual docs
[13:45:56] <magistr> <gnarf> How to undуrstand this? your dirty library is works
[13:46:24] <gnarf> magistr: ever hear of a debugger?

[13:46:43] <gnarf> figure shit out
[13:47:04] <gnarf> and if you want help from the experts, it helps not to make fun of their hard work
[13:47:36] <ajpiano> and if you want help, it helps not to ask for it for another 24 hours
[13:47:40] <Tidwell> gnarf: well yea, i assumed that python script just scraped api.jquery and converted it all into xml
[13:47:51] <gnarf> thx ajpiano
[13:48:08] <gnarf> i always feel like a jerk when I do that
[13:48:11] <gnarf> :)
[13:48:16] <systemfault> You shouldn't..
[13:48:55] <systemfault> Anyway, the community is nice here compared to other channels like.. **cough** ##C **cough**
[13:48:56] <gnarf> +q is so mean...
[13:49:11] <gnarf> systemfault: you obviously haven't met snover then? :)
[13:49:30] <systemfault> Doesn't seem to be the case :P
[13:49:44] <gnarf> ajpiano: does the +q go away on its own?
[13:49:49] <ajpiano> gnarf: it gives me this feeling: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Still_Pumped_from_Using_the_Mouse_Cover.jpg
[13:49:50] <ajpiano> :D
[13:50:24] <ajpiano> yeah, all bans are 24h default,
[13:50:28] <ajpiano> eir takes care of it
[13:50:33] <ajpiano> but you can extend it
[13:50:35] <gnarf> nice
[13:51:00] <julien_may> tnx
[13:51:04] <ajpiano> gnarf: at least with +q the person can see how other people manage to get help
[13:51:06] <julien_may> tnx for the info
[13:51:10] <julien_may> see you
[13:51:34] <ajpiano> ;)
[13:53:24] <Rotham> "hi whats up i have a problem...."  usually works
[13:54:04] <Rotham> just takes a few minutes of patience.. and oddly enough I often solve problems within a few minutes of asking for help, even if I have been banging my head against the wall for an hour or 2 on my own :/
[13:55:52] <phlp> he's been here for hours asking the same thing. there's a language barrier
[13:56:12] <p3lim> noob in help here, I need a way to hide an object with the class ".post"
[13:56:33] <Tidwell> p3lim: $('.post').hide()
[13:56:36] <p3lim> in need of help*
[13:56:40] <p3lim> thanks Tidwell
[13:58:16] <ajpiano> or 90 minutes of incoherent insults
[13:58:16] <ajpiano> ...
[13:58:35] <beakybal4> can someone help me please :(
[13:58:43] <gnarf> ?ask @beakybal4
[13:58:43] <bot-t> beakybal4, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:59:01] <beakybal4> i need help with blueimp's jquery uploader
[13:59:11] <systemfault> He might have found help on google in his own language if he looked instead of blaming the damn lib for his failure.
[13:59:29] <p3lim> Tidwell: Didn't seem to work, though I just did a quick test over at w3s
[13:59:54] <gnarf> beakybal4: good luck, you'll probably want to a) provide a jsfiddle example -- see ?p -- b) link us to the source/documentation of the plugin, c) hope that someone cares enough to help you dig :)
[13:59:54] <bot-t> beakybal4, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:00:07] <beakybal4> haha

[14:00:54] <orolo> is there like a if element is visible return true function?
[14:00:55] <beakybal4> thats b)
[14:01:14] <gnarf> orolo: .is(":visible")
[14:01:18] <gnarf> ?:visible

[14:01:20] <Tidwell> p3lim: you need jquery on the page and do it after document ready... if you aren't using jquery then you want document.getElementsByClassName('post')[0].style.display = 'none'; (to do just the first, youd have to iterate over the set and do the style on each one)
[14:01:29] <orolo> thanks.
[14:01:41] <beakybal4> gnarf: can u help me?
[14:01:43] <beakybal4> <3
[14:01:59] <p3lim> Tidwell: Thanks, that explains it. I run jQuery on the final product
[14:02:19] <systemfault> Tidwell: I wouldn't advertise getElementsByClassName though :P
[14:02:30] <systemfault> Tidwell: IE9 and later IIRC :(
[14:02:53] <gnarf> beakybal4: not at the moment, sorry, I really am not in the mood to dig into plugin i'm not gonna use --- also you still haven't mentioned what your problem is ;)
[14:03:03] <beakybal4> no worries ;)
[14:03:04] <beakybal4> well
[14:03:25] <gnarf> im sure one of the other 910 people lurking here might be willing to help though :)
[14:03:26] <beakybal4> it all works as planned, just i want icons to come up next to the file names
[14:03:44] <gnarf> sounds solvable using CSS
[14:04:20] <beakybal4> can i PM you my site so you can see kind of what im talking about?
[14:04:32] <Tidwell> systemfault: yea - truth.  I figured it was just missing jquery anyway
[14:05:04] <gnarf> beakybal4: like i said, not in the mood ;)
[14:05:11] <beakybal4> gnarf: fair enough :)
[14:05:26] <beakybal4> gnarf: go sleep/ drink coffee / take some happy pills :)
[14:05:27] <gnarf> beakybal4: i have my own code to debug ;)
[14:08:17] <Phoenixz> I have a weird slide down animation problem.. When triggered by live('hover', fn) to slide down (mouseover) or up (mouseout), there is no problem.. Also when I trigger the slide down animation manually with $().trigger(event) where event.type = 'mouseover' (do this when showing a <div> as a popup) there is no problem. When I trigger the slide up manually though, with $().trigger(event) where event.type = 'mouseout', nothing happens.. Any ideas on
[14:08:18] <Phoenixz> what I might need to check?
[14:08:50] <agib> does anyone know something like jsfiddle that has SSL?
[14:11:26] <ajpiano> Phoenixz, trigger mouseenter and mouseleave instead of over and out
[14:12:18] <slackz> I'm trying to clone an image element and append it to another div. This works -- but it isn't rendering the new element. Any help with this?
[14:14:03] <agib> what do you mean it works?
[14:14:14] <agib> sounds like it doesn't work
[14:14:39] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[14:14:39] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[14:14:47] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: wtf.... seems to work..
[14:15:08] <ajpiano> Phoenixz, hover wraps the mouseenter and mouseleave events, not mouseover and mouseout
[14:15:09] <gnarf> Phoenixz: hover is mouseenter/mouseleave not mouseover/mouseout
[14:15:50] <gnarf> mouseover/mouseout happen multiple times - even within an element, the over/out of children elements, etc.... enter/leave only fire for entering and leaving the element
[14:15:54] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: gnarf: What is the difference between the two? (mouseenter / mouseover, and mouseout and mouseleave)
[14:16:00] <beakybal4> thanks gnarf :)
[14:16:01] <beakybal4> <3
[14:16:03] <beakybal4> bye all
[14:16:38] <huglester> Hello everyone. I've been using the: http://mondaybynoon.com/2009/02/23/creating-custom-form-elements-using-jquery-selects/ to styling the html > select forms...
[14:16:38] <huglester> but Today I needed to use optgroup in the select .. and this library does not support this:( maybe there is smth laying aroudn supporting this?
[14:16:58] <Phoenixz> gnarf: thanks, I was too slow :)
[14:17:36] <ajpiano> huglester, as we say in the business... "thems the breaks"
[14:18:04] <ajpiano> doesn't look like the plugin thinks about the existence of optgroups at all
[14:18:04] <ajpiano> you could tweak it to make it do so
[14:18:46] <huglester> ajpiano: yeah.. it doesn't support it, the codedoes not look at this 'section' at all:) so yes, probably I'll need to introduce it myself
[14:19:06] <slackz> nevermind, got's it. I forgot I could only have 2 event handlers on .hover. lol.
[14:22:29] <Phoenixz> ajpiano: Question.. If hover wraps the mouseenter and mouseleave events.. then why am I getting event.type=mouseover and mouseout when I move the mouse over the <div>?
[14:22:39] <ajpiano> i think it's a bug in 1.6
[14:22:58] <gnarf> Phoenixz: are you on 1.6.1 ?
[14:27:01] <Phoenixz> gnarf: 1.5..... 1 or 2, not sure.. :)
[14:30:06] <Techdeck> hey guys, is there a built-in tooltip kinda mechanism into jquery?
[14:31:53] <GeoDud> no, but there are a billion tooltip plugins
[14:33:26] <Phoenixz> gnarf: May this be related to jQuery 1.5.x?
[14:33:38] <gnarf> Phoenixz: don't really know...
[14:34:17] <d4rklit3> hey
[14:34:26] <d4rklit3> i have an iframe on my page which im hosting on the same domain
[14:34:35] <d4rklit3> can i drill down its contents
[14:34:38] <d4rklit3> w/ jquery?
[14:34:52] <d4rklit3> for example $("#navigation iframe")
[14:34:55] <d4rklit3> is the iframe
[14:35:10] <d4rklit3> can i do $("#navigation iframe #mainnav")
[14:35:17] <pifantastic> d4rklit3: $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#navigation iframe").contents()
[14:35:24] <pifantastic> ?contents @ d4rklit3

[14:35:53] <dserban> Hi.  I need a little bit of hand-holding, so being forewarned, what I want to do, is use colorbox to open an inline dialog for logging in.  On submit, I need to trigger a call to a script which checks the supplied variables and then on success, modify the parent page.  Is this within the realm of possibility of colorbox/jquery calls?
[14:35:53] <pifantastic> d4rklit3: ignore how colloquy munged my message
[14:35:54] <d4rklit3> pifantastic: i need to provide the urk?
[14:35:57] <d4rklit3> oo ok
[14:35:57] <d4rklit3> he
[14:36:09] <d4rklit3> can i do
[14:36:13] <d4rklit3> err
[14:36:14] <dserban> I've done _some_ jquery stuff, but by no means proficient, so if you hate noobs, ignore me :)
[14:36:56] <djQuery> ?sop@dserban
[14:36:57] <bot-t> dserban, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[14:37:04] <pifantastic> dserban: I could suggest creating a minimal implementation with jsfiddle that we can help you with
[14:37:23] <d4rklit3> pifantastic:    var frameContents = $("#navigation iframe").contents();    so how would i get #mainnav from frameContents?
[14:37:49] <pifantastic> $('#navigation iframe).contents().find('#mainnav');
[14:38:34] <dserban> djQuery: I'm sorry, is not what I described from the same origin?  The parent page calls the colorbox dialog, then gets updated on success?
[14:39:06] <dserban> pifantastic: jsfiddle?  I need to google :)
[14:39:31] <pifantastic> dserban: read the topic
[14:39:45] <djQuery> dserban: dont know u didnt specify where the iframe was pointed to
[14:40:43] <dserban> pifantastic: aye, gettin' in there.
[14:40:55] <huglester> ajpiano: thanks for insipiration, I'm already doing some progress :)
[14:41:12] <ajpiano> \o/
[14:41:20] <dserban> djQuery: inline code, just takes a display:none div and enables it in the colorbox frame, same document.
[14:41:24] <d4rklit3> thank goodness for jquery
[14:41:26] <d4rklit3> just saved my ass
[14:43:38] <geestring> I'm using a plugin that let's you animate borderTopColor and change its opacity using rgba. But how would I initially set the rgba of my borders?
[14:44:05] <Tidwell> geestring: http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/
[14:45:11] <huglester> hm... how do I check if <select> is inside the <optgroup> ?
[14:45:23] <geestring> Tidwell thanks!
[14:45:34] <ajpiano> huglester: you mean if there's an optgroup inside the select?
[14:46:07] <huglester> ajpiano: I mean I wanna check if  current 'select' is a child of <optgroup>
[14:46:38] <ajpiano> it's completely invalid for there to be a select inside of an optgroup
[14:46:43] <ajpiano> do you mean an option?
[14:46:44] <mcnellis> How can I get the node of a jquery object? e.g. <span id="#foo">foo</span> and then my JS to select it is $('#foo') but I want it as a node not jquery object
[14:46:59] <ajpiano> mcnellis $("#foo")[0] or $("#foo").get(0)
[14:47:02] <pifantastic> ajpiano: I think he means the selected option
[14:47:09] <ajpiano> pifantastic, olol
[14:47:21] <ajpiano> $("option:selected").closest("optgroup").length
[14:47:35] <mcnellis> thanks ajpiano
[14:47:45] <gnarf> looking for people to play with this: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ -- need testing!!! :)
[14:47:46] <huglester> ajpiano: ah yes.. if the 'option' is che child of 'optgroup' :))) sorry
[14:47:57] <ajpiano> ah ^^
[14:48:22] <huglester> ajpiano: :)))
[14:49:15] <huglester> ajpiano: it works! thank you very much!
[14:49:44] <huglester> with such support, I almost have fully working .js with optgroup support for enchancing select box :)

[14:59:00] <Chilaquiles> hey guys, anybody that can help me with showing an error message after I click a button and I make a check in a file check.php
[14:59:27] <Chilaquiles> I want to show the error message in the same page but I haven't been able
[14:59:30] <Chilaquiles> any suggestions?
[15:00:06] <thomedy130> okay i have built  my tabs and got my jquery to work
[15:00:31] <thomedy130> i don't know which one selector to choose to make it right
[15:01:10] <thomedy130> its an <div><ul><li><a>
[15:01:17] <thomedy130> iv tried a few combinations
[15:01:24] <thomedy130> it might help to have a link
[15:01:41] <thomedy130> www.thomedy.com/lclayout-1/index.html
[15:03:19] <amid_hasan> thomedy130: what are you trying to do?
[15:03:46] <thomedy130> im trying to make whatever tab im hovering over to expand its width 10px and then back when i leave
[15:05:51] <amid_hasan> You can do hover method on the links
[15:05:59] <amid_hasan> I just created a fiddle, uno momento
[15:06:19] <thomedy130> i was looking over that but it seems to just do the same thing i did since it needs the enter/leave handle anyways... and thank you for the jsfiddle
[15:07:42] <orolo> on page refresh, my bindings work; but when the page is locally navigated to, some stuff isn't working right. how do i debug for what is still 'bound'?
[15:08:35] <amid_hasan> thomedy: http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/arffz/3/
[15:08:39] <amid_hasan> does that work for you
[15:08:50] <thomedy130> okay ltet me look at it one sec
[15:09:07] <amid_hasan> My bad: try this updated one
[15:09:07] <amid_hasan> http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/arffz/4/
[15:09:23] <amid_hasan> I think its a similar effect to what you're trying to do
[15:10:08] <amid_hasan> orolo: firebug
[15:10:12] <phlp> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/8SbmC/30
[15:10:23] <thomedy130> how important is document.ready
[15:10:39] <amid_hasan> ph1p: this works perfectly. thanks!!
[15:10:59] <Chilaquiles> hey
[15:11:04] <Chilaquiles> nobody can help me?
[15:11:07] <Chilaquiles> wow
[15:11:22] <amid_hasan> thomedy: very important. you can mess up your page if you don't check that document is ready
[15:11:42] <amid_hasan> thomedy: to initialize jquery simply use the populat $(function(){ // code here});
[15:11:49] <thomedy130> i only ask cuz its not on yours... yours works better and i always do it and im new
[15:12:53] <amid_hasan> how are you calling jquery thomedy130?
[15:14:14] <thomedy130> im not sure if im answering the correct question but basically i don't loaded t and then include it externally.... that doesn't feel like the answer to the right qustion though
[15:14:14] <amid_hasan> Chilaquiles, what is your situation?
[15:15:02] <amid_hasan> If you load externally, one way to load is in original page for HTML5: <script src="location/of/js.js"></script>
[15:15:21] <amid_hasan> The external jquery page must check that document is ready before it executes your js
[15:15:22] <amid_hasan> so
[15:15:43] <Chilaquiles> I want to know if its possible to have a button in one page and then after pressing the button depending on what the user typed print an error message or a success message
[15:15:53] <amid_hasan> $(document.ready(function(){ //code here})); or $(function(){ // code here});
[15:16:10] <amid_hasan> Chilaquiles: yes possible
[15:16:23] <amid_hasan> Code you have now, please paste in jsfiddle.net
[15:16:33] <Chilaquiles> mine?
[15:16:48] <thomedy130> oh i just realized that when you are using the hover the function expects it in the order mouse enter mouse leave
[15:17:13] <thomedy130> i thought i had to use the hover and still use mouse enter mouse leave as paramters which is why i didn't even see a point it seemed like extra code
[15:17:27] <thomedy130> cool let me see what i can do with my code and the brb
[15:17:31] <amid_hasan> yes, the hover includes two anonymous functions inside: first part is onMouseOver type, and second is onMouseOut
[15:17:53] <Chilaquiles> ?
[15:17:57] <amid_hasan> thomedy: use hover() method it's simpler.http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[15:18:21] <thomedy130> absolutely i just misread the docs
[15:18:25] <thomedy130> and thank you
[15:18:38] <nerk> hey, is there any known issue with $(_form).serializeArray(); in IE?
[15:19:02] <amid_hasan> thomedy130: you're welcome.
[15:19:05] <thomedy130> should all jquery work with ie
[15:19:11] <thomedy130> crossbrowser
[15:19:12] <thomedy130> and what not
[15:19:20] <nerk> I have a form that ajax submits.. works in all browsers except IE, and it appears to be a problem with serializeArray();  .. it collects nothing from the form
[15:19:34] <thomedy130> i had to write a seperate style sheet for ie i just found taht out cuz as you can tell im new
[15:19:47] <d4rklit3> anyone use this Date.js class? im trying to do somethign like date = Date.parse(database DateTime entry)  then trying to check date.is().today()
[15:19:53] <nerk> but the $(_form) call does return the form element properly
[15:19:55] <d4rklit3> but i can't seem to get it to work with any of their methods :(
[15:20:51] <nerk> that is weird syntax
[15:21:05] <nerk> sure it's not date.is(date.today()) or something?
[15:21:24] <d4rklit3> o hmm
[15:21:28] <nerk> or like date.is('today') ?
[15:21:46] <danniel> hi
[15:21:51] <d4rklit3> yeah mybe
[15:21:52] <amid_hasan> hello danniel
[15:22:29] <danniel> how can I show an alert when have new content?
[15:22:40] <d4rklit3> none of that works
[15:22:42] <thomedy130> is there  a rule to know when to put animate into a anonymous function or is that just how hover expects it
[15:22:43] <d4rklit3> their docs are weird
[15:22:51] <d4rklit3> you can do stuff like date.is().monday()
[15:23:06] <danniel> i'm needing to show one visual indicator in posts page when user posts a new comment
[15:23:36] <danniel> it's a list of posts titles
[15:28:36] <d4rklit3> now i know something is wrong Date.compare is not a function
[15:28:37] <d4rklit3> wtf
[15:28:44] <lmao25> hey everyone, how come my p.1 element only UPDATES one time ? i need it to refresh the html inside the div everytime i do a keypress : http://pastebin.com/h88B6pSw
[15:30:46] <nguyendh> i have sForm.find('input').each(function() { //do something })). i want the same thing for 'select'. how do i do that within 1 line
[15:31:19] <GeoDud> @lmao25 isn't your php statement only evaluated once, when the page is served to the browser? the time will never be updated
[15:31:39] <lmao25> is there a javascript eqiv?
[15:31:47] <ionico> how can i change this like in order to change .currency class name,  by the name atributte of an input wich is inside a div with an id name??  $(".currency").keyup(function()
[15:32:07] <GeoDud> @lmao25 look into http://www.datejs.com/
[15:32:29] <GeoDud> @lmao25 shouldn't need to bind the updating of the date to a keypress though
[15:38:18] <mdsdss> Hi, I'm trying to figure out why I'm not able to add these elements horizontally after a number of width of the container has reached, but I have overflow:scroll as a css attribute : http://jsfiddle.net/UxCPA/1/
[15:40:38] <d4rklit3> seriously wtfi s with date.js
[15:42:04] <amid_hasan> simple question: how do i get current date with jQuery and format as Fri 6/3/2011 ?
[15:42:47] <GeoDud> http://www.datejs.com/
[15:43:17] <djQuery> amid_hasan: formating dates has noting to do with jquery. see ?javascript format date
[15:43:18] <bot-t> amid_hasan, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[15:43:25] <d4rklit3> GeoDud: i can't use any of those methods
[15:43:30] <d4rklit3> they aren't to clear on what files u need
[15:43:44] <d4rklit3> im reading the docs, and its like Date.compare()  it works..     but not for me
[15:45:11] <ajpiano> ?eval var d = new Date(); (d.getMonth()+1) + "/" + d.getDate() + "/" + d.getFullYear();
[15:45:11] <bot-t> ajpiano: "6/4/2011"
[15:45:30] <ajpiano> amid_hasan: ^^
[15:47:01] <DoctorDarren> Gentlemen, I have a grid made with 10x10 droppables, and a draggable which spans across a few of these droppables. What would be the best way to find out the left-most grid cell covered by the draggable when it's being dragged?
[15:47:17] <d4rklit3> where the hell is datejs latest
[15:47:19] <d4rklit3> this is fucked
[15:49:27] <d4rklit3> date.js is a fucking liar!
[15:50:17] <orolo> i need to do if $(variable).text() contains("foobar") == true {}
[15:51:27] <orolo> how do i add the :contains filter to a non-quoted object?
[15:51:42] <orolo> $(thisIsVarariable:contains)?
[15:51:54] <amid_hasan> followup, how do you get date using javascript and format to look like Fri 6/3/2011?
[15:52:46] <BinaryKitten> orolo you can't
[15:52:55] <BinaryKitten> jquery contains is for elements
[15:53:02] <BinaryKitten> what you need to use is indexOf
[15:53:10] <BinaryKitten> ?mdc indexOf @ orolo
[15:53:11] <bot-t> orolo, indexOf - MDC Docs - Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[15:53:29] <orolo> thanks.
[15:53:30] <BinaryKitten> hey paul
[15:57:57] <mdsdss> anyone ?
[15:59:12] <mdsdss> I need add elements hoziontally beyond the containers width (with overflow set to scroll), but this is just wrapping the elements:http://jsfiddle.net/UxCPA/1/
[15:59:53] <graphikz> hey I was wondering why http://pastie.org/private/n7hgcc3vjamvvly9hmid0w doesn't work right
[16:00:07] <graphikz> it works when I throw alerts in to split it up
[16:00:15] <graphikz> without the alerts it doesn't work
[16:00:34] <thomedy130> i freakin finally did it
[16:00:39] <thomedy130> okay it took me slowin down again and then
[16:00:43] <thomedy130> now i got my tabs
[16:00:47] <thomedy130> yay
[16:01:18] <amid_hasan> thomedy130: the tabs work as you want them to?
[16:01:21] <amid_hasan> what edits did you make
[16:01:23] <thomedy130> yep
[16:02:39] <thomedy130> basically i just did the hover and then went to the docs and wrote it myself
[16:03:00] <thomedy130> but i wouldn't hav eknown about the hovers being not crazy as ithought
[16:03:20] <thomedy130> thnak you
[16:03:55] <amid_hasan> you can add different effects using animate without writing lots of code
[16:04:15] <thomedy130> im huge fan of jquery i found you can do ajax with it
[16:04:27] <thomedy130> not now theough ill get to that later
[16:04:44] <amid_hasan> thomedy130: do you know of any good ajax/jquery tuts, vids, sandboxes?
[16:04:52] <amid_hasan> trying to master that part now
[16:05:13] <thomedy130> nope never done that yet i just found out you can even do that but ill get to it soon
[16:05:54] <mustalac> hey all is there an easy way to fire a trigger when an element is added to the dom?
[16:06:36] <BinaryKitten> mustalac what are you actually wanting to do
[16:07:28] <mustalac> on page load an ajax request is made...and the result is inserted into the dom...i need to know when that has occured (and i dont have access to the .ajax callback)
[16:08:06] <BinaryKitten> mustalac unfortunately there is not a way to do that
[16:08:18] <BinaryKitten> you could use promises to hook onto the ajax request
[16:08:41] <BinaryKitten> and you can Bind to elements that are yet to be in the dom (with live and delegate)
[16:08:44] <graphikz> can there only be one animate going on at once?
[16:09:30] <BinaryKitten> graphikz depends on browser, element, computer etc
[16:09:32] <mustalac> BinaryKitten ya...i'll play around...thx
[16:10:58] <graphikz> ohh I know why it's not working
[16:11:10] <graphikz> can I label an animation event?
[16:11:17] <graphikz> so I can stop one and keep the other going
[16:12:00] <BinaryKitten> on the same element graphikz?
[16:12:10] <graphikz> yeah
[16:12:22] <BinaryKitten> animation gets queued on the same element
[16:12:44] <BinaryKitten> there are queue manipulators in jquery though..
[16:12:49] <graphikz> I have one animation that calls a stop which cancels the other
[16:12:51] <BinaryKitten> ?dequeue
[16:12:52] <bot-t> .dequeue([queueName]): Execute the next function on the queue for the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/dequeue/
[16:13:08] <BinaryKitten> stop will stop all
[16:13:20] <BinaryKitten> bare with me, need to check docs
[16:14:05] <JSBracher> Hello everyone - I have a weird problem - I have a form, in the submit function is a validation function using the validation plugin, validation fails (on purpose for testing) but weirdly, the form still submits.
[16:15:19] <JSBracher> Here is a link to the code: http://jsfiddle.net/jsbracher/Aq5uB/4/
[16:16:16] <BinaryKitten> graphikz try .dequeue
[16:16:23] <graphikz> yeah trying that now
[16:16:28] <graphikz> seems to be working h/o
[16:16:36] <BinaryKitten> JSBracher is the form submit got a name
[16:17:11] <ThiefMaster> buildParams( prefix + "[" + ( typeof v === "object" || jQuery.isArray(v) ? i : "" ) + "]", v, traditional, add );
[16:17:14] <ThiefMaster> i'd like to shoot someone for this.
[16:17:33] <ThiefMaster> not everyone is using PHP which expects blah[] for arrays in GET/POST data
[16:17:33] <JSBracher> BinaryKitten - yes.
[16:17:46] <JSBracher> $("#volunteerBasicQuestions").submit( function() {
[16:17:53] <BinaryKitten> JSBracher does that form submit button have a name...
[16:18:06] <BinaryKitten> is that name "submit"
[16:18:28] <JSBracher> the button doesn't have a name.
[16:18:42] <JSBracher> oh wait, yes and yes
[16:18:44] <JSBracher> duh.
[16:19:01] <JSBracher> <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Register for Studies" class="button" />
[16:19:48] <JSJunkie> hey...
[16:20:09] <JSJunkie> just one little question. Does something like $(this>:first-child) work?
[16:20:51] <graphikz> yup that worked
[16:20:52] <graphikz> thanks
[16:21:16] <JSJunkie> anyone?
[16:21:50] <phlp> JSJunkie, $(this).children().first()
[16:22:15] <JSJunkie> oh... there's another way? :/ lol
[16:22:15] <Kit-10> JSJunkie  $(':first-child', this)
[16:22:20] <JSJunkie> oh
[16:22:32] <JSJunkie> what about first-child:first-child?
[16:22:39] <Kit-10> $('selector', LimitSearchToThis)
[16:22:52] <Kit-10> JSJunkie  $(':first-child :first-child', this)
[16:22:53] <phlp> there's tons of ways http://jsperf.com/jquery-first-child-selection-performance/3
[16:23:04] <JSJunkie> thanks :D ^_^
[16:23:10] <Kit-10> but really you start to get bad ways like that
[16:23:20] <Kit-10> look at phlp's suggestion url
[16:24:13] <Kit-10> phlp  http://jsperf.com/jquery-first-child-selection-performance/4 as an update
[16:28:19] <systemfault> So.. forget the useless jquery shortcuts if you want performance?
[16:28:30] <systemfault> Why does :first exists?
[16:30:14] <amid_hasan> What could I add in jQuery to make a dental appointment booking system simply easy to use?
[16:30:42] <fealls> a cool date selector?
[16:30:50] <fealls> :p
[16:31:35] <phlp> "While [:first] matches only a single element, :first-child can match more than one: One for each parent." http://api.jquery.com/first-selector
[16:31:59] <ajpiano> JSJunkie, fyi, the first the first doesn't work is because of see ?concatobj
[16:32:00] <bot-t> JSJunkie, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[16:32:29] <JSJunkie> oh...thanks :)
[16:33:48] <amid_hasan> fealls: do you think the system that's on www.zocdoc.com works?
[16:33:53] <ionico> how can i reach an element by its name atribute ??
[16:34:07] <systemfault> [name="foo"]
[16:34:26] <systemfault> If you know the type of the element, prepend it.
[16:34:29] <systemfault> p[name="foo"]
[16:34:42] <ionico> it is an input
[16:34:49] <systemfault> ionico: Same thing
[16:35:00] <systemfault> input[type="checkbox"][name="foo"]
[16:35:06] <systemfault> But jQuery has a shortcut IIRC
[16:35:19] <phlp> :checkbox[name="foo"]
[16:35:23] <systemfault> ^^
[16:35:29] <dabear> dont use it
[16:35:39] <dabear> :checkbox is slower, always
[16:36:03] <dabear> ":checkbox" is the same as "*:checkbox"
[16:36:25] <dabear> which means getting all elements, then finding which of those are checkboxes
[16:36:30] <ionico> i vane this: $(".currency").each(function()   i want tho chanhe .currenci  for the input named first <div id=p1><input name=firts>
[16:36:38] <dabear> at least use input:checkbox
[16:37:19] <systemfault> dabear: What other element can be a checkbox? :/
[16:37:25] <systemfault> That's a weird behavior
[16:37:35] <ajpiano> systemfault, that's not the point though
[16:37:35] <dabear> $("#p1 input[name='firts']")
[16:37:52] <lmao25> is there a CHAR limit on how long strings can be in jquery/javascript?
[16:37:53] <ajpiano> systemfault, :checkbox is just a shortcut to check the type attr of all the elements in the sit
[16:37:54] <ajpiano> set*
[16:38:08] <systemfault> ajpiano: Ah! Thanks for the clarification :)
[16:38:12] <ajpiano> therefore, if all you pass is :checkbox, it's gonna get every element, and then check its type property
[16:38:22] <ajpiano> :)
[16:38:22] <systemfault> Makes sense
[16:38:23] <dabear> didn't I say that?
[16:38:27] <dabear> oh, well :/
[16:38:32] <systemfault> dabear: :'(

[16:44:46] <ajpiano> lmao25, you have to use replaceWith with an element, not a simple data type
[16:45:21] <ajpiano> (like a number)
[16:47:09] <lmao25> ajpiano, how do i replace all the contents in <p class"1"></p> ?

[16:53:47] <LakWork> i have 3 people in my office getting 'File Not Found' in firefox but not any other browser
[16:53:51] <LakWork> which version of ff are you on?
[16:54:55] <phlp> not found on ff 3.6.17
[16:55:05] <LakWork> ok
[16:55:06] <ajpiano> i'm on firefox chrome edition
[16:55:09] <ajpiano> it's ... chrome
[16:55:10] <ajpiano> :p
[16:55:11] <LakWork> lol
[16:55:14] <LakWork> jackass
[16:55:24] <LakWork> so it is a consistent problem
[16:55:27] <phlp> works on chromium
[16:55:40] <LakWork> what in gods name would cause firefox to file not found on the .json extension?
[16:55:50] <LakWork> it seems to be specifically that
[16:56:02] <phlp> you doing something with the user-agent?
[16:56:05] <LakWork> nope
[16:56:10] <LakWork> nothing at all
[16:59:12] <phlp> LakWork, wait was ajpiano's json what you were expecting or is that the not found?
[16:59:45] <ionico> what is the problem with this? $("input[name='precio_t']").each(function() {
[16:59:45] <ionico> 							add += Number(getNumber($(this).val()));
[17:00:29] <ionico> it must sum all inputs named precio_t

[17:07:13] <LakWork> phlp the json ajpiano posted is what *should* output, but firefox produces file not found for no obvious reason
[17:10:06] <phlp> could be the 401 status code. maybe firefox doesnt show the response if it's unauthorized?
[17:12:55] <Phiphel> Hi. Is there a way to make JqUI "droppable" accept more than one selector? I tried [type~="1 2"] it doesn't work. I want the first div to be able to accept type=1 and 2. Here's the simplified code http://pastebin.com/AaSjdS2T
[17:14:21] <phlp> 'div[type="1"], div[type="2"]'
[17:15:52] <Phiphel> phlp; thanks. It works. :)
[17:15:58] <phlp> np :)
[17:16:17] <jspeaks> ajpiano i am still looking at my code scratching my head... the div shown in my debugger is the div that contains the attributes defined by my object, yet the custom method is not present...  could you provide any additional feedback to get me going?
[17:16:35] <ajpiano> jspeaks, the dom element becomes the context when you do delegate
[17:16:41] <ajpiano> so 'this' doesn't point to the element anymore
[17:17:29] <ajpiano> oh wait
[17:17:44] <jspeaks> ajpiano, but doesn't $(this) reassociate it?
[17:19:05] <ajpiano> no, it just creates a a new jquery object wrapping that dom element
[17:19:46] <ajpiano> that dom element doesn't know anything about the "me" that created it, unfortunately
[17:21:58] <jspeaks> do you know of an example of creating domain specific objects with extended methods like i am trying to do that still maintain the ability to be added to another jquery object via something like append?
[17:22:27] <ajpiano> the jquery ui widget factory supports that
[17:22:51] <ajpiano> but so does simply associating the object instance with the dom element using jQuery.data
[17:22:53] <jspeaks> yeah... i went that route at first but i don't see these objects as widgets
[17:22:53] <ajpiano> ?data
[17:22:54] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:23:07] <ajpiano> so yea, just link the objects in data
[17:23:45] <jspeaks> hmm... ok... let me noodle on that a while... seems kinda sucky
[17:24:15] <ajpiano> well, it's based on the idea that you shouldn't be attached arbitarry methods and properties to DOM elements directly
[17:24:24] <ajpiano> and it's actualyl relatively elegant imo
[17:25:09] <jspeaks> so is there a reciepe/pattern for custom object development using jquery?
[17:25:20] <phlp> http://jsfiddle.net/dZekN/1
[17:25:32] <blub_republic> hi
[17:28:22] <ajpiano> jspeaks, i'm telling you, data is the way to go here :)
[17:28:29] <blub_republic> jquery validator is fucking sick
[17:28:45] <coldhead> it needs medical attention?
[17:28:46] <ajpiano> you can create all the relationships you need between objects and elements etc etc
[17:30:06] <blub_republic> fuk
[17:30:36] <jspeaks> ok... i accept your response... thanks for helping me find a solution... i am kinda disappointed that I have to leverage .data to create custom methods, but i accept that it is the manner to achieve the result using jquery
[17:30:46] <jspeaks> thx phlp too
[17:30:56] <ajpiano> jspeaks, you should just link the actual object itself
[17:31:02] <ajpiano> not a bunch of anonymous function
[17:31:10] <jspeaks> ?
[17:31:21] <phlp> yeah dont go by what i did that was a one time deal for me
[17:31:24] <ajpiano> jspeaks: so basically, when you write OOP
[17:31:40] <ajpiano> you have to think about the objects as being more important than the DOM elements that represent them
[17:31:51] <ajpiano> so the dog.chow thing, should return a dog, not a jquery
[17:32:06] <ajpiano> and then it has a property that is the jquery that wraps the element
[17:32:08] <jspeaks> sure... i went that route but what do i do when i get to an append?
[17:32:20] <jspeaks> dog.getElement()
[17:32:27] <ajpiano> you do kennel.append(chow.element);
[17:32:36] <ajpiano> yeah, you don't even have to have getters for it if you don't want
[17:32:45] <ajpiano> and then, in the delegate handler
[17:32:57] <ajpiano> you do $(this).data("dog").bark();
[17:33:19] <ajpiano> this way you're always operating on the dog object itself, and the dog obj can like, do stuff to the element that represents it in the dom
[17:33:28] <ajpiano> i hope that was not too obtuse, i have to go in the shower
[17:33:52] <psilo2> ew, don't go in the shower!
[17:34:07] <ajpiano> blammo!
[17:34:14] <amid_hasan> i havent taken shower yet
[17:34:21] <amid_hasan> i guess i am a normal coder
[17:34:24] <psilo2> well I won't lie, I go in the shower sometimes
[17:34:33] <dabear> it should come as no surprise that ajpiano regularly operates on dogs
[17:34:34] <jspeaks> ok... my real code is kinda implemented like that, but i hated seeing the .element around... you made me feel better re your response and my implementation.... i will chase it down... thx again
[17:34:41] <dabear> so he knows what he's sayin'
[17:34:44] <amid_hasan> wake up, get on the computer, code, forget what time it is, realize i stink, take a shower
[17:34:52] <ajpiano> jspeaks: that's good news then :)
[17:35:02] <jspeaks> thx.. u guys rock
[17:35:05] <jspeaks> ttyl
[17:35:33] <ajpiano> jspeaks
[17:35:38] <ajpiano> the reason it's better than the way you were trying
[17:35:43] <ajpiano> is that like, jquery objects come and go
[17:35:54] <ajpiano> so attaching properties to the jquery object and having it control the element
[17:36:04] <ajpiano> the object instance*
[17:36:24] <ajpiano> is obviously brittle, cause $(wrap)ing it again is obvs brittle
[17:36:24] <ajpiano> ok
[17:36:30] <jspeaks> k
[17:36:49] <ajpiano> cool, good luck

[19:00:23] <babonk> Is there a way to use jQuery selectors on a javascript array?
[19:03:21] <jonathansampson> babonk: What do you mean?
[19:03:44] <gnarf> babonk: you can pass an array of elements to $()
[19:03:54] <gnarf> then .filter() it
[19:04:32] <jonathansampson> gnarf: That's what I thought he might of meant, although his question was different.
[19:04:52] <jonathansampson> Are you in here 24/7? :)
[19:04:54] <babonk> I want to get the indexes in a javascript array which match a certain criteria (using the selector)
[19:05:10] <gnarf> babonk: is the array containing elements?
[19:05:22] <babonk> gnarf: no i think it will just be data
[19:05:32] <babonk> a multi dimensional array
[19:05:48] <gnarf> then wtf are selectors gonna help with?
[19:06:12] <gnarf> you can decorate ANY array with jquery
[19:06:37] <gnarf> ?js $( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ).filter(function() { return this > 2 } ).get();
[19:06:38] <bot-t> gnarf: [3, 4]
[19:06:54] <gnarf> but selectors aren't gonna work on things that aren't DOM elements
[19:06:59] <babonk> ok
[19:07:14] <babonk> so in this case itd be best just to loop through and build the array of elements?
[19:07:32] <gnarf> ?js $( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ).map( function() { return { orig: this, omg: this * 2 } } ).get();
[19:07:33] <bot-t> gnarf: [{"orig": 1, "omg": 2}, {"orig": 2, "omg": 4}, {"orig": 3, "omg": 6}, {"orig": 4, "omg": 8}]
[19:08:19] <gnarf> i have no idea what case you're asking about babonk - you have been pretty vague in your description of your problem
[19:08:21] <gnarf> see ?p
[19:08:21] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[19:08:42] <gnarf> jonathansampson: me?
[19:08:50] <babonk> fair enough.. i asked too early, i should figure out exactly what this array will look like
[19:09:00] <gnarf> jonathansampson: my client is connected 24/7
[19:09:29] <jonathansampson> gnarf: Is your person connected 24/7 as well? :)

[19:19:23] <jonathansampson> Nice. Forgive the spelling - iPad sucks.

[19:21:34] <draginx> O_o
[19:21:42] <draginx> hquery ui should be jquery ui though
[19:22:30] <draginx> when it goes to a <input> field it works O_o
[19:22:32] <draginx> but not an img
[19:22:45] <gnarf> draginx: right

[19:33:23] <ebryn> Should I be able to create jQuery UI widgets in 1.8.x by using: jQuery.ui['widget_name'](options, element)? Works in 1.9...

[19:35:50] <gnarf> ebryn: thats part of the 1.9 api
[19:35:56] <gnarf> ebryn: and widget factory
[19:35:57] <gnarf> i think
[19:36:12] <gnarf> even in current dev 1.9 branch, there are still a few widgets not using widget factory yet
[19:36:23] <ebryn> gnarf: OK thanks, got a suggestion for how to something similar in 1.8?
[19:36:39] <gnarf> ebryn: $(element).widgetname()
[19:36:46] <ebryn> :P
[19:36:52] <ebryn> is that the only way?

[20:23:42] <aferw> hi does jquery have a array functions ?
[20:24:18] <aferw> for example passing my array with a current index possition to a new index possition ?
[20:24:40] <aferw> Basically I want to move the elements from one index position to another
[20:26:05] <jrockjiggz> aferw: look into eq
[20:26:07] <jrockjiggz> ?eq
[20:26:08] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[20:26:23] <Techdeck> do you sometimes wish you would die?
[20:26:24] <Techdeck> meh
[20:26:37] <jrockjiggz> e.g. $('ul').find('li').eq(1) will select the 2nd li
[20:26:47] <jrockjiggz> Techdeck: no
[20:27:01] <Techdeck> then you obviously can't help me with jqgrid
[20:27:03] <Techdeck> :P
[20:27:06] <jrockjiggz> lol
[20:27:08] <jrockjiggz> nope
[20:27:53] <aferw> jrockjiggz: I don't think that will help, unless it works with an array i.e var myArr = []; myArr [0] ="asdasd";
[20:27:56] <Techdeck> oh well
[20:28:01] <Techdeck> any news about jquery mobile?
[20:28:07] <Techdeck> when will it release? I can't wait
[20:31:05] <jrockjiggz> aferw: what is 'asdasd'?
[20:31:07] <dserban> What do I do to change the text in an anchor?  $('a.class').text = data.whatever?
[20:31:21] <jrockjiggz> .text('whatever')
[20:31:42] <dserban> ahh, that's where I went wrong.  This syntax is owning me :)
[20:32:02] <aferw> jrockjiggz : just a text string
[20:32:36] <jrockjiggz> aferw, so you want to insert el.eq( arrayIndex ) ?
[20:33:24] <jrockjiggz> foreach( array, function(i){ $('ul').find('li').eq(i).text( array[i] ); });
[20:33:51] <jrockjiggz> sorry i wrote that wrong
[20:33:52] <aferw> basically I want an array object representation of a sortable list, when the sortable list is moved I want the array to be updated
[20:35:19] <jrockjiggz> you would need to correspond with the sort. manipulate the array accordingly
[20:35:44] <jrockjiggz> you can find the new position with $('li').index()
[20:37:24] <aferw> jrockjiggz: yeah, I wanted find out whether jquery has array manipulation functions ?
[20:39:08] <jrockjiggz> aferw: jQuery has very limited array functions since JavaScript has most of them itself. But here are the ones they have: http://api.jquery.com/category/utilities/
[20:39:33] <aferw> jrockjiggz ok thanks
[21:13:41] <ionico> how can i sum two inputs by the name atribute ?

[21:53:48] <JCP|2> Hi, I have a question. I've developed a plugin a while ago that I use when I'm developing the font-end while the back-end isn't done yet. I can basically "fake" any ajax call with a JSON object I've previously choosed.
[21:54:25] <coldhead> that's not a question
[21:54:27] <JCP|2> The way I'm doing it is by extending the getJSON method that return my object instead of doing the $.get behind.
[21:54:38] <coldhead> ah, go on!
[21:54:43] <JCP|2> Is there another way then extending the function? I am not totally aware of the new ajax functions available since 1.5.*
[21:55:13] <JCP|2> But I thought we could do that using ajaxSetup or something
[21:55:42] <coldhead> i don't know about that
[21:56:09] <JCP|2> I'm looking for the reference
[21:56:18] <coldhead> but you might be breaking things with your getJSON because it probably doesn't support promises and deferrereds
[21:56:34] <JCP|2> I might just have misread the changes in the 1.5.*
[21:56:54] <coldhead> the changes were a complete rewrite
[21:56:58] <coldhead> and a bunch of new stuff
[21:57:04] <coldhead> but it should be backwards compatible
[21:57:25] <JCP|2> My plugin works well. But I just dont want to do something that I can do it "internally" with the new features
[21:57:28] <coldhead> i know very little about the internals sorry
[21:58:20] <JCP|2> Aight no problem. But I am still looking for methods in the documentation
[21:58:50] <coldhead> JCP|2: you might wanna read the source
[21:58:54] <coldhead> it's pretty readable
[21:59:13] <JCP|2> Ok I think the method was $.ajaxPrefilter
[21:59:16] <coldhead> and it sounds like it matters to your plugin anyway
[21:59:24] <JCP|2> I thought I could use it to replace my plugin
[22:00:09] <coldhead> ?ajaxprefilter
[22:00:13] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.ajaxPrefilter() - Handle custom Ajax options or modify existing options before each request is sent and before they are processed by $.ajax(). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[22:00:47] <JCP|2> Exactly, if I could use it to return a custom object instead to do a real ajax request it could replace my plugin
[22:01:23] <coldhead> maybe not relevant but the 1.5 rewrite replaces the native XHR with a custom object
[22:01:33] <JCP|2> I'm just trying to clean up my plugins I use in dev mode
[22:02:39] <JCP|2> Am I allowed to paste a few lines of codes here? I am not very good to explain
[22:03:03] <r3m> aste your code at http://jsfiddle.net
[22:03:34] <JCP|2> oh yeah forgot about that
[22:11:35] <JCP|2> coldhead: this is my plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/MY8Ng/6/
[22:11:47] <JCP|2> You will see a "live" use of it
[22:12:29] <JCP|2> Just to see if you think I could do that in the ajaxPrefiler() directly instead to extend getJSON
[22:21:55] <JCP|2> I'm falling asleep. I'll come back tomorrow. Have a good evening
[22:22:00] <JCP|2> or night ;)

[23:45:28] <gnarf> sup abjorn
[23:46:05] <abjorn> not much gnarf,
[23:46:09] <abjorn> i was playing around with node but
[23:46:12] <abjorn> not im too tired
[23:46:14] <abjorn> *now
[23:48:21] <coldhead> what's a guy to do, huh
[23:49:06] <abjorn> see, coldhead knows
[23:50:29] <abjorn> damnit why do people I don't know keep adding me as friends on steam
[23:52:09] <abjorn> seems the current node repo has some bugs in the CMake config that makes it break :( so no building on windows yet without cygwin
[23:52:43] <coldhead> that must be very upsetting
[23:52:51] <abjorn> so upsetting
[23:53:18] <abjorn> I've been waiting for the libuv and windows support in node to be mature enough to continue on with a project of mine
[23:53:29] <gnarf> abjorn: why not just use a VM?
[23:53:56] <coldhead> WHY NOT INDEED
[23:53:59] <abjorn> Well I'm going to depend on the libuv library they're working on to make it
[23:54:03] <abjorn> I do use node in a VM often
[23:54:14] <abjorn> but libuv isn't finished yet
[23:54:37] <abjorn> I will probably have to wait until Node 0.5
[23:56:11] <gnarf> v?
[23:56:13] <gnarf> uv?
[23:56:50] <abjorn> It's a wrapper library they're working on for Node. Node has been using libev and libeio for asynchronous io and event polling
[23:56:53] <SoulRaven> hi
[23:56:55] <abjorn> but that doesn't work on windows
[23:57:00] <abjorn> SoulRaven: sup
[23:57:23] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to have 2 modal windows? from the first modal to triger a secound modal window
[23:57:43] <SoulRaven> dialog, sorry, modal dialog
[23:57:44] <abjorn> gnarf: so they're working on a libuv, which wraps those two libraries, as well as some equivalent windows code (turns out windows has utilities for this in the windows api)
[23:58:06] <abjorn> SoulRaven: Well, it depends on the implementation
[23:58:14] <abjorn> I don't think jquery-ui would allow that, though
[23:58:32] <abjorn> And I can't think of a modal dialog implementation that would
[23:58:53] <SoulRaven> i want to display a modal dialog, and from the modal dialog to trigger a new modal dialog, for adding some data in mysql
[23:59:02] <MoTiOnXml> how do I compare two jQuery objects pointing to the same html element?
[23:59:18] <MoTiOnXml> the jQuery objects are different, i know that, but i want sort of the id of the html element
[23:59:33] <abjorn> "sort of" the id from the element?
[23:59:36] <MoTiOnXml> to do $(body) === $(body)
[23:59:45] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: sorry, it's early in the morning :)
