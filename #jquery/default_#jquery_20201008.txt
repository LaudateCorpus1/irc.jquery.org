[06:03:42] <SlippinJimmy> Hey fellas
[06:04:00] <SlippinJimmy> Does anyone have an idea why reply_data is returning as undefined here? https://pastebin.com/qZ8La7Zc
[06:04:12] <SlippinJimmy> I'm completely lost
[06:04:31] <SlippinJimmy> On L11
[06:20:45] <Uhkis> your backend is probably returning something else than json
[06:23:31] <SlippinJimmy> Thanks uhkis
[06:24:56] <Uhkis> SlippinJimmy: removing the dataType is probably enough to fix it
[06:26:34] <SlippinJimmy> Interestingly enough now simply nothing happens
[06:27:26] <SlippinJimmy> Could this be due to how var post_data was handled perhaps?
[06:27:27] <SlippinJimmy> https://pastebin.com/BM4wLynL
[06:29:17] <Uhkis> you might wanna put console.log(reply_data) before that if of yours
[06:29:40] <SlippinJimmy> Yeah I have - if I remove the json bit, it returns absolutely nothing - a blank output
[06:29:50] <SlippinJimmy> If I keep the json bit, it prints out 'null'. Hmm
[06:30:04] <Uhkis> so start debugging your backend then
[06:31:26] <SlippinJimmy> Fair enough
[06:56:15] <Cork> SlippinJimmy: would recommend checking in the browser network console what data it actually returns (and the Content-Type header)
[13:11:44] <kittonian> robertmaxrees, you around?
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> uh, i am, but please ask questions to the channel ;)
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> other people can help, too ;)
[13:12:32] <kittonian> no prob
[13:13:29] <kittonian> I am trying to figure out a way to change multiple html select boxes in order to reorder the numbering, based on whichever one the user sets to the number 1. I created a jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[13:14:13] <robertmaxrees> so you want to reorder them based on the number in the dropdown?
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaah not move in the DOM, just change the numbers.
[13:15:13] <kittonian> yes. it's for blog series where the order is best reversed. so instead of a user having to go through and renumber ever single one of them each time a post is made to that series, they can click the button and everything will reorder for them after they set the post they want to be number 1 to a value of 1
[13:15:30] <kittonian> just change the value of each select box
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> okay, so where are you stuck?
[13:15:47] <kittonian> pretty much at the beginning
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> ok.  so your first question is "how do i do something when a select changes value?"
[13:16:13] <kittonian> believe it or not, I actually finished recoding the entire blog and this is the very last thing to get working and I'm done
[13:16:42] <robertmaxrees> i would start with this article: https://learn.jquery.com/events/
[13:16:45] <kittonian> well, I have been reading and if you see what I've got already, you see that I can set the value of a select id on page load, but I need it onclick
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> *on change.
[13:16:58] <robertmaxrees> not click :)
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> check out the jquery learning center article on events and start there.
[13:17:12] <kittonian> no, i want the user to click the reorder posts button
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:17:33] <kittonian> i don't want anything to change until that button is click
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> right, but the event you want to listen to is the change event of the dropdown.
[13:17:36] <kittonian> *clicked
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[13:17:56] <robertmaxrees> lol - i know.  the change event is the proper event for something like this.  i promise.
[13:18:07] <kittonian> i believe you, was just explaining
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> lmao you started by disagreeting with me.  anyway, check out that learning center article and go from there.
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> work on getting the change event handler setup first.
[13:29:04] <conr> n>1+1
[13:29:18] <robertmaxrees> we don't have a bot in here ;)
[13:29:27] <conr> dang
[13:29:41] <conr> what am i doing wrong here?
[13:30:45] <conr> `const v = $('.selector');` `console.log(v.html())`; ?
[13:30:52] <conr> produces null
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: would need to see a fiddle.
[13:32:27] <robertmaxrees> examples like that out of context aren't really helpful since there are a ton of factors at play.
[13:34:35] <conr> one sec
[13:39:42] <conr> trying to check if this div has the class `ofh`. https://jsfiddle.net/d1tfwxy3/
[13:40:18] <conr> it does but still comes back false
[13:40:51] <robertmaxrees> so it's not "null", it's false ;)
[13:41:08] <robertmaxrees> and that's because you're using .children() wrong :)
[13:42:35] <conr> yup
[13:42:48] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[13:43:13] <conr> how can i use it "right"?
[13:43:42] <robertmaxrees> so step back - what are you trying to accomplish?  see if a particular div has a class?
[13:43:47] <conr> just `console.log(v.find('div').hasClass('ofh'));`?
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> well, it depends.
[13:44:14] <robertmaxrees> do you just care of any descendend element of v has that class?
[13:44:18] <conr> yes, but the first div:first-child
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> that div is not the first child of v.
[13:44:40] <robertmaxrees> can other divs have that class?
[13:44:54] <conr> oops i mean the first child of the 2nd level
[13:45:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking because i'd wonder if something like if (v.find('.ofh').length) { is enough here.
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> instead of traversing to find the div in a specific spot.
[13:45:44] <conr> what about `console.log(v.find('div.cntrct > div:first-child').hasClass('ofh'));`
[13:46:05] <robertmaxrees> you could do something like that, as well.
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> i just question whether or not you need something that complex :)
[13:46:36] <conr> im listening... :)
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> go back a few lines for my last suggestion.
[13:49:19] <conr> `v.find('.ofh').length` is simple but i like the output to be a boolean
[13:49:42] <robertmaxrees> Boolean(v.find('.ofh').length) :shrug:
[13:49:48] <robertmaxrees> dunno why that matters so much but there ya go.
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there are plenty of cases where using truthy/falsey values instead of Booleans is perfectly acceptable :)
[13:51:51] <conr> true
[13:53:33] <robertmaxrees> kittonian if you're stuck, feel free to say so :)
[13:59:14] <kittonian> robertmaxrees, not being a programmer, i am completely stuck
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> that's fine :) show me what you've got so far.
[13:59:43] <kittonian> nothing different than I had before
[13:59:49] <conr> i figured it out one page had another table i wasn't accounting for
[14:00:07] <conr> goddddd this markup is horrible
[14:00:29] <robertmaxrees> kittonian have you tried any code??  i'm trying to figure out what you've even tried to help steer you in the right direction.
[14:00:43] <kittonian> just reading docs
[14:01:00] <robertmaxrees> kittonian ok.  so what do you think you need to do?
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> instead of just reading docs, it's OK to try things :) jsfiddle is rad because you can experiment and nothing bad will happen.
[14:03:54] <kittonian> i know but when you don't know where to start or how to do any of this, it's hard to just start trying things
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> sure :)  so looking at the jquery docs i pointed you do, the basics page has this -> https://i.imgur.com/VMlnHlJ.png
[14:05:19] <kittonian> one of the issues is that you never know how many posts will be in a series so the id of seriesordernumber (i.e. seriesorder3, seriesorder4, etc.) can't be hard coded
[14:05:42] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  you can give them all a shared class and select on that instead.
[14:06:24] <robertmaxrees> for right now, try just getting the event listener to work on one select.  if it happens to work for all of them, even better :)
[14:07:11] <conr> robertmaxrees: what would be the way to select only divs with the class `.table_c` but with the child div `.cntrct` under it?
[14:07:30] <robertmaxrees> child or descendent?
[14:07:34] <conr> i tried `$('.table_c > div.cntrct').length` but its still the same
[14:07:38] <conr> descendent
[14:08:24] <robertmaxrees> well yeah, because you're not selecting .table_c :)  you want .filter(function() {})  - this is the swiss army knife of "how do i get x but only when it meets Y condition?"
[14:08:54] <conr> k
[14:09:06] <kittonian> yes, I got that part working. I can click the button and have it change one of the select box values https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[14:10:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> you're not passing 'event' to the function.
[14:10:28] <robertmaxrees> also: you can replace both of those lines with just $('#seriesorder4').val('2'); :)
[14:11:01] <kittonian> the event line was to prevent it from submitting the form, which it was doing without that line
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> kittonian yeah, i know - your fiddle is currently going to error, however.
[14:11:32] <robertmaxrees> $("#reorderposts").click(function() { needs to be $("#reorderposts").click(function(event) { - see how it's now passing the event object?
[14:12:48] <kittonian> ahh, ok updated.  but changing the two lines to the one line doesn't really help because I need it to change all select boxes other than the one set to a value of 1
[14:13:00] <kittonian> and I need them to increment by one so that everything is in order
[14:13:29] <kittonian> but again, i'll never know how many posts there are in a series, so I can't directly call the id one by one
[14:13:29] <robertmaxrees> kittonian it DOES help because you only need one line to change a select.  what you were doing before was overly complex :)  so you'll still use that knowledge.
[14:13:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:13:36] <kittonian> ok, fair enough
[14:14:11] <kittonian> updated again
[14:14:13] <robertmaxrees> you keep repeating things, disagreeing, doubting, etc.  it's getting really difficult to find the motivation to help you when you keep pushing bck.
[14:14:53] <kittonian> i'm just explaining. don't take it personally. i'm not "disagreeing or doubting", just having a conversation
[14:15:11] <kittonian> you know far more than i do
[14:15:40] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: it comes across as dismissive when i give you information and you say things like "but changing to lines to one like doesn't reall help"
[14:15:48] <robertmaxrees> *line
[14:15:55] <robertmaxrees> it will - just be patient :)
[14:15:56] <kittonian> again, just explaining
[14:16:03] <robertmaxrees> lol i know exactly what you want to do my dude.
[14:16:08] <kittonian> cool
[14:16:14] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[14:16:50] <robertmaxrees> so there's an issue here - currently you have no way of knowing which select was last "updated"
[14:17:05] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do this on button click, that is.
[14:17:09] <kittonian> meaning which select box was changed?
[14:17:14] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:17:16] <kittonian> ok
[14:18:08] <robertmaxrees> and actually, backing up - i see some UX issues here.  what should happen if the user changes them all to, say, '2'?
[14:18:13] <robertmaxrees> when you press the button, what should happen?>
[14:19:18] <kittonian> funny you should say that because I was thinking about that as well. my initial thought was that the reorder function wouldn't do anything. i already have a parsley validation check that kicks in when the user clicks the update button and ensures there are no duplicate values
[14:19:24] <kittonian> but i'm open to suggestions
[14:19:49] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:20:01] <robertmaxrees> so then this is going to get overly complex on button click.
[14:20:11] <kittonian> how so?
[14:21:18] <robertmaxrees> you have duplicate checks running, but then want to have things reorder on button click, so there'll be duplicates anyway.  there's also how to handle things like the user changing more than one select at a time.  the ordering will get REALLY weird then.
[14:23:18] <robertmaxrees> for instance: say you swap something into position 2 and something else into position 5 - you hit the button and things start shifting.  what happens to the element that was in position 4?  it would shift to 5, but you already said something else should go there.  does the element in position 4 wind up in position 6 instead?
[14:23:28] <kittonian> ok, a few thoughts. 1. parsley only runs on submit and that's a separate input type="submit". 2. can we base the reorder off of the selected value (i.e. <option value="3" selected>) instead of what the user may have changed it to?
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> "the selected value" and "what the user may have changed it to" are the same thing :)
[14:24:11] <robertmaxrees> but see my previous case.
[14:25:00] <kittonian> this reorder will only be used when a user submits a post and wants it to be first instead of last. if they just want to reorder the posts themselves, they would do so one by one and then click update. they wouldn't use the reorder button in that case.
[14:25:18] <robertmaxrees> so they can update one at a time?
[14:25:22] <robertmaxrees> and only one at a time?
[14:26:35] <kittonian> not trying to be difficult, but I just checked the html when a select value is changed and the selected tag does not move from the default
[14:27:00] <robertmaxrees> because that pane is not reflecting what you think it is :)
[14:27:47] <robertmaxrees> i assure you, the select property in the DOM is changing.
[14:28:03] <kittonian> what do you mean by one at a time? the user clicks the update button and all of the post numbering is modified. in this situation, i am not looking for anything to do with the form being submitted or actually changing the values. i only want the select box selections to be changed on the front end.
[14:28:25] <robertmaxrees> you're seeing the attribute - you never want to rely on attributes because they often don't reflect the actual statue of an element.
[14:28:29] <kittonian> gotcha on the DOM
[14:28:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm only talking about the frontend here.
[14:28:41] <kittonian> ok
[14:28:58] <robertmaxrees> walk through the process - a user changes a post to position 2 and another to position 5.
[14:29:09] <robertmaxrees> with me so far?
[14:29:13] <kittonian> i am
[14:29:22] <robertmaxrees> then they press the button to reorder.
[14:29:42] <robertmaxrees> what should happen to the element that was formerly in position 4?
[14:29:53] <kittonian> nothing, it shouldn't work at all
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:30:17] <robertmaxrees> bbiab meeting
[14:30:34] <kittonian> because this feature is only for changing the last post to position 1 and updating all other posts to their current value + 1
[14:36:46] <snackoverflow> can someone help me find out why im getting a 400 error? https://bpa.st/DR2A
[14:41:00] <robertmaxrees> alright back.
[14:41:33] <robertmaxrees> kittonian sounds like i'm way confused about this feature then hahaha
[14:42:02] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow what is your server expecting?  json?
[14:42:44] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: yes
[14:43:26] <kittonian> oh, that was fast. i thought you'd be gone for a while.
[14:43:43] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow that's why.  you're sending that data as a plain ol' post body.  probably want something like data: JSON.stringify({contamination_level': cl})
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> kittonian sometims meetings go short ;)
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> kittonian so the user can only change one select at a time, and they can only change that select to "1"?
[14:44:43] <kittonian> instead of adding a db column asking whether or not the series should be shown in reverse order, which would cause a number of other things to need to be recoded, I came up with the idea of clicking a button and allowing the user to set the last select box to 1 and have all other selects add 1 to their current value
[14:45:11] <kittonian> that way, it's a manual option of reversing a series post order
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:45:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not reversing order though.  that's moving a single post and shifting everything else by 1.
[14:45:45] <kittonian> we've been doing it by hand each month thus far but there are a lot of posts and changing every single select one at a time is cumbersome
[14:46:00] <kittonian> true, but that's the solution required here
[14:46:41] <robertmaxrees> so then it's not reversing order.  you're taking the "last" post and making it "first", yeah?
[14:47:05] <robertmaxrees> surprises me your DB isn't saving these as timestamped.  super easy to make that work.
[14:47:29] <kittonian> yes. that is the primary purpose of this, however, the thought came to mind that if post3 should be number 1, why not allow the reorder to also make that happen too
[14:47:57] <kittonian> my db is timestamping everything but it's far more complicated than just a simple order by asc or desc statement
[14:48:27] <kittonian> displaying a list in forward or reverse order is no problem, but there's a lot more going on than just that with these series posts
[14:48:54] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:49:18] <robertmaxrees> either way, so you just want to press the button and make the "last" post the "first" and then shift everything down by 1.
[14:50:38] <kittonian> or whichever select is set to 1, other than original select for post 1
[14:50:47] <kittonian> but yes, you're understanding
[14:51:33] <robertmaxrees> okay, so what happens if the user changes a select to 1 and other select to, say, 5?
[14:51:37] <robertmaxrees> or will you not allow that?
[14:52:05] <kittonian> if it's not the select's default on load value, clicking the reorder button should do nothing
[14:52:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked.
[14:52:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:52:32] <robertmaxrees> what happens then a user changes 2 selects at the same time?
[14:52:39] <kittonian> unless there is a way to make it so that this is all based off of what the original select value was for each post on page load
[14:53:00] <kittonian> sorry, i thought that's exactly what you asked
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> so the user will not be able to change more than 1 select at a time?
[14:53:28] <kittonian> right, that's what I answered. if a user changes more than one select the reorder button should do nothing
[14:53:30] <robertmaxrees> (y/n to that)
[14:53:44] <robertmaxrees> okay, so the user may not change more than 1 select at a time.
[14:54:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd almost argue that really you want to use a radio for this instead then.
[14:54:19] <kittonian> the user can change whatever they wish but the reorder button should not respond to anything other than setting a single post's select to a value of 1, as long as that select does not belong to post 1
[14:54:43] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:54:54] <kittonian> nah, because if a user wants to manually arrange the post order however they wish, they can do that and click update
[14:55:06] <kittonian> but the reorder button is only for this purpose
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> heh, okie.
[14:56:55] <robertmaxrees> so when you click reorder, you'll need to know if any selects were changed by user intervention.  we'll skip that part for now but will need to come back to it later.
[14:57:03] <kittonian> ok
[14:57:22] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you'll need to know which select is the "last" one.
[14:58:01] <kittonian> and by last you mean the one set to a value of 1, other than the select for post 1
[14:58:37] <robertmaxrees> using your example, I press the reorder button - which element goes where?
[14:58:37] <kittonian> i think the somewhat good news on that front is that post 1's select will always be named seriesorder1
[14:59:13] <robertmaxrees> so you want to move post 1 to be number 5?
[14:59:48] <kittonian> so I change the select on post 5 to a value of 1 and click reorder. post 1's select becomes a value of 2, post 2's select becomes a value of 3 and so on
[14:59:54] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[15:00:04] <robertmaxrees> we're talking about the case where the user has changed none of the selects.
[15:00:10] <kittonian> then nothing happens
[15:01:01] <robertmaxrees> lmao okay.  so then we need to know which select was updated.
[15:01:13] <kittonian> exactly
[15:01:30] <robertmaxrees> so we need to set up a change handler on the selects to add a class or something to signify that it has changed.
[15:01:42] <robertmaxrees> so I'd do that next.
[15:09:11] <robertmaxrees> start by just getting the listener bound to the selects.
[15:10:21] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like you target multiple elements at once, I'd suggest selecting on a class on the selects - '.seriesorder' might be a good place to start.
[15:11:05] <robertmaxrees> also: you can only omit the closing tags if you omit it for all of them in a select.  otherwise they all need a closing tag.
[15:19:54] <robertmaxrees> kittonian you stuck again?  it's ok to ask question :)
[15:20:45] <kittonian> i found a few examples regarding adding a class onchange and have it working but I'm trying to figure out how to remove that class when it's set back to its original value
[15:21:06] <robertmaxrees> you need to store the original value on the select - render it out that way on pageload.
[15:21:19] <robertmaxrees> data-default-value='2' or w/e
[15:22:06] <kittonian> not sure i'm following you there and don't know what w/e means
[15:22:11] <robertmaxrees> "whatever"
[15:22:16] <kittonian> ahh, lol
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> and you need to store the default value on the select element - data attributes are a great way to store information like that.
[15:22:35] <kittonian> you want me to add the code data-default-value to the select?
[15:22:48] <robertmaxrees> <select data-default-value="2">
[15:22:52] <kittonian> got it
[15:23:27] <robertmaxrees> then you check $(this).data('defaultValue').toString() === $(this).val();
[15:24:57] <kittonian> ok, updated
[15:25:06] <robertmaxrees> got that working?
[15:25:19] <kittonian> do i not have to tell it to removeclass somehow?
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't have the fiddle open - mind re-linking?
[15:25:40] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> so i understand where you're at/
[15:26:11] <robertmaxrees> right so
[15:26:35] <robertmaxrees> that line i posted earlier was for your if statement to determine if you should add or remove the class :)
[15:36:10] <kittonian> ok, got that working
[15:36:36] <robertmaxrees> cool.  so do you see an issue with your event handler?
[15:37:00] <kittonian> the issue i can see is that it's tied to a single id rather than all of them
[15:37:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.  notice anything unique about that line i shared your way a bit ago?
[15:38:06] <kittonian> the this part?
[15:38:12] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:38:14] <kittonian> i just updated
[15:38:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:38:36] <kittonian> but it's still tied to a single id for the listen event
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> lol i noticed ;)
[15:39:15] <robertmaxrees> so now you're wondering "how do i bind the listener to all the select elements?"
[15:39:20] <kittonian> exactly
[15:39:42] <kittonian> or more specifically, how do I bind it to seriesorderNUMBER
[15:39:50] <robertmaxrees> why not use a class selector?
[15:39:59] <kittonian> remember that this is a stripped down version of the actual form
[15:40:09] <kittonian> i would like to bind it to the id if possible
[15:40:19] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[15:40:28] <robertmaxrees> these selects should all have a semantic class added to them that they share.
[15:40:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to have to wrestle with an attribute selector for IDs which is... non-ideal.
[15:40:50] <kittonian> just asking, but why is that better than just using the id?
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> because what you want to do isn't "just using the id" :)
[15:41:20] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to use what's called an attribute selector.
[15:42:04] <robertmaxrees> and use a special one where you search for all elements where the id attribute starts with a particular string.  that's inefficient and cumbersome.  instead, give those selects a semantic classname and it'll make sure you life easier.
[15:43:11] <kittonian> ok done
[15:43:26] <robertmaxrees> what class did you give them?
[15:43:31] <kittonian> seriespostorder
[15:44:02] <robertmaxrees> cool.  so now you have two options - 1: select on that class and bind your event listeners directly, or 2: bind a delegated event listener for these.
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> the first of the two is incredibly trivial to do in this case - you just need to change the selector for your current handler to select that class.
[15:45:37] <kittonian> yup, done
[15:45:55] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[15:46:01] <robertmaxrees> so what next?
[15:46:42] <kittonian> shall i assume we now need to exclude seriesorder1 from the equation?
[15:46:58] <kittonian> oh, i guess not
[15:47:16] <kittonian> because we are looking for only a single select that has been changed in order to use this
[15:47:16] <robertmaxrees> :) sounds like you need to now get that reorder button working, yeah?
[15:47:28] <kittonian> yes, overthinking things
[15:47:52] <robertmaxrees> also: i might update that change handler to see if any other element has that "orderchange" class
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> but we can handle that later.
[15:49:00] <robertmaxrees> anyway, so now you'll want to update that click handler to get all the selects, omit the one that's been changed to 1, and then update the rest to be their value +1.
[15:49:29] <kittonian> yes, but that solution would only work if I only change the last select
[15:49:55] <kittonian> if I change one in the middle, i don't want all of the selects to update, only the ones previous to the one I changed
[15:49:57] <robertmaxrees> so then update that statement to be accurate :)
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> get all the selects between from the first one and the one that has been changed, then omit the one that's been changed to 1 as well as all subsequent selects, and then update the remaining selects to be their value +1.
[16:06:51] <kittonian> so how do i do that?
[16:07:04] <robertmaxrees> let's break it down :)
[16:07:15] <robertmaxrees> "get all the selects between from the first one and the one that has been changed"
[16:07:21] <kittonian> I have this so far: if ($(".seriespostorder")[0] && !$(".orderchange")[0]) {
[16:07:48] <kittonian> that's it :)
[16:07:48] <robertmaxrees> why do you have [0] on those?
[16:07:58] <kittonian> it was in an example i found
[16:08:14] <kittonian> obviously i should remove those, lol
[16:08:17] <robertmaxrees> let me re-phrase - do you understand what [0] does?
[16:08:35] <kittonian> no
[16:08:50] <robertmaxrees> it's grabbing the first DOM node in the jquery collection, which you don't want :)
[16:08:51] <kittonian> i thought it had something to do with gathering a list of elements
[16:08:58] <kittonian> ok, removed
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> so first off, just select all the selects and put that into a var.
[16:09:45] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about narrowing down that list yet.
[16:09:55] <robertmaxrees> the next thing you'll want to do is the the value of the changed select.
[16:10:32] <kittonian> var selects = $(".seriespostorder");
[16:10:35] <kittonian> is that right?
[16:10:57] <robertmaxrees> yep!  as convention, most people start vars holding jquery objects with $, but it's not a requirement.
[16:12:55] <robertmaxrees> now you just need to select the changed dropdown and get its value
[16:13:20] <kittonian> var changedselect = $(".seriespostorder") && $(".orderchange");
[16:13:24] <robertmaxrees> nope,.
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> that's just gonna return true :) you only need $('.orderchange') in this case.
[16:14:06] <robertmaxrees> and to get the value of that element, you'd use the .val() method.
[16:14:39] <kittonian> var changedselect = $(".orderchange").val();
[16:14:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:15:12] <robertmaxrees> tho i might make that something more like "changedselectvalue" but what you have will function.
[16:15:35] <kittonian> ok, changed
[16:16:14] <robertmaxrees> new fiddle link?
[16:16:40] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:17:09] <robertmaxrees> so both of those variables need to be inside that click handler.
[16:17:20] <robertmaxrees> or at least, the changedselectvalue one needs to be.
[16:17:39] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:18:32] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/vcMoTor.png
[16:18:47] <robertmaxrees> the changedselectvalue variable needs to be defined within the click handler.
[16:19:39] <kittonian> yeah, i updated
[16:20:19] <robertmaxrees> ah right, i keep having to press format on your code.
[16:20:24] <robertmaxrees> messing up the link.
[16:21:00] <robertmaxrees> so now you need all selects with values between 1 and whatever the changed value is.
[16:21:34] <kittonian> how do I do that?
[16:21:52] <robertmaxrees> to do this, i would use https://api.jquery.com/filter/ - but I would pass it a function.  .filter(function() { /* return if value is between 1 and changedselectvalue */ });
[16:26:54] <kittonian> yeah, i'm lost
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> so break the problem down :)
[16:27:22] <robertmaxrees> first step - run .filter() on $(".seriespostorder")
[16:28:25] <kittonian> selects.filter(function() {
[16:28:31] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:28:51] <kittonian> but i don't know how to do the filter
[16:28:57] <robertmaxrees> now in that function, you want to check if the current select is less than the changedselectvalue.
[16:29:43] <kittonian> if (select.val() < changedselectvalue) {
[16:30:00] <robertmaxrees> what is 'select' in this case?
[16:30:04] <kittonian> sorry selects
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> (you've almost got it bte.
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:30:36] <kittonian> if (selects.val() < changedselectvalue.val()) {
[16:30:38] <robertmaxrees> selects.val() will grab the value of the first select.  you need to check the "current" select.  remember how we did that in the change event handler?
[16:31:14] <kittonian> if (this.val() < changedselectvalue.val()) {
[16:31:33] <robertmaxrees> almost - don't know where the .val() for changedselectvalue came from.
[16:31:41] <kittonian> if (this.val() < changedselectvalue) {
[16:31:46] <robertmaxrees> and .val() only works for jquery objects.
[16:32:08] <robertmaxrees> notice something different about the way we use 'this' in the change handler?
[16:32:12] <kittonian> aren't these all jquery objects?
[16:32:32] <kittonian> if ($(this).val() < changedselectvalue) {
[16:32:46] <robertmaxrees> boom :)  NOW, there's a gotcha here.  .val() returns strings, not numbers.
[16:33:12] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to pass both of those through parseInt()
[16:33:34] <kittonian> if ($(this).val().parseInt() < changedselectvalue.parseInt()) {
[16:33:50] <robertmaxrees> no - parseInt() is a standalong function, not a method.
[16:33:54] <robertmaxrees> *standalone
[16:34:11] <kittonian> if ($(this).val() < changedselectvalue).parseInt()) {
[16:34:17] <robertmaxrees> still no.
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> it's a standalone function, not a method.
[16:34:54] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[16:35:31] <kittonian> if (parseInt($(this).val() < changedselectvalue))) {
[16:35:48] <robertmaxrees>  so you'll need to pass both of those through parseInt()
[16:35:50] <robertmaxrees> independently.
[16:35:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to make each one a number separately.
[16:36:14] <kittonian> if (parseInt($(this).val()) < parseInt(changedselectvalue))) {
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:37:55] <kittonian> actually I had one too many ) at the end
[16:37:59] <kittonian> but I've got it now
[16:38:03] <kittonian> ok, what's next
[16:38:11] <robertmaxrees> you just need to return that comparison out of the function.
[16:38:34] <kittonian> just type return?
[16:38:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:38:50] <robertmaxrees> show me what you think that statement means?
[16:39:24] <kittonian> the if statement?
[16:39:35] <robertmaxrees> "you just need to return that comparison out of the function."
[16:39:41] <kittonian> i means if 2 is less than 3
[16:39:43] <kittonian> *it
[16:39:45] <robertmaxrees> you said "just type return", but i'm not clear on what that response means.
[16:39:58] <robertmaxrees> so i'm asking you to show me what you mean by that.
[16:39:59] <kittonian> in the docs I saw the word return
[16:40:09] <kittonian> so I was asking if I just needed to type return
[16:40:11] <kittonian> but obviously not
[16:40:17] <kittonian> so how do I return the comparison?
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> you will need to type return, yes.
[16:40:36] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how to return out of a function in any programming languages?
[16:40:40] <kittonian> no
[16:40:43] <kittonian> i'm not a programmer
[16:41:14] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  sounds like you should take a javascript basics course then :)  either way, return foo < bar; is the basic format here./
[16:41:34] <robertmaxrees> where 'foo < bar' coule be any experession.
[16:41:59] <kittonian> return parseInt($(this).val()) < parseInt(changedselectvalue)
[16:42:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:42:07] <kittonian> ;
[16:42:45] <kittonian> ok
[16:43:15] <robertmaxrees> so what do you have now?
[16:43:44] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:44:09] <robertmaxrees> do me a favor and hit "tidy" in the upper-right of the javascript pane to fix the code formatting.
[16:44:32] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:44:50] <robertmaxrees> so why do you have the "if ($(".seriespostorder") && !$(".orderchange")) {" ?
[16:45:11] <kittonian> i just hit enter a few times to separate what was there from what we are doing now
[16:45:14] <kittonian> ignore that
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and delete it then, you don't need it :)_
[16:45:49] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need if (parseInt($(this).val()) < parseInt(changedselectvalue)) {
[16:45:56] <robertmaxrees> you just need the return bit in the .filter()
[16:46:25] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:46:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  now your code is invalid.
[16:46:45] <robertmaxrees> might wanna fix that up.
[16:47:42] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:48:12] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/SnKUcHR.png notice that red dot and red underline?
[16:48:16] <robertmaxrees> that means something is invalid.
[16:48:28] <robertmaxrees> so correct the error :)
[16:48:39] <kittonian> refresh, i did
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> okay, so now you want to go through each of those selects and update their value to add 1, right?
[16:49:56] <kittonian> yup
[16:50:06] <robertmaxrees> you can use .each() for that.
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> docs are here: https://api.jquery.com/each/
[16:51:25] <kittonian> what am I using the .each() on?
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> "so now you want to go through each of those selects and update their value to add 1, right?"
[16:51:59] <kittonian> yes, i understand what we're doing, i just don't understand what to call the .each() on
[16:52:06] <kittonian> what's the name of this return?
[16:52:14] <robertmaxrees> "name of this return"?
[16:52:23] <robertmaxrees> and you running on the result of the filter.
[16:52:25] <kittonian> we just returned the function value right?
[16:52:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:52:39] <kittonian> so it's filter.each()
[16:52:53] <robertmaxrees> show me what you think that means.
[16:52:57] <kittonian> i just did
[16:53:05] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle.
[16:53:21] <kittonian> i don't know what specifically goes in front of the .each()
[16:53:25] <kittonian> that's what I'm asking
[16:53:37] <kittonian> selects.each()
[16:53:38] <robertmaxrees> did you look at the documentation at all?
[16:53:41] <kittonian> yes
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> what does that show you in the examples?
[16:54:04] <kittonian> you have to realize that I'm doing the best I can but reading through programming docs doesn't always make sense when you're not a programmer
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - the idea is to help you learn how to do this on your own.
[16:54:52] <kittonian> $( "li" ).each(function( index ) {
[16:55:00] <kittonian> see the $( "li") part?
[16:55:03] <kittonian> that's what I'm asking about
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> okay so - most jquery methods (like .filter()) return a jquery object.  so instead of $('li'), you'd just chain .each() onto the .filter() you just did.
[16:56:49] <kittonian> yeah, i don't understand what you're saying
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[16:57:01] <kittonian> how do I chain it onto the filter?
[16:57:36] <robertmaxrees> ah - chaining means basically .filter(/* whatever here */).each(/* whatever here */)
[16:57:37] <kittonian> are you saying to just add .each() to the line? selects.filter(function().each()
[16:58:06] <robertmaxrees> .filter(function() {}).each(function() {}) etc.
[16:58:25] <robertmaxrees> you can chain most jquery methods like this because most of them return a jquery object, which is what $() returns :)
[16:59:03] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[16:59:15] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[16:59:31] <kittonian> ok, now what?
[16:59:40] <robertmaxrees> well, break down the steps from earlier :)
[17:00:16] <robertmaxrees> if the goal is to increment each select's value by one, right now oyu've got a single select - what's the first step in that process?
[17:00:23] <kittonian> i understand what we want to accomplish next (add 1 to each of these selects in the filter) but how do I do that?
[17:00:33] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm trying to teach out.
[17:00:34] <robertmaxrees> *you
[17:00:46] <robertmaxrees> to add 1 to the value, it might help to get the value, no?
[17:01:08] <kittonian> ok
[17:02:00] <kittonian> i know that I add .val() to get the value (or better yet parseInt(something.val())
[17:02:07] <kittonian> but what's the something?
[17:02:22] <robertmaxrees> what have you used every single time you've needed "the current element"?
[17:02:29] <kittonian> $(this)
[17:02:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:02:40] <kittonian> and do I use parseInt?
[17:03:00] <robertmaxrees> well, if you need to do arithmetic, you'll need numbers.  if .val() returns strings, what do you think?
[17:03:37] <kittonian> parseInt($(this).val());
[17:03:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd store that in a variable so you know have to do it once.
[17:04:25] <kittonian> val orderval = parseInt($(this).val());
[17:04:40] <robertmaxrees> sure :) whatever name makes sense to you.
[17:05:04] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think you need to do next?
[17:05:40] <kittonian> loop through each of the orderval objects and add 1
[17:05:54] <robertmaxrees> almost.
[17:06:07] <robertmaxrees> right now you're going through all of the selects one by one to change them.
[17:06:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're already looping.
[17:06:40] <kittonian> so i just need to add 1
[17:06:43] <robertmaxrees> right now, thing about what you need to do to each individual select.  you have a select, you've got it's value as a number.
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> add 1 and then set the selects value to that new number, yep!
[17:07:16] <kittonian> will that work?
[17:07:16] <robertmaxrees> (also it's var not val :) )
[17:07:24] <robertmaxrees> will what work?
[17:08:02] <kittonian> if I just set the option's value="" to a number, it won't change what is shown on the web page, and I just want it to go to the next value in the option's list of each select
[17:08:20] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting the value=""?
[17:08:34] <kittonian> value="3"
[17:08:43] <robertmaxrees> via what mechanism though?>
[17:08:48] <robertmaxrees> the inspector tab or something?
[17:08:49] <kittonian> it's a db call
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> you lost me.  we're not looking at anything but this page.
[17:09:20] <robertmaxrees> please just keep working with me - you'll see how this works.
[17:09:26] <kittonian> ok
[17:09:49] <robertmaxrees> so you need to add 1 to the value and then set the dropdown to the new value.
[17:09:59] <kittonian> yes
[17:10:08] <robertmaxrees> so how do you normally add numbers?
[17:10:12] <kittonian> +1
[17:10:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> and you set the value of the select using .val(theNewValueHere)
[17:11:10] <kittonian> orderval + 1;
[17:11:19] <robertmaxrees> that'
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> *that is indeed how you add things :)
[17:11:43] <kittonian> orderval.val(order + 1);
[17:11:49] <kittonian> orderval.val(orderval + 1);
[17:12:18] <kittonian> $(this).val(orderval + 1);
[17:12:52] <kittonian> no?
[17:12:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:12:55] <kittonian> oh ok
[17:12:57] <robertmaxrees> which do you think it is?
[17:13:03] <kittonian> the last one
[17:13:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:13:19] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw, sometimes i have to step away or attend to my job, so please be patient.
[17:13:33] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[17:13:42] <kittonian> of course. i thought you were just waiting for me to get it right
[17:14:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:14:54] <robertmaxrees> so does that at least partially work?
[17:15:02] <kittonian> heh, haven't tried
[17:15:13] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:15:31] <robertmaxrees> that's one of the great things about programming - if you try and it doesn't work, no harm no foul.
[17:15:45] <robertmaxrees> even better, if you try and it throws an error, you get a clue on what to fix next.
[17:16:53] <kittonian> it's changing the numbers sort of but not in the way i need it to
[17:17:22] <robertmaxrees> be more specific.
[17:18:08] <kittonian> try it out. i set post 3 to 1 and clicked the button and nothing happens. if I set it post 3 to 2 then post 1 changes to 2
[17:19:09] <robertmaxrees> so where do you start with debugging this?
[17:19:21] <kittonian> nowhere. you just asked me to try it and report back
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:19:52] <kittonian> and it appears we also need to remove the orderchange class once the button is clicked so that nothing happens if you click it again
[17:20:10] <robertmaxrees> "we" aren't doing anything - you are :)
[17:20:15] <robertmaxrees> that's the whole point of this exercise.
[17:22:27] <kittonian> well I don't have anything that works remotely close yet
[17:22:39] <robertmaxrees> correct, because we're still working on making it work.
[17:23:21] <kittonian> ok, but you are asking me about debugging and I have no idea where to even start on that. at best I'm trying to read the docs you've provided, understand what each line is doing and come up with the correct syntax
[17:23:28] <kittonian> so what do we do next?
[17:24:45] <robertmaxrees> ask questions instead of saying "it's broken" and "we need to do xyz" :)  so we need to figure out where things are going wrong.  that filter would be a good first choice.
[17:28:45] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your browser's developer tools?
[17:30:46] <kittonian> like inspect element and clicking on console to see if there's an error?
[17:30:52] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[17:30:58] <kittonian> of course
[17:31:04] <robertmaxrees> can also use console.log() to check variables and the like.
[17:31:40] <robertmaxrees> so try to console.log(changedselectedvalue) before that filter.
[17:33:53] <robertmaxrees> (this first bug made me giggle the moment i figured it out)
[17:35:21] <kittonian> says changedselectvalue is not defined
[17:35:30] <kittonian> does that mean it needs to go in the filter?
[17:35:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:35:44] <robertmaxrees> no, you defined it before the filter.
[17:35:49] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're doing?
[17:35:55] <kittonian> Uncaught ReferenceError: changedselectedvalue is not defined
[17:36:07] <robertmaxrees> lost the link again - show me what you're doing?
[17:36:21] <kittonian> https://jsfiddle.net/kittonian/L86rh34p/
[17:36:48] <robertmaxrees> you have console.log(changedselectedvalue)
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> that is not what the variable is named :)
[17:37:25] <kittonian> i corrected it
[17:37:29] <kittonian> now console returns 1
[17:37:41] <robertmaxrees> see the issue with that?
[17:37:54] <kittonian> it's not less than, it's equal to
[17:38:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you don't care that it was set to 1, you care what it was originally :)
[17:39:05] <kittonian> ok
[17:39:57] <kittonian> but i'm still not understanding where the problem is in the code
[17:40:49] <robertmaxrees> var changedselectvalue = $(".orderchange").val(); is getting the current value of the changed select, which right now will always be "1"
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> but you don't care about that new value, you care about the original value of that dropdown.
[17:42:19] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[17:43:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d4yh276u/2/
[17:44:00] <robertmaxrees> here.
[17:44:03] <robertmaxrees> just take this.
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> additionally, please refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn and https://learn.jquery.com/.  codecademy and the like are also excellent resources.
[17:46:47] <kittonian> that's great. thank you
[17:47:01] <robertmaxrees> please go learn the basics - they will serve you well.
[17:47:06] <kittonian> is it possible to add one more piece of functionality?
[17:47:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:47:11] <kittonian> lol
[17:47:16] <robertmaxrees> because that's not the intent of this channel.
[17:47:49] <robertmaxrees> the point of this channel is to get support to help you learn - this has devolved into me spoonfeeding the code.  so have that first part for free.  please check out the resources available to figure out the rest :)
[17:49:00] <kittonian> fair enough. it works well enough to do the job. the only thing I was going to ask was if someone makes a mistake and selects the wrong post and needs to change to the correct post, whether or not the original selected value of each could be used to reorder again without reloading the page
[17:49:09] <robertmaxrees> that's on you.
[17:49:13] <kittonian> but for right now they can just reload
[17:49:31] <kittonian> i appreciate your time and help
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> i offer no support for that code - it breaks or needs modification, that's on you :)
[18:05:12] <kittonian> i actually found a bug in your code and fixed it
[18:05:29] <robertmaxrees> *your* code, not mine.
[18:05:39] <kittonian> sure
