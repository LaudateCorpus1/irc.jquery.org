[03:27:42] <RedShift> hi all
[03:28:22] <RedShift> when I send in the text string "000" through the data option of $.ajax, jquery converts that string into an integer 0
[03:28:28] <RedShift> how can I prevnt that from happening?
[03:29:26] <Uhkis> RedShift: make a fiddle
[03:45:50] <RedShift> never mind, found the issue
[03:45:53] <RedShift> it was within my own code
[03:46:15] <RedShift> right when I was testing this again I got a hunch
[03:48:16] <Prabhat> Why grand total not updated when i click remove record?
[03:49:17] <Prabhat> any solution?

[04:53:23] <dddh> hi
[05:08:14] <lumidee> Hi, i noticed that with the tooltip plugin 'tooltipster' the tooltip position is misplaced, when applying a float on the tooltip selector element. There's a callback function to retrieve and set the 'new position' in tooltipster development version 4, but i wonder if you can recommend me another tooltip plugin, which has this implemented in an already stable release? (just need an interactive tooltip which is created, after clicking on an element and
[05:08:14] <lumidee> closed when you click outside the tooltip.) jquery-ui looks very big compared to the other tooltip plugins. i just worry it might be bloated for my use case. Not sure if powertip has repositioning implemented
[05:20:45] <lumidee> ah, i could fix my issue. i had to just select the image and not the <span> around the image for tooltipster to properly recognize the image position after float:right. found the hint here: https://github.com/stevenbenner/jquery-powertip/issues/125

[19:04:11] <wa5ted> hey
[19:04:36] <wa5ted> anyone know what the input type for credit cards are (i want to be able to offer the ability for users to use credit card auto complete)
[21:13:52] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/hwp0d5vu/1/ looking to see what I might be doing wrong or if this is even possible.  When I load a list of games based off a forloop i attach a pauseAll function to my button.  What I'd like to do is when I hit that button I want to retriggger my showgamedata function which replaces a div tag with updated information.  The fuction works and everything updates in the database
[21:13:52] <DexDeadly> however instead of total page refresh I'd like just that function to refresh the div
[21:14:16] <DexDeadly> or is it not possible what I am trying to do
[21:18:29] <DexDeadly> nm of course now it works
[21:31:42] <DexDeadly> Can you change the ok and cancel verbage on a confirm box?
[21:49:01] <shoky> nope
[22:41:18] <DexDeadly> Really, thats kind of crappy
[22:45:08] <shoky> you can make your own
[22:47:19] <DexDeadly> Modal?
[22:47:21] <DexDeadly> like that
[22:53:17] <shoky> ya
[22:53:59] <DexDeadly> I mean its not like completely needed to say yes no so I guess I'll leave it be.  Actually I have a question.  I have a modal popup where I edit a game.  Anyway after submitting the form on the modal I can get it to repopulate the page with data thats already there
[22:54:18] <shoky> put an overlay transparent element above everything (with css) to block interaction
[22:54:22] <shoky> gnight
[22:54:50] <DexDeadly> night
