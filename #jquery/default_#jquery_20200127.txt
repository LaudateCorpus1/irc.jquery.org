[08:53:56] <kristjanman2k20> I have a question that I asked also yesterday
[08:54:41] <kristjanman2k20> My java server response sends me a JSON with characters written correct. But when I display them on the webpage, some are wrong
[08:54:54] <kristjanman2k20> even though content type is right
[08:55:07] <kristjanman2k20> everything should be Utf-8
